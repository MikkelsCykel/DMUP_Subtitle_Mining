1
00:00:51,316 --> 00:00:53,084
Give me a break.

2
00:00:56,154 --> 00:00:58,724
- You guys excited?
- Dream come true.

3
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:00,826
Yeah, Europe again.

4
00:01:00,926 --> 00:01:03,562
It's just my parents trying
to get rid of me for two months.

5
00:01:03,595 --> 00:01:04,997
What else is new?

6
00:01:05,064 --> 00:01:06,999
Swell, when's your mom
leaving for Australia?

7
00:01:07,033 --> 00:01:10,070
In about an hour and a half.
I can't wait.

8
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:12,205
I'm getting rid of her
for two whole months.

9
00:01:12,271 --> 00:01:15,275
I don't understand. Your mom
can afford to go to Australia...

10
00:01:15,308 --> 00:01:18,678
but can't afford to send you to Europe
with some friends for graduation?

11
00:01:18,712 --> 00:01:22,249
- Aren't you pissed you can't go?
- Her boyfriend's paying for it.

12
00:01:22,316 --> 00:01:24,318
He wants her to see
his sheep ranch.

13
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:28,422
Besides, she needs the growing
experience more than I do.

14
00:01:28,522 --> 00:01:31,759
She's leaving you guys all alone?
What about the kids, hmm?

15
00:01:31,826 --> 00:01:35,964
Kenny will watch Zach, Melissa will
watch Walter, and I'll have Mom's car.

16
00:01:35,997 --> 00:01:38,634
I can go to the beach,
stay out as late as I want.

17
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,803
I can do anything.
I'm a free woman.

18
00:01:42,872 --> 00:01:45,007
Melissa, lunch, honey.

19
00:01:45,041 --> 00:01:46,542
- Come on.
- Right.

20
00:01:58,955 --> 00:02:01,191
Melissa, right now.

21
00:02:01,292 --> 00:02:04,829
- Elvis needs fresh water.
- I'll do it in a minute.

22
00:02:04,929 --> 00:02:07,265
Zach, put it back.

23
00:02:07,365 --> 00:02:11,202
Right now.
Ifyou need money, ask me first.

24
00:02:11,236 --> 00:02:13,772
- Can I have ten dollars?
- Forget it.

25
00:02:13,838 --> 00:02:15,974
Fry, you suckers.

26
00:02:17,209 --> 00:02:19,678
Earth to Melissa.

27
00:02:19,745 --> 00:02:21,647
How come you gotta go?

28
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,452
Because I've had a very rough 37 years
and I need a break.

29
00:02:26,486 --> 00:02:28,321
You swore you'd
sign me up for baseball.

30
00:02:28,387 --> 00:02:32,125
- Little League will be there next year.
- So will Australia.

31
00:02:32,192 --> 00:02:34,127
- I wish Dad were around.
- No, you don't.

32
00:02:36,763 --> 00:02:38,665
Kenny, give me a break.

33
00:02:38,765 --> 00:02:41,335
You haven't taken out the trash
in weeks, the lawn needs mowing...

34
00:02:41,401 --> 00:02:43,837
and your room looks
like a disaster area!

35
00:02:49,044 --> 00:02:51,546
- See you, Swell.
- Bye-bye.

36
00:02:53,081 --> 00:02:56,218
Stay away from her.
She's in one of her Terminator moods.

37
00:02:56,284 --> 00:02:57,386
Hey, Nicole.

38
00:03:06,629 --> 00:03:09,232
Swell, have my baby.

39
00:03:09,332 --> 00:03:11,368
In your dreams, babe.

40
00:03:12,769 --> 00:03:14,204
Hi, Mom.

41
00:03:15,472 --> 00:03:19,209
Why did you leave
your dishes in the sink for me?

42
00:03:19,276 --> 00:03:21,912
God, you take these things
so personally.

43
00:03:22,013 --> 00:03:24,882
- The dishwasher's full.
- So empty it.

44
00:03:24,949 --> 00:03:26,918
That's Kenny's job.

45
00:03:27,018 --> 00:03:29,487
Kenny, get back here!

46
00:03:29,554 --> 00:03:31,056
Right now!

47
00:03:31,089 --> 00:03:34,092
I'll do it later, Mom!
I promise!

48
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:36,962
Is your mom leavin'
for like months?

49
00:03:37,028 --> 00:03:39,565
Shit, you're right.
Bye, Mom!

50
00:03:39,632 --> 00:03:41,700
- Have a blast!
- Right.

51
00:03:41,767 --> 00:03:43,803
Rock and roll!

52
00:03:47,773 --> 00:03:50,310
- No prizes.
- Hey, Swell.

53
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:54,447
As usual, your brother's proven he's not
the least bit involved with this family.

54
00:03:54,515 --> 00:03:57,485
Relax, Mom.
I'll keep him in line.

55
00:03:57,551 --> 00:04:00,254
Did you see his report card?
He got all D's.

56
00:04:00,321 --> 00:04:01,689
Did you yell at him?

57
00:04:01,755 --> 00:04:04,258
No. I couldn't.
It's an improvement.

58
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:06,961
Mom, takin' off on us
like that, huh?

59
00:04:07,061 --> 00:04:09,297
Shirkin' all that
parental responsibility.

60
00:04:09,364 --> 00:04:12,967
Oh, I'm sure everything
will be taken care of.

61
00:04:13,035 --> 00:04:15,904
Yeah. Relax, Mom.

62
00:04:15,971 --> 00:04:18,541
Everything's gonna be great
when you're gone.

63
00:04:43,334 --> 00:04:45,169
Hello, dear.

64
00:04:45,236 --> 00:04:48,039
I'm Mrs. Sturak.
I'm the baby-sitter.

65
00:04:49,707 --> 00:04:50,875
What?

66
00:04:51,976 --> 00:04:54,479
- Mother?
- She seems very nice.

67
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:57,616
Right? And she has
lots of experience.

68
00:04:57,682 --> 00:05:01,187
Of course she does.
She's 200 years old.

69
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:03,623
It's not fair.
Baby-sitters suck.

70
00:05:05,658 --> 00:05:08,227
- Mrs. Sturak.
- Yes?

71
00:05:08,294 --> 00:05:11,498
You know there are
five children?

72
00:05:11,564 --> 00:05:14,901
- Yes, of course.
- Do you thinkyou can handle the job?

73
00:05:14,935 --> 00:05:17,571
Of course I can.
My family's all gone.

74
00:05:17,638 --> 00:05:20,541
Taking care of others' little ones
is my whole life.

75
00:05:20,608 --> 00:05:23,577
I didn't get a chance
to go to the store...

76
00:05:23,645 --> 00:05:27,883
but there's money in here for groceries
and some spending money for the kids.

77
00:05:27,983 --> 00:05:32,187
There's also a list of instructions,
and the phone number in Australia.

78
00:05:32,221 --> 00:05:35,290
- You go have a lovely time.
- Thankyou.

79
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:37,959
Walter, come give Mommy a kiss.

80
00:05:40,529 --> 00:05:42,431
Bye, Elvis.

81
00:05:42,498 --> 00:05:44,901
Melissa, want to
come down from there?

82
00:05:44,934 --> 00:05:47,937
- No.
- Get down from there.

83
00:05:51,741 --> 00:05:54,845
I can't believe you're
doing this to me. A baby-sitter?

84
00:05:54,945 --> 00:05:57,748
Honey, I couldn't
leave you kids all alone.

85
00:05:57,815 --> 00:06:01,619
You're not capable of running the show
while I'm gone. You're not an adult yet.

86
00:06:01,685 --> 00:06:05,991
Now, I know we've been over this
at least a thousand times...

87
00:06:06,023 --> 00:06:09,027
but please, don't do anything
you know I'd be against.

88
00:06:09,093 --> 00:06:12,063
I don't wanna hearyou've given
this nice old lady a hard time.

89
00:06:12,097 --> 00:06:14,867
You're gonna miss your flight.

90
00:06:14,933 --> 00:06:18,704
Promise me you'll go register
at City College for fall, okay?

91
00:06:19,772 --> 00:06:21,807
I haven't quite
decided on that yet.

92
00:06:23,175 --> 00:06:24,643
I'll miss you.

93
00:06:27,313 --> 00:06:29,316
- Bye, Mom.
- Yeah.

94
00:06:29,382 --> 00:06:32,953
Bye, everybody.
Listen to Mrs. Sturak.

95
00:06:33,019 --> 00:06:35,689
Mom, can you call us every day?

96
00:06:35,789 --> 00:06:39,793
Walter, this is Mom's vacation,
but I'll try.

97
00:06:39,827 --> 00:06:41,929
Mrs. Sturak knows
where to reach me.

98
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:44,465
Bye, sweetheart.
Be good.

99
00:06:44,499 --> 00:06:48,036
Love you. Bye, honey.
Be good, everybody!

100
00:06:48,102 --> 00:06:50,772
Take care of each other!

101
00:07:07,223 --> 00:07:10,594
You little maggots, line up!
Time to go over the rules!

102
00:07:10,627 --> 00:07:13,030
Excuse me?
Are you serious?

103
00:07:13,063 --> 00:07:16,833
You can't run a tight ship
without rules. Now move!

104
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:21,305
- What's this lady's problem?
- I'm scared.

105
00:07:21,372 --> 00:07:23,140
I am too.

106
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:26,677
Lady, I don't know what your deal is,
but you're not here to order us around.

107
00:07:26,711 --> 00:07:28,947
I've had about enough
ofyour lip, missy.

108
00:07:29,814 --> 00:07:31,116
Cooperate...

109
00:07:31,149 --> 00:07:34,720
or I'll make your summer
a living hell!

110
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:46,232
Dr.. Louise Westheimer..

111
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:47,934
Alaska.

112
00:07:49,435 --> 00:07:52,372
Alaska-- Alaska container.

113
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,108
Alaska spill.

114
00:07:54,174 --> 00:07:56,643
Hey! I was watching that!

115
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:58,478
TV rots your brains.

116
00:08:02,516 --> 00:08:04,252
Go to your room.

117
00:08:04,352 --> 00:08:08,190
I expect a complete report tomorrow
morning on the life of the aardvark.

118
00:08:26,876 --> 00:08:30,180
Cynthia, you're my moon goddess.

119
00:08:36,186 --> 00:08:38,655
Time for little boys
to be in bed.

120
00:08:38,755 --> 00:08:40,658
Can't you see
I'm in the middle of a date?

121
00:08:40,758 --> 00:08:44,562
And time for little trollops
to go home!

122
00:08:44,629 --> 00:08:47,899
Wait! You can't.
Cynthia, wait!

123
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,435
I'll call you later.

124
00:08:51,437 --> 00:08:53,005
Darling.

125
00:08:55,674 --> 00:08:59,845
It's time for little girls
to dress like little girls.

126
00:08:59,912 --> 00:09:01,781
Sugar and spice!

127
00:09:34,316 --> 00:09:36,485
God is definitely
pissed off at me.

128
00:09:36,552 --> 00:09:39,021
I have no money.
I have no boyfriend.

129
00:09:39,121 --> 00:09:41,524
You guys are gonna be
in Europe all summer.

130
00:09:41,558 --> 00:09:45,127
Yeah, my mom left us with
this deranged Mary Poppins.

131
00:09:45,195 --> 00:09:47,731
We've gotta get rid
of the old lady.

132
00:09:48,999 --> 00:09:51,768
Nicole, hang on.
Why are you wearing name tags?

133
00:09:51,835 --> 00:09:55,506
- She has trouble remembering things.
- We're to wear them at all times.

134
00:09:55,606 --> 00:09:59,644
She's getting us up at the butt-crack
of dawn to tidy up the garage.

135
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:02,213
Oh, God. Nicole,
I have to call you back.

136
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,115
All right. Bye.

137
00:10:04,182 --> 00:10:06,117
I really don't think
I can live like this.

138
00:10:06,184 --> 00:10:09,854
Okay, I'll talk to her.
It's time we let her know the rules.

139
00:10:09,922 --> 00:10:12,891
- Yeah, we outnumber her.
- Let's kick some ass.

140
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:34,415
Probably can't even hear me.

141
00:10:36,484 --> 00:10:37,651
Look, Mrs. Sturak.

142
00:10:37,685 --> 00:10:40,087
Whetheryou thinkyou can
push us around or not...

143
00:10:40,121 --> 00:10:43,057
we've decided that we're not
gonna take any more ofyour crap.

144
00:10:54,036 --> 00:10:56,806
First of all,
the name tags have gotta go.

145
00:10:56,872 --> 00:10:59,709
Mrs. Sturak,
are you even listening to me?

146
00:11:26,805 --> 00:11:28,407
Oh, my God.

147
00:11:35,047 --> 00:11:36,014
Fuck.

148
00:11:38,151 --> 00:11:39,886
Hey, get out.

149
00:11:39,952 --> 00:11:42,455
Kenny, come downstairs.
You're not gonna believe this.

150
00:11:46,359 --> 00:11:50,530
I told you to talk to her. Didn't want
you to send her to the glue factory.

151
00:11:50,597 --> 00:11:53,734
I didn't kill her.
She died in her sleep.

152
00:11:53,801 --> 00:11:55,636
Probably choked on her whistle.

153
00:11:55,736 --> 00:11:58,272
- She doesn't look dead.
- That's 'cause it just happened.

154
00:11:58,372 --> 00:12:01,142
So you can't really tell,
like a MacGyver..

155
00:12:01,175 --> 00:12:03,611
What should we do with her body?

156
00:12:05,013 --> 00:12:07,449
Call an ambulance? Call the cops?
I don't know.

157
00:12:07,515 --> 00:12:09,651
They're gonna ask us
a lot of questions.

158
00:12:09,718 --> 00:12:11,653
They'll probably blame us.

159
00:12:11,687 --> 00:12:14,423
- They'll definitely call Mom.
- She'll blame us.

160
00:12:14,456 --> 00:12:17,527
She'll hop the next flight home,
and then she'll be in our faces.

161
00:12:17,593 --> 00:12:20,263
- I don't want Mom to come home.
- I don't either.

162
00:12:23,766 --> 00:12:25,735
- Easy.
- She's starting to stink.

163
00:12:25,769 --> 00:12:27,771
It's too soon.
It must be you.

164
00:12:27,837 --> 00:12:29,540
- Shut up.
- Be careful.

165
00:12:29,573 --> 00:12:32,075
- I got her.
- I mean my skateboard.

166
00:12:32,176 --> 00:12:33,944
You ran over my foot.

167
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:38,816
Sure she's gonna fit?

168
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:41,118
How should I know?
I've never done this before.

169
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:43,221
Well, neither have I.

170
00:12:43,287 --> 00:12:45,623
I think we should
measure her first.

171
00:12:45,657 --> 00:12:48,827
- Let's hack off her head!
- Yeah!

172
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:51,897
All right, go get that
metal tape measure out of the garage.

173
00:12:51,964 --> 00:12:55,067
Would you stop ordering us around?
You're not the baby-sitter.

174
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:57,503
That's right, Kenny.
The baby-sitter is dead.

175
00:12:57,570 --> 00:12:59,538
Now just do it.

176
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:03,676
We're saving the ambulance people
a trip, right?

177
00:13:03,776 --> 00:13:06,947
When they find her,
they'll take care of everything.

178
00:13:07,013 --> 00:13:09,016
And no one has to know
she was our sitter.

179
00:13:09,082 --> 00:13:13,620
She said she didn't
have any family, so this is--

180
00:13:13,687 --> 00:13:15,990
This is really
the decent thing to do.

181
00:13:27,202 --> 00:13:29,070
Hey, Bobby.

182
00:13:34,977 --> 00:13:37,146
Now, who would do such a thing?

183
00:13:39,782 --> 00:13:41,751
It's the lifting that gets me.

184
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:49,426
God, I feel terrible.

185
00:13:50,327 --> 00:13:52,763
I should've been nicer to her.

186
00:13:52,863 --> 00:13:55,099
I should've cooperated.

187
00:13:55,165 --> 00:13:58,536
Yeah. She was a great baby-sitter.

188
00:14:03,475 --> 00:14:06,611
- Where are you going?
- I'm going shopping for food.

189
00:14:06,711 --> 00:14:09,848
Yeah! Massive party supplies!
I got shotgun!

190
00:14:15,254 --> 00:14:17,222
You're taking Mrs. Sturak's car?

191
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:22,462
Zach, life goes on.

192
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:25,866
I mean, come on.
This car's a classic.

193
00:14:25,932 --> 00:14:29,703
I think that she'd
want it this way, don't you?

194
00:14:35,209 --> 00:14:37,144
How much did Mom leave us?

195
00:14:40,648 --> 00:14:42,584
There's no money in here.

196
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:44,853
I saw Mom give it
to Mrs. Sturak.

197
00:14:44,953 --> 00:14:47,222
Well, she must've
taken it out.

198
00:14:51,092 --> 00:14:52,127
Holy shit!

199
00:15:03,674 --> 00:15:07,143
- Where is the damn thing?
- Shoot!

200
00:15:07,211 --> 00:15:09,012
Out of my way!

201
00:15:10,614 --> 00:15:13,150
Come on! Come on!

202
00:15:13,217 --> 00:15:15,753
- Maybe it's here.
- I looked in there already.

203
00:15:17,822 --> 00:15:19,957
- Find it?
- She must've had it on her.

204
00:15:19,991 --> 00:15:22,961
It's ours! Go back
and get it from the old hag!

205
00:15:23,027 --> 00:15:27,332
Yeah, right. We go and say, "Excuse me.
We left money on our dead baby-sitter."

206
00:15:27,432 --> 00:15:29,601
No way.

207
00:15:29,668 --> 00:15:32,671
- Who's gonna clean this place up?
- Not me.

208
00:15:35,174 --> 00:15:38,711
What are we gonna do for cash
for the next two months?

209
00:15:38,778 --> 00:15:40,747
How about a garage sale?

210
00:15:40,813 --> 00:15:43,850
- We live in the boonies.
- How about calling Dad?

211
00:15:43,951 --> 00:15:47,388
- Dad doesn't care.
- What about blackmailing Dad?

212
00:15:47,454 --> 00:15:49,557
What about donating blood?
They pay you.

213
00:15:49,623 --> 00:15:51,291
You have to be over 1 8.

214
00:15:51,392 --> 00:15:53,694
There goes our great summer.

215
00:15:56,697 --> 00:15:58,199
Hello?

216
00:15:59,233 --> 00:16:00,702
Mom.

217
00:16:00,802 --> 00:16:02,403
Hi, Mom.

218
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:04,940
How's Australia?

219
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,476
Really? Great.

220
00:16:07,542 --> 00:16:10,613
Yeah, they're fine.
Everything's fine.

221
00:16:10,713 --> 00:16:12,581
Oh, Mrs. Sturak?

222
00:16:13,683 --> 00:16:16,886
Well, she's not here right now.

223
00:16:16,953 --> 00:16:18,454
She had a date.

224
00:16:18,554 --> 00:16:20,923
Some guy.
A mortician.

225
00:16:20,957 --> 00:16:24,360
Relax. I'm looking after things while
she's gone. Everything's gonna be fine.

226
00:16:24,428 --> 00:16:26,663
I love you too.
Okay.

227
00:16:26,763 --> 00:16:28,666
All right, bye.

228
00:16:30,868 --> 00:16:34,639
- You only got one bag of chips.
- We could only afford the necessities.

229
00:16:34,705 --> 00:16:38,042
This place is a crock.
We're never gonna make it two months.

230
00:16:38,076 --> 00:16:40,245
Man, I'm gonna
hole up at Lizard's.

231
00:16:40,278 --> 00:16:43,815
That's real brotherly.
Don't you have any pride?

232
00:16:45,116 --> 00:16:48,220
When our food's gone,
we can eat Elvis.

233
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,922
What do you want from me?

234
00:16:49,988 --> 00:16:52,524
Would you like me to call Mom back?
'Cause I can.

235
00:16:53,359 --> 00:16:54,994
Want to call Aunt Pat...

236
00:16:55,061 --> 00:16:56,996
or go crawling to one of
Mom's semi-wretched friends?

237
00:16:58,898 --> 00:17:00,667
We don't need a warden.

238
00:17:00,767 --> 00:17:04,805
We don't need an adult around telling us
when to eat, sleep and vacuum, right?

239
00:17:04,871 --> 00:17:07,441
We could have a great summer.
We just gotta stick together.

240
00:17:07,507 --> 00:17:10,010
- Okay, yeah.
- Totally.

241
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,881
Well, one of us
has to get a job.

242
00:17:13,948 --> 00:17:15,449
I'm not gonna.

243
00:17:15,516 --> 00:17:19,120
We don't have any choice.
We'll flip for it.

244
00:17:21,122 --> 00:17:23,358
Mama Celeste face up,
I go to work.

245
00:17:23,425 --> 00:17:27,996
Mama Celeste face down, you're sellin'
carnations on a freeway off-ramp.

246
00:17:33,002 --> 00:17:36,372
Okay, I'll get a job.
But you gotta stay and watch the kids.

247
00:17:36,438 --> 00:17:39,843
Hey, no problem, twisted sister.

248
00:17:39,909 --> 00:17:41,844
I can get a job
at a clothing store.

249
00:17:41,912 --> 00:17:43,981
They'll hire me in a second.
It'll be great.

250
00:18:00,164 --> 00:18:03,001
You gotta squeeze the fat
out of those burgers better.

251
00:18:05,403 --> 00:18:07,306
You're gettin' the hang of it.

252
00:18:12,678 --> 00:18:13,846
I'm Bryan.

253
00:18:15,081 --> 00:18:17,183
Swell, remember.

254
00:18:17,283 --> 00:18:19,285
Put on a happy face.

255
00:18:22,189 --> 00:18:24,157
Did he just finish
reading Dianetics?

256
00:18:24,224 --> 00:18:26,493
- No. He's just on helium.
- Bryan.

257
00:18:27,695 --> 00:18:29,597
Another happy delivery.

258
00:18:31,999 --> 00:18:36,003
You gotta put chili on those Clown Dogs,
and keep it movin'.

259
00:18:49,852 --> 00:18:52,554
This is great, man.
My sister's working.

260
00:18:52,654 --> 00:18:54,657
There's no one around
nagging me anymore.

261
00:18:54,691 --> 00:18:57,226
- I'm born free.
- Hey, dude.

262
00:18:57,327 --> 00:19:00,730
- Let's go to the Guitar Center.
- Wait, guys.

263
00:19:00,797 --> 00:19:03,767
We seem to be experiencing
a negative cash-flow problem here.

264
00:19:03,834 --> 00:19:07,571
Let's go to my place.
I'll rip off my mom's MasterCard again.

265
00:19:07,637 --> 00:19:10,141
Master the possibilities.

266
00:19:11,008 --> 00:19:12,510
I gotta get out of here.

267
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:17,215
My dad is pissed about my report card.
I gotta kiss ass a couple more days.

268
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:21,253
You know what, guys?

269
00:19:21,286 --> 00:19:25,591
We keep this up, we're never
gettin' out of school, man.

270
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:28,293
Far out!

271
00:19:29,462 --> 00:19:31,531
Rock and roll!

272
00:20:08,537 --> 00:20:10,639
- Thanks.
- Sure.

273
00:20:16,379 --> 00:20:20,817
- Did you have a lot of deliveries?
- Yeah. I'm the stork of fast food.

274
00:20:20,851 --> 00:20:23,821
You're lucky.
It's better than being here.

275
00:20:23,853 --> 00:20:25,556
Yeah, I guess.

276
00:20:33,297 --> 00:20:35,666
God, this place is so disgusting.

277
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:38,536
- How can you stand it?
- Just try to hang with it.

278
00:20:44,376 --> 00:20:46,145
Shit.

279
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:48,580
- Gross.
- Not your dream job, huh?

280
00:20:48,647 --> 00:20:51,484
You got that right.

281
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:53,485
You'd think I woke up
this morning and thought...

282
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:56,255
"Gee, I'd love to scrub fat vats.

283
00:20:56,322 --> 00:20:58,424
I'd love to smile
and work with raw meat."

284
00:20:58,491 --> 00:21:00,693
At least it gives you
some extra cash.

285
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,430
I'm not working at the big top from hell
for pocket money.

286
00:21:03,497 --> 00:21:06,133
My mom's out of town, and I have
my brothers and sister to feed.

287
00:21:06,199 --> 00:21:10,137
And no one's gonna hire a teenager
to do anything that isn't disgusting.

288
00:21:10,204 --> 00:21:12,640
Why can't I just get a job
at some nice, clean office?

289
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:14,142
Why don't you just quit?

290
00:21:16,411 --> 00:21:19,380
How's the scrubba-dub-dubbing going?

291
00:21:19,414 --> 00:21:21,683
You're almost
doing that correctly...

292
00:21:21,783 --> 00:21:24,386
but you forgot
one very big thing.

293
00:21:24,453 --> 00:21:27,055
- Not enough cleanser?
- Nope.

294
00:21:27,122 --> 00:21:29,524
Forgot to put on a happy face.

295
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:34,263
Next, you get to scrape the spitballs
off the drive-through window...

296
00:21:34,331 --> 00:21:37,067
with a really fun squeegee!

297
00:21:42,572 --> 00:21:44,007
Look, Mr. Egg.

298
00:21:44,107 --> 00:21:46,610
Finish the Happy Fat vats yourself.

299
00:21:52,817 --> 00:21:54,786
Thanks foryour advice.

300
00:21:54,819 --> 00:21:56,955
Maybe I'll see you around.

301
00:22:35,696 --> 00:22:38,433
You're just copying it
right out of the book?

302
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:43,272
I changed the name, and I'm adding
some glamorous fashion stuff.

303
00:23:37,831 --> 00:23:41,301
Spell that a little faster.
Your number?

304
00:23:41,401 --> 00:23:42,836
Excuse me.

305
00:23:42,869 --> 00:23:46,374
- I'm applying for the receptionist job.
- Hold.

306
00:23:46,474 --> 00:23:49,343
Reception.
I can't right now.

307
00:23:49,444 --> 00:23:52,280
I have to stay and redirect all the
incompetents who are coming up here...

308
00:23:52,313 --> 00:23:54,882
instead of going straight to Personnel
like they are supposed to.

309
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:58,453
All right, all right.
I'll be right there.

310
00:23:58,553 --> 00:24:00,989
You'll have about 1 2 seconds.

311
00:24:04,593 --> 00:24:08,564
You are supposed to go down
to Personnel.

312
00:24:08,597 --> 00:24:09,899
That is on...

313
00:24:09,999 --> 00:24:12,401
the first floor.

314
00:24:13,102 --> 00:24:16,439
There is a great big sign
that says...

315
00:24:17,908 --> 00:24:20,043
"Personnel."

316
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:21,645
Do you...

317
00:24:21,678 --> 00:24:24,348
understand?

318
00:24:31,822 --> 00:24:34,592
Where's Carolyn?
Mousy-brown hair, gives you a headache?

319
00:24:34,659 --> 00:24:37,762
- Talks like she's chewing her face?
- That's her.

320
00:24:37,829 --> 00:24:41,366
She'll be back in a few seconds.
I'm here for the receptionist job.

321
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,702
- Is this your résumé?
- Yeah.

322
00:24:49,008 --> 00:24:50,443
Wow.

323
00:24:50,476 --> 00:24:52,311
Very impressive.

324
00:24:53,379 --> 00:24:56,583
- This is fabulous.
- Thankyou.

325
00:24:58,118 --> 00:25:01,522
Listen. They're looking for
a receptionist to replace Carolyn.

326
00:25:01,555 --> 00:25:05,526
She's supposed to move up to be
my executive administrative assistant.

327
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:08,796
I can't stand her, so do me a favor.
You be my assistant.

328
00:25:08,863 --> 00:25:11,198
I'll just tell 'em
I hired outside the company.

329
00:25:11,266 --> 00:25:12,900
What about
the receptionist job?

330
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,571
What, are you burnt out?
You wanna take a step down?

331
00:25:16,638 --> 00:25:18,941
Well, I won't let you.
I need you.

332
00:25:19,041 --> 00:25:22,644
And besides, you're so overqualified
for entry level, it's ridiculous.

333
00:25:22,711 --> 00:25:25,548
For God's sakes,
you're a Vassar gal.

334
00:25:25,648 --> 00:25:28,651
And you'd much rather
be my executive assistant.

335
00:25:28,684 --> 00:25:30,419
Please say yes.

336
00:25:31,521 --> 00:25:32,889
Yes!

337
00:25:32,922 --> 00:25:34,991
We're up here with
the other vice presidents...

338
00:25:35,091 --> 00:25:37,060
our executive staff
and our advertising people.

339
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,862
Downstairs are the designers...

340
00:25:38,962 --> 00:25:41,631
our warehouse and showroom,
and our manufacturing and assembly line.

341
00:25:41,731 --> 00:25:44,601
You graduated six years ago,
so you're 27, 28?

342
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:46,770
- Yeah.
- You don't look it.

343
00:25:46,837 --> 00:25:50,608
My last assistant was only 23
and still wet behind the ears.

344
00:25:52,043 --> 00:25:54,879
Okay, this is your office.
Mine's through the archway.

345
00:25:54,946 --> 00:25:57,181
These are your things.
Your Rolodex.

346
00:25:57,282 --> 00:25:59,318
There's your computer,
WordStar and Lotus.

347
00:25:59,384 --> 00:26:01,887
There's your mouse.
The refrigerator's over there.

348
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:04,924
Just leave a list for Carolyn.
She'll stock it for you, okay?

349
00:26:04,957 --> 00:26:07,526
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, great.

350
00:26:07,593 --> 00:26:11,130
So, these are my things.
When do I get paid?

351
00:26:12,432 --> 00:26:15,368
First and fifteenth of every month.
Is that it?

352
00:26:16,236 --> 00:26:18,705
Great.
Gus, hi.

353
00:26:19,807 --> 00:26:22,209
This is my new administrative
assistant, Sue Ellen.

354
00:26:22,242 --> 00:26:25,813
Sue Ellen, this is Gus Brandon,
vice president of marketing.

355
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:28,850
- And he serves me breakfast in bed.
- Only when she deserves it.

356
00:26:30,017 --> 00:26:31,920
- Nice to meet you.
- Good morning.

357
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:35,290
- See you for lunch?
- I'll let you know.

358
00:26:35,357 --> 00:26:38,560
I'm interfacing with New York at 3:00,
and I have a report due today.

359
00:26:38,627 --> 00:26:40,162
We'll play it by ear.

360
00:26:40,228 --> 00:26:41,830
Talk to you later.

361
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:44,800
Bye.
Sue Ellen, right?

362
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,578
Have a great weekend.
See you Monday, 8:00 sharp.

363
00:26:57,847 --> 00:27:01,251
By the way, I'm Rose Lindsey,
senior vice president of operations.

364
00:27:01,318 --> 00:27:05,089
And when Beatrice from Personnel calls,
she's a really pushy broad.

365
00:27:05,155 --> 00:27:09,594
Just tell her I hired you. And find out
about your medical benefits and pension.

366
00:27:09,694 --> 00:27:13,331
Oh, one more thing,
and this is so important.

367
00:27:13,398 --> 00:27:16,501
Whenever we're not alone or I'm
on the phone and I askyou something--

368
00:27:16,568 --> 00:27:19,872
doesn't matter what it is--
you always say...

369
00:27:19,972 --> 00:27:22,774
"I'm right on top of that, Rose."

370
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:27,046
- Welcome aboard, sweetie.
- Thankyou.

371
00:27:37,657 --> 00:27:39,259
I'm gonna get you, sucker!

372
00:27:45,933 --> 00:27:47,635
I need more money.

373
00:27:48,736 --> 00:27:50,672
Get out of here.

374
00:27:50,772 --> 00:27:53,207
Anyway, I have my own office...

375
00:27:53,274 --> 00:27:56,612
and this fridge stocked with Diet Sprite
and Tab, and I have a great view.

376
00:27:56,678 --> 00:27:58,012
What's the job?

377
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,850
I am the executive
administrative assistant...

378
00:28:00,916 --> 00:28:03,252
to the senior vice president
of operations.

379
00:28:03,319 --> 00:28:06,021
- What the hell is that?
- I don't know.

380
00:28:06,088 --> 00:28:07,690
What are they gonna pay you?

381
00:28:07,757 --> 00:28:10,994
$37,500 a year.

382
00:28:11,094 --> 00:28:12,662
No way!

383
00:28:12,729 --> 00:28:15,999
Shit! You're gonna drown! Choke!

384
00:28:16,099 --> 00:28:18,835
I'm a fast learner.
I'll catch on.

385
00:28:18,936 --> 00:28:20,504
You're never gonna
get to the beach.

386
00:28:20,538 --> 00:28:23,574
Yeah, but who cares?
I'm a career woman now.

387
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:27,645
Better bring some bucks home tomorrow
'cause we're totally out of food.

388
00:28:27,745 --> 00:28:30,582
Wait a minute.
I don't get paid for two weeks.

389
00:28:30,614 --> 00:28:34,452
Help. We need money.
We have no food.

390
00:28:34,519 --> 00:28:37,021
- Are those drag queens?
- What's a drag queen?

391
00:28:37,089 --> 00:28:39,090
- That's our car!
- Let's go!

392
00:28:40,692 --> 00:28:43,062
What are you queens
doin' in our car?

393
00:28:44,964 --> 00:28:46,733
Step on it!

394
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:48,201
Liza?

395
00:28:57,077 --> 00:28:59,346
Shit! I loved that car.

396
00:28:59,413 --> 00:29:00,747
Call the cops.

397
00:29:00,781 --> 00:29:03,350
What are we gonna say?
Liza Minnelli stole our Buick?

398
00:29:03,417 --> 00:29:05,853
- It wasn't even our Buick.
- This sucks.

399
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:08,622
- Now how are we gonna get home?
- I miss Mommy.

400
00:29:12,293 --> 00:29:15,664
- Call Nicole.
- All of my friends are in Europe.

401
00:29:17,132 --> 00:29:20,269
- What about Lizard or Hellhound?
- We don't have any money.

402
00:29:20,335 --> 00:29:22,872
- You'd have to bribe them?
- Yeah.

403
00:29:23,839 --> 00:29:25,774
Who else do you know that drives?

404
00:29:42,826 --> 00:29:44,862
Who's the bozo?

405
00:29:46,130 --> 00:29:48,967
Hi. Thanks for coming.

406
00:29:49,067 --> 00:29:52,370
No problem.
I kind of like being a hero.

407
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:54,906
Me and my trusty steed.

408
00:29:56,975 --> 00:29:59,778
Just get in the car.
Come on. Come on.

409
00:30:07,387 --> 00:30:10,724
My mom doesn't want us
to use her Volvo while she's away.

410
00:30:10,824 --> 00:30:12,625
Can't believe my friends
ditched us like that.

411
00:30:12,692 --> 00:30:16,496
But wasn't that your car I saw
at Clown Dog? Whitewalls and stuff?

412
00:30:16,596 --> 00:30:18,932
Yeah, well,
it was kind of a loaner.

413
00:30:19,032 --> 00:30:21,501
Swell, what are you doing?
Come on!

414
00:30:21,569 --> 00:30:24,005
Hold on.
I'll be there in a minute.

415
00:30:25,539 --> 00:30:28,676
I'm sorry if I acted like a bitch
the other night at Clown Dog...

416
00:30:28,709 --> 00:30:30,645
just walking out like that.

417
00:30:30,745 --> 00:30:33,314
- It cracked Mr. Egg when you left.
- Really?

418
00:30:33,348 --> 00:30:35,350
Did you get stuck
finishing the fat vats?

419
00:30:35,383 --> 00:30:37,652
Lard is my life.

420
00:30:37,752 --> 00:30:40,589
At least until college.

421
00:30:40,622 --> 00:30:43,158
- I'm glad you called, really.
- Yeah, me too.

422
00:30:43,226 --> 00:30:44,860
Could you hurry up?

423
00:30:44,927 --> 00:30:48,731
Melissa and Zach are beating
each other up over the last Sno Ball.

424
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:50,733
It's the last food we got.

425
00:30:51,934 --> 00:30:54,471
- You guys really out of food?
- No.

426
00:30:54,538 --> 00:30:57,308
They're just being obnoxious.
I'm going to the market in the morning.

427
00:30:57,374 --> 00:31:01,512
I've got some extra leftovers from my
dinner deliveries, so ifyou want 'em--

428
00:31:02,813 --> 00:31:04,915
No, that's okay.

429
00:31:07,352 --> 00:31:09,754
Maybe we'll take 'em.
Thanks.

430
00:31:09,787 --> 00:31:10,755
Sure.

431
00:31:11,956 --> 00:31:14,392
You wanna go to the beach
and watch the grunion run Monday night?

432
00:31:14,426 --> 00:31:16,161
You mean, a date?

433
00:31:17,128 --> 00:31:20,699
Yeah. I'm free.
I gotta check with the grunion, but--

434
00:31:22,034 --> 00:31:23,469
Yeah, a date.

435
00:31:23,535 --> 00:31:25,872
Yeah, sure.
I like grunion.

436
00:31:25,938 --> 00:31:27,040
Me too.

437
00:31:27,106 --> 00:31:29,242
Thanks again.

438
00:31:29,275 --> 00:31:30,910
Bye.

439
00:31:32,812 --> 00:31:35,949
We have unhealthful air. quality today
thr.oughout the LosAngeles basin.

440
00:31:36,016 --> 00:31:40,187
KDJI news time is 5:30 A.M.,
and ifthis isyour. wake-up call...

441
00:31:40,254 --> 00:31:41,789
wake up!

442
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:12,589
- You guys are up already?
- It's summer.

443
00:32:12,656 --> 00:32:14,357
- I'm a morning person.
- I'm hungry.

444
00:32:14,425 --> 00:32:16,526
What do you guys
want for breakfast?

445
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,395
- A steak.
- Cheese omelet.

446
00:32:18,462 --> 00:32:20,798
- SpaghettiOs.
- Okay.

447
00:32:31,042 --> 00:32:32,944
Breakfast is served.

448
00:32:51,598 --> 00:32:53,566
Excuse me.
Where do you think you're going?

449
00:32:55,435 --> 00:32:58,472
To Rose Lindsey's office.
I work for her now.

450
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,008
You?

451
00:33:01,075 --> 00:33:02,710
Hi. I'm Sue Ellen.

452
00:33:05,079 --> 00:33:08,083
Well, don't bother
getting too settled in, hmm?

453
00:33:12,521 --> 00:33:16,325
Yes, we have temporarily cut back
on quality fabrics...

454
00:33:16,391 --> 00:33:18,794
due to a receding profit margin.

455
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:22,064
I understand. Anytime you
want to come back to G.A.W.

456
00:33:22,798 --> 00:33:25,101
Thankyou for
telling me personally.

457
00:33:25,201 --> 00:33:28,371
Bye-bye. Would you all
please excuse us for a minute?

458
00:33:28,404 --> 00:33:30,340
- Sure, Rose.
- Fabulous.

459
00:33:32,041 --> 00:33:35,746
Oh, Lord.
We just lost another account.

460
00:33:35,846 --> 00:33:38,448
Costs are up, overhead is high,
sales are down.

461
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:42,987
New York's gonna be none too thrilled
with their industrial uniform division.

462
00:33:43,721 --> 00:33:46,391
This is our new spring line.

463
00:33:46,491 --> 00:33:49,293
- Lovely, isn't it?
- Yeah, lovely.

464
00:33:49,327 --> 00:33:52,197
You know, I thought
we made designer clothes.

465
00:33:53,632 --> 00:33:55,567
Sue Ellen, no.

466
00:33:55,634 --> 00:33:58,370
We're in the bowels
of the fashion industry.

467
00:33:58,404 --> 00:34:02,608
General Apparel West is one of
32 subdivisions of ChemTech America...

468
00:34:02,675 --> 00:34:04,743
one of our nation's
leading chemical corporations.

469
00:34:04,844 --> 00:34:07,347
This is our design area...

470
00:34:07,447 --> 00:34:11,318
and this is Franklin,
our head designer.

471
00:34:12,586 --> 00:34:14,855
You'll be verifying his purchase orders
pending my approval...

472
00:34:14,888 --> 00:34:16,857
and consulting with him
on budget estimates.

473
00:34:17,691 --> 00:34:20,294
- Bye, Franklin.
- Bye.

474
00:34:20,361 --> 00:34:23,831
You'll also be coordinating our sales,
manufacturing and advertising people.

475
00:34:23,931 --> 00:34:25,833
I'm gonna need
biweekly reports from you.

476
00:34:25,933 --> 00:34:28,336
Basically, you're the hub
of our communication network.

477
00:34:28,369 --> 00:34:29,338
Hub.

478
00:34:37,513 --> 00:34:40,215
- I hate you.
- Sue Ellen?

479
00:34:40,282 --> 00:34:43,652
Start getting updated reports from the
department heads and coordinating them.

480
00:34:43,686 --> 00:34:46,256
You can access the format
on the C-drive.

481
00:34:46,322 --> 00:34:49,526
Until you lay it out on a spreadsheet,
the market analysis is too amorphous.

482
00:34:50,927 --> 00:34:54,732
The Q.E.D. report. I've made notes.
See ifyou can make a dent after lunch.

483
00:34:54,764 --> 00:34:58,402
And fax this to New York for me.
Don't feel overwhelmed.

484
00:34:58,469 --> 00:35:00,404
Just do one thing at a time.

485
00:35:07,812 --> 00:35:09,781
Looking for something,
Sue Ellen?

486
00:35:09,815 --> 00:35:13,619
Yeah.
Where did that come from?

487
00:35:13,652 --> 00:35:15,921
I had it delivered.
Do you have a problem with that?

488
00:35:16,021 --> 00:35:19,659
No. I was just wondering why they would
come all this way to bring a chili dog.

489
00:35:19,725 --> 00:35:22,261
My little brother
drives the delivery van.

490
00:35:22,328 --> 00:35:24,330
Occasionally...

491
00:35:24,364 --> 00:35:27,734
he goes out of his way
to bring me lunch, all right?

492
00:35:27,767 --> 00:35:30,671
That's nice.
Your little brother.

493
00:35:31,872 --> 00:35:34,007
I need to fax something.
How would I do that?

494
00:35:34,074 --> 00:35:35,642
Gosh, Sue Ellen.

495
00:35:35,742 --> 00:35:39,713
Being an executive administrative
assistant, you can figure that out.

496
00:35:57,132 --> 00:35:58,634
Hello?

497
00:36:06,676 --> 00:36:08,444
Hi. Are you a temp?

498
00:36:08,545 --> 00:36:11,981
No. I'm Sue Ellen.
I work for Rose.

499
00:36:12,049 --> 00:36:14,018
Hi. I'm Cathy.

500
00:36:14,050 --> 00:36:17,054
So you're Rose's new
executive administrative assistant.

501
00:36:17,121 --> 00:36:19,924
Well, congratulations.

502
00:36:20,024 --> 00:36:22,260
I submitted my résumé,
but it wasn't good enough.

503
00:36:22,326 --> 00:36:25,396
Wow. Working with Rose
must be so neat.

504
00:36:25,496 --> 00:36:28,166
Am I cutting in front ofyou?
Are you faxing?

505
00:36:28,266 --> 00:36:31,770
No, I'm still organizing
my spreadsheet...

506
00:36:31,837 --> 00:36:34,840
and my projections--
amorphous hub stuff.

507
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:36,909
Oh, right.

508
00:36:45,251 --> 00:36:48,788
So anyway, I'm Fred Kibrick's
secretary over in sales.

509
00:36:48,855 --> 00:36:50,824
It has been really slow.

510
00:36:50,857 --> 00:36:55,028
- Gosh! You're swamped!
- Yeah.

511
00:36:55,095 --> 00:36:57,064
I'm a whiz on the computer...

512
00:36:57,131 --> 00:36:59,700
so ifyou ever have
anything for me, just ask.

513
00:36:59,767 --> 00:37:03,504
Ifyou want-- Are you familiar
with the Q.E.D. report?

514
00:37:04,405 --> 00:37:06,574
Oh, wow.
Really?

515
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:10,546
- Yeah, go ahead, really.
- Thankyou.

516
00:37:13,749 --> 00:37:16,685
Oh, and don't feel overwhelmed.
Just do one thing at a time.

517
00:37:16,785 --> 00:37:17,786
Right.

518
00:37:27,264 --> 00:37:29,265
- Hello?
- How's it goin'?

519
00:37:29,332 --> 00:37:31,001
What do you mean?

520
00:37:31,101 --> 00:37:33,070
How ar.eyou?
Ar.e the kids okay?

521
00:37:33,136 --> 00:37:37,041
No. I tied 'em to a red-ant hill.
Did you get some money?

522
00:37:37,141 --> 00:37:40,745
Hey, who are you?
Where's that other broad, Mona?

523
00:37:40,811 --> 00:37:42,747
Not yet.
There's a problem.

524
00:37:42,814 --> 00:37:44,782
What'd they do? Fire you?

525
00:37:44,849 --> 00:37:47,218
I'm Sue Ellen. I work for Rose.
Can I help you?

526
00:37:47,285 --> 00:37:49,621
I need a copy of
the Bob's Big Boy account figures.

527
00:37:49,688 --> 00:37:52,624
What ar.eyou gonna do?
This Clown Dog shit's gone, man.

528
00:37:52,691 --> 00:37:56,028
What do you want me to do?
We have a receding profit margin.

529
00:37:56,095 --> 00:37:58,063
Yo, Gidget,
could you get on it?

530
00:37:58,097 --> 00:38:00,567
I can't right now.
I'm on an important phone call.

531
00:38:00,667 --> 00:38:02,668
Ifyou didn't get the money,
why'd you call?

532
00:38:02,702 --> 00:38:05,705
Hey, look.
I don't have all day.

533
00:38:05,738 --> 00:38:06,806
Hold on.

534
00:38:08,274 --> 00:38:10,277
What is your name,
and what do you do here?

535
00:38:10,343 --> 00:38:13,914
I'm Bruce.
I'm head inventory clerk. Why?

536
00:38:13,948 --> 00:38:17,885
Well, Bruce, I'm the executive level
administrative assistant...

537
00:38:17,985 --> 00:38:20,955
and when I get those figures ready,
I'll give you a buzz...

538
00:38:20,988 --> 00:38:23,792
and you can run up here
and fetch them, all right?

539
00:38:25,727 --> 00:38:27,662
Yeah, sure.

540
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:30,732
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

541
00:38:33,435 --> 00:38:36,672
- I just called to say hi.
- Aren't you busy in your career?

542
00:38:36,738 --> 00:38:40,810
I'm in between important meetings.
I'm so sorry I disturbed you, Kenny.

543
00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:42,612
You did. We're busy.

544
00:38:42,712 --> 00:38:45,248
- Fine! Screw you!
- Up yours!

545
00:38:46,850 --> 00:38:48,318
Bitch.

546
00:38:48,351 --> 00:38:49,853
Such a punk.

547
00:38:54,191 --> 00:38:55,859
What?

548
00:38:58,929 --> 00:39:01,599
How you doin', Mom? Yeah.

549
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:03,901
No, everything's great.

550
00:39:03,968 --> 00:39:07,372
No, Mrs. Sturak's not here. She--

551
00:39:07,472 --> 00:39:09,274
She went to the yarn store.

552
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:12,411
Yeah, she's crocheting this
massive doily for the couch.

553
00:39:14,546 --> 00:39:17,816
I-- I gotta go, Mom.

554
00:39:19,652 --> 00:39:22,922
Hey, babe.
Who's the void in Lindsey's office?

555
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:26,292
She applied for
the receptionist job.

556
00:39:26,392 --> 00:39:30,197
Suddenly she's an executive?
I don't get it.

557
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:31,932
- Ready.
- Genie.

558
00:39:32,032 --> 00:39:34,001
- Wher.eyou par.kyour. car..
- Gar.age?

559
00:39:34,067 --> 00:39:36,203
-A hor.se r.uns at a--
- Gallop.

560
00:39:36,270 --> 00:39:39,841
- You go to the super.mar.ket--
- Groceries.

561
00:39:39,907 --> 00:39:43,478
- Do you ever go outside?
- Nah. No TV.

562
00:39:43,545 --> 00:39:45,279
No prizes.

563
00:39:45,347 --> 00:39:48,283
All r.ight.
Gentlemen, you've got it.

564
00:39:48,316 --> 00:39:49,818
Who do not want--

565
00:39:49,918 --> 00:39:51,520
When you'r.e gonna do a cake...

566
00:39:51,586 --> 00:39:54,190
you r.eally have to have
a battle plan all r.eady...

567
00:39:54,256 --> 00:39:57,960
so that when you start in,
you can just go r.ight thr.ough the cake.

568
00:39:57,993 --> 00:40:01,164
You don 't wanna go out and play cr.oquet
in the middle, for. instance.

569
00:40:01,998 --> 00:40:05,135
I'll give her the message.
Bye.

570
00:40:05,235 --> 00:40:07,204
Cathy, thank you so much.

571
00:40:07,237 --> 00:40:10,774
No, Sue Ellen.
Thank you. Really.

572
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:17,314
Why don't you call Siam Mania
and order in lunch for us.

573
00:40:17,381 --> 00:40:20,485
- The naked shrimp is to die from.
- Right. Yum.

574
00:40:20,551 --> 00:40:22,520
They'll deliver.
Pay out of petty cash.

575
00:40:22,554 --> 00:40:26,558
- Petty cash?
- Cash box is in your locked drawer.

576
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:28,560
There should be plenty.

577
00:40:28,627 --> 00:40:31,263
You can cash personal checks
for our employees.

578
00:40:31,363 --> 00:40:35,868
We work such hellish hours here,
no one has time to go to the bank.

579
00:40:35,968 --> 00:40:38,805
Guard it with your life, and leave
receipts for whateveryou take.

580
00:40:38,871 --> 00:40:41,006
I'll authorize it, okay?

581
00:40:42,041 --> 00:40:43,776
Is this for me?

582
00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:51,218
This is exquisite.

583
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:53,888
We're so in sync.

584
00:41:41,439 --> 00:41:43,708
- Hi, Zach.
- Hi.

585
00:41:47,078 --> 00:41:48,847
What's wrong?

586
00:41:48,914 --> 00:41:51,350
Me and Cynthia
are having some problems.

587
00:41:52,551 --> 00:41:54,854
I think she likes Jacob better.

588
00:41:54,887 --> 00:41:56,889
Maybe she's trying
to make you jealous.

589
00:41:56,922 --> 00:41:58,491
Maybe.

590
00:41:59,559 --> 00:42:01,294
Oh, here.

591
00:42:01,327 --> 00:42:03,629
There's an article on game playing.

592
00:42:03,729 --> 00:42:06,199
I really think
you should read it.

593
00:42:06,266 --> 00:42:09,136
Take the quiz afterward, okay?

594
00:42:09,169 --> 00:42:11,705
Check it out.
Elvis, I'm gonna take you higher.

595
00:42:33,729 --> 00:42:36,031
Look at his eyes.
Poor dude.

596
00:42:39,168 --> 00:42:41,137
Kenny, could you
turn the music down?

597
00:42:41,170 --> 00:42:43,339
- Kenny.
- What?

598
00:42:44,807 --> 00:42:47,210
I have been working.
I've had a very rough day.

599
00:42:47,277 --> 00:42:51,014
- Could you turn the music down?
- It's down, cave lady.

600
00:42:53,250 --> 00:42:56,053
Kenny, why don't you save
your last three brain cells?

601
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:58,456
- What ifyou need them?
- I won't.

602
00:43:01,159 --> 00:43:03,495
That's right.
You'll never need them.

603
00:43:03,528 --> 00:43:07,299
There's always gonna be some jerk around
stupid enough to take care ofyou.

604
00:43:07,332 --> 00:43:10,302
- What is your problem?
- Yeah.

605
00:43:10,369 --> 00:43:12,371
You couldn't even
mow the lawn today.

606
00:43:12,438 --> 00:43:14,339
You're worthless.

607
00:43:14,373 --> 00:43:18,377
I am doing everything,
and I'm trying to get ready for a date.

608
00:43:18,445 --> 00:43:22,182
When are you gonna start helping me,
you lazy little punk?

609
00:43:25,419 --> 00:43:27,754
P.M.S. City, man.

610
00:43:51,714 --> 00:43:53,983
God, that's cold!

611
00:43:54,049 --> 00:43:56,886
So, Bryan,
when do the grunion run?

612
00:43:56,986 --> 00:43:58,554
Right about now.

613
00:43:58,654 --> 00:44:02,291
They get washed up here on the shore
after the highest tide of the full moon.

614
00:44:02,359 --> 00:44:04,560
Or the new moon.

615
00:44:04,661 --> 00:44:08,465
Anyway, the girl grunion,
she comes and lays her eggs in the sand.

616
00:44:08,498 --> 00:44:10,534
Then the guy grunion comes
and fertilizes them.

617
00:44:10,601 --> 00:44:13,771
So they don't, like,
do it together?

618
00:44:14,538 --> 00:44:16,107
Not like us.

619
00:44:19,878 --> 00:44:22,347
- I mean, like humans.
- Oh.

620
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:25,183
You wanna go and watch for 'em?
It happens really fast.

621
00:44:25,217 --> 00:44:26,618
Sure.

622
00:44:26,718 --> 00:44:29,655
You goin' to college?
What do you wanna do?

623
00:44:29,722 --> 00:44:32,358
Oh, God.
I don't know.

624
00:44:32,458 --> 00:44:35,061
I'm supposed to register
at City College.

625
00:44:35,127 --> 00:44:38,698
You know, maybe take some
fashion design classes or something.

626
00:44:38,765 --> 00:44:42,101
- What about you?
- My parents want me to go to UCSD.

627
00:44:42,168 --> 00:44:44,504
They have a really good
oceanography program there.

628
00:44:44,571 --> 00:44:47,841
- That's cool.
- Yeah, but I'm not so sure.

629
00:44:47,941 --> 00:44:50,878
I figure I'll keep
savin' up for it anyway.

630
00:44:50,978 --> 00:44:54,782
That's the only reason I'm still
at Clown Dog after nine months.

631
00:44:54,849 --> 00:44:56,250
It's funny.

632
00:44:56,350 --> 00:45:00,188
I always thought that my parents
had this big college fund for me.

633
00:45:00,221 --> 00:45:02,224
Yeah, me too.

634
00:45:02,257 --> 00:45:05,294
But I guess that's only on
the savings and loan commercials.

635
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:08,763
It's like, I don't know if
I want oceanography to be my life.

636
00:45:08,864 --> 00:45:11,601
I mean, I love it.
Love it.

637
00:45:11,701 --> 00:45:14,270
But it's like once you decide
on something, it's all planned out.

638
00:45:14,337 --> 00:45:19,308
It's like all of a sudden,
anything you do means that's your life.

639
00:45:19,342 --> 00:45:21,311
I'm not sure what
I want my life to be yet.

640
00:45:21,344 --> 00:45:24,447
And then you're stuck in this plan
because you decided, you know?

641
00:45:24,547 --> 00:45:26,983
And then you're old or older.

642
00:45:27,017 --> 00:45:29,787
I don't know.
I guess I'm just stalling.

643
00:45:34,826 --> 00:45:35,727
What?

644
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:40,231
Nothing.
I just know what you mean.

645
00:45:42,133 --> 00:45:43,802
This is always--

646
00:45:43,902 --> 00:45:46,871
Yeah. I hate this part.

647
00:45:46,905 --> 00:45:51,143
I mean, I like this part, but--
Oh, God.

648
00:45:51,209 --> 00:45:53,813
It's okay. Come here.

649
00:45:57,684 --> 00:46:00,186
Forget it.
I ruined the moment.

650
00:46:00,220 --> 00:46:02,489
No, I ruined it
because I talked about it.

651
00:46:02,589 --> 00:46:06,326
When you talk, you ruin it.
You can't talk unless you stop.

652
00:46:31,254 --> 00:46:32,955
Kenny, wake up.

653
00:46:32,988 --> 00:46:35,424
The food that I bought yesterday
is already gone.

654
00:46:35,491 --> 00:46:39,896
I was entertaining some friends
last night, and we had the munchies.

655
00:46:39,996 --> 00:46:42,532
I am not working
to feed your scummy friends.

656
00:46:42,632 --> 00:46:44,735
You're a career woman now.

657
00:46:44,835 --> 00:46:48,839
- We can afford to be hospitable.
- Whatever. Here.

658
00:46:48,906 --> 00:46:52,410
- Go buy some more food for the kids.
- You got paid!

659
00:46:52,510 --> 00:46:56,113
Well, not exactly.
It's office money, petty cash.

660
00:46:56,181 --> 00:46:59,650
My paycheck's gonna be over $1,000.
I'll be able to put it back.

661
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:01,386
I gotta go.

662
00:47:02,988 --> 00:47:05,457
And I don't want your friends
hanging around my house.

663
00:47:05,557 --> 00:47:08,560
Mow the lawn today,
and don't forget the dishes. Bye.

664
00:47:11,663 --> 00:47:13,399
I'll do the dishes.

665
00:47:17,036 --> 00:47:19,138
- Yes, Scott!
- One more.

666
00:47:22,075 --> 00:47:24,211
- Pull!
- There!

667
00:47:25,345 --> 00:47:26,980
Dishes are done, man.

668
00:47:27,081 --> 00:47:28,983
Cleans 'em down to a shine.

669
00:47:37,992 --> 00:47:40,061
- Hi, Franklin.
- Hi.

670
00:47:40,161 --> 00:47:43,565
Sue Ellen, I need
to get this P.O. approved.

671
00:47:43,598 --> 00:47:47,002
- I got a good deal on some material.
- Good.

672
00:47:53,242 --> 00:47:56,379
I was just gonna see if Rose wanted
to grab some lunch in the cafeteria.

673
00:47:56,479 --> 00:47:59,916
Well, you just missed her.
Sorry.

674
00:48:02,419 --> 00:48:03,720
Hungry?

675
00:48:12,797 --> 00:48:14,799
- Good afternoon.
- Thankyou.

676
00:48:24,676 --> 00:48:27,079
Thankyou.

677
00:48:27,112 --> 00:48:30,148
So, how long have you
and Rose been together?

678
00:48:30,249 --> 00:48:33,086
We're not really together.
A few months.

679
00:48:33,118 --> 00:48:35,888
We agreed we're not exclusive.

680
00:48:35,922 --> 00:48:38,024
I date other women.

681
00:48:38,124 --> 00:48:40,793
Dinner, movies,
jazz clubs, the symphony.

682
00:48:40,861 --> 00:48:44,498
- You like classical music?
- I played cello in high school.

683
00:48:50,004 --> 00:48:52,106
Do people always tell you
how young you look?

684
00:48:52,206 --> 00:48:54,408
No, not usually.

685
00:48:54,475 --> 00:48:57,278
I'd ask how old you are,
but most women don't really like that.

686
00:48:57,345 --> 00:49:00,181
- No, we don't.
- It baffles me.

687
00:49:00,281 --> 00:49:02,183
A woman gets older...

688
00:49:02,284 --> 00:49:06,155
she matures, she ripens.

689
00:49:06,221 --> 00:49:09,358
Juices start flowing.
What's to hide?

690
00:49:09,425 --> 00:49:13,396
- Would you like something from the bar?
- Have a drink.

691
00:49:13,463 --> 00:49:15,398
It's a special occasion.

692
00:49:15,464 --> 00:49:19,669
All right. I'd like
a Martini & Rossi on the rocks.

693
00:49:19,769 --> 00:49:22,372
Ah, yes.
Sweet or dry?

694
00:49:23,307 --> 00:49:25,843
- What?
- Sweet or dry?

695
00:49:25,909 --> 00:49:28,545
Um, just a little bit of both.

696
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:33,584
- And foryou, sir?
- White wine spritzer.

697
00:49:37,922 --> 00:49:41,827
- What's the special occasion?
- It's our first lunch together.

698
00:49:43,528 --> 00:49:48,367
This'll give us a chance to break down
some of those corporate barriers.

699
00:49:48,401 --> 00:49:51,571
By the end of lunch, we'll probably
be sharing our intimate histories...

700
00:49:51,637 --> 00:49:54,240
stories of our first time.

701
00:49:54,307 --> 00:49:57,109
Next thing you know we'll be sharing
a cigarette in postcoital bliss.

702
00:49:57,210 --> 00:49:58,711
Are you talking about
us having sex?

703
00:49:58,812 --> 00:50:01,415
Hey, slow down.
You're moving too fast for me.

704
00:50:01,481 --> 00:50:03,450
But if that interests you,
it can be arranged.

705
00:50:03,484 --> 00:50:06,653
And if it doesn't,
I was kidding.

706
00:50:06,687 --> 00:50:10,624
Rosemary chicken's delicious here.
Very tender.

707
00:50:17,933 --> 00:50:20,135
Well, thankyou for lunch.

708
00:50:20,168 --> 00:50:21,736
Anytime.

709
00:50:29,211 --> 00:50:31,881
Now she's kissing up to Gus?

710
00:50:31,948 --> 00:50:35,085
I can't stand
that conniving little snot.

711
00:50:35,151 --> 00:50:36,819
Here's another one.

712
00:50:36,886 --> 00:50:39,355
In Minneapolis, an 1 1 th grader
beat up a schoolmate...

713
00:50:39,455 --> 00:50:42,892
over a rhinestone leather jacket
and a pair of Fiorucci jeans.

714
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:45,629
I just don't think that kids
are gonna want to wear uniforms.

715
00:50:45,730 --> 00:50:48,699
Don't you think that they're
kind of plain, kind of boring?

716
00:50:48,766 --> 00:50:52,536
Frankly, it's not up
to the students to decide.

717
00:50:52,604 --> 00:50:57,074
Next week I'll sit the superintendent
of schools down over eggs Florentine...

718
00:50:57,175 --> 00:51:00,112
and I'll convince him
that mandatory school uniforms...

719
00:51:00,212 --> 00:51:02,914
are necessary for the safety
of our schoolchildren.

720
00:51:03,015 --> 00:51:06,852
Not to mention boosting G.A.W. sales.
It'll be absolutely perfect.

721
00:51:06,919 --> 00:51:10,289
I don't know.
Kids like to wear stuff that's them.

722
00:51:10,356 --> 00:51:12,291
My high school
was like a fashion show.

723
00:51:12,358 --> 00:51:16,529
Back then it was safe.
But times, they are a-changin'.

724
00:51:16,596 --> 00:51:19,399
I guess you're right.
It was a long time ago.

725
00:51:19,499 --> 00:51:22,769
Let's stop. I'm exhausted,
and I'm late to meet Gus.

726
00:51:22,836 --> 00:51:25,873
What's the deal
with you and him?

727
00:51:26,874 --> 00:51:30,511
We've been mutually un-exclusive
for the last seven months.

728
00:51:30,611 --> 00:51:31,813
I brought up
the cohabitation topic recently.

729
00:51:31,813 --> 00:51:33,247
I brought up
the cohabitation topic recently.

730
00:51:33,314 --> 00:51:35,516
And we gave it
some serious thought.

731
00:51:35,617 --> 00:51:38,553
We decided it would be more
practical and convenient...

732
00:51:38,653 --> 00:51:41,923
ifwe maintained separate space.

733
00:51:42,024 --> 00:51:44,994
Which basically means
he isn't ready to commit.

734
00:51:45,094 --> 00:51:47,864
But they're all little boys
pretending to be men, right?

735
00:51:47,930 --> 00:51:50,333
All the guys that I've dated
have been boys.

736
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:52,969
Precisely.
The Peter Pan syndrome.

737
00:51:53,035 --> 00:51:56,339
God, I really need to get away.

738
00:51:57,140 --> 00:52:01,077
Gus has been trying to talk me into this
wild, dirty weekend in Santa Barbara...

739
00:52:01,177 --> 00:52:03,346
and I really wanna go.

740
00:52:03,414 --> 00:52:05,783
I don't want him to know that...

741
00:52:05,816 --> 00:52:07,818
so I haven't been
too enthusiastic about it.

742
00:52:07,885 --> 00:52:09,620
I know how that goes.

743
00:52:09,687 --> 00:52:14,059
But tonight, I think I'll stop
letting him try and persuade me.

744
00:52:14,125 --> 00:52:15,827
That'll do it.

745
00:52:17,262 --> 00:52:21,466
You go on home, have a glass ofwine,
and put cucumber slices on your eyes.

746
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:25,371
- You'll feel much better.
- Well, I'm all out of cucumbers.

747
00:52:25,437 --> 00:52:29,842
Sue Ellen, every girl over 25
should have a cucumber in their house.

748
00:52:38,518 --> 00:52:41,989
Remember these things?
They're great. Bounce with me.

749
00:52:42,022 --> 00:52:44,858
I feel stupid.
We are too old to bounce.

750
00:52:44,925 --> 00:52:47,228
Come on.
Bouncing is an ageless pastime.

751
00:52:48,095 --> 00:52:49,363
Come on.

752
00:52:49,463 --> 00:52:51,566
Would you feel more comfortable
if I started?

753
00:53:03,178 --> 00:53:04,546
Come on.

754
00:53:43,489 --> 00:53:45,424
Why'd you stop?

755
00:53:46,626 --> 00:53:48,327
Good moment.

756
00:53:52,465 --> 00:53:54,701
You're gonna have to
get off those things.

757
00:54:00,007 --> 00:54:02,943
There's a band playing
at Club Lago next week. Wanna go?

758
00:54:03,009 --> 00:54:05,446
- You have to be over 2 1.
- Yeah. Drag.

759
00:54:05,546 --> 00:54:08,115
Tomorrow I'm gonna go to the beach
with some buddies. Wanna come?

760
00:54:08,149 --> 00:54:09,917
I can't.
I've got work.

761
00:54:09,984 --> 00:54:11,953
Oh, yeah. The grind.

762
00:54:13,087 --> 00:54:16,258
- Wanna go to a Dodger game tomorrow?
- That sounds good.

763
00:54:16,358 --> 00:54:19,294
My sister and her boyfriend
got extra tickets. Box seats.

764
00:54:19,394 --> 00:54:22,397
No, wait. I can't.

765
00:54:22,431 --> 00:54:24,900
I just remembered,
I hate baseball.

766
00:54:24,967 --> 00:54:27,303
You hate baseball?

767
00:54:27,370 --> 00:54:30,340
Okay. Then we'll
just do something else.

768
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:32,675
- Just the two of us.
- Good.

769
00:54:32,709 --> 00:54:34,911
I'll pickyou up at work
around 6:00?

770
00:54:34,978 --> 00:54:37,814
No, don't do that.
I'll call you when I get home.

771
00:54:38,816 --> 00:54:41,318
- What's goin' on?
- Nothing.

772
00:54:41,385 --> 00:54:44,688
- Going out tomorrow night's great.
- Then why not tell me where you work?

773
00:54:44,788 --> 00:54:48,159
Are you doing something illegal?
Are you workin' for the mob?

774
00:54:49,694 --> 00:54:52,697
I just don't want
you to know, okay?

775
00:54:52,797 --> 00:54:55,467
What if I wanted to
send you flowers or somethin'?

776
00:54:55,533 --> 00:54:57,936
Well, you could
send them to the house.

777
00:54:58,036 --> 00:55:00,272
- Who'd sign for them?
- One of the kids.

778
00:55:00,338 --> 00:55:03,309
And what if they're not here?
Why are you makin' this so complicated?

779
00:55:03,375 --> 00:55:05,011
Then don't send me flowers.

780
00:55:05,111 --> 00:55:08,080
I just wanna know what it is
you do all day, that's all.

781
00:55:08,114 --> 00:55:11,651
Come on. Drop it.
Stop acting like Henry VIII.

782
00:55:12,418 --> 00:55:16,056
Just forget it, okay?
I'm sorry I cared.

783
00:55:16,156 --> 00:55:18,225
That's a shitty thing to say!

784
00:55:18,292 --> 00:55:20,627
You're just pissed off because
I don't wanna meet your sister.

785
00:55:21,428 --> 00:55:23,931
Who cares about my sister?

786
00:55:24,031 --> 00:55:27,735
All I said was she's been in a slump
'cause of the backstabber at her office.

787
00:55:27,835 --> 00:55:29,837
How do you know
this woman is a backstabber?

788
00:55:29,904 --> 00:55:33,575
Maybe she's nice. Why do you
have to be so judgmental about her?

789
00:55:33,675 --> 00:55:36,844
Look, Swell.
What's up with you, huh?

790
00:55:38,180 --> 00:55:42,351
Are you seein' someone else, or what?
'Cause that's what it sounds like.

791
00:55:42,418 --> 00:55:46,155
I mean, ifyou're seein' some other guy,
you don't have to do all this.

792
00:55:46,222 --> 00:55:48,324
You could just tell me,
just be honest.

793
00:55:48,391 --> 00:55:50,894
No, there is nobody else, okay?

794
00:55:52,228 --> 00:55:54,764
I just wish that
you could respect my privacy.

795
00:55:54,831 --> 00:55:57,401
I'd respect your privacy
ifyou weren't so secretive.

796
00:55:57,467 --> 00:56:00,237
I'd tell you more
ifyou didn't wanna know so much.

797
00:56:01,138 --> 00:56:04,041
Okay. Fine.

798
00:56:05,877 --> 00:56:07,846
I'm outta here.

799
00:57:32,637 --> 00:57:34,906
Doesn't look like Julia's.

800
00:57:35,006 --> 00:57:37,142
Shut up, Quizzoid. Eat.

801
00:57:38,610 --> 00:57:40,012
You're up.

802
00:57:40,078 --> 00:57:42,348
I've been at it all night.
Check these out.

803
00:57:42,448 --> 00:57:46,686
Beautiful Belgian waffles.
Julia made 'em on her show yesterday.

804
00:57:46,752 --> 00:57:50,056
- Did you turn the air-conditioner on?
- Well, I was hot.

805
00:57:50,089 --> 00:57:51,725
I'm stuck with the bills.

806
00:57:51,791 --> 00:57:55,495
I would like to keep
that thermostat at 76, okay?

807
00:57:55,528 --> 00:57:58,532
You take these things
so personally.

808
00:58:05,839 --> 00:58:08,209
- Where are all the dishes?
- In the dishwasher.

809
00:58:08,276 --> 00:58:11,946
- Then empty it.
- Well, that's Zach's job.

810
00:58:13,348 --> 00:58:14,683
I'll do it later.

811
00:58:15,617 --> 00:58:17,385
It was your turn
to dump the trash.

812
00:58:17,452 --> 00:58:19,388
I couldn't fit it
in my schedule.

813
00:58:30,934 --> 00:58:34,471
- Bryan didn't call yet, huh?
- Why not call the stud horse?

814
00:58:34,571 --> 00:58:36,340
I'm letting him cool off.

815
00:58:37,207 --> 00:58:40,310
I'll call him in a few weeks
when all this is over.

816
00:58:40,410 --> 00:58:43,380
Then I can just go to the beach
and take a towel and a Walkman...

817
00:58:43,414 --> 00:58:46,684
and lie in the sand
and rub oil on myself...

818
00:58:46,751 --> 00:58:49,754
and I won't have to interface
with anybody, and get tan.

819
00:58:49,854 --> 00:58:51,990
Little League sign-ups
are at 1 1 :30.

820
00:58:52,090 --> 00:58:55,260
- Don't forget.
- I can't. I've got a sales meeting.

821
00:58:55,293 --> 00:58:56,861
But you promised.

822
00:58:58,297 --> 00:59:01,133
- I know. I'm sorry.
- Gonna be late for work.

823
00:59:01,834 --> 00:59:05,071
Yeah, well,
enjoy your childhood.

824
00:59:17,250 --> 00:59:20,955
Tr.affic is r.eally tied up
on the northbound and southbound 405.

825
00:59:21,055 --> 00:59:22,956
A tr.uck is blocking
the slow lane.

826
00:59:23,924 --> 00:59:27,862
You looked so incredible in
that bathing suit. It was unbelievable.

827
00:59:56,326 --> 00:59:58,395
Operation Eggs Florentine
was a rousing success.

828
00:59:58,495 --> 01:00:00,497
The school board
is going to vote on it.

829
01:00:00,531 --> 01:00:03,301
The superintendent needs
cost estimates from us by Wednesday!

830
01:00:03,367 --> 01:00:05,603
This is going to triple
our profit margin.

831
01:00:05,703 --> 01:00:09,774
We'll finally prove
ourselves to New York.

832
01:00:09,841 --> 01:00:13,378
You got roses.
Who might they be from?

833
01:00:13,445 --> 01:00:16,014
They're foryou.

834
01:00:18,016 --> 01:00:22,388
Obviously our weekend away in Santa
Barbara was the turning point for us.

835
01:00:22,421 --> 01:00:25,224
Shades of real intimacy.

836
01:00:25,291 --> 01:00:28,427
Have you ever had
a 48-hour orgasm?

837
01:00:28,495 --> 01:00:30,063
I've never been
to Santa Barbara.

838
01:00:30,129 --> 01:00:34,301
Look at me. I'm glowing.
The man makes me glow. Am I glowing?

839
01:00:34,367 --> 01:00:35,869
You're shiny.

840
01:00:35,903 --> 01:00:38,839
Oh, God, I feel like a teenager.

841
01:00:38,906 --> 01:00:41,441
Here are your messages.

842
01:00:41,542 --> 01:00:45,579
Great. Thanks. I'm going
to go glow in my office.

843
01:00:50,718 --> 01:00:54,422
I stole her résumé from Personnel
to check her out.

844
01:00:54,489 --> 01:00:59,028
I had a feeling. None of these companies
ever heard of her. I'm going to Rose.

845
01:00:59,094 --> 01:01:01,163
But the void's getting by.

846
01:01:05,468 --> 01:01:08,404
And Rose loves her.
She's not going to care.

847
01:01:08,504 --> 01:01:10,640
You've got to get something
better on her than that.

848
01:01:12,409 --> 01:01:15,111
What did she do,
copy it from a résumé book?

849
01:01:19,283 --> 01:01:21,752
Crandell house?
We got your home entertainment center.

850
01:01:21,786 --> 01:01:25,089
Yeah. Set it up right over there.

851
01:01:25,189 --> 01:01:28,826
The vote on the unifor.m issue has been
pushed up. I need those estimates today.

852
01:01:28,893 --> 01:01:31,963
I don't see there being
any dilemma with that at all.

853
01:01:32,063 --> 01:01:34,066
We'll messenger them right over.

854
01:01:34,099 --> 01:01:39,071
How are the cost estimates for the
superintendent? He needs them today.

855
01:01:39,137 --> 01:01:42,107
I'm right on top of that, Rose.

856
01:01:53,019 --> 01:01:56,390
- Where's Cathy?
- I don't know. I'm a temp.

857
01:01:56,423 --> 01:01:57,625
Can I help?

858
01:02:00,027 --> 01:02:02,430
- She doesn't want to go with me.
- Just call her.

859
01:02:05,466 --> 01:02:09,170
Oh, hi, Carolyn. I'm sick.
This is a Q.E.D. report.

860
01:02:09,270 --> 01:02:13,108
I promised Sue Ellen I'd do it for her.
Would you see that she gets it?

861
01:02:13,175 --> 01:02:15,477
- It's really important. Thanks.
- Thankyou.

862
01:02:17,145 --> 01:02:20,750
I don't know why,
but she's keeping things from me.

863
01:02:20,816 --> 01:02:22,384
I think it's another guy.

864
01:02:22,452 --> 01:02:26,456
Maybe I should do something crazy,
like sweep her off her feet.

865
01:02:26,556 --> 01:02:29,793
Just forget about her.
She's not worth it.

866
01:02:29,859 --> 01:02:31,527
You deserve better.

867
01:02:31,595 --> 01:02:33,396
Problem?

868
01:02:44,709 --> 01:02:48,112
- Don't say anything. I understand.
- What do you understand?

869
01:02:48,179 --> 01:02:49,547
Well...

870
01:02:51,216 --> 01:02:57,122
either the scenario is that you want
to politely thank me for the roses...

871
01:02:57,155 --> 01:03:00,960
oryou burst in here
wanting to be impulsive...

872
01:03:01,027 --> 01:03:06,666
and ask me to go to Carmel
with you this weekend.

873
01:03:06,733 --> 01:03:09,135
Sure. We'll fly.
I have my pilot's license.

874
01:03:09,235 --> 01:03:12,139
Maybe I gave you the wrong idea,
but I'm not interested in you.

875
01:03:12,239 --> 01:03:17,211
Then why did you burst through my door
so determined, so eager?

876
01:03:17,278 --> 01:03:19,613
Why are you doing this to Rose?

877
01:03:19,713 --> 01:03:23,184
Hey, look, I'm kidding.
Maybe I gave you the wrong idea.

878
01:03:23,284 --> 01:03:26,921
- Why don't we start with the symphony?
- I'm not starting anything with you.

879
01:03:29,357 --> 01:03:32,161
- Thanks, guys. Bye.
- Anytime.

880
01:03:40,068 --> 01:03:41,504
Awesome.

881
01:03:57,521 --> 01:04:02,326
I say next batch we do more
mocha Swiss Amaretto ones.

882
01:04:02,393 --> 01:04:04,262
Mocha Swiss. Got it.

883
01:04:06,998 --> 01:04:10,201
- I need you!
- Gourmet munchies, man.

884
01:04:10,269 --> 01:04:12,404
Come help!

885
01:04:12,470 --> 01:04:15,007
Something's wrong
with the TV antenna.

886
01:04:15,074 --> 01:04:19,645
I'm in a meeting.
Have Bob Barker help you.

887
01:04:41,602 --> 01:04:46,140
- Go long.
- Thanks. Awesome.

888
01:04:56,885 --> 01:05:00,022
- What is that sound?
- There's something up there.

889
01:05:16,907 --> 01:05:18,842
Help! Somebody help me!

890
01:05:23,514 --> 01:05:25,784
Dude!

891
01:05:30,889 --> 01:05:32,491
Holy shit!

892
01:05:36,361 --> 01:05:38,430
- Your paycheck.
- Thankyou.

893
01:05:47,607 --> 01:05:50,844
Where have you been?
Where's the Q.E.D. report?

894
01:05:51,011 --> 01:05:52,880
Rose, I tried--

895
01:05:52,946 --> 01:05:55,049
Yes, the Q.E.D. report.

896
01:05:55,115 --> 01:05:58,052
I have that foryou.

897
01:05:58,085 --> 01:06:01,856
What are you doing with it?
What is Carolyn doing with it?

898
01:06:01,923 --> 01:06:06,561
Cathy brought it by. Seems she's been
covering for Sue Ellen, doing her work.

899
01:06:06,628 --> 01:06:08,630
You let Cathy do the Q.E.D. report?

900
01:06:15,037 --> 01:06:17,707
I was wondering
how you would get that...

901
01:06:17,773 --> 01:06:20,576
and the research for
the school presentation done.

902
01:06:20,609 --> 01:06:23,579
Bravo. You really know
how to delegate responsibility.

903
01:06:23,613 --> 01:06:26,349
You want to be executive material?

904
01:06:26,416 --> 01:06:28,719
Keep an eye on Sue Ellen.

905
01:06:28,819 --> 01:06:31,254
You are a paragon.

906
01:06:36,694 --> 01:06:39,764
- Lunch?
- I'd love to.

907
01:06:39,830 --> 01:06:41,999
- General Apparel West.
- Thanks for the roses.

908
01:06:42,100 --> 01:06:45,036
She's busy right now.
Can I take a message? Is this a joke?

909
01:06:45,136 --> 01:06:46,438
Don't mention it.

910
01:06:46,538 --> 01:06:50,375
River Ridge Hospital is on line three.
There's an emergency with your son?

911
01:06:50,442 --> 01:06:52,010
My son.

912
01:06:52,077 --> 01:06:53,712
- Your son?
- Her son?

913
01:06:54,613 --> 01:06:58,084
Hello? Yes, this is Mrs. Crandell.

914
01:06:59,418 --> 01:07:02,022
What? Oh, my God.

915
01:07:02,054 --> 01:07:05,525
I'll be right there. Will you please
tell him I will be right there?

916
01:07:05,591 --> 01:07:07,527
Thankyou.

917
01:07:07,594 --> 01:07:10,797
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. I hope so.

918
01:07:10,897 --> 01:07:14,335
- I didn't know you were married.
- I'm not. I'm divorced.

919
01:07:14,368 --> 01:07:16,637
It's a painful memory.
I don't like to talk about it.

920
01:07:29,585 --> 01:07:31,920
I'm looking for Walter Crandell.

921
01:07:32,020 --> 01:07:36,225
Swell, I don't know ifhe's okay. He's
in with the doctor. He better be okay.

922
01:07:36,292 --> 01:07:38,261
- What happened?
- I'm sorry.

923
01:07:38,327 --> 01:07:41,730
Mrs. Crandell, I'm Dr. Permutter.
Here he is.

924
01:07:41,798 --> 01:07:45,768
Oh, my-- I'm Mrs. Crandell,
Walter's mom.

925
01:07:45,836 --> 01:07:49,172
How is he? What happened?
How do you feel, honey? Are you okay?

926
01:07:49,239 --> 01:07:51,542
It's a clean break.
It should heal nicely.

927
01:07:51,608 --> 01:07:53,777
I fell off the roof.

928
01:07:53,844 --> 01:07:56,413
What was he doing on the roof?

929
01:07:56,481 --> 01:07:59,617
I wasn't there. I should have been.
I mean, not on the roof.

930
01:07:59,684 --> 01:08:02,654
But I should have been with him,
taking care of him.

931
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:05,456
Reading Gr.een EggsAnd Ham
or some shit like that.

932
01:08:05,524 --> 01:08:08,460
Walt, man,
I'm really sorry.

933
01:08:08,526 --> 01:08:11,496
You'll have to bring him back
for a walking cast in six weeks.

934
01:08:11,563 --> 01:08:14,466
Have him take one of those
if he has any pain.

935
01:08:14,500 --> 01:08:18,037
We'll stop and get you
an ice-cream cone, okay?

936
01:08:18,104 --> 01:08:20,139
That doesn't make up
foryour irresponsibility.

937
01:08:20,206 --> 01:08:23,643
Look! I screwed up!
I'm sorry.

938
01:08:23,743 --> 01:08:26,179
Is he your son too?

939
01:08:27,280 --> 01:08:30,183
No. He's my stepson.

940
01:08:31,485 --> 01:08:33,487
That's why we don't
get along so well.

941
01:08:33,587 --> 01:08:37,725
We better get along home for supper.
I'm making pot roast, Walter's favorite.

942
01:08:37,825 --> 01:08:40,528
Come on, kids. Let's go.
Chop, chop.

943
01:08:40,628 --> 01:08:42,664
- Take it easy.
- Help your brother.

944
01:08:42,730 --> 01:08:44,699
I can't believe you
let this happen to him.

945
01:08:44,766 --> 01:08:46,802
- Go to hell.
- Damn it!

946
01:08:54,944 --> 01:08:56,946
- Shit.
- What?

947
01:08:57,013 --> 01:08:59,749
My check is only for $735.

948
01:08:59,815 --> 01:09:02,052
I thought you were getting,
like, over a grand.

949
01:09:02,152 --> 01:09:05,288
Taxes. They took half
of my money away for taxes...

950
01:09:05,388 --> 01:09:07,791
and some savings
and pension plan.

951
01:09:09,827 --> 01:09:12,496
At least I have enough to cover
what we spent from petty cash.

952
01:09:12,563 --> 01:09:14,498
- How are you doing?
- Hollywood Squar.es are on.

953
01:09:14,565 --> 01:09:16,366
Bitchin'!

954
01:09:24,910 --> 01:09:28,113
- Where'd this come from?
- Japan. It's state of the art.

955
01:09:28,146 --> 01:09:33,285
It's nice, but where did you get the
money for something so state of the art?

956
01:09:33,385 --> 01:09:36,823
It was petty cash money.
You were spending petty cash money.

957
01:09:36,889 --> 01:09:41,794
I bought a pair of boots and a magazine!
You bought a home entertainment center?

958
01:09:41,861 --> 01:09:45,165
- It was Walter's idea.
- It's going back.

959
01:09:45,231 --> 01:09:47,300
We can't take it back.
We got it on sale.

960
01:09:47,367 --> 01:09:50,036
It wasn't your money.
It was my money.

961
01:09:50,104 --> 01:09:54,074
It wasn't really your money either.
You embezzled it.

962
01:09:54,141 --> 01:09:57,244
I did not embezzle it.
I borrowed it.

963
01:09:57,344 --> 01:10:01,983
I was going to put it back after my next
paycheck, but we can't afford all this.

964
01:10:02,050 --> 01:10:05,453
How could you do this?
You would never steal from Mom.

965
01:10:06,755 --> 01:10:08,824
That's because Mom
never had that much.

966
01:10:12,261 --> 01:10:14,330
There's only $30 left.

967
01:10:14,430 --> 01:10:16,799
You should see the Zsa Zsa diamond ring
he bought for Cynthia.

968
01:10:18,234 --> 01:10:20,169
You bought her a diamond?

969
01:10:20,269 --> 01:10:22,472
- How much was it?
- It was a chip.

970
01:10:22,538 --> 01:10:24,474
- Get it back.
- Diamonds are forever.

971
01:10:24,507 --> 01:10:28,545
I needed a new bike, and I got Walter
the new edition of Super.Passwor.d...

972
01:10:28,612 --> 01:10:30,280
and Elvis a new chew toy.

973
01:10:30,313 --> 01:10:32,616
You have spent over $3,000?

974
01:10:35,586 --> 01:10:37,555
You are all grounded.

975
01:10:38,422 --> 01:10:41,693
- How could you steal from me?
- They didn't really steal.

976
01:10:41,793 --> 01:10:45,096
They borrowed. They were following
your irresponsible example.

977
01:10:45,196 --> 01:10:49,134
Shut up. I am in deep shit.

978
01:10:49,234 --> 01:10:51,370
Quit your job.
Get out while you can.

979
01:10:51,437 --> 01:10:54,273
I'm an embezzler.
They're going to throw me in prison.

980
01:10:54,340 --> 01:10:57,477
The judge will probably go easy on you,
considering you're a minor.

981
01:10:57,543 --> 01:11:01,615
I'm not going to give up.
I'll just economize.

982
01:11:01,715 --> 01:11:05,018
I'll keep working.
I'll work overtime.

983
01:11:05,118 --> 01:11:08,321
A few more paychecks, I'll be able to
put it back and no one will know, right?

984
01:11:08,388 --> 01:11:09,656
I'm innocent.

985
01:11:12,092 --> 01:11:13,694
G.A.W.'s history.

986
01:11:13,794 --> 01:11:15,797
- We're going to be out of a job.
- What?

987
01:11:15,829 --> 01:11:19,801
The school board rejected it.
You were right.

988
01:11:19,867 --> 01:11:23,604
The students got wind of it
and held a huge protest.

989
01:11:23,638 --> 01:11:27,342
They burned uniforms in effigy.
This was our last hope.

990
01:11:27,442 --> 01:11:30,379
We're probably all
going to be canned tomorrow.

991
01:11:32,281 --> 01:11:34,784
Listen, can't you call New York?

992
01:11:34,884 --> 01:11:37,754
Convince them to give us more time
so we can keep working?

993
01:11:37,820 --> 01:11:40,957
Why bother?
It's not the end of the world.

994
01:11:41,023 --> 01:11:43,961
- It's just a job.
- But I need this job.

995
01:11:46,763 --> 01:11:49,599
I have to tell you.
I kind of have a problem.

996
01:11:49,667 --> 01:11:54,338
You're not going to have a problem.
You're going to be fine, believe me.

997
01:11:54,438 --> 01:11:56,641
With all your qualifications
and background...

998
01:11:56,707 --> 01:11:59,177
you're going to land
an even better job.

999
01:11:59,277 --> 01:12:01,512
Do me a favor, would you?

1000
01:12:01,580 --> 01:12:03,649
Would you break
the news to Franklin?

1001
01:12:03,715 --> 01:12:06,385
You're so good
at dealing with the staff.

1002
01:12:09,154 --> 01:12:14,426
With your qualifications and background,
you'll land an even better job.

1003
01:12:16,929 --> 01:12:18,998
Thanks.

1004
01:12:20,166 --> 01:12:23,603
You've been a real trouper
right to the end.

1005
01:12:25,138 --> 01:12:27,140
I'm going to miss you.

1006
01:13:34,547 --> 01:13:36,849
Rose, I have an idea.

1007
01:13:38,952 --> 01:13:41,988
This is going to save our
collective asses. It's fabulous.

1008
01:13:42,088 --> 01:13:46,292
I don't want New York to know anything
about it. They'd never approve funding.

1009
01:13:46,360 --> 01:13:51,365
You'll need to rent a banquet hall.
You do have enough in petty cash, right?

1010
01:13:51,432 --> 01:13:52,867
Well--

1011
01:13:55,002 --> 01:13:58,506
- I have to tell you something.
- Go ahead, honey.

1012
01:14:02,177 --> 01:14:06,114
Banquet halls are so impersonal.

1013
01:14:06,214 --> 01:14:09,551
My house is fabulous.
We can have it there. It'll be perfect.

1014
01:14:09,651 --> 01:14:12,087
We are a family of felons.

1015
01:14:12,154 --> 01:14:15,925
Our summer of freedom is going to be a
winter prison if I don't get some help.

1016
01:14:15,992 --> 01:14:19,229
I want this place spick-and-span
by Saturday, or I'm turning us all in.

1017
01:14:19,329 --> 01:14:20,831
Are you with me?

1018
01:14:22,732 --> 01:14:24,634
Guys, what do you say?

1019
01:14:24,735 --> 01:14:25,936
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

1020
01:14:26,002 --> 01:14:27,938
- Come on! What do you say?
- All right!

1021
01:14:28,005 --> 01:14:30,507
We're with you!
Rock and roll!

1022
01:14:41,686 --> 01:14:42,954
Thankyou.

1023
01:14:49,895 --> 01:14:53,432
- Take a look.
- I don't know. This is risky.

1024
01:14:53,533 --> 01:14:55,134
Let me show you one more thing.

1025
01:14:55,201 --> 01:15:00,439
Here is a normal waiter's uniform, but
I was thinking of changing the color.

1026
01:15:00,540 --> 01:15:03,744
Or it could be in black and white,
turquoise and black or red and black.

1027
01:15:36,045 --> 01:15:39,082
- Coffee, dear?
- Yeah.

1028
01:15:45,623 --> 01:15:49,693
Thankyou, everyone, for staying.
We're going to pull an all-nighter.

1029
01:15:54,766 --> 01:15:57,068
Strike two!

1030
01:15:57,135 --> 01:15:59,104
It's okay. You can do it.

1031
01:15:59,137 --> 01:16:02,006
I know you can. Concentrate.

1032
01:16:06,178 --> 01:16:08,948
Home run! Way to go!

1033
01:16:08,981 --> 01:16:10,917
That's my girl.

1034
01:16:24,564 --> 01:16:27,300
But the recipe calls for shrimp,
so I need some more cash.

1035
01:16:27,368 --> 01:16:30,705
I told you.
We have to economize.

1036
01:16:30,771 --> 01:16:33,007
There's nothing left in petty cash.
I've taken it all.

1037
01:16:35,543 --> 01:16:37,445
Just try to do the best you can.

1038
01:16:42,250 --> 01:16:45,420
Wait. I have a coupon for that.
It's a double coupon.

1039
01:17:19,691 --> 01:17:21,527
Where are the kids?

1040
01:17:21,627 --> 01:17:26,031
Zach's at Cynthia's,
Melissa's upstairs, and Walter's asleep.

1041
01:17:28,100 --> 01:17:31,704
- What's wrong with you?
- Nothing is wrong with me.

1042
01:17:36,509 --> 01:17:38,010
Did you burn something?

1043
01:17:38,111 --> 01:17:42,015
Maybe ifyou'd called and told me
you were going to be four hours late...

1044
01:17:42,116 --> 01:17:44,451
I could have planned
my dinner better.

1045
01:17:44,551 --> 01:17:48,222
- I had to work late, okay?
- You still should have called.

1046
01:17:48,289 --> 01:17:50,224
I sat, and I waited.

1047
01:17:50,291 --> 01:17:53,995
I went ahead and fed the kids.
I worked all day on that casserole.

1048
01:17:54,061 --> 01:17:55,129
Sorry.

1049
01:17:55,229 --> 01:17:57,332
You haven't even said
how nice the house looks.

1050
01:17:57,432 --> 01:17:59,968
You're off at the office all day
doing interesting office things.

1051
01:18:00,035 --> 01:18:03,705
I'm stuck here,
cooking and cleaning and mowing.

1052
01:18:03,772 --> 01:18:06,909
Helping Melissa with her fastball.
Being a role model forZach.

1053
01:18:06,975 --> 01:18:10,780
Spending quality time with Walter.
Doing your party shit!

1054
01:18:10,846 --> 01:18:13,716
You've got the car, and you don't
even take me anywhere anymore.

1055
01:18:13,783 --> 01:18:17,186
When was the last time we went out
to dinner together, huh?

1056
01:18:17,253 --> 01:18:20,156
I'm sick and tired
of not being appreciated.

1057
01:18:20,190 --> 01:18:21,992
I appreciate you.

1058
01:18:22,059 --> 01:18:24,228
Eat shit!

1059
01:18:25,295 --> 01:18:27,464
I don't believe this.

1060
01:18:27,531 --> 01:18:31,702
I have to get up at 5:30 every morning,
so I can beat rush-hour traffic...

1061
01:18:31,769 --> 01:18:37,208
and go sit behind a desk for eight hours
and miss Oprah every day of my vacation.

1062
01:18:37,275 --> 01:18:41,746
Then I get to drive home in gridlock
in a Volvo with no air-conditioning...

1063
01:18:41,813 --> 01:18:44,817
just so I can take care ofyou guys
and put food on the damn table.

1064
01:18:44,917 --> 01:18:47,219
It's a rat race,
and it sucks.

1065
01:18:47,319 --> 01:18:49,521
So what do you want, a medal?

1066
01:18:55,061 --> 01:18:57,531
You don't have to do all this.

1067
01:18:57,597 --> 01:18:59,599
I never asked you
to whisk the couch.

1068
01:18:59,666 --> 01:19:02,536
Well, it needed it.

1069
01:19:10,177 --> 01:19:13,781
I knew she was a phony.
I did not think she was a thief.

1070
01:19:22,157 --> 01:19:25,160
"Distinctive Valet Parking,
Classical Accompaniment Musicians."

1071
01:19:25,227 --> 01:19:28,364
- "K.C. Catering."
- "Bodacious Sculptures In Ice."

1072
01:19:30,533 --> 01:19:33,603
She didn't steal from petty cash.
She paid for the buyers' shindig.

1073
01:19:33,670 --> 01:19:36,439
It's all legit.

1074
01:19:36,506 --> 01:19:39,276
Let's get out ofhere.
I give up.

1075
01:19:55,627 --> 01:19:58,096
She's only 1 7.

1076
01:20:03,802 --> 01:20:05,904
Don't be r.ude to anybody.

1077
01:20:06,004 --> 01:20:07,906
Don't spit on anybody.

1078
01:20:08,007 --> 01:20:10,442
Don't wander off because
I want you to meet my boss.

1079
01:20:10,476 --> 01:20:13,179
- Remember. Call me Mommy.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1080
01:20:13,246 --> 01:20:16,483
- Let's rehearse. Melissa, come, honey!
- Okay, Mommy!

1081
01:20:18,185 --> 01:20:20,220
- Hi, Mrs. Crandell.
- Hi, kids.

1082
01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:22,289
Thanks for helping out.

1083
01:20:22,322 --> 01:20:24,358
- Where's Kenny?
- Getting ready.

1084
01:20:27,728 --> 01:20:30,865
- Good evening, Mrs. Crandell.
- You look great.

1085
01:20:30,965 --> 01:20:34,202
That's Kenneth.
The guests have started to arrive.

1086
01:20:34,268 --> 01:20:36,004
Man your trays.

1087
01:20:36,170 --> 01:20:38,073
Get going there.

1088
01:20:38,139 --> 01:20:41,443
Good tray. Good tray. All right.

1089
01:20:41,510 --> 01:20:43,445
Go get them, big man.

1090
01:20:46,381 --> 01:20:48,450
Better get your ass out there,
Mrs. Crandell.

1091
01:20:58,929 --> 01:21:00,196
Hi, Mommy.

1092
01:21:00,263 --> 01:21:02,532
This is my daughter, Melissa.

1093
01:21:02,566 --> 01:21:04,869
Hey, boss lady, creole mushroom?

1094
01:21:04,969 --> 01:21:07,438
Hello, Melissa.
No, thanks. Not tonight.

1095
01:21:07,505 --> 01:21:10,174
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

1096
01:21:10,241 --> 01:21:12,910
I love that they're wearing
our uniforms. Fabulous touch.

1097
01:21:15,714 --> 01:21:20,052
- Look at the jalopy.
- This is going to be so much fun.

1098
01:21:20,118 --> 01:21:24,423
- Yeah.
- Yo, mad dog. Want to park the car?

1099
01:21:24,489 --> 01:21:28,327
- We're on a break, dude.
- Park it yourself, Metallica breath.

1100
01:21:30,796 --> 01:21:33,366
I brought this Jell-O mold
just in case you needed one.

1101
01:21:33,433 --> 01:21:37,871
This is my husband, Howard.
I love your house. Oh, wow.

1102
01:21:39,973 --> 01:21:43,778
Take the baked Brie out of the oven.
It will caramelize.

1103
01:21:47,215 --> 01:21:51,653
- Where you been? You're our maitre d'.
- Cynthia dumped me for Jacob.

1104
01:21:51,719 --> 01:21:55,390
- Honey, I'm so sorry.
- I just don't understand.

1105
01:21:55,490 --> 01:21:58,393
- She was my moon goddess.
- I know.

1106
01:21:59,160 --> 01:22:01,129
- Get over it.
- Get the diamond back?

1107
01:22:01,196 --> 01:22:03,832
I'm out of rumaki.

1108
01:22:04,533 --> 01:22:07,636
Let me get that foryou.
I'm maitre d'.

1109
01:22:11,607 --> 01:22:13,209
Excuse me.

1110
01:22:14,577 --> 01:22:16,980
What is it? Something?

1111
01:22:17,047 --> 01:22:19,416
Since this is the biggest night
in G.A.W. history...

1112
01:22:19,483 --> 01:22:23,955
I thought you might like to know this
all rests in the hands of a child...

1113
01:22:24,055 --> 01:22:25,689
a child you hired.

1114
01:22:27,658 --> 01:22:30,828
This is by far and away
the most petty...

1115
01:22:31,696 --> 01:22:35,734
spiteful, vindictive machination
you have ever concocted.

1116
01:22:38,003 --> 01:22:40,572
Grow up, Carolyn.

1117
01:22:40,639 --> 01:22:42,875
We're here.
What do you want us to do?

1118
01:22:42,975 --> 01:22:46,078
Great. Why don't you go up
to my room and change?

1119
01:22:46,178 --> 01:22:48,648
I'll be up there
in a few seconds, okay?

1120
01:22:48,714 --> 01:22:50,650
This is going to be great.

1121
01:23:03,497 --> 01:23:07,101
I was looking foryou.
Great house.

1122
01:23:07,168 --> 01:23:09,170
- You look lovely.
- Thankyou.

1123
01:23:09,237 --> 01:23:12,073
-I know you said you're not interested--
-That's right. I'm not.

1124
01:23:12,139 --> 01:23:15,676
I understand why. I want you to know
I'm not taking this lightly.

1125
01:23:15,777 --> 01:23:18,013
I don't think it's fair--

1126
01:23:18,079 --> 01:23:20,582
I know. My timing is off.

1127
01:23:20,649 --> 01:23:23,419
I know you're just
getting over a divorce.

1128
01:23:23,485 --> 01:23:27,857
You can't imagine how off
your timing is. Forget it.

1129
01:23:28,891 --> 01:23:31,360
Or we could just have a wild,
sweaty fling. What do you think?

1130
01:23:32,462 --> 01:23:33,896
You know...

1131
01:23:35,265 --> 01:23:38,535
I think the scenario here
is that you're a sleazeball.

1132
01:23:38,602 --> 01:23:41,338
Hey. I was kidding.

1133
01:23:41,405 --> 01:23:43,007
I surrender.

1134
01:23:48,246 --> 01:23:50,815
What's this? What is this?

1135
01:23:52,584 --> 01:23:54,285
Just a little accident.

1136
01:23:57,489 --> 01:24:00,059
Gus has sort of
a little crush on me.

1137
01:24:00,125 --> 01:24:02,160
He's been coming on to you?

1138
01:24:02,260 --> 01:24:04,397
Come on.

1139
01:24:04,497 --> 01:24:06,866
You know how I feel about you.

1140
01:24:06,899 --> 01:24:09,669
You're the one I want to
listen to beautiful music with.

1141
01:24:09,702 --> 01:24:11,037
You.

1142
01:24:12,104 --> 01:24:14,040
He sent those roses to me.

1143
01:24:14,141 --> 01:24:17,177
That's not true!

1144
01:24:17,243 --> 01:24:19,479
Believe me.

1145
01:24:19,546 --> 01:24:23,350
We're all adults here, and we have
a presentation to get through.

1146
01:24:23,417 --> 01:24:25,820
The buyer from Saks
is looking foryou.

1147
01:24:27,055 --> 01:24:29,591
It's show time.

1148
01:24:33,428 --> 01:24:34,462
Good evening.

1149
01:24:37,065 --> 01:24:39,301
Thankyou.
I'm Rose Lindsey.

1150
01:24:39,368 --> 01:24:43,072
On behalf of General Apparel West,
I'd like to welcome you.

1151
01:24:43,105 --> 01:24:46,909
I'm sure you're all on the edge ofyour
seats wondering what we have in store.

1152
01:24:46,976 --> 01:24:51,948
So to conduct our presentation,
I'd like to introduce our hostess...

1153
01:24:52,015 --> 01:24:54,684
our recently named
employee of the month...

1154
01:24:54,751 --> 01:24:57,287
and the woman responsible
for all you're going to view tonight.

1155
01:25:02,325 --> 01:25:03,260
Thankyou.

1156
01:25:04,628 --> 01:25:06,163
Welcome, everyone.

1157
01:25:06,263 --> 01:25:09,834
For 1 2 years General Apparel West
has enjoyed a solid reputation...

1158
01:25:09,901 --> 01:25:13,872
as the manufacturer of quality uniforms,
but times, they are a-changin'.

1159
01:25:13,905 --> 01:25:15,907
We're growing.
We're expanding.

1160
01:25:15,974 --> 01:25:18,810
We're approaching the millennium
with a fresh attitude and look.

1161
01:25:18,911 --> 01:25:22,648
What we have foryou is a preview
of the General Apparel West to come.

1162
01:25:26,419 --> 01:25:28,888
Ladies and gentlemen,
General Apparel West proudly presents...

1163
01:25:28,988 --> 01:25:31,825
the teenage fashion wave
of the future.

1164
01:25:40,301 --> 01:25:43,070
Tess, Marcie and Donna
are wearing bellhop uniforms...

1165
01:25:43,137 --> 01:25:47,208
in fuchsia, purple and teal,
hand airbrushed silk with matching caps.

1166
01:25:47,275 --> 01:25:51,012
The epaulets and cuff detailing
are antique gold lace.

1167
01:25:51,112 --> 01:25:54,849
The jackets, in varying lengths,
are matched with sporty black pants...

1168
01:25:54,916 --> 01:25:56,952
or sleek miniskirts.

1169
01:25:57,018 --> 01:26:00,689
The basic General Apparel West uniform
has been modified and accessorized...

1170
01:26:00,756 --> 01:26:05,228
to create a fun and sexy look
for the teenage girl.

1171
01:26:07,397 --> 01:26:10,866
Nicole is wearing a form-fitting
nurse's uniform with mini-hemline.

1172
01:26:10,934 --> 01:26:12,769
It'll speed up any boy's pulse.

1173
01:26:14,871 --> 01:26:17,307
The black diamonds
on Nicole's cap and dress...

1174
01:26:17,374 --> 01:26:19,576
are hand airbrushed
on fuchsia spandex.

1175
01:26:20,410 --> 01:26:24,248
Her pink high-top sneakers
are laced up her tangerine tights.

1176
01:26:24,348 --> 01:26:28,853
Of course, no nurse would be complete
without her stethoscope necklace.

1177
01:26:36,895 --> 01:26:39,865
Jill, our referee, is wearing
an oversized silk jersey...

1178
01:26:39,931 --> 01:26:43,869
in bold black-and-turquoise stripes,
black tights and high-top sneakers.

1179
01:26:44,770 --> 01:26:48,041
Her whistle earrings and necklace
and black baseball cap...

1180
01:26:48,107 --> 01:26:50,043
complement this carefree
and spirited look with the girl...

1181
01:26:50,110 --> 01:26:52,612
who's playing the field
and calling all the plays.

1182
01:26:54,881 --> 01:26:56,883
Swell, it's me. It's Bryan.

1183
01:26:56,917 --> 01:26:59,853
We got to talk about this.
Forget about this other guy.

1184
01:26:59,920 --> 01:27:03,224
We can wor.k this out.
It was r.eally stupid what happened.

1185
01:27:03,324 --> 01:27:06,260
I don't know ifit was some kind
of communication meltdown or. what.

1186
01:27:07,194 --> 01:27:10,098
- Katrina, our chef, is...
- We should wor.k it out.

1187
01:27:10,198 --> 01:27:12,133
really cooking in her scarf.

1188
01:27:12,233 --> 01:27:15,037
She's whipping up excitement
in her boots. Thank you.

1189
01:27:15,103 --> 01:27:16,038
Thank you.

1190
01:27:17,306 --> 01:27:21,476
I r.eally car.e about us.
Ther.e's something aboutyou.

1191
01:27:21,544 --> 01:27:25,514
I don't even know what it is, but I feel
better around you than anyone else.

1192
01:27:25,582 --> 01:27:28,151
- That's why I r.eally missyou.
- Our last model is Becky.

1193
01:27:29,519 --> 01:27:32,756
Becky is our Boy Scout.
She's wearing a Boy Scout's uniform.

1194
01:27:32,822 --> 01:27:34,758
Thank you.

1195
01:27:34,825 --> 01:27:36,526
Thank you.

1196
01:27:45,870 --> 01:27:50,475
And, everyone, the highlight
of our fashion extravaganza.

1197
01:27:50,541 --> 01:27:53,678
Young Bryan, our Clown Dog server.

1198
01:27:59,985 --> 01:28:01,186
You're having a party?

1199
01:28:02,388 --> 01:28:06,859
Bryan is wearing
a Clown Dog uniform...

1200
01:28:06,959 --> 01:28:12,298
with a classic wedge cap,
evoking the charming nostalgia--

1201
01:28:12,366 --> 01:28:14,301
- What?
- Mom's home.

1202
01:28:16,103 --> 01:28:17,804
Hi, Mom.

1203
01:28:20,274 --> 01:28:22,410
- Busted.
- Dude.

1204
01:28:23,978 --> 01:28:27,148
And that is our presentation
for this evening. Thankyou for coming.

1205
01:28:27,248 --> 01:28:29,384
Good night.

1206
01:28:29,484 --> 01:28:31,986
- What are you doing?
- I'm right on top of that.

1207
01:28:32,086 --> 01:28:33,522
Finish the presentation.

1208
01:28:33,588 --> 01:28:36,725
- It's not as bad as you think.
- Save it.

1209
01:28:36,792 --> 01:28:38,060
Shit.

1210
01:28:38,127 --> 01:28:40,662
Go on.Just do it.

1211
01:28:40,762 --> 01:28:44,167
Swell! You're in big trouble,
young lady.

1212
01:28:48,638 --> 01:28:50,840
I can't handle this anymore.

1213
01:28:50,907 --> 01:28:53,710
I applied for a receptionist job.

1214
01:28:53,810 --> 01:28:57,381
I don't even know what an executive
administrator assistant does.

1215
01:28:57,481 --> 01:29:01,986
I lied to everyone
about everything...

1216
01:29:02,052 --> 01:29:04,422
and I'm sorry.

1217
01:29:08,493 --> 01:29:12,431
I'm only 1 7. I have a curfew.
I just finished high school.

1218
01:29:12,531 --> 01:29:14,666
I can't even vote yet.

1219
01:29:14,766 --> 01:29:17,269
This was supposed
to be my summer vacation.

1220
01:29:17,369 --> 01:29:19,305
I'm not supposed
to be a career mom.

1221
01:29:19,371 --> 01:29:23,909
I can't be the hub
ofyour communication network.

1222
01:29:25,444 --> 01:29:28,648
I'm really not ready
for any of this.

1223
01:29:28,714 --> 01:29:30,150
I'm sorry.

1224
01:29:31,318 --> 01:29:32,652
I'm so sorry.

1225
01:29:34,254 --> 01:29:36,123
I'm sorry.

1226
01:29:37,758 --> 01:29:40,027
How humiliating. I love it.

1227
01:29:40,127 --> 01:29:42,630
Yeah, babe.Justice is served.

1228
01:29:49,971 --> 01:29:52,608
What are you doing here?

1229
01:29:52,674 --> 01:29:56,578
So do you believe me now? Or are
you just going to believe some kid?

1230
01:29:56,612 --> 01:29:58,915
I'm going to believe some kid.

1231
01:29:59,015 --> 01:30:01,417
Go to hell.

1232
01:30:03,252 --> 01:30:06,456
I'm not real clear about
what's been going on around here...

1233
01:30:06,522 --> 01:30:08,859
but I want these people
off my property.

1234
01:30:08,925 --> 01:30:12,128
I want you to start doing
some heavy-duty explaining.

1235
01:30:12,195 --> 01:30:16,133
I am never trusting you again.
I specifically said no parties.

1236
01:30:16,199 --> 01:30:17,534
You weren't supposed
to come home yet.

1237
01:30:17,601 --> 01:30:20,804
Sorry to have messed up your plans.
Who are these people?

1238
01:30:20,872 --> 01:30:24,309
- Mom, calm down.
- I will not calm down.

1239
01:30:24,409 --> 01:30:26,210
What happened to Walter?

1240
01:30:26,277 --> 01:30:29,781
He had a little accident,
but everything is taken care of.

1241
01:30:29,848 --> 01:30:31,816
We have excellent
medical coverage.

1242
01:30:31,850 --> 01:30:33,919
We will clean up the party.

1243
01:30:34,019 --> 01:30:37,590
You've had a long flight,
and you're cranky.

1244
01:30:37,690 --> 01:30:39,658
I have had a very rough night.

1245
01:30:39,692 --> 01:30:41,661
Why don't you go upstairs
and take a nap?

1246
01:30:41,694 --> 01:30:44,798
Tomorrow morning Kenny will whip up
a batch of Belgium waffles...

1247
01:30:44,898 --> 01:30:48,034
and we'll sit down
and discuss this like adults.

1248
01:30:48,134 --> 01:30:49,803
Fine.

1249
01:30:49,903 --> 01:30:52,405
Why don't you guys
go wrap up the party?

1250
01:30:52,472 --> 01:30:55,943
- Why don't you help Walter to bed?
- Good night, Mom-- I mean, Swell.

1251
01:30:59,680 --> 01:31:01,181
Thankyou.

1252
01:31:02,249 --> 01:31:06,287
- What did you do to yourself?
- We'll talk about it in the morning.

1253
01:31:06,354 --> 01:31:09,491
But for now, why don't you
just go to your room?

1254
01:31:22,104 --> 01:31:26,275
- I can't believe it.
- Oh, that's very funny.

1255
01:31:26,375 --> 01:31:27,977
What?

1256
01:31:39,357 --> 01:31:40,958
I'll be damned.

1257
01:31:53,305 --> 01:31:55,240
I am so sorry.

1258
01:31:57,209 --> 01:32:01,881
The buyers didn't care anything
about that scene.

1259
01:32:01,947 --> 01:32:04,917
They're all just
a bunch of old whores.

1260
01:32:04,984 --> 01:32:06,619
They loved your ideas.

1261
01:32:06,686 --> 01:32:09,021
I see nothing but dollar signs.

1262
01:32:09,089 --> 01:32:11,024
As a matter of fact,
they complimented me...

1263
01:32:11,090 --> 01:32:14,428
on hiring a teenager
to gain market perspective.

1264
01:32:14,461 --> 01:32:17,998
I've got seven meetings
set up next week alone.

1265
01:32:18,098 --> 01:32:20,401
They want the new G.A.W. Iine.

1266
01:32:21,603 --> 01:32:24,772
But what about everything else?

1267
01:32:24,839 --> 01:32:29,144
I lied to you.
I'm a terrible person.

1268
01:32:29,210 --> 01:32:32,747
Well, I suppose
you'll grow out of that.

1269
01:32:33,816 --> 01:32:35,184
Maybe.

1270
01:32:38,921 --> 01:32:44,727
Dude, that was a superior party.
Superior eats.

1271
01:32:44,828 --> 01:32:48,832
- Yeah. Thanks for helping out.
- No problem.

1272
01:32:48,898 --> 01:32:51,167
What do you say,
beer bust tomorrow night?

1273
01:32:51,267 --> 01:32:54,605
I can't. I got a date
with Swell's friend Nicole.

1274
01:32:54,672 --> 01:32:56,607
- The nurse?
- Yeah.

1275
01:32:57,708 --> 01:32:58,843
Hot.

1276
01:33:00,044 --> 01:33:03,781
School starts next week.
Lazy days.

1277
01:33:03,848 --> 01:33:07,852
I don't know. I was thinking
I might go to class more.

1278
01:33:07,952 --> 01:33:09,154
Why?

1279
01:33:10,588 --> 01:33:13,258
Well, it's time to finish up school.

1280
01:33:14,293 --> 01:33:16,228
I might take some Home Ec.

1281
01:33:16,295 --> 01:33:17,530
Graduate.

1282
01:33:17,630 --> 01:33:21,233
Maybe go to the culinary academy
or some shit like that.

1283
01:33:21,300 --> 01:33:25,772
- That could be cool.
- Yeah. It's time to do something.

1284
01:33:25,872 --> 01:33:29,343
Please reconsider. I'm offering you
a wonderful opportunity.

1285
01:33:29,409 --> 01:33:33,246
I know.
I appreciate it a lot. Really.

1286
01:33:33,313 --> 01:33:37,184
But I think
I'm going to try college.

1287
01:33:37,251 --> 01:33:40,988
Design school or something. I don't
know. I still have a lot to learn.

1288
01:33:41,055 --> 01:33:43,625
Ifyou want to get into Vassar,
I could pull some strings.

1289
01:33:43,691 --> 01:33:45,126
Maybe.

1290
01:33:47,929 --> 01:33:49,864
I'm going to miss you.

1291
01:33:49,932 --> 01:33:52,534
I'm going to miss you too.

1292
01:34:00,577 --> 01:34:02,478
Thankyou.

1293
01:34:09,752 --> 01:34:11,755
Let's get together Monday night.
We'll have dinner.

1294
01:34:13,557 --> 01:34:15,893
Bye, sweetie.

1295
01:34:48,161 --> 01:34:50,564
I'm really sorry.

1296
01:34:50,630 --> 01:34:52,867
Yeah.

1297
01:34:52,933 --> 01:34:57,271
Carolyn and I both pretty much
figured out what's been going on.

1298
01:34:57,338 --> 01:34:59,073
Is that everything?

1299
01:34:59,140 --> 01:35:01,776
There isn't anything else
you haven't told me, right?

1300
01:35:02,577 --> 01:35:05,380
You're not really a guy, are you?

1301
01:35:10,953 --> 01:35:15,557
So, did you mean what you said
about working things out?

1302
01:35:15,624 --> 01:35:18,060
We broke up. Remember?

1303
01:35:18,161 --> 01:35:20,262
We didn't break up.
We had a fight.

1304
01:35:20,362 --> 01:35:23,633
- Yeah, because you were lying to me.
- Yeah, but that's over.

1305
01:35:23,700 --> 01:35:28,338
So ifyou thought we broke up, I guess
you thought we were together, huh?

1306
01:35:28,438 --> 01:35:30,274
Well, yeah.

1307
01:35:30,340 --> 01:35:35,045
Anyway, I guess now
that I know the truth--

1308
01:35:40,751 --> 01:35:43,088
Well, thanks for sticking around.

1309
01:35:47,158 --> 01:35:49,861
What are you doing
New Year's Eve?

1310
01:36:03,209 --> 01:36:05,879
I think this is another
really good moment.

1311
01:36:05,945 --> 01:36:08,348
Me too.

1312
01:36:16,590 --> 01:36:18,659
How'd you thinkyou could get away
with all this anyway?

1313
01:36:18,759 --> 01:36:20,528
I pretty much did.

1314
01:36:20,595 --> 01:36:24,065
- Swell, one more thing.
- Yeah, Mom?

1315
01:36:24,165 --> 01:36:26,101
Where is the baby-sitter?

1316
01:36:44,554 --> 01:36:46,923
I'm really going to miss her.

1317
01:36:46,990 --> 01:36:49,326
You never even knew her.

1318
01:36:49,392 --> 01:36:52,196
Yeah, but she left us
all her money.

1319
01:36:52,262 --> 01:36:54,531
She's already dead, you moron!

1320
01:36:55,599 --> 01:36:57,301
Well, that's true.

1321
01:36:59,370 --> 01:37:02,841
How about Vegas this weekend?
Got any money left?

1322
01:37:03,841 --> 01:37:13,841
