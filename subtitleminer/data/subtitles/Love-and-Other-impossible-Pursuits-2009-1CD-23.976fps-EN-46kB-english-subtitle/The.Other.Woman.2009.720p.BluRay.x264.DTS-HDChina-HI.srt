for two whole years?

149
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:07,634
- It's not nerdy to be smart.

150
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,010
- Wait, this is the age
of the nerd.

151
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:10,303
That was a compliment.

153
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:14,933

00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:49,634
that die eating their pudding
directly from the container.

167
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:53,638
The body count is crazy.

168
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:58,101
- Emilia, do you know
what eBay is?

169
00:07:58,227 --> 00:07:59,394
- Yes, I do.

170
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,856
- My friend Bailey's dad
sells things on eBay.

171
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:06,526
He takes all their old stuff
they don't need anymore,

172
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:09,029
like Bailey's old bike,
and sells it.

173
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:11,406
- That's nice.

174
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:13,783
- Maybe you should go on eBay.

175
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,202
- I figure if I need
an old bike,

176
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:17,120
Bailey's dad
will sell it to me.

177
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:19,706
- Not to buy.

178
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:21,708
To sell.

179
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:24,753
To make money.

180
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,046
Don't you have any old stuff?

181
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:30,008
- I have strawberry
Tofutti Cuties, like new,

182
00:08:30,134 --> 00:08:32,594
in original box.

183
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,179
- I mean the baby's stuff.

184
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:38,016
We should sell
the baby's stuff on eBay.

185
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:43,605
We can sell the crib.

186
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:47,776
The crib cost exactly $1,31 1.

187
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:49,486
Dad told me.

188
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:54,324
So I bet we can get $2,000
for the crib.

189
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:55,784
Maybe even $10,000.

190
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,661
- No, we wouldn't.

191
00:08:57,787 --> 00:08:59,204
- That's how eBay works.

192
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:01,957
Take all the old stuff
you don't need anymore,

193
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,416
and people give you
money for it.

194
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:06,211
- We wouldn't get $10,000
for the crib on eBay,

195
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:07,754
okay, William?

196
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,256
- We can sell the stroller too.

197
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:12,342
I bet we can get $5,000
for the stroller.

198
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:13,927
- That's not how it works.

199
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:16,179
You're not going to get all
that money for something used

200
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:17,806
when you could get it new
for a lot less.

201
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:19,099
That doesn't even make sense.

202
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:21,142
- It's not used, though.

203
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:23,103
We never used it.

204
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:24,521
Bailey's dad says-

205
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:26,439
- William, I really
don't want to talk

206
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,191
about selling
the baby's things, okay?

207
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:30,277
- But that's what it's for.

208
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:31,653
- William, shut up!

209
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:33,863
Just shut up about eBay, okay?

210
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:46,710
Leave me alone, please.

211
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:48,795
Just go watch TV or something.

212
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:50,922
Leave me.

213
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:00,974
- I'm home.

214
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:05,854
- In here.

215
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:10,775
- Thai.

216
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:14,279
Great.

217
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:15,488
Can I give you a hand?

218
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:18,325
- I got it under control.

219
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:19,492
[dishes clatter]

220
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:20,660
- Yeah?

221
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:22,704
[chuckling]

222
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:23,955
Hello.

223
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:30,962
So what'd you guys do today?

224
00:10:31,088 --> 00:10:32,547
- Oh, built
a cold fusion reactor

225
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:34,299
out of swizzle sticks
and rubber bands.

226
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:37,093
- [laughs]

227
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:39,888
- We had a little thing,
actually.

228
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:41,723
- Dad, Dad!

229
00:10:41,849 --> 00:10:42,891
- Hey.

230
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:44,184
- I missed you so much.

231
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,727
- I missed you too, Will.

232
00:10:45,853 --> 00:10:48,772
- Who wants to help
set the table?

233
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:51,441
- Emilia told me
to shut up today.

234
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:52,651
And she yelled at me.

235
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:54,694
- Really?

236
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:58,281
What's going on?

237
00:10:58,407 --> 00:11:02,869
- William suggested that we sell
the baby's things on eBay.

238
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:06,498
The crib and the stroller.

239
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,545
- Okay.

240
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:14,381
- Well, we don't have
to sell those things.

241
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:17,550
Anything that we're not using
is okay.

242
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:20,595
Like, we can sell
my old MEGA Bloks,

243
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:22,097
'cause I don't use
those anymore.

244
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:24,015
- Yeah, but you didn't say
your old MEGA Bloks.

245
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:25,183
You said the baby's things.

246
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:26,726
- Just a minute, Em.

247
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:29,479
- Will, did you really want
to sell the baby's things?

248
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:31,481
- What?
I just told you.

249
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:34,359
- A minute, Em, please.

250
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:36,277
Will?

251
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:38,822
- Well, I wanted to do eBay,

252
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:41,950
and I was trying to think
of things we aren't using.

253
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:43,743
So I figured,
the baby's dead.

254
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:46,496
She's not gonna be using
her stuff anymore.

255
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:50,125
I didn't mean to make
Emilia so mad.

256
00:11:55,589 --> 00:12:00,635
- See, Emilia is so sad
about the baby

257
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:03,430
that it's hard for her to think
about selling the baby's things.

258
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:05,598
And you're right.

259
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:06,933
We don't need them anymore,

260
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:10,311
but she's right too.

261
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:12,313
We're not gonna sell
the baby's things.

262
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:14,899
- Okay.

263
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:16,943
I'm sorry, Dad.

264
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:20,822
- I know you didn't mean
to hurt anyone's feelings.

265
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:22,449
[chuckles]

266
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:23,616
I know it.

267
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:26,077
And Emilia knows it.

268
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:28,121
And she's sorry too.

269
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:32,792
Right, Emilia?

270
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:36,629
- I know I have to clear
her room out.

271
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:42,469
I just can't pack up
all her stuff yet.

272
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:46,014
- It's okay.

273
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:51,144
- I'm not building a shrine
or anything.

274
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,146
- I know.
It's okay.

275
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:57,692
- I'm sorry I said "shut up."

276
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:08,328
I'm gonna read, okay?

277
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:09,621
- Okay.

278
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:13,792
Good night.

279
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:16,544
- Good night.

280
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:31,476
- I'm so happy to be here.

281
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:34,479
- Oh, we're delighted
to have you, Miss Greenleaf.

282
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:37,524
This is a great opportunity
for you to start your career.

283
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:38,733
- I'm so excited.

284
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:40,401
I've been hearing
about Friedman Taft

285
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:43,112
from my father since as long
as I can remember.

286
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:44,239
- Is your father a lawyer?

287
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:46,699
- A judge in Westchester.

288
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:49,536
President of the New York
Bar Association, formerly.

289
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:50,829
- Oh, right, yes.

290
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:51,871
That's in here.

291
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:53,289
Oh, oh!

292
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:54,457
Oh.

293
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:56,042
- Oh, are you okay?
- Marilyn.

294
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:57,877
- My ankle!
Jack, yes.

295
00:13:58,003 --> 00:14:00,255
Just need a minute.

296
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:02,298
- Does it hurt when I squeeze?

297
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:03,383
- Ouch!

298
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:04,551
Yes.

299
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:06,511
- Oh, could you just
grab that door?

300
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:07,679
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

301
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:08,805
Okay, slowly, Marilyn.

302
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:09,973
Slowly, slowly, slowly.

303
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:12,350
- I feel so stupid, Jack.

304
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:13,852
- Okay.

305
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:15,812
There you go.

306
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:16,896
- [groans]

307
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:18,565
- All right.

308
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:19,899
All right.

309
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:22,110
- I'm the new associate,
by the way, Emilia Greenleaf.

310
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:23,236
- Jack Woolf.

311
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:24,737
- Nice to meet you.

312
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,781
- Same.

313
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:29,951
- Miss Greenleaf,
you're in room 1818.

314
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:33,079
Thank you.

315
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:34,372
- I'll get some ice, okay?

316
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:36,916
- Ice, yes, please.

317
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:38,668
- Of course he's married.

318
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:40,003
He's a senior partner.

319
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:42,046
They're always married.
What'd you expect?

320
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:44,257
- I just-I thought
I'd get over this months ago.

321
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:46,259
But I'm still, like, weak
when I'm around him,

322
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:48,970
and he doesn't even know
I'm alive.

323
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:50,263
- "He doesn't know I'm alive"?

324
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:51,848
What, are you in
the cliché Olympics?

325
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:54,559
- Ha-ha. Don't you
street lawyers have paralegals?

326
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:56,019
- No, friends are cheaper.

327
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:57,353
- I'm sorry I'm late, you guys.

328

- He is.

492
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:46,072
You know, there's something
I've been thinking about.

493
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:48,407
- I think we
should move in together.

494
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:50,618
- Emilia-
- Just hear me out.

495
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:53,829
I love you,
and I know you love me too.

496
00:22:53,955 --> 00:22:57,124
- I love you.
I do.

497
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:58,834
But I have a family.

498
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,294
- You have a son, Jack.

499
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,754
You don't have a marriage.

500
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:02,922
You've said that a lot.

501
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:04,673
- Okay, fine, I have a son.

502
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,133
That's more than a marriage.

503
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:08,344
And he's not the happiest kid.

504
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:09,512
He's not unhappy.

505
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:11,597
He just-
he's lonely.

506
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:14,642
It's bad when your kid
is lonely.

507
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:17,186
I mean, I used to think
we should have had more

508
00:23:17,312 --> 00:23:18,396
for Will, mainly.

509
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:21,065
But Carolyn-

510
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:22,733
anyway, we-

511
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:23,984
I'm glad we didn't.

512
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:27,238
Screwing up one child
is enough for a lifetime.

513
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:30,533
I'm done.

514
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:33,619
- [whimpering]

515
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:35,246
- What?

516
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:37,623
- [sobs]

517
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:39,375
- Emilia.

518
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:41,168
- I'm on the pill.

519
00:23:41,294 --> 00:23:43,629
I don't understand.

520
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:49,718
Look, don't-
don't worry about it, okay?

521
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:50,970
It's early.

522
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:52,555
It's, like, eight weeks
or something,

523
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:56,475
so it won't be a problem.

524
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:58,853
- No.

525
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:00,438
[laughter]

526
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:02,106
- To Emilia and Jack.

527
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:04,900
May their marriage be long
and fruitful.

528
00:24:05,026 --> 00:24:06,485
- Well, fruitful we can do.

529
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:09,613
[laughter]

530
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:16,829
I'm so glad you came.
Thank you.

531
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:18,247
It's so soon.

532
00:24:18,373 --> 00:24:20,332
- No, it's good for me
to get out of the house.

533
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:24,628
And I'm so happy
that you're expecting.

534
00:24:24,754 --> 00:24:26,464
Don't think I'm envious,
honestly.

535
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:28,132
- This is gonna be you
before you know it.

536
00:24:28,258 --> 00:24:29,175
- Hmm.

537
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:30,301
I know.

538
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:31,510
We're already trying, so-

539
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:33,679
- Wow, that's so quick.
That's great.

540
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:36,223
- How long have your father
and Jack known each other?

541
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:38,184
- Oh, we all had dinner together
last month

542
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,311
just before the divorce
came through.

543
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:42,354
But they got along right away.

544
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:43,939
They have private jokes already.

545
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:45,608
- Hmm, well, they're a day away

546
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:48,319
from wearing each other's
clothes just for fun.

547
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:50,779
- Well, we all end up marrying
our fathers, don't we?

548
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:53,699
- Yes, I only fuck men in shorts
and black socks

549
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:55,034
who make me join Little League.

550
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,368
It's weird.

551
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:58,704
- Jack and my dad
couldn't be more different.

552
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:04,960
Jack's so principled.

553
00:25:05,086 --> 00:25:06,128
- Have you met the kid yet?

554
00:25:06,254 --> 00:25:08,047
- Saturday.

555
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:09,590
But from Jack's stories,

556
00:25:09,716 --> 00:25:11,926
I get the feeling
he's a little high-maintenance.

557
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:13,052
- Whatever.

558
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:14,386
That's the one you want
to please

559
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:15,679
if you want this to work out.

560
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:28,025
- Roy G. Biv.
Roy G. Biv.

561
00:25:28,151 --> 00:25:29,944
- Jack.

562
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:34,281
- Red, orange, yellow, green.

563
00:25:34,407 --> 00:25:36,617
- Hi, guys.
- Hi.

564
00:25:36,743 --> 00:25:39,703
Will, this is Emilia.

565
00:25:39,829 --> 00:25:41,622
- Pleased to meet you.

566
00:25:41,748 --> 00:25:45,209
- Pleased to meet you too.

567
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:46,919
This is for you.

568
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:49,964
I got it at the Museum
of Natural History next door.

569
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:51,840
That's why I was late.

570
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:55,719
Your dad told me
it's your favorite place.

571
00:25:55,845 --> 00:25:59,557
- There's no evidence
that theropods were orange.

572
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:02,059
Plus, I'm eight.

573
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:05,396
- Well, I guess
it's not very realistic, huh?

574
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:07,648
But there's also a book
in there about Central Park,

575
00:26:07,774 --> 00:26:11,068
which is my favorite place
since I was about your age.

576
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:18,784
- Anyway, thank you.

577
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:20,494
- You know, there's a show
at 1 0:30.

578
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,621
We should go.

579
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:28,752
- You may kiss the bride.

580
00:26:28,878 --> 00:26:31,880
[applause]

581
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:53,986
- Oh, good.
William is upstairs.

582
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:55,154
- Okay.
- No, no, no.

583
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:59,366
Dr. Soule says to wait here.

584
00:26:59,492 --> 00:27:00,993
- I guess I'm a security risk.

585
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:04,079
- You're late.

586
00:27:04,205 --> 00:27:06,123
- No, I am not late.
Your father's late.

587
00:27:06,249 --> 00:27:08,584
- He disappoints,
because he was hoping

588
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:09,793
to see his father.

589
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:11,629
- Me too.

590
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:13,380
I disappoint too.

591
00:27:13,506 --> 00:27:16,050
- Okay, William.

592
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:17,926
See you Monday.

593
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:19,678
Good-bye, Miss Emilia.

594
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:24,350
- When is my father coming home?

595
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:25,768
- By 8:00.

596
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:28,937
That's, like, three hours, okay?

597
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:30,773
- That sucks.
- Don't say "sucks."

598
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:32,566
Your mom's gonna think
you heard it from me.

599
00:27:32,692 --> 00:27:35,402
- I did hear it from you.

600
00:27:35,528 --> 00:27:38,113
- William, why do we
have to fight all the time?

601
00:27:38,239 --> 00:27:42,534
I just-
let's have a nice time, okay?

602
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:44,620
How about we get
ice cream sundaes for supper,

603
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:46,914
hot fudge?

604
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,791
I want to eat one
the size of your head.

605
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:51,210
- I'm lactose-intolerant.

606
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:54,046
I could get very ill
from eating ice cream.

607
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:55,673
- Okay.

608
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:57,383
We'll just see whatever
is in the fridge.

609
00:27:57,509 --> 00:28:01,887
Chinese, Thai,
old and cold, but whatever.

610
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:04,390
- Rainbow sherbet-
that's no dairy-

611
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:07,393
or sorbet: lemon, lime,
coconut, and peach.

612
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:09,019
Everything else has dairy.

613
00:28:09,145 --> 00:28:12,940
- Oh, I guess I'll have sorbet.

614
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:14,108
Lemon.

615
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:15,734
- No, he'll have
a hot chocolate

616
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,903
and a banana split.

617
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:20,072
You want strawberry sauce
or chocolate?

618
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:21,365
- I can't have that.

619
00:28:21,491 --> 00:28:22,991
I'm lactose-intolerant.

620
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:25,119
- No, you have that powder here,
right, don't you,

621
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:28,247
that takes care
of lactose-intolerance?

622
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:31,291
- Yeah?

623
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:33,127
- Yeah, William,
they have this powder here,

624
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:34,878
and you sprinkle it
all over your ice cream.

625
00:28:35,004 --> 00:28:36,088
And you don't even taste it,

626
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:38,006
but you can have whatever
you want that way.

627
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:41,427
- My mother isn't convinced
that kind of lactase works.

628
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:43,053
- William, please,
it's science.

629
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:45,055
He'll have
the strawberry sauce, please.

630
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:50,144
- No, chocolate.

631
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:55,274
And my ice cream flavors
are chocolate, chocolate chip,

632
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,443
and cookie dough.

633
00:29:01,364 --> 00:29:02,364
It's melting.

634
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:04,450
You better hurry.

635
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:06,577
- You want it?

636
00:29:10,957 --> 00:29:13,125
- I think I'll have this
next time,

637
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:15,502
'cause my banana was
a little brown at the end.

638
00:29:15,628 --> 00:29:16,628
You want it?

639
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:20,424
- Oh, I'm good.
Thank you.

640
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:27,347
Emilia, how old is that baby?

641
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:31,310
- Excuse me, is your baby
two, three months?

642
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:33,812
- Oh, seven weeks.
December 26th.

643
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:38,358
- Seven weeks,
December 26th.

644
00:29:40,737 --> 00:29:43,989
- Did you know that Isabel
was never really a person?

645
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:47,159
- What?

646
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:50,496
- She was never really a person.

647
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:51,663
In Jewish law,

648
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,165
it says that a baby
is not a person

649
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:56,919
until it's at least
eight days old.

650
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:59,671
And Isabel was only
three days old when she died.

651
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:02,174
So that means she was never
really a person.

652
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,926
- Where did you hear that?

653
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:05,177
- My mother.

654
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:08,263
- I told her I was
a little sad about Isabel,

655
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:11,433
but not as sad as if I've
known her for a long time,

656
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:14,686
like she had time to be
my real little sister.

657
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:17,648
So then my mom told me how,
in the Jewish law,

658
00:30:17,774 --> 00:30:19,191
she was never really a person.

659
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:23,570
So now I don't have to feel
so bad about not feeling so sad.

660
00:30:23,696 --> 00:30:25,280
- Well, Isabel was
a real person.

661
00:30:25,406 --> 00:30:27,199
She was every bit as much
of a person as you are.

662
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:30,202
- My mom said she was surprised
they even let us have a funeral.

663
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:32,329
- We're going.

664
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:36,208
Come on.
Let's go.

665
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:40,462
- Hey, you forgot to pay!

666
00:30:40,588 --> 00:30:43,048
- That was fun,
wasn't it?

667
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:44,299
- Yeah.

668
00:30:44,425 --> 00:30:46,218
- It's good to share things
together,

669
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:48,053
like, you know,
secrets and stuff.

670
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:49,471
It's fun.

671
00:30:49,597 --> 00:30:52,224
- I'm not supposed to have
secrets from my mom.

672
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:55,894
- It's not a secret.
It's just private.

673
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,604
There's a difference.

674
00:30:57,730 --> 00:31:00,440
We can have
private things together.

675
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:02,317
Everyone does.
Like tomorrow.

676
00:31:02,443 --> 00:31:03,902
Tomorrow don't go having
ice cream

677
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:05,696
in front of your dad, okay?

678
00:31:05,822 --> 00:31:07,072
Not that my sister
will have any.

679
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:08,824
She probably only
has the soy stuff.

680
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:10,909
- I don't want to go
to that stupid party.

681
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:12,202
- It's your cousin's birthday.

682
00:31:12,328 --> 00:31:15,581
- No, she's your niece,
not my cousin.

683
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:17,040
- Nono will be there.

684
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:18,500
You like Nono.

685
00:31:18,626 --> 00:31:20,586
You call him your grandpa,
and he isn't, so...

686
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:24,214
- But sometimes
when it's just you and me,

687
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:27,676
we can still get ice cream,
right?

688
00:31:27,802 --> 00:31:29,678
- Only if it's just
between the two of us.

689
00:31:29,804 --> 00:31:31,763
Deal?
- Deal.

690
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:41,690
After the party,
can Emilia and I go to the park?

691
00:31:41,816 --> 00:31:44,943
Maybe go where we went
yesterday, Emilia?

692
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:47,821
- Well, um, okay, William.

693
00:31:47,947 --> 00:31:48,864
Maybe.

694
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:51,325
But be cool, fool.

695
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:54,161
- Uh, totally, dude.

696
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:56,246
- What's with you two?

697
00:31:56,372 --> 00:31:57,623
- Private joke.

698
00:31:57,749 --> 00:31:58,707
- Uh-huh.

699
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:00,834
- Private, not secret.

700
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,419
There's a difference.

701
00:32:02,545 --> 00:32:04,546
- Is there?

702
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:10,093
- Ugh!

703
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:20,979
- Sweet old grandpa routine?

704
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:23,023
I just don't believe it.

705
00:32:23,149 --> 00:32:24,358
- Yeah, well, the kids do.

706
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:27,277
And they usually sniff out
bullshit pretty well.

707
00:32:27,403 --> 00:32:29,613
Oh, hey, your mom called.
She's running late.

708
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:30,864
[horn honking]

709
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:32,783
- Dad, Jack's already waiting.
Go.

710
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:34,242
- Where are they going?

711
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:36,828
- Oh, we ran out of Rice Dream.

712
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:39,247
Hey, kiddo.
You hungry?

713
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:41,333
- No, I had lots already.

714
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:42,793
I love hummus.

715
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:44,544
We made it in school
on Middle Eastern day.

716
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:46,880
Both Arabs and Israelis eat it.

717
00:32:47,006 --> 00:32:48,882
- Yes, it's the hope
of the world, hummus.

718
00:32:49,008 --> 00:32:52,511
- Honey, can you take this
up to the rec room to the kids?

719
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:54,221
Put it on the table
with the cookies.

720
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:56,473
The non-dairy has a cow
with the line through it, okay?

721
00:32:56,599 --> 00:32:58,100
- Do I have to?

722
00:32:58,226 --> 00:33:00,435
I don't know anyone.

723
00:33:00,561 --> 00:33:01,895
- Well, you know Josh and Emma.

724
00:33:02,021 --> 00:33:03,689
Okay, look.

725
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:05,023
If you have no fun,

726
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:06,566
in ten minutes,
you can come back down.

727
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:07,693
That's 1 1:28.

728
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:09,444
There's a digital clock
up there, okay?

729
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:11,530
- I prefer analog.

730
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:13,573
- Okay, now you have to wait
till 1 1:29.

731
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,701
Scoot.

732
00:33:20,707 --> 00:33:23,333
- You look good,
better.

733
00:33:23,459 --> 00:33:25,919
- Better than what?

734
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:35,220
We brought this for Emma.

735
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:37,055
I can't believe
she's five already.

736
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:38,265
- Oh, my God.

737
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:41,476
Developmental K next year,
Greenpoint.

738
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:44,146
They've got this incredible
bilingual program.

739
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:46,523
I can't believe you're taking
William out of his school.

740
00:33:46,649 --> 00:33:47,941
It's so great.

741
00:33:48,067 --> 00:33:49,985
- Yeah, but it's public,
and it's what Jack wants.

742
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:52,487
So now I got to please her.

743
00:33:52,613 --> 00:33:53,655
I bet she'll choose

744
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:55,532
whatever private school
is most expensive.

745
00:33:55,658 --> 00:33:58,118
- Well, I hope
you choose wisely.

746
00:33:58,244 --> 00:33:59,327
Don't get me wrong.

747
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:00,537
I mean, William is a sweet kid,

748
00:34:00,663 --> 00:34:02,456
but he could use
a little rough-and-tumble.

749
00:34:02,582 --> 00:34:04,249
You know what I mean?
- I don't know.

750
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:05,792
It's the East Side,
but it is public.

751
00:34:05,918 --> 00:34:07,794
I mean, there's black
and Asian kids in his class.

752
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,254
Diversity is
one of their things.

753
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,757
- Experiencing rich people
of all colors is not diversity.

754
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:13,884
- We're not rich, Pia.

755
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:16,136
We're comfortable.

756
00:34:16,262 --> 00:34:17,971
- Honey, your doorman
is comfortable.

757
00:34:18,097 --> 00:34:20,015
- Hmm.
- Mommy!

758
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:22,100
Come quick.
It's William.

759
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:23,268
- What?
What's the matter?

760
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:26,188
Is he okay?

761
00:34:26,314 --> 00:34:27,272
William?

762
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:28,440
- He won't move.

763
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:30,150
- William, did you have
an accident?

764
00:34:30,276 --> 00:34:31,485
- Gross.

765
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:32,944
- I think it's diarrhea.

766
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:34,946
- Oh, no.
- Just go away.

767
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:37,199
I don't want you.
I want my dad.

768
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:40,202
Is he here?
- He went to the store.

769
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:41,453
- Then Nono.

770
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:44,289
- No, they went
to get Rice Dream.

771
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:46,374
Oh, no.

772
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:48,001
William, I think this-

773
00:34:48,127 --> 00:34:50,212
- Please, I don't want you.

774
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:51,630
Leave me alone.

775
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:54,925
- Honey, why don't you
give me a shot, okay?

776
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:56,093
You want to go downstairs?

777
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:58,136
I'll take you downstairs.

778
00:34:58,262 --> 00:34:59,971
I'm gonna pop him
in the bath, okay?

779
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:01,139
- Here, let me help you.

780
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:03,183
- Great, get the cake ready.

781
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:05,060
The candles are in the drawer
by the stove.

782
00:35:05,186 --> 00:35:06,269
[whispering]
Don't worry.

783
00:35:06,395 --> 00:35:09,314
Good job, pal.

784
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:19,241
He's upstairs
watching a movie.

785
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:21,368
Fine, just embarrassed.

786
00:35:21,494 --> 00:35:22,911
Some of the kids
made fun of him,

787
00:35:23,037 --> 00:35:25,122
which didn't help.

788
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:27,666
- It's my fault
that he had diarrhea.

789
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:30,043
He's lactose-intolerant,
and I gave him ice cream.

790
00:35:30,169 --> 00:35:31,461
- What?
Why?

791
00:35:31,587 --> 00:35:33,171
- Because I didn't
really believe

792
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:35,006
that he was lactose-intolerant.

793
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:38,510
I thought Carolyn
was just being controlling.

794
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:41,012
I know.
I'm a terrible person.

795
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:42,472
- You're not a terrible person.

796
00:35:42,598 --> 00:35:44,683
You're just not used to kids.
It takes time.

797
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:46,935
- No, you know what it takes?
A kid.

798
00:35:47,061 --> 00:35:49,020
- Em, I didn't mean-

799
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:50,188
- Is that okay?

800
00:35:50,314 --> 00:35:54,025
I'm gonna go to the car.

801
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:08,081
- I told her Mom said
that powder doesn't work for me.

802
00:36:08,207 --> 00:36:09,833
- It doesn't matter, Will.

803
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:13,253
You just won't be
having ice cream again.

804
00:36:13,379 --> 00:36:15,380
So it doesn't matter.

805
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:42,866
- Hey, hey.

806
00:36:42,992 --> 00:36:45,160
I'll take a rain check.

807
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:48,246
I'm kind of beat.

808
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:50,665
- Okay.

809
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:04,596
- Sorry I'm late.

810
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:05,764
Wow, you look nice.

811
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:06,890
Is that new?

812
00:37:07,016 --> 00:37:08,016
- No.
Thank you, honey.

813
00:37:08,142 --> 00:37:09,476
I just had my hair done.

814
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:12,103
Take your time, sweetie.

815
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:14,940
I'm sorry I missed you
yesterday at Pia's.

816
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:16,399
I heard about Will.

817
00:37:16,525 --> 00:37:17,609
Poor baby.

818
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:19,110
- He's better today,

819
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:22,113
but I'm expecting a hysterical
phone call from Carolyn

820
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,365
as soon as he tells her.

821
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:24,950
She's gonna love this.

822
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:27,118
Emilia screws up again.

823
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:29,412
- Well, you couldn't know.
Pia feels terrible.

824
00:37:29,538 --> 00:37:30,705
Six kids, not including Will.

825
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:32,290
That's seven.

826
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:33,541
I'm not surprised they got sick.

827
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:35,377
I'm just surprised
seven kids tried hummus.

828
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:36,795
I mean, she scares them into it.

829
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:38,964
- That's what it was?
- She said she told you.

830
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:41,299
Em, you've got to check
your machine, honestly.

831
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:42,968
- We have to tell him.

832
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:44,469
- Well, what did you
think it was?

833
00:37:46,055 --> 00:37:49,057
[knocking at door]

834
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:53,728
- Hi, I need to speak
to William Woolf, please.

835
00:37:53,854 --> 00:37:55,397
- I'm sorry, how did you-

836
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:57,399
- I'm Emilia Greenleaf.
I'm his stepmother.

837
00:37:57,525 --> 00:37:58,608
It's important.

838
00:37:58,734 --> 00:38:00,110
- I know who you are,
Miss Greenleaf,

839
00:38:00,236 --> 00:38:01,736
but unless it's
a medical emergency,

840
00:38:01,862 --> 00:38:02,988
we don't allow visits.

841
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:04,447
It's distracting.

842
00:38:04,573 --> 00:38:05,991
I can give him a message
at recess.

843
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:09,494
- Okay, tell him six other kids
got sick yesterday,

844
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:10,745
so it wasn't the ice cream.

845
00:38:10,871 --> 00:38:12,497
It was the hummus.

846
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:13,873
- All right.

847
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,917
Not the ice cream.

848
00:38:16,043 --> 00:38:17,085
The hummus.

849
00:38:17,211 --> 00:38:19,004
- It's important.

850
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:21,131
- Have a nice day.

851
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:32,100
- It went okay?
- Yeah, I think.

852
00:38:32,226 --> 00:38:34,060
We'll know if we get
one of her calls.

853
00:38:34,186 --> 00:38:36,855
- Don't let me forget to pick up
something for your father today.

854
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:37,981
His birthday is in a month.

855
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:39,774
- Mom, you should forget
his birthday.

856
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:41,026
It's been seven years.

857
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:42,527
- It doesn't kill me
to buy him a card.

858
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:44,195
- Hallmark has that covered?

859
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:46,239
"Happy birthday.
Thanks for cheating on me."

860
00:38:46,365 --> 00:38:47,574
- Emilia.

861
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:51,119
- I'm worried about you.

862
00:38:51,245 --> 00:38:53,496
Simon is too.

863
00:38:53,622 --> 00:38:55,790
- I'm fine.

864
00:38:55,916 --> 00:38:58,877
- Look, I know
what you're going through.

865
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:01,713
My miscarriage was just like
a child dying.

866
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:02,922
- Really?

867
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:04,549
Then isn't abortion
the same thing too?

868
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:06,009
I mean, I think
there's a difference

869
00:39:06,135 --> 00:39:11,389
between a fetus and a baby.

870
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:14,476
I'm sorry.

871
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:15,894
I'm really sorry, Mindy.

872
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,937
I just-

873
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:20,398
I'm all right, really.

874
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:25,779
Time heals, and I just need
the days to pass for a while.

875
00:39:25,905 --> 00:39:28,865
- No, no, you need to take
an active role

876
00:39:28,991 --> 00:39:30,450
in your own grief.

877
00:39:30,576 --> 00:39:32,744
That's what saved me.

878
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:35,246
I want you to come with us
on the remembrance walk.

879
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:36,915
- What, that thing you did
in November?

880
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:39,459
- Yes, we're doing a small one
next month.

881
00:39:39,585 --> 00:39:42,253
- I don't think that walking
in Central Park

882
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,089
with a bunch of people
with candles

883
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:47,842
who lost their babies
is really gonna help.

884
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:49,135
- You don't know that.
Okay?

885
00:39:49,261 --> 00:39:51,388
it saved my life.

886
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:53,598
- I'm glad.
- Look, here.

887
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:55,767
Just take the pamphlet, okay?

888
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:57,644
If you're not interested,
I'll drop it.

889
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:59,604
But I really think
it would help.

890
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:03,608
And you need help, seriously.

891
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:06,736
- [sighs]

892
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:10,657
- Is she expecting you home
at any particular time?

893
00:40:10,783 --> 00:40:12,784
Will dinner be waiting?

894
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:15,203
- I'm gonna pick up William
early on Friday,

895
00:40:15,329 --> 00:40:18,289
at 3:00 here instead of 5:00
at your place.

896
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:20,417
I got tickets to
The Lion King for Friday night,

897
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:21,960
and I thought we'd make
a day of it.

898
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:23,586
- He's already seen
The Lion King.

899
00:40:23,712 --> 00:40:25,296
- He can see it twice.

900
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:28,550
- We hear from the schools
on Friday.

901
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:30,009
- Great.

902
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:31,678
Call me,
let me know where he's going.

903
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:34,097
- I'd like to tell him myself.

904
00:40:34,223 --> 00:40:36,391
William and I went through
the whole process together.

905
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:38,017
I went on all
the interviews with him.

906
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:40,311
I really think I should be
the one who tells him.

907
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:42,105
- Fine.

908
00:40:42,231 --> 00:40:44,107
You can tell him.

909
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:48,403
- William and I chose
Collegiate together,

910
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:51,197
and when he gets in,
we will celebrate together.

911
00:40:51,323 --> 00:40:53,658
He knows the letters
are coming on Friday.

912
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:55,827
He'll be waiting to find out.
- Then meet us here.

913
00:40:55,953 --> 00:40:57,328
Or wait till Monday.

914
00:40:57,455 --> 00:41:00,290
Either way,
I'm picking him up early.

915
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:03,001
- You realize the message
you're sending.

916
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:04,544
- And what would that be,
Carolyn?

917
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:08,465
- Mr. Woolf, Dr. Soule.

918
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:10,008
- Miss Johnson,
thank you so much

919
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:11,551
for rescheduling
this appointment.

920
00:41:11,677 --> 00:41:13,011
- It really would be much easier

921
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:15,013
if we didn't both have
to be here at the same time.

922
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:16,681
- Well, it's our policy,
when possible.

923
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:19,559
Now, before I walk you through
William's evaluation-

924
00:41:19,685 --> 00:41:20,894
- What are those?

925
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:23,021
- Oh, aren't they lovely?

926
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:25,523
We're doing a unit
on family structure.

927
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:27,650
The children all drew pictures
of their families.

928
00:41:27,776 --> 00:41:29,027
We're so lucky to have such-

929
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:30,403
- Where's William's?

930
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:37,494
- William,
in particular, um,

931
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:40,497
found this
to be very helpful with...

932
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:49,339
It's how kids process things.

933
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:52,133
- Carolyn-

934
00:41:52,259 --> 00:41:53,551
- Dr. Soule, please.

935
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:55,929
- This is not his family.

936
00:41:56,055 --> 00:41:57,847
- What are you doing?

937
00:41:57,973 --> 00:41:59,224
- This is my classroom.

938
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:01,809
I will not allow you to destroy
things in my classroom.

939
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:02,977
- May I?

940
00:42:03,103 --> 00:42:04,938
- That is not his family, Jack.

941
00:42:05,064 --> 00:42:06,439
- It is now.

942
00:42:20,996 --> 00:42:23,248
I'm sorry.

943
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:25,124
We should just move on
with the evaluation.

944
00:42:25,251 --> 00:42:29,879
I'll tell my wife.

945
00:42:30,005 --> 00:42:31,172
My ex-wife.

946
00:43:44,538 --> 00:43:45,663
- I hate that one.

947
00:43:49,168 --> 00:43:51,544
It's the last one we took.

948
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:54,589
- I didn't realize
you'd seen these.

949
00:43:54,715 --> 00:43:57,842
I'm...

950
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:12,899
- This is my favorite.

951
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:15,068
I framed it.

952
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:16,611
- I look terrible.

953
00:44:16,737 --> 00:44:18,071
I'm all blotchy.

954
00:44:18,197 --> 00:44:23,034
- You look like a woman
who just had a baby.

955
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:26,621
- You aren't mad at me?

956
00:44:26,747 --> 00:44:28,956
- What for?

957
00:44:29,083 --> 00:44:31,417
- For stealing the pictures
and getting them printed

958
00:44:31,543 --> 00:44:33,211
and not telling you

959
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:35,254
and hiding them here?

960
00:44:35,381 --> 00:44:37,048
- You think I'd forget
we'd taken them?

961
00:44:37,174 --> 00:44:40,301
I just ordered another set

962
00:44:40,427 --> 00:44:42,762
and had them delivered
to the office.

963
00:44:42,888 --> 00:44:44,889
This one's on my desk.

964
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:52,563
Of course I'm not mad.

965
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:56,442
- You should be.

966
00:44:56,568 --> 00:44:58,903
- I'm not.

967
00:45:06,286 --> 00:45:07,829
Not my favorite.

968
00:45:07,955 --> 00:45:10,415
She's got that Popeye thing
going on.

969
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:12,709
One eye open, one eye closed.

970
00:45:12,835 --> 00:45:14,877
- You look nice.

971
00:45:15,003 --> 00:45:18,548
You look happy.

972
00:45:18,674 --> 00:45:21,759
- I was.

973
00:45:21,885 --> 00:45:24,429
The day Isabel was born
and the day William was born

974
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:26,264
were the happiest days
of my life.

975
00:45:33,981 --> 00:45:37,817
Can you meet me tomorrow
at Will's school?

976
00:45:37,943 --> 00:45:39,986
I want to show you something.

977
00:45:40,112 --> 00:45:41,779
- Okay.

978
00:45:41,905 --> 00:45:43,281
- A surprise.

979
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:45,408
- Yeah.

980
00:45:52,124 --> 00:45:55,126
- [sighs]

981
00:46:00,674 --> 00:46:03,676
[kids chattering]

982
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:17,273
- Hello.

983
00:46:17,399 --> 00:46:18,566
- Yes.

984
00:46:18,692 --> 00:46:21,027
- Carolyn, I don't know
if you remember me.

985
00:46:21,153 --> 00:46:22,862
- I know who you are.
Is Jack inside?

986
00:46:22,988 --> 00:46:25,281
- Yeah, he'll be down
in a minute.

987
00:46:25,407 --> 00:46:28,659
- All right.

988
00:46:28,786 --> 00:46:29,994
This is all your fault.

989
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:33,581
Will has been so distracted
and tense and emotional.

990
00:46:33,707 --> 00:46:35,833
I'm sure they sensed that
in the interviews.

991
00:46:35,959 --> 00:46:37,335
- What?

992
00:46:37,461 --> 00:46:39,670
- You just won't be happy
until you've ruined everything.

993
00:46:39,797 --> 00:46:41,297
I don't know what the hell
happened to you

994
00:46:41,423 --> 00:46:42,507
to make you so destructive.

995
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:44,801
Jack.

996
00:46:44,927 --> 00:46:46,052
He didn't get in.

997
00:46:46,178 --> 00:46:49,055
- He didn't get in?
- No, uh-uh.

998
00:46:49,181 --> 00:46:51,098
Not Collegiate,
not even wait-listed.

999
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:52,558
- All right, just calm down,
Carolyn.

1000
00:46:52,684 --> 00:46:54,435
- Oh, I'm calm.
Would you like me to not care?

1001
00:46:54,561 --> 00:46:55,603
Should I be more like you?

1002
00:46:55,729 --> 00:46:56,854
- Well, he can always stay here.

1003
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:58,356
I mean, it's not the end
of the world.

1004
00:46:58,482 --> 00:47:00,233
- No, it's certainly
not the end of your world.

1005
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:01,317
You don't give a shit.

1006
00:47:01,443 --> 00:47:02,527
But it's a disaster for Will.

1007
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:03,736
He didn't get in anywhere.

1008
00:47:03,862 --> 00:47:05,863
Not Collegiate, not Dalton,
not Trinity.

1009
00:47:05,989 --> 00:47:07,532
- You know what?
This is not the time.

1010
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:09,283
- Not the U.N.
international school.

1011
00:47:09,409 --> 00:47:10,368
Do you know where he got in?

1012
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:11,994
Do you know who took him?
West Side Prep.

1013
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:13,538
- That's a great school.

1014
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:15,915
Will, that's great, really.
- It's his safety school, Jack.

1015
00:47:16,041 --> 00:47:17,375
Do you know
what a safety school is?

1016
00:47:17,501 --> 00:47:18,543
- Yeah, I do.

1017
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:20,002
- Jack, I'm gonna
take William home.

1018
00:47:20,128 --> 00:47:21,212
We'll meet you there.

1019
00:47:21,338 --> 00:47:22,588
Should I go to the theater?
- No.

1020
00:47:22,714 --> 00:47:23,881
- Home.
I'll meet you at home.

1021
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:27,134
Don't worry, Will, okay?

1022
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:28,386
- You don't care.

1023
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:29,971
You don't fucking-
- Of course I care.

1024
00:47:30,097 --> 00:47:31,514
- Don't touch me.

1025
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:33,057
- Okay, just calm down,
all right?

1026
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:35,184
- You're really too old
for The Lion King, anyway.

1027
00:47:35,310 --> 00:47:36,602
I mean,
it's pretty unscientific.

1028
00:47:36,728 --> 00:47:37,728
Talking lions?

1029
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:39,146
Talking lion puppets,
actually.

1030
00:47:39,273 --> 00:47:42,733
You dodged a bullet,
my friend.

1031
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:46,696
You want something to drink?

1032
00:47:46,822 --> 00:47:48,739
Hey, easy.
We're walking through the park.

1033
00:47:48,866 --> 00:47:50,324
Your mom hates
the bathrooms there.

1034
00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:52,451
- I can pee on a tree.

1035
00:47:52,578 --> 00:47:54,245
I have a penis.

1036
00:47:54,371 --> 00:47:55,746
You're the one
who should be worried.

1037
00:47:55,873 --> 00:47:56,914
You don't have one.

1038
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,332
- Thank you
for clearing that up.

1039
00:47:58,458 --> 00:47:59,792
I can stop looking now.

1040
00:47:59,918 --> 00:48:01,919
- Come on, hurry up!

1041
00:48:02,045 --> 00:48:05,882
- Hey, um,

1042
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:08,259
do you skate?

1043
00:48:08,385 --> 00:48:10,761
- It's just wrong.

1044
00:48:10,888 --> 00:48:12,930
We should rent helmets.

1045
00:48:13,056 --> 00:48:14,515
Rollerbladers need helmets,

1046
00:48:14,641 --> 00:48:17,810
and ice is just as hard
as asphalt.

1047
00:48:17,936 --> 00:48:19,061
Harder.

1048
00:48:19,187 --> 00:48:20,938
- Ice is not as hard
as asphalt.

1049
00:48:21,064 --> 00:48:23,357
- Yes, it is.
Much harder.

1050
00:48:23,483 --> 00:48:25,776
Actually,
asphalt is quite soft.

1051
00:48:25,903 --> 00:48:28,112
That's why my mom runs
in the street

1052
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:29,447
and not the sidewalk.

1053
00:48:29,573 --> 00:48:30,865
She knows that kind of thing.

1054
00:48:30,991 --> 00:48:31,991
She's a doctor.

1055
00:48:32,117 --> 00:48:34,368
- Does she run with a helmet?

1056
00:48:34,494 --> 00:48:36,162
You should mention that to her.

1057
00:48:36,288 --> 00:48:39,457
- My pediatrician's office
has a safety wall in it.

1058
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:42,627
It has a picture of children
on their rollerblades.

1059
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:43,878
My picture is there too.

1060
00:48:44,004 --> 00:48:47,006
I'm on my tricycle
wearing my blue helmet.

1061
00:48:47,132 --> 00:48:49,133
I also have a red helmet.

1062
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:50,551
If we really want to do this,

1063
00:48:50,677 --> 00:48:52,720
we can go home
and get one of my helmets.

1064
00:48:52,846 --> 00:48:55,097
- Oy, with the helmets.

1065
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:59,769
- It looks bigger
than 33,000 square feet.

1066
00:48:59,895 --> 00:49:01,812
- How do you know
how big Wollman Rink is?

1067
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:03,397
- It's in that book you gave me,

1068
00:49:03,523 --> 00:49:05,316
you know,
the Central Park book?

1069
00:49:05,442 --> 00:49:06,692
- Oh.

1070
00:49:06,818 --> 00:49:08,903
I didn't know you read it.

1071
00:49:09,029 --> 00:49:11,572
Pretty cool, huh?

1072
00:49:11,698 --> 00:49:16,160
Come on.
Hat.

1073
00:49:17,996 --> 00:49:20,247
- Watch out!

1074
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:22,083
- See?

1075
00:49:22,209 --> 00:49:25,086
- At the speed he's going,
he needs one.

1076
00:49:25,212 --> 00:49:27,588
- This is very scary.
- No, it's not.

1077
00:49:27,714 --> 00:49:28,798
- Yes, it is.

1078
00:49:28,924 --> 00:49:30,341
You can't say
what's scary to me.

1079
00:49:30,467 --> 00:49:32,134
Only I can.

1080
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:34,762
You're not scared,
because you know how to skate.

1081
00:49:34,888 --> 00:49:36,180
And that boy's not scared,

1082
00:49:36,306 --> 00:49:38,265
because his mother
brought his helmet.

1083
00:49:38,392 --> 00:49:42,019
- Which probably means
he's scared of her.

1084
00:49:42,145 --> 00:49:43,312
Here, give me your hand.

1085
00:49:43,438 --> 00:49:45,106
Good.

1086
00:49:45,232 --> 00:49:46,565
This isn't so awful, is it?

1087
00:49:46,692 --> 00:49:49,026
- I just want to go back
to the wall.

1088
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:50,319
That was much better.

1089
00:49:50,445 --> 00:49:51,862
- You just need
to get used to it.

1090
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:53,280
- No, you just go skate.

1091
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:57,159
I do better
if no one is watching.

1092
00:49:57,285 --> 00:49:59,578
- Okay, I'm gonna
go around once,

1093
00:49:59,705 --> 00:50:01,455
and you try and balance, okay?

1094
00:50:01,581 --> 00:50:03,207
- Go on.

1095
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:06,085
- Okay.

1096
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:32,445
- Whoa, whoa!

1097
00:50:33,613 --> 00:50:34,780
- William!

1098
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:37,408
William, just stay right there.

1099
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:39,493
I'll help you get up, okay?

1100
00:50:39,619 --> 00:50:40,703
- I'm good.

1101
00:50:40,829 --> 00:50:42,246
- Whoa!

1102
00:50:42,372 --> 00:50:43,581
Shit.

1103
00:50:43,707 --> 00:50:47,877
If you say "helmet,"
I'm gonna leave you here.

1104
00:50:48,003 --> 00:50:49,086
- Wrist pad.

1105
00:50:49,212 --> 00:50:53,090
- Come on.

1106
00:50:53,216 --> 00:50:54,592
Okay, let's go.

1107
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:56,719
- Whoa!
- Are you kidding me?

1108
00:51:00,515 --> 00:51:02,975
- It's just,
Collegiate was the best school.

1109
00:51:03,101 --> 00:51:04,310
- No, it isn't.

1110
00:51:04,436 --> 00:51:06,103
It's snooty.

1111
00:51:06,229 --> 00:51:07,521
Plus, Collegiate is all boys.

1112
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:10,357
Who wants to go
to an all-boys school?

1113
00:51:10,484 --> 00:51:13,235
- Well, if you go to Collegiate,
you can go to Harvard.

1114
00:51:13,361 --> 00:51:15,696
- A: not guaranteed.

1115
00:51:15,822 --> 00:51:18,949
B: West Side Prep sends
tons of boys to Harvard.

1116
00:51:19,076 --> 00:51:21,035
And C: you're eight.

1117
00:51:21,161 --> 00:51:22,620
You don't have to think
about Harvard.

1118
00:51:22,746 --> 00:51:23,746
Harvard sucks.

1119
00:51:23,872 --> 00:51:25,414
- You went to Harvard.

1120
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:26,665
- Exactly.

1121
00:51:26,792 --> 00:51:29,418
- Well, that's true.

1122
00:51:29,544 --> 00:51:34,590
But still,
I thought I'd get in.

1123
00:51:34,716 --> 00:51:36,300
- Dude, it doesn't matter.

1124
00:51:36,426 --> 00:51:38,469
It really doesn't matter.

1125
00:51:38,595 --> 00:51:41,138
- My mom is mad at me.

1126
00:51:41,264 --> 00:51:43,933
- She's mad,
but not at you.

1127
00:51:44,059 --> 00:51:46,685
She's mad at me and at your dad
and everything,

1128
00:51:46,812 --> 00:51:49,772
but it only feels like
she's mad at you.

1129
00:51:49,898 --> 00:51:53,526
- You don't understand.

1130
00:51:53,652 --> 00:51:55,986
You don't understand
about Collegiate or anything.

1131
00:51:56,113 --> 00:51:57,363
You're from New Rochelle.

1132
00:51:57,489 --> 00:51:59,782
You not sophisticated
like me and my mom are.

1133
00:51:59,908 --> 00:52:03,494
- You're feeling better, huh?

1134
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:05,162
You know what we're gonna do?

1135
00:52:05,288 --> 00:52:07,123
We're gonna stop at Fairway
on the way home,

1136
00:52:07,249 --> 00:52:10,417
and I'm going to make you
a homemade stir-fry

1137
00:52:10,544 --> 00:52:11,669
and Tofutti sundaes,

1138
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:12,837
and we're gonna watch a movie

1139
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:14,713
that will shrivel
your young brain.

1140
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:18,342
How's that sound?

1141
00:52:18,468 --> 00:52:20,970
- Only if I can let go
of the wall down there.

1142
00:52:21,096 --> 00:52:22,263
- You don't have to.

1143
00:52:22,389 --> 00:52:26,267
- Only if I can let go
of the wall.

1144
00:52:26,393 --> 00:52:28,018
- Right on.

1145
00:52:28,145 --> 00:52:29,353
One more try.

1146
00:52:58,717 --> 00:52:59,842
- This is done?

1147
00:52:59,968 --> 00:53:01,051
What next?

1148
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:03,804
- You can peel the ginger.

1149
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:05,347
We only need this part
like that.

1150
00:53:05,473 --> 00:53:06,599
- Okay, just that?
That's it?

1151
00:53:06,725 --> 00:53:09,101
- Just the skin off.
Not too much.

1152
00:53:09,227 --> 00:53:11,103
We don't need that much.
- Okay, but like this?

1153
00:53:11,229 --> 00:53:12,479
- Uh-uh, just the corner,
though.

1154
00:53:12,606 --> 00:53:14,106
- All right.

1155
00:53:14,232 --> 00:53:15,482
- Hey.

1156
00:53:15,609 --> 00:53:17,610
- Dad, hey.

1157
00:53:17,736 --> 00:53:18,736
- Hey.

1158
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:20,279
I'm sorry about The Lion King.

1159
00:53:20,405 --> 00:53:21,488
- It's okay.

1160
00:53:21,615 --> 00:53:23,282
- I'm so proud of you.

1161
00:53:23,408 --> 00:53:26,827
You got into a great school.

1162
00:53:26,953 --> 00:53:29,914
- What does Mom say?

1163
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:32,791
- She says you're gonna
love it there.

1164
00:53:32,918 --> 00:53:35,002
And she's very happy.

1165
00:53:35,128 --> 00:53:36,128
- Right.

1166
00:53:36,254 --> 00:53:38,088
- Hey, Will, show your dad
the flyer.

1167
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:40,966
- Oh, there's a movie
in the park.

1168
00:53:41,092 --> 00:53:43,093
It's Lyle, Lyle, Crocodile.

1169
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:46,096
That was my favorite book
when I was a kid.

1170
00:53:46,223 --> 00:53:47,264
Remember?

1171
00:53:47,390 --> 00:53:48,515
- Uh, yeah, a long time ago.

1172
00:53:48,642 --> 00:53:50,226
But yeah, I kind of remember.

1173
00:53:50,352 --> 00:53:52,102
- Yeah, they're shooting
a scene at the zoo,

1174
00:53:52,229 --> 00:53:53,646
and they need kid extras.

1175
00:53:53,772 --> 00:53:56,732
- Both Emilia and I
can be in it.

1176
00:53:56,858 --> 00:53:58,901
I can be a kid,
and Emilia can be a mom.

1177
00:53:59,027 --> 00:54:01,403
- And it was my favorite book
too when I was your age,

1178
00:54:01,529 --> 00:54:02,863
which is pretty weird.

1179
00:54:02,989 --> 00:54:04,865
- Meant to be.

1180
00:54:04,991 --> 00:54:06,492
So what's all this?

1181
00:54:06,618 --> 00:54:09,662
- Well, Will wanted
a real stir-fry, not takeout.

1182
00:54:09,788 --> 00:54:10,829
- Mm-hmm.
- Jump in.

1183
00:54:10,956 --> 00:54:11,956
- Sure.

1184
00:54:12,082 --> 00:54:13,332
- You got to wash
your hands first.

1185
00:54:13,458 --> 00:54:15,376
And you have to sing
Happy Birthday twice

1186
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:17,628
while you're doing it.

1187
00:54:17,754 --> 00:54:19,922
Otherwise you don't kill
all the bacteria.

1188
00:54:20,048 --> 00:54:21,423
- Got it.

1189
00:54:21,549 --> 00:54:23,884
- Hey, Will, why don't you show
your dad the DVDs we got today?

1190
00:54:24,010 --> 00:54:26,262
- Oh, they're in my room.

1191
00:54:26,388 --> 00:54:27,638
I already previewed them.

1192
00:54:27,764 --> 00:54:29,306
I want to start
with Jurassic Park.

1193
00:54:29,432 --> 00:54:33,435
- Jurassic Park?

1194
00:54:33,561 --> 00:54:35,145
[sighs]

1195
00:54:35,272 --> 00:54:36,397
Not the day I planned.

1196
00:54:36,523 --> 00:54:38,399
- Carolyn's insane.

1197
00:54:38,525 --> 00:54:43,153
She needs a Valium drip
or patch...or four.

1198
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:45,364
- I guess it's the hormones
or something.

1199
00:54:45,490 --> 00:54:47,074
I mean,
first there were the shots,

1200
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:50,494
and now that she's...

1201
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:52,788
Oh.

1202
00:54:52,914 --> 00:54:54,498
Carolyn's pregnant.

1203
00:54:54,624 --> 00:54:57,751
- Carolyn's-
oh, shit!

1204
00:54:57,877 --> 00:55:01,797
- You okay?

1205
00:55:01,923 --> 00:55:03,674
- Carolyn's pregnant?

1206
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:04,800
How can she be pregnant?

1207
00:55:04,926 --> 00:55:06,343
She's 43.

1208
00:55:06,469 --> 00:55:09,680
- Well, she's 42, but she's been
seeing someone since summer.

1209
00:55:09,806 --> 00:55:11,807
- No, she hasn't.
Will would have told us.

1210
00:55:11,933 --> 00:55:14,226
- Well, he told me, and he
doesn't know about the baby.

1211
00:55:14,352 --> 00:55:15,811
She wanted to wait
until she passed

1212
00:55:15,937 --> 00:55:17,563
the three-month mark
to tell him.

1213
00:55:17,689 --> 00:55:18,772
- How pregnant is she?

1214
00:55:18,898 --> 00:55:21,025
- I don't know,
seven, eight weeks.

1215
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:23,861
Something like that.

1216
00:55:23,987 --> 00:55:28,032
She told me
when we lost Isabel.

1217
00:55:28,158 --> 00:55:30,242
It made her realize
that she wanted another child.

1218
00:55:30,368 --> 00:55:33,579
She got pregnant right away.

1219
00:55:33,705 --> 00:55:36,290
- She got pregnant
because of Isabel?

1220
00:55:36,416 --> 00:55:41,295
Your ex-wife got pregnant
because my baby died?

1221
00:55:41,421 --> 00:55:45,257
- Not because she died.

1222
00:55:45,383 --> 00:55:48,886
Because she saw
how much we loved her.

1223
00:55:51,264 --> 00:55:53,974
Emilia, this is a good thing,

1224
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:58,395
like something good
came out of Isabel's death.

1225
00:55:58,521 --> 00:55:59,605
She didn't die in vain.

1226
00:55:59,731 --> 00:56:02,566
- That is not why she died,

1227
00:56:02,692 --> 00:56:04,568
so that Carolyn
could have another baby.

1228
00:56:04,694 --> 00:56:06,653
- No, you don't understand.
- Oh, fuck you!

1229
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:09,031
That is not why she died.
That's not a good enough reason.

1230
00:56:09,157 --> 00:56:10,199
- Will.

1231
00:56:10,325 --> 00:56:12,618
[doors slam]

1232
00:56:12,744 --> 00:56:17,456
Oh, fuck.

1233
00:56:17,582 --> 00:56:20,209
- Oh, a good movie
always makes me feel better.

1234
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:22,836
- What's with you?

1235
00:56:22,962 --> 00:56:25,255
- What do you mean?
- You seem happy.

1236
00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:27,466
- Do I?
I'm not.

1237
00:56:27,592 --> 00:56:29,051
I mean, I'm the same.

1238
00:56:29,177 --> 00:56:31,512
I liked that movie, though.
Didn't you?

1239
00:56:31,638 --> 00:56:33,639
- No.

1240
00:56:33,765 --> 00:56:35,557
I hate it when the heroine
is beautiful,

1241
00:56:35,683 --> 00:56:37,101
but she can't get a date.

1242
00:56:37,227 --> 00:56:39,186
Why does everything
have to be so stupid?

1243
00:56:39,312 --> 00:56:43,732
- Oh, sweetie, I know.

1244
00:56:43,858 --> 00:56:45,109
But you'll feel better.

1245
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:47,778
It'll take time,
but it will happen

1246
00:56:47,904 --> 00:56:49,446
at home with Jack.

1247
00:56:49,572 --> 00:56:52,116
I really think I'm gonna
have to kick you out tomorrow.

1248
00:56:52,242 --> 00:56:54,451
24 hours is enough time
to punish a man

1249
00:56:54,577 --> 00:56:56,120
for his ex-wife
getting pregnant.

1250
00:56:56,246 --> 00:56:57,955
- Why did you like that movie?
It's a romance.

1251
00:56:58,081 --> 00:57:00,791
You should have been
angry at it.

1252
00:57:00,917 --> 00:57:03,627
The guy's a creep,
and then he says "sorry."

1253
00:57:03,753 --> 00:57:08,674
And then everyone forgives him,
but people aren't like that.

1254
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:10,300
- Some people are.

1255
00:57:10,427 --> 00:57:12,719
Sometimes good things happen.

1256
00:57:12,846 --> 00:57:14,638
- Did you meet someone?

1257
00:57:14,764 --> 00:57:17,766
Is that what this
little black dress is about?

1258
00:57:17,892 --> 00:57:21,228
- No.
I have not met anyone.

1259
00:57:21,354 --> 00:57:22,896
No one new, anyway.

1260
00:57:23,022 --> 00:57:24,773
- Oh, my God.

1261
00:57:24,899 --> 00:57:26,108
Mr. Benvenuti.

1262
00:57:26,234 --> 00:57:27,317
When we drove out today,

1263
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:30,737
he was chopping wood
all show-offy.

1264
00:57:30,864 --> 00:57:32,030
Mama, his wife just died.

1265
00:57:32,157 --> 00:57:36,577
- It's not Mr. Benvenuti.

1266
00:57:36,703 --> 00:57:38,328
Emilia, you're not
gonna believe this,

1267
00:57:38,455 --> 00:57:41,123
but I spent some time
with your father Thursday night.

1268
00:57:41,249 --> 00:57:42,958
- What?

1269
00:57:43,084 --> 00:57:45,085
- Well, we've been talking more
since your wedding,

1270
00:57:45,211 --> 00:57:49,006
and I guess you could say
we had a first date.

1271
00:57:49,132 --> 00:57:51,592
- Mom, why do you think
he's changed?

1272
00:57:51,718 --> 00:57:52,676
He has not changed.

1273
00:57:52,802 --> 00:57:54,052
- I don't think he's changed.

1274
00:57:54,179 --> 00:57:55,929
I think there's just as much
and as little to him

1275
00:57:56,055 --> 00:57:57,306
as there always was.

1276
00:57:57,432 --> 00:57:59,391
- You're just gonna pretend
like nothing happened?

1277
00:57:59,517 --> 00:58:01,351
- No, I'm gonna stop pretending

1278
00:58:01,478 --> 00:58:04,980
that was the only thing
about him.

1279
00:58:05,106 --> 00:58:08,525
- You're on your own,
both of you.

1280
00:58:08,651 --> 00:58:09,693
Enjoy yourself.

1281
00:58:09,819 --> 00:58:14,072
- Emilia.

1282
00:58:14,199 --> 00:58:15,491
[sighs]

1283
00:58:49,859 --> 00:58:51,276
- Sonia, I thought
this was my day.

1284
00:58:51,402 --> 00:58:53,070
- Dr. Soule said
she was going to call you.

1285
00:58:53,196 --> 00:58:55,072
- No, no, Sonia.
No, don't talk to her.

1286
00:58:55,198 --> 00:58:56,698
No, can you move away, please?

1287
00:58:56,824 --> 00:58:59,535
William, wait in the car.
- Carolyn, this is my day.

1288
00:58:59,661 --> 00:59:01,912
- Oh, no, you don't have
any more days, Emilia.

1289
00:59:02,038 --> 00:59:03,497
I've just spoken
to the principal.

1290
00:59:03,623 --> 00:59:05,207
If Jack wants to pick him up,
that's fine.

1291
00:59:05,333 --> 00:59:06,583
Otherwise, it's Sonia.

1292
00:59:06,709 --> 00:59:08,710
- Well, I don't know
what William told you, but-

1293
00:59:08,836 --> 00:59:11,421
- My pregnancy is my business,
not yours.

1294
00:59:11,548 --> 00:59:14,049
- Well, then maybe
you shouldn't have told Jack.

1295
00:59:14,175 --> 00:59:15,717
- I'm only six weeks along.

1296
00:59:15,843 --> 00:59:17,094
Anything could happen.

1297
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:18,428
He'd be crushed.

1298
00:59:18,555 --> 00:59:20,305
Not that it would make
any difference to you.

1299
00:59:20,431 --> 00:59:22,266
It's very clear
you don't care about him.

1300
00:59:22,392 --> 00:59:23,934
- That's not true.

1301
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:26,979
I like William very much.

1302
00:59:27,105 --> 00:59:29,064
- Not enough to make sure
he's wearing a helmet

1303
00:59:29,190 --> 00:59:30,315
when he's skating.

1304
00:59:30,441 --> 00:59:34,486
Not enough to take
his food allergy seriously.

1305
00:59:34,612 --> 00:59:36,947
Yes, that's right.
I heard about that, Emilia.

1306
00:59:37,073 --> 00:59:38,615
Maybe it's subconscious,

1307
00:59:38,741 --> 00:59:40,784
but it's obvious
you wish he weren't here.

1308
00:59:40,910 --> 00:59:42,703
- Now you're just
being paranoid.

1309
00:59:42,829 --> 00:59:44,204
- Oh, am I?
Am I?

1310
00:59:44,330 --> 00:59:47,082
Because I've never had anything
to fear from you, right?

1311
00:59:47,208 --> 00:59:49,293
You're so innocent,
so well-intentioned,

1312
00:59:49,419 --> 00:59:51,545
such a safe young woman
to invite into my home.

1313
00:59:51,671 --> 00:59:54,840
You have no right
to see Will alone.

1314
00:59:54,966 --> 00:59:56,800
I'm going to take care
of that legally.

1315
00:59:56,926 --> 00:59:59,052
Your relationship is
with his father, not him.

1316
00:59:59,178 --> 01:00:00,304
- But I'm his stepmother.

1317
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:02,347
- That's nothing,
less than nothing.

1318
01:00:02,473 --> 01:00:04,766
And if you ever hurt him again,
so help me God,

1319
01:00:04,892 --> 01:00:06,518
I will have you arrested
for child abuse.

1320
01:00:06,644 --> 01:00:08,562
- Dr. Soule, please.

1321
01:00:08,688 --> 01:00:10,314
- Children aren't safe
around you, Emilia.

1322
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:11,607
I think we've proven that.

1323
01:00:11,733 --> 01:00:13,775
Stay away from mine.

1324
01:00:13,901 --> 01:00:16,903
Let's go.
Come on.

1325
01:00:22,785 --> 01:00:24,620
- No, Carolyn, Carolyn.

1326
01:00:24,746 --> 01:00:28,332
Are you serious?
No, absolutely not.

1327
01:00:28,458 --> 01:00:30,584
She does not.

1328
01:00:30,710 --> 01:00:31,918
Okay, you know what?
I'm done.

1329
01:00:32,045 --> 01:00:33,253
That's it.

1330
01:00:33,379 --> 01:00:34,713
You don't have to like it.

1331

That's the agreement.

1332
01:00:36,132 --> 01:00:38,133
Well, luckily,
it's not up to you.

1333
01:00:38,259 --> 01:00:39,301
Yeah, okay, great.

1334
01:00:39,427 --> 01:00:40,761
Good luck with that.

1335
01:00:40,887 --> 01:00:43,180
Yeah, bye.

1336
01:00:43,306 --> 01:00:44,848
- Guess you've heard.

1337
01:00:44,974 --> 01:00:48,143
- Yeah, I heard.

1338
01:00:48,269 --> 01:00:50,145
- She's gonna go to court.

1339
01:00:50,271 --> 01:00:51,521
- No, she's not gonna
go to court.

1340
01:00:51,648 --> 01:00:53,315
You're gonna pick him up
every Wednesday,

1341
01:00:53,441 --> 01:00:55,233
same as before,
and take a cab here.

1342
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:57,235
- Okay.

1343
01:00:57,362 --> 01:00:58,820
- And he's coming Saturday

1344
01:00:58,946 --> 01:01:01,782
to the remembrance walk
with us,

1345
01:01:01,908 --> 01:01:02,991
the three of us.

1346
01:01:03,117 --> 01:01:04,618
- How do you know about that?

1347
01:01:04,744 --> 01:01:06,286
- Your mother told me.

1348
01:01:06,412 --> 01:01:07,871
Mindy called her.

1349
01:01:07,997 --> 01:01:09,790
I would like us all to go.

1350
01:01:09,916 --> 01:01:12,584
- Look, I don't even know
if I want to go.

1351
01:01:12,710 --> 01:01:14,544
So he certainly doesn't have to.

1352
01:01:14,671 --> 01:01:16,046
- Yes, he does.

1353
01:01:16,172 --> 01:01:17,506
She was his sister.

1354
01:01:17,632 --> 01:01:18,715
We're all going.

1355

If Carolyn has to buy it,
so do you.

1357
01:01:22,553 --> 01:01:25,180
- Jack, I didn't tell him
on purpose.

1358
01:01:25,306 --> 01:01:27,349
He overheard both of us.

1359
01:01:27,475 --> 01:01:28,558
This isn't my fault.

1360
01:01:28,685 --> 01:01:30,435
- Oh, I know.
Nothing is your fault, right?

1361
01:01:30,561 --> 01:01:33,605
- What's that supposed to mean?

1362
01:01:33,731 --> 01:01:36,733
- Nothing.

1363
01:01:36,859 --> 01:01:40,112
Everything just happens, right?

1364
01:01:41,864 --> 01:01:44,700
Everything just fucking happens.

- 12/27?

1391
01:03:30,348 --> 01:03:32,224
- That's my stepson's name.

1392
01:03:32,350 --> 01:03:34,017
- I love that name.

1393

We called him Billy.

1394
01:03:35,728 --> 01:03:36,812
He died of SIDS.

- I'm sorry.

1396

- I know Billy's here

Don't you feel that
about Isabel?

1417
01:04:33,870 --> 01:04:36,788
- No, I did
when he called last week.

1418
01:04:36,914 --> 01:04:38,206
- He invited me.

1419
01:04:38,332 --> 01:04:40,083
I found out your mother
was going.

1420

I can go get some more
with Nono.

1427

- Thank you.

1428
01:04:57,226 --> 01:05:00,270
- You okay?

1429
01:05:00,396 --> 01:05:02,314
- Welcome, everyone,
to this special walk

1430
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:03,815
for remembrance and hope.

1431

If you happen to lose your group
for any reason,

1432
01:05:06,569 --> 01:05:09,279
you'll be able to find us
at our destination.

1433
01:05:09,405 --> 01:05:12,365
We try to observe silence
during the walk until the end.

1434
01:05:12,491 --> 01:05:13,992
- Hey.
Hey, Jack.

I know this is hard,
but it'll be worth it.

01:06:15,471 --> 01:06:16,638
- Emilia.

1450
01:06:20,643 --> 01:06:23,478
- [humming and laughing]

1451
01:06:23,604 --> 01:06:24,980
- What are you doing?

1452
01:06:25,106 --> 01:06:27,315
- We're practicing
our dance steps for the movie.

1453
01:06:27,441 --> 01:06:28,566
I'm gonna be Lyle.

1454
01:06:28,693 --> 01:06:30,735
- Remember how you and I
used to dance like Lyle

1455
01:06:30,861 --> 01:06:32,404
and Signor Valenti
when you were little?

1456
01:06:32,530 --> 01:06:34,364
- They're gonna start soon.
I think we should go.

1457
01:06:34,490 --> 01:06:35,615
- Right, right.

1458
01:06:35,741 --> 01:06:37,575
I think I might be
in this Lyle movie too, huh?

1459
01:06:37,702 --> 01:06:39,035
If they need
an old grandpa type.

1460
01:06:39,161 --> 01:06:41,037
- You're not a grandpa type.

1461
01:06:41,163 --> 01:06:43,581
Not his, anyway.

1462
01:06:43,708 --> 01:06:45,291
- Okay.

1463
01:06:45,418 --> 01:06:47,335
I think they're starting, huh?

1464
01:06:47,461 --> 01:06:49,754
- What are you doing here?

1465
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:51,297
- We just didn't want
to interrupt,

1466
01:06:51,424 --> 01:06:52,549
you know, with our nonsense.

1467
01:06:52,675 --> 01:06:56,386
- No, why did you bother
coming here at all?

1468
01:06:56,512 --> 01:06:58,763
- You know why I came here.

1469
01:06:58,889 --> 01:07:03,560
I came for you,
for Jack, to support you.

1470
01:07:03,686 --> 01:07:05,061
- Mom's here to support me.

1471
01:07:05,187 --> 01:07:07,564
- Will, you want to walk over
with me?

1472
01:07:07,690 --> 01:07:10,191
- She was my granddaughter.

1473
01:07:10,317 --> 01:07:11,401
I'm here for Isabel.

1474
01:07:11,527 --> 01:07:12,527
- Don't you dare say her name.

1475
01:07:12,653 --> 01:07:14,904
- Emilia.
- Will, let's go.

1476
01:07:15,031 --> 01:07:16,781
Do you want to do this,
or do you want to go home?

1477
01:07:16,907 --> 01:07:18,241
- I will not allow you
to speak to me-

1478
01:07:18,367 --> 01:07:20,326
- You won't allow me?
- What are you doing?

1479
01:07:20,453 --> 01:07:22,746
- You know why my parents
got divorced, Jack?

1480
01:07:22,872 --> 01:07:25,582
I didn't tell you.
I didn't tell anyone.

1481
01:07:25,708 --> 01:07:26,791
You don't even know I know.

1482
01:07:26,917 --> 01:07:27,959
- Emilia, shut up.

1483
01:07:28,085 --> 01:07:31,921
- My father was spending
$1,000 a month

1484
01:07:32,048 --> 01:07:34,257
on a Russian stripper.

1485
01:07:34,383 --> 01:07:37,427
Sheldon Greenleaf:
judge/sex addict.

1486
01:07:42,141 --> 01:07:43,767
- Come on, Sheldon.
Let's go.

1487
01:07:43,893 --> 01:07:45,393
Come on, just walk.

1488
01:07:52,068 --> 01:07:53,276
- You don't have
to chase me away.

1489
01:07:53,402 --> 01:07:54,527
I'll just go, if you want.

1490
01:07:54,653 --> 01:07:57,155
- Okay.

1491
01:07:57,281 --> 01:08:01,367
Thanks, Simon.

1492
01:08:01,494 --> 01:08:06,956
- Um, I'm still gonna put
my hearts in the water, so...

1493
01:08:07,083 --> 01:08:10,043
- I'll call you later.

1494
01:09:08,018 --> 01:09:10,019
- For more than seven years,
he's traveIed the gIobe,

1495
01:09:10,146 --> 01:09:11,604
chasing tornadoes
on the rampage.

1496
01:09:13,149 --> 01:09:17,694
[knocking at door]

1497
01:09:17,820 --> 01:09:20,697
- Hey.

1498
01:09:20,823 --> 01:09:23,449
What you watching?

1499
01:09:23,576 --> 01:09:27,495
- Some storm chasers thing.

1500
01:09:27,621 --> 01:09:30,206
- Is it any good?

1501
01:09:36,297 --> 01:09:41,634
Will, I'm really sorry about
what happened today in the park.

1502
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:47,140
I guess I just lost it.

1503
01:09:47,266 --> 01:09:49,350
- I'm kind of watching this.

1504
01:09:53,814 --> 01:09:56,232
- Okay.

1505
01:10:00,529 --> 01:10:03,281
Sleep well.

1506
01:10:19,798 --> 01:10:22,300
I'm sorry, Jack.

1507
01:10:22,426 --> 01:10:23,718
- I can't do this anymore.

1508
01:10:23,844 --> 01:10:26,721
- The whole thing just
freaked me out with the hearts

1509
01:10:26,847 --> 01:10:29,515
and the candles and
ectopic pregnancies with names.

1510
01:10:29,642 --> 01:10:31,434
- It's not a "Get Out
of Jail Free" card, Emilia.

1511
01:10:31,560 --> 01:10:33,019
- I know.
I know.

1512
01:10:33,145 --> 01:10:35,355
- Isabel's death doesn't make it
okay for you to hurt people.

1513
01:10:35,481 --> 01:10:37,899
- I know that.

1514
01:10:38,025 --> 01:10:41,236
- No, I don't think you do.

1515
01:10:41,362 --> 01:10:42,946
I'm gonna ask you a question.

1516
01:10:43,072 --> 01:10:46,574
- Jack, please.
- I want you to answer it.

1517
01:10:46,700 --> 01:10:52,705
Do you know why you
fell in love with me?

1518
01:10:52,831 --> 01:10:58,253
- When I first saw you,

1519
01:10:58,379 --> 01:11:00,380
it was...

1520
01:11:00,506 --> 01:11:05,927
it was like I recognized you.

1521
01:11:06,053 --> 01:11:08,137
- Yeah.

1522
01:11:08,264 --> 01:11:10,556
Recognized me.

1523
01:11:10,683 --> 01:11:13,142
That's probably right.

1524
01:11:13,269 --> 01:11:15,144
Your father, Emilia.

1525
01:11:15,271 --> 01:11:16,312
That's who you recognized.

1526
01:11:16,438 --> 01:11:17,772
- You are nothing like
my father.

1527
01:11:17,898 --> 01:11:19,899
- Are you kidding me?
I'm just like him.

1528
01:11:20,025 --> 01:11:21,067
- Jack.

1529
01:11:21,193 --> 01:11:22,443
- I'm a lawyer.
I'm a cheater.

1530
01:11:22,569 --> 01:11:24,112
I left my family
just like he did.

1531
01:11:24,238 --> 01:11:26,447
- Jack, I don't want to fuck
my father, okay?

1532
01:11:26,573 --> 01:11:28,199
I fell in love with you.

1533
01:11:28,325 --> 01:11:30,702
And you fell in love
with me too.

1534
01:11:30,828 --> 01:11:32,662
We couldn't help it.
- And that makes it okay?

1535
01:11:32,788 --> 01:11:34,497
It's not the two of us
fucking things up?

1536
01:11:34,623 --> 01:11:36,207
- That's the last thing
I'd want to do.

1537
01:11:36,333 --> 01:11:38,376
That's what he did.
My father betrayed me.

1538
01:11:38,502 --> 01:11:40,837
- No, he didn't betray you.

1539
01:11:40,963 --> 01:11:42,672
He betrayed your mother.

1540
01:11:42,798 --> 01:11:45,508
- That's the same thing.
- It's not the same thing.

1541
01:11:45,634 --> 01:11:47,385
Children are not
their mothers, Emilia.

1542
01:11:47,511 --> 01:11:48,678
William is not Carolyn.

1543
01:11:48,804 --> 01:11:50,805
You don't get to hate him.

1544
01:11:50,931 --> 01:11:55,101
- I don't hate William.

1545
01:11:55,227 --> 01:11:59,022
- You should see your face
when you look at him.

1546
01:11:59,148 --> 01:12:02,233
You're cold, Emilia.

1547
01:12:02,359 --> 01:12:05,695
Cold.

1548
01:12:05,821 --> 01:12:08,364
He's a child.

1549
01:12:08,490 --> 01:12:12,327
He needs to be protected.

1550
01:12:12,453 --> 01:12:13,745
And maybe we both
fucked that up.

1551
01:12:13,871 --> 01:12:14,871
Maybe I did more than you.

1552
01:12:14,997 --> 01:12:16,414
- Yeah, by letting him
near me, right?

1553
01:12:16,540 --> 01:12:17,540
- Oh, come on.

1554
01:12:17,666 --> 01:12:19,208
- Just say
what you really mean, Jack.

1555
01:12:19,335 --> 01:12:21,669
This is about Isabel.
- This is not about Isabel!

1556
01:12:21,795 --> 01:12:24,005
Not everything in the fucking
world is about Isabel.

1557
01:12:24,131 --> 01:12:25,798
She was my daughter too.

1558
01:12:25,924 --> 01:12:28,009
Losing her broke my heart too!

1559
01:12:28,135 --> 01:12:29,302
- Losing her?

1560
01:12:29,428 --> 01:12:33,598
We didn't lose her, Jack.

1561
01:12:33,724 --> 01:12:38,227
I killed her.

1562
01:12:38,354 --> 01:12:41,105
- What are you talking about?

1563
01:12:41,231 --> 01:12:44,609
- Remember?

1564
01:12:44,735 --> 01:12:48,946
You told me to put her
in the bassinet?

1565
01:12:49,073 --> 01:12:51,324
And I said I would
when she finished.

1566
01:12:53,243 --> 01:12:57,080
[baby squeaking]

1567
01:12:57,206 --> 01:13:01,459
And then you fell asleep,
and I was so tired.

1568
01:13:01,585 --> 01:13:03,461
But she had finally
started feeding,

1569
01:13:03,587 --> 01:13:06,589
so she was fine.

1570
01:13:13,222 --> 01:13:17,350
I fell asleep again.

1571
01:13:17,476 --> 01:13:20,478
[phone buzzing]

1572
01:13:23,315 --> 01:13:26,317
Then something woke me up.

1573
01:13:33,075 --> 01:13:34,534
And she was gone.

1574
01:13:34,660 --> 01:13:36,452
Isabel.

1575
01:13:39,248 --> 01:13:41,124
Isabel!

1576
01:13:41,250 --> 01:13:44,043
Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack!

1577
01:13:44,169 --> 01:13:46,212
She's not-
she's not breathing!

1578
01:13:46,338 --> 01:13:50,216
She's not breathing!
She's not breathing!

1579
01:13:50,342 --> 01:13:52,677
- Isabel.

1580
01:13:52,803 --> 01:13:55,721
- What do we do?
- Call 91 1.

1581
01:13:55,848 --> 01:13:59,934
- What do we do?

1582
01:14:00,060 --> 01:14:01,853
I told you
and I told the police

1583
01:14:01,979 --> 01:14:08,734
that I found her
in the bassinet, but...

1584
01:14:08,861 --> 01:14:09,944
I lied.

1585
01:14:17,244 --> 01:14:20,413
She fell asleep in my arms.

1586
01:14:20,539 --> 01:14:27,795
I had her head in my hands
and her face pressed against me.

1587
01:14:27,921 --> 01:14:31,966
I-I fell asleep.

1588
01:14:32,092 --> 01:14:35,428
[sobs]

1589
01:14:35,554 --> 01:14:40,308
- No.

1590
01:14:40,434 --> 01:14:42,894
You did not smother her.

1591
01:14:43,020 --> 01:14:45,188
- I did, Jack.

1592
01:14:45,314 --> 01:14:47,690
You know I did.

1593
01:14:47,816 --> 01:14:51,319
You knew she wasn't
in the bassinet, didn't you?

1594
01:14:51,445 --> 01:14:56,657
- No, the autopsy report said
that she died of natural causes.

1595
01:14:56,783 --> 01:14:59,035
It said that she died of SIDS.

1596
01:14:59,161 --> 01:15:02,288
- No, the medical examiner
said she stopped breathing.

1597
01:15:02,414 --> 01:15:05,041
And the reason
she stopped breathing

1598
01:15:05,167 --> 01:15:07,210
was 'cause she couldn't.

1599
01:15:07,336 --> 01:15:08,753
- No, you-

1600
01:15:08,879 --> 01:15:13,382
you didn't-
she wasn't crushed.

1601
01:15:13,509 --> 01:15:15,051
The autopsy report
said specifically

1602
01:15:15,177 --> 01:15:16,302
that she wasn't crushed.

1603
01:15:16,428 --> 01:15:20,056
- I didn't crush her, Jack.

1604
01:15:20,182 --> 01:15:22,767
I smothered her.

1605
01:15:30,567 --> 01:15:33,569
- [sobbing]

1606
01:15:35,364 --> 01:15:38,366
- You're a lawyer, Jack.

1607
01:15:38,492 --> 01:15:40,368
Argue me out of it.

1608
01:15:43,789 --> 01:15:46,791
- [quietly sobbing]

1609
01:15:50,462 --> 01:15:55,883
- It's not just you.

1610
01:15:56,009 --> 01:15:58,010
I can't do this anymore either.

1611
01:16:00,097 --> 01:16:03,099
- [sobbing]

1612
01:16:23,245 --> 01:16:24,245
- I got it.

1613
01:16:25,914 --> 01:16:28,916
Are you okay?

1614
01:16:42,931 --> 01:16:45,933
[birds chirping]

1615
01:16:57,904 --> 01:17:00,114
- Taxi!

1616
01:17:11,043 --> 01:17:14,503
- You looked like you saw
a ghost back there.

1617
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:18,215
- It's just,
you're never up here.

1618
01:17:18,342 --> 01:17:19,425
That's all.

1619
01:17:19,551 --> 01:17:22,678
- Oh, I was waiting for Will.

1620
01:17:22,804 --> 01:17:26,724
We made plans to be in that
movie together in the park.

1621
01:17:26,850 --> 01:17:28,643
- How is he?

1622
01:17:28,769 --> 01:17:30,561
- He didn't show.

1623
01:17:30,687 --> 01:17:34,607
I guess his mother said no.

1624
01:17:34,733 --> 01:17:40,196
Jack told me you left home.

1625
01:17:40,322 --> 01:17:42,198
You plan on going back?

1626
01:17:42,324 --> 01:17:45,326
- I don't think I'm really
very good for that family.

1627
01:17:45,452 --> 01:17:48,621
- Look, I was not
a very good husband.

1628
01:17:48,747 --> 01:17:52,083
But I am not a bad person.

1629
01:17:52,209 --> 01:17:55,002
I didn't think that
at the time.

1630
01:17:55,128 --> 01:18:00,049
I thought,
"I'm not fit to be here."

1631
01:18:00,175 --> 01:18:04,553
So I didn't fight
when your mother told me to go.

1632
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:07,223
I didn't fight for her.

1633
01:18:07,349 --> 01:18:11,018
I didn't fight for you.

1634
01:18:11,144 --> 01:18:16,565
Don't make
the same mistake I made.

1635
01:18:16,692 --> 01:18:22,071
- My mistakes have happened,
and I've been punished.

1636
01:18:25,575 --> 01:18:28,369
- Isabel's not dead

1637
01:18:28,495 --> 01:18:30,454
because you needed
to be punished.

1638
01:18:30,580 --> 01:18:34,250
- Then why is she dead?

1639
01:18:36,378 --> 01:18:38,921
- I don't know.

1640
01:18:39,047 --> 01:18:40,548
I don't know.

1641
01:18:40,674 --> 01:18:42,258
She stopped living.

1642
01:18:42,384 --> 01:18:43,634
That's all.

1643
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:48,806
Is that what you want?

1644
01:18:48,932 --> 01:18:50,558
You want to stop living?

1645
01:18:50,684 --> 01:18:54,228
- I want her back.

1646
01:18:54,354 --> 01:18:57,606
- That's not one
of your choices, honey.

1647
01:18:57,733 --> 01:19:01,777
I'm sorry.

1648
01:19:01,903 --> 01:19:04,905
That would be my choice too.

1649
01:19:13,165 --> 01:19:15,624
- I'm sorry for what I said,

1650
01:19:15,751 --> 01:19:18,544
what I said about you.

1651
01:19:18,670 --> 01:19:21,380
I don't know why.

1652
01:19:21,506 --> 01:19:23,799
- It's okay, honey.

1653
01:19:23,925 --> 01:19:27,678
It's all okay, hmm?

1654
01:19:33,643 --> 01:19:38,647
[phone ringing]

1655
01:19:38,774 --> 01:19:41,066
- Hello?

1656
01:19:41,193 --> 01:19:42,359
Oh.

1657
01:19:42,486 --> 01:19:44,820
Yeah?

1658
01:19:44,946 --> 01:19:47,364
This afternoon?

1659
01:19:47,491 --> 01:19:49,325
Okay.

1660
01:19:49,451 --> 01:19:53,120
Yeah, I know where
the office is.

1661
01:19:53,246 --> 01:19:54,997
Okay.

1662
01:20:05,091 --> 01:20:07,760
- Miss Greenleaf?

1663
01:20:09,971 --> 01:20:11,514
- Jack told me you moved out.

1664
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:13,140
- You talked to him?

1665
01:20:13,266 --> 01:20:15,017
- Yes, I did.

1666
01:20:15,143 --> 01:20:19,480
William was very upset to see
you leave with your suitcase.

1667
01:20:19,606 --> 01:20:22,107
You never understood that
children have eyes, have you?

1668
01:20:22,234 --> 01:20:24,860
I called Jack to talk about it,

1669
01:20:24,986 --> 01:20:28,239
and he told me what happened
the night Isabel died.

1670
01:20:29,616 --> 01:20:31,033
- Oh.
- Mm-hmm.

1671
01:20:31,159 --> 01:20:32,368
He asked if it was possible

1672
01:20:32,494 --> 01:20:34,411
that you could have smothered
her with your breast-

1673
01:20:34,538 --> 01:20:36,413
my medical opinion.

1674
01:20:36,540 --> 01:20:38,332
- What did you tell him?

1675
01:20:38,458 --> 01:20:40,334
- I told him,
yes, it was possible.

1676
01:20:40,460 --> 01:20:42,753
Yes, you could have
accidentally killed Isabel.

1677
01:20:42,879 --> 01:20:44,547
You probably had.

1678
01:20:44,673 --> 01:20:47,007
Any woman who's so casual
with William's safety

1679
01:20:47,133 --> 01:20:48,884
could just as easily
have fallen asleep

1680
01:20:49,010 --> 01:20:52,179
and smothered her own child.

1681
01:20:54,015 --> 01:20:55,850
William was very mad at me.

1682
01:20:55,976 --> 01:20:58,185
He said I should be
ashamed of myself.

1683
01:20:58,311 --> 01:21:01,355
He's very loyal, William.

1684
01:21:01,481 --> 01:21:02,606
- He knows?

1685
01:21:02,732 --> 01:21:04,817
- Yes, well, he overheard
the conversation.

1686
01:21:04,943 --> 01:21:06,068
I'm sorry.

1687
01:21:06,194 --> 01:21:07,319
My apartment's quite small.

1688
01:21:07,445 --> 01:21:09,071
- Your apartment's huge.

1689
01:21:09,197 --> 01:21:10,614
You must have been shouting.

1690
01:21:12,701 --> 01:21:14,243
- He said
that you loved Isabel

1691
01:21:14,369 --> 01:21:16,203
and that you
couldn't have killed her.

1692
01:21:16,329 --> 01:21:18,455
And I told him I hadn't said
that you'd killed the baby.

1693
01:21:18,582 --> 01:21:21,917
I told him that you might have
accidentally smothered her.

1694
01:21:22,043 --> 01:21:23,502
- Carolyn, why am I here?

1695
01:21:23,628 --> 01:21:24,920
I'd really like to leave.

1696
01:21:27,090 --> 01:21:29,758
- William asked me to help you.

1697
01:21:29,885 --> 01:21:31,719
He said because I'm a doctor,

1698
01:21:31,845 --> 01:21:34,638
I could find out what
really happened to Isabel.

1699
01:21:34,764 --> 01:21:36,765
- I didn't realize he cared,

1700
01:21:36,892 --> 01:21:38,434
since she wasn't a person,
you know,

1701
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:39,894
according to the Jewish law.

1702
01:21:43,064 --> 01:21:46,734
- Your pediatrician got a copy
of the autopsy report.

1703
01:21:46,860 --> 01:21:48,277
- I know.

1704
01:21:49,571 --> 01:21:51,947
- Well, I had his office
fax it to me yesterday,

1705
01:21:52,073 --> 01:21:53,198
and I reviewed it

1706
01:21:53,325 --> 01:21:54,950
with a classmate of mine
from Stanford.

1707
01:21:55,076 --> 01:21:58,495
She's a pathologist who
specializes in neonatal cases.

1708
01:21:58,622 --> 01:22:01,665
She testifies
in criminal trials.

1709
01:22:01,791 --> 01:22:05,794
And she confirms
the coroner's conclusion.

1710
01:22:05,921 --> 01:22:09,798
- I know the official verdict:
SIDS.

1711
01:22:09,925 --> 01:22:11,884
- I asked for
more specific conclusions,

1712
01:22:12,010 --> 01:22:14,345
and she said
there's absolutely no evidence

1713
01:22:14,471 --> 01:22:17,514
to suggest
that Isabel was smothered.

1714
01:22:17,641 --> 01:22:19,808
Smothering always
leaves traces:

1715
01:22:19,935 --> 01:22:23,437
a torn upper lip frenulum,
signs of positional asphyxia,

1716
01:22:23,563 --> 01:22:24,813
dots of blood in the lungs,

1717
01:22:24,940 --> 01:22:26,607
and in Isabel's case,

1718
01:22:26,733 --> 01:22:29,985
there was no evidence
that she'd been smothered.

1719
01:22:30,111 --> 01:22:32,571
So you can't have smothered her.

1720
01:22:32,697 --> 01:22:34,573
You didn't kill your baby.

1721
01:22:34,699 --> 01:22:36,992
She died of SIDS.

1722
01:22:37,118 --> 01:22:43,791
You just had the misfortune
of holding her when she died.

1723
01:22:45,835 --> 01:22:47,836
- Your friend's a pathologist?

1724
01:22:47,963 --> 01:22:50,339
- A perinatal specialist.

1725
01:22:50,465 --> 01:22:52,716
Yeah, she's 100% secure
in her conclusions

1726
01:22:52,842 --> 01:22:55,803
that Isabel died from SIDS.

1727
01:22:55,929 --> 01:22:59,890
Based on the facts,
it's scientifically impossible

1728
01:23:00,016 --> 01:23:02,726
that she died from smothering.

1729
01:23:05,146 --> 01:23:08,482
Are you listening?

1730
01:23:08,608 --> 01:23:11,026
She also said
she'd speak with you

1731
01:23:11,152 --> 01:23:13,612
if you'd rather hear it
from her directly

1732
01:23:13,738 --> 01:23:18,701
or if you have
any other questions.

1733
01:23:18,827 --> 01:23:20,869
I need to know that you
understand what I'm saying,

1734
01:23:20,996 --> 01:23:22,413
so I'm going to repeat this

1735
01:23:22,539 --> 01:23:26,417
until you say
that you understand.

1736
01:23:26,543 --> 01:23:28,419
You didn't kill your child,
Emilia.

1737
01:23:28,545 --> 01:23:30,713
You didn't kill your baby.

1738
01:23:30,839 --> 01:23:35,509
Your baby died
because babies do sometimes.

1739
01:23:35,635 --> 01:23:38,137
They just slip away
for no reason.

1740
01:23:38,263 --> 01:23:41,515
It's no one's fault.
It's not your fault.

1741
01:23:41,641 --> 01:23:43,642
You didn't do anything wrong.

1742
01:23:43,768 --> 01:23:46,770
- [sobbing quietly]

1743
01:23:54,112 --> 01:23:55,446
- Do you understand?

1744
01:23:55,572 --> 01:23:59,908
- [sobbing]

1745
01:24:00,035 --> 01:24:02,703
I understand.

1746
01:24:05,874 --> 01:24:07,916
- Good.

1747
01:24:10,712 --> 01:24:12,588
I'm gonna leave you alone
for a while.

1748
01:24:57,425 --> 01:25:01,637
- Hi.
- Hi.

1749
01:25:01,763 --> 01:25:04,807
- I've-I just came
from Carolyn's office.

1750
01:25:04,933 --> 01:25:06,683
And she told me
I couldn't have killed Isabel.

1751
01:25:06,810 --> 01:25:08,811
She had her pathologist
look at the medical report.

1752
01:25:08,937 --> 01:25:10,437
- Sit down.

1753
01:25:16,194 --> 01:25:17,528
- I really think
you should call her

1754
01:25:17,654 --> 01:25:20,572
and hear what she has to say,
because I didn't do it.

1755
01:25:20,698 --> 01:25:23,367
- I never thought you did.

1756
01:25:23,493 --> 01:25:24,535
- But your face,

1757
01:25:24,661 --> 01:25:26,120
your face when I told you

1758
01:25:26,246 --> 01:25:27,913
and your face
the night that she died-

1759
01:25:28,039 --> 01:25:31,583
- How should I look, Emilia,
when my daughter dies,

1760
01:25:31,709 --> 01:25:34,336
when my wife says
she killed her?

1761
01:25:34,462 --> 01:25:39,007
People have their own feelings.

1762
01:25:39,134 --> 01:25:41,510
- I talked to my father,
and I apologized to him.

1763
01:25:41,636 --> 01:25:44,096
And you were right.
You were right.

1764
01:25:44,222 --> 01:25:46,223
I've been working through things
in our relationship

1765
01:25:46,349 --> 01:25:48,517
that are really about him
and my family and things-

1766
01:25:48,643 --> 01:25:50,435
- Emilia, don't.

1767
01:25:50,562 --> 01:25:53,355
None of this matters.

1768
01:25:53,481 --> 01:25:56,483
- We are not a mistake.

1769
01:25:56,609 --> 01:25:58,360
You're my family,
and I want to be with you.

1770
01:25:58,486 --> 01:26:00,529
- William's my family.

1771
01:26:00,655 --> 01:26:02,656
- And me,
William and me.

1772
01:26:02,782 --> 01:26:03,991
I love William.

1773
01:26:04,117 --> 01:26:05,284
- Em, please.

1774
01:26:05,410 --> 01:26:06,410
- He loves me.

1775
01:26:06,536 --> 01:26:07,995
He made his mother find out.

1776
01:26:08,121 --> 01:26:09,163
He loves me.

1777
01:26:09,289 --> 01:26:12,040
- I know.

1778
01:26:12,167 --> 01:26:14,209
It's the people who love you
you're the hardest on.

1779
01:26:17,505 --> 01:26:19,131
I'm sorry.

1780
01:26:19,257 --> 01:26:22,467
I just can't.

1781
01:26:22,594 --> 01:26:24,678
That's how it is.

1782
01:26:37,525 --> 01:26:38,692
- Okay.

1783
01:26:52,749 --> 01:26:54,374
No, no, no, Marilyn.

1784
01:26:54,500 --> 01:26:55,751
I don't need to talk to him.

1785
01:26:55,877 --> 01:26:57,002
You can just let him know

1786
01:26:57,128 --> 01:26:59,087
that I'll stop by
the apartment

1787
01:26:59,214 --> 01:27:00,756
tomorrow around noon, okay?

1788
01:27:00,882 --> 01:27:03,133
And I'll leave the keys
with the super.

1789
01:27:03,259 --> 01:27:04,843
And to answer his email,

1790
01:27:04,969 --> 01:27:07,012
no, I don't want
any of the baby stuff.

1791
01:27:07,138 --> 01:27:09,264
He can sell it.

1792
01:27:09,390 --> 01:27:12,434
eBay, whatever.
I don't know.

1793
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:15,103
Yeah, seriously.

1794
01:27:15,230 --> 01:27:16,647
Thank you.

- Hey, Will.

1824
01:29:13,848 --> 01:29:16,391
What's up?

1825
01:29:16,517 --> 01:29:21,063
- Well, his mother's
getting married today.

1826
01:29:21,189 --> 01:29:22,898
And he wouldn't leave
the house without me,

1827
01:29:23,024 --> 01:29:26,068
and now he won't go inside
without you.

1828
01:29:26,194 --> 01:29:27,402
- Let me guess.

1829
01:29:27,528 --> 01:29:28,862
When I moved out
three weeks ago,

1830
01:29:28,988 --> 01:29:32,741
did you think your dad was gonna
move back in with your mom?

1831
01:29:32,867 --> 01:29:34,242
- Sort of.

1832
01:29:34,369 --> 01:29:37,120
Since you were done
being married,

1833
01:29:37,246 --> 01:29:39,915
they could be done
being divorced.

1834
01:29:40,041 --> 01:29:42,876
- But it's not working out
that way, is it?

1835
01:29:43,002 --> 01:29:44,461
She's marrying somebody else.

1836
01:29:44,587 --> 01:29:46,254
- Yeah.

1837
01:29:46,381 --> 01:29:47,756
- That's hard.

1838
01:29:47,882 --> 01:29:51,968
Not everything works out
the way you hope.

1839
01:29:52,095 --> 01:29:56,264
What can you do?

1840
01:29:56,391 --> 01:30:00,185
Will, help me out here, bud.

1841
01:30:00,311 --> 01:30:01,937
Why'd you ask to see me?

1842
01:30:02,063 --> 01:30:03,230
I would have thought I'd be

1843
01:30:03,356 --> 01:30:04,981
the last person
you'd want to see.

1844
01:30:05,108 --> 01:30:07,776
- Well, Sonia's in New Jersey.

1845
01:30:07,902 --> 01:30:09,486
But she's not family.

1846
01:30:09,612 --> 01:30:15,575
And I figured,
you're my sister's mom.

1847
01:30:15,701 --> 01:30:18,203
And that's family.

1848
01:30:18,329 --> 01:30:20,705
Right?

1849
01:30:20,832 --> 01:30:25,168
- I will always be
your sister's mom.

1850
01:30:25,294 --> 01:30:27,838
- Then how come
you don't live with us anymore?

1851
01:30:33,594 --> 01:30:39,015
- Well, because...

1852
01:30:39,142 --> 01:30:42,060
I don't belong with you guys.

1853
01:30:42,186 --> 01:30:44,729
It's like Lyle the Crocodile.

1854
01:30:44,856 --> 01:30:46,481
Lyle doesn't belong
in an apartment.

1855
01:30:46,607 --> 01:30:48,358
He belongs with
all the other crocodiles

1856
01:30:48,484 --> 01:30:50,485
at the Central Park Zoo.

1857
01:30:50,611 --> 01:30:54,614
- There are no crocodiles there,
only caimans.

1858
01:30:54,740 --> 01:30:58,493
- It's a metaphor, William.

1859
01:30:58,619 --> 01:31:01,872
You know metaphors.

1860
01:31:01,998 --> 01:31:06,084
What I'm trying to say is,
I'm sort of like Lyle.

1861
01:31:06,210 --> 01:31:10,046
You know, I don't belong
with you and your dad,

1862
01:31:10,173 --> 01:31:12,841
'cause, you know,
my teeth are too sharp

1863
01:31:12,967 --> 01:31:17,345
and my tail is too long.

1864
01:31:17,472 --> 01:31:20,223
- But Lyle does so belong
with his family.

1865
01:31:20,349 --> 01:31:25,437
They love him,
even though he's a crocodile,

1866
01:31:25,563 --> 01:31:29,149
even when he's not always
the nicest

1867
01:31:29,275 --> 01:31:31,151
or not so good with children.

1868
01:31:31,277 --> 01:31:34,154
- Lyle was always nice
to children.

1869
01:31:34,280 --> 01:31:35,989
- It's a metaphor, Emilia.

1870
01:31:37,617 --> 01:31:38,700
- Thanks, Will.

1871
01:31:38,826 --> 01:31:41,203
It's a really good one.

1872
01:31:41,329 --> 01:31:43,538
- [laughing]

1873
01:31:43,664 --> 01:31:45,999
So what do you say, Will?

1874
01:31:46,125 --> 01:31:48,418
You ready to do this?

1875
01:31:48,544 --> 01:31:52,130
- Let's not ruin her day, okay?

1876
01:31:57,094 --> 01:31:59,012
Not bad.

1877
01:31:59,138 --> 01:32:01,598
I mean, you look miserable,
but not bad.

1878
01:32:01,724 --> 01:32:05,393
That's what I shoot for.

1879
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:06,561
- Come on.

1880
01:32:06,687 --> 01:32:08,104
- She'll hold our time,
won't she?

1881
01:32:08,231 --> 01:32:10,065
- I'm sure.

1882
01:32:10,191 --> 01:32:11,399
- Oh, thank God.

1883
01:32:11,526 --> 01:32:13,401
What happened?
Why is Emilia here?

1884
01:32:13,528 --> 01:32:15,028
Never mind.
Let's go.

1885
01:32:15,154 --> 01:32:16,613
We're late.

1886
01:32:16,739 --> 01:32:18,907
We were due in Judge Jody's
chambers ten minutes ago.

1887
01:32:20,868 --> 01:32:23,745
We have to run.

1888
01:32:32,755 --> 01:32:34,714
- Thank you.

1889
01:32:34,840 --> 01:32:36,591
- Anytime.

1890
01:32:39,011 --> 01:32:40,095
- What are you doing now?

1891
01:32:40,221 --> 01:32:43,807
- Getting fired, probably.

1892
01:32:43,933 --> 01:32:46,393
I've been working
at Simon's legal aid thing.

1893
01:32:46,519 --> 01:32:50,021
It's day six,
and I've been AWOL twice.

1894
01:32:50,147 --> 01:32:53,900
- I meant-

1895
01:32:54,026 --> 01:32:56,653
I thought maybe
we could have dinner

1896
01:32:56,779 --> 01:32:58,238
or take a walk or something.

1897
01:33:01,075 --> 01:33:03,159
- Are we allowed?

1898
01:33:03,286 --> 01:33:04,953
- Yeah.

1899
01:33:05,079 --> 01:33:08,790
We are.

1900
01:33:22,221 --> 01:33:23,471
- So I said, "Really?

1901
01:33:23,598 --> 01:33:27,851
Because the Big Bang
is older than the Bible and..."

1902
01:33:27,977 --> 01:33:30,020
Come on.
I'm telling a story.

1903
01:33:30,146 --> 01:33:32,606
- What are you carrying?
Nothing.

1904
01:33:32,732 --> 01:33:34,232
Plus, I'm 100.

1905
01:33:34,358 --> 01:33:36,651
Wait.

1906
01:33:36,777 --> 01:33:38,570
- Anyway, I said
that the Big Bang

1907
01:33:38,696 --> 01:33:40,280
was older than the Bible.

1908
01:33:40,406 --> 01:33:42,157
Then Michelle, Burton,
and Kimberly

1909
01:33:42,283 --> 01:33:44,618
said that I was gonna
go to hell.

1910
01:33:44,744 --> 01:33:46,536
Is there a hell?

1911
01:33:46,662 --> 01:33:47,704
- There are several.

1912
01:33:47,830 --> 01:33:49,664
Your classroom is one of them.

1913
01:33:49,790 --> 01:33:51,166
Let's sit down for a minute.

1914
01:33:51,292 --> 01:33:52,334
My feet are killing me.

1915
01:33:52,460 --> 01:33:54,628
These shoes.

1916
01:33:56,339 --> 01:33:57,422
- My mom says you always have

1917
01:33:57,548 --> 01:33:59,841
very comfortable-looking
shoes on.

1918
01:33:59,967 --> 01:34:03,303
She says everyone
in New Rochelle does.

1919
01:34:03,429 --> 01:34:06,014
- Here, this is for you.

1920
01:34:06,140 --> 01:34:08,141
Open it.

1921
01:34:10,978 --> 01:34:14,522
- It's the one
from Isabel's room.

1922
01:34:14,649 --> 01:34:17,359
- Nono gave it to me
when I was ten.

1923
01:34:17,485 --> 01:34:19,819
And now I'm giving it to you.

1924
01:34:19,945 --> 01:34:22,614
- It's better than a new one.

1925
01:34:22,740 --> 01:34:24,199
- Let's go see
if it still works.

1926
01:34:24,325 --> 01:34:26,201
- Most people don't know it,

1927
01:34:26,327 --> 01:34:27,911
but the real name
for the boat pond

1928
01:34:28,037 --> 01:34:29,454
is the Conservatory Water.

1929
01:34:29,580 --> 01:34:32,040
- Hmm, interesting.

1930
01:34:32,166 --> 01:34:34,918
It's a birthday present.

1931
01:34:35,044 --> 01:34:38,463
- But my birthday's
not until next month.

1932
01:34:38,589 --> 01:34:41,341
It's 32 days away.

1933
01:34:41,467 --> 01:34:42,884
- It's a birthday present
for you,

1934
01:34:43,010 --> 01:34:44,761
but it's not for your birthday.

1935
01:34:44,887 --> 01:34:46,805
It's for somebody else's
birthday.

1936
01:34:46,931 --> 01:34:50,392
Think.

1937
01:34:50,518 --> 01:34:51,476
- Blair?

1938
01:34:51,602 --> 01:34:52,644
- Yeah.

1939
01:34:52,770 --> 01:34:54,646
- He was born
while I was at school?

1940
01:34:54,772 --> 01:34:56,856
- Seven pounds, three ounces.

1941
01:34:56,982 --> 01:35:01,069
Your dad and I will take you
to see him tonight.

1942
01:35:01,195 --> 01:35:03,571
- Blair Soule-Tolliver I.

1943
01:35:03,698 --> 01:35:06,908
And I'm William Soule-Woolf I.

1944
01:35:07,034 --> 01:35:08,076
We're both first,

1945
01:35:08,202 --> 01:35:09,577
and we have
the same middle name.

1946
01:35:09,704 --> 01:35:14,833
- I know.
You've told me about 600 times.

1947
01:35:14,959 --> 01:35:19,045
- I'll have to make a new family
portrait with Blair in it.

1948
01:35:19,171 --> 01:35:21,756
You never saw the one I did.

1949
01:35:21,882 --> 01:35:23,341
- No, I did.

1950
01:35:23,467 --> 01:35:26,094
It was beautiful.

1951
01:35:26,220 --> 01:35:28,972
- I made Isabel an angel.

1952
01:35:29,098 --> 01:35:31,933
Even though I don't
really believe in angels,

1953
01:35:32,059 --> 01:35:34,811
I thought it would make you
feel better.

1954
01:35:34,937 --> 01:35:37,439
- It did.

1955
01:35:37,565 --> 01:35:39,899
Thank you.

1956
01:35:40,025 --> 01:35:43,403
- What do you think happened
to Isabel when she died?

1957
01:35:46,574 --> 01:35:48,700
- I don't know.

1958
01:35:48,826 --> 01:35:55,165
I guess I think
she just stopped being.

1959
01:35:55,291 --> 01:35:57,751
I think that whatever made her
different from everybody else

1960
01:35:57,877 --> 01:36:01,004
just disappeared when she did.

1961
01:36:01,130 --> 01:36:03,965
- No.

1962
01:36:04,091 --> 01:36:06,217
We're doing religions in school,

1963
01:36:06,343 --> 01:36:08,344
and Buddhists believe
in reincarnation.

1964
01:36:08,471 --> 01:36:15,310
That means when someone dies,
they come back as someone else.

1965
01:36:15,436 --> 01:36:18,730
And you might see
that dead person someday...

1966
01:36:18,856 --> 01:36:20,315
...and think to yourself,

1967
01:36:20,441 --> 01:36:24,319
"Hey, I really like
that person."

1968
01:36:24,445 --> 01:36:27,989
But you don't know why.

1969
01:36:29,784 --> 01:36:31,409
- I don't really
believe in that.

1970
01:36:31,535 --> 01:36:34,454
- I do.

1971
01:36:34,580 --> 01:36:36,831
I'm gonna be a Buddhist.

1972
01:36:36,957 --> 01:36:40,502
And I'm probably gonna be alive
for a long time.

1973
01:36:40,628 --> 01:36:43,421
So I'll probably run into her.

1974
01:36:43,547 --> 01:36:47,258
So I'll always keep
my eyes open.

1975
01:36:47,384 --> 01:36:51,596
When I find her,
do you want me to tell you?

1976
01:36:51,722 --> 01:36:53,181
- I'd really like that.

1977
01:36:53,307 --> 01:36:54,557
You do that.

1978
01:36:57,561 --> 01:37:00,021
- I love my boat, Emilia.

1979
01:37:00,147 --> 01:37:01,689
Thanks for the birthday present.

1980
01:37:01,816 --> 01:37:05,360
- Happy Blair's birthday,
William.

1981
01:37:05,486 --> 01:37:06,820
I love you.

1982
01:37:09,281 --> 01:37:11,115
- I know.

1983
01:37:11,242 --> 01:37:13,993
Me too.
