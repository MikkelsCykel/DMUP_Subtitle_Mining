1
00:01:04,548 --> 00:01:08,844
I heard you interfering little bastards
rummage around my yard.

2
00:01:08,927 --> 00:01:12,681
I'll thank you for keeping
the owls off of my cats.

3
00:01:41,919 --> 00:01:44,089
You sleep OK?

4
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:48,384
Sorta.

5
00:01:54,307 --> 00:01:56,434
I, uh...

6
00:01:56,517 --> 00:01:59,395
God, Jean,
I don't know what happened.

7
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:02,482
It's like a red mist or...

8
00:02:03,649 --> 00:02:07,070
Something comes over me and I...

9
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:12,742
But I feel like you backed me up
in a corner and I...

10
00:02:13,743 --> 00:02:15,829
You do that, and uh...

11
00:02:16,787 --> 00:02:18,581
I hate it when I'm like that.

12
00:02:32,303 --> 00:02:33,930
I'm sorry.

13
00:02:38,226 --> 00:02:40,519
Can you forgive me?

14
00:02:49,488 --> 00:02:51,406
What?!

15
00:02:56,245 --> 00:02:57,955
Fuck!

16
00:03:04,211 --> 00:03:06,505
You promised...

17
00:03:06,588 --> 00:03:09,341
if it happened again...

18
00:03:09,383 --> 00:03:11,301
You promised.

19
00:03:12,218 --> 00:03:16,223
OK, this is last week
and up to yesterday.

20
00:03:16,265 --> 00:03:17,641
- All right?
- OK.

21
00:03:17,724 --> 00:03:20,811
- I stuck an extra 50 bucks in there.
- Kitty, I can't...

22
00:03:20,894 --> 00:03:23,146
- You can. Listen...
- Here, just take it.

23
00:03:23,188 --> 00:03:26,525
I don't wanna see you coming around here
anymore looking like this.

24
00:03:28,276 --> 00:03:31,697
You take care.
Take care of that girl. Get going. OK.

25
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:34,408
We have a reciprocity
agreement with Kansas.

26
00:03:34,492 --> 00:03:36,535
If you can stay in this shelter for a week.

27
00:03:36,619 --> 00:03:39,162
- I could find you a place in Wichita.
- No.

28
00:03:39,246 --> 00:03:42,999
Every man in town who beats a woman
knows where this shelter is.

29
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:44,835
Do you have someone you can stay with?

30
00:03:44,918 --> 00:03:47,921
I don't think you really understand
just how worried I am.

31
00:03:47,963 --> 00:03:49,882
I don't know.
Maybe they went shopping.

32
00:03:49,965 --> 00:03:53,719
I wish someone in this goddamn place
would just...

33
00:03:53,802 --> 00:03:56,514
would just give me the truth.

34
00:03:58,766 --> 00:04:01,519
Then we could find Jean
pretty damn quick.

35
00:04:06,482 --> 00:04:09,193
Tribune, Kansas.
Do you wanna go there?

36
00:04:09,235 --> 00:04:12,780
Sure. Maybe. I mean,
we can go anywhere we want.

37
00:04:12,863 --> 00:04:15,742
How about Loving, New Mexico?

38
00:04:17,785 --> 00:04:20,246
- I like that.
- Me too.

39
00:04:21,747 --> 00:04:23,999
Topeka.

40
00:04:24,542 --> 00:04:25,961
Santa Cruz.

41
00:04:26,044 --> 00:04:29,338
Oh, my gosh.
There's a Butt, Montana.

42
00:04:29,421 --> 00:04:32,300
It's pronounced "Bute."

43
00:04:32,341 --> 00:04:34,677
- Mom?
- Oh, no. No!

44
00:04:49,901 --> 00:04:51,945
Hey!

45
00:04:53,195 --> 00:04:57,825
She's not going anywhere.
There's a rod sticking through the block.

46
00:04:57,867 --> 00:05:00,077
I'm heading to Sioux Falls.

47
00:05:01,412 --> 00:05:02,747
Yeah.

48
00:05:04,415 --> 00:05:06,709
Just take what you need.

49
00:05:16,345 --> 00:05:19,055
So one inch is 83 miles.

50
00:05:22,852 --> 00:05:26,062
Six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

51
00:05:27,814 --> 00:05:29,983
Aloha, Oregon.

52
00:05:32,528 --> 00:05:34,530
It's only ten inches away.

53
00:05:35,322 --> 00:05:40,410
So that's 830 miles
and we've already gone 300 miles...

54
00:05:40,452 --> 00:05:43,205
We're going to Wyoming.

55
00:06:15,404 --> 00:06:17,656
What's in Wyoming?

56
00:06:19,116 --> 00:06:21,995
It's where your grandfather lives.

57
00:06:23,955 --> 00:06:25,999
I have a grandfather?

58
00:06:27,584 --> 00:06:29,627
Not much of one.

59
00:06:32,588 --> 00:06:34,758
When were you going to tell me?

60
00:06:40,263 --> 00:06:42,307
Oh, I'm fine.

61
00:06:45,142 --> 00:06:47,186
Smells like rain.

62
00:06:47,228 --> 00:06:49,481
It's not gonna rain today.

63
00:06:52,108 --> 00:06:55,570
You haven't been right
about the weather since 1972.

64
00:06:55,653 --> 00:06:57,863
I know what rain looks like.

65
00:07:01,075 --> 00:07:04,079
You got something
on your mind this morning?

66
00:07:04,162 --> 00:07:06,873
The goddamn bear's back.

67
00:07:10,209 --> 00:07:13,463
Well, what do you think
you're gonna do about it?

68
00:07:13,546 --> 00:07:15,673
What I should have done a year ago.

69
00:07:48,124 --> 00:07:52,503
Did anyone notice if he had cubs?
Did you see cubs with him?

70
00:08:26,536 --> 00:08:28,079
OK.

71
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:49,560
- It's under control, Einar.
- You get out of the way and it will be.

72
00:08:49,644 --> 00:08:53,147
Come on, let's let
the Fish and Game take care of this.

73
00:08:54,983 --> 00:08:57,026
This isn't some pet dog they're after.

74
00:08:57,068 --> 00:09:00,988
I think they can tell
the difference, all right?

75
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,867
That says what
a college education gets you.

76
00:09:03,908 --> 00:09:05,785
Here we go.

77
00:09:21,467 --> 00:09:23,052
Mom.

78
00:09:23,135 --> 00:09:25,054
Welcome to Wyoming.

79
00:09:26,514 --> 00:09:28,849
Mom, this is us.

80
00:09:32,603 --> 00:09:34,981
So is my grandpa nice?

81
00:09:38,443 --> 00:09:40,987
Why didn't you tell me about him?

82
00:09:53,084 --> 00:09:54,668
Einar!

83
00:10:15,189 --> 00:10:17,191
I don't want you here.

84
00:10:18,901 --> 00:10:21,570
At least we agree on something.

85
00:10:21,653 --> 00:10:23,989
I don't wanna be here either.

86
00:10:25,574 --> 00:10:28,702
We need a place to stay
for about a month or so.

87
00:10:29,577 --> 00:10:33,624
Looks like you need every part
of your head examined.

88
00:10:34,249 --> 00:10:36,168
Is this yours?

89
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,005
She's yours too.

90
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:48,054
You telling me I have a grandchild
I don't know about?

91
00:10:49,097 --> 00:10:53,560
I'm telling you
I was pregnant at Griffin's funeral.

92
00:10:53,643 --> 00:10:55,562
Where you been till now?

93
00:10:56,938 --> 00:10:59,108
We've been on the road for two days.

94
00:10:59,984 --> 00:11:02,028
We lived in Iowa.

95
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:05,365
Now this suddenly seems like home?

96
00:11:05,907 --> 00:11:07,783
What's her name?

97
00:11:07,825 --> 00:11:09,869
My name's Griff.

98
00:11:10,953 --> 00:11:13,039
Griff Gilkyson.

99
00:11:14,082 --> 00:11:16,251
That's an unusual name for a girl.

100
00:11:18,211 --> 00:11:20,254
Einar, please.

101
00:11:21,088 --> 00:11:23,966
Just till I can earn enough
to get us out of here.

102
00:11:48,199 --> 00:11:50,701
There's a room in the basement.

103
00:12:13,392 --> 00:12:15,310
I'm sorry.

104
00:12:29,408 --> 00:12:33,245
Hey. I'm gonna go into town
and look for a job.

105
00:12:33,329 --> 00:12:36,039
You think you'll be all right here?

106
00:12:36,122 --> 00:12:38,959
All right, well, just... be good.

107
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:42,128
Love you.

108
00:13:08,322 --> 00:13:10,365
I used the bathroom.

109
00:13:10,449 --> 00:13:12,367
I heard you.

110
00:13:14,994 --> 00:13:17,873
- Are you hungry?
- Not yet.

111
00:13:22,003 --> 00:13:24,255
Is there a McDonald's in town?

112
00:13:24,338 --> 00:13:27,508
- You got five dollars?
- No, I don't.

113
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:33,514
Well, then I don't think going into town
for a meal would be a very good idea.

114
00:13:42,481 --> 00:13:44,400
How was your night?

115
00:13:45,234 --> 00:13:47,361
All right, I guess.

116
00:13:47,445 --> 00:13:49,530
Left or right?

117
00:13:51,865 --> 00:13:53,784
Let's do the right.

118
00:13:53,867 --> 00:13:55,912
Left could use a rest.

119
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:05,296
Pain bad all the time now?

120
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:07,381
Gets my full attention.

121
00:14:07,465 --> 00:14:08,841
Yep.

122
00:14:17,099 --> 00:14:19,018
What happened with my bear?

123
00:14:19,101 --> 00:14:21,103
It's his own damn bear.

124
00:14:21,186 --> 00:14:23,356
You telling me he's still alive?

125
00:14:23,439 --> 00:14:26,609
He's fine.
He's in that zoo Angie built.

126
00:14:47,548 --> 00:14:49,800
Dreaming about the sea last night.

127
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:53,178
Did you get wet?

128
00:14:53,887 --> 00:14:56,097
I walked right in.

129
00:14:58,309 --> 00:15:00,519
Felt like falling in love.

130
00:15:03,646 --> 00:15:05,941
Smelled like a woman.

131
00:15:06,858 --> 00:15:08,985
Tasted like one too.

132
00:15:09,068 --> 00:15:11,321
Your memory's not that good.

133
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:14,491
Hey.

134
00:15:15,826 --> 00:15:17,702
Down there.

135
00:15:19,412 --> 00:15:21,539
See Jean kept her looks.

136
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:26,044
Said she brought her daughter with her.

137
00:15:26,128 --> 00:15:28,255
She says it's Griffin's.

138
00:15:29,339 --> 00:15:31,257
Granddaughter.

139
00:15:32,592 --> 00:15:35,512
That's a nice thing for a man to have.

140
00:15:37,889 --> 00:15:40,517
I might go into town for breakfast.

141
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:43,229
All right.

142
00:15:46,524 --> 00:15:49,151
Taking the girl with you?

143
00:15:49,235 --> 00:15:51,445
Anything else you need?

144
00:15:53,656 --> 00:15:55,450
Yeah, look in on the bear.

145
00:15:57,869 --> 00:16:00,747
- What?
- Check on the bear.

146
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:04,792
Check on the...?
Why the hell would I do that?

147
00:16:04,876 --> 00:16:06,669
'Cause I asked you to.

148
00:16:59,472 --> 00:17:01,517
Are those my dad's things?

149
00:17:02,642 --> 00:17:04,436
Yeah, they are.

150
00:17:04,519 --> 00:17:06,563
Where does he live now?

151
00:17:08,565 --> 00:17:12,152
He's dead.
Didn't your mother tell you that?

152
00:17:12,986 --> 00:17:15,447
Yeah. But she said you were dead too.

153
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:23,038
Are you confused about why they call
a room with a table in it a dining room?

154
00:17:23,121 --> 00:17:24,998
No, sir.

155
00:17:30,587 --> 00:17:34,382
Since it looks like you didn't have
any trouble making that sandwich,

156
00:17:34,424 --> 00:17:37,927
I'd like you to make another one at 11:30.
Will you do that?

157
00:17:38,011 --> 00:17:41,514
- Yes, sir.
- And take it to that man in the little house.

158
00:17:41,556 --> 00:17:43,767
And a glass of milk.

159
00:17:43,809 --> 00:17:45,727
Yes, sir.

160
00:17:47,771 --> 00:17:51,275
Bear? Goddamnit.

161
00:17:51,358 --> 00:17:53,610
"Go check on the bear."

162
00:18:08,376 --> 00:18:10,294
Goddamnit.

163
00:18:32,358 --> 00:18:34,985
Nice wheels, Einar!

164
00:18:35,027 --> 00:18:37,322
Where did you get the rig?

165
00:18:37,405 --> 00:18:42,117
Nancy Sidwell had this shipped up from
that retirement village where Ernie died.

166
00:18:42,201 --> 00:18:44,746
Maybe it was the bike killed Ernie.

167
00:18:44,829 --> 00:18:48,791
What killed Ernie was
a lifetime of Nancy's cooking.

168
00:18:48,874 --> 00:18:52,670
- Your pickup broke down again?
- Oh, hell, no. Pickup's fine.

169
00:18:52,753 --> 00:18:55,757
I'm just out here training
for a goddamn marathon.

170
00:18:55,798 --> 00:19:01,971
I like the flag. Without an orange flag
like that, you might look ridiculous.

171
00:19:28,039 --> 00:19:30,751
- Hello, Ken, Catherine.
- Einar.

172
00:19:34,338 --> 00:19:36,423
What have I got? Bills.

173
00:19:38,008 --> 00:19:41,428
- Morning, Einar.
- Morning yourself, Nina.

174
00:19:41,512 --> 00:19:44,139
Do you believe they're still
sending junk mail to my boy?

175
00:19:44,222 --> 00:19:47,809
Well, maybe the dead are flattered
to get a letter. Ever think about that?

176
00:19:47,893 --> 00:19:50,145
I'll let you know when I'm gone.

177
00:19:50,228 --> 00:19:53,523
Maybe I'll send you a postcard
from the other side.

178
00:19:53,606 --> 00:19:56,110
Hey, how's Mitch doing?

179
00:19:56,151 --> 00:19:58,070
Mitch - he's dreaming about the sea.

180
00:19:58,153 --> 00:20:00,989
Oh, yeah?
I used to live by the ocean.

181
00:20:01,072 --> 00:20:03,282
Up in Oregon for about a year.

182
00:20:03,324 --> 00:20:07,412
Yeah, too much rain if you ask me.
But I sure like the sound it makes.

183
00:20:07,496 --> 00:20:09,831
- Grandma.
- What's up?

184
00:20:09,914 --> 00:20:13,585
If you get depressed, pull up a chair
to your kitchen sink and turn on the tap.

185
00:20:13,668 --> 00:20:16,880
If I ever get depressed,
remind me not to come to you for advice.

186
00:20:16,963 --> 00:20:19,466
Hey!

187
00:20:20,968 --> 00:20:24,889
I wonder if it's hard being that drunk
this early in the morning.

188
00:20:24,972 --> 00:20:27,517
Oh, it's easy if you
don't stop drinking all night.

189
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:31,771
- You'd know. How do you want your eggs?
- Scrambled.

190
00:20:32,771 --> 00:20:36,734
Hey, there, boys.
What can I get you this morning?

191
00:20:37,735 --> 00:20:42,156
Get down on this table and I can see if
I can stay on you till the buzzer sounds.

192
00:20:42,198 --> 00:20:44,659
Agh! I hope you're
having a lot of fun, Chris,

193
00:20:44,742 --> 00:20:49,038
'cause soon as I get one arm free,
I'm gonna kick your sorry ass.

194
00:20:49,121 --> 00:20:51,416
Oh, now look
what you went and did!

195
00:20:52,625 --> 00:20:54,293
Good morning, fellas.

196
00:20:54,376 --> 00:20:56,628
I'm gonna be your new waiter.
Want some coffee?

197
00:20:56,712 --> 00:21:00,382
- Why don't you screw off, you old bastard?
- What?

198
00:21:04,637 --> 00:21:07,681
Son, now I don't wanna
work myself short of breath.

199
00:21:07,765 --> 00:21:11,060
You wanna continue this?
It can be over all at once.

200
00:21:11,143 --> 00:21:14,063
Because that's how goddamn fast
your life can change.

201
00:21:14,146 --> 00:21:16,106
You believe me?

202
00:21:20,987 --> 00:21:23,197
Sorry for the mess.

203
00:21:45,178 --> 00:21:47,180
- Hi.
- Hi.

204
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:56,565
My name's Griff.

205
00:21:56,606 --> 00:21:58,525
My name is Mitch.

206
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:01,236
That for me?

207
00:22:09,452 --> 00:22:10,871
Thank you.

208
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:17,460
Yeah, I know.

209
00:22:17,543 --> 00:22:21,172
I almost threw up
first time I looked at it.

210
00:22:21,255 --> 00:22:23,717
You feeling a little queasy?

211
00:22:23,758 --> 00:22:25,802
I'm fine.

212
00:22:25,885 --> 00:22:27,762
OK.

213
00:22:28,805 --> 00:22:32,058
I got queasy first time
I saw a man eat a snail.

214
00:22:32,141 --> 00:22:34,769
- You ever eat a snail?
- No.

215
00:22:35,353 --> 00:22:37,898
Me neither.
This looks good.

216
00:22:42,445 --> 00:22:46,824
- What happened to you?
- I was mauled by a bear.

217
00:22:47,408 --> 00:22:49,535
I saw a bear in a cage yesterday.

218
00:22:49,577 --> 00:22:51,662
Yeah. That was my bear.

219
00:22:53,414 --> 00:22:57,626
About a year ago, he was eating
one of your grandfather's calves

220
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:02,673
and... well, we sort of
interrupted his dinner, you know.

221
00:23:02,757 --> 00:23:05,802
He thought we were
gonna take it away from him.

222
00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:08,595
You know bears -
they don't like to share.

223
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:12,892
Did the bear bite Einar?

224
00:23:13,601 --> 00:23:16,103
No, I was closer.

225
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:21,525
- I didn't know anyone ate snails.
- Oh, yeah, sure.

226
00:23:21,608 --> 00:23:24,737
In those fancy restaurants
up in Cheyenne,

227
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:28,949
they eat 'em all the time
like there's nothing to it.

228
00:23:32,161 --> 00:23:34,163
Once I saw this kid eat a moth.

229
00:23:34,997 --> 00:23:38,167
- You could hear the crunch.
- Oh, no, no!

230
00:23:46,092 --> 00:23:48,720
Oh, my gosh! Look at that!

231
00:23:50,305 --> 00:23:52,140
Einar.

232
00:23:52,182 --> 00:23:54,017
Hey, Angie.

233
00:23:54,059 --> 00:23:56,686
I didn't expect to see you in this crowd.

234
00:23:56,769 --> 00:24:01,316
I guess at my age it's good
to be seen just about anywhere.

235
00:24:02,025 --> 00:24:05,070
Well, Fish and Game
said he'd settle down in a few days.

236
00:24:05,153 --> 00:24:09,074
Of course, they also said
he'd eat anything, which he doesn't.

237
00:24:09,157 --> 00:24:16,206
I don't get it. Nobody would pay five dollars
for the mountain lion I used to keep in here.

238
00:24:16,289 --> 00:24:18,333
How's Mitch?

239
00:24:18,374 --> 00:24:20,710
He's dreaming about the sea.

240
00:24:21,586 --> 00:24:23,463
I always wanted a boat.

241
00:24:23,505 --> 00:24:26,300
My dad used to take us out.
It was so great.

242
00:24:26,383 --> 00:24:28,468
What happened to the lion?

243
00:24:29,427 --> 00:24:31,346
He died.

244
00:24:33,431 --> 00:24:35,475
Lucky lion.

245
00:24:43,358 --> 00:24:45,360
Hello, Griffin.

246
00:24:59,959 --> 00:25:04,630
Well, it says here you might have
already won $15 million.

247
00:25:05,423 --> 00:25:08,425
Probably ought to
send it in for you, though.

248
00:25:08,509 --> 00:25:12,388
Probably the same damn odds
as losing a kid early.

249
00:25:12,472 --> 00:25:14,348
You got that done.

250
00:25:17,769 --> 00:25:20,646
You should know
your wife came back.

251
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:30,865
You could have steered her
someplace else.

252
00:25:30,948 --> 00:25:35,577
Just 'cause you're dead
doesn't mean you can't be useful.

253
00:25:38,039 --> 00:25:40,208
See you tomorrow, boy.

254
00:25:44,295 --> 00:25:47,757
Kid sure looks a whole lot
like you, though.

255
00:25:49,175 --> 00:25:51,093
Top to bottom.

256
00:25:54,639 --> 00:25:56,599
Mom!

257
00:25:57,558 --> 00:25:59,435
- Hey!
- I missed you.

258
00:25:59,518 --> 00:26:01,311
- Guess what. I got a job.
- Really?

259
00:26:01,395 --> 00:26:04,357
I start tomorrow.
So how was your day?

260
00:26:06,317 --> 00:26:08,027
Not so great, huh?

261
00:26:57,077 --> 00:26:58,954
Man, I'm tired.

262
00:27:00,121 --> 00:27:05,001
I think half the people we served
this morning came in just to look at you.

263
00:27:05,085 --> 00:27:07,462
Here you go.

264
00:27:07,545 --> 00:27:10,507
- What's this?
- Your half of the tips.

265
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:16,387
I thought you said
you were used to being on your feet.

266
00:27:16,471 --> 00:27:20,601
I'm not used to telling everyone I meet
where I've been the last ten years.

267
00:27:20,642 --> 00:27:22,144
Well...

268
00:27:22,227 --> 00:27:23,938
Tell 'em you went crazy.

269
00:27:24,856 --> 00:27:27,358
Tell 'em you've been locked up.

270
00:27:29,068 --> 00:27:31,237
That's what I've been telling 'em.

271
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,322
Looks like we did real good today.

272
00:27:33,405 --> 00:27:35,867
Guess I got you to thank for that.

273
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:39,119
Maybe I'll have some music
on Saturday night.

274
00:27:39,202 --> 00:27:44,333
Of course, then again,
you'd have to dance with Billy and Wayne.

275
00:27:44,959 --> 00:27:47,128
Oh, that'd be a sight.

276
00:28:01,934 --> 00:28:03,853
Can I help you?

277
00:28:06,271 --> 00:28:08,440
I'm Einar Gilkyson's daughter-in-law.

278
00:28:08,482 --> 00:28:11,610
Yes, I know.
Did you want to come in?

279
00:28:14,530 --> 00:28:16,615
Thank you.

280
00:28:16,699 --> 00:28:18,617
- Any calls?
- Nothing.

281
00:28:23,246 --> 00:28:25,499
Homemade lunch, you know.

282
00:28:31,965 --> 00:28:35,343
You got something there
you want me to see?

283
00:28:41,516 --> 00:28:45,228
It's a police report.
But I didn't press charges.

284
00:28:45,269 --> 00:28:51,318
A shelter worker in Iowa thought I ought to
check in with authorities when I got settled.

285
00:28:52,443 --> 00:28:55,155
He was my boyfriend.

286
00:28:55,197 --> 00:28:57,282
But, um...

287
00:28:57,365 --> 00:28:59,867
The report's not for this time.

288
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:02,746
It was for another time.

289
00:29:05,916 --> 00:29:08,001
I'll make a copy.

290
00:29:20,013 --> 00:29:21,181
That's it.

291
00:29:26,228 --> 00:29:28,271
What are their names?

292
00:29:29,188 --> 00:29:31,691
- Who?
- Your cats.

293
00:29:32,734 --> 00:29:35,445
They don't have any names.

294
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:39,117
How do you tell 'em apart?

295
00:29:39,992 --> 00:29:41,952
I don't tell 'em apart.

296
00:29:47,958 --> 00:29:51,796
Goddamn cheap-ass, Mickey Mouse,
foreign goddamn part...

297
00:29:51,879 --> 00:29:54,090
Oscar and Charlie.

298
00:29:54,173 --> 00:29:56,175
Hi, Charlie.

299
00:29:56,258 --> 00:29:58,802
Is that there a water-pump belt?

300
00:29:59,762 --> 00:30:02,139
Why don't you use the one
out on the tractor?

301
00:30:02,222 --> 00:30:04,183
Why don't I use the one
out on the tractor?

302
00:30:04,266 --> 00:30:07,353
Hey, are you mumbling
over there or something?

303
00:30:07,436 --> 00:30:09,646
The tractor belt's twice this size.

304
00:30:09,730 --> 00:30:11,482
- Really?
- Yeah.

305
00:30:11,523 --> 00:30:13,400
Oh.

306
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:16,612
Don't we have some
spare belts in the barn?

307
00:30:16,695 --> 00:30:20,532
I got a great idea.
Why don't you go back in the house?

308
00:30:20,616 --> 00:30:25,329
Well, uh, damn. I was...
just trying to be helpful.

309
00:30:25,413 --> 00:30:29,250
If you don't want my help,
I'll just sit over here and shut up.

310
00:30:29,333 --> 00:30:32,336
Pulling that out, it don't look like
you know what you're doing.

311
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:35,630
Just shut up! OK?
Shut up. You don't know what I'm doing.

312
00:30:35,714 --> 00:30:38,175
- You don't know about the truck.
- Who you talking to?

313
00:30:38,259 --> 00:30:42,554
- Stop being a philosopher...
- Doggone second-generation immigrant,

314
00:30:42,638 --> 00:30:45,808
I bet I come over there
and hang my bad foot in your ass.

315
00:30:56,945 --> 00:30:58,905
- Thanks.
- Anytime.

316
00:30:58,988 --> 00:31:01,532
- See you tomorrow?
- Yep. See ya.

317
00:31:02,659 --> 00:31:04,202
- Hey, kiddo.
- Hey.

318
00:31:04,285 --> 00:31:06,246
- How was it?
- All right.

319
00:31:07,247 --> 00:31:10,625
- See ya, Einar.
- Got some groceries for dinner.

320
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:15,088
OK.

321
00:31:17,924 --> 00:31:20,702
- Do you wanna take these inside, sweetie?
- Sure.

322
00:31:20,802 --> 00:31:22,179
- Got it?
- Yep.

323
00:31:23,471 --> 00:31:26,016
- Hey, Mitch.
- Hey, there.

324
00:31:29,936 --> 00:31:34,023
What happened here?
Why did you stop running cows?

325
00:31:35,358 --> 00:31:37,610
When Griffin died, I ran out of help.

326
00:31:40,197 --> 00:31:43,449
Then I got older, Mitch got mauled,

327
00:31:44,326 --> 00:31:47,496
and I sold the stock to stay on the place.

328
00:31:50,873 --> 00:31:53,376
Dinner will be ready in an hour.

329
00:31:55,712 --> 00:31:57,630
Come here, Sarah.

330
00:31:58,507 --> 00:32:00,801
Nope, stay here.

331
00:32:00,843 --> 00:32:03,095
- You finished?
- Yeah.

332
00:32:03,845 --> 00:32:07,224
Tell your kid to come down
out of that tree.

333
00:32:09,476 --> 00:32:12,104
Come on, Charlie.

334
00:32:12,188 --> 00:32:14,648
Come on.
Don't be a fraidy-cat.

335
00:32:23,199 --> 00:32:24,992
Oh, Jesus.

336
00:32:26,827 --> 00:32:28,704
I'm sorry.

337
00:32:28,787 --> 00:32:32,458
You're sorry, huh?
Well, that's just fine, then.

338
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:37,213
- I'll buy you a new one.
- Oh. Just that easy?

339
00:32:38,797 --> 00:32:43,469
Maybe I liked that plate. In fact, maybe
that was my favorite goddamn plate!

340
00:32:43,552 --> 00:32:45,554
- It's just a plate.
- That's it, huh?

341
00:32:45,596 --> 00:32:49,058
Did it ever occur to you
that not everything can be replaced?

342
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:58,567
Come down out of that tree!

343
00:33:05,449 --> 00:33:09,829
- You want this on the table?
- No, over here. Thank you.

344
00:33:12,791 --> 00:33:15,126
I'm so glad you're back, Jean.

345
00:33:23,802 --> 00:33:26,012
What happened to Nellie?

346
00:33:28,222 --> 00:33:30,308
Nellie left.

347
00:33:30,391 --> 00:33:33,353
About a year after we buried Griffin.

348
00:33:34,563 --> 00:33:37,440
Einar just never got a handle on it.

349
00:33:37,523 --> 00:33:41,194
And then, when he hardly
even noticed Nellie anymore, why...

350
00:33:41,277 --> 00:33:44,239
She found another man.
Who wouldn't?

351
00:33:45,407 --> 00:33:47,742
Think they live in Colorado.

352
00:33:49,161 --> 00:33:53,164
Do you think he blames me
for losing his wife too?

353
00:33:53,248 --> 00:33:55,125
I imagine he does.

354
00:34:05,092 --> 00:34:07,596
I don't want to stay here.

355
00:34:09,889 --> 00:34:11,808
What's wrong with him?

356
00:34:12,516 --> 00:34:14,603
Well, it's not you.

357
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,730
He just never got over it.

358
00:34:19,358 --> 00:34:23,487
He really loved your dad.
You should know that.

359
00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:25,865
- Did you?
- Of course.

360
00:34:28,367 --> 00:34:30,786
You do have a plan, though, right?

361
00:34:30,869 --> 00:34:33,539
I mean, we don't have to stay here forever?

362
00:34:33,581 --> 00:34:35,791
Sure, I do.

363
00:34:35,833 --> 00:34:39,670
Soon as I earn enough money,
I'm gonna get us right out of here.

364
00:34:39,753 --> 00:34:42,965
You know what?
What do you think about...

365
00:34:43,007 --> 00:34:44,925
Butt, Montana?

366
00:34:49,555 --> 00:34:53,058
Come on, let's play.
You don't know how to read anymore?

367
00:34:55,936 --> 00:34:57,563
Where'd the bottle come from?

368
00:34:58,814 --> 00:35:00,691
The granary.

369
00:35:00,775 --> 00:35:04,194
It's been there for a while.
Sometimes I just like to look at it.

370
00:35:04,278 --> 00:35:06,197
15, two.

371
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,574
You gonna open it?

372
00:35:08,616 --> 00:35:10,868
I'm not sure yet. 25.

373
00:35:10,951 --> 00:35:13,496
31 for two. Go.

374
00:35:14,705 --> 00:35:17,124
- Did you check on the bear?
- Eight.

375
00:35:17,166 --> 00:35:19,835
Yeah, you asked me to, didn't you?

376
00:35:20,585 --> 00:35:22,462
Here's a pair for two.

377
00:35:23,297 --> 00:35:25,382
I want you to feed him.

378
00:35:26,384 --> 00:35:28,428
- What?
- I want you to feed the bear.

379
00:35:28,512 --> 00:35:31,890
I don't trust Angie to feed
anything much past herself.

380
00:35:31,973 --> 00:35:35,852
"Feed the bear." "Please feed the bear."
"Bear, do you like bear shoes?"

381
00:35:35,936 --> 00:35:40,440
"What kind of food do you like, Bear?
Steak, chicken?"

382
00:35:40,523 --> 00:35:42,442
- Einar.
- What?

383
00:35:43,401 --> 00:35:45,528
Is her being here gonna ruin you?

384
00:35:47,864 --> 00:35:51,034
- The woman killed my son.
- Oh, come on.

385
00:35:51,117 --> 00:35:55,329
It was a car accident. They call them
accidents because it's nobody's fault.

386
00:35:55,413 --> 00:35:59,626
No, they call them accidents
to make the guilty feel better.

387
00:35:59,709 --> 00:36:03,004
- Is that so?
- I don't give a damn what they call them.

388
00:36:03,046 --> 00:36:04,965
My son's dead.

389
00:36:06,132 --> 00:36:08,051
Your granddaughter's not.

390
00:36:08,134 --> 00:36:10,052
And neither were you.

391
00:36:11,012 --> 00:36:15,308
Have you thought about
how she's gonna remember you?

392
00:36:16,143 --> 00:36:21,565
You know, come to think of it,
I don't feel like playing cards tonight.

393
00:36:21,606 --> 00:36:25,193
Put that bottle someplace
where I don't have to look at it.

394
00:37:21,625 --> 00:37:24,795
You know anything about pickup trucks?

395
00:37:26,839 --> 00:37:28,340
Aw, shit.

396
00:37:28,424 --> 00:37:32,844
Hand me that half-inch
socket wrench, would you?

397
00:37:32,886 --> 00:37:35,389
No, no, no.
Shiny one on the top.

398
00:37:36,181 --> 00:37:37,766
Yep.

399
00:37:38,934 --> 00:37:41,437
Do you wanna see what I'm doing?

400
00:37:45,607 --> 00:37:47,526
That's it.

401
00:37:49,278 --> 00:37:51,447
- OK, see these screws here?
- Mm-hm.

402
00:37:51,490 --> 00:37:56,244
This one I'm tightening, this holds
this thing up which holds the pan up.

403
00:37:56,327 --> 00:37:59,998
If this thing comes loose when you're
driving, you'll be sitting on the road.

404
00:38:00,081 --> 00:38:02,834
And that's not what you want to be doing...

405
00:38:02,876 --> 00:38:04,961
How come you and Einar don't get along?

406
00:38:05,045 --> 00:38:07,463
You're practically his daughter.

407
00:38:07,547 --> 00:38:10,008
What I am is his dead son's wife.

408
00:38:11,676 --> 00:38:16,056
He's always been really good to me.
He's the first friend I met here.

409
00:38:17,807 --> 00:38:20,560
I am not in the mood for their crap.

410
00:38:21,603 --> 00:38:22,771
I'll take 'em.

411
00:38:24,648 --> 00:38:28,693
- The special today is the enchilada plate.
- Thank you.

412
00:38:28,777 --> 00:38:32,572
They're good enchiladas.
Served by good people.

413
00:38:33,447 --> 00:38:35,366
I'm a good person.

414
00:38:36,326 --> 00:38:40,997
I'm also a woman who's taken more
than her fair share of shit off men.

415
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:43,041
Don't push me.

416
00:38:43,124 --> 00:38:47,212
I mean, I couldn't even take a pinch of crap
from two little cheesedicks like you.

417
00:38:47,295 --> 00:38:50,965
OK, crank it.

418
00:38:51,007 --> 00:38:52,926
Again.

419
00:38:53,926 --> 00:38:55,261
Again.

420
00:39:04,063 --> 00:39:06,190
Take your foot off the gas.

421
00:39:07,191 --> 00:39:09,318
Take your foot off the gas!

422
00:39:15,824 --> 00:39:17,994
Is that for lunch?

423
00:39:18,077 --> 00:39:20,371
It's for a bear.

424
00:39:20,454 --> 00:39:23,791
Who the hell knows
what a bear eats anyway?

425
00:39:37,638 --> 00:39:39,723
Did I ask you to do that?

426
00:39:40,724 --> 00:39:42,726
Don't bears like honey?

427
00:39:42,768 --> 00:39:44,853
Winnie the Pooh does.

428
00:40:01,828 --> 00:40:03,663
- Oh, hey.
- Thought you were sick.

429
00:40:03,747 --> 00:40:06,166
Haven't seen you for a few days.

430
00:40:06,208 --> 00:40:11,465
It's only a two-restaurant town, so I try
to spread the county's money around.

431
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:15,635
Meatloaf. Can I have onion rings
instead of mashed potatoes?

432
00:40:15,677 --> 00:40:18,429
Onion... Sure, I'll ask.

433
00:40:21,557 --> 00:40:23,809
Could you give me a ride home after work?

434
00:40:24,936 --> 00:40:26,354
Sure.

435
00:40:30,025 --> 00:40:32,235
He looks like he's dancing.

436
00:40:32,318 --> 00:40:35,113
Well, maybe just happy to see
a girl with a sack of meat.

437
00:40:35,197 --> 00:40:38,574
I'll give you some here.
Why don't you toss this in?

438
00:40:51,045 --> 00:40:54,757
- He likes the honey.
- I think he does.

439
00:40:54,841 --> 00:40:58,928
Is that really the bear
that hurt Mr. Bradley?

440
00:40:58,969 --> 00:41:01,181
He's the one.

441
00:41:17,447 --> 00:41:19,450
I don't wanna go right home.

442
00:41:19,492 --> 00:41:21,827
- Not just yet.
- You don't?

443
00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:24,288
Can't we just drive a little?

444
00:41:35,007 --> 00:41:38,052
Here's the thing.
I'm gonna be here about three more weeks.

445
00:41:38,135 --> 00:41:40,721
I'm afraid I'm not gonna get through it.

446
00:41:43,224 --> 00:41:45,226
Three weeks, huh?

447
00:41:47,811 --> 00:41:50,355
I don't wanna be in love, Crane.

448
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:17,049
Don't start without me.

449
00:42:20,302 --> 00:42:23,305
- What's that?
- A flower.

450
00:42:23,346 --> 00:42:25,348
That's not a flower - it's a weed.

451
00:42:28,144 --> 00:42:30,146
It's pretty, though.

452
00:42:30,229 --> 00:42:34,818
- Don't you think it's pretty?
- Yeah, I think it's lovely.

453
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:37,278
You want to wait a little longer
for your mother?

454
00:42:37,362 --> 00:42:39,739
- Just a little bit.
- OK.

455
00:42:45,286 --> 00:42:47,789
I had a music teacher
who was a lesbian.

456
00:42:55,255 --> 00:42:57,465
You guys are gay, right?

457
00:43:03,346 --> 00:43:07,183
I'd think after 40 years of working together,
one of us would notice, don't you?

458
00:43:07,266 --> 00:43:11,563
Well, Einar, I always thought
you had really lovely hands.

459
00:43:11,646 --> 00:43:14,524
You did? You never told me that.

460
00:43:14,607 --> 00:43:18,110
I mean, it's cool.
Everybody needs love.

461
00:43:18,194 --> 00:43:20,446
You got that part right, little girl.

462
00:43:21,531 --> 00:43:23,741
Jeez, what's next?

463
00:43:24,451 --> 00:43:26,244
Hey!

464
00:43:28,163 --> 00:43:31,833
- Hey, yourself. How you doing?
- Good. How are you?

465
00:43:31,916 --> 00:43:35,545
Good. There's somebody
I want you to meet.

466
00:43:36,796 --> 00:43:39,592
Griff, this is Sheriff Curtis.

467
00:43:39,675 --> 00:43:41,719
Nice to meet you, Griff.

468
00:43:43,178 --> 00:43:46,139
- Are you hungry?
- There isn't enough.

469
00:43:46,223 --> 00:43:50,436
I gotta swing back
through town anyway. So I'll see ya.

470
00:43:50,519 --> 00:43:54,189
- Thanks for the ride home.
- Take care of yourself, Crane.

471
00:43:55,775 --> 00:43:57,735
- I don't like him.
- I don't remember asking.

472
00:43:57,818 --> 00:43:59,820
I don't remember you ever asking me.

473
00:43:59,903 --> 00:44:02,656
Hey, I don't need your permission.

474
00:44:06,076 --> 00:44:09,079
You confused about how
to treat a guest in my house?

475
00:44:09,121 --> 00:44:11,123
It's just some guy my mom brought home.

476
00:44:11,206 --> 00:44:14,918
I expect you to be pleasant
to whoever comes to my door.

477
00:44:19,757 --> 00:44:21,007
Yes, sir.

478
00:44:21,091 --> 00:44:24,469
Unless it's some guy
looking to sell his angle on God.

479
00:44:24,553 --> 00:44:27,639
There's no excuse for that bullshit.

480
00:44:30,559 --> 00:44:36,398
Well, all right, then. Let's give a try
at these good-looking sandwiches.

481
00:45:00,882 --> 00:45:03,384
There you go.
Hold it right about here.

482
00:45:03,467 --> 00:45:04,594
OK.

483
00:45:04,677 --> 00:45:09,391
- His foot's not gonna go anywhere.
- Oh, yes, it is. Look at that calf run.

484
00:45:09,432 --> 00:45:11,267
He's off and gone.

485
00:45:13,061 --> 00:45:16,105
Oops. That's a little bit low.

486
00:45:19,984 --> 00:45:22,570
- Yeah!
- I got it!

487
00:45:23,989 --> 00:45:26,432
- Look at that!
- Oh, yeah.

488
00:45:26,532 --> 00:45:30,036
Go on, try it again.
There you go.

489
00:45:34,623 --> 00:45:38,085
You got any more improvements
you wanna make around here?

490
00:45:38,169 --> 00:45:40,212
I thought I'd
straighten some of this mess.

491
00:45:40,254 --> 00:45:42,507
Thought Mitch might
want to work on something.

492
00:45:42,590 --> 00:45:46,344
- Did you ask him about it?
- Well, of course she did.

493
00:45:47,303 --> 00:45:50,264
Now that we've got interesting
company around here, I...

494
00:45:50,348 --> 00:45:52,391
I feel inspired.

495
00:45:54,935 --> 00:45:57,355
Excuse me.
I gotta go to work.

496
00:46:10,286 --> 00:46:12,246
You wanna know
what I dreamed last night?

497
00:46:12,329 --> 00:46:14,273
What?

498
00:46:14,373 --> 00:46:18,502
I dreamed you weren't
such a miserable son of a bitch.

499
00:46:19,295 --> 00:46:23,173
That's not dreaming.
That's wishful thinking.

500
00:46:24,049 --> 00:46:27,886
Did you hear anything
unusual last night?

501
00:46:27,969 --> 00:46:31,807
Yeah. Somebody poking around
down by the river.

502
00:46:33,141 --> 00:46:35,226
I found some footprints.

503
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:38,272
This.

504
00:46:45,737 --> 00:46:47,781
I sure do miss smoking.

505
00:46:48,741 --> 00:46:50,617
So do I.

506
00:46:58,917 --> 00:46:59,960
Hey.

507
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:03,880
Hey! What are you doing here?

508
00:47:03,964 --> 00:47:07,301
- We're going to Angie's zoo.
- Really?

509
00:47:07,385 --> 00:47:09,429
What kind of pies you got today, Nina?

510
00:47:09,512 --> 00:47:13,141
Hey! I got three kinds of berry
and chocolate pecan.

511
00:47:13,224 --> 00:47:16,102
Guaranteed to make your teeth ache.

512
00:47:16,186 --> 00:47:19,648
Chocolate pecan, please.
With ice cream.

513
00:47:19,689 --> 00:47:22,817
Two chocolate pecan, one with ice cream.
Kid's got young teeth.

514
00:47:23,817 --> 00:47:33,817
