0
00:00:49,249 --> 00:00:52,582
- Is everything in place?
- You weren't supposed to relieve me.

1
00:00:52,786 --> 00:00:55,482
I know, but I felt like taking a shift.

2
00:00:55,955 --> 00:00:58,446
You like him, don't you?
You like watching him.

3
00:00:58,625 --> 00:01:01,753
- Don't be ridiculous.
- We're gonna kill him. You understand?

4
00:01:01,928 --> 00:01:04,419
Morpheus believes he is the One.

5
00:01:04,631 --> 00:01:07,589
- Do you?
- It doesn't matter what I believe.

6
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:09,428
You don't, do you?

7
00:01:09,636 --> 00:01:11,797
- Did you hear that?
- Hear what?

8
00:01:11,971 --> 00:01:13,666
Are you sure this line is clean?

9
00:01:13,873 --> 00:01:15,864
Yeah, of course I'm sure.

10
00:01:16,209 --> 00:01:17,642
I better go.

11
00:01:55,482 --> 00:01:57,370
- Freeze! Police!
- Hands on your head!

12
00:01:57,817 --> 00:01:59,045
Do it! Do it now!

13
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,068
- Lieutenant.
- Oh, shit.

14
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:27,107
Lieutenant, you were given
specific orders.

15
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:29,076
Hey, I'm just doing my job.

16
00:02:29,682 --> 00:02:34,107
You give me that "juris-my-dick-tion"
crap, you can cram it up your ass.

17
00:02:34,587 --> 00:02:37,078
The orders were for your protection.

18
00:02:38,591 --> 00:02:40,786
I think we can handle one little girl.

19
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:47,696
I sent two units!

20
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:49,493
They're bringing her down now!

21
00:02:49,702 --> 00:02:52,830
No, Lieutenant, your men are
already dead.

22
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:23,024
Shit.

23
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:28,029
Morpheus, the line was traced.
I don't know how.

24
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,869
I know. They cut the hard line.

25
00:03:30,076 --> 00:03:32,306
There's no time.
Get to another exit.

26
00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:34,935
- Are there any agents?
- Yes.

27
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:36,376
Goddamn it.

28
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:38,141
You have to focus, Trinity.

29
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:40,740
There's a phone at Wells and Lake.

30
00:03:41,154 --> 00:03:42,815
You can make it.

31
00:03:43,022 --> 00:03:44,683
- All right.
- Go.

32
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:47,947
That's impossible.

33
00:05:22,855 --> 00:05:24,880
Get up, Trinity.
Just get up.

34
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:26,753
Get up.

35
00:06:12,638 --> 00:06:14,162
She got out.

36
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:15,771
It doesn't matter.

37
00:06:15,975 --> 00:06:18,068
The informant is real.

38
00:06:19,278 --> 00:06:22,975
- We have the name of their next target.
- The name is Neo.

39
00:06:26,252 --> 00:06:27,776
We'll need a search running.

40
00:06:28,087 --> 00:06:30,009
It has already begun.

41
00:07:24,744 --> 00:07:25,972
What?

42
00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:33,241
What the hell?

43
00:07:40,893 --> 00:07:42,815
"Follow the white rabbit."

44
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,868
Who is it?

45
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:57,407
It's Choi.

46
00:08:10,857 --> 00:08:12,085
You're two hours late.

47
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:15,650
- I know. It's her fault.
- You got the money?

48
00:08:17,697 --> 00:08:18,925
Two grand.

49
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:20,927
Hold on.

50
00:08:38,618 --> 00:08:39,983
Hallelujah.

51
00:08:40,286 --> 00:08:43,141
You're my savior, man.
My own personal Jesus Christ.

52
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:44,914
You get caught using that...

53
00:08:45,091 --> 00:08:47,651
I know. This never happened.
You don't exist.

54
00:08:48,761 --> 00:08:50,854
- Right.
- Something wrong, man?

55
00:08:51,063 --> 00:08:53,088
You look a little whiter than usual.

56
00:08:54,233 --> 00:08:56,394
My computer, it...

57
00:08:59,405 --> 00:09:04,661
You ever have that feeling where you're
not sure if you're awake or still dreaming?

58
00:09:04,844 --> 00:09:07,540
All the time.
It's called mescaline.

59
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:10,174
It's the only way to fly.

60
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:14,113
Hey, look, it just sounds like
you might need to unplug, man.

61
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:16,278
You know? Get some R and R?

62
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:20,420
What do you think, Dujour?
Should we take him with us?

63
00:09:22,428 --> 00:09:23,725
Definitely.

64
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:27,093
No, I can't. I have work tomorrow.

65
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:28,795
Come on.

66
00:09:29,001 --> 00:09:31,629
It'll be fun. I promise.

67
00:09:38,144 --> 00:09:39,634
Yeah.

68
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:42,310
Sure. I'll go.

69
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:11,703
Hello, Neo.

70
00:10:12,511 --> 00:10:14,069
How do you know that name?

71
00:10:14,246 --> 00:10:16,043
I know a lot about you.

72
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:19,042
- Who are you?
- My name is Trinity.

73
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:21,180
Trinity.

74
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:26,186
The Trinity?
That cracked the IRS D-base?

75
00:10:26,392 --> 00:10:27,916
That was a long time ago.

76
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:29,992
- Jesus.
- What?

77
00:10:30,496 --> 00:10:32,259
I just thought...

78
00:10:34,066 --> 00:10:36,921
...you were a guy.
- Most guys do.

79
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:40,332
That was you on my computer.

80
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:45,433
- How did you do that?
- Right now, all I can tell you...

81
00:10:46,012 --> 00:10:47,604
...is that you're in danger.

82
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:50,505
- I brought you here to warn you.
- Of what?

83
00:10:51,017 --> 00:10:52,746
They're watching you, Neo.

84
00:10:53,452 --> 00:10:55,716
- Who is?
- Please, just listen.

85
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:01,090
I know why you're here, Neo.

86
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:03,852
I know what you've been doing.

87
00:11:04,096 --> 00:11:05,927
I know why you hardly sleep...

88
00:11:06,265 --> 00:11:09,393
...why you live alone, and why,
night after night...

89
00:11:09,602 --> 00:11:11,934
...you sit at your computer.

90
00:11:13,105 --> 00:11:14,663
You're looking for him.

91
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:18,468
I know, because I was once
looking for the same thing.

92
00:11:18,978 --> 00:11:21,071
And when he found me...

93
00:11:21,714 --> 00:11:24,740
...he told me I wasn't really
looking for him...

94
00:11:25,718 --> 00:11:27,447
...I was looking for an answer.

95
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:31,215
It's the question that drives us, Neo.

96
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:34,553
It's the question
that brought you here.

97
00:11:36,662 --> 00:11:37,993
You know the question...

98
00:11:38,297 --> 00:11:39,787
...just as I did.

99
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,961
What is the Matrix?

100
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:45,660
The answer is out there, Neo.

101
00:11:46,305 --> 00:11:48,261
It's looking for you.

102
00:11:49,141 --> 00:11:50,768
And it will find you...

103
00:11:51,077 --> 00:11:53,068
...if you want it to.

104
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:00,783
Shit.

105
00:12:00,953 --> 00:12:02,181
Shit, shit.

106
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:15,320
You have a problem with authority,
Mr. Anderson.

107
00:12:15,534 --> 00:12:19,561
You believe that you are special,
that somehow the rules do not apply to you.

108
00:12:20,306 --> 00:12:22,331
Obviously, you are mistaken.

109
00:12:25,177 --> 00:12:28,135
This is one of the top
software companies in the world...

110
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:31,804
...because every employee understands
they are part of a whole.

111
00:12:32,017 --> 00:12:36,613
Thus, if an employee has a problem,
the company has a problem.

112
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:42,121
The time has come to make
a choice, Mr. Anderson.

113
00:12:43,028 --> 00:12:46,850
Either you choose to be at your desk
on time from this day forth...

114
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:50,058
...or you choose to find yourself
another job.

115
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:52,335
Do I make myself clear?

116
00:12:52,538 --> 00:12:54,733
Yes, Mr. Rhineheart.
Perfectly clear.

117
00:13:03,415 --> 00:13:05,007
Thomas Anderson?

118
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:07,985
Yeah, that's me.

119
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:17,156
Great.

120
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:19,759
Have a nice day.

121
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:37,572
- Hello?
- Hello, Neo.

122
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,843
Do you know who this is?

123
00:13:42,121 --> 00:13:43,918
- Morpheus.
- Yes.

124
00:13:44,123 --> 00:13:46,148
I've been looking for you, Neo.

125
00:13:46,358 --> 00:13:49,589
I don't know if you're ready to see
what I want to show you...

126
00:13:49,795 --> 00:13:53,026
...but, unfortunately, you and I
have run out of time.

127
00:13:53,232 --> 00:13:56,998
They're coming for you, Neo,
and I don't know what they're going to do.

128
00:13:57,203 --> 00:13:58,568
Who's coming for me?

129
00:13:58,771 --> 00:14:00,898
Stand up and see for yourself.

130
00:14:01,106 --> 00:14:02,630
What? Right now?

131
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:05,435
Yes. Now.

132
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:08,133
Do it slowly.

133
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:09,809
The elevator.

134
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,575
- Oh, shit!
- Yes.

135
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,889
- What do they want?
- I don't know.

136
00:14:23,062 --> 00:14:26,054
But if you don't want to find out,
get out of there.

137
00:14:26,265 --> 00:14:27,527
- How?
- I can guide you...

138
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,362
...but you must do exactly
as I say.

139
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:33,164
- Okay.
- The cubicle across from you is empty.

140
00:14:36,308 --> 00:14:38,435
- But what if they...?
- Go. Now.

141
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:47,583
Stay here for just a moment.

142
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:57,557
When I tell you,
go to the end of the row...

143
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,789
...to the office
at the end of the hall.

144
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:02,365
Stay as low as you can.

145
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:05,798
Go. Now.

146
00:15:20,286 --> 00:15:23,744
Good. Now, outside
there is a scaffold.

147
00:15:26,392 --> 00:15:28,815
- How do you know all this?
- We don't have time.

148
00:15:29,028 --> 00:15:31,883
To your left there's a window.
Go to it.

149
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:35,623
Open it.

150
00:15:36,468 --> 00:15:38,333
Use the scaffold to get
to the roof.

151
00:15:38,537 --> 00:15:41,165
No way! No way!
This is crazy!

152
00:15:41,373 --> 00:15:43,762
There are two ways
out of this building.

153
00:15:43,976 --> 00:15:47,867
One is that scaffold.
The other is in their custody.

154
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:51,243
You take a chance either way.
I leave it to you.

155
00:15:54,887 --> 00:15:56,582
This is insane!

156
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,621
Why is this happening to me?

157
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,586
What'd I do?

158
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,725
I'm nobody.
I didn't do anything.

159
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:06,787
I'm gonna die.

160
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:17,703
Shit!

161
00:16:37,796 --> 00:16:39,024
Oh, shit!

162
00:16:43,969 --> 00:16:45,698
I can't do this.

163
00:16:58,484 --> 00:16:59,473
Shit.

164
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:53,490
As you can see, we've had our eye
on you for some time now, Mr. Anderson.

165
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,468
It seems that you've been living...

166
00:17:57,709 --> 00:17:59,836
...two lives.

167
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,805
In one life,
you're Thomas A. Anderson...

168
00:18:04,016 --> 00:18:07,372
...program writer for a respectable
software company.

169
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:11,719
You have a social security number.
You pay your taxes.

170
00:18:12,124 --> 00:18:13,421
And you...

171
00:18:14,993 --> 00:18:18,622
...help your landlady
carry out her garbage.

172
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:24,261
The other life is lived in computers...

173
00:18:24,503 --> 00:18:27,529
...where you go by
the hacker alias "Neo"...

174
00:18:27,739 --> 00:18:32,563
...and are guilty of virtually every
computer crime we have a law for.

175
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:35,835
One of these lives...

176
00:18:36,048 --> 00:18:37,913
...has a future.

177
00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:40,173
And one of them does not.

178
00:18:43,922 --> 00:18:47,744
I'm going to be as forthcoming
as I can be, Mr. Anderson.

179
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:50,125
You're here...

180
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:52,657
...because we need your help.

181
00:18:56,335 --> 00:18:59,395
We know that you've been contacted
by a certain...

182
00:18:59,605 --> 00:19:01,368
...individual.

183
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:06,301
A man who calls himself "Morpheus."

184
00:19:07,346 --> 00:19:11,339
Whatever you think you know
about this man is irrelevant.

185
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:14,075
He is considered by many authorities...

186
00:19:14,286 --> 00:19:17,278
...to be the most dangerous man alive.

187
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:21,220
My colleagues...

188
00:19:21,693 --> 00:19:24,617
...believe that I am wasting
my time with you.

189
00:19:24,897 --> 00:19:28,287
But I believe you wish
to do the right thing.

190
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:32,127
We're willing to wipe the slate clean...

191
00:19:32,471 --> 00:19:34,564
...give you a fresh start.

192
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:38,064
All that we're asking in return
is your cooperation...

193
00:19:38,277 --> 00:19:41,769
...in bringing
a known terrorist to justice.

194
00:19:43,148 --> 00:19:44,445
Yeah.

195
00:19:45,584 --> 00:19:47,814
Well, that sounds like a really good deal.

196
00:19:49,421 --> 00:19:51,184
But I think I got a better one.

197
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:52,914
How about...

198
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:55,349
...I give you the finger...

199
00:19:57,963 --> 00:19:59,919
...and you give me my phone call.

200
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:03,964
Mr. Anderson...

201
00:20:08,006 --> 00:20:09,234
...you disappoint me.

202
00:20:09,474 --> 00:20:12,102
You can't scare me
with this gestapo crap.

203
00:20:12,311 --> 00:20:13,744
I know my rights.

204
00:20:13,946 --> 00:20:15,436
I want my phone call.

205
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:18,175
Tell me, Mr. Anderson...

206
00:20:19,084 --> 00:20:24,340
...what good is a phone call
if you're unable to speak?

207
00:20:58,123 --> 00:21:00,353
You're going to help us,
Mr. Anderson...

208
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:03,086
...whether you want to or not.

209
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:04,719
This line is tapped,
so I must be brief.

210
00:22:04,923 --> 00:22:09,280
They got to you first, but they've
underestimated how important you are.

211
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:11,325
If they knew what I know...

212
00:22:11,563 --> 00:22:13,554
...you would probably be dead.

213
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:18,330
What are you talking about?
What is happening to me?

214
00:22:18,537 --> 00:22:23,361
You are the One, Neo. You see,
you may have spent the last few years...

215
00:22:23,575 --> 00:22:26,567
...looking for me, but I've spent
my entire life...

216
00:22:26,778 --> 00:22:28,336
...looking for you.

217
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:32,009
Now, do you still want to meet?

218
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:35,851
- Yes.
- Then go to the Adams Street bridge.

219
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:47,259
Get in.

220
00:22:59,611 --> 00:23:02,273
- What the hell is this?
- It's necessary, Neo.

221
00:23:02,447 --> 00:23:04,438
- For our protection.
- From what?

222
00:23:04,683 --> 00:23:06,207
From you.

223
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:08,643
- Take off your shirt.
- What?

224
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:10,711
Stop the car.

225
00:23:14,493 --> 00:23:15,755
Listen to me, coppertop.

226
00:23:15,961 --> 00:23:17,986
We don't have time for 20 Questions.

227
00:23:18,497 --> 00:23:20,795
Right now, there's only one rule:

228
00:23:21,133 --> 00:23:22,464
Our way...

229
00:23:22,634 --> 00:23:23,862
...or the highway.

230
00:23:30,542 --> 00:23:31,531
Fine.

231
00:23:33,378 --> 00:23:35,869
Please, Neo, you have to trust me.

232
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:39,077
- Why?
- Because you have been down there, Neo.

233
00:23:39,818 --> 00:23:41,046
You know that road.

234
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:43,647
You know exactly where it ends.

235
00:23:45,824 --> 00:23:48,088
And I know that's
not where you want to be.

236
00:24:02,307 --> 00:24:03,831
Apoc, lights.

237
00:24:06,411 --> 00:24:08,504
Lie back.
Lift up your shirt.

238
00:24:10,582 --> 00:24:13,415
- What is that thing?
- We think you're bugged.

239
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:21,949
Try and relax.

240
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:29,361
Come on.

241
00:24:30,502 --> 00:24:32,026
Come on.

242
00:24:33,271 --> 00:24:34,863
It's on the move.

243
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:37,236
Come on, you shit.

244
00:24:39,044 --> 00:24:41,376
- You're gonna lose it.
- No, I'm not.

245
00:24:41,546 --> 00:24:43,207
Clear!

246
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:53,287
Jesus Christ! That thing is real?!

247
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:28,322
This is it.

248
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:34,085
Let me give you one piece of advice.

249
00:25:35,133 --> 00:25:36,760
Be honest.

250
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,531
He knows more than you can imagine.

251
00:25:49,314 --> 00:25:50,645
At last.

252
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:53,278
Welcome, Neo.

253
00:25:54,452 --> 00:25:56,374
As you no doubt have guessed...

254
00:25:56,655 --> 00:25:57,883
...I am Morpheus.

255
00:25:58,924 --> 00:26:00,516
It's an honor to meet you.

256
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:02,120
No...

257
00:26:02,594 --> 00:26:03,891
...the honor is mine.

258
00:26:04,796 --> 00:26:07,287
Please, come. Sit.

259
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:24,041
I imagine...

260
00:26:24,449 --> 00:26:27,213
...that right now you're feeling
a bit like Alice.

261
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,309
Tumbling down the rabbit hole?

262
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:33,986
You could say that.

263
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:36,753
I can see it in your eyes.

264
00:26:37,395 --> 00:26:40,694
You have the look of a man
who accepts what he sees...

265
00:26:40,899 --> 00:26:43,197
...because he's expecting to wake up.

266
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:47,163
Ironically, this is not
far from the truth.

267
00:26:47,906 --> 00:26:50,329
Do you believe in fate, Neo?

268
00:26:50,809 --> 00:26:52,936
- No.
- Why not?

269
00:26:53,345 --> 00:26:56,735
Because I don't like the idea that
I'm not in control of my life.

270
00:26:57,082 --> 00:27:00,438
I know exactly what you mean.

271
00:27:04,756 --> 00:27:07,122
Let me tell you why you're here.

272
00:27:07,993 --> 00:27:11,884
You're here because you know something.
What you know, you can't explain.

273
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:13,957
But you feel it.

274
00:27:14,532 --> 00:27:16,454
You felt it your entire life:

275
00:27:17,068 --> 00:27:21,232
There's something wrong with the world.
You don't know what, but it's there.

276
00:27:21,673 --> 00:27:23,971
Like a splinter in your mind...

277
00:27:24,175 --> 00:27:26,040
...driving you mad.

278
00:27:26,945 --> 00:27:29,743
It is this feeling
that has brought you to me.

279
00:27:32,217 --> 00:27:34,082
Do you know what
I'm talking about?

280
00:27:35,954 --> 00:27:37,251
The Matrix?

281
00:27:39,724 --> 00:27:41,419
Do you want to know...

282
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,887
...what it is?

283
00:27:46,297 --> 00:27:48,185
The Matrix is everywhere.

284
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,163
It is all around us.

285
00:27:50,368 --> 00:27:52,324
Even now, in this very room.

286
00:27:53,071 --> 00:27:55,494
You can see it when you
look out your window...

287
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:57,972
...or when you turn on your television.

288
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:00,937
You can feel it when you go to work...

289
00:28:02,414 --> 00:28:04,143
...when you go to church...

290
00:28:04,549 --> 00:28:06,642
...when you pay your taxes.

291
00:28:07,719 --> 00:28:10,677
It is the world that has been
pulled over your eyes...

292
00:28:10,889 --> 00:28:12,516
...to blind you from the truth.

293
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:15,990
What truth?

294
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:22,894
That you are a slave, Neo.

295
00:28:23,068 --> 00:28:25,593
Like everyone else,
you were born into bondage...

296
00:28:25,837 --> 00:28:30,467
...born into a prison that you cannot
smell or taste or touch.

297
00:28:30,809 --> 00:28:33,437
A prison for your mind.

298
00:28:40,452 --> 00:28:42,818
Unfortunately, no one can be...

299
00:28:43,088 --> 00:28:45,511
...told what the Matrix is.

300
00:28:48,993 --> 00:28:50,790
You have to see it for yourself.

301
00:29:00,371 --> 00:29:02,635
This is your last chance.

302
00:29:02,841 --> 00:29:05,207
After this, there is no turning back.

303
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:07,143
You take the blue pill...

304
00:29:07,479 --> 00:29:10,573
...the story ends, you wake up
in your bed and believe...

305
00:29:10,782 --> 00:29:12,579
...whatever you want to believe.

306
00:29:12,817 --> 00:29:14,148
You take the red pill...

307
00:29:14,352 --> 00:29:16,308
...you stay in Wonderland...

308
00:29:16,888 --> 00:29:19,550
...and I show you how deep
the rabbit hole goes.

309
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:30,662
Remember...

310
00:29:31,503 --> 00:29:34,495
...all I'm offering is the truth.
Nothing more.

311
00:29:48,887 --> 00:29:50,184
Follow me.

312
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:54,453
Apoc, are we online?

313
00:29:54,659 --> 00:29:56,024
Almost.

314
00:29:59,397 --> 00:30:01,422
Time is always against us.

315
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,290
Please, take a seat there.

316
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:23,147
You did all this?

317
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:29,987
The pill you took is
part of a trace program.

318
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:34,689
It disrupts your input/output carrier signals
so we can pinpoint your location.

319
00:30:35,099 --> 00:30:36,327
What does that mean?

320
00:30:36,868 --> 00:30:39,029
It means buckle
your seat belt, Dorothy...

321
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:41,964
...because Kansas is going bye-bye.

322
00:31:19,911 --> 00:31:21,310
Did you...?

323
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:36,386
Have you ever had a dream, Neo,
that you were so sure was real?

324
00:31:37,862 --> 00:31:40,422
What if you were unable
to wake from that dream?

325
00:31:40,632 --> 00:31:43,760
How would you know the difference
between the dream world...

326
00:31:43,935 --> 00:31:45,232
...and the real world?

327
00:31:46,938 --> 00:31:49,236
- This can't be.
- Be what?

328
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:51,432
Be real?

329
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:56,903
It's going into replication.

330
00:31:57,048 --> 00:31:58,538
Still nothing.

331
00:31:58,716 --> 00:32:01,446
It's cold. It's cold!

332
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:07,918
Tank, we're going to need a signal soon.

333
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:09,423
I got a fibrillation.

334
00:32:09,627 --> 00:32:11,185
Apoc, location.

335
00:32:11,396 --> 00:32:12,886
Targeting almost there.

336
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,599
He's going into arrest.

337
00:32:17,802 --> 00:32:19,690
- Lock. I got him!
- Now, Tank, now!

338
00:35:17,582 --> 00:35:18,879
Welcome...

339
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:20,938
...to the real world.

340
00:35:22,386 --> 00:35:24,217
We've done it, Trinity.

341
00:35:24,422 --> 00:35:26,014
We found him.

342
00:35:26,224 --> 00:35:29,057
- I hope you're right.
- I don't have to hope.

343
00:35:29,594 --> 00:35:31,186
I know it.

344
00:35:36,234 --> 00:35:37,462
Am I dead?

345
00:35:37,869 --> 00:35:40,030
Far from it.

346
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:55,509
He still needs a lot of work.

347
00:35:56,888 --> 00:35:58,116
What are you doing?

348
00:35:58,289 --> 00:36:01,087
Your muscles have atrophied.
We're rebuilding them.

349
00:36:01,259 --> 00:36:02,692
Why do my eyes hurt?

350
00:36:03,394 --> 00:36:05,282
You've never used them before.

351
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,998
Rest, Neo. The answers are coming.

352
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:28,704
Morpheus, what's happened to me?

353
00:37:28,879 --> 00:37:32,736
- What is this place?
- More important than "what" is "when."

354
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:36,576
- "When"?
- You believe it's the year 1999...

355
00:37:36,787 --> 00:37:39,051
...when, in fact, it's closer to 2199.

356
00:37:40,157 --> 00:37:44,856
I can't tell you exactly what year it is
because we honestly don't know.

357
00:37:45,329 --> 00:37:48,184
There's nothing I can say
that will explain it for you.

358
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:51,196
Come with me. See for yourself.

359
00:37:51,669 --> 00:37:53,432
This is my ship.

360
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:56,626
The Nebuchadnezzar.
It's a hovercraft.

361
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:01,273
This is the main deck.

362
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:08,274
This is the core...

363
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:14,554
...where we broadcast our pirate signal
and hack into the Matrix.

364
00:38:17,928 --> 00:38:21,022
Most of my crew you already know.

365
00:38:26,103 --> 00:38:27,502
This is Apoc...

366
00:38:28,272 --> 00:38:29,637
...Switch...

367
00:38:31,208 --> 00:38:32,436
...and Cypher.
- Hi.

368
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:36,307
The ones you don't know,
Tank and his big brother, Dozer.

369
00:38:37,181 --> 00:38:39,604
The little one behind you is Mouse.

370
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:47,253
You wanted to know
what the Matrix is, Neo?

371
00:38:48,259 --> 00:38:49,487
Trinity.

372
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:12,106
Try to relax.

373
00:39:16,954 --> 00:39:18,819
This will feel a little weird.

374
00:39:30,801 --> 00:39:32,166
This...

375
00:39:32,336 --> 00:39:34,031
...is the Construct.

376
00:39:34,472 --> 00:39:36,565
It's our loading program.

377
00:39:36,774 --> 00:39:39,334
We can load anything, from clothing...

378
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:40,874
...to equipment...

379
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:42,543
...weapons...

380
00:39:43,147 --> 00:39:44,944
...training simulations...

381
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:47,908
...anything we need.

382
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:53,144
Right now we're inside
a computer program?

383
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:55,347
Is it really so hard to believe?

384
00:39:55,826 --> 00:39:59,182
Your clothes are different.
The plugs in your body are gone.

385
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:01,723
Your hair has changed.

386
00:40:02,166 --> 00:40:05,465
Your appearance now is what we call
"residual self-image."

387
00:40:06,203 --> 00:40:08,797
It is the mental projection
of your digital self.

388
00:40:14,712 --> 00:40:17,567
- This isn't real?
- What is "real"?

389
00:40:18,015 --> 00:40:20,245
How do you define "real"?

390
00:40:20,451 --> 00:40:25,150
If you're talking about what you can feel,
what you can smell, taste and see...

391
00:40:25,356 --> 00:40:29,213
...then "real" is simply electrical
signals interpreted by your brain.

392
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:35,854
This is the world that you know.

393
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:40,260
The world as it was at the end
of the 20th century.

394
00:40:42,673 --> 00:40:47,064
It exists now only as part of
a neural-interactive simulation...

395
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:49,041
...that we call the Matrix.

396
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:55,848
You've been living
in a dream world, Neo.

397
00:40:56,821 --> 00:41:00,018
This is the world as it exists today.

398
00:41:13,103 --> 00:41:16,061
Welcome to the desert...

399
00:41:16,874 --> 00:41:18,501
...of the real.

400
00:41:21,879 --> 00:41:24,268
We have only bits and pieces
of information.

401
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:28,304
But what we know for certain is that
in the early 21 st century...

402
00:41:28,519 --> 00:41:31,818
...all of mankind was united
in celebration.

403
00:41:32,022 --> 00:41:36,812
We marveled at our own magnificence
as we gave birth to Al.

404
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:38,723
Al.

405
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:41,157
You mean artificial intelligence.

406
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:45,826
A singular consciousness that spawned
an entire race of machines.

407
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:50,094
We don't know who struck first,
us or them.

408
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:53,773
But we know that it was us
that scorched the sky.

409
00:41:55,446 --> 00:41:57,573
They were dependent on solar power...

410
00:41:57,781 --> 00:42:01,171
...and it was believed that
they would be unable to survive...

411
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:05,011
...without an energy source
as abundant as the sun.

412
00:42:05,222 --> 00:42:10,148
Throughout human history, we have been
dependent on machines to survive.

413
00:42:11,629 --> 00:42:15,827
Fate, it seems, is not
without a sense of irony.

414
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:23,427
The human body generates more
bioelectricity than a 120-volt battery.

415
00:42:23,641 --> 00:42:27,771
And over 25,000 BTUs of body heat.

416
00:42:29,713 --> 00:42:31,874
Combined with a form of fusion...

417
00:42:32,249 --> 00:42:37,039
...the machines had found all the energy
they would ever need.

418
00:42:41,158 --> 00:42:44,889
There are fields, Neo, endless fields...

419
00:42:45,162 --> 00:42:48,393
...where human beings
are no longer born.

420
00:42:49,099 --> 00:42:50,930
We are grown.

421
00:42:56,941 --> 00:42:59,603
For the longest time,
I wouldn't believe it.

422
00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:02,506
And then I saw the fields
with my own eyes...

423
00:43:03,714 --> 00:43:05,579
...watched them liquefy the dead...

424
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:09,048
...so they could be fed intravenously
to the living.

425
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:13,819
And standing there,
facing the pure, horrifying precision...

426
00:43:14,024 --> 00:43:16,982
...I came to realize
the obviousness of the truth.

427
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:21,427
What is the Matrix?

428
00:43:22,466 --> 00:43:23,694
Control.

429
00:43:25,035 --> 00:43:28,391
The Matrix is a computer-generated
dream world...

430
00:43:29,173 --> 00:43:32,267
...built to keep us under control...

431
00:43:33,477 --> 00:43:36,605
...in order to change a human being...

432
00:43:37,247 --> 00:43:38,475
...into this.

433
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:40,978
No.

434
00:43:42,586 --> 00:43:44,144
I don't believe it.

435
00:43:44,521 --> 00:43:45,749
It's not possible.

436
00:43:46,323 --> 00:43:49,121
I didn't say it would be easy, Neo.

437
00:43:49,727 --> 00:43:52,525
- I just said it would be the truth.
- Stop!

438
00:43:52,930 --> 00:43:54,158
Let me out!

439
00:43:54,932 --> 00:43:56,820
Let me out! I want out!

440
00:43:58,802 --> 00:44:01,464
- Easy, Neo. Easy.
- Get this thing out of me.

441
00:44:01,672 --> 00:44:03,367
Get this thing out of me!

442
00:44:05,175 --> 00:44:08,531
Don't touch me! Get away from me!
Stay away from me!

443
00:44:08,979 --> 00:44:10,469
I don't believe it.

444
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:12,445
I don't believe it.

445
00:44:12,716 --> 00:44:15,549
- I don't believe it.
- He's gonna pop.

446
00:44:15,719 --> 00:44:17,880
Breathe, Neo. Just breathe.

447
00:44:36,306 --> 00:44:38,035
I can't go back, can I?

448
00:44:38,909 --> 00:44:40,137
No.

449
00:44:41,145 --> 00:44:42,373
But if you could...

450
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:44,670
...would you really want to?

451
00:44:47,184 --> 00:44:50,517
I feel I owe you an apology.
We have a rule:

452
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:54,411
We never free a mind
once it's reached a certain age.

453
00:44:54,625 --> 00:44:56,115
It's dangerous.

454
00:44:56,293 --> 00:44:58,022
The mind has trouble letting go.

455
00:44:58,195 --> 00:45:00,493
I've seen it before, and I'm sorry.

456
00:45:01,498 --> 00:45:03,591
I did what I did because...

457
00:45:04,334 --> 00:45:05,824
...I had to.

458
00:45:14,211 --> 00:45:18,307
When the Matrix was first built,
there was a man born inside...

459
00:45:18,749 --> 00:45:22,571
...who had the ability
to change whatever he wanted...

460
00:45:22,986 --> 00:45:25,875
...to remake the Matrix as he saw fit.

461
00:45:27,624 --> 00:45:31,082
It was he who freed the first of us...

462
00:45:31,995 --> 00:45:33,587
...taught us the truth.

463
00:45:35,065 --> 00:45:38,125
As long as the Matrix exists...

464
00:45:38,435 --> 00:45:40,528
...the human race will never be free.

465
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:46,300
After he died...

466
00:45:47,077 --> 00:45:49,773
...the Oracle prophesied his return...

467
00:45:50,147 --> 00:45:53,605
...and that his coming would hail
the destruction of the Matrix...

468
00:45:53,784 --> 00:45:55,547
...end the war...

469
00:45:55,719 --> 00:45:58,051
...bring freedom to our people.

470
00:45:58,355 --> 00:46:03,145
That is why there are those of us who have
spent our entire lives searching the Matrix...

471
00:46:03,327 --> 00:46:04,885
...looking for him.

472
00:46:07,331 --> 00:46:09,424
I did what I did because...

473
00:46:11,068 --> 00:46:13,161
...I believe that search is over.
