1
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,071
Back! Get back!

2
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:44,094
Spray!

3
00:00:55,038 --> 00:00:56,010
Get off!

4
00:00:56,077 --> 00:00:57,069
Hurry!

5
00:00:57,078 --> 00:00:58,064
Run!

6
00:01:06,068 --> 00:01:08,025
Okay. Pull him up!

7
00:01:09,079 --> 00:01:11,028
Pull him up!

8
00:01:12,054 --> 00:01:14,091
Come on.

9
00:01:48,049 --> 00:01:50,054
Get this to the lab. And hurry!

10
00:03:47,073 --> 00:03:48,045
Move!

11
00:03:50,072 --> 00:03:51,078
Let's go.

12
00:04:02,097 --> 00:04:04,052
509, unpack, and help him.

13
00:04:04,061 --> 00:04:06,083
502, the computer,
and you check with the team.

14
00:04:07,009 --> 00:04:07,095
Yes, sir.

15
00:04:25,012 --> 00:04:26,020
Get ready.

16
00:04:52,014 --> 00:04:53,035
Target is approaching!

17
00:05:32,002 --> 00:05:33,069
Here. Get down there!

18
00:05:37,078 --> 00:05:39,016
What's this stuff?

19
00:05:39,026 --> 00:05:40,064
Can't move!

20
00:05:56,006 --> 00:05:58,067
Come on, move it!

21
00:06:02,034 --> 00:06:03,045
Let's go.

22
00:06:03,054 --> 00:06:04,071
Keep moving!

23
00:06:06,007 --> 00:06:07,021
Come on.

24
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:08,051
Ok. You get up here.

25
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:17,057
Attention!

26
00:06:18,027 --> 00:06:19,027
What's your name?

27
00:06:19,036 --> 00:06:20,059
Don't know, sir!

28
00:06:21,065 --> 00:06:22,042
Where are you from?

29
00:06:22,051 --> 00:06:23,051
Don't know, sir!

30
00:06:24,064 --> 00:06:27,025
Good. No names, no background.

31
00:06:27,033 --> 00:06:28,097
But highly disciplined.

32
00:06:29,006 --> 00:06:31,047
Mission is over, go have some fun.

33
00:06:31,078 --> 00:06:33,016
Thank you, sir.

34
00:06:36,039 --> 00:06:40,009
Ok. Dispose your weapons,
dispose your equipment.

35
00:06:40,055 --> 00:06:43,010
523.Yes.

36
00:06:43,011 --> 00:06:45,082
Go! Collect. Go!
To the main helicopter. Go!

37
00:06:47,029 --> 00:06:48,087
Go! Move it, go!

38
00:06:49,052 --> 00:06:50,048
Ok. Dismiss.

39
00:07:00,032 --> 00:07:01,051
Sorry, sir.

40
00:07:21,051 --> 00:07:22,080
So sorry, I’ve to do this.

41
00:07:25,034 --> 00:07:26,041
Don't move.

42
00:07:32,005 --> 00:07:33,097
Sorry soldiers,
we've got only two parachutes.

43
00:07:35,067 --> 00:07:36,063
What the hell is going on?

44
00:07:36,084 --> 00:07:38,028
Have a nice flight, bye.

45
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:48,035
Let me go.

46
00:07:52,018 --> 00:07:55,017
What are you up to do?
Say it.

47
00:08:00,081 --> 00:08:02,073
Here's the control. Come on.

48
00:08:02,108 --> 00:08:08,048
Come on. Come on.

49
00:09:05,075 --> 00:09:08,017
Jacky Chan,
one of our best agents in Hong Kong.

50
00:09:08,028 --> 00:09:10,054
Is also missing in the African action.

51
00:09:10,065 --> 00:09:13,045
The three men they hijacked
are the scientists responsible.

52
00:09:13,055 --> 00:09:17,089
For the comet research project recently
launched by the African state.

53
00:09:18,023 --> 00:09:19,037
Lights!

54
00:09:20,001 --> 00:09:22,044
We have a serious situation on our hands.

55
00:09:22,051 --> 00:09:25,045
The operation was carried out
with clinical precision.

56
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:28,077
Using united states air force helicopters.

57
00:09:28,094 --> 00:09:33,035
They seized the meteorite fragments
along with the three scientists.

58
00:09:33,045 --> 00:09:35,093
And until now their
whereabouts are unknown.

59
00:09:36,004 --> 00:09:37,056
If they knew the transport schedule.

60
00:09:37,067 --> 00:09:39,056
Someone must have leaked the information.

61
00:09:40,004 --> 00:09:42,082
How many C.I.A.
Staff knew about this project?

62
00:09:43,005 --> 00:09:44,029
I know where you're heading
with this, Norman.

63
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:45,080
And I don't like it.

64
00:09:45,089 --> 00:09:48,028
How can you be so sure it
wasn't one of your own people?

65
00:09:48,039 --> 00:09:50,024
Why the hell would my guys
break into a hangar.

66
00:09:50,034 --> 00:09:52,092
They already have access to and
steal their own aircraft?

67
00:09:53,003 --> 00:09:56,054
Because it's a perfect cover
and no one would suspect them.

68
00:09:56,061 --> 00:09:57,085
And remember, general.

69
00:09:58,046 --> 00:10:01,015
The C.I.A. Pulled out of
south Africa over a year ago.

70
00:10:01,024 --> 00:10:03,015
Only the essential staff remain.

71
00:10:03,027 --> 00:10:05,027
Right now, our first concern.

72
00:10:05,037 --> 00:10:08,018
Should be the retrieval of
the scientists and the fragments.

73
00:10:08,037 --> 00:10:11,083
Agreed. There could be serious
military ramifications.

74
00:10:12,034 --> 00:10:14,080
If the wrong people get a
hold of this formula.

75
00:10:14,087 --> 00:10:17,081
We've got to find out who's
behind this pulling the strings.

76
00:10:18,023 --> 00:10:19,073
Agent Morgan.

77
00:10:20,002 --> 00:10:20,075
Yes, sir.

78
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:23,024
You used to head up our
south African operation.

79
00:10:23,035 --> 00:10:25,010
You know the terrain,
you know the locals.

80
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:27,063
Take 3 agents and hop
the next flight over there.

81
00:10:27,073 --> 00:10:30,039
I want to see positive results.
And fast.

82
00:10:30,048 --> 00:10:31,076
Consider it done, sir.

83
00:10:31,086 --> 00:10:32,048
Thank you, terry.

84
00:10:32,059 --> 00:10:33,039
Bye.

85
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:34,012
General Sharman.

86
00:10:34,035 --> 00:10:34,099
Hello, Norman.

87
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:36,046
I hear you're retiring a few days.

88
00:10:36,056 --> 00:10:37,045
Yes, I am.

89
00:10:37,055 --> 00:10:40,004
Congratulations on your retirement,
general Sharman.

90
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:41,038
Thank you.

91
00:10:41,061 --> 00:10:44,027
I bet you're going to miss being
in the middle of all the action.

92
00:10:44,052 --> 00:10:47,059
Norman, I'm going to take that
fat pension check of mine.

93
00:10:47,069 --> 00:10:49,092
And head for my favourite fishing hole.

94
00:10:50,022 --> 00:10:52,032
I want a black op assigned to this case.

95
00:10:52,055 --> 00:10:54,052
Are you saying
we can't trust our own people?

96
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,026
Better safe than sorry.

97
00:10:57,013 --> 00:10:58,030
Shall I select them
from Washington or.

98
00:10:58,041 --> 00:11:00,041
From one of the outside branches?

99
00:11:01,013 --> 00:11:02,024
Outside.

100
00:11:02,034 --> 00:11:04,028
Sir, Mr. White is here.

101
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:05,050
Thank you. Send him in.

102
00:11:05,061 --> 00:11:07,000
And tell them to
report to me directly.

103
00:11:07,011 --> 00:11:08,025
Yes, sir.

104
00:11:08,058 --> 00:11:11,029
Your plan worked,
mission completed.

105
00:12:03,016 --> 00:12:05,004
What's wrong with him?

106
00:12:05,056 --> 00:12:06,097
How is he?

107
00:12:07,068 --> 00:12:09,050
He's just woken up.

108
00:12:10,007 --> 00:12:12,017
My friend!
You gave us quite a scare.

109
00:12:12,028 --> 00:12:18,095
We're happy you've woken up.
Welcome to our land.

110
00:12:36,052 --> 00:12:39,052
Where am I?
How did I get here?

111
00:12:39,063 --> 00:12:43,088
These men found you in the mountains.

112
00:12:44,042 --> 00:12:46,088
Now, I want to know,
where do you come from.

113
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:48,093
And how did you get here?

114
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:51,006
I don't know your language.

115
00:12:51,065 --> 00:12:53,018
Does anybody speak English?

116
00:12:53,029 --> 00:12:59,036
I am the chief. Me. The chief.

117
00:13:01,057 --> 00:13:04,035
And who are you?
What is your name?

118
00:13:08,061 --> 00:13:10,058
Who am I?

119
00:13:12,077 --> 00:13:14,014
Who am I?

120
00:13:14,024 --> 00:13:17,033
His name is who am I

121
00:13:18,014 --> 00:13:21,000
Who am I?

122
00:13:21,021 --> 00:13:27,098
Your name is who am I?

123
00:13:28,047 --> 00:13:31,009
Who am I?

124
00:13:50,044 --> 00:13:51,069
Who am I

125
00:13:53,045 --> 00:13:54,073
Who is he?

126
00:14:05,009 --> 00:14:06,072
Hello.

127
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:08,061
Hey! Looks like you're
getting better, my man.

128
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:10,017
I knew he would.

129
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:41,042
What are you doing
on this search, sir?

130
00:14:42,003 --> 00:14:44,045
Langley must be serious
about finding these guys.

131
00:14:44,056 --> 00:14:47,024
They're traitors.
They've stolen a discovery.

132
00:14:47,034 --> 00:14:50,012
Which could keep our nation on top.

133
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:52,080
In the 21st century.

134
00:14:53,067 --> 00:14:54,084
Yes, sir.

135
00:14:57,082 --> 00:14:59,005
Baba.

136
00:15:03,057 --> 00:15:07,058
Who am I, we have seen a
miracle over the mountain.

137
00:15:07,088 --> 00:15:12,066
There was iron that had been burnt.

138
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:17,031
We buried 8 bodies wearing
same clothes like yours.

139
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:20,031
You mean come with you? Go?

140
00:15:20,042 --> 00:15:22,027
Yes. Let's go!

141
00:15:22,037 --> 00:15:23,075
Go!

142
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:35,096
Look at that!

143
00:16:28,089 --> 00:16:31,094
Yvirorich, Russian.

144
00:16:32,005 --> 00:16:33,032
Jakol, Israel.

145
00:16:33,042 --> 00:16:34,028
Hans, German.

146
00:16:34,038 --> 00:16:35,012
Thailand.

147
00:16:35,021 --> 00:16:36,042
Tachi, Japan.

148
00:16:36,062 --> 00:16:37,048
Korea.

149
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:33,011
Who am I, come quickly! Come!

150
00:17:33,021 --> 00:17:35,015
I'm sorry. I don't know.
What are you saying?

151
00:17:51,005 --> 00:17:53,026
See! There it is.
The fire I told you about.

152
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:59,043
A light!

153
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:29,042
I can go! I can go!
Yes! I can go!

154
00:19:01,043 --> 00:19:02,051
When we found you.

155
00:19:02,061 --> 00:19:05,039
You were wearing the same clothes.
Am I right?

156
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:07,060
Yes. We wear the same clothes.

157
00:19:16,072 --> 00:19:18,034
Eleven done one too many.

158
00:19:21,071 --> 00:19:25,067
Baba. Never play with
dead people's belongings.

159
00:19:28,091 --> 00:19:31,021
I know this is bad luck
for your culture.

160
00:19:32,036 --> 00:19:35,049
I'll go on alone.
Thank you.

161
00:19:35,059 --> 00:19:37,041
Go well!

162
00:19:40,039 --> 00:19:41,048
Baba.

163
00:19:41,093 --> 00:19:43,058
Can I borrow your compass?

164
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:46,046
Can I take it?

165
00:19:46,088 --> 00:19:49,047
I bring back, I promise.

166
00:19:50,054 --> 00:19:51,091
I promise.

167
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,063
Please come back soon.

168
00:19:53,073 --> 00:19:56,000
I will miss you.

169
00:20:00,028 --> 00:20:01,002
Thank you.

170
00:20:01,012 --> 00:20:01,098
Be careful.

171
00:20:02,008 --> 00:20:04,005
Take care, my friend.

172
00:20:04,016 --> 00:20:05,062
You will succeed!

173
00:20:29,021 --> 00:20:35,015
Somebody! Help us!

174
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,005
Are you okay?

175
00:20:47,033 --> 00:20:49,082
We're over here! Help!

176
00:20:50,002 --> 00:20:54,075
Look! Somebody! Help us!

177
00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:09,072
Oh, my god!

178
00:21:28,082 --> 00:21:30,022
Get away from him!

179
00:21:31,006 --> 00:21:33,044
Stop eating my brother,
you animal!

180
00:21:34,016 --> 00:21:35,030
Leave us alone!

181
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:37,078
Leave us alone!

182
00:21:41,097 --> 00:21:43,005
Don't move!

183
00:21:45,001 --> 00:21:46,041
Don't move! You know this?

184
00:21:46,061 --> 00:21:47,085
This is a gun!

185
00:21:48,055 --> 00:21:51,021
You know, I can bang you!

186
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:52,080
You know, I can shoot you!

187
00:21:53,023 --> 00:21:55,040
I can bang you, you know?

188
00:21:58,047 --> 00:22:01,019
I know karate! Karate!

189
00:22:18,072 --> 00:22:19,065
Medicine!

190
00:22:27,071 --> 00:22:33,082
It's medicine!

191
00:22:34,033 --> 00:22:35,064
My brother!

192
00:22:37,008 --> 00:22:38,090
Your brother?

193
00:22:53,046 --> 00:22:56,024
You're helping my brother!

194
00:22:58,061 --> 00:23:00,013
You understand English?

195
00:23:01,027 --> 00:23:02,082
Say something.

196
00:23:04,046 --> 00:23:10,072
Those medicine make my mouth numb.

197
00:23:10,082 --> 00:23:12,036
You speak French?

198
00:23:12,046 --> 00:23:14,060
I understand a little, do you?

199
00:23:20,077 --> 00:23:22,084
Oh, I'm sorry,
I don't understand your language.

200
00:23:22,095 --> 00:23:27,021
But, is my brother okay?
Is he all right?

201
00:25:55,001 --> 00:25:56,050
Amazing!

202
00:26:02,011 --> 00:26:05,091
You navigate, and work the G.P.S., ok?

203
00:26:15,026 --> 00:26:18,061
You want to drive?
But do you know how to drive?

204
00:26:21,085 --> 00:26:23,035
I think I better, you know

205
00:26:29,011 --> 00:26:32,059
Nine o'clock. Turn this way!

206
00:27:33,028 --> 00:27:34,094
Okay. Just go straight ahead.

207
00:27:35,033 --> 00:27:37,018
Aiji, how are you feeling?

208
00:27:37,044 --> 00:27:40,008
Feeling better. I.V. Is helping.

209
00:27:40,019 --> 00:27:41,012
Good!

210
00:28:07,078 --> 00:28:10,020
Please help us! We need a doctor!

211
00:28:18,008 --> 00:28:21,033
Look! Here's the driver!
Back a little bit! Back!

212
00:28:24,003 --> 00:28:25,024
He's very lucky.

213
00:28:25,047 --> 00:28:28,028
The natural herbs on his
leg neutralized the poison.

214
00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:34,013
And that coconut I.V... The only people
that use it are elite military units.

215
00:28:34,036 --> 00:28:35,054
Who applied it?

216
00:28:35,064 --> 00:28:36,079
Here.

217
00:28:37,091 --> 00:28:39,040
That's him over there.

218
00:28:39,051 --> 00:28:42,003
Amazing. Very talented native!

219
00:28:42,014 --> 00:28:43,099
Say again? What?
Give us a story!

220
00:28:44,008 --> 00:28:45,033
Where are you going?

221
00:28:48,008 --> 00:28:48,097
What?

222
00:28:52,031 --> 00:28:53,016
What's he on about?

223
00:28:53,052 --> 00:28:55,090
Oh, it's okay. Speak to him.
He understands English.

224
00:29:16,079 --> 00:29:18,045
One of them is still alive.

225
00:29:18,068 --> 00:29:19,054
What?

226
00:29:19,064 --> 00:29:21,036
He's all over the local paper.

227
00:29:21,091 --> 00:29:23,089
I want to know if any of
the others survived.

228
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:26,025
I want every one of them liquidated.

229
00:29:27,041 --> 00:29:28,066
Including this one.

230
00:29:30,033 --> 00:29:34,009
That's a bit difficult with these,
C.I.A. Boys scout on my tail.

231
00:29:34,064 --> 00:29:38,070
That's not your problem, Morgan.
We've other people to take care of that.

232
00:29:38,093 --> 00:29:40,052
You just find him.

233
00:29:58,044 --> 00:29:59,058
Who am I?

234
00:30:00,027 --> 00:30:01,035
Yes.

235
00:30:01,055 --> 00:30:02,035
I'm Christine spaak.

236
00:30:02,044 --> 00:30:04,023
I work for the south African tribune.

237
00:30:04,055 --> 00:30:07,087
I saw you on TV...
What a great story! That was!

238
00:30:07,097 --> 00:30:10,015
I want to do an in depth article on you.

239
00:30:10,067 --> 00:30:11,049
Huh?

240
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:13,049
I want to do an article on you.

241
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:16,057
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm very busy right now.
Maybe some other day.

242
00:30:16,068 --> 00:30:19,009
But you don't understand!
You're a hero!

243
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:21,057
Everybody wants to know who you are!

244
00:30:22,028 --> 00:30:23,042
They do?

245
00:30:24,013 --> 00:30:25,031
So do I

246
00:30:26,033 --> 00:30:27,064
Who am I

247
00:30:28,003 --> 00:30:29,014
Excuse me.

248
00:30:29,034 --> 00:30:32,000
Wait! The article. Wait!

249
00:30:33,043 --> 00:30:34,071
Wait, wait!

250
00:30:34,097 --> 00:30:36,021
Hi, who am I

251
00:30:36,092 --> 00:30:37,072
Don't you want to be a hero?

252
00:30:37,082 --> 00:30:40,060
Everybody wants to know
what happened in the rally.

253
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:42,004
Christine. Reporter.

254
00:30:42,026 --> 00:30:43,015
How's your brother?

255
00:30:43,026 --> 00:30:45,052
Oh, he's going to be fine.
And the doctor's ready to see you.

256
00:30:46,055 --> 00:30:48,092
I think she wants to interview you.

257
00:30:50,007 --> 00:30:52,001
Oh? So you're the journalist? Yeah?

258
00:30:52,012 --> 00:30:54,060
You know my name? My name is yuki.
It's Y ­ U ­ K ­ I

259
00:30:54,097 --> 00:30:59,054
Our x­rays show that you experienced
a severe blow in this area.

260
00:31:00,008 --> 00:31:02,012
It's very sensitive.

261
00:31:02,036 --> 00:31:05,039
It controls your reason,
logic and memory.

262
00:31:05,049 --> 00:31:07,004
That's why you're feeling confused.

263
00:31:07,027 --> 00:31:08,056
I'm not mixed up!

264
00:31:09,016 --> 00:31:11,018
But if I am,
is there any cure?

265
00:31:11,027 --> 00:31:14,068
That's what they all want.
There is no immediate cure.

266
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,023
Why don't you contact the police?

267
00:31:16,033 --> 00:31:19,007
Perhaps missing persons will have some
information that will jog your memory.

268
00:31:19,014 --> 00:31:20,076
So where are you going now?

269
00:31:20,087 --> 00:31:22,008
I'm going to the police station.

270
00:31:22,018 --> 00:31:23,012
The police station?

271
00:31:26,008 --> 00:31:27,019
Yes.

272
00:31:30,002 --> 00:31:31,043
I'll see you later then.

273
00:31:31,053 --> 00:31:32,087
Yeah. Bye.

274
00:31:48,096 --> 00:31:52,012
Did it work?
Do you remember anything?

275
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:58,009
What do you think you're doing?
This is a hospital!

276
00:31:58,074 --> 00:32:01,026
I was just helping my patient.
I'm sorry.

277
00:32:02,088 --> 00:32:04,015
Excuse me, sir.

278
00:32:05,001 --> 00:32:06,060
Agent lee, C.I.A

279
00:32:06,071 --> 00:32:07,041
C.I.A?

280
00:32:07,051 --> 00:32:09,041
Our superior would like to speak with you,
just a moment.

281
00:32:11,064 --> 00:32:15,085
Nothing serious. Just a quick chat.
Would you mind coming with us?

282
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:18,050
Thank you.

283
00:32:20,052 --> 00:32:22,054
Feel free to use this room.
It's all yours.

284
00:32:36,036 --> 00:32:37,067
Are you looking for me?

285
00:32:37,077 --> 00:32:39,011
Yes, I am.

286
00:32:39,021 --> 00:32:41,096
Who are you?
Have we meet before?

287
00:32:42,005 --> 00:32:43,036
Not that I recall.

288
00:32:43,075 --> 00:32:45,048
Morgan, C.I.A

289
00:32:47,001 --> 00:32:50,020
Chief operative, southern Africa.
Pleased to meet you.

290
00:32:53,035 --> 00:32:56,061
Have I done something wrong?
Do you know about my past?

291
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:58,023
Yes, I do.

292
00:32:59,019 --> 00:33:02,065
I know you came out of the desert.
I know you lost your memory.

293
00:33:02,094 --> 00:33:03,064
And I believe you can help us.

294
00:33:03,074 --> 00:33:05,091
With a highly classified investigation.

295
00:33:05,126 --> 00:33:07,019
Me?

296
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:09,085
Are you sure you saw eight graves?

297
00:33:09,095 --> 00:33:11,035
Yes, I'm sure.

298
00:33:11,068 --> 00:33:14,061
And a skeleton hanging from a tree?

299
00:33:15,032 --> 00:33:17,011
Yes. From a parachute.

300
00:33:17,021 --> 00:33:20,098
Good. This information could be
highly valuable to us.

301
00:33:21,018 --> 00:33:23,031
Of course we'll have to verify it.

302
00:33:23,096 --> 00:33:26,051
And remember, this is top secret.

303
00:33:26,061 --> 00:33:29,084
Not a word to anyone.
I mean, no one.

304
00:33:30,061 --> 00:33:32,033
Yes, of course.

305
00:33:32,091 --> 00:33:36,011
Mr. Morgan, if you find out
anything else about me.

306
00:33:36,033 --> 00:33:37,087
Please let me know

307
00:33:37,097 --> 00:33:40,004
Sure. I'll be in touch.

308
00:33:40,015 --> 00:33:41,052
Thank you.

309
00:33:41,061 --> 00:33:43,023
Very soon.

310
00:33:52,065 --> 00:33:54,031
Mean anything to you?

311
00:33:55,066 --> 00:33:56,084
What?

312
00:33:57,038 --> 00:33:59,091
Good. Keep well.

313
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:12,010
Close, but no cigar.

314
00:34:12,019 --> 00:34:12,095
It's not him?

315
00:34:13,006 --> 00:34:15,020
No. Striking resemblance though.

316
00:34:15,029 --> 00:34:17,078
Mr. Morgan, wait.

317
00:34:18,001 --> 00:34:20,029
If I remember anything,
how can I contact you?

318
00:34:20,038 --> 00:34:21,081
You have a business card?

319
00:34:22,005 --> 00:34:23,057
I'm sorry. I don't.

320
00:34:23,068 --> 00:34:24,070
Here. You can use mine.

321
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:25,087
No!

322
00:34:26,053 --> 00:34:29,039
Use this. It's better.

323
00:34:29,072 --> 00:34:32,006
The C.I.A. Will put
you through immediately.

324
00:34:32,015 --> 00:34:34,020
It's a phone card.
You can use it anywhere in the world.

325
00:34:34,048 --> 00:34:35,095
Thank you.

326
00:34:40,018 --> 00:34:41,087
The poor guy can't remember a thing.

327
00:34:41,097 --> 00:34:43,015
So put him out of his misery.

328
00:34:43,035 --> 00:34:46,079
I'll make sure he doesn't enjoy
the African sun. Leave it to me.

329
00:34:55,072 --> 00:34:56,016
Get to work, and running!

330
00:34:56,017 --> 00:34:59,016
We're at a very delicate stage of testing.

331
00:34:59,026 --> 00:35:00,083
The process should be gradual.

332
00:35:01,006 --> 00:35:01,069
I can't guarantee.

333
00:35:01,079 --> 00:35:04,006
And I can't guarantee
your family's safety.

334
00:35:04,016 --> 00:35:05,069
Now get it started!

335
00:35:05,079 --> 00:35:06,077
Work!

336
00:35:08,026 --> 00:35:09,063
Activate the accelerator!

337
00:35:11,001 --> 00:35:11,087
All set!

338
00:35:18,004 --> 00:35:20,028
How can a tiny fragment
power up a whole city?

339
00:35:20,047 --> 00:35:23,077
You don't understand the
power of this fragment!

340
00:35:23,096 --> 00:35:25,065
You! Keep working!

341
00:35:25,075 --> 00:35:27,053
Initiating bombardment!

342
00:35:27,064 --> 00:35:28,066
Watch the levee!

343
00:35:49,023 --> 00:35:50,044
What's the flow rate?

344
00:35:50,054 --> 00:35:52,075
Forty thousand joules and climbing!

345
00:35:53,055 --> 00:35:55,033
It's working! It's working!

346
00:35:55,043 --> 00:35:56,045
Yeah!

347
00:35:56,055 --> 00:35:57,044
Yes!

348
00:36:08,007 --> 00:36:09,005
Look out!

349
00:36:09,016 --> 00:36:10,027
Go! Check it out!

350
00:36:10,038 --> 00:36:11,035
What's going on?

351
00:36:12,006 --> 00:36:15,017
The voltage is too high!

352
00:36:17,054 --> 00:36:18,065
Abort! Abort!

353
00:36:19,007 --> 00:36:21,041
Don't abort! Keep going!

354
00:36:21,051 --> 00:36:22,096
We told you it was too soon!

355
00:36:23,007 --> 00:36:24,034
The core's expanding!

356
00:36:25,002 --> 00:36:26,016
Come on!

357
00:36:28,002 --> 00:36:29,024
Move it!

358
00:36:37,075 --> 00:36:39,013
Quick!

359
00:36:53,064 --> 00:36:54,088
Let's go.

360
00:36:59,065 --> 00:37:01,024
Oh, my god!

361
00:37:21,002 --> 00:37:22,036
Move it!

362
00:37:26,024 --> 00:37:27,013
What was that?

363
00:37:27,036 --> 00:37:29,002
I don't know. Let's take a look.

364
00:37:44,006 --> 00:37:46,081
Officer! Officer!

365
00:37:46,091 --> 00:37:48,009
Officer!

366
00:37:48,019 --> 00:37:49,053
Sergeant actually!

367
00:37:49,073 --> 00:37:51,066
Sergeant. What about my case?

368
00:37:51,077 --> 00:37:52,085
I've been waiting two hours.

369
00:37:53,005 --> 00:37:55,029
I'll get to you when I can.
Everybody is waiting!

370
00:37:55,048 --> 00:37:58,052
The power station has just blown up,
and it's chaos everywhere!

371
00:37:58,062 --> 00:38:00,021
What are you doing
standing in front of me?

372
00:38:00,031 --> 00:38:02,065
If you're a missing person,
what are you doing here?

373
00:38:02,075 --> 00:38:03,061
Have you seen a doctor yet?

374
00:38:03,071 --> 00:38:05,016
I've already seen the doctor, officer.

375
00:38:05,027 --> 00:38:06,068
Sergeant!

376
00:38:07,084 --> 00:38:08,080
Look, have a seat.

377
00:38:08,089 --> 00:38:10,099
As soon as we have sorted out
the problem with computers.

378
00:38:11,010 --> 00:38:12,030
You'll be first on my list.

379
00:38:12,041 --> 00:38:13,033
Okay?

380
00:38:13,053 --> 00:38:14,026
Pullen.

381
00:38:14,036 --> 00:38:15,057
What?

382
00:38:16,024 --> 00:38:17,071
Yes, sir.

383
00:38:24,095 --> 00:38:26,022
More coffee?

384
00:38:26,077 --> 00:38:28,046
No, thank you. Five is enough.

385
00:38:28,056 --> 00:38:29,096
I insist.

386
00:38:31,031 --> 00:38:32,081
Thank you.

387
00:38:33,052 --> 00:38:35,004
What am I waiting for?

388
00:38:36,037 --> 00:38:37,074
Computers.

389
00:38:52,049 --> 00:38:55,086
Thanks for popping in.
I've been dying to meet you.

390
00:39:05,047 --> 00:39:06,065
What's going on?

391
00:39:06,085 --> 00:39:07,083
Internal security!

392
00:39:07,093 --> 00:39:10,039
I've got a couple of questions,
I want to ask you.

393
00:39:35,009 --> 00:39:36,030
Go!

394
00:39:45,088 --> 00:39:47,095
You two stay.
The rest of you come with me.

395
00:39:49,068 --> 00:39:51,040
We have the suspect. Keep guard.

396
00:39:53,001 --> 00:39:54,025
Get me the stuff.

397
00:40:02,085 --> 00:40:03,094
Have a seat.

398
00:40:08,093 --> 00:40:11,036
28th of march, you and your group.

399
00:40:11,046 --> 00:40:14,027
Spent the night in this
deserted exhibition hall.

400
00:40:16,032 --> 00:40:19,099
On the 29th,
your friends disappeared.

401
00:40:20,061 --> 00:40:25,050
On 30 march, 3 very important scientists
from my country were kidnapped.

402
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:31,012
And their whereabouts is still
a mystery where have you taken them?

403
00:40:32,089 --> 00:40:34,045
Now listen, my friend.

404
00:40:34,056 --> 00:40:35,074
We witnessed five guys.

405
00:40:35,083 --> 00:40:37,090
And the scientists at the power station.

406
00:40:38,001 --> 00:40:40,060
Then, mysteriously it blew up.

407
00:40:41,047 --> 00:40:42,045
Now if you're not a terrorist.

408
00:40:42,055 --> 00:40:44,014
Why the hell did you blow it up?

409
00:40:44,054 --> 00:40:46,067
Who are you working for?

410
00:40:51,006 --> 00:40:52,037
I don't know

411
00:40:55,054 --> 00:40:58,060
Now on the day that our
scientists were kidnapped.

412
00:40:58,070 --> 00:41:00,098
We discovered extremely high-Tech.

413
00:41:01,007 --> 00:41:02,048
Lethal weaponry.

414
00:41:02,067 --> 00:41:04,091
The likes of which we've never
been seen in Africa.

415
00:41:05,019 --> 00:41:07,030
Now only a first
world country has got the money.

416
00:41:07,041 --> 00:41:09,089
And the technology to make
something like that.

417
00:41:10,067 --> 00:41:15,001
So, I want to know from you,
my friend, who are you working for?

418
00:41:15,062 --> 00:41:19,040
The Japanese, the Chinese,
or the Americans?

419
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:23,066
Or maybe somebody else?

420
00:41:23,075 --> 00:41:27,058
And tell me, eleven done one too many.
What does it mean?

421
00:41:28,083 --> 00:41:29,095
I don't know who saved my life.

422
00:41:30,005 --> 00:41:31,042
But I thank you.

423
00:41:31,053 --> 00:41:33,041
Yvirorich, Russian.

424
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:34,075
Jakol, Israel.

425
00:41:35,039 --> 00:41:36,073
Hans, German.

426
00:41:37,018 --> 00:41:38,050
And you, what's your name?

427
00:41:38,059 --> 00:41:41,008
I'm Paul, France.

428
00:41:41,018 --> 00:41:42,087
Muhammad, I'm Malaysian.

429
00:41:42,097 --> 00:41:44,043
Yubicha, Thai.

430
00:41:44,055 --> 00:41:45,092
Tachi, Japan.

431
00:41:46,001 --> 00:41:47,054
Dick sing, Korea.

432
00:41:48,054 --> 00:41:49,011
My name is¡­

433
00:41:49,021 --> 00:41:52,041
Gentlemen, what a great combination
we've got here.

434
00:41:56,055 --> 00:41:57,096
Who are you?

435
00:41:58,005 --> 00:41:59,042
You want to know who I am?

436
00:42:00,023 --> 00:42:02,037
I want to know who I am.

437
00:42:03,087 --> 00:42:06,068
We found 54 different passports.

438
00:42:06,098 --> 00:42:10,024
That makes 6 for each of you. Why?

439
00:42:10,091 --> 00:42:14,087
Where are your friends?
Who are your friends?

440
00:42:17,049 --> 00:42:20,002
Well, there's no point trying
to cover for your friends.

441
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:25,064
And don't you think you're in deep trouble now,
you ain't smelt nothing yet?

442
00:42:27,042 --> 00:42:30,006
Talk to me. Now!

443
00:42:30,051 --> 00:42:31,085
They're all dead.

444
00:42:47,028 --> 00:42:49,010
Quite a tough guy!

445
00:42:50,006 --> 00:42:52,026
We know about your special training.

446
00:42:52,035 --> 00:42:55,030
But we've got special ways
to make tough guys like you crack.

447
00:42:57,016 --> 00:42:58,066
I'm waiting.

448
00:42:59,073 --> 00:43:02,049
I told you, it's no use.

449
00:43:02,077 --> 00:43:05,096
I lost all my memory.

450
00:43:06,036 --> 00:43:09,056
With this attitude,
you're going to lose more than just your memory.

451
00:43:09,099 --> 00:43:12,091
Get my drift? Book him.
On terrorism, espionage.

452
00:43:12,099 --> 00:43:14,073
...and attempted murder.

453
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,099
If any of his friends arrive,
I'd like to have a little chat with them.

454
00:43:19,027 --> 00:43:20,061
Let's go, smart ass!

455
00:43:37,074 --> 00:43:39,044
What's happening in here?

456
00:43:46,019 --> 00:43:48,091
You idiots! He was handcuffed! That way!

457
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:26,013
Go around the back!

458
00:45:03,081 --> 00:45:05,015
How did he do this?

459
00:45:06,076 --> 00:45:08,034
Don't just stand there.
we're losing him!

460
00:45:18,001 --> 00:45:19,066
Thank you, I'll be back.

461
00:45:21,068 --> 00:45:22,082
He's on his way in.

462
00:45:29,001 --> 00:45:30,020
Room 1954

463
00:45:30,028 --> 00:45:31,046
- Certainly, sir
- Thank you.

464
00:45:31,062 --> 00:45:34,070
Who Am I, Christine, South African Tribune.
Remember me?

465
00:45:34,077 --> 00:45:36,047
Here, take one of my cards.

466
00:45:37,010 --> 00:45:38,001
I finally found you!

467
00:45:38,009 --> 00:45:40,026
It's amazing how hard it
is to track you down.

468
00:45:40,033 --> 00:45:40,096
My editor's been asking.

469
00:45:41,005 --> 00:45:42,051
Excuse me. Could you do me a favor?

470
00:45:42,066 --> 00:45:45,031
My taxi's waiting outside.
Can you pay for it?

471
00:45:45,046 --> 00:45:46,097
Then the interview. Okay?

472
00:45:47,024 --> 00:45:50,008
OK, no problem. But remember the deal.

473
00:45:50,016 --> 00:45:54,011
The interview as soon as I get back.
I trust you.

474
00:45:56,053 --> 00:45:58,003
Check her out.

475
00:46:04,037 --> 00:46:05,072
Thank you.

476
00:46:06,039 --> 00:46:08,012
Police, step aside, please.

477
00:46:08,020 --> 00:46:10,029
Police?
I didn't even see your I.D!

478
00:47:33,036 --> 00:47:34,073
He's gone that way!

479
00:47:50,057 --> 00:47:51,055
What did you give him?

480
00:47:51,064 --> 00:47:53,025
My card. I told you I'm a reporter.

481
00:47:53,029 --> 00:47:54,078
I'm doing a story on him.

482
00:47:54,094 --> 00:47:56,024
Sure. Story. Right.

483
00:48:31,019 --> 00:48:32,017
Come in, come in.

484
00:48:34,092 --> 00:48:35,098
What's going on?

485
00:49:09,022 --> 00:49:09,096
What?

486
00:49:10,001 --> 00:49:11,022
Go! Go! Go!

487
00:49:12,099 --> 00:49:14,013
Stop!

488
00:49:16,013 --> 00:49:17,015
Start the car!

489
00:49:17,023 --> 00:49:18,029
How?

490
00:49:21,059 --> 00:49:23,012
I'll shift the gears!

491
00:49:23,021 --> 00:49:24,018
What?

492
00:49:24,026 --> 00:49:25,052
What's going on?

493
00:49:26,043 --> 00:49:27,040
Come in!

494
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,045
Wait! Are you crazy?

495
00:49:29,048 --> 00:49:31,013
Slow down, come on! I'm not in yet!

496
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:36,060
Come on, move it, get on!

497
00:49:41,028 --> 00:49:42,089
Third, fourth gear.

498
00:49:43,047 --> 00:49:44,050
Which gear you run?

499
00:49:44,057 --> 00:49:45,016
I don't know

500
00:49:45,024 --> 00:49:46,042
Look out!

501
00:49:54,087 --> 00:49:55,096
Watch out!

502
00:49:56,095 --> 00:49:57,093
Be careful!

503
00:50:35,050 --> 00:50:37,014
You stop messing the gear!

504
00:50:37,022 --> 00:50:38,024
Find a better road!

505
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:39,058
Let me.

506
00:50:39,066 --> 00:50:40,063
Go! Go! Go!

507
00:50:53,054 --> 00:50:55,026
Oh, no! We can't move!

508
00:51:01,038 --> 00:51:02,032
Do you know how to drive?

509
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:04,063
What do you expect?
I only have one arm.

510
00:51:05,046 --> 00:51:06,080
Move, I drive.

511
00:51:07,023 --> 00:51:08,060
We're stuck!

512
00:51:08,092 --> 00:51:10,076
Don't worry, I can figure out.

513
00:51:12,022 --> 00:51:14,014
Do something.
They're right behind!

514
00:51:46,095 --> 00:51:48,002
Back to the car.

515
00:52:09,037 --> 00:52:10,057
Car 54, in pursuit.

516
00:52:10,092 --> 00:52:13,019
- Hey! Watch out!
- I'm driving.
