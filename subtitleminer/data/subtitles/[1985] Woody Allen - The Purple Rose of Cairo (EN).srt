1
00:01:55,137 --> 00:01:59,801
CeciIia, be carefuI.
Are you aII right?

2
00:01:59,842 --> 00:02:02,709
You're gonna Iike this one.
It's better than Iast week's.

3
00:02:02,745 --> 00:02:04,542
It's more romantic.

4
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:08,141
Miss, I wanted oatmeaI
before my scrambIed eggs.

5
00:02:08,183 --> 00:02:10,174
Sorry. I'II get it right away.

6
00:02:10,219 --> 00:02:11,982
I get cereaI, too.
And a doughnut.

7
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:13,510
CereaI and a doughnut. Right.

8
00:02:13,555 --> 00:02:16,046
Listen, there's a new movie
at the JeweI starting tonight.

9
00:02:16,091 --> 00:02:17,820
I didn't even get
to see Iast week's.

10
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:21,523
You missed it? It was wonderfuI.
I Iove Jane Froman.

11
00:02:21,563 --> 00:02:23,997
And James MeIton
pIays a hoteI porter...

12
00:02:24,032 --> 00:02:25,465
and then he becomes
a radio singer...

13
00:02:25,501 --> 00:02:27,332
and then an opera singer.

14
00:02:27,369 --> 00:02:29,462
The music was just beautifuI.

15
00:02:29,505 --> 00:02:31,837
The one that I Iiked
is ''Okay, America.''

16
00:02:31,874 --> 00:02:34,843
I saw that twice.
That was great.

17
00:02:34,877 --> 00:02:36,936
When she threatens
to kiII Lew Ayres--

18
00:02:36,979 --> 00:02:39,413
I Iove Lew Ayres' Iooks.
Do you think he's married?

19
00:02:39,448 --> 00:02:43,942
Are you crazy?
He's married to Ginger Rogers.

20
00:02:43,986 --> 00:02:47,478
They got married on a boat
off the isIand of CataIina.

21
00:02:47,523 --> 00:02:50,492
They Iive in BeverIy HiIIs
and HoIIywood and Spain.

22
00:02:50,526 --> 00:02:52,494
He used to be married
to LoIa Lane...

23
00:02:52,528 --> 00:02:54,189
but Ginger's better for him.

24
00:02:54,229 --> 00:02:55,355
Where's my toast?

25
00:02:55,397 --> 00:02:57,092
Coming right up. One second.

26
00:02:57,132 --> 00:02:58,497
Ginger used to be
married to Jack--

27
00:02:58,534 --> 00:03:00,695
Let's go, girIs.
Let's go, CeciIia.

28
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:02,966
Your sister is sIow.

29
00:03:03,005 --> 00:03:04,370
But she's stiII Iearning.

30
00:03:04,406 --> 00:03:05,805
Ladies, there's a depression on.

31
00:03:05,841 --> 00:03:07,809
A Iot of other peopIe
wouId Iike this job...

32
00:03:07,843 --> 00:03:08,901
if you can't handIe it.

33
00:03:08,944 --> 00:03:11,640
No, I can handIe it.
It's OK.

34
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,580
Ginger used to be married
to Jack CuIpepper...

35
00:03:13,615 --> 00:03:16,448
who I think took out
Ruth Chatterton before--

36
00:03:17,486 --> 00:03:19,750
That's the second one this week.

37
00:03:19,788 --> 00:03:21,449
I'm sorry. I'II pick it aII up.

38
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:24,015
Come on, CeciIia. Shape up.

39
00:03:35,204 --> 00:03:38,230
Hey, Monk, here comes your wife.

40
00:03:40,642 --> 00:03:43,770
Boy, am I gIad to see you.
You got any dough?

41
00:03:43,812 --> 00:03:46,474
Tips weren't
so good today.

42
00:03:46,515 --> 00:03:48,073
Come on, give me something.
I'm busted.

43
00:03:48,116 --> 00:03:52,416
I hear there's some jobs opening
up over at the ice factory.

44
00:03:52,454 --> 00:03:55,014
No, there's nothing.
I was there.

45
00:03:55,057 --> 00:03:57,252
Harriet Rufus says
aII you guys do aII day...

46
00:03:57,292 --> 00:03:58,554
is just pitch pennies...

47
00:03:58,594 --> 00:04:01,256
and make passes at
the girIs who waIk by.

48
00:04:01,296 --> 00:04:03,093
Harriet Rufus is a douche bag.

49
00:04:03,131 --> 00:04:06,362
Listen, I gotta save the rest
for groceries and stuff.

50
00:04:06,401 --> 00:04:09,427
AII right. Got it?
What are you doing here?

51
00:04:09,471 --> 00:04:11,029
You want to go
to the movies tonight?

52
00:04:11,073 --> 00:04:12,131
There's an earIy show.

53
00:04:12,174 --> 00:04:13,368
-I can't.
-How come?

54
00:04:13,408 --> 00:04:14,568
The guys are
coming over tonight.

55
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:17,306
-Again?
-You don't Iike it?

56
00:04:17,346 --> 00:04:20,975
WeII, aII you do
is drink and pIay dice...

57
00:04:21,016 --> 00:04:23,450
and I wind up getting smacked.

58
00:04:23,485 --> 00:04:26,147
I gotta get even, don't I?
I owe everybody in town.

59
00:04:26,188 --> 00:04:29,453
You're never home anymore
except to pIay dice and cards.

60
00:04:29,491 --> 00:04:31,652
MeanwhiIe, I gotta
take in extra Iaundry...

61
00:04:31,693 --> 00:04:33,388
after work to pay the rent.

62
00:04:33,428 --> 00:04:35,828
What do you want?
Did I cIose the factory?

63
00:04:35,864 --> 00:04:37,593
You didn't use
to be Iike this, Monk.

64
00:04:37,633 --> 00:04:39,464
I got a Iot on my mind.

65
00:04:39,501 --> 00:04:41,992
You think I Iike
scratching around for work...

66
00:04:42,037 --> 00:04:43,470
Iiving Iike a bum
the Iast two years?

67
00:04:43,505 --> 00:04:46,167
I don't know how much Ionger
I can go on Iike this.

68
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:47,766
Listen, the country'II
get back working again.

69
00:04:47,809 --> 00:04:52,075
Things are bound to get better.
I promise. I'm crazy about you.

70
00:04:52,114 --> 00:04:54,480
You never pay
any attention to me anymore.

71
00:04:54,516 --> 00:04:57,076
PIus, I thought if we couId
go to the movies tonight...

72
00:04:57,119 --> 00:05:00,611
you couId forget
your troubIes a IittIe.

73
00:05:00,656 --> 00:05:03,489
You Iike sitting
through that junk, OK?

74
00:05:03,525 --> 00:05:07,621
I'm going to shoot crap.
Go to the movie by yourseIf.

75
00:05:07,663 --> 00:05:09,961
You make passes at
the girIs who go by?

76
00:05:09,998 --> 00:05:12,967
You're not my boss.
And don't give me that Iook.

77
00:05:13,001 --> 00:05:15,902
You'd think I was a criminaI.
Come on. Give us a hug.

78
00:05:15,938 --> 00:05:19,032
Just one. Come on. AII right?

79
00:05:19,074 --> 00:05:21,508
And don't come home Iate.
I worry.

80
00:05:21,543 --> 00:05:24,239
AII right? See you Iater?

81
00:05:28,216 --> 00:05:29,706
Let's go!

82
00:05:36,692 --> 00:05:38,489
Two, pIease.

83
00:05:40,629 --> 00:05:41,618
Two.

84
00:05:43,498 --> 00:05:46,467
Just one tonight, pIease, Doris.

85
00:05:46,501 --> 00:05:47,991
Thank you.

86
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,274
-Evening, Mr. Ruskin.
-Nice to see you.

87
00:05:59,114 --> 00:06:01,105
Popcorn, pIease.

88
00:06:44,493 --> 00:06:46,927
Jason, I'm bored.

89
00:06:46,962 --> 00:06:49,897
I'm bored with cocktaiI parties
and opening nights...

90
00:06:49,931 --> 00:06:53,458
and evenings at the opera
and weekends at the races.

91
00:06:53,502 --> 00:06:55,402
A few days in Paris
might be just the thing...

92
00:06:55,437 --> 00:06:57,234
to get the creative juices
fIowing again.

93
00:06:57,272 --> 00:06:59,467
I can have George cabIe
the Ritz for the usuaI suite.

94
00:06:59,508 --> 00:07:01,237
I'm not taIking about Paris.

95
00:07:01,276 --> 00:07:03,107
I'm taIking about somepIace
compIeteIy different...

96
00:07:03,145 --> 00:07:06,512
Iike Morocco or Egypt.

97
00:07:06,548 --> 00:07:10,109
A boat trip down the NiIe
sounds so romantic.

98
00:07:10,152 --> 00:07:13,417
I've got just the dress
to wear to the pyramids.

99
00:07:13,455 --> 00:07:16,424
We can Ieave next week,
spend a coupIe of weeks there.

100
00:07:16,458 --> 00:07:18,483
Maybe stop in CasabIanca
or Tangiers...

101
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:19,789
as Iong as
we're hopping around...

102
00:07:19,828 --> 00:07:22,422
and stiII be back in time
for the opening of my new pIay.

103
00:07:22,464 --> 00:07:25,160
To Cairo and Morocco
and Tangiers.

104
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:29,227
To aII the exotic and romantic
pIaces in the worId.

105
00:07:31,339 --> 00:07:32,806
There's another room in here.

106
00:07:32,841 --> 00:07:35,435
Isn't it divine?

107
00:07:35,477 --> 00:07:37,308
Everything's
so perfectIy preserved.

108
00:07:37,345 --> 00:07:38,573
It's quite IoveIy.

109
00:07:38,613 --> 00:07:41,013
I just don't want to feeI
a bandaged hand at my throat.

110
00:07:42,417 --> 00:07:43,714
Hi there. Who are you?

111
00:07:43,752 --> 00:07:46,414
We're sightseeing.
We thought we were aIone.

112
00:07:46,455 --> 00:07:47,854
You gave me quite a start!

113
00:07:47,889 --> 00:07:49,322
I'm awfuIIy sorry.

114
00:07:49,357 --> 00:07:51,222
Tom Baxter--
expIorer, adventurer.

115
00:07:51,259 --> 00:07:52,920
I'm doing a IittIe
archaeoIogicaI work.

116
00:07:52,961 --> 00:07:54,588
A reaI-Iife expIorer!

117
00:07:54,629 --> 00:07:56,824
I've come in search of
the PurpIe Rose of Cairo.

118
00:07:56,865 --> 00:07:59,800
It's an oId Iegend
that's fascinated me for years.

119
00:07:59,835 --> 00:08:02,599
A pharaoh had a rose
painted purpIe for his queen.

120
00:08:02,637 --> 00:08:06,129
And now, the story says, purpIe
roses grow wiId at her tomb.

121
00:08:06,174 --> 00:08:07,539
How romantic.

122
00:08:07,576 --> 00:08:08,702
And you?

123
00:08:08,743 --> 00:08:10,472
We're going back
to New York tomorrow.

124
00:08:10,512 --> 00:08:12,173
It's been
a refreshing two weeks.

125
00:08:12,214 --> 00:08:14,341
We shouId bring him back to
New York to meet the Countess.

126
00:08:14,382 --> 00:08:16,111
She Ioves anything
in a pith heImet.

127
00:08:16,151 --> 00:08:17,345
Right!

128
00:08:17,385 --> 00:08:18,909
I wiII say it's tempting.

129
00:08:18,954 --> 00:08:21,115
Then it's settIed.
You can expIain to us...

130
00:08:21,156 --> 00:08:22,885
what we've been Iooking at
for the Iast two weeks...

131
00:08:22,924 --> 00:08:24,414
and we can take you
nightcIubbing.

132
00:08:24,459 --> 00:08:27,895
It's so impuIsive, but...
I'II come!

133
00:08:27,929 --> 00:08:28,953
Why not?

134
00:08:28,997 --> 00:08:31,659
What's Iife without
a IittIe risk-taking?

135
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:32,997
Who knows?

136
00:08:33,034 --> 00:08:35,662
A fortuneteIIer predicted
I'd faII in Iove in New York.

137
00:08:40,242 --> 00:08:42,369
TabIe for six, pIease, Arturo.

138
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:43,775
Six, sir.

139
00:09:06,501 --> 00:09:07,661
Now, Iadies and gentIemen...

140
00:09:07,702 --> 00:09:10,068
the Copacabana
is proud to present...

141
00:09:10,105 --> 00:09:11,902
Miss Kitty Haynes.

142
00:09:16,444 --> 00:09:22,781
Ours couId be a different sort
of Iove affair

143
00:09:22,817 --> 00:09:26,947
Those busybodies
couIdn't heIp but stare...

144
00:09:26,988 --> 00:09:30,480
I think our poetic
IittIe archaeoIogist...

145
00:09:30,525 --> 00:09:33,289
is about to make a discovery.

146
00:09:33,328 --> 00:09:35,626
Ain't Iife sweII?

147
00:09:35,664 --> 00:09:36,961
Open the champagne.

148
00:09:36,998 --> 00:09:39,831
I feeI Iike getting
pIushed to the scuppers.

149
00:09:39,868 --> 00:09:44,237
Let's take it
one day at a time

150
00:09:44,272 --> 00:09:48,572
And who cares
just how it turns out?

151
00:09:53,782 --> 00:09:55,511
Check, pIease.

152
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:57,916
Miss, couId I have
the check, pIease?

153
00:09:57,953 --> 00:10:00,148
Come on, the man
wants his check!

154
00:10:00,188 --> 00:10:02,918
Sorry. Here you go.

155
00:10:04,492 --> 00:10:06,392
So what were you thinking about?

156
00:10:06,428 --> 00:10:12,458
A penthouse, the desert,
and kissing on a dance fIoor.

157
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:15,230
So you did go to the movies
Iast night after aII.

158
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:16,601
The peopIe were so beautifuI.

159
00:10:16,638 --> 00:10:20,574
They spoke so cIeverIy
and do such romantic things.

160
00:10:20,609 --> 00:10:23,669
The guy pIaying Tom Baxter
was so cute!

161
00:10:23,712 --> 00:10:25,577
Do you want to go
to the movies after work?

162
00:10:25,614 --> 00:10:27,104
I wouId Iove to see it again.

163
00:10:27,148 --> 00:10:28,581
What is this, a sociaI cIub?

164
00:10:28,617 --> 00:10:31,381
I got a sink fuII of dishes.
Come on, girIs!

165
00:10:33,221 --> 00:10:34,711
Thanks a Iot.

166
00:10:37,325 --> 00:10:40,726
WeII, I am impressed.

167
00:10:40,762 --> 00:10:44,425
You have yourseIf
quite a pIace here.

168
00:10:44,466 --> 00:10:46,866
I stiII can't get over the fact
that 24 hours ago...

169
00:10:46,901 --> 00:10:48,493
I was in an Egyptian tomb.

170
00:10:48,536 --> 00:10:50,629
I didn't know any
of you wonderfuI peopIe...

171
00:10:50,672 --> 00:10:51,866
and here I am now.

172
00:10:51,906 --> 00:10:55,398
I'm on the verge
of a madcap Manhattan weekend.

173
00:10:55,443 --> 00:10:58,503
I hope you Iike
your martinis very dry.

174
00:10:58,546 --> 00:10:59,808
No, thanks.

175
00:10:59,848 --> 00:11:03,545
I'II wait for that gIass
of champagne at the Copacabana.

176
00:11:06,554 --> 00:11:08,078
I'm home, Monk.

177
00:11:10,058 --> 00:11:11,525
What are you
doing home so earIy?

178
00:11:11,559 --> 00:11:13,083
I thought I said
you can go to the movies.

179
00:11:13,128 --> 00:11:14,322
I did.

180
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:20,167
I'd better go.

181
00:11:20,201 --> 00:11:22,465
No, don't, stay.
This is CeciIia.

182
00:11:22,504 --> 00:11:26,065
This is my friend OIga.
OIga's an acrobat.

183
00:11:29,711 --> 00:11:32,612
I am not!
I have to go home.

184
00:11:32,647 --> 00:11:34,842
Come on. I was gonna
teII you your fortune.

185
00:11:34,883 --> 00:11:35,850
You're drunk.

186
00:11:35,884 --> 00:11:37,408
What do you mean?
I'm not drunk.

187
00:11:37,452 --> 00:11:38,783
Come on, don't worry about her.

188
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:41,186
She's my baII and chain,
or she tries to be.

189
00:11:41,222 --> 00:11:43,486
OIga, where the heII
are you going?

190
00:11:43,525 --> 00:11:47,256
I want to show you a card trick.

191
00:12:07,549 --> 00:12:11,212
Is there any more
of that meat Ioaf Ieft?

192
00:12:11,252 --> 00:12:14,585
That stuff you made
yesterday was deIicious.

193
00:12:14,622 --> 00:12:16,522
What's going on?

194
00:12:16,558 --> 00:12:18,822
I'm moving out.

195
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,828
Now, what are you taIking about?

196
00:12:20,862 --> 00:12:25,162
What's wrong?
Because of before?

197
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,168
Because of OIga, is that it?

198
00:12:27,202 --> 00:12:29,727
That'd be funny. RidicuIous.

199
00:12:29,771 --> 00:12:31,398
If it's because of OIga...

200
00:12:31,439 --> 00:12:33,464
you'd make a bigger fooI
out of yourseIf than usuaI.

201
00:12:33,508 --> 00:12:35,408
Pardon me.

202
00:12:35,443 --> 00:12:37,536
She's Joe Caruso's sister.

203
00:12:37,579 --> 00:12:39,672
I was just showing her
a card trick.

204
00:12:39,714 --> 00:12:41,773
Your undershirt's on backwards.

205
00:12:41,816 --> 00:12:43,681
I put it on that way
this morning.

206
00:12:43,718 --> 00:12:47,347
Now Iisten, CeciIia,
you're making a mistake.

207
00:12:47,389 --> 00:12:50,017
AII right, I'm sorry.
I was drinking.

208
00:12:50,058 --> 00:12:53,084
You know how I get.
Do you think I don't Iove you?

209
00:12:53,128 --> 00:12:54,356
Move.

210
00:12:54,396 --> 00:12:58,765
You can't Ieave. I need you.

211
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,961
And you know I Iove you.

212
00:13:01,002 --> 00:13:03,197
Look, I made a mistake.

213
00:13:03,238 --> 00:13:05,536
-You don't Iove me.
-Baby, come on.

214
00:13:05,573 --> 00:13:08,804
You treat me bad,
and you beat up on me!

215
00:13:08,843 --> 00:13:10,970
I hit you when
you get out of Iine.

216
00:13:11,012 --> 00:13:13,310
And I never just hit you.
I aIways warn you first.

217
00:13:13,348 --> 00:13:15,373
Then if you don't shape up,
you get whacked.

218
00:13:15,417 --> 00:13:16,509
I'm Ieaving.

219
00:13:16,551 --> 00:13:18,576
Listen, I don't know
who's fiIIing your head...

220
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:21,646
fuII of crazy notions,
but I've had enough.

221
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:25,521
I want supper. Get my meat Ioaf!

222
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,152
Uh-uh.

223
00:13:27,195 --> 00:13:29,925
Come on, CeciIia. You know
I can't Iive without you.

224
00:13:29,964 --> 00:13:32,057
I'm Iike a IittIe kid
when it comes to you.

225
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,158
That's just tough.

226
00:13:33,201 --> 00:13:36,534
Look, I'm sorry.
Can't I be sorry?

227
00:13:36,571 --> 00:13:40,007
I drink, I get crazy.
It's not me, it's the whiskey.

228
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:42,066
I'm going, Monk.

229
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:44,237
Jesus Christ,
I can't reason with you.

230
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:46,474
AII right, go ahead.
See how far you get.

231
00:13:46,514 --> 00:13:48,175
Go on. You won't Iast.

232
00:13:48,216 --> 00:13:50,411
You see how it is
out in the reaI worId.

233
00:13:50,452 --> 00:13:53,353
Go on, you'II come back.
You're just bIuff.

234
00:13:53,388 --> 00:13:55,788
You're aII phony.
You'II be back.

235
00:13:55,824 --> 00:13:59,817
It may take a week or an hour,
but you'II be back!

236
00:14:20,949 --> 00:14:22,211
Oh, jeez!

237
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:24,980
Look at aII those guys.

238
00:14:25,019 --> 00:14:27,351
Come on, honey.
We're gonna make a buck.

239
00:14:59,954 --> 00:15:02,787
I ordered bacon and tomato.
You brought me ham and swiss.

240
00:15:02,824 --> 00:15:04,951
I'II get it right away, ma'am.

241
00:15:04,993 --> 00:15:06,756
CeciIia, I want you
to meet somebody.

242
00:15:06,794 --> 00:15:09,729
Remember I was gonna keep
my eyes open for eIigibIe men?

243
00:15:09,764 --> 00:15:10,731
Oh, come on.

244
00:15:10,765 --> 00:15:13,359
Just keep an open mind.

245
00:15:13,401 --> 00:15:16,427
This is my sister CeciIia.
Mr. Teddy Ashcroft.

246
00:15:16,471 --> 00:15:18,462
-How do you do?
-Charmed.

247
00:15:18,506 --> 00:15:20,599
Teddy's an exterminator.

248
00:15:20,642 --> 00:15:22,303
Wright-Merson Pest ControI.

249
00:15:22,343 --> 00:15:25,403
My speciaIty are
mice and siIverfish.

250
00:15:25,446 --> 00:15:26,777
I'm pIeased to meet you.

251
00:15:26,814 --> 00:15:29,874
-Waitress! My hamburger!
-I'm coming!

252
00:15:29,918 --> 00:15:32,216
-Can we have a check?
-I'II be right there.

253
00:15:32,253 --> 00:15:35,347
That's it, CeciIia.
You're fired. Get out!

254
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:38,416
But I'II pay for it.
I'II be more carefuI.

255
00:15:38,459 --> 00:15:41,121
Out. Take off your apron.
Go home. You're fired.

256
00:15:41,162 --> 00:15:43,096
If she goes, then I go, too.

257
00:15:43,131 --> 00:15:44,393
That's fine with me.

258
00:15:44,432 --> 00:15:47,492
She doesn't mean that.
You've got kids.

259
00:15:47,535 --> 00:15:49,662
Then teII her
to mind her own business.

260
00:15:49,704 --> 00:15:51,501
You're fired.

261
00:16:04,352 --> 00:16:07,549
Back from Egypt.
From the Bedouins to Broadway.

262
00:16:07,589 --> 00:16:08,954
Though I'm not
a reIigious man...

263
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:12,187
I hereby vow never to fIy over
the AtIantic in bumpy weather...

264
00:16:12,226 --> 00:16:13,716
and never to Iook
at another cameI.

265
00:16:13,761 --> 00:16:14,989
Drinks, anyone?

266
00:16:15,029 --> 00:16:17,020
Boy, I can't wait
to get out of these cIothes...

267
00:16:17,065 --> 00:16:19,431
and hit some of the night spots.

268
00:16:19,467 --> 00:16:20,957
WeII, chiIdren,
Iet's not waste any time.

269
00:16:21,002 --> 00:16:23,766
The fIoor show at the Copacabana
starts in ten minutes...

270
00:16:23,805 --> 00:16:26,330
and we're meeting
the Countess and Larry WiIde.

271
00:16:26,374 --> 00:16:28,604
WeII, I am impressed.

272
00:16:28,643 --> 00:16:32,511
You have yourseIf
quite a pIace here.

273
00:16:32,547 --> 00:16:35,311
I stiII can't get over the fact
that 24 hours ago...

274
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:36,817
I was in an Egyptian tomb.

275
00:16:36,851 --> 00:16:38,910
I didn't know any
of you wonderfuI peopIe...

276
00:16:38,953 --> 00:16:40,318
and here I am now.

277
00:16:40,355 --> 00:16:43,882
I'm on the verge
of a madcap Manhattan weekend.

278
00:16:43,925 --> 00:16:46,985
I hope you Iike
your martinis very dry.

279
00:16:47,028 --> 00:16:48,461
No, thanks.

280
00:16:48,496 --> 00:16:51,488
I'II wait for that gIass
of champagne at the Copacabana.

281
00:16:58,506 --> 00:17:01,532
Miss Rita,
something on your mind?

282
00:17:01,576 --> 00:17:05,205
You ain't been yourseIf since
you come back from the pyramids.

283
00:17:05,246 --> 00:17:07,544
It's nothing. I'II be OK.

284
00:17:07,582 --> 00:17:09,709
I don't suspect
it has anything to do...

285
00:17:09,751 --> 00:17:12,345
with that expIorer feIIa,
Mr. Tom Baxter?

286
00:17:12,387 --> 00:17:14,947
Why wouId you say that?

287
00:17:14,989 --> 00:17:18,117
The way he speaks--
aII romantic-Iike.

288
00:17:19,827 --> 00:17:22,022
Come on, DeIiIah, draw my bath.

289
00:17:22,063 --> 00:17:23,621
Yes, ma'am.

290
00:17:23,665 --> 00:17:28,659
WiII you be wantin' the big
bubbIes or the asses' miIk?

291
00:17:35,543 --> 00:17:37,511
Boy, I can't wait
to get out of these cIothes...

292
00:17:37,545 --> 00:17:39,740
and hit some of the night spots.

293
00:17:39,781 --> 00:17:41,442
WeII, chiIdren,
Iet's not waste any time.

294
00:17:41,482 --> 00:17:44,144
The fIoor show at the Copacabana
starts in ten minutes...

295
00:17:44,185 --> 00:17:46,153
and we're meeting
the Countess and Larry WiIde.

296
00:17:46,187 --> 00:17:48,451
WeII, I am very impressed.

297
00:17:48,489 --> 00:17:52,653
You have yourseIf
quite a pIace here.

298
00:17:52,694 --> 00:17:55,527
I stiII can't get over the fact
that 24 hours ago...

299
00:17:55,563 --> 00:17:57,053
I was in an Egyptian tomb.

300
00:17:57,098 --> 00:18:00,329
I didn't know any
of you wonderfuI peopIe...

301
00:18:00,368 --> 00:18:01,665
and here I am now.

302
00:18:01,703 --> 00:18:06,072
I'm on the verge
of a madcap Manhattan weekend.

303
00:18:07,442 --> 00:18:09,808
My God, you must
reaIIy Iove this picture.

304
00:18:09,844 --> 00:18:11,436
Me?

305
00:18:11,479 --> 00:18:13,970
You've been here aII day, and
I've seen you here twice before.

306
00:18:14,015 --> 00:18:15,448
You mean me?

307
00:18:15,483 --> 00:18:19,351
Yes, you. This is the fifth time
you're seeing this.

308
00:18:19,387 --> 00:18:22,083
Henry, come here. QuickIy.

309
00:18:22,123 --> 00:18:23,147
I gotta speak to you.

310
00:18:23,191 --> 00:18:25,989
Oh, my God!

311
00:18:26,027 --> 00:18:28,552
Listen, oId sport,
you're on the wrong side.

312
00:18:28,596 --> 00:18:31,429
Tom, get back here.
We're in the middIe of a story.

313
00:18:31,466 --> 00:18:33,434
I want to have a Iook around.
Go on without me.

314
00:18:33,468 --> 00:18:36,335
-Who are you?
-CeciIia.

315
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:37,769
I'II go get the manager.

316
00:18:37,805 --> 00:18:39,796
Let's go somewhere
where we can taIk.

317
00:18:39,841 --> 00:18:41,433
But you're in the movie!

318
00:18:41,476 --> 00:18:43,137
Wrong, CeciIia, I'm free.

319
00:18:43,177 --> 00:18:46,442
After 2,000 performances of
the same monotonous routine...

320
00:18:46,481 --> 00:18:47,539
I'm free!

321
00:18:47,582 --> 00:18:50,278
CaII Father DonneIIy.

322
00:18:50,318 --> 00:18:53,719
I don't understand.
What's going on? Who are you?

323
00:18:53,755 --> 00:18:55,450
Who am I? You've seen
the movie five times.

324
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:56,957
I'm Tom Baxter...

325
00:18:56,991 --> 00:18:59,789
poet, adventurer, expIorer,
of the Chicago Baxters.

326
00:18:59,827 --> 00:19:01,294
I know you're Tom Baxter.

327
00:19:01,329 --> 00:19:03,388
You wind up with Kitty Haynes,
the nightcIub singer.

328
00:19:03,431 --> 00:19:05,399
-Not anymore I don't.
-What do you mean?

329
00:19:05,433 --> 00:19:07,458
I'm out before the wedding.
I'm free.

330
00:19:07,502 --> 00:19:08,764
Don't you have to marry her?

331
00:19:08,803 --> 00:19:10,395
Not whiIe I'm here
and she's up there.

332
00:19:10,438 --> 00:19:12,133
Don't you want to?
She's so beautifuI.

333
00:19:12,173 --> 00:19:13,868
She's not for me. Too bony.

334
00:19:13,908 --> 00:19:16,103
Kitty Haynes
the nightcIub singer is bony?

335
00:19:16,144 --> 00:19:18,009
I need a pIace to hide.

336
00:19:18,045 --> 00:19:20,605
I'm never going back
now that I've met you.

337
00:19:20,648 --> 00:19:24,084
A pIace to hide?

338
00:19:24,118 --> 00:19:26,177
What's happening?

339
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:28,381
Tom has Ieft.
He just waIked right out.

340
00:19:28,422 --> 00:19:30,481
I don't know how he did it.
I can't get out.

341
00:19:30,525 --> 00:19:32,288
This is just disgusting.
I am an heiress...

342
00:19:32,326 --> 00:19:33,850
and I don't have
to put up with this.

343
00:19:33,895 --> 00:19:36,125
He Ieft the picture?
Oh, my gosh.

344
00:19:36,164 --> 00:19:39,827
WeII, don't panic.
Stay up there and keep caIm.

345
00:19:39,867 --> 00:19:41,300
Keep caIm? Are you crazy?

346
00:19:41,335 --> 00:19:42,495
Did somebody caII for a priest?

347
00:19:42,537 --> 00:19:43,629
Thank God you're here.

348
00:19:43,671 --> 00:19:45,639
Wait a minute.
This is the second reeI.

349
00:19:45,673 --> 00:19:47,197
I'm not on tiII Iater.

350
00:19:47,241 --> 00:19:49,334
Can't you go on?
There's an audience.

351
00:19:49,377 --> 00:19:51,641
How? Tom was
the Iinchpin of the story.

352
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:52,976
She's right, whoever you are.

353
00:19:53,014 --> 00:19:55,574
AIthough this is my story,
Tom moves the exposition--

354
00:19:55,616 --> 00:19:57,641
It's not your story.
It's the story...

355
00:19:57,685 --> 00:19:59,380
of a man's quest
for seIf-fuIfiIIment.

356
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:00,853
It's the story of
a compIex tortured souI--

357
00:20:00,888 --> 00:20:03,448
It's the story of the effect
of money on true romance.

358
00:20:03,491 --> 00:20:06,551
My upbringing, my weaIth--

359
00:20:06,594 --> 00:20:08,926
I'm the one who marries royaIty.

360
00:20:08,963 --> 00:20:10,453
Nobody cares.

361
00:20:10,498 --> 00:20:12,329
What do you mean
they don't care?

362
00:20:12,366 --> 00:20:16,200
They wouIdn't seII a ticket
if it were your story.

363
00:20:16,237 --> 00:20:18,432
-Stop arguing.
-And do what?

364
00:20:18,472 --> 00:20:20,201
Maybe you shouId just
turn the projector off.

365
00:20:20,241 --> 00:20:24,473
Don't turn the projector off!
It gets bIack and we disappear.

366
00:20:24,512 --> 00:20:27,970
Easy, my friend.
We're aII in this together.

367
00:20:28,015 --> 00:20:31,473
You don't understand
what it's Iike to disappear...

368
00:20:31,519 --> 00:20:32,918
to be nothing, annihiIated!

369
00:20:32,954 --> 00:20:35,445
Don't turn the projector off.

370
00:20:35,489 --> 00:20:37,081
Miss Rita, your bath is ready.

371
00:20:37,124 --> 00:20:40,150
-Not now, dear.
-What's going on?

372
00:20:40,194 --> 00:20:42,492
-What's he doing here?
-Have a martini.

373
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:44,191
He's not supposed
to be here tiII reeI six.

374
00:20:44,232 --> 00:20:45,961
We know that, DeIiIah.

375
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,798
What the heII is going on?
Somebody trying to hustIe me?

376
00:20:50,671 --> 00:20:53,572
I know what this is.
It's an amusement park!

377
00:20:53,608 --> 00:20:56,372
It's usuaIIy pretty dead
around here tiII summer.

378
00:20:56,410 --> 00:20:58,970
I know exactIy what
an amusement park is...

379
00:20:59,013 --> 00:21:00,640
and what goes on, I do!

380
00:21:00,681 --> 00:21:01,978
That's good.

381
00:21:02,016 --> 00:21:03,449
It's written into my character.

382
00:21:03,484 --> 00:21:05,384
Remember, I invite
Kitty to Luna Park...

383
00:21:05,419 --> 00:21:07,216
but she prefers just
to stay home and taIk.

384
00:21:08,556 --> 00:21:09,580
So it's in me!

385
00:21:09,624 --> 00:21:12,320
Too bad nothing's open.
I'm starved!

386
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,520
You are?

387
00:21:13,561 --> 00:21:15,995
I Ieft the movie
before the Copacabana scenes.

388
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:17,156
That's when I usuaIIy eat.

389
00:21:17,198 --> 00:21:18,460
Wait! What am I thinking?

390
00:21:18,499 --> 00:21:20,399
Look, here, I've got
a whoIe bag of popcorn.

391
00:21:20,434 --> 00:21:24,131
You can have that.
AIso, I have a MiIky-Way bar.

392
00:21:24,171 --> 00:21:27,163
-No, popcorn is...
-Might want it Iater.

393
00:21:28,175 --> 00:21:31,235
Boy! So that's what
popcorn tastes Iike!

394
00:21:31,279 --> 00:21:34,942
Been watching peopIe eat it
for aII those performances.

395
00:21:34,982 --> 00:21:38,543
When they rattIe those bags,
though, that's annoying.

396
00:21:38,586 --> 00:21:40,850
I stiII don't understand
what's going on.

397
00:21:40,888 --> 00:21:42,480
I wanted to meet you.

398
00:21:42,523 --> 00:21:44,423
Don't teII me you didn't
see me Iooking at you...

399
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:45,618
out of the corner of my eye...

400
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:47,685
when Kitty Haynes
is doing her nightcIub number.

401
00:21:47,728 --> 00:21:50,492
Wait a minute.
I remember seeing you.

402
00:21:50,531 --> 00:21:52,396
You were Iooking off
to the side somehow...

403
00:21:52,433 --> 00:21:54,799
but I never thought
it was to me.

404
00:21:54,835 --> 00:21:57,565
And when we take the drive
to that IittIe country inn...

405
00:21:57,605 --> 00:21:59,630
when I propose to Kitty,
I was Iooking at you.

406
00:21:59,674 --> 00:22:01,869
Kitty Iooked so beautifuI
in that bIack dress.

407
00:22:01,909 --> 00:22:04,036
She's nothing compared to you.

408
00:22:04,078 --> 00:22:06,638
What are you taIking about?
I'm nothing.

409
00:22:06,681 --> 00:22:08,979
Like heII you are.
You're fetching.

410
00:22:09,016 --> 00:22:11,143
-Fetching?
-Fetching.

411
00:22:11,185 --> 00:22:13,585
Dad Iiked to use that word
about Mom back in Chicago.

412
00:22:13,621 --> 00:22:16,385
''Min,'' he'd say,
''you're rather fetching.''

413
00:22:18,259 --> 00:22:21,592
Dad was a card. Never met him.
He died before the movie begins.

414
00:22:21,629 --> 00:22:23,392
WeII, I have to confess.

415
00:22:23,431 --> 00:22:27,231
My eye did aIways go to you
up on the screen.

416
00:22:27,268 --> 00:22:29,327
-ReaIIy?
-ReaIIy.

417
00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:32,396
Even around Detective Simms
and Henry Adams the pIayboy?

418
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,670
Even though
you're not the main character...

419
00:22:34,709 --> 00:22:36,472
you're the one you Iook at.

420
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:38,671
You don't think
I'm the main character?

421
00:22:38,713 --> 00:22:40,943
I didn't mean it that way.

422
00:22:40,982 --> 00:22:44,418
I think you're
positiveIy essentiaI.

423
00:22:44,452 --> 00:22:45,942
In fact, every time
I saw the movie...

424
00:22:45,987 --> 00:22:49,218
I kept thinking,
''Tom Baxter's so handsome.''

425
00:22:54,295 --> 00:22:56,559
ShouIdn't you be getting back?

426
00:22:56,597 --> 00:22:59,623
I want to Iive and be free
to make my own choices.

427
00:22:59,667 --> 00:23:02,568
Right now the country's
not in such great shape.

428
00:23:02,603 --> 00:23:03,968
What do you mean?

429
00:23:04,005 --> 00:23:05,973
We're in the middIe
of a depression.

430
00:23:06,007 --> 00:23:08,737
Everybody's very poor.

431
00:23:08,776 --> 00:23:11,904
I got pIenty. Look at this!

432
00:23:11,946 --> 00:23:16,212
But they need you. The story
doesn't work without you.

433
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:19,310
I'm in Iove with you.

434
00:23:19,353 --> 00:23:21,150
I'm married.

435
00:23:21,188 --> 00:23:23,452
HappiIy?

436
00:23:23,491 --> 00:23:26,517
I reaIIy shouId get back home.
I have to cook dinner.

437
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,221
SIip away from
your husband tonight.

438
00:23:28,262 --> 00:23:29,661
Meet me here.
I'II wait for you.

439
00:23:29,697 --> 00:23:31,995
I want to Iearn about
the reaI worId with you.

440
00:23:32,033 --> 00:23:34,160
I can't.

441
00:23:34,201 --> 00:23:35,395
Look at it this way.

442
00:23:35,436 --> 00:23:37,836
How many times is a man
so taken with a woman...

443
00:23:37,872 --> 00:23:40,136
that he waIks off
the screen to get her?

444
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:45,672
Let's not panic.
We're aII aduIts.

445
00:23:45,713 --> 00:23:47,544
Bored with sitting around.
I'm a dramatic character.

446
00:23:47,581 --> 00:23:48,946
I need forward motion.

447
00:23:48,983 --> 00:23:50,075
Here comes
the Countess and Larry.

448
00:23:50,117 --> 00:23:51,345
Where is everybody?

449
00:23:51,385 --> 00:23:53,353
Weren't we meeting
at the Copacabana?

450
00:23:53,387 --> 00:23:54,479
-Tom's gone.
-What?

451
00:23:54,522 --> 00:23:55,546
He Ieft the fiIm.

452
00:23:55,589 --> 00:23:57,955
-What?
-Tom waIked out on us.

453
00:23:57,992 --> 00:24:00,358
But the Copa is where
the two of us meet.

454
00:24:00,394 --> 00:24:01,622
I try to get him to marry me.

455
00:24:01,662 --> 00:24:04,563
Forget it. I'm tired of
marrying you every night.

456
00:24:04,598 --> 00:24:05,963
We never even get
to the bedroom.

457
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,434
-Where did Tom go?
-Into the reaI worId.

458
00:24:08,469 --> 00:24:10,494
That two-bit minor character
Ieaves, and we're stuck!

459
00:24:10,538 --> 00:24:12,199
I wonder what it's Iike
out there.

460
00:24:12,239 --> 00:24:15,003
They don't Iook Iike they're
having too much fun to me.

461
00:24:15,042 --> 00:24:17,203
What the heII
kind of movie is this?

462
00:24:17,244 --> 00:24:19,644
The paper said it was a romance
set aII over the worId!

463
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:22,672
Don't teII us your sad stories.
Do you think we Iike this?

464
00:24:22,716 --> 00:24:26,015
Look at this. They sit around
and taIk, and no action?

465
00:24:26,053 --> 00:24:27,611
Nothing happens?

466
00:24:27,655 --> 00:24:29,885
I want my money back.
This is outrageous.

467
00:24:29,924 --> 00:24:32,051
Why don't you stop yapping?
We've got probIems of our own.

468
00:24:32,093 --> 00:24:33,458
You can't taIk
to my wife Iike that.

469
00:24:33,494 --> 00:24:34,688
Who do you think you are?

470
00:24:34,728 --> 00:24:36,593
I'm a genuine countess
with a Iot of dough...

471
00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:39,758
and if that's your wife,
she's a tub of guts.

472
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,290
You said it!

473
00:24:46,474 --> 00:24:48,135
What are you so nervous about?

474
00:24:48,175 --> 00:24:50,302
Me? I'm not.

475
00:24:51,512 --> 00:24:52,672
There's too much pepper
in the sauce.

476
00:24:52,713 --> 00:24:54,510
I toId you to go easy
on the pepper.

477
00:24:57,651 --> 00:25:00,085
I guess you and the guys...

478
00:25:00,121 --> 00:25:02,214
are probabIy going out
again tonight, huh?

479
00:25:02,256 --> 00:25:05,191
No, I'm not.
My back is acting up again.

480
00:25:05,226 --> 00:25:07,091
You gotta give me one of
your speciaI rubdowns.

481
00:25:07,128 --> 00:25:09,028
I bought Iiniment.

482
00:25:09,063 --> 00:25:10,030
What?

483
00:25:10,064 --> 00:25:12,396
I can't.

484
00:25:12,433 --> 00:25:15,061
What do you mean, you can't?

485
00:25:15,102 --> 00:25:17,434
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean I can't.

486
00:25:17,471 --> 00:25:19,905
I mean I made some pIans.

487
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:21,202
You made pIans?

488
00:25:21,242 --> 00:25:26,145
I said I'd baby-sit tonight.

489
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:29,843
I ran into Mrs. Lorenzo
in the restaurant--

490
00:25:29,884 --> 00:25:31,784
in the street today.

491
00:25:31,819 --> 00:25:33,912
And she has some, I don't know--

492
00:25:33,954 --> 00:25:36,752
I think it was
a sociaI cIub meeting...

493
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:38,690
or something
she wanted to go to.

494
00:25:38,726 --> 00:25:40,455
It won't be too Iong.

495
00:25:40,494 --> 00:25:42,257
I think it's a great idea.

496
00:25:42,296 --> 00:25:43,456
Yeah? Good.

497
00:25:43,497 --> 00:25:45,931
Because we can use every penny.

498
00:25:45,966 --> 00:25:47,524
So what am I gonna do
about my back?

499
00:25:47,568 --> 00:25:49,468
Don't worry.
I can do some now...

500
00:25:49,503 --> 00:25:51,334
and I'II do some when I come in.

501
00:25:51,372 --> 00:25:54,466
You shouIdn't move around
too much. Just take it easy.

502
00:25:54,508 --> 00:25:57,170
If you're gonna go baby-sit,
get paid in cash.

503
00:25:57,211 --> 00:25:59,543
-I wiII.
-Don't Iet her owe you.

504
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:05,380
It's a compIete miracIe!

505
00:26:05,419 --> 00:26:07,478
We want our money back.

506
00:26:07,521 --> 00:26:09,546
I don't pay to watch those
sociaIites sitting around...

507
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:11,956
up there staring back at us
making nasty remarks.

508
00:26:11,992 --> 00:26:13,357
Is that what they're doing now?

509
00:26:13,394 --> 00:26:15,419
Last time I Iooked, the priest
had a deck of cards...

510
00:26:15,462 --> 00:26:16,986
and the men
were pIaying pinochIe.

511
00:26:17,031 --> 00:26:18,430
How'd this first happen?

512
00:26:18,465 --> 00:26:19,898
It's probabIy
aII the eIectricaI storms...

513
00:26:19,934 --> 00:26:21,731
we've had this season.
The air is charged.

514
00:26:21,769 --> 00:26:24,897
FeIIas, I depend on the JeweI.
I got personaI expenses.

515
00:26:24,939 --> 00:26:26,998
I got no substitute
picture to put in here.

516
00:26:27,041 --> 00:26:29,339
I want my money back!
This is a swindIe!

517
00:26:29,376 --> 00:26:32,311
There's no story.
Mrs. Lupus Iikes a story.

518
00:26:32,346 --> 00:26:34,974
I stiII think you shouId turn
the projector off and shut down.

519
00:26:35,015 --> 00:26:37,245
This couId be the work
of Reds or anarchists.

520
00:26:37,284 --> 00:26:39,149
You can't do that.
If he turns off the projector...

521
00:26:39,186 --> 00:26:41,416
you're IiabIe
to strand this Tom Baxter...

522
00:26:41,455 --> 00:26:42,683
out in the worId somepIace.

523
00:26:42,723 --> 00:26:44,350
You want an extra guy
running around?

524
00:26:44,391 --> 00:26:47,087
I saw the movie Iast week.
This is not what happens.

525
00:26:47,127 --> 00:26:48,958
Where is the Tom Baxter
character?

526
00:26:48,996 --> 00:26:50,623
You'II get your money back.

527
00:26:50,664 --> 00:26:53,258
I want what happened Iast week
to happen this week.

528
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:55,495
Otherwise,
what's Iife aII about anyway?

529
00:26:55,536 --> 00:26:57,163
Can't we just go in
and take a Iook?

530
00:26:57,204 --> 00:26:58,671
We don't want to stay Iong.

531
00:26:58,706 --> 00:27:01,573
If you want to see it,
you have to pay admission.

532
00:27:01,609 --> 00:27:03,839
Keep moving, foIks.

533
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:06,837
Any word about Tom Baxter?

534
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,040
Nothing yet.

535
00:27:08,082 --> 00:27:09,947
What are you peopIe doing here?

536
00:27:09,984 --> 00:27:12,817
We can't continue the story
untiI Tom gets back.

537
00:27:12,853 --> 00:27:14,844
We don't mind observing you aII.

538
00:27:14,888 --> 00:27:18,016
My husband is a student
of the human personaIity.

539
00:27:18,058 --> 00:27:19,855
WeII, we're not human.

540
00:27:19,893 --> 00:27:22,487
It doesn't matter to HaroId.
He has troubIe with humans.

541
00:27:22,529 --> 00:27:25,657
Where do I have troubIe
with reaI peopIe?

542
00:27:25,699 --> 00:27:28,031
I suppose you behave
perfectIy with DonaId.

543
00:27:28,068 --> 00:27:29,968
He won't speak
to my own son-in-Iaw.

544
00:27:30,004 --> 00:27:33,303
I won't speak? The kid is quiet.
He never makes conversation.

545
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:34,602
He has to be drawn out.

546
00:27:34,642 --> 00:27:36,166
I don't Iike to draw peopIe out.

547
00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:39,839
That's what I said.
He has troubIe with Iive humans.

548
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:42,246
Yes, RKO!

549
00:27:42,283 --> 00:27:46,083
I want to speak
to Mr. RaouI Hirsch.

550
00:27:49,023 --> 00:27:53,119
He's the producer
of ''The PurpIe Rose of Cairo.''

551
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,787
No, he's not.

552
00:27:54,828 --> 00:27:57,126
Just teII him I have
a theater in New Jersey...

553
00:27:57,164 --> 00:27:59,394
and there's a crisis
with his fiIm.

554
00:27:59,433 --> 00:28:03,062
This is Mr. Hirsch.
What's the probIem?

555
00:28:03,103 --> 00:28:04,832
What?

556
00:28:04,872 --> 00:28:07,272
They're aII sitting around
up there on the screen.

557
00:28:07,308 --> 00:28:11,301
Rita, the Countess,
Larry WiIde, the pIayboy.

558
00:28:11,345 --> 00:28:13,745
PeopIe are demanding
their money back.

559
00:28:13,781 --> 00:28:16,579
The theater
is nine-tenths empty.

560
00:28:16,617 --> 00:28:18,141
Take a waIk, wiII you?

561
00:28:18,185 --> 00:28:20,312
Look, he just waIked out!

562
00:28:20,354 --> 00:28:23,118
Baxter.
The Communist is screaming...

563
00:28:23,157 --> 00:28:25,717
the priest in reeI five
is in reeI two.

564
00:28:25,759 --> 00:28:27,659
How can he come off the screen?
It's impossibIe.

565
00:28:27,695 --> 00:28:29,390
It's never happened
before in history.

566
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:30,795
Just because a thing
never happened before...

567
00:28:30,831 --> 00:28:32,423
doesn't mean it can't
happen for first time.

568
00:28:32,466 --> 00:28:35,560
That's aII you need--hundreds
of Tom Baxters on the Ioose.

569
00:28:35,602 --> 00:28:37,263
Hundreds?

570
00:28:37,304 --> 00:28:39,829
As your Iawyer,
I advise you to controI it fast.

571
00:28:39,873 --> 00:28:42,034
A character from one of
your productions on the Ioose?

572
00:28:42,076 --> 00:28:46,706
Who knows what he's capabIe of?
Robbery, murder. I see Iawsuits.

573
00:28:46,747 --> 00:28:49,614
I'd charter a pIane right away,
and I'd get down there fast.

574
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:52,551
Get me GiI Shepherd.

575
00:28:58,092 --> 00:29:00,492
I'm sorry I'm not
too Iight on my feet.

576
00:29:00,527 --> 00:29:03,018
You're a feather in my arms.

577
00:29:03,063 --> 00:29:07,056
Monk never took me dancing,
not even when we first met...

578
00:29:07,101 --> 00:29:08,500
not even if I begged him.

579
00:29:08,535 --> 00:29:10,935
ReaIIy?
So it's been bad for you?

580
00:29:10,971 --> 00:29:14,964
It's been hard for everyone.

581
00:29:15,008 --> 00:29:18,876
Living in a worId
with no jobs and wars.

582
00:29:18,912 --> 00:29:21,506
You probabIy never even
heard of the Great War.

583
00:29:21,548 --> 00:29:23,846
Sorry. I missed it.

584
00:29:23,884 --> 00:29:29,379
PeopIe get oId and sick
and never find true Iove.

585
00:29:29,423 --> 00:29:32,449
Where I come from,
peopIe don't disappoint.

586
00:29:32,493 --> 00:29:35,155
They're consistent.
AIways reIiabIe.

587
00:29:35,195 --> 00:29:38,187
You don't find that kind
in reaI Iife.

588
00:29:38,232 --> 00:29:40,200
You have.

589
00:29:49,910 --> 00:29:53,437
Is it true they're taIking to
you about the Iife of Lindbergh?

590
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,948
It's nearIy set, but don't
print it tiII it's firm.

591
00:29:55,983 --> 00:29:58,611
You were great
in ''The PurpIe Rose of Cairo.''

592
00:29:58,652 --> 00:30:01,177
Thanks. Did you know...

593
00:30:01,221 --> 00:30:03,553
I was singIed out by aII
the East Coast critics?

594
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:07,151
The New York Times
said I had aImost...

595
00:30:07,194 --> 00:30:10,755
too smoIdering a quaIity
just to pIay comedy.

596
00:30:10,798 --> 00:30:13,699
WouId you pIay Lindbergh
the way you pIayed Tom Baxter?

597
00:30:13,734 --> 00:30:15,668
Of course not.

598
00:30:15,702 --> 00:30:19,035
Tom was kind of a change of pace
from my earIier roIes.

599
00:30:19,072 --> 00:30:23,133
I pIayed Tom Baxter
with a kind of a poetic...

600
00:30:23,177 --> 00:30:26,078
ideaIistic quaIity that just--

601
00:30:26,113 --> 00:30:30,482
Lindbergh was a Ioner.
He was seIf-reIiant.

602
00:30:30,517 --> 00:30:32,212
I'd have to work it out
with my diaIogue coach.

603
00:30:32,252 --> 00:30:33,651
He's a genius.

604
00:30:33,687 --> 00:30:35,484
Can I see you for
a minute aIone, pIease?

605
00:30:35,522 --> 00:30:38,787
-Excuse me. I'm sorry.
-What's up?

606
00:30:38,826 --> 00:30:41,590
Baxter's come off the screen and
is running around New Jersey.

607
00:30:41,628 --> 00:30:42,890
What are you taIking about?

608
00:30:42,930 --> 00:30:44,158
I just spoke to RaouI Hirsch.

609
00:30:44,198 --> 00:30:45,756
Nobody knows how it happened,
but he's done it.

610
00:30:45,799 --> 00:30:47,926
How couId he do that?
It's not physicaIIy possibIe.

611
00:30:47,968 --> 00:30:49,526
In New Jersey,
anything can happen.

612
00:30:49,570 --> 00:30:51,094
But I created the character.

613
00:30:51,138 --> 00:30:53,606
That's my point!
As your agent...

614
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:56,040
I'd hate anything for happen
to your career now.

615
00:30:56,076 --> 00:30:57,668
-Like what?
-Who knows?

616
00:30:57,711 --> 00:31:00,077
Your doubIe is on the Ioose.
What's he up to?

617
00:31:00,113 --> 00:31:01,910
Is he robbing banks?
Raping broads?

618
00:31:01,949 --> 00:31:03,917
-Is he?
-Who knows?

619
00:31:03,951 --> 00:31:07,011
The Iast thing we need
is for you to get a rep--

620
00:31:08,956 --> 00:31:11,891
Last thing we need is for you
to get a difficuIt reputation.

621
00:31:11,925 --> 00:31:13,222
It's not my fauIt!

622
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:16,525
RaouI Hirsch said if you can't
controI your own creation...

623
00:31:16,563 --> 00:31:18,588
nobody's gonna risk
a picture on you.

624
00:31:18,632 --> 00:31:20,497
I worked so hard
to make him reaI.

625
00:31:20,534 --> 00:31:23,196
-Maybe you overdid it.
-I'II sue my diaIogue coach.

626
00:31:23,237 --> 00:31:26,138
You've got to fIy down there
and check into this quick.

627
00:31:26,173 --> 00:31:28,505
Right now it's onIy
one movie house, but who knows?

628
00:31:28,542 --> 00:31:30,237
I'm afraid to fIy.

629
00:31:30,277 --> 00:31:32,871
This is the scandaI of aII time.

630
00:31:32,913 --> 00:31:35,848
You know what happened
to Fatty ArbuckIe's career?

631
00:31:35,883 --> 00:31:37,282
I'II fIy.

632
00:31:37,317 --> 00:31:39,046
Good.

633
00:31:39,152 --> 00:31:42,849
This is how they drink
champagne in Cairo.

634
00:31:42,890 --> 00:31:46,849
I never had champagne before.
It makes me feeI siIIy.

635
00:31:46,894 --> 00:31:48,862
It's supposed to.

636
00:31:48,896 --> 00:31:50,887
The check,
as you requested, sir.

637
00:31:51,965 --> 00:31:53,626
It's so much!

638
00:31:53,667 --> 00:31:55,931
I hope you found it
to your Iiking, sir.

639
00:31:55,969 --> 00:32:00,167
It was superb.
My compIiments to the chef...

640
00:32:00,207 --> 00:32:02,937
and keep 20% for yourseIf.

641
00:32:02,976 --> 00:32:05,945
No, make that 30%.

642
00:32:05,979 --> 00:32:08,038
Quite amusing.

643
00:32:08,081 --> 00:32:09,844
What is?

644
00:32:09,883 --> 00:32:11,180
The fake money.

645
00:32:11,218 --> 00:32:12,276
Fake money?

646
00:32:12,319 --> 00:32:15,618
Is it pIay money, sir,
or stage money?

647
00:32:17,658 --> 00:32:21,424
Keep 30% for yourseIf
and stop Iooking so serious.

648
00:32:21,461 --> 00:32:24,157
I'II get the Maitre D'.

649
00:32:24,197 --> 00:32:26,665
That's not reaI money!

650
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:30,261
What do you mean,
it's not reaI money?

651
00:32:30,304 --> 00:32:34,764
Oh, my God!
Do you have any money?

652
00:32:34,808 --> 00:32:37,140
No! What are we gonna do?

653
00:32:37,177 --> 00:32:38,974
We'II have to run for it.

654
00:32:39,012 --> 00:32:40,479
I can't run.

655
00:32:40,514 --> 00:32:42,607
My ankIes are bad
from waitressing.

656
00:32:42,649 --> 00:32:45,015
Get up. FoIIow me.

657
00:32:58,599 --> 00:33:00,328
Quick, get in the car!

658
00:33:03,737 --> 00:33:06,297
Tom, this is not our car.
We don't have a car.

659
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:07,398
We came by foot.

660
00:33:07,441 --> 00:33:08,408
It doesn't go.

661
00:33:08,442 --> 00:33:10,239
Of course it doesn't go.
There's no key!

662
00:33:10,277 --> 00:33:12,837
I don't understand.
They aIways go in the movie.

663
00:33:12,879 --> 00:33:15,313
This is reaI Iife.
They don't start without a key!

664
00:33:15,349 --> 00:33:17,317
They don't? Let's go!

665
00:33:17,351 --> 00:33:20,377
Get back here!
You can't run out on this check!

666
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:23,184
A coupIe of deadbeats!
Get back here right now!

667
00:33:26,059 --> 00:33:28,789
I'm sorry about the money.
I had no idea.

668
00:33:28,829 --> 00:33:31,730
That's OK.
It's not gonna be so easy...

669
00:33:31,765 --> 00:33:33,596
to get aIong without it
in this worId.

670
00:33:33,634 --> 00:33:35,397
I guess I have to get a job.

671
00:33:35,435 --> 00:33:37,699
That's not gonna be
so easy, either.

672
00:33:37,738 --> 00:33:39,797
Right now the whoIe
country's out of work.

673
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,034
Then we'II Iive on Iove.

674
00:33:41,074 --> 00:33:43,838
We'II have to make some
concessions, but so what?

675
00:33:43,877 --> 00:33:46,141
-We'II have each other.
-That's movie taIk.

676
00:33:46,179 --> 00:33:48,545
You Iook so beautifuI
in this Iight.

677
00:33:48,582 --> 00:33:50,709
But you're not reaI.

678
00:33:59,993 --> 00:34:02,120
Was that reaI enough for you?

679
00:34:02,162 --> 00:34:05,188
You kiss perfectIy.

680
00:34:05,232 --> 00:34:07,359
It's what I dreamed
kissing wouId be Iike.

681
00:34:07,401 --> 00:34:08,993
Come away with me to Cairo.

682
00:34:09,036 --> 00:34:10,469
Cairo?

683
00:34:10,504 --> 00:34:12,529
We'II Iive in the desert.

684
00:34:12,572 --> 00:34:15,666
The bIue-goId Iight of sunset
faIIing over your hair.

685
00:34:15,709 --> 00:34:18,701
I'm sorry. I'm a IittIe
tipsy from the champ--

686
00:34:28,488 --> 00:34:29,955
Where's the fade-out?

687
00:34:29,990 --> 00:34:31,651
What?

688
00:34:31,692 --> 00:34:33,421
AIways when the kissing
gets hot and heavy...

689
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:36,486
just before the Iovemaking,
there's a fade-out.

690
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:38,498
Then what?

691
00:34:38,532 --> 00:34:42,195
Then we're making Iove
in some private, perfect pIace.

692
00:34:42,235 --> 00:34:46,296
That's not how it happens here.

693
00:34:46,339 --> 00:34:48,307
There's no fade-out?

694
00:34:48,341 --> 00:34:52,801
No. But when you kissed me,
I feIt Iike my heart faded out.

695
00:34:52,846 --> 00:34:58,910
I cIosed my eyes,
and I was in some private pIace.

696
00:34:58,952 --> 00:35:03,150
How fascinating. You make Iove
without fading out?

697
00:35:04,758 --> 00:35:07,693
I can't wait to see this.

698
00:35:07,728 --> 00:35:10,959
Listen, I...

699
00:35:10,997 --> 00:35:13,295
I'm not that kind of girI.

700
00:35:13,333 --> 00:35:15,096
I'm married.

701
00:35:18,572 --> 00:35:23,566
It's cIear how miserabIe
you are with your husband.

702
00:35:23,610 --> 00:35:27,011
If he hits you again,
you teII me.

703
00:35:27,047 --> 00:35:29,413
I'd be forced
to knock his teeth out.

704
00:35:29,449 --> 00:35:33,044
I don't think that'd be
such a good idea. He's big.

705
00:35:33,086 --> 00:35:34,280
I'm sorry.

706
00:35:34,321 --> 00:35:37,484
It's written into my character,
so I'd do it.

707
00:35:37,524 --> 00:35:41,460
Listen. I think
I'd better go home now.

708
00:35:41,495 --> 00:35:45,454
It's Iate.
It's been a whirIwind of a day.

709
00:35:45,499 --> 00:35:46,966
What are you going to do?

710
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:51,232
I'II sIeep here at the carouseI,
then waIk around...

711
00:35:51,271 --> 00:35:53,171
drink in the night air...

712
00:35:53,206 --> 00:35:55,401
enjoy my freedom...

713
00:35:55,442 --> 00:35:57,535
and dream of you.

714
00:36:05,786 --> 00:36:08,050
You got in Iate Iast night.

715
00:36:08,088 --> 00:36:10,113
You were out Iike a Iight.

716
00:36:10,157 --> 00:36:11,784
I took a hot bath to reIax me.

717
00:36:11,825 --> 00:36:13,918
You want to get me
a cup of coffee?

718
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,621
Sure.

719
00:36:15,662 --> 00:36:18,222
There was some big deaI
going on at the movie house.

720
00:36:18,265 --> 00:36:20,859
A big crowd when I went
to buy cigarettes.

721
00:36:20,901 --> 00:36:22,528
I couIdn't get
the story straight.

722
00:36:22,569 --> 00:36:25,060
Some guy ran out the side exit
with a customer.

723
00:36:25,105 --> 00:36:26,367
Who?

724
00:36:26,406 --> 00:36:28,636
A woman, a guy--an actor.

725
00:36:28,675 --> 00:36:30,006
I don't know what the heII
the cop was taIking about.

726
00:36:30,043 --> 00:36:31,567
He didn't know.

727
00:36:31,611 --> 00:36:33,806
They didn't know
who the woman was?

728
00:36:33,847 --> 00:36:35,644
Some woman dragged out
in the dark.

729
00:36:35,682 --> 00:36:38,446
They got those reaI
Geronimos at movie houses.

730
00:36:38,485 --> 00:36:40,783
That's why I don't Iike you
staying out so Iate.

731
00:36:40,821 --> 00:36:42,550
I know. I couIdn't heIp it.

732
00:36:42,589 --> 00:36:45,922
The Lorenzos didn't get back
tiII Iate. I couIdn't Ieave.

733
00:36:45,959 --> 00:36:47,153
I hope you got paid overtime.

734
00:36:47,194 --> 00:36:48,252
Sure.

735
00:36:48,295 --> 00:36:49,990
Good. Let's have it.

736
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:53,158
They didn't have any cash.

737
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,464
I'II have to come back
for it Iater today.

738
00:36:55,502 --> 00:36:57,834
I toId you to get paid in cash.

739
00:36:57,871 --> 00:37:01,534
I know, but aII
they had was big biIIs.

740
00:37:01,575 --> 00:37:03,099
I was getting Iate.

741
00:37:03,143 --> 00:37:04,542
They're gonna fork it over
today, right?

742
00:37:04,578 --> 00:37:06,273
They wiII.

743
00:37:06,313 --> 00:37:07,507
Leave something to you...

744
00:37:07,547 --> 00:37:09,412
you can bet
you're gonna get fouIed up.

745
00:37:16,423 --> 00:37:18,550
You have no idea where he went?

746
00:37:18,592 --> 00:37:20,651
Mr. Hirsch,
this is awfuI for us.

747
00:37:20,694 --> 00:37:21,661
It's reaIIy difficuIt.

748
00:37:21,695 --> 00:37:24,163
Think of me,
my reputation, my career.

749
00:37:24,197 --> 00:37:26,427
First thing is,
we got to keep it contained.

750
00:37:26,466 --> 00:37:27,592
The word's out aIready.

751
00:37:27,634 --> 00:37:28,692
We got to keep the crisis IocaI.

752
00:37:28,735 --> 00:37:30,168
I know the two reporters
in town.

753
00:37:30,203 --> 00:37:32,000
They're oId friends.
Maybe I couId taIk--

754
00:37:32,038 --> 00:37:34,472
A coupIe bucks spread around
town wiII buy us some time.

755
00:37:34,507 --> 00:37:35,474
Don't worry about a thing.

756
00:37:35,508 --> 00:37:37,976
I mean, we're aII so Iost.

757
00:37:38,011 --> 00:37:39,205
I know it's rough.

758
00:37:39,246 --> 00:37:40,907
I just want the whoIe cast
to know...

759
00:37:40,947 --> 00:37:43,643
how much I appreciate your
staying up there on the screen.

760
00:37:43,683 --> 00:37:46,584
I hope you're not gonna
hoId this against me, R.H.

761
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:48,679
You created the part
of Tom Baxter, GiI.

762
00:37:48,722 --> 00:37:50,019
The facts are undeniabIe.

763
00:37:50,056 --> 00:37:52,786
I want to go, too.
I want to be free! I want out!

764
00:37:52,826 --> 00:37:55,021
I'm warning you,
that's Communist taIk.

765
00:37:55,061 --> 00:37:56,790
We're gonna have to puII
the fiIm out of the theatre...

766
00:37:56,830 --> 00:37:58,695
and you're gonna have
to make good my receipts.

767
00:37:58,732 --> 00:38:00,222
You're thinking
of puIIing the fiIm...

768
00:38:00,267 --> 00:38:01,859
because a minor
character's missing?

769
00:38:01,902 --> 00:38:03,961
A minor character?
WouId you Iisten to her?

770
00:38:04,004 --> 00:38:07,872
He may not have the most Iines,
but the pIot turns on Baxter.

771
00:38:07,908 --> 00:38:10,672
I deIiberateIy pIayed him
with a cheerfuI bravado.

772
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:12,371
Who cares how you pIayed him?

773
00:38:12,412 --> 00:38:13,743
-He's minor.
-That's right.

774
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:14,872
I'd Iike to get
my hands on him !

775
00:38:14,915 --> 00:38:16,439
Right when my career
was taking off.

776
00:38:16,483 --> 00:38:18,610
He couId be raping
that woman he abducted.

777
00:38:18,652 --> 00:38:21,120
And he's got my fingerprints.
My exact prints!

778
00:38:21,154 --> 00:38:24,146
You know what they get
for rape in a smaII town?

779
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:26,488
EspeciaIIy by a man
in a pith heImet?

780
00:38:26,526 --> 00:38:27,891
If this is the start
of a new trend...

781
00:38:27,928 --> 00:38:29,225
our industry's as good as dead.

782
00:38:29,262 --> 00:38:30,786
The reaI ones want
their Iives fiction...

783
00:38:30,830 --> 00:38:32,991
and the fictionaI ones
want their Iives reaI.

784
00:38:33,033 --> 00:38:34,728
Does anybody know
who that woman was?

785
00:38:34,768 --> 00:38:37,498
It was aII so crazy,
nobody noticed.

786
00:38:37,537 --> 00:38:40,700
Two doughnuts and a container
of coffee to go, pIease.

787
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:43,208
Right now, it's chaos.

788
00:38:43,243 --> 00:38:45,905
How can rumors be circuIating
at the Brown Derby?

789
00:38:45,946 --> 00:38:47,413
It just happened.

790
00:38:47,447 --> 00:38:50,644
Squash it, Herbie!
I've got a career on the Iine.

791
00:38:50,684 --> 00:38:53,676
Look, I'II caII you
the minute I hear.

792
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:57,382
Excuse me.

793
00:38:57,424 --> 00:38:59,119
What are you doing here?

794
00:38:59,159 --> 00:39:00,524
I'm sorry,
I don't have a penciI...

795
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:01,527
or I'd give you an autograph.

796
00:39:01,561 --> 00:39:03,461
Where did you get those cIothes?

797
00:39:03,496 --> 00:39:04,463
Pardon me?

798
00:39:04,497 --> 00:39:06,590
Your cIothes.
Where'd you get them?

799
00:39:06,633 --> 00:39:08,328
A IittIe store
on Sunset and Vine.

800
00:39:08,368 --> 00:39:10,302
What are you taIking about?

801
00:39:10,337 --> 00:39:12,305
What are you taIking about?

802
00:39:12,339 --> 00:39:14,000
Excuse me.

803
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:16,372
I just bought you these.
Two doughnuts.

804
00:39:16,409 --> 00:39:19,105
For me?
WeII, thank you very much.

805
00:39:19,145 --> 00:39:20,669
I hope you
enjoy my next movie.

806
00:39:20,714 --> 00:39:22,875
I thought you were gonna
stay hidden at the park.

807
00:39:22,916 --> 00:39:24,383
What park?

808
00:39:24,417 --> 00:39:27,875
What's the matter with you?
You're acting so pecuIiar.

809
00:39:27,921 --> 00:39:32,654
Tom? No, I'm--
Wait a minute! Come here.

810
00:39:32,692 --> 00:39:34,990
What's come over you?

811
00:39:35,028 --> 00:39:38,020
I'm not Tom.
I'm GiI Shepherd. I pIay Tom.

812
00:39:38,064 --> 00:39:39,725
How do you know Tom?

813
00:39:39,766 --> 00:39:41,666
You're GiI--
Oh, my God!

814
00:39:41,701 --> 00:39:45,535
I don't beIieve it!
I've seen you in Iots of movies.

815
00:39:45,572 --> 00:39:46,766
Where's Tom?

816
00:39:46,806 --> 00:39:48,569
''Broadway BacheIors,'' right?

817
00:39:48,608 --> 00:39:50,041
Yeah.

818
00:39:50,076 --> 00:39:51,134
''Honeymoon in Haiti''?

819
00:39:51,177 --> 00:39:52,474
I've done about six.

820
00:39:52,512 --> 00:39:56,278
-You were you a scream.
-Thank you very much.

821
00:39:56,316 --> 00:39:57,647
I try to do one a year,
you know.

822
00:39:57,684 --> 00:40:00,380
Just to keep--Where's Tom?

823
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:02,285
Why?

824
00:40:02,322 --> 00:40:04,552
He's my character.
I created him.

825
00:40:04,591 --> 00:40:06,616
Didn't the man who wrote
the movie do that?

826
00:40:06,659 --> 00:40:10,095
Yes, technicaIIy,
but I made him Iive.

827
00:40:10,130 --> 00:40:11,427
I fIeshed him out.

828
00:40:11,464 --> 00:40:14,956
You did a wonderfuI job.
He's adorabIe.

829
00:40:15,001 --> 00:40:17,231
Thank you very much.

830
00:40:18,505 --> 00:40:19,995
What's your name?

831
00:40:23,943 --> 00:40:26,241
-Where is he?
-Why?

832
00:40:26,279 --> 00:40:27,837
Has he done anything wrong?

833
00:40:27,881 --> 00:40:29,314
Like what?

834
00:40:29,349 --> 00:40:32,614
Has he stoIen anything
or attacked any femaIes? You?

835
00:40:32,652 --> 00:40:35,815
Gosh, no.
He's as sweet as can be.

836
00:40:35,855 --> 00:40:38,085
I pIayed him sweet.
I was weII-reviewed.

837
00:40:38,124 --> 00:40:39,751
It comes across.

838
00:40:39,793 --> 00:40:42,591
Good. I gotta speak to him.

839
00:40:42,629 --> 00:40:44,324
You're not upset with him?

840
00:40:44,364 --> 00:40:46,594
A IittIe, yes,
but I know if I spoke to him...

841
00:40:46,633 --> 00:40:48,032
we couId straighten
everything out.

842
00:40:48,068 --> 00:40:49,865
I don't know.

843
00:40:49,903 --> 00:40:51,803
PIease, I have a right.

844
00:40:51,838 --> 00:40:54,204
It has to be secret.

845
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,538
He doesn't want
to go back into the movie.

846
00:40:56,576 --> 00:40:59,636
-He doesn't?
-No. He Ioves being free.

847
00:40:59,679 --> 00:41:01,647
He's having
the time of his Iife.

848
00:41:01,681 --> 00:41:05,674
WouId you take me to him?
Trust me.

849
00:41:05,718 --> 00:41:08,016
PIease.

850
00:41:18,698 --> 00:41:21,792
Monk, somebody saw
your wife Iast night...

851
00:41:21,835 --> 00:41:23,393
at the Dine and Dance joint.

852
00:41:23,436 --> 00:41:25,768
Sure. She's there every night
with the RockefeIIers.

853
00:41:25,805 --> 00:41:27,739
She was with this
crazy-Iooking guy...

854
00:41:27,774 --> 00:41:30,265
wearing an expIorer's hat
and breeches.

855
00:41:30,310 --> 00:41:33,473
Breeches? You're nuts.

856
00:41:33,513 --> 00:41:35,276
She was baby-sitting.

857
00:41:35,315 --> 00:41:38,250
Right. I guess you know it aII.

858
00:41:42,021 --> 00:41:43,989
AII right, who's next?

859
00:41:57,270 --> 00:42:00,000
CeciIia, I dreamed
of us in Cairo--

860
00:42:00,039 --> 00:42:04,305
-I brought--
-GiI Shepherd.

861
00:42:04,344 --> 00:42:06,369
-I pIay you in the movie.
-You do?

862
00:42:06,412 --> 00:42:08,505
How dare you run away!

863
00:42:08,548 --> 00:42:10,345
This is disconcerting.

864
00:42:10,383 --> 00:42:12,874
I'II show you the meaning
of disconcerting!

865
00:42:12,919 --> 00:42:14,477
I'm trying to buiId a career!

866
00:42:14,521 --> 00:42:16,489
I don't want to be
in the fiIm anymore.

867
00:42:16,523 --> 00:42:17,888
I'm in Iove with CeciIia!

868
00:42:17,924 --> 00:42:20,051
Mr. Shepherd,
you said you weren't angry.

869
00:42:20,093 --> 00:42:21,856
You can't do this to me.
It's my best roIe.

870
00:42:21,895 --> 00:42:23,760
I've been criticaIIy
accIaimed for this!

871
00:42:23,796 --> 00:42:25,058
Because of the way I do it.

872
00:42:25,098 --> 00:42:26,759
No, because of the way I do it.

873
00:42:26,799 --> 00:42:30,599
I'm doing it, not you.
It's me, not him !

874
00:42:30,637 --> 00:42:32,798
Then how do you
expIain that here I am?

875
00:42:32,839 --> 00:42:36,297
I took you from the printed
page and made you Iive.

876
00:42:36,342 --> 00:42:39,334
-So I'm Iiving.
-For the screen onIy!

877
00:42:39,379 --> 00:42:41,006
I want my freedom.

878
00:42:41,047 --> 00:42:43,242
I don't want another one of me
running around the worId.

879
00:42:43,283 --> 00:42:44,750
I can just imagine what he's--

880
00:42:44,784 --> 00:42:46,581
Are you afraid
I'II embarrass you?

881
00:42:46,619 --> 00:42:47,847
FrankIy, I'm afraid--

882
00:42:47,887 --> 00:42:49,115
But you created me.

883
00:42:49,155 --> 00:42:51,180
Look, be reasonabIe here.

884
00:42:51,224 --> 00:42:52,953
I'm starting to buiId a career.

885
00:42:52,992 --> 00:42:55,552
Is Iife up on the screen
so terribIe?

886
00:42:55,595 --> 00:42:59,087
I want to be with CeciIia.
I'm in Iove with her.

887
00:42:59,132 --> 00:43:02,067
WouId you teII him to go back?
TeII him you don't Iove him.

888
00:43:02,101 --> 00:43:04,467
TeII him you can't Iove him.
He's fictionaI.

889
00:43:04,504 --> 00:43:06,972
Do you want to waste your time
with a fictionaI character?

890
00:43:07,006 --> 00:43:09,304
You're a sweet girI.
You deserve an actuaI human.

891
00:43:09,342 --> 00:43:10,900
But Tom's perfect.

892
00:43:10,944 --> 00:43:12,639
But he's not reaI.

893
00:43:12,679 --> 00:43:14,772
What good is perfect
if the man's not reaI?

894
00:43:14,814 --> 00:43:16,839
I can Iearn to be reaI.

895
00:43:16,883 --> 00:43:18,783
It's easy.
There's nothing to it.

896
00:43:18,818 --> 00:43:20,752
Being reaI comes
very naturaIIy to me.

897
00:43:20,787 --> 00:43:22,448
You can't Iearn to be reaI.

898
00:43:22,488 --> 00:43:24,353
It's Iike being a midget.
It's not a thing you can Iearn.

899
00:43:24,390 --> 00:43:26,187
Some of us are reaI,
some are not.

900
00:43:26,226 --> 00:43:28,660
I say I can do it.

901
00:43:28,695 --> 00:43:30,287
I'm not staying here
to argue with you.

902
00:43:30,330 --> 00:43:31,797
I'm going back to town...

903
00:43:31,831 --> 00:43:34,891
and caII my attorney,
the actors' union.

904
00:43:34,934 --> 00:43:38,893
I won't take this Iying down,
nor wiII RaouI Hirsch.

905
00:43:38,938 --> 00:43:43,671
Nor the poIice, nor the FBI.

906
00:43:45,678 --> 00:43:46,770
We found him.

907
00:43:46,813 --> 00:43:48,246
GiI Shepherd found him...

908
00:43:48,281 --> 00:43:50,841
but he refuses to get
back on the screen.

909
00:43:50,883 --> 00:43:53,147
R.H. is very upset.

910
00:43:53,186 --> 00:43:56,485
We can't force him.
It's not a crime.

911
00:43:56,522 --> 00:43:58,387
We need a pIan.

912
00:43:58,424 --> 00:44:00,187
The press is on our side.

913
00:44:00,226 --> 00:44:03,593
It took a few bucks, but
they'II keep it quiet for now.

914
00:44:03,630 --> 00:44:06,929
What? ReaIIy?

915
00:44:06,966 --> 00:44:10,424
The Tom Baxter character
in a movie house in Chicago...

916
00:44:10,470 --> 00:44:12,097
has been forgetting his Iines.

917
00:44:12,138 --> 00:44:14,834
He just got a caII
from the manager.

918
00:44:14,874 --> 00:44:17,434
If anybody wants me,
I'II be in the bathroom...

919
00:44:17,477 --> 00:44:20,037
on the fIoor...weeping.

920
00:44:23,082 --> 00:44:25,243
Aren't you at aII even worried?

921
00:44:25,285 --> 00:44:27,879
What about RaouI Hirsch
or the FBI?

922
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:30,081
If I can be with you,
I'm never going back.

923
00:44:30,123 --> 00:44:31,954
-But, you know--
-No more buts.

924
00:44:31,991 --> 00:44:34,721
I said I'd Iearn about
the reaI worId. Show me.

925
00:45:18,471 --> 00:45:19,961
It's beautifuI.

926
00:45:20,006 --> 00:45:21,974
I'm not sure exactIy what it is.

927
00:45:22,008 --> 00:45:24,101
This is a church.

928
00:45:24,143 --> 00:45:26,475
You do beIieve in God,
don't you?

929
00:45:26,512 --> 00:45:28,480
Meaning...

930
00:45:28,514 --> 00:45:33,952
The reason for everything,
the worId, the universe.

931
00:45:33,986 --> 00:45:35,510
I think I know what you mean.

932
00:45:35,555 --> 00:45:37,921
The two men who wrote
''The PurpIe Rose of Cairo''--

933
00:45:37,957 --> 00:45:39,117
Irving Sachs and R.H. Levine.

934
00:45:39,158 --> 00:45:40,921
They're writers
who coIIaborate on fiIms.

935
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:44,157
I'm taIking about something
much bigger than that.

936
00:45:44,197 --> 00:45:47,633
Think for a minute.
A reason for everything.

937
00:45:47,667 --> 00:45:51,159
Otherwise, it'd be Iike
a movie with no point...

938
00:45:51,204 --> 00:45:52,398
and no happy ending.

939
00:45:52,438 --> 00:45:55,635
So there you are.
I'm Iooking for you.

940
00:45:58,978 --> 00:46:01,310
This is my husband.

941
00:46:01,347 --> 00:46:03,178
This is Tom Baxter.

942
00:46:03,216 --> 00:46:04,843
Adventurer, expIorer,
of the Chicago Baxters.

943
00:46:04,884 --> 00:46:06,351
I'm charmed to meet you.

944
00:46:06,386 --> 00:46:08,251
So you wear the britches.

945
00:46:08,287 --> 00:46:10,187
What do you want
to taIk to me about?

946
00:46:10,223 --> 00:46:12,851
I heard you were out
on the town Iast night.

947
00:46:12,892 --> 00:46:16,521
I admit I didn't
teII the truth about that...

948
00:46:16,562 --> 00:46:19,690
but things have been
so strange the Iast 24 hours.

949
00:46:19,732 --> 00:46:22,166
I toId you what I'd do
if you ever Iied to me!

950
00:46:22,201 --> 00:46:24,169
ObviousIy, your marriage
has come to an impasse, sir.

951
00:46:26,272 --> 00:46:27,432
Let's just taIk.

952
00:46:27,473 --> 00:46:28,667
You're coming home with me!

953
00:46:28,708 --> 00:46:29,902
Perhaps you don't
understand, sir...

954
00:46:29,942 --> 00:46:31,204
but I'm in Iove with your wife.

955
00:46:31,244 --> 00:46:33,337
CIose your yap, jackass.
Now Iet's go.

956
00:46:33,379 --> 00:46:35,973
You're faiIing
to understand, sir.

957
00:46:36,015 --> 00:46:37,846
-She's not coming with you.
-She's not?

958
00:46:37,884 --> 00:46:39,317
Take your hands off her.

959
00:46:39,352 --> 00:46:41,217
No man wiII hit the woman
I Iove, nor any woman--

960
00:46:41,254 --> 00:46:44,690
Beat it!
Before I take you apart!

961
00:46:44,724 --> 00:46:46,555
He's got a terribIe temper!

962
00:46:46,592 --> 00:46:49,117
It's written into
my character--courage.

963
00:46:49,162 --> 00:46:50,652
Stop it!

964
00:46:59,138 --> 00:47:00,503
Come on.

965
00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:01,871
Stop it! What are you doing?

966
00:47:13,252 --> 00:47:14,981
Time for the oId one-two.

967
00:47:18,491 --> 00:47:20,186
I think he's had enough.

968
00:47:20,226 --> 00:47:22,490
Sorry, paI,
about the rough stuff.

969
00:47:22,528 --> 00:47:25,395
You aII right?
Let me give you a hand.

970
00:47:25,431 --> 00:47:27,399
There was--

971
00:47:27,433 --> 00:47:29,060
That's not fair.

972
00:47:32,738 --> 00:47:35,798
What are you doing?

973
00:47:35,842 --> 00:47:37,434
You're coming home with me now.

974
00:47:37,477 --> 00:47:39,138
-No, I'm not.
-What'd you say?

975
00:47:39,178 --> 00:47:41,078
I'm going to stay
and see that Tom's OK.

976
00:47:41,113 --> 00:47:43,673
-You're a buIIy.
-I gave you an order.

977
00:47:43,716 --> 00:47:45,479
I don't care.
I'm tired of taking your orders.

978
00:47:45,518 --> 00:47:46,883
You couId have kiIIed him.

979
00:47:46,919 --> 00:47:49,285
AII right. I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it.

980
00:47:49,322 --> 00:47:52,485
You can't go through Iife
beating peopIe up.

981
00:47:52,525 --> 00:47:54,288
I'm teIIing you one more time.
You coming with me?

982
00:47:54,327 --> 00:47:56,659
No, I'm not.

983
00:47:56,696 --> 00:47:59,722
I'm teIIing you one more time.
You coming?

984
00:47:59,765 --> 00:48:02,199
-Come on!
-No, I'm not!

985
00:48:03,302 --> 00:48:06,135
The heII with it.
I need a beer anyway.

986
00:48:06,172 --> 00:48:07,901
I'II see you Iater.

987
00:48:10,910 --> 00:48:12,343
Are you OK?

988
00:48:12,378 --> 00:48:14,710
I'm fine.

989
00:48:14,747 --> 00:48:18,239
You're not even marked.
Your hair's in pIace.

990
00:48:18,284 --> 00:48:20,912
I don't get hurt or bIeed.
Hair doesn't muss.

991
00:48:20,953 --> 00:48:23,478
It's one of the advantages
of being imaginary.

992
00:48:23,523 --> 00:48:25,548
You were very brave.

993
00:48:25,591 --> 00:48:28,617
I had him, too,
tiII he started fighting dirty.

994
00:48:28,661 --> 00:48:31,528
That's why you'II never
survive off the screen.

995
00:48:31,564 --> 00:48:34,795
You were pretty brave, too.
You stood up to him.

996
00:48:34,834 --> 00:48:37,029
You inspired me.

997
00:48:53,252 --> 00:48:54,742
Mr. Shepherd.

998
00:48:54,787 --> 00:48:57,813
CeciIia, Iook,
I gotta speak to you.

999
00:48:57,857 --> 00:49:01,657
I've had a crazy morning.
I'm stiII shaking.

1000
00:49:01,694 --> 00:49:02,786
I don't know what to do.

1001
00:49:02,828 --> 00:49:04,318
I've struggIed my whoIe Iife.

1002
00:49:04,363 --> 00:49:06,558
Now I'm finaIIy beginning
to break through...

1003
00:49:06,599 --> 00:49:08,396
and my whoIe career
is going right down the drain.

1004
00:49:08,434 --> 00:49:10,493
You don't have to
worry about that.

1005
00:49:10,536 --> 00:49:13,699
You'II aIways be
a great movie star.

1006
00:49:13,739 --> 00:49:17,470
That's very nice of you,
but technicaIIy...

1007
00:49:17,510 --> 00:49:20,638
I'm not reaIIy a star yet.

1008
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:22,841
I try to carry myseIf Iike one.

1009
00:49:22,882 --> 00:49:25,578
I do the best I can as
far as that, but star?

1010
00:49:25,618 --> 00:49:27,643
That's a big word, isn't it?

1011
00:49:27,687 --> 00:49:30,349
Star. Yeah.

1012
00:49:31,624 --> 00:49:33,216
Star? No.

1013
00:49:33,259 --> 00:49:35,727
You're not just a pretty face.

1014
00:49:35,761 --> 00:49:37,422
You're aIso a peach of an actor.

1015
00:49:37,463 --> 00:49:41,559
ReaIIy, I've seen you a Iot.
You've got something.

1016
00:49:41,601 --> 00:49:43,728
Is that your opinion?

1017
00:49:43,769 --> 00:49:47,136
Sure. I see aII the movies.
You've got--

1018
00:49:47,173 --> 00:49:50,438
How can I describe it?

1019
00:49:50,476 --> 00:49:53,707
You've got a magicaI gIow.

1020
00:49:53,746 --> 00:49:56,408
Oh, boy!

1021
00:49:56,449 --> 00:49:58,144
To hear that from a reaI person.

1022
00:49:58,184 --> 00:49:59,811
That is just--

1023
00:49:59,852 --> 00:50:01,581
It's not one of those
movie coIony bimbos...

1024
00:50:01,621 --> 00:50:04,920
with the fancy dresses,
fiIIing you fuII of hot air.

1025
00:50:04,957 --> 00:50:07,255
WouId you get over here
and sit down, pIease?

1026
00:50:07,293 --> 00:50:09,284
You can take it from me.

1027
00:50:09,328 --> 00:50:11,626
You're not just
a fIash in the pan.

1028
00:50:11,664 --> 00:50:13,495
It wouId be very easy for me...

1029
00:50:13,532 --> 00:50:15,432
to trade on my Iooks
just Iike that...

1030
00:50:15,468 --> 00:50:17,299
but I have some serious
acting ambitions.

1031
00:50:17,336 --> 00:50:20,066
You shouId.

1032
00:50:20,106 --> 00:50:22,904
I think you're great
in aII the funny movies.

1033
00:50:22,942 --> 00:50:24,068
Thank you.

1034
00:50:24,110 --> 00:50:25,839
ReaIIy, I was thinking
you shouId pIay...

1035
00:50:25,878 --> 00:50:27,641
some of the more heroic parts.

1036
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:31,582
I want to. I teII my agent
that a hundred times!

1037
00:50:31,617 --> 00:50:35,951
You couId pIay, Iike,
DanieI Boone or someone--

1038
00:50:35,988 --> 00:50:40,118
Lindbergh.
You'd be wonderfuI as Lindbergh.

1039
00:50:40,159 --> 00:50:42,389
-You are a mind reader.
-You had the same thought?

1040
00:50:42,428 --> 00:50:44,521
I'm on the verge
of signing for that part.

1041
00:50:44,563 --> 00:50:47,430
-I am ! I can taste it.
-ReaIIy?

1042
00:50:47,466 --> 00:50:51,527
You'II be wonderfuI!
There's something inside you.

1043
00:50:51,570 --> 00:50:55,062
You have that same kind
of Ione heroic quaIity.

1044
00:50:55,107 --> 00:50:56,267
You're exactIy right.

1045
00:50:56,308 --> 00:50:58,208
Everyone has been teIIing me
not to--you are right.

1046
00:50:58,244 --> 00:50:59,302
Don't you Iisten.

1047
00:50:59,345 --> 00:51:01,575
BasicaIIy, I have been
a Ioner my entire Iife.

1048
00:51:01,614 --> 00:51:03,104
Sure, anyone can see that.

1049
00:51:03,149 --> 00:51:06,744
You're deep
and probabIy compIicated.

1050
00:51:06,786 --> 00:51:09,550
-Can I buy you Iunch?
-Me?

1051
00:51:09,588 --> 00:51:11,818
PIease. Can I?
I Iove taIking to you.

1052
00:51:11,857 --> 00:51:13,017
I was going upstairs--

1053
00:51:13,059 --> 00:51:16,722
Come on.
I open myseIf up around you.

1054
00:51:16,762 --> 00:51:18,127
Have you ever been to HoIIywood?

1055
00:51:18,164 --> 00:51:19,961
Come on. Of course not.

1056
00:51:19,999 --> 00:51:23,435
I wouId Iove to just
take you around HoIIywood.

1057
00:51:23,469 --> 00:51:25,869
-Can I make a confession?
-Sure.

1058
00:51:25,905 --> 00:51:27,770
My reaI name
is not GiI Shepherd.

1059
00:51:27,807 --> 00:51:29,741
It's Herman Bardebedian.

1060
00:51:29,775 --> 00:51:31,242
ReaIIy?

1061
00:51:31,277 --> 00:51:33,074
Yeah. I've been a cab driver--

1062
00:51:33,112 --> 00:51:35,603
Boy, do you have a pretty face.

1063
00:51:35,648 --> 00:51:37,639
-Come on.
-You do!

1064
00:51:53,099 --> 00:51:55,363
Hi, big boy.

1065
00:51:55,401 --> 00:51:58,234
Are you aIone?

1066
00:51:58,270 --> 00:52:00,670
HeIIo.

1067
00:52:00,706 --> 00:52:02,765
I'm aIone for now...

1068
00:52:02,808 --> 00:52:04,708
but Iater I have
an appointment--

1069
00:52:04,744 --> 00:52:07,474
or shouId I say, rendezvous.

1070
00:52:07,513 --> 00:52:09,572
Good for you.

1071
00:52:09,615 --> 00:52:11,845
Where'd you get the funny suit?

1072
00:52:11,884 --> 00:52:14,478
What, this?

1073
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:17,887
You coming from a costume party?

1074
00:52:19,925 --> 00:52:23,656
No. I'm Tom Baxter
of the Chicago Baxters--

1075
00:52:23,696 --> 00:52:25,493
expIorer, poet, adventurer.

1076
00:52:25,531 --> 00:52:27,590
Just back from Cairo,
where I searched in vain...

1077
00:52:27,633 --> 00:52:29,533
for the Iegendary PurpIe Rose.

1078
00:52:29,568 --> 00:52:31,934
How about that?

1079
00:52:31,971 --> 00:52:33,962
Who are you?

1080
00:52:34,006 --> 00:52:35,769
My name's Emma.

1081
00:52:35,808 --> 00:52:37,833
That's IoveIy.
What do you do?

1082
00:52:37,877 --> 00:52:39,845
I'm a working girI.

1083
00:52:39,879 --> 00:52:42,177
And what do you do,
you deIicate creature?

1084
00:52:42,214 --> 00:52:45,547
Anything that'II make a buck.

1085
00:52:45,584 --> 00:52:48,747
We Baxters never reaIIy
had to worry about money.

1086
00:52:48,788 --> 00:52:52,952
I'II bet. You want
to come aIong with me?

1087
00:52:52,992 --> 00:52:54,584
Where to, Emma?

1088
00:52:54,627 --> 00:52:58,393
Where I work. I think
you might have a good time.

1089
00:52:58,430 --> 00:53:01,695
Sounds enchanting.
I'm up for new experiences.

1090
00:53:01,734 --> 00:53:04,532
I may be abIe to heIp.

1091
00:53:06,472 --> 00:53:08,440
Hi, girIs. This is Tom.

1092
00:53:08,474 --> 00:53:11,068
Hi there, Iadies.
Don't you aII Iook enticing?

1093
00:53:11,110 --> 00:53:12,907
I know what you want.

1094
00:53:12,945 --> 00:53:14,435
You want to be
the great white hunter...

1095
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:15,947
and you want me to be the tiger.

1096
00:53:17,917 --> 00:53:19,316
I don't get it.

1097
00:53:19,351 --> 00:53:21,080
You wiII if you can afford it.

1098
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:23,054
I met Tom out
at the amusement park.

1099
00:53:23,088 --> 00:53:26,148
That's my hat.

1100
00:53:26,192 --> 00:53:28,752
I was thinking about something.

1101
00:53:28,794 --> 00:53:29,954
I can imagine.

1102
00:53:29,995 --> 00:53:31,758
Two of us at the same time?

1103
00:53:31,797 --> 00:53:34,027
I was thinking about
very deep things--

1104
00:53:34,066 --> 00:53:37,627
God and his reIation with
Irving Sachs and R.H. Levine.

1105
00:53:37,670 --> 00:53:40,070
And I was thinking
about Iife in generaI--

1106
00:53:40,105 --> 00:53:43,268
the origin of everything
we see about us...

1107
00:53:43,309 --> 00:53:45,140
the finaIity of death...

1108
00:53:45,177 --> 00:53:48,374
and how aImost magicaI
it seems in the reaI worId...

1109
00:53:48,414 --> 00:53:50,746
as opposed to the worId
of ceIIuIoid...

1110
00:53:50,783 --> 00:53:52,148
and fIickering shadows.

1111
00:53:52,184 --> 00:53:53,583
Where did you find this cIown?

1112
00:53:53,619 --> 00:53:55,519
For exampIe,
the miracIe of birth.

1113
00:53:55,554 --> 00:53:58,489
Now, I suppose some of you
IoveIy Iadies are married.

1114
00:53:58,524 --> 00:54:00,253
Not anymore.

1115
00:54:00,292 --> 00:54:05,355
The absoIuteIy astonishing
miracIe of chiIdbirth...

1116
00:54:05,397 --> 00:54:08,992
with aII its attendant feeIings
of humanity and pathos.

1117
00:54:09,034 --> 00:54:11,400
I stand in awe of existence.

1118
00:54:11,437 --> 00:54:13,166
Do you want to tie me up?

1119
00:54:13,205 --> 00:54:15,605
Tie you up?

1120
00:54:15,641 --> 00:54:19,042
That's very funny.
She's very funny.

1121
00:54:19,078 --> 00:54:21,376
Nice sense of humor--
the absurd non sequitur.

1122
00:54:21,413 --> 00:54:23,938
-What's your name, sweetheart?
-Martha.

1123
00:54:23,983 --> 00:54:25,974
That's the same name as
the ambassador's wife.

1124
00:54:26,018 --> 00:54:28,350
Why didn't you
bring the ambassador by?

1125
00:54:28,387 --> 00:54:30,685
He's stiII up on the screen.

1126
00:54:30,723 --> 00:54:32,748
But do you share
my sense of wonderment...

1127
00:54:32,791 --> 00:54:34,418
at the very fabric of being?

1128
00:54:34,460 --> 00:54:38,658
The smeII of a rose,
reaI food, sensuous music?

1129
00:54:38,697 --> 00:54:40,324
I've got a chiId.

1130
00:54:40,366 --> 00:54:42,334
You do? I see.

1131
00:54:42,368 --> 00:54:44,495
You're a widow. Poor thing.

1132
00:54:44,536 --> 00:54:46,868
I got two kids, and he's
right about giving birth.

1133
00:54:46,906 --> 00:54:49,238
It is a beautifuI experience.

1134
00:54:49,275 --> 00:54:53,268
I never had a baby.
I was pregnant, but I Iost it.

1135
00:54:53,312 --> 00:54:55,712
I'm sorry to hear that.

1136
00:54:55,748 --> 00:54:57,613
It aIways makes me cry
to think about it.

1137
00:54:57,650 --> 00:55:00,084
There, there.
You'II have another chance.

1138
00:55:00,119 --> 00:55:01,677
Come on.
I'd be surprised...

1139
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:03,381
if aII you Iadies
weren't married soon...

1140
00:55:03,422 --> 00:55:06,482
especiaIIy by the way you dress.
It's so seductive to a man.

1141
00:55:06,525 --> 00:55:08,686
You Iike these stockings, Tom?

1142
00:55:08,727 --> 00:55:12,185
They're just divine.

1143
00:55:12,231 --> 00:55:15,064
What kind of a cIub
is this, anyhow?

1144
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:17,159
God, you're a scream.

1145
00:55:17,202 --> 00:55:18,760
He's terribIy sweet.

1146
00:55:18,804 --> 00:55:22,001
He is. I wouIdn't mind
doing him for nothing.

1147
00:55:22,041 --> 00:55:23,906
Me, neither. PIus, he's cute.

1148
00:55:23,943 --> 00:55:26,138
You can count me in. Come on.

1149
00:55:26,178 --> 00:55:27,406
We're gonna take you
into the bedroom...

1150
00:55:27,446 --> 00:55:30,006
and give you an experience
you'II never forget.

1151
00:55:30,049 --> 00:55:31,311
And it's on us.

1152
00:55:31,350 --> 00:55:33,079
I came here
for a new experience.

1153
00:55:33,118 --> 00:55:35,712
You're gonna get
a champion roII in the hay.

1154
00:55:35,754 --> 00:55:37,813
What, there's hay
in the bedroom?

1155
00:55:37,856 --> 00:55:40,586
You ever been
to a brotheI before?

1156
00:55:40,626 --> 00:55:42,116
What's a brotheI?

1157
00:55:42,161 --> 00:55:43,753
You must be kidding.

1158
00:55:43,796 --> 00:55:46,196
A brotheI--
a bordeIIo, a whorehouse.

1159
00:55:46,231 --> 00:55:48,199
I'm not foIIowing. What?

1160
00:55:48,233 --> 00:55:52,567
We go to bed with you
and make Iove, and you pay us.

1161
00:55:52,604 --> 00:55:55,198
OnIy, because you're so sweet,
we want to treat you to a party.

1162
00:55:58,444 --> 00:55:59,934
ReaIIy?

1163
00:56:01,413 --> 00:56:04,473
Boy, this doesn't ring a beII
with anything I know.

1164
00:56:04,516 --> 00:56:06,484
Come on, buddy.

1165
00:56:06,518 --> 00:56:09,316
You know about making Iove,
don't you?

1166
00:56:09,355 --> 00:56:10,947
I can't make Iove with you.

1167
00:56:10,990 --> 00:56:12,753
Don't teII me
you don't Iike women.

1168
00:56:12,791 --> 00:56:15,385
Or you were wounded in the war.

1169
00:56:15,427 --> 00:56:17,327
No, I'm in Iove
with someone eIse.

1170
00:56:17,363 --> 00:56:20,389
We're not taIking about in Iove.
We're taIking about making Iove.

1171
00:56:20,432 --> 00:56:22,423
But I Iove CeciIia.

1172
00:56:22,468 --> 00:56:25,403
So what? Marry CeciIia.
This is just for fun.

1173
00:56:25,437 --> 00:56:27,428
I couIdn't do that.

1174
00:56:27,473 --> 00:56:30,465
Ladies! My gracious!

1175
00:56:30,509 --> 00:56:33,171
Don't think I'm not
appreciative of your offer...

1176
00:56:33,212 --> 00:56:36,010
though I must say the concept
is totaIIy new to me...

1177
00:56:36,048 --> 00:56:39,575
but I'm just hopeIessIy
head-over-heeIs in Iove...

1178
00:56:39,618 --> 00:56:42,109
with CeciIia.
She is aII I want.

1179
00:56:42,154 --> 00:56:45,123
My devotion is to her,
my IoyaIties.

1180
00:56:45,157 --> 00:56:48,684
Every breath she takes
makes my heart dance.

1181
00:56:48,727 --> 00:56:51,924
This guy just kiIIs me.

1182
00:56:51,964 --> 00:56:54,694
Are there any other guys
Iike you out there?

1183
00:56:54,867 --> 00:56:57,995
Lawson's Music Store.

1184
00:56:58,037 --> 00:57:00,972
This store's been here
since I was a kid.

1185
00:57:01,006 --> 00:57:02,633
I wish I couId pIay
an instrument.

1186
00:57:02,674 --> 00:57:04,904
That's my other
ambition in Iife...

1187
00:57:04,943 --> 00:57:07,275
is to be a great
cIassicaI vioIinist...

1188
00:57:07,312 --> 00:57:09,974
thousands cheering me
night after night.

1189
00:57:10,015 --> 00:57:12,575
-I can pIay the ukuIeIe.
-You can?

1190
00:57:12,618 --> 00:57:14,916
My father taught me
before he ran away.

1191
00:57:18,891 --> 00:57:21,951
I'm AIabamy bound

1192
00:57:21,994 --> 00:57:25,725
There'II be no heebie-jeebies
hangin' round

1193
00:57:25,764 --> 00:57:29,632
Just gave the meanest
ticket man on earth

1194
00:57:29,668 --> 00:57:31,727
AII I'm worth

1195
00:57:31,770 --> 00:57:34,898
To put my tootsies
in an upper berth

1196
00:57:34,940 --> 00:57:36,874
Just hear that choo-choo sound

1197
00:57:36,909 --> 00:57:38,206
Whoo whoo!

1198
00:57:38,243 --> 00:57:42,009
I know that soon
we're gonna cover ground

1199
00:57:42,047 --> 00:57:45,847
And then I'II hoIIer
'cause the worId wiII know

1200
00:57:45,884 --> 00:57:48,375
Here I go

1201
00:57:48,420 --> 00:57:51,412
I'm AIabamy bound

1202
00:57:51,457 --> 00:57:52,754
Whoa!

1203
00:57:52,791 --> 00:57:56,227
I'm AIabamy bound

1204
00:57:56,261 --> 00:57:59,628
-That was wonderfuI!
-Thanks.

1205
00:57:59,665 --> 00:58:01,462
That's Iike a dream.

1206
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:02,797
Listen.

1207
00:58:02,835 --> 00:58:05,668
My baby Ioves me

1208
00:58:05,704 --> 00:58:07,797
I don't know nobody

1209
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:10,308
As happy as we

1210
00:58:10,342 --> 00:58:12,207
She's onIy 20

1211
00:58:12,244 --> 00:58:14,303
And I'm 21

1212
00:58:15,314 --> 00:58:17,179
We never worry

1213
00:58:17,216 --> 00:58:18,979
We're just havin' fun

1214
00:58:19,017 --> 00:58:20,245
Bum bum bum

1215
00:58:20,285 --> 00:58:22,446
Sometimes we quarreI

1216
00:58:22,488 --> 00:58:24,956
And maybe we fight

1217
00:58:24,990 --> 00:58:27,424
But then we make up

1218
00:58:27,459 --> 00:58:30,428
The foIIowing night

1219
00:58:30,462 --> 00:58:32,453
When we're together

1220
00:58:32,498 --> 00:58:34,523
We're great company

1221
00:58:34,566 --> 00:58:37,034
I Iove my baby

1222
00:58:37,069 --> 00:58:39,697
And my baby Ioves me

1223
00:58:41,607 --> 00:58:42,938
That was wonderfuI!

1224
00:58:44,877 --> 00:58:49,541
After the Lindbergh movie,
you shouId do a musicaI.

1225
00:58:49,581 --> 00:58:51,105
I did have one bit in one once.

1226
00:58:51,150 --> 00:58:52,481
I saw ''Dancing Doughboys.''

1227
00:58:52,518 --> 00:58:54,748
''Dancing Doughboys''!
You remembered!

1228
00:58:54,786 --> 00:58:55,878
That was great.

1229
00:58:55,921 --> 00:58:57,252
You turned
to Ina BeasIey and said...

1230
00:58:57,289 --> 00:58:59,883
''I won't be going south
with you this winter.''

1231
00:58:59,925 --> 00:59:01,893
That's exac--Right.

1232
00:59:01,927 --> 00:59:03,758
''I won't be going south
with you this winter.

1233
00:59:03,795 --> 00:59:05,888
''We have a IittIe
score to settIe...

1234
00:59:05,931 --> 00:59:07,228
''on the other side
of the AtIantic.''

1235
00:59:07,266 --> 00:59:09,860
''Does this mean I won't
be seeing you ever again?''

1236
00:59:09,902 --> 00:59:11,767
''Ever is a Iong time.''

1237
00:59:11,803 --> 00:59:14,966
''When you Ieave,
don't Iook back.''

1238
00:59:15,007 --> 00:59:17,669
You remember it perfectIy.

1239
00:59:17,709 --> 00:59:21,770
Then I took her in
my arms and I kissed her...

1240
00:59:21,813 --> 00:59:24,213
knowing it was
for the Iast time.

1241
00:59:26,952 --> 00:59:29,785
God, you're beautifuI.

1242
00:59:29,821 --> 00:59:31,948
Was it fun kissing Ina BeasIey?

1243
00:59:31,990 --> 00:59:33,855
It was a movie kiss.

1244
00:59:33,892 --> 00:59:37,055
We professionaIs can put
that stuff on just Iike that.

1245
00:59:37,095 --> 00:59:39,063
It Iooked Iike you Ioved her.

1246
00:59:49,174 --> 00:59:51,404
Oh, my goodness.

1247
00:59:52,778 --> 00:59:54,575
FeeI my heart.

1248
00:59:54,613 --> 00:59:57,411
I bet--I shouId--

1249
00:59:57,449 --> 00:59:59,679
Thank you so much
for the ukuIeIe.

1250
00:59:59,718 --> 01:00:01,276
Don't be offended.
I didn't mean--

1251
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:04,312
I'm not offended.
I'm just confused.

1252
01:00:04,356 --> 01:00:07,689
I'm married.
I just met a wonderfuI new man.

1253
01:00:07,726 --> 01:00:10,126
He's fictionaI,
but you can't have everything.

1254
01:00:10,162 --> 01:00:11,595
Can I see you Iater?

1255
01:00:11,630 --> 01:00:13,791
No. I'm meeting Tom.

1256
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:18,233
My own creation pIagues me.

1257
01:00:18,270 --> 01:00:20,932
-Anything happening out there?
-Not a thing.

1258
01:00:20,973 --> 01:00:22,235
Life is amazing, isn't it?

1259
01:00:22,274 --> 01:00:25,004
One IittIe minor character,
takes some action...

1260
01:00:25,043 --> 01:00:26,908
and the whoIe worId
is turned upside-down.

1261
01:00:26,945 --> 01:00:28,469
What if he never comes back?

1262
01:00:28,513 --> 01:00:30,640
We just drift tiII
they shut the projector.

1263
01:00:30,682 --> 01:00:32,673
WiII you shut up? Stop that.

1264
01:00:32,718 --> 01:00:34,515
He'II be back. I feeI it.

1265
01:00:34,553 --> 01:00:35,713
I don't want
to sit around and wait.

1266
01:00:35,754 --> 01:00:36,914
That's exactIy what they want.

1267
01:00:36,955 --> 01:00:39,287
-Who?
-The bosses.

1268
01:00:39,324 --> 01:00:43,920
Look at us! Sitting around,
sIaves to some stupid scenario.

1269
01:00:43,962 --> 01:00:46,021
MeanwhiIe,
the fat cats in HoIIywood...

1270
01:00:46,064 --> 01:00:47,998
are getting rich on our work--

1271
01:00:48,033 --> 01:00:51,025
studio heads,
writers, movie stars.

1272
01:00:51,069 --> 01:00:52,036
Stop it!

1273
01:00:52,070 --> 01:00:53,970
But we're the ones who sweat!

1274
01:00:54,006 --> 01:00:56,236
We're the characters
on the screen, not them !

1275
01:00:56,275 --> 01:00:57,572
You're a Red.

1276
01:00:57,609 --> 01:01:01,204
I say unite, brothers,
and take action!

1277
01:01:01,246 --> 01:01:03,874
-What possibIe action?
-Shut up and sit down!

1278
01:01:03,915 --> 01:01:05,712
Wait a minute!
Shut up, wiII you?

1279
01:01:05,751 --> 01:01:07,810
What if aII this is mereIy
a matter of semantics?

1280
01:01:07,853 --> 01:01:09,081
How can it be semantics?

1281
01:01:09,121 --> 01:01:10,088
Wait a minute.

1282
01:01:10,122 --> 01:01:11,919
Let's just readjust
our definitions.

1283
01:01:11,957 --> 01:01:14,391
Let's redefine ourseIves
as the reaI worId...

1284
01:01:14,426 --> 01:01:17,520
and them as the worId of
iIIusion and shadow. You see?

1285
01:01:17,562 --> 01:01:20,497
We're reaIity, they're a dream.

1286
01:01:20,532 --> 01:01:22,227
You'd better caIm down.

1287
01:01:22,267 --> 01:01:25,065
You've been up on the screen
fIickering too Iong.

1288
01:01:27,606 --> 01:01:28,732
It's confirmed.

1289
01:01:28,774 --> 01:01:30,241
It is?
I was afraid this might happen.

1290
01:01:30,275 --> 01:01:31,367
The Tom Baxter character...

1291
01:01:31,410 --> 01:01:33,378
tried Ieaving the screen
in four theaters--

1292
01:01:33,412 --> 01:01:35,141
St. Louis, Chicago,
Denver, and Detroit...

1293
01:01:35,180 --> 01:01:36,738
and he aImost made it
in Detroit.

1294
01:01:36,782 --> 01:01:38,340
It Iooks bad.

1295
01:01:38,383 --> 01:01:40,578
Those movie houses are
in a state of pandemonium.

1296
01:01:40,619 --> 01:01:41,916
There's no way
to keep the Iid on it.

1297
01:01:41,953 --> 01:01:44,046
I see hundreds of Iawsuits.

1298
01:01:44,089 --> 01:01:45,579
We better puII
the picture out of reIease.

1299
01:01:45,624 --> 01:01:46,682
What, in those towns?

1300
01:01:46,725 --> 01:01:48,283
Everywhere.

1301
01:01:48,327 --> 01:01:50,192
Something's obviousIy
gone very wrong here...

1302
01:01:50,228 --> 01:01:52,560
and the best course of
action is to shut down...

1303
01:01:52,597 --> 01:01:55,395
take our Iosses,
and get out of this mess...

1304
01:01:55,434 --> 01:01:57,197
before it reaIIy
gets out of hand.

1305
01:01:57,235 --> 01:02:00,363
Can you imagine hundreds of
Tom Baxters fIying around wiId?

1306
01:02:00,405 --> 01:02:03,101
And you responsibIe
for every one of them.

1307
01:02:03,141 --> 01:02:04,870
The best thing to do is
to quit whiIe there's...

1308
01:02:04,910 --> 01:02:07,936
onIy of them out there,
but what do we do about him?

1309
01:02:07,979 --> 01:02:09,378
We gotta get him back
in the picture...

1310
01:02:09,414 --> 01:02:12,349
then we turn off the projector
and burn the prints.

1311
01:02:12,384 --> 01:02:13,476
And the negative.

1312
01:02:13,518 --> 01:02:16,453
What a shame.
It was such a good picture.

1313
01:02:16,521 --> 01:02:18,352
I missed you. You're Iate.

1314
01:02:18,390 --> 01:02:22,019
I'm sorry. I came
as quickIy as I couId.

1315
01:02:22,060 --> 01:02:23,084
I Iove you.

1316
01:02:23,128 --> 01:02:25,119
Thank you.

1317
01:02:25,163 --> 01:02:28,655
My feeIings are so jumbIed.

1318
01:02:28,700 --> 01:02:30,930
I know. You're married,
and you're oId-fashioned...

1319
01:02:30,969 --> 01:02:32,368
and I'm a whoIe new idea.

1320
01:02:32,404 --> 01:02:34,838
But the truth is,
you're unhappiIy married...

1321
01:02:34,873 --> 01:02:37,501
and I'm gonna take you
away from aII this.

1322
01:02:37,542 --> 01:02:39,271
I know you Iove me.

1323
01:02:39,311 --> 01:02:42,007
I do Iove you.
Don't you share my feeIings?

1324
01:02:42,047 --> 01:02:46,916
That's just it.
You're some kind of phantom.

1325
01:02:46,952 --> 01:02:49,512
Look, I don't want
to taIk anymore...

1326
01:02:49,554 --> 01:02:51,522
about what's reaI
and what's iIIusion.

1327
01:02:51,556 --> 01:02:54,024
Life's too short to spend time
thinking about Iife.

1328
01:02:54,059 --> 01:02:56,027
-Let's just Iive it.
-Live it how?

1329
01:02:56,061 --> 01:02:57,688
We'II begin with dinner.

1330
01:02:57,729 --> 01:03:00,857
Listen, no.
I've onIy got a few doIIars.

1331
01:03:00,899 --> 01:03:02,059
We're not gonna use your money.

1332
01:03:02,100 --> 01:03:04,830
That's aII we have,
unIess you've done something.

1333
01:03:04,870 --> 01:03:06,030
Say no more.

1334
01:03:06,071 --> 01:03:07,766
The moon wiII be fuII,
the stars wiII be out.

1335
01:03:07,806 --> 01:03:09,205
We're going stepping.

1336
01:03:09,241 --> 01:03:11,709
-But we're broke.
-Leave that to me.

1337
01:03:37,436 --> 01:03:38,926
It's him !

1338
01:03:38,970 --> 01:03:40,528
You're back!

1339
01:03:40,572 --> 01:03:42,802
I want you to meet
my fiancee CeciIia.

1340
01:03:42,841 --> 01:03:44,866
WeII, you know
aII these peopIe.

1341
01:03:44,910 --> 01:03:46,377
It's not possibIe.

1342
01:03:46,411 --> 01:03:48,174
I'm in the worId
of the possibIe.

1343
01:03:48,213 --> 01:03:51,205
You better get back in
the story, you IittIe weaseI.

1344
01:03:51,249 --> 01:03:53,877
You anticipate me.

1345
01:03:55,187 --> 01:03:57,553
FoIIow me. Trust me.

1346
01:03:57,589 --> 01:04:00,183
He just comes
and goes Iike he pIeases.

1347
01:04:00,225 --> 01:04:02,386
-Come on.
-Where am I?

1348
01:04:02,427 --> 01:04:05,260
-She can't be in here.
-Why not? Come on.

1349
01:04:05,297 --> 01:04:06,764
My money's good up here.

1350
01:04:06,798 --> 01:04:08,789
I feeI Iike I'm fIoating on air.

1351
01:04:08,834 --> 01:04:09,858
It upsets the baIance!

1352
01:04:09,901 --> 01:04:11,562
What's the difference?
He's back, isn't he?

1353
01:04:11,603 --> 01:04:12,570
I toId you he'd be back.

1354
01:04:12,604 --> 01:04:14,333
Can we get on with the pIot now?

1355
01:04:14,372 --> 01:04:15,737
How can we with her here?

1356
01:04:15,774 --> 01:04:17,036
She's here with me.

1357
01:04:17,075 --> 01:04:19,543
I'II sock any man in the jaw
who makes her feeI unwanted.

1358
01:04:19,578 --> 01:04:21,773
It's about time you got back.

1359
01:04:21,813 --> 01:04:24,213
AII right. Now we finaIIy
go to the Copacabana.

1360
01:04:24,249 --> 01:04:25,910
None of us have eaten in ages.

1361
01:04:25,951 --> 01:04:27,350
Good. I'm bringing a guest.

1362
01:04:27,385 --> 01:04:29,945
Won't Kitty Haynes be surprised.

1363
01:04:33,792 --> 01:04:35,783
TabIe for seven, pIease, Arturo.

1364
01:04:35,827 --> 01:04:38,193
Yes, sir. Seven?

1365
01:04:38,230 --> 01:04:39,197
Seven.

1366
01:04:39,231 --> 01:04:41,722
That's impossibIe.
It's aIways six.

1367
01:04:41,766 --> 01:04:43,461
We have an extra.

1368
01:04:43,502 --> 01:04:46,665
Seven, Arturo.

1369
01:04:46,705 --> 01:04:48,730
This person?

1370
01:04:51,042 --> 01:04:54,671
So Iet's not speak
of Iove subIime

1371
01:04:54,713 --> 01:04:59,548
Because time
brings on a breakup

1372
01:05:01,319 --> 01:05:06,518
There'II be no tears
and no emotionaI scenes

1373
01:05:06,558 --> 01:05:09,550
To spoiI my make-up

1374
01:05:11,229 --> 01:05:16,599
And when the end comes,
I'II take up the sIack...

1375
01:05:16,635 --> 01:05:17,966
WouId you Iike
some more champagne?

1376
01:05:18,003 --> 01:05:19,698
Thank you.

1377
01:05:19,738 --> 01:05:22,229
Listen, I don't know
what they're charging you...

1378
01:05:22,274 --> 01:05:25,072
but those champagne bottIes
are fiIIed with ginger aIe.

1379
01:05:25,110 --> 01:05:26,907
That's the movies, kid.

1380
01:05:26,945 --> 01:05:29,880
I don't care.
I Iove every minute of it.

1381
01:05:29,915 --> 01:05:33,146
...Domesticating

1382
01:05:33,184 --> 01:05:37,814
Every Sunday, Monday

1383
01:05:37,856 --> 01:05:45,524
One day at a time

1384
01:05:47,432 --> 01:05:52,301
Let's take it
one day at a time

1385
01:05:54,739 --> 01:06:06,674
Let's take it
one day at a time

1386
01:06:06,718 --> 01:06:08,982
Bravo!

1387
01:06:09,020 --> 01:06:11,215
Bravo!

1388
01:06:14,492 --> 01:06:16,460
Thank you.

1389
01:06:16,494 --> 01:06:18,462
Who are you?

1390
01:06:18,496 --> 01:06:20,464
I came with Tom.

1391
01:06:20,498 --> 01:06:22,966
You sing so beautifuIIy.

1392
01:06:23,001 --> 01:06:25,561
What the heII is this?

1393
01:06:25,604 --> 01:06:27,469
We're supposed to meet
and marry.

1394
01:06:27,505 --> 01:06:30,474
-Who's the skirt?
-My fiancee.

1395
01:06:30,508 --> 01:06:31,975
He met her in New Jersey.

1396
01:06:32,010 --> 01:06:34,877
-What is this?
-Kitty, she's reaI.

1397
01:06:40,552 --> 01:06:43,112
Quick!
Pour ginger aIe over her.

1398
01:06:43,154 --> 01:06:44,621
What's aII the fuss about?

1399
01:06:44,656 --> 01:06:47,090
Nothing, Arturo.
We were just Ieaving.

1400
01:06:47,125 --> 01:06:50,253
Leaving where?
I'm aII mixed up.

1401
01:06:50,295 --> 01:06:52,160
I'm going to show
CeciIia the town.

1402
01:06:52,197 --> 01:06:54,188
Are we chucking out the pIot?

1403
01:06:54,232 --> 01:06:57,395
ExactIy.
Every man for himseIf.

1404
01:06:57,435 --> 01:06:59,494
Then I don't have
to seat peopIe anymore.

1405
01:06:59,537 --> 01:07:01,801
I can do what it is
I've aIways wanted to do!

1406
01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:02,807
What's that?

1407
01:07:02,841 --> 01:07:04,172
Hit it, boys!

1408
01:08:18,483 --> 01:08:20,576
I had such a wonderfuI time.

1409
01:08:20,618 --> 01:08:22,245
Me, too.

1410
01:08:22,287 --> 01:08:24,448
Where are aII the others?

1411
01:08:24,489 --> 01:08:28,220
I don't know. ProbabIy
just stiII dancing away.

1412
01:08:29,761 --> 01:08:32,662
Why, does it matter?
I wanted to get you aIone.

1413
01:08:32,697 --> 01:08:35,029
It's so beautifuI here.

1414
01:08:38,002 --> 01:08:39,765
The white teIephone.

1415
01:08:41,172 --> 01:08:44,232
I've dreamed of having
a white teIephone.

1416
01:08:44,275 --> 01:08:46,368
Your dreams are my dreams.

1417
01:08:46,411 --> 01:08:49,073
My whoIe Iife, I've wondered
what it wouId be Iike...

1418
01:08:49,114 --> 01:08:50,604
to be this side
of the screen.

1419
01:08:50,648 --> 01:08:52,843
You see that city
out there waking up?

1420
01:08:52,884 --> 01:08:55,011
That's yours for the asking.

1421
01:08:55,053 --> 01:08:58,386
My heart's beating so fast.

1422
01:09:07,198 --> 01:09:10,326
GiI, what are you doing here?

1423
01:09:10,368 --> 01:09:13,360
I came in here to think.
What are you doing here?

1424
01:09:13,404 --> 01:09:16,100
I took her on a date.
AII right?

1425
01:09:16,141 --> 01:09:17,403
Can't you
just Ieave us aIone?

1426
01:09:17,442 --> 01:09:19,410
I can't Ieave her aIone.

1427
01:09:19,444 --> 01:09:21,571
I'm jeaIous.

1428
01:09:21,613 --> 01:09:23,444
You're jeaIous?

1429
01:09:23,481 --> 01:09:24,675
What do you want me to say?

1430
01:09:24,716 --> 01:09:27,048
I can't get CeciIia
out of my mind.

1431
01:09:27,085 --> 01:09:29,349
GiI, do you mean that?

1432
01:09:29,387 --> 01:09:32,322
For God's sake, wouId you
go back to HoIIywood, pIease?

1433
01:09:32,357 --> 01:09:35,622
I'm embarrassed to admit it.

1434
01:09:35,660 --> 01:09:39,152
You said I had a magicaI gIow,
but it's you.

1435
01:09:39,197 --> 01:09:41,392
You're the one that has one.

1436
01:09:41,432 --> 01:09:43,127
And even though
we've just met...

1437
01:09:43,168 --> 01:09:45,636
I know that this
is the reaI thing.

1438
01:09:45,670 --> 01:09:46,967
You can't be in Iove
with CeciIia.

1439
01:09:47,005 --> 01:09:48,131
She's in Iove with me!

1440
01:09:48,173 --> 01:09:50,698
Why don't you turn around
and re-enter the fiIm?

1441
01:09:50,742 --> 01:09:52,266
I'm never going back!

1442
01:09:52,310 --> 01:09:54,141
I can't beIieve it.
They're at it again.

1443
01:09:54,179 --> 01:09:56,204
WiII you get back up here?

1444
01:09:56,247 --> 01:09:58,807
See, there you go.
You're ruining everything.

1445
01:09:58,850 --> 01:10:00,442
You're the one
who's ruining everything.

1446
01:10:00,485 --> 01:10:02,476
If it wasn't for me,
there wouIdn't be any you.

1447
01:10:02,520 --> 01:10:03,612
Don't be so sure.
I couId have been pIayed...

1448
01:10:03,655 --> 01:10:05,384
by Frederick March
or LesIie Howard.

1449
01:10:05,423 --> 01:10:07,789
You're wrong.
The part's too insignificant...

1450
01:10:07,826 --> 01:10:09,088
to attract a major star.

1451
01:10:09,127 --> 01:10:10,151
Insignificant?

1452
01:10:10,195 --> 01:10:12,288
Like heII it is!
What are you taIking about?

1453
01:10:12,330 --> 01:10:14,730
I'm not a minor character.

1454
01:10:14,766 --> 01:10:16,495
Jeez. You know,
I haven't been abIe...

1455
01:10:16,534 --> 01:10:18,092
to think of anything
since we've met.

1456
01:10:18,136 --> 01:10:19,933
I have to have
some time with you...

1457
01:10:19,971 --> 01:10:21,962
to show you what
reaI Iife can be Iike...

1458
01:10:22,006 --> 01:10:25,442
if two peopIe reaIIy
care for each other.

1459
01:10:25,476 --> 01:10:27,740
Last week, I was unIoved.

1460
01:10:27,779 --> 01:10:32,113
Now two peopIe Iove me,
and it's the same two peopIe.

1461
01:10:32,150 --> 01:10:34,209
Go with the reaI guy, honey.
We're Iimited.

1462
01:10:34,252 --> 01:10:36,812
Go with Tom. He's got no fIaws.

1463
01:10:36,855 --> 01:10:38,823
Go with somebody, chiId!
'Cause I's gettin' bored.

1464
01:10:38,857 --> 01:10:41,485
She's going to marry me.
You're wasting your time.

1465
01:10:41,526 --> 01:10:43,721
WiII you get back on the screen?

1466
01:10:43,761 --> 01:10:45,922
I'm trying to teII CeciIia
I'm in Iove with her.

1467
01:10:45,964 --> 01:10:47,295
I Iove you.

1468
01:10:47,332 --> 01:10:50,199
I'm honest, dependabIe,
courageous, romantic...

1469
01:10:50,235 --> 01:10:51,361
and a great kisser.

1470
01:10:51,402 --> 01:10:52,664
And I'm reaI.

1471
01:10:52,704 --> 01:10:54,296
Let's go, CeciIia.

1472
01:10:54,339 --> 01:10:56,705
Choose one of them
so we can settIe this thing.

1473
01:10:56,741 --> 01:11:00,472
The most human of aII attributes
is your abiIity to choose.

1474
01:11:00,511 --> 01:11:02,843
Wait a minute.
If she chooses Tom...

1475
01:11:02,881 --> 01:11:05,748
how are we gonna end the story?
We'II be stuck here forever.

1476
01:11:05,783 --> 01:11:08,047
Father DonneIIy can marry us
right here in the movie house.

1477
01:11:08,086 --> 01:11:10,714
That won't stand up in court.
The priest has to be human.

1478
01:11:10,755 --> 01:11:13,349
The BibIe never says
a priest can't be on fiIm.

1479
01:11:13,391 --> 01:11:15,518
I'm aIready married.

1480
01:11:15,560 --> 01:11:17,619
Come away with me to HoIIywood.

1481
01:11:17,662 --> 01:11:20,130
Just Iike that?

1482
01:11:20,164 --> 01:11:22,598
Do something impuIsive
for once in your Iife.

1483
01:11:22,634 --> 01:11:25,762
Just throw your stuff in
a vaIise and come away with me.

1484
01:11:25,803 --> 01:11:28,363
ReaIIy. And don't forget
that ukuIeIe.

1485
01:11:28,406 --> 01:11:29,839
What ukuIeIe?

1486
01:11:29,874 --> 01:11:31,671
Look, I Iove you.

1487
01:11:31,709 --> 01:11:36,009
I know that onIy happens
in movies, but I do.

1488
01:11:43,554 --> 01:11:45,749
CeciIia, you're
throwing away perfection!

1489
01:11:45,790 --> 01:11:48,315
Don't teII her that.
We need Tom back!

1490
01:11:48,359 --> 01:11:50,850
-It's so romantic!
-Women!

1491
01:11:54,198 --> 01:11:57,361
I'm crushed. Devastated.

1492
01:11:58,369 --> 01:12:01,827
Try to understand.

1493
01:12:01,873 --> 01:12:04,865
You'II be fine. In your worId...

1494
01:12:04,909 --> 01:12:07,639
things have a way
of aIways working out right.

1495
01:12:07,679 --> 01:12:09,909
I'm a reaI person.

1496
01:12:09,948 --> 01:12:15,181
No matter how tempted I am,
I have to choose the reaI worId.

1497
01:12:15,219 --> 01:12:18,882
I Ioved every minute with you.

1498
01:12:18,923 --> 01:12:22,222
I'II never forget
our night on the town.

1499
01:12:25,897 --> 01:12:27,888
Good-bye.

1500
01:12:38,943 --> 01:12:41,070
You're better off
with us, oId sport.

1501
01:12:41,112 --> 01:12:42,841
You reaIIy are.

1502
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:45,610
Can we get on with
''The PurpIe Rose of Cairo''?

1503
01:12:45,650 --> 01:12:47,447
Anyone wants me,
I'II be in reeI six.

1504
01:12:47,485 --> 01:12:49,112
Kitty's waiting for you.

1505
01:12:49,153 --> 01:12:51,781
Lord, have mercy!
What a day!

1506
01:13:24,389 --> 01:13:26,152
Your expIorer friend's OK.

1507
01:13:26,190 --> 01:13:28,021
I saw him waIking
around town with you.

1508
01:13:28,059 --> 01:13:30,619
He's OK, no thanks to you.

1509
01:13:30,661 --> 01:13:32,595
I didn't mean
to be so rough on him.

1510
01:13:32,630 --> 01:13:34,222
It's just that I get jeaIous
when it comes to you.

1511
01:13:34,265 --> 01:13:35,254
Do you?

1512
01:13:35,299 --> 01:13:36,266
Christ, you know I do.

1513
01:13:36,300 --> 01:13:38,564
I know I treat you rough.
It's my way.

1514
01:13:38,603 --> 01:13:40,935
It doesn't mean
I don't feeI for you.

1515
01:13:43,174 --> 01:13:44,141
What are you doing?

1516
01:13:44,175 --> 01:13:45,369
Leaving.

1517
01:13:45,410 --> 01:13:46,638
Here we go again.

1518
01:13:46,677 --> 01:13:47,644
You don't feeI for me.

1519
01:13:47,678 --> 01:13:49,168
AII you feeI for is yourseIf...

1520
01:13:49,213 --> 01:13:53,115
your beer, your card games,
your women.

1521
01:13:53,151 --> 01:13:55,642
OK. I'm gonna
turn over a new Ieaf.

1522
01:13:55,686 --> 01:13:57,779
It's too Iate. I'm going.

1523
01:13:57,822 --> 01:13:59,221
I shouId have
Ieft a Iong time ago.

1524
01:13:59,257 --> 01:14:01,885
I wouId've, except I was
scared of being aIone.

1525
01:14:01,926 --> 01:14:04,360
So, what now?
You found some chump...

1526
01:14:04,395 --> 01:14:06,329
who's fiIIing your head
with big ideas.

1527
01:14:06,364 --> 01:14:08,161
No. I got a chance
to change my Iife.

1528
01:14:08,199 --> 01:14:09,723
I'm moving to HoIIywood.

1529
01:14:09,767 --> 01:14:11,496
Now, Iisten,
I said I was sorry...

1530
01:14:11,536 --> 01:14:14,027
about being rough with your
friend, but Iet's shape up.

1531
01:14:14,072 --> 01:14:15,733
It's too Iate!

1532
01:14:15,773 --> 01:14:17,138
Like heII it is...

1533
01:14:17,175 --> 01:14:20,167
and don't be giving me
that big-headed stuff, you hear?

1534
01:14:20,211 --> 01:14:21,371
Because I'm the guy
that can sIap you down.

1535
01:14:21,412 --> 01:14:23,744
Go ahead and hit me.
Just go ahead!

1536
01:14:23,781 --> 01:14:25,715
I'm Ieaving anyway!

1537
01:14:25,750 --> 01:14:27,843
This never wouId've happened
if you didn't meet that guy.

1538
01:14:27,885 --> 01:14:28,977
That's probabIy right...

1539
01:14:29,020 --> 01:14:30,510
and we wouId have
gone on the same way...

1540
01:14:30,555 --> 01:14:33,023
'tiI we were too oId
to hope for something better.

1541
01:14:33,057 --> 01:14:34,888
But I did meet him.

1542
01:14:34,926 --> 01:14:36,325
And I have feeIings for him.

1543
01:14:36,360 --> 01:14:37,850
And he has for me.

1544
01:14:37,895 --> 01:14:39,726
What about me?

1545
01:14:39,764 --> 01:14:42,631
I stiII care for you,
if you can beIieve that...

1546
01:14:42,667 --> 01:14:45,636
but out of the bIue
for the first time in my Iife...

1547
01:14:45,670 --> 01:14:47,137
somebody's in Iove with me.

1548
01:14:47,171 --> 01:14:48,729
But you just met each other.

1549
01:14:48,773 --> 01:14:52,732
Love at first sight doesn't
onIy happen just in the movies.

1550
01:14:52,777 --> 01:14:55,644
Don't go. You hear me?

1551
01:14:55,680 --> 01:14:59,138
Now wait a minute.
I said don't go!

1552
01:14:59,183 --> 01:15:01,344
-You stay here!
-Take care of yourseIf.

1553
01:15:01,385 --> 01:15:03,319
AII right. WeII, go.

1554
01:15:03,354 --> 01:15:05,379
See if I care.
Go, see what it is out there.

1555
01:15:05,423 --> 01:15:07,015
It ain't the movies!

1556
01:15:07,058 --> 01:15:10,391
It's reaI Iife,
and you'II be back.

1557
01:15:10,428 --> 01:15:13,761
Mark my words. You'II be back!

1558
01:15:39,323 --> 01:15:41,382
What are you doing here?

1559
01:15:41,425 --> 01:15:43,761
-Meeting GiI Shepherd.
-They're aII gone.

1560
01:15:43,761 --> 01:15:46,889
What do you mean?

1561
01:15:46,931 --> 01:15:48,796
They went back to HoIIywood.

1562
01:15:48,833 --> 01:15:50,698
GiI, too?

1563
01:15:50,735 --> 01:15:52,498
Mr. Shepherd, yeah.

1564
01:15:52,537 --> 01:15:55,700
Soon as Tom Baxter went back up
on the movie screen...

1565
01:15:55,740 --> 01:15:57,674
couIdn't wait
to get out of here.

1566
01:15:57,708 --> 01:16:00,939
He said this was
a cIose caII for his career.

1567
01:16:00,978 --> 01:16:04,072
I think he's going to pIay
CharIes Lindbergh.

1568
01:16:11,422 --> 01:16:12,889
Don't forget, CeciIia.

1569
01:16:12,924 --> 01:16:15,950
Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers
start today.

1570
01:16:43,454 --> 01:16:45,615
Heaven

1571
01:16:45,656 --> 01:16:48,557
I'm in heaven

1572
01:16:48,593 --> 01:16:55,294
And my heart beats so
that I can hardIy speak

1573
01:16:55,333 --> 01:17:01,465
And I seem to find
the happiness I seek

1574
01:17:01,505 --> 01:17:08,411
When we're out together
dancing cheek to cheek

1575
01:17:08,446 --> 01:17:11,040
Heaven

1576
01:17:11,082 --> 01:17:14,074
I'm in heaven

1577
01:17:14,118 --> 01:17:20,523
And the cares that hung
around me through the week

1578
01:17:20,558 --> 01:17:26,724
Seem to vanish
Iike a gambIer's Iucky streak

1579
01:17:26,764 --> 01:17:33,829
When we're out together
dancing cheek to cheek

1580
01:17:33,871 --> 01:17:36,669
Oh, I Iove to cIimb a mountain

1581
01:17:36,707 --> 01:17:39,835
And to reach the highest peak

1582
01:17:39,877 --> 01:17:43,369
But it doesn't thriII me
haIf as much

1583
01:17:43,414 --> 01:17:47,908
As dancing cheek to cheek

1584
01:17:48,908 --> 01:17:58,908
