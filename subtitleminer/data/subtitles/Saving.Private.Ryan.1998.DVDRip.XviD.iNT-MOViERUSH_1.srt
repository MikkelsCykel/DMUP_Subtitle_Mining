1
00:03:43,175 --> 00:03:44,802
Dad...

2
00:05:30,324 --> 00:05:34,912
Clear the ramp! 30 seconds!
God be with you!

3
00:05:34,996 --> 00:05:37,164
Port side, stick.
Starboard side, stick.

4
00:05:37,248 --> 00:05:39,584
Move fast and clear
those mortar holes.

5
00:05:39,667 --> 00:05:42,420
l want to see plenty
of beach between men.

6
00:05:42,503 --> 00:05:46,382
Five men is an opportunity.
One is a waste of ammo.

7
00:05:46,465 --> 00:05:48,759
Keep the sand
out of your weapons.

8
00:05:48,843 --> 00:05:50,595
Keep those actions clear.

9
00:05:50,678 --> 00:05:52,722
l'll see you on the beach.

10
00:06:25,379 --> 00:06:27,798
Open mortar holes!

11
00:06:43,773 --> 00:06:45,524
Over the side!

12
00:06:51,948 --> 00:06:54,116
Port and starboard, over...

13
00:08:03,227 --> 00:08:04,895
Jesus.

14
00:08:04,979 --> 00:08:06,314
Thank you...

15
00:10:25,786 --> 00:10:29,081
l said, what the hell
do we do now, sir?

16
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:31,626
Captain Miller!

17
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:33,711
Captain Miller!

18
00:10:35,004 --> 00:10:36,714
Captain Miller!

19
00:10:36,797 --> 00:10:39,634
Sergeant Horvath!

20
00:10:39,717 --> 00:10:41,886
Move your men off the beach!

21
00:10:41,969 --> 00:10:43,596
Go!

22
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:45,640
OK, you guys!

23
00:10:45,723 --> 00:10:48,684
Get on my ass! Follow me!

24
00:10:48,768 --> 00:10:50,519
What's the rallying point?

25
00:10:50,603 --> 00:10:52,647
Anywhere but here!

26
00:11:05,076 --> 00:11:06,619
The sea wall!

27
00:11:06,702 --> 00:11:08,246
Move up to the sea wall!

28
00:11:08,329 --> 00:11:10,122
Sir, l'm staying!

29
00:11:10,206 --> 00:11:13,292
Clear this beach!
Make way for the others!

30
00:11:13,376 --> 00:11:15,670
This is all we got!

31
00:11:15,753 --> 00:11:19,757
Every inch of this beach
has been pre-sighted!

32
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:23,427
You stay here, you're dead men!

33
00:11:36,732 --> 00:11:38,359
Mama!

34
00:11:38,901 --> 00:11:40,069
Mama!

35
00:11:44,782 --> 00:11:47,368
Stay down! Stay down!

36
00:11:51,998 --> 00:11:53,541
What are you guys?

37
00:11:53,624 --> 00:11:56,586
104th Medical Battalion, sir!

38
00:11:56,669 --> 00:11:59,130
Here to set up field operations!

39
00:11:59,213 --> 00:12:01,048
Get rid of that crap!

40
00:12:01,132 --> 00:12:04,385
Grab yourselves some weapons.
Follow me.

41
00:12:10,975 --> 00:12:12,643
l'm hit!

42
00:12:12,727 --> 00:12:13,894
Briggs!

43
00:12:19,025 --> 00:12:20,276
Get me out!

44
00:12:20,359 --> 00:12:22,987
l'm hit low. God!

45
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:24,572
Medic!

46
00:12:24,655 --> 00:12:26,616
Navy Beach Battalion, sir.

47
00:12:26,699 --> 00:12:29,535
l gotta clear these obstacles
for the tanks.

48
00:12:29,619 --> 00:12:32,079
All the armour's
foundering in the Channel.

49
00:12:32,163 --> 00:12:33,414
Orders, sir.

50
00:12:33,497 --> 00:12:36,125
You go somewhere else.
l'm clearing this one!

51
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:37,376
Come on, Briggs!

52
00:12:42,632 --> 00:12:43,716
Medic!

53
00:13:20,586 --> 00:13:22,296
Move! Move!

54
00:13:29,387 --> 00:13:32,431
Move! Come on!

55
00:13:32,515 --> 00:13:33,891
Move!

56
00:13:54,287 --> 00:13:56,372
Shore party.

57
00:13:56,455 --> 00:13:58,374
No armour has made it ashore.

58
00:13:58,457 --> 00:14:00,543
We got no DD tanks.

59
00:14:00,626 --> 00:14:03,629
Dog One is not open.

60
00:14:03,713 --> 00:14:06,173
Who's in command here?

61
00:14:06,257 --> 00:14:08,259
You are, sir!

62
00:14:09,093 --> 00:14:11,095
- Sergeant Horvath!
- Sir!

63
00:14:11,178 --> 00:14:13,389
You recognise where we are?

64
00:14:13,472 --> 00:14:16,892
Right where we're supposed to
be, but no one else is!

65
00:14:16,976 --> 00:14:19,562
Nobody's where
they're supposed to be.

66
00:14:19,645 --> 00:14:21,314
Shore party.

67
00:14:22,356 --> 00:14:23,983
First wave, ineffective.

68
00:14:24,066 --> 00:14:29,488
We do not hold the beach. Say
again, we do not hold the beach.

69
00:14:29,572 --> 00:14:32,742
Sir, we got the leftovers
from Fox Company,

70
00:14:32,825 --> 00:14:34,702
Able Company
and George Company!

71
00:14:34,785 --> 00:14:38,998
Plus we got some Navy Demo guys
and a Beachmaster!

72
00:14:39,081 --> 00:14:40,625
Shore party.

73
00:14:41,584 --> 00:14:43,044
Shore party.

74
00:14:48,174 --> 00:14:51,510
Cat-F, Cat-F, C...

75
00:14:54,597 --> 00:14:57,016
- Reiben here, sir!
- Anybody else?

76
00:14:57,099 --> 00:14:58,684
Jackson, but that's about it.

77
00:14:58,768 --> 00:15:01,020
Mellish here.

78
00:15:01,103 --> 00:15:03,230
Caparzo!
DeForest's back with Wade.

79
00:15:03,314 --> 00:15:06,609
He's hurt so bad he says
he sprung 100 leaks.

80
00:15:06,692 --> 00:15:08,819
Wade says he's all used up.

81
00:15:08,903 --> 00:15:10,613
Find somebody you can help.

82
00:15:10,696 --> 00:15:14,033
He's battalion surgeon, sir!

83
00:15:17,745 --> 00:15:18,829
Get his attention.

84
00:15:18,913 --> 00:15:19,914
Wade!

85
00:15:19,997 --> 00:15:20,957
Yo, doc!

86
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,417
Wade!

87
00:15:30,508 --> 00:15:32,426
Get him off the beach.

88
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:34,720
l got it!
We stopped the bleeding!

89
00:15:34,804 --> 00:15:37,348
We stopped the bleeding!

90
00:15:37,431 --> 00:15:38,891
Fuck!

91
00:15:38,975 --> 00:15:42,812
Just give us a fucking chance,
you son of a bitch!

92
00:15:42,895 --> 00:15:44,855
Son of a fucking cocksucker!

93
00:15:44,939 --> 00:15:47,441
Come on, Wade! lt's Mellish!

94
00:15:47,525 --> 00:15:49,318
Wade!

95
00:15:50,778 --> 00:15:54,240
We found Miller!
Let's move! Let's move!

96
00:15:54,323 --> 00:15:57,368
Oh, God. Oh, God.

97
00:16:01,581 --> 00:16:04,542
This is all?
This is all that's made it?

98
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:06,377
We got scattered
pretty bad, sir.

99
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:08,337
There's bound to be more.

100
00:16:08,421 --> 00:16:11,048
Not enough. This is not enough.

101
00:16:11,132 --> 00:16:12,341
Dog One exit...

102
00:16:12,425 --> 00:16:14,802
On the right.
Or is it left? Shit!

103
00:16:14,885 --> 00:16:18,681
No, Vierville is west of us.
This is Dog One.

104
00:16:18,764 --> 00:16:20,182
They're killing us!

105
00:16:20,266 --> 00:16:23,561
We don't have a fucking chance,
and that ain't fair!

106
00:16:23,644 --> 00:16:25,896
Gather weapons and ammo!

107
00:16:26,439 --> 00:16:28,608
Gather weapons and ammo!

108
00:16:28,691 --> 00:16:31,777
Come on,
drag 'em in off the sand!

109
00:16:40,453 --> 00:16:42,204
Hey, Reiben, Reiben, Reiben,

110
00:16:42,288 --> 00:16:43,789
where's your BAR?

111
00:16:43,873 --> 00:16:46,667
Bottom of the channel, sir.
Nearly drowned me.

112
00:16:46,751 --> 00:16:48,711
Find a replacement.

113
00:16:50,671 --> 00:16:53,633
Bangalores!
Bring up some bangalores!

114
00:16:53,716 --> 00:16:56,886
Grenades, grenades!

115
00:16:56,969 --> 00:16:58,638
Get 'em over here!

116
00:17:01,265 --> 00:17:03,100
Bangalores up the line!

117
00:17:03,184 --> 00:17:05,269
Bangalores up the line!

118
00:17:05,353 --> 00:17:07,647
Heads up!
Bangers coming your way!

119
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:09,941
Come on, come on, come on!

120
00:17:10,024 --> 00:17:11,108
Jackson here, sir!

121
00:17:11,192 --> 00:17:12,401
Reiben back, sir!

122
00:17:19,784 --> 00:17:22,370
One more. Give me one more.

123
00:17:25,915 --> 00:17:28,584
Oh, my God, it hurts!

124
00:17:28,668 --> 00:17:30,002
l'm gonna die!

125
00:17:30,086 --> 00:17:32,505
Oh, my God! Oh, Jesus!

126
00:17:32,588 --> 00:17:33,714
Oh, my God!

127
00:17:34,966 --> 00:17:36,801
Keep it moving. Keep it moving.

128
00:17:36,884 --> 00:17:38,594
Almost got it.

129
00:17:38,678 --> 00:17:39,679
Jesus!

130
00:17:39,762 --> 00:17:42,515
Lucky bastard.

131
00:17:42,598 --> 00:17:44,892
Keep it moving. You got it?

132
00:17:44,976 --> 00:17:48,562
God! God, help me!

133
00:17:48,646 --> 00:17:50,982
You're not gonna die.

134
00:17:51,065 --> 00:17:53,818
You're fine. Don't look at it.

135
00:17:53,901 --> 00:17:57,655
Bangalores! Clear the shingle!

136
00:17:57,738 --> 00:18:01,951
Fire in the hole!
Fire in the hole!

137
00:18:15,172 --> 00:18:17,633
We're in business! Defilade!

138
00:18:17,717 --> 00:18:19,635
Other side of the hole!

139
00:18:32,356 --> 00:18:34,317
That's it! Let's go!

140
00:18:37,612 --> 00:18:39,822
lnspected. Morphine.

141
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:44,785
Routine.

142
00:18:49,707 --> 00:18:51,667
Priority.

143
00:18:55,338 --> 00:18:56,339
He's gone.

144
00:19:09,602 --> 00:19:11,604
Son of a...

145
00:19:11,687 --> 00:19:13,773
Get in there.

146
00:19:13,856 --> 00:19:15,232
Fuck. l can't move.

147
00:19:15,316 --> 00:19:17,360
Mellish, give me your bayonet.

148
00:19:37,588 --> 00:19:39,840
Two MG-42s and two mortars.

149
00:19:39,924 --> 00:19:42,051
Add 20, left 30.

150
00:19:44,762 --> 00:19:46,347
There's a little defilade,

151
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:49,684
but it's the perfect position
if we get some armour.

152
00:19:49,767 --> 00:19:52,645
We gotta open up this draw!
Get this draw open.

153
00:19:52,728 --> 00:19:54,730
Reiben, Mellish,
let's get into the war!

154
00:19:54,814 --> 00:19:57,900
Grab some cover and put
some fire on that crew.

155
00:19:57,984 --> 00:20:01,946
Davis, DeBernardo, Young, Valk,
get ready.

156
00:20:03,573 --> 00:20:05,449
Covering fire!

157
00:20:09,245 --> 00:20:11,330
Go, go, go!

158
00:20:24,635 --> 00:20:26,512
Goddamn firing squad.

159
00:20:26,596 --> 00:20:29,849
lt's the only way
we can get everybody out.

160
00:20:29,932 --> 00:20:32,393
Short, Payton, McDonald, Parkes!

161
00:20:32,476 --> 00:20:34,312
You're next!

162
00:20:34,395 --> 00:20:38,774
- Why not hand out blindfolds?
- All we'll do here is die.

163
00:20:38,858 --> 00:20:40,693
Covering fire!

164
00:20:42,486 --> 00:20:45,114
Go, go, go!

165
00:20:45,197 --> 00:20:46,198
Come on!

166
00:20:46,282 --> 00:20:48,117
Come on! Come on!

167
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,619
Go, Goddamit!

168
00:21:02,048 --> 00:21:03,549
Jackson.

169
00:21:03,633 --> 00:21:04,634
Sir.

170
00:21:04,717 --> 00:21:06,344
See that impact crater?

171
00:21:06,427 --> 00:21:07,553
Yes, sir.

172
00:21:07,637 --> 00:21:11,766
That should give complete
defilade from that machine gun.

173
00:21:11,849 --> 00:21:14,101
Wait for my command.

174
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,441
Go!

175
00:21:31,494 --> 00:21:35,122
Captain, if your mother
saw that, she'd be very upset.

176
00:21:35,206 --> 00:21:37,833
l thought you were my mother.

177
00:21:38,376 --> 00:21:41,379
Be not thou far from me,
O Lord.

178
00:21:45,841 --> 00:21:48,844
My God, l am sorry
for offending Thee.

179
00:21:51,222 --> 00:21:54,767
l detest my sins for having
offended Thee, O Lord.

180
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:55,977
Listen to me, Lord.

181
00:22:02,149 --> 00:22:04,151
All my strength...

182
00:22:04,235 --> 00:22:06,112
haste Thee to help me.

183
00:22:21,544 --> 00:22:24,964
Dog One exit! Right here!

184
00:22:25,047 --> 00:22:26,757
We're in business!

185
00:22:27,967 --> 00:22:30,011
Move! Move!

186
00:23:11,177 --> 00:23:12,136
Reiben.

187
00:23:12,219 --> 00:23:14,680
- Let's go, sarge. Go!
- Reiben.

188
00:23:42,833 --> 00:23:44,377
Come on, Doyle!

189
00:23:46,254 --> 00:23:47,421
Sarge.

190
00:23:52,677 --> 00:23:54,095
Flame!

191
00:23:54,178 --> 00:23:55,972
Doyle, do it!

192
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:03,312
Don't shoot! Let 'em burn!

193
00:24:25,251 --> 00:24:27,587
''Comrade?'' You son of a bitch!

194
00:24:28,629 --> 00:24:30,631
Lie down!

195
00:24:58,659 --> 00:25:01,120
Cease fire! Cease fire!

196
00:25:01,203 --> 00:25:02,163
Cut it out!

197
00:25:02,246 --> 00:25:04,749
Cut it out! Cease fire!

198
00:25:04,832 --> 00:25:07,335
Sugar Cane. Sugar Charlie Three.

199
00:25:07,418 --> 00:25:10,504
Say again, Dog One is open.
Send in the dozers.

200
00:25:10,588 --> 00:25:14,175
l'm waiting
to tie in my flanks. Over.

201
00:25:14,258 --> 00:25:15,801
What?

202
00:25:18,721 --> 00:25:22,183
What? l'm sorry,
l can't understand you.

203
00:25:29,649 --> 00:25:32,568
What'd he say? What'd he say?

204
00:25:32,652 --> 00:25:35,571
''Look, l washed for supper.''

205
00:25:48,292 --> 00:25:50,419
- Hey, Fish.
- Yeah?

206
00:25:50,503 --> 00:25:54,131
Look at this.
A Hitler Youth knife.

207
00:25:54,215 --> 00:25:56,592
Now it's a Shabbat challah
cutter, right?

208
00:26:06,769 --> 00:26:08,396
Keep it moving!

209
00:27:08,706 --> 00:27:10,750
That's quite a view.

210
00:27:12,043 --> 00:27:13,586
Yes, it is.

211
00:27:15,254 --> 00:27:17,089
Quite a view.

212
00:28:51,434 --> 00:28:53,561
''Dear Mr Brian Boyd,

213
00:28:53,644 --> 00:28:55,396
''no doubt you have
received information...''

214
00:28:55,479 --> 00:28:56,689
''Dear Mrs Jensen...''

215
00:28:56,772 --> 00:28:58,357
''..the death of your son.''

216
00:28:58,441 --> 00:29:00,151
''..no words
can relieve the grief...''

217
00:29:00,234 --> 00:29:02,528
''We have felt his loss
tremendously.''

218
00:29:02,612 --> 00:29:05,573
''He was a fine soldier...''

219
00:29:05,656 --> 00:29:07,283
''We were involved

220
00:29:07,366 --> 00:29:10,536
''in one of the most important
operations of this war.''

221
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:12,580
''Al held us all together.

222
00:29:12,663 --> 00:29:14,373
''He was always
first to volunteer...''

223
00:29:14,457 --> 00:29:16,167
''..came to a clearing

224
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:17,919
''where 4,000 troops had passed.''

225
00:29:18,002 --> 00:29:20,504
''Your husband served in a unit

226
00:29:20,588 --> 00:29:23,132
''whose dangerous duty is
to place itself beyond...''

227
00:29:23,215 --> 00:29:26,135
''..we all cherish
and hold so dear.

228
00:29:26,218 --> 00:29:30,139
''The loss of Lee and others
like him is a distinct blow.''

229
00:29:30,222 --> 00:29:32,308
''l understand your desire

230
00:29:32,391 --> 00:29:36,145
''to learn about circumstances
leading to his death.''

231
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:31,492
Colonel, l've got something
you should know about.

232
00:30:33,244 --> 00:30:36,581
These two men died in Normandy.

233
00:30:36,664 --> 00:30:38,583
This one at Omaha beach.

234
00:30:39,625 --> 00:30:41,043
Sean Ryan.

235
00:30:41,127 --> 00:30:43,379
This man at Utah.

236
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:46,215
Peter Ryan.

237
00:30:50,011 --> 00:30:53,180
This man was killed
last week in New Guinea.

238
00:30:55,850 --> 00:30:57,351
Daniel...

239
00:30:57,435 --> 00:30:58,728
Ryan.

240
00:30:58,811 --> 00:31:00,605
The three are brothers, sir.

241
00:31:00,688 --> 00:31:02,607
l've just learned
that this afternoon

242
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:05,151
their mother will get
all three telegrams.

243
00:31:09,447 --> 00:31:11,741
That's not all.
There's a fourth brother.

244
00:31:11,824 --> 00:31:15,578
He parachuted in the night
before the invasion.

245
00:31:15,661 --> 00:31:17,538
He's somewhere in Normandy.

246
00:31:17,622 --> 00:31:20,917
- ls he alive?
- We don't know.

247
00:31:23,669 --> 00:31:24,921
Come with me.

248
00:33:09,859 --> 00:33:12,403
'Goddamit.'

249
00:33:12,486 --> 00:33:16,782
All four were in the 29th
Division, but we split them up

250
00:33:16,866 --> 00:33:19,827
after the Sullivan brothers died
on the Juneau.

251
00:33:19,911 --> 00:33:22,121
Any contact
with the fourth son, James?

252
00:33:22,204 --> 00:33:26,542
No, sir. He was dropped about
15 miles inland near Neuville.

253
00:33:26,626 --> 00:33:28,544
That's still deep
behind German lines.

254
00:33:28,628 --> 00:33:32,548
There's no way to know
where the hell he was dropped.

255
00:33:32,632 --> 00:33:37,136
First reports out of SHAEF said
the 101st is scattered to hell.

256
00:33:37,219 --> 00:33:39,180
There's misdrops
all over Normandy.

257
00:33:39,263 --> 00:33:42,892
Assuming Ryan survived
the jump, he could be anywhere.

258
00:33:42,975 --> 00:33:45,519
ln fact, he's probably KlA.

259
00:33:45,603 --> 00:33:49,523
And frankly, sir, we go sending
some sort of rescue mission,

260
00:33:49,607 --> 00:33:52,401
flat-hatting through swarms
of German reinforcements

261
00:33:52,485 --> 00:33:54,153
along our axis of advance,

262
00:33:54,237 --> 00:33:56,030
they're gonna be KlA, too.

263
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:21,180
l have a letter here...

264
00:34:22,431 --> 00:34:26,560
written a long time ago
to a Mrs Bixby in Boston.

265
00:34:26,644 --> 00:34:28,771
So bear with me.

266
00:34:31,357 --> 00:34:32,817
''Dear Madam,

267
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:36,821
''l have been shown in the files
of the War Department

268
00:34:36,904 --> 00:34:40,199
''a statement of the Adjutant
General of Massachusetts

269
00:34:40,283 --> 00:34:43,578
''that you are the mother
of five...

270
00:34:45,621 --> 00:34:49,208
''sons who died gloriously
on the field of battle.

271
00:34:52,295 --> 00:34:57,341
''l feel how weak and fruitless
must be any words of mine

272
00:34:57,425 --> 00:35:00,469
''that would attempt
to beguile you from the grief

273
00:35:00,553 --> 00:35:04,557
''of a loss so overwhelming.

274
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:07,143
''But l cannot refrain
from tendering to you

275
00:35:07,226 --> 00:35:10,563

276
00:35:10,646 --> 00:35:15,192
''in the thanks of the republic

277
00:35:18,487 --> 00:35:20,531
''l pray that
Our Heavenly Father

278
00:35:20,615 --> 00:35:23,534

279
00:35:23,618 --> 00:35:27,997
''and leave only the cherished
memory of the loved lost...

280
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:30,750
''and the solemn pride

281
00:35:30,833 --> 00:35:33,169
''to have laid so costly

282
00:35:33,252 --> 00:35:35,129

00:35:35,212 --> 00:35:38,591
''Yours very sincerely

00:35:38,674 --> 00:35:40,092
''Abraham Lincoln.''

285
00:35:59,654 --> 00:36:02,365
That boy is alive.

286
00:36:02,448 --> 00:36:05,326
We are gonna send somebody
to find him...

287
00:36:06,244 --> 00:36:10,122
and we are gonna get him
the hell out of there.

288
00:36:10,206 --> 00:36:11,207
Yes, sir.

289
00:36:24,136 --> 00:36:27,014
We expected 32 tanks,
27 didn't make it.

290
00:36:27,098 --> 00:36:30,476
- Miller, Charlie Company.
- Go in, Captain.

291
00:36:30,559 --> 00:36:33,771
lf we don't off-load
those Shermans by 0600,

292
00:36:33,854 --> 00:36:36,482
we'll have an entire division
stuck at Carentan

293
00:36:36,566 --> 00:36:38,526
with its pants
around its ankles.

294
00:36:38,609 --> 00:36:40,570
Well, you let me know.

295
00:36:40,653 --> 00:36:44,323
Have Charlie Company hold
Vierville until we get there.

296
00:36:44,407 --> 00:36:46,617
Yes, sir. Runner!

297
00:36:51,872 --> 00:36:55,459
Airborne was supposed
to win an open door for us.

298
00:36:55,543 --> 00:36:58,379
They misdropped, scattered
everything into the wind.

299
00:36:58,462 --> 00:36:59,547
What's your situation?

300
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:02,133
Yes, sir. Sector four is secure.

301
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:06,470
We took out towed 88s

302
00:37:06,554 --> 00:37:09,307
here, here...and here.

303
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:11,058
They'd already gotten
four Shermans

304
00:37:11,142 --> 00:37:13,144
and some deuce-and-a-halves.

305
00:37:13,227 --> 00:37:15,563
These two minefields
are one big one.

306
00:37:15,646 --> 00:37:17,064
We tried going through,

307
00:37:17,148 --> 00:37:20,151
but it turned
into a high-density field...

308
00:37:20,234 --> 00:37:21,569
little bit of everything.

309
00:37:21,652 --> 00:37:24,363
Spreng mine 44s,
pot mines, A-200s...

310
00:37:24,447 --> 00:37:28,576
the wooden bastards that the
mine detectors don't pick up.

311
00:37:28,659 --> 00:37:32,538
This road here...
they placed Teller mine 43s,

312
00:37:32,622 --> 00:37:34,373
l guess for our tanks...

313
00:37:34,457 --> 00:37:37,501
from here
to the edge of the village.

314
00:37:37,585 --> 00:37:40,212
So we marked 'em,
called the engineers.

315
00:37:40,296 --> 00:37:41,589
Resistance?

316
00:37:41,672 --> 00:37:43,549
We had higher
support expectations, sir.

317
00:37:43,633 --> 00:37:46,177
There was an understrength
company without artillery.

318
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:49,430
Wehrmacht 346 lnfantry,
von Luck Kampfgruppe.

319
00:37:49,513 --> 00:37:51,557
We ended up with 23 prisoners.

320
00:37:51,641 --> 00:37:53,809
We turned them over to MPs.

321
00:37:57,647 --> 00:37:59,607
What about our casualties?

322
00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:01,817
Well...

323
00:38:01,901 --> 00:38:03,569
the figures...

324
00:38:03,653 --> 00:38:06,155
were 35 dead...

325
00:38:06,239 --> 00:38:07,531
times two wounded.

326
00:38:07,615 --> 00:38:12,578
They just...
didn't wanna give up those 88s.

327
00:38:12,662 --> 00:38:15,539
lt was tough,
that's why you got it.

328
00:38:15,623 --> 00:38:17,166
Yes, sir.

329
00:38:18,417 --> 00:38:19,543
John...

330
00:38:22,546 --> 00:38:24,799
l've got another one for you.

331
00:38:24,882 --> 00:38:27,969
- Yes, sir.
- Straight from the top.

332
00:38:34,267 --> 00:38:38,563
We're taking a squad to Neuville
on a public relations mission.

333
00:38:38,646 --> 00:38:40,606
You leading a squad?

334
00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:45,570
Some Private lost three brothers
and got a ticket home.

335
00:38:45,653 --> 00:38:46,946
How come Neuville?

336
00:38:47,029 --> 00:38:50,575
They think he's part
of all those airborne misdrops.

337
00:38:50,658 --> 00:38:54,453
lt won't be easy finding one
particular soldier.

338
00:38:54,537 --> 00:38:57,206
Like finding a needle
in a stack of needles.

339
00:38:57,290 --> 00:38:58,749
What about the company?

340
00:38:58,833 --> 00:39:02,545
We take our pick,
the rest get folded into Baker.

341
00:39:02,628 --> 00:39:04,213
Jesus Christ.

342
00:39:04,297 --> 00:39:06,591
They took away your company?

343
00:39:06,674 --> 00:39:10,803
lt wasn't my company. lt was
the army's. So they told me.

344
00:39:10,886 --> 00:39:14,557
Give me Reiben on BAR, Jackson,
Wade, Beasley and Caparzo.

345
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,350
Beasley's dead.

346
00:39:16,434 --> 00:39:19,645
All right, Mellish, then.
We got anybody speaks French?

347
00:39:19,729 --> 00:39:22,189
Not that l know of.

348
00:39:22,273 --> 00:39:23,524
What about Talbot?

349
00:39:23,608 --> 00:39:25,943
- This morning.
- Oh. All right.

350
00:39:26,027 --> 00:39:28,571
l'll try to dig up
another interpreter.

351
00:39:28,654 --> 00:39:30,740
Assemble
at battalion motor pool.

352
00:39:30,823 --> 00:39:31,782
Yes, sir.

353
00:39:31,866 --> 00:39:34,160
- What we doing?
- Listen up... What?

354
00:39:34,243 --> 00:39:35,536
What we gonna do?

355
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:39,373
You're going home with a hunk
of cheese in your ass, Caparzo.

356
00:39:39,457 --> 00:39:42,209
You like it in the ass.

357
00:39:42,293 --> 00:39:44,170
Attention!

358
00:39:44,253 --> 00:39:45,588
As you were.

359
00:39:45,671 --> 00:39:47,381
l'm looking for Corporal Upham,

360
00:39:47,465 --> 00:39:49,634
- Timothy E.
- l'm Upham, sir.

361
00:39:49,717 --> 00:39:52,303
- You speak French and German?
- Yes, sir.

362
00:39:52,386 --> 00:39:53,346
Accent?

363
00:39:53,429 --> 00:39:56,307
A slight one in French.
My German's clean, sir.

364
00:39:56,390 --> 00:39:58,976
You're reassigned to me.
Grab your gear.

365
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:01,938
We're going to Neuville.
When was this updated?

366
00:40:02,021 --> 00:40:03,856
As of 0830, sir.

367
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:05,399
Uh, sir...

368
00:40:05,483 --> 00:40:07,151
These two axes advance south...

369
00:40:07,235 --> 00:40:09,153
Sir, there are Germans
in Neuville.

370
00:40:09,237 --> 00:40:14,742
- Yes, Corporal.
- Sir, a LOT of Germans.

371
00:40:14,825 --> 00:40:16,327
You have a problem
with that, Corporal?

372
00:40:16,410 --> 00:40:20,706
No, l've never been in combat.
l make maps, translate...

373
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:23,709
l need someone who speaks
French and German.

374
00:40:23,793 --> 00:40:25,044
My guys were killed.

375
00:40:25,127 --> 00:40:28,047
But l haven't held a weapon
since training, sir.

376
00:40:28,130 --> 00:40:31,467
- Did you fire the weapon?
- Yes, sir.

377
00:40:31,550 --> 00:40:34,053
- Then get your gear.
- Yes, sir.

378
00:40:35,763 --> 00:40:37,390
Sir, may l...

379
00:40:42,103 --> 00:40:44,480
May l bring my typewriter, sir?

380
00:40:48,859 --> 00:40:49,902
Yes, sir.

381
00:40:53,573 --> 00:40:56,075
Thank you very much, sir.

382
00:40:56,158 --> 00:40:58,661
- That a souvenir?
- No, sir.

383
00:40:58,744 --> 00:41:00,371
Take your time, Corporal.

384
00:41:03,874 --> 00:41:06,460
Look on the bright side,
Corporal.

385
00:41:06,544 --> 00:41:07,712
Yes, sir.

386
00:41:07,795 --> 00:41:11,716
For one thing...
you don't need to carry those.

387
00:41:11,799 --> 00:41:13,134
You'll need that.

388
00:41:13,217 --> 00:41:16,053
Need this. Yes, sir.
Don't need that...

389
00:42:15,112 --> 00:42:16,989
You want your head blown off?

390
00:42:17,073 --> 00:42:20,034
Don't fuckin' touch me
with those little rat claws.

391
00:42:20,117 --> 00:42:22,370
Get the fuck back in formation.

392
00:42:23,537 --> 00:42:26,249
l was wondering
where you're from, that's...

393
00:42:31,504 --> 00:42:33,047
Caparzo, is it?

394
00:42:33,130 --> 00:42:34,632
Hey, drop dead, Corporal.

395
00:42:34,715 --> 00:42:35,841
Got you.

396
00:42:35,925 --> 00:42:40,429
And saluting the captain
makes him a target for Germans.

397
00:42:40,513 --> 00:42:43,891
So don't do it, especially
when l'm next to him.

398
00:42:46,102 --> 00:42:47,645
Corporal, what's
your book about?

399
00:42:47,728 --> 00:42:50,273
- Watch your rifle.
- Sorry.

400
00:42:50,356 --> 00:42:52,984
lt's supposed to be about
the bonds of brotherhood

401
00:42:53,067 --> 00:42:55,027
that develop between
soldiers during war.

402
00:42:55,111 --> 00:42:57,113
Brotherhood?

403
00:42:57,196 --> 00:42:58,990
What do you know
about brotherhood?

404
00:42:59,073 --> 00:43:01,576
Get a load of this guy, Fish.

405
00:43:01,659 --> 00:43:03,911
Ask the captain where he's from.

406
00:43:03,995 --> 00:43:05,454
Yeah, ask the captain.

407
00:43:05,538 --> 00:43:07,540
He'll tell you everything
you wanna know.

408
00:43:07,623 --> 00:43:10,418
You wanna explain
the math of this to me?

409
00:43:10,501 --> 00:43:15,047
Why risk the lives of the
eight of us to save one guy?

410
00:43:15,131 --> 00:43:17,800
20 degrees.
Anybody wanna answer?

411
00:43:17,883 --> 00:43:21,554
Reiben, think about
the poor bastard's mother.

412
00:43:21,637 --> 00:43:23,431
l got a mother, all right?

413
00:43:23,514 --> 00:43:26,017
l mean, you got a mother.
Sarge has got a mother.

414
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:29,312
Shit, l bet even
the captain's got a mother.

415
00:43:29,395 --> 00:43:32,440
Well, not the captain,
but the rest of us.

416
00:43:32,523 --> 00:43:35,943
''Theirs not to reason why,
theirs but to do and die.''

417
00:43:38,487 --> 00:43:41,616
What does that mean?
We're all supposed to die?

418
00:43:41,699 --> 00:43:44,619
Upham's talking about
our duty as soldiers.

419
00:43:44,702 --> 00:43:45,995
Yes, sir.

420
00:43:46,078 --> 00:43:48,664
We have orders to follow.
That supersedes everything,

421
00:43:48,748 --> 00:43:50,124
including your mothers.

422
00:43:50,207 --> 00:43:51,500
Thank you, sir.

423
00:43:51,584 --> 00:43:54,003
Even if you think
the mission's fubar, sir?

424
00:43:54,086 --> 00:43:56,756
Especially if you think
the mission's fubar.

425
00:43:56,839 --> 00:43:58,341
What's ''fubar''?

426
00:43:58,424 --> 00:44:01,135
Oh, it's German. Yeah.

427
00:44:01,218 --> 00:44:03,471
Never heard of that.

428
00:44:03,554 --> 00:44:05,014
Sir...

429
00:44:05,097 --> 00:44:07,391
l have an opinion
on this matter.

430
00:44:07,475 --> 00:44:10,436
Well, by all means,
share it with the squad.

431
00:44:10,519 --> 00:44:12,647
Well, from my way
of thinking, sir,

432
00:44:12,730 --> 00:44:15,441
this entire mission is
a serious misallocation

433
00:44:15,524 --> 00:44:17,443
of valuable military resources.

434
00:44:17,526 --> 00:44:19,237
Yeah. Go on.

435
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:21,405
Well, it seems to me, sir,

436
00:44:21,489 --> 00:44:24,867
that God made me
a fine instrument of warfare.

437
00:44:25,910 --> 00:44:28,996
Reiben, pay attention.
This is the way to gripe!

438
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:30,039
Continue, Jackson.

439
00:44:30,122 --> 00:44:31,415
What l mean, sir,

440
00:44:31,499 --> 00:44:36,545
if you put me and this rifle
within one mile of Adolf Hitler

441
00:44:36,629 --> 00:44:39,048
with a clear line
of sight, sir...

442
00:44:39,131 --> 00:44:42,510
Pack your bags, fellas.
War's over. Amen.

443
00:44:42,593 --> 00:44:44,053
Oh, that's brilliant,
bumpkin.

444
00:44:44,136 --> 00:44:47,431
So, Captain, what about you?
You don't gripe at all?

445
00:44:47,515 --> 00:44:50,434
l don't gripe to you,
Reiben. l'm a captain.

446
00:44:50,518 --> 00:44:53,688
There's a chain of command.
Gripes go up, not down.

447
00:44:53,771 --> 00:44:58,526
You gripe to me, l gripe
to my superiors and so on.

448
00:44:58,609 --> 00:45:02,488
l don't gripe to you
or in front of you.

449
00:45:02,572 --> 00:45:04,448
l'm sorry, sir, but, uh...

450
00:45:04,532 --> 00:45:09,036
Let's say you weren't a captain.
What would you say then?

451
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:10,454
Well, in that case,

452
00:45:10,538 --> 00:45:13,416
l'd say this is
an excellent mission, sir,

453
00:45:13,499 --> 00:45:15,418
with an extremely valuable
objective, sir,

454
00:45:15,501 --> 00:45:18,045
worthy of
my best efforts, sir.

455
00:45:18,129 --> 00:45:20,631
Moreover...l feel
heartfelt sorrow

456
00:45:20,715 --> 00:45:23,426
for the mother
of Private James Ryan

457
00:45:23,509 --> 00:45:27,805
and will lay down my life
and the lives of my men,

458
00:45:27,888 --> 00:45:30,975
especially you, Reiben,
to ease her suffering.

459
00:45:32,059 --> 00:45:34,562
- He's good.
- l love him.

460
00:45:44,906 --> 00:45:46,032
Right.

461
00:46:27,907 --> 00:46:29,617
Thunder!

462
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:31,035
Flash!

463
00:46:31,118 --> 00:46:32,411
Upham, over there.

464
00:46:32,495 --> 00:46:34,497
Reiben, you four go.

465
00:46:44,131 --> 00:46:45,758
Go, go, go, go, go.

466
00:46:51,138 --> 00:46:52,807
You're a welcome sight.

467
00:46:52,890 --> 00:46:54,392
Our relief showed up.

468
00:46:54,475 --> 00:46:56,018
How many are you?

469
00:46:56,102 --> 00:46:58,521
Just eight. We're not
your relief. Sorry.

470
00:46:58,604 --> 00:47:00,398
What do you mean, sir?

471
00:47:00,481 --> 00:47:02,441
We're here for a Private Ryan.

472
00:47:02,525 --> 00:47:04,235
Who? Ryan? What for?

473
00:47:04,318 --> 00:47:06,737
- ls he here?
- l don't know.

474
00:47:06,821 --> 00:47:12,785
Maybe on the other side of town.
The Germans cut us in two.

475
00:47:12,868 --> 00:47:16,622
- What's his name again?
- Ryan. James Ryan.

476
00:47:16,706 --> 00:47:18,040
He dropped in with 101st.

477
00:47:18,124 --> 00:47:20,835
- Goldman, get me a runner.
- Runner!

478
00:47:20,918 --> 00:47:22,253
Come on.

479
00:47:26,507 --> 00:47:28,467
Jonesy, make a hole there!

480
00:47:29,969 --> 00:47:33,431
We got stopped by intense rifle
action from the eastward.

481
00:47:33,514 --> 00:47:36,392
The Germans have been
reinforcing regiments all day.

482
00:47:36,475 --> 00:47:38,895
lt's been quiet
for about 45 minutes.

483
00:47:38,978 --> 00:47:42,398
Most of the German fire
is concentrated to the westward.

484
00:47:42,481 --> 00:47:44,025
Who's on the loudspeaker?

485
00:47:44,108 --> 00:47:45,443
That's Dagwood Düsseldorf,

486
00:47:45,526 --> 00:47:48,195
our friendly neighbourhood
morale officer.

487
00:47:48,279 --> 00:47:50,406
The Statue of Liberty is kaputt.

488
00:47:50,489 --> 00:47:54,035
''The Statue of Liberty
is kaputt.''

489
00:47:54,118 --> 00:47:55,661
That's disconcerting.

490
00:47:58,915 --> 00:48:00,416
Take the second left...

491
00:48:00,499 --> 00:48:04,420
Your father was circumcised
by my rabbi, you prick!

492
00:48:04,503 --> 00:48:07,423
Private Ryan, James,
probably misdropped with 101 .

493
00:48:07,506 --> 00:48:09,425
- Got that?
- Cover!

494
00:48:16,891 --> 00:48:18,267
Go!

495
00:48:41,916 --> 00:48:43,709
Those sadistic fuckin' animals!

496
00:48:43,793 --> 00:48:44,752
Get down.

497
00:48:44,835 --> 00:48:48,005
They know we're not in contact,
they'll get the runners.

498
00:48:48,089 --> 00:48:49,590
Why keep shooting him?

499
00:48:49,674 --> 00:48:52,426
Long as he lives,
he carries the message.

500
00:48:52,510 --> 00:48:55,012
- We'd do the same.
- We wouldn't!

501
00:48:55,096 --> 00:48:58,683
- Get ready to travel.
- Yes, sir.

502
00:48:58,766 --> 00:49:02,061
Try again to let Captain Hamill
know we're coming.

503
00:49:02,144 --> 00:49:03,437
What's the rest
of Neuville like?

504
00:49:03,521 --> 00:49:07,400
Uh, next block's got
two-storey buildings both sides.

505
00:49:07,483 --> 00:49:10,778
A lotta windows
and a square on the left.

506
00:49:10,861 --> 00:49:13,322
- Show me.
- Sarge, hold right here.

507
00:49:13,406 --> 00:49:14,448
Yes, sir.

508
00:49:18,494 --> 00:49:21,998
Let's stay out of this enfilade
and use the buildings.

509
00:49:22,081 --> 00:49:25,042
Try a left hook.
Two of yours, two of mine.

510
00:49:25,126 --> 00:49:27,169
Hastings, Goldman, up front!

511
00:49:28,504 --> 00:49:29,839
Reiben, Caparzo.

512
00:49:29,922 --> 00:49:31,757
Fundamentals. Short runs.

513
00:49:31,841 --> 00:49:34,260
High and low at the corners.

514
00:49:34,343 --> 00:49:36,637
Be prepared for close contact.

515
00:49:36,721 --> 00:49:40,016
Go. Upham,
stay with Sergeant Horvath.

516
00:49:40,099 --> 00:49:41,225
Stay right here.

517
00:49:41,309 --> 00:49:43,019
l'll wear him like underwear!

518
00:49:43,102 --> 00:49:44,186
Stay with me.

519
00:49:52,528 --> 00:49:55,615
Past the end
are the gates to the square.

520
00:49:55,698 --> 00:49:56,699
Good.

521
00:50:04,540 --> 00:50:06,208
Reiben,
where's the Captain from?

522
00:50:06,292 --> 00:50:09,045
Figure that out,
you got yourself a prize.

523
00:50:09,128 --> 00:50:10,463
300 bucks, l heard.

524
00:50:10,546 --> 00:50:14,175
Company's got a pool.
Five bucks gets you in.

525
00:50:17,553 --> 00:50:18,971
Easy.

526
00:50:20,556 --> 00:50:24,352
lt's around this corner.
Defilade up to those gates.

527
00:50:26,145 --> 00:50:28,314
Somebody must know
where he's from.

528
00:50:28,397 --> 00:50:31,817
Been with him since Kasserine
Pass, and l don't know.

529
00:50:31,901 --> 00:50:33,444
My ankles are killing me.

530
00:50:33,527 --> 00:50:36,405
l'll need a wheelchair
before this is over.

531
00:50:36,489 --> 00:50:39,033
Ow! That's it. Oh, my God.

532
00:50:39,116 --> 00:50:41,035
Got ankles like an old woman.

533
00:50:41,118 --> 00:50:42,411
Like an old...

534
00:50:45,539 --> 00:50:46,832
Reiben.

535
00:50:46,916 --> 00:50:49,043
So you don't even know
where he went to school?

536
00:50:49,126 --> 00:50:51,045
Captain didn't go to school,

537
00:50:51,128 --> 00:50:53,965
they assembled him
out of Gl body parts.

538
00:50:54,048 --> 00:50:55,424
Pay attention to detail.

539
00:50:55,508 --> 00:50:59,011
l know where he's from 'cause
l pay attention to detail.

540
00:50:59,095 --> 00:51:00,429
Hey, Upham...

541
00:51:00,513 --> 00:51:03,140
careful you don't step
in the bullshit.

542
00:51:08,312 --> 00:51:09,397
Do it.

543
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:10,439
Thunder!

544
00:51:10,523 --> 00:51:13,025
Thunder, or we will fire on you!

545
00:51:23,286 --> 00:51:25,413
Upham, tell them
to show themselves.

546
00:51:38,342 --> 00:51:41,220
Ask where the Germans are.

547
00:51:45,516 --> 00:51:47,018
What's he saying?

548
00:51:47,101 --> 00:51:48,394
The children.

549
00:51:48,477 --> 00:51:49,562
Take the children.

550
00:51:49,645 --> 00:51:52,148
No, we can't take the kids.

551
00:51:53,482 --> 00:51:56,235
We can't take the kids! No!

552
00:51:58,487 --> 00:52:01,407
They think
they'll be safe with us.

553
00:52:01,490 --> 00:52:04,201
lt's not gonna be safe with us!

554
00:52:04,285 --> 00:52:06,996
Are you nuts?!
Listen to the Captain!

555
00:52:07,079 --> 00:52:09,498
They think
they'll be safe, sir.

556
00:52:09,582 --> 00:52:11,459
Not gonna be safe anywhere.

557
00:52:13,210 --> 00:52:14,420
Put that kid back!

558
00:52:17,548 --> 00:52:19,842
Put that little girl back!

559
00:52:19,926 --> 00:52:22,011
Caparzo,
give that kid back now!

560
00:52:22,094 --> 00:52:24,847
Upham, how do you say
''lt's OK''?

561
00:52:24,931 --> 00:52:27,058
She reminds me of my niece, sir.

562
00:52:27,141 --> 00:52:29,018
Get the kid back up there!

563
00:52:29,101 --> 00:52:32,939
Captain, we could take her
down the road to the next town.

564
00:52:33,022 --> 00:52:34,440
We're not here
to do the decent thing!

565
00:52:34,523 --> 00:52:36,150
We're here to follow
fuckin' orders!

566
00:52:36,234 --> 00:52:38,236
Sarge, take this goddamn kid!

567
00:52:39,570 --> 00:52:42,365
Cover! Cover!

568
00:52:49,747 --> 00:52:51,082
Come on. No!

569
00:52:51,165 --> 00:52:53,125
Goddamit!
Where'd that come from?

570
00:52:55,503 --> 00:52:57,880
He was on the ground
before we heard.

571
00:53:03,886 --> 00:53:05,263
That's where l'd be.

572
00:53:07,515 --> 00:53:08,808
l didn't see it.

573
00:53:08,891 --> 00:53:11,435
450 yards, Captain.
Maybe a shade under.

574
00:53:11,519 --> 00:53:13,437
l wouldn't venture
out there, fellas!

575
00:53:13,521 --> 00:53:15,898
This sniper's got talent!

576
00:53:20,444 --> 00:53:24,031
Please don't cry. l'll take you
back to your parents.

577
00:53:24,115 --> 00:53:26,075
Please don't cry. Come on.

578
00:53:41,924 --> 00:53:42,883
Captain.

579
00:53:42,967 --> 00:53:45,261
Hold on, Caparzo.

580
00:53:45,344 --> 00:53:46,429
Help me up.

581
00:53:46,512 --> 00:53:48,180
l can walk. l can walk.

582
00:53:48,264 --> 00:53:49,974
Caparzo, stay still!

583
00:53:57,899 --> 00:53:59,275
All right.

584
00:54:01,527 --> 00:54:04,280
Two clicks, left wind.

585
00:54:16,542 --> 00:54:19,712
Captain, can you see him
from there? How is he?

586
00:54:19,795 --> 00:54:22,006
Wade, you stay put.

587
00:54:22,089 --> 00:54:23,507
Where's he shot, Captain?

588
00:54:25,635 --> 00:54:28,471
- Can you see him?
- Stay there!

589
00:54:28,554 --> 00:54:31,015
Damn it, stay down!

590
00:54:31,098 --> 00:54:32,433
What's up with you?

591
00:54:32,516 --> 00:54:35,853
What if you get hit? Huh?

592
00:54:35,937 --> 00:54:37,897
Fish, come over here.

593
00:54:37,980 --> 00:54:39,815
Carpy, put your head down.

594
00:54:39,899 --> 00:54:41,651
Put your head down.

595
00:54:50,159 --> 00:54:53,204
O my God, l trust in Thee.

596
00:54:53,287 --> 00:54:56,249
Let me not be ashamed.

597
00:54:56,332 --> 00:54:59,377
Let not my enemies
triumph over me.

598
00:55:08,552 --> 00:55:10,429
Copy it.

599
00:55:10,513 --> 00:55:12,890
Copy it and send it for me.

600
00:55:12,974 --> 00:55:15,393
You're gonna send it.
Put it down!

601
00:55:15,476 --> 00:55:17,812
- lt's got blood!
- l see it.

602
00:55:22,567 --> 00:55:25,653
lt's... lt's to my dad.

603
00:55:25,736 --> 00:55:27,321
lt's got blood on it.

604
00:55:55,683 --> 00:55:56,976
We got him.

605
00:55:57,059 --> 00:55:58,102
Stay down.

606
00:56:06,110 --> 00:56:07,987
How bad is it?

607
00:56:08,070 --> 00:56:10,364
Chest, maybe lung shot.

608
00:56:26,589 --> 00:56:28,507
Get that 30 up the street!

609
00:56:33,512 --> 00:56:35,014
Detail!

610
00:56:35,097 --> 00:56:36,432
Clear up!

611
00:56:36,515 --> 00:56:38,100
Clear down!

612
00:56:52,740 --> 00:56:54,909
That's why
we can't take children.

613
00:57:01,499 --> 00:57:05,044
Sergeant Horvath,
do an ammo check.

614
00:57:05,127 --> 00:57:07,838
Upham... canteens.

615
00:57:07,922 --> 00:57:09,173
Fill 'em up.

616
00:57:09,257 --> 00:57:11,467
- Sergeant Hill.
- Yes, sir.

617
00:57:11,550 --> 00:57:15,930
Gather your men. We'll form up
at the north-west corner.

618
00:57:18,182 --> 00:57:20,977
Mellish, check the tower.

619
00:57:21,060 --> 00:57:22,478
Right now. Go!

620
00:57:34,323 --> 00:57:35,700
Fuck Ryan.

621
00:57:46,544 --> 00:57:49,046
- Thunder!
- Flash!

622
00:57:49,130 --> 00:57:50,464
Come on in.

623
00:57:55,511 --> 00:57:57,638
Hey, guys, we're looking
for Captain Hamill.

624
00:57:57,722 --> 00:57:59,473
Somewhere across the square.

625
00:57:59,557 --> 00:58:01,058
Across the square.

626
00:58:01,142 --> 00:58:03,436
Go easy. Watch for snipers.

627
00:58:03,519 --> 00:58:05,521
Take it easy. Sit down.

628
00:58:21,913 --> 00:58:25,082
Jimmy T, find Captain Hamill,
bring him in here.

629
00:58:25,166 --> 00:58:26,417
What? Up there?

630
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:29,462
How should l know?
Would you go look, please?

631
00:58:29,545 --> 00:58:30,880
Thank you, you moron.

632
00:58:32,715 --> 00:58:34,467
All right.

633
00:58:34,550 --> 00:58:38,179
You guys just flake out
here for a while.

634
00:58:39,722 --> 00:58:42,516
Let me get this goddamn
hitchhiker out of my boot.

635
00:58:51,192 --> 00:58:52,652
Jesus!

636
00:58:52,735 --> 00:58:54,862
Drop your weapons!

637
00:58:54,946 --> 00:58:56,072
Drop 'em now!

638
00:58:56,155 --> 00:58:57,448
Drop the fucking weapons!

639
00:59:01,410 --> 00:59:03,287
l'll shoot you! l'll shoot!

640
00:59:03,371 --> 00:59:04,914
Drop! Drop! Drop 'em!

641
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,794
Now! Put 'em down!

642
00:59:25,142 --> 00:59:26,477
Clear up!

643
00:59:31,524 --> 00:59:32,650
Shit.

644
00:59:32,733 --> 00:59:34,277
Shit!

645
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:35,695
Clear up!

646
00:59:36,946 --> 00:59:38,489
Clear down!

647
00:59:50,918 --> 00:59:52,587
Enough to make you old.

648
00:59:53,754 --> 00:59:55,131
Let's hope so.

649
01:00:05,016 --> 01:00:06,434
Fred Hamill, Pathfinders 101st.

650
01:00:06,517 --> 01:00:08,436
John Miller, 2nd Rangers.

651
01:00:08,519 --> 01:00:10,563
Thank you.

652
01:00:10,646 --> 01:00:12,899
We're looking for
Private James Ryan.

653
01:00:12,982 --> 01:00:16,777
He's part of your outfit.
Any chance you policed him up?

654
01:00:16,861 --> 01:00:20,072
- How was the road in?
- Scenic.

655
01:00:20,156 --> 01:00:22,158
We lost most of our ammo.

656
01:00:22,241 --> 01:00:24,410
And one of our men.

657
01:00:24,493 --> 01:00:27,830
Lieutenant, redeploy that
bazooka to the right side.

658
01:00:27,914 --> 01:00:29,040
Yes, sir!

659
01:00:29,123 --> 01:00:31,042
And get Ryan up here.

660
01:00:32,543 --> 01:00:34,003
Ryan!

661
01:00:34,086 --> 01:00:36,422
Ryan, front and centre!

662
01:00:36,505 --> 01:00:38,174
Ryan!

663
01:00:41,552 --> 01:00:43,012
Here comes our boy.

664
01:00:50,353 --> 01:00:52,480
Told you he was an asshole.

665
01:00:54,815 --> 01:00:56,442
Sir, Private Ryan reporting.

666
01:00:56,525 --> 01:00:58,027
At ease.

667
01:00:58,110 --> 01:01:01,614
Captain Miller, 2nd Rangers.
He wants a word with you.

668
01:01:03,324 --> 01:01:05,451
This way.

669
01:01:05,534 --> 01:01:07,036
All right.

670
01:01:07,119 --> 01:01:08,496
Take a knee.

671
01:01:17,588 --> 01:01:20,258
Private, l have some bad news.

672
01:01:28,641 --> 01:01:32,770
Well, there isn't any easy
way to say this, so, uh...

673
01:01:34,605 --> 01:01:38,442
so l'll just say it -
your brothers are dead.

674
01:01:38,526 --> 01:01:44,282
We have, uh, orders
to come get you...

675
01:01:44,365 --> 01:01:45,866
'cause you're going home.

676
01:02:00,298 --> 01:02:02,800
Oh, my God.
My brothers are dead.

677
01:02:08,764 --> 01:02:12,894
l was gonna take 'em fishing
when we got home.

678
01:02:28,117 --> 01:02:29,619
l'm so sorry, James.

679
01:02:29,702 --> 01:02:32,163
l can't tell you how much.

680
01:02:32,246 --> 01:02:35,041
How...how did they die?

681
01:02:35,124 --> 01:02:38,002
They were killed in action.

682
01:02:38,085 --> 01:02:42,214
No, that can't be.
They're both...

683
01:02:42,298 --> 01:02:44,425
That...that can't be.

684
01:02:44,508 --> 01:02:48,471
My brothers are still
in grammar school.

685
01:02:50,097 --> 01:02:52,141
You're James Ryan?

686
01:02:52,225 --> 01:02:53,893
Yeah.

687
01:02:53,976 --> 01:02:57,188
James Francis Ryan from lowa?

688
01:02:57,271 --> 01:03:00,066
James Frederick Ryan, Minnesota.

689
01:03:05,738 --> 01:03:09,116
Well, does that...does that
mean my brothers are OK?

690
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:11,035
Yeah, l'm sure they're fine.

691
01:03:11,118 --> 01:03:13,079
Are you sure they're OK,
though?

692
01:03:13,162 --> 01:03:16,123
We're looking for
a different Private Ryan.

693
01:03:16,207 --> 01:03:18,000
How do you know?

694
01:03:18,084 --> 01:03:20,253
How do you know the foul-up

695
01:03:20,336 --> 01:03:22,880
isn't that his brothers
are OK and that...

696
01:03:22,964 --> 01:03:25,174
Lieutenant,
l'm sorry for the trouble.

697
01:03:25,258 --> 01:03:30,096
l just wrote them a letter...
l got to get home.

698
01:03:30,179 --> 01:03:33,849
l got to get home right now.

699
01:03:33,933 --> 01:03:35,560
Shh, take it easy.

700
01:03:35,643 --> 01:03:37,979
- Where's our Ryan?
- l don't know.

701
01:03:38,062 --> 01:03:39,730
You in touch with your CO?

702
01:03:39,814 --> 01:03:42,525
- That figures.
- What unit's he in?

703
01:03:42,608 --> 01:03:44,110
Baker Company, 506.

704
01:03:44,193 --> 01:03:47,405
- The guy with the broken foot?
- Charlie, l think.

705
01:03:47,488 --> 01:03:48,698
You think? Yeah.

706
01:03:48,781 --> 01:03:51,534
Ryan? Don't know... Man!

707
01:03:51,617 --> 01:03:53,786
Where was your drop zone?

708
01:03:53,869 --> 01:03:55,246
Just inside of Vierville.

709
01:03:55,329 --> 01:03:58,249
Vierville?
How did you end up here?

710
01:03:58,332 --> 01:03:59,458
You got me, sir.

711
01:03:59,542 --> 01:04:01,419
C-47 took heavy fire.

712
01:04:01,502 --> 01:04:04,505
Pilot tried to get out,
turning every which way.

713
01:04:04,589 --> 01:04:08,593
Took more fire in the drop.
Got messy. l ended up here.

714
01:04:08,676 --> 01:04:12,054
l haven't seen a single guy
from my stick, sir.

715
01:04:12,138 --> 01:04:15,725
Anybody there have a big mouth,
say where the drop was?

716
01:04:15,808 --> 01:04:19,395
No, sir, but they had
the same rally point as us.

717
01:04:19,478 --> 01:04:21,355
Show me.

718
01:04:21,439 --> 01:04:22,982
My men are beat.

719
01:04:23,065 --> 01:04:27,111
We'll hold up for three hours
then pull out after dark.

720
01:04:27,194 --> 01:04:31,115
Got anything left in this town
like a three-star hotel?

721
01:04:31,198 --> 01:04:34,035
Something with clean sheets
and room service?

722
01:04:34,118 --> 01:04:36,037
How about a nice comfy church?

723
01:04:36,120 --> 01:04:38,456
- We'll take that.
- Any news?

724
01:04:38,539 --> 01:04:40,041
How's it all falling together?

725
01:04:40,124 --> 01:04:42,001
Well, we got
the beachhead secure.

726
01:04:42,084 --> 01:04:44,837
Problem is Monty's taking
his time moving on Caen.

727
01:04:44,921 --> 01:04:47,465
We can't pull out
till he's ready, so...

728
01:04:47,548 --> 01:04:48,549
That guy's overrated.

729
01:04:48,633 --> 01:04:49,926
No argument here.

730
01:04:50,009 --> 01:04:52,762
You got to take Caen
so you can take Saint-Lo.

731
01:04:52,845 --> 01:04:54,847
Take Saint-Lo to take Valognes.

732
01:04:54,931 --> 01:04:56,474
Valognes, you got Cherbourg.

733
01:04:56,557 --> 01:04:58,017
And Cherbourg, you got Paris.

734
01:04:58,100 --> 01:05:00,436
Paris, you get Berlin.

735
01:05:00,519 --> 01:05:02,521
Then that big boat home.

736
01:05:04,649 --> 01:05:07,610
We sure could
use you around here,

737
01:05:07,693 --> 01:05:09,487
but l understand
what you're doing.

738
01:05:09,570 --> 01:05:10,738
You do?

739
01:05:10,821 --> 01:05:14,075
Yeah. l got a couple
of brothers myself.

740
01:05:14,158 --> 01:05:16,494
- Oh.
- Good luck.

741
01:05:16,577 --> 01:05:17,703
Thank you.

742
01:05:17,787 --> 01:05:19,455
No, l mean it.

743
01:05:19,538 --> 01:05:22,083
Find him. Get him home.

744
01:05:30,258 --> 01:05:32,552
What's with your hand?

745
01:05:32,635 --> 01:05:34,929
l don't know.

746
01:05:36,556 --> 01:05:40,351
lt started when they brought
us down for embarkation.

747
01:05:40,434 --> 01:05:41,894
lt comes and goes.

748
01:05:41,978 --> 01:05:45,189
You may have to get
yourself a new job.

749
01:05:45,273 --> 01:05:48,484
This one doesn't seem
to agree with you any more.

750
01:05:53,698 --> 01:05:54,865
What?

751
01:05:58,703 --> 01:06:00,913
- What?
- Nothing.

752
01:06:00,997 --> 01:06:03,916
What was the name
of that kid at Anzio?

753
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:07,003
He was always walking around
on his hands,

754
01:06:07,086 --> 01:06:11,007
and singing that song about
the man on the flying trapeze?

755
01:06:19,473 --> 01:06:20,850
Yeah, Vecchio.

756
01:06:20,933 --> 01:06:23,311
He was a goofy kid.

757
01:06:23,394 --> 01:06:27,607
Remember he used to pee
a ''V'' on everybody's jacket,

758
01:06:27,690 --> 01:06:29,775
for Vecchio.

759
01:06:29,859 --> 01:06:31,152
For victory.

760
01:06:31,235 --> 01:06:32,570
Vecchio.

761
01:06:35,406 --> 01:06:36,782
He was so short.

762
01:06:36,866 --> 01:06:40,745
- Wasn't he a midget?
- How did he become a Ranger?

763
01:06:43,372 --> 01:06:45,625
Got shot in the foot once.

764
01:06:45,708 --> 01:06:48,127
He could walk faster
on his hands.

765
01:06:50,129 --> 01:06:52,757
He could run faster
on his hands than...

766
01:07:08,522 --> 01:07:15,071
You see, when...you end up
killing one of your men,

767
01:07:15,154 --> 01:07:18,241
you tell yourself it happened

768
01:07:18,324 --> 01:07:25,456
so you could save the lives
of two or three or 10 others.

769
01:07:25,539 --> 01:07:27,500
Maybe a hundred others.

770
01:07:30,670 --> 01:07:34,757
Do you know how many men
l've lost under my command?

771
01:07:34,840 --> 01:07:38,135
- How many?
- 94.

772
01:07:38,219 --> 01:07:41,889
But that means
l've saved the lives

773
01:07:41,973 --> 01:07:44,225
of 10 times that many,
doesn't it?

774
01:07:44,308 --> 01:07:47,311
Maybe even 20, right?

775
01:07:47,395 --> 01:07:48,771
20 times as many?

776
01:07:54,527 --> 01:07:56,779
And that's how simple it is.

777
01:07:57,822 --> 01:08:00,032
That's how you...

778
01:08:00,116 --> 01:08:03,286
That's how you rationalise
making the choice

779
01:08:03,369 --> 01:08:06,539
between the mission and the men.

780
01:08:06,622 --> 01:08:09,584
Except this time,
this mission is a man.

781
01:08:13,004 --> 01:08:15,464
This Ryan better be worth it.

782
01:08:18,509 --> 01:08:21,429
He'd better go home
and cure some disease

783
01:08:21,512 --> 01:08:25,433
or invent a longer-lasting
light bulb or something.

784
01:08:25,516 --> 01:08:30,396
l wouldn't trade 10 Ryans
for one Vecchio or one Caparzo.

785
01:08:30,479 --> 01:08:32,315
Amen.

786
01:08:33,441 --> 01:08:36,569
Look. There it goes again.

787
01:08:36,652 --> 01:08:37,987
Sir...

788
01:08:38,070 --> 01:08:40,990
are you all right?

789
01:08:45,494 --> 01:08:48,414
Look, we're gonna
move out in two hours.

790
01:08:48,497 --> 01:08:50,291
Why don't you get some sleep?

791
01:08:50,374 --> 01:08:53,085
l don't know how he does it.

792
01:08:53,169 --> 01:08:54,462
What's that?

793
01:08:54,545 --> 01:08:57,173
Falls asleep like that.
Look at him.

794
01:08:57,256 --> 01:09:00,092
He's lights-out
the minute his head's down.

795
01:09:00,176 --> 01:09:01,510
Clear conscience.

796
01:09:01,594 --> 01:09:06,224
What's that saying? ''lf God's
on our side, who's on theirs?''

797
01:09:06,307 --> 01:09:09,560
''lf God be for us,
who could be against us?''

798
01:09:09,644 --> 01:09:11,062
Yeah, what did l say?

799
01:09:11,145 --> 01:09:12,563
Well, actually,

800
01:09:12,647 --> 01:09:16,025
the trick to falling asleep
is trying to stay awake.

801
01:09:16,108 --> 01:09:17,985
How is that, Wade?

802
01:09:18,069 --> 01:09:22,740
My mother was an intern,
she worked late nights,

803
01:09:22,823 --> 01:09:24,700
slept through the day,

804
01:09:24,784 --> 01:09:28,996
so the only time we got to talk
was when she'd get home.

805
01:09:29,080 --> 01:09:33,668
So l used to lie in my bed
and try to stay awake,

806
01:09:33,751 --> 01:09:37,171
but it never worked
'cause the harder l tried,

807
01:09:37,255 --> 01:09:39,298
the faster l'd fall asleep.

808
01:09:40,007 --> 01:09:42,552
That wouldn't have
mattered in my house.

809
01:09:42,635 --> 01:09:45,972
My ma would've shook me awake,
chatted till dawn.

810
01:09:46,055 --> 01:09:49,058
That woman
was never too tired to talk.

811
01:09:49,141 --> 01:09:52,603
Probably the only time
she could get a word in.

812
01:09:56,315 --> 01:10:01,279
Funny thing is,
sometimes she'd come home early,

813
01:10:01,362 --> 01:10:03,781
and l'd pretend to be asleep.

814
01:10:03,864 --> 01:10:06,617
Who? You...your mom?

815
01:10:06,701 --> 01:10:07,868
Yeah.

816
01:10:09,996 --> 01:10:12,873
She'd stand in the doorway
looking at me.

817
01:10:13,958 --> 01:10:16,502
And l'd just keep my eyes shut.

818
01:10:18,796 --> 01:10:22,842
l knew she just wanted
to find out about my day,

819
01:10:22,925 --> 01:10:24,719
that she came home early...

820
01:10:27,054 --> 01:10:29,807
just to talk to me.

821
01:10:31,517 --> 01:10:33,269
And l still wouldn't move.

822
01:10:33,352 --> 01:10:35,897
l'd still pretend
to just be asleep.

823
01:10:43,571 --> 01:10:47,158
l don't know why l did that.

824
01:10:59,337 --> 01:11:03,132
We only got a couple hours.
Go to sleep.

825
01:11:11,599 --> 01:11:15,061
Captain? Sir?

826
01:11:16,604 --> 01:11:18,064
Corporal?

827
01:11:22,777 --> 01:11:26,447
How you doin' there?
You all right?

828
01:11:26,530 --> 01:11:30,868
Yeah, l think this is
all good for me, sir.

829
01:11:30,952 --> 01:11:33,329
Really?

830
01:11:33,412 --> 01:11:35,456
How is that?

831
01:11:38,584 --> 01:11:41,254
''War educates the senses,

832
01:11:41,337 --> 01:11:43,339
''calls into action the will,

833
01:11:43,422 --> 01:11:46,509
''perfects the physical
constitution,

834
01:11:46,592 --> 01:11:49,554
''brings men into such
swift and close collision

835
01:11:49,637 --> 01:11:52,932
''in critical moments
that man measures man.''

836
01:11:53,015 --> 01:11:55,726
Yeah, well, l guess
that's Emerson's way

837
01:11:55,810 --> 01:11:57,812
of finding the bright side.

838
01:11:57,895 --> 01:12:02,191
- You know Emerson, sir?
- l know some.

839
01:12:05,945 --> 01:12:10,491
So where are you from, Captain?
What'd you do before the war?

840
01:12:12,076 --> 01:12:14,120
What's the pool up to?

841
01:12:17,832 --> 01:12:21,544
You know, l think
it's around 300, sir.

842
01:12:21,627 --> 01:12:24,088
Well, when it gets up to 500,

843
01:12:24,171 --> 01:12:28,467
l'll tell you and we'll split
the money, how about that?

844
01:12:28,551 --> 01:12:32,513
Well, sir, l feel it's my duty
under your command

845
01:12:32,597 --> 01:12:36,642
to suggest we wait until
it gets to a thousand, sir.

846
01:12:38,519 --> 01:12:41,188
What if we don't
live that long?

847
01:12:43,566 --> 01:12:47,111
- 500?
- 500 would be good, yeah.

848
01:12:47,194 --> 01:12:48,154
Yes, sir.

849
01:12:48,237 --> 01:12:49,614
Yeah.

850
01:12:51,741 --> 01:12:53,492
Get some sleep, Corporal.

851
01:12:53,576 --> 01:12:54,619
Yes, sir.

852
01:14:00,851 --> 01:14:02,645
Who's got sulphur powder?

853
01:14:05,690 --> 01:14:08,067
Medic! My buddy's bleeding!

854
01:14:08,150 --> 01:14:09,485
He needs a tourniquet!

855
01:14:09,569 --> 01:14:11,571
- Wade.
- Yes, sir?

856
01:14:11,654 --> 01:14:14,073
- Do what you can.
- Yes, sir.

857
01:14:14,156 --> 01:14:15,575
Hold on, fellas.

858
01:14:15,658 --> 01:14:17,159
lt won't be much longer.

859
01:14:17,243 --> 01:14:19,745
How we doing here?

860
01:14:19,829 --> 01:14:21,205
All right.

861
01:14:21,289 --> 01:14:23,666
Yeah, doing all right.
Don't worry about it.

862
01:14:23,749 --> 01:14:25,751
Doc's in town.

863
01:14:25,835 --> 01:14:27,169
lt's all right.
lt's all right.

864
01:14:27,253 --> 01:14:31,173
The 29th lnfantry's breaking
through, they'll be here soon.

865
01:14:31,257 --> 01:14:33,593
Plasma. Anybody got plasma?

866
01:14:33,676 --> 01:14:37,638
- Captain. Hey, Captain.
- Soldier, want to fill me in?

867
01:14:37,722 --> 01:14:39,473
Uh, yeah.
Lieutenant DeWindt, sir.

868
01:14:39,557 --> 01:14:42,810
99th Troop Carrier Squadron
carrying 327th Glider lnfantry.

869
01:14:42,894 --> 01:14:46,647
This one was mine.
l was the pilot. 22 dead.

870
01:14:46,731 --> 01:14:50,860
l ended up without a scratch.
Took my co-pilot's head off.

871
01:14:50,943 --> 01:14:52,778
Well, who are these people?

872
01:14:52,862 --> 01:14:57,158
The guys we came with,
they headed off first night.

873
01:14:57,241 --> 01:15:01,287
Other guys keep showing up.
One, two, half-dozen at a time.

874
01:15:01,370 --> 01:15:04,332
Then some officer'll
patch together a mixed unit,

875
01:15:04,415 --> 01:15:06,709
head off to make trouble, sir.

876
01:15:06,792 --> 01:15:08,711
We're looking for
Private James Ryan.

877
01:15:08,794 --> 01:15:11,005
Baker Company, 506 of the 101st.

878
01:15:11,088 --> 01:15:12,506
No, you got me, sir.

879
01:15:12,590 --> 01:15:13,841
A lot of guys
come in and out of here.

880
01:15:15,009 --> 01:15:16,010
Check that squad.

881
01:15:16,093 --> 01:15:19,931
- See if Ryan's in it.
- Yes, sir.

882
01:15:21,182 --> 01:15:25,478
Smell that leg right there.
ls it south of cheese?

883
01:15:31,859 --> 01:15:32,985
What?

884
01:15:38,532 --> 01:15:40,993
Keep moving. Keep moving!

885
01:15:43,162 --> 01:15:44,997
l'm Juden, you know?

886
01:15:45,081 --> 01:15:47,500
Ju-den.

887
01:15:47,583 --> 01:15:50,586
Yeah, l couldn't
pry him out of there,

888
01:15:50,670 --> 01:15:52,880
- l'd need a winch.
- Yeah.

889
01:15:56,425 --> 01:15:57,426
Stars.

890
01:15:57,510 --> 01:16:00,638
Yep, Brigadier General Amend,

891
01:16:00,721 --> 01:16:03,516
Deputy Commander, 101st.

892
01:16:03,599 --> 01:16:06,018
Some fucking genius
had the idea

893
01:16:06,102 --> 01:16:08,020
of welding steel plates on

894
01:16:08,104 --> 01:16:11,023
to keep the general safe
from ground fire.

895
01:16:11,107 --> 01:16:13,317
Unfortunately,
they forgot to tell me

896
01:16:13,401 --> 01:16:15,236
until we were getting airborne.

897
01:16:15,319 --> 01:16:17,321
That's like flying
a freight train.

898
01:16:17,405 --> 01:16:18,531
OK?

899
01:16:18,614 --> 01:16:19,949
Gross overload.

900
01:16:20,032 --> 01:16:22,743
Trim characteristics
all shot to hell.

901
01:16:22,827 --> 01:16:25,830
l nearly broke both my arms
keeping her level.

902
01:16:25,913 --> 01:16:27,832
And when...and when we released,

903
01:16:27,915 --> 01:16:31,919
l cut as hard as l could,
tried to gain altitude

904
01:16:32,003 --> 01:16:33,963
and still keep from stalling.

905
01:16:34,046 --> 01:16:36,007
Came down like a fucking meteor.

906
01:16:36,090 --> 01:16:38,926
Here's how we ended up.

907
01:16:39,010 --> 01:16:41,053
And the others,

908
01:16:41,137 --> 01:16:43,681
they stopped easy enough
OK, though, you know?

909
01:16:43,764 --> 01:16:47,727
We were just...we were
just too damn heavy, you know?

910
01:16:47,810 --> 01:16:50,104
The grass was wet.

911
01:16:50,187 --> 01:16:52,523
Downward slope and all.

912
01:16:52,607 --> 01:16:55,443
22 guys dead.

913
01:16:57,653 --> 01:16:59,488
All that for a general?

914
01:16:59,572 --> 01:17:01,699
One man.

915
01:17:03,492 --> 01:17:06,704
- Lot of that going around.
- Fubar.

916
01:17:06,787 --> 01:17:08,122
Fubar.

917
01:17:08,205 --> 01:17:09,582
Fubar.

918
01:17:09,665 --> 01:17:11,000
Fubar.

919
01:17:11,083 --> 01:17:13,169
Y'all got that right.

920
01:17:14,378 --> 01:17:17,465
l looked in a German dictionary.
There's no ''fubar'' in there.

921
01:17:17,548 --> 01:17:18,633
- Upham.
- Yes, sir?

922
01:17:18,716 --> 01:17:21,385
There's more paratroops.
Find out if one's Ryan.

923
01:17:21,469 --> 01:17:22,511
Yes, sir.

924
01:17:22,595 --> 01:17:25,598
You might want
to check these out, sir.

925
01:17:25,681 --> 01:17:27,475
Dog tags.

926
01:17:27,558 --> 01:17:31,145
More than l really
want to count, sir.

927
01:17:31,229 --> 01:17:34,273
l've...l've covered
a lot of bodies, sir.

928
01:17:34,357 --> 01:17:36,484
Jackson...

929
01:17:36,567 --> 01:17:38,069
start going through those.

930
01:17:38,152 --> 01:17:39,153
Yes, sir.

931
01:17:40,696 --> 01:17:42,573
l'll help.

932
01:17:44,116 --> 01:17:46,535
What do you think? He in there?

933
01:17:46,619 --> 01:17:48,829
lf he is, l'll find him.

934
01:17:48,913 --> 01:17:50,706
l bet he is.

935
01:17:50,790 --> 01:17:53,834
10 bucks says l nail him first.

936
01:17:53,918 --> 01:17:57,547
- Who we got...?
- You don't stand a chance.

937
01:17:57,630 --> 01:18:01,133
- You think he's in here?
- Just keep looking.

938
01:18:01,217 --> 01:18:03,427
All right. Gary lanico.

939
01:18:03,511 --> 01:18:04,762
Ben Rubino. Mike Cessacchio.

940
01:18:04,845 --> 01:18:07,098
All the Guineas
are buying it, huh?

941
01:18:07,181 --> 01:18:09,517
Oh, come on,
not the right name.

942
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:11,769
Wee Willie Winkie,
that's your buddy.

943
01:18:11,852 --> 01:18:14,063
We gotta find this prick.

944
01:18:18,317 --> 01:18:20,570
Where is this sonofabitch?

945
01:18:20,653 --> 01:18:23,781
Don't mix them up?
Keep them in your pile.

946
01:18:23,864 --> 01:18:25,783
How will l know who's here?

947
01:18:25,866 --> 01:18:28,661
Why don't you just shut up,
Reiben, all right?

948
01:18:28,744 --> 01:18:30,079
Everybody be friends.

949
01:18:30,162 --> 01:18:31,747
Cranky there, huh?

950
01:18:33,165 --> 01:18:34,542
l got a winner.

951
01:18:34,625 --> 01:18:36,002
What you talking about?

952
01:18:36,085 --> 01:18:37,461
Ryan.

953
01:18:37,545 --> 01:18:38,588
Ryan?

954
01:18:38,671 --> 01:18:40,506
Look at that, Mellish.

955
01:18:40,590 --> 01:18:44,260
You're a genius, you really are.
R-l-E-N-N-E.

956
01:18:44,343 --> 01:18:47,722
That's Rienne. That's French.
You know what that means?

957
01:18:47,805 --> 01:18:49,098
lt means nothing.

958
01:18:49,181 --> 01:18:53,477
- Three of a kind.
- All from New York.

959
01:18:53,561 --> 01:18:55,062
Do you need
a hand with that?

960
01:18:55,146 --> 01:18:56,564
l got a full house.

961
01:18:56,647 --> 01:18:58,566
Got you beat. Straight flush.

962
01:18:58,649 --> 01:19:02,069
You were looking at my tags.
You're cheating, you know?

963
01:19:02,153 --> 01:19:03,237
Ryan.

964
01:19:03,321 --> 01:19:04,947
Fuckin' unreal, this guy.

965
01:19:05,031 --> 01:19:06,449
Do you need a hand with that?

966
01:19:06,532 --> 01:19:07,825
Can you read that shit?

967
01:19:07,909 --> 01:19:10,244
Jesus, look at
this poor bastard.

968
01:19:10,328 --> 01:19:11,996
They're not bulletproof, huh?

969
01:19:12,079 --> 01:19:13,497
Guess not. All right?

970
01:19:13,581 --> 01:19:14,999
What's between his ears?

971
01:19:15,082 --> 01:19:18,502
Sort of what you
fellas got between your legs.

972
01:19:18,586 --> 01:19:21,047
We got to give him that.

973
01:19:21,130 --> 01:19:22,965
Not bad, Jackson.

974
01:19:23,049 --> 01:19:27,511
What the hell are you doing?
The whole Airborne's watching.

975
01:19:27,595 --> 01:19:28,721
These aren't chips.

976
01:19:28,804 --> 01:19:32,391
- All right, all right.
- Put 'em back in!

977
01:19:56,332 --> 01:19:58,000
He's not here.

978
01:20:00,753 --> 01:20:02,088
Put 'em back.

979
01:20:02,171 --> 01:20:05,007
Maybe we should split
into groups, huh?

980
01:20:05,091 --> 01:20:07,718
Wander the woods,
calling his name.

981
01:20:07,802 --> 01:20:10,388
He'll hear us
sooner or later. Ryan!

982
01:20:10,471 --> 01:20:14,183
That might be a little hard
to do, Captain.

983
01:20:14,267 --> 01:20:17,478
Maybe the locals... Hey, you
know... uh, excusez-moi.

984
01:20:17,562 --> 01:20:19,522
Parlez-vous Ryan, James Ryan?

985
01:20:19,605 --> 01:20:21,190
Merci. Merci beaucoup.

986
01:20:21,274 --> 01:20:23,234
Ryan! Anybody know Ryan,
101st Airborne?

987
01:20:23,317 --> 01:20:25,444
Ryan? You know a guy named Ryan?

988
01:20:25,528 --> 01:20:27,363
Private James Ryan from lowa?

989
01:20:27,446 --> 01:20:30,199
Anybody know a Ryan?

990
01:20:30,283 --> 01:20:31,325
James Ryan?!

991
01:20:31,409 --> 01:20:35,162
Hey, Joe, doesn't,
uh, Michaelson

992
01:20:35,246 --> 01:20:38,291
pal around with a Ryan
from ''C'' Company?

993
01:20:38,374 --> 01:20:39,458
l think so.

994
01:20:39,542 --> 01:20:41,669
Bring him up here, would you?

995
01:20:50,678 --> 01:20:52,013
You know Private Ryan?

996
01:20:52,096 --> 01:20:53,556
You're gonna have
to speak up, sir.

997
01:20:53,639 --> 01:20:56,225
Speak up, sir!
My hearing's not good!

998
01:20:56,309 --> 01:20:57,560
lt comes and goes!

999
01:20:57,643 --> 01:20:59,770
A grenade went off by me!

1000
01:20:59,854 --> 01:21:03,482
Got it, got it.
Do you know Private Ryan?

1001
01:21:03,566 --> 01:21:04,609
Who?

1002
01:21:04,692 --> 01:21:08,362
- Private Ryan? James Ryan?
- Jimmy Ryan?

1003
01:21:08,446 --> 01:21:11,449
James. James Francis Ryan.

1004
01:21:11,532 --> 01:21:14,327
No, no, no. James Francis Ryan.

1005
01:21:14,410 --> 01:21:17,413
Get me a pencil,
something to write on.

1006
01:21:17,496 --> 01:21:19,373
Quick! Come on, a pencil!

1007
01:21:21,709 --> 01:21:23,502
A small one, sir.

1008
01:21:24,212 --> 01:21:25,630
Write this down.

1009
01:21:25,713 --> 01:21:27,465
James Francis Ryan,
question mark.

1010
01:21:27,548 --> 01:21:29,842
lowa, question mark.

1011
01:21:29,926 --> 01:21:32,053
Do you know know him?

1012
01:21:32,136 --> 01:21:33,346
Read the message. Look.

1013
01:21:36,015 --> 01:21:38,142
Yeah. Of course
l know him, sir.

1014
01:21:38,226 --> 01:21:39,769
Where is he?

1015
01:21:43,314 --> 01:21:44,315
Yeah, yeah.

1016
01:21:44,398 --> 01:21:47,443
We missed our drop zone
by 20 miles,

1017
01:21:47,526 --> 01:21:50,446
ended up by Bumville
or some damn place.

1018
01:21:50,529 --> 01:21:53,699
We were coming here
to the rally point,

1019
01:21:53,783 --> 01:21:57,036
ran into a colonel
who was gathering up men

1020
01:21:57,119 --> 01:22:00,414
- to go to, uh...Ramelle...
- Ramelle.

1021
01:22:00,498 --> 01:22:03,292
Babysitting a bridge.
That's all l know, sir.

1022
01:22:03,376 --> 01:22:05,044
Great! Great!
Thank...thank you.

1023
01:22:05,127 --> 01:22:07,213
Write ''thank you.''
Read, and thank you.

1024
01:22:07,296 --> 01:22:08,548
You're welcome!

1025
01:22:08,631 --> 01:22:09,799
Assemble on me.

1026
01:22:12,009 --> 01:22:13,594
Thank you, Lieutenant.

1027
01:22:16,681 --> 01:22:18,933
Ramelle.

1028
01:22:19,016 --> 01:22:22,311
We're here. There.

1029
01:22:22,395 --> 01:22:23,479
Ramelle...

1030
01:22:23,563 --> 01:22:27,525
is on the Merderet river,
just south-west of us.

1031
01:22:27,608 --> 01:22:31,320
You know anything about
this bridge, Captain?

1032
01:22:31,404 --> 01:22:34,782
Yep. The target has
always been Cherbourg.

1033
01:22:34,865 --> 01:22:38,578
We can't push on Paris
without a deep water port,

1034
01:22:38,661 --> 01:22:40,246
Rommel knows that,

1035
01:22:40,329 --> 01:22:44,792
so he's gonna try to get
his armour across the river.

1036
01:22:44,875 --> 01:22:49,839
Then he can hit us in the flank
when we turn to Cherbourg.

1037
01:22:49,922 --> 01:22:55,052
That makes any village with a
bridge solid-gold real estate.

1038
01:23:15,364 --> 01:23:17,366
Let's go.

1039
01:23:26,167 --> 01:23:27,960
Captain.

1040
01:24:06,207 --> 01:24:07,875
What the hell is that?

1041
01:24:09,627 --> 01:24:12,838
A radar site.
Must be out of action.

1042
01:24:12,922 --> 01:24:15,049
Looks like there's
something in that...

1043
01:24:15,132 --> 01:24:17,593
sandbag bunker
right under the station.

1044
01:24:18,636 --> 01:24:19,637
See it?

1045
01:24:19,720 --> 01:24:21,597
Yeah. That's my guess, too.

1046
01:24:23,266 --> 01:24:25,643
What is it?

1047
01:24:25,726 --> 01:24:28,020
Machine gun. Probably MG-42.

1048
01:24:28,104 --> 01:24:30,398
Jesus. ls that
what got those guys?

1049
01:24:30,481 --> 01:24:32,984
Maybe one of them's our boy.

1050
01:24:33,067 --> 01:24:35,486
No, their patches are 82nd.

1051
01:24:35,570 --> 01:24:38,447
l don't know
how fast you guys are,

1052
01:24:38,531 --> 01:24:42,326
but let's detour this way,
they'll never know we were here.

1053
01:24:43,452 --> 01:24:47,456
So, Captain,
let's just go around it.

1054
01:24:47,540 --> 01:24:51,252
l hear what you're saying,
but we can't.

1055
01:24:51,335 --> 01:24:54,463
l'm with Reiben
on this one, sir.

1056
01:24:54,547 --> 01:24:58,259
- We left them 88s.
- For the Air Force.

1057
01:24:58,342 --> 01:25:02,346
The Air Force won't spend
ordinance on one machine gun.

1058
01:25:02,430 --> 01:25:04,557
Uh, Captain...

1059
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:07,643
We skip it and still
accomplish our mission.

1060
01:25:07,727 --> 01:25:10,313
l mean, this isn't
our mission, right?

1061
01:25:10,396 --> 01:25:13,941
That's what you want to do,
just leave it here?

1062
01:25:14,025 --> 01:25:16,068
Let them ambush
the next company?

1063
01:25:16,152 --> 01:25:20,615
No, sir, l'm simply saying, it
seems like an unnecessary risk

1064
01:25:20,698 --> 01:25:21,949
given our objective, sir.

1065
01:25:22,033 --> 01:25:24,327
Our objective is to win the war.

1066
01:25:27,288 --> 01:25:31,792
Sir, l just, uh, l don't have
a good feeling about this one.

1067
01:25:33,377 --> 01:25:36,964
When was the last time
you felt good about anything?

1068
01:25:58,611 --> 01:26:01,656
All right, three runners
with suppressing fire.

1069
01:26:01,739 --> 01:26:03,699
Mellish, you hook to the right.

1070
01:26:03,783 --> 01:26:05,576
l'll go up the middle.

1071
01:26:05,660 --> 01:26:07,453
Who's going left?
