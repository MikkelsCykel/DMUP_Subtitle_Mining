<i>From the dawn of time we came,</i>

2
00:00:34,968 --> 00:00:37,801
<i>moving silently among you...</i>

3
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:40,533
<i>down through the centuries...</i>

4
00:00:40,607 --> 00:00:43,269
<i>immortals.</i>

5
00:00:43,343 --> 00:00:48,542
I'm Connor MacLeod
of the clan MacLeod, the Highlander.

6
00:00:48,615 --> 00:00:51,140
After the death
of my friend Ramirez...

7
00:00:55,855 --> 00:00:59,382
<i>And my beloved wife Heather,</i>

8
00:00:59,459 --> 00:01:02,485
<i>I left my home in the highlands
of Scotland...</i>

9
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:07,363
<i>and began to wander the world
searching for answers.</i>

10
00:01:07,434 --> 00:01:10,232
Finally, I came toJapan...

11
00:01:10,303 --> 00:01:15,297
to the mountains of Niri
and the cave of the sorcerer Nakano.

12
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:27,632
<i>Great danger lies ahead, Highlander.</i>

13
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:31,040
<i>From a faraway land
comes another,</i>

14
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:34,341
<i>the most feared
and evil among us.</i>

15
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:39,541
He keeps growing
stronger everyday,

16
00:03:39,619 --> 00:03:43,646
<i>feeding on the power
of other immortals.</i>

17
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:48,456
<i>Soon, there will be none left
who can stop him.</i>

18
00:03:48,528 --> 00:03:51,053
<i>If he wins,</i>

19
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:54,827
<i>the world will suffer
eternal damnation.</i>

20
00:03:56,202 --> 00:03:58,670
Who is he?

21
00:04:01,474 --> 00:04:04,136
His name is Kane.

22
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:45,747
The mountain of Niri,
where is it?

23
00:04:46,986 --> 00:04:48,351
What for?

24
00:04:51,257 --> 00:04:55,921
Listen! Where is
the mountain of Niri?

25
00:04:55,995 --> 00:04:59,123
Do you seek the power
of the sorcerer Nakano?

26
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:05,896
<i>Maybe the old man
still can't hear me.</i>

27
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:08,600
- Burn it down!
- Yeah!

28
00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:28,057
- Hyah!
- No! Oh!

29
00:06:26,652 --> 00:06:29,587
<i>How do I kill him?</i>

30
00:06:29,655 --> 00:06:33,022
With heart, soul and steel.

31
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,392
I've heard that before.

32
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:39,464
I know. Ramirez.

33
00:06:39,532 --> 00:06:41,625
<i>Like him,</i>

34
00:06:41,701 --> 00:06:44,670
I have lived many lifetimes.

35
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:46,796
<i>And like him,</i>

36
00:06:46,873 --> 00:06:50,331
my gift to you is my knowledge.

37
00:07:12,231 --> 00:07:15,894
<i>The knowledge does not come easy,
Highlander.</i>

38
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:06,813
Nothing is what it seems,
Highlander.

39
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:12,551
First, you must be aware
and respect the power of illusion.

40
00:08:22,702 --> 00:08:25,762
You have already lost.

41
00:08:31,911 --> 00:08:34,004
Fight with your spirit...

42
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,514
and the sword will follow.

43
00:09:38,878 --> 00:09:41,472
Well done, Highlander.

44
00:09:41,547 --> 00:09:44,675
The sword wields the spirit
of its master.

45
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:48,982
It can be the gate
to either heaven or hell.

46
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:53,719
<i>Just strike at my head
and you will take all my knowledge.</i>

47
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:55,556
I will not.

48
00:09:58,998 --> 00:10:02,900
Not even for the power
of illusion?

49
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:12,875
Not even.

50
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:40,565
- Where to now, Kane?
- There.

51
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:21,305
Oh, yes.

52
00:11:22,548 --> 00:11:24,846
This is the place.

53
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:32,649
- Shh. You have to go now.
- What?

54
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:36,525
Shh. Trust me.
You must leave.

55
00:11:46,405 --> 00:11:48,339
Nakano.

56
00:11:49,608 --> 00:11:52,577
You have a long journey
ahead of you.

57
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:55,546
Why do I have to go?

58
00:11:55,614 --> 00:11:58,640
This is not your time,
Highlander.

59
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:00,618
Remember...

60
00:12:00,686 --> 00:12:03,382
they're both mine.

61
00:12:08,794 --> 00:12:10,819
Now, go!

62
00:12:13,132 --> 00:12:15,362
I won't forget you.

63
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:36,655
Ah, Nakano.

64
00:12:36,722 --> 00:12:39,054
So good to see you again.

65
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:42,561
The pleasure is always mine!

66
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:49,867
Actually, the pleasure's all mine!

67
00:12:51,904 --> 00:12:54,566
Where is the Highlander?

68
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,267
Huh?

69
00:13:00,246 --> 00:13:03,738
You age badly, you old goat.

70
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:05,613
Aah.

71
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:19,053
I think this is the Highlander.

72
00:13:25,104 --> 00:13:27,072
There can be only one!

73
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:30,768
Always in the way, old man, huh?

74
00:13:30,843 --> 00:13:34,506
More than you know.
When I tell you to go, just go!

75
00:13:36,515 --> 00:13:40,451
Go after the Highlander! Now!

76
00:13:44,523 --> 00:13:46,252
So.

77
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:53,026
Your magic has improved, wizard.
Why don't you give it to me?

78
00:13:53,098 --> 00:13:55,464
I didn't give it you 200 years ago.

79
00:13:55,534 --> 00:13:59,231
- I'm not about to now!
- Yes.

80
00:13:59,305 --> 00:14:03,469
<i>But if I cut off your head,
I get your magic anyway.</i>

81
00:14:03,542 --> 00:14:07,342
So... we could do this
the easy way...

82
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:11,110
or we could do this...
the hard way.

83
00:14:12,885 --> 00:14:15,479
My head doesn't come off that easy.

84
00:14:15,554 --> 00:14:19,820
No? But it does come off, nonetheless.

85
00:14:38,244 --> 00:14:40,235
You betrayed yourself, old man.

86
00:14:45,417 --> 00:14:47,851
There can be...

87
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,888
only one.

88
00:15:19,818 --> 00:15:22,719
Yes, only one!

89
00:15:22,788 --> 00:15:26,918
<i>But it will not be you!</i>

90
00:16:58,717 --> 00:17:00,810
Hi, Alex. Good to see you.

91
00:17:00,886 --> 00:17:03,684
Hi, Takamura. How are you?

92
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:04,950
Fine, thank you.

93
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,958
The archaeological commission
is waiting.

94
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,516
The owner of the corporation
is threatening...

95
00:17:08,594 --> 00:17:11,495
to shut us down so he can
continue his foundations.

96
00:17:11,563 --> 00:17:13,497
They can't stop the excavation now.

97
00:17:13,565 --> 00:17:18,025
TheJapanese government has respect
for a famous archaeologist as yourself,

98
00:17:18,103 --> 00:17:20,094
but this is a delicate situation.

99
00:17:23,142 --> 00:17:26,600
<i>Well, from what you sent me to
authenticate, defýnitely 16th century.</i>

100
00:17:26,678 --> 00:17:29,272
But check the grid points.

101
00:17:29,348 --> 00:17:33,944
Do you realize this spot is less
than a mile from the center of Niri?

102
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:38,388
What are you suggesting?
The cave of the sorcerer Nakano?

103
00:17:38,457 --> 00:17:40,891
Alex-san, Nakano is a legend.

104
00:17:40,959 --> 00:17:43,120
Oh, which reminds me.

105
00:17:44,663 --> 00:17:49,191
<i>- So's Babe Ruth... based on fact.
- Domo Arigato.</i>

106
00:17:49,268 --> 00:17:51,236
Oh, Alex.

107
00:17:51,303 --> 00:17:53,863
The commission.

108
00:19:35,073 --> 00:19:38,668
Highlander's out there somewhere.

109
00:19:38,744 --> 00:19:42,043
And he owes me for all those years.

110
00:19:43,715 --> 00:19:45,842
Find him!

111
00:19:47,419 --> 00:19:50,820
Nothing more!
Just fýnd him.

112
00:19:56,228 --> 00:19:58,162
Where are we?

113
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:00,425
<i>What's happening?</i>

114
00:20:00,499 --> 00:20:03,627
Nothing really left for you
to worry about, my friend.

115
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:06,933
<i>- There can be only one!
- Kane!</i>

116
00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:13,239
Ahhh.

117
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:48,333
Dad, is it okay?

118
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:50,705
Yeah.

119
00:21:52,177 --> 00:21:55,374
I didn't think there could be lightning
without clouds.

120
00:21:56,682 --> 00:21:58,547
Let's go.

121
00:22:06,124 --> 00:22:08,217
<i>How can this be happening?</i>

122
00:22:08,293 --> 00:22:12,320
<i>They were all dead
and the prize was mine.</i>

123
00:22:12,397 --> 00:22:15,594
<i>So who is out there?</i>

124
00:22:16,601 --> 00:22:18,933
<i>And where is he?</i>

125
00:22:33,485 --> 00:22:37,512
<i>If anything happens to me,
I want you to look afterJohn.</i>

126
00:22:37,589 --> 00:22:40,456
What are you talking about?

127
00:22:42,461 --> 00:22:44,952
I have to leave, Jack.

128
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:47,521
Everything is taken care of.

129
00:22:53,171 --> 00:22:55,867
Does the boy know
you're not his real father?

130
00:22:55,941 --> 00:22:59,809
Oh, yeah. He knew he was adopted
before he could spell it.

131
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:03,370
<i>I hope whatever's taking you
is worth what you're leaving.</i>

132
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:08,348
I hope so too.

133
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:11,685
But I don't have a choice.

134
00:23:20,098 --> 00:23:24,899
<i>I know he's alive...
and I have to fýnd him.</i>

135
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:30,837
<i>Going back to New York
to the place of the gathering...</i>

136
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:33,036
<i>is not what I had in mind.</i>

137
00:23:33,111 --> 00:23:37,878
<i>Once again, my life was about to change.</i>

138
00:23:55,901 --> 00:23:58,961
What are they doing?
I thought we got clearance last night.

139
00:23:59,037 --> 00:24:02,268
You won't believe this, Alex-san.
Someone broke into the dig.

140
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:06,470
Oh, shit.

141
00:24:13,885 --> 00:24:15,819
So what did they take?

142
00:24:15,887 --> 00:24:18,082
- We don't know.
- What do you mean, you don't know?

143
00:24:18,156 --> 00:24:21,421
I couldn't pass the police line.
They found two bodies.

144
00:24:48,019 --> 00:24:51,113
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

145
00:24:51,189 --> 00:24:54,886
So this must be the inner chamber.

146
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,555
<i>But how did they know it was here?</i>

147
00:25:07,205 --> 00:25:10,299
<i>Look at this!
What, 1500s?</i>

148
00:25:10,375 --> 00:25:13,208
Remarkable copy.

149
00:25:16,248 --> 00:25:20,446
- Alex.
- I just want a sample.

150
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:24,182
- Why?
- I don't think it's a copy.

151
00:25:32,597 --> 00:25:34,929
<i>John.</i>

152
00:25:40,639 --> 00:25:42,607
John.

153
00:25:51,483 --> 00:25:56,079
Hey. I'm not gonna be away long.

154
00:25:56,154 --> 00:25:58,054
Well, you better call me.

155
00:25:58,123 --> 00:26:02,253
Hey. You better call me.

156
00:26:02,327 --> 00:26:06,195
You take care of the place.
You're in charge now.

157
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,659
Come here.

158
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:13,533
I love you, John.

159
00:26:23,448 --> 00:26:27,942
<i>Get out of the road!</i>

160
00:26:41,166 --> 00:26:45,193
<i>Hey, pendejo. What are ya doin' here?
Stop the car!</i>

161
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:50,037
<i>Hey, Antonio.</i>

162
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:53,703
<i>Hey, vamos, carnales.</i>

163
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:57,179
Yeah, that's a cold thing, my man.

164
00:26:57,248 --> 00:26:59,113
Pretty late for a walk,
hey, motherfucker?

165
00:26:59,184 --> 00:27:02,278
<i>- Little boy lost his way.
- Cat got his tongue. Meow.</i>

166
00:27:02,354 --> 00:27:07,257
Hey, fuckhead, I'm talkin' to you.

167
00:27:07,325 --> 00:27:10,055
Nice blade.

168
00:27:36,454 --> 00:27:39,617
Gang beating! Malloy! Here!

169
00:27:39,691 --> 00:27:42,285
<i>- Clear the way! Come on, move!
- Severe trauma.</i>

170
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:45,329
- Internal bleeding, two gunshot wounds.
- Vital signs?

171
00:27:45,397 --> 00:27:46,955
<i>- Stable.
- Lucky guy.</i>

172
00:27:47,032 --> 00:27:48,499
<i>- Notify the police?
- Of course.</i>

173
00:27:48,566 --> 00:27:51,296
What the fuck are you talking about?
These aren't bullet wounds.

174
00:27:51,369 --> 00:27:52,859
- Impossible.
- Stop wasting my time!

175
00:27:52,937 --> 00:27:55,405
<i>- This guy was shot!
- You can deal with it.</i>

176
00:27:55,473 --> 00:27:58,772
- Doctor! Malloy!
- Restrain him!

177
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:01,607
Grab hold of him!
Get me a sedative!

178
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:05,446
Let me go! You don't understand!

179
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:08,008
Let me go!

180
00:28:08,086 --> 00:28:12,455
Take him up to ward seven right away.

181
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:14,151
- Ward seven?
- You got a problem with that?

182
00:28:14,225 --> 00:28:17,991
This guy's a lunatic.

183
00:29:09,614 --> 00:29:12,549
Well...

184
00:29:12,617 --> 00:29:15,586
it's defýnitely not a fake.

185
00:29:19,958 --> 00:29:23,121
It doesn't make any sense.

186
00:29:26,331 --> 00:29:28,891
Alex-san, how do you explain this?

187
00:29:28,967 --> 00:29:32,596
- Where'd you fýnd it?
- In the chamber.

188
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:36,401
It's old, maybe 300, 400 years.
But look at the pattern.

189
00:29:36,474 --> 00:29:41,537
<i>- The weave. Certainly notJapanese.
- Looks like some sort of tartan.</i>

190
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:45,049
Scotland?
That's a long way from Japan.

191
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:47,880
Especially 400 years ago.

192
00:30:06,938 --> 00:30:12,638
<i>Waterloo, my greatest battle. If only
I'd used my left flank before dawn.</i>

193
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:15,406
Wellington, you swine!

194
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:20,816
<i>You are better prepared than me.
Me, the great emperor Napoleon.</i>

195
00:30:20,885 --> 00:30:23,479
Keep it down.

196
00:30:25,256 --> 00:30:27,190
Who are you?

197
00:30:29,394 --> 00:30:31,362
Martin. Remember?

198
00:30:31,429 --> 00:30:33,727
- Your favorite soldier.
- Martin?

199
00:30:33,798 --> 00:30:35,663
- Yes.
- Is it you?

200
00:30:35,733 --> 00:30:38,429
- Yeah.
- My God, what are you doing here?

201
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:41,597
I had to warn you.
You're in great danger.

202
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:44,642
I know. It's not safe here.

203
00:30:44,709 --> 00:30:48,008
Please help me.

204
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:51,173
Oh, great one.

205
00:30:51,249 --> 00:30:54,377
My mission is not over yet.

206
00:30:56,754 --> 00:30:58,915
What mission?

207
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:00,924
Wellington. Remember?

208
00:31:00,992 --> 00:31:04,359
I have to kill him.

209
00:31:04,429 --> 00:31:08,126
Nephew, make him suffer.

210
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:11,965
- Hey, how do I get out of here?
- Leave it to me.

211
00:31:16,007 --> 00:31:20,205
Soldiers, I'm proud of you!

212
00:31:20,278 --> 00:31:22,803
Finally the time has come
and the time is now!

213
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:26,783
Hip, hip, hooray!

214
00:32:06,057 --> 00:32:09,083
Shut up!

215
00:32:51,836 --> 00:32:55,237
- Yeah. Let's dump this stuff and go.
- Where you want to go eat?

216
00:33:34,379 --> 00:33:36,313
<i>Highlander!</i>

217
00:33:40,485 --> 00:33:42,419
<i>I am your shadow!</i>

218
00:33:43,921 --> 00:33:45,855
Where is Kane?

219
00:33:45,923 --> 00:33:48,824
<i>Don't worry about Kane.</i>

220
00:33:53,731 --> 00:33:55,756
Worry about me.

221
00:34:17,355 --> 00:34:21,018
You've already lost.

222
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:26,224
<i>There can be only one.</i>

223
00:35:31,262 --> 00:35:33,196
So what do you got, Vorisek?

224
00:35:33,264 --> 00:35:36,290
We got a body here
and we got a head over there.

225
00:35:36,367 --> 00:35:38,699
Now, I suspect foul play.

226
00:35:38,769 --> 00:35:41,636
Maybe you should've taken over
for Carson, you're so funny.

227
00:35:41,706 --> 00:35:46,268
Lieutenant, we got a guy in a Halloween
costume gets his head sliced off.

228
00:35:46,344 --> 00:35:50,075
- It's not your usual assassination.
- Where's the sword?

229
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:53,640
- How'd you know about that?
- I remember things.

230
00:35:53,718 --> 00:35:56,585
You, you forget, but I remember.

231
00:35:56,654 --> 00:36:00,556
Hey, Lieutenant, you know,
we checked for prints already.

232
00:36:00,625 --> 00:36:03,253
<i>Wasted your time.
You won't fýnd nothin'.</i>

233
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:06,819
Somebody broke out of the psycho ward,
came down and did this hell of a mess.

234
00:36:06,898 --> 00:36:09,025
Russell Nash.

235
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:12,558
- You see, he's a genius.
- Yeah? So you know the victim?

236
00:36:15,139 --> 00:36:17,505
I know the killer.

237
00:36:42,633 --> 00:36:44,601
<i>Mr. Nash.</i>

238
00:36:44,669 --> 00:36:47,502
LieutenantJohn Stenn, N.Y.P.D.

239
00:36:47,572 --> 00:36:50,837
<i>- What do you want?
- Eight years ago, you got away with it.</i>

240
00:36:50,908 --> 00:36:55,368
But I'm not Detective Bedsoe.
I'm gonna nail you. That's a promise.

241
00:36:56,347 --> 00:36:58,975
Have a good night, Lieutenant.

242
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:14,023
<i>Whoop. Sorry, Charlie.</i>

243
00:37:14,098 --> 00:37:16,965
- Twenty bucks in my hand.
- Twenty in mine.

244
00:37:17,034 --> 00:37:20,003
- All right.
- Yo, yo, the brother. The brother.

245
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:22,801
My brother, come on in, come on in.

246
00:37:22,873 --> 00:37:26,240
Tell you what, you fýnd the red card,
I'll give you $20 now.

247
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:28,574
Easy as that. You do my magic.

248
00:37:28,646 --> 00:37:31,114
<i>Boom. You're on.</i>

249
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:44,985
- I never seen that shit before.
- Hey, yo, how'd he do that?

250
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:49,194
Hey, yo! Yo, gimme back my money.

251
00:37:51,402 --> 00:37:53,529
<i>My glasses!</i>

252
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:56,801
Fuck it, man.
You keep the money, all right?

253
00:38:35,413 --> 00:38:38,143
Welcome back, MacLeod.

254
00:39:04,975 --> 00:39:08,809
Get back in the car immediately, please!
My son...

255
00:39:08,879 --> 00:39:12,440
I have with me American archaeologist,
Dr. Alex Johnson,

256
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:15,542
who's from the New York Museum
of Ancient History.

257
00:39:15,619 --> 00:39:18,645
<i>Dr. Johnson, what can you tell us
about the discovery,</i>

258
00:39:18,723 --> 00:39:20,657
and why is it so exciting?

259
00:39:20,725 --> 00:39:22,784
Well, the artifacts
are clearly exceptional,

260
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:24,919
but only after
a much more detailed analysis...

261
00:39:24,995 --> 00:39:28,954
- Sarah.
- Can we speculate the identities...

262
00:39:30,468 --> 00:39:32,698
Do I know you?

263
00:39:38,776 --> 00:39:40,710
No.

264
00:39:40,778 --> 00:39:43,906
No. Hmm?

265
00:39:43,981 --> 00:39:46,108
I thought not.

266
00:39:47,618 --> 00:39:51,645
So, what are you doing here?

267
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:54,088
Well, I may be mistaken,
but I had the feeling...

268
00:39:54,158 --> 00:39:56,854
that this was the house
of Mr. DeFernet.

269
00:39:56,927 --> 00:40:00,522
Well, you're obviously not mistaken.

270
00:40:00,598 --> 00:40:03,761
Ah, Connor MacLeod.

271
00:40:03,834 --> 00:40:06,997
I see you've met
my rather spirited niece, Sarah.

272
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:11,804
- She's come here from England.
- It seems I'm in need of taming.

273
00:40:11,876 --> 00:40:15,039
Pleasant challenge... I would imagine.

274
00:40:15,112 --> 00:40:19,913
<i>I invited him for the weekend
to join us at the card table.</i>

275
00:40:19,984 --> 00:40:23,476
- So you're a gambler, Mr. MacLeod?
- On occasion.

276
00:40:23,554 --> 00:40:26,990
So am I.

277
00:40:27,057 --> 00:40:29,184
On occasion.

278
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:31,387
<i>Any chance of a preview?</i>

279
00:40:31,462 --> 00:40:34,795
Not at this point, but some
of the more unusual objects...

280
00:40:34,865 --> 00:40:37,060
will be lent
to our existing exhibition...

281
00:40:37,134 --> 00:40:40,729
<i>However, is it not possible
to be stepping on the site...</i>

282
00:40:40,805 --> 00:40:45,538
of the legendary lost cave of
the greatJapanese sorcerer Nakano?

283
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:50,911
<i>As I've said before, any speculation at
this point would be a little premature.</i>

284
00:40:50,981 --> 00:40:55,418
<i>Well, is it not true that supported
by your own controversial studies,</i>

285
00:40:55,486 --> 00:40:59,115
<i>that legends can be used
to identify archaeological sites?</i>

286
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:03,024
<i>It is true that we have seen parallels
between missing sites before.</i>

287
00:41:03,093 --> 00:41:05,027
<i>What about the inscriptions?</i>

288
00:41:05,095 --> 00:41:08,064
<i>Do they offer clues
or is this some cave-robbing graffýti?</i>

289
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:10,430
It's probably just some ancient taggers.

290
00:41:10,501 --> 00:41:13,732
<i>Taggers. Well, Ms. Johnson,
so no idea what it means?</i>

291
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:17,968
I know what it means.

292
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:23,777
As for the alphabet...
uh, early Russian.

293
00:41:27,384 --> 00:41:30,319
"There can be only one. "

294
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:34,883
Only one what?

295
00:41:34,959 --> 00:41:38,224
Alex-san, another fax from Tommy.

296
00:41:38,295 --> 00:41:41,731
"A little something
to read on the flight home.

297
00:41:41,799 --> 00:41:45,496
<i>I thought this might interest you. "</i>

298
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:52,240
Well, that's it for me.
I'm off to New York tonight.

299
00:41:52,309 --> 00:41:55,403
<i>Better document that last crate.</i>

300
00:42:05,422 --> 00:42:09,290
The man wants vinyl
when he can have the real thing?

301
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:12,329
I don't think so.

302
00:42:12,396 --> 00:42:14,990
Come on.

303
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:32,448
Why don't you come here a little bit
and make yourself comfortable?

304
00:42:32,516 --> 00:42:35,041
You nice, big boy.

305
00:42:37,855 --> 00:42:40,790
<i>Come on, you little devil.</i>

306
00:42:41,859 --> 00:42:43,850
Silent type, huh?

307
00:42:43,928 --> 00:42:46,897
<i>It fýne by me, baby.</i>

308
00:42:46,964 --> 00:42:50,832
But I'm telling you...
no glove...

309
00:42:53,871 --> 00:42:56,931
no love.

310
00:43:01,712 --> 00:43:04,647
<i>What you waiting for, honey?</i>

311
00:43:07,952 --> 00:43:10,182
<i>Come on, baby.</i>

312
00:43:20,464 --> 00:43:24,491
<i>So after three days,
this better be good.</i>

313
00:43:24,568 --> 00:43:28,595
Well, it wasn't easy, but I fýnally
determined the cause of death.

314
00:43:28,672 --> 00:43:31,004
All right, now that we've had
our little joke, what else you got?

315
00:43:31,075 --> 00:43:33,043
Nothin'.

316
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:36,739
Besides havin' his head cut off,
he's in perfect health.

317
00:43:36,814 --> 00:43:41,274
No broken bones, no cavities,
no organ deterioration.

318
00:43:41,352 --> 00:43:43,684
Like a newborn baby.
Find out who he is?

319
00:43:43,754 --> 00:43:48,555
He's nobody.
No prints, no dental, no nothin'.

320
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:52,585
It's like he never existed.
So what do you really think, Howard?

321
00:43:52,663 --> 00:43:56,292
Mmm. I think you better not smoke
in here, Lieutenant.

322
00:43:56,367 --> 00:43:59,734
What's this guy doin' in New York City?

323
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:03,531
What's he doin' on the planet?

324
00:44:03,607 --> 00:44:05,973
Thanks, Howard!

325
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:23,259
<i>MacLeods. I checked it.
Same pattern, didn't match up.</i>

326
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:26,057
<i>Apparently,
this alteration in the color...</i>

327
00:44:26,130 --> 00:44:30,226
denotes a branch of the clan
that broke away in, I think, 1536.

328
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:32,234
Some incident occurred that year...

329
00:44:32,302 --> 00:44:34,634
involving a Connor MacLeod
who was driven from his home,

330
00:44:34,705 --> 00:44:38,698
accused of wielding powers
thought to have been unnatural.

331
00:44:38,776 --> 00:44:41,939
So in defýance, the father altered this
insignia to honor the son's lineage,

332
00:44:42,012 --> 00:44:44,776
but there's been no record
of this branch ever since.

333
00:44:44,848 --> 00:44:47,339
Except for a piece of cloth.

334
00:44:47,418 --> 00:44:51,252
Which could now place one of them
in a Japanese cave a few years later.

335
00:44:51,321 --> 00:44:54,347
Yeah, but what would
a Scot be doing there?

336
00:44:54,425 --> 00:44:57,087
What if he was one of these
Gaelic mystics?

337
00:44:57,161 --> 00:45:00,289
<i>Nakano's initiates were said
to have been great sorcerers, right?</i>

338
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:04,801
- Yeah.
- None of the legends refer to where they came from.

339
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:09,168
Interesting theory, but, Alex,
no records, no proof.

340
00:45:10,674 --> 00:45:15,509
Once a year, the MacLeods meet
at Dunvegan Castle, Isle of Skye.

341
00:45:15,579 --> 00:45:18,548
According to the registrar,
this entry was made in 1986,

342
00:45:18,615 --> 00:45:20,776
some antique dealer claiming
to be a direct descendant...

343
00:45:20,851 --> 00:45:22,785
of this particular branch.

344
00:45:22,853 --> 00:45:25,617
So where's this guy from?

345
00:45:25,689 --> 00:45:29,785
New York. They faxed me his address.

346
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:33,853
What? You're gonna harass
some poor guy about his ancestors?

347
00:45:33,931 --> 00:45:37,628
- He's gonna think you're crazy.
- Perhaps.

348
00:45:37,701 --> 00:45:40,829
Then again, at this point,

349
00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:44,567
it may be my only link to Nakano.

350
00:45:44,641 --> 00:45:47,337
Well... I'm off.

351
00:45:47,411 --> 00:45:49,845
Bye, Tommy.

352
00:45:49,913 --> 00:45:51,847
I'll tell security you're working late.

353
00:45:51,915 --> 00:45:53,849
Thanks.

354
00:46:27,718 --> 00:46:30,812
<i>- What do you call this place?
- Excuse me?</i>

355
00:46:31,922 --> 00:46:35,323
This place, here.
What do you call it?

356
00:46:35,392 --> 00:46:38,759
Uh... A museum, but we're closed.

357
00:46:38,829 --> 00:46:41,593
Museum. Ah, no, please.

358
00:46:41,665 --> 00:46:44,793
I'm your biggest fan.
You see, I saw you on television.

359
00:46:44,868 --> 00:46:47,428
I'm a big historian myself really.

360
00:46:47,504 --> 00:46:51,065
Ah, this looks familiar.

361
00:46:51,141 --> 00:46:55,840
Oh, isn't it amazing how the present
just can't seem to escape the past?

362
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:58,973
C- Can I help you with something?

363
00:46:59,049 --> 00:47:03,611
No, no, no. I'm just a...
Just doing a little research.

364
00:47:04,755 --> 00:47:08,486
Ooh, look at this cave.
Little small, eh?

365
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:11,426
And what does your museum call it?

366
00:47:12,729 --> 00:47:14,788
- A model.
- A model.

367
00:47:14,865 --> 00:47:17,231
And you?

368
00:47:17,301 --> 00:47:21,670
Um, um,
a vision of a past reality, I suppose.

369
00:47:21,738 --> 00:47:24,639
Oh, reality. No, not reality.

370
00:47:24,708 --> 00:47:27,472
Reality is so boring.
I much prefer...

371
00:47:28,412 --> 00:47:31,142
illusion or fantasy,

372
00:47:31,215 --> 00:47:34,810
a little hocus pocus
and maybe a little...

373
00:47:37,688 --> 00:47:40,088
Maybe a little bit of...

374
00:47:40,157 --> 00:47:42,648
hanky-panky, huh?

375
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:59,534
Connor MacLeod.

376
00:48:00,744 --> 00:48:04,305
Don't worry, my prissy, I'll fýnd him.

377
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:09,075
I'm gonna fýnd him.

378
00:48:26,803 --> 00:48:28,737
<i>Burn it down.</i>

379
00:49:52,556 --> 00:49:56,390
I'm outside theJapanese
Spiritual Center in Queens.

380
00:50:05,102 --> 00:50:07,161
Hyah!

381
00:50:07,237 --> 00:50:09,171
Ya!

382
00:50:11,942 --> 00:50:15,070
- Good to have you back, Nash.
- Good to see you, Charlie.

383
00:50:46,576 --> 00:50:48,168
Hyah!

384
00:50:51,448 --> 00:50:53,382
Come on! Come on!

385
00:50:53,450 --> 00:50:56,010
Come on!

386
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:05,123
Whooo-oh!
Come on. Come on.

387
00:51:06,163 --> 00:51:08,097
Hyah!

388
00:51:41,298 --> 00:51:45,029
I wish we could go on like this
for a thousand years.

389
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:52,932
What do you wish?

390
00:51:53,009 --> 00:51:55,034
MacLeod?

391
00:51:58,515 --> 00:52:01,382
That he had better timing.

392
00:52:01,451 --> 00:52:05,615
What do you want, Pierre?

393
00:52:05,689 --> 00:52:09,352
<i>I have bad news.</i>

394
00:52:09,426 --> 00:52:11,553
They need you in Paris.

395
00:52:11,628 --> 00:52:14,119
Why now?

396
00:52:14,197 --> 00:52:17,030
<i>The revolution has started.
You must leave the girl.</i>

397
00:52:20,537 --> 00:52:22,596
<i>Come now, my friend.</i>

398
00:52:22,672 --> 00:52:25,368
If not for you, then do it for her.

399
00:52:35,118 --> 00:52:38,110
You're not coming back, are you?

400
00:52:40,157 --> 00:52:42,785
You have to get back to England.

401
00:52:42,859 --> 00:52:46,852
- It won't be safe here.
- No one is safe now.

402
00:52:47,931 --> 00:52:49,956
Connor.

403
00:52:51,902 --> 00:52:53,961
Take this.

404
00:53:17,327 --> 00:53:18,919
Russell Nash?

405
00:53:18,995 --> 00:53:22,522
- Excuse me?
- Sorry. Are you Russell Nash?

406
00:53:22,599 --> 00:53:26,695
- What if I am?
- I'm looking for the previous owner of your shop,

407
00:53:26,770 --> 00:53:28,704
a Connor MacLeod.

408
00:53:28,772 --> 00:53:32,572
You wouldn't happen to know
where I could fýnd him, would you?

409
00:53:34,911 --> 00:53:36,879
Did you follow me?

410
00:53:36,947 --> 00:53:39,040
Yes.

411
00:53:39,115 --> 00:53:42,243
I haven't seen him in eight years.

412
00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:44,719
Do... Do you know
if he's still in the area?

413
00:53:44,788 --> 00:53:47,313
I wish I could help you, Miss Johnson.

414
00:53:48,758 --> 00:53:50,817
How do you know my name?

415
00:53:52,295 --> 00:53:56,231
Well, your, uh, discovery in Japan
has made you famous.

416
00:53:57,534 --> 00:53:59,729
You're obviously...

417
00:53:59,803 --> 00:54:02,795
interested in Japan yourself, Mr. Nash.

418
00:54:02,872 --> 00:54:06,239
Strange food. Good cars.

419
00:54:06,309 --> 00:54:08,675
Tough deals.

420
00:54:08,745 --> 00:54:12,044
Listen, it's getting late.
Good night, Miss Johnson.

421
00:54:12,115 --> 00:54:15,016
<i>Look, Mr. Nash,
I don't mean to bother you,</i>

422
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:18,077
but you're my only link
to this Connor MacLeod.

423
00:54:18,154 --> 00:54:23,057
Try the phone book.
There's plenty of MacLeods in New York.

424
00:54:23,126 --> 00:54:26,357
Well, thanks,
but I'm only looking for one.

425
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:30,760
So am I.

426
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:39,435
Four hundred years...

427
00:54:39,509 --> 00:54:42,569
is a long time to hate.

428
00:54:42,646 --> 00:54:45,240
Ohh. And you never wrote.

429
00:54:48,151 --> 00:54:51,609
But hate feeds you.
It focuses the mind.

430
00:54:51,688 --> 00:54:54,054
Keeps you warm.

431
00:54:54,124 --> 00:54:56,888
Gives you hope. Eh, MacLeod?

432
00:55:01,865 --> 00:55:04,026
Don't worry about the girl.

433
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:06,898
<i>She's not really my type.</i>

434
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:11,066
A little too... pale.

435
00:55:11,141 --> 00:55:14,872
Then again, this being the 90s,
I could make an exception, huh?

436
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:19,276
After all, I've got so much
catching up to do.

437
00:55:20,350 --> 00:55:22,113
<i>This is a Buddhist shrine, Kane,</i>

438
00:55:22,185 --> 00:55:24,653
<i>and we can't fýght on holy ground.</i>

439
00:55:24,721 --> 00:55:29,090
Oh, well... I guess
I'll be the judge of that.

440
00:55:58,521 --> 00:56:00,489
Hyah!

441
00:56:04,561 --> 00:56:08,497
Oooh.

442
00:56:47,537 --> 00:56:49,664
Nothing!

443
00:57:09,592 --> 00:57:12,857
There can be only...

444
00:57:12,929 --> 00:57:15,363
<i>One!</i>

445
00:57:27,944 --> 00:57:32,404
After 400 years, patience is a virtue.

446
00:57:41,658 --> 00:57:44,684
Jesus Christ. I'm goin' in!

447
00:57:49,999 --> 00:57:52,695
Listen!

448
00:57:52,769 --> 00:57:56,432
Whatever you saw, you saw nothing.

449
00:57:58,541 --> 00:58:01,374
You don't know
what you're getting yourself into.

450
00:58:01,444 --> 00:58:03,605
Stay away.

451
00:58:16,626 --> 00:58:18,856
Freeze! Police!

452
00:58:23,132 --> 00:58:26,761
<i>One more thing
I think you should know about...</i>

453
00:58:26,836 --> 00:58:29,532
There was a woman.

454
00:58:29,606 --> 00:58:33,872
Worked with us once in a while.
Brenda.

455
00:58:33,943 --> 00:58:37,435
<i>Brenda Wyatt.</i>

456
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:40,642
<i>- What about her?
- Well, she was fascinated by it.</i>

457
00:58:40,717 --> 00:58:43,811
The murders, the swords...
the whole thing.

458
00:58:43,887 --> 00:58:48,221
Lieutenant, it's what,
5:00 in the morning?

459
00:58:48,291 --> 00:58:51,727
They scraped her off a highway
in Scotland seven years ago.

460
00:58:51,794 --> 00:58:56,424
<i>She was killed instantly,</i>

461
00:58:56,499 --> 00:59:00,629
but he walked away without a scratch.

462
00:59:04,307 --> 00:59:06,138
Sad for him.

463
00:59:08,845 --> 00:59:13,782
<i>So, are you sure
you didn't see anything?</i>

464
00:59:19,222 --> 00:59:22,885
<i>- Miss Johnson!
- Sorry. No.</i>

465
00:59:22,959 --> 00:59:26,986
<i>Russell Nash is a dangerous man.</i>

466
00:59:27,063 --> 00:59:31,056
<i>Now I suggest you stay away from him.</i>

467
00:59:33,369 --> 00:59:35,860
<i>That's exactly what he said.</i>

468
01:00:04,067 --> 01:00:07,036
<i>Please, my friend. For the revolution.</i>

469
01:00:10,807 --> 01:00:13,708
<i>MacLeod!
Visitor!</i>

470
01:00:19,315 --> 01:00:25,743
<i>Calm down, MacLeod. If you die,
we lose a great warrior against evil.</i>

471
01:00:25,822 --> 01:00:27,756
I'm here to take your place.

472
01:00:29,926 --> 01:00:32,224
Go home and sleep it off.

473
01:00:32,295 --> 01:00:34,229
Come on.

474
01:00:38,067 --> 01:00:43,903
I'm tired of this eternal life.
Death would release me from my pain.

475
01:00:43,973 --> 01:00:46,134
Come on, Pierre. Go home.

476
01:00:46,209 --> 01:00:48,143
<i>I'm not going anywhere.</i>

477
01:00:56,252 --> 01:00:58,117
It's time, Mr. MacLeod.

478
01:01:04,761 --> 01:01:06,695
When he wakes up, throw him out.

479
01:01:14,170 --> 01:01:16,104
God be with you.

480
01:01:27,850 --> 01:01:31,616
<i>For treason against the King of France.</i>

481
01:01:31,688 --> 01:01:33,656
Connor MacLeod.

482
01:01:43,132 --> 01:01:46,329
Connor! Connor!

483
01:01:46,402 --> 01:01:48,495
Connor!

484
01:01:53,376 --> 01:01:55,344
Oh, Sarah.

485
01:02:09,792 --> 01:02:11,851
Yes?

486
01:02:11,928 --> 01:02:14,021
Well, it was a very interesting
evening last night,

487
01:02:14,097 --> 01:02:17,658
but I didn't exactly have time to
check the phone book... Mr. MacLeod.

488
01:02:20,803 --> 01:02:22,737
You wanna come in?

489
01:02:24,373 --> 01:02:26,307
Come in.

490
01:02:36,285 --> 01:02:39,413
I'll fýx you a drink.
Make yourself comfortable.

491
01:02:41,824 --> 01:02:43,758
Thanks.

492
01:02:56,773 --> 01:02:59,071
<i>You've, uh, got quite a collection.</i>

493
01:03:31,107 --> 01:03:33,200
<i>- Hello?
- Mr. MacLeod?</i>

494
01:03:33,276 --> 01:03:35,210
<i>This is Janet at Super Travel.</i>

495
01:03:35,278 --> 01:03:40,545
I'm calling to confýrm your reservation
on the Newark-Glasgow flight.

496
01:03:40,616 --> 01:03:44,052
Your ticket is prepaid
and waiting at the counter.

497
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:46,247
- Thanks.
- Bye.

498
01:03:46,322 --> 01:03:48,483
Bye.

499
01:03:56,132 --> 01:03:57,997
Lot of Connors in the family.

500
01:04:04,106 --> 01:04:06,040
<i>Her name was Sarah.</i>

501
01:04:39,675 --> 01:04:41,609
Come on, dear.

502
01:04:45,181 --> 01:04:47,672
Ah, Papa.

503
01:05:14,810 --> 01:05:17,870
Look, I don't know
what was going on last night,

504
01:05:17,947 --> 01:05:21,348
but I think it's got something
to do with what I'm working on.

505
01:05:21,417 --> 01:05:23,544
We found a piece of tartan
in the cave that was traced to...

506
01:05:23,619 --> 01:05:26,452
an undocumented branch
of the MacLeods, of which...

507
01:05:26,522 --> 01:05:29,616
<i>you are apparently
the only member on record.</i>

508
01:05:29,692 --> 01:05:32,286
That cave was sealed 400 years ago.

509
01:05:35,364 --> 01:05:40,233
Have you ever heard of the legend
of the sorcerer Nakano?

510
01:05:40,303 --> 01:05:43,704
Don't you ever think about
anything else but business?

511
01:05:46,876 --> 01:05:48,901
Do you have something
better to offer?

512
01:05:50,212 --> 01:05:53,010
<i>It seems I'm in need of taming.</i>

513
01:05:53,082 --> 01:05:55,482
Pleasant challenge...
I would imagine.

514
01:05:57,553 --> 01:06:00,420
<i>Well, I'm sure you'll let me know
if something comes to mind, huh?</i>

515
01:06:04,627 --> 01:06:07,858
<i>Hm. What's this?</i>

516
01:06:07,930 --> 01:06:10,421
<i>Looks familiar.</i>

517
01:06:13,602 --> 01:06:15,536
<i>Death to the MacLeods!</i>

518
01:06:53,809 --> 01:06:58,542
<i>My bonny Heather,
my fýrst wife, my fýrst love.</i>

519
01:07:00,549 --> 01:07:03,712
<i>I came back here
because this is where it all started.</i>

520
01:07:05,287 --> 01:07:08,017
<i>And I need some strength.</i>

521
01:07:52,868 --> 01:07:54,802
God.

522
01:09:04,306 --> 01:09:07,707
Ahh. The last 400 years...

523
01:09:07,776 --> 01:09:11,268
have been good to you, MacLeod.

524
01:09:19,555 --> 01:09:21,785
Oh.

525
01:09:21,857 --> 01:09:24,724
Oops-a-daisy.

526
01:09:27,763 --> 01:09:30,732
Hi. Leave a message;
I'll call you back.

527
01:09:30,799 --> 01:09:34,860
<i>Uh, hi, it's me, John.</i>

528
01:09:34,937 --> 01:09:37,963
<i>I miss you.
When are you coming home?</i>

529
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:40,474
<i>Uh, y-you said you were
gonna call me, remember?</i>

530
01:09:40,543 --> 01:09:45,071
<i>Well, in case you forgot,
it's Marrakesh 1442.</i>

531
01:09:45,147 --> 01:09:47,240
<i>Love you, Daddy. Bye.</i>

532
01:09:57,393 --> 01:09:59,327
Daddy.

533
01:10:04,900 --> 01:10:06,834
Daddy.

534
01:10:23,919 --> 01:10:25,853
Hey, MacLeod.

535
01:10:26,922 --> 01:10:29,982
I thought you'd fýnd me.

536
01:10:33,896 --> 01:10:35,989
Why did you come?

537
01:10:45,241 --> 01:10:47,607
Nakano.

538
01:10:54,650 --> 01:11:00,088
<i>O bonny Portmore</i>

539
01:11:00,155 --> 01:11:04,353
<i>I am sorry to see</i>

540
01:11:04,426 --> 01:11:10,626
<i>Such a woeful destruction</i>

541
01:11:10,699 --> 01:11:15,500
<i>Of your ornament tree</i>

542
01:11:15,571 --> 01:11:19,530
<i>For it stood on your shore</i>

543
01:11:19,608 --> 01:11:25,877
<i>For many's the long day</i>

544
01:11:25,948 --> 01:11:30,885
<i>Till the long boats from Antrim</i>

545
01:11:30,953 --> 01:11:34,889
<i>Came to float it away</i>

546
01:11:38,794 --> 01:11:43,731
<i>O bonny Portmore</i>

547
01:11:43,799 --> 01:11:48,532
<i>You shine where you stand</i>

548
01:11:48,604 --> 01:11:54,736
<i>And the more I think on you</i>

549
01:11:54,810 --> 01:11:59,406
<i>The more I think long</i>

550
01:11:59,481 --> 01:12:03,417
<i>If I had you now</i>

551
01:12:03,485 --> 01:12:08,889
<i>As I had once before</i>

552
01:12:08,957 --> 01:12:14,418
<i>All the Lords in Old England</i>

553
01:12:14,496 --> 01:12:19,934
<i>Would not purchase Portmore</i>

554
01:12:23,672 --> 01:12:28,803
<i>All the birds in the forest</i>

555
01:12:28,877 --> 01:12:32,711
<i>They bitterly weep</i>

556
01:12:32,781 --> 01:12:38,879
<i>Saying, Where shall we shelter</i>

557
01:12:38,954 --> 01:12:43,050
<i>Where shall we sleep</i>

558
01:12:43,125 --> 01:12:47,789
<i>For the Oak and the Ash</i>

559
01:12:47,863 --> 01:12:53,324
<i>They are all cutten down</i>

560
01:12:53,402 --> 01:12:58,931
<i>And the walls of bonny Portmore</i>

561
01:12:59,007 --> 01:13:05,412
<i>Are all down to the ground</i>

562
01:13:10,886 --> 01:13:12,911
You seem like you belong here.

563
01:13:15,524 --> 01:13:19,551
Maybe I used to.
But that was a long time ago.

564
01:13:28,604 --> 01:13:30,504
You spend a lot of time alone.

565
01:13:30,572 --> 01:13:33,132
I'm used to it.

566
01:13:33,208 --> 01:13:35,301
Nobody is.

567
01:13:38,847 --> 01:13:40,781
You don't let people in, do you?

568
01:13:42,217 --> 01:13:44,447
I can't.

569
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:47,614
- It hurts. Love and...
- And see them die?

570
01:13:47,689 --> 01:13:50,624
Like the woman in the painting.

571
01:13:51,693 --> 01:13:55,789
Yes. I loved her very much.

572
01:14:00,869 --> 01:14:03,667
I know who you are.

573
01:14:03,739 --> 01:14:06,173
You're Connor MacLeod.

574
01:14:07,776 --> 01:14:10,506
Born into the clan MacLeod,
in Glen Finnan,

575
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:13,914
on the shores of Loch Shiel.

576
01:14:16,318 --> 01:14:20,516
You were driven
from your home in 1536.

577
01:14:23,358 --> 01:14:26,953
- And I cannot die.
- And have wandered the world ever since.

578
01:16:43,332 --> 01:16:45,129
- Mr. MacLeod?
- Yeah?

579
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:47,259
There's a Jack Donovan
on the phone returning your call.

580
01:16:47,336 --> 01:16:49,270
I'll be right back.

581
01:16:54,576 --> 01:16:57,044
- Jack.
- What are you doing in Scotland?

582
01:16:57,112 --> 01:17:01,572
- What do you mean?
- John's on the flight from Marrakesh.

583
01:17:01,650 --> 01:17:05,313
<i>He gets into Newark
tomorrow afternoon as planned.</i>

584
01:17:05,387 --> 01:17:08,982
- What are you saying, Jack?
- Is something wrong with your memory?

585
01:17:09,057 --> 01:17:12,584
I've just dropped him at the airport.
Is there a problem?

586
01:17:12,661 --> 01:17:16,028
No problem, Jack. I'll pick him up.

587
01:17:16,098 --> 01:17:18,293
Bye, Jack. Thanks.

588
01:17:28,176 --> 01:17:32,670
Passport, please.
You're traveling alone?

589
01:17:32,748 --> 01:17:35,478
Um, yeah,
but my dad's picking me up.

590
01:17:37,052 --> 01:17:39,543
Welcome to the United States,
Mr. MacLeod.

591
01:17:39,621 --> 01:17:41,680
Thanks.

592
01:18:06,314 --> 01:18:08,874
- Yeah.
- What?

593
01:18:08,950 --> 01:18:10,440
- They got Nash.
- Where?

594
01:18:10,519 --> 01:18:12,714
All right, we'll be right there.

595
01:18:12,788 --> 01:18:16,315
Northwest Airlines. Flight 489.
Just landed in Newark.

596
01:18:16,391 --> 01:18:18,621
Come on, move. Let's go!

597
01:18:18,694 --> 01:18:21,822
<i>It's over there.
The green bag. Grab it.</i>

598
01:18:29,571 --> 01:18:32,938
I know he's here somewhere.
I can feel him.

599
01:18:45,921 --> 01:18:47,855
Excuse me.

600
01:18:49,391 --> 01:18:51,655
- Excuse me.
- Did you see that?

601
01:18:52,861 --> 01:18:55,421
Next.

602
01:19:17,519 --> 01:19:19,282
- Dad!
- John.

603
01:19:29,831 --> 01:19:31,924
- Freeze!
- Let me go!

604
01:19:33,101 --> 01:19:35,035
<i>John!</i>

605
01:19:37,439 --> 01:19:40,704
- Where's the Porsche?
- The Porsche. Get in the car.

606
01:19:42,878 --> 01:19:45,369
Little punk.

607
01:19:58,426 --> 01:20:00,553
Who... Who are you?

608
01:20:01,830 --> 01:20:03,821
I'm a friend of your daddy's.

609
01:20:08,170 --> 01:20:09,762
- He's got my son.
- What son, Nash?

610
01:20:09,838 --> 01:20:13,774
There's nothing in your fýle
about a son. You're a fuckin' liar!

611
01:20:13,842 --> 01:20:16,436
<i>Nash, what son?</i>

612
01:20:16,511 --> 01:20:19,537
<i>Please, stop the car! Please!
Let me outta here!</i>

613
01:20:19,614 --> 01:20:22,606
<i>- "Let me out of here. Stop the car. "
- Stop!</i>

614
01:20:22,684 --> 01:20:25,448
<i>Please! Look at the plane!
There's a plane!</i>

615
01:20:26,688 --> 01:20:29,122
<i>No!</i>

616
01:20:32,627 --> 01:20:34,925
Whoo! I ain't missin' my plane!

617
01:20:36,965 --> 01:20:40,264
<i>Whoa! Whoa!</i>

618
01:20:46,341 --> 01:20:48,639
<i>You take the wheel!</i>

619
01:20:48,710 --> 01:20:50,769
<i>Watch out! Give it back!</i>

620
01:20:52,180 --> 01:20:54,080
Ohh! Mother!

621
01:20:54,149 --> 01:20:56,674
Okay, guys, I'll take it from here.

622
01:20:56,751 --> 01:20:58,616
Okay. Good luck, Lieutenant.

623
01:21:01,323 --> 01:21:05,089
So, Nash, talk to me.
We've got plenty of time.

624
01:21:09,331 --> 01:21:12,061
<i>Whoo!</i>

625
01:21:12,133 --> 01:21:14,863
- Hey! Aaah!
- It's a truck! Stop!

626
01:21:20,508 --> 01:21:22,442
Help!

627
01:21:25,680 --> 01:21:27,773
This is fuckin' bullshit.

628
01:21:27,849 --> 01:21:30,511
Without a confession,
we got nothin' on this guy.

629
01:21:32,821 --> 01:21:36,086
So if we can't charge him,
he's gonna have to release him.

630
01:21:36,157 --> 01:21:38,125
Pretty stuffy, eh?

631
01:21:38,193 --> 01:21:40,320
Need a little ventilation, eh?

632
01:21:40,395 --> 01:21:43,922
<i>There goes!</i>

633
01:21:43,999 --> 01:21:48,299
Now, fýrst rule of safety:
Keep your eye on the road!

634
01:21:50,205 --> 01:21:54,369
What's that? It's a wall!

635
01:21:57,612 --> 01:22:01,309
Okay, Nash,
you're free to go... for now.

636
01:22:01,383 --> 01:22:04,011
- Oh, yeah. One more thing.
- What?

637
01:22:04,085 --> 01:22:07,111
One day you'll make a mistake,
and when you do, I'll nail ya.

638
01:22:07,188 --> 01:22:09,748
I've heard that before.

639
01:22:09,824 --> 01:22:11,758
Let the fucker go.

640
01:22:15,263 --> 01:22:18,528
Your daddy can't save you now.

641
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:22,331
<i>MacLeod... or Highlander...
whatever you're going by these days.</i>

642
01:22:22,404 --> 01:22:24,736
- It's your boy.
- Dad!

643
01:22:24,806 --> 01:22:28,333
I hope I wasn't too hard on him.

644
01:22:28,410 --> 01:22:33,848
<i>I'm at the old mission.
Route 1.Jersey City. Do come.</i>

645
01:23:51,993 --> 01:23:55,087
Dad!

646
01:23:55,163 --> 01:24:00,328
Ah, the importance of teaching young
people family values. Hah? Smoke.

647
01:24:00,402 --> 01:24:03,337
- Don't touch him.
- Ha-ha! Little punk.

648
01:24:03,405 --> 01:24:05,839
- Come here, John.
- Go see your father.

649
01:24:08,076 --> 01:24:12,240
<i>Ohh! Disappearance in the family.</i>

650
01:24:12,313 --> 01:24:16,579
It's funny. You know, I... I thought
immortals couldn't have children.

651
01:24:16,651 --> 01:24:18,983
But it seems that while
I'm the master of illusion,

652
01:24:19,054 --> 01:24:23,787
you are turning out to be
the master of deception, Highlander.

653
01:24:23,858 --> 01:24:27,919
How did you do it? How did you convince
all those lovely women of yours...

654
01:24:27,996 --> 01:24:31,693
<i>that they were the ones
that couldn't bear children?</i>

655
01:24:31,766 --> 01:24:34,860
When all the while it was you
and your little immortal pecker...

656
01:24:34,936 --> 01:24:37,564
that really didn't do the pecking.

657
01:24:37,639 --> 01:24:40,369
Ohh. I know.

658
01:24:40,442 --> 01:24:42,706
<i>You must've been very disappointed.</i>

659
01:24:42,777 --> 01:24:47,043
<i>All those nice years thinking
you were the only one left.</i>

660
01:24:47,115 --> 01:24:50,915
But, you see, the prize was never yours.

661
01:24:50,985 --> 01:24:56,048
And now, it never will be. Amen.

662
01:24:56,124 --> 01:25:01,027
Nice little speech, Kane,
but it's not gonna save your head.

663
01:25:01,096 --> 01:25:02,996
Where's John?

664
01:25:04,332 --> 01:25:06,698
Oh. Well, come with me.

665
01:25:06,768 --> 01:25:10,568
<i>Come. Where's Johnny?</i>

666
01:25:32,393 --> 01:25:34,327
<i>Here's Johnny.</i>

667
01:25:35,864 --> 01:25:38,128
<i>Ahh.</i>

668
01:26:00,989 --> 01:26:03,787
<i>Ooh.</i>

669
01:26:45,466 --> 01:26:47,991
<i>MacLeod.</i>

670
01:26:50,138 --> 01:26:52,936
<i>- What are you doing here?
- I followed you.</i>

671
01:26:53,007 --> 01:26:56,704
L... I just thought I could help.

672
01:27:10,158 --> 01:27:12,319
Aah!

673
01:27:15,763 --> 01:27:19,096
Aw, shit!

674
01:27:23,204 --> 01:27:25,331
Come on.

675
01:27:27,875 --> 01:27:31,936
<i>Come on. Come on.</i>

676
01:27:35,984 --> 01:27:38,111
<i>Ooh, MacLeod.</i>

677
01:27:38,186 --> 01:27:40,984
You're such a lady-killer.

678
01:27:54,702 --> 01:27:57,796
I can't kill an unarmed man.

679
01:27:57,872 --> 01:28:00,306
Take it.

680
01:28:00,375 --> 01:28:02,707
But then again, life isn't fair, is it?

681
01:30:17,678 --> 01:30:21,273
I'll see you... in hell.

682
01:30:23,217 --> 01:30:25,208
I'll be the judge of that.

683
01:30:45,206 --> 01:30:47,265
There can be only one.

684
01:32:22,236 --> 01:32:24,295
Dad?

685
01:32:28,876 --> 01:32:30,844
Dad?

686
01:32:35,049 --> 01:32:36,983
Oh, John.

687
01:32:52,199 --> 01:32:54,497
Oh, John.

688
01:33:08,382 --> 01:33:10,976
<i>Will ya do somethin'for me, Connor?</i>

689
01:33:11,052 --> 01:33:15,955
<i>In the years to come, will ya light
a candle and remember me on my birthday?</i>

690
01:33:18,459 --> 01:33:20,518
<i>Aye, love. I will.</i>

691
01:33:25,433 --> 01:33:27,993
<i>There's
a fresh breeze blowing off the loch.</i>

692
01:33:31,105 --> 01:33:33,801
<i>The glen is snowy and cold.</i>

693
01:33:33,874 --> 01:33:36,468
<i>It's the most glorious sight on Earth.</i>

694
01:33:39,380 --> 01:33:42,508
<i>I've found no place
to match it in 400 years.</i>

695
01:33:44,118 --> 01:33:49,420
<i>I'm back now... with a woman I love
and a son I've taken as my own.</i>

696
01:33:55,529 --> 01:33:57,963
<i>I'm at peace.</i>

697
01:33:58,032 --> 01:33:59,966
<i>It's fýnally over.</i>

698
01:34:08,009 --> 01:34:12,912
<i>O bonny Portmore</i>

699
01:34:12,980 --> 01:34:17,542
<i>I am sorry to see</i>

700
01:34:17,618 --> 01:34:23,614
<i>Such a woeful destruction</i>

701
01:34:23,691 --> 01:34:28,492
<i>Of your ornament tree</i>

702
01:34:28,562 --> 01:34:32,521
<i>For it stood on your shore</i>

703
01:34:32,600 --> 01:34:38,630
<i>For many's the long day</i>

704
01:34:38,706 --> 01:34:43,871
<i>Till the long boats from Antrim</i>

705
01:34:43,944 --> 01:34:47,880
<i>Came to float it away</i>

706
01:34:51,786 --> 01:34:56,723
<i>O bonny Portmore</i>

707
01:34:56,791 --> 01:35:02,127
<i>You shine where you stand</i>

708
01:35:02,196 --> 01:35:07,725
<i>And the more I think on you</i>

709
01:35:07,802 --> 01:35:12,398
<i>The more I think long</i>

710
01:35:12,473 --> 01:35:16,409
<i>If I had you now</i>

711
01:35:16,477 --> 01:35:21,881
<i>As I had once before</i>

712
01:35:21,949 --> 01:35:27,410
<i>All the Lords in Old England</i>

713
01:35:27,488 --> 01:35:32,926
<i>Would not purchase Portmore</i>

714
01:35:36,163 --> 01:35:41,362
<i>All the birds in the forest</i>

715
01:35:41,435 --> 01:35:45,701
<i>They bitterly weep</i>

716
01:35:45,773 --> 01:35:51,541
<i>Saying, Where shall we shelter</i>

717
01:35:51,612 --> 01:35:56,049
<i>Where shall we sleep</i>

718
01:35:56,117 --> 01:36:00,451
<i>For the Oak and the Ash</i>

719
01:36:00,521 --> 01:36:06,323
<i>They are all cutten down</i>

720
01:36:06,393 --> 01:36:11,922
<i>And the walls of bonny Portmore</i>

721
01:36:11,999 --> 01:36:18,404
<i>Are all down to the ground</i>

722
01:36:21,575 --> 01:36:27,013
<i>O bonny Portmore</i>

723
01:36:27,081 --> 01:36:32,417
