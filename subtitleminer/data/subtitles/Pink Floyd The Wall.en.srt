1
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,280
Christmas comes but once a year

2
00:01:05,364 --> 00:01:09,645
For every girl and boy

3
00:01:09,729 --> 00:01:14,010
The laughter and the joy

4
00:01:14,093 --> 00:01:18,541
They find in each new toy

5
00:01:18,626 --> 00:01:23,074
I'll tell you of a little boy

6
00:01:23,158 --> 00:01:27,606
Who lives across the way

7
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:32,055
This little fella 's Christmas

8
00:01:32,139 --> 00:01:36,461
Is just another day

9
00:03:07,484 --> 00:03:10,547
It was just before dawn

10
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:13,275
One miserable morning

11
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:15,332
In black '44

12
00:03:17,513 --> 00:03:23,053
When the forward commander
was told to sit tight

13
00:03:23,136 --> 00:03:27,081
When he asked that
his men be withdrawn

14
00:03:30,271 --> 00:03:33,082
And the generals gave thanks

15
00:03:33,166 --> 00:03:35,097
As the other ranks

16
00:03:35,182 --> 00:03:38,622
Held back the enemy tanks

17
00:03:38,705 --> 00:03:40,678
For a while

18
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:43,280
And the Anzio bridgehead

19
00:03:43,364 --> 00:03:45,881
Was held for the price

20
00:03:45,966 --> 00:03:49,156
Of a few hundred ordinary lives

21
00:04:15,468 --> 00:04:17,985
He's the little boy

22
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:25,035
That Santa Claus forgot

23
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,386
And Goodness knows

24
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:32,673
He didn 't want a lot

25
00:04:34,351 --> 00:04:38,128
He sent a note to Santa

26
00:04:38,213 --> 00:04:43,165
For some soldiers and a drum

27
00:04:43,249 --> 00:04:46,816
It broke his little heart

28
00:04:46,899 --> 00:04:51,515
When he found Santa hadn't come

29
00:04:52,314 --> 00:04:54,831
In the street he envies

30
00:04:54,915 --> 00:04:59,112
All those lucky boys

31
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:31,152
So ya thought ya

32
00:07:31,195 --> 00:07:33,167
Might like to

33
00:07:33,209 --> 00:07:35,181
Go to the show

34
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:42,525
To feel the warm thrill
of confusion

35
00:07:42,608 --> 00:07:45,798
That space cadet glow

36
00:07:47,477 --> 00:07:52,345
Tell me, is something
eluding you, sunshine

37
00:07:52,428 --> 00:07:56,794
Is this not what
you expected to see

38
00:07:56,877 --> 00:08:01,703
If you wanna find out
what's behind these cold eyes

39
00:08:01,744 --> 00:08:06,948
You'll just have to
claw your way through this disguise

40
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:37,815
Mama loves her baby

41
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,521
And Daddy loves you too

42
00:10:45,746 --> 00:10:49,984
And the sea may look
warm to you, babe

43
00:10:51,536 --> 00:10:54,643
And the sky may look blue

44
00:10:56,279 --> 00:11:00,349
Ooh, ooh, ooh

45
00:11:00,434 --> 00:11:02,532
Ooh, babe

46
00:11:07,064 --> 00:11:11,135
Ooh, ooh, ooh

47
00:11:11,219 --> 00:11:14,407
Baby blue

48
00:11:18,101 --> 00:11:23,472
Ooh, ooh, ooh

49
00:11:23,514 --> 00:11:27,669
Ooh, ooh, babe

50
00:11:30,355 --> 00:11:34,090
If you should go skating

51
00:11:34,174 --> 00:11:37,195
On the thin ice of modern life

52
00:11:40,133 --> 00:11:42,567
Dragging behind you

53
00:11:42,651 --> 00:11:45,084
The silent reproach

54
00:11:45,169 --> 00:11:49,407
Of a million tear-stained eyes

55
00:11:51,086 --> 00:11:53,100
Don 't be surprised

56
00:11:53,184 --> 00:11:56,374
When a crack in the ice

57
00:11:56,457 --> 00:12:00,024
Appears under your feet

58
00:12:01,452 --> 00:12:06,949
You slip out of your depth
and out of your mind

59
00:12:07,033 --> 00:12:10,894
With you fear
flowing out behind you

60
00:12:10,977 --> 00:12:13,538
As you claw the thin ice

61
00:13:12,834 --> 00:13:17,954
Daddy's flown across the ocean

62
00:13:22,696 --> 00:13:27,355
Leaving just a memory

63
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:36,923
A snapshot in the family album

64
00:13:42,336 --> 00:13:48,001
Daddy, what else
did you leave for me

65
00:13:54,589 --> 00:13:57,864
Daddy, what'd ya leave behind for me

66
00:14:02,522 --> 00:14:04,746
All in all it was

67
00:14:04,829 --> 00:14:07,893
Just a brick in the wall

68
00:14:12,425 --> 00:14:17,546
All in all it was all
just bricks in the wall

69
00:14:40,584 --> 00:14:42,473
Easy. Be careful.

70
00:14:53,719 --> 00:14:55,860
- What?
- Will you put me on there?

71
00:14:55,943 --> 00:14:58,923
- Well, where's your mother, then?
- She's gone to the shops.

72
00:14:59,007 --> 00:15:01,021
Yes, all right.

73
00:15:03,119 --> 00:15:05,721
How's that then? Enjoying it?

74
00:15:12,016 --> 00:15:13,148
Lovely, lovely.

75
00:15:23,892 --> 00:15:27,123
Now off you go.
Go on.

76
00:15:29,096 --> 00:15:31,194
Now what have I told you about this?
What have I told you?

77
00:15:31,278 --> 00:15:35,139
Go on, go on now. Sling your hook.
Go on. Sling your hook.

78
00:17:37,174 --> 00:17:39,609
And kind old King George

79
00:17:39,692 --> 00:17:42,545
Sent Mother a note

80
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:45,358
When he heard that Father was gone

81
00:17:48,253 --> 00:17:50,813
It was, I recall

82
00:17:50,897 --> 00:17:53,960
In the form of a scroll

83
00:17:54,044 --> 00:17:56,184
Gold leaf and all

84
00:17:59,205 --> 00:18:02,186
And I found it one day

85
00:18:02,269 --> 00:18:05,585
In a drawer of old photographs

86
00:18:05,669 --> 00:18:07,599
Hidden away

87
00:18:09,698 --> 00:18:13,684
And my eyes still grow damp
to remember

88
00:18:13,768 --> 00:18:16,622
His Majesty signed

89
00:18:16,706 --> 00:18:19,476
With his own rubber stamp

90
00:18:22,204 --> 00:18:24,847
It was dark all around

91
00:18:24,931 --> 00:18:27,448
There was frost in the ground

92
00:18:27,533 --> 00:18:30,680
When the tigers broke free

93
00:18:33,786 --> 00:18:36,261
And no one survived

94
00:18:36,345 --> 00:18:41,633
From the Royal Fusiliers Company C

95
00:18:44,781 --> 00:18:48,053
They were all left behind

96
00:18:48,137 --> 00:18:50,824
Most of them dead

97
00:18:50,907 --> 00:18:54,936
The rest of them dying

98
00:18:56,531 --> 00:19:00,056
And that's how the high command

99
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:03,917
Took my daddy from me

100
00:20:05,061 --> 00:20:09,551
Did you see the frightened ones

101
00:20:09,592 --> 00:20:13,873
Did you hear the falling bombs

102
00:20:13,956 --> 00:20:18,573
Did you ever wonder why
we had to run for shelter

103
00:20:18,657 --> 00:20:24,322
When the promise of a brave new world
unfurled beneath the clear blue sky

104
00:20:40,648 --> 00:20:44,843
Did you see the frightened ones

105
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:49,375
Did you hear the falling bombs

106
00:20:49,459 --> 00:20:54,579
The flames are all long gone
but the pain lingers on

107
00:20:58,230 --> 00:21:00,244
Good-bye

108
00:21:00,328 --> 00:21:02,805
Blue sky

109
00:21:02,889 --> 00:21:06,372
Good-bye, blue sky

110
00:21:06,456 --> 00:21:08,387
Good-bye

111
00:21:10,904 --> 00:21:12,834
Good-bye

112
00:21:19,422 --> 00:21:22,612
Wait for me, Pinky,
you rotten bleeder.

113
00:21:22,695 --> 00:21:25,634
- They're my bullets, ain't they?
- I don't know.

114
00:21:25,717 --> 00:21:29,117
Come on, Tubs.
It's great down in the tunnel.

115
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:31,551
Don't you think
it'd be dangerous, Pinky?

116
00:21:31,634 --> 00:21:33,440
No. Don't be daft.

117
00:21:45,189 --> 00:21:47,750
- You all right, Tubs?
- Yeah. Hurt me knee a bit.

118
00:21:55,849 --> 00:21:57,527
- Come on.
- Na. It's too dangerous.

119
00:21:57,612 --> 00:22:00,549
- We'll wait for the train.
- Give me the torch.

120
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:13,264
Pinky! Here comes the train !

121
00:22:13,348 --> 00:22:15,867
Get off the line,
you bloody idiot! Here it comes!

122
00:22:18,594 --> 00:22:21,784
Pinky, get off the line!
Here it comes!

123
00:22:23,043 --> 00:22:24,007
Pinky, get off the line!

124
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,563
You !

125
00:22:46,543 --> 00:22:50,110
You! Yes, you !

126
00:22:50,193 --> 00:22:52,040
Stand still, laddie!

127
00:23:15,247 --> 00:23:18,143
When we grew up and went to school

128
00:23:18,226 --> 00:23:23,724
There were certain teachers who would
hurt the children anyway they could

129
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:31,781
By pouring their derision
upon anything we did

130
00:23:31,865 --> 00:23:34,174
Exposing every weakness

131
00:23:34,215 --> 00:23:37,950
However carefully hidden
by the kids

132
00:23:38,035 --> 00:23:40,468
What have we here, laddie?

133
00:23:40,552 --> 00:23:43,784
Mysterious scribblings?
A secret code?

134
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,393
No. Poems, no less.

135
00:23:47,477 --> 00:23:49,617
Poems, everybody!

136
00:23:49,701 --> 00:23:51,883
The lad here reckons himself
a poet.

137
00:23:53,185 --> 00:23:56,163
"Money, get back.
I'm all right, Jack.

138
00:23:56,205 --> 00:23:59,436
Keep your hands
off my stack.

139
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:02,794
New car, caviar,
four-star daydream.

140
00:24:02,878 --> 00:24:06,068
Think I'll buy me
a football team."

141
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:08,753
Absolute rubbish, laddie!

142
00:24:08,795 --> 00:24:12,110
Get on with your work.

143
00:24:12,194 --> 00:24:13,831
Repeat after me:

144
00:24:13,914 --> 00:24:17,146
An acre is the area
of a rectangle...

145
00:24:17,189 --> 00:24:19,497
whose length is one furlong...

146
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:22,350
and whose width is one chain.

147
00:24:22,392 --> 00:24:24,701
But in this town it was well known

148
00:24:24,742 --> 00:24:29,106
When they got home at night
their fat and psychopathic wives

149
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:32,505
Would thrash them
within inches of their lives

150
00:24:51,181 --> 00:24:55,922
We don 't need no education

151
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:05,196
We don't need no thought control

152
00:25:09,645 --> 00:25:14,512
No dark sarcasm in the classroom

153
00:25:19,003 --> 00:25:22,948
Teacher, leave them kids alone

154
00:25:29,747 --> 00:25:34,111
Hey, teacher, leave them kids alone

155
00:25:38,433 --> 00:25:43,595
All in all it's just
another brick in the wall

156
00:25:45,189 --> 00:25:47,372
Wrong! Do it again !

157
00:25:47,455 --> 00:25:53,163
All in all you're just
another brick in the wall

158
00:25:56,730 --> 00:26:01,052
We don 't need no education

159
00:26:01,094 --> 00:26:04,074
If you don't eat your meat,
you can't have any pudding!

160
00:26:04,116 --> 00:26:07,432
We don't need no thought control

161
00:26:07,473 --> 00:26:10,285
How can you have any pudding
if you don't eat your meat?

162
00:26:10,368 --> 00:26:13,641
No dark sarcasm in the classroom

163
00:26:13,684 --> 00:26:16,327
You ! Yes, you, laddie!

164
00:26:16,371 --> 00:26:19,685
Poems, everybody.
The lad here reckons himself a poet.

165
00:26:19,726 --> 00:26:24,050
Teachers, leave them kids alone

166
00:26:30,177 --> 00:26:33,827
Hey, teacher, leave those kids alone

167
00:26:39,074 --> 00:26:44,066
All in all you're just
another brick in the wall

168
00:26:48,347 --> 00:26:52,795
All in all you're just
another brick in the wall

169
00:27:39,293 --> 00:27:43,532
We don 't need no education

170
00:27:57,926 --> 00:28:03,005
No dark sarcasm in the classroom

171
00:28:07,452 --> 00:28:11,858
Again. An acre is the area
of a rectangle...

172
00:28:11,942 --> 00:28:14,209
whose length is one furlong...

173
00:28:14,293 --> 00:28:17,062
and whose width is one chain.

174
00:29:10,275 --> 00:29:13,086
Mother, do you think
they'll drop the bomb

175
00:29:26,305 --> 00:29:29,494
Mother, do you think
they'll like the song

176
00:29:43,259 --> 00:29:47,833
Mother, do you think
they'll try to break my balls

177
00:29:58,366 --> 00:30:00,843
Mother, should I build the wall

178
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:31,645
Mother, should I run for president

179
00:30:45,158 --> 00:30:48,431
Mother, should I trust the government

180
00:31:02,155 --> 00:31:06,686
Mother, will they put me
in the firing line

181
00:31:16,883 --> 00:31:20,409
Mother, am I really dying

182
00:31:26,116 --> 00:31:30,397
Hush now, baby, baby
don't you cry

183
00:31:34,929 --> 00:31:40,510
Mama 's gonna make all of
your nightmares come true

184
00:31:40,594 --> 00:31:45,840
Mama 's gonna put
all of her fears into you

185
00:31:45,882 --> 00:31:51,128
Mama 's gonna keep you
right here under her wing

186
00:31:51,212 --> 00:31:56,457
She won 't let you fly
but she might let you sing

187
00:31:56,542 --> 00:32:02,500
Mama 's gonna keep baby cozy and warm

188
00:32:06,194 --> 00:32:09,593
Ooooh, babe

189
00:32:12,991 --> 00:32:15,593
Ooooh, babe

190
00:32:17,818 --> 00:32:23,105
Ooh, babe, of course
Mama 's gonna help build the wall

191
00:32:57,517 --> 00:33:04,525
Hello. Hello.
Is there anybody in there?

192
00:33:08,595 --> 00:33:10,274
Do you remember me?

193
00:33:10,316 --> 00:33:12,624
I'm the one
from the Registry Office.

194
00:33:23,745 --> 00:33:26,725
Mother, do you think
she's good enough

195
00:33:32,851 --> 00:33:34,782
For me

196
00:33:40,027 --> 00:33:43,679
And, Mother
do you think she 's dangerous

197
00:33:49,385 --> 00:33:52,072
To me

198
00:33:56,478 --> 00:34:01,052
Mother, will she tear
your little boy apart

199
00:34:07,473 --> 00:34:11,879
Ooooh, Ma

200
00:34:11,921 --> 00:34:14,398
Mother, will she break my heart

201
00:34:21,069 --> 00:34:24,804
Hush now, baby, baby
don't you cry

202
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:35,087
Mama 's gonna check out
all your girlfriends for you

203
00:34:35,170 --> 00:34:40,458
Mama won 't let anyone
dirty get through

204
00:34:40,542 --> 00:34:45,788
Mama 's gonna wait up
until you get in

205
00:34:45,829 --> 00:34:51,033
Mama will always find out
where you've been

206
00:34:51,116 --> 00:34:56,656
Mama 's gonna keep baby
healthy and clean

207
00:35:00,685 --> 00:35:04,588
Oooh, babe

208
00:35:07,442 --> 00:35:10,001
Oooh, babe

209
00:35:12,478 --> 00:35:17,513
Ooh, babe
You'll always be baby to me

210
00:35:31,111 --> 00:35:35,013
Mother, did it need to be so high

211
00:35:59,018 --> 00:36:00,612
- Hello?
- Yes, a collect call...

212
00:36:00,695 --> 00:36:02,921
for Mrs. Floyd from Mr. Floyd.

213
00:36:03,004 --> 00:36:06,025
Will you accept the charge
from the United States?

214
00:36:11,564 --> 00:36:13,915
I wonder why he hung up. Is there
supposed to be someone else there...

215
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,055
besides your wife, sir,
to answer?

216
00:36:19,832 --> 00:36:22,224
- Hello?
- This is United States calling.

217
00:36:22,308 --> 00:36:24,322
Are we reaching--

218
00:36:26,882 --> 00:36:30,365
See, he keeps hanging up,
and it's a man answering.

219
00:38:14,523 --> 00:38:18,971
What shall we use

220
00:38:19,055 --> 00:38:21,574
To fill

221
00:38:21,657 --> 00:38:26,567
The empty spaces

222
00:38:26,652 --> 00:38:29,086
Where waves

223
00:38:29,169 --> 00:38:31,771
Of hunger

224
00:38:31,855 --> 00:38:34,583
Roar

225
00:38:34,667 --> 00:38:38,570
Shall we set out across

226
00:38:38,612 --> 00:38:41,297
This sea

227
00:38:41,339 --> 00:38:44,612
Of faces

228
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:48,683
In search of more

229
00:38:48,767 --> 00:38:53,760
And more applause

230
00:39:12,268 --> 00:39:16,884
Shall we buy a new guitar

231
00:39:16,968 --> 00:39:21,542
Shall we drive
a more powerful car

232
00:39:21,584 --> 00:39:26,243
Shall we work
straight through the night

233
00:39:26,326 --> 00:39:28,466
Shall we get into fights

234
00:39:28,551 --> 00:39:31,151
Leave the lights on
Drop bombs

235
00:39:31,236 --> 00:39:35,601
Do tours of the East
Contract diseases

236
00:39:35,685 --> 00:39:38,035
Bury bones
Break up homes

237
00:39:38,076 --> 00:39:40,384
Send flowers by phone

238
00:39:40,426 --> 00:39:42,734
Take to drink
Go to shrinks

239
00:39:42,776 --> 00:39:45,043
Give up meat
Rarely sleep

240
00:39:45,085 --> 00:39:47,266
Keep people as pets

241
00:39:47,351 --> 00:39:49,659
Train dogs
Race rats

242
00:39:49,742 --> 00:39:51,967
Fill the attic with cash

243
00:39:52,050 --> 00:39:53,981
Bury treasure
Store up leisure

244
00:39:54,064 --> 00:39:58,807
But never relax at all

245
00:40:00,108 --> 00:40:03,297
With our backs to the wall

246
00:40:38,045 --> 00:40:41,402
I am just a new boy

247
00:40:43,123 --> 00:40:45,515
A stranger in this town

248
00:40:48,158 --> 00:40:51,222
Where are all the good times

249
00:40:53,236 --> 00:40:57,265
Who 's gonna show this stranger around

250
00:41:08,511 --> 00:41:12,498
Ooooh

251
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:14,512
I need a dirty woman

252
00:41:18,752 --> 00:41:22,696
Ooooh

253
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:24,710
I need a dirty girl

254
00:41:28,991 --> 00:41:31,677
Will some woman in this desert land

255
00:41:34,068 --> 00:41:38,390
Make me feel like a real man

256
00:41:38,475 --> 00:41:41,329
Take this rock and roll refugee

257
00:41:43,972 --> 00:41:46,952
Ooh, babe, set me free

258
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:03,319
Ooooh

259
00:42:03,402 --> 00:42:05,795
I need a dirty woman

260
00:42:09,655 --> 00:42:13,558
Ooooh

261
00:42:13,641 --> 00:42:15,572
I need a dirty girl

262
00:43:05,595 --> 00:43:09,540
Ooooh

263
00:43:09,623 --> 00:43:11,680
I need a dirty woman

264
00:43:15,708 --> 00:43:19,738
Ooooh

265
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:22,129
I need a dirty girl

266
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,534
Oh, my God.

267
00:43:56,708 --> 00:43:59,185
What a fabulous room.

268
00:44:03,129 --> 00:44:04,977
- Are all these your guitars?

269
00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:21,552
- God.

270
00:44:21,637 --> 00:44:24,532
This place is bigger
than our whole apartment.

271
00:44:38,044 --> 00:44:40,437
- You like the tube, huh?

272
00:44:43,458 --> 00:44:46,480
Can I get a drink of water?

273
00:44:49,712 --> 00:44:53,321
- Can I get you a drink of water?

274
00:45:09,225 --> 00:45:12,792
- Oh, wow, look at this tub!

275
00:45:12,876 --> 00:45:15,310
Wanna take a bath?

276
00:45:25,885 --> 00:45:29,536
- What are you watching?

277
00:45:35,579 --> 00:45:38,433
- Hello? Hello?

278
00:45:45,315 --> 00:45:47,455
- You feeling okay?

279
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:51,275
Day after day

280
00:45:51,358 --> 00:45:54,085
Love turns grey

281
00:45:54,170 --> 00:45:57,779
Like the skin of a dying man

282
00:46:01,346 --> 00:46:04,200
And night after night

283
00:46:04,284 --> 00:46:07,935
We pretend it's all right

284
00:46:07,977 --> 00:46:11,375
But I have grown older

285
00:46:11,461 --> 00:46:14,733
And you have grown colder

286
00:46:14,816 --> 00:46:20,314
And nothing is very much fun anymore

287
00:46:21,532 --> 00:46:27,029
And I can feel

288
00:46:28,246 --> 00:46:32,191
One of my turns coming on

289
00:46:35,002 --> 00:46:38,107
I

290
00:46:38,192 --> 00:46:41,465
Feel

291
00:46:41,550 --> 00:46:44,905
Cold as a razor blade

292
00:46:44,948 --> 00:46:48,263
Tight as a tourniquet

293
00:46:48,347 --> 00:46:52,334
Dry as a funeral drum

294
00:46:56,783 --> 00:46:58,713
Run to the bedroom

295
00:46:58,797 --> 00:47:03,917
In the suitcase on the left
you'll find my favorite axe

296
00:47:07,652 --> 00:47:12,099
Don 't look so frightened
This is just a passing phase

297
00:47:12,184 --> 00:47:15,331
One of my bad days

298
00:47:17,974 --> 00:47:21,206
Would you like to watch TV

299
00:47:21,290 --> 00:47:26,872
Or get between the sheets
Or contemplate the silent freeway

300
00:47:26,955 --> 00:47:29,557
Would you like something to eat

301
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:32,495
Would you like to learn to fly

302
00:47:34,048 --> 00:47:37,320
Would ya
Would you like to see me try

303
00:48:13,453 --> 00:48:16,138
Would you like to call the cops

304
00:48:16,223 --> 00:48:19,832
- Do you think it's time I stopped
- Next time, fuckers!

305
00:48:19,915 --> 00:48:25,917
Why are you running away

306
00:49:25,172 --> 00:49:27,984
Oooh, babe

307
00:49:31,088 --> 00:49:33,691
Don 't leave me now

308
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:45,231
How could you go

309
00:49:55,555 --> 00:49:58,912
When you know how I need you

310
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:12,761
To beat to a pulp
on a Saturday night

311
00:50:12,844 --> 00:50:18,174
Oh, babe

312
00:50:18,259 --> 00:50:21,027
Don 't leave me now

313
00:50:34,288 --> 00:50:38,065
How can you treat me this way

314
00:50:41,632 --> 00:50:43,689
Running away

315
00:50:50,446 --> 00:50:54,851
Ooh, babe

316
00:50:56,446 --> 00:51:00,726
Why are you running away

317
00:51:00,768 --> 00:51:07,944
Oooh, babe

318
00:51:12,478 --> 00:51:19,737
Oooh, babe

319
00:51:52,890 --> 00:51:57,045
I don 't need no arms around me

320
00:52:01,409 --> 00:52:05,689
And I don't need
no drugs to calm me

321
00:52:10,389 --> 00:52:15,804
I have seen the writing on the wall

322
00:52:18,825 --> 00:52:23,986
Don 't think I need anything at all

323
00:52:27,679 --> 00:52:30,029
No

324
00:52:30,071 --> 00:52:32,757
Don't think I need anything at all

325
00:52:41,359 --> 00:52:45,430
All and all it was all
just bricks in the wall

326
00:52:49,418 --> 00:52:54,453
All and all you were all
just bricks in the wall

327
00:53:24,962 --> 00:53:29,284
Good-bye, cruel world

328
00:53:29,369 --> 00:53:32,180
I'm leaving you today

329
00:53:34,027 --> 00:53:38,600
Good-bye, good-bye

330
00:53:38,685 --> 00:53:40,615
Good-bye

331
00:53:48,756 --> 00:53:53,121
Good-bye, all you people

332
00:53:53,205 --> 00:53:57,234
There's nothing you can say

333
00:53:57,317 --> 00:54:02,438
To make me change my mind

334
00:54:02,521 --> 00:54:04,787
Good-bye

335
00:54:31,897 --> 00:54:34,289
Is there anybody out there

336
00:54:44,696 --> 00:54:46,501
Is there anybody out there

337
00:54:56,111 --> 00:54:58,922
Is there anybody out there

338
00:55:10,631 --> 00:55:13,821
Is there anybody out there

339
00:58:16,748 --> 00:58:21,405
I've got a little black book
with my poems in

340
00:58:21,489 --> 00:58:26,064
Got a bag with a toothbrush
and a comb in

341
00:58:26,147 --> 00:58:31,939
When I'm a good dog
they sometimes throw me a bone in

342
00:58:34,667 --> 00:58:39,198
I got elastic bands
keeping my shoes on

343
00:58:39,283 --> 00:58:43,731
Got those swollen-hand blues

344
00:58:43,814 --> 00:58:50,236
I've got 13 channels of shit
on the TV to choose from

345
00:58:52,795 --> 00:58:55,649
I've got electric light

346
00:58:59,301 --> 00:59:01,986
And I've got second sight

347
00:59:02,070 --> 00:59:07,945
I've got amazing powers
of observation

348
00:59:13,065 --> 00:59:15,624
And that is how I know

349
00:59:16,799 --> 00:59:20,031
When I try to get through

350
00:59:21,793 --> 00:59:23,388
On the telephone to you

351
00:59:28,340 --> 00:59:31,362
- There 'll be nobody home

352
00:59:38,538 --> 00:59:43,279
- I got the obligatory Hendrix perm

353
00:59:43,364 --> 00:59:48,441
And the inevitable pinhole burns

354
00:59:48,483 --> 00:59:54,107
All down the front
of my favorite satin shirt

355
00:59:56,666 --> 01:00:01,577
I've got nicotine stains
on my fingers

356
01:00:01,619 --> 01:00:06,361
I've got a silver spoon on a chain

357
01:00:06,445 --> 01:00:11,985
Got a grand piano
to prop up my mortal remains

358
01:00:14,963 --> 01:00:20,670
I got wild staring eyes

359
01:00:20,713 --> 01:00:23,651
And I got a strong urge to fly

360
01:00:26,924 --> 01:00:30,449
But I got nowhere to fly to

361
01:00:38,674 --> 01:00:43,669
Oooh, babe

362
01:00:43,752 --> 01:00:47,236
When I pick up the phone

363
01:00:50,425 --> 01:00:53,488
There's still nobody home

364
01:01:00,664 --> 01:01:05,280
I've got a pair of Gohills boots

365
01:01:05,364 --> 01:01:09,602
And I got fading roots

366
01:03:37,615 --> 01:03:43,826
Does anybody here
remember Vera Lynn

367
01:03:48,526 --> 01:03:51,253
Remember how she said

368
01:03:51,337 --> 01:03:54,946
That we would meet again

369
01:03:55,030 --> 01:03:58,514
Some sunny day

370
01:04:22,895 --> 01:04:25,161
Vera

371
01:04:25,245 --> 01:04:28,476
Vera

372
01:04:30,113 --> 01:04:33,387
What has become of you

373
01:04:38,296 --> 01:04:41,989
Does anybody else in here

374
01:04:42,073 --> 01:04:44,339
Feel the way I do

375
01:05:05,784 --> 01:05:09,938
Bring the boys back home

376
01:05:14,806 --> 01:05:19,296
Bring the boys back home

377
01:05:23,535 --> 01:05:26,683
Don 't leave the children

378
01:05:26,725 --> 01:05:31,299
On their own, no, no

379
01:05:35,579 --> 01:05:40,321
Bring the boys back home

380
01:05:45,021 --> 01:05:49,385
Bring the boys back home

381
01:05:53,037 --> 01:05:55,723
- You feeling okay?

382
01:06:05,081 --> 01:06:08,565
Is there anybody out there

383
01:06:08,606 --> 01:06:10,830
- Fuck me.

384
01:06:10,914 --> 01:06:14,146
He's gone completely around
the bleedin' twist.

385
01:06:14,229 --> 01:06:17,124
You vicious bastard,
you never did like me, did you?

386
01:06:18,551 --> 01:06:20,818
Hello

387
01:06:20,859 --> 01:06:23,378
Is there anybody in there

388
01:06:24,972 --> 01:06:29,463
Just nod if you can hear me

389
01:06:29,547 --> 01:06:31,813
Is there anyone at home

390
01:06:33,786 --> 01:06:37,017
Come on, now

391
01:06:37,100 --> 01:06:41,339
I hear you're feeling down

392
01:06:41,422 --> 01:06:44,235
Well, I can ease your pain

393
01:06:44,318 --> 01:06:48,851
- And get you on your feet again
- The boy's an asthmatic.

394
01:06:48,934 --> 01:06:51,915
- Asthmatic!?
- Relax

395
01:06:51,998 --> 01:06:56,530
- I'll need some information first
- He's an artist!

396
01:06:56,614 --> 01:06:59,930
Just the basic facts

397
01:07:00,013 --> 01:07:04,335
Can you show me where it hurts

398
01:07:04,421 --> 01:07:09,329
There is no pain
you are receding

399
01:07:12,436 --> 01:07:16,841
A distant ship smoke
on the horizon

400
01:07:19,948 --> 01:07:24,395
You are only coming through in waves

401
01:07:26,998 --> 01:07:28,970
Your lips move

402
01:07:29,012 --> 01:07:31,907
But I can't hear what you're saying

403
01:07:34,719 --> 01:07:37,614
When I was a child

404
01:07:37,698 --> 01:07:40,049
I had a fever

405
01:07:42,273 --> 01:07:48,148
My hands felt just like two balloons

406
01:07:50,204 --> 01:07:54,819
Now I've got that feeling once again

407
01:07:54,905 --> 01:07:59,059
I can 't explain
you would not understand

408
01:07:59,143 --> 01:08:02,710
This is not how I am

409
01:08:05,521 --> 01:08:10,180
I

410
01:08:10,264 --> 01:08:13,705
Have become comfortably numb

411
01:08:47,403 --> 01:08:52,396
I

412
01:08:52,481 --> 01:08:55,292
Have become comfortably numb

413
01:08:59,069 --> 01:09:01,587
Okay

414
01:09:01,671 --> 01:09:03,938
Just a little pinprick

415
01:09:05,532 --> 01:09:09,477
There'll be no more
Aaaaah

416
01:09:09,561 --> 01:09:12,331
But you may feel a little sick

417
01:09:13,590 --> 01:09:16,862
Can you stand up

418
01:09:16,946 --> 01:09:19,381
I do believe it's working

419
01:09:19,464 --> 01:09:20,681
- Good
- He's coming around.

420
01:09:20,766 --> 01:09:25,717
-That'll keep you going through the show
-There, you see?

421
01:09:25,801 --> 01:09:29,410
- Come on, it's time to go
- How do you feel?

422
01:09:29,493 --> 01:09:34,614
There is no pain
you are receding

423
01:09:37,509 --> 01:09:41,832
A distant ship smoke
on the horizon

424
01:09:44,895 --> 01:09:49,218
You are only coming through in waves

425
01:09:52,029 --> 01:09:53,959
Your lips move

426
01:09:54,044 --> 01:09:57,023
But I can't hear what you're saying

427
01:09:59,667 --> 01:10:02,647
When I was a child

428
01:10:02,731 --> 01:10:05,458
I caught a fleeting glimpse

429
01:10:08,019 --> 01:10:12,382
Out of the corner of my eye

430
01:10:15,446 --> 01:10:19,475
I turned to look
but it was gone

431
01:10:19,559 --> 01:10:24,302
I cannot put my finger on it now

432
01:10:24,385 --> 01:10:28,539
The child is grown
The dream is gone

433
01:10:30,470 --> 01:10:35,127
I

434
01:10:35,212 --> 01:10:39,829
Have become comfortably numb

435
01:14:18,384 --> 01:14:21,406
So ya thought ya

436
01:14:21,489 --> 01:14:24,552
Might like to go to the show

437
01:14:28,119 --> 01:14:31,813
To feel the warm thrill
of confusion

438
01:14:31,896 --> 01:14:34,793
That space cadet glow

439
01:14:38,023 --> 01:14:42,388
I got some bad news for you, sunshine

440
01:14:42,473 --> 01:14:46,542
Pink isn 't well
He's, uh, back at the hotel

441
01:14:46,627 --> 01:14:49,690
And they sent us along
as a surrogate band

442
01:14:49,774 --> 01:14:54,180
Now tonight, we 're gonna find out
where you fans really stand

443
01:14:57,453 --> 01:15:00,181
Are there any queers
in the audience tonight

444
01:15:02,195 --> 01:15:06,518
- Get 'em up against the wall
- Against the wall

445
01:15:06,602 --> 01:15:09,791
There's one in the spotlight
he don 't look right

446
01:15:12,058 --> 01:15:16,589
- Have him up against the wall
- Against the wall

447
01:15:16,674 --> 01:15:21,079
And that one looks Jewish
And that one's a coon

448
01:15:21,165 --> 01:15:24,731
Who let all this riffraff
into the room

449
01:15:24,814 --> 01:15:26,997
There's one smoking a joint

450
01:15:27,082 --> 01:15:31,236
And that one's got spots

451
01:15:31,320 --> 01:15:35,474
If I had my way
I'd have all of you shot

452
01:17:07,210 --> 01:17:10,903
Run, run, run, run

453
01:17:10,987 --> 01:17:15,310
Run, run, run, run

454
01:17:23,200 --> 01:17:27,270
You better make your face up
in your favorite disguise

455
01:17:27,354 --> 01:17:31,845
With your button-down lips
and your roller-blind eyes

456
01:17:31,929 --> 01:17:35,999
With your empty smile
and your hungry heart

457
01:17:36,083 --> 01:17:39,943
Feel the bile rising
from your guilty past

458
01:17:40,028 --> 01:17:44,182
With your nerves in tatters
as the cockleshell shatters

459
01:17:44,224 --> 01:17:48,043
And the hammers batter down your door

460
01:17:48,085 --> 01:17:52,869
You better run
run, run, run

461
01:17:52,953 --> 01:17:56,982
Run, run, run, run

462
01:17:57,065 --> 01:18:01,094
Run, run, run, run

463
01:18:04,745 --> 01:18:08,773
You better run all day
and run all night

464
01:18:08,857 --> 01:18:12,844
Keep your dirty feelings deep inside

465
01:18:12,885 --> 01:18:16,957
And if you're taking
your girlfriend out tonight

466
01:18:17,041 --> 01:18:21,405
You'd better park the car
well out of sight

467
01:18:21,490 --> 01:18:25,350
'Cause if they catch you in
the back seat trying to pick her locks

468
01:18:25,434 --> 01:18:29,462
They're gonna send you back to Mother
in a cardboard box

469
01:18:29,547 --> 01:18:31,476
You better run

470
01:19:03,664 --> 01:19:06,014
You cannot reach me now

471
01:19:10,127 --> 01:19:13,988
No matter how you try

472
01:19:15,330 --> 01:19:18,226
Good-bye, cruel world

473
01:19:18,311 --> 01:19:20,828
It's over

474
01:19:20,913 --> 01:19:22,800
Walk on by

475
01:19:27,249 --> 01:19:29,221
Waiting

476
01:19:29,263 --> 01:19:32,411
- To cut out the dead wood
- Waiting

477
01:19:32,452 --> 01:19:35,810
- To weed out the weaklings
- Waiting

478
01:19:35,893 --> 01:19:39,587
To smash in their windows
and kick in their doors

479
01:19:39,670 --> 01:19:44,118
- Waiting
- For the final solution
to strengthen the strain

480
01:19:44,203 --> 01:19:47,895
- Waiting
- To follow the worms

481
01:19:51,211 --> 01:19:54,527
- Would you like to see
- Would you like to see

482
01:19:54,610 --> 01:19:57,968
Britannia rule again

483
01:20:00,233 --> 01:20:01,577
My friend

484
01:20:04,388 --> 01:20:09,340
All you need to do
is follow the worms

485
01:20:52,900 --> 01:20:55,964
Hammer! Hammer!

486
01:20:56,047 --> 01:20:59,405
Hammer! Hammer!

487
01:21:15,561 --> 01:21:20,304
Hammer! Hammer! Hammer!

488
01:21:20,387 --> 01:21:23,283
Stop!

489
01:23:14,743 --> 01:23:16,380
Stop.

490
01:23:22,716 --> 01:23:24,647
I wanna go home

491
01:23:28,634 --> 01:23:33,627
Take off this uniform
and leave the show

492
01:23:36,272 --> 01:23:40,426
But I'm waiting in this cell

493
01:23:40,510 --> 01:23:43,741
Because I have to know

494
01:23:45,293 --> 01:23:48,777
Have I been

495
01:23:48,819 --> 01:23:54,317
Have I been guilty all this time

496
01:24:45,347 --> 01:24:48,284
Good morning, Worm, Your Honor

497
01:24:48,368 --> 01:24:50,719
The crown will plainly show

498
01:24:50,802 --> 01:24:54,622
The prisoner who now stands before you

499
01:24:54,705 --> 01:24:59,614
Was caught red-handed showing feelings

500
01:24:59,657 --> 01:25:05,238
Showing feelings
of an almost human nature

501
01:25:05,321 --> 01:25:09,099
This will not do

502
01:25:09,182 --> 01:25:11,407
Call the schoolmaster

503
01:25:11,491 --> 01:25:14,471
I always said he'd come to no good

504
01:25:14,554 --> 01:25:17,031
In the end, Your Honor

505
01:25:17,073 --> 01:25:19,548
If they'd let me have my way

506
01:25:19,632 --> 01:25:23,912
I could have flayed him into shape

507
01:25:23,955 --> 01:25:26,892
But my hands were tied

508
01:25:26,976 --> 01:25:29,368
The bleeding hearts and artists

509
01:25:29,452 --> 01:25:32,851
Let him get away with murder

510
01:25:32,935 --> 01:25:36,082
Let me hammer him today

511
01:25:38,517 --> 01:25:41,916
Crazy

512
01:25:41,958 --> 01:25:48,042
Toys in the attic
I am crazy

513
01:25:48,127 --> 01:25:51,316
Truly gone fishing

514
01:25:55,177 --> 01:26:01,135
They must have taken my marbles away

515
01:26:01,220 --> 01:26:04,577
Crazy

516
01:26:04,661 --> 01:26:10,955
Toys in the attic
He is crazy

517
01:26:15,489 --> 01:26:18,510
You little shit
You're in it now

518
01:26:18,594 --> 01:26:21,866
I hope they throw away the key

519
01:26:21,908 --> 01:26:26,232
You should've talked to me
more often than you did

520
01:26:26,274 --> 01:26:29,966
But no
You had to go your own way

521
01:26:30,050 --> 01:26:33,492
Have you broken
any homes up lately

522
01:26:33,576 --> 01:26:36,848
Just five minutes, Worm, Your Honor

523
01:26:36,932 --> 01:26:39,870
Him and me alone

524
01:26:41,465 --> 01:26:47,633
Babe

525
01:26:47,718 --> 01:26:49,941
Come to Mother, baby

526
01:26:50,026 --> 01:26:53,802
Let me hold you in my arms

527
01:26:53,886 --> 01:26:59,425
M'lud, I never wanted him
to get in any trouble

528
01:26:59,467 --> 01:27:02,741
Why'd he ever have to leave me

529
01:27:02,825 --> 01:27:06,854
Worm, Your Honor
let me take him home

530
01:27:08,532 --> 01:27:11,680
Crazy

531
01:27:11,764 --> 01:27:18,227
Over the rainbow
I'm crazy

532
01:27:18,268 --> 01:27:21,667
Bars in the window

533
01:27:24,521 --> 01:27:29,641
There must have been a door there
in the wall

534
01:27:29,725 --> 01:27:34,635
- When I came in
- Crazy

535
01:27:34,718 --> 01:27:40,846
Over the rainbow
He is crazy

536
01:27:44,791 --> 01:27:51,001
The evidence before the court
is incontrovertible

537
01:27:51,085 --> 01:27:55,198
There 's no need
for the jury to retire

538
01:27:57,464 --> 01:28:00,108
In all my years of judging

539
01:28:00,192 --> 01:28:03,424
I have never heard before

540
01:28:03,507 --> 01:28:06,109
Of someone more deserving

541
01:28:06,192 --> 01:28:10,179
The full penalty of law

542
01:28:10,263 --> 01:28:12,698
The way you made them suffer

543
01:28:12,782 --> 01:28:16,517
Your exquisite wife and mother

544
01:28:16,558 --> 01:28:19,999
Fills me with the urge to defecate

545
01:28:22,811 --> 01:28:28,560
Since, my friend
you have revealed your deepest fear

546
01:28:28,602 --> 01:28:32,463
I sentence you to be exposed

547
01:28:32,504 --> 01:28:35,568
Before your peers

548
01:28:35,653 --> 01:28:38,800
Tear down the wall

549
01:28:38,842 --> 01:28:42,115
Tear down the wall

550
01:31:45,840 --> 01:31:48,357
All alone

551
01:31:48,399 --> 01:31:50,371
Or in two's

552
01:31:52,134 --> 01:31:56,205
The ones who really love you

553
01:32:00,234 --> 01:32:03,172
Walk up and down

554
01:32:03,255 --> 01:32:05,186
Outside the wall

555
01:32:11,018 --> 01:32:15,005
Some hand in hand

556
01:32:16,935 --> 01:32:21,259
Some gathered together in bands

557
01:32:23,818 --> 01:32:29,148
The bleeding hearts
and the artists

558
01:32:29,190 --> 01:32:31,162
Make their stand

559
01:32:34,980 --> 01:32:40,395
And when they've given you their all

560
01:32:40,478 --> 01:32:43,332
Some stagger and fall

561
01:32:43,416 --> 01:32:46,858
After all, it's not easy

562
01:32:49,123 --> 01:32:51,641
Banging your heart

563
01:32:51,725 --> 01:32:56,299
Against some mad bugger's wall

564
01:34:15,026 --> 01:34:20,231
When they've given you their all

565
01:34:20,273 --> 01:34:22,916
Some stagger and fall

566
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:26,399
After all, it's not easy



9999
