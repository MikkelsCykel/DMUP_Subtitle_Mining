1
00:03:31,421 --> 00:03:33,465
How ya doin'?

2
00:03:38,762 --> 00:03:41,223
That's for you.

3
00:03:44,685 --> 00:03:47,688
- You sure you're up for this?
- Yeah.

4
00:03:49,481 --> 00:03:54,153
- So, see you tonight, right?
- Yeah.

5
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:58,949
- Everything all right?
- Yeah.

6
00:03:59,658 --> 00:04:02,703
- So I'll see you tonight.
- OK.

7
00:04:11,253 --> 00:04:15,173
<i>- What happened to you?
- What does it look like?</i>

8
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:17,050
I don't know.

9
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:23,265
I had this pit bull, right?
Joe. Joe the dog.

10
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:27,436
I go to feed the fuck, right?
I put his bowl down, he goes nuts.

11
00:04:27,561 --> 00:04:30,230
Bites my fucking thumb off.
19 stitches.

12
00:04:30,355 --> 00:04:32,858
I'm in the hospital three days.

13
00:04:34,735 --> 00:04:37,112
I get out. I get my gun.

14
00:04:37,237 --> 00:04:41,909
I go to him "You like to bite things?"
Bite this. " I put the gun in his mouth.

15
00:04:42,034 --> 00:04:44,369
Bam! I blow him
all over the apartment.

16
00:04:44,494 --> 00:04:46,955
- Ever see a dog explode?
- They're here.

17
00:04:58,175 --> 00:05:03,263
This neighbourhood's a real shit hole.
I don't know why you had to meet here.

18
00:05:03,388 --> 00:05:06,933
We'll do the next meeting at
Tavern on the Green, all right?

19
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:12,856
- How you doin', Noonan?
- I'm cold. Let's get this over with.

20
00:05:12,981 --> 00:05:15,025
- Fine. Let's see the stuff.
- Show 'em.

21
00:05:20,822 --> 00:05:24,534
- Let's see the money.
- We'll take this at a little discount.

22
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:28,497
- I knew this shit was gonna happen.
- This is fucking bullshit.

23
00:05:28,622 --> 00:05:31,208
What are you gonna do?
Are you gonna shoot me?

24
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:33,502
- I'll shoot him.
- Don't point that at me.

25
00:05:33,627 --> 00:05:35,545
We'll walk away. This is bullshit.

26
00:05:35,671 --> 00:05:38,131
<i>Give me the bag.
I want to shoot you.</i>

27
00:05:38,256 --> 00:05:40,634
Shoot him.
I'll take this and get the fuck...

28
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:44,471
Did you hear what I said?
I said give me the fucking bag.

29
00:05:44,596 --> 00:05:47,015
Don't be a fool.
Give me the bag. You want to die?

30
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:48,850
- Shut up.
- Want me to shoot him?

31
00:05:48,975 --> 00:05:51,269
- I don't give a fuck.
- I'll shoot you now.

32
00:05:51,395 --> 00:05:53,397
Give me the fucking bag!

33
00:05:53,522 --> 00:05:55,899
- Let's go.
- Want to fucking get shot?

34
00:05:56,024 --> 00:05:58,235
Give me that fucking bag!

35
00:06:11,873 --> 00:06:14,167
- Jesus Christ...
- What happened back there?

36
00:06:14,292 --> 00:06:16,128
- What?
- Nothing, right?

37
00:06:16,253 --> 00:06:17,879
I don't... No! No!

38
00:06:18,004 --> 00:06:20,382
- Do you know me?
- No, I don't know ya!

39
00:06:20,507 --> 00:06:23,135
All right, put me
in a subway station. Go!

40
00:08:02,108 --> 00:08:05,320
He's wearing a silk suit.
He's got crocodile shoes.

41
00:08:05,445 --> 00:08:10,158
I said "I don't care what fucking shoes
you wear. You're still a crack dealer. "

42
00:08:10,283 --> 00:08:14,204
The guy says "I didn't know
I was in your neighbourhood, man. "

43
00:08:14,329 --> 00:08:16,331
Like his balls were in his throat.

44
00:08:16,456 --> 00:08:19,668
"Don't go to pieces" I tell him.
Then he gets the joke.

45
00:08:23,546 --> 00:08:26,257
- Who the fuck is this?
- What do you want?

46
00:08:26,383 --> 00:08:28,593
- Whatever you're having.
- Fuck you.

47
00:08:35,684 --> 00:08:39,688
Trying to hurt my feelings?
Won't introduce me to your friends?

48
00:08:40,563 --> 00:08:43,149
- Terry?
- That took you fucking long enough.

49
00:08:43,274 --> 00:08:45,485
Terry Noonan. Terry.

50
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:47,862
- Terry Noonan.
- Hey, motherfucker.

51
00:08:47,987 --> 00:08:51,032
You fuckin'... Come here, come here.

52
00:08:52,575 --> 00:08:55,870
Where you fuckin' been, man? Oh, man.

53
00:08:59,499 --> 00:09:02,377
- It's great to fucking see ya.
- Hey.

54
00:09:02,502 --> 00:09:06,840
This is my best fucking friend.
See, I love this fucking guy.

55
00:09:06,965 --> 00:09:09,759
Where you been, fucking Mars?
You're looking good.

56
00:09:10,343 --> 00:09:12,595
I gotta take my lord here for a stroll.

57
00:09:12,721 --> 00:09:14,889
- I gotta talk to you.
- Wanna go somewhere?

58
00:09:15,014 --> 00:09:16,224
- Yeah.
- OK.

59
00:09:16,349 --> 00:09:18,518
Hey, catch you guys later, all right?

60
00:09:19,144 --> 00:09:21,980
Give me this, give me this.

61
00:09:22,105 --> 00:09:24,232
<i>You're a fucking prick.</i>

62
00:09:26,776 --> 00:09:31,823
Where'd our fucking neighbourhood go?
I don't even recognise the place.

63
00:09:31,948 --> 00:09:36,077
A bunch of yuppie condos.
They could've left ten blocks for the Irish.

64
00:09:36,202 --> 00:09:39,581
They don't even want to call it
Hell's Kitchen no more.

65
00:09:39,706 --> 00:09:44,002
Renamed it Clinton.
Sounds like a fucking steamboat.

66
00:09:50,216 --> 00:09:52,260
These guys you dropped.

67
00:09:54,262 --> 00:09:57,932
- The guy you were with, this...
- My partner? DeMarco.

68
00:09:58,975 --> 00:10:02,312
DeMarco? Can you trust him?

69
00:10:02,437 --> 00:10:05,940
He might as well have done it himself,
Jack. Who's he gonna tell?

70
00:10:06,065 --> 00:10:10,153
Who's he gonna tell?
Anybody he fucking wants.

71
00:10:10,278 --> 00:10:14,324
Terry, this guy, this DeMarco,

72
00:10:14,449 --> 00:10:17,744
he gets into a little trouble
with the cops, right?

73
00:10:17,869 --> 00:10:21,664
He'd trade everything he knows
about you for a slice of pizza.

74
00:10:21,789 --> 00:10:23,833
Wake up.

75
00:10:29,255 --> 00:10:32,217
Would you ask Mikey
if he'd throw me something?

76
00:10:33,134 --> 00:10:35,720
Mikey met with a little accident.

77
00:10:35,845 --> 00:10:38,765
So did Flynn.
Frankie's running the show now.

78
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:42,560
- Frankie's the boss?
- My big brother is the boss.

79
00:10:42,685 --> 00:10:44,854
- Frank's the boss?
- Yeah.

80
00:10:46,189 --> 00:10:50,818
He's trying to put this deal together
with the Italians. This guy Borelli.

81
00:10:50,944 --> 00:10:53,238
- Joe Borelli?
- You heard of him?

82
00:10:53,905 --> 00:10:56,324
We're like that.

83
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:59,786
- Hey, you want another beer?
- I'd love one.

84
00:11:10,254 --> 00:11:11,923
Cheers.

85
00:11:14,217 --> 00:11:16,761
Is your sister still around?

86
00:11:16,886 --> 00:11:19,013
No, Kate moved way the fuck uptown.

87
00:11:20,306 --> 00:11:23,142
- You wouldn't recognise her.
- Yeah?

88
00:11:25,395 --> 00:11:27,105
Terry.

89
00:11:28,398 --> 00:11:30,441
Check this out.

90
00:11:39,701 --> 00:11:42,537
- What the fuck is that?
- It's...

91
00:11:43,496 --> 00:11:48,126
It's Frankie's idea.
You got your favourite gun, right?

92
00:11:48,251 --> 00:11:53,005
He got tired of tossing away
a perfectly good piece after every job.

93
00:11:53,131 --> 00:11:55,216
You take your hands,

94
00:11:56,467 --> 00:11:59,512
and you take your gun.

95
00:11:59,637 --> 00:12:03,391
You put the prints on the gun,
you stash it.

96
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:08,855
The cops find the gun.
They're lookin' for a dead man.

97
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:11,107
- This is somebody's hands?!
- Yeah.

98
00:12:11,232 --> 00:12:14,861
- What are you touching 'em for?!
- Terry, meet Flynn.

99
00:12:14,986 --> 00:12:17,947
Don't fuck with me.
No, don't fuck with me.

100
00:12:19,073 --> 00:12:23,494
<i>Don't! Don't! You're gonna get... Fuck!</i>

101
00:12:23,619 --> 00:12:27,749
- That's somebody's hands!
- Are you scared?

102
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,544
- Get the fuck...!
- All right, hands up.

103
00:12:31,669 --> 00:12:34,505
- Put 'em back.
- They're in. They're in.

104
00:12:34,964 --> 00:12:37,759
- They're in. All right?
- You're a sick pup.

105
00:12:37,884 --> 00:12:40,011
- I know.
- You're a very sick pup.

106
00:12:40,136 --> 00:12:42,346
What's this? Come here.

107
00:12:45,475 --> 00:12:47,059
Sweet.

108
00:12:47,185 --> 00:12:50,605
See this gun I got here?
I love this fucking gun.

109
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:57,195
- I usually shoot straight when I'm drunk.
- You mean you were aiming?

110
00:13:01,574 --> 00:13:05,953
Thank God you're back. I was feeling like
the last fucking Irishman in the Kitchen.

111
00:13:07,997 --> 00:13:11,334
Terry, you've been away
too long. You gotta wake up.

112
00:13:11,459 --> 00:13:15,755
Never do business with a greaser.
The cops get him, they got an eyewitness.

113
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:19,675
And an eyewitness puts you away.
Unless it's around here.

114
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,803
The cops can't do shit around here.

115
00:13:22,929 --> 00:13:26,641
Now, me and Frankie took
this union guy out last year.

116
00:13:26,766 --> 00:13:29,435
Went up to him on the street,
popped his button.

117
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:32,438
There must've been 50 witnesses.

118
00:13:32,563 --> 00:13:35,358
Cops were all over the Kitchen
asking questions.

119
00:13:35,483 --> 00:13:38,903
This one asshole raised his hand.

120
00:13:39,987 --> 00:13:45,201
Cops found his head spinning
inside a washer- dryer over on 47th.

121
00:13:45,326 --> 00:13:47,411
Haven't heard from the cops in a year.

122
00:13:47,536 --> 00:13:49,830
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

123
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,381
- Jackie, where the hell were you?
- Kate.

124
00:13:58,506 --> 00:14:00,883
I waited for you. You said you'd come by.

125
00:14:01,634 --> 00:14:03,386
- When?
- You don't remember?

126
00:14:03,511 --> 00:14:06,722
- At my apartment.
- You shouldn't have moved so far away.

127
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:09,684
She moved all the fucking way
uptown. Who can get there?

128
00:14:09,809 --> 00:14:12,979
Oh, right. You get above the 50s,
you get disoriented.

129
00:14:13,104 --> 00:14:15,147
Hello, Kathleen.

130
00:14:16,816 --> 00:14:20,861
- Well.
- It's Terry Noonan. He showed up.

131
00:14:20,987 --> 00:14:25,199
- Look what the cat dragged in.
- How are you?

132
00:14:25,324 --> 00:14:27,618
I thought you were...
Where did we think he was?

133
00:14:27,743 --> 00:14:29,787
Nobody knew.

134
00:14:30,913 --> 00:14:32,873
So, you got nostalgic for mayhem?

135
00:14:32,999 --> 00:14:34,583
Yeah, he just appeared.

136
00:14:34,709 --> 00:14:37,962
It's like angels were flying by,
so they dropped him off.

137
00:14:47,596 --> 00:14:49,765
- What?
- What do you mean, what?

138
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:52,226
You've got this look. What's this look?

139
00:14:52,351 --> 00:14:54,395
Trying to remember how I feel about you.

140
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:57,023
- That hard?
- Yeah, right.

141
00:14:57,148 --> 00:15:01,736
- I think I'm pissed.
- Yeah, you guys were, you know.

142
00:15:01,861 --> 00:15:04,905
Young. Very young.

143
00:15:05,031 --> 00:15:08,492
She cried a lot when you went away.
My poor little sister.

144
00:15:08,617 --> 00:15:11,662
She cried every night, praying
to the rosary you'd come back.

145
00:15:11,787 --> 00:15:14,957
- You broke her heart, Terry.
- You're an asshole, Jackie.

146
00:15:15,082 --> 00:15:17,918
- What did I do?
- I gotta go.

147
00:15:18,043 --> 00:15:19,754
Stay. Have some coffee.

148
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,964
- You just got here.
- I gotta go to work.

149
00:15:22,089 --> 00:15:25,217
Come on. I never see you.
Just for a minute.

150
00:15:25,342 --> 00:15:28,137
- Terry asked about you.
- What did he want to know?

151
00:15:28,262 --> 00:15:31,140
She works up at the Regent Hotel.

152
00:15:31,265 --> 00:15:33,893
Ashtray in the lobby
costs more than my car.

153
00:15:34,018 --> 00:15:37,646
It's a supernatural event for her
to come down here amongst us.

154
00:15:39,273 --> 00:15:41,609
So, what was it I forgot?

155
00:15:41,734 --> 00:15:45,237
You said it would be no trouble
doing that favour I asked you.

156
00:15:45,362 --> 00:15:48,699
My car got hit by a cab.
I used up all my money to pay for it.

157
00:15:48,824 --> 00:15:52,828
- I have nothing to live on till payday.
- I can loan you right now.

158
00:15:52,953 --> 00:15:55,456
She likes our money,
but not the way we get it.

159
00:15:56,081 --> 00:15:58,501
Why don't you keep it?
Keep your money.

160
00:15:59,585 --> 00:16:03,339
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have said that.

161
00:16:03,464 --> 00:16:08,260
Sometimes my feelings get hurt too,
you know? The way you snub us.

162
00:16:08,385 --> 00:16:10,763
Take the money, Kathleen.

163
00:16:10,888 --> 00:16:14,225
- Come on, take it.
- All right. Thank you, Jackie.

164
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:16,685
You're welcome.

165
00:16:20,356 --> 00:16:23,609
So, Terry.

166
00:16:24,693 --> 00:16:28,864
- You just passin' through?
- No. He's coming home.

167
00:16:30,199 --> 00:16:32,785
We're trying to work something out.

168
00:16:33,953 --> 00:16:36,956
If you get above the 40s,
maybe you'll run into me.

169
00:16:38,332 --> 00:16:41,085
It could happen. Right?

170
00:16:41,877 --> 00:16:45,172
<i>- Be up to the angels, I guess.
- Them fucks.</i>

171
00:16:46,048 --> 00:16:50,594
- Well, nice to see you... I guess.
- Same.

172
00:17:01,647 --> 00:17:04,358
My mother-in-law's got
a foot thing I gotta pay for.

173
00:17:04,483 --> 00:17:07,278
- She's got a foot thing.
- She's in the hospital.

174
00:17:07,403 --> 00:17:09,488
It isn't up to me, all right?

175
00:17:11,073 --> 00:17:14,326
Hey, Stevie! I got a surprise for you!

176
00:17:14,451 --> 00:17:16,912
Don't bother me. I'm negotiatin'.

177
00:17:17,037 --> 00:17:20,332
- Hey, negotiator!
- I don't believe this!

178
00:17:20,457 --> 00:17:22,835
Terry fuckin' Noonan!

179
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:25,963
- Where the fuck have you been?
- Fuck, look at you.

180
00:17:26,088 --> 00:17:28,674
Scary Terry. What the fuck is this?

181
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:33,721
- You go to the seminary? You don't write.
- He's bigger than me now.

182
00:17:33,846 --> 00:17:35,681
- It's been a long time.
- Ten years.

183
00:17:35,806 --> 00:17:37,558
- 12 years.
- We're doin' business.

184
00:17:37,683 --> 00:17:41,645
Hey, Stevie. 300 bucks here, Stevie.
It ain't even gonna cut it.

185
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:45,941
- Where'd you find these two idiots?
- They come lookin' for me.

186
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:49,278
They take my money. I work
my ass off for it and they take it.

187
00:17:49,403 --> 00:17:52,406
Listen. This punk owes
Jimmy Cavello eight grand.

188
00:17:52,531 --> 00:17:55,492
Cavello's got cuff links
cost more than that.

189
00:17:55,617 --> 00:17:59,455
Eight grand buys Jimmy
a Broadway ticket. Let's talk business.

190
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,790
They're out of spumone,
you blame the waiter?

191
00:18:01,915 --> 00:18:05,586
What do we have, another mick
to contend with? What's going on?

192
00:18:05,753 --> 00:18:08,547
- You heard what I said.
- Where you fuckin' been?

193
00:18:08,672 --> 00:18:12,092
The last guinea around here was
Columbus. He only lasted a week.

194
00:18:12,217 --> 00:18:15,971
Are you some kind of fuckin' asshole,
or just taking lessons?

195
00:18:18,307 --> 00:18:19,933
Hey, I'll kill you!

196
00:18:34,406 --> 00:18:37,075
You want to fuck with me?
You want to do that?!

197
00:18:37,201 --> 00:18:41,455
What do you want to do, asshole?
Play it out? Let's straighten this out here.

198
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:44,917
Tommy! Tommy, it's over!

199
00:18:45,042 --> 00:18:47,085
It's over, man!

200
00:18:51,507 --> 00:18:55,886
Cocksucker. Who do you think
you're fuckin' with, eh?

201
00:18:56,011 --> 00:18:59,389
You'll be hearing from
Jimmy Cavello, Stevie.

202
00:19:01,975 --> 00:19:06,355
Hope that was your favourite gun.
I hope you loved that gun.

203
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,440
You don't know who you fucked with!

204
00:19:08,565 --> 00:19:10,776
You motherfucker.

205
00:19:11,401 --> 00:19:13,153
Fuck 'em.

206
00:19:13,695 --> 00:19:15,572
- You fuckin' guys.
- You got it all?

207
00:19:15,697 --> 00:19:19,201
You're better than the cavalry.
You saved me from the guineas.

208
00:19:19,326 --> 00:19:24,039
- They was gonna burn you at the stake.
- I'm glad you're back. I missed you.

209
00:19:24,164 --> 00:19:26,750
We'll take this town apart
on St Patty's Day.

210
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:31,755
Stevie, there's a horse runnin'
called Old Friend Arrives.

211
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:34,299
No shit. Look at this.

212
00:19:34,424 --> 00:19:36,677
You saved my ass,
now you'll win me money.

213
00:19:36,802 --> 00:19:39,388
I love ya. I gotta go.
OTB opens in ten minutes.

214
00:19:39,513 --> 00:19:42,724
- Hey, today's my lucky day.
- See ya later.

215
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:45,519
Luckiest day he ever had,
his dog got run over.

216
00:19:45,644 --> 00:19:49,481
- Is he fucked up or is he fucked up?
- I wouldn't let him operate on me.

217
00:19:49,606 --> 00:19:51,817
You'd have to be dead two years first.

218
00:19:55,737 --> 00:19:58,490
I'm gonna call Frankie
about taking you on.

219
00:19:59,575 --> 00:20:02,411
We'll probably have to
go to Jersey to see him.

220
00:20:02,536 --> 00:20:05,372
Jersey? Frankie lives in Jersey?

221
00:20:05,497 --> 00:20:09,251
Yeah. What's the fuckin' world coming to?

222
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:32,357
I want to have kids. I just gotta
find the right broad, like Frankie did.

223
00:20:32,482 --> 00:20:37,154
She'd let me fuck around on weekends,
and make pancakes before Sunday Mass.

224
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:39,448
- Like Irene, maybe.
- Who's Irene?

225
00:20:39,573 --> 00:20:43,452
I spend one night with her, my eyes
are crossed for days. I walk into walls.

226
00:20:43,577 --> 00:20:45,412
- I'd like to meet her.
- She's mine.

227
00:20:45,537 --> 00:20:47,998
- Uncle Jackie!
- Hey.

228
00:20:48,123 --> 00:20:51,251
Hey, hey. Lola, come here.

229
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:53,879
Look what the fuckin' cat dragged in.

230
00:20:54,004 --> 00:20:56,548
Nice to see you, Terry.
You remember Maureen?

231
00:20:56,673 --> 00:21:00,385
- How you doin'?
- Come on inside. We should talk.

232
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:02,637
- I'm Pat.
- How you doin'?

233
00:21:02,763 --> 00:21:06,641
Play with the kids, OK, Jackie?
Teach 'em how to kneel or something.

234
00:21:06,767 --> 00:21:09,102
<i>You want to see my gun, hm?</i>

235
00:21:19,988 --> 00:21:24,284
Before you began exploiting these
pathetic skanks' addictive personalities,

236
00:21:24,409 --> 00:21:27,204
- Where were you?
- A lot of different places.

237
00:21:29,372 --> 00:21:31,416
Tell me about one.

238
00:21:31,917 --> 00:21:34,127
- Texas.
- No shit?

239
00:21:35,796 --> 00:21:39,508
I did my bit with the Corps.
Worked an oiI rig for a while.

240
00:21:39,633 --> 00:21:43,637
Spent a couple of years driving
heavy machinery in Oklahoma.

241
00:21:44,721 --> 00:21:47,265
Even rode a jackhammer in Milwaukee.

242
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:52,813
You picked some very odd fuckin' places.

243
00:21:56,441 --> 00:21:59,277
- No time in the slam, huh?
- No.

244
00:22:00,529 --> 00:22:02,155
You're lucky.

245
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:10,831
I gotta say, when you was a kid,
I never took you for a shooter.

246
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:17,671
You weren't somebody I'd expect to drop
two guys, like I hear you did in the Bronx.

247
00:22:18,463 --> 00:22:20,924
I'll do a good job for you. Take me on.

248
00:22:21,049 --> 00:22:22,926
We'll see.

249
00:22:24,302 --> 00:22:26,346
You wouldn't regret it.

250
00:22:34,396 --> 00:22:37,899
- What do I have to do?
- It's gonna be a hoot, man.

251
00:22:43,238 --> 00:22:45,282
Check him out, Pat.

252
00:22:45,407 --> 00:22:49,119
Find this DeMarco guy
Jackie says is the hit.

253
00:22:49,244 --> 00:22:53,039
If things check out,
relocate DeMarco in a dumpster.

254
00:22:53,164 --> 00:22:58,587
Noonan's with us, I don't want the cops to
look at us for drug bullshit from the Bronx.

255
00:23:25,405 --> 00:23:29,743
This is how me and Frankie deal with
guys tearing apart the neighbourhood.

256
00:23:29,868 --> 00:23:33,496
Easier than sending a telegram.
Don't cost as much.

257
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:41,212
These guys get rich evicting
the real people who live here.

258
00:23:41,338 --> 00:23:43,840
They kick out the Irish
to build yuppie nests.

259
00:23:48,762 --> 00:23:52,140
Yuppies gotta be thicker
than the rats and the roaches.

260
00:23:53,767 --> 00:23:56,519
Assholes can't live without their dogs.

261
00:23:56,644 --> 00:24:00,648
Got dog shit all over the sidewalk.
It never used to be that way.

262
00:24:00,774 --> 00:24:04,652
Used to be, you dropped a cone,
you could pick it up and finish it.

263
00:24:05,695 --> 00:24:09,282
People wander the streets homeless
cos of these assholes.

264
00:24:12,202 --> 00:24:17,165
- So we're like Robin Hood here.
- Yeah. And I'm Friar Fuck.

265
00:24:18,583 --> 00:24:22,170
- What the fuck you doin'?
- 100-yard dash.

266
00:24:22,295 --> 00:24:25,173
- 100-yard dash?
- Yeah.

267
00:24:25,298 --> 00:24:28,426
Are you fuckin' crazy?
You'll blow up the whole place.

268
00:24:31,137 --> 00:24:33,848
I'll only do it if you 
really want to, Terry.

269
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:41,773
All right. All right, you fuckin' asshole.

270
00:24:41,898 --> 00:24:42,941
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

271
00:24:43,316 --> 00:24:44,609
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

272
00:24:44,943 --> 00:24:47,153
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

273
00:24:47,278 --> 00:24:48,655
OK.

274
00:24:49,948 --> 00:24:51,449
One.

275
00:24:54,661 --> 00:24:56,287
Two.

276
00:24:56,412 --> 00:24:57,831
Three!

277
00:25:21,479 --> 00:25:24,732
Neighbourhood, one! Yuppies, zero!

278
00:25:28,278 --> 00:25:30,321
Come on.

279
00:26:18,494 --> 00:26:21,122
Bartender. Guinness.

280
00:26:22,332 --> 00:26:24,459
I want you to meet Irene, man.

281
00:26:26,002 --> 00:26:29,547
- Irene.
- Pleased to meet ya, Terry Noonan.

282
00:26:30,673 --> 00:26:33,718
What you two boys been doin'?
Playing with matches?

283
00:26:33,843 --> 00:26:36,220
- Tell you later, OK?
- You can tell me all night.

284
00:26:36,346 --> 00:26:38,640
It's a long story.

285
00:26:38,765 --> 00:26:40,808
<i>What you gonna do?</i>

286
00:26:42,226 --> 00:26:46,481
<i>- Maybe I'll come back.
- Yeah, the hell you will.</i>

287
00:26:46,606 --> 00:26:48,650
Jackie, what the fuck are you doin'?

288
00:26:48,775 --> 00:26:51,361
- Get the fuck off me!
- Rock 'n' roll!

289
00:26:51,486 --> 00:26:55,031
<i>- Look what you did.
- See you later, Terry.</i>

290
00:27:32,568 --> 00:27:35,780
- Have a good flight.
- Thank you very much.

291
00:27:36,322 --> 00:27:38,032
Hi.

292
00:27:38,783 --> 00:27:40,827
You mind I'm here?

293
00:27:42,036 --> 00:27:44,372
No. No, but it's busy.

294
00:27:45,289 --> 00:27:47,542
What possessed you?

295
00:27:48,793 --> 00:27:52,588
Listen, I have a break in an hour.

296
00:27:52,713 --> 00:27:54,757
- Meet you here?
- Sure.

297
00:27:54,882 --> 00:27:56,717
- Or outside?
- Here's OK.

298
00:27:56,843 --> 00:27:59,804
- Outside's better.
- OK.

299
00:28:02,306 --> 00:28:04,725
I love your uniform.

300
00:28:09,397 --> 00:28:11,941
Is this your dinner break?
You wanna go eat?

301
00:28:12,066 --> 00:28:15,194
Yeah, we could.
I'm not hungry, really.

302
00:28:16,154 --> 00:28:18,322
Frankie's kids are cute.

303
00:28:18,447 --> 00:28:21,367
His wife looks great next to him in court.

304
00:28:21,492 --> 00:28:24,036
They're some Laura Ashley
suburban mutation.

305
00:28:24,162 --> 00:28:26,998
He commutes,
she drives a station wagon.

306
00:28:35,298 --> 00:28:37,341
<i>So what are we doin'?</i>

307
00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:42,346
I wanted to see you.

308
00:28:42,471 --> 00:28:44,473
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

309
00:28:44,599 --> 00:28:47,310
Where's Jackie? Did he stand you up?

310
00:28:47,435 --> 00:28:49,478
He ran into Irene.

311
00:28:50,354 --> 00:28:52,398
What a slut.

312
00:28:54,609 --> 00:28:56,819
So how come you don't have a boyfriend?

313
00:28:56,944 --> 00:29:00,323
I do have a boyfriend. He's out of town.

314
00:29:00,448 --> 00:29:03,117
I met him at the hotel. He travels a lot.

315
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:11,334
I'm lying. I recently broke up.

316
00:29:16,047 --> 00:29:20,176
- I'm divorced.
- Divorced? Really?

317
00:29:21,427 --> 00:29:23,596
Any kids? I hope not.

318
00:29:23,721 --> 00:29:26,223
Six months ago. Yeah, no kids.

319
00:29:32,271 --> 00:29:35,608
- Let's go dancing.
- Don't you want dinner?

320
00:29:35,733 --> 00:29:38,069
- Don't you have to go back?
- I got somebody.

321
00:29:38,194 --> 00:29:42,907
I called the girl who works the other shift.
I begged her. We can do that.

322
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:49,538
<i>You want to go dancing with me?</i>

323
00:29:52,458 --> 00:29:56,712
Come on, Terry. No one forgets
their first love. You know that.

324
00:30:01,592 --> 00:30:03,636
Just the slow ones?

325
00:30:06,097 --> 00:30:07,598
Just the slow ones.

326
00:30:07,723 --> 00:30:11,852
<i>? Well, you tell us that we're wrong</i>

327
00:30:15,147 --> 00:30:19,276
<i>? You tell us not to sing our song</i>

328
00:30:22,905 --> 00:30:27,743
<i>? Nothing we can say will make you see</i>

329
00:30:30,371 --> 00:30:35,876
<i>? You got a heart of stone
you can never feel</i>

330
00:30:37,128 --> 00:30:42,758
<i>? You say: oh, I'm not afraid,
it can't happen to me</i>

331
00:31:12,955 --> 00:31:16,750
- Yeah?
- DeMarco. Buick's out front.

332
00:31:16,876 --> 00:31:19,545
- Point him out.
- You gotta be kidding me, man.

333
00:31:28,929 --> 00:31:32,641
In the corner. At the table.

334
00:31:32,766 --> 00:31:34,810
Just wanted change.

335
00:31:44,862 --> 00:31:48,324
I understand you knew a Terry Noonan.

336
00:31:48,449 --> 00:31:50,659
Get out of my face. I don't know no one.

337
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:54,455
- What's this?
- We're gonna go for a little walk.

338
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:56,624
- What are you, a cop?
- Yeah.

339
00:31:56,749 --> 00:31:58,751
- Let's go.
- I don't know no one.

340
00:31:58,876 --> 00:32:00,336
- Come on.
- I don't!

341
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:10,262
- Yeah?
- Hey, Terry. Terry, it's me, Jackie.

342
00:32:10,387 --> 00:32:12,514
Frankie wants us on the job.

343
00:32:18,145 --> 00:32:20,314
Now? It's two in the morning, man.

344
00:32:21,732 --> 00:32:24,902
This is one of Frankie's peak hours.

345
00:32:59,228 --> 00:33:01,980
- How are you, Mr Raferty?
- I'm fine, Stevie.

346
00:33:06,276 --> 00:33:09,071
I got you five cases of Bushmills.

347
00:33:10,614 --> 00:33:12,991
Nobody drinks it, Flannery.
It costs too much.

348
00:33:13,117 --> 00:33:18,455
I'm selling it cheap. 900 bucks for
all five cases. I'm doing you a favour.

349
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:21,375
Mikey McDonnell ran
the same scam on me for 500.

350
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:25,045
Might be the reason
Mikey didn't leave nothing in his will.

351
00:33:29,049 --> 00:33:32,886
I ain't paying for any
goddamn Bushmills I don't need.

352
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:35,222
Jackie, check out the bar.

353
00:33:35,347 --> 00:33:38,475
- See what this gentleman needs.
- Sure thing, Frank.

354
00:34:10,674 --> 00:34:13,886
Stevie, what are you doing
with these bums?

355
00:34:14,303 --> 00:34:18,307
Stevie, are you gonna let
this dickhead insult us like that?

356
00:34:18,432 --> 00:34:23,520
Looks like they're low. Bar got crowded
tomorrow, it'd go dry in an hour.

357
00:34:28,901 --> 00:34:31,570
Ain't givin' you a fuckin' cent, Flannery.

358
00:34:41,288 --> 00:34:44,291
What are you doing?
It's like beating up your grandfather.

359
00:34:44,416 --> 00:34:46,335
<i>- Shut the fuck up.
- You shut the fuck up.</i>

360
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:49,796
- Don't tell me to shut up.
- Fuck you. You shut the fuck up.

361
00:34:49,922 --> 00:34:53,258
- I won't tell you again! Shut up!
- The man's 50 years old!

362
00:34:53,383 --> 00:34:55,552
- Shut up!
- You shut up!

363
00:34:55,677 --> 00:34:57,262
- Fuck you!
- Stevie, shut up!

364
00:34:57,387 --> 00:34:59,806
- You ain't my fuckin' father!
- Hey, Stevie!

365
00:35:00,974 --> 00:35:04,269
Hey, Pat! Fuck you! Shut up!

366
00:35:04,394 --> 00:35:08,774
- I want your opinion, I'll dial your asshole.
- Nicholson's the asshole.

367
00:35:10,359 --> 00:35:12,486
What the fuck is goin' on here?!

368
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:16,490
- Terry! Get outta here!
- What's the matter, tough guy?

369
00:35:20,494 --> 00:35:22,162
Get outta here!

370
00:35:24,331 --> 00:35:26,041
Get outta here!

371
00:35:27,376 --> 00:35:30,462
Pat, you do what I'm telling you!
Get outta here!

372
00:35:32,047 --> 00:35:35,592
The bunch of you,
get the fuck outta here!

373
00:35:35,717 --> 00:35:37,636
Get outta here!

374
00:35:47,229 --> 00:35:49,481
I want the balance in two days, Raferty,

375
00:35:49,606 --> 00:35:52,901
or you can scratch your name
out of the Yellow Pages.

376
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,864
- What the fuck were you doin'?
- He hit Stevie.

377
00:35:57,990 --> 00:36:01,493
I know he hit him. He was supposed to.
He acted like an asshole.

378
00:36:01,618 --> 00:36:04,079
Why do we have to
beat the shit out of an old man?

379
00:36:04,204 --> 00:36:05,872
To scare him, you clown.

380
00:36:05,998 --> 00:36:08,083
He was scared. He was already scared.

381
00:36:08,208 --> 00:36:10,961
We're trying to intimidate this dickhead.

382
00:36:11,086 --> 00:36:14,715
Then we're in a self-inflicted brawl
acting like a bunch of cowboys.

383
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:17,843
The one thing Borelli don't want!

384
00:36:17,968 --> 00:36:20,721
He'll piss on us if he thinks
we lost our manners.

385
00:36:20,846 --> 00:36:23,056
Frankie, I was fuckin' proud of ya.

386
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:27,394
Acting like yourself for a change,
jumping in there. Not like a greaseball.

387
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:31,648
You check with Borelli before you shit.
I don't know who you are half the time.

388
00:36:31,773 --> 00:36:34,025
- Fuck you.
- I'm sorry if I love you.

389
00:36:34,151 --> 00:36:36,194
- You're my brother.
- You're a curse.

390
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:40,532
- I've taken care of you my whole life.
- You were doin' a good job of it, too.

391
00:36:46,955 --> 00:36:49,458
You fuck me up again,
the whip comes down.

392
00:36:49,583 --> 00:36:51,960
- You got that? You understand me?
- Yeah.

393
00:37:12,898 --> 00:37:15,358
- Who is it?
- Terry.

394
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:30,749
What's the matter?

395
00:37:46,848 --> 00:37:48,892
Terry, what is it?

396
00:39:54,934 --> 00:39:59,981
Now, Frankie, if we're gonna work
together, I got a little problem.

397
00:40:00,106 --> 00:40:01,941
Somehow I got to solve it.

398
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:04,527
Is it something I could
help you with, Mr Borelli?

399
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:07,697
Stevie McGuire.
Lives in your neighbourhood.

400
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:10,533
- You know him?
- Yeah, I know him.

401
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:13,286
It's true. He runs some errands for me.

402
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:16,915
It's also true he owes
Jimmy here eight grand.

403
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:21,044
Now, eight grand's not a lot of money.
I got guys out there owe me 80.

404
00:40:21,169 --> 00:40:24,547
Except I know I'm gonna
get it back from them.

405
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:28,510
It's really not the eight grand
that's got Jimmy and me upset here.

406
00:40:28,635 --> 00:40:32,138
It's this McGuire kid's attitude.

407
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:34,682
Jimmy here goes asking for our money,

408
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:39,729
and this McGuire kid, he spills
a drink on Jimmy's new cashmere.

409
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:41,898
Did it deliberately.

410
00:40:42,023 --> 00:40:44,317
This is what Jimmy tells me.

411
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:46,611
Now Jimmy can't get the stain out.

412
00:40:46,736 --> 00:40:51,324
He's been to six fucking cleaners,
and the best they could do was fade it.

413
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:55,453
This kid just doesn't have
any respect for Jimmy here.

414
00:40:55,578 --> 00:41:00,750
And if he's got no respect for Jimmy,
he's got no respect for me.

415
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:06,589
Frankie, the most important thing
in doing business is good manners.

416
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:09,217
And I really don't think it would be proper

417
00:41:09,342 --> 00:41:13,846
for us to have to go into your
neighbourhood to solve our problem.

418
00:41:13,972 --> 00:41:16,015
Understand?

419
00:41:28,653 --> 00:41:31,990
Frankie, don't make a mess.

420
00:41:34,367 --> 00:41:36,953
You kids from the Westside.

421
00:41:42,417 --> 00:41:45,837
<i>I'm not a connoisseur,
but I know my wine.</i>

422
00:41:45,962 --> 00:41:51,467
I know my way around if I'm at a table.
Not just by the names.

423
00:41:51,592 --> 00:41:54,762
- How you doin', Stevie?
- Hi, Pat.

424
00:41:54,887 --> 00:41:58,141
- We gotta talk.
- Not tonight, Pat, all right?

425
00:41:58,266 --> 00:42:01,436
I'm right in the middle of
telling her my life story.

426
00:42:01,561 --> 00:42:04,772
Yeah, well, it won't take long. I promise.

427
00:42:04,897 --> 00:42:07,650
I gotta step outside. I'll be right back.

428
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:10,737
Cindy, right? Sandy. I'm sorry.

429
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:25,084
What's goin' on, Pat?

430
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:28,671
The eight grand you owe Jimmy Cavello.
Should have quit at two.

431
00:42:28,796 --> 00:42:32,175
Cavello? What have you
got to do with Cavello?

432
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:34,427
How you doin', Stevie?

433
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:37,472
You won't cut me over eight grand
don't even belong to you.

434
00:42:37,597 --> 00:42:39,932
It ain't my habit to cut people up.

435
00:42:42,185 --> 00:42:44,312
I've been working on the eight grand.

436
00:42:44,437 --> 00:42:48,691
I've been chipping away at it. Let me
make a phone call. I'll check on it.

437
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:52,570
You should've made it yesterday,
Stevie. Rent's overdue.

438
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:57,325
Frankie, it's me, all right?

439
00:42:57,450 --> 00:42:59,702
We grew up together. We're friends.

440
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:02,830
Don't give me that bullshit.
My friends don't owe money.

441
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:11,214
You fuck! Fuck you, Frankie,
you motherfucker!

442
00:43:11,339 --> 00:43:15,218
<i>Fuck you. You son of a bitch!</i>

443
00:43:16,511 --> 00:43:19,847
Get the fuck off me!
Get the fuck off me!

444
00:43:19,972 --> 00:43:23,017
- Give me the knife. Got the knife?
- Yeah. Here.

445
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:28,439
You shouldn't have fuckin' said that,
Stevie. I was gonna let Pat do this.

446
00:43:28,564 --> 00:43:32,819
Pat's the expert.
Me, I'm just an amateur.

447
00:43:49,961 --> 00:43:52,213
You did better than
you thought you would.

448
00:43:52,338 --> 00:43:54,632
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

449
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:15,695
<i>Hi. Please
leave a message after the beep.</i>

450
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:20,741
<i>Where the fuck are you?
Terry. Kathleen. Stevie's dead.</i>

451
00:44:20,866 --> 00:44:26,664
<i>- Stevie's fuckin' dead.
- Jack? Jack, where are you?</i>

452
00:44:47,476 --> 00:44:50,187
Aw, look what they fuckin' did!

453
00:44:58,321 --> 00:45:00,197
- Kate.
- Hello, Frankie.

454
00:45:00,323 --> 00:45:03,326
- What are you doin'?
- Frankie! Frank!

455
00:45:03,451 --> 00:45:05,494
You see this, man?!

456
00:45:06,203 --> 00:45:09,165
- You see this?
- What are you doin' here, Kathleen?

457
00:45:09,290 --> 00:45:12,918
Oh, Jesus! They cut his throat, the fucks!

458
00:45:13,044 --> 00:45:16,380
- You shouldn't have brought Kathleen.
- I want to go.

459
00:45:16,505 --> 00:45:19,467
- Kathleen, I'd like to buy you breakfast.
- I gotta go.

460
00:45:19,925 --> 00:45:24,221
Whoever did it, the fucker doesn't
get his cappuccino in the morning.

461
00:45:24,347 --> 00:45:27,016
And I do it. I fuckin' whack him out!

462
00:45:27,141 --> 00:45:30,478
- Don't you jump to conclusions.
- Hey! Hey, Terry!

463
00:45:30,603 --> 00:45:32,188
I'll be right back.

464
00:45:34,857 --> 00:45:38,819
- What did Frankie say?
- Stevie never hurt nobody.

465
00:45:38,944 --> 00:45:42,865
I hurt people. Frankie hurts people.
Stevie borrowed money, that's all.

466
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:45,159
Who'd kill him over fuckin' money?!

467
00:45:45,284 --> 00:45:49,330
You act surprised? Are you serious?
This surprises you?

468
00:45:49,455 --> 00:45:51,749
Every time you turn around
somebody's dead.

469
00:45:51,874 --> 00:45:54,335
- What?
- How many wakes did we go to as kids

470
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:56,712
because somebody forgot to pay money?

471
00:45:56,837 --> 00:46:01,008
Every time we turn around
somebody's dead, huh? Bullshit!

472
00:46:01,133 --> 00:46:03,177
Hey! See?

473
00:46:03,385 --> 00:46:05,888
Hey! See?

474
00:46:08,015 --> 00:46:12,311
Stevie never hurt nobody!
Fuck you!

475
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:15,940
You'll hunt him down. You three
will conduct an investigation

476
00:46:16,065 --> 00:46:18,943
untiI you find somebody
who maybe did this.

477
00:46:19,068 --> 00:46:22,530
I'm glad I saw this. I was forgetting
how you are, how you think.

478
00:46:22,655 --> 00:46:25,950
- It's crazy of me to be near any of you.
- Let me straighten it out.

479
00:46:26,075 --> 00:46:29,203
I shouldn't be seeing you.
Can we stop? Let's just stop.

480
00:46:29,328 --> 00:46:32,289
- Don't do this.
- I'm not gonna get caught... No!

481
00:46:32,414 --> 00:46:36,043
I won't get caught in this any more.
I'm not falling back.

482
00:46:36,168 --> 00:46:38,921
What about me? Huh?

483
00:46:39,046 --> 00:46:41,382
What about me? Hold on.

484
00:46:41,507 --> 00:46:43,008
- Let's go.
- No, hold on!

485
00:46:43,133 --> 00:46:44,635
Here.

486
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:46,428
What about me?

487
00:46:46,554 --> 00:46:50,516
All right, fuck it. I'll call you.
I'll fuckin' call.

488
00:46:57,356 --> 00:47:00,067
- Let's go. I gotta go somewhere.
- Where?

489
00:47:00,568 --> 00:47:04,613
Remember Mickey Cassidy? His sister
didn't wear panties to dance class?

490
00:47:04,738 --> 00:47:07,783
He's dead too. He was
dumb enough to become a cop.

491
00:47:07,908 --> 00:47:10,744
I gotta go to the funeral.
It's over in Queens.

492
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:14,164
- I can't stand driving in Queens.
- You want me to drive?

493
00:47:14,290 --> 00:47:17,668
No. Then I'd have to look out the window.

494
00:47:39,398 --> 00:47:42,443
<i>Ain't gonna be like this when we go.</i>

495
00:47:42,568 --> 00:47:47,114
Probably paste shamrocks on our
foreheads, drop us next to an expressway.

496
00:47:47,239 --> 00:47:50,576
And two years later,
build a fuckin' mall on top of us.

497
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:53,996
People walking all over us
to get a fuckin' milkshake.

498
00:48:23,609 --> 00:48:29,782
I'm feeling squirrelly, man.
All this fuckin' marching music.

499
00:48:30,324 --> 00:48:32,368
I want a drink.

500
00:48:41,418 --> 00:48:43,379
- What do you want?
- Heineken.

501
00:48:43,504 --> 00:48:45,547
Two Heineken.

502
00:48:53,597 --> 00:48:56,141
Cassidy's old man.

503
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:03,107
Better go pay my respects. You coming?

504
00:49:03,232 --> 00:49:05,275
Go ahead.

505
00:49:08,362 --> 00:49:10,405
A couple of Buds.

506
00:49:12,574 --> 00:49:15,786
I'm Jackie Flannery. I knew Mickey.

507
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:22,251
Ain't smart, marching in a parade.
You're supposed to be dead.

508
00:49:22,376 --> 00:49:25,129
If DeMarco were here,
he'd think he was seeing ghosts.

509
00:49:25,254 --> 00:49:27,047
DeMarco is a ghost.

510
00:49:27,172 --> 00:49:30,425
Somebody left him in a dumpster
in his favourite neighbourhood.

511
00:49:31,093 --> 00:49:32,678
Call me.

512
00:49:40,394 --> 00:49:42,437
I gotta get outta here.

513
00:49:44,022 --> 00:49:46,066
I feel like I'm on Mars.

514
00:49:47,651 --> 00:49:49,695
I feel surrounded.

515
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:06,003
- The guineas did Stevie, didn't they?
- Stevie owed everybody.

516
00:50:10,382 --> 00:50:12,593
<i>Hey.</i>

517
00:50:19,766 --> 00:50:22,394
- All right. You ready?
- Yeah.

518
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:39,578
This Stevie McGuire they found floating
in the East River, he's part of this?

519
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:44,082
<i>- Cavello did it.
- Could Flannery have been involved?</i>

520
00:50:46,585 --> 00:50:49,171
He didn't hit one of his own
for no reason.

521
00:50:49,296 --> 00:50:53,383
- Money's always a reason.
- He didn't owe Frankie money.

522
00:50:53,508 --> 00:50:57,054
As a favour, to impress Borelli.
Stevie ain't wrapped in a ribbon,

523
00:50:57,179 --> 00:51:00,849
but Borelli's sense of
self- importance is soothed

524
00:51:00,974 --> 00:51:04,102
that this goofball ain't
walking the streets no more.

525
00:51:05,187 --> 00:51:08,857
You gotta get me outta this.
I'm gonna get caught up in this shit.

526
00:51:08,982 --> 00:51:12,235
- What?
- I don't know what I'm doing here.

527
00:51:12,361 --> 00:51:15,030
- You're a cop.
- These guys are my pals.

528
00:51:15,155 --> 00:51:19,284
You smell like a distillery. You drink
too much. How much are you drinking?

529
00:51:19,451 --> 00:51:24,081
Just listen to me.
Please fuckin' listen to me.

530
00:51:24,206 --> 00:51:27,167
- You gotta get me outta this.
- I gotta get you outta this?

531
00:51:27,292 --> 00:51:30,754
- You're talking like my grandma.
- Fuck!

532
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:38,720
I'm drinking too much. You're right.
Jackie's my friend. My best fuckin' friend.

533
00:51:39,805 --> 00:51:42,933
I thought I could walk in
and do this, but I can't.

534
00:51:43,058 --> 00:51:46,436
- It'll get outta control.
- It's a bullshit attack of feelings.

535
00:51:46,561 --> 00:51:48,605
Just surgically remove the fuckers.

536
00:51:48,730 --> 00:51:51,733
Get on with putting these
scumbags off the street.

537
00:51:51,858 --> 00:51:55,612
You think I went to Boston to be a cop
cos I hated Boston crooks so much?

538
00:51:55,737 --> 00:52:00,826
No, to get away. To get as far away as
I could so that this could never happen.

539
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:05,455
I'd never be in such circumstances
where I'd have to arrest my own friends!

540
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:07,874
These animals are your friends?

541
00:52:07,999 --> 00:52:10,794
Hey, what do you know about it?
I don't know you.

542
00:52:10,919 --> 00:52:13,880
Where are you from?
Poughkeepsie? White Plains?

543
00:52:14,005 --> 00:52:18,093
- Stop drinking, Noonan.
- That's what I'm saying, you fuckin' idiot!

544
00:52:20,637 --> 00:52:24,808
That's all they do is drink.
I'm Irish muscle in these circumstances.

545
00:52:24,933 --> 00:52:27,686
We drink, we shoot people,
and I'll get caught in it.

546
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:30,480
I'm warning you,
I gotta go back to Boston.

547
00:52:30,605 --> 00:52:32,440
You're talking like an asshole.

548
00:52:32,566 --> 00:52:35,610
I'll run the fuck away,
where none of you can find me.

549
00:52:35,735 --> 00:52:38,738
Jesus Christ, I thought you
Kitchen guys were tough guys.

550
00:52:38,864 --> 00:52:41,074
We're not tough, Nick!

551
00:52:43,243 --> 00:52:45,120
- Just crazy.
- You ain't either.

552
00:52:45,245 --> 00:52:47,372
You're a fuckin' crybaby.

553
00:52:58,884 --> 00:53:00,927
Oh, God.

554
00:53:03,138 --> 00:53:05,807
You gotta get something on Flannery.

555
00:53:05,932 --> 00:53:07,976
Hey. Come on.

556
00:53:08,768 --> 00:53:11,146
You gotta get something on Flannery.

557
00:53:11,813 --> 00:53:14,983
You gotta see something
we can accuse him of.

558
00:53:16,109 --> 00:53:21,489
<i>You can get on the witness stand and say
"Him. Fuck him. Put him away. "</i>

559
00:53:23,617 --> 00:53:25,785
It ain't gonna work.

560
00:53:25,911 --> 00:53:30,707
Borelli and Flannery make that deal,
people will drop dead all over the city.

561
00:53:32,375 --> 00:53:34,419
If that happens, Noonan,

562
00:53:36,212 --> 00:53:38,298
the blood's on your hands.

563
00:53:47,182 --> 00:53:51,144
It's a difficult situation.
We're here, they're there in their world.

564
00:53:51,269 --> 00:53:53,855
Looks like Borelli's
gonna let us in. Now this.

565
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:57,108
- How'd you find out?
- People saw him take Stevie to the car.

566
00:53:57,233 --> 00:53:59,653
Cavello was there. They all drove away.

567
00:53:59,778 --> 00:54:02,947
- They think they can do this to us.
- I know that.

568
00:54:03,073 --> 00:54:05,950
They don't respect us.
Cavello's head has gotta roll.

569
00:54:06,076 --> 00:54:10,747
Yes, but first we're gonna show some
maturity. Can you show me maturity?

570
00:54:10,872 --> 00:54:15,251
- I'm talking about the neighbourhood.
- I'm talking about I am your boss.

571
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:21,257
Borelli says nobody gets hit.
We don't have his permission.

572
00:54:23,343 --> 00:54:28,431
The neighbourhood's disappearing
in a tide of yuppies and dog shit.

573
00:54:28,556 --> 00:54:31,559
Borelli's our ticket
so we can retire to Phoenix.

574
00:54:33,353 --> 00:54:38,316
Cavello keeps gettin' up in the morning
till I say different. You got that?

575
00:54:38,441 --> 00:54:41,528
Or you want me to put it
in writing on your forehead?

576
00:54:42,946 --> 00:54:44,447
Jack?

577
00:54:46,991 --> 00:54:48,910
Jack?

578
00:54:49,035 --> 00:54:51,162
You listening to me, Jackie?

579
00:55:07,387 --> 00:55:10,265
<i>- Stop it!
- Terry, Terry, wait. Hold it.</i>

580
00:55:12,392 --> 00:55:15,645
Jackie, stop it!
He wasn't doin' nothing!

581
00:55:15,770 --> 00:55:17,897
Hey, whoa, Jack. Jackie!

582
00:55:18,606 --> 00:55:22,026
You fuckin' maniac! Fuckin' maniac!

583
00:55:25,071 --> 00:55:27,574
<i>You're crazy, you know that?</i>

584
00:55:32,579 --> 00:55:34,330
It's all right. Let him go.

585
00:55:35,874 --> 00:55:38,626
- You OK, huh?
- You all right?

586
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:42,755
Broads, huh?

587
00:55:42,881 --> 00:55:46,885
They put a wire around your dick
and lead you around like Dodo the dog.

588
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:49,220
You gotta marry 'em to forget 'em.

589
00:55:49,345 --> 00:55:51,097
Don't worry about Jackie.

590
00:55:51,222 --> 00:55:55,476
Sit down. Sit down a minute, Terry.
I want to talk to you.

591
00:55:59,647 --> 00:56:01,691
So, you like Kate, huh?

592
00:56:01,816 --> 00:56:03,860
- You've been seeing her.
- Yeah.

593
00:56:06,112 --> 00:56:09,032
You gotta trust me on this one.

594
00:56:09,157 --> 00:56:13,870
It's a crime, but she holds people
like you and me in nothin' but contempt.

595
00:56:13,995 --> 00:56:19,417
You heard of ice queens? My sister Kate
has moved a Frigidaire inside herself.

596
00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:25,256
I'm just tryin' to let you
learn from my experience.

597
00:56:25,381 --> 00:56:28,635
If she thinks I'm shit,
what will she make of you?

598
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:32,430
Don't you think we ought to
be worried about Jackie?

599
00:56:32,555 --> 00:56:35,308
Yeah, you're right. Keep an eye on Jackie.

600
00:56:35,433 --> 00:56:37,560
Keep him out of trouble.

601
00:56:38,603 --> 00:56:40,647
I'm countin' on you, Terry.

602
00:56:45,109 --> 00:56:46,736
Pat.

603
00:56:48,988 --> 00:56:51,783
- Something wrong?
- I don't know.

604
00:56:51,908 --> 00:56:54,953
When you're not too busy,
keep an eye on Noonan for me.

605
00:56:55,078 --> 00:56:57,121
Love to.

606
00:57:15,223 --> 00:57:19,227
- Who is it?
- Kate, it's Terry.

607
00:57:19,352 --> 00:57:22,355
I'm sorry I'm here,
but Jackie's disappeared.

608
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:26,943
I looked everywhere. I can't find him.
You got any idea where he might be?

609
00:57:50,466 --> 00:57:51,676
Jack.

610
00:57:55,096 --> 00:57:58,599
I'd offer you a beer, Kate,
except I drank all of it.

611
00:58:02,019 --> 00:58:04,147
You know...

612
00:58:04,272 --> 00:58:07,775
we'd come here...

613
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:10,153
But not now.

614
00:58:10,278 --> 00:58:13,823
I thought about Stevie
as hard as I could.

615
00:58:16,033 --> 00:58:18,494
I hope that he's praying.

616
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:22,415
I should've known to look for you here.

617
00:58:27,044 --> 00:58:31,257
Do you remember Stevie used to
come here... and hide with us?

618
00:58:32,633 --> 00:58:39,182
Nobody'd ever think we'd come in here
without a nun dragging us in by the ear.

619
00:58:39,307 --> 00:58:41,809
Like Father whatshisface.
Remember him?

620
00:58:41,934 --> 00:58:46,522
He had too much spit, so he foamed
at the mouth when he gave the sermon.

621
00:58:58,784 --> 00:59:00,828
<i>We were kids.</i>

622
00:59:11,214 --> 00:59:13,716
<i>It's peaceful here, right.</i>

623
00:59:19,055 --> 00:59:21,641
Look at all the saints.

624
00:59:22,808 --> 00:59:26,812
There's St Anthony and St Francis.
Who's that one over there?

625
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:30,691
Hey.

626
00:59:35,321 --> 00:59:38,658
Let's go see St Anthony.

627
00:59:38,783 --> 00:59:41,244
Maybe he wants a drink.

628
00:59:59,261 --> 01:00:01,430
<i>Jackie!</i>

629
01:00:03,933 --> 01:00:07,520
I don't think he wants a drink, Jack.

630
01:00:07,645 --> 01:00:09,772
No.

631
01:00:09,897 --> 01:00:12,358
<i>He's a teetotaller.</i>

632
01:00:13,442 --> 01:00:15,778
I'm sorry.

633
01:00:34,088 --> 01:00:37,675
- Jackie.
- Jack, come on.

634
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:40,344
I'm gonna make Stevie a saint.

635
01:00:42,221 --> 01:00:44,765
I'm gonna make Stevie a saint!

636
01:00:47,685 --> 01:00:49,979
I'm gonna make Stevie a saint.

637
01:01:02,992 --> 01:01:08,789
<i>I'm gonna make Stevie a saint.
I'm gonna make Stevie a saint.</i>

638
01:03:07,449 --> 01:03:09,952
- Come on. What...?
- You want some?

639
01:03:10,077 --> 01:03:14,373
No, I don't want some.
Terry, stop it! What are you doin'?!

640
01:03:14,498 --> 01:03:17,710
What are you doin'? Terry, stop it!

641
01:03:22,589 --> 01:03:24,633
What are you doin'?

642
01:03:26,635 --> 01:03:29,388
- Come here.
- I'm a cop!

643
01:03:31,015 --> 01:03:36,270
I'm a cop. I'm a fuckin' Judas cop!

644
01:03:59,918 --> 01:04:02,421
- Terry...
- I gotta go.

645
01:04:09,553 --> 01:04:11,764
- Terry...
- I gotta go.

646
01:04:11,889 --> 01:04:13,932
- What are you sayin'?
- I don't know.

647
01:04:14,057 --> 01:04:16,101
What are you talking about?

648
01:04:19,021 --> 01:04:21,315
What the fuck are you talking about?

649
01:04:42,044 --> 01:04:43,837
Uh-uh.

650
01:04:43,962 --> 01:04:48,050
- What's wrong? Your stomach upset?
- It's hard to get up in the morning.

651
01:04:48,175 --> 01:04:50,302
It's like pulling my socks over my shoes.

652
01:04:50,761 --> 01:04:54,473
- Yeah?
- Like I'm in this fuckin' fog.

653
01:04:56,391 --> 01:04:59,102
Terry, you're missing the point here.

654
01:04:59,228 --> 01:05:01,897
I can't remember shit.
That's the way I like it.

655
01:05:02,022 --> 01:05:04,650
Only hint of a problem is,
I need a little Maalox.

656
01:05:04,775 --> 01:05:07,027
But I can buy Maalox.

657
01:05:09,738 --> 01:05:15,035
- You always were tougher than me.
- I always thought I was just crazier.

658
01:05:35,180 --> 01:05:37,474
You take Finn. He's easy.

659
01:05:38,642 --> 01:05:40,310
What's his marker?

660
01:05:40,435 --> 01:05:43,188
700 and change,
which he ain't gonna have.

661
01:05:43,313 --> 01:05:46,024
Just look him in the eye.
Scare the fuck out of him.

662
01:05:46,149 --> 01:05:49,903
My guy, however, is in the upper bracket.

663
01:05:50,028 --> 01:05:53,907
He got righteous last time.
Refused to open the door.

664
01:06:16,430 --> 01:06:21,059
<i>Hey. I got no money today.</i>

665
01:06:21,184 --> 01:06:23,854
You still gotta open up.

666
01:06:23,979 --> 01:06:28,692
I'm an old man, and I'm eatin'
stewed tomatoes out of a can.

667
01:06:29,568 --> 01:06:33,697
<i>Do you hear my axe? That's my axe.</i>

668
01:06:33,822 --> 01:06:36,366
Don't break that door. I gotta have a door.

669
01:06:36,491 --> 01:06:40,412
- Then open it.
- All right. Wait.

670
01:06:52,924 --> 01:06:57,554
You got anything at all? Five, ten dollars?
They'd think better of you.

671
01:06:57,679 --> 01:07:01,725
You're Terry Noonan.
You're Eddie Noonan's boy.

672
01:07:01,850 --> 01:07:06,146
Oh, my God. I played cards with your dad.

673
01:07:06,271 --> 01:07:09,816
And he showed me pictures
of you all the time.

674
01:07:09,941 --> 01:07:11,985
Lord God.

675
01:07:12,110 --> 01:07:15,947
If he had lived to see that
you was workin' for the Flannerys,

676
01:07:16,073 --> 01:07:17,908
he'd have whipped your ass.

677
01:07:18,033 --> 01:07:20,452
Oh, he was a great man. A great...

678
01:07:20,577 --> 01:07:25,290
When he wasn't drunk or daydreaming
about some bullshit history he never had,

679
01:07:25,415 --> 01:07:29,544
he was beating me or pissing
out the window thinking it was a can.

680
01:07:34,758 --> 01:07:38,637
You want to give a history lesson,
get your facts straight.

681
01:07:39,054 --> 01:07:42,432
I'll tell 'em you're eatin'
stewed tomatoes, OK?

682
01:07:42,557 --> 01:07:45,310
You're cocky, but can I
tell you something?

683
01:07:45,435 --> 01:07:50,398
Them Flannerys are black snakes,
and they move in the dark of the night,

684
01:07:50,524 --> 01:07:54,861
and they always turn on everybody.

685
01:07:54,986 --> 01:07:57,197
I ain't worried.

686
01:07:57,322 --> 01:08:01,535
That McGuire boy, you know,
he wasn't worried neither,

687
01:08:01,660 --> 01:08:05,789
untiI they led him out of
Matty's Bar like a prize pig.

688
01:08:10,126 --> 01:08:13,547
I'm old, but I can still see.

689
01:08:13,672 --> 01:08:15,966
You saw Stevie led out of Matty's Bar?

690
01:08:16,091 --> 01:08:20,846
- Clear as the nose on your face.
- Who led him out?

691
01:08:20,971 --> 01:08:23,306
It's, uh...

692
01:08:23,431 --> 01:08:26,142
- You know, your people.
- It was a Flannery.

693
01:08:26,268 --> 01:08:28,770
Was it Frankie? Huh? Was it Frankie?

694
01:08:28,895 --> 01:08:31,648
If you hit me, you'll fry in hell,
cos your dad...

695
01:08:31,773 --> 01:08:34,943
Who did you see?
Was it Frank? Who'd you see?

696
01:08:35,068 --> 01:08:36,778
I swear I didn't see nothin'.

697
01:08:36,903 --> 01:08:39,072
I saw nothin', I did nothin'. I'm just...

698
01:08:39,197 --> 01:08:42,033
I'm here eating stewed tomatoes
out of a can.

699
01:08:53,545 --> 01:08:57,382
Ain't nobody gonna hit you
for your money. OK?

700
01:09:01,094 --> 01:09:03,138
Oh, God.

701
01:09:11,688 --> 01:09:13,690
How'd it go?

702
01:09:14,316 --> 01:09:17,569
I didn't even knock.
I just took down the door.

703
01:09:17,694 --> 01:09:21,031
It was a beautiful door. A McAndrews.

704
01:09:21,156 --> 01:09:25,910
I caught him off guard by the element
of surprise. Decides he wants to tumble.

705
01:09:26,036 --> 01:09:29,080
So we're throwing punches.
You should have seen it.

706
01:09:29,205 --> 01:09:33,752
We're rolling around on the fuckin'
linoleum. His old lady hollering.

707
01:09:35,211 --> 01:09:37,505
He's a big fuck, so he thinks he's got me.

708
01:09:37,630 --> 01:09:41,259
I think he's got me.
Then I bite into his fuckin' ear.

709
01:09:41,384 --> 01:09:44,763
That stopped the whole thing
in 0.2 seconds.

710
01:09:45,513 --> 01:09:49,893
- So, what are you up for?
- I feel like goin' home.

711
01:09:50,018 --> 01:09:53,646
Yeah? Where's that?

712
01:10:02,238 --> 01:10:04,407
<i>- Call ya later.
- Yeah.</i>

713
01:10:34,813 --> 01:10:37,190
I'm closed.

714
01:10:37,315 --> 01:10:39,734
Who led Stevie McGuire
out of here that night?

715
01:10:39,859 --> 01:10:43,363
- I don't know him.
- You don't know him?

716
01:10:43,488 --> 01:10:45,949
Red-haired guy? Everybody knows Stevie.

717
01:10:46,074 --> 01:10:47,575
I told ya, I don't know him.

718
01:10:47,700 --> 01:10:50,161
<i>- What's he doin'?
- I don't know.</i>

719
01:10:50,286 --> 01:10:54,249
He could be tryin' to find out
about Stevie. He liked that kid.

720
01:10:54,374 --> 01:10:56,709
<i>He could just be havin' a drink.</i>

721
01:10:57,794 --> 01:11:01,339
This fucker's gettin' too complicated.
Let's simplify things.

722
01:11:01,464 --> 01:11:04,634
<i>Take care of the bartender, then
we take a close look at Noonan.</i>

723
01:11:04,759 --> 01:11:06,386
Right.

724
01:11:10,098 --> 01:11:13,309
- Can I use your men's room?
- It's in the back.

725
01:11:19,274 --> 01:11:23,778
Somebody slit my pal's throat
the other night.

726
01:11:24,863 --> 01:11:27,156
- You gonna tell me who that was?
- Big guy.

727
01:11:27,282 --> 01:11:30,076
- What's his name?
- Jesus, don't do this.

728
01:11:30,201 --> 01:11:33,705
Nobody's doin' nothin' to nobody.
It's all just happening, see?

729
01:11:34,330 --> 01:11:38,001
Guy who hangs out with Frankie
Flannery. He walked him out.

730
01:11:45,883 --> 01:11:47,552
- Nicholson.
- I don't know him.

731
01:11:47,677 --> 01:11:49,846
Well, that's his name.

732
01:12:39,187 --> 01:12:41,230
- Ten minutes.
- Fine. Thank you.

733
01:13:01,459 --> 01:13:04,003
- Hi, Kathleen.
- Frankie, what are you doing?

734
01:13:04,128 --> 01:13:06,589
I gotta talk to you.
Can you find me a minute?

735
01:13:06,714 --> 01:13:08,883
Yeah. Give me five minutes.

736
01:13:09,008 --> 01:13:12,387
Tell you what. Meet you in the bar
over there. Straight ahead.

737
01:13:12,512 --> 01:13:15,807
- Where's the bar?
- Right through there and to your right.

738
01:13:15,932 --> 01:13:17,975
- Don't keep me waiting.
- I won't.

739
01:13:33,074 --> 01:13:35,118
Sit down.

740
01:13:40,581 --> 01:13:42,625
I ordered you a white wine.

741
01:13:46,587 --> 01:13:48,214
What is it you want, Frankie?

742
01:13:48,339 --> 01:13:51,092
I don't gotta want something
all the time, do I?

743
01:13:51,217 --> 01:13:53,302
I never knew you when you didn't.

744
01:13:54,887 --> 01:13:56,806
Who took care of you
when you was a kid?

745
01:13:56,931 --> 01:14:02,061
When guys hit on you, who took care
of you? Who went looking for them?

746
01:14:02,186 --> 01:14:06,399
That's why I moved up here-so nice men
could hit on me and not fear for their life.

747
01:14:06,524 --> 01:14:09,152
They fly to Europe.
That don't make 'em nice.

748
01:14:12,363 --> 01:14:14,991
I don't know what happened between us.

749
01:14:15,867 --> 01:14:19,495
It's kind of like you never
even wanted to know me.

750
01:14:19,620 --> 01:14:23,958
If you feel rejected, Frankie,
it's because I do. I reject you.

751
01:14:25,126 --> 01:14:27,169
You're so cold.

752
01:14:29,672 --> 01:14:31,382
What happened to you?

753
01:14:31,507 --> 01:14:37,221
What happened to that sweet little girl,
her heart was shining through her skin?

754
01:14:37,346 --> 01:14:42,268
People say that when they can't make you
do what they want - "You're so cold. "

755
01:14:42,393 --> 01:14:45,605
The way you treat me,
I ought to box your ears.

756
01:14:45,730 --> 01:14:47,857
- I have to go back to work.
- Sit down.

757
01:14:47,982 --> 01:14:52,361
Sit down for a minute.
I want to talk to you.

758
01:14:52,486 --> 01:14:54,947
I want to talk to you
about Terry Noonan.

759
01:14:55,072 --> 01:14:59,702
He's coming to work for me in my
organisation. I think he'll do very well.

760
01:15:00,828 --> 01:15:05,249
But, in the Bronx two weeks ago, you'd
be so surprised to know what he did.

761
01:15:05,374 --> 01:15:08,544
He got tangled up in this drug deal
with these lowlifes.

762
01:15:08,669 --> 01:15:12,256
He killed both of 'em.
He shot 'em point-blank.

763
01:15:13,132 --> 01:15:16,427
So he ain't what
you're looking for, is he, Kate?

764
01:15:23,726 --> 01:15:26,395
You came all the way
across town to tell me that?

765
01:15:26,520 --> 01:15:29,732
I thought that you should know it,
that's all.

766
01:16:01,263 --> 01:16:04,433
- Yeah?
- It's Kathleen.

767
01:16:08,854 --> 01:16:10,439
I have to talk to you.

768
01:16:10,564 --> 01:16:13,359
You should've called.
These halls are dangerous.

769
01:16:13,484 --> 01:16:18,322
It was hopeless. I had to see you.
My mind set its own agenda. So here I am.

770
01:16:18,447 --> 01:16:23,035
- What time is it?
- It was three when I left the house.

771
01:16:23,160 --> 01:16:26,747
- You want a drink?
- I've had two Valium already.

772
01:16:26,872 --> 01:16:31,585
My mind's just... spinning
with everything, you know?

773
01:16:31,710 --> 01:16:33,212
Sit down.

774
01:16:35,965 --> 01:16:38,759
I mean... Frankie told me
you're working for him.

775
01:16:38,884 --> 01:16:41,053
- Why'd he do that?
- What do you mean, why?!

776
01:16:41,178 --> 01:16:43,973
Because I got away!

777
01:16:44,098 --> 01:16:47,893
You tell me you're a cop and he tells me
you killed two drug dealers in the Bronx.

778
01:16:48,018 --> 01:16:50,855
No, that was a setup. They were cops.

779
01:16:50,980 --> 01:16:53,649
- You killed two cops?
- It wasn't real. I had blanks.

780
01:16:53,774 --> 01:16:56,026
They went down, gave me credentials...

781
01:16:56,152 --> 01:16:59,196
- I don't know about this.
- You're asking me.

782
01:16:59,321 --> 01:17:01,574
- I thought you were different.
- I am. I'm a cop!

783
01:17:01,699 --> 01:17:04,451
They're my brothers
and you're gonna put 'em in jaiI!

784
01:17:04,577 --> 01:17:08,414
- You're jumping all over the place.
- I'm not jumping all over the place.

785
01:17:09,415 --> 01:17:13,669
My brother comes to me and he...
he's telling me he trusts you,

786
01:17:13,794 --> 01:17:16,881
and I have this knowledge that you're a...

787
01:17:17,339 --> 01:17:19,925
- When I told Linda everything...
- Who's Linda?

788
01:17:20,759 --> 01:17:23,220
My shrink. I had a double session today.

789
01:17:23,345 --> 01:17:27,057
You told your shrink?
You told your shrink about me?

790
01:17:27,183 --> 01:17:29,143
- Of course I told her!
- Wait a minute.

791
01:17:29,268 --> 01:17:32,313
There's some shrink out there
who knows I'm a cop?

792
01:17:32,438 --> 01:17:34,982
- That's right. I have a shrink.
- Fuck me!

793
01:17:35,107 --> 01:17:39,987
I tell her what happens in my life. I have
a right to try and straighten out my life!

794
01:17:40,112 --> 01:17:43,032
- You could get me killed!
- Oh, shit.

795
01:17:44,074 --> 01:17:46,702
I thought I was out of this.

796
01:17:46,827 --> 01:17:49,622
I thought I'd gotten away.
It's like some trick.

797
01:17:49,747 --> 01:17:52,791
I don't know how I ended up here
but you gotta help me.

798
01:17:52,917 --> 01:17:54,585
I can't leave town. I have a job.

799
01:17:54,710 --> 01:17:59,298
And I can't move any further uptown...
or I'll be in fucking Harlem!

800
01:17:59,423 --> 01:18:02,760
That's what I came here to tell you.
Just stay away from me.

801
01:18:02,885 --> 01:18:05,804
- That's not why you're here.
- Yeah, it is.

802
01:18:05,930 --> 01:18:07,765
- No.
- Yes, it is.

803
01:18:07,890 --> 01:18:12,394
People don't come to a place like this
in the night to tell someone to stay away.

804
01:18:12,519 --> 01:18:15,022
- Terry, don't.
- Kathleen, it's OK.

805
01:18:15,147 --> 01:18:17,608
- Don't.
- It's OK.

806
01:18:18,901 --> 01:18:20,945
It's OK.

807
01:18:36,585 --> 01:18:40,130
No. Get off of me. Get off of me!

808
01:18:40,255 --> 01:18:44,134
I don't want anything to do with you!
Stay away from me!

809
01:18:44,259 --> 01:18:47,346
You're just like my fuckin' brothers!
You are!

810
01:18:47,471 --> 01:18:50,349
You think you can come to me
whenever you fuckin' want,

811
01:18:50,474 --> 01:18:53,977
and you just reach inside me
and you just... you just pull!

812
01:18:54,103 --> 01:18:56,105
- You can't!
- I love you.

813
01:18:56,230 --> 01:19:00,693
You're a liar. I've met you before.
You're a fuckin' liar! You shut up!

814
01:19:22,464 --> 01:19:26,927
You ask these fucks for a cappuccino
or a cannoli, their eyes cross.

815
01:19:27,970 --> 01:19:31,765
Corned beef and cabbage.
Give us a green pitcher of beer.

816
01:19:37,438 --> 01:19:39,481
Give me a pitcher.

817
01:19:41,692 --> 01:19:44,528
- These fucks come here often?
- I don't know.

818
01:19:48,907 --> 01:19:52,077
How many times I gotta tell you?
That's Frankie.

819
01:19:52,202 --> 01:19:54,997
I'm trying to tell you something.
This is Jackie.

820
01:19:55,122 --> 01:19:58,167
I see this kid all the time
on Tenth Avenue. It's Frankie.

821
01:19:58,292 --> 01:20:00,752
I'll go down. I'll settle it. 
I'll talk to him.

822
01:20:00,878 --> 01:20:03,839
Yeah, ask him to come over here
and have a drink.

823
01:20:11,221 --> 01:20:14,099
We're arguing whether
you're a Flannery or not.

824
01:20:14,224 --> 01:20:18,770
You are, right? You're not Frankie,
you're the other one, right?

825
01:20:18,896 --> 01:20:21,273
No, I'm not Frankie.

826
01:20:21,398 --> 01:20:23,442
You see that guy over there?

827
01:20:24,067 --> 01:20:26,195
That's Jimmy Cavello.

828
01:20:26,320 --> 01:20:28,614
Jimmy says let bygones be bygones.

829
01:20:28,739 --> 01:20:31,700
He wants you to come over
and join us for a drink.

830
01:20:33,410 --> 01:20:35,495
Get him a pitcher of anything he wants.

831
01:20:35,621 --> 01:20:39,124
Come on, join us. You hungry?
You want something to eat?

832
01:20:39,249 --> 01:20:40,834
No.

833
01:20:47,299 --> 01:20:49,343
Pull up a chair, kid.

834
01:21:08,862 --> 01:21:09,988
Fuck it.

835
01:21:50,612 --> 01:21:52,989
- Everybody get the fuck out.
- What's up?

836
01:21:53,115 --> 01:21:55,158
Get out!

837
01:21:56,576 --> 01:21:58,787
You're a piece of work, Jackie.

838
01:21:58,912 --> 01:22:03,083
- They come into our neighbourhood...
- Who am I? Who the fuck am I?!

839
01:22:03,208 --> 01:22:07,462
I am your boss! But you hurt me.
You try to help me, you fuckin' hurt me!

840
01:22:07,587 --> 01:22:10,716
He whacks out Stevie
and thinks I would drink with him.

841
01:22:10,841 --> 01:22:14,094
We're talking about discipline,
maturity. This is what I get?!

842
01:22:14,219 --> 01:22:19,725
- He shouldn't have sent his goon to me.
- Tell me one thing! Am I a joke to you?

843
01:22:19,850 --> 01:22:21,768
Is that how you see me?

844
01:22:21,893 --> 01:22:26,898
I don't want this shithead sittin' in
our neighbourhood like the fuckin' pope!

845
01:22:27,774 --> 01:22:30,318
- You know what you did?
- Paid Stevie back.

846
01:22:30,444 --> 01:22:32,696
No, you maybe started a fuckin' war.

847
01:22:32,821 --> 01:22:37,325
Two steps away from a deal and money
like the lottery, you fuck it up. For what?

848
01:22:37,451 --> 01:22:41,955
Stevie! A jerk-off kid who insults
the world by not paying what he owes.

849
01:22:42,080 --> 01:22:45,250
- Frankie!
- Can't you see I'm busy here?!

850
01:22:45,375 --> 01:22:51,256
- Want me to rip the phone off the wall?
- It's Borelli. Somebody for Borelli.

851
01:22:51,381 --> 01:22:54,134
- What's he want?
- Shut up.

852
01:22:57,637 --> 01:23:00,265
Yeah. Yeah.

853
01:23:07,189 --> 01:23:08,607
Yeah.

854
01:23:09,941 --> 01:23:11,693
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

855
01:23:14,613 --> 01:23:17,657
He wants a sit-down. Me and him.

856
01:23:19,701 --> 01:23:21,453
When?

857
01:23:22,454 --> 01:23:24,956
- Get me a pot of coffee.
- How many cups?

858
01:23:25,081 --> 01:23:26,833
One.

859
01:23:32,214 --> 01:23:34,382
You send everybody home.

860
01:23:34,507 --> 01:23:37,135
But they are by their phones.

861
01:23:37,260 --> 01:23:40,055
They don't leave their phones
to go to the can

862
01:23:40,180 --> 01:23:42,474
they can't hear the phone ringing.

863
01:23:46,561 --> 01:23:49,898
I want you outside the door.
See that I am not disturbed.

864
01:23:50,023 --> 01:23:51,441
Right.

865
01:24:01,159 --> 01:24:04,955
- What about me?
- You go home.

866
01:24:05,080 --> 01:24:07,832
You sit by the phone.

867
01:24:07,958 --> 01:24:10,001
Can you do that?

868
01:24:12,003 --> 01:24:15,173
- What are you gonna do?
- I got some thinkin' to do.

869
01:24:15,298 --> 01:24:17,550
I gotta figure this thing out.

870
01:24:18,885 --> 01:24:21,680
I gotta have some privacy
to sit and think

871
01:24:21,805 --> 01:24:24,557
and figure how I'm gonna
handle this thing.

872
01:24:59,551 --> 01:25:03,221
<i>- Yeah?
- Hey, Terry. It's me, Jackie.</i>

873
01:25:03,346 --> 01:25:06,057
<i>- Yeah, Jackie.
- Got a little job.</i>

874
01:25:06,182 --> 01:25:11,938
<i>Meet me at 43rd and Broadway.
About 11 o'clock, all right?</i>

875
01:25:12,063 --> 01:25:14,190
<i>- Can you get there?
- I'll be there.</i>

876
01:25:14,315 --> 01:25:16,359
<i>All right. See ya.</i>

877
01:25:44,053 --> 01:25:47,557
<i>Hi. Please
leave a message after the beep.</i>

878
01:25:47,682 --> 01:25:49,851
<i>Hey, it's me. You there?</i>

879
01:25:49,976 --> 01:25:52,562
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

880
01:25:57,859 --> 01:26:00,195
<i>Will you pick up if you're there?</i>

881
01:26:02,447 --> 01:26:05,700
<i>Look, we're in the middle of this thing.
You gotta understand.</i>

882
01:26:05,825 --> 01:26:09,621
<i>And I'm sorry. If I hurt you,
I'm sorry, all right?</i>

883
01:26:10,330 --> 01:26:12,749
<i>I'll get back. Good night.</i>

884
01:26:34,270 --> 01:26:35,813
Hey, Terry.

885
01:26:43,238 --> 01:26:45,698
Where are we going? Beirut?

886
01:26:45,823 --> 01:26:49,869
Borelli's phoned Frankie.
We gotta come to this meeting.

887
01:26:49,994 --> 01:26:53,873
Cavello got wasted in the Kitchen
in the wee hours of the morning.

888
01:26:53,998 --> 01:26:56,584
- Cavello?
- Yeah.

889
01:26:56,709 --> 01:26:59,003
Is nobody safe?

890
01:27:10,265 --> 01:27:12,850
- You got the address?
- Yeah, right here.

891
01:27:12,976 --> 01:27:15,270
Get on down there now, OK? Get situated.

892
01:27:15,395 --> 01:27:18,648
It's just up from the restaurant.
Everything arranged.

893
01:27:18,773 --> 01:27:22,819
I arrive at noon. I don't call you
by two o'clock or Pat don't call you,

894
01:27:22,944 --> 01:27:27,115
you come in, tear 'em apart,
the spaghetti still on their spoons.

895
01:27:29,284 --> 01:27:31,953
You OK, Noonan?
Everything OK with you?

896
01:27:32,078 --> 01:27:36,374
- It'll be all right, Frankie.
- Yeah, either we're dead or we ain't.

897
01:27:43,172 --> 01:27:45,925
Anybody know how to get to Mott Street?

898
01:27:47,218 --> 01:27:48,636
Damn.

899
01:28:33,181 --> 01:28:34,849
Terry.

900
01:29:16,390 --> 01:29:20,144
...fold like a futon,
and the fuckin' frame's bent, right?

901
01:29:20,269 --> 01:29:24,607
So I bring it home. It looks easy.
I can't put the fuckin' thing together.

902
01:29:24,732 --> 01:29:28,819
So we called in a neighbour,
a guy with a very nice fuckin'...

903
01:29:29,529 --> 01:29:31,572
Let's get down to business.

904
01:29:31,697 --> 01:29:36,577
<i>First of all, this problem we got here.
This is your responsibility.</i>

905
01:29:37,036 --> 01:29:40,706
Either you get the respect
of your own people, or you got nothin'.

906
01:29:41,290 --> 01:29:45,920
My people, I let them go
at this thing on their own,

907
01:29:46,045 --> 01:29:49,715
your brother, he'd be in so many
fuckin' pieces right now,

908
01:29:49,840 --> 01:29:53,844
you couldn't put him back together
again even if you had directions.

909
01:29:54,470 --> 01:29:56,514
But I said no.

910
01:29:56,639 --> 01:30:00,643
I said Frankie Flannery is a man who
knows when things have to be set right,

911
01:30:00,768 --> 01:30:05,606
and that you'd never let your feelings
get in the way of a big business decision.

912
01:30:05,731 --> 01:30:09,527
Now, what I told my people,
Frankie... was wrong?

913
01:30:23,541 --> 01:30:26,544
Of course, this is
a matter of some complexity.

914
01:30:26,669 --> 01:30:32,091
But if you won't solve this problem,
I'm gonna have it solved for you.

915
01:30:32,216 --> 01:30:36,762
You understand that? Huh?

916
01:30:40,725 --> 01:30:43,519
You don't have to
worry about Frankie, man.

917
01:30:43,644 --> 01:30:47,231
And if he ain't OK, there'll be
a dumpster full of dead guineas,

918
01:30:47,356 --> 01:30:49,400
spaghetti still on their forks.

919
01:31:05,791 --> 01:31:08,044
Look...

920
01:31:08,169 --> 01:31:10,212
I could straighten the kid out.

921
01:31:11,756 --> 01:31:15,176
Jimmy Cavello was a great guy.
We all know this.

922
01:31:16,677 --> 01:31:18,721
But the kid...

923
01:31:21,140 --> 01:31:23,184
The kid...

924
01:31:24,351 --> 01:31:27,396
You should've been there
when I reamed him out over this.

925
01:31:27,521 --> 01:31:30,691
He'd have crawled in a hole
and brought the hole in with him,

926
01:31:30,816 --> 01:31:32,526
if he could find a hole to go into.

927
01:31:32,651 --> 01:31:37,782
Don't embarrass yourself, Frankie.
I know you don't want to insult me.

928
01:31:37,907 --> 01:31:39,116
No.

929
01:31:39,241 --> 01:31:43,245
But to be frivolous on a matter
of such importance is an insult.

930
01:31:44,080 --> 01:31:46,415
This fuckin' bum is your brother.

931
01:31:46,540 --> 01:31:50,961
So I understand your need to pursue
some hopeless course to try to save him.

932
01:31:51,504 --> 01:31:55,716
But everybody knows
what's gotta happen here.

933
01:31:55,841 --> 01:32:01,096
With every heartbeat, his miserable
fuckin' douche-bag life insults me.

934
01:32:04,266 --> 01:32:07,311
He's a thorn in my side, Frankie.

935
01:32:08,062 --> 01:32:11,649
<i>Since we're together,
he's a thorn in your side.</i>

936
01:32:13,776 --> 01:32:15,986
Now look, Frankie.

937
01:32:16,111 --> 01:32:19,824
I gotta know, and I gotta know now.

938
01:32:22,451 --> 01:32:26,747
Are you gonna be able to
pull this thorn out of our side?

939
01:32:35,714 --> 01:32:37,675
All right.

940
01:32:37,800 --> 01:32:39,844
This is your brother, Frank.

941
01:32:40,928 --> 01:32:47,643
<i>So, for the sake of family and blood,
I'm gonna give you this opportunity.</i>

942
01:33:27,099 --> 01:33:30,811
Looks like it's time
to kick some guinea ass.

943
01:33:31,604 --> 01:33:33,939
But he didn't call yet, Jackie.

944
01:33:34,064 --> 01:33:37,818
He said we don't go
untiI he called or Pat called.

945
01:33:37,943 --> 01:33:41,947
- That ain't what he said.
- Course it was. I was right there.

946
01:33:42,072 --> 01:33:45,326
- Richie, what'd he say?
- Who?

947
01:33:45,451 --> 01:33:47,202
- Frankie!
- About what?

948
01:33:47,328 --> 01:33:50,831
What are you askin' him for?
He's fuckin' stupid.

949
01:33:56,211 --> 01:33:59,006
Now, let's have some dessert.

950
01:34:02,176 --> 01:34:05,846
- I gotta make a call.
- Let the business wait.

951
01:34:05,971 --> 01:34:08,390
- Enjoy your dessert.
- It's my wife.

952
01:34:08,515 --> 01:34:10,601
Don't offend me, Frankie.

953
01:34:10,726 --> 01:34:14,188
You're gonna get up from my table
to call your wife?

954
01:34:15,397 --> 01:34:17,441
Let her wait.

955
01:34:21,028 --> 01:34:22,821
Don't fuck him up again.

956
01:34:22,946 --> 01:34:25,324
- That ain't what he said.
- It is what he said.

957
01:34:25,449 --> 01:34:28,827
<i>- He said if he didn't call.
- No, if he did call.</i>

958
01:34:28,952 --> 01:34:32,122
If we said... He said if we didn't call.

959
01:34:32,247 --> 01:34:33,749
- If he did.
- If he didn't.

960
01:34:33,874 --> 01:34:35,667
Did. Jack...

961
01:34:35,793 --> 01:34:38,462
I was in the truck.
He said if he didn't call.

962
01:34:38,587 --> 01:34:40,631
- No.
- If we didn't fuckin' call.

963
01:34:40,756 --> 01:34:44,093
- Where was I?!
- You were there too! You're fuckin' deaf!

964
01:34:44,218 --> 01:34:46,804
- He said if he didn't call.
- He said if he did call.

965
01:34:46,929 --> 01:34:48,806
- Relax.
- Richie.

966
01:34:49,890 --> 01:34:52,726
- I didn't hear him.
- He's fuckin' retarded!

967
01:34:52,851 --> 01:34:55,229
Nothing personal, Richard. You're stupid.

968
01:34:55,354 --> 01:34:57,481
That's not what he said.

969
01:34:59,608 --> 01:35:02,528
Jack, he said if he did call.

970
01:35:02,653 --> 01:35:04,863
If he called, we go. Otherwise no.

971
01:35:07,908 --> 01:35:09,952
Have a piece of cheesecake.

972
01:35:20,546 --> 01:35:22,923
Fuck me, man. This don't feel right.

973
01:35:23,841 --> 01:35:26,844
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

974
01:35:33,016 --> 01:35:35,060
Jack, calm down.

975
01:35:38,897 --> 01:35:42,526
<i>- Whoo!
- Jackie, Jackie, Jackie. Listen.</i>

976
01:35:42,651 --> 01:35:45,362
He said if he did call...
Relax. Will you relax?

977
01:35:45,487 --> 01:35:49,449
- Terry, I love you, but you're wrong.
- I love you too, and I'm right.

978
01:35:49,575 --> 01:35:51,743
- He could be dying. Let's go.
- Jack...

979
01:35:51,869 --> 01:35:53,912
Let's go, huh?!

980
01:35:54,913 --> 01:35:58,125
You want me to make that call
for you, Mr Flannery?

981
01:35:58,250 --> 01:36:00,586
Tell your boy to stop
movin' around so much.

982
01:36:02,254 --> 01:36:05,215
He's interfering with my digestion.

983
01:36:10,387 --> 01:36:13,557
Have a cannoli. Some anisette.

984
01:36:17,185 --> 01:36:19,313
Just fucking go!

985
01:36:27,404 --> 01:36:29,698
<i>Let's go. Come on.</i>

986
01:36:31,116 --> 01:36:33,910
I'm coming. I'm ready. All right.

987
01:36:38,957 --> 01:36:41,001
- You want your clock?
- No.

988
01:36:42,669 --> 01:36:44,921
Big mistake. Big mistake.

989
01:36:53,430 --> 01:36:56,475
Mr Borelli, I really do
gotta make a phone call.

990
01:36:56,600 --> 01:36:59,686
I must make it.
My wife's not been feeling well.

991
01:37:04,149 --> 01:37:06,151
With your permission.

992
01:37:08,028 --> 01:37:10,364
Go. Make your call.

993
01:37:10,489 --> 01:37:12,074
Thank you.

994
01:38:01,665 --> 01:38:03,834
See? She ain't even home.

995
01:38:17,722 --> 01:38:21,434
Either they forgot about us or
this entire neighbourhood better duck.

996
01:38:40,662 --> 01:38:44,875
All right. I want you to
drop me off at 39th Street.

997
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:47,127
He ain't there! Frankie ain't there!

998
01:38:57,053 --> 01:39:00,181
Frank! It ain't a hit! It ain't a hit!

999
01:39:02,017 --> 01:39:04,895
- Let's get out of here!
- Move it!

1000
01:39:06,688 --> 01:39:09,399
- It's all right.
- He was talking to him.

1001
01:39:09,524 --> 01:39:11,026
I know. Turn around.

1002
01:39:11,359 --> 01:39:13,570
What's this?

1003
01:39:13,695 --> 01:39:17,198
Frankie, I hope you're not
lookin' to start a war here.

1004
01:39:17,324 --> 01:39:19,326
In a war, we would crush you.

1005
01:39:19,451 --> 01:39:21,494
You understand?

1006
01:39:25,290 --> 01:39:28,418
Hey. Dumb fucks.
Don't know how close they came.

1007
01:39:28,877 --> 01:39:31,379
It's your brother.

1008
01:39:31,504 --> 01:39:33,673
My heart goes out to you.

1009
01:39:48,980 --> 01:39:53,860
<i>What happened, apparently,
is that Borelli's got this beef with Cavello.</i>

1010
01:39:53,985 --> 01:39:57,781
Cavello failed to get permission
from Borelli to take out Stevie,

1011
01:39:57,906 --> 01:40:00,700
which pissed Borelli off
cos of this thing with us.

1012
01:40:00,825 --> 01:40:04,829
And there was probably some
other secretive guinea bullshit too.

1013
01:40:04,954 --> 01:40:08,416
So... he don't give a shit about Cavello.

1014
01:40:08,541 --> 01:40:10,794
No.

1015
01:40:10,919 --> 01:40:14,631
And as a kind of bonus
he's sendin' over 25 grand.

1016
01:40:14,756 --> 01:40:18,760
All we gotta do is drop a couple of
Haitians who are on his drug turf.

1017
01:40:18,885 --> 01:40:21,721
He's sendin' over
the first instalment tonight.

1018
01:40:21,846 --> 01:40:24,474
- You wanna pick it up?
- Sure.

1019
01:40:25,600 --> 01:40:27,352
Good.

1020
01:40:29,187 --> 01:40:31,231
It's unbelievable, huh?

1021
01:40:32,273 --> 01:40:34,317
The way things turn out.

1022
01:40:37,278 --> 01:40:38,738
Yeah.

1023
01:40:42,409 --> 01:40:47,872
I gotta catch a shower, and some fresh
clothes. I've been in this shit for days.

1024
01:40:47,997 --> 01:40:51,918
The pick-up's at 11.
I'll let you know where.

1025
01:40:52,043 --> 01:40:56,214
I want to keep this hush-hush, OK?
Just you and me. It's a lot of money.

1026
01:40:56,339 --> 01:41:01,344
St Patty's is coming up, so we'll have
a little loose change to celebrate with.

1027
01:41:03,179 --> 01:41:05,515
Hey, Jack.

1028
01:41:08,518 --> 01:41:10,437
Come here.

1029
01:41:23,116 --> 01:41:26,411
- You ain't done that for years.
- Yeah.

1030
01:41:51,769 --> 01:41:53,938
- Hey.
- Hey.

1031
01:41:56,566 --> 01:41:58,985
I missed you at the club. What's goin' on?

1032
01:42:00,612 --> 01:42:03,740
Gotta work untiI 11 or so.

1033
01:42:03,865 --> 01:42:06,284
We can hoot and holler after that.

1034
01:42:06,409 --> 01:42:09,954
Like, I can meet you at the club about 12.

1035
01:42:12,373 --> 01:42:14,834
- Want a beer?
- Sure.

1036
01:42:19,547 --> 01:42:23,801
- You OK?
- I'm feeling fucked up.

1037
01:42:23,927 --> 01:42:26,721
I gotta make a pick-up.

1038
01:42:26,846 --> 01:42:32,977
25 grand. Borelli's got some
bullshit Haitian problems.

1039
01:42:35,563 --> 01:42:37,607
Pick-up's at Battery Park.

1040
01:42:43,404 --> 01:42:45,865
I'm fuckin' beat, man.

1041
01:42:45,990 --> 01:42:48,826
I'm gonna ask Frankie
for a little time off.

1042
01:42:48,952 --> 01:42:50,995
I've been working hard.

1043
01:42:53,915 --> 01:42:57,543
So, the parade's coming up.

1044
01:42:58,127 --> 01:43:00,088
Wouldn't that be nice?

1045
01:43:00,213 --> 01:43:05,677
You, me and Kate can go celebrate
St Patty's Day together.

1046
01:43:07,637 --> 01:43:10,348
Go see the parade. Wanna?

1047
01:43:10,473 --> 01:43:13,810
Listen, Jackie. I heard something.

1048
01:43:18,439 --> 01:43:22,777
- I hear Frankie put the hit on Stevie.
- What?

1049
01:43:22,902 --> 01:43:25,279
Hey, hey, hey! Get out!

1050
01:43:25,405 --> 01:43:29,117
That is my fuckin' brother
you're talking about, huh?!

1051
01:43:29,242 --> 01:43:31,285
- I heard it.
- Yeah, you heard it!

1052
01:43:31,411 --> 01:43:36,708
Don't mean you gotta repeat it!
You repeat everything you hear?!

1053
01:43:36,833 --> 01:43:39,335
I'm sorry. I heard it.

1054
01:43:47,260 --> 01:43:51,514
- I oughta shoot your fuckin' eyes out.
- I thought you should know.

1055
01:44:09,031 --> 01:44:11,325
Get out. Get outta here!

1056
01:44:11,701 --> 01:44:13,744
Come on!

1057
01:44:15,246 --> 01:44:17,540
I should wash your mouth out with soap.

1058
01:44:17,665 --> 01:44:21,669
You go somewhere and you think
about what you're saying. Yeah?

1059
01:44:38,519 --> 01:44:41,606
- Battery Park at 11.
- If you're not there, I think he's dead.

1060
01:44:41,731 --> 01:44:44,567
<i>If we see 'em whack each other,
we can get 'em for that.</i>

1061
01:44:44,692 --> 01:44:47,653
You hole up in the hotel
so I can find you if I need you.

1062
01:44:47,778 --> 01:44:50,364
Just be there. I think Jack's goin' down.

1063
01:45:03,544 --> 01:45:06,005
Jackie. How you doin', man?

1064
01:45:08,216 --> 01:45:11,093
- You said you were workin' tonight.
- Yeah. Yeah.

1065
01:45:11,219 --> 01:45:15,640
- Look, I'm sorry I yelled at you.
- Forget it.

1066
01:45:15,765 --> 01:45:20,853
You heard something like that on the
street, but you know it's fuckin' bullshit.

1067
01:45:20,978 --> 01:45:24,732
Whoever told you, we'll talk
with him after the pick-up.

1068
01:45:26,317 --> 01:45:29,028
I want you to back me up, OK?

1069
01:45:29,153 --> 01:45:31,197
Hey, I'm there.

1070
01:45:44,877 --> 01:45:47,380
Why are we here? I thought Battery Park.

1071
01:45:47,505 --> 01:45:50,174
The meeting's been changed to Pier 84.

1072
01:45:50,299 --> 01:45:55,012
Frankie figured it'd be safer.
Guineas won't try jack shit here.

1073
01:46:31,048 --> 01:46:34,343
Listen, you ain't supposed to be here.

1074
01:46:36,470 --> 01:46:39,140
OK, go and wait for me over there.

1075
01:46:40,015 --> 01:46:42,518
- Behind there?
- Yeah. I won't be long.

1076
01:46:42,643 --> 01:46:45,229
- Watch my fuckin' back.
- Yeah.

1077
01:46:50,067 --> 01:46:51,736
Hey.

1078
01:46:55,030 --> 01:46:58,033
I love the noises
Irene makes in bed, man.

1079
01:47:00,369 --> 01:47:02,371
Me, too.

1080
01:47:37,781 --> 01:47:41,118
This is Officer Noonan.
I'm lookin' for Sgt Richardson.

1081
01:47:41,243 --> 01:47:44,663
He's on a stakeout.
That's what I'm calling about.

1082
01:48:10,606 --> 01:48:13,359
Look, I got a change
of 20 for him, all right?

1083
01:48:13,484 --> 01:48:16,237
Tell him it's not Battery Park,
it's Pier 84.

1084
01:48:16,820 --> 01:48:18,864
Hey, Frankie.

1085
01:48:20,824 --> 01:48:22,618
Hi, Jackie.

1086
01:48:23,494 --> 01:48:27,164
- I thought you were the guineas.
- The guineas ain't coming.

1087
01:48:27,289 --> 01:48:30,542
- It's just you and me.
- It's just you and me?

1088
01:48:31,335 --> 01:48:32,753
Yeah.

1089
01:48:47,184 --> 01:48:49,311
Just tell him to get down here!

1090
01:48:55,192 --> 01:48:57,027
Jack!

1091
01:49:54,710 --> 01:49:57,296
What the hell is going on?
You tell us one place

1092
01:49:57,421 --> 01:50:00,507
but the shooters are all
at some other goddamn place!

1093
01:50:00,632 --> 01:50:05,179
You know what they'd do
if they knew I was doin' what I been?

1094
01:50:07,014 --> 01:50:10,434
I'd be strung up on some billboard,
my eyes cut out of my head.

1095
01:50:10,559 --> 01:50:12,770
And I'd fuckin' deserve it.

1096
01:50:12,895 --> 01:50:15,439
I ain't your goddamn social worker.

1097
01:50:15,564 --> 01:50:19,318
Now you just tell me
who whacked out Jack Flannery.

1098
01:50:20,444 --> 01:50:23,363
- I don't know.
- What do you mean, you don't know?

1099
01:50:23,489 --> 01:50:25,616
- You were here.
- I wasn't fuckin' here.

1100
01:50:25,741 --> 01:50:28,619
I was over at that phone booth calling you.

1101
01:50:28,744 --> 01:50:32,581
I should have backed up Jack,
but I was over there doin' my rat job.

1102
01:50:32,706 --> 01:50:35,167
Was Flannery here, or his boy?
Who did you see?

1103
01:50:35,292 --> 01:50:38,212
I don't want to do this
any more, all right?!

1104
01:50:38,337 --> 01:50:43,008
I ain't cut out for this undercover shit!
Get yourself an Italian, cos I quit.

1105
01:50:43,133 --> 01:50:46,553
We're on these suckers!
It's just a matter of timing!

1106
01:50:46,678 --> 01:50:47,679
- Timing?
- Yeah!

1107
01:50:47,804 --> 01:50:52,684
These guys don't know what century it is.
And you talk about fucking timing?

1108
01:50:53,560 --> 01:50:55,604
You know what I did?

1109
01:50:56,271 --> 01:51:00,317
I got my best friend killed.
I got Jack killed. That's what I did.

1110
01:51:00,442 --> 01:51:02,277
But it's fucking over.

1111
01:51:02,402 --> 01:51:06,823
Look at me. See? I quit. Good night.

1112
01:51:06,949 --> 01:51:08,992
- Terry.
- Fuck you.

1113
01:51:16,625 --> 01:51:18,669
Hey, Noonan!

1114
01:51:25,092 --> 01:51:27,177
Fucked up, man.

1115
01:51:42,484 --> 01:51:44,194
Kathleen.

1116
01:51:45,237 --> 01:51:46,822
Hi.

1117
01:51:52,160 --> 01:51:55,080
Nobody even knows
what he was doing out there.

1118
01:52:24,484 --> 01:52:26,153
I'm sorry.

1119
01:52:31,950 --> 01:52:34,995
I couldn't have saved Jackie, could I?

1120
01:52:40,751 --> 01:52:44,087
Even though I know it's not true,
I feel I could have.

1121
01:52:49,217 --> 01:52:52,304
But I should have told him what you were.

1122
01:53:25,921 --> 01:53:27,964
Here, Jack.

1123
01:53:30,509 --> 01:53:32,552
You're bound to get thirsty.

1124
01:53:50,153 --> 01:53:51,863
Hey, Terry.

1125
01:53:56,910 --> 01:53:58,954
How's Kathleen?

1126
01:54:00,539 --> 01:54:04,292
She's holding up pretty good.
She's strong. But it's hard.

1127
01:54:06,545 --> 01:54:08,713
It's you I'm worried about.

1128
01:54:09,798 --> 01:54:11,341
What do you mean?

1129
01:54:13,885 --> 01:54:16,513
Do you know where I was
the night this happened?

1130
01:54:20,475 --> 01:54:22,519
I was on Pier 84.

1131
01:54:36,449 --> 01:54:41,246
Noonan, if you and me
are on a collision course,

1132
01:54:41,371 --> 01:54:43,790
that would not be very smart of you.

1133
01:54:47,711 --> 01:54:50,088
You know how smart you are?

1134
01:54:55,343 --> 01:54:57,637
That's how smart you are.

1135
01:55:14,487 --> 01:55:16,698
He's dead.

1136
01:55:16,823 --> 01:55:19,492
The fuck's dead. Do you see that?

1137
01:55:19,617 --> 01:55:21,411
Motherfucker.

1138
01:55:35,675 --> 01:55:37,719
Who is it?

1139
01:55:38,678 --> 01:55:40,722
<i>Kate?</i>

1140
01:55:43,141 --> 01:55:46,144
Kate, I feel awful
about the things I was.

1141
01:55:49,147 --> 01:55:52,692
Kate, you just gotta give me
a minute on this, all right?

1142
01:55:57,322 --> 01:56:02,327
If you don't want me here, just tell me.
But let me see your face so I believe it.

1143
01:56:02,452 --> 01:56:06,539
Terry, I'm telling you the truth.
I'm telling you the God's truth.

1144
01:56:07,874 --> 01:56:10,960
Bastard! You're dragging me in,
making me part of it!

1145
01:56:11,086 --> 01:56:13,505
You want me to drown?
I gotta save my life!

1146
01:56:13,630 --> 01:56:16,466
I know, but I need to explain.
I need you to understand.

1147
01:56:16,591 --> 01:56:19,719
- I understand.
- You're not listening.

1148
01:56:19,844 --> 01:56:22,472
Would you just fuckin' listen?

1149
01:56:32,857 --> 01:56:37,737
I thought some things.
I could come back.

1150
01:56:39,322 --> 01:56:41,533
I always hated that I'd run away.

1151
01:56:42,492 --> 01:56:47,664
Had nothing to do with you, except I knew
if I tried to tell you, I'd never get away.

1152
01:56:54,128 --> 01:56:57,006
So I was in Boston. I just ended up there.

1153
01:57:04,556 --> 01:57:06,766
It seemed far enough away.

1154
01:57:11,312 --> 01:57:15,108
It come to me then. It just happened.
These things happen.

1155
01:57:15,233 --> 01:57:17,735
Other things happen. It's your life.

1156
01:57:24,409 --> 01:57:28,496
They were looking for somebody to go
undercover who knew the Kitchen,

1157
01:57:28,621 --> 01:57:30,665
who was known.

1158
01:57:32,584 --> 01:57:36,546
I could've said no,
but I thought I could do it.

1159
01:57:37,297 --> 01:57:41,551
It was like this opportunity.
I could look the entire thing in the eye.

1160
01:57:41,676 --> 01:57:47,974
You'd be married, forgotten about me.
And Jack, I would leave him out of it.

1161
01:57:49,350 --> 01:57:51,394
But it was only an idea.

1162
01:57:54,731 --> 01:57:57,483
Nothing to do with the truth. It was just...

1163
01:57:59,277 --> 01:58:01,321
a fuckin' idea, like...

1164
01:58:04,949 --> 01:58:10,538
you believe... in angels or the saints

1165
01:58:10,663 --> 01:58:13,833
or that there's such a thing
as a state of grace,

1166
01:58:15,043 --> 01:58:17,503
and you believe it.

1167
01:58:19,922 --> 01:58:22,925
But it's got nothing to do with reality.

1168
01:58:24,719 --> 01:58:30,224
It's just an idea. You got
your ideas and you got reality.

1169
01:58:32,185 --> 01:58:34,228
They're all...

1170
01:58:40,568 --> 01:58:43,071
They're all fucked up.

1171
01:59:02,590 --> 01:59:04,634
I was going out.

1172
01:59:05,551 --> 01:59:07,929
I gotta go. I gotta get ready.

1173
01:59:11,140 --> 01:59:15,895
He's someone I met at work.
He's taking me out for a drink.

1174
01:59:19,273 --> 01:59:22,193
- Frank killed Jack.
- Did he?

1175
01:59:28,908 --> 01:59:32,120
I gotta go down now. He's waiting.

1176
01:59:35,957 --> 01:59:39,127
- You're cold, Kate.
- Yes, I am.

1177
01:59:40,461 --> 01:59:43,548
I don't mind you got a date.
I really don't.

1178
01:59:43,673 --> 01:59:47,927
I ain't jealous. I got a date, too.

1179
01:59:50,138 --> 01:59:54,642
Is there something you want me
to tell Frankie for you when I see him?

1180
01:59:56,102 --> 01:59:58,729
Make sure, when you leave,
the button's pushed in

1181
01:59:58,855 --> 02:00:01,566
and the door's pulled tight before you go.

1182
02:00:17,999 --> 02:00:20,459
- What did you find out, Pat?
- Nobody knows him.

1183
02:00:20,585 --> 02:00:24,380
- They must've brought him from Boston.
- From Boston, to rat us out.

1184
02:00:24,505 --> 02:00:27,842
Don't matter where
the cocksucker's from. He's dead.

1185
02:00:28,134 --> 02:00:33,848
It's 15,000 when he takes his last breath.
You bring me his rat head, it's 30,000.

1186
02:00:43,316 --> 02:00:45,610
- Where the fuck is he?
- Check it out.

1187
02:00:49,947 --> 02:00:51,490
What the fuck are you doin'?

1188
02:01:44,835 --> 02:01:50,049
<i>After all these years,
a perfect St Patrick's Day.</i>

1189
