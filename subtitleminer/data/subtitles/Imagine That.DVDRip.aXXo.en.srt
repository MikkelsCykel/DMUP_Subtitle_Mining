00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,309
Mr. Danielson?

2
00:00:42,394 --> 00:00:43,895
He took my blanket!

3
00:00:43,979 --> 00:00:45,271
Okay. Everybody calm down!
Calm down, everybody.

4
00:00:45,356 --> 00:00:46,731
You'll get your blanket!

5
00:00:51,904 --> 00:00:54,907
lt's mine! Legally, it's mine! lt's mine!

6
00:00:56,868 --> 00:00:58,786
Nice, Evan. Really nice.

7
00:00:59,746 --> 00:01:01,246
Evan, get help. Get help!

8
00:01:01,331 --> 00:01:03,248
l don't need help!
What l need is my blanket!

9
00:01:03,333 --> 00:01:06,835
- Man, you're crazy!
- l am not crazy! l want my goo-gaa!

10
00:01:07,837 --> 00:01:09,797
l want my goo-gaa!

11
00:01:09,881 --> 00:01:11,715
He wasn't always this way.

12
00:01:13,051 --> 00:01:15,804
Once upon a time, he was a king.

13
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,226
The king of Somewhere.

14
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:22,936
Strong and powerful.

15
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:24,145
What l'm suggesting is that

16
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:26,607
you reallocate 8% of your equity
into international markets.

17
00:01:27,234 --> 00:01:31,278
He protected his loyal subjects
and made them feel safe.

18
00:01:31,738 --> 00:01:32,947
All right, are you looking at the charts?

19
00:01:33,031 --> 00:01:36,617
Well, these are actually very
conservative projections. Yes they are.

20
00:01:36,702 --> 00:01:39,036
But one day he left his Kingdom

21
00:01:39,121 --> 00:01:42,707
and he got lost in the Land of Nowhere.

22
00:01:42,916 --> 00:01:45,418
Something no one could
have ever imagined.

23
00:01:51,919 --> 00:01:55,620
Imagine That

24
00:02:02,937 --> 00:02:04,938
Everybody's upped their stocks...

25
00:02:05,565 --> 00:02:09,192
I am here to taIk about finances,
Wall Street...

26
00:02:26,629 --> 00:02:29,757
In Nowhere Land,
everybody wanted to be king,

27
00:02:29,841 --> 00:02:32,843
or at Ieast they aII try to be.

28
00:02:32,927 --> 00:02:34,928
Evan, it's Noah. I got a feather.

29
00:02:35,013 --> 00:02:36,430
- You got a what?
- A feather.

30
00:02:36,514 --> 00:02:38,057
lt was on my desk with a note attached.

31
00:02:38,141 --> 00:02:39,475
- From Johnny Whitefeather?
- Yup.

32
00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:40,559
What'd the note say?

33
00:02:40,643 --> 00:02:44,104
"l'll be at your 9:00 a.m. See you
in there. Ain't nothing but a thing."

34
00:02:44,189 --> 00:02:47,524
- Wow. Then the rumor must be true.
- What? What rumor?

35
00:02:47,609 --> 00:02:49,068
- Stevens is cashing in.
- What?

36
00:02:49,152 --> 00:02:51,236
- He's selling the company?
- He has to be.

37
00:02:51,321 --> 00:02:53,530
His repIacement is gonna be me
or Johnny!

38
00:02:53,615 --> 00:02:54,698
You're gonna get this job!

39
00:02:56,994 --> 00:02:59,037
- Hey. Good morning!
- Good morning, Mr. Danielson.

40
00:02:59,121 --> 00:03:01,081
- Good morning!
- Good morning, Mr. Danielson.

41
00:03:01,165 --> 00:03:02,707
It was a very strange pIace.

42
00:03:02,792 --> 00:03:04,584
...and they've narrowed it down
to our firm and two others.

43
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:07,295
And it is confirmed, Whitefeather is
gonna be in the meeting.

44
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:11,091
The King was reaIIy unhappy there.
He just couIdn't figure out why.

45
00:03:11,175 --> 00:03:12,884
- Hey, Tod!
- What's up, Mr. D?

46
00:03:12,968 --> 00:03:14,886
Take this down to graphics
and add it to my chart, all right?

47
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:16,596
- After l...
- Now.

48
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,557
- What about the...
- Hey, "now" now, man. What's up?

49
00:03:19,642 --> 00:03:21,935
- How much are we paying that guy?
- He's an unpaid intern.

50
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:23,978
lt might be too much.

51
00:03:24,063 --> 00:03:28,317
l think it was because he was
aIways working to protect his castIe

52
00:03:28,401 --> 00:03:31,320
from those who wanted
to steal his crown.

53
00:03:31,905 --> 00:03:33,322
Johnny Whitefeather.

54
00:03:33,406 --> 00:03:37,035
Evan Danielson.
Fellow salmon swimming upstream.

55
00:03:37,829 --> 00:03:39,996
- After you, sir.
- Thank you.

56
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:46,128
So those of us he left behind
went out into the land to rescue him.

57
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:52,759
Whip, l said l'd sit you down with
our two best financial managers.

58
00:03:52,844 --> 00:03:57,140
Evan's been our number-one guy
for the last eight and a half years.

59
00:03:57,224 --> 00:03:58,933
Johnny's been with us for 16 months,

60
00:03:59,017 --> 00:04:01,936
but he's already
one of our top producers.

61
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:05,565
Either way, you'll be well taken care of
here at Smith/Stevens.

62
00:04:06,692 --> 00:04:08,234
- Evan?
- Mr. Bryson.

63
00:04:08,318 --> 00:04:09,652
You've made some
really sound investments,

64
00:04:09,736 --> 00:04:12,780
but quite frankly, l think we can do
better. Let's see if you agree.

65
00:04:15,742 --> 00:04:16,993
Evan Danielson's office.

66
00:04:17,077 --> 00:04:22,081
Now, this will give you a solid base of
capital and a 9 to 11 % yield, annually.

67
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:25,376
Yeah, l understand. ls it...
His daughter?

68
00:04:26,086 --> 00:04:27,421
Did you call her mother?

69
00:04:28,548 --> 00:04:31,675
Because if l say it's urgent
and he's really, really...

70
00:04:34,095 --> 00:04:35,179
The goo-gaa?

71
00:04:35,263 --> 00:04:38,098
- Fantastic, Evan.
- Thank you, Tom.

72
00:04:38,183 --> 00:04:41,059
- Johnny?
- Thank you, Tom. Whip.

73
00:04:41,769 --> 00:04:45,315
Dave, Lee, Troy.
l see those looks of skepticism,

74
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:48,318
just like old man Stevens
the first week that he hired me.

75
00:04:48,402 --> 00:04:51,863
Said to himself, "l hired an lndian.
Can he handle money?"

76
00:04:51,947 --> 00:04:53,448
And how.

77
00:04:59,122 --> 00:05:01,707
Hey, l really appreciate
you letting me contribute

78
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:04,335
a little piece of venison to your potlatch.

79
00:05:04,878 --> 00:05:06,045
Okay.

80
00:05:07,422 --> 00:05:08,797
We're here under one sky.

81
00:05:08,882 --> 00:05:13,135
All of us, under one sky.
Let's appreciate that.

82
00:05:14,179 --> 00:05:15,512
One sky.

83
00:05:17,557 --> 00:05:20,726
Evan Danielson,
that man over there is a seer.

84
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:22,603
Uses the whole eye.

85
00:05:23,563 --> 00:05:26,523
But there is a difference between sight

86
00:05:28,611 --> 00:05:30,153
and vision.

87
00:05:32,323 --> 00:05:35,992
Sight is about
what lies just in front of us.

88
00:05:37,203 --> 00:05:40,705
Vision is about what lies ahead.

89
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:43,458
- The genius of the hawk...
- Excuse me.

90
00:05:44,001 --> 00:05:45,001
Johnny, sorry to interrupt you

91
00:05:45,086 --> 00:05:47,379
in one of your always interesting stories
about nature,

92
00:05:47,463 --> 00:05:49,965
but, gentlemen, l have...
l'm gonna have to leave you, Mr. Bryson,

93
00:05:50,049 --> 00:05:53,260
in the very capable hands of
my colleague Mr. Noah Kulick here.

94
00:05:53,344 --> 00:05:56,305
l have a little family emergency at my
daughter's school l have to take care of.

95
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:57,723
Thank you for your time, sir.

96
00:05:57,808 --> 00:05:59,559
That's what we're all talking about.

97
00:05:59,644 --> 00:06:03,730
Life, nest, eggs. Circle of life.

98
00:06:03,815 --> 00:06:06,316
Yeah. Hakuna matata.

99
00:06:07,443 --> 00:06:09,027
l'm so sorry, but the school kept calling.

100
00:06:09,112 --> 00:06:10,779
- Don't tell me. The goo-gaa.
- Yeah.

101
00:06:10,863 --> 00:06:12,197
l hate that blanket!

102
00:06:13,283 --> 00:06:16,952
We don't normally allow
any kind of security items at school,

103
00:06:17,036 --> 00:06:19,288
but because of yours
and Trish's separation,

104
00:06:19,372 --> 00:06:20,998
we made a temporary exception.

105
00:06:21,082 --> 00:06:24,543
Unfortunately,
it's just not workable anymore.

106
00:06:25,712 --> 00:06:26,878
Hey, you guys.

107
00:06:26,963 --> 00:06:28,130
So this is why l was called out of work?

108
00:06:28,214 --> 00:06:30,049
Because my daughter's
sitting by herself at recess?

109
00:06:30,134 --> 00:06:32,427
No, the reason l called you,
Mr. Danielson,

110
00:06:32,511 --> 00:06:35,096
is because her class went inside
45 minutes ago.

111
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:39,142
She's still sitting here because
Kupida and Mopida told her to.

112
00:06:39,226 --> 00:06:42,812
- Kupida and Mopida are...
- Yeah. l know. Her imaginary friends.

113
00:06:43,772 --> 00:06:46,107
l told Trish we're gonna have to
do something about that blanket.

114
00:06:46,191 --> 00:06:47,275
Well, Trish and l discussed this,

115
00:06:47,359 --> 00:06:49,110
and we both feel that
what needs to be dealt with

116
00:06:49,194 --> 00:06:52,822
is the reason why she still feels
she needs a blanket.

117
00:06:52,906 --> 00:06:55,700
lt's usually an indication of
some kind of emotional needs

118
00:06:55,784 --> 00:06:57,368
that haven't been met.

119
00:06:57,828 --> 00:07:00,581
What's happening? Are they talking?

120
00:07:00,957 --> 00:07:02,916
Well, you know, sometimes,
these things are like a Band-Aid.

121
00:07:03,001 --> 00:07:04,502
You just have to rip it off.

122
00:07:05,796 --> 00:07:07,005
Right.

123
00:07:08,007 --> 00:07:09,341
Rip it.

124
00:07:10,259 --> 00:07:11,426
Rip.

125
00:07:16,766 --> 00:07:20,185
Kupida. l can't hear you both
at the same time.

126
00:07:20,269 --> 00:07:22,103
Go ahead, Mopida.

127
00:07:23,105 --> 00:07:25,774
Wait. Wait a minute.
Someone's coming.

128
00:07:29,571 --> 00:07:31,030
Hey, Liv.

129
00:07:31,114 --> 00:07:33,699
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hey, baby.

130
00:07:33,784 --> 00:07:36,786
Hey, remember we talked about
how the day was gonna come

131
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:39,413
when you couldn't take the goo-gaa
to school with you anymore?

132
00:07:39,498 --> 00:07:41,040
That day is gonna be today.

133
00:07:41,124 --> 00:07:43,292
So what Daddy's gonna do
is l'm gonna take the goo-gaa.

134
00:07:43,377 --> 00:07:44,460
l'm gonna hold on to it for you.

135
00:07:44,544 --> 00:07:48,214
When you get home from school,
you'll get it back then, all right?

136
00:07:48,298 --> 00:07:50,549
All right, sweetie.
Just give me the goo-gaa.

137
00:07:50,634 --> 00:07:53,302
And you have a great day.
All right, baby.

138
00:08:13,032 --> 00:08:15,326
As you know,
the Mile High City Arts Council

139
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:17,829
relies solely on contributions.

140
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:22,875
Yeah. l've got 12 people and four desks.
We need your money.

141
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:28,464
Mr. Cosgrove, can l call you right back?

142
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:31,552
Trish, please, this is a really bad week.

143
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:35,139
Evan, l told you three months ago
that this week was pledge week.

144
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:36,890
- That's this week?
- Yes.

145
00:08:36,975 --> 00:08:40,185
You promised me you wouldn't do this.
You promised me.

146
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:42,938
Look, Evan,
l know you and her haven't ever...

147
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:44,356
- Trish, please, not this week.
- ...had a chance...

148
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:45,858
- Not this week. l'm begging you.
- ...to connect.

149
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:47,651
- Can we flip-flop and l'll do it next week?
- No!

150
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:48,902
- l promise you...
- No.

151
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:51,488
Evan, even if l could, l wouldn't.

152
00:08:57,745 --> 00:09:01,166
Evan, why did you tell me
you even wanted to have children?

153
00:09:01,709 --> 00:09:04,127
'Cause l did. l do!

154
00:09:06,422 --> 00:09:08,882
l just didn't know l'd be so bad at it.

155
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:12,886
You know, Evan,
you're a really smart guy.

156
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:15,388
You make huge deals every day.

157
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:19,684
l'm sure you'll find a way
to deal with her.

158
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,650
Sweetie, you're gonna go
with Daddy, okay?

159
00:09:26,735 --> 00:09:29,111
- Okay.
- He's so excited.

160
00:09:29,946 --> 00:09:33,575
And l'm gonna call you every night
to say good night.

161
00:09:33,659 --> 00:09:35,660
- Promise?
- You'll be fine. You'll be fine.

162
00:09:35,745 --> 00:09:36,870
- Okay.
- l love you, kiddo.

163
00:09:36,954 --> 00:09:38,288
l love you, too.

164
00:09:53,095 --> 00:09:54,804
Okay, here we go.

165
00:09:57,475 --> 00:09:58,850
Hey, you're a competitive guy.

166
00:09:58,935 --> 00:10:01,687
That's intimidating,
especially in a father figure.

167
00:10:01,772 --> 00:10:04,273
Okay, first of all,
l'm not her father figure.

168
00:10:04,358 --> 00:10:07,235
l'm her father.
And she's the one that's intimidating.

169
00:10:07,319 --> 00:10:09,695
- What?
- Honestly. She just stares at me!

170
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:10,863
Or through me.

171
00:10:10,948 --> 00:10:13,699
She's got this imaginary world
that she goes to

172
00:10:13,784 --> 00:10:17,828
with Kupida and Kapuda and Zupida.
l don't get it.

173
00:10:17,913 --> 00:10:20,498
Look, l'm gonna put this
as gently as possible, okay?

174
00:10:20,582 --> 00:10:21,832
You're a complete idiot.

175
00:10:21,917 --> 00:10:24,710
You feel out of control
and you project that onto her.

176
00:10:24,795 --> 00:10:28,339
Hey, look, man.
Be my friend and be my client.

177
00:10:28,423 --> 00:10:31,092
But don't be Mr. Mystic Man
or whatever that is you call yourself.

178
00:10:31,176 --> 00:10:32,637
- Man Whisperer.
- The Man Whisperer.

179
00:10:32,721 --> 00:10:35,598
John Strother, former cornerback
for the Denver Broncos,

180
00:10:35,683 --> 00:10:37,809
is now known as the "Man Whisperer."

181
00:10:37,893 --> 00:10:40,228
- That's right.
- You be whispering to men.

182
00:10:40,312 --> 00:10:43,898
Look, all l'm saying is that
we all have a little kid inside, right here.

183
00:10:43,983 --> 00:10:45,567
- Yeah. Yeah.
- And he's whispering.

184
00:10:45,651 --> 00:10:47,360
Stop. Please. Stop. Stop!

185
00:10:47,444 --> 00:10:48,444
lf you don't whisper to little Evan,

186
00:10:48,529 --> 00:10:50,863
- you'll never get through to Olivia!
- l'm not whispering to little Evan

187
00:10:50,948 --> 00:10:52,073
- and l'm not whispering with you.
- You just did.

188
00:10:52,157 --> 00:10:53,616
No, l wasn't.
No, l wasn't whispering with you.

189
00:10:53,701 --> 00:10:54,742
l was whispering on the other...

190
00:10:54,827 --> 00:10:56,619
You was finished talking,
and then l said "whisper" after.

191
00:10:56,704 --> 00:10:57,745
l wasn't whispering with you.

192
00:10:57,830 --> 00:10:59,038
Little Evan?
What's wrong with little Evan?

193
00:10:59,123 --> 00:11:02,001
Say it again. Say, "Whisper to little
Evan," one more time. Say it again.

194
00:11:02,085 --> 00:11:03,711
- You know what's gonna happen?
- What's gonna happen? What?

195
00:11:03,795 --> 00:11:06,422
- What you gonna do?
- l'm gonna crash your portfolio.

196
00:11:06,506 --> 00:11:08,424
What's that have to do with anything?

197
00:11:15,307 --> 00:11:17,683
- Hey, baby.
- Hey.

198
00:11:17,767 --> 00:11:20,561
- You wear him out?
- No, but Olivia will.

199
00:11:20,645 --> 00:11:23,897
- Where are they at?
- Upstairs. Princess dress-up.

200
00:11:23,982 --> 00:11:25,941
What? They started without me?

201
00:11:27,027 --> 00:11:30,279
- Hey, Ev. Livvy's upstairs.
- Thanks. Thanks for watching her.

202
00:11:30,363 --> 00:11:32,198
Absolutely. Anytime.

203
00:11:32,283 --> 00:11:36,077
And Trish told me to remind you,
vaccinations on Thursday.

204
00:11:36,162 --> 00:11:38,872
- Okay.
- And Ella's party is Friday.

205
00:11:38,956 --> 00:11:41,958
lt's a sleepover here,
so pack all of her stuff.

206
00:11:42,043 --> 00:11:43,961
And the Fall Sing is Saturday.

207
00:11:44,046 --> 00:11:46,964
Livvy's really nervous,
so go through her songs with her.

208
00:11:47,049 --> 00:11:49,091
She doesn't think l'm gonna
remember all this, does she?

209
00:11:49,176 --> 00:11:50,885
No. She does not.

210
00:11:55,724 --> 00:11:58,809
Oh, no. Come on, guys.

211
00:11:58,894 --> 00:12:01,896
More! l want to be beautiful!

212
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:03,315
Hey, Ev.

213
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:04,983
l've got the perfect size seat
for little Evan.

214
00:12:05,068 --> 00:12:07,152
- Come, sit down.
- l think l'm fine. l'm okay.

215
00:12:07,236 --> 00:12:09,321
Come on, Liv, let's go. We gotta go.

216
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:12,741
- Bye, Olivia.
- Bye, Ella.

217
00:12:12,825 --> 00:12:14,201
- Bye, Liv.
- Bye.

218
00:12:14,285 --> 00:12:15,994
Denver Broncos, huh?

219
00:12:21,751 --> 00:12:23,919
No, Mopida, l can't go.

220
00:12:25,505 --> 00:12:26,838
No.

221
00:12:27,382 --> 00:12:28,757
Well, yeah.

222
00:12:34,932 --> 00:12:36,933
Are you sure, Mopida?

223
00:12:40,604 --> 00:12:42,647
Okay, if you say so.

224
00:12:47,569 --> 00:12:50,571
What? He actually had a snake?
A real snake?

225
00:12:51,281 --> 00:12:52,950
Nobody's going to fall
for this whole shtick.

226
00:12:53,034 --> 00:12:56,120
What we have to do is find a better way
to do this, all right?

227
00:12:56,621 --> 00:12:57,663
No, no, listen.

228
00:12:57,747 --> 00:13:00,457
Here's what we're gonna do.
We're gonna eliminate TriTek.

229
00:13:00,542 --> 00:13:02,084
No, no, no, no.
Look, l'm looking at the specs here,

230
00:13:02,168 --> 00:13:04,504
and l don't like what l see. First of...

231
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:08,383
Hold on a second.

232
00:13:09,135 --> 00:13:10,719
Olivia, what are you doing?
Go back to bed.

233
00:13:10,803 --> 00:13:14,347
- You said you'd be a king.
- l said l'd do what?

234
00:13:14,432 --> 00:13:19,310
You said last time that next time
you'd do dress up, and you'd be a king.

235
00:13:19,395 --> 00:13:21,312
Well, l don't recall saying that.
l don't remember saying that.

236
00:13:21,397 --> 00:13:22,564
And even if l did say that,

237
00:13:22,648 --> 00:13:24,607
l don't have the right stuff
to do king stuff here.

238
00:13:24,692 --> 00:13:27,235
l don't have any king clothes,
and l don't have a king hat.

239
00:13:27,319 --> 00:13:28,903
lt's called a crown.

240
00:13:28,988 --> 00:13:30,530
- Evan, you there?
- Hold on a second.

241
00:13:30,614 --> 00:13:32,323
Whatever. Olivia, please, just go to bed.

242
00:13:32,408 --> 00:13:33,492
l will sleep in here.

243
00:13:33,577 --> 00:13:35,870
No, you're sleeping in your room.
That's why you have a bedroom.

244
00:13:35,954 --> 00:13:39,248
- You go sleep in your bedroom.
- l do not want to sleep in there.

245
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:43,669
All right. You're gonna go to sleep?
You promise?

246
00:13:44,546 --> 00:13:48,424
Go over there and lay down. Be quiet,
Olivia. l have to work here, all right?

247
00:13:49,426 --> 00:13:51,510
l'm sorry, man. Where was l?
What was l saying?

248
00:13:51,595 --> 00:13:53,888
Listen, this is where
we're gonna snake Whitefeather.

249
00:13:53,972 --> 00:13:56,182
'Cause he's thinking we're gonna go
for the obvious play, Solocom.

250
00:13:56,266 --> 00:13:59,727
But what we're gonna do... Digital Fiber.
Digital Fiber is the play.

251
00:13:59,811 --> 00:14:02,063
- That's the obvious choice.
- Stop saying...

252
00:14:02,148 --> 00:14:03,482
Hold on a second.

253
00:14:03,984 --> 00:14:05,568
- Olivia.
- What?

254
00:14:07,404 --> 00:14:10,531
Yeah, sorry about that, man. Look.
No, no, no.

255
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,034
You gotta be quiet.

256
00:14:13,494 --> 00:14:15,703
lt's his job, not yours.

257
00:14:17,706 --> 00:14:19,749
Can l call you back? Thank you.

258
00:14:21,877 --> 00:14:23,211
All right, that's it.

259
00:14:24,171 --> 00:14:26,172
Now, l asked you to be quiet,
but you don't listen.

260
00:14:26,256 --> 00:14:28,090
- Yes, l do.
- No, you don't.

261
00:14:28,175 --> 00:14:29,967
l asked you not to talk,
but you kept talking.

262
00:14:30,052 --> 00:14:32,261
You don't know how to listen,
so since you don't know how to listen,

263
00:14:32,346 --> 00:14:34,681
you take your blanket
and you go in your room. Go.

264
00:14:38,311 --> 00:14:39,728
Come on now.

265
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:41,396
Come on, come on, really, please.

266
00:14:41,481 --> 00:14:44,441
Come on, please. l'm saying, "Please."
Go to bed, please.

267
00:14:55,495 --> 00:14:56,870
Now what?

268
00:14:57,914 --> 00:14:59,414
What is it?

269
00:15:01,209 --> 00:15:04,754
Look, l told you,
l will play king with you some other time.

270
00:15:04,839 --> 00:15:07,423
Daddy has a lot of work to do.
All right? So...

271
00:15:09,802 --> 00:15:11,052
What?

272
00:15:12,138 --> 00:15:13,764
l do listen.

273
00:15:51,095 --> 00:15:52,512
l'm sorry.

274
00:15:53,306 --> 00:15:55,932
How many days till l go back home?

275
00:16:03,733 --> 00:16:06,652
I've gone over everything we taIked
about Iast night, and it aII Iooks great.

276
00:16:06,737 --> 00:16:08,905
That's perfect, because
Whitefeather's gonna go with Solocom.

277
00:16:08,989 --> 00:16:10,740
- Of course.
- But we got a better alternative.

278
00:16:10,824 --> 00:16:11,908
- Digital Fiber.
- Got a good record.

279
00:16:11,992 --> 00:16:13,326
Exactly.
l'm gonna call you in 20 minutes,

280
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:14,911
- right after l drop Olivia off to school.
- Very nice.

281
00:16:14,995 --> 00:16:16,370
All right. Okay.

282
00:16:16,455 --> 00:16:18,456
Come on, honey. Let's get going.
Daddy's sort of in a hurry.

283
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:20,249
l think this milk is spoiled.

284
00:16:20,334 --> 00:16:22,252
No. That's not possible,
because l checked this milk.

285
00:16:22,337 --> 00:16:24,588
Come on, let's go! Let's go.

286
00:16:44,693 --> 00:16:46,945
What if we say
we just get a muffin, huh?

287
00:16:47,029 --> 00:16:49,280
Tomorrow, can we make pancakes?

288
00:16:49,365 --> 00:16:51,115
Honey, l don't know
if l have the right stuff for that,

289
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,868
- you know, supply-wise or skill-wise.
- l can help you.

290
00:16:53,953 --> 00:16:55,787
l got a better idea.
How about we leave a note for Graciella,

291
00:16:55,871 --> 00:16:57,330
she can make some pancakes,
put them in the freezer,

292
00:16:57,414 --> 00:16:59,415
we'll thaw them out
and eat them tomorrow, huh? Yeah.

293
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:02,377
- Not what l was thinking.
- Move! Let's move!

294
00:17:02,461 --> 00:17:05,672
Hey, you didn't pack my Fall Sing music.

295
00:17:07,384 --> 00:17:09,677
Okay, your Fall Sing...
Where is that stuff?

296
00:17:09,761 --> 00:17:12,721
Okay, here it is! Right here.
Right here's your music.

297
00:17:15,392 --> 00:17:16,767
Rick?

298
00:17:16,851 --> 00:17:20,896
- l thought you said you were in a hurry.
- Yeah. l'm coming right now.

299
00:17:26,403 --> 00:17:29,196
Okay, stop, stop, stop. Once is enough.

300
00:17:32,868 --> 00:17:35,620
Hey, does Mommy ever make
a new friend, you know, in like a...

301
00:17:35,705 --> 00:17:37,748
- You mean Rick?
- Yes, Rick.

302
00:17:37,833 --> 00:17:41,502
ls that the guy from Mommy's work with
the spiked hair and the pointed face?

303
00:17:41,586 --> 00:17:44,672
"Hello, l'd like to talk to you for a sec."
That guy?

304
00:17:44,756 --> 00:17:47,758
No, that's Skip. Rick is tall.

305
00:17:47,843 --> 00:17:50,928
Handsome, too.
He looks like Prince Charming.

306
00:17:52,764 --> 00:17:54,056
Good for Rick.

307
00:17:55,434 --> 00:17:57,560
- Morning, Graciella.
- Morning, Mr. Danielson.

308
00:17:57,644 --> 00:18:00,187
- Hi, Graciella.
- Hi, Olivia. Nice to see you.

309
00:18:00,272 --> 00:18:02,023
Hey, Graciella! One thing.

310
00:18:02,107 --> 00:18:04,608
Can you please make some pancakes
and put them in the freezer for us?

311
00:18:06,111 --> 00:18:07,571
Thank you so much. All right.

312
00:18:07,655 --> 00:18:09,698
Hey, what are you, a button maniac?
Stop it.

313
00:18:09,782 --> 00:18:10,949
Press one floor and leave it alone.

314
00:18:11,701 --> 00:18:12,909
Daddy?

315
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:16,288
Kupida wanted me to tell you something.

316
00:18:16,372 --> 00:18:17,998
Yeah. Go ahead.

317
00:18:18,082 --> 00:18:21,793
She heard what you were saying
on the phone last night,

318
00:18:22,336 --> 00:18:25,547
and she told me to tell you
she doesn't like either of them.

319
00:18:25,631 --> 00:18:27,674
Which guy? Rick or Skip?

320
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:31,595
The companies,
Solocom and Digital Fiber.

321
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:36,349
Kupida doesn't like them,
neither does Mopida, and Qwali agrees.

322
00:18:37,352 --> 00:18:40,521
Daddy, do you know
why they don't like them?

323
00:18:41,149 --> 00:18:43,776
Daddy, l said,
do you know why they don't like them?

324
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:46,153
- Why?
- Because they're broken.

325
00:18:46,237 --> 00:18:49,823
- Do you know which one they do like?
- No, honey, l have no idea.

326
00:18:49,908 --> 00:18:52,826
The first one,
the one you threw away, TriTek.

327
00:18:52,911 --> 00:18:55,454
- Are you sure you're listening?
- Yes, Daddy sure is listening,

328
00:18:55,538 --> 00:18:57,456
but come on, we got to go. Let's go.

329
00:18:59,084 --> 00:19:01,001
Kupida and Mopida really like it.

330
00:19:01,086 --> 00:19:03,170
- You know why?
- Why is that?

331
00:19:03,254 --> 00:19:07,257
- Because it has buried treasure.
- Yeah? Okay.

332
00:19:07,343 --> 00:19:10,345
- You aren't listening.
- No, no, Daddy's listening.

333
00:19:15,309 --> 00:19:18,353
Okay, so, we're here,
and we're going in.

334
00:19:18,437 --> 00:19:21,022
And there's something
you have to go without.

335
00:19:46,716 --> 00:19:50,219
Hey, come on, come on,
Olivia, let's go, let's go.

336
00:19:52,932 --> 00:19:54,474
- Liv! How are you?
- Hi!

337
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:57,144
- Give me five.
- Put her there. Put her there.

338
00:19:57,228 --> 00:19:58,937
Okay, guys, l got, like,
three meetings back to back.

339
00:19:59,021 --> 00:20:01,523
She's just gonna sit down here
and get settled down here.

340
00:20:01,607 --> 00:20:03,150
Let's get settled in. All right.

341
00:20:03,234 --> 00:20:05,277
- Mike, which one can l get rid of?
- Well...

342
00:20:05,361 --> 00:20:06,486
That one.

343
00:20:06,571 --> 00:20:08,156
No. You don't say that one.
That's sacrilege.

344
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,575
That's Dante D'Enzo.
We never get rid of Dante D'Enzo.

345
00:20:10,659 --> 00:20:14,203
- Kupida says he's boring.
- Well, Kupida is estúpida.

346
00:20:14,288 --> 00:20:16,914
Because he happens to be one of
the greatest investors on the planet.

347
00:20:16,999 --> 00:20:18,708
- No, he's boring.
- No, no.

348
00:20:18,792 --> 00:20:20,334
Why am l standing here
arguing with you about Kupida?

349
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:22,420
Let me get something for you to watch.

350
00:20:23,547 --> 00:20:25,339
There you go. There's the...
What's that? Barney.

351
00:20:25,424 --> 00:20:27,925
Okay, look, can you watch my kid for
me? You have my back for me, Mike?

352
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:29,760
Watch that Barney and l'll be...

353
00:20:31,805 --> 00:20:34,098
That's not Barney. That's Blue.

354
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:38,186
And now I'm going to tap your knee
very gentIy...

355
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:39,605
Did you see that?

356
00:20:39,689 --> 00:20:42,649
...by increasing your family's holdings
in optical fiber.

357
00:20:42,734 --> 00:20:45,485
lf you take a look at these charts here
on page six in your folders...

358
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,038
Granted, Solocom looks solid,

359
00:20:56,122 --> 00:20:58,999
but if you pore over the financials,
it's crystal clear,

360
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:01,628
the smart play here is Digital Fiber.

361
00:21:01,712 --> 00:21:04,923
- Kupida says no.
- Okay.

362
00:21:05,007 --> 00:21:07,383
- No.
- Let's move on Digital Fiber.

363
00:21:07,468 --> 00:21:10,137
l'm sorry. Don't move on Digital Fiber?

364
00:21:10,222 --> 00:21:13,390
Oh, no. Yes, yes. Do go, yes. No.

365
00:21:13,475 --> 00:21:16,393
- No?
- Yes. Yes, go, yes.

366
00:21:21,816 --> 00:21:23,859
- Mother?
- Tom?

367
00:21:24,527 --> 00:21:27,404
Johnny?
Perhaps you have something to add?

368
00:21:27,489 --> 00:21:32,076
Not really. lt's good work from Evan.
Digital Fiber. Solocom.

369
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,827
l struggled with it myself last night.

370
00:21:33,912 --> 00:21:36,038
l went to sleep convinced
l was gonna take

371
00:21:36,122 --> 00:21:40,335
the Pressman family towards
that pretty face, Solocom.

372
00:21:40,419 --> 00:21:44,631
But in the middle of the night,
the dream sparrow comes to me.

373
00:21:44,715 --> 00:21:48,260
She taps me on the forehead and says,
"Wake up, handsome brave.

374
00:21:48,344 --> 00:21:51,429
"There's something happening
in Uzbekistan."

375
00:21:51,514 --> 00:21:52,847
"Uzbeka-what?

376
00:21:52,932 --> 00:21:56,393
"lt's 4:30 in the morning, little friend.
l'm sleeping."

377
00:21:56,477 --> 00:22:01,439
But she said there's a kalacampi,
the worm hidden in the apple.

378
00:22:02,358 --> 00:22:04,985
And l let the dream sparrow fly away.

379
00:22:05,319 --> 00:22:08,113
- The dream sparrow.
- But l investigated what she said

380
00:22:08,197 --> 00:22:11,868
on the white fire grid
you people call the lnternet.

381
00:22:12,495 --> 00:22:15,163
At 4:15 this morning,
Mountain Standard Time,

382
00:22:15,248 --> 00:22:18,625
the Uzbeki government
followed through on a series of threats

383
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:21,378
to detonate a nuclear weapon. Boom.

384
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:24,464
Digital Fiber, Solocom,

385
00:22:24,549 --> 00:22:28,885
all of their underground cabling
that they were relying upon,

386
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:32,848
lost in that mushroom cloud.
Do l blame Uzbekistan? No.

387
00:22:32,932 --> 00:22:36,018
Defend yourself, mountain republic,
just like you said you would.

388
00:22:36,102 --> 00:22:37,519
You followed through.

389
00:22:40,691 --> 00:22:42,984
But 200 miles south, in Turkmenistan,

390
00:22:43,068 --> 00:22:47,780
a little company called TriTek,
didn't look like much to me yesterday,

391
00:22:47,865 --> 00:22:53,286
but today, their 6,000 miles of
already-buried underground cabling,

392
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:58,708
looking a lot more valuable.
TriTek, baby. l say we go into TriTek.

393
00:23:00,294 --> 00:23:02,003
- Let's keep our fingers crossed, huh?
- Okay.

394
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:08,009
Evan, you mind if l sit in on your 11:00?

395
00:23:08,093 --> 00:23:11,347
Well, Johnny, that's not up to me.
That's up to the client.

396
00:23:11,431 --> 00:23:12,639
So it's cool?

397
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:15,684
Because l checked with the client,
and they said it's okay.

398
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:17,978
That's great. That's great.

399
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:20,774
Hey, ain't nothing but a thing.

400
00:23:20,858 --> 00:23:23,526
The herd moves on,
but you're going to be fine, little elk.

401
00:23:23,611 --> 00:23:26,529
You're going to be just fine.
One sky, man.

402
00:23:30,993 --> 00:23:34,746
One sky.

403
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:38,541
l didn't realize you guys were so tight.

404
00:23:38,626 --> 00:23:39,834
You know what l want you to do
for me, Tod?

405
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:42,380
Go down to legal
and check something out for me. Okay?

406
00:23:42,464 --> 00:23:43,881
l want to know
what the ramifications are

407
00:23:43,965 --> 00:23:46,509
if l were to stab Johnny Whitefeather.

408
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:54,225
- Daddy!
- Not now, sweetie.

409
00:23:54,309 --> 00:23:56,060
- But, Daddy!
- Hey, not now.

410
00:23:56,144 --> 00:23:58,312
And listen to me, Liv.
This is where Daddy works.

411
00:23:58,397 --> 00:24:00,147
You cannot come down here
and stand outside my meetings

412
00:24:00,232 --> 00:24:01,816
and flail your arms around.

413
00:24:02,984 --> 00:24:06,112
- Rose!
- Yeah.

414
00:24:06,196 --> 00:24:09,907
Can you take Olivia downstairs
and get her a muffin or something?

415
00:24:09,991 --> 00:24:11,618
- Are you hungry, honey?
- No.

416
00:24:11,702 --> 00:24:13,161
l don't think she's hungry.

417
00:24:14,205 --> 00:24:15,789
She's starving. l can see that.

418
00:24:15,873 --> 00:24:18,083
Come on. Here we go.
Let's go get a muffin.

419
00:24:18,167 --> 00:24:20,001
Have some girl talk.

420
00:24:25,842 --> 00:24:27,259
- Hey, Ev.
- Hey, give me a second, Noah.

421
00:24:27,343 --> 00:24:29,929
l'm trying to find my notes for the 11:00.

422
00:24:30,013 --> 00:24:34,600
Actually, it pertains to the 11:00.
Quickly, two things.

423
00:24:34,685 --> 00:24:39,021
First, Johnny has just asked me
to join his tribe.

424
00:24:40,732 --> 00:24:44,278
l can't believe it.
He actually calls his team a tribe.

425
00:24:44,362 --> 00:24:46,697
Yeah, it's stupid.

426
00:24:48,199 --> 00:24:51,952
- And you said yes, didn't you?
- No, no, absolutely not, at first.

427
00:24:52,036 --> 00:24:53,787
But then he put
so much pressure on me.

428
00:24:53,872 --> 00:24:55,956
He needed an answer immediately. So...

429
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:59,293
lt's all well and good, Noah.
But thanks for your loyalty, all right.

430
00:24:59,377 --> 00:25:02,296
Now if you don't mind, l gotta get ready
in about 10 minutes, so if you'd be so...

431
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:06,383
That's the other thing.
About the 11:00, Johnny moved it up.

432
00:25:06,468 --> 00:25:08,051
He had a conflict at 11:00.

433
00:25:08,136 --> 00:25:10,471
Johnny moved my meeting
with my clients?

434
00:25:10,555 --> 00:25:12,682
Yeah. lt started at 10:30,

435
00:25:12,766 --> 00:25:17,687
so l popped in here as a courtesy to you,
because we were so tight for so long.

436
00:25:17,771 --> 00:25:20,523
And thank you so much for hiring me.

437
00:25:20,608 --> 00:25:22,734
- Out!
- Okay, l gotta go.

438
00:25:24,236 --> 00:25:25,570
Rose!

439
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:29,949
Where are my notes for the 11:00?

440
00:25:30,034 --> 00:25:32,785
- Sorry. l think they're in there.
- They're not in there.

441
00:25:38,918 --> 00:25:43,882
Mr. D, l talked to the lawyer guy upstairs
and he confirmed my hunch

442
00:25:44,425 --> 00:25:48,261
about the whole stabbing
Mr. Whitefeather thing.

443
00:25:49,013 --> 00:25:52,766
lt's a definite no-can-do
from a legal standpoint.

444
00:25:53,392 --> 00:25:57,479
- Go away, Tod. Go very far away.
- Yes. Right.

445
00:26:01,692 --> 00:26:03,318
l can't find them.

446
00:26:03,402 --> 00:26:04,653
Well, they're here somewhere, Rose.

447
00:26:04,737 --> 00:26:06,238
Please, l can't make it happen
without my notes.

448
00:26:06,322 --> 00:26:08,031
- Find my notes. Please.
- Okay. Okay. Okay.

449
00:26:08,115 --> 00:26:10,951
All of a sudden, l'm late for a meeting
that l was early for in the first place.

450
00:26:11,035 --> 00:26:13,412
All right. lt's all right.
We're gonna find them.

451
00:26:15,582 --> 00:26:21,629
Oh, my God.

452
00:26:22,297 --> 00:26:23,881
Did you draw on my worksheets?

453
00:26:23,966 --> 00:26:27,051
- Qwali said l could.
- Qwali said you could?

454
00:26:27,135 --> 00:26:29,053
Qwali said you could.
But let me tell you something, Olivia.

455
00:26:29,137 --> 00:26:30,846
l'm getting ready to go into
a meeting with grown people.

456
00:26:30,931 --> 00:26:32,139
They're gonna be judging Daddy,

457
00:26:32,224 --> 00:26:33,975
and all of a sudden,
my worksheets have

458
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:36,978
pictures of flowers and sparkly stuff

459
00:26:37,062 --> 00:26:39,564
and, what is this,
people kissing or something?

460
00:26:39,648 --> 00:26:41,315
Kupida says they might get married.

461
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:44,528
And why is this sticky?
Why is this so sticky?

462
00:26:44,612 --> 00:26:46,989
lt's sparkle glue. Sparkly.

463
00:26:47,073 --> 00:26:48,574
This is a disaster.

464
00:27:06,594 --> 00:27:08,511
- A horror show.
- Live.

465
00:27:08,929 --> 00:27:12,682
Love. Laugh. Walahala!

466
00:27:12,766 --> 00:27:17,605
Live. Love. Laugh. Walahala!

467
00:27:20,150 --> 00:27:23,110
l have never, guys,
l have never felt so jazzed

468
00:27:23,194 --> 00:27:27,948
about the prospects of our pension fund!
l mean it. l am jazzed!

469
00:27:28,033 --> 00:27:29,908
l wish l could take credit, Fred,

470
00:27:29,993 --> 00:27:33,287
but we gotta give that to the Walahala,
Mr. Waterfall.

471
00:27:33,371 --> 00:27:35,706
Hey, rain down prosperity!

472
00:27:36,499 --> 00:27:39,543
- And how.
- Thank you, Johnny!

473
00:27:44,759 --> 00:27:49,179
Evan. Everybody,
you remember Evan Danielson.

474
00:27:49,263 --> 00:27:52,474
l would hope so, after seven years
of working with you guys.

475
00:27:52,558 --> 00:27:55,852
Yeah. Of course.
How's it going there, Evan?

476
00:27:55,936 --> 00:27:58,688
Good to see you.
Hey, look, while we were waiting for you,

477
00:27:58,773 --> 00:28:03,778
Mr. Whitefeather, he made some rather
radical suggestions, as you can see.

478
00:28:04,529 --> 00:28:05,488
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

479
00:28:05,572 --> 00:28:09,450
So what do you think, Evan?
You agree with Mr. Whitefeather here,

480
00:28:09,534 --> 00:28:14,665
or do you have some special insight
that you'd like to share with us about

481
00:28:14,749 --> 00:28:16,833
how you would increase the fund?

482
00:28:17,877 --> 00:28:21,505
l think l do have some insight.
l don't agree with Mr. Whitefeather.

483
00:28:26,928 --> 00:28:28,553
What l was going to suggest was

484
00:28:28,638 --> 00:28:32,849
a 4% reallocation
away from convertible arbitrage.

485
00:28:35,603 --> 00:28:37,771
And in addition

486
00:28:42,443 --> 00:28:44,362
to that...

487
00:28:44,446 --> 00:28:46,656
Okay. Good. Thank you.

488
00:28:47,616 --> 00:28:51,035
l don't know about you guys,
but this is good for me.

489
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,453
Didn't l tell you he was good?

490
00:28:52,538 --> 00:28:53,913
Hey, man.

491
00:28:53,997 --> 00:28:56,791
Sometimes the best spear
is the one you don't throw.

492
00:28:56,875 --> 00:28:58,376
Ain't nothing but a thing.

493
00:29:03,298 --> 00:29:05,883
"Ain't nothing but a thing."
What does that even mean, Johnny?

494
00:29:05,968 --> 00:29:09,054
lt's not a thing, but it is?
lt's something, but it's not a thing?

495
00:29:09,139 --> 00:29:13,726
But it's not. But it's something.
What is... l'm confused! What's that?

496
00:29:13,810 --> 00:29:17,063
You're a seeker, brother crow.
You should ride that...

497
00:29:17,148 --> 00:29:18,732
You know what? Stop it right now.
Stop it!

498
00:29:18,816 --> 00:29:19,941
Because l'm not going to be
subjected to your

499
00:29:20,025 --> 00:29:22,360
Dr. Seuss-meets-Pocahontas
stuff today.

500
00:29:22,445 --> 00:29:25,739
"One sky, two sky, red sky, blue sky!"

501
00:29:25,823 --> 00:29:29,451
Evan, that's shadow time. Okay.
Let's keep that in the shadows.

502
00:29:29,535 --> 00:29:32,579
Oh, no. Please, please, please,
make him stop. Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

503
00:29:32,663 --> 00:29:36,458
Lord, Lord, Lord, make him stop, Lord.
Why are you falling for this?

504
00:29:36,542 --> 00:29:38,585
What's the matter? l've been
working for you for seven years.

505
00:29:38,669 --> 00:29:41,713
And you know that, Fred!
l went to your grandson's birthday party,

506
00:29:41,797 --> 00:29:44,007
and l went to Aspen with you
and your wife for the whole weekend.

507
00:29:44,091 --> 00:29:45,176
We got history together.

508
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:47,678
You gonna throw it all away because
this guy showed you some waterfalls

509
00:29:47,763 --> 00:29:49,096
and got you chanting "Walla Walla"?

510
00:29:49,181 --> 00:29:52,767
Evan, we're always looking for fresh
ideas, and he showed us some.

511
00:29:52,851 --> 00:29:54,143
lt's like Johnny says.

512
00:29:54,227 --> 00:29:59,273
You got turtles that live in their shell
and turtles that live out of their shell.

513
00:29:59,357 --> 00:30:00,983
What? What? What did you just say?

514
00:30:01,067 --> 00:30:03,110
What did he say? Johnny just said...
What did he tell you?

515
00:30:03,195 --> 00:30:04,945
What was that?
What did he say? What?

516
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:07,239
He said turtles with no shell...

517
00:30:07,324 --> 00:30:08,783
Called geckos, man.

518
00:30:10,577 --> 00:30:12,077
That's not even biology!

519
00:30:12,162 --> 00:30:15,665
How could you listen...
What's a frog, Johnny? A short snake?

520
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:18,043
You want new ideas?
Special new ideas. Okay.

521
00:30:18,127 --> 00:30:20,713
'Cause slow, predictable growth
is so boring.

522
00:30:20,798 --> 00:30:23,049
Let's talk about... Let's talk about
a little company called ChemStar.

523
00:30:23,133 --> 00:30:25,384
Let's talk about this company.
l say go out and buy lots of it.

524
00:30:25,469 --> 00:30:29,222
Buy lots and lots of ChemStar.
You know why? Because it's sparkly.

525
00:30:29,306 --> 00:30:31,974
Everybody knows that
everybody loves sparkly things,

526
00:30:32,059 --> 00:30:35,144
so go out and buy some ChemStar
because it's sparkly!

527
00:30:35,229 --> 00:30:36,896
Okay. Here's fresh new idea
number two.

528
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:39,524
These companies were so stinky
l had to snip them all away.

529
00:30:39,608 --> 00:30:42,652
Snip! Snip! Snip!
lf you're not good, you got to go!

530
00:30:42,736 --> 00:30:45,112
Okay.
Here's fresh new idea number three!

531
00:30:45,197 --> 00:30:47,241
Look at that.
You got YellowFin and AeroDyne.

532
00:30:47,325 --> 00:30:50,202
What are they doing?
YellowFin and AeroDyne.

533
00:30:50,286 --> 00:30:53,580
They're kissing.
And what does kissing usually lead to?

534
00:30:56,042 --> 00:30:58,669
Marriage! They're getting married!

535
00:30:58,753 --> 00:31:04,091
YeIIowFin and AeroDyne sitting in a tree
K- l-S-S-l-N-G

536
00:31:04,175 --> 00:31:06,510
First comes Iove, come on
Then comes marriage...

537
00:31:06,594 --> 00:31:08,762
- Evan. Stop.
- No, don't stop me.

538
00:31:08,847 --> 00:31:13,600
l got more. l got more, Tom!
Fresh new idea number four. NeoDyne.

539
00:31:13,685 --> 00:31:15,060
NeoDyne,
that's your biggest holding, right?

540
00:31:15,144 --> 00:31:16,729
6% of your equity is in NeoDyne.

541
00:31:16,814 --> 00:31:19,023
You know what fresh new thinking has
to say about that company?

542
00:31:19,108 --> 00:31:20,692
Pull out! Pull out now. You know why?

543
00:31:20,776 --> 00:31:22,694
Because NeoDyne is about
to have his pants pulled down

544
00:31:22,778 --> 00:31:24,571
and have his underwear exposed.
Know what's in the underwear?

545
00:31:24,655 --> 00:31:26,155
- No.
- Poop.

546
00:31:27,199 --> 00:31:28,450
Poop is in the underwear.

547
00:31:28,535 --> 00:31:31,829
Poop. Nasty doo-doo. Stinky ca-ca.
So here's a recap.

548
00:31:31,913 --> 00:31:34,456
NeoDyne, pants pulled down,
butt exposed,

549
00:31:34,541 --> 00:31:36,834
poo-poo, doo-doo, stinky ca-ca. Okay?

550
00:31:36,918 --> 00:31:39,545
Those are my fresh new...
You take this. You hold on to it.

551
00:31:39,629 --> 00:31:41,589
So those are my new ideas.
Thank you so much!

552
00:31:41,673 --> 00:31:45,467
Raining down!
Fresh ideas and Walla Walla!

553
00:31:54,145 --> 00:31:57,898
- Did you tell them what Kupida said?
- Yeah. l sure did.

554
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:00,400
Did they like it?

555
00:32:00,484 --> 00:32:02,944
l imagine it was
a lot of fun to watch, honey.

556
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:10,827
Oh, God. What have l done?
What have l done?

557
00:32:10,912 --> 00:32:12,913
ls everything okay?

558
00:32:22,466 --> 00:32:23,799
Hey, Ev?

559
00:32:24,718 --> 00:32:27,511
Stevens wants to see you. Yeah.

560
00:32:50,496 --> 00:32:54,165
- He just kind of flipped out.
- He lost it, man. He lost it.

561
00:32:54,249 --> 00:32:57,335
Look, whatever you heard l said,
it's probably a lot worse.

562
00:32:57,419 --> 00:33:01,214
- l heard you said poop.
- Yeah, l said poop. Twice.

563
00:33:01,507 --> 00:33:02,674
Nice.

564
00:33:06,261 --> 00:33:07,971
l will be back in as much time

565
00:33:08,055 --> 00:33:10,765
as it officially takes to say,
"You're fired," all right?

566
00:33:31,204 --> 00:33:33,330
Evan, what...

567
00:33:33,873 --> 00:33:35,082
Tom, l don't know what...

568
00:33:35,166 --> 00:33:38,669
l'm still trying to process
what just happened in there.

569
00:33:38,753 --> 00:33:41,005
So am l, too. Really, Tom.

570
00:33:41,089 --> 00:33:43,674
How did you know
about all those things?

571
00:33:43,758 --> 00:33:48,264
Listen to me, Tom. There's... What?

572
00:33:48,348 --> 00:33:50,474
The two companies
you said were kissing.

573
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:51,851
AeroDyne and YellowFin.

574
00:33:51,935 --> 00:33:54,687
- What did you mean by that?
- l just...

575
00:33:54,771 --> 00:33:57,440
My brother-in-law
sits on the board ofAeroDyne.

576
00:33:57,524 --> 00:34:01,527
For 18 months, they've been looking for
a partner to offset their overseas debt.

577
00:34:01,611 --> 00:34:04,030
Of the literally
700 companies considered,

578
00:34:04,114 --> 00:34:07,575
there's only one whose financials
actually made sense,

579
00:34:07,659 --> 00:34:09,160
and that's YellowFin.

580
00:34:09,244 --> 00:34:13,122
Now, how did you know
about this impending marriage?

581
00:34:14,458 --> 00:34:18,170
- l just...
- Kupida said they might get married.

582
00:34:18,254 --> 00:34:22,174
ChemStar.
You said to buy because it was sparkly.

583
00:34:22,675 --> 00:34:23,967
Yes?

584
00:34:24,844 --> 00:34:27,471
- Yeah, okay...
- A data-wire

585
00:34:28,222 --> 00:34:32,726
came in during the meeting.
During the meeting.

586
00:34:33,352 --> 00:34:35,687
"ChemStar finalizes plans to expand

587
00:34:35,772 --> 00:34:38,398
"bauxite excavation
in its New Guinea mine.

588
00:34:38,483 --> 00:34:41,359
"Stock up 18%."

589
00:34:42,028 --> 00:34:43,278
Bauxite.

590
00:34:43,362 --> 00:34:44,654
It's sparkIe gIue.

591
00:34:44,739 --> 00:34:46,073
- Sparkly.
- Sparkly.

592
00:34:47,033 --> 00:34:50,620
NeoDyne. You said to get out.
Do you remember why?

593
00:34:52,039 --> 00:34:53,956
- Do you?
- Yes.

594
00:34:54,041 --> 00:34:55,666
l wrote this down.

595
00:34:57,377 --> 00:35:01,548
"Because their pants
were coming down,

596
00:35:01,633 --> 00:35:03,717
"and everyone was going to see
their underwear,

597
00:35:03,802 --> 00:35:05,761
"which was filled with poop."

598
00:35:06,513 --> 00:35:07,805
Yeah, l remember that.

599
00:35:07,889 --> 00:35:12,142
Lunchtime today, they were exposed
by the SEC for corporate fraud.

600
00:35:12,602 --> 00:35:17,356
Pants pulled down.
And their books? Total poop!

601
00:35:18,526 --> 00:35:20,568
So l'm asking you again.

602
00:35:21,529 --> 00:35:23,404
How did you know all of this?

603
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:30,203
- Are you insider trading?
- No. No, Tom. No way, never.

604
00:35:30,287 --> 00:35:31,788
Then what are you doing?

605
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:36,459
Where are you getting this information?

606
00:35:40,214 --> 00:35:43,133
- So it's the goo-gaa?
- That's how l go there.

607
00:35:43,217 --> 00:35:44,759
What do you mean you go there?
Go where?

608
00:35:44,844 --> 00:35:47,470
- To where the princesses live.
- Right. The princesses.

609
00:35:47,555 --> 00:35:50,307
That's Kupida and Qwali
and all of them, right?

610
00:35:50,392 --> 00:35:51,642
Qwali's a queen.

611
00:35:51,726 --> 00:35:54,103
Kupida, Mopida and Sopida
are princesses.

612
00:35:54,187 --> 00:35:56,438
- Okay, got you.
- How many times do l have to tell you?

613
00:35:56,523 --> 00:35:59,441
Right. Right.
Okay, let me get this right now.

614
00:35:59,526 --> 00:36:02,903
Now, they tell you things
about companies?

615
00:36:07,952 --> 00:36:09,411
Well, you know what,
l got a couple of other companies

616
00:36:09,495 --> 00:36:11,663
l want you to ask them about.
Do you think they'll be up to that?

617
00:36:11,747 --> 00:36:13,248
You can do it yourself.

618
00:36:15,793 --> 00:36:17,669
l can ask them myself.
l can go there with you?

619
00:36:17,753 --> 00:36:19,589
Yes, it'll be fun.

620
00:36:22,551 --> 00:36:23,718
Okay.

621
00:36:26,388 --> 00:36:28,264
A little more room here.

622
00:36:28,348 --> 00:36:29,390
- Now, l do what now?
- Okay.

623
00:36:29,474 --> 00:36:30,808
- l take the goo-gaa.
- You hold it up to your face.

624
00:36:30,893 --> 00:36:34,187
- Hold it up to my face.
- And rub in little circles.

625
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:37,607
- Okay, l'm doing it in little circles. Okay.
- Like this.

626
00:36:37,691 --> 00:36:41,277
Now you put it over your head, like this.

627
00:36:41,361 --> 00:36:42,778
Okay. Now what?

628
00:36:42,863 --> 00:36:47,700
And you kind of call them in your mind
while you spin around in circles.

629
00:36:47,784 --> 00:36:50,621
Okay. So l call to them in my mind
while l spin in a circle.

630
00:36:50,705 --> 00:36:53,790
- Yeah.
- Okay, l'm spinning. l'm spinning.

631
00:36:53,875 --> 00:36:57,336
Keep spinning. Keep spinning.

632
00:37:00,381 --> 00:37:02,549
l'm spinning around.

633
00:37:02,634 --> 00:37:04,968
Are you calling them in your mind?

634
00:37:05,053 --> 00:37:06,470
Yeah.

635
00:37:07,138 --> 00:37:10,015
Okay. So am l supposed to just
keep spinning and spinning around?

636
00:37:10,099 --> 00:37:12,684
'Cause l'm a tad bit nauseous now.

637
00:37:15,146 --> 00:37:17,232
Okay, we're there!

638
00:37:28,536 --> 00:37:30,496
lsn't it beautiful?

639
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,128
Come on, Daddy!
This way, into the forest!

640
00:37:39,381 --> 00:37:42,049
Wow. The princesses
sure live in a beautiful forest.

641
00:37:42,133 --> 00:37:44,760
No, because this part's all burned.

642
00:37:44,844 --> 00:37:47,137
Yes, burned from a big forest fire.

643
00:37:47,222 --> 00:37:50,308
No, Sopida's dragon burnt it all.

644
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:51,935
Sopida has a dragon?

645
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:55,063
And if you want to get past her,
you have to sing a song she likes.

646
00:37:55,147 --> 00:37:57,565
l gotta sing a song
to Sopida's dragon, too?

647
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:01,987
- Hurry. She's coming!
- What? She's coming where?

648
00:38:02,863 --> 00:38:04,114
Sing.

649
00:38:09,453 --> 00:38:13,540
Sopida's dragon, please let me pass

650
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:14,958
Sopida's dragon

651
00:38:15,042 --> 00:38:17,043
You gotta do better than that.

652
00:38:18,212 --> 00:38:24,969
Sopida's dragon, please let me pass

653
00:38:25,053 --> 00:38:26,762
Try higher.

654
00:38:27,598 --> 00:38:30,767
Sopida's dragon, please let...

655
00:38:30,852 --> 00:38:33,562
- Higher, like a mouse!
- You want me to have an aneurysm?

656
00:38:33,646 --> 00:38:37,566
Sopida's dragon, please let me pass

657
00:38:38,985 --> 00:38:40,527
She very hates that.

658
00:38:40,611 --> 00:38:43,488
- l'm with her.
- Try lower, like a frog.

659
00:38:43,573 --> 00:38:45,157
Okay, like a frog.

660
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:49,995
Sopida's dragon, please let me pass

661
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:51,289
Sopida's dragon...

662
00:38:51,373 --> 00:38:54,667
She very likes that. She fell asleep.
Come on. Let's go.

663
00:38:54,752 --> 00:38:57,086
Now we can go through her cave. Duck!

664
00:38:57,171 --> 00:38:59,756
All right, going into the cave.
That's a big, beautiful cave we're in.

665
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,549
No, it's tiny. Can't you see?

666
00:39:01,633 --> 00:39:03,676
Okay. My eyes are just adjusting still.
That's why...

667
00:39:03,761 --> 00:39:04,886
Jump, Daddy! Jump!

668
00:39:04,970 --> 00:39:07,305
- Jump? Why am l jumping? Okay.
- Jump till you get in!

669
00:39:07,389 --> 00:39:08,681
Okay, you're in.

670
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,642
- Now you're out.
- Okay. What was l in?

671
00:39:11,727 --> 00:39:13,936
- France!
- l was in France?

672
00:39:14,438 --> 00:39:16,606
- Now, we're on the beach.
- Okay. We're on the beach now.

673
00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:19,525
All right. Great! ls it a nice beach here?

674
00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:22,196
Only 'cause mermaids give us
popcorn balls.

675
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:26,575
That's so nice.
Thank you for the popcorn balls!

676
00:39:28,703 --> 00:39:32,790
Oh, no! Someone's coming!
Sopida, no! Sopida, you can't!

677
00:39:32,874 --> 00:39:34,208
Can't what? What happened?
What's going on?

678
00:39:34,292 --> 00:39:36,795
She doesn't trust you!
She's throwing rocks at you!

679
00:39:36,879 --> 00:39:38,380
- Why? Why...
- Duck, Daddy! Duck!

680
00:39:38,464 --> 00:39:39,756
l'm ducking! But what did Daddy do?

681
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,716
Why's she throwing rocks at me?
Don't know what l did.

682
00:39:41,801 --> 00:39:43,301
Up the path!

683
00:39:44,136 --> 00:39:45,553
Go back down!

684
00:39:46,889 --> 00:39:48,598
- This way.
- Okay.

685
00:39:49,767 --> 00:39:52,311
Okay, we made it. There they are.

686
00:39:53,647 --> 00:39:55,439
Hi, Kupida! Hi, Mopida!

687
00:39:55,524 --> 00:39:57,942
- Hey.
- Say something nice.

688
00:39:58,026 --> 00:40:02,113
Hey, Kupida and Mopida, how are you?
Good to see you.

689
00:40:03,824 --> 00:40:07,076
My name is Evan Danielson,
and l'm Olivia's dad.

690
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:09,620
They already know who you are.

691
00:40:09,704 --> 00:40:11,038
Okay.

692
00:40:12,833 --> 00:40:14,875
lt's good to see you.
You look so nice and pretty,

693
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:18,671
the two of you.
My, you really outdid yourself today.

694
00:40:18,755 --> 00:40:22,175
l'm here to ask you. l was wondering...

695
00:40:23,970 --> 00:40:26,847
- Are you sure they're...
- Yeah. They're watching.

696
00:40:28,266 --> 00:40:30,517
l was gonna... l have some...

697
00:40:32,770 --> 00:40:36,940
l want to ask about magnesium futures

698
00:40:37,024 --> 00:40:40,902
and their relationship to
Bolivian currency fluctuations.

699
00:40:44,532 --> 00:40:47,160
Specifically, these three companies,

700
00:40:47,244 --> 00:40:51,622
La Paz Ore and lron,
and lnternational Mining

701
00:40:51,707 --> 00:40:54,710
and Weston Metallurgy Limited.

702
00:40:55,253 --> 00:40:57,045
Weston Metallurgy.

703
00:40:57,839 --> 00:41:01,633
These three. l was wondering if you...
Can they see them?

704
00:41:03,678 --> 00:41:05,345
l don't want to be in your way.

705
00:41:06,764 --> 00:41:07,973
Okay, what are they doing?
Are they talking?

706
00:41:08,057 --> 00:41:09,141
- Yeah.
- What are they talking about?

707
00:41:09,225 --> 00:41:10,559
They're talking.

708
00:41:16,649 --> 00:41:17,816
Really?

709
00:41:18,568 --> 00:41:20,235
Are you sure?

710
00:41:21,029 --> 00:41:22,196
Okay.

711
00:41:23,115 --> 00:41:24,949
Yes, no, no.

712
00:41:26,702 --> 00:41:27,744
Did they give a reason?

713
00:41:29,330 --> 00:41:33,625
- Because it's fancy?
- That's exactly right, sir. Fancy.

714
00:41:33,709 --> 00:41:36,544
But you're also saying, and this is what
strikes me as contradictory,

715
00:41:36,629 --> 00:41:39,172
that we should abandon all interests
in Weston Metallurgy.

716
00:41:39,256 --> 00:41:42,217
- That's correct.
- Because the boliviano is going to...

717
00:41:42,301 --> 00:41:43,510
What did he say again?

718
00:41:43,594 --> 00:41:46,513
"Be a big, dumb showoff
and fall off its bike."

719
00:41:46,597 --> 00:41:50,099
No. Trike.
And nobody likes a big, dumb showoff.

720
00:41:50,184 --> 00:41:52,185
Well, no offense, son,
but sounds to me like

721
00:41:52,269 --> 00:41:54,355
a load of what you just stepped in.

722
00:41:54,439 --> 00:41:57,025
Well, that's why we brought
Mr. Whitefeather along, right?

723
00:41:57,109 --> 00:41:58,109
What you got, son?

724
00:41:58,194 --> 00:42:00,695
Mr. Rowe, that's funny.

725
00:42:01,447 --> 00:42:06,076
The country's entire monetary system
reduced to riding around on a tricycle.

726
00:42:07,370 --> 00:42:11,206
That's a laugh. lt's good to laugh.
lt's good to laugh, man.

727
00:42:12,166 --> 00:42:14,751
But there's a time to be serious.

728
00:42:14,835 --> 00:42:18,588
We're out here in these holy mountains
that we call Rocky.

729
00:42:19,215 --> 00:42:22,133
They're full of predator, prey.

730
00:42:23,512 --> 00:42:27,139
The lion of the mountain
knows when to pounce.

731
00:42:29,268 --> 00:42:31,394
Better watch out, jack-bunny...

732
00:42:31,478 --> 00:42:34,230
- Excuse me, one moment.
- Yeah, okay.

733
00:42:40,904 --> 00:42:42,697
Love the new act, man.

734
00:42:42,781 --> 00:42:44,865
- Fun character.
- Thank you.

735
00:42:45,826 --> 00:42:47,159
You know, there's an old tribal saying,

736
00:42:47,244 --> 00:42:50,079
"lt's not the paint
that makes the warrior."

737
00:42:50,163 --> 00:42:53,541
- What?
- Be well, brother. Be well.

738
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:57,879
Evan, l ever tell you
about Billy Littlesnake,

739
00:42:57,964 --> 00:43:00,090
a guy l used to go fishing with
in Montana?

740
00:43:00,174 --> 00:43:02,884
l think you spared me that story.

741
00:43:02,969 --> 00:43:04,845
He'd go fishing
where nobody else fished

742
00:43:04,929 --> 00:43:07,765
and always come back with 10 fat trout.

743
00:43:07,850 --> 00:43:10,685
Turned out he was stopping off
at the market and buying them.

744
00:43:10,769 --> 00:43:12,687
l'm not insider trading,
if that's what you're saying.

745
00:43:12,771 --> 00:43:16,274
Whoa, come on. Let's don't go into
those woods. All right?

746
00:43:16,358 --> 00:43:19,736
- There's a lot of bear in those woods.
- Hey, listen. Stop that thing.

747
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:22,196
lf you're going to talk to me,
don't do that thing you do.

748
00:43:22,281 --> 00:43:24,491
You want me to speak directly?
l can do that.

749
00:43:24,576 --> 00:43:25,909
Then do it.

750
00:43:27,162 --> 00:43:29,371
You want to run with me, Evan,
then run with me.

751
00:43:29,456 --> 00:43:32,207
l accept the challenge. l welcome it.

752
00:43:32,292 --> 00:43:36,962
But if l find out that you're stopping off
at the market and buying your fat trout,

753
00:43:37,047 --> 00:43:38,172
l'm gonna scalp you.

754
00:43:38,256 --> 00:43:40,507
You're gonna scalp me. Literally?

755
00:43:40,592 --> 00:43:42,718
lt's gonna feel literal, yeah.

756
00:43:43,595 --> 00:43:45,554
Nice chatting with you, Johnny.

757
00:43:47,390 --> 00:43:48,766
And you, Evan.

758
00:43:48,850 --> 00:43:51,602
Hey, Ev, good to see you. Okay.

759
00:43:53,313 --> 00:43:55,523
Let me tell you something
about Johnny Whitefeather.

760
00:43:55,608 --> 00:43:58,777
Under all the show,
l'm good at what l do.

761
00:43:59,362 --> 00:44:01,071
l have a gift. l see trends.

762
00:44:01,155 --> 00:44:04,658
l see patterns.
l see things no one else will ever see.

763
00:44:04,742 --> 00:44:07,619
Evan is good, but he's not that good.

764
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:10,413
l want you to find out
where he's getting his information.

765
00:44:10,915 --> 00:44:17,797
Sopida's dragon, please let me pass

766
00:44:17,881 --> 00:44:19,548
- She's in a good mood tonight.
- That's great.

767
00:44:19,633 --> 00:44:22,093
We're all in a good mood.
Let's go through the cave then!

768
00:44:22,177 --> 00:44:23,219
Let's get in the cave,
going through the cave.

769
00:44:23,303 --> 00:44:24,846
Ducking down!
lt's a little above my head in the cave.

770
00:44:24,931 --> 00:44:27,891
And now we're coming out in France.
We're in France!

771
00:44:29,352 --> 00:44:31,103
All right.
And now we're back on the beach again.

772
00:44:31,187 --> 00:44:33,313
On the wonderful beach
with Kupida and Mopida.

773
00:44:33,398 --> 00:44:36,149
Hello, Kupida and Mopida!
How are the princesses today?

774
00:44:36,234 --> 00:44:38,568
- They're good.
- They're good. That's great.

775
00:44:38,653 --> 00:44:40,195
That's great.
Hold on to this for a second, honey.

776
00:44:40,279 --> 00:44:41,279
- Yeah.
- Okay, now.

777
00:44:41,364 --> 00:44:42,948
Ladies, l want to talk to you
about something.

778
00:44:43,032 --> 00:44:46,034
First, let me tell you that those gowns
you're wearing look exquisite.

779
00:44:46,119 --> 00:44:47,786
They look exquisite, ladies.

780
00:44:49,747 --> 00:44:52,666
l'll just go right out and say it.
Am l looking in the right direction here?

781
00:44:52,750 --> 00:44:54,042
- Yeah.
- Okay.

782
00:44:54,127 --> 00:44:57,714
l have a potential client
who is in the medical field

783
00:44:57,798 --> 00:44:58,881
and he has a particular company.

784
00:44:58,966 --> 00:45:00,800
He was wondering if
he should hold on to that company.

785
00:45:00,884 --> 00:45:03,553
And l was wondering if you ladies
had any feelings about that.

786
00:45:03,637 --> 00:45:06,639
The company is called VallaTech.

787
00:45:06,724 --> 00:45:09,058
l've just been hearing
so many incredible things about it.

788
00:45:09,143 --> 00:45:11,811
We were just wondering
what you princesses thought.

789
00:45:13,605 --> 00:45:16,023
- What do they think?
- Maybe.

790
00:45:18,485 --> 00:45:19,736
Maybe?

791
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:25,241
Because Kupida very liked it,
and Mopida very hated it.

792
00:45:25,325 --> 00:45:26,703
Okay, so, now what do we do?

793
00:45:26,787 --> 00:45:32,000
lf they disagree, we have to see Qwali,
but she's at her mountain castle.

794
00:45:34,295 --> 00:45:36,129
Okay. Well,
where's the mountain castle?

795
00:45:36,672 --> 00:45:38,006
There.

796
00:45:40,843 --> 00:45:44,429
Now, does Qwali have to be out
by this bridge in front of my building,

797
00:45:44,513 --> 00:45:46,556
all these people all over the place,
where everybody can see us?

798
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:48,099
We are not by a bridge.

799
00:45:48,184 --> 00:45:49,893
We're at the bottom of
Qwali's mountain!

800
00:45:49,977 --> 00:45:52,103
And there's no one here
except you and me,

801
00:45:52,188 --> 00:45:55,231
and maybe Qwali,
if she likes the way you dance.

802
00:45:55,316 --> 00:45:57,151
Dance? l have to dance for Qwali, too?

803
00:45:57,235 --> 00:46:01,280
Yeah. Because there's a ball tonight,
and she has to see who is the best king.

804
00:46:01,364 --> 00:46:03,949
And she will not talk until she does.

805
00:46:05,702 --> 00:46:09,955
Okay. Well, let's do a little dance
for Qwali, then.

806
00:46:12,250 --> 00:46:13,834
- Hey, Evan.
- Hey, what's going on, man?

807
00:46:13,919 --> 00:46:15,044
How are you...

808
00:46:18,799 --> 00:46:20,841
- Okay. How's that?
- Horrible.

809
00:46:20,926 --> 00:46:24,011
You have to get on that thing,
so she can see you.

810
00:46:24,095 --> 00:46:26,640
Hey, look. l'm not getting up
on the stage, all right?

811
00:46:26,724 --> 00:46:28,350
She won't talk to you.

812
00:46:28,434 --> 00:46:30,560
Okay, l'm gonna go get up on the stage.

813
00:46:41,865 --> 00:46:45,284
Oh, come on! She can't see that!
She's way, way up there.

814
00:46:45,369 --> 00:46:48,287
Hey, all right, okay. Take it easy here.

815
00:46:53,293 --> 00:46:54,877
More! Bigger!

816
00:46:56,756 --> 00:46:58,632
Like that? Like this? No? Yes?

817
00:46:58,716 --> 00:47:01,510
To the beat! Can't you hear the music?

818
00:47:01,594 --> 00:47:03,637
To the beat? l don't hear the beat.

819
00:47:03,721 --> 00:47:04,763
Check it out.

820
00:47:05,765 --> 00:47:07,599
l hear the snickers.

821
00:47:09,394 --> 00:47:11,270
lt's spinning music!

822
00:47:12,272 --> 00:47:15,732
- Spinning, with your arms out!
- You mean like a waltz?

823
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:20,112
Like a waltz you're talking about. Okay.

824
00:47:53,064 --> 00:47:55,983
- That's the best l could do.
- No, it was good. She liked it.

825
00:47:56,067 --> 00:47:58,403
You can go to the ball!

826
00:47:58,487 --> 00:48:00,322
Okay, all right.

827
00:48:00,406 --> 00:48:02,991
Qwali said it was good.
l can go to the ball.

828
00:48:04,327 --> 00:48:08,163
Now, did you ask Qwali
how she feels about VallaTech?

829
00:48:10,458 --> 00:48:12,459
Bottom line, sir,
is that VallaTech is stuck up

830
00:48:12,543 --> 00:48:14,502
and doesn't play nice with others.
l say we cut it out.

831
00:48:14,587 --> 00:48:15,670
- Really?
- Yeah.

832
00:48:15,755 --> 00:48:17,213
l know this sounds a little unorthodox,

833
00:48:17,298 --> 00:48:18,590
but here's something else
you need to know.

834
00:48:18,674 --> 00:48:20,842
lt has a big butt?

835
00:48:20,927 --> 00:48:23,178
A big ol' butt with a shelf on it.

836
00:48:23,262 --> 00:48:26,681
l think if you look at DarbaCon's
bloated end-of-the-year rollover...

837
00:48:26,766 --> 00:48:29,268
...you'll see it has pretty hair
and all the boys are looking at it.

838
00:48:29,353 --> 00:48:32,355
Well, if he said it wets the bed,
then it wets the bed.

839
00:48:34,024 --> 00:48:35,274
What else did he say?

840
00:48:35,359 --> 00:48:38,527
This little company goes
wee-wee-wee-wee all the way home.

841
00:48:38,612 --> 00:48:42,657
- Did you say, "Wee-wee-wee-wee"?
- Yes. All the way home.

842
00:48:42,741 --> 00:48:44,867
- And people are buying that?
- By the millions.

843
00:48:44,952 --> 00:48:47,703
lcky, icky, icky. Gross. Yucky.

844
00:48:47,788 --> 00:48:50,414
Rose, is Evan seeing a psychic?

845
00:48:51,208 --> 00:48:52,249
Not that l'm aware of.

846
00:48:52,334 --> 00:48:53,918
lt's fizzy like a soda pop.

847
00:48:54,002 --> 00:48:56,546
- ls he a psychic?
- No, l don't believe he is.

848
00:48:56,798 --> 00:48:58,675
lt's old enough to start wearing makeup.

849
00:48:58,759 --> 00:49:01,135
"Ready for makeup." You feeling this?

850
00:49:01,220 --> 00:49:04,764
He says your funds are mature,
and now it's time to start diversifying.

851
00:49:04,848 --> 00:49:08,142
Specifically, for A.l.,
what l'm thinking is Argenteeny Pinkini.

852
00:49:08,227 --> 00:49:10,144
- l'm feeling that.
- Hey, l want some of that.

853
00:49:10,229 --> 00:49:11,312
Back off, dawg. lt's mine.

854
00:49:11,397 --> 00:49:14,524
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! There's enough
lip gloss to go around for everybody.

855
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:19,612
Agroco is a crybaby who always
goes running to Mommy.

856
00:49:19,697 --> 00:49:21,572
- That's your analysis.
- Yes, it is.

857
00:49:21,657 --> 00:49:23,992
- And you recommend l...
- Sell.

858
00:49:24,076 --> 00:49:26,452
- Sell the crybaby.
- Sell the crybaby.

859
00:49:26,537 --> 00:49:27,996
ls this some kind ofjoke, Tom?

860
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:30,457
- No, Carl. lt's not.
- Because it seems...

861
00:49:30,542 --> 00:49:32,710
- l know, a little different.
- A little?

862
00:49:32,794 --> 00:49:35,087
Why don't we hear
what Mr. Whitefeather has to say?

863
00:49:35,171 --> 00:49:36,797
Yes. Johnny, would you like to

864
00:49:36,881 --> 00:49:41,385
toss some spear at some tatonka,
or cast some venison into the potlatch?

865
00:49:42,012 --> 00:49:45,097
No, l wouldn't.
l'd like to take this seriously.

866
00:49:45,181 --> 00:49:47,433
There's a great deal of money
at stake here, Mr. Simons.

867
00:49:47,517 --> 00:49:50,811
l think that you should move forward
on Agroco, aggressively.

868
00:49:50,895 --> 00:49:52,521
lncrease your holdings.

869
00:49:52,605 --> 00:49:54,648
And a gentleman
by the name of Dante D'Enzo

870
00:49:54,733 --> 00:50:00,113
happens to concur with my position.
His company, D.D.E. lnvestments,

871
00:50:00,197 --> 00:50:04,075
is looking to increase
their holdings by 25%.

872
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:08,664
So l think if we're going to make a move,
we have to do it rather quickly.

873
00:50:08,749 --> 00:50:11,292
lf you're ready, l'm ready.
Let's make some money.

874
00:50:13,045 --> 00:50:15,129
That's my "venison."

875
00:50:16,465 --> 00:50:18,340
Evan? Your thoughts?

876
00:50:22,137 --> 00:50:26,140
Well, l think that's interesting.
l think that's very interesting.

877
00:50:26,224 --> 00:50:28,601
Very, very, very interesting

878
00:50:29,228 --> 00:50:31,897
that Dante D'Enzo would say in
and l would say out.

879
00:50:31,981 --> 00:50:33,774
That's interesting, l think.

880
00:50:35,151 --> 00:50:36,735
What l'm going to do now
is l'm gonna go to the restroom,

881
00:50:36,819 --> 00:50:39,196
and l'm gonna think this through,
and l'm gonna re-crunch some numbers

882
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:41,323
and get right back to you, gentlemen.
Excuse me.

883
00:50:42,533 --> 00:50:43,617
So...

884
00:50:54,796 --> 00:50:56,421
These look great.

885
00:50:56,506 --> 00:50:58,006
Evan?

886
00:50:58,091 --> 00:51:03,137
- Hey. Hey. What are you doing here?
- Flyers for Saturday. The Fall Sing.

887
00:51:03,222 --> 00:51:04,847
We're on lunch,
so l'm just dropping them off.

888
00:51:04,932 --> 00:51:07,308
- Hey, how you doing? l'm Rick.
- Rick.

889
00:51:07,392 --> 00:51:09,185
Rick's son, Henry, is in kindergarten.

890
00:51:09,269 --> 00:51:12,438
Yeah, so you're Rick.
You're the sculpture, sculptor.

891
00:51:12,523 --> 00:51:15,359
l saw your little thing that you did
at the Comerica building.

892
00:51:15,443 --> 00:51:17,611
- Yeah.
- Very metallic and pointy.

893
00:51:17,695 --> 00:51:19,113
And unfairly criticized, l might add.

894
00:51:19,197 --> 00:51:21,573
Look, l got some last-minute
parenting thing l gotta do with Olivia.

895
00:51:21,658 --> 00:51:23,742
Nice meeting you, Rick.

896
00:51:23,827 --> 00:51:25,702
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Sorry to interrupt. lt's Mr. Danielson.

897
00:51:25,787 --> 00:51:26,870
- Can l talk to Olivia for one second?
- Sure.

898
00:51:26,955 --> 00:51:28,664
l'll be brief. Olivia,
come talk to Daddy, please?

899
00:51:28,748 --> 00:51:29,791
Hi, everybody.

900
00:51:29,875 --> 00:51:33,044
l have some quick questions for Qwali
about Agroco. Where should we go?

901
00:51:33,420 --> 00:51:34,504
Come on. Come on. Come on.

902
00:51:34,588 --> 00:51:37,298
Okay. Did you bring the goo-gaa?
All right. Okay.

903
00:51:37,383 --> 00:51:41,261
l knew you would. Okay, perfect, perfect,
perfect. Blanket up. Rub in fast circles.

904
00:51:41,345 --> 00:51:44,639
l smell something burning.
lt's Sopida's dragon! Here she is!

905
00:51:44,723 --> 00:51:47,475
Mopida and Kupida! Good to see you!
Time to dance!

906
00:51:58,362 --> 00:52:00,364
- That's it.
- What are they doing?

907
00:52:00,448 --> 00:52:02,616
l have no idea.

908
00:52:02,701 --> 00:52:06,203
- She's really sure?
- And she says you agree with her.

909
00:52:06,288 --> 00:52:08,122
- l do?
- Don't you?

910
00:52:10,375 --> 00:52:12,543
- Yeah, l guess l do, sort of.
- Okay.

911
00:52:12,627 --> 00:52:14,003
Okay, give me a high five.

912
00:52:14,087 --> 00:52:15,171
- Wish me luck.
- Good luck.

913
00:52:15,255 --> 00:52:17,506
Put this back in. All right, tell no one!

914
00:52:20,093 --> 00:52:24,723
So you're saying that Dante D'Enzo
is totally wrong on this.

915
00:52:24,807 --> 00:52:25,849
Yes.

916
00:52:25,933 --> 00:52:28,226
And your inner child says that

917
00:52:28,311 --> 00:52:31,522
we should completely
pull out ofAgroco.

918
00:52:31,607 --> 00:52:33,357
Yes.

919
00:52:33,442 --> 00:52:37,403
Okay. l think l'm going to go with

920
00:52:37,487 --> 00:52:40,198
what Mr. Whitefeather
has put together here.

921
00:52:40,282 --> 00:52:42,950
lt seems better.

922
00:52:44,328 --> 00:52:48,372
- l am going to have the venison.
- lt's a savory meat.

923
00:52:52,628 --> 00:52:53,878
Doctor's office.

924
00:52:53,962 --> 00:52:57,673
l know you say Qwali's never wrong,
but l think we both were this time.

925
00:52:57,758 --> 00:53:01,803
lfjust Mopida says it
orjust Kupida says it,

926
00:53:01,888 --> 00:53:07,392
it could be wrong.
But if Qwali says it, it's never wrong.

927
00:53:07,977 --> 00:53:10,896
Well, l think
she kind of was wrong this time.

928
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:13,190
- She was not.
- Yes, she was.

929
00:53:13,274 --> 00:53:14,691
- Was not.
- Yes, she was.

930
00:53:14,776 --> 00:53:16,193
Not.

931
00:53:17,654 --> 00:53:19,071
Actually, not.

932
00:53:19,155 --> 00:53:21,698
Ha, ha, you're just trying to get me
to say "was."

933
00:53:21,783 --> 00:53:23,909
No, she really wasn't wrong.

934
00:53:23,993 --> 00:53:26,370
D'Enzo pulled out ofAgroco,
which is down 12%.

935
00:53:26,454 --> 00:53:28,956
"Agroco cries foul,
hides behind parent company."

936
00:53:31,669 --> 00:53:33,586
Crybaby runs to Mommy.

937
00:53:39,511 --> 00:53:41,387
- How are you doing this?
- lt's easy.

938
00:53:41,471 --> 00:53:43,847
You just overlap them
and it makes a pyramid.

939
00:53:45,684 --> 00:53:49,853
Olivia? We're ready for you, sweetie.
Time for your shot.

940
00:53:53,525 --> 00:53:56,068
You did a really good job in there.
l'm really proud of you.

941
00:53:56,152 --> 00:53:58,696
For that, we're gonna get
a special ice cream treat.

942
00:53:58,780 --> 00:54:01,240
- l cried, though.
- But you did good.

943
00:54:01,325 --> 00:54:02,867
You see, when l was your age
l had to get a shot,

944
00:54:02,952 --> 00:54:05,912
l was running, screaming,
"Don't stab me! Don't stab me!"

945
00:54:05,997 --> 00:54:07,580
No, you wouldn't.

946
00:54:07,665 --> 00:54:09,958
"Don't kill me! Don't kill me, please!"

947
00:54:10,334 --> 00:54:12,168
How you doing, sir? What can l get you?

948
00:54:12,253 --> 00:54:14,045
Can we get two juice bars?

949
00:54:16,716 --> 00:54:19,843
- So, who wants pancakes for dinner?
- l do.

950
00:54:28,602 --> 00:54:30,312
Yeah, that's what l say.

951
00:54:42,075 --> 00:54:43,492
No, we're not going to pour it yet.

952
00:54:43,577 --> 00:54:46,038
Put butter on it.
Gotta put a small amount of butter.

953
00:54:49,208 --> 00:54:51,835
- You put too much butter.
- No, that's enough.

954
00:55:02,639 --> 00:55:04,557
Looks like Sopida's dragon
got to this one.

955
00:55:04,641 --> 00:55:07,143
- Hey!
- That's gonna be your stack.

956
00:55:07,227 --> 00:55:10,438
You keep going here
and l'll go set up the restaurant.

957
00:55:10,522 --> 00:55:12,440
The restaurant? What restaurant?

958
00:55:14,568 --> 00:55:17,945
- Allow me to tell you the specials.
- Please do.

959
00:55:18,030 --> 00:55:19,530
Pancakes.

960
00:55:19,615 --> 00:55:25,453
We have kind of burnt pancakes
and really burnt pancakes.

961
00:55:25,537 --> 00:55:27,205
Okay, well, how much for the regular?

962
00:55:27,956 --> 00:55:32,085
- Let me see. $3,000.
- And how much for the kind of burnt?

963
00:55:32,545 --> 00:55:34,588
- Forty-seven cents.
- Okay, let me have the kind of burnts.

964
00:55:34,672 --> 00:55:36,382
Let me have two kind of burnts, please.

965
00:55:36,466 --> 00:55:39,093
Perfect. Now do we have
any condiments or anything like...

966
00:55:39,177 --> 00:55:40,302
What do you mean by that?

967
00:55:40,387 --> 00:55:44,348
You know, like syrup or some honey
or some jelly or some...

968
00:55:44,432 --> 00:55:48,310
Anything that might cut the taste a bit.

969
00:55:53,734 --> 00:55:55,068
Ketchup.

970
00:55:56,529 --> 00:56:01,991
Chocolate syrup. Hot sauce.
And mustard.

971
00:56:02,076 --> 00:56:05,579
You know, l would have just went with
chocolate sauce or honey or...

972
00:56:05,664 --> 00:56:08,958
- Don't worry, it's yummier this way.
- But ketchup is...

973
00:56:09,042 --> 00:56:11,544
Wow. That's enough ketchup.

974
00:56:12,838 --> 00:56:17,925
- Now would you like chocolate sauce?
- Well, l guess so, yeah.

975
00:56:18,009 --> 00:56:21,095
- You probably would prefer it.
- Yeah, wow.

976
00:56:21,179 --> 00:56:23,180
Yeah, let's put a lot on.

977
00:56:24,516 --> 00:56:25,975
Mustard.

978
00:56:26,059 --> 00:56:29,770
Excellent choice.
Brown and yellow match perfectly.

979
00:56:29,855 --> 00:56:32,940
l think it's gonna add
some mystery to the dish.

980
00:56:33,024 --> 00:56:36,027
Don't eat it yet. We got the hot sauce.

981
00:56:38,030 --> 00:56:41,199
Hey, where...
What happened to the pancakes?

982
00:56:42,493 --> 00:56:44,578
There. Perfect.

983
00:56:44,662 --> 00:56:46,705
l think we should say our grace and eat.

984
00:56:46,789 --> 00:56:48,039
- Okay.
- Okay.

985
00:56:48,875 --> 00:56:51,084
- So, you pray with Daddy now.
- Okay.

986
00:56:51,169 --> 00:56:53,295
- Dear Lord.
- Dear Lord.

987
00:56:53,379 --> 00:56:56,798
- Please protect my daddy's throat.
- Please protect my daddy's throat.

988
00:56:56,883 --> 00:57:02,012
- He never done nothing to nobody, Lord.
- He never done nothing to nobody, Lord.

989
00:57:02,096 --> 00:57:03,557
- Amen.
- Amen.

990
00:57:03,641 --> 00:57:06,643
- And now l'm going to dig in.
- Yeah, dig in.

991
00:57:08,730 --> 00:57:12,316
And l think it's time
to ingest this pancake and be a good...

992
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:14,234
Hey, look, it's Sopida.

993
00:57:15,737 --> 00:57:17,446
She's gone.

994
00:57:18,823 --> 00:57:21,200
That's the best pancake
l ever had in my life!

995
00:57:21,284 --> 00:57:24,745
- Can l please see the bill?
- Yeah, the bill?

996
00:57:25,497 --> 00:57:28,081
$400,000?
You must be out your mind, woman!

997
00:57:28,166 --> 00:57:30,542
You trying to get... Tell you what!
Come back here now! Come back here!

998
00:57:30,710 --> 00:57:32,711
Almost got you! Oh, my God!

999
00:57:33,588 --> 00:57:34,672
Yeah, that's a good one, too.

1000
00:57:34,757 --> 00:57:36,591
Hold on, wait, wait, wait,
don't hog the picture now.

1001
00:57:36,675 --> 00:57:37,884
You're gonna hog the picture.

1002
00:57:37,968 --> 00:57:41,387
Wait, the picture's not right
unless Daddy's in the picture.

1003
00:57:41,472 --> 00:57:44,682
That's magic! Come on, it's late.
Okay, come on.

1004
00:57:46,393 --> 00:57:47,769
Daddy?

1005
00:57:48,812 --> 00:57:51,648
l'm scared about
the Fall Sing on Saturday.

1006
00:57:51,732 --> 00:57:54,108
What are you afraid of? Your mother
told me you were excited about it.

1007
00:57:54,193 --> 00:57:58,446
Well, everybody has a solo
and mine is on the last song.

1008
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:03,993
And l start it, so if l mess up,
the whole entire song is wrecked.

1009
00:58:04,078 --> 00:58:05,871
What makes you think
you're gonna mess up?

1010
00:58:05,956 --> 00:58:07,039
l can't sing.

1011
00:58:07,123 --> 00:58:09,124
- What do you mean you can't sing?
- l can't.

1012
00:58:09,209 --> 00:58:11,961
Yes, you can.
Where's the song you're gonna sing?

1013
00:58:12,045 --> 00:58:13,838
Let me see.

1014
00:58:13,923 --> 00:58:15,715
l'll put it to the right page.

1015
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:17,050
- What song is it?
- Here, this page.

1016
00:58:17,134 --> 00:58:18,677
All right, All You Need ls Love.

1017
00:58:18,761 --> 00:58:20,178
Okay, that's a good one.
That's The Beatles.

1018
00:58:20,263 --> 00:58:21,346
Tell you what, here's what you do.

1019
00:58:21,430 --> 00:58:23,640
Come over here.
l'm going to get you onstage here.

1020
00:58:23,724 --> 00:58:25,225
- This is the stage.
- l thought you'd play the part.

1021
00:58:25,309 --> 00:58:27,227
No, you're gonna get on stage
and l'm gonna be in the audience.

1022
00:58:27,311 --> 00:58:29,062
This is going to be
just like you're at the play.

1023
00:58:29,146 --> 00:58:31,064
And all the people in the audience
all came to see the show.

1024
00:58:31,148 --> 00:58:33,275
We're all like, "This is great.
Well, l can't wait to see the show.

1025
00:58:33,359 --> 00:58:35,903
"Who's in the show? Well, who's that?
l wonder if she can sing."

1026
00:58:35,988 --> 00:58:37,572
You've got to get ready now.
You got to get ready,

1027
00:58:37,656 --> 00:58:39,407
see, 'cause everybody's watching,
everybody's watching.

1028
00:58:39,491 --> 00:58:40,908
And you're going to say...

1029
00:58:40,993 --> 00:58:43,244
There's nothing you can do
that can't be done

1030
00:58:43,328 --> 00:58:44,912
- l can't.
- Yes, you can!

1031
00:58:44,997 --> 00:58:48,916
There's nothing you can do
that can't be done

1032
00:58:49,001 --> 00:58:50,084
Here's how you're singing it.

1033
00:58:50,168 --> 00:58:52,628
You say it and then you take
the last word and just stretch it out.

1034
00:58:52,713 --> 00:59:05,309
There's nothing you can do
that can't be done

1035
00:59:05,393 --> 00:59:06,977
All right, now, here's the second line.

1036
00:59:07,061 --> 00:59:12,024
There's nothing you can sing
that can't be sung

1037
00:59:12,108 --> 00:59:13,275
And we go higher now.

1038
00:59:13,359 --> 00:59:17,487
There's nothing you can sing
that can't be sung

1039
00:59:17,572 --> 00:59:19,072
A little higher though. Higher. Higher.

1040
00:59:19,157 --> 00:59:21,992
There's nothing you can sing
that can't be sung

1041
00:59:22,076 --> 00:59:24,287
My baby sounds like Minnie Riperton!

1042
00:59:24,371 --> 00:59:26,080
Okay, let's drop it lower.
Let's do it like a frog.

1043
00:59:26,165 --> 00:59:27,999
There's nothing you can sing
that can't be sung

1044
00:59:28,083 --> 00:59:30,585
Daddy, you're just doing
what l did to you.

1045
00:59:30,669 --> 00:59:33,046
Yeah, that's right. l'm doing
what you did to me. Now let's try it.

1046
00:59:33,130 --> 00:59:37,301
There's nothing you can sing
that can't be sung

1047
00:59:37,385 --> 00:59:39,386
See, you're doing it.
Okay, here's the next one.

1048
00:59:39,471 --> 00:59:40,512
There's nothing you can say

1049
00:59:40,597 --> 00:59:43,724
But you can Iearn how to pIay the game
It's easy

1050
00:59:43,808 --> 00:59:46,769
There's nothing you can say
But you can Iearn how to pIay the game

1051
00:59:46,853 --> 00:59:54,151
It's easy

1052
00:59:54,235 --> 00:59:56,570
That's it! That's it! You're singing!

1053
00:59:57,739 --> 01:00:01,575
Take a bow! She was wonderful!

1054
01:00:01,910 --> 01:00:04,161
- You're going to the top!
- Oh, stop.

1055
01:00:04,245 --> 01:00:07,040
She's going to the top!

1056
01:00:09,752 --> 01:00:12,128
"They finish reading. Olivia's mother
gives her a kiss and says,

1057
01:00:12,213 --> 01:00:16,508
"'You know, you really wear me out,
but l love you anyway.'

1058
01:00:16,592 --> 01:00:20,679
"Olivia gives her a kiss back and says,
'l love you anyway, too."'

1059
01:00:23,015 --> 01:00:24,724
There you go, sleepyhead.

1060
01:00:29,105 --> 01:00:30,188
Hey!

1061
01:00:31,482 --> 01:00:34,443
We didn't talk to the princesses tonight.

1062
01:00:35,988 --> 01:00:38,031
Yeah, you know what, we didn't,
but that's okay.

1063
01:00:38,116 --> 01:00:39,199
lt's quite all right.

1064
01:00:39,283 --> 01:00:43,370
Well, maybe if you want,
you can talk to them yourself.

1065
01:00:44,038 --> 01:00:45,789
Really? On my own?

1066
01:00:46,082 --> 01:00:48,750
Qwali says she trusts you now.

1067
01:00:51,629 --> 01:00:53,213
That's very nice of Qwali.

1068
01:00:53,297 --> 01:00:56,258
Tell Qwali thanks a lot.
That means a lot to me.

1069
01:00:56,342 --> 01:00:58,802
Or l could tell her myself.

1070
01:00:58,886 --> 01:00:59,970
You want me to?

1071
01:01:04,183 --> 01:01:05,642
Hey, you want me to?

1072
01:01:07,938 --> 01:01:09,897
Did you fall asleep that quick?

1073
01:01:42,182 --> 01:01:43,975
l send you out to gather
pertinent information.

1074
01:01:44,059 --> 01:01:45,143
You come back with this.

1075
01:01:45,227 --> 01:01:48,104
But this is all he does.
He just hangs out with his daughter.

1076
01:01:48,189 --> 01:01:50,523
They sing and they dance
and they laugh.

1077
01:01:52,359 --> 01:01:54,444
They're playing with a blanket.

1078
01:01:54,528 --> 01:01:56,863
The two of them with their faces buried

1079
01:01:59,074 --> 01:02:00,408
in a blanket.

1080
01:02:03,871 --> 01:02:05,205
The blanket.

1081
01:02:07,459 --> 01:02:11,128
- It's a wakaIyapi.
- Yeah.

1082
01:02:13,173 --> 01:02:16,634
He's a sharp cat. He is a razor cat!

1083
01:02:17,427 --> 01:02:19,845
- Say that again?
- WakaIyapi.

1084
01:02:19,930 --> 01:02:22,598
A tapestry. A weave.

1085
01:02:23,558 --> 01:02:25,851
lt's how you access a higher eye.

1086
01:02:26,394 --> 01:02:29,939
My people believe it's the way
to achieve closeness to the Great Spirit.

1087
01:02:30,023 --> 01:02:32,983
- Who are you calling?
- You'll see.

1088
01:02:33,443 --> 01:02:36,237
The entire Denver financial community
is talking about you.

1089
01:02:36,321 --> 01:02:38,281
But as your very first client ever,

1090
01:02:38,366 --> 01:02:41,159
you owe it to me to tell me
what the hell is going on.

1091
01:02:41,244 --> 01:02:42,953
l told you, Maggie, l'm just listening.

1092
01:02:43,037 --> 01:02:46,414
To the little voice that whispers to you.
Yeah, right.

1093
01:02:46,499 --> 01:02:48,583
Why don't you just tell her your secret?

1094
01:02:50,753 --> 01:02:54,257
- Hi. Johnny Whitefeather.
- l'm Margaret Johnson.

1095
01:02:54,341 --> 01:02:57,510
Evan? Tell her the truth.

1096
01:03:03,976 --> 01:03:06,477
Okay, Maggie, here's the truth.
l have a six-year-old daughter.

1097
01:03:06,562 --> 01:03:09,439
Now, she has what you would
have to call a magic blanket.

1098
01:03:09,524 --> 01:03:11,441
Now, with this blanket,
l can be taken and be transported

1099
01:03:11,526 --> 01:03:13,026
to a mystical, magical place

1100
01:03:13,111 --> 01:03:16,280
where l meet with three
invisible princesses and one queen.

1101
01:03:16,364 --> 01:03:19,324
lncidentally, they all have
remarkable insight to investing,

1102
01:03:19,409 --> 01:03:22,202
except for one,
who mostly wants to throw rocks at me

1103
01:03:22,287 --> 01:03:24,454
and have me burned up by her dragon.

1104
01:03:25,999 --> 01:03:27,958
A securities blanket.

1105
01:03:28,042 --> 01:03:32,963
Fine, fine. Keep your secret.
Just keep me in the black.

1106
01:03:36,050 --> 01:03:38,052
l can get a blanket.

1107
01:03:40,389 --> 01:03:42,807
l can. And l'm going to get one.

1108
01:03:44,268 --> 01:03:47,020
l need to see you guys
in my office, please.

1109
01:03:47,104 --> 01:03:50,398
You may have noticed l've been doing
things a little differently this past week,

1110
01:03:50,482 --> 01:03:53,776
letting the two of you go head-to-head
a bit more than usual.

1111
01:03:53,861 --> 01:03:58,239
And l know you've probably
heard the rumor, and it's true.

1112
01:03:58,324 --> 01:04:01,784
There's an offer on the table,
and it's big.

1113
01:04:01,870 --> 01:04:04,413
lt's the kind of out l've been looking for.

1114
01:04:04,497 --> 01:04:10,670
But the buyer wants to make sure that
there's someone worthy to, well,

1115
01:04:10,755 --> 01:04:14,382
to take this office. So...

1116
01:04:16,177 --> 01:04:17,427
Here we go.

1117
01:04:17,511 --> 01:04:22,349
Gentlemen, this is
Mr. Pratt of D.D.E. lnvestments.

1118
01:04:22,433 --> 01:04:25,727
- You're Frederick Pratt.
- Yes. Yes, l am. Excuse me.

1119
01:04:25,811 --> 01:04:28,605
- Yes, sir.
- That's the suitor? Dante D'Enzo?

1120
01:04:28,689 --> 01:04:30,607
- He's ready for you.
- Hello there.

1121
01:04:30,691 --> 01:04:34,069
Mr. D'Enzo.
What an honor it is to meet you, sir.

1122
01:04:34,153 --> 01:04:37,697
Thank you. Have a seat, gentIemen.
This won't take Iong.

1123
01:04:37,782 --> 01:04:40,117
l assume that Tom
has aIready toId you about...

1124
01:04:44,790 --> 01:04:46,832
- Mr. DanieIson, everything okay?
- Yes. Yes, sir.

1125
01:04:46,917 --> 01:04:49,293
Just had to kill the phone. lt's dead now.

1126
01:04:49,378 --> 01:04:52,046
Okay, l assume Tom
had aIready toId you that

1127
01:04:52,130 --> 01:04:55,424
he's decided to throw away
the rest of his Iife pIaying goIf.

1128
01:04:55,509 --> 01:05:00,096
Which means one of you is going to be
running the western division of D.D.E.

1129
01:05:00,180 --> 01:05:03,307
Now, you won't be surprised to know
that I've been reviewing your fiIes,

1130
01:05:03,392 --> 01:05:07,478
and, frankIy, you're both
appIying quite unorthodox methods.

1131
01:05:07,562 --> 01:05:11,483
And I don't reaIIy care, as Iong as you
get resuIts, which you seem to be doing.

1132
01:05:11,567 --> 01:05:13,236
But, unfortunateIy, gentIemen,

1133
01:05:13,320 --> 01:05:16,239
there's onIy one chair
behind the big desk.

1134
01:05:16,323 --> 01:05:19,325
So I have a decision to make,
and I'II be stopping in Denver

1135
01:05:19,410 --> 01:05:22,078
on my way back from Beijing tomorrow
to make that decision.

1136
01:05:22,162 --> 01:05:25,164
In the meantime,
you have approximateIy 17 hours

1137
01:05:25,249 --> 01:05:28,376
to suss out what Mr. Pratt
is about to hand you.

1138
01:05:28,460 --> 01:05:30,795
And as far as preparation is concerned,

1139
01:05:30,879 --> 01:05:33,756
I'II just share with you
the best advice that l ever heard...

1140
01:05:41,016 --> 01:05:42,182
No, that's not the advice.

1141
01:05:42,267 --> 01:05:45,853
The advice is, if I had eight hours
to chop down a tree,

1142
01:05:45,937 --> 01:05:49,148
I'd spend the first six sharpening my ax.

1143
01:05:49,232 --> 01:05:51,525
- Abraham Lincoln.
- You read my book.

1144
01:05:51,609 --> 01:05:54,111
- Three times, sir.
- lt wasn't clear the first time?

1145
01:05:55,238 --> 01:05:56,572
No, that's not what l meant.

1146
01:05:56,656 --> 01:05:59,366
I think I know what you meant,
Mr. Danielson.

1147
01:05:59,451 --> 01:06:02,036
AII right, gentIemen,
it's 2:00 a.m. in Beijing.

1148
01:06:02,120 --> 01:06:04,038
Do you know where your ax is?

1149
01:06:04,122 --> 01:06:06,290
I'II see you tomorrow.
May the best man win.

1150
01:06:09,127 --> 01:06:12,255
These are a few of the strategies
Mr. D'Enzo is considering.

1151
01:06:12,339 --> 01:06:16,384
We will require your most
detailed analysis and recommendations.

1152
01:06:16,469 --> 01:06:18,136
l'll leave you with Mr. Pratt.

1153
01:06:20,514 --> 01:06:23,017
Okay, page one.

1154
01:06:30,901 --> 01:06:34,111
Olivia! Hey! Olivia!

1155
01:06:34,196 --> 01:06:37,782
Big night! Big, big night tonight! Hey!
Where are you?

1156
01:06:37,866 --> 01:06:40,744
l want to talk to princesses
and Qwali and all your friends!

1157
01:06:40,828 --> 01:06:42,746
Got a lot of questions!
Get to stay up late!

1158
01:06:42,830 --> 01:06:46,500
Hey, Olivia! Hey! Where are you?

1159
01:06:47,460 --> 01:06:49,586
Graciella, where is she? You picked
her up from school, didn't you?

1160
01:06:49,670 --> 01:06:52,172
Yes, señor. Then Mrs. Trish came
and took her away.

1161
01:06:52,256 --> 01:06:55,175
- What? When?
- About one hour ago.

1162
01:06:55,259 --> 01:06:57,177
Now, why would she do that
without calling me?

1163
01:06:57,261 --> 01:07:00,430
You know why? Because
l took the battery out of my phone.

1164
01:07:01,766 --> 01:07:03,934
Hey, listen!
Hey, did Olivia leave that little blanket?

1165
01:07:04,018 --> 01:07:06,770
- The goo-gaa?
- Let me check, okay, señor?

1166
01:07:06,854 --> 01:07:08,188
- Hello!
- Trish! Hey!

1167
01:07:08,689 --> 01:07:09,815
Evan, where are you?

1168
01:07:09,899 --> 01:07:13,277
Olivia called you, like, five times,
then she got upset and called me.

1169
01:07:13,362 --> 01:07:14,862
And then l had to leave the pledge drive
to make sure...

1170
01:07:14,947 --> 01:07:16,447
lt's a long story.
l took the battery out of my phone.

1171
01:07:16,532 --> 01:07:18,116
But, listen, you'll never guess
who l was just talking to.

1172
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:20,076
Not now, Evan. l'm at the party.

1173
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:22,120
- The party? What party?
- Ella's party.

1174
01:07:22,204 --> 01:07:24,914
- Which you obviously forgot about.
- Forgot it. Forgot all about the party.

1175
01:07:24,998 --> 01:07:27,500
Okay, listen, tell Olivia l'm gonna be
there in 20 minutes to pick her up.

1176
01:07:27,584 --> 01:07:28,751
Why? I'm aIready here.

1177
01:07:28,836 --> 01:07:30,962
Look, you did your week.
l'll just stay here

1178
01:07:31,046 --> 01:07:32,923
and take her to Ella's for the sleepover.

1179
01:07:33,007 --> 01:07:36,385
Sleepover! No, no, no. l don't know if
a sleepover works for me tonight, Trish.

1180
01:07:36,469 --> 01:07:40,055
l actually need Olivia here with me.
Here with me and her blanket, yes.

1181
01:07:40,140 --> 01:07:41,224
Her what?

1182
01:07:41,308 --> 01:07:42,684
Listen, l know this is going to sound
a little crazy.

1183
01:07:42,768 --> 01:07:44,686
l know this is going to sound a little wild,

1184
01:07:44,770 --> 01:07:46,563
but the fact of the matter is...

1185
01:07:48,023 --> 01:07:51,025
l need... l need the goo-gaa.

1186
01:07:52,111 --> 01:07:54,154
l don't have a response for that, Evan.

1187
01:07:54,238 --> 01:07:56,072
- No, Trish, Iisten.
- l'm hanging up now.

1188
01:07:56,407 --> 01:07:58,408
- Bye.
- No, no, no, Trish, Trish, Trish!

1189
01:08:12,716 --> 01:08:15,217
Okay, if you're here
for EIIa's birthday party,

1190
01:08:15,302 --> 01:08:18,554
make your way to the orange sIide
and into the Kidz Only zone

1191
01:08:18,638 --> 01:08:20,723
for some Fo Fo FiggIey fun.

1192
01:08:20,807 --> 01:08:22,099
Olivia!

1193
01:08:23,935 --> 01:08:26,478
- Trish, you want me...
- No, l'll deal with this.

1194
01:08:28,648 --> 01:08:30,065
Olivia!

1195
01:08:30,650 --> 01:08:33,527
Evan, what is going on?
What are you doing here?

1196
01:08:33,612 --> 01:08:35,362
l know, l know. Everything's fine.
Everything's cool.

1197
01:08:35,447 --> 01:08:37,114
Look, where did she go just now?

1198
01:08:37,199 --> 01:08:39,533
She went into the Kidz Only room.
What is this, Evan?

1199
01:08:39,618 --> 01:08:40,994
Nothing. Everything's fine.
Everything's cool.

1200
01:08:41,078 --> 01:08:42,747
- Hey. How we doing over here?
- What's going on? How you?

1201
01:08:42,831 --> 01:08:43,956
l'm good.

1202
01:08:44,041 --> 01:08:46,542
Trish, do you mind helping Lori
with the cake for me?

1203
01:08:46,627 --> 01:08:47,710
Yeah, help Lori with the cake,

1204
01:08:47,794 --> 01:08:49,462
and l'm gonna do
what l was going to do.

1205
01:08:49,546 --> 01:08:52,381
- lt's my daughter's seventh birthday!
- Congratulations.

1206
01:08:52,466 --> 01:08:53,591
You're going to think this is hilarious,

1207
01:08:53,675 --> 01:08:56,010
but l got to go get Olivia's blanket for,
like, six hours.

1208
01:08:56,094 --> 01:08:58,721
- You need her blanket.
- Yes, l need her blanket.

1209
01:08:58,805 --> 01:09:01,057
l see, so that's what you're here for,
to cause a scene.

1210
01:09:01,141 --> 01:09:02,516
l'm not trying to cause a scene at all.

1211
01:09:02,601 --> 01:09:04,894
You're making it a scene by stopping
me from going to get the blanket.

1212
01:09:04,978 --> 01:09:07,313
You should just let me go get the
blanket, and there's no scene at all.

1213
01:09:07,397 --> 01:09:08,940
- Let me talk to you for a second.
- What's the problem?

1214
01:09:09,024 --> 01:09:11,400
Now we've all seen what happens
when you take Liv's blanket, right?

1215
01:09:11,485 --> 01:09:14,488
- Okay, that's duly noted.
- And now is not the time nor place for it.

1216
01:09:14,572 --> 01:09:17,407
Let me explain something to you.
Let me say something.

1217
01:09:17,492 --> 01:09:19,368
What l'm going to do
is going to take all of 10 seconds.

1218
01:09:19,452 --> 01:09:21,245
l'm gonna get the blanket,
and l'm going to be gone.

1219
01:09:21,329 --> 01:09:23,580
And that's the end of the deal,
you know what l'm saying, John?

1220
01:09:23,665 --> 01:09:26,375
Let me do my thing.
Hey, what's the matter with you?

1221
01:09:26,459 --> 01:09:27,459
John...

1222
01:09:28,086 --> 01:09:30,003
Hey, what's up
with the football block, man?

1223
01:09:31,089 --> 01:09:32,798
- Hey, be cool.
- You be cool, okay?

1224
01:09:32,882 --> 01:09:36,134
l am being cool. l just need the goo-gaa!

1225
01:09:36,219 --> 01:09:38,971
Okay, when a grown man says
"goo-gaa," it's time to go.

1226
01:09:39,055 --> 01:09:40,347
Okay, all right.

1227
01:09:43,227 --> 01:09:45,228
Okay, all right. lt's cool. All right.
You made your point.

1228
01:09:45,312 --> 01:09:48,856
You got it. You gotta be cool.

1229
01:09:49,525 --> 01:09:52,486
l'll tell her you said happy birthday.
Yeah.

1230
01:09:53,655 --> 01:09:55,406
She'll be touched.

1231
01:10:02,289 --> 01:10:04,790
Hey, John. ls everything okay?

1232
01:10:04,874 --> 01:10:07,668
- l took care of it. He's gone.
- What did you say?

1233
01:10:07,752 --> 01:10:09,837
Don't worry about it.
l put my foot down, okay?

1234
01:10:09,921 --> 01:10:12,172
That's the last we're gonna see
of Evan today.

1235
01:10:30,651 --> 01:10:33,903
You wanna play, boy? Man, stop.
No, you didn't.

1236
01:10:34,071 --> 01:10:37,657
Hey, little brother. Hey, brother.
Hey, my man. Hey, little man.

1237
01:10:37,742 --> 01:10:40,493
Hey, why don't you do me a favor?
l want you to go into the Kidz Only room

1238
01:10:40,578 --> 01:10:42,579
and talk to Olivia Danielson and tell her
her dad's out here.

1239
01:10:42,663 --> 01:10:45,166
l'm gonna give you $20. Go in there
and tell her that her dad's out here

1240
01:10:45,250 --> 01:10:47,501
- and needs the goo-gaa.
- A what?

1241
01:10:47,586 --> 01:10:49,879
lt's a goo-gaa. lt's a pet name for
the blanket. l need the blanket.

1242
01:10:49,963 --> 01:10:52,381
Just go in, tell Olivia Danielson
her dad's out here and get the blanket.

1243
01:10:52,466 --> 01:10:53,924
$20, man. Come on, brother.

1244
01:10:54,009 --> 01:10:56,427
- l'll take $50, my brother.
-50?

1245
01:10:56,511 --> 01:11:00,389
Or you can take your grown self up there
and get the goo-gaa on your own.

1246
01:11:01,976 --> 01:11:04,269
Hey, stop it! l'm not in here
to play with you kids. Stop it!

1247
01:11:04,354 --> 01:11:07,189
Look, man, l haven't been to the
cash machine. All l got is $26 in here.

1248
01:11:07,273 --> 01:11:09,733
See, that's more than half of $50.

1249
01:11:11,569 --> 01:11:13,237
And l got this.

1250
01:11:13,947 --> 01:11:16,282
A Peet's Coffee card.
l got $15 worth of credit on it.

1251
01:11:16,367 --> 01:11:17,992
You know how much coffee
you can get for $15?

1252
01:11:18,077 --> 01:11:20,495
You drink that coffee, you just keep
playing and playing and playing!

1253
01:11:20,579 --> 01:11:22,747
- l'm a kid. l don't drink coffee.
- They got other things.

1254
01:11:22,831 --> 01:11:25,875
They got cookies and cakes and scones.
You like scones?

1255
01:11:25,959 --> 01:11:28,461
Scones? What do l look like,
the Queen of England?

1256
01:11:29,254 --> 01:11:31,381
Hey, you stop that right now!
l'm not here to play with you!

1257
01:11:31,465 --> 01:11:33,841
- l'm talking to this child!
- That's a nice Rollie.

1258
01:11:33,926 --> 01:11:35,927
Yes, that is a nice Rollie,
and you just back on up.

1259
01:11:36,011 --> 01:11:38,388
You're not getting my Rollie.
Come on, man. This is $26.

1260
01:11:38,472 --> 01:11:42,433
$26, a Peet's Coffee card. That's some
easy money. You want it or not?

1261
01:11:42,518 --> 01:11:44,353
Not. Get this fool!

1262
01:11:46,189 --> 01:11:47,648
Hey, stop it right now!

1263
01:11:51,820 --> 01:11:53,987
Grandfather, will you bless the blanket?

1264
01:12:04,416 --> 01:12:07,835
Here's the... This guy?

1265
01:12:07,919 --> 01:12:10,964
The blanket works best
through the innocence of a child.

1266
01:12:13,509 --> 01:12:15,886
Okay. Good. Thank you.

1267
01:12:17,848 --> 01:12:21,600
- lndigo! Wake up, buddy. Hey! Hey!
- What? What?

1268
01:12:21,685 --> 01:12:23,352
Wake up.
You're going on a vision quest.

1269
01:12:23,437 --> 01:12:27,022
- l don't wanna. l'm tired.
- Well, you're gonna.

1270
01:12:27,107 --> 01:12:29,775
Your new tribal name, Red Bull.

1271
01:12:33,905 --> 01:12:37,283
Okay, l got this. l can do this.

1272
01:12:37,367 --> 01:12:38,617
l'm thinking it through,
and l'm letting it flow.

1273
01:12:38,702 --> 01:12:40,536
And l can do this,
and l do not need the goo-gaa.

1274
01:12:41,872 --> 01:12:43,789
Let it flow, Evan. Just let it flow.

1275
01:12:43,874 --> 01:12:47,377
Okay, l know this company. Yes.
l don't know this company. No.

1276
01:12:50,298 --> 01:12:51,381
l don't need the goo-gaa,

1277
01:12:51,466 --> 01:12:52,924
l don't need the goo-gaa,
'cause this is what l do.

1278
01:12:55,219 --> 01:12:58,138
Look at that. All right, how you feel?
How you feel?

1279
01:12:58,222 --> 01:13:00,432
- l'm still tired.
- Yeah, you're still tired? Get up there.

1280
01:13:00,516 --> 01:13:01,683
Hey, what is this?

1281
01:13:01,767 --> 01:13:06,563
The relationship of this currency
to this company five years out.

1282
01:13:08,524 --> 01:13:11,902
Maybe if you want,
you can talk to them yourself.

1283
01:13:14,363 --> 01:13:16,532
This is a wakalyapi, okay?

1284
01:13:16,992 --> 01:13:20,162
Star blanket.
l need you to feel the magic.

You want to go to bed? Bull!

goo-gaa. Here's my goo-gaa. Okay?

1317
01:17:35,345 --> 01:17:39,432
- Hey, Ella. How are you?
- Why are you stealing our blankets?

1318
01:17:39,516 --> 01:17:40,600
l'm not stealing them.

1319
01:17:40,684 --> 01:17:42,435
l'm taking them to get them cleaned,
because they're dirty.

1320
01:17:42,519 --> 01:17:44,479
You go back to sleep. Night-night.

1325
01:18:01,707 --> 01:18:02,791
l'm taking the blankets
to get them cleaned.

1326
01:18:02,875 --> 01:18:04,125
You go back to bed.
You're having a bad dream.

1327
01:18:04,210 --> 01:18:05,668
- This is my sister's blanket.
- Go back to bed.

1328
01:18:05,753 --> 01:18:06,795
Be a good little boy,
and go back to bed now.

1329

- No, give it.

For God's sake, Evan!
Have you any dignity at all?

- Yes, l do!
- No, you don't. Look at you.

1336
01:18:25,899 --> 01:18:29,485
- And now they're up.
- Hey, you are stealing our blankets.

1337
01:18:29,569 --> 01:18:31,654
See? Now you messed with my little girl.
Give me them!

Everybody calm down! Calm down!

01:18:36,618 --> 01:18:38,327
Okay, all right. Here you go.

1341
01:18:38,411 --> 01:18:40,996
Here's your blanket! l just want this one!
Okay, it's all good now.

1342
01:18:41,081 --> 01:18:42,998
- You're not taking no blanket!
- l paid for this blanket!

1343
01:18:43,083 --> 01:18:45,334
- l don't care what you paid for!
- Wait, wait. lt's little Evan.

1344
01:18:45,418 --> 01:18:47,169
Now you want to whisper? No, no.

1345
01:18:47,254 --> 01:18:49,422
- Come on, man!
- No.

1346
01:18:49,507 --> 01:18:51,508
- Come on, man.
- Get out.

1347
01:18:52,927 --> 01:18:54,386
lt's okay, baby. Will!

1348
01:19:00,017 --> 01:19:01,977
This blanket is mine! lt's mine!

1349
01:19:02,061 --> 01:19:06,314
l'm calling Trish.
Nice, Evan. Really nice.

1350
01:19:07,358 --> 01:19:08,776
Evan, get help. Get help!

1351
01:19:08,861 --> 01:19:10,528
l don't need help.
What l need is my blanket!

1352
01:19:10,612 --> 01:19:14,156
- Man, you're crazy!
- l am not crazy! l want my goo-gaa!

1353
01:19:15,284 --> 01:19:16,951
l want my goo-gaa!

1354
01:19:17,369 --> 01:19:20,706
- John! John! This is important!
- l'm calling the police!

1355
01:19:20,790 --> 01:19:22,833
l want my goo-gaa! l want my goo-gaa!

1356
01:19:22,917 --> 01:19:24,376
John, come on, man,
this is life and death!

1357
01:19:24,460 --> 01:19:27,379
We're gonna go back to bed.
Everybody, back to bed.

1358
01:19:40,476 --> 01:19:41,977
Yeah, man!

1359
01:19:43,313 --> 01:19:44,771
Johnny!

1360
01:19:44,856 --> 01:19:48,066
Come inside before the neighbors
call the fire department again!

1361
01:19:48,151 --> 01:19:50,612
Hey, Cheryl! We're down here working!

1362
01:19:50,696 --> 01:19:53,364
You think your new nose
just crawled on your face?

1363
01:19:56,410 --> 01:19:57,869
- What's the next one?
- John!

1364
01:19:57,953 --> 01:19:58,953
Yeah.

1365
01:19:59,371 --> 01:20:02,081
- l'm sorry. Look...
- What's up, bro?

1366
01:20:02,833 --> 01:20:04,918
Listen, it's getting late.

1367
01:20:05,002 --> 01:20:08,421
l think we need
to rethink this blanket strategy.

1368
01:20:08,839 --> 01:20:11,132
- You doubting the wakalyapi?
- No, no, no. Absolutely not.

1369
01:20:11,216 --> 01:20:14,135
So, you are saying that
my son's not a seer?

1370
01:20:15,012 --> 01:20:19,099
- ls that what you are saying?
- l see beyond, like the great salmon!

1371
01:20:19,184 --> 01:20:21,311
With wings! That flies!

1372
01:20:21,395 --> 01:20:23,021
You got tiny eyes, man.

1373
01:20:23,105 --> 01:20:26,024
- You got the eyes of a salamander.
- What?

1374
01:20:26,108 --> 01:20:28,526
You say my kid's not a seer?
He's a Whitefeather!

1375
01:20:28,611 --> 01:20:30,987
Come here, boy! Get over here!

1376
01:20:31,072 --> 01:20:33,406
AampCo! What you feeling
about AampCo?

1377
01:20:33,491 --> 01:20:35,075
AampCo is tight!

1378
01:20:35,159 --> 01:20:38,286
- AampCo is tight! Write that down!
- Write that down!

1379
01:20:38,371 --> 01:20:40,497
No, Johnny,
l'm not gonna write it down, okay?

1380
01:20:40,581 --> 01:20:43,291
l can't go to Dante D'Enzo and say,
"AampCo is tight

1381
01:20:43,376 --> 01:20:45,210
"because we're listening
to the Great Winged Salmon,

1382
01:20:45,294 --> 01:20:48,630
"who's actually a 10-year-old boy
with a $6,000 blanket,

1383
01:20:48,714 --> 01:20:50,967
"who's hopped up on Red Bull!"

1384
01:20:53,720 --> 01:20:56,889
Listen to me, Johnny.
This is an opportunity of a lifetime.

1385
01:20:56,974 --> 01:20:59,976
We can't blow this thing.
You are better than this.

1386
01:21:00,644 --> 01:21:02,937
- Tell him he's out.
- You're out!

1387
01:21:03,563 --> 01:21:05,648
- What?
- Tell him he's out of the tribe.

1388
01:21:05,732 --> 01:21:08,067
- You're out of the tribe!
- l'm out of the tribe?

1389
01:21:08,151 --> 01:21:12,321
You're out of the tribe, because
you're blind to the poetry of smoke!

1390
01:21:12,406 --> 01:21:13,489
Blind to the poetry of...

1391
01:21:13,573 --> 01:21:16,659
Stop it! Just zip it! Zip it!
You are a crazy little kid!

1392
01:21:16,743 --> 01:21:19,787
And you, you're a liar! l'm out?

1393
01:21:19,871 --> 01:21:24,626
Good. Wrap it up! l have never been
so happy to be out, okay?

1394
01:21:24,711 --> 01:21:28,756
l didn't go to business school for this!
l graduated from Stanford with an MBA!

1395
01:21:28,841 --> 01:21:31,926
And they don't just give
those things away, Whitefeather!

1396
01:21:33,220 --> 01:21:35,972
- Get him.
- Back off, you little freak!

1397
01:21:37,266 --> 01:21:38,766
Get some sleep!

1398
01:21:40,894 --> 01:21:42,645
Hey, Trish, it's me!

1399
01:21:46,108 --> 01:21:50,654
- Trish, l really need to see her.
- No, no. l just now got her to sleep.

1400
01:21:50,739 --> 01:21:52,906
And with tonight,
and singing tomorrow...

1401
01:21:52,991 --> 01:21:55,617
- Please. Please, Trish.
- She just...

1402
01:21:58,621 --> 01:21:59,705
Okay.

1403
01:22:00,206 --> 01:22:01,540
Thank you.

1404
01:22:07,964 --> 01:22:09,757
Can you please leave?

1405
01:22:11,926 --> 01:22:15,512
Hey, Liv, l'm sorry about
what happened at the sleepover.

1406
01:22:15,597 --> 01:22:17,306
l want you to go.

1407
01:22:19,142 --> 01:22:21,061
About the concert...

1408
01:22:21,145 --> 01:22:23,396
l'm not going to be able to
come to the concert,

1409
01:22:23,481 --> 01:22:25,523
because it's at the same time
as a meeting l have to...

1410
01:22:25,608 --> 01:22:27,150
l don't want you there.

1411
01:22:31,197 --> 01:22:32,947
Okay. l understand.

1412
01:22:33,491 --> 01:22:36,910
l just want you to know that
l really did want to go.

1413
01:22:36,994 --> 01:22:40,081
l don't care. Don't come.

1414
01:22:41,583 --> 01:22:42,833
l won't.

1415
01:22:43,502 --> 01:22:45,544
l won't because you don't want me to.

1416
01:22:47,464 --> 01:22:48,631
But...

1417
01:22:49,674 --> 01:22:51,343
Liv, l really have to go to this meeting.

1418
01:22:51,427 --> 01:22:54,846
lt's really important. lt's a really
important meeting, and l really need...

1419
01:23:15,034 --> 01:23:18,328
Promise l'll get it right back to you.
Night-night.

1420
01:23:33,137 --> 01:23:35,346
lt's okay. She's fine. She gave it to me.

1421
01:23:36,890 --> 01:23:39,142
- What?
- She told me, Evan.

1422
01:23:39,226 --> 01:23:41,269
- Everything.
- Okay, well, then you understand.

1423
01:23:41,353 --> 01:23:43,729
No, l don't understand.

1424
01:23:43,814 --> 01:23:46,149
l mean, do you honestly believe that
that blanket

1425
01:23:46,233 --> 01:23:48,819
has something to do
with everything that's been going on?

1426
01:23:48,903 --> 01:23:51,780
Look, l don't know what's happening.
l know something's happening.

1427
01:23:51,866 --> 01:23:54,200
l need for it to happen
one more time tonight.

1428
01:23:54,910 --> 01:23:57,245
So, now we're back to what you need.

1429
01:23:57,788 --> 01:23:58,913
Hey, Trish, what do you want me to do?

1430
01:23:58,998 --> 01:24:01,291
Blow off an opportunity
l've been waiting for since grad school

1431
01:24:01,375 --> 01:24:02,667
and lose my job?

1432
01:24:02,751 --> 01:24:08,756
Evan, you have two jobs,
and one of those jobs is being a father.

1433
01:24:08,841 --> 01:24:10,049
And she needs to know

1434
01:24:10,134 --> 01:24:13,344
that you care as much about that job
as you do the other.

1435
01:24:13,429 --> 01:24:16,723
- l do. Of course l do.
- Then leave the blanket.

1436
01:24:19,602 --> 01:24:22,938
l can't. Not tonight, l can't.

1437
01:24:23,940 --> 01:24:25,774
l don't expect you to understand.

1438
01:26:31,657 --> 01:26:34,492
How you doing, Feather Man?
Pretty good, brother. How you doing?

1439
01:26:34,577 --> 01:26:38,538
Not so bad. A little amped, a little tired.
Ain't nothing but a thing.

1440
01:26:38,622 --> 01:26:40,582
How about another Red Bull?
Wouldn't say no to that.

1441
01:27:29,802 --> 01:27:32,720
- Good luck, Johnny.
- Luck is for losers.

1442
01:27:36,892 --> 01:27:40,436
Good. Here we are.
Gentlemen, this is Mr. D'Enzo.

1443
01:27:41,563 --> 01:27:42,897
- Hello.
- Nice to meet you, sir.

1444
01:27:42,981 --> 01:27:45,650
Mr. D'Enzo. John Whitefeather.

1445
01:27:45,734 --> 01:27:47,235
Have a seat, guys.

1446
01:27:54,034 --> 01:27:58,580
D- Papa-D to the Feather Man.
l think you're reading my signals.

1447
01:27:58,665 --> 01:28:00,249
And l think you're reading them
loud and clear.

1448
01:28:00,333 --> 01:28:03,669
You're getting the wisdom.
Diversification.

1449
01:28:03,753 --> 01:28:05,045
Buy long, sell short.

1450
01:28:05,130 --> 01:28:07,131
- Sell short, buy long.
- Hi.

1451
01:28:07,215 --> 01:28:09,967
Good morning, everyone.
Welcome to the Fall Sing.

1452
01:28:10,051 --> 01:28:12,761
It's so good to see
so many of you here today.

1453
01:28:12,846 --> 01:28:15,973
WeII, I can hear a Iot of
very excited chiIdren back there,

1454
01:28:16,057 --> 01:28:19,435
who, Iike their parents, are not here
to Iisten to me continue taIking.

1455
01:28:19,519 --> 01:28:25,150
So without further ado,
the wonderful Chilton School choir.

1456
01:28:41,168 --> 01:28:45,171
Summer fades into the blue

1457
01:28:45,255 --> 01:28:48,716
Brand new colors come into view

1458
01:28:49,426 --> 01:28:52,928
Seasons change
I have, too

1459
01:28:53,388 --> 01:28:57,225
Just like the leaves of autumn

1460
01:28:57,768 --> 01:29:01,396
You know what l see in this room
that nobody else sees?

1461
01:29:01,481 --> 01:29:02,731
Hidden feathers.

1462
01:29:02,815 --> 01:29:06,401
That's what we share, hidden feathers!
Crow feathers.

1463
01:29:07,778 --> 01:29:09,196
Right now,

1464
01:29:10,823 --> 01:29:12,365
l need you to caw with me.

1465
01:29:14,160 --> 01:29:16,161
One crow to another crow.

1466
01:29:23,252 --> 01:29:25,838
Bring it. Come on. Bring it in.

1467
01:29:36,391 --> 01:29:39,686
l know you want to let it out,
but l appreciate you keeping it in.

1468
01:29:41,773 --> 01:29:43,815
There it be, brother crow.

1469
01:29:45,443 --> 01:29:47,486
Look forward to working with you, man.

1470
01:29:52,575 --> 01:29:53,742
Wow.

1471
01:29:55,453 --> 01:29:57,872
l've never seen anything like that before.

1472
01:29:57,957 --> 01:29:59,374
l know.

1473
01:29:59,458 --> 01:30:01,876
No, you don't know.

1474
01:30:01,961 --> 01:30:06,339
Quite frankly, that's one of the
biggest loads of crap l've ever heard.

1475
01:30:07,216 --> 01:30:09,384
What possible excuse can you give us

1476
01:30:09,468 --> 01:30:14,180
for wasting our time
with that unctuous stream of drivel

1477
01:30:14,265 --> 01:30:16,182
that you call a presentation?

1478
01:30:19,061 --> 01:30:21,062
- My kid.
- What?

1479
01:30:21,146 --> 01:30:22,355
My kid.

1480
01:30:22,982 --> 01:30:26,276
He's been wanting to get more involved
in my workplace life.

1481
01:30:26,360 --> 01:30:28,904
He's like, "Dad, l'm on a vision quest.
l got some investment ideas."

1482
01:30:28,989 --> 01:30:32,324
l'm like, "You're nine.
How many good ideas could you have?"

1483
01:30:32,409 --> 01:30:34,785
He's on a vision quest. l'm like,
"Vision quest, my red butt! But..."

1484
01:30:34,869 --> 01:30:36,412
You're blaming your child?

1485
01:30:36,496 --> 01:30:40,416
- Look, don't let it rattle your corn stalk...
- All right, enough!

1486
01:30:41,418 --> 01:30:43,919
l don't mind this lndian business
when it's working.

1487
01:30:44,004 --> 01:30:48,008
- When it's not, it's just annoying.
- Whoa!

1488
01:30:48,092 --> 01:30:52,178
- That's deep shadow time.
- Seriously, cut the crap.

1489
01:30:53,806 --> 01:30:56,099
You're not even a real Native American.

1490
01:30:56,183 --> 01:30:58,936
The fact is
you're mostly Finnish-Armenian.

1491
01:30:59,021 --> 01:31:01,939
Your baptismal name
is Johann Hasuvian.

1492
01:31:02,024 --> 01:31:05,443
And your great-grandfather
was one half Navajo.

1493
01:31:05,527 --> 01:31:09,030
So, what would that make you? 1/32?

1494
01:31:10,324 --> 01:31:13,326
Frankly, you are an offense
to true Native Americans,

1495
01:31:13,410 --> 01:31:17,246
- and if you have nothing better to offer...
- All right, all right.

1496
01:31:17,331 --> 01:31:20,374
Johnny Whitefeather can see
which way this wind's blowing.

1497
01:31:22,794 --> 01:31:26,172
lt's your loss! Old croaking toad.

1498
01:31:33,056 --> 01:31:34,765
l'm going this way!

1499
01:31:39,729 --> 01:31:41,688
Well, Mr. Danielson?

1500
01:31:43,066 --> 01:31:45,651
Looks like this job is yours to lose.

1501
01:31:47,737 --> 01:31:49,529
l'll get right to it.

1502
01:32:04,047 --> 01:32:05,547
Mr. Danielson?

1503
01:32:06,257 --> 01:32:07,341
Evan?

1504
01:32:10,136 --> 01:32:11,512
l can't do this.

1505
01:32:12,347 --> 01:32:13,764
l'm sorry?

1506
01:32:14,099 --> 01:32:16,225
l messed up. l really have.

1507
01:32:16,601 --> 01:32:17,768
Sorry, what?

1508
01:32:21,231 --> 01:32:25,275
- Are you walking out?
- l'm really sorry, sir. l just can't.

1509
01:32:25,360 --> 01:32:27,194
You realize what you're giving up?

1510
01:32:31,784 --> 01:32:33,284
Yes, sir, l do.

1511
01:32:36,122 --> 01:32:37,747
Sorry, Tom.

1512
01:32:44,588 --> 01:32:46,214
Could l see that brochure, please?

1513
01:32:51,470 --> 01:32:54,097
Ain't nothing but a thing, man.

1514
01:33:28,259 --> 01:33:31,345
Next, we wiII sing
a traditionaI Japanese foIk song

1515
01:33:31,430 --> 01:33:34,849
about the bIooming
of the cherry blossom, the Sakura.

1516
01:34:20,981 --> 01:34:22,774
Sorry! Sorry about that!

1517
01:34:31,535 --> 01:34:35,162
The next song is one you aII know,
so feeI free to sing aIong.

1518
01:34:35,247 --> 01:34:38,415
Just don't sing Iouder than us.
lt's our concert.

1519
01:34:47,050 --> 01:35:25,798
## Love, Iove, Iove ##

1520
01:35:27,499 --> 01:35:31,500
Music sounds only

1521
01:35:51,201 --> 01:35:54,901
[door opening]

1522
01:36:28,280 --> 01:36:31,951
##There's nothing you can do ##

1523

## There's nothing you can make ##

1527
01:36:46,050 --> 01:36:49,177
## No one you can save ##
## That can't be saved ##

1528
01:36:49,553 --> 01:36:53,390
## Nothing you can do ##

1529
01:36:53,474 --> 01:36:55,392

1538
01:37:45,154 --> 01:37:47,030
Nice king hat.

1539
01:37:48,449 --> 01:37:50,199
lt's called a crown.

1540
01:37:54,872 --> 01:37:57,040
You know,
you were really great in there.

1541
01:37:57,124 --> 01:37:59,834
- Thanks.
- Hey, listen, l got something for you.

1542
01:38:02,797 --> 01:38:05,466
- l don't need it anymore.
- Really?

1543
01:38:06,259 --> 01:38:07,718
l was hoping you would take it,
and, you know,

1544
01:38:07,802 --> 01:38:10,054
you'd help me apologize
to the princesses.

1545
01:38:10,138 --> 01:38:12,848
- You can do it yourself.
- l can?

1546
01:38:12,932 --> 01:38:14,516
Yeah, they're right there.

1547
01:38:16,269 --> 01:38:18,937
Okay. Well...

1548
01:38:20,356 --> 01:38:23,901
Sopida, l wish that l could say
you were wrong about me,

1549
01:38:23,985 --> 01:38:27,112
but, obviously,
you and your dragon knew better.

1550
01:38:27,197 --> 01:38:28,530
l'm sorry.

1551
01:38:29,657 --> 01:38:32,494
Thank you for protecting Olivia
while l was away.

1552
01:38:32,995 --> 01:38:35,163
And Kupida and Mopida,

1553
01:38:36,040 --> 01:38:39,959
l'm sorry for taking you for granted
and just expecting things from you

1554
01:38:40,044 --> 01:38:43,421
and not realizing how smart and kind

1555
01:38:44,757 --> 01:38:46,966
and truly amazing you really are.

1556
01:38:47,718 --> 01:38:49,302
Qwali, thank you so much

1557
01:38:49,386 --> 01:38:53,098
for letting me come into your mystical,
magical world,

1558
01:38:53,182 --> 01:38:58,354
- 'cause it's a truly magical...
- Daddy, they're leaving. They got bored.

1559
01:38:58,897 --> 01:39:00,648
They were bored.

1560
01:39:02,360 --> 01:39:04,903
Do you want me to ask them to stay?

1561
01:39:04,987 --> 01:39:06,696
Well, what do they want to do?

1562
01:39:10,201 --> 01:39:12,369
They said it's time for them to go.

1563
01:39:15,373 --> 01:39:17,499
Well, then l think they should go then.

1564
01:39:18,209 --> 01:39:19,709
Wave goodbye.

1565
01:39:26,092 --> 01:39:27,843
There they go.

1566
01:39:40,023 --> 01:39:41,899
Hey, guys. What you doing?

1567
01:39:42,609 --> 01:39:45,987
Just waving goodbye to Qwali
and the princesses.

1568
01:39:46,071 --> 01:39:49,198
Really? They're going away?

1569
01:39:50,576 --> 01:39:52,076
How about that?

1570
01:39:54,413 --> 01:39:57,331
You know, l think
there's somebody here to see you.

1571
01:40:04,007 --> 01:40:05,592
Wow, so, they're really gone?

1572
01:40:12,266 --> 01:40:13,683
Nice outfit.

1573
01:40:15,352 --> 01:40:18,688
l take it this is why
you walked out of our meeting.

1574
01:40:21,525 --> 01:40:25,236
Do you know how many people
have ever done anything like that to me?

1575
01:40:28,282 --> 01:40:30,366
- Two.
- Two.

1576
01:40:30,451 --> 01:40:34,330
You want to know where they are
in their careers right now?

1577
01:40:34,414 --> 01:40:37,583
Each one is running
a key division of my company.

1578
01:40:38,710 --> 01:40:42,171
l don't want any sycophants around me.
l want people with confidence

1579
01:40:42,255 --> 01:40:45,466
who are not afraid to make decisions,
even under pressure.

1580
01:40:46,259 --> 01:40:48,302
lncidentally, this is very good.

1581
01:40:50,138 --> 01:40:52,306
You are very good indeed,

1582
01:40:53,183 --> 01:40:55,935
and l want you
to head our western division.

1583
01:40:56,603 --> 01:40:59,605

so, please...

1584
01:41:05,655 --> 01:41:10,325
Sir, l would love to discuss it now,

1590
01:41:32,849 --> 01:41:37,688
- So, have a pleasant Saturday.
- You, too, sir.

1591
01:41:45,863 --> 01:41:47,781
So, what are you guys doing
with the rest of the day?

1592
01:41:47,865 --> 01:41:49,116
l don't know. What do you want to do?

1593
01:41:49,200 --> 01:41:53,662
