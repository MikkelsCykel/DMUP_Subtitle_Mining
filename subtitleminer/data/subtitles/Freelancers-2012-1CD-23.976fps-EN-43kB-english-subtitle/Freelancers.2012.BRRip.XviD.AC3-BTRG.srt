1
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,296
Unh

2
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:34,249
Yeah

3
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:35,793
Life in the city

4
00:01:39,141 --> 00:01:41,883
Street life is a hustle

5
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,470
Go on every day

6
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:46,136
This life in the city,
three strikes in the city

7
00:01:46,315 --> 00:01:49,148
Childhood go hard,
street life ain't pretty

8
00:01:49,318 --> 00:01:51,730
Young soldier watching
the block's vultures

9
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:54,440
Whips, women and paper
dominate the culture

10
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:57,027
Rocks, pills, weed, flocking,
pimping and pandering

11
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,657
Checks, credit, betting,
whatever hustle they handling

12
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:02,490
Lost morals for mayors,
undercover patrol

13
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:04,620
Scores of hos reside,
resident evil

14
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,327
Everyday sequels

15
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:08,867
Sony reds with bird's-eye views
or hood blues

16
00:02:09,046 --> 00:02:11,162
Get pinched
or shine through-- snitches

17
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:14,173
Street life is a hustle

18
00:02:14,343 --> 00:02:15,753
Go on every day

19
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:18,418
This life in the city,
three strikes in the city

20
00:02:18,597 --> 00:02:21,304
Childhood go hard,
street life ain't pretty...

21
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:25,016
The Queensborough Court
is now in session.

22
00:02:25,187 --> 00:02:27,018
Jonas Maldonado,

23
00:02:27,189 --> 00:02:29,145
Lucas Ryan, A.D. Valburn,

24
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:31,432
you're charged with criminal
possession of narcotics.

25
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:33,271
How do you defendants plead?

26
00:02:33,445 --> 00:02:35,060
Due to mitigating circumstances,

27
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:36,398
not guilty, Your Honor.

28
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:39,030
The defendants have no priors.
We request bail.

29
00:02:39,201 --> 00:02:40,657
Bail denied.

30
00:02:43,455 --> 00:02:46,117
Street life is a hustle

31
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:48,031
Go on every day

32
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:50,542
This life in the city,
three strikes in the city

33
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:53,454
Childhood go hard,
street life ain't pretty...

34
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:59,338
In light of the new information
presented by ADA Vecchio,

35
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:02,095
the three defendants are hereby
remanded to his custody.

36
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:03,755
Bailiff.

37
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:07,513
Street life is a hustle

38
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:09,474
Go on every day

39
00:03:09,648 --> 00:03:12,139
This life in the city,
hood strife, it's a pity

40
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:14,808
Childhood go hard,
street life ain't pretty.

41
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:18,737
Come on, man. You see me trying
to give a speech here.

42
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:21,364
Some of you have known
my best friends and l

43
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:23,901
since we were delinquent
altar boys in grade school.

44
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:26,741
Hey look, you can keep your
little giggles to yourself, all right?

45
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:28,496
I know things about you too.

46
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:30,453
You know,
it might've taken me a bit longer

47
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:33,118
to decide to join,
but thanks to some help--

48
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:37,164
you know, I just wanna say my pop--
if I could be

49
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:39,298
- half the cop my pop was--
- Aww.

50
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:42,586
Well, I hope I can be
half the cop my pop was.

51
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:45,005
I just wanna thank everybody
for coming out

52
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:46,673
and supporting me

53
00:03:46,852 --> 00:03:49,218
and my buddies who are
taking the plunge with me--

54
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:51,637
and of course, other cadets.

55
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:53,646
Yeah, other cadets.

56
00:03:53,817 --> 00:03:56,308
You know, um, let's party.

57
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:58,226
- Let's have a good time.
- Yeah! Let's party!

58
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:08,616
You're dangerous, boy,
you're dangerous...

59
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,281
- Hey you.
- Hey. What's up?

60
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:16,286
Congratulations, Jonas.

61
00:04:16,465 --> 00:04:18,547
I'm very proud of you.

62
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:22,550
But it's been years.

63
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:25,133
Why did you invite me?

64
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:29,057
You still crushing on me, Jonas?

65
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:30,888
I'm still trying to piss
your brother off.

66
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:32,643
I'm just kidding.

67
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:34,645
I'm still crushing on you a little bit.

68
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:36,226
- Okay.
- Is that okay?

69
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:38,938
Well, I was kinda
hoping we could settle

70
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,103
some unfinished business tonight.

71
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,897
Coincidence.
I was thinking the same thing.

72
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:49,156
All right, here we go--
four shots of tequila.

73
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:50,696
- Uh-oh.
- Ow.

74
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:52,956
- Remember what happened last time.
- Right.

75
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:55,663
- Uh-huh.
- Let me know if you need anything else.

76
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:57,828
- All right.
- All right, so may we be

77
00:04:58,006 --> 00:05:00,543
each other's eyes, ears and fists.

78
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:03,459
- To my boys.
- Hey, may we continue

79
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:05,298
to stay on the right side of the law...

80
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:08,680
- for once.
- To the ultimate hustle.

81
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:11,182
- Hey.
- Cheers.

82
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:15,386
Whoo!

83
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:18,432
- Ooh.
- Hit me up.

84
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:21,943
Hey, who invited Lydia?

85
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:25,605
- Who's the cougar?
- The cougar's how we got

86
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:28,526
in the academy.
I mean she helped us.

87
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:30,284
Your dad being a cop wasn't enough?

88
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:32,867
Remember when we were wild little kids?

89
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:35,828
I remember my brother
not being too happy

90
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:38,084
about some thug trying
to be my boyfriend at 1 6.

91
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:40,246
I remember slinging rock
for your brother.

92
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:43,586
- I remember your brother whipping--
- Mrs. Vecchio's husband

93
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,091
is the assistant DA.

94
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:46,877
We went to school with their son Kenny.

95
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:49,421
Anyway, after your brother
beat Malo down,

96
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:51,385
he snitched us out to the pigs.

97
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,222
That feels weird wearing
this uniform right now.

98
00:05:54,396 --> 00:05:56,512
Will you tell this fool
we're cops now?

99
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,555
- Law enforcement officers.
- What?

100
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:02,726
Yeah. Angie-- he--

101
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:04,735
he set us up with the police,

102
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:06,862
you know, while we was
carrying his product.

103
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:09,740
Mrs. V had her husband
pull some strings

104
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:11,867
to get us out of jail
and into the academy.

105
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:15,246
- Why would she do that for you guys?
- Dick for dollars.

106
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:19,284
- What's dick for dollars?
- Shh. Nigga, you crazy.

107
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:21,327
- Just-- shh shh.
- Yo, she was a freak.

108
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:23,622
She used to pay these two
to smash her once a week.

109
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,086
Now I never got to tap
the ADA's wife,

110
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:29,344
so I invited her.
I figure I'm due, right?

111
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:31,846
- You are an idiot. You know this.
- Maybe.

112
00:06:32,017 --> 00:06:34,929
- Yeah, there's something wrong.
- Congratulations to all of you.

113
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:39,563
Oh God, you've still got
a fine ass, Mrs. V.

114
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:42,270
- Thanks for coming, Mrs. V.
- You didn't invite me.

115
00:06:42,444 --> 00:06:45,481
- Can I please have a word with you?
- I got a word for you.

116
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:52,234
I got you here.

117
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:54,778
The least you could do is
sit down and talk with me.

118
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:56,366
I could speak to you.

119
00:06:57,792 --> 00:06:59,498
I know some things
that you need to know.

120
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:02,285
We know it wouldn't be possible
to be here without you.

121
00:07:02,464 --> 00:07:04,876
We know what you
and your husband did for us.

122
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:06,665
- How is he?
- Dead.

123
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:10,881
I'm sorry to hear that.

124
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:13,889
Now that I have your attention--

125
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:15,344
Why don't you just pull up a seat?

126
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:17,133
Just come grieve
over here for a second,

127
00:07:17,312 --> 00:07:18,552
Iike right in this area.

128
00:07:21,483 --> 00:07:22,723
Call me.

129
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:29,563
Would you still bend that over?

130
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:30,981
No. You?

131
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,659
Liar. Me too.

132
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:37,992
- In a heartbeat.
- He fucking tells everything, man.

133
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:40,578
Compliments
from the gentleman in the back.

134
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:47,960
- Who's that?
- I don't know.

135
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:49,499
I'ma go check it out.

136
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:57,674
Sit down.

137
00:07:59,688 --> 00:08:02,054
- Ah.
- Congratulations, Jonas.

138
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:05,099
- Thank you.
- No, you don't know me.

139
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:08,860
- But you know me.
- My name is Captain Joe Sarcone.

140
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:11,191
I head the Street Vice
Crimes Task Force.

141
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:12,776
Your dad and me were partners.

142
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:19,120
Now when you're done here,

143
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:21,372
I want you to be at this place--
just you.

144
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,455
God, you look just like him.

145
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,245
Sharkey's?

146
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:29,460
I'll leave a light on for you.

147
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:01,620
You like what you see?

148
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:04,123
Uh-huh.

149
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:07,582
For seven years, me and your old man
were as thick as thieves.

150
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:09,833
I promise this isn't

151
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:11,748
some polished-up hustle to entrap you.

152
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:14,633
It's all part of your birthright.
Welcome home.

153
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:17,762
By the end of the night
they're gonna know our names

154
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:21,891
But we never pay
'cause we'll all go up in flames

155
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:24,724
Put it on my tab

156
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:27,264
All the women and wine

157
00:09:28,777 --> 00:09:31,735
Put it on my tab...

158
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:33,611
Let me know if I can
get you anything else.

159
00:09:33,782 --> 00:09:35,067
Thank you.

160
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:40,277
Oh!

161
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:48,618
You know, I'm not the type of man
to ask a big question

162
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:51,664
without knowing the answer already.
Remember that.

163
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:54,298
Besides honoring
the memory of your father,

164
00:09:54,469 --> 00:09:56,460
- why did you become a cop?
- I don't know.

165
00:09:56,638 --> 00:09:58,503
Get a little respect
in the neighborhood,

166
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:00,296
maybe a little payback.

167
00:10:00,475 --> 00:10:02,136
Eh, one look at you,
I already know

168
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:04,141
you got respect on the street.

169
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:06,473
- Right?
- Yeah, a little bit.

170
00:10:06,648 --> 00:10:09,185
I'll ask you something else--
what's your life worth?

171
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:13,526
If you had to put a price tag on it,
what would you say your life's worth?

172
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:16,817
I don't know.
I never thought about that.

173
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:20,028
- Would you say 46 grand?
- I don't know.

174
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:22,740
Well, that's what the city of New York
seems to think it's worth--

175
00:10:22,914 --> 00:10:25,155
since you gotta go out there
and risk it every day.

176
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:29,121
Personally, I feel my life's
worth more than that.

177
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:31,786
A pat on the back
and an extra 1 0-grand-a-year raise

178
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:34,627
for a job well done isn't worth my life
or any of the lives of my men.

179
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:38,214
Either way, we gotta
get the job done, you know?

180
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:40,379
What we do here...

181
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:45,179
Iet's just call it the bonus system.

182
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:48,345
Corruption in this city,
let alone in this country,

183
00:10:48,523 --> 00:10:50,935
is far beyond what
any of us can imagine.

184
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:53,854
You confiscate a large sum of money--

185
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:56,861
trust me, everybody takes their piece
as the money moves up the ranks.

186
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:59,613
All we do here is we take our cut--
a finder's fee, that's all.

187
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:02,867
I spread it amongst my men,
everybody's happy.

188
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:06,363
Look, you wanna be on your own,

189
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:08,907
nickel and diming on the street,
that's your business.

190
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:11,918
But know this-- we are deep

191
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:13,328
and we are invisible,

192
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:15,622
all the way up
to the mayor's office.

193
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:18,542
There's the Maldonado seed.

194
00:11:20,263 --> 00:11:22,720
- You hungry?
- I can always eat.

195
00:11:22,891 --> 00:11:26,133
Kitchen never closes
and everybody eats at my table.

196
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:27,972
Hey, guys, what's it gonna be?

197
00:11:28,146 --> 00:11:29,556
You really trust everybody in here?

198
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:31,722
That door you just walked through...

199
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:34,937
only works one way-- in.

200
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:37,147
Once you're in, the only way out

201
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:39,938
is to the sounds
of gunshots and bagpipes.

202
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:41,902
Don't ever force my hand.

203
00:11:46,748 --> 00:11:49,239
That's your FTO,
Lieutenant Dennis Lureu.

204
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:51,829
Don't ever question Lureu.
Be like him.

205
00:11:52,003 --> 00:11:54,494
He's been my right hand
since your father left us.

206
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:58,540
I'll get your boys assigned
to the same precinct.

207
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:01,585
As for you--
no uniform, no beat.

208
00:12:03,348 --> 00:12:05,805
You work for me starting now--
if you accept.

209
00:12:07,602 --> 00:12:10,059
Your father always said
"Everybody's gotta stash

210
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,141
a bit of sock money for a rainy day."

211
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:20,687
To your father.

212
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:24,281
Tonight we celebrate.

213
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:26,488
Pick a girl. Have some fun.

214
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:31,035
- Thank you, sweetie.
- Yup.

215
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:33,291
What can I getcha?

216
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:35,247
How you doing?
I'm the new guy.

217
00:12:37,966 --> 00:12:39,797
Hi, new guy.
I'm sure you're really nice,

218
00:12:39,968 --> 00:12:41,674
- but I don't fuck cops.
- I just got here.

219
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:43,380
You're starting rumors
about me already?

220
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:45,510
- What, you're not a cop?
- No, I'm not a nice guy.

221
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:47,798
- Ah.
- Jonas Maldonado.

222
00:12:47,976 --> 00:12:50,308
Everybody calls me Malo.

223
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:51,558
"Malo"-- that's cute.

224
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:53,594
You're like a Puerto Rican bad guy.

225
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,434
Well, my mom's black.
My father's Puerto Rican.

226
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,223
- I don't do Puerto Ricans either.
- Damn.

227
00:12:57,402 --> 00:13:00,360
- Mmm.
- Where you from? What's your name?

228
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:02,316
Don't you have some nice girl
waiting for you somewhere?

229
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:03,980
- Come on.
- I don't want a nice girl.

230
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:05,989
- I want you.
- You're a charmer.

231
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,651
- Puerto Rico.
- You like peanut butter?

232
00:13:09,831 --> 00:13:11,321
- Yeah, I like peanut butter.
- Me too.

233
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:13,114
See, we got all this in common.
Wanna fuck?

234
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:17,706
- Unbelievable.
- I know a place.

235
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,086
Yeah, where?
For peanut butter or for fucking?

236
00:13:19,257 --> 00:13:21,669
- Both.
- Yeah, I bet you do.

237
00:13:21,843 --> 00:13:23,959
I don't know why
you're playing hard to get.

238
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:35,602
Oh!

239
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:37,559
Yeah, you motherfuckers
play too much.

240
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:40,350
- Arrest me, officer.
- Come back and get in your pocket.

241
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:49,739
Good morning.
Coffee? It's hot.

242
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:54,910
Man, you look soft.

243
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:57,033
What?

244
00:13:59,464 --> 00:14:01,125
Badge ain't what protects us out here.

245
00:14:01,299 --> 00:14:02,880
It's having the balls to use it.

246
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:05,042
You look like you're missing one.

247
00:14:07,722 --> 00:14:09,053
Let's get on outta here,

248
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:10,929
see if we can find
that missing ball, all right?

249
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:21,228
Hey.

250
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:25,103
What? What's going on?

251
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:28,656
Let me ask you something.

252
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:31,112
You think any of these
young brothers out here

253
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:34,324
got the same good sense you got
to try to better themselves?

254
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:36,660
I mean, most of them look like
they juvenile delinquents.

255
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:38,870
What you think? Right?

256
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:40,410
Hmm?

257
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:43,754
I mean-- l-- I don't know, sir.

258
00:14:43,925 --> 00:14:45,290
You know? Well, maybe.

259
00:14:45,468 --> 00:14:47,800
I mean, l-- I don't know.
Yes, no. You know?

260
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:50,928
No no no no no no no.
No no no no.

261
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:53,055
Don't do that.
Don't do that.

262
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:55,217
- Do what?
- Choke up.

263
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:57,260
"l don't know. I don't know."

264
00:14:57,438 --> 00:15:00,726
No. You know, you breathe
the same air as me, right?

265
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,107
- Yeah. That's right.
- You a black man just like me, right?

266
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:05,768
- Yes, sir.
- Learn to speak your mind, young blood.

267
00:15:05,947 --> 00:15:07,938
Don't be no stumblebum.

268
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:11,532
Now only thing I ask is that you keep

269
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:14,364
your eyes and your ears open, all right?

270
00:15:14,539 --> 00:15:16,996
Maybe be careful.
You might learn something.

271
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:20,408
But you learn to speak your mind.

272
00:15:28,219 --> 00:15:30,175
Come on, babe. Let it go.

273
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:32,507
Oh, damn.
You see the ass on that?

274
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:35,180
Who wouldn't hit that? Who?

275
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:36,887
Yo, I feel you on that.

276
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:40,348
Just gotta double bag
in respect for the wife, am I right?

277
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:42,559
No disrespect,
but you would nut in your pants,

278
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:44,849
- she let you get a whiff of the tasty.
- What?

279
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:47,234
- Look, English in the cruiser, please.
- Not like you'd do anything

280
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:48,861
with her man handcuffing
her right now.

281
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:54,070
- This motherfucker--
- What, you mean the gorilla?

282
00:15:54,245 --> 00:15:55,860
Watch this.

283
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:58,495
What's up?

284
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:01,032
- You got a problem?
- Come on, baby.

285
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,996
That's right, keep walking.

286
00:16:03,171 --> 00:16:04,377
It's not worth it.

287
00:16:04,547 --> 00:16:05,662
Enjoy your day.

288
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,501
That's some bullshit.

289
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:20,093
And that's how
you keep control of a filthy nigger.

290
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,312
Oh, it's like that?

291
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:25,518
Yeah, it's like that.

292
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:27,229
You got a problem with that, rookie?

293
00:16:47,048 --> 00:16:49,915
- You want a bump?
- No, I don't want none.

294
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:56,129
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

295
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,837
Buy, break it, bag it, sell it

296
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:40,097
Buy, break it,
bag it, sell it...

297
00:17:40,268 --> 00:17:43,055
- This is--
- Look at that.

298
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:44,719
Ain't got no home training.

299
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:47,104
Come on, sir.
Kids are gonna do what they want.

300
00:17:47,275 --> 00:17:49,482
When I was a youngster,

301
00:17:49,652 --> 00:17:53,190
doing what you want was
a privilege reserved for grown folk.

302
00:17:54,824 --> 00:17:56,735
You gotta remember
that our strength,

303
00:17:56,909 --> 00:18:00,117
our downfall,
lies with these youth.

304
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:03,863
Who they mimic is who they become,

305
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:06,453
and you know what they show.

306
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:09,543
So we gotta be aware
of what we show,

307
00:18:09,714 --> 00:18:13,457
stop giving them grays
a reason to hate our ass.

308
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:17,134
Hey, y'all, move. Let's go.

309
00:18:17,305 --> 00:18:18,761
- What?
- No, I said move.

310
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,011
Oh my--

311
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,635
Excuse me, sir-- the grays?

312
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:28,304
Yeah, the grays.

313
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:31,815
As in the gray-skinned,
gray-haired Caucasian crackers

314
00:18:31,986 --> 00:18:35,194
that you see smiling they smiles
on the TV talk show,

315
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:37,355
talking the nonsensical bullshit about

316
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:39,364
why the Negros call
each other the "N" word.

317
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:42,026
Huh? You heard that?

318
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:45,788
How they say it's because
we basically don't like ourselves

319
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,074
or each other.
But that's all right

320
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:50,493
that we don't take responsibility
for our actions

321
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:52,707
because, you know,
we don't know no better.

322
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:55,498
- Yeah, grays.
- Personally,

323
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:58,042
I've never had a problem
with the word "nigga," sir.

324
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:01,007
- You know, where I'm from, we--
- Oh!

325
00:19:01,182 --> 00:19:04,174
Oh, you-- so you must be one.

326
00:19:04,352 --> 00:19:06,092
I-- l--

327
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,226
I knew I smelled something.

328
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:10,513
Oh, man, come on.

329
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:14,058
I'm riding in the car
with a full-blown nigga in a uniform.

330
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:15,897
- Nigga in the uniform.
- Hey.

331
00:19:16,072 --> 00:19:17,482
You play ball, Mr. Nigga?

332
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:19,363
Yeah, I play a little hoop.

333
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:21,114
You know, but football was my thing.

334
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:23,947
- I was a wide receiver in high school.
- Yeah? Good.

335
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:26,157
I want you to come down
to a playground

336
00:19:26,332 --> 00:19:29,165
where I coach some kids
in the PAL team.

337
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:31,246
- They would love it, you know?
- Uh-huh.

338
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:34,787
You'd get a chance to meet
some proud young black men,

339
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:37,297
not like the ones you know.

340
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:47,884
What's up, Lureu?
Got some new shit.

341
00:19:48,062 --> 00:19:49,893
Always need a backup.

342
00:19:51,065 --> 00:19:52,555
Sometimes you need

343
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:54,519
a backup for your backup.

344
00:19:56,696 --> 00:19:58,732
Go ahead, get something
for yourself, a'ight?

345
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:09,163
Hey, you can't use the N-word.

346
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:10,914
Why the hell not?

347
00:20:11,085 --> 00:20:12,416
'Cause you ain't got a pass.

348
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:13,917
What, you do?

349
00:20:14,088 --> 00:20:16,625
Hell yes, I got a pass.

350
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:19,791
Let me guess-- you got
some African-American buddies?

351
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:21,834
Some brothers?

352
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:25,425
Look, I was assigned
as your training officer to train you

353
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:27,510
so you don't have
to learn the hard way.

354
00:20:27,685 --> 00:20:30,677
I got 1 5 years in the cruiser.
You got five hours.

355
00:20:30,855 --> 00:20:33,847
I'm trying to give you
the benefit of my experience.

356
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:37,020
Buddy, you can throw
yourself under a bus

357
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:39,355
to save one of these
fine African-Americans,

358
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:42,363
Puerto Ricans, lndians,
Asians, Muslims-- whatever.

359
00:20:42,533 --> 00:20:44,615
Me, I'm gonna stay in the car
and I'm gonna live,

360
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:47,276
have dinner with my wife and kid,
bang my girlfriend

361
00:20:47,455 --> 00:20:48,615
and collect my pension.

362
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:51,405
I could care less
about these monkeys.

363
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:54,792
- Fuck.
- And understand--

364
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:57,749
these animals will eat you alive
if you give 'em a chance.

365
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:02,591
Are we gonna have problems, rookie?

366
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:04,627
Hey.

367
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:06,466
When we're in this cruiser,

368
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,801
you better have my back

369
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:13,094
and you better do exactly
what I tell you. You got me?

370
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:16,264
Shit can get real crazy
out here really quick.

371
00:21:17,568 --> 00:21:19,058
So when the time comes,

372
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:21,602
you better get down like I tell you.

373
00:21:29,914 --> 00:21:32,872
All I got is this game

374
00:21:33,042 --> 00:21:35,658
And all I got
is my soul

375
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:38,543
I'll give you all I got
until it's gone...

376
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:41,296
Wait in the car, all right?

377
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:45,167
'Cause all I know
is just pain

378
00:21:45,346 --> 00:21:48,338
Done lost it all
but remain

379
00:21:48,516 --> 00:21:51,929
'Cause truth be told,
a nigga know at the end of the day

380
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:54,593
You gotta lose
before you could gain

381
00:21:54,772 --> 00:21:56,353
That's how you grow

382
00:21:56,524 --> 00:21:59,106
Gotta move, gotta get it,
gotta hustle, man

383
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:02,313
And be an overachiever
when they don't understand

384
00:22:02,488 --> 00:22:04,820
'Cause we got the upper hand
whenever they shuffle

385
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,355
I bet I'll royal flush you...

386
00:22:06,534 --> 00:22:08,991
What the fuck you think you doing,
selling drugs to kids?

387
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:10,617
- Come on, man!
- Fucking punk!

388
00:22:10,788 --> 00:22:12,904
Forgot the rules of the block, huh?

389
00:22:13,082 --> 00:22:14,822
Say it.
Say the rule.

390
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,615
- No candy for the kids.
- Mm-hmm.

391
00:22:16,794 --> 00:22:19,035
- I should book your little ass.
- Hey! Yo, hey!

392
00:22:19,213 --> 00:22:21,374
What are you doing?
Come on!

393
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:36,393
Hey!

394
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:40,101
What the fuck do you
think you're doing?

395
00:22:40,276 --> 00:22:42,267
- He was selling drugs to kids.
- I don't give a shit

396
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:43,729
if he was selling crack
to your grandmother!

397
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:45,735
If I tell you to wait in the car,
then you--

398
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:48,238
you wait in the car. A'ight?

399
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:05,964
A'ight.

400
00:23:06,135 --> 00:23:08,342
You're on the street now, Malo.

401
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:10,503
I never left the streets.

402
00:23:10,681 --> 00:23:13,218
It's a pretty easy first day.

403
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:15,553
Don't get used to it.

404
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:19,561
Man.

405
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:35,452
Jonas, you know that I love you, right?

406
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:39,323
Yeah, Pop.
I love you too.

407
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:41,833
You're a good kid.

408
00:23:43,339 --> 00:23:45,079
I like driving around with you, Pop.

409
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:46,337
Oh, I bet you do.

410
00:23:48,719 --> 00:23:50,175
Jonas.

411
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:54,383
Yeah, I figured you'd be here today.

412
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:03,389
- So you remembered.
- How could I forget?

413
00:24:05,653 --> 00:24:07,234
You haven't called.

414
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:11,651
Can we talk?

415
00:24:13,369 --> 00:24:16,156
- About what?
- You don't think about me?

416
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:19,163
I do. All the time.
You know that.

417
00:24:19,333 --> 00:24:21,369
I'm not gonna wait on you forever.

418
00:24:24,088 --> 00:24:25,828
Still working at your father's diner?

419
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:27,291
Yes.

420
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:29,422
If you'd come around
more often, you'd know that.

421
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:32,050
He needs me there.
He doesn't trust anyone else.

422
00:24:32,221 --> 00:24:35,429
- What about your brother?
- Angie-- the wannabe gangsta?

423
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:37,760
Please, don't even
get me started on that one.

424
00:24:37,935 --> 00:24:39,596
Still trying to be a tough guy?

425
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:45,768
I just wanna be happy, Jonas.

426
00:24:46,819 --> 00:24:48,104
I want you to be happy.

427
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:51,441
Why did you invite me
to your celebration at the bar?

428
00:24:53,409 --> 00:24:54,740
It's complicated. I--

429
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:57,993
I can't even explain it.

430
00:24:58,163 --> 00:25:00,449
Look, I gotta go to work, Cyn.

431
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:01,955
Jonas.

432
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:11,381
Do what you feel you gotta do, Cyn.

433
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:25,012
Officer requesting backup,
Parsons Boulevard.

434
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:27,772
- That's right around the corner.
- Yeah, I know where it is.

435
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:35,947
Put the pin.
Pull it, nigga, pull the pin.

436
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:38,859
- Shut up, both of you!
- Come on, nigga!

437
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:40,949
Hey, shut up, both of you!
Shut the hell up!

438
00:25:41,123 --> 00:25:43,284
Hey, put the gun on the ground
and step away from it!

439
00:25:43,459 --> 00:25:46,166
- Do it now!
- Fuck you, nigga! I'm ready to die.

440
00:25:46,336 --> 00:25:47,701
- I know that guy.
- It's Felix.

441
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,745
- No no, Ricky.
- Shut the hell up!

442
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:51,254
- I'll shoot you and your fucking dog.
- What?

443
00:25:51,425 --> 00:25:53,086
- Fuck you.
- Control that dog before I shoot it.

444
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,921
Three witnesses over here, son.

445
00:25:55,095 --> 00:25:57,381
I run the block!
You feel me?

446
00:25:57,556 --> 00:25:59,888
And I don't need no pussy-ass cops
for this Puerto Rican bitch.

447
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:04,098
Hey, put the gun on the ground
and step away from it! Do it now! Now!

448
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:07,559
I'm Detective Lureu.
What is this?

449
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:09,815
- Trying to figure it out, Officer.
- I'm Morrison.

450
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:12,192
So we come around the corner,
these two come spilling out

451
00:26:12,362 --> 00:26:13,477
of the bodega, arguing.

452
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:15,191
Out of nowhere, the big--
the black guy

453
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:17,321
takes a swing at the little guy
with a knife in his hand.

454
00:26:17,493 --> 00:26:19,950
Little guy pulls a piece,
we draw weapons, you guys show up.

455
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,111
I didn't even see where the gun
came from, it happened so fast.

456
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:25,497
A'ight. I'm gonna take it
from here, uni.

457
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:30,411
Put the gun down.
Put it down.

458
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:32,545
It ain't going bad today, not today.

459
00:26:32,716 --> 00:26:34,957
Put the gun down, buddy.
Come on, put it on the ground.

460
00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:36,796
Right there.

461
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:39,302
Right there on the ground.
Put the gun down.

462
00:26:39,473 --> 00:26:41,088
All right, it's your turn.

463
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:43,552
Hey hey! You next, let's go.
Tie the dog up,

464
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:45,263
- lay on the street. Let's go.
- Fuck you!

465
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:47,473
If it's all the same to you, Officer,
I'll take it from here.

466
00:26:47,648 --> 00:26:49,388
No, it's my collar, my cuffs. No.

467
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:51,773
Officer Burke's got rank here,
he decides.

468
00:26:51,944 --> 00:26:53,900
He's looking at me
like he wants to eat me.

469
00:26:54,071 --> 00:26:56,312
I want this monkey in my car,
my cuffs on him.

470
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:58,355
I'm not asking you.
I'm telling you.

471
00:27:00,911 --> 00:27:04,074
Partner, draw your weapon
on Officer Redneck over here.

472
00:27:04,248 --> 00:27:07,081
Right now, do it.

473
00:27:07,251 --> 00:27:10,493
You out of your fucking mind?
The fuck you doing?

474
00:27:11,547 --> 00:27:12,662
I'm in control here.

475
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,000
You holster your weapon

476
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:16,039
or my partner's gonna
shoot you where you stand.

477
00:27:16,218 --> 00:27:18,083
You wanna die?
You wanna die?

478
00:27:18,262 --> 00:27:20,469
- Billy, I think--
- Shut the fuck up!

479
00:27:22,015 --> 00:27:23,505
You wanna die?

480
00:27:31,692 --> 00:27:34,024
Tie your dog on the--
on the pole over there.

481
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:36,185
I want you to turn around
and I want you to kneel down

482
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:38,729
and interlock your fingers
behind your head.

483
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:42,741
Take the kid over here,
then you hand him over to Officer Burke.

484
00:27:46,582 --> 00:27:48,243
Let's go. On your knees.

485
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:51,500
On your knees!
Hands behind your head.

486
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:53,035
Do it now!

487
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:55,329
- Hey hey hey.
- Tough guy, huh?

488
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:57,463
You're lucky I didn't
haul your ass off, punk.

489
00:27:58,468 --> 00:27:59,924
Hey!

490
00:28:01,263 --> 00:28:04,050
- Oh my God!
- What's up now, pussy? Huh?

491
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:06,886
- I ain't even do nothing, son.
- Fuck.

492
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:09,392
This motherfucker wanna eat me.
You think I'm a monkey, huh?

493
00:28:09,563 --> 00:28:12,270
Ricky, you know me, man.
Don't do this.

494
00:28:12,441 --> 00:28:14,682
Don't test me, Malo.
Don't test me.

495
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:17,192
You're right--
dude wants to end you.

496
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:18,772
I ain't gonna let it go like that.

497
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:21,438
Easy, let the OG take you in.

498
00:28:21,617 --> 00:28:24,154
Put the gun down.
Come on, son.

499
00:28:24,328 --> 00:28:26,569
It's gonna get bad for you out here.

500
00:28:35,047 --> 00:28:36,753
You oughta be locking up that cop!

501
00:28:36,924 --> 00:28:38,130
You're welcome.

502
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,837
On your knees. Let's go.

503
00:28:41,011 --> 00:28:42,342
- On your knees.
- Hey.

504
00:28:42,512 --> 00:28:44,468
- Easy.
- Hands behind your head.

505
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:47,426
Hands behind your head!

506
00:28:52,314 --> 00:28:54,976
Hey hey hey!

507
00:28:59,613 --> 00:29:01,103
Stand down.

508
00:29:04,201 --> 00:29:05,611
They're not messing around.

509
00:29:05,786 --> 00:29:08,027
Don't think I'm not
reporting this, Lureu.

510
00:29:08,205 --> 00:29:09,661
Yeah, we all watched you
assault a perp

511
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:11,867
and my rookie bail
your bitch-ass out,

512
00:29:12,042 --> 00:29:13,452
so why don't you put that
in your report?

513
00:29:13,627 --> 00:29:15,868
You're mine.
Get in the fucking cruiser.

514
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:22,423
Punk.

515
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:36,058
Do me a favor--
uncuff him, will you?

516
00:29:37,818 --> 00:29:39,274
Uncuff him.

517
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:41,150
- Do you really want me to?
- Yeah.

518
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:47,816
- He's my new partner Malo.
- 'Sup?

519
00:29:47,995 --> 00:29:50,111
- Yeah.
- You carrying?

520
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:51,950
Of course, Lureu.
You know I always got you.

521
00:29:52,124 --> 00:29:54,080
You lucky that I showed up when I did,
'cause you know

522
00:29:54,251 --> 00:29:55,957
that redneck was gonna
rape you with a stick.

523
00:29:56,128 --> 00:29:58,210
You know that, right?

524
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:01,543
All right, you owe me.

525
00:30:01,717 --> 00:30:04,504
This your stop. Get out.

526
00:30:08,682 --> 00:30:11,765
- You sure you don't party?
- Not with that shit.

527
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:14,426
Yeah well,

528
00:30:14,604 --> 00:30:17,220
when you've seen enough shit
and you've done enough shit,

529
00:30:18,275 --> 00:30:19,765
you change your mind.

530
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:22,355
Till then, don't judge me
if you're gonna be

531
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:24,861
- sitting right next to me.
- I'm not judging you.

532
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:27,981
You will soon.

533
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:33,995
Just once I'd like to know
what it feels like

534
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:36,373
not to have a brown face
in the back back there.

535
00:30:36,543 --> 00:30:40,331
Now your mama gotta hide her face every
time she go out on the street, huh?

536
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:42,211
Uncuff him, Officer.

537
00:30:42,382 --> 00:30:43,838
Excuse me?

538
00:30:44,009 --> 00:30:46,546
I said take the shackles
off the young boy's wrists.

539
00:30:51,391 --> 00:30:54,724
And give this to him.
It's his stuff.

540
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:03,767
Come on, man.

541
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:06,561
And look,
keep your head on you, okay?

542
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:10,198
- We're letting you off this time.
- Hey, come on.

543
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:14,111
It ain't always gonna be like this.

544
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:21,751
Wow.

545
00:31:21,922 --> 00:31:24,664
I thought we were supposed
to keep cats like that off the streets.

546
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:26,251
- No.
- You know, I thought that--

547
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:28,587
No no, tell me,
what would you have done, Officer,

548
00:31:28,762 --> 00:31:30,423
if you had six guns
pointed at your head

549
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:33,304
and a crazy-ass cracker
trying to take you in? Huh?

550
00:31:33,475 --> 00:31:35,932
- Remember Abner Louima.
- Why did we let him go?

551
00:31:36,103 --> 00:31:38,640
- I mean, he--
- No, he's gonna be better off

552
00:31:38,814 --> 00:31:41,601
out here than he is inside that system.
Trust me on that.

553
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:45,104
But that's not
our decision to make, sir.

554
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:47,109
- No. Look, let me tell you something.
- You know, that's--

555
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,861
A few years inside that system

556
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:50,897
and he would've
been desperate enough

557
00:31:51,076 --> 00:31:53,488
to pull that trigger
just not to go back inside.

558
00:31:54,955 --> 00:31:57,037
Now this lesson just ain't for him.

559
00:31:57,207 --> 00:31:59,038
It's for you too.

560
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:04,290
Yes sir.

561
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:19,635
I'm getting money,
yeah, I'm getting money

562
00:32:19,813 --> 00:32:23,021
You niggas 'bout a dollar,
I'm 'bout a hundred

563
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:25,933
I'm getting money,
yeah, I'm getting money

564
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:30,730
Mr. Hundred Grand, popping them
dollars out of rubber bands

565
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:33,398
I'm getting money,
l-l-l-- I'm getting money

566
00:32:33,577 --> 00:32:36,660
I'm getting money, l-l-l--
I'm getting money

567
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:39,993
I'm getting money,
l-l-l-- I'm getting money

568
00:32:40,167 --> 00:32:42,499
I'm getting money, l-l-l--
I'm getting money...

569
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:45,661
Cash on delivery,
they call me the Postman

570
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:47,500
I'm a stunner,
bread and butter...

571
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:49,255
You tap Joey yet?

572
00:32:50,302 --> 00:32:51,758
What?

573
00:32:51,928 --> 00:32:54,670
Joey, the bartender?

574
00:32:54,848 --> 00:32:56,429
I only met her a week ago.

575
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,591
Did you tap Joey yet?

576
00:33:01,271 --> 00:33:02,807
Of course I did.

577
00:33:04,774 --> 00:33:06,264
I knew that shit. Punks.

578
00:33:06,443 --> 00:33:08,855
Everybody in that bar been trying
to crack that ass ever since

579
00:33:09,029 --> 00:33:11,111
she got up in here.
Then you come in here in a week,

580
00:33:11,281 --> 00:33:13,522
slinging your shit around
and you got that.

581
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:16,112
A couple stacks
in my religious

582
00:33:16,286 --> 00:33:17,992
To help my jeans sag

583
00:33:18,163 --> 00:33:20,996
The chain so icy,
the kid playing freeze tag

584
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:24,078
She say she like my swag,
I think she got it bad...

585
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:26,368
Whoa whoa,
what we got up here?

586
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:30,960
- Let me get that.
- Sit down, rookie.

587
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:33,250
I'll make the first move,
then you show me what you've got.

588
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:43,013
Ladies.

589
00:33:43,188 --> 00:33:45,179
You lose your keys?

590
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:48,102
Shit, I know you ain't trying to holla.

591
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:50,562
Y'all are too fine to be police, baby.

592
00:33:50,737 --> 00:33:53,228
- What's going on, ladies?
- Her man crazy.

593
00:33:53,406 --> 00:33:55,146
- He ain't my man.
- Your man crazy?

594
00:33:55,325 --> 00:33:58,442
Yeah, so we was out here
last night just chilling,

595
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:01,077
smoking a blunt.
So I need to holla at my man,

596
00:34:01,248 --> 00:34:02,579
but my phone battery had died,

597
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:04,785
so I ask Eddie can I use his.

598
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,541
So he let me use it,
but then he's stressing me

599
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:08,793
on these minutes and shit, right?
So we got to yelling.

600
00:34:08,964 --> 00:34:11,330
Then po-po rolls up, talking about
disturbing the peace and shit

601
00:34:11,508 --> 00:34:12,839
and that they about to take us in.

602
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:14,874
Anyhow, Eddie got put
in the system last night,

603
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:17,339
got locked up with the key to this house
and my shit's still in there.

604
00:34:17,514 --> 00:34:19,175
You know what?
Enough of that, a'ight?

605
00:34:19,349 --> 00:34:21,761
- Show me some lD.
- What you want my lD for?

606
00:34:21,935 --> 00:34:23,266
Just give me some lD, all right?

607
00:34:23,436 --> 00:34:25,176
Hey, shit.

608
00:34:26,273 --> 00:34:27,934
Here.

609
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:32,100
What does Eddie do?
Eddie sling rock?

610
00:34:34,698 --> 00:34:36,654
Answer my partner.

611
00:34:36,825 --> 00:34:38,941
No, Eddie sells weed.

612
00:34:47,586 --> 00:34:51,329
There's somethin' in here.
You smell it?

613
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,132
- Get your shit and get outta here.
- Hey, gimme a fucking minute.

614
00:34:56,303 --> 00:34:57,509
Wait a motherfucking minute? Shit.

615
00:34:57,679 --> 00:34:59,294
Make sure these ladies
get outta here, a'ight?

616
00:34:59,472 --> 00:35:01,133
God.

617
00:35:01,308 --> 00:35:03,890
- Just a minute.
- Just get your shit and let's go.

618
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:06,016
God damn it.

619
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:11,021
Where is my fuckin'--?

620
00:35:11,192 --> 00:35:13,023
I don't fucking know.
Maybe he took it.

621
00:35:13,194 --> 00:35:14,934
Yeah yeah,
I don't see my shit. Any of it.

622
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:16,603
Am I fucking seeing
my man's shit, anyway?

623
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:18,567
I thought you said
Eddie wasn't your man?

624
00:35:18,742 --> 00:35:20,232
Okay, all right, look--

625
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:21,991
Hey, man, what the fuck you doing?

626
00:35:25,081 --> 00:35:26,366
Oh shit.

627
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:28,077
Oh shit.
I'm not gonna tell.

628
00:35:28,251 --> 00:35:30,492
I ain't gonna say nothing.
I swear I'm not.

629
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:33,207
She ran off with your balls, kid.

630
00:35:34,591 --> 00:35:36,673
Help me!

631
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:47,429
Oh, no no!

632
00:35:50,023 --> 00:35:51,263
Please!

633
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:56,192
Holy shit. Shit.

634
00:36:05,705 --> 00:36:08,037
Grandma, is she dead?

635
00:36:10,919 --> 00:36:13,001
Move back.

636
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:14,877
Somebody call 91 1.

637
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:25,217
First time seeing a face get split?

638
00:36:25,392 --> 00:36:26,552
No.

639
00:36:28,395 --> 00:36:31,683
Here's your cut plus

640
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:36,065
a little cherry-popping bonus.

641
00:36:37,487 --> 00:36:39,569
Another good day.

642
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:43,356
- How about my cut of the weed?
- Yo.

643
00:36:43,535 --> 00:36:45,742
No no, we'll sell Eddie's stash
to one of his competitors,

644
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:48,654
we make a bundle of cash-- unless you've
got a better idea. I'm all ears.

645
00:36:48,832 --> 00:36:51,073
Let's bail Eddie out,
sell his product back to him.

646
00:36:51,251 --> 00:36:52,957
We put him back in business
working for us,

647
00:36:53,128 --> 00:36:55,210
take a cut off the top.
Win-win for everybody.

648
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:56,995
You know,
I was right about you.

649
00:36:57,173 --> 00:36:59,164
You're charmed.
I love this kid.

650
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:00,923
Today was a good day.

651
00:37:01,094 --> 00:37:03,301
You guys go out,
have a good time, celebrate.

652
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:25,690
Welcome to my shade, here.

653
00:37:25,869 --> 00:37:27,905
- This is your spot?
- This is it.

654
00:37:30,415 --> 00:37:33,498
"D" is for the diamonds,
"O" is for the owes

655
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:36,660
"P" is for the paper,
"E" is for everything...

656
00:37:36,838 --> 00:37:38,248
Hi.

657
00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:41,338
Take a seat, all right? Relax.

658
00:37:44,804 --> 00:37:46,715
Hi.

659
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:49,597
I see you brought a friend.
To the back.

660
00:37:49,768 --> 00:37:51,304
I'll get you set up.

661
00:37:52,562 --> 00:37:55,520
Oh. Enjoy, a'ight?
It's on me.

662
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:59,558
Thank you very much,
you are very welcome

663
00:37:59,736 --> 00:38:02,694
For not supporting
and never helping

664
00:38:02,864 --> 00:38:05,822
I live the dream, so when I sleep
there's only nightmares...

665
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:07,072
- Thanks.
- Like when the police found

666
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:09,199
That cocaine in my Nike Airs

667
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:12,328
I went from steel handcuffs
to diamond bracelets

668
00:38:12,499 --> 00:38:14,080
When no one else
would bail me out

669
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:15,865
My nigga Johnny Blaze did

670
00:38:16,044 --> 00:38:18,660
That's why I take him
everywhere with me

671
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:20,954
Even let him blow my last 50

672
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:22,668
No problem

673
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:25,208
On my way to heaven
to fuck your goddess

674
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:28,594
And if we ever go broke,
pray to the snow gods

675
00:38:28,765 --> 00:38:31,222
Here go some money, baby,
have a good time

676
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:33,974
I gotta go change the world
one pound at a time

677
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:36,352
Selling dope,
"D" is for the diamonds

678
00:38:36,523 --> 00:38:38,684
"O" is for the owes

679
00:38:38,858 --> 00:38:41,474
"P" is for the paper,
"E" is for everything

680
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:44,861
Dope gave me everything

681
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:48,068
Dope, thanks for everything

682
00:38:48,243 --> 00:38:51,201
"D" is for the diamonds,
"O" is for the owes

683
00:38:51,371 --> 00:38:54,534
"P" is for the paper,
"E" is for everything

684
00:38:54,707 --> 00:38:57,824
Dope, you gave me everything

685
00:38:58,002 --> 00:39:01,369
Dope,
thanks for everything.

686
00:39:27,156 --> 00:39:28,942
I like driving around with you, Pop.

687
00:39:29,117 --> 00:39:30,778
Yeah, I bet you do.

688
00:39:40,169 --> 00:39:41,534
Show me your hands.

689
00:39:42,672 --> 00:39:44,378
It's dead out here.

690
00:39:44,549 --> 00:39:46,289
We got a little carried away.

691
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:48,674
We didn't mean any harm.

692
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:51,590
- Have a safe night.
- Jonas,

693
00:39:51,764 --> 00:39:53,345
you know what your pop
does for a living, right?

694
00:39:53,516 --> 00:39:55,598
You're a good guy, Pop.

695
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:58,384
That's right.
This badge makes me bulletproof.

696
00:40:00,773 --> 00:40:03,389
In this life, sometimes you gotta
take what should be given.

697
00:40:03,568 --> 00:40:04,774
You understand?

698
00:40:04,944 --> 00:40:07,731
Always keep sock money
around for a rainy day.

699
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:17,411
Come on in.

700
00:40:21,002 --> 00:40:22,458
You want that respect?

701
00:40:22,629 --> 00:40:24,244
It's not about the power,
it's about the form.

702
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:26,629
Practice makes perfect here.

703
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:29,336
There you go.
that's nice for-- whoa!

704
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:32,377
Oh! What's going on, man?

705
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:34,591
What's up? Yo, what's up?
What's going on?

706
00:40:34,766 --> 00:40:36,472
- What y'all doing over here?
- Everything good?

707
00:40:36,643 --> 00:40:38,179
- Yeah yeah.
- Hey, watch your elbow, man.

708
00:40:38,353 --> 00:40:40,014
You gotta make sure
he get the forms right.

709
00:40:40,188 --> 00:40:41,519
Hey hey, listen to this man.

710
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:43,270
He was a dope QB in high school.

711
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:44,851
Yo, this is so you right now.

712
00:40:45,026 --> 00:40:47,984
It feels good.
Hey, let's get out of this sun, man.

713
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:53,072
- Oof.
- It's hot out there.

714
00:40:54,661 --> 00:40:56,777
Yo, remember when
we used to get out of doing laps

715
00:40:56,955 --> 00:40:59,492
by bribing Coach Bishop with bagels
from Cyn's dad's diner?

716
00:40:59,666 --> 00:41:01,827
Yo yo, actually, speaking of Cyn,

717
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:03,741
- you talk to her lately?
- Nah, I ain't speak to her.

718
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,660
Yo, all I know

719
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:07,544
is that your TO is fucking crazy.

720
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:09,046
- Look who talking.
- Yeah.

721
00:41:09,217 --> 00:41:11,048
Yo, would you have

722
00:41:11,219 --> 00:41:13,210
really shot Morrison
if your TO told you to?

723
00:41:13,388 --> 00:41:16,130
Man, y'all got no idea
what goes on in my squad.

724
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:18,923
Dudes is eating,
and they're getting real money.

725
00:41:19,102 --> 00:41:21,468
People in the mayor's office
answer my boss's calls.

726
00:41:21,646 --> 00:41:24,729
- The shit is crazy.
- I thought we were supposed to be

727
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:26,981
- each other's eyes, ears and fists.
- Mm-hmm.

728
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:28,857
That's why I gotta
get y'all on this squad.

729
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:30,859
Yo, can you please
make that happen

730
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:32,895
before my crazy TO gets me killed?

731
00:41:33,074 --> 00:41:34,780
Yeah, I'm down.

732
00:41:34,951 --> 00:41:37,784
I'm heading over there later.
Lemme see what I can do.

733
00:41:55,638 --> 00:41:56,969
Yo, lemme get some.

734
00:42:05,148 --> 00:42:08,015
Yo, I guess you didn't get the message
the last time, you little bitch.

735
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:09,898
Oh shit!

736
00:42:16,451 --> 00:42:17,987
Oh shit!

737
00:42:26,836 --> 00:42:28,451
Fuck.

738
00:42:43,311 --> 00:42:44,767
Hyah!

739
00:43:26,646 --> 00:43:28,386
Fuck you!

740
00:43:53,172 --> 00:43:54,628
Get up.

741
00:44:04,767 --> 00:44:06,598
I'm doing right by this kid, right?

742
00:44:06,769 --> 00:44:09,806
Yeah, you doing right by him.
I understand.

743
00:44:09,981 --> 00:44:12,438
Having junior around helps
keep your conscience clean.

744
00:44:13,985 --> 00:44:16,317
You trust him, all right?

745
00:44:19,365 --> 00:44:22,528
- Hey, what's that?
- Homework.

746
00:44:22,702 --> 00:44:26,536
John Jay, student,
criminal psychology.

747
00:44:26,706 --> 00:44:28,742
Do you remember anything?

748
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:30,452
No.

749
00:44:32,962 --> 00:44:35,044
- I wanna test him.
- Yeah?

750
00:44:35,214 --> 00:44:36,875
Just give him something to do,
give him something small.

751
00:44:37,049 --> 00:44:40,382
- Something small? Yeah. Mmm.
- Yeah.

752
00:44:41,429 --> 00:44:43,135
This is why I don't date cops.

753
00:44:43,306 --> 00:44:45,388
They're too self-absorbed.

754
00:44:45,558 --> 00:44:46,718
- What?
- Nothing.

755
00:44:52,481 --> 00:44:55,223
So you arresting thugs
on the street now?

756
00:44:55,401 --> 00:44:57,562
You can't call yourself a man
and deal drugs to children

757
00:44:57,737 --> 00:45:00,228
and mothers pushing strollers.

758
00:45:00,406 --> 00:45:01,896
That's a piece of shit.

759
00:45:03,201 --> 00:45:05,738
You calling me a piece of shit now?

760
00:45:08,748 --> 00:45:10,909
Huh? Ah!

761
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:12,289
I'm fucking with you.

762
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:14,917
But don't fuck
with our representatives

763
00:45:15,087 --> 00:45:16,873
on the street--
that's most important.

764
00:45:17,048 --> 00:45:18,163
- Huh?
- Cool.

765
00:45:18,341 --> 00:45:19,421
You want a chance to move up?

766
00:45:19,592 --> 00:45:21,503
No doubt. You know that.

767
00:45:21,677 --> 00:45:23,338
Go here...

768
00:45:24,388 --> 00:45:25,969
come back with my money.

769
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:27,676
You mind if I bring my boys with me?

770
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:28,965
That's how we do it here.

771
00:45:30,144 --> 00:45:31,680
You vouch for 'em, sure, it's okay.

772
00:45:31,854 --> 00:45:33,936
- They're like my brothers.
- Okay.

773
00:45:34,106 --> 00:45:36,267
It's the first time
you're gonna meet this guy.

774
00:45:36,442 --> 00:45:39,275
I want you to lean on him
and be felt. Understood?

775
00:45:39,445 --> 00:45:40,605
Yes sir.

776
00:45:41,697 --> 00:45:43,233
Important.

777
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:46,649
- Go ahead.
- Whoa whoa whoa whoa.

778
00:45:46,827 --> 00:45:48,818
You ready, Malo?

779
00:45:50,122 --> 00:45:51,282
Go ahead. Go go.

780
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:08,588
Hold the fuck on!

781
00:46:12,353 --> 00:46:14,514
Ah!

782
00:46:16,983 --> 00:46:19,816
Oh fuck!

783
00:46:19,986 --> 00:46:22,352
- Whoa, fucking slow down.
- You Sully?

784
00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:24,771
- Yeah, I'm Sully.
- G'day, mate.

785
00:46:24,949 --> 00:46:27,440
Do I look like a fucking kangaroo
to you, you prick?

786
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:30,325
- Who the fuck are you guys?
- We're the new crew.

787
00:46:30,496 --> 00:46:32,077
- Is that right?
- Whoa whoa whoa.

788
00:46:32,248 --> 00:46:34,159
- Easy easy now.
- I wish you would.

789
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:36,699
Whoa.

790
00:46:36,877 --> 00:46:39,539
We're here to collect Sarcone's money.

791
00:46:39,714 --> 00:46:41,329
Sarcone.

792
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:45,170
- Where's Lureu?
- Like the man said,

793
00:46:45,344 --> 00:46:48,006
- we're the new crew.
- Just tell us where the money's at.

794
00:46:49,348 --> 00:46:51,088
On the table.

795
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:00,932
Yeah, we good.
Let's get out of here.

796
00:47:01,110 --> 00:47:03,692
- Listen to your partner.
- Or what?

797
00:47:05,698 --> 00:47:07,939
Or I'm gonna get really pissed.

798
00:47:08,117 --> 00:47:10,733
You ain't scared, huh?

799
00:47:10,911 --> 00:47:13,527
Are you some kind of tough guy?
You hiding something from Joe?

800
00:47:13,706 --> 00:47:15,867
I ain't hiding nothing

801
00:47:16,042 --> 00:47:17,873
and I've got too much
on Sarcone to worry about him.

802
00:47:18,044 --> 00:47:19,784
So let me tell you this:.

803
00:47:19,962 --> 00:47:21,873
fuck you, fuck you

804
00:47:22,048 --> 00:47:23,538
and fuck you!

805
00:47:28,846 --> 00:47:31,588
Oh shit! You're gonna go
fucking down, you fuckers!

806
00:47:31,766 --> 00:47:33,927
- You're gonna pay for that!
- Come on, grab his foot!

807
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:36,638
- Get me up, you motherfuckers!
- Are you scared yet, motherfucker?

808
00:47:36,812 --> 00:47:38,894
I'm scared for you.

809
00:47:39,065 --> 00:47:41,147
- You gonna fly, motherfucker!
- I'm gonna drop your ass.

810
00:47:41,317 --> 00:47:43,478
- You ain't talking shit now.
- Get me up, you fuckers!

811
00:47:43,652 --> 00:47:45,392
- You ain't talking shit now, right?
- You motherfuckers!

812
00:47:45,571 --> 00:47:47,653
Help me get him in.
Get your ass over here.

813
00:47:47,823 --> 00:47:49,814
You gonna tell me why
you ain't scared of Sarcone,

814
00:47:49,992 --> 00:47:52,278
or I'm gonna fly your ass
out that window like a kite.

815
00:47:53,287 --> 00:47:55,118
I'm more worried about Baez.

816
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:56,745
Who?

817
00:47:58,334 --> 00:48:00,950
You work for Sarcone,
but you don't know who the real boss is.

818
00:48:01,128 --> 00:48:03,995
His boss, my boss, your boss--

819
00:48:04,173 --> 00:48:06,084
Gabriel Baez.

820
00:48:07,301 --> 00:48:09,587
What you know about Sarcone--
times it by 1 0,

821
00:48:09,762 --> 00:48:11,718
don't even come close to Baez.

822
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:14,551
- Sarcone got a handler?
- Everyone's got a boss.

823
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:18,217
Baez has been importing product
into the city for 20 years.

824
00:48:18,396 --> 00:48:21,809
He pays Joe to make sure the traffic
route is all nice and friendly.

825
00:48:21,982 --> 00:48:24,268
Joe used to be the escort.

826
00:48:24,443 --> 00:48:27,810
That's my job now.
I pay him on the back end.

827
00:48:27,988 --> 00:48:30,229
I know spots
of cash that Sarcone--

828
00:48:30,408 --> 00:48:32,945
- he doesn't even know about.
- Go check the other room.

829
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:35,906
- You keep talking.
- A few years back

830
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:39,538
a Queen's ADA tried
to put the squeeze on Joe.

831
00:48:39,708 --> 00:48:42,120
Even got an old cop to rat on him.

832
00:48:43,629 --> 00:48:44,914
It didn't stick.

833
00:48:45,089 --> 00:48:46,750
He's still walking the streets.

834
00:48:46,924 --> 00:48:48,460
The aftermath--

835
00:48:48,634 --> 00:48:50,374
everybody that was involved

836
00:48:50,553 --> 00:48:53,044
- went to an early grave.
- You a cop?

837
00:48:53,222 --> 00:48:56,089
No. You just don't get it.

838
00:48:56,267 --> 00:48:59,009
You're his new trained dog.

839
00:49:00,855 --> 00:49:03,267
He'll get you used
to the white powder.

840
00:49:04,817 --> 00:49:07,524
And he'll use you just like
he has all his other dogs.

841
00:49:09,572 --> 00:49:11,654
And you thought Joe was your friend.

842
00:49:11,824 --> 00:49:13,906
Jackpot, baby.

843
00:49:15,995 --> 00:49:19,032
This ain't the half of it.
Who does this belong to?

844
00:49:20,082 --> 00:49:21,492
Technically, my boss.

845
00:49:21,667 --> 00:49:24,329
If he's skimming from Baez
and hiding it from Sarcone,

846
00:49:24,503 --> 00:49:26,710
then that's none
of our business, Malo.

847
00:49:26,881 --> 00:49:28,917
Come on,
we did what we came to do.

848
00:49:29,091 --> 00:49:30,877
Man, let's get out of here.

849
00:49:31,051 --> 00:49:33,212
Hold on, hold on, hold on.
New deal-- you're gonna tell me

850
00:49:33,387 --> 00:49:34,877
where those cash spots is at,
you hear me?

851
00:49:35,055 --> 00:49:37,967
Or I'm gonna tell Sarcone
about your new little side hustle,

852
00:49:38,142 --> 00:49:40,303
and you already know
what he gonna do.

853
00:49:41,395 --> 00:49:42,680
You work for me now.

854
00:49:56,368 --> 00:49:58,859
Here's the money from Sully.

855
00:49:59,038 --> 00:50:02,326
What's the worst thing
you ever did, Joe?

856
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:05,367
The worst thing I ever did
was trust the wrong man.

857
00:50:07,546 --> 00:50:09,832
How do you know when
you trusting the wrong man?

858
00:50:11,592 --> 00:50:12,581
You're questioning me?

859
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:15,046
Huh? You little shit.

860
00:50:15,221 --> 00:50:18,304
I always made my decision
with my head, not my heart.

861
00:50:18,474 --> 00:50:20,681
I got to where I am in this world
by taking advantage

862
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:22,967
of people's trust,
and I'm not ashamed of that.

863
00:50:24,230 --> 00:50:26,812
I have a question for you.
Are your boys loyal to you?

864
00:50:26,982 --> 00:50:29,268
- Absolutely.
- Yeah?

865
00:50:30,569 --> 00:50:32,150
I'm not asking you
to vouch for them.

866
00:50:32,321 --> 00:50:34,403
I'm asking for you
to bet your balls, literally.

867
00:50:34,573 --> 00:50:36,734
- I understand. I do.
- Yeah, do you?

868
00:50:36,909 --> 00:50:38,820
'Cause usually
it's the guy closest to your balls

869
00:50:38,994 --> 00:50:40,655
who winds up kicking you in them.

870
00:50:40,829 --> 00:50:42,239
I have a rat inside these walls.

871
00:50:42,414 --> 00:50:44,700
That's the news straight
from One Police Plaza.

872
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:46,831
Someone in my confidence
is cheating on me.

873
00:50:47,002 --> 00:50:49,584
Don't make me wrong to trust you.

874
00:50:53,092 --> 00:50:56,880
I love you like a son,
but if you or anybody near you

875
00:50:57,054 --> 00:50:58,590
double-crosses me...

876
00:51:00,015 --> 00:51:01,721
as long as I have breath in my lungs,

877
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:04,508
I will find you and I will cook you.

878
00:51:04,687 --> 00:51:07,394
- You don't have to worry about me.
- I'm not worried, kid.

879
00:51:07,565 --> 00:51:09,271
You're confusing worry and concern.

880
00:51:09,441 --> 00:51:12,148
Sometimes it's a woman who winds up
kicking you in the balls the hardest.

881
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:14,776
- Is that why you're not married?
- You're damn straight.

882
00:51:14,947 --> 00:51:16,608
I don't trust no bitch,
neither should you,

883
00:51:16,782 --> 00:51:19,114
especially not some bitch shaking
her ass for tips in a fucking bar.

884
00:51:19,285 --> 00:51:21,742
- Understood.
- You gotta do what you gotta do, kid.

885
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:25,200
Use your head, always, and keep
your balls covered. Remember that.

886
00:51:26,375 --> 00:51:28,616
- Am I clear?
- I hear you loud and clear.

887
00:51:52,443 --> 00:51:54,980
- Shots!
- You got it.

888
00:51:56,113 --> 00:51:58,775
Yo, what's the word?
Are we in or what?

889
00:51:58,949 --> 00:52:01,440
Sarcone'll get at me
when he's ready, man.

890
00:52:01,619 --> 00:52:03,610
- Don't stress it.
- Yo, that thing Sully said

891
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:05,698
- about an ADA from Queens--
- Yeah?

892
00:52:05,873 --> 00:52:07,738
--what are the chances
he was talking about Vecchio?

893
00:52:07,916 --> 00:52:10,373
- Who the fuck cares?
- Gimme two.

894
00:52:10,544 --> 00:52:12,660
If it's true, Sarcone and Baez

895
00:52:12,838 --> 00:52:14,794
got more to lose by not bringing us on.

896
00:52:14,965 --> 00:52:16,546
Am I right?

897
00:52:16,717 --> 00:52:18,708
I'll talk to Lydia tomorrow,
see what's up.

898
00:52:18,886 --> 00:52:22,174
Yo, I seen this fly Spanish girl. Whoa!

899
00:52:23,932 --> 00:52:25,593
Yo, what's up with Cyn, man?

900
00:52:25,768 --> 00:52:28,384
You talk to her lately?
Now you know she loves you.

901
00:52:28,562 --> 00:52:30,974
How long you gonna make her pay
for her family's bullshit?

902
00:52:31,148 --> 00:52:33,355
Look, man,
Cyn's doing Cyn.

903
00:52:33,525 --> 00:52:35,015
Me? I'm doing me.

904
00:52:35,194 --> 00:52:37,059
Let's move.

905
00:52:57,675 --> 00:53:00,838
Yeah, whatever.
But just-- you know, just in case.

906
00:53:01,011 --> 00:53:04,549
Hey. How you doing?

907
00:53:05,933 --> 00:53:08,549
- I'm good. How are you?
- I'm good.

908
00:53:08,727 --> 00:53:10,513
You come here with these clowns?

909
00:53:10,688 --> 00:53:13,680
No, my girlfriend knows
one of the guys.

910
00:53:13,857 --> 00:53:16,223
I just met them.
Is that okay?

911
00:53:16,402 --> 00:53:17,391
Yo, do I know you?

912
00:53:19,196 --> 00:53:20,436
Yo, I'm talking to you.

913
00:53:24,535 --> 00:53:26,275
- No, son, you don't know me.
- Wanna party?

914
00:53:29,415 --> 00:53:33,499
- Ooh. A cop, huh?
- What the fuck?

915
00:53:33,669 --> 00:53:37,002
Shit. His motherfucking badge
don't mean shit in here.

916
00:53:38,966 --> 00:53:40,251
I think she liked it.

917
00:53:48,809 --> 00:53:51,596
- Yo, who invited you here?
- Man, fuck you.

918
00:53:51,770 --> 00:53:54,011
What?! Who the fuck you think
you're talking to?

919
00:53:54,189 --> 00:53:55,178
- Whoa.
- Coming in here with that badge,

920
00:53:55,357 --> 00:53:56,847
thinking you running shit?

921
00:53:57,025 --> 00:53:58,356
- I gotta go.
- You a punk, huh?

922
00:53:58,527 --> 00:54:00,063
You scared? You nervous?

923
00:54:02,406 --> 00:54:04,237
You nervous?!

924
00:54:04,408 --> 00:54:05,898
- Oh shit!
- Pop off!

925
00:54:06,076 --> 00:54:07,816
Why you pulling the gun, white boy?

926
00:54:07,995 --> 00:54:09,531
We all got guns.
Pop off!

927
00:54:09,705 --> 00:54:11,491
- You nervous?!
- You gonna shoot all of us?

928
00:54:11,665 --> 00:54:14,407
- You scared, white boy?
- You gonna shoot all of us?

929
00:54:18,046 --> 00:54:19,536
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!

930
00:54:19,715 --> 00:54:21,421
- Police! Get the fuck down!
- What did you do?

931
00:54:21,592 --> 00:54:23,878
What the fuck?
Man, put this shit down. What the--

932
00:54:24,052 --> 00:54:26,043
Stupid, man.
We gotta get outta here.

933
00:54:26,221 --> 00:54:28,678
- Come on, man, get out of here.
- Yeah, fuck you!

934
00:54:28,849 --> 00:54:31,340
- Let's go! Let's go! Come on!
- Fuck you!

935
00:54:37,608 --> 00:54:39,815
- What do we do?
- What they gonna do?

936
00:54:39,985 --> 00:54:41,065
They gonna--
they gonna call the cops?

937
00:54:41,236 --> 00:54:43,397
Hey, man,
he's outta control, man.

938
00:54:43,572 --> 00:54:44,937
It's always the same shit
with this dude.

939
00:55:24,488 --> 00:55:26,274
Mix some up.

940
00:55:28,325 --> 00:55:29,815
You really think
I wouldn't have found out

941
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:31,824
about your boy shooting
two people at a party?

942
00:55:31,995 --> 00:55:34,031
In front of witnesses? Huh?

943
00:55:34,206 --> 00:55:36,162
- Huh?
- Answer the man.

944
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:38,198
Your fucking boy's an idiot.

945
00:55:38,377 --> 00:55:40,834
He's a fucking idiot.
You understand that?

946
00:55:41,004 --> 00:55:42,619
He ain't under
my protection like you.

947
00:55:42,798 --> 00:55:44,914
He can get you fucked up.
He can fuck me up.

948
00:55:45,092 --> 00:55:47,629
- He got excited. I'll calm him down.
- He got excited?

949
00:55:47,803 --> 00:55:49,384
He got excited?

950
00:55:52,057 --> 00:55:54,093
I made some calls.
Last night never happened.

951
00:55:54,268 --> 00:55:57,385
I like you, Malo.
Up until now I trusted your judgment.

952
00:55:57,563 --> 00:55:59,519
I know you want him around
because he's your friend,

953
00:55:59,690 --> 00:56:01,146
but if I ever hear
of him fucking up again,

954
00:56:01,316 --> 00:56:03,432
that's it.
It's over.

955
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:05,475
You understand?

956
00:56:05,654 --> 00:56:07,690
- Let me hear you say it!
- Yes, I understand.

957
00:56:07,865 --> 00:56:10,197
Let me tell you something right now--
you work for me!

958
00:56:10,367 --> 00:56:11,982
Only me, not yourself!

959
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:14,242
You do what I say!

960
00:56:15,247 --> 00:56:16,236
Snort that line.

961
00:56:17,958 --> 00:56:20,199
Snort the fucking line!

962
00:56:28,802 --> 00:56:30,292
The other one.

963
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:37,932
- You just don't get it.
- Your boy's a fucking idiot.

964
00:56:38,103 --> 00:56:39,968
- You're his new trained dog.
- He's a fucking idiot.

965
00:56:40,147 --> 00:56:42,058
That thing Sully said
about an ADA from Queens.

966
00:56:42,232 --> 00:56:43,347
He'll get you used to the white powder.

967
00:56:43,525 --> 00:56:44,605
He ain't under my protection.

968
00:56:44,776 --> 00:56:46,437
What are the chances
he was talking about Vecchio?

969
00:56:46,612 --> 00:56:48,477
He can fuck you up.
He can fuck me up. I like you, Malo.

970
00:56:48,655 --> 00:56:50,236
Up till now, I trusted your judgment.
You work for me!

971
00:56:50,407 --> 00:56:52,318
Only me!
Let me hear you say it.

972
00:56:53,619 --> 00:56:54,859
Get outta here.

973
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,956
This fucking kid.

974
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:26,731
Hey.

975
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:34,147
I knew you'd call eventually.

976
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:37,116
You got your wish.

977
00:57:38,705 --> 00:57:40,661
I appreciate everything
you did for me, Lydia,

978
00:57:40,832 --> 00:57:43,915
but I called because I needed
to talk to you about your husband.

979
00:57:44,086 --> 00:57:46,168
What happened to him?

980
00:57:46,338 --> 00:57:47,748
How'd he die?

981
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:52,256
Kenneth was very ambitious.

982
00:57:53,679 --> 00:57:55,340
He was looking for something big,

983
00:57:55,514 --> 00:57:57,926
something that would
make him a legal rock star.

984
00:57:59,851 --> 00:58:02,092
Then he'd be DA or mayor

985
00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:04,602
or God knows what. Governor?

986
00:58:06,441 --> 00:58:09,729
- So what happened?
- He got what he wanted.

987
00:58:09,903 --> 00:58:12,565
He was approached by a DEA agent

988
00:58:12,739 --> 00:58:14,354
who wanted help in

989
00:58:14,533 --> 00:58:18,651
building a case against
corrupt New York City cops.

990
00:58:18,829 --> 00:58:20,785
Kenneth jumped at the chance.

991
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:23,530
So how'd he die?

992
00:58:23,709 --> 00:58:25,370
Not well.

993
00:58:25,544 --> 00:58:28,035
They called it a no-note suicide.

994
00:58:30,382 --> 00:58:33,340
Not leaving a note
for me I understand, but...

995
00:58:35,721 --> 00:58:38,713
nothing for his son,
his daughter?

996
00:58:38,890 --> 00:58:42,098
No, that's not Kenneth.

997
00:58:44,896 --> 00:58:48,059
I met Agent Robert Jude
at Kenneth's wake.

998
00:58:49,484 --> 00:58:52,442
He showed me what Kenneth kept
locked away in his office--

999
00:58:53,739 --> 00:58:55,104
a dossier

1000
00:58:56,158 --> 00:58:58,695
on one Captain Joseph Sarcone.

1001
00:58:58,869 --> 00:59:01,406
Audio, video surveillance,

1002
00:59:01,580 --> 00:59:05,072
notebooks with names,
dates, locations.

1003
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:08,959
Basically, he was
a drug dealer in a uniform.

1004
00:59:09,129 --> 00:59:11,370
And he had two partners.

1005
00:59:14,259 --> 00:59:15,749
Baby, don't be naive.

1006
00:59:15,927 --> 00:59:18,339
My husband found
your father's weak spot.

1007
00:59:18,513 --> 00:59:20,674
He convinced him
that you were in danger.

1008
00:59:22,517 --> 00:59:25,259
He got him to talk on record about

1009
00:59:25,437 --> 00:59:28,679
Sarcone and all the shit
they'd been involved in.

1010
00:59:30,025 --> 00:59:32,937
That's why my husband
got you into the academy.

1011
00:59:33,111 --> 00:59:35,272
He felt guilty.

1012
00:59:37,449 --> 00:59:38,814
Guilty for what?

1013
00:59:38,992 --> 00:59:42,200
How do you think your father died?

1014
00:59:42,370 --> 00:59:44,452
How do you think Kenneth died?

1015
00:59:45,749 --> 00:59:47,489
Sarcone's not your friend.

1016
00:59:48,585 --> 00:59:50,291
Sarcone's been like a father to me.

1017
00:59:50,462 --> 00:59:52,327
Yeah? How long is that gonna last?

1018
01:00:12,984 --> 01:00:14,520
My name is Daniel Maldonado.

1019
01:00:14,694 --> 01:00:17,356
I'm a detective for the New York City
Police Department.

1020
01:00:18,865 --> 01:00:20,355
And the reason
you've come to us here today?

1021
01:00:20,534 --> 01:00:24,618
My partners
Dennis Lureu and Joe Sarcone,

1022
01:00:24,788 --> 01:00:26,369
and myself,

1023
01:00:26,540 --> 01:00:29,247
work for the drug cartel boss
Gabriel Baez.

1024
01:00:29,417 --> 01:00:31,874
While on duty,
we transported cocaine, marijuana

1025
01:00:32,045 --> 01:00:33,626
and worked as bodyguards
and hired guns

1026
01:00:33,797 --> 01:00:35,253
for Gabriel Baez
for the past seven years.

1027
01:00:35,423 --> 01:00:37,914
And now I'm afraid
for the life of my wife and my son.

1028
01:00:38,093 --> 01:00:40,209
- I love you, Pop.
- I love you too, Jonas.

1029
01:00:40,387 --> 01:00:43,220
If Sarcone found out I was
talking to ADA Vecchio,

1030
01:00:43,390 --> 01:00:46,006
trying to build a case against him,
they'd fucking kill me.

1031
01:00:46,184 --> 01:00:48,300
Climb in the back.
Climb in the back and hide on the floor.

1032
01:00:48,478 --> 01:00:50,434
Come on.
And keep quiet. Not a peep.

1033
01:00:50,605 --> 01:00:53,938
- Oh yo, man. It's you guys.
- Get out of the car.

1034
01:00:54,109 --> 01:00:56,521
Come on, I'm just picking up
a little sock money. It's nothing.

1035
01:00:56,695 --> 01:00:58,185
Don't force my hand here.

1036
01:00:58,363 --> 01:00:59,978
Danny-- you crossed the line, Danny.

1037
01:01:00,157 --> 01:01:01,613
Now get the fuck out of the car.

1038
01:01:02,868 --> 01:01:04,654
Your dad and me were partners.

1039
01:01:05,787 --> 01:01:07,778
I love you like a son.

1040
01:01:07,956 --> 01:01:09,912
If this is about the money,
here, take a piece.

1041
01:01:10,083 --> 01:01:11,869
It's not about the money, Danny.

1042
01:01:12,043 --> 01:01:13,829
If it ain't about the dough,
then what the hell is it about?

1043
01:01:14,004 --> 01:01:15,960
It's about loyalty.

1044
01:01:18,008 --> 01:01:21,421
You son of a bitch.
You son of a bitch.

1045
01:01:21,595 --> 01:01:24,052
Why? Wait! Wait a minute!

1046
01:01:29,936 --> 01:01:32,143
Pop, how can I get you out of there?

1047
01:01:32,314 --> 01:01:33,599
I'm fine.

1048
01:01:33,773 --> 01:01:35,434
Everything's gonna be okay.

1049
01:01:35,609 --> 01:01:37,770
Don't worry about me.
Now get out of the car.

1050
01:01:37,944 --> 01:01:40,731
- No, Pop. No. I'm not leaving you!
- Get away from here!

1051
01:01:40,906 --> 01:01:44,615
Do it now!
Jonas, do what I tell you, son!

1052
01:02:01,676 --> 01:02:03,337
So I want this recorded

1053
01:02:03,511 --> 01:02:05,593
in case something happens to me.

1054
01:02:12,479 --> 01:02:14,310
Thank you, Karen.
Send him in.

1055
01:02:14,481 --> 01:02:16,563
Have a seat.

1056
01:02:18,485 --> 01:02:21,773
Daniel Maldonado's son
finally reaches out.

1057
01:02:23,531 --> 01:02:25,738
There's no such thing
as coincidence, right?

1058
01:02:25,909 --> 01:02:27,740
Your phone number was in the file

1059
01:02:27,911 --> 01:02:29,447
Lydia Vecchio gave me.

1060
01:02:29,621 --> 01:02:31,486
That's right.

1061
01:02:31,665 --> 01:02:33,656
All those pictures,

1062
01:02:33,833 --> 01:02:35,664
my father's confession--

1063
01:02:35,835 --> 01:02:38,372
none of that was enough
to put Sarcone away?

1064
01:02:40,799 --> 01:02:43,131
I want Sarcone more than anyone.

1065
01:02:43,301 --> 01:02:45,792
Sometimes in my business,
you do what you can...

1066
01:02:47,055 --> 01:02:48,795
- hope for the best.
- That's bullshit.

1067
01:02:48,974 --> 01:02:52,307
Something's telling me there's
a little more than hope involved here.

1068
01:02:52,477 --> 01:02:55,560
Your father was trying
to do the right thing.

1069
01:02:55,730 --> 01:02:58,312
So why are you here,
Officer Maldonado?

1070
01:02:59,317 --> 01:03:00,978
Tell me plainly.

1071
01:03:01,152 --> 01:03:04,235
I wanna serve Sarcone
to you on a platter.

1072
01:03:04,406 --> 01:03:06,317
Aha.

1073
01:03:06,491 --> 01:03:08,527
I just need to know how to do it.

1074
01:03:17,752 --> 01:03:20,835
- Who is it?
- It's Jonas.

1075
01:03:33,518 --> 01:03:35,179
Get to the point, Jonas.

1076
01:03:37,230 --> 01:03:39,061
What do you really want for us?

1077
01:03:39,232 --> 01:03:41,723
- What I want?
- Yeah.

1078
01:03:42,902 --> 01:03:44,813
Why are you here, Jonas?

1079
01:03:44,988 --> 01:03:46,194
Huh?

1080
01:03:46,364 --> 01:03:48,946
I mean, am I really what you want?

1081
01:03:52,787 --> 01:03:54,277
Come here.

1082
01:03:56,207 --> 01:03:57,492
Don't be like that.

1083
01:03:57,667 --> 01:03:59,282
I want you, Cyn.

1084
01:03:59,461 --> 01:04:01,201
It's always been you.

1085
01:04:04,049 --> 01:04:05,539
Tell me.

1086
01:04:07,302 --> 01:04:08,792
Tell me.

1087
01:04:09,846 --> 01:04:12,713
Jonas, you never tell me
that you love me.

1088
01:04:14,726 --> 01:04:16,682
I need to hear you say it.

1089
01:04:19,064 --> 01:04:20,429
Say it.

1090
01:04:28,615 --> 01:04:30,901
You're a piece of shit.

1091
01:04:31,076 --> 01:04:32,907
- Come here.
- Get out of my house.

1092
01:04:33,078 --> 01:04:35,569
- Come here.
- Don't you fucking touch me.

1093
01:04:36,623 --> 01:04:38,614
Get out of my house.

1094
01:04:39,918 --> 01:04:42,409
Get out of my house.

1095
01:05:16,162 --> 01:05:17,777
Yeah

1096
01:05:17,956 --> 01:05:20,447
You looking at me
then you see what you see

1097
01:05:20,625 --> 01:05:24,538
I'm like, hey, oh yeah

1098
01:05:24,712 --> 01:05:27,624
And in my city
I'll be running with bulls

1099
01:05:27,799 --> 01:05:30,085
I'm like, hey, oh yeah

1100
01:05:30,260 --> 01:05:34,048
You can watch it
from the sideline, oh

1101
01:05:34,222 --> 01:05:37,305
Sideline, oh, sideline

1102
01:05:37,475 --> 01:05:40,933
People watching from the sideline

1103
01:05:41,104 --> 01:05:43,766
Sideline, hey

1104
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:47,103
Hey, nigga, you know I'll be good...

1105
01:05:58,163 --> 01:06:00,028
Morning, baby.

1106
01:06:00,206 --> 01:06:02,492
You want some coffee?

1107
01:06:02,667 --> 01:06:04,498
Coffee?

1108
01:06:12,177 --> 01:06:13,883
What? What's up?

1109
01:06:14,053 --> 01:06:15,964
I just don't trust many people.

1110
01:06:16,139 --> 01:06:18,471
I got a lot going on right now.

1111
01:06:18,641 --> 01:06:20,973
a lotta things
I gotta get done, that's all.

1112
01:06:34,616 --> 01:06:36,447
A.D., what's up?
What you got for me?

1113
01:06:36,618 --> 01:06:38,108
I shook Sully down. I found out

1114
01:06:38,286 --> 01:06:41,323
that Baez launders money
at the Queens Raceway.

1115
01:06:41,498 --> 01:06:43,454
Yo, you ain't gonna believe this.

1116
01:06:43,625 --> 01:06:46,162
You know Cyn's brother Angie?
He's running the place.

1117
01:06:46,336 --> 01:06:48,827
Find Lucas and wait
for my call, all right?

1118
01:06:49,005 --> 01:06:52,042
- A'ight, I'm on it.
- A'ight.

1119
01:06:56,429 --> 01:06:58,135
- Hey.
- Lureu.

1120
01:06:58,306 --> 01:07:00,342
- What's going on?
- I got something.

1121
01:07:00,517 --> 01:07:01,848
Yeah, it's major.

1122
01:07:02,018 --> 01:07:03,599
No, Sarcone don't know nothing about it.

1123
01:07:03,770 --> 01:07:06,182
You trust me, don't you?

1124
01:07:06,356 --> 01:07:08,221
I'll pick you up in 10.

1125
01:07:27,418 --> 01:07:28,908
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

1126
01:07:32,549 --> 01:07:34,210
- Hey.
- How you doing?

1127
01:07:34,384 --> 01:07:36,921
I've been really lucky today
if you need any suggestions.

1128
01:07:37,095 --> 01:07:39,211
Well, I'm actually here
on official police business.

1129
01:07:39,389 --> 01:07:41,175
I'm gonna need you to buzz us
into that back door.

1130
01:07:41,349 --> 01:07:42,885
Let me call upstairs about that.

1131
01:07:43,059 --> 01:07:44,595
Look, if you make that phone call,

1132
01:07:44,769 --> 01:07:46,851
you might as well be an accomplice
to everything that goes on here.

1133
01:07:47,021 --> 01:07:49,603
Yo, they don't pay me enough for this.

1134
01:07:49,774 --> 01:07:51,059
Go around that counter

1135
01:07:51,234 --> 01:07:53,350
- and I'm gonna buzz you in.
- All right

1136
01:08:13,631 --> 01:08:15,792
Brother, stay the fuck down.

1137
01:08:15,967 --> 01:08:17,832
- Where you going? Where you going?
- Fuck.

1138
01:08:18,011 --> 01:08:19,547
Stay there or I'll kick you
in your fucking head.

1139
01:08:19,721 --> 01:08:21,427
Chill. Yeah yeah.

1140
01:08:21,598 --> 01:08:24,886
What are you doing with these guys?
Especially this asshole right here?

1141
01:08:25,059 --> 01:08:27,300
- Yo, keep fucking with me, old man.
- You wanna try me?

1142
01:08:27,478 --> 01:08:30,515
I can make you vanish.
Poof! You'll be gone.

1143
01:08:30,690 --> 01:08:32,180
Just say one more
fucking thing, all right?

1144
01:08:32,358 --> 01:08:33,689
Yo, my deal, my crew.
Fuck that.

1145
01:08:33,860 --> 01:08:35,976
This isn't good, kid.
This isn't good.

1146
01:08:36,154 --> 01:08:38,770
You wanna test Joe?
I can't save you.

1147
01:08:38,948 --> 01:08:40,904
- Get your ass up.
- A'ight, man.

1148
01:08:41,075 --> 01:08:43,532
- What the fuck, Malo?
- I knew it was just a matter of time

1149
01:08:43,703 --> 01:08:45,489
- before I see you again, Angie.
- Wait, you know this guy?

1150
01:08:45,663 --> 01:08:46,994
- Yeah, I know him.
- Why you didn't tell me you know

1151
01:08:47,165 --> 01:08:49,827
- this guy? What the hell's going on?
- My high school sweetheart--

1152
01:08:50,001 --> 01:08:52,117
this is her brother right here--
Angelo. Angie the Greek.

1153
01:08:52,295 --> 01:08:55,162
He's the one got us started in the game,
hustling a corner, slinging.

1154
01:08:55,340 --> 01:08:56,750
- Right, Angie?
- This is the thanks I get

1155
01:08:56,924 --> 01:08:58,835
- for starting you out?
- Found out his sister fell for me,

1156
01:08:59,010 --> 01:09:02,047
beat her within inches of her life.
Remember that, Angie?

1157
01:09:02,221 --> 01:09:04,928
- A real class act.
- Go to hell, Malo.

1158
01:09:05,099 --> 01:09:06,714
You think I forgot about that autograph

1159
01:09:06,893 --> 01:09:09,259
you signed on my forehead
with that baseball bat? Huh?

1160
01:09:14,484 --> 01:09:16,770
You know who
this place belongs to?

1161
01:09:17,945 --> 01:09:19,355
Gabriel Baez.

1162
01:09:19,530 --> 01:09:21,066
You ever hear of him?

1163
01:09:21,240 --> 01:09:22,821
This is Gabriel Baez's place?

1164
01:09:23,868 --> 01:09:25,733
You know who Gabriel Baez is?

1165
01:09:25,912 --> 01:09:28,278
We work with this guy, for God's sake.

1166
01:09:28,456 --> 01:09:29,912
A'ight, a'ight, look,

1167
01:09:30,083 --> 01:09:33,416
Iet's-- let's just get outta here.

1168
01:09:33,586 --> 01:09:34,951
- Don't touch a fucking thing.
- Easy easy.

1169
01:09:35,129 --> 01:09:37,415
- Whoa whoa whoa.
- You gonna let 'em put guns in my face?

1170
01:09:37,590 --> 01:09:38,796
You gonna put a gun
in my fucking face?

1171
01:09:38,966 --> 01:09:40,456
You better listen to him, Malo,

1172
01:09:40,635 --> 01:09:42,125
'cause when Baez finds you,
he's gonna watch me

1173
01:09:42,303 --> 01:09:44,635
fist you with this hand
right before he kills you.

1174
01:09:44,806 --> 01:09:46,637
Are you high?

1175
01:09:46,808 --> 01:09:48,548
Are you high?
You wanna make a move on Joe?

1176
01:09:48,726 --> 01:09:50,182
After Joe's finished with you,

1177
01:09:50,353 --> 01:09:51,718
there ain't gonna be nothing left
for Baez to hurt.

1178
01:09:51,896 --> 01:09:55,104
- Do you hear me, kid?
- You're a cop?

1179
01:09:56,901 --> 01:09:59,017
That's funny.

1180
01:09:59,195 --> 01:10:01,561
Come on, Malo. There's enough money
to go around for all of us, man.

1181
01:10:01,739 --> 01:10:03,525
- You ain't gotta do this.
- Shut the fuck up.

1182
01:10:03,700 --> 01:10:05,656
- You still mad? That was years ago.
- Now look at you.

1183
01:10:05,827 --> 01:10:08,364
- For Christ's sake, do something!
- Don't do it.

1184
01:10:08,538 --> 01:10:10,574
- Shoot that pig!
- We ain't here for that, man!

1185
01:10:10,748 --> 01:10:12,488
Do it!

1186
01:10:12,667 --> 01:10:15,409
- Shit!
- It's a big mistake, kid.

1187
01:10:15,586 --> 01:10:18,043
What the fuck is wrong with you?
What are you thinking about?

1188
01:10:20,508 --> 01:10:21,839
Yeah!

1189
01:10:22,009 --> 01:10:23,249
What the fuck, man?

1190
01:10:23,428 --> 01:10:25,339
Get some rope or something.
Tie him up.

1191
01:10:26,723 --> 01:10:28,964
- Take all that shit.
- Oh shit, man.

1192
01:10:39,569 --> 01:10:42,402
Adios, old friend.

1193
01:10:46,451 --> 01:10:48,863
I don't know, man.

1194
01:10:49,036 --> 01:10:51,118
- You sure about this, Malo?
- Of course I'm sure.

1195
01:10:51,289 --> 01:10:54,247
- You got something you wanna say?
- Yo, I don't give a fuck.

1196
01:10:54,417 --> 01:10:56,624
Come on, let's go.

1197
01:11:02,633 --> 01:11:04,999
We are exactly where
we're supposed to be, my friends.

1198
01:11:05,178 --> 01:11:07,009
The sky's the limit, right?

1199
01:11:07,180 --> 01:11:09,546
I don't think so anymore.

1200
01:11:09,724 --> 01:11:11,385
Hey, remember when we were kids

1201
01:11:11,559 --> 01:11:13,515
and we used to play cops
and robbers in the rain?

1202
01:11:13,686 --> 01:11:16,052
Yeah, you never wanted
to be the cop.

1203
01:11:16,230 --> 01:11:17,686
I do now.

1204
01:11:17,857 --> 01:11:19,893
For all the wrong reasons.

1205
01:11:20,067 --> 01:11:21,807
Yo, what the fuck is
that supposed to mean?

1206
01:11:24,197 --> 01:11:26,438
I don't wanna do this anymore.

1207
01:11:26,616 --> 01:11:29,198
What, you ain't down for us no more?

1208
01:11:29,368 --> 01:11:31,780
No, I'm not down for this shit anymore.

1209
01:11:31,954 --> 01:11:33,239
- Oh yeah? Yeah?
- Yeah, you heard me.

1210
01:11:33,414 --> 01:11:34,824
- You got a problem with that?
- Shut up, man.

1211
01:11:34,999 --> 01:11:36,580
Both of you just shut
the hell up, all right?

1212
01:11:36,751 --> 01:11:38,742
Chill the hell out, man.

1213
01:11:38,920 --> 01:11:41,252
Look, if you want out,
A.D., you can go.

1214
01:11:41,422 --> 01:11:43,504
It ain't gonna change nothing.

1215
01:11:43,674 --> 01:11:45,414
Badges ain't change us.
We're still us.

1216
01:11:45,593 --> 01:11:48,084
You know, badge or no badge,
this is bullshit.

1217
01:11:49,847 --> 01:11:51,678
Just as bad as Sarcone is, Malo.

1218
01:11:51,849 --> 01:11:54,932
And the crazy thing is you like it.

1219
01:11:55,102 --> 01:11:58,594
And this asshole over here wants
to grow up to be just like you

1220
01:11:58,773 --> 01:12:00,513
if you don't get us all killed first.

1221
01:12:00,691 --> 01:12:02,647
That's how you feel?

1222
01:12:04,111 --> 01:12:05,817
I'm done, man.

1223
01:12:07,281 --> 01:12:09,863
- I'm out.
- Was it really that bad?

1224
01:12:12,703 --> 01:12:14,694
You think I'd leave if it wasn't?

1225
01:12:26,342 --> 01:12:28,003
Don't listen to that pussy.

1226
01:12:28,177 --> 01:12:31,089
You got it all under control
like you always do. Right, my dude?

1227
01:12:31,264 --> 01:12:33,095
Shut up, Lucas.

1228
01:12:39,272 --> 01:12:41,934
You've been telling me what to do
since we was little kids.

1229
01:12:43,442 --> 01:12:44,978
I'm tired of it.

1230
01:12:46,612 --> 01:12:49,479
What do you think she'd do
if she knows you killed Angie?

1231
01:12:49,657 --> 01:12:52,649
You think Cyn would forgive you
for killing her brother?

1232
01:12:52,827 --> 01:12:54,442
And what about Sarcone?

1233
01:12:54,620 --> 01:12:57,862
What do you think he'd do he knows
you're stabbing him in the back?

1234
01:12:59,542 --> 01:13:02,033
Don't you play all high
and mighty with me, bitch.

1235
01:13:03,337 --> 01:13:05,419
'Cause you can't fuck with me,

1236
01:13:05,590 --> 01:13:08,627
but I can fuck with you though.

1237
01:13:08,801 --> 01:13:10,541
You remember that.

1238
01:13:24,609 --> 01:13:26,645
Gabriel.

1239
01:13:26,819 --> 01:13:28,730
How does this happen?
Completely unacceptable.

1240
01:13:28,905 --> 01:13:30,566
Yeah yeah, I know,
I know, I know.

1241
01:13:30,740 --> 01:13:33,106
- You need to fix this now.
- Yeah, don't worry. I got it.

1242
01:13:33,284 --> 01:13:34,899
How could the racetrack get hit?

1243
01:13:35,077 --> 01:13:36,613
- What am I paying you for?
- Yeah, I got it.

1244
01:13:36,787 --> 01:13:38,493
- You need to make this right.
- I got it.

1245
01:13:38,664 --> 01:13:41,622
- You have two days to find my money.
- Okay okay.

1246
01:13:47,298 --> 01:13:49,835
It's Lureu.
At the beep, say it.

1247
01:14:03,147 --> 01:14:06,639
- I'm out.
- Oh yeah.

1248
01:14:10,237 --> 01:14:12,694
- Hey.
- Where the fuck are you?

1249
01:14:12,865 --> 01:14:15,026
Something very messy just went down.

1250
01:14:15,201 --> 01:14:16,486
You sound worried, Joe.

1251
01:14:16,661 --> 01:14:20,074
- Have you seen your partner lately?
- No, why?

1252
01:14:20,247 --> 01:14:22,033
I'm in a spot
where I can get touched real bad.

1253
01:14:22,208 --> 01:14:24,164
An associate just got jacked
for nine digits

1254
01:14:24,335 --> 01:14:26,576
and that just don't happen
without me knowing about it.

1255
01:14:26,754 --> 01:14:28,494
I don't know what the fuck is going on.

1256
01:14:28,673 --> 01:14:30,413
Lureu's not picking up his phone

1257
01:14:30,591 --> 01:14:32,752
and I can't find him
and I don't know what to think now.

1258
01:14:32,927 --> 01:14:35,088
Sounds like you know
who the rat is, Joe.

1259
01:14:35,262 --> 01:14:37,719
- How much did he steal?
- I can't cover it.

1260
01:14:40,476 --> 01:14:43,218
- And I didn't say it was Lureu.
- But you think it is.

1261
01:14:43,396 --> 01:14:45,682
- Want me go find him?
- Nah.

1262
01:14:45,856 --> 01:14:48,893
If he don't wanna be found, he's got a
million places to lay up and stay high.

1263
01:14:49,068 --> 01:14:51,855
- That's what I'm worried about.
- Want me hit the streets,

1264
01:14:52,029 --> 01:14:54,896
- make some things happen?
- No, what I want you to do

1265
01:14:55,074 --> 01:14:56,814
is I want you to meet
my friend Gabriel Baez,

1266
01:14:56,993 --> 01:14:58,483
and I want you to calm him down.

1267
01:14:58,661 --> 01:15:00,117
Okay, whatever you want, Joe.

1268
01:15:02,081 --> 01:15:03,617
Fuck Lureu.
I got you, right?

1269
01:15:03,791 --> 01:15:06,874
That's right.
You can always trust me.

1270
01:15:07,878 --> 01:15:09,493
Okay.

1271
01:15:28,566 --> 01:15:31,808
My name's Jonas Maldonado, Malo.

1272
01:15:31,986 --> 01:15:34,352
Are you wearing a wire,
Mr. Maldonado?

1273
01:15:34,530 --> 01:15:38,068
- No sir.
- Joe speaks very highly of you.

1274
01:15:38,242 --> 01:15:40,278
Thank you, sir.

1275
01:15:40,453 --> 01:15:43,911
It is disrespectful of him
to send a messenger in his place.

1276
01:15:44,915 --> 01:15:46,997
Don't you agree, Mr. Maldonado?

1277
01:15:48,753 --> 01:15:50,289
Speak, messenger.

1278
01:15:50,463 --> 01:15:53,250
You think Joe sent me here
to pacify you,

1279
01:15:53,424 --> 01:15:55,085
but he sent me here to lie to you.

1280
01:15:56,093 --> 01:15:58,004
Where is Joe, Mr. Maldonado?

1281
01:15:58,179 --> 01:16:00,170
Somewhere counting your money.

1282
01:16:04,310 --> 01:16:08,519
Please do choose
your next words very carefully.

1283
01:16:08,689 --> 01:16:10,270
Explain.

1284
01:16:10,441 --> 01:16:12,147
None of what
went down was my idea.

1285
01:16:12,318 --> 01:16:14,525
Are you about to admit
to stealing from me?

1286
01:16:14,695 --> 01:16:16,026
I was there, yes,

1287
01:16:16,197 --> 01:16:18,028
but it's Sarcone that's screwing you.

1288
01:16:18,199 --> 01:16:19,484
He's trying to use me to do it

1289
01:16:19,658 --> 01:16:21,740
and I don't wanna be in the middle
when you screw him back.

1290
01:16:21,911 --> 01:16:23,401
But you're still in the bed,

1291
01:16:23,579 --> 01:16:26,571
aren't you, Mr. Maldonado?

1292
01:16:26,749 --> 01:16:28,660
Now where is my property?

1293
01:16:28,834 --> 01:16:31,450
Sarcone has it, but I can get it back.

1294
01:16:31,629 --> 01:16:34,996
- All of it.
- Why do you betray your patrn?

1295
01:16:37,510 --> 01:16:40,627
These are the transcripts
from the DEA's wiretaps

1296
01:16:40,805 --> 01:16:42,466
inside Sarcone's bar.

1297
01:16:43,516 --> 01:16:45,131
He's over a barrel.

1298
01:16:45,309 --> 01:16:47,846
He'll give everyone up
to save his own ass.

1299
01:16:49,313 --> 01:16:50,803
All they really want is you.

1300
01:16:50,981 --> 01:16:52,687
Robbing you is just his way

1301
01:16:52,858 --> 01:16:55,440
of fucking you a little deeper
before he hands you over.

1302
01:16:57,071 --> 01:16:58,402
So are we in business?

1303
01:16:58,572 --> 01:17:00,813
What do you want, Mr. Maldonado?

1304
01:17:00,991 --> 01:17:02,731
I want Sarcone's seat at your table.

1305
01:17:04,328 --> 01:17:05,613
First my property.

1306
01:17:09,416 --> 01:17:12,249
Half the money
and the product is with Lureu.

1307
01:17:12,419 --> 01:17:14,080
Here's an address, key to a car--

1308
01:17:14,255 --> 01:17:15,620
half your stuff is in it.

1309
01:17:15,798 --> 01:17:17,459
Sarcone has the other half.

1310
01:17:17,633 --> 01:17:20,841
I'll bring him out in the open so
you can deal with him how you see fit.

1311
01:17:21,846 --> 01:17:24,462
I'm really resourceful, Mr. Baez.

1312
01:17:25,516 --> 01:17:27,507
You're dismissed.

1313
01:17:40,406 --> 01:17:41,942
Stay close, man.

1314
01:17:48,205 --> 01:17:49,991
- Motherfuckers!
- You stay down!

1315
01:17:54,044 --> 01:17:55,580
You drive.

1316
01:18:07,433 --> 01:18:09,014
- Joe.
- Did you find him?

1317
01:18:09,185 --> 01:18:11,847
No, I ain't find him,
but I found half the money at his place.

1318
01:18:12,021 --> 01:18:14,728
- It look like he did it.
- Ahh.

1319
01:18:14,899 --> 01:18:17,060
- Baez is gonna be pissed.
- I know, I know,

1320
01:18:17,234 --> 01:18:19,771
but relax, man.
Baez don't know who jacked him.

1321
01:18:19,945 --> 01:18:21,981
He should be happy
you found half his stuff.

1322
01:18:22,156 --> 01:18:23,987
Maybe ask for a finder's fee.

1323
01:18:24,158 --> 01:18:26,865
- Remember who's doing who a favor.
- A'ight.

1324
01:18:33,709 --> 01:18:35,995
- Hello, this is Jude.
- Hello.

1325
01:18:36,170 --> 01:18:38,912
Agent Jude, I think all the pieces
are falling in place.

1326
01:18:39,089 --> 01:18:40,829
I just need a few more things.

1327
01:18:41,008 --> 01:18:44,375
You know, I understand you wanting
to avenge your father's death and all,

1328
01:18:44,553 --> 01:18:47,260
but what happens after that, huh?

1329
01:18:49,266 --> 01:18:52,099
I mean, you ever actually thought
about respecting the badge?

1330
01:18:52,269 --> 01:18:55,761
Perhaps aiming some
of that angst in the right direction?

1331
01:18:55,940 --> 01:18:58,556
No, I ain't thought about that lately.

1332
01:19:01,654 --> 01:19:03,190
So what do you need?

1333
01:19:38,315 --> 01:19:40,647
Kill me?
You wanna kill me?

1334
01:19:40,818 --> 01:19:43,059
You ain't got the balls to face me

1335
01:19:43,237 --> 01:19:45,853
man to man! Huh?

1336
01:19:49,952 --> 01:19:51,692
Oh, so you're gonna take me out?

1337
01:19:52,746 --> 01:19:54,236
It's like that?

1338
01:19:54,415 --> 01:19:56,656
Well, come on then! Come on!

1339
01:19:58,711 --> 01:20:00,702
Piece of shit.

1340
01:21:00,564 --> 01:21:03,852
- Is that the rest of my property?
- It's right there, sir.

1341
01:21:07,154 --> 01:21:09,520
Like you predicted, Joe did call--

1342
01:21:10,657 --> 01:21:12,488
add insult to injury.

1343
01:21:14,244 --> 01:21:16,451
You're clever, Mr. Maldonado.

1344
01:21:17,915 --> 01:21:19,576
You satisfied?

1345
01:21:21,210 --> 01:21:24,418
Remind me-- what is my incentive

1346
01:21:24,588 --> 01:21:27,125
for not shooting you
or killing you right now?

1347
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:33,676
I'm clever.
You just said it.

1348
01:21:37,267 --> 01:21:40,885
Joe underestimated you.
I will not.

1349
01:21:41,063 --> 01:21:43,395
I've proven my loyalty to you.

1350
01:21:43,565 --> 01:21:45,146
Not yet,

1351
01:21:45,317 --> 01:21:47,273
but soon you will.

1352
01:21:48,946 --> 01:21:51,688
Oh shit.
What the fuck is going on here?

1353
01:21:51,865 --> 01:21:54,857
Hup! Take it easy.

1354
01:21:56,078 --> 01:21:57,943
What is this?

1355
01:21:58,122 --> 01:22:00,408
It's a test.

1356
01:22:07,965 --> 01:22:11,583
- Who's the girl?
- I know that your friend is a liability

1357
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:15,844
that Joe tolerates just
to keep you close to him.

1358
01:22:16,014 --> 01:22:17,845
I really don't know why.

1359
01:22:18,016 --> 01:22:20,132
I don't deal with liabilities.

1360
01:22:21,228 --> 01:22:22,968
Unfortunately,

1361
01:22:23,147 --> 01:22:26,389
the girl was with your friend
when we picked him up.

1362
01:22:27,568 --> 01:22:30,776
She's an innocent bystander.

1363
01:22:34,575 --> 01:22:37,567
Now you're dealing with me,
Mr. Maldonado.

1364
01:22:38,620 --> 01:22:41,407
You're gonna shoot one of them

1365
01:22:42,499 --> 01:22:44,205
or I'll kill them both.

1366
01:22:46,587 --> 01:22:48,999
You choose, Mr. Maldonado.

1367
01:23:34,218 --> 01:23:36,334
- Hey.
- All right, let's start it. Let's go.

1368
01:23:36,512 --> 01:23:38,719
- Everybody in line.
- Nice.

1369
01:23:38,889 --> 01:23:40,720
Here we go.

1370
01:23:41,767 --> 01:23:44,304
Come on, you little sissies.
Let's go. Move it!

1371
01:24:01,245 --> 01:24:02,860
What-- what's up, man?

1372
01:24:03,038 --> 01:24:05,404
Guys, come on!
Let's move move!

1373
01:24:05,582 --> 01:24:07,789
It's good what you're doing, man.

1374
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:10,121
Hut hut! Hey hey, hold on.

1375
01:24:10,295 --> 01:24:12,206
You know, my TO was right.

1376
01:24:13,382 --> 01:24:15,168
I've learned a lot about myself.

1377
01:24:17,427 --> 01:24:19,509
You could too.

1378
01:24:19,680 --> 01:24:22,922
32, grip the ball. Set. Hut hut!

1379
01:24:23,100 --> 01:24:25,386
There you go. There you go.

1380
01:24:25,561 --> 01:24:28,928
I gotta go back to the kids, man.

1381
01:24:29,106 --> 01:24:30,812
You be good.

1382
01:25:02,889 --> 01:25:04,629
You look like shit.

1383
01:25:07,686 --> 01:25:09,301
Sarcone is in the car.

1384
01:25:09,479 --> 01:25:11,344
Look sharp. This is it, folks.

1385
01:25:11,523 --> 01:25:13,605
Still no word from Lureu?

1386
01:25:21,450 --> 01:25:24,692
Yeah.
You know why I trust you, kid?

1387
01:25:24,870 --> 01:25:27,907
- 'Cause you know I won't fuck you over?
- Yeah.

1388
01:25:28,081 --> 01:25:29,821
When's the last time you seen Baez?

1389
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:31,706
Not long enough.

1390
01:25:31,877 --> 01:25:33,617
I gotta see that prick tonight.

1391
01:25:33,795 --> 01:25:36,662
As long as that money
come through nice

1392
01:25:36,840 --> 01:25:39,547
- twice a month, right?
- It takes a certain type of individual

1393
01:25:39,718 --> 01:25:42,255
to do what we do, to have the balls
to be the type of men we are.

1394
01:25:42,429 --> 01:25:44,215
You gotta want it-- all of it.

1395
01:25:44,389 --> 01:25:46,380
Good guys, bad guys--
that's all bullshit

1396
01:25:46,558 --> 01:25:50,221
when it comes down to it.
It's about money, fear and respect.

1397
01:25:50,395 --> 01:25:52,602
Like you, I always wanted all three.

1398
01:25:52,773 --> 01:25:56,186
Iike your father did when--
when we started out.

1399
01:25:59,613 --> 01:26:01,899
Do not let them out of your sight.

1400
01:26:23,679 --> 01:26:25,044
Copy that.

1401
01:26:27,557 --> 01:26:29,673
Tell me the story
about that plane heist.

1402
01:26:29,851 --> 01:26:32,718
- I love that story.
- What, how me and your dad started?

1403
01:26:32,896 --> 01:26:35,137
- Attaboy.
- Me and your father used to pick up

1404
01:26:35,315 --> 01:26:38,807
Baez's mules at JFK cargo
and escort 'em through the city.

1405
01:26:39,820 --> 01:26:42,061
We'd babysit through
distribution, collection

1406
01:26:42,239 --> 01:26:44,571
around the city,
then we'd escort 'em back to JFK.

1407
01:26:44,741 --> 01:26:46,356
Easy-peasy, 1 0 Gs easy.

1408
01:26:46,535 --> 01:26:49,777
- Nice.
- Yeah, 1 0 Gs

1409
01:26:49,955 --> 01:26:52,116
before skimming off the top of cargo.

1410
01:26:52,290 --> 01:26:55,327
That's how I built my empire,
stealing dope from that--

1411
01:26:56,420 --> 01:26:57,830
you know, dope.

1412
01:26:59,089 --> 01:27:01,922
- So when did it go bad?
- Between me and Baez?

1413
01:27:02,092 --> 01:27:03,628
No, between you and my father.

1414
01:27:14,479 --> 01:27:16,595
I told you everything
you need to know, kid.

1415
01:27:17,607 --> 01:27:19,063
Tell me what you think I don't know.

1416
01:27:23,780 --> 01:27:25,441
You know...

1417
01:27:26,491 --> 01:27:28,231
when it came down to it,

1418
01:27:28,410 --> 01:27:31,152
your father was afraid
to make the tough decisions,

1419
01:27:31,329 --> 01:27:33,160
so he made the wrong ones.

1420
01:27:33,331 --> 01:27:35,447
Shake the tree, Malo.
Come on.

1421
01:27:35,625 --> 01:27:37,206
I've always done right by you, kid.

1422
01:27:37,377 --> 01:27:39,868
- Like a father to me.
- Like a father.

1423
01:27:42,090 --> 01:27:44,297
And I wouldn't offer you my hand

1424
01:27:44,468 --> 01:27:46,083
if I thought you were gonna bite it.

1425
01:27:48,054 --> 01:27:49,965
I just wanna know the truth.

1426
01:27:50,140 --> 01:27:52,096
Attaboy.

1427
01:27:55,270 --> 01:27:56,976
I never ever,

1428
01:27:57,147 --> 01:28:00,059
not for one instant, thought your father
would or could rat us out,

1429
01:28:00,233 --> 01:28:03,145
but the facts are what they are.
He made a deal with an ADA.

1430
01:28:04,613 --> 01:28:07,480
We're talking serious jail time
for everybody, including me.

1431
01:28:07,657 --> 01:28:10,023
Everybody was gonna be shamed
and disgraced in the papers,

1432
01:28:10,202 --> 01:28:11,282
the whole nine yards.

1433
01:28:11,453 --> 01:28:14,445
And the word came down
on Monday morning. It had to get done.

1434
01:28:15,874 --> 01:28:17,284
Why you?

1435
01:28:18,502 --> 01:28:20,959
Because l-- I was his partner.

1436
01:28:21,129 --> 01:28:22,994
It was a test of my loyalty.

1437
01:28:23,173 --> 01:28:24,754
Was it them or was it him?

1438
01:28:24,925 --> 01:28:26,756
What would you do?

1439
01:28:28,970 --> 01:28:30,801
It was a Wednesday.

1440
01:28:31,890 --> 01:28:33,926
We followed him
to Roosevelt lsland and--

1441
01:28:34,100 --> 01:28:35,840
All units, stand ready.

1442
01:28:36,019 --> 01:28:40,262
And he was pulled over
by a patrol car, of all things.

1443
01:28:40,440 --> 01:28:43,102
We waited for them to leave
and then we went over.

1444
01:28:44,277 --> 01:28:45,983
I made him get out. I...

1445
01:28:55,330 --> 01:28:57,161
Your father was a--

1446
01:29:00,001 --> 01:29:01,957
your father was a...

1447
01:29:03,004 --> 01:29:04,335
he was a rat.

1448
01:29:05,841 --> 01:29:07,797
Take him
when he exits the car.

1449
01:29:17,477 --> 01:29:19,092
Would you do it again?

1450
01:29:20,272 --> 01:29:23,514
Your father was afraid
to make the tough decisions.

1451
01:29:23,692 --> 01:29:27,935
Men like us are built to make
those kinds of decisions.

1452
01:29:28,113 --> 01:29:30,354
That's who we are.
Can you do that?

1453
01:29:30,532 --> 01:29:32,739
Can you make those tough decisions?

1454
01:29:36,413 --> 01:29:37,778
I already have.

1455
01:29:47,090 --> 01:29:48,421
Take him. Go. Go go!

1456
01:29:49,551 --> 01:29:53,009
I'm gonna go.
Get your fucking hands off me.

1457
01:30:00,687 --> 01:30:02,928
Man down.
Where'd that shot come from?

1458
01:30:04,107 --> 01:30:06,314
Check the rooftops now!

1459
01:30:07,319 --> 01:30:08,934
Where'd that shot come from?

1460
01:30:09,112 --> 01:30:11,444
It's gotta be Baez! God damn it!

1461
01:30:11,615 --> 01:30:13,276
Everybody out there right now!

1462
01:30:13,450 --> 01:30:16,032
Get up on those rooftops, all units!

1463
01:30:16,202 --> 01:30:18,238
Shut down everything!
I don't want anybody

1464
01:30:18,413 --> 01:30:20,779
getting out of this area,
not in a five-block radius!

1465
01:30:20,957 --> 01:30:23,289
- I want everybody to move now!
- Fall back. I'm going in.

1466
01:30:23,460 --> 01:30:25,075
What the hell happened?

1467
01:30:26,922 --> 01:30:29,629
I need a car on that end.
I need a car on this end.

1468
01:30:43,313 --> 01:30:45,599
Thanks for not
giving up on me, Cyn.

1469
01:30:55,825 --> 01:30:58,908
- You always get what you want?
- I did my part.

1470
01:30:59,079 --> 01:31:01,786
Oh, I know what you did
and I know what you're planning.

1471
01:31:02,874 --> 01:31:04,284
With my help, you got Baez

1472
01:31:04,459 --> 01:31:06,165
to clear Sarcone out of the picture

1473
01:31:06,336 --> 01:31:08,998
and now you get to take
Sarcone's place at Baez's table.

1474
01:31:09,172 --> 01:31:10,787
That's very clever.

1475
01:31:10,966 --> 01:31:12,581
Why don't you try

1476
01:31:12,759 --> 01:31:15,375
working for the good guys for a change?

1477
01:31:15,553 --> 01:31:17,384
I know you got it in you.

1478
01:31:18,848 --> 01:31:20,554
You think you know me.

1479
01:31:20,725 --> 01:31:23,091
I'm not a good guy.

1480
01:31:25,855 --> 01:31:28,141
All right, part-time then.

1481
01:31:28,316 --> 01:31:30,272
Part-time good guy, like a--

1482
01:31:31,736 --> 01:31:33,192
a freelancer.

1483
01:31:33,363 --> 01:31:34,728
Freelancer, huh?

1484
01:31:37,075 --> 01:31:39,407
If you're gonna wear the badge,

1485
01:31:39,577 --> 01:31:41,943
take the responsibility
that goes with it, huh?

1486
01:31:44,332 --> 01:31:47,324
Who knows? You might even find
a little self-respect too.

1487
01:31:50,046 --> 01:31:52,253
Agent Jude,
this is an old friend of mine.

1488
01:31:52,424 --> 01:31:54,710
- Hello.
- Hi.

1489
01:31:54,884 --> 01:31:56,590
Agent Jude works for the DEA.

1490
01:31:57,804 --> 01:31:58,964
He's my new boss.

1491
01:32:00,932 --> 01:32:03,139
- Nice to have met you.
- Likewise.

1492
01:32:07,897 --> 01:32:09,387
I'll be going undercover.

1493
01:32:10,525 --> 01:32:12,436
What does that mean for us?

1494
01:32:12,610 --> 01:32:14,225
Look...

1495
01:32:15,780 --> 01:32:17,316
this is our time, Cyn.

1496
01:32:18,616 --> 01:32:20,106
Trust me.

1497
01:32:24,956 --> 01:32:26,446
Jonas.

1498
01:32:31,254 --> 01:32:32,915
I love you, Cyn.

1499
01:32:48,938 --> 01:32:51,771
Yeah!

1500
01:32:53,610 --> 01:32:54,645
Yeah!

1501
01:32:59,157 --> 01:33:01,398
- Decoy.
- Unh, shotgun flow

1502
01:33:01,576 --> 01:33:03,737
Hit 'em with the sawed-off,
killing all these haters

1503
01:33:03,912 --> 01:33:05,652
Make 'em all get hauled off

1504
01:33:05,830 --> 01:33:08,492
Bitch, look at me,
act like you don't see a king

1505
01:33:08,666 --> 01:33:11,248
Make you kneel down and kiss
the motherfucking ring

1506
01:33:11,419 --> 01:33:13,910
I ain't gonna hide,
you ain't gotta look for me

1507
01:33:14,089 --> 01:33:16,705
Taking back every single thing
that was took from me

1508
01:33:16,883 --> 01:33:19,215
So fly, burn into the sky

1509
01:33:19,385 --> 01:33:21,216
Screaming "Fuck the whole flow scene"

1510
01:33:21,387 --> 01:33:22,502
E, tell 'em why

1511
01:33:22,680 --> 01:33:25,342
I got the money and the power

1512
01:33:25,517 --> 01:33:28,224
I'm ready for the rain,
it's a shower

1513
01:33:28,394 --> 01:33:31,056
I'm running this city

1514
01:33:31,231 --> 01:33:33,813
I'm running this town, yeah

1515
01:33:33,983 --> 01:33:36,645
I'm Mr. Bad Guy, but it's all good

1516
01:33:36,820 --> 01:33:40,278
Yes, you tough,
but it's all good

1517
01:33:40,448 --> 01:33:45,158
This city,
I'm running this town, hey

1518
01:33:45,328 --> 01:33:47,319
Whoa, now I'm on top

1519
01:33:47,497 --> 01:33:50,284
I'm on--
whoa, now I'm on top

1520
01:33:50,458 --> 01:33:53,495
Whoa whoa, whoa whoa

1521
01:33:53,670 --> 01:33:57,128
Whoa, now I'm on top,
I'm on

1522
01:33:57,298 --> 01:34:01,086
Baby, I'm a bass,
ain't nobody fucking with me

1523
01:34:01,261 --> 01:34:04,503
- Come on
- Why can't you see

1524
01:34:04,681 --> 01:34:06,512
It's you and the world
against me?

1525
01:34:06,683 --> 01:34:08,674
Baby, I'm a rapper

1526
01:34:08,852 --> 01:34:12,219
I don't even care, so don't tell me
what you think and feel

1527
01:34:12,397 --> 01:34:15,560
- Hold on
- Remember, I won't stop

1528
01:34:15,733 --> 01:34:18,190
Surprised when
you see me on top

1529
01:34:18,361 --> 01:34:21,524
I got the money and the power

1530
01:34:21,698 --> 01:34:24,531
I'm ready for the rain,
it's a shower

1531
01:34:24,701 --> 01:34:27,158
I'm running this city

1532
01:34:27,328 --> 01:34:30,035
I'm running this town, yeah

1533
01:34:30,206 --> 01:34:32,822
I'm Mr. Bad Guy, but it's all good

1534
01:34:33,001 --> 01:34:36,493
Yes, you tough,
but it's all good

1535
01:34:36,671 --> 01:34:41,210
This city,
I'm running this town, hey

1536
01:34:41,384 --> 01:34:46,469
- Ho ho, ho ho
- Yeah, yeah

1537
01:34:46,639 --> 01:34:49,381
- Ho ho
- Yeah

1538
01:34:49,559 --> 01:34:54,849
- Ho ho, ho ho
- Yeah, yeah

1539
01:34:55,023 --> 01:34:57,730
- Ho ho
- Yeah

1540
01:34:57,901 --> 01:35:03,737
- Ho ho, ho ho
- Yeah, yeah

1541
01:35:05,408 --> 01:35:06,898
Yeah

1542
01:35:08,077 --> 01:35:09,567
Yeah

1543
01:35:11,080 --> 01:35:12,570
Yeah

1544
01:35:13,875 --> 01:35:14,864
Yeah

1545
01:35:15,043 --> 01:35:17,284
Ho ho

1546
01:35:17,462 --> 01:35:22,456
Ho ho, ho ho

1547
01:35:22,634 --> 01:35:25,216
Ho ho

1548
01:35:25,386 --> 01:35:29,095
- Ho ho
- Whoa, now I'm on top, I'm on

1549
01:35:29,265 --> 01:35:32,007
Whoa, now I'm on top, I'm on

1550
01:35:32,185 --> 01:35:34,767
Whoa whoa

1551
01:35:34,938 --> 01:35:37,429
Whoa, now I'm on top,
I'm on

1552
