1
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:43,794
"Upstate New York - November 27"

2
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:52,553
Where would we put
all that luggage?

3
00:00:52,636 --> 00:00:54,263
Think about that.

4
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:57,432
- You're very strong.
- Okay, push!

5
00:00:57,516 --> 00:01:00,853
This is the last holiday
I'm ever going on with you.

6
00:01:00,936 --> 00:01:03,355
Where'd you get all those muscles?

7
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:05,524
- Come on.
- More, more, more!

8
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:08,193
- Don't quit now.
- How much further?

9
00:01:08,277 --> 00:01:11,446
It's only a couple million more miles.

10
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:12,906
A couple of what?

11
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:16,535
Couple million more miles.
Right up here we're gonna stop.

12
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:18,370
Keep pushing. Don't quit.

13
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:22,082
- Mexico next time.
- Hawaii's better.

14
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:27,462
Hold it, hold it.
That's good.

15
00:01:35,554 --> 00:01:38,473
- Now what you gonna do?
- I'm gonna try to get us some-

16
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:40,142
- Help?
- Help.

17
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:47,566
Come on.
Let's have a snowball fight.

18
00:01:52,154 --> 00:01:53,488
Daddy! Daddy!

19
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,532
Come on!
Help me, Daddy!

20
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:11,673
Yes, do you have the number
for Emergency Road Service?

21
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,661
Thank you, Stan.

22
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:49,206
If you want a hand with anything,
just give me a shout, Mr. Russell.

23
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,874
I will, thanks.

24
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,171
Mr. Russell?

25
00:05:48,724 --> 00:05:51,059
Catch.

26
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:12,414
You know that this piece
is going to Seattle too, Estancia?

27
00:06:12,456 --> 00:06:14,082
Yes, sir.

28
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:16,919
Good.

29
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:33,101
At first, right after it happened,
I was in shock.

30
00:06:33,143 --> 00:06:37,064
I just functioned automatically.
I didn't feel anything.

31
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,359
And one day, it hit me-

32
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:44,738
Joanna and Kathy are gone.

33
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:48,450
I just kept walking around the apartment
saying it over and over: "They're gone."

34
00:06:48,492 --> 00:06:50,786
I guess I was about half crazy.

35
00:06:50,869 --> 00:06:53,497
But that's over four months ago...

36
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:56,124
and what I've got to do now is
start making demands of myself.

37
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:58,168
Your first class is next Monday.

38
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:00,963
I'll set up a meeting tomorrow
with some of the faculty.

39
00:07:01,046 --> 00:07:04,299
You'll remember a lot of them.
11:00 okay for you?

40
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:06,301
That's fine, Robert.
Thanks for everything you've done.

41
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:10,305
Come on. Everyone's very excited
about you being here.

42
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:13,809
A well-known alumnus and
distinguished composer like yourself.

43
00:07:14,852 --> 00:07:16,562
Says who?

44
00:07:16,645 --> 00:07:19,147
Distinguished or not,
we're glad you came.

45
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:21,692
Come on!
Give it to me!

46
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:24,236
- No!
- Okay, kids, keep it down.

47
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,489
Go into the kitchen,
get yourself some cookies.

48
00:07:29,533 --> 00:07:32,160
By the way, how long are you
planning to stay in that hotel?

49
00:07:32,244 --> 00:07:34,872
- There's plenty of room here.
- No, thanks, Eva.

50
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:39,001
I think I'm gonna find a house to rent.
I've got some things coming out.

51
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:42,504
I need a place I can lock myself in
and pound away at the piano all night.

52
00:07:42,588 --> 00:07:46,925
I have a friend who works for
the Historical Preservation Society.

53
00:07:47,009 --> 00:07:49,344
They have some old houses
that I'm sure they rent.

54
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:52,514
- We'll see what we can come up with.
- Good.

55
00:08:13,035 --> 00:08:15,162
- Mr. Russell?
- Yes.

56
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:19,124
Hello, I'm Claire Norman.
Why don't you hop in and we'll drive up.

57
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:20,626
Fine.

58
00:08:59,414 --> 00:09:02,376
- When was the house last occupied?
- Let's see.

59
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:05,879
About 12 years ago.
It's been with the Historical Society...

60
00:09:05,963 --> 00:09:07,923
for the past 12 years.

61
00:09:11,093 --> 00:09:12,678
There we go.

62
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:22,938
Wow.

63
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:26,900
There were plans at one time to
turn it into some kind of a museum.

64
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:32,030
But I don't know. I guess
a house was meant to be lived in.

65
00:09:32,865 --> 00:09:35,075
Why hasn't it been lived in?

66
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:38,036
I've only been with the Society
for a year now.

67
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:42,374
The impression I get is they haven't
tried very hard with this place.

68
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:44,376
Of course,
it does need a lot of work.

69
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:46,336
Yeah.

70
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:50,841
There's some pieces here
that are just stored.

71
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:54,219
You'd have your pick of them.
You know, whatever you'd like.

72
00:09:57,222 --> 00:09:58,682
Kitchen's in here.

73
00:09:58,724 --> 00:10:01,185
What does it take to maintain
a house of this size?

74
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:04,479
We have a man
who looks after all these places.

75
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:06,148
Mr. Tuttle.

76
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,484
And...

77
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:14,156
this is the music room.

78
00:10:14,198 --> 00:10:17,284
This is really why
I thought of you and this house.

79
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:21,163
The piano was left here
when the Society took over.

80
00:10:21,205 --> 00:10:23,790
Just too much trouble
to move, really.

81
00:10:23,874 --> 00:10:25,918
It must be in very bad shape.

82
00:10:29,755 --> 00:10:31,715
What are the terms?

83
00:11:37,948 --> 00:11:39,867
Sorry to disturb your composing.

84
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:43,161
That's all right, Mr. Tuttle.
This has already been composed.

85
00:11:43,245 --> 00:11:47,124
There's a man in front wanting
to deliver a water storage tank.

86
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:48,750
Oh, okay.

87
00:12:11,148 --> 00:12:13,358
Have you managed
to do any writing?

88
00:12:13,442 --> 00:12:16,653
I'm still working on the second
movement. Same old problem.

89
00:12:16,737 --> 00:12:20,199
Well, maybe the lectures will help,
get some new ideas going.

90
00:12:39,843 --> 00:12:41,428
It's my understanding...

91
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:45,599
that there are...

92
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:47,601
twenty-three students registered...

93
00:12:50,187 --> 00:12:54,233
for this series of lectures
on advanced musical form.

94
00:12:54,316 --> 00:12:56,777
Now, we all know that
it's not raining outside.

95
00:12:58,111 --> 00:13:02,491
Unless there's a fire in some other part
of the building we don't know about...

96
00:13:03,534 --> 00:13:06,078
there's an awful lot of people here
with nothing better to do.

97
00:13:07,955 --> 00:13:09,873
However...

98
00:13:09,957 --> 00:13:13,502
we'll know more
after the second lecture.

99
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,548
I'm sure there are many of you...

100
00:13:17,631 --> 00:13:19,550
who may recognize this.

101
00:13:51,373 --> 00:13:55,085
Sounds a little bit better
with an orchestra than a piano.

102
00:13:55,169 --> 00:13:57,421
No, you made it sound fine.
That was a great class.

103
00:13:57,504 --> 00:13:59,756
John's secret is
that he's a natural ham.

104
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,925
Don't go too far.
Excuse me.

105
00:14:02,009 --> 00:14:05,345
- If you can't find your way back-
- I'll send out a search party.

106
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:17,900
Hi. I'd like you
to meet my mother.

107
00:14:17,983 --> 00:14:19,943
- How do you do, Mrs. Norman?
- How do you do?

108
00:14:19,985 --> 00:14:23,071
This is John Russell.
You remember the Chessman house?

109
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:27,993
Oh, yes. I'm very pleased
to meet you, Mr. Russell.

110
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:30,913
- How are you liking the place?
- Fine.

111
00:14:31,955 --> 00:14:34,416
- It's so large.
- Yes.

112
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:38,086
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I have your attention, please.

113
00:14:39,129 --> 00:14:42,216
I'd like to introduce
Senator Joseph Carmichael-

114
00:14:42,299 --> 00:14:45,636
My God.
He's going to make another speech.

115
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:49,598
What you're hearing is a lifelong
Republican commenting on a Democrat.

116
00:14:51,308 --> 00:14:54,102
You know how I hate making speeches.

117
00:14:55,604 --> 00:14:58,065
But sometimes,
on a very special occasion...

118
00:14:58,148 --> 00:15:01,818
like raising money for
our magnificent symphony orchestra-

119
00:15:01,902 --> 00:15:04,196
And weren't they fantastic tonight?

120
00:15:06,615 --> 00:15:08,534
Damn right.

121
00:15:08,617 --> 00:15:12,287
- I was just going to get a drink.
- I think I'll join you.

122
00:15:12,329 --> 00:15:15,123
I'll be right back, Mother.

123
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:17,835
Thank you.

124
00:15:19,962 --> 00:15:23,674
Thank you. Actually,
he's on our board of directors...

125
00:15:23,757 --> 00:15:25,968
at the Historical Preservation Society.

126
00:15:26,009 --> 00:15:28,303
In fact, he's become
our number one philanthropist.

127
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:32,891
- So, you're getting settled in then?
- Oh, yes.

128
00:15:32,975 --> 00:15:36,728
There's some things at the Society
office that belong to your house.

129
00:15:36,812 --> 00:15:39,231
I'll see if I can
dig them up for you.

130
00:15:39,314 --> 00:15:41,233
I'm glad you took the house.

131
00:18:41,663 --> 00:18:43,165
Mr. Tuttle?

132
00:18:47,628 --> 00:18:49,213
Yes, Mr. Russell?

133
00:18:50,422 --> 00:18:52,174
You frightened me.

134
00:18:52,257 --> 00:18:56,595
Is anyone else here?
Mrs. Rissean cleaning today?

135
00:18:56,678 --> 00:18:58,847
No, sir, just me.

136
00:18:58,931 --> 00:19:00,807
Thank you.

137
00:20:39,489 --> 00:20:42,242
That's lovely- the music.

138
00:20:42,326 --> 00:20:44,828
- Well, hello.
- Hi.

139
00:20:44,912 --> 00:20:48,957
- Has the quality of a lullaby.
- Yes, it is in a sort.

140
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:52,002
Well, here we are, as promised.

141
00:20:52,044 --> 00:20:57,007
These are some assorted prints that
used to hang in the house somewhere.

142
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:58,967
And this...

143
00:20:59,009 --> 00:21:02,554
is an old restored photograph
taken at the front of the house.

144
00:21:02,638 --> 00:21:05,224
- Isn't that remarkable?
- Beautiful.

145
00:21:07,518 --> 00:21:11,480
I tried to call first, but Information
isn't giving your number out yet.

146
00:21:12,648 --> 00:21:17,027
That's a beautiful old piece.
Did you refinish it?

147
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,779
I didn't, no.

148
00:21:22,241 --> 00:21:25,035
Um, that was Kathy's,
my daughter.

149
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:36,255
Well, I guess I'd better be off.

150
00:21:36,338 --> 00:21:38,298
I hope you like the prints.

151
00:21:38,382 --> 00:21:39,967
Thank you.

152
00:21:42,219 --> 00:21:44,054
You going riding?

153
00:21:44,137 --> 00:21:46,974
Yes. Do you ride?

154
00:22:33,103 --> 00:22:34,479
What's the matter?

155
00:22:36,773 --> 00:22:39,067
I was just thinking
about my daughter, Kathy-

156
00:22:41,445 --> 00:22:43,405
how much she loved horses.

157
00:23:24,905 --> 00:23:27,157
An air lock somewhere.

158
00:23:27,241 --> 00:23:29,409
It was too loud, too rhythmic.

159
00:23:32,621 --> 00:23:35,082
Well, it's starting, at least.

160
00:23:36,959 --> 00:23:40,003
Why would it happen
two mornings in a row...

161
00:23:40,087 --> 00:23:42,005
precisely at 6:00?

162
00:23:43,173 --> 00:23:46,552
Why does it go on for half a minute
and then stop? It doesn't make sense.

163
00:23:48,178 --> 00:23:51,557
A furnace is like anything else,
Mr. Russell.

164
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,767
It's got habits.

165
00:23:53,851 --> 00:23:56,436
It's an old house.

166
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,272
It makes noises.

167
00:24:20,711 --> 00:24:22,838
Well, very good.

168
00:24:22,921 --> 00:24:26,133
We're still not together
on the off-beats...

169
00:24:26,216 --> 00:24:30,804
and, darling, you're retarding
a little too much on the last four bars.

170
00:24:30,888 --> 00:24:33,182
Otherwise, it was splendid.

171
00:24:34,433 --> 00:24:36,393
- Good night.
- Good night.

172
00:24:36,476 --> 00:24:38,061
See you tomorrow.

173
00:27:53,215 --> 00:27:54,883
What I'm driving at is...

174
00:27:54,967 --> 00:27:58,262
has anything like this
happened in the house before?

175
00:27:58,345 --> 00:28:02,933
If so, to whom, when,
and what did they do about it?

176
00:28:03,016 --> 00:28:06,687
Since I've been with the Society,
the house has been empty.

177
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:10,065
John, you're working very hard.

178
00:28:10,107 --> 00:28:12,818
You've been through
a terrible emotional strain.

179
00:28:12,901 --> 00:28:15,696
- Are you saying I'm hallucinating?
- Excuse me.

180
00:28:15,779 --> 00:28:17,072
Minnie?

181
00:28:17,156 --> 00:28:19,658
Claire, there's a call for you-
your mother.

182
00:28:19,741 --> 00:28:22,578
- Should I tell her you're busy?
- I'll be right there.

183
00:28:22,619 --> 00:28:24,580
Excuse me just for a minute.

184
00:28:32,671 --> 00:28:36,133
You know there's some question
about your lease, Mr. Russell.

185
00:28:36,175 --> 00:28:40,137
- What do you mean?
- That house shouldn't have been rented.

186
00:28:40,179 --> 00:28:44,349
Miss Norman rushed those papers
through our attorney's office.

187
00:28:44,433 --> 00:28:47,519
She did not use proper channels.

188
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:49,813
Why should anyone object?

189
00:28:51,607 --> 00:28:53,817
That house is not fit to live in.

190
00:28:55,944 --> 00:28:58,197
No one's been able to live in it.

191
00:29:00,157 --> 00:29:02,326
It doesn't want people.

192
00:29:03,577 --> 00:29:05,496
Then there has been trouble
in the house before?

193
00:36:44,329 --> 00:36:48,792
Listen, it's note for note.
Same tempo, even the same key.

194
00:36:48,834 --> 00:36:50,961
What do you think?

195
00:36:51,044 --> 00:36:54,840
I don't know.
It's a startling coincidence.

196
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:59,094
But that melody must have been
very popular at one time...

197
00:36:59,178 --> 00:37:01,054
or it wouldn't be
on the music box.

198
00:37:01,138 --> 00:37:04,308
I agree,
but I swear I never heard it...

199
00:37:04,391 --> 00:37:07,728
before I played it and recorded it
that day you came over.

200
00:37:07,811 --> 00:37:10,898
There's something-
Something.

201
00:37:10,981 --> 00:37:13,400
It's happened before here.
I'm not the first.

202
00:37:13,483 --> 00:37:16,695
I went over the files
very carefully...

203
00:37:16,778 --> 00:37:19,448
all the way back to 1920.

204
00:37:19,531 --> 00:37:23,535
- Nothing out of the ordinary.
- Miss Huxley.

205
00:37:23,619 --> 00:37:28,040
Minnie's a highly eccentric
old woman, but she'd never-

206
00:37:28,123 --> 00:37:30,792
She said the house didn't want people.
She's mistaken.

207
00:37:30,834 --> 00:37:35,130
Whatever it is is trying
desperately to communicate.

208
00:37:35,172 --> 00:37:38,050
The bangings, the water taps,
the broken window panes.

209
00:37:38,133 --> 00:37:40,928
All the glass fell outward.
It had to be done from the inside.

210
00:37:41,011 --> 00:37:43,597
Everything that's happened
has been designed...

211
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,474
to get me into that attic room.

212
00:37:47,142 --> 00:37:49,686
I want to see it.

213
00:38:06,161 --> 00:38:08,205
Look at that book
on the desk there.

214
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:22,052
"C.S.B. January 4, 1909."

215
00:38:23,887 --> 00:38:27,015
It's a little child's writing.

216
00:38:27,057 --> 00:38:29,726
1909.
Who could've lived here then?

217
00:38:33,397 --> 00:38:36,358
That's where I found the music box,
on the mantle.

218
00:38:42,156 --> 00:38:44,074
Look at this wheelchair.

219
00:38:45,242 --> 00:38:47,286
Oh, my God.

220
00:38:49,204 --> 00:38:51,540
It's so small.

221
00:38:54,334 --> 00:38:56,420
What was this room?

222
00:39:31,788 --> 00:39:35,876
Former residents:
William Sarachino and family. Architect.

223
00:39:35,959 --> 00:39:39,379
Bought the place in 1965.
Sold it in 1967.

224
00:39:39,463 --> 00:39:42,382
Purchased from the Society
for Historical Preservation...

225
00:39:42,466 --> 00:39:45,969
November, 1967, through a generous
grant from the Carmichael Foundation.

226
00:39:46,053 --> 00:39:47,679
- That's the senator?
- Yeah.

227
00:39:48,472 --> 00:39:51,975
- Great philanthropist.
- Where is the rest of this file?

228
00:39:52,059 --> 00:39:54,561
Previous occupants-

229
00:39:54,645 --> 00:39:56,688
No previous occupants listed.

230
00:39:56,772 --> 00:39:59,441
There's nothing here before 1920.

231
00:40:00,818 --> 00:40:04,446
Minnie, we're looking for
the Chessman house file, pre-1920.

232
00:40:04,530 --> 00:40:07,491
- Do you know where it is?
- What is it you want to know?

233
00:40:07,574 --> 00:40:10,244
We're trying to find out
who lived in the house in 1909.

234
00:40:13,997 --> 00:40:16,416
A man named Barnard.
A doctor.

235
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:21,380
- Did he have any children?
- I believe a son and a daughter.

236
00:40:21,463 --> 00:40:24,299
There was some kind
of family tragedy, I think.

237
00:40:24,383 --> 00:40:27,427
He sold the house in 1909.

238
00:40:27,511 --> 00:40:30,013
1909? I'll set it up for you.

239
00:40:30,097 --> 00:40:31,682
Fine.

240
00:40:34,017 --> 00:40:36,019
It's all ready to go.
The scanner's on the right.

241
00:40:36,103 --> 00:40:38,021
Thank you so much.

242
00:40:41,358 --> 00:40:43,944
Let's have a look here.

243
00:40:44,027 --> 00:40:46,321
February 9.
These are want ads.

244
00:40:47,489 --> 00:40:49,491
Financial page.

245
00:40:49,575 --> 00:40:52,286
Real estate.
More want ads.

246
00:40:56,915 --> 00:40:58,667
Wait, wait, wait.

247
00:41:03,505 --> 00:41:06,592
"Cora Barnard, seven-year-old daughter
of Dr. Walter Barnard...

248
00:41:06,675 --> 00:41:09,636
prominent Seattle physician,
was struck and seriously injured...

249
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:12,347
when she ran in front
of a passing coal cart...

250
00:41:12,431 --> 00:41:14,683
outside her Chessman Park home
yesterday.

251
00:41:14,725 --> 00:41:16,727
She was hastened to
St. Margaret's Hospital...

252
00:41:16,810 --> 00:41:18,520
where her condition remains grave."

253
00:41:18,604 --> 00:41:22,191
- So forth and so on.
- Cora Barnard.

254
00:41:22,232 --> 00:41:24,151
C.S.B.

255
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:33,202
There.

256
00:41:35,370 --> 00:41:39,082
"Cora Barnard, daughter of-

257
00:41:39,166 --> 00:41:42,503
succumbed in
St. Margaret's Hospital...

258
00:41:42,586 --> 00:41:45,297
to injuries sustained in
a February 15 accident.

259
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:47,216
She is mourned by her parents.

260
00:41:47,257 --> 00:41:50,052
Miss Barnard will be interred
in the family plot...

261
00:41:50,093 --> 00:41:52,387
in the Brookfield Cemetery."

262
00:41:55,098 --> 00:41:57,601
There's the doctor...

263
00:41:57,684 --> 00:42:00,187
and his wife.

264
00:42:00,270 --> 00:42:02,231
There's the brother, Lloyd.

265
00:42:10,656 --> 00:42:13,575
This little girl, Cora...

266
00:42:13,659 --> 00:42:17,246
was killed in the street.

267
00:42:17,329 --> 00:42:19,998
It was an accident,
almost the same as Kathy.

268
00:42:27,464 --> 00:42:29,967
What is it
in that house, Claire?

269
00:42:31,009 --> 00:42:33,262
What is it doing?
Why is it trying to reach me?

270
00:42:33,303 --> 00:42:36,098
- John-
- Is it because of my daughter?

271
00:42:39,142 --> 00:42:41,061
I can't go through all this again.

272
00:42:43,647 --> 00:42:46,108
You must get out of that house.

273
00:45:09,376 --> 00:45:12,087
I believe everything you're saying,
Mr. Russell.

274
00:45:12,171 --> 00:45:14,756
The noises, the lights,
the teleportation of objects-

275
00:45:14,798 --> 00:45:16,592
all very familiar.

276
00:45:16,633 --> 00:45:19,386
- Fascinating stuff.
- But the point is...

277
00:45:19,469 --> 00:45:22,264
what do I do now?

278
00:45:22,306 --> 00:45:24,391
I tell you, off the record.

279
00:45:24,474 --> 00:45:26,977
We have coming here...

280
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:30,939
many mediums
and spiritualists and so.

281
00:45:31,023 --> 00:45:33,275
We test them.

282
00:45:33,358 --> 00:45:37,237
Ninety-nine percent are the frauds.

283
00:45:37,321 --> 00:45:41,200
But the one percent-

284
00:45:41,283 --> 00:45:43,076
astonishing.

285
00:45:44,119 --> 00:45:46,246
A medium.

286
00:46:13,190 --> 00:46:14,817
- Mr. Russell?
- Yes.

287
00:46:14,858 --> 00:46:16,193
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

288
00:46:16,276 --> 00:46:18,278
- My wife, Leah.
- Come in, please.

289
00:46:18,362 --> 00:46:20,364
- Thank you.
- It's just to your left.

290
00:46:23,158 --> 00:46:25,619
Could we have
these lights off, please?

291
00:46:25,702 --> 00:46:27,287
Sure.

292
00:46:44,429 --> 00:46:46,598
I thought I'd record what happens.

293
00:46:46,682 --> 00:46:48,600
- Is that all right?
- Yes, of course.

294
00:46:51,395 --> 00:46:54,231
That's fine. Mr. Russell,
would you sit there, please?

295
00:46:54,314 --> 00:46:57,025
I'll sit here.
Thank you.

296
00:47:48,619 --> 00:47:51,580
You've suffered a cruel loss,
John Russell.

297
00:47:52,498 --> 00:47:54,875
You've lost a wife and child.

298
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:01,215
The presence in this house is reaching
out to you through that loss.

299
00:48:05,594 --> 00:48:09,598
The presence is very strong here.

300
00:48:16,647 --> 00:48:19,525
It is a child's presence...

301
00:48:19,608 --> 00:48:21,902
a child who is not at peace...

302
00:48:23,445 --> 00:48:25,280
who cannot rest.

303
00:48:29,660 --> 00:48:33,455
The presence is with us.

304
00:48:36,333 --> 00:48:38,919
We sense that you are with us.

305
00:48:40,295 --> 00:48:42,214
Will you talk to us?

306
00:48:45,759 --> 00:48:48,262
Will you communicate with us?

307
00:48:49,513 --> 00:48:52,391
Will you come through to us?

308
00:48:56,854 --> 00:49:00,274
Will you speak to us?

309
00:49:06,363 --> 00:49:08,949
We are here to help you.

310
00:49:13,537 --> 00:49:15,497
What is your name?

311
00:49:18,167 --> 00:49:19,960
Will you speak to us?

312
00:49:22,421 --> 00:49:23,964
Yes.

313
00:49:27,217 --> 00:49:28,844
What is your name?

314
00:49:30,637 --> 00:49:32,931
Are you the child Cora?

315
00:49:35,058 --> 00:49:39,938
Are you the child killed
by the coal cart?

316
00:49:45,068 --> 00:49:46,695
What is your name?

317
00:49:56,079 --> 00:49:57,206
Joseph.

318
00:49:58,916 --> 00:50:02,836
Did you die in this house, Joseph?

319
00:50:03,921 --> 00:50:05,839
How did you die?

320
00:50:09,426 --> 00:50:14,056
Is there someone here
you wish to communicate with?

321
00:50:24,608 --> 00:50:27,069
Help. Help. Help.

322
00:50:42,376 --> 00:50:44,795
Mr. Russell,
will you sit over here now, please?

323
00:50:57,599 --> 00:50:59,601
Will you speak to John?

324
00:51:04,022 --> 00:51:07,901
Will you tell us
why you are not at rest?

325
00:51:10,821 --> 00:51:13,448
Speak to John.

326
00:51:16,493 --> 00:51:18,620
John is with us.

327
00:51:24,126 --> 00:51:26,795
What do you want of John?

328
00:51:29,590 --> 00:51:32,342
Why do you feel no peace?

329
00:51:41,310 --> 00:51:44,480
Why do you remain
in this house, Joseph?

330
00:51:46,148 --> 00:51:48,275
What is in this house?

331
00:51:50,736 --> 00:51:52,571
Speak to John.

332
00:51:54,948 --> 00:51:56,867
John is with us.

333
00:51:58,202 --> 00:52:01,121
How did you die?

334
00:52:02,206 --> 00:52:03,916
Did you die in this house?

335
00:52:07,002 --> 00:52:09,838
Why do you remain in this house?

336
00:52:11,173 --> 00:52:13,592
How did you die?

337
00:52:15,177 --> 00:52:17,930
Joseph, did you die in this house?

338
00:53:25,789 --> 00:53:28,250
We are here to help you.

339
00:53:33,130 --> 00:53:35,048
What is your name?

340
00:53:39,845 --> 00:53:42,264
...killed by the coal cart?

341
00:53:56,820 --> 00:54:00,741
Are you the child
killed by the coal cart?

342
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:23,472
We are here to help you.

343
00:54:25,432 --> 00:54:27,518
What is your name?

344
00:54:28,977 --> 00:54:30,562
Joseph.

345
00:54:59,883 --> 00:55:02,636
Did you die in this house, Joseph?

346
00:55:02,719 --> 00:55:04,304
House.

347
00:55:07,015 --> 00:55:09,685
My room.

348
00:55:09,768 --> 00:55:11,353
Can't walk.

349
00:55:15,190 --> 00:55:19,862
Will you tell us
why you are not at rest?

350
00:55:19,945 --> 00:55:21,530
My father.

351
00:55:21,613 --> 00:55:24,283
Joseph, did you die in this house?

352
00:55:24,366 --> 00:55:27,995
- My room.
- How did you die?

353
00:55:34,042 --> 00:55:35,919
Father.

354
00:55:38,755 --> 00:55:40,924
The well.

355
00:55:41,008 --> 00:55:43,594
Ranch.

356
00:55:43,677 --> 00:55:46,346
Sacred Heart.

357
00:55:46,430 --> 00:55:49,183
My medal.

358
00:55:51,351 --> 00:55:54,229
Father, don't.

359
00:55:54,313 --> 00:55:55,522
Help.

360
00:56:40,609 --> 00:56:44,363
Body. Ranch.

361
00:56:44,446 --> 00:56:46,031
The well.

362
00:56:47,866 --> 00:56:53,580
My name- Joseph Carmichael.

363
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:05,819
Yeah.

364
00:58:05,903 --> 00:58:07,488
I'm sorry to-

365
00:58:11,575 --> 00:58:14,453
I just-
Can you come-

366
00:58:36,266 --> 00:58:40,062
Will you tell us
why you are not at rest?

367
00:58:40,938 --> 00:58:45,400
- My father.
- Joseph, did you die in this house?

368
00:58:45,442 --> 00:58:49,154
- My room.
- How did you die?

369
00:58:49,238 --> 00:58:51,907
Father, don't.

370
00:59:17,683 --> 00:59:20,269
I shouldn't have called you.
It's just that I needed someone.

371
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:29,820
I wrote some words on the paper.

372
00:59:31,613 --> 00:59:34,366
I wrote "Sacred Heart."

373
00:59:40,247 --> 00:59:43,041
There used to be
a county orphanage...

374
00:59:43,125 --> 00:59:45,919
named Sacred Heart.

375
00:59:46,003 --> 00:59:48,547
It was closed down years ago.

376
00:59:50,299 --> 00:59:51,884
What?

377
00:59:59,349 --> 01:00:02,019
Their child, Joseph Carmichael.

378
01:00:04,188 --> 01:00:07,983
He was murdered in this house
in the attic...

379
01:00:08,025 --> 01:00:10,819
and buried.

380
01:00:10,903 --> 01:00:12,654
And then an orphan-

381
01:00:12,696 --> 01:00:17,159
Stop it, John,
just for one minute, please!

382
01:01:09,253 --> 01:01:12,965
Miss Huxley's on the phone, Senator.
It's the third time this morning.

383
01:01:13,048 --> 01:01:15,759
- She says it's important.
- All right, I'll take it.

384
01:01:27,312 --> 01:01:29,231
Hello, Minnie. How are you?

385
01:01:29,314 --> 01:01:31,233
I'm fine.

386
01:01:32,442 --> 01:01:34,903
They've been
going through the files.

387
01:01:36,864 --> 01:01:38,782
Let me have that name again.

388
01:01:45,956 --> 01:01:48,709
I'm very glad to be of help,
as you know.

389
01:01:50,752 --> 01:01:52,004
Good-bye.

390
01:02:36,965 --> 01:02:39,843
This is the senator's
campaign bio, 1960.

391
01:02:39,927 --> 01:02:43,013
I got it from the main library,
had them Xerox it for me.

392
01:02:43,096 --> 01:02:46,683
- You found something?
- It's a kind of rough retrospective...

393
01:02:46,767 --> 01:02:50,103
somebody drew up when they were thinking
of turning the house into a museum.

394
01:02:50,187 --> 01:02:55,484
Richard Carmichael and family
occupied the house 1899 to 1906.

395
01:02:55,526 --> 01:02:58,695
Richard was the senator's father.

396
01:02:58,779 --> 01:03:01,490
His mother died
when he was born in 1900.

397
01:03:01,532 --> 01:03:03,826
It's all in there.

398
01:03:03,909 --> 01:03:05,828
Look at the part
about his illness.

399
01:03:07,496 --> 01:03:12,459
"Joe Carmichael, their son, at age three
was struck down by atrophic arthritis-"

400
01:03:12,543 --> 01:03:14,503
A little further down.

401
01:03:14,545 --> 01:03:18,006
"It was decided to send little Joe
to the famed Nordbach Sanatorium...

402
01:03:18,090 --> 01:03:20,133
in Basel, Switzerland,
for special therapy.

403
01:03:20,217 --> 01:03:24,471
Accompanied by his father, he embarked
for Europe in October, 1906...

404
01:03:24,555 --> 01:03:29,685
not to set foot on American soil again
until the cessation of World War I."

405
01:03:29,768 --> 01:03:32,521
See how it might have been done?

406
01:03:32,604 --> 01:03:34,523
Richard's son, a sick child...

407
01:03:34,606 --> 01:03:37,860
was murdered by his father
and buried secretly.

408
01:03:39,653 --> 01:03:41,905
Then the substitute,
a six-year-old orphan...

409
01:03:41,989 --> 01:03:44,449
was put in his place,
shipped right overseas right away...

410
01:03:44,533 --> 01:03:47,661
with the father attending-
it all worked for them.

411
01:03:47,703 --> 01:03:51,623
Even the war worked. It kept him
in Switzerland till 1918.

412
01:03:51,707 --> 01:03:53,876
He came back here,
he was 18 years old.

413
01:03:53,959 --> 01:03:56,670
Who was gonna know
he wasn't the real son?

414
01:03:56,712 --> 01:03:59,214
If he wasn't crippled anymore,
it was because he was cured.

415
01:04:01,216 --> 01:04:05,304
Do you think he knows about
the murder and the replacement?

416
01:04:05,387 --> 01:04:07,139
I don't know.

417
01:04:07,222 --> 01:04:10,142
How could any father
do such a thing?

418
01:04:12,269 --> 01:04:15,772
Richard's wife was Emily Spencer,
the daughter of H.T. Spencer...

419
01:04:15,856 --> 01:04:19,067
who founded
the Spencer Carmichael empire.

420
01:04:19,109 --> 01:04:24,072
He died in 1905.
He was a zillionaire. His will-

421
01:04:24,114 --> 01:04:26,325
his will might be very interesting.

422
01:04:26,408 --> 01:04:28,994
There must be a copy of it
in the hall of records.

423
01:04:29,077 --> 01:04:33,457
I'm also going to find out if there was
a Spencer or Carmichael ranch somewhere.

424
01:04:34,416 --> 01:04:37,002
Yeah- a ranch with a well.

425
01:04:42,257 --> 01:04:44,593
This is the 1908 atlas of Seattle...

426
01:04:44,635 --> 01:04:47,846
which is open to the part of the city
where the Carmichael ranch was located.

427
01:04:47,930 --> 01:04:49,890
- Right here.
- What does that little mark there mean?

428
01:04:51,642 --> 01:04:55,938
According to the legend here, that was
the location of a well on the property.

429
01:04:56,021 --> 01:04:58,774
- I see.
- And in the 1914 atlas...

430
01:04:58,857 --> 01:05:01,985
which is opened here
to the same area...

431
01:05:02,069 --> 01:05:05,572
there's been one large lot
that's apparently been sold off...

432
01:05:05,656 --> 01:05:08,742
but the property is very much the same,
and the well's still there.

433
01:05:08,826 --> 01:05:13,288
- Right. Exactly.
- The 1928 atlas was quite a change.

434
01:05:13,372 --> 01:05:15,749
There's further subdivision
of the property.

435
01:05:15,791 --> 01:05:18,252
The symbol for the well has
disappeared...

436
01:05:18,293 --> 01:05:20,754
and a house has been built here.

437
01:06:15,476 --> 01:06:18,353
The ranch is listed in the will...

438
01:06:18,437 --> 01:06:22,399
part of the inheritance of little Joseph
Carmichael, all of five years old.

439
01:06:22,483 --> 01:06:24,359
He got just about everything.

440
01:06:24,401 --> 01:06:27,863
- What about the father, Richard?
- Bypassed...

441
01:06:27,946 --> 01:06:31,325
except as his son's guardian,
and therefore trustee of the estate.

442
01:06:31,366 --> 01:06:33,869
Well, old man Spencer's daughter
was dead...

443
01:06:33,911 --> 01:06:36,288
and, obviously, he wasn't
too fond of his son-in-law.

444
01:06:37,706 --> 01:06:40,876
Yes, but wait.
Richard doesn't get any money...

445
01:06:40,959 --> 01:06:45,130
but he still controls his son,
and his son is worth a fortune...

446
01:06:45,214 --> 01:06:47,049
unless-

447
01:06:47,090 --> 01:06:51,470
unless, for some reason, the boy dies
before attaining the age of 21.

448
01:06:51,553 --> 01:06:54,014
In that case,
the entire estate goes to charity.

449
01:06:55,057 --> 01:06:56,892
That would have shut Richard out
completely...

450
01:06:56,975 --> 01:06:58,852
and there he was
with a son who was...

451
01:06:58,894 --> 01:07:01,730
weak, sickly, bedridden-
couldn't even walk.

452
01:07:03,190 --> 01:07:06,485
He must have decided
not to take a chance on the boy.

453
01:07:06,568 --> 01:07:09,363
The money was just too tempting.

454
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:31,426
What are you gonna tell her?

455
01:07:31,510 --> 01:07:34,221
About the well under the house
and the body.

456
01:07:34,263 --> 01:07:37,558
- And the medal with the name on it?
- No. Nothing about Carmichael.

457
01:07:38,809 --> 01:07:42,271
- She'll think you're crazy.
- You'll tell her I'm not.

458
01:07:50,612 --> 01:07:52,656
Good evening, Mrs. Grey.
I'm John Russell.

459
01:07:52,739 --> 01:07:54,158
This is Miss Norman.

460
01:08:01,874 --> 01:08:06,170
Mr. Russell, I wouldn't have listened
to your story for two minutes...

461
01:08:06,253 --> 01:08:09,882
I wouldn't have let you in here
but for something you said on the phone.

462
01:08:10,966 --> 01:08:15,804
You said this seance affair of yours
happened three nights ago.

463
01:08:15,846 --> 01:08:17,139
- Right?
- That's right.

464
01:08:18,265 --> 01:08:22,394
Well, three nights ago,
on Monday night...

465
01:08:22,478 --> 01:08:27,483
Linda, my daughter,
woke up screaming...

466
01:08:27,566 --> 01:08:29,818
just after midnight.

467
01:08:29,860 --> 01:08:31,820
She'd had a nightmare.

468
01:08:31,862 --> 01:08:35,073
When I went in to her,
she was hysterical, she was sobbing.

469
01:08:35,157 --> 01:08:37,618
I'd never seen her like that before.

470
01:08:37,659 --> 01:08:40,204
Oh, I mean, she'd had nightmares
before, but not-

471
01:08:42,831 --> 01:08:46,585
She said she'd seen a boy-

472
01:08:46,668 --> 01:08:50,297
very small, very thin...

473
01:08:50,339 --> 01:08:52,299
almost gnomelike-

474
01:08:52,341 --> 01:08:55,677
and he was trying to come up
through the floor.

475
01:08:57,721 --> 01:08:59,890
He kept staring at her.

476
01:09:02,643 --> 01:09:04,561
Here, in the middle.

477
01:09:05,938 --> 01:09:09,858
She hasn't been in this room since,
won't come near it. She sleeps with me.

478
01:09:09,900 --> 01:09:11,985
What we want, is-

479
01:09:12,069 --> 01:09:15,322
What you want, Mr. Russell,
is to tear this room apart.

480
01:09:18,992 --> 01:09:21,662
Well, I have your phone number.
I'll have to think about it.

481
01:11:21,323 --> 01:11:24,117
What the hell's going on?
Linda!

482
01:11:42,177 --> 01:11:44,263
They're still digging...

483
01:11:44,346 --> 01:11:46,765
but they found the well.

484
01:11:46,849 --> 01:11:48,267
Okay.

485
01:11:53,939 --> 01:11:56,608
- Did you find anything?
- No, nothing yet.

486
01:11:56,692 --> 01:11:59,570
This is Tony, Mrs. Grey's son.
Miss Norman.

487
01:11:59,653 --> 01:12:01,071
- Hello.
- Hi.

488
01:12:08,787 --> 01:12:10,205
Thanks.

489
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:34,146
- Gimme that flashlight, will you?
- Sure.

490
01:12:34,229 --> 01:12:35,981
I think I found something.

491
01:12:37,483 --> 01:12:38,901
What is it?

492
01:12:51,580 --> 01:12:53,499
It's a hand.

493
01:12:53,582 --> 01:12:54,833
What?

494
01:12:57,044 --> 01:12:58,670
It's a hand.

495
01:13:00,005 --> 01:13:01,924
I'll call the police.

496
01:13:09,807 --> 01:13:11,975
Nothing more?

497
01:13:12,059 --> 01:13:13,769
Doesn't look like it.

498
01:13:13,811 --> 01:13:15,813
You think there might be
something else down there?

499
01:13:17,940 --> 01:13:21,527
Assistant coroner said those bones
had been down there maybe 50 years.

500
01:13:21,610 --> 01:13:23,529
Do you have some idea
who that child was?

501
01:13:23,612 --> 01:13:25,572
No, not really.

502
01:13:25,614 --> 01:13:27,449
What's "not really" mean?

503
01:13:31,995 --> 01:13:34,414
I'm gonna want
statements from everybody.

504
01:13:34,456 --> 01:13:36,792
Mrs. Grey, do you have some other
place you could stay for tonight?

505
01:13:36,834 --> 01:13:39,294
- Yes, it's all been arranged.
- Good.

506
01:13:50,722 --> 01:13:52,641
I think you should have told them.

507
01:13:52,724 --> 01:13:54,726
It's gotta be there.

508
01:13:54,810 --> 01:13:56,812
Without that medal,
there's no evidence, there's nothing.

509
01:13:56,895 --> 01:14:00,357
- You have the tape.
- Tapes can be altered.

510
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:02,484
They know that.
Did you see the expression on his face?

511
01:14:03,318 --> 01:14:05,279
It was obvious you were
holding something back.

512
01:14:05,320 --> 01:14:06,822
I'll say.

513
01:14:07,531 --> 01:14:10,993
Look, it's very late. Get some rest,
and I'll talk to you in the morning.

514
01:14:11,034 --> 01:14:13,328
- Fine. Drive careful.
- You too.

515
01:17:11,340 --> 01:17:12,591
What's the matter?

516
01:17:19,348 --> 01:17:23,769
"St. Paul's Church
September 8, 1900...

517
01:17:23,852 --> 01:17:25,979
Joseph Patrick Carmichael."

518
01:17:26,730 --> 01:17:28,023
It was there.

519
01:17:28,106 --> 01:17:29,942
It was there.

520
01:17:33,612 --> 01:17:39,076
You have to show it to the police.
It's the only piece of solid evidence.

521
01:17:39,159 --> 01:17:42,663
They didn't find it or see me dig it up.
Why should they believe it was there?

522
01:17:42,704 --> 01:17:44,498
You can't just ignore them.

523
01:17:45,999 --> 01:17:49,253
The police aren't going to trouble
themselves with a 70-year-old case.

524
01:17:50,087 --> 01:17:53,173
- Still, it's an unsolved murder.
- Nah.

525
01:17:53,257 --> 01:17:56,135
Whatever's to be done
has to be done by me.

526
01:17:56,218 --> 01:17:58,804
I've got to get to Carmichael.

527
01:17:58,887 --> 01:18:00,722
- He won't see you now.
- He'll see me.

528
01:18:07,896 --> 01:18:10,023
Senator!

529
01:18:10,107 --> 01:18:13,318
- Hey, hold it right there! Hold up.
- Mr. Carmichael! Senator-

530
01:18:13,402 --> 01:18:15,696
- Wait a minute, now.
- Get the hell out of my way.

531
01:18:15,737 --> 01:18:17,531
Senator, I'm John Russell.

532
01:18:17,573 --> 01:18:20,993
I'm living in your house.
Senator, look.

533
01:18:21,076 --> 01:18:24,746
I want to show him that.
I want to talk to him. Let me go!

534
01:18:24,788 --> 01:18:26,165
Senator!

535
01:18:26,248 --> 01:18:27,708
Look at this medal.

536
01:18:27,791 --> 01:18:29,751
It's a baptism medal.

537
01:18:29,793 --> 01:18:31,461
- It's got your name on it.
- You got him?

538
01:18:31,545 --> 01:18:33,547
- We got him.
- It was buried with the body.

539
01:18:35,591 --> 01:18:37,759
A little boy.

540
01:18:38,802 --> 01:18:40,929
The police know about it.

541
01:18:50,147 --> 01:18:52,608
Who was that?
Some kind of crackpot?

542
01:18:52,649 --> 01:18:56,528
I've no idea.
Never mind. Come on.

543
01:19:01,575 --> 01:19:07,247
Dale, I want you to radio back
to police headquarters...

544
01:19:07,289 --> 01:19:09,541
Captain DeWitt.

545
01:19:09,625 --> 01:19:13,253
Ask him to call me in Spokane
at this number.

546
01:19:13,295 --> 01:19:14,922
Yes, sir.

547
01:20:03,178 --> 01:20:05,597
You goddamn son of a bitch.

548
01:20:06,932 --> 01:20:08,851
What is it you want?

549
01:20:10,477 --> 01:20:12,479
What do you want from me?

550
01:20:14,022 --> 01:20:16,400
I've done everything I can do!

551
01:20:19,778 --> 01:20:21,697
There's nothing more to do.

552
01:21:02,321 --> 01:21:05,282
- Mr. Russell?
- Yes?

553
01:21:05,365 --> 01:21:08,744
- My name is DeWitt, Captain DeWitt.
- Oh, yes.

554
01:21:08,827 --> 01:21:11,997
- I'd like to talk to you if I may.
- All right. Come in.

555
01:21:19,671 --> 01:21:22,090
- Quite a house.
- Yes.

556
01:21:24,885 --> 01:21:28,222
You're a musician, a composer-
is that right, Mr. Russell?

557
01:21:28,263 --> 01:21:29,389
Yes.

558
01:21:29,431 --> 01:21:32,518
You're teaching a course at the faculty
of music out of the university?

559
01:21:32,601 --> 01:21:34,061
That's right.

560
01:21:35,604 --> 01:21:38,357
Is this where you held your seance?

561
01:21:38,440 --> 01:21:40,943
What was it you wanted
to talk to me about?

562
01:21:45,489 --> 01:21:48,283
You were out at Boeing Airfield
this morning, Mr. Russell.

563
01:21:48,325 --> 01:21:50,285
They tell me you caused
quite a scene-

564
01:21:50,327 --> 01:21:53,288
screaming, yelling,
acting like a lunatic.

565
01:21:54,331 --> 01:21:58,627
Sergeant Durban tells me you were up to
some strange things last night too.

566
01:21:59,545 --> 01:22:02,548
Seems you dug up some bones
under a lady's house...

567
01:22:02,631 --> 01:22:06,552
that some ghostly voice told you
were there, is that correct?

568
01:22:06,635 --> 01:22:10,848
Only Sergeant Durban said
you told him you had no idea...

569
01:22:10,931 --> 01:22:13,142
who those bones were-
no idea at all.

570
01:22:13,225 --> 01:22:18,313
Now, it seems a little odd, then,
don't you think...

571
01:22:18,397 --> 01:22:20,732
that you'd go charging across
that airfield this morning...

572
01:22:20,816 --> 01:22:23,610
making crazy accusations
against Senator Carmichael?

573
01:22:23,652 --> 01:22:26,989
- I made no accusations.
- The senator has served this state...

574
01:22:27,072 --> 01:22:29,408
- for 36 years and is not about to...
- I told you-

575
01:22:29,491 --> 01:22:32,661
- give in to a dirty blackmail scheme.
- Blackmail?

576
01:22:32,744 --> 01:22:34,663
- You heard me.
- What are you talking about?

577
01:22:40,544 --> 01:22:43,630
I understand you lost your wife
and daughter a little while ago.

578
01:22:43,714 --> 01:22:47,009
Maybe it shook you up-
maybe too much.

579
01:22:47,092 --> 01:22:49,303
Maybe you need help.

580
01:22:51,054 --> 01:22:53,765
- I'd like you to leave now.
- We can see that you get it.

581
01:22:55,517 --> 01:22:57,769
- Do you understand what I'm saying?
- Out, now.

582
01:22:57,853 --> 01:22:59,271
Listen to me, Russell.

583
01:23:02,608 --> 01:23:06,028
You've got something of the senator's.
He wants it back.

584
01:23:06,111 --> 01:23:09,781
It's a little gold medal,
a family heirloom. He lost it.

585
01:23:11,200 --> 01:23:12,701
He thinks you've got it.

586
01:23:15,162 --> 01:23:17,080
I don't know
what you're talking about.

587
01:23:22,419 --> 01:23:26,256
I'm sorry to barge in on you like this,
but I am so damn mad.

588
01:23:26,340 --> 01:23:27,966
This mor-

589
01:23:28,050 --> 01:23:30,886
This is Captain DeWitt,
he's with the police.

590
01:23:30,969 --> 01:23:33,222
You're Miss Norman?

591
01:23:34,389 --> 01:23:35,474
Yes.

592
01:23:38,268 --> 01:23:41,104
I take it now, or I come back in an hour
with a warrant and a crew...

593
01:23:41,188 --> 01:23:42,856
and we tear this place apart.

594
01:23:43,816 --> 01:23:45,400
"Tear this place apart"?

595
01:23:45,484 --> 01:23:47,820
- What's going on here?
- I'll be here.

596
01:23:50,572 --> 01:23:51,990
Suit yourself.

597
01:23:56,078 --> 01:23:58,038
Well, what was that all about?

598
01:23:58,080 --> 01:24:01,208
Senator Carmichael thinks
he's being blackmailed.

599
01:24:05,546 --> 01:24:10,676
They canceled your lease and forced me
to resign from the society.

600
01:24:10,759 --> 01:24:14,429
No explanation, no reason, nothing,
just "get out."

601
01:24:14,513 --> 01:24:17,599
I have an appointment with the head
of the board of directors.

602
01:24:17,683 --> 01:24:19,560
I'll see what I can find out.

603
01:24:19,601 --> 01:24:21,937
I'll call you and let you know.

604
01:25:50,567 --> 01:25:53,529
Yes? Yes, Claire?

605
01:25:53,612 --> 01:25:56,740
I was driving by,
and I recognized the car.

606
01:25:56,824 --> 01:25:59,409
I don't know how it happened.
I don't know how it could have happened.

607
01:25:59,493 --> 01:26:01,370
There are no other cars.
There's nothing.

608
01:26:01,411 --> 01:26:04,331
It's upside-down
in the middle of the road.

609
01:26:04,373 --> 01:26:07,417
It's that man- that policeman
who was just at your house.

610
01:26:07,501 --> 01:26:09,628
DeWitt. He's dead.

611
01:26:51,336 --> 01:26:53,380
Carmichael. Any messages?

612
01:26:54,798 --> 01:26:57,551
Oh, yes. Captain DeWitt.
What'd he say?

613
01:27:01,346 --> 01:27:02,598
What?

614
01:27:05,184 --> 01:27:06,435
Yeah.

615
01:27:10,481 --> 01:27:11,940
Oh, my God.

616
01:27:13,525 --> 01:27:15,027
What?

617
01:27:15,944 --> 01:27:19,698
Who? Russell.

618
01:27:23,577 --> 01:27:25,162
All right.

619
01:27:27,122 --> 01:27:29,082
Let me have that number.

620
01:27:45,724 --> 01:27:48,477
- John Russell.
- The senator's expecting you.

621
01:28:10,916 --> 01:28:12,835
- Still busy?
- Yes.

622
01:28:23,178 --> 01:28:26,849
- Where are you going? Claire-
- I'll be back in a little while, Mom.

623
01:28:39,027 --> 01:28:41,655
All right.
Just what the hell do you want?

624
01:28:42,698 --> 01:28:44,616
You must have some idea.

625
01:28:46,118 --> 01:28:48,370
Well, I'm a busy man.
Make it fast.

626
01:28:53,083 --> 01:28:54,918
The house on Chessman Park-

627
01:28:56,003 --> 01:28:58,672
your family lived there
until 1906.

628
01:29:01,216 --> 01:29:04,678
It's had a history
of strange happenings.

629
01:29:05,721 --> 01:29:08,849
There's something in that house,
a manifestation.

630
01:29:10,726 --> 01:29:13,312
This afternoon, Captain DeWitt
came to see me...

631
01:29:13,395 --> 01:29:16,398
presumably on your behalf...

632
01:29:16,482 --> 01:29:20,194
so you must have known what's happened,
at least as much as DeWitt could say-

633
01:29:21,153 --> 01:29:26,909
the disturbances, the seance,
the bones found in the well.

634
01:29:29,077 --> 01:29:31,497
I tried to talk to you
at the airport.

635
01:29:32,581 --> 01:29:34,249
I showed you this.

636
01:29:39,046 --> 01:29:40,964
DeWitt said you'd lost it.

637
01:29:43,801 --> 01:29:45,761
I found it in the grave...

638
01:29:46,970 --> 01:29:48,680
where the child was buried.

639
01:29:52,976 --> 01:29:56,939
There's no logical explanation
for what I'm going to say to you now.

640
01:29:58,524 --> 01:30:01,777
The boy was badly crippled.

641
01:30:01,860 --> 01:30:03,403
I believe he was killed...

642
01:30:03,487 --> 01:30:05,948
in an attic room of that house.

643
01:30:12,287 --> 01:30:13,956
I saw what happened...

644
01:30:16,834 --> 01:30:19,795
and I believe it was
Richard Carmichael, your father...

645
01:30:22,256 --> 01:30:24,216
who murdered the boy,
his natural son...

646
01:30:24,299 --> 01:30:25,884
Joseph Carmichael.

647
01:30:28,720 --> 01:30:32,474
Then there was a substitution
from the Sacred Heart Orphanage.

648
01:30:32,558 --> 01:30:34,810
The boy was taken to Europe...

649
01:30:34,852 --> 01:30:39,940
cured miraculously
and returned to inherit an empire.

650
01:30:41,567 --> 01:30:43,485
That changeling was you.

651
01:30:57,666 --> 01:31:01,378
So, that's your story.

652
01:31:01,461 --> 01:31:03,380
Whatever you want to call it.

653
01:31:08,177 --> 01:31:11,430
- How much?
- My God.

654
01:31:11,513 --> 01:31:14,850
All right, how much do you want
for this farce that you've concocted?

655
01:31:14,892 --> 01:31:16,810
This isn't blackmail.

656
01:31:16,852 --> 01:31:19,521
I've been dealing with
vermin like you for years.

657
01:31:19,605 --> 01:31:24,526
You wait your chance, then you come in
with a story so patently incredible-

658
01:31:24,568 --> 01:31:25,986
Truth terrifies you, doesn't it?

659
01:31:26,028 --> 01:31:28,780
It's the truth.
It won't be buried.

660
01:31:28,864 --> 01:31:31,742
- Get out.
- None of this belongs to you.

661
01:31:31,825 --> 01:31:34,203
Get out of here
with your filthy lies.

662
01:31:34,244 --> 01:31:38,123
I should have gone to that dead child.
You suspected something all your life.

663
01:31:38,207 --> 01:31:42,252
You're not Joseph Carmichael. You're
the beneficiary of the cruelest murder-

664
01:31:42,336 --> 01:31:43,712
murder for profit.

665
01:31:47,216 --> 01:31:49,968
My father was not a murderer.

666
01:31:51,386 --> 01:31:53,722
Nobody in this world can say that.

667
01:31:56,058 --> 01:31:59,394
My father was a great man.

668
01:31:59,478 --> 01:32:01,355
He was a loving man.

669
01:32:02,940 --> 01:32:07,069
And for you to come in here
and accuse him of-

670
01:32:10,989 --> 01:32:12,991
How can you?

671
01:32:15,911 --> 01:32:17,871
Damn you!

672
01:32:20,916 --> 01:32:24,753
I will not allow you
to slander his good name.

673
01:32:34,555 --> 01:32:37,599
These documents are on file
with the city.

674
01:32:40,227 --> 01:32:42,187
This is a tape of the seance.

675
01:32:44,148 --> 01:32:46,108
There's no copy.

676
01:32:47,484 --> 01:32:49,736
Take it.
I've done what I had to do.

677
01:32:56,451 --> 01:32:57,786
I'm sorry.

678
01:33:02,541 --> 01:33:06,253
If I find that you've breathed
one word of this-

679
01:33:06,295 --> 01:33:07,588
one word-

680
01:33:07,629 --> 01:33:10,132
to anyone...

681
01:33:10,215 --> 01:33:13,510
you'll wish you'd never
come into this world.

682
01:33:36,325 --> 01:33:37,993
What was all that shouting about?

683
01:33:38,744 --> 01:33:40,329
Nothing.

684
01:33:41,580 --> 01:33:42,831
Get out.

685
01:33:42,915 --> 01:33:44,833
Leave me alone.

686
01:34:30,379 --> 01:34:33,549
John, I've tried to ca-

687
01:34:45,060 --> 01:34:47,729
This isn't like me.

688
01:34:47,813 --> 01:34:49,982
John, where are you?

689
01:35:05,581 --> 01:35:07,541
John, what are you doing?

690
01:35:52,586 --> 01:35:55,798
Please.
I don't wanna come up there.

691
01:36:51,311 --> 01:36:53,313
I followed you.
I followed you.

692
01:37:04,575 --> 01:37:08,579
I thought you were here.
I kept calling and calling you.

693
01:37:10,205 --> 01:37:11,874
It's okay. Calm down.

694
01:37:11,957 --> 01:37:15,544
- I want you to wait in the car for me.
- No, you're not going back in there!

695
01:37:15,627 --> 01:37:18,672
- No, please, please, don't!
- Claire, Claire.

696
01:37:18,714 --> 01:37:20,883
Get ahold of yourself. Go on.

697
01:37:20,966 --> 01:37:22,384
I'll be right back.
Don't worry.

698
01:37:26,346 --> 01:37:28,348
Joseph, no!

699
01:39:02,901 --> 01:39:04,444
Father.

700
01:39:11,827 --> 01:39:13,996
My medal.

701
01:41:04,231 --> 01:41:06,358
Father, don't.

702
01:41:07,359 --> 01:41:08,777
Help.
