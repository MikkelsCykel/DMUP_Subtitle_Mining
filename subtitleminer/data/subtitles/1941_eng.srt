1
00:02:29,773 --> 00:02:32,105
Oh! Oh!

2
00:05:58,015 --> 00:06:01,610
Hollywood!

3
00:06:27,377 --> 00:06:32,041
Hollywood!

4
00:07:22,745 --> 00:07:27,273
Get your mind off that dame and back on
the job or we'll never get outta here.

5
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:29,284
This war's been goin' on
for the last ten years.

6
00:07:29,352 --> 00:07:31,445
You had Japs
in Manchuria in 1931,

7
00:07:31,521 --> 00:07:33,682
the Eye-ties
in Ethiopia in 1935,

8
00:07:33,756 --> 00:07:37,385
the Krauts been blitzkrieging your favorite
European tourist attractions the last 3 years.

9
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:40,156
Last year in Africa, it took General
O'Connor and his British tanks two months...

10
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:43,495
to grab Libya and it took
Rommel 12 days to get it back.

11
00:07:43,566 --> 00:07:46,228
Jesus!
Look at this creamation!

12
00:07:46,302 --> 00:07:48,236
You're supposed to be drying
dishes, not killing people.

13
00:07:48,304 --> 00:07:50,795
Give me that turkey leg.
I'll shove it up your ass.

14
00:07:50,874 --> 00:07:52,865
What's the matter with you?
Look at all this good food over here.

15
00:07:52,942 --> 00:07:57,879
- Pop, Wally made me cook!
- Wally, my ass! Looka here! Perfectly good eggs!

16
00:07:57,947 --> 00:08:00,609
What the hell's the matter with you,
throwing away food like that?

17
00:08:00,683 --> 00:08:03,652
Put it back over the stove,
warm it up for them fellows out there.

18
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:07,656
Let's mutilate this food before
they can serve it to anyone else.

19
00:08:07,724 --> 00:08:09,919
They are so disgusting.

20
00:08:09,993 --> 00:08:11,927
If you don't quit hanging
around with that playboy,

21
00:08:11,995 --> 00:08:14,520
you gonna end up with a record
you can't play on the jukebox.

22
00:08:14,597 --> 00:08:16,531
- But, Pops-
- Pops? I ain't your Pops!

23
00:08:16,599 --> 00:08:20,000
But, Pops, I've been practicin'
all week. I'm takin' dancing lessons.

24
00:08:20,069 --> 00:08:23,334
- I seen you dance.
You can't dance worth a spit.

25
00:08:23,406 --> 00:08:25,340
Give me that thing.
Jesus.

26
00:08:25,408 --> 00:08:28,104
When are you gonna remember which side
of the tracks you come from, boy?

27
00:08:28,177 --> 00:08:30,407
- We need more coffee.
- Coming right up.

28
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:34,746
Clean that place up right there!

29
00:08:41,724 --> 00:08:44,318
What's your problem, kid?
You got ants in your pants?

30
00:08:44,394 --> 00:08:46,624
I was just practicing
some dance steps.

31
00:08:46,696 --> 00:08:48,630
- Dance steps?
- Mm-hmm.

32
00:08:48,698 --> 00:08:51,633
You got somethin' to be
dancin' about, bub?

33
00:08:51,701 --> 00:08:54,033
- I don't know. Maybe I do.
- Maybe you do?

34
00:08:54,103 --> 00:08:57,903
There's a war on, pal. I want to know
why you're not in uniform.

35
00:08:57,974 --> 00:09:00,135
I want to know what you're
doin' dancin' around tables.

36
00:09:00,209 --> 00:09:02,234
I want to know why
you're not in the Army.

37
00:09:02,312 --> 00:09:05,543
- 'Cause I don't take orders from anybody.
- A tough guy, huh?

38
00:09:05,615 --> 00:09:07,947
Whoa!

39
00:09:08,017 --> 00:09:11,748
Are you okay? I'm really sorry.

40
00:09:11,821 --> 00:09:15,188
- I'm terribly sorry.
- You got egg on my uniform.

41
00:09:15,258 --> 00:09:17,920
- I'm very sorry.
- I hate eggs.

42
00:09:17,994 --> 00:09:21,259
- Eggs are good for you.
- I can't stand eggs. I hate eggs.

43
00:09:21,331 --> 00:09:24,266
- Look out, Wally.
- Watch it! He's got a leg.

44
00:09:24,334 --> 00:09:28,065
That ain't the way you do it!

45
00:09:28,137 --> 00:09:30,071
Can it, Sitarski!
Save it for the Japs!

46
00:09:30,139 --> 00:09:32,164
For cryin' out loud, Sarge.
Look at this bozo.

47
00:09:32,241 --> 00:09:34,175
Anybody who wears a shirt
like that is askin' for it.

48
00:09:34,243 --> 00:09:36,211
He's an American, Sitarski.

49
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:38,713
If it's one thing we don't want, it's
seeing Americans fighting Americans.

50
00:09:38,781 --> 00:09:41,045
I won't stand for that.
Not here, not anywhere.

51
00:09:41,117 --> 00:09:43,642
We've had our chow.
Move out.

52
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:47,212
- You okay, kid?
- You're not gonna tip him, are ya, Sarge?

53
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:50,623
- That's okay. I don't need your tip.
- I think you do.

54
00:09:50,693 --> 00:09:53,355
Get rid of that shirt.
It's in bad taste.

55
00:09:53,429 --> 00:09:55,989
Come on! Clean them floors up
like I told ya!

56
00:09:56,065 --> 00:09:58,659
Floors haven't been washed
in 10 years. It'll take me all night.

57
00:09:58,735 --> 00:10:01,795
I don't give a damn
if it takes 20 years.

58
00:10:01,871 --> 00:10:04,066
He can't work tonight.
Tonight's his big night.

59
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:06,734
- Tonight's the night of the Jitterbug contest.
- Jitterbug? Hell!

60
00:10:06,809 --> 00:10:08,777
That reminds me. Kill them
cockroaches in that flour sack.

61
00:10:08,845 --> 00:10:12,747
Pop, he can't work. He's gotta dance!

62
00:10:12,815 --> 00:10:15,750
Pop! Pop!
You can't do this to me!

63
00:10:15,818 --> 00:10:19,879
I'll do anything! I gotta get
that money! I gotta get that suit!

64
00:10:19,956 --> 00:10:22,322
Only way you'll get a suit
is steal one.

65
00:10:22,392 --> 00:10:25,828
- Now scram! Get out!
- Ow! Oh!

66
00:10:25,895 --> 00:10:29,763
Easy come, easy go.

67
00:10:29,832 --> 00:10:33,199
Oh, no, you think
that's gonna stop me?

68
00:10:33,269 --> 00:10:38,206
Nothing's gonna stop me from being
with Betty Douglas tonight.

69
00:10:38,274 --> 00:10:40,674
- Um, Miss Fitzroy?
- Yes, Betty?

70
00:10:40,743 --> 00:10:44,736
Does this mean we won't be allowed
to dance with civilians tonight?

71
00:10:44,814 --> 00:10:47,374
That is correct.

72
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:51,853
In fact, civilians will no longer
be permitted in this facility.

73
00:10:51,921 --> 00:10:56,324
The world is changing, girls,
and we have to change with it.

74
00:10:56,392 --> 00:10:58,690
These men in uniform
are after one thing-

75
00:10:58,761 --> 00:11:01,992
I don't want to hear any more talk
about your precious morality.

76
00:11:02,065 --> 00:11:04,693
Morale. Now that
is what is important.

77
00:11:04,767 --> 00:11:07,861
You are gonna have
to smile at men...

78
00:11:07,937 --> 00:11:10,804
who you would never give
a second glance to in peacetime.

79
00:11:10,873 --> 00:11:12,898
Yes, Miss Fitzroy.

80
00:11:12,975 --> 00:11:15,910
Make polite conversation with men
whose minds are in the gutter.

81
00:11:15,978 --> 00:11:17,969
Yes, Miss Fitzroy.

82
00:11:18,047 --> 00:11:21,949
You are gonna have to dance and dance
close with men you might find repulsive.

83
00:11:22,018 --> 00:11:23,952
Eww!

84
00:11:32,028 --> 00:11:37,261
Oh, heaven, heaven.
Some of them are really cute!

85
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:40,234
I want you!

86
00:11:40,303 --> 00:11:41,736
Eight o'clock!

87
00:11:41,804 --> 00:11:43,237
I can't take it!

88
00:11:43,306 --> 00:11:45,035
- Seven-thirty!
- I love you!

89
00:11:45,108 --> 00:11:46,905
Tonight!

90
00:11:46,976 --> 00:11:49,240
I love you!

91
00:11:52,281 --> 00:11:57,412
That's all Reed Jack, one of our
better boogie-woogie suits.

92
00:11:57,487 --> 00:12:01,423
- And very expensive.
- Excuse me. What do you mean by that?

93
00:12:01,491 --> 00:12:05,587
It's just that I couldn't help noticing
what you were wearing when you came in.

94
00:12:05,661 --> 00:12:09,461
My good man, are you accusing me of not
having enough dough to pay for this?

95
00:12:09,532 --> 00:12:11,932
- Shh!
- I might as well leave this store.

96
00:12:12,001 --> 00:12:15,528
No. Come back. Try on the hat.
It goes with the suit.

97
00:12:15,605 --> 00:12:18,267
You know what I mean?

98
00:12:23,045 --> 00:12:27,004
It's not gonna work. It ain't
gonna work. It's not gonna work.

99
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:29,142
Elsewhere
in the news, it's been reported...

100
00:12:29,218 --> 00:12:33,348
that two squadrons of Japanese planes
flew over San Francisco last night.

101
00:12:33,422 --> 00:12:37,892
They bombed Pearl Harbor.
Now they're going to come here.

102
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:41,521
They bombed Pearl Harbor!
Now they're going to come here!

103
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:46,529
Thank you, but no, thank you.
I have changed my mind.

104
00:12:46,602 --> 00:12:49,662
- I do not want it!
- What do you mean you changed your mind?

105
00:12:49,739 --> 00:12:52,606
- I'm sorry, sir. I am taking it off.
- But you wanted a suit.

106
00:12:52,675 --> 00:12:56,907
I learned one thing today:
I will never shop east of Beverly Hills.

107
00:12:56,979 --> 00:13:00,574
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas.

108
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:03,210
It ain't gonna work.

109
00:13:03,286 --> 00:13:04,776
Why do I always have troubles
on Christmas-

110
00:13:04,854 --> 00:13:08,119
It's not gonna work.

111
00:13:08,191 --> 00:13:12,685
- Why can't I have a-
What? Oh, my God.

112
00:13:12,762 --> 00:13:15,993
God.

113
00:13:19,802 --> 00:13:23,397
Air raid.
Japs. Japs!

114
00:13:23,472 --> 00:13:26,407
Japs!

115
00:13:26,475 --> 00:13:29,467
Get outta my way!

116
00:13:29,545 --> 00:13:33,845
Air raid!

117
00:13:33,916 --> 00:13:36,510
I never thought
they'd be this nervous.

118
00:13:36,586 --> 00:13:40,044
Hi, girls. Your first air raid?
Are you two sisters?

119
00:13:40,122 --> 00:13:43,148
- Get lost!
- We want a man!

120
00:13:43,226 --> 00:13:45,353
Soldier! Soldier!
Help us!

121
00:13:45,428 --> 00:13:48,397
Hey, Wally, I think we swiped
the wrong style.

122
00:13:48,464 --> 00:13:51,433
- What?
- Those gals are khaki wacky!

123
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,900
- They're what?
- Look at that!

124
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:57,462
- Dames are falling for uniforms.
- I don't want dames!

125
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:59,701
All I want is to dance
with Betty tonight.

126
00:13:59,775 --> 00:14:02,801
Come on!
Let's get outta here!

127
00:14:02,878 --> 00:14:07,247
Everybody, down!
Everybody, down!

128
00:14:07,316 --> 00:14:10,444
This is your
diagonal warning!

129
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:13,340
Everybody, down!

130
00:14:24,918 --> 00:14:26,943
Oh, no.

131
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:52,770
Fill 'er up.
Ethyl.

132
00:14:55,282 --> 00:14:57,512
Where?

133
00:14:59,419 --> 00:15:02,650
It was just a case of war nerves.
Two squadrons of Japanese Zeroes-

134
00:15:02,722 --> 00:15:05,486
The Japs tried to bomb
San Francisco last night.

135
00:15:05,559 --> 00:15:10,019
Two squadrons of Jap Zeroes.
I've been trackin' them ever since.

136
00:15:10,096 --> 00:15:12,394
I lost them
somewhere over Fresno.

137
00:15:12,465 --> 00:15:15,400
Radio says that's not true
about San Francisco.

138
00:15:15,468 --> 00:15:18,266
- It was just a case of war nerves.
- War nerves?

139
00:15:18,338 --> 00:15:21,569
- Yeah.
- Who said, "war nerves"?

140
00:15:21,641 --> 00:15:24,906
I heard it
on that radio there.

141
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:30,107
- Radio's wrong.
- Oh, my God!

142
00:15:36,656 --> 00:15:38,886
Oh, shit!

143
00:15:41,328 --> 00:15:43,956
Oh!

144
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:46,521
Stop that plane!

145
00:15:48,635 --> 00:15:51,866
Stop! Stop!
Damn it! Stop!

146
00:15:59,646 --> 00:16:03,912
Madness. It's the only word
to describe it.

147
00:16:03,984 --> 00:16:07,249
This isn't the state of California.
This is a state of insanity.

148
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:10,084
General Stilwell,
Colonel Grant suggests dispatching...

149
00:16:10,156 --> 00:16:12,716
guard units to all
the city reservoirs.

150
00:16:12,792 --> 00:16:16,660
Intelligence suspects that
Fifth Columnists are going to...

151
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:19,824
"pour poison into
the water supply. "

152
00:16:19,899 --> 00:16:23,164
And G-2 should pour knockout
drops into the water supply.

153
00:16:23,236 --> 00:16:26,205
Maybe the people of the city would
calm down and leave the war to the Army.

154
00:16:33,613 --> 00:16:36,081
Stand off!

155
00:16:36,149 --> 00:16:39,277
Sir? Sir? The General.

156
00:16:39,352 --> 00:16:41,547
- My fingers. I need them over here.
- Do you hear sirens?

157
00:16:41,621 --> 00:16:44,317
- Captain Birkhead. General Stilwell is here.
- Do I hear sirens?

158
00:16:44,391 --> 00:16:46,882
Ow! Oh!
Sirens!

159
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:49,656
- What are you doin'? I'm not finished yet.
- Oh!

160
00:16:49,729 --> 00:16:54,723
- Sorry, Captain. Captain, what's your name again?
- Loomis Birkhead.

161
00:16:54,801 --> 00:16:58,328
- Sorry, Captain Birkhead, but that's General Stilwell.
- Wait!

162
00:16:58,405 --> 00:17:02,569
- I've got to get my story!
- I was just giving it to you.

163
00:17:04,844 --> 00:17:08,803
I'll tell ya, DuBois, there are
positive and negative aspects...

164
00:17:08,882 --> 00:17:11,908
about being a general's aide.

165
00:17:11,985 --> 00:17:14,419
The general couldn't have been
a couple more minutes late, could he?

166
00:17:14,487 --> 00:17:17,684
It is wartime, and we all
have to make sacrifices.

167
00:17:17,757 --> 00:17:20,954
Here he comes!

168
00:17:21,027 --> 00:17:23,552
- You have a telegram from Colonel Maddox, sir?
- Madman Maddox?

169
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:25,598
- What does he want?
- Troops, sir.

170
00:17:25,665 --> 00:17:28,725
Troops? It's a practice bombing range
in Barstow in the middle of the desert.

171
00:17:28,802 --> 00:17:31,532
What's he want troops for?
Give me that.

172
00:17:31,604 --> 00:17:34,402
"Request emergency troops.
Invasion imminent.

173
00:17:34,474 --> 00:17:39,207
Suspect hidden Jap airfield
in Pomona alfalfa fields. "

174
00:17:39,279 --> 00:17:42,214
I blame myself.
I put that lunatic out there.

175
00:17:42,349 --> 00:17:46,308
Jesus H. Christ, DuBois.
Is that the General's new secretary?

176
00:17:46,386 --> 00:17:48,547
Yes, sir.
She came in from G-2 this morning.

177
00:17:48,621 --> 00:17:53,320
- Not bad, huh?
- Not bad? She's a goddess. A goddamn goddess!

178
00:17:53,393 --> 00:17:56,851
That is Donna Stratton.
I knew her back in Washington.

179
00:17:56,930 --> 00:18:00,366
She has got this thing
for planes.

180
00:18:00,433 --> 00:18:03,493
One of those real
high-flyin' types, huh?

181
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:05,504
I've never seen
anything like it.

182
00:18:05,572 --> 00:18:07,597
She's got planes
on the brain.

183
00:18:07,674 --> 00:18:12,008
His brother had all those political
connections in Georgia. What could I do?

184
00:18:12,078 --> 00:18:14,808
Tell him to hold his position.
I'll send someone up there later.

185
00:18:14,881 --> 00:18:17,475
Where's Birkhead?
He's supposed to have my lunch.

186
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:21,111
B-17.

187
00:18:21,187 --> 00:18:24,020
Ooh.

188
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:28,493
No man has ever gotten to first
base with her on the ground.

189
00:18:28,561 --> 00:18:32,395
But get her into a plane, she'll bat
your balls right out of the park.

190
00:18:32,465 --> 00:18:35,127
- You can fly, sir?
- Who said anything about flying?

191
00:18:35,201 --> 00:18:39,604
I just gotta get her into that plane.
I'll fake the rest.

192
00:18:58,425 --> 00:19:00,484
Hello, Donna.

193
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:03,791
Donna Stratton, after all this time.
How long has it been?

194
00:19:03,863 --> 00:19:06,058
Not long enough.

195
00:19:06,132 --> 00:19:08,123
You're not still sore,
are you, Donna?

196
00:19:08,201 --> 00:19:10,897
Yes! In
a number of places.

197
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:13,302
Same old Donna.

198
00:19:13,373 --> 00:19:15,341
Listen, I got a great idea.

199
00:19:15,408 --> 00:19:18,241
Why don't we get together for dinner
tonight? We got a lot to talk about.

200
00:19:22,649 --> 00:19:27,677
What could you and I
possibly have to talk about?

201
00:19:27,754 --> 00:19:29,949
Airplanes.

202
00:19:30,023 --> 00:19:33,550
I seem to recall that you always
had a very keen interest in aircraft.

203
00:19:33,626 --> 00:19:35,560
Now, take this B-17,
for example.

204
00:19:35,628 --> 00:19:40,065
A woman like you is bound
to appreciate a plane like the 17.

205
00:19:40,133 --> 00:19:44,263
After all, it's big.
It's the biggest one here.

206
00:19:44,337 --> 00:19:47,238
You know what else?
It's got a lot of range.

207
00:19:47,307 --> 00:19:49,468
- You know what I mean by range, don't you?
- Oh, sure.

208
00:19:49,542 --> 00:19:54,411
It can stay up for a long time.
A very long time.

209
00:19:54,481 --> 00:19:57,075
It's built firm
and solid.

210
00:19:57,150 --> 00:20:02,645
It has to be, because of its
tremendous forward thrust.

211
00:20:02,722 --> 00:20:07,159
And when this baby
delivers its payload,

212
00:20:07,227 --> 00:20:09,195
devastating.

213
00:20:12,365 --> 00:20:16,631
- Oh, Captain. Let's get something straight.
- Please do.

214
00:20:16,703 --> 00:20:19,604
I don't like you.
I don't like the way you act.

215
00:20:19,672 --> 00:20:23,733
I especially don't like
your immature sexual innuendoes.

216
00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:25,801
- I was just kidding.
- The B-17 happens to be...

217
00:20:25,879 --> 00:20:28,575
- the most valuable strategic air bomber...
- Damn it!

218
00:20:28,648 --> 00:20:32,243
- When I went to flight school, we were taught to secure these.
- in the United States Air Corps.

219
00:20:32,318 --> 00:20:35,185
I didn't know you
went to flight school.

220
00:20:35,255 --> 00:20:38,088
I only logged in a couple of hours
in a little Beechcraft Trainer...

221
00:20:38,157 --> 00:20:41,183
before I got kicked out-
upstairs to become the General's aide.

222
00:20:41,261 --> 00:20:44,628
- But can you fly the B-17?
- B-17?

223
00:20:44,697 --> 00:20:46,961
- Can you fly the B-25?
- A plane's a plane.

224
00:20:47,033 --> 00:20:49,058
- Can you fly the 24 Liberator?
- Propeller and four wings.

225
00:20:49,135 --> 00:20:51,103
Can you fly
the 38 Lightning?

226
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:53,263
You can fly one,
you can fly them all.

227
00:20:53,339 --> 00:20:55,364
Sure, I could fly the 17.

228
00:20:55,441 --> 00:20:59,878
I'm sorry, Captain. I didn't realize you
had a serious interest in strategic bombers.

229
00:20:59,946 --> 00:21:02,676
Donna, my interest
is very strategic.

230
00:21:02,749 --> 00:21:07,119
How would you like me
to show you the cockpit?

231
00:21:07,252 --> 00:21:12,053
First let me say the possibility of
the Japs bombing us is, at best, remote.

232
00:21:12,124 --> 00:21:16,083
However, we're installing
antiaircraft batteries all over town.

233
00:21:16,161 --> 00:21:20,120
In addition, we have a vast network of
civil defense volunteer aircraft spotters...

234
00:21:20,198 --> 00:21:22,132
keeping a constant vigil.

235
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:27,035
They report their sightings directly
to Interceptor Command Headquarters.

236
00:21:27,105 --> 00:21:30,040
In the event of a sighting that cannot
be immediately identified by Headquarters,

237
00:21:30,108 --> 00:21:33,441
we go to a condition yellow
as a precaution.

238
00:21:33,512 --> 00:21:37,608
The aircraft maintains its position
and attempts to identify it fail,

239
00:21:37,683 --> 00:21:39,878
we go to a condition blue.

240
00:21:39,952 --> 00:21:45,322
The situation persists, we cannot establish
radio contact, we go to a red alert.

241
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:49,053
During a red alert,
air raid sirens will sound.

242
00:21:49,127 --> 00:21:53,962
All lights must be turned out. Searchlights
will scan the skies for enemy aircraft.

243
00:21:54,032 --> 00:21:56,125
Gun crews will be at ready.

244
00:21:56,201 --> 00:21:58,135
I hope.

245
00:21:58,203 --> 00:22:00,569
Clear the props!

246
00:22:00,639 --> 00:22:05,076
Boost pump on.
Energize. Engage. Ignition!

247
00:22:05,143 --> 00:22:08,476
Are we cleared for takeoff?

248
00:22:08,547 --> 00:22:11,015
B-17, two, seven, one.

249
00:22:11,083 --> 00:22:13,950
Cleared for takeoff
on runway one-eight.

250
00:22:14,019 --> 00:22:15,953
Winds from the southwest.

251
00:22:16,021 --> 00:22:19,013
- You want the stick?
- Yes, yes, yes. Give it to me.

252
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:25,161
All right. Now.

253
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:28,688
We are rolling.

254
00:22:28,767 --> 00:22:31,793
We're rolling
down that runway...

255
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:34,896
faster and faster.

256
00:22:34,973 --> 00:22:37,567
- I don't feel any thrust.
- Don't worry. You will!

257
00:22:37,642 --> 00:22:40,475
You will.
All right, all right.

258
00:22:40,545 --> 00:22:43,105
Max power!
We're past the point of rejection.

259
00:22:43,181 --> 00:22:46,673
- Get your nose up!
Pull back on that stick!

260
00:22:48,487 --> 00:22:51,115
Oh, very good.

261
00:22:51,189 --> 00:22:53,521
Landing gear up.

262
00:22:53,592 --> 00:22:57,926
And now we're leveling off
at 20,000 feet.

263
00:22:57,996 --> 00:22:59,793
Turn the wheel to the right.

264
00:23:02,667 --> 00:23:05,693
Good. We're at 20,000 feet.

265
00:23:06,772 --> 00:23:09,206
Ow!

266
00:23:09,274 --> 00:23:11,401
- What's that?
- Nothing. It was a little turbulence.

267
00:23:11,476 --> 00:23:13,774
We hit an air pocket.
Nothing to worry about.

268
00:23:13,845 --> 00:23:16,370
Objectives in sight.

269
00:23:16,448 --> 00:23:18,882
We peer down
the bomb sight.

270
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:21,145
We're on target.

271
00:23:21,219 --> 00:23:24,916
We open
the bomb bay doors.

272
00:23:30,896 --> 00:23:34,423
We are getting
closer and closer.

273
00:23:34,499 --> 00:23:37,935
We are
approaching target.

274
00:23:38,003 --> 00:23:42,667
You're almost there.
Here we go, Donna. Here we go.

275
00:23:42,741 --> 00:23:45,642
Bombs away.

276
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:48,679
Who's playing in
the cockpit? Goddamn it!

277
00:23:48,747 --> 00:23:51,272
- Mission scrubbed.
- Oh, Donna!

278
00:23:51,349 --> 00:23:54,147
Sorry to have to bail out, Loomis,
but it just won't work on the ground.

279
00:23:54,219 --> 00:23:56,779
I tried it in the simulator once.
It was no good there either.

280
00:23:56,855 --> 00:23:58,823
We've got to be airborne.

281
00:23:58,890 --> 00:24:01,290
But, Donna, listen.
We'll try a different flight plan.

282
00:24:01,359 --> 00:24:04,487
We are divebombing Tokyo.

283
00:24:04,563 --> 00:24:08,158
I'd like to say
one final word about bombs.

284
00:24:08,233 --> 00:24:11,168
The eventuality of an air raid
on this city is highly unlikely.

285
00:24:11,236 --> 00:24:15,434
Oh, Donna. You can't do this to me. You
don't know what I've been through today.

286
00:24:15,507 --> 00:24:18,374
Loomis, my father was a drill
sergeant in the Marine Corps.

287
00:24:18,443 --> 00:24:22,504
He taught me how to defend
myself. Now, leave me alone.

288
00:24:22,581 --> 00:24:25,607
Donna, please-

289
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:31,487
As long as I am here,
I can assure you,

290
00:24:31,556 --> 00:24:34,320
there will be no bombs
dropped here.

291
00:24:47,939 --> 00:24:53,293
We think we've located
Captain Birkhead, sir.

292
00:25:03,436 --> 00:25:07,463
Okay, okay.

293
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:10,031
Bye! See you later!

294
00:25:11,244 --> 00:25:13,872
Bye-bye!

295
00:25:13,947 --> 00:25:16,780
Maxine, I don't know why
I ever listen to you.

296
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:20,581
I can't do this to Wally. You know
he's been waiting a long time for this.

297
00:25:20,653 --> 00:25:23,645
- He's even learning how to dance.
- Forget about Wally.

298
00:25:23,723 --> 00:25:26,283
Think of all those soldiers and sailors
we'll be dancing with tonight.

299
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:29,760
I can't forget about Wally.

300
00:25:29,829 --> 00:25:33,026
What are you gonna do? Turn your back
on those brave men in uniform...

301
00:25:33,099 --> 00:25:35,124
so you can dance
with some criminal?

302
00:25:35,201 --> 00:25:38,864
Wally is not a criminal.
He's just- He's just original-

303
00:25:38,938 --> 00:25:41,998
- He stole your father's car.
That's really original.

304
00:25:42,075 --> 00:25:46,102
- Wally? What are you doing here?
- Betty?

305
00:25:46,179 --> 00:25:49,171
Oh, my God. If my father
catches you here, he'll kill you.

306
00:25:49,249 --> 00:25:54,050
I paid my debt to society. Your father
has a brand-new auto, a new garage.

307
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,054
Did the fire insurance
pay for all this?

308
00:25:56,122 --> 00:25:59,683
My dad it can't possibly cover what he's
gonna do to you if he sees you again.

309
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:04,287
I had to show you the new set of drapes
I picked up for the dance this evening.

310
00:26:04,364 --> 00:26:09,666
Look at this. A wreath pleat, a stuffed
cuff and a wreath sleeve. Snazzy, huh?

311
00:26:09,736 --> 00:26:13,832
- Watch these new steps!
- I have to talk to you.

312
00:26:13,907 --> 00:26:17,434
- Would you listen?
- You can forget about the dance tonight.

313
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:20,138
They won't let you near
the place dressed like that.

314
00:26:20,213 --> 00:26:22,977
It's a USO club now
for servicemen only.

315
00:26:23,049 --> 00:26:26,576
- And we're hostesses.
- What do you mean, "hostesses"?

316
00:26:26,653 --> 00:26:29,918
- That like a waitress?
- It means we can only dance with servicemen.

317
00:26:29,989 --> 00:26:32,219
- Real men.
- What do you mean?

318
00:26:32,292 --> 00:26:35,693
You joined some organization that tells
you who you can and can't dance with?

319
00:26:35,762 --> 00:26:40,131
You're talking
about the USO!

320
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,794
Where does that
leave us, Betty?

321
00:26:42,869 --> 00:26:46,305
Look, I know you don't
owe me anything.

322
00:26:46,372 --> 00:26:50,570
But I've been lookin' forward to this
night for a long, long time.

323
00:26:50,643 --> 00:26:53,237
- What am I supposed to do?
- Get a uniform.

324
00:26:53,313 --> 00:26:55,247
This is my uniform!

325
00:26:55,315 --> 00:26:58,978
I'm an American too, and there's
a lot of things I have to do.

326
00:26:59,052 --> 00:27:01,782
I have to do my part, Wally.

327
00:27:01,854 --> 00:27:04,084
There's a lot of lonely
servicemen out there.

328
00:27:04,157 --> 00:27:08,423
- I don't want to see them
stuck on some German- - Bayonet.

329
00:27:08,494 --> 00:27:11,691
Do you wanna go with me
tonight? Yes or no?

330
00:27:11,764 --> 00:27:13,356
- Yes.
- Betty.

331
00:27:13,433 --> 00:27:15,367
Think about those guys.

332
00:27:15,435 --> 00:27:18,233
I mean, no.
I mean, yes.

333
00:27:18,304 --> 00:27:20,602
The hairy chests
and the hairy arms-

334
00:27:20,673 --> 00:27:23,141
I don't know!
I don't know!

335
00:27:23,209 --> 00:27:26,474
You're gettin' me confused.

336
00:27:26,546 --> 00:27:28,605
I'm just confused.

337
00:27:28,681 --> 00:27:30,615
Oh, okay. Okay.

338
00:27:30,683 --> 00:27:32,617
Wait. Look.

339
00:27:32,685 --> 00:27:35,279
I'll meet ya in front
of the dance hall at 8:00.

340
00:27:35,355 --> 00:27:38,916
If they won't let me in,
we can go see a movie.

341
00:27:38,992 --> 00:27:43,554
Okay? There's that new
Walt Disney cartoon playin' around.

342
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:44,961
Dumbo!

343
00:27:46,699 --> 00:27:50,567
Oh, my God.
Here comes my father.

344
00:27:52,972 --> 00:27:54,906
And he's got a gun!

345
00:27:54,974 --> 00:27:57,738
Quick, Wally. Go out the garage door.

346
00:27:57,810 --> 00:27:59,744
I'll stall him.

347
00:28:01,514 --> 00:28:05,678
Come on! Oh! Hello? Come on!

348
00:28:05,752 --> 00:28:07,777
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi. How are you?

349
00:28:07,854 --> 00:28:09,788
- Dad, I'd like you to meet my friend.
- Hi!

350
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:10,982
It won't open!

351
00:28:11,057 --> 00:28:13,685
Dad, Dad,
I joined the USO.

352
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,422
Yes, I know. You told me, dear.
We all got to do what we can.

353
00:28:27,073 --> 00:28:29,769
Aha!

354
00:28:38,184 --> 00:28:41,517
Shit. I didn't hear any gunshots.
He must have got away.

355
00:28:41,587 --> 00:28:43,851
What's that rug-
That's my hat!

356
00:28:43,923 --> 00:28:46,016
Gus, Gus, wait
'til they step on it.

357
00:28:46,092 --> 00:28:48,026
That's my brand-new hat.

358
00:28:54,734 --> 00:28:56,224
Surrender!

359
00:28:56,302 --> 00:29:00,295
- Macey Douglas, what is the meaning of this?
- What is this?

360
00:29:00,373 --> 00:29:03,706
Jap trap. We're gonna cover it
over with sticks and stuff.

361
00:29:03,776 --> 00:29:06,301
Dad says when the Japs
sneak up, they'll fall in.

362
00:29:06,379 --> 00:29:09,542
I'm going to kill you.

363
00:29:09,615 --> 00:29:12,106
Wait 'til I get out of here,
I'm gonna murder you!

364
00:29:12,185 --> 00:29:15,097
You dug your own grave.

365
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:27,408
Ward Douglas.

366
00:29:27,476 --> 00:29:31,845
Wow! Look what we're getting.

367
00:29:31,913 --> 00:29:35,542
I will not have guns
in this house.

368
00:29:36,652 --> 00:29:40,952
Uh, excuse us, ma'am.

369
00:29:41,023 --> 00:29:44,754
Heads up!

370
00:29:44,826 --> 00:29:47,659
Hello?

371
00:29:47,729 --> 00:29:50,163
Sorry, ma'am. Our gun
kind of got away on us there.

372
00:29:50,232 --> 00:29:52,962
- All right, move it back! Come on!
- Shit! Oh, sorry.

373
00:29:53,035 --> 00:29:55,299
Come on, move it out!
Back it up, ya foul-ups.

374
00:29:55,370 --> 00:29:58,339
Let's go, Reese.
Move it out easy now.

375
00:29:58,407 --> 00:30:00,375
Come on, Foley.
Get in here and push.

376
00:30:00,442 --> 00:30:04,902
- Gee whiz.
- Corporal Sitarski, get on that wheel. Come on!

377
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:06,914
All right.
Sitarski, lock it up!

378
00:30:07,983 --> 00:30:10,747
- Ow!
- Watch yourself.

379
00:30:10,819 --> 00:30:13,720
Attention, Foley,
Sitarski, Reese, let's go!

380
00:30:13,789 --> 00:30:15,757
Fall in on the double.
Hustle, hustle!

381
00:30:15,824 --> 00:30:18,918
Oh, my God!
My roses!

382
00:30:18,994 --> 00:30:22,088
Ten-hut! At ease.

383
00:30:22,164 --> 00:30:25,156
Sir, Sergeant Frank Tree, United States
Army Tenth Armored Division.

384
00:30:25,233 --> 00:30:28,396
Mr. Ward Herbert Douglas,
1313 Pelican Way?

385
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:30,938
Yes.

386
00:30:31,006 --> 00:30:35,943
Uh-huh. The Coast Artillery Command
has determined your property...

387
00:30:36,011 --> 00:30:39,742
to be strategically advantageous
for the installation...

388
00:30:39,815 --> 00:30:42,249
of an enemy aircraft
defense battery.

389
00:30:42,317 --> 00:30:45,013
What?

390
00:30:45,087 --> 00:30:50,184
We want to put this 40 millimeter
antiaircraft gun in your yard, sir.

391
00:30:51,626 --> 00:30:54,925
Joan, they want to put
this gun in our yard.

392
00:30:54,996 --> 00:30:58,056
No. Absolutely not.
I refuse to let you...

393
00:30:58,133 --> 00:31:00,693
bring the war into
my own front yard.

394
00:31:00,769 --> 00:31:03,203
Joan. Joan dearest. Uh-

395
00:31:03,271 --> 00:31:06,536
That's the point, isn't it?
Whose front yard is this?

396
00:31:06,608 --> 00:31:11,272
Is it Tojo's front yard? Is it Hirohito's
front yard? No. It's my front yard.

397
00:31:11,346 --> 00:31:15,214
It was bought and paid for
in the free marketplace.

398
00:31:15,283 --> 00:31:17,308
I am going to defend it.

399
00:31:17,386 --> 00:31:20,947
Then join the Civilian Defense.
You could become a block warden.

400
00:31:21,022 --> 00:31:25,516
I'm not going to run around like Angelo
Scioli with a whistle and flashlight,

401
00:31:25,594 --> 00:31:27,528
hollering, "Lights out. "

402
00:31:30,098 --> 00:31:33,431
Calma! After the war,
I'll turn it back to a car.

403
00:31:33,502 --> 00:31:37,063
- Right now it's a tank for the Civil Defense.
- Angelo.

404
00:31:39,141 --> 00:31:42,304
You promised me a lawn chair
on the beach...

405
00:31:42,377 --> 00:31:44,811
in front of Ward's house
with binoculars.

406
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:48,748
That was originally. You still got
a chair. You still got binoculars.

407
00:31:48,817 --> 00:31:53,049
Only now you're on top of
the ferris wheel in the amusement park.

408
00:31:53,121 --> 00:31:55,055
You don't understand.

409
00:31:55,123 --> 00:31:58,524
I've got a little problem.

410
00:31:58,593 --> 00:32:01,153
I'm afraid of heights.
Yeah, yeah.

411
00:32:01,229 --> 00:32:03,857
Can't look down
from high up.

412
00:32:03,932 --> 00:32:06,025
What do you call that?
Hydrophobia?

413
00:32:06,101 --> 00:32:09,298
- Acrophobia.
- No problem. Won't bother ya.

414
00:32:09,371 --> 00:32:12,397
You never look down.
You just look up.

415
00:32:12,474 --> 00:32:16,001
You sit on top of the ferris wheel
with your binoculars spotting aircraft.

416
00:32:16,077 --> 00:32:19,877
- You never look down. Up, up, up-
- Who's with me?

417
00:32:19,948 --> 00:32:23,111
- Oh, I got a wonderful guy. Very simpatico.
- Good man?

418
00:32:23,185 --> 00:32:26,177
Calm, cool,
collected, balanced.

419
00:32:26,254 --> 00:32:28,586
- He knows all about heights?
An expert?

420
00:32:28,657 --> 00:32:31,558
This person is an expert
about everything.

421
00:32:31,626 --> 00:32:33,753
Calma.

422
00:32:33,829 --> 00:32:37,094
That's not defense, Joan.
This is defense.

423
00:32:37,165 --> 00:32:41,124
- Ward, I have to talk-
- Sir, ma'am, please. Let's not fight.

424
00:32:41,203 --> 00:32:44,969
If there's one thing I can't stand, it's
seeing Americans fighting Americans.

425
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:50,478
If you let them keep that gun
in our yard, our home will be a target.

426
00:32:50,545 --> 00:32:53,776
Joan, we're all targets
in this war.

427
00:32:53,849 --> 00:32:56,283
At least we will
be able to shoot back.

428
00:32:56,351 --> 00:32:59,184
- How do I work this thing, Sergeant?
- You shouldn't touch it.

429
00:32:59,254 --> 00:33:02,246
There will be a gunnery crew here
on Monday to man the ordnance.

430
00:33:02,324 --> 00:33:05,521
- Monday?
- Yes, sir.

431
00:33:05,594 --> 00:33:08,324
- Where will they go to the bathroom?
- Oh.

432
00:33:08,396 --> 00:33:11,991
Remember I saw him first.
He's mine.

433
00:33:12,067 --> 00:33:14,535
I will not allow you
to bring the war into my front yard.

434
00:33:14,603 --> 00:33:17,504
Hello, hello, hello.

435
00:33:17,572 --> 00:33:20,735
Sitarski! Quit goldbrickin'!
Go in that garage,

436
00:33:20,809 --> 00:33:23,039
find a cement block and
stabilize that ordnance.

437
00:33:23,111 --> 00:33:25,045
- Move it!
- Yes, sir!

438
00:33:25,113 --> 00:33:29,982
- You heard your boss. Put me down.
- Anything you say, doll.

439
00:33:32,587 --> 00:33:36,114
- Come on, get the lead out! Move, move, move!
- Yes, sir!

440
00:33:36,191 --> 00:33:39,649
Sergeant, there's no way this gun
can go off by itself, is there?

441
00:33:39,728 --> 00:33:42,288
Actually, I'm a motor pool
maintenance sergeant.

442
00:33:42,364 --> 00:33:44,298
I don't know too much
about the gunnery stuff.

443
00:33:44,366 --> 00:33:47,199
However, I can tell you this material
is a 40 millimeter automatic gun...

444
00:33:47,269 --> 00:33:49,237
effective against
low-flying aerial targets.

445
00:33:49,304 --> 00:33:51,602
The gun will displace a 1.96 pound,
high-explosive armor-

446
00:33:51,673 --> 00:33:54,073
Count to ten.

447
00:33:54,142 --> 00:33:58,772
One, two-

448
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:07,980
How can we make sure that
the gun doesn't go off?

449
00:34:08,056 --> 00:34:11,287
The upper part of the gun
carriage is capable of...

450
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:14,954
a full 360 degree traverse with a
maximum barrel elevation of 90 degrees.

451
00:34:18,099 --> 00:34:20,932
This is a cement block.

452
00:34:26,908 --> 00:34:29,376
Projectile at 2,960 feet per second-

453
00:34:33,181 --> 00:34:36,776
- Don't they teach you manners in the Army?
- You're right. I'm sorry.

454
00:34:36,851 --> 00:34:41,185
I'm Corporal Chuck Sitarski,
United States Army.

455
00:34:42,757 --> 00:34:47,694
But, uh, my good friends
call me Stretch.

456
00:34:47,762 --> 00:34:52,062
How are ya? Aw, look,
I'm sorry I dropped you in that hole.

457
00:34:52,133 --> 00:34:54,567
Listen, you got a
little thing in your hair-

458
00:34:54,636 --> 00:34:57,537
I'll tell you what.
If it makes you feel any better,

459
00:34:57,606 --> 00:34:59,574
why don't you haul off
and slug me?

460
00:34:59,641 --> 00:35:03,975
- Plant one right here on my kisser.
- I don't want to hit you.

461
00:35:04,045 --> 00:35:08,414
- Make a fist.
- All right.

462
00:35:08,483 --> 00:35:10,417
You shouldn't touch
the ordnance at all.

463
00:35:10,485 --> 00:35:13,977
But more specifically, you should
never pull this hand-operating lever...

464
00:35:14,055 --> 00:35:15,989
- to the rear.
- Never.

465
00:35:16,057 --> 00:35:19,390
Do not push a clip of ammunition
down into the feed rollers here.

466
00:35:19,461 --> 00:35:21,486
- You would never put the ammunition-
- No, sir. Never.

467
00:35:21,563 --> 00:35:23,497
You never restore
this lever to firing position.

468
00:35:23,565 --> 00:35:26,033
Do not make sure that this cover
is completely closed.

469
00:35:26,101 --> 00:35:28,968
Never depress operator's
foot triggers here, here...

470
00:35:29,037 --> 00:35:30,971
- and at the rear here.
- Never.

471
00:35:31,039 --> 00:35:33,872
If an ordinary Joe
like me...

472
00:35:33,942 --> 00:35:37,309
went to one of those
fancy USO dances,

473
00:35:37,379 --> 00:35:40,871
and he saw an awful pretty
girl like you, and-

474
00:35:40,949 --> 00:35:43,008
And he wanted to ask her
to dance,

475
00:35:43,084 --> 00:35:45,882
- you think maybe she'd, uh, say, uh-
- Yes?

476
00:35:45,954 --> 00:35:48,889
Yeah.

477
00:35:50,258 --> 00:35:51,623
Don't listen
to that jerk!

478
00:35:51,693 --> 00:35:53,126
You!

479
00:35:53,194 --> 00:35:56,357
You!

480
00:35:56,431 --> 00:35:58,524
- You!
- You.

481
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:03,537
You... have a really
serious wardrobe problem, kid.

482
00:36:03,605 --> 00:36:07,735
It's isn't fair!
No! No!

483
00:36:09,911 --> 00:36:13,972
Put me down! No! No!
No, no, no, no, no!

484
00:36:14,049 --> 00:36:18,213
I'm gonna be there at 8:00 in front of
the Crystal Ballroom. I'll meet you there!

485
00:36:18,286 --> 00:36:20,846
- No, you won't!
- Yes, I will!

486
00:36:20,922 --> 00:36:24,483
- No, you won't!
- Yes, I will!

487
00:36:24,559 --> 00:36:28,263
No, you won't.

488
00:38:10,999 --> 00:38:14,457
Holly... wood-

489
00:38:25,046 --> 00:38:27,480
Hollywood.

490
00:38:27,549 --> 00:38:30,017
Hollywood-

491
00:38:30,084 --> 00:38:33,110
Tsk.

492
00:38:33,188 --> 00:38:37,056
Pinewood.

493
00:38:37,125 --> 00:38:39,992
Cheese!

494
00:38:40,061 --> 00:38:43,895
- Cheese!
- Okay.

495
00:38:43,965 --> 00:38:46,490
# Bring on your tough hoss #

496
00:38:46,568 --> 00:38:49,036
# You never had one #

497
00:38:49,103 --> 00:38:52,595
# That would set me
to guessin' or- #

498
00:38:54,175 --> 00:38:56,837
# Bother me none #

499
00:38:58,279 --> 00:39:02,909
# You've got that right
That's one thing I can do #

500
00:39:04,986 --> 00:39:08,786
# Says I got one
That's a bad one to bust #

501
00:39:08,856 --> 00:39:12,257
# He's been throwin' good riders
He's- # Whoa!

502
00:39:12,327 --> 00:39:15,023
Hey!

503
00:39:45,193 --> 00:39:50,688
Well, it's kind of skinny
around the bottom, but what the heck.

504
00:39:56,704 --> 00:39:59,229
Well, I'll be doggoned.

505
00:39:59,307 --> 00:40:02,140
Where'd you little bastards
come from?

506
00:40:02,210 --> 00:40:06,670
Thought you could hide
from old Holly, didn't ya?

507
00:40:06,748 --> 00:40:08,875
Doggone it.

508
00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:11,214
You get smaller every year.

509
00:40:12,287 --> 00:40:15,381
Oh, shoot!
Fire, fire, fire!

510
00:40:19,027 --> 00:40:21,427
Now, that's a nice one
right there.

511
00:40:21,496 --> 00:40:23,691
Yes, sir, that one there.

512
00:40:30,571 --> 00:40:34,701
I'm gonna have to
try that again.

513
00:40:40,581 --> 00:40:44,950
Whoa! Jesus palomino!
Walkin' trees!

514
00:40:53,628 --> 00:40:56,256
Holly... wood.

515
00:40:56,331 --> 00:41:00,495
Hollywood.
Hollywood!

516
00:41:00,568 --> 00:41:02,968
Banzai! Banzai!

517
00:41:20,922 --> 00:41:24,323
Uh-huh. I'm lost.

518
00:41:32,033 --> 00:41:35,230
Uh-oh. Uh-oh.

519
00:41:35,303 --> 00:41:36,964
Oooh!

520
00:41:48,716 --> 00:41:52,208
Huh?

521
00:41:52,286 --> 00:41:55,153
Huh?

522
00:41:59,327 --> 00:42:02,023
Oh.

523
00:42:02,096 --> 00:42:04,121
Ah.

524
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:08,426
# The stars at night
are big and bright #

525
00:42:10,505 --> 00:42:12,439
# Deep in
the heart of Texas #

526
00:42:15,610 --> 00:42:17,578
Starved.

527
00:42:17,645 --> 00:42:19,579
Can opener!

528
00:42:30,925 --> 00:42:34,452
Ha-ha! Ho-ho!
Ha-ha!

529
00:42:35,563 --> 00:42:37,656
Does that gun work?

530
00:42:37,732 --> 00:42:39,666
You ain't gonna shoot nobody,
are ya?

531
00:42:39,734 --> 00:42:42,862
You ought to get some oil on that thing.
You shouldn't leave it settin' out.

532
00:42:42,937 --> 00:42:45,872
- Down there?
What is it? A Winchester?

533
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:47,908
That's what I got,
a Winchester.

534
00:42:47,975 --> 00:42:50,637
Lever action,
shoots like a house on fire.

535
00:42:50,711 --> 00:42:54,613
You ought to try to pick one up-
Don't go stepping on me.

536
00:42:54,682 --> 00:42:57,549
Ought to try to pick one up
while you're over here.

537
00:42:57,618 --> 00:42:59,882
Damn good gun.

538
00:43:01,889 --> 00:43:03,823
Ah!

539
00:43:14,168 --> 00:43:18,036
You sneaky little bastards ain't
gettin' doodily shit outta me,

540
00:43:18,105 --> 00:43:22,132
except maybe my name, rank
and social security number.

541
00:43:22,210 --> 00:43:26,112
Wood, Hollis P.
Lumberjack.

542
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:30,207
Social security: 1-0-6...

543
00:43:30,284 --> 00:43:33,720
4-3... 2-1-8-5.

544
00:43:37,825 --> 00:43:39,759
Where Hollywood?

545
00:43:39,827 --> 00:43:42,455
- Right here.
- What?

546
00:43:42,530 --> 00:43:44,998
You're lookin' at him.

547
00:43:45,066 --> 00:43:47,728
- Who?
- Hollis Wood.

548
00:43:47,802 --> 00:43:50,134
Where?

549
00:43:50,204 --> 00:43:54,163
I'm right here. Shoot.
Can't ya understand plain English?

550
00:43:54,242 --> 00:43:57,075
- Hollywood?
- Huh?

551
00:43:57,144 --> 00:43:59,271
- Where?
- Here!

552
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:06,379
Look. Where Hollywood?

553
00:44:06,454 --> 00:44:08,615
North? South?

554
00:44:08,689 --> 00:44:13,558
Oh. You want me to tell you
where Hollywood is.

555
00:44:13,628 --> 00:44:16,290
Well, shoot. That's easy.
Hollywood is right-

556
00:44:22,937 --> 00:44:24,905
Oh, no, you don't.

557
00:44:24,972 --> 00:44:30,171
You thought you was gonna get me to show
you where Hollywood was, didn't ya?

558
00:44:30,244 --> 00:44:34,772
Tried to sneak up on me
like ya did Pearl Harbor!

559
00:44:34,849 --> 00:44:37,443
Bet you're gonna bomb
John Wayne's house, ain't ya?

560
00:44:37,518 --> 00:44:40,112
- John Wayne-o?
- I knew it!

561
00:44:40,187 --> 00:44:44,419
I knew it. I ain't gonna tell ya
one stinkin' thing.

562
00:44:44,492 --> 00:44:46,960
You can torture me,
do anything you want to.

563
00:44:47,028 --> 00:44:50,725
Jesus palomino.

564
00:44:50,798 --> 00:44:53,767
A Nazi!
I knew it!

565
00:44:53,834 --> 00:44:56,166
You're all in cahoots!

566
00:44:56,237 --> 00:45:00,640
Let me tell you something,
Mr. Heinie Kraut,

567
00:45:00,708 --> 00:45:03,199
I fought your kind
in the great war.

568
00:45:03,277 --> 00:45:06,838
And we kicked
the livin' shit outta ya.

569
00:45:06,914 --> 00:45:09,940
# Over there, over there #

570
00:45:10,017 --> 00:45:12,508
# Send the word
Send the word over there #

571
00:45:12,587 --> 00:45:17,320
- # That the Yanks are comin'
The Huns are runnin' ##

572
00:45:20,261 --> 00:45:24,220
Hey! What do ya go
tearin' up my radio for?

573
00:45:24,298 --> 00:45:26,926
What's the big idea?

574
00:45:29,099 --> 00:45:32,330
All right. Go ahead
and search me if you want to.

575
00:45:35,572 --> 00:45:40,236
One genuine American
jackrabbit foot.

576
00:45:43,714 --> 00:45:48,242
One authentic early American
hari-kari knife.

577
00:45:48,318 --> 00:45:53,221
Pass it around, boys. Maybe
somebody's got a use for it.

578
00:45:53,290 --> 00:45:57,021
One ten-cent box
of delicious,

579
00:45:57,094 --> 00:46:01,224
nutritious,
caramel-coated Popperjacks.

580
00:46:03,767 --> 00:46:06,361
Doggone it,
this is my stuff.

581
00:46:18,248 --> 00:46:21,775
Compass.

582
00:46:38,135 --> 00:46:41,730
Banzai, my balls-

583
00:46:49,546 --> 00:46:53,175
Let's see you try and find
Hollywood now, you scrawny little-

584
00:46:53,250 --> 00:46:56,481
Hey, boy, watch that knife.

585
00:47:10,567 --> 00:47:13,229
Prune juice.

586
00:47:13,303 --> 00:47:17,205
Oh, no, you don't! Aah!

587
00:47:34,291 --> 00:47:36,259
Oh, boy, rides!

588
00:47:36,326 --> 00:47:39,022
- It'll be okay. Don't worry.
- I don't know, Angelo.

589
00:47:39,096 --> 00:47:41,929
- What if my nose bleeds?
- Use a handkerchief.

590
00:47:41,999 --> 00:47:45,298
Oh, boy. Oh, boy.
Oh, boy. A ferris wheel.

591
00:47:45,369 --> 00:47:48,702
I love ferris wheels.
Do we get to ride this all night?

592
00:47:48,772 --> 00:47:50,706
Just to the end
of the shift.

593
00:47:50,774 --> 00:47:54,107
We don't have to pay for this, do we?
We're working for the government now.

594
00:47:54,177 --> 00:47:56,771
Don't worry, Herb.
You don't pay for nothin'.

595
00:47:56,847 --> 00:47:59,111
Is that where
you turn it on?

596
00:47:59,182 --> 00:48:02,549
I always wanted to work
one of these babies.

597
00:48:04,554 --> 00:48:07,387
"Warning: Do not...

598
00:48:07,457 --> 00:48:10,051
turn on switch. "

599
00:48:10,127 --> 00:48:12,061
Ow! Hey!

600
00:48:12,129 --> 00:48:16,259
Don't touch that.
These are the master control switches.

601
00:48:16,333 --> 00:48:20,133
You fool around with them,
you turn on the whole amusement park.

602
00:48:22,205 --> 00:48:26,767
- I love ferris wheels.
- Relax, Claude. Everything's gonna be all right.

603
00:48:26,843 --> 00:48:29,334
Here's what you gotta do.

604
00:48:29,413 --> 00:48:35,147
If you hear or see any airplanes,
you pick up the phone,

605
00:48:35,218 --> 00:48:38,710
you yell, "Army flash!"

606
00:48:38,789 --> 00:48:41,849
- You got a direct line to the Interceptor Command.
- Hey!

607
00:48:41,925 --> 00:48:45,918
Then you tell them exactly
what ya saw and where. Here.

608
00:48:45,996 --> 00:48:50,558
You know my problem with heights. I
don't want to be stuck up there with him.

609
00:48:50,634 --> 00:48:54,161
Jesus Christ, Angelo.
They gave him a gun.

610
00:48:54,237 --> 00:48:56,569
Don't worry. He got a license.
He's an expert shot.

611
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:59,336
Don't worry.
Try to adjust to him.

612
00:48:59,409 --> 00:49:02,037
- To know him is to love him.
- Ow!

613
00:49:02,112 --> 00:49:04,842
Don't worry.
You'll both be compatible.

614
00:49:04,915 --> 00:49:07,884
If not, I'll get you a replacement.
Just sit down, Claude.

615
00:49:07,951 --> 00:49:11,478
Remember, you're both
very vital to Civil Defense.

616
00:49:13,590 --> 00:49:16,252
Safety bar?
We don't need no safety bar.

617
00:49:16,326 --> 00:49:19,056
What happens
if we have to jump?

618
00:49:19,129 --> 00:49:21,859
You keep the safety bar
locked at all times.

619
00:49:21,932 --> 00:49:25,561
And remember, don't act up, Herbie,
like you did last summer.

620
00:49:25,635 --> 00:49:28,695
No standing up
and no rocking.

621
00:49:28,772 --> 00:49:32,208
You mean this thing
rocks? Whoa!

622
00:49:32,275 --> 00:49:35,073
Whoa! Whoa!

623
00:49:35,145 --> 00:49:37,375
Don't worry.
You're perfectly safe.

624
00:49:37,447 --> 00:49:40,416
Like a baby in its mother's arms.
You got nothin' to worry about.

625
00:49:40,484 --> 00:49:44,011
I once swung around in one of these
things 180 degrees and I didn't get hurt.

626
00:49:44,087 --> 00:49:47,056
No, sir, buddy. There's no way
you can get killed in one of these,

627
00:49:47,124 --> 00:49:49,251
unless you really try.

628
00:49:49,326 --> 00:49:51,886
Like this one guy I knew.
He committed suicide.

629
00:49:51,962 --> 00:49:54,192
He just stood up and did
a swan dive straight down.

630
00:49:54,264 --> 00:49:57,233
Sit down, please.
Just stay seated, please.

631
00:49:57,300 --> 00:50:00,030
Don't look down, Claude.
You'll be all right.

632
00:50:00,103 --> 00:50:05,234
Up, up, up. I'll be back to pick you up
after your shift. Ciao.

633
00:50:12,883 --> 00:50:14,976
Hey, this
grapefruit's rotten.

634
00:50:15,052 --> 00:50:18,146
I'm gonna throw it away.
Is it all right with you?

635
00:50:18,221 --> 00:50:20,155
All right, I'm gonna
throw it away.

636
00:50:20,223 --> 00:50:24,091
Here it goes.
It's going. It's going.

637
00:50:24,161 --> 00:50:26,220
It's going. It's going.

638
00:50:26,296 --> 00:50:29,595
Going. It's going.
It's going.

639
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:32,434
Too bad I forgot
to time it.

640
00:50:32,502 --> 00:50:35,062
If I'd timed it, I would have known
how long it took to hit the ground.

641
00:50:35,138 --> 00:50:37,732
Because objects fall
at 32 feet per second.

642
00:50:37,808 --> 00:50:40,368
Would you just shut up
about heights?

643
00:50:40,444 --> 00:50:43,504
I don't want to hear
another word about heights.

644
00:50:47,150 --> 00:50:50,483
- Boy, I sure hope the wind starts-
- Just shut up!

645
00:50:50,554 --> 00:50:54,752
Now don't say
another word.

646
00:51:07,504 --> 00:51:10,132
Scared of heights, huh?
Ha, ha, ha! Me too.

647
00:51:31,695 --> 00:51:34,562
You ain't gettin'
shit outta me.

648
00:51:34,631 --> 00:51:39,193
I've been constipated all week and
there ain't a damn thing you can do.

649
00:51:50,447 --> 00:51:52,506
Now wait a minute, General!

650
00:51:52,582 --> 00:51:55,517
I'm doin'
the best I can.

651
00:51:55,585 --> 00:51:59,749
You gotta tell these guys
that I gotta have more privacy.

652
00:51:59,823 --> 00:52:03,452
How in the hell do you expect a guy
to take a bowel movement...

653
00:52:03,527 --> 00:52:07,463
with a bunch of buffalo rifles
a- pointin' at 'im?

654
00:52:07,531 --> 00:52:11,092
I have enough problems
just pissin' in a public restroom.

655
00:52:53,777 --> 00:52:56,712
Hmph!

656
00:53:16,466 --> 00:53:20,562
Ahh!

657
00:53:24,608 --> 00:53:29,136
Huh?

658
00:53:34,918 --> 00:53:38,354
All right, you!

659
00:53:53,770 --> 00:53:56,034
Get outta my way!

660
00:53:56,106 --> 00:53:58,631
God bless America!

661
00:53:58,708 --> 00:54:00,676
Hey!

662
00:54:00,744 --> 00:54:04,703
Let go of my foot,
you son of a bitch you!

663
00:54:15,525 --> 00:54:19,325
Which way's the damn beach?
Oh, shit!

664
00:54:36,869 --> 00:54:40,066
Detail, assume defense positions
on the double!

665
00:54:40,139 --> 00:54:43,700
- All right, move!
Clear all civilians outta here!

666
00:54:46,145 --> 00:54:48,170
No civilians tonight.
Get 'em back.

667
00:54:48,247 --> 00:54:51,512
Get 'em out there.
Keep 'em back.

668
00:54:55,187 --> 00:54:58,020
Ah. Dumbo.

669
00:54:58,090 --> 00:55:01,025
Sure be good to get my mind
off things for a while.

670
00:55:11,270 --> 00:55:14,205
Come on, I don't
want to miss Dumbo.

671
00:55:14,273 --> 00:55:17,709
General Stilwell, sir,
an urgent message from Barstow!

672
00:55:17,776 --> 00:55:21,371
- From Colonel Maddox, son?
- Sir, they're worried about an invasion.

673
00:55:21,447 --> 00:55:25,884
Christ, I thought I told Maddox to hold
his position. Birkhead, see what he wants.

674
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:29,887
I'm sorry, sir. My orders
are to give these directly to you.

675
00:55:37,796 --> 00:55:40,731
"Request relief column.
Invasion imminent.

676
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:44,360
Murderers parachuting in
from the skies. "

677
00:55:46,438 --> 00:55:49,373
Son, are these Jap murderers
or Kraut murderers?

678
00:55:49,441 --> 00:55:51,534
The colonel
didn't specify, sir.

679
00:55:51,610 --> 00:55:53,601
You seen
these murderers, son?

680
00:55:53,679 --> 00:55:58,116
Um, no, sir. But Colonel Maddox has
seen lights in the hills after dark.

681
00:55:58,183 --> 00:56:02,119
This leads the colonel to believe
they're being dropped in at night, sir.

682
00:56:05,758 --> 00:56:07,692
You know, son,

683
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:10,661
Colonel Maddox is mad.

684
00:56:12,464 --> 00:56:14,398
He is?

685
00:56:14,466 --> 00:56:16,764
I'm getting that old
sinking feeling.

686
00:56:16,835 --> 00:56:19,770
Excuse me, General, but
since it's a bombing range,

687
00:56:19,838 --> 00:56:22,773
don't you think Colonel Maddox
would have some planes there, sir?

688
00:56:22,841 --> 00:56:24,775
Some airplanes.

689
00:56:24,843 --> 00:56:27,835
Yeah, well, he might have
a few planes there. So what?

690
00:56:27,913 --> 00:56:30,848
Well, I seem to recall
a huge stockpile of bombs, sir.

691
00:56:30,916 --> 00:56:33,851
Stock- I'm missing the movie.
I'm missing the movie!

692
00:56:33,919 --> 00:56:37,218
Considering Maddox's state of mind,
there's no telling what he might do.

693
00:56:37,289 --> 00:56:39,621
I thought it might be wise
if I take a jaunt out there...

694
00:56:39,691 --> 00:56:42,023
and see if I can't appease
the girl- uh, the colonel, sir.

695
00:56:42,094 --> 00:56:44,028
With your permission,
of course.

696
00:56:44,096 --> 00:56:47,031
Take my car, go out there
and keep that maniac at bay.

697
00:56:47,099 --> 00:56:50,034
- And don't let him get his hands on an airplane.
- Yes, sir!

698
00:56:50,102 --> 00:56:54,038
Sir, I'm going to take a rain check on
the movie. I've got a splitting headache.

699
00:56:54,106 --> 00:56:57,542
I'm sorry about your headache.
Can I call a car for you?

700
00:56:57,609 --> 00:57:01,978
- No, sir, I think I can persuade Capt.
Birkhead to give me- - Can I have my ticket?

701
00:57:02,047 --> 00:57:05,483
Loomis, use your head. Everybody knows
you flunked out of flight school.

702
00:57:05,551 --> 00:57:08,611
Trust me,
it'll never get that far.

703
00:57:17,963 --> 00:57:20,557
Whoa!

704
00:57:26,138 --> 00:57:28,072
If we don't paint
the windows,

705
00:57:28,140 --> 00:57:31,735
these lights will shine
over the water 30, 40 miles.

706
00:57:31,810 --> 00:57:36,042
You know, we could get new curtains.
I wouldn't mind that.

707
00:57:36,115 --> 00:57:40,984
That nice soldier said we could get
blackout curtains at Sears Roebuck.

708
00:57:41,053 --> 00:57:43,988
I wouldn't mind
redoing this whole room.

709
00:57:44,056 --> 00:57:46,991
Since Mama died I wouldn't mind
redoing the whole house.

710
00:57:47,059 --> 00:57:49,994
Knock down a few walls.
What do you think?

711
00:57:50,062 --> 00:57:52,030
Somebody should do
something.

712
00:57:52,097 --> 00:57:56,796
- Macey Douglas, will you please
take your gas mask off!

713
00:57:56,869 --> 00:58:00,805
- You know that is no way
to eat your soup!

714
00:58:02,074 --> 00:58:05,100
But Mom,
he likes it that way.

715
00:58:05,177 --> 00:58:08,613
- The lima beans can get through.
- Ward.

716
00:58:10,682 --> 00:58:14,709
- Mom? Dad? I'm leaving now.
- Green pig.

717
00:58:14,820 --> 00:58:18,221
- Have a good time.
- Betty, just a minute, um-

718
00:58:18,290 --> 00:58:21,589
- Look at you.
- Come in the living room. Let's-

719
00:58:21,660 --> 00:58:24,595
- Let's have a little talk.
- Don't ever do this again.

720
00:58:24,663 --> 00:58:27,598
We've never really had a-
a talk, have we, Betty?

721
00:58:27,666 --> 00:58:30,601
A father-daughter
kind of a talk.

722
00:58:31,670 --> 00:58:33,797
Betty,

723
00:58:35,374 --> 00:58:38,810
you know, I'm too old
to be in this war.

724
00:58:38,877 --> 00:58:42,313
The boys, Macey, the others,
they're too young.

725
00:58:42,381 --> 00:58:44,315
It's up to you.

726
00:58:44,383 --> 00:58:48,319
I don't know what they
told you at the USO,

727
00:58:48,387 --> 00:58:52,153
but you're going to be meeting
a lot of strange... men.

728
00:58:53,292 --> 00:58:55,226
Men in uniform.

729
00:58:57,296 --> 00:59:00,231
Boys a long way from home.
Lonely, desperate.

730
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:04,735
They really have one thing
on their minds.

731
00:59:06,872 --> 00:59:08,806
Show 'em
a good time.

732
00:59:14,046 --> 00:59:15,946
All right, you lovers!

733
00:59:16,014 --> 00:59:19,541
You can quit gettin' all dolled up.
We're not goin' to any dance.

734
00:59:19,618 --> 00:59:22,553
- What?
- We've just been posted on combat readiness.

735
00:59:22,621 --> 00:59:25,556
- Combat readiness?
- We gotta play wet nurse to Lulabelle tonight.

736
00:59:25,624 --> 00:59:28,491
Combat readiness?
Sarge, this is Hollywood!

737
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:32,496
Hollywood, is it, Foley? I guess they
didn't tell you Lana Turner's coming by...

738
00:59:32,564 --> 00:59:34,498
to keep us all
company tonight.

739
00:59:34,566 --> 00:59:36,500
Where's Sitarski?
That goldbrick!

740
00:59:36,568 --> 00:59:39,503
If he went AWOL,
I'll ream his ass!

741
00:59:39,571 --> 00:59:41,505
Hey, Sitarski,
you meatball!

742
00:59:46,078 --> 00:59:48,012
This here right here.

743
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:51,015
I want that there bunk
right there by the door!

744
00:59:51,083 --> 00:59:54,018
I don't want none of them
Asian enemies sneakin' up on me...

745
00:59:54,086 --> 00:59:56,020
while I'm in here
asleep!

746
00:59:56,088 --> 00:59:58,022
My name is
Ogden Johnson Jones.

747
00:59:58,090 --> 01:00:02,652
I ain't gonna enjoy it here, but I got
orders that say I's supposed to be here.

748
01:00:02,728 --> 01:00:06,664
And orders is orders. Is there
anybody in here that don't like it?

749
01:00:06,732 --> 01:00:09,667
Gimme a jar of that
white stencil paint.

750
01:00:09,735 --> 01:00:13,171
Now then, Ogden,
I know you're gonna like it here.

751
01:00:13,238 --> 01:00:15,672
There's a few rules
you gotta abide by.

752
01:00:15,741 --> 01:00:18,676
For example, down here, sir,
you'll notice...

753
01:00:18,744 --> 01:00:21,679
this white line, which is
the Mason-Dixon line.

754
01:00:21,747 --> 01:00:25,877
That is the north; this is the south.
Don't ever cross over there.

755
01:00:25,951 --> 01:00:29,887
Well, I'm from Tennessee and I'm
goin' home to visit my relatives.

756
01:00:29,955 --> 01:00:33,516
That's always nice, but this
is Mississippi. Don't ever cross there.

757
01:00:33,592 --> 01:00:37,528
- Yeah? Well, I wanna pick magnolia
flowers. - Oh-ho! Magnolias, you say.

758
01:00:37,596 --> 01:00:41,032
Well, you wouldn't dare
cross the Mexican border, would you?

759
01:00:41,099 --> 01:00:44,535
- Well, hola and a si, si, si to you.
- Ah, I knows!

760
01:00:44,603 --> 01:00:47,037
Nyuk-nyuk-nyuk! White flag.
I surrender. Bye-bye.

761
01:00:48,607 --> 01:00:51,576
- It never fails, you know. Those guys are idiots.
- Aaaah!

762
01:00:57,449 --> 01:01:01,647
Hey, what's happenin'?

763
01:01:01,720 --> 01:01:05,554
- Wally!
- Wally!

764
01:01:08,627 --> 01:01:10,652
- What?
- Hey.

765
01:01:10,729 --> 01:01:14,165
- They won't let nobody in without no uniform.
- Seen Betty in there?

766
01:01:14,232 --> 01:01:16,166
We only been here
ten minutes.

767
01:01:16,234 --> 01:01:19,169
Go get 'em, Wally!

768
01:01:19,237 --> 01:01:22,673
Who the hell are you supposed to be,
the admiral of the Hollywood navy?

769
01:01:22,741 --> 01:01:25,972
- I'm lookin' for somebody.
- How 'bout lookin' for a size 10 up your ass, huh?

770
01:01:27,979 --> 01:01:31,415
- Say, Wally, it's time to throw some chingazos!
- Orale, Wally!

771
01:01:31,483 --> 01:01:33,417
- Oh, no.
- Hi.

772
01:01:33,485 --> 01:01:35,419
- Hi.
- You know what?

773
01:01:35,487 --> 01:01:38,923
You got a lot of balls comin'
here tonight. You know why?

774
01:01:38,990 --> 01:01:42,357
'Cause when I get through with you,
you ain't gonna have none left.

775
01:01:42,427 --> 01:01:45,123
Hit him! Hit him!

776
01:01:45,197 --> 01:01:47,859
Hit the dude, Wally.

777
01:01:55,307 --> 01:01:58,037
Hey. Como esta?
Que pasa?

778
01:02:00,112 --> 01:02:03,479
- Hey.
- Hey.

779
01:02:03,548 --> 01:02:05,482
Listen,
I'll tell you what.

780
01:02:05,550 --> 01:02:08,951
Since I'm obviously interrupting
something important,

781
01:02:09,020 --> 01:02:11,318
he's all yours.

782
01:02:13,892 --> 01:02:16,827
- Poor bastard.
- I smell something burning.

783
01:02:16,895 --> 01:02:19,830
Yeah, it smells like garbage.

784
01:02:19,898 --> 01:02:22,332
Aaah! Aaah!

785
01:02:22,401 --> 01:02:25,837
- Look, lady, I've had it up to here about my clothes!
- Aaaaah!

786
01:02:25,904 --> 01:02:28,839
Wally! You're on fire!

787
01:02:33,979 --> 01:02:35,913
Ooh! Aah!
Ohh!

788
01:02:39,484 --> 01:02:41,918
Thank you.

789
01:02:41,987 --> 01:02:44,421
Break it up.

790
01:02:44,489 --> 01:02:46,423
Wally!

791
01:02:48,193 --> 01:02:51,629
- I have to talk to you.
- Wally, do you smell garbage burning?

792
01:02:51,696 --> 01:02:54,631
- Would you excuse us, sir?
- I wanna apologize for this afternoon.

793
01:02:54,699 --> 01:02:57,634
- We have nothing to talk about now.
- Sir, we're late for the dance.

794
01:02:57,702 --> 01:03:01,138
Don't go in there with him.
I know him. I know what he's like.

795
01:03:01,206 --> 01:03:03,985
Miss Douglas? Allow me.

796
01:03:12,126 --> 01:03:15,095
# Down by the Ohio #

797
01:03:15,163 --> 01:03:20,191
# I've got the cutest
sweetest oh-my-oh #

798
01:03:20,268 --> 01:03:24,227
- # He's just a country boy who works around farms #
- Wally's in the street!

799
01:03:24,305 --> 01:03:26,739
- # But he has his
charms # - What? - Hey!

800
01:03:26,808 --> 01:03:28,742
- You wanna dance?
- No!

801
01:03:28,810 --> 01:03:30,937
- You- You wanna dance?
- No!

802
01:03:37,018 --> 01:03:38,952
Aah!

803
01:03:40,855 --> 01:03:42,789
- Look, you, it's-
- Wally!

804
01:03:42,857 --> 01:03:45,792
- Dennis, what the- - What are
you doin'? That guy's a killer!

805
01:03:45,860 --> 01:03:48,795
- What have you got on?
- These uniforms work like a son of a bitch!

806
01:03:48,863 --> 01:03:51,297
Come on, Dennis, let's dance!

807
01:03:51,365 --> 01:03:54,300
- I don't believe it! You joined up?
- No!

808
01:03:54,368 --> 01:03:56,461
Wally, look. Western Costumes.
Just two dollars.

809
01:03:58,539 --> 01:04:01,474
- Care for a drink, Betty?
Gimme a couple of Cokes.

810
01:04:01,542 --> 01:04:03,976
- I'm not hungry.
- Couple of donuts too.

811
01:04:04,045 --> 01:04:06,843
Hey, you devil,
how about a deviled egg?

812
01:04:06,914 --> 01:04:09,348
- Oh, no, I hate eggs.
- My grandmother made 'em.

813
01:04:09,417 --> 01:04:11,851
- Would you care to dance?
- Yes.

814
01:04:11,919 --> 01:04:13,853
Excuse us, please.
Listen.

815
01:04:13,921 --> 01:04:16,856
That... is my
port of entry.

816
01:04:16,924 --> 01:04:19,859
Believe me, walk away.
Just walk away.

817
01:04:19,927 --> 01:04:21,895
I'm wa- I'm walking away.
I'm walking.

818
01:04:21,963 --> 01:04:25,694
- # They're just very ordinary #
- Your donut, Betty.

819
01:04:25,766 --> 01:04:27,700
- # By that I mean #
- I'll get it.

820
01:04:27,768 --> 01:04:30,703
- # Those heartbreakers haven't a chance #
- Wanna cut a rug with me?

821
01:04:30,771 --> 01:04:34,707
- Maybe have a little pick-me-up.
We could- - # With my new romance #

822
01:04:34,775 --> 01:04:37,300
- # Down by the old Ohio #
- Maybe later.

823
01:04:37,378 --> 01:04:41,314
# That's where I found him
I've got the cutest oh-my-oh #

824
01:04:41,382 --> 01:04:44,408
Betty, I think it's getting
a little crowded around here.

825
01:04:44,485 --> 01:04:47,420
Why don't we go and dance?

826
01:04:47,488 --> 01:04:50,719
# And jumpin'
jeepers creepers #

827
01:04:50,791 --> 01:04:53,055
- # When I'm in his arms #
- That's the man for me.

828
01:04:53,127 --> 01:04:56,460
# I get so oh-my-oh #

829
01:04:56,530 --> 01:04:58,020
# He is the only- #

830
01:05:00,101 --> 01:05:02,661
- Aaah!
- # -me so #

831
01:05:02,737 --> 01:05:07,174
- # He knows his chickens
and his cabbages too #

832
01:05:11,145 --> 01:05:14,740
# He's got that oh-my-oh
Oh-hi, oh-my #

833
01:05:14,815 --> 01:05:20,253
# Just wait 'til I get back
to O-hi-o #

834
01:05:45,212 --> 01:05:48,147
# Baby mine #

835
01:05:48,215 --> 01:05:52,811
# Don't you cry #

836
01:05:52,887 --> 01:05:56,118
# Baby mine #

837
01:05:56,190 --> 01:06:00,456
# Dry your eyes #

838
01:06:00,528 --> 01:06:05,761
# Rest your head
close to my heart #

839
01:06:05,833 --> 01:06:09,234
# Never to part, baby of- ##

840
01:06:09,303 --> 01:06:11,897
It sure is dark
out here, huh?

841
01:06:11,973 --> 01:06:14,908
You look out the windows,
you can't see a thing.

842
01:06:16,978 --> 01:06:19,947
This is just like
flying at night.

843
01:06:20,014 --> 01:06:23,450
It's sure a helluva lot
safer than flying at night.

844
01:06:23,517 --> 01:06:28,352
If I didn't know better, I'd swear we
were flying. This car feels like a plane.

845
01:06:28,422 --> 01:06:31,357
- Hey, what does this feel like?
- Loomis.

846
01:06:31,425 --> 01:06:34,360
Forward thrust? Donna,
doesn't that feel like forward thrust?

847
01:06:34,428 --> 01:06:36,362
- You're such a child.
- Yeah.

848
01:06:36,430 --> 01:06:38,364
I'll tell you what.

849
01:06:38,432 --> 01:06:43,495
You get me up in an airplane and then
we'll talk about forward thrust.

850
01:06:48,909 --> 01:06:52,868
- # He knows his chickens and his cabbages too #
- What's your real name, Sal?

851
01:06:52,947 --> 01:06:55,381
# But where the dickens did
he learn to "woo-woo" #

852
01:06:55,449 --> 01:06:57,383
- Raoul.
- I knew it.

853
01:06:57,451 --> 01:06:58,941
Lipschitz.

854
01:06:59,020 --> 01:07:01,580
# Just wait 'til
I get back to #

855
01:07:01,655 --> 01:07:06,024
# O-hi-o #

856
01:07:06,093 --> 01:07:08,357
# You may think
you've seen #

857
01:07:08,429 --> 01:07:10,863
# Lovers on the screen #

858
01:07:10,931 --> 01:07:14,924
# They're just very ordinary
By that I mean #

859
01:07:15,002 --> 01:07:19,462
# Those heartbreakers
haven't a chance #

860
01:07:19,540 --> 01:07:22,532
- # 'Gainst my new
romance # - Betty! - Wally!

861
01:07:22,610 --> 01:07:24,840
Betty!

862
01:07:24,912 --> 01:07:28,348
- # Down by the old Ohio That's where I found him #
- Wally!

863
01:07:28,416 --> 01:07:31,351
- # I've got the cutest oh-my-oh #
- Hey, come on!

864
01:07:31,419 --> 01:07:35,355
You'll never drink in here again,
you drunken son of a bitch!

865
01:07:41,662 --> 01:07:45,098
# I get so oh-my-oh #

866
01:07:45,166 --> 01:07:49,034
# He is the only one
who ever thrilled me so #

867
01:07:49,103 --> 01:07:51,697
They want no drunks
botherin' and grabbin' em.

868
01:07:51,772 --> 01:07:55,333
# He knows his chickens
and his cabbages too #

869
01:07:55,409 --> 01:07:59,709
All right? I'm sorry.

870
01:07:59,780 --> 01:08:02,715
- # He's got my oh-my-oh
Oh-my-oh-my #

871
01:08:02,783 --> 01:08:04,717
- # Just wait 'til I get back #
- No drinking!

872
01:08:04,785 --> 01:08:07,811
- # To O-hi-o ##
- I'm sorry.

873
01:08:07,888 --> 01:08:10,254
No!

874
01:08:12,993 --> 01:08:16,929
- Ladies and gentlemen, may I
please have your attention?

875
01:08:16,997 --> 01:08:18,931
Attention, please,
everyone.

876
01:08:18,999 --> 01:08:21,433
Listen up now, everyone.
All right.

877
01:08:21,502 --> 01:08:23,732
Meyer,
come on up here.

878
01:08:23,804 --> 01:08:25,738
- # Hey, listen #
- All right.

879
01:08:25,806 --> 01:08:29,242
- The jitterbug contest
is about to begin.

880
01:08:29,310 --> 01:08:33,246
And now I'm going to introduce
our judge for the contest,

881
01:08:33,314 --> 01:08:35,748
Mr. Meyer Mishkin
of RKO Pictures!

882
01:08:35,816 --> 01:08:38,410
RKO Pictures!

883
01:08:38,486 --> 01:08:42,479
- Meyer is an agent at RKO Pictures
and he's- - Uh, talent scout.

884
01:08:42,556 --> 01:08:44,490
Talent scout.
All right.

885
01:08:44,558 --> 01:08:46,992
Tell them about
first prize, huh?

886
01:08:47,061 --> 01:08:49,996
Uh, first prize is a seven-year
contract at RKO Pictures.

887
01:08:50,064 --> 01:08:52,430
Seven years! Did you hear that?

888
01:08:52,500 --> 01:08:56,436
- Let's get outta here so
these slobs can't bother us.

889
01:08:56,504 --> 01:08:59,701
You wanna dance with me?
I'm in the USO! I'll dance with you!

890
01:09:07,982 --> 01:09:09,916
Sailor, please!

891
01:09:09,984 --> 01:09:11,918
Let's get outta here.

892
01:09:11,986 --> 01:09:14,784
I don't wanna go!

893
01:09:14,855 --> 01:09:17,790
Ladies and gentlemen, I want you
to count down with me...

894
01:09:17,858 --> 01:09:19,792
on this momentous,
tremendous,

895
01:09:19,860 --> 01:09:21,589
absolutely pretty...
important occasion.

896
01:09:21,662 --> 01:09:23,596
All right.

897
01:09:25,332 --> 01:09:28,927
- We can't go yet. You wanna dance?
- Sure, dolly.

898
01:09:29,003 --> 01:09:32,404
- And...
- Ten!

899
01:09:32,473 --> 01:09:34,941
- What the hell are you- Hey!

900
01:09:35,009 --> 01:09:36,943
You crazy

01:09:40,681 --> 01:09:42,376

- Six! Five!

903
01:09:42,449 --> 01:09:44,383
- A what?
- Gimme a break!

904
01:09:44,451 --> 01:09:45,918
Time!

905
01:09:46,086 --> 01:09:48,247
- Four!
- Please.

906
01:09:48,322 --> 01:09:50,586
- Three!
- Aaah!

907
01:09:50,658 --> 01:09:52,683
- Two!
- Wait for me, Stretch!

908
01:09:52,760 --> 01:09:54,455
One!

909
01:09:54,528 --> 01:09:57,361
And grab your partner
and take it away!

910
01:09:57,431 --> 01:10:00,366
Wait for me, Stretch!

911
01:10:04,838 --> 01:10:08,934
- Wally!
- Wait a minute, Betty! We gotta dance!

912
01:10:18,385 --> 01:10:20,319
- Ohh!
- Ahh!

913
01:10:20,387 --> 01:10:23,322
Aah!

914
01:10:24,758 --> 01:10:27,625
Aah!

915
01:10:27,695 --> 01:10:29,629
Ohh!

916
01:10:37,638 --> 01:10:39,572
Look out!

917
01:10:45,779 --> 01:10:48,339
Stretch!

918
01:11:13,841 --> 01:11:15,775
Watch it!

919
01:11:17,845 --> 01:11:21,713
Stretch!

920
01:11:21,782 --> 01:11:23,053
- Ohhh!
- Who's that?

921
01:11:23,088 --> 01:11:24,324
- Ohhh!
- Who's that?

922
01:11:30,237 --> 01:11:32,171
Get awa- Aah!

923
01:11:32,239 --> 01:11:34,173
Ooh, Stretch.

924
01:11:36,644 --> 01:11:38,578
Whoa!

925
01:11:49,890 --> 01:11:52,552
Aaah!

926
01:12:07,575 --> 01:12:09,600
Whoo!

927
01:12:18,486 --> 01:12:20,420
Whoo!

928
01:12:22,490 --> 01:12:24,424
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

929
01:12:56,323 --> 01:12:58,257
Uh-oh.

930
01:12:59,927 --> 01:13:03,055
Look at that!

931
01:13:22,216 --> 01:13:24,582
Wally! Hey, Wally!

932
01:13:40,201 --> 01:13:42,135
That's my best friend!

933
01:13:42,203 --> 01:13:44,034
And he's dancin'.

934
01:13:44,105 --> 01:13:46,539
What's that guy's name?
What a dancer!

935
01:13:55,182 --> 01:13:58,481
Watch it, Wally!

936
01:13:58,552 --> 01:14:01,180
Wally!

937
01:14:05,993 --> 01:14:07,927
Well, well, well.

938
01:14:07,995 --> 01:14:10,930
Just the son of a bitch
I'm lookin' for.

939
01:14:16,070 --> 01:14:18,004
You son of a bitch!

940
01:14:18,072 --> 01:14:21,007
Wait a second!

941
01:14:21,075 --> 01:14:24,511
Wait, guys!
Now wait a second! Wait!

942
01:14:53,741 --> 01:14:55,675
Are you okay?

943
01:14:55,743 --> 01:14:58,177
Stop! Stop!

944
01:15:01,248 --> 01:15:03,182
Ohh!

945
01:15:03,250 --> 01:15:05,184
Ohh!

946
01:15:23,871 --> 01:15:25,805
I love you, Stretch!

947
01:15:25,873 --> 01:15:27,738
Aaah!

948
01:15:27,875 --> 01:15:30,241
Right engine, left engine.

949
01:15:30,311 --> 01:15:33,246
I don't see any planes
out here, Loomis.

950
01:15:33,314 --> 01:15:37,250
Do you know what's gonna happen to you
if there aren't any planes?

951
01:15:37,318 --> 01:15:40,253
- Can you possibly imagine?
- Donna, would you just relax?

952
01:15:40,321 --> 01:15:42,789
- Loomis.
- Donna, I'm gonna look around.

953
01:15:42,856 --> 01:15:44,790
I'll be right back.

954
01:15:52,333 --> 01:15:54,267
Hello!

955
01:15:57,171 --> 01:15:59,105
Hello!

956
01:15:59,173 --> 01:16:01,107
Anybody home?

957
01:16:05,546 --> 01:16:08,674
No! Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!

958
01:16:08,749 --> 01:16:11,980
Don't shoot! Please don't shoot!

959
01:16:12,052 --> 01:16:14,418
Identify yourself!

960
01:16:14,488 --> 01:16:19,323
Captain Loomis Birkhead,
United States Army!

961
01:16:19,393 --> 01:16:23,921
Birkhead? What kind of
stupid name is that?

962
01:16:23,998 --> 01:16:26,762
Just stand right there.
Winowski!

963
01:16:26,834 --> 01:16:29,735
Little tall for a Jap,
wouldn't you say?

964
01:16:29,803 --> 01:16:32,704
Yeah, but those Japs
are sneaky bastards, sir.

965
01:16:32,773 --> 01:16:34,707
- You never know.
- You're right.

966
01:16:34,775 --> 01:16:36,675
Check him for stilts.

967
01:16:39,413 --> 01:16:41,347
S- Stilts, sir?

968
01:16:41,415 --> 01:16:43,349
- Do it.
- Yo!

969
01:16:48,022 --> 01:16:49,956
Oww! Ooh!
God!

970
01:16:50,024 --> 01:16:51,651
Son of a bitch!

971
01:16:51,725 --> 01:16:55,161
Ah, thank God, Captain.

972
01:16:55,229 --> 01:16:57,663
Thank God you got through.

973
01:17:01,235 --> 01:17:04,671
My troops.
Where are my troops?

974
01:17:04,738 --> 01:17:06,672
- Stilwell promised me troops.
- Yes, sir.

975
01:17:06,740 --> 01:17:10,676
- Uh, you see, w-we're a little,
uh, shorthanded, sir. - Shorthanded?

976
01:17:10,744 --> 01:17:13,178
- Stilwell's trying to hold L.A.
- Stilwell? L.A.?

977
01:17:13,247 --> 01:17:16,683
Well, my God, doesn't he realize
how desperate my situation is here?

978
01:17:16,750 --> 01:17:19,685
They're parachuting
murderers into these hills,

979
01:17:19,753 --> 01:17:22,688
and now I'm getting reports
of secret airstrips...

980
01:17:22,756 --> 01:17:25,691
hidden away in
the alfalfa fields of Pomona!

981
01:17:25,759 --> 01:17:29,058
Colonel, you don't, uh-

982
01:17:29,129 --> 01:17:32,428
You don't have any bombers
here, do ya, sir?

983
01:17:32,499 --> 01:17:34,433
Bombers?

984
01:17:34,501 --> 01:17:36,435
If I had bombers,
son,

985
01:17:36,503 --> 01:17:39,939
I'd be bombin' the hell out of 'em
right now!

986
01:17:40,007 --> 01:17:42,737
No planes?

987
01:17:43,811 --> 01:17:46,245
Boy, am I
in trouble now.

988
01:17:49,516 --> 01:17:54,112
Son, the only plane I got is that
shit-on-a-shingle trainer sittin' over there.

989
01:18:00,260 --> 01:18:03,093
It's fine, it's fine. Let's go.

990
01:18:03,163 --> 01:18:06,098
Sir, I happen to have
a reconnaissance expert...

991
01:18:06,166 --> 01:18:10,102
from our intelligence office
in Washington with us in the car and...

992
01:18:11,572 --> 01:18:13,506
with your permission,
sir,

993
01:18:13,574 --> 01:18:16,907
we'd like to take that trainer
and try to spot that enemy airfield.

994
01:18:18,679 --> 01:18:23,207
Why, son, tha-that plane doesn't have
any guns on it. You're talkin' suicide.

995
01:18:24,351 --> 01:18:26,285
I have no other choice.

996
01:18:28,169 --> 01:18:29,932
Ladies and gentlemen,
everywhere I look...

997
01:18:30,004 --> 01:18:32,939
soldiers are fighting sailors,
sailors are fighting marines.

998
01:18:33,007 --> 01:18:35,942
Directly in front of me
I see a flying blond floozy.

999
01:18:36,010 --> 01:18:39,411
Everywhere I look, everywhere,
pure pandemonium- pandemonium!

1000
01:18:53,394 --> 01:18:57,831
I'm gonna do your head jus' like
ol' Brer Rabbit did to the tar baby!

1001
01:18:57,899 --> 01:19:00,333
Don't you hear
that radio over there?

1002
01:19:00,401 --> 01:19:03,802
- I'll take your head off.
- Our boys are fightin' each other down there.

1003
01:19:03,872 --> 01:19:07,467
If there's one thing I can't stand,
it's Americans fighting Americans.

1004
01:19:07,542 --> 01:19:09,476
- Jones!
- Yes, sir.

1005
01:19:09,544 --> 01:19:12,604
- You wanna fight in this man's army?
- Yes, sir, I wanna fight!

1006
01:19:12,680 --> 01:19:16,776
Gentlemen, draw your gear and weapons
and prepare to mount up.

1007
01:19:16,851 --> 01:19:18,785
Immediately! On the double!
Let's go!

1008
01:19:25,860 --> 01:19:27,794
Jones,
port hatch.

1009
01:19:27,862 --> 01:19:31,298
- What's a port hatch, Sarge?
- The back door, Ogden!

1010
01:19:32,500 --> 01:19:34,730
Foley,
fuel pumps, prime one.

1011
01:19:34,802 --> 01:19:36,736
- Fuel pumps, prime one.
- And two.

1012
01:19:36,804 --> 01:19:38,738
- And two.
- Fuel pumps primed.

1013
01:19:38,806 --> 01:19:41,400
Magnetos,
spark one.

1014
01:19:41,476 --> 01:19:43,410
- Magnetos, spark one.
- And two.

1015
01:19:43,478 --> 01:19:47,005
All right, boost and start 'er up.

1016
01:19:56,925 --> 01:19:58,859
Parking brake,
release.

1017
01:19:58,927 --> 01:20:01,521
Uh, flaps up.
Trim set.

1018
01:20:01,596 --> 01:20:04,759
We're ready.
Radio on.

1019
01:20:04,832 --> 01:20:06,766
- Jesus Christ!
- What?

1020
01:20:06,834 --> 01:20:09,132
This thing
hasn't got a radio!

1021
01:20:09,203 --> 01:20:12,730
Colonel, this thing
hasn't got a radio!

1022
01:20:12,807 --> 01:20:14,934
What radio?

1023
01:20:15,009 --> 01:20:17,944
It hasn't got a radio!

1024
01:20:18,012 --> 01:20:22,142
I gotta let Interceptor Command know I'm
up there! I don't wanna get my ass shot off!

1025
01:20:22,216 --> 01:20:26,653
Hell, son, you can't
call Interceptor Command!

1026
01:20:26,721 --> 01:20:29,315
That plane
doesn't have a radio!

1027
01:20:29,390 --> 01:20:32,416
I know it doesn't
have a radio!

1028
01:20:32,493 --> 01:20:35,929
I know it doesn't have a radio,
but I got a telephone!

1029
01:20:35,997 --> 01:20:39,592
Don't worry!
I'll call them for you!

1030
01:20:39,667 --> 01:20:42,966
You got a telephone.
Okay.

1031
01:20:43,037 --> 01:20:44,971
Go!

1032
01:20:46,908 --> 01:20:50,207
Wonderful! Bomb the hell
out of 'em, son!

1033
01:20:50,278 --> 01:20:52,712
That's it!
Straight away, son!

1034
01:20:55,216 --> 01:20:59,152
Oh, no. Hey! Whoa, look out, son!
Watch it! Hey!

1035
01:20:59,220 --> 01:21:03,247
Take your foot off
the right brake, son!

1036
01:21:03,324 --> 01:21:06,020
- Loomis, stop showing off.
- Aaaah!

1037
01:21:06,094 --> 01:21:08,028
Hey! Come on!
Get down!

1038
01:21:08,096 --> 01:21:11,463
Hey! Son!
You're goin' the wrong way!

1039
01:21:11,532 --> 01:21:15,263
Equest-ray emergency oops-tray
and we're eady-ray to oll-ray.

1040
01:21:22,877 --> 01:21:24,811
Everybody
fall in!

1041
01:21:26,414 --> 01:21:28,382
And... salute!

1042
01:21:32,286 --> 01:21:36,052
- Full throttle, max power, past the point of rejection.
- You're gonna hit the tower.

1043
01:21:36,124 --> 01:21:39,719
- Whoa!
- Naw, we missed it.

1044
01:21:42,363 --> 01:21:44,160
This is S.L.P.

1045
01:21:48,403 --> 01:21:51,702
How do you read me?

1046
01:21:51,773 --> 01:21:54,207
Interceptor Command,
this is Colonel Maddox.

1047
01:21:54,275 --> 01:21:56,209
Hello?

1048
01:21:56,277 --> 01:21:58,211
My God,
we've been cut off!

1049
01:21:58,312 --> 01:22:01,110
Did you ever see
an elephant fly?

1050
01:22:01,182 --> 01:22:04,743
- Well, I seen a horsefly.
- I seen a dragonfly!

1051
01:22:04,819 --> 01:22:07,549
I seen a housefly.

1052
01:22:07,622 --> 01:22:10,284
See, I've seen
all that too.

1053
01:22:10,358 --> 01:22:12,292
I've seen
a peanut stand...

1054
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:14,294
and heard
a rubber band.

1055
01:22:14,362 --> 01:22:17,297
I seen a needle
that winked its eye.

1056
01:22:17,365 --> 01:22:20,766
# But I be done seen
about ever'thing #

1057
01:22:20,835 --> 01:22:23,963
- # When I see an elephant fly #
- What you say, boy?

1058
01:22:24,038 --> 01:22:26,905
- I said, when I see an elephant fly.
- Sir.

1059
01:22:26,974 --> 01:22:29,909
- They're rioting in the streets.
- Who's rioting?

1060
01:22:29,977 --> 01:22:32,912
- Soldiers and sailors.
- I seen a polka dot railroad tie!

1061
01:22:32,980 --> 01:22:34,914
- And zoot suiters.
- Zoot suiters?

1062
01:22:34,982 --> 01:22:37,849
- Yes, sir.
- Sounds like a matter for the police.

1063
01:22:37,919 --> 01:22:39,978
Police, shore patrols, MPs.

1064
01:22:40,054 --> 01:22:43,285
Let them handle the riots.
I'll handle the Japanese.

1065
01:22:43,357 --> 01:22:45,291
- That's all, Sergeant.
- Yes, sir.

1066
01:22:45,359 --> 01:22:48,021
# And I just laughed
'til I thought I'd die #

1067
01:22:48,096 --> 01:22:50,530
# But I be done seen
'bout ever'thing #

1068
01:22:50,598 --> 01:22:54,534
Get outta the way. I can't see
the screen. Down in front, you!

1069
01:22:54,602 --> 01:22:57,969
Oh, relax, watch the movie.

1070
01:23:07,849 --> 01:23:11,080
# But I be done seen
'bout ever'thing #

1071
01:23:11,152 --> 01:23:15,088
# When I see
an elephant fly-y-y #

1072
01:23:15,156 --> 01:23:18,455
# With the wind #

1073
01:23:18,526 --> 01:23:23,327
# When I see
an elephant #

1074
01:23:23,397 --> 01:23:26,332
# Fly ##

1075
01:23:30,004 --> 01:23:33,906
- Colonel Maddox!
Aircraft approaching, sir!

1076
01:23:45,052 --> 01:23:47,486
Hold your fire.
Pass it on.

1077
01:23:47,555 --> 01:23:49,716
Hold your fire. Pass it on.

1078
01:23:49,790 --> 01:23:52,384
- Hold your fire.
- Hold your fire.

1079
01:23:52,460 --> 01:23:56,396
Aah! Ohh! Mmm.

1080
01:23:56,464 --> 01:23:58,898
My leg.
It won't wake up.

1081
01:23:58,966 --> 01:24:01,901
Come on, wake up.
Wake up, wake up!

1082
01:24:08,342 --> 01:24:10,276
Ground crew!

1083
01:24:10,344 --> 01:24:12,972
What form of lunatic
is that?

1084
01:24:13,047 --> 01:24:16,483
What kind of lunatic
runs this place? Come on!

1085
01:24:16,551 --> 01:24:18,485
Yo.

1086
01:24:18,553 --> 01:24:21,021
Come on, wake up, you moron.

1087
01:24:21,088 --> 01:24:24,421
- Not now, Winowski,
you stupid soda jerk.

1088
01:24:24,492 --> 01:24:26,790
Come on-

1089
01:24:26,861 --> 01:24:28,795
Huh?

1090
01:24:28,863 --> 01:24:31,297
Mmm.

1091
01:24:35,903 --> 01:24:37,928
He's on the level, sir!

1092
01:24:38,005 --> 01:24:39,939
Yaah!

1093
01:24:45,046 --> 01:24:48,015
Identify yourself!

1094
01:24:48,082 --> 01:24:50,516
Captain Wild Bill Kelso,

1095
01:24:50,585 --> 01:24:52,519
United States Army
Air Corps.

1096
01:24:52,587 --> 01:24:54,521
Where the hell am I?

1097
01:24:54,589 --> 01:24:57,524
- Barstow. Where you comin' from?
- San Francisco.

1098
01:24:57,592 --> 01:25:01,961
Been trackin' a Jap squadron for a day
and a half. Lost 'em somewhere over Fresno.

1099
01:25:02,029 --> 01:25:04,964
- I'm from Olene, Illinois.
- Tough shit.

1100
01:25:07,468 --> 01:25:09,402
You see any Japs
around here?

1101
01:25:09,470 --> 01:25:11,904
Hell, son,
they're all over the place.

1102
01:25:11,973 --> 01:25:16,672
They got a secret air base down in Pomona.
That's where they're all comin' from.

1103
01:25:17,778 --> 01:25:19,712
Pomona.

1104
01:25:19,780 --> 01:25:22,078
Which way is, uh,
Pomona?

1105
01:25:22,149 --> 01:25:24,447
That way.
Toward L.A.

1106
01:25:41,469 --> 01:25:43,801
Heave!

1107
01:25:43,871 --> 01:25:45,964
Aaah!

1108
01:25:49,577 --> 01:25:52,011
Aaah!

1109
01:25:52,079 --> 01:25:54,013
Get away!
Go on! Go on!

1110
01:25:57,084 --> 01:25:59,518
My name's
Wild Bill Kelso,

1111
01:25:59,587 --> 01:26:01,521
and don't you forget it.

1112
01:26:04,258 --> 01:26:07,193
That's the kind of talk
I like to hear, boy!

1113
01:26:07,261 --> 01:26:09,661
That's it!
Lemme hear your guns!

1114
01:26:13,234 --> 01:26:16,431
- My guns?
- I wanna hear what they sound like.

1115
01:26:16,504 --> 01:26:19,439
Let me hear 'em!

1116
01:26:26,113 --> 01:26:28,741
Aaaaaah!

1117
01:26:28,816 --> 01:26:31,341
Aaaaah-ha-ha-ha!

1118
01:26:33,120 --> 01:26:35,088
Aaah!

1119
01:26:43,664 --> 01:26:46,929
Vaya con Dios,
my friend!

1120
01:26:47,001 --> 01:26:49,401
To Hollywood...
and glory!

1121
01:26:49,470 --> 01:26:51,537
Ha-ha-ha!

1122
01:27:07,486 --> 01:27:09,420
This thing
handles pretty well,

1123
01:27:09,488 --> 01:27:11,422
even if it's not
a B-17.

1124
01:27:11,490 --> 01:27:13,424
But...

1125
01:27:13,492 --> 01:27:15,926
does it have
much range, Loomis?

1126
01:27:15,994 --> 01:27:18,428
- Huh?
- I mean,

1127
01:27:18,497 --> 01:27:21,933
do you think it'll stay up
for a long time?

1128
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:25,936
Sure. Hell, we've used less
than a quarter of a tank already.

1129
01:27:26,004 --> 01:27:29,440
Look. We're already over
the Riverside County Reservoir.

1130
01:27:32,878 --> 01:27:34,812
Army flash, Army flash.

1131
01:27:34,880 --> 01:27:37,314
Post, Riverside
County Reservoir.

1132
01:27:37,383 --> 01:27:39,317
Code name,
Strawberry.

1133
01:27:39,385 --> 01:27:41,444
Three single-engine
aircraft.

1134
01:27:41,520 --> 01:27:43,454
Three single-engine
aircraft heard...

1135
01:27:43,522 --> 01:27:45,456
five miles northeast
of Strawberry,

1136
01:27:45,524 --> 01:27:47,458
proceeding west,
high altitude.

1137
01:27:47,526 --> 01:27:50,962
- Strawberry's in sector 14.
- No clearance for aircraft in 14.

1138
01:27:51,029 --> 01:27:54,965
- I repeat, no clearance. Request visual information.
- Visual information unavailable.

1139
01:27:55,033 --> 01:27:56,967
Try to contact aircraft
by radio.

1140
01:27:57,035 --> 01:27:59,970
Tangerine confirms Strawberry aircraft
proceeding west.

1141
01:28:00,038 --> 01:28:01,972
Attention, all units!
Condition yellow!

1142
01:28:02,040 --> 01:28:04,474
I repeat, yellow alert!

1143
01:28:19,525 --> 01:28:21,686
Ohh!

1144
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:25,560
What you need is a little pick-me-up.

1145
01:28:25,631 --> 01:28:28,293
I'll give you a-

1146
01:28:31,203 --> 01:28:33,501
Aaaah!

1147
01:28:34,907 --> 01:28:37,842
There they are, men!
Let's get 'em!

1148
01:28:42,881 --> 01:28:45,816
Oh, no!

1149
01:28:57,129 --> 01:28:59,529
Aaaah!

1150
01:29:08,674 --> 01:29:10,938
Aaaaah!

1151
01:29:15,948 --> 01:29:17,848
Yaaaah!

1152
01:29:23,522 --> 01:29:26,923
What the hell do you people
think you're doing?

1153
01:29:26,992 --> 01:29:29,927
You're acting like a bunch
of Tojo stooges!

1154
01:29:29,995 --> 01:29:32,793
You wanna put Yamamoto
in the White House?

1155
01:29:32,865 --> 01:29:37,063
The Axis is crawling like
a slime all over Europe.

1156
01:29:37,135 --> 01:29:41,333
I can't believe it! Americans fighting
Americans! We got the lousy Huns to fight!

1157
01:29:41,406 --> 01:29:44,842
Lima Bean reporting aircraft engines
heard east, proceeding west,

1158
01:29:44,910 --> 01:29:46,844
altitude high.

1159
01:29:46,912 --> 01:29:49,847
- Lima Bean is sector 13.
- There's no clearance on 13.

1160
01:29:49,915 --> 01:29:52,850
- Request status on radio contact.
- Negative radio contact.

1161
01:29:52,918 --> 01:29:56,854
- Aircraft refuses to respond.
- Area airport activity negative.

1162
01:29:56,922 --> 01:29:59,186
Go to blue.

1163
01:29:59,258 --> 01:30:01,192
Condition blue.

1164
01:30:03,962 --> 01:30:08,524
- Well, ladies and gentlemen,
that just about wraps up...

1165
01:30:08,600 --> 01:30:11,535
another evening's entertainment here
at the Crystal Ballroom...

1166
01:30:11,603 --> 01:30:13,537
in downtown Los Angeles.

1167
01:30:13,605 --> 01:30:16,540
I hope you enjoyed
tonight's program.

1168
01:30:16,608 --> 01:30:21,545
I'd like to thank all the Gls for
helping make tonight's evening such a-

1169
01:30:21,613 --> 01:30:23,547
a memorable occasion.

1170
01:30:23,615 --> 01:30:26,914
Maybe in the future we can
have some Negroes come in...

1171
01:30:26,985 --> 01:30:29,920
- and we'll stage a race riot right here.
- Wally!

1172
01:30:29,988 --> 01:30:34,891
This is Sal Stewart saying,
I hope you had a good time.

1173
01:30:34,960 --> 01:30:37,394
We're gonna be
boogie-woogie-ing our way...

1174
01:30:37,462 --> 01:30:40,226
right... across...
the street... soon.

1175
01:30:40,299 --> 01:30:43,234
So stay tuned
to this station.

1176
01:30:44,836 --> 01:30:48,738
- Next week we'll be back. Hope you had a good time.
- Aaah!

1177
01:31:03,922 --> 01:31:07,449
Ohh. Ohh.

1178
01:31:17,002 --> 01:31:18,936
Aah!

1179
01:31:20,606 --> 01:31:23,268
Ohh!

1180
01:31:23,342 --> 01:31:25,276
Oh, no!

1181
01:31:25,344 --> 01:31:27,278
Aah! Ohh!

1182
01:31:28,614 --> 01:31:30,980
Stretch!
Oh, boy!

1183
01:31:31,049 --> 01:31:33,017
Aah! Ohh!

1184
01:31:34,853 --> 01:31:37,822
Hey, you!

1185
01:31:37,889 --> 01:31:40,619
Make no mistake about this:

1186
01:31:40,692 --> 01:31:43,627
Japs do not surrender and
they don't take prisoners.

1187
01:31:43,695 --> 01:31:47,131
They have only one idea in mind.
Do you know what that is, sailor?

1188
01:31:47,199 --> 01:31:49,133
- Kill!
- No!

1189
01:31:49,201 --> 01:31:53,137
- That's right! To kill you,
to kill your families!

1190
01:31:53,205 --> 01:31:56,140
To kill your families,
mothers, loved ones and pets...

1191
01:31:56,208 --> 01:31:59,644
- and keep on killing until
they conquer the world!

1192
01:31:59,711 --> 01:32:01,645
- And when they do...
- Wally!

1193
01:32:01,713 --> 01:32:05,649
you won't be able to speak your free
mind or worship God in your own way.

1194
01:32:05,717 --> 01:32:09,153
- Pardon me.
- You won't be able to walk down Main Street anymore.

1195
01:32:09,221 --> 01:32:12,156
- Stretch! Stretch!
- Hey, lady, what are you doin'?

1196
01:32:12,224 --> 01:32:15,591
Stretch!

1197
01:32:17,663 --> 01:32:21,099
- Look at Santy Claus. Isn't he cute?
- No!

1198
01:32:21,166 --> 01:32:24,533
- You think the Japanese believe in Santy Claus?
- No!

1199
01:32:24,603 --> 01:32:26,468
Instead of turkey
for Christmas dinner,

1200
01:32:26,538 --> 01:32:30,474
- how would ya like to have raw fish heads and rice?
- No!

1201
01:32:30,542 --> 01:32:33,477
- You think the Krauts believe in Walt Disney?
- Yeah!

1202
01:32:33,545 --> 01:32:36,912
- Well, was that Mickey Mouse blitzkriegin' across France?
- No!

1203
01:32:36,982 --> 01:32:38,916
- Pluto in Poland?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

1204
01:32:38,984 --> 01:32:42,420
- Or Donald Duck at Pearl Harbor?
- No!

1205
01:32:42,487 --> 01:32:46,048
- This time we free the world
or we lose it!

1206
01:32:46,124 --> 01:32:47,955
We win or die tryin'!

1207
01:32:48,026 --> 01:32:51,223
Donna, wouldja lay off?
I'm tryin' to steer!

1208
01:32:51,296 --> 01:32:53,730
What's wrong?
You're not airborne yet.

1209
01:32:53,799 --> 01:32:57,735
What are you talkin' about? Look out
the window. Of course we're airborne!

1210
01:32:57,803 --> 01:33:00,237
We are,
but you're not.

1211
01:33:04,109 --> 01:33:06,976
Post, Cauliflower, aircraft 12:00,
proceeding west.

1212
01:33:07,045 --> 01:33:09,479
Sector 12.
They're heading for L.A.

1213
01:33:09,548 --> 01:33:11,482
What about visual
information, sir?

1214
01:33:11,550 --> 01:33:14,883
To hell with visual information.
They're Japs. Let's go to red.

1215
01:33:14,953 --> 01:33:17,888
Red alert for Los Angeles.

1216
01:33:17,956 --> 01:33:20,857
Red alert.

1217
01:33:20,926 --> 01:33:23,861
We sure didn't start this war,

1218
01:33:23,929 --> 01:33:25,920
but, by God,
we're gonna finish it!

1219
01:33:43,215 --> 01:33:45,308
Japs. Japs.

1220
01:33:45,383 --> 01:33:48,819
This is it! Let's show those
lousy Huns what we got!

1221
01:33:52,691 --> 01:33:55,353
Prepare to mount up.
Foley, let's go.

1222
01:33:58,230 --> 01:34:01,961
- All right, you wise "boids"!
- Now what?

1223
01:34:04,636 --> 01:34:07,264
- You!
- Aah!

1224
01:34:08,373 --> 01:34:10,807
Hi, Stretch!

1225
01:34:25,592 --> 01:34:29,028
Ward!
What's all that noise?

1226
01:34:29,096 --> 01:34:31,360
Are the Sciolis
having a party?

1227
01:35:03,197 --> 01:35:05,859
Colonel!

1228
01:35:05,933 --> 01:35:07,867
Mmm.

1229
01:35:12,873 --> 01:35:15,307
Ein Amerikan.

1230
01:35:16,743 --> 01:35:18,802
Invasion.

1231
01:35:18,879 --> 01:35:20,972
Japanese.

1232
01:35:22,249 --> 01:35:24,240
Joan!

1233
01:35:29,957 --> 01:35:32,050
Attack!

1234
01:35:40,400 --> 01:35:43,699
Yeah, Winchester.

1235
01:35:50,711 --> 01:35:53,805
Tell your... mother...

1236
01:35:53,881 --> 01:35:57,874
Mom, Dad's got something
stuck in his throat!

1237
01:35:57,951 --> 01:35:59,543
What is it, dear?

1238
01:35:59,620 --> 01:36:02,316
Invasion!

1239
01:36:04,958 --> 01:36:07,984
Get me a spotlight down here.
Here we go.

1240
01:36:16,036 --> 01:36:20,268
All right, you dog asses!
Haul in here! Ten-hut!

1241
01:36:20,340 --> 01:36:23,639
- Big brass, Sarge.
- General Stilwell.

1242
01:36:23,710 --> 01:36:27,111
- What a mess.
What a goddamn mess!

1243
01:36:28,548 --> 01:36:30,448
- Motor Sergeant Frank Tree...
- Bressler!

1244
01:36:30,517 --> 01:36:32,951
- reporting for combat duty, sir!
- Get me Interceptor Command!

1245
01:36:33,020 --> 01:36:35,318
- Is there a phone around here?
- In the theater, sir.

1246
01:36:35,389 --> 01:36:38,358
- Get on it. Sergeant!
- Yes, sir!

1247
01:36:38,425 --> 01:36:41,360
Secure this area.
Give me a one-block perimeter.

1248
01:36:41,428 --> 01:36:44,363
Yes, sir!
What's the plan of action, sir?

1249
01:36:44,431 --> 01:36:46,365
Hold the block.

1250
01:36:46,433 --> 01:36:49,095
You can hold one block,
can't you?

1251
01:37:05,552 --> 01:37:07,486
It's quiet.

1252
01:37:10,357 --> 01:37:12,291
Too quiet.

1253
01:37:26,006 --> 01:37:30,272
Is the target
in sight yet, Loomis?

1254
01:37:30,344 --> 01:37:35,111
Oh, it will be, just as soon
as I make it through these...

1255
01:37:35,182 --> 01:37:37,116
hills.

1256
01:37:52,399 --> 01:37:55,334
Do you hear that?

1257
01:37:57,237 --> 01:37:59,171
Yeah.

1258
01:37:59,239 --> 01:38:02,367
More thrust! Oh!

1259
01:38:02,442 --> 01:38:04,376
Ohh! Ohh!

1260
01:38:30,737 --> 01:38:34,673
- I see the son of a bitch! I'm goin' in after 'im!
- Give it to me, Loomis!

1261
01:38:34,741 --> 01:38:37,005
Oh, give it to me!

1262
01:38:47,087 --> 01:38:48,816
Ohh!

1263
01:38:50,957 --> 01:38:53,687
It's a Zero!

1264
01:38:56,463 --> 01:38:58,658
- I see him, I see him!
- Where?

1265
01:39:00,734 --> 01:39:03,703
Keep goin', keep goin'!
Come on! Keep goin'!

1266
01:39:03,770 --> 01:39:06,933
- I'm gonna hit the sign!
- Forget the sign. Keep goin'. Perfect.

1267
01:39:09,943 --> 01:39:13,140
- Oh, my God.
- I've never felt anything like that before.

1268
01:39:13,213 --> 01:39:15,147
You're damn right.

1269
01:39:15,215 --> 01:39:18,514
They think we're Japs!

1270
01:39:35,001 --> 01:39:36,935
What are you guys
shooting at?

1271
01:39:37,003 --> 01:39:39,437
I don't know.
Whatever they're shooting at!

1272
01:39:56,957 --> 01:39:59,391
Okay, let's go!

1273
01:39:59,459 --> 01:40:01,620
God, am I
in trouble now!

1274
01:40:06,233 --> 01:40:08,667
Aaaah!

1275
01:40:08,735 --> 01:40:11,727
I'm in trouble now!

1276
01:40:14,207 --> 01:40:16,641
Donna!

1277
01:40:16,710 --> 01:40:19,235
Oh, God, I'll be good!

1278
01:40:19,312 --> 01:40:21,246
Quit fooling around!

1279
01:40:22,883 --> 01:40:25,181
Donna! Level it off!

1280
01:40:30,157 --> 01:40:32,785
# The stars at night #

1281
01:40:32,859 --> 01:40:34,952
# Are big #

1282
01:40:35,028 --> 01:40:37,189
- # And bright ##
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1283
01:40:44,504 --> 01:40:47,871
Sarge, isn't it standard procedure
during an air raid to have a blackout?

1284
01:40:47,941 --> 01:40:52,378
- What are all these lights doin' on?
- Must be a foul-up somewhere.

1285
01:40:52,445 --> 01:40:55,380
We're gonna have to
knock 'em out ourselves.

1286
01:40:55,448 --> 01:40:57,382
Advance me 60 feet,
column left!

1287
01:40:57,450 --> 01:41:00,755
Take up a position!
I'm gonna douse these lights!

1288
01:41:00,888 --> 01:41:05,417
There's no place
like home.

1289
01:41:05,493 --> 01:41:08,428
Kid, you're the greatest
trick foot artist I ever seen,

1290
01:41:08,496 --> 01:41:11,431
and I seen 'em
all over the world.

1291
01:41:11,499 --> 01:41:14,434
- Just sign right here. Seven-year
contract. - Where's Betty?

1292
01:41:14,502 --> 01:41:16,595
- Where's Betty?
- She went out there.

1293
01:41:17,705 --> 01:41:19,764
Wait! Hey, wait!

1294
01:41:21,375 --> 01:41:24,105
Whoa!

1295
01:41:34,088 --> 01:41:38,047
Hey, you! You!
You with the stripes!

1296
01:41:39,126 --> 01:41:41,890
Be a pal and help me
pick up my ammo!

1297
01:41:41,963 --> 01:41:43,954
Yeah, all right!

1298
01:41:48,235 --> 01:41:50,169
Thanks a lot, buddy.

1299
01:41:51,272 --> 01:41:53,206
Okay, forward ho!

1300
01:41:53,274 --> 01:41:55,367
We're gonna draw trajectory
on Dumbo!

1301
01:42:03,484 --> 01:42:05,509
Look out!

1302
01:42:05,586 --> 01:42:07,679
Uhh! Tommies!

1303
01:42:07,755 --> 01:42:10,189
- Sarge?
- Tommies! The Tommies!

1304
01:42:10,257 --> 01:42:13,351
- Detroit is the arsenal of democracy!
- He got knocked on the head.

1305
01:42:13,427 --> 01:42:17,090
- He always did have a glass head.
- What are we gonna do?

1306
01:42:17,164 --> 01:42:19,860
You can't go out on me
now, Sarge!

1307
01:42:19,934 --> 01:42:23,870
I'll tell you what we're gonna do: go
home, paint the scratches on this tank,

1308
01:42:23,938 --> 01:42:26,839
put the sarge to bed
and forget this night ever happened!

1309
01:42:26,907 --> 01:42:28,898
I thought-

1310
01:42:28,976 --> 01:42:31,911
Knock out
those lights, kid.

1311
01:42:34,615 --> 01:42:37,049
He wants me to
knock out the lights.

1312
01:42:37,118 --> 01:42:40,554
See the mess on the streets?
I'm not gonna take the rap for this!

1313
01:42:40,621 --> 01:42:43,556
He's that tap-dancin'
fry boy from this morning.

1314
01:42:43,624 --> 01:42:47,560
- Yeah, I know, but he's wearin' the stripes.
- What'll it be, Sarge?

1315
01:42:49,330 --> 01:42:51,264
Right.

1316
01:42:51,332 --> 01:42:53,266
Let's knock out
these lights!

1317
01:42:58,272 --> 01:43:02,106
Ohh!

1318
01:43:13,854 --> 01:43:15,719
Take that, Tojo!
Take that!

1319
01:43:41,048 --> 01:43:43,516
This... is war.

1320
01:43:46,420 --> 01:43:48,854
Angelo, hurry!
My husband is crazy!

1321
01:43:48,923 --> 01:43:52,518
He says he sees Japanese
coming from the ocean!

1322
01:44:03,204 --> 01:44:06,173
Eat lead... slant.

1323
01:44:24,425 --> 01:44:28,327
- Has anyone in your command seen these Zeroes?
- No, but we're shooting at 'em.

1324
01:44:28,395 --> 01:44:31,831
Think about this: bombs!
I don't hear any bombs!

1325
01:44:31,899 --> 01:44:35,835
If they've come all the way from Asia,
don't you think they'd bring a few bombs?

1326
01:44:35,903 --> 01:44:40,067
- I don't know, sir, but- - But nothing!
You can't have an air raid without bombs!

1327
01:44:40,141 --> 01:44:41,904
Come on! Fly!

1328
01:44:41,976 --> 01:44:45,878
You can do it!

1329
01:44:52,453 --> 01:44:54,387
Donna, don't worry
about this!

1330
01:44:54,455 --> 01:44:58,915
I'm gonna set this baby down
if it's the last thing I do. Aaaaah!

1331
01:45:06,300 --> 01:45:09,565
Sayonara, sucker!

1332
01:45:11,639 --> 01:45:15,268
- Donna, are you okay?
- Where are we? Where's the door?

1333
01:45:18,846 --> 01:45:20,507
- Aaah!
- Ohh!

1334
01:45:23,584 --> 01:45:26,519
Aaah!

1335
01:45:26,587 --> 01:45:29,021
Eecch! Where are we?

1336
01:45:29,089 --> 01:45:33,082
What is this stuff?

1337
01:45:33,160 --> 01:45:36,596
Oh, my God,
are we in trouble now.

1338
01:45:40,768 --> 01:45:43,430
What are you shootin' at me for?

1339
01:45:43,504 --> 01:45:46,439
I'm an American!
Can't you tell the difference?

1340
01:45:46,507 --> 01:45:50,534
- Holy shit, I'd better get
my ass out over the ocean.

1341
01:46:15,991 --> 01:46:18,960
Hey, there's a Kraut
on board too.

1342
01:46:19,027 --> 01:46:21,655
We've got the whole
damn Axis here.

1343
01:46:21,730 --> 01:46:25,393
- Hey, what're we gonna do?
- Defend our homes, Angelo!

1344
01:46:25,467 --> 01:46:28,868
How do you expect
to do that, Ward?

1345
01:46:28,937 --> 01:46:32,373
The army gave me a gun.
I think it's high time we used it.

1346
01:46:32,441 --> 01:46:34,602
Yeah!

1347
01:46:34,676 --> 01:46:37,941
Hello? Hello?

1348
01:46:38,013 --> 01:46:41,847
Hello!
Scioli doesn't answer.

1349
01:46:48,857 --> 01:46:52,759
Aw, Jesus Christ, it's a sub!
Look, you guys, a Jap sub!

1350
01:46:55,330 --> 01:46:59,391
Holy shit, Herb!
The dummy's right.

1351
01:46:59,468 --> 01:47:02,835
Japs.
It's a full-scale invasion.

1352
01:47:02,905 --> 01:47:05,169
Gimme that phone!

1353
01:47:13,949 --> 01:47:16,941
Japs!

1354
01:47:26,395 --> 01:47:28,363
Coordinates,
1305-

1355
01:47:28,430 --> 01:47:30,694
I knew it,
I knew it, I knew it!

1356
01:47:30,766 --> 01:47:34,600
That's a Japanese Nakajima Type 97,
or I'm a bigger dummy than he is.

1357
01:47:58,026 --> 01:48:00,961
Oh, my God, I'm hit.
I'm hit!

1358
01:48:01,029 --> 01:48:03,497
Look at him burn!

1359
01:48:15,744 --> 01:48:18,770
Oh, my God.
It's a P-40 Tomahawk.

1360
01:48:18,847 --> 01:48:20,838
It's one of ours.

1361
01:48:20,916 --> 01:48:23,578
Mayday!

1362
01:48:28,123 --> 01:48:31,388
Mayday! Mayday!

1363
01:48:37,899 --> 01:48:40,925
- Hiya, doll.
- Oh, God! No!

1364
01:48:44,606 --> 01:48:47,131
Oh!

1365
01:48:47,209 --> 01:48:49,677
That's my kind of girl.

1366
01:48:49,745 --> 01:48:53,408
It's the end of the line, kid.
No more games.

1367
01:48:56,251 --> 01:48:59,345
Oh! God!

1368
01:49:05,427 --> 01:49:07,952
Put me down!

1369
01:49:15,504 --> 01:49:18,371
Wally!

1370
01:49:18,440 --> 01:49:20,965
- Wally!
- Betty.

1371
01:49:21,043 --> 01:49:25,912
- Let's get this heap turned
around now! Left! Now!

1372
01:49:25,981 --> 01:49:28,449
Wally!

1373
01:49:31,153 --> 01:49:34,088
Let's go!
Come on, let's move! Move!

1374
01:49:50,038 --> 01:49:53,098
I can't beat you
in a fair fight.

1375
01:49:53,175 --> 01:49:56,235
Stupid,
I don't fight fair.

1376
01:49:56,311 --> 01:49:58,472
Neither do I.

1377
01:49:59,748 --> 01:50:01,682
Aah! Oh! Gee!

1378
01:50:05,420 --> 01:50:08,014
Hiya, doll.

1379
01:50:08,090 --> 01:50:11,184
Follow that girl!

1380
01:50:26,808 --> 01:50:29,902
Give that back!

1381
01:50:29,978 --> 01:50:33,539
- No! No! No!
- Betty! Betty! Betty!

1382
01:50:33,615 --> 01:50:35,606
Wally?

1383
01:50:35,684 --> 01:50:37,879
Wally!

1384
01:51:13,655 --> 01:51:16,283
- Oh- -
My- - God!

1385
01:51:16,358 --> 01:51:19,623
Ohhhh!

1386
01:51:19,694 --> 01:51:21,753
Whoa-aah!

1387
01:51:42,751 --> 01:51:45,777
Huh? Hmm.

1388
01:51:46,855 --> 01:51:49,289
Okay, goddamn it!

1389
01:51:49,357 --> 01:51:51,348
Aah! Ohh! Hmm!

1390
01:51:54,229 --> 01:51:57,357
Okay, goddamn it!

1391
01:51:57,432 --> 01:52:01,766
- I think he's gonna jump.
- Geronimo! Aha!

1392
01:52:01,837 --> 01:52:05,398
Whoa! Ha-ha!

1393
01:52:05,473 --> 01:52:08,533
Made it! Ha-ha!

1394
01:52:08,610 --> 01:52:11,443
Huh? Oh.

1395
01:52:22,672 --> 01:52:27,975
I lost my plane.

1396
01:52:28,044 --> 01:52:31,878
My- Sub!
Jap sub!

1397
01:52:31,948 --> 01:52:34,178
Jap sub!

1398
01:52:34,250 --> 01:52:37,151
Hold on. We'll get you
outta here in a second.

1399
01:52:37,220 --> 01:52:39,916
Listen. Kid.
You gotta get that sub.

1400
01:52:39,989 --> 01:52:41,980
- What sub?
- The Jap sub.

1401
01:52:42,058 --> 01:52:44,856
- Where?
- In the ocean, lame-o.

1402
01:52:44,927 --> 01:52:47,361
Offshore near some
goddamn amusement park.

1403
01:52:47,430 --> 01:52:50,024
The Japs are at
Pacific Ocean Amusement Park?

1404
01:52:50,099 --> 01:52:52,158
That's next door
to my parents' house!

1405
01:52:52,235 --> 01:52:54,169
Kid!

1406
01:52:54,237 --> 01:52:57,172
You gotta sink that sub.

1407
01:52:57,240 --> 01:53:00,107
Come on, Sarge. Come on now!
Sarge, come on!

1408
01:53:00,176 --> 01:53:03,202
That's it, Sarge. We got a nice pad
for that head of yours.

1409
01:53:03,279 --> 01:53:05,611
That's it, Sarge.

1410
01:53:05,681 --> 01:53:09,378
We'll have a drink.

1411
01:53:12,922 --> 01:53:15,220
- Real Japs?
- Nah, wooden Japs, Cheetah!

1412
01:53:15,291 --> 01:53:17,350
What do you think?
Get me outta here!

1413
01:53:17,426 --> 01:53:19,690
Move it!
Move it!

1414
01:53:21,530 --> 01:53:23,657
What the hell is that?

1415
01:53:25,735 --> 01:53:28,101
It appears to be
an airplane, sir.

1416
01:53:28,170 --> 01:53:31,230
We tried to hold the block.
The plane broke through our perimeter.

1417
01:53:31,307 --> 01:53:33,741
Head down Hollywood Blvd.
to Highland!

1418
01:53:33,809 --> 01:53:36,835
Take Highland to Pico! Take Pico to-

1419
01:53:36,912 --> 01:53:40,006
# To your left
The camp is on your left #

1420
01:53:40,082 --> 01:53:42,642
# The camp is on to your left
The camp is on to your left #

1421
01:53:42,718 --> 01:53:45,118
- # Sound off Sound off #
- One, two!

1422
01:53:45,187 --> 01:53:48,384
Wait, Sarge! Wait for me, Sarge!
Please! Stop!

1423
01:53:50,459 --> 01:53:54,259
- What's that?
- It appears to be a large Negro, sir.

1424
01:53:56,866 --> 01:53:58,857
- What's that? -
Salesman. - A businessman.

1425
01:53:58,934 --> 01:54:00,868
- Accountant.
- A lawyer.

1426
01:54:00,936 --> 01:54:03,632
I'll grease your face
with those treads, you punk bastard!

1427
01:54:03,706 --> 01:54:05,867
- And that?
- A corporal.

1428
01:54:05,941 --> 01:54:09,308
Stretch!
I love you!

1429
01:54:13,949 --> 01:54:17,214
Soldier, are you
the pilot of that plane?

1430
01:54:19,021 --> 01:54:22,855
Yes, sir. Captain Wild Bill Kelso,
United States Army Air Corps.

1431
01:54:22,925 --> 01:54:25,519
I'm proud to report that
I'm the first American...

1432
01:54:25,594 --> 01:54:28,529
to shoot down a Jap plane
over the continental United States.

1433
01:54:28,597 --> 01:54:31,191
- You shot down a Jap plane?
- Yes, sir.

1434
01:54:31,267 --> 01:54:33,360
A Mitsubishi Zero, sir.

1435
01:54:33,436 --> 01:54:36,030
Got back some of that
scrap metal we sold 'em.

1436
01:54:36,105 --> 01:54:38,573
Blew the livin' hell outta him
right into the Stone Age.

1437
01:54:38,641 --> 01:54:41,667
We just got a report that a plane
went down in the La Brea Tar Pits.

1438
01:54:41,744 --> 01:54:44,542
That's him! That's gotta be the one!
I told you I shot him down.

1439
01:54:44,613 --> 01:54:46,877
- Is that a Jap plane?
- They don't know.

1440
01:54:46,949 --> 01:54:50,749
What do you mean they don't know?
Of course it was a Jap plane.

1441
01:54:50,820 --> 01:54:55,120
- You don't think I'd shoot down one of our own, do ya?
- I'm not so sure.

1442
01:54:55,191 --> 01:54:59,525
The plane's not important. What's
important is the submarine! The sub!

1443
01:54:59,595 --> 01:55:02,758
Submarine?
Shot down a Jap sub too.

1444
01:55:02,832 --> 01:55:05,300
No, sir.
I could have, though.

1445
01:55:05,368 --> 01:55:07,495
I had him in my sights.

1446
01:55:07,570 --> 01:55:10,368
I had that bastard
right where I wanted him.

1447
01:55:10,439 --> 01:55:14,808
But I caught it in the radiator.
He's still out there!

1448
01:55:14,877 --> 01:55:18,836
What about that plane?
There must be a pilot.

1449
01:55:20,116 --> 01:55:23,574
That is the craziest
son of a bitch I ever saw.

1450
01:55:25,254 --> 01:55:28,314
How many more like him
do you think are up there?

1451
01:55:29,959 --> 01:55:32,427
Get outta here!

1452
01:55:36,365 --> 01:55:38,731
Aw, look.
A baby wolf.

1453
01:55:38,801 --> 01:55:40,735
Where?

1454
01:55:53,015 --> 01:55:56,212
Gus, you can get into anything.
Open up this ammunition.

1455
01:55:56,285 --> 01:55:58,549
- Yes, sir.
- Stevie, round up the neighbors.

1456
01:55:58,621 --> 01:56:01,215
I'm going to need help getting this gun
over to where I can get a clear shot.

1457
01:56:01,290 --> 01:56:03,224
- Macey, stay close.
- Yes, sir!

1458
01:56:03,292 --> 01:56:05,556
That nice soldier told you
not to touch the ordnance.

1459
01:56:05,628 --> 01:56:07,789
Don't you think you should
call the army?

1460
01:56:07,863 --> 01:56:10,388
The army doesn't know
what they're doing. I can handle this.

1461
01:56:10,466 --> 01:56:14,869
- Ward, you're acting like Errol Flynn!
- Joan, damn it! Shut up!

1462
01:56:14,937 --> 01:56:16,962
Porca miseria!
I just remembered.

1463
01:56:17,039 --> 01:56:20,839
I got two guys stuck on top of the ferris
wheel. Somebody's gotta get 'em down.

1464
01:56:20,910 --> 01:56:24,175
Macey, get on your bike,
get over to the amusement pier.

1465
01:56:24,246 --> 01:56:27,579
- I gotta watch you sink the sub!
- That's an order, son.

1466
01:56:27,650 --> 01:56:31,586
- Yes, sir.
- Kid, this is the key to the control box in the ferris wheel.

1467
01:56:31,654 --> 01:56:34,919
- I know. I know, I know.
- Don't touch anything red or silver.

1468
01:56:34,990 --> 01:56:36,924
- Yeah, I know. I know.
- Only blue.

1469
01:56:36,992 --> 01:56:40,428
Okay, everybody, over here! Get on
this gun. We gotta move it over there!

1470
01:56:40,496 --> 01:56:42,430
We're sinking
a Japanese sub tonight.

1471
01:56:45,601 --> 01:56:50,432
# The camp is on
to your left #

1472
01:56:50,506 --> 01:56:52,940
Hey, Betty,
there's Officer Miller!

1473
01:56:53,008 --> 01:56:55,533
That's the flatfoot
who sent me up the river!

1474
01:56:55,611 --> 01:56:58,375
They're comin' up the beach right now.

1475
01:56:59,715 --> 01:57:02,582
Hey, Miller,
look at me!

1476
01:57:02,651 --> 01:57:04,983
Wally!

1477
01:57:05,054 --> 01:57:08,148
Hey, Miller, don't you know it's
a blackout? Turn out your lights!

1478
01:57:20,769 --> 01:57:24,535
- How'd you like that?
- I liked it just fine.

1479
01:57:26,742 --> 01:57:30,337
Are you sure you wanna
go through with this, Ward?

1480
01:57:32,281 --> 01:57:34,215
Okay. Okay.

1481
01:57:34,283 --> 01:57:37,218
Now, we do this.

1482
01:57:37,286 --> 01:57:40,949
Watch it!
Oh, whoa, oh, oh, oh!

1483
01:57:41,023 --> 01:57:43,150
Whoa! All right.

1484
01:57:46,262 --> 01:57:49,288
There! There.
Got him right in my sights.

1485
01:57:57,339 --> 01:57:59,739
I don't think
you're gonna hit him.

1486
01:58:13,155 --> 01:58:16,090
I can't believe it.
Why aren't they shooting back?

1487
01:58:16,158 --> 01:58:18,149
They can't see us,
that's why.

1488
01:58:41,951 --> 01:58:47,184
Do not... push a clip of ammunition
into the feed rollers here.

1489
01:58:53,067 --> 01:58:55,627
- Son of a-
- # And a steamboat #

1490
01:59:00,074 --> 01:59:02,838
- Oh, honey, I saw that movie.
Watch this.

1491
01:59:12,787 --> 01:59:16,245
Goin' my way, sister?

1492
01:59:16,324 --> 01:59:18,884
Son of a bitch
stole my tank.

1493
01:59:18,960 --> 01:59:23,954
First he gets egg on my uniform; then he
steals my girl; then he steals my tank.

1494
01:59:24,032 --> 01:59:27,297
- That's the tank I sent to get that sub.
- Yeah.

1495
01:59:27,368 --> 01:59:30,360
- Near some amusement park.
- Yeah, that's right.

1496
01:59:30,438 --> 01:59:34,340
- You know where it is?
- Yeah, sure.

1497
01:59:34,409 --> 01:59:36,809
Get in.

1498
01:59:38,179 --> 01:59:41,979
- Come on! Go! Go! Go, goddamn it!
- Let's go!

1499
01:59:48,322 --> 01:59:50,290
Turn right!
Turn right here!

1500
02:00:14,115 --> 02:00:16,379
I'm a bug!

1501
02:01:00,628 --> 02:01:04,189
You should never pull this
hand-operating lever to the rear.

1502
02:01:04,265 --> 02:01:06,324
Let's get outta here!

1503
02:01:06,400 --> 02:01:09,494
Do not restore the lever
to the firing position.

1504
02:01:09,570 --> 02:01:14,269
- Do not make sure that
this cover is completely closed.

1505
02:01:15,777 --> 02:01:18,371
Auf Wiedersehen. Sayonara.

1506
02:01:19,680 --> 02:01:22,478
Lots of luck.

1507
02:01:25,653 --> 02:01:28,247
And never ever,
under any circumstances,

1508
02:01:28,322 --> 02:01:31,223
should you disperse-

1509
02:01:31,292 --> 02:01:33,726
Never ever,
under any circumsta-

1510
02:01:35,263 --> 02:01:37,595
Oh!

1511
02:01:37,665 --> 02:01:40,031
Foot trigger!

1512
02:01:41,769 --> 02:01:44,465
Whoa-oh-oh!

1513
02:02:06,527 --> 02:02:10,156
I think about 150 to 200
dollars will fix that.

1514
02:02:12,400 --> 02:02:14,834
Did it get 'em?
Did it get 'em?

1515
02:02:14,902 --> 02:02:17,200
Close, Ward. Close.

1516
02:02:17,271 --> 02:02:20,763
Let's get this back out there.
I'll- I'll blast 'em again.

1517
02:02:21,876 --> 02:02:23,810
All right.

1518
02:02:42,430 --> 02:02:46,059
- # That's how people are #
- Great, we're lost! Where the hell is it?

1519
02:02:46,133 --> 02:02:48,693
- By the ocean.
- The ocean? That's left.

1520
02:02:48,769 --> 02:02:50,703
- No, straight. Right.
- Straight?

1521
02:02:50,771 --> 02:02:54,002
- Right or straight?
- I said straight, goddamn it!

1522
02:02:54,075 --> 02:02:56,703
- Sayonara, sucker.
- What are you doing?

1523
02:02:56,777 --> 02:02:59,940
# Never get together #

1524
02:03:04,118 --> 02:03:05,813
Geronimo!

1525
02:03:23,337 --> 02:03:27,330
Oh! Oh! Oh!

1526
02:03:27,408 --> 02:03:31,504
# Who's got the last laugh now #

1527
02:03:31,579 --> 02:03:34,139
Hey, quit rockin'
the car!

1528
02:03:34,215 --> 02:03:37,514
- Yeah, quit rockin' the car.
- Shut up! I wasn't rockin' it.

1529
02:03:37,585 --> 02:03:39,815
Hey!

1530
02:03:39,887 --> 02:03:45,456
- Hey, you guys! I'm supposed to get you down!
- Thank Christ!

1531
02:03:51,228 --> 02:03:54,925
It rolls easy once it gets started.
Just kiss it.

1532
02:03:54,999 --> 02:03:58,162
Don't worry, Ward. Gentle as a baby.

1533
02:04:04,441 --> 02:04:07,933
- There goes Dad!
- Watch out!

1534
02:04:10,748 --> 02:04:13,148
Open the door!

1535
02:04:16,020 --> 02:04:19,683
# I'll be home #

1536
02:04:19,757 --> 02:04:22,225
# For Chri- ##

1537
02:04:30,434 --> 02:04:32,561
- Dad!
- You're gonna wreck the whole house!

1538
02:04:32,636 --> 02:04:36,538
Boys, go to your room and don't
come down until I call you!

1539
02:04:36,607 --> 02:04:40,099
- You're ruining Christmas!
- Gliding it out!

1540
02:04:40,177 --> 02:04:42,805
Ooh!

1541
02:04:42,880 --> 02:04:45,974
- Too much.
- You wrecked the stairs!

1542
02:04:46,050 --> 02:04:50,180
- Which one do I pull?
- The one on the right. No, the one on the left.

1543
02:04:53,857 --> 02:04:56,223
Wait! W-Wait!
Wait! Wait! Ooh!

1544
02:04:57,528 --> 02:05:00,793
Coming back!

1545
02:05:08,205 --> 02:05:10,833
Now I've got 'em!

1546
02:05:10,908 --> 02:05:13,604
Ward Douglas,
don't you dare...

1547
02:05:13,677 --> 02:05:16,009
fire that gun
in this hou-

1548
02:05:26,757 --> 02:05:30,193
Whoa!

1549
02:05:33,997 --> 02:05:36,625
Boy, that was fun!

1550
02:05:40,738 --> 02:05:44,265
Whew! Wow!

1551
02:05:51,648 --> 02:05:53,775
"Warning! Do not...

1552
02:05:53,851 --> 02:05:55,682
turn on...

1553
02:05:55,753 --> 02:05:59,382
switch. "

1554
02:05:59,456 --> 02:06:01,651
Yeah!

1555
02:06:12,236 --> 02:06:15,967
Oh, my God! That's the wrong switch!

1556
02:06:19,643 --> 02:06:22,874
Turn off those lights,
you little asshole!

1557
02:06:36,593 --> 02:06:40,051
- Oh, my God.
- Trapped like beavers.

1558
02:07:05,923 --> 02:07:08,983
Hollywood.

1559
02:07:15,599 --> 02:07:18,090
Hollywood.

1560
02:07:39,256 --> 02:07:42,521
Give us this day our daily bread
and deliver us from evil.

1561
02:07:42,593 --> 02:07:45,528
And please don't let me go to
the same place he goes.

1562
02:07:49,700 --> 02:07:52,601
Oh, my God!

1563
02:07:59,309 --> 02:08:03,211
I can't stop it!

1564
02:08:27,070 --> 02:08:28,594
Ma!

1565
02:09:37,174 --> 02:09:40,041
Banzai! Banzai!

1566
02:09:40,110 --> 02:09:42,670
- Good-bye, Hollywood!
- Banzai!

1567
02:09:54,424 --> 02:09:58,360
Hey, are you okay?
You all right?

1568
02:10:00,831 --> 02:10:03,095
Boy, that was fun.
Can we do it again?

1569
02:10:03,166 --> 02:10:05,259
- You wanna do it again?
- I wanna do it again.

1570
02:10:05,335 --> 02:10:09,008
You really wanna do it again?

1571
02:10:19,385 --> 02:10:22,183
I blew the exhaust manifold!

1572
02:10:27,993 --> 02:10:31,360
- There's the ocean! Hang a right!
- Who cares about the ocean?

1573
02:10:53,352 --> 02:10:55,786
Get it off me!

1574
02:10:55,855 --> 02:11:00,189
- Hey, hey, hey!
Get in the back of the tank.

1575
02:11:09,301 --> 02:11:11,735
Wait for me.

1576
02:11:15,307 --> 02:11:17,241
- Betty!
- Macey!

1577
02:11:17,309 --> 02:11:19,243
- How's Mom and Dad?
- They're fine.

1578
02:11:21,180 --> 02:11:24,115
- Who knows how to load this gun?
- He does.

1579
02:11:31,957 --> 02:11:34,926
Banzai!

1580
02:11:47,006 --> 02:11:50,806
Give me that! Give me that! Give me
that! Give me that! Give me that!

1581
02:11:53,279 --> 02:11:56,715
- What's that?
- Uh, here, hold this.

1582
02:11:59,251 --> 02:12:01,651
Now, Sarge,

1583
02:12:01,720 --> 02:12:04,154
what is the loading
and firing procedure...

1584
02:12:04,223 --> 02:12:06,748
for the 75-millimeter
cannon?

1585
02:12:06,825 --> 02:12:09,259
- There are five basic components...
- This is it.

1586
02:12:09,328 --> 02:12:11,762
to the new General Motors
electric refrigerator.

1587
02:12:11,830 --> 02:12:13,923
- One, a freon compressor;
- What?

1588
02:12:13,999 --> 02:12:17,992
- two, the freon tube; three, the power
transformer- - No, no. Sarge. No, Sarge.

1589
02:12:39,591 --> 02:12:42,822
Geronimo!

1590
02:13:02,047 --> 02:13:05,346
Whoa! It's turning!
Look, it's pointing this way!

1591
02:13:14,893 --> 02:13:17,987
- Torpedo!
- Torpedo!

1592
02:13:38,384 --> 02:13:40,944
Blackout! Blackout!
Douse those street lights!

1593
02:13:43,522 --> 02:13:46,320
Kill that
theater marquee!

1594
02:14:21,093 --> 02:14:24,187
I made it!
It's me, you yellow bastards!

1595
02:14:26,565 --> 02:14:30,899
Come on! It's me,
Wild Bill Kelso!

1596
02:14:38,844 --> 02:14:41,870
I know you're in there,
you yellow-bellied zipperheads!

1597
02:14:49,555 --> 02:14:53,218
Wally, did we get 'em?

1598
02:14:53,292 --> 02:14:56,386
I think so.
She's going down.

1599
02:14:59,331 --> 02:15:02,562
All right! Hey!
Where are ya?

1600
02:15:04,303 --> 02:15:08,239
Oh, Geronimo!

1601
02:15:10,843 --> 02:15:14,370
All right!
My name is Wild Bill Kelso.

1602
02:15:14,446 --> 02:15:16,971
And don't you... shoot.

1603
02:15:19,017 --> 02:15:21,451
All right,
turn this tub around.

1604
02:15:21,520 --> 02:15:24,011
You're taking me to Tokyo.

1605
02:15:25,824 --> 02:15:27,917
Anybody got a light?

1606
02:15:42,074 --> 02:15:44,736
...out of a brilliant blue western sky,

1607
02:15:44,810 --> 02:15:47,973
- foreign aircraft, flying both
in large formation and singly,

1608
02:15:48,046 --> 02:15:50,378
flew over Southern California
last night...

1609
02:15:50,449 --> 02:15:52,917
- and drew heavy barrages
of antiaircraft fire-

1610
02:15:52,985 --> 02:15:58,082
the first ever to sound over United States
continental soil against an enemy invader.

1611
02:15:58,157 --> 02:16:00,955
No bombs
were reported dropped.

1612
02:16:01,026 --> 02:16:03,722
Shortly before 10:00 p. m.,
police reported...

1613
02:16:03,795 --> 02:16:07,060
that an airplane had been shot down
into the La Brea Tar Pits.

1614
02:16:07,132 --> 02:16:09,225
In other parts of the city,

1615
02:16:09,301 --> 02:16:12,134
Fifth Column acts were
reported during the air raid.

1616
02:16:12,204 --> 02:16:15,435
- Mysterious lights were spotted
in many locales.

1617
02:16:15,507 --> 02:16:17,873
In the Tarzana hills,
Burbank police...

1618
02:16:17,943 --> 02:16:20,571
saw a string of lights
in a "V" form,

1619
02:16:20,646 --> 02:16:23,080
pointing toward
the Lockheed Aircraft plant.

1620
02:16:23,148 --> 02:16:25,878
All right, fall in
the yard! Fall in the yard, men!

1621
02:16:25,951 --> 02:16:29,819
Foley, Jones,
Reese, Hinshaw! Ten-hut!

1622
02:16:31,490 --> 02:16:33,924
...and immediately Army
searchlights shot into the sky.

1623
02:16:33,992 --> 02:16:35,926
Sergeant,
what happened here?

1624
02:16:35,994 --> 02:16:39,623
Sir, while suppressing a riot on
Hollywood Blvd. last night with our tank,

1625
02:16:39,698 --> 02:16:42,132
I... was, uh,
struck unconscious.

1626
02:16:42,201 --> 02:16:44,635
My men, however, received a report
about a Japanese sub...

1627
02:16:44,703 --> 02:16:47,194
off the Santa Monica Pier
from a downed Army Air Corps captain.

1628
02:16:47,272 --> 02:16:49,832
They responded immediately, went to the
objective and at about 2300 hours...

1629
02:16:49,908 --> 02:16:52,308
- they engaged the enemy.
- Damage?

1630
02:16:52,377 --> 02:16:56,609
Uh, the Japanese sunk both our tank
and, uh, the ferris wheel, sir.

1631
02:16:56,682 --> 02:16:59,583
I think we hit the sub.
I saw it go down!

1632
02:16:59,651 --> 02:17:02,279
You see, sir, I-

1633
02:17:02,354 --> 02:17:05,448
Donna! Donna! Donna! Not now!

1634
02:17:05,524 --> 02:17:08,322
Oh, honey.

1635
02:17:08,393 --> 02:17:12,659
- My girlfriend was there- There was
this wild man- - Is this a long story?

1636
02:17:12,731 --> 02:17:14,665
- Yes, sir.
- Then save it.

1637
02:17:14,733 --> 02:17:17,327
Sir, I'd like
to say something.

1638
02:17:25,811 --> 02:17:28,541
We've been through a lot,
all of us.

1639
02:17:28,614 --> 02:17:31,708
We faced the enemy
for the first time last night,

1640
02:17:31,783 --> 02:17:33,944
right in
our own backyards,

1641
02:17:34,019 --> 02:17:36,112
and we came together,

1642
02:17:36,188 --> 02:17:40,955
put our differences aside and carried
on the true spirit of America.

1643
02:17:41,026 --> 02:17:45,395
I think no matter what happens,
what sacrifices we have to face,

1644
02:17:45,464 --> 02:17:48,956
we can carry forward
like Americans.

1645
02:17:50,902 --> 02:17:54,896
While we're doing our repairs, I'm going
to hang this wreath on my front door.

1646
02:17:56,731 --> 02:17:59,461
This symbol of Christmas,

1647
02:17:59,534 --> 02:18:01,525
this symbol of peace.

1648
02:18:01,602 --> 02:18:04,935
I just want to remind us all
that we're not going to let...

1649
02:18:05,006 --> 02:18:08,237
a bunch of treacherous
enemy killjoys...

1650
02:18:09,343 --> 02:18:11,675
ruin our Christmas.

1651
02:18:33,534 --> 02:18:36,002
Boy, that's great!

1652
02:18:39,107 --> 02:18:41,769
What?

1653
02:18:51,319 --> 02:18:54,516
- You're gonna need tanks
for the Burma road, sir.

1654
02:18:54,589 --> 02:18:57,183
I'm just a sergeant,
but I'm a great mechanic.

1655
02:18:57,258 --> 02:19:00,284
You know, this year wasn't the
big year of the war, '41.

1656
02:19:00,361 --> 02:19:03,626
I think the really big year
is going to be 1942.

1657
02:19:03,698 --> 02:19:07,190
Let go of me!

1658
02:19:09,837 --> 02:19:12,738
It's gonna be a long war.

1659
02:19:15,543 --> 02:19:18,376
Let me go! Let me go!

1660
02:19:53,436 --> 02:19:56,030
Oh! Open the door!

1661
02:19:56,105 --> 02:19:59,199
Whoa-ohhh!

1662
02:20:14,457 --> 02:20:18,860
That is the craziest
son of a bitch I ever saw.

1663
02:20:27,236 --> 02:20:29,534
Torpedo!

1664
02:20:32,108 --> 02:20:35,373
It was on
that radio there!

1665
02:20:35,445 --> 02:20:38,039
Ohhhh!

1666
02:20:38,114 --> 02:20:41,208
Jesus Christ, it's a sub!
Look, you guys, a Jap sub!

1667
02:20:41,284 --> 02:20:44,082
I can't beat you
in a fair fight.

1668
02:20:48,825 --> 02:20:51,385
Back! Back!

1669
02:20:51,461 --> 02:20:53,622
They're rioting
in the street, sir.

1670
02:20:53,696 --> 02:20:56,597
Whoa-aah!

1671
02:20:56,666 --> 02:20:59,157
Let's get outta here!

1672
02:21:01,804 --> 02:21:04,637
Hi, Stretch!

1673
02:21:04,707 --> 02:21:07,107
Close, Ward. Close.

1674
02:21:07,176 --> 02:21:09,838
That reminds me. Kill them cockroaches
in that flour sack.

1675
02:21:09,912 --> 02:21:13,245
Look at that!

1676
02:21:13,316 --> 02:21:15,511
There goes Dad!

1677
02:21:15,585 --> 02:21:18,420
Kill a few Krauts
for me, huh?
