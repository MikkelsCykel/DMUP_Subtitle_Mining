00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,520
June 21st.

5
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,800
Exile to Siberia.

6
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,360
I mean, New Jersey.

7
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,320
Is there a difference?

8
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:43,280
I can't tell.

9
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,720
Isn't Siberia the place
they send you to die?

10
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,640
And from my experience

11
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,880
Ocean Grove isn't that much different.

12
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,080
I think the median age is 85

13
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:57,760
with the life expectancy of 86.

14
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,160
Sounds about right to me.

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,320
Thanks, Mom.

16
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,960
Thank you for buying me
a one-way ticket to hell.

17
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,600
I mean,
Grams' and Gramps' mausoleum.

18
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,240
where it always smells like
desiccated socks.

19
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,120
Oh, I'm sure they're thrilled too.

20
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:20,360
It'll just be one great summer
of Chinese torture for all of us.

21
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,920
Who cares anyway?

22
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,880
Nobody.

23
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,960
Actually, maybe Ocean Grove
is the perfect place for me.

24
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,240
In fact, when I get off this bus

25
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,920
I should just walk over to the pier
and jump,

26
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,280
end it all.

27
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:39,040
Goodbye, world.
Goodbye, New Jersey.

28
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,200
The truth is, if I weren't around,

29
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,840
it would solve everyone's problems.

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,760
Mom could really focus
on saving marriage number nine.

31
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,720
And my grandmother-

32
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,280
well, she could spend
her whole summer

33
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,920
making those seashell
thingies she makes.

34
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,880
And Gramps could finally finish

35
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,680
fixing up that boat of his.

36
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,200
Yeah, Grams definitely wouldn't care
if I weren't around.

37
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,400
I swear she has some serious
anxiety issues.

38
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,080
Maybe I should give her
some of my pills.

39
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,080
That's what I should do-

40
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,160
make it easy on everyone.

41
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,320
If I weren't here,
their lives would be better.

42
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:18,360
There's only one person
who might actually care,

43
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:21,480
but Dad isn't around anymore.

44
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,880
Buses suck, huh?

45
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,240
Great. Hello, New Jersey!

46
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,400
Good times, good times.

47
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,240
Hi, sweetie.

48
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,880
Greta, how nice to see you.

49
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:30,640
Gramps, Grams, hi.

50
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,600
You folks don't look so bad,

51
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,200
all things considered.

52
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,120
Hello to you too, Greta.

53
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,640
Yeah, hello hello.

54
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,560
We all know why I'm here.
No need to act thrilled about it.

55
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,480
We're glad to have you here, honey.
We really are.

56
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:09,680
Yeah, well, I didn't really plan
on spending my summer in Jersey,

57
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,520
in what might as well be
a nursing home.

58
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,160
Gramps: Well, I guess you're glad
to be out of school for the summer, right?

59
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,560
If I cared one microbe
about schooI,

60
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:25,400
I guess yeah, it'd be some kind
of a relief.

61
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,760
Your mother said
you were on the honor roll all year.

62
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,320
That's terrific.

63
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,320
You should be proud of yourself.
You'll get into a good college.

64
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,480
I'm not going to college.

65
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,520
Of course you're going
to college.

66
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,680
The fact is that I'm gonna kill myself
before I turn 18,

67
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,560
so that doesn't really leave much time
for an undergraduate degree.

68
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,880
I assume that you understand

69
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,080
that a joke is supposed
to be funny.

70
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,520
It's not a joke.

71
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:53,760
See, I've been making this list
of all the different ways you can die-

72
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,520
self-immolation,

73
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,080
falling from a great height.

74
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,280
I don't know about electrocution.

75
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,520
I hear that your heart actually cooks
and you puke up your melted guts.

76
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:05,600
All right, Greta, just stop.
Just stop right now.

77
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,840
Well, at the same time,
I've been making this list

78
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,640
of things that I want to do
before I die.

79
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,960
For instance,
I want to eat a bug

80
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,840
just to say that I did.

81
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,440
I want to get in a fistfight
with a grown man.

82
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,720
Don't ask.

83
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,960
I want to learn
how to really paint,

84
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,400
and maybe get a tattoo.

85
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,080
Anyway, as soon as I choose
my method of death

86
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,600
then I'm gonna cross as much off
my to-do list as I can

87
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:33,200
and commit some kind of
grizzly suicide.

88
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,680
Voilá.

89
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,400
You won't have Greta
to kick around anymore.

90
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,720
Come on, Greta.

91
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,960
Well, look who it is.

92
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,480
You certainly have grown up
to be quite the pretty young lady

93
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,320
under all that makeup.

94
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:09,480
Mrs. Wocheski,
same nosy old bag.

95
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,480
What? What's that?

96
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,400
I said, "Isn't this heat a drag?"

97
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,600
A drag?

98
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,840
Hey, did you hear about
that huge hunk of space junk

99
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,120
that landed in some
old lady's home

100
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,240
just about a month ago
right here in Jersey?

101
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,400
Jersey?

102
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,160
The universe is just
loaded with things that we've left up there.

103
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,760
- What?
- And all of a sudden-

104
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,280
- Bam!
- Whaa!

105
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,760

Parnelli.

116
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,280
Hey.

117
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,920
What's it like living with the mummies
of Guanajuato?

118
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,440
Do you ever get used
to that smell?

119
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,800
Hmm?

120
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,680
You don't care,

121
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,320
as long as someone feeds you
and scoops your litter.

122
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:56,760
It's a pretty good deal,
a life you want anyway.

123
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,800
Katherine: I'm trying not to be
judgmental, Joseph,

124
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,080
but she's a handful.

125
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,560
Joseph: Oh, Katherine,
it's only three months.

126
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,680
September will be here
before you know it.

127
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,960
You don't think
she's serious, do you?

128
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,760
No, I think she's just
being dramatic,

129
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:22,480
trying to push our buttons.

130
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,640
Yeah, you know who she
reminds me of at that age?

131
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,160
Karen.

132
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:29,840
Ow. I'm nothing like my mother!

133
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,040
Nothing!

134
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,880
Hey, Gramps,
can I bump a $20?

135
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,920
Mm!

136
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,360
Greta, we have rules
in this house.

137
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:54,040
I assume your mother
told you about them.

138
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,640
Yeah.

139
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,640
I'm sure she did.

140
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,760
I'm also sure
I wasn't paying attention.

141
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,920
Oh, well,

142
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,000
then listen to me.

143
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,760
Now you can have
a very nice summer here,

144
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:12,280
but it won't be
without structure and supervision.

145
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,040
Now if you want to have
spending money,

146
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,520
you're going to have to
get a job.

147
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,280
And there will be
a 10:00 PM curfew.

148
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:26,000
And you're not permitted
beyond the town lines,

149
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,240
especially not to Asbury Park.
That's no place for you.

150
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:34,120
So does all of that
sound fair to you?

151
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,720
Let me tell you how this works:

152
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:46,280
I go where I want
when I want with whom I want.

153
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,800
And I don't come home
untiI I want to.

154
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,760
Now that's how it works
at Karen's.

155
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:54,120
So if you've got a problem with it,
take it up with her.

156
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,920
She's the one who dumped me
on you two anyway.

157
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,840
Okay? Let's just do each other
a favor,

158
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,760
stay out of each other's way.

159
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,840
Summer will be over
before we know it.

160
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,240
Deal?

161
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,640
Deal.

162
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,040
Where did you get that?

163
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,720
Oh, yeah.

164
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,640
What does that thing get,

165
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,600
90 yards to a gallon?

166
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,680
Only on a steep downgrade.

167
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,240
Can I borrow it?

168
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:49,280
Huh-uh. I heard about what happened
when you went to get your driver's license.

169
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,280
That DMV guy
was emotionally unstable, okay?

170
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,640
It was not my driving
that made him cry.

171
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,240
I'm serious.

172
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,280
Okay, we'll see
what your mother thinks.

173
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,040
Like she thinks.

174
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,600
I swear she holds the record
for the most blah moments.

175
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,880
She thinks that string theory
has something to do with macramé.

176
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:11,160
This is the same woman
that gives me advice on boys.

177
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:14,360
Her husbands are in and out so fast,
I can't even keep track.

178
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,320
What, is this
husband number nine?

179
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,080
Three.

180
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,240
And you can't drive alone
without a license.

181
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,280
It's against the law.

182
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,560
What's the worst
that's gonna happen, Grams?

183
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,840
I die?

184
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,560
No, the worst thing
that can happen

185
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,560
is that you take somebody
with you when you die.

186
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,960
Greta: Ocean Grove.

187
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,200
More like Ocean Grave.

188
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,760
No wonder Mom left this place
when she was 17.

189
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,160
It's so passé.

190
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,040
I'll make her pay for this torture
when I get home.

191
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,840
That is, if I make it home.

192
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:06,120
Wow. Okay, I'll give it to her-

193
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,960
Grams looked pretty.

194
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:24,920
Can I help you?

195
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:28,000
There's something majorly wrong
with the cable.

196
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,920
I think you ought to call
and light a fire under someone's ass.

197
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,480
We don't have cable.

198
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,400
Wait, say that again.

199
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,920
I said we don't-

200
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:39,080
What are you wear-?
Oh, look at you.

201
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,400
How do you survive
without cable?

202
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,200
It's really tough, Greta.

203
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,400
Sometimes we cry ourselves
to sleep at night.

204
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:51,040
You know, you can always
rent videotapes.

205
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,320
Videotapes?

206
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:56,840
Come on, who lives like this?

207
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,440
Oh, stop the histrionics, Greta,
for goodness' sakes.

208
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,160
There's so much to do
around here.

209
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,080
There's the whole ocean
right there.

210
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,600
Take my bicycle.
Ride along the boardwalk.

211
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,840
Then you won't have time
for TV.

212
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,400
So you want me to sacrifice
reality TV

213
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,800
for purely empirical
experiences?

214
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,040
Yeah, that's my
recommendation.

215
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,400
Fine.

Greta: They say that drowning
and freezing to death

241
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,240
are the nicest ways to die,
euphoric even.

242
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,240
I wonder how they would
know that.

243
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:17,440
The way I see it, what does
experience have to do with anything?

244
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,680
I mean, I've been served
by 1000 waitresses

245
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,640
and the job just doesn't
seem that tough.

246
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,400
I'm sure it has its nuances
just like anything else,

247
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,840
but I'll figure it out.

248
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,640
You're soaking wet.

249
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,280
Oh, come on, Lou.

250
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,840
I'd say the wet T-shirt look
definitely trumps experience.

251
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,640
Does he have
all of his shots?

252
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,240
Let me get you an application.

253
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,880
What the hell for?
It's a yes or no decision.

254
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,640
Not really. It's-

255
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,760
Hey, Lou, give her the job.
You're gonna give it to her anyway.

256
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,000
Zip it, Julie.

257
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,880
See, this is how it works-

258
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,120
you ask him something;
he pretends to chew on it.

259
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:54,840
He can't say no to nobody,
so you got the job. Don't worry about it.

260
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,160
I don't need your help.

261
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,520
I ain't trying to help you.
Hell, I don't even know you.

262
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:01,480
I'm trying to help my boy.
One more night that he's shorthanded-

263
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:04,400
he's gonna develop an ulcer
and it's gonna be problematic for all of us.

264
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:07,040
Get back to the dungeon.

265
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,320
I'm just saying, man.
I'm just saying.

266
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:12,160
I can start tomorrow.
Would you like me here at 4:00?

267
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,280
Um...

268
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,840
Or how about lunch?

269
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,280
Then I can learn everything.
It'll be all good.

270
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,400
Uh...

271
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,520
Great. See you then.

272
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,400
Hey, that girl's trouble.

273
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:28,240
I think I just hired her.

274
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:34,640
Oh my God, you guys
are still awake?

275
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:37,680
You do realize
it's past 9:00, right?

276
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,480
You realize
that you missed dinner?

277
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,680
What happened to my dress?

278
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:45,000
Oh, I went swimming.

279
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:48,000
New York doesn't use that ocean
as a toilet, do they?

280
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,120
Is my hair starting
to turn green?

281
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:53,040
Greta, I really don't mind
you wearing my dress.

282
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,320
I do mind you going swimming in it.
Would you take it off, please?

283
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,040
Greta, your mother called.

284
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,720
You were supposed to let her know
you got down here all right.

285
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,160
Well, did you tell her
that I was still alive?

286
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,920
Why don't you tell her?
There's a phone on the piano.

287
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,200
- Are you taking that?
- Yes, I am.

288
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,880
- You're in deep trouble now.
- Come on.

289
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,080
- Gin.
- Oh, no.

290
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,840
It's me.
What do you want?

291
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,240
Karen: I see you survived
the bus trip after all.

292
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,920
I'd rather have ferried
across the River Styx.

293
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,720
Grams told me about your little
to-die list.

294
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,800
You shouldn't scare her
like that.

295
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:28,680
She doesn't know you well enough
to understand.

296
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:31,280
How's my old room look?

297
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,400
Does she still have
her seashells everywhere?

298
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:36,000
It's a shell hole, Mom.

299
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,800
Why are you doing this to me?

300
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,280
Karen: You know why.
We've discussed this.

301
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,720
I am trying
to save my marriage.

302
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,440
You would have better luck

303
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,280
trying to save
the polar ice caps, Mom.

304
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,400
Why is it that your marriage only works
when I'm not there?

305
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:56,440
Sweetie,

306
00:18:56,600 --> 00:19:00,200
Greta, I know this is tough,
but try to make the best of it.

307
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,160
Take as much time
as you need, okay, Karen?

308
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:12,240
Sort things out,
shuffle them together,

309
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,200
do whatever the hell it is
you need to do

310
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,000
to try and save
this marriage, okay?

311
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,720
I'm here and I'm fine.
Don't even worry about me.

312
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,280
I'm fine!

Greta: If Dad were alive,

318
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,200
he'd let me drive the car.

319
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,640
And we'd do stuff like paint.

320
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,600
Maybe I'd be friends
with the kid down the street.

321
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:51,360
Mom and he would argue
about petunias instead of money.

322
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,400
If Dad were alive,

323
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,680
he'd teach me
how to play the guitar.

324
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:00,240
If Dad were alive.
If Dad were alive.

00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,240
No, I ordered the High Tide.

338
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,200
The Red Squall is mine.

339
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,960
You expect me to remember
what you ordered?

340
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,040
Figure it out yourselves.

341
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,600
You guys have had plenty of time
to look over this lousy menu.

342
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,920
So what's it gonna be?

343
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,640
Is everybody ready?

344
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,960
- No.
- I think we need another minute.

345
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,200
If I walk away from this table
without an order,

346
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,120
I'm not coming back
for another 20 minutes.

347
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,000
I hope by then
you've got it figured out.

348
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,560
I know what I want.

349
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,000
Yeah? Well, I see
who the decision-maker is here.

350
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,680
What will it be?

351
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,600
I will have the chicken breast.

352
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,440
What the hell is wrong with you?

353
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:50,200
You come to a seafood restaurant
and order chicken?

354
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:51,680
Well, the other stuff
is expensive.

355
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,760
That's because it tastes good.

356
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,520
Come on, Stacy,
order the lobster.

357
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:59,120
You can even pick it out
if you're feeling particularly sadistic.

358
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,360
Do you like shrimp?

359
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,120
We have a spectacular
shrimp cocktail,

360
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:07,360
if you don't mind ripping apart
their freaky exoskeletons.

361
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,920
They have a lot of cholesterol,
don't they?

362
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,600
Not half as much
as the lobster.

363
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,560
Oh my God.

364
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,760
Listen, you could die
on a car ride home tonight,

365
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:18,040
and you're worried
about a little bypass surgery

366
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,200
20 years down the road?
Relax.

367
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:22,880
You're gonna get the shrimp cocktail
and the poached lobster.

368
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,040
Who's next?

369
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,600
Not bad for a kid
learning the ropes.

370
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:33,000
Welcome aboard, Greta.

371
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,680
Thanks.

372
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:37,680
Hey, that seafaring lingo
that you do-

373
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,880
you don't do that
all the time, right?

374
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:42,960
Yeah, I want to see a collar
from now on.

375
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,280
This is a respectable place.

376
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,440
Aye aye, Captain.

377
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,720
Oh my God.

378
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:55,040
Hey, you got a car?

379
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,920
Seeing as I don't have a license, no.

380
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:01,240
Yeah, well,

381
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,240
why don't you stick around
a little while?

382
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,920
And I will get you home safely.

383
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,880
Uh, thanks, Voltaire,

384
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,920
but I can take care of myself
all right?

385
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,760
Anyway, I'm only 17.

386
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:17,440
What, are you, like, 40?

387
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,520
Hey, Lou,

388
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,960
what's a Voltaire?

389
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,880
Does Lou know that you're
feeding his food to the strays?

390
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,000
It's just garbage.

391
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:39,320
Lou know that you think
his food is garbage?

392
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,400
No, I mean it's going
in the garbage.

393
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:43,560
It's just a joke.

394
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,800
Hold on.

395
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,640
My name's Julie.

396
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,280
I'm Greta,

397
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:55,680
which is just a thinly disguised
anagram for "great. "

398
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,720
Okay.

399
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,520
You didn't thank me
for getting you hired.

400
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:02,040
That's 'cause I already
hate the job.

401
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,480
It's only been one day.

402
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,040
What's up, little girl?

403
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:05,680
- Man: Check this out.
- Man #2: Yeah, look at that.

404
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,480
Hey, slice, like at you.

405
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,600
Baby, can I walk with you?

406
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:11,880
No.

407
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:14,160
Oh, she cold.

408
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,600
Yeah, that's right.

409
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,000
Woman: What are you
looking at?

410
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,800
Man: What did I say?
What did I just say?

411
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,200
Woman: I'm not giving it to you
no matter what.

412
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,200
Parnelli.

413
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,680
Where are you?

414
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,640
Parnelli, time to come in.

415
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,880
Parnelli.

416
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:16,760
Thanks for the ride.

417
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:19,040
- Stay out of trouble, sweetheart.
- Yeah.

418
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,560
Grams, don't worry.

419
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:24,920
They're trumped up charges.
Jury's got nothing on me.

420
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,200
What?

421
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,920
We found her over
in Asbury Park.

422
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,960
She got a little scared,
so we brought her home.

423
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:34,120
Oh.

424
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,720
Oh, thank you.

425
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,000
What happened?

426
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:57,600
Come right in, Grams.
Don't bother waiting for an invitation.

427
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,560
Now you see why I told you

428
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,840
to stay away
from Asbury Park.

429
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,120
Well, you piqued
my curiosity, okay?

430
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:07,360
Oh, I see.
It was all my fault.

431
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,320
If you don't want me
to do something,

432
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:12,280
don't plant the idea
in my head.

433
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,800
I'm just trying
to protect you.

434
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,600
It's a little late.

435
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,560
I'm really tired, Grams.

436
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:31,480
Good night.

437
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:37,000
Well, I admit
she's a bit of a challenge, but-

438
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,200
What?

439
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:40,800
A challenge.
I say she's a challenge.

440
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,840
A challenge?
She's a pain in the butt.

441
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,840
Good morning.

442
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,280
Oh, love,

443
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:53,560
it seems Greta is giving
Mrs. Wocheski some difficulty.

444
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:56,000
There's no "seems" about it.
She is.

445
00:27:56,160 --> 00:28:00,200
She said Mr. Poodles
was just a mangy rodent

446
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:03,360
and not a real dog at all.

447
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,520
And then she said
he looks just like me.

448
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,360
Are you sure you heard her
correctly?

449
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,480
What?

450
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,000
I said I'm sure she meant it
in the sweetest possible way.

451
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:14,000
Oh, she's a menace,
that girI.

452
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,640
You'd better keep
a sharp eye out.

453
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,920
Well, we'll see to it
that she apologizes.

454
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:21,880
Won't we, dear?

455
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,000
Are you done?

456
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,240
I wish.

457
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,440
- Well, how much longer?
- Just a bit.

458
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,760
Excuse me, is that
your van outside?

459
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:31,080
Yes, ma'am.
I'm hooking it up right now.

460
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:33,600
Well, I didn't order any hooking up,
so you just go ahead

461
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,720
and unhook
whatever it is you hooked.

462
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,200
Grams, I'm paying for this.

463
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,520
That's not the point.

464
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:42,360
You're gonna love this, okay?

465
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,000
I don't want cable.

466
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,680
Look, I'm almost done here,
so if you don't want this-

467
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:50,440
Grams, it's guaranteed to keep me
out of trouble the whole summer.

468
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:53,120
And it's not costing you
a thing.

469
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,000
We've got to send her home.

470
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,080
I can't do it.
I just can't take it anymore.

471
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,760
Oh, honey, so she wants
the cable TV.

472
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,720
What's the harm in that?

473
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:08,000
Katherine: That's the point.
She does whatever she wants to do.

474
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,600
She has no boundaries.

475
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,440
Karen's always been
too permissive with her.

476
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,720
Okay, that'll do it.

477
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,920
Finally.

478
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,560
This here is your remote.
What you do is-

479
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,880
Yeah, I got it, okay?
Scram.

480
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:22,720
All right, just-

481
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,080
I just need a signature here.

482
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:27,280
Ma'am?

483
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,360
Sir?

484
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:35,600
- I just need a signature.
- Okay, I got it.

485
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:41,000
- Hey.
- I told Mrs. Wocheski

486
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:43,920
that you would apologize
for that smart-alecky remark

487
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,120
you made about her dog.

488
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,880
Now please go do it.

489
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:49,560
I can't believe you would
sell out your own granddaughter

490
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:50,880
to that old blue-hair.

491
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,800
It's not even blue
in a good way.

492
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,240
Go.

493
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,120
Now.

494
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,160
We thought we heard
someone at the door.

495
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:20,320
You ratted me out
to my grandparents.

496
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,240
I most certainly did.

497
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,920
And I believe you owe me
an apology.

498
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:28,640
You know,

499
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:31,200
I noticed you keep those windows
pretty much open all the time.

500
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,760
Of course I do.
The breeze is healthy.

501
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,240
Yeah?

502
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,200
What time do you go to bed
around usually,

503
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,440
7:30, 8:00-ish?

504
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:40,840
What are you getting at?

505
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,440
You don't scare me.

506
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,560
Mm-hmm.

507
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,080
You don't scare me.

508
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,160
Give me just one second here.

509
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,280
Uh, okay.

510
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,120
How's the perch?

511
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:21,800
How should I know?

512
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,080
I'm sorry?

513
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:25,800
It's perch.
I'm sure it's fresh.

514
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:28,880
I'm sure it tastes
how perch usually does.

515
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:32,440
I can't afford to eat here,
so how should I know?

516
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,840
There's no need to be rude.

517
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Woman: Table 12.

518
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,800
Man: Can I get a side
of horseradish?

519
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:42,240
What's the perch taste like?

520
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,320
What?

521
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,240
The perch- how is it?

522
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:49,360
It's all right,
but the catfish is the business.

523
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:52,320
Yeah? What's that
taste like?

524
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,160
Are you telling me you've never
tried fish before?

525
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,600
Yeah, I have.

526
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,720
Okay, I'm not talking
out of the box or the can.

527
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:02,520
What kind of wonk
has never tasted fish before?

528
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:09,840
Okay, maybe not.

529
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,440
Come around here.
I'm gonna show you what it tastes like.

530
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,080
Come on.

531
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:20,440
Okay, now this right here
is perch, all right?

532
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,880
Now hold on.
Stay here.

533
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,680
Now this is catfish,

534
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:38,840
Cajun blackened, okay?

535
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,320
Okay.

536
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,640
It's my favorite.

537
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:48,120
Mm.

538
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,600
You made that?

539
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,920
Yeah.

540
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,920
Well, that is
surprisingly edible.

541
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,240
Well, I'm glad you like it.

542
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,840
Man: Hey, Julie.

543
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,960
Man #2: I need another special.

544
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,680
You don't want the perch.

545
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,000
What's this?

546
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,120
Catfish.

547
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:16,080
But I wanted the perch.

548
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:19,000
No, trust me,
you want the catfish.

549
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:21,160
The perch is all right,

550
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:23,760
the catfish is the business.

551
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:43,120
You know, it's really gonna be
really hard for you to ride that bike

552
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:45,080
with my foot
shoved up your ass.

553
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,040
Wow.

554
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:50,040
Oh, it's you. I thought you were
these guys from the other night.

555
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,800
- You ever let it down?
- What?

556
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,760
Your force field.

557
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,800
You know, you walk around
all up in your own shit

558
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,080
like you ain't got no time
for nobody else's goodness.

559
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:01,760
How does somebody get close enough
to give you what you need?

560
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,680
I don't need anything.

561
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,400
Everybody needs something.

562
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:08,160
As of right now, seems like
you might need a ride.

563
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,080
On that?

564
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:11,520
Yeah.

565
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:13,480
I don't think two bodies
can fit on that.

566
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:15,360
What, is it, like,
your little brother's bike?

567
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,920
Okay, let me tell you something
about this right here.

568
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:20,360
This is a masterpiece
of engineering.

569
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:23,040
This is the product
of my love and sweat.

570
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:25,320
And it can and will prove you wrong.
But as of right now,

571
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:28,960
I don't think I even want
to let you on this thing.

572
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:32,960
I mean, unless- and I mean,
only if you promise to be sweet.

573
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:37,040
Promise.

574
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:40,080
Are you always
that sensitive?

575
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:42,080
I mean, didn't your mama
breastfeed you?

576
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:44,760
Okay, that would be classified
as sour in my kitchen.

577
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:47,840
But I'm gonna pretend
that didn't happen.

578
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,920
Okay? Come on.

579
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:02,920
Now you promise
to be sweet, right?

580
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:05,200
Yeah.

581
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,280
I promise.

582
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:22,040
♪ She's mine ♪

583
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,080

584

- Hey, what's up?

587
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,320
Forget you.

588
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:59,400

589
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:02,000

♪ Yeah, she's mine. ♪

592
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,960
She must have been pretty.

593
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:13,120
Who?

594
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,520
RS.

595
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:18,400
RS was a he.

596
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,880
No, not like that.

597
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,840
He was a good friend of mine.

598
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,080
Does he have your initials
tattooed on his wrist?

599
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,600
No.

600
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,800
Why not?

601
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:32,320
'Cause I'm not dead.

602
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,800
Is this what you guys do
for fun around here?

603
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:43,040
I kind of try
not to have fun.

604
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,920
I try to stay working.

605
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:48,160
I got this great talent
for finding trouble

606
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,520
and getting all up in it,

607
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:52,600
so I stay busy.

608
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:56,120
You want to be a chef?

609
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:59,200
Yeah, I want my own restaurant.

610
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:01,440
Where did you learn
how to cook anyway,

611
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:04,000
home ec?

612
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,840
No, prison.

613
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,520
You lie.

614
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:14,040
No, for reaI.
I was at juvie.

615
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,680
I was younger then.

616
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,320
What were you in for?

617
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:20,000
Joyriding.

618
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:23,480
You're full of it.

619
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:26,600
I mean, it's not something
I'm trying to brag about.

620
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:29,440
I'm not proud of it.

621
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,080
Stealing cars, huh?

622
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:37,440
That's joyriding.

623
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,480
But I'm not into that anymore.

624
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:42,720
So the correctional system

625
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,440
totally corrected you.

626
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:48,240
Let me tell you something-

627
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,880
it's a miracle
that I'm even on the outside.

628
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:54,960
Where I'm at-
I did that, you know.

629
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:58,480
So if I go back-
I did that too.

630
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,680
That's cool.

631
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,800
Yeah.

632
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:09,160
But you'd still steal me
a BMW, right?

633
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,440
For you- anything.
I got you.

634
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,440
I just don't know
why you don't like my BMX.

635
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:16,560
It's the sickest right here.

636
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,760
Greta: Why do I say
the things I do?

637
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,000
They just come out
totally wrong.

638
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:28,120
Sometimes I just wish
I wouldn't say anything at all.

639
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,520
I like him.

640
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,320
Narrator:
... hundreds of others.

641
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:43,160
Interpreter: Handcuffed me, beat me,
denied me food and water.

642
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,400
Narrator:
Palden Gyatso endured

643
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,960
33 years of torture
in Chinese prison camps.

644
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,480
Uh, come on.
We found a show

645
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:59,440
I'd like to watch.
Let's watch it.

646
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:04,320
Morning, ladies.

647
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,640
- Hi, love.
- Hey, Gramps.

648
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,760
You want to go down
to the marina with me today,

649
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,760
help me work on my boat?

650
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,720
I can't, sorry.

651
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:15,360
I'm gonna hook up
with my friend Julie.

652
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:18,000
Julie?
You're making new friends already.

653
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:25,600
Why don't you invite
Julie to lunch?

654
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:31,120
Okay.

655
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,720
That's a good idea.

656
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,440
Good morning, ma'am.

657
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:39,360
We're not interested.

658
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:44,240
Is Greta here?

659
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:49,440
Hey. Grams, this is Julie.

660
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,640
How do you do, ma'am?

661
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:57,280
Everything looks really great.

662
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,120
Thank you.

663
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,800
Julie knows food.

664
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,360
He's a chef.

665
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,920
Really?

666
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:07,400
No, I'm just a line cook,

667
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:09,360
but I'm working on
becoming one.

668
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:13,160
I hope to own
my own restaurant one day.

669
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:16,160
Why don't you tell them
where you learned how to cook?

670
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:20,000
He learned in prison.

671
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:24,320
He got busted
for stealing cars.

672
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,800
Something the matter, Grams?

673
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:34,320
So that would make you
an ex-con?

674
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:37,280
Yeah, but I'm not
that guy anymore, so...

675
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:40,280
I'm sure. I understand
that a little prison time

676
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,880
totally transforms everyone.

677
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,120
Yeah, well, that's just it,
you know.

678
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:48,200
All the kids that were
in the juvenile detention center with me

679
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:50,800
had been in and out of there
a dozen times.

680
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:54,920
Seeing that helped me realize
you get out the same way you get in-

681
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:58,000
on your own.
And so I straightened myself out.

682
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,040
Well, good for you.

683
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:04,320
Of course, it would
have been better

684
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,920
if you hadn't gotten in
in the first place.

685
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:08,800
You're absolutely right, ma'am.

686
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:17,280
Is there celery
in this potato salad?

687
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,040
Mm-hmm.

688
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,280
With a little bit
of sweet relish?

689
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,000
Yes, there is.

690
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:25,480
I thought Mom made
the best potato salad.

691
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:27,000
I think this got that beat.

692
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:28,800
It's my mother's recipe.

693
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,880
You mind if I steal it?

694
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:33,720
Oh, I thought you had
given up stealing.

695
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:43,840
Julie! Julie, wait.

696
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,120
That was bullshit,
you know that?

697
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,560
How are you gonna put
my business out there

698
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:49,200
- just to you could scare her?
- It was a joke.

699
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:52,200
Okay, well, you know what? I don't
like being the punchline of your joke.

700
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:55,360
What's with you anyway?
Why are you like this?

701
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:57,440
You didn't think twice
about leaving me out to dry

702
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,000
just so you can school her.

703
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:01,920
And you know what bothers me even more
than you playing me right now?

704
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:06,080
You're staring me with those
big, sexy eyes and, you know-

705
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,480
You want to kiss me.

706
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,440
Hell yeah, I want to kiss you.

707
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:12,600
Yeah.

00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:40,320
- Really?
- Yeah.

716
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,120
What's this?

717
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:44,080
Oh, hey, give me that.

718
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:45,440
- Let me see.
- It's nothing.

719
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:47,280
- What is it?
- Julie, give it back.

720
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,680
- Wait, what is that?
- Julie, seriously.

721
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:51,960
"Learn how to ride
a unicycle. "

722
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:55,400
God damn it.
Come on.

723
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:58,280
"Become fluent
in the African clicking language.

724
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:00,680
Create the first gummy museum. "

725
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:03,280
- Seriously, can you give it back to me?
- What the hell is this?

726
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,360
It's just a to-do list, okay?

727
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,560
You want to do all this stuff?
"Lose all my virginity. "

728
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:10,000
- Screw you. Stop.
- It's getting too good right now.

729
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:14,600
"To die. "
Oh, man.

730
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,400
"Get pureed in a jet engine.

Skydive nude
with no parachute. "

733
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:24,400
You want to do all this stuff too?
You can't do all this stuff.

734
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:27,000
Jerk, stop laughing at me.
The one serious thing in my life,

735
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:28,360
and you're laughing.

736
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:30,720
Greta, you want to kill
somebody?

737
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:33,760
Just myself, okay?
Don't worry about it.

738
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:35,880
You need to stop
talking shit.

739
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:37,360
I'm not.

740
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:40,640
I'm not talking shit.

741
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,720
I'm not.

742
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:49,160
So why do you want
to kill yourself?

743
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:53,200
That's the stupidest thing
I've ever heard all day today,

744
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:55,040
and today has been
straight up retarded.

745
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,120
You know what I think's
retarded?

746
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:59,760
Wanting to own a restaurant.

747
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:12,480
Look, I've got one more year
of high schooI left,

748
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:14,040
and then what?

749
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:16,360
Be like my mother,

750
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:18,720
desperate for companionship?

751
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:21,560
Or my grandparents?
They're afraid of their own shadow.

752
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:23,680
They're prisoners
in their own little world.

753
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:26,080
So you get 16 years
of having a good time

754
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:29,040
and then 60
running away from death?

755
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:32,280
Not me.

756
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:34,760
I'm gonna quit
while I'm ahead.

757
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:47,360
You have an extremely

758
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:49,920
extremely cynical look on life.

759
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:51,840
But you're so lucky.

760
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,560
And you're such a privileged
person, you know?

761
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:59,000
You should appreciate
what you got good.

762
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:05,560
That's what I'm doing.

763
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:14,200
I'm trying to appreciate

764
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:16,560
what I have good right now.

765
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,640
Hello.

766
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:53,920
Oh my God.
Oh my God.

767
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:05,760
Katherine: Do you think
it's a literary reference or what?

768
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:09,000
- Have you ever heard of that?
- No.

769
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:11,200
You guys look bright-eyed
and bushy-tailed.

770
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:14,040
All right, just don't.
Don't even.

771
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:16,000
You want some tea?

772
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:18,200
- No, thanks.
- Katherine: Thank you.

773
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:20,200
- How is that?
- It's still hot.

774
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:21,480
I'll say.

775
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:23,360
Greta, didn't anybody
ever teach you

776
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:26,160
not to barge into people's rooms
without knocking?

777
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:27,920
Well, I'm sorry.

778
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:32,200
I didn't realize
that you guys still do that.

779
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:36,480
Well, that's a very conventional
point of view, isn't it?

780
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:38,880
Looks like another
hot one today,

781
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:41,160
another hot and sweaty one.

782
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:43,720
That's funny.
I feel perfectly cool.

783
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:46,400
I know that you guys were
a little preoccupied last night,

784
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:48,120
but I came home on time.

785
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:50,400
Congratulations.

786
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:53,080
Of course, you could have told us
it was your day off.

787
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:55,680
Well, you could have let me know
it was your day to get off.

788
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:57,720
Oh, Greta, you just
don't stop, do you?

789
00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:00,280
You just have to push it
as far as you can.

790
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:04,000
Well, I may not
know much, kiddo,

791
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:06,560
but I know when it's time
to get out of Dodge.

792
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:13,760
So where's that old hunk of junk
you've been working on?

793
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:16,040
You're looking at her.

794
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:18,080
No way.

795
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:20,320
Yeah, uh-huh.

796
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:22,160
That's pretty pimp.

797
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:23,720
What happened?

798
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:27,040
You know,
a little elbow grease,

799
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:29,480
a lot of love,
a lot of patience.

800
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:31,720
I think it's gonna be
worth the effort, though,

801
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:33,120
when your grandma sees it.

802
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:35,680
It's so dope,

803
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:39,120
definitely the best-looking boat
on the marina.

804
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:40,880
Thanks.

805
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:43,200
Didn't you just
have breakfast?

806
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:44,800
Yeah.

807
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:48,440
Where are we going?

808
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:53,120
We're not going anywhere today.
I've got a lot of work to do on this engine.

809
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:55,080
Fine by me.

810
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:57,640
I get seasick
watching "Gilligan's Island. "

811
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:18,360
Greta, can I talk to you
for a minute?

812
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:21,240
Thanks to the Bill of Rights.

813
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:26,720
This morning your grandmother
found a pill in the toilet bowI,

814
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:30,240
a little white pill
just stuck there.

815
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:32,600
And?

816
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:35,000
You want to tell me
what that's all about?

817
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:37,480
I haven't spoken to your mother
about it yet,

818
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:39,080
but I think
I'm gonna have to.

819
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:41,360
What do you think it is- Ex?

820
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:42,960
What?

821
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:47,360
It's Lexapro.

822
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:49,800
It's an SSRl,

823
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:52,240
which means that it's-

824
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:54,640
I forget what it means,

825
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:58,640
but it's supposed to make me
normal and boring.

826
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:00,600
Dr. Glickman put me on it

827
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:04,120
after I set Edgar's briefcase
on fire.

828
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:10,560
What was it doing in the toilet?

829
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:12,880
I stopped taking it
months ago.

830
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:16,920
I don't feel right
when I'm on it, you know.

831
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:19,200
And plus, they say,
"Just say no,"

832
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:21,360
and then they turn around
and write you a prescription

833
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:24,960
for some mood-altering drug.
It's so stupid.

834
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:28,440
Yeah, but if he prescribed it,
maybe you should be taking it.

835
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:30,240
The only reason
he even wrote the scrip

836
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:32,280
is because Mom saw
an ad somewhere

837
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:35,000
and he does everything
that Mom tells him.

838
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:37,960
Your mother is just trying
to do what she thinks is best for you.

839
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:39,440
You know, she loves you.

840
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:41,400
- No, she doesn't.
- Yes, she does.

841
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:43,120
Then why am I here?

842
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:47,360
She doesn't know
what do with you, Greta.

843
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:54,800
You know what?

844
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:56,800
If the house was on fire

845
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:00,320
and she could choose
to save me or Edgar,

846
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:02,480
I think that she'd choose Edgar.

847
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:06,480
I really think that.

848
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:26,360
Woman: Hey, Greta,
table 9 wants you.

849
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:33,120
Hey, remember us?

850
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:36,000
Yeah.
What do you want?

851
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:38,400
Well, we don't know. We thought
maybe you could help us decide.

852
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:41,920
We had a really good time
last time.

853
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:44,800
Yeah? What am I,
a goddamn sideshow?

854
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:49,280
What the hell do you want?

855
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:54,280
Excuse me.
Greta, could I see you?

856
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:57,840
Thank you.

857
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:02,080
Look, the attitude was cute
for a while,

858
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:04,040
but you gotta shape up.

859
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:06,000
Now I'm gonna put Donna
on that table,

860
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:09,640
so just take it easy, okay?

861
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:23,520
- Hey.
- Hey.

862
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:25,880
Can we go to the beach later?

863
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:28,160
Yeah, we can.

864
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:31,200
But you have to let go of me
so I don't burn anything, okay?

865
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:47,000
Can I get a refill?

866
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:50,000
Do I look anything
like your waitress?

867
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:51,960
Sit down, Greta.

868
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:53,920
I'm not trying to pick on you,

869
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:56,520
but you have to treat customers
like what they are.

870
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:58,600
Thumbtacks in my ass?

871
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:00,560
No, they're your employers.

872
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:03,640
They're my employers.
They pay our salaries.

873
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:07,800
All right.

874
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:10,160
Do you want to fire me?

875
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:12,240
You're an unusual girl.

876
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:14,200
You have more confidence

877
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:16,720
and self-assurance
than any adult I know.

878
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:19,040
You can go very far in life.

879
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:21,240
Except you have this way

880
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:23,360
of poking people in the eye
with your words.

881
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:27,360
You know what, Lou? I really
don't need this hassle tonight, okay?

882
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:29,320
I'm being very kind here.

883
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:32,440
Well, save your charity
for someone who wants it, okay?

884
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:35,680
If you don't want me working here,
then fire me.

885
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:38,680
Why don't you take
tomorrow night off?

886
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:42,640
Maybe I will.

887
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:45,520
I'll take tomorrow night off,
and the next night after that,

888
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:47,880
and the night after that,
and after that,

889
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:50,440
and after that,
and then after that one...

890
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:57,160
- Greta, wait.
- I quit.

891
00:52:57,320 --> 00:52:59,040
- Let me just talk to Lou.
- Don't you dare.

892
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:01,120
I'm sick of wasting my time
in this lousy dump.

893
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:03,480
It's not that bad, okay?
I'm gonna go in there

894
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:05,840
and I gotta mop.
It should take 10 minutes. Stay.

895
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,280
No way.

896
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:09,880
You can meet me
at my house later.

897
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:12,200
What about your grandmother?

898
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:14,680
What about
my lousy grandmother?

Hell no.
I ain't climbing up that.

I want you to come up here.

Well, you know, they are
these balloon thingies

939
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:48,800
- and two people use them-
- Yeah, I know what they are.

940
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:53,640
I didn't know what size to get,

941
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:57,320
so I got Magnums.

942
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:02,080
We're not about to use this.

943
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:03,680
Yes, we are.

944
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:06,680
I mean, it's not gonna be
that way.

945
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:08,560
We're not about to have sex.

946
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:12,480
What's wrong?

947
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:14,720
There's nothing wrong.

948
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:16,720
That's the problem.
See, I really like you

949
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:20,000
and I don't want to be one of those things
you check off your to-do list.

950
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:22,320
You know,
you can't control

951
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:24,600
every damn thing
that happens in your life.

952
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:28,160
Some things just gotta have
their own rhythm, you know?

953
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:29,720
You gotta go with that.

954
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:31,960
You know what I mean?

955
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:34,120
So you don't think
I'm gross or anything?

956
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:37,000
No.

957
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:40,080
You're trouble for sure, yeah,

958
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:43,840
'cause you're hot
and you're sexy and you're smart.

959
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:04,640
- Why are cops here?
- Shit.

960
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:06,560
Julie.

961
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:09,000
Julie, wait.
Where are you going?

962
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:11,320
- I gotta go.
- Julie.

963
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:13,280
I gotta get out of here.

964
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:15,920
What are you doing?
Julie, Julie.

965
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:18,880
Hey, get out of there.

966
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:22,200
Come on, get down.
On the ground. On the ground.

967
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:23,880
I didn't do anything.

968
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:25,400
Shit.

969
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:28,600
Come on, junior.
Get up, get up.

970
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:30,720
Just one second, man.
I didn't do nothing.

971
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:33,440
- Wait wait, hold on, hold on.
- Easy now.

972
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:35,920
Mrs. O'Donnell, you gotta tell them.
They made a mistake.

973
00:57:36,080 --> 00:57:37,520
What's going on here?

974
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:39,600
A neighbor spotted this individual
climbing up your trellis, ma'am.

975
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:41,960
- Ma'am, do you know this person?
- Yes, of course.

976
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:43,920
I thought you were through
with stealing.

977
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:46,840
I wasn't stealing anything.
It's a mix-up. They made a mistake.

978
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,320
Leave him alone.

979
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:51,640
Just one second, man.
I didn't do nothing.

980
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:54,560
Grams, tell them to stop, please.
He's gonna be in so much trouble.

981
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:56,440
- What is he doing here?
- I invited him here.

982
00:57:56,600 --> 00:57:59,840
- To do what exactly?
- What's going on here?

983
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,400
Gramps, please
make them stop.

984
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:04,000
Okay, that's it. I've had it.
I'm calling your mother right now.

985
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:06,440
You're insane.

986
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:08,240
- Look, he didn't do anything.
- No, back inside.

987
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:10,520
Joseph: Katherine, don't get Karen
all riled up.

988
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:12,600
Gramps, they're gonna
take him in.

989
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:14,320
- I've got to call her mother.
- You have to go tell them.

990
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:16,760
He didn't do anything wrong.
I promise.

991
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:18,760
- He crawled through my window.
- Shut up, Grams.

992
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:20,720
- Don't talk to her that way.
- Please, it's not fair.

993
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:22,640
You're not helping things.
Now listen to me.

994
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:24,600
Go upstairs
and let me deal with this.

995
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:27,080
I will take care of this.
Yes yes, right now.

996
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:29,600
I will take care of this.
I will deal with it. Go on, go on.

997
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:31,400
Go on.

998
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:33,680
Oh, that girl-
she is totally out of control.

999
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:35,640
I mean, just once
she's got to learn

1000
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:38,120
that she can't have everything
her own way.

1001
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:43,520
She's your family, Katherine.
She's your flesh and blood.

1002
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:47,120
She's not some enemy
you have to defeat.

1003
00:58:56,800 --> 00:59:00,200
I apologize for all this,
Mr. O'Donnell.

1004
00:59:00,360 --> 00:59:02,720
And I hope I didn't get Greta
in too much trouble.

1005
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:04,960
Thanks.

1006
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:07,360
And I think you got it backwards.
I think she's the one

1007
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:08,960
who got you in trouble.

1008
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:11,720
I like her, you know.
I really like Greta

1009
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:15,600
and she's worth it,

1010
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:18,360
but I'm worried about her,
you know?

1011
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:20,600
Does she ever talk to you about-?

1012
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:24,480
She's got that little notebook
she carries around.

1013
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:26,760
Do you-?

1014
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:39,520
Greta ever say anything to you
about her father?

1015
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:43,080
She doesn't talk too much
about personal stuff, you know.

1016
00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:46,400
Well, it's something we don't
talk about very much in this family either,

1017
00:59:46,560 --> 00:59:49,080
but I think you've earned the right
to know about it.

1018
00:59:51,080 --> 00:59:54,320
Greta's father killed himself.

1019
00:59:55,960 --> 00:59:58,080
She was just a little kid,

1020
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:00,000
five, six years old.

1021
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:03,800
He took his shotgun
and stuck it in his mouth.

1022
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:07,080
She was there.
She walked in on him.

1023
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:10,800
You know, I don't know

1024
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:12,800
how much of it
she remembers,

1025
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:16,200
how much
she carries around with her,

1026
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:18,400
but here she is,
all grown up,

1027
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:20,880
and writing that list.

1028
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:25,760
You know, it may be a phase
she's going through.

1029
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:29,120
It may be just some idea
that she has to reckon with,

1030
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:32,600
but I think-

1031
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:35,280
I think it's our job

1032
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:37,280
to try and help her
through it.

1033
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:39,840
Wow.

1034
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:42,880
Yeah.

1035
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:45,840
Well, go on home.

1036
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:47,800
Get some sleep.

1037
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:50,280
Thank you, sir.

1038
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:53,520
- Hey, Julie.
- Yeah?

1039
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:55,280

I've got you.
I've got you.

1087
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:14,680
Okay, right there, right there.

1088
01:05:14,840 --> 01:05:17,960
Are you all right?

1089
01:05:18,120 --> 01:05:19,920
Yeah. Are you okay?

1090
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:21,880
- Are you okay, honey?
- My head.

1091
01:05:22,040 --> 01:05:24,320
You hit your head?
Let me see it.

1092
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:27,160
Turn it.

1093
01:05:27,320 --> 01:05:29,200
Joseph: It's not bleeding.

1094

Grams.

1095
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:36,720
Katherine, Katherine.

Are you all right?

1097
01:05:39,160 --> 01:05:41,560
- Grams.
- I'm gonna get on the radio.

1098
01:05:41,720 --> 01:05:44,800
Grams, hey.

1099
01:05:56,320 --> 01:05:58,480
It was a mild heart attack.
She's okay.

1100
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:00,800
She's gonna have to be
on medication from now on, though.

1101
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:03,680
But she's okay.
They want to keep her here tonight

1102
01:06:03,840 --> 01:06:05,360
and run some more tests.

1103
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:07,840
I'm gonna stay with her
untiI she goes to sleep.

1104
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,600
You two go on home,

1105
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:11,920
get out of this
air conditioning.

1106
01:06:48,080 --> 01:06:51,040
Hey, here.

1107
01:06:54,040 --> 01:06:55,800
You're not gonna stay?

1108
01:06:55,960 --> 01:07:00,200
No, you can check me off
that list of yours.

1109
01:07:00,360 --> 01:07:02,120
I'm done.

1110
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:04,320
What?

1111
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:06,800
What are you talking about?

1112
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:11,080
Are you serious?

1113
01:07:11,240 --> 01:07:12,720
You really don't get it?

1114
01:07:18,320 --> 01:07:20,920
Reggie Spiegel,

1115
01:07:21,080 --> 01:07:23,040
my roommate in juvie.

1116
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:27,200
One morning, Mother's Day...

1117
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:34,120
I found him hanging
by an electric cord.

1118
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:42,400
I didn't see it coming
'cause he didn't mouth off about it.

1119
01:07:42,560 --> 01:07:44,800
He didn't want to be saved.

1120
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:46,720
See, you knew I'd jump in
after you

1121
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:49,240
'cause you didn't want to die.

1122
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:51,320
You just wanted that drama.

1123
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:54,040
- No, I-
- What you did was serious.

1124
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:56,320
And it affects people.

1125
01:07:56,480 --> 01:07:59,000
It affects me.

1126
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:03,960
I wish I could help you,
'cause you need it.

1127
01:08:05,040 --> 01:08:07,200
But I'm not going
overboard for you.

1128
01:08:07,360 --> 01:08:10,440
I got my own shit.
I'm doing my own thing.

1129
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:12,960
You know?

1130
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:11,720
"April 10th, 1962.

1131
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:15,800
My sweet sweet Joseph,

1132
01:09:15,960 --> 01:09:18,520
you set saiI
less than an hour ago

1133
01:09:18,680 --> 01:09:20,920
and I'm kicking myself already.

1134
01:09:21,080 --> 01:09:23,320
Please forgive me.

1135
01:09:23,480 --> 01:09:25,600
I only treated you that way

1136
01:09:25,760 --> 01:09:28,360
because I was mad
about you leaving.

1137
01:09:28,520 --> 01:09:30,320
I've been silly,

1138
01:09:30,480 --> 01:09:33,480
prone to capriciousness.

1139
01:09:33,640 --> 01:09:36,800
I'm mad at myself

1140
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:39,680
for wasting our last
moments together,

1141
01:09:39,840 --> 01:09:42,000
for not telling you

1142
01:09:42,160 --> 01:09:44,280
how I really feel.

1143
01:09:44,440 --> 01:09:46,880
I love you

1144
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:51,040
and I've missed my chance
to tell you in person.

1145
01:09:51,200 --> 01:09:53,800
If something happens to you,
I'll just die.

1146
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:57,600
I miss you, Joseph.

1147
01:09:57,760 --> 01:10:00,400
Promise you'll come home safely.

1148
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:02,880
Forever yours, Katherine. "

1149
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:37,960
Grams.

1150
01:12:10,840 --> 01:12:13,360
Okay, close your eyes.

1151
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:15,880
Katherine: Can I trust you?

1152
01:12:16,920 --> 01:12:19,960
Okay, this way.

1153
01:12:21,720 --> 01:12:23,520
Can I open my eyes yet?

1154
01:12:23,680 --> 01:12:25,760
Mm, okay.

1155
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:34,400
Oh, you didn't have to
do that, Greta.

1156
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:36,640
Those flowers
are expensive.

1157
01:12:39,880 --> 01:12:43,160
Can't you see that I'm trying
to say I'm sorry?

1158
01:12:46,760 --> 01:12:49,520
Well, then say it.

1159
01:12:49,680 --> 01:12:52,360
I just did.

1160
01:12:52,520 --> 01:12:54,000
No.

1161
01:12:54,160 --> 01:12:56,960
You don't even know
what you're sorry for.

1162
01:12:57,120 --> 01:12:59,600
I'm fighting to save my life

1163
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:02,760
and you're trying
to throw yours away.

1164
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:04,880
Now why is that?

1165
01:13:07,680 --> 01:13:10,400
'Cause...

1166
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:13,760
I want to be
like the girl in this picture,

1167
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:16,040
young and alive.

1168
01:13:16,200 --> 01:13:18,600
I haven't seen this picture since-

1169
01:13:20,440 --> 01:13:22,320
I wasn't any older
than you there.

1170
01:13:22,480 --> 01:13:25,360
You look like a totally
different person,

1171
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:28,200
so happy.
Don't you miss that?

1172
01:13:28,360 --> 01:13:30,880
Well, no.

1173
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:33,920
You're telling me
that you wouldn't jump at the chance

1174
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:35,880
if you could turn
the clock back?

1175
01:13:36,040 --> 01:13:37,680
No.

1176
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:40,200
I wouldn't.

1177
01:13:41,240 --> 01:13:43,600
You see...

1178
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:47,360
I was a different person then.

1179
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:51,040
I didn't know anything
about the world or myself.

1180
01:13:51,200 --> 01:13:55,360
I had no perspective.

1181
01:13:58,480 --> 01:14:01,320
This was a long time ago.

1182
01:14:03,800 --> 01:14:05,600
And every day since then,

1183
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:07,960
every experience I've had,

1184
01:14:08,120 --> 01:14:10,600
every person I've met

1185
01:14:10,760 --> 01:14:15,200
has carved an impression on me.

1186
01:14:16,200 --> 01:14:19,160
You know, this girl, this child-

1187
01:14:19,320 --> 01:14:22,040
she's just a fraction
of what I've become-

1188
01:14:22,200 --> 01:14:25,680
a wife, a mother,
a grandmother-

1189
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:27,160
me.

1190
01:14:27,320 --> 01:14:29,560
Oh, honey,
you have no idea

1191
01:14:29,720 --> 01:14:32,640
what's ahead of you.

1192
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:36,560
It's all such an incredible
adventure.

1193
01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:43,920
Do you have a picture of my dad?

1194
01:14:45,480 --> 01:14:48,040
I just want to know
what he looks like.

1195
01:14:48,200 --> 01:14:51,240
You've never seen
a picture of your father?

1196
01:14:52,240 --> 01:14:54,160
No.

1197
01:14:56,160 --> 01:14:58,480
Sweetheart.

1198
01:15:11,080 --> 01:15:12,880
What are they doing here?

1199
01:15:13,040 --> 01:15:14,800
Mom.

1200
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:17,120
Hiya, all.

1201
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:19,600
Are you okay?

1202
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:22,160
Shouldn't you be
sitting down or something?

1203
01:15:22,320 --> 01:15:24,120
- I'm fine, dear. Hello.
- I'm so sorry.

1204
01:15:24,280 --> 01:15:26,600
What are you doing here?

1205
01:15:26,760 --> 01:15:28,720
Gramps, what are they
doing here?

1206
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:30,960
Greta, go inside
and get your things.

1207
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:32,440
I don't want to go home
with you.

1208
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:34,240
We're not taking you
home, Greta.

1209
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:37,240
Then why are you he-?

1210
01:15:37,400 --> 01:15:40,360
You're gonna send me
to that boot camp.

1211
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:43,160
Go get your things, Greta.

1212
01:15:43,320 --> 01:15:45,520
Wait a minute.
What's this boot camp stuff?

1213
01:15:45,680 --> 01:15:48,080
No, it's a special
summer camp

1214
01:15:48,240 --> 01:15:50,600
for kids like her,

1215
01:15:50,760 --> 01:15:52,240
to straighten her out.

1216
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:55,400
Gramps, why didn't you tell me
that they were coming?

1217
01:15:55,560 --> 01:15:57,400
I asked your grandfather
not to say anything.

1218
01:15:57,560 --> 01:15:59,440
We didn't want you
running off or something.

1219
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:02,240
- Greta.
- Edgar: Come on now.

1220
01:16:03,200 --> 01:16:05,160
Karen: Greta.

1221
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:17,600
My mom is here.

1222
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:20,920
She's gonna send me away
to some boot camp place.

1223
01:16:21,080 --> 01:16:22,840
What am I gonna do?

1224
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,040
What can you do?

1225
01:16:25,200 --> 01:16:27,480
There's got to be something.

1226
01:16:27,640 --> 01:16:30,440
I guess you could
check the camp out,

1227
01:16:30,600 --> 01:16:31,880
see what it's all about.

1228
01:16:32,040 --> 01:16:34,680
You think I'm screwed up
and that place is gonna save me?

1229
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:36,320
Yeah, you're screwed up.

1230
01:16:38,040 --> 01:16:40,160
But that place can't fix you.

1231
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:41,760
Only you can fix you.

1232
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:44,920
If that's not what you want,
it ain't gonna happen.

1233
01:16:52,640 --> 01:16:55,120
I'm really sorry.

1234
01:16:55,280 --> 01:16:57,720
Well, that's a start.

1235
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:11,800
- You smell like food.
- Yeah.

1236
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:13,920
Yeah.

1237
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:23,640
Call me when you get it all
figured out, okay?

1238
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:29,720
All right.

1239
01:17:39,320 --> 01:17:41,400
Have a nice walk?

1240
01:17:41,560 --> 01:17:43,920
Did Mom leave?

1241
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:46,240
She's here now,
so come on back.

1242
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:48,280
You all finished
with your little tantrum?

1243
01:17:48,440 --> 01:17:49,800
What are you doing
with my stuff?

1244
01:17:49,960 --> 01:17:51,960
I packed your things.
You've wasted enough time already.

1245
01:17:52,120 --> 01:17:54,400
I don't want to go.
Please, please let me stay.

1246
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:56,400
Your grandmother
does not want you here.

1247
01:17:56,560 --> 01:17:59,280
- That's not true.
- That's what you told me last week.

1248
01:17:59,440 --> 01:18:01,320
"There's no winning with her,"
you said.

1249
01:18:01,480 --> 01:18:02,760
Did I say that?

1250
01:18:02,920 --> 01:18:05,280
Well, that was then
and this is now.

1251
01:18:05,440 --> 01:18:07,800
And if Greta wants to stay,
I would quite like to have her.

1252
01:18:07,960 --> 01:18:10,200
- I'm staying.
- No, you're not.

1253
01:18:10,360 --> 01:18:11,880
- Mom.
- Shh.

1254
01:18:12,040 --> 01:18:15,400
- Greta, let go.
- Be careful there. Be careful.

1255
01:18:15,560 --> 01:18:16,680
Mom.

1256
01:18:16,840 --> 01:18:18,800
- Quiet down and give me the bag.
- What's wrong with you?

1257
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:20,440
- Greta, stop it.
- Edgar: What's going on?

1258
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:22,080
- Mom, please.
- Stop making a scene.

1259
01:18:22,240 --> 01:18:23,800
- Edgar: What are you doing?
- Edgar, I could use some help.

1260
01:18:23,960 --> 01:18:25,760
- Be careful. Don't hurt her.
- Come on now.

1261
01:18:25,920 --> 01:18:27,840
Mrs. Wocheski: What the hell
is going on over there?

1262
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,360
All right, just stop.
Everybody just stop.

1263
01:18:39,160 --> 01:18:42,560
Greta, get up.

1264
01:18:42,720 --> 01:18:44,920
Please, Katherine, sit down.

1265
01:18:45,080 --> 01:18:46,880
I'm sick of all this.

1266
01:18:47,040 --> 01:18:49,160
I'm tired of all this screaming
and yelling and fighting

1267
01:18:49,320 --> 01:18:51,040
and the police on my porch
in the middle of the night

1268
01:18:51,200 --> 01:18:52,920
and my wife upset
every 15 minutes.

1269
01:18:53,080 --> 01:18:55,200
I don't want to hear
another word

1270
01:18:55,360 --> 01:18:57,680
about this boot camp nonsense.

1271
01:18:57,840 --> 01:19:00,440
Dad, look,
with all due respect,

1272
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:02,480
you really don't have
any say here.

1273
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:03,800
Oh, yes, I do.

1274
01:19:03,960 --> 01:19:05,880
I earned it when you
dumped her on us this summer.

1275
01:19:06,040 --> 01:19:09,360
This kid needs love
and understanding and patience.

1276
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:11,600
Do you hear yourself?

1277
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:15,000
Where was the love and understanding
when I needed it,

1278
01:19:15,160 --> 01:19:17,800
when you let her
run me out of the house

1279
01:19:17,960 --> 01:19:19,520
because she didn't like
my boyfriend?

1280
01:19:19,680 --> 01:19:21,360
What? I never threw you
out of this house.

1281
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:23,640
I simply said you couldn't live here
and do drugs.

1282
01:19:23,800 --> 01:19:25,560
You two have a lot of nerve

1283
01:19:25,720 --> 01:19:27,960
bringing my parenting skills
into question.

1284
01:19:28,120 --> 01:19:31,280
Stop it.
Mom, stop talking to them like that.

1285
01:19:31,440 --> 01:19:33,720
Okay, I will go
to the stupid boot camp.

1286
01:19:33,880 --> 01:19:36,960
- No, Greta, Greta.
- Wait wait.

1287
01:19:37,120 --> 01:19:39,720
- Greta's staying here.
- Dad.

1288
01:19:39,880 --> 01:19:42,040
- And so are you.
- No, I'm not.

1289
01:19:42,200 --> 01:19:44,280
We're gonna make this right.
We're gonna fix it.

1290
01:19:44,440 --> 01:19:46,600
We're gonna get to know
one another, this family of ours.

1291
01:19:46,760 --> 01:19:49,560
Dad, I have a job.

1292
01:19:49,720 --> 01:19:52,560
Well, you've got vacation time
saved up, haven't you?

1293
01:19:52,720 --> 01:19:55,520
Well, yeah, but that's for Bermuda
in the fall.

1294
01:19:55,680 --> 01:19:58,160
Oh, you're taking your daughter
to Bermuda in the fall, are you?

1295
01:19:58,320 --> 01:20:01,080
No, just Edgar and I.

1296
01:20:01,240 --> 01:20:02,200
Uh-huh.

1297
01:20:02,360 --> 01:20:04,960
No, you cannot make Edgar
spend his vacation here.

1298
01:20:05,120 --> 01:20:06,520
Edgar isn't invited.

1299
01:20:06,680 --> 01:20:08,720
This is between us and you
and Greta.

1300
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:12,040
And if Edgar really loves you,
he can just do without you for a little while

1301
01:20:12,200 --> 01:20:13,560
while you save
your daughter's life.

1302
01:20:13,720 --> 01:20:16,160
When you put it like that,
I have to say-

1303
01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:18,440
- You're not gonna leave me here?
- Yeah.

1304
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:19,960
You're leaving me here?

1305
01:20:20,120 --> 01:20:21,880
Yeah, this is the best idea
any of us have had.

1306
01:20:22,040 --> 01:20:25,240
You know, I think your dad is right.
This could be good for everyone.

1307
01:20:25,400 --> 01:20:28,400
- Edgar.
- See you in a couple of weeks.

1308
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:31,000
- Edgar.
- You'll be fine, sweetheart.

1309
01:20:31,160 --> 01:20:33,240
Oh, this is grand.

1310
01:20:33,400 --> 01:20:35,440
Oh, this is gonna really
be helpfuI.

1311
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:37,240
Go on, you two, yuck it up.

1312
01:20:37,400 --> 01:20:38,800
I don't even have
any clothes to wear.

1313
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:40,920
Grandma's got some dresses
you could wear.

1314
01:20:41,080 --> 01:20:44,080
- Edgar: Bye, all.
- You two are exactly alike.

1315
01:20:44,240 --> 01:20:46,040
And you-

1316
01:21:07,120 --> 01:21:09,560
Here.

1317
01:21:09,720 --> 01:21:10,960
Here he is.

1318
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:13,080
Oh, yeah, there he is.

1319
01:21:17,520 --> 01:21:19,800
He was handsome.

1320
01:21:21,560 --> 01:21:24,320
I dream about him sometimes,

1321
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:26,840
but he never looks the same.

1322
01:21:28,400 --> 01:21:30,720
You have his eyes.

1323
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:32,480
Yeah?

1324
01:21:32,640 --> 01:21:34,520
And his brains.

1325
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:38,360
Well, I'll try to keep mine
inside my skull.

1326
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:52,840
I always loved
that picture of you.

1327
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:53,960
God.

1328
01:21:54,120 --> 01:21:56,440
Oh my God.

1329
01:21:56,600 --> 01:21:58,720
What happened to your hair, Mom?

1330
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:00,520
The 1980s.

1331
01:22:00,680 --> 01:22:02,480
It's huge.

1332
01:22:02,640 --> 01:22:04,560
Katherine:

I'll probably be home
by the time you get this,

1338
01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:24,080
but I don't care.

1339
01:22:24,240 --> 01:22:26,560
I just wanted to thank you
