My name is Dale Kerrigan,
and this is my story.

2
00:00:38,592 --> 00:00:41,932
<i>Our family lives at 3 Highview Crescent,
Coolaroo.</i>

3
00:00:42,086 --> 00:00:44,924
<i>Dad bought this place
15 years ago for a steal.</i>

4
00:00:45,063 --> 00:00:48,363
<i>As the real estate agent
said, "Location, location, location."</i>

5
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:50,243
<i>And we're right next door
to the airport.</i>

6
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:54,389
<i>It will be very convenient
if we ever have to fly one day.</i>

7
00:00:57,944 --> 00:01:00,520
<i>Dad still can't work out
how he got it so cheap.</i>

8
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:03,775
<i>It's worth almost as much today
as when we bought it.</i>

9
00:01:03,842 --> 00:01:06,701
<i>Our street was going to be the heart
of a major housing development.</i>

10
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:08,939
<i>But it never got up.</i>

11
00:01:09,007 --> 00:01:12,702
<i>They reckon the planes put people off.
Them and the power lines.</i>

12
00:01:12,769 --> 00:01:16,073
<i>Not Dad. He reckons power lines
are a reminder...</i>

13
00:01:16,148 --> 00:01:18,594
<i>of man's ability
to generate electricity.</i>

14
00:01:18,667 --> 00:01:23,352
<i>He's always saying
great things like that.
That's why we love him so much.</i>

15
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:26,472
<i>Dad is the backbone
of the Kerrigan family.</i>

16
00:01:26,542 --> 00:01:29,249
<i>He made our billiard table.</i>

17
00:01:29,316 --> 00:01:31,577
Shot, Dale.

18
00:01:31,643 --> 00:01:35,524
<i>In fact, he's built half this house.
He's always planning extensions.</i>

19
00:01:35,596 --> 00:01:37,444
I reckon we need a patio.

20
00:01:37,509 --> 00:01:40,498
Oh, darl, how about we finish
the back room first?

21
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:43,407
No, I'm waiting
on some cheap siding.

22
00:01:43,472 --> 00:01:45,352
I reckon we give
the patio another go.

23
00:01:45,416 --> 00:01:49,144
<i>Dad is a tow truck driver.
One of the best in the game.</i>

24
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:51,656
<i>He takes great pride
in his work.</i>

25
00:01:51,729 --> 00:01:54,338
<i>And he comes home
with so many stories.</i>

26
00:01:54,406 --> 00:01:56,765
You see, the car was wrapped
around the pole,

27
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:59,601
so I said, " Why not hook the chain
on the back axle?"

28
00:01:59,667 --> 00:02:01,515
See, no one
had thought of that.

29
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:05,363
<i>If Dad is the backbone,
Mum is the other bones. All of them.</i>

30
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:07,502
<i>She keeps
the family together.</i>

31
00:02:07,574 --> 00:02:09,954
<i>Dad adores Mum,
and Mum adores him.</i>

32
00:02:10,029 --> 00:02:13,312
<i>They met at the greyhounds one night,
and it was love at first sight.</i>

33
00:02:13,377 --> 00:02:16,660
<i>Mum just loves craft.
And she can pretty up
just about anything.</i>

34
00:02:16,724 --> 00:02:18,572
How did you do that?

35
00:02:18,637 --> 00:02:22,517
- Spray can and stencil, darl.
That's all you need.
- You could sell that.

36
00:02:22,591 --> 00:02:24,754
<i>Dad always reckons
Mum could open a shop,</i>

37
00:02:24,822 --> 00:02:27,626
<i>but she has a good part-time job
in the office at Sunbeam.</i>

38
00:02:27,691 --> 00:02:30,267
<i>Dad reckons Mum is
the greatest cook on Earth.</i>

39
00:02:30,338 --> 00:02:33,077
- What do you call that, darl?
- Sponge cake.

40
00:02:33,143 --> 00:02:36,035
Beautiful. And what's
that stuff on top?

41
00:02:36,108 --> 00:02:39,326
- Icing sugar.
- How is it, kids?

42
00:02:39,392 --> 00:02:42,610
And why would you want
to go out to a restaurant...

43
00:02:42,676 --> 00:02:45,002
when this keeps coming up
night after night?

44
00:02:45,067 --> 00:02:47,230
<i>I have two brothers
and a sister, all older than me.</i>

45
00:02:47,299 --> 00:02:51,561
<i>Steve is an apprentice mechanic,
but he spends most of his time
reading the Trading Post.</i>

46
00:02:51,635 --> 00:02:53,700
<i>He just loves
buying and trading.</i>

47
00:02:53,771 --> 00:02:55,934
Dad, ergonomic chairs.
Four of them.

48
00:02:56,003 --> 00:02:58,199
- What does he want?
- One-eighty.

49
00:02:58,266 --> 00:03:00,114
He's dreaming.

50
00:03:00,179 --> 00:03:02,886
<i>Him and Dad
really know bargains.</i>

51
00:03:02,953 --> 00:03:06,617
<i>Steve is also an ideas man.
That's why Dad calls him the ideas man.</i>

52
00:03:06,683 --> 00:03:08,531
<i>He has lots of ideas.</i>

53
00:03:08,596 --> 00:03:11,846
It's a motorcycle helmet
with a built-in brake light.

54
00:03:11,912 --> 00:03:14,749
You are an ideas man, Steve.

55
00:03:14,813 --> 00:03:17,259
<i>Dad thinks all of us
are tremendous,</i>

56
00:03:17,332 --> 00:03:19,657
<i>but I guess it's no secret
that Tracey's his favorite.</i>

57
00:03:19,723 --> 00:03:21,571
How do I look, Dad?

58
00:03:21,636 --> 00:03:23,569
<i>Dad just loves her.</i>

59
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:26,252
You look beautiful.

60
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:27,555
Thanks, Dad.

61
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:31,989
<i>Tracey's the only girl in the family,
apart from Mum and Gran.</i>

62
00:03:32,062 --> 00:03:34,834
<i>Tracey constantly
gave Dad proud moments.</i>

63
00:03:34,899 --> 00:03:38,051
<i>Once she was
on "The Price Is Right".</i>

64
00:03:38,119 --> 00:03:40,977
<i>It was such
an exciting afternoon for us.</i>

65
00:03:41,052 --> 00:03:42,900
Swap them around.

66
00:03:42,965 --> 00:03:45,954
<i>None of us could actually
believe it was Tracey up there
with Larry Emdier.</i>

67
00:03:46,025 --> 00:03:49,841
$45,000 worth of prizes.
The luggage needs to be more than 640.

68
00:03:49,915 --> 00:03:53,067
It needs to be less
than 740.

69
00:03:53,135 --> 00:03:55,428
<i>She almost won the lot.</i>

70
00:03:57,276 --> 00:03:59,147
<i>If only she'd known
the price of the luggage.</i>

71
00:03:59,286 --> 00:04:01,244
I'm so sorry about that.

72
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:04,206
<i>But she still managed to come home
with a tumble dryer and drill set.</i>

73
00:04:04,275 --> 00:04:09,526
<i>She is the only member of the Kerrigan
family who'd had a college education.</i>

74
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:13,263
<i>Dad reckons the day she graduated
as a fully-qualified hairdresser...</i>

75
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:15,558
<i>was about
the proudest day of his life.</i>

76
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:18,429
<i>I knew he thought
about that... a lot.</i>

77
00:04:18,494 --> 00:04:20,820
<i>There were only two places
he did his thinking--</i>

78
00:04:20,886 --> 00:04:24,962
<i>in the poolroom and out the back,
looking up at the power lines.</i>

79
00:04:25,825 --> 00:04:28,725
<i>Yep, Dad's a real thinker.</i>

80
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:32,476
<i>But the proudest day
was the day she got married
to this nice guy called Con.</i>

81
00:04:32,541 --> 00:04:35,693
<i>He is an accountant,
but also a fanatical kickboxer.</i>

82
00:04:35,761 --> 00:04:38,087
<i>Now Tracey's
taken up kickboxing too.</i>

83
00:04:38,153 --> 00:04:40,566
<i>Dad could not get
the smile off his face.</i>

84
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,965
<i>And he gave a speech
that brought the house down.</i>

85
00:04:43,031 --> 00:04:45,890
Now, as the bride's parents,
I don't mind paying for the wedding,

86
00:04:45,963 --> 00:04:48,703
but could you please stop busting
all them plates?

87
00:04:48,769 --> 00:04:51,889
That being
a Greek custom and all.

88
00:04:52,913 --> 00:04:54,848
I suppose, as a father,

89
00:04:54,923 --> 00:04:57,879
you'd like your daughter
to marry one of your own.

90
00:04:57,951 --> 00:05:01,734
And let's not beat around the bush.
The Greeks have a reputation.

91
00:05:01,809 --> 00:05:04,701
<i>At first, the Petropoulouses
thought he was having a go at them.</i>

92
00:05:04,774 --> 00:05:07,100
<i>But Dad was just saying
how much he thought of Con.</i>

93
00:05:07,165 --> 00:05:10,600
I never thought anyone
could love our Trace...

94
00:05:10,672 --> 00:05:12,770
as much as me,
Sal and the boys.

95
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,547
But there is
another person. Con.

96
00:05:17,242 --> 00:05:19,280
Smart, polite,
fit as a fiddle.

97
00:05:19,315 --> 00:05:23,509
And anyone who loves our Trace
as much as us deserves our love.

98
00:05:23,654 --> 00:05:27,452
So we love you, Con.
We love you.

99
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:29,413
Thank you, and, uh,

100
00:05:29,482 --> 00:05:32,103
"Kalispera".

101
00:05:32,266 --> 00:05:34,041
That's "Good evening."

102
00:05:37,935 --> 00:05:41,570
<i>We'd had many top nights,
but this was the most top.</i>

103
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:44,104
<i>Pity my oldest brother
couldn't be there.</i>

104
00:05:44,256 --> 00:05:47,016
<i>His name's Wayne.
He's in jail.</i>

105
00:05:47,463 --> 00:05:49,847
<i>Eight years
for armed robbery.</i>

106
00:05:50,086 --> 00:05:53,941
<i>Many people call him the black sheep
of the family. But not Mum and Dad.</i>

107
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,019
<i>He got caught up with the wrong crowd.
He didn't mean to rob the gas station.</i>

108
00:05:57,152 --> 00:06:01,002
<i>Now he's sorry. With good behavior,
he'll be out in a couple of years.</i>

109
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,074
<i>I visit him every Friday.</i>

110
00:06:03,557 --> 00:06:05,410
- How's Mum?
- Good.

111
00:06:07,091 --> 00:06:09,031
- How's Dad?
- Good.

112
00:06:11,235 --> 00:06:13,306
- How's Trace?
- Good.

113
00:06:16,323 --> 00:06:18,361
- How are you?
- Good.

114
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:23,236
- How's Dave?
- He's all right.

115
00:06:24,261 --> 00:06:25,347
Good.

116
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:29,045
<i>Even though he's the oldest
and I'm the youngest, we get on great.</i>

117
00:06:29,182 --> 00:06:31,107
<i>We can just chat for hours.</i>

118
00:06:32,127 --> 00:06:34,677
Thanks for coming down.

119
00:06:34,748 --> 00:06:37,266
- You want some chewy?
- No.

120
00:06:37,337 --> 00:06:41,359
<i>So, as you can see,
our family is very close-knit.</i>

121
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:43,948
<i>We also have pets.
Four greyhounds.</i>

122
00:06:44,019 --> 00:06:45,806
<i>Banshee,</i>

123
00:06:45,873 --> 00:06:47,628
<i>Starflash,</i>

124
00:06:47,696 --> 00:06:50,562
<i>Trailblazer and Coco.</i>

125
00:06:50,637 --> 00:06:54,082
<i>Coco is the best,
most successful Dad has ever had.</i>

126
00:06:54,154 --> 00:06:57,533
<i>She picked up two firsts
in the country and a third in town.</i>

127
00:06:57,607 --> 00:06:59,777
<i>Dad feeds them every morning
in big bowls...</i>

128
00:06:59,844 --> 00:07:02,330
<i>that Steve made out
of tractor hubcaps.</i>

129
00:07:02,403 --> 00:07:05,270
<i>They are good dogs. Good to Dad.
And Dad is good to them.</i>

130
00:07:05,344 --> 00:07:09,116
<i>All of them are descended
from his first dog, Red Rocket.</i>

131
00:07:09,181 --> 00:07:13,072
<i>Dad never stops marveling
at the beauty of the greyhound.</i>

132
00:07:13,145 --> 00:07:15,598
<i>In fact, he doesn't even
race them for the money.</i>

133
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:19,050
<i>He reckons they are noble animals.
Skinny and sleek...</i>

134
00:07:19,123 --> 00:07:20,977
<i>and have a beautiful snout.</i>

135
00:07:21,042 --> 00:07:25,162
<i>Another thing Dad loves
is his boat. Sea Lady.</i>

136
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:28,042
<i>He cleans it every Saturday
with something else Steve built.</i>

137
00:07:28,107 --> 00:07:30,080
<i>It's a brush
with a hose in it.</i>

138
00:07:30,153 --> 00:07:32,834
<i>Dad never stops marveling
at Steve's ideas.</i>

139
00:07:32,903 --> 00:07:35,137
He's a ideas man, Steve.

140
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:37,657
<i>Steve gave it to Dad
for Father's Day.</i>

141
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:41,436
<i>That's something our family
prides itself on. Presents.</i>

142
00:07:41,503 --> 00:07:44,086
<i>Even though none of us
have a real lot of money,</i>

143
00:07:44,157 --> 00:07:46,358
<i>we love giving
each other presents.</i>

144
00:07:46,426 --> 00:07:49,490
- He got a rod and reel from Trace.
- A rod and reel.

145
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,729
- I gave him a new muzzle.
- A muzzle.

146
00:07:51,797 --> 00:07:54,129
<i>Wayne sent him an ashtray
he'd made in prison shop.</i>

147
00:07:54,195 --> 00:07:56,943
An ashtray?
But I don't smoke.

148
00:07:57,009 --> 00:08:01,794
<i>And Mum, well, Mum got him a big German
beer mug from Franklin Mint.</i>

149
00:08:01,868 --> 00:08:05,607
<i>Dad couldn't believe his eyes. It was
too good to even drink beer out of.</i>

150
00:08:05,672 --> 00:08:07,525
I'd like
to do pottery.

151
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:09,923
Oh, you should.
You'd be good at it.

152
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:13,273
This is going straight
to the poolroom.

153
00:08:13,275 --> 00:08:15,831
<i>All Dad's most prized possessions
are in the poolroom.</i>

154
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:19,289
<i>All his mementos and things
that remind him of something special.</i>

155
00:08:19,381 --> 00:08:22,230
<i>So by him saying it was going straight
to the poolroom...</i>

156
00:08:22,297 --> 00:08:24,084
<i>meant he thought
it was special.</i>

157
00:08:24,151 --> 00:08:27,280
That is a collector's item.

158
00:08:27,349 --> 00:08:30,990
This has been
the best Father's Day ever.

159
00:08:31,058 --> 00:08:32,911
<i>Of course there
were ups and downs.</i>

160
00:08:32,976 --> 00:08:35,363
<i>Wayne being in jail
was an example of a down.</i>

161
00:08:35,438 --> 00:08:38,501
<i>But, all in all,
3 Highview Crescent was a happy home.</i>

162
00:08:38,571 --> 00:08:40,479
<i>Dad called it his castle.</i>

163
00:08:40,585 --> 00:08:42,917
<i>But one day in June,</i>

164
00:08:42,983 --> 00:08:45,152
<i>a knock at the door
was to change all that.</i>

165
00:08:45,221 --> 00:08:47,074
- Yeah?
- Mr. Darryl Kerrigan?

166
00:08:47,139 --> 00:08:50,235
- Yeah?
- John Clifton.
I'm from the local council.

167
00:08:50,304 --> 00:08:52,157
- Is this about the dogs?
- No.

168
00:08:52,222 --> 00:08:54,075
- The aerial? The extensions?
- No.

169
00:08:54,141 --> 00:08:58,871
Look, if this is about
my truck on the nature strip,
I've had it out with you guys.

170
00:08:58,936 --> 00:09:02,446
No, I'm a valuer
with the local council.
I'm here to do a land valuation.

171
00:09:02,517 --> 00:09:05,383
- What for?
- Well, all properties
get valued from time to time.

172
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:08,652
So, you'd be able
to give me a value on this place?

173
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,564
- That's my job.
- That'd be good.

174
00:09:11,628 --> 00:09:15,106
- Do you want me
to show you around?
- If you wouldn't mind.

175
00:09:15,178 --> 00:09:18,558
Oh, not at all.
Be pleased to.

176
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:22,685
Because, between you and me,
I reckon the values around here are--

177
00:09:26,367 --> 00:09:29,942
As you can see,
I've put a fair bit of work into it.

178
00:09:30,012 --> 00:09:32,344
Would you like me to point out
the features as we go along?

179
00:09:32,409 --> 00:09:34,775
- If you wouldn't mind.
- You see that lace up there?

180
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,619
- Yeah?
- Fake. Plastic.

181
00:09:37,685 --> 00:09:40,999
Gives the place
a Victoriana feel.

182
00:09:41,074 --> 00:09:44,006
The chimney? Fake too.

183
00:09:44,079 --> 00:09:45,932
Why is it there?

184
00:09:45,997 --> 00:09:49,955
Charm. Adds a bit of charm.
Look at the size of that aerial.

185
00:09:50,025 --> 00:09:53,284
That's a big aerial.
What do you think? Add a bit of value?

186
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:56,162
- Hard to say. Yeah.
- Yeah.

187
00:09:56,227 --> 00:09:58,975
You can overcapitalize,
can't you?

188
00:09:59,042 --> 00:10:01,374
But it's a huge aerial.

189
00:10:06,043 --> 00:10:09,968
And this is my backyard.

190
00:10:14,163 --> 00:10:16,845
- Shuttle. From Melbourne to Sidney.

191
00:10:16,914 --> 00:10:20,227
- How close are you
to the end of the runway?
- Ah, just over the fence.

192
00:10:22,636 --> 00:10:25,481
- Is that the runway there?
- Yeah.

193
00:10:25,546 --> 00:10:28,161
- There?
- Yeah.

194
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:29,463
Beautiful machines.

195
00:10:29,773 --> 00:10:32,772
Sometimes you think
they're gonna land right on top of you.

196
00:10:33,796 --> 00:10:36,431
Freaks the dogs, though.
Greyhounds.

197
00:10:36,704 --> 00:10:38,971
Large kennel.

198
00:10:39,517 --> 00:10:42,514
Well, originally, it was a tree house
when the kids were growing up.

199
00:10:42,585 --> 00:10:44,973
I was thinking of turning it
into another room.

200
00:10:45,047 --> 00:10:46,806
- But the county said no.
- Ah.

201
00:10:46,942 --> 00:10:50,717
Now, here back, all landfill.
Not allowed to build there.

202
00:10:50,878 --> 00:10:54,156
- Has the soil been tested?
- Oh, yeah.

203
00:10:54,224 --> 00:10:57,123
Nothing too serious
in there.

204
00:10:57,197 --> 00:11:00,096
What do you know
about lead?

205
00:11:03,303 --> 00:11:06,649
Oh, this is
beautiful, darl.

206
00:11:06,724 --> 00:11:09,471
- What do you call these things again?
- Meat loaf.

207
00:11:09,537 --> 00:11:11,390
Everybody cooks
meat loaf, darl.

208
00:11:11,456 --> 00:11:13,363
Yeah, but it's
what you do with them.

209
00:11:13,438 --> 00:11:16,883
Mum reckons the trick is you
don't use minced meat.
She gets topside and crushes it.

210
00:11:16,954 --> 00:11:18,862
Is that right, darl?
Well, it shows.

211
00:11:18,936 --> 00:11:21,106
She gets silverside
and she'll crush that too.

212
00:11:21,175 --> 00:11:24,271
Dad, a guy's selling
a pair of jousting sticks.

213
00:11:24,339 --> 00:11:27,021
Jousting sticks?
What does he want for them?

214
00:11:27,089 --> 00:11:30,185
- Make us an offer.
- Darl, what do you want
with jousting sticks?

215
00:11:30,255 --> 00:11:33,154
Oh, I don't know. But I reckon they
wouldn't come up all that often.

216
00:11:33,228 --> 00:11:36,869
But they're jousting sticks.
What would anyone want
with jousting sticks?

217
00:11:36,935 --> 00:11:40,129
Well, if you get them
for half price, it's a bargain.

218
00:11:40,197 --> 00:11:42,051
- Give him a call?
- Yeah.

219
00:11:44,034 --> 00:11:47,642
I'll be interested to see
this fella's valuation.

220
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:50,359
- Are you thinking
of selling, Dad?
- Oh, no, mate, no.

221
00:11:50,428 --> 00:11:52,695
But it would be nice to know
what we're sitting on here.

222
00:11:52,762 --> 00:11:54,189
Clay.

223
00:11:54,265 --> 00:11:56,596
No, mate.
The value of the house.

224
00:11:56,662 --> 00:12:01,481
You know, it's odd, because
Farouk reckoned he had
some bloke around as well.

225
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:04,072
Must've been doing
the whole street.

226
00:12:04,143 --> 00:12:06,476
- Maybe the market's on the move.
- Here?

227
00:12:06,542 --> 00:12:08,611
Dad? Four-fifty.

228
00:12:08,683 --> 00:12:11,942
For jousting sticks?
Tell him he's dreaming.

229
00:12:12,009 --> 00:12:13,981
How much is a jousting stick worth,
Dad?

230
00:12:14,055 --> 00:12:16,866
Well, it couldn't be more
than 250.

231
00:12:16,932 --> 00:12:20,376
- Depending on the condition.
- When do we find out?

232
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:24,023
Well, we should have the official notice
in a couple of weeks.

233
00:12:24,094 --> 00:12:25,979
But just quietly,

234
00:12:26,044 --> 00:12:30,350
I reckon we could be in
for a little surprise.

235
00:12:30,455 --> 00:12:33,267
Compulsorily acquired.

236
00:12:34,772 --> 00:12:37,104
Compulsorily acquired.

237
00:12:38,608 --> 00:12:41,737
You know what this means,
don't you?

238
00:12:41,805 --> 00:12:46,470
- They're acquiring it compulsorily.
- It must be a mistake.

239
00:12:46,537 --> 00:12:49,350
They're gonna take our place,
and we don't get a say in it.

240
00:12:49,415 --> 00:12:53,601
- Well, how can they do that?
- I don't know. 70,000 bucks.

241
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:55,639
Who the hell
is Air Link?

242
00:12:55,712 --> 00:12:59,669
- Dad, a guy's selling seven coolers.
- Hang on, Steve.

243
00:12:59,741 --> 00:13:01,910
What's that?
Is this about Wayne?

244
00:13:01,979 --> 00:13:04,343
No, no. Look.

245
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:06,513
What do you make
of that?

246
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:12,559
Jesus. This is
a kick-out notice.

247
00:13:12,626 --> 00:13:16,419
I'll get it. I'll get it.

248
00:13:21,193 --> 00:13:23,678
- Ah, good day, Farouk.
- Hello, Mr. Kerrigan.

249
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,756
Can you read to me something,
please, I get today?

250
00:13:25,829 --> 00:13:28,161
Yeah, sure, mate,
but I'm a bit busy at the moment.

251
00:13:28,227 --> 00:13:31,072
Can I-- Can I come--

252
00:13:31,136 --> 00:13:34,679
- Shit. You got one too.
- Got what?

253
00:13:34,749 --> 00:13:38,062
What the hell
is going on?

254
00:13:38,137 --> 00:13:41,614
Jesus Christ.
Jack!

255
00:13:51,757 --> 00:13:54,406
Jack, it's Darryl, mate.

256
00:14:00,038 --> 00:14:03,385
Someone is going
to take me house, Darryl.

257
00:14:10,173 --> 00:14:14,097
- Mr. Kerrigan.
- Yeah. Yeah.

258
00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:18,380
Mr. Kerrigan--

259
00:14:18,454 --> 00:14:21,614
Darryl, this is
a compulsory acquisition.

260
00:14:21,683 --> 00:14:23,720
Yeah.

261
00:14:23,792 --> 00:14:27,138
Mr. Kerrigan,
the airport is expanding.

262
00:14:27,213 --> 00:14:29,893
They're setting up one of the largest
freight-handling facilities...

263
00:14:29,963 --> 00:14:33,222
in the Southern Hemisphere,
and they need a great deal of space.

264
00:14:33,288 --> 00:14:35,674
Yeah.

265
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:40,088
And your house...
is on that space.

266
00:14:40,162 --> 00:14:42,615
Yeah. Yeah,my house.

267
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:45,019
That's right. Your house.

268
00:14:45,085 --> 00:14:47,122
That's why
you'll be duly compensated.

269
00:14:47,195 --> 00:14:51,250
No. No, you've missed the point.
I'm not interested in compensation.

270
00:14:51,319 --> 00:14:53,521
I don't wanna go.

271
00:14:53,589 --> 00:14:55,660
Under the laws
of compulsory acquisition--

272
00:14:55,731 --> 00:14:59,241
and I don't necessarily
agree with those laws--

273
00:14:59,311 --> 00:15:01,698
I can understand
the pain and trouble--

274
00:15:01,774 --> 00:15:04,260
Would you stop pretending
to be on my side?

275
00:15:05,769 --> 00:15:08,320
All right, Mr. Kerrigan,
I'll state this simply.

276
00:15:08,392 --> 00:15:10,246
There is
an ironclad agreement...

277
00:15:10,311 --> 00:15:13,024
between federal, state
and local governments
and the Airports Commission.

278
00:15:13,091 --> 00:15:14,944
Yeah?

279
00:15:15,009 --> 00:15:19,228
Well, where's the agreement
with Darryl Kerrigan,
3 Highview Crescent, Coolaroo?

280
00:15:19,294 --> 00:15:22,673
Where'sthat agreement?

281
00:15:22,746 --> 00:15:26,834
It's not gonna happen.

282
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:31,315
I don't know, Darryl.
This isn't my area.

283
00:16:31,387 --> 00:16:34,451
What do you mean this is not your area?
This is law.

284
00:16:34,521 --> 00:16:36,853
Darryl, the airport
wants to buy your place.

285
00:16:36,919 --> 00:16:40,825
Airports come under federal law.
Federal? I just do small stuff.

286
00:16:40,898 --> 00:16:42,758
Conveyancing, magistrates.

287
00:16:42,824 --> 00:16:45,549
- You defended Wayne.
- Yeah, and he got eight years.

288
00:16:45,616 --> 00:16:48,942
Yeah, but you did your best.
I mean, you can hold your head up high.

289
00:16:49,018 --> 00:16:51,196
He was the one that
held up the service station.

290
00:16:51,265 --> 00:16:54,242
- I don't know anything
about this sort of stuff.
- But they can't do this.

291
00:16:54,315 --> 00:16:57,553
- I don't know. Maybe they can.
- They can't.

292
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:00,563
Look, I'll ring around
and I'll see what I can find out.

293
00:17:00,636 --> 00:17:03,197
Good on you, Dennis. Eh.

294
00:17:03,269 --> 00:17:05,128
How is Wayne?

295
00:17:05,194 --> 00:17:08,914
Good. Yeah, good.
Behaving himself.

296
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:11,192
- Any word?
- Nah, nah.

297
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:14,652
They reckon he's still
a couple of years off.

298
00:17:14,725 --> 00:17:16,837
I'll let you know.

299
00:17:16,908 --> 00:17:19,305
<i>But Dad was never one
to bring worries home.</i>

300
00:17:20,343 --> 00:17:24,512
<i>Even in the down times he'd still
tell us funny stories about his day.</i>

301
00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:28,387
It's a head-on between
a Geo and a Volksy.

302
00:17:28,462 --> 00:17:32,368
Dad also had a way
of making everyone feel important.

303
00:17:32,441 --> 00:17:35,232
Come on, Dale.
Tell 'em.

304
00:17:35,298 --> 00:17:38,887
Go on. Tell 'em.
Dale dug a hole.

305
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:41,649
- Like the time I dug a hole.
- Started the patio.

306
00:17:41,717 --> 00:17:45,372
- Good on you, Dale.
- And he'd compliment Mum every
single night on her cooking.

307
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,161
Well, hello.
How's this, boys? Whoo-hoo!

308
00:17:49,227 --> 00:17:51,624
- What do you call this?
- Chicken.

309
00:17:51,698 --> 00:17:54,839
- Yeah, but it's got something
sprinkled on it.
- Seasoning.

310
00:17:54,909 --> 00:17:56,769
Seasoning.

311
00:17:56,834 --> 00:17:59,558
Looks like everybody's
kicked a goal.

312
00:17:59,626 --> 00:18:01,486
How are our
backs feeling?

313
00:18:01,551 --> 00:18:04,595
<i>Steve did get them
ergonometric chairs.</i>

314
00:18:04,664 --> 00:18:07,355
<i>And Mum had already
started prettying hers up.</i>

315
00:18:07,425 --> 00:18:10,499
<i>Dad placed a great deal
of importance on mealtime.</i>

316
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:12,430
<i>He had
a very strict rule:</i>

317
00:18:12,495 --> 00:18:16,786
<i>When the family starts to eat,
the television is definitely
turned down.</i>

318
00:18:16,861 --> 00:18:21,095
<i>But as soon as we've finished eating,
it's a different story.</i>

319
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,820
That was great.

320
00:18:23,889 --> 00:18:26,745
Dad, 7:30.

321
00:18:26,809 --> 00:18:29,917
All right,
time for some fun.

322
00:18:29,987 --> 00:18:33,708
<i>Dad reckons there's only one show better
than Funniest Home Videos,</i>

323
00:18:33,774 --> 00:18:36,532
<i>and that's The Best
of Funniest Home Videos.</i>

324
00:18:36,598 --> 00:18:40,253
<i>It made Dad laugh. And when Dad laughed,
his whole body joined in.</i>

325
00:18:40,322 --> 00:18:42,270
<i>And then we would too.</i>

326
00:18:42,343 --> 00:18:44,520
Doggy breath!

327
00:18:44,588 --> 00:18:49,076
<i>It was funny how on the fun nights,
part of me got sad,</i>

328
00:18:49,146 --> 00:18:52,352
<i>'cause I'd think about
my big brother in prison
and wonder what he was doing.</i>

329
00:18:53,864 --> 00:18:56,260
<i>Wayne always reckoned
he was doing fine,</i>

330
00:18:56,337 --> 00:19:00,539
<i>but I get the feeling
he was missing us more
than he was letting on.</i>

331
00:19:00,604 --> 00:19:03,165
<i>It'll be great
when he comes home.</i>

332
00:19:10,617 --> 00:19:12,730
You're a ripper, Dennis.

333
00:19:12,801 --> 00:19:17,035
I said you're
a bloody ripper!

334
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:20,493
Yeah, okay.

335
00:19:20,567 --> 00:19:24,604
- That's it, Sal. All fixed.
- What did he say?

336
00:19:24,674 --> 00:19:29,357
He said I have recourse
to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.

337
00:19:29,426 --> 00:19:32,751
All I gotta do is run
up there, put my case,
and they can go and get stuffed.

338
00:19:32,828 --> 00:19:34,688
Good on you, darl.

339
00:19:34,753 --> 00:19:37,511
- He still hasn't noticed, Mum.
- What?

340
00:19:37,577 --> 00:19:41,297
- Oh, it's finished.
- Today.

341
00:19:41,365 --> 00:19:44,373
How is that?
You should open a shop.

342
00:19:44,444 --> 00:19:48,133
Dad, some guy's selling
an overhead projector.

343
00:19:48,201 --> 00:19:50,061
Nah--

344
00:19:50,126 --> 00:19:52,949
Nah, hang on, Steve.
What's he asking?

345
00:19:53,014 --> 00:19:56,319
- One-fifty.
- Tell him he's dreaming.

346
00:19:56,384 --> 00:19:59,623
- Yeah.
- So what else
did Dennis have to say?

347
00:19:59,689 --> 00:20:02,599
- Nothing. It's fixed.
- Yeah, but when's the hearing?

348
00:20:02,675 --> 00:20:05,171
Monday. And I know exactly
what I'm gonna say.

349
00:20:05,242 --> 00:20:08,700
- Don't babble on, darl.
- I don't babble on.
When do I babble on?

350
00:20:08,773 --> 00:20:11,497
- You do babble on.
- All right.

351
00:20:11,565 --> 00:20:14,387
But I tell you
what we're gonna do.

352
00:20:14,453 --> 00:20:17,080
Friday we're gonna
pick up Trace and Con,

353
00:20:17,149 --> 00:20:21,154
and then we're going straight up
to Bonnie Doon for the weekend.

354
00:20:21,225 --> 00:20:25,394
And we're not worrying about
those clowns for another second.

355
00:20:25,462 --> 00:20:29,248
- Mum! Price is Right'son.
- All right, eh.

356
00:20:29,313 --> 00:20:33,099
I'd better ring up Farouk and Jack
and Evonne and the others...

357
00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:36,207
and tell 'em
what's going on.

358
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:45,999
<i>Trace and Con had
a great honeymoon in Thailand.</i>

359
00:20:46,066 --> 00:20:48,889
<i>We met them as they came off
the plane with a baggage cart,</i>

360
00:20:48,954 --> 00:20:51,777
<i>which was lucky 'cause
they had heaps of stuff.</i>

361
00:20:53,768 --> 00:20:56,974
<i>We couldn't wait to hear all
the stories about their trip,</i>

362
00:20:57,042 --> 00:20:59,384
<i>and we didn't have
to wait all that long either.</i>

363
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:02,174
<i>'Cause one of the good things
about living next to the airport...</i>

364
00:21:02,241 --> 00:21:04,582
<i>is that it doesn't
take long to walk home.</i>

365
00:21:14,823 --> 00:21:17,996
And they had these masks
which you put over your eyes
when you're sleeping...

366
00:21:18,064 --> 00:21:19,924
so that you can't
see anything.

367
00:21:19,989 --> 00:21:22,330
- And they were complimentary.
- Yeah, they were for free.

368
00:21:22,397 --> 00:21:24,376
<i>It was the first time
anyone in our family...</i>

369
00:21:24,451 --> 00:21:26,311
<i>had traveled
outside the county.</i>

370
00:21:26,377 --> 00:21:28,554
<i>And we just sat glued
listening to all the details.</i>

371
00:21:28,623 --> 00:21:31,248
Oh, Mum, we had a choice between fish
and Beef Wellington.

372
00:21:31,318 --> 00:21:34,010
- Beef Wellington?
- What's that, darl?

373
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,289
It's beef
done in pastry.

374
00:21:36,357 --> 00:21:38,885
And it was an absolute
credit to the airline.

375
00:21:38,957 --> 00:21:40,818
- Did they show a film?
- Two.

376
00:21:40,884 --> 00:21:42,744
- Two?
- Yeah.

377
00:21:42,809 --> 00:21:44,855
- And they also had--
- What were they?

378
00:21:44,927 --> 00:21:47,936
- We saw Twister. And they had--
- Was it on a screen or a telly?

379
00:21:48,007 --> 00:21:51,913
Telly. And they had
easy listening, classic gold,
contemporary rock, world--

380
00:21:51,987 --> 00:21:54,165
What was the other one,
the other film?

381
00:21:54,234 --> 00:21:56,575
- Uh,Juman-- Jumanji, yeah.
-Jumanji.

382
00:21:56,791 --> 00:21:59,559
- And with the headphones--
- Which one was first?

383
00:21:59,624 --> 00:22:01,946
- Twister. You could
turn the sound all--
- How many on the way back?

384
00:22:02,012 --> 00:22:04,813
- Dale! You can ask all this later.
- Sorry, Trace.

385
00:22:04,878 --> 00:22:07,895
It was so dry in the plane
that your hair actually dehydrates.

386
00:22:07,966 --> 00:22:11,839
- Doesn't it, Con?
- It loses its moisture.
- It's so interesting.

387
00:22:11,914 --> 00:22:13,489
<i>We could have
listened for hours,</i>

388
00:22:14,067 --> 00:22:15,728
<i>but then it
was presents time.</i>

389
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:18,889
For you, Dad. It's a samurai sword
letter opener.

390
00:22:18,963 --> 00:22:20,992
That is handcrafted.

391
00:22:21,064 --> 00:22:24,592
How's that, love?
That is just--

392
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:27,038
This is going straight
to the poolroom.

393
00:22:27,112 --> 00:22:29,305
You should use it, Dad.

394
00:22:29,374 --> 00:22:32,325
This I am not even taking
out of the wrapper.

395
00:22:32,398 --> 00:22:36,847
<i>They bought Mum a genuine Rolex
for 15 bucks off a guy at the beach.</i>

396
00:22:36,919 --> 00:22:39,047
<i>He said he'd mail
the warranty later.</i>

397
00:22:39,115 --> 00:22:43,218
<i>I got a necklace with a shark tooth.
They got a Walkman for Steve.</i>

398
00:22:43,286 --> 00:22:46,565
<i>'Cause it was Friday,
I told Trace I'd take
Wayne's present to him.</i>

399
00:22:46,629 --> 00:22:49,580
<i>It was an elephant,
'cause elephants bring good luck,</i>

400
00:22:49,653 --> 00:22:52,257
<i>especially if the trunks are up,
and his trunk was up.</i>

401
00:22:53,283 --> 00:22:56,018
<i>It really made Wayne's day.</i>

402
00:22:56,084 --> 00:22:58,819
- She's great, isn't she? Trace.
- Yeah.

403
00:22:58,885 --> 00:23:02,184
It brings good luck.
She's coming in on Monday.

404
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:04,833
Great. And when's Dad going in
to do that hearing?

405
00:23:04,903 --> 00:23:06,749
- On Monday.
- Yeah?

406
00:23:06,813 --> 00:23:11,198
- Yeah. He reckons they can't do it.
- Dad would know.

407
00:23:11,271 --> 00:23:15,340
- You going up to
Bonnie Doon tonight?
- Yeah. Maybe. I don't know.

408
00:23:15,409 --> 00:23:18,589
<i>I didn't want to tell Wayne
that we were going to Bonnie Doon,</i>

409
00:23:18,655 --> 00:23:21,456
<i>just in case he'd feel bad
that we were going to Bonnie Doon.</i>

410
00:23:21,521 --> 00:23:25,069
<i>He liked it there.
We all liked it there.</i>

411
00:23:25,204 --> 00:23:28,013
* We're going to Bonnie Doon *

412
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:30,967
<i>We all left soon after,
except for Trace and Con.</i>

413
00:23:31,041 --> 00:23:34,502
<i>As you can just imagine,
they were just married and
wanted some time to themselves.</i>

414
00:23:34,574 --> 00:23:36,734
<i>So they drove up
in their own car.</i>

415
00:23:36,803 --> 00:23:39,537
<i>Dad had a song he used to sing
about going to Bonnie Doon.</i>

416
00:23:39,604 --> 00:23:42,556
<i>Only he sang it a lot,
and it was a bit repetitive.</i>

417
00:23:42,628 --> 00:23:44,473
Darl!

418
00:23:50,184 --> 00:23:52,821
- Dad, radar!

419
00:23:59,873 --> 00:24:02,205
- How much did that cost?
- Seventy bucks.

420
00:24:02,337 --> 00:24:04,651
Just paid for itself.

421
00:24:06,529 --> 00:24:09,069
Dale, why don't you
unload the boat, Mate?

422
00:24:09,221 --> 00:24:12,139
Steve, don't forget
the dog food, pal.

423
00:24:16,566 --> 00:24:19,963
Hey, boy. Hey!

424
00:24:20,036 --> 00:24:24,552
- Bloody marvelous to be
up here, isn't it, Dale?
- Yeah.

425
00:24:24,619 --> 00:24:27,583
- Bonnie Doon.
- Dad loved Bonnie Doon.

426
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,852
<i>How do I describe it?</i>

427
00:24:29,063 --> 00:24:31,256
<i>It is a little town
on a big lake.</i>

428
00:24:31,324 --> 00:24:35,840
<i>It's a beautiful place,
especially this time of year
when the water levels are down.</i>

429
00:24:35,909 --> 00:24:38,481
<i>Dad could not believe his luck
when he found this place.</i>

430
00:24:38,551 --> 00:24:40,875
<i>It was a bargain,
and he couldn't work out why.</i>

431
00:24:40,939 --> 00:24:43,826
<i>It was just a block of land
with a beautiful view.</i>

432
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:46,570
<i>It took him five years
to build this place.</i>

433
00:24:46,638 --> 00:24:49,210
<i>He bought an unfinished kit home
out of the Trading Post,</i>

434
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:52,579
<i>built it in the backyard
and towed it up here with his truck.</i>

435
00:24:52,655 --> 00:24:54,977
<i>He was the only bloke
he knew with a holiday home.</i>

436
00:24:55,043 --> 00:24:57,105
<i>Not a mobile home,
a holiday home.</i>

437
00:24:57,175 --> 00:24:59,650
<i>And he reckoned we were
the luckiest family in the world.</i>

438
00:24:59,722 --> 00:25:04,248
- Dale, I reckon we're the luckiest
family in the world. - Yeah.

439
00:25:04,249 --> 00:25:05,291
<i>He loved the serenity of the place.</i>

440
00:25:05,357 --> 00:25:07,296
How's the serenity?

441
00:25:07,435 --> 00:25:09,544
<i>I think he also just loved the word.</i>

442
00:25:09,673 --> 00:25:11,797
So much serenity.

443
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:17,199
Let's get to bed.
Tomorrow is going to be a great day.

444
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:17,931
Yeah.

445
00:25:21,166 --> 00:25:23,609
<i>If there's one thing
Dad loved more than serenity,</i>

446
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:26,156
<i>it was an outboard motor
on full throttle.</i>

447
00:25:32,944 --> 00:25:36,343
Listen to that!
Singing like a bird!

448
00:25:36,414 --> 00:25:39,684
<i>He just loved Bonnie Doon,
and he reckoned the faster you went,</i>

449
00:25:39,684 --> 00:25:40,918
<i>the more you saw of it.</i>

450
00:25:40,975 --> 00:25:41,919
Look at that!

451
00:25:42,487 --> 00:25:45,538
- What?
- Back there.

452
00:25:45,539 --> 00:25:49,616
<i>But eventually he found a place
he reckoned looked like a good spot.</i>

453
00:25:49,617 --> 00:25:52,006
I reckon this looks like a good spot.

454
00:25:53,069 --> 00:25:56,047
<i>Dad loved fishing. And he really
looked after his equipment.</i>

455
00:25:56,460 --> 00:26:00,021
<i>He said they only made on good rod,
it's called the 'ugly stick'.</i>

456
00:26:00,166 --> 00:26:04,285
<i>It's so strong, you can bend it
right around on itself.</i>

457
00:26:04,286 --> 00:26:07,584
Look at that.
Bends right around itself.

458
00:26:08,988 --> 00:26:11,636
<i>The lake had trout,
redfin and carp.</i>

459
00:26:11,707 --> 00:26:14,575
<i>The carp was not a good eating fish,
but it was good catching.</i>

460
00:26:14,575 --> 00:26:16,484
<i>They could grow
to quite a size.</i>

461
00:26:16,485 --> 00:26:19,860
<i>Genuinely, that just hooked himself.
But occasionally Dad went crafty.</i>

462
00:26:21,462 --> 00:26:22,662
- Got a nibble.

463
00:26:23,032 --> 00:26:27,100
<i>Dad reckoned that fishing
was 10 percent brains
and 95 percent muscle...</i>

464
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:29,340
<i>and the rest
was just good luck.</i>

465
00:26:31,733 --> 00:26:35,996
<i>We pulled off a few carp that day.
And each of us had a muscle ache.</i>

466
00:26:40,295 --> 00:26:42,496
- Where's Con?
- Down the shops.

467
00:26:42,996 --> 00:26:44,609
You and Con talked about kids, yet?

468
00:26:45,311 --> 00:26:47,531
Yeah, Con wants to start
straight away.

469
00:26:47,532 --> 00:26:49,153
But, you know,
I've got a career.

470
00:26:49,154 --> 00:26:50,343
Of course.

471
00:26:50,344 --> 00:26:53,005
So, I said I'm not having kids
until I'm at least 23.

472
00:26:53,006 --> 00:26:54,868
Times have changed.

473
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:11,235
- Gale had a boy.
- Was he a whopper?

474
00:27:11,236 --> 00:27:14,233
10 pounds. They got to be
a big beefy family.

475
00:27:14,234 --> 00:27:18,472
Tyler Jake. Even the birth notice
was beef. Stork and everything.

476
00:27:18,473 --> 00:27:20,891
Shannon was 9 pounds.
Would you mind then?

477
00:27:20,892 --> 00:27:23,720
Uh, I needed a pair of booties.
You always liked booties.

478
00:27:24,306 --> 00:27:26,891
- I reckon you should make
faked flowers. - Uh, yeah.

479
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:28,939
- Jenny makes fake flowers.
- Jenny?

480
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:30,159
- Yeah.
- Jenny Jenny?

481
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,317
No, Malcoway Jenny. She reckons
the trick is to make 'em real

482
00:27:32,318 --> 00:27:35,208
but not too real. Just real enough
to know that they're fake.

483
00:27:36,082 --> 00:27:38,856
- I'd like to do pottery.
- Wow, on a wheel?

484
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:41,363
Yeah. I just love mugs.

485
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:43,946
Yeah, I'd like
to make my own mugs.

486
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:46,676
- Mum?
- Yeah?

487
00:27:46,925 --> 00:27:48,237
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

488
00:27:49,272 --> 00:27:50,432
- You worried about the house?
- No.

489
00:27:50,499 --> 00:27:55,099
- Well, Dad said everything's
going to be okay.
- Of course it is, darl.

490
00:28:00,584 --> 00:28:03,680
We ended up
with four carp and one redfin.

491
00:28:03,749 --> 00:28:08,185
A reasonable day's fishing,
considering we had to get back
earlier when Coco got seasick.

492
00:28:08,258 --> 00:28:10,808
Steve wasn't looking
all that good either.

493
00:28:15,707 --> 00:28:18,519
Keep it still, Trace.

494
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:22,163
Disciplined,
isn't he, Sal?

495
00:28:24,339 --> 00:28:28,111
Here are you and I relaxing,
having a beer, and he's still training.

496
00:28:28,176 --> 00:28:30,563
Yeah, he just loves
that sport.

497
00:28:30,637 --> 00:28:34,147
- Well, you gotta have
a passion for something.
- Yeah.

498
00:28:36,966 --> 00:28:40,063
Ours is serenity.

499
00:28:42,466 --> 00:28:45,812
Dad, where do you want me to put
the chicken coop?

500
00:28:45,887 --> 00:28:48,307
Out the back, Steve.

501
00:28:50,684 --> 00:28:54,128
Forty-five bucks. You couldn't buy
the materials for that.

502
00:28:54,199 --> 00:28:57,066
Now, what do you want
with a chicken coop?

503
00:28:57,142 --> 00:28:59,473
And what do we want
with a kit home?

504
00:28:59,538 --> 00:29:02,983
Oh, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah.

505
00:29:03,056 --> 00:29:06,282
Now, give me a kiss,
you big hunk of a man.

506
00:29:40,042 --> 00:29:44,006
Marvellous, ain't it?
The lake, the kids.

507
00:29:48,037 --> 00:29:51,327
Oh, look at the dogs.
Don't they love it?

508
00:29:54,276 --> 00:29:56,156
Oh, smell that.

509
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:59,512
- Diesel.
- Yep.

510
00:30:01,712 --> 00:30:03,980
Pity Wayne can't be here.

511
00:30:04,046 --> 00:30:07,490
- Darl.
- No, no, I could've done better.

512
00:30:09,001 --> 00:30:12,478
Well, let's start
cooking this feast.

513
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:15,416
- Who ordered medium rare?
- Me.

514
00:30:15,492 --> 00:30:17,345
Good stuff.

515
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:20,025
Check that, Steve.
It could be a little underdone.

516
00:30:20,094 --> 00:30:24,434
- I bet they don't have places
like this in Thailand, Con.
- No, Mr. Kerrigan.

517
00:30:24,507 --> 00:30:27,352
Hey, hey, hey.
"Darryl" now, mate.

518
00:30:27,416 --> 00:30:29,618
Sorry, Darryl.

519
00:30:29,686 --> 00:30:33,392
- It's a good place, though.
- Yeah, yeah, I'm curious.

520
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:37,710
Now, I know it's unfair
to compare anyplace to Bonnie Doon,

521
00:30:37,775 --> 00:30:40,107
but why would I want to go there
instead of here?

522
00:30:40,173 --> 00:30:42,985
- It's for young people, Dad.
- I know that, Trace.

523
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:46,560
- It's the culture, Darryl.
The place is full of culture.
- Chockers.

524
00:30:46,631 --> 00:30:48,484
- Oh, yeah.
- Something for everyone.

525
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:50,719
- What was that movie again, Con?
- Dale.

526
00:30:50,787 --> 00:30:52,640
There were so many stories.

527
00:30:52,705 --> 00:30:55,038
At the hotel
Trace and I were staying in,
they had this one channel:

528
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:57,523
kickboxing, 24 hours a day.

529
00:30:58,393 --> 00:31:01,485
It was just so interesting
to hear about another county.

530
00:31:01,486 --> 00:31:04,647
Meals were 5 dollars, mum.
The most beautiful sadeys(?).

531
00:31:04,648 --> 00:31:05,445
What's that, darl?

532
00:31:05,446 --> 00:31:08,786
It's meat on skew with
peanut sauce and wheat.

533
00:31:08,798 --> 00:31:11,381
And the stories
went on and on all night.

534
00:31:11,531 --> 00:31:14,756
The value for money is
absolutely second to none.

535
00:31:14,757 --> 00:31:17,296
- One of the other Sony Walkmans.
- With presets?

536
00:31:17,297 --> 00:31:21,466
Yeah, presets and megabytes.
$85 dollars Australian.

537
00:31:21,797 --> 00:31:23,495
- Wow.
- Bargain?

538
00:31:24,888 --> 00:31:27,674
But I reckon someone like you, Steve,
could have got it down even further.

539
00:31:28,721 --> 00:31:30,596
I can't wait to get a beer and coffee.

540
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:34,251
- It's great to have you two back.
- It's great to be back.

541
00:31:34,742 --> 00:31:37,130
Great to be up here.

542
00:31:37,204 --> 00:31:40,911
They haven't got
a place like this in Bangkok.

543
00:31:40,977 --> 00:31:43,276
How's the serenity?

544
00:31:44,878 --> 00:31:46,731
Not a sound.

545
00:31:58,881 --> 00:32:01,944
- Feeling good, Sal.
- Good on you, darl.

546
00:32:02,014 --> 00:32:04,183
Steve, could you move
the Corolla?

547
00:32:04,252 --> 00:32:06,584
I need to get to the Torana out
so I can get to the Commodore.

548
00:32:06,650 --> 00:32:08,982
I'll have to get the keys
to the Cortina if I'm going
to move that Corolla.

549
00:32:09,047 --> 00:32:11,379
- Watch the boat, mate.
- Yeah.

550
00:32:11,446 --> 00:32:13,865
- Know why I'm feeling good, Sal?
- Why?

551
00:32:13,939 --> 00:32:17,710
I'll tell you why.
Because this is an example
of the individual.

552
00:32:17,775 --> 00:32:20,424
Of how the individual,
if he has the guts to stand up...

553
00:32:20,494 --> 00:32:23,687
and shove it right up
those people who think
they can stand on top of you.

554
00:32:23,754 --> 00:32:26,980
The people who think
they can do that, that's why.

555
00:32:32,163 --> 00:32:34,103
What do you mean
what's my plea?

556
00:32:34,353 --> 00:32:36,587
- What is the case you are putting?
- I told you.

557
00:32:36,655 --> 00:32:39,685
I mean, you just can't walk in
and take a man's house.

558
00:32:39,756 --> 00:32:42,568
Mr. Kerrigan, are you disputing
the amount of compensation?

559
00:32:42,633 --> 00:32:47,298
I'm not interested in compensation.
I'm saying that you can't kick me out.

560
00:32:47,364 --> 00:32:49,566
Very well.

561
00:32:49,635 --> 00:32:51,999
- What is your argument?
- That's it.

562
00:32:52,064 --> 00:32:55,739
That's my argument.
You can't kick me out.

563
00:32:55,805 --> 00:32:59,631
And on what law do you base
that argument?

564
00:32:59,706 --> 00:33:03,118
- The law
of bloody common sense!
- Mr. Kerrigan.

565
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:06,635
- I must ask you
to restrain yourself.
- Yeah, all right.

566
00:33:06,707 --> 00:33:10,959
Mr. Kerrigan, this is
the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.

567
00:33:11,024 --> 00:33:14,217
You are an applicant.
You need to show--

568
00:33:14,284 --> 00:33:17,859
I need to show?
So it's up to me, is it?

569
00:33:17,929 --> 00:33:21,439
Mr. Kerrigan, Air Link,
as a federal authority,

570
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:24,093
has the right to purchase property
compulsorily.

571
00:33:24,164 --> 00:33:28,763
And, as far as I can see,
you have offered no evidence
to refute that right.

572
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:30,772
No evidence?

573
00:33:30,845 --> 00:33:35,315
It's not a house. It's a home.
A man's home is his castle.

574
00:33:35,385 --> 00:33:40,138
I mean, it's-- it's--
it's Jack's castle.
It's Farou-Farouk's castle.

575
00:33:40,212 --> 00:33:42,480
You just can't walk in
and steal our homes.

576
00:33:42,547 --> 00:33:45,359
- You will be compensated.
- I don't wanna be compensated.

577
00:33:45,424 --> 00:33:47,756
You can't buy
what I've got.

578
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:52,553
Mr. Kerrigan, I am rapidly
running out of patience.

579
00:33:52,618 --> 00:33:56,128
- You're running out of patience.
- What is your case in law?

580
00:33:58,117 --> 00:34:00,449
Well, okay, um,

581
00:34:00,514 --> 00:34:05,430
the law is supposed
to be about justice-- no, fairness.

582
00:34:05,502 --> 00:34:10,450
And I know that sometimes
what is right and fair is
not clear-cut. It's a bit iffy.

583
00:34:10,522 --> 00:34:15,372
But this is not iffy.
I mean, this is as clear as day.

584
00:34:15,444 --> 00:34:20,393
It is right and fair
that a family be allowed
to live in its own house.

585
00:34:20,464 --> 00:34:22,764
That is justice.

586
00:34:24,269 --> 00:34:26,755
I rest my case.

587
00:34:28,872 --> 00:34:32,513
<i>Dad reckoned he'd nailed it.
Farouk agreed.</i>

588
00:34:35,202 --> 00:34:37,753
<i>But Dad was wrong.</i>

589
00:34:37,825 --> 00:34:42,610
I can't believe I lost.
I've let you down.

590
00:34:42,684 --> 00:34:45,976
No, no, Mr. Kerrigan.
You do good job.

591
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:49,104
- Please, Farouk, call me Darryl.
- Okay, Mr. Darryl.

592
00:34:49,174 --> 00:34:52,170
But, you know, I never heard that one
you say before.

593
00:34:52,243 --> 00:34:55,403
"A man's home is his castle."
Well, that's an old saying.

594
00:34:55,472 --> 00:34:59,658
No, no. Other one. Other one.
"Is not house, is home."

595
00:34:59,724 --> 00:35:02,657
Farouk, I lost.

596
00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:05,248
I know, Mr. Darryl.

597
00:35:05,319 --> 00:35:07,837
Farouk, how much
are they paying you?

598
00:35:07,909 --> 00:35:10,972
- $65,000.
- For your place?

599
00:35:11,042 --> 00:35:15,261
Yes. They say the plane,
they fly overhead, drop the value.

600
00:35:15,326 --> 00:35:19,152
I don't care. In Beirut,
plane fly overhead, drop bomb.

601
00:35:19,227 --> 00:35:23,282
- I like this plane.
- What are we going to do, Darryl?

602
00:35:23,351 --> 00:35:25,236
I don't know, Jack.

603
00:35:25,302 --> 00:35:29,008
This is the only place I can afford.
I don't wanna move.

604
00:35:29,074 --> 00:35:30,927
You see what
they're doing, Sal?

605
00:35:30,992 --> 00:35:33,063
Mm.

606
00:35:33,133 --> 00:35:36,643
- How long you lived here, Jack?
- Three years.

607
00:35:36,714 --> 00:35:40,126
Now, in the area.
How long have you lived around here?

608
00:35:40,199 --> 00:35:42,205
Fifty-seven years.

609
00:35:42,278 --> 00:35:45,657
Fifty-seven years.

610
00:35:45,730 --> 00:35:49,786
And they're gonna
kick you out on your ass.

611
00:35:49,855 --> 00:35:54,041
Well, bugger 'em.
I'm not giving up, Jack.

612
00:35:54,107 --> 00:35:58,359
If they wanna play things by the law,
fine. We'll play by the law.

613
00:35:58,423 --> 00:36:01,268
But they're not
the only big guns in town.

614
00:36:01,333 --> 00:36:05,606
If it's gonna be lawyers, I'm gonna
hit them with the big artillery.

615
00:36:05,712 --> 00:36:09,986
Hang on, Darryl.
Jesus, these fucking photocopiers.

616
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:12,873
What the fuck is that?
I cleared tray three.

617
00:36:12,938 --> 00:36:14,791
Why don't you get your girl
to do that for you?

618
00:36:14,856 --> 00:36:18,845
She's not here on Mondays.
She does Tuesday, Thursday, Friday.

619
00:36:18,916 --> 00:36:21,564
F-3. What the fuck
is that?

620
00:36:21,634 --> 00:36:23,771
- Dennis, how did it go?
- Not good.

621
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:27,611
I spoke to every barrister I know.
No one wants to touch it.

622
00:36:27,676 --> 00:36:29,911
All right. You do it.

623
00:36:29,977 --> 00:36:32,365
I told you, Darryl,
I'm not qualified.

624
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:35,699
You're not qualified?
Now I've heard everything.

625
00:36:35,766 --> 00:36:37,835
What do you mean
you're not qualified?

626
00:36:37,907 --> 00:36:40,174
I mean I'm not
in the big time.

627
00:36:40,241 --> 00:36:42,148
You have lost faith
in yourself, Dennis.

628
00:36:42,224 --> 00:36:44,904
- Darryl--
- You have lost faith.

629
00:36:44,972 --> 00:36:48,766
Darryl, it's over my head.
It's over your head too.

630
00:36:48,841 --> 00:36:52,612
Over my head? Dennis.

631
00:36:52,678 --> 00:36:55,675
- Darryl, have you heard
of the Barlow Group?
-No.

632
00:36:55,747 --> 00:36:59,127
It's basically a big investment company
controlled by three blokes...

633
00:36:59,199 --> 00:37:01,052
worth about
a half a billion each.

634
00:37:01,117 --> 00:37:03,570
Well, the Barlow Group
is Air Link.

635
00:37:03,643 --> 00:37:05,780
I thought Air Link
was the government.

636
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:09,807
It's a government authority,
but all the money's coming from Barlow.

637
00:37:09,877 --> 00:37:14,282
It's a way of privatizing
without privatizing.
Anyway, it's a big, big thing.

638
00:37:14,354 --> 00:37:17,220
Every level of government.
Huge investment.

639
00:37:18,254 --> 00:37:20,292
All right, fine.
So they're big.

640
00:37:20,364 --> 00:37:22,272
But why do they
wantmy house?

641
00:37:22,346 --> 00:37:25,605
Why don't they just fill in
the old quarry and build it there?

642
00:37:25,671 --> 00:37:28,570
I don't know. Maybe it's just cheaper
to pull down more houses.

643
00:37:28,645 --> 00:37:33,147
- So we fight 'em.
- Darryl, they want this thing to work.

644
00:37:33,217 --> 00:37:37,970
- They're gonna get their way.
- And you know why people
like that get their way?

645
00:37:38,044 --> 00:37:41,337
Because people like us
don't stand up to 'em.

646
00:37:41,401 --> 00:37:43,504
Now, they've still
gotta play by the rules.

647
00:37:43,575 --> 00:37:47,401
Darryl, they write the rules.
They own the game.

648
00:37:47,475 --> 00:37:51,246
Fuck, Dennis. It's my fucking house.
You're not gonna run scared on me.

649
00:37:52,622 --> 00:37:54,858
I can't do this by myself.

650
00:37:54,925 --> 00:37:57,606
All right, mate.

651
00:37:57,674 --> 00:38:00,290
Let me think about it.

652
00:38:04,835 --> 00:38:08,891
- Con's working late tonight.
- He's just so busy.

653
00:38:08,961 --> 00:38:11,773
I cannot believe
this postcard arrived today.

654
00:38:11,838 --> 00:38:13,843
Thanks
for dropping in.

655
00:38:13,916 --> 00:38:15,920
How's he treating
my princess?

656
00:38:15,993 --> 00:38:17,846
Dad!

657
00:38:17,912 --> 00:38:20,626
All right,
all right.

658
00:38:20,693 --> 00:38:23,560
You saw
some amazing things.

659
00:38:23,635 --> 00:38:26,186
Now, that is
a bloody big statue.

660
00:38:26,256 --> 00:38:29,385
- Yeah, and it's all made of gold.
- Is that so?

661
00:38:31,724 --> 00:38:34,023
This bloke's
gonna win the cars.

662
00:38:34,090 --> 00:38:37,250
- How's the salon?
- Good.

663
00:38:37,319 --> 00:38:39,172
And look at these models.

664
00:38:39,237 --> 00:38:43,488
They've got ripper bodies,
but they let themselves down
in the hair department.

665
00:38:43,552 --> 00:38:47,258
You ought to contact
Channel Nine, get
a contract with them.

666
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:49,428
Dad, it doesn't work
like that.

667
00:38:49,498 --> 00:38:53,870
Well, look at them and look at you.
Now, that is a head of hair.

668
00:38:53,943 --> 00:38:56,755
- Just beautiful.
- Thanks, Dad.

669
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:58,760
I'm only stating
the truth.

670
00:38:58,835 --> 00:39:01,484
Dad, what's a pulpit?

671
00:39:01,552 --> 00:39:05,706
Where the minister gives
his sermon from. How much?

672
00:39:05,772 --> 00:39:09,413
- Eight hundred.
- Dreaming.

673
00:39:09,481 --> 00:39:12,610
Actually, I know how
to get you on there.

674
00:39:12,678 --> 00:39:16,700
- Send in a photo of you
for the home viewers.
- Dad, if you dare.

675
00:39:16,770 --> 00:39:20,215
- Oh, I've got quite a few lying around.
- Dad!

676
00:39:20,287 --> 00:39:23,765
Actually, I think I've got one taken
when you were two...

677
00:39:23,836 --> 00:39:25,688
and you didn't have
any clothes on.

678
00:39:25,753 --> 00:39:27,606
Dad! Don't you--

679
00:39:27,672 --> 00:39:30,386
- Quite a few to choose from there.
- Don't-- No!

680
00:39:34,770 --> 00:39:37,834
<i>That night I thought of Wayne again.</i>

681
00:39:37,903 --> 00:39:41,282
<i>I wondered what he was doing
and whether the elephant's
trunk was still up.</i>

682
00:39:41,356 --> 00:39:43,209
<i>'Cause that
brings good luck.</i>

683
00:39:56,415 --> 00:39:58,268
So, in conclusion,

684
00:39:58,333 --> 00:40:01,810
my client will be appealing the decision
to the federal court...

685
00:40:01,882 --> 00:40:06,101
and, as an interim, will
be seeking an injunction...

686
00:40:06,166 --> 00:40:09,774
to stop any further action
in this matter.

687
00:40:09,842 --> 00:40:12,654
Sincerely, Dennis Denuto.

688
00:40:43,316 --> 00:40:45,769
Hammersley and Laycock.
May I help you?

689
00:40:45,841 --> 00:40:47,880
Yes, putting you through now.

690
00:40:52,075 --> 00:40:56,294
I'm afraid he can't come
to the phone right now, Farouk.
He's up in the ceiling.

691
00:40:56,359 --> 00:41:01,177
All right, I'll get him
to give you a call
as soon as he comes down.

692
00:41:01,251 --> 00:41:04,826
Okay. Oh, give my love to Taboulah.

693
00:41:04,895 --> 00:41:06,835
- Good-bye.
- Shit!

694
00:41:07,868 --> 00:41:10,103
Steve!

695
00:41:10,171 --> 00:41:13,071
- Yeah?
- The beams aren't supporting.

696
00:41:13,144 --> 00:41:16,556
- I reckon we put a hold
on the mezzanine.
- Yeah, all right.

697
00:41:16,629 --> 00:41:21,229
But I'll have to give that guy a
call about the spiral staircase
'cause he's holding it for us.

698
00:41:21,297 --> 00:41:24,392
- Darl, can you give Farouk a ring?
- Yeah.

699
00:41:24,462 --> 00:41:27,395
- Where's Dad?
- Up in the roof.

700
00:41:27,467 --> 00:41:30,181
- Dad!
- Yeah, mate?

701
00:41:30,249 --> 00:41:35,329
I dug another hole.
It's filling with water.

702
00:41:50,344 --> 00:41:55,161
You are fucking kidding me.
I cleared that tray three fucking times!

703
00:41:55,235 --> 00:41:57,405
- Mr. Denuto.
- Yeah?

704
00:41:57,473 --> 00:42:00,318
Ron Graham, Hammersley and Laycock.
Got your note during the week.

705
00:42:00,382 --> 00:42:05,332
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
Um, sit down.

706
00:42:08,727 --> 00:42:12,335
Now, the Kerrigan matter.

707
00:42:13,714 --> 00:42:16,362
Well, we're going
to be taking it further.

708
00:42:16,432 --> 00:42:20,868
Yes, we totally understand,
and we're here on behalf
of our client to apologize.

709
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:23,011
- We made a mistake.
- You have?

710
00:42:23,081 --> 00:42:27,682
Yes, it appears that the house
belonging to Mr. Kerrigan was
grossly undervalued by mistake,

711
00:42:27,749 --> 00:42:29,984
and our client would like
to rectify the situation.

712
00:42:30,051 --> 00:42:33,909
- Well, what are you offering?
- Another $25,000.

713
00:42:33,983 --> 00:42:36,370
- Whoa.
- As a separate cash check.

714
00:42:36,445 --> 00:42:39,573
You know, Darryl, my client,

715
00:42:39,642 --> 00:42:42,836
is disputing
the compulsory purchase.

716
00:42:42,904 --> 00:42:45,454
Yes, though with
the correct valuation,

717
00:42:45,526 --> 00:42:47,695
we thought this may put
the dispute to rest.

718
00:42:47,763 --> 00:42:49,735
What if it doesn't?

719
00:42:50,992 --> 00:42:52,845
If I were you,

720
00:42:52,910 --> 00:42:55,625
I would advise Mr. Kerrigan
against taking any further action.

721
00:42:55,692 --> 00:42:57,697
This is
a multi-billion dollar project.

722
00:42:57,770 --> 00:43:00,189
It's been in planning
for a long time.

723
00:43:00,264 --> 00:43:04,537
If this action were to delay
or spoil the plans,

724
00:43:04,613 --> 00:43:08,635
the understandable anger
could well spill into something else.

725
00:43:08,704 --> 00:43:11,319
- Are you threatening?
- Hang on.

726
00:43:11,389 --> 00:43:14,899
I just came in here,
apologized and increased
the offer by $25,000.

727
00:43:14,970 --> 00:43:18,611
- I'm sorry.
- And that offer should
be put to Mr. Kerrigan...

728
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:21,360
with your strongest
possible recommendation.

729
00:43:24,498 --> 00:43:26,830
Tell 'em to get stuffed.

730
00:43:26,896 --> 00:43:30,754
- It's $25,000, Darryl.
- Don't you get this, Dennis?

731
00:43:30,828 --> 00:43:33,509
Darryl, they're
offering 25 grand extra.

732
00:43:33,577 --> 00:43:37,469
Dennis, this is not about money.
I am not leaving my house.

733
00:43:37,541 --> 00:43:39,776
- Tell 'em I'm not moving.
- They're not gonna be happy.

734
00:43:39,844 --> 00:43:43,637
- Who cares?
- I mean, they're
gonna be really unhappy.

735
00:43:45,150 --> 00:43:48,311
- So what are you telling me, Dennis?
- Nothing, Darryl.

736
00:43:48,379 --> 00:43:50,647
- Did they threaten you?
- Not me, really.

737
00:43:50,714 --> 00:43:53,013
- They threatened me.
- Not exactly. They just said--

738
00:43:53,079 --> 00:43:55,695
- They fucking well threatened me.
- They just said--

739
00:43:55,765 --> 00:44:00,779
I want you to get on that phone
right now and tell 'em where
they can shove their 25 grand.

740
00:44:00,848 --> 00:44:03,366
Darryl, " them"
is the Barlow Group,

741
00:44:03,438 --> 00:44:05,346
people used
to getting their way.

742
00:44:05,421 --> 00:44:07,720
Now, they want
to expand the airport,

743
00:44:07,786 --> 00:44:10,054
and there's one bloke
who's a pain in the ass.

744
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:13,532
Tell 'em to get stuffed.

745
00:44:23,452 --> 00:44:25,360
More, darling?

746
00:44:25,433 --> 00:44:29,260
Oh, no. No, love. That was beautiful.
What do you call that?

747
00:44:29,334 --> 00:44:31,437
lce cream.

748
00:44:31,508 --> 00:44:35,596
Yeah, but what you've done with it.
What did you do to it?

749
00:44:35,665 --> 00:44:38,629
Scooped it out of the tub.

750
00:44:38,702 --> 00:44:40,871
Did I do the right thing?

751
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:43,719
Oh, yes, sweetheart,
you did the right thing.

752
00:44:43,785 --> 00:44:46,914
- Twenty-five grand, Dad.
- Yeah, but not that way, Steve.

753
00:44:46,983 --> 00:44:49,152
We're not gonna
take the money.

754
00:44:52,417 --> 00:44:55,066
- I want to tell you a story.
- Oh, good.

755
00:44:55,135 --> 00:44:57,434
- About how your father and I met.
- I know this one.

756
00:44:57,501 --> 00:44:59,354
Not all of it, Dale.

757
00:44:59,419 --> 00:45:04,336
You see, I used to go out
with a very handsome young man,

758
00:45:04,406 --> 00:45:06,477
well-to-do,
called Bob Thompson.

759
00:45:06,549 --> 00:45:09,960
Big Bob Thompson.
What's he doing now, eh?

760
00:45:10,033 --> 00:45:12,006
Putting in fence posts
in the country.

761
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:14,466
- He runs a construction company.
- So he says.

762
00:45:14,542 --> 00:45:17,354
Well, anyway, one night he took me
to the greyhounds.

763
00:45:17,419 --> 00:45:21,245
- He put on a real show.
We ate at the carvery.
- What did you have?

764
00:45:21,319 --> 00:45:23,226
Uh, pork.

765
00:45:23,301 --> 00:45:25,851
Anyway, we had wine, champagne.

766
00:45:25,923 --> 00:45:29,083
He put on all my bets,
and he was just sweeping me off my feet.

767
00:45:29,152 --> 00:45:32,498
And I wouldn't have
been at all surprised
if he'd popped the question.

768
00:45:32,572 --> 00:45:35,569
Well, anyway, later on--
I don't know what it was--

769
00:45:35,643 --> 00:45:39,414
But out of the corner of my eye
I spotted this lanky bloke...

770
00:45:39,479 --> 00:45:41,714
- struggling with one of his greyhounds.
- Red Rocket.

771
00:45:41,781 --> 00:45:45,868
- That's you, Dad.
- Now, Bob, he went off to talk
to one of the stewards.

772
00:45:45,937 --> 00:45:49,479
And this young fella,
he comes right up to me
and starts chatting to me...

773
00:45:49,549 --> 00:45:51,555
and he asks me out.

774
00:45:51,627 --> 00:45:55,236
And I said,
"Well, I'm on a date."

775
00:45:55,304 --> 00:45:58,335
Well, he backed right off.

776
00:45:58,406 --> 00:46:03,006
He said he wasn't cutting
anyone's lunch,
and he wished me good night.

777
00:46:03,073 --> 00:46:07,193
And I thought,
"That man has principles."

778
00:46:07,261 --> 00:46:11,927
And from that day on,
I've only had eyes for one man.

779
00:46:11,994 --> 00:46:14,447
Hook, line and sinker.

780
00:46:14,519 --> 00:46:18,193
And that's what I love about him:
his principles.

781
00:46:18,259 --> 00:46:20,908
So we're not taking
the money, Steve.

782
00:46:20,977 --> 00:46:24,454
Hang on. I'll get it.

783
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:29,380
What was the carvery like?

784
00:46:31,399 --> 00:46:33,764
- Yeah?
- Mr. Kerrigan.

785
00:46:33,829 --> 00:46:36,445
- Yeah? What?
- I've just got a message to pass on.

786
00:46:36,515 --> 00:46:39,098
- From who?
- I'm just passing on a message.

787
00:46:39,168 --> 00:46:41,849
- Are you from the council?
- No, I'm not from the council.

788
00:46:41,918 --> 00:46:44,730
- The company.
- I'm just passing on
a message, Mr. Kerrigan.

789
00:46:44,795 --> 00:46:46,965
They always send
someone different, don't they?

790
00:46:47,032 --> 00:46:50,607
The message is,
"Take the offer and shut up."
Understood?

791
00:46:50,677 --> 00:46:52,912
- Are you threatening me?
- I'm just passing on a message.

792
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:55,366
- Fuck off, you clown! Fuck off!
- Mr. Kerrigan--

793
00:46:55,442 --> 00:46:57,741
- You better watch your mouth, pal.
- You heard my dad.

794
00:46:57,807 --> 00:47:00,871
- Now, fuck off!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa. Fine.

795
00:47:00,941 --> 00:47:03,687
I'm just trying
to tell you.

796
00:47:07,174 --> 00:47:09,856
And what the fuck do you think
you're doing?

797
00:47:09,924 --> 00:47:12,311
You know what I said after Wayne.
No more guns in the house.

798
00:47:12,386 --> 00:47:14,555
- Yeah, but he was threatening you.
- Where did you get it?

799
00:47:14,624 --> 00:47:16,858
- Trading Post.
- And what did you pay for it?

800
00:47:16,925 --> 00:47:19,770
- One-eighty.
- What was he asking?

801
00:47:19,835 --> 00:47:23,248
- Two-fifty.
- He was dreaming.

802
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:26,733
- Yeah.
- Get rid of it.

803
00:47:28,755 --> 00:47:30,608
Sell it.

804
00:47:48,897 --> 00:47:51,229
Pricks!

805
00:47:54,331 --> 00:47:57,711
All right. All right.

806
00:47:57,785 --> 00:48:00,652
I might pass on
a message of my own.

807
00:48:13,354 --> 00:48:17,725
Don't bullshit me, pal.
I know why you want Highview Crescent.

808
00:48:17,798 --> 00:48:20,795
It's because you're
too much of a tight-ass
to fill in the quarry.

809
00:48:20,868 --> 00:48:24,378
It's easier to knock down
people's houses than it
is to fill in a hole.

810
00:48:24,449 --> 00:48:26,356
Well, what do
you say to that?

811
00:48:26,431 --> 00:48:28,316
Get off my property
or I'll call the police.

812
00:48:28,381 --> 00:48:31,607
Fuck the police! You're the asshole
who had my car smashed!

813
00:48:31,674 --> 00:48:34,257
Settle down, mate.
Settle down.

814
00:48:34,328 --> 00:48:36,911
It's just what
he wants us to do.

815
00:48:38,611 --> 00:48:43,179
Let's just keep our cool.
We don't wanna do anything stupid.

816
00:49:10,838 --> 00:49:14,032
- Darryl John Kerrigan?
- You know who I am, Mick.

817
00:49:14,099 --> 00:49:16,714
- Darryl John Kerrigan.
- Yes, officer?

818
00:49:16,785 --> 00:49:20,164
Were you on Lansell Road,
Toorak at approximately
2:30 this morning?

819
00:49:20,237 --> 00:49:23,878
- No.
- Is there anyone who can verify
your whereabouts at that hour?

820
00:49:23,947 --> 00:49:28,197
Yeah, yeah. Everyone in this house.
While we've still got it.

821
00:49:28,263 --> 00:49:32,088
- Daz, I know you did it.
- I told you, mate.
I don't know anything--

822
00:49:32,162 --> 00:49:35,356
- Shut up. I'm not going to book you.
This is just a warning.

823
00:49:35,423 --> 00:49:39,195
I know what's going on.
No one wants to see you get
the rough end of the stick,

824
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:41,430
but you're gonna have
to watch yourself.

825
00:49:41,497 --> 00:49:43,983
- Otherwise, you'll end up losing more
than this house.
- Mick.

826
00:49:44,056 --> 00:49:48,013
Darryl, I've seen it happen, mate.
Now, settle down.

827
00:49:48,085 --> 00:49:52,237
If you wanna take 'em on,
do it the right way. By the book.

828
00:49:52,304 --> 00:49:55,562
- All right, Mick.
- Oh, and, uh, Daz?

829
00:49:55,629 --> 00:49:59,138
- Yeah?
- Put them gates around the back.

830
00:49:59,210 --> 00:50:01,063
Oh.

831
00:50:08,066 --> 00:50:10,584
Now, listen.
Things are gettin' a bit serious.

832
00:50:10,655 --> 00:50:14,744
Last night I had a visit
from some hired thug.

833
00:50:14,811 --> 00:50:17,743
- Yeah, me too.
-What do you mean, you too?

834
00:50:17,817 --> 00:50:21,742
A man, he come to my house and he say,
"Stop with the court business."

835
00:50:21,813 --> 00:50:24,365
If no stop, he have friend
who come and beat me.

836
00:50:24,435 --> 00:50:26,855
And I say,
"You have friend, I have friend.

837
00:50:26,929 --> 00:50:30,155
My friend come to your house,
put bomb under your car
and blow you to fucking sky."

838
00:50:30,222 --> 00:50:33,121
- What'd he do?
- He get scared and he leave.

839
00:50:33,195 --> 00:50:36,356
- I bet he did.
- I-I don't really
have friend like this,

840
00:50:36,424 --> 00:50:39,836
but, you know, I'm Arab and people think
all Arab have bomb.

841
00:50:39,909 --> 00:50:43,702
You're a bloody ripper, Farouk.
That's fuckin' fantastic.

842
00:50:43,778 --> 00:50:46,873
- Excuse the French, Evonne.
- Get your hand off it, Darryl.

843
00:50:46,942 --> 00:50:50,256
Anyway, um,
I was worried for everyone.

844
00:50:50,332 --> 00:50:54,103
I just didn't want to force
anyone into this. Farouk?

845
00:50:54,168 --> 00:50:56,435
No, I'm with you,
Mr. Darryl.

846
00:50:56,502 --> 00:50:59,467
- Evonne?
- What are they gonna do
my ex hasn't done?

847
00:50:59,538 --> 00:51:02,667
- Jack?
- Yeah, fuck 'em.

848
00:51:02,736 --> 00:51:05,800
Well, Dennis Denuto
is acting on our behalf.

849
00:51:05,869 --> 00:51:08,550
We've gotta be
in federal court next Tuesday.

850
00:51:08,619 --> 00:51:10,307
Does he think
we've got a good case?

851
00:51:10,378 --> 00:51:13,506
Well, he reckons it just has
to contravene the Constitution.

852
00:51:13,573 --> 00:51:16,353
And the Constitution
is the biggest law we've got.

853
00:51:18,033 --> 00:51:19,055
How much?

854
00:51:19,234 --> 00:51:21,621
Ah, good point, Evonne. Steve?

855
00:51:23,838 --> 00:51:27,511
Now, all up,
it's gonna cost 1,500.

856
00:51:27,578 --> 00:51:30,924
Now, that's 750 now,
750 in six months' time.

857
00:51:30,999 --> 00:51:33,201
So 150 each.

858
00:51:33,269 --> 00:51:36,333
And, Jack, I know you can't do it,
so I'm kickin' in for you.

859
00:51:36,402 --> 00:51:38,888
Oh, good on you, Darryl.
I'll pay you back.

860
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:41,346
- Evonne?
- Yeah, fine.

861
00:51:41,422 --> 00:51:43,492
- Farouk?
- I pay cash now.

862
00:51:43,564 --> 00:51:48,480
No, no, no, hold your horses.
What is it with wogs and cash?

863
00:51:48,550 --> 00:51:51,363
Anyway, it's
bargain-basement prices,

864
00:51:51,428 --> 00:51:55,832
and, uh, you'd better
wear a suit this time, Farouk.

865
00:51:55,905 --> 00:51:58,074
What's this Dennis Denuto
like, Darryl?

866
00:51:58,142 --> 00:52:02,164
Ah, he's a lawyer.
This is about the law.

867
00:52:02,235 --> 00:52:04,785
He's gotta know
what he's doin'.

868
00:52:08,085 --> 00:52:10,701
Um... all--
all right.

869
00:52:10,770 --> 00:52:12,972
Gi-Give me
one moment...

870
00:52:13,041 --> 00:52:14,894
and I--
and I will.

871
00:52:14,959 --> 00:52:17,445
Um... it's the--

872
00:52:19,434 --> 00:52:21,343
the, um-- the--

873
00:52:23,144 --> 00:52:25,759
the Constitution
of Australia.

874
00:52:25,829 --> 00:52:29,404
This is a blatant violation...

875
00:52:29,474 --> 00:52:32,820
of the Constitution
of the Commonwealth of Australia.

876
00:52:32,895 --> 00:52:35,707
And when it comes
to violations,

877
00:52:35,772 --> 00:52:37,876
they don't come
any bigger.

878
00:52:39,289 --> 00:52:42,515
What section of the Constitution
has been breached?

879
00:52:42,582 --> 00:52:44,435
Section?

880
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:47,083
Wh-What section?

881
00:52:47,153 --> 00:52:49,606
There is no one section.

882
00:52:49,679 --> 00:52:53,221
It's just the vibe of the thing.

883
00:52:54,795 --> 00:52:58,533
I'm afraid, Mr. Denuto,
you'll have to be more specific.

884
00:52:58,599 --> 00:53:00,452
Oh, yeah,
sure, sure.

885
00:53:00,518 --> 00:53:03,613
I was just starting general,
and then I was getting...
more specific...

886
00:53:03,682 --> 00:53:07,541
with the-- the, um--
Just one moment, please.

887
00:53:07,615 --> 00:53:09,784
The, um--

888
00:53:09,854 --> 00:53:13,112
Jesus, Darryl,
I am sweatin' here.

889
00:53:13,178 --> 00:53:15,217
You're killin' them,
Dennis.

890
00:53:15,288 --> 00:53:17,674
I don't even know
Roman numerals.

891
00:53:17,750 --> 00:53:20,878
Um-- It's-- It's--

892
00:53:20,946 --> 00:53:22,800
Ju--
I've got it here.

893
00:53:22,865 --> 00:53:26,691
It's the... section 51,

894
00:53:26,766 --> 00:53:30,058
uh, second
from the bottom.

895
00:53:31,369 --> 00:53:33,887
"The Parliament shall
have power to make laws...

896
00:53:33,959 --> 00:53:37,054
with respect to copyrights,
patents of inventions...

897
00:53:37,123 --> 00:53:39,293
and designs
and trademarks."

898
00:53:39,362 --> 00:53:41,880
It's all part of it.

899
00:53:41,952 --> 00:53:44,251
This is what I'm getting at.
That's my point.

900
00:53:44,317 --> 00:53:46,486
It's-- It's
the vibe of it.

901
00:53:46,556 --> 00:53:49,521
All right. Taken.

902
00:53:49,592 --> 00:53:52,078
Do you have a precedent
which supports...

903
00:53:52,150 --> 00:53:54,352
this...vibe?

904
00:53:54,421 --> 00:53:57,451
Uh... yes.

905
00:53:57,521 --> 00:54:00,552
Yes, I do.
Um, just one moment.

906
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:05,125
What's the name
of the famous aboriginal?

907
00:54:05,195 --> 00:54:07,364
- Cathy Freeman.
- No, the court case.

908
00:54:07,433 --> 00:54:09,983
- Evonne Goolagong.
- No, no, no. Ma-- Mabo.

909
00:54:10,054 --> 00:54:11,961
Mabo.

910
00:54:12,037 --> 00:54:14,522
What about it?

911
00:54:14,594 --> 00:54:18,136
That's your classic case
of big business...

912
00:54:18,207 --> 00:54:20,093
trying to take land,

913
00:54:20,157 --> 00:54:22,010
and they couldn't.

914
00:54:22,075 --> 00:54:24,942
Mr. Denuto,
the Mabo decision...

915
00:54:25,017 --> 00:54:29,388
pertains to the specific
issue of native land title
and terra nullius.

916
00:54:29,461 --> 00:54:31,346
Yeah.

917
00:54:31,410 --> 00:54:35,433
So what part of the judgment
is relevant to this case?

918
00:54:35,503 --> 00:54:39,972
A-Again, i-it's just
the vibe of it.

919
00:54:42,057 --> 00:54:45,021
Actually, may I
approach the bench?

920
00:54:52,607 --> 00:54:55,092
Am I wasting
my time here?

921
00:54:55,165 --> 00:54:57,400
Your case
is not strong.

922
00:54:57,467 --> 00:55:01,173
- Am I sort of in the ballpark though?
- I'm a judge.

923
00:55:01,239 --> 00:55:03,888
I understand.
Can you just give me an angle?

924
00:55:03,957 --> 00:55:06,288
I'm sorry, Mr. Denuto.
I can't.

925
00:55:06,355 --> 00:55:08,425
Understood.
Understood.

926
00:55:08,497 --> 00:55:11,080
I think I've got
a good one anyway.

927
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:21,467
In summing up,
i-it's the Constitution,

928
00:55:21,541 --> 00:55:24,985
it's Mabo,
it's justice, it's law.

929
00:55:25,058 --> 00:55:28,731
It's the vibe,
and, uh--

930
00:55:28,798 --> 00:55:31,218
No, that's it.
It's the vibe.

931
00:55:33,210 --> 00:55:35,249
I rest my case.

932
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:38,187
That was sensational.

933
00:55:38,262 --> 00:55:40,497
Counsel for the respondent?

934
00:55:41,874 --> 00:55:44,327
Your Honor, I don't wish to waste
any more of your time.

935
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:47,693
- Appreciated.
- All our arguments are contained
in the forward documents,

936
00:55:47,758 --> 00:55:51,333
and we'd be more than happy
for that to constitute
the case for the respondent.

937
00:55:51,401 --> 00:55:53,538
Thank you. So be it.

938
00:55:53,608 --> 00:55:55,940
I call a one-hour
adjournment.

939
00:55:56,006 --> 00:55:58,873
Good on ya, Dennis.
That shut 'em up.

940
00:55:58,947 --> 00:56:01,846
I'm going for a bit
of a breather, mate.

941
00:56:41,883 --> 00:56:43,736
How you goin'?

942
00:56:43,802 --> 00:56:45,839
Oh, fine. Fine.

943
00:56:45,912 --> 00:56:48,299
- Got a case comin' up?
- Uh, no, no.

944
00:56:48,374 --> 00:56:51,186
I'm here to see someone.
I'm-I'm a spectator today.

945
00:56:51,251 --> 00:56:54,958
- Are you?
- My son's first appearance.

946
00:56:55,024 --> 00:56:58,534
Oh? Do you reckon
he'll get off?

947
00:56:58,605 --> 00:57:01,023
Oh, no, no.
He's a barrister.

948
00:57:01,099 --> 00:57:04,608
- He's appearing for
the first time as a barrister.
- Congratulations.

949
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:07,098
- Thank you.
- Uh, Darryl Kerrigan.

950
00:57:07,173 --> 00:57:09,952
- Lawrence Hammill.
- G'day, Lawrence.

951
00:57:10,019 --> 00:57:13,179
Barrister, eh?
He'd need a degree for that.

952
00:57:13,247 --> 00:57:16,561
Yes, yes. He-He's got a couple,
actually.

953
00:57:16,636 --> 00:57:20,593
- Ah, you must be as proud as punch.
- Well, you know.

954
00:57:20,664 --> 00:57:23,029
Oh, I know.
I've got a daughter.

955
00:57:23,094 --> 00:57:26,735
Diploma certificate,
fully qualified hairdresser.

956
00:57:26,803 --> 00:57:30,956
The day she came home
and told me she'd got
into Sunshine Tech...

957
00:57:31,023 --> 00:57:34,315
- was the proudest day of my life.
- Yes, yes, I can imagine.

958
00:57:34,380 --> 00:57:38,239
Yeah, sure makes us parents
look like a bunch of dodos, eh?

959
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:42,655
You wouldn't have dreamt
of doing what your son's done.

960
00:57:42,724 --> 00:57:46,332
No, no. Anyway, Darryl,
what brings you here?

961
00:57:46,401 --> 00:57:48,820
Our bloody government's
trying to take my house.

962
00:57:48,895 --> 00:57:51,381
This new Air Link thing.
I mean, imagine that.

963
00:57:51,452 --> 00:57:53,938
Sal and me, we brought up
our whole family in that house,

964
00:57:54,011 --> 00:57:56,561
and they think they
can just walk in--

965
00:57:58,006 --> 00:58:00,786
Anyway, we're takin' 'em
to court.

966
00:58:00,852 --> 00:58:04,493
Bloody outrageous.
It's gotta be against the Constitution.

967
00:58:04,561 --> 00:58:07,460
Yes, it is outrageous.
Who's acting for you?

968
00:58:07,534 --> 00:58:11,076
- Dennis Denuto.
- Uh, never heard of him.

969
00:58:11,147 --> 00:58:13,926
You wouldn't have.
He just does our local area.

970
00:58:13,992 --> 00:58:17,120
Yeah, but I've never heard of him
in Constitutional law.

971
00:58:17,188 --> 00:58:20,001
Oh, no, you wouldn't.
No, he does conveyancing mainly.

972
00:58:20,066 --> 00:58:22,485
You know, wills, petty theft,
that sort of thing.

973
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:24,947
But hey, it's all based
on the Constitution.

974
00:58:25,021 --> 00:58:28,367
Yes. Yes, in a way.

975
00:58:28,444 --> 00:58:32,052
- Good bloke though.
- Yes. Sounds like it.

976
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:34,866
Anyway, uh,
I'd better be going.

977
00:58:34,933 --> 00:58:38,279
- Sure.
- Nice talking to you, Lawrie.

978
00:58:38,353 --> 00:58:40,904
- Nice talking to you, Darryl.
- And good luck with your boy.

979
00:58:40,975 --> 00:58:45,281
Thanks, Darryl.
I hope everything works out.

980
00:58:45,356 --> 00:58:48,201
Ah, yeah, yeah.
I'm pretty confident.

981
00:58:48,265 --> 00:58:50,532
I find in favor
of the respondent.

982
00:58:50,599 --> 00:58:52,507
Yes!

983
00:58:54,692 --> 00:58:56,861
It's them, Darryl.

984
00:58:56,929 --> 00:59:00,090
But we was respondin'
to them.

985
00:59:00,158 --> 00:59:04,049
We lost, Darryl.
I'm sorry.

986
00:59:04,123 --> 00:59:07,251
<i>Dad reckons he must have
sat there for an hour.</i>

987
00:59:07,319 --> 00:59:10,796
<i>He said it was like being kicked
in the guts with the back end of a bus.</i>

988
00:59:10,868 --> 00:59:14,826
<i>Dad had to explain to Farouk
that they had lost.</i>

989
00:59:14,929 --> 00:59:17,959
<i>It was really hard
telling Evonne too.</i>

990
00:59:18,030 --> 00:59:20,841
<i>But the toughest one
was Jack.</i>

991
00:59:26,118 --> 00:59:27,971
<i>Trace and Con
were great though.</i>

992
00:59:29,858 --> 00:59:33,783
Good on you, Dad. You stood up to them.
I'm so proud of you.

993
00:59:33,856 --> 00:59:37,300
I'm so impressed with your fighting
quality, Mr. Kerrigan.

994
00:59:37,372 --> 00:59:39,224
Thanks, mate.

995
00:59:39,290 --> 00:59:42,931
And can I just say how disenchanted
I am with our legal system.

996
00:59:48,274 --> 00:59:51,468
<i>Dad was very quiet
after losing the court case.</i>

997
00:59:51,536 --> 00:59:54,054
<i>I'd never seen him so down.</i>

998
00:59:54,125 --> 00:59:57,438
<i>He even stopped complimenting Mum
on her cooking.</i>

999
00:59:59,752 --> 01:00:01,757
You all right there,
Darryl?

1000
01:00:01,830 --> 01:00:03,683
Yeah.

1001
01:00:07,999 --> 01:00:10,364
Dad?

1002
01:00:10,429 --> 01:00:13,177
Someone's, uh,

1003
01:00:13,243 --> 01:00:15,891
sellin' a telephone box.

1004
01:00:22,706 --> 01:00:25,421
They said no
to an extension.

1005
01:00:26,607 --> 01:00:29,027
Dennis says we've got
to be out in two weeks.

1006
01:00:29,100 --> 01:00:30,953
Two weeks?

1007
01:00:37,957 --> 01:00:40,410
I haven't told Wayne yet.

1008
01:00:42,049 --> 01:00:44,730
<i>I think Dad felt he'd let
everyone down, but especially Wayne.</i>

1009
01:00:44,798 --> 01:00:47,611
<i>That's why he'd been
puttin' off tellin' him.</i>

1010
01:00:47,676 --> 01:00:50,521
<i>He just couldn't think of a way
to break it to Wayne.</i>

1011
01:00:50,586 --> 01:00:53,582
<i>I told Dad not to worry.
I knew how to tell Wayne we'd lost.</i>

1012
01:00:53,654 --> 01:00:57,164
- We lost.
- Lost?

1013
01:00:57,235 --> 01:00:59,884
Yeah.

1014
01:00:59,953 --> 01:01:01,806
Did Dad do his nut?

1015
01:01:01,870 --> 01:01:04,967
Nah, he's gone all quiet.

1016
01:01:06,123 --> 01:01:08,609
Quiet?

1017
01:01:08,680 --> 01:01:11,874
Yeah. I think he thinks
he's let everyone down.

1018
01:01:11,942 --> 01:01:13,795
Letus down?

1019
01:01:13,861 --> 01:01:16,509
Yeah, that's what I think.

1020
01:01:16,577 --> 01:01:18,430
See, especially you.

1021
01:01:18,496 --> 01:01:21,689
I think he was lookin' forward
to the day you came back to the house.

1022
01:01:21,757 --> 01:01:24,089
Well, you tell Dad...

1023
01:01:24,155 --> 01:01:27,763
the only reason
I loved that house is 'cause
it had him and Mum in it...

1024
01:01:27,831 --> 01:01:30,611
and like... everyone else.

1025
01:01:30,677 --> 01:01:33,228
Wherever they go,
I'll love...

1026
01:01:33,299 --> 01:01:36,591
as long as it
has them in it.

1027
01:01:36,655 --> 01:01:40,842
And all those lawyers
and government people
can just go and get fucked.

1028
01:01:40,908 --> 01:01:42,761
"...as long as it
has them in it.

1029
01:01:42,826 --> 01:01:46,052
And all those lawyers
and government people
can go and get fucked."

1030
01:01:46,119 --> 01:01:50,174
Ah, he wanted me to change
that " get fucked" bit, but I forgot.

1031
01:01:50,243 --> 01:01:52,891
On you, mate.

1032
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:55,445
I'd better keep packin'.

1033
01:02:32,444 --> 01:02:35,889
Dad?

1034
01:02:35,961 --> 01:02:38,381
Steven.

1035
01:02:38,455 --> 01:02:43,121
I can, uh, get you
some more boxes, if you want.

1036
01:02:43,186 --> 01:02:45,901
No, I think I'll be all right,
Steve.

1037
01:02:50,443 --> 01:02:52,296
Dad?

1038
01:02:54,472 --> 01:02:56,642
You haven't let anyone down.

1039
01:02:58,117 --> 01:03:01,726
I don't know what the opposite of...
lettin' someone down is,

1040
01:03:03,553 --> 01:03:05,884
but you done
the opposite.

1041
01:03:18,707 --> 01:03:21,071
When are you
gonna sign 'em?

1042
01:03:23,214 --> 01:03:26,310
- I don't know.
- They gotta be done by Friday.

1043
01:03:26,380 --> 01:03:28,995
I can't.

1044
01:03:29,065 --> 01:03:31,070
lcan't.
I just can't.

1045
01:03:31,142 --> 01:03:33,508
Darryl, we gotta go.

1046
01:03:33,573 --> 01:03:35,546
Yeah, I know.
I know we lost.

1047
01:03:35,619 --> 01:03:37,950
I know we gotta get out
of this place.

1048
01:03:38,017 --> 01:03:41,788
I know this is no longer
our house, but I'll be buggered
if I can sign those papers.

1049
01:03:41,853 --> 01:03:45,625
I just cannot physically
pick up the pen and sign them.

1050
01:03:50,421 --> 01:03:52,427
Did you speak
to Jack?

1051
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:57,034
Yeah, yeah. His son-in-law's moved
to Perth, so he's no help.

1052
01:03:57,104 --> 01:04:00,362
Poor Jack.

1053
01:04:00,428 --> 01:04:04,320
Listen, I-I told him
he could stay with us
until we work somethin' out.

1054
01:04:05,927 --> 01:04:08,064
How'd you go
with the agent?

1055
01:04:08,133 --> 01:04:11,196
Two-bedroom units
are $80,000.

1056
01:04:11,266 --> 01:04:13,119
A flat.

1057
01:04:13,184 --> 01:04:16,564
With four people,
the greyhounds,

1058
01:04:16,638 --> 01:04:18,872
five cars,

1059
01:04:18,939 --> 01:04:20,847
the boat and Jack.

1060
01:04:20,922 --> 01:04:22,927
It'll be okay.

1061
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:26,825
- And what are we gonna do with Wayne?
- Wayne'll understand.

1062
01:04:26,900 --> 01:04:30,160
You know he keeps a photo
of this place on his wall.

1063
01:04:30,226 --> 01:04:32,079
I know.

1064
01:04:32,144 --> 01:04:37,190
He gets out after five years,
we have to put him in a laundry
smaller than his cell.

1065
01:04:37,258 --> 01:04:40,605
- Maybe we rent.
- Rent?

1066
01:04:40,680 --> 01:04:43,906
We not only lose our place,
we're payin' for someone else's.

1067
01:04:43,972 --> 01:04:47,897
- Oh, Darryl--
- I'm starting to understand
how the aborigines feel.

1068
01:04:50,364 --> 01:04:52,852
Have you been drinkin'?

1069
01:04:52,924 --> 01:04:55,707
Well, this house
is like their land.

1070
01:04:55,773 --> 01:04:57,879
It-It holds
their memories.

1071
01:04:57,950 --> 01:05:00,284
The land is their story.
It's everything.

1072
01:05:00,350 --> 01:05:04,126
You just can't pick it up
and plonk it down somewhere else.

1073
01:05:05,534 --> 01:05:08,830
This country's gotta stop
stealin' other people's land.

1074
01:05:08,895 --> 01:05:12,279
Dad? There's someone
here to see you.

1075
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:16,096
G'day, Darryl.

1076
01:05:17,217 --> 01:05:19,073
Lawrie.

1077
01:05:20,163 --> 01:05:22,335
So I thought
I'd come and visit.

1078
01:05:22,404 --> 01:05:25,274
- But how'd you find us?
- You know us dodos.

1079
01:05:25,347 --> 01:05:28,251
- We've got a few tricks up our sleeves.
- Don't I know it.

1080
01:05:29,317 --> 01:05:32,481
I, uh, heard
about the decision.

1081
01:05:32,550 --> 01:05:35,747
Yeah. Yeah, well,
that's the way these things are.

1082
01:05:35,814 --> 01:05:38,367
- How'd your boy go?
- Oh, fine. Yeah, fine.

1083
01:05:38,438 --> 01:05:42,150
- Great.
- Darryl, I wonder if I
could put something to you.

1084
01:05:42,217 --> 01:05:44,072
Yeah, sure.

1085
01:05:44,137 --> 01:05:47,006
I don't think I
introduced myself fully.

1086
01:05:47,080 --> 01:05:50,725
You see, I'm retired now,
but I'm actually a lawyer myself.

1087
01:05:50,795 --> 01:05:54,984
Three degrees in the family.
I'd like to see your poolroom.

1088
01:05:55,050 --> 01:05:57,987
I'm, uh,
what's called a Q.C.

1089
01:05:58,060 --> 01:06:01,158
- Are you? A Q.C.? You're one of those?
- What's that?

1090
01:06:01,229 --> 01:06:04,677
- Uh, Queens Counsel.
- Oh, you counsel the queen?

1091
01:06:04,749 --> 01:06:07,881
Uh, they're the lawyers
rich people use, love.

1092
01:06:07,949 --> 01:06:11,300
Yeah, well, that's probably
the most accurate way of describing us.

1093
01:06:11,375 --> 01:06:13,285
I don't think Dennis
would be a Q.C.

1094
01:06:13,359 --> 01:06:17,102
N-No, no, I don't think.

1095
01:06:17,168 --> 01:06:19,503
Anyway, my specialty
as a Q.C...

1096
01:06:19,570 --> 01:06:22,472
was Constitutional law,
Australian Constitutional law.

1097
01:06:22,546 --> 01:06:25,067
Have you heard of
the Tasmanian Dams case?

1098
01:06:26,258 --> 01:06:28,495
- Um--
- Mabo?

1099
01:06:28,564 --> 01:06:31,794
Oh, the aboriginal guy,
told the government to shove it.

1100
01:06:31,860 --> 01:06:33,715
That's the one.

1101
01:06:33,780 --> 01:06:37,457
Uh, anyway, I've had quite
a bit to do with these over the years,

1102
01:06:37,524 --> 01:06:41,139
and I've had a look into your case
over the last few days,

1103
01:06:41,206 --> 01:06:43,694
and I think there's
a bit more to it.

1104
01:06:43,768 --> 01:06:47,063
- What do you mean?
- I think you've got a case.

1105
01:06:47,127 --> 01:06:50,194
- So Dennis was on the right track.
- Y-Yes.

1106
01:06:50,264 --> 01:06:52,239
I told you that judge
had it in for him.

1107
01:06:52,313 --> 01:06:54,583
I believe there's a section
of the Constitution...

1108
01:06:54,649 --> 01:06:57,879
about the government's right to acquire
land that hasn't been tested.

1109
01:06:57,946 --> 01:07:00,019
But Dennis tested it.

1110
01:07:00,090 --> 01:07:03,954
Well, I-I think we
could test it better.

1111
01:07:04,028 --> 01:07:08,120
Anyway, I would like
to appear on your behalf... gratis.

1112
01:07:09,277 --> 01:07:12,408
- No fee.
- Well, no, we couldn't.

1113
01:07:12,479 --> 01:07:14,899
I've done pretty well
out of this law caper over the years,

1114
01:07:14,974 --> 01:07:17,844
- so if you're happy for me
to take it further--
-Further?

1115
01:07:17,919 --> 01:07:20,919
But we've been
to the federal court.

1116
01:07:20,991 --> 01:07:23,327
How much further
can we take it?

1117
01:07:23,424 --> 01:07:25,247
<i>Three weeks later...</i>

1118
01:07:25,312 --> 01:07:29,307
<i>Dad went to the High Court
of Australia, which is the
highest court in Australia.</i>

1119
01:07:29,378 --> 01:07:32,280
<i>Lawrie asked Dennis to be
his instructing solicitor.</i>

1120
01:07:32,354 --> 01:07:35,584
<i>Dennis was stoked,
but shittin' himself at the same time.</i>

1121
01:07:35,651 --> 01:07:38,041
I'm shittin' myself.

1122
01:07:38,116 --> 01:07:41,979
- Shall we?
- Let's stick it up 'em.

1123
01:07:44,518 --> 01:07:46,852
<i>And so Dad, or as he
was called by the judge--</i>

1124
01:07:46,917 --> 01:07:49,668
<i>Darryl John Kerrigan--</i>

1125
01:07:49,734 --> 01:07:51,971
<i>sat in the High Court
of Australia and put his case.</i>

1126
01:07:52,039 --> 01:07:54,212
<i>Or at least
Mr. Hammill did.</i>

1127
01:07:54,281 --> 01:07:58,559
<i>Dennis was very helpful too.
He was passing books around
like a librarian.</i>

1128
01:07:58,633 --> 01:08:01,666
<i>He even learnt Roman numerals
especially for the trip.</i>

1129
01:08:01,737 --> 01:08:05,733
Um, paragraph, uh... 31.

1130
01:08:05,803 --> 01:08:09,001
- Thank you, Dennis.
- But Dad reckoned there
was no doubt about it.

1131
01:08:09,068 --> 01:08:12,199
<i>From the moment he stood up,
Mr. Hammill was the star of the show.</i>

1132
01:08:12,268 --> 01:08:15,815
Section 51,
paragraph 31.

1133
01:08:15,886 --> 01:08:18,734
"The parliament shall
have power to make laws...

1134
01:08:18,798 --> 01:08:23,818
with respect to the acquisition
of property on just terms."

1135
01:08:23,887 --> 01:08:26,757
Let's think about those words,
"on just terms" ...

1136
01:08:26,831 --> 01:08:29,417
and how they relate
to real people.

1137
01:08:29,489 --> 01:08:31,878
Your Honor, my client
built his home by the law,

1138
01:08:31,952 --> 01:08:34,604
in full accordance
with the law.

1139
01:08:34,673 --> 01:08:37,063
He doesn't know
about the extensions.

1140
01:08:37,139 --> 01:08:39,278
But does he have
the protection of the law?

1141
01:08:39,347 --> 01:08:43,603
How can the forcible removal
of a family, a good family,
from their home...

1142
01:08:43,668 --> 01:08:46,668
have the blessing
of our Constitution?

1143
01:08:46,740 --> 01:08:49,971
How can that be...
"just terms" ?

1144
01:08:50,037 --> 01:08:52,142
<i>Dad reckoned it
was in the bag,</i>

1145
01:08:52,213 --> 01:08:55,924
<i>even though they had five times
more lawyers than we did.</i>

1146
01:08:55,990 --> 01:08:58,806
My client has adhered
to the law, every law,

1147
01:08:58,871 --> 01:09:02,800
every statute from the Town Planning Act
to Civil Aviation Regulations.

1148
01:09:02,872 --> 01:09:06,036
But in what can only be described
as a last desperate measure,

1149
01:09:06,104 --> 01:09:10,328
my client is accused
of breaching none other
than the Constitution.

1150
01:09:10,393 --> 01:09:13,329
I mean, good Lord,
what else are we guilty of?

1151
01:09:13,403 --> 01:09:16,306
lnternational war crimes, hmm?

1152
01:09:16,380 --> 01:09:18,998
He's even paid people
to laugh for him.

1153
01:09:19,068 --> 01:09:22,364
I refer the court to His Honor
Mr. Justice Dixon's decision...

1154
01:09:22,429 --> 01:09:24,284
in Grace Brothers
and the Commonwealth.

1155
01:09:24,349 --> 01:09:27,514
<i>As much as Dad hated to admit
it the other lawyer was good,</i>

1156
01:09:27,582 --> 01:09:30,168
<i>and he was gonna give us
a real run for our money.</i>

1157
01:09:30,239 --> 01:09:32,094
A safeguard
to the commonwealth.

1158
01:09:32,160 --> 01:09:36,161
<i>But if Mr. Hammill was worried,
he didn't show it. He kept right on at 'em.</i>

1159
01:09:36,162 --> 01:09:38,550
...has acquired the status
of a constitutional guarantee,

1160
01:09:38,626 --> 01:09:40,730
which is designed
to protect the individual--

1161
01:09:40,802 --> 01:09:43,355
<i>But everything he said,
they had an answer for.</i>

1162
01:09:43,426 --> 01:09:46,841
- Your Honor, that statement
was obiter dictum.
- Was not!

1163
01:09:50,019 --> 01:09:52,322
Well, it wasn't.

1164
01:09:52,389 --> 01:09:54,560
- Was it?
- I don't know.

1165
01:09:54,628 --> 01:09:58,720
The interpretation of
"on just terms" was considered
in the Tasmanian Dams case.

1166
01:09:58,790 --> 01:10:02,817
The court took into account
the interests of the community,

1167
01:10:02,887 --> 01:10:05,822
such as, uh,
job creation--

1168
01:10:05,895 --> 01:10:08,416
<i>Dad reckoned Dennis got
the hang of things real quick.</i>

1169
01:10:08,488 --> 01:10:12,711
<i>The main job of the senior counsel
was to provide backup for the Q.C.</i>

1170
01:10:12,776 --> 01:10:16,355
Ah, yes. And this is further underlined
in Georgiades--

1171
01:10:16,426 --> 01:10:19,656
- And that's what Dennis did.
- Ah, utilitarianism.

1172
01:10:19,723 --> 01:10:22,473
The greatest good
for the greatest number.

1173
01:10:22,540 --> 01:10:25,410
But what this principle
fails to--

1174
01:10:31,790 --> 01:10:34,572
What this principle fails to take
into account...

1175
01:10:34,638 --> 01:10:38,502
is that competing rights cannot
be weighed one against the other.

1176
01:10:38,576 --> 01:10:42,025
Is a family's right to live freely
in their home outweighed--

1177
01:10:42,096 --> 01:10:44,333
<i>It wasn't just
legal argument.</i>

1178
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:47,020
<i>Mr. Hammill even put jokes in,
clever jokes.</i>

1179
01:10:47,090 --> 01:10:50,505
...not that our children
will have a place to live,

1180
01:10:50,578 --> 01:10:54,539
but whether they'll have prompt delivery
of their parcels.

1181
01:10:54,611 --> 01:10:57,262
<i>Dad thought
it was real funny,</i>

1182
01:10:57,332 --> 01:10:59,536
<i>even though he
didn't get it.</i>

1183
01:10:59,605 --> 01:11:02,605
Suffer in your jocks.

1184
01:11:02,678 --> 01:11:06,672
<i>In fact, there were
a lot of times he didn't quite
understand what was being said,</i>

1185
01:11:06,741 --> 01:11:10,486
<i>but one time he knew exactly
what was being said.</i>

1186
01:11:10,552 --> 01:11:13,781
He's even approached
the appellant with an offer
of compensation,

1187
01:11:13,848 --> 01:11:18,389
a generous offer considering
the nature of the, uh, dwelling,

1188
01:11:18,458 --> 01:11:21,425
or as it might more accurately
be called, eyesore.

1189
01:11:21,497 --> 01:11:24,084
- What are you calling an eyesore?
- Darryl.

1190
01:11:24,155 --> 01:11:26,392
It's called a home,
you dickhead!

1191
01:11:26,459 --> 01:11:28,314
- Your Honor.
- Darryl!

1192
01:11:28,379 --> 01:11:31,226
It's a bloody fine one. If there
were more homes like that, we'd--

1193
01:11:31,292 --> 01:11:34,010
Have the jails full
of people like your son?

1194
01:11:34,076 --> 01:11:36,946
- Ah, this bloody asshole!
- Sit down, Darryl.

1195
01:11:37,021 --> 01:11:39,542
Mr. Hammill, I'm calling
an adjournment.

1196
01:11:39,614 --> 01:11:44,351
And I trust that your client
will, in the meantime, compose himself.

1197
01:11:44,416 --> 01:11:49,567
Mr. Lyle, I'll thank you
not to make any further value
judgments in this court.

1198
01:11:49,633 --> 01:11:51,576
I'm sorry, Lawrie.

1199
01:11:51,649 --> 01:11:53,559
That's all right, Darryl.

1200
01:11:53,633 --> 01:11:55,575
I was thinking
the same thing,

1201
01:11:55,651 --> 01:11:58,138
though not
in those words.

1202
01:11:58,210 --> 01:12:01,113
I wish I had your words.

1203
01:12:01,188 --> 01:12:03,043
How dare they?

1204
01:12:03,108 --> 01:12:04,963
I mean, an eyesore!

1205
01:12:05,028 --> 01:12:08,258
I mean, that--
that just goes to show
that they don't get it.

1206
01:12:08,325 --> 01:12:10,660
I mean, they're judging the place
by what it looks like,

1207
01:12:10,725 --> 01:12:15,615
and if it doesn't have
a pool or a classy front
or a big garden--

1208
01:12:15,687 --> 01:12:17,694
It's got a pretty good gate.

1209
01:12:17,768 --> 01:12:21,795
And then because of that,
it's not worth saving.

1210
01:12:21,865 --> 01:12:25,444
But it's not a house.
It's a home.

1211
01:12:25,513 --> 01:12:28,002
It's got everything.

1212
01:12:28,074 --> 01:12:31,620
People who love each other,
care for each other.

1213
01:12:31,690 --> 01:12:33,633
It's got memories.

1214
01:12:33,707 --> 01:12:35,650
Great memories.

1215
01:12:35,725 --> 01:12:39,467
It's a place
for the family to turn to,

1216
01:12:39,532 --> 01:12:42,021
come back to.

1217
01:12:42,093 --> 01:12:46,666
But that doesn't seem to mean as much
as a big fuckin' driveway.

1218
01:12:46,734 --> 01:12:49,802
<i>Later it was time
for Mr. Hammill to sum up.</i>

1219
01:12:49,872 --> 01:12:53,221
<i>Dad said
he was unbelievable.</i>

1220
01:12:53,296 --> 01:12:56,230
<i>He reckoned he finished
like a champion greyhound.</i>

1221
01:12:56,304 --> 01:12:57,650
People who love each other--

1222
01:12:57,651 --> 01:13:00,284
<i>He quoted cases, he quoted laws.</i>

1223
01:13:00,543 --> 01:13:04,267
<i>But Dad nearly fell off
his chair when Mr. Hammill
finished by quoting Dad,</i>

1224
01:13:04,338 --> 01:13:06,193
<i>only better.</i>

1225
01:13:06,258 --> 01:13:09,455
And somehow that's not worth
as much as a big driveway.

1226
01:13:09,524 --> 01:13:14,413
You may think our appeal
is based on emotion rather than law.

1227
01:13:14,485 --> 01:13:16,526
Not true.

1228
01:13:16,598 --> 01:13:20,689
It's about the highest law in
this country, the Constitution,

1229
01:13:20,759 --> 01:13:24,372
and one phrase within it:
"on just terms."

1230
01:13:26,905 --> 01:13:30,221
That's what this
is all about-- being just.

1231
01:13:30,296 --> 01:13:33,713
They want to pay only
for the house.

1232
01:13:33,785 --> 01:13:37,616
But they're taking away
more than that, so much more.

1233
01:13:37,691 --> 01:13:40,823
Sure, the Kerrigans
built a house,

1234
01:13:40,892 --> 01:13:43,543
then they built a home,
and then a family.

1235
01:13:43,612 --> 01:13:47,836
You can acquire a house,

1236
01:13:47,901 --> 01:13:50,584
but you can't
acquire a home,

1237
01:13:50,654 --> 01:13:53,338
because a home is not built
of bricks and mortar...

1238
01:13:53,406 --> 01:13:56,953
but love and memories.

1239
01:13:58,209 --> 01:14:00,347
You can't pay for it,

1240
01:14:00,416 --> 01:14:03,319
and you're just shortchanging
people if you try.

1241
01:14:03,393 --> 01:14:07,671
I can't speak for those
who wrote this document,

1242
01:14:07,746 --> 01:14:11,359
but I'll bet when they put in
the phrase " on just terms,"

1243
01:14:11,426 --> 01:14:14,724
they hoped
it would stop anyone...

1244
01:14:14,788 --> 01:14:19,196
shortchanging someone
like Darryl Kerrigan.

1245
01:14:21,254 --> 01:14:23,872
Thanks, Lawrence.

1246
01:14:29,863 --> 01:14:32,963
Thank you.

1247
01:14:33,031 --> 01:14:37,115
<i>In the end, who knows whether
it was Dad's words or Mr. Hammill</i>

1248
01:14:37,116 --> 01:14:40,563
<i>or even Dennis' note passing--
...but we won the case.</i>

1249
01:14:40,731 --> 01:14:42,593
...in favor
of the appellant.

1250
01:14:42,666 --> 01:14:44,521
Shit.

1251
01:14:46,220 --> 01:14:48,075
That's us.

1252
01:14:48,140 --> 01:14:50,824
Bullshit.
We won?

1253
01:14:50,892 --> 01:14:54,275
- We won.
- You little ripper!

1254
01:14:54,349 --> 01:14:58,245
Thanks, lads.

1255
01:14:58,318 --> 01:14:59,079
We won.

1256
01:14:59,080 --> 01:15:01,682
<i>Dad was stoked
but suitably restrained.</i>

1257
01:15:01,775 --> 01:15:04,645
<i>He reckons the other side
didn't know what to do with themselves.</i>

1258
01:15:04,718 --> 01:15:07,141
<i>Dennis was so stunned,
he went all quiet.</i>

1259
01:15:07,216 --> 01:15:10,762
<i>Dad reckons he almost cried.
In fact, I think he did.</i>

1260
01:15:10,833 --> 01:15:13,354
<i>Mr. Hammill
just sat there for ages.</i>

1261
01:15:13,426 --> 01:15:17,681
<i>He reckoned it was the most satisfying
victory he'd had in 47 years.</i>

1262
01:15:17,747 --> 01:15:21,425
<i>Dad reckons it's important
to be noble in victory,
so he spoke to the other Q.C. ...</i>

1263
01:15:21,491 --> 01:15:22,518
Oh, hey.

1264
01:15:22,519 --> 01:15:24,150
<i>...the one who had a go at Wayne.</i>

1265
01:15:24,293 --> 01:15:26,609
Bad luck.

1266
01:15:26,676 --> 01:15:29,744
You dickhead!

1267
01:15:30,869 --> 01:15:34,253
<i>The case was all over
the news that night.</i>

1268
01:15:34,359 --> 01:15:38,255
Good evening. First tonight,
a landmark decision in
the High Court today...

1269
01:15:38,328 --> 01:15:41,776
has confirmed the age-old saying,
"A man's home is his castle."

1270
01:15:41,849 --> 01:15:46,127
When the huge Air Link
consortium tried to compulsorily
acquire a string of homes...

1271
01:15:46,202 --> 01:15:48,591
on Melbourne's outskirts
earlier this year,

1272
01:15:48,666 --> 01:15:50,936
they didn't expect a fight.

1273
01:15:51,003 --> 01:15:54,452
- Well, they got one.
- It was a
case of Darryl versus Goliath...

1274
01:15:54,523 --> 01:15:56,858
in the High Court
of Australia today.

1275
01:15:56,924 --> 01:15:59,959
<i>Mum reckons it's real funny
how one day you're not famous,</i>

1276
01:16:00,029 --> 01:16:02,102
<i>and then the next day
you are... famous,</i>

1277
01:16:02,173 --> 01:16:04,028
<i>and then you're not
anymore.</i>

1278
01:16:04,093 --> 01:16:08,569
<i>Dad had one of the biggest parties ever
that night back at home.</i>

1279
01:16:08,639 --> 01:16:11,061
<i>He invited everyone
from the neighborhood--</i>

1280
01:16:11,136 --> 01:16:13,110
<i>his friends,
family, in-laws.</i>

1281
01:16:13,185 --> 01:16:16,250
This case has totally regained my faith
in the legal system.

1282
01:16:16,321 --> 01:16:18,150
<i>Mr. Hammill even
brought his son along.</i>

1283
01:16:18,151 --> 01:16:19,993
Really pleased to meet you.

1284
01:16:20,098 --> 01:16:22,619
<i>Everyone was havin'
a real good time,</i>

1285
01:16:26,402 --> 01:16:28,641
<i>especially Mum and Dad.</i>

1286
01:16:28,709 --> 01:16:31,905
<i>I'd never seen them
so happy.</i>

1287
01:16:31,973 --> 01:16:34,144
<i>Dad invited everyone
up to Bonnie Doon.</i>

1288
01:16:34,213 --> 01:16:36,385
I fix for you a special Farouk
pressure system.

1289
01:16:36,453 --> 01:16:40,000
<i>Mr. Hammill said he'd love
to come. I don't think he'd
ever fished for carp.</i>

1290
01:16:40,070 --> 01:16:44,350
<i>Well, that party
went on and on and on.
Dad smiled all night.</i>

1291
01:16:44,489 --> 01:16:46,565
See, this is why we need that patio.

1292
01:16:46,631 --> 01:16:48,869
<i>The victory was reported
in all the papers.</i>

1293
01:16:48,936 --> 01:16:51,752
<i>It became known
as the Kerrigan Decision.</i>

1294
01:16:51,817 --> 01:16:53,825
Jack, don't thank me.
This is the bloke.

1295
01:16:53,898 --> 01:16:57,281
<i>Although Dad said,
as far as he was concerned,
it was Lawrie's victory.</i>

1296
01:16:57,355 --> 01:17:00,323
And don't forget
Dennis here either.

1297
01:17:00,396 --> 01:17:03,745
<i>That was the beginning
of a string of good luck
for our family.</i>

1298
01:17:03,820 --> 01:17:08,163
<i>Six months later
we got notice that Wayne would
soon be eligible for parole.</i>

1299
01:17:08,237 --> 01:17:12,100
<i>Dad rang Mr. Hammill,
who was more than happy
to come out of retirement again.</i>

1300
01:17:12,174 --> 01:17:14,892
<i>Wayne said the parole board
couldn't believe their eyes.</i>

1301
01:17:14,958 --> 01:17:18,342
<i>When Mr. Hammill walked in,
he reckons they granted him
parole out of shock.</i>

1302
01:17:20,336 --> 01:17:22,857
<i>Dennis became very well-known
after the case,</i>

1303
01:17:22,928 --> 01:17:25,297
<i>and people came from everywhere
to hire him.</i>

1304
01:17:25,362 --> 01:17:27,217
<i>He won a very big case,</i>

1305
01:17:27,282 --> 01:17:31,178
<i>a class action against people who put
lead in the landfill 15 years ago.</i>

1306
01:17:31,250 --> 01:17:34,569
<i>I think Mr. Hammill
helped him there too.
Dad is very happy for him.</i>

1307
01:17:34,644 --> 01:17:37,776
<i>He even bought himself
a new photocopier,</i>

1308
01:17:37,845 --> 01:17:40,333
<i>one that never breaks down.</i>

1309
01:17:40,405 --> 01:17:43,754
<i>And guess what. Mr. Hammill did go up
to Bonnie Doon.</i>

1310
01:17:43,829 --> 01:17:46,897
<i>At first Dad thought it was
out of politeness, but it can't be...</i>

1311
01:17:46,966 --> 01:17:49,203
<i>'cause he goes up there
all the time.</i>

1312
01:17:49,272 --> 01:17:53,266
<i>He and Dad still hit it off
as good as they did
the first day they met.</i>

1313
01:17:53,336 --> 01:17:55,442
<i>Coco never won another race,</i>

1314
01:17:55,513 --> 01:17:58,513
<i>but she had a son
which Dad called Son of Coco.</i>

1315
01:17:58,585 --> 01:18:01,455
<i>He hasn't won yet,
but Dad has high hopes.</i>

1316
01:18:01,531 --> 01:18:05,687
<i>Dad did finish the patio
in a Greek style, and the extension,</i>

1317
01:18:05,755 --> 01:18:08,275
<i>and he even put up those big iron gates
that he and Steve...</i>

1318
01:18:08,347 --> 01:18:10,934
<i>had gotten for a bargain
that night in Toorak.</i>

1319
01:18:11,004 --> 01:18:13,306
<i>Steve got back with Kerry,
his old girlfriend.</i>

1320
01:18:13,373 --> 01:18:16,985
<i>Eventually they got married
and had a little boy...
three weeks later.</i>

1321
01:18:17,055 --> 01:18:20,055
"Baby carriage,
still in box."

1322
01:18:20,126 --> 01:18:22,266
<i>Con and Trace
had a kid too.</i>

1323
01:18:22,335 --> 01:18:26,773
<i>He's already taken up kickboxing.
They are great parents.</i>

1324
01:18:27,809 --> 01:18:31,606
<i>Wayne started helping Dad
with the tow truck
and really made a go at it.</i>

1325
01:18:31,680 --> 01:18:35,227
<i>Dad's even more proud of him now
than when he was in jail.</i>

1326
01:18:35,299 --> 01:18:37,404
<i>It was Wayne's idea
to move into tray trucks.</i>

1327
01:18:37,475 --> 01:18:40,062
<i>Pretty soon they had two,
then three, then eight.</i>

1328
01:18:40,131 --> 01:18:42,947
<i>Who knows when it will stop?
Mum reckons 11.</i>

1329
01:18:43,012 --> 01:18:45,565
<i>She's as proud as punch
with all this.</i>

1330
01:18:45,636 --> 01:18:50,307
<i>And guess what. She did take up pottery.
She didn't even need lessons.</i>

1331
01:18:50,373 --> 01:18:54,848
<i>And Dad, well, he reckoned
he'd got everything
he'd ever wished for.</i>

1332
01:18:54,919 --> 01:18:58,629
<i>He often used to sit out on the patio
and just smile to himself.</i>

1333
01:18:58,695 --> 01:19:01,414
<i>And they still live
at 3 Highview Crescent,</i>

1334
01:19:01,481 --> 01:19:03,816
<i>even though it's only
them two livin' in it.</i>

1335
01:19:03,881 --> 01:19:06,337
<i>And Dad still calls it
"his castle."</i>

1336
01:19:09,611 --> 01:19:13,157
My name's Dale Kerrigan,
and that was my story.
