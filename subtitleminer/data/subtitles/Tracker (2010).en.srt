1
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,800
The passenger list, sir.

2
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,900
Oh, very good.

3
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:15,300
Who are the Edmunds boys,
Private Brooke?

4
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,000
Three brothers, sir,

5
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:20,000
all posted to South Africa
on the same day...

6
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,100
my birthday in fact, sir.

7
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,800
Is that so, Brooke?

8
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,500
I don't believe it.

9
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,900
Is that...?

10
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,800
What on earth
is he doing down here?

11
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,400
Get down to
the waterfront, Brooke.

12
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,400
Get customs to pull
this chap to one side...

13
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,200
Van Diemen,
South African Boer.

14
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,200
- Escort him here, please.
- Yes, sir.

15
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:58,000
Tell him...
tell him

16
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Major Carlysle would
very much like to see him.

17
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Yes, sir.

18
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,800
This one's short.
Get me another.

19
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,900
Yes, sir.

20
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,400
Brooke,

21
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,600
where are you off to
in such a hurry?

22
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,500
I've been asked to escort
one of them Boers.

23
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,200
The major wants
to see him.

24
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,800
Let me have a look
at that.

25
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,100
We should have hung
them all, shouldn't we,

26
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,700
instead of giving them
a king's pardon?

27
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,800
What's his name?

28
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:35,300
Bloody hell.

29
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,100
With me, Brooke.

30
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,900
Come on, girls.

31
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,300
Next, please.

32
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,200
Oi.

33
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:14,400
Uh, Mr. Van Dimon.

34
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:17,900
Diemen...
Van Diemen.

35
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,200
So, Mr. Van Dimon,
what brings you

36
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,900
all the way to our remote little
corner of the world?

37
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Well, I'm curious.

38
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Curious?

39
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,700
You'd have to be very curious
to travel thousands of miles.

40
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,300
Bloody right, I'm curious.

41
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,300
I'm very curious
to find out

42
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:37,300
why you boys crossed
two oceans

43
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,900
to help the British
burn down my farm.

44
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,900
Well...

45
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:49,500
Arjan Van Diemen.

46
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,900
And I thought
the war was finished.

47
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,900
Not for you,
you murdering bastard.

48
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,300
You're under arrest.

49
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,900
Give it over.

50
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,800
Go on.

51
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:34,600
Go on.

52
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:38,300
Give him
his rifle back.

53
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,700
Now, you bloody fool!

54
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,800
Put your weapon away.

55
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,500
Do you know
who this is?

56
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,700
That'll be all.
Thank you, Saunders.

57
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,400
Jesus.

58
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:56,200
Don't make me
write you up.

59
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,600
Get back to the docks,
Brooke.

60
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:04,000
Give some real soldiers
a hero's welcome.

61
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,000
Yes, sir.

62
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:12,100
Apologies for the undignified welcome,
Mr. Van Diemen.

63
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:18,100
Saunders there was
with me in South Africa.

64
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:20,600
He seems to have forgotten
the war's over.

65
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,300
I'm sure you understand.

66
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,400
Mm.

67
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:42,200
So you do exist.

68
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:46,600
I led a detachment
of cavalry

69
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:50,300
for nearly two years
trying to catch up with you.

70
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,700
We chased you clean
across the Transvaal

71
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,700
whilst you caused havoc.

72
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,100
And you, Major...

73
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,800
you couldn't even catch
a simple farmer.

74
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,200
What's your plan here,
Van Diemen?

75
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,700
You're a long way
from home.

76
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,200
You too.

77
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:10,900
On the contrary,
this is home for me now.

78
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,900
Home?

79
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,900
Huh.

80
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:18,800
Home these days seems to be
most of the globe to you British.

81
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:28,500
So are you planning
on buying some land here,

82
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:32,400
perhaps take up
farming again?

83
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:41,400
No, I guess we didn't
leave you with much, did we?

84
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,100
Well, for what it's worth,
Mr. Van Diemen,

85
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,300
I hope you do find
your new home here.

86
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,200
Come here.

87
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,300
What is this?

88
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,600
It's a piece of home.

89
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,600
- Home?
- Mm-hmm.

90
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:46,100
What do you mean, home?

91
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,500
It belonged
to my grandfather.

92
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,600
Sometimes he would cry
over this.

93
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,900
Looks like sand to me...

94
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,400
red sand.

95
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,400
You're very pretty.

96
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,900
There's a lot prettier
in this town.

97
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,900
Some of them officers'
wives, they...

98
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,900
No no no no, I've seen
lots of women...

99
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,900
wahine on Tahiti.

100
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,200
You could be
a princess there.

101
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,600
Take your hands off me.
I'm quite capable

102
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,700
of walking by myself.

103
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:51,600
Come on, Sergeant.
You've had a bit too much.

104
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,600
Goes with the rank,
Corporal Drake,

105
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,600
- with the rank.
- Yes, Your Highness.

106
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,600
"Goes with the rank."

107
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,600
Oh, watch yourself
there, Teddy.

108
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,600
Don't you "Teddy" me.

109
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,000
Oh, hey. Oi.

110
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,100
There's a lantern on

111
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,000
in the stables.

112
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:16,200
I'll have his guts
for garters.

113
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:25,000
Well well well,

114
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,900
what have we here?

115
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,300
If it isn't young Lucy

116
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,900
and a bloody savage.

117
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,900
What are you two
doing in here,

118
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,800
besides the obvious?

119
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:44,300
I don't think
I know you.

120
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,300
Do you know him?

121
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:48,900
Never seen him.

122
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,600
Wonder where he gets
his money from.

123
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:57,900
Weren't interested
in our horses, were you?

124
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,400
He's talking to you.

125
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,800
You think he
understands English?

126
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,400
Anyway,

127
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:10,700
you're trespassing
on army property.

128
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:16,500
I think a thrashing
might be in order,

129
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,700
gentlemen, eh?

130
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:22,100
Now come and take
your punishment

131
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,200
like a good
little savage.

132
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,200
- Hold him up.
- Get up.

133
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:35,400
Eh?

134
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:38,400
I'll teach you to mess
with our women.

135
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Get up.

136
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:09,600
- What did you say?
- Leave him alone, you bastards.

137
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,500
You should have taken
your thrashing, boy.

138
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,400
Savage!

139
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,600
Christ, you bloody...

140
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:52,600
Jesus Christ.

141
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:59,800
Jesus.
Jesus Christ.

142
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:05,200
You bloody killed him.
You bloody killed him.

143
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,100
You bloody killed him.

144
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,500
We need a doctor.

145
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,600
Get a bloody doctor!

146
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:41,400
Sir...

147
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,300
You walked
into the stables

148
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,100
and he simply
attacked you?

149
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,200
Yes, sir.

150
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,600
Unprovoked?

151
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,900
Well, we did ask him
what he was doing in there.

152
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:54,200
We thought he was
after the horses.

153
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:57,100
- That was all?
- Yes, sir.

154
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,000
Levin.

155
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,800
That was about
the way of it.

156
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,700
And this was
the way of it?

157
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,800
Yes, sir.

158
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,800
That were the way of it.

159
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:25,400
Yes, sir.

160
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,900
He was off that whaler
that came in yesterday.

161
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,600
Sergeant Leybourne.

162
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:33,000
I don't think our man
will be getting far, sir.

163
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,200
Let's make sure
he doesn't.

164
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:37,700
He's been seen
heading off up the coast.

165
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,800
I'll need
half a dozen men.

166
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:41,600
That should be enough.
And horses.

167
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,800
He's on foot, so we'll soon
catch up with him.

168
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:45,300
What about dogs?

169
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,400
No, no dogs.
This isn't a blood sport.

170
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,800
I won't have it
turned into one.

171
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:52,400
Now that local scout...

172
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,900
Mr. Bryce, sir.

173
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,700
Yes, Bryce.
I want him here,

174
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,600
fully provisioned
within the hour.

175
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,400
We'll leave at first light.
See to it.

176
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,700
Van Diemen.

177
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,100
I don't suppose
you saw anything?

178
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:25,200
You know, we could use
another good tracker.

179
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,100
The reward is
100 sovereigns...

180
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:32,600
100 sovereigns alive,
25 if dead.

181
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,100
That's a lot of money.

182
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:44,500
You see that man?

183
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,700
He butchered
British officers.

184
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,300
I don't want that scum
anywhere near me.

185
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,200
That needn't trouble you,
Sergeant Major.

186
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,900
You shan't be
accompanying us.

187
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
You and Corporal Levin are in
no fit state to be chasing anybody.

188
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,500
The pair of you
will return to barracks.

189
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,900
I trust I make
myself clear.

190
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,700
Yes, sir.

191
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,700
- Well?
- Yes, sir.

192
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:13,300
Look, when I arrived
yesterday at the harbor,

193
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,300
I didn't see
any whaler.

194
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,700
They left without him
on the afternoon tide.

195
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,700
The skipper was
angry as hell,

196
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,300
charging around, shouting at
everybody if they'd seen him.

197
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,400
I tell you, I was near
to locking him up.

198
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,500
Why so angry?

199
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,500
Well, he'd lost his
harpoonist, didn't he?

200
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,100
A good harpoon man's
worth gold these days.

201
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,100
These all his belongings?

202
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,700
Yeah, these and his
kit bag over there.

203
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:39,100
- That too?
- Yeah.

204
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,300
All right, dismount.

205
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,300
Sergeant Leybourne,
these horses need a rest,

206
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:27,300
- just a few minutes.
- Yes, sir.

207
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,900
Mr. Bryce, what is it?

208
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,100
Maori.

209
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:37,800
See? The weight's
all on the toes.

210
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:40,600
No heel print.

211
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:45,300
The weight's right.

212
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:49,300
By the spacing...
his height.

213
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,300
It's him.

214
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:56,000
If he keeps heading
up this coast,

215
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,100
he'll reach
Dunney's Point,

216
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,600
find a boat... whew,

217
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,600
away at sea
'fore you know it.

218
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,700
Very well.

219
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,800
- Private Barker!
- Sir.

220
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:09,000
Get up on those rocks, man, see if we
can't get around the headland

221
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
- before the tide comes in.
- Yes, sir.

222
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:39,400
Mr. Van Diemen,
is there a problem?

223
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,600
It's not him.

224
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,000
No disrespect
to Mr. Bryce here,

225
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:48,800
but our man was used
to wearing shoes.

226
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:51,000
This man,

227
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:54,500
whoever he was...
he never wore shoes.

228
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:59,400
With respect, Major,

229
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:03,300
I don't think our man
is just another sailor.

230
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:07,400
I think
he's coming home.

231
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:58,300
Sir, if we go
right away,

232
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,800
we should be able to get around
before the tide cuts us off.

233
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:03,300
Thank you, Barker.

234
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:07,100
All right, mount up!

235
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:13,600
Van Diemen!

236
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,400
Blast the man.
Barker, get his horse.

237
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,200
Yes, sir.

238
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:12,100
Mr. Bryce.

239
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,500
Your man left
empty-handed, didn't he?

240
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:17,400
That's right.

241
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:21,400
Your Mr. Van Diemen
was right.

242
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:27,100
Raupo bread.

243
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,100
Maori pollen bread.

244
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,500
Where would he get that?

245
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,900
Look at the size
of this fire.

246
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:38,300
Whoever this fellow was,
he was in no hurry.

247
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,000
Mr. Bryce, are you
seriously telling me

248
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:43,100
that we've been following
the wrong man all day?

249
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,800
Same build, same height,

250
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:49,500
wrong Maori.

251
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,000
I knew we should have
gotten bloody dogs.

252
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
We'll double back,
pick up the trail

253
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
where our Mr. Van Diemen
disappeared on us.

254
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,700
And you're quite certain
you can do that?

255
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:01,100
I'll have two trails to follow
instead of just one.

256
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,700
Well, we'd better get on
with it then, haven't we?

257
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:09,200
Mm, been fishing, eh?

258
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:23,300
Head, feet.

259
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,600
So you knew I was
watching you, eh?

260
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:31,700
Good.

261
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:35,900
Mm.

262
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:58,500
So you've made yourself
some shoes?

263
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:01,200
Mm, clever boy.

264
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:02,200
Horses won't be much use
to us from here on, Major.

265
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:05,600
Al right.
Thank you, Mr. Bryce.

266
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,200
- Private Barker.
- Yes, sir?

267
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,800
You'll take these horses back
to base in the morning.

268
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,000
Yes, sir.

269
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:13,800
- Crowther.
- Yes, Major?

270
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:15,600
- We'll keep yours as a packhorse.
- Sir.

271
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,300
Do not move

272
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,700
unless I tell you to.

273
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:42,100
I said do not move.

274
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:46,700
Stand still.

275
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:51,900
Stop.

276
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:53,300
Shut up.

277
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,900
Argh! Bloody hell.

278
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:04,600
That's better, eh?

279
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:07,300
How much are they
paying you for me?

280
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,200
How much?

281
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:12,700
100 sovereigns alive,
25 dead.

282
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:14,400
25?

283
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:16,100
Mm.

284
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:19,600
A lot of people
would be happy with 25.

285
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,700
Lucky I got you.

286
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,300
If I have to kill you,
I will.

287
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:31,300
Mind you, anybody
who'd be happy with 25

288
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,600
would probably be
too stupid to find me.

289
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,600
Yeah, they would.

290
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:38,400
That's 75 sovereigns'
difference alive or dead.

291
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,400
I'll tell you what:

292
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:42,400
What will you give me
if I promise

293
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:45,000
- not to choke myself to death?
- Just walk.

294
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:57,200
What are you reading?

295
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:02,800
Hey, I asked you
a question.

296
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:10,200
That "the wicked
will perish.

297
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:12,200
The enemies
of the Lord

298
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:14,500
shall be as the fat
of lambs."

299
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,300
Mm.

300
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,800
"But the righteous
showeth mercy, and giveth."

301
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,800
The 37th psalm.

302
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,900
I spent a lot of time
in a missionary school.

303
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:30,700
That's where
I learned to read.

304
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,700
You're an educated man.

305
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:37,100
Does that make
a difference?

306
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,300
Perhaps.

307
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,400
Why?

308
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:52,600
Because education
distinguishes

309
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,900
the civilized man
from the savage.

310
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:58,200
Ah, there are no savages
here then.

311
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,500
The missionaries taught
us all to read...

312
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:03,500
all of us.

313
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:06,600
My father could quote your
bible from cover to cover.

314
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:09,900
"You cannot know
your enemy," he said,

315
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,400
"until you know
his God."

316
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:17,800
And did he find
their God?

317
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:20,200
Oh yes, he met Him

318
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:22,700
at the end of a rope.

319
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,200
So what's my life
worth now?

320
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:33,200
125 sovereigns?

321
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:35,700
I am not a killer.

322
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,700
You'll have
an honest trial.

323
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:46,200
I'll get
an honest hanging.

324
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:55,000
What is that?

325
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:57,300
Let me see.

326
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,300
You can trust me.

327
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:25,300
Wife? Daughters?
Pretty.

328
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,900
Yeah.

329
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:29,900
How old are they...
your daughters?

330
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:32,300
Eight, and the twins
are six.

331
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,300
And where do they live?

332
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,800
Back in town?

333
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:40,600
They don't live.

334
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:43,600
They're buried
in South Africa somewhere.

335
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:06,200
They say when
children die, they...

336
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:08,800
they stay children
forever.

337
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:29,600
You can't start a story
and not finish.

338
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:32,100
It's not good.

339
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:43,200
It's not good
for your soul.

340
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:57,700
Stop here.

341
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:02,200
Two hours.

342
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:06,400
All right,
let's keep moving.

343
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,300
It's just mouku.

344
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,300
You can eat it.

345
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,300
You didn't know that,
did you?

346
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:24,500
Mind you, you weren't
brought up here.

347
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,500
You see this?

348
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,500
Meke-meke.

349
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,600
Just a little nibble on that
and you'll be

350
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:33,200
spewing your guts out
for days.

351
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,700
I shouldn't have
told you that, should I?

352
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:48,900
"And His blessing covered
the dry land as a river

353
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,700
and watered it
as a flood."

354
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:54,500
I could build us
a raft.

355
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:00,000
"As He hath turned
the waters into saltiness,

356
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,800
so shall the heathen
inherit His wrath."

357
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,400
Stop.

358
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:34,800
Sit. Sit.

359
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:33,400
Don't move.

360
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,500
I'm not moving.

361
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:39,000
Turn around slowly.

362
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:48,000
Drop the pistol.

363
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:50,200
Drop the pistol!

364
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:52,200
No.

365
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:54,600
What?
Drop it.

366
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:57,300
No.

367
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:00,200
I'll shoot you.

368
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:02,700
You know,
when I travel

369
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,100
I always keep
an empty chamber

370
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,400
in case of accidents.

371
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:09,400
Before you cock it,

372
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:13,100
I'll have a bullet
between your eyes.

373
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,600
You're lying.

374
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:17,000
Truth is
I'm not really sure.

375
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:19,900
I've been careless
these past two days.

376
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,900
Of course,

377
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,500
we won't know until
you pull that trigger.

378
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:26,900
I don't believe you.

379
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Fine.

380
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:30,100
And I will
pull the trigger.

381
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:32,100
Fine.

382
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:34,800
Well, if you're right, I'm dead.
If I'm right, you're dead.

383
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:38,000
But until you pull that trigger,
we won't know.

384
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:39,700
Drop the gun.

385
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,700
No.

386
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:44,100
- Drop the gun.
- You drop your gun.

387
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:47,300
- I'm not dropping my gun.
- I'm not dropping my gun.

388
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,300
Fine.

389
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,300
Let's just walk to shore.

390
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,700
And keep your hands
where I can see them.

391
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:55,300
No. No.

392
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:57,400
I will pull the trigger.

393
00:42:57,500 --> 00:43:00,400
I'll take my chances.

394
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:03,000
My legs are getting cold.

395
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,700
You should have
stayed over there where it's dry.

396
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:09,400
You are the most annoying man
I have ever met.

397
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:11,500
I should kill you
for just being annoying.

398
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:13,500
I thought
you weren't a killer.

399
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:15,600
I'm not, or I would have
shot you right away.

400
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:17,700
In which case
you'd be dead.

401
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:20,400
Well, we don't know
that yet, do we?

402
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:26,000
I'd like a smoke.

403
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:27,800
No.

404
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:46,200
Damn you.

405
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:52,700
Damn you.

406
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:05,200
Come on, come on.

407
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:16,300
They meet here
separately.

408
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,300
Hold there.

409
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,900
There's two now.

410
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,200
- Both of them? Two men, both of them?
- There's two.

411
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:25,300
- All right, which way?
- This way.

412
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:33,400
Sa-bine.

413
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:36,100
Sabine.

414
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:38,800
Is that your wife?

415
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:41,900
What language is this?

416
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:43,900
I told you

417
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:47,200
I'm from South Africa.

418
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:50,000
You're one of them Boers.

419
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:55,700
Sounds like a bushpig.

420
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:00,300
"Boer"...

421
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:02,000
it means "farmer."

422
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:05,600
You're the strangest
farmer I've ever met.

423
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:13,800
You fought the British,
didn't you?

424
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:20,600
My grandfather led our people
against the British.

425
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:25,800
He was a great leader,
a warrior.

426
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:27,800
But he lost.

427
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:30,200
He lost like you.

428
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:33,900
And this brought great
shame on our people.

429
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:37,400
And we were labeled
Tangata Hara...

430
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:40,000
men of sin, rebels.

431
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,500
I never lost.

432
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:45,200
Well, why are you here
then, in my land?

433
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:48,000
Where is your farm,
farmer man?

434
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:51,200
You fought the British
and you lost too, didn't you?

435
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:53,200
You lost.

436
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:55,400
And that's not
all you lost, is it?

437
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:05,100
Where'd you learn
to track a man?

438
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Hey.

439
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,900
Dabe.

440
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:16,600
What do you mean, Dabe?

441
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:20,500
Dabe... my father's
houseboy,

442
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:22,600
old Hottentot.

443
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:26,900
Hottentot.

444
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,900
What's a Hottentot?

445
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,300
A South African bushman.

446
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:33,700
A bushman?
I've never seen one.

447
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:37,500
You never will.
All gone, good as.

448
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:42,300
Like me.

449
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:46,900
As dumb as they are,

450
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:48,900
they will catch you

451
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,600
and probably shoot you.

452
00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:54,600
If I were in your shoes,

453
00:46:54,700 --> 00:46:56,600
which I am,

454
00:46:56,700 --> 00:46:59,200
I'd just worry about
them finding me.

455
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:01,200
You can't run forever.

456
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:03,200
One of us will find you.

457
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:05,800
You best pray
it isn't me.

458
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:17,100
But I'm not the one
who's running.

459
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,500
I think you're the one
who's running away.

460
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:25,500
And I think...

461
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:27,800
I think you left
your soul behind.

462
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:34,000
Now untie these

463
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:36,800
before I break
your bloody neck.

464
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,900
You know, when you sail
for a long time,

465
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,900
you've got to get on
with all the blokes.

466
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,700
If someone
doesn't get on,

467
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:16,200
we just throw them overboard
at the next port.

468
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:17,900
With you,
I don't think

469
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:21,000
we would have waited
till the next port.

470
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:26,000
Your wife...
how did she die?

471
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:31,400
Did she get sick?

472
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:33,500
Did she get sick of you?

473
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,600
I'm sorry.

474
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:02,700
I shouldn't have said that.

475
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:18,800
Thanks.

476
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Walk.

477
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:36,100
- What is this?
- Biltong.

478
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:38,800
I'd rather die
of starvation.

479
00:49:43,700 --> 00:49:45,800
Right here.

480
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:52,800
Something here.

481
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:01,400
Blood.

482
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:03,800
Fighting or...

483
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:07,300
Which way?

484
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,900
Come.

485
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,700
Wouldn't it be easier

486
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:19,600
if we just wait
for the river to calm down?

487
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:22,400
No, I'm not taking chances
with the rain,

488
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:24,400
not in this
bloody country.

489
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:27,700
It's not going to rain.

490
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:29,900
I'm a sailor.
I can tell you the weather

491
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
from the color
of the water.

492
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,500
I lied, okay?
I lied.

493
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:41,500
Come.

494
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:45,000
You're taking me back
to be hanged

495
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:47,300
for something
I didn't even do.

496
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:49,400
Huh?

497
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:51,900
What would you do, huh?
What?

498
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,900
Oh, Mr. Silence now, huh?
Mr. Silence?

499
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,400
You say another word...
I'll hang you myself

500
00:50:57,400 --> 00:50:59,900
from that bloody tree
over there. You follow?

501
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:02,500
Oh, you lie as well.

502
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:03,900
Huh?

503
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,500
Jezus Christus
Allemachtig!

504
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:08,500
You lie just by
saying nothing.

505
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:10,000
In fact,

506
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:12,500
everything you don't say
is one big lie.

507
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:14,800
What in God's name
are you talking about?

508
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:17,800
Well, that's the second
question you've ever asked me.

509
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:19,700
You going to answer it?

510
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:22,500
Well, you just said you'll hang me
if I said another word.

511
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:24,800
Argh!
Come, you, come.

512
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:31,400
Walk.

513
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:50,600
Your wife...

514
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:52,400
she died in that war,
didn't she?

515
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,400
It's none
of your concern.

516
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:56,700
- She did, didn't she?
- It's none of your concern.

517
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:58,400
I was just asking.

518
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:00,400
Why do you...?

519
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:02,300
No.

520
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:04,800
I just...

521
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:07,400
She never died
in no bloody war.

522
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:09,400
But I thought
you said...

523
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:12,300
I don't know how
she died, all right?

524
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:14,300
All right.

525
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:20,600
When the sporting British
couldn't beat us,

526
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:23,200
Lord Kitchener
sent his troops down

527
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:26,200
to burn our farms.

528
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:28,200
He drove our women
and children off

529
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:30,700
like cattle.

530
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:32,700
He penned them

531
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:36,400
in these
barbed-wire camps.

532
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:40,400
I don't know
how they died...

533
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:43,100
sickness, starvation.

534
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:45,700
There's no one left
to tell.

535
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:51,200
Listen, we both
hate the British.

536
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:53,200
I don't hate the British.

537
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:56,000
- Yes, you do.
- I don't hate the British.

538
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,200
I hated my God
for a time.

539
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,300
I stood naked
in front of Him.

540
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:08,900
I reviled Him.
I was so angry.

541
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,700
I thought

542
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:13,500
I knew Him.

543
00:53:15,700 --> 00:53:17,800
Then I remembered

544
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:22,500
that God did not create
the savage in me.

545
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,700
"Though He slay me,

546
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:28,900
yet will I trust
in Him."

547
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:32,900
"But I will maintain
my own ways before Him."

548
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:36,400
Mm.

549
00:53:37,900 --> 00:53:40,200
I still think
you hate the British.

550
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:43,600
You think you can get me
to set you free?

551
00:53:43,700 --> 00:53:45,600
- Well, I don't know.
- You think

552
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:48,200
that if you could make
you and me the same,

553
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:50,900
that would make me
set you free?

554
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:56,400
I fought for something.

555
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:59,900
You're just
a bloody criminal.

556
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,400
I'm not a criminal.

557
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:04,200
You're walking
on my land.

558
00:54:04,300 --> 00:54:08,300
My tupunas named
the mountains and the rivers.

559
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:09,900
It's my lineage.

560
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:15,200
And I saved your life,
bushpig.

561
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:16,700
It's about respect.

562
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:19,000
Let me tell you
about respect.

563
00:54:19,100 --> 00:54:21,000
During the war
me and my men...

564
00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:23,500
we would cut off
the trigger fingers

565
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:26,300
of the bravest British
officers we captured...

566
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:28,500
only the bravest
officers, mind,

567
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:31,400
the ones most worthy
of respect.

568
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:33,500
You understand that?

569
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:37,300
That's what I did
to people I respected.

570
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,100
Doesn't leave much hope
for me then, does it?

571
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:50,100
Hope kills fools like you
every day.

572
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:57,200
Sergeant, let's send
Corporal Crowther

573
00:54:57,300 --> 00:54:58,900
back to base
for fresh provisions.

574
00:54:58,900 --> 00:55:00,900
This is taking a damn sight longer
than I'd hoped.

575
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:02,900
Yes, sir.

576
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,400
You'd better show Crowther
where you think we'll be this evening,

577
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:07,400
'cause I don't
bloody know.

578
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:09,200
It'll just be
a rough guess, Major.

579
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:11,800
Yes, I'm sure it will,
Mr. Bryce.

580
00:55:19,100 --> 00:55:21,100
Do you think
he's got him, sir...

581
00:55:21,100 --> 00:55:23,100
that Van Diemen?

582
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:25,100
Without a doubt.

583
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:27,100
Are the stories they
tell about him true...

584
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:29,800
you know,
butchering our men?

585
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:31,800
Well, let me put it
this way, Private...

586
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:33,400
if it weren't
for the reward,

587
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:35,800
we'd probably be spared the trouble
of executing him.

588
00:55:35,900 --> 00:55:37,800
I reckon that'd
serve him right, sir.

589
00:55:37,900 --> 00:55:39,100
Drake was a good man.

590
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:41,500
Drake was a trousered
ape, Private,

591
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:43,700
a disgrace to his uniform
and his rank.

592
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:45,900
Begging your
pardon, sir,

593
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,300
but he didn't deserve
to die the way he did.

594
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,900
No, you're quite right.

595
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,600
Indeed he didn't.

596
00:55:59,100 --> 00:56:01,500
You haven't seen action yet,
have you, Private?

597
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:05,100
No, sir, not as such.
Not yet.

598
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:07,100
I hope to, sir.

599
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:10,500
A word of caution:

600
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:12,700
Just be sure

601
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:16,600
that when your children
ask you what you did...

602
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:23,100
what you did
in defense of the realm,

603
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:25,800
that you're able to give
them a worthy answer.

604
00:56:25,900 --> 00:56:28,100
I beg your pardon, sir?

605
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:32,600
If he's still alive,
he'll be given a fair trial.

606
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:34,600
If he's guilty,
he'll be hanged.

607
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:36,600
An example
will be made.

608
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:45,500
Te Ara Ruamano.

609
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:49,800
The path of Ruamano.

610
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:54,100
He's like our
spiritual guardian.

611
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:57,900
And he's known to save those
of his people in danger.

612
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,800
What?

613
00:56:59,900 --> 00:57:04,100
This... you pakeha call it
Telson's Gorge.

614
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:14,400
Let me look.

615
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:19,800
Look, you can draw your gun
and shoot me.

616
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:24,700
Don't doubt it.

617
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:27,100
I will shoot you.

618
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:30,600
That bullet will cost you
75 sovereigns.

619
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:33,800
Nice.

620
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:37,900
North, south,

621
00:57:37,900 --> 00:57:39,900
east.

622
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:41,800
Oops.

623
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,800
Damn you.

624
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:48,700
Come.
Come come come.

625
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:51,600
No no, I don't care much
for that idea.

626
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:53,900
- I will let you go.
- Let go.

627
00:57:53,900 --> 00:57:55,200
I'll let you go.

628
00:57:55,300 --> 00:57:57,100
Go ahead, let go.

629
00:57:57,100 --> 00:57:59,100
I swear I'll shoot you.

630
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:02,600
Well, you can try.
But to get your gun,

631
00:58:02,700 --> 00:58:05,000
you're gonna have to let go
of this rope with one hand.

632
00:58:05,100 --> 00:58:07,400
I'll break your bloody neck
if you jump.

633
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:09,500
Or you could
fall in with me.

634
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:12,000
And with that pack,
the rifle

635
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:15,200
and your fat puku,
you could sink and drown.

636
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:17,300
I'll shoot you
as you fall.

637
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:20,100
You might miss.
And I might drown.

638
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:22,600
Ruamano might save me.

639
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:24,600
But we won't know,
will we,

640
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:27,300
until you let go?

641
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:35,900
You wish to fight me?
Come. Come.

642
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:11,100
Get up.
Get up.

643
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:31,600
I'm innocent.

644
01:02:35,500 --> 01:02:37,500
I'm innocent.

645
01:02:57,500 --> 01:02:59,600
What's the matter
with you, eh?

646
01:02:59,700 --> 01:03:02,800
I'm just trying
to uphold the law.

647
01:03:02,900 --> 01:03:04,300
You're a liar.

648
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:06,800
It's got nothing to do
with the law.

649
01:03:06,900 --> 01:03:09,300
It's for money.
You've sold your soul.

650
01:03:09,300 --> 01:03:11,900
You know they're
going to hang me

651
01:03:11,900 --> 01:03:13,900
for something
I didn't even do.

652
01:03:13,900 --> 01:03:15,800
There were witnesses.

653
01:03:15,900 --> 01:03:17,400
Yes, soldiers.

654
01:03:17,500 --> 01:03:18,800
And a woman.

655
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:21,400
She's a pakeha woman
and I'm a Maori.

656
01:03:21,500 --> 01:03:23,400
It was soldiers
who did it.

657
01:03:23,500 --> 01:03:26,200
And it was soldiers
who hung my father.

658
01:03:26,300 --> 01:03:28,400
They made me watch.

659
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:30,100
Then they forced
my head around

660
01:03:30,100 --> 01:03:32,000
and made me watch them
hang my grandfather.

661
01:03:32,100 --> 01:03:34,500
If you kill me,

662
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:37,200
you will condemn yourself.

663
01:03:37,300 --> 01:03:39,300
They will find you,

664
01:03:39,300 --> 01:03:42,000
no matter how long,
how many years...

665
01:03:42,100 --> 01:03:45,800
What's a few years
worth, eh? Eh?

666
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:47,800
What's it worth
to a condemned man?

667
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:49,800
Eh? Argh!

668
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:52,400
Do it. Do it.

669
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:54,900
Do it!

670
01:04:00,100 --> 01:04:02,500
You can't kill me.

671
01:04:02,600 --> 01:04:06,000
You can't do it.

672
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:31,900
Are you all right?

673
01:04:36,300 --> 01:04:38,300
I'm quite well,
Mr. Bryce.

674
01:04:38,300 --> 01:04:40,500
Thank you.

675
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,600
You bloody little Maori.

676
01:04:46,700 --> 01:04:48,700
- That's enough.
- No.

677
01:04:48,700 --> 01:04:50,700
That's enough, Mr. Bryce,

678
01:04:50,700 --> 01:04:53,400
unless you plan to carry
him back to town.

679
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:57,500
Sergeant, tie him up.

680
01:04:57,600 --> 01:04:59,800
Renwick, get the rope

681
01:04:59,900 --> 01:05:01,900
and tie him up.

682
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:05,300
Well, Mr. Van Diemen,
you've obviously endured

683
01:05:05,300 --> 01:05:07,300
- a tough couple of days.
- Yeah, Major.

684
01:05:07,300 --> 01:05:10,700
You needn't fret, sir.
100 sovereigns are yours.

685
01:05:12,300 --> 01:05:15,200
Admirable, most admirable.

686
01:05:30,100 --> 01:05:32,200
Come on, get up.

687
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,400
Get up, you bloody savage.
Renwick, give us a hand.

688
01:05:39,500 --> 01:05:42,200
Get up, your murdering
bastard, you.

689
01:05:42,300 --> 01:05:45,000
Major, with your permission,
if you tie his hands in front of him,

690
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:48,000
it'd help him walk
easier and quicker.

691
01:05:48,100 --> 01:05:50,700
All right. Sergeant, do as
Mr. Van Diemen suggested.

692
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:53,100
Sir.
Renwick.

693
01:06:23,300 --> 01:06:26,500
I didn't expect to see you
until our return, Sergeant Major,

694
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:30,000
Well, sir,
Corporal Crowther said

695
01:06:30,100 --> 01:06:32,800
your orders were for me to bring
supplies with due haste, sir.

696
01:06:32,900 --> 01:06:36,300
I'm sure the corporal
said no such thing.

697
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:39,000
Well, now you're here,
you'd better get about it, I supposed.

698
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:40,800
Just remember,
Sergeant Major,

699
01:06:40,900 --> 01:06:42,800
this is not a vendetta.

700
01:06:56,100 --> 01:06:58,100
Yes, thank you, Saunders.

701
01:06:58,200 --> 01:06:59,700
All right, Sergeant Major.

702
01:07:11,300 --> 01:07:14,600
Tough bastards,
aren't they?

703
01:07:14,600 --> 01:07:17,600
My family fought
against them

704
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:20,000
in the land wars
30 years ago.

705
01:07:21,700 --> 01:07:23,600
Good fighters,

706
01:07:23,700 --> 01:07:26,300
clever as the weasels.

707
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:28,300
You face them doing
one of those godless

708
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:30,300
war-jigs of theirs,

709
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:32,300
their haka,

710
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:34,800
screaming like a pack
of wild dogs,

711
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:37,600
mate, you know
you're in trouble then.

712
01:07:37,700 --> 01:07:40,800
Fierce.
And the women are worse.

713
01:07:40,900 --> 01:07:42,800
Excuse me.

714
01:07:42,900 --> 01:07:45,500
I should know.
I married one.

715
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:55,600
Some meat.

716
01:08:07,700 --> 01:08:09,700
Thank you.

717
01:08:11,900 --> 01:08:14,000
Where's he going?

718
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:17,600
Feeding our meat
to a murderer.

719
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:21,800
What, is he
comforting him?

720
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:24,600
Feeding the savage.

721
01:08:28,700 --> 01:08:31,800
- Thanks.
- Mm?

722
01:08:31,900 --> 01:08:33,900
For this.

723
01:08:38,800 --> 01:08:40,800
You must have been
quite a soldier.

724
01:08:40,800 --> 01:08:43,300
I was never a soldier.

725
01:08:50,800 --> 01:08:53,800
More like...

726
01:08:53,900 --> 01:08:56,400
we were a small rabble.
We stopped the British,

727
01:08:56,500 --> 01:08:59,200
but only
for a short while.

728
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:05,900
You were fighting
for your land,

729
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,400
fighting for your
freedom.

730
01:09:08,500 --> 01:09:10,900
That'll make a soldier
out of a man.

731
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:12,900
Fighting for my freedom?

732
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,200
Well, you were,
weren't you?

733
01:09:18,300 --> 01:09:20,200
I'll tell you
about the freedom

734
01:09:20,300 --> 01:09:22,600
I was fighting for.

735
01:09:25,300 --> 01:09:28,500
Late one morning

736
01:09:28,500 --> 01:09:31,400
the day after New Year's,

737
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:35,000
I was riding home
to my farm.

738
01:09:35,100 --> 01:09:37,900
I saw Dabe
for the last time.

739
01:09:39,500 --> 01:09:42,100
He was hanging
from my neighbor's tree.

740
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:46,900
What, the British
hung your Dabe?

741
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
No.

742
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,900
Not the British.

743
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:55,900
My neighbor...
he hung him

744
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:59,000
for stealing a duck.

745
01:09:59,100 --> 01:10:02,100
82 years old.

746
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:06,000
No old bushman was going
to steal from a white man.

747
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:10,100
My friend...

748
01:10:10,100 --> 01:10:12,800
he hung him from a tree,

749
01:10:12,900 --> 01:10:15,400
left him there
for six months

750
01:10:15,500 --> 01:10:19,500
as an example.

751
01:10:19,500 --> 01:10:22,000
Did you avenge him?

752
01:10:22,100 --> 01:10:24,700
No.

753
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:27,100
I went to war

754
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:29,100
and fought for that
bastard's right

755
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:31,200
to do it again.

756
01:10:33,100 --> 01:10:35,800
That's the freedom
I fought for.

757
01:10:41,800 --> 01:10:45,500
Without freedom
we're nothing.

758
01:10:45,500 --> 01:10:48,000
When they hung
my grandfather,

759
01:10:48,100 --> 01:10:50,700
he called to me...

760
01:10:52,700 --> 01:10:57,400
"It's you now, Kereama.

761
01:10:57,500 --> 01:11:02,300
You must rid us all
of this hara."

762
01:11:02,300 --> 01:11:05,400
The shame?

763
01:11:09,700 --> 01:11:12,600
But I ran away.

764
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:15,100
That's different.

765
01:11:15,200 --> 01:11:17,700
You were only a boy.

766
01:11:20,200 --> 01:11:23,900
That's why
they never hung me.

767
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,100
I wasn't big enough.

768
01:11:27,800 --> 01:11:32,400
Soldiers just threw
the bodies into a hole.

769
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:35,700
I couldn't even
bury them properly.

770
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:42,200
So I ran away.

771
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:48,500
But I always knew
in my heart

772
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:51,300
that I had to come back

773
01:11:51,300 --> 01:11:54,300
and set them free.

774
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:58,100
So that's why
you've come home...

775
01:11:58,200 --> 01:12:01,100
to restore your family honor
and your own?

776
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:12,500
I almost made it.

777
01:12:12,500 --> 01:12:15,400
It's just
beyond that ridge.

778
01:12:17,900 --> 01:12:20,700
But you denied me that.

779
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,400
You denied me that...

780
01:12:28,500 --> 01:12:31,500
you and your Dabe.

781
01:13:26,700 --> 01:13:28,900
Saunders, I think
the prisoner will be fine

782
01:13:28,900 --> 01:13:30,900
without your attention.

783
01:14:23,700 --> 01:14:25,900
Come on, mate.
Come on, get up.

784
01:14:29,700 --> 01:14:32,100
You'll be all right.
Come on.

785
01:14:33,300 --> 01:14:35,200
These ropes
were cut, see?

786
01:14:35,300 --> 01:14:36,800
Mm-hmm.

787
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:40,000
He has a way with rope.

788
01:14:40,100 --> 01:14:42,000
- He has a way with rope?
- Mm-hmm.

789
01:14:42,100 --> 01:14:44,500
What, you knew?

790
01:14:44,600 --> 01:14:46,500
You let him go.

791
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:49,300
It was tough enough
catching him.

792
01:14:49,300 --> 01:14:51,800
In God's name, man,
do you really think I'd let him go?

793
01:14:51,900 --> 01:14:55,200
Well, I'll tell you
one thing for sure:

794
01:14:55,300 --> 01:14:57,800
Somebody let him go,

795
01:14:57,900 --> 01:15:00,200
and in a hurry.

796
01:15:00,300 --> 01:15:03,500
He cut through his
wristband as well.

797
01:15:18,300 --> 01:15:20,000
We'll get him.
We'll get him.

798
01:15:20,100 --> 01:15:21,500
How is he, Sergeant?

799
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:24,400
The savage beat him
pretty bad, sir, but he'll be okay.

800
01:15:24,500 --> 01:15:26,500
Mr. Bryce.

801
01:15:27,700 --> 01:15:29,700
How long?

802
01:15:29,700 --> 01:15:31,900
Two, three hours perhaps.

803
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,800
But he's in bad condition.

804
01:15:34,900 --> 01:15:37,700
He'll leave an easy trail.
He won't get far.

805
01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:39,700
Van Diemen?

806
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:43,200
Mr. Bryce knows
his business.

807
01:15:43,300 --> 01:15:45,700
If you'll excuse me,
gentlemen,

808
01:15:45,700 --> 01:15:48,600
but I have a score
to settle.

809
01:16:29,200 --> 01:16:32,200
Right, we'll leave
camp here.

810
01:16:32,300 --> 01:16:34,900
Major Carlysle, sir.

811
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:36,900
This had better be
important, Saunders.

812
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,400
I just wanted
to ask, sir,

813
01:16:39,500 --> 01:16:41,600
now that the prisoner
is armed, what your...

814
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:43,600
Armed?

815
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:45,900
How armed?

816
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:49,000
Did Sergeant Leybourne
not bring it to your attention, sir?

817
01:16:49,100 --> 01:16:52,400
The prisoner made off
with Renwick's rifle.

818
01:17:04,600 --> 01:17:06,600
Unfortunately, it would appear

819
01:17:06,600 --> 01:17:08,400
that the niceties of justice
are fast becoming

820
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:11,000
a luxury we can
no longer afford.

821
01:17:11,100 --> 01:17:13,500
You have my permission
to shoot him on sight.

822
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:16,400
However, this is not
to be a game.

823
01:17:16,500 --> 01:17:18,700
There's no place here
for sport.

824
01:17:18,700 --> 01:17:20,800
I'll see court-martialed
any man

825
01:17:20,900 --> 01:17:23,400
who doesn't kill him cleanly
with the first shot.

826
01:17:23,400 --> 01:17:25,700
Do you understand?

827
01:17:25,800 --> 01:17:27,800
Mr. Bryce.

828
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:58,900
Mr. Bryce.

829
01:19:00,300 --> 01:19:02,600
He could have gone
one of two ways.

830
01:19:02,600 --> 01:19:04,600
Take the wrong one...

831
01:19:04,600 --> 01:19:06,800
- Mr. Bryce, please don't tell me...
- I'll find him.

832
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:08,800
Well, do so,
and quickly.

833
01:22:10,500 --> 01:22:13,200
This is a sacred place...

834
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:17,800
the home of Ruamano.

835
01:22:19,900 --> 01:22:21,800
I would come here
with my grandfather

836
01:22:21,900 --> 01:22:24,100
when I was a little boy.

837
01:22:24,100 --> 01:22:26,900
I'd have to wait outside

838
01:22:26,900 --> 01:22:29,400
while he entered
into the cave

839
01:22:29,500 --> 01:22:32,500
to talk to our
spiritual guardians.

840
01:22:34,700 --> 01:22:37,300
Now it is my time...

841
01:22:37,400 --> 01:22:39,800
time to redeem the mana

842
01:22:39,900 --> 01:22:42,500
of my fathers.

843
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,600
There's only one way
out of here.

844
01:25:54,700 --> 01:25:58,000
You know this camp.

845
01:25:58,100 --> 01:26:00,200
Bryce has lost the track,

846
01:26:00,200 --> 01:26:02,000
but only for a while.
That won't last.

847
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:12,000
We have to get you
out of here.

848
01:26:12,100 --> 01:26:14,700
Believe me, they will
shoot you down.

849
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:17,800
I'm still curious
to know

850
01:26:17,900 --> 01:26:19,800
why you cut
the trigger fingers

851
01:26:19,900 --> 01:26:21,800
off the British
soldiers.

852
01:26:21,900 --> 01:26:24,700
God tells us it is a sin
to kill other men

853
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:26,900
unless you are
protecting your home

854
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:28,900
and your loved ones.

855
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:32,400
It stopped good men
from sinning again.

856
01:26:49,800 --> 01:26:51,800
Get up.

857
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:12,900
Come.

858
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:21,500
Bryce was better than...
than you thought.

859
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:23,500
There's plenty of cover.
If we split up,

860
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:25,500
we can get around them.

861
01:27:25,600 --> 01:27:27,400
But they'll just keep on
following us.

862
01:27:27,400 --> 01:27:29,200
They haven't got us yet.

863
01:27:29,300 --> 01:27:31,800
Look, I can't run. I can't climb.
There's no way around them.

864
01:27:31,900 --> 01:27:34,300
- You have to.
- I can't run.

865
01:27:36,900 --> 01:27:39,200
We may not have to.

866
01:27:40,400 --> 01:27:42,400
It's your life.

867
01:27:42,400 --> 01:27:44,700
No, it's your life too.

868
01:27:44,700 --> 01:27:46,700
And I'm not a killer.

869
01:27:46,700 --> 01:27:49,600
We can fight.
Ja?

870
01:28:10,500 --> 01:28:13,100
I need you to do
one thing...

871
01:28:13,100 --> 01:28:15,100
one great thing.

872
01:28:18,100 --> 01:28:19,200
No.

873
01:28:19,300 --> 01:28:20,400
You must.

874
01:28:20,400 --> 01:28:22,400
I won't do it.

875
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:25,200
You must help me on my
journey to Hawaiki.

876
01:28:25,300 --> 01:28:26,500
What?

877
01:28:26,600 --> 01:28:29,700
It's the final resting place
for our people.

878
01:28:29,800 --> 01:28:31,700
Don't let them hang me.

879
01:28:31,800 --> 01:28:34,400
I don't want to die
like my fathers,

880
01:28:34,400 --> 01:28:37,200
hung from some post
without mana,

881
01:28:37,300 --> 01:28:40,100
without dignity.

882
01:28:57,300 --> 01:28:59,900
I'll take it from you.

883
01:29:55,100 --> 01:29:57,500
Saunders, Bryce,
round to the right.

884
01:29:59,200 --> 01:30:01,200
Sergeant, with me.

885
01:30:13,100 --> 01:30:14,600
Damn.

886
01:30:17,300 --> 01:30:18,900
Van Diemen.

887
01:30:27,800 --> 01:30:31,400
Another trophy
for His Majesty's justice.

888
01:30:41,300 --> 01:30:43,200
He had courage.

889
01:30:43,300 --> 01:30:45,700
He needs respect.

890
01:30:54,300 --> 01:30:57,500
Not your soundest economic
decision, Van Diemen.

891
01:30:57,600 --> 01:30:58,900
I have a little saved.

892
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:02,000
Bugger that.
I'd rather have his head.

893
01:31:02,100 --> 01:31:03,500
The price will be
on your own.

894
01:31:03,500 --> 01:31:05,200
Yeah.

895
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:32,100
We have to take
the body back.

896
01:31:32,100 --> 01:31:34,100
At least have your men
bury him, Carlysle.

897
01:31:34,200 --> 01:31:36,500
We cannot leave him here.

898
01:31:36,500 --> 01:31:38,500
I'm sorry,
Mr. Van Diemen.

899
01:31:38,500 --> 01:31:40,500
Enough time has been
spent on this.

900
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:57,400
- There you go.
- Thank you, Murray.

901
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,300
You think Bridget
will like it here?

902
01:32:01,300 --> 01:32:03,300
Without a doubt, sir.

903
01:32:03,300 --> 01:32:05,800
I've ordered the linen
you requested, sir.

904
01:32:05,900 --> 01:32:08,800
It'll be here in plenty of time
for your wife's arrival.

905
01:32:18,500 --> 01:32:20,300
He's alive.

906
01:32:20,300 --> 01:32:23,400
Sergeant!
Sergeant Leybourne.

907
01:32:23,400 --> 01:32:25,400
I want a man in every
port, every harbor

908
01:32:25,400 --> 01:32:28,500
on the lookout for a Maori with his
right index finger missing.

909
01:32:28,600 --> 01:32:32,000
Now, damn it. I want him arrested
and brought here alive.

910
01:33:06,700 --> 01:33:08,600
Van Diemen.

911
01:33:08,700 --> 01:33:11,100
Major.

912
01:33:11,100 --> 01:33:13,100
I heard you were
leaving us.

913
01:33:13,100 --> 01:33:15,800
This country has
no interest for me.

914
01:33:21,300 --> 01:33:24,000
Australia?

915
01:33:24,100 --> 01:33:26,800
There's a place they've named
Van Diemen's Land there.

916
01:33:26,900 --> 01:33:29,800
Mm, I like
the sound of it.

917
01:33:29,800 --> 01:33:31,800
Leaving without
your reward?

918
01:33:34,200 --> 01:33:36,100
Thank you.

919
01:33:36,200 --> 01:33:38,200
There we go.

920
01:33:38,200 --> 01:33:40,900
25 sovereigns.

921
01:33:43,300 --> 01:33:45,900
It could have been
four times that.

922
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:47,900
Mm.

923
01:33:51,100 --> 01:33:53,800
He's alive, isn't he?

924
01:33:56,500 --> 01:33:58,400
It must have been
like old times for you.

925
01:33:58,500 --> 01:34:01,500
He didn't even scream
when you cut his finger off.

926
01:34:33,600 --> 01:34:36,000
I suppose you have
your reasons.

927
01:34:36,100 --> 01:34:39,900
I suppose I'll never quite
understand what they are.

928
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:45,300
It's quite the sum.

929
01:34:45,400 --> 01:34:47,800
But why so generous?

930
01:34:50,300 --> 01:34:53,100
You were there,
weren't you?

931
01:34:58,200 --> 01:35:01,300
Did you give the order?

932
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:06,500
Did you give the order
to burn down my farm?

933
01:35:09,100 --> 01:35:11,200
No, I did not.

934
01:35:14,800 --> 01:35:16,800
Oh.

935
01:35:20,400 --> 01:35:25,000
Tell me one thing:

936
01:35:25,100 --> 01:35:27,900
Was anybody
in the house

937
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:31,100
when you watched it
burn to ash?

938
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:34,900
No.

939
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,700
I can assure you of that.

940
01:35:39,300 --> 01:35:42,000
Sir. Sir, we're ready.

941
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,200
The captain's gonna be
wanting to weigh anchor.

942
01:35:46,300 --> 01:35:48,300
Yeah.

943
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
Major.

944
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:55,700
Van Diemen.

945
01:36:10,700 --> 01:36:13,000
You know, I've sent
messengers to every port,

946
01:36:13,100 --> 01:36:15,400
every whaling station.

947
01:36:29,700 --> 01:36:32,200
Seen one of these before?

948
01:36:34,800 --> 01:36:38,100
At most you've bought him
a few weeks,

949
01:36:38,100 --> 01:36:40,100
perhaps a few days.

950
01:36:40,100 --> 01:36:43,800
I sincerely hope
it was worth it.

951
01:36:43,900 --> 01:36:46,200
Do you know
what a few days of life

952
01:36:46,300 --> 01:36:48,400
means to a condemned man?

953
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,100
Right about there.
