1
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:19,693
I'll never manage to do it!

2
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,818
Faster Farfella!

3
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,455
Come on!

4
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:30,935
Good!

5
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,653
I can't do it, Karas!

6
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:48,254
I can't do it!

7
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:51,090
Run!

8
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,010
Run away!

9
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:24,690
I like to be pretty everyday.

10
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:26,778
I like to be in good shape.

11
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:29,811
That's why I love Avalon.

12
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:33,297
With Avalon,
I know I'm beautiful.

13
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:36,015
And I know I'll remain that way.

14
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:39,379
Avalon,
for a better world.

15
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:41,369
Health...

16
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:42,775
Beauty...

17
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:44,499
Longevity.

18
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,169
Avalon...

19
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:49,577
We're on your side for life.

20
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:53,812
I already paid you, didn't I?

21
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,569
Give it to me!

22
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:00,572
Sorry, beauty.

23
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:04,292
I've had... 
a few extra expenses.

24
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:13,570
Hey!

25
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,457
Your sister is with Dimitri.

26
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:20,294
Don't play this game with me!

27
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:25,538
You have to pay the price
if you want it!

28
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:26,815
Let go of her!

29
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:28,770
Baby!

30
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:29,970
Out!

31
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:32,295
Get lost!

32
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:40,016
What are you doing here?

33
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,055
Good evening, Bislane.
Stop it, Ilona.

34
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,774
What were you doing?

35
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:48,132
We didn't see you at the office.

36
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:49,933
Cut out the acting!

37
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:52,735
When I find you a good job

38
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:55,858
you could go there at least
2 days in a row.

39
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,649
They're going to fire you.

40
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:59,732
How awful!

41
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:02,854
We can never tell you anything Bislane.

42
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,774
You never talk.

43
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:10,855
They're waiting for you
at the poorhouse.

44
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:46,855
Ah!

45
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:52,296
Illitch!

46
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:56,336
Illitch!

47
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:26,819
Hurry up, we're waiting for you!

48
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:39,976
Section K, in position.

49
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:55,969
Hostage in danger!

50
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,369
Fall back.

51
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:04,654
I don't think so.

52
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:06,135
Fall back!

53
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,490
Hostage in danger!
Karas!

54
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:09,889
Are you crazy?

55
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:35,649
Is there a problem?

56
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,289
It'll be over soon.

57
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:48,893
Close your eyes,

58
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:50,733
..I'll tell you
when you can open them.

59
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:52,289
Close your eyes.

60
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:55,296
What?

61
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:18,974
Let's go!

62
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:51,532
Amiel, is your wife feeling better?

63
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:55,492
Whereas I'm away..

64
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,970
..or present,
it's infernal.

65
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:01,219
I'll be glad when 
she'll have the baby.

66
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:05,215
Captain.

67
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:09,408
The prosecutor is waiting
for you outside.

68
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:30,095
Ilona Tasuiev, one of Avalon's
youngest researcher.

69
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:31,938
Outstandingly intelligent.

70
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:34,489
Recruted in Caucasus
when she was 13 years old.

71
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:37,977
The favourite of vice-president
Paul Dellenbach.

72
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:40,775
Avalon wants us to find her,

73
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,772
..to find her alive.

74
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:45,250
Sort things out yourself but
bring her back to me.

75
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,930
Do you actually never talk
or is it...

76
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:51,938
to stick to your character?

77
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:13,019
Ilona Tasuiev, this young
22 years old scientist,

78
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:17,618
promised to a brilliant future,
has been kidnapped

79
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:21,939
while on her way to help
underprivileged people.

80
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:25,580
Can Avalon accept this?

81
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:26,770
No!

82
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:30,018
We've always considered such acts,

83
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:34,054
to harm any of our employees,

84
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:39,255
as a personal attack against
the whole company.

85
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:44,934
Ilona's sister.

86
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:48,852
Bislane Tasuiev.
She's working for Avalon,

87
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:51,410
at the archives.
Ilona saw her...

88
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:53,253
just before being kidnapped.

89
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:57,618
It's Dr Muller, her superior,
who gave the alert.

90
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:00,171
As for the 71,
it's the jungle.

91
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,218
4 homicides, 32 complaints...

92
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:07,454
Are you listening?

93
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:10,409
I'll see her later.

94
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:12,769
Tell her!

95
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:20,211
I want to know everything
about her.

96
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:24,773
Habits, vices, obsessions,
strengths, weaknesses.

97
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:27,654
Her colleagues, her friends, her lovers.

98
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:30,448
Avalon must give us her schedules

99
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:33,089
and her current works.
As well as

100
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:35,012
the list of her patients.

101
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:37,649
Put some pressure.
The narcotics will

102
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:40,335
tip us on the 71.

103
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:41,933
Without a ransom demand,

104
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:44,654
we shouldn't neglect any lead:
industrial espionage,

105
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:46,493
robbery, sexual crime.

106
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:50,455
The kidnapper bypassed the watchmen

107
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:52,816
and security cameras.

108
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:55,608
He's fast,
calculating and organised.

109
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:57,489
It's not

110
00:13:57,780 --> 00:13:59,611
his first kidnapping.
Amiel...

111
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:02,408
Check the convicts, the psychopaths

112
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,292
and those released on parole.
Montoya.

113
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:06,172
Check Ilona's car.

114
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,730
Contact Gavary
and Lionet at the Casbah.

115
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:10,818
If the car appears somewhere,

116
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:12,368
they'll know about it.

117
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:13,530
Is it clear?

118
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,291
We find the girl
then we can rest.

119
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:29,009
Does anyone know where she went?

120
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:48,850
Woeller?

121
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:52,417
Sport shoes, size 38. 

122
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:55,618
Considering the footprints
the kidnapper must weight around 60kg.

123
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:57,898
A woman.
Or a teenager.

124
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:00,250
Make a DNA search

125
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:02,730
on everything we found.

126
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:05,369
Cigarette butts, various wrappings.

127
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:07,617
I have some information about Muller.

128
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:11,489
He was a researcher in genetics for Avalon.

129
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:14,971
I'm switching to e-call.
When his brother died

130
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,255
he quit everything

131
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,178
to take care of

132
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,890
the underprivileged in an
Avalon's clinic.

133
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:23,739
Dog hair...

134
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,254
here and there...

135
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:27,935
I found some old underwears.

136
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:35,254
A lil' tip?

137
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:44,213
She's working at Avalon's laboratory.

138
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:47,850
But Ilona is regularly 
on duty here

139
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,499
during her free time.

140
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:52,331
There are better things
to do to relax.

141
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:57,130
Facing reality puts 
ideas back in place.

142
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:01,175
Genetic exploration is hazardous.

143
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:03,650
I've known more hazardous things.

144
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:07,732
Research is a never ending fight.

145
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:09,615
Lose its the purpose

146
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:12,334
and you'll lose its meaning.

147
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:13,935
That's why I'm pushing

148
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:16,575
young people to 
get their hands dirty.

149
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:20,574
Is it the reason you quit?

150
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:23,931
You did your duty.

151
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:28,179
I realized I'd be more useful here

152
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,218
than in a laboratory.

153
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:32,617
You're still working

154
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:34,009
for Avalon.

155
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:36,729
It's difficult to get away
from Avalon.

156
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,092
You called

157
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:43,614
the police at 0h34.

158
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:46,848
A 22 years old girl
is 20 minutes late.

159
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,933
Don't you think it was a bit
too fast to sound the alarm?

160
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:52,609
Unfortunately I think I was right.

161
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:56,540
She's never been late.

162
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:58,293
Not even for a minute.

163
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:04,656
Ilona made big sacrifices
to succeed.

164
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,976
She would have never given up.

165
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:10,974
She's an exceptional woman.
And beautiful.

166
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:13,296
You don't miss a thing, Karas.

167
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:16,409
Do doctors make you nervous?

168
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:21,253
No, hospitals do.
We all have our bad memories.

169
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:25,612
I'm done Cecilia.
Very well doctor.

170
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:26,730
Thank you.

171
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:30,413
One last thing:

172
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:34,411
What's the subject of Ilona's research?

173
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:38,418
She's preparing a biogenetics Ph.D.

174
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:42,890
About progeria.
An abnormality provoking

175
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:45,859
premature ageing.

176
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:48,250
A disease affecting children.

177
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:52,449
A tough fight I used 
to carry on myself.

178
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:55,693
It was a long time ago.

179
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:02,175
Come!

180
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:46,617
Did you miss me?
Karas!

181
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,611
I hate it when you come here.

182
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:51,532
Me too.
So?

183
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:56,735
Nobody knows anything about the girl.

184
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:59,620
Her sister is often 
at the Zbench and at the 71.

185
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:01,373
I don't give a shit about the sister.

186
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,691
I've got nothing else.
Zilch!

187
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:06,090
Your blonde just vanished.

188
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:08,172
You're the magician, Goran.

189
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,569
I'm doing all I can.

190
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:12,293
Ok! Ok, Ok!

191
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:16,688
I know someone,
a Romanian, she's a clairvoyant.

192
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:18,896
She knows crazy stuff!

193
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,858
You're...

194
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:32,619
Follow the sister and gather
anything that might be interesting.

195
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:35,934
Starting with

196
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:37,289
my own pleasure?

197
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:52,210
My sweet little princess!

198
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:00,415
Champagne?

199
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:12,298
Where is she, Dimitri?

200
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:17,932
What are you plotting with her?

201
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:21,609
Ah, ah, ah!

202
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:26,172
You really think I'm the one...

203
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:31,616
What would I do with such
a pain in the ass?

204
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:37,136
I thought you were here for me!

205
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:39,212
Don't take me for a damn fool!

206
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:41,373
I saw you together last night.

207
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:42,695
Did you forget?

208
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:46,097
Ah yes?

209
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:48,896
And...

210
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:51,250
I haven't talked to the cops yet.

211
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:52,456
Not yet.

212
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:17,451
That's what she wanted.

213
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:28,777
I was supposed to steal it for her.

214
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:30,255
What?

215
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:31,615
What is it?

216
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:39,697
She didn't pay me

217
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:41,612
the last instalment.

218
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:46,610
Health

219
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:48,575
Beauty...

220
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:50,339
Longevity...

221
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:51,769
Avalon...

222
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:55,769
We're on your side for life.

223
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:00,730
Let go of me!

224
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,696
Let go of me!
Calm down.

225
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:05,493
I won't

226
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:07,697
hurt you.
It's already done.

227
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:08,930
Ah!

228
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:15,215
Where were you?

229
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:18,418
Do you think I kidnapped her?
You tell me.

230
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:20,688
You're the cop!

231
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:26,738
Stop running me around!

232
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:28,294
You found me.

233
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:30,813
Are you always

234
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:34,331
so aggressive?
Only when my sister is kidnapped.

235
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:48,935
We've always been very different.

236
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:52,771
Even when we were children.
Before the death of our parents.

237
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:55,696
Did they die during the war?

238
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:05,452
I was 15 years old,
Ilona was only 10.

239
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:09,370
I took care of her after that.

240
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,415
We're very close to each other.

241
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:13,253
But it's complicated.

242
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:27,014
Avalon noticed her,
she was

243
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:29,934
13 years old.
They took us here.

244
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,776
We would still be there

245
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:34,971
without her.
And Dellenbach?

246
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:36,859
He changed her.

247
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:39,817
She has faith in her.

248
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:42,818
Talk to me about Dr Muller.

249
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:50,015
She met him when she started
her Ph.D.

250
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:53,696
He offered to help her in exchange
of some duty at the clinic.

251
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,936
They admire each other.

252
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,249
Anything else?

253
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:16,009
Let me known if there's anything else.

254
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:18,338
Don't hide anything.

255
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:20,652
Or I'll know it sooner or later.

256
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:26,691
Can I stay here tonight?

257
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:30,491
This way I'll know where to find you.

258
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:56,179
She's an...

259
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:57,893
exceptional woman.

260
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,091
I know you can hear me.

261
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:11,099
I can feel your presence.

262
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:14,573
Answer me!

263
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:25,779
My name is... Ilona Tasuiev.

264
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:30,571
I'm 22 years old, 22!

265
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:35,659
I want to live!

266
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:45,250
Pssshhh!

267
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:15,815
Hmmm...

268
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:52,578
Greetings, captain.
Welcome to Avalon.

269
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:55,859
Your gun and your e-call, please.

270
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:13,529
The legendary

271
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:15,179
captain Karas.

272
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:21,930
Nice to meet you.

273
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:24,728
I've heard a lot about you.

274
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:35,011
No news?
None.

275
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,377
At least for now.

276
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:40,330
This situation is intolerable.

277
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:42,810
If I may...

278
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:45,056
Sorry, was Ilona working

279
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:47,291
on a confidential project?

280
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:50,139
Like all our researchers

281
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:53,497
she does her best to improve
the life of all the people.

282
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:58,209
Anything else?

283
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:06,257
Is Ilona Tasuiev your mistress?

284
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:17,815
I knew you were a direct man.

285
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:24,170
Hmmm!

286
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:29,056
I have sex with my secretary,
my wife.

287
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:31,371
And even my wife's sister.

288
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:34,057
But with my scientists,

289
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:36,335
never.

290
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:44,138
Goran is looking for you!

291
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:46,217
There's a problem with the sister.

292
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:00,890
Poor kid!

293
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:03,614
What's so important in this book?

294
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:06,335
You're raising your child with love

295
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:08,491
and look how he ends.

296
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:10,888
Shut up.

297
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:15,052
Don't you know how yours
will end, do you?

298
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:18,218
Karas should sign the report.

299
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:20,094
After you.

300
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,292
There was a Japanese.

301
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:26,453
Children lined up

302
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:28,850
just like on a class photo.

303
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:32,053
There was a date on the cover, 2006.

304
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:34,289
That's all?

305
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:37,094
That's all he let me see.

306
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:40,849
I'll trust you,

307
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:42,493
I have no other choice.

308
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:44,139
But if you hide

309
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:45,734
something else...

310
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:47,658
We got Ilona's car.

311
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:49,295
We found it.

312
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:06,328
The car

313
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:09,618
is given chase to,
unknown driver.

314
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:15,098
It's heading towards the center.

315
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:20,699
Karas, do you copy?

316
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:33,333
It's going

317
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:35,139
to the center.

318
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:49,170
Damn!

319
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:51,058
Move away, fuck!

320
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:54,538
Take the Pont des Arts.

321
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:04,056
Come on!

322
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:45,372
Welcome to the Galeries Lafayette
Notre-Dame.

323
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:47,059
Leaving for the week-end...

324
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:02,296
Move away!

325
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:29,088
We finally got him!

326
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:31,616
He's one of Farfella's henchmen.

327
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:35,248
It's Farfella who's
gonna be happy!

328
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:36,416
So?

329
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:39,213
It's a 42 and a half.

330
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:42,213
It's not him.
Shit!

331
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:45,173
Where did he get the car?
He won't talk.

332
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:46,648
We must wait 

333
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:48,971
for his lawyer.
Karas!

334
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:56,774
Don't leave me alone
with this lunatic!

335
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:01,452
I don't know this chick!

336
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:03,335
Come here!

337
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:06,260
I swear, I don't know anything!

338
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:10,691
What about paying a visit to Farfella?

339
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:06,658
Salam aleikum, Farfella.

340
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:09,096
Aleikum salam, Karas.

341
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:11,617
Once every 20 years.

342
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:13,612
We don't see each other very often.

343
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:16,258
You put on some weight.

344
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:20,250
I always wanted to look like you.

345
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:39,095
It's your turn to
honor your debt.

346
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:41,936
How nice of you!

347
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:44,539
You brought me

348
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:45,969
a present!

349
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:48,295
Hmmm...

350
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:52,738
You know that Naghib

351
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:54,732
has nothing to do with it.

352
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:57,494
You know that he stole the car.

353
00:39:58,300 --> 00:39:59,255
Where? When?

354
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:02,856
How? You'd better tell me right now.

355
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:06,693
You forgot to say "please".

356
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:25,570
Hmmm!

357
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:29,173
Security cameras

358
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:31,013
in one of my parkings.

359
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:33,172
you should find something
of interest in it.

360
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:36,531
May the Prophet be with you.

361
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:23,136
32 exploitable comparison parameters.

362
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:26,094
Enough for a visual identification.

363
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:29,535
Switch to the convicts file.

364
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:41,455
Search all files.

365
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:43,213
Witnesses, suspects.

366
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:51,379
Shit!
I can't believe it.

367
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:53,173
General identification.

368
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:57,493
Send the picture to
Avalon and Muller.

369
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:01,055
Widen the search
if we don't find anything.

370
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:03,291
Army, Health.
Top priority.

371
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:05,053
Nora, take over.

372
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:23,415
More secrets?

373
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:25,571
I never saw this guy.

374
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:27,333
Not even in the book.

375
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:28,809
I'm sure of it.

376
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:30,255
Whose book was it?

377
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:31,973
What was Ilona looking for?

378
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:35,658
Repeating your questions
won't do you any good!

379
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:42,895
I was wrong to cover up for Dimitri.

380
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:46,453
I didn't want to give him away
without being sure.

381
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:48,133
You can understand, can't you?

382
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:50,815
To protect such a scumbag?

383
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:56,170
He wasn't always like that.

384
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:00,379
This investigation will be very difficult

385
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:03,134
with friends like that.

386
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:06,978
What about you, Karas?

387
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:10,938
Do you always meet perfect women?

388
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:12,090
No.

389
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:15,578
You're wasting your time
in this shitty world.

390
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:21,376
This shitty world,
it's the only one

391
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:22,888
I know.

392
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:29,774
If you know of a better one
I'll take it.

393
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:35,697
We must have missed something.

394
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:38,090
It's here somewhere.

395
00:43:38,580 --> 00:43:40,172
We'll inevitably find out.

396
00:43:56,140 --> 00:43:57,175
This way!

397
00:43:57,460 --> 00:43:58,131
Move it!

398
00:44:21,820 --> 00:44:22,855
Hands up!

399
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:25,051
Igor Vord?

400
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:27,369
You're under arrest!

401
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:28,410
No!

402
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:31,412
Him, not Igor!

403
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:32,974
Igor Vord, where?

404
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:35,250
Igor!

405
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:37,410
Igor!

406
00:44:57,700 --> 00:44:58,769
2 more names

407
00:44:59,060 --> 00:45:02,769
for the same face
on different metro-passes.

408
00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:05,052
We're right in the middle

409
00:45:05,380 --> 00:45:06,779
of an identity traffic.

410
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:20,850
Er...

411
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:23,854
Absolutely, captain.
Er... Vord,

412
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:27,018
Novalis and Hemen.
All incinerated here.

413
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:30,778
Igor Vord, 10 years ago,
in march 44.

414
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:32,334
Thomas Hemen,
5 years ago.

415
00:45:32,660 --> 00:45:35,618
Alfred Novalis will be incinerated

416
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:38,090
next month.
As you can see

417
00:45:38,420 --> 00:45:41,492
everything is noted here.
Those deaths weren't registered.

418
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:45,256
According to my report
the hospital took care of them.

419
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:48,094
You can have a look by yourself.

420
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:53,733
Burial certificate sent
by Avalon's clinic.

421
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:56,534
Everything is in order.
The same doctor

422
00:45:56,860 --> 00:45:58,293
signed for the 3 of them.

423
00:45:58,700 --> 00:45:59,974
Dr Muller.

424
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:09,011
Nora, call Reparaz,
we're going to Muller's place.

425
00:46:19,420 --> 00:46:20,853
We're gonna lose him if

426
00:46:21,180 --> 00:46:22,056
we don't act now.

427
00:46:22,340 --> 00:46:25,218
He knows we're making some progress,
he has the picture of the kidnapper.

428
00:46:25,540 --> 00:46:26,859
You have nothing.

429
00:46:27,140 --> 00:46:29,529
Muller signed the 3
burial certificates.

430
00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:32,169
He's signing 300 of them a year!
A fuck up

431
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:34,491
will be his lawyers delight.

432
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:37,489
I don't give a fuck,
I want a warrant!

433
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:42,899
It's 5 in the morning.

434
00:46:43,220 --> 00:46:44,972
I need at least 1h.

435
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:50,695
Karas!

436
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:52,136
Listen!

437
00:46:52,420 --> 00:46:54,376
I'll get you
if you go in!

438
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:55,975
Karas!

439
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:45,451
Police!

440
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:44,135
Amiel...

441
00:49:45,180 --> 00:49:48,456
Investigate on Muller
and Avalon, year 2006.

442
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:52,180
Report anything you can find.

443
00:49:53,180 --> 00:49:55,535
Why don't we have this kind of stuff?

444
00:50:14,460 --> 00:50:15,575
Remain calm.

445
00:50:17,020 --> 00:50:19,659
They pirated my e-call,
they shot me!

446
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:22,414
I want a warrant for
arrest for Dellenbach.

447
00:50:22,740 --> 00:50:24,571
You don't have any evidence.

448
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:27,176
They were Avalon's men!

449
00:50:28,420 --> 00:50:31,856
You break into Muller's house
and you kill 2 men.

450
00:50:32,140 --> 00:50:33,937
Do you want to be decorated?

451
00:50:35,420 --> 00:50:39,572
Muller is behind Ilona's kidnapping
and Avalon is covering up for him.

452
00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:42,177
What's your share in this?

453
00:50:44,580 --> 00:50:45,774
What are you saying?

454
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:51,850
You're suspended.

455
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:03,616
Hmmm!

456
00:51:28,124 --> 00:51:29,955
Nice show!

457
00:51:31,284 --> 00:51:32,353
Go fuck yourself.

458
00:51:32,964 --> 00:51:34,317
You're not alone.

459
00:51:36,444 --> 00:51:38,355
You have a team with you.

460
00:51:44,404 --> 00:51:47,476
You were right about the
metro-passes.

461
00:51:48,204 --> 00:51:51,116
They've been used around
Muller's district.

462
00:51:52,324 --> 00:51:55,077
I gathered all I could about 2006.

463
00:51:55,804 --> 00:51:59,319
Muller was one of Avalon's greatest hope.

464
00:52:00,084 --> 00:52:03,315
He quit everything
after his brother's death.

465
00:52:03,964 --> 00:52:06,114
He tried everything to save him.

466
00:52:06,444 --> 00:52:09,595
But Claus was infected
by an incurable disease.

467
00:52:10,884 --> 00:52:12,078
Progeria.

468
00:52:15,924 --> 00:52:16,913
Muller?

469
00:52:17,244 --> 00:52:19,553
It doesn't make any sense.
He took advantage of

470
00:52:19,884 --> 00:52:22,796
his situation
to steal identities.

471
00:52:23,124 --> 00:52:25,274
The book belonged to him.

472
00:52:25,604 --> 00:52:27,083
Muller is involved.

473
00:52:27,484 --> 00:52:28,633
Why Ilona?

474
00:52:28,964 --> 00:52:31,398
She discovered something about him

475
00:52:31,684 --> 00:52:33,197
during her research.

476
00:52:34,524 --> 00:52:35,479
I must find out

477
00:52:35,764 --> 00:52:37,720
what happened in 2006.

478
00:52:37,964 --> 00:52:40,637
Why did Ilona want
this book so badly?

479
00:52:41,844 --> 00:52:43,516
But I need you

480
00:52:44,644 --> 00:52:45,918
for that.

481
00:52:47,524 --> 00:52:48,354
What?

482
00:52:48,964 --> 00:52:52,320
Avalon archives?
You hate your job.

483
00:52:53,204 --> 00:52:54,637
It's too dangerous.

484
00:52:55,764 --> 00:52:57,720
It never stopped you.

485
00:53:40,564 --> 00:53:41,314
Where are you?

486
00:53:43,284 --> 00:53:44,763
I'm heading to

487
00:53:45,084 --> 00:53:46,403
the archives.

488
00:53:52,284 --> 00:53:53,603
It's fine, I see you.

489
00:54:27,284 --> 00:54:28,080
Ah!

490
00:54:42,844 --> 00:54:44,880
Do you understand,
I...

491
00:55:03,804 --> 00:55:04,759
I'm there.

492
00:55:05,564 --> 00:55:07,555
Good, now be very careful.

493
00:55:14,684 --> 00:55:18,643
I can see everything
Ilona consulted on 2006.

494
00:55:18,964 --> 00:55:21,558
Focus on progeria and Muller.

495
00:55:21,924 --> 00:55:24,392
Oh shit,
an alpha confidential!

496
00:55:25,004 --> 00:55:26,801
What?
A secured file.

497
00:55:27,124 --> 00:55:28,477
I can check it

498
00:55:28,764 --> 00:55:31,597
but I'll be discovered.
Too dangerous.

499
00:55:31,924 --> 00:55:33,357
It never stopped me.

500
00:55:40,964 --> 00:55:41,714
There's...

501
00:55:43,684 --> 00:55:48,155
Children who all carry
a mark on the back of the skull.

502
00:55:50,764 --> 00:55:52,436
A triangular scar.

503
00:55:53,164 --> 00:55:54,756
What did they do to them?

504
00:55:56,684 --> 00:56:00,518
We put a definitive end
to Muller's protocol.

505
00:56:00,844 --> 00:56:02,994
He's the guy on the book.

506
00:56:03,324 --> 00:56:05,599
Dr Nakata.
Our supply of patients depleted

507
00:56:05,924 --> 00:56:08,677
after these deaths.

508
00:56:09,804 --> 00:56:12,193
Genetic experiment tests

509
00:56:12,524 --> 00:56:15,197
all failed.

510
00:56:18,084 --> 00:56:20,598
Intruder alert!
Block 4.6.4.

511
00:56:21,004 --> 00:56:21,959
Intruder alert!

512
00:56:22,484 --> 00:56:23,758
Maximum alert!

513
00:56:24,164 --> 00:56:25,483
We're terminating the tests.

514
00:56:25,764 --> 00:56:27,117
Bislane, get out of here!

515
00:56:28,124 --> 00:56:29,318
Authorizations

516
00:56:29,644 --> 00:56:31,077
have been rejected.

517
00:56:31,844 --> 00:56:35,200
All files relating to our research

518
00:56:35,524 --> 00:56:36,957
have been destroyed

519
00:56:37,284 --> 00:56:38,512
by Dr Muller.

520
00:56:39,284 --> 00:56:41,354
We lost 9 children.

521
00:56:42,884 --> 00:56:45,762
7 of them had mutated
before dying.

522
00:56:46,364 --> 00:56:47,433
They're here!

523
00:56:47,764 --> 00:56:48,514
Move away!

524
00:56:53,724 --> 00:56:56,238
They were all suffering
of heart condition,

525
00:56:56,564 --> 00:56:57,394
pulmonary troubles

526
00:56:57,684 --> 00:56:58,833
and brain damage.

527
00:57:06,124 --> 00:57:06,840
Code black!

528
00:57:09,644 --> 00:57:12,033
I repeat: switch to code black.

529
00:57:13,124 --> 00:57:16,958
Stay put during the
duration of the alert.

530
00:57:22,724 --> 00:57:24,157
They shut down everything!

531
00:57:24,964 --> 00:57:28,320
Stay put during the
duration of the alert.

532
00:57:32,124 --> 00:57:33,762
I can't see anything!

533
00:57:36,204 --> 00:57:37,159
Karas!

534
00:57:47,844 --> 00:57:48,993
Karas!

535
00:57:54,524 --> 00:57:56,162
What is it? Who's there?

536
00:58:07,244 --> 00:58:07,960
Ah!

537
00:58:08,204 --> 00:58:11,560
- It's me, quiet!
- They killed the children!

538
00:58:11,804 --> 00:58:15,353
- I heard, calm down.
We're gonna get out of here.

539
00:58:29,324 --> 00:58:32,077
Find them and don't lose them,

540
00:58:32,404 --> 00:58:33,473
understood?

541
00:58:36,204 --> 00:58:38,877
Try to get rid of the girl.

542
00:59:31,204 --> 00:59:33,240
We'll leave at dawn.

543
00:59:40,084 --> 00:59:41,517
We should sleep.

544
01:00:06,524 --> 01:00:08,480
I grew up in the Casbah.

545
01:00:14,204 --> 01:00:17,276
Do you think I've always been a cop?

546
01:00:32,644 --> 01:00:35,238
I have no other choice
than to trust you.

547
01:00:37,764 --> 01:00:42,076
But if you're still hiding something.

548
01:01:13,324 --> 01:01:14,279
Stop!

549
01:01:22,964 --> 01:01:24,556
You're crazy!

550
01:01:28,524 --> 01:01:30,480
I'm not afraid of you.

551
01:01:32,564 --> 01:01:34,395
You're the one afraid

552
01:01:34,724 --> 01:01:35,839
to reveal yourself.

553
01:01:48,444 --> 01:01:50,435
No one is born as a gangster.

554
01:01:50,964 --> 01:01:52,602
You become one,
that's all.

555
01:01:54,084 --> 01:01:58,157
Me, Farfella...
We still were kids.

556
01:01:59,484 --> 01:02:01,600
It was a game for us.

557
01:02:05,924 --> 01:02:06,879
One night...

558
01:02:08,804 --> 01:02:11,557
We were carrying money for someone.

559
01:02:13,764 --> 01:02:15,914
A rival gang trapped us,

560
01:02:18,084 --> 01:02:19,403
they lock us up,

561
01:02:20,764 --> 01:02:21,719
and beat the hell out of us.

562
01:02:31,164 --> 01:02:32,119
Run!

563
01:02:32,444 --> 01:02:33,320
Run!

564
01:02:33,604 --> 01:02:34,673
Run!

565
01:02:38,684 --> 01:02:40,595
Farfella managed to escape.

566
01:02:52,604 --> 01:02:55,164
So, under what charge
do we arrest her?

567
01:02:56,404 --> 01:02:59,635
What the hell is this?
I don't have any other choice.

568
01:02:59,964 --> 01:03:01,397
To protect you.

569
01:03:01,724 --> 01:03:04,557
Having sex with me doesn't
give you any right!

570
01:03:06,804 --> 01:03:07,839
Where is Amiel?

571
01:03:08,164 --> 01:03:11,236
He got a boy,
the funny thing is...

572
01:03:11,564 --> 01:03:12,474
What?

573
01:03:12,964 --> 01:03:14,682
He wanted to call him Karas.

574
01:03:14,964 --> 01:03:17,080
But he got worried it might

575
01:03:17,404 --> 01:03:18,803
bring him bad luck.

576
01:03:25,084 --> 01:03:26,676
Anything on Nakata?

577
01:03:27,884 --> 01:03:29,476
What would you do without me?

578
01:03:33,444 --> 01:03:34,354
Of course,

579
01:03:34,644 --> 01:03:38,478
I didn't tell you anything.
He was Muller's assistant until 2006.

580
01:03:38,764 --> 01:03:41,198
He's the only survivor of the team.

581
01:03:41,484 --> 01:03:43,714
A 93 years old young man.

582
01:04:03,284 --> 01:04:05,798
You came to talk about

583
01:04:06,124 --> 01:04:08,274
Jonas Muller, didn't you?

584
01:04:29,604 --> 01:04:31,834
I don't care about your opinion.

585
01:04:32,164 --> 01:04:35,042
I'm not ashamed of what I did.

586
01:04:36,324 --> 01:04:39,555
You killed all these children.

587
01:04:39,844 --> 01:04:42,642
We did everything we could to save them.

588
01:04:43,804 --> 01:04:45,317
They had progeria.

589
01:04:46,124 --> 01:04:48,513
Nobody killed them, nobody.

590
01:04:48,924 --> 01:04:51,438
These children were doomed.

591
01:04:52,124 --> 01:04:54,592
We tried everything to save them.

592
01:04:57,244 --> 01:05:01,874
Muller couldn't bear it
when his brother died.

593
01:05:03,084 --> 01:05:05,075
He gave up his research,

594
01:05:06,124 --> 01:05:09,673
and destroyed all his work
without hesitating.

595
01:05:11,284 --> 01:05:14,481
20 years of work gone in smoke.

596
01:05:17,924 --> 01:05:21,394
The clinic was his redemption.

597
01:05:25,564 --> 01:05:28,761
Ilona was the only one
to understand him.

598
01:05:30,284 --> 01:05:32,354
How do you know Ilona?

599
01:05:48,764 --> 01:05:53,121
She came here for the first time
about a year ago.

600
01:05:54,284 --> 01:05:59,233
She really wanted to
understand Dr Muller's past.

601
01:06:01,724 --> 01:06:05,399
She wanted to understand
the reason of our failure.

602
01:06:07,524 --> 01:06:09,401
What did Avalon do?

603
01:06:09,684 --> 01:06:12,881
They tried everything they could to
convince Muller to keep working.

604
01:06:13,924 --> 01:06:16,358
They offered him a fortune.

605
01:06:19,684 --> 01:06:21,197
Captain...

606
01:06:21,924 --> 01:06:25,519
Do you have the slightest idea

607
01:06:25,804 --> 01:06:28,477
of what Muller's protocole was?

608
01:06:30,804 --> 01:06:34,797
Progeria was just a step,
not a final goal.

609
01:06:37,164 --> 01:06:39,883
Our protocole wasn't complicated.

610
01:06:40,204 --> 01:06:42,320
It was even very simple.

611
01:06:44,164 --> 01:06:45,313
Our goal

612
01:06:45,884 --> 01:06:48,273
was immortality!

613
01:06:57,964 --> 01:06:59,317
Ah, ah! Oh...

614
01:07:11,484 --> 01:07:12,803
What time is it?

615
01:07:18,084 --> 01:07:19,642
- Immortality!

616
01:07:32,164 --> 01:07:34,598
Some results must remain secret.

617
01:07:34,924 --> 01:07:38,314
Really? Why, Jonas?
It's too dangerous.

618
01:07:38,604 --> 01:07:39,593
You're scared.

619
01:07:41,724 --> 01:07:42,839
Go ahead, shoot!

620
01:07:44,804 --> 01:07:46,237
Be done with it and shoot.

621
01:07:57,444 --> 01:08:00,436
When I think I've been
admiring you for all these years!

622
01:08:08,524 --> 01:08:11,277
Do you want me to tell
you what you are?

623
01:08:12,564 --> 01:08:14,998
A coward,
that's what you are.

624
01:09:00,324 --> 01:09:01,040
Don't move!

625
01:09:07,564 --> 01:09:08,963
Where is she, doctor?

626
01:09:11,764 --> 01:09:12,879
Your gun!

627
01:09:13,524 --> 01:09:14,673
Your e-call!

628
01:09:16,124 --> 01:09:17,079
Call some back up.

629
01:09:18,684 --> 01:09:19,434
Karas!

630
01:09:20,164 --> 01:09:22,803
What are you gonna do?
Shoot me?

631
01:09:23,604 --> 01:09:24,673
On your side!

632
01:09:28,124 --> 01:09:30,080
Tie yourself to the guardrail.

633
01:09:39,724 --> 01:09:41,840
She's alive, isn't she?

634
01:09:42,164 --> 01:09:45,600
Yes, unfortunately.
I'm not a murderer.

635
01:09:46,244 --> 01:09:48,360
I couldn't convince her.

636
01:09:48,644 --> 01:09:49,599
I tried to

637
01:09:49,884 --> 01:09:52,557
warn her about those people.

638
01:09:52,884 --> 01:09:55,034
Tell me where she is doctor.

639
01:09:55,324 --> 01:09:56,552
I hear you.

640
01:09:56,884 --> 01:09:57,999
And I understand.

641
01:09:58,364 --> 01:09:59,683
It wasn't easy.

642
01:10:00,004 --> 01:10:03,076
You don't know anything.
You're completely wrong

643
01:10:03,444 --> 01:10:04,923
since the beginning.

644
01:10:05,324 --> 01:10:07,884
Ilona is the danger!

645
01:10:08,604 --> 01:10:10,196
What are you talking about?

646
01:10:10,524 --> 01:10:12,321
Just like me,
40 years ago.

647
01:10:12,604 --> 01:10:16,438
She found the answer,
she discovered the secret.

648
01:10:16,924 --> 01:10:19,313
The protocol of immortality!

649
01:10:20,284 --> 01:10:21,797
And Avalon knows it.

650
01:10:32,924 --> 01:10:35,154
I know that you want to save her.

651
01:10:35,444 --> 01:10:39,403
But then you'll give Avalon
unlimited power.

652
01:10:39,684 --> 01:10:43,040
The power of life and death
will belong to them forever.

653
01:10:44,204 --> 01:10:44,920
No!

654
01:10:46,044 --> 01:10:47,796
We're running out of time.

655
01:10:48,844 --> 01:10:51,995
I've been hiding my discovery
from Avalon for 40 years

656
01:10:52,324 --> 01:10:54,519
to save us from hell.

657
01:10:55,404 --> 01:10:57,872
Without death, life has no meaning.

658
01:10:58,204 --> 01:10:59,683
Where is Ilona?

659
01:11:01,324 --> 01:11:02,518
You're not listening.

660
01:11:02,844 --> 01:11:05,677
Ilona isn't just another victim.

661
01:11:05,964 --> 01:11:07,317
If Avalon finds her

662
01:11:07,644 --> 01:11:09,714
we'll all become victims.

663
01:11:17,604 --> 01:11:19,515
No, don't do that!

664
01:11:21,844 --> 01:11:24,233
You're our last hope.

665
01:11:30,604 --> 01:11:32,196
Life is so beautiful,

666
01:11:33,004 --> 01:11:34,835
death will be sweet.

667
01:11:35,404 --> 01:11:37,201
In peace, I'm reborn.

668
01:11:41,404 --> 01:11:42,154
Noooo!

669
01:12:47,164 --> 01:12:48,677
What did he tell you?

670
01:12:49,004 --> 01:12:50,596
What you really are.

671
01:12:50,924 --> 01:12:53,233
Lecturing people

672
01:12:53,564 --> 01:12:56,715
isn't my strong point
but I'm infallible

673
01:12:57,044 --> 01:12:59,194
to smell sons of bitches.

674
01:12:59,884 --> 01:13:04,002
Despite this talent, a lot of
people die during your investigations.

675
01:13:04,764 --> 01:13:06,083
Dimitri Ostrovski.

676
01:13:08,044 --> 01:13:09,193
Jonas Muller.

677
01:13:11,324 --> 01:13:12,723
Hishiro Nakata.

678
01:13:15,244 --> 01:13:16,313
Don't you know it?

679
01:13:47,724 --> 01:13:49,555
Everything has a price, captain.

680
01:13:50,764 --> 01:13:53,324
The one we earn
or the one we pay.

681
01:13:56,404 --> 01:13:59,282
I'll make sure that
yours is high.

682
01:14:03,564 --> 01:14:04,963
I'll break you.

683
01:14:29,724 --> 01:14:31,919
I originally came 
to smash you to bits.

684
01:14:32,444 --> 01:14:34,480
Now I only have to pick them up.

685
01:15:37,364 --> 01:15:40,242
Dr Muller death remain a mystery.

686
01:15:40,484 --> 01:15:42,202
Reserved, he dedicated 

687
01:15:42,524 --> 01:15:44,037
his life to the poor.

688
01:15:44,364 --> 01:15:47,117
It's a irretrievable loss...

689
01:15:48,284 --> 01:15:49,034
He fell off

690
01:15:49,324 --> 01:15:50,882
the roof of officer

691
01:15:51,204 --> 01:15:52,159
Karas house.

692
01:15:52,444 --> 01:15:54,082
It may be a suicide.

693
01:15:54,404 --> 01:15:57,362
Captain Karas,
recently suspended,

694
01:15:57,684 --> 01:16:00,198
remains at police disposal.

695
01:16:03,164 --> 01:16:05,632
People disappear around me.

696
01:16:07,364 --> 01:16:09,434
At least we have something in common.

697
01:16:10,484 --> 01:16:12,554
You're not safe with me.

698
01:16:15,364 --> 01:16:16,717
We're gonna make it.

699
01:16:19,444 --> 01:16:22,277
It's just another little scar.

700
01:16:34,804 --> 01:16:35,793
What's going on?

701
01:16:37,204 --> 01:16:38,034
Karas?

702
01:16:41,084 --> 01:16:42,153
The scar!

703
01:16:42,724 --> 01:16:44,999
It's Claus,
Muller's brother.

704
01:16:45,284 --> 01:16:46,239
Oh, my god.

705
01:16:48,484 --> 01:16:49,633
He's alive.

706
01:16:56,604 --> 01:17:00,040
Muller had found
the secret of immortality.

707
01:17:00,284 --> 01:17:01,876
To protect him from Avalon,

708
01:17:02,124 --> 01:17:04,763
he destroyed all his work.

709
01:17:05,204 --> 01:17:06,478
Except one important thing:

710
01:17:06,804 --> 01:17:09,477
Claus himself.

711
01:17:13,844 --> 01:17:16,517
He stole the identity
of dead patients

712
01:17:16,804 --> 01:17:21,036
To allow Claus to live
anonymously for 40 years.

713
01:17:21,324 --> 01:17:22,916
He condemned him to live

714
01:17:23,164 --> 01:17:25,997
trapped in the body of a sick child.

715
01:17:27,444 --> 01:17:30,083
But Ilona discovered his secret.

716
01:17:31,444 --> 01:17:34,356
If Dellenbach finds
llona before me

717
01:17:35,124 --> 01:17:38,799
everything Muller did would
have been useless.

718
01:17:44,924 --> 01:17:46,801
You're not gonna abandon her?

719
01:17:47,084 --> 01:17:48,517
I'll find her.

720
01:17:49,524 --> 01:17:52,197
But she'll have to forget
her previous life.

721
01:17:54,924 --> 01:17:56,915
Promise me to save her.

722
01:17:59,644 --> 01:18:00,793
Promise me.

723
01:18:02,084 --> 01:18:03,517
I promise.

724
01:18:06,764 --> 01:18:08,880
You must hide.

725
01:18:09,284 --> 01:18:12,117
Dellenbach will do anything
to hurt us.

726
01:18:27,964 --> 01:18:29,033
Hmmm, hmmm.

727
01:18:35,244 --> 01:18:37,075
Come back to me safely
or I'll kill you.

728
01:18:38,724 --> 01:18:39,873
After 20 years...

729
01:18:42,124 --> 01:18:43,921
We're finally even.

730
01:18:45,964 --> 01:18:47,477
May the Prophet

731
01:18:47,804 --> 01:18:49,237
be with you, Karas.

732
01:18:50,564 --> 01:18:51,883
Salam aleikum.

733
01:19:15,764 --> 01:19:17,402
I loved him too.

734
01:19:18,084 --> 01:19:19,039
Claus?

735
01:19:22,004 --> 01:19:23,801
I know what you went through.

736
01:19:26,284 --> 01:19:28,275
I grew up alone too.

737
01:19:29,164 --> 01:19:31,917
Jonas took care of me
when I arrived.

738
01:19:34,004 --> 01:19:35,562
He gave me back hope.

739
01:19:37,764 --> 01:19:39,675
He was like a father to me.

740
01:19:40,484 --> 01:19:42,236
I need you, Claus.

741
01:20:16,644 --> 01:20:18,555
Everybody is looking for you.

742
01:20:20,684 --> 01:20:23,676
The video from the subway
security cameras

743
01:20:23,924 --> 01:20:26,119
near Muller's palce.
Carry on.

744
01:20:27,524 --> 01:20:30,800
Our friend gave us
his nicest smile.

745
01:20:31,084 --> 01:20:32,039
Look.

746
01:20:39,284 --> 01:20:40,478
One more time.

747
01:20:43,764 --> 01:20:44,719
Closer.

748
01:20:46,924 --> 01:20:47,800
Stay on him.

749
01:20:52,524 --> 01:20:53,240
Closer.

750
01:20:54,684 --> 01:20:55,434
Stop!

751
01:20:59,284 --> 01:21:00,399
We got him.

752
01:21:01,764 --> 01:21:02,958
Here's his hideout.

753
01:21:06,364 --> 01:21:07,274
Let's go.

754
01:21:07,764 --> 01:21:09,356
I'd rather go alone.

755
01:21:09,644 --> 01:21:11,555
I can't tell you why.

756
01:21:12,324 --> 01:21:14,042
Go back to your family.

757
01:21:15,644 --> 01:21:16,997
Wait, Karas!

758
01:21:23,124 --> 01:21:24,159
Good luck!

759
01:21:27,444 --> 01:21:28,843
Be careful.

760
01:21:45,564 --> 01:21:46,519
Karas!

761
01:22:04,324 --> 01:22:06,474
Where is your captain?

762
01:22:07,164 --> 01:22:10,918
I'm losing patience.
If you have better things to do...

763
01:22:18,964 --> 01:22:20,317
Hmmm...

764
01:22:21,204 --> 01:22:24,241
Your son weighted 3kg at birth.

765
01:22:26,284 --> 01:22:28,275
A beautiful child.

766
01:22:31,244 --> 01:22:33,314
Congratulations.

767
01:22:37,324 --> 01:22:40,839
It would be a shame if
anything bad happened to him.

768
01:22:42,764 --> 01:22:43,958
But rest assured.

769
01:22:44,244 --> 01:22:46,712
Avalon always took care of its children.

770
01:23:23,324 --> 01:23:25,758
It's only the 2 of us now.

771
01:24:50,764 --> 01:24:52,595
Ah!

772
01:25:05,644 --> 01:25:06,599
Claus, I...

773
01:25:52,444 --> 01:25:53,638
Ilona, let go of him!

774
01:25:54,564 --> 01:25:55,360
Let go of him!

775
01:26:03,044 --> 01:26:03,999
He tried to kill me.

776
01:26:16,964 --> 01:26:17,840
But I...

777
01:26:18,404 --> 01:26:19,473
Come with me.

778
01:26:19,804 --> 01:26:21,203
I know who you are.

779
01:26:21,724 --> 01:26:23,157
You killed Muller.

780
01:26:23,484 --> 01:26:24,963
IT's not true.
He was crazy.

781
01:26:25,204 --> 01:26:26,842
He wanted to protect you.

782
01:26:27,284 --> 01:26:28,683
I don't understand.

783
01:26:30,564 --> 01:26:31,679
What do you want?

784
01:26:32,684 --> 01:26:34,720
Let go of me!
But... no!

785
01:26:35,044 --> 01:26:37,478
I promised Bislane to save you.

786
01:26:37,804 --> 01:26:40,079
And I'll do it, that's it.

787
01:26:57,884 --> 01:26:58,919
Help!

788
01:27:00,764 --> 01:27:03,562
Another word and I'll kill you.

789
01:27:10,004 --> 01:27:11,323
Find them!

790
01:27:31,844 --> 01:27:32,799
Let go of me.

791
01:27:33,764 --> 01:27:34,833
Please!

792
01:28:12,844 --> 01:28:13,594
Ah!

793
01:28:25,084 --> 01:28:25,960
Come on.

794
01:28:44,804 --> 01:28:46,123
They're coming, Ilona.

795
01:28:47,444 --> 01:28:48,957
You must disappear.

796
01:28:50,924 --> 01:28:52,039
Forever.

797
01:28:54,164 --> 01:28:55,313
Hurry up.

798
01:28:55,884 --> 01:28:56,634
Come one!

799
01:28:58,244 --> 01:28:59,757
Pleae, I beg you.

800
01:29:00,444 --> 01:29:02,116
You are our only hope.

801
01:29:02,524 --> 01:29:04,116
Our only hope?

802
01:29:05,044 --> 01:29:05,874
Oh!

803
01:29:06,844 --> 01:29:08,516
Who do you think you are?

804
01:29:09,524 --> 01:29:12,675
The world is waiting
for my discovery.

805
01:29:13,244 --> 01:29:14,438
Since the dawn of mankind.

806
01:29:14,804 --> 01:29:18,114
Avalon will change your dreams
into nightmares.

807
01:29:18,564 --> 01:29:21,237
How can you know anything
about my dreams?

808
01:29:21,484 --> 01:29:22,234
Ilona!

809
01:29:22,524 --> 01:29:27,234
You wouldn't understand.
You're not fit for that.

810
01:29:27,644 --> 01:29:29,760
Bislane is safe.

811
01:29:30,364 --> 01:29:32,639
You can have a new life.

812
01:29:35,124 --> 01:29:37,240
I want eternal life.

813
01:29:37,484 --> 01:29:38,519
Ilona, no, no!

814
01:29:38,964 --> 01:29:40,158
Don't do that.

815
01:29:40,404 --> 01:29:41,883
Ilona, stop!

816
01:29:43,164 --> 01:29:45,678
Please, don't do that.

817
01:29:54,924 --> 01:29:58,712
Our goal was immortality.

818
01:29:59,004 --> 01:30:01,916
Without death, life has no meaning.

819
01:30:02,204 --> 01:30:04,001
Promise me to save her.

820
01:30:04,244 --> 01:30:07,395
- Ilona is the danger.
You don't understand.

821
01:30:07,644 --> 01:30:08,793
Promise me.

822
01:30:16,724 --> 01:30:17,440
Ah!

823
01:30:18,404 --> 01:30:19,598
Noooo!

824
01:31:01,004 --> 01:31:02,483
- Karas...

825
01:31:05,764 --> 01:31:07,117
Karas...

826
01:31:10,044 --> 01:31:11,193
Karas...

827
01:31:12,484 --> 01:31:14,998
I gave her a new identity.

828
01:31:17,284 --> 01:31:19,798
Ilona had already made a choice.

829
01:31:21,884 --> 01:31:23,158
She knew

830
01:31:23,404 --> 01:31:25,076
she had to give up.

831
01:31:27,924 --> 01:31:29,835
She left forever.

832
01:31:31,444 --> 01:31:33,400
She did for her own sake.

833
01:31:34,284 --> 01:31:35,956
For our own sake.

834
01:31:37,564 --> 01:31:39,680
I can't leave her alone.

835
01:31:41,564 --> 01:31:43,998
I can't abandon her.

836
01:31:46,364 --> 01:31:48,002
I must find her.

837
01:31:55,604 --> 01:31:57,799
No, you must respect her choice.

838
01:32:01,084 --> 01:32:03,120
You'll never see her again.

839
01:32:05,284 --> 01:32:06,956
But you can be proud.

840
01:32:07,884 --> 01:32:09,681
Proud of your little sister.

841
01:32:57,364 --> 01:32:59,514
I like to be beautiful everyday.

842
01:33:00,084 --> 01:33:01,756
I like to be in good shape.

843
01:33:02,644 --> 01:33:04,555
That's why I love Avalon.

844
01:33:05,084 --> 01:33:08,156
With Avalon,
I know that I am beautiful.

845
01:33:08,564 --> 01:33:10,839
And I know I'll remain that way.

846
01:33:11,604 --> 01:33:14,198
Avalon,
for a better world.

847
01:33:15,084 --> 01:33:16,153
Health...

848
01:33:16,644 --> 01:33:17,713
Beauty...

849
01:33:18,044 --> 01:33:19,363
Longevity...

850
01:33:20,124 --> 01:33:21,193
Avalon...

851
01:33:21,804 --> 01:33:25,479
We're on your side for life.
