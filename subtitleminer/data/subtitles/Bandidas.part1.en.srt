Please take notes.

2
00:01:11,921 --> 00:01:15,413
No wounds on the body to indicate
foul play from a weapon of any sort.

3
00:01:15,592 --> 00:01:20,188
<i>The contents of the safe are intact,</i>
<i>thus ruling out robbery as a motive.</i>

4
00:01:20,363 --> 00:01:22,558
<i>The science of fingerprinting</i>
<i>has determined...</i>

5
00:01:22,732 --> 00:01:25,758
<i>... there are no prints but the victim's</i>
<i>on the doorknob and frame...</i>

6
00:01:25,935 --> 00:01:28,028
<i>... to indicate anyone else</i>
<i>entered or left.</i>

7
00:01:28,204 --> 00:01:30,399
The window is latched shut
from the inside.

8
00:01:30,573 --> 00:01:32,507
<i>So no one entered or left by that route...</i>

9
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:34,939
<i>... thus ruling out homicide</i>
<i>as a cause of death.</i>

10
00:01:35,111 --> 00:01:38,877
There's no indication of whiskey in
the glass or on the breath of the deceased.

11
00:01:39,048 --> 00:01:41,073
No carpet fibers
on the soles of her shoes.

12
00:01:41,251 --> 00:01:44,880
<i>So she never set foot on the carpet.</i>
<i>There is a scuff on her right shoe tip...</i>

13
00:01:45,054 --> 00:01:46,351
<i>... where polish was removed.</i>

14
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:49,959
<i>There is traces of the same polish</i>
<i>on this upturned bit of carpet.</i>

15
00:01:50,126 --> 00:01:54,688
There are traces of flower pollen
on the edges of the nostril.

16
00:01:55,765 --> 00:01:59,326
I therefore conclude
from the evidence gathered...

17
00:01:59,769 --> 00:02:02,636
<i>... that the deceased entered the room</i>
<i>with a bunch of flowers.</i>

18
00:02:02,806 --> 00:02:05,036
<i>She placed the flowers</i>
<i>in the vase by the door.</i>

19
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:08,735
<i>She took the vase in one hand, along</i>
<i>with the whiskey tumbler in the other...</i>

20
00:02:08,912 --> 00:02:11,278
<i>... went across the room</i>
<i>to the decanter of whiskey...</i>

21
00:02:11,447 --> 00:02:13,438
<i>... let the flowers get too close</i>
<i>to her nose.</i>

22
00:02:13,616 --> 00:02:16,278
<i>She sneezed, her left foot</i>
<i>involuntarily slipped forward...</i>

23
00:02:16,452 --> 00:02:18,511
<i>... caught the tip of her shoe</i>
<i>on this carpet...</i>

24
00:02:18,688 --> 00:02:21,953
...tripped, hit her head on the floor,
died from shock of the brain.

25
00:02:22,125 --> 00:02:25,356
In other words, it was not foul play
that killed this poor woman...

26
00:02:25,528 --> 00:02:29,396
...but an accident
caused by a simple sneeze.

27
00:02:30,099 --> 00:02:32,659
And, in fact, it is not a woman at all...

28
00:02:32,836 --> 00:02:37,637
...but a man wearing a horse-haired wig.

29
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:58,590
Oh, Quentin, I'm so proud.

30
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:01,787
- You know what this means, Clarissa?
- Yes, that we can get married.

31
00:03:01,965 --> 00:03:04,263
It means science has a place
in police work.

32
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:09,800
I proved it. I convinced
each and every one of them.

33
00:03:09,973 --> 00:03:12,373
Now there's only one more person
you have to convince.

34
00:03:12,642 --> 00:03:15,577
I'm convinced.
But you must remember, Mr. Jackson...

35
00:03:15,745 --> 00:03:18,305
...if we don't own the land
within 90 days...

36
00:03:18,481 --> 00:03:22,611
...the railroad will go to other banks
to finance their expansion.

37
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:24,719
No worries, Mr. Ashe.

38
00:03:24,888 --> 00:03:28,654
In 90 days, we'll be laying track
right through the middle of Mexico City.

39
00:03:41,237 --> 00:03:42,636
Go.

40
00:03:43,373 --> 00:03:44,499
That's a good one.

41
00:03:48,544 --> 00:03:49,670
You do better.

42
00:03:49,846 --> 00:03:52,406
How could you sell the mortgage
on my farm to the gringos?

43
00:03:52,582 --> 00:03:55,176
Pedro, we have no choice.

44
00:03:55,351 --> 00:03:57,649
The big American banks
control the cash flow.

45
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,845
And through the cash flow,
they control us.

46
00:04:00,023 --> 00:04:01,320
Don Diego's doing all he can.

47
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:03,652
I'm sure Don Diego is.

48
00:04:03,826 --> 00:04:08,456
But I've worked my whole life
to leave something to my poor daughter.

49
00:04:08,631 --> 00:04:11,429
All she knows is the farm life.

50
00:04:11,801 --> 00:04:13,166
What will become of her?

51
00:04:26,449 --> 00:04:28,781
You cheated. I wasn't concentrating.

52
00:04:31,921 --> 00:04:33,320
Best of three.

53
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:45,959
- Let me talk to Bernardo.
- Bernardo just follows orders.

54
00:04:46,803 --> 00:04:50,466
So, what are we supposed to do, Papa,
stand by and let them steal our land?

55
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:54,406
Unless some higher authority
intercedes...

56
00:04:55,745 --> 00:04:57,406
Maria, where are you going?

57
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:58,911
To see the higher authority.

58
00:05:30,113 --> 00:05:32,104
Up. Up.

59
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:52,158
The spitting image of her mother,
God rest her soul.

60
00:05:52,335 --> 00:05:54,360
My condolences, Don Diego.

61
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:56,137
Twenty years she's gone now.

62
00:05:56,305 --> 00:05:58,398
Well, she left you
a very beautiful daughter.

63
00:05:58,574 --> 00:06:02,533
Who I haven't seen in most of the 10 years
she's been away at school in Europe.

64
00:06:03,179 --> 00:06:06,478
- Left a girl, came home a woman.
- Indeed.

65
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:10,609
My only problem now
is trying to convince her to stay.

66
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:13,551
She's been home for a week,
and already she wants to go back.

67
00:06:18,761 --> 00:06:21,059
- I want to see Don Diego.
- He can't be disturbed.

68
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:23,425
Neither can I. And I am.
Very disturbed.

69
00:06:23,599 --> 00:06:26,067
He is meeting
with a very important person.

70
00:06:26,235 --> 00:06:29,432
Don Diego has always said,
"Every client is a very important person."

71
00:06:29,605 --> 00:06:32,073
This is not a client, Maria.

72
00:06:32,241 --> 00:06:35,005
This is a gentleman
from The Bank of New York.

73
00:06:35,878 --> 00:06:37,743
I knew it.

74
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:43,546
Gotta pay the toll.

75
00:06:58,167 --> 00:07:01,500
May I present Mr. Jackson from
the Capital Bank and Trust of <i>Nueva York.</i>

76
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:02,933
How do you do, Mr. Jackson?

77
00:07:03,106 --> 00:07:07,167
Infinitely better in your presence
than I do out of it, Señorita Sandoval.

78
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:10,611
Afternoon tea. How civilized.

79
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:13,578
Are you surprised to find
that we are civilized, Mr. Jackson?

80
00:07:13,749 --> 00:07:15,341
No, not at all.

81
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:17,315
No, I find it charming.

82
00:07:17,487 --> 00:07:18,852
Charming?

83
00:07:19,088 --> 00:07:20,919
I presume if you are using
such a word...

84
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:25,049
...that you've never experienced
the pleasure of an afternoon tea.

85
00:07:25,228 --> 00:07:28,095
Mr. Jackson's bank has agreed
to provide us...

86
00:07:28,264 --> 00:07:31,165
...with the capital we need
to continue with what we are doing.

87
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,834
We were just going over the papers.

88
00:07:35,171 --> 00:07:39,665
A big New York bank taking an interest
in our small Mexican bank?

89
00:07:40,009 --> 00:07:42,000
Why is that, Mr. Jackson?

90
00:07:42,178 --> 00:07:45,614
Well, if you can't help friends
in a time of need, who can you help?

91
00:07:46,082 --> 00:07:48,812
Pardon me, but in Europe
we have a different perspective...

92
00:07:48,985 --> 00:07:51,146
...on the American definition
of friendship.

93
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:54,221
Forgive my ignorance, señorita,
but I'm a little uninformed...

94
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:56,153
...on the European perspective.

95
00:07:56,325 --> 00:08:00,022
But I'm always willing to learn.
In fact, I'd be delighted...

96
00:08:00,196 --> 00:08:03,222
...if you would enlighten me
on that subject, perhaps over dinner?

97
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:05,526
Perhaps some other time.
I need to get up early.

98
00:08:05,701 --> 00:08:06,929
I have a long ride tomorrow.

99
00:08:07,103 --> 00:08:08,502
Checkmate.

100
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:16,139
Goodbye, Mr. Jackson.

101
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:19,772
Men. All they have is one thing
on their minds.

102
00:08:19,949 --> 00:08:22,076
And, by the way, that includes you.

103
00:08:22,518 --> 00:08:26,113
Please. I've seen how you look
at that little filly of Señor Gomez.

104
00:08:26,289 --> 00:08:27,756
A little more.

105
00:08:28,024 --> 00:08:29,719
A little more.

106
00:08:45,808 --> 00:08:47,105
Stay here.

107
00:08:49,412 --> 00:08:51,607
Don't talk to anybody.

108
00:09:18,774 --> 00:09:19,866
Excuse me.

109
00:09:20,042 --> 00:09:21,805
Excuse me.

110
00:09:22,511 --> 00:09:24,308
What was that?
Is there a problem?

111
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:25,909
For me? No.

112
00:09:26,082 --> 00:09:28,050
For the horse
that gets poked in the side...

113
00:09:28,217 --> 00:09:30,708
...with metal every time
you want him to do something...

114
00:09:30,886 --> 00:09:32,854
...for him, I'm sure it's a problem.

115
00:09:33,723 --> 00:09:36,157
Of course, he's probably
too polite to say anything.

116
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:38,691
Well, certainly more polite than you.

117
00:09:38,861 --> 00:09:42,058
But, anyway, thank you for your opinion,
misinformed as it is.

118
00:09:42,231 --> 00:09:44,631
Perhaps you can tell me
what you're doing in my house.

119
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,028
Oh, so you are the daughter.

120
00:09:46,202 --> 00:09:49,262
- Yes, I am the daughter. And you are?
- Maria Alvarez.

121
00:09:49,438 --> 00:09:52,839
- Do you work for us, Maria Alvarez?
- No, I do not work for you.

122
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:55,944
- Then what are you doing here?
- I have business with your father.

123
00:09:58,481 --> 00:10:01,712
- And what sort of business, may I ask?
- Private business.

124
00:10:02,285 --> 00:10:03,274
Hey.

125
00:10:04,587 --> 00:10:06,555
Hey, stop. Hey.

126
00:10:07,657 --> 00:10:09,056
Maria.

127
00:10:09,225 --> 00:10:10,783
Maria.

128
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:24,100
I knew it.

129
00:10:24,273 --> 00:10:27,902
You help the gringos steal our land.
You betray your own people.

130
00:10:28,411 --> 00:10:29,810
How dare you accuse me.

131
00:10:29,979 --> 00:10:31,742
Get her out of here.
Have her arrested.

132
00:10:31,914 --> 00:10:35,281
Traitor. Thief.
You're gonna pay for this.

133
00:10:36,152 --> 00:10:37,141
I'm sorry.

134
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,550
They are stealing our land.

135
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:41,383
Don Diego is a traitor.

136
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:45,220
Don Diego is a traitor.

137
00:10:48,964 --> 00:10:51,558
- The future.
- To the future.

138
00:11:06,282 --> 00:11:07,271
Are you lost?

139
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:09,174
Mr. Alvarez, Pedro...

140
00:11:09,352 --> 00:11:12,185
...you're delinquent
in your loan payments.

141
00:11:12,355 --> 00:11:15,916
How can I pay when the interest
is more than I earn?

142
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:18,526
Says in this agreement
that if you're in arrears...

143
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:23,297
...we have the right to foreclose
and purchase this property for one peso.

144
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:29,335
Over my dead body.

145
00:11:29,505 --> 00:11:30,767
No problem.

146
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:41,341
There's your receipt, Mr. Alvarez, Pedro.

147
00:11:42,017 --> 00:11:43,507
Burn it.

148
00:11:55,398 --> 00:11:57,730
You should have locked them up,
not me.

149
00:11:58,467 --> 00:12:02,028
- They did not break into someone's house.
- No, they are doing worse.

150
00:12:02,204 --> 00:12:05,401
You want my advice, Maria?
You should stop trying to change the world.

151
00:12:05,574 --> 00:12:10,477
You want my advice, Gustavo?
You should start trying to change the world.

152
00:12:12,882 --> 00:12:14,179
Eat.

153
00:12:20,556 --> 00:12:23,252
The poultice that will help
your horse's hoof.

154
00:12:24,527 --> 00:12:25,755
Thank you.

155
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:30,392
Now who's gonna be outside?

156
00:12:33,369 --> 00:12:34,893
Keep an eye on her.

157
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:41,840
- What are you doing here?
- Hey, old man, read this.

158
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:44,172
- What's this?
- This is for you.

159
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:46,712
You haven't been making
your payments to the bank.

160
00:12:46,882 --> 00:12:48,679
We have a right to foreclose.

161
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:52,617
I've given you everything you're gonna
get from me. Now get out.

162
00:13:32,027 --> 00:13:34,962
Papa? Papa?

163
00:13:36,098 --> 00:13:37,725
Papa.

164
00:13:40,436 --> 00:13:41,733
Maria.

165
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:02,986
Papa. Papa?

166
00:14:03,225 --> 00:14:04,385
Papa?

167
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,427
Somebody, please go get a doctor.

168
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:10,292
- What did you do to him?
- I didn't do anything.

169
00:14:10,466 --> 00:14:13,902
- We were finishing the arrangements...
- You killed him.

170
00:14:14,069 --> 00:14:15,661
You killed my father.

171
00:14:15,838 --> 00:14:18,136
Señorita,
he's evidently had a heart attack.

172
00:14:18,307 --> 00:14:19,638
No.

173
00:14:19,808 --> 00:14:21,036
He was...

174
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:23,178
He was healthy.

175
00:14:23,345 --> 00:14:26,143
You did something to him.
I know you did.

176
00:14:26,348 --> 00:14:31,547
I know this is a terrible shock for you,
but you need to try and remain calm.

177
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,688
In fact, I think you need to sit down.

178
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:36,787
Grief is intense, I understand that.

179
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,792
But if you can,
let's review the situation calmly.

180
00:14:40,362 --> 00:14:43,263
Your father's dead. Everything that
belonged to him is now mine.

181
00:14:43,432 --> 00:14:46,230
In your mistaken belief
that I had something to do with it...

182
00:14:46,402 --> 00:14:48,529
...you've attacked me.
You're trying to kill me.

183
00:14:49,104 --> 00:14:51,299
My natural reaction is self-defense.

184
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:53,634
Before we can stop this,
I'll shoot you dead.

185
00:14:54,209 --> 00:14:56,643
But it doesn't have to end that way.

186
00:14:59,448 --> 00:15:00,972
Look at that, darling.

187
00:15:02,017 --> 00:15:03,882
It's choosing time.

188
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:14,990
That's it.

189
00:15:19,635 --> 00:15:21,899
Well, I guess we've got a deal.

190
00:15:23,072 --> 00:15:26,405
If you don't mind,
I need to go to my room.

191
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:28,833
I must lie down.

192
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:32,674
This is all too much for me at once.
You understand?

193
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:35,974
Yes.

194
00:15:36,151 --> 00:15:38,278
Absolutely.

195
00:15:38,454 --> 00:15:40,149
I understand.

196
00:15:43,092 --> 00:15:44,889
You take all the time you need.

197
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:51,591
Don't worry about a thing.

198
00:15:52,468 --> 00:15:54,527
I'll make all the arrangements.

199
00:16:05,147 --> 00:16:06,705
Oh, darling?

200
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:11,050
Would you like your afternoon tea...

201
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,484
...sent up to your room?

202
00:16:16,258 --> 00:16:18,988
That would be very nice. Thank you.

203
00:16:39,982 --> 00:16:41,973
- Hey. Hey.
- Get back here.

204
00:16:42,151 --> 00:16:43,675
Come back here, you bitch.

205
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:46,721
- Come back.
- Hey. Come here.

206
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:54,255
I got you now.

207
00:17:30,032 --> 00:17:31,829
Goddamn it.

208
00:17:54,556 --> 00:17:56,820
- Padre.
- Maria?

209
00:17:59,094 --> 00:18:00,493
They shot him.

210
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:04,063
I know, my child. I know.

211
00:18:25,454 --> 00:18:27,479
What do you want from me, huh?

212
00:18:27,656 --> 00:18:30,022
I have nothing to give you. Nothing.

213
00:18:30,959 --> 00:18:33,826
You should have eaten
while you had the chance.

214
00:19:16,772 --> 00:19:18,467
Get out of here. Shoo.

215
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:46,325
Hands up.

216
00:19:46,501 --> 00:19:47,763
No one...

217
00:19:48,237 --> 00:19:49,534
Move.

218
00:19:58,046 --> 00:19:59,911
What are you doing?

219
00:20:00,749 --> 00:20:03,775
What do you think I'm doing?
I'm taking this bank.

220
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:06,811
- With an unloaded gun?
- How do you know?

221
00:20:07,022 --> 00:20:08,853
When a gun doesn't have any bullets...

222
00:20:09,024 --> 00:20:11,959
Doesn't matter.
This bank is taken. Find another one.

223
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:14,925
This is the only bank in town.
Besides, it's my father's.

224
00:20:15,097 --> 00:20:16,826
And take that raggedy mask off.

225
00:20:16,999 --> 00:20:19,433
It doesn't even match.
Everyone knows who you are.

226
00:20:19,601 --> 00:20:22,126
Your mask isn't silly?
People won't recognize that voice?

227
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:24,602
- "This is my father's bank."
- It is my father's.

228
00:20:24,773 --> 00:20:26,638
Get out of my way.
I need to finish my job.

229
00:20:26,808 --> 00:20:30,209
- Señoritas?
- I would hardly call stealing a job.

230
00:20:30,412 --> 00:20:32,539
Señoritas?

231
00:20:32,714 --> 00:20:34,511
I am not stealing.

232
00:20:34,683 --> 00:20:37,413
I am taking it back from the bastards
who murdered my father.

233
00:20:37,853 --> 00:20:39,878
- They killed Don Diego?
- Señoritas.

234
00:20:40,055 --> 00:20:41,488
What?

235
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:44,387
The first order of business
is that we're gonna secure...

236
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:46,424
...and then remove all the deposits.

237
00:20:46,595 --> 00:20:49,223
And then we're gonna instill
some renewed confidence in it.

238
00:20:49,398 --> 00:20:52,196
I'd like to see the Stars and Stripes
flying over this place...

239
00:20:52,367 --> 00:20:55,495
...so things start to look
a little more American down here.

240
00:20:58,273 --> 00:21:00,138
Señor Manager?

241
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:03,409
This establishment is now
a wholly-owned subsidiary...

242
00:21:03,578 --> 00:21:06,138
...of the Capital Bank and Trust
of New York.

243
00:21:06,481 --> 00:21:08,005
What do you say we open the vault?

244
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:12,750
Take a look, and see what kind of cash
is on hand in the liquid-assets department.

245
00:21:14,089 --> 00:21:16,182
Excuse me. Where is the vault?

246
00:21:17,793 --> 00:21:19,055
In Don Diego's office.

247
00:21:19,227 --> 00:21:23,163
Well, I guess that would be Señor Jackson's
office now, wouldn't it?

248
00:21:36,178 --> 00:21:37,770
<i>We did it. We did it.</i>

249
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,275
We did it. We did it.

250
00:21:43,785 --> 00:21:46,219
- We did it.
- And what is it that you think you did?

251
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:48,720
Look. We're gonna help a lot of people.

252
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:49,982
To really help...

253
00:21:50,158 --> 00:21:53,559
...you'd have to reverse the massive theft
of property that has taken place.

254
00:21:53,962 --> 00:21:57,898
Listen, do you know how many
kilos of rice we can buy with this?

255
00:21:58,066 --> 00:22:00,591
We can feed 500 people.

256
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:05,471
Why were you robbing the bank?

257
00:22:06,108 --> 00:22:07,336
Revenge.

258
00:22:07,509 --> 00:22:09,238
Not to help the people?

259
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:11,106
No.

260
00:22:16,251 --> 00:22:17,479
What?

261
00:22:19,521 --> 00:22:21,614
Stop looking at me that way,
both of you.

262
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:23,587
My life is not here.

263
00:22:24,459 --> 00:22:26,450
- What are you doing?
- What does it look like?

264
00:22:26,628 --> 00:22:29,961
Taking the money.
I'm going back to Europe.

265
00:22:30,132 --> 00:22:31,463
You're joking.

266
00:22:31,633 --> 00:22:33,726
All right, you can take half. I don't care.

267
00:22:33,902 --> 00:22:35,927
You can even keep the dog as a bonus.

268
00:22:38,807 --> 00:22:40,434
If you want to go, go.

269
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:42,668
But the money stays. All of it.

270
00:22:42,844 --> 00:22:44,641
- No, it doesn't.
- Yes, it does.

271
00:22:44,813 --> 00:22:46,440
No, it doesn't.

272
00:23:58,753 --> 00:24:02,849
We were just debating
the basic economic theories...

273
00:24:03,024 --> 00:24:05,185
...of wealth distribution.

274
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,692
Yes. Yes, we were.

275
00:24:07,996 --> 00:24:09,588
That's good.

276
00:24:09,764 --> 00:24:12,733
But before you reach
any hasty conclusions...

277
00:24:12,901 --> 00:24:14,596
...let me show you something.

278
00:25:07,355 --> 00:25:08,754
What?

279
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:11,415
Rice and beans
are not good enough for you?

280
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:15,029
I just can't eat when I see
what has been done to these people.

281
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:16,761
At least tonight they can eat.

282
00:25:19,501 --> 00:25:22,493
We have to find a way
to get them back on their land.

283
00:25:22,671 --> 00:25:24,468
We must come up with a plan.

284
00:25:24,639 --> 00:25:26,470
Something that will benefit the people...

285
00:25:26,641 --> 00:25:28,905
...and destroy these murderers.

286
00:25:31,446 --> 00:25:33,710
I think we should rob more banks.

287
00:25:33,882 --> 00:25:35,406
Yeah.

288
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:43,917
Let's go.

289
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:46,552
- Let's go where?
- Let's go rob more banks.

290
00:25:47,495 --> 00:25:50,862
We can't just go right now
and rob a bank.

291
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:52,964
Fine. Finish brushing.

292
00:25:53,401 --> 00:25:55,835
That's not it. We're not ready.

293
00:25:56,404 --> 00:25:58,463
- Yes, we are. We just did it.
- We were lucky.

294
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,837
We cannot rely on luck.
We need to think first.

295
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:06,071
We need to consider the implications,
the consequences.

296
00:26:06,581 --> 00:26:09,141
- Why are you so complicated?
- Why are you so unrealistic?

297
00:26:09,484 --> 00:26:14,820
This is a noble cause
you seek to undertake, señoritas.

298
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:19,552
But if you keep fighting like cats and dogs,
you won't make it to sunrise.

299
00:26:21,162 --> 00:26:24,495
My daughters, you know...

300
00:26:24,899 --> 00:26:28,892
...when Columbus proposed his journey
to discover the New World...

301
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:31,368
...everybody said that was...

302
00:26:31,539 --> 00:26:33,063
...unrealistic.

303
00:26:33,241 --> 00:26:34,674
But he succeeded.

304
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:38,040
Because he had the king and queen
of Spain to help him.

305
00:26:38,213 --> 00:26:40,704
Who do we have to help us?

306
00:26:40,982 --> 00:26:45,316
I think I might know someone
who can help you.

307
00:26:50,191 --> 00:26:51,658
Can I help you?

308
00:26:51,826 --> 00:26:53,293
We're looking for these two.

309
00:26:54,229 --> 00:26:57,255
What's a pair of señoritas like that
gonna be doing way out here?

310
00:26:57,432 --> 00:27:00,424
We found this snagged on a cactus
half mile down the road.

311
00:27:00,602 --> 00:27:04,038
Well, you find any more of that,
you can make yourself a nice little hankie.

312
00:27:04,973 --> 00:27:07,203
Now, do you mind getting your foot
out of my door?

313
00:27:07,676 --> 00:27:10,076
- And if I don't?
- Lf you don't, I'll kill you.

314
00:27:10,245 --> 00:27:12,236
Now get your sorry ass off this porch.

315
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:14,341
You too.

316
00:27:18,586 --> 00:27:19,883
Come on.

317
00:27:35,403 --> 00:27:37,496
Hey, does this belong to you?

318
00:27:37,672 --> 00:27:38,900
Thank you.

319
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:40,507
Excuse me.

320
00:27:40,775 --> 00:27:41,969
Mr...

321
00:27:44,546 --> 00:27:46,639
- Where are you going?
- Far from here.

322
00:27:46,815 --> 00:27:49,841
Toughs like that tend to come back
with reinforcements.

323
00:27:50,018 --> 00:27:52,851
- But you said you would help us.
- I just did, missy.

324
00:27:53,021 --> 00:27:55,819
No, no. Padre Pablo said
you could teach us to rob banks.

325
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:57,457
Well, where did he get that idea?

326
00:27:57,625 --> 00:27:59,183
He said that's what you used to do.

327
00:27:59,361 --> 00:28:02,262
That you robbed 37 banks in Texas
and never got caught.

328
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:05,331
Thirty-seven.
Last time I go to confession.

329
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:09,766
Listen, high-minded ideals is one thing,
robbing banks is another.

330
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:12,873
And to tell you the truth,
neither one of you pass the muster.

331
00:28:13,041 --> 00:28:16,841
- We're well aware of that. At least I am.
- That's why we came to you.

332
00:28:17,011 --> 00:28:18,342
To learn.

333
00:28:18,513 --> 00:28:20,344
Well, to learn, you gotta have resources.

334
00:28:20,515 --> 00:28:22,312
So far the only thing you've shown me...

335
00:28:22,484 --> 00:28:25,180
...is a talent for bringing trouble
to my front door.

336
00:28:25,353 --> 00:28:26,615
<i>Buena suerte,</i> ladies.

337
00:28:29,657 --> 00:28:31,716
Mr. Buck.

338
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:35,190
You're not going anywhere...

339
00:28:35,363 --> 00:28:37,854
...until you tell us
everything we need to know.

340
00:28:38,166 --> 00:28:40,157
First, if you pull the trigger
on that gun...

341
00:28:40,335 --> 00:28:42,735
...the way you're pointed,
you might cause it to rain.

342
00:28:42,904 --> 00:28:45,566
- Well, haven't you fired a pistol before?
- I have.

343
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:47,139
But you didn't kill anybody.

344
00:28:47,308 --> 00:28:48,570
There's always a first time.

345
00:28:48,743 --> 00:28:50,472
That's true. But this ain't it.

346
00:28:55,083 --> 00:28:56,744
Hey.

347
00:28:59,587 --> 00:29:01,316
What are you doing?

348
00:29:04,426 --> 00:29:06,155
Come on. Go on.

349
00:29:06,528 --> 00:29:08,587
What the heck? Go on.

350
00:29:18,773 --> 00:29:20,297
Git.

351
00:29:22,076 --> 00:29:23,475
Go, git.

352
00:29:24,345 --> 00:29:25,403
Come on.

353
00:29:34,222 --> 00:29:35,917
Hey, what have you done to this horse?

354
00:29:36,090 --> 00:29:39,423
- Please, Mr. Buck, they killed my father.
- And they almost killed mine.

355
00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:47,095
You're breaking my heart.

356
00:29:47,268 --> 00:29:51,500
All right, look, no whining, no complaining,
no fighting, or I'm <i>adiós</i>.

357
00:29:51,706 --> 00:29:52,934
I never whine.

358
00:29:53,107 --> 00:29:56,406
- Oh, please.
- "Oh, please." Well, I don't.

359
00:29:56,578 --> 00:29:59,069
- Don't. Don't hit.
- Don't hit me. Stop.

360
00:29:59,247 --> 00:30:00,646
- Don't hit me.
- Don't hit me.

361
00:30:00,815 --> 00:30:02,476
Ladies. Hey.

362
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:04,584
What's it gonna be?

363
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:09,921
- Deal.
- Deal.

364
00:30:13,828 --> 00:30:15,056
All right, you first.

365
00:30:22,871 --> 00:30:24,566
That's pretty good.

366
00:30:25,507 --> 00:30:27,839
- How many you got left?
- I don't know.

367
00:30:31,312 --> 00:30:32,677
You need to know.

368
00:30:32,847 --> 00:30:36,476
Many a man's been left to die
for want of an extra bullet.

369
00:30:36,651 --> 00:30:38,642
She's not very good with numbers.

370
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:40,481
Your turn.

371
00:30:50,465 --> 00:30:52,433
I can't do this.

372
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,465
When I get nervous, I get the hiccups.

373
00:30:54,969 --> 00:30:56,436
Guns make you nervous?

374
00:30:56,604 --> 00:30:58,595
What the hell are you gonna use
to rob banks?

375
00:30:58,773 --> 00:31:00,570
My education.

376
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:02,968
- "My education."
- What's so funny?

377
00:31:03,144 --> 00:31:05,339
- To rob banks. Rob a bank.
- "My education."

378
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:09,879
You wish you had one,
you ignorant crack-shot showoff.

379
00:31:10,051 --> 00:31:14,545
Fort Granger, Oklahoma, U.S. Cavalry.
That's my education.

380
00:31:16,724 --> 00:31:19,488
Hey. Hey. Hey.

381
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:22,525
No one moves.

382
00:31:23,364 --> 00:31:25,525
Get on the floor.

383
00:31:25,733 --> 00:31:29,430
How are they gonna get on the floor?
I told them not to move.

384
00:31:29,604 --> 00:31:31,071
Right.

385
00:31:31,239 --> 00:31:33,833
So get on the floor and no one move.

386
00:31:36,578 --> 00:31:39,274
Sara. Sara.

387
00:31:39,447 --> 00:31:41,347
- I have to tell you something.
- Hold on.

388
00:31:41,516 --> 00:31:44,417
Why are we doing this?
This has nothing to do with robbing banks.

389
00:31:44,586 --> 00:31:46,520
Robbing banks is easy.

390
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:48,519
It's getting away
that's the hard part.

391
00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:51,090
- Sara.
- How long do we have to stay like this?

392
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:54,091
- As long as it takes.
- Sara.

393
00:31:54,262 --> 00:31:55,593
What?

394
00:31:55,763 --> 00:31:57,822
I don't think I can hold any longer.

395
00:31:57,999 --> 00:32:00,490
So drop off and swim to the shore.

396
00:32:00,668 --> 00:32:02,499
I can't swim.

397
00:32:13,014 --> 00:32:14,743
Sara.

398
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:19,147
Sara.

399
00:32:34,168 --> 00:32:35,465
Hold on to the rock.

400
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:06,564
Thank you.

401
00:33:06,734 --> 00:33:08,361
- For what?
- For saving my life.

402
00:33:09,337 --> 00:33:11,498
You noticed this time.

403
00:33:12,106 --> 00:33:13,596
Good.

404
00:33:17,211 --> 00:33:18,940
- Sara.
- What?

405
00:33:19,347 --> 00:33:22,612
I guess...
I guess this makes us friends now.

406
00:33:23,818 --> 00:33:26,286
I don't know about friends.

407
00:33:26,988 --> 00:33:28,956
But partners...

408
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:34,960
Definitely partners.

409
00:33:44,572 --> 00:33:46,437
Single file.

410
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:49,501
You gotta aim. Aim the gun.

411
00:33:49,677 --> 00:33:51,110
Aim it.

412
00:33:51,379 --> 00:33:53,006
Go on, higher. Higher. Higher.

413
00:33:54,782 --> 00:33:56,113
Stinky, I'm sorry.

414
00:33:58,219 --> 00:34:00,779
Come on, go. Faster, faster.

415
00:34:18,873 --> 00:34:22,138
Before you kill your dog,
we need to try something.

416
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:25,108
Just take that.
See what you can do with those.

417
00:34:35,890 --> 00:34:37,517
See, I knew she had talent.

418
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:44,029
Two hundred and forty-four, 245, 246...

419
00:34:44,198 --> 00:34:47,861
...247, 248, 24...

420
00:35:47,628 --> 00:35:49,653
That's the expert?

421
00:35:55,636 --> 00:35:57,297
Mr. Cooke...

422
00:35:57,705 --> 00:35:59,935
...welcome to Mexico.

423
00:36:00,608 --> 00:36:02,906
Well, clearly, they're a pair of amateurs.

424
00:36:03,077 --> 00:36:05,545
Robbing a bank in less than a minute
with no casualties.

425
00:36:05,713 --> 00:36:08,614
I'd say they could pass as professionals.

426
00:36:11,385 --> 00:36:14,843
That's odd.
These land transfers they left behind.

427
00:36:15,022 --> 00:36:17,115
Who would sell a farm for one peso?

428
00:36:17,291 --> 00:36:18,519
Mr. Cooke...

429
00:36:18,693 --> 00:36:21,662
...the claim is that you're an expert
in criminal science, correct?

430
00:36:21,829 --> 00:36:25,526
- Yes.
- Down here, I'm the expert in land finance.

431
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:30,603
So why don't we both just focus on
our respective areas of expertise, okay?

432
00:36:30,771 --> 00:36:33,171
Time's slipping away here.

433
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:38,006
All right, what's the first rule
of robbing a bank?

434
00:36:38,179 --> 00:36:40,374
- No one gets killed.
- The second?

435
00:36:40,548 --> 00:36:42,607
Don't take more than you can carry
in one hand.

436
00:36:42,783 --> 00:36:45,047
- And the third?
- Getting away is the first rule.

437
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:46,613
Perfect.

438
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:49,046
So do you think we're ready?

439
00:36:49,523 --> 00:36:52,117
Well, you really only needed
to know one thing all along...

440
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:54,158
...and you learned that back in the river.

441
00:36:54,328 --> 00:36:56,023
Trust your partner with your life.

442
00:36:58,366 --> 00:37:01,392
Why did you make us go through
everything else if we were ready?

443
00:37:02,403 --> 00:37:03,631
Well...

444
00:37:03,804 --> 00:37:05,965
...I kind of liked having you two around.

445
00:37:09,877 --> 00:37:11,208
Now go rob me some banks.

446
00:37:44,312 --> 00:37:45,540
Everybody, hands up.

447
00:38:18,012 --> 00:38:20,572
Are you sure the room
has been left undisturbed...

448
00:38:20,748 --> 00:38:22,272
...since the death?
- Yes.

449
00:38:23,351 --> 00:38:26,286
- You've worked here for a long time?
- Almost 20 years.

450
00:38:29,256 --> 00:38:32,453
Do you know if he took any medication
for his heart condition?

451
00:38:32,626 --> 00:38:35,789
Don Diego was healthy as a horse.

452
00:38:35,963 --> 00:38:38,124
He was never sick a day in his life.

453
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:41,258
Thank you.

454
00:38:41,435 --> 00:38:43,767
If you'll excuse me.

455
00:39:11,298 --> 00:39:14,358
This should cover the mortgage
on the five farms north of the river.

456
00:39:14,535 --> 00:39:17,561
I was thinking, you know,
we already have a lot of money.

457
00:39:17,738 --> 00:39:20,536
Maybe we should stop
before the regulators...

458
00:39:20,708 --> 00:39:23,108
Padre, they took 10 banks,
we take 10 banks.

459
00:39:23,277 --> 00:39:27,179
- Right. We still have five to go.
- Four.

460
00:39:27,348 --> 00:39:28,645
That's what I said. Four.

461
00:39:28,816 --> 00:39:32,547
But one of my parishioners
told me about a specialist...

462
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:35,951
...they brought in.
- A specialist?

463
00:39:36,524 --> 00:39:39,288
- For us?
- I'm afraid yes.

464
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:41,451
A detective from New York.

465
00:39:42,363 --> 00:39:44,024
Let him come.

466
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:56,633
Are you Padre Pablo?

467
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:58,608
Yes.

468
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,475
- May I come in?
- No.

469
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:06,412
I thought the house of God was open
to all people at all times.

470
00:40:06,787 --> 00:40:10,780
It is. But God is not at home right now.

471
00:40:10,958 --> 00:40:14,553
He is down the road at the orphanage...

472
00:40:14,728 --> 00:40:17,390
...where I was just going.

473
00:40:18,399 --> 00:40:20,560
I'm Quentin Cooke.

474
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:24,031
I know who you are, Mr. Cooke.

475
00:40:24,205 --> 00:40:25,399
Oh, you do?

476
00:40:25,573 --> 00:40:28,736
It's my job to know
what concerns my flock.

477
00:40:29,577 --> 00:40:32,239
Okay. Well, then maybe you can help me.

478
00:40:32,947 --> 00:40:34,244
This girl.

479
00:40:34,415 --> 00:40:36,906
- I was wondering if you could tell me...
- No.

480
00:40:38,285 --> 00:40:39,582
I didn't finish the question.

481
00:40:39,954 --> 00:40:42,354
You want to know if I have seen her.

482
00:40:42,923 --> 00:40:45,289
No, I'm sure you haven't seen her.

483
00:40:45,459 --> 00:40:48,394
I was wondering if you could tell me
if she had any problems...

484
00:40:48,562 --> 00:40:51,087
...with her father.
- I loved my father.

485
00:40:51,265 --> 00:40:52,926
Why does he ask such a question?

486
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:55,159
She loved her father.

487
00:40:55,336 --> 00:40:57,861
Why do you ask such a question?

488
00:40:58,038 --> 00:40:59,699
Just the way he died.

489
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:01,936
Anyway...

490
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:05,678
I'm staying at the hotel...

491
00:41:05,846 --> 00:41:07,939
...in Santa Rita
if you have any information.

492
00:41:14,922 --> 00:41:17,652
What did he mean
about the way my father died?

493
00:41:17,825 --> 00:41:19,725
You heard what I heard.

494
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:23,489
If you want to know any more,
you will have to ask him.

495
00:41:29,069 --> 00:41:31,936
Come on. Come.

496
00:41:48,889 --> 00:41:50,914
We can take him right here.

497
00:41:52,059 --> 00:41:53,526
- What?
- Wonderful.

498
00:41:53,694 --> 00:41:56,390
- And how do we get the information?
- We ask him.

499
00:41:56,697 --> 00:41:59,757
Our picture's all over the town.

500
00:42:03,237 --> 00:42:05,569
So what? We wear bandannas.

501
00:42:05,739 --> 00:42:07,366
I have a better plan.

502
00:42:08,375 --> 00:42:12,072
Hello, mister. Do you want company?

503
00:42:41,976 --> 00:42:44,570
- What are you doing?
- Saving time.

504
00:42:49,550 --> 00:42:51,450
Yes?

505
00:42:58,692 --> 00:43:00,853
Wrong room.

506
00:43:01,028 --> 00:43:03,758
No. We're compliments
of the management.

507
00:43:05,065 --> 00:43:08,091
- She's new.
- I don't mean to offend you, ladies...

508
00:43:08,302 --> 00:43:09,860
...but I have a fiancée.

509
00:43:10,037 --> 00:43:12,665
- And we have some questions.
- Hands up.

510
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:15,468
- Down.
- Up.

511
00:43:15,643 --> 00:43:16,871
- Down.
- Up.

512
00:43:17,044 --> 00:43:20,172
- Down.
- Excuse us for a minute.

513
00:43:20,347 --> 00:43:23,578
- What? You've never seen one before?
- Yes, but in the dark.

514
00:43:23,751 --> 00:43:24,979
Up.

515
00:43:25,152 --> 00:43:27,416
- My wallet's over there.
- This is not a robbery.

516
00:43:28,722 --> 00:43:30,519
Oh, my God.

517
00:43:31,058 --> 00:43:33,686
- You're them.
- Yes, it's us.

518
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:36,659
Well, you're not getting any answers
out of me.

519
00:43:36,830 --> 00:43:39,424
I will not dishonor my profession.

520
00:43:40,301 --> 00:43:41,962
Hey.

521
00:43:47,241 --> 00:43:50,074
- Hey, what are you doing?
- We'll ask the questions.

522
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:52,941
Is this the fiancée?

523
00:43:53,113 --> 00:43:54,341
Not bad.

524
00:43:54,515 --> 00:43:57,814
- What are you doing?
- Puts me in the mood.

525
00:44:02,589 --> 00:44:04,216
- Ready?
- Smile.

526
00:44:11,899 --> 00:44:13,594
Beautiful.

527
00:44:14,968 --> 00:44:17,459
Unless you tell us everything
we want to know...

528
00:44:17,638 --> 00:44:21,631
...these pictures will show up in every
newspaper from here to New York.

529
00:44:22,276 --> 00:44:24,437
With a special set going to your fiancée.

530
00:44:25,713 --> 00:44:29,308
Then you won't have to worry
about dishonoring your profession.

531
00:44:29,483 --> 00:44:30,916
Because you won't have one.

532
00:44:33,554 --> 00:44:35,454
Now tell me about my father.

533
00:44:37,091 --> 00:44:38,319
I won't tell you anything.

534
00:44:38,492 --> 00:44:40,357
- This is a waste of time.
- Hey, hey.

535
00:44:40,527 --> 00:44:43,428
Excuse my partner.
She's a bit impetuous.

536
00:44:43,597 --> 00:44:47,397
Mr. Cooke, I am asking you
as a daughter who lost her father.

537
00:44:54,141 --> 00:44:56,837
- Did your father drink wine?
- His passion.

538
00:44:57,044 --> 00:45:00,241
I don't think he died of a heart attack.
I think he was poisoned.
