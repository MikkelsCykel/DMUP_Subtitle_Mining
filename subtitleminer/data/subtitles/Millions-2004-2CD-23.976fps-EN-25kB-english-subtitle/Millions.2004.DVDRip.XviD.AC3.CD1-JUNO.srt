1
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:20,319
The French have said
au revoir to the franc.

2
00:00:20,653 --> 00:00:24,419
The Germans have said
auf wiedersehen to the Deutschmark.

3
00:00:24,557 --> 00:00:28,516
And the Portuguese have said
whatever to their thing.

4
00:00:28,962 --> 00:00:29,621
Go!

5
00:00:29,763 --> 00:00:32,732
Now it's our turn to say
goodbye to Sterling.

6
00:00:34,267 --> 00:00:37,236
This Christmas
we are going to get the euro.

7
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,133
Goodbye old pound.

8
00:00:39,272 --> 00:00:40,933
Everyone says
we are going to miss you.

9
00:00:41,074 --> 00:00:42,837
- Come on!
- Faster! Faster!

10
00:00:42,976 --> 00:00:44,637
- Hey come on!
- Faster!

11
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:50,014
I can't see ya!
Where are you?

12
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:52,015
I'm over here!

13
00:00:52,152 --> 00:00:54,712
This is the main drag along here.

14
00:00:54,854 --> 00:00:56,822
That's Portland.

15
00:00:56,956 --> 00:01:01,620
Bisecting that at right angles,
is Lundy on that side.

16
00:01:01,761 --> 00:01:05,629
On this side there's Fastnet.
What's yours?

17
00:01:05,765 --> 00:01:07,027
Cromarty.

18
00:01:07,167 --> 00:01:09,226
Cromarty and German Bight.

19
00:01:09,369 --> 00:01:11,837
Cul de sacs. Over here.

20
00:01:12,372 --> 00:01:16,138
- I've come through.
- Come on! Come on, Damian!

21
00:01:16,276 --> 00:01:18,642
There's a train coming!

22
00:01:22,682 --> 00:01:25,116
Keep pedalling. Come on!

23
00:01:27,353 --> 00:01:28,820
Faster!

24
00:01:31,558 --> 00:01:33,617
- Beat ya!
- Come on!

25
00:01:38,865 --> 00:01:41,026
I'm gonna call it Serendipity.

26
00:01:41,167 --> 00:01:43,533
- What does that mean?
- I don't know.

27
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:46,332
- Anyway it's number twenty.
- Upstairs!

28
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:49,537
- This is my room.
- And mine.

29
00:01:50,577 --> 00:01:52,340
Get your own room.

30
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:50,536
The patron saint of
house removals is Saint Anne.

31
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:53,138
- Did you know that?
- No, I didn't know that, no.

32
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:55,833
Yeah, she lived in
the desert, obviously.

33
00:02:55,975 --> 00:02:57,533
And when she wanted to move house.

34
00:02:57,677 --> 00:03:00,441
Angels came, picked up her house
and took it to Italy.

35
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:01,842
Handy.

36
00:03:10,256 --> 00:03:11,814
She was Our Lady's mother.

37
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:13,118
What you on about Damian?

38
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:14,726
Saint Anne. I've got a picture.

39
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:17,523
Look. I don't care, just get
in the car, will ya? We're going'.

40
00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:19,723
Go on! Get in the car!

41
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:25,037
- Was she in it at the time?
- Who?

42
00:03:25,171 --> 00:03:27,833
Saint Anne.
When the angels did the...

43
00:03:27,974 --> 00:03:30,033
you know the airlift?

44
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:31,541
I don't know.

45
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,310
Start with the money.

46
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:12,418
That's what our Anthony says.

47
00:04:12,552 --> 00:04:14,816
That's what people
want to know about.

48
00:04:14,954 --> 00:04:16,615
Like if you're moving house...

49
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:20,317
you don't say 'we're moving house
and the new one has got a green door.'

50
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:22,121
You say how much you're paying.

51
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,526
How much you got for the old one.

52
00:04:24,664 --> 00:04:29,727
Mortgage. Interest rates.
Stamp duty. Solicitor's fees.

53
00:04:29,869 --> 00:04:32,736
How much you'll get
if the new one goes up in value.

54
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:34,237
That's called equity.

55
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:36,239
Personally, I think, 'so what? '

56
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:37,741
Money's just a thing.

57
00:04:37,877 --> 00:04:39,139
And things change.

58
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:42,248
One minute something's there
and you can cuddle up to it.

59
00:04:42,382 --> 00:04:44,111
The next minute it's gone.

60
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,013
Like a Malteser.

61
00:04:46,152 --> 00:04:47,517
That goes in the kitchen.

62
00:04:48,154 --> 00:04:49,815
Is this fantastic or what?

63
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:52,720
Surprisingly spacious,
with attractive views.

64
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:54,121
Oh, that's Anthony's.
That must go upstairs and...

65
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,023
And anyway, in the end,

66
00:04:56,162 --> 00:04:59,325
it turns out it wasn't about
the money after all.

67
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:02,632
That's it lads.
Up to the main bedroom.

68
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:04,737
Has anyone seen
where the phone points are?

69
00:05:05,371 --> 00:05:08,738
Eh, where do I plug this in?

70
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:11,844
Oh, right, yeah.
Oh that looks good, that does.

71
00:06:00,827 --> 00:06:01,418
Right

72
00:06:02,428 --> 00:06:04,862
this is what
we're having' tonight, yeah?

73
00:06:04,964 --> 00:06:06,727
Before Countdown,
put the oven on.

74
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:08,925
After Countdown,
get a packet of these,

75
00:06:09,068 --> 00:06:10,228
put them in there
with some oven chips, yeah?

76
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,132
It's for mum.

77
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:13,033
The time is on here, yeah.

78
00:06:13,172 --> 00:06:13,773
Ok.

79
00:06:13,773 --> 00:06:15,035
That's how long
they have to stay in.

80
00:06:15,174 --> 00:06:17,642
By the time they're ready,
I'll be back.

81
00:06:17,777 --> 00:06:21,042
She may already have
won ten thousand pounds.

82
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,307
Her name has been entered in a draw.

83
00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:25,508
- All she has to do is...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

84
00:06:26,152 --> 00:06:27,119
Thank you.

85
00:06:27,253 --> 00:06:28,311
Hands?

86
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:30,215
Other sides.

87
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,522
Let's go.

88
00:06:35,661 --> 00:06:36,719
Come on!

89
00:06:37,964 --> 00:06:39,022
That's you.

90
00:06:39,665 --> 00:06:40,927
Get your bags.

91
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:43,331
And your book bag, Damian.
Keyssss...

92
00:06:51,277 --> 00:06:53,245
Now remember
it's no good being clever,

93
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:54,641
you've got to be
the cleverest, yeah?

94
00:06:54,781 --> 00:06:56,339
- Alright. See ya Dad.
- Good luck lads.

95
00:06:56,482 --> 00:06:58,313
See ya.
Are you nervous?

96
00:06:58,451 --> 00:06:59,418
A bit.

97
00:07:05,358 --> 00:07:08,521
So everybody sitting up nicely?
Excellent.

98
00:07:08,661 --> 00:07:10,925
Now we are talking, today,
about people we admire.

99
00:07:11,063 --> 00:07:13,623
- Dminic?
- Roy Keane, Sir, Manchester United.

100
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:15,131
Very good, Roy Keane.

101
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:15,927
What about you Barry?

102
00:07:16,068 --> 00:07:18,127
- Van Nistelrooy, sir.
- Van Nistelrooy, right.

103
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:21,035
Anyone got any heroes
who don't play for United?

104
00:07:21,174 --> 00:07:23,335
- Jack?
- Robbie Fowler, Sir, City.

105
00:07:24,877 --> 00:07:26,435
Alright, that's enough.

106
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:27,546
Tricia?

107
00:07:28,181 --> 00:07:29,910
I don't know any footballers, sir.

108
00:07:30,049 --> 00:07:31,311
Well, it doesn't have
to be a footballer,

109
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,316
it could be... anyone.

110
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:36,013
- Don't know sir.
- No?

111
00:07:36,155 --> 00:07:37,417
Damian?

112
00:07:37,557 --> 00:07:38,819
Saint Roch, sir.

113
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:41,426
- Who's he play for?
- No one sir, he's a Saint.

114
00:07:41,561 --> 00:07:43,324
Oh that's better, go on.

115
00:07:44,363 --> 00:07:46,831
He was so worried that
he might say something bad.

116
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:49,526
That he said nothing
at all for twenty years.

117
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:52,035
We could do with a couple
like him in this class.

118
00:07:52,171 --> 00:07:52,933
Thank you, Damian.

119
00:07:53,072 --> 00:07:55,438
I like a lot of virgin martyrs too.

120
00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:57,042
Like Saint Agatha.

121
00:07:57,176 --> 00:07:58,438
She ripped her own eyes out,

122
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:00,842
so she wouldn't have
to marry this man.

123
00:08:02,081 --> 00:08:04,208
Or Saint Katherine of Alexandria.

124
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:07,319
They tried to kill her by crushing
her to death on a wheel.

125
00:08:07,453 --> 00:08:09,318
But she made the wheel explode

126
00:08:09,455 --> 00:08:12,515
and all the splinters
killed people in the crowd.

127
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:15,124
The patron Saint of fireworks.

128
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:17,024
That's where we get
the Catherine wheel from.

129
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:19,222
I did say thank you, Damian.

130
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,225
Right, I brought in this picture.

131
00:08:22,368 --> 00:08:25,826
This is a hero of mine.
Who knows who this is?

132
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:29,635
- Nelson Mandela?
- Fantastic, Nelson Mandela.

133
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,722
I should be careful
what you talk about.

134
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:48,122
Try talking about football
or something.

135
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:50,920
Keep off the weird stuff.

136
00:08:51,063 --> 00:08:54,032
Just don't be conspicuous
or you won't fit in.

137
00:09:23,462 --> 00:09:27,228
Aero and a Yorkie please.
And five juicy lips.

138
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:30,934
Haven't seen you two here, before.

139
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,731
We just moved here.

140
00:09:32,872 --> 00:09:34,339
Our mam's dead.

141
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:38,844
Yeah, well go on, you're alright.

142
00:09:38,978 --> 00:09:40,036
- Thanks.
- God bless.

143
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:40,941
Who's next?

144
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:41,739
Works every time.

145
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:45,112
You tell them your mam's dead
and they give you stuff, every time.

146
00:09:56,162 --> 00:09:58,824
I'm your... Community Policeman.

147
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:01,827
Obviously there is
no community here as yet,

148
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:04,835
not to speak of, but you know...

149
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:08,340
Anyway the first thing to say is,

150
00:10:08,474 --> 00:10:11,841
these new houses
and Christmas coming up.

151
00:10:11,978 --> 00:10:14,947
Statistically
you're going to get burgled.

152
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:18,608
Now, not all of you, but some of you, soon.

153
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:21,720
Probably this week, next.

154
00:10:22,254 --> 00:10:25,314
When you are, call me.

155
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:29,127
I'll give you a crime number

156
00:10:29,261 --> 00:10:34,130
and then you can make a claim
on your insurance.

157
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,937
Building maintenance?

158
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:40,530
Yeah, that's right, yeah.

159
00:10:40,673 --> 00:10:43,437
Yeah, I'm usually right,
it's a knack.

160
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:47,942
Do you mind me asking?
Is the kettle actually on? I'm...

161
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,342
Oh, sorry.

162
00:10:49,782 --> 00:10:50,612
Yes?

163
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:54,015
Isn't the problem here,
that our houses are built on sand?

164
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:55,916
Sand? No.

165
00:10:56,355 --> 00:10:57,413
They're not are they?

166
00:10:57,556 --> 00:11:01,117
If you store up your treasure
on earth it will be stolen.

167
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:04,627
But if you give it away,
then it can't be stolen.

168
00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:06,823
Mormons?

169
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:09,434
Well, Latter Day Saints.

170
00:11:09,568 --> 00:11:10,728
Saints?

171
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:11,734
I know all about them...

172
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:12,735
Errr... Damian,

173
00:11:12,872 --> 00:11:14,635
go and give Terry a hand
in the kitchen will you?

174
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:17,038
You too Anthony,
off you go, good lads.

175
00:11:18,577 --> 00:11:21,341
Now, some of you are
going to be burgled.

176
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,505
There are things I can tell you,

177
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:25,810
that will lower the odds
of it being you personally.

178
00:11:25,951 --> 00:11:27,316
It's a bit anti-social,

179
00:11:27,453 --> 00:11:28,613
because if it isn't
you then it'll be next door,

180
00:11:28,754 --> 00:11:30,619
but ha-ha there you go.

181
00:11:32,558 --> 00:11:33,923
Our mam's dead.

182
00:11:41,567 --> 00:11:42,829
Here. Go on, help yourself.

183
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:46,528
Take as many as you like, son.

184
00:12:01,854 --> 00:12:03,014
Result.

185
00:12:04,356 --> 00:12:06,415
Is it completely honest?

186
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:10,228
Completely dead isn't she?

187
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:49,127
What?

188
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:54,234
What do you want?

189
00:12:56,575 --> 00:12:58,338
Can't you see I'm busy?

190
00:12:58,477 --> 00:12:59,739
Just go away.

191
00:13:18,063 --> 00:13:20,327
I don't like having my own room.

192
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:06,636
Clare of Assisi,

193
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:09,543
Eleven Ninety Four till
Twelve Fifty Three?

194
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:10,614
That's right.

195
00:14:13,452 --> 00:14:16,012
I used to have a hermitage,
myself, once.

196
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:24,028
I used to go and hide up there.

197
00:14:24,163 --> 00:14:27,428
If anyone needed me,
I'd send them a vision, sort them out.

198
00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:30,034
That's why I'm the patron
saint of television.

199
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:33,229
I was like... human television.

200
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:35,840
You're the patron saint
of television?

201
00:14:35,975 --> 00:14:36,942
Keeps me busy.

202
00:14:37,076 --> 00:14:38,043
You know?

203
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,247
Are you allowed to smoke then?

204
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:45,408
You can do what you
like up there, son.

205
00:14:46,151 --> 00:14:48,619
It's down here,
you have to make the effort.

206
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:53,616
Do you ever come across
a Saint Maureen?

207
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:55,522
She hasn't been there long.

208
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:57,323
Don't ring a bell.

209
00:14:58,364 --> 00:15:01,128
Then again,
it is infinite up there.

210
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:06,231
Absolutely bloody infinite.

211
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:11,035
Listen...

212
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:26,818
Dad.

213
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,011
What is it anyway?

214
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:57,622
What are you doing
with all these boxes?

215
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:03,127
- What's that?
- Wait and see.

216
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:14,737
Where did you get that?

217
00:16:14,873 --> 00:16:16,932
You can see it too then?

218
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:18,043
Well... you know...

219
00:16:18,177 --> 00:16:20,737
sometimes you see things.
Don't you?

220
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:23,040
And other people can't see them.

221
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:25,512
What?

222
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:29,314
Well... you know... sometimes,
but this is real though.

223
00:16:30,055 --> 00:16:33,115
This is real. This is real

224
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:35,626
Can't wait to tell dad.

225
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:37,729
You can't tell dad about this.

226
00:16:37,863 --> 00:16:39,626
You can't tell anyone about this.

227
00:16:39,765 --> 00:16:40,925
Why not?

228
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:42,226
Tax.

229
00:16:43,268 --> 00:16:45,236
If the government
find out about this,

230
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:47,635
they'll take forty percent
of it away.

231
00:16:47,773 --> 00:16:49,138
Forty percent!

232
00:16:49,274 --> 00:16:50,935
Do you know how much that is?

233
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:53,042
Nearly all of it.

234
00:17:02,554 --> 00:17:04,317
Shall we count it before we go?

235
00:17:05,457 --> 00:17:07,425
No, we can't we're really late.

236
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,026
How much? How much?

237
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:16,225
There's thousands.

238
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:17,027
Ten thousand.

239
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:18,932
- Fifty thousand.
- Seventy.

240
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:20,129
Two hundred thousand.

241
00:17:20,272 --> 00:17:21,933
Millions even.

242
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:26,538
Patch... Jenga.

243
00:17:26,979 --> 00:17:28,947
Oink. Oink. Oink. Oink.

244
00:17:32,351 --> 00:17:33,818
Promise not to tell anyone.

245
00:17:33,952 --> 00:17:35,112
What is it?

246
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:37,922
- How much is it?
- Thousands.

247
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:39,422
Hundreds.

248
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:41,116
It's just hundreds.

249
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,318
No one else knows.

250
00:17:42,461 --> 00:17:45,521
So if anyone finds out,
we'll know it's you. Ok?

251
00:17:49,968 --> 00:17:52,528
Anyone finds out we know it's you.

252
00:17:52,671 --> 00:17:54,332
No one else knows.

253
00:17:54,473 --> 00:17:56,134
Just me and you. Here.

254
00:17:56,775 --> 00:17:57,935
Thanks.

255
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,544
Yeah, just keep it shut.

256
00:18:11,156 --> 00:18:12,817
Two hundred and twenty nine thousand,

257
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:15,518
five hundred and
twenty pounds, minus...

258
00:18:15,661 --> 00:18:18,129
a hundred quid each,
spending money.

259
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:20,424
Leaves two hundred
and twenty nine thousand,

260
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:21,828
three hundred and twenty quid.

261
00:18:21,967 --> 00:18:24,527
And we're going to give
all that to the poor.

262
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:26,729
Where you going to find poor people?

263
00:18:26,872 --> 00:18:28,635
There's loads of poor people.

264
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:31,743
Not round here.
The house prices keep them out.

265
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:02,534
Go on. Go. Go.

266
00:19:12,851 --> 00:19:17,618
Go on. Go. Go. Go on.
Go. Go. Go. Go on.

267
00:19:17,756 --> 00:19:18,814
Go on.

268
00:19:25,764 --> 00:19:27,026
Francis of Assisi?

269
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:30,431
Eleven eighty one till
twelve twenty six.

270
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:32,127
You did this didn't you?

271
00:19:32,271 --> 00:19:34,136
My first act as a Saint.

272
00:19:42,581 --> 00:19:44,105
What was your next one?

273
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,010
Washing a leper.

274
00:19:46,151 --> 00:19:47,209
A leper?

275
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:49,320
You could just help
the poor Damian.

276
00:19:52,658 --> 00:19:54,523
Big Issue. Help the homeless.

277
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,827
Big Issue anyone?

278
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:00,825
Oh hello.

279
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:02,228
And keep the change.

280
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:05,336
Oh, thanks mate,
I've had nothing to eat all day.

281
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:07,734
Oh we're going to Pizza Hut,
want to come.

282
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:11,331
No... no. She doesn't.
She just wants more money.

283
00:20:11,476 --> 00:20:14,536
- We haven't got any more.
- No I fancy pizza actually.

284
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,238
Can I bring my friend?

285
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:28,222
Meat feast, deep and juicy,
stuffed crust mate.

286
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,725
Two meat feast thin and crispy.

287
00:20:29,861 --> 00:20:32,022
- Ah a big New Yorker.
- A combo platter.

288
00:20:32,164 --> 00:20:34,325
- Do us a farmhouse.
- I'll have some garlic bread love.

289
00:20:34,466 --> 00:20:35,831
We'll all have some
garlic bread won't we?

290
00:20:35,968 --> 00:20:38,630
And Dippin' Chicken.
To share.

291
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:43,439
This is great. Anthony thought
there were no poor people round here.

292
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:45,543
Because of the house prices.

293
00:20:45,677 --> 00:20:47,144
Well they're not from round here.

294
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:49,440
- Come in on the bus.
- I come in on the train.

295
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:50,605
Couldn't afford to
live round here.

296
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:52,410
Who exactly is paying
for all this?

297
00:20:52,551 --> 00:20:53,813
We are.

298
00:20:54,653 --> 00:20:56,314
- You must be minted!
- Yeah we are.

299
00:20:56,455 --> 00:20:59,117
No... no, we're not.

300
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:00,316
It's birthday money.

301
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:02,120
His birthday money,
he saved it.

302
00:21:03,061 --> 00:21:05,029
- Puddings?
- Yes please.

303
00:21:05,163 --> 00:21:06,425
No.

304
00:21:06,565 --> 00:21:08,624
One hundred and sixty eight quid.

305
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:10,325
Do you know how many times
we'd have to visit Pizza Hut

306
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:11,629
to get rid of all the money?

307
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:14,739
One thousand, three hundred and
three point five one seven times.

308
00:21:14,873 --> 00:21:16,340
It's just not practical.

309
00:21:16,475 --> 00:21:18,033
We should buy property.

310
00:21:18,176 --> 00:21:20,940
See this house,
we could buy two like that.

311
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:23,047
If they knocked some off
the asking price.

312
00:21:23,181 --> 00:21:25,615
And if we did buy property,
that'll go up in value.

313
00:21:25,751 --> 00:21:27,616
So we'd have even more money.

314
00:21:28,553 --> 00:21:29,611
Damian?

315
00:21:38,363 --> 00:21:39,830
Excuse me?

316
00:21:41,266 --> 00:21:42,233
Are you poor?

317
00:21:42,367 --> 00:21:43,231
Beg your pardon?

318
00:21:43,368 --> 00:21:44,835
Are you poor?

319
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,437
Are you asking for money?

320
00:21:46,571 --> 00:21:48,038
Me? No.

321
00:21:48,173 --> 00:21:50,038
Because we don't have any.

322
00:21:50,175 --> 00:21:53,440
We live in a community,
you know, it's very basic.

323
00:21:53,578 --> 00:21:57,105
We don't have a dishwasher
for instance or a microwave.

324
00:21:57,249 --> 00:21:59,308
And there's no cash kept
on the premises.

325
00:21:59,451 --> 00:22:01,214
So you are poor?

326
00:22:02,854 --> 00:22:04,412
In a sense, yes.

327
00:22:04,556 --> 00:22:05,818
Brilliant!

328
00:22:16,468 --> 00:22:19,733
Invergi. Invergi

329
00:22:20,972 --> 00:22:22,940
St. Nicholas of Myra?

330
00:22:23,075 --> 00:22:25,339
Sanctus quartus saeculus sum...

331
00:22:25,477 --> 00:22:29,743
Patronus de nautae et,
vero, natalis.

332
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,411
It won't all fit.

333
00:22:33,552 --> 00:22:36,919
El fini errant centi cetus poplas

334
00:22:44,963 --> 00:22:46,430
Saint Nicholas?

335
00:22:46,565 --> 00:22:49,033
Do you ever come across
a Saint Maureen?

336
00:22:49,167 --> 00:22:52,227
- Ques?
- Saint Maureen. She's new.

337
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:53,633
Quat facki abat?

338
00:22:53,772 --> 00:22:57,435
Skin care. She worked on
the make-up counter at Selfridges.

339
00:22:57,576 --> 00:22:59,043
Sel-frid-ges?

340
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:02,842
To betal?

341
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:06,210
Est a quero publican rodeo.

342
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:14,116
It's less than a fortnight to E-day.

343
00:23:14,259 --> 00:23:16,022
That's when
Britain completes transition

344
00:23:16,161 --> 00:23:19,130
to the European Monitory Union.
The EMU.

345
00:23:19,264 --> 00:23:25,635
Oh with twelve days left to E-day,
my true love said to me.

346
00:23:25,771 --> 00:23:31,334
The transitional exchange rate
is fixed at sixty seven p.

347
00:23:31,676 --> 00:23:36,045
Oh! Well all I can say is...
ding dong

348
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:40,206
After E-day your old money
will no longer be legal tender.

349
00:23:40,352 --> 00:23:42,912
Wish pounds goodbye and euros...

350
00:23:43,054 --> 00:23:44,715
Hello.

351
00:24:48,753 --> 00:24:50,220
We don't have to queue up.

352
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:54,818
Here we go.

353
00:24:57,262 --> 00:24:59,321
How much have you actually got?

354
00:24:59,464 --> 00:25:00,522
Plenty.

355
00:25:08,874 --> 00:25:10,842
- Anthony Cunningham.
- Where's your dad?

356
00:25:10,976 --> 00:25:12,841
My dad? Well he's not coming.

357
00:25:12,978 --> 00:25:13,945
Eh?

358
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:16,240
Yeah, he's not coming yet.
He said to start without him.

359
00:25:16,381 --> 00:25:17,814
Start what without him?

360
00:25:17,949 --> 00:25:19,416
The job is to show him
around the apartment.

361
00:25:19,551 --> 00:25:21,712
How can I do that,
if he isn't here?

362
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:23,115
He gave me this.

363
00:25:24,155 --> 00:25:26,419
Show me around and
I'll fill him in afterwards.

364
00:25:26,558 --> 00:25:28,423
It's what we usually do.

365
00:25:32,063 --> 00:25:34,122
We're looking at this for our
investment portfolio.

366
00:25:34,266 --> 00:25:35,733
Not as a residence.

367
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:37,232
Has it kept it's value?

368
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:39,428
It's gone up twenty percent
in the last two years,

369
00:25:39,571 --> 00:25:41,038
because of the schools.

370
00:25:41,172 --> 00:25:42,833
He does send you to school doesn't he?

371
00:25:42,974 --> 00:25:45,135
Or do you just
look at photos of them?

372
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:50,811
Flood lights. Scoreboards. Stadium.

373
00:25:50,949 --> 00:25:55,113
It's the dogs bollocks this,
family heirloom. Fifty quid?

374
00:25:55,253 --> 00:25:56,311
Fifty quid?

375
00:25:56,454 --> 00:25:58,422
You could buy
a proper football team for that.

376
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:00,525
I could buy Crewe Alexander for that.

377
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:04,220
Yeah but...
this has got managers.

378
00:26:04,362 --> 00:26:06,421
Dan Leavy and Malcolm Allinson

379
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:08,123
Never heard of him.

380
00:26:08,266 --> 00:26:09,324
Deal.

381
00:26:12,771 --> 00:26:14,534
You said you would for five quid.

382
00:26:14,673 --> 00:26:16,732
I didn't know you were going
to get five quid did I?

383
00:26:16,875 --> 00:26:18,433
Ten quid then?

384
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:20,636
Look, I've got a good body.

385
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,311
Twenty quid, last offer.

386
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:46,532
Martyrs of Uganda,
eighteen eighty one?

387
00:26:46,671 --> 00:26:47,933
That's right.

388
00:26:49,674 --> 00:26:51,835
Ohhhh sorry about that.

389
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:55,644
I was beheaded. See.

390
00:26:56,081 --> 00:26:59,107
Before that I was in construction.

391
00:26:59,651 --> 00:27:02,916
I don't know who built this,
but they were a right cowboy.

392
00:27:03,054 --> 00:27:04,919
I built it myself.

393
00:27:05,056 --> 00:27:07,820
Well, you'll see what we can do.

394
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:09,517
But I can't promise anything.

395
00:27:09,661 --> 00:27:11,526
Why not?
There's plenty of you.

396
00:27:11,663 --> 00:27:15,121
Yes, come on welcome.

397
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:24,533
Hello.

398
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,515
What are they singing?

399
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:40,420
They are praying for rain.

400
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,421
Where I come from...

401
00:27:44,262 --> 00:27:47,322
people have to pay a tenth
of their daily income on water.

402
00:27:48,566 --> 00:27:52,229
It's so expensive that they can't
afford to wash their hands.

403
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:54,231
So they get disease.

404
00:27:55,273 --> 00:27:58,936
You don't need fancy hospitals
or medicines to make life better,

405
00:27:59,077 --> 00:28:01,637
just a well.
And you...

406
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:05,307
can build a well for as
little as one hundred pounds.

407
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:08,317
That's fantastic!
Thanks.

408
00:28:23,668 --> 00:28:25,932
I'm sorry I don't know who you are.

409
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:27,929
Mutual that then.

410
00:28:30,275 --> 00:28:31,435
This yours?

411
00:28:33,678 --> 00:28:34,736
Nice.

412
00:28:37,649 --> 00:28:38,809
Near a railway.

413
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,123
- What's in there?
- Nothing really.

414
00:29:00,472 --> 00:29:04,738
- What's this?
- A dress. It was my mums.

415
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:17,312
What are you looking for?

416
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:23,020
Money.

417
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:25,729
Are you poor?

418
00:29:26,564 --> 00:29:27,622
What?

419
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:29,233
Damian, come in.

420
00:29:29,367 --> 00:29:30,629
Anthony to Damian...

421
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:31,369
What's that?

422
00:29:31,369 --> 00:29:33,132
- Damian, where are you?
- My brother I've got to go.

423
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:36,035
I'll come back. I've got loads.
Just wait there.

424
00:29:37,075 --> 00:29:39,737
- Loads of what?
- Money. Just wait there.

425
00:29:39,878 --> 00:29:43,609
Five... four...
three... two...

426
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:46,208
Who's that?

427
00:29:46,351 --> 00:29:48,819
A poor person and
you said there weren't any.

428
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:50,716
I know. But who is it?

429
00:29:50,855 --> 00:29:53,323
I don't know. Just someone.

430
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:55,323
What do you mean 'someone'?

431
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,121
Did he do anything to you?

432
00:29:57,962 --> 00:30:00,931
- What sort of things?
- Never mind.

433
00:30:01,065 --> 00:30:04,626
Look people are weird.
You've got to be more careful.

434
00:30:04,769 --> 00:30:06,430
You shouldn't really talk to them.

435
00:30:06,571 --> 00:30:07,936
Anyway I've told him now.

436
00:30:08,072 --> 00:30:11,235
- Told him what?
- That we have tons of money.

437
00:30:11,776 --> 00:30:13,038
He's poor.

438
00:30:14,379 --> 00:30:15,437
What?

439
00:30:20,552 --> 00:30:22,918
Nothing. Nothing.
Leave it to me.

440
00:30:31,563 --> 00:30:32,723
Where is he then?

441
00:30:32,864 --> 00:30:35,526
I don't know.
He was here a minute ago.

442
00:30:48,479 --> 00:30:49,639
See.

443
00:30:49,948 --> 00:30:54,009
Loads of money.
We've been saving it up for ages.

444
00:30:55,453 --> 00:30:57,318
You can have it if you need it.

445
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:00,915
Come on Damian.

446
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:04,121
You'll have to change it quickly.

447
00:31:14,172 --> 00:31:16,436
Do you think that was really enough?

448
00:31:16,574 --> 00:31:17,836
More than enough.

449
00:31:18,676 --> 00:31:20,735
That's him completely sorted out.

450
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:24,305
Right. Have you given money
to anyone else?

451
00:31:24,449 --> 00:31:25,711
Not really.

452
00:31:48,473 --> 00:31:49,531
What?

453
00:31:53,778 --> 00:31:55,541
It wasn't that much.

454
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,307
Just like a bagful.

455
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:05,120
- What's that?
- Scuba scooter.

456
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:08,020
It goes at ten mile an hour
for up to five hours.

457
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:11,219
We could have one of them.
We could have one each.

458
00:32:11,362 --> 00:32:13,421
We could have a whole fleet.

459
00:32:13,564 --> 00:32:15,429
She's nice.

460
00:32:15,566 --> 00:32:18,034
Huh! I've seen better.
Close the door.

461
00:32:27,879 --> 00:32:29,847
Look you can see it protruding.

462
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:32,508
- What is it?
- It's a nipple.

463
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:34,015
What's it for?

464
00:32:35,153 --> 00:32:37,713
Well it's for feeding babies.

465
00:32:38,856 --> 00:32:40,118
Did mum have one?

466
00:32:40,258 --> 00:32:42,123
Two. They've all got two.

467
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:44,023
And did she feed us with them?

468
00:32:44,162 --> 00:32:46,323
Yeah, course she did. I remember.

469
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:49,024
You can't remember
when you were a baby.

470
00:32:49,167 --> 00:32:52,728
I don't remember her doing it to me.
I remember her doing it to you.

471
00:32:55,273 --> 00:32:56,433
Anthony?

472
00:33:00,678 --> 00:33:02,145
What?

473
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,406
I thought you'd done the washing up?

474
00:33:03,548 --> 00:33:04,708
I did it!

475
00:33:04,849 --> 00:33:06,407
What do you call that glob?

476
00:33:26,871 --> 00:33:28,338
Hello what's your name?

477
00:33:28,473 --> 00:33:29,633
Keegan.

478
00:33:29,774 --> 00:33:32,538
Alright, K, what's happened
to your finger?

479
00:33:32,977 --> 00:33:36,538
That's quality.
Pure scary, pure scary.

480
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:40,511
Hey, give me your money.
Come on, empty your pockets.

481
00:33:40,651 --> 00:33:43,814
Hey you! Excuse me, excuse me!

482
00:33:43,955 --> 00:33:46,822
Give me all your money.
Come on, every copper.

483
00:33:51,162 --> 00:33:53,722
Who feels sorry
for poor children?

484
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:55,730
Correct answer.

485
00:33:56,768 --> 00:33:58,235
Everybody sitting up nicely?

486
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:01,529
Ok. So, as you know,

487
00:34:01,672 --> 00:34:03,833
we're going to have
new money in the New Year.

488
00:34:03,975 --> 00:34:08,639
Does anybody know how much
a euro is worth in pounds?

489
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:10,410
Yes.

490
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:13,517
- Sixty seven p.
- Spot on.

491
00:34:13,651 --> 00:34:15,209
Here, there's
a little prize for you.

492
00:34:15,353 --> 00:34:17,116
It's your own euro converter.

493
00:34:17,255 --> 00:34:19,519
Now! Who else wants one?
Anybody?

494
00:34:19,657 --> 00:34:22,023
- Me!
- Ohh. Everybody. Ok.

495
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:26,722
So, who can tell me how much
two pence is worth in euros?

496
00:34:28,766 --> 00:34:31,929
Mmm. Well I'll tell you.

497
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:36,636
It's worth not very much.
Almost nothing.

498
00:34:36,774 --> 00:34:38,139
To you.

499
00:34:38,276 --> 00:34:41,040
But if we all put our
two pences together.

500
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:43,306
Then we'll have a lot
of two pences won't we?

501
00:34:43,448 --> 00:34:44,813
Yes.

502
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:46,712
How many people are there here?

503
00:34:48,052 --> 00:34:51,818
One... two... three... four...

504
00:34:51,956 --> 00:34:55,619
Five... six... seven... eight...

505
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,523
Two hundred and fifty.

506
00:34:57,662 --> 00:34:58,321
Sorry?

507
00:34:58,463 --> 00:35:00,226
There's two hundred
and fifty in the school.

508
00:35:00,364 --> 00:35:02,525
Oh clever clogs head master.

509
00:35:02,967 --> 00:35:04,025
Ok two hundred and fifty.

510
00:35:04,168 --> 00:35:09,731
So if you each gave me two pence,
then I'd have five pounds.

511
00:35:09,874 --> 00:35:11,341
It's not that much here.

512
00:35:11,476 --> 00:35:15,537
But in Ethiopia five pounds
could feed a family for a week.

513
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:19,411
And if you all gave me two two pences,
then we'd have a tenner.

514
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:21,415
And that's enough
to provide that village

515
00:35:21,552 --> 00:35:24,316
with a source
of clean water forever.

516
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:27,515
It's no good to you.
So chuck it in the bin.

517
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:31,524
Excuse me.
Give me all your money!

518
00:35:31,662 --> 00:35:33,323
Come on, every copper.

519
00:35:34,866 --> 00:35:37,630
Get out of my way. Hey you!

520
00:35:38,369 --> 00:35:39,836
Hey, give me your money!

521
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:42,030
Come on. Empty your pockets.

522
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:47,944
Hello, what's your name?

523
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:48,943
Damian.

524
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,911
Hi Damian. I'm the Bin.

525
00:35:51,048 --> 00:35:52,208
Hello Bin.

526
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:55,012
Damian, you'll give me
some money won't you?

527
00:36:00,558 --> 00:36:01,525
Yeah.

528
00:36:17,074 --> 00:36:18,439
What did you do?

529
00:36:18,576 --> 00:36:19,736
You did it again didn't you?

530
00:36:19,877 --> 00:36:20,935
What?

531
00:36:21,078 --> 00:36:22,545
I saw what you did.

532
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:23,510
How much?

533
00:36:23,648 --> 00:36:26,014
Not much. She's nice.

534
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:27,208
I've been thinking.

535
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:28,818
Why don't we give the money to her?

536
00:36:28,953 --> 00:36:30,215
So how did it go?

537
00:36:30,354 --> 00:36:31,412
Well...

538
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:34,619
A thousand!

539
00:36:34,759 --> 00:36:37,421
What did you bring
a thousand to school for?

540
00:36:37,562 --> 00:36:38,927
Can't you see
that that's suspicious?

541
00:36:39,063 --> 00:36:42,521
It's not suspicious.
It's unusual.

542
00:36:42,667 --> 00:36:45,932
How can it be suspicious?
It's our money.

543
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:49,236
Right you lot outside...
come on.

544
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:50,840
Right, that's enough
messing around.

545
00:36:50,975 --> 00:36:51,942
Do you know in Africa

546
00:36:52,076 --> 00:36:55,045
you can build a well for
as little as a hundred pounds.

547
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,508
Just listen.

548
00:37:03,654 --> 00:37:06,714
It was the most daring,
most brilliant,

549
00:37:06,857 --> 00:37:10,418
cleverest and biggest robbery
on record, ever.

550
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:12,028
The train was here.

551
00:37:14,665 --> 00:37:16,724
The train,
the one with the money,

552
00:37:16,867 --> 00:37:18,027
Used notes.

553
00:37:18,169 --> 00:37:21,832
Right the van comes up
onto the platform... here.

554
00:37:22,273 --> 00:37:25,834
It's a railway van
so no one takes any notice.

555
00:37:26,777 --> 00:37:27,835
Until...

556
00:37:38,856 --> 00:37:40,016
They jump out of this van

557
00:37:40,157 --> 00:37:41,920
and some of them got hold
of the driver.

558
00:37:42,059 --> 00:37:43,924
Some of them start shifting the money.

559
00:37:45,162 --> 00:37:47,926
By this time rapid response
has been mobilised.

560
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:53,835
Alright, let's go. Come on!

561
00:38:07,752 --> 00:38:10,915
The van drives off with
a reckless disregard for life.

562
00:38:11,055 --> 00:38:12,920
Rapid response goes after it.

563
00:38:13,057 --> 00:38:16,117
There's... armed units.
Dog handlers. Helicopters.

564
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:17,921
Throw everything at them.

565
00:38:18,562 --> 00:38:19,927
The train stays here.

566
00:38:20,364 --> 00:38:23,424
An ambulance comes,
takes the driver to hospital.

567
00:38:23,567 --> 00:38:24,932
Get another driver.

568
00:38:25,069 --> 00:38:28,732
The CID count the bags.
There's only one missing.

569
00:38:28,873 --> 00:38:31,341
Then rapid response corner the van.

570
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:40,309
Trapped.

571
00:38:40,451 --> 00:38:43,215
The robbers dropped
the lot and they leg it!

572
00:38:43,554 --> 00:38:46,614
They've got no chance, except...

573
00:38:46,757 --> 00:38:50,818
Newcastle United versusArsenal
at Highbury.

574
00:38:50,961 --> 00:38:54,624
One all. Disappointing result
for the gunners.

575
00:38:55,566 --> 00:38:57,727
Please advise car,
I think we've lost them.

576
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:00,230
They don't catch the men.

577
00:39:00,371 --> 00:39:03,636
But that's alright
because when they get back to the van...

578
00:39:05,376 --> 00:39:06,843
there's the missing bag.

579
00:39:06,977 --> 00:39:08,842
How do you...
how do you know all that?

580
00:39:08,979 --> 00:39:10,606
His uncle works for the police.

581
00:39:10,748 --> 00:39:11,908
The van has gone.

582
00:39:12,049 --> 00:39:13,607
The train is in the station.

583
00:39:13,751 --> 00:39:16,413
And the cops are
in the cop shop making tea.

584
00:39:16,554 --> 00:39:18,215
Where are the robbers?

585
00:39:19,957 --> 00:39:22,824
Where's the last place
you're going to look?

586
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,326
- Our house?
- Maybe.

587
00:39:25,463 --> 00:39:29,422
So the train moves off
with a new driver and all the money.

588
00:39:29,567 --> 00:39:30,727
On the train.

589
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:33,336
The money was on the train
and so was a robber?

590
00:39:33,471 --> 00:39:35,029
Lateral thinking.

591
00:39:38,676 --> 00:39:42,134
The money stays on the train,
but so does a robber.

592
00:40:02,867 --> 00:40:03,731
He sits tight.

593
00:40:03,868 --> 00:40:06,336
And every time the train
comes to a slow bend

594
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:08,438
he chucks a sack of money out.

595
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:11,439
They've got people waiting
all over the country.

596
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:13,941
Could be Stafford or Crewe.

597
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:16,546
Could be Preston or Wigan.

598
00:40:16,647 --> 00:40:18,308
Runcorn, it could be.

599
00:40:19,049 --> 00:40:20,414
Could be here.

600
00:40:54,251 --> 00:40:55,309
Damian.

601
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:58,820
Damian. Calm down.
It'll be alright.

602
00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:00,116
No one knows it was us.

603
00:41:00,257 --> 00:41:03,624
I don't care. Leave me alone.
What you have to tell me for?

604
00:41:03,761 --> 00:41:06,229
Because I wanted you to know
the truth.

605
00:41:06,363 --> 00:41:08,126
We have to give it back.

606
00:41:08,265 --> 00:41:10,631
No... no we can't do that.

607
00:41:10,768 --> 00:41:12,030
They were going to burn it.

608
00:41:12,169 --> 00:41:15,627
Now come on, it isn't the money's
fault it got stolen.

609
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:19,136
- I thought it was from God.
- What?

610
00:41:19,276 --> 00:41:21,938
Well you know sometimes
you tell people about mam

611
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:24,206
and they give you money
or sweets.

612
00:41:24,348 --> 00:41:25,815
Well I told God and...

613
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:28,510
well who else would have
that kind of money?

614
00:41:28,953 --> 00:41:30,716
Well... in a funny...

615
00:41:30,855 --> 00:41:35,121
God doesn't rob banks, alright.
God does not rob banks.

616
00:41:39,864 --> 00:41:43,425
Office. Now.

617
00:41:44,568 --> 00:41:46,126
Your father's on his way.

618
00:41:54,378 --> 00:41:55,436
Come in.

619
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:01,212
The Mormons!

620
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:04,912
You stole money from mormons?

621
00:42:05,656 --> 00:42:08,318
Would you like to tell
us why you did it Anthony?
