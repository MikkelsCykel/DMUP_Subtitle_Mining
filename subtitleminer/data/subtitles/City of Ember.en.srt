00:00:22,773 --> 00:00:24,871
In the days around the world.

2
00:00:24,906 --> 00:00:29,541
The faith of humanity was taken
in a small box of metal.

3
00:00:39,177 --> 00:00:40,671
In a secret location.

4
00:00:40,706 --> 00:00:45,602
Architects, engineers and scientists
and concluded that there was only

5
00:00:45,637 --> 00:00:47,221
a hope for our future.

6
00:00:49,284 --> 00:00:51,400
Building a city under the ground.

7
00:00:51,435 --> 00:00:53,462
To keep the public
protected.

8
00:00:53,497 --> 00:00:55,188
For future generations.

9
00:01:07,494 --> 00:01:08,597
Custody.

10
00:01:10,105 --> 00:01:11,387
Programala for 200 years.

11
00:01:12,432 --> 00:01:14,535
For the city in 200 years.

12
00:01:17,332 --> 00:01:18,548
Você. will not live long.

13
00:01:19,115 --> 00:01:21,237
We can help.

14
00:01:21,585 --> 00:01:26,059
Growing up with the knowledge
from the outside world.

15
00:01:26,894 --> 00:01:33,412
Future generations
Will not suffer a loss.

16
00:01:36,664 --> 00:01:38,193
For the good of humanity.

17
00:01:45,072 --> 00:01:48,047
The box was entrusted to
first lady.

18
00:01:48,082 --> 00:01:50,176
What would happen to his successor.

19
00:01:57,746 --> 00:01:59,653
How to account for years
happening.

20
00:01:59,688 --> 00:02:02,478
The box went hand in hand.

21
00:02:03,204 --> 00:02:05,067
Without knowing the inside secrets.

22
00:02:05,554 --> 00:02:08,479
Just know you should
be open when the account expires.

23
00:02:12,269 --> 00:02:14,249
But it took another destination.

24
00:02:15,584 --> 00:02:17,625
The chain was broken.

25
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:30,162
The house was put aside and
forgotten.

26
00:02:31,022 --> 00:02:33,830
And when the city was
start the stopwatch.

27
00:02:33,865 --> 00:02:37,696
The box was opened.

28
00:03:26,202 --> 00:03:27,275
Hey, Dad hear that?

29
00:03:28,596 --> 00:03:30,846
Activity does not seem good.

30
00:03:30,881 --> 00:03:31,794
I hurry.

31
00:03:31,829 --> 00:03:34,120
This is a great day.

32
00:03:35,971 --> 00:03:40,194
I hope we do not have to
use this and not being able to control it.

33
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,670
You have a mission, this is not the point.

34
00:03:43,507 --> 00:03:45,393
What?

35
00:03:55,549 --> 00:04:00,512
6,7,8 ...

36
00:04:05,752 --> 00:04:06,401
Come.

37
00:04:07,424 --> 00:04:08,740
If so, this week.

38
00:04:09,841 --> 00:04:12,114
Producers have only
enough power.

39
00:04:12,694 --> 00:04:16,688
If he goes, let's all.

40
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:17,490
This is very bad.

41
00:04:17,525 --> 00:04:19,142
This place is in the park.

42
00:04:19,177 --> 00:04:22,685
I will not sit and wait
she collapses.

43
00:04:23,944 --> 00:04:25,831
Fixarei generator, costing
whatever the cost.

44
00:04:56,608 --> 00:04:57,915
Congratulations.

45
00:04:58,634 --> 00:05:01,337
At the time of this opportunity.

46
00:05:02,406 --> 00:05:03,776
His mission.

47
00:05:09,307 --> 00:05:10,144
Wait.

48
00:05:11,444 --> 00:05:12,981
His grandmother is right?

49
00:05:13,016 --> 00:05:14,019
Yes, we're fine.

50
00:05:14,054 --> 00:05:14,958
Okay Mr.

51
00:05:14,993 --> 00:05:15,772
If.

52
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:19,096
Hi

53
00:05:31,926 --> 00:05:32,817
Hello Mr miles.

56
00:05:40,191 --> 00:05:41,295

Declare gratitude to the buildings

00:06:10,663 --> 00:06:13,102
Flourish like flowers in the river.

61
00:06:13,137 --> 00:06:17,219
As we flew past
generations.

62
00:06:17,736 --> 00:06:20,410
Having a beautiful heart.

63
00:06:20,445 --> 00:06:24,751
In addition to temperament and forever
for the well-being.

64
00:06:24,786 --> 00:06:27,877
Our city to enjoy the
world.

65
00:06:30,243 --> 00:06:31,175
It is true.

66
00:06:56,821 --> 00:06:58,967
Be the first to discover
its future.

67
00:07:00,538 --> 00:07:02,336
Young forward.

68
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:08,481
Not out loud.

69
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,210
Assistant electricity.

70
00:07:12,965 --> 00:07:14,377
Work on the generator.

71
00:07:17,618 --> 00:07:18,970
Assistant to the lookout.

72
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:20,753
You need to work with the class.

73
00:07:24,672 --> 00:07:26,275
Constructor.

74
00:07:26,924 --> 00:07:28,125
It's fun.

75
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,973
Assistant store.

76
00:07:33,538 --> 00:07:34,529
Ok.

77
00:07:34,564 --> 00:07:35,492
Potato peeler.

78
00:07:35,527 --> 00:07:36,604
Coming from hand.

79
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:45,365
Domestic worker.

80
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,827
Vital work.

81
00:07:53,784 --> 00:07:55,166
Choose a young girl.

82
00:08:05,779 --> 00:08:08,713
Working in the pipes.

83
00:08:10,863 --> 00:08:12,159
Scream it so that everyone can hear.

84
00:08:14,905 --> 00:08:16,948
I am a slave of the pipes.

85
00:08:16,983 --> 00:08:20,439
You're very lucky girl
this is an important job.

86
00:08:20,474 --> 00:08:31,373
Servant.

87
00:08:31,408 --> 00:08:32,495
Take one.

88
00:08:46,555 --> 00:08:47,998
Messenger.

89
00:08:56,371 --> 00:08:59,028
Change.

90
00:09:00,094 --> 00:09:00,589
What?

91
00:09:00,624 --> 00:09:02,417
Please, you have to
to do.

92
00:09:02,452 --> 00:09:04,301
Want to work in the pipeline?

93
00:09:04,336 --> 00:09:06,821
I do not want to be assistant electric
and work on the generator

94
00:09:09,593 --> 00:09:11,468
I do not want to be a messenger;
I do not want to lose my time in

95
00:09:11,503 --> 00:09:12,392
throughout the city.

96
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:13,467
Yes

97
00:09:14,781 --> 00:09:15,296
What?

98
00:09:15,331 --> 00:09:16,163
If.

99
00:09:23,228 --> 00:09:23,923
Thank you.

00:09:40,038 --> 00:09:41,570
What was your mission?

102
00:09:41,605 --> 00:09:42,743
I am a messenger.

103
00:09:42,778 --> 00:09:45,038
That's wonderful.
Congratulations.

104
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:53,794
Grandma, Grandma.
Where is the money?

105
00:09:54,746 --> 00:09:55,912
I am a messenger.

106
00:09:57,547 --> 00:09:59,631
You should not do that.

107
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:01,848
There can be messengers.

108
00:10:01,883 --> 00:10:04,019
Today was the day of
award. Remember?

109
00:10:07,532 --> 00:10:08,577
Where is Popy?

110
00:10:11,341 --> 00:10:13,545
I was helping out.

111
00:10:15,976 --> 00:10:17,116
Here is the poppy.

112
00:10:20,734 --> 00:10:21,462
Poppy.

113
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:28,516
Poppy did not know where you were.

114
00:10:33,417 --> 00:10:35,075
Here.
It is for you.

115
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:46,314
I did.

116
00:10:47,231 --> 00:10:48,444
If I can see.

117
00:10:50,917 --> 00:10:52,179
What is this?

118
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:53,891
It is for their graduation.

119
00:10:54,841 --> 00:10:58,279
I mean to serve?

120
00:10:58,314 --> 00:10:59,586
Let's find out.

121
00:11:04,202 --> 00:11:07,007
There's more to stay the same
monitoring the bus.

122
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,793
The thing is ...

123
00:11:11,142 --> 00:11:12,482
Pay attention.

124
00:11:13,231 --> 00:11:14,957
Put a lot of attention.

125
00:11:14,992 --> 00:11:16,289
You'll see.

126
00:11:17,141 --> 00:11:18,660
What no one else will notice note.

127
00:11:20,187 --> 00:11:21,679
And no one else will know what we know.

128
00:11:23,018 --> 00:11:26,264
What do you get
All I have.

129
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:30,117
What do you do, what will be
get.

130
00:11:30,152 --> 00:11:31,966
This is a good starting point.

131
00:11:33,229 --> 00:11:34,112
When I said.

132
00:11:35,827 --> 00:11:36,525
The father is very useful.

133
00:11:42,029 --> 00:11:42,882
I did not want to eat?

134
00:11:44,241 --> 00:11:45,152
I am not hungry.

135
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:10,966
Sure.

136
00:12:12,085 --> 00:12:13,270
You're weak.

137
00:12:27,267 --> 00:12:27,971
Good night.

138
00:12:31,717 --> 00:12:34,133
I will put the voices for you
sleep ok.

139
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:54,196
No pressure or not.

140
00:12:55,182 --> 00:12:56,667
Be there before the sun comes out.

141
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:01,292
Sister shoes are ready.

142
00:13:02,469 --> 00:13:07,832
Hello I'm Ray Clare, the system
sparks fell again.

143
00:13:11,786 --> 00:13:13,648
Brent's me Hearl.

144
00:13:14,339 --> 00:13:15,316
'Take that.

145
00:13:16,652 --> 00:13:19,280
Take care of my children.

146
00:13:19,793 --> 00:13:22,328
In case you change your mind.

147
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:24,391
Sr.

148
00:13:27,963 --> 00:13:28,986
Where to go?

149
00:14:19,178 --> 00:14:21,214
Lina presenting Mayfleet
for work.

150
00:14:25,089 --> 00:14:26,570
You are a Mayfleet.

151
00:14:28,156 --> 00:14:30,177
In other words, please.

152
00:14:56,142 --> 00:14:57,294
8 hours.

153
00:14:57,717 --> 00:14:58,710
Go all.

154
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:17,361
It is beautiful.

155
00:15:17,931 --> 00:15:20,548
Take it with pride.
Take care.

156
00:15:21,775 --> 00:15:23,248
Always keep in place a
appropriate

157
00:15:23,283 --> 00:15:24,107
I will.

158
00:15:26,645 --> 00:15:27,900
The session will be on the block.

159
00:15:28,789 --> 00:15:29,335
Stop.

160
00:15:32,748 --> 00:15:34,064
I need to tell you the rules.

161
00:15:35,251 --> 00:15:36,887
1. When a customer ...

162
00:15:36,922 --> 00:15:38,568
Leave a message
doing good.

163
00:15:38,603 --> 00:15:41,782
2. Always read the red letters
so people can sign.

164
00:15:41,817 --> 00:15:46,290
3. Our customers pay 25 cents
for each message no matter how far he is.

165
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:47,700
And go quickly.

166
00:15:49,226 --> 00:15:50,105
I go fast.

167
00:15:50,569 --> 00:15:52,989
Okay, I'm impressed.

168
00:15:53,397 --> 00:15:53,969
Now go.

169
00:16:04,308 --> 00:16:05,833
That over your clothes you wear.

170
00:16:06,643 --> 00:16:08,665
Here are all the tools
you need.

171
00:16:10,687 --> 00:16:12,732
I think the attraction --
these boots are fine.

172
00:16:13,599 --> 00:16:15,256
Need for traction
this.

173
00:16:17,124 --> 00:16:18,839
And this is their home.

174
00:16:19,368 --> 00:16:20,653
Put your shoes and come.

175
00:16:22,137 --> 00:16:22,705
Very good.

176
00:16:30,961 --> 00:16:32,101
You have a rockcod.

177
00:16:34,561 --> 00:16:35,269
This.

178
00:16:36,873 --> 00:16:37,748
What you have left.

179
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,578
All right, put your name on it.

180
00:16:42,153 --> 00:16:42,854
Why?

181
00:16:43,374 --> 00:16:43,999
Why?

182
00:16:44,857 --> 00:16:46,092
In the event that something happens.

183
00:16:47,426 --> 00:16:49,687
Before you dive
to put your name on it

184
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:53,073
to find out who he was.

185
00:16:56,693 --> 00:16:57,569
Use this.

186
00:17:04,873 --> 00:17:08,580
I think I know who is
wrong with the generator.

187
00:17:11,555 --> 00:17:12,110
Well

188
00:17:12,145 --> 00:17:13,081
Made.

189
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:17,158
Sister

190
00:17:28,751 --> 00:17:29,606
20 cents please.

191
00:17:41,046 --> 00:17:41,541
Slowly.

192
00:17:50,744 --> 00:17:51,409
Hey.

193
00:17:54,894 --> 00:17:55,403
I am.

194
00:17:55,989 --> 00:17:57,119
Look at you.

195
00:17:58,073 --> 00:17:59,270
I was told.

196
00:17:59,305 --> 00:18:00,362
Why you is my first message.

197
00:18:00,397 --> 00:18:02,908
Wait, I'm ready.

198
00:18:02,943 --> 00:18:04,465
Weapons of SWERA
plant.

199
00:18:09,438 --> 00:18:13,223
If this is a potatoes, then
I am 16 and I'm sexy.

200
00:18:19,496 --> 00:18:20,433
Help!

201
00:18:38,459 --> 00:18:39,694
I have one thing in my hand.

202
00:18:42,655 --> 00:18:44,756
I can see.

203
00:18:45,558 --> 00:18:48,425
It is larger than a house.

204
00:18:49,784 --> 00:18:52,322
Just trying to go along
the river.

205
00:18:52,357 --> 00:18:53,532
Sister

206
00:18:55,087 --> 00:18:59,665
A belt of things up by
feet.

207
00:19:03,261 --> 00:19:08,077
Pc. I do not know what
idea how she was.

208
00:19:15,015 --> 00:19:17,011
Why would someone want arriezgaría
in jail.

209
00:19:18,056 --> 00:19:20,749
Everybody knows that
take much to get out of there.

210
00:19:22,134 --> 00:19:25,044
There is much further to
that the world there.

211
00:19:28,057 --> 00:19:34,097
His father was the only one they arranged
potatoes.

212
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,788
Deeply sorry.

213
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:53,541
Keep it up.

214
00:19:55,565 --> 00:19:56,365
Help me with this.

215
00:19:57,539 --> 00:19:58,580
We need to make a new plan.

216
00:19:59,892 --> 00:20:00,878
Are you new plan?

217
00:20:02,268 --> 00:20:06,418
We do not make new plans
since the second decade.

218
00:20:09,693 --> 00:20:11,575
Pudes patch well.

219
00:20:12,381 --> 00:20:12,967
Hold.

220
00:20:20,361 --> 00:20:21,278
Review it.

221
00:20:23,349 --> 00:20:23,937
What was it?

222
00:20:30,205 --> 00:20:31,070
Is warming up?

223
00:20:31,938 --> 00:20:32,459
This measure.

224
00:20:33,986 --> 00:20:34,708
Far.

225
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:37,480
Absent is not good.

226
00:20:42,253 --> 00:20:43,201
What will happen?

227
00:20:43,694 --> 00:20:44,255
The same as usual.

228
00:20:44,551 --> 00:20:45,217
What is this?

229
00:20:45,252 --> 00:20:46,082
The frost.

230
00:20:46,117 --> 00:20:47,581
What about the black box
they can ...

231
00:20:47,616 --> 00:20:48,587
Calm down.

232
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:51,426
Take that much lower.

233
00:20:57,730 --> 00:20:59,008
What is the name of this tunnel?

234
00:21:00,816 --> 00:21:02,124
The tunnel is 25.

235
00:21:02,702 --> 00:21:04,087
And this is 26.

236
00:21:04,663 --> 00:21:05,737
How do you know?

237
00:21:11,121 --> 00:21:11,795
Come on.

238
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:18,036
Low.

239
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:19,653
What do we have?

240
00:21:21,325 --> 00:21:21,870
And this ...

241
00:21:23,358 --> 00:21:25,876
One moment, that's not my
work.

242
00:21:26,289 --> 00:21:28,780
They were eternally.
And not know it.

243
00:21:29,726 --> 00:21:35,203
I was too
busy.

244
00:21:35,238 --> 00:21:36,936
We can go to the generator?

245
00:22:22,226 --> 00:22:23,543
I already have enough for the generator.

246
00:23:04,254 --> 00:23:06,130
This tunnel would be.

247
00:24:45,262 --> 00:24:46,937
What are you doing here?

248
00:24:48,082 --> 00:24:49,389
I work in this part.

249
00:24:50,384 --> 00:24:53,454
I know you, your brother
is in my class.

250
00:24:55,229 --> 00:24:56,801
Thanks for the information.

251
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,127
So why are you here?

252
00:24:58,162 --> 00:24:59,405
No, I'm coaching.

253
00:25:00,124 --> 00:25:01,775
And I'm sorry you lost.

254
00:25:03,952 --> 00:25:06,149
Get out of here.

255
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:08,993
You okay?

256
00:25:53,715 --> 00:25:54,491
Whats up

257
00:25:57,872 --> 00:25:58,162
Come on.

258
00:25:58,197 --> 00:25:59,582
Please.

259
00:25:59,617 --> 00:26:00,972
Come on.

260
00:26:06,002 --> 00:26:06,721
Where are you?

261
00:26:09,108 --> 00:26:09,828
You okay?

262
00:26:10,508 --> 00:26:11,443
You okay?

263
00:26:12,015 --> 00:26:12,559
If.

264
00:26:14,855 --> 00:26:15,632
Something is happening.

265
00:26:24,545 --> 00:26:25,069
What was that sound?

266
00:26:25,104 --> 00:26:26,395
It is the generator.

267
00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:27,472
You can solve the case.

268
00:26:27,507 --> 00:26:28,524
Maybe sooner.

269
00:26:29,022 --> 00:26:29,920
No time.

270
00:26:30,942 --> 00:26:31,903
We must do something.

271
00:26:34,208 --> 00:26:37,128
There was a man this morning
From then returned.

272
00:26:37,163 --> 00:26:38,341
He said he heard something.

273
00:26:39,686 --> 00:26:41,389
Did you ever think you had
an exit?

274
00:26:43,284 --> 00:26:43,961
I have an idea.

275
00:26:48,578 --> 00:26:50,466
Attention to all workers.

276
00:26:51,796 --> 00:26:53,385
I need to get to the bottom.

277
00:26:54,924 --> 00:26:55,774
Stay safe, OK.

278
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:57,385
Doon.

279
00:26:58,724 --> 00:26:59,743
Wait.

280
00:27:02,661 --> 00:27:03,543
Forget it.

281
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:06,430
I think I came to this.

282
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,131
Why is that?

283
00:27:08,751 --> 00:27:09,859
I came back from that.

284
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:11,550
Not so.

285
00:27:12,874 --> 00:27:15,196
Can I keep it?

286
00:27:18,169 --> 00:27:20,488
Mrs. I go home and review
to my friends.

287
00:27:20,709 --> 00:27:21,822
We have to go.

288
00:27:22,383 --> 00:27:23,396
Tell everyone.

289
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:33,495
We like 7 minutes.

290
00:27:35,243 --> 00:27:37,516
In parts as ever.

291
00:27:47,774 --> 00:27:48,563
Grandmother.

292
00:28:31,001 --> 00:28:32,288
There is something I have to do.

293
00:28:33,497 --> 00:28:36,165
It is very important.

294
00:28:37,994 --> 00:28:41,385
My great-grandfather, told me that ....

295
00:28:42,313 --> 00:28:42,853
Sorry.

296
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:45,386
No.

297
00:28:46,761 --> 00:28:47,723
Spit it out.

298
00:28:56,641 --> 00:28:57,987
Ruining the furniture grandmother.

299
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,582
She found him.

300
00:29:05,908 --> 00:29:07,037
Is this was what I want?

301
00:29:08,649 --> 00:29:09,276
Are you sure?

302
00:29:12,672 --> 00:29:13,540
These are special?

303
00:29:17,034 --> 00:29:18,556
I do not care.

304
00:29:19,668 --> 00:29:20,757
All right.

305
00:29:24,556 --> 00:29:25,566
Remember.

306
00:29:28,868 --> 00:29:30,635
Grandma I have to go back to work.

307
00:29:31,236 --> 00:29:31,894
Ok.

308
00:29:49,574 --> 00:29:50,509
No more questions.

309
00:29:51,203 --> 00:29:52,134
The generator is broken.

310
00:29:54,733 --> 00:29:55,289
Thank you very much.

311
00:29:55,668 --> 00:29:56,530
I have a message.

312
00:29:57,595 --> 00:29:58,576
For Shna silly.

313
00:29:59,349 --> 00:30:00,776
Oh, I am, what happened?

314
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:02,610
Maltor send it.

315
00:30:02,645 --> 00:30:03,527
Did he do?

316
00:30:03,562 --> 00:30:06,069
The wanted to tell you that no
can come for lunch today.

317
00:30:07,273 --> 00:30:11,628
He says his house is far
for him and he is very tired.

318
00:30:21,212 --> 00:30:24,858
A message for the mayor.

319
00:30:28,043 --> 00:30:29,900
Its interior is sheep.

320
00:30:46,542 --> 00:30:47,534
Morning messenger.

321
00:30:48,907 --> 00:30:50,353
What brings you here?

322
00:30:53,218 --> 00:30:54,375
I have a message for the mayor.

323
00:30:54,988 --> 00:30:55,577
Very good.

324
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:02,088
This way please.

325
00:31:07,003 --> 00:31:09,641
These paintings are all
Mayors in the empire.

326
00:31:11,342 --> 00:31:12,454
Seventh is the mayor of hot.

327
00:31:12,455 --> 00:31:13,455
I am a relative of him.

328
00:31:13,456 --> 00:31:19,761
He is my Biza Biza ... I do not know
It was in that range.

329
00:31:19,796 --> 00:31:22,336
It is the 7th mayor.

330
00:31:24,298 --> 00:31:26,082
Continues to live in
same place as he did.

331
00:31:43,901 --> 00:31:44,548
Passage.

332
00:31:55,145 --> 00:31:57,307
I remember the days of release.

333
00:31:58,442 --> 00:32:01,222
She is a descendant of our
The 7th mayor.

334
00:32:02,021 --> 00:32:02,682
Really?

335
00:32:05,704 --> 00:32:06,255
Lina Mayflead.

336
00:32:10,643 --> 00:32:12,941
This is a name for a messenger.

337
00:32:15,888 --> 00:32:17,398
Can you see your feet?

338
00:32:25,054 --> 00:32:27,250
I see you got the job.

339
00:32:27,766 --> 00:32:28,684
What is the message?

340
00:32:31,004 --> 00:32:32,070
It was Mr. Loop.

341
00:32:44,981 --> 00:32:47,015
His sheep is complete.

342
00:32:49,883 --> 00:32:50,614
Thank you.

343
00:32:56,995 --> 00:32:59,469
What are these boxes on
Mr portraits.

344
00:33:01,199 --> 00:33:02,249
It is part of the message?

345
00:33:02,628 --> 00:33:03,379
No.

346
00:33:03,414 --> 00:33:04,929
I was just curious.

347
00:33:05,794 --> 00:33:06,370
Thank you.

348
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:13,834
That's right.

349
00:33:13,869 --> 00:33:15,339
Keep it up.

350
00:33:16,767 --> 00:33:18,729
And will continue for the blind.

351
00:33:23,033 --> 00:33:24,515
What is this?

352
00:33:25,704 --> 00:33:29,316
Cover small ears
I said back.

353
00:33:30,361 --> 00:33:31,533
And for good returns.

354
00:33:34,648 --> 00:33:35,897
Delivered the message.

355
00:33:38,401 --> 00:33:39,732
We were here for a long time.

356
00:33:41,475 --> 00:33:43,345
I can see that.

357
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:46,228
The generator had not failed
this year.

358
00:33:47,132 --> 00:33:48,930
The latter is a separate generator.

359
00:33:50,424 --> 00:33:51,680
And nobody knows that back.

360
00:33:53,439 --> 00:33:56,676
What can you do?

361
00:34:00,161 --> 00:34:02,410
What can you do
about it?

362
00:34:14,838 --> 00:34:17,253
How can you explain this?

363
00:34:22,389 --> 00:34:24,102
Will you give me a headache.

364
00:34:55,209 --> 00:34:56,104
Brasa.

365
00:34:58,304 --> 00:34:59,067
time ...

366
00:35:02,361 --> 00:35:04,911
Support of life ...

367
00:35:11,008 --> 00:35:13,170
1. It should ...

368
00:35:14,613 --> 00:35:15,692
2. Unlocking ...

369
00:35:38,155 --> 00:35:39,421
It is very beautiful.

370
00:35:40,835 --> 00:35:44,047
Give me 20 packages.

371
00:35:46,543 --> 00:35:48,262
Or you can give me 15.

372
00:35:49,515 --> 00:35:51,477
You can not have just 15
3.

373
00:35:52,416 --> 00:35:53,113
Do not tell me that.

374
00:35:53,654 --> 00:35:55,138
Yesterday I had several on the market.

375
00:35:55,896 --> 00:35:57,071
But not today.

376
00:35:57,725 --> 00:35:58,364
I do not understand the funny.

377
00:35:58,399 --> 00:36:00,112
Do this and ask who has

378
00:36:00,954 --> 00:36:01,623
Next.

379
00:36:11,707 --> 00:36:13,651
I have to find.

380
00:36:15,525 --> 00:36:16,977
You need to stay in bed.

381
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:18,465
I found grandmother.

382
00:36:20,850 --> 00:36:21,729
Thank you.

383
00:36:24,147 --> 00:36:24,810
What is this?

384
00:36:25,874 --> 00:36:26,603
I told her what?

385
00:36:27,085 --> 00:36:28,767
For now we talk enough.

386
00:36:29,623 --> 00:36:32,227
Você. should be asleep.

387
00:36:33,776 --> 00:36:35,357
There is no medicine that can give you?

388
00:36:36,186 --> 00:36:38,746
There is no cure, sorry.

389
00:36:40,177 --> 00:36:41,925
And I gave everything I could.

390
00:36:45,736 --> 00:36:46,998
Can you help me with that.

391
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:48,862
Let's see.

392
00:36:53,033 --> 00:36:54,441
Stay tuned.

393
00:36:55,244 --> 00:36:55,975
Do not bite.

394
00:36:58,749 --> 00:36:59,709
What did he do it indoors?

395
00:37:14,898 --> 00:37:17,412
Poppy endpoint.

396
00:37:21,124 --> 00:37:23,272
It is only the light, do not worry.

397
00:37:27,199 --> 00:37:27,792
Ok.

398
00:37:33,651 --> 00:37:35,585
Grandma, here we go.

399
00:37:38,705 --> 00:37:39,733
Grandmother.

400
00:37:59,706 --> 00:38:02,910
You have to share this with Poppy, but
I think it's big enough.

401
00:38:05,652 --> 00:38:09,176
¿Poppy is what makes it work
The system generator?

402
00:38:20,064 --> 00:38:21,087
You know your side.

403
00:38:24,706 --> 00:38:28,216
I think dealing with it
last year.

404
00:38:28,991 --> 00:38:31,244
Oh, well, singing is very important.

405
00:38:32,584 --> 00:38:34,052
We are happy heart.

406
00:38:34,766 --> 00:38:35,921
We are fortunate.

407
00:38:37,602 --> 00:38:39,301
I do not feel very lucky
lately.

408
00:38:40,992 --> 00:38:42,776
There is nothing to worry about
that's why.

409
00:38:42,811 --> 00:38:44,579
Blackouts concern us
for all.

410
00:38:44,614 --> 00:38:46,121
The aid will arrive.

411
00:38:48,134 --> 00:38:48,833
Help?

412
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:51,389
Who build the city
dear.

413
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:53,696
Manufacturers.

414
00:38:53,731 --> 00:38:54,501
That's right.

415
00:38:55,546 --> 00:38:58,441
The manufacturer will come again
and fix it.

416
00:39:09,823 --> 00:39:11,140
Whatever it is a grandmother.

417
00:39:11,917 --> 00:39:12,701
Let's find out.

418
00:39:14,628 --> 00:39:15,421
I promise.

419
00:39:34,651 --> 00:39:35,561
These are roles.

420
00:39:35,596 --> 00:39:36,946
That's why you the fact.

421
00:39:37,732 --> 00:39:38,273
This is ...

422
00:39:40,453 --> 00:39:41,335
Nobody remembers him.

423
00:39:43,184 --> 00:39:43,998
Come on, I do.

424
00:39:51,210 --> 00:39:51,994
What are we doing here?

425
00:39:52,951 --> 00:39:54,197
The builders something left.

426
00:39:54,232 --> 00:39:55,623
Maybe what we find.

427
00:40:08,291 --> 00:40:09,014
Come on, open it.

428
00:40:12,203 --> 00:40:14,690
It is not supposed to be.

429
00:40:29,005 --> 00:40:30,028
Elder wrote these instructions.

430
00:40:30,063 --> 00:40:32,157
They sound like them.

431
00:41:01,429 --> 00:41:02,661
Come on.

432
00:41:03,349 --> 00:41:04,221
We must show

433
00:41:06,977 --> 00:41:08,169
What do you think?

434
00:41:09,989 --> 00:41:11,087
I think they are instructions.

435
00:41:11,581 --> 00:41:13,300
If.

436
00:41:13,335 --> 00:41:16,013
Whatever it is, why he had
in a circle?

437
00:41:16,628 --> 00:41:18,102
I mean, I know ...

438
00:41:18,137 --> 00:41:19,301
That's it.

439
00:41:19,881 --> 00:41:20,784
IT.

440
00:41:21,703 --> 00:41:23,523
What?

441
00:41:23,558 --> 00:41:23,884
IT ... exit.

442
00:41:23,919 --> 00:41:25,357
Looks run it.

443
00:41:33,304 --> 00:41:35,342
I do not think it was supposed to have
to leave here.

444
00:41:36,466 --> 00:41:38,113
These tunnels do not appear on the map.

445
00:41:39,370 --> 00:41:40,761
They are like roads to nowhere.

446
00:41:44,961 --> 00:41:45,935
That may be.

447
00:42:25,034 --> 00:42:25,612
What was that?

448
00:42:27,145 --> 00:42:29,112
I do not know.

449
00:43:13,847 --> 00:43:14,531
Run.

450
00:43:17,113 --> 00:43:18,462
Wait, here.

451
00:43:20,477 --> 00:43:21,361
Come on.

452
00:43:26,613 --> 00:43:29,019
Run, run.

453
00:44:30,555 --> 00:44:31,771
It is the only chance.

454
00:44:41,587 --> 00:44:43,398
Thanks for another great idea.

455
00:44:43,433 --> 00:44:45,045
You never her alive.

456
00:44:45,859 --> 00:44:47,519
Hunger is just der suddenly
like us.

457
00:44:55,175 --> 00:44:55,984
After these tunnels.

458
00:44:57,198 --> 00:44:58,782
Completely lacking complete.

459
00:45:03,687 --> 00:45:06,774
No problem, the generator
will not work.

460
00:45:07,573 --> 00:45:09,255
Very soon will be black
for the better.

461
00:45:16,371 --> 00:45:17,529
This is my name.

462
00:45:18,152 --> 00:45:20,561
He was the man I was before
who drowned.

463
00:45:24,234 --> 00:45:25,026
Ahorgar.

464
00:45:28,489 --> 00:45:29,314
Strange.

465
00:45:30,579 --> 00:45:32,264
There is no water for irrigation.

466
00:45:35,163 --> 00:45:36,403
How could ahorgar?

467
00:45:39,827 --> 00:45:40,608
Why?

468
00:45:47,065 --> 00:45:50,293
we must find out
this is the only thing left us.

469
00:45:50,870 --> 00:45:53,047
This is what scares me most.

470
00:45:55,537 --> 00:45:56,690
Do not count anything.

471
00:46:00,286 --> 00:46:01,886
It's like not understand.

472
00:46:02,802 --> 00:46:03,962
Please, dear.

473
00:46:05,367 --> 00:46:06,933
Do not do anything stupid.

474
00:46:08,221 --> 00:46:09,768
Something like this is bad.

475
00:46:10,795 --> 00:46:11,815
How did she die?

476
00:46:15,765 --> 00:46:16,768
Do we really drowned?

477
00:46:31,633 --> 00:46:33,429
His father thought I
could.

478
00:46:34,931 --> 00:46:37,603
He believed that there was a way out.

479
00:46:38,819 --> 00:46:40,185
I could not dissuade him.

480
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:44,525
I said I was better than us
stay and fix our problems.

481
00:46:45,259 --> 00:46:47,627
But it is illegal to enter the unknown.

482
00:46:48,212 --> 00:46:49,030
Why is it illegal?

483
00:46:55,532 --> 00:46:59,663
His father said: The river flows in one direction.

484
00:46:59,698 --> 00:47:02,805
So he has to come from somewhere.

485
00:47:04,614 --> 00:47:08,050
But you have to hit early
something.

486
00:47:08,085 --> 00:47:09,234
I do not know.

487
00:47:09,924 --> 00:47:11,052
The tunnel buoy.

488
00:47:12,019 --> 00:47:12,802
End.

489
00:47:14,328 --> 00:47:16,531
Yes, my father died.

490
00:47:20,485 --> 00:47:22,308
He was alone.

491
00:47:22,343 --> 00:47:25,318
All others came before
that clutter.

492
00:47:34,675 --> 00:47:36,938
We have to consider bringing
cash to the mayor.

493
00:47:38,084 --> 00:47:38,799
Yes

494
00:47:39,411 --> 00:47:41,107
What now, please.

495
00:47:41,928 --> 00:47:43,584
Who knows the situation.

496
00:47:49,609 --> 00:47:51,386
It is a time of trouble.

497
00:47:52,778 --> 00:47:55,771
Our problems are brave.

498
00:47:58,030 --> 00:47:59,178
We need answers.

499
00:48:00,233 --> 00:48:01,601
But beyond the answers.

500
00:48:02,337 --> 00:48:04,007
More important than the answers.

501
00:48:06,191 --> 00:48:07,797
We need solutions.

502
00:48:10,407 --> 00:48:12,515
And to find such solutions.

503
00:48:15,823 --> 00:48:19,984
I think there should be a
investigation.

504
00:48:21,672 --> 00:48:22,823
I am here to testify.

505
00:48:23,558 --> 00:48:26,375
The creation of the force
work.

506
00:48:26,928 --> 00:48:28,365
To do research
the black box.

507
00:48:34,042 --> 00:48:36,641
There are some volunteers?

508
00:48:40,590 --> 00:48:44,597
Today we, the people.

509
00:48:45,313 --> 00:48:47,728
We are united against them.

510
00:49:12,358 --> 00:49:12,938
Give me that.

511
00:49:14,691 --> 00:49:15,361
Sr.

512
00:49:17,082 --> 00:49:17,773
Let him.

513
00:49:25,909 --> 00:49:26,596
Pineapple.

514
00:49:27,721 --> 00:49:30,310
Pineapple, not since my
Grandma was a girl.

515
00:49:30,345 --> 00:49:31,364
Where did you get that?

516
00:49:34,909 --> 00:49:36,041
Where did you get this food?

517
00:49:41,808 --> 00:49:44,596
I gave a lover.

518
00:49:45,095 --> 00:49:46,303
You do not have a lover.

519
00:49:46,338 --> 00:49:47,329
It is not official.

520
00:49:47,364 --> 00:49:49,853
But this guy really liked him.

521
00:49:49,888 --> 00:49:51,144
Explore a lot.

522
00:49:51,896 --> 00:49:53,086
Especially by alla.

523
00:49:53,770 --> 00:49:56,138
Are empty, but you want to
are not empty.

524
00:49:57,026 --> 00:49:58,662
And give me something from time to time.

525
00:50:02,011 --> 00:50:03,202
You are wrong.

526
00:50:03,606 --> 00:50:06,781
All this will get worse,
Why not enjoy it now?

527
00:50:08,806 --> 00:50:09,516
There it is.

528
00:50:36,801 --> 00:50:37,714
I need to tell you something.

529
00:50:37,749 --> 00:50:39,655
I was looking for 351
to the north.

530
00:50:39,690 --> 00:50:42,248
Before he had a message.

531
00:50:45,213 --> 00:50:47,088
All you have to do
the door is open.

532
00:51:09,422 --> 00:51:10,604
There's a lot of food.

533
00:51:55,433 --> 00:51:57,736
I thought I was lying to find
a solution.

534
00:51:58,729 --> 00:51:59,994
He should lie.

535
00:52:00,029 --> 00:52:01,463
Found the solution.

536
00:52:02,659 --> 00:52:04,262
Sit well.

537
00:52:05,152 --> 00:52:06,125
Go to sleep.

538
00:52:07,338 --> 00:52:08,681
Stay there.

539
00:52:10,030 --> 00:52:10,722
What is this?

540
00:52:12,289 --> 00:52:15,944
It is an answering machine is left
my parents.

541
00:52:16,230 --> 00:52:17,323
Before that happened.

542
00:52:22,192 --> 00:52:22,853
Anybody home?

543
00:52:24,491 --> 00:52:26,257
Do not let my dear.

544
00:52:27,230 --> 00:52:28,061
This is the voice of my father.

545
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:32,033
Bren's me.

546
00:52:33,573 --> 00:52:35,075
Take care of my son.

547
00:52:43,721 --> 00:52:44,442
I am inside.

548
00:52:44,477 --> 00:52:45,950
What happens?

549
00:52:50,204 --> 00:52:51,675
I lied.

550
00:52:53,152 --> 00:52:53,789
Where are you going?

551
00:52:56,014 --> 00:52:57,864
See you in the green house ok.

552
00:52:58,467 --> 00:52:59,382
Good night young people.

553
00:53:02,939 --> 00:53:07,666
What progress?
For the song.

554
00:53:09,709 --> 00:53:12,049
Oh, good.

555
00:53:12,084 --> 00:53:13,359
It is very good.

556
00:53:14,241 --> 00:53:14,840
Well

557
00:53:15,984 --> 00:53:16,649
Good night.

558
00:53:16,684 --> 00:53:17,198
Good night.

559
00:53:21,689 --> 00:53:24,349
Dad, did you hear.

560
00:53:24,384 --> 00:53:28,065
I heard that the response
this is so.

561
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:29,512
Apparently, it is an answering machine.

562
00:53:30,205 --> 00:53:32,625
I hear you, you said you were made
to enter.

563
00:53:37,041 --> 00:53:39,332
You do not think the city?

564
00:53:41,316 --> 00:53:42,682
Why is that?

565
00:53:44,246 --> 00:53:45,085
For me.

566
00:53:55,036 --> 00:53:55,715
Dad.

567
00:53:56,826 --> 00:53:57,380
Please.

568
00:54:00,992 --> 00:54:02,026
I was wrong.

569
00:54:02,061 --> 00:54:03,215
No, you were right.

570
00:54:04,028 --> 00:54:05,459
There is an exit.

571
00:54:05,890 --> 00:54:07,393
If, of course not.

572
00:54:07,428 --> 00:54:09,082
I have someone who murirera.

573
00:54:09,616 --> 00:54:11,180
Dad is a departure in
roles.

574
00:54:11,215 --> 00:54:13,185
And you have to tell me, what you know.

575
00:54:14,324 --> 00:54:15,173
I do not know anything.

576
00:54:15,605 --> 00:54:16,389
Nothing for you.

577
00:54:18,435 --> 00:54:20,130
The manufacturer has left instructions.

578
00:54:20,663 --> 00:54:22,492
The manufacturer has nothing to do with
this.

579
00:54:22,527 --> 00:54:23,717
Yes, I did.

580
00:54:23,752 --> 00:54:25,150
They did, I do not have evidence.

581
00:54:29,737 --> 00:54:30,694
Shows them to me.

582
00:54:38,262 --> 00:54:40,696
The great days of singing

583
00:54:47,778 --> 00:54:48,500
Hold on.

584
00:54:50,746 --> 00:54:52,345
Happy days of singing young lady.

585
00:54:53,289 --> 00:54:54,466
I need to talk in private.

586
00:54:55,559 --> 00:54:56,241
Very good.

587
00:54:58,106 --> 00:55:00,936
What do I need to tell you is
secret and very important.

588
00:55:01,646 --> 00:55:02,200
What is this?

589
00:55:02,235 --> 00:55:05,546
The mayor has a box in the depths
full of food.

590
00:55:08,766 --> 00:55:10,749
I am sure that they are willing to
the worst.

591
00:55:13,838 --> 00:55:15,692
Does the mayor steals?

592
00:55:16,928 --> 00:55:19,255
You are going to the shops and so on.

593
00:55:22,765 --> 00:55:24,447
That is shocking.

594
00:55:25,650 --> 00:55:26,238
Shocking.

595
00:55:28,169 --> 00:55:29,876
I am in Chock.

596
00:55:32,593 --> 00:55:34,545
We have to bring it.

597
00:55:35,548 --> 00:55:36,179
Come with me.

598
00:55:36,727 --> 00:55:41,064
When we arrested
to go and where is the room.

599
00:55:41,645 --> 00:55:42,571
You expect to where we going?

600
00:56:06,427 --> 00:56:08,120
Take your part Honor.

601
00:56:08,728 --> 00:56:10,045
Lina Mayfleet Do you remember?

602
00:56:10,804 --> 00:56:13,005
She is accusing.

603
00:56:16,469 --> 00:56:17,283
From what?

604
00:56:17,826 --> 00:56:20,345
Stealing food for the people of fire.

605
00:56:22,295 --> 00:56:27,104
I bought a whole and within each house.

606
00:56:31,980 --> 00:56:33,532
I do not know why you think such a thing.

607
00:56:33,983 --> 00:56:35,777
We saw his room, we saw
inside.

608
00:56:37,149 --> 00:56:37,661
Nós.

609
00:56:38,008 --> 00:56:39,398
She and her friend Doon Harrow.

610
00:56:44,612 --> 00:56:45,985
What the box?

611
00:56:49,278 --> 00:56:49,883
It's mine.

612
00:56:54,267 --> 00:56:55,523
It is a bit unusual.

613
00:56:57,099 --> 00:56:58,185
Where did you get it?

614
00:57:03,052 --> 00:57:04,871
You are a descendant of one of the mayors.

615
00:57:04,906 --> 00:57:05,876
Yes, sir.

616
00:57:05,911 --> 00:57:09,107
She is the 7th Mayor's family.

617
00:57:14,924 --> 00:57:19,585
Things sometimes get lost.

618
00:57:19,620 --> 00:57:21,206
Can I look at this box?

619
00:57:21,241 --> 00:57:22,896
Why?

620
00:57:22,931 --> 00:57:24,139
What is inside the box?

621
00:57:25,253 --> 00:57:27,733
I think it's a matter of the mayor.

622
00:57:30,917 --> 00:57:32,169
The house, give me.

623
00:57:33,711 --> 00:57:34,447
It is not theirs.

624
00:57:34,985 --> 00:57:35,533
Give me the box!

625
00:57:35,568 --> 00:57:36,367
No.

626
00:57:36,402 --> 00:57:37,310
Remove it.

627
00:57:37,345 --> 00:57:38,202
Now.

628
00:57:39,875 --> 00:57:41,117
Move it.

629
00:58:06,979 --> 00:58:07,780
Him.

630
00:58:20,884 --> 00:58:21,467
Him.

631
00:58:46,775 --> 00:58:47,674
Be quiet.

632
00:58:47,709 --> 00:58:49,410
You want to be here?

633
00:58:49,445 --> 00:58:51,114
I can not hear, I have a bad ear.

634
00:58:51,149 --> 00:58:52,158
You can talk ...

635
00:58:52,193 --> 00:58:53,252
Harrow destination.

636
00:58:53,287 --> 00:58:55,019
We are looking for Destiny Harrow.

637
00:58:55,054 --> 00:58:55,740
It's bad.

638
00:58:55,775 --> 00:58:58,170
And that is not cursed my son.

639
00:58:58,992 --> 00:59:01,085
The prison is the worst place
where you can go.

640
00:59:01,827 --> 00:59:03,676
The builders were wise
when they said

641
00:59:03,711 --> 00:59:07,827
We need to keep dry liquids
joins in for the blessing.

642
00:59:09,913 --> 00:59:10,568
Him.

643
00:59:11,362 --> 00:59:12,043
Sure there.

644
00:59:12,749 --> 00:59:14,682
Hey treacherous.

645
00:59:15,531 --> 00:59:16,372
You start.

646
00:59:19,377 --> 00:59:21,016
Is the child.

647
00:59:22,219 --> 00:59:24,221
Just a minute.

648
00:59:26,929 --> 00:59:28,139
What do you do?

649
00:59:54,520 --> 00:59:55,218
They come to me.

650
00:59:55,774 --> 00:59:56,150
Who?

651
00:59:56,185 --> 00:59:56,754
The guards.

652
00:59:56,789 --> 00:59:57,520
Why?

653
00:59:59,617 --> 01:00:00,090
I do not know.

654
01:00:00,125 --> 01:00:01,396
What is this?

655
01:00:01,431 --> 01:00:03,112
We later for the great
day of singing.

656
01:00:03,147 --> 01:00:04,063
Excuse me Mrs.

657
01:00:04,781 --> 01:00:06,384
Lina trying Mayfleet.

658
01:00:07,012 --> 01:00:08,822
She is not likely here
continue in his job.

659
01:00:09,627 --> 01:00:10,105
Ok.

660
01:00:11,847 --> 01:00:12,571
If you do not care.

661
01:00:12,606 --> 01:00:13,923
Excuse me, but rude.

662
01:00:19,593 --> 01:00:21,997
He knows that, the mayor is giving
a reward.

663
01:00:23,051 --> 01:00:23,896
At home.

664
01:00:23,931 --> 01:00:26,044
She will find in the house
green with a friend.

665
01:00:26,863 --> 01:00:27,627
Does that help?

666
01:00:33,092 --> 01:00:34,006
REQUESTED

667
01:00:34,647 --> 01:00:35,514
Rewarding

668
01:00:57,446 --> 01:00:57,925
Come on.

669
01:00:58,757 --> 01:01:00,049
Why are destroying everything?

670
01:01:00,846 --> 01:01:01,491
Silly.

671
01:01:31,307 --> 01:01:32,011
A warning.

672
01:01:33,062 --> 01:01:34,488
If you think that is helping
for them.

673
01:01:37,038 --> 01:01:38,043
Why is that?

674
01:01:42,843 --> 01:01:44,988
I have information that I received this
tomorrow.

675
01:01:45,023 --> 01:01:46,880
Who gave that information?

676
01:01:47,508 --> 01:01:48,464
It is confidential.

677
01:01:49,210 --> 01:01:50,912
What I need is to understand that.

678
01:01:51,721 --> 01:01:52,834
If you're in return.

679
01:01:52,869 --> 01:01:54,112
The lock.

680
01:01:56,411 --> 01:01:59,033
They can hear it, they can see.

681
01:01:59,723 --> 01:02:00,870
Você. tell me.

682
01:02:02,137 --> 01:02:03,444
Otherwise, there will be consequences.

683
01:02:04,944 --> 01:02:10,573
If you're worried that you'll see your hero
I hope he will give me information.

684
01:02:13,232 --> 01:02:14,994
For the night with the mayor.

685
01:03:00,733 --> 01:03:01,462
We will find.

686
01:03:03,293 --> 01:03:03,840
Come on.

687
01:03:11,953 --> 01:03:12,440
What is this?

688
01:03:23,012 --> 01:03:23,712
My dad did this.

689
01:03:28,195 --> 01:03:29,643
He does not seem to be very safe.

690
01:03:30,322 --> 01:03:31,027
That will see.

691
01:03:36,881 --> 01:03:38,409
Have you ever done something?

692
01:03:39,312 --> 01:03:40,196
What do you mean with your father?

693
01:03:41,417 --> 01:03:44,593
Harrow voice on the machine
answering machine.

694
01:03:45,698 --> 01:03:46,839
I found the name of his father was
Laurence.

695
01:03:47,666 --> 01:03:48,417
Parrol Harrow.

696
01:03:49,425 --> 01:03:51,529
On his behalf.

697
01:03:52,300 --> 01:03:53,178
It is for sure.

698
01:03:53,213 --> 01:03:54,026
You are a child.

699
01:03:55,961 --> 01:03:57,687
This means that our fathers
tried to run together.

700
01:03:59,408 --> 01:03:59,955
Try.

701
01:04:02,453 --> 01:04:04,916
But we do not have time to be coming back
for us.

702
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:22,959
Hold on.

703
01:04:29,262 --> 01:04:30,282
Now you stay here.

704
01:04:31,780 --> 01:04:32,853
And quietita.

705
01:04:33,819 --> 01:04:34,454
Hi

706
01:04:35,216 --> 01:04:36,622
She is here somewhere.

707
01:04:41,544 --> 01:04:42,234
Do you see anything?

708
01:04:42,796 --> 01:04:43,483
No.

709
01:04:58,049 --> 01:04:58,812
Here is your day.

710
01:05:00,250 --> 01:05:03,217
From time to celebrate the year
for our city.

711
01:05:04,133 --> 01:05:05,778
The voice of life.

712
01:05:06,444 --> 01:05:09,679
In the world of darkness.

713
01:05:25,976 --> 01:05:26,965
This is covering.

714
01:05:32,436 --> 01:05:34,075
This plan miraculous.

715
01:05:34,699 --> 01:05:37,547
This dazzling ingenuity.

716
01:05:38,015 --> 01:05:45,348
It is our city of coal.

717
01:06:08,873 --> 01:06:09,902
They began to sing.

718
01:06:18,709 --> 01:06:19,556
I have something to show you.

719
01:06:20,482 --> 01:06:21,334
What was the mayor.

720
01:06:23,162 --> 01:06:23,848
Will you give?

721
01:06:24,784 --> 01:06:25,595
Not exactly.

722
01:06:42,423 --> 01:06:43,132
The generator.

723
01:06:44,292 --> 01:06:45,933
Okay, I have to get there.

724
01:06:46,950 --> 01:06:47,889
I must follow.

725
01:06:49,720 --> 01:06:50,181
Wait.

726
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:52,166
Poppy.

727
01:07:22,474 --> 01:07:23,317
Come here.

728
01:07:44,176 --> 01:07:44,837
That's it.

729
01:07:53,746 --> 01:07:54,265
Poppy.

730
01:07:56,559 --> 01:07:57,443
Maybe you know.

731
01:08:01,097 --> 01:08:02,063
We need help.

732
01:08:03,700 --> 01:08:05,001
We have to bear.

733
01:08:05,036 --> 01:08:05,673
Wake up.

734
01:08:05,708 --> 01:08:06,877
We need the door to the generator.

735
01:08:07,808 --> 01:08:09,701
Obviously, there is a wrench.

736
01:08:10,246 --> 01:08:11,263
Well, where is he?

737
01:08:12,184 --> 01:08:13,711
I do not know, it's not my job.

738
01:08:25,905 --> 01:08:26,416
Wait.

739
01:08:28,235 --> 01:08:29,024
Something is not right.

740
01:08:30,380 --> 01:08:32,740
He is very smart, you would not
so simple.

741
01:08:34,505 --> 01:08:35,523
What is the easy part?

742
01:08:38,272 --> 01:08:40,171
Walking toward the back.

743
01:08:52,129 --> 01:08:54,030
It will be everything.

744
01:09:02,764 --> 01:09:03,256
Doon.

745
01:09:09,124 --> 01:09:10,364
There is something behind these
lockers.

746
01:09:13,984 --> 01:09:14,536
Come on, walk.

747
01:09:21,161 --> 01:09:22,067
There must be a way to go.

748
01:09:57,845 --> 01:10:00,261
That's good.

749
01:10:03,430 --> 01:10:04,257
Jackpot.

750
01:10:13,288 --> 01:10:15,125
Given intelligence.

751
01:10:23,650 --> 01:10:23,919
What is this?

752
01:11:09,569 --> 01:11:10,647
Style is another.

753
01:12:37,559 --> 01:12:39,676
Still, it is very low.

754
01:12:40,243 --> 01:12:41,018
What will strike.

755
01:12:45,279 --> 01:12:46,599
You must take off the road.

756
01:12:47,770 --> 01:12:49,723
It is not supposed to hide
the head.

757
01:12:50,491 --> 01:12:52,647
We have to follow instructions
exactly.

758
01:12:54,630 --> 01:12:55,746
What has to say.

759
01:12:58,862 --> 01:13:02,611
Access ... something ... something ... room.

760
01:13:13,114 --> 01:13:13,768
Come on Poppy.

761
01:13:25,406 --> 01:13:27,283
It should be an area that
seek.

762
01:13:28,007 --> 01:13:28,651
Now.

763
01:13:29,699 --> 01:13:30,922
He has control.

764
01:13:35,183 --> 01:13:35,781
Door.

765
01:13:53,147 --> 01:13:54,804
Come on, come on.

766
01:14:02,041 --> 01:14:02,855
Well done.

767
01:14:35,954 --> 01:14:36,523
You okay?

768
01:15:37,072 --> 01:15:40,406
Set ... complete confidence.

769
01:15:44,575 --> 01:15:45,846
Ok.

770
01:15:53,550 --> 01:15:54,164
What follows,

771
01:15:54,543 --> 01:15:56,538
Set ... 2 to completely stopped.

772
01:15:57,544 --> 01:15:58,553
Completely stopped

773
01:16:38,173 --> 01:16:39,109
Displayed.

774
01:16:44,264 --> 01:16:45,227
Stay here.

775
01:16:59,589 --> 01:17:00,693
What are you doing here?

776
01:17:01,149 --> 01:17:02,660
This thing is stuck.

777
01:17:03,586 --> 01:17:04,651
I am libero.

778
01:17:05,092 --> 01:17:06,157
And what are you doing this?

779
01:17:10,336 --> 01:17:11,775
It is my job.

780
01:17:17,338 --> 01:17:18,100
Try this.

781
01:17:27,486 --> 01:17:28,148
Yeah.

782
01:17:34,614 --> 01:17:35,427
Is working.

783
01:17:37,045 --> 01:17:37,989
It is the exit.

784
01:17:38,794 --> 01:17:39,569
It is the way to do it.

785
01:17:40,872 --> 01:17:41,772
What kid?

786
01:17:42,277 --> 01:17:42,815
Come on.

787
01:18:42,173 --> 01:18:42,599
Come on.

788
01:18:51,377 --> 01:18:51,957
You okay?

789
01:18:52,483 --> 01:18:52,965
Yes

790
01:19:32,592 --> 01:19:34,783
We gotta go now.

791
01:19:35,936 --> 01:19:37,538
But I have to keep this
sustained.

792
01:19:37,573 --> 01:19:38,632
No, come with me.

793
01:19:39,346 --> 01:19:39,874
You will.

794
01:19:40,964 --> 01:19:41,582
Go away.

795
01:19:45,399 --> 01:19:46,193
It's all mine.

796
01:19:56,140 --> 01:19:56,843
You okay?

797
01:19:58,286 --> 01:19:58,984
We have to go.

798
01:19:59,596 --> 01:20:00,870
'We're not seeing that happen.

799
01:20:01,753 --> 01:20:02,671
There is no option to go.

800
01:20:13,692 --> 01:20:14,359
Hold on.

801
01:20:24,294 --> 01:20:25,136
Work.

802
01:21:12,760 --> 01:21:13,981
Mirko.

803
01:21:18,955 --> 01:21:19,562
Free.

804
01:21:22,825 --> 01:21:25,098
You told me that I stay.

805
01:21:25,848 --> 01:21:26,557
Wait.

806
01:21:47,149 --> 01:21:48,145
We were me and you.

807
01:21:50,299 --> 01:21:51,550
Teneíamos a deal.

808
01:21:54,112 --> 01:21:54,729
Open the door.

809
01:21:59,041 --> 01:22:01,067
He said.

810
01:22:27,002 --> 01:22:27,811
We're going to the right.

811
01:22:28,835 --> 01:22:29,423
The right.

812
01:22:29,962 --> 01:22:30,664
Ok.

813
01:23:06,297 --> 01:23:07,185
Drop.

814
01:24:03,126 --> 01:24:05,309
You're there!

815
01:24:54,275 --> 01:24:55,986
This is something we never heard.

816
01:25:34,446 --> 01:25:36,162
One step at the time!

817
01:25:42,114 --> 01:25:43,830
Do not charge!

818
01:25:47,421 --> 01:25:49,597
Discharge care with the baby

819
01:26:27,984 --> 01:26:28,825
It was raining.

820
01:26:30,459 --> 01:26:32,046
There is nothing better than this.

821
01:27:50,909 --> 01:27:51,588
It is blue.

822
01:28:07,023 --> 01:28:07,944
You can see it.

823
01:28:08,613 --> 01:28:09,320
Hello!

824
01:28:10,640 --> 01:28:11,279
Do not listen to you.

825
01:28:12,831 --> 01:28:13,587
Are very far.

826
01:28:15,764 --> 01:28:17,310
But we have to decircelos
in some way.

827
01:28:17,345 --> 01:28:18,660
We have to tell you what
There are up here.

828
01:28:20,581 --> 01:28:24,269
Lina and placed their Destination
Hopefully in a rock.

829
01:28:24,304 --> 01:28:26,273
And fell.

830
01:28:35,937 --> 01:28:38,705
The rock, could have been arrested
somewhere roof.

831
01:28:41,343 --> 01:28:42,876
But, he continued.

832
01:28:45,550 --> 01:28:47,757
And their luck took another
course.

833
01:28:50,088 --> 01:28:52,524
And the message passed on the way.

834
01:29:01,690 --> 01:29:04,296
Now things were clear
for all.

835
01:29:06,853 --> 01:29:07,769
From all this.

836
01:29:08,350 --> 01:29:11,200
Wine of the flame burning.

837
01:29:11,235 --> 01:29:12,461
Throughout the darkness.

838
01:29:12,496 --> 01:29:14,901
So we could live again
on earth.

839
01:29:16,295 --> 01:29:18,106
On air and light.
