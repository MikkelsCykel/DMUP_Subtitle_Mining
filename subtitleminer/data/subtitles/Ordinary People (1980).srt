What's your theory
on Jude Fawley?

Was he powerless in

I think he moved to Skokie.

Are you getting enough sleep?

344
00:21:36,814 --> 00:21:38,211
Yeah.

345
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:41,240
Are you having fun?

346
00:21:41,317 --> 00:21:42,577
Fun?

347
00:21:42,653 --> 00:21:46,180
There's no point
if you're not having fun.

348
00:21:46,257 --> 00:21:48,191
Yeah. I guess so.

349
00:21:48,259 --> 00:21:49,655
You guess so.

350
00:21:52,229 --> 00:21:54,220
Are you on medication?

351
00:21:54,298 --> 00:21:55,694
Tranquilizers?

352
00:21:55,766 --> 00:21:56,991
Anything?

353
00:21:57,067 --> 00:21:59,592
No. No. Sir.

354
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:02,261
Did I ask you
if they gave you shock?

355
00:22:02,336 --> 00:22:03,826
Yeah.

356
00:22:03,905 --> 00:22:05,432
Yeah what?

357
00:22:05,509 --> 00:22:07,337
Yeah. You asked me.

358
00:22:07,411 --> 00:22:08,844
Yeah. They did.

359
00:22:11,115 --> 00:22:13,015
Don't look at us. Lazenby.

360
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:15,017
Get in the water!

361
00:22:19,923 --> 00:22:23,257
I'm no doctor. Jarrett.

362
00:22:23,326 --> 00:22:27,057
I wouldn't let them
put electricity in my head.

363
00:22:29,163 --> 00:22:31,097
He drives me nuts!

364
00:22:31,165 --> 00:22:33,827
Everybody drives you nuts.

365
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:38,074
Don and Fenetch looked good.

366
00:22:38,142 --> 00:22:40,007
They looked very good.

367
00:22:40,076 --> 00:22:43,009
Is he giving you a hard time?

368
00:22:43,077 --> 00:22:45,011
Want a clarinet?

369
00:22:45,082 --> 00:22:47,016
Van Buren wants a clarinet.

370
00:22:47,084 --> 00:22:48,517
Who's selling it?

371
00:22:48,586 --> 00:22:50,519
My brother.
He needs a motorcycle.

372
00:22:50,586 --> 00:22:53,056
You stand behind me
in the choir.

373
00:22:53,123 --> 00:22:55,717
Oh. I do?
Is that you?

374
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:58,159
You have a lot of energy.

375
00:22:58,229 --> 00:22:59,250
I do?

376
00:22:59,327 --> 00:23:01,057
I mean. That's good.

377
00:23:01,131 --> 00:23:03,065
My name's Jeannine Pratt.

378
00:23:03,133 --> 00:23:04,566
Nice. Hi.

379
00:23:04,634 --> 00:23:06,067
You're Conrad Jarrett.

380
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:07,296
Right.

381
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:11,065
Yeah. Um. Bye.

382
00:23:11,141 --> 00:23:12,574
Bye-bye.

383
00:23:13,644 --> 00:23:16,576
"You've got a lot of energy."

384
00:23:19,981 --> 00:23:21,576
[Children]
Trick or treat!

385
00:23:21,652 --> 00:23:25,086
You're the scariest
ghost I've ever seen!

386
00:23:25,153 --> 00:23:26,586
You look wonderful.

387
00:23:26,654 --> 00:23:28,588
Thank you.

388
00:23:28,659 --> 00:23:29,588
There you go.

389
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:31,093
Be careful.

390
00:23:31,161 --> 00:23:33,095
Thank you.
Good-bye.

391
00:23:34,163 --> 00:23:36,596
The Cabots.
Julie's first time.

392
00:23:36,664 --> 00:23:38,601
She's so cute!

393
00:23:40,434 --> 00:23:42,997
Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!

394
00:23:43,073 --> 00:23:46,269
Know what I've been thinking?

395
00:23:46,343 --> 00:23:48,277
That Christmas in London...

396
00:23:48,345 --> 00:23:51,778
would be like something
out of Dickens.

397
00:23:51,846 --> 00:23:54,280
We've never done that before.

398
00:23:54,351 --> 00:23:58,788
Maybe we shouldn't plan
to go away right now.

399
00:23:58,855 --> 00:24:00,788
We talked about it.

400
00:24:00,855 --> 00:24:02,789
We decided on that.

401
00:24:02,857 --> 00:24:04,794
Yeah. I know that.

402
00:24:04,862 --> 00:24:07,797
But the timing
doesn't seem right.

403
00:24:07,865 --> 00:24:10,798
We've always gone away
at Christmas.

404
00:24:10,865 --> 00:24:13,528
It'd be good for him. Too.

405
00:24:13,604 --> 00:24:16,038
Let's get back to normal.

406
00:24:16,105 --> 00:24:18,799
He's just started
with this doctor.

407
00:24:18,875 --> 00:24:20,807
He'll miss three weeks.

408
00:24:20,875 --> 00:24:22,308
Why interrupt it?

409
00:24:22,376 --> 00:24:25,314
Because I want to get away.

410
00:24:25,382 --> 00:24:28,317
I think we should.
It's important.

411
00:24:28,384 --> 00:24:32,819
Not if he doesn't
go through with this now.

412
00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:35,324
He might change his mind.

413
00:24:35,392 --> 00:24:37,826
If he changes his mind...

414
00:24:37,894 --> 00:24:40,087
it wasn't right for him.

415
00:24:40,163 --> 00:24:42,428
Does he want to go?

416
00:24:42,499 --> 00:24:45,432
He doesn't know what he wants.

417
00:26:52,626 --> 00:26:54,392
Ahh!

418
00:26:54,462 --> 00:26:56,160
Don't do that!

419
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:57,663
I'm sorry.

420
00:26:57,732 --> 00:27:00,670
I didn't think you were here.

421
00:27:00,738 --> 00:27:02,672
I just got in.

422
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:04,673
No golf today.
Too cold.

423
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:06,173
How was golf?

424
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,673
I didn't play.

425
00:27:07,742 --> 00:27:09,178
It's colder today.

426
00:27:09,246 --> 00:27:12,682
I mean. For the year.
It's colder.

427
00:27:13,884 --> 00:27:15,317
Weren't you swimming?

428
00:27:15,384 --> 00:27:17,817
Yeah. Sorry I scared you.

429
00:27:17,885 --> 00:27:19,318
How'd it go?

430
00:27:19,386 --> 00:27:21,323
Good. I swam well.

431
00:27:21,391 --> 00:27:22,323
Good.

432
00:27:22,392 --> 00:27:25,826
I could swim the 50 if my...

433
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:27,827
my timing got better.

434
00:27:27,895 --> 00:27:29,832
I'm a little off.

435
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:32,334
You must work at that.

436
00:27:32,402 --> 00:27:33,334
Yeah.

437
00:27:33,403 --> 00:27:37,441
I got 74 on a Trig quiz.

438
00:27:37,574 --> 00:27:38,971
74?

439
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:41,977
Gee. I was awful at Trig.

440
00:27:42,045 --> 00:27:43,478
Oh. Yeah? Did you...

441
00:27:43,547 --> 00:27:45,708
You took Trig?

442
00:27:48,018 --> 00:27:49,644
Wait a minute.

443
00:27:52,055 --> 00:27:53,613
Did I take Trig?

444
00:27:57,294 --> 00:28:00,957
I bought you two shirts.
They're on your bed.

445
00:28:04,731 --> 00:28:06,565
Who'll be there?

446
00:28:06,634 --> 00:28:10,663
Well. The Murrays.
The Gunthers. And the Caines.

447
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:13,538
Let's go to the movies instead.

448
00:28:13,607 --> 00:28:16,269
Don't be negative.

449
00:28:16,346 --> 00:28:18,678
That's not negative.
That's unpredictable.

450
00:28:18,748 --> 00:28:21,077
Let's go to the movies.

451
00:28:21,151 --> 00:28:22,548
Okay.

452
00:28:22,616 --> 00:28:24,174
Really?

453
00:28:24,251 --> 00:28:27,018
Okay. Yeah.
Come on. Let's go.

454
00:28:27,087 --> 00:28:28,520
What's our excuse?

455
00:28:29,593 --> 00:28:33,356
Beth wanted to go
to the movies.

456
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:34,519
Good.

457
00:28:34,596 --> 00:28:36,122
Very good.

458
00:28:41,702 --> 00:28:43,636
All right now. Smile.

459
00:28:43,707 --> 00:28:46,574
Remember. Not too many martinis.

460
00:28:51,211 --> 00:28:54,650
Will you put that
with the others?

461
00:28:54,718 --> 00:28:56,652
Look. We're in time.

462
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,153
Look who's here!

463
00:28:58,221 --> 00:29:02,154
Three blocks away
and the last to arrive.

464
00:29:02,222 --> 00:29:03,655
Come on in.

465
00:29:03,727 --> 00:29:06,161
Happy birthday!
You look wonderful.

466
00:29:06,229 --> 00:29:07,662
Is that new?

467
00:29:07,730 --> 00:29:10,663
Yes. It is.
Do you like it?

468
00:29:11,732 --> 00:29:13,097
You did the mousse?

469
00:29:13,169 --> 00:29:14,463
It turned out well?

470
00:29:14,538 --> 00:29:17,096
Hey. Partner.
How are you?

471
00:29:17,173 --> 00:29:18,834
Hi there.

472
00:29:18,909 --> 00:29:20,807
Hi. Beth.

473
00:29:20,875 --> 00:29:22,401
Good to see you.

474
00:29:22,479 --> 00:29:23,807
Borrow the money.

475
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,313
I'll go public.

476
00:29:25,382 --> 00:29:29,478
I wouldn't do it now
because the market's low.

477
00:29:29,553 --> 00:29:31,316
Your hair looks wonderful.

478
00:29:31,385 --> 00:29:33,913
It's shorter. You like it?

479
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:37,585
I said.
"Please put out your cigar."

480
00:29:37,661 --> 00:29:41,461
He says. "Huh?
I don't have another one."

481
00:29:42,663 --> 00:29:45,097
Good to see you!

482
00:29:45,165 --> 00:29:47,432
You look beautiful. As ever.

483
00:29:47,501 --> 00:29:48,934
In school...

484
00:29:49,005 --> 00:29:54,102
they think they've got
to walk on the edge of danger.

485
00:29:54,174 --> 00:29:56,269
What are these hushed tones?

486
00:29:56,346 --> 00:29:58,403
He told the funniest joke!

487
00:30:00,682 --> 00:30:03,084
I'm not talking to you.

488
00:30:03,153 --> 00:30:04,450
Why?

489
00:30:04,519 --> 00:30:08,218
I have my fingers crossed
on this merger.

490
00:30:08,288 --> 00:30:09,451
Let's have lunch.

491
00:30:09,526 --> 00:30:11,788
I don't know my schedule.

492
00:30:11,861 --> 00:30:14,125
I'm free most days.

493
00:30:14,194 --> 00:30:16,788
Bob McLean's leaving
Coles and Johnson.

494
00:30:16,865 --> 00:30:18,798
Where is he going?

495
00:30:18,865 --> 00:30:20,836
He doesn't know.

496
00:30:20,903 --> 00:30:22,132
Jesus.

497
00:30:22,202 --> 00:30:23,672
No. You didn't.

498
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:27,073
Isn't he the meanest man
you've met?

499
00:30:27,143 --> 00:30:29,441
When a ball is in play.

500
00:30:29,509 --> 00:30:33,471
If a player or caddy
accidentally move it...

501
00:30:33,548 --> 00:30:35,674
#Jolly good fellow #

502
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:38,220
# For he's a jolly good fellow ##

503
00:30:40,323 --> 00:30:43,486
# Won't regret. Can't forget #

504
00:30:43,557 --> 00:30:45,892
# What we did #

505
00:30:45,961 --> 00:30:48,487
# For #

506
00:30:48,565 --> 00:30:53,332
# Love ##

507
00:30:57,007 --> 00:31:00,170
Hi. Annie. What's your boy up to?

508
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,673
Oh. Who knows?

509
00:31:01,742 --> 00:31:03,508
How's Conrad doing?

510
00:31:03,577 --> 00:31:05,511
He's great. Just great.

511
00:31:05,582 --> 00:31:09,778
I asked Donald.
He says they haven't talked much.

512
00:31:09,853 --> 00:31:12,515
I said maybe he's self-conscious.

513
00:31:12,586 --> 00:31:13,519
Oh!

514
00:31:16,923 --> 00:31:19,519
No. No. No.

515
00:31:19,596 --> 00:31:21,528
No. He's...

516
00:31:21,596 --> 00:31:25,125
There's a doctor
in Highland Park...

517
00:31:25,201 --> 00:31:27,530
that he sees twice a week.

518
00:31:27,604 --> 00:31:29,865
He's great. Just great.

519
00:31:29,939 --> 00:31:33,102
Is he still having some problems?

520
00:31:33,173 --> 00:31:35,038
No. Nothing like that.

521
00:31:35,111 --> 00:31:37,545
Just somebody to talk to...

522
00:31:37,614 --> 00:31:39,980
to polish off the rough edges.

523
00:31:40,048 --> 00:31:41,605
How are you. Darling?

524
00:31:41,682 --> 00:31:44,116
Is he falling asleep on you?

525
00:31:44,184 --> 00:31:45,913
Nah. He's great.

526
00:31:47,190 --> 00:31:48,987
[Mimicking "Mr. Wonderful"]
# Mr. Great. That's me #

527
00:31:54,064 --> 00:31:54,996
Hey.

528
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:58,790
You drank too much.

529
00:31:58,865 --> 00:32:00,298
I'm not drunk.

530
00:32:00,367 --> 00:32:03,962
Why did you tell Annie
about Conrad's psychiatrist?

531
00:32:04,038 --> 00:32:05,471
Why not?

532
00:32:05,539 --> 00:32:08,634
People don't hear
that thing easily.

533
00:32:08,711 --> 00:32:12,145
For most people.
It's a status symbol.

534
00:32:12,212 --> 00:32:14,646
Well. Your blurting it out...

535
00:32:14,718 --> 00:32:16,652
was a violation of privacy.

536
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,153
Whose privacy?

537
00:32:18,221 --> 00:32:20,049
The family's privacy!

538
00:32:20,123 --> 00:32:23,057
I think it is
a very private matter.

539
00:32:30,798 --> 00:32:33,064
I tell you my dreams?

540
00:32:33,134 --> 00:32:35,567
I don't believe in dreams.

541
00:32:35,635 --> 00:32:39,096
What kind of
a psychiatrist are you?

542
00:32:39,173 --> 00:32:41,575
What's happening?

543
00:32:42,711 --> 00:32:44,009
What's going on?

544
00:32:44,077 --> 00:32:46,011
I just feel...

545
00:32:46,082 --> 00:32:48,073
I feel so...

546
00:32:50,183 --> 00:32:51,115
What?

547
00:32:51,184 --> 00:32:52,981
Jumpy. I don't know.

548
00:32:53,056 --> 00:32:54,546
Look. Kiddo...

549
00:32:55,625 --> 00:32:57,217
I lied.

550
00:32:58,294 --> 00:33:00,228
I believe in dreams.

551
00:33:00,296 --> 00:33:04,230
Sometimes I want to know
what's happening when you're awake.

552
00:33:04,298 --> 00:33:06,632
Something's making you nervous.

553
00:33:06,701 --> 00:33:09,171
Maybe I need a tranquilizer.

554
00:33:09,239 --> 00:33:10,328
Tranquilizer?

555
00:33:10,403 --> 00:33:12,701
What do you think?

556
00:33:12,776 --> 00:33:16,231
You look like something
out of The Body Snatchers.

557
00:33:16,309 --> 00:33:19,576
It's not my impression
that you need a tranquilizer.

558
00:33:21,481 --> 00:33:23,111
What is this?

559
00:33:23,183 --> 00:33:24,913
A clock.

560
00:33:24,988 --> 00:33:28,423
You can tell the time.
But I can't.

561
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:31,616
So you know when
the hour's up?

562
00:33:31,692 --> 00:33:32,953
Right.

563
00:33:33,028 --> 00:33:34,653
50. 55 minutes?

564
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:47,173
Maybe I don't want
to swim anymore.

565
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:49,675
My timing is for shit.

566
00:33:49,746 --> 00:33:53,181
Two guys better than me
swim the 50.

567
00:33:53,248 --> 00:33:56,182
They're a bunch of boring jocks.

568
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:59,221
And him...
I can't stand him.

569
00:33:59,288 --> 00:34:01,050
Thought about quitting?

570
00:34:01,123 --> 00:34:02,112
You telling me to?

571
00:34:02,192 --> 00:34:03,713
Nope.

572
00:34:03,791 --> 00:34:05,920
It wouldn't look good.

573
00:34:05,992 --> 00:34:07,360
How does it feel?

574
00:34:09,632 --> 00:34:12,396
How does it feel?

575
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:14,867
Yes.
How does it feel?

576
00:34:15,972 --> 00:34:20,170
It's the same damn thing
I did last year.

577
00:34:20,242 --> 00:34:22,972
Are you the same
person now?

578
00:34:23,045 --> 00:34:26,106
That's why you need
a tranquilizer?

579
00:34:26,181 --> 00:34:27,239
You're a doctor.

580
00:34:27,317 --> 00:34:30,581
I'm supposed to
feel better. Right?

581
00:34:30,652 --> 00:34:32,177
Not necessarily.

582
00:34:38,561 --> 00:34:42,088
Is it getting any easier
with your friends?

583
00:34:42,164 --> 00:34:44,190
No. It's still hard.

584
00:34:44,266 --> 00:34:46,201
Is anyplace easy?

585
00:34:49,771 --> 00:34:51,431
The hospital was.

586
00:34:51,507 --> 00:34:53,304
It was? Why?

587
00:34:55,478 --> 00:34:58,675
Because nobody
hid anything there.

588
00:34:58,748 --> 00:35:02,411
Was there anyone there
you could talk to?

589
00:35:02,485 --> 00:35:03,543
Uh-huh.

590
00:35:03,619 --> 00:35:06,088
I mean, beside Dr. Crawford?

591
00:35:06,155 --> 00:35:07,588
Uh-huh.

592
00:35:15,264 --> 00:35:16,197
Whoa!

593
00:35:16,266 --> 00:35:17,789
Hi.

594
00:35:17,867 --> 00:35:18,797
Karen!

595
00:35:18,867 --> 00:35:20,300
How are you?

596
00:35:20,369 --> 00:35:21,460
Good.

597
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:22,969
Sit down. Please.

598
00:35:23,039 --> 00:35:25,097
Thank you.

599
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:31,505
Wow.

600
00:35:53,936 --> 00:35:56,371
When did you get back?

601
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:58,373
The end of August.

602
00:35:58,442 --> 00:35:59,373
Good.

603
00:35:59,443 --> 00:36:01,376
It's great to see you.

604
00:36:01,445 --> 00:36:03,413
Oh. You. Too.

605
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:06,880
Listen. I've got a meeting
over at the school.

606
00:36:06,949 --> 00:36:08,382
Drama Club meeting.

607
00:36:08,452 --> 00:36:10,885
We're doing
A Thousand Clowns.

608
00:36:10,954 --> 00:36:12,387
You know it?

609
00:36:12,456 --> 00:36:16,085
Anyway. We're going crazy
getting it together.

610
00:36:16,159 --> 00:36:18,389
Don't let me hang you up.

611
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:22,125
No. I wanted to see you.

612
00:36:22,199 --> 00:36:25,134
I didn't know what to expect.

613
00:36:25,202 --> 00:36:28,137
You sounded funny on the phone.

614
00:36:28,204 --> 00:36:31,139
It was just a gray day.

615
00:36:31,208 --> 00:36:34,199
Everything's great.
I'm on the swim team.

616
00:36:34,277 --> 00:36:35,869
Oh. You're swimming?

617
00:36:35,945 --> 00:36:37,971
Terrific. Conrad.

618
00:36:38,047 --> 00:36:39,572
That's really wonderful.

619
00:36:39,650 --> 00:36:42,050
I could be benched all year.

620
00:36:42,119 --> 00:36:44,451
You'll do great.

621
00:36:44,521 --> 00:36:48,855
I'll bet your folks
are real proud of you.

622
00:36:48,925 --> 00:36:49,856
Yeah.

623
00:36:49,925 --> 00:36:52,190
What can I get you?

624
00:36:52,262 --> 00:36:53,695
Are you hungry?

625
00:36:53,764 --> 00:36:55,197
Just a coke.

626
00:36:55,264 --> 00:36:57,630
Two cokes. Please.

627
00:36:57,701 --> 00:36:59,498
Did we offend him?

628
00:36:59,568 --> 00:37:00,695
Something I said?

629
00:37:02,105 --> 00:37:04,938
A low self-image day.

630
00:37:07,043 --> 00:37:08,534
So. Uh...

631
00:37:08,612 --> 00:37:09,873
- Are you...
- What did...

632
00:37:12,481 --> 00:37:15,918
I can't believe
how beautiful you look.

633
00:37:15,985 --> 00:37:18,318
You really look beautiful.

634
00:37:18,387 --> 00:37:20,652
So do you.

635
00:37:20,724 --> 00:37:22,351
Do you miss it?

636
00:37:22,425 --> 00:37:23,585
Miss what?

637
00:37:23,659 --> 00:37:24,853
The hospital.

638
00:37:24,927 --> 00:37:26,918
No.

639
00:37:26,996 --> 00:37:28,692
Thank you.

640
00:37:28,764 --> 00:37:30,494
You don't miss it?

641
00:37:30,567 --> 00:37:31,693
No.

642
00:37:31,768 --> 00:37:34,463
You don't miss Leo's corny jokes?

643
00:37:38,608 --> 00:37:40,166
Are you seeing a doctor?

644
00:37:40,242 --> 00:37:43,143
Yeah. I'm seeing one. Are you?

645
00:37:43,213 --> 00:37:46,306
Uh. Dr. Crawford gave me a name.

646
00:37:46,382 --> 00:37:48,817
I went for a while.

647
00:37:48,885 --> 00:37:50,818
It didn't work.

648
00:37:50,887 --> 00:37:54,322
He told me the things
I already knew.

649
00:37:54,391 --> 00:37:55,824
Finally. I decided...

650
00:37:55,891 --> 00:37:58,952
the only one who
can help me is myself.

651
00:38:01,097 --> 00:38:04,795
At least. That's what
my dad says.

652
00:38:04,867 --> 00:38:07,496
If it's something
you want to do.

653
00:38:07,570 --> 00:38:10,335
That's what you
should be doing.

654
00:38:10,407 --> 00:38:14,172
I don't know
how long I'll keep it up.

655
00:38:17,047 --> 00:38:18,742
Your hair grew in.

656
00:38:18,815 --> 00:38:23,148
Oh. That was such
a dumb thing to do.

657
00:38:23,219 --> 00:38:24,847
I like it.

658
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,353
You do?

659
00:38:26,422 --> 00:38:27,822
Yeah.

660
00:38:29,925 --> 00:38:32,360
I don't know.
I just...

661
00:38:32,429 --> 00:38:34,362
I miss it sometimes.

662
00:38:34,431 --> 00:38:35,864
The hospital.

663
00:38:35,931 --> 00:38:37,592
I really do.

664
00:38:40,003 --> 00:38:42,436
Things have to change. You know?

665
00:38:42,505 --> 00:38:44,735
But that's where we laughed.

666
00:38:44,806 --> 00:38:47,106
But that was a hospital.

667
00:38:47,177 --> 00:38:50,668
This is the real world.

668
00:38:50,746 --> 00:38:52,612
I guess you're right.

669
00:38:59,856 --> 00:39:02,347
I really have to go.

670
00:39:02,425 --> 00:39:03,688
I'm sorry.

671
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:07,126
I have a meeting at the school.

672
00:39:07,197 --> 00:39:09,630
We're doing A Thousand Clowns.

673
00:39:09,699 --> 00:39:11,632
You told me.

674
00:39:13,369 --> 00:39:15,268
Did I?

675
00:39:15,338 --> 00:39:17,635
Yeah.

676
00:39:17,706 --> 00:39:19,139
I better hurry.

677
00:39:19,208 --> 00:39:21,643
Don't want to be late.

678
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:26,315
Thanks for seeing me.

679
00:39:28,284 --> 00:39:29,650
Conrad?

680
00:39:30,853 --> 00:39:33,219
Let's have a great Christmas.

00:39:39,128 --> 00:39:41,597
a great year.

684
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:45,927
Let's have the best year
of our lives.

685
00:39:47,938 --> 00:39:50,565
This could be
the best year ever.

Yeah.

00:40:00,983 --> 00:40:02,416
You mean it?

692
00:40:02,485 --> 00:40:03,418
Yep.

It's cold.

701
00:41:05,282 --> 00:41:07,215
You should put that on.

702
00:41:07,284 --> 00:41:09,217
Do you want a sweater?

703
00:41:09,286 --> 00:41:10,583
Do I need one?

00:41:16,793 --> 00:41:18,726

705
00:41:18,795 --> 00:41:20,228
Nothing.

707
00:41:24,166 --> 00:41:25,532
About what?

708
00:41:25,601 --> 00:41:27,034
Not about anything.

709
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:34,034
Your hair is starting to grow out.

710
00:41:34,110 --> 00:41:36,043
It's looking... looking better.

711
00:41:41,885 --> 00:41:44,820
I was thinking
about the pigeon...

712
00:41:44,887 --> 00:41:47,322
that hung around the garage.

713
00:41:47,389 --> 00:41:52,157
How it used to get
on top of your car.

714
00:41:52,228 --> 00:41:53,717
Oh. Yeah.
I remember.

715
00:41:55,797 --> 00:41:58,324
I remember
how scared I got...

716
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,335
That wsssshhhhh!
Flap. Flap. Flap...

717
00:42:00,402 --> 00:42:03,338
Every time I started the car.

718
00:42:03,405 --> 00:42:08,503
That was the closest
we came to having a pet.

719
00:42:08,577 --> 00:42:13,014
Buck tried to talk you
into getting a dog.

720
00:42:13,083 --> 00:42:17,518
He said. "If it's the size
of a football?"

721
00:42:17,585 --> 00:42:20,521
You know.
That animal next door...

722
00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:22,581
that Pepper or Pippin...

723
00:42:22,659 --> 00:42:24,456
Pippin. Pippin. Pippin.

724
00:42:24,527 --> 00:42:26,289
He's not friendly...

725
00:42:26,362 --> 00:42:28,831
whatever Mr. McGreary says.

726
00:42:28,898 --> 00:42:30,989
He wanted the retriever.

727
00:42:31,067 --> 00:42:33,934
Each time that dog comes here.
I try to get him out.

728
00:42:34,003 --> 00:42:35,130
Arf!

729
00:42:35,204 --> 00:42:36,728
Arf! Arf!

730
00:42:40,210 --> 00:42:43,577
Put that on
if you're staying out here.

731
00:43:22,585 --> 00:43:24,710
Can I help?

732
00:43:24,788 --> 00:43:26,221
With this?

733
00:43:26,289 --> 00:43:28,382
No.

734
00:43:28,458 --> 00:43:29,481
I will.

735
00:43:29,559 --> 00:43:32,322
You can go to your room...

736
00:43:32,393 --> 00:43:34,260
and clean the closet.

737
00:43:34,329 --> 00:43:36,230
Mom.

738
00:43:36,297 --> 00:43:38,324
Okay?

739
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:41,164
Because it's really a mess.

Oh. Hi.

I didn't get there.

Mary Ann Ramon started
just to scream. Right?

752
00:44:17,838 --> 00:44:20,773
We got so drunk.
We couldn't talk.

753
00:44:20,842 --> 00:44:24,039
It was the last day of school.

No. Stop!

00:44:37,326 --> 00:44:38,849
We just don't connect.

That I jack off a lot.

763
00:44:59,347 --> 00:45:01,315
So what else is new?

00:45:01,382 --> 00:45:02,815

He didn't
know what to say.

00:45:36,418 --> 00:45:38,851
He put his
arm around me.

774
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:41,786
We just sat there.

775
00:45:41,856 --> 00:45:43,791
I remember watching his shoe.
And thinking...

776
00:45:47,362 --> 00:45:50,297
His shoe was turned
over on its side.

777
00:45:50,364 --> 00:45:54,664
I was thinking. He's so uptight!
It's gonna crack off.

778
00:45:57,672 --> 00:46:00,005
I knew I should've
felt something.

I didn't know what to feel.

On TV. They say stuff
like. "Oh. No!"

But I didn't say that...

782
00:46:10,385 --> 00:46:13,320
because I didn't feel sad...

So much as what?

would've said something...

about how he felt.

787

00:50:25,340 --> 00:50:26,864
What do you want?

852
00:50:26,942 --> 00:50:30,378
I don't know
what else to do.

853
00:50:30,445 --> 00:50:32,878
I'm not asking for anything.

854
00:50:32,947 --> 00:50:34,380
You're kidding me.

855
00:50:34,449 --> 00:50:36,882
I don't get it.

856
00:50:36,952 --> 00:50:38,885
You're excused from practice...

857
00:50:38,954 --> 00:50:40,818
to see some shrink;

858
00:50:40,889 --> 00:50:44,324
I work with you
at your convenience.

859
00:50:44,391 --> 00:50:46,724
What more should I do?

860
00:50:46,795 --> 00:50:48,820
Nothing.

861
00:50:48,896 --> 00:50:51,730
A bright kid like you.

862
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:53,768
I don't get it.

863
00:50:53,835 --> 00:50:56,804
Why keep messing up your life?

864
00:50:56,871 --> 00:51:00,170
I don't think that
quitting swimming...

865
00:51:00,239 --> 00:51:02,766
will mess up my life.

866
00:51:07,916 --> 00:51:09,746
Okay.

867
00:51:09,818 --> 00:51:13,047
Okay. Now. This is it.

868
00:51:13,121 --> 00:51:14,213
Yeah.

869
00:51:14,289 --> 00:51:16,085
You're a big kid.

870
00:51:16,157 --> 00:51:18,021
Actions have consequences.

871
00:51:18,092 --> 00:51:20,253
I'm not taking you back.

872
00:51:20,327 --> 00:51:21,726
I won't ask you to.

873
00:51:31,873 --> 00:51:33,806
[Laughing]

874
00:51:44,885 --> 00:51:46,820
What happened?
You all right?

875
00:51:46,887 --> 00:51:48,184
Yeah.

876
00:51:48,255 --> 00:51:49,813
You quit the swim team.

877
00:51:49,891 --> 00:51:51,324
Yeah.

878
00:51:51,393 --> 00:51:52,826
Why?

879
00:51:52,893 --> 00:51:54,327
It was a bore.

880
00:51:54,396 --> 00:51:57,331
That's no reason!

881
00:51:57,398 --> 00:51:58,831
What's going on?

882
00:51:58,900 --> 00:52:00,333
Nothing.

883
00:52:00,402 --> 00:52:01,835
Talk to me.

884
00:52:01,902 --> 00:52:03,835
Swimming's a bore. That's all.

885
00:52:03,905 --> 00:52:04,835
I talked to...

886
00:52:04,905 --> 00:52:06,668
Quit talking to people!

887
00:52:06,742 --> 00:52:08,333
Okay?

888
00:52:08,409 --> 00:52:10,344
Holy shit.

889
00:52:10,411 --> 00:52:12,346
Yeah. Sure.

890
00:52:12,414 --> 00:52:14,347
Fuck you. Jarrett.

891
00:52:14,416 --> 00:52:16,349
Ooh! Ohh!

892
00:52:16,418 --> 00:52:17,851
Shut up.

893
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:20,353
Leave it alone.

894
00:52:20,422 --> 00:52:23,356
I told you. The guy's a flake.

895
00:52:28,230 --> 00:52:31,289
- What did your dad say?
- I haven't told him.

896
00:52:31,364 --> 00:52:32,922
How come?

897
00:52:33,001 --> 00:52:35,094
The timing isn't right.

898
00:52:35,170 --> 00:52:36,693
He sweats everything.

899
00:52:36,771 --> 00:52:38,864
He'll just get worried.

900
00:52:38,940 --> 00:52:40,873
Can you tell your mother?

901
00:52:40,942 --> 00:52:42,306
My mother?

902
00:52:42,376 --> 00:52:44,811
I told you we don't connect.

903
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:48,315
What do people have
in common with mothers anyway?

904
00:52:48,382 --> 00:52:49,815
It's all surface junk.

905
00:52:49,885 --> 00:52:51,318
You know?

906
00:52:51,385 --> 00:52:53,320
"Clean your room.
Brush your teeth...

907
00:52:53,387 --> 00:52:54,911
get good grades."

908
00:52:56,724 --> 00:52:59,353
I'm not feeling anything today.

909
00:52:59,427 --> 00:53:00,952
I'm sorry.

910
00:53:01,027 --> 00:53:02,585
No. Sorry's out.

911
00:53:02,664 --> 00:53:04,757
Something's on your mind.

912
00:53:04,833 --> 00:53:06,322
What time is it?

913
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:07,833
Never mind. There's time.

914
00:53:09,137 --> 00:53:11,230
Remember the contract?
Control?

915
00:53:11,306 --> 00:53:13,364
Maybe there's some connection...

916
00:53:13,442 --> 00:53:16,605
between control
and lack of feeling.

917
00:53:16,677 --> 00:53:18,612
I said I feel things.

918
00:53:18,679 --> 00:53:19,840
When?

919
00:53:19,914 --> 00:53:21,347
Come on.

920
00:53:23,418 --> 00:53:24,349
When?

921
00:53:24,418 --> 00:53:26,079
Sometimes. I don't know.

922
00:53:26,152 --> 00:53:29,851
I thought you didn't
like fooling around.

923
00:53:29,925 --> 00:53:31,619
What do you want?

924
00:53:31,693 --> 00:53:34,489
Don't say. "I don't know."

925
00:53:34,563 --> 00:53:37,030
Should I make up answers?

926
00:53:37,097 --> 00:53:40,157
Make one up about
there's no feelings there.

927
00:53:40,235 --> 00:53:41,668
I have feelings.

928
00:53:41,735 --> 00:53:43,293
Get it together. Jarrett.

929
00:53:43,371 --> 00:53:46,534
You're trying to make me mad.

930
00:53:46,608 --> 00:53:48,041
Are you mad?

931
00:53:48,108 --> 00:53:49,804
No!

932
00:53:49,878 --> 00:53:51,811
You don't like being pushed.

933
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:53,313
Do something about it!

934
00:53:53,380 --> 00:53:54,313
What?

935
00:53:54,382 --> 00:53:56,315
No. I can't do this.

936
00:53:56,384 --> 00:53:58,079
Why not?

937
00:53:58,152 --> 00:53:59,847
Getting mad takes too much energy.

938
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:02,320
It takes more holding it back.

939
00:54:02,389 --> 00:54:05,847
When I let myself feel.
I feel lousy.

940
00:54:05,927 --> 00:54:08,862
# I never promised you
a rose garden #

941
00:54:08,929 --> 00:54:10,192
Fuck you. Berger.

942
00:54:10,264 --> 00:54:11,731
Fuck you.

943
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:12,731
Yeah?

944
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:14,496
That's it.

945
00:54:14,568 --> 00:54:17,469
What do you feel?
Do you jack off?

946
00:54:17,539 --> 00:54:19,507
What do you think?

947
00:54:19,574 --> 00:54:21,838
You married a fat lady...

948
00:54:21,909 --> 00:54:24,344
and you fuck
the daylights out of her!

949
00:54:24,411 --> 00:54:26,003
Sounds good to me.

950
00:54:39,893 --> 00:54:41,954
Little advice
about feeling...

951
00:54:42,030 --> 00:54:44,463
Don't expect it always to tickle.

952
00:54:47,536 --> 00:54:50,164
Do you know how
to aim that?

953
00:54:50,237 --> 00:54:52,967
Be quiet. I have to concentrate.

954
00:54:53,041 --> 00:54:54,507
Be quiet.

955
00:54:54,576 --> 00:54:56,543
Is it in focus?

956
00:54:56,610 --> 00:54:58,579
Smile. Smile.
Okay. Good.

957
00:54:58,646 --> 00:55:02,639
I want to take
the three young ones.

958
00:55:02,717 --> 00:55:05,184
Dad. Get out of there.

959
00:55:05,253 --> 00:55:06,550
All right.

960
00:55:06,621 --> 00:55:08,088
Connie.

961
00:55:08,155 --> 00:55:09,623
Be quiet.

962
00:55:09,690 --> 00:55:11,659
Conrad. Where are you?

963
00:55:11,726 --> 00:55:14,193
Between your mother and father.

964
00:55:14,262 --> 00:55:17,231
You're taller than
your mother is!

965
00:55:17,297 --> 00:55:19,699
Will you be quiet?

966
00:55:19,768 --> 00:55:21,132
This is beautiful.

967
00:55:21,202 --> 00:55:22,829
Shut up.

968
00:55:22,902 --> 00:55:24,371
Wonderful.

969
00:55:24,438 --> 00:55:26,407
Now Cal and Beth.

970
00:55:26,474 --> 00:55:27,440
Sure.

971
00:55:27,509 --> 00:55:29,373
Go on.

972
00:55:29,443 --> 00:55:32,572
You can do better than that.

973
00:55:32,646 --> 00:55:35,844
I want one of Connie and Beth.

974
00:55:35,916 --> 00:55:39,409
Let's get the three men in there.

975
00:55:39,487 --> 00:55:41,978
Move closer to your mother.

976
00:55:42,056 --> 00:55:42,989
Prize winner.

977
00:55:43,056 --> 00:55:44,855
Yeah. That's great.

978
00:55:44,925 --> 00:55:46,291
Do it.

979
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:47,793
Isn't it marvelous?

980
00:55:47,862 --> 00:55:49,295
Yes. It is.

981
00:55:49,364 --> 00:55:51,264
It isn't cocked.

982
00:55:51,333 --> 00:55:52,731
Calvin.

983
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:54,996
Hold it. Connie. Smile.

984
00:55:55,070 --> 00:55:56,867
Calvin!

985
00:55:56,938 --> 00:55:58,132
Smile.

986
00:55:58,206 --> 00:56:00,297
Give me the camera.

987
00:56:00,375 --> 00:56:01,864
Give me the camera.

988
00:56:01,943 --> 00:56:05,106
I want a really good picture.

989
00:56:05,179 --> 00:56:08,512
I want a shot of you three men.

990
00:56:08,583 --> 00:56:11,574
Not until I get you two.

991
00:56:11,652 --> 00:56:14,315
Give her
the goddamn camera!

992
00:56:30,704 --> 00:56:32,730
Smile.

993
00:56:36,677 --> 00:56:39,670
Who's hungry?
I'll make the sandwiches.

994
00:56:44,219 --> 00:56:46,119
[Crash]

995
00:56:52,626 --> 00:56:54,094
Beth!

996
00:56:55,195 --> 00:56:57,164
It can be saved.

997
00:57:00,335 --> 00:57:02,826
That was so dumb.

998
00:57:06,875 --> 00:57:10,003
I don't think
he's happy in school.

999
00:57:12,681 --> 00:57:15,114
Have you talked to his teachers?

1000
00:57:15,181 --> 00:57:18,242
People don't want
to be with him.

1001
00:57:18,318 --> 00:57:19,786
He provokes people.

1002
00:57:19,853 --> 00:57:22,344
Well. It's an awkward age.

1003
00:57:22,422 --> 00:57:23,891
Thank you.

1004
00:57:24,992 --> 00:57:27,483
Maybe he needs a change.

1005
00:57:27,561 --> 00:57:29,552
Is he eating enough?

1006
00:57:29,630 --> 00:57:31,496
Yes. Mother.

1007
00:57:31,565 --> 00:57:33,534
He'll be all right.

1008
00:57:33,601 --> 00:57:36,034
If you're firm with him.

1009
00:57:36,103 --> 00:57:40,039
I think he should
go away to school.

1010
00:57:40,108 --> 00:57:42,541
I can't deal with him.

1011
00:57:42,610 --> 00:57:44,771
Who'd make that decision?

1012
00:57:44,846 --> 00:57:49,043
I suppose this doctor he's seeing.

1013
00:57:50,117 --> 00:57:51,277
What sort of doctor...

1014
00:57:51,351 --> 00:57:53,684
would make that decision for you?

1015
00:57:53,755 --> 00:57:55,188
A psychiatrist.

1016
00:57:55,255 --> 00:57:57,690
I thought that was finished.

1017
00:57:57,759 --> 00:57:59,282
No.

1018
00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:01,293
What's his name?

1019
00:58:01,362 --> 00:58:03,295
Berger.

1020
00:58:03,364 --> 00:58:05,297
Jewish doctor?

1021
00:58:05,364 --> 00:58:07,300
I suppose he's Jewish.

1022
00:58:07,367 --> 00:58:09,802
Maybe just German.

1023
00:58:09,871 --> 00:58:12,806
What does Cal say
about all this?

1024
00:58:14,876 --> 00:58:16,309
This can be saved.

1025
00:58:16,376 --> 00:58:19,072
It's a nice clean break.

1026
00:58:19,146 --> 00:58:22,411
# Amen. Amen. Alleluia #

1027
00:58:22,483 --> 00:58:24,952
# Amen #

1028
00:58:25,018 --> 00:58:32,255
# Amen ##

1029
00:58:32,327 --> 00:58:33,760
Okay.

1030
00:58:33,827 --> 00:58:37,264
That last "E" natural
could be higher.

1031
00:58:37,331 --> 00:58:40,233
Officers. Don't forget
your meeting tonight.

1032
00:58:46,007 --> 00:58:47,440
# Mmm mm mmm #

1033
00:58:47,509 --> 00:58:49,500
# Mmm mm mmm #

1034
00:58:49,577 --> 00:58:51,271
# Mmm mmm #

1035
00:58:51,346 --> 00:58:53,108
# Mmm mm mmm #

1036
00:59:00,487 --> 00:59:01,920
Hi. Jeannine.

1037
00:59:01,989 --> 00:59:04,481
You're really a terrific tenor.

1038
00:59:04,559 --> 00:59:08,050
In fact. You should be
doing the solo.

1039
00:59:08,128 --> 00:59:10,097
No. L...

1040
00:59:10,164 --> 00:59:11,632
No. I'm serious.

1041
00:59:11,699 --> 00:59:13,166
You sing well.

1042
00:59:13,233 --> 00:59:16,226
I'm getting to know your voice.

1043
00:59:16,304 --> 00:59:19,795
How can you hear me
if you're singing?

1044
00:59:19,873 --> 00:59:21,340
Well...

1045
00:59:21,409 --> 00:59:23,376
I don't always sing.

1046
00:59:23,443 --> 00:59:25,434
Sometimes I just listen.

1047
00:59:25,512 --> 00:59:29,505
For instance. Marcia Blair
can't sing a note.

1048
00:59:29,583 --> 00:59:33,543
Janet Fox mouths the words
and never sings.

1049
00:59:33,621 --> 00:59:35,143
A detective.

1050
00:59:35,222 --> 00:59:36,746
[Jeannine]
Do you like Vivaldi?

1051
00:59:36,824 --> 00:59:39,259
Telemann?

1052
00:59:39,327 --> 00:59:40,918
[Conrad]
Telemann? Um...

1053
00:59:40,994 --> 00:59:43,998
What kind of music do you like?

1054
00:59:44,130 --> 00:59:45,393
Oh. Uh...

1055
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:48,467
Modern jazz. I like.

1056
00:59:48,534 --> 00:59:51,992
Folk rock. Spoon on a glass.

1057
00:59:52,072 --> 00:59:55,063
Spoon on a glass?

1058
01:00:00,047 --> 01:00:03,539
Oh. You mean.
Like. Table spoons?

1059
01:00:05,119 --> 01:00:06,585
Oh. Dear.

1060
01:00:08,688 --> 01:00:11,657
Why do I ask dumb questions?

1061
01:00:11,724 --> 01:00:13,693
I'm just showing off.

1062
01:00:18,331 --> 01:00:20,800
Why is it so hard...

1063
01:00:20,867 --> 01:00:23,802
the first time you talk
to somebody?

1064
01:00:23,871 --> 01:00:25,804
You make it look easy.

1065
01:00:28,509 --> 01:00:29,976
Really?

1066
01:00:32,012 --> 01:00:35,811
That's my bus.
I got to go.

1067
01:00:35,882 --> 01:00:37,851
I'll see you later!

1068
01:00:39,385 --> 01:00:41,820
You're really a terrific tenor.

1069
01:00:43,356 --> 01:00:45,655
# Ah. You're
just saying that #

1070
01:00:55,469 --> 01:00:57,300
# Alleluia #

1071
01:00:59,373 --> 01:01:01,568
# Alleluia #

01:01:01,641 --> 01:01:03,541

01:01:03,610 --> 01:01:05,601

1076
01:01:12,219 --> 01:01:14,050

# Alleluia ##

1083
01:01:42,382 --> 01:01:43,746
Hello.

1084
01:01:43,817 --> 01:01:45,284
Is Karen there?

1085
01:01:45,351 --> 01:01:46,818
Who's calling?

1086
01:01:46,887 --> 01:01:49,856
A friend of hers from Hillsboro.

1087
01:01:49,922 --> 01:01:51,550
Oh.

1088
01:01:51,625 --> 01:01:54,594
She's not home from school yet.

1089
01:01:54,661 --> 01:01:56,288
Oh. Um...

1090
01:01:56,362 --> 01:01:58,831
Hmm. Tell her I called.

1091
01:01:58,898 --> 01:02:00,364
This is Conrad.

1092
01:02:00,434 --> 01:02:02,902
Tell her I'm feeling great...

1093
01:02:02,969 --> 01:02:05,960
and I wanted to talk to her.

1094
01:02:06,039 --> 01:02:07,472
Yes. I will.

1095
01:02:07,541 --> 01:02:08,565
Thank you.

1096
01:02:49,717 --> 01:02:52,184
Hello. Jeannine.
This is Conrad.

1097
01:02:52,253 --> 01:02:55,416
Hello. Jeannine.
This is Conrad.

1098
01:03:03,963 --> 01:03:07,023
Hello. Jeannine.
This is Conrad.

1099
01:03:07,101 --> 01:03:08,795
Conrad.

1100
01:03:08,869 --> 01:03:10,199
Conrad?

1101
01:03:10,271 --> 01:03:12,068
What a dumb name.

1102
01:03:12,139 --> 01:03:15,905
Hello. Jeannine.
This is Bill.

1103
01:03:15,976 --> 01:03:17,237
Uuuuugh!

1104
01:03:22,416 --> 01:03:23,882
Hello.

1105
01:03:23,951 --> 01:03:26,351
Hello. This is...

1106
01:03:26,420 --> 01:03:28,353
Hello. This is Conrad calling.

1107
01:03:28,422 --> 01:03:29,855
Jarrett.

1108
01:03:29,922 --> 01:03:31,289
Oh.

1109
01:03:31,358 --> 01:03:33,291
Oh. Hi!

1110
01:03:33,360 --> 01:03:34,793
Listen. I was...

1111
01:03:34,862 --> 01:03:37,797
I was wondering
if maybe you'd like...

1112
01:03:37,864 --> 01:03:39,297
to go out sometime.

1113
01:03:39,364 --> 01:03:41,300
Like on a date?

1114
01:03:41,367 --> 01:03:44,804
We wouldn't have
to call it a date.

1115
01:03:44,871 --> 01:03:47,306
We could see how it goes.

1116
01:03:47,373 --> 01:03:51,309
That was dumb.
Now start over.

1117
01:03:51,378 --> 01:03:52,811
This is Conrad Jarrett.

1118
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:54,608
I'd love to. When?

1119
01:04:29,083 --> 01:04:30,811
I didn't see you.

1120
01:04:30,884 --> 01:04:32,646
What do you think?

1121
01:04:32,719 --> 01:04:33,981
Fine.

1122
01:04:34,054 --> 01:04:36,851
Rawlins used to have
great scotch pines.

1123
01:04:36,922 --> 01:04:40,621
They look like
skeletons this year.

1124
01:04:40,693 --> 01:04:43,184
Hi. What do you think?

1125
01:04:45,364 --> 01:04:47,630
It's very nice.

1126
01:04:49,168 --> 01:04:50,601
What is wrong?

1127
01:04:50,670 --> 01:04:52,103
Ask him what's wrong.

1128
01:04:52,172 --> 01:04:55,902
Maybe you won't have to
hear it from Carol Lazenby.

1129
01:04:55,976 --> 01:04:57,375
Hear what?

1130
01:05:01,081 --> 01:05:03,547
I quit the swim team.

1131
01:05:03,617 --> 01:05:05,777
Carol thought I knew.

1132
01:05:05,853 --> 01:05:08,822
It happened over a month ago.

1133
01:05:08,889 --> 01:05:10,288
Quit? When?

1134
01:05:11,358 --> 01:05:14,018
Where have you been every night?

1135
01:05:14,094 --> 01:05:16,027
Nowhere.
The library mostly.

1136
01:05:16,096 --> 01:05:18,826
I didn't think it mattered.

1137
01:05:18,898 --> 01:05:21,333
That was meant for me.

1138
01:05:21,402 --> 01:05:24,632
It's important to hurt me. Right?

1139
01:05:24,704 --> 01:05:26,605
You have that backwards.

1140
01:05:26,672 --> 01:05:30,632
Do I embarrass you
in front of friends?

1141
01:05:30,710 --> 01:05:34,704
"Poor Beth believes
every lie her son tells."

1142
01:05:34,782 --> 01:05:36,271
I didn't lie.

1143
01:05:36,349 --> 01:05:40,376
You did when
you came home at 6:30!

1144
01:05:40,454 --> 01:05:44,514
If the lying's starting again.
I can't stand it!

1145
01:05:44,590 --> 01:05:46,855
Then go to Europe!

1146
01:05:46,927 --> 01:05:52,297
She only gives a fuck because
someone else knew about it first!

1147
01:05:52,364 --> 01:05:55,699
She never came
to the hospital...

1148
01:05:55,768 --> 01:05:59,295
because she's busy going
to goddamn Spain and Portugal!

1149
01:05:59,373 --> 01:06:03,867
She doesn't care if I'm hung up
by the balls out there.

1150
01:06:03,943 --> 01:06:06,742
They may talk like this
at the hospital...

1151
01:06:06,813 --> 01:06:09,338
but we're not at the hospital.

1152
01:06:09,416 --> 01:06:11,849
You never came to the hospital!

1153
01:06:11,918 --> 01:06:14,614
She had the flu
and couldn't come inside.

1154
01:06:14,688 --> 01:06:17,657
She would've visited Buck
in the hospital!

1155
01:06:17,724 --> 01:06:20,626
Buck never would've been
in the hospital!

1156
01:06:20,693 --> 01:06:22,355
That is enough!

1157
01:06:22,429 --> 01:06:25,159
I won't do it again.

1158
01:06:25,231 --> 01:06:27,826
What in hell has happened?

1159
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:30,425
Somebody better go up there.

1160
01:06:30,503 --> 01:06:32,869
He walks all over us...

1161
01:06:32,940 --> 01:06:36,103
then you apologize to him.

1162
01:06:36,175 --> 01:06:37,905
You've been apologizing to him...

1163
01:06:37,978 --> 01:06:41,072
since he returned from the hospital!

1164
01:06:41,148 --> 01:06:44,606
I'm trying to
goddamn understand him!

1165
01:06:44,684 --> 01:06:46,311
Don't talk to me...

1166
01:06:46,385 --> 01:06:48,945
the way he talks to you.

1167
01:06:49,021 --> 01:06:51,489
Let's not fight. Okay?

1168
01:06:51,556 --> 01:06:53,114
No fighting. Okay?

1169
01:06:53,193 --> 01:06:55,092
Please.

1170
01:06:55,161 --> 01:06:56,789
Let's go upstairs.

1171
01:07:15,916 --> 01:07:18,315
I want to talk to you.

1172
01:07:18,385 --> 01:07:20,945
I didn't mean any of it.

1173
01:07:21,021 --> 01:07:23,215
Please don't be mad.

1174
01:07:23,289 --> 01:07:26,157
I'm trying to
understand what happened.

1175
01:07:26,226 --> 01:07:28,717
I don't know what happened.

1176
01:07:28,795 --> 01:07:30,730
I didn't mean it.

1177
01:07:30,797 --> 01:07:33,960
Tell her I'm sorry. Will you?

1178
01:07:34,034 --> 01:07:35,126
Why don't you?

1179
01:07:35,202 --> 01:07:36,965
God. I can't!

1180
01:07:37,036 --> 01:07:39,505
I can't talk to her!

1181
01:07:39,572 --> 01:07:41,039
Why not?

1182
01:07:41,108 --> 01:07:43,099
It doesn't change anything.

1183
01:07:43,177 --> 01:07:47,704
It doesn't change
the way she looks at me.

1184
01:07:47,780 --> 01:07:51,806
She was hurt because
you quit the team.

1185
01:07:51,885 --> 01:07:54,353
I don't mean just now.

1186
01:07:54,420 --> 01:07:56,911
I don't mean just today.

1187
01:07:56,989 --> 01:07:58,980
Explain it to me.

1188
01:07:59,059 --> 01:08:02,050
I can't. You don't see things.

1189
01:08:02,128 --> 01:08:03,594
What things?

1190
01:08:03,663 --> 01:08:05,291
What things?

1191
01:08:05,364 --> 01:08:08,356
I want you to tell me.

1192
01:08:08,434 --> 01:08:11,527
Can't you see she hates me?

1193
01:08:11,603 --> 01:08:13,505
She doesn't hate you.

1194
01:08:13,572 --> 01:08:16,099
You're right.
She doesn't.

1195
01:08:16,176 --> 01:08:18,167
Please leave me alone.

1196
01:08:30,988 --> 01:08:34,448
Do you think Dr. Berger's helping you?

1197
01:08:34,528 --> 01:08:36,393
It's not his fault.

1198
01:08:42,536 --> 01:08:45,505
I'll be downstairs if you need me.

1199
01:08:49,943 --> 01:08:53,935
Tuesday everything was hunky-dory.

1200
01:08:54,014 --> 01:08:55,447
You're the doctor.

1201
01:08:58,452 --> 01:09:01,386
Don't take refuge
in one-liners. Okay?

1202
01:09:01,453 --> 01:09:03,389
Because that pisses me off.

1203
01:09:03,457 --> 01:09:05,890
Okay. Okay.

1204
01:09:05,957 --> 01:09:07,390
Everything was fine...

1205
01:09:07,461 --> 01:09:10,395
till you had the fight
with your mother?

1206
01:09:10,462 --> 01:09:11,895
I don't blame her.

1207
01:09:11,965 --> 01:09:14,399
She's got her reasons.
It's impossible...

1208
01:09:14,466 --> 01:09:16,402
after all the shit I've pulled.

1209
01:09:16,470 --> 01:09:18,404
What shit have you pulled?

1210
01:09:20,974 --> 01:09:23,340
I'm talking about proportion.

1211
01:09:23,408 --> 01:09:25,310
Now. What shit?

1212
01:09:28,381 --> 01:09:32,341
You can find one example.

1213
01:09:32,417 --> 01:09:34,353
Don't say you tried suicide.

1214
01:09:34,421 --> 01:09:36,354
What have you done lately?

1215
01:09:36,421 --> 01:09:40,051
I'll never be forgiven for that.

1216
01:09:40,127 --> 01:09:41,617
Never.

1217
01:09:41,694 --> 01:09:45,791
You can't get out
the blood in her towels...

1218
01:09:45,863 --> 01:09:47,890
and in her rug.

1219
01:09:47,966 --> 01:09:50,493
Everything
had to be pitched.

1220
01:09:50,569 --> 01:09:54,162
The bathroom tile
had to be regrouted.

1221
01:09:54,238 --> 01:09:55,970
She fired the maid...

1222
01:09:56,042 --> 01:09:58,876
because she couldn't dust right.

1223
01:09:58,944 --> 01:10:01,470
If you think I'll forgive...

1224
01:10:01,546 --> 01:10:03,037
she's gonna forgive me...

1225
01:10:11,055 --> 01:10:12,216
What?

1226
01:10:32,310 --> 01:10:36,078
I think I just figured
something out.

1227
01:10:36,149 --> 01:10:37,613
What?

1228
01:10:39,219 --> 01:10:41,653
Who it is who can't forgive who.

1229
01:10:46,926 --> 01:10:50,363
[Berger]
A real problem has a real solution.

1230
01:10:50,430 --> 01:10:52,421
[Conrad]
I've heard this before.

1231
01:10:52,497 --> 01:10:55,524
Doesn't make it any less true.

1232
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:57,091
I'm so tired.

1233
01:10:57,171 --> 01:11:00,197
That's some secret
you've been keeping.

1234
01:11:00,274 --> 01:11:03,300
So what do I do now?

1235
01:11:04,912 --> 01:11:06,935
Recognize her limitations.

1236
01:11:08,046 --> 01:11:10,537
Like she can't love me.

1237
01:11:10,617 --> 01:11:14,551
No. Like she can't
love you enough.

1238
01:11:14,621 --> 01:11:17,783
Don't blame her
for not loving you...

1239
01:11:17,858 --> 01:11:19,849
more than she's able.

1240
01:11:19,926 --> 01:11:21,917
She loves my father.

1241
01:11:21,993 --> 01:11:23,984
She loved my brother.

1242
01:11:24,064 --> 01:11:25,725
It's me.

1243
01:11:25,796 --> 01:11:28,893
We're back to
the rotten kid routine.

1244
01:11:28,969 --> 01:11:32,801
She can't love you
because you're unlovable.

1245
01:11:32,872 --> 01:11:35,966
How come your Dad loves you?

1246
01:11:36,042 --> 01:11:38,511
He feels responsible.

1247
01:11:38,578 --> 01:11:40,569
Besides. He loves everybody.

1248
01:11:40,645 --> 01:11:43,171
The guy's got no taste.

1249
01:11:43,250 --> 01:11:46,242
He loves you. But he's wrong.

1250
01:11:46,319 --> 01:11:47,787
Look...

1251
01:11:47,854 --> 01:11:50,845
maybe she can't express it...

1252
01:11:50,921 --> 01:11:52,890
the way you'd like.

1253
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:56,225
Maybe she's afraid
to show her feelings.

1254
01:11:56,296 --> 01:11:58,524
What do you mean?

1255
01:11:58,599 --> 01:12:00,930
There's someone
besides your mother...

1256
01:12:01,001 --> 01:12:02,591
you've got to forgive.

1257
01:12:02,667 --> 01:12:04,430
You mean me?

1258
01:12:06,305 --> 01:12:08,831
For trying to off myself?

1259
01:12:10,978 --> 01:12:12,969
Don't stare.
What for?

1260
01:12:13,046 --> 01:12:16,979
Why don't you let yourself
off the hook?

1261
01:12:17,050 --> 01:12:20,076
What did I do?

1262
01:12:20,153 --> 01:12:21,743
What did I do?

1263
01:12:21,822 --> 01:12:23,287
We'll talk Thursday.

1264
01:12:23,354 --> 01:12:24,287
Come on!

1265
01:12:24,358 --> 01:12:26,087
Time's up.

1266
01:12:26,158 --> 01:12:28,591
What did I do?

1267
01:12:28,662 --> 01:12:30,060
You know the rules.

1268
01:12:30,130 --> 01:12:31,618
What rules?

1269
01:12:31,698 --> 01:12:33,393
Think about it.

1270
01:12:33,466 --> 01:12:35,059
Just think about it.

1271
01:12:38,203 --> 01:12:39,466
Jesus!

1272
01:12:43,676 --> 01:12:46,237
Say. After going to a new high...

1273
01:12:46,313 --> 01:12:48,679
it falls to 1121/4...

1274
01:12:48,747 --> 01:12:51,738
and then rallies on good volume.

1275
01:12:51,818 --> 01:12:54,252
I order to buy 4.000.

1276
01:12:54,319 --> 01:12:58,587
If I get the 4.000 at 1133/4.
I know something's wrong.

1277
01:12:58,658 --> 01:13:02,595
But suppose I order
to buy the 4.000 shares...

1278
01:13:02,662 --> 01:13:05,529
and I plug in at 1133/4...

1279
01:13:05,599 --> 01:13:09,466
I get 2.000 at 114.
500 at 1141/4...

1280
01:13:09,536 --> 01:13:12,403
and the rest on the way up.

1281
01:13:12,470 --> 01:13:14,497
Then I know I'm right.

1282
01:13:14,573 --> 01:13:17,439
I'm going to peel off here.

1283
01:13:17,511 --> 01:13:19,444
See you later.

1284
01:13:24,184 --> 01:13:26,810
[Voice Echoing]
Suppose the order to buy...

1285
01:13:26,886 --> 01:13:28,819
[Beth's Voice]
You let him walk all over us...

1286
01:13:28,889 --> 01:13:30,149
and you apologize.

1287
01:13:30,220 --> 01:13:31,884
[Man's Voice]
500 at 114...

1288
01:13:31,957 --> 01:13:33,926
[Conrad's Voice]
Dad, you don't see things.

1289
01:13:33,993 --> 01:13:35,791
[Beth]
You've been apologizing...

1290
01:13:35,862 --> 01:13:39,161
since he returned from the hospital.

1291
01:13:39,229 --> 01:13:41,166
Tell her to stop it!

1292
01:13:41,234 --> 01:13:44,292
Buck never would've
been in the hospital!

1293
01:13:44,371 --> 01:13:45,702
She hates me!

1294
01:14:07,993 --> 01:14:09,724
I want to be clear.

1295
01:14:09,796 --> 01:14:11,591
That's good.

1296
01:14:13,500 --> 01:14:18,095
In the car.
I was thinking. "be clear."

1297
01:14:21,506 --> 01:14:23,942
I suppose that's what
psychiatry's about.

1298
01:14:24,011 --> 01:14:26,411
Being precise and clear.

1299
01:14:26,479 --> 01:14:28,448
And honest, of course.

1300
01:14:29,850 --> 01:14:33,809
I'm not a great believer
in psychiatry.

1301
01:14:33,886 --> 01:14:35,613
Okay.

1302
01:14:35,689 --> 01:14:39,318
What happens here
is between you and him...

1303
01:14:39,393 --> 01:14:41,384
and I respect that.

1304
01:14:41,461 --> 01:14:43,895
He's better.
I can see that.

1305
01:14:43,962 --> 01:14:46,761
I just don't believe in psychiatry...

1306
01:14:46,832 --> 01:14:50,095
as a panacea for everybody.

1307
01:14:50,170 --> 01:14:51,636
Neither do I.

1308
01:14:54,608 --> 01:14:59,170
I wish I knew what
I was doing here.

1309
01:14:59,246 --> 01:15:03,203
You said you could shed
some light on some things.

1310
01:15:03,283 --> 01:15:06,844
I meant in terms of Conrad.

1311
01:15:06,920 --> 01:15:09,411
I knew something was wrong...

1312
01:15:09,488 --> 01:15:11,979
even before he tried suicide.

1313
01:15:12,059 --> 01:15:14,027
But I thought that...

1314
01:15:15,127 --> 01:15:18,118
It's clear that he's very smart.

1315
01:15:18,198 --> 01:15:21,189
He's always been
an "A" student.

1316
01:15:21,268 --> 01:15:23,759
Naturally. I thought
intelligent people...

1317
01:15:23,837 --> 01:15:26,237
could work out their problems.

1318
01:15:26,305 --> 01:15:28,899
But you still feel responsible?

1319
01:15:28,975 --> 01:15:31,000
Yeah, sure I do.

1320
01:15:31,078 --> 01:15:33,103
It's hard not to.

1321
01:15:33,180 --> 01:15:37,742
It was just luck that
I happened to be there...

1322
01:15:37,818 --> 01:15:39,786
when he tried it.

1323
01:15:39,853 --> 01:15:42,546
We both could've been away.

1324
01:15:42,622 --> 01:15:46,613
You think of yourself
as a lucky man?

1325
01:15:46,693 --> 01:15:48,180
No. No. No.

1326
01:15:48,261 --> 01:15:53,287
I used to think that
I was a lucky person...

1327
01:15:53,363 --> 01:15:55,027
before the accident.

1328
01:15:59,706 --> 01:16:02,729
I guess the whole of life...

1329
01:16:02,809 --> 01:16:05,277
is nothing but an accident...

1330
01:16:05,345 --> 01:16:07,210
what happens to you.

1331
01:16:07,279 --> 01:16:10,215
That sounds like
the philosophy of a drifter.

1332
01:16:10,283 --> 01:16:12,113
Yeah. Maybe.

1333
01:16:12,185 --> 01:16:14,515
Maybe I am drifting a little.

1334
01:16:14,587 --> 01:16:18,113
I can see the two of them...

1335
01:16:18,189 --> 01:16:20,180
drifting away from me...

1336
01:16:20,260 --> 01:16:22,783
and I just stand watching.

1337
01:16:22,863 --> 01:16:27,027
What would you want
to do about that?

1338
01:16:27,100 --> 01:16:29,591
Something.
I don't know what.

1339
01:16:29,667 --> 01:16:33,127
I feel like
I'm sitting on a fence.

1340
01:16:33,206 --> 01:16:36,229
They're on opposite sides
of this fence?

1341
01:16:36,309 --> 01:16:39,037
Yeah... No.

1342
01:16:39,112 --> 01:16:40,305
I don't know.

1343
01:16:40,380 --> 01:16:44,942
I see her not being able
to forgive him.

1344
01:16:46,019 --> 01:16:47,542
For what?

1345
01:16:47,621 --> 01:16:49,555
I don't know exactly.

1346
01:16:49,622 --> 01:16:52,113
Being too much like her.

1347
01:16:52,192 --> 01:16:57,220
People always think that
she and Buck are... were alike.

1348
01:16:58,331 --> 01:17:01,323
But it's really she and Conrad.

1349
01:17:01,399 --> 01:17:03,890
They were the only two...

1350
01:17:03,970 --> 01:17:06,962
that didn't cry at the funeral.

1351
01:17:07,037 --> 01:17:11,067
It's not easy for me to admit this...

1352
01:17:11,144 --> 01:17:12,609
but. Um...

1353
01:17:12,679 --> 01:17:14,145
she didn't...

1354
01:17:18,149 --> 01:17:21,676
His mother doesn't
show him much affection.

1355
01:17:21,755 --> 01:17:25,417
I'm not trying
to put her down.

1356
01:17:25,492 --> 01:17:29,019
Did she give Buck
much affection?

1357
01:17:29,095 --> 01:17:31,529
God. Yes.
She loved Buck.

1358
01:17:31,595 --> 01:17:33,564
Bucky got so much.

1359
01:17:33,631 --> 01:17:37,158
What she felt for him was special.

1360
01:17:37,237 --> 01:17:39,761
He was her first-born.

1361
01:17:39,837 --> 01:17:41,600
And you?

1362
01:17:41,675 --> 01:17:43,140
I loved Buck.

1363
01:17:43,210 --> 01:17:45,371
I mean your wife's affection.

1364
01:17:45,444 --> 01:17:46,912
For me?

1365
01:17:46,979 --> 01:17:48,277
Yes.

1366
01:17:49,381 --> 01:17:51,145
She's very...

1367
01:17:51,216 --> 01:17:55,314
No. There's no problem
with her for me.

1368
01:17:55,386 --> 01:17:59,085
We've been married
nearly 21 years.

Everybody loves Beth.

1370
01:18:01,728 --> 01:18:05,127
For Conrad. It's been difficult.

1371
01:18:05,198 --> 01:18:07,996
He didn't talk about that?

1372
01:18:08,068 --> 01:18:11,060
We don't know what happens here.

1373
01:18:11,136 --> 01:18:13,104
It doesn't come up.

1374
01:18:17,577 --> 01:18:20,546
I guess that's what it is.

1375
01:18:20,613 --> 01:18:22,944
It's private here. Isn't it?

1376
01:18:23,015 --> 01:18:24,448
Mm-hmm.
Very private.

1377
01:18:28,220 --> 01:18:32,157
I think I know why I came here.

1378
01:18:34,261 --> 01:18:37,594
I think I came here
to talk about myself.

1379
01:18:37,662 --> 01:18:40,426
Okay. Why don't we?

1380
01:18:46,939 --> 01:18:48,274
Hi.

[Buzzing Continues]

1384
01:18:56,448 --> 01:18:57,916
What's the matter?

1385
01:19:04,055 --> 01:19:06,546
This will sound strange.

1386
01:19:08,127 --> 01:19:12,121
What I'm going to say
will sound strange.

1387
01:19:12,198 --> 01:19:13,662
What happened?

1388
01:19:13,733 --> 01:19:15,166
Come inside.

1389
01:19:16,502 --> 01:19:19,265
Could we talk about
Buck's funeral?

1390
01:19:19,337 --> 01:19:20,930
What?

1391
01:19:21,006 --> 01:19:25,000
It'll seem trivial.
But it's on my mind.

1392
01:19:25,078 --> 01:19:28,046
I'd like to talk about it.

1393
01:19:28,113 --> 01:19:32,050
When I was getting dressed
for Buck's funeral...

1394
01:19:32,118 --> 01:19:35,576
What could getting dressed
for Buck's funeral...

1395
01:19:35,654 --> 01:19:38,122
have to do with anything?

1396
01:19:38,189 --> 01:19:40,819
I was wearing a blue shirt.

1397
01:19:40,894 --> 01:19:45,456
You said. "Wear a white shirt
and other shoes."

1398
01:19:45,532 --> 01:19:50,595
It was nothing. But
it seemed to stay with me.

1399
01:19:50,670 --> 01:19:53,161
What difference did it make...

1400
01:19:53,238 --> 01:19:56,265
what I wore to Buck's funeral?

1401
01:19:56,341 --> 01:19:58,332
Hear me out. Beth!

1402
01:19:58,411 --> 01:20:01,435
No one would listen to that.

1403
01:20:01,514 --> 01:20:04,381
I just want to talk about it.

1404
01:20:04,451 --> 01:20:07,350
Why do you want to remind me?

1405
01:20:07,420 --> 01:20:12,255
Because I've wondered what
it mattered what I wore.

1406
01:20:12,323 --> 01:20:14,814
I was crazy that day.

1407
01:20:14,894 --> 01:20:18,953
We were going
to our son's funeral.

1408
01:20:21,434 --> 01:20:25,198
You were worried about
what I wore on my feet.

1409
01:20:25,270 --> 01:20:28,069
It sticks with me...

1410
01:20:28,140 --> 01:20:31,770
and I wanted to
tell you about it.

1411
01:20:44,921 --> 01:20:46,412
It's all right.

1412
01:21:00,872 --> 01:21:02,863
Beth! How are you?

1413
01:21:02,942 --> 01:21:04,930
Fine. How are you?

1414
01:21:05,011 --> 01:21:07,002
I haven't seen you.

1415
01:21:07,078 --> 01:21:09,569
I'll call you. How's Brad?

1416
01:21:09,649 --> 01:21:12,140
Fabulous! Is everything okay?

1417
01:21:12,216 --> 01:21:13,707
Isn't this madness?

1418
01:21:13,787 --> 01:21:16,278
It gets worse every year.

1419
01:21:16,354 --> 01:21:17,823
Good-bye.

May I show you this?

1423
01:21:32,671 --> 01:21:35,162
Oh. No. No. Thanks.

Bennetts. Grants. And Foleys.

1425
01:21:45,385 --> 01:21:48,912
Conrad should get something
for my parents.

1426
01:21:48,988 --> 01:21:53,582
He's not getting something
for his doctor. Is he?

1427
01:21:53,658 --> 01:21:56,925
We should go see Dr. Berger.

1428
01:21:56,996 --> 01:21:58,224
What?

1429
01:21:58,296 --> 01:22:01,287
We could all go see him.

1430
01:22:01,367 --> 01:22:02,729
Why?

1431
01:22:02,801 --> 01:22:05,770
He thinks it's a good idea.

1432
01:22:05,837 --> 01:22:08,305
What's he know about me?

1433
01:22:08,372 --> 01:22:11,036
I've never even met him.

1434
01:22:11,109 --> 01:22:15,809
Wouldn't it be easier
if we all talked about it?

1435
01:22:15,881 --> 01:22:18,372
What will we talk about?

1436
01:22:18,451 --> 01:22:20,942
Don't try to change me.

1437
01:22:21,020 --> 01:22:22,487
Hasn't enough happened?

1438
01:22:22,555 --> 01:22:26,149
Let's hold on to what we've got.

1439
01:22:26,225 --> 01:22:28,626
That's what this is for.

1440
01:22:28,694 --> 01:22:30,127
Maybe you'll be surprised.

1441
01:22:30,194 --> 01:22:31,890
I don't want surprises.

1442
01:22:34,265 --> 01:22:36,756
I know I'm not perfect.

1443
01:22:36,836 --> 01:22:40,430
If I can't hug everybody
like you. I'm sorry.

1444
01:22:40,506 --> 01:22:42,837
You're missing the point.

1445
01:22:42,908 --> 01:22:45,969
I don't want to see counselors.

1446
01:22:46,045 --> 01:22:48,511
This is my family.

1447
01:22:48,581 --> 01:22:50,572
We will solve our problems...

1448
01:22:50,649 --> 01:22:54,176
in the privacy of our own home...

1449
01:22:54,252 --> 01:22:56,743
not by running to some...

1450
01:22:56,823 --> 01:22:58,412
Ready to order?

1451
01:22:58,488 --> 01:23:02,018
Could you give me
a few minutes?

1452
01:23:02,095 --> 01:23:06,122
Running to experts every time
something goes wrong.

1453
01:23:11,502 --> 01:23:14,198
I know you mean well.

1454
01:23:14,274 --> 01:23:17,935
I want this to be
a nice Christmas.

1455
01:23:18,011 --> 01:23:21,469
I want them all to be nice.

1456
01:23:21,546 --> 01:23:24,881
You and I need time together.

1457
01:23:24,951 --> 01:23:27,385
We must get away.

1458
01:23:27,453 --> 01:23:30,786
New Years'. We'll spend
time in Houston...

1459
01:23:30,854 --> 01:23:32,323
with my brother.

1460
01:23:32,390 --> 01:23:34,952
Play some golf. Relax.

1461
01:23:36,095 --> 01:23:37,926
I've talked to Mother.

1462
01:23:37,997 --> 01:23:40,488
Conrad can stay with them.

1463
01:23:40,567 --> 01:23:43,127
Please don't worry about it.

1464
01:23:43,202 --> 01:23:46,430
Please. For his sake.
Don't indulge him.

1465
01:23:46,506 --> 01:23:48,997
We need time together.

1466
01:23:49,073 --> 01:23:50,667
Okay?

1467
01:23:51,810 --> 01:23:53,438
Okay.

1468
01:23:53,511 --> 01:23:55,640
Okay.

1469
01:23:55,715 --> 01:23:57,341
I love you.

1470
01:24:00,118 --> 01:24:01,948
I love you. Too.

1471
01:24:06,125 --> 01:24:09,322
Let's just give things time. Okay?

1472
01:24:09,395 --> 01:24:10,725
Okay.

1473
01:24:21,006 --> 01:24:22,337
Conrad.

1474
01:24:22,408 --> 01:24:23,430
Hmm?

1475
01:24:23,509 --> 01:24:25,170
I don't bowl.

1476
01:24:25,243 --> 01:24:26,939
I'm a horrible bowler.

1477
01:24:27,011 --> 01:24:28,444
That's all right.

1478
01:24:28,514 --> 01:24:30,707
Yeah. Well...

1479
01:24:32,452 --> 01:24:33,885
I got it.

1480
01:24:33,953 --> 01:24:37,389
The thing is.
I'm a funny bowler.

1481
01:24:37,457 --> 01:24:40,426
Listen. We don't
have to go bowling.

1482
01:24:40,493 --> 01:24:42,893
I'm not a bowling nut.

1483
01:24:42,962 --> 01:24:44,520
How funny are you?

1484
01:24:44,595 --> 01:24:48,930
On a scale from 1 to 10...
About a 10.

1485
01:24:49,002 --> 01:24:50,399
That's pretty funny.

1486
01:24:50,470 --> 01:24:52,868
I promise you won't look silly.

1487
01:24:52,939 --> 01:24:54,600
Guarantee it?

1488
01:24:54,671 --> 01:24:56,005
Guarantee it.

1489
01:25:21,801 --> 01:25:24,326
Can you break the ball?

1490
01:25:25,438 --> 01:25:28,930
Can't break anything
in a bowling alley.

1491
01:25:29,006 --> 01:25:31,875
That's what I like
about bowling alleys.

1492
01:25:31,944 --> 01:25:34,139
Can't even break the record.

1493
01:25:41,854 --> 01:25:43,344
Anyway...

1494
01:25:43,421 --> 01:25:45,252
Hmm? What?

1495
01:25:45,323 --> 01:25:47,587
It's a conversation starter.

1496
01:25:47,658 --> 01:25:48,957
Catchy.

1497
01:25:49,028 --> 01:25:50,287
You like it?

1498
01:25:50,363 --> 01:25:54,024
I've been working on it all day.

1499
01:25:54,100 --> 01:25:57,591
Are people punished
for things they do?

1500
01:25:57,670 --> 01:25:59,136
By God?

1501
01:25:59,203 --> 01:26:00,171
Yeah.

1502
01:26:00,238 --> 01:26:02,729
I don't believe in God.

1503
01:26:02,809 --> 01:26:04,274
Not at all?

1504
01:26:04,341 --> 01:26:06,707
Either you do or don't.

1505
01:26:06,779 --> 01:26:09,975
I believe in God.

1506
01:26:10,046 --> 01:26:13,345
You afraid he'll punish you
for something?

1507
01:26:13,417 --> 01:26:17,412
I've done many things
I'm ashamed of.

1508
01:26:19,457 --> 01:26:21,448
Yeah? So have I.

1509
01:26:29,702 --> 01:26:31,292
Did it hurt?

1510
01:26:37,341 --> 01:26:39,277
I don't remember really.

1511
01:26:39,345 --> 01:26:42,801
You don't want
to talk about it?

1512
01:26:42,881 --> 01:26:45,975
I've never really
talked about it.

1513
01:26:46,051 --> 01:26:50,622
To doctors.
But not to anyone else.

1514
01:26:50,756 --> 01:26:52,121
You're the first who's asked.

1515
01:26:52,189 --> 01:26:54,819
Why did you do it?

1516
01:26:54,893 --> 01:26:56,224
Uh...

1517
01:27:01,899 --> 01:27:04,890
I don't know.
It was like...

1518
01:27:04,970 --> 01:27:06,938
falling into a hole.

1519
01:27:08,037 --> 01:27:11,532
It was like falling into a hole.

1520
01:27:11,609 --> 01:27:13,600
It keeps getting bigger...

1521
01:27:13,679 --> 01:27:15,645
and you can't escape.

1522
01:27:15,712 --> 01:27:19,081
All of a sudden, it's inside...

1523
01:27:19,149 --> 01:27:20,743
and you're the hole.

1524
01:27:20,819 --> 01:27:23,912
You're trapped.
And it's all over.

1525
01:27:23,988 --> 01:27:25,889
Something like that.

1526
01:27:25,957 --> 01:27:27,926
It's not really scary...

1527
01:27:27,993 --> 01:27:30,587
except when
you think back on it.

1528
01:27:30,662 --> 01:27:35,032
'Cause you know
what you were feeling...

1529
01:27:35,100 --> 01:27:36,497
# Like McDonald's can #

1530
01:27:36,568 --> 01:27:38,966
# Nobody can do it #

1531
01:27:39,037 --> 01:27:40,662
# Like McDonald's can #

1532
01:27:40,738 --> 01:27:44,573
# You deserve
a break today #

1533
01:27:44,643 --> 01:27:47,578
# So get up
and get away #

1534
01:27:47,645 --> 01:27:49,408
Hey. Jarrett.

1535
01:27:49,479 --> 01:27:52,573
How you doing?
How about some fries?

1536
01:27:52,649 --> 01:27:54,515
What are you doing?

1537
01:27:57,488 --> 01:27:58,956
Hey. Lighten up.

1538
01:27:59,024 --> 01:28:02,118
Hey. I don't like your attitude.

1539
01:28:28,185 --> 01:28:30,381
Energetic. Those guys.

1540
01:28:30,456 --> 01:28:32,354
They were pretty funny.

1541
01:28:32,421 --> 01:28:33,890
No.

1542
01:28:33,957 --> 01:28:35,948
You thought they were.

1543
01:28:36,028 --> 01:28:37,493
No. L...

1544
01:28:46,770 --> 01:28:48,261
I'm sorry.

1545
01:28:48,340 --> 01:28:49,805
What for?

1546
01:28:53,979 --> 01:28:55,444
Anyway...

1547
01:29:11,395 --> 01:29:13,886
Do you want to talk?

1548
01:29:13,966 --> 01:29:15,430
About what?

1549
01:29:17,536 --> 01:29:19,002
Are you okay?

1550
01:29:19,069 --> 01:29:20,537
Yeah.

1551
01:29:20,604 --> 01:29:22,073
Yeah. I'm fine.

1552
01:29:23,175 --> 01:29:26,109
I'll give you a call.

1553
01:29:26,176 --> 01:29:29,408
Will you? I want you to.

1554
01:29:29,479 --> 01:29:31,412
Sure.

1555
01:29:39,524 --> 01:29:40,992
Well...

1556
01:29:42,060 --> 01:29:44,551
I'll see you in choir.

1557
01:29:44,630 --> 01:29:46,095
Okay. Yeah.

1558
01:29:46,162 --> 01:29:48,326
Thanks.

1559
01:29:48,399 --> 01:29:50,197
Okay.

1560
01:29:50,269 --> 01:29:52,760
I mean. Good night.

1561
01:29:52,837 --> 01:29:54,305
Good night.

1562
01:30:07,185 --> 01:30:08,653
Seven.

1563
01:30:08,720 --> 01:30:11,712
In preparation
for our landing in Houston,

1564
01:30:11,787 --> 01:30:14,814
observe the fasten
seat belt sign,

1565
01:30:14,893 --> 01:30:18,055
and no smoking until
well inside the terminal.

1566
01:30:27,470 --> 01:30:29,529
Watch this.

1567
01:30:29,608 --> 01:30:31,041
Pessimistic golfer.

1568
01:30:31,109 --> 01:30:32,599
Pessimistic golfer.

1569
01:30:33,712 --> 01:30:35,202
Oh. Damn!

1570
01:30:37,180 --> 01:30:39,171
Are we two up?

1571
01:30:39,251 --> 01:30:40,738
Two.

1572
01:30:40,819 --> 01:30:42,309
Let's hustle up.

1573
01:30:42,386 --> 01:30:44,377
It is flat here.

1574
01:30:44,456 --> 01:30:48,551
But we decided
to teach you to love it.

He wants everybody to move here.

1576
01:30:51,761 --> 01:30:54,287
It's good to see you.

1577
01:30:54,363 --> 01:30:57,563
- You look tired. Cal.
- Airplane scotch.

1578
01:30:57,636 --> 01:31:00,296
Why am I still hungry?

1579
01:31:00,372 --> 01:31:02,237
'Cause you're in Texas.

1580
01:31:02,305 --> 01:31:04,296
We'll get you home.

1581
01:31:04,376 --> 01:31:06,344
Get some steaks on.

1582
01:31:06,411 --> 01:31:08,572
A baked potato. Too?

1583
01:31:08,645 --> 01:31:12,207
How long has he had
that drawl?

1584
01:31:12,283 --> 01:31:14,309
Since joining the club.

01:32:02,167 --> 01:32:04,158
It sure wasn't funny.

1587

We weren't that bad.

1588
01:32:06,305 --> 01:32:10,867
I can't listen to that
Buck Jarrett lecture again.

1589
01:32:10,943 --> 01:32:14,470
He bugs me
when he does that.

1590
01:32:14,546 --> 01:32:18,104
Will he ever stop
kissing his picture?

1591
01:32:18,180 --> 01:32:19,649
Stillman. Shut up.

1592
01:32:21,086 --> 01:32:23,077
Connie. Want a ride?

1593
01:32:23,154 --> 01:32:24,622
Oh. No. Thanks.

1594
01:32:24,689 --> 01:32:27,215
We could've used you today.

1595
01:32:27,292 --> 01:32:29,283
I don't think so.

1596
01:32:29,359 --> 01:32:32,328
Nobody could've helped us.

1597
01:32:32,395 --> 01:32:35,389
I hear you got eyes for Pratt.

1598
01:32:35,466 --> 01:32:37,229
Made it with her yet?

1599
01:32:37,301 --> 01:32:38,734
Don't be a prick.

1600
01:32:38,804 --> 01:32:40,895
You're the prick.

1601
01:32:40,970 --> 01:32:45,501
You give me a goddamn
pain in the ass.

1602
01:32:49,912 --> 01:32:52,542
Connie. Come on!
Come on!

No!

No!

1607
01:33:02,292 --> 01:33:04,988
Let go! Let go!

1608
01:33:05,063 --> 01:33:07,429
It's all right!

1609
01:33:07,497 --> 01:33:09,930
Just calm down.

You're crazy!
You know that?

1611
01:33:15,006 --> 01:33:18,443
Send him back
where he came from!

1612

It's over. It's over.

Shit!

Here's your hat.

01:33:46,136 --> 01:33:49,073
You want to talk?

The guy's a nothing.

1618
01:33:51,207 --> 01:33:53,037
He's a zero upstairs.

1619
01:33:53,109 --> 01:33:56,078
Since fourth grade,
you've known that.

1620
01:33:56,148 --> 01:33:58,139
So you look stupid...

1621
01:33:58,216 --> 01:34:01,149
when you let him get to you!

So I look stupid?

What's with you?

1624
01:34:05,323 --> 01:34:09,917
Why do you want
to be in this alone?

1625
01:34:12,395 --> 01:34:15,229
You know. I miss him. Too.

1626

The three of us
were best friends.

It hurts too much
to be around you.

01:38:22,881 --> 01:38:24,109
Okay.

1683
01:38:28,319 --> 01:38:30,810
Good. You're here.

1684
01:38:30,889 --> 01:38:32,322
Something happened.

1685
01:38:32,390 --> 01:38:33,854
Just a minute.

1686
01:38:33,925 --> 01:38:36,393
Wait till we get inside.

1687
01:38:38,563 --> 01:38:39,493
There.

1688
01:38:41,064 --> 01:38:42,622
Shit.

1689
01:38:42,698 --> 01:38:46,395
You'd think they'd assume
there'd be emergencies.

1690
01:38:46,470 --> 01:38:48,336
Don't take it off.
Just sit down.

1691
01:38:53,077 --> 01:38:54,009
Something happened.

1692
01:38:54,078 --> 01:38:55,136
What?

1693
01:38:55,212 --> 01:38:56,612
It's...

1694
01:38:56,680 --> 01:38:58,078
It's what?

1695
01:38:58,149 --> 01:38:59,613
Oh. God!

1696
01:39:01,219 --> 01:39:02,743
I need something.

1697
01:39:02,819 --> 01:39:03,947
What?

1698
01:39:04,020 --> 01:39:05,511
It keeps coming.

1699
01:39:05,590 --> 01:39:07,488
I can't stop it!

1700
01:39:07,559 --> 01:39:09,149
Don't try.

1701
01:39:09,225 --> 01:39:11,752
Got to get off the hook.

1702
01:39:11,828 --> 01:39:13,457
For what?

1703
01:39:13,529 --> 01:39:15,590
What I did to him!

1704
01:39:15,667 --> 01:39:16,792
What?

1705
01:39:16,868 --> 01:39:19,336
It must be somebody's fault...

1706
01:39:19,404 --> 01:39:21,564
or there's no point!

1707
01:39:21,639 --> 01:39:23,630
What point? It happened!

1708
01:39:23,707 --> 01:39:26,768
Oh. No. I don't mean that.

1709
01:39:26,845 --> 01:39:28,335
It's just that...

1710
01:39:28,412 --> 01:39:30,938
Bucky. I didn't mean it.

1711
01:39:31,015 --> 01:39:33,984
Bucky, I didn't mean it.

1712
01:39:34,051 --> 01:39:35,881
Bucky!

1713
01:39:35,953 --> 01:39:36,978
It wasn't your fault.

1714
01:39:37,055 --> 01:39:39,353
You said. "Get the sail down!"

1715
01:39:39,421 --> 01:39:41,551
I couldn't! It jammed!

1716
01:39:41,626 --> 01:39:43,319
And then the halyard jammed!

1717
01:39:43,394 --> 01:39:45,328
Because the goddamned
halyard jammed!

1718
01:39:45,395 --> 01:39:48,331
Then you're sittin' here
screwing around!

1719
01:39:48,399 --> 01:39:50,127
Until it's too late!

1720
01:39:50,201 --> 01:39:53,363
And I'm supposed
to take care of it!

1721
01:39:53,438 --> 01:39:54,631
That wasn't fair.

1722
01:39:54,706 --> 01:39:57,640
No! And then
you say. "Hang on!"

1723
01:39:57,707 --> 01:39:58,801
"Hang on!"

1724
01:39:58,877 --> 01:40:00,502
Then you let go!

1725
01:40:00,578 --> 01:40:02,136
Why'd you let go?

1726
01:40:02,212 --> 01:40:03,439
I got tired!

1727
01:40:03,514 --> 01:40:06,140
Yeah? Well. Screw you. You jerk!

1728
01:40:18,630 --> 01:40:22,029
It hurts to be mad at him.

1729
01:40:22,100 --> 01:40:23,567
Yeah.

1730
01:40:25,837 --> 01:40:27,862
He just wasn't careful.

1731
01:40:27,939 --> 01:40:31,841
He didn't see how
a bad thing might happen.

1732
01:40:31,908 --> 01:40:35,676
Bad things happen even
when people are careful.

1733
01:40:35,747 --> 01:40:37,680
We should've come in...

1734
01:40:37,747 --> 01:40:40,341
when it started to look bad.

1735
01:40:40,417 --> 01:40:42,750
So you made a mistake.

1736
01:40:42,819 --> 01:40:45,118
Why did he let go?

1737
01:40:45,189 --> 01:40:46,679
Why?

1738
01:40:46,756 --> 01:40:49,818
Maybe you were stronger.

1739
01:40:49,894 --> 01:40:53,125
Did that ever occur to you?

1740
01:41:01,072 --> 01:41:04,064
How long will you
punish yourself?

1741
01:41:04,140 --> 01:41:05,268
When will you quit?

1742
01:41:05,341 --> 01:41:07,037
I'd like to.

1743
01:41:07,109 --> 01:41:08,442
Why don't you?

1744
01:41:08,511 --> 01:41:11,243
It's not that easy.

1745
01:41:17,822 --> 01:41:19,287
God...

1746
01:41:19,354 --> 01:41:21,323
I loved him.

1747
01:41:25,462 --> 01:41:27,453
I know.

1748
01:41:41,979 --> 01:41:45,176
What happened?
What started all this?

1749
01:41:45,247 --> 01:41:46,738
Karen.

1750
01:41:48,519 --> 01:41:50,817
She killed herself.

1751
01:41:50,886 --> 01:41:53,912
I just found out she's dead.

1752
01:41:53,992 --> 01:41:56,051
Jesus.

1753
01:41:56,127 --> 01:41:58,322
She was fine.

1754
01:41:58,395 --> 01:42:00,728
No. She wasn't.

1755
01:42:00,796 --> 01:42:04,287
She told me!
She said she was...

1756
01:42:04,368 --> 01:42:05,336
What?

1757
01:42:05,403 --> 01:42:08,167
She was busy and
feeling good and...

1758
01:42:08,238 --> 01:42:09,261
What?

1759
01:42:11,042 --> 01:42:12,234
What?

1760
01:42:12,310 --> 01:42:13,707
If I'd known...

1761
01:42:13,778 --> 01:42:15,268
I could've done something.

1762
01:42:15,345 --> 01:42:18,144
You're taking her on. Too?

1763
01:42:18,216 --> 01:42:19,148
No!

1764
01:42:19,216 --> 01:42:20,149
No?

1765
01:42:20,216 --> 01:42:21,685
No. I just...

1766
01:42:21,752 --> 01:42:22,685
What?

1767
01:42:22,752 --> 01:42:24,185
That isn't it.

1768
01:42:24,255 --> 01:42:27,349
I feel really bad about this.

1769
01:42:27,425 --> 01:42:30,756
Just let me feel bad about this!

1770
01:42:31,929 --> 01:42:33,225
Okay.

1771
01:42:35,533 --> 01:42:38,796
Listen. I feel
bad about it. Too.

1772
01:42:42,840 --> 01:42:45,363
Why do things
happen to people?

1773
01:42:45,443 --> 01:42:47,841
It isn't fair.

1774
01:42:47,912 --> 01:42:50,608
You're right.
It isn't fair.

1775
01:42:50,680 --> 01:42:53,081
You just do one wrong thing...

1776
01:42:53,149 --> 01:42:54,618
and...

1777
01:42:54,685 --> 01:42:57,279
Um-hmm.

1778
01:42:57,354 --> 01:43:01,189
And what was the one
wrong thing you did?

1779
01:43:08,162 --> 01:43:09,631
You know.

1780
01:43:22,645 --> 01:43:24,408
You know.

1781
01:43:27,417 --> 01:43:29,318
I hung on.

1782
01:43:29,386 --> 01:43:32,514
I stayed with the boat.

1783
01:43:32,590 --> 01:43:34,216
Exactly.

1784
01:43:39,930 --> 01:43:43,921
Now. You can live
with that. Can't you?

1785
01:43:50,073 --> 01:43:52,042
I'm scared!

1786
01:43:52,109 --> 01:43:54,304
I'm scared.

1787
01:43:54,377 --> 01:43:56,608
Feelings are scary.

1788
01:43:56,680 --> 01:43:58,773
And sometimes they're painful.

1789
01:43:58,849 --> 01:44:01,113
If you can't feel pain...

1790
01:44:01,185 --> 01:44:04,176
you won't feel
anything else.

1791
01:44:04,255 --> 01:44:06,849
You know what I'm saying?

1792
01:44:09,960 --> 01:44:11,518
I think so.

1793
01:44:14,465 --> 01:44:16,194
You're here. You're alive.

1794
01:44:16,265 --> 01:44:19,064
Don't say you don't feel that.

1795
01:44:19,136 --> 01:44:21,363
It doesn't feel good.

1796
01:44:21,438 --> 01:44:22,871
It is good.

1797
01:44:22,939 --> 01:44:24,407
Believe me.

1798
01:44:28,813 --> 01:44:30,676
How do you know?

1799
01:44:32,750 --> 01:44:34,944
Because I'm your friend.

1800
01:44:39,256 --> 01:44:42,692
I don't know
what I would've done...

1801
01:44:42,760 --> 01:44:45,194
if you hadn't been here.

1802
01:44:48,765 --> 01:44:51,496
You're really my friend?

1803
01:44:53,604 --> 01:44:56,402
I am. Count on it.

1804
01:45:49,158 --> 01:45:50,591
Hi.

1805
01:45:50,661 --> 01:45:52,094
I would've called...

1806
01:45:52,162 --> 01:45:55,095
but I didn't
want to wake anyone.

1807
01:45:55,162 --> 01:45:56,595
About the other night...

1808
01:45:56,667 --> 01:45:59,100
I liked being with you.

1809
01:45:59,167 --> 01:46:01,603
I didn't like myself.

1810
01:46:01,671 --> 01:46:03,604
Conrad. I was stupid.

1811
01:46:03,671 --> 01:46:06,609
That was dumb of me to laugh.

1812
01:46:06,676 --> 01:46:08,609
It was my fault.

1813
01:46:08,679 --> 01:46:10,703
I was embarrassed.

1814
01:46:10,779 --> 01:46:11,939
Really?

1815
01:46:12,015 --> 01:46:13,779
You were embarrassed?

1816
01:46:13,850 --> 01:46:16,081
When those boys came in...

1817
01:46:16,153 --> 01:46:18,644
it was awful and awkward.

1818
01:46:18,720 --> 01:46:20,984
When I'm embarrassed. I laugh.

1819
01:46:21,055 --> 01:46:24,354
They were just having
a good time.

1820
01:46:24,426 --> 01:46:28,386
I let them interfere
with what was happening.

1821
01:46:28,465 --> 01:46:29,930
It was dumb.

1822
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:33,527
I've done lots of
dumb things lately.

1823
01:46:33,604 --> 01:46:38,301
I just didn't know if you were
being straight with me.

1824
01:46:41,444 --> 01:46:42,912
Yeah?

1825
01:46:42,979 --> 01:46:46,345
Anyway. I'd like
to try it again.

1826
01:46:46,417 --> 01:46:47,850
It worked okay...

1827
01:46:47,917 --> 01:46:50,045
except for the bowling.

1828
01:46:50,118 --> 01:46:51,587
Yes.

1829
01:46:51,654 --> 01:46:53,520
Yes?

1830
01:46:54,625 --> 01:46:56,684
Yes.

1831
01:46:57,761 --> 01:47:00,252
Are you going to school?

1832
01:47:00,331 --> 01:47:03,162
No. Not on Sunday.

1833
01:47:06,002 --> 01:47:07,993
Have you eaten?

1834
01:47:08,072 --> 01:47:10,095
No. I haven't.

1835
01:47:10,171 --> 01:47:12,608
Do you want some breakfast?

1836
01:47:14,545 --> 01:47:16,011
Okay.

1837
01:47:29,760 --> 01:47:31,055
Mom!

1838
01:47:32,930 --> 01:47:35,296
All right.
How about that?

1839
01:47:35,363 --> 01:47:36,796
Boy. Oh. Boy.

1840
01:47:36,867 --> 01:47:38,835
I do love that.

1841
01:47:38,902 --> 01:47:41,894
These holes sure do love you.

1842
01:47:41,970 --> 01:47:45,965
We should spend more time
playing golf together.

1843
01:47:46,042 --> 01:47:49,011
Maybe our next vacation...
strictly golf.

1844
01:47:49,078 --> 01:47:50,546
Pinehurst.
Myrtle Beach.

1845
01:47:50,613 --> 01:47:52,582
Pinehurst would be nice.

1846
01:47:52,649 --> 01:47:55,640
I think Connie would
like Pinehurst.

1847
01:47:55,719 --> 01:47:59,176
Is that deliberate
or just a reflex?

1848
01:47:59,256 --> 01:48:02,247
I assumed you meant him. Too.

1849
01:48:02,326 --> 01:48:05,295
I'm surprised you
haven't called him.

1850
01:48:05,362 --> 01:48:07,328
I'll call him tonight.

1851
01:48:07,398 --> 01:48:10,390
Can we have a little drink?

1852
01:48:10,466 --> 01:48:12,435
Drink. Yes. Little. No.

1853
01:48:12,502 --> 01:48:13,970
Let's finish this.

1854
01:48:14,037 --> 01:48:14,970
What?

1855
01:48:15,037 --> 01:48:16,506
What you started.

1856
01:48:16,573 --> 01:48:18,541
Me? There's no point.

1857
01:48:18,609 --> 01:48:20,076
He controls you.

1858
01:48:20,144 --> 01:48:22,112
He isn't the problem.

1859
01:48:22,179 --> 01:48:23,645
Isn't he?

1860
01:48:23,712 --> 01:48:27,113
No. Let's talk about
what's bothering you.

1861
01:48:27,184 --> 01:48:30,176
No. Let's discuss
what's bothering you.

1862
01:48:30,252 --> 01:48:34,247
How did I make you
so angry with me?

1863
01:48:34,323 --> 01:48:36,792
You blame me
for everything.

1864
01:48:36,859 --> 01:48:39,328
Can't you see
beyond yourself?

1865
01:48:39,395 --> 01:48:40,863
No. I can't!

1866
01:48:40,930 --> 01:48:43,921
Neither can you
or anybody else!

1867
01:48:44,001 --> 01:48:45,434
I'm just honest.

1868
01:48:45,502 --> 01:48:46,969
Stop being honest...

1869
01:48:47,037 --> 01:48:49,005
and start being generous!

1870
01:48:49,073 --> 01:48:50,537
Think about him!

1871
01:48:50,604 --> 01:48:53,576
What does he expect from me?

1872
01:48:53,644 --> 01:48:57,636
He wants a hug
when he passes exams?

1873
01:48:57,712 --> 01:49:00,706
I can't respond
when someone says...

1874
01:49:00,783 --> 01:49:03,752
"I did something
great. Love me."

1875
01:49:03,819 --> 01:49:07,814
He wants to know
you don't hate him.

1876
01:49:07,890 --> 01:49:10,381
Mothers don't hate their sons.

1877
01:49:10,461 --> 01:49:13,430
Is that what he told you?

1878
01:49:13,497 --> 01:49:17,488
You accept what he says
with no questions.

1879
01:49:17,568 --> 01:49:20,560
I'm trying to
keep this family...

1880
01:49:20,636 --> 01:49:23,604
What does everyone
want from me?

1881
01:49:23,671 --> 01:49:28,109
Listen. We all just
want you to be happy.

1882
01:49:28,176 --> 01:49:29,645
Happy?

1883
01:49:29,712 --> 01:49:30,680
Yes.

1884
01:49:30,747 --> 01:49:34,444
You tell me
the definition of happy.

1885
01:49:34,518 --> 01:49:37,783
First. Be sure your kids are safe...

1886
01:49:37,854 --> 01:49:41,345
that nobody's been hit by a car...

1887
01:49:41,425 --> 01:49:44,417
or drowned in your swimming pool!

1888
01:49:44,493 --> 01:49:47,987
Then tell me how to be happy!

1889
01:50:41,518 --> 01:50:43,984
I'm turning in.

1890
01:50:44,054 --> 01:50:45,520
Dinner was good.

1891
01:50:45,587 --> 01:50:47,055
Really good.

1892
01:50:47,122 --> 01:50:49,555
It's early. You tired?

1893
01:50:49,626 --> 01:50:51,890
It was a rough week.

1894
01:50:51,962 --> 01:50:55,693
Your grandmother
wasn't too tough on you?

1895
01:50:55,765 --> 01:50:57,734
No. She was fine.

1896
01:51:00,304 --> 01:51:02,828
I'm glad you're back.

1897
01:51:17,185 --> 01:51:18,654
Good night.

1898
01:52:37,434 --> 01:52:41,837
[Sobbing]

1899
01:52:48,578 --> 01:52:50,011
Calvin?

1900
01:53:01,957 --> 01:53:03,859
Why are you crying?

1901
01:53:10,701 --> 01:53:12,167
Can I. Uh...

1902
01:53:12,234 --> 01:53:14,703
Can I get you something?

1903
01:53:16,805 --> 01:53:18,274
I don't...

1904
01:53:18,341 --> 01:53:20,310
What did you say?

1905
01:53:24,479 --> 01:53:26,779
Calvin. What did you say?

1906
01:53:26,850 --> 01:53:28,372
[Sighing]

1907
01:53:31,319 --> 01:53:33,515
Tell me.

1908
01:53:40,162 --> 01:53:41,631
You are beautiful.

1909
01:53:45,234 --> 01:53:47,725
And you are unpredictable.

1910
01:53:49,840 --> 01:53:51,805
But you're so cautious.

1911
01:53:54,411 --> 01:53:55,844
You're determined. Beth...

1912
01:53:55,912 --> 01:53:58,037
but you know something?

1913
01:54:00,350 --> 01:54:01,942
You're not strong.

1914
01:54:04,054 --> 01:54:07,319
I don't know
if you're really giving.

1915
01:54:10,493 --> 01:54:11,984
Tell me something.

1916
01:54:12,060 --> 01:54:14,154
Do you love me?

1917
01:54:16,265 --> 01:54:18,734
Do you really love me?

1918
01:54:21,104 --> 01:54:24,939
I feel the way I've always
felt about you.

1919
01:54:37,554 --> 01:54:40,020
We would've been all right...

1920
01:54:40,090 --> 01:54:43,582
if there hadn't been any mess.

1921
01:54:45,194 --> 01:54:47,662
But you can't handle mess.

1922
01:54:49,265 --> 01:54:52,724
You need everything neat and easy.

1923
01:54:53,837 --> 01:54:55,304
I don't know.

1924
01:54:55,372 --> 01:54:57,840
Maybe you can't love anybody.

1925
01:54:57,908 --> 01:55:00,376
It was so much Buck.

1926
01:55:00,444 --> 01:55:05,438
It's as if you buried
all your love with him.

1927
01:55:05,515 --> 01:55:07,484
I don't understand that.

1928
01:55:09,086 --> 01:55:12,578
Maybe it wasn't even Buck.

1929
01:55:12,654 --> 01:55:15,055
Maybe it was just you.

1930
01:55:15,125 --> 01:55:20,756
Maybe, finally, it was
the best of you that you buried.

1931
01:55:23,332 --> 01:55:25,301
But whatever it was...

1932
01:55:28,939 --> 01:55:31,908
I don't know who you are.

1933
01:55:31,975 --> 01:55:36,469
I don't know what
we've been playing at.

1934
01:55:39,082 --> 01:55:41,207
So I was crying.

1935
01:55:45,720 --> 01:55:49,783
Because I don't know
if I love you anymore.

1936
01:55:52,828 --> 01:55:57,323
And I don't know
what I'll do without that.

1937
01:57:27,090 --> 01:57:28,020
[Door Slams]

1938
01:58:28,585 --> 01:58:29,676
Dad?

1939
01:58:32,921 --> 01:58:35,912
The yard looks smaller
without leaves.

1940
01:58:37,493 --> 01:58:38,961
Dad. What happened?

1941
01:58:41,064 --> 01:58:44,555
Your mother's
going away for a while.

1942
01:58:44,634 --> 01:58:45,792
Where?

1943
01:58:45,868 --> 01:58:47,095
Why?

1944
01:58:47,170 --> 01:58:48,636
Back to Houston.

1945
01:58:49,706 --> 01:58:51,171
I don't know.

1946
01:58:52,274 --> 01:58:53,707
Why? What...

1947
01:58:55,810 --> 01:58:57,279
I know why.

1948
01:58:57,345 --> 01:58:59,314
It's me. Isn't it?

1949
01:58:59,381 --> 01:59:00,350
No.

1950
01:59:00,417 --> 01:59:01,850
It's my fault.

1951
01:59:01,917 --> 01:59:04,180
Don't do that to yourself!

1952
01:59:04,252 --> 01:59:05,685
It's nobody's fault!

1953
01:59:05,756 --> 01:59:09,157
Things happen.
People don't always have answers.

1954
01:59:12,962 --> 01:59:16,761
I don't know why
I'm yelling at you.

1955
01:59:16,832 --> 01:59:19,926
You should do
that more often.

1956
01:59:20,002 --> 01:59:21,729
Haul my ass a little.

1957
01:59:21,805 --> 01:59:23,238
Get after me.

1958
01:59:25,573 --> 01:59:27,411
Like you did for him.

1959
01:59:27,542 --> 01:59:29,011
He needed it.

1960
01:59:29,078 --> 01:59:30,011
You didn't.

1961
01:59:30,078 --> 01:59:33,015
You were always
so hard on yourself.

1962
01:59:33,082 --> 01:59:35,412
I never had the heart.

1963
01:59:35,484 --> 01:59:38,010
Oh. Dad. Don't.

1964
01:59:38,087 --> 01:59:40,318
Well. It's the truth.

1965
01:59:42,091 --> 01:59:44,524
I never worried about you.

1966
01:59:44,594 --> 01:59:47,529
I just wasn't listening.

1967
01:59:48,662 --> 01:59:50,895
I wasn't sending
many signals then.

1968
01:59:50,966 --> 01:59:52,867
You couldn't do anything.

1969
01:59:52,935 --> 01:59:56,497
I should've got
a handle on it somehow.

1970
02:00:01,609 --> 02:00:05,546
I used to figure you had
a handle for everything.

1971
02:00:05,613 --> 02:00:07,845
You knew it all.

1972
02:00:07,917 --> 02:00:11,911
You always made us feel
everything would be all right.

1973
02:00:12,988 --> 02:00:15,957
I've thought about that
a lot lately.

1974
02:00:16,024 --> 02:00:18,493
I really admire you for it.

1975
02:00:18,560 --> 02:00:20,551
Don't admire people too much.

1976
02:00:20,630 --> 02:00:23,724
They'll disappoint you sometimes.

1977
02:00:24,868 --> 02:00:26,733
I'm not disappointed.

1978
02:00:29,904 --> 02:00:32,475
I love you.

1979
02:00:38,081 --> 02:00:39,514
I love you. Too.
