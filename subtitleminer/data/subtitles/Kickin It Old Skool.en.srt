<i>Justin, are you ready for the talent show?</i>

2
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:27,537
Mom, I pity the fool who ain't
ready for the talent show.

3
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:06,841
Wasn't that... something?

4
00:03:08,087 --> 00:03:10,954
A round of applause for Jen.

5
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:14,585
<i>Now we've all-</i>
<i>The Vista Avenue Elementary School-</i>

6
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:17,789
Hey, Jen.
You were way cool out there.

7
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:19,661
Radical. Thanks.

8
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,734
Ooh, I got you something.

9
00:03:26,472 --> 00:03:30,408
- Oh, my God. You got me-
- Garbage Pail Kids Series TwoJellyJenny.

10
00:03:31,811 --> 00:03:35,178
- Y-You don't have it, do you?
- Yeah, I do.

11
00:03:36,749 --> 00:03:38,080
Psych!

12
00:03:41,154 --> 00:03:43,145
<i>Jen!</i>

13
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:49,520
This goober's buying you
Garbage Pail Kids?

14
00:03:49,596 --> 00:03:52,360
- Yeah.
- Well, that's real cool, Schumacher.

15
00:03:53,499 --> 00:03:55,490
I got you something too.

16
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:58,162
It was wicked expensive.

17
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:03,873
- I can't accept this.
- Don't be such a spaz.

18
00:04:03,943 --> 00:04:06,207
<i>Come here.</i>
<i>I'll put it on ya.</i>

19
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:13,282
<i>It's real gold too.</i>

20
00:04:13,353 --> 00:04:15,787
So, do I get a thank-you kiss?

21
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:25,361
That's it?

22
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:27,524
Bogus!

23
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:32,500
- What happened with Jen?
- "Kip-napped."

24
00:04:32,572 --> 00:04:34,938
All you gotta do is
dog him on the dance floor.

25
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:36,976
Turn that Pound Puppy
into a little bitch.

26
00:04:37,043 --> 00:04:39,841
I don't know, you guys.
According to my calculations...

27
00:04:39,912 --> 00:04:42,506
we only have 36% chance
of beating Kip's group.

28
00:04:42,582 --> 00:04:45,142
Well, did you factor in
my special move?

29
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:48,585
- What you talkin' about, Willis?
- Coffee grind and a head spin...

30
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:51,749
freeze, switch...
and pop into a backflip.

31
00:04:51,824 --> 00:04:54,315
Are you wack?
You'll kill yourself out there!

32
00:04:54,394 --> 00:04:57,261
- I'm not lettin' Kip humiliate me in front of-
- Justin?

33
00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:01,733
<i>Ooh!</i>

34
00:05:10,543 --> 00:05:12,738
Kip thinks he can
buy his way into my bra.

35
00:05:16,282 --> 00:05:18,716
I wanted you to have this.

36
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:21,276
- Oh.
- It's my good luck charm.

37
00:05:21,354 --> 00:05:24,721
I feel lucky already.

38
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:27,851
I don't know what you're doin'
after the show, but-

39
00:05:27,927 --> 00:05:32,421
I don't know- do you wanna come over
and maybe watch <i>Blue Lagoon</i>?

40
00:05:33,566 --> 00:05:36,364
We have it on Beta-

41
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:39,735
max.

42
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:43,432
Break a leg, Justin.

43
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:47,001
- I'll see you after the show?
- That'd be smurfy.

44
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:52,140
<i>Hey, Romeo, man, we up next.</i>

45
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,279
Hello? McFly?

46
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:58,415
Marty.

47
00:05:58,491 --> 00:06:00,425
Marty. Hurry up.
Justin's on.

48
00:06:02,228 --> 00:06:04,822
- Oh. Oh.
- Jesus. Jesus.

49
00:06:04,897 --> 00:06:10,563
Now, two break-dancing crews will have a battle.

50
00:06:10,636 --> 00:06:16,165
Please welcome the Funky Fresh Boyz
and the Groundbreakers!

51
00:06:35,995 --> 00:06:38,589
- Let's see what you got, Kip.
- Let's see what you got.

52
00:06:38,664 --> 00:06:41,394
- Put it on the floor.
- It's on the floor. You're steppin' on it.

53
00:06:41,467 --> 00:06:44,800
- And I'm dancin' on it.
- Justin!

Funky Fresh Boyz. F.F.B.!

60
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,022
Go, Kip!

61
00:08:28,808 --> 00:08:30,708
<i>Ooh!</i>

62
00:08:56,502 --> 00:08:59,335
<i>Justin, don't do it!</i>
<i>Justin!</i>

63
00:09:03,976 --> 00:09:05,910
- Justin!
- Justin!

64
00:09:05,978 --> 00:09:08,071
- <i>Justin? Justin?</i>
- <i>Justin?</i>

65
00:09:08,147 --> 00:09:09,842
- Justin.
- Justin.

66
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:11,144
<i>He did the move.</i>

67
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:14,778
Nice play, Shakespeare.

68
00:09:14,854 --> 00:09:16,845
<i>Someone call somebody!</i>

69
00:09:33,372 --> 00:09:36,466
- <i>All right. Slow down.</i>
- I've got it covered.

70
00:09:36,542 --> 00:09:38,476
- Okay. Good. Happy birthday, kid.
- Okay.

71
00:09:38,544 --> 00:09:40,478
Jesus.

72
00:09:40,546 --> 00:09:42,980
I got 20 years
of blisters on my ass.

73
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:46,951
- Here we go.
- Just put a smile on your face.

74
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:49,613
Happy birthday!

75
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:53,181
- Blow out your candles.
- Sylvie.

76
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:56,786
<i>You do this every year.</i>
<i>Never works!</i>

77
00:09:56,862 --> 00:10:00,457
- Why are you so negative?
- I'm not negative.

78
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:01,864
<i>Oh, my God. Marty.</i>

79
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:03,993
- Yeah?
- Marty!

80
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:06,004
Whoa!

81
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:09,371
Fire, fire, fire!
Fire, fire, fire!

82
00:10:10,476 --> 00:10:12,467
<i>Mr. and Mrs. Schumacher?</i>

83
00:10:14,814 --> 00:10:17,009
Hi, Dr. Fry.

84
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:22,747
We have to talk.

85
00:10:22,822 --> 00:10:26,223
Justin's been on unpaid life support
for the last 16 weeks.

86
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:31,355
I just put 16 checks in
the mail this morning. So-

87
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:34,422
I understand how difficult it is
to make payments of this magnitude.

88
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,025
Shit, I'm still paying
for that damn Ferrari.

89
00:10:37,103 --> 00:10:41,164
But, unfortunately, this hospital
can't afford to foot the bill for Justin's care.

90
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:44,573
So, wait a minute. Are you-
Are you gonna unplug him?

91
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:49,342
<i>Justin hasn't made</i>
<i>any progress in 20 years.</i>

92
00:10:49,415 --> 00:10:52,111
And the chances of him reviving
are less than one percent.

93
00:10:52,184 --> 00:10:54,118
Maybe it's time...

94
00:10:54,186 --> 00:10:57,019
<i>to give your son and yourself...</i>

95
00:10:57,089 --> 00:10:58,716
some peace.

96
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:02,085
Does anybody else smell burnt cake?

97
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:05,187
Okay. Could you-
Could you just give us a minute?

98
00:11:05,264 --> 00:11:07,027
Yeah. Thank you.

99
00:11:11,203 --> 00:11:14,297
Justin?
It's Dada.

100
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:18,209
We're gonna unplug you now.

101
00:11:18,277 --> 00:11:20,245
No more electricity.

102
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:23,615
And, Justin...

103
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:26,914
just know that your mom and dad
love you very much.

104
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:33,049
It's a shame we gotta do this
on his birthday, but...

105
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:35,093
let's get those papers
signed, all right?

106
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:37,152
Come on.

107
00:11:48,674 --> 00:11:52,110
- Oh, Marty.
- Honey, it's sad.

108
00:11:52,178 --> 00:11:54,169
But the kid's a vegetable.

109
00:11:54,246 --> 00:11:57,841
I know. I'm gonna miss that little turnip.

110
00:11:57,917 --> 00:11:59,908
- Honey, my ass.
- Huh?

111
00:11:59,985 --> 00:12:02,613
Oh. Strawberry.

112
00:12:02,688 --> 00:12:05,555
Hey, we got the '80s flashback
block comin' at you right now...

113
00:12:05,624 --> 00:12:08,684
with a little tune called "Rockit"
from Mr. Herbie Hancock.

114
00:12:19,271 --> 00:12:22,934
What? Where?

115
00:12:23,008 --> 00:12:24,600
<i>Huh? PONG.</i>

116
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,850
<i>Feet must be asleep.</i>

117
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:43,690
- Justin?
- Hi, Mom.

118
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:46,357
Justin!

119
00:12:49,401 --> 00:12:52,063
Okay. We're okay.

120
00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:56,131
Welcome home, Son!

121
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:59,769
<i>We should have paid for</i>
<i>that coma physical therapy thing.</i>

122
00:12:59,845 --> 00:13:01,813
Doctor said he needed it.

123
00:13:01,881 --> 00:13:04,975
No, that's just the doctors
trying to rip us off for more money.

124
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:06,142
- <i>Justin's fine.</i>
- Dad.

125
00:13:06,218 --> 00:13:08,083
Oh, Justin!

126
00:13:08,154 --> 00:13:11,715
Justin. Hey, watch your legs.
Here we go. Here we go.

127
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:14,760
That's it. Up we go.
Oh. We got ya. Okay.

128
00:13:14,827 --> 00:13:16,419
- You're okay.
- Wow.

129
00:13:16,495 --> 00:13:19,589
- Okay.
- Gettin' a little heavy there.

130
00:13:19,665 --> 00:13:21,656
There we go.
Oh, big step.

131
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:24,726
- Up. That's a boy.
- Okay. Okay.

132
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:27,364
Weebles wobble,
but they don't fall down, right, Dad?

133
00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:29,930
- That's my boy. Oh.
- Oh.

134
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:33,911
- You should catch him.
- The neighbors. Crap. This'll
be on YouTube in an hour.

135
00:13:34,046 --> 00:13:36,640
Oh. There you go.

136
00:13:36,715 --> 00:13:38,808
Watch some MTV.

137
00:13:39,852 --> 00:13:42,514
MTV? Wicked.

138
00:13:42,588 --> 00:13:46,354
<i>We need to gang up</i>
<i>and do something and get revenge on her.</i>

139
00:13:48,694 --> 00:13:51,424
Mom! The TV's broken.

140
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:54,625
Supposed to be MTV,
but they're not playing any videos.

141
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,759
<i>It's just a bunch of girls</i>
<i>talking and crying.</i>

142
00:13:58,771 --> 00:14:01,171
It's good to have him home.

143
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,834
Yeah. Okay. Now...

144
00:14:03,909 --> 00:14:07,037
give this to him, take out the garbage,
and then walk the dog.

145
00:14:07,112 --> 00:14:09,876
What is the use of havin' a kid
if I still gotta do chores?

146
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:12,543
He just came out of a coma.

147
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:14,552
Yeah. It's always something.

148
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:17,646
First he's in a coma,
then he just got out of one.

149
00:14:17,723 --> 00:14:19,782
- Sucks.
- You suck.

150
00:14:22,895 --> 00:14:25,329
R2, see what you can do
with deflector shields.

151
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:29,061
- <i>No, no, no.</i>
- R2.

152
00:14:29,134 --> 00:14:31,125
No, no.

153
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:33,137
Uh, TiVo.

154
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:35,139
Uh, Justin...

155
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:39,007
your mom was saying that the dog
needs walkin' and that the lawn needs mowin'.

156
00:14:39,078 --> 00:14:42,070
And since I've been doin' your chores
for about 20 years...

157
00:14:42,147 --> 00:14:44,945
why don't you give
your old man a rest?

158
00:14:45,017 --> 00:14:47,747
Can I wait until
my arms and legs work?

159
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:50,812
Well, your-your arms and legs
aren't gonna work all by themselves.

160
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:54,986
Son, you've got to
work them until they work.

161
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:58,120
- Mow the lawn, paint the fence.
- Sand the floor?

162
00:14:58,197 --> 00:15:01,530
Dad, is this like Mr. Miyagi telling
Daniel-san to do household chores...

163
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,534
but he's really teaching him karate?

164
00:16:15,305 --> 00:16:17,136
- No.
- Why are we holding hands? I don't-

165
00:16:17,207 --> 00:16:19,437
- Because you'll get-
- I don't want to hold hands. Ow.

166
00:16:20,678 --> 00:16:22,873
- <i>What happened to the mall?</i>
- <i>Nothing.</i>

167
00:16:22,946 --> 00:16:24,937
Business is- it's booming.

168
00:16:28,952 --> 00:16:30,943
- What?
- Just checking. Okay.

169
00:16:31,021 --> 00:16:35,082
<i>I gotta go to the bank.</i>
<i>Why don't you go to the toy store?</i>

170
00:16:35,159 --> 00:16:37,184
Darth Maul?

171
00:16:37,261 --> 00:16:39,559
Jar Jar Binks?

172
00:16:40,831 --> 00:16:42,822
Who are these gay birds?

173
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:45,698
They're not from <i>Star Wars</i>.

174
00:16:48,872 --> 00:16:51,033
Hey.

175
00:16:51,108 --> 00:16:53,201
- What do you like to play with?
- Huh?

176
00:16:53,277 --> 00:16:57,373
- What's your favorite toy?
- Well, I like Tamagotchi. It's like a little pet.

177
00:16:57,448 --> 00:16:59,746
- Is it like a Chia Pet?
- What's a Chia Pet?

178
00:16:59,817 --> 00:17:02,911
Oh! You know what I got at my house?
I got a Slip 'n Slide.

179
00:17:02,986 --> 00:17:06,149
You know what? You should come over sometime.
We could Slip 'n Slide together.

180
00:17:06,223 --> 00:17:08,555
We have potential trouble
in Glazer's Toys.

181
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:11,458
Or we could play army. I could play the sergeant.
You could be the lieutenant.

182
00:17:11,528 --> 00:17:14,395
You and I can get in a trench together.
I can get in your foxhole.

183
00:17:14,465 --> 00:17:16,899
Or you can get in my foxhole.

184
00:17:16,967 --> 00:17:19,435
<i>You and me could play cops and robbers.</i>
<i>I could be the cop.</i>

185
00:17:19,503 --> 00:17:21,994
You could be the robber. I could be like,
"You're goin' downtown." Hey.

186
00:17:22,072 --> 00:17:24,006
- No, no.
- <i>Yeah. Come on.</i>

187
00:17:24,074 --> 00:17:27,168
- Don't make me pull out my nightstick.
- Happy camper in Glazer's Toys!

188
00:17:27,244 --> 00:17:29,804
I repeat. We have a happy camper
in Glazer's Toys!

189
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:33,008
You can come over my house
and sleep over if you want.

190
00:17:34,251 --> 00:17:36,242
You like those foxholes?
Here's a little foxhole.

191
00:17:37,354 --> 00:17:40,346
It's just so damn cute.

192
00:17:40,424 --> 00:17:44,451
I- I don't like- I don't like cute things.
I like boy things!

193
00:17:44,528 --> 00:17:48,020
- Know what they do to bitches
like you up in prison, huh?
- I'm not a bitch.

194
00:17:48,098 --> 00:17:50,623
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Stop, stop, stop. Let him go.

195
00:17:50,701 --> 00:17:54,159
Justin?

196
00:17:54,238 --> 00:17:56,968
Darnell?

197
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:02,034
- What was up with those guys?
- Uh, well, they thought you like little boys.

198
00:18:02,112 --> 00:18:04,012
Of course I like little boys.

199
00:18:04,081 --> 00:18:06,311
No, no. Like, they thought
you <i>like</i> little boys.

200
00:18:07,918 --> 00:18:10,386
- Oh, my God. That's so gnarly.
- Mm-hmm.

201
00:18:10,454 --> 00:18:12,388
Ew. Ew.

202
00:18:13,457 --> 00:18:16,358
- You want some chew?
- Nah. Go ahead, man.

203
00:18:19,797 --> 00:18:23,062
You hit your head real hard, huh?

204
00:18:23,133 --> 00:18:25,795
You should come over my house.
I'm hookin' up my Atari.

205
00:18:25,869 --> 00:18:28,201
It's gonna be awesome.

206
00:18:28,272 --> 00:18:31,298
Man, I miss you, dog. I miss you.
You my nigga!

207
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:35,044
Darnell, that's a bad word.

208
00:18:35,112 --> 00:18:38,570
Bitch, it's 2006!
You been sleepin' too long.

209
00:18:38,649 --> 00:18:41,083
After N.W.A. came out,
everybody's been sayin' it.

210
00:18:41,151 --> 00:18:44,416
- What-What's N.W.A.?
- Uh, Niggaz With Att-

211
00:18:44,488 --> 00:18:47,924
Look, don't worry about it.
It's like "my buddy," or "my friend."

212
00:18:49,827 --> 00:18:51,761
I'm sorry, Darnell.

213
00:18:51,829 --> 00:18:54,559
- I was in a coma.
- Yeah, you were.

214
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:58,199
You're a good nigger.

215
00:18:58,268 --> 00:19:01,169
You're the best nigger I ever had.

216
00:19:04,007 --> 00:19:06,771
Mmm, mmm, mmm!

217
00:19:06,844 --> 00:19:08,675
Nigga, get up, get up, get up.

218
00:19:13,817 --> 00:19:15,876
<i>Mrs. Schumacher, we can't give you a loan.</i>

219
00:19:15,953 --> 00:19:19,389
This bank has already extended itself
for you as far as it can.

220
00:19:21,158 --> 00:19:25,219
I don't- I don't think
you understand, um...

221
00:19:25,295 --> 00:19:27,263
the extent of Justin's
medical bills.

222
00:19:27,331 --> 00:19:31,199
They're gigantic. And, um,
I think we might be losing the house.

223
00:19:31,268 --> 00:19:34,965
<i>And, um,</i>
<i>I can't let that happen.</i>

224
00:19:35,038 --> 00:19:38,804
- I just- I don't-
- Hands are tied.

225
00:19:46,283 --> 00:19:48,547
I gotta pay my parents back.

226
00:19:50,554 --> 00:19:52,715
- <i>Whoa. Is this the new mall?</i>
- <i>This is it.</i>

227
00:19:52,789 --> 00:19:57,089
It's like Epcot Center.
Maybe I can get a job here.

228
00:19:58,662 --> 00:20:00,653
Holy crap!

229
00:20:00,731 --> 00:20:03,393
- What's goin' on here?
- Red leather, yellow leather.

230
00:20:03,467 --> 00:20:05,662
Yellow leather, red leather.

231
00:20:05,736 --> 00:20:08,227
Toy boat. Why isn't
my microphone working?

232
00:20:08,305 --> 00:20:10,933
They're shootin' a TV show. I heard of this.

233
00:20:11,008 --> 00:20:13,875
It's like <i>American Idol</i> for dancing.

234
00:20:13,944 --> 00:20:16,879
<i>America</i> what?

235
00:20:16,947 --> 00:20:20,405
<i>Star Search</i>. It's like <i>Star Search</i>.
For dancing.

236
00:20:20,484 --> 00:20:22,782
Okay. Stretch time's over.

237
00:20:24,888 --> 00:20:26,913
All right, girls.
Let's take it from the top.

238
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:32,455
Boy, they really didn't
stick that one.

239
00:20:39,002 --> 00:20:41,129
That's better.

240
00:20:41,204 --> 00:20:43,365
Oh-

241
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,340
It- It's Ju-
It's Ju-

242
00:20:45,409 --> 00:20:48,105
Ju-Just-

243
00:20:48,178 --> 00:20:51,409
Oh, my God! Justin! Oh, my God!
I can't believe my eyes!

244
00:20:51,481 --> 00:20:53,472
I never thought I'd see you again.

245
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:55,450
I never thought I'd-

246
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:58,980
Oh, my God.
You really grew up.

247
00:20:59,056 --> 00:21:00,990
I mean, a lot.

248
00:21:01,058 --> 00:21:03,026
- A lot, a lot.
- Uh-

249
00:21:03,093 --> 00:21:05,288
- Oh, my God.
- <i>Okay. You have to excuse him.</i>

250
00:21:05,362 --> 00:21:07,353
- I know I'm black, but I'm not invisible.
- <i>Oh, my God.</i>

251
00:21:07,431 --> 00:21:09,899
- I'm sorry, Darnell. I didn't mean to be rude.
- What's up, Jen?

252
00:21:09,967 --> 00:21:13,528
I-I'm good. I'm real good.
I'm the dance consultant for the new show.

253
00:21:13,603 --> 00:21:15,332
<i>Blue Lagoon!</i>

254
00:21:15,405 --> 00:21:20,707
We-We never got to
watch <i>Blue Lagoon</i>.

255
00:21:20,777 --> 00:21:23,712
- Betamax.
- Kapow!

256
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:26,476
<i>Whoo! Mmm, mmm.</i>

257
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:29,383
- <i>Kip, you remember Justin.</i>
- Nope.

258
00:21:32,456 --> 00:21:35,391
- Wait. Did you cut my lawn a few weeks ago?
- No.

259
00:21:35,459 --> 00:21:37,723
- Clean my pool?
- No.

260
00:21:39,663 --> 00:21:42,996
You're the jackass that flipped
off the stage when we were kids.

261
00:21:43,066 --> 00:21:46,263
<i>Oh, my God! I thought you were dead!</i>

262
00:21:46,336 --> 00:21:49,305
- Kip.
- What? Honey, he's like- Did you see his neck go-

263
00:21:49,373 --> 00:21:52,206
Like that. Holy sh- I can't believe it.

264
00:21:53,477 --> 00:21:55,445
Hey. Did you show him?
Look.

265
00:21:56,446 --> 00:21:58,380
- Oh, wrong finger. Look.
- Ow.

266
00:21:58,448 --> 00:22:00,382
We're engaged.

267
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:09,015
You okay?

268
00:22:09,092 --> 00:22:11,083
You look like you just
got punked, beyotch.

269
00:22:12,763 --> 00:22:16,290
Well, it was great
running into you, Dustin.

270
00:22:16,366 --> 00:22:18,357
Uh, here.

271
00:22:18,435 --> 00:22:20,426
Take a flyer.

272
00:22:21,638 --> 00:22:23,572
<i>So, do you have</i>
<i>a new phone number...</i>

273
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,471
or are ya still
livin' with mommy and daddy?

274
00:22:25,542 --> 00:22:28,033
- Still livin' with-
- I'm shocked!

275
00:22:28,979 --> 00:22:30,913
Well, we gotta run.
So, here.

276
00:22:30,981 --> 00:22:33,575
Why don't you say good-bye
to your new friend. Bye-bye.

277
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:36,813
Use that hand later for something,
huh, you little devil, you. Dick.

278
00:22:38,388 --> 00:22:42,586
<i>Let her go, man.</i>
<i>There's plenty of hiz-os in the hiz-ouse.</i>

279
00:22:42,659 --> 00:22:46,254
- Was he retarded before the coma?
- But Jen was my hiz-o.

280
00:22:46,329 --> 00:22:48,160
<i>Yeah.</i>

281
00:22:48,231 --> 00:22:50,131
But now she's "his-o."

282
00:22:53,236 --> 00:22:55,204
No.

283
00:22:55,272 --> 00:22:57,536
All I gotta do is dog him
on the dance floor.

284
00:22:57,607 --> 00:22:59,939
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Justin, no, no. Justin!

285
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:02,444
<i>Justin. Justin!</i>
<i>No, no!</i>

286
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:06,974
<i>Oh, God.</i>
<i>He look like a chicken.</i>

287
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:10,110
<i>Justin, no! No!</i>

288
00:23:10,187 --> 00:23:12,121
<i>Justin, you're still weak!</i>

289
00:23:12,189 --> 00:23:15,955
- Watch this, hiz-o.
- <i>What in the hell is he doin'?</i>

290
00:23:16,026 --> 00:23:17,789
Y'all know him?

291
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:26,128
Security.

292
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:31,735
Don't feed the animal.

293
00:23:31,808 --> 00:23:34,140
I mean- I mean, come on.

294
00:23:34,211 --> 00:23:36,611
I hate everyone.

295
00:23:41,051 --> 00:23:44,043
- What are you doin'?
- Killing myself.

296
00:23:44,121 --> 00:23:47,613
- With Pop Rocks and a soda?
- Yeah.

297
00:23:49,092 --> 00:23:51,219
Let me have it, Justin.

298
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,595
Ahhh.

299
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,208
- Hey.
- I'm kidding, Justin.

300
00:24:05,275 --> 00:24:07,209
See? You won't die.

301
00:24:07,277 --> 00:24:09,575
- But Mikey.
- It never happened.

302
00:24:10,981 --> 00:24:14,041
You have a better chance
of slittin' your wrist with this.

303
00:24:14,117 --> 00:24:16,847
Come on, man.
Look at you.

304
00:24:18,088 --> 00:24:19,749
Where's the Rocket Shoe?

305
00:24:21,791 --> 00:24:24,589
Hey, wait.

306
00:24:24,661 --> 00:24:26,891
Did you read this?

307
00:24:26,963 --> 00:24:29,193
"Get 2 Steppin' Crew Edition.

308
00:24:29,266 --> 00:24:31,632
"Compete for the grand prize
of a one-year contract...

310
00:24:37,641 --> 00:24:40,974
Oh, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no. Hell no.

311
00:24:41,044 --> 00:24:44,445
- Hell no, Justin.
- No, D-Darnell, it's the only way.

312
00:24:44,514 --> 00:24:47,483
We win the contest,
I get the money to pay back my parents...

313
00:24:47,551 --> 00:24:50,611
we stuff Kip so hard
that Jen has to come back to me.

314
00:24:50,687 --> 00:24:53,178
Darnell, you know what we gotta do?

315
00:24:53,256 --> 00:24:56,020
We gotta get the Funky Fresh Boyz
back together.

316
00:24:56,092 --> 00:24:58,026
Ow!

317
00:24:58,094 --> 00:24:59,959
Didn't I say "hell no"?

318
00:25:02,132 --> 00:25:04,225
Why are you so angry?

319
00:25:05,435 --> 00:25:07,369
- No.
- Please.

320
00:25:07,437 --> 00:25:09,428
Will you stop sayin'
"please," please?

321
00:25:09,506 --> 00:25:11,940
<i>Venus, Serena, say hi to Justin</i>
<i>before I beat his ass.</i>

322
00:25:12,008 --> 00:25:13,942
I didn't know you had kids.

323
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:15,534
- <i>They ain't mine.</i>
- Huh?

324
00:25:15,612 --> 00:25:18,979
Why y'all just sittin' here?
Why y'all didn't clean up the house?

325
00:25:19,049 --> 00:25:20,573
Cockroach!

326
00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:23,414
Hold, hold, hold, hold, hold.
Stop, stop, stop, stop. Relax. Relax.

327
00:25:23,486 --> 00:25:25,078
<i>Relax. Relax.</i>

328
00:25:25,155 --> 00:25:27,487
It's not a real roach.

329
00:25:27,557 --> 00:25:31,493
It's one of my inventions.
You remember when we were kids...

330
00:25:31,561 --> 00:25:34,826
- they had those toys called
the Wacky Wall Walkers?
- Yeah.

331
00:25:34,898 --> 00:25:37,662
You could grab it, throw it against the wall.
It would stick and crawl down-

332
00:25:37,734 --> 00:25:40,567
- Right. You know how much
the guy who invented that made?
- How much?

333
00:25:40,637 --> 00:25:42,969
- A hundred million dollars.
- Get out.

334
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:46,440
Yes. A hundred million dollars
for a stupid Super Ball with snot on it.

335
00:25:46,509 --> 00:25:50,104
And you think the next
Wacky Wall Walker is?

336
00:25:52,749 --> 00:25:55,616
The Ghetto Wall-Grabber.

337
00:25:57,053 --> 00:25:59,487
Here. Try it.

338
00:25:59,556 --> 00:26:01,854
Throw it right up against the wall.
It just goes-

339
00:26:01,925 --> 00:26:03,916
comin' down the wall.

340
00:26:09,099 --> 00:26:12,091
Wow, that's cool. That sticks.
Wow, it's like a real roach. It-

341
00:26:12,168 --> 00:26:15,194
Yep. I'll sell a million
of those in Atlanta.

342
00:26:15,272 --> 00:26:17,502
So what's stopping you
from making your millions?

343
00:26:17,574 --> 00:26:21,340
$10,000 in seed money.
That's what I need to get started.

344
00:26:21,411 --> 00:26:23,470
And as you can see,
that ain't happening around here.

345
00:26:23,546 --> 00:26:26,743
<i>Every time that stupid girl watch a video,</i>
<i>she have another baby.</i>

346
00:26:26,816 --> 00:26:28,977
Hmm. $10,000.
Seed money.

347
00:26:29,052 --> 00:26:31,111
Hmm. I wonder where
you could get that.

348
00:26:31,187 --> 00:26:33,883
Uh, Justin.

349
00:26:33,957 --> 00:26:36,187
<i>Uh, Justin.</i>

350
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:42,857
- <i>Darnell.</i>
- Hey, Boo.

351
00:26:42,932 --> 00:26:44,991
You got your hair did.
It looks real good.

352
00:26:45,068 --> 00:26:47,059
- You bring the diapers?
- <i>They're right there. Hey, Tiger Woods!</i>

353
00:26:47,137 --> 00:26:48,832
- Where?
- Right there, sweetie.

354
00:26:48,905 --> 00:26:52,272
Is that all you got?
Boy, this ain't gonna last more than two days.

355
00:26:52,342 --> 00:26:55,209
It'd last a long time
if they didn't doo-doo so much.

356
00:26:55,278 --> 00:26:58,304
- I'm sorry, baby. I didn't have no more money.
- You ain't got no more money.

357
00:26:58,381 --> 00:27:01,043
How come every time
I ask you for something you ain't got money?

358
00:27:01,117 --> 00:27:03,551
But when you need to buy parts and shit
for your little inventions...

359
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:05,850
you got more money than 50 Cent?

360
00:27:05,922 --> 00:27:07,913
Like this.

361
00:27:07,991 --> 00:27:09,549
What is this? What?

362
00:27:09,626 --> 00:27:12,823
It's an automatic jean tight-roller.

363
00:27:12,896 --> 00:27:15,558
Ain't nobody tight-rollin'
their jeans no more, fool!

364
00:27:15,632 --> 00:27:17,190
But, baby, this one's automatic.

365
00:27:17,267 --> 00:27:19,792
I don't care if it's automatic,
systematic, Veg-O-Matic.

366
00:27:19,869 --> 00:27:21,803
I don't give a shit-o-matic.

367
00:27:21,871 --> 00:27:24,863
Ain't nobody tight-rollin'
their jeans no more.

368
00:27:27,344 --> 00:27:28,834
Excuse me, ma'am.

369
00:27:28,912 --> 00:27:31,403
Who the hell are you?

370
00:27:31,481 --> 00:27:34,177
I know a way Darnell could get
enough money to make his inventions...

371
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:37,185
- and keep your kids in diapers
for the rest of their lives.
- No.

372
00:27:39,089 --> 00:27:41,023
Damn, baby!

373
00:27:41,091 --> 00:27:44,322
- I can't dance like that no more.
I'm a grown-ass man!
- For a hundred grand?

374
00:27:44,394 --> 00:27:47,192
You better bust a move,
drop it like it's hot.

375
00:27:47,263 --> 00:27:51,324
Now, I don't want to see your black ass again
until you got a whole lot of money...

376
00:27:51,401 --> 00:27:53,392
or a whole lot of diapers.

377
00:27:55,505 --> 00:27:58,633
Oh, hell no.
You don't close my door like that.

378
00:27:58,708 --> 00:28:01,700
- What you say, nigga?
- Uh, nothin'. I'm your nigga.

379
00:28:01,778 --> 00:28:03,712
Now get to steppin'.

380
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:05,907
- I'm goin', baby.
- Bitch-slapped.

381
00:28:05,982 --> 00:28:08,974
- You too.
- I'm gonna step. I-I will step. Thank you.

382
00:28:10,053 --> 00:28:12,214
I ain't playin' with you.

383
00:28:12,288 --> 00:28:14,313
Man, I hope you know
what the hell you're doin'.

384
00:28:14,391 --> 00:28:18,088
Oh, I know what we're doing. We're getting
the Funky Fresh Boyz back together.

385
00:28:22,031 --> 00:28:25,933
- Is this the right place?
- Yeah. His mom said he comin' by here any second.

386
00:28:26,002 --> 00:28:27,936
What is that?

387
00:28:29,072 --> 00:28:30,835
Is that Hector?

388
00:28:37,313 --> 00:28:39,281
Or some dude that ate Hector.

389
00:28:39,349 --> 00:28:42,807
- <i>Man.</i>
- <i>That nigga about a six piece with extra biscuits.</i>

390
00:28:45,355 --> 00:28:47,255
Damn, that nigga big.

391
00:28:47,323 --> 00:28:49,314
You gotta move this car
before I have it towed.

392
00:28:52,929 --> 00:28:54,863
Mr. Jackson?

393
00:28:55,865 --> 00:28:58,527
Darnell Jackson?

394
00:28:58,601 --> 00:29:00,466
Hector!

395
00:29:02,372 --> 00:29:04,636
And you know who this
comatose bitch is, right?

396
00:29:04,707 --> 00:29:06,641
<i>No way! Justin!</i>

397
00:29:06,709 --> 00:29:09,303
- Hey, buddy.
- I can't believe it! Oh, my God!

398
00:29:09,379 --> 00:29:10,846
You're alive!

399
00:29:12,749 --> 00:29:15,445
Okay, okay, okay.
Hector, Hector.

400
00:29:15,518 --> 00:29:18,282
- Oh, man.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait a minute. Wait.

401
00:29:18,354 --> 00:29:20,652
- How long have you been a meter bitch?
- Traffic warden.

402
00:29:20,723 --> 00:29:22,020
<i>Few years.</i>

403
00:29:22,091 --> 00:29:25,288
Rough times out here
in the streets of the Valley.

404
00:29:25,361 --> 00:29:28,057
818 ain't no joke.

405
00:29:28,131 --> 00:29:30,622
I've been shot at.
I've been peed on.

406
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:33,567
- What?
- But I helped a lot of people.

407
00:29:33,636 --> 00:29:36,867
Man, you the meter bitch.
Who you help?

408
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:39,170
Uh- Hmm.

409
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:47,648
Oh! I once let David Hasselhoff
out of a ticket.

410
00:29:47,717 --> 00:29:51,209
You know, he sometimes drives around L.A.
in a full replica of KITT.

411
00:29:51,287 --> 00:29:52,754
Wow.

412
00:29:52,822 --> 00:29:55,416
Yeah, right?

413
00:29:55,492 --> 00:29:57,687
We're gettin' the Funky Fresh Boyz
back together...

414
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,354
and we need
Hector "Popcorn" Jimenez.

415
00:30:01,931 --> 00:30:04,923
- I don't know, guys.
- It's okay. We understand. You're too busy.

416
00:30:05,001 --> 00:30:08,095
We know you gotta get up in the morning
and eat a Krispy Kreme burrito.

417
00:30:08,171 --> 00:30:10,696
Just 'cause I'm fat
doesn't mean I can't break.

418
00:30:12,175 --> 00:30:14,336
Check this out.

419
00:30:39,866 --> 00:30:42,767
You know break-dancing burns
a lot of calories, right?

420
00:30:44,571 --> 00:30:48,871
Now, if Aki's a quadriplegic,
we're gettin' somewhere.

421
00:30:48,942 --> 00:30:52,571
Sorry, guys.
I have a real job now.

422
00:30:52,645 --> 00:30:55,637
There is no frickin' way
I'm joining a break-dance squad.

423
00:30:55,715 --> 00:30:58,206
Wait. Why? Why are you
talkin' like that?

424
00:30:58,284 --> 00:31:01,014
Like what? All negative? I-

425
00:31:01,087 --> 00:31:05,217
<i>No. Like, um- You- Um-</i>

426
00:31:05,291 --> 00:31:08,556
You know. You know.
You used to-

427
00:31:08,628 --> 00:31:11,256
Come on, bitch.
Say "booty twaps"!

428
00:31:12,332 --> 00:31:14,266
It's booby traps.

429
00:31:14,334 --> 00:31:16,996
- No, but say "booty twaps" 'cause it's awesome.
- No.

430
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:19,561
Please.
Aki, I was in a coma.

431
00:31:22,875 --> 00:31:24,809
Okay.

432
00:31:24,877 --> 00:31:26,811
Booty twaps.

433
00:31:29,115 --> 00:31:31,083
I love it when you do that!

434
00:31:36,189 --> 00:31:38,350
I love it when you say that!

435
00:31:38,424 --> 00:31:40,858
You look so stupid!

436
00:31:44,697 --> 00:31:48,963
It's funny! Asian guy funny!
The yellow guy!

437
00:31:49,035 --> 00:31:51,367
I knew it.
I knew it.

438
00:31:51,437 --> 00:31:54,372
I was never your friend.
I was your damn mascot.

439
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:58,206
Your little Ewok, Mogwai,
Golden Child, Mr. Miyagi.

440
00:31:58,278 --> 00:31:59,939
<i>Wax on, wax off, huh?</i>

441
00:32:00,013 --> 00:32:03,540
Yeah.
No.

442
00:32:03,616 --> 00:32:07,108
You know, I was at that school for a year
before you guys talked to me.

443
00:32:07,186 --> 00:32:10,451
Then came a little movie called
<i>Sixteen</i> frickin' <i>Candles</i>.

444
00:32:10,523 --> 00:32:13,151
The second I saw it,
I knew what was coming the next day.

445
00:32:13,226 --> 00:32:17,788
200 kids begging me to say,
"Ooh, sexy girlfriend.

446
00:32:17,864 --> 00:32:20,298
What's happenin', hot stuff?"

447
00:32:26,539 --> 00:32:28,473
"Get in that foxhole, gook!"

448
00:32:28,541 --> 00:32:31,738
Mao! Mao! Mao!

449
00:32:31,811 --> 00:32:33,676
No!

450
00:32:33,746 --> 00:32:36,806
You frickin' round eyes
ate it up for 10 years.

451
00:32:36,883 --> 00:32:40,546
Round eye? I'm Mexican, <i>ese</i>.
These are bean shape.

452
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:44,647
Ten years of taking advantage
of my accent because...

453
00:32:44,724 --> 00:32:48,558
"Indy, I 'ruv' you" and "robster craws"
is so damn funny.

454
00:32:49,996 --> 00:32:51,588
<i>Not anymore.</i>

455
00:32:51,664 --> 00:32:56,033
Thanks to thousands
in speech therapy, I talk like this.

456
00:32:56,102 --> 00:33:00,368
I act like this.
I... blend in.

457
00:33:02,975 --> 00:33:04,670
Do you have any extra 2111s?

458
00:33:08,581 --> 00:33:10,572
Hi, Yun.

459
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:16,679
I'm Jewish.

460
00:33:19,325 --> 00:33:21,589
Damn, Aki.
You blendin' in real good.

461
00:33:21,661 --> 00:33:23,720
She didn't even know
your ass was here.

462
00:33:23,796 --> 00:33:25,229
Uh, excuse me. Uh, Lucy Liu.

463
00:33:25,298 --> 00:33:27,766
<i>Don't!</i>

464
00:33:27,834 --> 00:33:30,132
Relax. I got you, dog.
Uh, excuse me, geisha.

465
00:33:30,203 --> 00:33:33,036
Do you have any idea who it was
you just corresponded with here?

466
00:33:33,106 --> 00:33:35,040
No.

467
00:33:35,108 --> 00:33:40,136
Uh, what percentage in chance does my friend,
Aki, have of sleeping with you?

468
00:33:40,213 --> 00:33:43,239
Zero percent.

469
00:33:43,316 --> 00:33:47,753
<i>One more question, please.</i>
<i>What if he's a professional break-dancer?</i>

470
00:33:50,623 --> 00:33:53,114
Two percent.

471
00:33:53,192 --> 00:33:55,490
Mathematically that's
an infinity percent increase.

472
00:33:55,561 --> 00:33:58,587
Yes! That's my Aki!

473
00:33:58,664 --> 00:34:00,461
- Homeboys forever?
- Uh-huh.

474
00:34:00,533 --> 00:34:03,468
- Homeboys forever.
- Homeboys forever.

475
00:34:03,536 --> 00:34:05,163
- <i>Homeboys forever.</i>
- Yeah!

476
00:34:05,238 --> 00:34:07,934
Funky Fresh Boyz!

477
00:34:09,342 --> 00:34:11,401
If that's what you guys
are gonna call yourselves...

478
00:34:11,477 --> 00:34:13,809
it goes back down to one percent.

479
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:16,212
- One percent is still good.
- Yeah.

480
00:34:16,282 --> 00:34:18,443
- Yeah.
- Better than zero.

481
00:34:18,518 --> 00:34:20,816
Fuck you, Mr. Ferguson!

482
00:34:20,887 --> 00:34:23,014
I'm kidding.
I still need this job.

483
00:34:25,191 --> 00:34:26,123
Oh!

484
00:34:26,192 --> 00:34:28,092
- Geez.
- What the heck, lady?

485
00:34:29,228 --> 00:34:31,662
- I'm sorry. I didn't-
- Crazy-Wha-

486
00:34:31,731 --> 00:34:33,665
- Jen.
- Justin.

487
00:34:35,668 --> 00:34:37,533
What are you doin' here?

488
00:34:37,603 --> 00:34:39,298
What's all this?

489
00:34:39,372 --> 00:34:42,170
Oh. We're getting the Boyz
back together for your contest.

490
00:34:42,241 --> 00:34:43,936
Cool.

491
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:46,478
You ever think about updating a bit?

492
00:34:46,546 --> 00:34:48,480
These clothes are pretty old-school.

493
00:34:48,548 --> 00:34:51,142
I only ever went to one school.

494
00:34:51,217 --> 00:34:53,617
And those moves are wack.

495
00:34:53,686 --> 00:34:55,677
What you talkin' about, Jen?

496
00:34:55,755 --> 00:34:59,191
If I went beat boy right here, I'd have a crowd
around me in two funky seconds.

497
00:34:59,258 --> 00:35:01,783
'Cause everyone would want to see
a real-life time machine.

498
00:35:01,861 --> 00:35:04,830
- Is that a challenge?
- No, it's really not a challenge.

499
00:35:05,998 --> 00:35:07,989
Yo, deejay!

500
00:35:08,067 --> 00:35:10,297
I'm deejay?

501
00:35:10,369 --> 00:35:12,064
Give me a beat!

502
00:35:12,138 --> 00:35:13,730
I have beet.

503
00:35:13,806 --> 00:35:15,330
No. Please don't.

504
00:35:15,408 --> 00:35:17,399
Oh. Oh.

505
00:35:21,714 --> 00:35:24,080
God!

506
00:35:26,786 --> 00:35:28,913
What's wrong with that?
Persian classic, man!

507
00:35:32,091 --> 00:35:34,218
Yes. Okay.

508
00:35:35,628 --> 00:35:37,391
Hey!

509
00:35:37,463 --> 00:35:40,728
That's my house!

510
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:44,896
Hey, that shiny man stole my house!

511
00:35:44,971 --> 00:35:47,030
<i>What the-</i>

512
00:35:47,106 --> 00:35:50,007
Hey, shiny man.

513
00:35:50,076 --> 00:35:52,544
- You break-dance?
- Yeah.

514
00:35:52,612 --> 00:35:55,172
Back in the day,
I was the break-dance bomb.

515
00:35:55,248 --> 00:35:59,514
<i>They used to call me</i>
<i>Ca-Ca-Ca-Ca-Ca-Carl.</i>

516
00:36:00,953 --> 00:36:02,784
Deejay!

517
00:36:02,855 --> 00:36:06,723
I'm not deejay.

518
00:36:22,441 --> 00:36:24,773
Oh, I feel-

519
00:36:34,654 --> 00:36:37,088
Yo, Hammer pants.
What brought that on?

520
00:36:37,156 --> 00:36:41,923
There just comes a time when we heed a certain
call when the world must come together as one.

521
00:36:44,497 --> 00:36:46,488
Wow.

522
00:36:47,633 --> 00:36:49,624
I missed you.

523
00:36:51,671 --> 00:36:54,572
I should get going.

524
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:57,074
Yeah. Me too.

525
00:36:57,143 --> 00:36:58,906
Okay?

526
00:36:58,978 --> 00:37:01,811
- Thanks for the advice.
- You know. Anytime.

527
00:37:01,881 --> 00:37:03,815
- I'll call you.
- Yeah.

528
00:37:03,883 --> 00:37:07,785
<i>Okay, guys. We're gonna need to update</i>
<i>our style since the last time we performed.</i>

529
00:37:07,853 --> 00:37:12,153
We need to start by updating
these freakin' parachute pants!

530
00:37:16,696 --> 00:37:20,325
- Ain't nobody wearin' parachute pants no more.
- Parachute pants are timeless.

531
00:37:20,399 --> 00:37:22,128
<i>Fine.</i>

532
00:37:22,201 --> 00:37:24,931
Let's just go through
the old AppleJack 2012 routine.

533
00:37:25,004 --> 00:37:27,302
- Uh, no.
- Yeah.

534
00:37:27,373 --> 00:37:30,342
Come on, man.

535
00:37:30,409 --> 00:37:34,004
Ready?
Five, six, seven, eight.

536
00:37:36,449 --> 00:37:38,383
Oh, man!

537
00:37:38,451 --> 00:37:40,612
What the hell are you doin'?
Which way you gonna go?

538
00:37:40,686 --> 00:37:42,620
You're f-in' me up.
I'm supposed to go left.

539
00:37:42,688 --> 00:37:45,384
Half of you did go left.
But the other half went right.

540
00:37:45,458 --> 00:37:48,859
- <i>How many halves you got?</i>
- Guys, come on. Let-

541
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:51,294
Let's just start with something
a little simpler, okay?

542
00:37:51,364 --> 00:37:53,298
Let's just start with the robot.

543
00:37:53,366 --> 00:37:55,300
Okay? All right.

544
00:37:55,368 --> 00:37:57,996
Remember, guys.
You're like a mannequin. Okay?

545
00:38:06,812 --> 00:38:10,179
Whoa, whoa. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait.
Aki, what the hell are you doin'?

546
00:38:10,249 --> 00:38:12,581
Come on, man.
The robot's supposed to be your thing.

547
00:38:12,652 --> 00:38:15,985
You look like C-3PO with R2-D2
stuck up his ass.

548
00:38:16,055 --> 00:38:19,218
Shut up! They don't do this anymore.

549
00:38:19,291 --> 00:38:22,852
Guys, this is serious. We need to win this contest.

550
00:38:22,928 --> 00:38:26,227
- And we can't let anything stand in our way.
- Hey. Who wants cookies?

551
00:38:26,298 --> 00:38:29,495
Mom! You're ruining everything.

552
00:38:29,568 --> 00:38:32,537
Justin Allen, what could I possibly
be ruining?

553
00:38:32,605 --> 00:38:34,539
- Oh, oh.
- How many you need?

554
00:38:34,607 --> 00:38:37,576
You have a girl on the phone for you.

555
00:38:37,643 --> 00:38:39,577
Shut up!

556
00:38:39,645 --> 00:38:42,512
Shut up!

557
00:38:43,816 --> 00:38:45,750
- Hello.
- Justin.

558
00:38:45,818 --> 00:38:49,049
- Hi, Jen.
- Do you have VH1 on?

559
00:38:49,121 --> 00:38:51,919
Uh, n-Yeah. No.

560
00:38:51,991 --> 00:38:54,186
Oh. Turn it down!

561
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:56,194
Hi.

562
00:38:56,262 --> 00:38:59,197
You are so lucky you missed out
when that song was popular.

563
00:38:59,265 --> 00:39:01,233
That and "Whoomp! There It Is."

564
00:39:03,202 --> 00:39:06,467
Listen. Kip's throwing
this big party for the show.

565
00:39:06,539 --> 00:39:08,871
You should come.
It's a pretty fun club.

566
00:39:08,941 --> 00:39:11,705
I was in D&D Club.

567
00:39:11,777 --> 00:39:13,768
Oh, it's not that kind of club?

568
00:39:30,730 --> 00:39:32,721
<i>Justin!</i>

569
00:39:32,798 --> 00:39:35,392
I'm so glad you came.

570
00:39:35,468 --> 00:39:37,561
How do you like this place?

571
00:39:41,574 --> 00:39:43,735
Don't worry.
I learned about this in school.

572
00:39:45,311 --> 00:39:47,336
Justin?

573
00:39:48,748 --> 00:39:51,842
- You're having a seizure.
Don't swallow your tongue.
- <i>Justin!</i>

574
00:39:51,917 --> 00:39:54,317
- Don't swallow it.
- Justin, get up off the man.

575
00:39:54,386 --> 00:39:56,911
- He's krumping.
- <i>Get out of here!</i>

576
00:39:56,989 --> 00:39:59,082
Get a real wallet!

577
00:39:59,158 --> 00:40:01,456
Waterproof. Jealous?

578
00:40:04,263 --> 00:40:06,197
Hey. The crapper's
right around the corner.

579
00:40:06,265 --> 00:40:09,200
- Yeah. You can't miss it. It says "W"-
- Hey, Kip. Look who I found.

580
00:40:09,268 --> 00:40:11,702
What? Hey!
Senor Coma.

581
00:40:11,771 --> 00:40:14,331
Say, isn't it past your bedtime?

582
00:40:14,406 --> 00:40:17,705
No. Mom said I could
stay out till midnight.

583
00:40:17,777 --> 00:40:20,507
Whoa! Holy smokes, Jen.
Midnight, huh?

584
00:40:20,579 --> 00:40:23,707
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- Is your mom gonna be waiting
for you in the station wagon?

585
00:40:23,783 --> 00:40:26,183
- No. I rode my bike.
- He's got a bike.

586
00:40:26,252 --> 00:40:29,653
That's pretty cool. I had a bike. Do you have,
uh, the, uh, streamers on the handlebars?

587
00:40:29,722 --> 00:40:31,952
Or how about the baseball cards
in the spokes? Remember those?

588
00:40:34,426 --> 00:40:37,884
- Kip, stop it.
- I had a bike, Jen. I was just kidding with him.

589
00:40:37,963 --> 00:40:40,193
- I got mags.
- You're a fag.

590
00:40:40,266 --> 00:40:42,257
Hey, Andrew McCarthy.
Jen, I'll be right back.

591
00:40:42,334 --> 00:40:45,861
Hey. Why don't you go to the bar
and get us a drink.

592
00:40:45,938 --> 00:40:48,805
Well, do they have fruit punch?

593
00:40:48,874 --> 00:40:52,469
<i>The fruitiest.</i>
<i>Delicious.</i>

594
00:40:52,545 --> 00:40:54,308
- Sounds good.
- Delicious.

595
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:57,838
Here's lookin' at you, kid.

596
00:41:01,253 --> 00:41:03,517
You're a jerk.

597
00:41:03,589 --> 00:41:05,147
Hey.

598
00:41:09,228 --> 00:41:11,924
- Frontsies.
- Get away from me.

599
00:41:15,334 --> 00:41:17,359
Frontsies.

600
00:41:18,637 --> 00:41:20,571
No.

601
00:41:20,639 --> 00:41:22,630
Backsies.

602
00:41:34,954 --> 00:41:37,286
- You havin' some fun yet?
- This place is okay.

603
00:41:37,356 --> 00:41:39,290
There's nothin' to do.

604
00:41:39,358 --> 00:41:43,055
<i>Shut up. All right. Look around you.</i>
<i>This place is freakin' amazing.</i>

605
00:41:43,128 --> 00:41:46,188
I'm gonna have a birthday party
at Chim E. Changa's. That place is awesome.

606
00:41:46,265 --> 00:41:48,756
You wanna have fun?

607
00:41:48,834 --> 00:41:51,962
<i>Learn to dance like the brother.</i>
<i>I can help you out. Here.</i>

608
00:41:52,037 --> 00:41:53,971
Taste some of this.

609
00:41:54,039 --> 00:41:56,030
Gives you wings, buddy.

610
00:41:59,211 --> 00:42:02,442
Whoa.
It tastes like a laser.

611
00:42:03,616 --> 00:42:05,607
Mmm.

612
00:42:17,129 --> 00:42:20,155
<i>Justin. Justin.</i>

613
00:42:20,232 --> 00:42:22,166
<i>Justin.</i>

614
00:42:22,234 --> 00:42:26,466
- Come on, baby. Justin.
- Emmanuel Lewis?

615
00:42:26,538 --> 00:42:28,836
What are you doin' here?

616
00:42:28,908 --> 00:42:30,967
Mackin' hos.

617
00:42:31,043 --> 00:42:35,946
- You mack hos?
- I mack hos five nights a week, trick.

618
00:42:36,015 --> 00:42:38,643
You ain't never seen
none of my home videos?

619
00:42:38,717 --> 00:42:40,446
Dang.

620
00:42:40,519 --> 00:42:43,488
- Whoo!
- Ooh!

621
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:47,181
<i>Justin.</i>

622
00:42:48,427 --> 00:42:50,190
Jen.

623
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:53,527
Justin, should I call you a cab?

624
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:56,124
Don't call me a cab.
You're a cab.

625
00:42:57,503 --> 00:43:00,370
I missed you so much,
my little angel hair pasta.

626
00:43:00,439 --> 00:43:02,873
Yes, I'm a jerk.
I'm a- I'm a jerk.

627
00:43:09,715 --> 00:43:12,013
Justin, we're gonna go.

628
00:43:12,084 --> 00:43:14,018
You suck.

629
00:43:15,654 --> 00:43:17,986
I gotta go home.

630
00:43:22,294 --> 00:43:25,127
Somebody's in here.

631
00:43:25,197 --> 00:43:27,222
Okay. Okay!

632
00:43:27,299 --> 00:43:29,130
All right then.

633
00:43:29,201 --> 00:43:34,070
Justin, your father and I are not happy
with the way you have been acting.

634
00:43:34,139 --> 00:43:37,700
Coming in at all hours. And you cannot
sit still for longer than two seconds.

635
00:43:37,776 --> 00:43:41,075
It's like you're a 12-year-old
stuck in a 30-year-old body.

636
00:43:41,146 --> 00:43:43,046
Yeah. And you have seriously
f'ed up my TiVo.

637
00:43:44,984 --> 00:43:47,782
We know you have started
break-dancing again.

638
00:43:47,853 --> 00:43:49,787
And, frankly, we have
enough money problems...

639
00:43:49,855 --> 00:43:53,382
without worrying about you cracking
your head open doing that head spin thing.

640
00:43:53,459 --> 00:43:56,155
I'm not doing head spins.
And-And I can help with the money.

641
00:43:56,228 --> 00:43:59,254
- I just need more time.
- Is time gonna buy me a new TiVo?

642
00:43:59,331 --> 00:44:03,165
Oh, my God!
Will you shut up about the TiVo!

643
00:44:03,235 --> 00:44:05,169
- Jesus Christ!
- It's broken!

644
00:44:05,237 --> 00:44:09,901
<i>Okay, honey. We went</i>
<i>and we had a little talk with Dr. Fry.</i>

645
00:44:09,975 --> 00:44:14,571
And he, um- he gave us some medicine
to maybe help you settle down.

646
00:44:14,646 --> 00:44:17,581
And it's called Ritalin.

647
00:44:18,650 --> 00:44:20,743
Oh, God, no. Skin.

648
00:44:20,819 --> 00:44:23,447
You'd rather me take drugs
than be funky fresh?

649
00:44:23,522 --> 00:44:25,114
<i>What is wrong with you people?</i>

650
00:44:25,190 --> 00:44:27,181
Just leave me alone!

651
00:44:33,829 --> 00:44:37,959
- I think I'm gonna take a couple of these.
- Knock yourself out.

652
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:39,761
I know what the next big fad is.

653
00:44:39,835 --> 00:44:42,736
- You remember the Rubik's Cube?
- Yes.

654
00:44:42,805 --> 00:44:45,740
- You remember it, right?
- Yes.

655
00:44:45,808 --> 00:44:48,242
Okay. I came up with
my own Rubik's Cube.

656
00:44:48,310 --> 00:44:51,438
Except I put in a little culture.
Check it out.

657
00:44:55,117 --> 00:44:59,315
Now presenting...
the Jewbik's Cube!

658
00:45:00,890 --> 00:45:04,087
I'll sell a million
of these in Israel.

659
00:45:06,128 --> 00:45:10,497
Jewish star, a money sign,
a menorah and a d-

660
00:45:11,867 --> 00:45:14,427
Dude, you put a dick
on the Jewbik's Cube?

661
00:45:20,209 --> 00:45:22,336
- <i>Give me that.</i>
- You loser.

662
00:45:22,411 --> 00:45:25,175
It's a circumcised penis.

663
00:45:25,247 --> 00:45:27,943
The only other real Jewish thing
I could think of.

664
00:45:31,053 --> 00:45:34,955
<i>Hey, Justin. So what are</i>
<i>we working on today?</i>

665
00:45:35,024 --> 00:45:37,857
Aki, do the robot.

666
00:45:38,928 --> 00:45:40,987
How you used to.

667
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:53,434
Stop.

668
00:45:53,509 --> 00:45:55,807
Stop.

669
00:45:55,878 --> 00:45:57,641
Stop!

670
00:45:59,148 --> 00:46:01,480
Aki, it's time
to say <i>domo arigato</i>...

671
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:03,950
<i>and find your inner Roboto.</i>

672
00:46:04,019 --> 00:46:06,010
- <i>Domo.</i>
- <i>Domo.</i>

673
00:46:06,088 --> 00:46:07,555
- <i>Domo.</i>
- <i>Domo.</i>

674
00:46:07,623 --> 00:46:10,114
But I can't show you the way.

675
00:46:12,661 --> 00:46:14,652
But he can.

676
00:46:19,401 --> 00:46:21,699
Justin, this is ridiculous.

677
00:46:21,771 --> 00:46:25,639
Shoot, we ain't losin' a hundred grand
because of you. Just do the damn thing.

678
00:46:25,708 --> 00:46:28,643
Before I punch you in the head
like a Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robot.

679
00:46:37,386 --> 00:46:39,911
<i>What in the hell is that?</i>

680
00:46:39,989 --> 00:46:43,049
This is robo-retarded.
I can't do it.

681
00:46:43,125 --> 00:46:47,084
<i>Listen, guys.</i>
<i>We may have gotten old...</i>

682
00:46:47,163 --> 00:46:50,064
or forgotten what we love...

683
00:46:50,132 --> 00:46:52,396
or even been in a coma.

684
00:46:53,435 --> 00:46:56,927
But starting today, right now...

685
00:46:57,006 --> 00:47:00,066
we remember who we are.

686
00:47:00,142 --> 00:47:04,511
'Cause we are the Funky Fresh Boyz.

687
00:48:32,768 --> 00:48:34,861
Jen, we're gonna be late.

688
00:48:40,376 --> 00:48:43,174
This is not happening.

689
00:48:45,014 --> 00:48:48,381
<i>All right.</i>

690
00:48:48,450 --> 00:48:52,011
I need you to tell me
everything you know...

691
00:48:52,087 --> 00:48:54,214
about the female anatomy.

692
00:49:00,429 --> 00:49:04,058
I think it's time I introduced you
to a little thing called...

693
00:49:05,067 --> 00:49:07,058
the Internet.

694
00:49:09,071 --> 00:49:13,838
And that covers about, oh,
one-trillionth of everything.

695
00:49:13,909 --> 00:49:16,537
Huh? Huh?

696
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:20,613
Justin. Justin.

697
00:49:22,084 --> 00:49:24,143
By the power of Grayskull.

698
00:49:25,187 --> 00:49:27,246
Bodies aren't supposed to-

699
00:49:27,323 --> 00:49:30,190
Midget. Cheese Whiz.

700
00:49:31,327 --> 00:49:34,125
That's not how you play Twister.

701
00:49:34,196 --> 00:49:36,130
Ooh, I didn't see that one yet.
Click it.

702
00:49:36,198 --> 00:49:37,688
- No, no, no.
- Click it.

703
00:49:37,766 --> 00:49:39,165
- No, no, no.
- Click. Click.

704
00:49:39,234 --> 00:49:41,327
Calm down, nigga.
You just hit puberty.

705
00:49:41,403 --> 00:49:46,431
Okay. Now, what we need to do
is come up with a plan.

706
00:49:46,508 --> 00:49:48,442
Okay? 'Cause
if we ain't got a-

707
00:49:48,510 --> 00:49:50,501
Damn. She got a nice ass.

708
00:49:50,579 --> 00:49:52,513
Click it.

709
00:50:06,161 --> 00:50:08,789
<i>You guys are Cole's crew, right?</i>

710
00:50:12,034 --> 00:50:14,025
Which one of you is Cole?

711
00:50:25,481 --> 00:50:28,109
- You're Cole?
- You that dude from the contest?

712
00:50:28,183 --> 00:50:30,617
A contest I'd like to see you win.

713
00:50:30,686 --> 00:50:34,782
- Don't worry.
- But I am worried, Cole.

714
00:50:35,991 --> 00:50:38,960
I'm worried that four
fat, dumb dance 'tards...

715
00:50:39,028 --> 00:50:41,496
are gonna stir up a bunch of goodwill
and nostalgia...

716
00:50:41,563 --> 00:50:45,499
and get their wack wrinkly asses
on my network for a year.

717
00:50:46,935 --> 00:50:48,903
I can't let that happen.

718
00:50:50,172 --> 00:50:52,902
That's where you four come in.

719
00:50:52,975 --> 00:50:58,003
Now listen to me very carefully,
and I will make sure you get rich, famous...

720
00:50:58,080 --> 00:51:00,742
and most important of all...

721
00:51:00,816 --> 00:51:03,307
that you beat the Funky Fresh Boyz.

722
00:51:03,385 --> 00:51:05,410
No problem.

723
00:51:05,487 --> 00:51:08,149
Only we'll do more
than just beat them.

724
00:51:08,223 --> 00:51:11,624
We'll make sure
that they get served.

725
00:51:15,264 --> 00:51:18,324
Yeah. I don't think that sounds
as manly as you think it does.

726
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:21,767
- Yeah, huh.
- How old am I again?

727
00:51:25,674 --> 00:51:27,699
All right.
Let's take it from the top.

728
00:51:32,214 --> 00:51:34,842
Excuse me one second, girls.

729
00:52:16,325 --> 00:52:18,088
<i>Yes.</i>

730
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:20,560
<i>Yes.</i>

731
00:52:22,764 --> 00:52:23,992
<i>Uh-oh.</i>

732
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:35,137
- Hi, Justin.
- Oh, hey.

733
00:52:35,210 --> 00:52:37,440
Hi. Yo.

734
00:52:37,513 --> 00:52:40,846
Uh- I-D-Do you work right here?

735
00:52:40,916 --> 00:52:43,407
I'd love to go to dinner with you.

736
00:52:43,485 --> 00:52:46,852
But right now I have to
teach my dance class, okay?

737
00:52:48,957 --> 00:52:52,120
- And, Darnell-
- <i>He's not in here.</i>

738
00:52:52,194 --> 00:52:55,425
- You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
- <i>Y-You look nice.</i>

739
00:52:59,868 --> 00:53:03,702
Darnell? You're here?

740
00:53:51,386 --> 00:53:53,479
Bye.

741
00:53:56,024 --> 00:53:58,492
Yes!

742
00:53:58,627 --> 00:54:00,492
You pretend to be Jen.

743
00:54:00,562 --> 00:54:02,996
I don't know why
you're making me be the girl.

744
00:54:03,065 --> 00:54:05,431
Because there's more of you
to love, Hector.

745
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:07,434
Now here, put this on.

746
00:54:09,605 --> 00:54:13,837
Justin, you just rang the doorbell.

747
00:54:13,909 --> 00:54:16,639
Make your move.

748
00:54:16,712 --> 00:54:18,942
- Hi, Justin.
- <i>Hi.</i>

749
00:54:19,014 --> 00:54:22,177
- Justin, how do I look?
- Uh-

750
00:54:22,251 --> 00:54:24,515
Justin, do I look nice?

751
00:54:24,586 --> 00:54:27,020
Do you think that maybe I look nice?

752
00:54:29,191 --> 00:54:32,126
You gotta make me feel pretty.
You gotta make me feel like a woman.

753
00:54:32,194 --> 00:54:34,458
You know what
I'm telling you, huh, Justin?

754
00:54:34,529 --> 00:54:37,965
You think I'm stupid?
I ain't stupid.

755
00:54:38,033 --> 00:54:41,002
<i>You don't tell me nothing.</i>
<i>You don't take me out.</i>

756
00:54:41,069 --> 00:54:43,060
You think I'm a whore?
I am no whore!

757
00:54:43,138 --> 00:54:45,971
- <i>I-</i>
- You like that? Huh?

758
00:54:46,041 --> 00:54:48,373
Do you? What's my name?
Say my name.

759
00:54:48,443 --> 00:54:51,139
- Who's your father?
- De-de-de-de-de!

760
00:54:51,213 --> 00:54:54,080
- Oh! Oh, oh!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! What are you doin'?

761
00:54:54,149 --> 00:54:56,083
That's what adults do
on the Internet.

762
00:54:56,151 --> 00:54:58,142
They get naked and ask each other
their names, right?

763
00:54:58,220 --> 00:55:01,087
- Shave!
- Come on, man.

764
00:55:01,156 --> 00:55:03,818
This is clearly not workin'.

765
00:55:03,892 --> 00:55:07,191
Okay, what we need to do is,
we need to move to phase two.

766
00:55:13,935 --> 00:55:17,132
What? It's muscle.

767
00:55:17,205 --> 00:55:19,765
Just not toned.

768
00:55:19,841 --> 00:55:21,775
Okay. All right.

769
00:55:21,843 --> 00:55:23,834
Now, Justin, here's what
I need you to do.

770
00:55:23,912 --> 00:55:26,039
You see that?

771
00:55:26,114 --> 00:55:29,140
I need you to slowly-

772
00:55:29,217 --> 00:55:32,516
slowly make your move
for the breasteses.

773
00:55:32,587 --> 00:55:34,953
- You get it. Do it.
- <i>There you go. Now come on.</i>

774
00:55:35,023 --> 00:55:36,513
- <i>That's it.</i>
- Yeah.

775
00:55:36,591 --> 00:55:39,685
- Yeah. Now go slow. Slow.
- Slow, slow, slow, slow.

776
00:55:39,761 --> 00:55:41,888
- You don't want to hurt her.
- Like this?

777
00:55:41,963 --> 00:55:44,454
<i>No, no, no, no.</i>
<i>Why you got the hand turned? No, no.</i>

778
00:55:44,533 --> 00:55:46,933
Straight up like that.
Exert your manliness.

779
00:55:47,002 --> 00:55:49,527
- You just squeeze it.
- Wh-Wh-What are you showing him?

780
00:55:49,604 --> 00:55:52,038
You have to play it
like a soft, little...

781
00:55:52,107 --> 00:55:54,803
tiny violin.

782
00:55:57,212 --> 00:55:59,146
Ow!
Knock that off.

783
00:55:59,214 --> 00:56:02,149
Yeah! You know, it's not a twist off.
You don't just twist the thing.

784
00:56:02,217 --> 00:56:05,482
- You knead it.
- Shut up! It feels good like that for girls!

785
00:56:05,554 --> 00:56:08,580
- You don't know.
- I'm doin' the lesson here! Yeah, now work it.

786
00:56:08,657 --> 00:56:12,616
<i>Now work it on your own.</i>
<i>Yeah, there you go. Now knead. Knead.</i>

787
00:56:12,694 --> 00:56:15,128
Lean in on her.
By now she should be likin' all that.

788
00:56:15,197 --> 00:56:18,257
Lean in on her. Lean in on her.
Get in on it.

789
00:56:18,333 --> 00:56:21,496
<i>Now blow on 'em. Blow on 'em.</i>
<i>That's it. Now, work it. Work it.</i>

790
00:56:21,570 --> 00:56:23,663
- <i>Yeah, work it. And lick your lips.</i>
- Yeah.

791
00:56:23,739 --> 00:56:25,900
<i>You're a monster.</i>
<i>That's it.</i>

792
00:56:25,974 --> 00:56:27,908
- Come on now. Make your move.
- Stop it! Ow!

793
00:56:27,976 --> 00:56:29,841
- Dude. All right!
- Justin, move on in.

794
00:56:31,513 --> 00:56:33,504
Stop!
I'm a man!

795
00:56:33,582 --> 00:56:37,450
I am a man, all right?
This is a man. I'm not a woman.

796
00:56:37,519 --> 00:56:40,488
- All right.
- I'm sorry.

797
00:56:41,556 --> 00:56:43,956
How was that?
Did I pass?

798
00:56:44,025 --> 00:56:46,459
Oh, you're like
a sexual machine animal.

799
00:56:46,528 --> 00:56:48,621
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You were good.

800
00:56:48,697 --> 00:56:50,995
<i>You were kneadin'-</i>
<i>I was feelin' it. I was feelin' it.</i>

801
00:56:51,066 --> 00:56:52,829
Justin!
All right.

802
00:56:52,901 --> 00:56:55,836
Okay, now go take a shower.
Take a shower now. Take a shower.

803
00:56:55,904 --> 00:56:58,702
<i>Smoke 'em if you got 'em.</i>

804
00:56:58,774 --> 00:57:01,470
Damn. He's never gonna get laid.

805
00:57:01,543 --> 00:57:04,842
- He gonna die a virgin.
- Ever- Die.

806
00:57:04,913 --> 00:57:08,405
My man just needs a little something
to get him through the night, you know?

807
00:57:08,483 --> 00:57:10,474
Put him in the zone.

808
00:57:10,552 --> 00:57:14,318
If only there was something really awesome
we could get for him to say or maybe wear.

809
00:57:15,490 --> 00:57:17,424
Or drive.

810
00:57:22,831 --> 00:57:26,358
- So where are we goin'?
- My ride should be here any minute.

811
00:57:47,322 --> 00:57:51,258
Justin.
Oh, you must be Jen.

812
00:57:51,326 --> 00:57:53,760
Uh-
And you're-

813
00:57:53,829 --> 00:57:57,094
A young loner on a crusade to champion
the cause of the innocent...

814
00:57:57,165 --> 00:57:59,292
the powerless, the helpless...

815
00:57:59,367 --> 00:58:02,063
in a world of criminals
who operate above the law.

816
00:58:02,137 --> 00:58:05,106
- Whoa.
- Right.

817
00:58:05,173 --> 00:58:08,404
<i>Well, you two, he's all yours.</i>

818
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:14,742
<i>Justin, remember...</i>

819
00:58:14,816 --> 00:58:16,909
91 octane or above.

820
00:58:16,985 --> 00:58:20,352
He's getting a little old.

821
00:58:20,422 --> 00:58:22,356
Oh, and, Justin...

822
00:58:22,424 --> 00:58:25,587
like a little violin.

823
00:58:25,660 --> 00:58:28,254
Thanks, David Hasselhoff.

824
00:58:39,841 --> 00:58:42,503
Looks like they forgot my burger.

825
00:58:42,577 --> 00:58:44,670
Oh, that's too bad.

826
00:58:44,746 --> 00:58:47,476
Robble, robble.

827
00:58:47,549 --> 00:58:49,483
I'm sorry.
Can you say that again?

828
00:58:49,551 --> 00:58:53,043
I said, that's too bad
they forgot your hamburger.

829
00:58:53,121 --> 00:58:55,316
Stinks, you know.
You must be hungry.

830
00:58:55,390 --> 00:58:57,324
Robble, robble, robble.

831
00:59:01,663 --> 00:59:03,597
Robble, robble, robble.

832
00:59:03,665 --> 00:59:05,599
Give it back!
That's mine.

833
00:59:05,667 --> 00:59:08,727
Hey, give me back my burg-

834
00:59:08,803 --> 00:59:10,737
Robble, robble, robble, robble.

835
00:59:10,805 --> 00:59:13,239
- Ro- Ro- Robble.
- Hey! Gimme.

836
00:59:15,210 --> 00:59:18,646
Why are you marrying Kip?

837
00:59:18,713 --> 00:59:22,444
Excuse me while I go
look at that thing over there.

838
00:59:24,185 --> 00:59:26,244
He's a total homo-

839
00:59:26,321 --> 00:59:28,983
jerk-wad.

840
00:59:29,057 --> 00:59:31,116
He doesn't care
about what you want...

841
00:59:31,192 --> 00:59:35,151
he's mean and he- he dresses like someone
Crockett and Tubbs should shoot.

842
00:59:38,833 --> 00:59:41,495
Kip's not so bad.

843
00:59:41,570 --> 00:59:46,303
We lost touch for a while and met up
after college. And, you know-

844
00:59:46,374 --> 00:59:49,434
I missed everything.

845
00:59:49,511 --> 00:59:51,574
- Don't say that.
- It's true.

846
00:59:51,707 --> 00:59:55,040
<i>Gremlins 2, Ghostbusters II.</i>

847
00:59:55,110 --> 00:59:57,772
I just found out they made jeans
washed in acid...

848
00:59:57,846 --> 00:59:59,814
which is awesome.

849
00:59:59,882 --> 01:00:02,476
But I missed that too.

850
01:00:02,551 --> 01:00:05,349
Stupid coma.

851
01:00:05,421 --> 01:00:09,187
It's not all bad.
You missed out on pimples...

852
01:00:09,258 --> 01:00:13,388
hair-metal power ballads, prom.

853
01:00:13,462 --> 01:00:16,898
- Bleh.
- No, I bet prom was nice.

854
01:00:16,966 --> 01:00:21,630
No. They make it sound all nice
with rainbows and unicorns.

855
01:00:22,938 --> 01:00:25,133
They forget to tell you
you're gonna get your period...

856
01:00:25,207 --> 01:00:27,141
in your white dress.

857
01:00:28,210 --> 01:00:30,201
I wish I could have
taken you to the prom.

858
01:00:31,580 --> 01:00:33,605
I would have bought you
one of those flower things...

859
01:00:33,682 --> 01:00:36,549
for your wrist that matched
the color of your period.

860
01:00:39,154 --> 01:00:42,214
And then the deejay would have played
El DeBarge, and we could have slow danced.

861
01:00:50,399 --> 01:00:52,333
Sounds like here's your chance.

862
01:00:58,874 --> 01:01:01,365
You know, now that
you're taller than the girls...

863
01:01:01,443 --> 01:01:04,241
your hands go here.

864
01:01:41,850 --> 01:01:43,613
Justin, we can't.

865
01:01:43,686 --> 01:01:46,917
Wait.
I almost forgot.

866
01:01:59,068 --> 01:02:01,559
I can't believe you kept this.

867
01:02:01,637 --> 01:02:04,470
I was in a coma.
Made it kinda hard to throw out.

868
01:02:06,542 --> 01:02:08,476
But I would have never
thrown this out.

869
01:02:08,544 --> 01:02:12,002
This is the most important toy
I've ever owned in my whole life.

870
01:02:28,697 --> 01:02:31,461
It's a good thing David
had my seats Scotchgarded.

871
01:02:33,869 --> 01:02:35,700
<i>Justin, could you please not-</i>

872
01:02:56,391 --> 01:02:58,325
I'll never...

873
01:02:58,393 --> 01:03:00,327
play video games again.

874
01:03:20,549 --> 01:03:22,574
Let me just shut that off.

875
01:03:25,420 --> 01:03:27,820
Oh, my God.
It's Kip.

876
01:03:27,890 --> 01:03:29,824
Oh, my God.
What am I doing?

877
01:03:29,892 --> 01:03:32,326
Oh, my God. I'm engaged.
What am I doing?

878
01:03:32,394 --> 01:03:34,225
Seriously, what am I doing?
Oh, my God.

879
01:03:34,296 --> 01:03:36,856
Oh, my God.
Justin, I'm so sorry.

880
01:03:36,932 --> 01:03:39,059
Justin, I'm so sorry.

881
01:03:39,134 --> 01:03:42,001
- I'm sorry, Justin!
- Why are you sorry?

882
01:03:42,070 --> 01:03:44,231
- <i>Kip!</i>
- That was awesome.

883
01:03:46,375 --> 01:03:48,741
<i>Justin. Justin!</i>

884
01:03:54,616 --> 01:03:56,675
Justin. Justin! Relax.

885
01:03:56,752 --> 01:03:58,777
- Tell me now. What happened?
- Okay.

886
01:03:58,854 --> 01:04:01,880
We kissed on the face.
And then she opened up her shirt.

887
01:04:01,957 --> 01:04:04,858
And then she- she-
I touched her left booby.

888
01:04:04,927 --> 01:04:07,487
And then she cried and ran away.

889
01:04:07,563 --> 01:04:09,497
What base is that?

890
01:04:09,565 --> 01:04:12,591
Nigga, that ain't a base.
That's a crime.

891
01:04:12,668 --> 01:04:16,001
- Justin, you just can't-
- Party!

892
01:04:21,643 --> 01:04:23,577
Hey, Jen!

893
01:04:23,645 --> 01:04:26,978
Aki, Hector.
Great to see you guys.

894
01:04:27,049 --> 01:04:31,748
Wow. You two are like a bad buddy cop movie
waiting to happen.

895
01:04:33,455 --> 01:04:36,549
<i>What are you, Detective Rice</i>
<i>and Detective Beans?</i>

896
01:04:40,362 --> 01:04:42,592
Could you guys give this
to Justin for me?

897
01:04:44,366 --> 01:04:46,061
We're not stayin'?

898
01:04:46,134 --> 01:04:48,967
<i>Justin will be back in a second.</i>
<i>He just went to the bathroom.</i>

899
01:04:49,037 --> 01:04:52,666
Yeah!
Oh, Jen!

900
01:04:55,510 --> 01:04:57,978
Hey, Jen!

901
01:04:58,046 --> 01:05:00,674
Hey, Jen! Hey.

902
01:05:00,749 --> 01:05:02,683
Isn't this place cool?

903
01:05:02,751 --> 01:05:05,777
Hey. Oh, I won this
playing Skee-Ball.

904
01:05:07,589 --> 01:05:10,057
Hmm. Garfield.
That's sweet.

905
01:05:10,125 --> 01:05:13,026
Yeah. Twenty-one tickets.
No big whoop.

906
01:05:13,095 --> 01:05:15,495
Let's play Whaca Taco.
Come on.

907
01:05:16,732 --> 01:05:18,757
Oh! Oh!

908
01:05:18,834 --> 01:05:20,358
Sorry.

909
01:05:22,671 --> 01:05:25,868
Hey. Number nine.

910
01:05:27,042 --> 01:05:28,976
Is that number 10...

911
01:05:29,044 --> 01:05:32,013
for ya, fatty?

912
01:05:35,684 --> 01:05:37,982
- Justin, we need to talk.
- Okay.

913
01:05:38,053 --> 01:05:40,180
But you gotta talk
and whack at the same time.

914
01:05:42,791 --> 01:05:45,385
I wanted to buy you something
that you could wear...

915
01:05:45,460 --> 01:05:47,394
since we're both going steady.

916
01:05:47,462 --> 01:05:51,592
- But since I didn't get my allowance this week-
- Justin, we're not going steady.

917
01:05:58,307 --> 01:06:01,765
But last night.

918
01:06:03,412 --> 01:06:07,041
<i>Last night was a mistake.</i>

919
01:06:08,750 --> 01:06:10,581
I'm with Kip.

920
01:06:12,321 --> 01:06:14,255
We're getting married.

921
01:06:14,323 --> 01:06:18,054
We have stability,
we're talking about starting a family.

922
01:06:18,126 --> 01:06:21,994
I can't just give up on that because of
what we had 20 years ago.

923
01:06:22,064 --> 01:06:24,498
I don't get it.

924
01:06:24,566 --> 01:06:26,659
I don't expect you to get it.

925
01:06:26,735 --> 01:06:28,669
It's complicated.

926
01:06:30,939 --> 01:06:33,169
You're still just a kid.

927
01:06:41,583 --> 01:06:44,017
May I see the Garfield eraser
for a second, please?

928
01:07:03,138 --> 01:07:05,766
Calm down.
Stop it!

929
01:07:09,544 --> 01:07:11,205
Try not to hate me.

930
01:07:11,279 --> 01:07:14,442
I hate you more
than Garfield hates Mondays.

931
01:07:14,516 --> 01:07:17,041
I thought Garfield hated lasagna.

932
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:19,314
Garfield loves lasagna!

933
01:07:20,922 --> 01:07:22,981
I wish they would've
taken me off life support.

934
01:07:37,906 --> 01:07:40,568
Work it, Hector!

935
01:07:40,642 --> 01:07:43,406
<i>Work it, Hector!</i>

936
01:07:43,478 --> 01:07:45,844
Oh. Yo, man!

937
01:07:45,914 --> 01:07:49,509
<i>Oh, uh-oh. What you got?</i>
<i>What you got, Justin?</i>

938
01:07:49,584 --> 01:07:51,950
Go, Coma! Go, Coma!

939
01:07:52,020 --> 01:07:55,820
<i>Go, Coma! Go, Coma!</i>
<i>Go, Coma! Go, Coma!</i>

940
01:07:55,891 --> 01:07:58,086
You can dance in a video game...

941
01:07:58,160 --> 01:08:00,094
but can you dance on the street?

942
01:08:00,162 --> 01:08:03,689
Ooh.

943
01:08:03,765 --> 01:08:06,256
- I'm leaving.
- But you're gonna miss all the fun.

944
01:08:06,334 --> 01:08:09,167
That sounds like a challenge.

945
01:08:09,237 --> 01:08:11,171
Oh, it's definitely
a challenge, son.

946
01:08:11,239 --> 01:08:14,470
You and me in the parking lot,
mano a mano.

947
01:08:16,745 --> 01:08:19,043
You had mono?

948
01:08:19,114 --> 01:08:21,105
Well, I was in a coma.

949
01:08:22,384 --> 01:08:24,944
Justin, you don't have to do this.

950
01:08:25,020 --> 01:08:27,614
Oh, thanks for caring. Not!

951
01:08:27,689 --> 01:08:29,782
Get to steppin', Jen.

952
01:08:32,694 --> 01:08:34,628
Bye, Jen.

953
01:08:34,696 --> 01:08:36,186
Hmph!

954
01:09:33,488 --> 01:09:35,615
- What's up?
- Hey.

955
01:09:35,690 --> 01:09:37,624
Yeah, that's right.

956
01:09:47,769 --> 01:09:49,760
That's right, son.

957
01:10:01,283 --> 01:10:03,274
Hmph!

958
01:10:07,822 --> 01:10:09,847
- Ah, no, no, no!
- De-de-de-de-de!

959
01:10:09,925 --> 01:10:11,916
That's good. That's good.
You're good.

960
01:10:15,664 --> 01:10:18,132
Watch this.

961
01:10:21,670 --> 01:10:24,969
One song.
Crowd picks the winner.

962
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:28,134
A'ight?

963
01:10:29,211 --> 01:10:30,940
Say it, don't spray it.

964
01:10:37,018 --> 01:10:39,646
- Yeah, man. Yeah.
- <i>Justin! Justin!</i>

965
01:10:39,721 --> 01:10:41,655
<i>Yeah, what you got?</i>
<i>What you got?</i>

966
01:10:54,369 --> 01:10:56,166
This shrimp ain't nothin'.

967
01:10:59,074 --> 01:11:00,871
Oh, yeah. That old trick?

968
01:11:04,946 --> 01:11:08,143
He's great.
Oh, crap.

969
01:11:12,053 --> 01:11:16,513
What am I doin' here?
Mom? Dad? Yogurt? Coma?

970
01:11:19,961 --> 01:11:21,792
Wake up! Wake up!

971
01:11:28,370 --> 01:11:30,304
You just got served, son!

972
01:11:49,257 --> 01:11:52,249
Damn! What the hell
you ruin the cake for?

973
01:11:52,327 --> 01:11:55,490
I fixed it so it looks like my life.

974
01:11:55,563 --> 01:11:58,259
Like a big piece of doody.

975
01:11:58,333 --> 01:12:01,359
- Doesn't it look like doody?
- Mm-mmm.

976
01:12:01,436 --> 01:12:04,872
- We don't want to talk about no doody cake.
- My life is doody cake.

977
01:12:04,939 --> 01:12:08,875
<i>My life is like</i>
<i>one big piece of crap...</i>

978
01:12:08,943 --> 01:12:11,104
<i>that was put in</i>
<i>the freezer forever...</i>

979
01:12:11,179 --> 01:12:14,444
and then thawed out in a hurry.

980
01:12:14,516 --> 01:12:17,917
And now they're both big...

981
01:12:17,986 --> 01:12:21,717
squished soggy pieces of... shit!

982
01:12:21,790 --> 01:12:25,282
- Justin!
- Shit cake that nobody wants!

983
01:12:25,360 --> 01:12:27,294
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

984
01:12:27,362 --> 01:12:31,230
Chill, Justin!

985
01:12:31,299 --> 01:12:35,565
<i>Justin! What the hell are you doin'?</i>

986
01:12:35,637 --> 01:12:38,367
Chill, Justin! This is already
embarrassing enough.

987
01:12:38,440 --> 01:12:40,374
Yeah, your analogy
is tenuous at best.

988
01:12:43,812 --> 01:12:45,746
We're a bunch of losers.

989
01:12:45,814 --> 01:12:48,647
<i>We're a bunch of 30-year-old men...</i>

990
01:12:48,717 --> 01:12:53,086
pretending to be 13 years old
trying to win a dance contest.

991
01:12:53,154 --> 01:12:54,951
<i>Hey, guys...</i>

992
01:12:55,023 --> 01:12:58,652
that's a great way to redeem
our failed and miserable lives.

993
01:12:58,727 --> 01:13:01,821
- Let's enter a dance contest.
- This was your idea!

994
01:13:01,896 --> 01:13:04,797
I was in a coma!

995
01:13:04,866 --> 01:13:07,426
I feel like a retard.

996
01:13:07,502 --> 01:13:09,993
Uh, Justin,
it's not really P.C. to say-

997
01:13:10,071 --> 01:13:11,971
Retarded?

998
01:13:12,040 --> 01:13:15,237
Who's retarded?

999
01:13:17,545 --> 01:13:21,413
It's not nice to say "retarded."

1000
01:13:24,686 --> 01:13:26,984
Bye, Orko.

1001
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:34,494
Bye, Jokey Smurf.

1002
01:13:40,735 --> 01:13:43,033
Bye, Micro Machines made by Galoob.

1003
01:14:20,041 --> 01:14:23,841
What in the hell...

1004
01:14:23,912 --> 01:14:25,846
have we gotten ourselves into?

1005
01:14:32,120 --> 01:14:36,318
Hey. Watch where
you're goin', egg roll. A'ight?

1006
01:14:38,426 --> 01:14:40,724
What? What?

1007
01:14:40,795 --> 01:14:43,525
- Huh!
- What the-

1008
01:14:43,598 --> 01:14:45,532
What-What about them?

1009
01:14:48,169 --> 01:14:51,502
Thing's starting soon.
We gotta sign up.

1010
01:14:51,573 --> 01:14:55,065
- Justin's not coming.
- Man, we don't need that stupid white boy.

1011
01:14:55,143 --> 01:14:57,077
Who needs him?

1012
01:14:57,145 --> 01:14:59,705
Uh, guys, we do.

1013
01:14:59,781 --> 01:15:03,547
<i>Crew must have four members.</i>

1014
01:15:03,618 --> 01:15:06,052
That was fast.
Anyone want pizza?

1015
01:15:06,120 --> 01:15:09,180
Hey, man, hold on.
We're not gonna give up.

1016
01:15:09,257 --> 01:15:12,715
Look, all we need
is another break-dancer.

1017
01:15:12,794 --> 01:15:17,194
Technically, we need just one more person
who says he's a break-dancer.

1018
01:15:18,195 --> 01:15:21,062
Okay. And the fourth
Funky Fresh Boy.

1019
01:15:21,131 --> 01:15:25,090
- Name?
- Mad Slick, A.K.A. Dr. Aquafresh...

1020
01:15:25,168 --> 01:15:27,728
A.K.A. Big Jennifer Garner...

1021
01:15:27,804 --> 01:15:29,738
A.K.A. Tim Russert-

1022
01:15:29,806 --> 01:15:33,765
- Okay.
- I'm not finished!

1023
01:15:33,843 --> 01:15:37,142
A.K.A. Cream of Wheat,
A.K.A. Half an Onion Bagel...

1024
01:15:37,214 --> 01:15:41,150
A.K.A. Carl-Carl-Carl-
That's Carl with a "C," not a "K."

1025
01:15:41,218 --> 01:15:42,810
Carl-Carl-Carl!

1026
01:15:42,886 --> 01:15:45,946
Carl. Okay. Thanks.

1027
01:15:46,022 --> 01:15:49,822
Yeah, way to go.

1028
01:15:49,893 --> 01:15:53,624
Funky Fresh Boyz!

1029
01:16:01,571 --> 01:16:04,131
Yeah!

1030
01:16:04,207 --> 01:16:06,801
<i>This is</i> Get 2 Steppin'!
<i>And here's your host...</i>

1031
01:16:06,876 --> 01:16:09,344

1032
01:16:09,412 --> 01:16:11,607
Yeah!

1033
01:16:13,083 --> 01:16:15,677
<i>Come on, people!</i>
<i>Yeah!</i>

1034
01:16:15,752 --> 01:16:18,619
Kip! Kip! Kip! Kip! Kip!

1035
01:16:18,688 --> 01:16:20,622

1036
01:16:20,690 --> 01:16:23,158
Kip! Kip! Kip!

1037
01:16:23,226 --> 01:16:25,319
<i>Yeah!</i>

1038
01:16:25,395 --> 01:16:28,228
You're watchin' <i>Get 2 Steppin'</i>.
I'm your host, Kip Unger.

1039
01:16:28,298 --> 01:16:31,631
- Just Kip, Kip-
- Kippin' it real!

1040
01:16:31,701 --> 01:16:34,932
Kippin' it real, you betcha.
To my left, spinnin' the stacks of wax...

1041
01:16:35,005 --> 01:16:37,200
give it up for D.J. Tanner!

1042
01:16:39,309 --> 01:16:42,142
All day, baby.

1043
01:16:46,616 --> 01:16:49,517
Today, the best dance crews
in the world...

1044
01:16:49,586 --> 01:16:51,884
will compete on this stage
head-to-head.

1045
01:16:51,955 --> 01:16:55,015
When they're done,
you all get the final word.

1046
01:16:55,091 --> 01:16:58,492
- So, if you like somethin', make some noise.
- Yeah!

1047
01:17:00,430 --> 01:17:03,797
All right, let's hit off our first battle
with two randomly selected crews.

1048
01:17:03,867 --> 01:17:09,533
Iced Cole Krew versus the Misfitz.
Give it up!

1049
01:17:11,074 --> 01:17:13,304
Are you ready?

1050
01:17:14,644 --> 01:17:17,477
Misfitz!
Iced Cole Krew!

1051
01:17:17,547 --> 01:17:21,643
Get to steppin'!
Yeah!

1052
01:17:22,986 --> 01:17:27,753
One, two, three, you're up!

1053
01:18:42,799 --> 01:18:44,926
I think we're out
of our league here.

1054
01:18:45,001 --> 01:18:48,129
Come on, man. Don't talk like that.
We can do this.

1055
01:19:03,553 --> 01:19:05,350
Let's hear it, y'all!

1056
01:19:09,793 --> 01:19:13,194
Get to steppin'.
Get to steppin'.

1057
01:19:13,263 --> 01:19:15,197
All right.
Next up...

1058
01:19:15,265 --> 01:19:20,134
give it up for Wack Attack
versus the Funky Fresh Boyz.

1059
01:19:20,203 --> 01:19:24,162
Okay! Yeah!
Funky Fresh Boyz. Wack Attack.

1060
01:19:24,240 --> 01:19:26,174
Get to steppin'!

1061
01:19:26,242 --> 01:19:31,202
Are you ready, Funky Fresh Boyz?

1062
01:19:57,540 --> 01:19:59,064
What's up? Bring it.
Bring it.

1063
01:20:22,465 --> 01:20:24,899
Yeah!

1064
01:20:24,968 --> 01:20:27,664
You're goin' down'! You're goin' down, low fry.

1065
01:20:39,082 --> 01:20:41,414
Ew!

1066
01:20:41,484 --> 01:20:42,712
Ew!

1067
01:20:44,120 --> 01:20:46,145
Get to steppin'!

1068
01:20:46,222 --> 01:20:49,419
Get to steppin'!
Get to steppin'!

1069
01:20:49,492 --> 01:20:51,392
- <i>Hey, sweetie!</i>
- <i>Yeah?</i>

1070
01:20:51,461 --> 01:20:53,725
- You suck!
- Whoa, what just happened?

1071
01:20:53,796 --> 01:20:57,562
Yeah! I don't know.
I told you guys we could do this.

1072
01:20:59,269 --> 01:21:03,069
- Throw your hands up. Throw your hands up.
- <i>They like us!</i>

1073
01:21:04,908 --> 01:21:06,773
Get to steppin'!

1074
01:21:23,793 --> 01:21:26,091
Get to steppin'!

1075
01:21:34,370 --> 01:21:36,736
Get to steppin'!

1076
01:21:52,422 --> 01:21:55,323
Ah, check me out.

1077
01:22:01,898 --> 01:22:04,196
Wow!

1078
01:22:05,768 --> 01:22:08,100
All right.
That was great.

1079
01:22:08,171 --> 01:22:11,072
Next up, Iced Cole Krew
versus Pink Sushi.

1080
01:22:15,044 --> 01:22:16,341
Whoo!

1081
01:23:22,345 --> 01:23:24,836
<i>Yeah!</i>

1082
01:23:28,985 --> 01:23:30,976
Oh!

1083
01:23:32,121 --> 01:23:35,249
All right. Next up,
the Funky Fresh Boyz...

1084
01:23:35,324 --> 01:23:37,258
against the Krump Kings.

1085
01:23:39,195 --> 01:23:42,028
Funky Fresh Boyz.
Krump Kings.

1086
01:23:42,098 --> 01:23:44,032
Get to steppin'!

1087
01:23:44,100 --> 01:23:46,534
Yeah!

1088
01:24:14,664 --> 01:24:16,928
Whoo!

1089
01:24:46,229 --> 01:24:48,663
- You suck!
- What?

1090
01:24:57,774 --> 01:25:00,766
Hey, they got medication for that now.

1091
01:25:16,959 --> 01:25:20,190
Yeah! That's right!

1092
01:25:20,263 --> 01:25:24,199
<i>We got some. We got some.</i>
<i>We got some moves.</i>

1093
01:25:24,267 --> 01:25:26,326
<i>Whoa!</i>

1094
01:25:39,015 --> 01:25:40,949
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1095
01:25:46,122 --> 01:25:48,716
- So, what do you think, boss?
- What I always think.

1096
01:25:48,791 --> 01:25:51,282
It'll be a huge hit
or a massive flop.

1097
01:25:51,360 --> 01:25:53,590
How about a huge,
massive, floppy hit?

1098
01:25:53,663 --> 01:25:57,724
- What the hell does that mean?
- I don't know.

1099
01:25:57,800 --> 01:26:00,325
How did Cole's crew
know to show up at Justin's party?

1100
01:26:00,403 --> 01:26:03,031
Shh.

1101
01:26:04,440 --> 01:26:07,102
- God!
- Why'd you do it, Kip?

1102
01:26:07,176 --> 01:26:09,110
Why'd I do it?

1103
01:26:09,178 --> 01:26:11,510
Because I'm not about to
let some man-child in plastic pants...

1104
01:26:11,581 --> 01:26:13,071
ruin what I've worked so hard for.

1105
01:26:13,149 --> 01:26:16,550
- At least that man-child knows who he is.
- Oh, okay.

1106
01:26:16,619 --> 01:26:20,055
So, what, you two are gonna run off to magical
cupcake land and live happily ever after?

1107
01:26:20,122 --> 01:26:22,056
On what, your teaching salary?

1108
01:26:22,124 --> 01:26:25,787
His- His winnings from dance contests?
Grow up.

1109
01:26:28,364 --> 01:26:31,925
What are you doin' to me, girl?

1110
01:26:32,001 --> 01:26:35,266
Look, when times get tough...

1111
01:26:35,338 --> 01:26:37,272
you just gotta look at your hand...

1112
01:26:37,340 --> 01:26:40,776
see how nice this ring is...

1113
01:26:40,843 --> 01:26:43,641
and remember what you stand to lose
if you lose me.

1114
01:26:43,713 --> 01:26:46,147
What <i>I</i> stand to lose?

1115
01:26:46,215 --> 01:26:50,242
- Gag me with a big ego and a little di-
- Don't... go there.

1116
01:26:51,420 --> 01:26:53,615
You're a jerk-wad.

1117
01:26:53,689 --> 01:26:57,420
Yeah, well, have fun babysitting.

1118
01:26:57,493 --> 01:27:00,257
You know, Justin might be
a little kid, Kip...

1119
01:27:00,329 --> 01:27:03,230
but he's got more balls
than you'll ever have.

1120
01:27:03,299 --> 01:27:05,665
What, like three?

1121
01:27:05,735 --> 01:27:08,966
<i>Kip, bust a move.</i>

1122
01:27:19,682 --> 01:27:21,650
Oh, hell no.

1123
01:27:21,717 --> 01:27:24,311
You and your boyfriend
can take that good bitch, bad bitch routine...

1124
01:27:24,387 --> 01:27:26,321
and stick it right up your snutzy.

1125
01:27:26,389 --> 01:27:29,688
- Snutzy?
- Okay.

1126
01:27:29,759 --> 01:27:31,693
Terrified to ask what my snutzy is.

1127
01:27:31,761 --> 01:27:33,626
I'll tell ya.

1128
01:27:33,696 --> 01:27:36,062
And he's not my boyfriend.

1129
01:27:36,132 --> 01:27:38,965
He's probably gonna have security
drag me out of the building in 10 seconds.

1130
01:27:47,343 --> 01:27:49,277
What do you guys need?

1131
01:27:49,345 --> 01:27:52,974
It's not what.
It's who.

1132
01:28:01,791 --> 01:28:04,783
- Why are you smashing Legos?
- These are a lie.

1133
01:28:06,062 --> 01:28:08,155
They teach you
that life's all fun...

1134
01:28:08,230 --> 01:28:10,425
and you can make anything you want.

1135
01:28:10,499 --> 01:28:12,797
But you can't really
make anything you want.

1136
01:28:14,737 --> 01:28:18,070
You just get old, boring and fat.

1137
01:28:23,179 --> 01:28:25,170
How did you find me?

1138
01:28:28,050 --> 01:28:30,883
It's the only bar in town with a B.M.X. bike
parked in front.

1139
01:28:33,255 --> 01:28:37,419
Justin, I'm sorry I ran out
the other day.

1140
01:28:37,493 --> 01:28:39,688
I'm sorry it's because of Kip.

1141
01:28:39,762 --> 01:28:41,889
But if you let
the Funky Fresh Boyz down-

1142
01:28:41,964 --> 01:28:44,558
I let 'em down
by draggin' 'em into this!

1143
01:28:44,633 --> 01:28:47,761
Winning a break-dancing contest
is a stupid kid's dream!

1144
01:28:47,837 --> 01:28:51,898
You have to work to make money,
the way adults do.

1145
01:28:51,974 --> 01:28:54,670
Like, in an office.

1146
01:28:54,744 --> 01:28:57,474
Like, doin' office things.

1147
01:28:57,546 --> 01:28:59,514
Like, making copies...

1148
01:28:59,582 --> 01:29:02,244
and... not of your butt.

1149
01:29:02,318 --> 01:29:04,582
Justin...

1150
01:29:04,653 --> 01:29:07,816
maybe it is a kid's dream.

1151
01:29:07,890 --> 01:29:11,792
But I love you because you're a kid.

1152
01:29:11,861 --> 01:29:16,730
Everyone I know only cares about
trying to show how adult they are.

1153
01:29:16,799 --> 01:29:20,132
Except for you.

1154
01:29:21,270 --> 01:29:24,706
And that's the most
beautiful part about you.

1155
01:29:27,676 --> 01:29:29,610
And your friends...

1156
01:29:29,678 --> 01:29:33,114
the ones who never give up on you...

1157
01:29:33,182 --> 01:29:34,945
they need you.

1158
01:29:39,155 --> 01:29:41,316
Almost as much as I do.

1159
01:29:42,525 --> 01:29:44,459
You want another one of these?

1160
01:29:44,527 --> 01:29:46,927
Can I have a Shirley Temple?

1161
01:29:53,736 --> 01:29:57,001
To go.

1162
01:29:59,575 --> 01:30:02,635
- It's the final battle.
- Yeah!

1163
01:30:09,885 --> 01:30:11,819
And here it goes.

1164
01:30:11,887 --> 01:30:14,617
Iced Cole Krew...

1165
01:30:14,690 --> 01:30:17,318
versus- and I don't know how
they're still here-

1166
01:30:17,393 --> 01:30:21,762
- but the Funky Fresh Boyz.
- Yeah!

1167
01:30:21,831 --> 01:30:23,958
All right! Let's go!

1168
01:30:31,607 --> 01:30:34,098
Well, if it isn't Larry, Curly and Homo.

1169
01:30:36,278 --> 01:30:40,408
The final battle begins
in three, two-

1170
01:30:40,483 --> 01:30:43,884
<i>Wait!</i>

1171
01:30:43,953 --> 01:30:46,217
Wait!

1172
01:30:46,288 --> 01:30:48,483
- Justin.
- Justin.

1173
01:30:48,557 --> 01:30:51,822
Well, look what the '80s
dragged in, folks.

1174
01:30:51,894 --> 01:30:54,294
Kip, hold up. Um, we're gonna need
to make a substitution.

1175
01:30:54,363 --> 01:30:57,992
Oh, sorry. Rules is rules. Uh, you gotta dance
with the ones you brought.

1176
01:30:58,067 --> 01:31:01,728
- Let him dance!
- Shut up, Jen.

1177
01:31:01,803 --> 01:31:03,737
Yeah! Let him dance!
Let him dance!

1178
01:31:03,805 --> 01:31:07,798
Let him dance!
Let him dance!

1179
01:31:07,875 --> 01:31:10,844
Let him dance! Let him dance!

1180
01:31:10,912 --> 01:31:13,472
Let him dance!
Let him dance!

1181
01:31:13,548 --> 01:31:16,483
Let him dance!
Let him dance!

1182
01:31:16,551 --> 01:31:18,576
- Let him dance!
- All right. Okay.

1183
01:31:18,653 --> 01:31:21,213
Let him dance!
Let him dance!

1184
01:31:21,289 --> 01:31:24,224
Okay. All right.
All right. All right!

1185
01:31:24,292 --> 01:31:27,728
All right!
All right!

1186
01:31:27,795 --> 01:31:30,320
All right. Awesome.

1187
01:31:30,398 --> 01:31:32,992
But it's actually up to Cole.

1188
01:31:33,067 --> 01:31:34,534
Cole.

1189
01:31:34,602 --> 01:31:36,263
What's up, Chicken Little?

1190
01:31:38,740 --> 01:31:40,674
All right.
Don't worry. I got this.

1191
01:31:40,742 --> 01:31:42,676
We can't risk it.

1192
01:31:42,744 --> 01:31:44,678
Just trust me, all right?

1193
01:31:48,316 --> 01:31:51,547
Let him dance, yo.

1194
01:31:51,619 --> 01:31:53,553
Go show 'em, Justin.

1195
01:31:53,621 --> 01:31:56,215
Yes.

1196
01:32:05,166 --> 01:32:07,828
Yeah! Yeah!

1197
01:32:07,902 --> 01:32:09,927
Yeah!

1198
01:32:10,004 --> 01:32:12,768
I knew you were gonna make it!
I knew you'd make it!

1199
01:32:12,840 --> 01:32:14,774
Come here!
Come on!

1200
01:32:16,711 --> 01:32:19,271
Huddle up, guys.
When we were kids...

1201
01:32:19,347 --> 01:32:22,282
rap was all about food
and girls and fun stuff.

1202
01:32:22,350 --> 01:32:25,319
Now times have changed.
Now rap is all about...

1203
01:32:25,386 --> 01:32:30,050
- puttin' wheels on your cars and slappin' women.
- Yeah.

1204
01:32:30,124 --> 01:32:32,820
But this stuff can still be fun.

1205
01:32:32,894 --> 01:32:36,421
So, let's-
let's just have fun out there.

1206
01:32:36,497 --> 01:32:38,727
Okay, I got one thing to say.

1207
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:43,328
Daniel-san,
karate here, karate here-

1208
01:32:43,404 --> 01:32:45,770
- karate never here.
- No, karate's not there.

1209
01:32:45,840 --> 01:32:49,207
- I'm sorry. I was aiming for your belt.
- That's not karate. That's weird.

1210
01:32:49,277 --> 01:32:53,509
Ancient crane technique-
if do right, no can defend.

1211
01:32:53,581 --> 01:32:55,674
Ay!

1212
01:32:57,318 --> 01:33:00,549
- What the hell does that mean?
- Guys, come on.

1213
01:33:00,621 --> 01:33:04,489
This is the first step
on the road to becoming...

1214
01:33:04,559 --> 01:33:07,653
whatever the hell we want.

1215
01:33:07,729 --> 01:33:10,459
- Homeboys forever.
- Homeboys forever.

1216
01:33:10,531 --> 01:33:13,159
- Homeboys forever.
- Homeboys forever.

1217
01:33:13,234 --> 01:33:16,032
Funky Fresh Boyz! F.F.B.!

1218
01:33:16,104 --> 01:33:17,366
Yeah!

1219
01:33:17,438 --> 01:33:20,566
<i>Iced Cole Krew, get to steppin'!</i>

1220
01:33:20,641 --> 01:33:23,109
Mom, how'd you find me?

1221
01:33:23,177 --> 01:33:25,111
But they need me.

1222
01:33:25,179 --> 01:33:28,171
Justin, come on!

1223
01:33:33,788 --> 01:33:35,779
- Mom, this is important!
- Justin...

1224
01:33:35,857 --> 01:33:38,587
this break-dancing thing has caused
this family nothing but heartache.

1225
01:33:38,659 --> 01:33:40,627
It's time to grow up, Son.

1226
01:33:40,695 --> 01:33:43,687
You want me to be a grown-up
and stop break-dancing?

1227
01:33:43,765 --> 01:33:46,632
That's fine.
I respect that.

1228
01:33:46,701 --> 01:33:50,467
- But being a grown-up means
making your own decisions.
- Hey, come on! Justin!

1229
01:33:50,538 --> 01:33:54,736
The world don't move
to the beat of just one drum.

1230
01:33:56,010 --> 01:33:59,673
What might be right for you
may not be right for some.

1231
01:33:59,747 --> 01:34:04,343
- Justin! Come on, man!
- Everybody's got a way to shine.

1232
01:34:04,418 --> 01:34:07,216
They'll have theirs...

1233
01:34:07,288 --> 01:34:09,882
you'll have yours...

1234
01:34:09,957 --> 01:34:12,391
and I'll have mine.

1235
01:34:12,460 --> 01:34:15,725
And together we'll be fine.

1236
01:34:17,465 --> 01:34:19,399
It takes different strokes.

1237
01:34:20,501 --> 01:34:22,969
Different strokes?

1238
01:34:23,037 --> 01:34:26,097
Different strokes to move the world.

1239
01:34:26,174 --> 01:34:28,108
You tear it up, Son.
Okay?

1240
01:34:28,176 --> 01:34:30,940
You have a good time, have fun,
and you pop a move.

1241
01:34:32,847 --> 01:34:35,338
All right.
Just-Just...

1242
01:34:35,416 --> 01:34:37,441
go show those player-haters
who's bad.

1243
01:34:37,518 --> 01:34:40,043
Thank you!

1244
01:34:40,121 --> 01:34:42,851
Let's jam!

1245
01:34:42,924 --> 01:34:45,017
Gonna bust a move.

1246
01:35:14,856 --> 01:35:16,915
Prince Def Rock!

1247
01:35:16,991 --> 01:35:19,983
- Chilly Chill.
- P-P-P-Popcorn!

1248
01:35:20,061 --> 01:35:21,926
Rocket Shoe.

1249
01:35:24,131 --> 01:35:26,565
Funky Fresh Boyz! F.F.B.!

1250
01:36:06,874 --> 01:36:09,274
Yeah.

1251
01:36:14,615 --> 01:36:17,379
Whoo!

1252
01:36:21,222 --> 01:36:24,191
Whoo!

1253
01:36:41,609 --> 01:36:43,873
Whoo!

1254
01:37:03,497 --> 01:37:05,761
Watch how it's done,
old man. Step aside.

1255
01:37:11,138 --> 01:37:14,369
I can do this.

1256
01:37:16,744 --> 01:37:18,939
Okay, well, maybe I can't.

1257
01:37:25,019 --> 01:37:28,284
I gotta do the move.

1258
01:37:28,356 --> 01:37:30,756
What you got?

1259
01:37:41,535 --> 01:37:44,095
No, not again, Justin!

1260
01:37:50,711 --> 01:37:52,804
Oh, my God! Justin!

1261
01:37:52,880 --> 01:37:54,973
Justin! No!

1262
01:38:08,229 --> 01:38:10,424
All right!

1263
01:38:18,406 --> 01:38:21,807
All right. For
a hundred thousand dollars...

1264
01:38:21,876 --> 01:38:25,972
and a one-year contract
with D-Zone Videos-

1265
01:38:26,047 --> 01:38:28,106
Iced Cole Krew!

1266
01:38:31,485 --> 01:38:33,248
They were so good.

1267
01:38:40,161 --> 01:38:42,755
Or the Funky Fresh-

1268
01:38:51,238 --> 01:38:53,468
My baby!

1269
01:38:53,541 --> 01:38:55,532
Yeah! Yeah!

1270
01:38:59,280 --> 01:39:03,046
No!

1271
01:39:04,218 --> 01:39:07,483
Funky Fart Phonies!

1272
01:39:10,791 --> 01:39:13,692
Oh, don't cry, Kip.
Whoa!

1273
01:39:14,628 --> 01:39:17,358
You all right, dude?

1274
01:39:25,773 --> 01:39:28,901
He ruins... everything!

1275
01:39:28,976 --> 01:39:30,910
What?

1276
01:39:30,978 --> 01:39:35,312
He gives the girl I like
a freakin' Garbage Pail Kid!

1277
01:39:35,382 --> 01:39:39,284
And I gotta wait 17 more years
to get in her pants!

1278
01:39:43,324 --> 01:39:45,656
This is bullshit!

1279
01:39:45,726 --> 01:39:48,024
Me and you, Justin!

1280
01:39:48,095 --> 01:39:52,930
Last dance-off.
You're gonna get served!

1281
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:54,900
Man. Look at me, man.

1282
01:40:02,676 --> 01:40:05,543
<i>Freakin' geek!</i>

1283
01:40:07,748 --> 01:40:09,682
- Kip. Kip!
- You're all sluts!

1284
01:40:09,750 --> 01:40:12,519
- Baby, calm down.
- How many of you people even know you're alive?

1285
01:40:12,652 --> 01:40:15,120
<i>Kipper.</i>

1286
01:40:15,188 --> 01:40:17,281
Hey, hey, hey.
It'll be fine.

1287
01:40:17,357 --> 01:40:20,690
His pasty white ass is not gonna be
on your network for a year.

1288
01:40:22,195 --> 01:40:25,028
Oh.

1289
01:40:25,098 --> 01:40:27,532
Thanks, Bill.

1290
01:40:27,600 --> 01:40:29,932
He's gonna be on <i>my</i> network.
You're fired.

1291
01:40:36,776 --> 01:40:38,835
You're firing me?

1292
01:40:38,912 --> 01:40:42,211
Kip? Kippin' it real?
You're firing me?

1293
01:40:42,282 --> 01:40:44,807
What, are you freakin' retarded?

1294
01:40:44,884 --> 01:40:47,648
<i>It's not nice to say retarded.</i>

1295
01:40:49,722 --> 01:40:53,089
Hee-hee.

1296
01:40:56,729 --> 01:40:59,323
Did we win?

1297
01:40:59,399 --> 01:41:03,096
The worms in my brain say we win.

1298
01:41:05,171 --> 01:41:10,074
Get down with my bad-

1299
01:41:10,143 --> 01:41:12,270
Oh! Keep it real, Kip!

1300
01:41:18,718 --> 01:41:20,583
Girls.

1301
01:41:24,090 --> 01:41:26,991
<i>We did it, baby! We did it!</i>
<i>Here we go. Here we go.</i>

1302
01:41:27,060 --> 01:41:29,995
- Yeah, yeah, show me the money!
Show me the money!
- Thank you.

1303
01:41:30,063 --> 01:41:32,054
Yeah!

1304
01:41:34,601 --> 01:41:38,662
Yeah!
