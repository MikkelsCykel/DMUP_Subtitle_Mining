- Nope.

He says, whatever's going on with you,
he's sure you're going to work it out.

How was your 72-hour meditation?

7
00:00:32,598 --> 00:00:34,088
Pretty enlightening.

Yeah, I'm proud to say
I'm completely rehabilitated.

Very interesting resume, Charlie.

10
00:00:40,939 --> 00:00:43,169
Is there a private school
you haven't been kicked out of?

11
00:00:43,242 --> 00:00:46,643
- Why? You checking up on me?
- Don't flatter yourself.

Sorry.

13

Principals have access
to academic records.

14
00:00:50,516 --> 00:00:54,748
As you know, I'm the principal,
and as principal I will do my best

15
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:59,052
to help you graduate with
what you will need to survive in the world.

16
00:00:59,725 --> 00:01:02,853
But I'm not always the principal.
Sometimes I'm other things.

Oh.

20
00:01:10,869 --> 00:01:13,337
Don't worry, Charlie,
I'm not gonna call you into my office

21
00:01:13,405 --> 00:01:15,703
and have one of those intimidating
father-boyfriend talks.

22
00:01:15,774 --> 00:01:17,742
I'm not that kind of dad.

23
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:19,175
Well, thank you.

24
00:01:19,244 --> 00:01:20,404
Because if I were one of those dads,

25
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:24,575
I'd probably say how my job
is a distant second to my daughter,

26
00:01:26,151 --> 00:01:27,675
and so help me God, if you get out of line,

- Hello.
- Hello.

33
00:01:52,344 --> 00:01:57,145
So, how does this work?
Do I just talk, or... Does Murphy listen?

34
00:01:57,216 --> 00:02:00,515
Well, he's bound
by a confidentiality agreement.

35
00:02:00,586 --> 00:02:03,054
But he can leave if you want.

36
00:02:03,122 --> 00:02:06,614
- Yeah, maybe just for this first time.
- All right.

37
00:02:06,692 --> 00:02:08,523
Sorry, Murph.

38
00:02:08,594 --> 00:02:10,255
Yeah, yeah, I heard you.

39
00:02:10,329 --> 00:02:12,593
It's not like
I'm your fucking business partner.

40
00:02:12,664 --> 00:02:14,689
So, what did my dad want?

41
00:02:17,169 --> 00:02:19,160
He just wanted to welcome me back.

42
00:02:19,238 --> 00:02:22,605
He didn't say anything about me
hanging out with you?

43
00:02:23,542 --> 00:02:24,907
Not really.

44
00:02:25,811 --> 00:02:29,645
Maybe the way to do this
is to ask a question.

45
00:02:30,616 --> 00:02:32,106
What question?

46
00:02:32,584 --> 00:02:35,644
Charlie, I don't know.
You're the professional.

47
00:02:36,555 --> 00:02:40,958
All right. Well, I guess the obvious one is
how do you feel about your dad?

48
00:02:41,026 --> 00:02:44,962
You mean, besides the fact that this
stupid job turned him into an alcoholic?

49
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:46,122
Okay.

50
00:02:47,499 --> 00:02:49,592
How do you feel about that?

51
00:02:50,002 --> 00:02:53,631
I think it actually bothers him
more than me, to be honest.

52
00:02:53,705 --> 00:02:55,832
But there was the night.

53
00:02:56,875 --> 00:02:58,604
What's "the night"?

54
00:02:59,878 --> 00:03:02,779
The night he found out
my mother was having an affair.

55
00:03:02,848 --> 00:03:08,445
He was plastered, waving this.38 revolver
around, threatening to kill himself.

56
00:03:10,956 --> 00:03:11,945
Wow.

57
00:03:15,494 --> 00:03:18,224
So, your mom left and you stayed, right?

58
00:03:19,932 --> 00:03:21,593
Yeah, pretty much.

59
00:03:23,235 --> 00:03:25,965
Well, he promised to get rid of the gun,

60
00:03:26,038 --> 00:03:28,438
and then he went into treatment
for a while.

61
00:03:28,507 --> 00:03:33,069
And then, for whatever reason,
he decided he was into boats.

62
00:03:33,145 --> 00:03:34,874
You know, it's like someone said,

63

You're tough.

I guess what I'm trying to say is it just...

70
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:06,735
It kind of sucks having one parent ditch
and then the other one lose their mind.

71
00:04:12,684 --> 00:04:18,020
I mean, how can I possibly hope
to turn out even remotely functional?

72
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:23,152
Yeah.

73
00:04:28,367 --> 00:04:31,700
Well, I kind of do feel better.

74
00:04:34,306 --> 00:04:35,568
I'm glad.

it's because only guys

00:09:58,263 --> 00:10:01,460

What? Why would it be?

149

Because I know you get a kick out of
doing things that might get you in trouble.

Well, I'm not gonna deny that, but no.

I pretty much liked you
from the first moment that I saw you.

And I had no idea who your father was.

Was that my reward?

Mmm-hmm.

155
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:41,805

the next question?
