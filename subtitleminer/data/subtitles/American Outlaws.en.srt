150
00:13:05,417 --> 00:13:09,251

where you were reassigned
to General Stuart's cavalry...

151
00:13:09,388 --> 00:13:12,016
until you surrendered
in Tennessee.

152
00:13:13,926 --> 00:13:16,292

Sadie was not a man.

00:51:44,968 --> 00:51:48,961
<i>Jimmy's got a point, Cole.</i>
<i>The "Younger-James Gang"is confusing.</i>

736
00:51:49,072 --> 00:51:51,597
- How's that, Bob?
<i>- Well.</i>

737
00:51:51,708 --> 00:51:56,270
Say we burst into a bank, and we yell,
"We're the Younger-James Gang!"

738
00:51:56,379 --> 00:51:59,371
People are gonna be thinkin',
"The youngerJames gang?

739
00:51:59,449 --> 00:52:01,849
<i>- "Is there an olderJames gang?</i>
<i>- [Cole] Hey!</i>

740
00:52:01,952 --> 00:52:04,887
<i>How come we never heard</i>
<i>of the olderJames gang?"</i>

741
00:52:04,988 --> 00:52:07,650
So people tryin' to figure that out
instead of raisin' their arms.

742
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:11,659
- Can't argue with that, Cole.
- Do we even have the same mama? Huh?

743
00:52:11,761 --> 00:52:16,528
<i>Do we? Is anybody hearin'me? Huh?</i>
<i>See, I got a little idea.</i>

744
00:52:16,633 --> 00:52:20,364
If I kill you, then I killJim,
I'm gonna have no arguments.

745
00:52:20,737 --> 00:52:23,672
Pinkerton?
It's been eight months.

746
00:52:23,773 --> 00:52:26,537
<i>I see holdups</i>
<i>and I see robberies.</i>

747
00:52:26,643 --> 00:52:29,203
I don't see men
on the end of nooses.

748
00:52:29,312 --> 00:52:32,941
Most of theseJames Gang's encounters
have been with local law enforcement.

749
00:52:33,016 --> 00:52:35,814
Quite frankly are no match
for this gang's cunning.

750
00:52:35,919 --> 00:52:37,853
- What about your detectives?
- Listen, you!

751
00:52:37,954 --> 00:52:39,649
Shut up.

752
00:52:41,124 --> 00:52:44,457
<i>Now...</i>

753
00:52:44,561 --> 00:52:46,688
I have to hunt this man.

754
00:52:46,796 --> 00:52:51,165
I have to get inside
this man's mind.

755
00:52:51,268 --> 00:52:53,668
I have to anticipate him.

756
00:52:55,105 --> 00:52:58,268
- And that takes time.
- Time, time, time.

757
00:52:58,375 --> 00:53:00,275
I can't believe this.

758
00:53:00,377 --> 00:53:03,073
Would you believe there are
certain towns in Missouri...

759
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:05,944
where theJames Gang
walks openly in the street...

760
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:08,314
<i>- as heroes?</i>
<i>- [Parker]</i>
<i>Now, how can that be?</i>

761
00:53:08,418 --> 00:53:11,251
<i>[Pinkerton]</i>
<i>Because they are charitable.</i>

762
00:53:11,388 --> 00:53:15,324

<i>to churches, to farmers.</i>
- #Was blind #

763
00:53:15,458 --> 00:53:17,926
<i>- #But now I see ##</i>
<i>- They gave the sharecroppers</i>
<i>of Maddox so much money,</i>

764
00:53:18,061 --> 00:53:19,961
<i>they even built a school.</i>

765
00:53:20,063 --> 00:53:23,931
- That's my money.
- Well, sir, we should burn
that school to the ground.

766
00:53:24,034 --> 00:53:27,936
That's the way to win' em
back to our side.

767
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:32,532
<i>Pinkerton, hundreds of men have</i>

768
00:53:32,642 --> 00:53:36,237
but they did their jobs.

769
00:53:36,346 --> 00:53:40,407
<i>Now, this...</i>

Do your job.

771
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:46,087
Then you let me do my job
as I see fit,

772
00:53:46,189 --> 00:53:48,089
without interference.

773
00:53:48,191 --> 00:53:52,958
- What can you tell me?
- It's going to be a long spring.

774
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:55,327
If people would just hand over
their money and not shoot at us,

775
00:53:55,432 --> 00:53:57,332
there'd be a lot less killing.

776
00:54:03,106 --> 00:54:05,904
- What's that?
- It's my lucky rabbit's foot.

777
00:54:06,009 --> 00:54:08,739
Took it off
that dead fellow over there.

778
00:54:08,845 --> 00:54:12,246
- I don't think
that one's working, Loni.
- What?

779
00:54:12,315 --> 00:54:15,478
<i>- [Children Clamoring]</i>

Take us to the West.

782
00:54:21,858 --> 00:54:24,691
Lane, Grogan, you take this.
You take these towns.

783

You remind me of...

784
00:54:26,863 --> 00:54:30,594
Here, write this.
I'm not writing this.

785
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:33,430
[Clears Throat]
Your blue-green eyes remind me of...

786
00:54:33,536 --> 00:54:37,768
- Remind me of that land in the sky.
- The land in the sky.

787
00:54:40,076 --> 00:54:44,012
That "even here."
You might want to change that
to, uh, "I thought of you."

00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:47,982
Ah, look, just write
the whole thing yourself. L...

789
00:55:22,886 --> 00:55:25,855
Okay, sir, I think we know
how this is gonna go.

790
00:55:25,955 --> 00:55:28,321

Crazy!

Bob.

- This is about
the wanted posters, isn't it?
- Yeah.

797
00:55:48,978 --> 00:55:52,914
Obviously someone's not standin' out
in people's minds at the robberies.

798
00:55:52,982 --> 00:55:56,577
Gents, we're in the middle
of somethin' here.

799
00:55:56,686 --> 00:55:58,745
- Yeah, Bob's upset.
- The posters?

800
00:55:58,888 --> 00:56:02,790
- Yeah.
- Don't say "yeah"
in that tone of voice!

801
00:56:02,926 --> 00:56:05,394

- [Whispers] Okay.

802

806

<i>Of course.</i>

- Drinkin' whiskey, Jim?

817
00:56:58,948 --> 00:57:01,815
You're too young
to be drinkin' whiskey.

818
00:57:01,918 --> 00:57:05,149
Not too young to shoot a man,
not too young to drink whiskey.

Ahh!

820
00:57:10,460 --> 00:57:14,021

Tonight?

822

Why, I was just gettin' ready
to go turn on that Younger charm.

823
00:57:22,238 --> 00:57:25,002

- You been with a girl ever?

824
00:57:25,108 --> 00:57:27,338
Hell, yeah,
I've been with a girl!

825
00:57:31,314 --> 00:57:33,942

one of them paid ladies.

- I think so.

827
00:57:38,054 --> 00:57:40,716
I mean, you, Frank,

- Tell you what...

832

Uh! I can't
drink good neither.

So there's only four banks within
that travel radius they've not robbed.

Could you put men

I don't have to.

856

<i>- [Bob] What's the plan, Jesse?</i>

1179
01:28:47,088 --> 01:28:50,353
<i>- Well, Bob, I think my wife and</i>

- A farm?

1180
01:28:50,458 --> 01:28:54,360
- Down in Tennessee.
- Hmm. All right.

1181
01:28:54,462 --> 01:28:59,764
You, uh... You wanna maybe ride
with the Younger Gang for
a while before you do that?

1182
01:28:59,867 --> 01:29:02,165

1186
01:29:11,846 --> 01:29:16,783
And, uh... thanks for that
distraction back there.

1187
01:29:16,884 --> 01:29:19,910
Hell, they hardly
even noticed us.

1188
01:29:20,054 --> 01:29:22,750

- I'll explain on the way.

1191
01:29:28,229 --> 01:29:30,129
All right, boys.

1192
01:29:32,233 --> 01:29:34,963
Let's ride! Hah!

1193
01:29:35,069 --> 01:29:37,970
- When were you plannin' on tellin' me?
- I just did.

1194
01:29:38,072 --> 01:29:40,836
- Only because I asked?
- Damn! Am I ever gonna win with you?

1195
01:29:40,942 --> 01:29:42,933
- Don't change the subject.
