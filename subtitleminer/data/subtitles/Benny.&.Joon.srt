# And I would walk five hundred more

11

30
00:02:55,009 --> 00:02:59,055
So we're planning our next vacation.
I want Australia, she wants ltaly.

31
00:02:59,889 --> 00:03:03,017
I like snorkelling. She likes garlic.

32
00:03:03,226 --> 00:03:07,397
All of a sudden, out of nowhere,
she says to me: do I need her?

33
00:03:08,564 --> 00:03:11,150
Jesus, Benny.
What kind of a question is that?

34
00:03:11,275 --> 00:03:14,612
Need? What does it really mean
to need somebody?

35
00:03:14,821 --> 00:03:16,906
Benny, fuel line.

36
00:03:18,574 --> 00:03:20,743
Waldo, could you answer that phone?

37
00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:25,748
- Hello.
- I need a cheque, Benny. COD.

38
00:03:25,873 --> 00:03:28,167
In a minute. Meet me in the office.

39
00:03:28,251 --> 00:03:30,336
All right.

40
00:03:30,461 --> 00:03:33,589
Whoa! Put that out! I got a fuel line broke.

41
00:03:33,673 --> 00:03:39,512
- Hey, Benny. Joon's on the phone again.
- I'll call back. Find out what she wants.

42
00:03:39,637 --> 00:03:41,806
It's an emergency.

43
00:03:41,931 --> 00:03:45,685
She says you're runnin' low
on Peanut Butter Super Chunks.

44
00:03:47,145 --> 00:03:49,105
An emergency...

45
00:03:54,026 --> 00:03:57,572
The issue is jelly. You only like two kinds.

46
00:03:59,949 --> 00:04:03,828
You either like grape or boysenberry.
Which is it? All right.

47
00:04:04,036 --> 00:04:09,333
Yeah, yeah, yeah, peanut butter. I know.
Super Crunch. I'll see you at six, OK? Bye.

48
00:04:11,002 --> 00:04:13,004
Thanks for waitin', ma'am.

49
00:04:13,212 --> 00:04:16,340
I'm afraid the best
we can do for you is gonna be...

50
00:04:18,092 --> 00:04:23,097
It's gonna be $750. If you check around,
you'll see that that is a really good deal.

51
00:04:23,222 --> 00:04:26,225
- Yeah?
- That is a really very good deal, ma'am.

52
00:04:27,185 --> 00:04:29,687
A little too good.

53
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:33,733
Let's do it.

54
00:04:49,165 --> 00:04:51,167
Come here. Come here.

55
00:05:02,303 --> 00:05:05,431
You're not doing your job!
What is your job, anyway?

56
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:08,142
To clean this house, but not any more!

57
00:05:08,267 --> 00:05:12,021
- Get out of my sight!
- You wouldn't dare, Joon!

58
00:05:14,398 --> 00:05:16,817
What is going on here? Joon?

59
00:05:16,901 --> 00:05:19,820
Mrs Smail, please, let me explain.

60
00:05:19,946 --> 00:05:22,740
Beware, the winds of reason
shall blow stern.

61
00:05:22,949 --> 00:05:24,951
- What?
- I'm done, Mr Pearl.

62
00:05:25,159 --> 00:05:27,328
I'm done! The mule's turned to glue!

63
00:05:27,453 --> 00:05:30,873
She wanders off unescorted.
She has sudden outbursts.

64
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:33,084
She's simply unmanageable.

65
00:05:33,918 --> 00:05:36,629
Mrs Smail, wait. Please, let me talk to her.

66
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:40,383
I can talk to her.
You can't quit on such short notice.

67
00:05:40,466 --> 00:05:43,177
I'm sorry, sir. In lreland, we have a sayin'.

68
00:05:43,302 --> 00:05:46,305
"When a boat runs ashore,
the sea has spoken."

69
00:05:49,767 --> 00:05:52,562
Come on! We can't play
three-handed poker.

70
00:05:52,687 --> 00:05:57,149
She's gonna be alone every day.
I'm not leavin' her alone at night, too.

71
00:05:57,358 --> 00:06:02,154
- So bring her. Shejust paints and reads.
- Yeah, and lights things on fire.

72
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:05,700
That happened once.
I got a fire extinguisher. Just bring her.

73
00:06:05,908 --> 00:06:09,662
Get your ass over here.
Don't forget the Louis Prima record.

74
00:06:09,787 --> 00:06:11,872
Remember, always play for keeps.

75
00:06:12,081 --> 00:06:15,835
All right, all right, all right.
Yeah, I'll be there. OK.

76
00:06:18,129 --> 00:06:20,214
Joon, dinner!

77
00:06:30,308 --> 00:06:32,810
Spaghetti and salad?

78
00:06:32,935 --> 00:06:35,021
In that order?

79
00:06:36,689 --> 00:06:39,275
What happened between
you and Mrs Smail?

80
00:06:40,443 --> 00:06:43,446
She was given to fits of
semiprecious metaphors.

81
00:06:43,654 --> 00:06:46,365
She's a housekeeper,
not an English professor.

82
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:48,784
She moves things.

83
00:06:48,993 --> 00:06:51,370
She said you wandered off.

84
00:06:51,579 --> 00:06:54,081
Did you leave the house alone?

85
00:06:54,206 --> 00:06:56,292
Define "alone".

86
00:06:56,792 --> 00:07:00,129
You know full well what I'm talkin' about.

87
00:07:00,463 --> 00:07:05,885
I can't be worried about you knocking
another housekeeper into retirement.

88
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:08,471
First, it was Mrs Larkspur.

89
00:07:08,596 --> 00:07:11,807
A woman deeply
and hygienically disturbed.

90
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:14,852
- Her hair smelled.
- But then it was Mrs Piltz.

91
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,231
Piltz? The answer's in the question.

92
00:07:22,234 --> 00:07:26,197
Let's face it, Benjamin.
Hiring housekeepers is not your forte.

93
00:07:26,405 --> 00:07:32,244
Well, until I do find another housekeeper,
you are gonna stick close to the house.

94
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:34,330
understand?

95
00:07:36,207 --> 00:07:40,795
Now have some salad. By the way, I want
you to come with me to my poker game.

96
00:07:42,588 --> 00:07:45,716
- Benny...
- Come on. You'll have a good time.

97
00:08:28,467 --> 00:08:30,553
Web belt and buckle.

98
00:08:32,096 --> 00:08:35,224
Classical Greek martini shaker.

99
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:37,518
Six turkey-feather darts.

100
00:08:38,686 --> 00:08:41,689
I'll see you with a Deanna Durbin album.

101
00:08:42,523 --> 00:08:44,525
Come on.

102
00:08:44,734 --> 00:08:49,739
- And I'll raise you with a stethoscope.
- Does it have little plastic earpieces?

103
00:08:49,947 --> 00:08:54,201
- What do you care? You never win, Mike.
- I don't want 'em stabbin' my eardrums.

104
00:08:54,326 --> 00:08:56,620
Steering-wheel knob.

105
00:08:56,829 --> 00:08:58,998
Salad Shooter.

106
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,334
'56 Plymouth tyre iron.

107
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:06,088
- Fold-o.
- You must have a good hand, huh?

108
00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:09,425
No, I'm bluffin'.

109
00:09:11,093 --> 00:09:13,179
Really?

110
00:09:15,181 --> 00:09:17,558
Come on. You gotta play to find out.

111
00:09:17,683 --> 00:09:21,937
OK. 1 50 feet of coaxial cable. Show 'em.

112
00:09:22,354 --> 00:09:25,608
- Full house. Jacks over fours.
- Oh, shit.

113
00:09:28,736 --> 00:09:30,696
I thought he was bluffin'.

114
00:09:30,905 --> 00:09:33,324
Will someone get some air to his brain?

115
00:09:33,532 --> 00:09:36,327
He was bluffing about bluffing.

116
00:09:36,452 --> 00:09:38,412
You're a real pal, Benny.

117
00:09:38,621 --> 00:09:42,917
I got a solution to your housekeeper
problem. You can have my roommate.

118
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,005
That's a terrific offer, Benjamin. Save
you from the chore of Smail shopping.

119
00:09:48,214 --> 00:09:50,508
Those places are such drudgery.

120
00:09:50,633 --> 00:09:54,053
Montgomery and Smails,
Smails and Roebuck, Smails-R-us...

121
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:56,263
Joon.

122
00:09:57,097 --> 00:10:00,643
- When did you get a roommate?
- Since last week.

123
00:10:00,851 --> 00:10:05,231
My cousin pounded into town and life's
gone from heaven to hell in seven days.

124
00:10:06,357 --> 00:10:10,319
- Just like the good Lord intended.
- 26 years old, he can't even read.

125
00:10:10,528 --> 00:10:13,030
Spends all day polishing my plastic forks.

126
00:10:13,155 --> 00:10:16,700
When you say he can't read,
what do you mean? Like words?

127
00:10:16,909 --> 00:10:20,746
Yeah. And he keeps me up all night
watchin' stupid old movies.

128
00:10:20,871 --> 00:10:22,957
My work's starting to suffer.

129
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:27,545
- You install cable TV.
- Joon, will you please glue your sequins?

130
00:10:29,713 --> 00:10:33,467
Have we an internal sequin issue
to deal with, Benjamin?

131
00:10:33,592 --> 00:10:36,178
All right, can we make this the last hand?

132
00:10:39,932 --> 00:10:42,017
Come on, come on. Play cards.

133
00:10:44,228 --> 00:10:47,773
Two tickets,
tomorrow night's baseball game.

134
00:10:49,108 --> 00:10:51,402
One Pocket Fisherman.

135
00:10:52,361 --> 00:10:54,530
- Fold.
- Do you ever stay in?

136
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:01,328
Snorkel mask.

137
00:12:08,771 --> 00:12:11,065
She knows how to rattle the day help.

138
00:12:11,273 --> 00:12:15,444
I think we need to find someone
more understanding than Mrs Smail.

139
00:12:16,278 --> 00:12:18,572
Tell me, how are you two getting along?

140
00:12:18,697 --> 00:12:20,658
us?

141
00:12:20,783 --> 00:12:23,786
Fine. Normal. You know, fine.

142
00:12:23,911 --> 00:12:25,871
- Why?
- I'll level with you.

143
00:12:26,288 --> 00:12:30,793
I think it's time you gave some
serious consideration to a group home.

144
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:35,255
- She already has a home.
- Benny, she'd be with her peers.

145
00:12:35,381 --> 00:12:39,843
She hates her peers. She's already quit
the two day centres to prove it.

146
00:12:39,969 --> 00:12:42,680
Look, all we need right now
is a new housekeeper.

147
00:12:42,888 --> 00:12:46,850
Well, I know of no one else.
You've been up and down the list.

148
00:12:47,059 --> 00:12:50,062
You might want to consider
that there are some people

149
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:53,941
more capable of handling
these episodes than you.

150
00:12:56,026 --> 00:13:00,280
I think that you two living together
may not be the best thing any more.

151
00:13:01,865 --> 00:13:04,868
I'm her brother, and I'm her only family.

152
00:13:04,994 --> 00:13:09,248
And we've done just fine,
the two of us, for 1 2 years.

153
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:15,295
Yes, but her stress level is always
a factor in her display of symptoms.

154
00:13:15,421 --> 00:13:18,632
Her agitation should
be kept to a minimum.

155
00:13:18,757 --> 00:13:21,969
Everybody gets agitated.
Sometimes it's the only option.

156
00:13:22,094 --> 00:13:24,471
Benny, don't get me wrong.

157
00:13:24,596 --> 00:13:28,142
I'm impressed how
you've managed this long.

158
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:32,104
But a group home would let her
develop other relationships.

159
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:35,858
We don't know this,
but what if she were capable of a job?

160
00:13:35,941 --> 00:13:38,444
They'd encourage her in that direction.

161
00:13:38,569 --> 00:13:43,240
These are very nice places -
nurturing, supportive.

162
00:13:43,449 --> 00:13:45,451
I'm not farming her out.

163
00:14:09,933 --> 00:14:13,187
I have every right to be outside, Officer.

164
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:15,355
- I have every right.
- Yes, ma'am.

165
00:14:15,981 --> 00:14:18,484
May I see some ID, please?

166
00:14:32,164 --> 00:14:37,169
- Waldo, did you start that brake job yet?
- Joon called. You've run out of tapioca.

167
00:14:37,252 --> 00:14:40,798
- She what?
- Oh, and the police will corroborate.

168
00:14:42,883 --> 00:14:44,968
Holy shit.

169
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:50,390
Listen, Jack, you wanna go
to the baseball game tonight?

170
00:14:50,516 --> 00:14:52,684
- Hey, thanks, Benny.
- Box seats.

171
00:14:56,355 --> 00:14:58,315
Hello? Joon?

172
00:15:14,706 --> 00:15:16,667
Time for your medicine, Joon.

173
00:16:17,895 --> 00:16:19,855
Good night, Steve.

174
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:34,870
- Oh, hello. How's it goin'?
- I appreciate the deal on the engine.

175
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:39,458
- No problem. Is it runnin' all right?
- Yeah, it's running great.

176
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:42,169
- Good.
- So... can l...

177
00:16:42,294 --> 00:16:44,671
Can I make it up to you with some dinner?

178
00:16:46,048 --> 00:16:48,133
Some dinner?

179
00:16:48,217 --> 00:16:51,470
- Are you serious?
- Yeah. Dinner with you.

180
00:16:55,015 --> 00:16:57,184
You know what? I can't.

181
00:16:57,392 --> 00:16:59,686
- I mean, I'd like to...
- It's OK.

182
00:16:59,895 --> 00:17:01,897
OK.

183
00:17:05,651 --> 00:17:07,611
Stupid. Stupid.

184
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:23,669
- 18-1 5.
- 17-16.

185
00:17:23,794 --> 00:17:26,296
- 18-1 5!
- It caught the corner.

186
00:17:26,922 --> 00:17:29,716
- It was a foot off the table.
- It was not.

187
00:17:29,925 --> 00:17:31,927
- Juniper...
- Benjamin...

188
00:17:32,135 --> 00:17:35,973
Don't underestimate the mentally ill.
We know how to count.

189
00:17:36,181 --> 00:17:40,894
- OK, fine. 17-16.
- You can't give me what was mine.

190
00:17:41,103 --> 00:17:43,397
- You're trying to cheat.
- I'm not.

191
00:17:43,605 --> 00:17:47,025
- You're cheating.
- Joon, you're the one who's cheating.

192
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:50,570
You're all trying to cheat me.
You're trying to cheat.

193
00:18:04,459 --> 00:18:08,422
Yeah. I spoke to some of the guys
on the staff, Benny.

194
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:10,716
Nobody wants to be a housekeeper.

195
00:18:12,801 --> 00:18:17,889
I will. I'll keep tryin'. But I gotta
tell you honestly, I don't think so.

196
00:18:18,015 --> 00:18:20,100
Yeah. OK. Thanks.

197
00:18:20,934 --> 00:18:23,020
Bye.

198
00:19:03,769 --> 00:19:05,771
OK, Stevie.

199
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:39,846
I mean, I can't even keep a goldfish alive.
What chance do I have with Joon?

200
00:19:40,055 --> 00:19:42,682
If somethin' bad happened to her, I'd...

201
00:19:44,768 --> 00:19:47,896
I'd never ever be able to forgive myself.

202
00:19:48,105 --> 00:19:51,024
A group home
is the right thing for her, Benny.

203
00:19:51,233 --> 00:19:54,152
Yeah. This is definitely for her own good.

204
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:58,115
Hey, it's for both your own good.

205
00:19:59,574 --> 00:20:02,285
How much longer
can you do this to yourself?

206
00:20:02,369 --> 00:20:04,663
Your life is literally passing you by.

207
00:20:07,165 --> 00:20:09,793
You're right.

208
00:20:10,001 --> 00:20:12,587
You're right.
What am I doing with myself?

209
00:20:14,172 --> 00:20:18,218
I spend my life workin' on cars
and takin' care of my sister.

210
00:20:18,427 --> 00:20:23,765
I can't have a relationship without havin'
to worry about how Joon is gonna fit in.

211
00:20:23,974 --> 00:20:27,519
Once she gets settled in,
you could actually take a vacation.

212
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:30,522
Travel a little. I can hold down the fort.

213
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:32,732
Travel?

214
00:20:33,567 --> 00:20:38,029
- Travel?
- Benny, there's a whole world out there.

215
00:20:38,238 --> 00:20:40,949
I mean, picture yourself on the open road.

216
00:20:41,074 --> 00:20:43,577
Wind in the hair in the EI Camino.

217
00:20:43,785 --> 00:20:46,079
Highway stretchin' out...

218
00:20:46,163 --> 00:20:48,248
What's that, up ahead?

219
00:20:49,082 --> 00:20:51,376
A lovely motorist, stranded.

220
00:20:51,501 --> 00:20:54,504
Carburettor trouble. Better investigate.

221
00:20:54,629 --> 00:20:57,966
Yeah, right.
I'm gonna be stoppin' every 1 5 minutes

222
00:20:58,175 --> 00:21:00,469
to call Joon to see how she's doin'.

223
00:21:03,054 --> 00:21:06,808
OK, let's see. Black Sabbath, over there.

224
00:21:06,933 --> 00:21:10,145
- Is that a flashlight?
- It's a brush kind of a thing.

225
00:21:10,353 --> 00:21:12,439
Here's a hat.

226
00:21:12,564 --> 00:21:15,775
- Where's the batteries?
- You didn't win batteries.

227
00:21:15,984 --> 00:21:18,695
- Those are mine.
- OK. Hey, guys, hurry it up!

228
00:21:18,904 --> 00:21:20,906
Or we'll start without you.

229
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:24,326
I've been known to play a little cards.

230
00:21:44,471 --> 00:21:46,556
Box of 30-aught-6 cartridges.

231
00:21:51,436 --> 00:21:53,730
Medium-sized, green-haired troll.

232
00:21:54,981 --> 00:21:57,067
Soap-on-a-rope, slightly used.

233
00:21:59,986 --> 00:22:02,072
- Cards?
- Three.

234
00:22:03,114 --> 00:22:05,200
- Cards?
- Two.

235
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:08,245
And the dealer takes...

236
00:22:08,954 --> 00:22:11,039
three.

237
00:22:14,918 --> 00:22:17,003
Pass.

238
00:22:19,172 --> 00:22:21,258
Re-grout my shower. Blue grout.

239
00:22:22,634 --> 00:22:24,594
I fold.

240
00:22:27,013 --> 00:22:28,974
Shampoo my dog.

241
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:31,685
Lava lamp.

242
00:22:34,312 --> 00:22:36,481
Paint the exterior of my house.

243
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:40,777
Hey, come on, slow down.
This is supposed to be reasonable stakes.

244
00:22:40,986 --> 00:22:44,614
That's a see and a raise. You follow me?

245
00:22:50,579 --> 00:22:54,749
- You take my cousin off my hands.
- Wait, wait, wait. Just stop.

246
00:22:54,833 --> 00:22:58,712
- Benny's gonna strangle you guys.
- Chill out, Thomas.

247
00:23:01,631 --> 00:23:04,009
- Joon, we gotta go.
- Flush!

248
00:23:08,722 --> 00:23:11,099
Full house.

249
00:23:12,058 --> 00:23:14,144
Yes. Yes!

250
00:23:14,227 --> 00:23:18,607
- Benny, tonight's your lucky night.
- Mike warned her it was for keeps.

251
00:23:18,732 --> 00:23:21,026
What? What was for keeps?

252
00:23:22,694 --> 00:23:24,863
I lost.

253
00:23:25,071 --> 00:23:29,242
- What's in the pot?
- A cousin.

254
00:23:58,647 --> 00:24:02,192
Rules are rules. Without 'em
there's no order in the universe.

255
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,528
Don't you give me that crap.
You took advantage.

256
00:24:05,654 --> 00:24:10,241
Of your sick sister. A heart flush
is a perfectly respectable hand.

257
00:24:10,325 --> 00:24:12,952
- Not respectable enough.
- Hey, shut up, Mike.

258
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:16,790
I am not takin' this guy home.

259
00:24:16,915 --> 00:24:19,834
You have to! Remember
the bet I lost last year?

260
00:24:19,918 --> 00:24:23,046
When I had to re-plate your socket set,
I didn't back out.

261
00:24:23,254 --> 00:24:26,591
You can't bet a human being!

262
00:24:27,217 --> 00:24:29,928
Oh, well,
if you're gonna be a baby about it...

263
00:24:30,053 --> 00:24:33,682
All right, Mike.
You wanna play like that? I'll take him.

264
00:24:34,516 --> 00:24:39,854
I may not be responsible for what
I'm gonna do to him, but I'll take him.

265
00:24:48,196 --> 00:24:50,156
Oh, man.

266
00:24:53,076 --> 00:24:56,538
- What are you doin', you jerk?
- Somethin' wrong with your car.

267
00:24:56,746 --> 00:24:59,666
- What did you do with my hubcaps?
- I don't know.

268
00:25:05,088 --> 00:25:07,674
- I'm Sam.
- So I hear.

269
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:11,136
I'm Benny.

270
00:25:12,595 --> 00:25:14,681
With an n?

271
00:25:15,306 --> 00:25:17,392
Yeah. Two of 'em.

272
00:25:19,894 --> 00:25:22,063
- This is Joon.
- With an n?

273
00:25:23,523 --> 00:25:25,525
One.

274
00:25:27,694 --> 00:25:30,196
You're out of your tree.

275
00:25:31,156 --> 00:25:33,241
It's not my tree.

276
00:25:34,367 --> 00:25:36,453
I think I need a beer.

277
00:25:38,246 --> 00:25:43,126
Hey, Benny, wait a minute! Where are you
going? Come here! Gimme a jump! Hey!

278
00:25:55,346 --> 00:25:57,307
You're goin' with them.

279
00:26:09,819 --> 00:26:11,905
Oh! God bless you.

280
00:27:29,065 --> 00:27:32,193
Hey, pal, we're tryin' to work here,
if you don't mind.

281
00:27:32,944 --> 00:27:34,904
Oh, my God!

282
00:27:35,655 --> 00:27:40,535
"I've been looking for my boyfriend.
Have you seen him?"

283
00:27:40,743 --> 00:27:42,745
Ruthie, a ghost come back to haunt you?

284
00:27:44,289 --> 00:27:47,333
"Oh, Brad! Oh, Brad!
Brad, please don't be dead!"

285
00:27:47,417 --> 00:27:51,504
"I never got a chance to tell you what
you meant to me. Oh, Brad, please!"

286
00:27:51,713 --> 00:27:56,509
It's you, Ruthie Mallenek, co-star of The
Prom Queen Mutilator with Dick Beebee.

287
00:27:56,718 --> 00:27:59,220
- You saw that?
- "He was mine!"

288
00:27:59,429 --> 00:28:00,972
"He was mine!"

289
00:28:01,097 --> 00:28:04,517
"No. Cindy, you're sick. You need help!"

290
00:28:04,642 --> 00:28:07,770
"No, Cindy! No! No!"

291
00:28:07,854 --> 00:28:09,939
"No!"

292
00:29:13,962 --> 00:29:16,255
Don't... Don't touch it.

293
00:29:16,381 --> 00:29:18,549
It's paint.

294
00:29:18,675 --> 00:29:20,760
Yes.

295
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:29,185
Kirk Douglas. Van Gogh. Ear.

296
00:29:33,564 --> 00:29:36,609
These are yours.
You can sleep here. All right?

297
00:29:39,612 --> 00:29:42,532
It's late. Let's brush your teeth and hair.

298
00:29:43,574 --> 00:29:47,245
- I can brush my own teeth, Benjamin.
- Fine.

299
00:29:47,328 --> 00:29:49,414
- Hair, too.
- Perfect.

300
00:29:49,539 --> 00:29:51,499
Come on.

301
00:29:55,795 --> 00:29:57,755
Oh. Oh, Benny.

302
00:29:57,964 --> 00:29:59,632
Hey, Benny.

303
00:30:00,174 --> 00:30:04,137
Thanks for the couch.
Mike made me sleep under the sink.

304
00:30:04,637 --> 00:30:06,639
Oh. You're welcome.

305
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:09,851
- Good night.
- Good night.

306
00:31:29,013 --> 00:31:30,973
Mentally ill.

307
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:35,561
- Really?
- Yeah.

308
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:38,064
But, I mean, don't worry about it.

309
00:31:38,272 --> 00:31:42,985
But just let her go about her routine.
Her routine is everything to her.

310
00:31:43,069 --> 00:31:46,614
Oh, and don't hang around her room
while she's painting.

311
00:31:46,739 --> 00:31:48,825
- She hates that.
- No.

312
00:31:48,908 --> 00:31:51,828
If she runs hot and cold on you,
just ignore it.

313
00:31:52,036 --> 00:31:54,038
That's just the way it works.

314
00:31:57,375 --> 00:32:03,089
Listen, if she starts talkin' to herself,
don't worry about it, but don't answer.

315
00:32:04,048 --> 00:32:04,966
OK.

316
00:32:05,174 --> 00:32:10,388
She sometimes hears voices in her head.
That comes with the territory, too.

317
00:32:10,721 --> 00:32:16,853
And... just make sure that nothin'
- and, you know, I mean nothin' -

318
00:32:16,978 --> 00:32:19,272
happens to her.

319
00:32:21,232 --> 00:32:22,817
OK.

320
00:32:23,025 --> 00:32:25,611
OK. All right.

321
00:33:34,639 --> 00:33:36,849
Having a Boo Radley moment, are we?

322
00:33:55,284 --> 00:33:57,995
- Morning.
- Hey. This today?

323
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:00,081
Yeah.

324
00:34:02,083 --> 00:34:04,877
So... what'd you do with the cousin?

325
00:34:05,836 --> 00:34:09,674
The bus station? The river?
What? You throw him in the river?

326
00:34:10,841 --> 00:34:13,844
- No, I took him home.
- You took him home?

327
00:34:13,970 --> 00:34:16,055
- Yeah.
- To your house?

328
00:34:16,138 --> 00:34:19,058
- Yeah, to my house.
- What, are you crazy?

329
00:34:19,267 --> 00:34:21,686
Hey, believe me, it's only temporary.

330
00:34:21,894 --> 00:34:25,648
Great. Hey, maybe he can tell Joon
about the group home, huh?

331
00:34:26,983 --> 00:34:32,113
If I'm gonna do this group-home thing,
I gotta figure out the best way to tell her.

332
00:34:32,196 --> 00:34:34,282
Where's Waldo? ls he not here yet?

333
00:34:34,407 --> 00:34:38,160
- No.
- That's it. I'm gonna have a talk with him.

334
00:34:38,369 --> 00:34:41,372
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am. What's his phone number?

335
00:34:41,497 --> 00:34:44,500
555-0944.

336
00:35:08,274 --> 00:35:12,361
# Too late to cry, she turned away

337
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:14,947
# I started pushin'

338
00:35:16,824 --> 00:35:20,911
# I saw no future in this lack

339
00:35:20,995 --> 00:35:23,706
# I started pushin'

340
00:35:23,831 --> 00:35:25,916
# Pushin', pushin' forward back

341
00:35:26,125 --> 00:35:27,877
# I was pushin'

342
00:35:28,002 --> 00:35:29,879
# Pushin', pushin' forward back

343
00:35:30,087 --> 00:35:32,173
Too loud! Too loud!

344
00:35:33,424 --> 00:35:35,092
# Pushin' forward back

345
00:35:35,176 --> 00:35:37,470
What?

346
00:35:38,095 --> 00:35:39,347
What? Oh!

347
00:36:29,605 --> 00:36:31,690
Hey.

348
00:36:33,067 --> 00:36:35,027
Where's Sam?

349
00:36:36,278 --> 00:36:40,574
I didn't mean to kick him out. I mean,
I didn't kick him out, he just left.

350
00:36:40,658 --> 00:36:42,743
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

351
00:36:42,868 --> 00:36:45,371
What happened? Did something happen?

352
00:36:46,414 --> 00:36:48,582
He just... He just left.

353
00:36:48,707 --> 00:36:50,793
He was... He was...

354
00:36:50,876 --> 00:36:52,962
in the air and, and, and...

355
00:36:54,130 --> 00:36:56,841
with a thing and... It was really loud...

356
00:36:57,675 --> 00:36:59,635
It was really loud.

357
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:03,305
And I just kept seeing...

358
00:37:05,057 --> 00:37:07,476
He didn't mean to do it.

359
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:10,604
Do it? What?

360
00:37:10,813 --> 00:37:12,773
What did he... What did he do?

361
00:37:15,067 --> 00:37:17,278
He cleaned the house.

362
00:37:29,165 --> 00:37:31,667
And you kicked him out for that?

363
00:38:00,321 --> 00:38:02,615
Maybe I should invite him back in.

364
00:38:03,574 --> 00:38:08,662
Yeah. Before someone sticks a stamp
on his head and mails him to Guam.

365
00:39:03,634 --> 00:39:06,136
Some cultures...

366
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:09,348
are defined by their
relationship to cheese.

367
00:39:10,933 --> 00:39:13,018
Is that a fact?

368
00:39:27,074 --> 00:39:29,159
He can really cook, can't he?

369
00:39:31,579 --> 00:39:33,455
Yeah.

370
00:39:33,539 --> 00:39:37,209
Although, for grilled cheese,
I might've used the wool setting.

371
00:39:37,293 --> 00:39:39,378
That's what I told him.

372
00:39:41,797 --> 00:39:43,882
Really?

373
00:39:45,009 --> 00:39:47,636
- What did he use?
- Rayon.

374
00:39:49,096 --> 00:39:51,265
Silk would've been too soggy.

375
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:53,892
- Cotton would've...
- Would've burned it.

376
00:39:54,101 --> 00:39:56,061
Right.

377
00:39:56,687 --> 00:40:01,191
Fortunately he consulted me
before giving it steam. I was against it.

378
00:40:09,325 --> 00:40:11,285
I wish he could be my new Smail.

379
00:40:26,008 --> 00:40:30,888
# The melodious songs of the blessed

380
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:37,353
# And our spirits shall sorrow no more

381
00:40:38,312 --> 00:40:43,942
# Not a sigh for the blessing of rest

382
00:40:44,985 --> 00:40:50,074
# ln the sweet by-and-by

383
00:40:50,824 --> 00:40:56,455
# We shall meet on that beautiful shore

384
00:40:57,289 --> 00:41:02,086
# ln the sweet by-and-by

385
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:08,008
# We shall meet on that beautiful shore

386
00:41:57,850 --> 00:41:59,852
Good night.

387
00:42:00,477 --> 00:42:02,563
Good night.

388
00:42:22,583 --> 00:42:24,543
You need some help?

389
00:42:30,716 --> 00:42:34,970
"Dear Mom, I've departed Mike's
with love and gratitude

390
00:42:35,095 --> 00:42:40,184
and am now living with Benny and
Joon Pearl, two devoted new friends."

391
00:42:40,809 --> 00:42:45,314
"Benny's predisposition to hypertense
lrish monologists notwithstanding,

392
00:42:45,522 --> 00:42:47,900
he has given me a job
as a domestic engineer

393
00:42:48,025 --> 00:42:50,319
and seems pleased with me so far."

394
00:42:50,527 --> 00:42:52,613
"Love, Sam."

395
00:42:52,821 --> 00:42:54,782
Wow.

396
00:42:54,907 --> 00:42:57,409
I didn't know I could talk like that.

397
00:43:15,219 --> 00:43:17,221
Tapioca?

398
00:43:17,930 --> 00:43:19,932
Oh. Yeah.

399
00:43:29,942 --> 00:43:32,027
- OK.
- Thank you, Ruthie.

400
00:43:33,070 --> 00:43:36,615
You're welcome, Sam.
Let me know if you need anything, OK?

401
00:43:43,497 --> 00:43:45,791
You don't like raisins?

402
00:43:45,874 --> 00:43:48,377
- Not really.
- Why?

403
00:43:51,713 --> 00:43:53,715
They used to be...

404
00:43:53,924 --> 00:43:56,510
fat and juicy.

405
00:43:56,635 --> 00:44:00,055
And now they're twisted.
They had their lives stolen.

406
00:44:02,766 --> 00:44:06,728
They taste sweet, but really
they're just humiliated grapes.

407
00:44:08,730 --> 00:44:12,150
I can't say I'm a big supporter
of the raisin council.

408
00:44:12,985 --> 00:44:18,115
Did you see those raisins on TV?
The ones that sing and dance and stuff?

409
00:44:18,323 --> 00:44:20,909
- They scare me.
- Yeah. Me, too.

410
00:44:21,034 --> 00:44:25,289
It's sick. They make them sing
and dance so people will eat them.

411
00:44:26,748 --> 00:44:28,834
It's a shame about raisins.

412
00:44:29,585 --> 00:44:31,545
- Cannibals.
- Yeah.

413
00:44:35,632 --> 00:44:38,135
Do you like avocados?

414
00:44:38,343 --> 00:44:40,304
They're a fruit, you know.

415
00:44:41,263 --> 00:44:42,931
Ruthie?

416
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:45,100
Do you got any avocados?

417
00:44:59,615 --> 00:45:01,700
Joon?

418
00:45:13,045 --> 00:45:16,173
You're very pretty
when you're off work, Ruthie.

419
00:45:16,715 --> 00:45:21,094
- Thank you. Maybe I should quit my job.
- Where the hell have you two been?

420
00:45:21,303 --> 00:45:24,097
Don't worry. They were with me,
running some errands.

421
00:45:24,306 --> 00:45:26,308
- Oh, hi. How you doin'?
- Hi.

422
00:45:26,516 --> 00:45:29,102
Running errands? You ran an errand?

423
00:45:29,227 --> 00:45:31,396
Yes, I did. I ran an errand.

424
00:45:33,607 --> 00:45:36,818
They're both named Steven.
One with a v and one with a ph.

425
00:45:37,027 --> 00:45:41,949
- Look, look, look! Ruthie's movie.
- Yes. And she's staying for dinner, too.

426
00:45:44,242 --> 00:45:46,328
Come on in. Come on in.

427
00:45:50,290 --> 00:45:53,085
- So why'd you leave?
- LA?

428
00:45:53,210 --> 00:45:55,170
I wasn't that good of an actress.

429
00:45:55,379 --> 00:45:57,798
Well, that's not how Sam tells it.

430
00:45:57,881 --> 00:46:02,260
- He's ravin' about you.
- Well, he's sweeter than he is judgmental.

431
00:46:07,057 --> 00:46:09,142
How long have you known him?

432
00:46:09,267 --> 00:46:13,522
Sam? uh... 72 hours.

433
00:46:13,647 --> 00:46:15,607
- Be serious.
- I am serious.

434
00:46:15,816 --> 00:46:18,235
- Really?
- I'm always serious.

435
00:46:19,069 --> 00:46:21,154
I'm too serious.

436
00:46:27,411 --> 00:46:32,290
D'you ever get to the point in your life
where nothin' makes any sense?

437
00:46:35,752 --> 00:46:37,838
Brad? Brad?

438
00:46:41,883 --> 00:46:45,012
Quit kidding around.
This isn't funny any more.

439
00:46:46,805 --> 00:46:49,391
Can we turn this off?
Can we just turn this off?

440
00:46:49,516 --> 00:46:50,767
No!

441
00:46:51,601 --> 00:46:53,562
You!

442
00:46:53,770 --> 00:46:55,355
Cindy!

443
00:46:55,439 --> 00:46:58,900
Why did you do this? You're sick.

444
00:46:58,984 --> 00:47:01,403
You need help.

445
00:47:01,486 --> 00:47:04,531
Let me... Don't!

446
00:47:04,948 --> 00:47:08,368
He was mine. He was mine!

447
00:47:08,493 --> 00:47:11,079
And ifl can't have him, no one can.

448
00:47:11,204 --> 00:47:16,418
Not even you.
You didn't have to buy that same dress.

449
00:47:16,501 --> 00:47:18,920
But you are my sister, Cindy.

450
00:47:19,004 --> 00:47:24,634
I'm sorry about Brad. We didn't mean to
fall in love at the party. Itjust happened.

451
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:29,222
Let's just forget it. There'll be
other boys, other midnight swims,

452
00:47:29,431 --> 00:47:31,433
other prom dresses.

453
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:34,770
No! No, Cindy!

454
00:47:47,991 --> 00:47:50,619
Try it again.

455
00:47:55,207 --> 00:47:58,210
Ah. There's only two reasons
a car won't start:

456
00:47:58,418 --> 00:48:02,089
either you're not gettin' fuel
or you're not gettin' fire.

457
00:48:02,172 --> 00:48:04,257
You've got fire.

458
00:48:05,008 --> 00:48:07,719
I think you'd better let me drive you home.

459
00:48:09,888 --> 00:48:12,099
- Sorry.
- Thanks.

460
00:48:26,488 --> 00:48:28,782
Here it is. It's right here.

461
00:48:28,865 --> 00:48:30,951
- Second job, huh?
- Yeah.

462
00:48:31,076 --> 00:48:33,453
Gotta make those ends meet, you know.

463
00:48:39,417 --> 00:48:41,795
This is just how I imagined your place.

464
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:46,091
- Well...
- You wanna come in?

465
00:48:46,174 --> 00:48:48,260
Or you wanna...

466
00:48:48,385 --> 00:48:50,345
Oh. No.

467
00:48:50,554 --> 00:48:52,973
I'll come in. For a minute.

468
00:48:54,516 --> 00:48:56,518
Whoa! What is this?

469
00:48:58,603 --> 00:49:01,940
- Nice place.
- Pretty nice fish Joon gave you.

470
00:49:02,149 --> 00:49:04,109
Oh, yeah. Those fish.

471
00:49:04,234 --> 00:49:06,820
Yeah, I was shocked. I was...

472
00:49:06,945 --> 00:49:10,157
- Nice fish. I mean, yeah...
- I never had a fish.

473
00:49:10,282 --> 00:49:12,242
What? Not even as a kid?

474
00:49:13,201 --> 00:49:17,372
No. underprivileged childhood, I guess.

475
00:49:17,455 --> 00:49:20,167
- Downright un-American, if you ask me.
- Yeah.

476
00:49:20,292 --> 00:49:25,797
- You can have one of mine, if you want.
- No, I couldn't possibly. They were a gift.

477
00:49:25,922 --> 00:49:30,802
But we could share it. Like joint custody.
You could take it on the weekends.

478
00:49:32,387 --> 00:49:34,347
What is this?

479
00:49:34,472 --> 00:49:37,684
Sit down, son. You're makin' me nervous.

480
00:49:51,865 --> 00:49:53,950
- Wanna beer?
- Yeah.

481
00:49:58,038 --> 00:50:00,123
You know what? I better not.

482
00:50:00,207 --> 00:50:03,251
I gotta get goin'. I better get goin', OK?

483
00:50:03,335 --> 00:50:05,545
Yeah.

484
00:50:05,629 --> 00:50:08,340
- OK.
- I'll take a rain check on the beer.

485
00:50:08,465 --> 00:50:10,425
I got the doors.

486
00:50:11,176 --> 00:50:13,261
- Wanna go to dinner?
- Ever been married?

487
00:50:13,470 --> 00:50:15,430
- No.
- Yeah.

488
00:50:15,555 --> 00:50:17,724
Yeah?

489
00:50:17,933 --> 00:50:19,601
Great.

490
00:50:19,809 --> 00:50:21,811
- See ya.
- See ya.

491
00:50:22,646 --> 00:50:24,606
See ya.

492
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:28,271
- See you next week.
- Right. Thank you.

493
00:52:28,813 --> 00:52:31,191
Benny, would you
come inside a moment?

494
00:52:32,150 --> 00:52:34,110
Sure.

495
00:52:39,324 --> 00:52:42,577
- Who's the new housekeeper?
- The new...

496
00:52:42,786 --> 00:52:44,746
Oh! This...

497
00:52:44,871 --> 00:52:48,291
friend just came to stay
with us for a while, but...

498
00:52:48,416 --> 00:52:50,502
Joon tells me he's a man.

499
00:52:52,045 --> 00:52:55,382
Well, you know Joon,
how flowery she gets with words.

500
00:52:56,633 --> 00:52:59,344
So she's lying?
I mean, is it a man or isn't it?

501
00:52:59,469 --> 00:53:02,889
Well... Yes, technically.

502
00:53:03,932 --> 00:53:06,142
He's really just a guy, a friend.

503
00:53:06,351 --> 00:53:11,773
Where does this leave the group home?
I take it you haven't talked to her about it.

504
00:53:11,981 --> 00:53:14,150
No, not yet.

505
00:53:15,110 --> 00:53:17,821
The admission date
is less than a week away.

506
00:53:17,904 --> 00:53:21,866
But the thing is, she's really doin' fine.
She seems content.

507
00:53:21,991 --> 00:53:24,369
Let's just leave it at that for now.

508
00:53:25,537 --> 00:53:27,914
Let me know when you want to
tell her about it.

509
00:53:28,039 --> 00:53:29,999
I'll let you know.

510
00:53:30,125 --> 00:53:32,085
OK. Bye.

511
00:53:45,557 --> 00:53:47,642
- Hello.
- I want to help.

512
00:53:49,310 --> 00:53:51,187
Wonderful. OK.

513
00:53:51,271 --> 00:53:55,442
If you'd like to fill out this application,
I'll be right with you.

514
00:54:37,692 --> 00:54:39,861
Not so hard.

515
00:54:39,986 --> 00:54:42,697
Wow. You actually have cuticles.

516
00:54:42,906 --> 00:54:45,408
I know. That's amazing.

517
00:54:46,242 --> 00:54:48,620
What the hell is he doin'?

518
00:54:48,745 --> 00:54:50,830
Mashed potatoes.

519
00:54:52,290 --> 00:54:55,084
So are you and Ruthie
considering itemhood?

520
00:54:57,504 --> 00:54:59,464
Are you?

521
00:55:03,134 --> 00:55:05,929
# Benjamin and Ruthjamin, sittin' in a tree

522
00:55:06,679 --> 00:55:09,182
# K-i-s-s-i-n-g

523
00:55:09,807 --> 00:55:11,893
# First comes love, then comes marriage

524
00:55:11,976 --> 00:55:15,313
- Get outta here!
- # Then comes a little baby carriage

525
00:55:15,438 --> 00:55:17,815
I'm just takin' her out to dinner.

526
00:55:45,677 --> 00:55:48,054
- That's a good joke.
- Did you like that?

527
00:55:56,604 --> 00:55:58,690
- What time you got?
- It's eleven.

528
00:56:02,569 --> 00:56:04,529
- On the nose?
- Right exactly.

529
00:56:09,951 --> 00:56:14,747
I don't think I've asked anybody the time
before and had it been right on the nose.

530
00:56:14,872 --> 00:56:18,084
That's weird, isn't it?
It's right on the nose.

531
00:56:40,607 --> 00:56:43,318
Do you... Do you want
to come in for a while?

532
00:56:46,237 --> 00:56:48,239
I...

533
00:56:50,617 --> 00:56:52,910
I've got that beer waiting for you.

534
00:56:56,372 --> 00:56:58,333
You know what?

535
00:57:02,420 --> 00:57:04,797
I should probably go.

536
00:57:04,922 --> 00:57:07,300
- OK.
- Listen.

537
00:57:08,885 --> 00:57:11,679
Can l... Can I tell you somethin'?

538
00:57:11,804 --> 00:57:13,765
What?

539
00:57:17,018 --> 00:57:19,103
You see,

540
00:57:19,187 --> 00:57:24,609
my life is just real... complicated, and...

541
00:57:24,817 --> 00:57:28,071
Gimme a break, Benny.
I just offered you a beer, OK?

542
00:57:40,375 --> 00:57:42,335
No.

543
00:57:44,837 --> 00:57:47,465
Why don't we pick up Ruthie
and get some ice cream?

544
00:57:47,674 --> 00:57:49,634
- Yeah, let's get her.
- No.

545
00:57:49,759 --> 00:57:52,553
- Why?
- Because she doesn't want to talk to me.

546
00:58:18,121 --> 00:58:20,206
Come on. We should go.

547
00:58:22,291 --> 00:58:24,377
Knock it off.

548
01:01:11,836 --> 01:01:13,796
He is... He's incredible.

549
01:01:15,256 --> 01:01:17,258
He's amazing.

550
01:01:29,145 --> 01:01:33,733
- Did you have to go to school for that?
- No, I got thrown out of school for that.

551
01:01:33,941 --> 01:01:35,902
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

552
01:01:37,361 --> 01:01:40,281
Hey, listen.
Why don't you guys go ahead?

553
01:01:40,406 --> 01:01:42,783
I'm just gonna hang out here for a while.

554
01:01:42,992 --> 01:01:44,994
- Really?
- Yeah. Go ahead.

555
01:01:45,202 --> 01:01:47,163
I'll see you at home, later.

556
01:01:48,205 --> 01:01:50,291
- All right?
- OK.

557
01:01:50,416 --> 01:01:52,585
- That was great.
- No, no, no.

558
01:01:52,710 --> 01:01:54,879
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

559
01:01:55,087 --> 01:01:57,089
Bye-bye.

560
01:03:29,682 --> 01:03:33,310
# When the road gets dark

561
01:03:36,022 --> 01:03:39,483
# And you can no longer see

562
01:03:41,652 --> 01:03:45,322
# Just let my love throw a spark

563
01:03:47,825 --> 01:03:51,454
# And have a little faith in me

564
01:03:54,081 --> 01:03:58,753
# And when the tears you cry

565
01:04:00,337 --> 01:04:05,426
# Are all you can believe

566
01:04:06,052 --> 01:04:11,265
# Just give these lovin' arms a try, baby

567
01:04:12,433 --> 01:04:16,270
# And have a little faith in me

568
01:04:17,104 --> 01:04:20,566
# And have a little faith in me

569
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:27,239
# And have a little faith in me

570
01:04:29,533 --> 01:04:33,370
# And have a little faith in me

571
01:04:35,998 --> 01:04:39,835
# And have a little faith in me

572
01:04:43,589 --> 01:04:46,634
# When your secret heart

573
01:04:49,637 --> 01:04:53,390
# Cannot speak so easily

574
01:04:55,810 --> 01:04:59,438
# Come here, darlin',
from a whisper start

575
01:05:02,066 --> 01:05:05,694
# To have a little faith in me

576
01:05:07,571 --> 01:05:11,242
# Have a little faith in me

577
01:05:13,536 --> 01:05:17,289
# Have a little faith in me

578
01:05:20,626 --> 01:05:22,920
Joon?

579
01:05:23,129 --> 01:05:25,089
What?

580
01:05:29,176 --> 01:05:31,137
I love you.

581
01:05:34,598 --> 01:05:36,559
Me, too.

582
01:05:46,777 --> 01:05:48,863
- Don't tell Benny.
- OK.

583
01:05:51,574 --> 01:05:55,327
# When the road gets dark

584
01:05:57,955 --> 01:06:01,709
# And you can no longer see

585
01:06:03,586 --> 01:06:07,339
# Just let my love throw a spark

586
01:06:09,842 --> 01:06:13,596
# And have a little faith in me

587
01:06:16,182 --> 01:06:20,269
Did you see the way you had everyone
in the palm of your hand, huh?

588
01:06:20,352 --> 01:06:23,189
You've got this gift
and you shouldn't ignore it.

589
01:06:23,397 --> 01:06:27,443
- You should be doin' something with it.
- Like what?

590
01:06:27,651 --> 01:06:32,448
I don't know. All I know is I looked at you
and I said "This guy is somethin' else."

591
01:06:32,656 --> 01:06:36,827
You're not some schmo like the rest of us,
who do what we do because we have to.

592
01:06:37,036 --> 01:06:39,330
You're blessed.

593
01:06:40,164 --> 01:06:42,374
- Benny?
- What?

594
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:46,545
- How sick is she?
- She's plenty sick.

595
01:06:46,754 --> 01:06:50,382
- Now, I've been doin' some thinkin'.
- Because it seems to me,

596
01:06:50,591 --> 01:06:54,261
except for bein' a little
mentally ill, she's pretty normal.

597
01:06:54,470 --> 01:06:57,473
Do you realise you could be
the next Buster Keaton?

598
01:07:42,434 --> 01:07:46,063
I'm tellin' you, Randy. Listen.
You've got to see this guy.

599
01:07:46,188 --> 01:07:48,148
- Tell him, Eric.
- He's funny.

600
01:07:48,357 --> 01:07:52,653
- He's amazing. Will you see him?
- Yeah, I'll see him. You never know.

601
01:07:52,861 --> 01:07:57,116
Most of these guys just work locally,
but the better ones I can book out of town.

602
01:07:57,241 --> 01:08:01,412
- You book 'em out of town?
- All over. Detroit, Boston, sometimes LA.

603
01:08:01,620 --> 01:08:04,957
Whoa! Really? Can you see him tonight?

604
01:08:05,040 --> 01:08:07,126
I'd love to see him tonight.

605
01:08:08,919 --> 01:08:11,839
- Hi.
- Is my car ready?

606
01:08:12,047 --> 01:08:14,008
How you doin'?

607
01:08:14,133 --> 01:08:16,218
Come on in. Come on in.

608
01:08:18,095 --> 01:08:22,141
Listen, I want to apologise for
the other night. That all came out wrong.

609
01:08:22,349 --> 01:08:24,643
- No. No, it's OK.
- No, I really...

610
01:08:24,768 --> 01:08:27,062
- How's my car?
- It's runnin' great.

611
01:08:27,271 --> 01:08:30,607
Your fuel pump was shot.
I threw in a new one. It's great.

612
01:08:30,816 --> 01:08:32,776
How much do I owe you?

613
01:08:33,944 --> 01:08:38,615
I'll tell you what. Give me $30 for the part.
I'm not gonna charge you for labour.

614
01:08:39,033 --> 01:08:41,118
OK?

615
01:08:41,535 --> 01:08:46,123
Listen, if you're not doin' anything later,
I just lined up this thing for Sam.

616
01:08:46,248 --> 01:08:49,376
- What thing?
- It's kinda like an audition.

617
01:08:49,585 --> 01:08:53,005
Maybe his chance to make a living
at all this crazy stuff he does.

618
01:08:53,130 --> 01:08:57,509
Who knows? Maybe he could travel,
play clubs. I don't know, you know.

619
01:08:57,593 --> 01:09:00,429
So if you're not doin' anything later and...

620
01:09:00,637 --> 01:09:04,266
I don't know, Benny.
I got food to deliver, apartments to rent...

621
01:09:04,475 --> 01:09:07,936
My life's pretty complicated
right now. You know?

622
01:09:10,230 --> 01:09:12,316
Thanks. Bye.

623
01:09:16,362 --> 01:09:19,490
We'll lay out the whole routine
right after dinner.

624
01:09:19,615 --> 01:09:23,660
You know what you could start with?
Remember the roll thing in the diner?

625
01:09:23,786 --> 01:09:26,163
Who died and made you Ed McMahon?

626
01:09:26,789 --> 01:09:30,751
What is your problem? This is his chance
to do somethin', be somebody.

627
01:09:30,876 --> 01:09:34,088
- He is somebody.
- Yeah, I know, but he wants to be more.

628
01:09:36,507 --> 01:09:38,592
You don't know what he wants.

629
01:09:39,426 --> 01:09:43,055
I know he doesn't want to be
a housekeeper for the rest of his life.

630
01:09:43,263 --> 01:09:47,643
If you're worried about a new Smail,
don't worry, we'll get a new Smail.

631
01:09:50,062 --> 01:09:52,022
He's not my Smail.

632
01:09:53,399 --> 01:09:55,359
Housekeeper, whatever.

633
01:10:05,702 --> 01:10:07,788
We have to tell him.

634
01:10:13,627 --> 01:10:15,712
What?

635
01:10:16,547 --> 01:10:18,632
Tell me what?

636
01:10:25,931 --> 01:10:28,016
Benny...

637
01:10:30,519 --> 01:10:33,230
Joon... and...

638
01:10:33,313 --> 01:10:35,399
and l...

639
01:10:36,024 --> 01:10:38,735
are... you know.

640
01:10:52,833 --> 01:10:54,710
Bullshit.

641
01:11:00,424 --> 01:11:02,426
You...

642
01:11:08,056 --> 01:11:10,017
- Don't!
- Get the fuck out.

643
01:11:14,813 --> 01:11:17,316
You can't throw him out. I won him.

644
01:11:17,524 --> 01:11:19,943
You just settle down. Just settle down.

645
01:11:20,027 --> 01:11:22,112
- I love him!
- Yeah?

646
01:11:22,237 --> 01:11:24,198
Well, you are crazy!

647
01:11:25,991 --> 01:11:28,494
I am not crazy.

648
01:11:29,745 --> 01:11:32,664
You see what we've come to? You see?

649
01:11:35,667 --> 01:11:37,753
I hate you!

650
01:11:39,129 --> 01:11:41,089
I hate you!

651
01:12:17,501 --> 01:12:19,461
Can I get you anything?

652
01:12:23,006 --> 01:12:25,425
Tapioca.

653
01:12:27,719 --> 01:12:29,680
OK.

654
01:12:29,805 --> 01:12:31,890
Anything on it?

655
01:12:33,850 --> 01:12:35,936
Raisins.

656
01:12:37,604 --> 01:12:39,606
OK.

657
01:13:49,551 --> 01:13:51,637
Hi.

658
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:33,053
- Hi. How you doin'?
- You're out late.

659
01:14:33,136 --> 01:14:35,222
Yeah.

660
01:14:36,390 --> 01:14:38,350
Listen.

661
01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:41,061
Do you have any tapioca?

662
01:14:42,312 --> 01:14:47,442
- Jeez, I've heard a lot of lines in my life...
- No, no, no, it's not for me. It's...

663
01:14:48,777 --> 01:14:51,488
It's for Joon.

664
01:14:54,741 --> 01:14:56,702
- Come on in.
- Yeah?

665
01:15:50,505 --> 01:15:52,591
Joon.

666
01:15:53,341 --> 01:15:55,302
OK?

667
01:15:55,510 --> 01:15:57,512
- Yeah.
- Good, good, good.

668
01:16:14,613 --> 01:16:16,573
I'm not. No, no, I'm not.

669
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:27,125
OK? All right?

670
01:16:32,964 --> 01:16:35,467
Hold tight. OK. Shh. It's OK.

671
01:16:37,969 --> 01:16:40,055
It's OK.

672
01:16:45,060 --> 01:16:48,063
I am not! I am not! I am not!

673
01:17:02,452 --> 01:17:04,746
Shut up!

674
01:17:04,871 --> 01:17:08,500
No, no. No, no.

675
01:17:20,512 --> 01:17:24,140
- Joon, please, come on.
- No, it's not all in my head.

676
01:17:33,733 --> 01:17:35,819
Sir? Sir!

677
01:17:36,570 --> 01:17:38,530
Stop the bus, please!

678
01:17:39,906 --> 01:17:41,867
Please stop the bus!

679
01:18:08,059 --> 01:18:10,020
No!

680
01:18:11,605 --> 01:18:13,565
Joon.

681
01:18:22,657 --> 01:18:26,494
- All righty. You wanna step out?
- Yeah, OK. Yeah, OK.

682
01:18:26,620 --> 01:18:30,040
- How you doin', hon?
- You think I don't know who you are?

683
01:18:30,248 --> 01:18:32,250
I know just who you are!

684
01:18:33,168 --> 01:18:35,462
So just leave. Leave.

685
01:18:35,670 --> 01:18:37,672
Leave!

686
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:49,225
Don't you touch me! Don't touch me!

687
01:19:06,451 --> 01:19:08,411
Joon? Joon!

688
01:19:37,107 --> 01:19:41,987
Look, I am going to see my sister. Would
you please just tell me her room number?

689
01:19:42,112 --> 01:19:46,992
- Please, just come back in the morning.
- Let me talk to her goddamn doctor!

690
01:19:48,660 --> 01:19:51,705
I'm sorry. She doesn't want any visitors.

691
01:19:51,788 --> 01:19:54,207
Not you or anyone else.

692
01:19:54,833 --> 01:19:56,918
She doesn't wanna see me?

693
01:19:57,002 --> 01:19:59,087
No. And she doesn't want to leave.

694
01:20:01,506 --> 01:20:05,343
Benny, why don't you go home?
Get some sleep.

695
01:20:06,511 --> 01:20:08,596
I promise I'll keep in touch.

696
01:20:29,659 --> 01:20:32,162
I hope you're happy.

697
01:20:32,370 --> 01:20:35,373
I hope you are happy with
what you have done to her.

698
01:20:36,750 --> 01:20:40,795
You just stay the hell away
from my sister.

699
01:20:43,631 --> 01:20:45,592
No.

700
01:20:47,594 --> 01:20:50,305
Wanna know why
everyone laughs at you, Sam?

701
01:20:51,222 --> 01:20:53,308
Because you're an idiot.

702
01:20:53,433 --> 01:20:56,227
You're a first-class moron.

703
01:21:05,528 --> 01:21:08,531
- You're scared, Benny.
- I'm what?

704
01:21:09,908 --> 01:21:12,077
You're scared.

705
01:21:12,285 --> 01:21:15,538
I can see it. And I know why.

706
01:21:18,750 --> 01:21:20,835
I used to look up to you.

707
01:21:21,795 --> 01:21:24,089
But...

708
01:21:24,297 --> 01:21:26,257
now I can't look at you at all.

709
01:21:55,161 --> 01:22:00,250
# Come down offyour throne
and leave your body alone

710
01:22:02,252 --> 01:22:04,629
# Somebody must change

711
01:22:07,132 --> 01:22:11,636
# You are the reason
I've been waitin' so long

712
01:22:13,721 --> 01:22:16,516
# Somebody holds the key

713
01:22:17,684 --> 01:22:24,858
# Well, I'm weary
and ljust ain't got the time

714
01:22:27,485 --> 01:22:33,950
# And I'm wasted
and I can't find my way home

715
01:22:46,671 --> 01:22:52,302
# Come down on your own
and leave your body alone

716
01:22:53,761 --> 01:22:56,472
# Somebody must change

717
01:22:58,641 --> 01:23:03,855
# You are the reason
I've been waitin' all these years

718
01:23:05,231 --> 01:23:07,734
# Somebody holds the key

719
01:23:08,985 --> 01:23:15,742
# Well, I'm weary
and ljust ain't got the time

720
01:23:17,952 --> 01:23:19,913
# Oh, no

721
01:23:20,038 --> 01:23:26,085
# Cos I'm wasted
and I can't find my way home

722
01:23:28,171 --> 01:23:31,299
- I think Fred Astaire is the way to go.
- Yeah?

723
01:23:31,507 --> 01:23:35,470
- That's a good choice.
- Who was that woman in Roman...

724
01:23:35,553 --> 01:23:38,264
- Audrey Hepburn.
- Yeah. Sam, thanks a lot.

725
01:23:39,307 --> 01:23:41,309
Have a nice day.

726
01:23:50,276 --> 01:23:53,696
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, I hope so.

727
01:23:58,826 --> 01:24:00,912
- Hi, Benny.
- Thomas.

728
01:24:02,455 --> 01:24:04,749
How is she? Tell me the truth.

729
01:24:04,874 --> 01:24:09,045
- She's been better, Benny.
- You gotta tell me what room she's in.

730
01:24:10,171 --> 01:24:14,884
335. But don't even think about it, Benny.
It's a closed ward. No visitors.

731
01:24:15,301 --> 01:24:20,515
- No, we've gotta find Joon. Please.
- Thomas, get us in there to see her.

732
01:24:21,349 --> 01:24:25,603
- It's impossible, Benny.
- What do you mean, it's impossible?

733
01:24:25,728 --> 01:24:28,314
Listen, I just need two minutes with her.

734
01:24:28,439 --> 01:24:30,525
Benny, I'll get fired!

735
01:24:30,608 --> 01:24:32,694
Thomas,

736
01:24:32,819 --> 01:24:34,988
I'm beggin' you, as a friend.

737
01:24:35,530 --> 01:24:39,909
I'd love to help you out, but Garvey's
gonna be in there to check on her soon.

738
01:24:40,118 --> 01:24:42,704
My hands are tied. My hands are tied!

739
01:24:51,462 --> 01:24:54,173
What room did he say?

740
01:24:54,299 --> 01:24:56,050
335.

741
01:26:51,290 --> 01:26:53,251
Shit.

742
01:26:57,130 --> 01:26:59,090
What are you doin'?

743
01:27:02,844 --> 01:27:03,803
Mommy?

744
01:27:04,011 --> 01:27:08,266
- What are you doin' here?
- I don't think you're supposed to be here.

745
01:27:09,016 --> 01:27:11,811
- Get the door.
- How'd he get past Security?

746
01:27:12,019 --> 01:27:14,021
Hey, watch the door.

747
01:27:41,215 --> 01:27:43,217
Joon.

748
01:27:45,386 --> 01:27:47,889
Look, I know you want to be left alone.

749
01:27:48,014 --> 01:27:51,434
But you do not belong in here.

750
01:27:52,602 --> 01:27:54,562
Now,

751
01:27:55,313 --> 01:27:58,941
how would you like to try
livin' in your own apartment?

752
01:28:04,071 --> 01:28:07,074
- An apartment?
- Yeah.

753
01:28:07,825 --> 01:28:11,162
There's an apartment
available in Ruthie's building.

754
01:28:12,705 --> 01:28:14,790
You'd let me live in an apartment?

755
01:28:15,541 --> 01:28:17,919
That's up to you.

756
01:28:19,295 --> 01:28:22,298
I'm through makin'
those decisions for you.

757
01:28:28,971 --> 01:28:30,973
Listen, l...

758
01:28:32,850 --> 01:28:35,853
I'm sorry I was such a jerk.

759
01:28:36,479 --> 01:28:40,233
And about Sam, I was wrong.
I was dead wrong.

760
01:28:41,901 --> 01:28:45,154
- I scared him away.
- No, you didn't.

761
01:28:45,238 --> 01:28:47,323
He's here.

762
01:28:47,448 --> 01:28:49,951
- He is not.
- He's here. He got me in here!

763
01:28:50,034 --> 01:28:52,870
- He's somewhere in the building.
- He is not.

764
01:28:54,121 --> 01:28:56,207
You'd never let me have him.

765
01:28:58,292 --> 01:29:00,253
God.

766
01:29:02,255 --> 01:29:04,840
Why do you hate me so much?

767
01:29:06,926 --> 01:29:09,011
I don't hate you.

768
01:29:09,971 --> 01:29:12,056
You need me to be sick.

769
01:29:20,398 --> 01:29:22,358
Juniper Pearl's chart, please.

770
01:29:26,445 --> 01:29:27,363
Thank you.

771
01:29:31,659 --> 01:29:33,619
Hey, wait! Wally! Wait! Wait!

772
01:29:33,744 --> 01:29:36,956
Put him down! He's mine.
I've been lookin' for him.

773
01:29:37,081 --> 01:29:39,792
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. I'll take care of him.

774
01:29:41,043 --> 01:29:44,672
- Sam, you can't be in here.
- Where's Joon's room?

775
01:29:44,797 --> 01:29:47,800
- I've gotta see her.
- Come on, come on.

776
01:30:02,189 --> 01:30:04,817
Give me a reason why
I shouldn't have you arrested.

777
01:30:07,194 --> 01:30:09,196
- It's that one.
- Yeah.

778
01:30:09,405 --> 01:30:11,991
See? Sam, where you goin'?

779
01:30:13,367 --> 01:30:16,787
Benny, this is exactly
what we were trying to avoid.

780
01:30:17,330 --> 01:30:21,083
By now, Joon would be in a caring
and controlled environment.

781
01:30:21,292 --> 01:30:24,211
Isn't it obvious now that
you two need some distance?

782
01:30:24,295 --> 01:30:26,589
Why don't we ask Joon what she wants?

783
01:30:29,717 --> 01:30:31,719
Sam, what are you doin'?

784
01:30:35,139 --> 01:30:37,642
Hey, Sam, come on! Get down, right now!

785
01:30:38,476 --> 01:30:40,561
I don't know exactly what I want.

786
01:30:42,772 --> 01:30:47,985
I do know... that I am tired of
everyone telling me what to do.

787
01:30:51,113 --> 01:30:53,074
Sam, come on!

788
01:30:53,199 --> 01:30:55,284
Don't touch that!

789
01:30:55,368 --> 01:30:57,453
Sam, leave that! I'm beggin' you!

790
01:30:58,204 --> 01:31:00,581
Joon, we want what's best for you.

791
01:31:01,832 --> 01:31:03,918
I know that.

792
01:31:13,219 --> 01:31:14,887
I...

793
01:31:15,596 --> 01:31:17,682
Sam, come down now!

794
01:31:19,892 --> 01:31:21,852
You're gonna get in trouble!

795
01:31:21,977 --> 01:31:24,980
I think I want to try
living in my own apartment.

796
01:31:39,912 --> 01:31:42,498
Hm. I don't know.

797
01:31:43,749 --> 01:31:45,835
Sam, stop swinging!

798
01:31:50,131 --> 01:31:52,299
But I'm willing to let you try.

799
01:31:55,010 --> 01:31:57,513
I'll prepare the papers for her release.

800
01:31:59,098 --> 01:32:01,058
Thank you, Dr Garvey.

801
01:32:04,186 --> 01:32:06,397
Come down! Sam!

802
01:32:09,316 --> 01:32:11,402
Whoa! Whoa!

803
01:32:12,653 --> 01:32:14,739
- Are you OK?
- Ouch! Ouch!

804
01:32:34,133 --> 01:32:36,218
I know.

805
01:32:37,136 --> 01:32:39,221
Me, too.

806
01:32:41,223 --> 01:32:43,184
I'm gonna check you out, OK?

807
01:32:48,939 --> 01:32:51,025
OK.

808
01:34:20,406 --> 01:34:22,491
Haven't we tried this before?

809
01:34:23,534 --> 01:34:26,537
Yeah, but my life's
a lot less complicated now.

810
01:34:29,915 --> 01:34:32,418
- Is Joon inside?
- Yeah.

811
01:34:32,543 --> 01:34:34,628
OK.

812
01:34:58,736 --> 01:35:02,072
# When I wake up,
well, I know I'm gonna be

813
01:35:02,156 --> 01:35:04,992
# I'm gonna be the man
who wakes up next to you

814
01:35:06,035 --> 01:35:09,371
# When I go out,
yeah, I know I'm gonna be

815
01:35:09,622 --> 01:35:12,333
# I'm gonna be the man
who goes along with you

816
01:35:13,250 --> 01:35:16,712
# lfl get drunk,
well, I know I'm gonna be

817
01:35:16,837 --> 01:35:20,382
# I'm gonna be the man
who gets drunk next to you

818
01:35:20,591 --> 01:35:24,053
# And ifl haver,
yeah, I know I'm gonna be

819
01:35:24,136 --> 01:35:26,847
# I'm gonna be the man
who's haverin' to you

820
01:35:28,265 --> 01:35:31,477
# But I would walk five hundred miles

821
01:35:31,602 --> 01:35:35,147
# And I would walk five hundred more

822
01:35:35,397 --> 01:35:39,568
# Just to be the man
who walked a thousand miles

823
01:35:39,652 --> 01:35:42,571
# To fall down at your door

824
01:35:50,120 --> 01:35:53,457
# And I would walk five hundred miles

825
01:35:53,624 --> 01:35:57,044
# And I would walk five hundred more

826
01:35:57,252 --> 01:36:01,632
# Just to be the man
who walked a thousand miles

827
01:36:01,799 --> 01:36:05,970
# To fall down at your door.
