1
00:00:43,109 --> 00:00:46,636
There is not one universe. 
There are many.

2
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:48,807
A Multiverse.

3
00:00:49,149 --> 00:00:52,516
We have the technology
to travel between universes...

4
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:56,814
...but travel is highly restricted
and policed.

5
00:00:57,657 --> 00:01:01,093
There is not one you. There are many.

6
00:01:01,161 --> 00:01:05,825
Each of us exists in present time,
in parallel universes.

7
00:01:07,133 --> 00:01:09,431
There was balance in the system...

8
00:01:09,502 --> 00:01:13,768
...but now a force exists
who seeks to destroy the balance...

9
00:01:13,873 --> 00:01:16,774
...so he can become The One.

10
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:18,469
President Gore addressed Congress today
where he outlined the White House plan...

11
00:02:26,112 --> 00:02:29,047
Here they come, man.
They're going to take you on out.

12
00:02:29,182 --> 00:02:32,674
You're dead, Lawless! You're dead!
Ain't payback a bitch?

13
00:02:33,186 --> 00:02:35,450
Die, Lawless, you piece of shit!

14
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:38,550
Die like all my boys you took out!

15
00:03:02,115 --> 00:03:04,379
I know they're going to kill you upstate...

16
00:03:04,717 --> 00:03:08,619
...but no one's getting you on my watch,
so don't sweat, Lawless.

17
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:10,622
You want that thumb?

18
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:16,789
Let's move him out of here.

19
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:24,267
I want to hear you scream, Lawless.
Come on, scream for me.

20
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,071
Going to get you, asshole!

21
00:03:39,185 --> 00:03:40,880
Yeah, walk the walk!

22
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:48,693
You piece of shit! You're a dead man!

23
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:19,748
Something's wrong.

24
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:24,628
Prisoner down!

25
00:04:25,698 --> 00:04:26,824
Up there!

26
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:40,145
Hold your fire! Cease fire!

27
00:04:51,257 --> 00:04:53,555
Woo, Scott, follow me!

28
00:05:06,272 --> 00:05:10,072
Razor wire should have kept anyone out,
let alone moving fast.

29
00:05:11,577 --> 00:05:13,067
There's no blood.

30
00:06:54,013 --> 00:06:56,777
Holy shit! He's doing 50!

31
00:07:33,719 --> 00:07:36,688
Adam 13 in pursuit of suspect
headed west, Third and Olympic.

32
00:07:36,756 --> 00:07:39,884
Request assistance
from 2 David air unit. Over.

33
00:07:40,059 --> 00:07:43,222
Roger that.
Air 14 en route to Third and Olympic.

34
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:47,992
He's going to the hole.

35
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,494
We have to get there,
override him before he jumps.

36
00:08:50,563 --> 00:08:52,895
Give me the go-ahead. He'll never make it.

37
00:08:52,965 --> 00:08:55,195
Check fire. Stick to procedure, Funsch.

38
00:08:55,434 --> 00:08:59,200
You were recruited to apprehend him,
not be his assassin, understand?

39
00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:02,498
I can't hear you. Do you understand?

40
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:04,300
Loud and clear.

41
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:07,236
Yulaw! MVA!

42
00:09:13,185 --> 00:09:15,312
Loud and clear, huh?

43
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:47,815
Roedecker! Less than a minute!

44
00:09:52,491 --> 00:09:53,617
Shit!

45
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:58,328
Hands high!

46
00:09:58,531 --> 00:10:00,396
Thirty seconds, Roedecker.

47
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:03,598
Who the hell is this now?

48
00:10:05,304 --> 00:10:08,364
You must be the new guy.
Where is Roedecker?

49
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:10,174
This is your last warning.

50
00:10:10,576 --> 00:10:12,874
Get your hands where I can see them.

51
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:14,511
Freeze!

52
00:10:15,047 --> 00:10:17,015
You, drop that weapon!

53
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:26,755
I will kill you.

54
00:10:27,426 --> 00:10:28,950
No, you won't.

55
00:10:29,662 --> 00:10:30,856
Where is Roedecker?

56
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:38,501
- Here I am.
- What the...

57
00:11:49,008 --> 00:11:49,940
Funsch.

58
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,905
You stick to procedure...

59
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:55,878
...it all works out.

60
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:05,188
Victim 117, Yu Fook Law,
Monoceros Universe.

61
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:10,260
Victim 118, Swen Law, Tucana Universe.

62
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:15,157
Victim 119, Ni Dilaw, Canopus Universe.

63
00:12:15,668 --> 00:12:20,332
Victim 120, Kia Jilaw, Serpenz Universe.

64
00:12:20,873 --> 00:12:25,310
Victim 121, Seth Law, Procyon Universe.

65
00:12:25,778 --> 00:12:30,545
Victim 122, Frun Law, Shauwla Universe.

66
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:35,547
Victim 123, Lawless, Anubis Universe.

67
00:13:07,753 --> 00:13:09,983
What's the next move?

68
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:12,924
It won't work for you anymore, Yulaw.

69
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:21,524
The shortest distance
between two points...

70
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:25,369
...will always be a straight line.

71
00:13:26,705 --> 00:13:30,539
Your line has run out. You don't see that?

72
00:13:32,678 --> 00:13:36,444
There's never been anything
like what I have become.

73
00:13:36,882 --> 00:13:40,283
You know that.
You were there for my first one.

74
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:44,456
- I wish I'd never let there be a second.
- But there was a second.

75
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:46,247
And a third.

76
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:48,892
And a 123rd.

77
00:13:50,429 --> 00:13:52,192
Why did you come, Harry?

78
00:13:53,032 --> 00:13:54,590
You miss me?

79
00:13:57,203 --> 00:13:58,568
I missed who you were.

80
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:03,039
You've been chasing me how many years?

81
00:14:03,275 --> 00:14:04,435
Two years.

82
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:08,609
I just need to do it one more time.

83
00:14:09,081 --> 00:14:12,983
There won't be a "one more time" for you.

84
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:23,715
Destination:
Stygian Penal Colony, Hades Universe.

85
00:15:39,171 --> 00:15:41,162
Gabriel Yulaw.

86
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:45,941
The peoples of the Multiverse
have found you guilty...

87
00:15:46,178 --> 00:15:48,908
...of 123 counts of first-degree murder...

88
00:15:49,381 --> 00:15:54,148
...and 123 counts of unauthorized travel
to parallel universes...

89
00:15:54,219 --> 00:15:56,983
...by use of illegal quantum tunneling.

90
00:15:58,023 --> 00:16:00,719
For these crimes,
you have been sentenced to life...

91
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:03,421
...without the possibility of return...

92
00:16:03,595 --> 00:16:07,759
...on the Stygian Penal Colony,
in the Hades Universe.

93
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:10,191
May God be with you.

94
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:17,999
You may make a final statement.

95
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,846
The Multiverse.

96
00:16:24,883 --> 00:16:28,319
Every universe in it is irrational...

97
00:16:28,854 --> 00:16:30,253
...sloppy.

98
00:16:30,456 --> 00:16:35,120
I just try to make it rational.
I just try to make it neat.

99
00:16:36,795 --> 00:16:38,820
You call it murder.

100
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:43,726
How could I murder myself 123 times?

101
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:47,768
I just took those wasted energies...

102
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:51,941
...and put them into one container: me.

103
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:57,540
It made me faster, smarter, stronger.

104
00:16:58,617 --> 00:17:02,417
What if that is our fate?

105
00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:06,183
To unite with our other selves.

106
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:09,721
To be unified forever.

107
00:17:10,062 --> 00:17:11,723
To be one.

108
00:17:12,898 --> 00:17:16,459
I will be The One.

109
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,700
Gabriel Yulaw...

110
00:17:26,645 --> 00:17:27,805
...are you ready?

111
00:17:28,814 --> 00:17:29,803
Are you?

112
00:18:05,651 --> 00:18:08,484
Wormhole opens in five...

113
00:18:08,554 --> 00:18:12,422
...four, three, two, one.

114
00:18:35,214 --> 00:18:36,476
Wormhole's shut.

115
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:39,675
It only had a 30-second window.
Now we have to wait.

116
00:18:40,586 --> 00:18:42,247
Son of a bitch!

117
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:45,984
- Permission to speak, sir?
- Speak.

118
00:18:46,358 --> 00:18:48,053
Is this part of the procedure?

119
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:54,026
We'll get him on the other side.

120
00:18:54,533 --> 00:18:56,763
There's only one place he could be going.

121
00:19:19,758 --> 00:19:21,783
Aldrich, take these.

122
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:39,868
President Bush addressed a joint session
of Congress today...

123
00:19:39,945 --> 00:19:43,574
...where he outlined the White House plan
for universal health care.

124
00:19:49,154 --> 00:19:52,419
Ronnie, you're dead! You rat!

125
00:19:52,491 --> 00:19:55,153
Die, you piece of shit snitch!

126
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:18,316
You're going to be okay, Ronnie.
You're doing the right thing.

127
00:20:40,772 --> 00:20:42,296
- Go, go!
- Dead! Dead!

128
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:44,035
You snitch! Dead!

129
00:21:07,399 --> 00:21:08,730
Something's wrong.

130
00:21:09,368 --> 00:21:11,768
Go, go, go! Get him out! Get him out!

131
00:21:12,304 --> 00:21:14,033
Get him in the vehicle.

132
00:21:17,042 --> 00:21:19,704
Get out, now. Go, go, go.

133
00:21:20,145 --> 00:21:21,134
Oh, shit!

134
00:21:33,425 --> 00:21:34,949
Cease fire!

135
00:21:50,709 --> 00:21:52,233
Is he soup yet?

136
00:21:52,878 --> 00:21:55,369
- No way he got out of there.
- He's got to be.

137
00:22:08,293 --> 00:22:09,590
No!

138
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:14,857
Get him down! Pull!

139
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:19,462
One Henry Robert! Code 3!

140
00:22:19,538 --> 00:22:21,938
Demand immediate backup
in the delivery area!

141
00:22:28,814 --> 00:22:29,746
Go!

142
00:22:44,129 --> 00:22:45,619
I need a hand over here!

143
00:23:10,822 --> 00:23:12,790
Hey, on the bus!

144
00:23:17,996 --> 00:23:19,486
He's going OJ!

145
00:23:19,931 --> 00:23:21,455
- Get him!
- Let's go, Yates!

146
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:53,890
Gabe!

147
00:24:02,808 --> 00:24:04,002
Gabe!

148
00:24:04,676 --> 00:24:05,973
You see that?

149
00:24:09,414 --> 00:24:12,076
The good news is you're not crazy.

150
00:24:13,685 --> 00:24:15,380
The bad news...

151
00:24:36,741 --> 00:24:38,936
I lived here my whole life.

152
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:41,840
And everywhere I look for great memories.

153
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:46,576
Now all I see is Larry and those kids.

154
00:24:59,264 --> 00:25:00,356
Gabe.

155
00:25:01,032 --> 00:25:02,158
Oh, my God!

156
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:03,665
I'm okay.

157
00:25:04,736 --> 00:25:07,398
- I'm okay.
- Aldrich said you were in the hospital.

158
00:25:07,472 --> 00:25:10,100
- Yeah, I was.
- Did they check you out?

159
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:13,804
I checked myself. Nothing to check. See?

160
00:25:15,447 --> 00:25:19,076
I just need to get myself clear. Hey, Ollie.

161
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:21,675
You were shot. You need to be examined.

162
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:22,911
You can do it.

163
00:25:22,988 --> 00:25:26,014
Newsflash. I'm a vet.
You don't have paws and a tail.

164
00:25:26,424 --> 00:25:30,053
With all that's been happening to you,
you need to see someone.

165
00:25:30,262 --> 00:25:32,753
I'm seeing the only person I need to see.

166
00:25:32,964 --> 00:25:33,988
I'm serious.

167
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:43,398
We'll go to the hospital,
check on Woo, after I'm done.

168
00:26:46,972 --> 00:26:48,837
You'll be all right, man.

169
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:51,340
- You guys take care of him now.
- Yes, sir.

170
00:26:53,478 --> 00:26:55,946
Gabe? Hey, T.K.

171
00:26:56,348 --> 00:26:57,372
How is he?

172
00:26:57,949 --> 00:27:00,782
External injuries mostly.
EMT said he's seen a lot worse.

173
00:27:01,052 --> 00:27:04,112
You gave us a bigger scare
just leaving the hospital like that.

174
00:27:05,156 --> 00:27:08,785
Your man went deep tonight, T.K.
Don't know how he made it up that wall.

175
00:27:09,427 --> 00:27:13,090
I wouldn't be here if you guys
didn't make it up right behind me.

176
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:17,028
We never made it up that wall.

177
00:27:17,335 --> 00:27:20,498
I didn't make it out
of the goddamn parking lot.

178
00:27:20,705 --> 00:27:24,004
Backup unit reported you down.
We continued pursuit, unsuccessful.

179
00:27:24,175 --> 00:27:27,406
Only you got a good look at the suspect.
We need a description.

180
00:27:29,848 --> 00:27:33,909
Think it's someone out of Ronnie's posse?
Payback for snitching?

181
00:27:34,085 --> 00:27:35,518
It was dark.

182
00:27:35,587 --> 00:27:37,714
You have anything? Anything to go on?

183
00:27:37,922 --> 00:27:39,082
Sorry.

184
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:43,158
If you remember anything,
we'll be down the hall.

185
00:27:44,796 --> 00:27:47,594
Hey, man, I'm glad you're still with us.

186
00:27:47,866 --> 00:27:49,163
Thanks.

187
00:27:52,237 --> 00:27:54,068
Why did you lie to them?

188
00:27:54,606 --> 00:27:55,937
It was dark.

189
00:27:56,141 --> 00:27:59,702
Gabe, it's not the guys. It's me.

190
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:08,178
It was me.

191
00:28:09,621 --> 00:28:10,815
What?

192
00:28:11,556 --> 00:28:15,048
He wasn't trying to hit Ronnie.
He was aiming at me!

193
00:28:16,961 --> 00:28:20,124
Before I saw him, I felt him.

194
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:22,423
I felt me!

195
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:24,968
It was me.

196
00:28:27,439 --> 00:28:30,931
Maybe the adrenaline
caused some kind of hallucination.

197
00:28:31,342 --> 00:28:34,709
You were shot. Your memory
could've been affected by the trauma.

198
00:28:35,814 --> 00:28:39,375
Or maybe it's part
of what's been happening to you.

199
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:43,486
People get older. They don't get stronger.

200
00:28:43,822 --> 00:28:45,813
They don't get faster all of a sudden.

201
00:28:49,627 --> 00:28:54,030
Whatever it is, we're here now, right?

202
00:28:58,036 --> 00:29:00,800
And if they find something wrong with me?

203
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:04,166
I don't want to lose my job.

204
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:08,140
I don't want to lose you.

205
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:15,644
Mrs. Law,
before we go into the MRI room...

206
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:18,484
...I have some questions to ask you
about your husband.

207
00:29:18,556 --> 00:29:21,024
- Does he have a cardiac pacemaker?
- No.

208
00:29:21,226 --> 00:29:23,421
- Intracranial aneurysm clip?
- No.

209
00:29:23,495 --> 00:29:26,828
Dentures, hearing aid or penile implant?

210
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:30,833
No, no, and not unless he had one put in
since this morning.

211
00:30:02,667 --> 00:30:06,535
Mr. Law. Right this way.
I have a few forms for you to fill out.

212
00:30:06,604 --> 00:30:10,404
This is a painless procedure
so there's nothing for you to worry about.

213
00:30:10,708 --> 00:30:13,142
Dressing room's here.
Remove all your clothing.

214
00:30:13,211 --> 00:30:14,803
You'll find a gown on a hook.

215
00:30:14,879 --> 00:30:19,578
The paperwork's already started
so we'll get you in and out in no time.

216
00:30:19,717 --> 00:30:22,151
Please remove
all personal metallic objects.

217
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:25,380
That means no keys, no watches,
no credit cards...

218
00:30:25,456 --> 00:30:27,981
...no body piercings, no cell phones...

219
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:35,962
My gun.

220
00:30:36,034 --> 00:30:38,969
- No guns, no jewelry, no zippers.
- What?

221
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:40,594
The hospital has it.

222
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:43,933
You're going in for an MRI. Gabe?

223
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:46,871
Remember what I said?

224
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:48,668
I feel it again.

225
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:51,982
When you're done,
we'll go get your things, all right?

226
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:53,984
They're not giving her your gun.

227
00:30:54,252 --> 00:30:56,550
The guys are downstairs.
They can get the gun.

228
00:30:56,621 --> 00:31:01,183
Even if you did, you're not bringing it here.
That's a powerful, precise magnet.

229
00:31:04,295 --> 00:31:05,284
All right.

230
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:09,027
If you start the MRI, I'll find the guys.

231
00:31:09,634 --> 00:31:11,192
Lose the wedding ring.

232
00:31:15,406 --> 00:31:16,566
Here. I got it.

233
00:31:39,631 --> 00:31:44,398
For Christ's sake, you're getting an MRI,
not a heart transplant.

234
00:31:56,614 --> 00:32:00,550
Mr. Law, I need you to remain still
for three to ten minutes.

235
00:32:00,618 --> 00:32:05,385
You can talk, but if you move,
we have to start all over.

236
00:32:35,887 --> 00:32:37,752
Hey. Where did you guys go?

237
00:32:38,056 --> 00:32:39,785
I took him in for a...

238
00:32:39,891 --> 00:32:42,291
Something wrong?
Can I get you something?

239
00:32:46,998 --> 00:32:49,364
No, I have to talk to the doctor.

240
00:33:03,214 --> 00:33:06,047
Mike, I can't take my break
till I'm done with this guy.

241
00:33:06,284 --> 00:33:08,377
Can you wait half an hour?

242
00:33:11,622 --> 00:33:13,556
Mr. Law, what are you doing?

243
00:33:13,624 --> 00:33:15,592
Now we have to start over.

244
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,655
Why? What did I do?

245
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:22,159
Back away!

246
00:33:25,069 --> 00:33:26,730
Thought you were gonna kill me.

247
00:33:26,804 --> 00:33:28,863
Just give me the chance, asshole.

248
00:33:31,776 --> 00:33:33,437
Get on your knees slowly.

249
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:34,500
You there?

250
00:33:37,248 --> 00:33:39,113
On the floor, right now!

251
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:40,745
The floor?

252
00:33:40,918 --> 00:33:42,510
This is a hospital.

253
00:33:42,954 --> 00:33:46,185
The floor is full of germs.
You want me to get sick?

254
00:33:56,601 --> 00:33:58,034
It's gunfire.

255
00:33:58,469 --> 00:34:00,300
Let's get security.

256
00:34:00,505 --> 00:34:01,597
Gabe.

257
00:34:11,349 --> 00:34:12,611
Get back!

258
00:34:26,297 --> 00:34:27,423
What have you got?

259
00:34:28,266 --> 00:34:29,028
Nothing.

260
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,567
Not a thing.

261
00:34:44,215 --> 00:34:46,046
No! No!

262
00:34:48,152 --> 00:34:49,141
Be still.

263
00:35:03,067 --> 00:35:05,228
Unit 15, weapon fire, south tower!

264
00:35:05,303 --> 00:35:07,430
Fourth floor, Imaging Radiology!

265
00:35:07,505 --> 00:35:08,972
Gabe is there.

266
00:35:09,974 --> 00:35:13,171
- Hands high! Hands high, Yulaw!
- Don't move! Don't move!

267
00:35:13,244 --> 00:35:14,233
Don't move!

268
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:24,020
We all know if you kill me,
you have to kill the other guy.

269
00:35:26,324 --> 00:35:28,690
- Just let me take out one leg.
- Cuff him.

270
00:35:29,527 --> 00:35:30,619
I'll cover you.

271
00:35:31,929 --> 00:35:33,123
Go.

272
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:36,459
Back, get back!

273
00:35:53,851 --> 00:35:55,512
- It's Gabe.
- Go! Channel 7.

274
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:57,847
Swing the camera. Follow him.

275
00:35:59,223 --> 00:36:01,123
He cut right at the end of the hall.

276
00:36:03,427 --> 00:36:04,860
Don't move! Stay here!

277
00:36:05,096 --> 00:36:06,688
Go back to the room.

278
00:36:27,118 --> 00:36:29,416
T.K., you can't go up there!

279
00:36:44,936 --> 00:36:46,335
Which one is he?

280
00:36:49,173 --> 00:36:52,904
- I'm okay. I'm all right.
- Don't move, Gabe! We're here to help.

281
00:36:53,277 --> 00:36:55,609
- I'm all right.
- Do you know where you are?

282
00:36:56,847 --> 00:36:59,315
- What's wrong with you?
- Where are you, Gabe?

283
00:37:00,418 --> 00:37:03,285
There are three armed men.
They killed a security officer.

284
00:37:03,354 --> 00:37:05,219
- Who are we?
- They went down the hall.

285
00:37:05,289 --> 00:37:08,258
- What's my name?
- I was unarmed. I couldn't go after them.

286
00:37:08,426 --> 00:37:10,087
What did you do with the gun?

287
00:37:11,262 --> 00:37:14,026
I don't have one. I asked T.K. to get it.

288
00:37:14,298 --> 00:37:15,925
Yulaw wouldn't have known that.

289
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,867
This one's safer in their custody.
Let them take him.

290
00:37:18,936 --> 00:37:20,961
You need help before you hurt yourself.

291
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:22,164
Or anyone else.

292
00:37:22,473 --> 00:37:25,533
Anyone else? Someone tried to kill me!

293
00:37:27,111 --> 00:37:29,136
Please! I don't want to hurt you guys.

294
00:37:34,452 --> 00:37:35,749
Let go of me!

295
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,444
I don't want to hurt you.

296
00:37:39,624 --> 00:37:42,491
I don't want to hurt you guys.

297
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:02,078
Settle back down!

298
00:38:10,655 --> 00:38:13,123
He's close to Yulaw's strength.

299
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:15,892
Let go! Gabe!

300
00:38:17,495 --> 00:38:19,986
It's what I told you. It's me.

301
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:24,157
Get home.

302
00:38:27,204 --> 00:38:29,434
We have a problem here.

303
00:38:30,207 --> 00:38:33,040
Yeah, the real problem is
procedure sucks...

304
00:38:33,944 --> 00:38:35,002
...sir.

305
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:42,650
All right, new procedure.

306
00:38:43,054 --> 00:38:46,319
Gabe is yours. I will take Yulaw.

307
00:38:46,891 --> 00:38:48,518
How you going to do that?

308
00:38:48,893 --> 00:38:50,793
I'll do whatever it takes.

309
00:38:52,296 --> 00:38:54,321
Sync up your repeater.

310
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:57,390
Hey, wait a minute.

311
00:38:58,369 --> 00:39:00,360
I've lived through one of those.

312
00:39:01,439 --> 00:39:02,428
Let me do it.

313
00:39:02,873 --> 00:39:04,397
Sync your repeater, Funsch.

314
00:39:10,414 --> 00:39:11,574
All right.

315
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:17,011
When the green light turns red
and stays steady and Yulaw is dead...

316
00:39:17,288 --> 00:39:18,277
And you.

317
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:21,055
You know what to do.

318
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:30,026
Not a problem.

319
00:39:33,337 --> 00:39:38,172
Us splitting up, you going solo,
is way out of procedure.

320
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:42,403
So listen to me. I know where you're from,
what you've been through...

321
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,277
...but this place is different.

322
00:39:44,648 --> 00:39:46,912
Not everyone is a combatant.

323
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:49,686
There are innocent people here, also.

324
00:39:50,121 --> 00:39:53,579
So if you get into the shit,
you trust your heart...

325
00:39:53,858 --> 00:39:55,587
...not your head.

326
00:39:58,429 --> 00:39:59,987
Loud and clear, sir.

327
00:40:04,268 --> 00:40:06,759
How did that son of a bitch
get out of here?

328
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:12,839
Have you seen that new video,
Mr. Fanny's Been A-Pluggin'? It's hot!

329
00:40:13,377 --> 00:40:14,844
Dude, I like Janine.

330
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:19,076
But she don't do guys.
That girl-girl stuff gets old.

331
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:22,886
Why don't you rent one of those big-ass,
she-male tapes, you freak?

332
00:40:24,121 --> 00:40:25,452
Shut up!

333
00:40:31,962 --> 00:40:35,830
I can't determine occipital lobe swelling
without a complete MRI.

334
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:39,334
- He was acting schizophrenic.
- Schizophrenia doesn't just kick in.

335
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:43,062
The triggering stressor of being shot
caused a psychotic break.

336
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:47,600
The Fifth Division is looking for him.

337
00:40:47,678 --> 00:40:50,806
They understand he's not himself.
They know how to bring him in.

338
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:52,343
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

339
00:40:52,416 --> 00:40:55,078
- Need a doctor?
- No, I'm all right.

340
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:58,755
I am not going to let
anything happen to him.

341
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:01,850
If it wasn't for Gabe,
I wouldn't be in this uniform.

342
00:41:01,926 --> 00:41:03,359
Thanks, Bobby.

343
00:41:03,694 --> 00:41:06,162
- Maybe it's best if I go home.
- Good idea.

344
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:09,290
Nothing you can do here,
and he's likely to contact you there.

345
00:41:09,366 --> 00:41:12,858
If I hear from him, I'll let you know.
If you hear anything, I'll be home.

346
00:41:12,937 --> 00:41:14,700
I know. I'm going to take you.

347
00:41:14,839 --> 00:41:16,670
I appreciate it, but I'll be fine.

348
00:41:16,841 --> 00:41:21,471
We'll make sure of it. There are four units
on the way to your house. Come on.

349
00:41:39,597 --> 00:41:42,293
- Circle around. I'll meet you out front.
- All right.

350
00:42:45,329 --> 00:42:48,492
Just when I find something
I like in this universe.

351
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:50,500
Turn off the radio slowly.

352
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:31,772
Who are you?

353
00:43:32,309 --> 00:43:36,769
You're close to his strength.
The last two years, you've gotten stronger.

354
00:43:36,847 --> 00:43:39,680
Haven't jacked any more iron.
Haven't changed your diet.

355
00:43:39,883 --> 00:43:41,180
But you are stronger.

356
00:43:41,518 --> 00:43:45,511
Your mind, too.
Answers come fast without thinking.

357
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:47,887
Who are you? What did you do to me?

358
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:54,094
Not me. You.
You've done this to yourself.

359
00:44:00,738 --> 00:44:03,571
Just like old times, eh, buddy?

360
00:44:04,174 --> 00:44:05,641
Not exactly...

361
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:07,470
...buddy.

362
00:44:08,379 --> 00:44:10,370
Put your hands back on the wheel, Yulaw.

363
00:44:15,586 --> 00:44:17,713
Space is shaped like this.

364
00:44:17,921 --> 00:44:20,048
You believe this is the only universe.

365
00:44:20,257 --> 00:44:24,125
There's not just one universe,
there's a Multiverse.

366
00:44:24,361 --> 00:44:27,455
Every time a massive star dies
and becomes a black hole...

367
00:44:27,698 --> 00:44:30,030
...a new universe is created.

368
00:44:31,702 --> 00:44:35,900
They've learned to forecast
where and when a black hole will occur.

369
00:44:36,106 --> 00:44:38,802
A momentary bridge
between parallel universes.

370
00:44:39,043 --> 00:44:40,635
Travel is restricted.

371
00:44:40,711 --> 00:44:44,078
They created an agency
to police the Multiverse.

372
00:44:44,148 --> 00:44:46,116
I'm a Multiverse agent.

373
00:44:46,784 --> 00:44:48,775
You're a nut.

374
00:44:49,219 --> 00:44:51,483
You're the one who's been seeing yourself.

375
00:44:51,889 --> 00:44:55,052
In this universe, you're you.
In another, you don't exist.

376
00:44:55,426 --> 00:44:57,587
In another,
you're married to the same woman.

377
00:44:57,661 --> 00:45:01,028
In another, to a different woman.
In another, you're married to a man.

378
00:45:01,098 --> 00:45:05,228
There's an energy, strain, wave,
connecting all those lives.

379
00:45:05,302 --> 00:45:06,599
We all have one.

380
00:45:06,670 --> 00:45:09,468
The one between you and him
has gotten stronger.

381
00:45:11,075 --> 00:45:13,270
You've been feeling him, haven't you?

382
00:45:15,846 --> 00:45:20,249
Harry, nobody's proved
that what I'm doing is a bad thing.

383
00:45:20,484 --> 00:45:24,614
You've killed 123 people.
I'd say that was a very bad thing.

384
00:45:24,688 --> 00:45:27,156
You don't know what'd happen
if you killed this one.

385
00:45:27,224 --> 00:45:29,818
It could destroy the system,
but that doesn't matter.

386
00:45:29,893 --> 00:45:35,263
I know. Everything must be balanced.
The party line.

387
00:45:35,699 --> 00:45:37,496
What do you think would happen?

388
00:45:38,969 --> 00:45:42,302
Some people think you'd explode,
some people think you'd implode.

389
00:45:43,474 --> 00:45:44,839
You're missing one.

390
00:45:46,844 --> 00:45:48,971
Some people think you'd become a god.

391
00:45:49,546 --> 00:45:51,309
That's the one.

392
00:46:52,276 --> 00:46:56,576
The man you've been seeing,
the "you," he was an MVA agent.

393
00:46:57,080 --> 00:47:01,881
Once he was forced to defend himself
against himself in another universe.

394
00:47:02,686 --> 00:47:04,051
Killed him.

395
00:47:05,389 --> 00:47:09,189
In doing so, part of the other life's energy
transferred to him.

396
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:13,287
Made him stronger.
Made all of you stronger.

397
00:47:13,864 --> 00:47:17,857
Each time he kills one of you,
the energy divides among the survivors.

398
00:47:19,069 --> 00:47:20,297
So, I'm next?

399
00:47:21,371 --> 00:47:23,532
You're the last.

400
00:47:24,041 --> 00:47:26,271
You and him are it.

401
00:48:04,915 --> 00:48:07,008
I don't want any part of this.

402
00:48:07,985 --> 00:48:09,680
You don't have a choice.

403
00:48:18,762 --> 00:48:23,062
First choice, give up. Second choice, die.

404
00:48:27,237 --> 00:48:28,795
Third choice.

405
00:48:36,813 --> 00:48:39,111
So, if everything you say is true...

406
00:48:42,286 --> 00:48:43,651
...what happens to me?

407
00:48:45,222 --> 00:48:46,814
Nobody's got all the answers.

408
00:48:48,058 --> 00:48:50,652
I don't believe you. Stay away.

409
00:49:46,016 --> 00:49:48,007
I'm alone now.

410
00:49:48,952 --> 00:49:50,544
I'm here to help you.

411
00:50:02,132 --> 00:50:04,498
Sir, I have to ask you to hold it right there.

412
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:11,667
I said freeze, asshole!

413
00:50:21,351 --> 00:50:23,046
Don't you people ever learn?

414
00:51:50,907 --> 00:51:52,238
Clear.

415
00:51:58,415 --> 00:52:00,280
Let them have a look first.

416
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:03,252
I have to do my girl stuff.

417
00:52:06,623 --> 00:52:07,612
Thanks.

418
00:53:02,579 --> 00:53:03,671
TV is on.

419
00:53:04,114 --> 00:53:05,911
Yeah, I left it on.

420
00:53:06,249 --> 00:53:09,218
When I got the call about Gabe, I just ran.

421
00:53:09,619 --> 00:53:12,747
Grabbed my jacket, rushed downstairs.

422
00:53:13,323 --> 00:53:14,756
I'll turn it off.

423
00:53:38,748 --> 00:53:40,045
Bobby?

424
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:45,412
I appreciate you being here with me
and I don't want to sound rude, but...

425
00:53:45,822 --> 00:53:47,653
...can I have a little privacy?

426
00:53:48,858 --> 00:53:50,450
Sorry, T.K.

427
00:53:56,132 --> 00:53:57,599
I'll be right outside.

428
00:53:57,968 --> 00:53:59,299
Thanks.

429
00:54:47,584 --> 00:54:49,779
I told you it's not wasted space.

430
00:54:50,053 --> 00:54:51,680
You all right?

431
00:54:52,255 --> 00:54:55,349
- I'm afraid.
- Me, too.

432
00:54:57,594 --> 00:54:59,027
Is it safe to come down?

433
00:55:00,230 --> 00:55:02,494
No, there are sheriffs all over.

434
00:55:03,033 --> 00:55:04,227
I need my gun.

435
00:55:05,735 --> 00:55:07,532
I left it at the hospital.

436
00:55:08,538 --> 00:55:10,665
I need a weapon.

437
00:55:15,445 --> 00:55:17,072
Yeah, okay.

438
00:55:51,848 --> 00:55:52,837
What's wrong?

439
00:55:54,050 --> 00:55:54,982
Nothing.

440
00:55:55,719 --> 00:55:58,279
They can see inside.
I'm just gonna pull the shade.

441
00:56:22,412 --> 00:56:26,041
Jesus. Did you ever think
when we met that day at the bookstore...

442
00:56:26,116 --> 00:56:28,141
...we'd be in this kind of mess?

443
00:56:33,556 --> 00:56:36,821
Even if I knew, I still would have come in.

444
00:56:38,328 --> 00:56:39,659
It wasn't a bookstore.

445
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:44,124
Just so you know,
I'm going to take that gun...

446
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:47,499
...and kill you
before you can pull the trigger.

447
00:56:47,670 --> 00:56:51,629
There's nothing you can do
except give it to me.

448
00:57:16,733 --> 00:57:18,291
Gabe, drop it!

449
00:57:19,969 --> 00:57:21,163
Drop it now!

450
00:57:24,207 --> 00:57:25,299
Drop it!

451
00:58:01,244 --> 00:58:02,734
Get in!

452
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:21,623
Hey, knock it off!

453
00:58:22,732 --> 00:58:25,599
- You're acting like him.
- I am him!

454
00:58:26,269 --> 00:58:27,827
Without her.

455
00:59:00,036 --> 00:59:04,769
My grandfather taught me
the energy of life goes in a circle...

456
00:59:04,974 --> 00:59:07,101
...in a perfect flow, balanced.

457
00:59:08,244 --> 00:59:10,735
He said, until I find my center...

458
00:59:11,481 --> 00:59:13,676
...my circle would never be whole.

459
00:59:15,652 --> 00:59:18,519
That day, I first saw her in the clinic...

460
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:22,616
...I came in with a dog
that was hit by a car.

461
00:59:24,694 --> 00:59:27,595
I knew right away she was my center.

462
00:59:28,097 --> 00:59:29,758
She made me whole.

463
00:59:33,903 --> 00:59:35,393
How do I kill him?

464
00:59:46,349 --> 00:59:50,581
In an hour, there's a forecasted
wormhole opening. Three-minute window.

465
00:59:54,557 --> 00:59:56,650
He's attuned to your life wave.

466
00:59:57,293 --> 01:00:00,854
He'll try to find you, kill you,
and get back to the hole.

467
01:00:01,030 --> 01:00:02,691
That's where we get him.

468
01:00:03,066 --> 01:00:05,125
Get him? Kill him!

469
01:00:05,668 --> 01:00:06,657
Kill him?

470
01:00:08,371 --> 01:00:09,702
You're serious?

471
01:00:19,182 --> 01:00:20,274
My own design.

472
01:00:20,350 --> 01:00:22,818
Highly modified M-590,
hand-portable system.

473
01:00:22,885 --> 01:00:25,115
Fires 25 smart rounds per second.

474
01:00:25,355 --> 01:00:28,153
Multiple tracking modes,
plus the latest countermeasures.

475
01:00:28,257 --> 01:00:33,024
Each round carries an explosive warhead
with selectable fuse delays.

476
01:00:33,129 --> 01:00:38,032
Tracks, enters, pauses.1 microseconds,
then "Boom!"

477
01:00:38,201 --> 01:00:40,226
Mixto rojo.

478
01:00:42,105 --> 01:00:44,096
And this is his little brother.

479
01:00:45,241 --> 01:00:46,572
Hasn't worked yet.

480
01:00:47,276 --> 01:00:50,871
Don't blame the tools.
I never had the go-ahead to terminate.

481
01:00:51,381 --> 01:00:53,315
Let me show you how.

482
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:03,819
That'll work, too.

483
01:01:04,427 --> 01:01:06,258
We kill him, then it's over.

484
01:01:07,764 --> 01:01:09,288
Hey, you two!

485
01:01:09,866 --> 01:01:11,595
Come on! Check that shit!

486
01:01:14,837 --> 01:01:15,895
Let's go.

487
01:01:17,206 --> 01:01:18,434
What are you doing?

488
01:01:18,608 --> 01:01:20,075
What are you doing?

489
01:01:21,944 --> 01:01:23,673
Permission to speak, sir.

490
01:01:25,348 --> 01:01:27,111
I know what I have to do.

491
01:01:27,684 --> 01:01:30,744
I'll never get the chance to thank you
for squaring me away.

492
01:01:33,056 --> 01:01:34,785
So, thank you, sir.

493
01:01:37,093 --> 01:01:38,958
I'm calling the cops.

494
01:01:46,669 --> 01:01:48,830
Just making sure you know, if we kill him...

495
01:01:48,905 --> 01:01:52,534
You have to kill me. Kill me! I don't care.

496
01:01:52,909 --> 01:01:56,072
As long as he's dead, I don't care.

497
01:01:56,279 --> 01:01:58,042
If we kill him...

498
01:01:58,948 --> 01:02:02,247
...there's a chance, some say,
this whole universe could go with him.

499
01:02:08,391 --> 01:02:10,951
The Chinese guy
was tearing the place apart.

500
01:02:31,914 --> 01:02:35,008
Wormhole ETA: ten minutes.

501
01:02:35,585 --> 01:02:37,018
That vicinity.

502
01:03:02,345 --> 01:03:03,676
He's here.

503
01:03:52,161 --> 01:03:53,924
Shit. Take cover!

504
01:03:53,996 --> 01:03:57,989
It's a bomb! Don't breathe for 20 seconds
after the blast!

505
01:06:21,744 --> 01:06:23,075
Yulaw!

506
01:06:24,547 --> 01:06:26,606
You came here for me.

507
01:06:27,850 --> 01:06:29,181
Now I'm here for you.

508
01:06:32,421 --> 01:06:36,858
After this, there will be only one.

509
01:06:37,226 --> 01:06:40,320
I won't be The One, but neither will you.

510
01:10:29,625 --> 01:10:30,956
Shit! Three minutes.

511
01:13:37,513 --> 01:13:39,174
Thirty seconds!

512
01:13:46,922 --> 01:13:47,946
Shit.

513
01:14:00,035 --> 01:14:02,230
Gabe, get out! Get out!

514
01:14:02,371 --> 01:14:03,929
Get out!

515
01:14:34,470 --> 01:14:35,994
That's him.

516
01:14:42,978 --> 01:14:46,573
Scanning, RHV 579. Confirm.

517
01:14:47,516 --> 01:14:49,347
Send him where he belongs.

518
01:15:02,898 --> 01:15:07,562
Destination:
Stygian Penal Colony, Hades Universe.

519
01:15:08,437 --> 01:15:11,668
Wormhole opens in one minute.

520
01:15:30,826 --> 01:15:32,191
No, stop!

521
01:15:32,694 --> 01:15:34,958
That's him, that's Yulaw.

522
01:15:35,364 --> 01:15:38,800
Wormhole opens in 30 seconds.

523
01:15:40,102 --> 01:15:41,194
Get him out!

524
01:15:45,374 --> 01:15:48,605
Wormhole opens in 20 seconds.

525
01:15:55,284 --> 01:15:58,515
Wormhole opens in ten, nine...

526
01:15:58,687 --> 01:16:00,712
...eight, seven...

527
01:16:00,789 --> 01:16:05,089
...six, five, four, three, two...

528
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:06,554
...one.

529
01:16:06,628 --> 01:16:08,926
Wormhole opened.

530
01:16:24,813 --> 01:16:26,747
That man doesn't leave this room.

531
01:16:30,385 --> 01:16:32,444
Sir, he assisted in Yulaw's capture.

532
01:16:32,821 --> 01:16:36,052
He's from an uninitiated universe
with no travel passport.

533
01:16:36,325 --> 01:16:37,349
He goes back.

534
01:16:38,226 --> 01:16:40,626
He can't go back.
They'll lock him up for life.

535
01:16:40,696 --> 01:16:43,324
He will be cared for, watched over.
Like the other.

536
01:16:43,665 --> 01:16:47,601
Balance will be preserved.
The wormhole closes in 40 seconds!

537
01:16:47,736 --> 01:16:50,170
- Sir, permission to speak...
- Permission denied.

538
01:16:50,238 --> 01:16:52,866
That order is bullshit!

539
01:16:55,310 --> 01:16:56,834
It doesn't matter.

540
01:16:57,512 --> 01:16:58,501
Take him!

541
01:17:22,571 --> 01:17:24,061
I know where he has to go.

542
01:17:27,309 --> 01:17:29,743
I have to send you where you belong.

543
01:17:33,749 --> 01:17:35,011
It's procedure.

544
01:17:37,786 --> 01:17:39,651
Coordinates accepted.

545
01:17:42,024 --> 01:17:42,854
'Bye, Gabe.

546
01:17:43,625 --> 01:17:45,616
Wormhole opens in...

547
01:17:45,761 --> 01:17:48,457
...five, four, three...

548
01:17:48,864 --> 01:17:51,332
...two, one.

549
01:17:59,574 --> 01:18:01,098
Look out!

550
01:18:03,578 --> 01:18:04,875
Hey, you all right?

551
01:18:17,459 --> 01:18:18,517
Ollie?

552
01:18:37,179 --> 01:18:39,147
Excuse me, I have a...

553
01:18:40,282 --> 01:18:41,579
What happened?

554
01:18:48,056 --> 01:18:49,045
Car.

555
01:18:51,793 --> 01:18:52,987
Do I know you?

556
01:19:16,384 --> 01:19:19,012
- Fresh fish.
- Got a pretty mouth.

557
01:19:20,655 --> 01:19:23,886
I am Yulaw! I'm nobody's bitch.

558
01:19:24,459 --> 01:19:26,984
You are mine.

559
01:19:30,165 --> 01:19:31,962
I don't need to know you.

560
01:19:32,634 --> 01:19:35,967
You only need to know me.

561
01:19:37,305 --> 01:19:39,068
I will be The One!
