00:15:10,872 --> 00:15:12,665
You have to let go.

162
00:15:13,249 --> 00:15:15,084
Ben, you're hurting me.

163
00:15:15,168 --> 00:15:16,210
Ouch.

164
00:15:16,294 --> 00:15:17,795
VIOLET: There you are.

165
00:15:17,879 --> 00:15:19,756
Time for his remedies.

166
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:22,300
Scoot over, child.

167
00:15:23,217 --> 00:15:25,720
9:00 in the morning and 7:00 at night.

168
00:15:25,803 --> 00:15:29,182
He takes his pills in powder form.
I'll show you how.

169
00:15:29,265 --> 00:15:31,351
Be sure he drinks it all down.

170
00:15:31,434 --> 00:15:34,312
CAROLINE: What's he taking?
VIOLET: Oh, Coumadin and such.

171
00:15:34,395 --> 00:15:37,899
He gets the tremors sometimes.
Don't let that frighten you.

172
00:15:39,525 --> 00:15:41,861
And a kiss to make it taste better.

173
00:15:43,696 --> 00:15:46,991
You're scrawnier than l'd hoped.
Prettier, though.

174
00:15:48,201 --> 00:15:50,870
I bet you're all marked up, aren't you?

175
00:15:51,537 --> 00:15:53,456
- Marked up?
- Written on.

176
00:15:53,748 --> 00:15:55,208
I know you young people are always...

177
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:57,960
jabbing yourselves with ink and needles.

178
00:15:58,336 --> 00:16:00,171
You're written on, aren't you?

179
00:16:00,254 --> 00:16:02,173
Not where you can see.

180
00:16:02,256 --> 00:16:03,549
Well.

181
00:16:03,716 --> 00:16:06,844
He's to be bathed daily, his linens changed.

182
00:16:07,261 --> 00:16:11,057
Don't bother with the housework.
I'm the only one that knows how.

183
00:16:12,517 --> 00:16:14,936
How long have you two lived here?

184
00:16:16,479 --> 00:16:17,855
Let's see.

185
00:16:18,481 --> 00:16:21,734
We came over from Savannah in "62.

186
00:16:22,568 --> 00:16:25,613
We bought this house
from a brother and a sister.

187
00:16:25,738 --> 00:16:29,033
They'd inherited it a long time ago,
from their parents.

188
00:16:29,409 --> 00:16:31,619
Lived here since they were children.

189
00:16:31,703 --> 00:16:34,247
VIOLET: There they are. Martin and Grace.

190
00:16:34,872 --> 00:16:36,582
VIOLET: Charming people.

191
00:16:37,542 --> 00:16:40,837
But they fell on hard times, had to sell.

192
00:16:41,379 --> 00:16:43,089
You keep their picture?

193
00:16:43,172 --> 00:16:47,010
Yes. I like to pay my respects
to the memories of this house.

194
00:17:02,608 --> 00:17:04,402
All right. Come along now.

195
00:17:11,159 --> 00:17:12,994
This is the dining room.

196
00:17:13,077 --> 00:17:14,787
We only use about half of the rooms.

197
00:17:14,871 --> 00:17:17,248
The others are for Ben's antique business.

198
00:17:17,332 --> 00:17:20,043
What he couldn't sell, we stored here.

199
00:17:20,126 --> 00:17:22,128
Except for the attic.

200
00:17:22,295 --> 00:17:24,339
That has crystal and china.

201
00:17:24,422 --> 00:17:28,092
And I keep a very close account
on that, just so as you know.

202
00:17:31,304 --> 00:17:33,848
There are more than 30 rooms in all.

203
00:17:34,057 --> 00:17:37,643
In the old days, they made
a separate key for each room.

204
00:17:37,727 --> 00:17:40,897
For the owner, they made a skeleton key.

205
00:17:41,856 --> 00:17:43,900
This will open every door.

206
00:17:44,525 --> 00:17:46,194
This one is yours.

207
00:17:47,487 --> 00:17:48,905
I have mine.

208
00:17:50,365 --> 00:17:52,200
Now, the pantry's right out here.

209
00:17:52,283 --> 00:17:56,079
You know, we may have to ask you
to go into town now and then.

210
00:17:56,162 --> 00:17:58,081
Was there a mirror here once?

211
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:03,294
I noticed in the bathrooms also
there are no mirrors.

212
00:18:03,378 --> 00:18:06,464
Child, when you get as worn-out
and wrinkled as we are...

213
00:18:06,547 --> 00:18:08,299
you don't need any reminding.

214
00:18:08,383 --> 00:18:10,510
If you want a small one
for your own purposes...

215
00:18:10,593 --> 00:18:11,678
that's fine with me.

216
00:18:11,761 --> 00:18:14,555
- What'd you do with them?
- Put them away.

217
00:18:20,311 --> 00:18:22,814
VIOLET: The boy tells me you don't smoke.

218
00:18:22,897 --> 00:18:25,983
I do smoke. I smoke a lot
and I enjoy it very much.

219
00:18:26,067 --> 00:18:27,485
I trust that won't be an issue.

220
00:18:27,568 --> 00:18:28,653
It won't be.

221
00:18:28,736 --> 00:18:31,239
Good. Then for the most part
just realize that...

222
00:18:31,322 --> 00:18:33,491
l'll live here as if you're not in residence.

223
00:18:33,574 --> 00:18:37,036
After all, we're not kin.
Are your parents still alive?

224
00:18:38,246 --> 00:18:42,667
My mom left when I was little. My
dad raised me and he died last year.

225
00:18:43,084 --> 00:18:46,212
Oh, my. So you cared for him as well?

226
00:18:47,755 --> 00:18:49,257
I would have.

227
00:18:49,549 --> 00:18:51,884
I just thought I had more time.

228
00:18:55,013 --> 00:18:56,097
Yeah.

229
00:18:57,098 --> 00:19:00,351
You think too much about the time
you have left...

230
00:19:00,893 --> 00:19:02,937
you don't spend it living.

231
00:19:03,187 --> 00:19:06,274
Be good to my husband.

back in New Jersey, I expect.

00:19:35,094 --> 00:19:37,472
Actually, it's the Garden State.

236
00:19:37,972 --> 00:19:40,141
[Laughing] I doubt that very much.

237
00:19:41,726 --> 00:19:44,312

00:19:53,446 --> 00:19:55,573
I try to keep an open mind.

241
00:19:55,907 --> 00:19:57,992
That's good. That's very good.

242
00:19:59,243 --> 00:20:00,995
Where are my trilliums?

243
00:20:01,079 --> 00:20:04,332
Oh, fiddlesticks. Do me a blessing, child.

244
00:20:04,749 --> 00:20:06,668
Will you run up to the attic for me?

245
00:20:06,751 --> 00:20:10,463
I have some seed packets in a box
right next to the stairs.

I'm sorry.

251

I thought the key opens everything.

252
00:23:10,852 --> 00:23:12,895
The key? What key?

253
00:23:12,979 --> 00:23:14,939
The key you gave me for the house.

254
00:23:15,023 --> 00:23:17,859
There's a door in the attic
it doesn't work for.

255
00:23:18,359 --> 00:23:21,195
Oh, no, the attic, it's never opened that.

256
00:23:22,238 --> 00:23:24,907
- I got my Dixie-Johns.
- Why not?

257
00:23:26,034 --> 00:23:28,453
- What's in there?
- I have no idea.

You'll have to ask him, child.

VIOLET: The servants were up there
wtth the chtldren.

483
00:45:49,627 --> 00:45:53,047
They were trying to teach them
how to conjure hoodoo.

484
00:45:53,131 --> 00:45:54,841
MAN: And take his head.

485
00:45:56,259 --> 00:45:59,971
Thorpe went about insane,
and so dtd the rest of the guests.

486
00:46:02,181 --> 00:46:05,101
I mean, how long had thts blasphemy
been going on?

487
00:46:06,144 --> 00:46:09,981
The chtldren satd tt was thetr
fault, that they'd wanted to learn.

488
00:46:10,523 --> 00:46:12,900
But they weren't having any of that.

489
00:46:14,235 --> 00:46:15,737
[Woman screaming]

490
00:46:35,089 --> 00:46:39,594
All that power and rage and insantty.

491
00:46:49,437 --> 00:46:51,064
The party was over.

492
00:47:04,577 --> 00:47:06,579
It was a terrible thing.

493
00:47:07,622 --> 00:47:08,915
Terrible.

494
00:47:13,086 --> 00:47:16,297
Rumours got out, but no arrests, no trial.

495
00:47:18,174 --> 00:47:19,884
Money had its way.

496
00:47:22,929 --> 00:47:25,139
What happened to the family?

497
00:47:25,223 --> 00:47:26,974
The bank went under.

498
00:47:27,308 --> 00:47:31,396
Thorpe shot his wife to death,
and then turned the gun on himself.

499
00:47:34,023 --> 00:47:37,860
People in the bayou say
it was Justify and Cecile's revenge.

500
00:47:38,319 --> 00:47:40,989
The children stayed here till "62.

501
00:47:42,448 --> 00:47:46,786
But they never, ever, told us
why that room was locked.

502
00:47:48,496 --> 00:47:51,624
Or why there were no mirrors
in the whole house.

503
00:47:54,127 --> 00:47:55,545
Now we know.

504
00:47:55,962 --> 00:47:57,505
You know what?

505
00:47:59,924 --> 00:48:02,719
You see them in the mirrors.

506
00:48:04,345 --> 00:48:05,430
Who?

507
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:07,015
The servants.

508
00:48:07,849 --> 00:48:10,935
I've gone and read
some hoodoo books, and they say...

509
00:48:11,019 --> 00:48:14,063
- putting brick dust down'II keep harm away.
- Mrs. Devereaux.

510
00:48:14,147 --> 00:48:17,025
So I made a big circle of it around
the whole house.

511
00:48:17,108 --> 00:48:20,945
You can't expect me to believe
you see ghosts in your mirrors.

512
00:48:24,365 --> 00:48:26,367
The ghosts are here now.

513
00:48:29,078 --> 00:48:31,414
But whatever they did to him...

514
00:48:32,165 --> 00:48:34,834
I am not going to let them do it to me.

515
00:48:41,924 --> 00:48:43,718
Now you'll leave...

516
00:48:45,303 --> 00:48:47,388
like all the rest of them.

517
00:48:48,388 --> 00:48:58,388
