00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,420
There are few places harder to get to
in this world.

2
00:01:40,598 --> 00:01:43,805
But there aren't any
where it's harder to live.

3
00:01:44,539 --> 00:01:47,299
The average temperature here
at the bottom of the Earth...

4
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,863
...is a balmy 58 degrees below.

5
00:01:50,041 --> 00:01:52,423
That's when the sun is out.

6
00:01:52,841 --> 00:01:54,385
It wasn't always like this.

7
00:01:55,299 --> 00:01:57,916
Antarctica used to be a tropical place...

8
00:01:58,135 --> 00:02:01,272
...densely forested and teeming with life.

9
00:02:01,455 --> 00:02:04,557
But then the continent
started to drift south.

10
00:02:04,741 --> 00:02:06,781
And by the time it was done drifting...

11
00:02:06,953 --> 00:02:10,821
...the dense forests had all been replaced
with a new ground cover:

12
00:02:11,001 --> 00:02:12,688
Ice.

13
00:02:15,775 --> 00:02:20,434
As for the former inhabitants.
they had all died or moved on long ago.

14
00:02:20,616 --> 00:02:24,308
Well, almost all of them.

15
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:30,634
Legend has it that one tribe
stayed behind.

16
00:02:39,779 --> 00:02:42,716
Perhaps they thought the change
in weather was only temporary.

17
00:02:42,892 --> 00:02:46,277
Or maybe they were just stubborn.

18
00:02:46,627 --> 00:02:52,288
But whatever their reasons.
these stalwart souls refused to leave.

19
00:02:53,269 --> 00:02:55,722
For millions of years
they have made their home...

20
00:02:55,897 --> 00:03:00,626
...on the darkest, driest, windiest
and coldest continent on Earth.

21
00:03:02,123 --> 00:03:05,365
And they've done so pretty much alone.

22
00:03:05,548 --> 00:03:08,827
So in some ways
this is a story of survival.

23
00:03:09,007 --> 00:03:11,319
A tale of life over death.

24
00:03:11,496 --> 00:03:13,843
But it's more than that, really.

25
00:03:14,022 --> 00:03:16,298
This is a story about love.

26
00:03:25,021 --> 00:03:29,443
Like most love stories, it begins
with an act of utter foolishness.

27
00:03:36,332 --> 00:03:39,232
The emperor penguin
is technically a bird.

28
00:03:39,445 --> 00:03:42,794
Although one that makes his home
in the sea.

29
00:03:43,491 --> 00:03:46,391
So if you're wondering
what he's doing up here on the ice...

30
00:03:46,569 --> 00:03:49,741
...well, that's part of our story.

31
00:03:49,925 --> 00:03:52,024
Each year at around the same time...

32
00:03:52,209 --> 00:03:54,520
...he will leave the comfort
of his ocean home...

33
00:03:54,698 --> 00:03:57,080
...and embark
on a remarkable journey.

34
00:03:57,257 --> 00:03:59,815
He will travel a great distance...

35
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:02,607
...and though he is a bird.
he won't fly.

36
00:04:02,793 --> 00:04:06,142
Though he lives in the sea.
he won't swim.

37
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:08,973
Mostly, he will walk.

38
00:04:09,158 --> 00:04:10,737
But he won't walk alone.

39
00:04:24,584 --> 00:04:27,484
It is March.
Summer is over.

40
00:04:27,662 --> 00:04:31,602
And another long polar winter
is about to begin.

41
00:04:32,296 --> 00:04:36,613
The birds have been feeding
in the ocean waters for three months.

42
00:04:36,793 --> 00:04:39,281
Now, their bellies full...

43
00:04:39,456 --> 00:04:42,628
...it is time to find a mate.

44
00:04:47,792 --> 00:04:51,412
Their breeding ground can be
up to 70 miles away.

45
00:04:51,597 --> 00:04:56,256
To get there they will walk
day and night continuously.

46
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:59,235
Sometimes for a week.

47
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:04,972
It is a long, dangerous
and seemingly impossible journey.

48
00:05:05,156 --> 00:05:08,057
And some of them will not survive it.

49
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:38,064
Nonetheless, when the last of the clan
has finally clamored onto the ice...

50
00:05:38,239 --> 00:05:40,480
...their long march will begin...

51
00:05:40,659 --> 00:05:44,315
...just as it has for thousands of years.

52
00:07:16,714 --> 00:07:19,579
The destination is always the same.

53
00:07:19,758 --> 00:07:21,822
Their path, however, is not.

54
00:07:23,562 --> 00:07:27,666
The ice on which the birds travel
never stops shifting and changing.

55
00:07:27,852 --> 00:07:31,991
New roadblocks will appear
to baffle them every year.

56
00:07:33,974 --> 00:07:37,806
We're not exactly sure
how they find their way.

57
00:07:37,985 --> 00:07:40,602
Perhaps they were assisted by the sun.

58
00:07:40,787 --> 00:07:42,366
Or the stars.

59
00:07:42,552 --> 00:07:46,208
Or maybe having taken this march
for thousands of generations...

60
00:07:46,391 --> 00:07:49,363
...they are guided by some invisible
compass within them.

61
00:07:51,129 --> 00:07:52,957
They never stay stumped for long.

62
00:07:53,135 --> 00:07:55,658
Eventually, one of them
will pick up the trail.

63
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:58,416
And the journey continues.

64
00:08:23,989 --> 00:08:27,928
When they get tired of walking.
they'll give their feet a rest.

65
00:08:28,105 --> 00:08:31,041
They'll use their bellies instead.

66
00:09:28,221 --> 00:09:31,983
Theirs is usually a graceful parade.

67
00:09:32,785 --> 00:09:34,849
But not always.

68
00:09:50,702 --> 00:09:54,464
Each day the temperature drops
a little further.

69
00:09:55,372 --> 00:09:58,273
And the sun will set earlier.

70
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:05,049
The weather becomes noticeably harsher
almost by the hour.

71
00:10:10,038 --> 00:10:14,767
By now similar caravans are approaching
from every direction.

72
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:19,514
And finally, often on the same day...

73
00:10:19,687 --> 00:10:21,928
...even around the same time...

74
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:27,747
...they will arrive at the place where
each and every one of them was born.

75
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,901
Here they will mate in relative safety.

76
00:11:21,086 --> 00:11:24,576
They are now far from the water's edge
where most predators lurk.

77
00:11:24,751 --> 00:11:29,410
And the large ice walls will offer
some protection from the harshest winds.

78
00:11:29,594 --> 00:11:32,047
But the real reason
they have chosen this place...

79
00:11:32,222 --> 00:11:33,802
...lies beneath their feet.

80
00:11:33,987 --> 00:11:35,708
The ice is thicker here.

81
00:11:35,889 --> 00:11:37,988
It will stay solid until summer...

82
00:11:38,171 --> 00:11:41,179
...keeping their young
from accidentally falling through...

83
00:11:41,354 --> 00:11:43,936
...into the freezing ocean.

84
00:11:46,785 --> 00:11:49,580
And so, having arrived...

85
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:52,554
...they begin to pursue
their journey's purpose:

86
00:11:52,733 --> 00:11:55,221
Finding a mate.

87
00:11:55,398 --> 00:11:58,193
We don't really know
what they're looking for in a partner.

88
00:11:58,372 --> 00:12:02,240
We only know that they are.
in fact, looking.

89
00:12:02,868 --> 00:12:07,432
We also know when they've found
what they're looking for.

90
00:12:16,635 --> 00:12:20,291
Emperor penguins are monogamous.
Sort of.

91
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:23,303
They mate with only one partner
per year.

92
00:12:23,484 --> 00:12:28,177
Which means every new season.
all bets are off.

93
00:12:30,989 --> 00:12:33,996
Because there are fewer males
than females here...

94
00:12:34,171 --> 00:12:37,626
...hostilities among the ladies
are inevitable.

95
00:12:37,804 --> 00:12:41,388
A taken male instantly
becomes an unavailable male.

96
00:12:41,573 --> 00:12:46,927
So occasionally, a female will attempt
to interrupt a courtship.

97
00:12:54,337 --> 00:12:56,612
The men don't seem to mind.

98
00:12:56,792 --> 00:13:01,909
They just wait for the fight to end
and take the opportunity to preen.

99
00:13:05,683 --> 00:13:08,725
They're not that different from us, really.

100
00:13:10,871 --> 00:13:12,699
They pout.

101
00:13:12,877 --> 00:13:14,634
They bellow.

102
00:13:14,883 --> 00:13:16,640
They strut.

103
00:13:18,065 --> 00:13:23,207
And occasionally, they will engage
in some contact sports.

104
00:14:21,329 --> 00:14:24,501
Within a few weeks.
one way or the other...

105
00:14:24,683 --> 00:14:28,693
...most of the animals have found
the one they are looking for.

106
00:17:27,622 --> 00:17:29,002
For the next eight months...

107
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:33,603
...these two will participate
in an ancient and complicated affair.

108
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:35,844
There will be tenderness.

109
00:17:36,028 --> 00:17:37,927
There will be separation.

110
00:17:38,104 --> 00:17:39,719
There will be reunion.

111
00:17:39,902 --> 00:17:44,667
And if their partnership is successful.
there will be new life.

112
00:17:44,918 --> 00:17:47,818
For now, they wait...

113
00:17:47,995 --> 00:17:50,448
...for the egg and for the brutal winter...

114
00:17:50,624 --> 00:17:54,457
...which will do everything in its power
to destroy that egg.

115
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:29,284
By May the light will nearly
have disappeared from the sky...

116
00:18:29,468 --> 00:18:32,440
...and the temperature
continues to drop.

117
00:18:34,829 --> 00:18:38,179
And for those who began
their march too late...

118
00:18:38,358 --> 00:18:42,368
...or have fallen behind
because of weakness or hunger...

119
00:18:42,544 --> 00:18:46,306
...hope of survival is now remote.

120
00:18:54,475 --> 00:18:58,060
The lone penguin has no chance
against the winter's cold.

121
00:18:58,247 --> 00:18:59,969
He will simply fade away...

122
00:19:00,149 --> 00:19:04,229
...absorbed by the great whiteness
all around him.

123
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,657
As winter descends...

124
00:19:51,838 --> 00:19:55,010
...the tribe's only defense
against the freezing cold...

125
00:19:55,191 --> 00:19:57,089
...is the group itself.

126
00:19:57,266 --> 00:20:01,653
It is almost as if they create
another organism altogether.

127
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:06,360
The huddled animals form
a single moving mass...

128
00:20:06,536 --> 00:20:11,029
...one designed for the sole purpose
of sustaining warmth.

129
00:20:13,178 --> 00:20:17,352
Winter's first storm is upon them.

130
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:11,937
Within a few weeks, days begin to pass
with virtually no light at all.

131
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:18,847
Moons come and go
in the soon-to-be-endless night.

132
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:24,387
And finally, one day in early June...

133
00:21:24,563 --> 00:21:27,736
...we remember why they came here.

134
00:21:44,972 --> 00:21:49,501
As soon as the egg appears.
it is instantly hidden from the cold.

135
00:21:49,675 --> 00:21:52,717
The tiny beating heart
within the shell cannot survive...

136
00:21:52,891 --> 00:21:56,724
...much more than a moment's exposure
to the freezing air.

137
00:22:28,726 --> 00:22:32,346
From now on, the couple has
but a single goal:

138
00:22:32,532 --> 00:22:35,221
Keeping their egg alive.

139
00:22:35,402 --> 00:22:39,058
The hungry mother must return at once
to the sea to eat.

140
00:22:39,241 --> 00:22:43,451
But before she leaves.
she must entrust the egg to its father.

141
00:22:56,950 --> 00:23:02,823
Some, young couples, perhaps.
are too impulsive or rushed.

142
00:23:07,085 --> 00:23:11,366
And within moments.
their affair comes to an end.

143
00:23:20,644 --> 00:23:22,649
They can only watch...

144
00:23:22,823 --> 00:23:25,901
...as the ice claims their egg...

145
00:23:26,074 --> 00:23:28,386
...and the life within it.

146
00:23:48,868 --> 00:23:52,253
This couple's partnership is now over.

147
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,718
The long march in vain.

148
00:23:55,993 --> 00:23:58,305
With no reason to stay...

149
00:23:58,485 --> 00:24:01,245
...they will wander back to the sea.

150
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:08,125
Other couples have lost their egg as well.

151
00:24:10,521 --> 00:24:12,655
As for the others...

152
00:24:12,838 --> 00:24:15,739
...their partnership is about to change.

153
00:24:16,194 --> 00:24:18,127
With unending patience...

154
00:24:18,305 --> 00:24:21,866
...the pair rehearses the steps
they will need to transfer the egg...

155
00:24:22,039 --> 00:24:25,246
...from the mother to the father.

156
00:24:31,932 --> 00:24:36,661
They practice this clumsy ballet
dozens of times if need be.

157
00:24:38,954 --> 00:24:42,268
And then, with great care...

158
00:24:42,447 --> 00:24:44,581
...they will dance it.

159
00:25:12,643 --> 00:25:15,850
And now begins one of nature's
most incredible...

160
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:19,488
...and endearing role reversals.

161
00:25:20,738 --> 00:25:25,195
It is the penguin male
who will tend the couple's single egg.

162
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:30,142
While the mother feeds and gathers food
to bring back for the newborn...

163
00:25:30,317 --> 00:25:35,566
...it is the father who will shield the egg
from the violent winds and cold.

164
00:25:35,782 --> 00:25:39,167
He will make a nest for the egg
atop his own claws...

165
00:25:39,346 --> 00:25:44,253
...keeping it safe and warm
beneath a flap of skin on his belly.

166
00:25:47,648 --> 00:25:51,999
And he will do this
for more than two months.

167
00:26:22,859 --> 00:26:24,509
Having passed the egg...

168
00:26:24,693 --> 00:26:27,665
...the exhausted female
must depart quickly.

169
00:26:30,364 --> 00:26:33,536
She must eat soon or she will die.

170
00:26:39,945 --> 00:26:42,185
As the winter progresses...

171
00:26:42,367 --> 00:26:45,197
...the father will be severely tested.

172
00:26:49,076 --> 00:26:51,800
The mother will be tested as well.

173
00:26:51,982 --> 00:26:55,331
Her return trip to the sea
is considerably more difficult...

174
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:58,587
...than the original march
to the nesting ground.

175
00:26:58,761 --> 00:27:00,412
It is colder now.

176
00:27:00,594 --> 00:27:05,194
And she will have lost almost a third
of her body weight producing the egg.

177
00:27:05,369 --> 00:27:08,754
She is literally starving.

178
00:27:10,106 --> 00:27:12,594
Of course, the fathers
are nearly starving too.

179
00:27:12,769 --> 00:27:17,156
But for them, a meal is far off
in the distance.

180
00:27:17,751 --> 00:27:20,546
By the time their vigil
atop the egg is over...

181
00:27:20,727 --> 00:27:24,076
...the penguin fathers will have gone
without food of any kind...

182
00:27:24,253 --> 00:27:26,706
...for over 1 25 days.

183
00:27:26,883 --> 00:27:29,784
And they will have endured
one of the most violent...

184
00:27:29,962 --> 00:27:32,309
...and deadly winters on Earth.

185
00:27:32,485 --> 00:27:35,528
All for the chick.

186
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:06,157
As the fathers settle into their long wait
at the breeding ground...

187
00:30:06,341 --> 00:30:09,030
...the winter's second storm arrives.

188
00:30:09,210 --> 00:30:12,902
The temperature is now 80 degrees
below zero.

189
00:30:13,084 --> 00:30:15,738
That's without taking into account
the wind...

190
00:30:15,921 --> 00:30:19,825
...which can blow 100 miles an hour.

191
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:29,924
Though they can be aggressive
during the rest of the year...

192
00:30:30,104 --> 00:30:32,969
...at this time
the males are totally docile.

193
00:30:33,147 --> 00:30:35,942
A united and cooperative team...

194
00:30:36,121 --> 00:30:41,263
...they brace against the storm by merging
their thousand bodies into a single mass.

195
00:30:41,449 --> 00:30:43,028
They will take turns...

196
00:30:43,212 --> 00:30:46,903
...each of them getting to spend some
time near the center of their huddle...

197
00:30:47,086 --> 00:30:49,503
...where it's warmer.

198
00:31:15,241 --> 00:31:16,656
As they move about...

199
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:20,937
...the fathers will balance their eggs
like tightrope walkers.

200
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:02,022
The exhausted mothers
have marched 70 miles.

201
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:06,106
They are now back
where they started three months ago.

202
00:33:06,628 --> 00:33:09,635
But they aren't anywhere near
the water's edge.

203
00:33:09,810 --> 00:33:12,570
New ice is formed along the shore...

204
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:17,621
...forcing them to walk several more miles
before they reach the sea.

205
00:33:24,441 --> 00:33:27,484
Food is actually
only a few inches below them.

206
00:33:28,558 --> 00:33:31,353
But they have no way
of getting to it here.

207
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:50,839
To survive they must reach
the new ice edge...

208
00:33:51,050 --> 00:33:53,880
...or find some other opening.

209
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:59,963
Sometimes this search will last for days.

210
00:35:09,879 --> 00:35:14,678
Naturally, after their long walk.
they are eager to get back in the water.

211
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:18,422
Sometimes a little too eager.

212
00:36:33,583 --> 00:36:37,144
They can hold their breath
for over 1 5 minutes...

213
00:36:38,081 --> 00:36:42,255
...and dive to a depth of 1 700 feet...

214
00:36:43,199 --> 00:36:49,143
...approaching the sea floor itself
to feed on fish, krill and squid.

215
00:36:59,561 --> 00:37:03,983
They will also skim along the ice
just below the ocean's surface...

216
00:37:04,159 --> 00:37:07,685
...searching for any fish
that may have lodged there.

217
00:37:12,289 --> 00:37:15,674
While the mothers finally
fill their empty bellies...

218
00:37:15,850 --> 00:37:18,645
...the fathers cling to life
on the surface...

219
00:37:18,825 --> 00:37:22,280
...trying to keep the eggs
safe and warm.

220
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:45,112
The wind will occasionally bring snow
to quench the males' thirst.

221
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:50,951
They have been without food now
for over three months.

222
00:37:52,065 --> 00:37:56,629
Each day brings them closer
to exhaustion and starvation.

223
00:38:01,577 --> 00:38:05,716
Eventually some.
usually the older ones...

224
00:38:05,901 --> 00:38:07,728
...will simply fall asleep...

225
00:38:07,908 --> 00:38:10,077
...and disappear.

226
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:00,254
Now it is dark almost all the time.

227
00:39:02,718 --> 00:39:06,445
And the mother of all blizzards
is about to arrive.

228
00:39:11,194 --> 00:39:13,092
The fathers now make an extra effort...

229
00:39:13,269 --> 00:39:16,889
...to weld their bodies together
and resist the winter's rage.

230
00:39:22,123 --> 00:39:26,062
Above them, the southern lights
dance virtually around the clock.

231
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:30,107
For now there is almost only night.

232
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:56,658
The hungry mothers aren't the only ones
overjoyed by their return to the sea.

233
00:39:56,832 --> 00:40:02,080
Their predators, unfortunately.
are happy to have them back as well.

234
00:41:06,562 --> 00:41:08,425
With a snap of its jaws...

235
00:41:08,603 --> 00:41:12,058
...the leopard seal
actually takes two lives.

236
00:41:12,305 --> 00:41:14,027
That of the trapped mother...

237
00:41:14,206 --> 00:41:18,003
...and that of her unborn chick
who will never be fed.

238
00:41:27,488 --> 00:41:32,842
By July the females know
it is time to return to their nest.

239
00:41:33,231 --> 00:41:37,925
And so, for the third time this year.
the mothers take the long walk.

240
00:41:40,148 --> 00:41:41,798
Only this time...

241
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:44,220
...they walk in the dark.

242
00:42:13,804 --> 00:42:17,460
The ravenous and freezing night lingers...

243
00:42:17,642 --> 00:42:20,060
...seemingly without end.

244
00:42:20,409 --> 00:42:22,307
Until finally...

245
00:42:22,484 --> 00:42:26,069
...the darkness begins
its slow retreat.

246
00:43:36,678 --> 00:43:41,372
After many months, light returns
in earnest to the South Pole.

247
00:43:41,554 --> 00:43:43,689
But only momentarily.

248
00:43:45,117 --> 00:43:46,768
And yet...

249
00:43:46,951 --> 00:43:48,814
...it is enough.

250
00:44:01,962 --> 00:44:06,042
Their victory over winter has begun.

251
00:44:06,908 --> 00:44:11,012
Their efforts have not been in vain.

252
00:44:45,856 --> 00:44:48,379
Though the light is returning...

253
00:44:48,553 --> 00:44:51,631
...the winter is far from over.

254
00:44:56,198 --> 00:45:00,762
The worst is, actually, yet to come.

255
00:45:44,934 --> 00:45:48,496
No matter how cold it is.
or how hungry they are...

256
00:45:48,668 --> 00:45:50,732
...the fathers must keep moving.

257
00:45:51,505 --> 00:45:54,784
If they don't, they will die.

258
00:45:55,552 --> 00:45:57,345
But then....

259
00:46:56,414 --> 00:46:59,656
Each day more eggs will hatch.

260
00:46:59,837 --> 00:47:02,219
But this chick is hungry.

261
00:47:02,396 --> 00:47:05,710
He needs the food
in his mother's belly.

262
00:47:06,063 --> 00:47:08,103
But his father is hungry too.

263
00:47:08,276 --> 00:47:11,896
He hasn't eaten
in nearly four months now.

264
00:47:15,678 --> 00:47:19,924
If his mate doesn't arrive soon.
he will be forced to abandon his child...

265
00:47:20,107 --> 00:47:23,349
...and return to the sea
to feed himself.

266
00:47:25,572 --> 00:47:27,847
He will have no choice.

267
00:47:42,209 --> 00:47:47,291
But there is one secret weapon
against his newborn's hunger.

268
00:47:47,707 --> 00:47:51,233
The father coughs up a milky substance.

269
00:47:51,824 --> 00:47:55,349
Despite his own hunger.
this tiny meal has been relegated...

270
00:47:55,525 --> 00:47:57,837
...to a small crease in his throat...

271
00:47:58,015 --> 00:48:00,362
...just for this moment.

272
00:48:05,868 --> 00:48:10,880
This little banquet will keep the chick
alive for a day, perhaps two.

273
00:48:12,577 --> 00:48:16,233
Hopefully, long enough
for the mother to arrive.

274
00:48:17,316 --> 00:48:21,255
For some it is already too late.

275
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:16,917
The mothers step up their rhythm...

276
00:49:17,093 --> 00:49:19,098
...as if sensing the urgency.

277
00:50:06,244 --> 00:50:09,181
They shuffle along
as quickly as possible...

278
00:50:09,357 --> 00:50:13,567
...hauling their overstuffed bellies
one last mile.

279
00:50:13,750 --> 00:50:17,100
And then, at last, they are back.

280
00:51:03,903 --> 00:51:06,321
To find each other
in the enormous crowd...

281
00:51:06,499 --> 00:51:09,884
...the penguins must rely
on sound, not sight.

282
00:51:10,060 --> 00:51:13,822
As they circle.
the returning mothers trumpet loudly...

283
00:51:14,004 --> 00:51:16,870
...and wait for their mates
to call back.

284
00:51:45,756 --> 00:51:48,893
The sound is deafening.

285
00:51:49,078 --> 00:51:53,359
And yet, somehow, each of them
will hear their mate's song.

286
00:52:34,561 --> 00:52:37,320
The couple has found one another.

287
00:52:38,020 --> 00:52:41,475
The mother sees her chick
for the first time.

288
00:52:42,068 --> 00:52:43,896
And at last...

289
00:52:44,074 --> 00:52:46,314
...the family is together.

290
00:53:07,426 --> 00:53:09,738
And just as they did with the egg...

291
00:53:09,917 --> 00:53:14,517
...the parents now quickly pass off
the newborn from one to the other.

292
00:53:42,224 --> 00:53:47,436
Now it is the mother's turn to protect
her chick from the fierce cold.

293
00:53:58,444 --> 00:54:00,826
The father and his chick
sing to one another...

294
00:54:01,005 --> 00:54:04,590
...making sure
each knows the other's voice.

295
00:54:06,573 --> 00:54:11,267
It is the only way the two will find
each other when the father returns.

296
00:54:22,138 --> 00:54:26,384
As the chick enjoys his first real meal...

297
00:54:27,153 --> 00:54:31,092
...the father prepares to sever
the bond between them.

298
00:54:35,558 --> 00:54:38,011
It's not easy to do.

299
00:54:44,414 --> 00:54:47,622
The fathers have gone without food
for over four months.

300
00:54:48,805 --> 00:54:51,848
They will have lost
as much as half their weight.

301
00:54:52,022 --> 00:54:54,156
But still they must walk...

302
00:54:54,340 --> 00:54:57,382
...for over 70 miles.

303
00:54:58,733 --> 00:55:02,979
This leg of the journey may be why
they are fewer males than females.

304
00:55:03,265 --> 00:55:08,762
Each year some of these new fathers
will not make it back to the sea.

305
00:56:12,088 --> 00:56:16,747
Like the sun, the chicks
grow stronger every day.

306
00:57:25,836 --> 00:57:31,084
In time, after being perched atop their
mother's feet for a thousand paces...

307
00:57:31,267 --> 00:57:35,028
...like a child learning to dance
on her mother's shoes...

308
00:57:35,348 --> 00:57:38,968
...the chick takes
his first steps alone.

309
00:59:06,900 --> 00:59:09,105
With the wind's return...

310
00:59:09,287 --> 00:59:11,775
...the temperature drops.

311
00:59:12,227 --> 00:59:16,402
This year, winter's going out
with a bang.

312
01:00:17,876 --> 01:00:20,776
This is the first storm
for the new chicks...

313
01:00:20,955 --> 01:00:23,537
...and many of them will not survive it.

314
01:01:39,496 --> 01:01:41,559
When the winds stop...

315
01:01:41,745 --> 01:01:44,882
...the search for lost chicks begins.

316
01:01:46,725 --> 01:01:50,039
Some have kept warm
by huddling together.

317
01:01:50,668 --> 01:01:54,430
Others have not been so lucky.

318
01:02:07,860 --> 01:02:11,551
The loss is unbearable.

319
01:02:59,361 --> 01:03:03,371
Every year some bereft mother
will respond to her agony...

320
01:03:03,547 --> 01:03:06,307
...in an unimaginable way.

321
01:03:08,493 --> 01:03:10,533
Having lost her own chick...

322
01:03:10,707 --> 01:03:13,467
...she will attempt to steal another's.

323
01:03:22,641 --> 01:03:25,848
But the group will not allow it.

324
01:04:01,761 --> 01:04:06,903
Back in its mother's care.
the chick is not eager to leave again.

325
01:04:08,125 --> 01:04:10,990
Despite having known
each other only a few days...

326
01:04:11,169 --> 01:04:15,827
...the bond between mother
and child is surprisingly strong.

327
01:04:16,462 --> 01:04:18,360
In the next few weeks...

328
01:04:18,537 --> 01:04:21,060
...it will only grow stronger.

329
01:05:02,706 --> 01:05:05,017
Winter's grip slowly weakens...

330
01:05:05,197 --> 01:05:08,511
...and the chicks begin to run free.

331
01:05:31,587 --> 01:05:34,488
Some need a little encouragement.

332
01:05:35,981 --> 01:05:38,021
But eventually...

333
01:05:38,195 --> 01:05:40,647
...they all find their way.

334
01:07:51,661 --> 01:07:54,278
Winter may have ended...

335
01:07:56,054 --> 01:07:58,849
...but the dangers have not.

336
01:10:18,573 --> 01:10:20,849
It is late August now.

337
01:10:21,030 --> 01:10:25,453
And time for the mothers
to return and feed once more.

338
01:10:32,584 --> 01:10:34,034
For some...

339
01:10:34,208 --> 01:10:37,073
...this development is unacceptable.

340
01:10:40,123 --> 01:10:43,850
But it is also non-negotiable.

341
01:11:09,315 --> 01:11:12,488
Because they are old enough now...

342
01:11:13,362 --> 01:11:16,263
...the chicks are left alone
for the first time.

343
01:11:29,620 --> 01:11:30,999
As spring arrives...

344
01:11:31,175 --> 01:11:34,700
...the ice packs near the ocean's edge
begin to melt...

345
01:11:34,878 --> 01:11:38,604
...shortening the distance between
the sea and the breeding ground.

346
01:11:41,206 --> 01:11:44,520
It isn't long before the fathers return...

347
01:11:44,700 --> 01:11:47,223
...their bellies heavy with food.

348
01:11:59,468 --> 01:12:01,709
The chicks will gather at once
to meet them...

349
01:12:03,552 --> 01:12:05,592
...and sound their calls.

350
01:12:13,374 --> 01:12:17,761
The returning fathers will circle
the excited newborns and listen...

351
01:12:20,500 --> 01:12:23,472
...until he hears his chick's call.

352
01:12:36,617 --> 01:12:39,140
Some will never find their chick.

353
01:12:39,315 --> 01:12:42,075
The newborn will have died...

354
01:12:42,256 --> 01:12:45,428
...from cold or hunger...

355
01:12:45,611 --> 01:12:47,710
...or at the hands of some predator.

356
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:52,008
But for those
that do find their young...

357
01:12:52,182 --> 01:12:55,838
...the reunion is a joyful one.

358
01:12:59,549 --> 01:13:04,562
And, very quickly, the young chick's belly
will be full again.

359
01:13:16,361 --> 01:13:20,442
For the next several months.
the parents will take turns...

360
01:13:20,616 --> 01:13:24,755
...shuttling back and forth
to the sea for food.

361
01:13:44,101 --> 01:13:46,141
And occasionally...

362
01:13:46,488 --> 01:13:50,840
...the new family can actually
spend some time together.

363
01:14:36,700 --> 01:14:41,818
By September the ice has begun
to thin and crack.

364
01:14:42,821 --> 01:14:48,800
The sea gets closer, allowing the parents
to go back and forth more frequently.

365
01:14:54,202 --> 01:14:57,552
The chicks' new coat of feathers
is now thick and full...

366
01:14:57,729 --> 01:15:00,346
...enough to protect them on their own.

367
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:10,419
And by November the ocean is within
a few hundred yards...

368
01:15:10,596 --> 01:15:12,046
...of the breeding ground.

369
01:15:16,300 --> 01:15:18,022
As the ice melts...

370
01:15:18,618 --> 01:15:23,147
...the brand-new family prepares
to go their separate ways.

371
01:15:34,528 --> 01:15:39,021
The couples, locked for
the past nine months...

372
01:15:39,197 --> 01:15:42,299
...in their ancient ritual
of coming and going...

373
01:15:42,484 --> 01:15:46,211
...will now part for the last time.

374
01:15:51,995 --> 01:15:55,097
And as their newest members look on...

375
01:15:55,281 --> 01:15:59,905
...the tribe returns to their home, at last.

376
01:16:16,588 --> 01:16:18,486
For the next three months...

377
01:16:18,665 --> 01:16:22,532
...they will lavish in the rich and warmish
waters of their short summer.

378
01:16:22,711 --> 01:16:24,432
They will feed...

379
01:16:24,613 --> 01:16:26,157
...and they will play.

380
01:16:26,342 --> 01:16:28,476
And in all likelihood...

381
01:16:28,660 --> 01:16:31,597
...their chicks
will never see them again.

382
01:16:34,781 --> 01:16:39,993
They will remain here alone and
unsupervised for a few more weeks...

383
01:16:40,246 --> 01:16:41,826
...growing stronger.

384
01:16:49,725 --> 01:16:52,001
The ice continues to melt...

385
01:16:52,180 --> 01:16:55,670
...returning the borrowed water
to the sea.

386
01:17:01,243 --> 01:17:03,071
And beckoning the young penguins...

387
01:17:03,248 --> 01:17:06,149
...into the ocean as well.

388
01:17:24,900 --> 01:17:26,798
It is now December...

389
01:17:26,975 --> 01:17:30,537
...and they are ready to leave the place
where they were born.

390
01:17:32,026 --> 01:17:34,715
And although they have
never known the ocean...

391
01:17:34,931 --> 01:17:36,546
...nor touched it...

392
01:17:36,731 --> 01:17:39,561
...they, like their parents...

393
01:17:39,740 --> 01:17:42,016
...are of the sea.

394
01:17:49,148 --> 01:17:52,225
And so one day...

395
01:17:52,710 --> 01:17:55,434
...they'll take the plunge...

396
01:17:56,619 --> 01:18:00,181
...and go home for the first time.

397
01:18:32,799 --> 01:18:36,738
For four years.
the chicks will live at sea.

398
01:18:36,949 --> 01:18:41,088
But as the sunlight begins to disappear
at the end of their fifth year...

399
01:18:41,273 --> 01:18:43,890
...and the warm days begin to cool...

400
01:18:44,300 --> 01:18:47,342
...they, too, will climb out of the water.

401
01:18:47,516 --> 01:18:49,651
And they will march...

402
01:18:49,832 --> 01:18:52,320
...just as they have done for centuries...

403
01:18:52,495 --> 01:18:56,115
...ever since the emperor penguin
decided to stay...

404
01:18:56,301 --> 01:18:59,131
...to live and love...

405
01:18:59,310 --> 01:19:02,695
...in the harshest place on Earth.

406
