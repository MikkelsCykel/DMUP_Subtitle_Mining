00:03:06,128 --> 00:03:07,437
Boo-boo.

2
00:03:13,585 --> 00:03:15,951
Couldn't we read another book?

3
00:03:18,033 --> 00:03:20,172
We've read this one a hundred times.

4
00:03:21,235 --> 00:03:23,308
Please?

5
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:28,327
Nanny Gilbertine is so tired of
the Boo-boo book, she could just gag.

6
00:03:28,435 --> 00:03:30,410
Boo-boo.

7
00:03:32,178 --> 00:03:34,252
All right. All right.

8
00:03:37,013 --> 00:03:42,764
"One fine and sunny day,
Baby Boo's nanny Henrietta said

9
00:03:42,868 --> 00:03:48,401
'Baby Boo, today you shall go
on a wonderful adventure."'

10
00:03:48,469 --> 00:03:51,602
"'You will see the many,
many sights of the Big City."'

11
00:03:56,534 --> 00:04:00,145
"After a lovely breakfast
they walked down the lane to the corner,

12
00:04:00,213 --> 00:04:02,963
where they boarded a big, blue bus."

13
00:04:04,181 --> 00:04:06,549
"They were on their way to the Big City."

14
00:04:06,678 --> 00:04:09,428
"Baby Boo felt very grown-up indeed,

15
00:04:09,527 --> 00:04:13,006
for this was his first trip
away from Mother and Father."

16
00:04:15,222 --> 00:04:16,815
Did I tell you?

17
00:04:16,887 --> 00:04:21,197
- Baby's having his picture taken today.
- Oh. Say hello to old Willy for me.

18
00:04:22,263 --> 00:04:26,607
Old Willy isn't doing it.
I've hired Downtown Baby Photographers.

19
00:04:28,151 --> 00:04:31,219
He's photographed Cotwell babies
since the Depression.

20
00:04:31,289 --> 00:04:34,485
Old Willy hasn't had a picture
in the paper in over 20 years.

21
00:04:34,553 --> 00:04:37,520
Everyone we know has had
their baby's picture in the paper.

22
00:04:37,593 --> 00:04:40,823
Baby Bink is almost a year old
and virtually unknown.

23
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:46,586
I can't count the number of times I've been
asked why we're keeping our baby a secret.

24
00:04:48,315 --> 00:04:50,255
You're right.

25
00:04:50,362 --> 00:04:55,665
The only way to quiet such talk is to have our
small-minded friends open up their papers

26
00:04:55,771 --> 00:04:59,384
and see a photograph of
the prettiest baby in the city.

27
00:05:03,292 --> 00:05:07,088
- Get out! Come on!
- Come on, let's go. I said move it!

28
00:05:07,163 --> 00:05:08,987
Move it!

29
00:05:14,428 --> 00:05:17,877
Off with the fuzzy pink and blue sweaters,
nice and slow.

30
00:05:17,981 --> 00:05:21,014
- Ed, does it matter who wears pink or blue?
- No!

31
00:05:21,598 --> 00:05:24,946
Cotwell... Cotwell... Where is that little...

32
00:05:26,847 --> 00:05:29,017
Dinner with the Westfalls tonight.

33
00:05:29,118 --> 00:05:33,112
Don't forget to do your breathing exercises
Dr Phillips suggested.

34
00:05:33,183 --> 00:05:36,980
- I have a breathing scheduled at 11.
- Bless your soul.

35
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,708
Have a wonderful day.

36
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,852
Bing?

37
00:05:45,984 --> 00:05:47,957
What did you forget?

38
00:05:49,376 --> 00:05:52,192
Oh, my pen! Thank you, Andrews.

39
00:05:52,993 --> 00:05:54,999
What else?

40
00:05:56,001 --> 00:05:58,684
Darling, you know how
I hate games in the morning.

41
00:06:01,601 --> 00:06:04,220
Of course. Goodness, how could I forget?

42
00:06:04,514 --> 00:06:06,652
Don't you get...

43
00:06:06,753 --> 00:06:10,746
Don't you get into any mischief
while Dada's gone. Burble, burble.

44
00:06:10,817 --> 00:06:14,845
Won't it be exciting when he can understand
the wonderful things we say to him?

45
00:06:14,978 --> 00:06:17,532
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

46
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:49,692
He can't look too butch,
but he can't look too feminine.

47
00:06:49,766 --> 00:06:52,450
He has to look angelic, like a little prince.

48
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:55,331
That would suggest blue.

49
00:06:55,429 --> 00:06:59,588
Blue? Won't that look like we're trying to
match his eyes? Won't it be too obvious?

50
00:06:59,688 --> 00:07:02,819
I see lots of babies with
blue eyes and blue outfits.

51
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,789
What kind of babies?
Rich babies? Pretty babies?

52
00:07:05,862 --> 00:07:08,963
- Regular babies? Lmportant babies?
- Regular babies.

53
00:07:09,448 --> 00:07:11,935
Baby Bink is not a regular baby.

54
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,290
Buff, buff, buff, buff, buff.

55
00:07:21,354 --> 00:07:23,687
Oh, but how shiny they're getting.

56
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:35,009
Now, now. Hold still.

57
00:07:38,316 --> 00:07:41,510
Ready? Very, very handsome. Let me see.

58
00:08:10,412 --> 00:08:12,202
Hello.

59
00:08:14,286 --> 00:08:16,555
Get the gear.

60
00:08:17,231 --> 00:08:19,054
Get the gear.

61
00:08:19,121 --> 00:08:22,982
- He didn't say "Get the gear, Veeko."
- I'm the supervisor. You get it.

62
00:08:23,088 --> 00:08:26,120
You got the blue sweater.
You help me get the gear.

63
00:08:35,729 --> 00:08:39,589
A most pleasant and
charming good day to you, sir.

64
00:08:40,048 --> 00:08:43,245
I am Mr Charlie,

65
00:08:43,601 --> 00:08:49,383
photographer de babe,
entirely at your service.

66
00:08:53,298 --> 00:08:56,397
You were expecting us?

67
00:08:59,826 --> 00:09:02,282
- Thank you.
- Excuse me.

68
00:09:02,354 --> 00:09:04,779
Whoa, look at this place!

69
00:09:07,219 --> 00:09:09,007
Eddie.

70
00:09:17,044 --> 00:09:22,412
We ain't here to nick no bric-a-brac.
We're here for the hit of a lifetime.

71
00:09:22,517 --> 00:09:25,331
You wanna be a shoplifter, go to JC Penney.

72
00:09:33,526 --> 00:09:35,500
You think we can get away with this?

73
00:09:35,606 --> 00:09:39,349
No. I'm here because I've got
a wild curiosity about the electric chair.

74
00:09:40,087 --> 00:09:41,842
Sorry.

75
00:10:04,567 --> 00:10:06,990
What a gorgeous baby.

76
00:10:07,097 --> 00:10:09,366
You must be so proud.

77
00:10:10,168 --> 00:10:12,057
I'm Mrs Cotwell.

78
00:10:12,121 --> 00:10:13,779
I am Mr Charlie.

79
00:10:15,034 --> 00:10:16,856
Shall we begin?

80
00:10:29,436 --> 00:10:34,137
Mr Francis, if you will go to the vehicle
and retrieve my light meter.

81
00:10:42,812 --> 00:10:45,332
I'm going to be rich.

82
00:10:45,597 --> 00:10:48,183
I want individual photos of Baby Bink.

83
00:10:48,253 --> 00:10:51,701
Baby Bink? What
an absolutely delightful name.

84
00:10:51,805 --> 00:10:54,554
- It's a pet name for Bennington.
- Certainly.

85
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:58,583
I want individual photos of Baby Bink,
and then a portrait of the two of us.

86
00:10:58,655 --> 00:11:01,273
Whatever you wish, however you wish.

87
00:11:01,341 --> 00:11:04,211
You photographed
the children of many of my friends.

88
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:08,377
Those pictures are forever appearing
in newspapers and magazines.

89
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,454
It is true.

90
00:11:11,742 --> 00:11:15,191
- His picture's never been published.
- That cannot be.

91
00:11:15,264 --> 00:11:16,890
It's true.

92
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:23,353
I am sure in the not-so-distant future
this little fellow will be very well known.

93
00:11:25,087 --> 00:11:27,577
I want your very best. I want art.

94
00:11:27,681 --> 00:11:31,128
I want you to set a new standard
for beauty in baby photography.

95
00:11:31,553 --> 00:11:34,042
I so welcome the challenge, madame.

96
00:11:34,114 --> 00:11:38,654
And, to that end, may I ask one small favor?

97
00:11:38,723 --> 00:11:42,105
May I have some time alone with the child?

98
00:11:46,883 --> 00:11:49,534
Oh, I need his complete attention.

99
00:11:49,602 --> 00:11:55,387
The great bond between you and your son,
his love for you, will distract him.

100
00:11:55,492 --> 00:12:02,083
I need to study his marvelous little features,
to learn how best to photograph him.

101
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:07,844
He does well with persons
he is not intimate with?

102
00:12:11,494 --> 00:12:13,500
Does he?

103
00:12:14,309 --> 00:12:16,644
He's a friendly boy, but he may not like...

104
00:12:16,742 --> 00:12:18,465
Excellent!

105
00:12:18,886 --> 00:12:21,439
Madame, if I might make a suggestion.

106
00:12:22,022 --> 00:12:28,317
Your garment du jour, while
extremely magnificent, is so colorful,

107
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:31,207
I am afraid it will dominate the photograph

108
00:12:31,272 --> 00:12:34,686
and detract from your natural beauty.

109
00:12:36,551 --> 00:12:39,968
I knew this outfit was wrong.
I'll be back in 15 minutes.

110
00:12:40,648 --> 00:12:43,845
Take all the time you need.

111
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:50,429
If he gets cranky,

112
00:12:50,536 --> 00:12:52,642
read him his book.

113
00:12:52,713 --> 00:12:54,688
How invaluable.

114
00:12:56,361 --> 00:12:58,270
Thank you.

115
00:13:13,739 --> 00:13:16,040
Mr Andrews, get the winter wardrobe.

116
00:13:16,106 --> 00:13:18,528
- But, madam...
- Hurry, Gilbertine.

117
00:13:31,181 --> 00:13:33,352
There you go.

118
00:13:33,485 --> 00:13:35,459
Take the book.

119
00:13:46,445 --> 00:13:49,414
Bink really deserves this moment
in the spotlight.

120
00:13:49,487 --> 00:13:52,966
It's too bad the baby pictures
don't go on the front page.

121
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:55,148
- Ma'am?
- Yeah?

122
00:14:06,448 --> 00:14:08,423
We gotta make this fast.

123
00:14:27,409 --> 00:14:29,384
I'm sorry it took so long.

124
00:14:36,915 --> 00:14:38,923
Where's Bink?

125
00:15:27,065 --> 00:15:28,787
Eddie?

126
00:15:28,855 --> 00:15:33,012
You're a smart guy. How do you tell
the front from the back on these diapers?

127
00:15:33,081 --> 00:15:35,503
Are there pockets in the front?

128
00:15:38,073 --> 00:15:43,344
- Very funny. The front and back are the same.
- Then it probably don't make no difference.

129
00:15:43,738 --> 00:15:49,041
Put him in them regular baby clothes. That
fruit suit's a dead giveaway he's a rich kid.

130
00:15:50,459 --> 00:15:52,945
Come on. Good boy.

131
00:16:22,108 --> 00:16:23,898
Ed?

132
00:16:23,998 --> 00:16:27,161
How do I know this milk
won't burn the kid's throat?

133
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:29,171
If that matters.

134
00:16:29,245 --> 00:16:31,798
Try it on some skin first.

135
00:16:39,872 --> 00:16:41,945
What's the matter with you?

136
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:44,856
I better let it cool down.

137
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:50,619
You like that?

138
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:51,998
Eddie?

139
00:16:52,064 --> 00:16:54,073
Watch the baby.

140
00:16:59,712 --> 00:17:03,325
Very good. Now see if it works the other way.

141
00:17:09,922 --> 00:17:11,808
It works.

142
00:17:18,851 --> 00:17:20,639
Put him in the bedroom.

143
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:24,863
The more he sleeps, the less attention
he draws from the neighbors.

144
00:17:24,931 --> 00:17:27,616
- And keep an eye on him.
- Here you go, kid.

145
00:17:27,716 --> 00:17:30,815
That little doo-doo machine
is my retirement money.

146
00:17:31,939 --> 00:17:33,761
All right.

147
00:17:33,859 --> 00:17:35,932
Nappy-nap time, little jerk.

148
00:17:39,909 --> 00:17:42,013
Go to sleep real nice

149
00:17:42,116 --> 00:17:44,900
cos Mr Teddy Bear over here,

150
00:17:44,966 --> 00:17:48,861
he's been up all night drinking with
the Barbie dolls and he needs his rest.

151
00:17:49,222 --> 00:17:51,676
All right. Drink your milk.

152
00:17:51,748 --> 00:17:53,440
Take your nap.

153
00:17:54,566 --> 00:17:56,804
Drink your milk! Take your nap!

154
00:17:59,816 --> 00:18:01,822
- Eddie!
- What?

155
00:18:01,895 --> 00:18:05,922
You got any suggestions how you
get these things to eat and sleep?

156
00:18:06,472 --> 00:18:08,446
Sing him a song.

157
00:18:24,682 --> 00:18:30,432
~ Mary had a little lamb

158
00:18:32,392 --> 00:18:34,467
~ Little lamb

159
00:18:35,243 --> 00:18:37,217
~ Little lamb

160
00:18:37,995 --> 00:18:42,271
~ Mary had a little lamb

161
00:18:42,346 --> 00:18:45,544
~ Her hair was white as snow

162
00:18:46,508 --> 00:18:51,015
~ And every which way that Mary went

163
00:18:51,116 --> 00:18:53,505
~ The lamb was right behind her

164
00:18:54,443 --> 00:18:56,781
~ It followed her to work one day

165
00:18:56,878 --> 00:18:59,724
~ Work one day, work one day

166
00:18:59,788 --> 00:19:03,564
~ It followed her to work one day

167
00:19:03,629 --> 00:19:06,531
~ And Mary lost herjob

168
00:19:10,478 --> 00:19:13,444
Eddie! What else did Mary's little lamb do?

169
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:16,484
Didn't he put Humpty Dumpty
back together again?

170
00:19:17,774 --> 00:19:20,076
That was Nat King Cole.

171
00:19:20,142 --> 00:19:25,511
Nat King Cole stuck his finger in the pie
and yanked out the bird.

172
00:19:25,646 --> 00:19:30,436
How can a lamb put a Humpty
together again? He ain't got fingers.

173
00:19:30,638 --> 00:19:33,740
~ And then she went to unemployment...

174
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:37,834
Norby! Knock off the singin'
and read him his storybook.

175
00:19:39,601 --> 00:19:41,291
If you can.

176
00:19:46,576 --> 00:19:48,551
Wanna hear a story?

177
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,996
Let's see here. What do we got here?

178
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:03,980
"Nanny...

179
00:20:04,114 --> 00:20:06,025
and Baby Boo...

180
00:20:08,084 --> 00:20:10,058
strolled...

181
00:20:10,131 --> 00:20:12,139
through...

182
00:20:12,212 --> 00:20:14,666
the great big...

183
00:20:17,139 --> 00:20:19,028
de...

184
00:20:20,757 --> 00:20:22,731
de...

185
00:20:23,925 --> 00:20:26,991
- department.
...department store."

186
00:20:27,092 --> 00:20:30,772
"How many, many things there were to buy."

187
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:33,420
Or steal, if I was writin' that book.

188
00:20:34,293 --> 00:20:37,228
Or steal, if I was writin' this book.

189
00:21:10,649 --> 00:21:14,358
Mrs Cotwell? Dale Grissom, FBI.

190
00:21:14,458 --> 00:21:16,433
I'd like to ask you a few questions.

191
00:21:16,506 --> 00:21:18,709
You'll have to ask me later.

192
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:23,217
- I'm going to look for my baby.
- I'd rather you didn't. I need you here.

193
00:21:24,537 --> 00:21:26,928
- Don't coddle me, Mr Grissom.
- Mrs Cotwell,

194
00:21:27,004 --> 00:21:31,608
there are five million people in this city
and many places where your boy could be.

195
00:21:31,675 --> 00:21:36,213
It would be pointless and dangerous
for you to go out searching for your baby.

196
00:21:36,315 --> 00:21:40,722
I've been through a number of these cases.
I understand how you feel.

197
00:21:42,523 --> 00:21:44,913
Have you ever lost a child?

198
00:21:45,756 --> 00:21:47,164
No, ma'am.

199
00:21:47,516 --> 00:21:49,972
Then you can't possibly know how I feel.

200
00:21:52,093 --> 00:21:55,869
I apologize. But would you stay here, please?

201
00:21:56,351 --> 00:21:58,585
For your baby's sake.

202
00:23:36,774 --> 00:23:38,749
Do you gotta do that?

203
00:23:41,607 --> 00:23:43,584
I like to look nice.

204
00:23:44,232 --> 00:23:46,206
You gotta spit?

205
00:23:47,912 --> 00:23:51,938
I don't know about you,
but I don't eat pieces of my body.

206
00:24:23,532 --> 00:24:25,353
What?

207
00:24:26,156 --> 00:24:28,546
- What did I do?
- You spit on me.

208
00:24:28,621 --> 00:24:30,693
- I did not!
- Somebody did,

209
00:24:30,764 --> 00:24:32,969
and you're the only one in the room.

210
00:24:48,429 --> 00:24:50,404
You jerk!

211
00:24:50,478 --> 00:24:53,479
What? No, no. Quiet.

212
00:24:53,582 --> 00:24:56,429
- You're gonna wake up the baby.
- The baby's on the roof!

213
00:25:09,073 --> 00:25:11,854
Hurry. Come on, hurry.

214
00:25:32,593 --> 00:25:34,382
Eddie!

215
00:25:37,298 --> 00:25:39,687
Ed. Hey, Ed, what happened?

216
00:25:40,787 --> 00:25:42,413
Eddie, are you OK?

217
00:25:46,067 --> 00:25:49,680
- People shouldn't leave this lying around.
- What are you doing, dope?

218
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:51,885
It was in the way.

219
00:25:52,659 --> 00:25:54,515
- What happened?
- Right, pick him up.

220
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:56,587
Eddie. Ed, you're drooling.

221
00:25:56,660 --> 00:26:01,518
- Eddie, come on. Come on, Ed. Come on.
- Eddie, what happened? Eddie?

222
00:26:02,038 --> 00:26:04,013
What? This way?

223
00:26:06,134 --> 00:26:08,719
Oh, great. It's gotta be at least 1,000 feet.

224
00:26:08,789 --> 00:26:11,660
- Ed, we're gonna have to jump.
- We're gonnajump?

225
00:26:11,766 --> 00:26:15,082
- Yes. On three. Ready?
- OK.

226
00:26:15,222 --> 00:26:16,237
One.

227
00:26:16,373 --> 00:26:17,902
Two.

228
00:26:18,038 --> 00:26:18,966
Three.

229
00:26:26,871 --> 00:26:29,173
Eddie!

230
00:26:50,938 --> 00:26:53,272
Ed, look...

231
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:55,192
out!

232
00:27:19,421 --> 00:27:22,170
- What?
- Package.

233
00:27:22,589 --> 00:27:26,900
- Where do you want me to sign?
- Anywhere's fine.

234
00:27:33,726 --> 00:27:36,115
Have a nice... day.

235
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:38,166
You old bat.

236
00:27:41,213 --> 00:27:44,063
- Which way?
- This way.

237
00:27:57,249 --> 00:27:59,355
Ed!

238
00:27:59,425 --> 00:28:02,108
Are you all right?

239
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:05,494
How can he be all right?
The guy fell off a building.

240
00:28:05,601 --> 00:28:10,357
Probably got contusions, concussions,
contractions. What's the matter with you?

241
00:28:29,093 --> 00:28:32,889
- Just take it easy. How you feelin'?
- Eddie, how many fingers I got up?

242
00:28:32,964 --> 00:28:35,834
- Two.
- Not you! Hey, Eddie, say somethin'.

243
00:28:35,909 --> 00:28:39,040
- Here, put him here.
- Sit down on the bench. Sit down.

244
00:28:39,364 --> 00:28:41,253
You OK?

245
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:42,910
Eddie.

246
00:28:42,982 --> 00:28:44,770
When we first seen you fall,

247
00:28:44,837 --> 00:28:49,540
our first thoughts were with you
and your family, should you not survive.

248
00:28:49,668 --> 00:28:51,971
- I prayed, Eddie.
- Shut up!

249
00:29:13,062 --> 00:29:16,412
All right, take it easy.
You wanna maybe get to the right of him.

250
00:29:22,632 --> 00:29:24,805
Wait, Eddie. We don't wanna get a ticket.

251
00:29:29,032 --> 00:29:32,230
- Get to the right. Eddie, get to the right.
- Shut up!

252
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:37,257
Move in front of him. I'll jump on the back.

253
00:29:37,322 --> 00:29:39,809
- You're makin' me nuts!
- OK. Don't get crazy.

254
00:29:43,851 --> 00:29:46,850
- Just drive. I'll tell you.
- See that lady over there?

255
00:29:46,922 --> 00:29:49,738
There he is! I see him! There he is!

256
00:29:50,507 --> 00:29:52,482
We got him.

257
00:29:54,058 --> 00:29:56,067
He's gone! We lost him!

258
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:06,054
Look both ways!

259
00:30:07,757 --> 00:30:09,130
I think you hit a cat.

260
00:30:09,196 --> 00:30:13,354
Here's the bus. Eddie, you see it?
He's gettin' ahead of us, Eddie.

261
00:30:13,453 --> 00:30:15,657
There's the bus again.

262
00:30:20,269 --> 00:30:22,692
Driver, next stop, please.

263
00:30:37,137 --> 00:30:38,762
Wait, I don't see him.

264
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,015
- There's the bus.
- I see the bus!

265
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,056
I'll get him!

266
00:30:50,929 --> 00:30:53,263
Wait! Wait! Stop the bus.

267
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,369
I forgot somethin'! Stop the bus!

268
00:30:56,466 --> 00:30:59,761
Wait, wait, wait! Hello! Stop the bus!

269
00:30:59,827 --> 00:31:04,050
Halt! Stop the bus! Wait! Stop the bus!

270
00:31:08,468 --> 00:31:12,624
Did a baby get off this bus?
A little guy, about two feet tall.

271
00:31:12,723 --> 00:31:16,039
- It's an emergency!
- I didn't have nobody today with a baby.

272
00:31:16,243 --> 00:31:18,382
He was by himself!

273
00:31:21,684 --> 00:31:24,105
- What?
- He must have got off.

274
00:31:24,885 --> 00:31:27,121
Oh, great. We're through.

275
00:31:30,805 --> 00:31:33,652
If you didn't park your van on the sidewalk,

276
00:31:33,717 --> 00:31:36,620
people could get by a lot easier.

277
00:31:39,445 --> 00:31:44,336
If you'd limit yourself to a couple of pork
roasts a day, you wouldn't need to worry.

278
00:31:44,917 --> 00:31:46,293
You heard me.

279
00:31:52,952 --> 00:31:54,960
Some people.

280
00:31:58,039 --> 00:32:00,528
- Eddie, how could he get off?
- I seen him.

281
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:03,218
- What?
- He's in the big broad's purse.

282
00:32:04,119 --> 00:32:09,304
Yeah, this is Carl in 157.
You know anything about a missing baby?

283
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:12,983
I see her. How could you miss her?
She's as big as a building.

284
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:16,280
- Eddie, let me do this.
- Will you stop it?

285
00:32:16,345 --> 00:32:20,469
- How do we do it?
- Nonchalant. We'll give her a sandwich.

286
00:32:20,538 --> 00:32:24,336
- She don't need a sandwich. Look at her.
- That's my whole point.

287
00:32:24,412 --> 00:32:26,645
Wait.

288
00:32:42,971 --> 00:32:44,347
Eddie.

289
00:32:44,444 --> 00:32:46,418
Get her, Veeko! You get her, Veeko!

290
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:54,298
Get her, Veeko. You got her, Veek.
Hang in there, Veek. You got her! Come on!

291
00:32:54,524 --> 00:32:55,605
Who's next?

292
00:32:57,021 --> 00:33:01,396
How about you, Mr Comedy?
"We'll give her a sandwich," huh?

293
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:04,220
"As big as a building," huh?

294
00:33:04,287 --> 00:33:07,734
Not so easy making jokes
with my fist in your mouth, is it?

295
00:33:07,837 --> 00:33:10,619
- I'm not afraid of you.
- Come on. She's crazy.

296
00:33:10,717 --> 00:33:13,402
Anybody else wanna take a shot?

297
00:33:18,175 --> 00:33:20,151
Chicken!

298
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:05,952
How did you get out of
Mother Goose Corner?

299
00:34:20,003 --> 00:34:22,908
So, you got a nasty little surprise for me?

300
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:31,327
You guys are worthless!

301
00:34:31,397 --> 00:34:33,636
Yeah, right, Eddie. Blame us.

302
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:38,559
- You know, I'm gettin' sick of your insults.
- Then why don't you quit?

303
00:34:38,632 --> 00:34:43,203
- Oh, yeah? Let you two have all the money?
- What money? The kid is gone!

304
00:34:43,783 --> 00:34:46,152
There you go, my little escape artist.

305
00:34:50,215 --> 00:34:54,820
Now, if you were a baby
lost in the big city, where would you go?

306
00:35:17,322 --> 00:35:21,829
,, speculation, but a ransom figure
in the millions of dollars was mentioned,

307
00:35:21,932 --> 00:35:26,983
Security is tight around the Cotwell mansion
and at Cotwell Industry Towers downtown,

308
00:35:27,084 --> 00:35:29,572
Ronnie Lee has more on the story, Ronnie?

309
00:35:29,676 --> 00:35:32,546
There's no word from police,
but our sources tell us

310
00:35:32,652 --> 00:35:37,093
that a nine-month-old baby boy was abducted
at approximately ten o'clock this morning,

311
00:35:37,198 --> 00:35:40,230
We have confirmed that
a photographer and two assistants

312
00:35:40,332 --> 00:35:42,855
from the Downtown
Baby Photographers studio

313
00:35:42,927 --> 00:35:46,755
were scheduled to photograph
the missing child today,

314
00:35:46,861 --> 00:35:49,961
A spokesman for the photography
studio declined to comment,

315
00:36:15,407 --> 00:36:21,967
,, extremely tight, In fact, police
and FBI units have sealed off the area,

316
00:36:22,193 --> 00:36:26,470
Earlier I attempted to reach millionaire
Bennington Cotwell at his office.

317
00:36:26,866 --> 00:36:32,169
Though reporters were turned away,
a reliable source informed us that Cotwell...

318
00:36:35,697 --> 00:36:38,929
A spokesman for the company said
that Mr Cotwell was unavailable.

319
00:36:43,891 --> 00:36:48,114
Hang on a second. Keep rolling. OK.

320
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:09,747
Where'd he go?

321
00:37:29,464 --> 00:37:31,504
We're always, like, this close.

322
00:37:46,231 --> 00:37:48,852
- Hello.
- Hello, Is this Mr Cotwell?

323
00:37:48,954 --> 00:37:53,012
- Yes. Who is this?
- My name's Depke, Joe, Joe Depke,

324
00:37:53,114 --> 00:37:58,549
Yeah, Listen, I might have some information
on the whereabouts of that child,

325
00:38:08,122 --> 00:38:10,579
- I seen the baby.
- Where?

326
00:38:10,683 --> 00:38:12,691
Right across the street on the curb.

327
00:38:12,764 --> 00:38:14,705
Where'd he go?

328
00:38:17,308 --> 00:38:20,471
It's the craziest thing. I don't remember.

329
00:38:20,572 --> 00:38:23,356
Maybe we'll take a ride.
See if you remember then.

330
00:38:23,454 --> 00:38:26,770
- You want money? How much?
- Don't embarrass me. Don't insult me.

331
00:38:26,877 --> 00:38:30,138
- Your money's no good here. Put it away.
- Where's the baby?

332
00:38:30,204 --> 00:38:32,245
House across the street.

333
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:35,318
Second floor.

334
00:38:36,798 --> 00:38:40,442
McCrays. No guarantee.
Listen, mister, I didn't know your kid.

335
00:38:40,543 --> 00:38:42,549
I just saw his picture on TV.

336
00:38:43,678 --> 00:38:46,068
I called because I care.

337
00:38:54,271 --> 00:38:57,402
- Your name's McCray?
- Yeah. What did I do?

338
00:38:57,471 --> 00:39:00,189
We're looking for a missing child.

339
00:39:00,287 --> 00:39:03,486
- These are my kids.
- Mind if we take a look?

340
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:09,784
Hello, ma'am.

341
00:39:15,201 --> 00:39:17,469
Hi.

342
00:39:19,330 --> 00:39:21,306
Sir, in here.

343
00:39:32,357 --> 00:39:33,916
Baby.

344
00:39:59,399 --> 00:40:01,374
You have a beautiful little boy.

345
00:40:04,231 --> 00:40:06,207
Thank you, ma'am.

346
00:40:07,527 --> 00:40:09,534
I'll pray he comes back to you.

347
00:40:11,208 --> 00:40:15,812
These kids are all I've got, so I know
how I'd feel if I was in your place.

348
00:40:16,872 --> 00:40:18,846
I hope you never are.

349
00:40:20,777 --> 00:40:22,979
For your children's sake.

350
00:40:32,297 --> 00:40:34,304
Sorry we inconvenienced you.

351
00:40:35,466 --> 00:40:37,439
Be there in a second.

352
00:40:40,649 --> 00:40:43,617
- I'm sorry for the trouble.
- Sir?

353
00:40:44,713 --> 00:40:50,432
I believe in my heart that someone
somewhere watches over the babies.

354
00:40:53,322 --> 00:40:55,462
Yes, I hope so.

355
00:41:00,554 --> 00:41:02,923
You have everything? Are you sure?

356
00:41:23,597 --> 00:41:28,038
I can't believe this. You know,
it ain't the wisest strategy to kidnap a baby

357
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:30,828
and then let the damn thing
loose on the streets.

358
00:41:30,927 --> 00:41:35,149
Babies crawling in traffic tend
to draw attention, don't you think?

359
00:41:44,399 --> 00:41:47,849
To the left, I think. You see? The cab.

360
00:41:58,386 --> 00:42:00,394
Got you now, you little...

361
00:42:07,570 --> 00:42:10,440
- Eddie!
- My money!

362
00:42:22,133 --> 00:42:24,915
Come on! Come on! Go! Go!

363
00:42:28,757 --> 00:42:30,666
Go! No, wait!

364
00:42:32,533 --> 00:42:34,323
Stay! Stay there!

365
00:42:34,422 --> 00:42:36,395
Stay there!

366
00:42:37,301 --> 00:42:38,708
Don't go!

367
00:42:39,764 --> 00:42:41,937
Go! Now! Watch your feet.

368
00:42:45,206 --> 00:42:46,613
Stay there!

369
00:42:46,677 --> 00:42:50,061
OK, hang on. One, two, three - go.

370
00:43:05,847 --> 00:43:10,933
I worked at Burger King three years.
This is worse than that.

371
00:43:11,032 --> 00:43:15,026
Don't blame me. We'd be restin' easy
if Butterfingers here hadn't lost the kid.

372
00:43:15,097 --> 00:43:18,774
I lost the kid? I lost the kid?
Oh, well, that's news to me.

373
00:43:18,874 --> 00:43:22,385
- Who fell asleep reading nursery stories?
- Who left the window open?

374
00:43:25,017 --> 00:43:28,335
- That was me.
- You idiots are why we don't got the kid.

375
00:43:28,410 --> 00:43:34,107
As far as I'm concerned, you can drop out and
I'll keep the $5m. You don't deserve a penny.

376
00:43:34,171 --> 00:43:36,755
- You'd stiff us?
- Wait a minute!

377
00:43:36,826 --> 00:43:41,530
Don't get hot, Eddie. Don't get hot.
We're all just tired from gettin' torn apart.

378
00:43:42,044 --> 00:43:46,299
Like I like to fall off buildings
and jump in ditches! That's the breaks.

379
00:43:46,364 --> 00:43:48,251
We're dealing with a baby.

380
00:43:48,316 --> 00:43:51,828
Babies are obviously
more dangerous than we thought.

381
00:43:51,899 --> 00:43:54,552
It don't figure, Eddie. They're so small.

382
00:43:54,622 --> 00:43:57,970
When I boxed, the guys I most feared
were those who feared nothin'.

383
00:43:58,045 --> 00:44:01,273
Babies are like that -
they ain't afraid of nothin'.

384
00:44:05,022 --> 00:44:06,713
Baby tracks.

385
00:44:26,110 --> 00:44:28,349
Norby, hey.

386
00:45:27,334 --> 00:45:30,083
The kid's in the gorilla cage.

387
00:45:32,390 --> 00:45:34,758
There goes our five million bucks, huh?

388
00:45:36,870 --> 00:45:38,943
I think the ape likes the kid.

389
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:53,092
- What?
- You got long arms.

390
00:45:55,495 --> 00:45:57,406
Thanks.

391
00:46:04,234 --> 00:46:06,121
I can't reach him, Eddie.

392
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:10,851
That's it. You got it.

393
00:46:16,010 --> 00:46:18,018
Easy does it.

394
00:46:18,635 --> 00:46:21,985
That's it. Slow, slow, slow. There.

395
00:46:22,091 --> 00:46:23,683
Easy.

396
00:46:43,916 --> 00:46:46,307
Nice monkey.

397
00:46:47,342 --> 00:46:48,836
Yes.

398
00:46:50,062 --> 00:46:53,225
He's startin' to cry, Eddie.
He'll make the monkey mad.

399
00:46:55,950 --> 00:46:57,380
Eddie, he's gettin' up.

400
00:46:57,999 --> 00:47:01,927
- I'm afraid, Eddie.
- Freeze. Just stare him down.

401
00:47:07,248 --> 00:47:09,256
That's it.

402
00:47:37,459 --> 00:47:38,668
Shut up!

403
00:48:30,103 --> 00:48:32,592
Hey, King Kong. Hey, over here.

404
00:48:33,337 --> 00:48:35,440
I'm a banana.

405
00:48:35,575 --> 00:48:39,472
I'm a coconut. I'm an entire fruit salad.

406
00:48:39,801 --> 00:48:42,418
Over here. Hey, look. I'm the Jungle Boy.

407
00:48:42,519 --> 00:48:45,935
Over here. That's it.

408
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:48,495
Now you got it.

409
00:48:50,873 --> 00:48:52,499
I got him.

410
00:48:56,921 --> 00:48:58,677
I got him.

411
00:49:02,139 --> 00:49:04,790
Bad monkey.

412
00:50:51,205 --> 00:50:53,179
- Eddie?
- Careful, Eddie.

413
00:52:16,556 --> 00:52:18,563
Eddie.

414
00:52:20,173 --> 00:52:22,597
I know you don't wanna hear this, but...

415
00:52:25,613 --> 00:52:27,589
the kid's gone again.

416
00:53:25,460 --> 00:53:29,170
This morning all I wanted
was my baby's picture in the paper.

417
00:53:36,212 --> 00:53:38,252
I got my wish.

418
00:53:41,557 --> 00:53:43,530
Where's your mommy?

419
00:54:17,466 --> 00:54:20,532
Hey, Eddie, maybe
he went down a rabbit hole.

420
00:54:20,633 --> 00:54:24,660
We're serious about our work.
You wanna make jokes, join the circus.

421
00:54:27,385 --> 00:54:29,173
Bozo.

422
00:54:37,211 --> 00:54:40,210
Step on it, Eddie. Baby, starboard side.

423
00:54:41,242 --> 00:54:42,617
- Starboard.
- What?

424
00:54:42,715 --> 00:54:44,723
- Port.
- What is that?

425
00:54:44,829 --> 00:54:46,202
- Point!
- Nine o'clock!

426
00:54:46,267 --> 00:54:49,050
- Where is he?
- Over here at 6:30.

427
00:54:51,004 --> 00:54:52,214
Step on it.

428
00:54:54,011 --> 00:54:56,435
You're ours now, moneybags.

429
00:55:06,431 --> 00:55:09,561
Did Baby Bink miss his Uncle Eddie?

430
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:14,645
- Come here.
- Get him.

431
00:55:17,503 --> 00:55:19,892
- Did you get him?
- No! Come on!

432
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:32,599
Where'd he go?

433
00:55:32,671 --> 00:55:35,672
He went down a rabbit hole.

434
00:55:37,470 --> 00:55:42,209
- Don't let those rabbits chew your face off.
- Shut up, Veeko. Just shut up!

435
00:55:43,841 --> 00:55:48,990
No problem, fellas. It ain't a hole,
it's a tunnel. And what's every tunnel got?

436
00:55:49,056 --> 00:55:51,742
Don't tell me. I know, I know. It's a...

437
00:55:52,547 --> 00:55:54,650
Toll booth at the end.

438
00:55:54,721 --> 00:55:58,432
Are you always this stupid,
or do you do this just to annoy me?

439
00:55:58,531 --> 00:56:03,322
A tunnel has two ends.
This one's here, and the other one's...

440
00:56:03,429 --> 00:56:05,730
Where? Come on.

441
00:56:19,076 --> 00:56:22,274
- Eddie, Eddie, Eddie.
- Get him, Norby. Get him.

442
00:56:22,340 --> 00:56:25,439
- Don't let him get away.
- Here he is, Eddie.

443
00:56:27,526 --> 00:56:30,592
Today ain't your lucky day, eh, shorty-pants?

444
00:56:32,453 --> 00:56:34,786
That wasn't so hard.

445
00:57:10,856 --> 00:57:14,241
- Beautiful day, huh?
- You know anything about that vehicle?

446
00:57:19,626 --> 00:57:22,146
Yes. It belongs to us.

447
00:57:22,217 --> 00:57:24,041
You left the engine running.

448
00:57:24,330 --> 00:57:25,858
Yes.

449
00:57:25,962 --> 00:57:27,905
I did.

450
00:57:27,979 --> 00:57:31,556
I've been having battery trouble.

451
00:57:32,554 --> 00:57:36,005
We just stopped by to admire the beauti...

452
00:57:38,125 --> 00:57:41,419
beautiful flowers.

453
00:57:48,972 --> 00:57:51,842
Have you guys seen a baby around here?

454
00:57:52,045 --> 00:57:54,020
The park is full of...

455
00:57:55,725 --> 00:57:59,075
- babies.
- Yeah, well, there's been a kidnapping.

456
00:57:59,182 --> 00:58:01,572
Well, that's a cryin' shame.

457
00:58:01,902 --> 00:58:04,521
It's amazing what people will do for money.

458
00:58:04,591 --> 00:58:06,565
Yeah, for five million...

459
00:58:07,693 --> 00:58:09,767
If we see anything...

460
00:58:13,614 --> 00:58:15,306
Excuse me.

461
00:58:16,081 --> 00:58:20,075
If we see anything, we'll be sure to notify...

462
00:58:48,244 --> 00:58:50,283
He's got a bad heart.

463
00:58:59,187 --> 00:59:01,163
Excuse me.

464
00:59:03,636 --> 00:59:05,610
The police.

465
00:59:06,389 --> 00:59:08,299
Thank you.

466
00:59:11,989 --> 00:59:16,779
Walk 'em to the car. My entire reproductive
system is about to go up in flames.

467
00:59:22,550 --> 00:59:24,917
Is that a Fleetline van?

468
00:59:27,254 --> 00:59:29,230
Eddie, is it?

469
00:59:30,232 --> 00:59:32,686
- Yes!
- Yes, it is.

470
00:59:32,791 --> 00:59:34,830
I thought so.

471
00:59:34,935 --> 00:59:37,718
My brother drives one
for a dry-cleaning firm.

472
00:59:37,816 --> 00:59:40,337
Oh, yeah, they drive a lot of those.

473
00:59:40,409 --> 00:59:42,797
He's always had a lot of trouble with his.

474
00:59:42,872 --> 00:59:48,241
Give me a second, I'll think of what he said
is the problem with the electrical system.

475
00:59:48,345 --> 00:59:50,319
- Alternator?
- No.

476
00:59:50,392 --> 00:59:52,695
- Carburetor?
- No.

477
00:59:54,136 --> 00:59:57,137
- There's this little relay thing.
- Veeko!

478
00:59:57,209 --> 00:59:59,249
Veeko.

479
00:59:59,322 --> 01:00:02,583
I think you should move the van.

480
01:00:02,682 --> 01:00:04,854
I have a frog in my throat.

481
01:00:06,523 --> 01:00:09,971
And a brush fire in my undershorts.
Get 'em outta here.

482
01:00:10,043 --> 01:00:14,451
It's just a bad battery. I think we should
move it before the engine dies.

483
01:00:14,525 --> 01:00:19,282
Yeah, it's just the battery.
Let's get it outta here. Come on, let's...

484
01:00:28,700 --> 01:00:30,839
You sure can tell summer's here.

485
01:00:30,941 --> 01:00:33,308
People got those barbecues goin'.

486
01:00:37,085 --> 01:00:41,078
- Smells great, doesn't it?
- Come on, let's go move the van.

487
01:00:48,287 --> 01:00:50,109
I'll be right with you.

488
01:00:52,991 --> 01:00:55,708
I just have a cramp in my leg.

489
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:11,390
Take it easy.

490
01:01:51,204 --> 01:01:53,474
That's how you put out campfires.

491
01:01:53,637 --> 01:01:56,734
Is that a fact?

492
01:01:56,837 --> 01:01:58,812
Used to do it in Boy Scouts.

493
01:02:00,582 --> 01:02:03,396
You toasted your marshmallows

494
01:02:03,462 --> 01:02:07,204
over a pile of flaming gonads?

495
01:02:08,390 --> 01:02:10,529
We usually used logs.

496
01:02:12,007 --> 01:02:13,917
Follow that kid!

497
01:02:13,990 --> 01:02:16,641
We'll meet you on the other side.

498
01:02:16,711 --> 01:02:19,493
I'm sorry, man, but it was an emergency.

499
01:02:19,558 --> 01:02:22,560
- You were blazin' pretty hard...
- Shut up!

500
01:02:31,176 --> 01:02:33,184
Oh, boy, Eddie.

501
01:02:33,290 --> 01:02:36,071
You got burnt clear through your skivvies.

502
01:02:38,408 --> 01:02:41,027
Baby Bink! It's your mother!

503
01:02:41,097 --> 01:02:42,625
Baby Bink!

504
01:02:42,731 --> 01:02:45,577
I'll kill him.

505
01:03:23,790 --> 01:03:25,928
I'm sorry, ma'am.

506
01:03:31,630 --> 01:03:34,020
I haven't forgotten your feelings.

507
01:03:36,302 --> 01:03:38,309
My feelings don't matter.

508
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:51,528
Yes, they do.

509
01:03:52,305 --> 01:03:54,247
They do very much.

510
01:03:56,496 --> 01:03:59,661
The love my baby's gotten
has been as much yours as mine.

511
01:04:03,281 --> 01:04:05,257
Probably more.

512
01:04:11,921 --> 01:04:13,897
Where's my little boy?

513
01:04:16,947 --> 01:04:19,183
What's he doing?

514
01:04:23,315 --> 01:04:27,145
If he were home,
he'd be going down for his nap.

515
01:07:22,117 --> 01:07:24,321
I got bad news.

516
01:07:24,389 --> 01:07:26,428
The kid's...

517
01:07:27,397 --> 01:07:29,372
in there.

518
01:07:29,861 --> 01:07:31,835
No, wait. Eddie, there's a guard.

519
01:07:31,973 --> 01:07:34,757
Eddie, no. Eddie, wait. No.

520
01:07:34,855 --> 01:07:37,985
- There's a guard.
- He's asleep, you moron.

521
01:07:40,103 --> 01:07:44,642
Where is he? Come on,
knucklehead. Where is he, huh?

522
01:07:51,080 --> 01:07:53,086
Of course.

523
01:07:53,351 --> 01:07:55,391
Where else would he be?

524
01:08:00,168 --> 01:08:02,144
Let's go get him.

525
01:08:31,692 --> 01:08:33,862
Eddie.

526
01:08:33,963 --> 01:08:35,872
Baby, 12 o'clock.

527
01:08:39,659 --> 01:08:41,187
Up there.

528
01:08:47,084 --> 01:08:49,671
We'll be with you in just a minute.

529
01:08:55,533 --> 01:08:59,528
Lingerie, home furnishings,
men's hats, babies.

530
01:09:01,743 --> 01:09:06,150
- Wait a minute. We passed him.
- Yes, moron. We'll grab him as he goes by.

531
01:09:06,222 --> 01:09:09,866
Yeah, that's a good plan, Ed.
We grab him as he comes by.

532
01:09:09,934 --> 01:09:11,943
You grab him.

533
01:09:12,688 --> 01:09:14,661
- I grab him?
- Right.

534
01:09:15,791 --> 01:09:19,021
As the girder comes up,
you jump out on it and grab the baby.

535
01:09:19,088 --> 01:09:23,082
- Me? By myself?
- You just step out on it. It ain't difficult.

536
01:09:23,568 --> 01:09:26,186
- Why me?
- Norby's scared of heights.

537
01:09:26,320 --> 01:09:28,777
- Why don't you grab him?
- Nobody asked me!

538
01:09:38,066 --> 01:09:40,914
OK, OK. That's it.

539
01:09:40,979 --> 01:09:43,148
- Come on, don't miss him.
- I'll get it.

540
01:09:43,216 --> 01:09:45,193
Don't miss it. He's coming.

541
01:09:46,803 --> 01:09:51,658
- All right. Don't grab, OK?
- I'm not touching you. There it is. Go!

542
01:10:02,963 --> 01:10:04,874
Here he comes.

543
01:10:08,789 --> 01:10:11,056
How'd he do that?

544
01:10:12,405 --> 01:10:14,380
Baby luck.

545
01:10:27,255 --> 01:10:29,587
Eddie! Help me!

546
01:10:31,191 --> 01:10:34,420
- He asked for you, Ed.
- He ain't thinkin' straight.

547
01:10:34,487 --> 01:10:36,691
- Don't look down.
- What are you doin'?

548
01:10:36,759 --> 01:10:41,014
- Eddie, no! I'm gonna faint!
- Didn't I tell you not to look down?

549
01:10:41,111 --> 01:10:43,381
- Pull me back, please!
- I'm losing my grip.

550
01:10:43,448 --> 01:10:46,164
- Pull me back, please.
- Grab him by the leg.

551
01:10:46,264 --> 01:10:48,436
Grab him by the leg or I'll let you go!

552
01:10:48,504 --> 01:10:51,089
Don't look down.

553
01:10:51,160 --> 01:10:53,071
OK, good. You got him.

554
01:10:57,914 --> 01:10:59,287
Up!

555
01:11:02,265 --> 01:11:04,917
You're going the wrong way! Come up!

556
01:11:04,986 --> 01:11:07,703
- Rest on my feet.
- I could use a hand here!

557
01:11:07,801 --> 01:11:10,672
Hey, quit being a crybaby. Get up.

558
01:11:15,963 --> 01:11:18,746
You're doin' good, but you gotta get back up.

559
01:11:18,811 --> 01:11:21,112
- I'm losin' him, Eddie.
- Quit foolin' around.

560
01:11:21,211 --> 01:11:22,805
Gimme a hand.

561
01:11:26,396 --> 01:11:27,770
What's the matter with you?

562
01:11:41,502 --> 01:11:42,929
Ed?

563
01:11:45,054 --> 01:11:47,442
- Eddie?
- Get off of me.

564
01:11:56,608 --> 01:11:58,997
There he is.

565
01:11:59,071 --> 01:12:01,493
Come on, we'll take the stairs.

566
01:12:55,013 --> 01:12:57,117
It's comin' back down. Get ready.

567
01:13:00,454 --> 01:13:03,268
- Now, jump.
- I'll wait for another.

568
01:13:03,333 --> 01:13:05,405
No, don't wait. Jump.

569
01:13:05,540 --> 01:13:07,516
Jump!

570
01:13:33,064 --> 01:13:34,853
My...

571
01:13:34,921 --> 01:13:36,709
spine.

572
01:14:44,209 --> 01:14:46,825
- I lived.
- Get back up here!

573
01:14:54,897 --> 01:14:57,416
Come here, you little ball of grief!

574
01:15:00,177 --> 01:15:03,974
Now I gotcha! You ain't
gonna crawl away from this one.

575
01:15:32,565 --> 01:15:34,058
That hurt!

576
01:16:06,903 --> 01:16:08,725
That's it!

577
01:16:09,560 --> 01:16:12,177
No mercy!

578
01:16:16,376 --> 01:16:21,461
This ain't no nursery-school
battle of wits anymore.

579
01:16:21,751 --> 01:16:26,968
This is my five foot, ten inches
of guile, gut and gristle

580
01:16:27,033 --> 01:16:32,499
versus your two and a half feet
of goo-goos, ga-gas and giggles.

581
01:16:36,506 --> 01:16:39,190
If the Mil...

582
01:16:46,201 --> 01:16:48,886
If the Milwaukee Mob couldn't kill me,

583
01:16:48,987 --> 01:16:54,835
no milk-puking little thumb-sucker's
got a candle's chance in a cyclone

584
01:16:54,941 --> 01:16:57,079
of gettin' the better of me.

585
01:17:02,075 --> 01:17:04,051
Where are you going?

586
01:17:08,028 --> 01:17:09,817
Come back here.

587
01:17:12,733 --> 01:17:15,962
This isn't funny anymore.

588
01:17:19,069 --> 01:17:21,436
My money!

589
01:19:17,033 --> 01:19:18,659
What?

590
01:19:18,729 --> 01:19:21,414
I thought I saw a baby
crawl around the corner.

591
01:19:23,625 --> 01:19:25,600
Good night, Donald.

592
01:20:00,364 --> 01:20:02,341
Norby!

593
01:20:03,439 --> 01:20:05,347
Veeko!

594
01:20:06,764 --> 01:20:09,865
Ed! We're down here!

595
01:20:17,455 --> 01:20:19,463
Hey, Ed!

596
01:20:21,391 --> 01:20:23,725
We better go before I dry!

597
01:20:24,625 --> 01:20:27,439
Ed, can you see the baby from up there?

598
01:20:28,368 --> 01:20:32,143
Just hang on and we'll come on up.
I got an idea.

599
01:20:42,482 --> 01:20:46,257
We got some news. I don't know
if it's good, but it's not bad.

600
01:20:46,354 --> 01:20:49,104
Since the media broke the story,
calls have come in.

601
01:20:49,298 --> 01:20:52,714
There was a report of a man
looking for a baby on a bus this morning.

602
01:20:53,075 --> 01:20:56,205
A baby missing from
a department store care center.

603
01:20:57,457 --> 01:21:00,143
Another, at three o'clock, at the zoo.

604
01:21:00,212 --> 01:21:03,986
Shortly after that at a downtown park.
And a final report not long ago at...

605
01:21:04,052 --> 01:21:07,466
- A building under construction.
- Yeah, that's right.

606
01:21:09,941 --> 01:21:12,111
He's doing everything in the book.

607
01:21:16,853 --> 01:21:18,826
I know where he is.

608
01:21:19,892 --> 01:21:22,163
"Before returning home for supper,

609
01:21:22,230 --> 01:21:27,664
Nanny and Baby Boo stopped at
the Old Soldiers' Home to visit Mr Tinsel."

610
01:21:27,765 --> 01:21:30,132
That's where he is.

611
01:22:25,083 --> 01:22:27,057
Come on over.

612
01:22:28,187 --> 01:22:31,037
It's the kid, on television! The one that...

613
01:22:36,348 --> 01:22:39,032
Come on. That's it. Come on.

614
01:22:54,399 --> 01:22:58,108
~ This is the army, Mr Jones

615
01:22:58,174 --> 01:23:01,971
~ No private rooms or telephones

616
01:23:02,078 --> 01:23:05,374
~ You had your breakfast in bed before

617
01:23:05,438 --> 01:23:09,848
~ But you won't get it there anymore

618
01:23:09,952 --> 01:23:13,595
~ This is the army, Mr Brown

619
01:23:13,663 --> 01:23:16,861
~ You and your baby went to town

620
01:23:17,314 --> 01:23:20,696
~ She had you worried, but this is war

621
01:23:20,769 --> 01:23:24,631
~ And she won't worry you anymore

622
01:23:24,834 --> 01:23:28,315
~ No, she won't worry you

623
01:23:28,419 --> 01:23:32,030
~ Anymore

624
01:23:48,546 --> 01:23:50,522
Baby.

625
01:24:12,902 --> 01:24:15,107
You had quite an adventure today.

626
01:24:15,208 --> 01:24:16,996
Boo-boo.

627
01:24:19,686 --> 01:24:23,516
- Boo-boo?
- It's what he calls his book. He lost it today.

628
01:24:23,622 --> 01:24:26,938
We'll get you another one, sweetheart.

629
01:24:29,960 --> 01:24:31,236
What?

630
01:24:33,127 --> 01:24:34,787
What?

631
01:24:34,857 --> 01:24:37,410
Oh, I see. That's nice.

632
01:24:38,824 --> 01:24:41,890
That's not a boo-boo.
That's a clock. A ticktock.

633
01:24:41,961 --> 01:24:44,861
- Was there a ticktock in his book?
- No.

634
01:24:47,337 --> 01:24:49,792
Well, he's pointing to...

635
01:24:51,530 --> 01:24:55,686
His boo-boo. He's not pointing
at the ticktock. He wants his boo-boo.

636
01:24:55,753 --> 01:25:00,457
- I thought he was getting a new boo-boo.
- He means his boo-boo's back there.

637
01:25:02,026 --> 01:25:07,394
Radio Rogers and McCloskey. Tell them we're
going to the ticktock to get the boo-boo.

638
01:25:07,467 --> 01:25:09,289
And send for backup.

639
01:25:59,920 --> 01:26:05,190
Hey, Eddie, you sure you don't wanna
go check to see if they left the money?

640
01:26:05,296 --> 01:26:07,753
Oh, that's a good idea.

641
01:26:07,826 --> 01:26:10,957
We get the living hell
tore out of us by a baby!

642
01:26:11,122 --> 01:26:15,693
Three fully grown men versus
15 pounds of pink flesh with a mouth.

643
01:26:15,953 --> 01:26:21,420
What chance have we got of strolling into
that alley and coming out with anything less

644
01:26:21,490 --> 01:26:23,912
- than 140 years in prison?
- No way.

645
01:26:23,986 --> 01:26:25,994
No, thank you!

646
01:26:26,067 --> 01:26:30,323
This is a hexed situation.
We walk away while we're still ahead.

647
01:26:30,419 --> 01:26:33,136
We took a lickin' and kept on tickin'.

648
01:26:33,203 --> 01:26:34,862
We'll go back to banks.

649
01:26:35,123 --> 01:26:38,386
Dealing with grownups.
I don't want no kiddy stuff.

650
01:26:38,484 --> 01:26:42,641
- We did all right with banks.
- Or a convenience store once in a while.

651
01:26:42,741 --> 01:26:49,451
You know, one thing I learned from all this:
I ain't never gonna have any kids of my own.

652
01:26:51,476 --> 01:26:56,715
Yeah, seeing as you burnt down the only tree
in your forest, I wouldn't worry about it.

653
01:26:59,030 --> 01:27:00,753
Why don't you shut up?

654
01:27:01,205 --> 01:27:05,997
I don't wanna ever hear another word
about that rotten, snake-bit baby.

655
01:27:08,439 --> 01:27:10,032
I'm serious!

656
01:27:15,159 --> 01:27:17,649
I'm hearing that little vermin in my thoughts.

657
01:27:17,721 --> 01:27:20,054
I wanna erase him from my mind.

658
01:27:22,776 --> 01:27:24,815
Did you hear that?

659
01:27:25,720 --> 01:27:28,689
- Yeah.
- You know what it sounds like?

660
01:27:46,139 --> 01:27:48,407
He's back.

661
01:28:10,204 --> 01:28:12,790
You dirty, no-good little stool pigeon!

662
01:28:12,893 --> 01:28:16,155
You're surrounded. Throw down the boo-boo.

663
01:28:20,861 --> 01:28:23,447
And put your hands over your heads.

664
01:29:05,250 --> 01:29:07,225
This is the end of the story.

665
01:29:32,772 --> 01:29:34,628
Good night, sweetheart.

666
01:29:35,269 --> 01:29:37,244
Good night, Bink.

667
01:29:44,997 --> 01:29:49,089
Did I tell you? The baby's
having his picture taken tomorrow,

668
01:29:49,190 --> 01:29:52,037
- Say hello to old Willy,
- I will,

669
01:30:14,404 --> 01:30:17,705
Babys trip to China

670
01:30:25,099 --> 01:30:35,568
THE END
