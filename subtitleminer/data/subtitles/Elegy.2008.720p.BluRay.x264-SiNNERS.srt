1
00:00:26,633 --> 00:00:29,133
- We're not all descended from the Puritans.
- No?

2
00:00:29,467 --> 00:00:32,217
There was another colony,
30 miles from Plymouth.

3
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:34,883
It's not on the maps today.
Merrymount.

4
00:00:35,342 --> 00:00:36,758
Ah, right,
you mentioned in your book...

5
00:00:36,925 --> 00:00:38,842
The colony where anything goes... went.

6
00:00:39,217 --> 00:00:40,675
There was booze...

7
00:00:40,675 --> 00:00:42,217
There was booze, fornication,
there was music...

8
00:00:42,467 --> 00:00:44,342
They even...

9
00:00:45,342 --> 00:00:46,342
you name it...

10
00:00:46,925 --> 00:00:49,800
They even danced round the Maypole
once a month, wearing masks,

11
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:53,133
worshiping god knows what, Whites and
Indians together all going for broke.

12
00:00:53,508 --> 00:00:55,092
Who was responsible for all of this?

13
00:00:55,967 --> 00:00:58,217
A character by the name of
Thomas Morton.

14
00:00:59,092 --> 00:01:01,675
Ah... The Hugh Hefner of the Puritans.

15
00:01:02,383 --> 00:01:03,883
You can say that.

16
00:01:04,383 --> 00:01:07,217
I will read you a quote of what the
Puritans thought of

17
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:09,175
Morton's followers.

18
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:12,550
"Debauched aliens and atheists
falling into great licentiousness

19
00:01:12,883 --> 00:01:15,342
and leading degenerate lives. "

20
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:19,050
When I heard that, I packed my bags,
I left Oxford, I came straight to America.

21
00:01:19,425 --> 00:01:20,675
America the licentious.

22
00:01:21,008 --> 00:01:23,175
So what happened
to all of those people?

23
00:01:23,508 --> 00:01:26,467
The Puritans shut them down,
they sent in Miles Standish,

24
00:01:26,675 --> 00:01:29,383
Leading the militia, who chopped down the
Maypole, cut down those coloured ribbons,

25
00:01:29,717 --> 00:01:32,217
Banners everything.
The party was over.

26
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:36,217
And we became a nation of
strait-laced Puritans.

27
00:01:36,675 --> 00:01:38,092
Well...

28
00:01:38,717 --> 00:01:40,300
Isn't that your point though?

29
00:01:40,633 --> 00:01:42,258
The Puritans won.

30
00:01:43,342 --> 00:01:45,967
They stamped out, all things sexual
How would you say?

31
00:01:46,342 --> 00:01:48,550
- Sexual happiness.
- Exactly.

32
00:01:49,758 --> 00:01:50,758
Until the 1960's.

33
00:01:51,175 --> 00:01:54,092
Until the 1960's, where it all
exploded again all over the place.

34
00:01:54,717 --> 00:01:56,925
Right, everyone was dancing

35
00:01:57,258 --> 00:01:58,967
around the Maypole,

36
00:01:59,467 --> 00:02:02,092
then, "make love, not war".

37
00:02:02,508 --> 00:02:04,342
If you remember,
only a decade earlier,

38
00:02:04,717 --> 00:02:07,800
If you wanted to have sex,
if you wanted to make love in the 1950s,

39
00:02:08,133 --> 00:02:10,383
You had to beg for it,
you had to cop a feel...

40
00:02:10,717 --> 00:02:12,800
Or get married.

41
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:14,800
As I did in the 1960's.

42
00:02:16,842 --> 00:02:17,967
Any regrets?

43
00:02:18,842 --> 00:02:20,092
Plenty.

44
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:22,008
But that's my secret.

45
00:02:22,508 --> 00:02:24,717
Don't tell anybody.

46
00:02:25,092 --> 00:02:27,008
That's just between you and me.

47
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:40,800
I think it was Bette Davis who said:

48
00:02:41,133 --> 00:02:43,467
"Old age is not for sissies"

49
00:02:45,925 --> 00:02:48,758
But it was Tolstoy who said that

50
00:02:48,758 --> 00:02:51,550
"the biggest surprise in
a man's life is old age".

51
00:02:53,258 --> 00:02:55,467
Old age sneaks up on you,

52
00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:00,383
and the next thing you know you're
asking yourself, I'm asking myself,

53
00:03:00,717 --> 00:03:03,175
Why can't an old man act his real age?

54
00:03:03,592 --> 00:03:05,300
How is it possible for
me to still be involved

55
00:03:05,675 --> 00:03:08,550
in the carnal aspects of the human comedy?

56
00:03:08,967 --> 00:03:12,425
Because, in my head,
nothing has changed.

57
00:03:34,675 --> 00:03:37,258
Her name was Consuela Castillo

58
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:39,842
and she was my student.

59
00:03:52,508 --> 00:03:55,092
This course is called
"Practical Criticism".

60
00:03:56,925 --> 00:03:58,425
So... Let's go!

61
00:03:59,092 --> 00:04:01,050
Right to the big question, shall we?

62
00:04:01,592 --> 00:04:03,508
Does "War and Peace"

63
00:04:03,842 --> 00:04:07,092
become a different book
because we read it?

64
00:04:07,717 --> 00:04:10,258
Yes, of course.
But why?

65
00:04:12,592 --> 00:04:15,300
Because we bring something to the book?

66
00:04:15,717 --> 00:04:17,425
We bring ourselves.

67
00:04:17,842 --> 00:04:21,300
What's more, if you read the book again
in 10 years, it will change again,

68
00:04:21,592 --> 00:04:23,217
because you've changed.

69
00:04:23,592 --> 00:04:26,217
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.

70
00:04:26,592 --> 00:04:29,008
I've always been vulnerable
to female beauty,

71
00:04:29,383 --> 00:04:32,342
Ms. Castillo was different,
her posture was perfect.

72
00:04:32,633 --> 00:04:34,758
And she dressed like a
young associate

73
00:04:35,175 --> 00:04:38,425
of a prestigious law firm.
There was a sophistication,

74
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,175
that set her apart.

75
00:04:40,717 --> 00:04:42,717
She knows she's beautiful.

76
00:04:43,592 --> 00:04:46,467
But she's not yet sure what
to do with her beauty.

77
00:04:47,092 --> 00:04:49,050
No, don't take notes.
Because honestly, it's not worth it.

78
00:04:49,425 --> 00:04:51,550
Really, don't give it a thought.

79
00:04:53,925 --> 00:04:57,342
A work of art reminds you of
who you are now.

80
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:02,300
Since they posted the sexual harassment
hotline number down the hall from my office,

81
00:05:02,675 --> 00:05:05,050
I never make private contact
with any of my students

82
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:07,383
until they've received their grades.

83
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:10,008
Afterwards I always throw a cocktail party

84
00:05:10,383 --> 00:05:11,800
for the class.

85
00:05:11,967 --> 00:05:13,508
And it's always a success.

86
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,842
Professor Kepesh,
we saw you on TV last night.

87
00:05:22,842 --> 00:05:24,842
You were great.

88
00:05:25,217 --> 00:05:27,300
Thank you. Charlie Rose was pretty
good too wasn't he?

89
00:05:27,967 --> 00:05:29,800
Well, yes.

90
00:05:30,425 --> 00:05:32,842
- You were great.

91
00:05:33,258 --> 00:05:34,883
- Have a lovely evening.
- Thank you.

92
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,925
It's a colossus of perspective. It depends
on who's observing, right professor Kapesh?

93
00:05:39,633 --> 00:05:41,675
Westerners see Islamic integralists as

94
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,592
primitive and dangerous while,

95
00:05:44,008 --> 00:05:46,217
Islamic integralists see
Americans as depraved and corrupt.

96
00:05:47,342 --> 00:05:51,175
Nothing's changed since the crusades.
We need an alliance of civilizations...

97
00:05:51,675 --> 00:05:53,550
- Ms. Castillo.
- Hi, professor.

98
00:05:54,425 --> 00:05:56,592
- Is this a real letter from Kafka?
- Yes.

99
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:59,592
Yes, it's one of the original letters

100
00:05:59,883 --> 00:06:02,300
that he wrote to Milena.
It was a gift from someone.

101
00:06:02,675 --> 00:06:03,842
Someone close to you.

102
00:06:04,217 --> 00:06:05,508
Someone who was close
to me, Miss Castillo.

103
00:06:05,508 --> 00:06:06,675
Consuela.

104
00:06:07,092 --> 00:06:09,133
We're not in class.
We don't need to be so formal.

105
00:06:09,467 --> 00:06:10,717
Consuela.

106
00:06:13,008 --> 00:06:14,967
- Do you play the piano?
- Yeah.

107
00:06:16,342 --> 00:06:17,467
Would you play for us?

108
00:06:17,967 --> 00:06:20,383
Too many people.
I'd freeze.

109
00:06:23,092 --> 00:06:27,717
You know there's something about you
that invites a kind of formality.

110
00:06:28,967 --> 00:06:30,425
What do you mean?

111
00:06:30,925 --> 00:06:33,467
You have a kind of elegant austerity.

112
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,258
Austerity?

113
00:06:36,675 --> 00:06:37,925
Something like that.

114
00:06:38,342 --> 00:06:40,342
Well, I guess I got that from my father.

115
00:06:40,758 --> 00:06:42,258
He is austere...

116
00:06:42,633 --> 00:06:44,967
and proud.
Very Cuban.

117
00:06:45,383 --> 00:06:46,758
Cuban?

118
00:06:47,175 --> 00:06:48,467
My whole family is Cuban.

119
00:06:48,883 --> 00:06:50,675
I was 11 years old when I came.

120
00:06:51,217 --> 00:06:53,008
Did you go straight to college
from high school?

121
00:06:53,842 --> 00:06:56,925
No, I was a legal secretary
in a law firm.

122
00:06:57,925 --> 00:06:59,092
You worked.

123
00:06:59,508 --> 00:07:01,217
I tried it, but I didn't like it.

124
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:04,258
My parents always hoped
I would go to college,

125
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:07,383
So I made up my mind
and here I am.

126
00:07:11,842 --> 00:07:13,633
I want to show you something.

127
00:07:16,633 --> 00:07:19,050
- Here we are.
- Goya.

128
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:24,967
- What's this one called?
- "La Maja Vestida."

129
00:07:26,258 --> 00:07:27,675
And?

130
00:07:28,508 --> 00:07:30,800
- And?
- She resembles you.

131
00:07:31,258 --> 00:07:32,633
You resemble her.

132
00:07:34,425 --> 00:07:36,217
Really?

133
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:38,467
Yes.

134
00:07:38,925 --> 00:07:40,383
I think so.

135
00:07:43,467 --> 00:07:44,758
What do you think?

136
00:07:45,342 --> 00:07:46,883
I don't know.

137
00:07:50,425 --> 00:07:52,092
The eyes, maybe.

138
00:07:56,258 --> 00:07:59,592
Why all this talk about Kafka,
Goya and her Cuban family?

139
00:08:00,008 --> 00:08:03,508
Don't get me wrong, it's great that her
family's Cuban and she enjoys my class.

140
00:08:03,925 --> 00:08:07,092
But I go on yakking away mainly
because I want to fuck her.

141
00:08:08,217 --> 00:08:09,758
- What can I say?
- True.

142
00:08:10,217 --> 00:08:11,800
The room is full of spies.

143
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,800
I love music.

144
00:08:15,717 --> 00:08:17,592
Excuse me.

145
00:08:19,258 --> 00:08:22,217
I love opera, my grandfather
takes me to the Opera,

146
00:08:22,842 --> 00:08:24,717
And I adore theater.

147
00:08:25,675 --> 00:08:28,258
I review plays for a magazine.

148
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:31,258
Would you like to go with me
sometime to the theater?

149
00:08:33,175 --> 00:08:35,008
- Yes.
- Sorry.

150
00:08:37,633 --> 00:08:39,258
Go to the theater?

151
00:08:39,717 --> 00:08:42,383
- Why don't you take her to the prom?
- I get it.

152
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,550
This girl is...

153
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:48,800
She's a throw-back to a completely
different time. She has to be wooed.

154
00:08:49,258 --> 00:08:51,550
I thought we were talking about sex.

155
00:08:52,133 --> 00:08:54,092
You know for a Pulitzer Prize winning poet,

156
00:08:54,425 --> 00:08:56,508
sometimes you display a
remarkable lack of imagination.

157
00:08:56,967 --> 00:08:59,050
That's why they gave me the fucking prize.

158
00:08:59,425 --> 00:09:03,050
Don't tell me you've never been
through the process of talking the talk.

159
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:07,008
That's why I have a family for
Christ's sake. I talk to them.

160
00:09:07,383 --> 00:09:08,925
Maybe you should get married again.

161
00:09:09,175 --> 00:09:10,883
George!

162
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,133
Talk the talk with your wife if you
feel like it, go to the museums,

163
00:09:18,508 --> 00:09:20,467
look at all the Goyas that you want,

164
00:09:20,883 --> 00:09:22,508
but keep the sex part just for sex.

165
00:09:24,717 --> 00:09:26,050
Alright.

166
00:09:28,967 --> 00:09:31,800
Do you really still talk
to your wife, George?

167
00:09:32,592 --> 00:09:34,633
No. One all.

168
00:09:39,508 --> 00:09:40,717
I'm not hitting that.

169
00:10:38,717 --> 00:10:40,633
Sneaking off for a smoke?

170
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,842
- You know you shouldn't smoke.
- You tell me that

171
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:47,217
in this bed, every 3 weeks.

172
00:10:48,758 --> 00:10:51,800
- I'm under a lot of pressure.
- I like to be consistent.

173
00:10:52,383 --> 00:10:53,758
So do I.

174
00:10:54,508 --> 00:10:57,092
You've been trying to get me
to quit smoking for 20 years.

175
00:10:57,092 --> 00:10:59,633
Since the first day of your class.

176
00:11:00,092 --> 00:11:02,592
Oh my God, your class made me smoke.

177
00:11:06,633 --> 00:11:08,133
I'm under a lot of stress.

178
00:11:08,633 --> 00:11:10,508
- Oh, how was Chicago?
- Cleveland.

179
00:11:10,842 --> 00:11:13,925
Chicago was last week.
Atlanta's next week.

180
00:11:14,383 --> 00:11:16,133
You sound like Cary Grant

181
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:21,717
in "North by Northwest".
Ha, ha, ha. Ha, ha!

182
00:11:22,258 --> 00:11:25,592
Ha ha, laugh, just try being a
woman running your own business.

183
00:11:25,925 --> 00:11:27,925
I thought you liked
being your own boss.

184
00:11:27,925 --> 00:11:30,008
I do. Oh, I do, I do.

185
00:11:32,133 --> 00:11:34,842
Thank god for these little interludes.

186
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:36,717
That's all I can say.

187
00:11:47,758 --> 00:11:48,925
Aren't you going to get that?

188
00:11:49,383 --> 00:11:52,092
There's only one person in the world that
would call me at 2 o'clock in the morning

189
00:11:52,717 --> 00:11:54,008
Leave a message.

190
00:11:55,383 --> 00:11:58,092
Did you get my email?
I really need to talk to you.

191
00:12:01,467 --> 00:12:03,758
Ah, I should have known better than
to think you'd be home at this hour.

192
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:07,217
Or maybe you are home and listening

193
00:12:07,758 --> 00:12:09,633
to this, all snug and smug.

194
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:14,300
35 years old and he still hates my guts.

195
00:12:14,717 --> 00:12:16,258
Well, you ran out on him.

196
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:18,467
I ran out on a marriage that
I got myself into out of youth

197
00:12:18,467 --> 00:12:20,425
and fear a million years ago.

198
00:12:20,758 --> 00:12:21,925
Sometimes you pay for liberation.

199
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,550
That's the price he pays
for being turned into

200
00:12:23,967 --> 00:12:25,717
the heroic...

201
00:12:26,342 --> 00:12:28,008
defender of the abandoned mother.

202
00:12:28,425 --> 00:12:30,508
I mean if any one of us
could make it over the wall.

203
00:12:31,008 --> 00:12:32,550
He sat on my case,

204
00:12:32,967 --> 00:12:35,300
isn't there some statute of limitations?
I've tried.

205
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,008
Really, I've tried.

206
00:12:38,717 --> 00:12:40,300
When he was 12 or 13 one time,

207
00:12:40,758 --> 00:12:42,467
he came to spend the summer
with me, I took him to the Mets.

208
00:12:42,758 --> 00:12:45,925
He spent the next five innings
throwing up in the men's room,

209
00:12:46,258 --> 00:12:47,675
he's been throwing up ever since,
that phone call was him throwing up.

210
00:12:47,675 --> 00:12:49,175
You know what's wild?

211
00:12:49,467 --> 00:12:50,675
He's successful.

212
00:12:51,092 --> 00:12:52,467
Kenny Kepesh,

213
00:12:52,883 --> 00:12:55,342
A well respected doctor,
my son, the doctor.

214
00:12:55,717 --> 00:12:58,592
He speaks passable French,
he's married with children.

215
00:12:59,008 --> 00:13:02,342
It's only with me that he
regresses to what you just heard.

216
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,675
I'm sorry, he gets me going.

217
00:13:11,633 --> 00:13:13,550
I thought you stopped reviewing plays.

218
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:15,883
Well, that one looked
kind of interesting.

219
00:13:19,258 --> 00:13:20,925
Too bad I'm going to be in Atlanta.

220
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,967
I'll go with George.

221
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:25,967
Religion, family,

222
00:13:26,342 --> 00:13:28,967
Church, self-help books.

223
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:32,050
Men with teeth so white you'd think
there's a flashlight in their mouths.

224
00:13:32,425 --> 00:13:35,217
Love, especially romantic love.

225
00:13:36,967 --> 00:13:39,633
Flowers, mini-malls.

226
00:13:40,092 --> 00:13:43,050
There is nothing more
depressing than a mini-mall.

227
00:13:43,217 --> 00:13:45,217
- Mini-malls.
- Except perhaps

228
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:50,092
your flaws, your vices,
your mortgages,

229
00:13:51,175 --> 00:13:54,342
your furtive looks to your
sleeping BlackBerry

230
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,425
- I do like blackberries.
- And this man,

231
00:13:56,925 --> 00:14:01,633
who finds himself here,
dandruff falling of his head.

232
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:04,800
That was wonderful.

233
00:14:06,092 --> 00:14:07,467
I'm glad you enjoyed it.

234
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,175
Thank you.

235
00:14:11,758 --> 00:14:13,883
You'd like to go somewhere for a drink?

236
00:14:17,175 --> 00:14:19,133
We don't have to...

237
00:14:22,092 --> 00:14:25,592
I'm just not used to being
out with a celebrity.

238
00:14:26,008 --> 00:14:28,175
Talking about literature on
public television once a week,

239
00:14:28,175 --> 00:14:30,258
and writing the occasional review

240
00:14:30,592 --> 00:14:33,217
for the New Yorker, doesn't
make me much of a celebrity.

241
00:14:33,717 --> 00:14:38,217
Don't forget your history books
"The Origins of American Hedonism."

242
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,800
Look, if you don't like the
idea of being stared at,

243
00:14:42,258 --> 00:14:44,092
We can go to my place.

244
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:46,967
Then the only person
staring would be me.

245
00:14:55,967 --> 00:14:59,383
If I go to your place will you
do something for me?

246
00:15:53,967 --> 00:15:55,092
That was awful.

247
00:15:55,592 --> 00:15:59,300
It was OK.
That was amazing.

248
00:16:00,133 --> 00:16:02,217
I wish I could play.

249
00:16:02,675 --> 00:16:03,883
Take lessons.

250
00:16:04,383 --> 00:16:06,508
You'd enjoy playing if

251
00:16:06,508 --> 00:16:08,633
you knew you wouldn't have such
a high opinion of my playing.

252
00:16:09,092 --> 00:16:11,008
Now you're fishing for compliments.

253
00:16:11,383 --> 00:16:13,133
Is this a metronome?

254
00:16:13,633 --> 00:16:15,842
It's like a heart beat.

255
00:16:16,258 --> 00:16:17,633
Even...

256
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:21,967
great pianists have a problem
with their core acceleration.

257
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:31,050
You're a very charming man.

258
00:16:33,175 --> 00:16:35,217
You know, don't you?

259
00:16:35,842 --> 00:16:41,008
If this is all for showing you a metronome,
I swear I didn't invent it.

260
00:17:11,217 --> 00:17:15,592
Can you find anyone that
enchanting without sex?

261
00:17:16,342 --> 00:17:18,425
Nobody.

262
00:17:22,008 --> 00:17:23,300
What is this?

263
00:17:25,092 --> 00:17:26,717
My dark room.

264
00:17:29,217 --> 00:17:31,383
I used to develop my own pictures.

265
00:17:31,883 --> 00:17:34,342
- You don't anymore?
- No, no time.

266
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:40,008
I should go digital, but I can't
really understand that stuff.

267
00:17:41,925 --> 00:17:43,467
Of course you can.

268
00:17:44,967 --> 00:17:46,050
Thank you.

269
00:17:54,425 --> 00:17:57,633
Something relates little princess
because she's...

270
00:17:57,967 --> 00:18:00,008
the center of the picture,

271
00:18:00,425 --> 00:18:04,133
Not her parents,
The queen and the king.

272
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,883
They are just...

273
00:18:07,467 --> 00:18:09,883
ghostly reflections in the mirror.

274
00:19:32,717 --> 00:19:36,008
Well she must have been curious
about going to bed with you.

275
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:38,342
Yes, so she could tell
her girlfriends

276
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:41,425
what a man of our age,

277
00:19:41,967 --> 00:19:43,217
is like, close up.

278
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,383
I'm merely an experience for her.
One of many to come.

279
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,592
She'll remember me as...

280
00:19:49,008 --> 00:19:52,092
the old guy who gave her
some culture on the way.

281
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:54,342
Well, that sounds about right.

282
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,967
You should chalk it up to
the same thing, right?

283
00:19:58,133 --> 00:19:59,675
Yeah.

284
00:20:00,925 --> 00:20:04,175
Gotta stop worrying about growing old.

285
00:20:04,633 --> 00:20:07,133
Worry about growing up.

286
00:20:09,592 --> 00:20:13,925
Oh, thank your lucky stars for
such a one-shot encounter.

287
00:20:15,217 --> 00:20:17,342
It wasn't a one-shot encounter.

288
00:20:19,383 --> 00:20:21,425
She came back for more?

289
00:21:04,133 --> 00:21:06,925
You have the most beautiful
breasts I've ever seen.

290
00:21:10,717 --> 00:21:11,925
You like them?

291
00:21:13,883 --> 00:21:15,467
I worship them.

292
00:21:24,425 --> 00:21:26,342
And you have a beautiful face,

293
00:21:28,675 --> 00:21:31,258
I can't stop looking at.

294
00:21:32,050 --> 00:21:33,675
You know something?

295
00:21:37,383 --> 00:21:39,425
You're a work of art.

296
00:21:43,592 --> 00:21:45,508
A work of art.

297
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:53,592
A real work of art.

298
00:22:11,133 --> 00:22:12,758
Let's talk about you.

299
00:22:16,342 --> 00:22:17,925
Have you had many women?

300
00:22:19,092 --> 00:22:20,300
Why?

301
00:22:21,008 --> 00:22:23,800
More than 50 or less?

302
00:22:25,633 --> 00:22:26,758
More.

303
00:22:28,467 --> 00:22:29,967
Who's counting?

304
00:22:31,967 --> 00:22:33,425
How about you?

305
00:22:35,383 --> 00:22:36,800
Not many.

306
00:22:37,217 --> 00:22:38,425
How many?

307
00:22:54,050 --> 00:22:55,175
Five.

308
00:22:56,967 --> 00:22:58,467
Five boyfriends.

309
00:22:59,633 --> 00:23:00,800
Five.

310
00:23:01,342 --> 00:23:02,633
Five.

311
00:23:06,092 --> 00:23:07,383
I see.

312
00:23:10,383 --> 00:23:11,842
So, who were they?

313
00:23:12,175 --> 00:23:14,508
They were young, right?
Younger than me?

314
00:23:14,883 --> 00:23:18,342
Of course they were younger.
They were boys.

315
00:23:18,925 --> 00:23:20,383
Boys?

316
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:22,508
Sure.

317
00:23:28,592 --> 00:23:32,675
You want to know the most
extreme thing I ever did?

318
00:23:33,425 --> 00:23:34,925
Hmm well...

319
00:23:35,592 --> 00:23:38,842
Once I went to bed
with two guys together.

320
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:42,050
Two together?

321
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:45,842
They were my childhood
friends and...

322
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:48,633
that's how we ended up one night.

323
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:52,717
The three of us were drunk and
we ended up in bed together.

324
00:23:54,008 --> 00:23:55,592
All three of you?

325
00:23:57,050 --> 00:23:58,717
Well, when you're 17,

326
00:23:59,050 --> 00:24:03,592
You do a lot of things just to feel
secure and emotional.

327
00:24:04,133 --> 00:24:05,758
Right.

328
00:24:55,258 --> 00:24:57,175
Consuela.

329
00:24:58,008 --> 00:25:00,675
My whole life was
dedicated to independence

330
00:25:00,675 --> 00:25:03,300
and at some cost I had achieved my goal.

331
00:25:03,842 --> 00:25:06,008
Nevertheless, it was in that moment,

332
00:25:07,175 --> 00:25:10,425
That my terrible jealousy was born.

333
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,050
That is when I realised that
I would never, ever,

334
00:25:13,508 --> 00:25:16,717
really possess her.

335
00:25:17,175 --> 00:25:19,425
I feel anxious unless I speak
to her on the phone every day,

336
00:25:19,758 --> 00:25:22,258
and then I feel anxious
after we've spoken.

337
00:25:24,383 --> 00:25:25,675
What are you wearing?

338
00:25:26,633 --> 00:25:28,425
Where are you?

339
00:25:33,383 --> 00:25:36,008
I knew it's only a matter of time

340
00:25:36,008 --> 00:25:38,633
before a young man found
her and took her away.

341
00:25:42,383 --> 00:25:43,717
I knew.

342
00:25:44,425 --> 00:25:47,592
Because I was once that young
man who would have done it.

343
00:26:13,258 --> 00:26:15,300
Well, at least does
it makes you feel young?

344
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:17,383
It's like playing soccer
with a bunch of 20 year olds.

345
00:26:17,758 --> 00:26:20,967
It doesn't make you feel 20 because
you're playing with huge difference,

346
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:22,925
every second of the game.

347
00:26:23,633 --> 00:26:25,092
You have to leave her.

348
00:26:25,467 --> 00:26:27,800
Your hands will always be
tied by this girl.

349
00:26:28,175 --> 00:26:30,425
She's going to leave you
sooner or later, anyway.

350
00:26:30,842 --> 00:26:33,425
So it's always better to
keep one step ahead.

351
00:26:34,675 --> 00:26:36,800
Take her to a nice romantic spot

352
00:26:37,425 --> 00:26:39,258
tell her it's over.

353
00:26:39,675 --> 00:26:41,092
That's what I'd do.

354
00:26:45,925 --> 00:26:49,883
My parents talk about all these
places they wanted to go to.

355
00:26:50,425 --> 00:26:54,175
They have all the money to go
wherever they want, but...

356
00:26:54,633 --> 00:26:57,342
leaving Cuba was their first
and last trip.

357
00:26:59,383 --> 00:27:01,258
I don't want my life to be like that.

358
00:27:01,592 --> 00:27:03,467
Let me take you places.

359
00:27:03,883 --> 00:27:06,217
<i>What the hell are you saying?
You brought her here to say goodbye.</i>

360
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:08,133
- Where would we go?
- Europe.

361
00:27:08,508 --> 00:27:12,508
We could go to Paris this summer,
or Rome, or Madrid.

362
00:27:12,758 --> 00:27:16,508
We can visit the Prado and see the
real Velasquez, the real Goya.

363
00:27:16,925 --> 00:27:18,842
<i>The Prado?</i>

364
00:27:19,217 --> 00:27:20,883
Do you mean it?

365
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,550
Of course I meant it.

366
00:27:24,217 --> 00:27:27,467
And we can finish our trip in Venice,
you'll love Venice.

367
00:27:30,967 --> 00:27:33,967
- And you would ride a gondola with me.
- Maybe.

368
00:27:35,217 --> 00:27:36,508
Maybe.

369
00:27:38,425 --> 00:27:40,842
"Maybe" may be your favorite word.

370
00:27:42,633 --> 00:27:44,842
I'll sing to you in the gondola.

371
00:27:48,092 --> 00:27:49,425
We'll see.

372
00:28:01,258 --> 00:28:02,217
What's this from:

373
00:28:02,258 --> 00:28:05,217
"They're making a beast with two backs".
What's that from?

374
00:28:05,842 --> 00:28:07,342
William Shakespeare!

375
00:28:07,883 --> 00:28:09,967
"Othello, The Moor of Venice".

376
00:28:10,425 --> 00:28:13,717
And we're making a monster
with four legs.

377
00:28:14,883 --> 00:28:16,592
Where shall we have dinner?

378
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:18,633
I can't, I'm going out tonight.

379
00:28:18,967 --> 00:28:20,967
- You are? With whom?
- With my brother.

380
00:28:21,258 --> 00:28:23,883
We're going to go dancing
to that place "Kalimas".

381
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:26,008
Your brother...?

382
00:28:27,967 --> 00:28:30,133
You never mentioned a brother.

383
00:28:30,717 --> 00:28:33,133
Well, there is a lot of things
you don't know about me yet.

384
00:28:41,258 --> 00:28:42,467
Thank you.

385
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:51,092
Here we are.

386
00:28:53,425 --> 00:28:55,717
I really had a great
time with you today.

387
00:28:56,467 --> 00:28:57,925
Me too.

388
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,008
Thank you.

389
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:16,592
Bye.

390
00:29:17,925 --> 00:29:18,925
Bye.

391
00:29:27,467 --> 00:29:29,675
Are you really going out with
your brother tonight?

392
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:32,425
David!

393
00:29:32,842 --> 00:29:34,258
That was a joke.

394
00:29:35,258 --> 00:29:36,258
Bye.

395
00:29:54,758 --> 00:29:58,300
On the nights she isn't
with me I am deformed,

396
00:29:59,175 --> 00:30:01,550
thinking of where she might be.

397
00:30:03,217 --> 00:30:06,258
And all this because this girl
will tell me a thousand times

398
00:30:06,675 --> 00:30:09,633
how much she adores me and means it.

399
00:30:11,383 --> 00:30:14,800
This girl will never once tell
me she yearns for my cock.

400
00:31:32,342 --> 00:31:33,508
How are you?

401
00:31:34,633 --> 00:31:35,967
What are you doing here?

402
00:31:37,133 --> 00:31:38,925
I was on my way to see a friend,

403
00:31:39,467 --> 00:31:42,050
who lives near here.
How's things?

404
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:43,883
What's the matter?

405
00:31:44,883 --> 00:31:47,342
- Did you came here to check on me?
- I told you.

406
00:31:47,717 --> 00:31:50,008
I was down in the neighborhood
and I saw this place.

407
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,800
Do you want to ruin everything?

408
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:57,633
No.

409
00:31:58,342 --> 00:32:01,633
So then you're going to have
to start trusting me.

410
00:32:04,383 --> 00:32:05,508
I'll call you tomorrow.

411
00:32:06,467 --> 00:32:07,883
No, I'll call you.

412
00:32:31,592 --> 00:32:35,175
I never behaved like such an
idiot even when I was her age.

413
00:32:35,675 --> 00:32:37,717
Good thing is, at least now,

414
00:32:38,133 --> 00:32:41,800
it's finished, she won't want to
see me anymore. I understand her.

415
00:32:42,217 --> 00:32:44,675
I mean, even I wouldn't want to
see me anymore if I was her.

416
00:32:46,842 --> 00:32:48,467
Maybe it's just as well.

417
00:32:48,883 --> 00:32:51,633
- Yes.
- Just as well.

418
00:32:53,383 --> 00:32:55,300
Oh, my God.

419
00:33:11,675 --> 00:33:12,467
Hello?

420
00:33:12,967 --> 00:33:14,550
David, it's Consuela.

421
00:33:20,008 --> 00:33:21,883
During the last two days

422
00:33:22,342 --> 00:33:23,967
I've been thinking a bit about us.

423
00:33:24,342 --> 00:33:25,675
Have you?

424
00:33:26,383 --> 00:33:27,717
Yes.

425
00:33:29,717 --> 00:33:31,967
And what were you thinking?

426
00:33:35,133 --> 00:33:36,758
That it's all over.

427
00:33:37,175 --> 00:33:39,467
What do you really want from me?

428
00:33:40,092 --> 00:33:41,383
What do I really want from you?

429
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:45,925
You spend you whole life

430
00:33:46,508 --> 00:33:50,300
going through relationships without

431
00:33:50,633 --> 00:33:52,633
ever really bonding with anyone.

432
00:33:54,925 --> 00:33:56,383
So, at least I would like to know,

433
00:33:56,717 --> 00:33:58,508
who I am for you.

434
00:34:04,758 --> 00:34:08,175
The fact that you're jealous and
possessive doesn't help me, at all.

435
00:34:10,133 --> 00:34:13,675
Even little kids are jealous of their
toys until they get tired of them.

436
00:34:14,008 --> 00:34:15,342
and want new ones. So...

437
00:34:16,425 --> 00:34:19,342
is that how it's going
to be between us two?

438
00:34:25,717 --> 00:34:27,800
Have you ever imagined...

439
00:34:31,342 --> 00:34:33,675
a future with me?

440
00:34:36,383 --> 00:34:38,883
A future with you scares me.

441
00:34:40,967 --> 00:34:42,925
- It scares you?
- Yes.

442
00:34:45,258 --> 00:34:46,258
Why?

443
00:34:56,008 --> 00:34:59,842
Because, there's a 30 odd
year age difference

444
00:35:00,217 --> 00:35:03,467
between you and me,

445
00:35:03,883 --> 00:35:06,467
and you have your whole
life ahead of you.

446
00:35:06,883 --> 00:35:09,883
It's just a matter of time
before you realise it too.

447
00:35:10,258 --> 00:35:14,758
I didn't ask you what I was going to do,
I asked what you wanted to do with me.

448
00:35:27,383 --> 00:35:30,175
When you make love to a woman you
get revenge for all the things

449
00:35:30,508 --> 00:35:32,883
that defeated you in life.

450
00:36:16,217 --> 00:36:20,133
I spent my whole life jumping
from one relationship to another,

451
00:36:20,467 --> 00:36:26,217
because this made me believe that I was
never alone, and that time was not passing.

452
00:36:29,883 --> 00:36:32,342
I've always surmised,
for example,

453
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:36,467
that D.H. Lawrence, when he was writing

454
00:36:36,758 --> 00:36:38,883
"Lady Chatterley's Lover"...

455
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:41,592
"Who am I for you?",
she asked me one day.

456
00:36:41,883 --> 00:36:44,675
I was to afraid to ask
who I was for her.

457
00:36:48,425 --> 00:36:51,258
How long could it have lasted?

458
00:37:01,592 --> 00:37:02,883
Surprise.

459
00:37:10,842 --> 00:37:12,758
Yes. Let me... wow!

460
00:37:17,092 --> 00:37:19,383
Thank God for Carolyn.

461
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:58,258
Carolyn is my only point of contact
with the self-confident man I used to be.

462
00:38:09,050 --> 00:38:10,508
How was that play?

463
00:38:11,633 --> 00:38:12,883
Which play?

464
00:38:14,175 --> 00:38:16,508
The one you took George to.

465
00:38:17,175 --> 00:38:19,467
Oh, unremarkable, just...

466
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:26,508
Here I go.

467
00:38:26,967 --> 00:38:28,508
Oh, hit and run.

468
00:38:28,883 --> 00:38:30,217
Just the way you like it.

469
00:38:30,633 --> 00:38:33,008
Good thing I don't have pets.

470
00:38:33,425 --> 00:38:34,925
Only you.

471
00:38:50,175 --> 00:38:52,592
Which one was Carlos Alonzo?

472
00:38:53,883 --> 00:38:56,883
- From high school.
- What was his thing?

473
00:38:57,175 --> 00:38:59,258
What did he want you to do?

474
00:39:05,925 --> 00:39:07,050
He liked...

475
00:39:07,425 --> 00:39:09,633
to watch me menstruate.

476
00:39:12,008 --> 00:39:13,550
What?

477
00:39:13,842 --> 00:39:16,550
- He liked to watch me menstruate.
- I don't believe this.

478
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:20,258
The respectable Cuban-American girl
whose parents worship Ronald Reagan,

479
00:39:20,508 --> 00:39:24,175
who enforce an 8 o'clock curfew on their
daughter, in summer time, no less,

480
00:39:24,508 --> 00:39:27,008
there she is in high school,
aged 15...

481
00:39:27,425 --> 00:39:28,300
16.

482
00:39:28,883 --> 00:39:31,550
I'm so sorry.
That makes all the difference.

483
00:39:33,050 --> 00:39:36,258
- I think you're being ridiculous.
- How did you manage it?

484
00:39:36,758 --> 00:39:37,717
David...

485
00:39:38,217 --> 00:39:39,758
I'm really curious.
What do you do?

486
00:39:40,133 --> 00:39:42,758
You find yourself having your period,
pick up a phone, you ask him to come over?

487
00:39:43,092 --> 00:39:44,717
"Hey Carlos, I'm starting."

488
00:39:45,217 --> 00:39:47,592
And then he appears,
all Cuban and "respectable",

489
00:39:47,967 --> 00:39:50,175
And the pair of you retire to the
bathroom where you have the ceremony

490
00:39:50,425 --> 00:39:52,008
of the pulling down of the tampon.

491
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:55,758
Yeah, it's just like you were there.

492
00:39:57,925 --> 00:39:59,383
Just filling in...

493
00:39:59,758 --> 00:40:03,133
the missing...
just filling in the blanks.

494
00:40:03,758 --> 00:40:05,300
Which blanks?

495
00:40:05,633 --> 00:40:07,800
Five. Now we're down to 3.

496
00:40:08,217 --> 00:40:10,925
Because of the two guys who...

497
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:12,925
I have to go, sorry.

498
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:20,092
What is this?

499
00:40:20,425 --> 00:40:22,258
- What?
- This.

500
00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:27,383
You're fucking other women.

501
00:40:28,342 --> 00:40:30,842
I had two husbands who
fucked other women.

502
00:40:31,217 --> 00:40:34,633
I didn't like it then, I don't
like it now, least of all with you.

503
00:40:34,925 --> 00:40:38,592
You have everything with me David.
Pure fucking.

504
00:40:38,925 --> 00:40:41,758
No hidden agendas,
No icky entanglements.

505
00:40:42,008 --> 00:40:45,092
How could you do this?
There aren't many like me.

506
00:40:47,008 --> 00:40:48,883
I actually understand you.

507
00:40:49,342 --> 00:40:51,217
I am one in a million.

508
00:40:51,675 --> 00:40:53,342
How could you possibly fuck...?

509
00:40:53,758 --> 00:40:54,758
I don't know whose that is.

510
00:40:55,258 --> 00:40:56,842
Why don't you put it
on a bagel and eat it.

511
00:40:56,842 --> 00:40:58,425
I have a pretty good idea.

512
00:41:00,258 --> 00:41:01,383
I'm sure you do.

513
00:41:01,883 --> 00:41:03,758
You know my friend
George O'Hearn, the poet?

514
00:41:04,050 --> 00:41:06,133
George uses tampons?
Since when?

515
00:41:06,925 --> 00:41:08,967
No, listen. George...

516
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:12,675
has the keys to this apartment.
He gives poetry readings, he meets girls.

517
00:41:13,050 --> 00:41:16,008
He can't bring them home,
to his wife in New Rochelle.

518
00:41:16,425 --> 00:41:18,008
And since he's always short on funds...

519
00:41:18,342 --> 00:41:21,008
- And since some of them are married...
- George fucks all these women in your bed?

520
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:23,675
Not all, some.
He uses the bed in the guest room.

521
00:41:24,133 --> 00:41:26,050
His marriage isn't paradise.

522
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:28,008
Probably a bit like mine and he
wasn't desperate enough to get out.

523
00:41:28,383 --> 00:41:30,467
I don't believe a fucking
word you're saying.

524
00:41:31,008 --> 00:41:33,258
Everything in your life
is so meticulous.

525
00:41:33,592 --> 00:41:36,883
- It's so orderly...
- I don't know whose tampon this is.

526
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,258
You have to believe me.

527
00:41:42,383 --> 00:41:44,967
You're all I'm holding on to.

528
00:41:46,175 --> 00:41:48,217
<i>In this at least I was
telling the truth.</i>

529
00:42:12,092 --> 00:42:13,967
<i>Of course the whole situation
was ridiculous.</i>

530
00:42:42,050 --> 00:42:43,092
Do I snore?

531
00:42:44,842 --> 00:42:46,633
- Yes?
- It's worse.

532
00:42:48,092 --> 00:42:49,383
What?

533
00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:51,842
Well...

534
00:42:52,258 --> 00:42:53,717
You drool.

535
00:42:54,342 --> 00:42:55,258
Yes.

536
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:57,217
- You drool on...
- Not true!

537
00:42:57,425 --> 00:42:58,550
You drool in your sleep.

538
00:42:59,217 --> 00:43:01,925
Beautiful women are invisible.

539
00:43:02,258 --> 00:43:04,467
Invisible?
What the hell does that mean?

540
00:43:15,425 --> 00:43:16,675
Invisible.

541
00:43:17,092 --> 00:43:20,383
They jump out at you. A beautiful
woman stands out... stands apart

542
00:43:21,258 --> 00:43:25,008
- You can't miss her.
- But we never actually see the person.

543
00:43:25,508 --> 00:43:27,342
We see the beautiful shell.

544
00:43:27,675 --> 00:43:30,383
We're blocked by the beauty barrier.

545
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:35,258
Look at you.

546
00:43:46,258 --> 00:43:47,467
What?

547
00:43:48,550 --> 00:43:49,967
What did you say?

548
00:43:53,258 --> 00:43:56,175
- You're deaf, Mr Kepesh.
- No. What?

549
00:43:56,675 --> 00:43:59,175
Or maybe you do not want to hear.

550
00:43:59,550 --> 00:44:02,008
Maybe that's the problem with you.

551
00:44:15,258 --> 00:44:20,217
Yes. We're so dazzled by the outside,
we never make it inside.

552
00:44:29,717 --> 00:44:31,842
Do you always work in black and white?

553
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:35,925
Mainly.
I like the theatricality.

554
00:44:36,758 --> 00:44:38,508
Is that how you see the world?

555
00:44:39,342 --> 00:44:40,633
In black and white?

556
00:44:40,967 --> 00:44:42,342
No.

557
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:46,258
That distinction belongs to my son.

558
00:44:48,008 --> 00:44:50,633
You always speak of him
with such bitterness.

559
00:44:51,967 --> 00:44:55,092
In my family,
that would be so strange.

560
00:44:55,758 --> 00:44:57,425
Take a look.

561
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:05,300
Beautiful picture.

562
00:45:06,592 --> 00:45:08,175
Beautiful woman.

563
00:45:09,633 --> 00:45:11,842
Look, my hands are huge.

564
00:45:13,467 --> 00:45:15,300
I want you so much.

565
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:22,217
David...

566
00:45:23,925 --> 00:45:25,425
Your fridge is empty.

567
00:45:27,092 --> 00:45:28,967
If we are staying in,

568
00:45:30,758 --> 00:45:33,258
we have to go shopping.

569
00:45:36,675 --> 00:45:39,425
Excuse me, Professor,
but your Spanish is awful.

570
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:42,175
- Then teach me.
- Yeah, I'll teach you.

571
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:44,675
I'll teach you "mañana".

572
00:45:49,425 --> 00:45:52,175
- Isn't that your poet friend?
- Keep walking.

573
00:45:57,342 --> 00:46:00,092
- That woman is not his wife?
- That's right.

574
00:46:02,092 --> 00:46:04,217
- I find that disgusting.
- It isn't our business.

575
00:46:04,592 --> 00:46:07,175
- And that's the end of it?
- Let's not discuss it here.

576
00:46:07,967 --> 00:46:10,508
- Are you OK with that?
- With what?

577
00:46:12,425 --> 00:46:15,425
For all you know he's just having
a cup of coffee with a friend.

578
00:46:15,883 --> 00:46:17,258
You know,
you're jumping to conclusions.

579
00:46:17,717 --> 00:46:21,383
David, being younger than you
doesn't make me a child.

580
00:46:21,717 --> 00:46:24,217
In any event, it's not our business.

581
00:46:24,592 --> 00:46:26,800
You keep saying that,
but what do you think about it?

582
00:46:29,008 --> 00:46:30,925
What I think is...

583
00:46:31,467 --> 00:46:33,342
that marriage...

584
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:36,383
is a problematic institution at best.

585
00:46:36,967 --> 00:46:38,800
Which is why you married your wife.

586
00:46:39,258 --> 00:46:40,967
Which is why I don't cheat on her.

587
00:46:41,383 --> 00:46:45,967
- But you were married once.
- Yes, yes! Yes! Yes!

588
00:46:47,008 --> 00:46:48,300
What do you want me to say?

589
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:50,383
I was married.

590
00:46:50,883 --> 00:46:52,508
It was a mistake.

591
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:54,633
Did you try?

592
00:46:55,133 --> 00:46:58,300
Did you really try?
Where I come from...

593
00:46:59,883 --> 00:47:03,092
I know, where you come from the
rules are different, but they're not.

594
00:47:08,175 --> 00:47:10,175
You're such a cynic.

595
00:47:10,592 --> 00:47:12,717
I'm such a realist.

596
00:47:13,633 --> 00:47:15,425
I think you're just infantile.

597
00:47:15,925 --> 00:47:18,050
I'm sure you're right.

598
00:47:27,008 --> 00:47:30,467
I hung in there for over a year.
It was a real roller coaster ride.

599
00:47:30,883 --> 00:47:33,383
And like all rides,
sooner or later, it has to end.

600
00:47:42,217 --> 00:47:44,133
What are you doing a
week from Sunday?

601
00:47:45,050 --> 00:47:46,300
I don't know. Why?

602
00:47:46,675 --> 00:47:47,592
Something to drink?

603
00:47:48,842 --> 00:47:51,342
- Yeah, two Bellinis, please.
- Okay.

604
00:47:52,008 --> 00:47:54,133
What's a week from Sunday?

605
00:47:54,592 --> 00:47:56,383
My parents are throwing
me a graduation party,

606
00:47:56,675 --> 00:47:58,925
to celebrate my MFA.

607
00:47:59,925 --> 00:48:01,758
I'd like you to come.

608
00:48:04,758 --> 00:48:05,675
David...

609
00:48:06,258 --> 00:48:07,425
Everyone knows about you.

610
00:48:07,925 --> 00:48:09,883
For a whole year and half

611
00:48:09,883 --> 00:48:11,883
they've been asking me about
this mystery man I'm seeing.

612
00:48:12,467 --> 00:48:15,342
They're going to start thinking
I'm with some drug dealer,

613
00:48:15,633 --> 00:48:16,967
if you don't stop hiding.

614
00:48:17,258 --> 00:48:18,758
I'm not hiding.

615
00:48:20,133 --> 00:48:23,008
- You didn't come to my birthday.
- Well you didn't ask me.

616
00:48:23,633 --> 00:48:27,592
I asked you to Christmas dinner
with my parents. You had plans.

617
00:48:27,925 --> 00:48:30,300
Then I invited you to Thanksgiving
dinner, you couldn't come.

618
00:48:30,758 --> 00:48:33,425
Whoa, Thanksgiving I really couldn't.

619
00:48:47,425 --> 00:48:48,758
David...

620
00:48:49,175 --> 00:48:50,133
Huh?

621
00:48:50,508 --> 00:48:52,592
I want you to meet my family.

622
00:48:53,008 --> 00:48:54,758
But I'm not going to insist.

623
00:48:55,258 --> 00:48:58,342
I just want you to say yes
because you want to come.

624
00:48:59,717 --> 00:49:02,467
- Here we go.
- Thanks.

625
00:49:03,008 --> 00:49:04,467
Enjoy.

626
00:49:07,175 --> 00:49:08,342
Listen to me.

627
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:11,925
Listen to me.

628
00:49:16,925 --> 00:49:18,967
When I come to your party,

629
00:49:19,883 --> 00:49:21,967
you have to promise to do something.

630
00:49:27,342 --> 00:49:28,467
What?

631
00:49:29,342 --> 00:49:31,592
Don't take your eyes of me,

632
00:49:32,050 --> 00:49:34,258
When the Cubanates come,

633
00:49:34,592 --> 00:49:37,258
Stampeding towards me.

634
00:49:40,550 --> 00:49:42,050
That's all?

635
00:49:42,383 --> 00:49:43,758
That's all.

636
00:49:45,425 --> 00:49:46,842
Okay.

637
00:49:47,592 --> 00:49:48,842
So...

638
00:49:49,758 --> 00:49:52,467
- That means yes?
- That means yes.

639
00:49:54,008 --> 00:49:55,050
Okay.

640
00:50:10,925 --> 00:50:12,967
I'm happy.

641
00:50:14,633 --> 00:50:15,717
Good.

642
00:50:16,217 --> 00:50:18,133
And now the food.

643
00:50:22,675 --> 00:50:24,133
Her parents will be there, I hope,

644
00:50:24,508 --> 00:50:26,217
grandparents will be there,

645
00:50:27,467 --> 00:50:31,508
Cuban relatives, all her childhood
friends... and who knows,

646
00:50:31,842 --> 00:50:35,717
Carlos Alonso and the two guys who
made her the meat of their sandwich.

647
00:50:36,133 --> 00:50:37,675
And I'll be introduced as...

648
00:50:38,008 --> 00:50:40,133
"The Teacher Who's on Television."

649
00:50:41,383 --> 00:50:42,592
What's wrong with that?

650
00:50:42,967 --> 00:50:45,592
What's wrong is I'll be
judged for my age.

651
00:50:46,092 --> 00:50:47,842
They'll say all the horrible
things they say in these cases.

652
00:50:48,133 --> 00:50:50,342
She's with me because she
wants something in return,

653
00:50:50,633 --> 00:50:53,467
and I'm with her
because I like new girls.

654
00:50:53,842 --> 00:50:54,925
Pathetic.

655
00:50:55,342 --> 00:50:58,008
It's about time to face your situation.
That's what I think.

656
00:51:02,925 --> 00:51:04,842
Who is Carlos Alonso?

657
00:51:06,675 --> 00:51:07,925
Some guy.

658
00:51:14,550 --> 00:51:16,175
- Hello?
- Hi.

659
00:51:16,633 --> 00:51:18,633
- Did I wake you up?
- No, I was reading.

660
00:51:20,883 --> 00:51:24,092
I just wanted to say goodnight...

661
00:51:25,008 --> 00:51:27,092
and tell you how happy I am that
you're going to come tomorrow

662
00:51:27,550 --> 00:51:31,342
and how important it is for me.

663
00:51:32,175 --> 00:51:33,758
And for me too.

664
00:51:35,008 --> 00:51:36,217
Okay.

665
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:37,967
See you then.

666
00:51:38,383 --> 00:51:39,883
See you then.

667
00:51:40,133 --> 00:51:42,092
- Good night.
- Good night.

668
00:52:45,342 --> 00:52:47,258
- Consuela...
- David, where are you?

669
00:52:47,675 --> 00:52:49,883
You won't believe what
just happened, my...

670
00:52:50,342 --> 00:52:53,092
I'm stuck on the
George Washington bridge.

671
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:56,592
My car's broken down.

672
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,467
Consuela?

673
00:53:04,133 --> 00:53:05,925
I called AAA.

674
00:53:06,342 --> 00:53:08,675
They say they're going to
be at least an hour.

675
00:53:09,092 --> 00:53:12,592
And then they're going to have to get
me off the bridge and tow me some place.

676
00:53:12,925 --> 00:53:15,967
I'll call you right after, Okay?

677
00:53:16,592 --> 00:53:18,258
Consuela?

678
00:53:20,258 --> 00:53:22,425
Why are you doing this to me?

679
00:53:25,133 --> 00:53:26,550
Consuela?

680
00:53:28,842 --> 00:53:30,092
Hello?

681
00:54:25,967 --> 00:54:28,050
One new message.

682
00:54:28,758 --> 00:54:30,675
First new message...

683
00:54:31,592 --> 00:54:34,217
I saw you today on television,

684
00:54:34,550 --> 00:54:36,508
playing the wise old man

685
00:54:36,967 --> 00:54:38,175
who knows everything.

686
00:54:38,758 --> 00:54:40,675
The one who always knows better.

687
00:54:41,258 --> 00:54:43,925
The one who knows what's good culture,
and what people should read,

688
00:54:46,342 --> 00:54:49,633
and all about music
all about art...

689
00:54:51,883 --> 00:54:54,092
You know so many things.

690
00:54:56,842 --> 00:54:59,258
But I'm here,
trying to celebrate

691
00:54:59,967 --> 00:55:04,092
this important moment
of my life.

692
00:55:04,717 --> 00:55:07,550
And I decide to have a party
and I want to have you here.

693
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:10,800
Why?

694
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:13,758
Why, Consuela, why?

695
00:55:16,425 --> 00:55:20,175
Because you mean
everything to me.

696
00:55:22,092 --> 00:55:23,758
You do.

697
00:55:24,467 --> 00:55:27,592
But, anyway, you are not here.

698
00:55:29,050 --> 00:55:32,425
I just wanted you to know something...

699
00:55:34,300 --> 00:55:36,758
that I loved you.

700
00:55:37,883 --> 00:55:40,092
Very much.

701
00:55:41,425 --> 00:55:44,050
Very, very much.

702
00:56:14,925 --> 00:56:16,133
Consuela?

703
00:56:16,675 --> 00:56:18,633
It's me. Open up.

704
00:56:19,133 --> 00:56:21,717
- Kenny.
- Come on, open up.

705
00:56:49,633 --> 00:56:51,050
Hello.

706
00:56:52,092 --> 00:56:53,967
Why are all the lights off?

707
00:57:13,425 --> 00:57:14,842
I'm having an affair.

708
00:57:18,425 --> 00:57:20,425
Did you hear what I just said?

709
00:57:21,008 --> 00:57:22,342
You!

710
00:57:24,175 --> 00:57:26,467
- Is that all that you have to say?
- Congratulations.

711
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:27,758
Congratulations...

712
00:57:28,175 --> 00:57:29,258
You're a riot, you know that?

713
00:57:29,925 --> 00:57:32,217
I'm sorry.
I'm not sure what to say.

714
00:57:34,508 --> 00:57:35,717
This is awful.

715
00:57:37,258 --> 00:57:38,467
I'm coming apart.

716
00:57:38,967 --> 00:57:41,425
I thought you were happily married,
you always told me you were happily married.

717
00:57:41,717 --> 00:57:43,258
- I am.
- Well...

718
00:57:43,675 --> 00:57:46,633
Forgive me, but I can't see how
that can be entirely true.

719
00:57:47,092 --> 00:57:49,550
Anyway, you don't look
terribly happy right now.

720
00:57:50,092 --> 00:57:52,258
- But you don't understand.
- Kenny...

721
00:57:52,675 --> 00:57:54,842
I'm trying to understand.
You're having an affair.

722
00:57:55,342 --> 00:57:58,633
So you come here, because,
what, I'm the expert.

723
00:57:58,967 --> 00:58:01,633
There's no-one else to talk to.

724
00:58:02,008 --> 00:58:03,550
I'm sorry.

725
00:58:04,300 --> 00:58:05,675
What you going to do?

726
00:58:07,258 --> 00:58:08,550
I don't know.

727
00:58:12,092 --> 00:58:13,592
Would you like something to drink?

728
00:58:16,883 --> 00:58:18,175
What will you have?

729
00:58:18,633 --> 00:58:22,175
Glenfiddich, bourbon, vodka,
Cointreau, Grand Marnier,

730
00:58:22,550 --> 00:58:23,967
Armagnac...

731
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:26,508
No. Diet coke.

732
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:28,217
Diet coke it is.

733
00:58:29,883 --> 00:58:33,258
This isn't some kind of irresponsible fling.

734
00:58:33,758 --> 00:58:37,342
I love Lisa, I really do,
and the kids are my whole life.

735
00:58:38,758 --> 00:58:40,258
Knowing you,

736
00:58:40,717 --> 00:58:43,258
it's probably simplest if you
just break off the other...

737
00:58:43,883 --> 00:58:45,133
Oh, I can't.

738
00:58:45,717 --> 00:58:48,258
This woman is...

739
00:58:48,550 --> 00:58:50,675
like no-one else on earth.

740
00:58:51,092 --> 00:58:53,758
I've never felt so alive,
so full of energy.

741
00:58:54,133 --> 00:58:55,842
And she's a great person.

742
00:58:56,300 --> 00:58:58,550
She has degrees in
chemistry and art history.

743
00:58:58,550 --> 00:59:00,883
She plays the oboe, for chrissakes.

744
00:59:01,258 --> 00:59:02,675
And her kids are...

745
00:59:03,050 --> 00:59:05,300
- fabulous
- She has children?

746
00:59:05,633 --> 00:59:08,258
Three. Scott, little Shawn...

747
00:59:08,717 --> 00:59:12,217
Hold on Kenny! What are we talking
about here? Her children or your adultery?

748
00:59:12,467 --> 00:59:14,258
- Don't call it that.
- Well, what would you call it?

749
00:59:14,592 --> 00:59:18,425
See, you sound like Lisa. You try to
over-simplify a complicated situation.

750
00:59:19,633 --> 00:59:20,383
I...

751
00:59:20,842 --> 00:59:22,175
I'm committed to this relationship,

752
00:59:22,550 --> 00:59:24,967
unlike you, who's terrified
of committing to anyone.

753
00:59:25,383 --> 00:59:27,675
Dana is a real person

754
00:59:27,717 --> 00:59:30,050
so don't equate what's happening
to me with your serial tom-catting.

755
00:59:30,342 --> 00:59:32,467
- What have I got to do with it?
- Plenty!

756
00:59:33,133 --> 00:59:34,258
Anyway,

757
00:59:34,675 --> 00:59:38,800
Dana isn't one of your little
star-struck students.

758
00:59:41,592 --> 00:59:43,592
If you want my advice,

759
00:59:44,175 --> 00:59:46,133
Lisa mustn't know a word of this,

760
00:59:46,717 --> 00:59:49,217
- until you've made up your mind...
- Lisa already knows.

761
00:59:49,842 --> 00:59:51,342
Why on earth did you tell Lisa?

762
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:54,717
- You expect me to lie to my wife?
- Now you can't retreat even if you want to.

763
00:59:56,675 --> 00:59:57,758
God!

764
00:59:58,425 --> 01:00:01,175
I don't know why I came here. I don't
know what help you could possibly be.

765
01:00:01,467 --> 01:00:03,092
Except maybe, maybe...

766
01:00:05,050 --> 01:00:07,050
I hoped that you might relate to me,

767
01:00:08,008 --> 01:00:09,467
as a father...

768
01:00:09,883 --> 01:00:12,217
- for just once.
- I don't know how to relate to you.

769
01:00:12,592 --> 01:00:14,425
You're so morally superior
to me in every way.

770
01:00:14,425 --> 01:00:16,258
Even our adulteries can't compare.

771
01:00:16,633 --> 01:00:18,550
Yours plays the oboe, what have I
got to put up against that

772
01:00:19,050 --> 01:00:21,258
She probably writes poetry in her
spare time, and her kids do too.

773
01:00:21,508 --> 01:00:22,800
You're such a jerk.

774
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:24,092
However, if you are,
as you say, committed...

775
01:00:24,425 --> 01:00:25,967
You're going to have to end your marriage.

776
01:00:26,300 --> 01:00:29,008
How can I? If I walk out on
Lisa and the kids...

777
01:00:29,342 --> 01:00:32,217
If I do what you did,
then I'll destroy them.

778
01:00:32,550 --> 01:00:35,758
Why do you say that? You survived.
Your mother survived.

779
01:00:36,550 --> 01:00:38,175
Are you trying to tell me

780
01:00:38,675 --> 01:00:43,258
that you did the morally correct
thing by walking out on us?

781
01:00:43,592 --> 01:00:45,300
It was honest.

782
01:00:45,550 --> 01:00:46,758
God!

783
01:00:53,967 --> 01:00:55,758
- I'm leaving.
- There's the door.

784
01:00:57,008 --> 01:00:59,925
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

785
01:01:16,342 --> 01:01:18,675
<i>Consuela didn't call the next day.</i>

786
01:01:21,925 --> 01:01:24,258
<i>and not even the day after.</i>

787
01:01:27,133 --> 01:01:29,092
<i>She never called again.</i>

788
01:01:51,842 --> 01:01:53,008
You've gotta eat something.

789
01:01:54,717 --> 01:01:56,967
You gotta get out of this fucking bed.

790
01:01:58,092 --> 01:02:00,675
- I ruined everything, George.
- You didn't ruin anything.

791
01:02:01,258 --> 01:02:03,342
It just came to its natural end.

792
01:02:03,967 --> 01:02:04,842
You were her teacher,

793
01:02:05,175 --> 01:02:07,092
her big growing-up experience.

794
01:02:07,592 --> 01:02:10,217
You called the whole thing from day one.

795
01:02:11,050 --> 01:02:13,050
It was bound to end
sooner or later. Eat.

796
01:02:13,425 --> 01:02:14,342
I miss her.

797
01:02:14,675 --> 01:02:17,008
Well, that's easy for you to say
now that she's out of the picture.

798
01:02:17,217 --> 01:02:20,008
I was in love with her, George.
I never felt anything like that in all my life.

799
01:02:20,592 --> 01:02:23,633
Well, it's better late than never.
Now you gotta get back with your own life.

800
01:02:24,008 --> 01:02:25,633
You're gonna be feeling better soon.

801
01:02:26,008 --> 01:02:27,550
Time heals all wounds.

802
01:02:29,050 --> 01:02:29,842
Now,

803
01:02:30,258 --> 01:02:31,425
open wide cause here comes.

804
01:02:31,842 --> 01:02:33,717
The train entering the station.

805
01:02:35,425 --> 01:02:37,550
Open wide. There you go...

806
01:02:38,383 --> 01:02:42,300
How does that taste like?
I added a little oregano and some chives.

807
01:02:42,675 --> 01:02:45,258
You're going to make somebody
very happy one day.

808
01:02:48,300 --> 01:02:49,633
You know,

809
01:02:50,342 --> 01:02:52,758
after a long time of
silence and betrayal,

810
01:02:54,258 --> 01:02:56,175
lately Amy and I...

811
01:02:56,925 --> 01:03:00,092
- have been finding each other again.
- You and Amy?

812
01:03:00,467 --> 01:03:03,675
- Your wife? Are you feeling OK?
- Yes, I feel OK.

813
01:03:04,092 --> 01:03:07,425
That's the most incredible thing I've heard
you say in all the years I've known you.

814
01:03:07,842 --> 01:03:10,550
Life always keeps back more surprises

815
01:03:11,675 --> 01:03:14,217
than we can ever imagine.

816
01:03:14,842 --> 01:03:15,633
Yeah.

817
01:03:16,133 --> 01:03:17,008
Dave...

818
01:03:17,592 --> 01:03:18,633
I need a favor.

819
01:03:19,008 --> 01:03:20,050
I gotta go give a poetry reading

820
01:03:20,508 --> 01:03:22,050
at NYU next month,

821
01:03:22,425 --> 01:03:23,717
and they want somebody to introduce me.

822
01:03:24,133 --> 01:03:25,925
George, I understand you
wanting to distract me,

823
01:03:26,258 --> 01:03:29,550
but this is transparent
occupational therapy.

824
01:03:30,550 --> 01:03:32,592
This is no joke.
I want you to present me in the

825
01:03:33,175 --> 01:03:37,425
most embarrassing, flattering terms
all those portly pandering profs.

826
01:03:37,842 --> 01:03:40,092
Present you?
Who's going to present me?

827
01:03:41,508 --> 01:03:45,175
Forrest Lawn?
George, you're a champ for asking, but...

828
01:03:45,675 --> 01:03:48,300
I can't write anything now.
I'm finished.

829
01:03:48,675 --> 01:03:50,758
I may never teach another class.
Find somebody else.

830
01:03:51,258 --> 01:03:54,008
I spent half of life
playing Horatio,

831
01:03:54,342 --> 01:03:56,967
to your third rate Hamlet.

832
01:03:57,383 --> 01:04:00,967
Listening to your endless naval gazing,
your moaning about Kenny, the father-hater,

833
01:04:01,550 --> 01:04:04,800
the women who don't know
when goodbye means goodbye.

834
01:04:05,300 --> 01:04:07,925
And for this you owe me big-time.

835
01:04:08,342 --> 01:04:11,258
Now I expect you to do this
in the name of our friendship.

836
01:04:11,550 --> 01:04:14,008
Now would you fuckin' eat something?

837
01:04:26,258 --> 01:04:28,967
The Poetry of George O'Hearn

838
01:04:30,258 --> 01:04:33,008
makes no apology for itself.

839
01:04:41,592 --> 01:04:44,883
As A.E. Housman wrote

840
01:04:45,342 --> 01:04:47,217
in his celebrated essay,

841
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:49,383
"I don't know what poetry is,

842
01:04:49,800 --> 01:04:52,467
but I recognize
it when I hear it. "

843
01:04:52,883 --> 01:04:56,800
There can be no question that
this evening's guest writes what

844
01:04:57,175 --> 01:05:00,092
we all instantly recognise as poetry.

845
01:05:00,592 --> 01:05:03,883
Since the publication 25 years ago
of his first work in the New Yorker,

846
01:05:04,133 --> 01:05:07,883
George O'Hearn's vigorously
masculine voice

847
01:05:08,342 --> 01:05:10,967
has become a fixture

848
01:05:11,300 --> 01:05:13,342
of the American poetic landscape.

849
01:05:13,758 --> 01:05:16,675
Poetry which is one and the same time,
the language of the street,

850
01:05:17,217 --> 01:05:18,717
potent,

851
01:05:19,008 --> 01:05:21,550
urban and impatient.

852
01:05:21,883 --> 01:05:25,342
But also the un-selfcentered promptings

853
01:05:25,717 --> 01:05:28,008
of an unquiet heart.

854
01:05:28,467 --> 01:05:31,217
In 1988, that
unique combination

855
01:05:31,425 --> 01:05:34,300
of sensibilities
earned George O'Hearn,

856
01:05:35,217 --> 01:05:37,050
The Pulitzer Prize.

857
01:05:38,258 --> 01:05:41,050
But rather than procrastinate further,

858
01:05:41,425 --> 01:05:43,967
or damn him with praise

859
01:05:44,342 --> 01:05:45,967
he will inevitably consider feint,

860
01:05:46,467 --> 01:05:50,175
I turn the proceedings
over to New York's own,

861
01:05:50,550 --> 01:05:51,633
or, should I say,

862
01:05:52,092 --> 01:05:55,050
America's own,
George O'Hearn.

863
01:06:05,925 --> 01:06:07,133
George!

864
01:06:11,092 --> 01:06:12,592
I'll call an ambulance.

865
01:06:34,425 --> 01:06:36,092
Hi, David.

866
01:06:44,925 --> 01:06:46,592
He just woke up a little while ago.

867
01:07:08,383 --> 01:07:09,717
Hi, David.

868
01:07:13,508 --> 01:07:14,883
George...

869
01:07:20,258 --> 01:07:22,300
It's Kepesh.

870
01:07:28,008 --> 01:07:29,258
I'm here, George. I'm here.

871
01:08:08,967 --> 01:08:10,217
George...

872
01:08:15,008 --> 01:08:16,717
I owe you.

873
01:09:01,967 --> 01:09:05,383
I wonder who he thought I was.

874
01:09:06,383 --> 01:09:08,425
I think he knew perfectly well.

875
01:09:12,508 --> 01:09:14,092
You're sweet.

876
01:09:18,383 --> 01:09:20,300
I took him as he was.

877
01:09:20,633 --> 01:09:22,592
He so appreciated that.

878
01:09:23,175 --> 01:09:25,467
He took me the same.

879
01:09:35,967 --> 01:09:38,592
- You're going where?
- I just told you. Florida.

880
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:40,633
To meet her parents,
just for the week-end.

881
01:09:40,967 --> 01:09:43,967
- The girl's...
- Her name is Dana.

882
01:09:44,717 --> 01:09:46,300
You're going to meet her folks?

883
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:48,883
Well I think they should know
I'm not just some kind of pervert.

884
01:09:50,008 --> 01:09:52,633
Kenny, you're nearly 40 years old.
You don't need

885
01:09:53,008 --> 01:09:56,467
the approval of the parents of a
girl who has three children of her own.

886
01:09:57,008 --> 01:09:58,633
Does she want her parents' approval?

887
01:09:58,633 --> 01:10:00,258
If you want my approval,
fine, you've got it.

888
01:10:00,633 --> 01:10:02,717
I just wanted you to understand.
This doesn't mean that

889
01:10:03,258 --> 01:10:06,217
I don't love Lisa.

890
01:10:06,550 --> 01:10:08,383
Kenny, what are you doing?

891
01:10:08,842 --> 01:10:10,592
You're going to escape from one prison

892
01:10:10,925 --> 01:10:14,717
and race headlong into another
maximum security facility.

893
01:10:15,092 --> 01:10:17,800
Where did you get the idea
that marriage is a prison?

894
01:10:18,217 --> 01:10:20,883
From serving time.
It wasn't about your mom.

895
01:10:21,175 --> 01:10:24,133
- I just wasn't cut out for it.
- Is this your version of approval?

896
01:10:26,717 --> 01:10:27,842
Kenny, listen to me.

897
01:10:28,342 --> 01:10:29,758
I'm the only father you have.

898
01:10:30,300 --> 01:10:31,800
I'm the only one you'll ever have.

899
01:10:32,967 --> 01:10:34,342
What a comfort that is.

900
01:10:35,175 --> 01:10:37,217
I know I disappointed you.

901
01:10:37,633 --> 01:10:40,383
But you're not a child,
you've got to get past this rage.

902
01:10:41,342 --> 01:10:45,050
If you ever want there to be anything
between us you've gotta turn the page.

903
01:10:47,425 --> 01:10:49,133
Now excuse me,
I have an appointment.

904
01:10:49,592 --> 01:10:50,883
I'm not finished.

905
01:10:51,925 --> 01:10:53,217
I really have to run.

906
01:10:53,633 --> 01:10:55,217
- What appointment?
- George's funeral.

907
01:10:55,508 --> 01:10:56,467
George who?

908
01:10:56,800 --> 01:10:58,175
- Your friend George?
- Yeah.

909
01:10:58,425 --> 01:11:00,592
- He died?
- Yeah. I gotta go.

910
01:11:00,925 --> 01:11:02,675
We'll finish this later, OK?

911
01:11:02,967 --> 01:11:04,175
I'm sorry.

912
01:11:24,342 --> 01:11:25,592
Hello?

913
01:11:26,425 --> 01:11:29,467
I happened to be in town,
I saw the obit in The Times and I...

914
01:11:30,217 --> 01:11:31,842
In two columns.

915
01:11:32,550 --> 01:11:34,217
Not bad for a poet, I guess.

916
01:11:36,258 --> 01:11:37,925
How are you holding up?

917
01:11:38,425 --> 01:11:41,050
Not so good, but I'll be OK.

918
01:11:41,633 --> 01:11:43,133
How's everything?

919
01:11:44,258 --> 01:11:48,508
Seattle is a great place to
build a business. I'm exhausted.

920
01:11:49,967 --> 01:11:51,383
But I love it.

921
01:11:56,258 --> 01:11:58,383
What're you thinking about, Dave?

922
01:11:58,675 --> 01:11:59,967
Nothing.

923
01:12:00,717 --> 01:12:03,717
We kept acting like teenagers
all our life, that's all.

924
01:12:04,508 --> 01:12:10,175
- Who's we? Me and you?
- Yes, you and I.

925
01:12:10,967 --> 01:12:14,175
We spent our life

926
01:12:15,217 --> 01:12:18,008
chasing after what?

927
01:12:19,467 --> 01:12:22,675
The only time you got pregnant you had
an abortion because the time wasn't right.

928
01:12:22,675 --> 01:12:25,758
That was 15 years ago.

929
01:12:26,925 --> 01:12:29,842
Did the right time ever come?

930
01:12:32,425 --> 01:12:34,342
Not the right person.

931
01:12:56,675 --> 01:12:59,133
Do you remember that tampon
you found in my bathroom?

932
01:13:00,217 --> 01:13:02,425
That thing belonged to a
young girl I was in love with.

933
01:13:04,467 --> 01:13:05,383
What...

934
01:13:07,883 --> 01:13:09,800
What kind of chance did we have?

935
01:13:10,717 --> 01:13:12,758
She and I? None.

936
01:13:13,508 --> 01:13:15,592
At best we could have dragged it out
a couple of years but in the end

937
01:13:15,967 --> 01:13:19,467
she'd have realized
there was little room

938
01:13:20,217 --> 01:13:23,967
in her life for a man thirty
odd years older than she.

939
01:13:25,217 --> 01:13:28,175
Nothing

940
01:13:28,550 --> 01:13:31,925
ever should have happened
between me and that girl.

941
01:13:33,467 --> 01:13:35,508
It was just a mistake.

942
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:50,508
You're getting old David.

943
01:13:53,592 --> 01:13:57,342
The way men look at me
changes every day.

944
01:14:01,675 --> 01:14:04,008
There are women my age,

945
01:14:04,383 --> 01:14:06,675
a lot of women who are on

946
01:14:07,092 --> 01:14:08,800
these dating...

947
01:14:09,217 --> 01:14:11,092
websites.

948
01:14:11,425 --> 01:14:14,883
You're guaranteed a certain
number of dates per year.

949
01:14:16,383 --> 01:14:19,092
And you pay for the silence...

950
01:14:22,300 --> 01:14:24,133
and...

951
01:14:25,342 --> 01:14:28,050
the same conversation,
every time.

952
01:14:34,133 --> 01:14:36,467
I like them like that.

953
01:14:38,550 --> 01:14:42,842
Is it possible that this is really the
first time we talked to each other?

954
01:14:45,467 --> 01:14:46,717
Well...

955
01:14:49,217 --> 01:14:52,717
After 20 years of sleeping together,
it's not bad.

956
01:14:53,133 --> 01:14:54,758
I know a lot of people who

957
01:14:55,800 --> 01:14:59,425
never got that far in 40 years of marriage.

958
01:15:21,550 --> 01:15:23,592
What time is your flight?

959
01:15:24,258 --> 01:15:25,925
9:30.

960
01:15:26,717 --> 01:15:28,175
I'll take you.

961
01:15:32,550 --> 01:15:33,717
No.

962
01:15:35,883 --> 01:15:38,592
Why start now?

963
01:16:52,008 --> 01:16:54,217
<i>I concentrated on my work.</i>

964
01:16:54,675 --> 01:16:58,092
<i>I kept asking myself if it was right</i>

965
01:16:58,633 --> 01:17:03,133
<i>not to go to that fucked up
graduation party of hers.</i>

966
01:17:08,300 --> 01:17:11,508
<i>It took two years but I finally got
past the death of George.</i>

967
01:17:12,425 --> 01:17:15,758
<i>I even accepted the loss of Consuela.</i>

968
01:17:16,217 --> 01:17:19,633
<i>I recovered my equilibrium
and my independence.</i>

969
01:17:23,758 --> 01:17:25,800
<i>Who am I kidding?</i>

970
01:17:40,133 --> 01:17:42,258
The paintings and sculptures
of the day

971
01:17:42,758 --> 01:17:45,675
would literally and figuratively
absorb the energy.

972
01:17:46,050 --> 01:17:49,508
They were almost a self-contained
slice of life, if you will.

973
01:17:50,050 --> 01:17:53,008
That, you put beautifully

974
01:17:53,425 --> 01:17:55,217
in your opening chapter.

975
01:17:55,592 --> 01:17:58,050
But also you're making a comment

976
01:17:58,383 --> 01:17:59,925
on the relationship
between art and ownership.

977
01:18:00,383 --> 01:18:01,425
Well, that's exactly right.

978
01:18:01,883 --> 01:18:05,967
The people who buy these paintings,
they think that they own the pictures.

979
01:18:06,425 --> 01:18:09,050
But, in reality, the pictures own them.

980
01:18:09,425 --> 01:18:11,300
The pictures own them.

981
01:18:11,842 --> 01:18:13,383
they're allowed to live,
they're allowed to house them all.

982
01:18:13,842 --> 01:18:15,842
They're really custodians for

983
01:18:16,175 --> 01:18:18,717
a period of time.
They're free to admire it,

984
01:18:19,008 --> 01:18:20,758
- they're free to worship it if they like...
- In theory...

985
01:18:21,175 --> 01:18:23,842
- you could purchase the Great Pyramid.
- I take your point.

986
01:18:24,217 --> 01:18:27,883
But at the end of the day, the pyramid
will still be around and you'll be...

987
01:18:28,967 --> 01:18:30,800
With the Pharaohs.

988
01:18:31,300 --> 01:18:32,342
My guest today

989
01:18:32,883 --> 01:18:35,217
is Susan Reese, her novel is
"Blue Hyacinth."

990
01:18:35,592 --> 01:18:36,592
This is "Book Chat"

991
01:18:36,883 --> 01:18:38,217
I'm David Kapesh.

992
01:18:39,383 --> 01:18:41,425
Then that's it, that was lovely.
Thank you.

993
01:18:42,092 --> 01:18:43,467
Not too painful.

994
01:18:43,925 --> 01:18:45,300
Indeed!

995
01:18:49,050 --> 01:18:50,175
Thank you.

996
01:18:50,925 --> 01:18:53,342
- Oh, and happy New Year.
- Thank you and congratulations.

997
01:18:53,717 --> 01:18:55,550
It's a really... it's a good read.

998
01:18:56,675 --> 01:18:57,717
Thank you.

999
01:19:18,883 --> 01:19:20,342
One new message.

1000
01:19:20,758 --> 01:19:23,717
Six saved messages.
The first new message.

1001
01:19:27,550 --> 01:19:29,842
Hi, David, it's Consuela.

1002
01:19:30,217 --> 01:19:31,633
How are you?

1003
01:19:32,467 --> 01:19:35,717
Feels strange to call you, but...

1004
01:19:37,175 --> 01:19:39,842
I want to talk to you,
I want to tell you something.

1005
01:19:41,258 --> 01:19:43,967
I want to tell you myself
before you...

1006
01:19:44,467 --> 01:19:47,342
hear it from someone else.
I don't know...

1007
01:19:48,842 --> 01:19:51,300
Please, call when you can.
My cellphone number is

1008
01:19:51,633 --> 01:19:53,508
555-0122.

1009
01:19:54,342 --> 01:19:56,008
Please call.
Thanks. Bye.

1010
01:19:57,925 --> 01:19:59,883
Hi, David, it's Consuela.

1011
01:20:00,258 --> 01:20:05,425
I realized that I lived all these years
just to listen to these words.

1012
01:20:07,133 --> 01:20:10,258
I collapsed to the floor,
listening to her message,

1013
01:20:10,550 --> 01:20:14,675
again and again, fearing the worst.

1014
01:20:16,925 --> 01:20:20,008
She was in love, she was getting married.

1015
01:20:20,592 --> 01:20:23,300
Perhaps she even wanted my blessing.

1016
01:20:36,550 --> 01:20:38,467
David?

1017
01:20:40,550 --> 01:20:42,467
David...

1018
01:20:43,592 --> 01:20:44,883
Where are you?

1019
01:20:46,425 --> 01:20:50,800
I'm in the car. I was in front of your
building when I left the message.

1020
01:20:51,883 --> 01:20:54,800
What are you doing driving around
New York on New Year's Eve?

1021
01:20:56,550 --> 01:20:58,133
I don't know.

1022
01:20:59,717 --> 01:21:01,758
I don't know what I'm doing.

1023
01:21:02,175 --> 01:21:04,842
What's the matter, Consuela?

1024
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:08,592
I need to see you.

1025
01:21:09,050 --> 01:21:11,008
Then come.

1026
01:21:11,675 --> 01:21:13,717
- Do you have time?
- Always.

1027
01:21:14,008 --> 01:21:17,008
- Okay. I'm coming now.
- Yes.

1028
01:21:47,842 --> 01:21:48,633
Hi.

1029
01:21:49,217 --> 01:21:51,092
Hi.

1030
01:22:12,133 --> 01:22:13,467
So...

1031
01:22:14,717 --> 01:22:16,550
how have you been?

1032
01:22:20,925 --> 01:22:22,508
That one's new.

1033
01:22:23,383 --> 01:22:24,633
Yeah, it's...

1034
01:22:24,967 --> 01:22:27,092
Edward Weston.

1035
01:22:29,383 --> 01:22:31,425
I like your hair.

1036
01:22:33,342 --> 01:22:36,175
I cut a little each day.

1037
01:22:37,425 --> 01:22:40,883
So when it disappears
I won't miss it as much.

1038
01:22:57,342 --> 01:22:59,008
I'm sick.

1039
01:23:01,425 --> 01:23:03,217
I have...

1040
01:23:04,508 --> 01:23:06,633
cancer, breast cancer.

1041
01:23:14,758 --> 01:23:16,967
I'm having surgery in two weeks.

1042
01:23:17,300 --> 01:23:19,008
Cancer?

1043
01:23:20,092 --> 01:23:21,425
This is...

1044
01:23:23,592 --> 01:23:25,008
Are you...?

1045
01:23:25,383 --> 01:23:26,592
Afraid? No.

1046
01:23:27,175 --> 01:23:28,425
- No?
- Not exactly.

1047
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:31,550
That's not what I meant.
I meant...

1048
01:23:33,550 --> 01:23:35,175
What happened?

1049
01:23:39,550 --> 01:23:42,633
I was in the shower one morning and I...

1050
01:23:43,092 --> 01:23:44,800
I felt this...

1051
01:23:45,050 --> 01:23:47,300
thing under my arm.

1052
01:23:47,592 --> 01:23:52,592
So I went to the doctor and he said
it was probably nothing to worry about.

1053
01:23:53,092 --> 01:23:55,425
I went to a second doctor
and a third doctor and...

1054
01:23:55,842 --> 01:23:57,467
You know the story.

1055
01:23:58,092 --> 01:24:00,008
The third doctor said

1056
01:24:00,550 --> 01:24:02,967
it was something to worry about.

1057
01:24:03,508 --> 01:24:05,175
And did you panic?

1058
01:24:06,967 --> 01:24:08,842
Yes, I panicked.

1059
01:24:09,383 --> 01:24:13,425
I spent a whole month in pure fear.

1060
01:24:13,842 --> 01:24:15,967
Tonight I was going

1061
01:24:16,217 --> 01:24:18,425
to go to this party,

1062
01:24:18,800 --> 01:24:22,008
thinking it would be better than
staying by myself, but...

1063
01:24:24,300 --> 01:24:26,133
David...

1064
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:27,925
David, no.

1065
01:24:28,300 --> 01:24:29,633
Don't cry.

1066
01:24:30,550 --> 01:24:32,633
Do not cry.

1067
01:24:34,758 --> 01:24:38,758
Why didn't you call me? Why didn't
you call me when this happened?

1068
01:24:42,217 --> 01:24:43,717
I couldn't tell you.

1069
01:24:44,883 --> 01:24:47,508
I couldn't tell you of all people.

1070
01:24:50,008 --> 01:24:51,633
You know what's funny?

1071
01:24:53,467 --> 01:24:56,342
I feel older than you now.

1072
01:24:56,925 --> 01:25:00,008
You promise me one thing,
that if you should ever

1073
01:25:00,383 --> 01:25:04,717
start to panic, during the night or during
the day or any time, you'll phone me.

1074
01:25:06,967 --> 01:25:08,217
What can I do?

1075
01:25:09,092 --> 01:25:10,217
What can I do?

1076
01:25:15,842 --> 01:25:17,008
It's...

1077
01:25:24,842 --> 01:25:28,175
It's like not being able...

1078
01:25:28,550 --> 01:25:31,217
to get into a...

1079
01:25:31,550 --> 01:25:34,217
a comfortable position, because

1080
01:25:34,592 --> 01:25:38,258
no matter which way you turn,
you're stuck.

1081
01:25:40,050 --> 01:25:42,175
I'm stuck inside myself.

1082
01:25:51,217 --> 01:25:56,050
When I think of all the things
I used to think were so important,

1083
01:25:56,508 --> 01:25:58,842
All the arguments I got
into with my mom,

1084
01:25:59,717 --> 01:26:02,842
It's stupid all the time I wasted.

1085
01:26:03,217 --> 01:26:04,842
sleeping...

1086
01:26:05,342 --> 01:26:08,383
sleeping my life away.

1087
01:26:17,300 --> 01:26:18,342
David...

1088
01:26:22,258 --> 01:26:24,050
I need to ask you a favor.

1089
01:26:25,467 --> 01:26:27,425
Something I can only ask you.

1090
01:26:29,342 --> 01:26:32,008
Anything.
What is it?

1091
01:26:43,633 --> 01:26:45,217
After you,

1092
01:26:46,633 --> 01:26:49,467
I never had a boyfriend.

1093
01:26:52,508 --> 01:26:55,967
who loved my body
as much as you did.

1094
01:26:56,258 --> 01:26:58,092
I find that hard to believe.

1095
01:26:59,258 --> 01:27:01,050
Were there many?

1096
01:27:02,217 --> 01:27:03,717
No.

1097
01:27:04,133 --> 01:27:06,592
What about work?
Never fooled around at work?

1098
01:27:06,925 --> 01:27:08,925
- they all did.
- Well of course they did.

1099
01:27:11,092 --> 01:27:14,425
I just wasn't interested.

1100
01:27:20,342 --> 01:27:21,883
I know you loved me.

1101
01:27:23,425 --> 01:27:26,008
And you loved my body.

1102
01:27:27,383 --> 01:27:29,342
So...

1103
01:27:30,133 --> 01:27:31,508
before the doctors...

1104
01:27:33,050 --> 01:27:34,883
- ruin it...
- Stop.

1105
01:27:35,467 --> 01:27:38,800
Stop talking that way and
stop thinking that way.

1106
01:27:39,300 --> 01:27:41,717
Consuela no-one's going to ruin you.

1107
01:27:48,633 --> 01:27:50,217
Consuela...

1108
01:27:52,050 --> 01:27:54,383
What is it you want me to do?

1109
01:30:34,342 --> 01:30:36,258
That's the Paris Opera House.

1110
01:30:43,800 --> 01:30:45,217
I missed you.

1111
01:30:48,175 --> 01:30:50,883
I missed all the places
we never went.

1112
01:31:11,217 --> 01:31:13,050
Would you like to stay here
tonight?

1113
01:31:19,258 --> 01:31:20,217
No.

1114
01:31:22,467 --> 01:31:23,717
I have to go.

1115
01:31:28,383 --> 01:31:31,675
Would you like me to go with you
when you go to the hospital?

1116
01:31:35,050 --> 01:31:36,425
Consuela...

1117
01:31:38,175 --> 01:31:40,342
You can't do this alone.

1118
01:31:43,800 --> 01:31:45,133
Why do you say that?

1119
01:31:45,925 --> 01:31:48,133
You do everything alone.

1120
01:31:56,175 --> 01:31:57,633
David...

1121
01:31:58,258 --> 01:31:59,717
Poor man.

1122
01:32:01,925 --> 01:32:04,008
You're more scared than me.

1123
01:32:14,508 --> 01:32:18,133
Will you still want to fuck
me if I lose my breast?

1124
01:32:22,008 --> 01:32:23,508
Will you be up for that?

1125
01:32:24,550 --> 01:32:25,883
Will you?

1126
01:32:42,508 --> 01:32:43,842
I'm sorry David.

1127
01:32:47,133 --> 01:32:48,925
Really sorry.

1128
01:32:55,383 --> 01:32:57,092
I'm scared, David.

1129
01:32:57,633 --> 01:33:01,175
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

1130
01:33:01,883 --> 01:33:04,133
Happy New Year!

1131
01:33:21,050 --> 01:33:22,633
Happy New Year.

1132
01:34:29,592 --> 01:34:31,467
- Dad...
- Hi.

1133
01:34:31,800 --> 01:34:32,925
What are you doing here?

1134
01:34:33,300 --> 01:34:35,133
I wondered if you could
spare me a few minutes?

1135
01:34:36,633 --> 01:34:39,258
- er...

1136
01:34:40,925 --> 01:34:42,217
Alright, come here.

1137
01:34:45,925 --> 01:34:46,925
Yep, uhuh.

1138
01:34:48,342 --> 01:34:50,967
Thanks, I owe you one.

1139
01:34:51,717 --> 01:34:52,758
Bye.

1140
01:34:55,592 --> 01:34:57,217
She's in very good hands.

1141
01:34:57,592 --> 01:34:59,383
- I know her surgeon.
- And?

1142
01:34:59,800 --> 01:35:01,217
They're going to operate tomorrow.

1143
01:35:01,717 --> 01:35:03,592
She told me in two weeks.

1144
01:35:04,467 --> 01:35:05,383
No.

1145
01:35:05,800 --> 01:35:08,800
- They're going to do it tomorrow.
- What does that mean?

1146
01:35:09,175 --> 01:35:10,675
I'm not her doctor. So...

1147
01:35:11,467 --> 01:35:14,508
I don't know exactly, but it's
probably not a good thing.

1148
01:35:16,633 --> 01:35:18,300
It's a nightmare.

1149
01:35:23,050 --> 01:35:24,592
Have you known her long?

1150
01:35:25,258 --> 01:35:28,092
I hadn't seen her for a couple of years.

1151
01:35:28,092 --> 01:35:30,967
She called me out of the blue
on New Year's Eve with the news.

1152
01:35:33,467 --> 01:35:38,092
I've got all her phone numbers, but I
don't want to make the wrong move here.

1153
01:35:39,050 --> 01:35:40,425
She... when she left...

1154
01:35:40,883 --> 01:35:44,467
she told me she didn't want me to call her.
She was quite definite about that.

1155
01:35:47,800 --> 01:35:48,758
I'm sorry.

1156
01:35:49,717 --> 01:35:52,758
Yep, I know, I'm coming.

1157
01:35:54,675 --> 01:35:56,342
I'm sorry to have barged
in on you like this.

1158
01:35:56,342 --> 01:35:57,925
I know you're strapped for time.

1159
01:35:58,383 --> 01:36:01,550
I'm sorry I couldn't be of more help.
Stay strong.

1160
01:36:02,300 --> 01:36:04,092
That's what you tell your patients.

1161
01:36:05,383 --> 01:36:09,383
It must be really tough. Oncology.

1162
01:36:09,758 --> 01:36:12,758
I was your son.
I was prepared for it.

1163
01:36:13,092 --> 01:36:14,800
- I'm glad to see you again.
- Yeah.

1164
01:36:15,175 --> 01:36:18,133
- And I'm sorry that it was under such uh...
- Me too.

1165
01:36:18,550 --> 01:36:20,883
How are things at home?

1166
01:36:21,217 --> 01:36:22,967
We're still together.

1167
01:36:23,258 --> 01:36:24,758
Thanks for asking.

1168
01:36:25,133 --> 01:36:26,592
I'm glad to hear it.

1169
01:36:31,092 --> 01:36:32,592
Dad...

1170
01:36:35,717 --> 01:36:37,633
What are you gonna do?

1171
01:36:51,550 --> 01:36:53,050
Why did she have me
take these photographs?

1172
01:36:53,050 --> 01:36:54,550
Did she want them for herself?

1173
01:36:55,467 --> 01:37:00,008
Or did she intend for me to keep them?

1174
01:37:01,550 --> 01:37:03,467
Well that makes sense.

1175
01:37:03,967 --> 01:37:06,675
Did I ever tell you my theory
about beautiful girls?

1176
01:37:07,050 --> 01:37:08,508
A million times.

1177
01:37:08,925 --> 01:37:10,508
No-one can see them.

1178
01:37:11,717 --> 01:37:12,717
Well?

1179
01:37:13,175 --> 01:37:15,342
Did you ever see her?

1180
01:37:16,008 --> 01:37:18,342
I mean all of her.

1181
01:37:18,758 --> 01:37:20,842
I didn't understand what I saw.

1182
01:37:22,175 --> 01:37:24,050
A lawyer's answer.

1183
01:37:24,467 --> 01:37:26,342
You're over-analysing it.

1184
01:37:26,717 --> 01:37:28,717
Who would end a relationship

1185
01:37:29,300 --> 01:37:31,883
because I missed her graduation party.

1186
01:37:32,300 --> 01:37:35,717
She was this weird clutch
of inconsistencies.

1187
01:37:36,133 --> 01:37:39,175
You're talking about her in the past tense.

1188
01:37:47,425 --> 01:37:49,717
So do you think they will let me in today?

1189
01:37:50,133 --> 01:37:53,800
She just got out of intensive care.
You can go today.

1190
01:37:54,550 --> 01:37:56,342
Kenny, thank you.

1191
01:37:56,675 --> 01:37:58,050
You're welcome.

1192
01:38:01,008 --> 01:38:03,550
Time passes when you're not looking.

1193
01:39:13,342 --> 01:39:14,633
David...

1194
01:39:15,092 --> 01:39:16,342
Yes.

1195
01:39:20,342 --> 01:39:23,008
They took the whole thing.

1196
01:39:29,217 --> 01:39:31,258
I didn't think you would come.

1197
01:39:32,383 --> 01:39:33,675
Why?

1198
01:39:39,342 --> 01:39:41,425
Why did you think that?

1199
01:39:43,258 --> 01:39:46,092
Because I'm no longer beautiful.

1200
01:39:46,592 --> 01:39:48,092
Yes you are.

1201
01:39:51,717 --> 01:39:53,758
You know Hipolita,
the beautiful Amazonian queen?

1202
01:39:54,258 --> 01:39:56,592
She actually cut off her right breast

1203
01:39:56,967 --> 01:40:03,258
so she could shoot her arrows faster
and she was no slouch.

1204
01:40:15,883 --> 01:40:20,508
Will the book be different if
we read it 10 years later?

1205
01:40:21,967 --> 01:40:25,425
You remember my first class.

1206
01:40:30,633 --> 01:40:34,800
- I remember everything.
- Me too.

1207
01:40:35,508 --> 01:40:37,383
Every second.

1208
01:40:48,258 --> 01:40:50,342
I'm gonna miss you.

1209
01:41:13,758 --> 01:41:15,383
I'm here.
