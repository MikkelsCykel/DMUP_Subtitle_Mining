00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:51,720
For me to talk about the man
I have become, you need
to know about the man I was.

3
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,320
I was 14 when I joined
the Tartan Gangs

4
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,680
and I was 15 when I joined the UVF,
the Ulster Volunteer Force.

5
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:05,760
At that time, don't forget,
there were riots on the streets,

6
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,840
every week, petrol bombs every day
and that was just in our town.

7
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:15,440
When you got home and switched on the
TV, you could see it was happening
in every other town as well.

8
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:18,480
And it was like we were under siege.

9
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:25,520
Fathers and brothers of friends
were being killed in the streets.

10
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,440
And the feeling was,
we all have to do something.

11
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,720
We're all in this together
and we all have to do something.

He's wanting us to dig his gardens.

Right, this is what's going down.

92
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:19,120
You know Colin who works at Castle's
Yard... Aye, the stonemasons?

93
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,800
The Provies told him that if he
didn't leave, he'd be stiffed,

94
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:26,560
so I sent the message back,
"If you don't leave,
it's one of youse who'll be stiffed."

95
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,560
They haven't withdrawn the threat.

96
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,200
So this is our first kill, boys.

97
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:39,360
I told Sammy that I wanted to do it.
He said he'd check and see if there
was anything else going down tonight.

98
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,520
He came back to me
and said it was good to go.

99
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:46,120
"The hit's yours," he said.
He told me I could pick up the piece.
Where from?

100
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:49,320
You don't ask that.
Let's see it, Alistair. Aye, goWhat is it?

101
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:53,200
It's a 38. Smith and Wesson.
Could you not get an automatic?

102
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,440
Nah, Stuart, this is better than
automatics, they jam all the time.

103
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:59,800
With this, you know, it's not going
to leave me there fucking clicking,

104
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:04,720
you know, standing there
with a dick in my hand. Aye.How many rounds did you get?

105
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,720
Enough.

106
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,320
He must be reckoning we're good
then to be getting a hit.

107
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,840
Well, this is the one I asked for
so we better be. What did he say,

108
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,160
Sammy,
when he said the hit was ours?

109
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:21,840
He just looked us in the eyes like
he was, you know, he was proud of us.

110
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:27,080
I'm telling you, it was
a good feeling. We'll be walking into
that bar ten foot tall now, eh?

111
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,840
I can't wait for that.

119
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,280
Griffin.

120
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:01,120
Griffin? He was warned to leave
the yard by the end of the week.

121
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,240
Hang on, Jim Griffin.

122
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,560
Aye. I know him. That's right.

00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,360
Albert Street, aren't they?

124
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,640
He's leaving the yard anyway,
isn't he? Setting out on his own?

125
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:14,640
Griffin, is he?
That's what I'm hearing.

126
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:18,440
Oh, you meanAye,
that's what I'm hearing.

127
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,000
Hang on, can't be here in Lurgan.

128
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,400
Surely now, not two masons' yards
in the one town?

129
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,800
They're going to be up
and running by Christmas.

130
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:31,880
That's what I'm hearing. Well, he's
still in Castle's now. So that's bad
luck on him then. I know his mother.

131
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,360
She's our dinner lady
at the apprenticeship.

132
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:38,120
Aye, I know the woman you mean.
I don't know her, like,
but I know who you mean.

133
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,320
Sure her sister Catherine
works in the bread shop.

134
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,440
So is that her son we're doing?It's not Albert Street.

135
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,160
They used to be, I'm sure of it.It's Hill Street.

we burn the gear,

145
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:25,760
we call Sammy and we go to the hop.
We get seen around, a few dances
and then we're back home.

146
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,640
Let's go.

147
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,680
37? You sure?

148
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:39,760
Aye, it's left.

149
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,120
Army! Down!

150
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,160
What's happened?

151
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,320
They're passing.

Go left then.

154
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,160
Just take us round the block, Andy.
We'll come at it again.

155
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,800
Oh, fuck! What is it?

156
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,400
Lights have gone red. Where are
the jeeps? We're right behind them.What?!

157
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,880
Are they staying in the vehicle?
So far.

158
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:25,480
Alistair,
this has got to be a no-goer.

Aye, do you want to get out of here?No, don't! No!

161
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:33,480

Are they doing anything?
They're just sitting there.

Stop it, Mummy! Stop it!

You could have stopped him
with a milk bottle or something!

Please, Mummy! Stop it, Mummy,
please? Please?

Why didn't you? You killed him!

205

You killed him! NO! Ssh!

206
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:12,680
NO! NO!

00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,880
Sorry, what did you say? What?

212
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:40,280
Did you not just say something?

213
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,160
Was I talking to myself?

214
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:45,440
It gets me a good seat. I've had
no-one sitting next to me for years.

One on one. For fuck's sake.

I mean, for fuck's sake.

217
00:20:56,680 --> 00:21:00,280
Would you turn back?Are you wanting me to turn back?

218
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:04,040
I'd love you for it. I think
I should get you there first,
don't you?

219
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:09,360
I can take you back when I've gotI'd rather eat my two

Do you want me to call them?
I can call them.

No, you go on. You do your job.

224
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:47,160
They said to get you there.

225
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:52,760
And what? And what? Well, I know
you have to get me there,
that's why you're driving me there.

226
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:55,720
I mean did you say
you wouldn't get me there?

227
00:21:55,720 --> 00:22:00,720
You mean they mean I wouldn't
get you there, that's why you
have to get me there? Is that it?

228
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,240
It's something like that.

229
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:07,320
No, you drive, you do your job.

230

Do you mind? I don't want you
getting in trouble.

231

I mean, Jesus,
I'm in trouble, I can't have you in

Aye, that's the one!That worked out quite nicely.

236
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:46,240
So,
did they show it in the end then?

237
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,720
They did, about six months ago now.

238
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:56,320
I was looking out for it.Actually, I didn't see it myself.
I was in South Africa at the time.

the Dalai fucking Lama

No. Well, kind of.

254
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:10,200
It's a programme
about reconciliation.

Have you not met him yet? No.

259
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,880
No, not since the day.

260
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:32,680
Well, did you ask for this?

261
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:35,960
That was never
going to be my call, Ray.

262
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:38,440
I don't have the right
to ask anything from him.

263
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:41,560
So did he call you or...?

264
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:44,480
No, the programme people,
they approached him.

265
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,840
Then me.

you know.

willing t-t-to do it, to see him.

268
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,720
I'd do anything to...

You know, to...

270
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:08,200
Did you do time for it, Alistair?Aye.

271

There was no release date
but I did 12 years.

00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:41,200
Would I need a driving licence?

307
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,920
HE CHUCKLES

308
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:45,920
There's always
a snag somewhere, eh?

309

312
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:02,800

313

'Three bullets went into his head.
You'd know that, though.

314
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:08,960
'Did you know another one
hit a picture of a cat on the wall?

315
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,720
'It wasn't me
who broke that picture,
I never got the blame for that one,

316
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:17,280
'and if it wasn't me who broke
the picture on the wall,
it wasn't me who killed my brother.

317
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:20,840
'I didn't kill him

in the car now, visiting you.

322

'I'm the one in the car now.'

323
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:36,160
I'm the one in the car now.

324
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:45,080
Is this it? This is it.

325
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,960
Yes, it's Paul here.

326
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:54,360
We're just coming in now.

327
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,240
..Yes, he is.

328
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,760
Right.

329
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:01,360
Jesus, will you look
at this place?

330
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:23,640
Joe, hi! How are you?

331
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,640
Aye, good! Good.

332
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:29,240
You've made good time, well done!I was just sitting in the back.

333
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:32,400
This is David, Michael's assistant.Pleased to meet you.

334
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:36,400
Hi. Come on inside
and we'll find Michael.

335
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,760
It'll be grand.

336
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,120
Michael is this way, Mr Griffin.

337
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:45,160
HUBBUB

338
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:48,920
Mr Griffin is stepping
into the house.

339
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:53,360
It's an interesting staircase.
You sort of expect Bette Davis
to come sweeping down it.

340
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,800
I could move in here.

341
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:59,120
It's yours for one day, at any rate.
We've set up a room
for you upstairs to relax in.

342
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,680
Come in and meet the crew. Aye.

343
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:06,400
Joe, you know Stephanie, don't you?

344
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:09,400
They didn't tell me you'd arrived.
It's good to see you.

345
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:12,480
Aye, you too.John, video technician.

346
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:15,960
Pleased to meet you. Hello.Martin, camera. Hello.

347
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:20,840
'Well, here you are, pal.
A fully signed up member of the
celebrity circuit of Life's Victims.

348
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:24,320
'Men in love with donkeys, twins
stuck together by their bollocks,

349
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:28,840
'elephant women who can't get
out of their chairs, and now you.'

350
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,080
I know, it's all a bit, you know...

351
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,880
But they're all lovely people,

352
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:36,920
and they're very experienced
at this sort of thing.

353
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:39,240
Fiona'll take you upstairs. Yeah.

354
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,760
OK, this way.

355
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,360
So, did you get that
poor old toaster sorted out?

356
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:53,800
When we last spoke on the phone,
were you not sorting out a toaster?

357
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,360
Oh, aye.

358
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,840
Here we are.

359
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,760
Isn't it gorgeous?

360
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:07,640
Can I smoke? Um...yeah.

361
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,920
Over there on the balcony.

362
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:13,040
Now, what can I get you? Tea or
coffee? Tea would be nice, aye.

363
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,560
Yeah? Milk, sugar?

364
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:17,000
Aye, milk, two sugars. Thank you.No problem.

365
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:29,640
Joe...

366
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:35,920
How are you?Yeah, good. Aye, I'm good.

367
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:38,360
Thank you so much for coming.That's OK, aye.

368
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:41,120
How are you feeling?Aye, I'm OK. I'm OK, aye.

369
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,920
Everybody looking after you? Aye.

370
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:47,720
Good. I know it's going to be
a difficult day for you.

371
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:50,800
But we will do everything we
can to make sure it's, you know,

372
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,400
it goes the way you want it to.

373
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:55,000
So, if there's anything you need,
any questions,

374
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,120
anything you're worried about,
you just stop us and, well,

375
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,760
basically, we're here for you.

376
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,280
OK. So it's very important

377
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:04,040
that you let us know if things
aren't feeling right.

378
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:07,880
Now, has Fiona taken you through
the format and so forth? Aye.

379
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,320
OK, good.

380
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:13,400
Just to briefly
put you in the picture on how
the day is going to pan out...

381
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:17,160
Now, you've got time to settle down
here and make yourself comfortable.

382
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:20,080
Will you have someone
in the bed for me?

383
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:24,640
Then, at some point, a make-up girl
will come in just to put a little,

384
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,200
you know, on your face.

385
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:29,480
Sometimes the camera
can make the skin shine.

386
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,280
So, she only needs a few minutes.

387
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:35,000
Then, when you're ready,
we'll do a little shooting...

388
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,040
filming, up here.

389
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:40,240
And then, at around 12,
you know, when it feels right,

390
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:43,800
we can go downstairs and...
you've seen the room, haven't you?

391
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:46,440
Aye. OK, good.

392
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:51,320
So, in terms of
your actual meeting with him,

393
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:54,920
it's important to remember,
for all of us to remember,

394
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:58,200
where we are trying to get to
in this programme - the truth.

395
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,000
'Yes, I know, I know what you want.

396
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,760
'Shake his fucking hand
and we can all go home.'

397
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:07,240
The last thing I want to do
is push you into areas of your mind
where you don't want to go.

398
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:11,200
But it's important for us to
understand all the emotions in this.

399
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,000
Do you understand what I'm saying?

400
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,160
Aye. Aye, I understand.I know it's difficult.

401
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:19,000
Which is why
I don't want to push that,

402
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,600
but I do want you
to be truthful with how you feel.

403
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:25,800
What I'm saying really is,
I just want you to be you.

404
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,720
KNOCK ON DOOR

405
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:29,280
Michael? Yeah.

406
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,880
Sorry. Yeah, I'm coming.

407
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:37,280
And you know, we are all
going to have an important day here.

408
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,080
I can't tell you how important

409
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:41,400
I think this is going to be
in terms of...

410
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:44,440
well,
in terms of what it's going to do.

411
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:47,200
This is the question
we are all wanting the answer to.

412
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:50,520
Truth and reconciliation.

413
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:52,360
What's at stake?

414
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,880
Is it possible?

415
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:59,240
That's it. Speech over.

416
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:06,440
'I can do handshakes, Michael!
And I can do victim.

417
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:09,520
'I can do handshake and victim
both at the same time.

418
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:12,200
'But I've made a decision
on this one.

419
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:15,080
'Reconciliation?

420
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:17,040
'You have no idea.'

421
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,560
A handshake?

422
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:22,600
For killing my brother?
For me taking the blame?

423
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,680
33 years of that?

424
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:27,160
What do you think I am, a joke?

425
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:32,160
'If ever a man deserved
a knife run through him,
that scum of the earth.

426
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,040
'Truth and reconciliation?'

427
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,680
'I'm going for revenge.'

428
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:57,320
Oh, hi. I'm Vika.
Joe. How are you doing?

429
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,720
Your tea. Oh, aye. Thanks.

430
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:01,280
I'm the runner. The runner?

431
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,520
Do you mind
if I have a smoke out there?

432
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,560
Oh, no, no, no...

433
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,800
No, no, of course you can!
Come on, come on.

434
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,480
Here, have one of mine.It's OK, I...

435
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,920
No, Jesus, come on! Thank you.

436
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,520
Here.

437
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:29,160
Thank you.

438
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:33,120
You stay out here with me andThanks, but I...

439
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:35,920
I'm the star of the show.
You have to do what I say!

440
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:38,800
I've come to look after you
anyway, so... That's great!

441
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:43,920
Everyone's looking after me! They're
even worrying about my toaster.

442
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:50,280
You're a what? A runner?Yeah, it means I run around

443
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,280
A dogsbody, then! A dogsbody?

444
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:55,840
No, no! Runner's better -
I like runner.

445
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:14,880
Young Fiona here visited me
out of the blue one morning,

446
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,920
said she was a researcher
on a programme called One On One.

447
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:21,280
She was all posh and lovely, her
voice is all up here and down there

448
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,560
and the weather's
always doing something,

449
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:25,800
and every time she turns,
she smiles at me.

450
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:29,360
Would she smile at me
if she didn't know me and
I sat down next to her in the pub?

451
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,560
She'd call the police.

452
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:35,120
Ah! Fuck, I would! So, anyway,

453
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:37,240
And now look
what I've got myself into.

454
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:46,640
Maybe it's a good thing
you are here. Aye. Maybe it is.

455
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,920
Where are you from?

456
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,400
Vladivostok.

457
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:57,560
Vladivostok AND Belfast?
Does bad luck run in your family?

458
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:59,440
I like it here.

459
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,480
I like you here too. I like you!

460
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:03,680
So, she was sitting in my kitchen,
she says,

461
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,320
this is an important programme

462
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:07,920
about men who have become the man
they have become,

463
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,160
that you have become,
or some fuck-knows thing.

464
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:12,560
Then she said it's more about
the man you could become.

465
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:15,320
"That's what excites us all
about this project," she said.

466
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:17,600
She had the light in her eyes,
the missionary light.

467
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:20,520
"It's about healing", she said.
"It's about reconciliation."

468
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:23,240
"What is that?" I said.
"People coming out of their graves?"

469
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:25,480
"No", she said, smiling.
"That's resurrection."

470
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:28,360
We want you to meet the man who
killed your brother, face to face.

471
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:37,120
I don't know. The thing is, it isn't
the way she was looking and talking,

472
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:40,400
and I wasn't really listening
to anything she was telling me.

473
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:43,000
It's just that...

474
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,240
she showed me a little kindness.

475
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:50,360
Well, I'm sure...
But I don't do kindness.

476
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:52,920
I fucking hate kindness.
I don't let that in.

477
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,600
I let it in then, but never again.

478
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:05,280
The trouble with me is,
I've got all the wrong feelings.

479
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,360
But him? Oh, his feelings?

480
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:10,920
They are just right, just perfect!

481
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:13,960
He did it in cold blood, but now
look at the man he has become!

482
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:17,920
"What is it like to kill a man,"
they all ask him?
"Well, you have to understand..."

483
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,640
And off he goes again, telling
them all about this and that.

484
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,680
But hats off to him,
he's cracked it!

485
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:26,120
He knows they all love
to shake hands with a killer.

486
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:31,480
Is there someone with him? Oh, yes.Yes. That's important, you know?

487
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:33,960
Whatever he tells you
he's feeling about this,

488
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:36,440
he's going to be very angry.
I mean, very angry.

489
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:39,080
That anger could go in any direction.
I understand that.

490
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:41,840
You have to be prepared
to stop the filming at any moment.

491
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,640
We're not performing monkeys. No.

492
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:45,680
I realise
you have a programme to make

493
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,840
but what's happening to him
has to come first.

494
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:51,000
Yes, absolutely. You have to make
sure he doesn't come to any harm.

495
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:56,000
"Listen to him", they will say,
"and there is hope in the world!"
And you know what he's thinking?

496
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,200
"Do this gig well here
and I've got another 20 years
of pay cheques in front of me.

497
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:03,320
"I can talk about that day then and
this day now for the next 20 years,

498
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:05,680
"how I came face to face
with the brother of my victim,

499
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:09,280
"and how it was
the final act in my journey
towards a magnificent redemption,

500
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:12,000
"and how listening to me is
the way forward in life, plus VAT.

501
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,800
"And with their cheques
in my pocket, I will talk
unto the wretched of the world

502
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,880
"and I will heal them with my words,

503
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:20,840
"I won't have to work in a fucking
egg carton factory ever again."

504
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:23,200
So!

505
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,680
The man shot my brother
three times in the head.

506
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:28,400
The man is having the life of Riley.
What should I do?

507
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,720
Do I shake his hand
or do I kill him?

508
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:38,640
Well, killing him
wouldn't be good for him.

509
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:43,040
For sure of that! But it wouldn't
be good for you either.

510
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,040
Oh, not good for me?

511
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:51,400
My five minutes of heaven?

512
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:53,720
How would that be not good for me?

513
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:56,120
KNOCK ON DOOR

514
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:58,560
Joe, hi! Everything OK?
Aye. OK, aye.

515
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:02,640
They're just doing
a wee bit of filming downstairs
and then we're set to go, OK?

516
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:05,520
Can Cathy come in and do a wee bit
of make-up just to get you ready?

517
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,160
Aye. OK, aye. Hi, Joe.

518
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:09,240
I'm Cathy. How are you, all right?

519
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:11,360
Good, aye. I'm good. Lovely!

520
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:13,120
I just want to sit you down here.

521
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:16,520
There we go.

522
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:19,400
That's lovely.

523
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:23,480
Now, this is just
to take the shine off your skin.

524
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:24,880
Fuck, am I shining?

525
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:28,960
OK, Alistair, the camera's running,
so just in your own time.

526
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:36,720
In order for me...

527
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:41,120
In order for me to talk about
the man I have become,
you need to know about the man I was.

528
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:43,800
I was 14 when I joined
the Tartan Gangs

529
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:48,120
and I was 15 when I joined the UVF,
the Ulster Volunteer Force.

530
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:52,040
The situation at that time,
you know...

531
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:53,400
BANGING IN BACKGROUND

532
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:56,640
Cut there. Sorry, that's very good
but we're picking up some noise.

533
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,160
That's really good.

534
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:03,040
OK? OK, we're good to go again.

535
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:07,960
Running up.And in your own time, Alistair.

536
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:19,360
For me to talk about the man
I have become, you need to know
about the man I was.

537
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:21,600
I was 14
when I joined the Tartan Gangs

538
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:25,080
and I was 15 when I joined the UVF.

539
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:29,320
At that time, don't forget, there
were riots on the streets every week,

540
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:30,840
petrol bombs every day.

541
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,520
And that was just in our town.

542
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:34,640
When you got home
and switched on the TV,

543
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:37,640
you could see it was happening
in every other town as well,

544
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:39,960
and it was like we were under siege.

545
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:43,760
Fathers and brothers of friends
were being killed in the streets

546
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:46,520
and the feeling was,
we all have to do something.

547
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:50,520
We're all in this together
and we all have to do something.

548
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:53,320
The thing you have to remember,

549
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:56,400
what you have to understand,
is the mindset.

550
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:01,320
Once you have signed up to terror
and joined the organisation,

551
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:04,520
the group,
your mind closes right down.

552
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:06,680
It becomes only our story
that matters.

553
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:09,280
Not their story,
the Catholics.

554
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:12,560
It's only my people that are being
killed and who are suffering

555
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,080
and who need looking after.

556
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:16,680
Catholics being killed
doesn't enter your head.

557
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:21,560
And so when I went up to Sammy,
our local commander,

558
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:24,440
and told him
I wanted to kill a Catholic man,

559
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:26,840
it wasn't a wrong thing
for me to do.

560
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:32,040
In my head, it was the proper, the
just, the fair, the good thing to do.

561
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:33,560
And so it was easy.

562
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:38,560
When I got to the house,
there was a boy in the street.

563
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:42,920
I didn't expect him to be there,
but there he was.

564
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:45,720
I only looked at him for a moment
because I had a job to do.

565
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:48,960
But if I had known
that he was Jim's brother,

566
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:51,160
I would have shot him as well.

567
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:53,360
It was in the mindset.

568
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:56,680
It was tit for tat
and perhaps one more, why not?

569
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,240
That's what it was like.

570
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:03,000
I was only 17.

571
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:07,480
I had seen my people fighting
ever since I was a wee boy.

572
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:10,080
You take sides
with your friends as a boy,

573
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:12,760
but we weren't just throwing stones
over the fence -

574
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:14,240
we were shooting guns.

575
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:16,400
HE CLEARS HIS THROAT

576
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:19,560
What I want to tell people,
what society must do,

577
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:23,040
is to stop people getting to the
point where they join the group.

578
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:25,640
Because when you get to that point,
it's too late.

579
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:29,120
No-one's going to stop you.
No-one's going to change your mind.

580
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:32,160
And once you're in,
you will do anything.

581
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:37,000
You will kill anyone on the other
side because it's right to do it.

582
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:40,760
Once your man has joined the group,
society has lost him.

583
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:42,600
And what he needs to hear

584
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:46,920
are voices on his own side
stopping him before he goes in.

585
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:52,240
There were no voices on my side.
Not on my side of the town.

586
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:54,720
Not on my estate.

587
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:58,720
No-one was telling me anything
other than that killing is right.

588
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:02,520
It was only in prison
when I heard that other voice.

589
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:06,280
And the Muslims now, you know,
the kids now are like I was then.

590
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:08,080
They need to hear those voices now,

591
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:10,840
stopping them from thinking
that killing is good.

592
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:12,960
They need their own people
to say no.

593
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,720
That's where they need to hear it.

594
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,480
That's where I would put my money,

595
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:19,640
on making those voices heard
in every mosque in the country.

596
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:21,760
HE CLEARS HIS THROAT

597
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:26,800
When I got home, my mother
and father were watching the TV

598
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:30,080
and it came on the news
that the man I had shot was dead.

599
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:32,440
I was so excited
that I couldn't wait

600
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:35,120
for when I would get
my congratulations.

601
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:37,840
Sammy was going to come
knocking at my door.

602
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:40,280
He was going to lead me out
into the street

603
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:43,200
and proudly walk me into the bar

604
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:47,600
and everybody was going to stand up
and applaud me.

605
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:49,400
I would have shot anyone for that.

606
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:53,840
And that is why I talk to anybody
who will listen now,

607
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:56,320
to tell them to stop boys
like me thinking

608
00:45:56,320 --> 00:46:00,480
that to shoot an innocent
and a decent man in the head
is a good thing.

609
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:13,880
Alistair, when he comes into
the room, what are you hoping for?

610
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:18,480
Well, what I have to do
is to be honest with him.

611
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:22,440
That is the most difficult
thing, but that's what
he's going to need from me,

612
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:24,360
is to be honest with him.

613
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:28,600
Cut.

614
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:30,120
Good.

615
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:33,440
Fantastic.

616
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:42,480
Thank you. That was perfect. Yeah.

617
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:46,560
Once he's in the room with you,
do you think...?

618
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:51,160
I mean, is it likely
he'll want an apology from you?

619
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:53,120
Michael, Michael...

620
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:57,320
He doesn't want to hear me say
I'm sorry or to ask for forgiveness.

621
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:59,280
Reconciliation is not on the agenda.

622
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:00,720
That's not what he needs.

623
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:04,200
He has come here and I have come here
so he can confront me.

624
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:48,280
Hiya, Joe. Ah, here he is.

625
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:51,480
I wondered if I could sort you out
with a wee radio mike here?

626
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:54,000
Where are you putting that?How are we doing? Ready to go?

627
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,560
I just need to clip this on here.
I don't like that side.

628
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:58,160
How are you feeling? Aye, OK.

629
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:01,880
What about if I put it in here?
Is that better?

630
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:03,600
Thank you. You sure?

631
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:06,080
Aye, OK.Just need to clip this on here.

632
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:12,200
All right, that's it. OK. Good.

633
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:15,600
What we're gonna do now, we are
going to bring you downstairs.

634
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:18,920
Now, the cameraman will be filming
you but don't look at him...

635
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:20,600
SPEECH BECOMES MUFFLED

636
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:23,920
RAGGED BREATHING

637
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:26,120
..Joe?

638
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:27,920
Yeah, Joe?

639
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:29,360
Going downstairs, aye.

640
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:31,840
Now, when you open the door
and go into the room,

641
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:36,520
make sure you open the door wide
and leave it open.

642
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:38,120
OK? Aye.

643
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:41,880
What the cameraman
will be doing, he'll be
following you into the room,

644
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:44,840
and somebody else'll be
closing the door behind him, OK?

645
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:47,160
Aye. Clear? Aye.

646
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:50,840
Sure? Aye, I'm sure. OK.

647
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:07,120
OK, here you are.

648
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:14,120
OK, we're ready. ..OK.

649
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:15,680
'Quiet please! Running up.

650
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:24,400
'Joe, whenever you're ready.'

651
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:38,280

RAGGED BREATHING

653
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:19,760
Shit! Cut! What?Sorry, I nearly fell there.

654
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:23,680
Sorry, Joe. These things happen. I'm
afraid we really do need that shot.

655
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:25,760
Would you mind
just doing that again -

656
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:30,000
the walk down the stairsAye, OK.

657
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,800
Sorry, Joe. Thank you.

658
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:39,680
OK, guys, let's rehearse our moves
until we get it right.

659
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:41,120
Then we'll go again.

660
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:49,800
Can I get a drink of water, please?

661
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:51,280
..Oh, yeah.

662
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:02,600
Stay with him.

663
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:09,400
DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES

664
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:23,560
So, you're still looking after me,
are you?

665
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:30,120
I just want to say...
I hope it goes well.

666
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:33,960
But he seems a nice man. Who does?

667
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:35,600
Mr Little.

668
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,840
Have you met him? Yes.

669
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:43,240
Where? In Belfast.
I went to his home.

670
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:47,000
I didn't know that.Yes, I was delivering something.

671
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,520
To his home? Yes.

672
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:50,880
Did you go in? Yes.

673
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:53,400
Where was that? City centre...

674
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:55,240
um...

675
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:57,840
..beside the motorway.
A block of flats.

676
00:51:57,840 --> 00:52:00,280
It's a flat, then, is it?Yes, a flat.

677
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:04,040
So, he let you in, did he?I didn't stay long, I...

678
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:05,840
What was it like?

679
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:07,800
His flat? What was it like?

680
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:11,760
It was like...cold.

681
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:14,200
Empty. Empty?

682
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:16,560
Like not a home.

683
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:18,080
Not a happy place.

684
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:20,800
Was it?

685
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:22,560
I didn't like it.

686
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:24,960
Is he on his own, then?

687
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:27,280
Yes. Is he? But you liked him?

688
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:29,160
Yes.

689
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:31,000
What did you talk about?

690
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,040
About this.

691
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:35,200
This meeting. What did he say?

692
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:38,320
Well, he was worried about it.Oh, I bet he was!

693
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:40,720
He was worried for you.

694

DOOR OPENS

695
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:44,600
Joe, ready whenever you are. OK.

696
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:47,120
What do you...?

697
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:49,560
Will you let me finish my ciggie?

698
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:55,000
Aye, yeah, sure... Fine.

699
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:59,080
Worried for me? What do you mean,
he was worried for me?

700
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:02,120
That... He said he thought
it would be too painful for you.

701
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:04,680
He said that, did he?
Too painful, is that what he said?

702
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:07,440
Yes, difficult for you.
Painful or difficult? He said both.

703
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:11,080
Did he?

704
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:16,400
What about him?
What did he say about himself?

705
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:18,000
He didn't talk about himself.

706
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:21,560
But he seems very sad.

707
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:23,720
Sad?

708
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:29,240
I don't know, but...

709
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:32,280
I don't know him really,
but that's how he seemed.

710
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:37,640
Like he couldn't forgive himself
for what he's done to you.

711
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:40,040
There's an expression
you say, um...

712
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:43,160
..a broken man.

713
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:48,560
A broken man.

714
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:55,600
So, it's good...
It's good that you're meeting.

715
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:56,880
I think.

716
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:00,400

Aye.

722
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:17,520
I need an end to this.

723
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:24,560
Everything OK?

724
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:26,560
Joe?

Aye.

729
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:37,080
Joe, just a wee bit more here.

730
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:38,840
There you go.

731
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:42,600
Great.

MUFFLED SPEECH STOPS
I don't want the camera there.

741
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:25,840
I know, it takes some getting usedYou'll have to take it away.

742
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:28,560
Well, the thing about that...The thing is nothing!

743
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:30,600
Why don't we go
and talk this through?

744
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:34,640
I don't want the camera in my face
when I am meeting that man!

745
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:37,160
We did agree...I don't care what we agreed to.

746
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:39,520
I hear what you're saying,
but there must be a camera.

747
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:42,520
Would you like to speakStephanie?

748

out, go upstairs and...

INDISTINCT SPEECH

756
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:50,440
33 years that boy has been living
in this head, standing there,

757
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:56,240
staring at me, looking up at me,
never leaving me.

758
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:01,240
Never leaving.

759
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:04,320
Every morning waiting for me,

760
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:08,120
and I know
he'll be there for always.

761
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:18,760
I don't know what to do any more.

762
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:22,080
How to deal with this.

763
00:58:24,680 --> 00:58:27,360
I feel I've come to the end
of what I can take.

00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:42,200
What everyone says about everything.

766
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:43,840
The years just get heavier.

767
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:48,600
Why don't they tell you that?
Nobody tells you that.

768
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:02,960
FOOTSTEPS APPROACH

769
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:12,400
Can I get you anything?

770
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:15,200
Why do YOU think he didn't come in?

771
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:19,000
Too frightened?

772
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:22,760
You think
he really wanted to meet me?

773
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:26,240
I think he wanted to kill you.

774
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:37,440
MUFFLED VOICE OVER EARPIECE
..Sorry, I just have to go.

775
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:12,760
Guilty if I laugh.

776
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:15,000
Guilty if I drink.

777
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,920
Guilty if I forget.

779
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:26,640
What to do in it.

780
01:01:28,680 --> 01:01:31,080
I wake up, I go out.

781
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:33,600
But where to go?

782
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:39,520
He's always there.

783
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:42,400
In my head.

784
01:01:44,120 --> 01:01:45,880
And I don't know where to go.

785
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:51,720
Where to put yourself after it all.

786
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:56,120
It's the same for everyone.

A letter.

Are you taking the girls, Joe?

829

The girls? Marion's.

They're ready now.
They're waiting to go.

ALISTAIR GROANS SOFTLY

849
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:42,960
I'm going to Belfast
and I won't be coming back...

850
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:47,160
so I'm going to tell you
everything that happened here.

851
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:53,960
We were told that a Protestant
worker had been threatened...

852
01:14:53,960 --> 01:14:56,440
and if he didn't leave the yard,
he'd be shot.

853
01:14:56,440 --> 01:15:00,640
I asked who the Catholics were
working there.

854
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:02,960
Somebody said Jim Griffin.

855
01:15:02,960 --> 01:15:07,000
I said, "Tell him if he
doesn't leave, I'll shoot him."

856
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:12,320
I knew he was leaving anyway,
but it didn't make a difference.

857
01:15:15,320 --> 01:15:20,080
It was my decision. I was up
for anything, to kill anyone.

858
01:15:22,760 --> 01:15:26,080
I wanted...to be someone.

859
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:31,440
I wanted to...
walk into the bar a man.

860
01:15:31,440 --> 01:15:32,920
Walk in ten foot tall

861
01:15:32,920 --> 01:15:36,440
and hear the applause from the only
people that mattered to me then.

862
01:15:36,440 --> 01:15:38,760
And I heard it. And it was good.

863
01:15:42,240 --> 01:15:44,480
Get rid of me, Joe...

864
01:15:44,480 --> 01:15:46,600
so that when you wake up
in the morning,

865
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:49,120
it's not me's in your head,
it's your daughters.

866
01:15:50,120 --> 01:15:52,720
Don't give them me.

867
01:15:52,720 --> 01:15:55,600
Go home and tell them
that you've killed me off.

868
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:57,680
That I'm gone, forever.

869
01:15:57,680 --> 01:15:59,720
I'm nothing.

870
01:15:59,720 --> 01:16:01,240
Nothing.

871
01:16:03,080 --> 01:16:06,520
Go home and tell them that
and live your life for them.
