00:11:50,576 --> 00:11:51,770
Where?

155
00:11:54,313 --> 00:11:55,905
On 96th Street.

156
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:58,848
Let's go.
Wait!

157
00:11:58,918 --> 00:12:00,681
Let's go!
I can't!

158
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:04,617
Wait, wait. All right.
Can I please just
get my shit first?

159
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:08,917
Hey! That's my shit!

160
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:11,055
Hey! You motherfucker!

161
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:13,030
Come on, let's go! Let's go!

162
00:12:13,099 --> 00:12:14,225
Shit!

163
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:30,409
Wait right here.

164
00:12:36,388 --> 00:12:37,878
Where is another chopshop?

165
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,719
I don't know.
Can we get the
fuck out of here?

166
00:12:41,794 --> 00:12:44,661
Hold on! I gotta find
another car.

167
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:51,661
Wait right here.

168
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:07,715
Come hand me this wrench
over here in this red box.

169
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:12,052
What the fuck is...

170
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:17,387
Hey!

171
00:13:18,864 --> 00:13:19,956
Hey!

172
00:13:21,066 --> 00:13:23,057

173
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:24,997

My boy is coming over
here right now with
a car for you to look at.

179
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:36,541
And I got here before him.

180
00:13:36,615 --> 00:13:39,277
So since I got here
before him, I came inside
cause you wasn't here...

181
00:13:39,351 --> 00:13:41,581

you're trying to run on me...

182

where you found me.

You're coughing up blood.

I need to go back

You need to just let me
take you to your house.

203

Don't need to be
out here like this.

204

Five hundred.

209
00:15:43,575 --> 00:15:45,042
Just let me out of
the fucking car.

210

211

Where little man at?

showed up like I asked you to,

would have happened!

Nigga, they got Junior!

Who got Junior?
Some niggas carjacked me.

237

They took the fucking car
when Junior was
in the back seat.

You know, this house
don't really suit you.

256
00:19:01,406 --> 00:19:02,839
It was my grandmother's house.

257
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:05,102
Who you living with?

258
00:19:05,177 --> 00:19:06,974
P-Money and four other girls.

259
00:19:07,546 --> 00:19:10,606
We do all the fucking
hustling, and he makes
all the money.

260
00:19:10,682 --> 00:19:13,048
I'm just trying to
make enough money
so I can get out of it.

261
00:19:15,687 --> 00:19:16,949
What's your son's name?

262
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:23,526
Otis Junior.

263
00:19:23,595 --> 00:19:25,495
So you're Otis Senior?

264
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,432
Yeah, they call me O2.

265
00:19:29,801 --> 00:19:30,893
"O2?"

266
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:34,137
Back in the day when I
was on the block,

267
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:37,437
I used to go to
these different neighborhoods
and set it off.

268
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:41,411
Then I would disappear.
Just vanish.

269
00:19:42,214 --> 00:19:44,375
So they started
calling me "Oxygen."

270
00:19:44,449 --> 00:19:48,442
It got so crazy,
they just doubled it up,
started calling me O2.

271
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,454
So you were in the life?

272
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:52,422
Before I got locked up.

273
00:19:53,992 --> 00:19:56,222
So you couldn't vanish
when it counted most, huh?

274
00:19:57,496 --> 00:19:59,361
How long?

275
00:19:59,431 --> 00:20:00,659
I did six years.

276
00:20:01,733 --> 00:20:04,065
Only been out
on parole for a month.

277
00:20:04,136 --> 00:20:07,594
So, I suppose shooting
up people and having
a gun and all that shit

278
00:20:07,673 --> 00:20:09,971
is probably a violation
of your parole, huh?

279
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:11,907
I got the gun from work.

280
00:20:11,977 --> 00:20:13,467
You got the gun from work?

281
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:15,979
It's a part of
a program for ex-cons.

282
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:17,640
I'd have never took
the gun if the dude

283
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:20,184
who was supposed to be coming
to replace me
would have showed up.

284
00:20:20,252 --> 00:20:21,344
So you stole it?

285
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:22,717
I was going to
take the gun back.

286
00:20:22,788 --> 00:20:24,221
That sounds like bullshit

287
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:27,749
to me.

288
00:20:29,761 --> 00:20:31,456
That's why I can't
go to the police.

289
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:38,127
I got two strikes.
All it takes is one more.

it's a wrap.

The good news is
I found out who got Junior.

when he found out
Junior was your kid.

335
00:24:17,255 --> 00:24:20,247

I got out I ain't got
no more of that money.

He don't believe you.

337
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:25,960
He want the whole $100,000
in exchange for Junior
by Friday, midnight.

338
00:24:26,031 --> 00:24:29,125
How the fuck am I
supposed to come up
with $100,000 by tomorrow?

339
00:24:29,835 --> 00:24:31,132
I don't know, man.

340
00:24:31,203 --> 00:24:34,536
But if you don't
give it to him, he gonna
start chopping on Junior.

341
00:24:36,842 --> 00:24:37,831
O,

342
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:42,844
if you've got that money, man,
you gotta give it up.

343

doing security if I had
$100,000, bro?

344
00:24:49,454 --> 00:24:53,584
All I know is if
you ain't got that money,
then you better find it.

his money by tomorrow.

You get word to that nigga.

349
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:07,263
When he gets that money,
Junior better walk.

350
00:25:09,241 --> 00:25:11,004
Tell him to try me.

351
00:25:12,644 --> 00:25:14,635
So then,
what's your next move?

352
00:25:14,713 --> 00:25:16,738
I take Meat out
and go get my son.

353
00:25:16,815 --> 00:25:18,510
You can't even get near him.

354
00:25:18,583 --> 00:25:20,107
I can get near anybody.

355
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:24,747
No. Trust me. I used to
run for the Outlaws. I know
what I'm talking about.

356
00:25:25,457 --> 00:25:29,484
If you really want your son,
you need to get that money.

357
00:25:33,431 --> 00:25:34,830
All right. I got a plan.

get out of the life, right?

You're not hearing me.
You're not understanding
what I'm saying.

364
00:25:50,515 --> 00:25:52,949
Fucking with them is suicide.

Yeah.

00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:14,599
I don't have a problem
with P-Money.

370
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,501
Yeah, well, I do.

Meat's trying to

374
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:32,113
take over his territory,
and P ain't having it.

375
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:34,715
They're going head-to-head
right now. And you know what?

376
00:26:34,793 --> 00:26:36,988
Meat hit one of P-Money's
spots the other night.

377
00:26:37,862 --> 00:26:39,523
I know P's looking
to retaliate.

378
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:40,758
All right.

379

Yeah.

382
00:26:49,641 --> 00:26:53,737
If they find out what
I'm doing, my son is dead.

383
00:26:56,214 --> 00:26:57,511
So it's either all or nothing.

00:31:52,277 --> 00:31:53,403
How much you want?

462
00:31:53,478 --> 00:31:55,105
Just let me get a deuce.

463
00:31:55,179 --> 00:31:58,615
All right. But you gonna
have to wait till after I
finish this game.

464
00:31:58,683 --> 00:32:00,844
Yeah, well,
let me use your bathroom.

465
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:02,352
No, it's broke.

466
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:06,049
Use the one upstairs.
She can't go up there.

467
00:32:06,124 --> 00:32:09,491
Let the bitch use
the bathroom.
It's Mookie's cousin.

468
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:14,061
Go ahead.

469
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:17,564
Shit! See what you made me do?

470
00:32:17,869 --> 00:32:19,564
You distracted me,
motherfucker.

471
00:32:19,637 --> 00:32:22,606
Too bad. You've got
three more lives. Don't trip.

472
00:32:22,674 --> 00:32:24,665
This shit is real, I mean it.

473
00:32:58,309 --> 00:32:59,469
Who's all down there?

474
00:32:59,544 --> 00:33:02,240
It's about six of them.
Three little niggas
and three hood rats.

475
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:05,339
Do something then, homey.
You about to get sliced.

476
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:08,308
Fucking dagger in your back.
I'm supposed to get shot.

477
00:33:08,786 --> 00:33:12,244
No, homey, I got the knife
out right now, so I'm gonna
take that to your throat.

478
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:15,019
Nigga, don't bring a knife
to a gunfight, my...

479
00:33:15,093 --> 00:33:16,617
(GUN SHOT)
(ALL SCREAMING)

480
00:33:18,863 --> 00:33:20,524
Don't even try it!

481
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:26,402
Payback from Big Meat.

482
00:33:27,638 --> 00:33:31,472
Like, "She was fine.
Let her go upstairs.
That's Mookie's cousin."

483
00:33:31,642 --> 00:33:33,075
Now look at us, stupid.

484
00:33:33,144 --> 00:33:35,908
Can't wait till I tell
P-Money about this shit.

485
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:43,882
Oh, shit.

486
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:54,655
Look, look, look,
look, look, look.

487
00:34:03,474 --> 00:34:04,839
Oh, shit!

488
00:34:07,845 --> 00:34:10,109
We gotta get up out of here.
What the fuck is this?

489
00:34:10,181 --> 00:34:12,547
There's way too many
police around here.

490
00:34:33,104 --> 00:34:34,196
Damn.

491
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:36,536
This shit's like
a whole another world.

492
00:34:36,607 --> 00:34:39,667
Why? You ain't never been
to the Sunset Strip?

493
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:42,736
Nope. Never had
no reason to come.

494
00:34:47,852 --> 00:34:50,582
You wasn't at least
curious about this?

495
00:34:52,457 --> 00:34:54,823
I grew up in
the foster system.

496
00:34:54,892 --> 00:34:57,793
I used to dream
that someone from Hollywood

497
00:34:57,862 --> 00:35:00,353
would come one day
and they'd rescue me
and all that shit,

498
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:02,626
but no one ever came.

499
00:35:04,035 --> 00:35:07,436
Fuck it, then. By that time
I was, like, "I don't care.
I don't need Hollywood."

500
00:35:07,505 --> 00:35:09,837
Shit. I'm gonna find
something better
than this anyways.

501
00:35:09,907 --> 00:35:11,465
Yeah, right.
Yeah, okay.

502
00:35:11,542 --> 00:35:14,602
What, you wish you were
a world traveler 'cause you
done been to the pen and back?

503
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:57,713
Shit is crazy up here, man.

504
00:35:58,789 --> 00:36:02,190
Damn. Some nice houses.

505
00:36:02,393 --> 00:36:04,384
(CELLPHONE RINGING)

506
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:05,887
Yeah, what up, man?

507
00:36:05,963 --> 00:36:07,260
LUCKY: <i>About time you</i>
<i>answered your phone.</i>

508
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:09,299
Where you at?
<i>Busy.</i>

509
00:36:09,534 --> 00:36:10,728
You getting money?

510
00:36:10,801 --> 00:36:12,701
Yeah, something like that.

511
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:16,206
Shit. You better, man.
You gonna have it by tomorrow?

512
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:18,839
I don't know, man. We'll see.

513
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:21,504
I'm out here trying to
do what I can.

514
00:36:22,246 --> 00:36:24,612
And these streets
ain't no joke, dawg.

515
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:27,674
<i>Look here. Just give me</i>
<i>a holler if you</i>

516
00:36:27,752 --> 00:36:29,083
<i>I'm out here</i>
<i>doing my thing, so...</i>

517
00:36:29,153 --> 00:36:30,984
Hey, Lucky, let me
call you right back, boy.

518
00:36:33,491 --> 00:36:34,617
Did you see that?

519
00:36:36,093 --> 00:36:39,392
The limo?
Yeah, there's a lot
of rich folks up here...

520
00:36:39,463 --> 00:36:42,023
No, he looked like
he was leaving town.

521
00:36:42,099 --> 00:36:44,693
So?
So we need us
a spot we can lay low in.

522
00:36:44,769 --> 00:36:47,533
Can't keep driving around
with all this jewelry
and money in the car.

523
00:36:47,605 --> 00:36:49,266
Yeah, but how do you know
there's not still family

524
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:50,364
back up in that house?

525
00:36:50,441 --> 00:36:51,738
Because if somebody
was in the house,

526
00:36:51,809 --> 00:36:53,970
they'd have came out
to kiss him goodbye
or something.

527
00:37:27,178 --> 00:37:28,770
I think I can disarm it.

528
00:37:29,513 --> 00:37:31,105
How do you know?

529
00:37:31,182 --> 00:37:32,706
Because I used to do security.

530
00:37:33,384 --> 00:37:35,409
Was that before
or after you went to jail?

531
00:37:35,486 --> 00:37:36,817
After.

532
00:37:37,188 --> 00:37:38,883
And now you're breaking
into folks' homes.

533
00:37:40,491 --> 00:37:42,152
Man.
Shit.

534
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:47,220
Green. Got it.

535
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:49,725
Oh, shit.

536
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,062
What?

537
00:37:51,135 --> 00:37:53,000
I think I cut the wrong cable.

538
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:54,935
I'm gonna go start the car.
Wait, hold on!

539
00:37:59,477 --> 00:38:00,501
I got it.

540
00:38:02,246 --> 00:38:03,235
I got it.

541
00:38:04,649 --> 00:38:05,911
Come on.

542
00:38:26,003 --> 00:38:28,028
Hey. What are you doing?

543
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:29,638
Wait right here, okay?

544
00:38:38,015 --> 00:38:39,243
Come on.

545
00:38:44,188 --> 00:38:45,314
Damn!

546
00:38:48,125 --> 00:38:49,285
Goddamn.

547
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:52,454
Excuse the mess.
I let my maid go home.

548
00:38:57,568 --> 00:39:00,662
I could really get used to
some shit like this.

549
00:39:04,608 --> 00:39:06,542
Let's count this money.

550
00:39:19,423 --> 00:39:20,651
(DOORBELL RINGING)

551
00:39:25,463 --> 00:39:26,691
Shit.

552
00:39:26,764 --> 00:39:28,595
Damn. Must have
set off the alarm.

553
00:39:33,804 --> 00:39:35,499
O2: Where are you going?

554
00:39:35,573 --> 00:39:38,041
I got this.
Just watch this, wait.

555
00:39:45,916 --> 00:39:47,042
Go.

556
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:01,623
Hello.
Mrs. Bennett?

557
00:40:02,633 --> 00:40:05,363
No, I'm sorry.
There is no Mrs. Bennett.

558
00:40:06,871 --> 00:40:10,102
Oh, sorry.
I forgot about the alarm.
Bad habit.

559
00:40:10,174 --> 00:40:11,402
Do you know
the security code, ma'am?

560
00:40:11,475 --> 00:40:12,669
Yes, I do.

561
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:14,438
It's 9...
No, don't tell us.

562
00:40:14,512 --> 00:40:17,845
Could you activate
and then deactivate
the alarm for us, please?

563
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:19,041
Sure.

(BEEPING)

565

Having a little trouble,
sister?

566
00:40:32,129 --> 00:40:36,190
I'm so bad at these
electronic things. He's always
getting mad at me for it.

567
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:38,666
Mind if we step in
for a moment?

568
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:41,267
Ray, check the back.

569
00:40:44,208 --> 00:40:47,371
Mr. Bennett is in Paris
for a couple days.

570
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:52,212
Exactly what is
your relationship
with Mr. Bennett?

571
00:40:54,051 --> 00:40:55,746
I'm his assistant.

572
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:59,582
I'm gonna be housesitting
while he's gone.

573
00:41:03,661 --> 00:41:08,064
You know, it makes me feel
really safe that
the cops respond so quickly.

574
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:14,332
I'm gonna be here alone
for a couple days,
and I get kind of nervous.

575
00:41:16,273 --> 00:41:21,074
And so, if I see anything
that maybe seems

576
00:41:21,846 --> 00:41:24,280
suspicious
or anything like that,

577
00:41:24,782 --> 00:41:27,876
or if I just feel like
maybe I need some help,

578
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:32,680
would it be all right
if I called you?

579
00:41:34,758 --> 00:41:36,783
Can I call you personally?

580
00:41:40,464 --> 00:41:41,829
All clear.

581
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:44,733
I'll meet you outside
in a minute.

582
00:42:06,891 --> 00:42:08,153

583

Well, they gone.

Let's count it.

Thirty six thousand
four hundred, five hundred,

six hundred.

near enough for Junior.

a safe deposit box key, right?

00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:22,425
America's First Savings
and Loan?

598
00:43:23,067 --> 00:43:25,797
Right? What else could
that stand for?
What does that say?

599

B-O-T-P. Bank of the People.

00:53:48,325 --> 00:53:50,816
Be so glad when
this shit is over with.

766
00:53:50,894 --> 00:53:54,386
God willing, you'll have
Junior by tonight.

767
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,332
What you all gonna
do afterwards?

768
00:53:59,402 --> 00:54:02,132
I know I need to get
my son out of here.

769
00:54:02,606 --> 00:54:05,541
I'm done with this bullshit.
How about you?

770
00:54:07,277 --> 00:54:09,404
Don't really have any plans.

771
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:11,504
Just a fantasy.

772
00:54:12,148 --> 00:54:13,911
Yeah?
Yeah.

773
00:54:15,852 --> 00:54:17,786
When I used to live
in all those different homes

774
00:54:17,854 --> 00:54:21,915
I used to take travel
magazines and I'd cut
all the pictures out,

775
00:54:22,525 --> 00:54:25,221
and I would fantasize
that I was there.

776
00:54:25,829 --> 00:54:30,061
And everybody used to think
I was crazy, but I
didn't really care,

777
00:54:30,133 --> 00:54:32,363
'cause I felt like
I had been all over the world.

778
00:54:33,770 --> 00:54:37,262
Just 'cause I ain't been to
the Sunset Strip don't mean
I don't wanna travel.

779
00:54:42,345 --> 00:54:44,745
So when you get your money,
where you gonna go?

780
00:54:46,316 --> 00:54:48,614
There's this spot
I read about.

781
00:54:49,286 --> 00:54:51,516
It's on the coast of Mexico.

782
00:54:51,588 --> 00:54:53,021
It's called El Lindo.

783
00:54:54,090 --> 00:54:57,423
And they say
that there's magic
there in the ground.

784
00:54:58,228 --> 00:55:00,025
Everything you do is blessed.

785
00:55:00,797 --> 00:55:02,765
All your past is buried.

786
00:55:04,301 --> 00:55:06,599
And all your pain
is forgotten.

787
00:55:12,876 --> 00:55:14,173
That's where I wanna go.

788
00:55:28,625 --> 00:55:30,820
I want you to have something.

789
00:55:30,894 --> 00:55:31,986
What?

790
00:55:35,031 --> 00:55:37,431
We don't need to
let this one go.

791
00:55:38,301 --> 00:55:40,496
Take this with you to Mexico.

792
00:55:48,778 --> 00:55:50,541
How's it look on me?

793
00:55:51,548 --> 00:55:53,072
It's beautiful.

794
00:55:56,219 --> 00:55:57,413
Thanks.

795
00:56:02,125 --> 00:56:05,561
I just think of so many
more things I could be doing
to find my son.

796
00:56:05,628 --> 00:56:08,222
Listen to me. Listen to me.

797
00:56:08,531 --> 00:56:11,398
There is nothing else
you can do right now,

798
00:56:11,468 --> 00:56:13,902
except for wait
for Lucky to call.

799
00:56:14,337 --> 00:56:16,271
Junior's gonna be fine.

800
00:56:16,473 --> 00:56:17,963
Listen to me.

801
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:22,303
Junior's gonna be fine. Okay?

802
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:24,711
All right.

803
00:56:25,715 --> 00:56:26,841
Okay.

804
00:56:31,888 --> 00:56:34,550
I can't do this right now.
Come here.

O, don't do this to yourself.

816
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:58,703
You know all that money
that Big Meat is after?

817
00:58:04,981 --> 00:58:06,312
I took it.

818
00:58:08,618 --> 00:58:09,744
What?

819
00:58:14,190 --> 00:58:15,987
Me and Meat did a job.

820
00:58:17,026 --> 00:58:18,823
He tried to short me.

821
00:58:19,195 --> 00:58:20,662
So I took what was mine.

822
00:58:21,598 --> 00:58:24,761
He found out about it,
set me up.

823
00:58:25,201 --> 00:58:26,429
I went to the pen.

824
00:58:27,303 --> 00:58:30,136
He thought he knew
where I stashed my take,
but I moved it.

825
00:58:31,508 --> 00:58:34,773
He started looking for it.
He started getting closer.

826
00:58:34,844 --> 00:58:36,709
So I knew I had to
move it again.

827
00:58:37,580 --> 00:58:40,310
And the only person I
can trust was my baby mama.

828
00:58:42,585 --> 00:58:44,712
So she came down to see me.

829
00:58:45,388 --> 00:58:48,482
I told her where it was at,
where to move it to.

830
00:58:49,459 --> 00:58:52,895
She dropped Junior off
at my grandmother's house,
took my money.

831
00:58:52,962 --> 00:58:54,224
I ain't seen her since.

832
00:58:56,466 --> 00:58:59,526
You know the first thing
my son said to me
when I got out?

833
00:59:01,170 --> 00:59:03,434
"Promise me you ain't gonna
ever leave me again."

834
00:59:05,074 --> 00:59:06,405
I promised.

835
00:59:07,277 --> 00:59:09,745
Everybody you can
think of came at me.

836
00:59:09,812 --> 00:59:12,337
Money, credit cards. Just...

837
00:59:12,882 --> 00:59:14,679
Just couldn't do it.

845
00:59:47,850 --> 00:59:49,078
He died.

846
00:59:50,219 --> 00:59:51,777
How did he die?

847
00:59:54,390 --> 00:59:56,017
He was hit by a stray bullet.

848
00:59:59,062 --> 01:00:01,792
I was in a building, on a run.

849
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:06,327
I told him to play outside.

I heard this lady, she was...

856
01:00:28,691 --> 01:00:32,525
She was screaming,
"Where is his mother?
Where is his mother?"

01:00:36,332 --> 01:00:38,129

01:04:28,798 --> 01:04:31,460
boom, I kicked in
the motherfucking door.
I told motherfuckers,

"Get the fuck on the floor
right now, nigga.
It's a jack move!"
