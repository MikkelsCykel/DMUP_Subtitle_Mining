You see, l...

57
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,920
Well, l shall never be king.

58
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,040
And you...

59
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,360
shall never see
the light of another day.

60
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,960
Adieu.

61
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,480
Didn't your mother ever tell you

62
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,080
not to play with your food?

63
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,000
What do you want?

64
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,320
l'm here to announce that
King Mufasa's on his way,

65
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,840
so you'd better have a good excuse
for missing this morning's ceremony.

66
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,440
Oh, look, Zazu.

67
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,760
You've made me lose my lunch.

68
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,640
You'll lose more than that
when the king gets through with you.

69
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,280
He's as mad as a hippo with a hernia.

70
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,680
l quiver with fear!

71
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,200
Now, Scar, don't look at me that way.

72
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,160
Help!

73
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,760
- Scar?
- Mm-hmm?

74
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:21,880
Drop him.

75
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:25,040
lmpeccable timing, Your Majesty.

76
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:32,040
Why, if it isn't my big brother
descending from on high

77
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,080
to mingle with the commoners.

78
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,080
Sarabi and l didn't see you
at the presentation of Simba.

79
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,200
That was today?

80
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,360
l feel simply awful!

81
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,400
Must've slipped my mind.

82
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:48,600
Yes, well, as slippery
as your mind is,

83
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:51,240
as the king's brother,
you should've been first in line!

84
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:56,280
Well, l was first in line,
until the little hairball was born.

85
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:01,080
That hairball is my son
and your future king.

86
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,800
l shall practice my curtsy!

87
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,200
Don't turn your back on me, Scar.

88
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,720
Oh, no, Mufasa.

89
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,440
Perhaps you shouldn't
turn your back on me.

90
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,240
ls that a challenge?

91
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,880
Temper, temper.

92
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,000
l wouldn't dream of challenging you.

93
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,960
Pity. Why not?

94
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:23,240
Well, as far as brains go,
l got the lion's share.

95
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:26,520
But when it comes
to brute strength...

96
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:30,600
l'm afraid l'm at the shallow end
of the gene pool.

97
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,720
There's one in every family, sire.

98
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,280
Two in mine, actually -

99
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,360
and they always manage to
ruin special occasions.

100
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,360
What am l going to do with him?

101
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,120
He'd make a very
handsome throw rug.

102
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,240
Zazu!

103
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,640
And just think,
whenever he gets dirty,

104
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,720
you could take him out and beat him.

105
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,680
Hmm.

106
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,960
Simba.

107
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,240
Dad! Dad!

108
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,600
Come on, dad, we gotta go! Wake up!

109
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,640
Uhh!

110
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,320
Sorry.

111
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,200
Dad!

112
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,040
Your son is awake.

113
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:03,040
Before sunrise, he's your son.

114
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,160
Dad! Come on, dad.

115
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,880
You promised.

116
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,920
OK, OK. l'm up, l'm up.

117
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Yeah!

118
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,000
Look, Simba.

119
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,680
Everything the light
touches is our kingdom.

120
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,440
Wow.

121
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:42,240
A king's time as ruler
rises and falls like the sun.

122
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,120
One day, Simba,
the sun will set on my time here

123
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,160
and will rise with you
as the new king.

124
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,760
And this'll all be mine?

125
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,760
Everything.

126
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,960
Everything the light touches.

127
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,960
What about that shadowy place?

128
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,720
That's beyond our borders.

129
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,400
You must never go there, Simba.

130
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,360
But l thought a king
can do whatever he wants.

131
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:05,840
Oh, there's more to being king
than getting your way all the time.

132
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,000
- There's more?
- Simba...!

133
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:15,440
Everything you see exists together
in a delicate balance.

134
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:18,360
As king, you need to
understand that balance

135
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,080
and respect all the creatures,

136
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,160
from the crawling ant
to the leaping antelope.

137
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,080
But, dad, don't we eat the antelope?

138
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,600
Yes, Simba, but let me explain.

139
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,400
When we die, our bodies
become the grass,

140
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,880
and the antelope eat the grass.

141
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:38,320
And so we are all connected
in the great circle of life.

142
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,520
- Good morning, sire!
- Good morning, Zazu.

143
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,320
Checking in with the morning report.

144
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,560
Fire away.

145
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,800
# Chimps are going ape

146
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,480
# Giraffe remain above it all

147
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,840
# Elephants remember

148
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,360
# Though just what, l can't recall

149
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,680
# Crocodiles are snapping up

150
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,280
# Fresh offers from the banks

151
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,720
# Shown interest in my nest egg

152
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,560
# But l quickly said no thanks

153
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,040
# We haven't paid the hornbills

154
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,440
# And the vultures have a hunch

155
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,760
# Not everyone invited

156
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,480
# Will be coming back from lunch

157
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,960
# This is the morning report

158
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,400
# Gives you the long and the short

159
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,240
# lt's every grunt, roar and snort

160
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:16,200
# lt's not a tale l distort

161
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:20,360
# On the morning report

162
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,920
What are you doing, son?

163
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,880
Pouncing.

164
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,360
Let an old pro show you
how it's done.

165
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,280
# Oh, the buffalo have got a beef

166
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,840
Stay low to the ground.

167
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:33,360
Yeah, OK.
Stay low to the ground.

168
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,360
Shh! Not a sound.

169
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,200
# Saffron is this season's colour
Seen in all the herds

170
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,360
Take it slow.

171
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,960
One more step...

172
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,000
then...

173
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,920
# This is the morning report

174
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,440
# Gives you the long and the short

175
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:54,480
# Every grunt, roar and snort

176
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:58,000
# Not a tale l distort

177
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:01,800
# On the morning report

178
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,800
That's very good.

179
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,200
- Zazu!
- Yes!

180
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,800
- News from the underground.
- Now, this time...

181
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:16,960
Sire! Hyenas in the pride lands!

182
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,240
Zazu, take Simba home.

183
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,680
Aw, dad, can't l come?

184
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,480
No, son.

185
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,040
l never get to go anywhere.

186
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:27,680
Oh, young master,
one day, <i>you will be king.

187
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:31,840
Then you can chase those
slobbering, mangy, stupid poachers

188
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,880
from dawn until dusk.

189
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,960
Hey, Uncle Scar! Guess what?

190
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,000
l despise guessing games.

191
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,080
l'm gonna be King of Pride Rock.

192
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,080
Oh, goody!

193
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,080
My dad just showed me
the whole kingdom,

194
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,800
and l'm gonna rule it all!

195
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,440
Yes. Well, forgive me
for not leaping for joy.

196
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,720
Bad back, you know.

197
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,840
Hey, Uncle Scar.

198
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,040
When l'm king,
what'll that make you?

199
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,440
A monkey's uncle.

200
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:10,800
- You're so weird.
- You have no idea.

201
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,320
So, your father showed you
the whole kingdom, did he?

202
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,400
Everything.

203
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:18,480
He didn't show you what's beyond
that rise at the northern border?

204
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,920
Well, no. He said l can't go there.

205
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,920
And he's absolutely right.

206
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,240
lt's far too dangerous.

207
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,680
Only the bravest lions go there.

208
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,360
Well, l'm brave. What's out there?

209
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,520
l'm sorry, Simba,
l just can't tell you.

210
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,640
Why not?

211
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:38,160
l'm only looking out for the
well-being of my favourite nephew.

212
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,960
Yeah, right! l'm your <i>only nephew.

213
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,440
All the more reason
for me to be protective.

214
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:47,600
An elephant graveyard is no place
for a young prince. Oops!

215
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,040
An elephant what? Whoa!

216
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:53,080
Oh, dear, l've said too much.

217
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:56,000
Well, l suppose you'd have
found out sooner or later,

218
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,840
you being so clever and all.

219
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,560
Just do me one favour.

220
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:05,040
Promise me you'll never visit
that dreadful place.

221
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,480
No problem.

222
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,120
There's a good lad.

223
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,840
You run along now and have fun.

224
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,360
And remember,

225
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,840
it's our little secret.

226
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,600
- Hey, Nala.
- Hi, Simba.

227
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,840
Come on. l just heard
about this great place.

228
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,240
Simba! l'm kind of
in the middle of a bath.

229
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,280
And it's time for yours.

230
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,760
Mom!

231
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:36,240
Mom, you're messing up my mane!

232
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,040
OK, OK, l'm clean.
Can we go now?

233
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,360
So, where are we going?

234
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,960
lt better not be anyplace dumb.

235
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,720
No, it's really cool.

236
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,280
So, where is this really cool place?

237
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,480
Oh.

238
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,120
- Uh, around the water hole.
- The water hole?

239
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,080
What's so great about the water hole?

240
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,240
l'll show you when we get there.

241
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,480
Oh.

242
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,320
Uh, mom, can l go with Simba?

243
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,400
Hmm, what do you think, Sarabi?

244
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,560
Well...

245
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,000
Please?

246
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,160
lt's all right with me.

247
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,280
- Yeah!
- All right!

248
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,120
As long as Zazu goes with you.

249
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,120
No, not Zazu.

250
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,200
Step lively.

251
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:14,120
The sooner we get to the water hole,
the sooner we can leave.

252
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,000
So, where are we really going?

253
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,440
An elephant graveyard.

254
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,480
Wow!

255
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,160
Shh! Zazu.

256
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,840
Right. So, how are we
gonna ditch the dodo?

257
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,720
Oh, just look at you two.

258
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,800
Little seeds of romance
blossoming in the savanna.

259
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,000
Your parents will be thrilled,

260
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,320
what with your being
betrothed and all.

261
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,280
Be-what?

262
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,120
Betrothed. lntended.

263
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,000
Affianced.

264
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,120
Meaning...?

265
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,160
One day, you two are
going to be married.

266
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,120
- Yuck!
- Eww!

267
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,320
l can't marry her. She's my friend.

268
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,520
Yeah, it'd be so weird.

269
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,480
Sorry to bust your bubble,

270
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:52,080
but you two turtle doves
have no choice.

271
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,520
lt's a tradition
going back generations.

272
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,080
When l'm king,
that'll be the first thing to go.

273
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,880
- Not so long as l'm around.
- Well, in that case, you're fired.

274
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:02,280
Nice try,
but only the king can do that.

275
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,880
Well, he's the future king.

276
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:06,200
Yeah, so you have to
do what l tell you.

277
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,640
Not yet, l don't.

278
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,080
And with an attitude like that,

279
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:12,800
l'm afraid you're shaping up to be
a pretty pathetic king, indeed.

280
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,400
Not the way l see it.

281
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,640
# l'm gonna be a mighty king

282
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,480
# So enemies beware

283
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:22,080
# Well, l've never seen
a king of beasts

284
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,240
# With quite so little hair

285
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,680
# l'm gonna be the main event

286
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,920
# Like no king was before

287
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,360
# l'm brushin' up on lookin' down

288
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,800
# l'm workin' on my roar

289
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:37,360
# Thus far, a rather
uninspiring thing

290
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,800
# Oh, l just can't wait to be king

291
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:45,040
You've rather a long way to go,
young master, if you think...

292
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,520
- # No one sayin', ''do this''
- Now, when l said that...

293
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,920
- # No one saying, ''be there''
- What l meant was...

294
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,320
- # No one sayin', ''stop that''
- You don't realise...

295
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,880
- # No one sayin', ''see here''
- Now, see here!

296
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,600
# Free to run around all day

297
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,560
Well, that's definitely out.

298
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:03,480
# Free to do it all my way

299
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,600
# l think it's time that you and l

300
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,640
# Arranged a heart-to-heart

301
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,640
# Kings don't need advice

302
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,960
# From little hornbills for a start

303
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,480
# lf this is where
the monarchy is headed

304
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,800
# Count me out

305
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,280
# Out of service, out of Africa

306
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,760
# l wouldn't hang about

307
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:29,000
# This child is getting
wildly out of wing

308
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:33,360
# Oh, l just can't wait to be king

309
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,880
# Everybody, look left

310
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,840
# Everybody, look right

311
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,320
# Everywhere you look, l'm

312
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,960
# Standing in the spotlight

313
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,680
Not yet!

314
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:59,360
# Let every creature
go for broke and sing

315
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:03,160
# Let's hear it in the herd
and on the wing

316
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:08,640
# lt's gonna be
King Simba's finest fling

317
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:13,440
# Oh, l just can't wait to be king

318
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:18,160
# Oh, l just can't wait to be king

319
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,880
# Oh, l just can't wait

320
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:26,080
# To be king

321
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,640
l beg
your pardon, madam, but...

322
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,640
get off!

323
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,240
Simba?

324
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,080
Nala!

325
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,160
All right! lt worked!

326
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,600
- We lost him.
- l am a genius.

327
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,520
Hey, genius, it was my idea.

328
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,640
Yeah, but l pulled it off.

329
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,680
- With me!
- Oh, yeah?

330
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:58,640
- Pinned ya.
- Hey, let me up!

331
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,400
Pinned ya again.

332
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,960
This is it. We made it.

333
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,080
Whoa!

334
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,320
It's really creepy.

335
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,440
Yeah.

336
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,720
lsn't it great?

337
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,360
We could get in big trouble.

338
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,640
l know!

339
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,760
l wonder if its brains
are still in there.

340
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,680
There's only one way to know.

341
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,480
Come on, let's go check it out.

342
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:45,080
Wrong! The only checking out you
will do will be to check out of here.

343
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,360
Oh, man!

344
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,800
We're way beyond the boundary
of the pride lands.

345
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,400
Look, banana beak is scared.

346
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,200
lt's <i>Mr banana beak to you, fuzzy,

347
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:56,480
and right now we are all
in very real danger.

348
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,960
Danger? Ha!

349
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:00,040
l walk on the wild side.

350
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,280
l laugh in the face of danger.

351
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,000
Ha ha ha ha!

352
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,920
Well, well, well, Banzai,
what have we got here?

353
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,840
l don't know, Shenzi.

354
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,440
What do you think, Ed?

355
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,000
Just what l was thinking.

356
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,000
A trio of trespassers!

357
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,240
And quite by accident,
let me assure you.

358
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,080
A simple navigational error.

359
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,040
Whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait.

360
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:33,840
l know you.
You're Mufasa's little stooge.

361
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:36,160
l, madam, am
the king's major-domo.

362
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,840
And that would make you...

363
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,160
The future king.

364
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:42,600
Do you know what we do to kings
who step out of their kingdom?

365
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:45,400
Huh! You can't do anything to me.

366
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,640
Technically, they can.
We are on their land.

367
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:51,760
But you told me they're nothing but
slobbering, mangy, stupid poachers.

368
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,320
lx-nay on the upid-stay.

369
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,400
- Who are you callin' upid-stay?
- My, my, my. Oh, look at the sun!

370
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,480
- lt's time to go!
- What's the hurry?

371
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,400
We'd love you to
stick around for dinner.

372
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,760
Yeah, we could have
whatever's <i>lion around!

373
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,680
Wait, wait, wait,
l got one, l got one!

374
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,480
Make mine a cub sandwich!
Whaddaya think?

375
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,800
What, Ed? What is it?

376
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,600
Hey, did we order
this dinner to go?

377
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,720
No, why?

378
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,840
Cos there it goes!

379
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,440
- Did we lose 'em?
- l think so.

380
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,880
Where's Zazu?

381
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,000
The little major-domo bird
hippety-hopped

382
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,040
all the way to the birdie-boiler.

383
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,680
Oh, no! Not the birdie-boiler!

384
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:37,040
Aaaah!

385
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,360
Hey, why don't you pick
on somebody your own size?

386
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,600
- Like you?
- Oops.

387
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,760
Boo!

388
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,560
Simba!

389
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,640
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

390
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,720
Heh! That was it?

391
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,600
Do it again. Come on.

392
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:43,600
- Oh, please, please! Uncle, uncle!
- Silence!

393
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:46,560
- We're gonna shut up right now!
- Calm down. We're really sorry.

394
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,840
lf you ever come near my son again...

395
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,520
Oh, this is... this is <i>your son?

396
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,680
- Oh, <i>your son.
- Did you know that?

397
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,080
No. Me? l didn't know... No, did you?

398
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,960
- No, of course not.
- No.

399
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:00,560
Ed?

400
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,560
Toodles.

401
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:13,160
- Dad, l...
- You deliberately disobeyed me.

402
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:17,280
- Dad, l'm... l'm sorry.
- Let's go home.

403
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,280
l thought you were very brave.

404
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,800
Zazu.

405
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,240
Yes, sire?

406
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:47,440
Take Nala home.
l've got to teach my son a lesson.

407
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,320
Come, Nala.

408
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:56,680
Simba... good luck.

409
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,800
Simba!

410
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,400
Simba, l'm very disappointed in you.

411
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,800
- l know.
- You could've been killed.

412
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,760
You deliberately disobeyed me,

413
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:40,400
and what's worse,
you put Nala in danger.

414
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,960
l was just trying
to be brave, like you.

415
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:46,280
l'm only brave when l have to be.

416
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:49,880
Simba... being brave

417
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:52,200
doesn't mean you go
looking for trouble.

418
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,200
But you're not scared of anything.

419
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,440
l was today.

420
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,600
- You were?
- Yes.

421
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,720
l thought l might lose you.

422
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:04,640
Oh. l guess even kings
get scared, huh?

423
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,840
Mm-hmm.

424
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:08,080
- But you know what?
- What?

425
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,600
l think those hyenas
were even scareder.

426
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:15,160
Cos nobody messes with your dad.

427
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,560
- Come here, you.
- Oh, no! No!

428
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:20,120
Aagh! Uhh!

429
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,160
Come here!

430
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,560
Gotcha!

431
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,080
- Dad?
- Hmm?

432
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:33,800
- We're pals, right?
- Right.

433
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:36,520
And we'll always be together, right?

434
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:43,240
Simba, let me tell you something
that my father told me.

435
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,160
Look at the stars.

436
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:50,080
The great kings of the past
look down on us from those stars.

437
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,360
- Really?
- Yes.

438
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,680
So whenever you feel alone,

439
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:59,280
just remember that those kings
will always be there to guide you.

440
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,480
And so will l.

441
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,120
Man, that lousy Mufasa.
l won't be able to sit for a week.

442
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:19,040
lt's not funny, Ed.

443
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,880
Hey, shut up!

444
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,920
Will you knock it off?

445
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:31,200
- Well, he started it.
- Look at you guys.

446
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,640
No wonder we're dangling
at the bottom of the food chain.

447
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,120
Man, l hate dangling.

448
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,920
Yeah? lf it weren't for those lions,
we'd be runnin' the joint.

449
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,360
Man, l hate lions.

450
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,000
- So pushy.
- And hairy.

451
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,120
- And stinky.
- And, man, are they...

452
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,120
U-u-u-ugly!

453
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:51,080
Oh, surely we lions
are not all that bad.

454
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:53,880
- Oh.
- Oh, Scar. lt's just you.

455
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,960
We were afraid it was
somebody important.

456
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,400
Yeah, you know, like Mufasa.

457
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,000
- Yeah.
- l see.

458
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:01,200
- Now that's power!
- Tell me about it.

459
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,960
l just hear that name and l shudder.

460
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:05,520
- Mufasa!
- Ooh! Do it again.

461
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,920
- Mufasa!
- Ooooh!

462
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,480
Mufasa! Mufasa! Mufasa!

463
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:11,240
Ooh, it tingles me.

464
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:14,080
l'm surrounded by idiots.

465
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:17,160
Now, you, Scar, l mean, you're
one of us. l mean, you're our pal.

466
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,320
Charmed.

467
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:22,280
Oh, l like that. He's not king,
but he's still so proper.

468
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:24,120
Yeah. Hey, did you
bring us anything to eat,

469
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,360
Scar, old buddy, old pal?
Huh? Did ya, did ya, did ya?

470
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,680
l don't think
you really deserve this.

471
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:31,720
l practically gift-wrapped
those cubs for you,

472
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:35,080
and you couldn't even
dispose of them.

473
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:41,520
Well, you know... it wasn't exactly
like they was alone, Scar.

474
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,720
Yeah. What were we supposed to do?

475
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,520
Kill Mufasa?

476
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,040
Precisely.

477
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:02,920
# l know that your powers
of retention

478
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,600
# Are as wet
as a warthog's backside

479
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:10,680
# But thick as you are, pay attention

480
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:14,360
# My words are a matter of pride

481
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:17,960
# lt's clear from
your vacant expressions

482
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:21,800
# The lights are not all on upstairs

483
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:25,160
# But we're talking kings
and successions

484
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:27,880
# Even you can't be caught unawares

485
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,640
# So prepare for
the chance of a lifetime

486
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:36,920
# Be prepared for sensational news

487
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,680
# A shiny new era is tiptoeing nearer

488
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,280
And where do we feature?

489
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,480
# Just listen to teacher

490
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:46,360
# l know it sounds sordid

491
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,240
# But you'll be rewarded

492
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:51,720
# When at last l am given my dues

493
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:55,200
# And injustice deliciously squared

494
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:58,360
# Be prepared

495
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:02,200
Yeah, be prepared.
We'll be prepared. For what?

496
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,520
For the death of the king.

497
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,120
- Why, is he sick?
- No, fool, we're going to kill him.

498
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:09,200
- And Simba, too.
- Great idea. Who needs a king?

499
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:11,960
# No king, no king, la-la la-la la la

500
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:15,000
- ldiots! There will be a king!
- Hey, but you said...

501
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:17,000
<i>I will be king!

502
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,720
Stick with me,

503
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:22,520
and you'll never go hungry again.

504
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,840
- Yeah! All right!
- Long live the king!

505
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:28,200
Long live the king!
Long live the king!

506
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,120
# lt's great that
we'll soon be connected

507
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:37,320
# With a king who'll be
all-time adored

508
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:40,760
# Of course, quid pro quo,
you're expected

509
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:44,680
# To take certain duties on board

510
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:48,360
# The future is littered with prizes

511
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:52,640
# And though l'm the main addressee

512
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,920
# The point that l must emphasise is

513
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,800
# You won't get a sniff without me!

514
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:03,160
# So prepare for
the coup of the century

515
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:07,400
# Be prepared for the murkiest scam

516
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,080
# Meticulous planning

517
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,000
# Tenacity spanning

518
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:13,080
# Decades of denial

519
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:16,640
# ls simply why
l'll be king undisputed

520
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,600
# Respected, saluted

521
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:21,960
# And seen for the wonder l am

522
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:25,640
# Yes, my teeth
and ambitions are bared

523
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:28,800
# Be prepared

524
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:33,120
# Yes, our teeth
and ambitions are bared

525
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,960
# Be prepared

526
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:53,240
You wait here. Your father has
a marvellous surprise for you.

527
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:54,520
Ooh, what is it?

528
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:57,640
lf l told you, it wouldn't be
a surprise now, would it?

529
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,600
lf you tell me,
l'll still act surprised.

530
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:03,400
Ho ho ho! You are
such a naughty boy.

531
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:06,520
- Come on, Uncle Scar.
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

532
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,840
This is just for you
and your daddy.

533
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:13,400
You know, a sort of
father-son... thing.

534
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:16,160
Well, l'd better go get him.

535
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:19,320
- l'll go with you.
- No. Heh heh heh.

536
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:23,000
No. Just stay on this rock.

537
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:25,000
You wouldn't want to end up
in another mess

538
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,720
like you did with the hyenas.

539
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:30,520
- You know about that?
- Simba, everybody knows about that.

540
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:33,080
- Really?
- Oh, yes.

541
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:36,720
Lucky daddy was there
to save you, eh?

542
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,400
Oh, and just between us,

543
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:42,720
you might want to work on
that little roar of yours, hmm?

544
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:45,320
Oh, OK.

545
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:50,680
Hey, Uncle Scar,
will l like this surprise?

546
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:54,840
Simba, it's to die for.

547
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,640
Shut up.

548
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:20,000
l can't help it. l'm so hungry.
l got to have a wildebeest.

549
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,480
Stay put.

550
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,680
Can't l just pick off
one of the little sick ones?

551
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:27,560
No. We wait for the signal from Scar.

552
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:32,800
There he is. Let's go.

553
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,720
''Little roar.'' Puh!

554
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,560
Rarr!

555
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:43,080
Rrrarr!

556
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:48,160
Rarr!

557
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,840
Oh, look, sire,
the herd is on the move.

558
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:39,160
- Odd.
- Mufasa, quick.

559
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,920
Stampede in the gorge.

560
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,600
- Simba's down there!
- Simba?

561
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,280
Zazu, help me!

562
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:08,320
Your father is on the way! Hold on!

563
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,520
Hurry!

564
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:15,440
There! There on that tree!

565
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,680
Hold on, Simba!

566
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,560
Dad!

567
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,400
Oh, Scar, this is awful!

568
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:27,600
What'll we do? What'll we do?

569
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:30,040
l'll go back for help,
that's what l'll do.

570
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:05,480
Dad!

571
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,120
Scar!

572
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:32,520
- Brother.
- Brother... help me!

573
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:43,640
Long live the king.

574
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:51,480
No!

575
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:05,200
Dad!

576
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,800
Dad?

577
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,840
Dad?

578
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,920
Dad, come on.

579
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,760
You got to get up.

580
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,800
Dad?

581
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:05,680
We got to go home.

582
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:20,200
Help!

583
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,640
Somebody!

584
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,320
Anybody.

585
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:26,960
Help.

586
00:36:56,760 --> 00:37:00,320
Simba. What have you done?

587
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:04,560
There were wildebeests,
and he tried to save me.

588
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:07,760
lt was an accident.
l didn't mean for it to happen.

589
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:11,880
Of course. Of course you didn't.

590
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:16,680
No one ever means for
these things to happen.

591
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:19,000
But the king is dead.

592
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:23,360
And if it weren't for you,
he'd still be alive.

593
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:30,440
Oh, what will your mother think?

594
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:32,840
What am l going to do?

595
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:35,440
Run away, Simba.

596
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:40,440
Run. Run away and never return.

597
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,280
Kill him.

598
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,800
Whoa!

599
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:33,080
Yow!

600
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,680
Aah! Ohh! Yeow!

601
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,920
Hey, there he goes. There he goes.

602
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,840
So go get him.

603
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,400
There ain't no way
l'm going in there.

604
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:48,200
What, you want me to come out
looking like you, cactus butt?

605
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:50,520
But we got to finish the job.

606
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:53,520
Well, he's as good as
dead out there anyway.

607
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,760
And if he comes back, we'll kill him.

608
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,840
Yeah! You hear that?

609
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:01,480
lf you ever come back,
we'll kill you!

610
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:13,640
Mufasa's death is a terrible tragedy.

611
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:17,880
But to lose Simba,
who had barely begun to live...

612
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:23,560
For me, it is a deep, personal loss.

613
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:27,440
So it is with a heavy heart
that l assume the throne.

614
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:31,560
Yet out of the ashes of this tragedy
we shall rise

615
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:34,480
to greet the dawning of a new era

616
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:38,200
in which lion and hyena
come together

617
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:42,400
in a great and glorious future.

618
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,040
Yaaaah!

619
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:29,840
Get out! Get out! Get out of here!

620
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,160
l love this! Bowling for buzzards.

621
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,920
Hee hee hee! Gets 'em every time.

622
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:39,640
Uh-oh.
Hey, Timon, you better come look.

623
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:41,680
l think it's still alive.

624
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,040
Eeeuw.

625
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:46,160
All righty, what have we got here?

626
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:55,160
Jeez, it's a lion!
Run, Pumbaa, move it!

627
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:58,360
Hey, Timon, it's just a little lion.

628
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:02,840
Look at him.
He's so cute and all alone.

629
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:05,240
- Can we keep him?
- Pumbaa, are you nuts?

630
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:08,440
You're talking about a lion.
Lions eat guys like us.

631
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:10,880
- But he's so little.
- He's going to get bigger.

632
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:13,120
Maybe he'll be on our side.

633
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:16,000
That's the stupidest thing
l ever heard. Maybe he'll...

634
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:19,280
Hey, l've got it.
What if he's on our side?

635
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:22,520
You know, having a lion around
might not be such a bad idea.

636
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:23,640
So we're keeping him?

637
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:25,880
Of course.
Who's the brains of this outfit?

638
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,520
- Uh...
- My point exactly.

639
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:30,760
Jeez, l'm fried. Let's get out
of here and find some shade.

640
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:41,120
- You OK, kid?
- l guess so.

641
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,400
You nearly died.

642
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,040
l saved you.

643
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:46,200
Well, Pumbaa helped. A little.

644
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:48,040
Thanks for your help.

645
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:50,400
Hey, where you going?

646
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,600
Nowhere.

647
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:53,960
Gee, he looks blue.

648
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:58,080
- l'd say brownish gold.
- No, no, no. l mean he's depressed.

649
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,960
What's eating you?

650
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:04,000
Nothing. He's at the top
of the food chain.

651
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:07,520
The food chain!

652
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:11,000
Ahem.

653
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:12,840
So, where you from?

654
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:14,840
Who cares? l can't go back.

655
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:18,280
Ah, you're an outcast.
That's great. So are we.

656
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:20,600
- What'd you do, kid?
- Something terrible.

657
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:23,560
- But l don't want to talk about it.
- We don't want to hear about it.

658
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:25,720
Come on, Timon. Anything we can do?

659
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:28,320
Not unless you can change the past.

660
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:31,560
You know, kid, in times like this,
my buddy Timon here says

661
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:34,040
you got to put your
behind in your past.

662
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:35,640
No, no, no.

663
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:37,360
- l mean...
- Amateur.

664
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,520
Lie down before you hurt yourself.

665
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:42,200
lt's ''You got to put
your past behind you.''

666
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:45,920
Look, kid, bad things happen, and you
can't do anything about it, right?

667
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,200
- Right.
- Wrong!

668
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:49,800
When the world
turns its back on you,

669
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:52,480
you turn your back on the world.

670
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,360
Well, that's not what l was taught.

671
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:56,520
Then maybe you need a new lesson.

672
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:58,840
Repeat after me. Ahem.

673
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:00,800

686
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,600
Nothin'. What's-a-motto with you?

687

You know, kid, these two words
will solve all your problems.

688
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:44,640
That's right.
Take Pumbaa, for example. Why...

- # And, oh, the shame
- # He was ashamed

698
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:14,720
- # Thought of changing my name
- # Oh, what's in a name?

00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:26,560
l always thought
they were balls of gas

805
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:30,240
burning billions of miles away.

806
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:33,760
Pumbaa, with you, everything's gas.

807
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:35,760
Simba, what do you think?

808
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:37,760
Well, l don't know.

809
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:39,800
Oh, come on. Give, give, give, give.

810
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:42,760
Come on. We told you ours. Please?

811
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:44,200
Well...

812
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:46,800
Somebody once told me

813
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:51,240
that the great kings of the past
are up there watching over us.

814
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:52,160
Really?

815
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:55,440
You mean a bunch of royal dead guys
are watching us?

816
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:57,040
Pffff!

817
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:03,520
- Who told you something like that?
- Yeah, yeah.

818
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:08,160
- What mook made that up?
- Yeah. Pretty dumb, huh?

819
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:11,120
- Aw, you're killing me.
- Yeah.

820
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:23,160
Was it something l said?

821
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:50,120
Hmm.

822
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:12,800
Hmm.

823
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:14,960
Simba?

824
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:17,520
He's... he's alive? He's alive!

825
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:33,760

What are <i>you doing here?

Hey! What's goin' on here?!

859
00:53:57,400 --> 00:54:00,280
Timon, this is Nala.
She's my best friend.

860
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:04,120
- Friend?
- Yeah. Hey, Pumbaa, come over here.

861
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:05,320
Huh?

862
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:07,640
Nala, this is Pumbaa. Pumbaa, Nala.

863
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:10,280
- Pleased to make your acquaintance.
- The pleasure is all mine.

864
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:14,320
How do you d-... Whoa, whoa!
Time out! Let me get this straight.

865
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:16,240
You know her, she knows you.

866
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:20,760
But she wants to eat him,
and everybody's OK with this?

867
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:23,360
- Did l miss something?!
- Relax, Timon.

868
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:26,240
Wait till everyone finds out
you've been here all this time.

869
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:29,680
And your mother -
what will she think?

870
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:33,000
She doesn't have to know.
Nobody has to know.

871
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:35,240
Of course they do.
Everyone thinks you're dead.

872
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:36,440
They do?

873
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:39,600
Yeah. Scar told us
about the stampede.

874
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:43,040
He did? What else did he tell you?

875
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:48,240
What else matters? You're alive.
And that means... you're the king.

876
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:53,360
King? Lady, have you got
your lions crossed!

877
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:54,560
King?

878
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:58,640
Your Majesty, l gravel at your feet.
Mwah! Mwah! Mwah!

879
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:01,440
- Stop it.
- lt's not gravel, it's grovel.

880
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:04,920
And don't! He's not the king.
Are you?

881
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,480
- No.
- Simba!

882
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:08,960
No, l'm not the king.
Maybe l was gonna be,

883
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:11,240
but that was a long time ago.

884
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:14,920
Let me get this straight.
You're the king? And never told us?

885
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,640
- Look, l'm still the same guy.
- But with power.

886
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:20,480
Could you guys excuse us
for a few minutes?

887
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:22,360
Hey, whatever she has to say,

888
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:24,520
she can say in front of us,
right, Simba?

889
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:28,120
Mm... Maybe you'd better go.

890
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:32,320
lt starts. You think you know a guy.

891
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:36,880
Timon and Pumbaa -

892
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:38,880
you learn to love 'em.

893
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:42,480
What?

894
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:46,200
What is it?

895
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:48,480
lt's like you're back from the dead.

896
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:52,360
You don't know how much
this will mean to everyone.

897
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:54,240
What it means to me.

898
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:57,960
- Hey, it's OK.
- l've really missed you.

899
00:55:58,040 --> 00:56:00,560
l've missed you, too.

900
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:05,640
l tell you, Pumbaa.
This stinks.

901
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:07,360
Oh, sorry.

902
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:09,520
Not you! Them!

903
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:13,120
Him, her, alone.

904
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:14,600
What's wrong with that?

905
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:17,120
- # l can see what's happening
- What?

906
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:19,680
- # And they don't have a clue
- Who?

907
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:22,920
# They'll fall in love
and here's the bottom line

908
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,760
- # Our trio's down to two
- Oh.

909
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:28,760
# Ze sweet caress of twilight

924
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:31,400
# Why won't he be

925

lt is beautiful.

944
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:07,080
But l don't understand something.

945
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:09,440
You've been alive all this time.

946
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:11,760
Why didn't you
come back to Pride Rock?

947
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:16,320
Well, l just needed to get out
on my own, live my own life.

948
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:18,200
And l did, and it's great.

949
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:20,280
We've really needed you at home.

950
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:24,400
- No one needs me.
- Yes, we do. You're the king.

951
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:27,440
Nala, we've been through this.
l'm not the king. Scar is.

952
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:31,200
Simba, he let the hyenas
take over the pride lands.

953
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:33,200
- What?
- Everything's destroyed.

954
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:34,880
There's no food, no water.

955
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:37,520
Simba, if you don't do something
soon, everyone will starve.

956
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:38,840
- l can't go back.
- Why?

957
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:41,000
- You wouldn't understand.
- What?

958
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:43,640
No, no, no. lt doesn't matter.
<i>Hakuna matata.

959
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:45,360
- What?
<i>- Hakuna matata.

960
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:48,880
lt's something l learned out here.
Sometimes bad things happen...

961
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:49,840
Simba...

962
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:53,200
..and there's nothing you can do
about it. So why worry?

963
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:57,600
- Because it's your responsibility.
- Well, what about you? You left.

964
00:59:57,680 --> 01:00:00,440
l left to find help -
and l found you.

965
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:04,800
Don't you understand?
You're our only hope.

966
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:07,600
- Sorry.
- What's happened to you?

967
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:11,440
- You're not the Simba l remember.
- You're right. l'm not.

968
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:14,880
- Now are you satisfied?
- No. Just disappointed.

969
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:17,760
You know, you're starting
to sound like my father.

970
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:19,720
Good. At least one of us does.

971
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:23,920
You think you can just show
up and tell me how to live my life?

972
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,960
You don't even know
what l've been through.

973
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:27,600
l would if you'd just tell me.

974
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:29,440
- Forget it!
- Fine!

975
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:35,560
She's wrong. l can't go back.

976
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:39,200
What would it prove, anyway?
lt won't change anything.

977
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:41,520
You can't change the past.

978
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:47,480
You said you'd always
be there for me!

979
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:49,560
But you're not.

980
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:53,920
And it's because of me.

981
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,960
lt's my fault.

982
01:00:57,040 --> 01:00:59,400
lt's my fault.

983
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:04,720
# <i>Asante sana, squash banana

984
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:06,200
# <i>We we nugu, imi mi apana

985
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:07,920
# <i>Asante sana, squash banana

986
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:09,600
# <i>We we nugu, imi mi apana

987
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:11,640
# <i>Asante sana, squash banana

988
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:13,720
# <i>We we nugu, imi mi apana

989
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:40,640
# <i>Asante sana, squash banana
We we nugu, imi mi apana

990
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:43,760
Come on, will you cut it out?

991
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:46,640
Can't cut it out.
lt'll grow right back!

992
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:49,680
Creepy little monkey.
Will you stop following me?

993
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:53,240
- Who are you?
- The question is, who... are you?

994
01:01:55,560 --> 01:01:59,240
l thought l knew.
Now l'm not so sure.

995
01:01:59,320 --> 01:02:03,120
Well, l know who you are.
Shh. Come here. lt's a secret.

996
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:06,520
# <i>Asante sana, squash banana

997
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:08,840
Grrr! Enough!
What is that supposed to mean?

998
01:02:08,920 --> 01:02:12,080
lt means you are a baboon,
and l'm not.

999
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:15,960
l think you're a little confused.

1000
01:02:16,040 --> 01:02:18,800
Wrong!
l'm not the one who's confused.

1001
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:22,200
- You don't even know who you are.
- Oh, and l suppose <i>you know.

1002
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:25,120
Sure do. You're Mufasa's boy.

1003
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:29,120
- Bye.
- Hey, wait!

1004
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:38,840
You knew my father?

1005
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:41,960
Correction - l <i>know your father.

1006
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:45,840
l hate to tell you this,

1007
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:48,920
but he died... a long time ago.

1008
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:50,960
Nope. Wrong again!

1009
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:52,320
Ha ha ha!

1010
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:55,120
He's alive, and l'll show him to you.

1011
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:58,360
You follow old Rafiki.
He knows the way. Come on!

1012
01:03:07,240 --> 01:03:09,480
Don't dawdle. Hurry up!

1013
01:03:09,560 --> 01:03:12,680
- Hey, whoa, wait, wait.
- Come on. Come on!

1014
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:16,480
Would you slow down?

1015
01:03:27,560 --> 01:03:29,440
Stop!

1016
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:35,480
Look down there.

1017
01:03:59,160 --> 01:04:02,400
That's not my father.
That's just my reflection.

1018
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:04,880
No.

1019
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:07,680
Look harder.

1020
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:15,240
You see?

1021
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:18,800
He lives in you.

1022
01:04:22,760 --> 01:04:25,320
Simba.

1023
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:26,960
Father?

1024
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:37,200
Simba, you have forgotten me.

1025
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:39,320
No. How could l?

1026
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:43,960
You have forgotten who you are,
and so have forgotten me.

1027
01:04:44,040 --> 01:04:46,200
Look inside yourself, Simba.

1028
01:04:46,280 --> 01:04:50,200
You are more than
what you have become.

1029
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:53,480
You must take your place
in the circle of life.

1030
01:04:53,560 --> 01:04:57,320
How can l go back?
l'm not who l used to be.

1031
01:04:57,400 --> 01:05:01,080
Remember who you are.

1032
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:04,920
You are my son
and the one true king.

1033
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:10,240
Remember who you are.

1034
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:13,040
No! Please, don't leave me!

1035
01:05:13,120 --> 01:05:14,200
Remember.

1036
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:15,800
- Father!
- Remember!

1037
01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:17,760
Don't leave me.

1038
01:05:17,840 --> 01:05:19,680
Remember.

1039
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:29,880
What was that? Ha ha!

1040
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:31,600
The weather.

1041
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:35,200
- Very peculiar, don't you think?
- Yeah.

1042
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:37,200
Looks like the winds are changing.

1043
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:39,720
Ahh, change is good.

1044
01:05:39,800 --> 01:05:41,880
Yeah, but it's not easy.

1045
01:05:41,960 --> 01:05:46,760
l know what l have to do, but going
back means l'll have to face my past.

1046
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:49,760
l've been running from it
for so long.

1047
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:52,920
Ow! Jeez! What was that for?

1048
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,760
lt doesn't matter.
lt's in the past. Ha ha ha!

1049
01:05:55,840 --> 01:05:57,760
Yeah, but it still hurts.

1050
01:05:57,840 --> 01:06:00,040
Oh, yes, the past can hurt.

1051
01:06:00,120 --> 01:06:03,560
But the way l see it
you can either run from it

1052
01:06:03,640 --> 01:06:06,360
or... learn from it.

1053
01:06:06,440 --> 01:06:09,120
Ah! You see?
So what are you going to do?

1054
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:11,680
First, l'm gonna take your stick.

1055
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:13,920
No, no, no, no! Not the stick!

1056
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:17,440
- Hey! Where are you going?
- l'm going back!

1057
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:20,240
Good! Go on! Get out of here!

1058
01:06:22,800 --> 01:06:24,680
Whoo! Ha ha ha!

1059
01:06:24,760 --> 01:06:28,960
Whoooo! Whoooo!

1060
01:06:36,360 --> 01:06:37,480
Grubs! Grubs!

1061
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:44,840
Hey. Hey, wake up.

1062
01:06:48,680 --> 01:06:51,880
lt's OK! Whoa, whoa!
lt's OK! lt's me!

1063
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,360
Don't ever do that again.

1064
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:57,280
Carnivores! Oy!

1065
01:06:57,360 --> 01:06:59,840
- Have you guys seen Simba?
- l thought he was with you.

1066
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:02,200
He was, but now l can't find him.
Where is he?

1067
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:04,600
Ho ho! You won't find him here!

1068
01:07:04,680 --> 01:07:07,720
Ha ha! The king has returned.

1069
01:07:07,800 --> 01:07:10,840
l can't believe it. He's gone back!

1070
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:12,680
Gone back? What do you mean?

1071
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:15,560
Hey, what's goin' on here?

1072
01:07:15,640 --> 01:07:18,120
- Who's the monkey?
- Simba went back to challenge Scar.

1073
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:19,040
- Who?
- Scar.

1074
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:20,880
- Who's got a scar?
- No, it's his uncle.

1075
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:22,680
- The monkey's his uncle?
- No!

1076
01:07:22,760 --> 01:07:26,280
Simba's gone back to challenge
his uncle to take his place as king.

1077
01:07:26,360 --> 01:07:27,800
Oh.

1078
01:08:22,440 --> 01:08:24,240
Simba, wait up!

1079
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:31,720
- lt's awful, isn't it?
- l didn't want to believe you.

1080
01:08:31,800 --> 01:08:33,760
What made you come back?

1081
01:08:33,840 --> 01:08:36,640
l finally got some sense
knocked into me,

1082
01:08:36,720 --> 01:08:38,920
and l've got the bump to prove it.

1083
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,280
Besides, this is my kingdom.

1084
01:08:41,360 --> 01:08:44,560
lf l don't fight for it, who will?

1085
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:47,480
- l will.
- lt's gonna be dangerous.

1086
01:08:47,560 --> 01:08:51,840
Danger? Ha! l laugh
in the face of danger. Ha ha ha!

1087
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:53,640
l see nothing funny about this.

1088
01:08:53,720 --> 01:08:56,600
Timon! Pumbaa!
What are you doing here?

1089
01:08:56,680 --> 01:08:58,760
At your service, my liege.

1090
01:08:58,840 --> 01:09:02,320
Aww! We're gonna fight your uncle...
for this?

1091
01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:05,600
Yes, Timon. This is my home.

1092
01:09:05,680 --> 01:09:08,240
Oh. Talk about your fixer-upper!

1093
01:09:08,320 --> 01:09:12,600
Well, Simba, if it's important to
you, we're with you to the end.

1094
01:09:30,440 --> 01:09:34,360
Hyenas. l hate hyenas.

1095
01:09:34,440 --> 01:09:36,800
So what's your plan
for getting past those guys?

1096
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:40,120
- Live bait.
- Good idea. Hey!

1097
01:09:40,200 --> 01:09:42,880
Come on, Timon. You guys
have to create a diversion.

1098
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:45,480
What do you want me to do,
dress in drag and do the hula?

1099
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:47,520
Luau!

1100
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:49,240
# lf you're hungry for a hunk
of fat and juicy meat

1101
01:09:49,320 --> 01:09:51,000
# Eat my buddy Pumbaa here
because he is a treat

1102
01:09:51,080 --> 01:09:52,960
# Come on down and dine
on this tasty swine

1103
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:54,960
# All you have to do is get in line

1104
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:56,800
- # Are you achin'
- Yep, yep, yep.

1105
01:09:56,880 --> 01:09:58,880
- # For some bacon?
- Yep, yep, yep.

1106
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:00,400
- # He's a big pig
- Yep, yep.

1107
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:02,280
# You could be a big pig, too! Oi!

1108
01:10:07,160 --> 01:10:10,360
Nala, you find my mother
and rally the lionesses.

1109
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:13,440
l'll look for Scar.

1110
01:10:15,560 --> 01:10:17,200
Sarabi!

1111
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:32,440
Yes, Scar?

1112
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:35,840
Where is your hunting party?
They're not doing their job.

1113
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:38,680
Scar, there is no food.
The herds have moved on.

1114
01:10:38,760 --> 01:10:41,320
No, you're just not
looking hard enough.

1115
01:10:41,400 --> 01:10:45,240
lt's over. There is nothing left.

1116
01:10:45,320 --> 01:10:49,040
We have only one choice.
We must leave Pride Rock.

1117
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:52,440
- We're not going anywhere.
- You have sentenced us to death.

1118
01:10:52,520 --> 01:10:54,560
- Then so be it.
- You can't do that.

1119
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:56,840
l am the king.
l can do whatever l want.

1120
01:10:56,920 --> 01:10:59,240
lf you were half
the king Mufasa was...

1121
01:10:59,320 --> 01:11:01,800
l'm ten times the king Mufasa was!

1122
01:11:04,680 --> 01:11:07,000
Mufasa? No, you're dead.

1123
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:15,680
Mufasa?

1124
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:18,880
No. lt's me.

1125
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:24,320
Simba! You're alive?
How can that be?

1126
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:28,040
lt doesn't matter. l'm home.

1127
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:29,400
Simba?

1128
01:11:29,480 --> 01:11:33,880
Simba! Oh, l'm a little
surprised to see you...

1129
01:11:33,960 --> 01:11:35,360
alive.

1130
01:11:36,920 --> 01:11:40,320
Give me one good reason
why l shouldn't rip you apart.

1131
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:42,280
Oh, Simba, you must understand.

1132
01:11:42,360 --> 01:11:44,640
The pressures of ruling a kingdom...

1133
01:11:44,720 --> 01:11:47,880
Are no longer yours. Step down, Scar.

1134
01:11:47,960 --> 01:11:50,280
Oh, well, l would, naturally.

1135
01:11:50,360 --> 01:11:53,160
However, there is one little problem.

1136
01:11:53,240 --> 01:11:55,040
You see them?

1137
01:11:56,600 --> 01:11:58,800
They think <i>I'm king.

1138
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:02,480
Well, we don't.
Simba's the rightful king.

1139
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:04,400
The choice is yours, Scar.

1140
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:06,760
Either step down or fight.

1141
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:09,280
Oh, must this all end in violence?

1142
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:13,480
l'd hate to be responsible
for the death of a family member.

1143
01:12:13,560 --> 01:12:16,680
- Wouldn't you agree, Simba?
- That's not gonna work, Scar.

1144
01:12:16,760 --> 01:12:18,080
l've put it behind me.

1145
01:12:18,160 --> 01:12:20,000
But what about
your faithful subjects?

1146
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:21,880
Have they put it behind them?

1147
01:12:21,960 --> 01:12:23,960
Simba, what is he talking about?

1148
01:12:24,040 --> 01:12:28,200
Ah... so you haven't told them
your little secret.

1149
01:12:28,280 --> 01:12:31,520
Well, Simba,
now's your chance to tell them.

1150
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:35,600
Tell them who is responsible
for Mufasa's death.

1151
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:40,560
l am.

1152
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:46,280
lt's not true.

1153
01:12:46,360 --> 01:12:48,800
Tell me it's not true.

1154
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:53,440
- lt's true.
- You see? He admits it!

1155
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:56,400
- Murderer!
- No! lt was an accident.

1156
01:12:56,480 --> 01:13:00,040
lf it weren't for you, Mufasa would
be alive. lt's your fault he's dead!

1157
01:13:00,120 --> 01:13:01,560
- Do you deny it?
- No.

1158
01:13:01,640 --> 01:13:05,760
- Then you're guilty.
- No, l'm not a murderer!

1159
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:07,880
Oh, Simba, you're in trouble again,

1160
01:13:07,960 --> 01:13:10,840
but this time
daddy isn't here to save you,

1161
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:14,000
and now everyone knows why!

1162
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:16,280
Simba!

1163
01:13:21,640 --> 01:13:24,360
Now, this looks familiar.

1164
01:13:24,440 --> 01:13:29,200
Hmm. Where have l seen this before?
Let me think. Hmm.

1165
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,520
Oh, yes. l remember.

1166
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:36,280
This is just the way
your father looked before he died.

1167
01:13:38,360 --> 01:13:41,960
And here's <i>my little secret.

1168
01:13:42,040 --> 01:13:45,000
l killed Mufasa.

1169
01:13:47,720 --> 01:13:49,800
No! Murderer!

1170
01:13:50,520 --> 01:13:52,880
- No, Simba, please.
- Tell them the truth.

1171
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:56,520
Truth? But truth is in
the eye of the behold-...

1172
01:13:56,600 --> 01:13:57,960
All right.

1173
01:13:58,040 --> 01:14:01,080
All right.

1174
01:14:01,160 --> 01:14:02,600
l did it.

1175
01:14:02,680 --> 01:14:04,680
So they can hear you.

1176
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:08,480
l killed Mufasa!

1177
01:14:17,880 --> 01:14:20,200
Hee-yah!

1178
01:14:20,280 --> 01:14:23,080
Excuse me. Pardon me.
Comin' through. Hot stuff. Whoo!

1179
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:50,160
Aagghh!

1180
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:53,760
- Let me out! Let me out!
- Let me in! Let me in!

1181
01:14:55,120 --> 01:14:57,400
Please, don't eat me.

1182
01:14:57,480 --> 01:14:58,920
Drop 'em!

1183
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,240
- Hey, who's the pig?
- Are you talkin' to me?

1184
01:15:01,320 --> 01:15:03,280
- Uh-oh. He called him a pig.
- To me?

1185
01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:05,080
- Shouldn't have done that.
- To me?!

1186
01:15:05,160 --> 01:15:10,640
- Now they're in for it.
- They call me... <i>Mr Pig!

1187
01:15:10,720 --> 01:15:13,680
Aaaaggghhh!

1188
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:16,320
Take that, you stupid...

1189
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:18,320
Take that and that!

1190
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:23,720
Run, you yellow-belly!

1191
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:25,240
Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!

1192
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,720
- Murderer.
- Simba. Simba, please.

1193
01:15:45,800 --> 01:15:49,520
- Please, have mercy. l beg you.
- You don't deserve to live.

1194
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:52,600
But Simba, l am...

1195
01:15:52,680 --> 01:15:54,800
uh... family.

1196
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:58,000
lt's the hyenas
who are the real enemy.

1197
01:15:58,080 --> 01:16:00,680
lt was their fault.
lt was their idea.

1198
01:16:00,760 --> 01:16:02,800
Why should l believe you?

1199
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:05,840
Everything you ever told me
was a lie.

1200
01:16:05,920 --> 01:16:07,760
What are you going to do?

1201
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:11,280
You wouldn't kill your own uncle.

1202
01:16:11,360 --> 01:16:13,680
No, Scar.

1203
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:15,560
l'm not like you.

1204
01:16:15,640 --> 01:16:18,720
Oh, Simba, thank you.
You are truly noble.

1205
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:22,440
l'll make it up to you, l promise.
And how can l prove myself to you?

1206
01:16:22,520 --> 01:16:24,080
Tell me. l mean, anything.

1207
01:16:24,160 --> 01:16:25,680
Run.

1208
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:28,160
Run away, Scar,

1209
01:16:28,240 --> 01:16:30,320
and never return.

1210
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:33,160
Er... yes.

1211
01:16:33,240 --> 01:16:35,320
Of course.

1212
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:37,960

Ah, my friends!

1215
01:17:34,360 --> 01:17:37,840
Friends? l thought he said
we were the enemy.

1216
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:40,880
Yeah. That's what l heard.

1217
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:42,240
Ed?

1218
01:17:46,160 --> 01:17:50,520
No. L-l-let me explain.
No, you don't understand!

1219
01:17:50,600 --> 01:17:52,920
No, l didn't mean... No! No!
