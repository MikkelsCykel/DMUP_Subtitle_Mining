00:02:08,296 --> 00:02:10,389
No. No no!

2
00:02:14,435 --> 00:02:16,562
No, Trevor!

3
00:02:23,044 --> 00:02:25,035
Trevor, baby, no.

4
00:02:42,197 --> 00:02:44,188
Hello?

5
00:02:48,102 --> 00:02:50,093
Is someone there?

6
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:54,031
Is someone in there?

7
00:02:56,544 --> 00:02:58,774
Is there someone
alive in there?

8
00:03:16,698 --> 00:03:18,757
Hey.

9
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,789
Are you okay?

10
00:03:20,835 --> 00:03:23,030
Are you okay?

11
00:03:24,172 --> 00:03:26,197
I'm gonna get you
out of there.

12
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:30,368
Hold on!

13
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:32,437
What does it mean
to be happy?

14
00:04:34,842 --> 00:04:38,141
To be content
in the world around you?

15
00:04:42,016 --> 00:04:44,507
Mom used to say
it was family--

16
00:04:47,388 --> 00:04:51,154
That family is the heart
of everything, even existence.

17
00:04:51,192 --> 00:04:54,457
Without it, there's nothing.

18
00:04:58,366 --> 00:05:00,630
She would always have
these simple answers

19
00:05:00,668 --> 00:05:03,364
that somehow would sound
so brilliant.

20
00:05:07,442 --> 00:05:09,808
And then she died.

21
00:05:10,812 --> 00:05:13,781
My father died
along with her.

22
00:05:14,782 --> 00:05:17,876
Shortly after that, my brother David
had to sell the farm

23
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:20,319
where we grew up.

24
00:05:22,457 --> 00:05:25,187
Now we're just trying to be
an ordinary family,

25
00:05:25,226 --> 00:05:29,287
trying to figure out
where we fit in in the world.

26
00:05:33,334 --> 00:05:35,325
And for me,

27
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:37,770
I'm trying to figure out
where I belong,

28
00:05:37,805 --> 00:05:41,104
right now
in this exact moment.

29
00:05:41,709 --> 00:05:44,041
I don't know, Dad.
What do you think about the black hair?

30
00:05:47,815 --> 00:05:49,612
Come on, it's different.

31
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:51,982
- It's different than normal.
- It's pretty, don't you think?

32
00:05:54,489 --> 00:05:56,889
Oh, yes.
Yes yes, definitely--

33
00:05:56,924 --> 00:05:58,721
right there, right there.

34
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,853
Look at the baby,
he's part of the family.

35
00:06:00,895 --> 00:06:03,227
- Hey, there we go.
- Okay, Dad.

36
00:06:24,152 --> 00:06:25,983
I don't wanna hear that,
Darlene.

37
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,885
The social worker
will be here tomorrow.

38
00:06:27,922 --> 00:06:29,822
We can't have the place
looking like this.

39
00:06:29,857 --> 00:06:33,554
- Whatever you say, Dad.
- That's not funny, Darlene.

40
00:06:33,594 --> 00:06:36,324
Okay, I'm trying to do
the best I can here.

41
00:06:36,364 --> 00:06:38,764
Oh, Jesus. You know, I'm not
a little girl anymore

42
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,768
and you don't have to be
a dick about this!

43
00:06:40,802 --> 00:06:43,168
Just-- can you just please
clean your room

44
00:06:43,204 --> 00:06:45,934
and maybe not wear that mess
on your eyes tomorrow?

45
00:06:45,973 --> 00:06:47,964
Fuck you, David!

46
00:06:54,515 --> 00:06:57,245
Francis, turn it off now!

47
00:06:57,285 --> 00:06:59,913
Oh, come on, David,
it's a school project.

48
00:06:59,954 --> 00:07:02,115
- Just not our personal stuff, okay?
- It's about our family.

49
00:07:02,156 --> 00:07:04,852
- I need this kind of stuff.
- Turn it off now!

50
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:11,223
You just get the heck
out of my face for a second.

51
00:07:15,069 --> 00:07:17,629
My brother David
is the oldest.

52
00:07:17,672 --> 00:07:21,665
He picked up all the responsibilities
after Mom and Dad died.

53
00:07:22,944 --> 00:07:25,105
We used to be real close,

54
00:07:26,647 --> 00:07:30,344
but after he sold our farm
something changed in him.

55
00:07:30,384 --> 00:07:34,343
He became like one of those life-sized
cardboard cutouts you see in the stores,

56
00:07:34,388 --> 00:07:38,791
trying to sell the idea
that everything is perfect,

57
00:07:40,061 --> 00:07:43,030
but really nothing
is the same anymore.

58
00:07:43,064 --> 00:07:45,259
We just keep moving
from town to town

59
00:07:45,299 --> 00:07:47,199
running from the truth,

60
00:07:47,235 --> 00:07:50,295
waiting for it to one day
catch up with us.

61
00:07:51,372 --> 00:07:54,364
This is our sixth house
in two years.

62
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:25,063
Oh, yeah,
every single one of them.

63
00:08:26,107 --> 00:08:29,270
Wow, that's cool.

64
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:31,369
Okay, guys,
I'm gonna go pee.

65
00:08:31,412 --> 00:08:33,744
- No, wait.
- I gotta go. No, come on.

66
00:08:33,781 --> 00:08:36,341
- Sam, stay.
- I'm gonna go. I'll be right back.

67
00:08:36,384 --> 00:08:40,115
- Don't take too long.
- I won't.

68
00:09:24,699 --> 00:09:28,863
Sam, get your ass in here
and smoke a joint.

69
00:09:28,903 --> 00:09:32,839
It's beautiful. Come on,
do the rain dance.

70
00:09:32,873 --> 00:09:35,341
Hell, no! Get in the car
right now, girl.

71
00:09:35,376 --> 00:09:37,844
Come on. No!

72
00:09:38,913 --> 00:09:42,474
- Yeah! Ow! Get in here.
- Come on!

73
00:09:42,516 --> 00:09:44,882
Back in.

74
00:09:46,721 --> 00:09:50,657
So, did you guys have fun?

75
00:09:50,691 --> 00:09:52,659
- Yeah.
- You are glowing.

76
00:09:52,693 --> 00:09:54,854
No, I'm not.

77
00:09:57,064 --> 00:10:00,898
So, Wendell,
what do you do?

78
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:05,264
I work for my brother--

79
00:10:06,507 --> 00:10:09,135
fetch stuff for him,
things like that.

80
00:10:09,176 --> 00:10:13,613
- Nothing too exciting though.
- Sounds cool.

81
00:10:14,815 --> 00:10:18,114
So where are you guys off
to next, huh?

82
00:10:18,152 --> 00:10:20,620
Seattle, I think.

83
00:10:20,655 --> 00:10:23,283
We're just gonna keep traveling
city to city

84
00:10:23,324 --> 00:10:26,293
till we run all out of money.

85
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:30,457
- Can't beat that kind of freedom.
- No, we just picked up and left!

86
00:10:30,498 --> 00:10:31,863
No one even knows
where we're at.

87
00:10:31,899 --> 00:10:34,129
- What?
- Hush.

88
00:10:34,168 --> 00:10:36,568
We don't have to worry
about Wendell, our hero.

89
00:10:36,604 --> 00:10:39,732
Wendell is Superman.

90
00:10:43,344 --> 00:10:46,643
Wow, look at that.

91
00:10:46,681 --> 00:10:48,979
Look at all
those pretty stars.

92
00:10:49,016 --> 00:10:52,679
- Where?
- I think you mean raindrops.

93
00:11:24,285 --> 00:11:26,913
You can at least pretend
to like it, okay?

94
00:11:30,257 --> 00:11:34,284
Hey, I'm sorry for yelling
at you yesterday.

95
00:11:34,328 --> 00:11:37,092
I didn't mean to.

96
00:11:37,131 --> 00:11:39,326
We're good?

97
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:43,598
Yeah, we're good. But, David,
I'm really not feeling too hot today.

98
00:11:43,637 --> 00:11:46,299
- You're going to school, okay?
- I just don't think--

99
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:48,240
I don't wanna hear it.
You're going to school.

100
00:11:48,275 --> 00:11:51,802
Good morning, sleepyhead.
You want some breakfast?

101
00:11:51,846 --> 00:11:54,474
Why do you even bother?

102
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:59,511
Because that's what families do.
They have breakfast together.

103
00:11:59,553 --> 00:12:03,250
Cute, David. Anyway, Kitty's
spending the night tomorrow.

104
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:05,622
- Who's uh--
- I am telling you in advance,

105
00:12:05,659 --> 00:12:08,457
- just like you asked.
- Who the heck is Kitty?

106
00:12:08,496 --> 00:12:11,192
I don't know,
some chick from Ohio.

107
00:12:11,232 --> 00:12:15,328
All right. Remember, social worker
is coming tonight at 5:00 for dinner.

108
00:12:18,973 --> 00:12:22,067
You should really try
giving up cooking, David.

109
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:28,273
I'm off,
and you go to school.

110
00:12:28,315 --> 00:12:30,112
I really don't fit in there.

111
00:12:30,151 --> 00:12:32,142
Look,

112
00:12:34,321 --> 00:12:36,585
I know it's hard for you,

113
00:12:36,624 --> 00:12:38,751
but can you please
at least try?

114
00:12:38,793 --> 00:12:42,285
Why? It's not my fault
we're always moving.

115
00:12:42,329 --> 00:12:45,662
You're right, Francis.
It's my fault.

116
00:12:45,699 --> 00:12:48,429
I'm sorry, guys.

117
00:12:48,469 --> 00:12:52,064
I know I have a bad temper.
What do you want me to do?

118
00:12:53,307 --> 00:12:56,401
Some maybe say I'm bipolar.

119
00:12:56,443 --> 00:13:00,072
Good morning, Francis.
How are you doing there, bud, huh?

120
00:13:00,114 --> 00:13:02,105
What are you reading?

121
00:13:02,149 --> 00:13:05,812
"Gay sperm donors needed
for lesbian couple."

122
00:13:05,853 --> 00:13:08,822
- Knock it off.
- You're calling that today.

123
00:13:14,195 --> 00:13:17,130
- Have you fed Lenny?
- Don't look at me. Look at Franny.

124
00:13:17,164 --> 00:13:19,826
Oh, come on, I just did it
two days ago.

125
00:13:19,867 --> 00:13:21,994
Okay, I gotta go to work.

126
00:13:22,036 --> 00:13:26,302
- Will you just please do it?
- I'll do it before I go to school.

127
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:33,778
Where're you going? Oh, yeah, you gotta
go do your thing. Forgot, sorry.

128
00:13:33,814 --> 00:13:36,510
Have fun.
Have a good day.

129
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:44,248
The twins-- they've always
been distant from the family.

130
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:47,590
Wendell is the main reason
why we move a lot.

131
00:13:47,628 --> 00:13:49,926
He just got out of jail for biting
some guy's ear off

132
00:13:49,964 --> 00:13:53,297
at a Cheesy Chuck's Pizza parlor
up north.

133
00:13:53,334 --> 00:13:56,826
Darlene is just as mean,
but more refined.

134
00:13:56,871 --> 00:13:59,863
Like when we were kids,
she used to lock me in the closet

135
00:13:59,907 --> 00:14:02,432
just to hear me scream.
Then, hours later,

136
00:14:02,476 --> 00:14:06,276
she would let me out pretending
she was the one who saved me.

137
00:14:06,313 --> 00:14:09,077
And I always fell for it.

138
00:14:58,165 --> 00:15:00,793
Let me out of here!

139
00:15:00,834 --> 00:15:03,928
Help, please!

140
00:15:33,667 --> 00:15:35,658
Please.

141
00:15:37,938 --> 00:15:42,170
Somebody please help us!

142
00:15:51,819 --> 00:15:55,585
Oh, heck no, we've had a lot
of social workers come here,

143
00:15:55,622 --> 00:15:57,886
but you're the first
for dinner.

144
00:15:57,925 --> 00:16:01,554
So, Francis, what's up
with you tonight, huh?

145
00:16:02,563 --> 00:16:05,123
- Nothing.
- Anything you wanna talk about?

146
00:16:05,165 --> 00:16:08,157
Anything at all? School maybe?
I don't know...

147
00:16:10,037 --> 00:16:13,734
Well, you know, if there is,
you just jump on in, all right?

148
00:16:13,774 --> 00:16:16,675
Yeah, he told me he wasn't
feeling too well this morning.

149
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:18,837
Oh, I'm sorry.

150
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:21,746
Oh, thank you, Darlene.

151
00:16:21,782 --> 00:16:24,410
That's, uh... quite a creative look

152
00:16:24,451 --> 00:16:26,942
you've got going there,
young lady.

153
00:16:26,987 --> 00:16:29,820
- What do you call that, huh?
- Death.

154
00:16:30,858 --> 00:16:34,487
Ah, death. That's cute.

155
00:16:35,562 --> 00:16:38,190
So tell me, David,
are you and Wendell

156
00:16:38,232 --> 00:16:42,362
still working over there
at Del Rancho?

157
00:16:42,403 --> 00:16:44,894
I don't know if I could work
at a slaughterhouse, huh?

158
00:16:44,938 --> 00:16:47,736
Yeah, well, my father
owned a farm

159
00:16:47,775 --> 00:16:50,403
when we were younger
and he did the same thing,

160
00:16:50,444 --> 00:16:52,878
so I guess it just
came naturally.

161
00:16:52,913 --> 00:16:54,904
Well...

162
00:16:55,949 --> 00:16:59,544
so, like, what do they have you
doing over there?

163
00:16:59,586 --> 00:17:01,577
I mean...

164
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:06,758
you don't have to kill the animals
and all that stuff, do you, David?

165
00:17:06,794 --> 00:17:09,991
Heavens, no.
No no, I'm a carver.

166
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:13,022
I take out the organs,
prep them, stuff like that.

167
00:17:13,067 --> 00:17:17,128
Yes, David has a real knack
for gutting the life out of things.

168
00:17:17,171 --> 00:17:19,264
Thank you, Darlene.

169
00:17:21,975 --> 00:17:24,808
So... too bad there's not--

170
00:17:24,845 --> 00:17:27,814
not a demand
on the black market for cow parts.

171
00:17:27,848 --> 00:17:31,409
You would be a rich man
by now.

172
00:17:31,452 --> 00:17:33,852
Not at the table,
please, Francis.

173
00:17:33,887 --> 00:17:38,256
I apologize. Paul, he's been
following us around with that thing

174
00:17:38,292 --> 00:17:41,523
for the past few days--
some sort of school project

175
00:17:41,562 --> 00:17:43,826
- or something or other.
- No, that's fine with me.

176
00:17:43,864 --> 00:17:47,857
I think it's kind of cool.
Francis, tell me about the project.

177
00:17:49,103 --> 00:17:52,470
Well, it's uh--

178
00:17:52,506 --> 00:17:56,943
I'm supposed to write
a report about my family--

179
00:17:56,977 --> 00:17:58,638
our family--

180
00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:03,241
and I just asked if I could
shoot a video instead.

181
00:18:03,283 --> 00:18:07,652
Good. Now, that's a good idea.
That is a great idea.

182
00:18:07,688 --> 00:18:09,747
- I hated doing papers. I hated it.
- Me too.

183
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:11,451
I really did.

184
00:18:11,492 --> 00:18:13,722
- Hey, gang.
- Hey, Wendell.

185
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:14,784
- Hey.
- How are you?

186
00:18:14,828 --> 00:18:17,991
- Good, Paul. How are you?
- Good, thanks.

187
00:18:18,031 --> 00:18:20,625
Am I late?

188
00:18:20,667 --> 00:18:23,158
What do you think,
Wendell?

189
00:18:23,203 --> 00:18:26,695
David,
may I please be excused?

190
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:28,867
- We're not finished eating.
- No no no, let the boy go.

191
00:18:28,909 --> 00:18:30,672
- Mm-hmm.
- He's probably bored out of his mind.

192
00:18:30,711 --> 00:18:33,612
- Where are you going, Francis?
- I used to have two younger brothers,

193
00:18:33,647 --> 00:18:35,615
so I understand these things.

194
00:18:35,649 --> 00:18:38,209
They are a handful.

195
00:18:58,605 --> 00:19:02,063
That was great, you guys.
Thanks a lot.

196
00:19:02,109 --> 00:19:04,737
I know I'm not much
of a cook, but I do try.

197
00:19:04,778 --> 00:19:08,475
Not to worry. You probably never
tasted my wife's cooking, huh?

198
00:19:14,788 --> 00:19:18,918
Well, I'll be in the kitchen
cleaning.

199
00:19:26,133 --> 00:19:28,397
Did you hear that?

200
00:19:31,004 --> 00:19:33,996
Oh, it's probably cats...

201
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:36,532
fucking.

202
00:19:38,579 --> 00:19:41,776
Yep, that's cats
fucking, all right--

203
00:19:41,815 --> 00:19:45,444
getting after it.
What do you think, David?

204
00:19:48,288 --> 00:19:50,916
Who'd have thought?

205
00:19:50,958 --> 00:19:52,892
- Listen, that was a great dinner.
- Thank you.

206
00:19:52,926 --> 00:19:54,553
- I'll talk to you soon.
- Thanks. Yeah.

207
00:19:54,595 --> 00:19:56,358
- Thanks, David.
- Good night, Paul.

208
00:19:56,396 --> 00:19:58,694
Good night.

209
00:20:24,157 --> 00:20:27,684
Need more padding on that south wall.
You can hear 'em upstairs.

210
00:20:28,695 --> 00:20:31,926
All right, so you're sure
that they're good?

211
00:20:31,965 --> 00:20:34,058
Positive. On a road trip,

212
00:20:34,101 --> 00:20:36,934
it's gonna be two, three weeks
before anyone notices.

213
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:39,404
- Healthy?
- Oh, yeah.

214
00:20:39,439 --> 00:20:42,806
- I even took one for a test drive.
- Quit acting up, okay?

215
00:20:42,843 --> 00:20:46,108
I don't want their faces showing up
on the 10:00 news like last time.

216
00:20:46,146 --> 00:20:49,013
- This could sustain us for awhile.
- Trust me.

217
00:20:50,017 --> 00:20:52,417
All right.
Let's get to work.

218
00:21:00,961 --> 00:21:04,192
- Help.
- Room service.

219
00:21:07,467 --> 00:21:10,800
How are we holding up, girls?
Good?

220
00:21:14,608 --> 00:21:17,702
Well, you're
looking good. Hi.

221
00:21:20,647 --> 00:21:22,979
I hope this doesn't change
anything between us.

222
00:21:23,016 --> 00:21:25,416
Wendell, what did I tell you?

223
00:21:26,987 --> 00:21:29,922
Come on, sweetheart.

224
00:21:29,956 --> 00:21:32,322
- Stop it!
- Come on.

225
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:34,953
Get up.
Oh, yeah!

226
00:21:34,995 --> 00:21:36,724
Don't worry, Sam.

227
00:21:36,763 --> 00:21:40,426
I still got something
right here, okay?

228
00:21:40,467 --> 00:21:43,095
All right, let's
get you up, huh?

229
00:21:43,136 --> 00:21:45,001
You're a live one,
aren't you?

230
00:21:45,038 --> 00:21:48,496
Let's tie you down here.
Let's get you down here.

231
00:21:57,651 --> 00:21:59,676
Is that too tight, sweetie?

232
00:22:15,302 --> 00:22:18,328
- Sounds like he's changing.
- Hey. Hey, Lenny.

233
00:22:19,639 --> 00:22:23,006
Poor guy's
probably hungry.

234
00:22:23,043 --> 00:22:26,877
We'll feed him later.
Just go keep watch.

235
00:22:28,715 --> 00:22:31,513
I'm gonna tuck you in
later, okay?

236
00:22:32,652 --> 00:22:34,176
I got you.

237
00:24:00,807 --> 00:24:02,968
Get in. I'll give you
a ride to school.

238
00:24:03,977 --> 00:24:07,413
I saw some stuff
I want to shoot, Wendell.

239
00:24:07,447 --> 00:24:09,438
Just get the fuck in.

240
00:24:10,517 --> 00:24:12,951
God damn.

241
00:24:17,691 --> 00:24:20,990
You gotta pop your cherry,
baby brother.

242
00:24:21,027 --> 00:24:23,018
Huh?

243
00:24:24,264 --> 00:24:28,223
So you can quit moping around,
playing with that camera.

244
00:24:30,737 --> 00:24:34,298
Hey! Hey.

245
00:24:34,341 --> 00:24:36,673
What, are you too good
to talk to me now?

246
00:24:38,678 --> 00:24:41,511
- Fuck you, Wendell!
- What?!

247
00:24:41,548 --> 00:24:43,709
- What the-- hey! Hey!
- Fuck you!

248
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:45,047
- Keep it up, Francis!
- No!

249
00:24:45,085 --> 00:24:48,782
Keep it up! We take care
of your sorry ass, all right?

250
00:24:48,822 --> 00:24:51,655
We feed you, we put fucking clothes
on your back,

251
00:24:51,691 --> 00:24:54,626
and you do nothing in return
but complain.

252
00:24:54,661 --> 00:24:56,720
Let go of me!

253
00:24:59,799 --> 00:25:01,892
Dude, l-- look,

254
00:25:01,935 --> 00:25:04,904
I know it fucking seems
fucked up, all right?

255
00:25:04,938 --> 00:25:07,566
But we do what we do

256
00:25:07,607 --> 00:25:09,598
to survive.

257
00:25:10,777 --> 00:25:12,768
All right?

258
00:25:14,848 --> 00:25:18,682
You do anything to fuck up
our family-- most importantly me--

259
00:25:18,718 --> 00:25:21,812
I'll fucking kill you, okay?

260
00:25:21,855 --> 00:25:24,483
Hey! Okay?

261
00:25:25,492 --> 00:25:27,483
Get the fuck out of my truck.

262
00:25:54,254 --> 00:25:57,883
Shut the fuck up
before I gut you myself!

263
00:26:15,542 --> 00:26:17,533
Bye, Lenny.

264
00:27:17,537 --> 00:27:19,528
Hello?

265
00:27:21,841 --> 00:27:24,309
Anybody home?

266
00:27:33,253 --> 00:27:35,551
Yes, hello.
This is David Hamilton.

267
00:27:35,588 --> 00:27:38,056
I'm calling on behalf
of Francis Hamilton.

268
00:27:38,091 --> 00:27:41,925
Yes yes. Yeah,
he's not feeling too well,

269
00:27:41,961 --> 00:27:44,293
got a case of the flu
or something.

270
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:45,991
Yeah, right right.

271
00:27:46,032 --> 00:27:48,000
Oh, thank you,
I appreciate it.

272
00:27:48,034 --> 00:27:50,161
Have a great day. Bye.

273
00:28:18,631 --> 00:28:22,328
Please don't hurt her
anymore.

274
00:28:24,003 --> 00:28:26,130
I'm not like them.

275
00:28:28,007 --> 00:28:31,238
Then can you help us,
please?

276
00:28:36,716 --> 00:28:38,877
I'm sorry, but I can't.

277
00:28:39,886 --> 00:28:44,050
- Please.
- I don't even have a key.

278
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:46,957
Do something, please.

279
00:28:49,262 --> 00:28:52,425
I can give you
something to drink.

280
00:28:52,465 --> 00:28:54,695
Do you want
something to drink?

281
00:29:47,086 --> 00:29:49,850
She needs some, please.

282
00:29:51,224 --> 00:29:53,317
I don't have a key.

283
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:55,884
She just needs water.
She's dying.

284
00:29:58,431 --> 00:30:01,400
I have to go.
Someone will be here soon.

285
00:30:09,676 --> 00:30:11,007
Please.

286
00:31:12,639 --> 00:31:15,267
The top drawer, eh?

287
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:25,811
You need a fake ID?

288
00:31:25,852 --> 00:31:27,752
Where did you get all those?

289
00:31:27,787 --> 00:31:29,846
I know a guy in the city.

290
00:31:29,889 --> 00:31:32,449
You want one?
I won't charge you.

291
00:31:32,492 --> 00:31:35,120
Yeah.

292
00:31:35,161 --> 00:31:37,721
Let's see.

293
00:31:37,764 --> 00:31:40,426
>>DRIVER LICENSE<<
Here we go-- Dani Cummings.

294
00:31:40,466 --> 00:31:44,232
Oh, look she's an organ donor.
How sweet!

295
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:46,261
Seems about your height...

296
00:31:46,306 --> 00:31:48,365
- Blonde hair.
- That's okay.

297
00:31:48,408 --> 00:31:51,172
What are you little girls doing?

298
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:53,974
We are just getting comfortable

299
00:31:54,013 --> 00:31:56,004
and throwing in a flick.

300
00:31:56,049 --> 00:31:58,279
You wanna watch?

301
00:31:58,318 --> 00:32:01,685
I'd love to watch.

302
00:32:06,693 --> 00:32:08,126
Where were you, Francis?

303
00:32:08,161 --> 00:32:10,959
I was just down by the river

304
00:32:10,997 --> 00:32:12,988
filming some stuff.

305
00:32:13,032 --> 00:32:15,091
Pretty late, huh?

306
00:32:15,134 --> 00:32:17,295
Yeah, I guess.

307
00:32:17,337 --> 00:32:19,168
Well, I'm going out
for a little bit.

308
00:32:23,509 --> 00:32:25,841
So if you need anything...

309
00:32:27,513 --> 00:32:29,504
All right.

310
00:32:30,917 --> 00:32:32,908
All right. I'll see you later.

311
00:33:42,255 --> 00:33:45,053
Turn it off, turn it off!

312
00:33:46,592 --> 00:33:49,026
It's just a movie, sweetheart.

313
00:33:49,062 --> 00:33:51,053
I thought you liked
this kind of stuff.

314
00:33:51,097 --> 00:33:54,191
Well, I do.

315
00:33:54,233 --> 00:33:57,725
It's just these movies
are too real sometimes.

316
00:33:57,770 --> 00:34:00,034
Kitty, if monsters were real,

317
00:34:00,073 --> 00:34:02,598
they'd be a lot different
than they are on TV.

318
00:34:03,643 --> 00:34:06,840
Well, I just can't stand
being scared.

319
00:34:07,914 --> 00:34:11,543
Well, what do you
wanna do now?

320
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:14,178
Let's play a game.

321
00:34:16,456 --> 00:34:19,482
What kind of game?

322
00:34:19,525 --> 00:34:22,926
Let's play truth or dare.

323
00:34:22,962 --> 00:34:25,624
What?

324
00:34:25,665 --> 00:34:27,656
Around here we only play

325
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:31,227
dare or double dare,
if you can handle it.

326
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:33,704
- What about truth?
- No truth.

327
00:34:33,739 --> 00:34:37,072
Dares just keep doubling
until someone gets hurt.

328
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:39,544
- Play nice, Wendell.
- I am.

329
00:34:39,579 --> 00:34:41,479
Okay, Kitty,
you can even go first.

330
00:34:41,514 --> 00:34:43,505
All right.

331
00:34:44,951 --> 00:34:46,851
- Dare or double dare?
- Me?

332
00:34:46,886 --> 00:34:49,116
If you can handle it.

333
00:34:50,823 --> 00:34:52,290
Dare.

334
00:34:52,325 --> 00:34:55,852
I dare you...

335
00:34:57,797 --> 00:35:01,494
to finish your beer
in one drink.

336
00:35:10,743 --> 00:35:13,405
Okay, my turn.

337
00:35:13,446 --> 00:35:15,971
Kitty,

338
00:35:16,015 --> 00:35:17,676
dare or double dare?

339
00:35:17,717 --> 00:35:19,207
Double dare.

340
00:35:19,252 --> 00:35:21,516
Double dare?

341
00:35:23,656 --> 00:35:26,591
I double dare you...

342
00:35:26,626 --> 00:35:28,617
to...

343
00:35:29,662 --> 00:35:32,529
make out with Darlene.

344
00:35:36,869 --> 00:35:38,996
You think I won't?

345
00:35:39,038 --> 00:35:40,869
Well, if you don't,
you lose.

346
00:35:41,874 --> 00:35:45,071
I mean, we could play Scrabble
or something, if you want.

347
00:36:03,496 --> 00:36:05,862
Not bad.

348
00:36:05,898 --> 00:36:08,992
- You surprise me.
- I'm full of them.

349
00:36:09,035 --> 00:36:11,196
Aren't we all?

350
00:36:11,237 --> 00:36:14,604
Okay, Kitty.
It's your turn again.

351
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,108
All right, Darlene...

352
00:36:17,143 --> 00:36:20,340
- dare or double dare?
- Triple dare.

353
00:36:20,379 --> 00:36:23,507
- Triple dare? Come on--
- Triple dare.

354
00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:27,016
Okay...

355
00:36:27,053 --> 00:36:30,921
I triple dare you and Wendell
to make out.

356
00:36:32,858 --> 00:36:35,326
Huh?

357
00:36:35,361 --> 00:36:37,158
Make out with her?

358
00:36:38,164 --> 00:36:39,859
You are a--

359
00:36:39,899 --> 00:36:41,764
just a kinky little thing,
aren't you?

360
00:36:41,801 --> 00:36:43,792
I win.

361
00:36:43,836 --> 00:36:45,565
I don't think so.

362
00:37:15,268 --> 00:37:17,566
Come on in.

363
00:37:17,603 --> 00:37:19,662
- Nice house.
- Thank you.

364
00:37:19,705 --> 00:37:21,866
- And the flowers--
- Yeah.

365
00:37:26,512 --> 00:37:29,310
This is the sort
of fall foliage...

366
00:37:29,348 --> 00:37:31,509
Oh, yeah.

367
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:33,984
This is the wood--
woodland room.

368
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:35,749
This is nice.
I like that frame right there.

369
00:37:35,788 --> 00:37:37,312
- Thank you, thank you.
- Very nice work.

370
00:37:37,356 --> 00:37:39,324
Thank you.
I picked it out myself.

371
00:37:39,358 --> 00:37:41,519
Very nicely hung.

372
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:44,154
We really shouldn't be here.

373
00:37:44,196 --> 00:37:47,654
- Why is that?
- Just--

374
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:50,498
get in trouble.

375
00:37:50,536 --> 00:37:53,004
We could go to your room
and be quiet.

376
00:37:53,039 --> 00:37:55,633
I don't know, it's kind of--

377
00:37:55,675 --> 00:37:57,870
Come on.

378
00:38:00,646 --> 00:38:02,614
- Okay.
- Okay?

379
00:38:02,648 --> 00:38:04,582
Okay. Just, we gotta be
really quiet, okay?

380
00:38:04,617 --> 00:38:06,881
Okay.

381
00:38:58,304 --> 00:39:01,273
No. No!

382
00:39:01,307 --> 00:39:03,298
No!

383
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:37,008
No!

384
00:39:37,042 --> 00:39:40,273
Help!

385
00:39:41,647 --> 00:39:43,410
So, sure you
don't want some?

386
00:39:43,449 --> 00:39:44,939
I'm buying.

387
00:39:46,252 --> 00:39:48,311
Pretty good!

388
00:39:48,354 --> 00:39:50,845
No, I'm fine,
thank you.

389
00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:53,188
So...

390
00:39:53,225 --> 00:39:55,216
what did you want
to talk about?

391
00:39:56,996 --> 00:40:00,557
It uh-- you know, something
at school? Something?

392
00:40:09,175 --> 00:40:11,700
My fucking family, just--

393
00:40:11,744 --> 00:40:14,144
I'm sorry?

394
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:16,774
Yeah, Paul, it's school and stuff,
you know?

395
00:40:16,816 --> 00:40:19,785
- Yeah.
- Teachers and stuff, you know?

396
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:24,012
You know, I don't know if I ever
told you about this, but--

397
00:40:24,056 --> 00:40:28,789
my dad, when he was
an army captain and--

398
00:40:28,828 --> 00:40:31,353
we moved from base to base,
it seemed like--

399
00:40:31,397 --> 00:40:34,298
Christ, every--
every year or so.

400
00:40:34,333 --> 00:40:37,962
So I know what
it's like to be--

401
00:40:38,003 --> 00:40:40,494
Francis.
Hey, I'm over here, pal.

402
00:40:40,539 --> 00:40:43,997
Yo, Francis, I'm over here.
Francis.

403
00:40:48,981 --> 00:40:50,949
I'm gonna go, Paul.

404
00:40:50,983 --> 00:40:52,951
I have homework and stuff,
you know?

405
00:40:52,985 --> 00:40:56,546
- Just--
- All right.

406
00:40:56,589 --> 00:40:59,490
Well, I'Il--

407
00:40:59,525 --> 00:41:02,494
I'll stop by in a couple of days
and I'Il--

408
00:41:02,528 --> 00:41:05,497
I'll check up on you, all right?
Here. There you go.

409
00:41:07,066 --> 00:41:09,557
- Thanks.
- You're all right?

410
00:41:09,602 --> 00:41:11,593
Yeah.

411
00:41:11,637 --> 00:41:13,764
- Okay.
- Thanks for the soda.

412
00:41:13,806 --> 00:41:15,569
Sure.

413
00:41:15,608 --> 00:41:17,599
You take care, pal.

414
00:42:20,272 --> 00:42:22,706
Wendell, what the fuck
are you doing?

415
00:42:22,741 --> 00:42:25,232
Oh, hey, Francis.

416
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:30,478
I didn't know you had
a girlfriend.

417
00:42:32,585 --> 00:42:35,611
Seems really nice, huh?

418
00:42:39,224 --> 00:42:40,885
I saw your little movie too--

419
00:42:40,926 --> 00:42:42,655
creepy.

420
00:42:44,430 --> 00:42:46,864
This is a lot of fun,

421
00:42:46,899 --> 00:42:49,367
a lot of fun.

422
00:42:49,401 --> 00:42:51,266
You don't mind sharing
with the family, do you?

423
00:42:54,173 --> 00:42:57,700
You know, I gotta hand it
to you, brother,

424
00:42:57,743 --> 00:43:00,803
you're a lot more like us
than I thought, aren't you?

425
00:43:02,848 --> 00:43:05,373
She's pretty good-Iooking too.

426
00:43:05,417 --> 00:43:07,248
You know, I had
this good idea though.

427
00:43:07,286 --> 00:43:10,449
I was thinking that we--

428
00:43:10,489 --> 00:43:13,890
oh, yeah, look at that.
Look at that.

429
00:43:13,926 --> 00:43:16,690
We could make our own porn movies
down here if we want.

430
00:43:16,729 --> 00:43:19,425
Bitch, huh?

431
00:43:19,465 --> 00:43:22,628
How do you like that?
Huh, Francis?

432
00:43:22,668 --> 00:43:24,499
Huh? Come on, brother,
let's see what you got.

433
00:43:24,536 --> 00:43:28,028
Let's see what you got--
oh, yeah! You fuck!

434
00:43:28,073 --> 00:43:31,008
Come on, bud. Come on, big guy.
Is that all you got?

435
00:43:31,043 --> 00:43:33,011
Is that all you got?
That's what I thought, bitch.

436
00:43:33,045 --> 00:43:35,809
Hey, Sam, how about your little hero
now, huh? Huh?

437
00:43:45,591 --> 00:43:47,786
- Fuck!
- No!

438
00:43:47,826 --> 00:43:50,590
- Get over here! Come on.
- Wendell.

439
00:43:50,629 --> 00:43:53,962
You fucking bitch! Huh? You wanna
show off for that fucking bitch?

440
00:43:53,999 --> 00:43:57,127
Huh? I'll let you.
Come on, Lenny, come and get it!

441
00:43:57,169 --> 00:43:59,137
Come on, Lenny.

442
00:43:59,171 --> 00:44:01,969
Check it out.

443
00:44:08,247 --> 00:44:10,681
You like that feeling, bitch?

444
00:44:10,716 --> 00:44:12,707
Come on.

445
00:44:12,751 --> 00:44:16,744
Hey. Hey, Sam, keep it up.
You keep putting shit in his head,

446
00:44:16,789 --> 00:44:19,257
I'm gonna skin you both
alive, all right?

447
00:44:20,292 --> 00:44:22,351
- Please.
- What was that?

448
00:44:23,762 --> 00:44:25,753
Excuse me?

449
00:44:28,233 --> 00:44:30,758
I'm sorry, I don't think
I heard you right.

450
00:44:30,803 --> 00:44:33,431
What was that? Huh?

451
00:44:33,472 --> 00:44:35,463
What was that?

452
00:44:36,575 --> 00:44:39,237
Okay, I'll tell you what,

453
00:44:39,278 --> 00:44:41,678
why don't you hang out here
for awhile?

454
00:44:41,714 --> 00:44:45,810
I'll come back down and we'll finish
what we started, okay?

455
00:44:45,851 --> 00:44:47,842
You can scream
all you want, Sam.

456
00:44:47,886 --> 00:44:49,786
Just know one thing:

457
00:44:49,822 --> 00:44:53,280
I am going to kill you.

458
00:44:53,325 --> 00:44:55,350
All right?

459
00:45:52,718 --> 00:45:55,186
What are you doing
here, Francis?

460
00:45:55,220 --> 00:45:58,951
- We need to talk.
- What happened to your hand?

461
00:45:58,991 --> 00:46:00,982
Wendell.

462
00:46:02,327 --> 00:46:04,887
I'm working here, Francis.
You know, you can't come running to me

463
00:46:04,930 --> 00:46:09,299
- every time you two have a fight.
- Yeah, but--

464
00:46:09,334 --> 00:46:12,360
I'm getting awfully tired
of your hullabaloo, okay?

465
00:46:12,404 --> 00:46:14,838
Wendell, school...

466
00:46:14,873 --> 00:46:18,866
I can't be with you
24 hours a day, bud.

467
00:46:18,911 --> 00:46:21,675
I have no one else
to talk to, David.

468
00:46:25,250 --> 00:46:27,445
I'm working a double shift
here, okay?

469
00:46:27,486 --> 00:46:31,752
Don't you think it's time you started
trying to handle your own problems?

470
00:46:33,292 --> 00:46:36,386
What would you do, huh?

471
00:46:39,231 --> 00:46:41,222
What do you want me to say?

472
00:46:41,266 --> 00:46:43,791
God.

473
00:46:43,836 --> 00:46:46,327
Man,

474
00:46:46,371 --> 00:46:48,339
I just wish Mom and Dad
were still--

475
00:46:48,373 --> 00:46:50,671
They're dead, Francis, okay?
When are you gonna--

476
00:46:54,746 --> 00:46:57,237
when are you gonna
understand that?

477
00:46:57,282 --> 00:47:00,683
Just go home, okay?
We'll talk about this later.

478
00:47:03,689 --> 00:47:06,522
No. You know what?
Fuck you, David!

479
00:47:06,558 --> 00:47:09,789
Fuck you!
I don't need your help.

480
00:47:09,828 --> 00:47:12,126
Don't even fucking worry
about it.

481
00:47:35,254 --> 00:47:38,155
Hey, Wendell.
Is Darlene home?

482
00:47:39,157 --> 00:47:41,182
She's in her room.

483
00:47:47,132 --> 00:47:50,295
So, what are you doing tonight?

484
00:47:53,538 --> 00:47:56,598
You know I'm spending
the night again.

485
00:47:58,510 --> 00:48:00,876
Darlene?

486
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:04,171
Hey.

487
00:48:15,861 --> 00:48:18,694
- Is she here?
- No.

488
00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:22,689
I meant, she's coming back
in a bit.

489
00:48:26,038 --> 00:48:28,336
No one's here,
it's just you and me.

490
00:48:30,509 --> 00:48:34,946
Okay, well, I'll just
come back later then.

491
00:48:36,882 --> 00:48:39,976
Why not stay
and wait here, huh?

492
00:48:40,018 --> 00:48:43,818
I should probably
just come back.

493
00:48:43,855 --> 00:48:45,846
Really?

494
00:48:45,891 --> 00:48:48,052
Yeah.

495
00:48:48,093 --> 00:48:50,084
What's the rush?

496
00:49:01,974 --> 00:49:03,703
Anyone ever tell you

497
00:49:03,742 --> 00:49:06,370
you smell absolutely delicious?

498
00:49:06,411 --> 00:49:08,402
Huh?

499
00:49:12,250 --> 00:49:15,151
I bet you taste even better.

500
00:49:16,288 --> 00:49:18,586
- Hey.
- Hi, guys.

501
00:49:20,859 --> 00:49:23,089
I guess you're spending
the night, Kitty?

502
00:49:24,096 --> 00:49:26,087
Yeah.

503
00:49:27,099 --> 00:49:29,090
Come on.

504
00:49:32,771 --> 00:49:35,035
What was that?

505
00:49:36,541 --> 00:49:38,532
He's so weird.

506
00:50:09,408 --> 00:50:12,866
You keep telling yourself
that things will change...

507
00:50:14,146 --> 00:50:18,173
that it's all a bad dream
and one day you'll wake up.

508
00:50:18,216 --> 00:50:22,118
I just wish they would catch us
and then it would be all over.

509
00:50:35,934 --> 00:50:38,027
Stay away from me.

510
00:50:38,070 --> 00:50:40,766
I'm not going to hurt you.

511
00:50:40,806 --> 00:50:44,037
You killed my friend.

512
00:50:54,386 --> 00:50:56,854
I brought you some food.

513
00:50:58,924 --> 00:51:02,257
It's all I could afford.

514
00:51:02,294 --> 00:51:05,127
Is that a joke?

515
00:51:05,163 --> 00:51:07,996
Just go away.

516
00:51:08,033 --> 00:51:11,161
Just go away.

517
00:51:14,039 --> 00:51:15,836
Don't worry.

518
00:51:15,874 --> 00:51:17,865
It's just Lenny.

519
00:51:21,813 --> 00:51:23,906
What's Lenny?

520
00:51:23,949 --> 00:51:26,008
You wouldn't believe me
if I told you.

521
00:51:26,051 --> 00:51:30,215
You kill people and you feed it
to something you call Lenny?

522
00:51:30,255 --> 00:51:33,691
We're not like you, okay?

523
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:37,993
We're sick. We have
a fucking disease.

524
00:51:38,029 --> 00:51:41,829
Yeah, you're sick.
You are.

525
00:51:45,337 --> 00:51:47,328
I should go.

526
00:51:48,373 --> 00:51:50,364
Wait.

527
00:51:53,311 --> 00:51:56,769
Can I have some
of that food, please?

528
00:52:02,154 --> 00:52:04,588
It's just--

529
00:52:05,590 --> 00:52:08,354
they'd kill me if they knew
I was here.

530
00:52:28,713 --> 00:52:30,738
- This is looking good.
- Which color are you using?

531
00:52:30,782 --> 00:52:32,409
- This one in here.
- I like it.

532
00:52:32,450 --> 00:52:35,908
Yeah. Okay.

533
00:52:35,954 --> 00:52:38,184
Okay, get you doing this.

534
00:52:39,191 --> 00:52:41,455
I'm just not good at it.

535
00:52:41,493 --> 00:52:44,826
No, just need
a little practice.

536
00:53:20,131 --> 00:53:22,565
Thank you.

537
00:53:26,171 --> 00:53:28,503
What's your name?

538
00:53:30,709 --> 00:53:32,904
Francis.

539
00:53:34,145 --> 00:53:37,478
Can I ask you
something, Francis?

540
00:53:41,419 --> 00:53:43,910
Why did you
bring me food?

541
00:53:45,357 --> 00:53:48,087
Because...

542
00:53:48,126 --> 00:53:50,890
I'm not one of them.

543
00:53:53,431 --> 00:53:56,662
They're gonna
kill me, Francis.

544
00:53:57,669 --> 00:53:59,660
I know.

545
00:54:03,808 --> 00:54:07,608
All you have to do
is call the police.

546
00:54:07,646 --> 00:54:09,637
Please.

547
00:54:10,949 --> 00:54:12,974
My family has money.

548
00:54:13,018 --> 00:54:15,316
They'll give you
anything you need.

549
00:54:16,454 --> 00:54:19,252
You don't understand.
I can't.

550
00:54:19,291 --> 00:54:21,885
Yes, you can.

551
00:54:21,926 --> 00:54:24,588
Yes, you can!

552
00:54:26,631 --> 00:54:28,963
Francis, I have people

553
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:32,333
who love me, who need me.

554
00:54:32,370 --> 00:54:35,635
I just want to go home.

555
00:54:35,674 --> 00:54:37,904
I want to see my family.

556
00:54:37,942 --> 00:54:41,139
And what about my family?
They're all I have.

557
00:54:41,179 --> 00:54:43,841
They're killers, Francis.

558
00:54:43,882 --> 00:54:45,543
They're not a family.

559
00:54:45,583 --> 00:54:48,347
I can't survive--

560
00:54:48,386 --> 00:54:51,219
can't survive
without them.

561
00:56:27,786 --> 00:56:29,777
Shit.

562
00:56:42,033 --> 00:56:44,024
Hello?

563
00:56:47,038 --> 00:56:50,030
Wendell, are you
messing with me?

564
00:57:00,185 --> 00:57:02,585
Oh my God, you scared
the shit out of me!

565
00:57:02,620 --> 00:57:05,487
Really? What happened?
Let me see.

566
00:57:05,523 --> 00:57:08,492
- Oh my God.
- Can I kiss it and make it better?

567
00:57:11,062 --> 00:57:14,327
I'll just clean it off
in the bathroom.

568
00:57:28,847 --> 00:57:30,838
- Oh, that's a lot of blood.
- Yeah<i>..</i>

569
00:57:30,882 --> 00:57:34,113
- Let me help you.
- Darlene, come on.

570
00:57:34,152 --> 00:57:36,313
Hey, Wendell.

571
00:57:36,354 --> 00:57:39,346
Hey. That's a nasty cut.

572
00:57:39,390 --> 00:57:41,654
Yeah. Wendell, was that you
fucking with me out in the hall?

573
00:57:41,693 --> 00:57:44,890
- Not me. Must've been Darlene.
- Oh, tell the truth, Wendell.

574
00:57:44,929 --> 00:57:47,124
- Truth or dare?
- Ooh, you up for another game, Kitty?

575
00:57:47,165 --> 00:57:48,860
- Can I go first?
- Be my guest.

576
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:51,460
- Okay. Darlene, dare or double dare?
- Yeah? I don't know,

577
00:57:51,503 --> 00:57:54,563
I'm feeling a little frisky tonight.
How about a double dare to start?

578
00:57:54,606 --> 00:57:56,699
- I double dare you--
- What the hell--?

579
00:57:56,741 --> 00:58:00,006
--to give Kitty a little
seductive dance.

580
00:58:01,079 --> 00:58:02,637
Darlene?

581
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:05,672
You guys, stop.

582
00:58:05,717 --> 00:58:07,947
Darlene, why are you
doing this?

583
00:58:07,986 --> 00:58:10,682
Stop!
Darlene, stop!

584
00:58:13,758 --> 00:58:16,386
Double dare
or triple dare, Kitty?

585
00:58:16,427 --> 00:58:19,055
I triple dare you to let Wendell
kiss you on the lips.

586
00:58:37,048 --> 00:58:40,074
Here, Kitty Kitty.

587
00:58:40,118 --> 00:58:42,951
Come on, pussycat.

588
00:58:42,987 --> 00:58:45,353
Where are you going, babe?

589
00:58:47,892 --> 00:58:49,883
Where are you going, pussy?

590
00:58:49,928 --> 00:58:52,590
Here, Kitty, Kitty,
Kitty, Kitty.

591
00:58:53,598 --> 00:58:56,089
I don't want
to talk to you in there.

592
00:58:58,403 --> 00:59:00,735
We're not done
with our game yet.

593
00:59:49,053 --> 00:59:51,419
How long have I been out?

594
00:59:51,456 --> 00:59:54,289
Not long--

595
00:59:54,325 --> 00:59:56,384
hour or two.

596
00:59:56,427 --> 00:59:58,861
Somebody will be here soon.

597
00:59:58,896 --> 01:00:00,887
I should go.

598
01:00:08,706 --> 01:00:10,697
Francis...

599
01:00:13,444 --> 01:00:16,106
Thank you for talking to me.

600
01:00:19,183 --> 01:00:21,777
I'm sorry, but...

601
01:00:23,454 --> 01:00:25,115
l--

602
01:00:25,156 --> 01:00:28,182
I can help you out there.

603
01:00:30,128 --> 01:00:33,655
I can help you
without your family.

604
01:00:33,698 --> 01:00:37,065
You don't need them,
Francis.

605
01:00:39,170 --> 01:00:41,695
I'll take care of you.

606
01:00:46,444 --> 01:00:49,106
I'll take care of you.

607
01:00:50,248 --> 01:00:53,183
Please, don't kill me.

608
01:00:57,522 --> 01:01:01,151
You're leaving me here
to die.

609
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:04,151
I know.

610
01:01:24,716 --> 01:01:26,911
Hey, Dad, over here.

611
01:01:27,919 --> 01:01:30,046
Did you know your redwood
is in violation

612
01:01:30,088 --> 01:01:32,079
of the neighborhood safety
growth code?

613
01:01:32,123 --> 01:01:34,216
- No.
- Uh-huh.

614
01:01:34,258 --> 01:01:36,954
That's a good job, son.
Hi, I'm Larry Davies.

615
01:01:36,994 --> 01:01:40,930
I'm-- I'm Katherine--
Kitty's uncle.

616
01:01:40,965 --> 01:01:44,423
- Kitty is a friend of Darlene's.
- Yeah, sure.

617
01:01:44,469 --> 01:01:47,302
Yeah. This is my son, Allen.

618
01:01:47,338 --> 01:01:50,432
Lieutenant Commander Daniels,
private sector.

619
01:01:50,475 --> 01:01:52,568
David Hamilton.

620
01:01:52,610 --> 01:01:55,078
Just for your information,
Kitty's gonna be staying with us

621
01:01:55,113 --> 01:01:59,174
this college semester.
So if you see her around, that's why.

622
01:02:00,985 --> 01:02:02,475
Is everything all right?

623
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:05,387
Yeah. Look, I'm sure
it's nothing.

624
01:02:05,423 --> 01:02:08,551
We're just a little worried, that's all.
We haven't heard from her all day

625
01:02:08,593 --> 01:02:11,528
and she isn't answering
her cell phone.

626
01:02:11,562 --> 01:02:13,553
Is she here, by chance?

627
01:02:13,598 --> 01:02:16,226
Unfortunately, no one's here.

628
01:02:16,267 --> 01:02:18,758
Darlene doesn't have
a cell phone--

629
01:02:18,803 --> 01:02:21,431
brain tumors.

630
01:02:24,275 --> 01:02:27,733
That's strange, you know?
It's just not like her.

631
01:02:27,779 --> 01:02:31,840
She said she was gonna be spending
the night here last night with Darlene,

632
01:02:31,883 --> 01:02:35,819
and she knew we had plans
for this morning.

633
01:02:35,853 --> 01:02:37,844
I put a couple of calls in

634
01:02:37,889 --> 01:02:41,052
to some friends of mine
down at the local sheriff's office,

635
01:02:41,092 --> 01:02:43,720
just in case.

636
01:02:43,761 --> 01:02:47,754
But if you hear from her,
please call that number.

637
01:02:47,799 --> 01:02:50,563
Of course, of course.

638
01:02:50,601 --> 01:02:53,229
Hey, look, l--

639
01:02:53,271 --> 01:02:55,637
I know we are bothering you
and all that,

640
01:02:55,673 --> 01:02:57,732
but we didn't have
your number.

641
01:02:57,775 --> 01:03:01,267
So we just thought
we'd pop by and check.

642
01:03:01,312 --> 01:03:02,973
So, if something turns up--

643
01:03:03,014 --> 01:03:05,039
Just let me know
if there's anything I can do.

644
01:03:08,753 --> 01:03:10,744
Take care.

645
01:03:20,965 --> 01:03:22,626
What did you do?

646
01:03:22,667 --> 01:03:25,329
Why, nothing, David.

647
01:03:25,369 --> 01:03:27,929
She left here this morning.
We really haven't seen her since.

648
01:03:27,972 --> 01:03:29,997
I can't believe
you two did this!

649
01:03:30,041 --> 01:03:32,475
Oh, and what
about the dozen homos

650
01:03:32,510 --> 01:03:34,808
you have buried
under the house?

651
01:03:34,846 --> 01:03:37,406
Yeah, Mr. Perfect,
how do you explain that?

652
01:03:37,448 --> 01:03:39,939
Are you that blind in your
make-believe world,

653
01:03:39,984 --> 01:03:41,815
you don't think we know?

654
01:03:41,853 --> 01:03:43,980
I use my head!

655
01:03:44,021 --> 01:03:46,819
I pick transients
and drifters,

656
01:03:46,858 --> 01:03:49,656
not some neighborhood girl
whose cousin or--

657
01:03:49,694 --> 01:03:52,094
or brother or whatever
is the police!

658
01:03:52,129 --> 01:03:54,996
You know why you hate us
so much, David?

659
01:03:55,032 --> 01:03:58,058
It's because
we represent everything

660
01:03:58,102 --> 01:03:59,899
you wish you could have,

661
01:03:59,937 --> 01:04:03,168
but are just too afraid
to face.

662
01:04:18,756 --> 01:04:21,156
You two always--

663
01:04:21,192 --> 01:04:22,921
fuck it up!

664
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:27,021
Are you trying
to scare us, David,

665
01:04:27,064 --> 01:04:30,090
like when we were kids?

666
01:04:30,134 --> 01:04:32,398
We're not little kids anymore.

667
01:04:32,436 --> 01:04:34,529
So what are you
gonna do, David?

668
01:04:34,572 --> 01:04:36,699
When are you gonna realize
this isn't the first time

669
01:04:36,741 --> 01:04:39,904
and certainly not the last time
it's gonna happen?

670
01:04:39,944 --> 01:04:42,538
Pull it together.

671
01:04:42,580 --> 01:04:44,571
Hey!

672
01:04:47,685 --> 01:04:50,654
- Mom and Dad--
- Mom and Dad were the exception.

673
01:04:50,688 --> 01:04:54,385
None of us have the kind
of self-control to have what they did.

674
01:04:54,425 --> 01:04:56,586
The only difference
between you and us, David,

675
01:04:56,627 --> 01:04:58,925
is we don't look at ourselves
in the mirror and lie.

676
01:04:58,963 --> 01:05:01,523
We accept who we are.

677
01:05:01,565 --> 01:05:03,260
We don't deny it.

678
01:05:05,569 --> 01:05:07,901
We have to move again.

679
01:05:12,209 --> 01:05:15,838
All right, pack up
what we need--

680
01:06:28,819 --> 01:06:30,480
- Hi, this is Paul.
- Hey, Paul--

681
01:06:30,521 --> 01:06:32,455
Please leave your message
at the sound of the tone.

682
01:06:32,490 --> 01:06:35,186
Don't forget to leave
your phone number. Bye.

683
01:06:35,226 --> 01:06:37,251
Paul, it's Francis.

684
01:06:37,294 --> 01:06:40,263
There's something really important
we gotta talk about

685
01:06:40,297 --> 01:06:43,198
about my family
and um...

686
01:06:43,234 --> 01:06:45,964
I can't-- I can't do it
over the phone.

687
01:06:46,003 --> 01:06:48,233
If you could meet me in person,
that'd be great.

688
01:06:48,272 --> 01:06:50,763
l-l-I just--
fuck!

689
01:06:50,808 --> 01:06:52,799
I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

690
01:07:15,299 --> 01:07:18,029
I know, Lenny.
I know.

691
01:07:18,069 --> 01:07:20,697
It's coming.

692
01:07:20,738 --> 01:07:23,764
It's coming, Lenny!
Please sit still.

693
01:08:08,185 --> 01:08:10,676
Actually, it's--
it's kind of funny.

694
01:08:10,721 --> 01:08:14,452
My father taught me
how to do this.

695
01:08:14,492 --> 01:08:16,551
It's kooky, I know,
I know.

696
01:08:16,594 --> 01:08:19,358
He just wanted to make sure
if something were to happen to him,

697
01:08:19,396 --> 01:08:21,694
we'd still survive.

698
01:08:22,733 --> 01:08:26,829
Now you gotta get it
just right, so no air gets in.

699
01:08:27,838 --> 01:08:30,363
It has a longer shelf life
that way.

700
01:08:31,375 --> 01:08:33,366
It's kind of like...

701
01:08:34,912 --> 01:08:36,903
frozen food.

702
01:08:38,215 --> 01:08:40,206
You have something
on your face there.

703
01:08:40,251 --> 01:08:41,980
Oh, I apologize,

704
01:08:42,019 --> 01:08:45,079
I don't mean to make you
self-conscious or anything.

705
01:08:46,690 --> 01:08:48,681
"David," he said,
"David--

706
01:08:48,726 --> 01:08:52,218
David, one day
you might have to be

707
01:08:52,263 --> 01:08:54,254
the man of this family.

708
01:08:57,401 --> 01:08:59,369
David...

709
01:08:59,403 --> 01:09:01,871
David," he said--
he said, "David,

710
01:09:01,906 --> 01:09:05,171
you might have to be
the one that takes care

711
01:09:05,209 --> 01:09:07,700
of your brothers
and your sister."

712
01:09:08,779 --> 01:09:11,145
And I do, I do,

713
01:09:11,182 --> 01:09:13,810
but they don't care.

714
01:09:13,851 --> 01:09:16,149
Do you think they appreciate
what I do for them?

715
01:09:16,187 --> 01:09:19,850
No no no no.

716
01:09:26,463 --> 01:09:28,693
Look, missy,

717
01:09:28,732 --> 01:09:31,223
I don't mean to be a rude cunt,
but it sort of seems to me

718
01:09:31,268 --> 01:09:34,032
that you're not listening
to me.

719
01:09:34,071 --> 01:09:36,232
I just want
what's best for them.

720
01:09:37,608 --> 01:09:39,667
I just want what's
best for them.

721
01:09:39,710 --> 01:09:42,804
I just want
what's best for them.

722
01:10:19,216 --> 01:10:21,514
Goodbye, Lenny.

723
01:11:05,729 --> 01:11:07,720
Francis?

724
01:11:10,768 --> 01:11:12,759
Hey, Francis,
I got your message.

725
01:11:17,441 --> 01:11:20,035
Francis?

726
01:11:31,221 --> 01:11:33,951
David, are you here?
Francis?

727
01:11:38,329 --> 01:11:40,320
Francis?

728
01:11:44,268 --> 01:11:46,259
Francis, is that you?

729
01:11:49,273 --> 01:11:51,400
Francis, you out here?

730
01:12:28,212 --> 01:12:30,203
Hello?

731
01:13:08,986 --> 01:13:11,682
David? David?

732
01:13:11,722 --> 01:13:13,383
Da--

733
01:13:15,192 --> 01:13:16,921
David?

734
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:18,951
David?

735
01:13:22,499 --> 01:13:24,296
David?

736
01:13:24,334 --> 01:13:26,700
Hello?

737
01:13:26,737 --> 01:13:30,138
David, are you all right?
Hey, I'll try to get you out.

738
01:13:31,942 --> 01:13:34,342
Here, listen, I'm gonna--

739
01:13:34,378 --> 01:13:37,006
shit.

740
01:13:37,047 --> 01:13:40,414
You hiding there, huh?
Are you all right?

741
01:13:41,652 --> 01:13:44,985
Hi. Everything's going to be okay.

742
01:13:45,022 --> 01:13:47,081
Stop it, stop--

743
01:13:47,124 --> 01:13:49,285
What are you doing?

744
01:13:51,395 --> 01:13:53,192
What are you doing?!

745
01:13:53,230 --> 01:13:55,425
- Ah, no!
- No, Lenny!

746
01:13:55,466 --> 01:13:57,696
No! Stop!

747
01:13:57,734 --> 01:14:00,430
No no!

748
01:14:16,186 --> 01:14:19,644
Ooh, what happened?

749
01:14:22,159 --> 01:14:24,787
- He's still alive. We can drain him.
- Not him.

750
01:14:26,864 --> 01:14:29,162
Aren't you the one who said
they're just cattle to us

751
01:14:29,199 --> 01:14:31,190
and nothing else?

752
01:14:34,438 --> 01:14:37,805
- Just do what you want.
- Look at this.

753
01:14:43,480 --> 01:14:46,313
So, I guess he took her
with him?

754
01:14:46,350 --> 01:14:48,250
Fuck!

755
01:14:48,285 --> 01:14:50,219
I didn't know the little fucker
had it in him.

756
01:14:53,757 --> 01:14:56,225
I'm actually
kind of proud of the kid.

757
01:14:56,260 --> 01:14:58,251
Yeah, well, he's gonna
get himself in trouble.

758
01:14:58,295 --> 01:15:00,786
He's right on the verge.

759
01:15:00,831 --> 01:15:03,026
We've gotta find him.

760
01:15:03,066 --> 01:15:05,762
Maybe you should
go get him.

761
01:15:07,004 --> 01:15:08,869
He looks up to you.

762
01:15:25,422 --> 01:15:27,982
Will you still help me
out there?

763
01:15:34,197 --> 01:15:36,461
Francis,

764
01:15:36,500 --> 01:15:38,491
where are we?

765
01:15:42,873 --> 01:15:44,864
We're hiding.

766
01:15:46,910 --> 01:15:49,470
Are you okay?

767
01:15:52,149 --> 01:15:54,674
We should get some help.

768
01:15:55,852 --> 01:15:59,379
Francis,
I need your help.

769
01:15:59,423 --> 01:16:02,415
I can't come near you.

770
01:16:04,795 --> 01:16:08,060
Francis, I can't hear you.
What?

771
01:16:08,098 --> 01:16:10,999
What did you say,
Francis?

772
01:16:11,034 --> 01:16:13,764
You're bleeding.

773
01:16:13,804 --> 01:16:17,763
Francis, you're scaring me.

774
01:16:19,343 --> 01:16:21,937
There's something
I need to tell you.

775
01:16:21,979 --> 01:16:24,243
Please-- please,

776
01:16:24,281 --> 01:16:26,977
just help me get up.

777
01:16:27,017 --> 01:16:29,611
We need to get help.

778
01:16:34,524 --> 01:16:36,992
We're born, not made.

779
01:16:40,097 --> 01:16:43,260
- Not like everybody thinks.
- I don't understand.

780
01:16:43,300 --> 01:16:46,201
Oh Christ,
let me go.

781
01:16:46,236 --> 01:16:47,965
Please, please--

782
01:16:49,373 --> 01:16:51,364
Not like the fucking movies.

783
01:16:51,408 --> 01:16:53,774
Francis, please stop.

784
01:16:53,810 --> 01:16:55,471
You have to go.

785
01:16:55,512 --> 01:16:58,538
Francis, please
don't do this.

786
01:17:27,044 --> 01:17:29,035
Franny.

787
01:17:29,079 --> 01:17:31,707
Franny.

788
01:17:36,887 --> 01:17:39,048
I know.

789
01:17:39,089 --> 01:17:41,319
We all gotta go
through it our first time.

790
01:17:44,194 --> 01:17:46,389
It's just the way
it is, okay?

791
01:17:51,802 --> 01:17:55,568
- I wish Mom and Dad were here.
- It just hurts so bad, David.

792
01:17:55,605 --> 01:17:58,574
I know, I know.

793
01:17:58,608 --> 01:18:01,099
It's just part
of growing up, okay?

794
01:18:03,113 --> 01:18:05,104
It's what we are.

795
01:18:52,729 --> 01:18:55,425
What does it mean
to be happy?

796
01:19:00,070 --> 01:19:02,800
To be content
in the world around you?

797
01:19:17,420 --> 01:19:20,048
Is family the heart
of everything--

798
01:19:24,027 --> 01:19:26,518
even existence?

799
01:19:50,120 --> 01:19:52,418
So what do we do now?

800
01:19:54,224 --> 01:19:56,215
We have to move again.

801
01:19:58,929 --> 01:20:00,920
The twins are packing up
the house.

802
01:20:00,964 --> 01:20:03,023
We're gonna leave
in a few hours.

803
01:20:12,342 --> 01:20:14,435
What about Lenny?

804
01:20:16,146 --> 01:20:18,444
We're gonna have to bring him
out of the box early.

805
01:20:21,585 --> 01:20:23,576
Will he be okay?

806
01:20:24,688 --> 01:20:26,918
You were brought
out of the box early.

807
01:20:29,426 --> 01:20:31,690
I was?

808
01:20:31,728 --> 01:20:33,821
Yeah. See how
you turned out?

809
01:20:37,100 --> 01:20:40,001
- Dave?
- Yeah?

810
01:20:42,439 --> 01:20:44,430
I'm sorry.

811
01:20:46,877 --> 01:20:48,868
So am I, Francis.

812
01:20:55,552 --> 01:20:58,385
- Are you ready?
- Okay.

813
01:21:00,857 --> 01:21:03,485
You guys, I really
hate keeping him like this.

814
01:21:03,526 --> 01:21:04,857
You know it's the way
it's always been.

815
01:21:04,895 --> 01:21:06,385
He would've
killed everything in sight.

816
01:21:06,429 --> 01:21:08,192
- Kind of like us. You ready, David?
- Let me do this.

817
01:21:08,231 --> 01:21:10,165
We're gonna open the door.
We don't have time for this.

818
01:21:10,200 --> 01:21:11,531
- This is Lenny!
- Darlene, come on.

819
01:21:11,568 --> 01:21:14,969
- David, let's go!
- He is-- he is our family!

820
01:21:15,005 --> 01:21:17,030
I can do this.

821
01:21:19,743 --> 01:21:22,041
Okay.

822
01:21:23,546 --> 01:21:25,537
Are you sure?

823
01:21:27,550 --> 01:21:29,541
Fine.

824
01:21:34,424 --> 01:21:36,415
Lenny?

825
01:21:39,562 --> 01:21:41,553
Lenny?

826
01:21:43,700 --> 01:21:45,463
Lenny?

827
01:21:46,469 --> 01:21:49,063
Hey, baby.

828
01:21:54,477 --> 01:21:56,775
Excited?

829
01:21:56,813 --> 01:21:59,043
Hey, baby.

830
01:22:01,551 --> 01:22:03,849
You see?

831
01:23:08,952 --> 01:23:11,580
We live with a disease.

832
01:23:13,490 --> 01:23:17,017
Mom used to say it was
the one thing that kept us close.

833
01:23:18,194 --> 01:23:21,288
I always thought that it was the one
thing that would keep us apart.

834
01:23:22,665 --> 01:23:24,860
But I was wrong,

835
01:23:24,901 --> 01:23:28,803
and everything you thought
you knew about us is wrong.

836
01:23:30,240 --> 01:23:32,868
We live in the houses
next to you,

837
01:23:32,909 --> 01:23:36,003
we work in the stores
you shop at.

838
01:23:36,046 --> 01:23:38,879
Our kids play with your kids.

839
01:23:41,051 --> 01:23:43,952
We're just trying to be
an ordinary family,

840
01:23:43,987 --> 01:23:47,787
trying to figure out
where we fit in in the world.

841
01:23:59,169 --> 01:24:03,162
But we do need blood,
and we need a lot of it...

842
01:24:08,778 --> 01:24:11,770
...preferably fresh
and not frozen.

843
01:24:11,815 --> 01:24:14,181
Howdy.

844
01:24:14,217 --> 01:24:16,481
We're the Thompsons.

845
01:24:17,481 --> 01:24:27,481
