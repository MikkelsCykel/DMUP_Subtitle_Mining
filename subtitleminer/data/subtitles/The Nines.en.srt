1
00:03:34,909 --> 00:03:36,706
You sell crack?

2
00:03:39,347 --> 00:03:40,544
No, it's cool.

3
00:03:40,545 --> 00:03:42,510
I'm only a cop on TV.

4
00:03:42,584 --> 00:03:45,075
How much... right on.

5
00:04:03,371 --> 00:04:05,134
Is this crack?

6
00:04:05,206 --> 00:04:06,605
You know how to do it?

7
00:05:13,141 --> 00:05:14,699
Yes. Yes, hello.

8
00:05:15,977 --> 00:05:18,070
I'm having a medical situation.

9
00:05:20,715 --> 00:05:24,173
Yeah, okay,
I don't have a belly button.

10
00:05:26,621 --> 00:05:32,082
I do not have a belly button
where I should on my belly,

11
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,357
and I'm concerned
because I don't know if that's...

12
00:05:36,798 --> 00:05:40,529
Can a person live
without a belly button?

13
00:05:40,601 --> 00:05:42,967
'Cause if you think about it,
you're born with one...

14
00:05:44,672 --> 00:05:47,835
and if you don't have one
you're unborn,

15
00:05:47,909 --> 00:05:51,436
and it's really hazy
whether you're alive or not.

16
00:05:51,512 --> 00:05:54,811
I guess I'm wondering...

17
00:05:56,117 --> 00:05:57,641
...am I alive?

18
00:06:00,822 --> 00:06:02,346
Or what if I'm God?

19
00:06:04,425 --> 00:06:06,586
I don't think I need an ambulance,

20
00:06:06,661 --> 00:06:08,720
but I should probably
go to the hospital.

21
00:06:09,797 --> 00:06:11,128
Yeah, I should.

22
00:07:04,685 --> 00:07:07,017
Like you've never done worse!

23
00:07:07,088 --> 00:07:09,352
Okay, yes, he totaled a car,

24
00:07:09,424 --> 00:07:11,585
but it was
an environmentally friendly car.

25
00:07:11,659 --> 00:07:13,183
Why doesn't that
get reported?

26
00:07:13,261 --> 00:07:16,753
He was heartbroken, betrayed.

27
00:07:16,831 --> 00:07:20,323
You say you understand,
but you don't... you can't.

28
00:07:20,401 --> 00:07:22,892
You're like a big, giant Vulcan.

29
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:24,699
He's coming.
I'll call you later.

30
00:07:24,772 --> 00:07:29,334
Hi. Margaret.
I work for Lola.

31
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:31,844
- Gary.
- I know.

32
00:07:32,847 --> 00:07:34,405
We need to go out the back.

33
00:07:37,218 --> 00:07:40,085
- Are there reporters out front?
- A few.

34
00:07:40,154 --> 00:07:42,714
Not Hugh Grant level,
more like Robert Downey Jr.

35
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:45,953
When he broke into that family's house
and slept in the kid's bed.

36
00:07:46,027 --> 00:07:48,518
I handled episodes two
through four for Robert,

37
00:07:48,596 --> 00:07:50,894
so this sort of thing
is my specialty.

38
00:07:52,133 --> 00:07:55,591
Okay, just so it's said,
this house is flammable.

39
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:58,104
I didn't mean
to burn down my house.

40
00:07:58,172 --> 00:08:01,403
Yeah, and I didn't mean to eat my way
into a ten-year shame spiral,

41
00:08:01,509 --> 00:08:04,307
but I did, and it's healthier
to acknowledge it.

42
00:08:04,345 --> 00:08:06,370
So, this flammable house

43
00:08:06,447 --> 00:08:09,245
belongs to one of Lola's
other fabulous clients,

44
00:08:09,317 --> 00:08:12,252
who is currently shooting
a pilot in Toronto.

45
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,788
- An actor?
- Writer.

46
00:08:14,856 --> 00:08:19,350
So, for the next six weeks,
su casa es su casa.

47
00:08:19,427 --> 00:08:21,122
I say feel free to wear his clothes.

48
00:08:21,195 --> 00:08:23,755
He'll probably get
a sick thrill out of it.

49
00:08:23,831 --> 00:08:24,889
The gays.

50
00:08:24,966 --> 00:08:26,160
He has dogs.

51
00:08:26,234 --> 00:08:28,168
Yeah, they're away at summer camp.

52
00:08:28,236 --> 00:08:29,635
Now, try the bed.

53
00:08:36,477 --> 00:08:37,944
It's fine.

54
00:08:38,012 --> 00:08:40,640
- Comfortable?
- Sure.

55
00:08:40,715 --> 00:08:46,176
Look, Gary, I know this
has been crazy and stressful.

56
00:08:46,254 --> 00:08:49,280
I want you to feel
safe and comfortable.

57
00:08:49,357 --> 00:08:52,121
- I do.
- I'm a fan of yours, you know.

58
00:08:52,193 --> 00:08:54,093
Your number-one fan!

59
00:08:54,161 --> 00:08:56,095
But if you fuck this up,

60
00:08:56,163 --> 00:08:58,495
I will smash your ankles
with a sledgehammer.

61
00:09:00,401 --> 00:09:03,097
And that wouldn't be comfortable
for either one of us.

62
00:09:05,139 --> 00:09:07,266
Nine dogs ran through the field.

63
00:09:10,077 --> 00:09:11,772
The koala sits in the tree.

64
00:09:15,917 --> 00:09:17,680
It's computer voice-recognition.

65
00:09:17,752 --> 00:09:20,687
The parole system can call
you any time, day or night.

66
00:09:20,755 --> 00:09:22,689
If you don't pick up
within five rings,

67
00:09:22,757 --> 00:09:25,624
the police come
and haul your ass off.

68
00:09:25,693 --> 00:09:27,024
What if I'm not here?

69
00:09:28,129 --> 00:09:30,120
That's why they call it
"house arrest. "

70
00:09:30,197 --> 00:09:32,927
You stay inside your house.

71
00:09:34,335 --> 00:09:36,132
He can take direction,
I promise.

72
00:09:37,438 --> 00:09:39,872
I'll be coming by twice a day
to check up on you.

73
00:09:39,941 --> 00:09:42,000
I should be
the only person coming by...

74
00:09:42,076 --> 00:09:45,068
no pals, no buddies,
no heroin dealers.

75
00:09:45,146 --> 00:09:46,477
I don't do heroin.

76
00:09:46,547 --> 00:09:48,947
Yeah, crack is classy.

77
00:09:49,016 --> 00:09:50,449
And I'm not buying you porn.

78
00:09:50,518 --> 00:09:52,281
There's spray-per-view
on cable.

79
00:09:52,353 --> 00:09:54,446
Great, 'cause I really
wasn't concerned

80
00:09:54,522 --> 00:09:56,922
about my career,
family, or future.

81
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:58,613
I just wanted to jerk off.

82
00:09:58,614 --> 00:10:00,119
Let me see your phone.

83
00:10:04,599 --> 00:10:06,464
Come on, all my numbers
are in there.

84
00:10:06,534 --> 00:10:08,024
Dial ten digits at random.

85
00:10:08,102 --> 00:10:11,196
Whoever answers will be better
than the people on that phone.

86
00:10:11,272 --> 00:10:13,934
You have my cell number,
you have delivery menus.

87
00:10:14,008 --> 00:10:15,839
You're fine, right?

88
00:10:18,646 --> 00:10:19,874
Bad idea.

89
00:10:22,249 --> 00:10:23,341
Be good!

90
00:11:33,754 --> 00:11:34,743
Keep it.

91
00:11:37,792 --> 00:11:40,852
Someone was trying
to destroy the evidence.

92
00:11:40,928 --> 00:11:42,418
Someone failed.

93
00:11:43,464 --> 00:11:45,955
Once we get these samples
back to the crime lab...

94
00:11:47,435 --> 00:11:49,369
we'll know
who the real killer is.

95
00:13:07,681 --> 00:13:08,943
Somebody there?

96
00:13:10,751 --> 00:13:11,911
Hello!

97
00:13:28,269 --> 00:13:29,258
Hello?

98
00:13:30,671 --> 00:13:32,002
Yes.

99
00:13:36,477 --> 00:13:38,502
Nine leopards
ran through the jungle.

100
00:13:41,248 --> 00:13:43,341
I bought two cakes
at the store.

101
00:13:47,555 --> 00:13:49,182
The house is haunted.

102
00:13:49,256 --> 00:13:51,451
There's a zeitgeist
or some...

103
00:13:51,525 --> 00:13:53,186
Poltergeist, and no.

104
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:55,728
Maybe they were rats.
L.A.'s teeming with rats.

105
00:13:55,796 --> 00:13:57,263
They live in the palm trees.

106
00:13:58,365 --> 00:13:59,491
Maybe.

107
00:14:00,634 --> 00:14:03,125
Okay, you know,
I'm a licensed psychotherapist.

108
00:14:03,204 --> 00:14:04,694
Really?

109
00:14:04,772 --> 00:14:06,967
No, I'm a publicist.

110
00:14:07,041 --> 00:14:09,032
My job is what
other people think of you,

111
00:14:09,109 --> 00:14:12,078
not what you think of yourself,
so pull your shit together.

112
00:14:12,146 --> 00:14:13,477
I am this close to getting

113
00:14:13,547 --> 00:14:15,879
Christine Walsh to do
your piece in "Parade".

114
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:18,282
"Parade"? I fucking hate "Parade".

115
00:14:18,352 --> 00:14:19,717
Everybody hates "Parade",

116
00:14:19,787 --> 00:14:23,382
but the people that watch Crime Lab
love their Marilyn Vos Savant.

117
00:14:23,457 --> 00:14:26,893
One heartfelt act of contrition,
and maybe the show writer

118
00:14:26,961 --> 00:14:29,486
won't kill off your character
between seasons.

119
00:14:29,563 --> 00:14:31,895
I swear to God,
if you go bat-shit on me...

120
00:14:31,966 --> 00:14:33,194
I'm not crazy.

121
00:14:34,201 --> 00:14:36,260
Exactly. Exactly.

122
00:14:57,057 --> 00:14:59,457
Sorry! I'm sorry.

123
00:15:00,494 --> 00:15:02,689
Over here, to your left.

124
00:15:02,763 --> 00:15:04,958
Right. Sorry, right.

125
00:15:05,032 --> 00:15:08,729
I was practicing my putting,
if you can believe that.

126
00:15:08,802 --> 00:15:09,860
Not really.

127
00:15:13,841 --> 00:15:15,934
Okay, maybe I was
just looking for a way

128
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:17,477
to meet my infamous neighbor.

129
00:15:19,013 --> 00:15:21,106
You see, I'm under house arrest too.

130
00:15:21,181 --> 00:15:22,614
What'd you do?

131
00:15:23,751 --> 00:15:25,616
I had sex with my husband.

132
00:15:28,923 --> 00:15:30,481
That's awful.

133
00:15:30,557 --> 00:15:33,185
Nine months later,
I had Jaden.

134
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:34,386
That's her over there.

135
00:15:34,461 --> 00:15:36,326
She's a cutie.

136
00:15:36,397 --> 00:15:38,763
She's sleeping for another...

137
00:15:40,134 --> 00:15:41,032
Seventeen minutes.

138
00:15:41,033 --> 00:15:42,728
She likes to keep to a schedule.

139
00:15:42,803 --> 00:15:44,293
She seems really boring.

140
00:15:44,371 --> 00:15:45,565
She is.

141
00:15:47,508 --> 00:15:48,941
You're rich.

142
00:15:50,077 --> 00:15:52,170
Shouldn't you have
a nanny from Ecuador?

143
00:15:52,246 --> 00:15:53,873
I'm Canadian.

144
00:15:54,882 --> 00:15:56,747
Can't work in the U.S.

145
00:15:56,817 --> 00:16:00,309
Plus, I want to keep
this air of moral superiority

146
00:16:00,421 --> 00:16:02,321
by doing everything myself.

147
00:16:02,356 --> 00:16:03,345
Very Canadian.

148
00:16:03,424 --> 00:16:04,413
Thanks.

149
00:16:09,163 --> 00:16:12,257
Jaden goes down again
around 2:30.

150
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:13,698
Maybe I could stop by?

151
00:16:13,767 --> 00:16:15,496
I'm pretty sure I'll be here.

152
00:16:16,937 --> 00:16:17,995
It's a date.

153
00:16:18,072 --> 00:16:19,437
Is it?

154
00:16:24,311 --> 00:16:27,109
- I'm Sarah, by the way.
- Gary.

155
00:16:28,215 --> 00:16:29,307
Yeah, I know.

156
00:18:29,536 --> 00:18:32,334
"The best of all possible worlds. "

157
00:18:33,907 --> 00:18:35,238
Okay.

158
00:18:35,309 --> 00:18:38,506
Voltaire, Candide.
Are you actually reading it?

159
00:18:39,613 --> 00:18:41,080
I thought I was.

160
00:18:42,082 --> 00:18:44,482
Sorry I bailed.
Jaden had a fever.

161
00:18:44,551 --> 00:18:46,143
How boring of her.

162
00:18:47,121 --> 00:18:48,486
Housewarming gift!

163
00:18:49,523 --> 00:18:50,785
Demon liquor.

164
00:18:50,858 --> 00:18:52,825
And the best part is I can drink it.

165
00:18:52,826 --> 00:18:54,191
I pumped before I came.

166
00:18:54,261 --> 00:18:55,660
So did I.

167
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:58,561
It's hard to prove
that I was only trying

168
00:18:58,665 --> 00:19:01,190
to burn my ex-girlfriend's stuff
and not the entire house.

169
00:19:01,235 --> 00:19:03,260
Yeah, fire's tricky that way.

170
00:19:03,337 --> 00:19:05,635
Yeah. How 'bout you?

171
00:19:05,706 --> 00:19:07,674
Any history of arson?

172
00:19:08,675 --> 00:19:10,040
Strangely enough...

173
00:19:11,678 --> 00:19:13,839
I knew it. I could see
that little spark.

174
00:19:13,914 --> 00:19:16,314
Well, it wasn't arson, probably.

175
00:19:18,685 --> 00:19:21,245
When I was a little girl,
our house caught on fire.

176
00:19:21,321 --> 00:19:22,549
Oh, shit.

177
00:19:22,623 --> 00:19:25,183
I'll never forget the look
on my father's face

178
00:19:25,259 --> 00:19:27,318
as he gathered me up
in his arms and raced

179
00:19:27,394 --> 00:19:30,329
through the burning building
out onto the pavement.

180
00:19:31,465 --> 00:19:33,729
I stood there,
shivering in my pajamas,

181
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:36,928
and watched the whole world
go up in flames.

182
00:19:38,372 --> 00:19:41,808
And when it was over,
I said to myself,

183
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:45,868
"Is that all there is to a fire?"

184
00:19:45,946 --> 00:19:48,608
Is that all there is?

185
00:19:49,716 --> 00:19:56,217
Is that all there is?

186
00:19:57,224 --> 00:20:00,955
If that's all there is, my friends

187
00:20:01,028 --> 00:20:05,226
Then let's keep dancing

188
00:20:05,299 --> 00:20:08,029
Let's break out the booze

189
00:20:08,101 --> 00:20:11,229
And have a ball

190
00:20:13,307 --> 00:20:20,475
If that's all there is

191
00:20:21,648 --> 00:20:24,947
And then I met
the most wonderful boy in the world.

192
00:20:25,018 --> 00:20:27,782
We would take long walks
by the river.

193
00:20:27,854 --> 00:20:30,584
We'd sit for hours
gazing into each other's eyes.

194
00:20:30,657 --> 00:20:32,716
We were so very much in love.

195
00:20:33,727 --> 00:20:36,218
And then one day he went away,

196
00:20:36,296 --> 00:20:39,356
and I thought I'd die, but I didn't.

197
00:20:39,433 --> 00:20:43,233
And when I didn't, I said to myself,

198
00:20:43,303 --> 00:20:47,171
"Is that all there is to love?"

199
00:20:50,077 --> 00:20:53,843
Is that all there is

200
00:20:53,981 --> 00:20:57,382
Is that all there is

201
00:20:57,451 --> 00:21:00,943
If that's all there is, my friends

202
00:21:01,054 --> 00:21:03,022
Then let's keep...

203
00:21:03,991 --> 00:21:05,390
I know what you're thinking.

204
00:21:05,459 --> 00:21:09,520
If that's the way she feels about it,
why doesn't she just end it all?

205
00:21:09,596 --> 00:21:11,063
Oh, no.

206
00:21:11,131 --> 00:21:15,397
I'm in no hurry
for that final disappointment.

207
00:21:15,469 --> 00:21:19,929
I know as sure as I'm
standing here talking to you,

208
00:21:20,007 --> 00:21:21,804
that when
that final moment comes

209
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:24,002
and I'm breathing my last breath,

210
00:21:24,077 --> 00:21:26,978
I'll be saying to myself...

211
00:21:27,047 --> 00:21:30,505
Is that all there is

212
00:21:30,651 --> 00:21:33,484
Is that all there is

213
00:21:34,621 --> 00:21:38,318
If that's all there is, my friends

214
00:21:38,392 --> 00:21:41,850
Then let's keep dancing

215
00:21:41,928 --> 00:21:48,265
Let's break out the
booze and have a ball

216
00:21:50,237 --> 00:21:53,070
If that's all...

217
00:21:54,641 --> 00:21:57,667
- I need to go.
- What?

218
00:21:59,246 --> 00:22:00,543
Sorry, sorry.

219
00:22:00,614 --> 00:22:01,876
Where are my shoes?

220
00:22:01,948 --> 00:22:03,609
- Wait, just...
- Sorry.

221
00:22:03,684 --> 00:22:05,652
Don't worry about it. Just...

222
00:22:05,719 --> 00:22:08,279
I should go. Good-bye.

223
00:22:08,355 --> 00:22:09,413
You coming back?

224
00:23:04,077 --> 00:23:07,410
And if that mockingbird won't sing

225
00:23:07,481 --> 00:23:11,577
Mama's gonna buy you
a diamond ring

226
00:23:11,651 --> 00:23:14,814
And if that cart and bull fall down

227
00:23:14,888 --> 00:23:19,348
You'll still be the sweetest
little baby in town

228
00:23:19,426 --> 00:23:20,859
Good night, sweetheart.

229
00:23:20,927 --> 00:23:21,951
Good night.

230
00:23:25,132 --> 00:23:27,566
The cat says, "Meow. "

231
00:23:27,634 --> 00:23:29,829
The pig says, "Oink. "

232
00:23:29,903 --> 00:23:32,963
The cow says, "Moo. "

233
00:23:33,106 --> 00:23:36,007
The cow says, "Moo. "

234
00:23:36,143 --> 00:23:39,010
The cow says, "Moo. "

235
00:23:39,079 --> 00:23:41,513
The dog says, "Nine.

236
00:23:41,581 --> 00:23:46,177
Nine, nine, nine, nine. "

237
00:23:48,889 --> 00:23:49,878
Hello?

238
00:23:51,191 --> 00:23:52,351
Yes.

239
00:23:55,462 --> 00:23:57,760
Two trains run through the forest.

240
00:24:04,004 --> 00:24:08,941
Nine, nine, nine, nine, nine...

241
00:24:55,288 --> 00:24:56,653
Fuck.

242
00:25:02,329 --> 00:25:04,729
Jesus, you scared
the shit out of me.

243
00:25:09,503 --> 00:25:12,597
What... I don't... I'm sorry.

244
00:25:12,672 --> 00:25:14,572
Oh, no, I'm...

245
00:25:15,742 --> 00:25:17,869
I'm fine. I'll be fine, yeah.

246
00:25:20,714 --> 00:25:22,477
Where are your parents?

247
00:25:25,318 --> 00:25:26,785
No, no, no, your mom and dad.

248
00:25:26,786 --> 00:25:28,151
Where's your mom and dad?

249
00:25:31,157 --> 00:25:32,886
I don't know what you're saying.

250
00:25:32,959 --> 00:25:35,450
Look, hey, look,
I don't speak that,

251
00:25:35,529 --> 00:25:40,228
so just go back
to wherever you came from.

252
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:42,962
You shouldn't be out here.
No, no, no. Go...

253
00:25:43,036 --> 00:25:44,713
It's not safe for you to be out here.

254
00:25:44,714 --> 00:25:45,937
You should go back, okay?

255
00:25:53,613 --> 00:25:54,841
Oh, shit.

256
00:26:05,225 --> 00:26:07,193
Evening, Officers.

257
00:26:12,332 --> 00:26:16,769
Once again, house arrest means
you stay inside your house.

258
00:26:16,836 --> 00:26:19,432
Think of it like
an electronic leash.

259
00:26:20,507 --> 00:26:23,499
If you even go more than
100 feet from the base station,

260
00:26:23,577 --> 00:26:25,772
the cops come,
and they throw your ass in jail.

261
00:26:25,845 --> 00:26:27,938
If you ever try to take it off,
the cops come,

262
00:26:28,014 --> 00:26:29,538
and they throw your ass in jail.

263
00:26:29,616 --> 00:26:32,414
If they ever detect drugs
or alcohol in your system...

264
00:26:32,485 --> 00:26:34,885
Cops come.
Throw my ass in jail.

265
00:26:34,955 --> 00:26:37,947
No, I kick your ass.

266
00:26:38,024 --> 00:26:40,185
Then the cops come
and throw your ass in jail.

267
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:41,852
Do I still have to answer the phone?

268
00:26:41,928 --> 00:26:44,692
I'll be doing that from now on.
I'm moving into the guest room.

269
00:26:44,764 --> 00:26:46,197
I don't need a babysitter.

270
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,395
Despite all evidence
to the contrary.

271
00:26:49,469 --> 00:26:51,369
Don't worry,
I'm a cool roomie.

272
00:26:51,438 --> 00:26:54,464
Who do you think taught
Affleck how to gamble?

273
00:27:00,213 --> 00:27:02,875
Let's never hear that again!

274
00:27:02,949 --> 00:27:07,318
...ninety-seven,
ninety-eight, ninety-nine.

275
00:27:07,387 --> 00:27:09,184
One hundred feet.

276
00:27:11,725 --> 00:27:14,193
Behold, the edge of your world.

277
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:16,285
In the world,
out of the world.

278
00:27:16,429 --> 00:27:18,056
In the world,
out of the world...

279
00:27:20,533 --> 00:27:21,932
Hey, I'm dancing!

280
00:27:26,272 --> 00:27:28,001
Sure, absolutely.

281
00:27:28,074 --> 00:27:30,634
So the guy's like,
"Do you know fencing?"

282
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:33,178
And I say, "That's what it says
on my headshot. "

283
00:27:33,246 --> 00:27:35,908
- Lies.
- Oh, always. Always.

284
00:27:35,982 --> 00:27:38,917
So he says to me,
"Foil or epi?"

285
00:27:38,985 --> 00:27:41,419
- Epee!
- And I say I'm about equal in both...

286
00:27:41,488 --> 00:27:42,978
- Which is true!
- Exactly.

287
00:27:43,056 --> 00:27:46,492
Anyway, he throws me
this fucking Conan sword, right?

288
00:27:47,527 --> 00:27:51,190
And then he just starts
going after me.

289
00:27:51,264 --> 00:27:52,253
I'm just swinging.

290
00:27:52,332 --> 00:27:54,926
I'm just trying to stay alive,
right, with my eyes closed,

291
00:27:55,001 --> 00:27:57,265
and I end up accidentally
cutting his ear.

292
00:27:57,337 --> 00:27:58,497
You cut off his ear?

293
00:27:58,605 --> 00:28:00,903
Yeah... well, no, no,
just a little, right.

294
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:02,669
But I ended up getting the job.

295
00:28:02,742 --> 00:28:05,074
Wait, you were in
Pirates of the Caribbean?

296
00:28:05,145 --> 00:28:07,045
Yeah. No, no.

297
00:28:07,113 --> 00:28:09,138
No, not the movie, the ride.

298
00:28:09,215 --> 00:28:13,447
I was all, like, "Arr, keep
both hands inside the boat. "

299
00:28:15,388 --> 00:28:17,583
Don't. No finger.

300
00:28:17,657 --> 00:28:19,215
Good night, fuckface.

301
00:28:19,292 --> 00:28:20,816
Good night, you filthy whore.

302
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,992
It's incredible.

303
00:28:29,069 --> 00:28:33,563
Whenever I see them,
I always feel like... damn.

304
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,232
I was born at the wrong time.

305
00:28:35,308 --> 00:28:37,071
Exactly.

306
00:29:14,214 --> 00:29:16,705
- Where's the warden?
- Groceries.

307
00:29:16,783 --> 00:29:18,341
Quite the little missus.

308
00:29:21,154 --> 00:29:23,418
- How's Jaden?
- Boring.

309
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:25,337
We haven't had nearly the grand old time

310
00:29:25,338 --> 00:29:26,584
you two have been having.

311
00:29:26,659 --> 00:29:27,785
You've been watching.

312
00:29:27,861 --> 00:29:30,125
Well, I don't want
to meddle in your affairs.

313
00:29:30,196 --> 00:29:31,390
My affairs?

314
00:29:31,464 --> 00:29:33,329
Everyone needs affection.
I get it.

315
00:29:33,399 --> 00:29:36,027
I don't. Are you seriously jealous?

316
00:29:36,102 --> 00:29:39,162
The opposite.
I just want to protect her.

317
00:29:39,239 --> 00:29:42,208
- From what?
- From you.

318
00:29:42,275 --> 00:29:43,096
Look at you.

319
00:29:43,097 --> 00:29:46,177
You date models,actresses,
tennis players.

320
00:29:46,246 --> 00:29:47,235
Yeah?

321
00:29:47,313 --> 00:29:50,544
On a scale of one to ten,
you belong with the nines.

322
00:29:50,617 --> 00:29:52,744
We both know
you won't settle for less.

323
00:30:02,395 --> 00:30:03,589
What are the nines?

324
00:30:03,663 --> 00:30:04,925
What?

325
00:30:04,998 --> 00:30:06,329
"Look for the nines"?

326
00:30:09,135 --> 00:30:10,466
It's not mine.

327
00:30:10,537 --> 00:30:13,506
- It's your handwriting.
- I didn't write it.

328
00:30:13,573 --> 00:30:14,870
Okay.

329
00:30:28,488 --> 00:30:29,921
Allee-allee-all come free.

330
00:30:32,091 --> 00:30:33,080
What?

331
00:30:34,694 --> 00:30:35,854
Nothing.

332
00:30:35,929 --> 00:30:37,624
Seriously. What?

333
00:30:38,631 --> 00:30:41,191
Nothing. I thought you were...

334
00:30:42,468 --> 00:30:46,302
Forget it. Done. Sorry.

335
00:31:05,225 --> 00:31:08,456
Hiya. Hi.

336
00:31:08,528 --> 00:31:09,552
What?

337
00:31:10,697 --> 00:31:12,460
I have to take this.

338
00:31:12,532 --> 00:31:14,056
Who thought
it was a good idea

339
00:31:14,133 --> 00:31:16,101
to let Courtney
into a pottery shop?

340
00:32:04,417 --> 00:32:05,782
I know who you are.

341
00:32:09,088 --> 00:32:11,682
- Really.
- I know what you are.

342
00:32:11,758 --> 00:32:13,157
If you come near him again...

343
00:32:13,226 --> 00:32:14,523
You'll what?

344
00:32:16,162 --> 00:32:17,629
What are you gonna do about it?

345
00:32:20,233 --> 00:32:22,428
Sorry, what's he calling you?

346
00:32:22,502 --> 00:32:23,696
Margaret.

347
00:32:23,770 --> 00:32:27,069
I like that. Margaret. Classic.

348
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:29,472
- Why don't you leave him alone?
- Alone?

349
00:32:29,542 --> 00:32:32,170
He can't be left alone.
He's an actor.

350
00:32:32,245 --> 00:32:35,703
If no one's watching him,
he doesn't really exist.

351
00:32:36,749 --> 00:32:38,444
And for the record...

352
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:42,683
I'm not the one deceiving him.

353
00:32:43,756 --> 00:32:45,383
He'll figure it out eventually,

354
00:32:45,458 --> 00:32:48,018
and when he does, who do you
think he's going to blame?

355
00:33:06,646 --> 00:33:08,136
Good night, rat face.

356
00:33:09,148 --> 00:33:10,206
Good night.

357
00:33:55,261 --> 00:33:56,387
Hey, neighbor.

358
00:33:58,264 --> 00:34:01,700
Sorry for the psychotic episode.

359
00:34:01,801 --> 00:34:03,029
Okay.

360
00:34:04,003 --> 00:34:05,027
Are you okay?

361
00:34:05,104 --> 00:34:07,698
You look a little Beautiful Mind-ish.

362
00:34:09,876 --> 00:34:12,606
How many times should
the number nine come up?

363
00:34:13,813 --> 00:34:15,041
Probablistically?

364
00:34:15,114 --> 00:34:17,344
"Probablistically"?

365
00:34:17,417 --> 00:34:20,045
You know what I mean.

366
00:34:20,119 --> 00:34:22,246
One time out of ten.

367
00:34:22,321 --> 00:34:24,289
How about every time?

368
00:34:26,025 --> 00:34:28,926
But they only show up
when you look for them.

369
00:34:28,995 --> 00:34:32,089
Looking for them changes things.

370
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:37,592
Some of these are prices,
and there's gonna be a lot of nines.

371
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:39,968
There's something wrong.

372
00:34:41,441 --> 00:34:43,534
There's something wrong
with the world.

373
00:34:47,613 --> 00:34:51,344
I can get you out of here,
but you have to trust me.

374
00:34:52,385 --> 00:34:56,344
Good morning.
Everything okay?

375
00:34:57,457 --> 00:34:58,651
Peachy.

376
00:34:58,758 --> 00:35:00,817
Peachy's good.
I like peaches.

377
00:35:02,995 --> 00:35:04,724
You want coffee?

378
00:35:04,797 --> 00:35:06,355
Yeah.

379
00:35:15,441 --> 00:35:17,306
What do I do?

380
00:35:18,377 --> 00:35:20,174
Do you trust me?

381
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:39,554
You okay?

382
00:35:39,632 --> 00:35:40,929
No.

383
00:35:42,768 --> 00:35:44,258
Tell me about the nines.

384
00:35:44,337 --> 00:35:46,271
The nines?

385
00:35:46,439 --> 00:35:47,770
The nines.

386
00:35:49,142 --> 00:35:50,769
It's sort of hard to start there.

387
00:35:50,843 --> 00:35:55,007
Try, and don't tell me
I'm imagining it,

388
00:35:55,081 --> 00:35:58,278
'cause they're showing up everywhere,
and I want to know why.

389
00:35:59,485 --> 00:36:00,747
Best guess?

390
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:05,519
They're your subconscious
trying to remind you who you are.

391
00:36:08,995 --> 00:36:10,690
I'm a nine?

392
00:36:10,763 --> 00:36:12,128
Yes.

393
00:36:12,198 --> 00:36:14,962
Doesn't make much sense
out of context.

394
00:36:16,502 --> 00:36:18,868
You're not gonna
understand this yet, but...

395
00:36:19,972 --> 00:36:22,770
we've known each other
for, like, 25 years.

396
00:36:24,177 --> 00:36:26,475
One day when I was 12,

397
00:36:26,546 --> 00:36:28,776
you called me out of the blue

398
00:36:28,848 --> 00:36:31,476
and we've been talking
ever since.

399
00:36:31,551 --> 00:36:33,576
Talking.

400
00:36:33,653 --> 00:36:36,144
On the phone, usually.

401
00:36:36,222 --> 00:36:38,349
I never met you
before I came here.

402
00:36:40,693 --> 00:36:43,457
You, Gary, never met me, no,

403
00:36:43,529 --> 00:36:46,521
but you're not always...

404
00:36:47,667 --> 00:36:50,227
I can understand
why you're a little confused.

405
00:36:50,303 --> 00:36:51,770
No, no.

406
00:36:52,772 --> 00:36:55,570
I'm a lot confused.

407
00:37:08,955 --> 00:37:10,081
Theories?

408
00:37:11,090 --> 00:37:13,558
- This is all a dream?
- No.

409
00:37:16,262 --> 00:37:19,288
- I'm in a coma?
- No.

410
00:37:21,934 --> 00:37:24,334
Then I'm dead?

411
00:37:24,403 --> 00:37:28,169
This is hell or a purgatorium
or something?

412
00:37:28,241 --> 00:37:31,608
Okay, purgatorium
is where Romans vomited,

413
00:37:31,677 --> 00:37:36,842
but no, this is as real
as anything can be.

414
00:37:36,916 --> 00:37:38,611
What does that mean?

415
00:37:38,684 --> 00:37:41,152
Everything is what it is,

416
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:44,018
but you're not
who you think you are.

417
00:37:46,125 --> 00:37:49,822
God, no, Gary, please don't.

418
00:37:49,895 --> 00:37:52,125
You can't trust her.
She's a nine.

419
00:37:52,198 --> 00:37:54,462
You don't know
what you're doing.

420
00:37:54,533 --> 00:37:57,900
Okay, so what happens
if I cross this line?

421
00:37:57,970 --> 00:38:00,666
I don't know,
but it's not good.

422
00:38:13,586 --> 00:38:14,678
Shit.

423
00:38:30,436 --> 00:38:32,404
Previously on
Behind the Screen...

424
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:36,600
Gavin Taylor is one
of the best TV writers out there.

425
00:38:36,676 --> 00:38:39,236
Every network would kill
to work with him.

426
00:38:39,312 --> 00:38:41,212
- Good to see you!
- You look wonderful.

427
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,363
My name's Gavin Taylor.

428
00:38:42,364 --> 00:38:44,010
I'm a film and television writer.

429
00:38:44,083 --> 00:38:46,210
"Knowing" is a one-hour drama

430
00:38:46,285 --> 00:38:48,412
about a woman
whose husband disappears.

431
00:38:48,487 --> 00:38:51,217
She believes that her daughter
is the key to a dark conspiracy.

432
00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:54,157
Even way back into "The Fugitive",
where they didn't have

433
00:38:54,226 --> 00:38:56,922
the full setup
and the payoff in each episode.

434
00:38:56,996 --> 00:38:59,590
Knowing is not
gonna be Crime Lab,

435
00:38:59,699 --> 00:39:03,157
not the popular kind of
mystery shows that are out there

436
00:39:03,202 --> 00:39:04,794
where we get all the answers.

437
00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:06,838
...trying to figure out how long

438
00:39:06,906 --> 00:39:09,067
is the attention span
of today's audience.

439
00:39:09,141 --> 00:39:10,233
So, boil it down for me.

440
00:39:10,309 --> 00:39:14,336
Give me one line that we
can really set Roger on fire with.

441
00:39:14,413 --> 00:39:18,076
Basically, it's like
"Rosemary's Toddler".

442
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:23,945
My favorite movie.
That's my favorite film.

443
00:39:26,892 --> 00:39:28,621
We sold it in the room.

444
00:39:29,362 --> 00:39:31,193
Just tell me Roger
liked the script.

445
00:39:31,263 --> 00:39:32,491
You're shooting a pilot.

446
00:39:32,565 --> 00:39:35,625
Melissa McCarthy is my first
and only choice for the lead.

447
00:39:35,701 --> 00:39:38,101
...writing a show
for you. For you.

448
00:39:39,238 --> 00:39:40,762
- Really?
- Yes.

449
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:43,638
Gavin and I have been
friends forever.

450
00:39:43,709 --> 00:39:46,177
It's delightful to be working
on "Knowing",

451
00:39:46,245 --> 00:39:48,179
and it's, you know,
not surprisingly,

452
00:39:48,247 --> 00:39:50,511
a fantastic script,
and it's a great cast.

453
00:39:50,583 --> 00:39:52,346
"Gilmore Girls" has been great,

454
00:39:52,418 --> 00:39:54,386
but, you know,
I'm excited to go

455
00:39:54,453 --> 00:39:57,320
and to have something
this great to go into.

456
00:39:57,390 --> 00:39:58,516
I totally trust Gavin.

457
00:39:59,525 --> 00:40:02,892
The only way we can afford
to shoot the pilot is in Canada.

458
00:40:02,962 --> 00:40:05,556
- I can't believe we're shooting it...
- A 15-day shoot versus...

459
00:40:05,631 --> 00:40:07,360
This is not an argument
I'm going to win.

460
00:40:07,433 --> 00:40:10,925
It's really hard to think about
leaving for six weeks.

461
00:40:13,339 --> 00:40:16,001
Puggies.

462
00:40:16,075 --> 00:40:17,201
Action.

463
00:40:40,966 --> 00:40:42,695
Puggies!

464
00:40:45,604 --> 00:40:46,764
Where's your brother?

465
00:40:46,839 --> 00:40:49,364
It's just so weird being back.

466
00:40:49,442 --> 00:40:52,172
It just doesn't feel like
my house anymore.

467
00:41:19,472 --> 00:41:20,496
At this stage,

468
00:41:20,573 --> 00:41:23,474
you have the script that you wrote
and the film that you shot,

469
00:41:23,542 --> 00:41:25,635
but you don't know how
it's gonna come together.

470
00:41:25,711 --> 00:41:27,611
You just know how
you want it to feel.

471
00:41:40,926 --> 00:41:43,986
Understand?
You have to use big girl hands.

472
00:41:44,063 --> 00:41:46,554
You want to see
where we were today?

473
00:41:46,632 --> 00:41:49,328
Okay, hit play. This button.

474
00:41:52,671 --> 00:41:56,107
There's you and there's Daddy.

475
00:41:56,175 --> 00:41:58,575
Oh, a little movie star.

476
00:42:02,715 --> 00:42:05,650
Oh, he'll be back soon.
Don't you worry.

477
00:42:08,854 --> 00:42:10,481
I don't know if we need
the cold open.

478
00:42:11,490 --> 00:42:14,550
I think we want to get
right to the story.

479
00:42:14,627 --> 00:42:17,926
- The story's so strong.
- Excuse me?

480
00:42:17,997 --> 00:42:19,828
Is there any way
we could be more clear

481
00:42:19,899 --> 00:42:21,958
about why Mary's
so freaked out at that moment?

482
00:42:22,034 --> 00:42:27,563
Wow... I think it's
pretty obvious and dramatic.

483
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:29,801
It is, it's dramatic,
but, you know,

484
00:42:29,875 --> 00:42:31,706
that's Roger's
big thing this season,

485
00:42:31,777 --> 00:42:33,642
is never let the audience
be confused.

486
00:42:33,712 --> 00:42:37,409
Oh, my God, that's just
a huge thing to remove.

487
00:42:37,483 --> 00:42:40,145
No, it's just, you know,
let's see it without it.

488
00:42:40,219 --> 00:42:43,552
Humor. You know, life is full
of funny little strange moments.

489
00:42:43,622 --> 00:42:47,080
I'm just wondering if there
could be, like, not a belly laugh...

490
00:42:47,159 --> 00:42:50,094
I invited Susan to see a rough cut
because I trust her taste.

491
00:42:50,162 --> 00:42:54,428
More importantly, I trust her
as a barometer of Roger's taste.

492
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:56,263
...to give the audience a little...

493
00:42:59,138 --> 00:43:00,901
Yeah, I mean...

494
00:43:00,973 --> 00:43:03,635
Unfortunately, in this process,

495
00:43:03,709 --> 00:43:07,270
it comes down to the decision of
one person, and that person's Roger.

496
00:43:07,346 --> 00:43:08,973
I was thinking
we could all go down

497
00:43:09,048 --> 00:43:10,515
to El Cholo for dinner tonight.

498
00:43:11,517 --> 00:43:14,418
How do you feel about
some blue corn enchiladas?

499
00:43:14,486 --> 00:43:16,545
Should we ask Daddy
when he gets back?

500
00:43:19,191 --> 00:43:21,125
He's not coming back.

501
00:43:22,528 --> 00:43:24,359
Okay, stop.

502
00:43:24,430 --> 00:43:27,888
We just need to slip a wild line
for you over the shot of Noelle.

503
00:43:27,967 --> 00:43:28,956
What's the line?

504
00:43:29,034 --> 00:43:31,195
"How could you. "

505
00:43:31,270 --> 00:43:32,999
- How could you.
- How could you.

506
00:43:33,072 --> 00:43:35,472
It sounds like kosher
drug paraphernalia.

507
00:43:35,541 --> 00:43:38,567
"Hey, Schmuley!
Have a hook on the Hookajew. "

508
00:43:38,644 --> 00:43:41,579
I know. It's just
for the test screening.

509
00:43:43,716 --> 00:43:45,741
They really think
people won't get it?

510
00:43:45,818 --> 00:43:47,718
The dumb people might not.

511
00:43:48,754 --> 00:43:51,450
I didn't think we were
making the show for dumb people.

512
00:43:51,523 --> 00:43:53,047
Yeah.

513
00:43:53,125 --> 00:43:54,387
He's not coming back.

514
00:43:56,562 --> 00:43:57,961
How could you?

515
00:43:58,030 --> 00:43:59,657
How could you?!

516
00:44:00,666 --> 00:44:01,826
How could you.

517
00:44:01,967 --> 00:44:03,434
How could you.

518
00:44:04,436 --> 00:44:05,494
How could you...?

519
00:44:05,571 --> 00:44:07,471
- One more.
- How could you?

520
00:44:07,539 --> 00:44:08,528
Cut. Perfect.

521
00:44:08,607 --> 00:44:11,235
- I feel so dirty.
- That's how I like it.

522
00:44:13,345 --> 00:44:14,573
I like that one.

523
00:44:17,983 --> 00:44:20,008
I want to thank you all
very much for coming.

524
00:44:20,085 --> 00:44:21,566
The show is "Knowing".

525
00:44:21,567 --> 00:44:23,418
It's a brand-new pilot.

526
00:44:23,489 --> 00:44:24,892
Here, in this audience today,

527
00:44:24,893 --> 00:44:26,925
you are the very first people to see it,

528
00:44:26,992 --> 00:44:29,256
and after it's over,
I will come back here

529
00:44:29,328 --> 00:44:31,728
and we'll all fill out
a comment card on our thoughts.

530
00:44:31,797 --> 00:44:33,697
That being said,
enjoy the show.

531
00:44:48,213 --> 00:44:50,477
Please take as much time
as you like.

532
00:44:50,549 --> 00:44:52,210
There's no rush
with this whatsoever.

533
00:44:52,284 --> 00:44:56,152
When you are finished, we're gonna
break into two separate groups...

534
00:44:56,221 --> 00:44:58,781
men and women...
and then we'll discuss.

535
00:45:00,325 --> 00:45:03,226
One of the most important things
in any new show

536
00:45:03,295 --> 00:45:05,422
is how you feel
about the characters.

537
00:45:05,497 --> 00:45:06,896
If you like the characters,

538
00:45:06,965 --> 00:45:10,128
you're more likely
to tune in next week.

539
00:45:10,202 --> 00:45:12,102
Let's find out about
these characters.

540
00:45:12,171 --> 00:45:14,036
Show of hands...
how many of you liked

541
00:45:14,106 --> 00:45:15,903
the character of Gabriel?

542
00:45:15,974 --> 00:45:18,670
One, two, three, four, five, six.

543
00:45:18,744 --> 00:45:20,336
How 'bout Mary?

544
00:45:20,412 --> 00:45:23,108
One, two, three, four.

545
00:45:23,182 --> 00:45:24,240
Noelle?

546
00:45:25,718 --> 00:45:27,982
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven.

547
00:45:28,053 --> 00:45:29,179
So, it's everybody.

548
00:45:29,254 --> 00:45:30,312
Sierra?

549
00:45:31,323 --> 00:45:33,848
One, two, three, four.

550
00:45:33,926 --> 00:45:35,723
That's it?

551
00:45:35,794 --> 00:45:38,354
Is there anything confusing
in the storyline

552
00:45:38,430 --> 00:45:40,591
that's not resolved for you?

553
00:45:40,666 --> 00:45:42,725
Look at this guy.
This guy hasn't budged.

554
00:45:42,801 --> 00:45:45,599
His eyes are shut.
That's helpful. Thank you.

555
00:45:45,671 --> 00:45:47,730
I hate it in movies
and TV shows when they

556
00:45:47,806 --> 00:45:50,366
leave the car windows down
when they totally wouldn't.

557
00:45:50,442 --> 00:45:53,070
- So they can see the camera?
- What's the difference.

558
00:45:53,145 --> 00:45:54,407
Want to see the camera?

559
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:56,675
Was this an issue
for anybody else?

560
00:45:56,749 --> 00:45:58,614
One.

561
00:45:58,717 --> 00:46:00,150
Any other confusions?

562
00:46:00,185 --> 00:46:03,621
Yeah. Was the little girl deaf
or was she just mute?

563
00:46:05,390 --> 00:46:08,291
Is the little girl deaf or mute...
is she deaf or mute?

564
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:10,055
I'm saying what would
you say to him?

565
00:46:10,129 --> 00:46:11,562
I'm not saying I don't know.

566
00:46:11,630 --> 00:46:15,464
Come on. We're not signing to her,
she's signing to us.

567
00:46:15,534 --> 00:46:18,162
We're just speaking to her,
and she seems to understand it.

568
00:46:18,237 --> 00:46:20,102
I thought that was quite clear.

569
00:46:20,172 --> 00:46:21,639
That guy's staring at me.

570
00:46:22,975 --> 00:46:24,704
He can't see you.

571
00:46:26,745 --> 00:46:28,610
God, he's staring at me.

572
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:30,773
I just waved,
and he nodded his head.

573
00:46:33,185 --> 00:46:36,279
He can't see you.
Can't see us.

574
00:46:38,357 --> 00:46:40,052
Susan, he's looking right at me.

575
00:46:41,059 --> 00:46:44,051
You didn't raise your hand
to any questions. Any thoughts?

576
00:46:44,129 --> 00:46:46,063
- It's not real.
- What does that mean?

577
00:46:46,131 --> 00:46:47,207
The show's not real.

578
00:46:47,208 --> 00:46:48,929
Why can't you see that? Jesus!

579
00:46:49,001 --> 00:46:50,901
What, are you fucking blind?!

580
00:46:50,969 --> 00:46:53,062
You think you're
above this, don't you?

581
00:46:53,138 --> 00:46:56,164
You are trapped here
with the rest of us, brother.

582
00:46:56,241 --> 00:46:58,334
Get out. Get out!

583
00:46:58,410 --> 00:47:00,344
Oblivio accebit!

584
00:47:08,954 --> 00:47:10,546
Oh, my God.

585
00:47:11,723 --> 00:47:12,951
You okay?

586
00:47:13,025 --> 00:47:14,652
Yeah, but what was that?

587
00:47:16,128 --> 00:47:17,322
Oh, my God.

588
00:47:18,530 --> 00:47:21,658
I don't know.
The guy was crazy, clearly, I just...

589
00:47:21,733 --> 00:47:23,789
I mean, the show's a little bit twisted,

590
00:47:23,790 --> 00:47:25,794
so maybe it flipped something in him.

591
00:47:25,871 --> 00:47:27,395
What did he say?

592
00:47:27,472 --> 00:47:30,441
He said, "Oblivio accebit. "

593
00:47:31,443 --> 00:47:34,674
It's Latin,
"oblivion approaches. "

594
00:47:35,714 --> 00:47:37,045
What does that mean?

595
00:47:37,115 --> 00:47:39,447
Other than the world
is coming to an end?

596
00:47:40,452 --> 00:47:43,319
"Oblivio" can also mean forgetting.

597
00:47:43,388 --> 00:47:44,912
Forgetfulness.

598
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:51,060
But I think that's
what I'm gonna do.

599
00:47:51,129 --> 00:47:52,255
Forget it.

600
00:47:52,331 --> 00:47:54,959
He was a terrible comedian
and his mom ran the Improv.

601
00:47:55,033 --> 00:47:56,159
Oh, my God, Pauly Shore.

602
00:47:56,235 --> 00:47:57,862
You're not helping me at all!

603
00:48:01,874 --> 00:48:04,604
Designer that was killed in Miami
outside of his house.

604
00:48:04,676 --> 00:48:05,802
Gianni Versace!

605
00:48:06,879 --> 00:48:08,312
One word for both of them.

606
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:10,280
Brangelina.

607
00:48:12,251 --> 00:48:14,719
This is a hard one,
and I don't know how to do it.

608
00:48:16,488 --> 00:48:19,013
You're giving...
you and I should switch,

609
00:48:19,091 --> 00:48:21,423
because that's... you're...

610
00:48:25,230 --> 00:48:27,698
...three weeks later.
I remember that.

611
00:48:34,539 --> 00:48:36,871
Did you have a chance
to look at those cards yet?

612
00:48:36,942 --> 00:48:38,705
From the screening?

613
00:48:38,777 --> 00:48:40,574
Pardon me.

614
00:48:41,613 --> 00:48:44,173
- Daddy needs a drink.
- Help yourself then.

615
00:48:44,249 --> 00:48:46,012
Hey, woman! Where's my drink?

616
00:48:46,084 --> 00:48:50,145
I'm-a comin'!
But I still love you most.

617
00:48:50,222 --> 00:48:52,213
People will write things
on those cards

618
00:48:52,291 --> 00:48:54,122
that they won't say
in a focus group.

619
00:48:54,192 --> 00:48:55,784
They get more specific.

620
00:48:55,861 --> 00:48:58,557
Roger says, you know,
forget about the people

621
00:48:58,664 --> 00:49:00,598
who score you
in the twos and threes,

622
00:49:00,632 --> 00:49:02,657
because they're never
gonna like your show.

623
00:49:02,734 --> 00:49:06,568
- Instead, look for the nines.
- The nines.

624
00:49:06,638 --> 00:49:09,368
They're the ones
who think your show is almost

625
00:49:09,441 --> 00:49:11,136
the best thing
they've ever seen.

626
00:49:11,209 --> 00:49:14,178
They get your vision,
they just want it to be better.

627
00:49:14,246 --> 00:49:17,113
Round two is starting
without you!

628
00:49:17,182 --> 00:49:20,151
- You gonna look at those cards?
- Absolutely.

629
00:49:20,218 --> 00:49:21,207
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

630
00:49:41,573 --> 00:49:43,370
Sometimes the numbers
point things out

631
00:49:43,442 --> 00:49:45,333
that you didn't want
to admit to yourself,

632
00:49:45,334 --> 00:49:46,741
and in this case, it's Melissa.

633
00:49:47,746 --> 00:49:49,543
Well, her overall scores were okay,

634
00:49:49,614 --> 00:49:52,606
but if you look at the people
who scored the show the highest,

635
00:49:52,684 --> 00:49:55,653
the one consistent dip
was Melissa.

636
00:49:55,721 --> 00:50:00,124
There's some sort of subtle
undertones of negativity there.

637
00:50:00,192 --> 00:50:03,286
Well, Gavin, the show is testing
very well in the Midwest,

638
00:50:03,362 --> 00:50:05,749
but it's not doing
well in the urban areas,

639
00:50:05,750 --> 00:50:07,594
and it's not doing well with men.

640
00:50:07,666 --> 00:50:09,031
We've got a major problem,

641
00:50:09,101 --> 00:50:11,592
and I really need you
to think about this with me.

642
00:50:12,938 --> 00:50:15,668
It's Melissa, and it's just
what I thought it was gonna be.

643
00:50:15,741 --> 00:50:17,800
If you'd read the cards,
you'd understand.

644
00:50:17,876 --> 00:50:20,367
I read some of the cards,
but I don't believe in that stuff.

645
00:50:20,445 --> 00:50:24,176
I don't believe you can let
these armchair quarterbacks...

646
00:50:24,249 --> 00:50:25,915
They're not connecting to Melissa.

647
00:50:25,916 --> 00:50:27,582
And I love her. She's so strong.

648
00:50:27,652 --> 00:50:29,483
I am with you on the fact
that she is not

649
00:50:29,554 --> 00:50:32,148
your traditional lead
of a network television show.

650
00:50:32,224 --> 00:50:34,192
She doesn't have
a ton to do in the pilot.

651
00:50:34,259 --> 00:50:35,556
There's so much to set it up.

652
00:50:35,627 --> 00:50:37,925
That's one of the challenges
of the premise pilot.

653
00:50:37,996 --> 00:50:41,625
- But the network still likes the show.
- Roger is your biggest cheerleader.

654
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:43,099
Okay, how about above Roger?

655
00:50:43,168 --> 00:50:44,897
Roger's calling the shots on this.

656
00:50:44,970 --> 00:50:47,905
But we all know that Roger
consults with the "higher powers. "

657
00:50:47,973 --> 00:50:49,838
- That is true.
- They tell him what to do.

658
00:50:49,908 --> 00:50:52,399
- I'm wondering if they liked the show.
- They haven't seen it.

659
00:50:52,477 --> 00:50:55,071
They're gonna watch
all of the pilots on Friday.

660
00:50:55,147 --> 00:50:56,512
That's what I'm telling you.

661
00:50:56,581 --> 00:50:59,778
I want to have something
to present to them...

662
00:50:59,885 --> 00:51:01,477
Why are you focusing
on Melissa?

663
00:51:02,921 --> 00:51:04,445
She's our biggest concern.

664
00:51:04,523 --> 00:51:06,423
She's also the biggest star
on the show.

665
00:51:06,491 --> 00:51:08,959
No, no, no.
You are the biggest star.

666
00:51:09,027 --> 00:51:10,619
Roger has a huge deal with you,

667
00:51:10,695 --> 00:51:14,187
and he went along with casting Melissa
when it was against his instinct.

668
00:51:14,266 --> 00:51:15,290
Hooray for Roger.

669
00:51:15,367 --> 00:51:18,165
I don't understand
what you want me to do.

670
00:51:18,236 --> 00:51:19,396
Meet with someone.

671
00:51:20,439 --> 00:51:23,306
- Who?
- Dahlia Salem.

672
00:51:24,309 --> 00:51:25,901
I know you like her.

673
00:51:25,977 --> 00:51:28,343
Oh, God.
Are you kidding me?

674
00:51:28,413 --> 00:51:30,643
The network has
a huge holding deal with her.

675
00:51:30,715 --> 00:51:33,343
Yes, and they put her
in Gatins' pilot.

676
00:51:33,418 --> 00:51:35,943
That's dead.
I mean, it's dying.

677
00:51:36,021 --> 00:51:38,285
But the network,
they love Dahlia,

678
00:51:38,356 --> 00:51:40,483
so if she could just
jump into your show...

679
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:41,821
Just jump over to my show?

680
00:51:41,893 --> 00:51:45,192
There's no such thing...
there's re-shooting the pilot,

681
00:51:45,263 --> 00:51:47,823
and I brought this up
months and months ago.

682
00:51:47,899 --> 00:51:49,833
You guys kept pushing
other people on me,

683
00:51:49,901 --> 00:51:52,495
and I kept saying Melissa,
Melissa, Melissa.

684
00:51:52,571 --> 00:51:55,472
You kept pushing Melissa on us,
and now we have a problem.

685
00:51:55,540 --> 00:51:58,065
You're very lucky
in that Roger will pay for this.

686
00:51:58,143 --> 00:52:01,772
Roger is willing to re-shoot
this entire fucking thing.

687
00:52:03,715 --> 00:52:05,239
Is this really
about Melissa?

688
00:52:07,085 --> 00:52:10,953
This is about getting
your show on the air, right?

689
00:52:11,957 --> 00:52:13,284
I need you to focus on that.

690
00:52:13,285 --> 00:52:15,085
In the end, that's all that matters.

691
00:52:17,295 --> 00:52:19,058
That's my job.

692
00:52:20,132 --> 00:52:21,722
- Hey, hi.
- Hi.

693
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:24,598
- Well, nice to...
- Thank you for doing this.

694
00:52:24,669 --> 00:52:27,297
Absolutely. I've been looking
forward to this, actually.

695
00:52:27,372 --> 00:52:29,704
- I have a question for you.
- Yes?

696
00:52:29,774 --> 00:52:31,503
Is it "Dalia" or "Dahlia"?

697
00:52:31,576 --> 00:52:33,510
Thank you for asking.
It's "Dalia. "

698
00:52:33,578 --> 00:52:34,943
- Dalia. I knew it!
- You did?

699
00:52:35,013 --> 00:52:36,913
I contested this
with someone earlier.

700
00:52:36,982 --> 00:52:38,006
Well, good.

701
00:52:38,083 --> 00:52:40,483
We have the same birthday.
I looked you up on IMDb.

702
00:52:40,552 --> 00:52:43,453
I wanted to see everything you...
yes, we have the same birthday!

703
00:52:43,522 --> 00:52:45,114
Same year, same day,
everything.

704
00:52:45,190 --> 00:52:47,055
- Are you kidding me?
- I'm not kidding you.

705
00:52:47,125 --> 00:52:48,990
- Isn't that cool?
- That's insane.

706
00:52:49,060 --> 00:52:51,358
- November 21st.
- Oh, my God.

707
00:52:51,429 --> 00:52:54,364
So you're completely
and utterly crazy too!

708
00:52:54,432 --> 00:52:57,663
- She works more than me!
- That's the thing that's killing me,

709
00:52:57,736 --> 00:53:00,534
because she gave up
"Gilmore Girls" to do this show.

710
00:53:00,639 --> 00:53:02,106
She's a very strong character,

711
00:53:02,140 --> 00:53:04,267
and I'm attracted
to strong roles.

712
00:53:04,342 --> 00:53:07,038
Yeah, I'm hoping
to fill her out even more,

713
00:53:07,112 --> 00:53:11,378
and obviously collaborate
with the person that's playing her.

714
00:53:11,449 --> 00:53:14,316
I mean, I see why
the network loves her.

715
00:53:14,386 --> 00:53:16,718
She's adorable,
but it's just that in my head,

716
00:53:16,788 --> 00:53:18,847
you know, I wrote
the role for Melissa.

717
00:53:18,924 --> 00:53:22,451
She's one of my best friends,
and I can only imagine it with her.

718
00:53:22,527 --> 00:53:23,926
Could Dahlia do it?

719
00:53:24,930 --> 00:53:27,524
Absolutely. She's terrific.

720
00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:30,227
It could work, I just don't know
if I want it to work.

721
00:53:32,270 --> 00:53:34,431
When I get stressed out,
I play videogames.

722
00:53:34,506 --> 00:53:35,837
It's my therapy.

723
00:53:35,907 --> 00:53:38,637
Can't have them on my computer
at home 'cause I'd never write.

724
00:53:38,710 --> 00:53:41,235
I love these games
that you can kind of...

725
00:53:41,313 --> 00:53:43,008
lose yourself a little bit in them.

726
00:53:43,081 --> 00:53:46,539
I love that it's a different world
that's existing at the same time.

727
00:53:46,618 --> 00:53:48,142
They're better than real life,

728
00:53:48,220 --> 00:53:51,246
because when you get stuck,
you can always hit "reset. "

729
00:53:52,290 --> 00:53:55,282
That's what life needs.
Needs a reset button.

730
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:57,419
I have to let Melissa go.

731
00:53:59,631 --> 00:54:02,122
What happens
if you don't let Melissa go?

732
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:04,134
If I don't let Melissa go?

733
00:54:08,707 --> 00:54:10,538
My world ends, so...

734
00:54:11,543 --> 00:54:13,443
I can't let that happen.

735
00:54:13,511 --> 00:54:16,309
If we're gonna replace Melissa,
I want to hear it from Roger.

736
00:54:16,381 --> 00:54:17,746
Roger's on a plane to London,

737
00:54:17,816 --> 00:54:20,876
but I talked with him before he left,
and he said yes on Dahlia.

738
00:54:20,952 --> 00:54:22,544
What does that mean?

739
00:54:22,621 --> 00:54:24,589
It means yes.

740
00:54:24,656 --> 00:54:26,123
Yes, replace Melissa?

741
00:54:26,191 --> 00:54:30,287
Roger wants your show
on the air starring Dahlia,

742
00:54:30,362 --> 00:54:34,059
and I just got off the phone
with her agents, and they love it,

743
00:54:34,132 --> 00:54:35,622
and she loves, loves you.

744
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:36,689
What about Melissa?

745
00:54:36,768 --> 00:54:39,464
- You want me to call her agents?
- Oh, God, no.

746
00:54:39,537 --> 00:54:41,004
No, I'll tell her.

747
00:54:52,951 --> 00:55:00,187
As long as he needs me

748
00:55:00,292 --> 00:55:03,523
I know where I must be

749
00:55:03,561 --> 00:55:07,964
I am trying to get
my one-woman show together

750
00:55:08,033 --> 00:55:11,161
that I'm trying to squeeze
in between the pilot and the series.

751
00:55:11,236 --> 00:55:12,999
When you add that cry to the voice:

752
00:55:13,071 --> 00:55:15,266
As long as...

753
00:55:18,677 --> 00:55:21,840
I've always been kind of
obsessed with nuns.

754
00:55:21,913 --> 00:55:25,076
You know, they're kind of
like God's fag-hags, so...

755
00:55:25,150 --> 00:55:27,550
I went to private
Catholic schools for 12 years,

756
00:55:27,619 --> 00:55:30,452
so I have a lot of... nuns.

757
00:55:32,023 --> 00:55:35,049
I'm sorry.
I swear, I don't usually...

758
00:55:35,126 --> 00:55:36,354
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

759
00:55:37,562 --> 00:55:39,359
I have to take this. I'm so sorry.

760
00:55:39,431 --> 00:55:42,457
Yeah, I guess we still mean it.

761
00:55:42,534 --> 00:55:43,899
They accepted our offer.

762
00:55:44,903 --> 00:55:46,632
All right, we will call you back.

763
00:55:46,705 --> 00:55:48,502
Thank you. No, no, no, it's good.

764
00:55:48,573 --> 00:55:50,404
I know I sound nervous.
Okay, bye.

765
00:55:52,110 --> 00:55:53,839
I think we just bought a house.

766
00:55:53,912 --> 00:55:55,641
Pretty good.
Pretty good, right?

767
00:55:55,714 --> 00:55:56,703
That's good.

768
00:55:56,781 --> 00:55:58,339
- Right?
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

769
00:55:58,416 --> 00:56:01,180
Go to take a phone call...
we just bought a house!

770
00:56:01,252 --> 00:56:04,483
Well, I think that the show
that Gavin wrote for her

771
00:56:04,556 --> 00:56:06,183
could be a really big deal for her,

772
00:56:06,257 --> 00:56:08,987
'cause she's been more
of a supporting character,

773
00:56:09,060 --> 00:56:11,688
and now she's right in the thick.

774
00:56:11,763 --> 00:56:12,811
So, it's exciting.

775
00:56:12,812 --> 00:56:15,199
She's really excited, a little nervous.

776
00:56:15,266 --> 00:56:18,292
Then you will know

777
00:56:18,370 --> 00:56:21,567
If someone needs you

778
00:56:21,639 --> 00:56:24,870
You love them so

779
00:56:26,244 --> 00:56:28,872
I won't...

780
00:56:30,849 --> 00:56:35,411
Betray his trust

781
00:56:35,487 --> 00:56:40,220
Though people say I must

782
00:56:41,259 --> 00:56:45,753
I've got to stay true to...

783
00:56:47,599 --> 00:56:54,471
As long as he needs me

784
00:57:07,519 --> 00:57:09,714
Then he's like,
"I'm straight, remember?"

785
00:57:09,788 --> 00:57:11,983
Suddenly stricken
with some sort of gay panic.

786
00:57:12,056 --> 00:57:13,614
"I'm your straight husband. "

787
00:57:13,691 --> 00:57:16,819
- You can throw color swatches at me.
- I know. Oh, I will.

788
00:57:16,895 --> 00:57:19,125
I think my house is haunted.

789
00:57:20,131 --> 00:57:22,224
Well, your house is really old.

790
00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:25,098
Ever since I got back,
I just, I feel like there's...

791
00:57:25,170 --> 00:57:27,035
I feel like there's
someone else there,

792
00:57:27,105 --> 00:57:30,336
and then last night,
I thought I heard something,

793
00:57:30,408 --> 00:57:32,035
like, a woman singing.

794
00:57:33,311 --> 00:57:36,838
- What? Like a ghost?
- I guess. I don't know.

795
00:57:36,915 --> 00:57:40,214
Then I saw something.
I actually ran into someone.

796
00:57:40,285 --> 00:57:42,378
I mean, I saw...

797
00:57:44,222 --> 00:57:46,087
Was it the singing ghost?

798
00:57:47,091 --> 00:57:50,219
It was a man.
I think it was me.

799
00:57:51,429 --> 00:57:54,057
What? Your house
is haunted by yourself?

800
00:57:59,971 --> 00:58:02,633
Yeah, I don't, I mean, I'm like...

801
00:58:02,707 --> 00:58:04,641
having a nervous breakdown
or something.

802
00:58:04,709 --> 00:58:06,438
I'm literally so focused
on this show

803
00:58:06,511 --> 00:58:08,809
that I feel like I'm living
inside of the show.

804
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:10,939
I can't tell where
it ends and I begin,

805
00:58:11,015 --> 00:58:13,142
and I'm having
conversations with people,

806
00:58:13,218 --> 00:58:15,812
and I'm ten feet outside
of my body and looking down.

807
00:58:15,887 --> 00:58:18,412
There I am, having
this conversation with somebody,

808
00:58:18,490 --> 00:58:20,958
and I'm just observing it,
you know.

809
00:58:21,993 --> 00:58:24,223
Just, I don't feel good.

810
00:58:26,030 --> 00:58:28,897
You're just stressed, right?

811
00:58:30,702 --> 00:58:33,170
The network wants
to replace you.

812
00:58:33,238 --> 00:58:34,705
Oh, my God.

813
00:58:39,344 --> 00:58:41,209
And I'm letting them,

814
00:58:41,279 --> 00:58:45,113
because I really want
this show on the air.

815
00:58:46,117 --> 00:58:48,142
I have all these characters
inside my head,

816
00:58:48,219 --> 00:58:50,551
and they wanna live,
and I'm the only way...

817
00:58:50,622 --> 00:58:53,352
This is the only way
that they can.

818
00:58:54,359 --> 00:58:57,328
- I have five seasons mapped out.
- Oh, five?

819
00:58:58,329 --> 00:59:00,422
Well, it sucks.

820
00:59:00,532 --> 00:59:02,466
Either you go away
or the show goes,

821
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:04,559
and I had to make a decision,

822
00:59:04,636 --> 00:59:06,627
and that's the decision
that I made.

823
00:59:07,405 --> 00:59:10,568
And I am so sorry.

824
00:59:12,577 --> 00:59:14,374
I understand.

825
00:59:14,445 --> 00:59:18,381
I mean, it's not your fault, right?

826
00:59:18,449 --> 00:59:21,043
I mean, it couldn't be your fault.

827
00:59:21,119 --> 00:59:25,180
You are morally incapable
of doing the right thing.

828
00:59:25,256 --> 00:59:27,053
Right? Don't do that.

829
00:59:28,126 --> 00:59:29,184
Don't get me wrong.

830
00:59:29,260 --> 00:59:30,955
I think you do feel bad for me.

831
00:59:31,029 --> 00:59:33,463
That's all I think you feel for me.

832
00:59:33,531 --> 00:59:35,226
Okay, I am still the fat girl

833
00:59:35,300 --> 00:59:38,235
you call on Friday nights
when your date falls through.

834
00:59:38,303 --> 00:59:40,032
"Hey, let's go see a movie!"

835
00:59:40,104 --> 00:59:42,334
"Let's go to Fubar. "

836
00:59:42,407 --> 00:59:45,001
"Then when I pick up
a hot piece of ass, I'll drop you,

837
00:59:45,076 --> 00:59:47,135
"and that's okay...
don't worry about Melissa.

838
00:59:47,211 --> 00:59:49,805
I mean, you can call her tomorrow
and apologize, or not. "

839
00:59:49,881 --> 00:59:51,786
It doesn't really
matter 'cause we're not

840
00:59:51,787 --> 00:59:53,282
actually friends, are we, Gavin?

841
00:59:53,351 --> 00:59:56,047
- That's just not true.
- Isn't it, really?

842
00:59:56,120 --> 00:59:58,588
I prefer to not do this
on camera, okay?

843
00:59:58,656 --> 01:00:00,715
- Is this not a good idea?
- Please lower your voice.

844
01:00:00,792 --> 01:00:02,919
I'm not gonna lower my voice.
Is that embarrassing?

845
01:00:02,994 --> 01:00:04,427
You can't control this one.

846
01:00:04,495 --> 01:00:06,520
Your little puppets
are off their strings,

847
01:00:06,598 --> 01:00:09,192
running around saying shit
that you didn't write.

848
01:00:09,267 --> 01:00:11,963
Well, this is reality,
and it scares the shit out of you.

849
01:00:12,036 --> 01:00:13,867
Reality scares me?
Does it really?

850
01:00:13,938 --> 01:00:16,907
I'm gonna tell you, you wouldn't
be here if it wasn't for me.

851
01:00:16,975 --> 01:00:19,637
I gave you your first few roles
and your career as a result.

852
01:00:19,711 --> 01:00:21,076
That's reality, Melissa.

853
01:00:21,145 --> 01:00:24,637
Thank you for finally
playing that fucking card,

854
01:00:24,716 --> 01:00:26,809
the "I invented
Melissa McCarthy" card.

855
01:00:26,884 --> 01:00:28,909
I bought a house, Gavin!

856
01:00:28,987 --> 01:00:31,512
I bought a house
'cause of what we talked about.

857
01:00:32,523 --> 01:00:35,253
Fuck you, and don't ever
fucking pity me again.

858
01:00:49,340 --> 01:00:50,466
Cut, please.

859
01:00:52,577 --> 01:00:53,635
Please.

860
01:01:02,453 --> 01:01:04,546
Upfronts is the week each year

861
01:01:04,622 --> 01:01:07,989
when the networks present
their fall schedule to the advertisers.

862
01:01:08,059 --> 01:01:10,027
It's a very important event for us,

863
01:01:10,094 --> 01:01:12,494
and the weeks preceding it
are pretty stressful

864
01:01:12,563 --> 01:01:15,657
because the schedule is a secret
right up until it's announced.

865
01:01:15,733 --> 01:01:17,928
"Upfronts"
is a complete oxymoron

866
01:01:18,002 --> 01:01:21,768
because nobody's
remotely honest, so it's...

867
01:01:21,839 --> 01:01:24,103
It's really a show
for the advertisers

868
01:01:24,175 --> 01:01:27,975
to get them really jazzed up
about the new product for the fall.

869
01:01:28,046 --> 01:01:30,071
"Here's our new shit. Like it?"

870
01:01:30,148 --> 01:01:32,480
There's lots of upsides...
you're in New York.

871
01:01:32,550 --> 01:01:35,212
Any time you're in New York City
is a good time.

872
01:01:37,555 --> 01:01:39,682
So, have you heard from Susan?

873
01:01:39,757 --> 01:01:42,988
No, I've not heard
from Susan as of yet.

874
01:01:43,061 --> 01:01:46,394
I left her four or five messages

875
01:01:46,464 --> 01:01:48,932
telling her what
went down with Melissa,

876
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,468
and that I let her go,
and that I met with Dahlia...

877
01:01:52,637 --> 01:01:54,537
and I've not yet
heard back from her.

878
01:01:55,740 --> 01:01:57,605
I feel bad about
what happened with Melissa,

879
01:01:57,675 --> 01:02:00,075
but it's a two-way street
and I'm a little angry, too.

880
01:02:00,178 --> 01:02:02,271
We've been friends for years.

881
01:02:02,313 --> 01:02:04,838
I think we'll be friends again.

882
01:02:06,451 --> 01:02:08,112
We'll move on.

883
01:02:08,186 --> 01:02:11,087
Ice cold water, ice cold water.

884
01:02:11,155 --> 01:02:13,180
Only one dollar.

885
01:02:13,257 --> 01:02:16,988
I was 12 when we got in this car.

886
01:02:18,763 --> 01:02:21,323
I've not yet heard from Susan.

887
01:02:21,399 --> 01:02:23,799
Got off the plane,
checked messages, nothing.

888
01:02:26,771 --> 01:02:28,500
I suppose that we have a...

889
01:02:29,874 --> 01:02:32,172
I suppose we have
a reciprocal relationship,

890
01:02:32,243 --> 01:02:33,801
my show and your show.

891
01:02:33,878 --> 01:02:36,642
That's the thing
about reality television, isn't it...

892
01:02:36,714 --> 01:02:39,080
the worse it gets for me,
the better it is for you.

893
01:02:42,019 --> 01:02:44,385
It certainly inspires
a newfound sympathy

894
01:02:44,455 --> 01:02:45,683
for my characters.

895
01:02:45,757 --> 01:02:47,452
You know,
I put them through hell.

896
01:02:49,026 --> 01:02:52,325
I kill off their husbands
or throw them off cliffs.

897
01:02:52,396 --> 01:02:54,023
I'm a cruel god...

898
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:58,933
all in the name of a good story
or compelling television.

899
01:03:01,239 --> 01:03:03,434
What's funny is that I'm
a character in your show.

900
01:03:03,508 --> 01:03:05,135
I'm disposable.

901
01:03:05,209 --> 01:03:08,872
Kill off the hero.
No one will see it coming.

902
01:03:10,314 --> 01:03:11,508
I dare you.

903
01:03:16,587 --> 01:03:18,680
I think I'm just tired, you know?

904
01:03:18,756 --> 01:03:19,916
I'm just tired.

905
01:03:26,464 --> 01:03:28,831
It's just so surreal being here.

906
01:03:28,866 --> 01:03:31,199
It's not at all how I imagined.

907
01:03:36,374 --> 01:03:37,705
Hey, you!

908
01:03:37,775 --> 01:03:39,936
Hey, hi!

909
01:03:40,011 --> 01:03:41,706
God, Gavin.

910
01:03:41,779 --> 01:03:43,007
Get in here, get in here!

911
01:03:43,080 --> 01:03:44,570
You're doing your show.

912
01:03:44,649 --> 01:03:45,477
And so are you.

913
01:03:45,478 --> 01:03:47,243
Welcome to reality television.

914
01:03:47,318 --> 01:03:48,444
Did you just get in?

915
01:03:48,519 --> 01:03:49,645
Just now.

916
01:03:49,720 --> 01:03:54,054
This whole last 24 hours
have been surreal.

917
01:03:54,125 --> 01:03:56,150
Right. I just said that. Surreal.

918
01:03:57,461 --> 01:03:59,520
- You're good?
- Yeah, great.

919
01:03:59,630 --> 01:04:00,927
I wanted to call you, and...

920
01:04:00,965 --> 01:04:02,348
Oh, yeah? Call anytime.

921
01:04:02,349 --> 01:04:04,332
Seriously, I don't sleep, so...

922
01:04:04,402 --> 01:04:08,566
I just felt really weird
about what happened.

923
01:04:08,639 --> 01:04:10,539
It's just too bad.

924
01:04:10,608 --> 01:04:11,870
What happened?

925
01:04:11,943 --> 01:04:15,106
So I just bumped
into Dahlia Salem,

926
01:04:15,179 --> 01:04:16,407
star of my show.

927
01:04:19,250 --> 01:04:23,209
She tells me that
Gatins' show got picked up,

928
01:04:23,287 --> 01:04:25,255
so, no, she won't
be starring in my show,

929
01:04:25,323 --> 01:04:27,518
which makes me wonder
if my show even exists.

930
01:04:31,929 --> 01:04:34,989
No, no, I left word for Roger,
and I left word for Susan too.

931
01:04:35,066 --> 01:04:37,296
It's like they dropped off
the face of the Earth.

932
01:04:38,903 --> 01:04:40,871
Just call me
when you know something.

933
01:04:49,814 --> 01:04:51,406
At this moment,
I can't be certain

934
01:04:51,482 --> 01:04:53,973
whether "Knowing" will end up
on the schedule at all.

935
01:04:54,051 --> 01:04:56,611
As far as Gavin's concerned,
the show is on the air.

936
01:04:56,687 --> 01:05:00,020
You don't normally fly to New York
and find out at the last fucking second

937
01:05:00,124 --> 01:05:01,853
that your show's
been pulled off the air.

938
01:05:01,893 --> 01:05:04,794
- Excuse me.
- So what is the situation right now?

939
01:05:04,862 --> 01:05:08,491
I don't know. Right now,
the entire schedule is in flux,

940
01:05:08,566 --> 01:05:11,694
and I get these missives
from Roger and the "higher powers,"

941
01:05:11,769 --> 01:05:14,067
but you're not really sure
what they add up to.

942
01:05:14,672 --> 01:05:15,661
What's up?

943
01:05:15,740 --> 01:05:18,140
They flew you out here anyway, huh?

944
01:05:18,209 --> 01:05:21,474
- Oh, see you... you know!
- No, I mean...

945
01:05:21,545 --> 01:05:23,176
It would've been great if you'd extended

946
01:05:23,177 --> 01:05:24,480
the common courtesy of a call.

947
01:05:24,548 --> 01:05:26,709
Gavin, this is
the television business.

948
01:05:26,784 --> 01:05:29,651
It's like high school.
I don't know what to tell you, man.

949
01:05:29,720 --> 01:05:32,655
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry?

950
01:05:32,723 --> 01:05:34,850
But I'm kind of not.
I want my show on the air,

951
01:05:34,926 --> 01:05:37,156
just like you want
your show on the air.

952
01:05:37,228 --> 01:05:40,356
It was shitty of you to go
behind my back after Dahlia, okay?

953
01:05:40,431 --> 01:05:41,796
That was shitty.

954
01:05:44,502 --> 01:05:47,198
And you fired
Melissa McCarthy without...

955
01:05:47,271 --> 01:05:48,966
you didn't even have a backup.

956
01:05:49,040 --> 01:05:51,167
Why would they pick up
your show without a star?

957
01:05:51,242 --> 01:05:53,972
- The network wanted Dahlia.
- They wanted Dahlia in my show.

958
01:05:54,045 --> 01:05:56,878
We tested before your show.
We tested through the roof.

959
01:05:56,948 --> 01:05:58,321
You should see the numbers.

960
01:05:58,322 --> 01:05:59,542
I'll show them to you.

961
01:06:01,118 --> 01:06:04,781
- Really?
- Yeah. Who's your exec?

962
01:06:04,855 --> 01:06:06,379
Susan Howard.

963
01:06:06,457 --> 01:06:08,755
Susan Howard.
She was there.

964
01:06:08,826 --> 01:06:10,020
Ask her.

965
01:06:10,094 --> 01:06:11,618
She would know.

966
01:06:21,639 --> 01:06:23,402
I'm at the UTA party.

967
01:06:23,474 --> 01:06:25,339
Did you hear
about Ricky's assistant?

968
01:06:25,409 --> 01:06:26,842
She literally shat herself.

969
01:06:26,911 --> 01:06:28,606
- No, I saw it!
- Hey!

970
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:31,145
I'll break your fucking finger!

971
01:06:32,316 --> 01:06:33,578
I'll call you back.

972
01:06:38,889 --> 01:06:41,483
All right, let me explain
why I didn't call you back.

973
01:06:41,559 --> 01:06:43,550
Roger wanted to talk
to you personally.

974
01:06:43,627 --> 01:06:47,256
- Bullshit. Bullshit.
- We're only picking up two dramas.

975
01:06:47,331 --> 01:06:50,789
- The rest is what, reality?
- You can go mid-season.

976
01:06:50,868 --> 01:06:53,496
You can go to hell, okay?

977
01:06:54,138 --> 01:06:55,435
All right.

978
01:06:55,506 --> 01:06:58,168
I've been the only one here
trying to protect you...

979
01:06:58,242 --> 01:07:00,608
Oh, God, don't start!
Protecting me from what?

980
01:07:00,711 --> 01:07:03,373
From you? You're psychotic.
All I wanna know is why.

981
01:07:03,414 --> 01:07:04,711
- You want a motive?
- I do.

982
01:07:04,782 --> 01:07:07,041
This isn't "Crime Lab. "
Nobody got murdered.

983
01:07:07,118 --> 01:07:11,145
My show did. Tell me why.

984
01:07:11,188 --> 01:07:12,683
I had to get you away from her.

985
01:07:12,684 --> 01:07:13,986
She was holding you back.

986
01:07:14,025 --> 01:07:15,515
- You had to give her up.
- Melissa.

987
01:07:15,559 --> 01:07:17,288
If she really mattered so much,

988
01:07:17,328 --> 01:07:19,660
you couldn't have
betrayed her so easily.

989
01:07:19,697 --> 01:07:22,757
Do you manipulate everybody
or am I special?

990
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:24,028
Are you the victim here?

991
01:07:24,068 --> 01:07:26,798
The big creator can't stand up
to one little d-girl?

992
01:07:26,837 --> 01:07:29,499
- It was your choice.
- Give me a break.

993
01:07:29,540 --> 01:07:32,805
I didn't have a choice.
It was either Dahlia or no show.

994
01:07:32,843 --> 01:07:34,868
That was the only thing...
oh, fuck you!

995
01:07:34,912 --> 01:07:36,311
Fuck you!

996
01:07:36,347 --> 01:07:38,747
Your dialogue
used to be a lot sharper.

997
01:07:38,783 --> 01:07:40,614
Maybe Gatins
could give it a polish.

998
01:07:49,693 --> 01:07:51,320
Is that all there is?

999
01:07:53,397 --> 01:07:55,763
You feel like a man?

1000
01:07:55,833 --> 01:07:58,324
Because I'll tell you
a little secret.

1001
01:07:58,402 --> 01:08:00,233
You're not.

1002
01:08:43,247 --> 01:08:45,772
Hey, look, my...
I don't wanna do this anymore.

1003
01:08:45,850 --> 01:08:47,215
My show is not gonna happen,

1004
01:08:47,284 --> 01:08:50,310
so this show's over, done, gone,
good-bye, thank you very much.

1005
01:08:50,387 --> 01:08:52,582
I'm not gonna be
your fuckin' puppet!

1006
01:08:53,924 --> 01:08:56,154
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

1007
01:08:56,227 --> 01:08:57,751
Who you talkin' to?

1008
01:09:20,751 --> 01:09:22,446
Oh, God.

1009
01:09:45,943 --> 01:09:48,673
I can understand
why you're a little confused.

1010
01:09:48,746 --> 01:09:49,974
No, no.

1011
01:09:51,115 --> 01:09:53,242
I'm a lot confused.

1012
01:09:56,053 --> 01:09:57,315
Theories?

1013
01:09:58,455 --> 01:10:00,514
This is all a dream?

1014
01:10:00,591 --> 01:10:01,580
No.

1015
01:10:03,494 --> 01:10:05,462
I'm in a coma?

1016
01:10:05,529 --> 01:10:06,393
No.

1017
01:10:09,667 --> 01:10:11,259
Then I'm dead?

1018
01:10:11,335 --> 01:10:12,893
This is hell

1019
01:10:12,970 --> 01:10:16,098
or a purgatorium or something?

1020
01:10:16,173 --> 01:10:17,504
Okay, purgatorium

1021
01:10:17,575 --> 01:10:19,304
is where Romans vomited,

1022
01:10:19,376 --> 01:10:22,743
but no, this is as real

1023
01:10:22,813 --> 01:10:23,905
as anything can be.

1024
01:10:23,981 --> 01:10:25,812
What does that mean?

1025
01:10:25,883 --> 01:10:28,010
Everything is what it is,

1026
01:10:28,085 --> 01:10:31,543
but you're not who you think you are.

1027
01:10:33,791 --> 01:10:36,521
Okay. Then who am I?

1028
01:10:38,429 --> 01:10:39,828
You are...

1029
01:10:41,832 --> 01:10:44,426
a multi-dimensional being

1030
01:10:44,501 --> 01:10:48,028
of vast, almost infinite power.

1031
01:10:48,105 --> 01:10:51,472
You, this body you're in,

1032
01:10:51,542 --> 01:10:54,636
it's just one of your incarnations,

1033
01:10:54,712 --> 01:10:57,078
avatars, call you what you will.

1034
01:10:58,115 --> 01:11:00,515
Are you saying I'm God?

1035
01:11:00,618 --> 01:11:02,677
Technically, no.

1036
01:11:02,720 --> 01:11:05,086
If God is a ten,

1037
01:11:05,155 --> 01:11:07,453
a theoretical ultimate,

1038
01:11:07,524 --> 01:11:10,049
you're more of a nine.

1039
01:11:12,062 --> 01:11:13,051
What are you?

1040
01:11:14,098 --> 01:11:15,565
Humans are sevens.

1041
01:11:15,633 --> 01:11:17,066
Monkeys are sixes.

1042
01:11:18,535 --> 01:11:20,196
What are the eights?

1043
01:11:20,271 --> 01:11:21,636
Koalas.

1044
01:11:21,705 --> 01:11:22,967
They're telepathic,

1045
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:25,090
plus they control the weather.

1046
01:11:25,125 --> 01:11:27,140
But the important thing is you.

1047
01:11:29,546 --> 01:11:31,411
You created this world on a whim

1048
01:11:31,448 --> 01:11:33,848
and decided to stick around

1049
01:11:33,884 --> 01:11:36,819
to see how it turned out.

1050
01:11:36,854 --> 01:11:38,219
You can destroy the world

1051
01:11:38,255 --> 01:11:39,688
with a single thought.

1052
01:11:39,723 --> 01:11:42,624
Don't, incidentally.

1053
01:11:42,660 --> 01:11:45,220
Just file that away.

1054
01:11:45,262 --> 01:11:48,390
But... the truth is,

1055
01:11:48,432 --> 01:11:50,559
you hold all the cards.

1056
01:11:51,769 --> 01:11:53,031
When people pray,

1057
01:11:53,103 --> 01:11:55,333
they don't want this thing

1058
01:11:55,406 --> 01:11:57,101
or that thing.

1059
01:11:57,174 --> 01:11:59,199
They don't want to be forgotten.

1060
01:12:02,813 --> 01:12:06,715
So... you understand?

1061
01:12:06,784 --> 01:12:09,719
I mean, I would've told you earlier,

1062
01:12:09,787 --> 01:12:10,776
but I didn't...

1063
01:12:10,854 --> 01:12:12,048
Yeah.

1064
01:12:12,122 --> 01:12:13,953
Okay?

1065
01:12:14,024 --> 01:12:15,514
I understand.

1066
01:12:18,862 --> 01:12:21,126
But I don't believe you.

1067
01:12:46,890 --> 01:12:49,757
Noelle, don't get too far ahead.

1068
01:12:53,030 --> 01:12:55,760
No! You had ice cream at lunch.

1069
01:12:57,468 --> 01:13:00,028
Evidently, frozen yogurt
doesn't count.

1070
01:13:00,137 --> 01:13:01,604
I'll make note.

1071
01:13:01,638 --> 01:13:05,506
That's blazing speed
right there!

1072
01:13:08,979 --> 01:13:10,503
Did you hit it?

1073
01:13:10,581 --> 01:13:12,208
Shouldn't have to.

1074
01:13:21,558 --> 01:13:23,992
Honey, I think we left
the overhead light on.

1075
01:13:25,562 --> 01:13:28,588
Battery's dead.
At least the starter is.

1076
01:13:28,665 --> 01:13:31,498
- How do we, uh...?
- We call the service.

1077
01:13:31,568 --> 01:13:32,967
There's not much else we can do.

1078
01:13:33,036 --> 01:13:35,971
Just the little battery, right?
The big one's probably fine.

1079
01:13:36,039 --> 01:13:37,597
I guess.

1080
01:13:37,674 --> 01:13:40,040
We can't jump it
from one battery to another?

1081
01:13:40,110 --> 01:13:41,702
You cross over somehow?

1082
01:13:41,779 --> 01:13:43,838
Who do you think
you married, MacGyver?

1083
01:13:43,914 --> 01:13:46,576
Come on. Hold on.

1084
01:13:51,889 --> 01:13:53,481
- Are you getting a signal?
- No.

1085
01:13:53,557 --> 01:13:54,581
You?

1086
01:13:55,626 --> 01:13:57,218
Yes. One bar.

1087
01:14:04,935 --> 01:14:07,597
Don't worry.
Daddy's calling people to help us.

1088
01:14:07,671 --> 01:14:09,901
Minute you place a call,
the bar goes away.

1089
01:14:09,973 --> 01:14:11,338
Keep trying.

1090
01:14:11,408 --> 01:14:14,639
I'll keep trying, Mary,
but it's gonna keep happening.

1091
01:14:14,711 --> 01:14:16,440
What do you wanna do?

1092
01:14:17,881 --> 01:14:18,905
I don't know.

1093
01:14:21,018 --> 01:14:22,883
Maybe if you hold it up higher.

1094
01:14:30,360 --> 01:14:33,124
Okay, look, the problem is
that we're boxed in.

1095
01:14:33,197 --> 01:14:34,562
It's a canyon.

1096
01:14:34,631 --> 01:14:37,259
Where we came off the main road,
it was more open and higher, too.

1097
01:14:39,169 --> 01:14:42,297
- That's at least a mile.
- I can run that.

1098
01:14:43,574 --> 01:14:44,939
So, what, we stay here?

1099
01:14:48,111 --> 01:14:49,510
You okay with that?

1100
01:14:49,580 --> 01:14:52,515
I don't think we have
much of a choice, so...

1101
01:14:52,583 --> 01:14:55,450
- Yeah. Go.
- Okay.

1102
01:14:56,987 --> 01:14:59,182
Daddy's gonna get
a truck to help us out.

1103
01:14:59,289 --> 01:15:01,780
Take care of Mommy, okay?
All right.

1104
01:15:01,825 --> 01:15:03,122
Be right back.

1105
01:16:10,093 --> 01:16:13,028
Excuse me.

1106
01:16:13,096 --> 01:16:16,065
Hi. Do you have a cell phone?

1107
01:16:17,067 --> 01:16:19,433
Oh, no, I don't.
There's no service up here.

1108
01:16:19,503 --> 01:16:21,437
Yeah, I'm finding that out.

1109
01:16:21,505 --> 01:16:25,635
You can usually get a signal
down at the ranger's station.

1110
01:16:25,709 --> 01:16:28,974
Yeah, you just follow
the road down.

1111
01:16:29,046 --> 01:16:31,014
It's probably... I don't know.
You got a car?

1112
01:16:31,081 --> 01:16:34,448
No, it's dead.
That's why I need a...

1113
01:16:35,452 --> 01:16:37,249
Are you headed
back to your car now?

1114
01:16:37,321 --> 01:16:40,722
If you could give me a ride
to a gas station, wherever?

1115
01:16:44,194 --> 01:16:47,163
Look, I'm not
some crazy Ted Bundy guy.

1116
01:16:47,230 --> 01:16:49,391
I'm not gonna rape
or kill you or anything.

1117
01:16:50,500 --> 01:16:53,799
Which is, of course,
what a Ted Bundy would say.

1118
01:16:55,305 --> 01:16:58,035
Look, I'm a videogame designer.

1119
01:16:58,108 --> 01:17:01,236
My wife is an editor,
my daughter's eight.

1120
01:17:01,345 --> 01:17:03,711
Look, I just... they're waiting
back at the car.

1121
01:17:03,747 --> 01:17:05,339
Just a little help before it gets dark.

1122
01:17:05,415 --> 01:17:07,383
I'll call somebody
when I get back to town.

1123
01:17:07,451 --> 01:17:10,011
I believe you, I do, it's just
you don't know where the car is,

1124
01:17:10,087 --> 01:17:11,213
and the guy might not come.

1125
01:17:11,288 --> 01:17:14,052
- We can't be up here all night, so...
- Sorry.

1126
01:17:14,124 --> 01:17:17,150
- Don't be sorry, just help me out.
- No.

1127
01:17:17,227 --> 01:17:18,387
I can't.

1128
01:17:23,533 --> 01:17:25,330
Why won't you trust me?

1129
01:17:51,128 --> 01:17:53,460
Okay, but you have to be careful.

1130
01:17:53,530 --> 01:17:55,964
Understand? You have
to use big girl hands.

1131
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,093
You want to see
where we were today?

1132
01:17:59,202 --> 01:18:02,103
Okay, hit play. This button.

1133
01:18:05,275 --> 01:18:08,301
There's you and there's Daddy.

1134
01:18:08,378 --> 01:18:10,471
A little movie star.

1135
01:18:15,719 --> 01:18:18,187
He'll be back soon.
Don't you worry.

1136
01:18:31,134 --> 01:18:32,431
Are you following me?

1137
01:18:33,637 --> 01:18:35,901
Since I was sure
you weren't following me.

1138
01:18:35,972 --> 01:18:38,304
I'm sorry, it's just...

1139
01:18:38,375 --> 01:18:41,242
- You thought I was Ted Bundy.
- Kind of.

1140
01:18:42,846 --> 01:18:45,178
My name's Gabriel... Bundy.

1141
01:18:45,248 --> 01:18:46,943
Sierra.

1142
01:18:48,351 --> 01:18:50,342
It's weird
that there's no cars at all.

1143
01:18:50,420 --> 01:18:52,615
Yeah, I'll say.

1144
01:18:52,689 --> 01:18:54,953
Anyway, my car
is parked over there.

1145
01:18:55,025 --> 01:18:57,755
It's not that far,

1146
01:18:57,828 --> 01:19:00,023
and if you want, I could
give you a ride to town.

1147
01:19:00,130 --> 01:19:02,291
That'd be great.
Thank you.

1148
01:19:02,332 --> 01:19:04,800
- Make up some karma.
- Please, lead the way.

1149
01:19:09,539 --> 01:19:10,801
Just a sec.

1150
01:19:16,246 --> 01:19:18,237
Okay, confession.

1151
01:19:18,315 --> 01:19:20,442
I kind of recognized you.

1152
01:19:21,451 --> 01:19:22,440
Really.

1153
01:19:22,519 --> 01:19:24,714
I wasn't sure,
but I think I saw a picture of you

1154
01:19:24,788 --> 01:19:27,188
in my boyfriend's
videogame magazine.

1155
01:19:27,257 --> 01:19:28,815
Right? You're, like, the shit.

1156
01:19:28,892 --> 01:19:29,881
No, no.

1157
01:19:29,960 --> 01:19:32,724
You're like the Quentin Tarantino
of their world,

1158
01:19:32,796 --> 01:19:34,320
videogame god.

1159
01:19:34,397 --> 01:19:36,558
- Not really, no.
- Fine.

1160
01:19:36,633 --> 01:19:39,193
You seriously recognized me
off one photo?

1161
01:19:39,269 --> 01:19:41,703
I thought you were
kind of hot, considering.

1162
01:19:41,772 --> 01:19:42,796
Considering...?

1163
01:19:42,873 --> 01:19:45,398
Within the subset
of videogame people.

1164
01:19:46,710 --> 01:19:49,008
I wasn't masturbating
to your picture or anything.

1165
01:19:49,079 --> 01:19:50,068
I guess I'm flattered.

1166
01:19:50,147 --> 01:19:52,638
You should be.
I'm stingy with compliments.

1167
01:19:52,716 --> 01:19:54,479
Your boyfriend
plays videogames?

1168
01:19:55,485 --> 01:19:58,921
Ex-boyfriend.
And yes, way too many.

1169
01:19:58,989 --> 01:20:02,117
He used to play Evercrack
back in the day,

1170
01:20:02,192 --> 01:20:03,716
but your game was, like,

1171
01:20:03,794 --> 01:20:05,921
I don't know,
what's worse than crack?

1172
01:20:05,996 --> 01:20:07,088
Supercrack?

1173
01:20:07,164 --> 01:20:08,529
He was spending
40 hours a week

1174
01:20:08,598 --> 01:20:10,691
collecting Thunderleaf
or whatever,

1175
01:20:10,767 --> 01:20:14,533
and I was his mule, hauling it around,
'cause he ran out of space.

1176
01:20:14,604 --> 01:20:15,832
You had an account?

1177
01:20:15,906 --> 01:20:17,669
Part of your world,
and you didn't know it.

1178
01:20:17,741 --> 01:20:19,368
I'm sorry.

1179
01:20:19,442 --> 01:20:21,433
You can make it up to me.

1180
01:20:23,013 --> 01:20:24,037
Shit.

1181
01:20:28,819 --> 01:20:30,844
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

1182
01:20:35,258 --> 01:20:38,421
And I am so sorry.

1183
01:20:39,763 --> 01:20:44,598
I understand.
It's not your fault, right?

1184
01:20:45,769 --> 01:20:47,703
It couldn't be your fault.

1185
01:20:48,805 --> 01:20:52,241
You're morally incapable
of doing the right thing.

1186
01:20:52,309 --> 01:20:53,401
- I don't...
- Right?

1187
01:20:54,477 --> 01:20:56,604
So, you play a lot
of characters at once?

1188
01:20:56,680 --> 01:20:59,478
A couple.
Most people do.

1189
01:20:59,583 --> 01:21:01,278
But you're not most people.

1190
01:21:01,318 --> 01:21:04,651
You created the world.
You know all the secret codes.

1191
01:21:04,721 --> 01:21:07,485
- What, like god mode?
- Is that what you call it?

1192
01:21:07,557 --> 01:21:10,424
It's when you have all the powers
and you can't be killed.

1193
01:21:10,493 --> 01:21:12,188
It's actually boring to play, though.

1194
01:21:12,262 --> 01:21:13,991
A game isn't fun
unless there are rules.

1195
01:21:14,064 --> 01:21:15,759
And you make the rules.

1196
01:21:17,467 --> 01:21:18,832
Yeah, I do.

1197
01:21:19,769 --> 01:21:21,236
Thanks.

1198
01:21:23,940 --> 01:21:25,669
Do you think that I'm pretty?

1199
01:21:27,377 --> 01:21:28,366
What?

1200
01:21:28,445 --> 01:21:30,140
Do you think I'm hot...

1201
01:21:30,213 --> 01:21:33,410
on a purely physical level?

1202
01:21:35,385 --> 01:21:36,374
Sure.

1203
01:21:37,387 --> 01:21:38,820
That's a rave.

1204
01:21:38,889 --> 01:21:41,016
Well, I don't know
why you're asking.

1205
01:21:41,091 --> 01:21:44,254
My ex-boyfriend the orc,
used to say,

1206
01:21:44,327 --> 01:21:45,851
"The thing that I like about you

1207
01:21:45,929 --> 01:21:49,126
is you're not so hot
I'm afraid I'm gonna lose you. "

1208
01:21:49,199 --> 01:21:51,258
So where's the orc now?

1209
01:21:51,334 --> 01:21:52,494
He's dead.

1210
01:21:53,904 --> 01:21:57,101
I spiked his water bottle
with a massive quantity of GHB.

1211
01:21:57,173 --> 01:22:01,132
He hallucinated,
went into convulsions, and died.

1212
01:22:03,213 --> 01:22:05,374
Remind me not
to piss you off, Sarah.

1213
01:22:06,383 --> 01:22:07,407
Sierra!

1214
01:22:08,551 --> 01:22:09,779
Sorry.

1215
01:22:12,455 --> 01:22:15,219
What makes you think
you haven't pissed me off already?

1216
01:22:20,430 --> 01:22:21,598
How you doin', kiddo?

1217
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:27,001
I was thinking we could all go
to El Cholo for dinner tonight.

1218
01:22:28,038 --> 01:22:30,563
How do you feel about
some blue corn enchiladas?

1219
01:22:30,640 --> 01:22:32,699
Should we ask Daddy
when he gets back?

1220
01:22:35,111 --> 01:22:36,510
He's not coming back.

1221
01:22:38,982 --> 01:22:40,449
How could you?

1222
01:22:40,583 --> 01:22:42,016
How could you?!

1223
01:22:42,953 --> 01:22:44,011
How could you.

1224
01:22:44,154 --> 01:22:45,246
How could you.

1225
01:22:46,656 --> 01:22:47,816
How could you...?

1226
01:22:48,758 --> 01:22:50,589
- How could you?
- Cut. Perfect.

1227
01:22:50,660 --> 01:22:52,355
I feel so dirty.

1228
01:22:52,429 --> 01:22:53,555
That's how I like it.

1229
01:23:12,549 --> 01:23:13,538
Wait.

1230
01:23:15,251 --> 01:23:16,980
Something's wrong.

1231
01:23:17,053 --> 01:23:18,350
I feel...

1232
01:23:39,142 --> 01:23:40,131
Wait.

1233
01:23:41,411 --> 01:23:44,869
I have a wife and a daughter.
They're waiting for me.

1234
01:23:44,948 --> 01:23:46,415
- Where are they?
- Back at the car.

1235
01:23:46,483 --> 01:23:47,472
Which direction?

1236
01:23:54,257 --> 01:23:56,157
Face it, G, you don't know
where they are.

1237
01:23:56,226 --> 01:23:57,454
You don't know where you are.

1238
01:23:57,527 --> 01:23:59,461
We've been walking
in circles for an hour.

1239
01:23:59,562 --> 01:24:02,895
- Where is your car?
- There is no car.

1240
01:24:02,932 --> 01:24:06,459
It was all a pretense,
an excuse to get you on your own.

1241
01:24:09,973 --> 01:24:11,600
You getting dizzy?

1242
01:24:12,642 --> 01:24:14,303
It's just the GHB in the water.

1243
01:24:16,079 --> 01:24:17,307
What's happening?

1244
01:24:17,881 --> 01:24:19,906
I'm sorry that it had
to come to this, G.

1245
01:24:19,983 --> 01:24:21,848
I promise it's gonna
be over soon.

1246
01:24:23,386 --> 01:24:24,717
You're trying to kill me?

1247
01:24:24,788 --> 01:24:28,349
No, this is not a murder.
It's an intervention.

1248
01:24:28,425 --> 01:24:31,019
Do you feel like a man?
You're not.

1249
01:24:31,094 --> 01:24:33,927
I had to get you away from her.
She was holding you back.

1250
01:24:33,997 --> 01:24:35,487
- You had to give her up.
- Melissa.

1251
01:24:35,565 --> 01:24:38,363
- Allee-allee-all come free!
- There's something wrong...

1252
01:24:38,435 --> 01:24:40,630
I can get you out of here,

1253
01:24:40,703 --> 01:24:42,466
but you have to trust me.

1254
01:24:42,539 --> 01:24:44,370
Do you feel like a man?

1255
01:24:44,441 --> 01:24:47,001
'Cause I'll tell you
a little secret.

1256
01:24:47,077 --> 01:24:48,908
You're not.

1257
01:25:05,662 --> 01:25:07,095
Why are you doing this?

1258
01:25:08,098 --> 01:25:09,690
You did this to yourself.

1259
01:25:10,834 --> 01:25:13,268
And admitting that
is the first step.

1260
01:25:15,038 --> 01:25:18,166
You're a crackhead, G.

1261
01:25:20,710 --> 01:25:24,271
Thing is, this planet
and these people,

1262
01:25:24,347 --> 01:25:26,372
they're your drug of choice.

1263
01:25:28,218 --> 01:25:30,482
It wasn't that hard
to make a universe.

1264
01:25:31,488 --> 01:25:34,685
At first you just checked in
every once in a while...

1265
01:25:34,757 --> 01:25:37,021
...see how the Neanderthals
were doing,

1266
01:25:37,093 --> 01:25:39,994
move a couple
of continents around.

1267
01:25:40,063 --> 01:25:42,531
But then you got
more into it.

1268
01:25:42,599 --> 01:25:45,659
You started playing a couple
of characters of your own.

1269
01:25:46,769 --> 01:25:49,499
Slaves, kings, messiahs.

1270
01:25:49,572 --> 01:25:51,802
Pretty soon you were playing 24/7.

1271
01:25:51,875 --> 01:25:53,206
How long have I been...

1272
01:25:53,276 --> 01:25:56,439
You've been gone
for 4,000 years,

1273
01:25:56,513 --> 01:25:59,038
not that time means
the same for us.

1274
01:26:00,049 --> 01:26:01,880
You came looking for me?

1275
01:26:01,951 --> 01:26:04,511
That's what a girl does.

1276
01:26:04,587 --> 01:26:06,248
Why now?

1277
01:26:06,322 --> 01:26:09,018
Because you forgot
who you were.

1278
01:26:09,092 --> 01:26:11,083
You forgot this wasn't real.

1279
01:26:11,161 --> 01:26:14,221
We couldn't just storm in
on a fiery chariot.

1280
01:26:14,297 --> 01:26:17,289
It was your universe.
We had to play by your rules.

1281
01:26:17,367 --> 01:26:21,201
We had to show you how limited
and corrupt your little world was.

1282
01:26:21,271 --> 01:26:25,298
Don't get me wrong,
it's a nice place.

1283
01:26:26,776 --> 01:26:28,004
It's cozy...

1284
01:26:28,945 --> 01:26:31,539
...but do you remember
where you came from?

1285
01:26:39,489 --> 01:26:42,049
Do you remember
where you came from?

1286
01:26:43,059 --> 01:26:44,492
It was warm.

1287
01:26:47,163 --> 01:26:50,530
And white, like a...

1288
01:26:50,600 --> 01:26:53,194
You can't describe it
with human words.

1289
01:26:53,269 --> 01:26:55,760
You can't think it
with human thoughts.

1290
01:26:55,838 --> 01:26:57,772
We need you to come back.

1291
01:26:59,375 --> 01:27:00,535
With us.

1292
01:27:02,278 --> 01:27:03,609
Come back with me.

1293
01:27:12,488 --> 01:27:15,156
You can destroy the world
with a single thought.

1294
01:27:16,459 --> 01:27:20,691
Don't, incidentally.
Just file that away.

1295
01:27:20,763 --> 01:27:23,926
The truth is you hold all the cards.

1296
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:29,165
When people pray, they
don't want this thing or that thing.

1297
01:27:29,239 --> 01:27:32,003
They just... they don't
want to be forgotten.

1298
01:27:32,075 --> 01:27:34,009
You understand?

1299
01:27:34,077 --> 01:27:35,101
Noelle?

1300
01:27:35,178 --> 01:27:37,271
I would have
told you earlier, but...

1301
01:27:37,347 --> 01:27:38,507
Noelle?!

1302
01:27:47,790 --> 01:27:51,248
Maybe if I just cut back;
didn't get so involved.

1303
01:27:51,327 --> 01:27:53,192
We both know
that'll never work.

1304
01:27:53,263 --> 01:27:55,993
Next week you'll be back here
redesigning the pinecones.

1305
01:27:56,065 --> 01:27:58,932
You have to quit, cold turkey.

1306
01:27:59,035 --> 01:28:00,161
I can't.

1307
01:28:00,203 --> 01:28:03,434
You can,
but I can't force you to leave.

1308
01:28:03,506 --> 01:28:04,734
You have to want it.

1309
01:28:21,891 --> 01:28:23,586
Noelle!

1310
01:28:25,728 --> 01:28:28,925
Come on!
Answer Mama!

1311
01:28:30,300 --> 01:28:31,995
Answer me!

1312
01:28:35,171 --> 01:28:36,399
She's here.

1313
01:28:37,440 --> 01:28:39,931
I didn't forget
about you guys.

1314
01:28:42,945 --> 01:28:44,606
Everything okay?

1315
01:28:45,615 --> 01:28:48,948
Yeah, everything's fine.
Absolutely.

1316
01:28:49,018 --> 01:28:50,542
Let's go home.

1317
01:29:57,019 --> 01:29:58,509
Good night, Jellybean.

1318
01:31:04,353 --> 01:31:06,514
You need to go, don't you?

1319
01:31:07,890 --> 01:31:09,221
No.

1320
01:31:10,259 --> 01:31:11,624
I can stay.

1321
01:31:11,694 --> 01:31:13,889
How long, forever?

1322
01:31:13,963 --> 01:31:17,194
Every day you'd be here,
you'd know what you were missing.

1323
01:31:19,101 --> 01:31:21,365
What happens if you go?

1324
01:31:21,437 --> 01:31:23,962
Worst case scenario?

1325
01:31:28,110 --> 01:31:32,513
Disintegration of everything
into a fiery void, oblivio accebit.

1326
01:31:32,582 --> 01:31:34,379
The end of everything.

1327
01:31:34,450 --> 01:31:36,509
That's all?

1328
01:31:36,586 --> 01:31:38,520
Probably wouldn't happen.

1329
01:31:39,822 --> 01:31:42,620
I guess I'm more worried
about the human factor.

1330
01:31:42,692 --> 01:31:45,286
You guys kill each other a lot.

1331
01:31:45,361 --> 01:31:47,522
In fairness, it's usually in your name.

1332
01:31:47,597 --> 01:31:50,157
Plus, we've gotten
much more efficient at it.

1333
01:31:51,167 --> 01:31:53,101
I like this world.

1334
01:31:55,204 --> 01:31:58,696
I like my life here
with you and Noelle.

1335
01:31:58,808 --> 01:31:59,968
It's not real.

1336
01:32:01,577 --> 01:32:03,101
I'm not really your wife.

1337
01:32:03,179 --> 01:32:05,374
You're not really my husband.

1338
01:32:06,816 --> 01:32:09,148
On some level, it's all pretend.

1339
01:32:12,355 --> 01:32:14,323
How many versions were there?

1340
01:32:15,491 --> 01:32:18,722
Ninety.
This is the last one.

1341
01:32:21,831 --> 01:32:25,699
I've destroyed billions of people
with a thought...

1342
01:32:26,702 --> 01:32:28,897
and you'd like to think
that it's painless.

1343
01:32:28,971 --> 01:32:30,370
Stop.

1344
01:32:32,041 --> 01:32:36,102
You don't have to explain
or apologize.

1345
01:32:37,313 --> 01:32:41,306
Everything that is
is because of you.

1346
01:32:45,121 --> 01:32:49,581
And if that's all there is,
that's enough.

1347
01:32:58,401 --> 01:32:59,698
So.

1348
01:32:59,869 --> 01:33:01,336
So.

1349
01:33:02,638 --> 01:33:05,300
Guess you don't really
need to pack anything.

1350
01:33:07,977 --> 01:33:09,205
I'm good.

1351
01:33:09,278 --> 01:33:10,438
You're great.

1352
01:33:11,948 --> 01:33:16,317
- It has been a pleasure.
- Likewise.

1353
01:33:18,688 --> 01:33:20,383
I love you.

1354
01:33:20,456 --> 01:33:24,324
I love you, too,
you big lug.

1355
01:33:32,034 --> 01:33:33,695
You're my favorite.

1356
01:34:32,662 --> 01:34:34,789
...should we measure it first?

1357
01:34:34,864 --> 01:34:36,855
Got flour, we have flour.

1358
01:34:36,932 --> 01:34:38,490
All right, so I need oil.

1359
01:34:38,567 --> 01:34:39,795
We need nutmeg.

1360
01:34:39,869 --> 01:34:41,700
Honey, do we have nutmeg?

1361
01:34:44,106 --> 01:34:45,300
We should.

1362
01:34:46,676 --> 01:34:48,337
Good. Good, good, good.

1363
01:34:48,411 --> 01:34:50,402
- Nutmeg.
- Cinnamon, too.

1364
01:34:50,479 --> 01:34:53,710
If I had a horse,
I would name her Cinnamon.

1365
01:34:53,783 --> 01:34:55,978
- And if I had another horse...
- Nutmeg?

1366
01:34:56,052 --> 01:34:57,383
No, Flash.

1367
01:34:57,453 --> 01:34:59,444
What? Why Flash?

1368
01:34:59,555 --> 01:35:01,250
I mean, I would name her Flash

1369
01:35:01,290 --> 01:35:03,884
because she'd be
the fastest horse in the world.

1370
01:35:03,959 --> 01:35:05,256
I mean in the whole world.

1371
01:35:05,327 --> 01:35:07,522
- In the whole world?
- Ever whole.

1372
01:35:07,596 --> 01:35:10,190
The ever whole world?
That's pretty good.

1373
01:35:10,266 --> 01:35:11,358
That's pretty fast.

1374
01:35:11,434 --> 01:35:14,403
Yes, and I would be a princess.

1375
01:35:14,470 --> 01:35:15,835
Sweetie?

1376
01:35:19,208 --> 01:35:23,235
This might sound really strange,
but what's my name?

1377
01:35:27,783 --> 01:35:28,807
Mommy.

1378
01:35:29,919 --> 01:35:32,217
Right. Exactly.

1379
01:35:32,288 --> 01:35:34,950
He's not coming back.

1380
01:35:36,492 --> 01:35:38,289
But it's gonna be okay.

1381
01:35:38,360 --> 01:35:41,227
He put all the pieces together.

1382
01:35:41,297 --> 01:35:44,460
- It's like...
- The best of all possible worlds.

1383
01:35:46,836 --> 01:35:49,236
Honey, is it supposed
to stick like this?

1384
01:35:50,573 --> 01:35:53,804
- Better help him.
- Let's go.

1385
01:35:53,876 --> 01:35:56,310
- Do you see what I'm talking about?
- Oh, my gosh.

1386
01:35:56,378 --> 01:35:57,100
...consistency.

1387
01:35:57,101 --> 01:35:59,074
Is it maybe a little... it's too thick.

1388
01:35:59,181 --> 01:36:00,773
We can safely say
that's too thick?

1389
01:36:00,816 --> 01:36:02,807
Will you get some milk?

1390
01:36:02,885 --> 01:36:06,286
- Get milk?
- See, it says milk on the recipe.

1391
01:36:06,355 --> 01:36:07,344
Ready?

1392
01:36:08,357 --> 01:36:10,291
Oh, my. Oh, no!
All right.

1393
01:36:10,359 --> 01:36:12,691
Oh, don't mess it up.
Don't mess it up.

1394
01:36:14,130 --> 01:36:15,358
Thank you.

1395
01:36:15,431 --> 01:36:17,797
Shouldn't we
be using a machine?

1396
01:36:17,867 --> 01:36:20,392
- Isn't there a machine we can...
- I'm the machine!

1397
01:36:20,469 --> 01:36:21,834
You're our machine?

1398
01:36:22,838 --> 01:36:24,465
- All right.
- Come on, machine.

1399
01:36:24,540 --> 01:36:26,531
Okay, hold on. Let's...
