1
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,400
Good afternoon.

2
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,500
We are now approaching Santorini
and its famous volcano.

3
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,600
Below you can see
the steep, active core...

4
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:45,700
and the sea-filled crater
named Caldera.

5
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,950
Please fasten your seat belts...

6
00:02:47,985 --> 00:02:50,100
and prepare to land
in Santorini.

7
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,100
Yeah! Welcome.

8
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,300
Cathy and Michael?
The jeep is out front.

9
00:03:25,335 --> 00:03:27,500
I'll get the luggage.

10
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,200
- He's got beautiful eyes.
- Yeah, I know.

11
00:03:30,235 --> 00:03:31,500
Your fiancé?

12
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,165
No. Maybe.

13
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,700
If you wanted romance,
you came to the right place.

14
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:45,200
- You've been here before.
- That's the whole deal.

15
00:03:45,235 --> 00:03:49,400
Nice-looking girls here.
Try Disco de Unitas.

16
00:03:49,435 --> 00:03:51,265
- Excuse me. Hi.
- Hi.

17
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:54,400
- Hi, Jean.
- Hi. How are you? Where's Roger?

18
00:03:54,435 --> 00:03:56,500
- He got married.
- Oh, that's a shame.

19
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:00,600
- You are not married, are you?
- Married? No.

20
00:04:00,635 --> 00:04:02,665
Wait, Jean.

21
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,000
This is your world
for the summer.

22
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,065
This is it.

23
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:05,300
Mostly natives and artists
live out here.

24
00:05:05,335 --> 00:05:07,700
I thought
you'd prefer this to town.

25
00:05:07,735 --> 00:05:10,065
The tourists barely come here.

26
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:12,100
We will have to walk
the rest of the way.

27
00:05:12,135 --> 00:05:13,400
It's great.

28
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,800
That's the villa.

29
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:22,265
It's beautiful.

30
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:25,300
Aspa, it's terrific.
Thanks.

31
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:43,900
This villa is at the far edge
and has the longest sun.

32
00:05:43,935 --> 00:05:47,900
Plus a wonderful view
of the volcano's core.

33
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:53,100
Alone at last,
you, me, and the volcano.

34
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,800
- Oh, wow.
- All right.

35
00:05:56,835 --> 00:05:59,000
It looks a bit bare...

36
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,765
but soon you'll have it
fixed to suit you.

37
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,600
Six thousand a week?
Expensive graduation present.

38
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:06,065
Drachmas.
It's only $100 a week.

39
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,600
I figure we can stay here
eight weeks if we don't eat.

40
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,365
The market's open until nine...

41
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,000
and there you'll find
everything you need...

42
00:06:12,035 --> 00:06:13,700
to set up housekeeping.

43
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,600
It's for you.

44
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,900
I've got to go now.

45
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,200
If you need me, you call me,
but I'm sure you won't need me.

46
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,300
Enjoy your stay. Good-bye.

47
00:06:26,335 --> 00:06:28,567
Thanks a lot, Aspa.

48
00:06:28,602 --> 00:06:30,800
Cathy, come here. Look.

49
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:37,000
- We're really here.
- We're really here.

50
00:06:37,035 --> 00:06:39,700
I can't tell you
how this place turns me on.

51
00:06:39,735 --> 00:06:41,100
Me, too.

52
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,900
Michael?

53
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,500
Good morning!

54
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,100
It's a great morning.

55
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,400
Don't you feel something?

56
00:07:40,435 --> 00:07:43,000
Yeah. Jet lag.

57
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,400
The birthplace of Apollo.

58
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,865
This is the sanctuary
of Dionysus.

59
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:05,000
Here's a fertility symbol.
Subtle, isn't it?

60
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:09,000
- Michael.
- All right.

61
00:08:09,035 --> 00:08:10,300
Come on up here.

62
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,100
Look at this beautiful mosaic.

63
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,100
What are you thinking about?

64
00:08:16,135 --> 00:08:18,700
Time.

65
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,400
It's about two thirty.

66
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,265
No, I meant centuries.

67
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,600
I was thinking
about the guy who made this.

68
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:30,200
His work is still here
after two thousand years.

69
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,400
What was he thinking
when he chipped right there?

70
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,100
Probably, what was for lunch?

71
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:41,000
We'll be dust, too,
in a hundred years.

72
00:08:41,035 --> 00:08:43,200
Excuse us.
Do you speak English?

73
00:08:43,235 --> 00:08:44,700
A little. Not so much.

74
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,000
Hi. Joe and Trish Saunders
from Cleveland, Ohio.

75
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,400
- Would you take our picture?
- We're on our honeymoon.

76
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,700
First time in Europe.
How about you?

77
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,300
You two married?

78
00:08:54,335 --> 00:08:55,565
Now, don't blink.

79
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,600
- I never blink.
- You always blink.

80
00:08:57,635 --> 00:08:59,600
- I think I blinked.
- I think I blinked.

81
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,100
This guy from Germany...

82
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,950
told us about this great gorge
in Crete to hike in.

83
00:09:05,985 --> 00:09:08,700
- We love to hike. Do you?
- I do, but he doesn't.

84
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,700
Why don't you both join us
because there's a ferry...

85
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,600
that leaves from the base
of Fira tomorrow at 7:30.

86
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:14,167
I think it's eight thirty.

87
00:09:14,202 --> 00:09:15,700
No, honey. It's seven thirty.

88
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:19,200
I brought the schedule.
It's right here. Right there!

89
00:09:19,235 --> 00:09:22,000
Well, anyway, we'd love
to have you join us.

90
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,065
Debbie, I told you
never to leave our sight.

91
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:40,600
And if I ever catch you again
with those foreign kids...

92
00:09:40,635 --> 00:09:42,600
young lady,
you're grounded permanently.

93
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,200
I feel a little overdressed.

94
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:51,200
Well, take your top down.

95
00:09:51,235 --> 00:09:52,867
Not today.

96
00:09:52,902 --> 00:09:54,500
Come on.

97
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,900
Look at those caves.

98
00:10:05,935 --> 00:10:07,865
Let's go exploring.

99
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,700
- I think I'll stay here.
- You sure?

100
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:27,300
We've been going together
almost five years?

101
00:11:27,335 --> 00:11:29,800
Yeah. We've known
each other for ten.

102
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,800
What do you want to do now?

103
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:49,700
- I got a surprise for you.
- Great.

104
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,600
- It's a darkroom. You like it?
- Are we giving up showers?

105
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:01,200
You're always telling me
to develop interests of my own.

106
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:05,600
I know. Keep developing.
I'll pick up some groceries.

107
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,465
Salut.

108
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,700
- Bonjour.
- Tiens.

109
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,000
Which one
should I send my mother?

110
00:14:31,035 --> 00:14:32,800
I don't know.
They're both great.

111
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:35,400
- When can I take a shower again?
- In the morning?

112
00:14:35,435 --> 00:14:37,867
- Do I have a choice?
- No.

113
00:14:37,902 --> 00:14:40,300
- Coming to bed?
- In a minute.

114
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,500
Race you.

115
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,500
We've been here a week,
and you're skinny-dipping.

116
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,665
You never did that at home.

117
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,200
I used to dream I was a mermaid.

118
00:15:59,235 --> 00:16:00,365
You cheated.

119
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,200
What else did you dream about?

120
00:16:02,235 --> 00:16:03,900
A few things.

121
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,365
Tell me one.

122
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,000
When I was in high school...

123
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,100
I used to fantasize
about being tied up...

124
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:11,100
and ravaged
by the entire swim team.

125
00:16:11,135 --> 00:16:13,317
The entire swim team?

126
00:16:13,352 --> 00:16:15,500
Maybe not Harvey Scholey.

127
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:20,700
Everyone always thinks of me
as such a goody two-shoes.

128
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:23,465
I have desires just like anyone.

129
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:26,400
Have you ever wanted
to explore them?

130
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,600
No, you satisfy me.

131
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:34,700
Couldn't you just have
a physical thing with someone?

132
00:16:34,735 --> 00:16:38,300
- I could, but why?
- For variety.

133
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:41,400
- We can have variety.
- How?

134
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:54,200
- Now, just relax.
- Relax?

135
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,200
You tied me too tight.
I can't move.

136
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:58,450
- That's the point.
- Oh. OK.

137
00:16:58,485 --> 00:17:00,342
OK, Cathy, I've had enough.

138
00:17:00,377 --> 00:17:02,200
Come on, Michael, you like it.

139
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:06,400
I think you actually enjoy
hurting me.

140
00:17:06,435 --> 00:17:08,400
It's not hurting.

141
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:11,700
It says right here
it's stimulating.

142
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:15,000
I hope they have a chapter
on first aid in that book.

143
00:17:15,035 --> 00:17:18,200
If I wanted to hurt you,
believe me, you'd know it.

144
00:17:18,235 --> 00:17:21,300
Perhaps I would put
the candle closer.

145
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,500
- Cut it out.
- It would be very hot.

146
00:17:23,535 --> 00:17:25,400
- No.
- Don't you trust me?

147
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:30,600
Yes, yes, yes, of course
I trust you. I trust you.

148
00:17:30,635 --> 00:17:32,800
You don't seem sure.

149
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:35,000
Are you afraid
that I might tickle you?

150
00:17:35,035 --> 00:17:36,867
No. No. Not that.

151
00:17:36,902 --> 00:17:38,700
Because I might.

152
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,700
Don't hunch your shoulders.
You have beautiful tits.

153
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:54,200
Pull'em back. That's better.
I'm gonna mail these in Fira.

154
00:17:54,235 --> 00:17:55,600
Oh, take this one.

155
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,000
Your mother. What'd you say?

156
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,050
Send candles.

157
00:18:01,085 --> 00:18:03,000
Very funny.

158
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:05,365
Stop reading those books.

159
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:08,200
I'm afraid of what
I'll come home to.

160
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:40,400
- Where you going?
- The beach.

161
00:18:40,435 --> 00:18:42,467
I'll drive you.

162
00:18:42,502 --> 00:18:44,500
I prefer the bus.

163
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,500
What is it you like about this?

164
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,800
I like people.

165
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:56,200
I've seen you several times now.

166
00:18:56,235 --> 00:18:58,317
You've been rather obvious.

167
00:18:58,352 --> 00:19:00,400
Sorry. Does it bother you?

168
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,500
- What's your name?
- Lina.

169
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,400
I'm Michael. Michael Pappas.

170
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,365
Where you from?

171
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,600
Do you want to know my sign?

172
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:16,700
- Not particularly.
- Good.

173
00:19:16,735 --> 00:19:19,367
That's a pretty camera.

174
00:19:19,402 --> 00:19:22,000
Can I-
take a picture?

175
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,200
What about the sign?

176
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,700
What's that?

177
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:51,000
What?

178
00:20:51,035 --> 00:20:53,200
Oh, that.

179
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:54,865
It's nothing.

180
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,400
See? It comes right off.

181
00:20:56,435 --> 00:20:59,200
It's nothing.

182
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:06,900
So, Lina...

183
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,100
what do you do?

184
00:21:08,135 --> 00:21:10,400
Why?

185
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,400
I'm just trying
to get to know you better.

186
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:16,000
So the most important thing
to know about me...

187
00:21:16,035 --> 00:21:17,700
is I hate questions.

188
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:34,400
There you are.

189
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,600
- Something wrong?
- No.

190
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:48,900
I just want
to be alone for a while.

191
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,900
You were alone all day, Michael.
What's the matter?

192
00:23:52,935 --> 00:23:54,800
Nothin'. Nothin'.

193
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:59,250
It's too complicated.

194
00:23:59,285 --> 00:24:01,700
What's too complicated?

195
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:04,400
Let's talk about it later.

196
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:13,350
Michael,
I'm doing the best I can.

197
00:24:13,385 --> 00:24:15,900
Look. I've even got
my shoulders back.

198
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,665
Tell me. Maybe I can help.

199
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:27,300
Look, I'm just confused
about a few things...

200
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:31,300
and I just need some time alone
to sort it all out.

201
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,700
We're here together, Michael.
You asked me to come.

202
00:24:33,735 --> 00:24:36,617
I know, I know. It's not you.

203
00:24:36,652 --> 00:24:39,500
It's me. It's this island.

204
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:43,000
Everything in my life till now
has been planned for me-

205
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:45,365
school, college...

206
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,300
when dad was alive,
working every summer...

207
00:24:47,335 --> 00:24:49,100
to learn the business.

208
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:53,800
It's the first time in my life
I can do what I want to do.

209
00:24:53,835 --> 00:24:55,100
You can do what you want.

210
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:02,100
I was with another girl
this afternoon.

211
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,600
I'm going through something here
I don't understand.

212
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:20,100
It's not 'cause I don't love you
'cause I do love you.

213
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,700
I don't know.

214
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:26,300
Maybe it was a mistake
to come here.

215
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:31,400
Maybe it was a mistake
to come here?

216
00:25:31,435 --> 00:25:33,900
You're the mistake, Michael.

217
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:40,700
You do what you have to do.
Get it out of your system.

218
00:25:40,735 --> 00:25:42,100
I'm going out.

219
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,300
You stink. You know that?

220
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,600
Yeah, I know that.

221
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:37,500
American?

222
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,000
How'd you guess?

223
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:41,400
Can I sit down for a minute?

224
00:26:41,435 --> 00:26:43,200
- Sure.
- My name's Bob.

225
00:26:43,235 --> 00:26:44,500
What's your name?

226
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,300
Have you been
on many of the islands?

227
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,200
- A couple.
- Which one is your favorite?

228
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,300
Santorini.

229
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:23,165
In Greek you say koli spera.

230
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,300
Do you have any other phrases
you'd like me to translate?

231
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,100
None that come to mind.

232
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:32,300
Listen, I'd love
to treat you to a souvlaki.

233
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,700
Thanks, but I think
I'll take a rain check.

234
00:27:34,735 --> 00:27:36,300
How about breakfast
tomorrow morning?

235
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,300
No. I don't think so.

236
00:27:38,335 --> 00:27:40,200
Yeah, sure. No problem.

237
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,500
Hi. I'm Yorghos.

238
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:49,400
I can tell you haven't yet seen
the real la.

239
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,850
I guess not.

240
00:27:51,885 --> 00:27:53,100
Come on.

241
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:10,600
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

242
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,300
Making love to you
is like riding a horse.

243
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:23,300
I only meant
the way you respond.

244
00:28:23,335 --> 00:28:25,500
You're very affectionate.

245
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,250
You must be very loved by her.

246
00:28:30,285 --> 00:28:33,300
- Her?
- The girl you live with.

247
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:36,200
I can see both of you
from here, too, you know.

248
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,300
Does she know you're here?

249
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,300
- What's her name?
- Cathy.

250
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:50,000
She's very lovely.

251
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:52,900
Yes, she is.

252
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:58,200
You know, it's not often
one finds people...

253
00:28:58,235 --> 00:28:59,600
who truly care about each other.

254
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,100
Sit down.

255
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:38,200
Do you want cocaine? Quaaludes?

256
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:39,800
No, thanks.

257
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:43,700
How about some wine?

258
00:29:43,735 --> 00:29:45,700
Yeah, that'd be nice.

259
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,500
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

260
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:36,600
You must've seen
a lot of movies.

261
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:40,065
No, we haven't got
a theater here.

262
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:42,600
My father has a television
in his shop.

263
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:53,400
Sorry.

264
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,800
Americans.

265
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,500
Where do you go every day?

266
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,065
That's a personal question.

267
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:08,100
A personal question?
We made love three times today.

268
00:31:08,135 --> 00:31:09,565
"Made love"?

269
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,600
I'd say we screwed.

270
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,200
When can we get together again?

271
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:16,800
What about Cathy?

272
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,200
We have an open relationship.

273
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,200
- You're up.
- Morning.

274
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:31,800
Morning? It's only, uh-
it is morning.

275
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,200
God damn you!

276
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:37,300
You told me
to get it out of my system.

277
00:31:37,335 --> 00:31:39,100
Well, I thought
I could handle it.

278
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,800
I wish I could, but I can't.

279
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:47,300
My attraction to Lina doesn't
change my feelings for you.

280
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,250
So, how many times did you come?

281
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:54,192
What are you
talking like that for?

282
00:31:54,227 --> 00:31:56,065
Oh, I know. Goody-goody Cathy...

283
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:59,200
doesn't say things like that,
right? Fuck you, Michael.

284
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:04,300
It wasn't the fireworks
you imagine.

285
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,765
Too bad.

286
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,000
I'm not lying.

287
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:12,500
Tell me, Michael,
is Lina the first?

288
00:32:12,535 --> 00:32:15,200
I've never cheated on you
before.

289
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:17,200
- Never?
- Never.

290
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:23,865
Maybe you'd just like me
to take off, go home.

291
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:26,800
That's what you want, isn't it,
so you can be with Lina?

292
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,100
I want to be with you.

293
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:45,900
So, what'd you do last night?

294
00:32:45,935 --> 00:32:47,900
Went to the Kiklos Café.

295
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,200
I met a Greek boy.

296
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:54,365
You know me?

297
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:57,000
Well, I know who you are.

298
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:01,300
I was just fixing some tea.
Would you like some?

299
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:11,600
Make yourself comfortable.
I'll be right back.

300
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,600
You have a lot of books
on archeology.

301
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:25,800
I'm an archeologist.

302
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:45,800
Have a seat.

303
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:57,000
- Lemon?
- No, thanks.

304
00:34:57,100 --> 00:35:00,100
- Sugar?
- Mm-mmm.

305
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,200
You did want tea?

306
00:35:04,235 --> 00:35:05,600
Sure.

307
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,400
I'm sorry. This was a mistake.

308
00:35:17,435 --> 00:35:20,465
No, no, no. Stay.

309
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:22,200
I don't know why I came.

310
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:25,700
I think I do.

311
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,800
And first
I want you to know something.

312
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:31,800
I'm not trying to steal Michael
away from you.

313
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:33,900
I'm not looking
for a relationship.

314
00:35:33,935 --> 00:35:35,200
And he's with you.

315
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:40,200
Anyway, I don't want
to deal anymore...

316
00:35:40,235 --> 00:35:42,800
with ego problems
and jealousies.

317
00:35:42,835 --> 00:35:45,000
You've never been jealous?

318
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:47,500
"Jealousy doesn't show
how much you love someone.

319
00:35:47,535 --> 00:35:50,500
"It shows how insecure you are. "

320
00:35:50,535 --> 00:35:51,900
Margaret Mead.

321
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,200
I think I have
that book here somewhere.

322
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:03,700
Anyway, I came to la
to get away from everything.

323
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:06,400
And I won't
be seeing Michael again.

324
00:36:06,435 --> 00:36:08,200
I'm not asking that.

325
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,800
I came here
to simplify my life.

326
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:16,000
Why?

327
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,100
C'est une longue histoire.

328
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:26,600
I mean, it's a long story.

329
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,400
I'd like to hear it.

330
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,900
I think I need a cigarette.

331
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:42,400
- Are you finished with that?
- Sure. Help yourself.

332
00:36:42,435 --> 00:36:44,400
You're hungry. That's good.

333
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:50,650
- She's very interesting.
- Who?

334
00:36:50,685 --> 00:36:53,700
- Lina.
- Lina? You met her? Where?

335
00:36:53,735 --> 00:36:55,265
I went to her house.

336
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:57,200
What did you do that for?
What happened?

337
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:59,750
- Nothing.
- What did she say?

338
00:36:59,785 --> 00:37:02,200
We talked about a lot of things.

339
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:04,500
Excuse me. Can I have
some more ice cream?

340
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,500
Cathy, like what?

341
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,600
Do you know anything
about her past?

342
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:13,065
She hasn't told you anything?

343
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:16,000
She doesn't like
to talk about herself.

344
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:18,565
Let's see...

345
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,765
she's from Deauville.

346
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,200
And then she moved to Paris,
where she got her degree.

347
00:37:23,235 --> 00:37:24,700
And then she lived
with an older married man...

348
00:37:24,735 --> 00:37:26,465
in Rome for a while.

349
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:29,600
- C'est une longue histoire.
- C'est une what?

350
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:32,900
It is easier
knowing who you're with.

351
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,700
Thanks.

352
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,500
You amaze me.

353
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,765
I amaze myself sometimes.

354
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,800
Anyway, we're going
to see her tomorrow.

355
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:46,865
"We"?

356
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:49,700
She's invited us to Akrotiri,
where she works.

357
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:53,265
Lina works.

358
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:55,600
You don't know much about her,
do you?

359
00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:01,500
So, when are we supposed
to see her?

360
00:38:01,535 --> 00:38:03,165
I told you, tomorrow.

361
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:06,750
The eruption of the volcano
in the late bronze age...

362
00:38:06,785 --> 00:38:10,300
buried this island beneath
a thick layer of lava ash.

363
00:38:10,335 --> 00:38:13,167
Our excavation
exposes this town...

364
00:38:13,202 --> 00:38:16,401
for the first time
since 1500 B.C.

365
00:38:16,436 --> 00:38:19,600
That explosion
shattered Santorini...

366
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:20,800
There she is.

367
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:43,800
Follow me.

368
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:57,000
This street is from the Minoan
level of the excavation.

369
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:59,600
It's the deepest
we've dug so far.

370
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:01,850
Is this your first
excavation job?

371
00:39:01,885 --> 00:39:04,000
She worked outside of Rome
last year.

372
00:39:04,035 --> 00:39:05,365
Look at this.

373
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,500
Every time I come upon
something this beautiful...

374
00:39:07,535 --> 00:39:08,665
I wonder to myself...

375
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:11,700
"Who formed this?
What was he like?"

376
00:39:11,735 --> 00:39:14,117
I'd like to show you
some more around...

377
00:39:14,152 --> 00:39:16,500
and maybe we can have lunch
at the beach.

378
00:39:16,535 --> 00:39:17,665
Let's.

379
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:20,365
- My favorite one is Perissa.
- Which one is that?

380
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,000
You know, the one we went to
that has the tiny pebbles.

381
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:30,700
This was a hand mill.
Part of the delta houses.

382
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,765
There were very beautiful
wall paintings...

383
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:35,900
but now everything is in Athens
in the museum...

384
00:39:35,935 --> 00:39:37,500
unfortunately.

385
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,600
Who took these?

386
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:14,750
- I like them.
- Thanks.

387
00:40:14,785 --> 00:40:16,842
I wish I could take photos.

388
00:40:16,877 --> 00:40:18,865
I find incredible objects...

389
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:21,000
laid out exactly
the way they were placed...

390
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:22,665
thousands of years ago.

391
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:26,000
Well, maybe Cathy
can shoot some for you.

392
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:54,800
This afternoon, when you two
went in opposite directions...

393
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,500
I wanted to follow both of you.

394
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,300
People are like gas.

395
00:41:07,335 --> 00:41:08,800
I beg your pardon?

396
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:12,000
I mean, gas fills
whatever space it's in...

397
00:41:12,035 --> 00:41:13,865
and people do, too.

398
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:16,200
They expand to fit the space.

399
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:22,600
I think I'll expand
into the kitchen and fix dinner.

400
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:32,200
When there is not enough space,
there is pressure.

401
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:38,900
People are like gas?

402
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,650
She thought it'd be better
if she didn't stay.

403
00:41:42,685 --> 00:41:44,900
- How perceptive of her.
- You invited her here.

404
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:49,200
I know.

405
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:00,900
I like her...

406
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,700
but when I see you with her...

407
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,600
What now?

408
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:26,800
- Looks real nice.
- You really like it?

409
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:29,100
- Hi, Anna.
- Hi, Cathy.

410
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:31,700
- Would you like to have a drink?
- Sure.

411
00:43:31,735 --> 00:43:33,300
You know Lina, don't you?

412
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:38,900
Hi. Yeah, she came to visit me
in Akrotiri the other day.

413
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,100
Good drawing.

414
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:48,700
It's really nice.

415
00:43:48,735 --> 00:43:50,100
Thank you.

416
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,700
I saw Lina yesterday.

417
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:55,800
Told her I might take
some pictures for her.

418
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:58,700
In Akrotiri? That'll be great.

419
00:43:58,735 --> 00:44:01,165
I told you I like her.

420
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:06,500
This is an anchor, but we don't
know how big the boat was.

421
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:09,300
Now I'd like to take a picture
of these steps here.

422
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:12,000
Each step was made
out of a single stone.

423
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:13,300
All the Greek gods...

424
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:15,300
they wore disguises
and all kinds of things...

425
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:18,300
and Dionysus would have been
disguised into a woman...

426
00:44:18,335 --> 00:44:19,700
to deceive his enemy.

427
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:25,900
So, well, he was the first
transvestite of the world.

428
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:30,600
Where are we going?

429
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:32,400
To Mykonos on a yacht.

430
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:34,200
Some friends
I haven't seen for years...

431
00:44:34,235 --> 00:44:35,800
are making a movie there...

432
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:38,600
and I thought it would be fun
or at least colorful.

433
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:53,200
Monica!

434
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:57,700
Come on!
You look beautiful today!

435
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:09,900
Andreas! Andreas, darling!
Look who's here!

436
00:45:09,935 --> 00:45:11,900
- Lina!
- Andreas!

437
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,065
You're back!

438
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:15,700
We're about to head for Mykonos.

439
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:17,500
Welcome to the Colossus.

440
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:21,100
At last, some fresh faces.

441
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:23,200
This party could use
some stimulation.

442
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:24,900
Cosmo, I want you
to meet some friends.

443
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,100
This is Cathy and Michael.

444
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:28,000
- How do you do?
- Better, thank you.

445
00:45:28,035 --> 00:45:29,800
Cosmo, stop it!
Back in your cage!

446
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:33,100
- Maybe you wanna go with me?
- Back to your cage!

447
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:38,900
Unusual group.

448
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,665
More ice, please.

449
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:47,065
Since I gave up tarot cards...

450
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:49,500
I've been getting very accurate
fortune cookies.

451
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:54,600
Hello, dear.

452
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:04,800
Cathy, come and steer
the Colossus.

453
00:46:04,835 --> 00:46:06,800
Feel her power.

454
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,600
So there you are.

455
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:13,200
I was just about to get a drink.

456
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:17,400
Jonathan,
I want you to meet with Mike.

457
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:18,965
He's an American, too.

458
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,500
- How are you?
- Good, how are you?

459
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:21,700
Michael Pappas.

460
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:28,100
- Connecticut.
- I see you've met my husband.

461
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:30,100
You see the cove there?

462
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:43,200
Oh, Cathy,
can I talk to you a second?

463
00:46:43,235 --> 00:46:44,400
Sure.

464
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:50,100
I'm sorry. This is not exactly
what I was expecting.

465
00:46:50,135 --> 00:46:52,000
No one's gonna believe
my photos.

466
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:56,800
Oh, my God. You're gonna have
a strange impression of me now.

467
00:46:56,900 --> 00:46:58,465
I'm having a great time.

468
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:01,900
You know, when I was young,
this was like a circus for me.

469
00:47:01,935 --> 00:47:04,200
- It hasn't changed much.
- Michael.

470
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:08,400
You told us
it was going to be colorful.

471
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:09,700
You didn't say day-glo.

472
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:12,600
Hey, it's a party.

473
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:15,700
Let's drink.

474
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:18,865
"Jet Set" playback take 1.

475
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:20,800
Here is the surprise
I promised to you.

476
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:06,400
It'll be good
to be on sane land again.

477
00:48:06,435 --> 00:48:07,700
Watch out.

478
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:20,400
Oh, what a day.

479
00:48:20,435 --> 00:48:21,800
Some wine?

480
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:23,800
No, thanks.

481
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:26,100
We'll all be dust
in a hundred years.

482
00:48:26,135 --> 00:48:29,300
Has anyone seen my camera strap?

483
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:30,865
My pants were falling down...

484
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:34,000
and I needed protection
from Cosmo. You want it?

485
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:36,400
Well, come and get it.

486
00:48:36,435 --> 00:48:37,600
- OK.
- Come on.

487
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:56,900
Well, I'll go now.

488
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,500
The party's not over.

489
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:01,100
Will you say good night for me?

490
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,600
Sure.

491
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:10,965
Where is Lina?

492
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,900
- She went home.
- Why?

493
00:49:12,935 --> 00:49:15,017
Because she was tired.

494
00:49:15,052 --> 00:49:17,100
- Are you tired?
- No.

495
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:22,300
I wanna take a shower!

496
00:49:22,335 --> 00:49:23,865
Michael, if you do-

497
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:26,200
Thanks for getting
in the shower with me.

498
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:49,700
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

499
00:49:49,735 --> 00:49:51,565
- Be careful.
- Watch out.

500
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:54,400
- What's this?
- It's a waterbed.

501
00:49:54,435 --> 00:49:56,600
Oh, God.

502
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:10,100
Look,
the paintings from Akrotiri.

503
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:12,700
I love it. It suits you.

504
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:18,300
- Whoa! The Three Stooges!
- Not again.

505
00:50:18,335 --> 00:50:20,400
- Who are they?
- Come on.

506
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:27,700
One, two, three.

507
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:32,000
- Leave him alone.
- I'm quittin'.

508
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:33,300
Put up your hands.

509
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:37,700
Listen, ape... there.

510
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:40,200
- What's the matter?
- Why don't you leave him alone?

511
00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:42,400
I'm not dancing.

512
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:44,700
Hey, put your hand on your ear.

513
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:47,600
Here's a dance
that's most popular in society.

514
00:50:47,635 --> 00:50:49,100
You'll never go amiss
doing this.

515
00:50:49,135 --> 00:50:50,400
Do exactly what I do.

516
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:55,400
Well, get started.

517
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:38,900
You know the other day when
I brought you the breakfast?

518
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,000
Seeing you and Michael
together...

519
00:51:42,035 --> 00:51:43,700
it moved me.

520
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:45,300
It did?

521
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:48,100
I don't think I could see
you and Michael in bed together.

522
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:50,450
Oh, you could.

523
00:51:50,485 --> 00:51:52,700
I don't know.

524
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:55,250
At first I was jealous.

525
00:51:55,285 --> 00:51:57,700
Well, what about now?

526
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:10,500
We could use a man right now.

527
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:11,800
Just saying good-bye to people,
you know?

528
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:13,100
But you're always saying hello.

529
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:17,865
Amazing perception...

530
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:20,500
that I was inside the head
of this huge giant...

531
00:52:20,535 --> 00:52:22,300
and there were
all these technicians...

532
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:25,700
working at this big panel
inside his brain...

533
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:27,165
and they were facing...

534
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:30,400
those enormous, huge
picture windows...

535
00:52:30,435 --> 00:52:32,100
which were his eyes.

536
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:35,765
Did you know that fire exists...

537
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:38,400
only if each
of three elements are present?

538
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:42,200
Heat, fuel, oxygen.

539
00:52:42,235 --> 00:52:44,867
Lose one, it goes out.

540
00:52:44,902 --> 00:52:47,500
Where did you learn that?

541
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:49,965
Boy scouts. Where else?

542
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:54,600
Faster and faster and faster!

543
00:52:54,635 --> 00:52:56,265
Then what happened?

544
00:52:56,300 --> 00:52:59,300
I sat down.
I decided to give it a rest.

545
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:01,200
Do you want some wine?
I'll get some more wine, OK?

546
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:03,400
Yeah, get some wine.
That'll be great.

547
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:11,800
Hey, Dimitri, got a new lover?

548
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:26,750
Want a joint?

549
00:53:26,785 --> 00:53:28,400
No, thanks.

550
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:33,200
- Come on.
- No. I'm going back.

551
00:53:33,235 --> 00:53:35,600
Hey, what's wrong?
Sorry.

552
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:44,100
Brava.

553
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:47,100
Would you like to take a walk?

554
00:53:47,135 --> 00:53:48,700
We're together.

555
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:51,500
Well, I can find someone
for her.

556
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:54,100
How about him, there?
The guy in the blue sweater.

557
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:57,000
- That would work.
- Yeah?

558
00:53:57,100 --> 00:54:00,100
- What happened?
- Oh, nothing.

559
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:04,600
Let's go.

560
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:07,000
I think the girl on the left
there quite fancies you.

561
00:54:07,035 --> 00:54:09,300
Do you see her? The one
on the left there with Ann.

562
00:54:09,335 --> 00:54:10,965
He's handsome.

563
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,300
It's been
sort of a lonely night.

564
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:14,850
- Are you alone?
- Uh-uh.

565
00:54:14,885 --> 00:54:17,300
- Then who are you with?
- Him.

566
00:54:17,335 --> 00:54:20,000
- With him?
- I mean, them.

567
00:54:20,035 --> 00:54:21,500
Them.

568
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:30,865
Is he going to dive?

569
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:33,200
- He's going to jump.
- How do you know?

570
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:35,265
He always jumps.

571
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:37,900
Now he'll pace
back and forth...

572
00:54:37,935 --> 00:54:39,765
stop...

573
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:41,500
more pacing...

574
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:44,765
stop...

575
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:47,400
up and down on his toes...

576
00:54:47,435 --> 00:54:50,000
cover his balls and jump.

577
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,900
He dove.

578
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,100
My God.
You'd never catch me doing that.

579
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:03,800
I'm terrified of heights.

580
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:07,300
Have you ever seen him cry?

581
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:09,350
He cried when his father died.

582
00:55:09,385 --> 00:55:11,300
I'd like to see
that side of him.

583
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:20,900
Your shoulders are getting red.

584
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:23,900
Put some sunblock.

585
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:28,200
Have you always had short hair?

586
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:30,465
I cut mine
after I broke with Maro.

587
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:33,500
I always cut my hair
when I need a change.

588
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:35,100
Maybe I'll cut mine.

589
00:55:35,135 --> 00:55:36,565
Do you need a change?

590
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:39,800
I still look like I did
when I was twelve.

591
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:44,000
I thought I wanted to look
like a little girl forever.

592
00:55:44,100 --> 00:55:46,400
It didn't work.

593
00:55:51,700 --> 00:55:54,100
- Where do your parents live?
- I don't know.

594
00:55:55,300 --> 00:55:58,600
When I was fifteen,
my parents fired me.

595
00:55:58,635 --> 00:56:00,300
Fired you?

596
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:01,865
Well, they told me
to leave home...

597
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:05,065
and then I met Monica,
and she let me stay with her.

598
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:09,300
My mother's just the opposite.
She never let me leave home.

599
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:11,300
She didn't want me
to live with Michael.

600
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:13,365
She didn't even want me
to come to Greece.

601
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:17,100
I guess it's not so bad to have
someone who cares for you.

602
00:56:17,135 --> 00:56:19,965
I guess.

603
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,165
Was Maro a good lover?

604
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:24,400
I don't want to talk about Maro.

605
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:26,665
You've had so many adventures.

606
00:56:26,700 --> 00:56:29,000
I've often wondered what
a life like that would be like.

607
00:56:29,035 --> 00:56:32,065
- Like what?
- Free, open.

608
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:34,200
Well, it's easier to say
than to do.

609
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:36,500
But if you're somewhat secure
with yourself...

610
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:39,300
you can experiment
anything you want.

611
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:42,150
I guess
I'm afraid of being hurt.

612
00:56:42,185 --> 00:56:44,865
But it's just like exercising.

613
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:48,300
It can hurt at first,
but then it becomes a pleasure.

614
00:56:48,335 --> 00:56:50,765
Then I worry
about the consequences.

615
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:53,500
- What consequences?
- What would my parents think?

616
00:56:53,535 --> 00:56:55,800
What would Michael think?
What would I think?

617
00:56:55,835 --> 00:56:57,000
Stop thinking so much.

618
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:00,500
They're great.

619
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:02,000
You know, if you live
on the rim of a volcano...

620
00:57:02,100 --> 00:57:05,900
that could blow up at any time,
you are taking a chance.

621
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:10,000
I think if you want to feel
alive, you must take risks.

622
00:57:10,100 --> 00:57:11,900
I'm beginning to see that.

623
00:57:48,100 --> 00:57:49,300
Go on.

624
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:11,400
Try again.

625
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:36,700
Are you OK?

626
01:01:36,735 --> 01:01:38,800
Fine. Why?

627
01:01:38,900 --> 01:01:41,000
I mean, about...

628
01:01:41,100 --> 01:01:44,900
I've never been in the same bed
with a woman before.

629
01:01:44,935 --> 01:01:46,865
I know.

630
01:01:46,900 --> 01:01:48,700
We shared you.

631
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:51,800
I know. Are you OK?

632
01:01:51,835 --> 01:01:54,800
I'm fine, Michael.

633
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:04,500
Good morning.

634
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:22,800
Come on.

635
01:02:26,700 --> 01:02:28,200
Is that OK?

636
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:44,000
What's going on?

637
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:29,700
I'm starving.

638
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:31,400
I'll get Michael.

639
01:04:43,300 --> 01:04:45,100
What do you think?
Too much sun?

640
01:04:45,135 --> 01:04:47,700
Yeah. Too much sun.

641
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:17,800
Who left their bathing suit
in the sink?

642
01:06:17,835 --> 01:06:18,965
I always leave mine outside.

643
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,565
Well, I know it's not mine.
Lina?

644
01:06:21,600 --> 01:06:24,000
Yeah, it's mine. Could you
put it outside, please?

645
01:06:24,100 --> 01:06:26,400
- I'll be glad to.
- Thank you.

646
01:06:30,500 --> 01:06:32,465
Relax, Michael.

647
01:06:32,500 --> 01:06:33,865
I can't live like this!

648
01:06:33,900 --> 01:06:37,200
- Don't get so uptight.
- Well, look at this place!

649
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:42,700
Maybe we should divide up
some of the chores around here.

650
01:06:42,735 --> 01:06:44,500
Great.
Why don't you make dinner?

651
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,465
All right. I will.

652
01:06:48,500 --> 01:06:50,800
Great.
Then I'll clean up the house.

653
01:06:54,100 --> 01:06:57,300
Cathy, could you come here
a minute, please?

654
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:05,765
- What's happened to you?
- Nothing.

655
01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:07,400
Well, you always
kept the place spotless.

656
01:07:07,435 --> 01:07:08,500
Why should I do everything?

657
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:10,200
I like your idea
of dividing up the chores.

658
01:07:10,235 --> 01:07:12,065
But there's other things.

659
01:07:12,100 --> 01:07:14,200
Your photographic chemicals
smell up the place...

660
01:07:14,300 --> 01:07:15,800
you've been using
my razor again-

661
01:07:15,835 --> 01:07:17,300
How do you know it was me?

662
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:19,400
And what about you always
leaving the toilet seat up?

663
01:08:02,200 --> 01:08:04,000
Michael, did you do this
on purpose?

664
01:08:08,500 --> 01:08:10,300
I think he deserves
his present for this.

665
01:08:10,335 --> 01:08:11,700
He certainly does.

666
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:14,400
What's this?

667
01:08:14,500 --> 01:08:16,900
It's an inspirational gift
from an ancient religion...

668
01:08:16,935 --> 01:08:20,300
to deal with
the eternal battle of sexes.

669
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:33,700
It's a perfect likeness,
but I can't play the flute.

670
01:08:33,735 --> 01:08:36,500
- Let's go dancing.
- Let's stay home tonight.

671
01:08:36,535 --> 01:08:38,400
- I want to go, too.
- Yeah, let's go.

672
01:08:38,435 --> 01:08:39,500
OK, we'll go.

673
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:41,800
Good night, Michael.
See you later.

674
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:22,800
It's finished.

675
01:09:24,900 --> 01:09:26,700
Whoa. It's a tit.

676
01:09:26,800 --> 01:09:29,450
No. It's an aerial view
of Santorini.

677
01:09:29,485 --> 01:09:32,100
There's la and Fira,
and that's the core.

678
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:35,500
I'm sorry. I must admit
I thought it was a tit, too.

679
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:37,400
You two have sex on the brain.

680
01:09:37,500 --> 01:09:41,200
And why not,
with this beauty everywhere?

681
01:09:41,235 --> 01:09:44,400
Have you ever slept with a man?

682
01:09:44,500 --> 01:09:45,700
I've been close to men before.

683
01:09:45,800 --> 01:09:48,700
Don't pursue it.
Life is complicated enough.

684
01:10:17,300 --> 01:10:19,200
- Just relax.
- God!

685
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:24,700
Where does it hurt?

686
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:25,865
I'm OK.

687
01:10:25,900 --> 01:10:28,300
You sure scared us
for a little sprain.

688
01:10:28,335 --> 01:10:30,700
- It's not serious.
- No, of course not.

689
01:10:33,300 --> 01:10:34,465
How do you feel?

690
01:10:34,500 --> 01:10:38,400
Fine, but it's my first
and last time on a moped.

691
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,900
When I was a little girl,
I thought all Americans...

692
01:10:48,935 --> 01:10:52,400
were carrying guns
and wearing cowboy hats.

693
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:17,300
Happy birthday, dear Lina

694
01:11:17,335 --> 01:11:20,067
Happy birthday, dear friend

695
01:11:20,102 --> 01:11:22,800
Our love will grow stronger

696
01:11:22,835 --> 01:11:25,700
And it never will end

697
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:29,100
You're another year older

698
01:11:29,135 --> 01:11:31,400
Over the hill

699
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:35,000
So we threw you a party

700
01:11:35,035 --> 01:11:38,500
And we'll send you the bill

701
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:40,200
Bon anniversaire!

702
01:11:42,300 --> 01:11:43,965
I never had-

703
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,400
I've never had
a surprise party before.

704
01:11:46,500 --> 01:11:49,400
I didn't even remember
this was my birthday.

705
01:11:49,500 --> 01:11:51,000
Come on, come on.

706
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:56,100
This is beautiful.

707
01:11:56,200 --> 01:11:58,865
That's us.

708
01:11:58,900 --> 01:12:02,100
Come on. We've got
another surprise for you.

709
01:12:02,135 --> 01:12:04,700
Voilà.
Come on, come on, come on.

710
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:07,800
You stand back.

711
01:12:10,100 --> 01:12:11,300
A volcano.

712
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:28,100
What's the occasion?

713
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:30,150
Lina's birthday.

714
01:12:30,185 --> 01:12:32,100
- Yasou.
- Yasou.

715
01:12:34,300 --> 01:12:35,800
Good night.

716
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:45,900
Hey. What's the matter?
Didn't you like my fireworks?

717
01:12:45,935 --> 01:12:49,600
- Are you OK?
- Yeah. I'm just very happy.

718
01:12:49,635 --> 01:12:51,465
I want to remember this
all my life.

719
01:12:51,500 --> 01:12:54,300
You talk as if
it's all downhill from here.

720
01:12:54,335 --> 01:12:56,800
But I don't want it to end.

721
01:12:56,835 --> 01:12:59,300
It doesn't have to.

722
01:12:59,400 --> 01:13:01,800
Once we're apart,
it's gonna be all different.

723
01:13:03,300 --> 01:13:05,700
So we better have a good time!

724
01:13:10,300 --> 01:13:12,665
Hey, a little salad?

725
01:13:12,700 --> 01:13:16,100
- You're crazy.
- Come on!

726
01:13:16,135 --> 01:13:17,717
This is not funny!

727
01:13:17,752 --> 01:13:19,300
You wanna be serious?

728
01:13:19,400 --> 01:13:22,300
How about a serious
olive oil party?

729
01:13:38,900 --> 01:13:40,200
Shampoo?

730
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:45,200
Happy birthday.

731
01:13:59,100 --> 01:14:01,300
OK, can we be serious now?

732
01:14:01,400 --> 01:14:02,500
Sure.

733
01:14:04,500 --> 01:14:05,700
Sit down.

734
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:11,100
I see your arm's all better.

735
01:14:32,500 --> 01:14:35,100
Here's my donkey.
OK, Barbara.

736
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:38,500
Somebody hold my stirrup.

737
01:14:45,200 --> 01:14:46,700
What's so funny?

738
01:14:48,500 --> 01:14:51,000
Somebody better be ready
with a taco salad.

739
01:14:51,100 --> 01:14:55,065
I can hardly wait to see them.

740
01:14:55,100 --> 01:14:58,100
Jean, I can't believe
we're living through this.

741
01:14:58,200 --> 01:15:03,200
Oh, well. Come on, old paint,
let's go for it!

742
01:15:03,300 --> 01:15:05,150
Race you to the top!

743
01:15:05,185 --> 01:15:07,000
Oh, your ass! Sorry.

744
01:15:09,400 --> 01:15:12,200
Oh, Jean, shouldn't we call them
and tell them we're here?

745
01:15:12,300 --> 01:15:14,500
They don't have a phone.
I'll get us rooms tonight.

746
01:15:14,535 --> 01:15:16,000
How many douches
did you have, Miss?

747
01:15:16,035 --> 01:15:18,100
He means showers.

748
01:15:19,700 --> 01:15:21,900
Aren't they ever gonna finish
Greece?

749
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,250
That must be it right there.

750
01:15:24,285 --> 01:15:26,500
That's it? Oh, hallelujah.

751
01:15:26,535 --> 01:15:28,700
There we go. You OK?

752
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:31,800
I haven't been OK
since we left the ship.

753
01:15:31,900 --> 01:15:34,200
Would you stop laughing?

754
01:15:34,235 --> 01:15:36,367
- Fifty-eight!
- Fifty-eight?

755
01:15:36,402 --> 01:15:38,500
- Fifty-eight!
- Thank you, lord.

756
01:15:38,535 --> 01:15:40,100
I think I'm OK.

757
01:15:41,700 --> 01:15:43,565
What on earth has been going on?

758
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:45,800
Whatever it was,
I'm sorry we missed it.

759
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:09,300
Mrs. Featherstone.

760
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:11,400
And you know my friend Barbara.

761
01:16:11,435 --> 01:16:13,800
Sure, Mrs. Foster.

762
01:16:13,900 --> 01:16:15,065
What are you doing here?

763
01:16:15,100 --> 01:16:18,100
That's a good question, Michael.
What are we doing here?

764
01:16:18,200 --> 01:16:19,300
We thought
we'd surprise you two.

765
01:16:19,400 --> 01:16:20,465
Surprise.

766
01:16:20,500 --> 01:16:22,300
Who's there, Michael?

767
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:24,465
Lina, this is Cathy's mother.

768
01:16:24,500 --> 01:16:27,200
Mrs. Featherstone
and her friend Mrs. Foster.

769
01:16:27,235 --> 01:16:29,800
Enchanté.

770
01:16:29,900 --> 01:16:31,000
Charmed.

771
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:37,200
Oh, I'm sorry. This is oil.

772
01:16:37,235 --> 01:16:39,100
Refreshing.

773
01:17:05,100 --> 01:17:07,600
- Mom.
- Cathy.

774
01:17:07,700 --> 01:17:09,100
Mrs. Foster.

775
01:17:11,200 --> 01:17:13,300
What are you doing here?

776
01:17:13,400 --> 01:17:15,000
Well, we were
in the neighborhood...

777
01:17:15,100 --> 01:17:17,300
so we thought we'd just drop in.

778
01:17:17,335 --> 01:17:18,700
Drop in?

779
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:22,200
I see you've all met.

780
01:17:22,300 --> 01:17:24,600
Oh, yes. We certainly have.

781
01:17:28,300 --> 01:17:30,400
We had a little birthday party.

782
01:17:31,900 --> 01:17:34,100
- What is going on?
- Nothing.

783
01:17:34,135 --> 01:17:36,265
Well, who's that strange girl?

784
01:17:36,300 --> 01:17:38,500
Lina, the one I wrote you about,
and she's not strange.

785
01:17:38,535 --> 01:17:41,100
What was she doing
with Michael down there?

786
01:17:41,200 --> 01:17:43,100
When did you two decide to come?

787
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:45,300
We two didn't decide.
It was...

788
01:17:45,400 --> 01:17:47,300
Don't change the subject.

789
01:17:47,335 --> 01:17:48,800
Change the subject.

790
01:18:01,200 --> 01:18:03,800
Well, at least it's over.

791
01:18:03,900 --> 01:18:07,000
- Not quite.
- What do you mean?

792
01:18:07,035 --> 01:18:08,700
She's invited us to dinner.

793
01:18:08,735 --> 01:18:10,200
Sounds like fun.

794
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:30,900
Jean,
are they joined at the hip?

795
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:32,200
Sweetheart.

796
01:18:34,900 --> 01:18:37,150
Enchanté.

797
01:18:37,185 --> 01:18:39,400
Touché.

798
01:18:39,500 --> 01:18:41,965
- Hi, Cathy.
- Hi, Aunt Barbara.

799
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:43,900
Well, we've all been having
some wine here.

800
01:18:43,935 --> 01:18:45,500
What would you like to drink,
Michael?

801
01:18:45,535 --> 01:18:47,100
The local wine is terrific.

802
01:18:47,135 --> 01:18:49,200
- Wine.
- Wine.

803
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:02,100
That's a lovely dress
you have on. Where'd you get it?

804
01:19:02,135 --> 01:19:03,400
Here in Santorini.

805
01:19:03,500 --> 01:19:06,265
Santorini? You're kidding.

806
01:19:06,300 --> 01:19:08,900
Lina, it was so nice that
you could join us for dinner.

807
01:19:08,935 --> 01:19:11,000
My pleasure.

808
01:19:11,100 --> 01:19:12,600
Another surprise.

809
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:17,600
So, this is your first dinner
in Santorini.

810
01:19:17,635 --> 01:19:19,717
I think that's cause
for celebration.

811
01:19:19,752 --> 01:19:21,800
Here's to Santorini
and all of us.

812
01:19:23,100 --> 01:19:25,600
All five of us.

813
01:19:25,635 --> 01:19:27,917
- Yasa.
- Yasa.

814
01:19:27,952 --> 01:19:30,200
Oh, how Greek.

815
01:19:30,300 --> 01:19:33,400
You know, I took a night course
once in Greek mythology...

816
01:19:33,500 --> 01:19:36,400
and I found out that Bacchus
is the god of wine.

817
01:19:36,435 --> 01:19:39,367
Uh, well, Bacchus
was a Roman god actually.

818
01:19:39,402 --> 01:19:42,300
The one you're thinking of
must be Dionysus.

819
01:19:42,335 --> 01:19:44,500
Oh, yeah, that decadent god.

820
01:19:44,600 --> 01:19:47,965
Well, actually,
in Greek mythology...

821
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:51,600
freedom represents
the highest form of learning...

822
01:19:51,635 --> 01:19:53,000
not the drunken orgy.

823
01:19:56,600 --> 01:19:58,665
So, you came up on the donkeys.

824
01:19:58,700 --> 01:20:00,900
Oh, yes,
it was quite an adventure...

825
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,900
with my friend here
and her five-inch heels.

826
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:07,000
Tell me, Lina,
are you here on vacation...

827
01:20:07,035 --> 01:20:08,765
or do you live here
all year round?

828
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:11,400
Well, I'll stay here
until I finish my work.

829
01:20:11,500 --> 01:20:14,800
Lina's an archeologist.
She also has a beautiful villa.

830
01:20:14,900 --> 01:20:15,900
Where?

831
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,065
Well, I used to have it...

832
01:20:18,100 --> 01:20:20,600
until I moved in
with Michael and Cathy.

833
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:32,100
Wonderful! I love ouzo.

834
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:36,500
Cathy, would you explain
all of this to me?

835
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:39,300
Stop worrying, really. I've
never been happier in my life.

836
01:20:39,335 --> 01:20:41,065
I will say
you look very happy...

837
01:20:41,100 --> 01:20:43,400
so I have no reason
to be worried, right?

838
01:20:43,500 --> 01:20:45,500
So, you tell me,
why am I so worried?

839
01:20:45,535 --> 01:20:48,800
Bonsoir. I can make it.
Bonsoir.

840
01:20:48,900 --> 01:20:49,965
I'm going to say good-bye
to you now...

841
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:51,900
because we have to leave
so early in the morning.

842
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:55,200
Oh, Cathy. I love you.

843
01:20:55,235 --> 01:20:56,700
I love you, too.

844
01:21:04,100 --> 01:21:07,300
Do you want to watch television?

845
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:09,300
In my father's shop?

846
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:14,400
Let's get out of here!

847
01:24:04,900 --> 01:24:07,350
She knew I was fixing
moussaka tonight.

848
01:24:07,385 --> 01:24:09,800
That's probably why
she skipped dinner.

849
01:24:18,600 --> 01:24:20,700
Three thirty.

850
01:24:43,100 --> 01:24:44,665
Any coffee left?

851
01:24:44,700 --> 01:24:46,900
A little, but I think it's cold.

852
01:24:46,935 --> 01:24:48,300
So, where were you?

853
01:24:48,400 --> 01:24:50,400
You should have let us know.
We were worried about you.

854
01:24:50,500 --> 01:24:53,400
Oh, I'm sorry. I was not aware
of that obligation.

855
01:24:57,900 --> 01:24:59,100
I think I'll get some more.

856
01:25:16,200 --> 01:25:18,800
You want to talk about
last night?

857
01:25:18,835 --> 01:25:22,500
Yeah. I was out with someone.

858
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:29,165
Why?

859
01:25:29,200 --> 01:25:30,965
If I feel attracted
to a person...

860
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:34,000
I want to feel free
to go with that person.

861
01:25:34,100 --> 01:25:35,765
You can understand that.

862
01:25:35,800 --> 01:25:38,700
You know what an open
relationship is like, don't you?

863
01:25:45,100 --> 01:25:46,600
We love each other.

864
01:25:49,600 --> 01:25:52,000
We're like a family.

865
01:25:54,300 --> 01:25:55,700
So, you think you know me?

866
01:25:58,300 --> 01:26:00,600
What's my last name?

867
01:26:11,100 --> 01:26:12,300
Merde!

868
01:26:16,500 --> 01:26:18,200
What did she say?

869
01:26:18,235 --> 01:26:19,500
Nothing.

870
01:26:22,200 --> 01:26:23,900
I don't know.
Something in French.

871
01:26:23,935 --> 01:26:25,600
I don't know
what's going on here.

872
01:26:27,900 --> 01:26:29,900
She'll be back.

873
01:26:54,700 --> 01:26:57,500
Hi, Cathy.
Where's your French girlfriend?

874
01:26:59,300 --> 01:27:01,100
Oh, Greek.

875
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:12,900
Motor!

876
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:14,900
Playback. Quiet on the set.

877
01:27:26,700 --> 01:27:29,700
Lina! You made it!

878
01:27:29,800 --> 01:27:31,600
This is Jan Tolin.

879
01:27:31,700 --> 01:27:34,465
Hello.
Andreas, Lina is here!

880
01:27:34,500 --> 01:27:36,800
Lina, tell the director
to put you in the picture!

881
01:27:36,900 --> 01:27:38,900
We're just passing by.

882
01:27:38,935 --> 01:27:40,865
Can we just watch?

883
01:27:40,900 --> 01:27:44,500
Sure. Come in.
This is my dressing room.

884
01:27:44,535 --> 01:27:47,100
- Oh, it's nice.
- Thank you.

885
01:27:47,200 --> 01:27:49,400
- And I love your outfit.
- Thank you.

886
01:27:50,800 --> 01:27:52,300
So, when are you gonna shoot?

887
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:55,200
I'm in the next scene.
I must get ready.

888
01:27:55,300 --> 01:27:56,700
I'll wait outside.

889
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,200
Where are your American friends?

890
01:28:39,300 --> 01:28:40,900
Let's not talk about that.

891
01:28:40,935 --> 01:28:42,200
You don't seem happy.

892
01:28:43,700 --> 01:28:45,400
On the yacht,
I watched you with them...

893
01:28:45,435 --> 01:28:46,700
and you were happy then.

894
01:28:50,500 --> 01:28:52,000
I must go.

895
01:28:54,700 --> 01:28:56,800
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

896
01:28:57,900 --> 01:28:59,600
No, no, no! Stop! Stop!

897
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:09,500
Do you want to stay?

898
01:29:09,535 --> 01:29:11,700
You want to go?

899
01:29:11,735 --> 01:29:12,900
Come on.

900
01:29:28,300 --> 01:29:29,900
Excuse me.
Have you seen Lina?

901
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:31,700
Sorry, I haven't.

902
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:41,665
Excuse me.
Is Lina working today?

903
01:29:41,700 --> 01:29:43,950
No, I haven't seen her
since a couple of days.

904
01:29:43,985 --> 01:29:46,200
If you do, will you tell her
that I came by?

905
01:29:46,235 --> 01:29:47,400
Certainly, I will.

906
01:29:53,900 --> 01:29:55,200
My friend Lina?

907
01:30:17,400 --> 01:30:18,500
Here.

908
01:30:19,600 --> 01:30:20,965
Read this.

909
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:22,465
I'm reading this.

910
01:30:22,500 --> 01:30:24,200
Well, could you just read
the first paragraph...

911
01:30:24,235 --> 01:30:26,700
just for a minute?
It's worth it.

912
01:30:26,800 --> 01:30:29,200
- He's a great writer.
- I'll read it out loud.

913
01:30:29,235 --> 01:30:31,700
Don't read it out loud.
It's more private.

914
01:30:31,800 --> 01:30:34,900
Just-it'll be good.

915
01:30:38,700 --> 01:30:39,965
It's beautiful.

916
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,400
- Did you read the whole thing?
- No, I just read the top...

917
01:30:42,500 --> 01:30:44,600
but I really like it. I want
to finish this sentence...

918
01:30:44,635 --> 01:30:46,400
before I forget
what he was saying.

919
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,300
It was fun.

920
01:31:32,700 --> 01:31:34,400
Nice face.

921
01:31:37,500 --> 01:31:38,800
Cheers.

922
01:32:07,400 --> 01:32:10,400
I'm gonna get some more wine.
You want anything?

923
01:32:12,300 --> 01:32:15,165
What was it?

924
01:32:15,200 --> 01:32:18,400
- Didn't it mean a thing to her?
- Take it easy, Michael.

925
01:32:18,500 --> 01:32:20,400
Well, what's she doing?

926
01:32:20,500 --> 01:32:22,750
- She's afraid.
- Of what?

927
01:32:22,785 --> 01:32:25,000
Getting close to people.

928
01:32:25,100 --> 01:32:27,100
She's never had that until us.

929
01:32:27,200 --> 01:32:29,400
Everybody's afraid
of getting close.

930
01:32:34,500 --> 01:32:38,900
I just wish that we could
find her and talk to her.

931
01:32:38,935 --> 01:32:43,300
Me, too, but I guess
she doesn't want to be found.

932
01:32:49,700 --> 01:32:51,900
You want to go home, Michael?

933
01:32:54,900 --> 01:32:57,350
We got three weeks left.

934
01:32:57,385 --> 01:32:59,800
We can keep looking.

935
01:33:01,400 --> 01:33:03,400
Do you want to stay,
and I'll go home?

936
01:33:11,700 --> 01:33:13,665
But you are paid
for three more weeks.

937
01:33:13,700 --> 01:33:16,000
I'll leave it empty in case
you change your mind, OK?

938
01:33:16,035 --> 01:33:17,100
Thank you.

939
01:33:17,200 --> 01:33:18,900
- Did you have a nice summer?
- Very nice.

940
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:21,400
- Maybe we'll see you next year.
- Maybe.
