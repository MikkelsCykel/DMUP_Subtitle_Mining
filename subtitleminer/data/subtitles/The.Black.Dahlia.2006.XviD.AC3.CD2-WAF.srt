163
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:36,175
Otherwise, it's downtown
and a whole lot of publicity.

164
00:09:47,287 --> 00:09:49,050
This is all a fluke.

165
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:51,350
I met them at LaVerne's
last fall.

166
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:54,120
Betty, maybe one time.
Lorna, a couple.

167
00:09:54,227 --> 00:09:57,685
They'd come in
to cadge a drink
or a meal off a sister.

168
00:09:58,665 --> 00:10:00,963
So why'd you rabbit
last night?

169
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:03,695
Mister,
my father is Emmett Linscott.

170
00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:07,902
The Emmett Linscott?

171
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:10,707
He built half of Hollywood
and Long Beach.

172
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:12,642
Imagine the headlines,

173

"Construction Tycoors

in Dahlia Case.

174

"Footsie

175

Get the picture?

Technicolor.

177
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:24,713
So what'd you talk about?

178
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:27,017
When?

179
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:28,788
When you were playing footsie.

180
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:37,801
Lorna talked about her stupid
boyfriend back in Hicktown,
Nebraska, or wherever.

181
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:41,664
Betty talked about the latest
issue of Screen World.

182
00:10:42,775 --> 00:10:46,176
Starlets, Hollywood dreams,
the whole sad nine yards.

183
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:49,376
So, did Betty ever tell you
about a movie she was in?

184
00:10:49,449 --> 00:10:52,941
On a conversational level,
they were right up there
with you.

185
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:55,044
Cute. Answer the question.

186
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:59,780
Look, I'm tired.
Do you want my alibi
so I can go home?

187
00:11:01,027 --> 00:11:02,119
Sure.

188
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:07,599
My family and I were in Laguna
from Sunday through Thursday,
along with the servants.

189

If you want verification,

191
00:11:18,077 --> 00:11:19,066
So,

192
00:11:21,147 --> 00:11:23,980
what do I have to do to keep
my name out of the papers?

193
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:25,677
What do you mean?

194
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:28,979
That's not very convincing.

195
00:11:30,557 --> 00:11:33,526
I don't need
your Daddy's money,
if that's what you're saying.

196
00:11:33,593 --> 00:11:35,720
You know it's not
what I'm saying.

197
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:40,889
I might be convinced.

198
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:44,899
Tomorrow night, 8:00.

I know the address.

00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:51,208
Not surprised.

not like a cop.

Oh, one more thing.

00:11:57,951 --> 00:11:59,111
What's your name?

206
00:11:59,185 --> 00:12:00,379
Bucky Bleichert.

207
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:01,442
Bucky?

208
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:04,881
I'll try to remember.

Yes, I understand.
A werewolf and Red Sheridan.

What if the werewolf
is Red Sheridan?

214
00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:25,109
Yes, that would be
more efficient.

215

217
00:12:31,784 --> 00:12:33,046
Not good.

218

You mind if I bunk out

Sure.

Look, I didn't know
you were a boxer.

Daddy's heard of you
and he insists
you stay for dinner.

I told him
we met at that art exhibit

Balto.

236
00:14:37,777 --> 00:14:41,611
The paper is the L.A. Times
for August 1, 1926.

237
00:14:42,115 --> 00:14:43,582
Balto was bringing in
the paper

when Daddy found out
he made his first million.

He wanted to consecrate
the moment,

240
00:14:49,822 --> 00:14:51,346
so he shot him.

241

I'll get it, Daddy.
Okay, darling.

Mondo gave a good show.
Whatever happened to him?

Heroin overdose.

Too bad.

257
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:34,596
He shamed his family.

Maddy's my pretty one,
but Martha's
my certified genius.

272
00:16:25,718 --> 00:16:27,948
What kind of a name
is Bleichert? Dutch?

273
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,214
German.

274
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:32,116
A great people, the Germans.

275
00:16:32,425 --> 00:16:34,518
Hitler was a bit excessive.

276
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:36,918
But mark my words
that someday we'll regret

277
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:39,988
not joining forces with him
to fight the Reds.

278
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:43,795
You know,
I killed a lot of your

met Balto in the hallway?

00:16:47,473 --> 00:16:49,202
Yes. Very realistic.

stuffed him.

We were in the Scots Regiment
together. Georgie Tilden.

283
00:16:53,813 --> 00:16:55,371
He wanted to work
in the flickers.

284
00:16:55,448 --> 00:16:56,472
When did you move here?

285
00:16:56,549 --> 00:16:57,607
1920.

286
00:16:57,683 --> 00:17:01,278
Hollywood was a cow pasture
but the silent flickers
were booming.

287
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:03,788
Georgie got work
as a lighting man,
me building houses.

288
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:06,290
Georgie introduced me
to Mack Sennett.

289
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:08,293
I helped him build
that housing project
he was putting up

290
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:10,295
underneath
that god-awful sign.

291
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:11,521
Hollywoodland.

292
00:17:11,597 --> 00:17:12,791
I used to love
the Keystone Kops.

293
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:14,594
Me, too.

294
00:17:14,667 --> 00:17:17,465
Old Mack knew how
to squeeze a dollar dry.

295
00:17:18,804 --> 00:17:22,240
He had extras moonlighting
as laborers and vice versa.

296
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,539
Georgie and I used to drive
them over to Hollywoodland

297
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:26,009
after 12 hours
on a silent flicker.

298
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:29,445
Then put in another six hours
by torchlight.

299
00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:32,609
He even gave us movie credits
a couple of times.

300
00:17:36,856 --> 00:17:38,050
EMMETT: Mother.

301
00:17:38,658 --> 00:17:40,421
Are you feeling well?

302
00:17:40,493 --> 00:17:43,656
Would you like to contribute
to the conversation?

303
00:17:48,334 --> 00:17:51,428
Did you know, Mr. Bleichert,

304
00:17:53,706 --> 00:17:56,436
that Ramona Boulevard
is named after me?

305
00:17:57,243 --> 00:17:58,505
I didn't.

306
00:17:59,545 --> 00:18:02,742
When Emmett married me,

307
00:18:04,183 --> 00:18:06,048
for my father's money,

308
00:18:07,386 --> 00:18:10,082
he promised my family
that he would use
his influence

309
00:18:10,156 --> 00:18:12,215
with the City Zoning Board

310
00:18:12,325 --> 00:18:14,657
to have a street named
after me.

311
00:18:16,562 --> 00:18:18,462
But all he could manage

312
00:18:19,699 --> 00:18:21,462
was a dead-end block

313
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:24,168
in a red-light district

314
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:27,972
in Lincoln Heights.

315
00:18:29,175 --> 00:18:32,611
Are you familiar with
the neighborhood,
Mr. Bleichert?

316
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:35,471
I grew up there.

317
00:18:40,152 --> 00:18:41,414
Yes, well,

318
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:45,253
then you'll know
that Mexican prostitutes

319
00:18:46,258 --> 00:18:48,453
expose themselves
in windows.

320
00:18:50,296 --> 00:18:54,255
I hear many of them
know Mr. Linscott by name.

321
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:55,957

483
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:55,124
I'm withholding evidence
for you.

484
00:33:57,135 --> 00:33:59,262
It's a fair trade
but it shakes me.

485
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:02,968
Are you sure
there isn't anything

486
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:05,202
you haven't told me
about you and Betty?

487
00:34:14,452 --> 00:34:17,615
Betty and I made love once,
that one time last summer.

488
00:34:24,229 --> 00:34:26,220
I just did it to see
what it would be like

489
00:34:26,298 --> 00:34:27,765
to do it with someone
who looked like me.

490
00:34:27,832 --> 00:34:29,060
Jesus Christ.

491
00:34:36,241 --> 00:34:39,108
Bucky, that's it. I swear.

492
00:34:47,218 --> 00:34:48,845
Bucky, please stay.

493
00:34:52,223 --> 00:34:53,554
You stupid slut.

494
00:34:53,625 --> 00:34:55,183
Stay. Sugar, stay!

495
00:35:23,822 --> 00:35:24,811
Hey.

496
00:35:27,592 --> 00:35:29,082
We're famous, Dwight.

497
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:32,924
Notorious.

498
00:35:34,766 --> 00:35:36,097
Where's Lee?

499
00:35:42,641 --> 00:35:45,007
Bobby DeWitt's
probably in LA. By now.

500
00:35:47,245 --> 00:35:49,338
Lee always said I'd be safe.

501
00:35:51,182 --> 00:35:54,310
You will be. You will be.

502
00:35:59,357 --> 00:36:00,847
He had a sister.

503
00:36:03,128 --> 00:36:04,186
What?

504
00:36:07,532 --> 00:36:09,159
He had a little sister.

505
00:36:09,934 --> 00:36:11,697
She was killed
when Lee was 15,

506
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:13,761
and they never
caught the guy.

507
00:36:18,677 --> 00:36:19,769
Why...

508
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:22,741
Why didn't you tell me
this before?

509
00:36:22,814 --> 00:36:25,078
He made me promise
never to tell you.

510
00:36:26,718 --> 00:36:29,118
He thought it made him
too easy to figure.

511
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:31,348
Well, it sure explains
some things.

512
00:36:32,824 --> 00:36:34,189
No, it doesn't.

513
00:36:34,259 --> 00:36:35,590
Kay, where's Lee?

514
00:36:38,997 --> 00:36:41,022
If you know,
you should tell me.

515
00:36:44,335 --> 00:36:47,498
Kay,
Bobby DeWitt just got out.

516
00:36:48,373 --> 00:36:49,965
Lee's all hopped up
on Benzedrine,

517
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:52,305
so what do you
think is going to happen?

518
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:57,008
Where is he?

519
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:07,722
Morrie Friedman called
a couple of hours ago.

520
00:37:08,426 --> 00:37:10,121
The guy from New Year's?

521
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:14,057
Bobby's got a drug deal
somewhere

522
00:37:14,833 --> 00:37:17,097
in a building Friedman owns,
the Olympic, I think.

523
00:37:17,168 --> 00:37:18,157
When?

524
00:37:23,508 --> 00:37:24,907
Now.
Jesus.

525
00:37:24,976 --> 00:37:26,102
Dwight.

526

(DOOR CLOSING)

(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

528
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:15,520
Bobby DeWitt?

529
00:38:15,927 --> 00:38:17,053
Get your hands up.

530
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:18,720
Get up against that wall
over there.

531
00:38:18,797 --> 00:38:20,958
Keep your hands
where I can see them.

532
00:38:21,032 --> 00:38:22,465
Jesus.

533
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:38,175
I ain't out one week, and...

534
00:38:40,485 --> 00:38:42,953
You're here for a drug deal
with Morrie Friedman.
I know that.

535
00:38:43,021 --> 00:38:45,216
Look, I'm just looking
for a place to take a piss.

536
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:47,485
Lee Blanchard's here.
Did you know that?
Blanchard?

537
00:38:47,559 --> 00:38:50,722
Man-oh-Manischewitz,
I ain't seen Blanchard
since my fucking trial.

538
00:38:50,795 --> 00:38:52,262
Yeah,
but he's been on your mind.

539
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:53,797
And you've been on his mind.

540
00:38:53,865 --> 00:38:56,993
I'm thinking that you let
the word out there knowing
he'd come down here.

541
00:38:57,068 --> 00:39:00,265
Look, maybe
I flapped my trap at trial.
Maybe I was thinking revenge,

542
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:01,896
maybe talking trash
to my cellies,

543
00:39:01,973 --> 00:39:03,838
but all I know is
what I read in the papers,

544
00:39:03,908 --> 00:39:06,536
and when that fucker
killed them niggers...

545
00:39:06,611 --> 00:39:07,703
Finish up.

546
00:39:07,779 --> 00:39:09,838
I don't know
what his version is.
What's your version?

547
00:39:09,914 --> 00:39:11,677
Sir, all this between
me and Blanchard

548
00:39:11,749 --> 00:39:14,343
is that I fucked this
big-tittied Dakota cunt
named Kay Lake...

549
00:39:14,419 --> 00:39:15,647
