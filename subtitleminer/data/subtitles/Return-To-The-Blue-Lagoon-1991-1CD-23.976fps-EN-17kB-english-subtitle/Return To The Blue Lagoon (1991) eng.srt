1
00:02:55,433 --> 00:02:59,812
Small boat adrift! Starboard bow!

2
00:03:03,941 --> 00:03:06,235
Look! Off starboard!

3
00:03:19,415 --> 00:03:22,335
Up into the wind!
Get out the small boat!

4
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,713
- Pull away!
- Pull away!

5
00:03:26,005 --> 00:03:27,548
Easy!

6
00:03:27,757 --> 00:03:30,051
Get that genny out!

7
00:03:54,659 --> 00:03:56,786
- Anyone aboard?
- I can't tell!

8
00:03:57,161 --> 00:04:00,915
Get that painter!
Pull that line, Kearney!

9
00:04:01,124 --> 00:04:03,793
Come on, get that boat in!

10
00:04:05,461 --> 00:04:06,838
Watch the sides!

11
00:04:07,088 --> 00:04:09,424
There's a man and a woman, sir!

12
00:04:09,674 --> 00:04:13,011
- Dead or alive?
- Dead, sir!

13
00:04:13,845 --> 00:04:16,931
- A child, sir!
- A what?

14
00:04:17,473 --> 00:04:18,725
Alive!

15
00:04:25,815 --> 00:04:29,652
- I'll take him.
- Thank you, ma'am.

16
00:04:40,538 --> 00:04:42,999
There. There, now.

17
00:04:49,213 --> 00:04:54,802
"We commit their bodies to the waters
to be turned into corruption...

18
00:04:55,053 --> 00:04:59,349
...looking for resurrection,
when the sea shall give up her dead...

19
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:05,938
...and the life of the world to come,
through our lord, Jesus Christ. Amen."

20
00:05:31,547 --> 00:05:33,091
Captain.

21
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:37,887
The surgeon would like
to speak with you, sir.

22
00:05:38,513 --> 00:05:40,765
There's sickness in the crew.

23
00:05:41,015 --> 00:05:44,268
Five more were taken down
since mid-watch.

24
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:46,229
Fever. Canker sores.

25
00:05:46,437 --> 00:05:49,273
Your cabinet has bromide.
Leech it out.

26
00:05:49,524 --> 00:05:51,317
It's beyond bleeding.

27
00:05:51,859 --> 00:05:55,780
Mr. Penfield,
I look to your medical knowledge.

28
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:59,784
After we left Moorea,
you thought it was scurvy.

29
00:06:00,034 --> 00:06:02,578
Then you said it was breakbone fever.

30
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:06,165
The symptoms weren't for certain.
Now, I know.

31
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:09,585
Fever. Withered skin.

32
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:12,296
Black bile.

33
00:06:16,426 --> 00:06:18,553
Cholera.

34
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:32,734
- Can't we turn back?
- There's no port for a plague ship.

35
00:06:32,942 --> 00:06:37,739
- Drop anchor at the first island.
- This is all open sea.

36
00:06:37,947 --> 00:06:42,744
With due respect, captain, that small
boat put off from somewheres.

37
00:06:44,203 --> 00:06:49,375
This is a French naval chart.
There's nothing but warnings.

38
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:52,795
There's reefs. Atolls.

39
00:06:54,630 --> 00:07:00,970
This is a cruel turn for Mrs. Hargraves.
Left widowed with an infant.

40
00:07:01,262 --> 00:07:03,765
Cast them adrift.

41
00:07:05,266 --> 00:07:10,313
- A woman alone with two children?
- Put a man with them.

42
00:07:10,563 --> 00:07:12,523
Kearney's strong and able.

43
00:07:12,774 --> 00:07:15,360
At least that'll give them a chance.

44
00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:17,779
Kearney?

45
00:07:19,655 --> 00:07:22,325
Best of a poor lot.

46
00:07:23,618 --> 00:07:26,704
But keep it from the rest of the crew.

47
00:07:26,954 --> 00:07:29,624
- Wait till mid-watch.
- Aye, sir.

48
00:07:32,627 --> 00:07:37,256
Putting us off into the peril
of the sea because some men are ill?

49
00:07:37,465 --> 00:07:40,468
- This is madness!
- It's for your own good.

50
00:07:40,718 --> 00:07:44,847
I've spent the last three years
in a climate of awful heat...

51
00:07:45,056 --> 00:07:48,059
...with insects as big as rats,
rats as big as cats!

52
00:07:48,267 --> 00:07:52,480
I can certainly deal with some
deck hands down with fever!

53
00:07:53,189 --> 00:07:58,403
We're carrying cholera.
If you stay aboard, you'll die.

54
00:07:58,653 --> 00:08:03,825
You can't take your sea chest, missus.
Only things you really need.

55
00:08:04,283 --> 00:08:07,954
But everything we have
will be in this chest.

56
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:12,166
Mrs. Hargraves will be taking
her belongings.

57
00:08:12,417 --> 00:08:14,293
Aye, sir.

58
00:08:18,256 --> 00:08:19,632
Cholera?

59
00:09:37,085 --> 00:09:41,798
Mr. Kearney?
Mr. Kearney, a cup of water, please.

60
00:09:42,674 --> 00:09:47,220
- There's only so much, missus.
- They're in sore need, Mr. Kearney.

61
00:09:48,137 --> 00:09:52,058
Look, the boy ain't yours,
so he don't matter too much.

62
00:09:52,308 --> 00:09:54,519
Your infant knows what to do.

63
00:09:54,977 --> 00:09:59,607
I'd say you're fresh. Let her suckle.

64
00:10:58,416 --> 00:11:02,128
I tell you, I'm sick and tired
of them two squalling.

65
00:11:02,378 --> 00:11:04,756
Then give them water.

66
00:11:05,465 --> 00:11:08,301
I'm a practical man, missus.

67
00:11:08,593 --> 00:11:12,638
If I was alone, by myself,
this could last a good while.

68
00:11:14,682 --> 00:11:18,019
Sharing four ways makes no sense.

69
00:11:19,228 --> 00:11:22,148
It's best to put them out
of their misery.

70
00:11:22,607 --> 00:11:25,443
You won't touch them.

71
00:11:26,694 --> 00:11:30,448
You either shut them up,
or they're going overboard!

72
00:11:30,698 --> 00:11:32,825
Hush, Lilli!

73
00:11:47,215 --> 00:11:51,052
That's it. Look the other way
if you don't want to see.

74
00:15:07,081 --> 00:15:11,377
Richard, come quickly. Jump up.

75
00:16:01,636 --> 00:16:03,596
You can help Mama.

76
00:16:03,805 --> 00:16:06,974
Yeah, that's my girl.

77
00:16:07,225 --> 00:16:08,935
Yes.

78
00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:11,813
Come on. Come on, Lilli.

79
00:17:09,287 --> 00:17:12,540
Richard, you stay here.

80
00:17:18,504 --> 00:17:20,631
It's fresh.

81
00:17:27,972 --> 00:17:30,892
Look! Bananas!

82
00:17:31,142 --> 00:17:36,564
And pompons! And roots!
Roots are good eating!

83
00:17:41,069 --> 00:17:44,655
This is taro root!
We ate it at the mission.

84
00:17:44,864 --> 00:17:48,201
And bananas.
Richard, here's some bananas!

85
00:17:48,409 --> 00:17:52,538
Yes, lots of bananas!

86
00:17:53,665 --> 00:17:54,666
Boat.

87
00:17:54,916 --> 00:17:57,585
Here, do you want some?

88
00:17:59,379 --> 00:18:01,589
The boat is coming.

89
00:18:06,969 --> 00:18:08,596
Boat!

90
00:18:09,889 --> 00:18:13,226
Look! How pretty.

91
00:18:17,313 --> 00:18:18,439
There.

92
00:18:20,441 --> 00:18:22,735
Oh, Lilli.

93
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:02,168
We can't stay here.

94
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:05,213
We're too exposed on this side.

95
00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:12,011
We've got to find a safe haven out
of the weather. Come on.

96
00:20:12,261 --> 00:20:16,474
Come, Richard.
Let's go for a little walk.

97
00:20:25,191 --> 00:20:27,318
Here we go.

98
00:21:15,491 --> 00:21:19,203
Look! How beautiful!

99
00:21:23,624 --> 00:21:25,501
House.

100
00:21:31,549 --> 00:21:34,635
Good heavens! Richard!

101
00:21:40,433 --> 00:21:42,393
Mama!

102
00:22:09,629 --> 00:22:12,006
Mama! Mama!

103
00:22:26,062 --> 00:22:28,898
She's gone.

104
00:22:29,107 --> 00:22:33,069
I know she's gone. Your mama's gone.

105
00:22:35,947 --> 00:22:40,493
It's all right. It's all right.
Come here, I've got you.

106
00:22:40,702 --> 00:22:45,581
- Mommy gone!
- I know. It's all right.

107
00:22:46,541 --> 00:22:52,213
Your mama's not here, but I am.
I'll be your mama from now on.

108
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:03,224
Any passing ship will see this
when it's ablaze.

109
00:23:03,474 --> 00:23:07,061
It won't be long before one finds us.

110
00:23:39,719 --> 00:23:43,139
Go to sleep now. Close your eyes.

111
00:23:47,393 --> 00:23:49,771
I'll be right back.

112
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:03,720
I know this is your favourite dessert,
but eat slower.

113
00:25:04,012 --> 00:25:09,225
And hold the spoon this way,
as I've showed you.

114
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:16,524
Someday, you'll find yourself seated
at a fancy table in San Francisco...

115
00:25:16,774 --> 00:25:20,445
...and be expected
to show proper table manners.

116
00:25:22,613 --> 00:25:24,866
Richard! Don't do that!

117
00:25:34,667 --> 00:25:40,173
We may be away from civilization,
but we won't behave uncivilized!

118
00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:57,357
Full moon!

119
00:26:10,536 --> 00:26:14,290
They come every three months
when the moon is full.

120
00:26:17,126 --> 00:26:20,380
Off to bed, children. Quickly!

121
00:26:21,005 --> 00:26:23,132
Richard, come!

122
00:26:24,926 --> 00:26:30,139
Lt'll be all right. Tonight
you'll get your lullaby in the dark.

123
00:28:08,112 --> 00:28:10,239
The mother!

124
00:28:24,587 --> 00:28:26,297
Put it down!

125
00:28:36,849 --> 00:28:40,978
- Why do you wear clothes when bathing?
- It's proper.

126
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:45,900
- Why don't Richard and I wear clothes?
- I gave up on you long ago.

127
00:28:46,150 --> 00:28:49,737
I put your clothes on
and you'd just take them off.

128
00:28:50,029 --> 00:28:52,949
- I wish I looked like him down there.
- Why?

129
00:28:53,199 --> 00:28:58,162
- He can aim when he goes:
- I can hit a mango leaf dead centre.

130
00:28:59,914 --> 00:29:03,835
Why does he have one he can aim
and we don't?

131
00:29:04,377 --> 00:29:08,423
God, in his infinite wisdom,
decided...

132
00:29:10,258 --> 00:29:14,470
Well, nature gave us different parts.

133
00:29:16,139 --> 00:29:18,891
- You see, a female has a...
- A cowrie shell.

134
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:23,146
- What?
- Lilli looks like a cowrie shell there.

135
00:29:23,396 --> 00:29:26,899
So that's what you call mine,
a cowrie shell.

136
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:31,779
- And we call Richard's a...
- No, no, no! Never mind.

137
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:37,118
I should have explained certain
of life's facts to you years ago.

138
00:29:37,368 --> 00:29:43,708
- Explain certain of life's facts now.
- No, I need to think about it first.

139
00:29:43,916 --> 00:29:47,628
I'll explain it after your
spelling lesson tonight.

140
00:29:47,879 --> 00:29:50,340
- Let's rinse off.
- Tonight?

141
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:52,467
All right? Everybody.

142
00:29:59,349 --> 00:30:02,018
Why do people get married?

143
00:30:02,268 --> 00:30:06,105
God commanded that when a man
and woman love each other...

144
00:30:06,356 --> 00:30:09,942
...they take vows.
Vows are like promises.

145
00:30:10,193 --> 00:30:14,322
They make promises to each other
in the eyes of God.

146
00:30:14,572 --> 00:30:17,992
And that's called
the marriage ceremony.

147
00:30:18,201 --> 00:30:21,120
Here's the ceremony
your father used to say...

148
00:30:21,329 --> 00:30:24,999
...when he performed marriages
at the mission.

149
00:30:25,833 --> 00:30:27,877
What about the life facts?

150
00:30:37,011 --> 00:30:41,474
When a girl becomes a woman,
and a boy becomes a man...

151
00:30:41,683 --> 00:30:45,728
- When's that?
- Well, it's different for everyone...

152
00:30:45,978 --> 00:30:50,024
...but you'll know when it happens.
- How?

153
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:56,239
Lilli, your body will become rounder.
You'll grow breasts like mine.

154
00:30:56,489 --> 00:30:59,409
And you'll bleed a bit
from between your legs.

155
00:30:59,617 --> 00:31:02,286
I don't wanna bleed.

156
00:31:02,954 --> 00:31:04,914
It only lasts a few days.

157
00:31:05,164 --> 00:31:10,211
And it's a great blessing
because it means you can have a baby.

158
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:17,176
- Do I have to bleed?
- No. But your body will change too.

159
00:31:17,427 --> 00:31:21,014
Your voice gets deeper.
Hair will grow on your face.

160
00:31:21,264 --> 00:31:26,060
You'd look handsome with a beard.
Unless you want to scrape it off.

161
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:30,857
- I want the baby now.
- You can't. You're not ready yet.

162
00:31:31,107 --> 00:31:34,736
Also, you need the man
to make the baby inside you.

163
00:31:34,986 --> 00:31:37,113
Inside me?

164
00:31:37,363 --> 00:31:40,616
Yes. There's a special place
inside a woman...

165
00:31:40,867 --> 00:31:44,746
...where the baby stays nice
and warm and safe...

166
00:31:45,038 --> 00:31:48,624
...until it's ready
to be born into the world.

167
00:31:48,833 --> 00:31:51,294
How does the baby get in there?

168
00:31:52,587 --> 00:31:54,464
Well...

169
00:31:54,672 --> 00:32:00,094
...after they're married,
the man and woman lie very...

170
00:32:00,303 --> 00:32:05,350
...very close together and... -
- I know. It's like the iguanas, Lilli.

171
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:10,063
You know, when they get so close
you can't tell them apart.

172
00:32:10,271 --> 00:32:12,315
- That's it.
- That's it?

173
00:32:12,774 --> 00:32:15,943
Yes. Iguanas have
their babies soon after.

174
00:32:16,444 --> 00:32:21,324
- That's it, Mother?
- Well, that's most of it.

175
00:32:21,574 --> 00:32:26,371
That's what I've been waiting
to hear all day?

176
00:34:31,954 --> 00:34:37,210
- That's not gonna help.
- Look what you did to my spear. Go away.

177
00:34:37,418 --> 00:34:40,922
That was my fish.
Go back out where you belong.

178
00:34:41,130 --> 00:34:44,926
Richard, look.
Now what are we gonna do?

179
00:34:45,134 --> 00:34:48,304
What are we gonna do now, Richard?

180
00:34:48,721 --> 00:34:53,685
- What are we gonna do?
- Will you be quiet and let me think?

181
00:35:10,326 --> 00:35:12,620
Lilli!

182
00:35:14,497 --> 00:35:16,958
Richard!

183
00:35:25,591 --> 00:35:28,761
We're out past sunset.
Mother's gonna be angry.

184
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:35,309
- What are you doing?
- I've got an idea.

185
00:36:12,055 --> 00:36:14,265
He's coming. Come on!

186
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:07,110
Where have you been?
Do you realize how late it is?

187
00:37:07,318 --> 00:37:13,324
But there was this old shark in the
channel. He took Richard's spear.

188
00:37:13,533 --> 00:37:16,786
I told you to keep away from sharks.

189
00:37:17,370 --> 00:37:20,206
- Boat drifted loose.
- What are the rules?

190
00:37:20,415 --> 00:37:22,792
- Be home by sunset always.
- And?

191
00:37:23,001 --> 00:37:27,922
- Never to the north side of the island.
- Do you see that? A full moon!

192
00:37:28,172 --> 00:37:33,386
We are going straight home and this is
never happening again. Do you hear me?

193
00:38:16,262 --> 00:38:21,851
Oh! Lilli, Richard.
Go get some thatch.

194
00:39:01,099 --> 00:39:04,018
Get back inside.

195
00:39:46,144 --> 00:39:49,647
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

196
00:39:49,814 --> 00:39:54,110
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven.

197
00:39:54,319 --> 00:39:59,198
Give us this day our daily bread.
Forgive us our trespasses as we...

198
00:39:59,365 --> 00:40:05,371
...forgive those who trespass against
us. Lead us not into temptation...

199
00:40:05,538 --> 00:40:12,170
...but deliver us from evil. For thine is
the kingdom, power and glory forever.

200
00:40:20,011 --> 00:40:24,140
I can feel that the sickness has moved
into my lungs now.

201
00:40:24,349 --> 00:40:28,269
And that means I might not get well.

202
00:40:29,270 --> 00:40:31,647
What's going to happen?

203
00:40:32,690 --> 00:40:35,943
You may have to be here without me.

204
00:40:36,194 --> 00:40:37,987
If God wants...

205
00:40:38,154 --> 00:40:44,410
...l'll be with your father and we'll
be guardian angels watching over you.

206
00:40:46,913 --> 00:40:49,832
This is my special place.

207
00:40:50,041 --> 00:40:54,420
It's quiet here,
and I can see the house.

208
00:40:58,633 --> 00:41:03,721
Hollow out this ground about so deep.

209
00:41:03,930 --> 00:41:07,767
And line it with thatch and moss.

210
00:41:07,975 --> 00:41:10,895
Then fill it in...

211
00:41:11,062 --> 00:41:14,315
...and smooth it over with earth.

212
00:41:16,234 --> 00:41:19,487
I'll write out a prayer for you to say.

213
00:41:19,696 --> 00:41:23,908
We'll carve a marker and it will say:

214
00:41:24,409 --> 00:41:27,495
"Here lies Sarah Hargraves.

215
00:41:27,704 --> 00:41:33,543
Wife of William, mother of Lillian..."

216
00:41:36,671 --> 00:41:39,757
And I know I'm not your
real mother, Richard.

217
00:41:40,008 --> 00:41:42,927
But I would like to have it said:

218
00:41:43,136 --> 00:41:46,806
"And mother of Richard."

219
00:42:10,038 --> 00:42:14,751
We pray the Lord to grant
this last abiding wish.

220
00:42:14,959 --> 00:42:20,173
That Lilli and Richard love each other,
take care of each other...

221
00:42:20,381 --> 00:42:24,135
...and keep up with their lessons...

222
00:42:24,385 --> 00:42:29,724
...and be prepared for the
ship when it comes. Amen.

223
00:44:09,532 --> 00:44:12,869
- Breakfast looks extra good today.
- Thank you.

224
00:44:13,077 --> 00:44:18,499
- Don't forget, you cook tomorrow.
- You're the one who always forgets.

225
00:44:18,666 --> 00:44:24,005
- What? What do I forget?
- To colour your eggs for the hunt.

226
00:44:24,213 --> 00:44:28,259
I didn't forget. I don't think
we should do it this year.

227
00:44:28,718 --> 00:44:30,678
But we do it every Easter.

228
00:44:30,887 --> 00:44:35,683
The calendar marks say tomorrow's
Easter, so we must have the hunt.

229
00:44:36,768 --> 00:44:38,061
Why?

230
00:44:38,269 --> 00:44:41,856
How else do we know who finds
the most eggs and wins?

231
00:44:41,981 --> 00:44:45,485
- Wins what, Richard?
- I don't know.

232
00:44:45,693 --> 00:44:48,946
Nothing. Just wins.

233
00:44:49,197 --> 00:44:54,619
It seems silly to me. I don't
understand why we have to do it.

234
00:44:56,245 --> 00:44:58,706
Because Mother would want us to.

235
00:45:06,506 --> 00:45:12,345
I've got an idea. Whoever finds
the most eggs this year wins a prize.

236
00:45:12,553 --> 00:45:14,263
What kind of a prize?

237
00:45:14,430 --> 00:45:17,517
If you win,
I've gotta give you something.

238
00:45:17,725 --> 00:45:21,145
And if I win,
you've gotta give me something.

239
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:27,193
It's a wonderful idea.

240
00:45:27,402 --> 00:45:31,239
I hid ten eggs between
the beach and the berry patch.

241
00:45:31,406 --> 00:45:34,158
I hid ten between the rocks
and the fern glade.

242
00:45:34,367 --> 00:45:38,746
- Ready?
- Ready. Get set. Go!

243
00:46:22,206 --> 00:46:25,043
I found nine. Beat that.

244
00:46:25,752 --> 00:46:30,214
- I only found eight.
- The winner's me. Where's my prize?

245
00:47:19,806 --> 00:47:23,142
You were down so long.
What were you doing?

246
00:47:23,309 --> 00:47:25,019
You'll see.

247
00:47:50,670 --> 00:47:52,797
Your prize!

248
00:49:03,201 --> 00:49:05,953
I'm gonna keep this forever.

249
00:49:07,955 --> 00:49:12,835
My prize. The white bead.

250
00:49:14,128 --> 00:49:18,925
I think it looks nice in my hair.

251
00:49:19,133 --> 00:49:20,510
Do you?

252
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:25,139
I don't care what you do with it...

253
00:49:25,348 --> 00:49:28,017
...or how you wear it.

254
00:49:28,226 --> 00:49:31,646
You can hang it from your nose
for all I care.

255
00:50:45,053 --> 00:50:47,638
Back and forth.

256
00:50:48,014 --> 00:50:52,477
Round and round.
You think this whole reef is yours.

257
00:50:52,643 --> 00:50:56,397
You think you can swallow
anything that swims.

258
00:50:56,564 --> 00:50:59,233
You'd like to catch me, wouldn't you?

259
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:05,239
But I was too fast, stupid sea slug.
I can beat you every time.

260
00:51:05,448 --> 00:51:10,495
And if you don't believe me,
I'll prove it!

261
00:51:37,730 --> 00:51:41,859
Master of the reef!

262
00:51:48,533 --> 00:51:53,496
The first time, he almost got me.
But I was too fast for him.

263
00:51:53,746 --> 00:51:57,500
This time, he was lying in wait.

264
00:51:57,709 --> 00:52:00,628
So I dive in,
and I can see down his mouth.

265
00:52:00,837 --> 00:52:04,507
There's about 500 teeth.
There's fish around his gills.

266
00:52:04,716 --> 00:52:06,926
And he comes at me.

267
00:52:07,802 --> 00:52:11,389
He misses me. Stupid sea slug!

268
00:52:12,098 --> 00:52:18,646
- It seems silly to me.
- Silly? It's not silly. It's dangerous.

269
00:52:18,896 --> 00:52:24,319
Exactly. That's why it's silly.
I don't understand why you do it.

270
00:52:24,527 --> 00:52:27,363
- I like the way it makes me feel
- What?

271
00:52:27,530 --> 00:52:34,162
Inside here. It feels all alive when
I know I'm the master of the reef.

272
00:52:34,412 --> 00:52:37,749
"The master of the reef.
The master of the reef."

273
00:52:37,915 --> 00:52:41,169
Hey, don't you ever make fun of me.

274
00:52:41,753 --> 00:52:44,130
I'm sorry.

275
00:52:46,174 --> 00:52:51,846
Besides, you're the silly one. Always
touching and looking at yourself.

276
00:52:52,972 --> 00:52:56,059
- I don't touch myself.
- Yes, you do.

277
00:52:56,351 --> 00:53:00,188
You're always touching those
when you look in the mirror.

278
00:53:00,396 --> 00:53:03,232
I'm just measuring
how much they've grown.

279
00:53:03,399 --> 00:53:07,445
- You shouldn't look when I'm naked.
- Why not?

280
00:53:07,612 --> 00:53:11,032
- I always used to see you naked.
- It's different now.

281
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:13,701
- Why?
- I don't know.

282
00:53:13,868 --> 00:53:17,038
I don't know why it's different,
but it is.

283
00:53:17,246 --> 00:53:18,247
Lilli?

284
00:53:26,297 --> 00:53:29,550
I wish things could be
the way they used to be.

285
00:53:29,717 --> 00:53:32,470
When we had fun.

286
00:53:34,263 --> 00:53:37,183
Remember the seesaw she made us?

287
00:53:38,935 --> 00:53:41,062
The games we used to play?

288
00:53:45,316 --> 00:53:48,069
Ring around the rosy?

289
00:54:29,444 --> 00:54:31,404
Richard?

290
00:54:32,905 --> 00:54:34,866
Yes?

291
00:54:37,035 --> 00:54:43,583
You wouldn't mind if I moved my bed
to another part of the house?

292
00:54:46,419 --> 00:54:48,463
No.

293
00:54:49,630 --> 00:54:52,550
If you weren't gonna do it, I was.

294
00:56:50,376 --> 00:56:52,503
How long have you been there?

295
00:56:52,712 --> 00:56:55,465
I saw the blood on the quilt.

296
00:56:57,342 --> 00:56:59,302
Are you all right?

297
00:57:04,599 --> 00:57:06,726
Do you remember?

298
00:57:07,894 --> 00:57:11,939
What Mother said would happen
when I became a woman?

299
00:57:13,107 --> 00:57:14,192
Yes.

300
00:57:15,401 --> 00:57:17,362
Well...

301
00:57:17,612 --> 00:57:19,906
...l've become one.

302
00:57:36,881 --> 00:57:38,675
Richard, wake up!

303
00:57:39,342 --> 00:57:41,469
Richard?

304
00:57:43,179 --> 00:57:45,765
Richard! Richard, wake up.

305
00:57:45,973 --> 00:57:49,394
I can't sleep with my bed
facing the wrong way.

306
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:51,938
- Soon as I'm awake.
- You are. Come...

307
00:57:52,146 --> 00:57:55,817
No, I'm not. Stop it.
Let go, I'm not dressed.

308
00:57:55,984 --> 00:57:59,237
Wrap the quilt around you.

309
00:58:01,614 --> 00:58:04,075
Come on!

310
00:58:07,787 --> 00:58:12,000
- What's wrong? You're humped over.
- Just give me a minute.

311
00:58:12,208 --> 00:58:16,045
- What happened to it?
- It gets that way all the time now.

312
00:58:16,254 --> 00:58:18,840
- Well, does it hurt?
- No.

313
00:58:19,674 --> 00:58:21,801
Well, can you walk?

314
00:58:22,010 --> 00:58:26,305
I can walk just fine.
I can make it go away if I want to.

315
00:58:26,472 --> 00:58:28,516
- How?
- None of your business.

316
00:58:28,725 --> 00:58:31,561
If we keep secrets,
nothing will be the...

317
00:58:31,769 --> 00:58:36,858
Nothing's the same around here anyway.
Nothing's the way it used to be!

318
00:58:37,233 --> 00:58:40,486
Come on, let's move your stupid bed.

319
00:58:55,209 --> 00:58:57,086
Mother.

320
00:58:57,879 --> 00:59:00,631
I don't know what to do.

321
00:59:01,632 --> 00:59:05,386
He's changed, I've changed.

322
00:59:06,471 --> 00:59:09,807
Everything's so confusing.

323
00:59:11,309 --> 00:59:16,189
- I'm tired of you snooping. Go!
- I'm sick of you telling me to go away.

324
00:59:16,356 --> 00:59:17,815
Go away! I mean it.

325
00:59:17,982 --> 00:59:21,944
I'll go where I've always wanted to go,
to the north side.

326
00:59:22,153 --> 00:59:24,364
No! We're in a full moon.

327
00:59:24,530 --> 00:59:27,784
- I can do what I want.
- You can't. It's a rule!

328
00:59:27,992 --> 00:59:32,538
It's not my rule! It was her rule!
She wasn't even my real mother!

329
00:59:32,747 --> 00:59:36,084
- She loved you like a real mother.
- I don't care.

330
00:59:36,250 --> 00:59:41,339
I'm sick of the rules. From now on,
I can do whatever I want to do.

331
00:59:41,547 --> 00:59:45,343
I'm old enough. I can go
wherever I wanna go...

332
00:59:45,551 --> 00:59:48,054
...and come home when I want to.

333
01:04:49,564 --> 01:04:53,318
Richard? Richard?

334
01:04:53,526 --> 01:04:56,529
What happened? What have you done?

335
01:04:56,696 --> 01:04:59,157
I had to hide.

336
01:04:59,324 --> 01:05:02,827
These heathens danced around me.
They didn't see me.

337
01:05:02,994 --> 01:05:05,663
If they had, I would've been dead.

338
01:05:20,345 --> 01:05:22,597
There was this one heathen...

339
01:05:22,805 --> 01:05:25,642
...and at first, I wanted to kill him.

340
01:05:25,808 --> 01:05:30,938
And then, I didn't want to kill him.
And then, I couldn't kill him.

341
01:05:31,105 --> 01:05:34,442
- Then he saw you. He'll tell the others!
- No.

342
01:05:34,651 --> 01:05:38,071
I let him go. Peace.

343
01:05:38,571 --> 01:05:41,574
I hope you're right.
I'm glad you're okay.

344
01:05:41,824 --> 01:05:47,246
I thought I'd never see you again.
I never want us to fight again, ever.

345
01:05:48,164 --> 01:05:49,707
Me neither.

346
01:05:55,004 --> 01:05:56,964
- Lilli?
- Yes?

347
01:05:57,256 --> 01:06:01,469
- Friends?
- Oh, yes. Always.

348
01:06:36,295 --> 01:06:38,965
I feel like crying.

349
01:06:40,508 --> 01:06:41,968
So do I.

350
01:06:44,512 --> 01:06:48,433
- I want us to be husband and wife.
- Yes.

351
01:06:59,777 --> 01:07:02,196
With this ring...

352
01:07:02,989 --> 01:07:05,033
...I thee wed.

353
01:07:07,785 --> 01:07:12,707
With this ring,
I thee wed you, Richard.

354
01:07:13,875 --> 01:07:15,418
- Amen.
- Amen.

355
01:07:19,547 --> 01:07:22,717
- And now we're...
- One.

356
01:07:23,801 --> 01:07:25,345
Forever.

357
01:09:16,456 --> 01:09:17,999
Look.

358
01:09:21,961 --> 01:09:25,131
Lilli, hurry! The signal fire!

359
01:09:51,532 --> 01:09:54,869
What if they're heathens?
I'm frightened.

360
01:09:55,703 --> 01:10:00,500
Maybe we shouldn't light the fire.
Let's see who they are first.

361
01:10:31,656 --> 01:10:33,700
Eight people.

362
01:10:37,996 --> 01:10:42,125
The one in the light covering
may be a woman.

363
01:10:42,625 --> 01:10:44,252
Woman?

364
01:12:11,047 --> 01:12:14,133
Watch them.
They may not be civilized.

365
01:12:14,384 --> 01:12:19,180
Civilized.
C-l-V-l-L-l-Z-l-D.

366
01:12:21,057 --> 01:12:25,353
Remember what Mother said
about a firm handshake.

367
01:12:27,105 --> 01:12:28,481
My name is Richard.

368
01:12:28,690 --> 01:12:31,943
We've been waiting for you
for a long time.

369
01:12:32,652 --> 01:12:36,698
I'm Lilli, and I'm ready
to go back to civilization.

370
01:12:38,199 --> 01:12:39,742
What?

371
01:12:39,993 --> 01:12:43,913
I am Captain Jacob Hilliard,
master of the Tradewind.

372
01:12:44,998 --> 01:12:47,458
And we...
Is this your land?

373
01:12:47,709 --> 01:12:50,211
Yes. My house is there.

374
01:12:50,461 --> 01:12:54,048
We're in need of fresh water.
Our casks are fouled.

375
01:12:55,550 --> 01:12:59,929
Will you grant us permission
to come ashore?

376
01:13:00,179 --> 01:13:03,975
Yes. You are welcome here.

377
01:13:04,892 --> 01:13:07,729
Cover yourself,
and I'll get my daughter.

378
01:13:08,187 --> 01:13:12,317
- Does that binding choke you?
- No, certainly not.

379
01:13:13,735 --> 01:13:15,278
Well, yes, sometimes.

380
01:13:15,528 --> 01:13:18,448
I'd appreciate it if you'd...

381
01:13:25,913 --> 01:13:28,666
How do you catch fish with that spear?

382
01:13:28,875 --> 01:13:31,336
It's not a spear, mate.

383
01:13:31,627 --> 01:13:34,088
- What is it?
- It's a rifle.

384
01:13:34,672 --> 01:13:36,883
Blow a man's head right off.

385
01:13:37,300 --> 01:13:39,510
Castaways! How exciting!

386
01:13:39,802 --> 01:13:43,306
They're an odd mixture of
knowledge and ignorance.

387
01:13:43,556 --> 01:13:48,353
Oh, and their attire
is a little bit...

388
01:13:48,645 --> 01:13:51,481
Well, it's quite sparse.

389
01:14:05,161 --> 01:14:07,038
Is anything wrong?

390
01:14:10,124 --> 01:14:12,960
The colour. It's the same as the sky.

391
01:14:13,252 --> 01:14:15,129
Pure silk.

392
01:14:17,548 --> 01:14:19,342
With my compliments.

393
01:14:23,096 --> 01:14:24,639
And for your brother.

394
01:14:24,931 --> 01:14:28,434
Oh, he's not my brother.
He's my husband.

395
01:14:28,643 --> 01:14:30,103
Your husband?

396
01:14:38,111 --> 01:14:40,571
Mother died six years ago.

397
01:14:41,155 --> 01:14:44,075
- How do you follow the years?
- She taught us.

398
01:14:44,742 --> 01:14:48,079
We know that 12 full moons
are one year.

399
01:14:48,287 --> 01:14:51,708
We have Christmas, Thanksgiving
and Easter.

400
01:14:51,958 --> 01:14:54,877
We're not sure they're
on the right days.

401
01:14:55,253 --> 01:14:57,922
It's amazing, the two of you...

402
01:14:58,172 --> 01:15:01,676
...in this remote, godforsaken place.

403
01:15:02,093 --> 01:15:04,929
Not godforsaken, Captain Hilliard.

404
01:15:05,221 --> 01:15:07,265
Not godforsaken at all.

405
01:15:07,974 --> 01:15:13,021
You do set an excellent table.
My compliments to the chef.

406
01:15:13,313 --> 01:15:15,982
They've made their own dinnerware.

407
01:15:16,441 --> 01:15:20,903
Cups, soup spoons. Ingenious.

408
01:15:25,825 --> 01:15:29,579
- Won't Mr. Quinlan be joining us?
- He's a seafarer...

409
01:15:29,829 --> 01:15:32,665
...and prefers to be by himself.

410
01:15:32,957 --> 01:15:35,960
I see why you've been lost
for so long.

411
01:15:36,252 --> 01:15:41,215
- The charts don't show this island.
- It's a wonder we found you.

412
01:15:42,717 --> 01:15:46,929
Heathens come to the north side
at certain times.

413
01:15:47,847 --> 01:15:50,308
There's a burial ground there.

414
01:15:52,727 --> 01:15:57,523
This is ever so tasty. A great treat
from the slop we eat on the ship.

415
01:15:57,982 --> 01:15:59,150
What is it?

416
01:15:59,400 --> 01:16:01,027
Eel broth.

417
01:16:02,111 --> 01:16:03,738
Eel?

418
01:16:04,030 --> 01:16:06,324
Well, only the broth is eel.

419
01:16:06,616 --> 01:16:09,952
The little white chunks
are sea urchin.

420
01:16:10,203 --> 01:16:14,582
We appreciate your hospitality
and hope we can repay you.

421
01:16:14,832 --> 01:16:16,292
You can.

422
01:16:16,918 --> 01:16:19,420
You can take us back to civilization.

423
01:16:19,629 --> 01:16:23,216
I should think.
It must be awfully boring here.

424
01:16:24,676 --> 01:16:27,095
What is the meaning of "boring"?

425
01:16:27,720 --> 01:16:33,142
Well, boring is when you have
nothing whatever to do.

426
01:16:33,393 --> 01:16:37,522
So you're bored.
Like you must be here.

427
01:16:42,235 --> 01:16:45,655
No. We're never bored.

428
01:16:48,616 --> 01:16:51,452
Boots and a shirt...

429
01:16:51,953 --> 01:16:54,497
...and a coat and trousers.

430
01:16:56,833 --> 01:17:00,169
I'll let Sylvia explain
the female garments.

431
01:17:00,670 --> 01:17:03,339
Well, carry on.

432
01:17:09,262 --> 01:17:10,722
Buttons!

433
01:17:12,348 --> 01:17:15,435
I remember buttons on Mother's dress.

434
01:17:15,685 --> 01:17:17,729
It's Irish lace.

435
01:17:18,146 --> 01:17:23,026
Richard, turn your head.
I'm showing her a foundation garment.

436
01:17:24,319 --> 01:17:27,405
Although there isn't much
you haven't seen.

437
01:17:38,166 --> 01:17:42,712
- What does it do?
- It goes around the waist, like this.

438
01:17:43,254 --> 01:17:45,715
And then cinch the drawstring.

439
01:17:47,508 --> 01:17:52,138
Don't look yet, Richard.
I'm showing Lillian my secrets.

440
01:17:57,018 --> 01:17:58,394
Look.

441
01:17:59,103 --> 01:18:03,316
This is velvet plush.
And these are silver.

442
01:18:04,651 --> 01:18:05,860
So smooth.

443
01:18:13,701 --> 01:18:17,121
Hairbrush and combs. Powder puff.

444
01:18:18,414 --> 01:18:20,708
Rouge and powder.

445
01:18:23,711 --> 01:18:25,588
Lavender water.

446
01:18:27,382 --> 01:18:29,509
Musk-rose perfume.

447
01:18:30,718 --> 01:18:32,512
And a hand mirror.

448
01:18:37,141 --> 01:18:40,144
You're pretty,
except for the hue of your skin.

449
01:18:40,395 --> 01:18:42,271
But we can fix that.

450
01:18:42,730 --> 01:18:44,941
What's wrong with my skin?

451
01:18:45,149 --> 01:18:49,112
It's tainted brown.
We'll lighten it with lemon juice.

452
01:18:49,404 --> 01:18:51,030
Why?

453
01:18:51,990 --> 01:18:57,036
You don't want people to think
you're a field hand, do you?

454
01:18:57,912 --> 01:18:59,789
No.

455
01:19:09,882 --> 01:19:13,511
- Worse than fish fat.
- It's quite costly.

456
01:19:16,180 --> 01:19:17,974
Well, look at you.

457
01:19:18,224 --> 01:19:21,978
You do look handsome
in your boulevard suit.

458
01:19:23,938 --> 01:19:26,232
So handsome.

459
01:21:25,393 --> 01:21:28,813
Do you think I've applied
too much rouge?

460
01:21:29,314 --> 01:21:32,317
No. I think it's beautiful.

461
01:21:33,276 --> 01:21:36,279
Well, thank you, kind sir.

462
01:21:38,656 --> 01:21:40,199
Well...

463
01:21:40,992 --> 01:21:43,828
All powder and paint
with nothing to do.

464
01:21:44,120 --> 01:21:49,792
- We could go outside and count stars.
- Is that what you do here at night?

465
01:21:50,084 --> 01:21:52,128
Sometimes we count stars.

466
01:21:52,378 --> 01:21:54,505
Sometimes we sing.

467
01:21:54,964 --> 01:21:58,134
- Sometimes we mate, sometimes we sleep.
- Mate?!

468
01:21:58,843 --> 01:22:01,763
- Yes.
- Do you mate often?

469
01:22:02,180 --> 01:22:04,599
Whenever we want to.

470
01:22:07,310 --> 01:22:10,730
- Just like that?
- Well, yes. Yes.

471
01:22:11,105 --> 01:22:13,691
Sometimes we dance.
I love to dance.

472
01:22:14,233 --> 01:22:16,527
Let's show Sylvia how we dance.

473
01:22:28,164 --> 01:22:29,707
Come on, you try it.

474
01:22:29,999 --> 01:22:35,338
I don't call that a dance.
It's childish and simple-minded.

475
01:22:35,963 --> 01:22:40,093
- What do you mean?
- Grown people don't dance like that.

476
01:22:42,136 --> 01:22:45,056
Maybe we should learn
a grown-up dance.

477
01:22:45,306 --> 01:22:48,476
- I shall teach you.
- Oh, will you?

478
01:22:49,352 --> 01:22:50,603
It's like this.

479
01:22:50,895 --> 01:22:53,648
It's naughty.
It's the Spanish polka.

480
01:22:58,903 --> 01:23:03,783
Spirit's willing, flesh is weak
Kiss me, darling, on the cheek

481
01:23:07,453 --> 01:23:09,747
Now do it slow.

482
01:23:12,750 --> 01:23:16,879
One, two, three.
One, two, three.

483
01:23:18,548 --> 01:23:21,384
You're a beautiful dancer, Richard.

484
01:23:24,220 --> 01:23:26,264
She must mind her manners.

485
01:23:26,472 --> 01:23:29,809
It's not polite to leave a guest
during a lesson.

486
01:23:30,018 --> 01:23:34,564
Well, we're sorry, but she'll just
have to wait her turn.

487
01:23:45,908 --> 01:23:48,995
She's gonna teach me how to mazurka.

488
01:23:49,454 --> 01:23:52,373
As soon as I get it right,
I'll show you.

489
01:23:52,623 --> 01:23:55,126
You lied to me.

490
01:23:55,460 --> 01:23:57,670
When did I lie to you?

491
01:23:58,546 --> 01:24:01,716
You told me once
that you'd never hurt me.

492
01:24:03,426 --> 01:24:05,053
How did I hurt you?

493
01:24:05,720 --> 01:24:09,223
When you always stare at her,
it hurts me.

494
01:24:09,474 --> 01:24:11,184
I'm sorry.

495
01:24:12,644 --> 01:24:15,647
It's just that she's so different.

496
01:24:17,440 --> 01:24:18,441
In what way?

497
01:24:19,317 --> 01:24:23,154
Well, just look at her.
The way she's all covered up.

498
01:24:23,446 --> 01:24:27,367
You said you found her clothes
stupid and unnecessary.

499
01:24:27,659 --> 01:24:28,826
I do.

500
01:24:30,078 --> 01:24:31,871
It's just...

501
01:24:33,081 --> 01:24:37,001
I wonder what she looks like
underneath all of them.

502
01:24:37,251 --> 01:24:41,089
You mean you want to look at her...

503
01:24:41,339 --> 01:24:43,800
...because you can't see her?

504
01:24:44,634 --> 01:24:46,177
Yes.

505
01:24:46,427 --> 01:24:52,684
You remember when I wanted to go to the
north side, just because I couldn't.

506
01:24:54,852 --> 01:24:56,813
Yes, I do.

507
01:24:59,107 --> 01:25:03,027
I also remember what almost happened
to you when you did go.

508
01:25:03,319 --> 01:25:05,530
Good night, Richard.

509
01:26:08,885 --> 01:26:12,680
- What have you done to yourself?
- Don't you like it?

510
01:26:13,681 --> 01:26:17,518
No. Wash it off.

511
01:26:19,854 --> 01:26:24,067
You don't like it on me,
but you love it on Sylvia.

512
01:26:24,317 --> 01:26:29,030
Please, Lilli, let's not fight.
We promised we'd never fight.

513
01:26:31,658 --> 01:26:35,161
You never eat breakfast anymore.
Are you sick?

514
01:26:36,371 --> 01:26:39,290
Richard, I'm ready for my lesson now!

515
01:26:40,041 --> 01:26:43,127
I promised to teach her how to fish.

516
01:27:28,464 --> 01:27:30,425
Here we are together.

517
01:27:30,675 --> 01:27:34,095
Out in the middle of
a beautiful fishpond.

518
01:27:34,595 --> 01:27:37,015
In plain view of everyone.

519
01:27:37,307 --> 01:27:39,267
So respectable.

520
01:27:39,684 --> 01:27:42,854
But look at this, kind sir.

521
01:27:43,980 --> 01:27:47,692
All we have to do
is lower our heads...

522
01:27:50,194 --> 01:27:53,698
...and we're completely hidden
from prying eyes.

523
01:28:09,047 --> 01:28:11,799
So we can do whatever we want.

524
01:28:48,878 --> 01:28:51,422
- Lovely.
- Get out of here!

525
01:28:53,800 --> 01:28:56,010
Come on, don't be like that.

526
01:28:56,260 --> 01:28:59,514
- Richard?
- Richard!

527
01:28:59,722 --> 01:29:01,182
He'll never hear you.

528
01:29:01,474 --> 01:29:05,186
He'll be out playing games
with Miss Sylvia for hours.

529
01:29:15,655 --> 01:29:19,701
- You're missing something. The pearl.
- What do you mean?

530
01:29:20,118 --> 01:29:23,871
- The little bead in your hair.
- It's at the house.

531
01:29:26,457 --> 01:29:28,418
Lilli.

532
01:29:28,876 --> 01:29:32,213
It's no time to be thinking
about Lilli.

533
01:29:32,755 --> 01:29:35,508
I told her I'd never hurt her.

534
01:29:37,927 --> 01:29:41,723
Don't feel sorry for her.
She's had you all to herself.

535
01:29:42,015 --> 01:29:45,852
- You're not hers. You're not married.
- We are.

536
01:29:46,144 --> 01:29:47,145
But not really.

537
01:29:47,437 --> 01:29:50,690
Made-up words in the middle of a
jungle doesn't count.

538
01:29:50,982 --> 01:29:53,026
It does to me.

539
01:29:57,905 --> 01:30:01,951
Why don't you just follow your heart?

540
01:30:02,702 --> 01:30:06,456
She is my heart.

541
01:30:12,712 --> 01:30:13,713
Where is it?

542
01:30:14,631 --> 01:30:17,091
You can't just leave me here!

543
01:30:17,467 --> 01:30:22,639
Very rude behaviour!
You'll never fit in civilized society!

544
01:30:23,348 --> 01:30:24,891
Richard?

545
01:30:45,119 --> 01:30:46,913
Get away from her!

546
01:31:06,599 --> 01:31:10,103
- Came from the house.
- Get the other rifle.

547
01:31:33,418 --> 01:31:34,961
No!

548
01:31:38,298 --> 01:31:39,757
Get him!

549
01:31:46,014 --> 01:31:47,390
Look out!

550
01:31:49,309 --> 01:31:50,518
No!

551
01:32:04,574 --> 01:32:05,616
Help us!

552
01:32:05,908 --> 01:32:10,121
- Quinlan, hold off! You'll kill him!
- All right, that's enough.

553
01:32:10,413 --> 01:32:12,707
You heard me. I said, enough.

554
01:32:13,291 --> 01:32:14,667
Break it up.

555
01:32:14,917 --> 01:32:16,085
Quinlan!

556
01:32:16,669 --> 01:32:19,922
- Get off him.
- I'll take his bloody head off!

557
01:32:20,173 --> 01:32:22,300
- Get off him!
- Put that down.

558
01:32:23,718 --> 01:32:27,305
- Bugger off!
- Drop it, or you'll answer to mutiny!

559
01:32:33,895 --> 01:32:37,065
- I said, put it down.
- No, Richard!

560
01:32:37,315 --> 01:32:39,734
- Quinlan!
- Run!

561
01:32:41,736 --> 01:32:44,155
Richard!

562
01:34:51,115 --> 01:34:52,992
Are you all right?

563
01:34:53,826 --> 01:34:55,620
I'm fine.

564
01:34:57,288 --> 01:35:00,375
I always weather a storm well.

565
01:35:01,417 --> 01:35:03,211
I get that from Mother.

566
01:35:03,419 --> 01:35:06,005
Yes, you do.

567
01:35:08,841 --> 01:35:12,095
Captain Hilliard wants
to set sail at dawn.

568
01:35:13,721 --> 01:35:17,934
I guess that means his daughter
wants to set sail at dawn.

569
01:35:18,184 --> 01:35:23,231
I don't care what she wants.
I don't care about her at all.

570
01:35:23,856 --> 01:35:27,026
You're the most important thing
in the world.

571
01:35:29,362 --> 01:35:32,448
Well, you can set sail at dawn...

572
01:35:34,492 --> 01:35:36,536
...but we're not going.

573
01:35:37,412 --> 01:35:39,205
You're not making sense.

574
01:35:41,374 --> 01:35:43,418
Do you remember...

575
01:35:44,168 --> 01:35:47,505
...that lullaby she used to sing to us?

576
01:35:57,223 --> 01:35:58,683
Yes.

577
01:36:00,977 --> 01:36:03,980
Will you teach me to play it on this?

578
01:36:08,985 --> 01:36:10,361
Why?

579
01:36:11,279 --> 01:36:14,449
I'm going to have use for it.

580
01:36:16,451 --> 01:36:20,038
There's a baby growing inside of me.

581
01:36:21,456 --> 01:36:23,249
How do you know?

582
01:36:24,709 --> 01:36:29,005
A woman knows these
kind of things, that's how.

583
01:36:29,255 --> 01:36:30,715
Lilli!

584
01:36:34,927 --> 01:36:38,973
But I won't let it
be born in civilization.

585
01:36:39,140 --> 01:36:41,434
I want it to be born right here.

586
01:36:41,643 --> 01:36:46,356
Where there's no evil,
and no lies, and no guns.

587
01:36:48,900 --> 01:36:50,526
You're right.

588
01:36:53,237 --> 01:36:55,114
We'll stay here.

589
01:36:55,782 --> 01:36:58,076
Just the three of us.

590
01:36:58,951 --> 01:37:00,995
I love you, Lilli.

591
01:41:50,076 --> 01:41:51,077
