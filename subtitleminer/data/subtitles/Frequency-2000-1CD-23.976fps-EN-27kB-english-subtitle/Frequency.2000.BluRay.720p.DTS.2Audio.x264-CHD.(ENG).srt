Crimson and clover

2
00:00:31,149 --> 00:00:33,526
Over and over

3
00:00:34,027 --> 00:00:36,821
Crimson and clover

4
00:00:38,281 --> 00:00:39,157
...believe your eyes...

5
00:00:39,658 --> 00:00:42,702
those are the northern lights
on view above the city...

6
00:00:43,203 --> 00:00:45,914
forthefirsttime
in nearly eighty years.

7
00:00:46,414 --> 00:00:49,626
Oh, Susie Q, baby, l love you

8
00:00:51,127 --> 00:00:52,337
lt's 5.00 a.m.
Hello, New York.

9
00:00:52,837 --> 00:00:55,215
The big story this morning
is the Amazings...

10
00:00:55,715 --> 00:00:57,258
taking thefield today
in Baltimore...

11
00:00:57,759 --> 00:00:59,427
fortheirfinal practise
before tomorrow's opener...

12
00:00:59,928 --> 00:01:02,013
of the 1969 World...

13
00:01:02,514 --> 00:01:03,765
Early this morning,
sanitation workers...

14
00:01:04,265 --> 00:01:05,684
discovered the dead body
of another nurse...

15
00:01:06,184 --> 00:01:07,352
in a Dumpster in Queens.

16
00:01:07,852 --> 00:01:09,813
This is the third nurse killed
in what New York papers...

17
00:01:10,313 --> 00:01:13,733
are now calling
the Nightingale murders.

18
00:01:19,614 --> 00:01:21,282
All three victims
have been nurses...

19
00:01:21,783 --> 00:01:22,867
each of themfound strangled...

20
00:01:23,368 --> 00:01:25,245
with their hands gruesomely
bound behind their backs...

21
00:01:25,745 --> 00:01:27,580
with glass tape.

22
00:01:28,081 --> 00:01:30,208
The lights, also known
as the aurora borealis...

23
00:01:30,709 --> 00:01:32,377
Look out!

24
00:01:46,016 --> 00:01:47,684
Manhattan calling
Eye of the Storm.

25
00:01:48,184 --> 00:01:50,603
Engine company one-two,
ladder company nine-three...

26
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:52,147
respond to Manhattan box...

27
00:01:52,647 --> 00:01:56,109
one-three-two off-ramp
on George Washington Bridge.

28
00:01:56,609 --> 00:01:58,361
On ourway.

29
00:02:02,657 --> 00:02:05,368
Frank,we're the second in.
We gotthe rescue.

30
00:02:05,869 --> 00:02:07,329
Great.

31
00:02:36,024 --> 00:02:37,275
Commander,
what do you need done?

32
00:02:37,776 --> 00:02:38,985
That dike's aboutto go.

33
00:02:39,486 --> 00:02:40,612
We're one spark away
from losing the block.

34
00:02:41,112 --> 00:02:41,863
ls there anotherway in?

35
00:02:42,364 --> 00:02:44,199
Only that manhole
leads to the vault.

36
00:02:44,699 --> 00:02:45,784
Forget it, Sullivan.

37
00:02:46,284 --> 00:02:49,663
Vault door's rusted shut,
and they can't kill the juice.

38
00:02:50,163 --> 00:02:52,582
Frank,you're not gonna make it.
There's not enough time.

39
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:54,417
What, miss the World Series?

40
00:02:54,918 --> 00:02:57,253
Not a chance.
Give me my tools.

41
00:03:01,424 --> 00:03:03,969
Sullivan,
this is Commander O'Connell.

42
00:03:04,469 --> 00:03:05,261
Can you hear me?

43
00:03:05,762 --> 00:03:06,596
l hearyou, Commander.

44
00:03:07,097 --> 00:03:08,640
The gasoline
is rising in the vault.

45
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:12,560
Those downed cables
hitthat gas, it's gonna blow.

46
00:03:13,061 --> 00:03:13,770
Way to go, Gib.

47
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:16,731
l should have been
a goddamn mailman.

48
00:03:20,026 --> 00:03:22,362
Clearthis channel.
Explosion's imminent.

49
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:29,786

50
00:03:30,287 --> 00:03:32,038

52
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:41,548
Frank, it's gonnaflash.
Get outta there.

53
00:03:42,048 --> 00:03:44,092
The dike isn't holding.

54
00:03:44,592 --> 00:03:45,343
Get us out!

55
00:03:45,844 --> 00:03:47,053

Gimme a whack. No sparks.
Again.

59
00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:00,191
One more.
OK, stand back.

60
00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:11,494
Thank God!

61
00:04:11,995 --> 00:04:14,539
My leg's all busted up.

62
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,250
Please hurry.

63
00:04:17,751 --> 00:04:19,377

00:07:30,652 --> 00:07:33,530
Yeah,why not a little
of the King?

97
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:34,739
Damn!

Yeah. L think l ruined

100
00:07:41,121 --> 00:07:42,038
What's the matter, bud?

101
00:07:42,539 --> 00:07:44,833
Trouble working an 8-hour shift
atthe hospital...

102
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:47,544
watchin' the kid,

103
00:07:48,837 --> 00:07:49,963
You didn't marry Donna Reed.

113
00:08:19,409 --> 00:08:21,911
Butch, he's getting
a little tight in his old age.

114
00:08:22,412 --> 00:08:24,914
Nothing wrong with old age,
as long as you getthere.

115
00:09:04,955 --> 00:09:05,914
All right, Chief.

116

You all right?

124
00:09:31,147 --> 00:09:32,691

Come on, Chief.
Don't quit on me now.

128
00:09:42,534 --> 00:09:45,245
Don't be so tough on him.
He's just a kid.

129
00:09:47,289 --> 00:09:50,083
He just needs to know
you're behind him.

130
00:09:52,252 --> 00:09:56,214
OK. You're right. All right.

131
00:10:39,132 --> 00:10:42,218
CQ-22,this is W2QYV,

132
00:10:42,719 --> 00:10:43,970
...because of
the solar activity.

133
00:10:44,471 --> 00:10:45,180
lt's beautiful.

134
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,349
We gotthe sky
lit up like a bonfire.

135
00:10:47,849 --> 00:10:49,643
Word is the sunspots

136
00:10:50,143 --> 00:10:52,395
that stretch out
half a million kilometres.

137
00:10:52,896 --> 00:10:53,855
Tell me about it.

138
00:10:54,356 --> 00:10:56,608
l'm picking up signals
l could never reach before.

139
00:10:57,108 --> 00:10:59,277
Francis, is thatyou?
How are you doing, myfriend?

Fantastic.

142
00:11:02,697 --> 00:11:05,617
My wife, Sophia,
she's giving me another baby.

143
00:11:40,443 --> 00:11:42,529
So,that's it, Samantha?
You're justwalking out?

144
00:11:43,029 --> 00:11:44,614
l've been walking out
for six months,John.

145
00:11:45,115 --> 00:11:47,325
You just didn't notice or care.

146
00:11:52,872 --> 00:11:56,293
You're right.
We shoulda quit a long time ago.

147
00:12:00,755 --> 00:12:03,591
l'm sorry.

148
00:12:04,092 --> 00:12:07,429

l wish l could, but l can't.

149
00:12:07,929 --> 00:12:11,433
No,John,
it's thatyou won't change.

150
00:12:13,643 --> 00:12:15,645
And that's what hurts so much.

151
00:12:18,064 --> 00:12:19,441
Goodbye, Chief.

152
00:13:16,414 --> 00:13:19,709
Next up,Johnny Sullivan.

153
00:13:24,464 --> 00:13:26,383

Lined hard to right.

158

Hey,you want a brewski?

164
00:14:09,384 --> 00:14:12,470
Do you believe Linda still
won't let me cook in the house?

165
00:14:12,971 --> 00:14:14,973
l melt one lousyfrying pan,
you know?

166
00:14:15,473 --> 00:14:17,225
John, guess what?
Dad's taking mefishing.

167
00:14:17,726 --> 00:14:20,103
- Wanna come?
- l wish l could, Gordy.

168
00:14:20,603 --> 00:14:22,814
Butyou bring me back
a big one, OK?

169
00:14:23,315 --> 00:14:25,108
ls it OK if Gordy
uses your old gear?

170
00:14:25,608 --> 00:14:27,235
l think it's somewhere
in the hall closet...

171
00:14:27,736 --> 00:14:28,570
if you canfind it.

172
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:30,322
Gordy, have a look.

173
00:14:32,198 --> 00:14:34,618
Yahoo went up
anotherfive points today.

174
00:14:35,118 --> 00:14:37,037
Did l miss the boat on that one.

175
00:14:37,537 --> 00:14:39,706
Shoulda,woulda, coulda, pal.

176
00:14:40,206 --> 00:14:42,667
So Sam called Linda.

177
00:14:43,168 --> 00:14:45,462
Dad,John, come here!

178
00:14:45,962 --> 00:14:48,089
Gordy,what are you
doing backthere?

179
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:50,216
Dad, check it out.

180
00:14:51,051 --> 00:14:53,887
Fire department.
Can l open it up?

181
00:14:54,387 --> 00:14:56,014
Sure.

182
00:15:04,522 --> 00:15:06,775
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Gimme that gun.

183
00:15:07,275 --> 00:15:09,194
All right?

184
00:15:09,694 --> 00:15:11,613
What's this, Dad?

185
00:15:12,113 --> 00:15:13,615
Oh, my God.

186
00:15:14,115 --> 00:15:17,118
John,
it's your dad's old ham radio.

187
00:15:17,619 --> 00:15:21,581
Remember how we used to beg him
to let us talk on this thing?

188
00:15:22,082 --> 00:15:24,250
- This...is not a toy.
- ls not a toy.

189
00:15:24,751 --> 00:15:26,002
Can we try it, Dad?

190
00:15:26,503 --> 00:15:27,253
Ask Uncle John.

191
00:15:27,754 --> 00:15:29,005
Can we try it?

192
00:15:29,506 --> 00:15:30,340
Whatthe hell.

193
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:33,677
All right. Here.
Let's grabthis baby out.

194
00:15:34,177 --> 00:15:37,806
This is whatwe used
when l was your age.

195
00:15:38,306 --> 00:15:41,768
Let's go overto the den.
Plug it in, like the old times.

196
00:15:42,268 --> 00:15:43,937
We want CW or LSB.

197
00:15:44,437 --> 00:15:47,816
Standbyfunction.
Operator. Come on.

198
00:15:48,316 --> 00:15:49,526
l don't know what's going on.

199
00:15:50,026 --> 00:15:52,612
Let's take a look
underthe hood.

200
00:15:53,113 --> 00:15:54,781
See whatwe got here.

201
00:15:56,408 --> 00:15:57,951
Checkthis baby out.

202
00:15:58,451 --> 00:15:59,744
There she is.

203
00:16:00,245 --> 00:16:02,163
This is what people used
before the Net?

204
00:16:02,664 --> 00:16:03,373
Not exactly.

205
00:16:03,873 --> 00:16:06,126
l'll tell you.
Hams were...Ah, bingo!

206
00:16:06,626 --> 00:16:08,003
These babies were different.

207
00:16:08,503 --> 00:16:09,546
Not everybody
had one of these...

208
00:16:10,046 --> 00:16:13,717
and you needed a special licence
justto be able to talk on them.

209
00:16:14,217 --> 00:16:15,385
Damn. L just...

210
00:16:15,885 --> 00:16:17,304
l don'tthink it's gonna work.

211
00:16:17,804 --> 00:16:18,513
lt's junk, kid.

212
00:16:19,014 --> 00:16:21,016
Nobody
uses those things anymore.

213
00:16:21,516 --> 00:16:23,893
Gordo,
do you know whattime it is?

214
00:16:24,394 --> 00:16:25,312
- Hey,John.
- Hi, Linda.

215
00:16:25,812 --> 00:16:27,647
Come on, Gordy. Let's go.

216
00:16:28,898 --> 00:16:31,359
l'll catch you later,
if l'm lucky.

217
00:16:45,206 --> 00:16:46,833
Hi. This is Julia Sullivan.

218
00:16:47,334 --> 00:16:50,045
Please leave a message
afterthe tone.

219
00:16:50,545 --> 00:16:52,172
Hey, Ma. Lt's me.

220
00:16:52,672 --> 00:16:54,466
Just checking in.

221
00:16:54,966 --> 00:16:56,676
You're probably atwork.

222
00:16:57,177 --> 00:17:01,848
Anyways,
l'll see you tomorrow night.

223
00:17:02,974 --> 00:17:04,225
Love you.

224
00:17:17,572 --> 00:17:20,450
The aurora borealis,
to anyone who's seen it...

225
00:17:20,951 --> 00:17:24,079
is one of the stunning events
of your lifetime.

226
00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:27,165
They're brighterthese days.
ls something going on there?

227
00:17:27,666 --> 00:17:29,834
Do they tie in with yourfield?
Where do they comefrom?

228
00:17:30,335 --> 00:17:32,462
lt's truly a stunning sight.
lt's beautiful to look at.

229
00:17:32,963 --> 00:17:36,007
l don'tthinkwe've seen one
this brightforthirty years.

230
00:17:36,508 --> 00:17:39,469
From the point of view
of physics and string theory...

231
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:41,137
there's nothing really
thatwe gain...

232
00:17:41,638 --> 00:17:42,973
from studying
the aurora borealis.

233
00:17:43,473 --> 00:17:44,724
History does teach us...

234
00:17:45,225 --> 00:17:46,935
that every time we thought
we had itfigured out...

235
00:17:47,435 --> 00:17:49,729
there was some major discovery
right around the bend...

236
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:52,065
that required complete
dramatic change...

237
00:17:52,565 --> 00:17:53,858
in our understanding
of the laws of physics.

238
00:17:54,359 --> 00:17:57,320
This is a phrase people have
begun to hear, string theory.

239
00:17:57,821 --> 00:17:59,239
Yes,that's right.

240
00:17:59,739 --> 00:18:01,825
String theory dramatically
changes our understanding...

241
00:18:02,325 --> 00:18:03,535
of space and time.

242
00:18:04,035 --> 00:18:05,704
For example, itturns out
that string theory...

243
00:18:06,204 --> 00:18:09,457
requires our universe to have 10
or possibly even 11 dimensions.

244
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:10,792
The strange thing is...

245
00:18:11,293 --> 00:18:12,502
some physicists
are even pursuing the idea...

246
00:18:13,003 --> 00:18:14,754
thatthere might be more
than one time dimension.

247
00:18:15,255 --> 00:18:17,424
So in addition to time as we
know it, psychological time...

248
00:18:17,924 --> 00:18:20,760
which seems to organize events
in the universe around us...

249
00:18:21,261 --> 00:18:22,387
there may be
a second time dimension...

250
00:18:22,887 --> 00:18:25,557
where the universe evolves
in some different manner.

251
00:18:26,057 --> 00:18:27,475
Another phrase...

252
00:18:27,976 --> 00:18:30,979
CQ-15. Come in, 15.

253
00:18:35,483 --> 00:18:39,446
W2QYV here. Who have l got?

254
00:18:39,946 --> 00:18:41,990
Name's John.

255
00:18:44,326 --> 00:18:46,036
You licensed to broadcast,
buddy?

256
00:18:46,536 --> 00:18:51,374
Look. L really don't remember
how this thing works.

257
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:54,544
Listen. You can't broadcast
without a licence.

258
00:18:55,003 --> 00:18:57,881
Unless this is an emergency,
you have to get off the band.

259
00:18:58,381 --> 00:19:01,468
Hey, pal,
my whole life's an emergency.

260
00:19:01,968 --> 00:19:04,304
Where you transmittingfrom?

261
00:19:04,804 --> 00:19:06,514
Queens, New York.

262
00:19:07,015 --> 00:19:10,101
What do you know?
Bayside, born and raised.

263
00:19:10,602 --> 00:19:11,311
No kidding?

264
00:19:11,811 --> 00:19:13,980
l thoughtthese things were
fortalking around the world.

265
00:19:14,481 --> 00:19:15,982
The 15 band
closes down at night...

266
00:19:16,483 --> 00:19:17,359
but during the day...

267
00:19:17,859 --> 00:19:20,820
you can chew the band with China
if you want.

268
00:19:21,321 --> 00:19:23,448
l can't believe people
are still using these things.

269
00:19:23,949 --> 00:19:25,533
You must be a real old-timer.

270
00:19:26,034 --> 00:19:29,079
Days like this, lfeel like
l'm getting there,you know?

271
00:19:29,579 --> 00:19:32,123
So, Queens,
you psychedforthe series?

272
00:19:32,624 --> 00:19:36,461
You know, l really don't
follow baseball anymore.

273
00:19:36,962 --> 00:19:38,338
What?

274
00:19:38,838 --> 00:19:40,340
l gotfed up
with all the bullshit.

275
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,342
What are you talking about?

276
00:19:42,842 --> 00:19:44,594
Let me tell you something.
A thousand yearsfrom now...

277
00:19:45,095 --> 00:19:46,596
when school kids study
aboutAmerica...

278
00:19:47,097 --> 00:19:48,598
they're gonna learn
aboutthree things.

279
00:19:49,099 --> 00:19:53,186
The Constitution,
rock'n' roll, and baseball.

280
00:19:54,688 --> 00:19:58,149
How can you live in Queens
and not love the Amazings?

281
00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:02,821
The Amazing Mets?
What,the'69 series?

282
00:20:03,321 --> 00:20:06,449
Man, l'll love Ron Swoboda
till the day l die.

283
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:09,327
Now l'm with you.
He's gotthe heart of a lion.

284
00:20:09,828 --> 00:20:11,496
Mets can'twin game one
without him.

285
00:20:11,997 --> 00:20:13,039
Can you hear me?

286
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:15,542
Game one?
What are you talking about?

287
00:20:16,042 --> 00:20:17,085
ltwas all over after Buford...

288
00:20:17,585 --> 00:20:19,796
nailed Seaver's second pitch
out of the park.

289
00:20:21,131 --> 00:20:23,174
No way, buddy.
Ain't gonna happen.

290
00:20:23,675 --> 00:20:25,093
Hey, CQ-15.

291
00:20:25,593 --> 00:20:28,346
CQ-15, are you there?

292
00:20:31,766 --> 00:20:33,101
Who the hell was that?

293
00:20:33,601 --> 00:20:36,104
Queens, are you there, Queens?
Did l lose you?

294
00:20:36,604 --> 00:20:38,857
Hey, Frank.
Give the radio a rest.

295
00:20:39,357 --> 00:20:41,318
Your son wants
to say good night.

296
00:20:41,818 --> 00:20:43,236
All right.
l'll be rightthere.

297
00:20:43,737 --> 00:20:46,698
Would parallel universes
ever become aware of each other?

298
00:20:47,198 --> 00:20:48,908
Who knows?
lt's a strange idea...

299
00:20:49,409 --> 00:20:51,161
Elvis,you all right?
l'm sorry.

300
00:20:51,661 --> 00:20:52,829
- You OK, Frank?
- We'refine.

301
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:54,581
You all right, buddy?

302
00:20:55,081 --> 00:20:57,417
You OK, buddy?

303
00:20:59,628 --> 00:21:01,171
The sunspots are going to
have a serious impact...

304
00:21:01,671 --> 00:21:04,883
on radio communications
forthe next six or seven days.

305
00:21:05,383 --> 00:21:06,926
lnfact,
quantum theory tells us...

306
00:21:07,427 --> 00:21:09,846
thatthe rigid notions
of past, present andfuture...

307
00:21:10,347 --> 00:21:11,848
although useful
in day-to-day life...

308
00:21:12,349 --> 00:21:15,060
may dissolve and be replaced
by a complexformulation...

309
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,062
in which time
isfar morefluid...

310
00:21:17,562 --> 00:21:18,980
than anybody
would have imagined.

311
00:21:19,481 --> 00:21:23,860
Take me outto the ballgame

312
00:21:24,361 --> 00:21:28,031
Take me outwith the crowd

313
00:21:28,531 --> 00:21:34,037
Buy me some peanuts
and CrackerJacks

314
00:21:34,537 --> 00:21:39,376
l don't care if l never get back

315
00:21:39,876 --> 00:21:41,086
'Cause it's root

316
00:21:41,586 --> 00:21:45,256
Root, rootforthe home team

317
00:21:45,757 --> 00:21:48,009
lf we don'twin

318
00:21:52,555 --> 00:21:54,849
Two,three strikes you're out

319
00:21:55,350 --> 00:22:00,188
Atthe old ballgame

320
00:22:01,022 --> 00:22:02,273
That's perfect.

321
00:22:03,483 --> 00:22:04,985

00:22:24,462 --> 00:22:26,256
Proby,walk away.

Thirty-six hours,

334
00:22:48,778 --> 00:22:50,739
That's why you're the doctor,

347
00:23:21,519 --> 00:23:23,063
You're welcome.

348

350
00:23:28,026 --> 00:23:30,987
Everybody.
Everybody say, "Amazing Mets."

351
00:23:31,488 --> 00:23:33,490
Amazing Mets.

352
00:23:53,802 --> 00:23:55,595
Don't choke on your pride, Sul.

353
00:23:56,096 --> 00:23:58,431
You ain't never gonna
find another one like Sam.

354
00:23:58,932 --> 00:24:01,518
She made up her mind, Satch.
Nothin' l do is gonna change it.

355
00:24:02,018 --> 00:24:03,311
Nothing you're willing to do.

356
00:24:03,812 --> 00:24:05,730
- What's the story?
- Construction crewfound a body.

357
00:24:06,231 --> 00:24:08,441
Actually, a skeleton.

358
00:24:11,903 --> 00:24:16,283
OK. Well, be real careful
when you pull it out.

359
00:24:16,783 --> 00:24:19,869
Make sure you get
the dirt around it.

360
00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:21,246
What's this construction?

361
00:24:21,746 --> 00:24:24,457
l think l'll visit
the neighbours, Satch.

362
00:24:24,958 --> 00:24:27,168
Yeah, OK.
What did they tear down here?

363
00:24:27,669 --> 00:24:28,962

364
00:24:29,462 --> 00:24:32,465
l used to get breakfastthere
all the time.

365
00:24:32,966 --> 00:24:34,634
Them Greeks were good people.

366
00:24:35,135 --> 00:24:36,261
Careful. Lt's hot.

367
00:24:36,761 --> 00:24:37,971
Thankyou, Mrs Shepard.

368
00:24:38,471 --> 00:24:40,140
Once that McDonald's
opened up on Dyckman...

369
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,684
they lost all their business.

370
00:24:43,184 --> 00:24:45,937
- l see your son's on the job.
- Was.

371
00:24:46,438 --> 00:24:49,107
Jack died a while back.

372
00:24:49,607 --> 00:24:51,401
lt's hard. L know.

373
00:24:51,901 --> 00:24:54,195
ltjust seems like yesterday.

374
00:24:55,614 --> 00:24:57,907
My son lived and bled blue.

375
00:24:58,408 --> 00:25:00,160
- Get out of here.
- OK, Detective.

376
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:02,954
- Give my regards to Beth.
- Sure will.

377
00:25:06,875 --> 00:25:08,752
This isn't going to be anything
but a history lesson.

378
00:25:09,252 --> 00:25:11,212
Let's go backto the house.

379
00:25:25,101 --> 00:25:26,978
Hey, Barney. How you doing?

380
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:28,438
Good.

381

Here you go. Have a good night.

382
00:25:34,945 --> 00:25:36,863
l thought it'd be nicer
to eat here.

383
00:25:37,364 --> 00:25:39,407
Sounds good.

384
00:25:39,908 --> 00:25:41,993
l'm sorry Samantha
couldn't make it.

385
00:25:42,494 --> 00:25:47,582
Those grad school applications
are driving her crazy.

386
00:25:49,626 --> 00:25:50,418
How's it coming?

387
00:25:50,919 --> 00:25:53,713
l gotthe VCR hooked up.
lt's justthisfriggin' clock.

388
00:25:54,214 --> 00:25:55,799
Doesn't matter.

389
00:26:00,053 --> 00:26:01,012

392
00:26:06,935 --> 00:26:07,727
What's that?

393
00:26:08,228 --> 00:26:09,187
With Sam.

394
00:26:09,688 --> 00:26:12,691
Oh,yeah,you know,

395
00:26:13,191 --> 00:26:15,735
So how are things
atthe hospital?

396
00:26:16,236 --> 00:26:19,531
Fine.
Dr Schwartz retired last month.

397
00:26:20,031 --> 00:26:20,991
No kidding.

398
00:26:21,491 --> 00:26:24,202

407
00:26:59,529 --> 00:27:01,573
He was just a big kid.

408
00:27:02,073 --> 00:27:04,034
He wanted to
play baseballforever.

409

Let's wake upthe world, huh?

641
00:46:31,785 --> 00:46:35,664
Oh, my God.

642
00:47:27,632 --> 00:47:29,467
John Sullivan?

643
00:47:31,761 --> 00:47:33,888
lt's me.

644
00:47:43,231 --> 00:47:45,442
You're the voice of an angel.

645
00:47:45,942 --> 00:47:46,985
Reached right out of heaven...

646
00:47:47,485 --> 00:47:50,905
and you pulled my butt
out of thefire.

647
00:47:51,406 --> 00:47:52,991
Tell me l'm not dreaming here.

648
00:47:53,491 --> 00:47:55,577
Tell me it's really you.

649
00:47:56,077 --> 00:47:59,664
lt's me,John.
This ain't no dream.

650
00:48:00,165 --> 00:48:01,249
But how could it be?

651
00:48:01,750 --> 00:48:03,043
l don't know.

652
00:48:03,543 --> 00:48:06,755
Butwe gotta be talking off
the mother sunspot of all time.

653
00:48:07,255 --> 00:48:09,174
Yeah, l'd say so.

654
00:48:12,886 --> 00:48:14,095
You OK, Chief?

655
00:48:15,764 --> 00:48:17,724
Yeah, l'mfine.

656
00:48:18,224 --> 00:48:19,976
You sure?

657
00:48:20,477 --> 00:48:22,687
Yeah, it's...

658
00:48:23,188 --> 00:48:26,650
lt's tough to explain.

659
00:48:27,150 --> 00:48:29,819
l mean, l got all these
new memories, but it's...

660
00:48:30,278 --> 00:48:31,863
it's like l don't know
whatto believe.

661
00:48:32,364 --> 00:48:33,782
What do you mean?

662
00:48:34,282 --> 00:48:35,533
'Cause l still remember
what itwas like...

663
00:48:36,034 --> 00:48:37,160
when you died in thefire.

664
00:48:37,661 --> 00:48:38,578
But l'm the only one.

665
00:48:39,079 --> 00:48:42,040
l don't understand
whatyou're talking about.

666
00:48:42,540 --> 00:48:45,710
l remember both...
atthe same time.

667
00:48:46,211 --> 00:48:48,546
And...it's like
waking upfrom a dream...

668
00:48:49,047 --> 00:48:50,465
and you're not sure what's real.

669
00:48:50,966 --> 00:48:54,094
l rememberyou being here, but l
also rememberwhen you weren't.

670
00:48:54,594 --> 00:48:57,055
l'm sorry,John.

671
00:48:57,555 --> 00:48:59,307
l'm sorry.
l neverthoughtthat...

672
00:48:59,808 --> 00:49:01,351
Well,
you gotta think aboutthat...

673
00:49:01,851 --> 00:49:05,230
and you gotta be more careful,
'cause l can't lose you again.

674
00:49:05,730 --> 00:49:07,440
Not like that.

675
00:49:10,026 --> 00:49:11,945
You won't,John.
You won't.

676
00:49:12,445 --> 00:49:14,864
l swearto God,
no matterwhat, not like that.

677
00:49:15,365 --> 00:49:16,825
You got it? You hear me?

678
00:49:17,325 --> 00:49:18,952
You hear me, Chief?

679
00:49:19,452 --> 00:49:21,413
l hearyou.

680
00:49:26,209 --> 00:49:28,753
So how old are you?

681
00:49:30,380 --> 00:49:32,549
l'm thirty-six.

682
00:49:33,049 --> 00:49:34,426
Thirty-six.

683
00:49:34,926 --> 00:49:36,344
You're all grown up.

684
00:49:36,845 --> 00:49:39,848
You gotta be married
and everything.

685
00:49:40,348 --> 00:49:42,767
No, l'm not married.

686
00:49:43,268 --> 00:49:45,353
What,you're too busy
playing ball?

687
00:49:45,854 --> 00:49:48,898
No, it didn'twork out.

688
00:49:49,399 --> 00:49:50,900
l gave it up.

689
00:49:51,401 --> 00:49:52,235
What happened?

690
00:49:52,736 --> 00:49:56,615
l just...blew my arm out
my senioryear.

691
00:49:57,115 --> 00:49:58,366
Didn't have a shot.

692
00:49:58,867 --> 00:50:00,702
Oh, l'm sorry.
l'm sorry,Johnny.

693
00:50:01,202 --> 00:50:02,829
l know that had to hurt.

694
00:50:03,330 --> 00:50:05,874
Yeah. Thanks.

695
00:50:06,374 --> 00:50:08,335
So,what'd you wind up doing?

696
00:50:08,835 --> 00:50:09,753
You join the department?

697
00:50:10,253 --> 00:50:13,923
Actually, l wentthe otherway.

698
00:50:14,424 --> 00:50:15,717
l'm a cop.

699
00:50:18,094 --> 00:50:19,554
You're third-generation
fire-fighter.

700
00:50:20,055 --> 00:50:22,098
l thoughtyou were gonna
grow out of that cop phase.

701
00:50:22,599 --> 00:50:24,643
You got Satch to thank
forthat one.

702
00:50:25,143 --> 00:50:26,645
You gotta be kidding me.

703
00:50:27,145 --> 00:50:27,896
Satch.

704
00:50:28,396 --> 00:50:32,484
He always crazy aboutyou
ever since you were born.

705
00:50:35,695 --> 00:50:38,365
You're still my Little Chief.

706
00:50:38,823 --> 00:50:40,575
Right?

707
00:50:42,994 --> 00:50:46,623
Yeah, l'm trying to be.

708
00:50:47,123 --> 00:50:49,125
l'm trying.

709
00:50:52,379 --> 00:50:54,047
Well,tell me aboutyourself.

710
00:50:54,547 --> 00:50:56,883
Tell me aboutyour life.

711
00:50:57,384 --> 00:51:01,721
l mean,
where do l start,you know?

712
00:51:02,222 --> 00:51:04,182
Mustang? L don't own a Mustang.

713
00:51:04,683 --> 00:51:07,894
Well,you will,
and you loved it.

714
00:51:08,395 --> 00:51:10,272
Fire-engine red.
Four on thefloor.

715
00:51:10,772 --> 00:51:11,523
Seventy home runs?

716
00:51:12,023 --> 00:51:13,149
That's a record
thatwill never be broken.

717
00:51:13,650 --> 00:51:16,569
l wouldn't be too sure.
The other guy hit sixty-six.

718
00:51:17,070 --> 00:51:18,822
Really? You mean like
those bigfield radios...

719
00:51:19,322 --> 00:51:20,240
they use in the army?

720
00:51:20,740 --> 00:51:21,449
No, much smaller.

721
00:51:21,950 --> 00:51:23,285
Works off a satellite
or something.

722
00:51:23,785 --> 00:51:25,328
You carry it around
in your pocket.

723
00:51:25,829 --> 00:51:28,623
What about "Apollo"?
How did it all work out?

724
00:51:29,124 --> 00:51:30,959
ltwas a great series, Pop.
Amazing.

725
00:51:31,459 --> 00:51:32,168
We win, right?

726
00:51:32,669 --> 00:51:34,212
Hold your horses.
l'm getting there.

727
00:51:34,713 --> 00:51:36,006
Game three,
Agee came through...

728
00:51:36,506 --> 00:51:37,632
homered off Palmer
in the second.

729
00:51:38,133 --> 00:51:40,135
l knew Agee was going to have
a great series.

730
00:51:40,635 --> 00:51:41,553
Forget aboutAgee.

731
00:51:42,053 --> 00:51:43,763
Wait until you hear
what happened to Cleon Jones.

732
00:51:44,264 --> 00:51:46,766
- Now you sound like your mother.
- No, l'm serious.

733
00:51:47,267 --> 00:51:48,351
Come on. Your grandfather...

734
00:51:48,852 --> 00:51:50,812
he smoked two packs a day,
and he's still kicking.

735
00:51:51,313 --> 00:51:55,567
Notyou. Lt's gonna get
the better of you.

736
00:52:00,864 --> 00:52:04,909
Well, l just knew.
She melted my heart.

737
00:52:05,410 --> 00:52:07,746
Thatwas it.

738
00:52:08,246 --> 00:52:09,998
You got anybody?

739
00:52:10,498 --> 00:52:13,752
Yeah. Kinda.

740
00:52:14,961 --> 00:52:18,715
Something l gotta work out,
but...

741
00:52:19,215 --> 00:52:21,384
she's worth it.

742
00:52:23,970 --> 00:52:27,140
No,you...go ahead.

743
00:52:27,641 --> 00:52:28,808
You get some rest.

744
00:52:29,309 --> 00:52:32,145
l'm tired,too.

745
00:52:32,646 --> 00:52:36,107
l almost don'twanna
click off here, like...

746
00:52:36,608 --> 00:52:38,735
maybe we won't getthis back.

747
00:52:39,235 --> 00:52:41,237
We will.

748
00:52:44,282 --> 00:52:46,534
l'll be here tomorrow.

749
00:52:48,244 --> 00:52:50,455

750
00:53:01,841 --> 00:53:04,135

753
00:53:13,979 --> 00:53:15,981
And...

755
00:53:38,503 --> 00:53:40,046

765
00:54:43,193 --> 00:54:43,902
Where's Johnny?

766
00:54:44,402 --> 00:54:46,821
He's at Gordo's.
l tucked him in.

767
00:54:47,322 --> 00:54:48,615
You give him his drops?

768
00:54:49,115 --> 00:54:50,617
One in each ear.

769
00:54:51,117 --> 00:54:52,577
Whatwould you do without me?

770
00:54:53,078 --> 00:54:54,704
Probably marry some rich doctor.

771
00:54:55,205 --> 00:54:56,998
Never have to work.

772
00:54:57,499 --> 00:54:58,625
Oh, my God.
What is he doing?

773
00:54:59,125 --> 00:54:59,918

l gave this patient
fifty mils of Benadryl.

776
00:55:05,090 --> 00:55:05,966
Mix them and he's dead.

777
00:55:06,466 --> 00:55:08,343
- Why wasn't l informed?
- lt's in his chart.

778

Disrespectyourself
all you wantto...

804
00:59:29,354 --> 00:59:30,730
but not me
or anybody else here.

805
00:59:31,231 --> 00:59:32,941
You gotthat?

806
00:59:41,074 --> 00:59:43,743
We gotthe preliminaryforensics
back on the skeleton.

807
00:59:44,202 --> 00:59:46,913
You wantto take a look atthis.

808
00:59:55,255 --> 00:59:57,257
Bad memories.

809
00:59:57,757 --> 01:00:01,136
You imagine the odds of us
digging up a Nightingale murder?

810
01:00:02,804 --> 01:00:03,680
She makes ten.

811
01:00:04,180 --> 01:00:05,557
Ten?

812
01:00:06,057 --> 01:00:07,684
No, l rememberthis case.

813
01:00:08,184 --> 01:00:10,061
ltwas three.
He killed three women.

814
01:00:10,562 --> 01:00:12,397
What are you talkin'?

815
01:00:12,897 --> 01:00:14,899
You know betterthan anybody,
John.

816
01:00:19,070 --> 01:00:21,990
You looked atthesefiles
a thousand times.

817
01:01:00,236 --> 01:01:02,238
Dad? You there?

818
01:01:03,740 --> 01:01:05,158
Can you hear me?

819
01:01:05,659 --> 01:01:07,619
Dad, l need you to be there.

820
01:01:08,119 --> 01:01:11,122
Yeah! Yeah, Chief.
l'm comin', l'm comin'.

821
01:01:11,623 --> 01:01:14,334
Listen.
There's something l need to t...

822
01:01:16,795 --> 01:01:17,921
Right here, Chief.

823
01:01:22,217 --> 01:01:24,260
Something happened.
Something pretty bad.

824
01:01:24,761 --> 01:01:26,429
What's the matter,Johnny?
What is it?

825
01:01:26,930 --> 01:01:29,015
Mom. Something happened to her.

826
01:01:29,516 --> 01:01:30,767
Your mom? What?

827
01:01:31,268 --> 01:01:32,769
She's not here.

828
01:01:33,270 --> 01:01:36,189
What do you mean,
she's notthere?

829
01:01:38,650 --> 01:01:42,779
She died. But it's like
itjust...happened,though.

830
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:44,864
She died?
Your mom just died?

831
01:01:45,365 --> 01:01:48,285
No. Dad, it happened
a long time ago.

832
01:01:48,785 --> 01:01:50,370
A long time agofor me.

833
01:01:50,870 --> 01:01:52,747
When?

834
01:01:53,248 --> 01:01:57,335
October 22, 1969.

835
01:01:58,753 --> 01:02:01,172
That's now,Johnny.
That's nextweek.

836
01:02:01,673 --> 01:02:05,302
You gotto tell me how.

837
01:02:05,802 --> 01:02:06,595
She was murdered.

838
01:02:07,095 --> 01:02:08,346
Murdered?
What are you talking about?

839
01:02:08,847 --> 01:02:10,640
There was this case, a serial.

840
01:02:11,141 --> 01:02:13,351
They never caught him,
but he murdered three women...

841
01:02:13,852 --> 01:02:16,313
all nurses,
between 68th and 69th.

842
01:02:16,813 --> 01:02:17,689
They call him the Nightingale.

843
01:02:18,189 --> 01:02:18,898
The Nightingale?

844
01:02:19,399 --> 01:02:21,276
We've been watching that
on the news. L was worried...

845
01:02:21,776 --> 01:02:23,570
Dad,we did something.

846
01:02:24,070 --> 01:02:25,363
Something to make itworse.

847
01:02:25,864 --> 01:02:27,157
l don't understand.

848
01:02:27,657 --> 01:02:30,952
He didn'tjust kill three women
anymore. He's killed ten.

849
01:02:31,453 --> 01:02:33,121
Something we did
changed the past.

850
01:02:33,622 --> 01:02:34,831
But how come your mother...

851
01:02:35,332 --> 01:02:37,417
Everything you did is different
than whatwould have happened...

852
01:02:37,917 --> 01:02:39,461
if you would have never
gotten out of thatwarehouse.

853
01:02:39,961 --> 01:02:41,755
Now what'd you do last night,
Dad?

854
01:02:42,255 --> 01:02:44,049
l talked to you.

855
01:02:44,549 --> 01:02:46,885
l putyou on the bike.

856
01:02:47,385 --> 01:02:48,511
l tucked you in
over at Gordo's...

857
01:02:49,012 --> 01:02:51,348
and l wentto see your mother
over atthe hospital.

858
01:02:51,848 --> 01:02:53,391
Oh, shit. That's it.

859
01:02:53,892 --> 01:02:56,144
She wasn't supposed to be there.
Butch went and got her.

860
01:02:56,645 --> 01:02:58,188
Thatwas the night of thefire
when he brought her home.

861
01:02:58,688 --> 01:02:59,773
You're saying something happened
atthat hospital?

862
01:03:00,273 --> 01:03:01,024
That's justthe beginning.

863
01:03:01,524 --> 01:03:03,360
lt could have been
anywhere, place,time...

864
01:03:03,860 --> 01:03:04,986
that she wouldn't have been
if you woulda died.

865
01:03:05,487 --> 01:03:06,613
l'll take her awayfrom here,
Johnny.

866
01:03:07,113 --> 01:03:08,031
l have to take her away.

867
01:03:08,531 --> 01:03:09,950
He cannot hurt her
if l take her away.

868
01:03:10,450 --> 01:03:13,328
What aboutthe others, Dad?

869
01:03:13,828 --> 01:03:14,829
l'll warn them.

870
01:03:15,330 --> 01:03:16,915
That'll neverwork.
They'll justthinkyou're crazy.

871
01:03:17,415 --> 01:03:19,000
But l gotta do something.
l...

872
01:03:19,501 --> 01:03:22,170
You don't even know
whatthis guy looks like.

873
01:03:22,629 --> 01:03:25,465
Nobody got any...
Hold on. Wait a minute.

874
01:03:27,968 --> 01:03:29,970
Dad, l may not know
who he is...

875
01:03:30,470 --> 01:03:31,513
but l know
where he's gonna be...

876
01:03:32,013 --> 01:03:33,223
and what he's gonna do
before he gets there.

877
01:03:33,723 --> 01:03:35,725
What do l do?
Do l call the police?

878
01:03:36,226 --> 01:03:36,977
They're not gonna believe me.

879
01:03:37,477 --> 01:03:38,937
They will if they catch him
in the act.

880
01:03:39,437 --> 01:03:40,438
You can make that happen, Dad.

881
01:03:40,939 --> 01:03:42,524
No,Johnny. L don't know.

882
01:03:43,024 --> 01:03:44,025
l'm afire-fighter.

883
01:03:44,526 --> 01:03:45,860
l'm a cop!
This is what l do.

884
01:03:46,361 --> 01:03:47,654
This is something we have to do!

885
01:03:48,154 --> 01:03:50,699
What if the ham stops working?
What if l can't reach you?

886
01:03:51,199 --> 01:03:52,242
Then you get Mom the hell out.

887
01:03:52,742 --> 01:03:56,079
But, Dad,those otherwomen
were not supposed to die.

888
01:03:56,579 --> 01:03:58,123
lf we don't do something
and try to stopthis guy...

889
01:03:58,623 --> 01:04:01,543
we'll have to live with that
forthe rest of our lives.

890
01:04:03,295 --> 01:04:05,880
OK,tell me whatto do.

891
01:04:06,381 --> 01:04:07,090
All right.

892
01:04:07,590 --> 01:04:09,718
The nextvictim
is Carrie Reynolds.

893
01:04:10,218 --> 01:04:11,303
lt happens tomorrow.

894
01:04:11,803 --> 01:04:13,972
Casefile said she left
the Roosevelt Hospital at 6.00.

895
01:04:14,472 --> 01:04:16,224
Showed up at Cozy's Bar
around 6.30.

896
01:04:16,725 --> 01:04:19,227
She walked out of that bar
around 7.30...

897
01:04:19,728 --> 01:04:22,939
and theyfound her dead in
an alley behind the bar at8.00.

898
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:24,691
l wantyou tofollow her...

899
01:04:25,191 --> 01:04:27,193
see if anybody's watching her
or hitting on her.

900
01:04:27,694 --> 01:04:29,904
'Cause l'm betting when she
walks out of that place...

901
01:04:30,405 --> 01:04:32,532
somebody's gonna come
out of there with her.

902
01:04:33,033 --> 01:04:34,492
When they do,
you call the cops.

903
01:04:34,993 --> 01:04:35,702
Hi, Carrie.

904
01:04:36,202 --> 01:04:37,454
Hiya, Glen. How you doin'?

905
01:04:37,704 --> 01:04:38,955
Real good.

906
01:05:26,795 --> 01:05:29,214
From the girls, pal.

907
01:05:37,055 --> 01:05:39,182
Thanks.

908
01:05:45,981 --> 01:05:47,023
l was...

909
01:05:47,524 --> 01:05:49,317
Sit down.

910
01:05:49,818 --> 01:05:51,528
- Fireman, huh?
- Yeah. L'm not really...

911
01:05:52,028 --> 01:05:53,738
Ah, a marriedfireman.

912
01:05:55,323 --> 01:05:57,826
Whatthe hell.
What do they call you?

913
01:06:04,749 --> 01:06:07,252
7-4 Homicide.

914
01:06:07,752 --> 01:06:09,004
Yeah, it's me.

915
01:06:09,504 --> 01:06:10,797
You're kidding.

916
01:06:13,717 --> 01:06:16,553
Hold on. Spell thatfor me.

917
01:06:17,053 --> 01:06:20,223
OK. Thanks, Mario.

918
01:06:22,559 --> 01:06:25,061
Our lucky break.
Mario lD'd the dental.

919
01:06:25,562 --> 01:06:27,105
Her name is Mary Finelli.

920
01:06:27,606 --> 01:06:29,566
Reported missing April 16, 1968.

921
01:06:30,066 --> 01:06:34,279
April 16?
That means she was thefirst.

922
01:06:34,779 --> 01:06:37,324
Which means
he probably knew her.

923
01:06:37,824 --> 01:06:39,492
This case just got hot.

924
01:06:42,037 --> 01:06:43,288
She's gone.

925
01:06:43,788 --> 01:06:45,540
Carrie Reynolds isn't in here.

926
01:06:48,043 --> 01:06:49,753
Who?

927
01:06:51,713 --> 01:06:53,632
He did it.

928
01:06:57,969 --> 01:06:59,930
Carrie Reynolds
is alive and well, Dad.

929
01:07:00,430 --> 01:07:01,514
l'll be damned.

930
01:07:02,015 --> 01:07:03,433
Did you see him?

931
01:07:03,934 --> 01:07:05,644
- Figure who he is?
- No, l messed up.

932
01:07:06,144 --> 01:07:07,479
l just kepttalking to her.

933
01:07:07,979 --> 01:07:09,189
l was afraid to let her
out of my sight.

934
01:07:09,689 --> 01:07:11,358
Whoever itwas,
he must've backed off.

935
01:07:11,858 --> 01:07:14,694
That's OK. We're gonna get him.
This is gonna work.

936
01:07:15,195 --> 01:07:18,615
l hope so.
So,what else you got?

937
01:07:19,115 --> 01:07:22,160
We caught a break.
Found hisfirstvictim.

938
01:07:22,661 --> 01:07:23,954
Her name is Mary Finelli.

939
01:07:24,454 --> 01:07:26,831
- Thanks, Mrs Sullivan.
- Hang on a sec,John.

940
01:07:27,332 --> 01:07:30,919
Hey,Jules,there's somebody
l wantyou to talkto. OK?

941
01:07:31,419 --> 01:07:33,838
Remember l told you
aboutthis guy,John?

942
01:07:34,339 --> 01:07:36,383
l wantyou to say hello to him.

943
01:07:37,968 --> 01:07:40,428
Say hello to my wife,Julia.

944
01:07:46,268 --> 01:07:47,852
Franktells me you're a cop.

945
01:07:48,353 --> 01:07:49,813
Yeah,that's right.

946
01:07:50,313 --> 01:07:54,067
My six-year-old keeps telling us
he wants to be a policeman...

947
01:07:54,567 --> 01:07:55,819
right after he retires
from the majors.

948
01:07:56,319 --> 01:07:59,572
We just bought him a badge
and a whistlefor his birthday.

949
01:08:00,073 --> 01:08:02,659
Yeah, l remember. L used to play
cops and robbers all the time...

950
01:08:03,159 --> 01:08:05,495
butyou...my mom wouldn't
let me have a toy gun.

951
01:08:05,996 --> 01:08:09,791
Sounds like your mom
and l would get along.

952
01:08:10,292 --> 01:08:13,169
Yeah, she's pretty special.
l'm real proud of her.

953
01:08:13,670 --> 01:08:16,756
l bet she's proud of you,too.
Being a cop and all.

954
01:08:17,257 --> 01:08:19,259
l hope so.

955
01:08:19,759 --> 01:08:22,804
l hope she knows
how much l love her.

956
01:08:23,305 --> 01:08:24,222
Oh, she knows.

957
01:08:24,723 --> 01:08:27,017
Moms always know how much
their kids love them.

958
01:08:27,517 --> 01:08:30,895
Even if they don'ttell them
all the time, like they should.

959
01:08:32,897 --> 01:08:34,149
Well, l gotto go.

960
01:08:34,649 --> 01:08:36,526
ltwas good talking to you,
John.

01:08:59,674 --> 01:09:00,467
Sit rightthere.

972
01:09:00,967 --> 01:09:02,135
Just one more cookie, Mom.

973
01:09:02,636 --> 01:09:04,220
- No more cookies.
- Just one more.

974
01:09:04,721 --> 01:09:05,847
This is the space cowboy.

975
01:09:06,348 --> 01:09:07,807
l'm an intergalactic
traveller...

976
01:09:08,308 --> 01:09:10,143
from the Federation
planet Earth.

977
01:09:12,145 --> 01:09:13,939
How do you know my name, mister?

978
01:09:17,317 --> 01:09:20,445
Listen, Gordo,
my name is Santa Claus.

979
01:09:20,946 --> 01:09:21,988
l'm going to give you...

980
01:09:22,489 --> 01:09:24,783
the biggest Christmas present
thatyou ever had.

981
01:09:25,283 --> 01:09:28,161
l better give you
my address,then.

982
01:09:28,662 --> 01:09:31,331
No, don'tworry about it, kid.
This is important.

983
01:09:31,831 --> 01:09:35,460
Something you gotto remember
for a long time: Yahoo.

984
01:09:35,961 --> 01:09:37,545
What's that?

985
01:09:38,046 --> 01:09:40,090
lt's a magic word.
lt's like...

986
01:09:40,590 --> 01:09:43,260
like abracadabra,
but even better.

987
01:09:43,760 --> 01:09:46,012
Try it out, kid. Yahoo.

988
01:09:46,513 --> 01:09:47,806
Yahoo.

989
01:09:48,306 --> 01:09:49,683
You got it, Space Cowboy.

990
01:09:50,183 --> 01:09:51,309
OK, Gordo.
Yourtwo minutes are up.

991
01:09:51,810 --> 01:09:53,645
Go upstairs and write it down.

992
01:09:54,145 --> 01:09:56,022
OK, mister. L mean, Santa.

993
01:09:56,523 --> 01:09:57,941
Come on. Let's go.

994
01:09:58,441 --> 01:10:00,110
Stay there,John.

995
01:10:00,610 --> 01:10:01,319
Come on. Upstairs.

996
01:10:01,820 --> 01:10:06,074

997
01:10:07,367 --> 01:10:08,076

You still there?

999
01:10:10,245 --> 01:10:12,122
Yeah. What do we do now?

1000
01:10:12,622 --> 01:10:13,873
Sissy Clark.

1001
01:10:14,374 --> 01:10:15,125
423 Greenwich Street...

1002
01:10:15,625 --> 01:10:17,752
Hang on. Go ahead.

1003
01:10:18,253 --> 01:10:19,045
Sissy Clark.

1004
01:10:19,546 --> 01:10:22,674
423 Greenwich Street,
Apartment 2E. Tomorrow.

1005
01:10:23,174 --> 01:10:24,092
OK. 2E.

1006
01:10:24,593 --> 01:10:27,554
Nurse. Moonlights

1007
01:10:28,054 --> 01:10:30,223
atthe Kaleidoscope
on West rd.

1008
01:10:30,724 --> 01:10:33,268
Leftwork at 2.00 a.m.

1009
01:10:33,768 --> 01:10:37,439
Was killed in her apartment
between 2.15 and 5.00.

1010
01:10:38,440 --> 01:10:39,524
OK, l got it.

1011
01:10:40,025 --> 01:10:43,111
l don't know how long this thing
is gonna keepworking.

1012
01:10:43,612 --> 01:10:45,530
Hope we'll be able
to talk again.

1013
01:10:46,031 --> 01:10:47,782
Just be careful, all right?

1014
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:25,612
l'm happy youfound her,
Detective.

1015
01:11:26,112 --> 01:11:31,159
lt makes it easier now
to knowfor sure.

1016
01:11:31,660 --> 01:11:33,870
You know.

1017
01:11:35,497 --> 01:11:39,542
Can l keepthesefor a while,
Mrs Finelli?

1018
01:11:40,043 --> 01:11:43,129
OK,just let me
walkyou through it.

1019
01:11:43,630 --> 01:11:45,048
l'm all ears.

1020
01:11:45,548 --> 01:11:48,969
Three guys show up in both
the yearbook and diary.

1021
01:11:51,596 --> 01:11:53,974
First guy passed away
ten years ago.

1022
01:11:55,350 --> 01:11:57,269
Second guy died in Vietnam.

1023
01:11:57,769 --> 01:12:01,147
And the third one's
Daryl Simpson.

1024
01:12:01,648 --> 01:12:04,818
So l ran him though B.C.l.
Got a hit.

1025
01:12:05,318 --> 01:12:06,319
Bustedfor sexual assault...

1026
01:12:06,820 --> 01:12:08,405
eight days after
the last Nightingale murder.

1027
01:12:08,905 --> 01:12:11,324
March 22, 1970.

1028
01:12:11,825 --> 01:12:14,160
You thinkthe murders stopped
because he was off the street...

1029
01:12:14,661 --> 01:12:16,204
and by the time
he got paroled...

1030
01:12:16,705 --> 01:12:18,999
he had smartened up enough
to control himself?

1031
01:12:19,499 --> 01:12:21,418
That's notthefirsttime
that's been true.

1032
01:12:21,918 --> 01:12:23,586
l got afeelin' aboutthis guy.

1033
01:12:24,087 --> 01:12:26,089
This is him, Satch.

1034
01:12:47,193 --> 01:12:48,778
Can l getyou another one?

1035
01:12:49,279 --> 01:12:50,614
No,thanks. L'm good.

1036
01:12:54,242 --> 01:12:55,493
Anything else?

1037
01:12:55,994 --> 01:12:58,955
Sexual assault, Daryl.
Five years.

1038
01:12:59,456 --> 01:13:00,957
Butyou got lucky, right?

1039
01:13:01,458 --> 01:13:02,959
You got away
with something else.

1040
01:13:03,460 --> 01:13:05,545
Something youfigured
nobody knows about.

1041
01:13:06,046 --> 01:13:07,339
What l know is what l told you.

1042
01:13:07,839 --> 01:13:08,965
Let me tell you what l know.

1043
01:13:09,466 --> 01:13:10,550
You wentto St. Ambrose
with Mary.

1044
01:13:11,051 --> 01:13:12,093
You livedfive blocks
from her...

1045
01:13:12,594 --> 01:13:14,095
and you liked her,
but she ain't interested.

1046
01:13:14,596 --> 01:13:16,890
- That must've hurt, huh?
- So what?

1047
01:13:17,390 --> 01:13:20,226
- So what'd you do about it?
- Nothing!

1048
01:13:27,525 --> 01:13:29,527
Can l have a smoke?

1049
01:13:31,613 --> 01:13:34,574
Here. L'm trying to quit.

1050
01:13:38,745 --> 01:13:41,873
Oh, my God. What is this?

1051
01:13:42,374 --> 01:13:45,502
Ah,Jesus!
Getthat awayfrom me!

1052
01:13:46,002 --> 01:13:48,254
Sandra Moore. Patti Ryan.
Mary Finelli.

1053
01:13:48,755 --> 01:13:50,507
These names mean anything
to you, pal?

1054
01:13:51,007 --> 01:13:52,717
Julia Sullivan.
Does she mean anything?

1055
01:13:53,218 --> 01:13:56,221
Well, she means something to me!

1056
01:14:07,649 --> 01:14:09,693
See you,fireman.
Don'ttalk so much nexttime.

1057
01:14:10,193 --> 01:14:12,612
Gus,will you run my tips
while l go change?

1058
01:14:13,113 --> 01:14:14,781
- Sure, Sissy.
- Thanks.

1059
01:14:32,882 --> 01:14:34,801
You know, Daryl...

1060
01:14:35,302 --> 01:14:36,553
sometimes,
despite all the training...

1061
01:14:37,053 --> 01:14:38,096
thatwe cops go through...

1062
01:14:38,597 --> 01:14:42,392
despite all thatwe are taught
about right and wrong...

1063
01:14:42,892 --> 01:14:47,272
despite all thatwe would
like to honour in ourselves...

1064
01:14:47,772 --> 01:14:49,649
we can come to a place...

1065
01:14:50,150 --> 01:14:52,861
where we don't give a damn.

1066
01:14:54,237 --> 01:14:56,448
Know what l mean?

1067
01:14:56,948 --> 01:14:59,451
You're going to tell me
everything l need to know.

1068
01:14:59,951 --> 01:15:02,829
John. You got a minute?

1069
01:15:03,330 --> 01:15:06,207
Yeah. Sure.

1070
01:15:12,631 --> 01:15:13,924
He ain'tthe guy,John.

1071
01:15:14,424 --> 01:15:16,426
Just'cause he didn'twant
to look atthe photos...

1072
01:15:16,927 --> 01:15:17,802
doesn't mean he isn'tthe one.

1073
01:15:18,303 --> 01:15:19,304
Not everyonefits the profile.

1074
01:15:19,804 --> 01:15:20,847
lf he was gonna
give up something...

1075
01:15:21,348 --> 01:15:23,433
he would've done it already.

1076
01:15:35,862 --> 01:15:39,282
Youfollowin' me?
Huh? Youfollowin' me?

1077
01:15:41,201 --> 01:15:44,537
l asked you a question, asshole.

1078
01:15:45,038 --> 01:15:46,456
Mary Finelli.

1079
01:16:16,069 --> 01:16:18,196
Dude,what happened to him?

1080
01:16:18,697 --> 01:16:20,407
ltwas a bad trip, man.

1081
01:16:20,907 --> 01:16:22,951
A little time kissing
the porcelain, he'll befine.

1082
01:16:23,451 --> 01:16:24,411
Yeah, l understand that.

1083
01:16:24,911 --> 01:16:26,579
All right. Come on, pal.

1084
01:17:17,839 --> 01:17:21,384
Open up. Miss Clark!
Open the door!

1085
01:17:21,885 --> 01:17:23,386
lt's the police!
Open the door!

1086
01:17:23,887 --> 01:17:26,681
lt's OK, ma'am. Go back inside.
lt's the police.

1087
01:17:27,182 --> 01:17:28,642
Are you in there? Open up!

1088
01:17:29,142 --> 01:17:30,810
l know you're in there!

1089
01:17:32,938 --> 01:17:36,483
Sissy Clark! Open the door!
Open the door!

1090
01:18:24,239 --> 01:18:25,824
He killed her.

1091
01:18:27,617 --> 01:18:29,035
l couldn't do a damn thing
to stop it.

1092
01:18:29,244 --> 01:18:30,704
Dad, it's notyourfault.

1093
01:18:31,204 --> 01:18:32,038
Yes, it is.

1094
01:18:32,539 --> 01:18:34,416
We changed everything,Johnny.

1095
01:18:34,916 --> 01:18:35,875
lt's like we cheated.

1096
01:18:36,376 --> 01:18:38,378
Dad? We can't go back...

1097
01:18:38,878 --> 01:18:40,422
'cause you didn't die
in thatfire.

1098
01:18:40,922 --> 01:18:42,924
No matterwhatyou do,
nothing is gonna change it.

1099
01:18:43,425 --> 01:18:46,303
All we can do is deal with this
and try to make it right.

1100
01:18:46,803 --> 01:18:48,597
l'm not a cop.
l'm notfooling anybody.

1101
01:18:49,097 --> 01:18:50,056
l know, butwe can.

1102
01:18:50,557 --> 01:18:53,518
We can do ittogether.
Remember spirit and guts?

1103
01:18:54,019 --> 01:18:57,731
John,
he's got my driver's licence.

1104
01:18:58,231 --> 01:18:59,399
What?

1105
01:18:59,899 --> 01:19:02,694
He took my driver's licence.
He knows where we live.

1106
01:19:03,194 --> 01:19:05,155
He tookyour dr...
He tookyourwallet?

1107
01:19:05,655 --> 01:19:08,241
Well, he tossed the wallet,
but he keptthe licence.

1108
01:19:08,742 --> 01:19:09,659
He touched yourwallet?
Where's yourwallet?

1109
01:19:10,160 --> 01:19:10,994
lt's in my pocket.

1110
01:19:11,494 --> 01:19:13,246
We got him, Dad. You got him.

1111
01:19:13,747 --> 01:19:15,290
His prints. You got his prints.

You gotto get me thatwallet.

1113
01:19:17,834 --> 01:19:19,753
How the hell am l supposed
to do that?

1114
01:19:20,253 --> 01:19:21,421
As carefully as possible.

1115
01:19:21,922 --> 01:19:23,548
Take yourwallet out,
butjusttouch the corners.

1116
01:19:24,049 --> 01:19:25,675
- What are you talking about?
- Just do it.

1117
01:19:26,176 --> 01:19:28,136
OK, all right.
All right.

1118
01:19:28,637 --> 01:19:30,263
- Right.
- OK. All right. L got it.

1119
01:19:30,764 --> 01:19:32,182
All right. Now. Listen.

1120
01:19:32,682 --> 01:19:34,309
l wantyou to wrap it up.

1121
01:19:34,809 --> 01:19:36,561
Put it in one of them
plastic bags...

1122
01:19:37,062 --> 01:19:38,229
you keep extra transistors in.

1123
01:19:38,730 --> 01:19:40,106
Yeah. L see where you're going.

1124
01:19:40,607 --> 01:19:43,109
Beautiful. OK.
Now hide it somewhere.

1125
01:19:43,610 --> 01:19:47,906
Somewhere where nobody's gonna
find itforthe next30 years.

1126
01:19:48,406 --> 01:19:49,616
- l think maybe...
- Where?

1127
01:19:50,116 --> 01:19:52,118
The window seat
in the dining room.

1128
01:19:52,619 --> 01:19:55,205
There's a loose board
on the left, on the bottom.

1129
01:19:55,705 --> 01:19:57,248
Perfect. Beautiful.

1130
01:20:14,015 --> 01:20:14,933
lt's in.

1131
01:20:15,433 --> 01:20:17,727
Great! OK, l'm after it.

1132
01:20:28,822 --> 01:20:29,656
We're in business!

1133
01:20:30,156 --> 01:20:32,409
Now just sittight
and don'tworry!

1134
01:21:04,190 --> 01:21:05,692
And the winner is...

1135
01:21:07,569 --> 01:21:10,155
Oh, man. Lt's a cop.

1136
01:21:10,655 --> 01:21:12,073
Whatthe hell?

1137
01:21:20,665 --> 01:21:22,709
Son of a bitch.

1138
01:21:36,598 --> 01:21:39,559
Hey, Mr. Shepard.
How are you?

1139
01:21:40,060 --> 01:21:41,311
Who's that?
Oh, hi, Detective.

1140
01:21:41,811 --> 01:21:43,980
l just came by to wrapthings up
overthere.

1141
01:21:44,481 --> 01:21:45,523
Thought l'd say hello.

1142
01:21:46,024 --> 01:21:48,860
Glad you did. Come on in.

1143
01:21:49,361 --> 01:21:50,820
Thankyou.

1144
01:21:53,239 --> 01:21:55,909
- Buy you a cup of coffee?
- Sure.

1145
01:21:56,368 --> 01:21:58,286
Black? Sugar? Milk?

1146
01:21:58,787 --> 01:22:00,455
You know. Lt's all good.

1147
01:22:00,956 --> 01:22:02,707
You'll get black.

1148
01:22:07,712 --> 01:22:08,838
Fresh pot.

1149
01:22:10,382 --> 01:22:11,383
You know Jack?

1150
01:22:11,883 --> 01:22:14,094
No. Not really.
He still on the job?

1151
01:22:14,594 --> 01:22:16,638
He does a little P.l. Work
now and then...

1152
01:22:17,138 --> 01:22:18,306
but he's mostly retired.

1153
01:22:18,807 --> 01:22:22,060
Livin' off his pension, huh?

1154
01:22:23,478 --> 01:22:26,022
Jack got caught up
in them Knapp hearings.

1155
01:22:26,523 --> 01:22:29,859
Set up by some dirty cops
who needed afall guy.

1156
01:22:30,360 --> 01:22:33,238
Hurt him bad. Would have
broke his mother's heart.

1157
01:22:33,738 --> 01:22:34,447
ls she around?

1158
01:22:34,948 --> 01:22:36,032
- Who?
- Yourwife.

1159
01:22:36,533 --> 01:22:40,704
No. She passed on.
Long time ago.

1160
01:22:42,497 --> 01:22:46,126
Long time ago.

1161
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:51,590
l'm sorry.

1162
01:22:52,090 --> 01:22:53,967
That's OK.

1163
01:23:00,890 --> 01:23:03,226
Can l ask how she died?

1164
01:23:08,815 --> 01:23:11,067
Well, she...

1165
01:23:12,777 --> 01:23:15,280
she was murdered, Detective.

1166
01:23:15,780 --> 01:23:17,824
An ugly one,
to tell you the truth.

1167
01:23:18,325 --> 01:23:19,242
Mother of a cop...

1168
01:23:19,743 --> 01:23:22,412
and they neverfound
the bastard who did it.

1169
01:23:57,489 --> 01:23:59,240
You on the job?

1170
01:24:03,578 --> 01:24:05,747
A long time ago.

1171
01:24:06,247 --> 01:24:07,165
Do l know you?

1172
01:24:07,666 --> 01:24:08,583
l lookfamiliar?

1173
01:24:09,084 --> 01:24:10,335
What house you work?

1174
01:24:10,835 --> 01:24:11,795
The 7-4 Homicide.

1175
01:24:12,295 --> 01:24:14,256
A hotshot.

1176
01:24:14,756 --> 01:24:16,299
No,just...working the job.

1177
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:17,842
Yeah, l hearthat, pal.

1178
01:24:18,343 --> 01:24:19,302
As a matter offact...

1179
01:24:19,803 --> 01:24:22,681
l caught a case
that goes backto your day.

1180
01:24:23,181 --> 01:24:24,641
One of the Nightingale murders.

1181
01:24:25,141 --> 01:24:26,268
No kidding?

1182
01:24:26,768 --> 01:24:30,647
No. Missing teenager.
Disappeared back in'68.

1183
01:24:31,147 --> 01:24:32,607
Theyfound her bones
lastweek...

1184
01:24:33,108 --> 01:24:35,485
buried behind some diner
out by Dyckman Street.

1185
01:24:35,986 --> 01:24:37,404
Mary Finelli.

1186
01:24:37,904 --> 01:24:39,155
Yeah,talk about dumb luck.

1187
01:24:39,656 --> 01:24:41,491
The odds of anybodyfindin'
that girl thirty years later...

1188
01:24:41,992 --> 01:24:44,119
and the chances of hittin'
a dental...

1189
01:24:44,619 --> 01:24:45,870
Forget about it.

1190
01:24:46,371 --> 01:24:48,123
The best part is,
she's thefirstvictim.

1191
01:24:48,623 --> 01:24:51,167
And she knew the killer.
So...

1192
01:24:51,668 --> 01:24:55,130
l'm bettin' those old bones
are gonna do a lot of talkin'.

1193
01:24:58,174 --> 01:25:00,677
Notfor nothin'.
The past is afunny thing.

1194
01:25:01,177 --> 01:25:02,721
We all have skeletons
in the closet.

1195
01:25:03,221 --> 01:25:06,266
You never know when they'll
pop up and bite you in the ass.

1196
01:25:06,766 --> 01:25:08,810
Huh,Jack?

1197
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:13,440
You changed your m.o.

1198
01:25:13,940 --> 01:25:15,942
'Cause if they knew your mother
was a Nightingale...

1199
01:25:16,443 --> 01:25:17,902
they would've
looked atthefamily.

1200
01:25:18,403 --> 01:25:20,864
They would've looked atyou.

1201
01:25:26,202 --> 01:25:28,330
What are you looking at?

1202
01:25:28,830 --> 01:25:30,957
Stealing your life away.

1203
01:25:31,458 --> 01:25:33,585
You went down thirty years ago,
pal.

1204
01:25:34,085 --> 01:25:36,463
You just don't know ityet.

1205
01:26:02,656 --> 01:26:04,532
A cop? He's a cop?

1206
01:26:05,033 --> 01:26:06,618
What am l supposed to do
with that?

1207
01:26:07,118 --> 01:26:08,662
Call the F.B.l.
Use a pay phone.

1208
01:26:09,162 --> 01:26:10,830
Don't give'em your name, Dad.

1209
01:26:11,331 --> 01:26:14,251
Tell them Shepard killed Finelli
and Clark and the others...

1210
01:26:14,751 --> 01:26:15,502
that he's the Nightingale.

1211
01:26:16,002 --> 01:26:17,921
Then,tell'em
where Finelli's buried.

1212
01:26:18,421 --> 01:26:20,215
They'll be able to connect him
to her.

1213
01:26:20,715 --> 01:26:23,009
They search his place,
they'llfind some souvenirs.

1214
01:26:23,510 --> 01:26:26,471
He always took a piece of
jewelleryfrom his victims.

1215
01:26:30,850 --> 01:26:32,978
What are you doing here?
Are you off today?

1216
01:26:33,478 --> 01:26:34,354
We need to have a conversation.

1217
01:26:34,854 --> 01:26:36,523
- Dad?
- Hang on a sec,John.

1218
01:26:37,023 --> 01:26:40,110
l'm kind of in the middle
of something important here.

1219
01:26:40,610 --> 01:26:42,904
- Mind if we do this...
- l'm sorry, Frank.

1220
01:26:43,405 --> 01:26:45,282
We need to step outside
right now.

1221
01:26:45,782 --> 01:26:47,075
Dad,what's going on?

1222
01:26:47,575 --> 01:26:52,038
John, Satch is here,
and he's with his partner.

1223
01:26:52,539 --> 01:26:54,124
Whatthe hell's goin' on?

1224
01:26:54,624 --> 01:26:55,458
Hang on a sec.

1225
01:26:55,959 --> 01:26:57,043
What's your partner doin' here?

1226
01:26:57,544 --> 01:26:58,587
What happened to your eye?

1227
01:26:59,087 --> 01:27:00,297
l banged it up.

1228
01:27:00,797 --> 01:27:03,633
Let's go outside and talk.
We need to do that.

1229
01:27:04,134 --> 01:27:05,051
Aboutwhat?

1230
01:27:05,552 --> 01:27:07,220
Let's go,
do us both afavour, huh?

1231
01:27:07,721 --> 01:27:09,389
All right.

1232
01:27:11,474 --> 01:27:13,852
Stay there,John.
l'll be right back.

1233
01:27:16,563 --> 01:27:19,024
Be right back. All right?

1234
01:27:31,661 --> 01:27:34,205
Where were you last night,
Frank?

1235
01:27:35,915 --> 01:27:38,501
Where do you think l was, Satch?

1236
01:27:39,711 --> 01:27:41,379
Same place lfound this.

1237
01:27:42,923 --> 01:27:45,300
Underthe body of a dead woman.

1238
01:27:47,802 --> 01:27:51,181
No. This isn't
whatyou think, OK?

1239
01:27:52,432 --> 01:27:53,516
This isn'twhatyou think.

1240
01:27:54,017 --> 01:27:55,352
l wantto be wrong here.

1241
01:27:55,852 --> 01:27:58,355
Let's take a ride
to the precinct and talk.

1242
01:27:58,855 --> 01:28:00,941
l wantto talkto you,too.
l need to talkto you.

1243
01:28:01,441 --> 01:28:02,484
Come on.
We'll take a ride.

1244
01:28:02,984 --> 01:28:05,111
Let me just go inside,
tell myfamily where l'm going.

1245
01:28:05,612 --> 01:28:07,822
All right?
Be right back.

1246
01:28:11,117 --> 01:28:12,786
Everything's all right.
Don'tworry.

1247
01:28:19,626 --> 01:28:21,670
Chief,you there?

Theyfound Sissy Clark.
They think l did it.

1249
01:28:24,506 --> 01:28:27,425
Just give me a second.
You've gotto talkto Satch!

1250
01:28:29,678 --> 01:28:30,428
What's going on?

1251
01:28:30,929 --> 01:28:32,180
Uncle Satch, stop.

1252
01:28:32,681 --> 01:28:34,599
What's going on?

1253
01:29:05,755 --> 01:29:09,050
- He's a cop.
- A cop?

1254
01:29:11,428 --> 01:29:12,971
Jack Shepard.

1255
01:29:13,471 --> 01:29:15,307
He's a detective
atthe 15th Precinct.

1256
01:29:15,807 --> 01:29:16,766
l swear, Satch.

1257
01:29:17,267 --> 01:29:20,270
And you got all of this
from the guy on the radio.

1258
01:29:20,770 --> 01:29:22,355
From your son in thefuture.

1259
01:29:22,856 --> 01:29:25,567
Yeah.
As nuts as that sounds,yeah.

1260
01:29:28,111 --> 01:29:31,781
You gotta listen to me, Satch.
You gotta open upyour mind...

1261
01:29:32,282 --> 01:29:33,867
You gotta understand
what l'm saying.

1262
01:29:34,367 --> 01:29:35,910
You got something
going on with this girl...

1263
01:29:36,411 --> 01:29:37,203
that's one thing.

1264
01:29:37,704 --> 01:29:40,206
Butyou gotta tell me.

1265
01:29:42,167 --> 01:29:44,961
Are you listening to me?
You're in a world of shit.

1266
01:29:45,462 --> 01:29:48,423
An eyewitness putyou outside
the dead girl's apartment.

1267
01:29:48,924 --> 01:29:50,258
Your prints
are all overthe place...

1268
01:29:50,759 --> 01:29:52,552
notto mention
the goddamn driver's licence.

1269
01:29:53,053 --> 01:29:55,347
Chuck is getting
a search warrantforyour house.

1270
01:29:55,847 --> 01:29:57,974
- What's he gonnafind there?
- Nothin'.

1271
01:29:58,475 --> 01:30:02,270
You gotta give me somethin',
somethin' l can believe.

1272
01:30:13,156 --> 01:30:15,241
What if l can prove itto you?

1273
01:30:15,742 --> 01:30:16,493
How's that?

1274
01:30:16,993 --> 01:30:18,870
World Series.
Where are they right now?

1275
01:30:19,371 --> 01:30:20,664
What,fourth,fifth inning?

1276
01:30:22,082 --> 01:30:24,209
What if l was to tell you...

1277
01:30:24,709 --> 01:30:26,836
that in the bottom
of the sixth inning...

1278
01:30:27,337 --> 01:30:29,464
the Mets
are gonna be down three-zip?

1279
01:30:29,965 --> 01:30:31,925
And Cleon Jones,
he's going to come to bat.

1280
01:30:32,425 --> 01:30:36,680
He's gonna get hit in thefoot
by a wild pitch.

1281
01:30:37,180 --> 01:30:40,016
And it's gonna leave
a shoe polish mark on the ball.

1282
01:30:40,517 --> 01:30:42,519
Hear me out, all right?

1283
01:30:43,019 --> 01:30:45,730
He goes tofirst.
Clendendon comes up.

1284
01:30:46,231 --> 01:30:49,067
He's gonna hit a two-two pitch
into the left-field bleachers.

1285
01:30:49,567 --> 01:30:50,402
This is insane, Frank.

1286
01:30:50,902 --> 01:30:54,155
ln the bottom of the seventh,
Weis hits a solo home run...

1287
01:30:54,656 --> 01:30:56,950
and then Jones and Swoboda
score in the eighth.

1288
01:30:57,450 --> 01:30:59,286
The Mets,they're gonna win,
five to three.

1289
01:30:59,786 --> 01:31:01,413
Go watch.
lf it don't happen, l'm a liar.

1290
01:31:01,913 --> 01:31:03,290
Watch the game?

1291
01:31:03,790 --> 01:31:05,208
Watch the game!

1292
01:31:05,709 --> 01:31:08,461
Frank,they're gonna make you
for Sissy Clark's murder.

1293
01:31:08,962 --> 01:31:11,965
And they're gonna match that
with the Nightingale murders.

1294
01:31:12,465 --> 01:31:15,468
Do you understand
whatthat means?

1295
01:31:16,886 --> 01:31:20,223
His wife is here.
She wants to talkto you.

1296
01:31:59,346 --> 01:32:03,642
One-two pitch to Anderson.
Fly ball to right.

1297
01:32:04,142 --> 01:32:07,354
Let's walk,Jules.
Get a cup of coffee.

1298
01:32:11,900 --> 01:32:14,069
The guy went crazy.
Know what l mean?

1299
01:32:14,569 --> 01:32:17,614
Started tearin' things apart.

1300
01:32:18,114 --> 01:32:20,158
Throwing things.

1301
01:32:32,420 --> 01:32:33,880
How you doin'?

1302
01:32:34,381 --> 01:32:37,884
You got a collar in here
forthe Nightingale murders?

1303
01:32:49,938 --> 01:32:54,276
Everything OK
with you and Frank?

1304
01:32:54,776 --> 01:32:58,446
Yeah,we're good. He works hard.
l work hard. We're good.

1305
01:32:58,947 --> 01:33:00,740
Who's Sissy Clark, Satch?

1306
01:33:05,328 --> 01:33:08,123
Do you know where
Frankwas last night?

1307
01:33:08,623 --> 01:33:11,626
Yeah. He was workin'.
He had a tour.

1308
01:33:38,612 --> 01:33:40,697
Sit down.

1309
01:33:43,408 --> 01:33:45,744
Did you just hearwhat l said?

1310
01:33:57,881 --> 01:33:59,841
So how'd you know?

1311
01:34:01,885 --> 01:34:04,137
- How you doin'?
- What's up in here?

1312
01:34:04,638 --> 01:34:05,680
Shut up, asshole!

1313
01:34:06,181 --> 01:34:08,725
He tried to kill me!
Gofind Satch!

1314
01:34:09,225 --> 01:34:12,354
Find Satch!
He's trying to kill me!

1315
01:34:15,315 --> 01:34:17,859
What are you doin'
with my collar?

1316
01:34:19,569 --> 01:34:22,489
Sorry, pal. L didn't mean
to step on yourtoes.

1317
01:34:22,989 --> 01:34:24,074
They sent me up
from downstairs.

1318
01:34:24,574 --> 01:34:25,742
l thoughtyou'd be in there
with him.

1319
01:34:26,242 --> 01:34:27,953
What are you looking at himfor?

1320
01:34:28,453 --> 01:34:32,791
He matches a description
of an armed-robbery suspect.

1321
01:34:33,291 --> 01:34:35,085
So tell me aboutthe radio.

1322
01:34:35,585 --> 01:34:37,212
Who's he talking to
on thatthing?

1323
01:34:37,712 --> 01:34:39,464
John. He's a cop.

1324
01:34:39,965 --> 01:34:42,509
He talks to him all the time.
l've talked to him,too.

1325
01:34:43,009 --> 01:34:45,971
You talked to Johnny
on the radio?

1326
01:34:47,430 --> 01:34:48,890
John. What's going on, Satch?

1327
01:34:49,391 --> 01:34:50,684
You come into my house,
take Frank...

1328
01:34:51,184 --> 01:34:53,603
and now you're talking to me
like a cop.

1329
01:34:56,231 --> 01:34:58,149
l'm talking to you as afriend.

1330
01:34:58,650 --> 01:35:02,612
'Cause as a cop,
l wouldn't be here at all.

1331
01:35:05,615 --> 01:35:09,703
Listen,Jules,they're gonna
take me off this case.

1332
01:35:10,203 --> 01:35:14,124
Then Frank is gonna tell them
what he's been telling me.

1333
01:35:15,875 --> 01:35:19,796
And then nobody is gonna
be able to help him. OK?

1334
01:35:20,297 --> 01:35:22,465
...leftfield, and Cleon Jones
makes the catch.

1335
01:35:24,926 --> 01:35:27,012
Half the uniforms are either
atthe game or on the street.

1336
01:35:27,512 --> 01:35:29,014
lt's gonna be a riot
if they pull it off.

1337
01:35:29,514 --> 01:35:32,017
What is he telling us, Satch?

1338
01:35:32,517 --> 01:35:35,937
That he's talking to Johnny
on the radio.

1339
01:35:36,438 --> 01:35:38,565
Yeah. John the cop.
l told you that.

1340
01:35:39,065 --> 01:35:44,487
No. He says thatJohn
is your son,Johnny.

1341
01:35:44,988 --> 01:35:48,199
Little Johnny on the radio
in thefuture.

1342
01:35:48,700 --> 01:35:50,535
On the radio. You see?

1343
01:35:53,288 --> 01:35:56,374
No. You misunderstood him.

1344
01:36:11,765 --> 01:36:14,309
Jules? Sissy Clark?

1345
01:36:16,102 --> 01:36:20,065
She's a nurse,
and she was murdered yesterday.

1346
01:36:22,108 --> 01:36:23,568
And Frank is connected.

1347
01:36:24,069 --> 01:36:25,654
He is either
a material witness...

1348
01:36:26,154 --> 01:36:29,115
or an accomplice
orthe perpetrator.

1349
01:36:33,536 --> 01:36:36,623
...McNally,who's been
thoroughly in command.

1350
01:36:42,629 --> 01:36:47,509
Cleon starts down tofirst base,
and DeMiro calls him back.

1351
01:36:50,887 --> 01:36:54,099
Satch,you know him. You know
he didn't do this, right?

1352
01:36:56,601 --> 01:36:58,186
Hodges showing the baseball
to DeMiro.

1353
01:36:58,687 --> 01:36:59,688
Can l see him?

1354
01:37:00,188 --> 01:37:02,232
Hodges...We might have
a shoe polish play here.

1355
01:37:02,732 --> 01:37:04,734
Rememberthe Nippy Jones
shoe polish play...

1356
01:37:05,235 --> 01:37:07,529
in the 1957 World Series
at Milwaukee?

1357
01:37:08,738 --> 01:37:12,284
Hodges showing itto Lou DeMiro,
who awardsfirst base!

1358
01:37:16,329 --> 01:37:17,497
My God.

1359
01:37:19,416 --> 01:37:21,042
Satch,what's going on?

1360
01:37:21,543 --> 01:37:24,087
Mind if l go back
atthefireboyfor a while?

1361

l justwantto see
what he's got.

1362
01:37:26,423 --> 01:37:28,550
Jesus.

1363
01:38:42,415 --> 01:38:44,209
Way back in leftfield.

1364
01:43:58,898 --> 01:44:00,942
Hey, bud.

1365
01:44:21,379 --> 01:44:23,298
See if aviation's got
a helicopter.

1366
01:44:23,798 --> 01:44:25,842
Respond to my location
for commencing an air search...

1367
01:44:26,343 --> 01:44:29,054
for body in water, OK?

1368
01:44:55,205 --> 01:44:57,582

forthe Mets and Series M.V.P.
first baseman Donn Clendendon.

1370
01:45:02,420 --> 01:45:05,840
Forthe Metsfaithful,
the New Yorkfans...Wow.

1371
01:45:06,341 --> 01:45:07,926
With the streets of midtown
and Times Square...

1372
01:45:08,426 --> 01:45:10,595
still packed
with celebratingfans...

1373
01:45:21,690 --> 01:45:23,817
Here's your coffee
and your cigarettes.

1374
01:45:27,404 --> 01:45:29,739
ln the skies over New York...

1375
01:45:30,240 --> 01:45:32,242
another amazing event
is coming to a close.

1376
01:45:32,742 --> 01:45:34,619
lt's time to say goodbye
to the northern lights...

1377
01:45:35,120 --> 01:45:35,870

1378
01:45:36,371 --> 01:45:38,832
...that have been
lighting upthe skies.

1379
01:45:39,332 --> 01:45:40,834
Astronomists say
the incredible sun storms...

1380
01:45:41,334 --> 01:45:43,253
that have created the remarkable
aurora borealis...

1381
01:45:43,753 --> 01:45:44,963
have begun to cool...

1382
01:45:45,463 --> 01:45:47,132
and the auroras,
already dimming...

1383
01:45:47,632 --> 01:45:49,551
will be over by morning.

1384
01:46:26,296 --> 01:46:27,964
John, are you there?

1385
01:46:28,465 --> 01:46:29,549
John, l'm back.

1386
01:46:30,050 --> 01:46:31,301

Something's wrong.

What? What's wrong?

1392
01:46:46,316 --> 01:46:49,027
lf we stopped him,
why isn't Mom here?

1393
01:46:49,527 --> 01:46:52,697
Why don't l remember her
being OK?

1394
01:46:53,198 --> 01:46:56,576
But...l killed him.
He's dead.

1395
01:47:02,624 --> 01:47:06,253
My turn to steal your life away.

1396
01:47:06,753 --> 01:47:08,672
John, are you there?

1397
01:47:50,380 --> 01:47:52,215
Hey, bud.

1398

1399
01:48:34,841 --> 01:48:35,926
Oh,Julia.

1400
01:48:36,426 --> 01:48:37,802
Mommy?

1401
01:49:00,408 --> 01:49:04,579
Hey. Lt's OK.
lt's OK,you little rascal.

1402
01:49:07,332 --> 01:49:09,292
What are you gonna do, Frank?

1403
01:49:09,793 --> 01:49:10,961
Putthe gun down.

1404
01:49:11,461 --> 01:49:12,212
Let him go.

1405
01:49:12,712 --> 01:49:15,382
Well, putthe gun down.

1406

l'll snap his neck.
Putthe gun down now.

1407
01:49:35,902 --> 01:49:39,823
Time to die, Sullivan.
