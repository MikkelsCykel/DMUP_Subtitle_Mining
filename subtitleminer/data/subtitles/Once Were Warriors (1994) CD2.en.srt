00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:24,410
You're still a bloody
attractive woman.

2
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:27,530
You mean after you
take to me with your fists?

3
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:29,410
You make me sick.

4
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:32,450
Oh, hon, you still
on about the other week?

5
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:35,010
I told you,
I'm sorry.

6
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:38,050
And I told you when I get like that,
get out of my way.

7
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:40,730
But you have to get all lippy on me.

8
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:43,010
I got a temper on me,
but who hasn't?

9
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:45,770
You're priceless.

10
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:48,970
Well, at least
I try to make it up to you.

11
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:51,410
Get off me, Jake.

12
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:54,290
Oh, you're a hard lady.

13
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:56,890
Hey, where do you think you're going?

14
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:58,970
Sit down and keep a man company.

15
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:01,170
I've got things to think about.

16
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:02,330
Like what?

17
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:04,770
Since when were you interested?

18
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:07,610
Well, if you can't tell by the way
I just grabbed you...

19
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:08,850
...I must be losing my touch.

20
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:10,250
If you're not gonna take me
seriously, Jake...

21
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:13,530
Take it easy.
Talk to Jakey.

22
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:21,770
It's just...

23
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:24,450
It's just what?

24
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:27,770
Jeez,
you're pretty.

25
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:37,530
I want us to visit Boogie.

26
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:39,410
Is that all?

27
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:43,210
Go together,
as a family.

28
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:45,050
You know,
make a day of it...

29
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:47,130
...take up a nice picnic lunch.

30
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:49,210
Maybe we could rent
a car for the day.

31
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:51,530
Oh, yeah. Maybe we could fuckin' fly.

32
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:53,290
It's not impossible, Jake.

33
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:55,170
I've worked it out.

34
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:57,850
There's the money Auntie Matawai
sent me at Christmas.

35
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:01,010
If I put a bit aside each week
from the housekeeping...

36
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:03,410
...in a month,
maybe we could go.

37
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:05,650
Please, Jake?

38
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:10,210
And this whole day
means a lot to you, huh?

39
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:11,610
Yes.

40
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:19,690
Book the fuckin' limousine.

41
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:23,370
Horses, babe.

42
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:25,090
Honest.

43
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:32,210
Now, will you come here?

44
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:42,090
Tell Jakey you love him.

45
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:49,570
That's the trouble,
Jake. I do.

46
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:58,290
- What's going on?
- It's Heke, sir.

47
00:02:58,370 --> 00:02:59,810
He's got your taiaha, sir.

48
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:06,610
If you want to smash things, boy,
you start with me!

49
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:11,410
You think you're man enough
to hold a taiaha, boy?

50
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:14,170
- I hate this fucking place!
- You're not supposed to like it!

51
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:17,090
Let me go,
you black bastard!

52
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:20,370
We are the same color, boy!

53
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:41,650
The British used to think
the bayonet was the most lethal...

54
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:43,730
...of all hand-to-hand
combat weapons...

55
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:48,210
...till they came across our warriors,
who fought with a taiaha.

56
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:52,490
You think your fist is your weapon?

57
00:03:57,890 --> 00:03:59,250
When I have taught you...

58
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:01,170
...your mind will be.

59
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:04,690
You'll carry your taiaha inside you.

60
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:07,250
Come on.

61
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:16,850
Whoa, this is the life, eh, kids?

62
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:19,010
Don't even have to change gears.

63
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:46,690
Want to come and visit
your brother, son?

64
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:50,770
Nah. Got something else on.

65
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:53,330
Oh, come on, son...
as a family.

66
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:59,650
What? Too fucking busy
to visit your own brother, boy?

67
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:01,970
Rather be with a pack of wankers.

68
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:13,090
He would have come, Jake,
if you would have waited.

69
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:14,770
He would have.

70
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:22,570
Visits don't start till after lunch.
We may as well take a drive, eh, kids?

71
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:24,450
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

72
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:25,890
What's that place over there, Mum?

73
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:27,810
Taku Whenua Tuturu.

74
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:31,050
My piece of dirt.

75
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:33,330
That's where I was brought up, kids.

76
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:36,050
What's that big house over there, Mum?

77
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:37,850
That's the Wharenui.

78
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:40,170
It was a lot different
when I was a girl.

79
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:41,890
It was always impressive.

80
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:43,690
What's impressive?

81
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:45,770
Choice.

82
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:47,650
It was always choice.

83
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:50,770
And inside are
the most choicest carvings.

84
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:54,450
Go on, Mum.

85
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:57,450
Oh, and inside
are photos of the old people...

86
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:59,490
...and the Tukutuku panels.

87
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:02,890
You know, I used to help Nannie
and Auntie Matawai repair them.

88
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:05,770
Well, why don't we
ever go there, Mum?

89
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:11,050
One day we'll all end up there.

90
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:12,490
See over there to the right?

91
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:14,210
That's the Urupa...

92
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:15,810
...the family cemetery.

93
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:18,930
All my family are buried there.

94
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:20,970
I'd love to go and see them.

95
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:23,690
Not before me,
you don't.

96
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:28,770
Your father and I were going to
get hitched there.

97
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:32,010
Except we didn't.

98
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:36,530
I wasn't bloody good enough...

99
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:41,890
...not for their royal highness.
Tell them everything, why don't you?

100
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:50,250
Your mother was beautiful...

101
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:54,330
...pride of the fucking tribe...

102
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:59,370
And this old black-ass comes along
and steals her away.

103
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:02,490
And you know where
I come from, kids?

104
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:05,610
A long line of slaves.

105
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:13,370
Fucking slaves.

106
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:19,170
I'd like to see those wankers
call Jake the Muss that now.

107
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:28,930
Ah, this place gives me the creeps.

108
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:31,290
Come on, kids.

109
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:35,330
Doesn't give me the creeps.

110
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:37,210
You never met my grandmother.

111
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:38,250
Eh, Jake?

112
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:58,530
Just want to show
our flash car to my mates.

113
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:02,330
Whoa, bro, you know what
the penalty is for car theft?

114
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:08,530
Just one beer, huh?

115
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:10,850
One, Jake.

116
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:12,130
Just the one.

117
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:13,530
Promise?

118
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:16,970
Cross my heart.

119
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:22,290
Cheer.

120
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:25,170
- Cheer.
- Ah, cheer.

121
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:26,650
Cheer, bro.

122
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:28,770
- Cheer.
- Cheer.

123
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:33,890
How long is Dad gonna be?

124
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:37,050
I'd get that tone out of your voice
if I were you.

125
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:40,810
How many times have you seen
your father like today, Grace?

126
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:43,530
Never...
that's how many...

127
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:45,290
...so just give him a chance, eh?

128
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:52,010
Bethie!
Name your poison.

129
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:53,650
Oh, no, thanks,
Dooley.

130
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:55,850
Jake and I are going to
visit our son Boogie.

131
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:57,290
- Aren't we, Jake?
- Yeah, yeah. Just a minute.

132
00:09:57,410 --> 00:09:58,850
I'm trying to listen to
the horse race here.

133
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:00,050
You promised, Jake.

134
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:02,490
Shut up, woman. You'll make me miss
who won the fuckin' race.

135
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:04,050
The kids are hungry.

136
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:06,450
Well, feed them.
You got bootloads of the stuff.

137
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:08,770
We'll be waiting.

138
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:11,610
Come on, come on.
Come up, come up.

139
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:24,970
So he's not coming?

140
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:26,850
Oh, he's coming,
all right.

141
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:28,930
You're hopeful.

142
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:30,290
No, Grace.

143
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:32,250
It's just a woman's lot, that's all.

144
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:35,650
One day you'll understand.

145
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:13,330
No, no, no,
no, no, no.

146
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:14,650
Stop, stop.

147
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:17,570
It's good, but it's
not good enough!

148
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:20,690
I've told you fellas time and again,
this haka won't work...

149
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:23,250
...until you get
the first action right!

150
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:27,410
You're reaching up
for all these ancestral lines...

151
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:30,250
...and you're pulling them
down into your body!

152
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:33,010
The weight of your ancestors.

153
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:36,410
Some of you look as though you're
reaching for butterflies or something.

154
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:38,490
Now, let's do it again...

155
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:41,330
...and wake up!

156
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:57,010
- Give me the keys, Jake.
- What?

157
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:59,130
I said, give me the keys.

158
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:00,370
What for?

159
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:01,890
I'm going to visit Boogie.

160
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:03,330
Bad idea.

161
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:05,930
The problem is you've spoiled the boy.
You've got to toughen him up.

162
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:09,010
- Give me the bloody keys!
- That's it, woman. Just fuck off!

163
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:12,130
Take a bloody taxi.
You got all my bloody money.

164
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:20,530
Fuck.

165
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:40,570
Come on, kids.
We'll walk around to the taxi stand.

166
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:42,450
Taxi? What for?

167
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:44,570
We're going home.

168
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:46,650
No. We're going to see Boogie.
You promised.

169
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:49,170
Please, Grace,
try to understand.

170
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:51,610
I don't want to listen
to any more of your lies.

171
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:54,050
I hate you!
I hate you both!

172
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:03,290
Come on, kids.

173
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:21,010
Boogie? Son?

174
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:22,650
We were on our way.

175
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:25,090
We rented a car for the trip.

176
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:28,410
We had a bit of an accident, son.

177
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:32,610
Oh, well, you know what your father's like
when he gets behind the wheel.

178
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:36,090
Had a picnic lunch all prepared.

179
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:38,210
Stayed up all last night.

180
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:40,610
I got in just what you like.

181
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:47,610
It was just a stupid accident.

182
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,130
Whoa. Party at
my place tonight, boys.

183
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:39,290
Fuck. I need to piss.

184
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:41,810
Thanks, mate.
We really needed to know that.

185
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:53,730
Bethie, you awake?

186
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:55,570
Come party with us.

187
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:57,410
No.

188
00:14:58,330 --> 00:14:59,730
No more, Jake.

189
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:15,130
I could tell straightaway it was a holding.
What's more, it's my mate's holding.

190
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:16,610
Next thing I know,
I give him a smack.

191
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:19,570
Oh, if it isn't Gracie.

192
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:21,170
Hu wanted some water.

193
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:23,370
Come and give your uncle a kiss.

194
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,770
You're growing up fast, girl.

195
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:36,970
- Where is Mum?
- She's in bed, where you should be.

196
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:39,610
- What happened then, Jake?
- He comes back at me with this crowbar.

197
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:40,730
Yeah? And then what?

198
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:43,490
I take the crowbar off him
and give him another smack.

199
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:45,770
Good night, Hu.

200
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:47,370
Night-night.

201
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:24,930
It's OK, Gracie.

202
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:26,890
Uncle Bully is going
to be gentle with you...

203
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:28,410
...as gentle as a lamb.

204
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:42,450
Your mum and dad are going to be
real angry at you, turning me on like that...

205
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:45,490
...coming downstairs in nothing
but that flimsy little nightie.

206
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:50,770
It's our secret,
hey, Gracie?

207
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:54,650
You hear me, girl?

208
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:57,090
Keep your mouth shut.

209
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:45,650
Did Huata wet the bed again, Bub?

210
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:48,970
You should have left it.
I'd have done that.

211
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:50,810
Just go away.

212
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:52,570
Go away.

213
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:54,530
Look, I don't blame you, Grace.

214
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:57,090
I wanted to see Boogie as much as you.

215
00:19:57,290 --> 00:19:59,090
You don't care about any of us.

216
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:01,370
That's not true.
I love you all.

217
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:03,010
But you're a liar!

218
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:07,410
Go on...

219
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:09,810
...got your period, Bub.

220
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:12,090
It's bound to make you
a bit uptight...

221
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:14,330
Get out! Get out!

222
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:35,090
What's for breakfast?

223
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:37,010
You want something to eat,

224
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:38,250
...fix it yourself.

225
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:39,850
Give me a coffee.

226
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:41,970
Go and have a wash, Jake.

227
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:44,290
Clean your ears out
while you're at it.

228
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:46,930
What the fuck's up with you?

229
00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:51,450
I'm not going to take this anymore.

230
00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:54,450
Do you hear me,
Jake Heke?

231
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:56,210
No more.

232
00:20:56,930 --> 00:20:58,290
We never got to see Boogie.

233
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:02,130
I don't want any more
of these drunken parties...

234
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:04,610
...or your bloody ugly
mongrel mates coming around.

235
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,250
It's no good...

236
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:08,250
...no good for the kids...

237
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:11,130
...especially now Grace is growing.

238
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:17,570
Who the fuck do you think you are, eh?

239
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:21,250
Sitting there like
Lady Bloody Muck...

240
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:25,090
...telling me in my own house
who I can and can't have here.

241
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:29,650
Well, I've asked them back tonight,
and you'd better be ready for it.

242
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:30,850
Do you hear me?!

243
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:34,930
Now, get off your fat ass
and get busy.

244
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:36,850
Oh, Grace!

245
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:39,450
Leave that girl alone! You know, that's
your problem. You spoil the lot of them!

246
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:41,370
No wonder they're all
so fucking screwed up!

247
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:44,570
It's got nothing to do with you,
eh, Jake Heke?

248
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:46,970
You're such good father material!

249
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:48,770
You chased Nig off!

250
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:51,850
You couldn't give a damn
about Boogie!

251
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:58,010
You're not gonna
hurt my babies anymore...

252
00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:01,730
...not while I can do
something about it.

253
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:06,170
Oh, you want something to eat?

254
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:08,770
Learn how to cook.

255
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:10,450
Grace!

256
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:14,090
Grace!

257
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:25,850
What's up?

258
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:30,210
What?

259
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:32,650
I said, what's up?

260
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:35,290
How long have you been sitting there?

261
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:43,690
Why is everything so black, Toot?

262
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:46,730
Don't know.
Maybe 'cause we're all bloody Maoris.

263
00:22:56,370 --> 00:22:57,850
You got something...

264
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:00,530
...you got something to sniff?

265
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:03,290
Yeah. A couple of old socks.
What's going on, G?

266
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:05,210
I thought you said
we were best friends.

267
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:07,010
If you're too bloody mean,
just forget it.

268
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:08,290
Hang on. Hang on.

269
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:13,570
No glue, OK? OK?

270
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:18,170
But I've got some dope.
You want some of that?

271
00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:20,330
Yeah.

272
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:32,210
What's going on with you, Bub?

273
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:38,370
What colors are you seeing now, G?

274
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:39,770
Still all black?

275
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:42,170
Nah. Not an old black in sight.

276
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:52,810
Notice how you never see black
in a rainbow, do you?

277
00:23:56,570 --> 00:23:57,970
Just bright colors.

278
00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:01,890
Must be their pot.

279
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:04,370
You know, the pot at
the end of the thing.

280
00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:06,290
Oh, dumb.

281
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:10,690
Pot... the end of the thing.

282
00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:18,250
You're shit! You're just like
everyone else around here.

283
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:20,010
I'm... I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it.

284
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:22,890
You're just a stupid kid
that lives in an old wreck of a car.

285
00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:29,130
G! G! Come back, G!

286
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:31,890
G, come back!
What did I do?

287
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:33,010
Please, G!

288
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:36,010
I'm sorry!

289
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:38,050
Please.

290
00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:10,690
Shit. It's nearly on empty.

291
00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:13,770
- I've got money.
- Forget the money. It's just no good.

292
00:26:13,890 --> 00:26:15,730
We've been driving around for hours.

293
00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:17,810
When was the last time
you phoned home?

294
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:19,570
Uh, about 9:00.

295
00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:21,330
Jeez.
It's nearly 11:00.

296
00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:52,930
Bring your ass in here, girl!

297
00:26:53,810 --> 00:26:55,330
I said in here!
Move!

298
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:04,330
Your mother's been out all day,
half the fucking night!

299
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:05,730
Now, where the fuck you been?

300
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:08,210
Come on, bro,
she's home now.

301
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:10,010
Let the kid go to bed.

302
00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:11,530
Come on, Jake.

303
00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:14,370
Play the guitar, man.

304
00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:16,490
Go on.
Piss off to bed.

305
00:27:17,290 --> 00:27:20,650
Hey, come on, give
your Uncle Bully a kiss good night.

306
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:23,050
I don't want to.

307
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:25,450
What? I didn't hear you.

308
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:27,210
I said I don't want to.

309
00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:29,490
- What, you got a hearing problem, girl?
- Hey, no. Leave it.

310
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:33,610
Daddy, no!

311
00:27:34,370 --> 00:27:35,330
Daddy!

312
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:38,050
I told you about this thing, eh?

313
00:27:38,210 --> 00:27:39,890
No fucking wonder you don't do
what you're fucking told!

314
00:27:39,970 --> 00:27:40,930
Take it easy, Jake.

315
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:42,450
She's just a kid.

316
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:48,410
Go on.
Get out of here.

317
00:27:53,810 --> 00:27:54,930
Bully,
play us a song.

318
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:56,490
Go on, dude.

319
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:23,130
Where is she?

320
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:25,850
Stop your panic, woman.
She's home.

321
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:27,610
She won't be taking off anymore.

322
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:29,130
Where is she, Jake?

323
00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:31,330
She pissed off out the back.

324
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:39,810
What the fuck?

325
00:28:48,370 --> 00:28:51,770
Some-- someone help me get her down!

326
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:54,610
Please! Please!

327
00:28:58,010 --> 00:28:59,970
Come on, baby.
Come on, girl.

328
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:01,690
It's all right, baby.

329
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:04,850
Mummy's home.
Mummy's home.

330
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:08,250
Come on, Grace.
Oh, God.

331
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:14,210
We've got to do something.

332
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:18,770
My baby!

333
00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:24,970
I'll get help.

334
00:29:38,050 --> 00:29:41,650
No, Grace!

335
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:33,010
Don't cry, Mavis.

336
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:35,450
Doesn't do any good.

337
00:31:07,970 --> 00:31:09,130
Auntie Matawai?

338
00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:11,050
It's Beth.

339
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:19,330
Ka mata oku tamahine...

340
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:23,730
...last night.

341
00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:30,530
I want to bring her home, Auntie.

342
00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:36,050
Will you come and get us, please?

343
00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:39,890
Thank you.

344
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:45,730
We're going to play spacies.

345
00:31:45,810 --> 00:31:46,810
Come on, you two.

346
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:48,290
Oh, where's Gracie?

347
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:49,970
She's having a long sleep.

348
00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:51,970
No, she's not.
Her bed's empty.

349
00:31:52,090 --> 00:31:53,730
That's enough, Polly.
Come on.

350
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:01,090
What the fuck's going on here?

351
00:32:04,930 --> 00:32:06,850
I want us to take Grace back home...

352
00:32:07,290 --> 00:32:08,730
...to the Marae.

353
00:32:09,810 --> 00:32:11,930
This is her fucking home.

354
00:32:12,090 --> 00:32:13,210
No, it's not.

355
00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:15,610
This was never her home...

356
00:32:16,010 --> 00:32:17,250
...never.

357
00:32:17,650 --> 00:32:19,290
And that fucking place is?

358
00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:23,050
Fucking Maoris who think they're better
than the rest of us?

359
00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:26,330
I hate them.

360
00:32:27,850 --> 00:32:30,490
Bastards living in the fucking past.

361
00:32:30,850 --> 00:32:32,530
It's our past, too, Jake.

362
00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:34,490
What's that supposed to mean?

363
00:32:34,650 --> 00:32:37,130
I want Grace to be with her people.

364
00:32:38,770 --> 00:32:41,370
We should have gone back
a long time ago.

365
00:32:42,050 --> 00:32:43,010
Fuck off!

366
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:44,730
You're not taking her anywhere.

367
00:32:44,850 --> 00:32:47,770
I'm taking her, Jake,
with or without you.

368
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:51,170
I wasn't there
when Grace needed me.

369
00:32:51,850 --> 00:32:54,530
This time I'm going to do
the right thing by her...

370
00:32:54,770 --> 00:32:56,610
...and you're not going to stop me.

371
00:32:56,890 --> 00:32:59,530
You fucking do, and I won't be here
when you get back.

372
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:00,970
Well, go on, then.

373
00:33:01,210 --> 00:33:03,890
Go! Get the hell out of here!

374
00:33:04,050 --> 00:33:05,610
I'm taking her.

375
00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:07,730
I'll kill you first!

376
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:12,010
Well, go on. Do it.

377
00:33:14,290 --> 00:33:16,530
You're still a slave, Jake...

378
00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:20,330
...to your fists,
to the drink...

379
00:33:20,730 --> 00:33:22,170
...to yourself.

380
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:24,170
Well, go on.

381
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:26,930
Kill the bloody lot of us!

382
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:38,570
Stay out of my fucking way...

383
00:33:40,370 --> 00:33:42,090
...or I'll kill you.

384
00:34:21,650 --> 00:34:24,890
You've come home, Grace.
We're home.

385
00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:00,770
Oh, my baby.

386
00:35:08,490 --> 00:35:10,210
Am I that much of a bastard, eh?

387
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:12,170
You're my mates.
You tell me.

388
00:35:12,330 --> 00:35:14,450
It's not too late
if you want to go to the Tangi.

389
00:35:14,610 --> 00:35:15,690
We'll drive you.

390
00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:16,890
Fuck off.

391
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:20,250
I'm not going to give them
the satisfaction.

392
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:22,650
I was never fucking good enough...

393
00:35:22,810 --> 00:35:24,530
...not for their Beth.

394
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:27,530
I'll knock her bloody head in.

395
00:35:27,650 --> 00:35:28,970
Never mind, bro.

396
00:35:30,610 --> 00:35:32,330
What's the key to her, man?

397
00:35:32,770 --> 00:35:34,650
You think I was tough on the kid?

398
00:35:34,810 --> 00:35:37,290
Nah. It wouldn't have been
just that, mate.

399
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:39,610
Bull, what do you think?

400
00:35:39,690 --> 00:35:41,170
You think I was tough on her?

401
00:35:41,570 --> 00:35:42,970
Fucked if I know, bro.

402
00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:47,970
I'll try and tell you
a story, eh, Gracie?

403
00:35:48,970 --> 00:35:50,970
The story about a young girl...

404
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:55,010
...growing up in this beautiful place.

405
00:35:57,050 --> 00:35:58,810
She was given an honor.

406
00:36:00,170 --> 00:36:02,650
She was made Puhi of the Marae.

407
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:04,930
The special one.

408
00:36:06,490 --> 00:36:10,970
Well, you see,
the girl fell in love...

409
00:36:12,010 --> 00:36:14,050
...as all young people do.

410
00:36:16,890 --> 00:36:18,770
But you see,
the problem was...

411
00:36:20,370 --> 00:36:22,810
...the old people
wouldn't agree to the fella.

412
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:28,050
The girl, being headstrong...

413
00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:30,450
...went with him anyway.

414
00:36:33,370 --> 00:36:35,370
Her father said she'd be back...

415
00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:39,770
...that when everything
went to hell, she'd be back.

416
00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:45,730
So the girl...
made a promise to herself...

417
00:36:46,850 --> 00:36:48,490
...and said she wouldn't.

418
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:51,650
No matter what,
she wouldn't.

419
00:36:54,330 --> 00:36:55,450
You see, Grace...

420
00:36:58,130 --> 00:37:00,570
...I did know how to keep a promise.

421
00:37:01,290 --> 00:37:02,410
I did.

422
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:06,930
I'm so sorry, Bub.

423
00:37:07,370 --> 00:37:09,210
I'm so sorry.

424
00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:12,130
I should have been there for you, sis.

425
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:17,970
You were always there for us.

426
00:37:21,770 --> 00:37:22,930
Oh, son.

427
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:43,690
Hey, G.

428
00:37:44,090 --> 00:37:46,530
Best friends...
forever.

429
00:37:46,770 --> 00:37:47,770
Remember?

430
00:37:55,330 --> 00:37:57,890
That's all I meant.
Honest.

431
00:37:58,730 --> 00:38:00,090
But you were right.

432
00:38:00,330 --> 00:38:03,290
I'm just a stupid kid
who lives in an old wreck of a car.

433
00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:08,330
She loved you, man.

434
00:38:10,730 --> 00:38:11,890
She loved you.

435
00:38:20,330 --> 00:38:22,810
Have you ever seen so much piss?

436
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:25,130
That's because they love you, man.

437
00:38:25,290 --> 00:38:25,970
Yeah.

438
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:28,250
Yeah. Why not?

439
00:38:29,170 --> 00:38:31,090
I'm a lovable chap.

440
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:33,970
Jake the Muss.

441
00:39:09,090 --> 00:39:10,650
Where the fuck are you?!

442
00:39:49,570 --> 00:39:51,010
You bastard!

443
00:39:51,810 --> 00:39:53,650
Fucking bastard.

444
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:01,770
Don't forget your hat,
eh, uncle?

445
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:05,210
Hey, uncle, did you
get all the ghosts?

446
00:41:05,570 --> 00:41:06,930
I sure did.

447
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:08,970
Got the whole lot of them.

448
00:41:29,050 --> 00:41:31,650
You come and stay.
Bring the kids with you.

449
00:41:31,890 --> 00:41:33,970
We've got a lot of work
to do back home.

450
00:41:34,770 --> 00:41:36,170
And here, too, auntie.

451
00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:38,770
You sort out here first.

452
00:41:49,970 --> 00:41:51,410
Be strong.

453
00:41:54,130 --> 00:41:55,610
Good-bye, auntie.

454
00:42:07,610 --> 00:42:09,810
You made me real proud today, son.

455
00:42:10,890 --> 00:42:13,730
Me, too, eh, Mum?
I made you proud today.

456
00:42:14,370 --> 00:42:16,530
You sure did, Bub.

457
00:42:18,850 --> 00:42:20,690
Well, I suppose I'd better
be taking off, then.

458
00:42:20,850 --> 00:42:22,770
Take off?
Where to?

459
00:42:22,930 --> 00:42:26,650
I dunno. Probably back to my car.
I like it there.

460
00:42:27,370 --> 00:42:30,410
Well, do you think
you could like it here, with us?

461
00:42:31,050 --> 00:42:32,850
Because we like having you.

462
00:42:33,330 --> 00:42:34,570
Don't we, kids?

463
00:42:36,970 --> 00:42:39,130
Well, whatever you say, Mrs. H.

464
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:41,770
I mean, if you need me,
that'll be great.

465
00:42:42,130 --> 00:42:43,610
I do need you.

466
00:42:44,170 --> 00:42:45,370
Need you all.

467
00:43:00,770 --> 00:43:03,050
Well, we'll say grace.

468
00:43:03,850 --> 00:43:05,210
Grace!

469
00:43:13,610 --> 00:43:15,050
Thank you for my family...

470
00:43:15,290 --> 00:43:18,090
...thank you for the food.
Amen.

471
00:43:28,970 --> 00:43:30,090
Good look, bro.

472
00:43:31,290 --> 00:43:32,810
Would you like one, bro?

473
00:43:33,290 --> 00:43:36,050
No, thanks, man.
I wear mine on the inside.

474
00:43:45,610 --> 00:43:47,770
Don't you think you should take
the car back, son?

475
00:43:48,930 --> 00:43:49,890
In the morning.

476
00:43:52,810 --> 00:43:54,570
Your mates did you proud today.

477
00:43:58,650 --> 00:43:59,570
There.

478
00:44:00,290 --> 00:44:02,250
Mrs. H, could you read me
one of G's stories?

479
00:44:02,330 --> 00:44:04,010
I can't.
That's why she reads to me.

480
00:44:04,170 --> 00:44:05,250
I mean used to.

481
00:44:05,370 --> 00:44:06,970
Yeah, the one about the Taniwha.

482
00:44:07,090 --> 00:44:08,050
OK.

483
00:44:43,450 --> 00:44:44,530
What's wrong, Mum?

484
00:44:47,450 --> 00:44:49,570
Toot, put the kids in the car.

485
00:44:49,730 --> 00:44:50,770
Thanks, bro.

486
00:44:58,610 --> 00:45:01,330
Anyway, this fucking ape
comes over to me...

487
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:04,290
...takes off his shades,
and says the classic line.

488
00:45:04,450 --> 00:45:06,730
The classic line!
Wait for it.

489
00:45:06,890 --> 00:45:08,570
Waiting, waiting, waiting.

490
00:45:08,930 --> 00:45:10,690
"What the fuck you staring at, man?"

491
00:45:11,410 --> 00:45:13,850
So I say to him, cool-ass...

492
00:45:14,290 --> 00:45:17,050
"Well, not you, mate.
Your spunky missis."

493
00:45:17,370 --> 00:45:20,290
Trouble is, she was
fucking uglier than him.

494
00:45:20,890 --> 00:45:22,330
Then all hell broke loose.

495
00:45:22,490 --> 00:45:23,770
Old Jimmy, eh?

496
00:45:25,650 --> 00:45:28,370
Hey, you can stay at
my place tonight, mate.

497
00:45:28,530 --> 00:45:30,130
Yeah, fuck it.
Why not?

498
00:45:32,010 --> 00:45:34,610
Beth!
Bully, give the lady a seat.

499
00:45:36,810 --> 00:45:39,650
- You fucking animal.
- What the fuck?

500
00:45:39,810 --> 00:45:42,890
Women and children, eh?
You fucking coward!

501
00:45:43,730 --> 00:45:45,650
Please, control your missis there, mate.

502
00:45:45,890 --> 00:45:49,050
Who the fuck do you think you are
coming in here mouthing off at my mates?

503
00:45:49,170 --> 00:45:51,690
Get the fucking hell out of here
before I kick your bloody head in.

504
00:45:51,810 --> 00:45:53,530
That's always your answer, eh, Jake?

505
00:45:53,690 --> 00:45:54,850
Violence.

506
00:45:55,330 --> 00:45:57,450
It's bad enough that you did it here...

507
00:45:57,610 --> 00:46:00,690
...but you brought it home with you
and I damn well let you.

508
00:46:00,890 --> 00:46:03,010
What the fuck are you on about now?

509
00:46:03,090 --> 00:46:05,370
It was violence that killed my Grace.

510
00:46:05,570 --> 00:46:08,090
She didn't have
an ounce of violence in her, Jake...

511
00:46:08,210 --> 00:46:10,050
...but we made damn sure
it was all around her.

512
00:46:10,210 --> 00:46:11,450
She killed herself!

513
00:46:11,570 --> 00:46:12,890
You bloody bastard!

514
00:46:13,210 --> 00:46:15,730
It was your bloody mate
who handed her the rope!

515
00:46:16,490 --> 00:46:18,530
Hey, I don't have a clue
what you're on about.

516
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:20,090
- You fucking child--
- Shut up, Nig!

517
00:46:21,330 --> 00:46:22,810
You animal.

518
00:46:22,970 --> 00:46:25,090
You raped a 13-year-old girl...

519
00:46:25,250 --> 00:46:27,210
...then sat here drinking with her father...

520
00:46:27,330 --> 00:46:29,010
...while the rest of us buried her.

521
00:46:29,130 --> 00:46:30,570
She's off her fucking head, man.

522
00:46:30,690 --> 00:46:36,130
Sneaking around my house and laying
your dirty, filthy, fucking hands on my baby!

523
00:46:36,250 --> 00:46:37,130
My Grace!

524
00:46:37,250 --> 00:46:39,490
Hey, you're not
on the fucking Marae now...

525
00:46:39,570 --> 00:46:41,810
...so don't come in here
accusing my mates of shit!

526
00:46:41,930 --> 00:46:43,010
Hey, come on, man.

527
00:46:43,130 --> 00:46:45,250
Look, no one's thinking straight.

528
00:46:45,370 --> 00:46:47,210
We're family. Right?

529
00:46:47,850 --> 00:46:50,490
Beth. Sit down.
Have a drink.

530
00:46:50,610 --> 00:46:52,730
I won't drink with you fucking animals!

531
00:46:57,930 --> 00:46:59,050
Read it.

532
00:47:16,410 --> 00:47:17,530
Uncle Bully.

533
00:47:25,530 --> 00:47:27,530
Uncle fucking Bully!

534
00:48:06,490 --> 00:48:07,650
Let's go, son.

535
00:48:11,210 --> 00:48:12,690
You dumb bastard, Bully!

536
00:48:24,170 --> 00:48:26,530
Fuck you, Beth.
Where are you going?

537
00:48:33,850 --> 00:48:35,650
I found something better, Jake...

538
00:48:35,810 --> 00:48:38,690
...and I'm going to make damn sure
my kids have it all.

539
00:48:39,170 --> 00:48:40,170
From now on...

540
00:48:40,610 --> 00:48:42,930
...I make the decisions for my family.

541
00:48:44,370 --> 00:48:45,810
Fuck off, then!

542
00:48:46,490 --> 00:48:48,370
You'll get nothing from me.

543
00:48:48,610 --> 00:48:50,330
You've got nothing I want.

544
00:48:51,210 --> 00:48:54,450
Our people once were warriors...

545
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:56,530
...but not like you, Jake.

546
00:48:56,930 --> 00:49:00,090
They were a people with mana, pride.

547
00:49:00,730 --> 00:49:02,330
People with spirit.

548
00:49:04,050 --> 00:49:07,410
If my spirit can survive
living with you for 18 years...

549
00:49:07,730 --> 00:49:09,810
...then I can survive anything.

550
00:49:10,850 --> 00:49:12,650
Maybe you taught me that.

551
00:49:16,210 --> 00:49:19,050
Oh, you are fucked, lady!
Really fucked!

552
00:49:19,610 --> 00:49:21,650
You think I need you
and your fucking spirit?

553
00:49:21,770 --> 00:49:23,770
Fuck off! Go on, go!

554
00:49:24,570 --> 00:49:26,290
I don't want you, ever!

555
00:49:26,810 --> 00:49:28,650
I'll knock your fucking head off!

556
00:49:30,090 --> 00:49:31,970
Fuck you! You'll be back.

557
00:49:32,130 --> 00:49:34,130
Fuck this warrior shit.

558
00:49:34,690 --> 00:49:35,930
You'll be back!

559
00:49:36,690 --> 00:49:39,090
Fuck you, Beth!
Do you hear me, Beth?!

560
00:49:41,610 --> 00:49:42,530
Fuck you!

561
00:49:46,290 --> 00:49:47,850
Where are we going, Mum?

562
00:49:49,570 --> 00:49:50,890
We're going home.

563
00:49:52,610 --> 00:49:56,130
Oh, fuck all that fucking warrior shit!

564
00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:59,490
You'll be back!
You'll fucking see.

565
00:49:59,610 --> 00:50:02,490
You'll need me!
You'll fucking want me!

566
00:50:02,610 --> 00:50:04,850
You'll be back.
Fuck you, Beth!

567
00:50:05,010 --> 00:50:08,330
Beth, fuck you! Beth!

568
00:50:09,330 --> 00:50:19,330
