I've been here for four years.

301
00:18:53,327 --> 00:18:56,558
Yeah. You gotta watch
where you're walking.

302
00:18:56,664 --> 00:18:59,292
It doesn't feel like four years ago.

303
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,460
I feel like just five seconds ago
I was getting wasted with you...

304
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:06,006
and going upstairs to have sex.

305
00:19:06,106 --> 00:19:09,007
Wait a minute. How come
just you're here? Where's Cindi?

306
00:19:09,109 --> 00:19:12,806
- Where's my Dad?
- Oh, his job moved him down to Florida.

307
00:19:12,913 --> 00:19:15,643
What? He left me in the hospital?

308
00:19:15,749 --> 00:19:17,478
Well, dude, you were a vegetable.

309
00:19:17,585 --> 00:19:19,610
Besides, he still has an apartment here.

310
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:22,280
- What about Cindi?
- Oh, I don't know where she is.

311
00:19:22,389 --> 00:19:27,122
- Well, give me your cell phone.
- No, I don't know where she is. She moved after graduation.

312
00:19:27,228 --> 00:19:29,696
- She left me too?
- You were a vegetable.

313
00:19:29,797 --> 00:19:31,628
Then how come you're still here?

314
00:19:31,732 --> 00:19:33,495
'Cause we're homeys, dude. Lock it up.

315
00:19:33,601 --> 00:19:35,592
I can't believe she would
just leave me like that.

316
00:19:35,703 --> 00:19:38,103
She was around for a little while...

317
00:19:38,205 --> 00:19:41,971
but then she got into college and it really
didn't look like you were gonna wake up.

318
00:19:42,076 --> 00:19:44,977
I mean, it took me four years
to figure out the bat trick.

319
00:19:45,079 --> 00:19:47,809
I tried to look her up
about a year or so ago...

320
00:19:47,915 --> 00:19:52,215
<i>but she dropped out after freshman year,
and the trail goes cold.</i>

321
00:19:53,854 --> 00:19:56,880
Tucker, I appreciate you
being here. L- I really do.

322
00:19:56,991 --> 00:19:59,892
But I think right now
I just need to be alone for a while.

323
00:19:59,994 --> 00:20:01,894
Okay, man.

324
00:20:01,996 --> 00:20:03,896
I'll check on you tomorrow.

325
00:20:03,998 --> 00:20:06,398
Besides, I got a date with the old lady.

326
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:09,060
Wait. You have a girlfriend?

327
00:20:09,169 --> 00:20:11,069
Well, I'm not the kind of guy...

328
00:20:11,171 --> 00:20:13,071
that gets chained down to one woman...

329
00:20:13,173 --> 00:20:15,471
but lately I've been banging Candace.

330
00:20:15,576 --> 00:20:17,476
That crazy handicapped chick?

331
00:20:17,578 --> 00:20:19,978
Hey. Epilepsy, dude. It's a condition.

332
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,140
Plus, it's kind of hot.
She, like, vibrates.

333
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:24,649
Nice.

334
00:20:26,421 --> 00:20:28,548
<i>[Tucker]
All right.</i>

335
00:20:28,655 --> 00:20:31,647
<i>Okay, looking good. Looking good.</i>

336
00:20:31,758 --> 00:20:34,454
Bobby, you wanna sit up
real straight for me there?

337
00:20:34,561 --> 00:20:36,995
<i>- Sit up straight, sweetie.
- All right.</i>

338
00:20:37,097 --> 00:20:40,589
Everybody say, "Fuzzy pickles. "

339
00:20:40,701 --> 00:20:42,896
[All]
Fuzzy pickles.

340
00:20:43,003 --> 00:20:44,903
That was great. That was great.

341
00:20:45,005 --> 00:20:50,500
I'm gonna try one more, and let me
work with Mommy for a second.

342
00:20:50,611 --> 00:20:52,272
All right, let's see.

343
00:20:52,379 --> 00:20:56,281
Let's brush some of this hair away
from Mommy's neck-

344
00:20:56,383 --> 00:20:58,283
Bring out Mommy's pretty neck.

345
00:20:58,385 --> 00:21:01,081
That's good. That's good. Okay.

346
00:21:01,188 --> 00:21:04,783
Let's have a couple wisps
hang down here by the nape of the neck.

347
00:21:04,892 --> 00:21:07,190
That's good. That looks great. There we go.

348
00:21:07,294 --> 00:21:11,856
And here, position three-quarters
there like that. Okay? Like that.

349
00:21:11,965 --> 00:21:13,933
That's good. That's good.

350
00:21:14,034 --> 00:21:16,696
- Like that, and- -
[Giggles] - Okay, okay.

351
00:21:16,803 --> 00:21:20,000
- Okay, that's enough playful, pal.
- It's gonna be good.

352
00:21:20,107 --> 00:21:22,507
All right, stay like that.

353
00:21:22,609 --> 00:21:26,511
It's gonna be good. Okay, now
everybody say, "Mommy's a vision. "

354
00:21:26,613 --> 00:21:29,377
[Mommy]
Mommy's a vision.

355
00:21:30,517 --> 00:21:33,418
<i>Do not run away.
Hey, this is big-time stuff.</i>

356
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,420
Mr. Biederman is extremely upset.

357
00:21:35,522 --> 00:21:39,151
He brings his family in for a photo
and you turn that into soft-core pornography.

358
00:21:39,259 --> 00:21:41,159
He's crazy. I think he does drugs.

359
00:21:41,261 --> 00:21:44,162
Well, he said that you unbuttoned
his wife's shirt.

360
00:21:44,264 --> 00:21:47,165
He said you handed her
your phone number as she was leaving.

361
00:21:47,267 --> 00:21:49,667
- What the "H", bro? Come on!
- Some mail came for you.

362
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:51,670
<i>Sweet. New playboy.</i>

363
00:21:51,772 --> 00:21:54,673
How many times have I told you not to
have that delivered here? About a million?

364
00:21:54,775 --> 00:21:57,676
Why doesn't anybody
listen to me, ever? Jesus! [Sighs]

365
00:21:57,778 --> 00:21:59,541
Oh, my God.

What?

367
00:22:01,582 --> 00:22:03,573
Pack your bags, Eugene. I found her.

368
00:22:03,684 --> 00:22:06,585
<i>- No, no, no. You cannot be here.
- Juanita, vamonos.</i>

369
00:22:06,687 --> 00:22:08,780
- I found Cindi.
- What? Where?

<i>Mierda.</i>

373
00:22:17,764 --> 00:22:19,994
I can't believe Cindi would do this.

374
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:22,500
She's changed, man. She's all growed up.

<i>The girl next door is now

<i>Oh, my God. It says one ofher likes
is sex on the beach.</i>

Calm down. That could just be the drink.

378
00:22:31,178 --> 00:22:34,341
Tucker, do you think
that Cindi's still a virgin?

379
00:22:34,448 --> 00:22:36,348
Let's see.

380
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:41,920
No, afraid not.

- Oh, my God.
- This is perfect.

So?

00:22:51,832 --> 00:22:54,733
So, this Saturday
all the Playmates, including Cindi...

386

are gonna be at the Playboy Mansion...

sipping slightly alcoholic beverages.

- Yeah, but, Tucker-
- Dude, this is meant to be.

come out right now...</i>

I guess.

392
00:23:09,883 --> 00:23:12,784
This is true love speaking. True love doesn't
speak often, but it's speaking to us now.

393
00:23:12,886 --> 00:23:15,411
It's telling us to go
to the Playboy Mansion.

394
00:23:15,522 --> 00:23:17,786
Yeah, but, Tucker,
I can't even walk here, man.

- You're getting a little better every day, right?
- Yeah.

396
00:23:20,927 --> 00:23:24,294
So the party's Saturday night. That means
we have to catch a plane Saturday morning.

397
00:23:24,398 --> 00:23:27,959
It's Thursday today, so that gives us
three days to get you on your feet.

No. I know. I mean, what? Why?

Because they put dogs
to sleep at the pound.

983

They were gonna put Puddles here down
'cause he was sick and nobody would adopt him.

So I took him home with me and I've
slowly been nursing him back to health.

No, that's really not necessary.

Tucker, the point I'm trying to make...

1188
01:17:45,560 --> 01:17:48,154
is that when you find
that special someone in your life...

1189
01:17:48,263 --> 01:17:50,197
you have to hold on to them.

<i>Now, I've known
quite a few women in my life...</i>

1192
01:17:57,038 --> 01:18:00,166
But I'd trade it all in
for just one more afternoon...

1193
01:18:00,275 --> 01:18:03,802
with this young 18-year-old girl
from Milford, Kentucky.

Who's busted.

1195
01:18:05,881 --> 01:18:09,339
Tucker, there's a bunny...

1196
01:18:09,451 --> 01:18:12,249
deep down inside each and every woman.

1197
01:18:13,855 --> 01:18:17,256
They're just not bunnies

1198
01:18:17,359 --> 01:18:19,259
No, they're not.

1199
01:18:19,361 --> 01:18:22,159
But if you can see
the bunny in those girls...

1200
01:18:22,264 --> 01:18:25,028
then you're on to something, my friend.

1201
01:18:26,701 --> 01:18:28,726

1203
01:18:33,909 --> 01:18:35,877
and that's why she had that seizure...

1204
01:18:35,977 --> 01:18:38,502
and I stabbed her in the face a bunch.

01:18:41,850 --> 01:18:45,445
then none of these firemen
would be trying to kill me.

1207
01:18:46,955 --> 01:18:50,015
I gotta be honest with you.
I'm gonna call Security.

1208
01:18:50,125 --> 01:18:52,355
Okay, Mr. Hefner. Thanks for the talk.

1209
01:18:52,460 --> 01:18:55,588
No problem, son.

1210
01:18:55,830 --> 01:18:58,492
Look, I've said what I have to say.

1211
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:00,898
There's nothing else to do.

1212
01:19:01,002 --> 01:19:04,631
Things will never be the same because I
am always gonna think...

1213
01:19:04,739 --> 01:19:08,368
about you with those guys.

1214
01:19:08,476 --> 01:19:11,934
I don't even know why I came here.

1215
01:19:12,047 --> 01:19:14,481
Closure, I think.

1216
01:19:14,583 --> 01:19:19,520
Eugene, everything I've done since
you fell down the stairs has been for you.

1217
01:19:19,621 --> 01:19:22,886
<i>Oh, yeah, right. Posing naked in playboy
is really helping me out a lot.</i>

1218
01:19:22,991 --> 01:19:24,891
Thanks for that.

1219
01:19:24,993 --> 01:19:27,359
Eugene, where do you think
the money came from?

1220
01:19:27,462 --> 01:19:30,056
- What money?
- The money for your hospital care.

1221
01:19:31,900 --> 01:19:34,368
Your dad didn't think
that you would ever wake up...

1222
01:19:34,469 --> 01:19:38,462
and he was gonna have you
moved to a class "D" hospice where they-

1223
01:19:38,573 --> 01:19:41,041
where they basically
just store you till you die.

1224
01:19:42,277 --> 01:19:44,507
I sent whatever money I could...

1225
01:19:44,613 --> 01:19:46,581
from part-time waitressing
during college...

1226
01:19:46,681 --> 01:19:48,706
but it never really amounted to much.

1227
01:19:48,817 --> 01:19:51,650
Then I started making
some real money modeling...

1228
01:19:51,753 --> 01:19:53,880
and had you moved
to a better treatment center.

1229
01:19:56,524 --> 01:19:59,425
Tucker never told you any of this?

1230
01:20:02,230 --> 01:20:05,666
No. He never did.

1231
01:20:07,135 --> 01:20:09,501
Okay. Hef s orders:
All stalkers out of the mansion.

1232
01:20:11,172 --> 01:20:14,039
Let me go!

1233
01:20:14,142 --> 01:20:16,042
Ow!

1234
01:20:16,144 --> 01:20:18,044
- Eugene!
- Tucker!

1235
01:20:18,146 --> 01:20:21,013
I met Hef. He talked to me.
I think I had a breakthrough.

1236
01:20:21,116 --> 01:20:24,415
- How could you, you son of a bitch?
- What are you talking about?

1237
01:20:24,519 --> 01:20:27,181
You fucking brought me all the way
out here to your stupid party...

1238
01:20:27,289 --> 01:20:29,382
<i>- when you knew Cindi never left me.!
- Eugene!</i>

1239
01:20:29,491 --> 01:20:31,891
Wait. She was at the hospital
the whole time?

1240
01:20:31,993 --> 01:20:35,429
Don't play dumb with me!
She was paying for my medical bills.

1241
01:20:35,530 --> 01:20:37,521
<i>How could you not know that?</i>

1242
01:20:37,632 --> 01:20:40,965
Mister's girlfriend not pay all this money
for you to use this as a porno room.

1243
01:20:44,306 --> 01:20:46,831
The mister's girlfriend is on the phone.
You want to talk to her?

1244
01:20:46,941 --> 01:20:48,465
Go away, Juanita.

1245
01:20:48,576 --> 01:20:50,703
What an angel that young
Cindi Whitehall is...

1246
01:20:50,812 --> 01:20:52,780
for paying all this man's medical bills.

1247
01:20:52,881 --> 01:20:56,408
- I've never seen more devotion in all my years of medicine.
- Go!

1248
01:20:56,518 --> 01:20:59,180
Juanita, I'm trying to do something.
Do you comprende?

1249
01:20:59,287 --> 01:21:00,811
No!

1250
01:21:00,922 --> 01:21:03,152
You let me think Cindi had abandoned me!

1251
01:21:03,258 --> 01:21:06,716
But wait a minute. If Cindi was paying
your hospital bills this whole time...

1252
01:21:06,828 --> 01:21:08,762
then she obviously still loves you.

1253
01:21:08,863 --> 01:21:09,921
- You should be excited.
- Tucker Cleigh!

1254
01:21:11,032 --> 01:21:13,125
Candace!

1255
01:21:13,234 --> 01:21:16,397
[Gasps]
And Candace's brother, Rick!

1256
01:21:16,504 --> 01:21:18,836
Put him down!

1257
01:21:21,843 --> 01:21:25,040
You are gonna die
for what you did to my sister.

1258
01:21:25,146 --> 01:21:27,944
- Yeah!
- Make it slow, Rick.

1259
01:21:28,049 --> 01:21:29,607
L-

1260
01:21:29,718 --> 01:21:33,449
There goes that
sissy-hitting motherfucker!

1261
01:21:33,555 --> 01:21:36,956
- Eugene. So we meet again, huh?
- Horsedick.

1262
01:21:37,058 --> 01:21:40,027
- Dot-MPEG! Dot-MPEG!
- Dot-MPEG.

1263
01:21:40,128 --> 01:21:43,757
I was just telling my friends here,
if I ever saw your pretty little face again...

1264
01:21:43,865 --> 01:21:46,095
I was gonna rip it off and fuck it.

1265
01:21:46,201 --> 01:21:48,692
- No.
- And I don't lie to my friends.

1266
01:21:48,803 --> 01:21:52,102
All right, men.
Let's do this fireman-style.

1267
01:21:52,207 --> 01:21:54,903
[Firemen]
Yeah!

1268
01:21:55,009 --> 01:21:57,534
[Gasps]

1269
01:21:57,645 --> 01:22:01,775
I shall now bathe my steel
in the blood of the offender.

1270
01:22:01,883 --> 01:22:04,716
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait!

1271
01:22:04,819 --> 01:22:09,017
Before you kill me,
let me just say one thing.

1272
01:22:09,124 --> 01:22:14,426
<i>Candace, I know you're mad, and you have
every right to do whatever you want to me.</i>

1273
01:22:14,529 --> 01:22:17,396
But I just wanted to say that I'm sorry.

1274
01:22:17,499 --> 01:22:20,366
<i>See, I was just hangin'out with Hef...</i>

1275
01:22:20,468 --> 01:22:22,993
and I realized something-

1276
01:22:23,104 --> 01:22:26,835
You're my busted girl from Kentucky.

1277
01:22:26,941 --> 01:22:30,570
We both hate the same music
and like getting wasted and stuff.

1278
01:22:30,678 --> 01:22:33,374
And you like me despite all my faults.

1279
01:22:33,481 --> 01:22:36,348
So the least I can do is look past yours.

1280
01:22:37,752 --> 01:22:42,086
- My faults?
- Yeah. Candace, your face is a wreck.

1281
01:22:42,190 --> 01:22:45,489
- You stabbed me!
- That's one of my faults.

1282
01:22:45,593 --> 01:22:48,153
And you have this really stupid
hatred of strobe lights.

1283
01:22:48,263 --> 01:22:52,563
When you have epilepsy,
strobe lights trigger seizures.

1284
01:22:52,667 --> 01:22:54,999
- See? That's stupid.
- [Grunts]

1285
01:22:55,103 --> 01:22:57,003
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

1286
01:22:57,105 --> 01:22:59,938
The point I'm trying to make
is that none of that matters.

1287
01:23:00,041 --> 01:23:02,407
<i>I like you anyway.</i>

1288
01:23:02,510 --> 01:23:05,445
Look, I always hoped
when I met someone like you...

1289
01:23:05,547 --> 01:23:08,948
I'd already have this crazy,
impressive sexual history.

1290
01:23:09,050 --> 01:23:11,712
But now I realize that
none of that's important...

1291
01:23:11,820 --> 01:23:13,378
<i>once you find someone that you truly love.</i>

1292
01:23:13,488 --> 01:23:15,388
And when I'm with you...

1293
01:23:15,490 --> 01:23:19,256
none of the other chicks that I've nailed
in the past matter anyway.

1294
01:23:19,360 --> 01:23:21,385
Candace...

1295
01:23:21,496 --> 01:23:25,455
you're the last person
that I ever want to bang.

1296
01:23:25,567 --> 01:23:28,593
And if your weird brain thing makes you
bite my junk while you're blowing me...

1297
01:23:28,703 --> 01:23:31,866
then so be it.

1298
01:23:31,973 --> 01:23:35,067
I'll never stab you again.

1299
01:23:41,950 --> 01:23:43,918
I love you, Tucker Cleigh.

1300
01:23:48,590 --> 01:23:50,717
<i>- Goddamn it!
- [Crowd Groaning]</i>

1301
01:23:50,825 --> 01:23:53,157
I need to talk to Cindi.

1302
01:23:53,261 --> 01:23:56,890
Well, that was real sweet.

1303
01:23:56,998 --> 01:24:00,729
How you gonna get out of this, Eugene?
You gonna tell me you love me?

1304
01:24:00,835 --> 01:24:03,804
Horsedick, you gotta let me go.
I need to talk to Cindi.

1305
01:24:03,905 --> 01:24:06,806
Why don't you write
a message for her on my dick...

1306
01:24:06,908 --> 01:24:09,502
and I will make sure she gets it.

1307
01:24:09,611 --> 01:24:13,638
[Laughing]

1308
01:24:13,748 --> 01:24:16,683
<i>You know what, phil?</i>

1309
01:24:16,784 --> 01:24:19,912
That kind of thing would have bothered me
before- that you had sex with Cindi-

1310
01:24:20,021 --> 01:24:23,787
but not now, 'cause I had
a relationship with her.

1311
01:24:23,892 --> 01:24:26,690
She's not just some trophy.
She's the total package.

1312
01:24:26,794 --> 01:24:28,955
And a guy like you, Horsedick-

1313
01:24:29,063 --> 01:24:31,497
You wouldn't even know
what to do with a girl like that.

1314
01:24:31,599 --> 01:24:34,124
- I'll say he wouldn't.
- Cindi.

1315
01:24:34,235 --> 01:24:37,864
Cindi! Wh-What's up, baby?
How you doin'?

1316
01:24:37,972 --> 01:24:40,372
Horsedick wouldn't know what to do
with a blow-up doll.

1317
01:24:40,475 --> 01:24:44,070
- What? What is she talkin' about?
- Nothin'!

1318
01:24:44,178 --> 01:24:46,146
Hey, let's go back up
to the mansion, y'all.

1319
01:24:46,247 --> 01:24:48,442
There's a D.J. He's supposed
to be cold-blooded. Come on.

1320
01:24:48,550 --> 01:24:50,950
Horsedick doesn't have a dick.

1321
01:24:51,052 --> 01:24:53,316
Bitch! You promised.

1322
01:24:53,421 --> 01:24:55,981
- What?
- Horsedick wasn't born with genitalia.

1323
01:24:56,090 --> 01:24:58,354
He has to pee through a straw.

1324

- Yeah, dog.

1328

What about all them girls?

1329
01:25:12,140 --> 01:25:15,906
You know what? I've never actually seen
Horsedick make it with a ho.

1330

Why you wanna see that?

1331

Never thought I'd say this-
Fuck that! Let me see your penis, dog.

It ain't my fault.

And what happened in the past is the past.

1340

What's important is right now. I wanna-
I wanna start over, if you'll have me.

<i>- I just think that-

Okay.

1343
01:26:05,693 --> 01:26:09,459
Okay. I just have a question. Why didn't
you call me when I woke up in the hospital?

1344
01:26:09,564 --> 01:26:13,591
I call the hospital every Monday.
When did you wake up?

1345
01:26:13,701 --> 01:26:15,999
On, uh, Wednesday.

1346
01:26:16,104 --> 01:26:20,131
- And you just immediately ran off?
- Yeah, I guess.

1347
01:26:20,241 --> 01:26:22,072
Tucker's idea.

01:26:22,176 --> 01:26:24,804
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

We've really gotta
get you some new friends.

No. This one's okay.

She's somethin' else, all right.

So you guys are like-You're good now?

Yeah. Candace thinks that we
should try to get pregnant.

You know, really try to work things out.

During my time in South Carolina...

1396
01:29:09,421 --> 01:29:12,618
I discovered a groundbreaking
and new experimental way...

1397
01:29:12,724 --> 01:29:15,693
of reinstating consciousness
to the comatose.

1398
01:29:15,794 --> 01:29:18,695
It has proven itself
to be quite effective.
