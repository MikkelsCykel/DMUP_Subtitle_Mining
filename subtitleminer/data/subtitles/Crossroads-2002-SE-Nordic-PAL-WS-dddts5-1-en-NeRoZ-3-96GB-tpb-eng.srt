2
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:19,840
-Hand me the flashlight.
- Here it is.

3
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,880
- Hand me the flashlight.
- Here it is.

4
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:25,600
- Kit, I've got the shovel.
- You do?

5
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,720
Lucy, get the box.

6
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:33,080
- What are you putting in?
- It's supposed to be a secret.

7
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,320
- My dad thinks I'm at your house.
- My mom thinks I'm at yours.

8
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:43,080
Let's dig deep.

9
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,880
So no one will find it.

10
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:52,720
- Dig it deeper!
- We don't wanna get caught.

11
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:55,200
I want some dirt.

12
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:02,480
When we were ten growing up
in Georgia, Mimi, Kit and I...

13
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:06,480
knew exactly what we wanted
out oflife.

14
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,160
- Lucy, get the box.
- This is fun.

15
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:14,080
So we put our dreams in a box,
and we buried it.

16
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,480
We have to keep it dry.

17
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:28,520
We made a pact to dig it up
at midnight...

18
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,640
the day of our
high school graduation.

19
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,920
Pack it down.

20
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,920
- Let's be best friends forever.
- We will.

21
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:43,040
Now, I don't even remember
what our wishes were--

22
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,040
except for one.

23
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:48,840
We wished that we'd be
best friends forever.

24
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:52,840
Well, that wish
didn 't come true.

25
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:14,280
I see you on the street
andyou walk on by

26
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,480
Baby

27
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:23,280
You make me wanna hang
my head down and cry

28
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:30,640
Ifyou gave me
halfthe chance, you'd see

29
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,720
My desire burning inside ofme

30
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,440
But you choose
to look the other way

31
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:45,680
I've had to work
much harder than this

32
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,880
For something I want
Don 't try to resist me

33
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:53,640
Open your heart to me, baby

34
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:57,640
I hold the lock
andyou hold the key--

35
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,840
- Lucille Wagner!
- Pop?

36
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,880
- Baby, we're gonna be late.
- I was just--

37
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,800
- Did you practice your speech?
- I almost have it.

38
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,600
Lucy, how's it gonna look if the
valedictorian messes up her speech?

39
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,320
Okay.

40
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,480
Don't wrinkle your robe.
Just ironed it forya.

41
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:19,200
Okay, big day! Come on!
See ya on deck! Let's go!

42
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,160
Toads do look like frogs.

43
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:25,080
It's just one's, you know,
in the water and one's not.

44
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,720
It doesn't--
It could happen to anybody.

45
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,320
Hey, Mimi!
I know you want me.

46
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,000
Ho!

47
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,200
I'm gonna look
drop-dead gorgeous.

48
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,880
You should see my dress.

49
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:45,000
- Hello! Watch where you're going!
- You ran into me, Kit.

50
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,280
What, you're too perfect
to bump into anybody?

51
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,400
- What?
- Perfect.

52
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:53,000
Sweet, proper...

53
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,120
nerdy and virginal.

54
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,640
- I'm not--
- You're a virgin.

55
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,960
I told y'all.

56
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,200
Just get us in the picture, okay?
Hold my purse.

57
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:07,760
No, don't push the button.
Wait till I get over there. Honey!

58
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:12,880
- Mama, what are you doing?
- One second. Stand up straight.

59
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
- I am. I will.
- Tuckyour tummy in.

60
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:18,280
- Smile.
- Mom, I'm smiling!

61
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,360
Bigger, darling.

62
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:24,360
- Lucy, your speech was wonderful.
- Thankyou.

63
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:27,000
I hope you're gonna continue
studying music in college.

64
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,000
Actually, Lucy wants
to become a doctor.

65
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,920
Voice classes would make
nice electives.

66
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,960
No time. We're looking at a double
major in biology and chemistry...

67
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:39,240
if she wants to get into
the best med school, huh?

68
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,080
Henry, I'll show you how
to start that truck for tonight.

69
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,120
All right.
See you later.

70
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:48,240
- Bye, Ms. J.
- Good luck, Henry.

71
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,720
I'm all he's got, you know?

72
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,720
Congratulations, Lucy.

73
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,640
Thank you. Thanks.

74
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:11,320
Here it is.
Honey, what's wrong?

75
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,240
I'm fine.

76
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:19,480
Pop, I worked really hard
to be the valedictorian.

77
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,640
Course you did.

78
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,640
Why didn't it feel
like anything?

79
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:29,120
What do you mean, you didn't
feel anything? It felt great!

80
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:33,440
Pop, I never went
to one football game.

81
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,640
You don't like football.

82
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:39,400
But you're supposed to go,
and it's supposed to be fun.

83
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,040
And like all the parties
at Hemmings Field and stuff...

84
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,800
I never went to any of'em.

85
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:50,680
I never stayed out late.
I never just hung out.

86
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:53,000
'Cause you had
a head on your shoulders.

87
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,120
You stayed home, and you studied.

88
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:58,920
There's just a lot of things
that I wanted to do that I didn't.

89
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:03,720
And I was up there getting
my diploma, and I was like...

90
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,720
"Is this it?'

91
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:09,720
Come on now. Didn't we both
work hard for this?

92
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,960
You're right.

93
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,720
I guess it's just the pressure
of graduation. You're right.

94
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,800
Girls, hi!

95
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,960
Lucy.

96
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,400
Mimi, not now. Okay?

97
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:46,240
- Are you comin' or not?
- Coming where?

98
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,200
It's graduation night!

99
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:52,000
Oh, God, Hemmings Field.
I totally forgot.

100
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,600
So, are you comin' or not?

101
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,280
I have plans.
I'm sorry.

102
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,080
Come on. You okay?

103
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,720
Do you want something?

104
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,520
Yeah. Are you coming
at midnight or what?

105
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,920
Excuse me?

106
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,280
Kit, we made a pact, remember?

107
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:25,480
Oh, you're not serious!

108
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,840
Well, look, you can
really go without me.

109
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:33,600
I have better things to do
than dig up some old box.

110
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:40,320
Standing here
looking at all the world

111
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,640
The guitar guy is such a hottie.

112
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,240
That's Ben Kimble.

113
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,640
I heard he just got out of jail.
Killed a guy.

114
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,840
I don't believe you.

115
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,040
Yeah! Everybody's talking about it.

116
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,800
Oh, too bad!

117
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,560
Well, if anyone could have him,
it'd be you.

118
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:12,040
But I'm off the market, remember?

119
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,960
Oh, please!
Dylan's at UCLA doing...

120
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,000
God knows what
with God knows who.

121
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,600
That's not true.

122
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,040
Right.

123
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,960
Whatever.

124
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,920
- Are you ready?
- Yeah, yeah, just two seconds.

125
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,600
Okay, hold on.

126
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:40,240
Henry, are you ready?

127
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,200
I'm ready.

128
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,640
That's okay. Go on.

129
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,720
Why are you stopping?

130
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,360
This isn't how I hoped it would be.

131
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,520
That's weird, 'cause this is
exactly how I hoped it would be...

132
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,000
or pretty accurate.

133
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:38,800
- Maybe ifwe get into bed.
- That's a good idea.

134
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,800
These are nice sheets.

135
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,960
- Can I hear the list again?
- Oh, Luce, come on.

136
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:53,400
Please, please.
Just one more time.

137
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,840
Thanks.

138
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,880
All right.

139
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,320
Reason number one.

140
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:10,240
We've been lab partners for three
years so we really trust each other.

141
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,320
- That's really important. Okay.
- Trust is very important.

142
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:16,000
Reason number two:. We are both 1 8
and have never done it.

143
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,440
Very important!

144
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,080
Reason number three:.

145
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,400
We both want to do it.

146
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,320
Reason number four--

147
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:31,200
Please, Lucy, come on. Please.

148
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:35,040
I'm, I'm begging you.
Please, let's just do it.

149
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,600
- Okay, yeah, we can do it.
- Yeah?

150
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,680
Okay, so let's--

151
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,920
- I'll go this way.
- Okay, I'm going this way.

152
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,840
Let's do this.

153
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,720
Please don't laugh.
You're killing this.

154
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,240
- Your first time should be special.
- Yeah, this is special!

155
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,120
Listen, do you want to spend
the rest ofyour life...

156
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,520
knowing that you did it for the
first time with your lab partner?

157
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:08,400
Yes, yes, I do.
And I'll tell you why.

158
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:11,560
Because you know what it's like
for a guy to go to college a virgin?

159
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,960
No, I'm telling you
they, they--

160
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:17,160
They're ostracized!
They treat them like lepers!

161
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,720
I'm sorry.

162
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,440
- What's up, Mimi? How's the fetus?
- Drop dead.

163
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,960
- Is it mine or what?
- I can't believe we went out.

164
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:31,160
- I'm trying to do the right thing.
- Yeah? What's the right thing?

165
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,640
Ignoring me
for the past five months?

166
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,080
Letting your friends call me a ho?
Spreading rumors?

167
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,760
I'm repeating what I heard,
that you let some guy...

168
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:42,720
do you in his car
over Christmas break.

169
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,240
Jerk.

170
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,560
It's ten paces
on the other side.

171
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,960
- What are you doing here?
- Where's Lucy?

172
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,680
She's not comin'.

173
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:05,360
- You have a flashlight? Good.
- Gimme back my flashlight!

174
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:19,040
Let's just get this
over with, okay?

175
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,760
God, I don't even remember
what we put in here.

176
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,680
Me either.

177
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:41,440
Here, hold this
for a second, Lucy.

178
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,920
My Bridal Barbie!

179
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,520
She was my wish.

180
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:01,160
- You're gettin' your wish.
- I know.

181
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,480
Lucy, I think this is yours.

182
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,800
- My locket.
- What did you wish for?

183
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,520
I wanted to find my mom.

184
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,160
Did you ever find her?

185
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:19,000
No, she lives in Arizona and my pop
doesn't think it's a good idea, so--

186
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:22,160
What did you wish for?

187
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,680
- A key chain?
- No, the world.

188
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,880
That I was gonna get out
of this crappy town...

189
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,120
go all the way to California...

190
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:37,520
put my feet
in the Pacific Ocean.

191
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:40,520
There's a wish that's not
coming true for a while.

192
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:44,440
- A lot you know, Kit.
- What's that supposed to mean?

193
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,560
Slide Records recording contest?

194
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:55,480
- So?
- So I'm going on Sunday.

195
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,440
You're going to California
to audition for a record company?

196
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:02,440
- Yeah.
- You're pregnant.

197
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:05,320
- So? I'll wear something slimming.
- And what?

198
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,560
You think you're gonna become
this big, fat, pregnant star?

199
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:11,240
- I have a pretty good voice.
- How are you gonna get there?

200
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:15,120
- I found a ride with this guy.
- What? No, that is crazy.

201
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,000
You can't go to Los Angeles
by yourselfwith some guy.

202
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:22,600
So? Then come with me. I'll sing
lead, and you can sing backups.

203
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,520
- It's not something we should do.
- It's stupid is what it is.

204
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:28,240
Okay, fine.
You know what?

205
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,760
You can just forget
all your past!

206
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,240
Oh, wow.

207
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:41,000
- Oh, my goodness. Look at us!
- Let me see.

208
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,840
- I was so chubby.
- Singing.

209
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:50,080
- I have to go meet my friends.
- Yeah, it's getting late.

210
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,200
Yeah.

211
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:58,160
Hey, you guys.

212
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:02,440
I'm leaving Sunday at 7:00 a.m.
ifyou all wanna come.

213
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:12,520
What do you mean you're not
coming home for the summer?

214
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:15,280
Dylan, listen to me,
you have to come home.

215
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:19,080
Because! I haven't seen you
since Christmas.

216
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,000
Don't you miss me?

217
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:24,840
- Excuse me.
- Dad, customer!

218
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:27,080
Dylan, we have to plan
the wedding.

219
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,800
All right.

220
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,040
I love you--
Dylan?

221
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,080
- Hey, darlin'.
- Hey, Pop.

222
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:47,560
Dr.Johnson called today.
Good news.

223
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,680
Got me a job at the hospital?

224
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,000
All those discounts I gave him
finally paid off.

225
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:54,280
- Cool.
- Yep.

226
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:57,160
Can I askyou a question?

227
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,800
It's about Mother.

228
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,920
- Has she ever tried to see me?
- No, she hasn't.

229
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,960
I was thinking,
maybe she's afraid to visit me.

230
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,520
Luce, you do not have
to feel any guilt...

231
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:15,240
about your mother leaving us.

232
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,000
This is not about us.

233
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,000
She was the one who walked out
on a three-year-old.

234
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:23,440
She's the one that should
feel guilty. All right?

235
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,600
All right.

236
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,600
Nobody brings four suitcases
on a road trip.

237
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:28,800
Look, Dylan asked me
to go see him in LA...

238
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,400
and I can't get there
looking like a skank.

239
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,880
You better hope it all fits.

240
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,880
It will, okay?

241
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:42,840
I'm not going to the audition.
You can drop me off in Arizona.

242
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,280
- Fine.
- Fine.

243
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:49,280
- Fine. Shotgun.
- Yeah, right. I'm sitting up front.

244
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,680
You must be Lucy.

245
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,080
Yeah.

246
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,960
So you're taking us to L.A.?

247
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,400
Yeah. I'll get your bag.

248
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,280
- You okay? Sorry.
- Yeah, I'm fine.

249
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:11,400
- Move it, Ben! Let's go!
- I'll get the door foryou.

250
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,360
Hey, who's the guy?

251
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:22,640
That's just Ben.
He's really cool.

252
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,200
Let's hit it.

253
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,720
Where's the bathroom?

254
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,360
Second door.
There's no soap.

255
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,120
What's the deal with Lucy?

256
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,600
- What, are you hot for her?
- No.

257
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:24,840
I wouldn't even try, Ben.
Seriously, she's not like us.

258
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,840
She's way out ofyour league.

259
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,720
Want a chip?

260
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,360
Get outta here.

261
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,840
What are you doin'?

262
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,520
- What's with this music?
- Well, I like it.

263
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,760
Can we listen to something else
for ten minutes?

264
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,440
No.

265
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,360
Come on, Ben, please?

266
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,000
Be a nice guy.

267
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,720
Okay, five minutes.
Just five minutes.

268
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,160
Thankyou.

269
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:08,080
I don't wanna be a fool

270
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,960
In this game fortwo

271
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:14,960
So I'm leavingyou behind

272
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:18,600
Bye, bye, bye
Don't make it tough

273
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:21,360
I've had enough

274
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,400
Bye, bye

275
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,920
Baby

276
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:32,600
- Ben!
- I can't listen to this.

277
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,800
- You said five minutes.
- Forget it.

278
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:37,480
Like this is any better.

279
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,320
- Why are we stopped?
- I'm tired.

280
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,920
Let someone else drive.

281
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:58,600
No, nobody drives
the cruiser but me.

282
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:01,680
- Okay, whatever.
- Where are we gonna sleep?

283
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:04,360
There's a field.
I got a tent and sleeping bags.

284
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,280
A field?

285
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,800
No, I don't sleep in a field.

286
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:14,280
I saw a sign for a Hilton
back there.

287
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,840
How much money do we have?

288
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:23,720
I can't believe
you only brought $40.

289
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:28,440
I have expenses. I had to have
my homecoming dress custom-made.

290
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,640
I was voted queen, you know.

291
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:33,240
Oh, my dream come true.

292
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,920
- Did anybody make a plan?
- What do you mean?

293
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:40,040
How far you'll drive each day?
Which towns you'll stop in?

294
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:42,600
How much gas money you'll need?

295
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,480
Okay.

296
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:49,960
We have $486, right?
Which means...

297
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:53,160
for food, gas--

298
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,320
Is it enough?

299
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,960
It's gonna be tight.

300
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,000
Oh, my gosh.

301
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:08,080
It's a love room.

302
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,920
Oh, man!

303
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,520
Look at the walls!

304
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,240
- I'm not sleeping here!
- This is what we can afford.

305
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:17,720
Is this run by the hour?
I'm not sleeping here.

306
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,040
- Where you gonna sleep?
- I don't know.

307
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:23,560
This place is disgusting.
I'll take this bed.

308
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,400
So how come
you're going to L.A.?

309
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,160
My uncle might have
a job for me there...

310
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:45,640
so I'm gonna check it out
and if I like it, I'll move there.

311
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:49,000
What about your band?
Don't you have a band?

312
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:52,360
No, I was just filling in the
other night. I don't have a band.

313
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:58,120
Mimi said that she didn't think
you'd come with us on the trip.

314
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,760
Neither did I.

315
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,320
You sorry you did?

316
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,600
Not so far.

317
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:15,280
Well, good night.

318
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,200
Good night.

319
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:39,240
Hey! It's freakin' cold!

320
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:42,160
- We're in here.
- I'm in here.

321
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,680
I just need
to brush my teeth.

322
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,800
- What are you doing?
- You're so touchy.

323
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,880
Mimi, how do you know Ben?

324
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:04,040
- Just from around.
- Gosh, don't you think he's cute?

325
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:08,040
- He's all right.
- I can't believe he was in jail.

326
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:10,920
- What?
- Yeah!

327
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,440
He like killed a guy.
What? That's what I heard.

328
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,880
Excuse me?
He killed somebody?

329
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,880
No, he did not kill anybody--
I don't think.

330
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:25,560
Okay, he had a car, he was
coming to L.A. Don't be upset.

331
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:29,480
I'm on a road trip with a killer and
you're telling me not to be upset?

332
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,600
- He'll hearyou.
- Oh, my God.

333
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,160
What's up?

334
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47,320
Do you know him at all?

335
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:50,880
He used to hang out with some
of the guys at the trailer park.

336
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:55,000
So he may have
killed someone, okay?

337
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:59,400
So what? He did his time.
He paid his debt to society.

338
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,920
Oh, my God.

339
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:09,960
Ready to go?

340
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,880
Yeah.

341
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:15,680
Hey, you wanna ride up front
with me today?

342
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:19,800
No, that's okay.
The backseat's fine. It's okay.

343
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:23,000
- I'll check us out, okay?
- Yeah.

344
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,280
- I'll be back.
- I'll come with ya.

345
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,400
No, it's okay, I'm fine.

346
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:44,000
- Will you please get me some chips?
- No, Mimi.

347
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:45,600
Open the door.

348
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:51,040
I'll get my own chips.

349
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,080
Y'all, wait for me!

350
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:06,880
So when he came home
last Christmas, he proposed.

351
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,040
He's comin' home as soon as
he's done with school next spring.

352
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:12,800
You're seriously
gonna marry that loser?

353
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,760
You don't even know him.

354
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,960
- What's wrong?
- Nothing. It just kicked, is all.

355
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,040
- Can I feel it?
- Ifyou want.

356
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,320
It kicked again.

357
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:29,000
- What about Kurt?
- What about Kurt?

358
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,480
- He's the father, isn't he?
- Yes, Kurt's the father.

359
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:36,120
But it wasn't working out,
so I dumped him.

360
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,920
You're gonna raise this baby
all by yourself?

361
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:42,640
I'm gonna go wait in the car
with Ben, all right?

362
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,760
That's so typical of her.

363
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:48,600
She's not thinkin' about her future.
How's she gonna get by with a baby?

364
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,160
Well, she brought this
upon herself.

365
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,920
What?

366
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:08,440
- Hello.
- Hi, Pop.

367
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:11,000
Sneaking away in
the middle of the night?

368
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:13,360
I'm very upset with you.
Dr.Johnson went...

369
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,640
to a great deal of trouble
to get you that job.

370
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:19,200
- I'm sorry, okay?
- Sorry?

371
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:22,600
You are coming back now! And
you will regard that as a command!

372
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,760
You're usually so levelheaded...

373
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:27,960
andyou pull a stunt like this,
I am so surprised atyou.

374
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:30,800
You worked so hard. Areyou
gonna start slacking offnow?

375
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,920
What are you writing there?

376
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,640
Stuff.

377
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,680
Are you mad at me or something?

378
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:01,200
Why would I be mad at you?
I don't even know you.

379
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:08,160
- No!
- Oh, no, it sounds bad.

380
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:11,000
Look at all that smoke.

381
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,520
What's wrong with it, Ben?

382
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,640
It's the head gasket, I think.

383
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:31,360
- Give me your shirt.
- Here.

384
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:35,320
Whoa! What are you doing?

385
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,640
Nobody touches this except
for specialists and myself.

386
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,480
Because it's an antique
and I don't want people to--

387
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,640
- It's your radiator.
- No, it's the head gasket.

388
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:50,160
No, your radiator's cracked.
What year it this? '73.

389
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:53,840
Oh, that's like 350,
plus labor.

390
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,600
Great! Great!

391
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:08,920
I'm hungry.

392
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,960
How long does it take
to get a tow truck?

393
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:15,840
- Ben's only been gone two hours.
- I'm so hungry.

394
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:19,480
Won't you stop saying that?
We heard you. You're hungry.

395
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,000
So what?

396
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:29,720
We don't have $350.
Even if he gets a tow truck...

397
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,880
we don't have enough money
to get the car fixed.

398
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:36,720
I'm gonna be stuck here in--
Where the hell am I? Where am I?

399
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,040
Louisiana.

400
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:41,480
Stuck in some
butt-hole town, Louisiana.

401
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:43,560
I am never gonna get to LA
to see Dylan.

402
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,720
He's gonna be so upset.

403
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,400
Whatever.

404
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,160
Excuse me?

405
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,200
Could you be more self-centered?

406
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:58,280
- You're just jealous.
- What?

407
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:02,640
I'm not blind. I know how girls
like you looked at me in school.

408
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:05,200
You would've given anything
to trade places with me.

409
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:07,160
Girls like me?

410
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:10,320
I can't help it if I'm popular,
so just lay off.

411
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,440
Girls like me?

412
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:17,680
I didn't make the rules, Mimi.
It's not my fault...

413
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,840
everyone thinks
you're a trailer-trash skeeze.

414
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,440
- Stop it!
- Don't touch me like that!

415
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,920
- Guys, don't!
- You're pregnant!

416
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:28,120
You're a redneck!

417
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:32,280
Girls! Mimi! Stop!

418
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:38,320
Stop it! Stop!
I'm so sick of the two ofyou...

419
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,520
bitching and fighting
every damn second of the day!

420
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:43,400
For once,
would you just shut up?

421
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:46,840
I don't know why the hell I asked
the two ofyou to come on this trip.

422
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,040
We don't belong together.

423
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:51,600
This was a mistake, okay?

424
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,120
I'm sorry, partner,
that's the best I can do.

425
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,480
It's a cracked radiator.

426
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:07,800
He said he'd get it ready
by tomorrow.

427
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,800
How will we get the money
to pay for it?

428
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,040
I have an idea.

429
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,120
I'm gonna call my father
and have him come get me.

430
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,120
You're leaving?

431
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,280
This trip's over.

432
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:23,000
Wait, I have an idea!

433
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:26,000
You know what?
I'm sick ofyour ideas, Mimi.

434
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,960
I should've known you'd make
a mess of this trip.

435
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:33,040
Fine, run home to your daddy,
but don't try and blame this on me.

436
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:46,480
Lucy, I haven't asked you
for anything in a really long time.

437
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:49,520
But I'm gonna askyou to stay.

438
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:53,520
Please hang up the damn phone
and just stay with us!

439
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,400
Come on, Lucy.

440
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,600
Hello?

441
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:04,520
I do.
I have a really good idea.

442
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:07,600
Yeah, it better be good.

443
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:26,600
Okay, I have something
to say.

444
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:31,240
I know we're not all getting along,
but tonight's important.

445
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,560
We really need the money.

446
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:37,880
So could we just be civil
and get through this? Okay?

447
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,520
Okay.

448
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:46,400
All right!
Y'all ready?

449
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,360
Yeah.

450
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:53,320
- That's cute.
- Thankyou.

451
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,320
Wait.

452
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,600
It's all the tips
we can get, right?

453
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,320
- Mm-hmm.
- So?

454
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,280
Ifwe wanna put on a show,
we have to be sexy.

455
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:10,160
Now you're talkin'.

456
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:16,480
- Whatcha got?
- Let me wear those feathers.

457
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:19,280
All right, next contestant's
a brand-new act.

458
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:22,400
And for all tourists that don't
know how the rules go in my club...

459
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,520
here it is, plain and simple.

460
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,560
You're the judge.
Ifyou hate 'em, tell 'em.

461
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,560
Ifyou like 'em, pay 'em.

462
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,920
We got baskets going around.
Put the money in there.

463
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,960
Be loud, be fair and be generous
ifyou like what you hear.

464
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:36,160
So, come on, give 'em
a warm welcome.

465
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,360
- They lookyoung.
- It's past their bedtime.

466
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:15,360
I saw him dancing there
by the record machine

467
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:18,920
Get off the stage!

468
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,480
- Mimi, come on!
- I can't do it.

469
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:30,080
- You can do it.
- I thought so, but I can't.

470
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:33,040
- Please do it for me.
- You just gotta go do it.

471
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:36,320
- No, you do it.
- I don't know if I can.

472
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:40,000
You've got the best voice.
Come on, please for me.

473
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:42,680
- Okay, okay.
- Thankyou.

474
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,800
- You okay?
- No.

475
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:08,600
I saw him dancing there
by the record machine

476
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,560
I knew he must have been
about 17

477
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,800
The beat was going strong

478
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:21,320
Playing my favorite song

479
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:27,080
I could tell it wouldn 't be long
till he was with me, yeah, me

480
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:32,320
I could tell it wouldn 't be long
till he was with me singing

481
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:37,240
I love rock and roll so put
another dime in the jukebox, baby

482
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:43,160
I love rock and roll so come
and take some time and dance with me

483
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:50,360
He smiled so I got up
and asked for his name

484
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:56,200
But that don 't matter
he said 'cause it's all the same

485
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:58,840
He said, can I take you home

486
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:03,440
Where we can be alone

487
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:06,280
And next we were movin ' on
and he was with me

488
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,280
Yeah, me

489
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:13,440
And next we were movin ' on and
he was with me, yeah, me, singing

490
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,880
I love rock and roll

491
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,080
'Cause it soothes my soul
Yeah

492
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,040
I love rock and roll

493
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:38,440
Yeah

494
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:53,160
And we were moving on
and singing that same old song

495
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:55,000
Yeah, me

496
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:20,560
Roll, roll, roll

497
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,560
Now.

498
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,280
It's so amazing.

499
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,800
Lucy, come here.

500
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:09,240
- How much is it?
- Enough for the car and the trip.

501
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,680
Perfect.

502
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:17,560
You wanna come dance with us?

503
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:21,360
No. We should get outta here before
somebody realizes you're underage.

504
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,840
Come on, just a
little bit longer, please?

505
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:27,000
- All right, you go ahead.
- Thankyou.

506
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:35,320
- Hey, she with you?
- What?

507
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:38,320
Is she your girl?

508
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,240
No.

509
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:43,320
Yeah. Watch this.

510
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,400
Move your hands, please.

511
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:02,880
We're gonna get a little freaky.
Hey, what's up, baby? Come on.

512
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,360
- What's wrong?
- Will you stop it?

513
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:08,600
Excuse me. Hey, I don't think
she wants to dance.

514
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:11,600
I think she does.
You should mind your own business.

515
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:14,400
- Will you leave me alone?
- Excuse me. I'm talking to you.

516
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,520
My nose!

517
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:23,800
Let's go.

518
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:31,120
Oh, damn!

519
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,600
Is this livin' or what?

520
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:35,080
There's a mini-bar!

521
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:40,600
Y'all, you could swim
in this bathtub!

522
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,440
Look, I'm--

523
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:47,240
I'm not mad at you
for what happened there. Okay?

524
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:49,080
There's bathrobes!

525
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,080
- Where are you going?
-Just going out.

526
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,280
Are any ofyou guys tired,
'cause it's 3:00 a.m. and I'm wired!

527
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:01,880
- Who wants some of mama's punch?
- Me, please.

528
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,760
- Madame.
- Madame.

529
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:26,400
Go, Lucy! Go, Lucy!

530
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:33,960
What are you doing?

531
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,080
You go, girl!

532
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,040
I have seen one, y'all.

533
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:49,720
Yeah, but have you touched one?

534
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:54,880
She has!
Give us the details!

535
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,360
It's always the quiet ones.

536
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:01,000
Say it loud. Say you
touched one and you're proud!

537
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:03,800
Lucy touched one!
She did!

538
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:16,280
Okay, the best thing
that ever happened to you.

539
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,400
- That's easy.
- What?

540
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:22,400
Reaching my goal weight.

541
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:25,880
Third year at fat camp,
the summer before eighth grade.

542
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,240
Wait, that camp you went to
every summer was a fat camp?

543
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:35,280
Yes, and I loved it.

544
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:37,440
For two months...

545
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:41,320
my mama wasn't around
to pick on me for being fat.

546
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:45,720
Being fat is just
unacceptable to her.

547
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:51,320
Okay. The worst thing
that ever happened to you.

548
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:53,840
That's even easier.
Reaching my goal weight.

549
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:55,600
- You said--
- It turns out...

550
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:59,040
that being prettier
than my mama...

551
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:01,560
is even more
unacceptable.

552
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,280
Oh,Jesus.

553
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,640
Yep.

554
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:11,680
One morning I woke up,
and she was gone.

555
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:14,640
Pop really wouldn't
say anything about it.

556
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:18,520
I thought she was coming back,
and Pop told me she wasn't.

557
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:22,120
They fought all the time.

558
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:25,440
You know, I think
that she just got fed up...

559
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:28,120
and took off
without even thinking.

560
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:32,000
And after a while, it was
just too late to come back.

561
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:36,200
I know she wants to see me.

562
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:40,880
She's just scared, that's all.

563
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:45,920
I'm gonna be so sick later.

564
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:49,120
Mimi, be glad you're pregnant
and you couldn't act stupid with us.

565
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:53,680
That's not why I don't drink.
I just don't see the point in it.

566
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,400
So you never partied?

567
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,720
Once.

568
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:03,320
Over Christmas.

569
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:07,920
There was one of those parties
at Hemmings Field.

570
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:12,080
And this guy
was drinking this beer...

571
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:16,800
and I remember
it was in a blue bottle.

572
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:20,680
And I was real mad
at Kurt because...

573
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:24,280
he blew me off again
to hang out with his friends.

574
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:28,400
So I had a few beers.

575
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:32,360
I had more than a few.

576
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:38,040
This guy, you know, he seemed--
He seemed real nice...

577
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:41,080
'cause when I couldn't walk,
he offered to drive me home.

578
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:48,760
It's no big deal, Luce.
It happens to girls all the time.

579
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:51,240
Did you go to the police?

580
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:53,400
No.

581
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:56,840
I'm from a trailer park.
I got drunk and got in his car.

582
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:59,840
So, Kurt's not the father?

583
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:03,640
I saw this ad in a magazine.

584
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:09,240
So I called up this lawyer in
Atlanta, and she sent me this stuff.

585
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:11,560
Um, all these pictures
and letters...

586
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:14,600
of all these people
who want babies.

587
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:17,040
- I was supposed to pick one.
- The guy...

588
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:21,440
what was his name?

589
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:25,440
I don't know.

590
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:31,240
Why did we stop being friends?

591
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:34,040
I don't know.
People drift apart.

592
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:37,720
Promise me we won't
drift apart again.

593
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:41,160
Come here.

594
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:45,560
And where have you been
all night?

595
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:54,680
Thankyou.

596
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:57,080
For what you did
last night, I mean.

597
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:59,240
Thanks.

598
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:04,480
Scoot over.

599
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:15,280
I'm never drinkin' again. Honest.

600
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:17,320
This burrito is so good.

601
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:19,520
Don't mention food.

602
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:24,320
- What are you doing?
- Chilling.

603
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:38,120
- Wake him up.
- Y'all, he's been driving all day.

604
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:42,120
- We can't just stay here.
- We should just let him sleep.

605
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:44,480
- Uh-uh.
- We'll let him sleep.

606
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:47,880
Lucy, get his keys.

607
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:50,800
He told us we couldn't drive
his car. I can't do that.

608
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:53,360
Why not? It's not like we're
gonna drive this over a cliff.

609
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:57,000
- It's stupid to stay here.
- I'll drive.

610
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:58,560
Get his keys.

611
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:01,440
- Yeah, get his keys.
- Why do I have to get his keys?

612
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:05,960
Because Kit and I voted
and you lost.

613
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:07,400
Get the keys.

614
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:10,000
Yeah, Lucy, get his keys.

615
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:21,520
- This is stealing.
- It's not stealing if he's in the car.

616
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:23,960
No, it's kidnapping.

617
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:32,800
Okay, stop.

618
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:38,520
Oh, I got it.

619
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:49,000
Go, go.

620
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:02,800
You failed driver's ed,
didn't you?

621
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:04,920
Maybe.

622
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:08,520
- Move over.
- Oh, God.

623
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:11,680
Guys, smile for the camera.

624
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:27,520
Go ahead, turn it on, turn it on.

625
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,800
Let's go, girls

626
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:46,680
I'm goin'out tonight
and I'm feeling all right

627
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:50,560
I'm gonna let
it all hang out

628
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:54,200
Wanna make some noise
Really raise my voice

629
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:57,960
Yeah, I'm gonna scream and shout

630
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:08,920
Get a little outta line

631
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:12,360
I ain 't gonna act
politically correct

632
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:16,560
I only wanna have a good time

633
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:20,520
The best thing about being a woman

634
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:24,640
Is the prerogative
to have a little fun and

635
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:29,080
Oh, oh, oh
Go totally crazy

636
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:33,120
- Hi! Did you have a good nap?
- Yeah.

637
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:35,200
Stop, stop the car.

638
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:38,120
Don't be mad. You looked so sweet
when you were sleeping.

639
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:41,480
- We just didn't wanna wake you.
- Stop the car.

640
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:43,960
- It's against the law to park here.
- It's my car.

641
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:46,560
- We're almost at an exit.
- Stop the damn car!

642
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:10,600
- Mimi, go talk to him.
- Uh-uh, you go talk to him.

643
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:13,400
- Nobody's gonna go talk to him.
- I know, he's mad.

644
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:16,920
And he has killed before.

645
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:20,280
Mimi, you said
he didn't kill anyone.

646
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:24,400
- I said I thought he didn't.
- Oh, my God.

647
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:31,400
- It's okay, I'll go.
- I'm sorry.

648
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:36,960
God!

649
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:39,720
Be careful, Lucy.

650
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:48,800
- We're sorry.
- I've been in a car full of chicks.

651
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:51,960
Do you have any idea what it's like
being surrounded by girls?

652
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:57,400
Being a girl yourself,
I know, stupid question.

653
00:49:57,480 --> 00:50:01,000
But I'm a guy, okay?
I'm a guy.Just a guy.

654
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:05,280
And I have been listening
to girl talk and watching you do...

655
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:07,680
your girl things for days.

656
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:10,440
I'm not complaining, 'cause,
let's face it, I'm outnumbered.

657
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:12,360
But that's my car.

658
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:15,280
It's my car, and it's just--

659
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:21,840
It's the one thing that hasn't
been taken over by chicks.

660
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:27,000
- Okay?
- Okay.

661
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:59,840
- Ben?
- Yeah?

662
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:02,040
Were you really in jail?

663
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:06,200
Yeah, I was.

664
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:08,440
- So you killed a guy?
- What?

665
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:11,600
Who said I killed a guy?

666
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:15,720
Everybody back home.

667
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:20,360
Oh, man.
No, I didn't kill a guy.

668
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:22,920
What did you do then?

669
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:28,320
I was in college, and I get
this call from my stepsister.

670
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:33,040
She wants me to come get her 'cause
my stepdad is beating her up.

671
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:35,160
My mom can't stop him, so...

672
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:38,720
I drive home in
the middle of the night...

673
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:42,160
and she throws her things out
the window and climbs out...

674
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:44,080
and then I drive her back
to school in Ohio with me.

675
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:47,520
- And you went to jail for that?
- That's the thing.

676
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:49,400
There's this law...

677
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:52,880
against driving a child that's
not a relative across state lines...

678
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,560
and my stepdad of course
pressed charges.

679
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:58,360
But, you know, it's okay.
I only got six months...

680
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:00,560
and I had to stay in Ohio
for a year's probation.

681
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:03,960
My sister got to go live
with her mom.

682
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:12,000
You all really thought
I killed a guy?

683
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:14,920
Yeah.

684
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:20,840
What were you thinking getting
into a car with a homicidal maniac?

685
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:40,560
- Why are we stopping?
- You'll see.

686
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:54,760
- Mimi, you okay?
- Oh, yeah, I'm fine.

687
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:00,920
Look.

688
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:07,480
It's like you have to whisper.

689
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:11,000
Hello!

690
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:23,480
Man. We gotta make time. The next
hotel is still an hour away.

691
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:27,200
Ben, do you have enough
sleeping bags for all of us?

692
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:29,240
You serious?

693
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:31,840
You really want to camp here?

694
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:33,200
Yeah.

695
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:37,240
It sounds like fun.

696
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:43,040
You gotta keep your thumb
on the outside like this.

697
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:46,680
Right. Now, the trick is...

698
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:50,080
you don't want to let him know
that you're gonna hit him.

699
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:53,600
Maybe like look away first.

700
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:57,760
And then, when he least expects it,
you throw your whole body into it.

701
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:04,160
What are you doing to her?

702
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:06,080
I'm teaching her how to fight
because every girl...

703
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:08,920
should know how
to throw a decent punch.

704
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,360
That was decent.

705
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:12,320
I'm gonna go to bed.

706
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:15,120
I'm gonna go to the ladies room.
Where is it again?

707
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:18,000
Third bush after the rock
over there.

708
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:20,360
- This one?
- That one, yeah.

709
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:27,120
What are you always
writing in there?

710
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:31,240
Poems, mostly.

711
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:33,760
Can I hear one?

712
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:38,680
Okay. One.
But you can't laugh.

713
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:46,320
"I used to think I had
the answers to everything...

714
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:48,760
but now I know that life
doesn't always go my way.

715
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:52,560
It feels like I'm caught in the
middle, and that's when I realize...

716
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:55,920
that I'm not a girl,
and not yet a woman.

717
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:59,640
All I need is time,
just a moment that's mine.

718
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:02,880
And while I'm in between,
I'm not a girl."

719
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:08,480
I liked it.

720
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:10,120
Really?

721
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:12,240
Yeah, really, I like it.

722
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:19,960
- What?
- You got ash on your face.

723
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:22,000
- Where?
- I'll get it.

724
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:23,920
There.

725
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:34,120
- What's wrong?
- What happened?

726
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:36,400
Something bit my ass.

727
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:39,360
- Let me see.
- It's a snake bite.

728
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:41,280
No, Mimi,
that's a mosquito bite.

729
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:45,120
Don't look!

730
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:48,480
- How could I not? It's nothing.
- But it could've been a snake.

731
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:51,200
All right! We are outta here
at the crack of dawn.

732
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:53,760
Nothing's biting my ass.

733
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:58,480
So we'll be in Tucson today?

734
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:01,320
- Around 4:00, I think.
- Are you nervous?

735
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:05,080
Should I call and tell her I'm
coming, or should I just show up?

736
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:08,080
- I should just show up, right?
- Surprise is always better.

737
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:11,200
She's gonna be
real happy to see you.

738
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:12,760
I hope so.

739
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:29,400
You'll call and tell me everything
about the audition, right?

740
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:33,560
-You could still come with us.
-We don't leave town until tomorrow.

741
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:35,680
I'll be fine, okay?

742
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:38,800
You know where we're staying
ifyou need us.

743
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:42,000
Bye.

744
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:47,760
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

745
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:49,960
I guess this is it.

746
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:54,560
I guess, yeah.

747
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:56,560
What?

748
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:05,040
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

749
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:17,960
Can I help you?

750
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:20,920
It's me, Mama-- Lucy.

751
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:24,800
Come in.

752
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:39,680
You have a really nice house.

753
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:41,960
Thankyou, Lucy.

754
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:57,440
Tucson seems like
a really nice city.

755
00:57:57,520 --> 00:57:59,280
It is.

756
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:03,920
Can I askyou
why you're here, Lucy?

757
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:07,280
I wanted to see you.

758
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:09,320
And why was that, Lucy?

759
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:12,760
Well, you're my mother.

760
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:24,280
Why do you keep
saying my name like that?

761
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:32,080
Hold on a moment.

762
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:41,600
Hello?

763
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:44,120
Sweetie, tell Joey's mommy I said
you could swim for another hour...

764
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:46,000
ifyou put on more sunscreen.

765
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:47,920
I don't want you to burn.

766
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:51,000
Daddy will pickyou up at 5:00.
I love you.

767
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:04,000
- I have brothers?
- Well, yes.

768
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:08,080
- How old are they?
- Ten and seven.

769
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:11,760
Do they know about me?

770
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:18,880
Lucy, I think we need
to have a talk.

771
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:26,600
Whoa
Wait, seven, eight.

772
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:28,560
Five, six--

773
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:45,960
Come on in. Here.

774
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:47,880
- What happened?
- What's wrong?

775
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,680
- Get some towels, please?
- I'm fine.

776
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:53,800
So, Luce, you got to see
your mom, right?

777
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:57,960
- Yeah, I saw her.
- And what happened?

778
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:17,720
Just thought you might want
some dry clothes.

779
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:19,640
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

780
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:24,320
I'm fine.

781
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:26,240
I'm okay.

782
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:31,840
I know.

783
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:35,520
Really, I'm okay.

784
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:49,760
What happened?

785
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:57,520
She said...

786
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:00,840
that she never wanted me.

787
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:10,600
She said that my father
made her have me...

788
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:15,000
and that I was
just a mistake.

789
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:36,040
I look like her, you know?

790
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:40,920
I have her eyes and her hands.

791
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,160
It's her loss, Luce.

792
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:46,480
It's weird though, you know?

793
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:50,000
I don't have a mother.

794
01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:51,760
Well, you have us.

795
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:53,520
Yeah.

796
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:12,880
Trying to call your dad?

797
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:15,960
I can't.
I will in a minute.

798
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:17,680
You got that poem
you read me?

799
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:20,720
- Yeah.
- Can I see it?

800
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:22,800
Yeah, sure.

801
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:25,880
It's right here.

802
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:30,880
What are you doing?

803
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:35,280
Stop worrying so much.
Come on. I made you something.

804
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:36,640
Okay.

805
01:02:41,240 --> 01:02:44,000
This is my surprise?

806
01:02:44,120 --> 01:02:46,120
Wouldn't it be sad if it was?

807
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:48,680
Like if I just totally sucked
at cheering people up.

808
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:54,000
I wrote some music
foryour poem.

809
01:02:56,440 --> 01:02:58,360
Will you play it for me?

810
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:00,280
Will you sing?

811
01:03:05,560 --> 01:03:08,320
Just use this part
as the chorus.

812
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:22,800
- Yeah.
- Like that?

813
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:45,760
Go my way
Like that?

814
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:51,760
It feels like I'm caught
in the middle

815
01:03:51,880 --> 01:03:53,680
A little low there.

816
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:58,120
That's when I realize

817
01:03:58,240 --> 01:04:01,520
I'm not a girl

818
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:07,040
And not yet a woman

819
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:13,680
All I need is time

820
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:16,960
A moment that is mine

821
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:21,120
While I'm in between

822
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:24,960
I'm not a girl

823
01:04:35,040 --> 01:04:36,840
Thank you.

824
01:04:38,440 --> 01:04:40,280
It's no trouble at all.

825
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:25,480
Hello, you have reached Pete
and Lucy. Please leave a message.

826
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:32,200
Hi, Pop. I'm just calling to say
that I'm fine, okay?

827
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:37,160
And you were right about Mama.
You were right.

828
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:42,560
I love you, okay?
I'm fine. Bye.

829
01:05:49,360 --> 01:05:53,000
I'm not the kind ofgirl
you take home

830
01:05:53,080 --> 01:05:57,640
Ifit makesyou happy

831
01:05:57,720 --> 01:06:01,760
It can't be that bad

832
01:06:01,840 --> 01:06:06,880
Ifit makesyou happy

833
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:10,760
Then why the hell
are you so sad

834
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:16,920
Ifit makesyou happy

835
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:21,600
It can 't be that bad

836
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:26,160
Ifit makesyou happy

837
01:06:26,280 --> 01:06:30,960
Then why the hell
are you so sad

838
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:11,000
It's too cold. It's freezing!

839
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:17,200
Don't even! Don't.

840
01:07:19,360 --> 01:07:22,480
- I can't believe we're here.
- I know.

841
01:07:25,040 --> 01:07:27,800
Ben, you know, there are
a lot of colleges here in L.A.

842
01:07:30,560 --> 01:07:33,160
Hey, what if I didn't go back?

843
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:36,960
I could go to school here.
I mean...

844
01:07:37,080 --> 01:07:41,280
why don't I do something
for me for once, you know?

845
01:07:41,360 --> 01:07:43,240
I wanna stay.

846
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:45,160
I'm gonna stay.

847
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:49,760
Good.

848
01:07:49,840 --> 01:07:52,960
Look how happy she is.

849
01:07:58,120 --> 01:08:02,760
Fill this out, turn it in over
there. The audition is in six days.

850
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:05,000
Wait. Where do we turn it in?

851
01:08:05,120 --> 01:08:07,960
You turn it in over there.

852
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:10,120
Fill this out--

853
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:13,040
- What about music?
- You know what?

854
01:08:13,120 --> 01:08:16,280
I'll get some flyers printed up.
I know a few guys in L.A.

855
01:08:16,360 --> 01:08:18,960
I'll try to put a band together,
and I'll see you at the hotel.

856
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:22,360
- Okay. Great.
- Hey, where you going?

857
01:08:32,680 --> 01:08:36,440
Baby? Hi, it's me!
Guess where I am.

858
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:38,400
L.A.!

859
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:42,640
Okay. All right.
Then I'll come to you.

860
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:46,640
All right.
Then how 'bout tonight?

861
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:52,200
Then how 'bout
tomorrow morning?

862
01:08:54,760 --> 01:08:57,720
Dylan, I'm in Los Angeles!

863
01:08:57,840 --> 01:09:00,360
I came to see you!

864
01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:04,200
Fine.

865
01:09:05,200 --> 01:09:07,160
What am I gonna say?
Fine.

866
01:09:09,240 --> 01:09:11,040
Me too.

867
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:22,200
He's really busy with finals
and all. Yeah.

868
01:09:22,280 --> 01:09:23,920
We're fine.

869
01:09:26,680 --> 01:09:28,760
So who wants to go sightseeing?

870
01:09:28,840 --> 01:09:31,560
- I do!
- Okay! All right. Lucy?

871
01:09:32,840 --> 01:09:34,600
I'm kinda tired.

872
01:09:36,320 --> 01:09:39,800
Yeah, I'm pretty beat.

873
01:09:39,880 --> 01:09:42,280
Well, I need you.
We can't drive your car, remember?

874
01:09:44,160 --> 01:09:45,840
Don't wreck it.

875
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:47,840
All right!

876
01:09:57,400 --> 01:09:59,440
Wait, we're on Melrose--

877
01:09:59,560 --> 01:10:02,560
I thought we were going
to see the Hollywood sign.

878
01:10:02,680 --> 01:10:06,320
- We will.
- But I think it's back that way.

879
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:09,560
I know. But we're gonna
make a stop first, okay?

880
01:10:10,840 --> 01:10:13,000
Kit, you can
see Dylan tomorrow.

881
01:10:15,080 --> 01:10:17,000
- Kit, come on. Let's go back.
- No.

882
01:10:17,080 --> 01:10:21,240
- Kit, let's go back. Please!
- No! I want to see him now.

883
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:37,360
Are you sure?

884
01:10:38,360 --> 01:10:40,200
Yeah.

885
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:22,600
Kit, I really should wait
in the car.

886
01:11:24,520 --> 01:11:27,320
- How do I look?
- You look really great.

887
01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:29,560
Don't you guys want
to be alone together?

888
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:34,960
I want you with me.
Come on.

889
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:47,120
- Surprise!
- Honey.

890
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:49,840
Hi! Oh, baby.

891
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:52,240
Kit-Kat, I thought we were
gonna make plans tomorrow.

892
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:55,920
Oh, I know. I just really wanted
to see you. This is my friend, Mimi.

893
01:11:58,680 --> 01:12:01,040
You two know each other?

894
01:12:01,160 --> 01:12:03,120
Yeah. From school.
Right, Mimi?

895
01:12:03,200 --> 01:12:06,240
- Right.
- Yeah.

896
01:12:08,520 --> 01:12:11,720
Oh. Well, aren't you gonna
invite us in?

897
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:15,400
Yeah, I would, Kitty-Kat, but I've
got this friend here, and he's--

898
01:12:15,480 --> 01:12:17,240
you know, he's really upset,
and we're supposed to, like...

899
01:12:17,360 --> 01:12:19,240
you know,
hang out or whatever.

900
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:22,720
Do you need money for the pizza?

901
01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:28,160
- Your friend sounds really upset.
- Wait, Kit, hold on.

902
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:33,000
- Oh, God.
- Who's she?

903
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:37,240
We're supposed to be
getting married.

904
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
We're supposed to be
getting married.

905
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:43,800
I was-- I was gonna tell you,
I just, you know...

906
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:46,120
didn't want to do it
over the phone.

907
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:47,560
Dylan, you gave me a ring.

908
01:12:47,640 --> 01:12:50,480
You proposed and gave me a ring!

909
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:52,200
Kit, I mean,
I'm sorry, you know?

910
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:01,960
Oh, my God.

911
01:13:09,280 --> 01:13:11,120
It was Dylan, wasn't it?

912
01:13:12,680 --> 01:13:15,080
It was you.
You were the guy at Christmas.

913
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:19,000
- Wasn't it? It was him, huh?
- What are you talking about?

914
01:13:19,120 --> 01:13:23,120
That night when you came over,
you had that rip in your shirt.

915
01:13:23,200 --> 01:13:26,840
- That was the night that he--
- Kit, what is your problem here?

916
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:31,320
- Kit, I have to go.
- No, Mimi, come back here.

917
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:35,000
I want him to admit it.
Admit it!

918
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:38,200
You're getting all worked up
over nothing, Kitty-Kat.

919
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:42,760
My name is not Kitty-Kat.
I am not your pet!

920
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:12,920
Hello?

921
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:31,360
- Excuse me, where's the phone?
- It's right over there.

922
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:41,320
Yeah, can I make
a collect call, please?

923
01:14:59,720 --> 01:15:02,240
They said I lost the baby.

924
01:15:03,160 --> 01:15:04,960
"Lost it."

925
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:09,160
Like it was my keys
or something.

926
01:15:11,400 --> 01:15:14,720
Isn't that the stupidest
damn thing you've ever heard?

927
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:20,880
I'd decided to keep her.

928
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:26,400
I was standing on the beach...

929
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:31,200
and my toes were
in the Pacific Ocean...

930
01:15:33,480 --> 01:15:35,320
and she kicked.

931
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:39,800
It was like this sign.

932
01:15:41,240 --> 01:15:43,200
Don't touch me, Luce.
I'm already crying.

933
01:15:43,320 --> 01:15:45,440
Okay.

934
01:15:47,560 --> 01:15:49,600
I would have made a good mom.

935
01:15:58,120 --> 01:16:00,360
Just what were you thinking,
running away...

936
01:16:00,440 --> 01:16:03,160
with a pregnant girl!

937
01:16:03,240 --> 01:16:05,080
Lucy, I'm waiting
for an answer.

938
01:16:05,160 --> 01:16:07,640
Do you know what it took
to come here?

939
01:16:07,720 --> 01:16:10,920
I had to take cash out of savings
for plane fare and hotel.

940
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:14,400
I worked hard to earn that money
for your college education.

941
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:15,800
I'm sorry.

942
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:24,960
So you made a mistake.
I understand.

943
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:30,480
Everybody makes mistakes.
You're forgiven.

944
01:16:30,600 --> 01:16:32,840
I'm gonna take you girls back
to where you belong...

945
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:35,560
and we'll forget about
this whole crazy thing, all right?

946
01:16:35,680 --> 01:16:37,480
Okay.

947
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:39,440
Who's that boy you were with?

948
01:16:39,560 --> 01:16:42,720
How old is he anyway? Is he the one
who put the crazy idea in your head?

949
01:16:46,040 --> 01:16:48,320
He just gave us a ride.

950
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:50,560
That's all.

951
01:16:56,320 --> 01:16:58,880
Hey, sorry it took me so long.
We got a band.

952
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:03,320
- What are you doing?
- Packing.

953
01:17:03,400 --> 01:17:07,800
My father says I have
to move to his hotel, so--

954
01:17:07,880 --> 01:17:11,600
Until the audition?
How are we gonna rehearse?

955
01:17:11,680 --> 01:17:13,840
I'm not going to the audition.

956
01:17:17,240 --> 01:17:21,720
Look, I have to
go back with him, okay?

957
01:17:24,920 --> 01:17:27,040
Ben, he's my father, okay?

958
01:17:27,160 --> 01:17:28,800
I just can't--

959
01:17:28,920 --> 01:17:33,560
And with everything happening
with Mimi, I just think I should go.

960
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:38,880
- No, I get it.
- Don't be like that.

961
01:17:39,960 --> 01:17:41,840
I get it. It's okay.

962
01:17:43,280 --> 01:17:44,720
It's fine.

963
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:25,120
Did you see
how fast he went down?

964
01:18:26,680 --> 01:18:31,240
It's 'cause you threw your body
into that punch, like I taught you.

965
01:18:34,720 --> 01:18:36,320
You did really good.

966
01:18:39,480 --> 01:18:40,920
Hey, come here.

967
01:18:42,360 --> 01:18:44,000
Thankyou.

968
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:52,400
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

969
01:18:52,520 --> 01:18:54,360
It's not your fault.

970
01:19:08,760 --> 01:19:10,280
Got it?

971
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:18,880
I can't believe
this trip is over.

972
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:22,000
I know. God, doesn't it feel like
we left home a million years ago?

973
01:19:22,080 --> 01:19:23,920
Yeah.

974
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:29,360
- Hey, y'all, thanks.
- For what?

975
01:19:29,440 --> 01:19:33,600
For coming on this trip with me.
Thankyou.

976
01:19:36,080 --> 01:19:38,280
Mimi and I were talking...

977
01:19:38,360 --> 01:19:39,480
and we were thinking--

978
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:42,120
That you need to stay
and go to the audition.

979
01:19:42,200 --> 01:19:44,600
Guys, I can't do that.

980
01:19:44,720 --> 01:19:46,600
- I can't.
- You've got to.

981
01:19:46,720 --> 01:19:49,400
Kit and I voted, and you lost,
so you've got to go.

982
01:19:54,440 --> 01:19:57,680
All right, baby,
ready to head home?

983
01:19:57,800 --> 01:20:01,080
- I'm coming.
- Ladies...

984
01:20:01,200 --> 01:20:02,680
let's roll.

985
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:07,760
Come on, let's go.

986
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:13,760
We tried.

987
01:20:16,240 --> 01:20:17,440
Here you go, buddy.

988
01:20:17,520 --> 01:20:19,840
- Thankyou, sir.
- I'll take that, sweetie.

989
01:20:28,360 --> 01:20:29,520
Good-bye, Lucy.

990
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:31,920
Good-bye.

991
01:21:03,080 --> 01:21:07,800
It's gonna feel good
to get back home, won't it?

992
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:09,400
Look, honey...

993
01:21:10,720 --> 01:21:13,320
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

994
01:21:13,400 --> 01:21:16,880
I wasn't angry at you.
I was angry at what you did.

995
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:18,920
- Okay?
- Okay.

996
01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:31,520
I don't want to be like her.

997
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:35,120
We'll just get back home, and
everything'll be back to normal.

998
01:21:35,240 --> 01:21:37,120
You just wait and see.

999
01:21:38,360 --> 01:21:40,720
Don't make me do
what she did.

1000
01:21:41,960 --> 01:21:46,920
Don't make me run.
Just let me go, okay?

1001
01:21:58,360 --> 01:22:00,760
What are you--

1002
01:22:00,880 --> 01:22:02,920
I used to think

1003
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:08,200
I had the answers
to everything

1004
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:15,240
But now I know

1005
01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:18,400
That life doesn't always

1006
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:21,960
Go my way

1007
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:23,480
Yeah

1008
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:28,800
Feels like I'm caught
in the middle

1009
01:22:29,840 --> 01:22:34,720
That's when I realize

1010
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:38,040
I'm not a girl

1011
01:22:41,120 --> 01:22:43,480
Not yet a woman

1012
01:22:46,960 --> 01:22:49,720
All I need is time

1013
01:22:49,800 --> 01:22:53,800
A moment that is mine

1014
01:22:53,920 --> 01:22:57,560
While I'm in between

1015
01:22:57,640 --> 01:23:00,160
I'm not a girl

1016
01:23:02,120 --> 01:23:06,160
There is no need
to protect me

1017
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:12,800
It's time that I

1018
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:16,200
Learned to face up to this

1019
01:23:16,320 --> 01:23:21,800
On my own

1020
01:23:21,920 --> 01:23:27,960
I've seen so much more
than you know now

1021
01:23:28,040 --> 01:23:32,800
So don 't tell me
to shut my eyes

1022
01:24:00,520 --> 01:24:05,520
But ifyou look at me closely

1023
01:24:05,640 --> 01:24:08,640
You will see it in my eyes

1024
01:24:08,720 --> 01:24:14,240
This girl will always find

1025
01:24:14,320 --> 01:24:19,480
Her way

1026
01:24:21,320 --> 01:24:25,760
I'm not a girl
Don 't tell me what to believe

1027
01:24:27,840 --> 01:24:31,800
I'm just trying to find
the woman in me, yeah

1028
01:25:01,560 --> 01:25:02,840
My baby!

1029
01:25:17,520 --> 01:25:21,680
This time, we didn 't make
any wishes for the future.

1030
01:25:21,800 --> 01:25:24,880
We said good-bye to our past.

1031
01:25:25,360 --> 01:25:29,120
Now, none of us has any idea
where life's gonna take us...

1032
01:25:29,240 --> 01:25:31,680
'cause what we have is now.

1033
01:25:31,760 --> 01:25:34,800
And right now,
we have each other.

1034
