<i>From whence comes
the purpose of a person's life?</i>

2
00:00:24,057 --> 00:00:25,718
<i>From whence comes
the purpose of a person's life?</i>

3
00:00:28,595 --> 00:00:32,087
<i>Come it by chance, a casting of the lot,</i>

4
00:00:32,465 --> 00:00:36,128
<i>or does a call of destiny
beckon to each of us?</i>

5
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:41,799
<i>Many have wondered
about my little Hadassah</i>

6
00:00:41,908 --> 00:00:44,001
<i>and why a simple Jewish orphan</i>

7
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:48,444
<i>was chosen to stand against
the annihilation of her people.</i>

8
00:00:49,949 --> 00:00:53,146
<i>And yet the mystery of the girl
most know as Esther</i>

9
00:00:53,253 --> 00:00:55,244
<i>begins not where one might think,</i>

10
00:00:55,955 --> 00:00:58,253
<i>but 500 years earlier</i>

11
00:00:58,591 --> 00:01:01,458
<i>with a single act of disobedience.</i>

12
00:01:09,469 --> 00:01:11,369
<i>King Saul of the Israelites</i>

13
00:01:11,471 --> 00:01:13,803
<i>had been sent by the Prophet Samuel</i>

14
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:18,241
<i>to wipe out
an ancient child-sacrificing enemy.</i>

15
00:01:19,112 --> 00:01:20,875
<i>So pervasive was their evil</i>

16
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:24,381
<i>that not even their oxen nor sheep
were to be spared,</i>

17
00:01:24,784 --> 00:01:28,914
<i>and above all, no survivors left breathing.</i>

18
00:01:44,137 --> 00:01:48,574
My lord, I give you Agag,
king of the Amalekites.

19
00:01:49,075 --> 00:01:51,407
We have also seized for you his livestock.

20
00:01:51,511 --> 00:01:52,910
Even his queen.

21
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:11,919
What dark portent bid me haste
to cross this land of ours?

22
00:02:12,031 --> 00:02:14,158
How would you accuse me now,
O Prophet?

23
00:02:14,267 --> 00:02:15,928
I carried out your lord's command.

24
00:02:16,035 --> 00:02:17,093
Then why do my ears

25
00:02:17,203 --> 00:02:21,071
ring with the lowing of oxen
and the bleating of sheep?

26
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:25,133
Your Majesty, the Amalekite queen,

27
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:26,977
she escaped.

28
00:02:28,448 --> 00:02:29,745
We have the king.

29
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:31,781
What is one woman?

30
00:02:31,951 --> 00:02:33,612
You fool,

31
00:02:34,687 --> 00:02:36,154
she is with child.

32
00:02:40,627 --> 00:02:44,188
<i>While the Prophet Samuel
put a swift end to King Agag,</i>

33
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:48,089
<i>Agag's queen,</i>

34
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:52,336
<i>fleeing with the seed of vengeance
growing within her,</i>

35
00:02:52,705 --> 00:02:55,173
<i>the Jews never found.</i>

36
00:03:40,653 --> 00:03:42,416
Uncle Mordecai!

37
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:45,548
Rebecca, what kind of housekeeper
do you think you are?

38
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:48,659
Serves you right
for bringing home your work.

39
00:03:48,761 --> 00:03:50,820
The caravan arrived this morning.

40
00:03:51,297 --> 00:03:53,731
Well, Susa is the capital of the new world.

41
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:55,528
Caravans arrive every day.

42
00:03:55,668 --> 00:03:57,226
Not from Jerusalem.

43
00:03:58,938 --> 00:04:00,462
Well, perhaps
you ought to go back and ask them

44
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:03,041
if they'll arrive the same time next year.

45
00:04:03,676 --> 00:04:05,906
Next year? You promised.

46
00:04:06,112 --> 00:04:07,875
- Rebecca!
Fight your own battles.

47
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:10,848
You don't pay me enough
to fight the battle for you.

48
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,953
- Good morning, Hadassah.
- And where have you been?

49
00:04:16,055 --> 00:04:18,580
I'm sorry, Grandmother,
the markets were really busy.

50
00:04:18,691 --> 00:04:20,090
There's a new caravan in from...

51
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:23,824
- Sore subject.
- Uncle Mordecai,

52
00:04:24,197 --> 00:04:27,689
does not your own heart
long to see our people restored to glory?

53
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,960
It does.

54
00:04:29,302 --> 00:04:33,329
Did not Cyrus the Great conquer Babylon
and free our people from captivity?

55
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,807
He did.

56
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:38,236
But do we embrace our freedom
and leave this pagan empire

57
00:04:38,344 --> 00:04:40,209
to embrace our destiny?

58
00:04:41,314 --> 00:04:43,248
- Of course not.
- MORDECAl: Lord,

59
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:45,075
I pray to you day and night

60
00:04:45,184 --> 00:04:46,913
to give me the patience of Job,

61
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,749
give me the wisdom of Solomon.

62
00:04:49,055 --> 00:04:50,784
And what do you give me?

63
00:04:51,257 --> 00:04:54,317
You give me the endless equivocations

64
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:57,427
of a beautiful, young woman.

65
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:24,790
Look.

66
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:30,627
Hadassah, always dreaming.

67
00:05:31,731 --> 00:05:32,959
Maybe...

68
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:36,558
Here, then, you be the princess.

69
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:46,641
<i>While many Jews had forgotten
the acts of centuries past,</i>

70
00:05:46,746 --> 00:05:49,909
<i>the descendants of Agag had not.</i>

71
00:05:50,983 --> 00:05:53,781
<i>For Agag's queen did indeed survive</i>

72
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,681
<i>and gave birth to a son.</i>

73
00:05:58,991 --> 00:06:01,221
<i>And she forged for him a mark,</i>

74
00:06:02,595 --> 00:06:06,361
<i>prophesying that one day
an Agagite would arrive,</i>

75
00:06:07,266 --> 00:06:09,359
<i>a descendant of Agag,</i>

76
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:12,404
<i>who would finally exact vengeance
upon the Jews.</i>

77
00:06:12,605 --> 00:06:15,301
Hadassah, read us a story!
Read us a story!

78
00:06:15,408 --> 00:06:17,103
A story? You want a story?

79
00:06:36,028 --> 00:06:38,396
Hadassah, help!
- Over here.

80
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:38,829
Hadassah, help!
- Over here.

81
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:52,438
Are you okay?

82
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:57,213
"And King Saul said to David,

83
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:00,077
"'You cannot go before this Goliath

84
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:01,880
"'for you are but a youth. '

85
00:07:01,988 --> 00:07:03,216
"David replied,

86
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:07,159
"'While keeping my father's sheep,
there came a lion and a bear.

87
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,750
"'And I slew them both.

88
00:07:08,861 --> 00:07:13,059
"'This Goliath shall be as one of them
for he defied the armies of the Lord. "'

89
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:16,699
As will Jesse Ben-Joseph,

90
00:07:16,803 --> 00:07:20,261
should he but take one step closer.

91
00:07:40,893 --> 00:07:42,360
With peace, Haman.

92
00:07:44,363 --> 00:07:47,355
- There's little but random news I bear.
- I judge that.

93
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:48,997
Rumor has it

94
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:52,998
Queen Vashti plans not to attend
the King's banquet this evening,

95
00:07:53,673 --> 00:07:55,231
in protest of the war.

96
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:57,774
Apparently the King has no idea.

97
00:07:58,711 --> 00:08:01,805
Some see random news.
Others, opportunities.

98
00:08:02,448 --> 00:08:05,679
Of course,
this is why you are a dispatch rider,

99
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:08,184
and I am a prince of the Fars.

100
00:08:08,888 --> 00:08:13,018
Tell me, Agagite, what do you do with
the extra darics you connive from me?

101
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:15,320
I have 10 sons, my lord,

102
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:18,856
and a wife that makes many demands.

103
00:08:22,034 --> 00:08:23,296
Ten sons?

104
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:27,139
You serve the great king well.

105
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:30,267
Come, come. Go you now.

106
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:34,371
Speak of me
as you lavish your wife and sons.

107
00:09:12,985 --> 00:09:15,249
<i>Happy birthday, Hadassah!</i>

108
00:09:16,455 --> 00:09:17,786
A stone ball?

109
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:24,957
Remember, Hadassah,
it is the glory of God

110
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:26,588
to conceal a matter,

111
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:28,826
the honor of kings to seek it out.

112
00:09:36,442 --> 00:09:38,205
It's from the Promised Land.

113
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:42,347
Your great-grandmother
brought it with her.

114
00:09:42,548 --> 00:09:45,210
And like you, its true treasure

115
00:09:45,384 --> 00:09:48,046
is etched within.

116
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:01,024
<i>Reconsider my proposition.</i>

117
00:10:01,133 --> 00:10:03,795
There is much need for leadership
in Jerusalem.

118
00:10:04,837 --> 00:10:06,065
More stew, my lord?

119
00:10:07,006 --> 00:10:08,906
I don't suppose that in your entire caravan

120
00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:11,340
you have a cook one half as good

121
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:13,073
as our Rebecca.

122
00:10:13,312 --> 00:10:15,906
Here you are but a poor palace scribe,

123
00:10:16,215 --> 00:10:18,615
one who passes as a Persian, at that.

124
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:23,050
Are you a Jew?
Or have you become a Gentile?

125
00:10:23,656 --> 00:10:25,123
We're a small people

126
00:10:25,524 --> 00:10:28,186
caught up in a vast and violent empire.

127
00:10:28,427 --> 00:10:29,792
We have capricious princes

128
00:10:29,895 --> 00:10:32,728
who could order our annihilation
with the flick of a finger.

129
00:10:32,832 --> 00:10:35,596
And your presence in the palace
might prevent it?

130
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:39,464
Probably not.

131
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:43,837
Look, tell me what I want to hear about.
Tell me about the Temple.

132
00:10:46,912 --> 00:10:51,406
What ecstasy to stand in the presence
of the Almighty!

133
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:55,920
Like the intimate embrace
of a husband and wife.

134
00:10:56,522 --> 00:11:01,482
It's so much deeper
than mere mortal love.

135
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:04,224
Oh, hello.

136
00:11:25,117 --> 00:11:28,951
<i>Now, it came to pass
in the days of King Xerxes,</i>

137
00:11:29,155 --> 00:11:32,716
<i>who ruled over the empire
of the Medes and Persians,</i>

138
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:35,190
<i>from Ethiopia to India,</i>

139
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:37,420
<i>that in the third year of his reign,</i>

140
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,589
<i>he decreed a season of feasting.</i>

141
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:42,565
<i>Rumors of war were in the wind, however,</i>

142
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:47,298
<i>and some thought this the King's way
of stalling off a much-debated decision</i>

143
00:11:47,406 --> 00:11:51,433
<i>to march on Greece
in retaliation for his father's death</i>

144
00:11:51,677 --> 00:11:53,269
<i>four years before.</i>

145
00:12:01,454 --> 00:12:03,547
Queen Vashti, Your Majesty.

146
00:12:11,363 --> 00:12:12,330
Enter.

147
00:12:18,137 --> 00:12:21,072
The night's festivities
hold not your interest, dear?

148
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:27,446
It is long since you summoned me here.

149
00:12:27,481 --> 00:12:28,580
It is long since you summoned me here.

150
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:34,150
- Your hands have not been idle.
- Not idle,

151
00:12:36,622 --> 00:12:37,987
not gifted either.

152
00:12:38,457 --> 00:12:40,584
MORDECAl: Later, Hadassah,
we'll discuss this later.

153
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:42,456
I have run out of laters.

154
00:12:43,062 --> 00:12:44,859
The caravan leaves tomorrow.

155
00:12:45,664 --> 00:12:48,064
Did not the priest even say
it would be good for me?

156
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:49,964
That he would look after me?

157
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:54,595
You have so much of your
mother and father in you, you know?

158
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:57,440
And perhaps
I'm just being a very selfish old man.

159
00:12:57,543 --> 00:13:01,274
Do you really want to go to Jerusalem?

160
00:13:03,482 --> 00:13:04,449
Truly.

161
00:13:07,386 --> 00:13:09,081
Then go with my blessing.

162
00:13:11,857 --> 00:13:12,881
Thank you.

163
00:13:14,026 --> 00:13:15,425
Rebecca!

164
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:21,194
Yes, well,
I will be late coming back tonight.

165
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,928
The feasting has been extended.

166
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:25,930
All Susa is invited.

167
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:27,600
All of Susa?

168
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:33,467
A drunken brawl is no place
for a young lady of purity.

169
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:36,206
Then why is a good Jew like you going?

170
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:39,450
All the scribes have to go!
There is war in the air!

171
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:11,072
The Queen indeed
holds her own feast in protest.

172
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:13,242
All is prepared as you have asked.

173
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:21,920
You do know why the princes have asked
you to extend the feast another night.

174
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:27,631
You are too late
if you seek me to deny them.

175
00:14:27,733 --> 00:14:29,064
Especially now.

176
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:33,160
Such clamoring to march upon Greece
and avenge my father's death.

177
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:36,164
How long have you dreamt
of molding Persia

178
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:38,806
into a pillar of learning and culture?

179
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:42,742
A flame to make even
the greatness of Greece but a shadow?

180
00:14:45,117 --> 00:14:46,607
You know as well as I,

181
00:14:47,486 --> 00:14:49,852
this is not something that is won in battle

182
00:14:49,955 --> 00:14:51,616
but in the hearts of men.

183
00:14:51,857 --> 00:14:53,950
You would have me do nothing, then?

184
00:14:55,861 --> 00:14:57,294
You're no warrior,

185
00:14:57,863 --> 00:14:59,125
no soldier.

186
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:06,996
I'd have you stay,

187
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:12,143
enhance your kingdom,

188
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,842
preserve your throne.

189
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:53,180
Looking for someone?

190
00:15:53,552 --> 00:15:55,315
I'm fine, thank you.

191
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:57,012
You can run back to Rebecca now.

192
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:58,555
Oh, I'm sure you're fine.

193
00:15:58,657 --> 00:16:00,352
Only tell me, Hadassah,

194
00:16:02,594 --> 00:16:04,027
or whoever you are,

195
00:16:04,563 --> 00:16:06,997
how do you intend to get into the palace?

196
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:10,425
You didn't come to take me back?

197
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:14,239
Come, or I shall call you
Hadassah the mouse.

198
00:16:19,912 --> 00:16:20,879
Wait!

199
00:16:23,015 --> 00:16:25,745
I appear to you by the gracious command

200
00:16:25,884 --> 00:16:27,749
of the great king of kings,

201
00:16:27,953 --> 00:16:32,014
the emperor of the world, Xerxes,
son of Darius.

202
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:57,607
Great king.

203
00:17:01,387 --> 00:17:02,354
We drink.

204
00:17:02,588 --> 00:17:06,024
We drink also to my guard,
the immortal 10,000,

205
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:09,652
but I fear I would soon have to send them
out to conquer new vineyards for me.

206
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:17,667
Then let us drink to Queen Vashti,
the most beautiful in the land.

207
00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:21,763
Bring forth Vashti!

208
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,171
Vashti!

209
00:17:24,643 --> 00:17:26,508
Bring forth Vashti!

210
00:17:28,013 --> 00:17:30,777
They are serious? They demand
Vashti be here before all?

211
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,316
Already rumors circulate

212
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:34,648
as to why the Queen holds her own feast

213
00:17:34,753 --> 00:17:36,243
instead of attending yours.

214
00:17:36,355 --> 00:17:37,982
They sound riotous, my lord.

215
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:40,081
They fear a divided kingdom.

216
00:17:40,692 --> 00:17:43,991
My lord,
you know the Queen's position on the war.

217
00:17:46,965 --> 00:17:48,159
Send for her.

218
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:54,672
They go to fetch the Queen.
She must be lovely,

219
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:56,932
reigning in a place such as this.

220
00:17:57,042 --> 00:17:59,602
None is more lovely than you, my queen.

221
00:18:03,449 --> 00:18:05,576
- My thanks, fair prince.
- Prince?

222
00:18:08,487 --> 00:18:11,513
Why is it for years you threatened
to join the caravans to Jerusalem,

223
00:18:11,623 --> 00:18:13,113
yet you never do?

224
00:18:13,325 --> 00:18:14,792
What holds you back?

225
00:18:16,562 --> 00:18:18,655
Perhaps the courage to face it alone.

226
00:18:20,866 --> 00:18:21,945
What if you had someone to join you?

227
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:23,025
What if you had someone to join you?

228
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:33,241
The herald returns!

229
00:18:33,412 --> 00:18:35,744
The Queen asks the King's forgiveness.

230
00:18:35,848 --> 00:18:37,645
She cannot leave her guests.

231
00:18:38,584 --> 00:18:40,609
<i>I'm queen, not a pawn,</i>

232
00:18:40,719 --> 00:18:43,347
and I will not lower my dignity

233
00:18:44,389 --> 00:18:46,016
or shame my reign

234
00:18:46,892 --> 00:18:49,884
by wearing the royal crown
before your drunk

235
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:52,821
and thinly veiled war council.

236
00:18:53,899 --> 00:18:55,696
What news of the Queen?

237
00:18:55,901 --> 00:18:57,493
Where is our queen?

238
00:18:58,370 --> 00:18:59,564
Queen Vashti!

239
00:18:59,771 --> 00:19:00,965
Queen Vashti!

240
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,908
Am I to be a mockery before my subjects?

241
00:19:04,009 --> 00:19:05,374
Or Greece as well?

242
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:08,245
- Continue, Cousin.
- Might not this

243
00:19:08,947 --> 00:19:10,471
deed of refusal

244
00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:12,277
travel abroad to all women,

245
00:19:12,384 --> 00:19:15,148
making their husbands
contemptible in their eyes?

246
00:19:15,354 --> 00:19:19,222
Will not it be said by all, "Xerxes
commanded his wife to come before him,

247
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:20,484
"but she came not"?

248
00:19:20,592 --> 00:19:23,356
Vashti's guilty not only of
disobedience to the crown

249
00:19:23,462 --> 00:19:25,828
but against the protocol of our fathers.

250
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,257
And tell me,

251
00:19:31,236 --> 00:19:33,261
what dictates the protocol?

252
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,539
A royal edict must be issued

253
00:19:37,142 --> 00:19:39,440
and written into the rolls of the land

254
00:19:39,611 --> 00:19:40,805
that Vashti...

255
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:46,243
That Vashti come no more before the King,

256
00:19:47,085 --> 00:19:50,748
but that her royal position
be given to a new queen,

257
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:53,882
more worthy

258
00:19:54,793 --> 00:19:55,885
than her.

259
00:19:58,764 --> 00:20:01,756
My lord,
what answer do I send the Queen?

260
00:20:02,501 --> 00:20:03,490
Vashti!

261
00:20:03,735 --> 00:20:06,033
Vashti!

262
00:20:19,184 --> 00:20:21,675
The land has no more queen!

263
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:37,899
I wish not to be queen here any longer.

264
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:41,933
Mordecai is giving me his blessing.

265
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:45,767
Let us leave tomorrow,

266
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:47,145
together.

267
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:45,532
<i>Thus the scribes were assembled,</i>

268
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:47,571
<i>and a decree sent forth.</i>

269
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:50,908
<i>The princes did indeed press upon Xerxes,</i>

270
00:21:51,009 --> 00:21:53,978
<i>the king, soon to depart for war,</i>

271
00:21:54,179 --> 00:21:56,409
<i>"Leave behind a queen</i>

272
00:21:56,915 --> 00:21:58,883
<i>"to keep the people unified. "</i>

273
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:06,783
<i>Every maiden was to be considered,</i>

274
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:10,727
<i>the choicest of whom
to be brought from across the empire</i>

275
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:12,319
<i>and into the palace.</i>

276
00:22:22,941 --> 00:22:24,932
<i>In accordance with the protocol,</i>

277
00:22:25,277 --> 00:22:28,212
<i>young men were also rounded up</i>

278
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:29,871
<i>to become eunuchs</i>

279
00:22:29,981 --> 00:22:32,142
<i>who would serve the queen's candidates</i>

280
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:34,275
<i>during their time of preparation.</i>

281
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:41,153
<i>There's no need for alarm.</i>

282
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:44,254
In all likelihood they will not come for you.

283
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:47,628
And not all that are taken will be chosen.

284
00:22:47,733 --> 00:22:50,327
Doubtless, the queen
has already been selected

285
00:22:50,669 --> 00:22:52,534
through bribery or chicanery.

286
00:22:52,838 --> 00:22:54,703
How do I keep our laws?

287
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:56,334
How do I pray?

288
00:22:57,242 --> 00:23:00,507
What excuse do I offer God
for not keeping his commandments?

289
00:23:00,912 --> 00:23:02,504
Oh, Hadassah.

290
00:23:03,348 --> 00:23:05,748
God sees the inward observance.

291
00:23:06,251 --> 00:23:08,344
The court is a dangerous place.

292
00:23:09,354 --> 00:23:11,049
I think it will be better

293
00:23:13,325 --> 00:23:15,418
if you forgot that you were a Jew.

294
00:23:16,828 --> 00:23:18,523
If this is a sin, then...

295
00:23:19,297 --> 00:23:21,060
Then let it be on my head.

296
00:23:21,533 --> 00:23:25,094
Promise me that you will do that
if you're taken. Promise me that!

297
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:27,132
If I am taken,

298
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:29,329
I will do as you say.

299
00:23:29,975 --> 00:23:33,206
I should give you a different name.
Hadassah is too Jewish.

300
00:23:36,815 --> 00:23:37,804
Esther.

301
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:40,976
Esther is a good Babylonian name.

302
00:23:41,153 --> 00:23:43,815
Yes. That's what we shall call you
from now on.

303
00:23:44,556 --> 00:23:46,217
Esther of Susa.

304
00:23:47,993 --> 00:23:49,085
Promise me.

305
00:23:49,828 --> 00:23:51,625
Promise me if you are taken.

306
00:23:53,298 --> 00:23:55,596
I said, "If I am taken. "

307
00:23:57,536 --> 00:23:58,662
Lf, if, if.

308
00:24:00,372 --> 00:24:01,464
But for now,

309
00:24:02,674 --> 00:24:05,507
you should look for me
in the streets of Jerusalem,

310
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:07,412
dancing

311
00:24:09,514 --> 00:24:11,880
like David before the glory of the Lord.

312
00:24:13,051 --> 00:24:15,144
- Hadassah!
- Who?

313
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:26,354
Uncle Mordecai!

314
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:48,685
MORDECAl: Is this the way
the King's orders are carried out?

315
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,611
Senseless brutality
in the middle of the night?

316
00:25:23,321 --> 00:25:25,255
Father, please show us favor

317
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:29,990
and turn these dungeons
into someplace wonderful.

318
00:25:36,167 --> 00:25:38,829
Is this the dungeon part
or the wonderful part?

319
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:06,364
Look!

320
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:09,723
Sarah, it matches your eyes.

321
00:26:10,035 --> 00:26:13,061
Have you ever found anything
so wonderful in your life?

322
00:26:15,173 --> 00:26:16,800
And Hannah,

323
00:26:17,375 --> 00:26:19,104
was it not made for you?

324
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:24,214
Am I never going to see my mother again?

325
00:26:25,016 --> 00:26:26,677
Only if you wish not to.

326
00:26:27,185 --> 00:26:29,915
Two, three days, and who knows?

327
00:26:30,221 --> 00:26:31,347
Home you go.

328
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:37,825
Do you think we're not beautiful enough
to be asked to stay, Hadassah?

329
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:41,858
Welcome to a brand-new life.

330
00:26:42,734 --> 00:26:45,828
The method of your arrival
was not of my choosing.

331
00:26:46,638 --> 00:26:50,074
I am Hagai, His Majesty's Royal Eunuch.

332
00:26:50,175 --> 00:26:52,939
I have been assigned
to oversee your preparation.

333
00:26:54,646 --> 00:26:56,113
All right, it's okay.

334
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:12,563
<i>Don't let them escape. Kill them all.</i>

335
00:27:19,104 --> 00:27:21,402
Which way to the quarter of the Jews?

336
00:28:40,585 --> 00:28:42,246
You have a very bad habit.

337
00:28:42,821 --> 00:28:44,948
The palace is no place for children.

338
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:46,819
You think of me as a child?

339
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:49,659
Well, you're wrong.

340
00:28:50,261 --> 00:28:52,058
I am much younger than that.

341
00:28:53,598 --> 00:28:55,088
How do they call you?

342
00:28:55,667 --> 00:28:57,658
- Esther.
- Curious name.

343
00:28:58,603 --> 00:29:00,264
From where do you come?

344
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,632
I am of the wind

345
00:29:04,676 --> 00:29:06,803
whose sound is heard, yet none can tell

346
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:09,175
from whence it comes or where it goes.

347
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:12,542
Well, we gather within the hour.

348
00:29:13,218 --> 00:29:15,277
Try not to blow away before then.

349
00:29:22,293 --> 00:29:24,227
Another 4,000 talents

350
00:29:24,329 --> 00:29:27,423
for metal, weapons, armor.

351
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:30,132
And we must not forget
the pay of the mercenaries.

352
00:29:30,235 --> 00:29:32,635
I know this is not a favored opinion,

353
00:29:32,971 --> 00:29:34,461
but if used for peaceful purposes,

354
00:29:34,572 --> 00:29:36,631
such amounts could serve many needs.

355
00:29:36,741 --> 00:29:39,073
Two different ways of life are involved.

356
00:29:39,177 --> 00:29:41,543
The Greeks have no king
and they want none.

357
00:29:41,646 --> 00:29:44,740
It is one thing to beat our chests
and parade our boldness

358
00:29:44,849 --> 00:29:47,340
pretending this is
still the empire of our fathers.

359
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:50,319
But you hear the costs
of an actual campaign!

360
00:29:51,222 --> 00:29:53,383
If we are not honest with ourselves,

361
00:29:53,825 --> 00:29:56,555
I fear we lose much more
than just our stature.

362
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:58,592
Then, let us sit back and do nothing?

363
00:29:58,696 --> 00:30:00,061
Let the Greeks conquer.

364
00:30:00,165 --> 00:30:02,395
Let them establish democracy.

365
00:30:04,035 --> 00:30:06,503
Would not the King be the first to suffer,

366
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:08,136
the first to die?

367
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:10,532
Or does the memory of his father's death

368
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:14,203
not stir as deep in his bones
as it does in ours?

369
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:18,373
I speak to you as one
not without empathy.

370
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:21,182
I, too, have stood in the battle

371
00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:23,216
and stared into the unknown.

372
00:30:23,788 --> 00:30:27,053
For the very sword that took my eye

373
00:30:27,926 --> 00:30:30,622
took from me my manhood as well.

374
00:30:31,396 --> 00:30:32,693
<i>But be at peace.</i>

375
00:30:32,797 --> 00:30:35,265
<i>This is no warfare that you embark upon.</i>

376
00:30:35,967 --> 00:30:39,334
<i>This is only the life
that a great dreamer could imagine,</i>

377
00:30:40,138 --> 00:30:41,867
<i>or at least it can be,</i>

378
00:30:42,073 --> 00:30:43,973
<i>if you so choose to embrace it.</i>

379
00:30:57,088 --> 00:30:59,989
Think not I heard your
whispered orchestrations that night?

380
00:31:00,091 --> 00:31:01,922
And how you drew even me
into your schemes?

381
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:05,257
In these troubled times
it is easy to name any man traitor.

382
00:31:05,964 --> 00:31:07,556
I even recall a certain campaign

383
00:31:07,665 --> 00:31:09,929
in lonia under King Darius,

384
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:12,059
where someone allowed
the defeated Greeks

385
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:13,831
to keep their own form of government,

386
00:31:13,938 --> 00:31:15,269
their democracy,

387
00:31:15,406 --> 00:31:17,966
instead of placing the protocol
of the empire in control.

388
00:31:18,076 --> 00:31:19,509
Favoring democracy.

389
00:31:19,777 --> 00:31:22,837
The very doctrine to which
all Persia is opposed.

390
00:31:23,848 --> 00:31:26,749
- I followed orders!
- Come. Come, come, come.

391
00:31:30,755 --> 00:31:33,189
We trouble ourselves with foolish things.

392
00:31:33,524 --> 00:31:36,015
The King asked me to speak. I did.

393
00:31:36,594 --> 00:31:38,892
I obeyed. As you obeyed.

394
00:31:41,699 --> 00:31:45,135
<i>With suspicion and mistrust
creeping into palace halls,</i>

395
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:47,227
<i>Haman the Agagite</i>

396
00:31:47,605 --> 00:31:50,199
<i>found the opportunity
he had been waiting for.</i>

397
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:54,575
<i>He began to strike out more openly</i>

398
00:31:54,679 --> 00:31:57,045
<i>at the Jews living in the outlying land,</i>

399
00:31:57,482 --> 00:32:01,111
<i>painting them
as the true Greek sympathizers,</i>

400
00:32:01,486 --> 00:32:06,014
<i>setting the stage
for his ultimate act of vengeance.</i>

401
00:32:52,236 --> 00:32:53,203
Look.

402
00:33:05,516 --> 00:33:07,074
I am curious

403
00:33:07,418 --> 00:33:10,114
to whether you frustrate me
out of sincerity

404
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:13,150
or to ensure
that you're never chosen queen.

405
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:17,651
You assume I actually care about
being chosen queen.

406
00:33:17,762 --> 00:33:19,024
I am serious.

407
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:20,592
Serious of what?

408
00:33:20,698 --> 00:33:22,256
Finding a real queen?

409
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:25,825
Is that why you subject us
to these beauty treatments,

410
00:33:25,937 --> 00:33:27,700
these classes?

411
00:33:27,905 --> 00:33:29,839
You do not like our fine instructors?

412
00:33:29,941 --> 00:33:32,034
They simply neglect to
teach us some things.

413
00:33:32,143 --> 00:33:34,043
- Such as?
- Well, seemingly

414
00:33:34,145 --> 00:33:36,545
anything to do with actually being queen:

415
00:33:36,647 --> 00:33:38,945
The thought well thought,
the word well spoken

416
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:40,813
and the deed well done.

417
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:44,320
As it is said in the great books.

418
00:33:44,422 --> 00:33:45,616
You read?

419
00:33:46,324 --> 00:33:47,518
Many tongues.

420
00:33:53,297 --> 00:33:55,993
Before I received your "invitation",

421
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:59,328
I was reading of
Gilgamesh the Babylonian.

422
00:34:28,299 --> 00:34:31,029
<i>And Utanapishtim
spoke to Gilgamesh, saying,</i>

423
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:34,404
"Gilgamesh, you look worn out
and exhausted.

424
00:34:34,505 --> 00:34:36,939
"What can I do
so that you can return to your land?

425
00:34:37,041 --> 00:34:39,407
"I will tell you a thing that is hidden.

426
00:34:39,877 --> 00:34:41,970
"There is a plant whose thorns

427
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,373
"will prick your hand like a rose.

428
00:34:45,149 --> 00:34:47,117
"If your hands reach this plant,

429
00:34:48,019 --> 00:34:50,385
"you will become a young man again. "

430
00:34:57,762 --> 00:35:00,595
<i>Gilgamesh in the original.</i>

431
00:35:01,032 --> 00:35:02,624
I read translation,

432
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,934
never the original.

433
00:35:07,505 --> 00:35:08,563
You read?

434
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:13,505
There are few pleasures left
to one such as I.

435
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:19,041
You offer us Hagai's position, my lord,

436
00:35:19,417 --> 00:35:21,977
if we grant you the privilege
of picking a queen?

437
00:35:22,086 --> 00:35:24,418
- Misgath of Persepolis.
- Misgath?

438
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:27,614
Of unusual beauty.

439
00:35:28,259 --> 00:35:29,556
But up here,

440
00:35:30,161 --> 00:35:32,823
- empty as a beggar's bowl.
- Consider her family.

441
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:34,727
Daughter of a rug merchant?

442
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:37,328
Will they not
also shower you with wealth?

443
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:46,773
<i>While there were
certainly worse ways</i>

444
00:35:46,878 --> 00:35:48,937
<i>for the candidates to have spent their days</i>

445
00:35:49,046 --> 00:35:51,378
<i>than myrrh baths and beauty treatments,</i>

446
00:35:51,549 --> 00:35:54,643
<i>none of the rumors of riches and glory
stirred more excitement</i>

447
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:58,518
<i>than the thought of gaining entry
to the royal treasury itself.</i>

448
00:35:58,856 --> 00:36:01,882
Whatever you chose
for your one night with the King

449
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:04,427
will be yours for the keeping.

450
00:36:04,862 --> 00:36:08,389
Candidates, choose wisely.

451
00:36:24,715 --> 00:36:26,444
You stand not impressed?

452
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:28,709
It matters not what impresses me.

453
00:36:28,819 --> 00:36:30,534
How is one to choose when
they know not what impresses the King?

454
00:36:30,569 --> 00:36:32,250
How is one to choose when
they know not what impresses the King?

455
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:33,721
Will you teach me?

456
00:36:35,426 --> 00:36:38,190
I will do far more than that. Come.

457
00:36:44,502 --> 00:36:46,333
A recent acquisition.

458
00:36:46,437 --> 00:36:49,099
One, I believe,
the King will find most pleasing.

459
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:27,669
Esther of Susa,

460
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:30,881
<i>come:</i>

461
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:39,252
Seat yourself on the stool

462
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:40,889
and read the scroll.

463
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:43,051
It is the chronicles of the King,

464
00:37:43,294 --> 00:37:44,727
the royal diary.

465
00:37:45,529 --> 00:37:48,692
Through these doors
you are no longer a candidate.

466
00:37:49,233 --> 00:37:50,723
You are a servant.

467
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:53,361
Remember the protocol.

468
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:56,297
To approach uninvited

469
00:37:56,874 --> 00:37:57,898
is death.

470
00:38:00,378 --> 00:38:01,811
I read for the King,

471
00:38:02,813 --> 00:38:03,780
alone?

472
00:38:04,649 --> 00:38:05,946
Like this?

473
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:59,795
"Daily entry 23.

474
00:38:59,904 --> 00:39:02,464
"Egyptian wheat reserves were reported

475
00:39:02,573 --> 00:39:07,567
"at half the normal levels
due to a recent drought. "

476
00:39:17,221 --> 00:39:20,190
"Admiral Xtes was honored

477
00:39:20,291 --> 00:39:23,226
"for serving twenty years
in the Royal Fleet.

478
00:39:23,327 --> 00:39:27,388
"After a lengthy speech,
he promptly keeled over and died. "

479
00:39:34,305 --> 00:39:38,469
"Twenty-five. Three herd of sheep
were stolen from Dirmalmirah,

480
00:39:38,576 --> 00:39:40,635
"Satrap of Midea.

481
00:39:41,245 --> 00:39:44,703
"He requests that the crown send out
the proper authority. "

482
00:39:47,485 --> 00:39:50,454
And so Jacob,

483
00:39:51,622 --> 00:39:55,080
also a shepherd by trade,

484
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:58,817
was sent off into the far, far-off land

485
00:40:02,266 --> 00:40:05,599
where he came across the fair Rachel
tending her father's sheep.

486
00:40:05,703 --> 00:40:07,830
He was smitten,
and went and rolled the stone

487
00:40:07,938 --> 00:40:11,135
from the well,
and watered her flock for her.

488
00:40:11,642 --> 00:40:13,667
Then Jacob kissed Rachel

489
00:40:13,778 --> 00:40:16,474
and lifted up his voice and wept with joy.

490
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:19,549
When Laban, Rachel's father, heard of this,

491
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:24,246
he said to Jacob,
"Should you serve me for nothing?

492
00:40:24,355 --> 00:40:26,585
"Tell me, what shall your wages be?"

493
00:40:26,857 --> 00:40:30,918
Jacob said, "I will serve you seven years
for your daughter Rachel. "

494
00:40:31,028 --> 00:40:35,055
So Jacob served seven years
tending Laban's sheep.

495
00:40:35,166 --> 00:40:40,126
And they only seemed but a few days,
for the love he had for her.

496
00:40:40,738 --> 00:40:41,898
Then Jacob said to Laban,

497
00:40:42,006 --> 00:40:45,498
"Give me my wife,
for my days are fulfilled. "

498
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:50,376
So Laban threw a great wedding feast,
but in the dark of the evening

499
00:40:50,481 --> 00:40:53,109
Laban brought
his older daughter in to Jacob.

500
00:40:53,851 --> 00:40:57,787
And, behold, in the morning
it was Leah, not Rachel.

501
00:40:58,856 --> 00:41:02,314
Jacob was shocked. He said to Laban,

502
00:41:02,726 --> 00:41:06,218
"What is this thou hast done unto me?

503
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:08,855
"Did I not serve with thee for Rachel?

504
00:41:11,001 --> 00:41:13,731
"Why, then, have you beguiled me?"

505
00:41:13,838 --> 00:41:17,296
Why, then, have you beguiled me?

506
00:41:22,179 --> 00:41:25,080
I must admit that never before
has such a tale been found

507
00:41:25,182 --> 00:41:27,082
in the pages of a royal diary.

508
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:31,113
Here I expect to be lulled to sleep
by tedious reports,

509
00:41:31,222 --> 00:41:34,680
instead I'm beguiled by a love story.

510
00:41:35,025 --> 00:41:39,928
And how ends your tale?
This Jacob, he's able to have his bride?

511
00:41:44,401 --> 00:41:46,733
He's able to have her?

512
00:41:51,709 --> 00:41:53,472
Only after serving

513
00:41:55,546 --> 00:41:57,878
seven more years for her, my lord King.

514
00:41:57,982 --> 00:42:01,440
Believeth you in such?

515
00:42:01,785 --> 00:42:03,548
Love?

516
00:42:03,654 --> 00:42:07,112
Is it not the greatest commandment?

517
00:42:07,458 --> 00:42:10,052
No matter what God one serves.

518
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,890
- How do they call you?
- Esther of Susa.

519
00:42:12,997 --> 00:42:15,192
Susa? No.

520
00:42:15,299 --> 00:42:17,767
Nothing good ever comes out of Susa.

521
00:42:19,103 --> 00:42:20,468
Look at me.

522
00:42:26,076 --> 00:42:29,534
Come. Come, if you wish to see what I do.

523
00:42:43,627 --> 00:42:47,085
The Greeks, they have a god
of similar form.

524
00:42:48,198 --> 00:42:51,656
His arms will hold the bow,
whose arrows they say are

525
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:55,031
tipped with love.

526
00:42:57,207 --> 00:42:58,803
Some archers' arrows are tipped
with poison, my lord.

527
00:42:58,838 --> 00:43:00,399
Some archers' arrows are tipped
with poison, my lord.

528
00:43:00,511 --> 00:43:01,842
Sometimes

529
00:43:03,881 --> 00:43:07,874
it's hard to tell the difference.
The symptoms are the same.

530
00:43:11,322 --> 00:43:13,916
Perhaps in another time. Some

531
00:43:15,225 --> 00:43:16,192
other place.

532
00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:22,595
You will read to me again.

533
00:43:30,307 --> 00:43:32,571
You must tell no one of this night.

534
00:45:37,101 --> 00:45:40,400
My Captain.
- Blame me not for this, my lord,

535
00:45:40,504 --> 00:45:43,371
but the princes have ordered us
to begin bringing you candidates

536
00:45:43,474 --> 00:45:46,102
- by the end of the week.
- You jest.

537
00:45:47,144 --> 00:45:51,672
- I am in the middle of...
- At least you'll get it over with.

538
00:45:51,782 --> 00:45:55,240
Besides, these men might enjoy
seeing some ladies around. No?

539
00:46:08,265 --> 00:46:10,893
They tell me you're called Esther now.

540
00:46:15,038 --> 00:46:16,505
Oh, Jesse.

541
00:46:18,375 --> 00:46:19,672
Hatach.

542
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:25,971
Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego
were pagan names, too.

543
00:46:26,683 --> 00:46:28,275
We're in good company.

544
00:46:30,254 --> 00:46:32,950
Their names were Hananiah, Mishael
and Azariah.

545
00:46:33,724 --> 00:46:35,919
They were thrown into the furnace.

546
00:46:36,093 --> 00:46:38,721
But then what happened?

547
00:46:40,264 --> 00:46:43,233
Come on, I found a way out.

548
00:46:43,333 --> 00:46:46,234
And there's a caravan
leaving for Jerusalem tonight.

549
00:46:46,336 --> 00:46:49,032
So we can get out of this place.

550
00:46:49,306 --> 00:46:50,739
Escape?

551
00:46:52,943 --> 00:46:56,401
Jesse, I... I can't leave.

552
00:46:58,148 --> 00:46:59,410
What if...

553
00:47:01,151 --> 00:47:04,609
- What if I'm chosen?
- What if you're chosen what?

554
00:47:06,290 --> 00:47:09,748
What if you're chosen queen?
Look what they've done to us.

555
00:47:11,361 --> 00:47:13,454
What good could come out of any of this?

556
00:47:16,099 --> 00:47:19,557
Perhaps, instead of
asking questions of our trials...

557
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:23,799
Trials are meant to ask questions
of ourselves.

558
00:47:23,907 --> 00:47:25,397
They cut me!

559
00:47:28,011 --> 00:47:29,308
I know

560
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:31,841
we can't be what I hoped,

561
00:47:31,949 --> 00:47:34,417
- but...
- Jesse.

562
00:47:36,186 --> 00:47:39,553
I can't leave. I'm sorry.

563
00:47:42,392 --> 00:47:44,690
I'm sorry.

564
00:47:52,469 --> 00:47:54,562
<i>Today it begins.</i>

565
00:47:54,671 --> 00:47:58,004
<i>Each of you will be given
one night with the King.</i>

566
00:47:58,108 --> 00:48:01,703
<i>We gather first to honor
Misgath of Persepolis.</i>

567
00:48:01,812 --> 00:48:05,077
<i>You enter as a peasant
and leave a princess.</i>

568
00:48:12,823 --> 00:48:13,790
Here we go.

569
00:48:16,994 --> 00:48:18,484
Steady her.

570
00:48:23,667 --> 00:48:26,033
I'm so sorry...

571
00:48:26,303 --> 00:48:28,430
- Oh!
- Almost there.

572
00:48:33,310 --> 00:48:35,301
By the looks of it,
I must be allowing the candidates

573
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:37,403
to keep their jewelry.

574
00:48:38,215 --> 00:48:41,673
Perhaps a horseback ride
is not the best idea, my lord.

575
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:56,228
You weep not for the candidates
this evening.

576
00:48:58,268 --> 00:49:01,795
- My throat is sore.
- Your throat or your heart?

577
00:49:03,206 --> 00:49:06,664
It has only been a few days
since you read for him.

578
00:49:09,346 --> 00:49:12,247
A few days is a thousand years.

579
00:49:13,116 --> 00:49:18,053
If Xerxes had found pleasure in me,
surely he would've...

580
00:49:19,823 --> 00:49:22,485
You think a eunuch cannot know love?

581
00:49:22,592 --> 00:49:25,618
Back before I was a cripple of a man,

582
00:49:25,729 --> 00:49:27,663
there was one that held my heart.

583
00:49:30,233 --> 00:49:31,666
What became of her?

584
00:49:34,604 --> 00:49:36,697
I know not.

585
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:40,498
I never found the courage to return
to face her again.

586
00:49:45,282 --> 00:49:48,740
She is beautiful but delicate,
Your Majesty.

587
00:49:50,721 --> 00:49:52,951
Just one more moment, please.

588
00:50:05,068 --> 00:50:07,036
You may approach.

589
00:50:13,143 --> 00:50:15,634
How do they call you?

590
00:50:43,974 --> 00:50:46,340
Esther.

591
00:50:47,411 --> 00:50:49,936
This is your day.

592
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:52,947
<i>We gather to honor Esther of Susa.</i>

593
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:56,508
<i>You enter as a peasant
and leave a princess.</i>

594
00:51:04,161 --> 00:51:06,095
You can let go of my arm now.

595
00:51:09,099 --> 00:51:12,557
He will be the fortunate one
to choose you.

596
00:51:14,538 --> 00:51:17,996
He will be the one
to whom congratulations are due.

597
00:51:22,179 --> 00:51:25,171
Esther, my arm.

598
00:51:43,433 --> 00:51:45,560
The scroll is on the stool.

599
00:51:45,702 --> 00:51:48,296
You may begin whenever you are ready.

600
00:51:52,476 --> 00:51:54,034
Is there a problem?

601
00:51:55,245 --> 00:51:58,703
Did they not tell you I weary
at this procession of candidates?

602
00:52:00,283 --> 00:52:03,116
I simply wanted someone to...

603
00:52:05,155 --> 00:52:08,613
Wait.
You are the one who read to me before.

604
00:52:08,725 --> 00:52:11,455
You tried to beguile me with love stories.

605
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:16,289
Did you not think I had the sense
to see through your little parable?

606
00:52:16,399 --> 00:52:19,459
The arrogance! You speak to me
as if I was this Rachel

607
00:52:19,569 --> 00:52:21,833
in need of help to look after
my father's sheep.

608
00:52:21,938 --> 00:52:25,396
- My lord, I meant no...
- And this is how you come to see me?

609
00:52:26,743 --> 00:52:28,802
Your only adornment before your

610
00:52:29,713 --> 00:52:31,112
one night with the King.

611
00:52:32,816 --> 00:52:35,979
It is, Your Majesty.

612
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:40,878
You consider yourself of so little worth

613
00:52:42,092 --> 00:52:46,222
- that I can purchase your love so cheaply?
- I was taught

614
00:52:49,533 --> 00:52:54,163
that when you visit a king,
rather than expect a gift,

615
00:52:54,271 --> 00:52:57,069
one should bring one to lay at his feet.

616
00:53:06,750 --> 00:53:10,208
This is my most
valuable possession in the world.

617
00:53:14,991 --> 00:53:19,951
It is my past, my present, and my future.

618
00:53:21,331 --> 00:53:24,061
And all of it is yours.

619
00:53:31,975 --> 00:53:36,708
Some would call you foolish indeed,
as they would call your Jacob.

620
00:53:36,813 --> 00:53:41,113
Of all commodities, love is the easiest,

621
00:53:43,253 --> 00:53:45,278
and most cheaply purchased.

622
00:53:49,192 --> 00:53:51,786
If it is for sale, my lord,

623
00:53:53,697 --> 00:53:54,755
it is not love.

624
00:53:56,433 --> 00:53:57,695
Even you.

625
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:03,471
Even you must have a price.

626
00:54:03,673 --> 00:54:06,141
I am neither a buyer

627
00:54:08,979 --> 00:54:10,742
nor a seller of love.

628
00:54:14,217 --> 00:54:15,946
Suppose, my lady,

629
00:54:16,453 --> 00:54:19,616
a man offered you a more treasured gift,

630
00:54:20,657 --> 00:54:23,558
say, a kingdom.

631
00:54:39,175 --> 00:54:42,633
The only gift I would accept

632
00:54:44,381 --> 00:54:46,315
is your heart.

633
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:53,321
Then it is yours.

634
00:54:54,591 --> 00:54:58,049
And you did not serve
seven years to get it.

635
00:54:58,561 --> 00:55:02,463
Tell me Esther of Susa,
who are you really?

636
00:55:05,168 --> 00:55:07,261
Tell me of your people.

637
00:55:08,204 --> 00:55:10,695
Teach me of your ways.

638
00:55:13,076 --> 00:55:14,703
My father taught me

639
00:55:17,314 --> 00:55:19,748
it takes the glory of God

640
00:55:20,216 --> 00:55:23,049
to conceal a matter,

641
00:55:24,187 --> 00:55:28,146
and the honor of kings to search it out.

642
00:55:34,497 --> 00:55:36,795
Then marry me.

643
00:55:40,136 --> 00:55:45,039
And we shall spend an eternity
discovering this truth,

644
00:55:47,143 --> 00:55:48,474
together.

645
00:56:48,138 --> 00:56:50,698
Persians, your queen!

646
00:56:57,213 --> 00:57:00,740
Know you how many times I tried to
come for you after that first night?

647
00:57:05,955 --> 00:57:07,946
How many evenings
I spent counting the stars

648
00:57:08,057 --> 00:57:10,321
to keep my mind off of you?

649
00:57:16,666 --> 00:57:19,066
How many excuses I created

650
00:57:19,803 --> 00:57:21,930
just to avoid the other candidates?
