1
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,673
What ya doing over there?

2
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,674
I have to go.

3
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,069
Why?

4
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:27,874
A job.

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,433
Funny hours.

6
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,479
Funny job.

7
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,234
Will I see you again?

8
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:39,869
No.

9
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,470
You weren't wearing
that earlier, were you?

10
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,311
- I brought it.
- Thank God!

11
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,193
You look like a creep.

12
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,358
You have great hands.

13
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,434
- How am I doing, Tommy?
- Two minutes, Jack.

14
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,637
You're giving me an ulcer, Jack.

15
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,028
I am early.

16
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,160
45 seconds
does not qualify as early, Jack.

17
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:15,153
- Who does your tuxedo these days?
- Moon.

18
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,914
Well, go to China Boy.
Look like you crawled out of bed.

19
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:22,598
"Be the envy of your friends
with Miracle Hair"?

20
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,599
This is paint, Frank.

21
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,639
No, it's a magical sheath that
simulates a dazzling head of hair.

22
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,952
- Frank, this is paint!
- Just help me put it on.

23
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,471
You're supposed to spray
in a circular motion.

24
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,232
Thank you.

25
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,073
Good evening and welcome
to the Starfire Lounge.

26
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,157
My name is Frank Baker.

27
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,509
88 keys across from me
is my little brother, Jack.

28
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,877
My brother and I have been
playing together for how long, Jack?

29
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,829
31 years.

30
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,510
That's a lot of water
under the bridge, huh, Jack?

31
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,999
A lot of water.

32
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,636
Things were different then.
I was 11, Jack was 7.

33
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,593
The only one who'd listen to us
was the family cat, Cecil.

34
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:25,592
We must have shaved 3 lives
off that cat, huh, Jack?

35
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,919
But seriously, it's been
15 years since Jack and I

36
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,150
stepped on stage as professionals.

37
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:36,597
But though we've played some
of the finest venues in the world,

38
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:40,639
there's always been
a very special place for us.

39
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:45,756
That place is this place.
The Starfire Lounge.

40
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,549
Why?

41
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,476
I guess you could just say...

42
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,509
the people.

43
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,995
Terrific, boys, terrific.
Yes, sir!

44
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,795
You're just what we needed
on a night like this.

45
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,635
Thanks, Lloyd.

46
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,877
Only Jack, do me a favor?

47
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:30,153
If you want to smoke on stage,
put on a pair of sunglasses

48
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,436
and go play with
the niggers on State Street.

49
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,031
Here you go, fellas.
Ought to buy you more lessons.

50
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,154
Do you know when you'd
want us to come back?

51
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,469
I'll call you.

52
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,270
I thought,
the way our schedule is,

53
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,476
it might be a good idea...

54
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,268
I'll call you.

55
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,156
Count it.
Count it!

56
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,355
Jack!

57
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,431
Count the fucking money, Frank.

58
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,593
It's all here.

59
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,233
I'll be talking to you, Lloyd.

60
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,593
Very nice, Jack. Very nice.

61
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,034
Fuck him.

62
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,238
This isn't the Pine Tree Inn
on Route 81.

63
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,108
- Fuck him.
- Terrific. Fuck him.

64
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,678
- Are we on for tomorrow night?
- Maybe Thursday.

65
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,713
I hear the harpist
at the Sheraton has appendicitis.

66
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,749
Hey!

67
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,758
Don't forget your hair.

68
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:54,039
I think I'm ready for
"Oh What Fun it is to Ride".

69
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,712
Your mom got a new friend?

70
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,959
Uh-huh.

71
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,309
Sounds big. What's he do?

72
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,350
Kind of like a lawyer,
but the hours are more regular.

73
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,471
All I know is, one day
he came to take the TV away,

74
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,353
and ended up staying for dinner.

75
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,957
What happened to
the Donut King?

76
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,869
Married.

77
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,789
No breakfast.
Maybe they had a fight.

78
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,309
Nina!

79
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,513
Gotta go. Teach me later?

80
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,115
I'm coming!

81
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,475
Are you bothering
Mr. Baker again?

82
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,789
No, Mom.

83
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,076
Hey!

84
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,669
Get up.

85
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,676
Thank you Mahalu.
That concludes this evening's show.

86
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,798
Jack and I hope you enjoyed
yourselves as much as we did.

87
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,229
And...

88
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,436
which means
"Paddle home safely."

89
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,113
You want to see me, Charlie.

90
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,431
Frankie! Yeah, come on in.

91
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,755
- Little slow tonight.
- Mondays.

92
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,315
- How is Jack?
- Okay.

93
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,916
I wanted to see you alone because...

94
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,432
The kitchen help, maids,
they love him. He makes me nervous.

95
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,477
Sometimes he makes me nervous.

96
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,154
Well, anyway...

97
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,712
- What is this?
- Your pay.

98
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,389
What about tomorrow night?

99
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,598
It's all there. Both nights.

100
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,279
What are you saying, Charlie?

101
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:23,479
You and Jack have been
working here a long time.

102
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,909
12 years.

103
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,914
Maybe it's time we took
a vacation from one another.

104
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,153
Vacation?

105
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,153
Come on, it's Monday night!
You said so yourself.

106
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,992
I got the pianos for two nights.

107
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,511
It wasn't even half full
out there tonight.

108
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,433
I have six waiters in the back
listening to basketball.

109
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,919
I gotta move the liquor.

110
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,231
So, I have to fill the tables.
It's a matter of economics.

111
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:50,435
I love you guys.
You're class.

112
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,228
But people today...

113
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,119
they don't know class

114
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:57,272
if it walks up and
grabs them by the balls.

115
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,994
15 years, no one's paid us off.

116
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,470
He made the deal.
There's no shame in it.

117
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,588
We gotta talk.

118
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,269
Talk!

119
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,069
I've been thinking maybe
we should make some changes.

120
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,190
Maybe we should take on a singer.

121
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,796
It's just an idea.
I want your opinion.

122
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,152
We go half on everything, right?

123
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,630
I wouldn't say
exactly half, would you?

124
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,598
We agreed it I did the business,
I'd be entitled to a little extra.

125
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,638
- Is that what we agreed?
- Yeah, that's what we agreed.

126
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:49,995
If you're unhappy...

127
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,798
- I'm not unhappy.
- If you want to...

128
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:54,269
assume more of the financial
responsibility, I'd be glad.

129
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,953
How much for the singer?

130
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,835
20%. With additional bookings,
we'll come out ahead.

131
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,309
What?

132
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,869
Two pianos isn't enough anymore.

133
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,714
Never was.

134
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,277
I appreciate your punctuality,
Miss...

135
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,590
Moran.
Monica Moran.

136
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,199
Alright, Miss Moran.

137
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,669
Actually,
that's my stage name.

138
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:23,195
- I'm sorry.
- Monica Moran.

139
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,239
That's my stage name.
My real name is Blanche.

140
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,029
Blanche?

141
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,919
No romance, right?

142
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,351
That's why I came up with Monica.
It's what I prefer.

143
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,839
Well, that's alright.

144
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,633
But if you call my house
and my mother answers,

145
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,274
ask for Blanche.

146
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,910
If not, she'll think you have
the wrong number and hang up.

147
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,268
Yes, well. What is it
you'd like to do for us?

148
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:55,673
"The Candy Man".
Is that all right?

149
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,559
That's one of Jack's favorites.

150
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,350
I almost forgot you were there.

151
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,111
Here's the instructions.

152
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,469
He knows it.

153
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,070
Really?
Isn't that a coincidence?

154
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,548
Small world.

155
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,309
Shall we?

156
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,479
Thank you, that's enough.

157
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,189
Miss Moran!

158
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,116
Miss Moran!

159
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,516
Blanche!

160
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,189
Sorry.

161
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,517
I get so
caught up in it sometimes.

162
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,233
It's scary.

163
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,708
Yes, it is.

164
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,950
Well, okay. Thank you.

165
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,912
37 girls and not one
who can carry a tune.

166
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,513
There was a certain
surreal quality to it.

167
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,153
God damn it!

168
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:21,908
Shit!

169
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,953
Shoe.

170
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,357
Is this where the auditions are?

171
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:34,318
Where the auditions were.
We're finished.

172
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,509
What about me?

173
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,718
You're an hour and a half late.

174
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,998
I had trouble catching a cab.

175
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:48,195
Punctuality,
first rule of show business.

176
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,393
This is show business?

177
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,556
Look Miss, we're tired,

178
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,429
you have gum on your lip
and we're going home.

179
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,195
Just like that, huh?

180
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:04,520
I come down here,
break a heel

181
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:08,593
and you won't give me a chance
because I'm a little late!

182
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:11,911
An hour an a half late.
Want me to say it again?

183
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,551
Well, it's not exactly
bewitching me.

184
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,357
Besides, you're not
going anywhere.

185
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,749
I beg your pardon?

186
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,591
Intuition. I had a hunch
about this all day.

187
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:27,194
Only, in my mind,
it was a little more glamorous.

188
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,910
So, where's the winner?

189
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,629
See? Intuition.

190
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:47,909
Jack...

191
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,713
What have we got to lose?

192
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:57,875
Terrific.

193
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:59,755
38!

194
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,878
What is that, "38"?
Do you guys have a code?

195
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,148
Name?

196
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,673
Susie Diamond.

197
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,589
Catchy.

198
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,919
Do you have any previous
experience as a singer?

199
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,109
No.

200
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,670
Any entertainment experience?

201
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:27,669
Last couple of years I've been
on call for Triple A Escort Service.

202
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:37,354
What would you like to share?

203
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,553
"More Than You Know".

204
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,514
Slow, okay?

205
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,069
So?

206
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:24,873
Did I not tell everyone: 7.15?

207
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,998
- She'll get here.
- Like the day of the auditions.

208
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,355
Jesus!

209
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,149
How is my hair?

210
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,108
Awe inspiring.

211
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,075
Well, yours is not.
Let me run a comb through it.

212
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,719
- Get out of here.
- Come on, stand still.

213
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,598
It won't hurt you.
Hold on.

214
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:45,479
I'll hit you, I swear.

215
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:52,313
- You hit me.
- I told you I was.

216
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,152
I am a little wound up.

217
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,992
- You're a fucking alarm clock.
- I just wish she'd get here.

218
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,309
She's here.

219
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,032
Christ. Look at her.

220
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,916
Good evening, Miss Diamond.
You're late.

221
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,517
Guest vocalist?
Who's next week, Beverly Sills?

222
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,910
How come you guys have
your picture on the poster?

223
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,957
We'll talk later. Your dress?

224
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:19,829
What are you talking about?

225
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,958
Is there a language problem?
Where's your dress for tonight?

226
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,588
Do I look like I'm naked?

227
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,595
With that?

228
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,195
What are you, insane?

229
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,191
Are you going trick or treating?

230
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,680
- He doesn't like my dress, right?
- We don't have much time.

231
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,638
What are you doing?
Don't grab me. Don't!

232
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,072
- What are you, an eight?
- A six.

233
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,633
How about this?

234
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,628
Here. How is this?

235
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,031
We'll take them from your share.

236
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,589
You are a prince.

237
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:19,630
Jack, touch me up, will you?
Remember, Jack and I are on first.

238
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,918
I do the set-up and introduce you.

239
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,029
And you say?

240
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,760
Good evening ladies and gentlemen,
I can't tell you... what is that?

241
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,719
Winding your watch these days?

242
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,235
- A little emergency, Ray.
- "Miracle Hair".

243
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,834
- Who is this, Minnie Pearl?
- We need some scissors.

244
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,878
I want 75 minutes, Frankie.

245
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:39,793
Don't worry,
they'll cut this off. Scissors!

246
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,118
Fix your tie.

247
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,471
Good luck, guys.
It's a pretty ugly group.

248
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,551
They send back the cheese balls.

249
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,034
No scissors.

250
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,829
Good evening.

251
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:01,196
Welcome to the Ambassador Lounge.

252
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,192
My name's Frank Baker.

253
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,598
And no, you're not seeing double.
It's just my brother, Jack.

254
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,278
- Just a sip. For the butterflies.
- Okay, but no lipstick.

255
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,919
What's that on your wrist?

256
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,839
The next hour and a half
of my life.

257
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,399
<i>... a very special place.</i>

258
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,719
And that place is this place,

259
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,553
the Ambassador Lounge.

260
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,072
Please give a warm welcome
to a very special lady

261
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,196
with a very special way
of singing a song.

262
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,078
Miss Susie Diamond!

263
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,513
Ladies and Gentlemen...

264
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,674
- Hit the switch.
- Switch?

265
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,598
What fucking switch?

266
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,908
Pardon me.

267
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:01,078
I can't tell you how
thrilled I am to be here.

268
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,434
<i>I work at the Palace Ballroom</i>

269
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,195
<i>but gee, that palace is cheap.</i>

270
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,599
<i>When I get home</i>

271
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:23,797
<i>to my chilly old room</i>

272
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:27,555
<i>I'm much too tired to sleep.</i>

273
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,991
<i>I'm one of those lady teachers,</i>

274
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:40,918
<i>a beautiful hostess, you know.</i>

275
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:45,671
<i>One that the Palace features</i>

276
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,915
<i>at exactly</i>

277
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,398
<i>a dime a throw.</i>

278
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:58,879
<i>Ten cents a dance,</i>

279
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:01,508
<i>that's what they pay me.</i>

280
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:05,392
<i>Gosh, how they weigh me down.</i>

281
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:10,476
<i>Ten cents a dance,</i>

282
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,512
<i>Pansies and wallflowers.</i>

283
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:19,151
<i>Tough guys who tear my gown.</i>

284
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,079
<i>7 to midnight,</i>

285
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,356
<i>I hear the drums.</i>

286
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:32,439
<i>Loudly the saxophone blows.</i>

287
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:38,512
<i>Trumpets are tearing</i>
<i>my eardrums.</i>

288
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:42,829
<i>Customers crush my toes.</i>

289
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,670
<i>Sometimes I think</i>

290
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:51,637
<i>I have found my hero.</i>

291
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:56,074
<i>But it's a queer romance.</i>

292
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:02,351
<i>All that you need is a ticket.</i>

293
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:07,356
<i>Come on, big boy.</i>

294
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:13,193
<i>Ten cents a dance.</i>

295
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:26,358
She says "fucking" in front of
an entire room of people.

296
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,317
- I apologized.
- Did you hear it?

297
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,589
Fucking.

298
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,274
They were on their third Mai Tai
by the time I got out there.

299
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,156
Fucking.

300
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:35,834
For Christ's sake,
I said it, I didn't do it.

301
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:39,196
I don't think they were
that offended, do you?

302
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:42,870
We don't take tips
from dirty old men.

303
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,992
I was going to split it!

304
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:49,192
We do not take tips.
This goes to cost of the dress.

305
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:54,197
Then I want my picture
and my name on the poster.

306
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,794
And these shoes
are too fucking tight!

307
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,669
Nice girl.

308
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,314
<i>Where did you find her anyway?</i>

309
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,595
The girl.

310
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,789
She was a kid who hung around.
We gave her a break.

311
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,478
Give her a tip from me, will ya?

312
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:22,508
Smaller dress means a bigger crowd.

313
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,160
Here you go, guys.
Don't spend it all in one place.

314
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:29,835
Jack...

315
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,759
maybe you want to count it.

316
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,951
You know we trust you, Lloyd.

317
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,119
Frankie, while you're here,

318
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,349
how is next week for you guys?

319
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,589
We'll call you.

320
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:54,469
Did you see his face?
Did you see it?

321
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,194
The world is good.

322
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:59,279
Don't let anybody
tell you any different.

323
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,799
Good night, Baker.

324
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,753
How ya doing, Henry?

325
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,434
Can't complain.

326
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,159
What do you think of the kid?

327
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,917
When does his mother
pick him up?

328
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,637
He's been playing here for a year.

329
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,598
You ought to come around
more often, Jack.

330
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,632
So how about Jack Baker?

331
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,431
Still stomping at the Sheraton?

332
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,313
Keeps me out of trouble.

333
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,559
Then what are you doing here?

334
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,239
Looking for trouble.

335
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,595
Try to control your excitement, Ed.

336
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:30,999
Let me see your teeth.

337
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,673
<i>Yeah, they gotta to go.</i>

338
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:40,549
5 is my guess, maybe more.
Don't know till I get in there.

339
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:42,989
And bones?

340
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:45,037
Those days are over, I'm afraid.

341
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:48,552
Don't worry, we'll knock him out.
He won't feel a thing.

342
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,755
Excuse me.

343
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,868
Should have brushed, pal.

344
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:57,679
Bernie at the Hilton said

345
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:00,434
the nights we play,
she's triples her tips.

346
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,788
That's because there's Chivas.
And pearls, not polyester.

347
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:05,989
I don't understand.

348
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:09,118
- You're saying we should...
- Ask for a percentage of the bar.

349
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,909
Mel Torme doesn't get
a percentage of the bar.

350
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,593
Maybe he never asked.

351
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,834
Are you hearing this?

352
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,953
How much is she drawing?

353
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:22,635
Well, two months ago
she was wearing a Timex,

354
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:26,429
and now a Seiko.
The Hilton didn't put it there.

355
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,876
You're not actually
listening to this, are you?

356
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:32,591
- Jerry Stein books the Hilton?
- For 8 years!

357
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,995
Forget about the bar.
We'd look like amateurs.

358
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,870
But why not bump them
for an extra 100 up front?

359
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,708
I don't like it.

360
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,992
It's not how we play the game.

361
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,511
The game is changing.

362
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:11,273
No, thanks. I never touch
American cigarettes.

363
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:14,680
3.50 a pack and I go through them!

364
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,114
Paris Opals.

365
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,553
3.50 a pack.

366
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,913
Know how much that is a piece?

367
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,235
17 cents.

368
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:26,709
17 and a half.

369
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,438
I figured it out once.

370
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:32,116
If you stick it in your mouth,
it might as well be the best.

371
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,514
Merry Christmas!

372
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,355
What do you think?

373
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:47,278
It's me. I thought I'd
give the kids a thrill.

374
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,994
Be bright and early Monday.
We got a long drive.

375
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:52,034
Merry, merry.

376
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,275
I don't know.

377
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,556
It's hard figuring you
and Egghead as brothers.

378
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:00,075
The hospital might have
scrambled the babies.

379
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,199
This is a last soul.

380
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,831
Well, <i>au revoir.</i>

381
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,559
Like a cup of coffee?

382
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,153
Now? On Christmas Eve?

383
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:29,675
No. It gives me the shakes.

384
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,515
I better go home, rest the pipes.

385
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:35,789
Want me to walk you?

386
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:42,156
No... thanks.

387
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:48,839
Listen, you're not
going soft on me, are you?

388
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:52,400
You won't start dreaming about me
and waking up all sweaty,

389
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,949
and look at me like a princess
when I burp?

390
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:57,589
Forget it.

391
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:00,430
It would be too creepy,
with us working together.

392
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,915
Hurry. You're a nickel down
on your cigarette.

393
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,433
Super Chief around the corner.

394
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:20,315
Bathroom. Super Chief.
Around the corner.

395
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,271
No, I left my dog here
this morning.

396
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,839
Regular hours are 8 to 5.

397
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:29,590
I know. I was passing and
thought I'd drop by and see him.

398
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:32,839
You can check on him,
tomorrow between 8 and 5.

399
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,399
I thought I could just...

400
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:38,033
We are not
communicating here, are we?

401
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,556
You want to know
if he's okay, right?

402
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,429
Yeah.

403
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:50,398
- Alright. Hold on.
- The name is Baker.

404
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:52,152
Save it! What's he look like?

405
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,637
Black. Lab.

406
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,759
The dead ones are in the cold room.

407
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:21,272
No, just a couple of poodles.

408
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,635
I want my dog.

409
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:36,236
- Listen, get out of here.
- No, you listen you little fuck.

410
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:40,992
Off your ass, get my dog or I'll
stick the magazine down your throat.

411
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,117
- We communicating now?
- Yeah, all right.

412
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,353
Baker, right?

413
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,832
How about a little light?

414
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,674
Eddie!

415
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:08,715
Forget it. He's still
circling the airport.

416
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,709
I didn't know you were
coming home tonight.

417
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:16,789
We sort of
skipped the paperwork.

418
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,437
Besides, it's Christmas, right?

419
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,919
Where's your ma tonight?

420
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,078
Out with Bigfoot again?

421
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,793
Did you play her the solo?

422
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,470
Maybe tomorrow, she said.

423
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,397
Just you and me again, huh?

424
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,234
From Hurley's?

425
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:56,111
Eighty proof.
Think you can handle it?

426
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,599
Go easy now.

427
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,554
Jack?

428
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,714
Yeah?

429
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:20,158
Can I stay here tonight?
Even if she comes home alone?

430
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:23,989
Okay.

431
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,998
He's seeing you off, right?

432
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,512
Jack, this is not possible.

433
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:47,998
We're playing a resort hotel.
You can't take a dog.

434
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,479
It's not possible.

435
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,348
It's possible.

436
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,157
Get this.
Each room is an event.

437
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,550
An excursion into
unprecedented luxury.

438
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:05,633
Outside, the adventure continues
with your own private terrace.

439
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,998
You don't think it
really looks like that, do you?

440
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:10,868
There are pictures right here.

441
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,638
Hear that, Jack? Pictures.

442
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:16,915
Welcome to the road, Dorothy.
You're about to lose your virginity.

443
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,513
Why, thank you.

444
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,551
I'll see you boys inside.

445
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,950
I took the right side of the closet.

446
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:24,274
Since my bed's on the right,
I think it makes sense.

447
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,948
- Right.
- We'll do the drawers the same.

448
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,958
Unless you want the right.

449
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,799
No, you take the right.

450
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:39,558
Looks like Carmen Miranda
had an accident in my room.

451
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:42,271
They must get a deal on these.

452
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,639
What do you make of this?

453
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,195
Kiwi.

454
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,550
It's got more hair than you, Frank.

455
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:53,551
No peeking at tub time.

456
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,678
What the hell is this?

457
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,751
Do you hear this?

458
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:18,954
I do now.

459
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:22,749
Great! Before we play a note,
we're gonna get thrown out.

460
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,238
So she's playing a little music.

461
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,789
She's got the
Harry James Orchestra in there!

462
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:28,870
Ellington.

463
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,149
Frank!

464
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,355
What?

465
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,238
You're looking a little tense.

466
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:41,598
Of course! It's 2 AM and she's
going to wake up everyone!

467
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,029
See?

468
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,474
Massage?

469
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,679
Down here, gorgeous.

470
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,272
I figured you for jockeys.

471
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,194
New socks?

472
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,950
Mark my words.

473
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:01,351
From this night forward,
our lives will never be the same.

474
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:05,559
Frank, you get a lot of pop
out of two glasses of champagne.

475
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,275
Long way from
"Hula Girl Hideaway", eh?

476
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,476
Remember?
Banana trees in the lobby.

477
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:13,312
Takahama's Tahitian.

478
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,959
Did we play there?

479
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:17,793
- I thought we stopped for teriyaki.
- Three nights.

480
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:21,311
It's amazing. He can remember
ever place we ever played.

481
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:24,074
The day, the month, the year,
how many shows, you name it.

482
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,839
When was Takahama's?

483
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,279
August '74.

484
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,268
See? He's brilliant.
Really!

485
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:34,515
Brilliant!

486
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,029
Hey, Jack.

487
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,554
You are brilliant.

488
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:45,589
Thanks.

489
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:48,389
It's the same with music.
Should've seen him as a kid.

490
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,869
Nobody could
ride the keys like Jack.

491
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:54,513
Mrs. Simpson played
something once, and he had it.

492
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,035
Really?

493
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:01,119
I never won a single
blue ribbon until the day Jack

494
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:04,158
showed up drunk
at spring recital and played

495
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:07,518
"One O'clock Jump"
instead of "Clare de Lune".

496
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:09,668
The mood just hit me.

497
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:26,068
"Moonglow".

498
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,396
- "Moonglow"?
- High school. I couldn't dance.

499
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:38,632
Jack did the box step
with me for a week.

500
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:41,599
It wasn't a week.

501
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,194
- You two are that close?
- He paid me.

502
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:48,393
It was my first social with Donna.
We fell in love on the dance floor.

503
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:51,632
I have a beautiful wife,
two beautiful children,

504
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:53,677
all because of my brother.

505
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:56,070
You overestimate the box step.

506
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:59,278
It was just like this,
on our honeymoon.

507
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:02,069
The moon, the stars.

508
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:04,029
Remember, Jack?

509
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:05,754
I wasn't there.

510
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:08,235
Right.

511
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:10,949
My first solo gig.

512
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:16,953
God, she was gorgeous.

513
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:21,271
I couldn't believe she was mine.

514
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:26,352
How come I got so lucky, Jack?

515
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:29,073
You're a lucky guy.

516
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:30,869
You know?

517
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:34,080
I never kissed my wife
on New Year's Eve.

518
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:39,189
I'm always on stage somewhere.

519
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:46,198
I think I'm drunk.
You two dance.

520
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:47,709
I'm gonna...

521
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:49,353
go sit with the wallflowers.

522
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:50,999
I'm not used to leading.

523
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:56,110
Come on, give the girl a glide.

524
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:59,192
No. I think your little brother
prefers to dance alone.

525
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,234
No, thanks.

526
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:09,550
I never touch French cigarettes.

527
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:30,799
Your brother's a good dancer.

528
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:32,919
Big heartbreaker.

529
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:35,992
A couple of turns, that was it.

530
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:37,549
Really?

531
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:39,639
Got them right in the knees.

532
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,389
Practically had to
carry the girls off the floor.

533
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:44,435
Really?

534
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:48,231
Have another drink, Frank.

535
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:49,949
No, I'm sleepy.

536
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:51,798
Go to sleep then.

537
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:56,949
Alright.

538
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:15,556
I think I just lost my chaperone.

539
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:17,994
You're safe.

540
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:25,714
So where do you keep
your blue ribbons, Mr. Baker?

541
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:29,279
Frank keeps them.

542
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:41,359
Nice night, huh?

543
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:50,193
It's quiet, it's like...

544
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:53,390
the whole world is asleep.

545
00:45:58,440 --> 00:45:59,509
Careful.

546
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,317
I had too much to drink.

547
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:06,476
Champagne goes right to my head.

548
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,955
- Maybe we should call it a night.
- Yeah.

549
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:39,994
Miss Diamond!

550
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:46,035
These just arrived for you.

551
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:48,712
Looks like you have an admirer.

552
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:51,435
There's no card.

553
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:54,269
The gentleman said
he would be in contact with you.

554
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:58,558
He's with the cat food convention.
I can have put them in water.

555
00:46:58,720 --> 00:46:59,835
No, that's alright.

556
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:13,155
It's nice.

557
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:16,509
It's nice.

558
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:31,793
It's been 5 years since
I've seen you without a cigarette.

559
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:34,634
The whole room upstairs
smells like an ashtray.

560
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:36,871
You know that? The sheets,

561
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:41,395
the carpets, the drapes.
The towels, my tux, my shirt.

562
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:44,078
Want to smell my shirt?

563
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:45,474
Maybe later.

564
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:49,276
I'm not kidding. Do you know
what an insidious habit that is?

565
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:53,433
How many do you smoke a day?
Must be hundreds!

566
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:59,591
This is just a wild stab,
but is something bothering you?

567
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:03,234
Leave her alone.

568
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:05,154
I mean it.

569
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:09,230
This isn't a hatcheck girl you can
leave behind at the Sheraton.

570
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:11,231
You've got two shows
a night with her.

571
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:15,838
You don't know what you're saying.

572
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:18,913
I know trouble,
and it's name starts with 'S'.

573
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:21,117
Do me a favor, Frank.
Relax.

574
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:25,239
Do me a favor, little brother.
Stick to cocktail waitresses.

575
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:33,759
Meeting here each night,

576
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:36,229
sharing these few moments,

577
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:39,314
I feel as if we're becoming
one big happy family.

578
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,912
The fine wine, the music...

579
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:45,789
What's all this mean?
I don't know. Who's to say?

580
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:47,519
All I can tell you is...

581
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:50,274
it makes it very special
for us here...

582
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:53,199
to have you out there.
Right, Susie?

583
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:54,429
Right, Frank.

584
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:55,994
Right, Jack?

585
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:57,469
Right.

586
00:49:57,880 --> 00:50:00,519
But if I can add one more thing.

587
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:02,793
I love you, Frank.

588
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:05,030
What?

589
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:08,349
I love you.

590
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:11,359
I just wanted to say it.

591
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:21,030
You came in late on
"Little Green Apples".

592
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:23,432
- Excuse me?
- You heard me.

593
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:27,030
No, Frank.
You came in early.

594
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:32,195
- You have for the past decade.
- I never missed a beat.

595
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:35,430
I never miss the beat!

596
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:37,318
That's because you make it up.

597
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:39,595
Take it back.

598
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:41,713
Take it back?
What's this, the 3rd grade?

599
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:43,074
Take it back!

600
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,558
Take a kiwi, Frank.

601
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:52,354
Go to bed, Frank,
or this will get ugly.

602
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:55,397
- Yeah?
- Yeah, come on.

603
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,116
It's the fucking Newlywed Game.

604
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:00,635
- You hit me.
- I told you I was going to.

605
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:14,117
Hello? Yeah.

606
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:19,553
No, this is 512-B.

607
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:21,915
Mr. Baker is in 512-A.

608
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:28,269
Urgent.

609
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:30,916
No, never mind. I'll get him.

610
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:34,833
We made a deal.

611
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:37,516
Training wheels for a month,
then we would see.

612
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:38,999
He ran into somebody's car?

613
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:42,516
Mrs. Ramadino's station wagon.

614
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:44,159
It was parked on the street.

615
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:47,278
Got a pencil?
Pencil anybody?

616
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:49,436
Here.

617
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:52,273
I want you to take down
the New Year show.

618
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,116
10 o'clock you start with
"Thanks for the Memories".

619
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:57,589
- Then you segue into...
- "Happy Days Are Here Again".

620
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:01,230
- I know the show.
- Then the song from Camelot.

621
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:07,038
Don't hesitate to call.

622
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:08,555
Come on.

623
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:16,318
Any word from Egghead?

624
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:21,839
I saved you the crossword.

625
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:26,189
Thanks.

626
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:43,908
Well, happy reading.

627
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:19,829
Hear anything yet?

628
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:21,915
Not a peep.

629
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:27,357
I'm going to take a bath.

630
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:50,749
Yeah?

631
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:52,755
It's Frank.

632
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:54,988
So how's little Frank?

633
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:58,196
Good. That's a relief.

634
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:02,429
No, I understand.
Call me when you have time.

635
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:03,794
<i>What are you doing?</i>

636
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:06,714
We're taking a bath.

637
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:08,999
I mean...

638
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,639
Susie's taking a bath.
I'm doing the crossword puzzle.

639
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:14,389
Okay.

640
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:15,749
Bye.

641
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:19,035
Kid's in the pink.

642
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:20,915
Good.

643
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:15,678
<i>Boys and girls,</i>
<i>find a friend. This is it!</i>

644
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:19,833
Ten, nine, eight, seven...

645
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:24,154
six, five, four, three...

646
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:26,432
two, one...

647
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:23,074
So...

648
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:26,151
make any resolutions?

649
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:29,394
No. You?

650
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:34,279
No. I figure that stuff
is a bunch of crap anyway.

651
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:38,749
- You do what you do, right?
- That's right.

652
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:44,630
Old Egghead would've blown
a gasket seeing us here tonight!

653
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:52,112
You're good, aren't you?

654
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:00,759
I can carry a tune.

655
01:01:02,520 --> 01:01:03,873
You're better than that.

656
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:14,232
I saw you guys once.

657
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:18,359
You and Frank.

658
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:21,554
At the Roosevelt.

659
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:24,958
Must've been a cheap date.

660
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:29,879
Soap convention.

661
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:31,435
Soap?

662
01:01:32,680 --> 01:01:35,274
Yeah, they got
a convention for everything.

663
01:01:35,560 --> 01:01:37,835
The guy was some
big roller in suds.

664
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:45,433
At least he was clean.
Some guys you wouldn't believe.

665
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:51,670
The older ones,
they weren't so bad.

666
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:54,950
Nice. Polite.

667
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:57,318
Pulled you chair out for you.

668
01:02:00,040 --> 01:02:01,439
But the younger ones...

669
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,150
It wasn't so bad.
I'd get a nice piece of steak,

670
01:02:11,320 --> 01:02:13,675
flowers, sometimes even a gift.

671
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:15,592
Usually whatever the guy was into.

672
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:18,230
I got a set of
socket wrenches once.

673
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:24,109
Guy looked at me like
he'd given me 4 dozen roses.

674
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:32,108
But I stayed at
the Hartford one time.

675
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:39,114
You should see the rooms.
All satin and velvet.

676
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:41,114
And the bed...

677
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:44,397
royal blue, trimmed in lace
clean as snow.

678
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:50,597
Hard to believe a room like that
don't change your life.

679
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:53,754
But it don't.

680
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:56,071
The bed may be magic,

681
01:02:56,760 --> 01:02:58,193
but the mirror isn't.

682
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:01,670
Still wake up the same old Susie.

683
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:07,514
I didn't always.

684
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:09,274
You know, I mean...

685
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:12,118
if I liked the guy.

686
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:19,314
I never liked
the Hartford much myself.

687
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:33,637
My neck, it's so tight.

688
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:36,590
Usually singing relaxes me.

689
01:03:37,160 --> 01:03:38,912
But tonight...

690
01:03:45,840 --> 01:03:46,875
Thanks.

691
01:06:09,640 --> 01:06:12,154
You'd make a hell of a fireman,
you know that?

692
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:21,034
Do you practice that at home
with a stopwatch?

693
01:06:24,080 --> 01:06:25,308
I didn't want to wake you.

694
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:28,599
I'm an early riser.

695
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:39,549
I didn't expect you to
buy be a corsage this morning.

696
01:06:42,680 --> 01:06:44,238
Your high school ring is safe.

697
01:07:06,680 --> 01:07:07,749
Shit!

698
01:07:12,120 --> 01:07:13,189
Shit!

699
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:51,350
<i>That takes care of</i>
<i>the week of the 5th.</i>

700
01:07:51,840 --> 01:07:55,355
After that, we got the Avedon
or the Plaza, 4 day turn.

701
01:07:55,520 --> 01:07:56,839
What do you think, Jack?

702
01:07:58,760 --> 01:08:00,034
You with me, Jack?

703
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:02,552
The Avedon's a dump.

704
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:05,839
There's no cover, no minimum.
They water their drinks.

705
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,718
Strictly the Fuller Brush crowd.

706
01:08:08,600 --> 01:08:11,956
It's not that bad. Besides,
Blacky Carson books the Avedon.

707
01:08:13,560 --> 01:08:15,152
He's always been good to us.

708
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:20,637
- He hasn't been that good.
- Okay, we'll take the Plaza.

709
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:23,758
- Then the Capri for 5 days.
- Not the Luau Lounge again.

710
01:08:23,960 --> 01:08:26,315
What the matter?
They don't salt their peanuts?

711
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:29,080
Singing "Feelings",
knee-deep in paper orchids

712
01:08:29,240 --> 01:08:31,071
and plastic Tiki lamps

713
01:08:31,240 --> 01:08:34,391
is not my idea
of a fun evening.

714
01:08:36,040 --> 01:08:38,679
Fun? Who promised you fun?
We get paid, remember?

715
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:40,876
I'm saying,
maybe we should vote on it.

716
01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:46,871
Maybe we should ask Jack
what he thinks.

717
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:49,429
I don't have to.
I know what he thinks.

718
01:08:49,640 --> 01:08:52,074
It's 5 days, the money's green.
We're there.

719
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:57,712
Speaking about "Feelings",
you might brush up on the lyrics.

720
01:08:57,880 --> 01:09:00,394
The other night,
you sang the first verse twice.

721
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:01,675
Really?

722
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:05,239
That explains the gasps
I heard from the audience.

723
01:09:06,040 --> 01:09:10,556
We trashed the Avedon, the Luau.
What's your beef with "Feelings"?

724
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:11,995
Nothing.

725
01:09:15,680 --> 01:09:17,079
Except, who cares?

726
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:19,470
Does anybody really
need to hear "Feelings"

727
01:09:19,640 --> 01:09:21,039
again in a lifetime?

728
01:09:22,280 --> 01:09:23,793
It's like parsley.

729
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:25,996
Take it away,
nobody knows the difference.

730
01:09:26,160 --> 01:09:27,878
"Feelings" isn't parsley.

731
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:31,072
To you, "Feelings"
may be filet mignon.

732
01:09:31,440 --> 01:09:34,193
To me, it's parsley.
Less than parsley.

733
01:09:34,440 --> 01:09:37,113
Look, "Feelings",
despite what you think of it,

734
01:09:37,280 --> 01:09:39,669
is always a bright moment
and a crowd-pleaser.

735
01:09:39,840 --> 01:09:42,957
Consequently, we have
an obligation to perform it.

736
01:09:43,440 --> 01:09:45,556
The audience would be disappointed.

737
01:09:45,880 --> 01:09:48,713
They weren't crying
on New Year's Eve.

738
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:55,839
You passed over "Feelings"?

739
01:09:56,160 --> 01:09:57,229
Yeah.

740
01:09:58,520 --> 01:09:59,509
And...

741
01:09:59,680 --> 01:10:01,955
"Bali Hai" went out
with the bath water, too.

742
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:07,389
I see.

743
01:10:08,440 --> 01:10:11,716
The cat goes away and the mice
take over the orchestra.

744
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:12,471
Hey,

745
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:14,233
I ain't no mouse.

746
01:10:14,440 --> 01:10:15,998
That's right. You're parsley.

747
01:10:22,160 --> 01:10:25,277
This food's been sitting here
too long. It's making me sick.

748
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:37,277
Why don't you loosen the leash?

749
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:42,233
Let's not let a whiff of perfume
blow off 15 years. Be reasonable.

750
01:10:43,160 --> 01:10:46,835
I play 300 nights a year with you.
Is that reasonable enough?

751
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:21,592
Can I have a double vodka, please?

752
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:19,349
I was in the neighborhood.

753
01:13:31,400 --> 01:13:34,198
Listen, don't get nervous.
I just came by to...

754
01:13:37,360 --> 01:13:38,509
talk.

755
01:14:07,240 --> 01:14:09,151
I guess you found him, huh?

756
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:13,469
Yeah.

757
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:18,152
I came to walk Eddie.

758
01:14:18,760 --> 01:14:19,749
Come.

759
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:51,479
Terry's Tap Room.

760
01:14:54,520 --> 01:14:56,351
First gig we ever played.

761
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,594
The owner gave us that bottle,
but wouldn't open it.

762
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:01,749
How come?

763
01:15:02,240 --> 01:15:04,071
Told us to save it.

764
01:15:07,280 --> 01:15:09,555
He said someday it would
soften the edges of the bad times.

765
01:15:09,720 --> 01:15:11,870
And make the good ones
seem even better.

766
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:18,389
We should've drunk it before
we played Terry's Tap Room.

767
01:15:18,760 --> 01:15:20,079
Want some coffee?

768
01:15:27,640 --> 01:15:28,868
You want to leave?

769
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:31,675
Listen.

770
01:15:34,080 --> 01:15:36,275
The reason I came last night is...

771
01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:40,439
I'm thinking about leaving.

772
01:15:41,400 --> 01:15:42,435
The act.

773
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:49,678
I met this guy
at New Year's at the Hotel.

774
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:52,630
And he liked my voice.

775
01:15:55,080 --> 01:15:58,197
He thinks I can sell
cat food just by singing about it.

776
01:16:00,320 --> 01:16:01,514
It's crazy, huh?

777
01:16:05,080 --> 01:16:06,195
Take it.

778
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:09,990
I haven't decided yet.
I'm just thinking about it.

779
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:12,028
No, take it.

780
01:16:20,240 --> 01:16:22,435
How long have you been
taking care of the kid upstairs?

781
01:16:23,480 --> 01:16:24,913
I don't take care of her.

782
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:27,353
Didn't look that way to me.

783
01:16:27,800 --> 01:16:28,994
What's the difference?

784
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,958
Anyway, I know Frank
has us booked through March.

785
01:16:36,320 --> 01:16:37,799
Don't worry about Frank.

786
01:16:39,440 --> 01:16:40,634
What about you?

787
01:16:41,400 --> 01:16:42,992
What's that to do with anything?

788
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:49,515
Nothing. I don't want to
leave you guys with an empty mike.

789
01:16:52,040 --> 01:16:53,712
There's always another girl.

790
01:17:04,400 --> 01:17:05,389
Right.

791
01:17:11,400 --> 01:17:12,833
Thanks for the advice.

792
01:17:14,040 --> 01:17:15,189
I'll think it over.

793
01:18:28,040 --> 01:18:29,837
I told Frank I'm quitting.

794
01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:33,034
Congratulations.

795
01:18:34,760 --> 01:18:35,875
As of now.

796
01:18:41,640 --> 01:18:44,108
If you need a recommendation,
you let me know.

797
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,116
Jesus you're cold! You know that?

798
01:18:48,040 --> 01:18:50,235
You are like
a fucking razor blade.

799
01:18:50,720 --> 01:18:53,154
Careful, you'll have me thinking
you're going soft on me.

800
01:18:55,080 --> 01:18:58,152
You don't give a fuck, do you?
About anything.

801
01:18:59,920 --> 01:19:02,115
What do you want from me?
To tell you to stay?

802
01:19:02,360 --> 01:19:06,592
Beg on my knees for you to
save the Baker Boys from doom?

803
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:08,068
Forget it, sweetheart.

804
01:19:08,600 --> 01:19:11,273
We survived for 15 years
before you strutted on the scene.

805
01:19:11,880 --> 01:19:14,599
Two seconds and you're
bawling like a baby.

806
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:17,954
You should be wearing
a diaper, not a dress.

807
01:19:19,680 --> 01:19:21,432
You and he are brothers, aren't you?

808
01:19:22,280 --> 01:19:23,759
Let me tell you something.

809
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:28,118
They've dropped like flies.
We're still here!

810
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:30,830
We've never held
a day job in our lives.

811
01:19:31,360 --> 01:19:34,193
He's an easy target,
but add it up, he's done fine.

812
01:19:34,600 --> 01:19:36,511
Yeah, Frank has done great.

813
01:19:36,680 --> 01:19:39,956
He has the wife, kids,
little house in the suburbs.

814
01:19:40,840 --> 01:19:43,752
While his brother lives
a shitty apartment with a sick dog,

815
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:46,514
Little Orphan Annie and a chip
on his shoulder size of a Cadillac.

816
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:50,076
Listen, Princess.
We fucked twice, that's it.

817
01:19:50,640 --> 01:19:53,632
Once the sweat dries,
you still know shit about me.

818
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:57,993
I know one thing.
While Frank put his kids to bed,

819
01:19:58,160 --> 01:20:01,277
little brother Jack
was dusting off his dreams.

820
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:04,029
I was there.

821
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:06,439
I saw it in your face.

822
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:10,273
You're full of shit.
You're a fake.

823
01:20:11,200 --> 01:20:13,509
Every time you walk in those places,

824
01:20:13,960 --> 01:20:15,632
you're selling yourself cheap.

825
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,833
I know all about that.
I find myself at the end of the night

826
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,719
with some creep,
and I tell myself it doesn't matter.

827
01:20:23,200 --> 01:20:26,670
You kid yourself you've got
this empty place inside to put it.

828
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:29,474
But do it long enough
and all you are is empty.

829
01:20:30,920 --> 01:20:33,070
I didn't know whores
were so philosophical.

830
01:20:34,680 --> 01:20:36,591
At least
my brother's not my pimp.

831
01:20:39,280 --> 01:20:41,669
I had you pegged for a loser
the first time I saw you.

832
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:43,353
But you're worse.

833
01:20:44,360 --> 01:20:45,554
You're a coward.

834
01:20:56,040 --> 01:20:59,077
My name is Frank Baker

835
01:20:59,320 --> 01:21:01,993
and you know my brother Jack.

836
01:21:02,760 --> 01:21:06,389
My brother and I have been
playing together for...

837
01:21:08,240 --> 01:21:09,468
I don't know.

838
01:21:09,920 --> 01:21:10,989
Jack?

839
01:21:12,680 --> 01:21:13,795
31 years.

840
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:16,677
But of course, back then...

841
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:18,552
it was a little different.

842
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:24,069
We were just kids.

843
01:21:24,720 --> 01:21:27,951
The only one who'd listen to us
was the family cat, Cecil.

844
01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:33,918
We must've shaved
two lives off that cat, huh?

845
01:21:57,320 --> 01:21:58,389
Sorry.

846
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:06,631
We're not getting paid then.

847
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:09,473
I told you, it's a telethon.
No one gets a cent.

848
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:14,155
What's it for?

849
01:22:14,680 --> 01:22:16,238
I don't know, some disease.

850
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:18,198
What channel is it on?

851
01:22:19,720 --> 01:22:20,835
71.

852
01:22:25,120 --> 01:22:27,554
71? What is 71?

853
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:31,709
A channel, just a little further
down the dial. It's publicity.

854
01:22:31,880 --> 01:22:33,711
Publicity's publicity, right?

855
01:22:35,920 --> 01:22:36,909
Right.

856
01:22:50,080 --> 01:22:51,308
I'll see when we're on.

857
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:04,632
What's wrong with the kid.

858
01:23:04,920 --> 01:23:07,992
Tore his knee playing St Joseph's
just before the accident.

859
01:23:10,200 --> 01:23:11,189
Accident?

860
01:23:11,360 --> 01:23:12,679
The fire.

861
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:17,078
Rate we're going, we'll be lucky
to buy jockstraps, let alone a gym.

862
01:23:20,520 --> 01:23:21,748
Earl the pearl!

863
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:24,516
We're on after Mr. Basketball.

864
01:23:28,840 --> 01:23:30,956
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- What?

865
01:23:31,920 --> 01:23:33,638
We're playing for
a God damn gymnasium.

866
01:23:33,800 --> 01:23:35,518
Let's hear it for Jimmy Marshall.

867
01:23:36,920 --> 01:23:39,115
Most of you know
Jimmy twisted that knee

868
01:23:39,280 --> 01:23:41,316
trying to win one for
good old Lahuga High this year.

869
01:23:41,480 --> 01:23:44,472
Luckily, the doctors tell us that
Jimmy will play next season.

870
01:23:44,640 --> 01:23:46,949
That's where you come in.
Pick up the phone. Make a donation.

871
01:23:47,200 --> 01:23:50,954
Keep our kids off the street
and into the gym.

872
01:23:53,040 --> 01:23:54,029
All right!

873
01:23:54,200 --> 01:23:56,111
Get your fucking hands off me.

874
01:23:56,440 --> 01:23:58,556
We are pleased to have

875
01:23:58,720 --> 01:24:01,951
two of the most respected men
in the musical entertainment field.

876
01:24:02,400 --> 01:24:04,868
The Fabulous Bunker Boys!

877
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:06,268
Come on, you guys.

878
01:24:08,640 --> 01:24:10,039
Nice suits, fellas.

879
01:24:14,600 --> 01:24:18,070
A lot of amateur musicians
will wanna rap with these guys,

880
01:24:18,240 --> 01:24:21,949
and as soon as they're finished,
they'll be manning the phones.

881
01:24:22,720 --> 01:24:23,789
All right.

882
01:24:24,040 --> 01:24:26,235
What are we waiting for?
Take it away, guys.

883
01:24:44,760 --> 01:24:47,672
We know what that means.
Time to turn the big board over.

884
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:49,751
I'm afraid you guys
will have to wait a few minutes.

885
01:24:49,920 --> 01:24:50,830
Jack!

886
01:24:51,320 --> 01:24:54,118
I don't know about you,
but I sense electricity in the air.

887
01:24:55,400 --> 01:24:56,628
Alright, what do you think?

888
01:24:57,080 --> 01:24:58,672
Okay, let's do it.

889
01:25:02,440 --> 01:25:03,555
Play some music!

890
01:25:03,720 --> 01:25:05,153
Go fuck yourself, bud.

891
01:25:09,560 --> 01:25:11,630
Who the hell do you
think you are, Liberace?

892
01:25:15,800 --> 01:25:16,915
Are you okay?

893
01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:25,591
We just passed the car, Jack.

894
01:25:26,920 --> 01:25:28,911
Where the hell are you going?
You going to talk to me?

895
01:25:29,520 --> 01:25:31,636
Or is this
Jack's famous silent act?

896
01:25:32,520 --> 01:25:34,238
It was for publicity, understand?

897
01:25:34,400 --> 01:25:36,914
- Publicity!
- Are you a fucking moron?

898
01:25:38,160 --> 01:25:40,674
It's three in the morning.
Who's watching, paper boys?

899
01:25:41,200 --> 01:25:43,236
I didn't know when
we were on till yesterday.

900
01:25:43,400 --> 01:25:45,709
- Basketballs.
- Okay.

901
01:25:45,920 --> 01:25:47,797
You had us playing
for basketballs.

902
01:25:47,960 --> 01:25:51,669
I screwed up, but that
you don't walk out on a gig.

903
01:25:52,800 --> 01:25:53,789
What?

904
01:25:54,480 --> 01:25:56,038
It wasn't professional, Jack.

905
01:25:57,400 --> 01:26:01,393
What's happened to you?
Now you like kissing ass?

906
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:05,358
You let that guy
turn us into clowns tonight.

907
01:26:06,600 --> 01:26:09,068
We were always small time.
We were never clowns.

908
01:26:11,880 --> 01:26:12,869
What's happened to your dignity.

909
01:26:14,760 --> 01:26:17,752
Who the hell are you
to talk about dignity?

910
01:26:17,920 --> 01:26:19,592
This where you get your dignity?

911
01:26:19,800 --> 01:26:21,791
Let's do it straight for once.

912
01:26:23,520 --> 01:26:25,511
I want to explain something
to you, little brother.

913
01:26:26,680 --> 01:26:29,274
There are people in this world
who depend on me.

914
01:26:29,800 --> 01:26:32,712
I got a wife and kids
who expect to wake up

915
01:26:32,880 --> 01:26:35,269
with food on the table
and heat in the house.

916
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:38,000
I got a mortgage.
I got car payments.

917
01:26:38,160 --> 01:26:41,277
And I got you,
my little brother Jack.

918
01:26:41,560 --> 01:26:43,994
He's so hip, so cool and sure
that he's better than everyone.

919
01:26:44,160 --> 01:26:46,674
Don't you think I'd like to
walk up to one of those assholes

920
01:26:46,840 --> 01:26:48,114
and blow smoke in his face?

921
01:26:48,280 --> 01:26:49,872
God damn right I would!

922
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,992
But I can't.
I have to be responsible.

923
01:26:54,160 --> 01:26:56,958
I have to make the numbers
balance in my favor every month

924
01:26:57,120 --> 01:27:00,237
so everyone else can
go on living their lives.

925
01:27:01,880 --> 01:27:05,589
There's no medals but you'd notice
if I closed up shop.

926
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:10,118
Don't talk to me about dignity.
You're playing a weak hand.

927
01:27:11,440 --> 01:27:13,795
Terrific! Walk away.

928
01:27:14,440 --> 01:27:15,953
You're good at that, Jack.

929
01:27:16,200 --> 01:27:19,351
You never commit to anything.
Even a conversation.

930
01:27:20,120 --> 01:27:21,599
Is that what that was?

931
01:27:22,040 --> 01:27:23,712
Felt like a speech to me.

932
01:27:23,880 --> 01:27:26,189
Next time,
save it for the PTA.

933
01:27:26,440 --> 01:27:29,716
You couldn't keep
your cock in your pocket.

934
01:27:35,760 --> 01:27:37,034
Who I fuck...

935
01:27:37,800 --> 01:27:40,155
and who I don't fuck
is none of your fucking business.

936
01:27:40,320 --> 01:27:42,311
It is when it effects my business.

937
01:27:42,840 --> 01:27:45,115
- Your business?
- Yeah.

938
01:27:45,960 --> 01:27:48,190
It exists because of me.

939
01:27:48,880 --> 01:27:49,995
You?

940
01:27:52,640 --> 01:27:54,756
I make the calendar.
I pay the expenses.

941
01:27:54,920 --> 01:27:57,229
Christ, I even make sure
your shoes are shined.

942
01:27:57,520 --> 01:27:58,794
What do you do?

943
01:27:58,960 --> 01:28:00,996
You show up for a couple of hours
a night and smoke cigarettes.

944
01:28:01,320 --> 01:28:04,232
If somebody requested "Chopsticks"
you'd ask for the sheet music.

945
01:28:04,400 --> 01:28:08,188
If not for me, you'd be playing
for dimes from the back of a truck.

946
01:28:08,680 --> 01:28:10,238
Yeah, you're a real pro, Frank.

947
01:28:11,040 --> 01:28:13,156
You did a bang up job:

948
01:28:13,320 --> 01:28:15,914
You had them paying us
not to play!

949
01:28:16,280 --> 01:28:17,599
That's fucking genius.

950
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:22,433
Asshole, what are you doing?

951
01:28:23,400 --> 01:28:24,799
What the fuck are you doing?

952
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:27,915
That is it!

953
01:28:28,640 --> 01:28:30,073
Jack!

954
01:28:39,600 --> 01:28:42,273
Fucking little brother
beat the shit out of you, huh?

955
01:28:42,920 --> 01:28:44,399
Jack, my hand!

956
01:28:51,760 --> 01:28:53,876
I'm through.
I can't do it anymore.

957
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:25,909
You're one of those
Fabulous guys.

958
01:29:26,320 --> 01:29:28,709
- I remember.
- I don't remember.

959
01:29:29,240 --> 01:29:32,915
You can't kid me.
I see you here every night.

960
01:29:33,400 --> 01:29:35,868
That's why I took the job.

961
01:29:36,040 --> 01:29:39,476
I come in, I see you and
your brother's faces hanging there,

962
01:29:40,200 --> 01:29:42,191
I figured it was a sign.

963
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:44,558
Like destiny.

964
01:29:47,920 --> 01:29:49,273
How are you doing, Monica?

965
01:29:49,520 --> 01:29:52,478
Well, only it's Blanche here.

966
01:29:52,920 --> 01:29:54,069
Don't touch that.

967
01:29:55,280 --> 01:29:57,077
That's three hours cold.

968
01:29:58,720 --> 01:30:02,998
I've been standing over here
waiting for you to wake up.

969
01:30:03,640 --> 01:30:07,952
Finally I figured maybe
you had an appointment.

970
01:30:08,720 --> 01:30:09,709
Here you go.

971
01:30:11,960 --> 01:30:13,234
Boy, it's weird, huh?

972
01:30:13,400 --> 01:30:17,154
You meet someone, think you'll
never see them again...

973
01:30:22,480 --> 01:30:25,119
Guess you got
caught in the rain, huh?

974
01:30:26,920 --> 01:30:28,717
Yeah, I got caught in the rain.

975
01:30:32,120 --> 01:30:33,348
What time do you punch out?

976
01:30:35,040 --> 01:30:36,029
What?

977
01:30:37,560 --> 01:30:38,993
What time do you punch out?

978
01:30:43,240 --> 01:30:44,958
You're my last ticket.

979
01:30:54,720 --> 01:30:56,711
Button up on the way home, Blanche.

980
01:30:59,080 --> 01:31:00,433
It's cold out there.

981
01:31:18,440 --> 01:31:19,475
Hi, Jack.

982
01:31:20,120 --> 01:31:21,553
I took Eddie out.

983
01:31:29,200 --> 01:31:32,715
Be sure to take that tux in.
I can drop it off this afternoon.

984
01:31:34,720 --> 01:31:36,392
Will you stop that, please?

985
01:31:37,400 --> 01:31:38,958
Want me to make some coffee?

986
01:31:39,880 --> 01:31:42,189
How about I make some eggs?

987
01:31:45,160 --> 01:31:47,515
Knock if off with that thing.

988
01:31:47,680 --> 01:31:49,079
You're driving me nuts.

989
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:51,956
Jack, you want eggs?
Jack, you want coffee?

990
01:31:52,120 --> 01:31:56,193
I can't baby-sit you every time
your mama gets an itch.

991
01:32:11,760 --> 01:32:12,909
What are you looking at?

992
01:32:50,880 --> 01:32:52,677
You're having a bad day, right?

993
01:32:56,200 --> 01:32:57,189
Right.

994
01:32:59,000 --> 01:32:59,989
It's okay.

995
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:04,151
My mom had a lot of those.
Sometimes that's why I came down.

996
01:33:20,520 --> 01:33:21,714
What do you say...

997
01:33:22,840 --> 01:33:25,434
we go over to the Empire
and grab a couple of Coneys?

998
01:33:26,240 --> 01:33:28,470
I can't. I'm going to
the zoo with Howard.

999
01:33:29,480 --> 01:33:30,469
Howard?

1000
01:33:31,320 --> 01:33:33,834
Mom says I can't call him
Bigfoot anymore.

1001
01:33:40,960 --> 01:33:42,393
I think he's early.

1002
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:00,669
Teach you later?

1003
01:34:03,120 --> 01:34:06,317
You gonna play "Jingle Bells"
the rest of your life?

1004
01:35:19,440 --> 01:35:21,954
I have Tuesdays
and Thursdays open.

1005
01:35:23,720 --> 01:35:25,278
They're yours if you want them.

1006
01:35:58,600 --> 01:36:00,750
- Everything goes. That the idea?
- No...

1007
01:36:00,920 --> 01:36:03,195
I'm just getting too old
for trophy dens.

1008
01:36:03,360 --> 01:36:05,555
Anyway, it's a good place
for a workshop.

1009
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:07,149
Workshop?

1010
01:36:08,560 --> 01:36:09,959
Yeah, workshop.

1011
01:36:10,840 --> 01:36:13,434
Hammers and saws and...

1012
01:36:14,360 --> 01:36:16,715
...things like that.
- Let's cut the bullshit.

1013
01:36:16,880 --> 01:36:18,359
You came here
to talk business, right?

1014
01:36:19,080 --> 01:36:20,911
We'll put the other night behind us.

1015
01:36:21,080 --> 01:36:24,117
In a couple of weeks,
it'll be the same. Now you can go.

1016
01:36:27,760 --> 01:36:29,398
I'm not coming back, Frank.

1017
01:36:34,760 --> 01:36:36,751
Then what's there to talk about?

1018
01:36:39,920 --> 01:36:40,796
Frank.

1019
01:36:43,040 --> 01:36:44,075
Listen.

1020
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:47,878
It's not you, understand?
It's me.

1021
01:36:54,880 --> 01:36:58,998
I sit in the fucking Hilton
or the Sheraton

1022
01:36:59,240 --> 01:37:00,878
practically every night of my life.

1023
01:37:01,040 --> 01:37:03,998
And the moment I get on stage,
I can't wait for it to end.

1024
01:37:05,400 --> 01:37:09,154
We play the same songs
the same way every night.

1025
01:37:10,480 --> 01:37:12,152
I just can't do it anymore.

1026
01:37:15,120 --> 01:37:17,475
I've been lying
to myself long enough.

1027
01:37:22,680 --> 01:37:24,238
You see anything you want, take it.

1028
01:37:43,400 --> 01:37:44,753
Okay if I take this?

1029
01:37:52,280 --> 01:37:54,191
Come on, Frank. I'm trying.

1030
01:37:58,640 --> 01:37:59,709
How's your hand?

1031
01:37:59,880 --> 01:38:03,316
My hand is fine.
Don't worry about me.

1032
01:38:03,480 --> 01:38:05,311
I don't need this any more than you.

1033
01:38:06,600 --> 01:38:09,034
I can make just as much
teaching "Camptown Races"

1034
01:38:09,200 --> 01:38:11,350
to snotty kids in the neighborhood.

1035
01:38:14,640 --> 01:38:16,039
Don't fool yourself.

1036
01:38:32,400 --> 01:38:33,435
Open it.

1037
01:38:36,720 --> 01:38:38,517
Open the fucking bottle.

1038
01:38:44,960 --> 01:38:46,632
Let's see what we got here.

1039
01:38:46,800 --> 01:38:48,756
We got the airport Ramada.

1040
01:38:51,120 --> 01:38:52,997
The Travel Lodge on 410.

1041
01:38:54,440 --> 01:38:55,873
And we got...

1042
01:38:58,400 --> 01:38:59,549
the Mallory.

1043
01:38:59,760 --> 01:39:01,239
I'll take the Mallory.

1044
01:39:01,400 --> 01:39:03,868
Forget it. I want the Mallory.
You take the Travel Lodge.

1045
01:39:31,640 --> 01:39:32,914
Not bad!

1046
01:39:39,600 --> 01:39:41,909
When was the last time
we played the Mallory?

1047
01:39:42,120 --> 01:39:43,838
'78, November.

1048
01:39:45,400 --> 01:39:48,676
It was someone's birthday.
Hallorin?

1049
01:39:49,760 --> 01:39:51,432
His daughter, sweet sixteen.

1050
01:39:52,040 --> 01:39:53,758
How could I forget?

1051
01:39:54,080 --> 01:39:55,559
What a nightmare.

1052
01:39:55,880 --> 01:39:57,199
She asked for it.

1053
01:39:57,360 --> 01:39:59,271
I told Howard we didn't
do vocals and he said:

1054
01:39:59,440 --> 01:40:01,078
"What my Sissie wants,

1055
01:40:01,640 --> 01:40:03,437
my Sissie gets".

1056
01:40:10,080 --> 01:40:11,399
She got it alright.

1057
01:41:12,280 --> 01:41:14,077
You're risking your life.

1058
01:41:15,640 --> 01:41:16,789
You got a gun?

1059
01:41:17,520 --> 01:41:20,398
Car you're leaning on belongs to
a light heavyweight with attitude.

1060
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:23,433
I'll take my chances.

1061
01:41:29,600 --> 01:41:30,669
You look good.

1062
01:41:31,680 --> 01:41:33,238
You look like shit.

1063
01:41:38,440 --> 01:41:40,032
No, I mean it. You look good.

1064
01:41:43,160 --> 01:41:45,310
I mean it, too.
You look like shit.

1065
01:41:48,040 --> 01:41:49,712
So how's the cat food business?

1066
01:41:52,440 --> 01:41:55,159
Terrific.
I'm doing vegetables now.

1067
01:41:57,280 --> 01:41:58,554
What kind?

1068
01:41:58,760 --> 01:41:59,749
Carrots,

1069
01:42:00,480 --> 01:42:01,674
peas.

1070
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:05,158
None of the important ones.

1071
01:42:09,760 --> 01:42:11,079
You know...

1072
01:42:12,360 --> 01:42:13,475
the other night...

1073
01:42:14,440 --> 01:42:15,793
I was out of line.

1074
01:42:15,960 --> 01:42:17,439
No, I was out of line.

1075
01:42:24,280 --> 01:42:25,349
Well...

1076
01:42:26,600 --> 01:42:28,670
I was kind of rough on Egghead.

1077
01:42:31,360 --> 01:42:33,555
It beats the hell out of me,
but I kind of miss him.

1078
01:42:34,520 --> 01:42:35,669
Well...

1079
01:42:39,280 --> 01:42:42,272
he grows on you,
after a while.

1080
01:42:45,280 --> 01:42:46,998
So, did you find another girl?

1081
01:42:49,280 --> 01:42:50,508
I didn't look.

1082
01:42:57,960 --> 01:42:58,949
Well...

1083
01:42:59,360 --> 01:43:00,679
I'm going to be late.

1084
01:43:02,440 --> 01:43:05,398
<i>Peas, peas,</i>
<i>Try our peas.</i>

1085
01:43:05,560 --> 01:43:08,154
<i>Our peas are a delicacy.</i>

1086
01:43:10,600 --> 01:43:12,795
From "Strangers in the Night"
to that.

1087
01:43:13,240 --> 01:43:14,673
Funny world.

1088
01:43:20,960 --> 01:43:22,359
Well... bye, Baker.

1089
01:43:32,200 --> 01:43:33,553
Am I going to see you again?

1090
01:43:34,720 --> 01:43:35,914
What do you think?

1091
01:43:38,080 --> 01:43:39,069
Yeah,

1092
01:43:39,880 --> 01:43:41,871
I think I am going to see you again.

1093
01:43:47,320 --> 01:43:48,594
Intuition.
