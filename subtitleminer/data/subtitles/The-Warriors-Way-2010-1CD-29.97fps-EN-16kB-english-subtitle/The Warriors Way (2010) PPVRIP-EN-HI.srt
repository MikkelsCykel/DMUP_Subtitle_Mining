00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:18,000
THE WARRIOR'S WAY (2010)

2
00:00:18,529 --> 00:00:20,920
(male narrator) Okay.
Settle down.

3
00:00:21,003 --> 00:00:22,733
Got your ears open?

4
00:00:24,342 --> 00:00:26,321
(clears throat)

5
00:00:26,404 --> 00:00:29,494
This is the story of a sad flute

6
00:00:29,578 --> 00:00:32,423
a laughin' baby
and a weepin' sword.

7
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:45,822
A long, long time ago
in a land far, far away,

8
00:00:45,905 --> 00:00:48,502
there lived a warrior...

9
00:00:48,585 --> 00:00:51,182
warrior with empty eyes.

10
00:02:26,257 --> 00:02:29,555
He'd trained his entire life
for one purpose.

11
00:02:32,113 --> 00:02:35,947
To be the greatest swordsman
in the history of mankind.

12
00:03:20,598 --> 00:03:23,483
He'd just achieved
his life's ambition,

13
00:03:23,567 --> 00:03:26,245
but his heart felt emptier
than ever.

14
00:03:29,504 --> 00:03:33,338
These two clans had been warrin'
for 500 years.

15
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:36,347
And they vowed to keep on warrin'
until one of them

16
00:03:36,431 --> 00:03:38,822
didn't have a single man
left above Styx.

17
00:03:51,645 --> 00:03:53,293
(giggles)

18
00:03:59,683 --> 00:04:01,950
(coos, cries)

19
00:04:07,106 --> 00:04:09,372
(coos, giggles)

20
00:04:09,455 --> 00:04:11,228
And so now, here he was,

21
00:04:11,311 --> 00:04:14,236
peerin' down
at this very last of his enemy.

22
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,051
(baby coos, laughs)

23
00:04:24,505 --> 00:04:27,637
When that
little warrior princess giggled,

24
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,780
it did somethin' to him inside.

25
00:04:32,213 --> 00:04:33,945
But this was no time for feelin'.

26
00:05:03,467 --> 00:05:05,732
For when spared that baby's life,

27
00:05:05,815 --> 00:05:09,732
he put his name at the top
of his own clan's death list.

28
00:06:09,515 --> 00:06:13,720
With nothin' but the clothes on his back
and the baby in his arms,

29
00:06:13,804 --> 00:06:19,080
he decided to pay a visit to an old
warrior friend in a faraway land.

30
00:07:51,393 --> 00:07:52,794
Hey, Johnny.

31
00:07:54,404 --> 00:07:57,082
I don't like your stinkin' face.

32
00:07:57,165 --> 00:07:59,144
Easy, Ronald.

33
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:02,772
The name's Eight-Ball.
Like in the game.

34
00:08:02,854 --> 00:08:05,080
Good luck for some,
bad luck for others.

35
00:08:05,164 --> 00:08:08,750
How can I assist you,
my friend from the mystical East?

36
00:08:12,338 --> 00:08:13,987
Uh-oh.

37
00:08:18,482 --> 00:08:20,666
Haven't been here
since Smiley kicked the bucket.

38
00:08:22,274 --> 00:08:25,036
Was a 3-day wait
just to get your shirts pressed.

39
00:08:30,025 --> 00:08:31,385
(laughs)

40
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:34,685
For a guy who cleaned sheets all day,
he sure liked to make a mess

41
00:08:34,768 --> 00:08:37,240
in the after-hours,
if you know what I mean.

42
00:08:39,137 --> 00:08:40,209
See you in the morning.

43
00:08:59,464 --> 00:09:01,978
(man) You came to me
to be strong.

44
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,285
I have made you the strongest.

45
00:09:12,244 --> 00:09:15,830
She will always be the enemy.

46
00:09:27,787 --> 00:09:29,849
(baby crying in distance)

47
00:09:56,444 --> 00:09:58,957
(bellows)

48
00:10:06,874 --> 00:10:08,440
Here it is.

49
00:10:08,523 --> 00:10:10,543
Just rub some on your shoulder.

50
00:10:11,449 --> 00:10:14,418
Smiley's Oriental cure-all.
Works like a charm.

51
00:10:14,502 --> 00:10:15,530
(crying)

52
00:10:15,614 --> 00:10:17,345
Now, honey,
I didn't forget about you.

53
00:10:18,913 --> 00:10:22,582
It's alright there. It's okay.
Ssh, ssh, ssh.

54
00:10:22,665 --> 00:10:26,911
Sorry about the tap I gave ya.
I thought you knew the sword.

55
00:10:26,994 --> 00:10:31,939
Smiley was always yabberin' on about
a guy who was gonna roll into town.

56
00:10:32,023 --> 00:10:36,557
But I shoulda figgered.
What do you call her?

57
00:10:36,641 --> 00:10:38,248
I do not know.

58
00:10:38,331 --> 00:10:40,640
Oh. She's not yours?

59
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:42,785
Where's her folks?

60
00:10:42,867 --> 00:10:44,844
Dead.

61
00:10:54,906 --> 00:10:58,162
Oo-ee, best we find you
another diaper.

62
00:10:58,244 --> 00:10:59,481
Alright.

63
00:11:01,752 --> 00:11:04,057
Smiley like
your uncle or something?

64
00:11:04,141 --> 00:11:05,871
Friend.

65
00:11:05,955 --> 00:11:09,211
Well, if you were his friend,
maybe he would like for you

66
00:11:09,337 --> 00:11:10,573
to take over his laundry.

67
00:11:10,657 --> 00:11:14,365
- Do not know how.
- So I'll teach ya.

68
00:11:14,449 --> 00:11:16,386
I always done the laundry
around here.

69
00:11:16,469 --> 00:11:18,900
That's how I repaid Smiley
for teaching me the sword.

70
00:11:18,984 --> 00:11:21,663
Tell you what I'm gonna do.

71
00:11:21,746 --> 00:11:24,921
You stay here, I'll teach you how
to tie a diaper properly.

72
00:11:25,004 --> 00:11:28,218
We'll be partners, 60:40.
You are the 40.

73
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:31,476
Alright now,
time to get to work.

74
00:11:34,733 --> 00:11:38,073
Dang, you're slower
than molasses in January.

75
00:11:43,392 --> 00:11:45,453
(fly buzzing)

76
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:06,809
You clean that real good,
yellow boy.

77
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:09,035
As clean
as Snow White's panties...

78
00:12:09,118 --> 00:12:14,066
If I find the smallest bit
of condor crap on my fancy duds...

79
00:12:14,149 --> 00:12:18,643
- Well, we gonna have us...
- (crunch)

80
00:12:18,726 --> 00:12:21,734
Didn't I tell you I'd rip 'em off
if you don't watch yourself?

81
00:12:21,817 --> 00:12:22,847
Let go, evil midget!

82
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:25,239
Come on, Eight-Ball,
we were just havin' us some fun.

83
00:12:25,322 --> 00:12:27,548
- Really?
- Ah! (grunts)

84
00:12:27,631 --> 00:12:31,094
Okay... okay...
Let go.

85
00:12:31,178 --> 00:12:33,691
- (laughs)
- Get outta here!

86
00:12:38,308 --> 00:12:40,741
How 'bout a home-cooked meal
for you and your little 'un?

87
00:12:44,946 --> 00:12:49,235
Once that Ferris wheel is finished,
it's gonna bring everybody rushin' back,

88
00:12:49,319 --> 00:12:52,822
And then we can take the word
"travelling" out of "travelling circus."

89
00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:54,512
Hey, Ron.

90
00:12:54,595 --> 00:12:58,305
(slurring) Welcome to the
Eighth Wonder ofthe World!

91
00:12:58,388 --> 00:13:00,655
Get down here!
The chow bell ringin'!

92
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:08,366
Ha!

93
00:13:48,812 --> 00:13:50,626
(light applause)

94
00:13:50,709 --> 00:13:53,223
(woman) Bravo, bravo.

95
00:13:58,831 --> 00:14:00,726
(laughs, applause)

96
00:14:04,438 --> 00:14:06,499
Gonna grab some vittles with us?

97
00:14:06,582 --> 00:14:08,806
No thanks.
Not hungry.

98
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:12,560
I-I-I b-baked a cake.

99
00:14:15,528 --> 00:14:17,920
Come on, Ron!

100
00:14:18,003 --> 00:14:20,804
What the hell's up with her?

101
00:14:27,733 --> 00:14:31,607
You, I knew you was trouble the moment
you walked into this...

102
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:33,668
(gurgles)

103
00:14:37,463 --> 00:14:40,059
(snores, laughter)

104
00:14:45,915 --> 00:14:48,841
(woman singing operatically)

105
00:15:14,693 --> 00:15:16,755
(squeals)

106
00:15:33,493 --> 00:15:35,678
Sounds even better from inside.

107
00:15:37,905 --> 00:15:40,955
(singing continues)

108
00:15:44,419 --> 00:15:47,099
You ever seen
one ofthese before?

109
00:15:49,078 --> 00:15:53,200
The sound it's makin'?
It's called "opera."

110
00:15:53,283 --> 00:15:56,828
Day my poppa found his first chunk
of gold,

111
00:15:56,953 --> 00:15:59,262
he went out and bought this thing.

112
00:16:04,787 --> 00:16:07,178
Listen.
Here's my favorite part.

113
00:16:42,305 --> 00:16:46,675
(narrator) So at the edge of the desert,
in a busted town full of broken people,

114
00:16:46,759 --> 00:16:52,572
the warrior began to learn stuff
he shoulda learned a long time ago.

115
00:16:52,655 --> 00:16:54,549
(squishing)

116
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:06,341
No, no! Rough!

117
00:17:08,982 --> 00:17:11,577
Like the joy
of gettin' dirty things clean.

118
00:17:17,558 --> 00:17:19,701
(laughs)

119
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:25,802
Yes!

120
00:17:29,844 --> 00:17:32,480
Woo hoo! That's me!
(laughs) Thank you!

121
00:17:32,564 --> 00:17:35,202
I told you to aim at the line,
not at the coin!

122
00:17:35,286 --> 00:17:36,357
All right! (laughs)

123
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:39,448
He also learned the joy of losing.

124
00:17:39,532 --> 00:17:42,830
You're gonna need blood and bone of
about 100 dead buffaloes as fertilizer.

125
00:17:42,914 --> 00:17:45,181
Smiley always tried
to get something to grow.

126
00:17:45,264 --> 00:17:46,911
Never, ever lasted too long.

127
00:17:52,148 --> 00:17:54,992
He learned you could be happy
workin' with folks.

128
00:17:57,632 --> 00:18:00,558
And findin' the simple peace
in some private time

129
00:18:00,641 --> 00:18:03,031
after a hard day's work.

130
00:18:03,115 --> 00:18:04,764
(door bell chimes)

131
00:18:04,847 --> 00:18:06,289
What's takin' you so long?

132
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:23,152
Come on, Skinny!
You gonna miss it. Come on.

133
00:18:24,966 --> 00:18:27,028
(door bell chimes, door closes)

134
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:35,274
(train whistle blows)

135
00:18:35,358 --> 00:18:38,819
And he found that it's nice
to have a few friends around

136
00:18:38,903 --> 00:18:40,798
when the sun goes down.

137
00:18:48,304 --> 00:18:52,219
But most of all, the warrior learned
there's a heck of a lot more pleasure

138
00:18:52,303 --> 00:18:56,341
makin' things grow
than there is in cuttin' 'em down.

139
00:19:04,052 --> 00:19:06,444
(laughter)

140
00:19:06,527 --> 00:19:08,752
You bunch of pups!
Gimme back that goddamn bottle!

141
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,368
You win.
Show me what you got.

142
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:27,512
God damn!
I shoulda never taught you this game!

143
00:19:27,595 --> 00:19:29,573
You a shark with a poker face.

144
00:19:52,292 --> 00:19:53,651
What happened to her?

145
00:20:18,431 --> 00:20:22,263
(woman whimpers) Please!
Help me!

146
00:20:22,347 --> 00:20:24,202
- Help me!
- Lynne!

147
00:20:24,285 --> 00:20:27,500
- Please! Let her go!
- Someone, help me!

148
00:20:27,584 --> 00:20:30,387
- Eight-Ball!
- Lynne!!

149
00:20:41,684 --> 00:20:42,796
(man) Hungry?

150
00:20:45,146 --> 00:20:46,341
No?

151
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:16,028
Pretty thing.

152
00:21:42,868 --> 00:21:44,723
Aagh!

153
00:21:44,806 --> 00:21:46,867
Agh! Aah!

154
00:21:52,475 --> 00:21:54,288
Damn you!

155
00:22:15,109 --> 00:22:16,428
(pistol cocks)

156
00:22:22,036 --> 00:22:25,128
Noooo!

157
00:22:25,212 --> 00:22:28,219
(grunting, crowd murmuring)

158
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:33,704
No! Lynne! Lynne!

159
00:22:39,559 --> 00:22:40,836
Agh!

160
00:22:47,682 --> 00:22:49,742
No!!

161
00:22:54,402 --> 00:22:56,009
(woman sobs, gunshots)

162
00:22:56,092 --> 00:22:57,493
No!!

163
00:23:17,285 --> 00:23:19,962
Only thing was,
when we went to bury her,

164
00:23:20,046 --> 00:23:21,448
she was still breathing.

165
00:23:22,686 --> 00:23:25,074
Never known nobody
that close to kickin' it.

166
00:23:26,808 --> 00:23:32,042
We didn't know what to do wit' her,
if'n she was gonna live or die.

167
00:23:32,125 --> 00:23:35,590
So we just put her in bed
and waited.

168
00:23:35,673 --> 00:23:38,475
Two days,
and she was eating soup.

169
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:41,608
By the day three, she was already
sitting up somehow

170
00:23:41,692 --> 00:23:43,712
and slinging daggers
at the wall.

171
00:23:45,691 --> 00:23:46,844
But God ain't fair.

172
00:23:46,927 --> 00:23:50,226
And some people
just ain't cut out for the knife.

173
00:24:09,893 --> 00:24:13,809
Dang it.
My arm ain't worth a damn.

174
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:17,519
It is not your arm.

175
00:24:24,447 --> 00:24:26,548
What'd you say?

176
00:24:26,633 --> 00:24:28,280
Ouch!

177
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:32,527
Now you sure about this?

178
00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:35,288
'Cause I'm not so good
with my eyes open.

179
00:24:35,373 --> 00:24:37,267
Throw.

180
00:24:44,237 --> 00:24:45,721
I can't do it.

181
00:24:45,804 --> 00:24:48,607
Do not talk. Focus.

182
00:24:48,691 --> 00:24:50,874
It is your heart that shakes.

183
00:25:04,562 --> 00:25:05,882
You dead?

184
00:25:05,965 --> 00:25:07,161
Not yet.

185
00:25:28,146 --> 00:25:30,743
Sure you're not fountainin' blood
or anything, are ya?

186
00:25:33,877 --> 00:25:35,154
Oh, shit!

187
00:25:46,946 --> 00:25:49,791
(laughs) Ha!

188
00:25:49,875 --> 00:25:51,152
I did it!

189
00:25:53,956 --> 00:25:55,935
Thank you,
Mr. Sad Flute.

190
00:25:58,616 --> 00:26:00,551
Smiley told me everything.

191
00:26:00,635 --> 00:26:02,655
I just taught you to focus.

192
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:17,168
Why you do that?

193
00:26:59,923 --> 00:27:03,138
Okay.
I've always been dyin' to know.

194
00:27:03,222 --> 00:27:05,158
Why are y'all called
The Sad Flutes?

195
00:27:10,066 --> 00:27:13,157
So you got lady Sad Flutes,
too?

196
00:27:13,241 --> 00:27:15,508
Sad Flutinas or somethin'?

197
00:27:17,693 --> 00:27:19,341
Yes.

198
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:22,516
Wow! That's nice.

199
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:25,979
Jumpin' in the moonlight and kissin'

200
00:27:26,062 --> 00:27:30,103
as you both fly under the stars
to the tunes of The Sad Flutes...

201
00:27:30,186 --> 00:27:35,709
We are called Sad Flutes
because when you cut the throat,

202
00:27:35,792 --> 00:27:39,131
the last sound is like a sad flute.

203
00:27:41,194 --> 00:27:42,347
Dang!

204
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:46,552
Skinny, sure know how to throw
a dead cat into a party room, don't ya?

205
00:27:52,285 --> 00:27:54,179
Why'd you become a Sad Flute?

206
00:27:57,893 --> 00:27:59,747
To be strong.

207
00:27:59,829 --> 00:28:01,023
That it?

208
00:28:07,332 --> 00:28:10,796
My father was working in the field.

209
00:28:10,879 --> 00:28:12,364
I was helping him.

210
00:28:14,424 --> 00:28:17,269
A swordsman came.

211
00:28:17,352 --> 00:28:18,919
Killed my father.

212
00:28:19,002 --> 00:28:22,216
Just to test his sword.

213
00:28:24,115 --> 00:28:26,340
That musta hurt you
somethin' bad.

214
00:28:26,423 --> 00:28:30,421
Not hurt. Angry.

215
00:28:30,504 --> 00:28:32,606
Course.

216
00:28:32,689 --> 00:28:34,586
No.

217
00:28:34,669 --> 00:28:38,585
I was angry at my father.

218
00:28:55,037 --> 00:28:58,704
Here. Take it.

219
00:28:58,787 --> 00:29:02,745
It's a present.
My momma gave it to me.

220
00:29:02,829 --> 00:29:07,568
She said, "If you hold it
over your heart when you're sad,

221
00:29:07,653 --> 00:29:09,879
it takes away all your sadness."

222
00:29:11,321 --> 00:29:14,124
It works.

223
00:29:14,208 --> 00:29:15,650
Kinda.

224
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:19,608
Present?

225
00:29:19,691 --> 00:29:21,422
Yeah.

226
00:29:26,165 --> 00:29:28,225
(footsteps approaching)

227
00:29:33,792 --> 00:29:36,265
(whimpers)

228
00:29:36,349 --> 00:29:38,903
(dog yips)

229
00:29:43,976 --> 00:29:46,531
That is your only friend here.

230
00:29:46,614 --> 00:29:48,592
Take good care of it.

231
00:29:48,675 --> 00:29:50,201
Yes, master.

232
00:29:58,158 --> 00:29:59,642
Oh, tarnations.

233
00:29:59,724 --> 00:30:02,198
Only to protect,
not kill.

234
00:30:02,281 --> 00:30:04,425
What am I gonna kill in this town,
an armadillo?

235
00:30:06,363 --> 00:30:08,012
Is that what I think it is?

236
00:30:24,751 --> 00:30:27,018
You've sealed it.

237
00:30:27,102 --> 00:30:29,327
So they cannot hear.

238
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:31,595
Hear what?

239
00:30:31,678 --> 00:30:33,039
The weeping.

240
00:30:35,099 --> 00:30:38,851
Of all the souls I have taken.

241
00:30:42,357 --> 00:30:43,469
Who's listenin'?

242
00:30:43,552 --> 00:30:47,015
My past.

243
00:30:47,098 --> 00:30:48,622
And if it hears?

244
00:30:51,014 --> 00:30:52,664
No more music.

245
00:31:03,425 --> 00:31:05,898
This is a big country.
Where do we look?

246
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:10,845
Do not look.

247
00:31:10,929 --> 00:31:13,648
We listen.

248
00:31:13,732 --> 00:31:15,299
He will show.

249
00:31:52,858 --> 00:31:55,580
Think ofthe sword
as part of the body.

250
00:31:56,405 --> 00:31:59,001
Like a finger.
Like a tooth.

251
00:31:59,085 --> 00:32:03,331
Rather think of it like metal
slicin' through a herd of buffalo!

252
00:32:10,052 --> 00:32:12,030
Show me what Smiley taught you.

253
00:32:23,203 --> 00:32:25,429
You do not have the power.

254
00:32:25,513 --> 00:32:28,645
Well, thank you very much.
I did not know that.

255
00:32:28,728 --> 00:32:30,212
But you are fast.

256
00:32:30,295 --> 00:32:32,809
Just have to be faster.

257
00:32:34,832 --> 00:32:36,148
Ouch!

258
00:32:37,221 --> 00:32:41,468
Ouch! Is this 'cause of yesterday?
'Cause I said I was sorry!

259
00:32:41,551 --> 00:32:43,817
What? Cut it out, Skinny.
I'm serious!

260
00:32:43,901 --> 00:32:47,116
You are slower than molasses
in January.

261
00:32:47,241 --> 00:32:48,271
(laughs) Come on, then!

262
00:32:48,354 --> 00:32:51,982
Ah! (laughs) Ouch!

263
00:32:52,065 --> 00:32:53,796
Cut it out, Skinny!

264
00:32:55,857 --> 00:32:57,465
Ow! (laughs)

265
00:32:57,548 --> 00:32:59,815
Stop it, Skinny!
(laughs)

266
00:32:59,899 --> 00:33:02,206
Cut it out!
I'm serious!

267
00:33:02,290 --> 00:33:05,504
(laughs) Stop!

268
00:33:13,793 --> 00:33:15,853
(laughter)

269
00:33:17,832 --> 00:33:20,223
(speaking Spanish)

270
00:33:27,028 --> 00:33:28,716
(man) You bearded nut!

271
00:34:20,585 --> 00:34:22,521
Merry Christmas,
Laundry Man!

272
00:34:22,605 --> 00:34:24,707
(crowd) Merry Christmas!

273
00:34:24,789 --> 00:34:26,851
(crowd cheers)
Merry Christmas.

274
00:34:34,603 --> 00:34:35,632
Yeah!

275
00:34:35,716 --> 00:34:37,652
(cheers and applause)

276
00:34:37,736 --> 00:34:40,662
(laughs)

277
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:42,970
(lively music plays)

278
00:34:47,425 --> 00:34:48,538
We go!

279
00:34:48,622 --> 00:34:50,638
(laughter and scattered cheers)

280
00:34:57,978 --> 00:34:59,545
May I have this dance?

281
00:35:02,804 --> 00:35:04,615
(crowd clapping rhythmically)

282
00:35:04,699 --> 00:35:07,007
Whose birthday?

283
00:35:07,092 --> 00:35:10,017
Well...
It's sort of a long story.

284
00:35:28,119 --> 00:35:30,261
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

285
00:35:31,375 --> 00:35:33,106
Hey, ya young punks!

286
00:35:44,446 --> 00:35:47,537
Ya gonna take me for a spin
or what?

287
00:35:51,042 --> 00:35:52,730
(metal clanging)

288
00:36:35,528 --> 00:36:36,970
I win.

289
00:36:37,053 --> 00:36:38,620
No.

290
00:36:38,704 --> 00:36:44,433
Until your enemy's heart stops,
you have not won.

291
00:36:47,073 --> 00:36:48,433
Is that so?

292
00:37:16,593 --> 00:37:18,199
Did that stop your heart?

293
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,294
(horse whinnies)

294
00:38:30,022 --> 00:38:32,950
(record skipping)

295
00:38:38,268 --> 00:38:39,917
("Silent Night" plays)

296
00:38:40,001 --> 00:38:43,008
Ha! That's better!

297
00:38:43,092 --> 00:38:45,359
(chuckles)

298
00:38:50,678 --> 00:38:53,276
Merry Christmas!

299
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:56,572
I didn't get my invitation.

300
00:38:57,936 --> 00:38:59,955
Has anyone seen it?

301
00:39:00,038 --> 00:39:03,747
No? Huh.

302
00:39:03,830 --> 00:39:06,757
Never mind.

303
00:39:08,985 --> 00:39:11,087
We're all here now.

304
00:39:12,531 --> 00:39:14,344
No harm done.

305
00:39:16,695 --> 00:39:19,208
Ho, ho, ho.

306
00:39:26,465 --> 00:39:31,165
And what did Santa bring you,
little boy? Huh?

307
00:39:33,185 --> 00:39:36,484
Why...
if it ain't a clown.

308
00:39:39,906 --> 00:39:43,040
You're looking so sad.
Huh.

309
00:39:47,410 --> 00:39:50,996
You know, I never found clowns
that funny myself.

310
00:39:52,975 --> 00:39:55,037
(gunshots,
men whooping and laughing)

311
00:40:27,691 --> 00:40:31,608
Don't worry, clown.
I'm a pretty good shot.

312
00:40:31,692 --> 00:40:33,834
Especially
when I've been drinking.

313
00:40:39,236 --> 00:40:41,049
(bottle clatters)

314
00:40:44,306 --> 00:40:45,873
Hey!

315
00:40:47,936 --> 00:40:51,232
Don't go wastin'
good moonshine.

316
00:40:53,667 --> 00:40:57,830
Wow.
This shit's smoother'n a calf's ass.

317
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:03,271
But this...
this party's for girls.

318
00:41:03,355 --> 00:41:05,951
Let's all go to the spilloon!

319
00:41:06,035 --> 00:41:07,849
What have we here?

320
00:41:09,416 --> 00:41:11,559
Looks like we got ourselves
another clown.

321
00:41:14,816 --> 00:41:16,836
Take this clown for a walk.

322
00:41:18,774 --> 00:41:21,082
(men cheer)

323
00:41:25,866 --> 00:41:27,927
(choking and sputtering)

324
00:41:34,442 --> 00:41:36,503
(laughter and whooping)

325
00:41:41,658 --> 00:41:43,636
(needle scratches,
crowd gasps)

326
00:41:43,719 --> 00:41:45,449
(laughter)

327
00:41:48,955 --> 00:41:54,437
Never quite understood
the attraction of a circus.

328
00:41:54,521 --> 00:41:57,200
(laughter)

329
00:41:59,673 --> 00:42:02,312
Till now. (laughs)

330
00:42:13,692 --> 00:42:16,248
Join the others in Stockton.
I'll catch you up.

331
00:42:16,785 --> 00:42:18,309
Hyah! Hyah!

332
00:42:18,394 --> 00:42:22,143
(laughter and whooping)

333
00:42:22,227 --> 00:42:24,989
Gentlemen, I have a few old memories
I'd like to revisit.

334
00:42:25,071 --> 00:42:27,380
Follow me.
(clicks tongue)

335
00:42:51,664 --> 00:42:54,386
Dang it!
He killed my whole family!

336
00:42:54,470 --> 00:42:57,848
God damn it, Baptiste,
let me go or I swear I'm gonna...

337
00:42:57,931 --> 00:43:00,405
- I-I-I'm sorry, Lynne.
- Lynne.

338
00:43:00,488 --> 00:43:02,425
This ain't just for your protection,
you know.

339
00:43:02,550 --> 00:43:04,403
It's for the whole goddamn town.

340
00:43:26,709 --> 00:43:28,771
(door closes)

341
00:44:30,163 --> 00:44:31,769
Let me see!

342
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:39,068
We have a winner!
Gentlemen?

343
00:44:39,151 --> 00:44:40,716
(man) Maria!

344
00:44:41,871 --> 00:44:43,561
(gun cocks)

345
00:44:43,644 --> 00:44:45,251
(speaks Spanish)

346
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:51,065
He is your, uh...
marido?

347
00:44:51,148 --> 00:44:52,878
My apologies.

348
00:44:52,961 --> 00:44:57,868
I am not the kind of man
who sleeps with a married woman.

349
00:44:57,951 --> 00:44:59,145
No.

350
00:44:59,228 --> 00:45:02,321
Por favor.
Gracias, Señor!

351
00:45:04,671 --> 00:45:06,278
(woman screams)

352
00:45:06,361 --> 00:45:08,092
Mommy! No!
(both sobbing)

353
00:45:09,414 --> 00:45:11,432
Oh!

354
00:45:11,515 --> 00:45:14,318
But their daughters...

355
00:45:14,402 --> 00:45:16,256
Oh, that's a completely
different matter.

356
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:18,358
Clean them up.

357
00:45:18,441 --> 00:45:21,162
You get a bullet in the head
for every louse I find.

358
00:45:40,087 --> 00:45:43,427
I once strung a man up
by his own hamstrings

359
00:45:43,511 --> 00:45:45,487
because he cooked me a steak
well-done.

360
00:45:45,570 --> 00:45:47,383
(laughs)

361
00:45:49,405 --> 00:45:50,806
What?

362
00:45:50,889 --> 00:45:53,280
Find that funny?

363
00:45:53,363 --> 00:45:55,135
Or is it because of this?

364
00:45:55,219 --> 00:45:57,733
(door opens)

365
00:46:01,032 --> 00:46:02,268
Thank you, gentlemen.

366
00:46:02,351 --> 00:46:05,607
This girl says she'll serve herself
up to you instead ofthe spics.

367
00:46:08,825 --> 00:46:11,420
Have we, uh, met before?

368
00:46:11,505 --> 00:46:14,677
No. We haven't.

369
00:46:14,762 --> 00:46:19,172
This is bound to be a night
you will never forget.

370
00:46:28,203 --> 00:46:30,016
You have good teeth.

371
00:46:30,099 --> 00:46:32,696
I like that.

372
00:46:32,779 --> 00:46:36,404
Colonel, as you unwrap me,

373
00:46:36,489 --> 00:46:39,747
I'm sure you will find there's
a whole lot more of me to like.

374
00:46:39,830 --> 00:46:42,260
I have no doubt ofthat.

375
00:46:42,343 --> 00:46:43,909
And though I may be young,

376
00:46:43,993 --> 00:46:46,961
I was hopin' you could teach me
a thing or two.

377
00:46:47,044 --> 00:46:49,310
Life's best lessons tend to hurt.

378
00:46:49,394 --> 00:46:53,064
Sharp pain
can bring sharp pleasure.

379
00:46:58,878 --> 00:47:01,267
Tell them to get.
This ain't the theatre.

380
00:47:03,123 --> 00:47:06,380
Gentlemen, you heard the lady.
Make yourselves scarce.

381
00:47:09,678 --> 00:47:11,327
(door closes)

382
00:47:23,243 --> 00:47:25,221
Lynne!

383
00:47:27,243 --> 00:47:28,520
She's not here!

384
00:47:43,034 --> 00:47:47,980
Now I, I might say
some things during.

385
00:47:48,064 --> 00:47:52,061
Feel free to answer if you like.

386
00:47:54,330 --> 00:47:57,258
Nothing is too wrong.

387
00:47:58,866 --> 00:48:02,618
I've been waitin' my whole life
for a place

388
00:48:02,701 --> 00:48:04,390
where it's right to be wrong.

389
00:48:04,472 --> 00:48:05,667
(grunts)

390
00:48:09,833 --> 00:48:16,429
You know, I don't think any part
ofthe body is dirty or bad.

391
00:48:16,512 --> 00:48:20,017
Just as long as it's well-scrubbed

392
00:48:23,068 --> 00:48:24,427
Yes.

393
00:48:57,164 --> 00:48:58,482
Assemble.

394
00:48:58,566 --> 00:49:00,009
Now.

395
00:49:03,884 --> 00:49:07,966
Now where do you plan
to begin the inspection?

396
00:49:08,050 --> 00:49:11,758
(water splashing)
I like where the skin creases...

397
00:49:11,842 --> 00:49:13,450
Go on.

398
00:49:13,533 --> 00:49:16,665
Between your nice... big...

399
00:49:20,047 --> 00:49:23,469
Moment I smelt your neck...

400
00:49:23,552 --> 00:49:26,684
it all came flooding back.

401
00:49:26,767 --> 00:49:31,012
No girl could ever smell as sweet.

402
00:49:33,405 --> 00:49:38,022
You changed it all.
My world.

403
00:49:38,104 --> 00:49:40,949
My face.

404
00:49:41,032 --> 00:49:44,372
You changed my life,
little girl.

405
00:49:46,557 --> 00:49:49,195
And now I'm...
I'm going to change yours.

406
00:49:58,143 --> 00:50:00,037
(grunting)

407
00:50:06,264 --> 00:50:10,676
That certainly is a beautiful scar
I gave you.

408
00:50:13,315 --> 00:50:17,561
(grunts) A hard-on for a scar.

409
00:50:17,645 --> 00:50:20,735
(chuckles)
Now that is wrong.

410
00:50:20,818 --> 00:50:22,755
Oops.

411
00:50:22,839 --> 00:50:24,941
I forgot.

412
00:50:25,024 --> 00:50:27,248
Nothing tonight is wrong.

413
00:50:27,332 --> 00:50:29,228
(grunting)

414
00:50:37,311 --> 00:50:40,361
Tell the cook
to fry up some potatoes

415
00:50:40,444 --> 00:50:42,092
(chuckles)

416
00:50:47,948 --> 00:50:50,586
And while we're waiting,
I thought I should give you

417
00:50:50,670 --> 00:50:56,152
what I was so generously offering
ten years ago.

418
00:50:58,625 --> 00:51:00,317
Enjoy the show.

419
00:51:15,697 --> 00:51:17,424
No! He's mine.

420
00:51:35,939 --> 00:51:39,360
- Lynne...
- Are you all right?

421
00:51:43,484 --> 00:51:45,214
Cover me!

422
00:51:46,164 --> 00:51:47,936
Hold on!

423
00:51:48,678 --> 00:51:50,204
Lynne!

424
00:52:20,467 --> 00:52:21,743
Agh!

425
00:52:32,342 --> 00:52:35,391
(indistinct murmuring)

426
00:52:42,484 --> 00:52:44,050
(man) Pull it off.

427
00:52:44,133 --> 00:52:47,885
- She got the wrong guy.
- That ain't him.

428
00:52:47,968 --> 00:52:49,944
(woman) Oh, God help us.

429
00:52:50,027 --> 00:52:52,626
Merry Christmas!
(laughs)

430
00:52:52,708 --> 00:52:56,294
Sweet mother of God,
it's a goddamn butcher shop in here!

431
00:52:56,377 --> 00:52:58,068
(indistinct murmuring)

432
00:53:58,511 --> 00:54:02,880
I must go
or you will all be in danger.

433
00:54:02,963 --> 00:54:05,519
(Eight-Ball)
We're in danger already.

434
00:54:05,603 --> 00:54:07,373
Colonel's on the loose.

435
00:54:07,458 --> 00:54:10,136
That's right.
Lynne here smoked the wrong guy.

436
00:54:10,219 --> 00:54:13,187
Now the Colonel's coming back,
and he's bringing the whole damn family.

437
00:54:13,271 --> 00:54:16,444
We need the guy who did
that butcherjob in the saloon.

438
00:54:16,527 --> 00:54:19,042
Well, I say
we all just pack up and leave.

439
00:54:19,125 --> 00:54:21,515
He's right! If you stay and fight,
you'll die like rats.

440
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:23,742
Well,
we'll die like rats with rifles.

441
00:54:23,826 --> 00:54:25,268
What rifles?

442
00:54:25,351 --> 00:54:27,947
You got a Chink with a sword
and a buncha juggling idiots.

443
00:54:28,030 --> 00:54:31,535
- How dare you?!
- That ain't all we got.

444
00:54:33,226 --> 00:54:35,162
Hey!

445
00:54:35,245 --> 00:54:37,265
Beth will understand.

446
00:54:42,006 --> 00:54:43,450
Follow me.

447
00:55:05,344 --> 00:55:08,600
I ruined everything.
Didn't I?

448
00:55:10,580 --> 00:55:12,434
You did what you had to do.

449
00:55:15,651 --> 00:55:19,403
You coulda just grabbed April
and hit the trail.

450
00:55:19,486 --> 00:55:21,505
But you didn't.

451
00:55:21,588 --> 00:55:26,123
Knowing saving me would ruin
every new thing you found here.

452
00:55:28,721 --> 00:55:33,131
This New World, without you...

453
00:55:33,214 --> 00:55:35,481
not so new.

454
00:55:41,255 --> 00:55:45,747
Hey, let's say somehow they all come
and go and we're still breathin'.

455
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:51,026
You're still gonna leave, right?

456
00:55:53,540 --> 00:55:55,272
That is the plan.

457
00:55:57,458 --> 00:55:59,765
Um...

458
00:55:59,849 --> 00:56:02,610
Maybe I could go with you?

459
00:56:07,270 --> 00:56:09,207
Just think about it, alright?

460
00:57:02,229 --> 00:57:03,382
Hey!

461
00:57:03,466 --> 00:57:05,897
That's my primo cactus juice!

462
00:57:05,981 --> 00:57:08,042
(laughter)

463
00:57:35,171 --> 00:57:38,881
Yee-haw! Whoo!

464
00:57:43,706 --> 00:57:46,178
I knew what you was
from the get-go.

465
00:57:46,262 --> 00:57:49,395
Don't need to look
at the size of a man.

466
00:57:49,478 --> 00:57:51,787
I can smell the blood.

467
00:57:51,870 --> 00:57:53,929
It was on you, too.

468
00:57:56,529 --> 00:57:57,806
Yeah.

469
00:58:02,053 --> 00:58:03,454
Good.

470
00:58:03,538 --> 00:58:06,176
Now,
get my jacket clean if you can.

471
00:58:06,259 --> 00:58:09,350
If I'm gonna die,
I want to look good doing it.

472
00:58:09,434 --> 00:58:11,123
Why die?

473
00:58:11,206 --> 00:58:14,008
'Cause we only got about a hundred
sticks of dynamite and a few weapons.

474
00:58:14,092 --> 00:58:17,843
That ain't much more
'n to sting them with.

475
00:58:17,928 --> 00:58:19,986
You also have that.

476
00:58:41,427 --> 00:58:46,085
Done a good job on this garden.
Well, for a laundry man.

477
00:58:48,519 --> 00:58:51,403
You do a good shooting.

478
00:58:51,486 --> 00:58:54,455
- For a drunken man.
- (chuckles)

479
00:58:54,539 --> 00:58:56,187
Why you stopped the shooting?

480
00:58:56,271 --> 00:59:02,001
Well, I just went around
robbing banks, hitting trains

481
00:59:02,083 --> 00:59:07,648
till I ran into the only force
that can truly bring down any outlaw.

482
00:59:07,731 --> 00:59:09,709
Sheriff?

483
00:59:09,793 --> 00:59:12,348
(grunts) Woman.

484
00:59:14,369 --> 00:59:16,924
When I was with her,
I didn't wanna run.

485
00:59:20,595 --> 00:59:22,285
What happened then?

486
00:59:22,369 --> 00:59:26,078
There was a couple of Rangers
who hadn't forgot about me.

487
00:59:28,141 --> 00:59:31,396
They ambushed me.

488
00:59:31,479 --> 00:59:33,458
Bullets flyin' everywhere.

489
00:59:35,315 --> 00:59:37,045
One of 'em found Beth.

490
00:59:38,860 --> 00:59:43,889
Last thing she ever said to me was,
"Don't never pick up no gun again."

491
00:59:44,961 --> 00:59:47,848
So far...

492
00:59:47,931 --> 00:59:50,610
Well, at least till today...

493
00:59:50,694 --> 00:59:52,672
I done what she asked.

494
00:59:55,064 --> 00:59:59,968
But for fellas like me and you,
we are what we are.

495
01:00:02,526 --> 01:00:07,720
If you truly love somethin'
or somebody, Laundry Man...

496
01:00:07,803 --> 01:00:11,678
you get as far away
from 'em as possible.

497
01:00:11,761 --> 01:00:15,554
'Cause we're sand.

498
01:00:17,781 --> 01:00:19,389
They're flowers.

499
01:00:28,376 --> 01:00:30,396
(door opens)

500
01:00:42,106 --> 01:00:43,920
These are yours.

501
01:00:44,003 --> 01:00:45,940
These are to kill.

502
01:00:57,073 --> 01:00:58,350
Come.

503
01:01:02,474 --> 01:01:04,492
Closer.

504
01:01:18,182 --> 01:01:34,466
Here.

505
01:01:34,550 --> 01:01:37,394
Remember these places.

506
01:01:37,477 --> 01:01:39,909
Fastest way to kill your enemy.

507
01:02:05,471 --> 01:02:07,573
I will remember.

508
01:02:09,677 --> 01:02:11,944
(bell clanging)

509
01:02:58,163 --> 01:03:00,843
(whimpering)

510
01:03:54,070 --> 01:03:55,430
(laughter)

511
01:03:55,514 --> 01:03:57,698
(man) Company charge!

512
01:03:57,783 --> 01:03:59,841
(shouting and whooping)

513
01:04:23,715 --> 01:04:26,640
Oh... (whimpers)

514
01:04:34,228 --> 01:04:36,289
(shouting and whooping continues)

515
01:04:41,154 --> 01:05:03,211
(gunshot)

516
01:05:05,645 --> 01:05:08,738
(men scream, horses whinnying)

517
01:05:13,685 --> 01:05:15,622
(men groaning and coughing)

518
01:05:23,992 --> 01:05:26,877
(sword rings, pistols cock)

519
01:05:26,961 --> 01:05:30,257
Hey!
(sword ringing, wet impacts)

520
01:05:30,341 --> 01:05:31,619
What the hell? Agh!

521
01:05:31,702 --> 01:05:34,793
(men sputtering and choking)

522
01:06:11,077 --> 01:06:13,383
Come on!
(men shouting)

523
01:06:28,351 --> 01:06:31,030
(steam whistle toots)

524
01:06:35,442 --> 01:06:37,875
(machinery whirs,
calliope plays)

525
01:06:51,686 --> 01:06:54,449
(spooky laughter)

526
01:06:54,615 --> 01:06:58,654
(men screaming)

527
01:07:11,064 --> 01:07:12,465
Whoo!

528
01:07:16,961 --> 01:07:19,557
Get up there!
Everybody, up there!

529
01:07:19,641 --> 01:07:20,877
(men shouting)

530
01:07:21,950 --> 01:07:23,599
Come on men! Agh!

531
01:07:33,495 --> 01:07:37,614
(screams)

532
01:07:39,431 --> 01:07:41,285
Get him, down there!

533
01:07:47,471 --> 01:07:48,831
Get down.

534
01:07:49,945 --> 01:07:51,344
(Colonel) Shoot them!

535
01:08:10,394 --> 01:08:11,920
Ah!

536
01:08:12,003 --> 01:08:13,980
(men shouting indistinctly)

537
01:08:35,419 --> 01:08:36,946
Okay, let's get out of here.

538
01:08:45,358 --> 01:08:46,635
Shoot them!

539
01:08:50,016 --> 01:08:51,416
Shit.

540
01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:54,138
(man) Dynamite!
Run for your lives!

541
01:08:54,221 --> 01:08:56,487
Take cover!

542
01:08:59,417 --> 01:09:02,300
Ya-hoo!

543
01:09:45,346 --> 01:09:47,240
Shit! We did it!

544
01:09:47,324 --> 01:09:49,180
(all cheer)

545
01:09:49,263 --> 01:09:50,499
(gunshot, all gasp)

546
01:09:50,583 --> 01:09:51,982
They hit Jacques!

547
01:09:55,200 --> 01:09:57,384
Come on!
Back to town!

548
01:09:57,467 --> 01:09:59,321
(indistinct shouting)

549
01:09:59,405 --> 01:10:00,971
Come on.
(gunshots)

550
01:10:03,363 --> 01:10:06,618
Let's close this damn circus down!
Burn it!

551
01:10:06,702 --> 01:10:09,259
(screaming)

552
01:10:09,342 --> 01:10:10,371
Come on!

553
01:11:04,176 --> 01:11:07,722
(rifle cocks)

554
01:11:07,804 --> 01:11:09,370
(gunshot, crow caws)

555
01:11:14,401 --> 01:11:15,597
Kill.

556
01:11:34,439 --> 01:11:35,716
Run.

557
01:11:56,704 --> 01:11:59,711
Hey, come on!
Into the hotel!

558
01:11:59,795 --> 01:12:01,072
Keep low!

559
01:12:01,155 --> 01:12:04,577
(men screaming)

560
01:12:13,111 --> 01:12:14,306
Get them!

561
01:13:39,117 --> 01:13:40,601
(indistinct shouting and gunfire)

562
01:14:28,757 --> 01:14:31,066
Here! Take her!

563
01:14:36,550 --> 01:14:37,621
Skinny!

564
01:14:47,146 --> 01:14:51,061
(gunshots, April cries)

565
01:14:51,145 --> 01:14:53,865
(Eight-Ball wheezing and grunting)

566
01:15:03,391 --> 01:15:06,399
I-I couldn't protect April.

567
01:15:17,533 --> 01:15:19,922
(April crying in distance)

568
01:15:24,004 --> 01:15:25,859
Guard the hallway!

569
01:15:25,942 --> 01:15:28,458
And don't let a damn soul
into this room!

570
01:15:34,436 --> 01:15:36,498
(distant gunfire)

571
01:15:54,762 --> 01:15:57,853
(sword tip dragging)

572
01:16:12,449 --> 01:16:13,974
What the...

573
01:16:15,954 --> 01:16:17,973
(chokes and sputters)

574
01:16:40,115 --> 01:16:41,143
Agh!

575
01:16:42,588 --> 01:16:44,195
(sword tip dragging)

576
01:16:57,430 --> 01:17:00,029
One more step,
and she's soup.

577
01:17:01,471 --> 01:17:03,902
I said stop!

578
01:17:49,051 --> 01:17:50,821
(both grunting)

579
01:18:55,017 --> 01:18:56,128
Yah!

580
01:18:56,212 --> 01:18:58,396
Agh!

581
01:19:00,790 --> 01:19:03,592
That sure is a purty scar
I gave you.

582
01:19:09,819 --> 01:19:11,591
Agh! Ooh!

583
01:19:13,159 --> 01:19:14,724
Ooh! Ugh!

584
01:19:47,295 --> 01:19:51,541
I'll see you in Hell, little girl.
(chuckles)

585
01:19:51,625 --> 01:19:55,500
Wear something nasty.
(laughs)

586
01:19:55,584 --> 01:19:56,903
Yaah!

587
01:20:28,319 --> 01:20:31,410
Is this the new life
you have found?

588
01:20:34,505 --> 01:20:36,029
Funny.

589
01:20:36,112 --> 01:20:39,203
Look much like the old one.

590
01:20:45,718 --> 01:20:50,665
Do you think you will tell her
that you kill her mother,

591
01:20:50,749 --> 01:20:55,819
her father and her entire clan?

592
01:20:57,757 --> 01:21:00,148
She is the enemy.

593
01:21:00,232 --> 01:21:05,260
She will always be the enemy.

594
01:21:05,343 --> 01:21:10,950
You came to me to be strong.

595
01:21:11,033 --> 01:21:14,950
I have made you the strongest.

596
01:21:17,918 --> 01:21:20,392
Kill her now.

597
01:21:20,475 --> 01:21:25,092
You do not belong here.

598
01:21:25,175 --> 01:21:26,494
I do.

599
01:21:29,379 --> 01:21:31,276
I did.

600
01:23:17,485 --> 01:23:21,524
You have the perfect body
for an assassin

601
01:23:21,607 --> 01:23:23,503
but the heart of a priest.

602
01:23:32,821 --> 01:23:35,543
Your heart will become
your biggest enemy.

603
01:23:50,674 --> 01:23:53,848
You must kill your biggest enemy.

604
01:23:53,932 --> 01:23:56,076
We are assassins.

605
01:23:56,159 --> 01:23:59,991
All that we love,
we will destroy.

606
01:24:21,638 --> 01:24:24,441
You are assassin.

607
01:24:24,523 --> 01:24:29,057
All that you love,
you'll destroy.

608
01:26:33,695 --> 01:26:35,632
Did we win?

609
01:26:35,715 --> 01:26:38,436
We survived.

610
01:26:38,519 --> 01:26:40,167
Some of us.

611
01:26:42,561 --> 01:26:46,022
I'm not goin' with you.
Am I?

612
01:27:38,838 --> 01:27:42,258
I guess that's the end ofthem.

613
01:27:42,342 --> 01:27:43,496
No.

614
01:27:43,579 --> 01:27:46,258
It is just the beginning.

615
01:27:46,342 --> 01:27:49,599
What about the baby?
She gonna be safe?

616
01:27:49,682 --> 01:27:53,845
They are listening for this to cry.

617
01:27:55,907 --> 01:27:57,554
Not her.

618
01:28:11,945 --> 01:28:14,830
That's right, Sand Man.

619
01:28:14,913 --> 01:28:16,645
Keep walkin'.

620
01:28:22,500 --> 01:28:25,180
The warrior walked away.

621
01:28:25,263 --> 01:28:27,940
And legend has it,
he never stopped walkin',

622
01:28:28,024 --> 01:28:32,929
always making sure to keep
as much distance as possible

623
01:28:33,012 --> 01:28:37,961
between himself
and the little gal he loved.

624
01:29:09,007 --> 01:29:11,314
(woman singing operatically)

625
01:29:21,707 --> 01:29:22,982
How much?

626
01:29:32,549 --> 01:29:34,198
Free.

627
01:29:35,243 --> 01:29:38,373
(singing continues)
