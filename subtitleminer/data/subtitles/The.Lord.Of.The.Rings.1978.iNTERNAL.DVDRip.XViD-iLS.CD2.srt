1
00:00:01,406 --> 00:00:02,896
Come. Follow me.

2
00:00:04,109 --> 00:00:05,133
Obey him!

3
00:00:25,564 --> 00:00:28,397
- There may be a bit of a scar, Sam.
- I don't care.

4
00:00:28,934 --> 00:00:30,526
Now it is your turn, Frodo.

5
00:00:30,735 --> 00:00:32,794
I'm all right. What does it matter now?

6
00:00:32,871 --> 00:00:35,863
It matters. We still have a long road,
and much to do.

7
00:00:35,941 --> 00:00:38,842
Why? We've no hope without Gandalf.
You know that, Aragorn.

8
00:00:39,311 --> 00:00:42,769
Then we must do without hope.
There is always vengeance.

9
00:00:45,851 --> 00:00:47,113
Mithril shirt!

10
00:00:48,086 --> 00:00:49,713
That's what saved you.

11
00:00:50,222 --> 00:00:52,486
I have never seen one so beautiful.

12
00:00:52,557 --> 00:00:53,717
- There!
- What is it?

13
00:00:54,025 --> 00:00:56,459
The footsteps,
I heard them in Moria, following.

14
00:00:56,528 --> 00:00:58,758
The Orcs will not come after us until dark.

15
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:02,266
It never sounds like an Orc.
They're bare feet and they flap.

16
00:01:02,567 --> 00:01:05,764
Whatever creature it is,
it won't follow us where we're going.

17
00:01:05,837 --> 00:01:07,862
Nothing evil passes through Lothlorien.

18
00:01:07,939 --> 00:01:11,238
- That is not what we say in Gondor.
- Then you know nothing in Gondor.

19
00:01:11,743 --> 00:01:15,736
Out of Moria into the Golden Wood.
Is there no way less perilous?

20
00:01:16,548 --> 00:01:20,314
I would almost rather face
the Balrog again, than the Lady.

21
00:01:20,485 --> 00:01:23,852
Lothlorien is a place of healing.
There is no evil in it...

22
00:01:24,222 --> 00:01:26,383
...unless a man brings evil there with him.

23
00:01:26,458 --> 00:01:28,050
Welcome to Lothlorien.

24
00:01:29,427 --> 00:01:32,885
I am Galadriel
and this is my lord, Celeborn.

25
00:01:34,666 --> 00:01:37,226
The forests have told us of your loss.

26
00:01:37,936 --> 00:01:41,235
We sorrow for you,
and for all of Middle-earth.

27
00:01:41,306 --> 00:01:44,571
Rest here now for a little,
until you are healed.

28
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:46,975
Your quest is known to us.

29
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,206
We will do what we can to aid you.

30
00:01:51,082 --> 00:01:53,073
Frodo Baggins of the Shire?

31
00:02:19,511 --> 00:02:24,847
'"Let the night never cease to call you

32
00:02:24,916 --> 00:02:29,353
'"Let the day never more be the same'"

33
00:02:29,554 --> 00:02:31,488
It is a song about Gandalf, isn't it?

34
00:02:31,556 --> 00:02:35,492
Yes, Mithrandir
was the Elves' name for him.

35
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,425
It means, Grey Pilgrim.

36
00:02:37,495 --> 00:02:41,659
We knew so little of him in the Shire,
Aragorn. He was just Gandalf, to us.

37
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,961
We never knew he had so many names.

38
00:02:44,235 --> 00:02:46,294
I think he was fondest of Gandalf.

39
00:02:46,371 --> 00:02:50,603
'"We 're still guided by your light

40
00:02:51,309 --> 00:02:56,269
'"You're walking beside us

41
00:02:56,414 --> 00:03:01,113
'"A prayer in the night

42
00:03:01,853 --> 00:03:06,984
'"With the fear rushing thru the shadows

43
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:12,085
'"Like a star shining deep in his heart

44
00:03:12,464 --> 00:03:16,833
'"You will know in your hearts forever

45
00:03:17,636 --> 00:03:20,127
'"Never more

46
00:03:20,205 --> 00:03:23,174
'"Will we stand

47
00:03:23,642 --> 00:03:26,668
'"Alone'"

48
00:03:27,679 --> 00:03:30,341
This is the mirror of Galadriel.

49
00:03:31,349 --> 00:03:34,341
It shows things that were,
and things that are...

50
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:37,250
...and things that yet may be.

51
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:39,118
Do you wish to look?

52
00:03:41,359 --> 00:03:43,827
I'd not mind a glimpse
of what's going on at home.

53
00:03:43,895 --> 00:03:46,125
It seems a terrible long time
I've been away.

54
00:03:46,331 --> 00:03:48,697
Come then, you shall look...

55
00:03:49,367 --> 00:03:51,733
...and see what you may.

56
00:03:54,039 --> 00:03:57,133
I got to go home!
They've dug up Bagshot Row...

57
00:03:57,208 --> 00:04:00,803
...and thrown my poor old Gaffer
out in the street. I've got to go home.

58
00:04:00,979 --> 00:04:05,279
The mirror shows many things, Sam,
and not all have yet come to pass.

59
00:04:06,217 --> 00:04:10,119
Some never come to be,
unless those that behold the visions...

60
00:04:10,188 --> 00:04:12,918
...turn aside from their path
to prevent them.

61
00:04:16,428 --> 00:04:19,727
Do you wish to leave Frodo now,
and go home?

62
00:04:20,999 --> 00:04:21,829
No.

63
00:04:30,075 --> 00:04:31,064
Gandalf?

64
00:04:32,077 --> 00:04:34,773
No, it must be Saruman.

65
00:04:50,628 --> 00:04:52,357
Do not touch the water.

66
00:04:54,099 --> 00:04:55,532
He is looking for you.

67
00:04:56,034 --> 00:04:58,901
But he cannot find you, not here, not yet.

68
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:01,067
The door is closed.

69
00:05:03,608 --> 00:05:07,169
Three Rings for the Elven-kings
under the sky.

70
00:05:07,645 --> 00:05:08,509
Yes.

71
00:05:09,748 --> 00:05:13,047
We hid those three from him,
and he has never touched them.

72
00:05:13,685 --> 00:05:15,243
If your quest fails...

73
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:18,953
...then nothing can stand against him
and we are defenseless.

74
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:23,852
Yet, if you succeed,
if the One Ring is destroyed...

75
00:05:24,129 --> 00:05:26,791
...all we built with the three will fade.

76
00:05:27,232 --> 00:05:30,963
Time will come here,
and Lothlorien will fade.

77
00:05:32,036 --> 00:05:35,062
You are the footstep of doom to us, Frodo.

78
00:05:35,707 --> 00:05:39,541
Lady Galadriel, I will give you
the One Ring, if you ask for it.

79
00:05:41,179 --> 00:05:42,840
It's too great a matter for me.

80
00:05:47,986 --> 00:05:50,614
And I came to test your heart.

81
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:55,489
You will give me the Great Ring freely...

82
00:05:56,161 --> 00:05:59,756
...and in place of the Dark Lord
you will set up a queen.

83
00:06:00,565 --> 00:06:03,591
And I shall not be evil, but beautiful...

84
00:06:03,668 --> 00:06:06,228
...and terrible as the morning
and the night.

85
00:06:07,405 --> 00:06:10,238
Stronger than the foundations of the earth.

86
00:06:10,308 --> 00:06:14,005
All shall love me and despair!

87
00:06:17,549 --> 00:06:19,483
I pass the test.

88
00:06:21,052 --> 00:06:25,512
I will diminish and go into the west
and remain Galadriel.

89
00:06:26,858 --> 00:06:29,452
And you must depart in the morning.

90
00:06:38,136 --> 00:06:40,696
For Gondor and the House of Isildur.

91
00:06:41,272 --> 00:06:44,673
For Gondor and the city of Minas Tirith.

92
00:06:50,915 --> 00:06:53,406
In a few days, we will have to choose:

93
00:06:53,484 --> 00:06:56,783
Shall we turn west with Boromir
and go to the wars of Gondor...

94
00:06:56,855 --> 00:06:59,653
...or turn east to Mordor and its Dark Lord?

95
00:06:59,724 --> 00:07:01,919
Or shall we break our fellowship?

96
00:07:01,993 --> 00:07:03,722
I'm going with Mr. Frodo.

97
00:07:04,362 --> 00:07:05,727
I know that, Sam.

98
00:07:09,834 --> 00:07:13,270
What a place. What a horrible place!

99
00:07:18,509 --> 00:07:22,502
Behold the Argonath,
the pillars of the kings.

100
00:07:23,882 --> 00:07:27,340
They are Isildur and Anarion,
my fathers of old.

101
00:07:29,087 --> 00:07:30,918
If Gandalf were here...

102
00:07:42,967 --> 00:07:47,495
The day has come at last, the day
of choice, which we have long delayed.

103
00:07:48,806 --> 00:07:51,070
What shall now become of our company?

104
00:07:52,744 --> 00:07:55,440
I am not Gandalf.

105
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:58,572
I have tried to guide you
as he would've done, but...

106
00:07:59,317 --> 00:08:02,377
...if he had any plan for this moment,
he never told me.

107
00:08:02,887 --> 00:08:07,586
Even if he had, if he had lived...

108
00:08:08,059 --> 00:08:11,358
...I think the burden
would still have fallen on you, Frodo.

109
00:08:11,763 --> 00:08:13,890
You alone can choose your way now.

110
00:08:15,533 --> 00:08:17,023
The burden is heavy.

111
00:08:18,503 --> 00:08:20,733
Give me an hour longer, and I will speak.

112
00:08:20,805 --> 00:08:22,170
Let me be alone!

113
00:08:23,942 --> 00:08:27,173
You shall have your hour.
And you shall be alone.

114
00:08:34,118 --> 00:08:35,380
Who's there?

115
00:08:37,922 --> 00:08:38,752
Boromir.

116
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:40,580
I was afraid for you, Frodo.

117
00:08:42,727 --> 00:08:45,321
The Orcs may be on this side
of the river by now.

118
00:08:45,396 --> 00:08:47,887
May I stay and talk to you, just for a while?

119
00:08:47,966 --> 00:08:50,662
You're kind, but there's nothing to be said.

120
00:08:51,002 --> 00:08:54,403
I know what I should do,
but I'm afraid of doing it, Boromir.

121
00:08:54,472 --> 00:08:57,270
I wish I could help you.
Will you hear my counsel?

122
00:08:57,475 --> 00:08:59,943
I know what your advice would be:

123
00:09:00,011 --> 00:09:03,344
To go with you to Gondor
and use the Ring to defend Minas Tirith.

124
00:09:03,414 --> 00:09:05,314
And is that such ill counsel?

125
00:09:06,317 --> 00:09:09,115
Why should we fear to use the Ring
in a just cause?

126
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:12,455
Whatever is done with the Ring
turns to evil.

127
00:09:12,523 --> 00:09:16,289
Gandalf and Elrond refused to touch it,
and Galadriel herself...

128
00:09:16,527 --> 00:09:18,791
Yes, I know all that.

129
00:09:18,896 --> 00:09:22,627
And for themselves, they may be right,
these Elves and half-Elves and Wizards!

130
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,895
But truehearted Men will not be corrupted.

131
00:09:24,969 --> 00:09:29,872
We, of Minas Tirith, do not seek power.
Only the strength to defend ourselves.

132
00:09:29,941 --> 00:09:31,704
Where is the evil in that, Frodo?

133
00:09:34,312 --> 00:09:36,337
You cannot answer me, none of them can.

134
00:09:36,414 --> 00:09:38,882
It's folly not using the Enemy's power
against him.

135
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:41,714
Think what Aragorn could do
with the Ring in this hour.

136
00:09:41,786 --> 00:09:44,516
Or if he refuses, why not Boromir?

137
00:09:46,591 --> 00:09:51,927
How I would drive the hosts of Mordor,
until I stood face to face with Sauron.

138
00:09:51,996 --> 00:09:54,226
And they tell us to throw it away!

139
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,027
Come with me, Frodo.

140
00:09:58,569 --> 00:10:00,332
My city is not far.

141
00:10:00,438 --> 00:10:02,963
You can go to Mordor from there,
if you must.

142
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:05,771
Only, trust me, let me try my plan.

143
00:10:07,111 --> 00:10:08,635
Lend me the Ring.

144
00:10:09,213 --> 00:10:11,443
No, Boromir. No!

145
00:10:12,283 --> 00:10:16,049
Fool, obstinate fool!
It is only yours by chance.

146
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,088
It might have been mine.

147
00:10:18,156 --> 00:10:20,488
It should be mine. Give it to me!

148
00:10:24,495 --> 00:10:25,962
Miserable trickster!

149
00:10:26,497 --> 00:10:28,397
You'll sell us all to Sauron.

150
00:10:29,767 --> 00:10:31,860
Traitor!

151
00:10:32,437 --> 00:10:36,271
Curse you to death and darkness,
all you Halflings!

152
00:10:40,645 --> 00:10:42,340
What have I done?

153
00:10:44,348 --> 00:10:46,043
Frodo, come back!

154
00:10:46,851 --> 00:10:49,945
A madness took me, but it has passed.

155
00:10:50,521 --> 00:10:52,512
Come back!

156
00:11:02,467 --> 00:11:04,435
This waiting's horrible.

157
00:11:05,503 --> 00:11:08,836
Where have you been, Boromir?
Have you seen Frodo?

158
00:11:10,274 --> 00:11:12,868
I tried to convince him
to come to Minas Tirith.

159
00:11:15,613 --> 00:11:18,776
I grew angry and he vanished.

160
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:21,247
Is that all you have to say?

161
00:11:23,121 --> 00:11:24,520
He put the Ring on.

162
00:11:24,589 --> 00:11:27,023
But where did he go? Where is he?

163
00:11:27,091 --> 00:11:29,150
Mr. Frodo!

164
00:11:29,927 --> 00:11:31,451
Gimli, Legolas, stop them!

165
00:11:34,298 --> 00:11:37,563
I don't know what part you've played
in this mischief, but help now!

166
00:11:37,635 --> 00:11:42,436
Go after Merry and Pippin and guard them,
even if you cannot find Frodo. Go on!

167
00:11:48,719 --> 00:11:50,983
Follow me, Sam. Stay close.

168
00:11:52,189 --> 00:11:55,920
Sam Gamgee, your legs are too short,
so use your head.

169
00:12:00,864 --> 00:12:02,855
The boats.

170
00:12:07,605 --> 00:12:09,129
Coming, Mr. Frodo.

171
00:12:09,206 --> 00:12:10,366
Coming!

172
00:12:11,275 --> 00:12:13,072
It's only water, now.

173
00:12:21,085 --> 00:12:22,416
I'm here, Sam.

174
00:12:22,486 --> 00:12:23,646
Save me, Mr. Frodo.

175
00:12:23,721 --> 00:12:25,188
Help, I'm drowning!

176
00:12:25,256 --> 00:12:27,053
- Take my hand.
- Where's your hand?

177
00:12:27,124 --> 00:12:28,819
Here. Here it is.

178
00:12:33,297 --> 00:12:36,198
Of all the confounded nuisances
I ever knew.

179
00:12:36,467 --> 00:12:38,526
Mr. Frodo, that's hard.

180
00:12:38,636 --> 00:12:41,127
If I hadn't guessed right,
where would you be now?

181
00:12:41,205 --> 00:12:42,900
Safely on my way.

182
00:12:43,474 --> 00:12:46,773
"Safely"?
All alone and without me to help you?

183
00:12:46,844 --> 00:12:49,278
But I am going to Mordor.

184
00:12:50,781 --> 00:12:53,909
Well, of course you are,
Mr. Frodo, and I'm coming with you.

185
00:12:59,757 --> 00:13:01,748
It's no good trying to escape you.

186
00:13:04,595 --> 00:13:06,085
I'm glad, Sam.

187
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,660
May the others find a safe road.

188
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:14,701
Aragorn will look after them.

189
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:20,542
I don't suppose we shall see them again.

190
00:13:20,911 --> 00:13:24,847
Yet we may, Mr. Frodo. We may.

191
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:37,627
This way!

192
00:13:37,861 --> 00:13:38,828
Frodo!

193
00:13:46,203 --> 00:13:47,500
Halfling.

194
00:15:31,175 --> 00:15:32,369
Boromir.

195
00:15:59,269 --> 00:16:00,463
Boromir.

196
00:16:03,006 --> 00:16:05,497
I tried to take the Ring from Frodo.

197
00:16:06,176 --> 00:16:09,839
I'm sorry. I have paid.

198
00:16:13,116 --> 00:16:16,381
Aragorn, go to Minas Tirith.

199
00:16:16,987 --> 00:16:18,545
Save my people.

200
00:16:20,824 --> 00:16:22,052
Aragorn...

201
00:16:24,194 --> 00:16:25,422
I will go...

202
00:16:26,296 --> 00:16:27,627
...I promise you.

203
00:16:29,032 --> 00:16:32,729
The Halflings, Orcs took them.

204
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:37,065
I think they are not dead.

205
00:17:05,903 --> 00:17:08,269
Either we take the last boat
and follow Frodo...

206
00:17:08,338 --> 00:17:10,272
...or we follow the Orcs on foot.

207
00:17:10,674 --> 00:17:13,837
Pippin and Merry may be dead by now.
We don't know.

208
00:17:15,812 --> 00:17:17,780
We cannot forsake them.

209
00:17:18,448 --> 00:17:21,884
The fate of the Ring-bearer
is in my hands no longer.

210
00:17:22,486 --> 00:17:24,852
The company of the Ring
has played its part.

211
00:17:25,923 --> 00:17:27,788
We follow the Orcs.

212
00:19:59,242 --> 00:20:00,209
Filth!

213
00:20:00,277 --> 00:20:01,801
Maggots!

214
00:20:02,212 --> 00:20:04,339
Can't run.

215
00:20:43,787 --> 00:20:48,053
Hello, Pippin.
So you've come on this expedition, too?

216
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:51,960
When do we get bed and breakfast?

217
00:20:52,028 --> 00:20:56,931
Bed and breakfast in Isengard, understand?

218
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:28,590
They are alive.

219
00:21:28,665 --> 00:21:29,962
One of them, anyway.

220
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:32,159
Pippin, I think, by the footprints.

221
00:21:32,869 --> 00:21:35,599
How far ahead of us are they, Aragorn?

222
00:21:35,672 --> 00:21:41,008
Almost a day. Shall we rest by night,
or go on while our strength holds?

223
00:21:41,077 --> 00:21:42,840
Do you think the Orcs will rest?

224
00:21:42,913 --> 00:21:47,907
Yet, in the dark we may lose the trail,
or miss a sign, like that brooch.

225
00:21:47,984 --> 00:21:50,111
There will be no more signs.

226
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,517
I cannot run all the way to Isengard.

227
00:23:34,557 --> 00:23:37,025
Thank goodness for that rope
the Elves gave you.

228
00:23:37,093 --> 00:23:40,153
We'd never have gotten down
that last cliff without it.

229
00:23:49,439 --> 00:23:52,203
There's Mount Doom again, Mr. Frodo.
See it?

230
00:24:03,286 --> 00:24:04,844
What a fix!

231
00:24:04,988 --> 00:24:07,752
The one place
that we don't want to see any closer...

232
00:24:07,824 --> 00:24:10,349
...and that's the one place
we're trying to get to.

233
00:24:13,997 --> 00:24:16,124
We're plain lost, Mr. Frodo.

234
00:24:23,907 --> 00:24:26,239
I'm tired, Sam.
I don't know what's to be done.

235
00:24:26,309 --> 00:24:30,575
We must find a place to camp, I suppose.
Maybe there'll be a path tomorrow.

236
00:24:38,722 --> 00:24:41,418
Cautious, my precious.

237
00:24:51,067 --> 00:24:52,193
Don't turn!

238
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:54,598
It's him.

239
00:25:01,044 --> 00:25:04,480
That Gollum?
That thing who had Mr. Bilbo's ring?

240
00:25:04,547 --> 00:25:06,378
He's been following us since Moria.

241
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:10,277
My precious! More haste, less speed.

242
00:25:12,989 --> 00:25:15,457
Well, he'll be sorry he found us again.

243
00:25:15,625 --> 00:25:19,288
Be careful!
He's much more dangerous than he looks.

244
00:25:28,805 --> 00:25:31,899
Where is it, my precious?

245
00:25:32,909 --> 00:25:36,743
It's ours, it is, and we wants it.

246
00:25:41,317 --> 00:25:42,682
Got you, you spying...

247
00:25:48,258 --> 00:25:51,489
Let go, Gollum!
Let go, or I'll cut your throat!

248
00:25:51,561 --> 00:25:53,028
Don't hurt us!

249
00:25:53,096 --> 00:25:54,927
Don't let them hurt us, precious.

250
00:25:54,998 --> 00:25:56,795
Cruel little Hobbitses.

251
00:25:59,135 --> 00:26:03,071
Jumps on us
like cats on poor mices, Gollum.

252
00:26:04,407 --> 00:26:09,709
We'll be nice to them if they'll be nice
to us, won't we, precious?

253
00:26:10,914 --> 00:26:14,350
Pity Mr. Bilbo didn't kill the creature
when he had the chance.

254
00:26:15,185 --> 00:26:19,087
I will not touch him.
Now that I see him, I do pity him.

255
00:26:19,222 --> 00:26:23,921
Yes, Hobbits won't kill us,
not Hobbits, huh?

256
00:26:23,993 --> 00:26:26,723
No, we won't.
But we won't let you go, either.

257
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:29,458
You will have to come with us
and help us, if you can.

258
00:26:29,799 --> 00:26:31,994
Yes, indeed!

259
00:26:32,435 --> 00:26:33,800
Nice Hobbits!

260
00:26:35,438 --> 00:26:40,137
And where are they going in these cold,
hard lands, we wonder?

261
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:42,608
We are going to Mordor. You know that.

262
00:26:42,679 --> 00:26:44,772
Lead us to the gates of his land.

263
00:26:46,716 --> 00:26:48,308
No, precious.

264
00:26:48,384 --> 00:26:50,249
Hobbits mustn't go there.

265
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,618
Gollum! Leave us alone!

266
00:26:53,523 --> 00:26:54,512
Gotcha!

267
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,590
I think your rope might prove useful again.

268
00:26:59,662 --> 00:27:02,460
Tie one end to his ankle.
We want him to walk.

269
00:27:02,532 --> 00:27:04,591
Don't hurt us! No!

270
00:27:11,107 --> 00:27:13,041
It burns! It bites!

271
00:27:13,243 --> 00:27:14,835
It freezes!

272
00:27:14,911 --> 00:27:17,038
Take it off us. It hurts us.

273
00:27:17,247 --> 00:27:18,475
Don't you do it!

274
00:27:18,548 --> 00:27:20,015
It hurts us.

275
00:27:20,183 --> 00:27:22,481
What promise can you give me
that I can trust?

276
00:27:22,552 --> 00:27:25,487
Smeagol will be very good.

277
00:27:26,022 --> 00:27:29,423
Smeagol will swear
never to let him have it.

278
00:27:29,726 --> 00:27:31,557
Smeagol will save it.

279
00:27:32,028 --> 00:27:35,987
The precious is before you, Smeagol.
Speak your promise!

280
00:27:37,267 --> 00:27:40,794
We promises, yes, I promise...

281
00:27:41,504 --> 00:27:44,837
...I will serve the master of the precious.

282
00:27:45,275 --> 00:27:48,676
Good master, good Smeagol.

283
00:27:48,745 --> 00:27:50,679
Take the rope off, Sam.

284
00:27:53,616 --> 00:27:56,517
Off we go. Follow Smeagol.

285
00:27:56,986 --> 00:28:01,787
Smeagol knows a secret way, he does,
across the marshes.

286
00:28:01,891 --> 00:28:03,188
Follow Smeagol.

287
00:28:43,366 --> 00:28:47,097
I said, "No shooting."

288
00:28:47,537 --> 00:28:52,304
You're wasting arrows, dunghill swine!

289
00:28:58,214 --> 00:29:02,241
Snaga, Lugdush, stand guard.

290
00:29:02,785 --> 00:29:05,253
Bind their legs.

291
00:29:05,555 --> 00:29:09,321
White-skins break through. Understand?

292
00:29:09,926 --> 00:29:12,793
You and your stinking Wizard.

293
00:29:13,196 --> 00:29:15,164
You got us into this.

294
00:29:15,865 --> 00:29:19,562
When I tell them in Mordor...

295
00:29:24,707 --> 00:29:28,438
They are far, far away.

296
00:29:49,599 --> 00:29:53,399
If stinking Wizard doesn't get you,
the white-skins will.

297
00:29:53,803 --> 00:29:57,102
You won't get it that way.
It isn't easy to find.

298
00:29:58,308 --> 00:30:01,141
Get it? Get what?

299
00:30:02,045 --> 00:30:04,673
Nothing, my precious.

300
00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:09,743
It's no good groping in the dark.

301
00:30:10,286 --> 00:30:11,878
Ugluk will be back any minute.

302
00:30:12,488 --> 00:30:14,046
Nothing for Mordor.

303
00:30:14,123 --> 00:30:18,150
Nothing for poor Grishnakh and Gollum.

304
00:30:19,529 --> 00:30:23,795
- Untie us, my precious.
- I said to be quiet!

305
00:30:24,934 --> 00:30:28,267
Wait. You can't find it without our help.

306
00:30:28,671 --> 00:30:30,798
You help me?

307
00:31:33,736 --> 00:31:36,603
I don't know what to do now.
I don't even know where we are.

308
00:31:36,672 --> 00:31:39,903
You should have studied maps more
and played less in Rivendell.

309
00:31:39,976 --> 00:31:41,807
This is Fangorn Forest.

310
00:31:42,645 --> 00:31:45,341
Then we're no safer
than we were with the Orcs.

311
00:31:45,615 --> 00:31:50,018
We've no blankets and almost no food.
It looks like nothing to eat for 100 miles.

312
00:31:51,387 --> 00:31:53,617
We don't even know
where we're trying to go.

313
00:31:53,689 --> 00:31:55,247
Let's climb up there.

314
00:31:55,458 --> 00:31:58,052
Maybe we can find out
where we are, at least.

315
00:32:07,637 --> 00:32:09,400
It's nice here.

316
00:32:10,673 --> 00:32:13,369
The forest looks so different
in the sunlight.

317
00:32:13,443 --> 00:32:14,432
I know.

318
00:32:15,111 --> 00:32:18,547
It's funny, but, well,
I almost feel I like the place.

319
00:32:19,248 --> 00:32:22,809
Almost felt you liked the forest?

320
00:32:23,553 --> 00:32:27,387
That's uncommonly kind of you.

321
00:32:29,525 --> 00:32:31,857
The Orcs made us run here,
and when we tired...

322
00:32:31,928 --> 00:32:35,728
...they carried us, cut our ropes, ran into
the forest and we came to your hill...

323
00:32:35,798 --> 00:32:36,765
"Hill?"

324
00:32:39,068 --> 00:32:41,093
A hasty word...

325
00:32:41,737 --> 00:32:47,300
...for something that has stood here
since the world was shaped.

326
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:53,115
You may call me Treebeard.

327
00:32:53,416 --> 00:32:55,884
We thought you were a tree,
standing there.

328
00:32:56,152 --> 00:32:59,918
Not a tree, a tree herder.

329
00:33:00,389 --> 00:33:02,584
Please, Treebeard...

330
00:33:03,059 --> 00:33:04,993
...now that you know our story...

331
00:33:05,862 --> 00:33:07,329
...whose side are you on?

332
00:33:07,396 --> 00:33:10,854
I am not altogether on anybody's side...

333
00:33:11,334 --> 00:33:15,293
...because nobody is altogether on my side.

334
00:33:15,638 --> 00:33:18,072
But I am no friend of these...

335
00:33:18,174 --> 00:33:22,167
...tree-killing Orcs and their masters.

336
00:33:32,788 --> 00:33:35,188
They were here, no doubt of it.

337
00:33:35,758 --> 00:33:39,455
- But where they went?
- I don't understand these other marks.

338
00:33:40,530 --> 00:33:41,189
Look!

339
00:33:44,333 --> 00:33:46,426
Your bow, Legolas! It's Saruman.

340
00:33:46,502 --> 00:33:48,732
Shoot before he puts a spell on us, fast!

341
00:33:48,804 --> 00:33:49,793
Elf...

342
00:33:50,106 --> 00:33:53,633
...Man and Dwarf together?

343
00:33:54,343 --> 00:33:56,470
A rare sight in these times.

344
00:33:56,946 --> 00:33:58,709
Stop him, Legolas!

345
00:34:09,458 --> 00:34:10,755
Gandalf?

346
00:34:11,494 --> 00:34:13,928
Beyond all hope.

347
00:34:14,864 --> 00:34:16,263
Gandalf!

348
00:34:16,365 --> 00:34:17,354
Yes.

349
00:34:18,467 --> 00:34:20,458
That was my name.

350
00:34:21,637 --> 00:34:24,538
But where have you... Gandalf!

351
00:34:25,508 --> 00:34:26,770
What happened?

352
00:34:27,076 --> 00:34:28,941
A long time I fell.

353
00:34:30,246 --> 00:34:32,840
Long I fell and he fell with me.

354
00:34:33,282 --> 00:34:35,079
His fire was about me.

355
00:34:35,351 --> 00:34:36,716
I was burned.

356
00:34:37,053 --> 00:34:41,285
Ever he clutched me, and ever
I hewed him, far under the living earth...

357
00:34:41,457 --> 00:34:45,587
...until at last, he fled back
up the secret ways of Moria.

358
00:34:45,995 --> 00:34:49,396
There we fought,
above the mists of the world...

359
00:34:49,498 --> 00:34:52,296
...and the mountain was wreathed
with lightning.

360
00:34:52,501 --> 00:34:57,666
I threw down my enemy
and his fall broke the mountainside.

361
00:34:59,375 --> 00:35:01,673
Then darkness took me...

362
00:35:01,944 --> 00:35:05,380
...and I wandered far,
on roads that I will not tell.

363
00:35:06,582 --> 00:35:09,073
Naked, I was sent back for a brief time...

364
00:35:09,151 --> 00:35:10,982
...until my task was done.

365
00:35:11,587 --> 00:35:13,521
And it is time I was about it.

366
00:35:13,956 --> 00:35:18,859
You come with me to Edoras, my friends,
to the city of the Riders?

367
00:35:19,695 --> 00:35:21,287
To Edoras, now?

368
00:35:23,232 --> 00:35:25,223
But to leave Merry and Pippin?

369
00:35:25,301 --> 00:35:27,861
They are in no danger, believe me.

370
00:35:28,404 --> 00:35:30,463
The great danger is to Edoras.

371
00:35:30,539 --> 00:35:35,943
Saruman's Orcs will attack there within
two days, and Theoden has need of us.

372
00:35:36,979 --> 00:35:38,640
Theoden has grown old.

373
00:35:39,248 --> 00:35:41,512
He shivers by his fire now...

374
00:35:41,584 --> 00:35:44,951
...and leaves everything in the hands
of his new minister:

375
00:35:45,454 --> 00:35:47,684
Grima Wormtongue.

376
00:35:48,157 --> 00:35:51,285
Those Riders you followed,
who rescued Merry and Pippin...

377
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:53,658
...they were led by Theoden's nephew,
Eomer.

378
00:35:54,397 --> 00:35:57,389
He is all but an outlaw
in Rohan these days.

379
00:35:57,466 --> 00:35:59,798
He hunts the Orcs
wherever he finds them...

380
00:35:59,869 --> 00:36:03,066
...defying Wormtongue's orders
to let them pass.

381
00:36:03,139 --> 00:36:07,132
So Wormtongue calls him traitor
and renegade...

382
00:36:07,209 --> 00:36:08,733
...and Theoden believes...

383
00:36:08,811 --> 00:36:12,747
Gandalf, the Riders of Rohan
are the bravest fighters I've ever knew...

384
00:36:12,815 --> 00:36:14,510
...but they were never many.

385
00:36:14,684 --> 00:36:18,950
If Saruman strikes now,
he'll overrun Edoras in a single night.

386
00:36:23,826 --> 00:36:25,623
Our time is at hand.

387
00:36:26,495 --> 00:36:30,659
Theoden's hundreds will face
your tens of thousands.

388
00:36:34,303 --> 00:36:38,330
When all of Rohan, your ancient oppressor,
lies vanquished...

389
00:36:38,574 --> 00:36:41,042
...then shall we fly eastward...

390
00:36:41,177 --> 00:36:45,409
...and sweep all of Middle-earth
beneath our feet.

391
00:36:45,681 --> 00:36:48,206
We cannot be defeated!

392
00:36:58,194 --> 00:37:04,155
Halfway between Edoras and Isengard,
there lies a fortress called Helm's Deep.

393
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:07,000
If we can decoy Saruman's Orcs there...

394
00:37:07,069 --> 00:37:10,971
...the fortress will stop them longer
than the wooden halls of Edoras.

395
00:37:11,273 --> 00:37:13,764
We are buying time, Aragorn.

396
00:37:13,843 --> 00:37:15,902
Time? Time for what?

397
00:37:15,978 --> 00:37:17,502
Perhaps for a miracle.

398
00:37:18,013 --> 00:37:21,414
Perhaps only for Frodo
to get a little further on his way...

399
00:37:21,484 --> 00:37:24,214
...while the armies
that should be hunting for the Ring...

400
00:37:24,286 --> 00:37:27,016
...waste their own time destroying us.

401
00:37:37,967 --> 00:37:39,059
I have returned.

402
00:37:39,268 --> 00:37:43,864
The storm comes swiftly, and it is time
for all friends to gather together.

403
00:37:45,374 --> 00:37:47,399
And do you...

404
00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:51,746
...expect me to welcome you here...

405
00:37:52,381 --> 00:37:53,939
...Master Gandalf?

406
00:37:55,151 --> 00:37:58,245
Troubles follow you like crows.

407
00:37:58,654 --> 00:38:02,681
Why should I welcome you,
Gandalf Stormcrow?

408
00:38:03,058 --> 00:38:04,685
Justly spoken, Lord.

409
00:38:05,427 --> 00:38:07,895
In the east, the Dark Lord is stirring...

410
00:38:08,097 --> 00:38:12,466
...in Lorien, the Sorceress
of the Golden Wood weaves deceit.

411
00:38:12,535 --> 00:38:17,234
And such is the hour
in which this wanderer chooses to return.

412
00:38:18,707 --> 00:38:21,767
It is I who counsel the King now.

413
00:38:22,011 --> 00:38:23,706
He hears you no longer.

414
00:38:23,946 --> 00:38:25,777
No, Grima Wormtongue.

415
00:38:26,348 --> 00:38:30,341
He hears nothing but your voice
telling him that he rules here...

416
00:38:30,452 --> 00:38:33,148
...only because Saruman
is kind to old men...

417
00:38:33,389 --> 00:38:36,517
...and that the best thing for a sickly,
feeble king...

418
00:38:36,692 --> 00:38:40,651
...is to let Wizards and Orcs
do as they will in Rohan.

419
00:38:41,063 --> 00:38:44,555
I am my own man, Gandalf...

420
00:38:45,968 --> 00:38:47,401
...as I was.

421
00:38:49,038 --> 00:38:50,733
It is true that...

422
00:38:51,273 --> 00:38:55,266
...Grima advises me often
to leave Aruman in peace...

423
00:38:56,378 --> 00:38:58,539
Hear, my Lord, you tire yourself.

424
00:38:58,781 --> 00:39:00,373
You are still unwell.

425
00:39:00,516 --> 00:39:04,714
And he does remind me
that it would be safest for Rohan...

426
00:39:04,787 --> 00:39:06,448
...to seek their friendship...

427
00:39:06,522 --> 00:39:08,149
...no matter how I may feel!

428
00:39:08,224 --> 00:39:11,682
Dear Lord, let me deal with
these troublesome guests.

429
00:39:12,394 --> 00:39:15,090
How long has it been, Grima Wormtongue?

430
00:39:15,764 --> 00:39:18,961
How long since Saruman bought you?

431
00:39:19,802 --> 00:39:21,997
For I saw you at Isengard.

432
00:39:24,406 --> 00:39:27,603
Did I not counsel your doorkeeper
to forbid his staff?

433
00:39:28,944 --> 00:39:31,469
Down, snake.

434
00:39:32,147 --> 00:39:34,274
Down on your belly.

435
00:39:36,919 --> 00:39:38,944
Grima is often...

436
00:39:39,622 --> 00:39:44,025
...at Isengard.
I sent him there with messages.

437
00:39:44,226 --> 00:39:46,524
And he returns with poison...

438
00:39:47,162 --> 00:39:50,290
...Aruman's poison in your ears, Theoden.

439
00:39:50,399 --> 00:39:52,799
Chilling your heart, making you old.

440
00:39:52,868 --> 00:39:55,564
Take courage, Lord of Rohan!

441
00:39:56,138 --> 00:39:56,866
Grima...

442
00:39:58,841 --> 00:40:00,206
...is this so?

443
00:40:01,076 --> 00:40:03,510
I will not harm you, Grima.

444
00:40:05,014 --> 00:40:06,481
Is it so?

445
00:40:17,893 --> 00:40:19,190
Let him go!

446
00:40:22,631 --> 00:40:26,260
My sister-daughter, Eowyn.

447
00:40:27,636 --> 00:40:29,570
My only loyal kin...

448
00:40:29,638 --> 00:40:33,267
...since her brother has disobeyed
my commands.

449
00:40:33,342 --> 00:40:36,004
Wormtongue's command, Theoden.

450
00:40:36,512 --> 00:40:40,073
If Eomer had not defied him,
their cause might be already lost.

451
00:40:40,649 --> 00:40:42,640
Tell me, Gandalf...

452
00:40:43,218 --> 00:40:44,810
...what I must do now.

453
00:40:45,955 --> 00:40:48,423
We cannot wait here for Saruman's attack.

454
00:40:48,557 --> 00:40:51,219
Every man that can ride
must be sent immediately...

455
00:40:51,293 --> 00:40:53,591
...to the old fortress of Helm's Deep.

456
00:40:55,130 --> 00:40:57,394
When Saruman learns
that we have gone there...

457
00:40:57,566 --> 00:40:58,863
...and he will...

458
00:40:59,134 --> 00:41:01,329
...we will have the Riders of Rohan.

459
00:41:01,971 --> 00:41:04,337
I will find Eomer and his Riders.

460
00:41:04,873 --> 00:41:06,033
My armor!

461
00:41:29,031 --> 00:41:31,158
Look for me at Helm's Deep.

462
00:41:31,867 --> 00:41:33,562
That's all, Theoden.

463
00:41:42,811 --> 00:41:44,403
And he's gone again...

464
00:41:44,847 --> 00:41:46,678
...like a wind in the grass.

465
00:41:47,249 --> 00:41:49,012
Stormcrow.

466
00:41:50,652 --> 00:41:52,711
- Aragorn?
- My Lord?

467
00:41:52,888 --> 00:41:54,879
Is there any hope for us?

468
00:42:34,563 --> 00:42:37,589
Sam, you simpleminded...

469
00:42:38,033 --> 00:42:39,330
You fell asleep.

470
00:42:41,336 --> 00:42:43,327
Mr. Frodo, he's gone.

471
00:42:43,939 --> 00:42:47,272
- Smeagol?
- He's gone. I didn't mean to sleep.

472
00:42:48,143 --> 00:42:51,271
Well, he'll come back.
Promise will hold him a while yet.

473
00:42:51,814 --> 00:42:54,214
He won't leave his precious, anyway.

474
00:42:55,350 --> 00:42:56,578
Are we rested?

475
00:42:58,320 --> 00:42:59,582
Ready to go on?

476
00:43:01,156 --> 00:43:02,885
Nice Hobbitses.

477
00:43:04,226 --> 00:43:06,285
Trust Smeagol now?

478
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:26,377
Stop!

479
00:43:28,016 --> 00:43:29,415
Shivery light.

480
00:43:29,485 --> 00:43:32,283
Nasty.

481
00:43:32,588 --> 00:43:33,350
Look!

482
00:43:39,628 --> 00:43:40,925
Wraiths!

483
00:43:41,897 --> 00:43:46,925
Wraiths on wings!
The precious is calling them!

484
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:15,553
Gollum, wait, Mr. Frodo can't keep up!
Slow down, I tell you.

485
00:44:16,198 --> 00:44:18,393
No time, no time.

486
00:44:19,067 --> 00:44:21,535
The precious is heavy, yes.

487
00:44:22,304 --> 00:44:25,637
Very heavy, Smeagol knows.

488
00:44:26,275 --> 00:44:29,733
If it's too heavy for nice Master...

489
00:44:30,078 --> 00:44:32,273
...little Smeagol will carry it.

490
00:44:32,648 --> 00:44:34,479
Smeagol doesn't mind.

491
00:44:34,883 --> 00:44:37,147
Give it to Smeagol.

492
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:39,217
Do not say that again.

493
00:44:39,855 --> 00:44:40,947
Do not think it.

494
00:44:41,690 --> 00:44:44,124
Before you touched the precious again,
Smeagol...

495
00:44:44,193 --> 00:44:47,754
...I would put it on and have you
leap off a cliff, or into a fire...

496
00:44:47,863 --> 00:44:50,127
...and you would do it, Smeagol.

497
00:44:51,733 --> 00:44:55,469
Nice, Master.

498
00:44:56,638 --> 00:44:57,502
Gollum!

499
00:45:16,858 --> 00:45:18,155
Smeagol promised.

500
00:45:18,227 --> 00:45:23,028
Yes, we promised to save our precious,
never to let him have it...

501
00:45:23,098 --> 00:45:24,827
...but it's going to him...

502
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:28,529
...my precious is nearer every step.

503
00:45:29,137 --> 00:45:32,664
I can't help it.
Smeagol promised to help nice Hobbit.

504
00:45:32,741 --> 00:45:37,041
He took cruel rope off our leg.
He speaks nicely to me.

505
00:45:37,913 --> 00:45:41,110
He's a Baggins, my precious.
A Baggins stoled it.

506
00:45:41,183 --> 00:45:43,617
We hates Bagginses.

507
00:45:43,885 --> 00:45:47,116
Must have the precious. Must have it.

508
00:45:47,422 --> 00:45:50,391
We wants it.

509
00:45:50,993 --> 00:45:52,688
But there's two of them.

510
00:45:53,762 --> 00:45:55,161
Yes.

511
00:45:55,697 --> 00:45:59,963
We needs help, precious.
She might help, yes.

512
00:46:00,636 --> 00:46:02,900
She might help us...

513
00:46:03,705 --> 00:46:07,163
...but Smeagol promised nice Hobbit.

514
00:46:11,813 --> 00:46:13,110
Nice Hobbit.

515
00:46:14,216 --> 00:46:15,342
Hey, you...

516
00:46:16,285 --> 00:46:18,412
...what are you pawing at him for?

517
00:46:18,687 --> 00:46:22,179
Where've you been anyway,
sneaking off and sneaking back?

518
00:46:24,326 --> 00:46:27,591
"Sneaking?"

519
00:46:28,897 --> 00:46:31,593
Hobbit's always so polite, yes.

520
00:46:31,933 --> 00:46:35,892
Tired, thirsty Smeagol, he finds
a secret way through the mountain...

521
00:46:35,971 --> 00:46:40,374
...a tunnel with no Orcses anywhere,
and they say "sneak."

522
00:46:40,742 --> 00:46:42,004
"Sneak?"

523
00:46:43,312 --> 00:46:46,475
Well, you startled me. I'm sorry.

524
00:46:49,618 --> 00:46:50,880
Hello, Smeagol.

525
00:46:51,787 --> 00:46:53,755
- Where have you been?
- Sneaking!

526
00:47:09,104 --> 00:47:10,833
I like this place.

527
00:47:11,373 --> 00:47:13,466
There is good rock here.

528
00:47:13,608 --> 00:47:16,304
This country has tough bones.

529
00:47:34,830 --> 00:47:38,698
Up on the ridge! They're coming!
There they are!

530
00:52:06,434 --> 00:52:08,163
Fire of Isengard!

531
00:52:13,775 --> 00:52:16,801
We're breached! Retreat to the caves!

532
00:52:17,312 --> 00:52:18,745
The caves!

533
00:53:52,874 --> 00:53:54,865
Theoden King.

534
00:53:55,810 --> 00:53:57,437
I will not end here...

535
00:53:58,179 --> 00:54:00,477
...taken like an old badger in a trap.

536
00:54:01,049 --> 00:54:02,448
When dawn comes...

537
00:54:03,351 --> 00:54:06,047
...I will bid men sound Helm's horn...

538
00:54:06,354 --> 00:54:08,185
...and I will ride forth.

539
00:54:08,957 --> 00:54:12,415
Will you ride with me then,
son of Arathorn?

540
00:54:12,961 --> 00:54:15,862
At least, we may make such an end...

541
00:54:16,498 --> 00:54:17,965
...as will be worth a song.

542
00:54:20,301 --> 00:54:21,825
I will ride with you.

543
00:54:31,846 --> 00:54:33,211
We're there, Sam.

544
00:54:33,882 --> 00:54:35,645
Another day, maybe two.

545
00:54:35,717 --> 00:54:38,413
When light comes tomorrow,
the mountains will be near.

546
00:54:38,486 --> 00:54:43,150
Well, it's a good thing, Mr. Frodo,
because we're running awful low on food.

547
00:54:43,625 --> 00:54:47,152
I reckon we've got enough left
to see us to this Mount Doom.

548
00:54:47,529 --> 00:54:48,962
After that...

549
00:54:49,164 --> 00:54:50,426
...I don't know.

550
00:54:54,569 --> 00:54:56,196
Samwise Gamgee.

551
00:54:56,738 --> 00:54:58,137
My dearest Hobbit...

552
00:54:58,373 --> 00:55:00,136
...friend of friends...

553
00:55:00,809 --> 00:55:04,472
..."after that," if the Ring goes
into the fire, and we are at hand?

554
00:55:04,546 --> 00:55:06,343
"After that," dear Sam.

555
00:55:06,714 --> 00:55:07,772
I wouldn't worry.

556
00:55:08,483 --> 00:55:09,973
Just to get there.

557
00:55:10,351 --> 00:55:12,114
Just to get there.

558
00:55:12,587 --> 00:55:14,817
The Ring is so heavy now, Sam.

559
00:55:27,635 --> 00:55:30,229
We must go.

560
00:55:30,705 --> 00:55:33,173
Mustn't rest here, silly Hobbits.

561
00:55:33,942 --> 00:55:36,809
Orcs find us. Ring wraiths find us.

562
00:55:37,078 --> 00:55:40,309
Must go on to safe, secret place.

563
00:55:40,782 --> 00:55:42,841
Smeagol's secret way!

564
00:55:43,284 --> 00:55:44,808
The straight stair...

565
00:55:45,053 --> 00:55:47,920
...and the winding stair.

566
00:55:48,323 --> 00:55:49,722
Up, up...

567
00:55:50,558 --> 00:55:53,425
...through black, sharp mountains.

568
00:55:54,529 --> 00:55:55,826
Follow good Smeagol.

569
00:56:14,315 --> 00:56:16,875
Straight stair, winding stair?

570
00:56:17,352 --> 00:56:18,944
What comes after that?

571
00:56:19,888 --> 00:56:22,379
We shall see, yes...

572
00:56:23,458 --> 00:56:24,823
...we shall see.

573
01:00:37,011 --> 01:00:39,070
Gandalf!

574
01:01:45,513 --> 01:01:49,779
The forces of darkness were driven
forever from the face of Middle-earth...

575
01:01:49,850 --> 01:01:52,512
...by the valiant friends of Frodo.

576
01:01:52,687 --> 01:01:54,917
As their gallant battle ended...

577
01:01:55,056 --> 01:01:57,923
...so too ends the first great tale of...

578
01:01:58,359 --> 01:02:00,919
...The Lord of the Rings.

579
