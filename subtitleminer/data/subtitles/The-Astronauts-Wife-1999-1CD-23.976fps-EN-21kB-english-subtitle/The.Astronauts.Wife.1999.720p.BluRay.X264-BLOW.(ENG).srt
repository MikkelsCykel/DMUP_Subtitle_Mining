1
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,553
I hate this part.

2
00:00:36,637 --> 00:00:39,640
You're still here, but I know
you're going, and I hate that.

3
00:00:39,681 --> 00:00:42,768
Well, I'll call you, baby.

4
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:44,937
Don't tease me.

5
00:00:48,232 --> 00:00:51,068
I miss you so much
when you're gone.

6
00:00:51,109 --> 00:00:53,862
I miss you, too, baby.

7
00:00:53,904 --> 00:00:55,531
Listen.

8
00:00:55,572 --> 00:00:57,449
Last time Streck told me...

9
00:00:57,491 --> 00:00:59,201
if I bellyached about you
for one more minute...

10
00:00:59,243 --> 00:01:02,454
he was gonna toss my ass
right off the ship.

11
00:01:02,496 --> 00:01:07,793
You tell Streck
your ass belongs to me...

12
00:01:07,834 --> 00:01:10,379
and he can keep
his hands off it.

13
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:11,880
All right.

14
00:01:14,216 --> 00:01:17,177
My class wants you
to come by when you get back.

15
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:22,266
I think I can arrange a visit...

16
00:01:22,307 --> 00:01:24,059
if you're nice.

17
00:01:26,353 --> 00:01:27,938
How nice?

18
00:01:33,277 --> 00:01:34,778
You like fruit?

19
00:01:40,534 --> 00:01:42,035
Well...

20
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:46,290
Come here a minute.

21
00:01:46,331 --> 00:01:47,916
Come here.

22
00:01:49,501 --> 00:01:50,961
Ain't that a peach?

23
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:55,215
Is that for me?

24
00:01:55,257 --> 00:01:56,425
That's for you.

25
00:01:57,968 --> 00:02:00,387
Victory,
this is Mission Control.

26
00:02:00,429 --> 00:02:01,763
All systems are go.

27
00:02:01,805 --> 00:02:03,974
Flight Commander,
all computers are functioning.

28
00:02:04,016 --> 00:02:05,309
The crew of Victory...

29
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:07,144
has been given a go
for orbit operations...

30
00:02:07,186 --> 00:02:08,520
by the Mission Control Center.

31
00:02:08,562 --> 00:02:10,647
Crew members are doing well...

32
00:02:10,689 --> 00:02:13,734
and all systems of the orbiter
are performing satisfactorily.

33
00:02:13,775 --> 00:02:14,943
Three...

34
00:02:14,985 --> 00:02:16,320
two...

35
00:02:16,361 --> 00:02:17,654
one...

36
00:02:17,696 --> 00:02:19,656
zero, and lift off.

37
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:24,119
Mission Control,
we have left the pad.

38
00:02:24,161 --> 00:02:25,287
Roger that, Victory.

39
00:02:25,329 --> 00:02:28,248
You are go for throttle up.

40
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:29,541
Mission Control,
this is Victory.

41
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:30,709
We have throttled up.

42
00:02:30,751 --> 00:02:32,878
It's a fine day for flying,
Houston.

43
00:02:34,504 --> 00:02:36,715
All systems are go.

44
00:02:44,723 --> 00:02:46,683
Pineapples!

45
00:02:46,767 --> 00:02:49,102
What do they have in Kansas?

46
00:02:49,144 --> 00:02:50,729
Corn!

47
00:02:50,771 --> 00:02:55,192
Yes, corn,
and what about Georgia?

48
00:02:55,234 --> 00:02:56,860
What do they have in Georgia?

49
00:02:56,902 --> 00:02:58,362
Peaches!

50
00:02:58,403 --> 00:03:00,822
Very good.

51
00:03:00,864 --> 00:03:03,075
And what do we have
here in Florida?

52
00:03:03,116 --> 00:03:05,953
Oranges!

53
00:03:05,994 --> 00:03:08,372
And rocket ships.

54
00:03:08,413 --> 00:03:11,375
Yes, Calvin, and rocket ships.

55
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:14,086
Mrs. Armacost,
you have a phone call.

56
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:15,712
Thank you, Brian.

57
00:03:15,754 --> 00:03:17,381
OK, let's go to page seven.

58
00:03:17,422 --> 00:03:20,384
And work quietly, OK?

59
00:03:24,513 --> 00:03:26,223
Mrs. Armacost.

60
00:03:26,265 --> 00:03:28,058
Yes, this is Jillian Armacost.

61
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:30,394
Mrs. Armacost,
NASA communications.

62
00:03:30,435 --> 00:03:32,604
We have your husband for you.

63
00:03:32,646 --> 00:03:34,398
Go ahead, Commander.

64
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:36,692
- Jillian?
- Spencer?

65
00:03:36,733 --> 00:03:37,943
Yeah, I told you I'd call.

66
00:03:37,985 --> 00:03:39,528
It's amazing, isn't it?

67
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:41,113
Yes, amazing.

68
00:03:41,154 --> 00:03:42,656
Hey, Jill.

69
00:03:45,242 --> 00:03:46,410
What are you wearing?

70
00:03:49,288 --> 00:03:52,165
Come on, now.
Ain't nobody else listening.

71
00:03:52,207 --> 00:03:53,625
Not exactly, Commander.

72
00:03:53,667 --> 00:03:55,294
Including Houston and J.P.L...

73
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:57,838
there are about 300 folks
on the line today.

74
00:03:58,881 --> 00:04:01,049
It's a nice day down there, huh?

75
00:04:01,091 --> 00:04:02,593
Beautiful.

76
00:04:02,634 --> 00:04:05,053
Can you see outside, Jill?

77
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:09,600
Fifteen seconds, Commander.

78
00:04:09,683 --> 00:04:11,435
I'm right above you.

79
00:04:13,812 --> 00:04:15,272
You looking up, honey?

80
00:04:15,314 --> 00:04:17,232
Ten seconds.

81
00:04:17,274 --> 00:04:20,444
Won't you smile for me, huh?

82
00:04:20,485 --> 00:04:21,987
I already am.

83
00:04:23,655 --> 00:04:26,283
He called you from outer space?

84
00:04:26,325 --> 00:04:29,077
Well, technically
from Earth's orbit, but yes.

85
00:04:29,119 --> 00:04:30,329
He called me from the orbiter.

86
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:33,332
Stanley won't even call me
from the Beef'N' Burger...

87
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:36,001
and you get a call
from outer space...

88
00:04:36,043 --> 00:04:38,003
the Earth's orbit, whatever.

89
00:04:38,045 --> 00:04:39,922
Technically speaking,
Jill, you scored.

90
00:04:39,963 --> 00:04:42,507
I don't get it.
We grew up in the same house.

91
00:04:42,549 --> 00:04:43,759
You land Johnny Rocket Boy.

92
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,927
I keep getting
different versions...

93
00:04:44,968 --> 00:04:47,095
of Throws-Up-On-Himself Elmo.

94
00:04:48,472 --> 00:04:51,141
I bet he's good at the little
things, too, isn't he?

95
00:04:51,183 --> 00:04:54,353
What little things?

96
00:04:54,394 --> 00:04:57,439
Just those little things
that mean so much.

97
00:04:57,481 --> 00:04:58,941
It's true.

98
00:04:58,982 --> 00:05:01,735
You know,
men are like parking spaces.

99
00:05:01,777 --> 00:05:02,903
All the good ones are taken...

100
00:05:02,945 --> 00:05:05,531
and all the available ones
are handicapped.

101
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:09,952
What?

102
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:18,919
And now back to our program.

103
00:05:18,961 --> 00:05:20,963
Oh, man, something happened.

104
00:05:21,004 --> 00:05:22,381
Come on.

105
00:05:26,885 --> 00:05:28,220
Keep checking.

106
00:05:30,597 --> 00:05:33,225
Mrs. Armacost,
I'm Sherman Reese from NASA.

107
00:05:33,267 --> 00:05:35,519
Um, it's about your husband.

108
00:05:35,602 --> 00:05:36,854
What's happened?

109
00:05:36,937 --> 00:05:38,188
We'd like you to come with us.

110
00:05:38,272 --> 00:05:39,773
I have a car right outside.

111
00:05:39,815 --> 00:05:41,692
There's something about Spencer!

112
00:05:41,775 --> 00:05:43,110
Please, Mrs. Armacost.

113
00:05:43,151 --> 00:05:44,736
Captain Streck's wife
is already there.

114
00:05:44,778 --> 00:05:46,613
The director wants...

115
00:05:46,655 --> 00:05:49,199
The condition of Armacost
and Streck...

116
00:05:49,241 --> 00:05:51,076
as well as the rest
of the shuttle crew...

117
00:05:51,118 --> 00:05:52,661
is at this time unknown.

118
00:05:52,703 --> 00:05:54,454
Reporting live from NASA...

119
00:05:54,496 --> 00:05:55,998
Is my husband dead?

120
00:05:56,039 --> 00:05:57,666
Ma'am, I don't know anything...

121
00:05:57,708 --> 00:05:59,084
about the condition
of your husband.

122
00:05:59,126 --> 00:06:00,294
Is my husband dead?

123
00:06:00,335 --> 00:06:03,422
Ma'am, I just don't know.

124
00:06:03,463 --> 00:06:06,300
Then take me
to someone who does.

125
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:20,606
He's dead.

126
00:06:20,647 --> 00:06:21,982
I know he's dead.

127
00:06:22,024 --> 00:06:24,776
They're not dead.
They're not dead.

128
00:06:26,153 --> 00:06:28,947
What have they told you?

129
00:06:28,989 --> 00:06:30,240
Nothing.

130
00:06:30,282 --> 00:06:31,700
They won't tell me anything.

131
00:06:34,369 --> 00:06:35,954
Mrs. Streck, Mrs. Armacost.

132
00:06:35,996 --> 00:06:39,291
First, your husbands are alive.

133
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:40,459
Oh, thank God.

134
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,835
They're back on the orbiter
right now...

135
00:06:41,877 --> 00:06:44,963
and we're gonna bring'em down
immediately.

136
00:06:45,005 --> 00:06:46,215
What happened up there?

137
00:06:46,256 --> 00:06:48,008
Your husbands were
outside the orbiter...

138
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:50,844
performing some repairs
on a satellite.

139
00:06:50,886 --> 00:06:52,012
There was an explosion...

140
00:06:52,054 --> 00:06:55,933
and we lost contact
with both astronauts...

141
00:06:55,974 --> 00:06:57,851
for about two minutes.

142
00:06:57,893 --> 00:07:00,103
You lost contact?

143
00:07:01,146 --> 00:07:02,689
What do you mean
you lost contact?

144
00:07:02,731 --> 00:07:05,776
After the explosion,
they drifted behind the shuttle.

145
00:07:05,817 --> 00:07:07,819
We had to bring
the craft around...

146
00:07:07,861 --> 00:07:09,488
a hundred and eighty degrees
to get them.

147
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:10,656
They were all alone?

148
00:07:10,697 --> 00:07:12,699
But now they're back
on the shuttle...

149
00:07:12,741 --> 00:07:15,911
and they'll be back down here
as soon as we can manage it.

150
00:07:15,953 --> 00:07:18,205
Mr. Reese here
will stay with you...

151
00:07:18,247 --> 00:07:19,831
until we can get you to them.

152
00:07:23,877 --> 00:07:26,088
They were all alone out there,
Jillian.

153
00:07:29,508 --> 00:07:31,009
It's OK.

154
00:07:31,051 --> 00:07:32,386
They're alive.

155
00:07:32,427 --> 00:07:36,723
This will give you a view
from the shuttle as they land.

156
00:07:36,765 --> 00:07:39,017
Would you like me
to get you the link-up?

157
00:07:39,059 --> 00:07:41,061
I'll get the link-up.

158
00:07:57,202 --> 00:08:00,414
Twenty-five seconds
to reentry interface.

159
00:08:03,792 --> 00:08:05,419
Maintain descent.

160
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:11,133
Wind shear-
this is minimum trajectory.

161
00:08:13,343 --> 00:08:16,430
Velocity at
twenty-six hundred F.B.P.

162
00:08:19,141 --> 00:08:21,059
At two hundred
thirty-five knots...

163
00:08:21,101 --> 00:08:22,436
maintaining descent.

164
00:08:23,812 --> 00:08:25,772
Eight at two-fifteen...

165
00:08:25,814 --> 00:08:27,816
five at two-ten...

166
00:08:27,858 --> 00:08:29,818
two at two hundred.

167
00:08:31,486 --> 00:08:33,155
One foot.

168
00:08:33,197 --> 00:08:35,073
Ground Control, this is Victory.

169
00:08:35,115 --> 00:08:36,450
We are down.

170
00:08:36,533 --> 00:08:38,452
He's breathing on his own.

171
00:08:38,493 --> 00:08:39,786
His vital functions are good.

172
00:08:39,828 --> 00:08:42,956
As far as we can tell, there has
been no brain damage...

173
00:08:42,998 --> 00:08:44,499
so it should only be
a matter of time...

174
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:46,501
before your husband
regains consciousness.

175
00:08:47,961 --> 00:08:49,963
- So he's going to be OK?
- Absolutely.

176
00:08:53,091 --> 00:08:54,384
And what about Alex?

177
00:08:54,426 --> 00:08:58,472
Captain Streck is an older man
than your husband.

178
00:08:58,513 --> 00:09:02,559
There was a tremendous strain
on his heart.

179
00:09:05,854 --> 00:09:07,147
Natalie.

180
00:09:42,724 --> 00:09:44,351
Hey, you.

181
00:09:55,863 --> 00:09:57,823
I missed you so much.

182
00:10:05,205 --> 00:10:07,040
How are you?

183
00:10:07,082 --> 00:10:08,375
I'm all right.

184
00:10:09,293 --> 00:10:10,586
Yeah, I'm all right.

185
00:10:10,627 --> 00:10:11,795
Good.

186
00:10:13,422 --> 00:10:14,715
I got to pee.

187
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:23,640
I'll see what I can do for you.

188
00:10:26,685 --> 00:10:27,853
Where's Alex?

189
00:10:30,939 --> 00:10:32,399
Is he all right?

190
00:10:49,499 --> 00:10:51,251
Spencer, what is that?

191
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:58,217
Did you feel that?

192
00:10:59,176 --> 00:11:01,261
My God, what is that?

193
00:11:01,303 --> 00:11:03,055
Honey, I'm here.

194
00:11:04,014 --> 00:11:06,308
God damn it!

195
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:07,518
What can I do?

196
00:11:11,355 --> 00:11:12,898
Jesus. Hold him.

197
00:11:18,445 --> 00:11:20,155
Help him!

198
00:11:42,386 --> 00:11:44,012
Clear!

199
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:49,184
That's it.
He's still at zero.

200
00:11:49,226 --> 00:11:51,144
Nothing.

201
00:11:51,186 --> 00:11:52,479
Charging, three hundred.

202
00:11:52,521 --> 00:11:54,147
Clear.

203
00:12:02,698 --> 00:12:03,782
We got him.

204
00:12:05,993 --> 00:12:07,786
Hold off on that intubator.

205
00:12:10,581 --> 00:12:12,708
Stand by with some dopamine.

206
00:12:12,749 --> 00:12:14,710
Let's get an EKG prepped.

207
00:12:31,226 --> 00:12:32,477
What did you say?

208
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:35,898
Well, I told that bloated
fast-food-eating motherfucker...

209
00:12:35,939 --> 00:12:38,483
that we'd never have gotten
a chance to be heroes...

210
00:12:38,525 --> 00:12:40,527
if he hadn't cut our budget
andforced us...

211
00:12:40,611 --> 00:12:43,197
to put that piece of shit
exploding satellite into orbit.

212
00:12:43,238 --> 00:12:44,406
Really?

213
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,700
And then what happened?

214
00:12:46,742 --> 00:12:49,912
Said he'd never been talked to
like that before by anybody...

215
00:12:49,953 --> 00:12:51,747
and I said I didn't give
a big hairy rat's ass...

216
00:12:51,788 --> 00:12:55,375
and if he ever called me again,
I would track him down...

217
00:12:55,417 --> 00:12:58,212
roust him out of his bunk, pull
his pants around his ankles...

218
00:12:58,253 --> 00:12:59,504
and spank him
with a coat hanger...

219
00:12:59,546 --> 00:13:01,506
right there in front of
his wife and children.

220
00:13:01,548 --> 00:13:02,799
Well, that's real subtle.

221
00:13:02,841 --> 00:13:05,928
Yeah, I thought it
pretty subtle.

222
00:13:05,969 --> 00:13:08,013
You want to tell me what you
really said to the president?

223
00:13:08,055 --> 00:13:11,099
Yeah.
I thanked him for his call.

224
00:13:11,141 --> 00:13:14,186
Then I asked him
what he was wearing...

225
00:13:14,228 --> 00:13:17,189
and he started breathing
kind of heavy...

226
00:13:17,231 --> 00:13:19,107
made a funny noise, and hung up.

227
00:13:19,149 --> 00:13:20,275
What do you think that means?

228
00:13:20,317 --> 00:13:21,485
Maybe he's not into you.

229
00:13:21,527 --> 00:13:22,694
I guess not.

230
00:13:22,736 --> 00:13:24,613
She got balloons.
Why didn't I get no balloons?

231
00:13:24,655 --> 00:13:25,781
Because you got candy.

232
00:13:25,822 --> 00:13:28,325
- Ý ain't got no candy.
- You got candy.

233
00:13:28,367 --> 00:13:30,827
- Where's my candy?
- Ýn the car.

234
00:13:31,995 --> 00:13:35,290
Does he ever talk about it?

235
00:13:35,332 --> 00:13:38,919
Did Spencer ever say anything
about what happened up there?

236
00:13:38,961 --> 00:13:41,922
What it was like
when they were alone?

237
00:13:43,674 --> 00:13:46,301
It's going to be OK.

238
00:13:46,343 --> 00:13:47,511
They're back.

239
00:13:49,721 --> 00:13:51,181
He doesn't talk about it,
does he?

240
00:13:52,808 --> 00:13:53,934
Neither does Alex.

241
00:13:53,976 --> 00:13:56,103
Never mentions it...

242
00:13:56,144 --> 00:13:57,604
not a word.

243
00:13:58,814 --> 00:14:00,065
Well, do you blame them?

244
00:14:05,445 --> 00:14:07,781
Those two minutes,
they almost died, Jillian.

245
00:14:07,823 --> 00:14:09,157
But they didn't.

246
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:10,826
But they almost did.

247
00:14:12,327 --> 00:14:14,329
To go through that together...

248
00:14:14,371 --> 00:14:16,206
to come back,
and never talk about it...

249
00:14:16,248 --> 00:14:18,834
never bring it up-
it's bizarre.

250
00:14:21,712 --> 00:14:23,130
It's over.

251
00:14:24,131 --> 00:14:25,299
Honey...

252
00:14:27,551 --> 00:14:29,887
I know this has to be hard
for you, too.

253
00:14:31,388 --> 00:14:36,101
It just scares me that they act
like it never happened.

254
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:42,816
There you go.

255
00:14:42,858 --> 00:14:45,027
- Thanks, Commander.
- You got it, buddy.

256
00:14:45,068 --> 00:14:46,987
Hey, Mike, what did he write?

257
00:14:48,739 --> 00:14:50,073
Guess what.

258
00:14:50,115 --> 00:14:51,283
What?

259
00:14:54,661 --> 00:14:56,663
I'm resigning from the service.

260
00:14:59,082 --> 00:15:00,751
Because of what happened?

261
00:15:00,792 --> 00:15:03,712
Well, it's because
I'm done up there.

262
00:15:05,464 --> 00:15:09,927
I got an offer
from an aerospace firm...

263
00:15:09,968 --> 00:15:11,428
executive position...

264
00:15:12,721 --> 00:15:14,681
lots of money.

265
00:15:14,723 --> 00:15:17,309
I mean boatloads of money, Jill.

266
00:15:17,351 --> 00:15:20,562
What do you know
about being an executive?

267
00:15:20,604 --> 00:15:21,939
You're a flier, Spence.

268
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:23,524
No, honey.

269
00:15:23,565 --> 00:15:26,276
What I am
is a true American hero.

270
00:15:26,318 --> 00:15:28,820
The president of
the United States said that...

271
00:15:28,862 --> 00:15:30,113
and you heard it.

272
00:15:32,449 --> 00:15:33,575
Anyway...

273
00:15:35,035 --> 00:15:37,287
Apparently,
it's pretty good for business...

274
00:15:37,329 --> 00:15:41,124
to have a true American hero
on the company letterhead.

275
00:15:44,378 --> 00:15:48,215
The thing of it is, Jill...

276
00:15:48,298 --> 00:15:51,134
is that the company
headquarters...

277
00:15:54,346 --> 00:15:56,348
it's in New York City.

278
00:15:57,850 --> 00:15:59,977
You're kidding, right?

279
00:16:00,018 --> 00:16:02,479
New York?

280
00:16:02,521 --> 00:16:04,481
You hate New York.

281
00:16:04,523 --> 00:16:05,774
Too many people, remember?

282
00:16:05,816 --> 00:16:07,150
I know.

283
00:16:10,362 --> 00:16:12,823
We have a life here, Spencer...

284
00:16:14,199 --> 00:16:16,243
my job, our friends, everything.

285
00:16:20,706 --> 00:16:23,083
So, what do you say?

286
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:24,626
Will you do it?

287
00:16:26,169 --> 00:16:30,257
Will you move
to New York City with me?

288
00:16:32,634 --> 00:16:35,137
You've always been there for me.

289
00:16:36,763 --> 00:16:39,099
I want to be there for you.

290
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:43,312
Let's go to New York.

291
00:16:45,105 --> 00:16:47,107
What do you say?

292
00:16:51,737 --> 00:16:53,197
Yes, Paula?

293
00:16:53,238 --> 00:16:56,783
When your husband is in space,
does he ever see God?

294
00:16:56,825 --> 00:16:59,953
What about aliens?
Does he see aliens?

295
00:16:59,995 --> 00:17:03,123
Does he bring a laser gun
in case there are aliens?

296
00:17:03,165 --> 00:17:04,958
If I were going,
I'd bring two laser guns...

297
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,336
a little one for my pocket
and a laser rifle.

298
00:17:07,377 --> 00:17:09,129
Does your husband
have a laser rifle?

299
00:17:09,171 --> 00:17:10,797
Does he get to bring it
home with him?

300
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:12,466
Does it work here
on Earth or only in space?

301
00:17:14,092 --> 00:17:15,219
You know what, Calvin?

302
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:16,803
What, Mrs. Armacost?

303
00:17:16,845 --> 00:17:18,722
I'm going to miss you.

304
00:17:28,106 --> 00:17:31,401
And so I face

305
00:17:31,443 --> 00:17:34,738
The final curtain

306
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:37,366
My friends

307
00:17:37,407 --> 00:17:40,244
I must say it clear

308
00:17:40,285 --> 00:17:43,288
I'll state my case

309
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:46,708
Of which I'm certain

310
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:49,253
I've lived

311
00:17:49,294 --> 00:17:51,380
A life that's full

312
00:17:51,463 --> 00:17:54,258
I traveled each

313
00:17:54,299 --> 00:17:55,425
Ain't the world incredible?

314
00:17:55,467 --> 00:17:58,178
And every highway

315
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:00,931
And more

316
00:18:00,973 --> 00:18:03,934
Much more than this

317
00:18:03,976 --> 00:18:05,269
He did it

318
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:10,357
His way

319
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:29,001
Thank you.

320
00:18:45,142 --> 00:18:47,811
To you, spaceman.

321
00:20:35,586 --> 00:20:36,837
Baby?

322
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:10,829
I have a brief
prepared statement...

323
00:21:10,871 --> 00:21:12,915
and then there will be time
for questions.

324
00:21:12,956 --> 00:21:16,960
Captain Alex Streck died
last night at eightfifty-five.

325
00:21:17,002 --> 00:21:18,170
The cause of death...

326
00:21:18,212 --> 00:21:20,505
has been determined
to have been a massive stroke...

327
00:21:20,547 --> 00:21:23,467
what the surgeons are calling
a severe insult to the brain.

328
00:21:23,508 --> 00:21:25,469
Alex was an asset
to this program...

329
00:21:25,511 --> 00:21:27,513
way beyond
his professional expertise.

330
00:21:27,554 --> 00:21:30,349
He will be missed terribly
by all of us.

331
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:31,850
There will be
a private ceremony.

332
00:21:34,144 --> 00:21:36,146
Is Commander Armacost
in any danger?

333
00:21:36,188 --> 00:21:38,607
I'll let Dr. Patraba
answer that.

334
00:21:40,567 --> 00:21:42,027
Commander Armacost
has been through...

335
00:21:42,069 --> 00:21:44,863
an intensive array
of examinations and tests.

336
00:21:44,905 --> 00:21:47,032
It is the opinion of myself
and my colleagues...

337
00:21:47,074 --> 00:21:50,702
that he's in no more danger
than any of us.

338
00:22:07,344 --> 00:22:09,096
I'm going to be over here, baby.

339
00:22:10,889 --> 00:22:12,057
You OK?

340
00:22:13,892 --> 00:22:15,018
Where's Natalie?

341
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:17,479
She's in the back.
She's been asking for you.

342
00:22:17,521 --> 00:22:19,982
OK. I'll see you in a bit, OK?

343
00:22:20,023 --> 00:22:22,025
- All right.
- OK.

344
00:22:52,306 --> 00:22:54,975
They talked to him every night.

345
00:22:56,518 --> 00:22:58,020
All the time.

346
00:23:01,648 --> 00:23:03,275
I couldn't understand them.

347
00:23:06,486 --> 00:23:08,488
Who talked to him, Natalie?

348
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:14,953
They did.

349
00:23:18,373 --> 00:23:19,917
They did, Jillian.

350
00:24:02,209 --> 00:24:04,127
He's hiding inside me.

351
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:22,437
I certainly do appreciate
your concern, Mr. Reese...

352
00:24:22,479 --> 00:24:25,858
but I have been probed and poked
by enough needles...

353
00:24:25,899 --> 00:24:27,860
and your superiors have given me
a clean bill of health.

354
00:24:27,901 --> 00:24:30,445
I know that, but, Commander, I-

355
00:24:30,487 --> 00:24:32,197
It's probably nothing, but...

356
00:24:32,239 --> 00:24:34,491
Do your bosses know
you want to do this?

357
00:24:52,593 --> 00:24:53,719
Oh, God.

358
00:25:21,246 --> 00:25:22,873
I'll be sure and let you know...

359
00:25:22,915 --> 00:25:24,875
of some good places
for you to shop.

360
00:25:24,917 --> 00:25:28,337
That dress is really sweet,
but it's not really appropriate.

361
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:32,216
You'll meet lots of interesting
people when you're here.

362
00:25:32,257 --> 00:25:34,384
They like
the sort of things I do.

363
00:25:34,426 --> 00:25:35,552
You can feel the first kick.

364
00:25:35,594 --> 00:25:38,931
Probably not quite
as interesting as me...

365
00:25:38,972 --> 00:25:40,766
but you're very lucky.
I, uh...

366
00:25:40,807 --> 00:25:44,937
But then she saw
the rocket boosters come on...

367
00:25:44,978 --> 00:25:47,898
and that's when you know...

368
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:49,608
that you're going somewhere
real fast.

369
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:51,610
- Zoom, zoom, zoom.
- That's right.

370
00:25:51,652 --> 00:25:55,322
I used to be into AIDS,
but now I'm into hunger.

371
00:25:59,159 --> 00:26:00,577
I teach.

372
00:26:00,619 --> 00:26:02,621
Oh, at the university?

373
00:26:03,747 --> 00:26:06,166
No, second grade.

374
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:08,835
I'm sorry. I thought you said
you taught second grade.

375
00:26:08,877 --> 00:26:10,087
Yes. I-

376
00:26:10,128 --> 00:26:12,422
Oh, Ambrose, hi.

377
00:26:12,464 --> 00:26:13,799
You look great.

378
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,133
Will you excuse me?

379
00:26:15,175 --> 00:26:16,802
Yeah, sure.

380
00:26:34,069 --> 00:26:35,571
Yeah, all right.

381
00:26:35,612 --> 00:26:37,114
Excuse me, Philip.

382
00:26:41,243 --> 00:26:43,036
Now, don't worry about her.

383
00:26:43,078 --> 00:26:46,999
Total lack of body fat has made
her something less than human.

384
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:49,459
I don't think she's had
her period in three years...

385
00:26:49,501 --> 00:26:50,878
which I guess is a blessing...

386
00:26:50,919 --> 00:26:53,338
for the gene pool,
wouldn't you say?

387
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:54,590
Shelly McLaren.

388
00:26:56,008 --> 00:26:57,509
Yeah, I know.

389
00:27:00,596 --> 00:27:01,722
Your husband must be...

390
00:27:01,763 --> 00:27:03,473
Jackson McLaren.

391
00:27:03,515 --> 00:27:05,809
They all had cigars...

392
00:27:05,851 --> 00:27:09,021
but Jackson had
the biggest cigar of all.

393
00:27:09,062 --> 00:27:10,480
Ah, here we go.

394
00:27:14,484 --> 00:27:15,903
Do you have many friends
here in the city?

395
00:27:17,654 --> 00:27:20,199
Yeah, some- At work,
and Spencer, of course.

396
00:27:21,116 --> 00:27:23,702
What?
Your husband and your friend?

397
00:27:24,786 --> 00:27:27,372
Well, you better not
let that get around.

398
00:27:27,414 --> 00:27:31,043
You know, they're going
to haul you up on charges.

399
00:27:31,084 --> 00:27:32,419
That, I like.

400
00:27:32,461 --> 00:27:33,587
What?

401
00:27:33,629 --> 00:27:34,755
Your laugh.

402
00:27:34,796 --> 00:27:37,257
That's an honest laugh.

403
00:27:37,299 --> 00:27:40,219
It's been a while
since I've heard one.

404
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:41,512
Thank you.

405
00:27:42,763 --> 00:27:44,473
It's all right.
I'll be right there.

406
00:27:44,515 --> 00:27:47,142
Apparently, there's some
minor disaster in the kitchen...

407
00:27:47,184 --> 00:27:49,061
something to do
with burning rum balls.

408
00:27:49,102 --> 00:27:50,729
I'm going to call you...

409
00:27:50,771 --> 00:27:53,023
and we're going to go out
and laugh, all right?

410
00:27:54,107 --> 00:27:55,359
All right.

411
00:28:27,182 --> 00:28:28,308
You all right?

412
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:29,977
I'm drunk.

413
00:28:32,312 --> 00:28:34,106
Well, that's good, honey.

414
00:28:38,735 --> 00:28:39,903
That's good.

415
00:28:45,033 --> 00:28:47,327
Tell me what happened up there.

416
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:51,498
Tell me.

417
00:29:04,553 --> 00:29:06,221
All right.

418
00:29:07,264 --> 00:29:08,974
Let's take a walk.

419
00:29:28,535 --> 00:29:30,495
You want to know what happened?

420
00:29:34,958 --> 00:29:36,460
Let me tell you.

421
00:29:42,508 --> 00:29:45,886
Do you want to know
about them two minutes?

422
00:29:45,928 --> 00:29:47,930
You never talk about it.

423
00:29:55,437 --> 00:29:56,605
Two minutes...

424
00:29:58,357 --> 00:29:59,525
dark...

425
00:30:00,859 --> 00:30:02,027
black...

426
00:30:03,862 --> 00:30:05,030
no light.

427
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:09,910
There was an explosion...

428
00:30:09,952 --> 00:30:11,245
and, um...

429
00:30:12,621 --> 00:30:14,164
everything shut down.

430
00:30:15,415 --> 00:30:16,583
No light...

431
00:30:17,834 --> 00:30:19,086
no communication.

432
00:30:20,462 --> 00:30:22,422
It was black...

433
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:23,590
silent.

434
00:30:26,051 --> 00:30:28,053
No sound, but...

435
00:30:28,136 --> 00:30:30,389
but loud-something loud.

436
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:31,598
Loud nothing.

437
00:30:32,766 --> 00:30:36,436
And it was cold.
It was so cold, Jill.

438
00:30:36,478 --> 00:30:39,481
And I knew what that cold was.

439
00:30:40,941 --> 00:30:42,401
It was death...

440
00:30:44,027 --> 00:30:47,072
and it held me real tight
for about the first minute.

441
00:30:47,155 --> 00:30:48,282
And then...

442
00:30:51,285 --> 00:30:52,744
I felt warmth.

443
00:30:53,871 --> 00:30:56,957
It was the warmth
of your vagina...

444
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,959
the warmth of your body...

445
00:30:59,042 --> 00:31:00,127
your hands...

446
00:31:02,296 --> 00:31:04,882
The inside of your mouth...

447
00:31:04,923 --> 00:31:07,342
the warmth of your come...

448
00:31:07,384 --> 00:31:10,679
the warmth from inside you,
Jillian...

449
00:31:10,721 --> 00:31:12,514
your warmth.

450
00:31:15,017 --> 00:31:17,477
I felt it all around me.

451
00:31:18,687 --> 00:31:20,147
It made me breathe.

452
00:31:28,155 --> 00:31:29,698
It made me breathe.

453
00:32:38,642 --> 00:32:39,768
What's happening?

454
00:34:01,016 --> 00:34:02,601
What are you doing?

455
00:34:05,187 --> 00:34:08,982
I couldn't sleep,
so I was just...

456
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:11,276
listening to some music.

457
00:34:33,173 --> 00:34:36,176
I'm sorry if I was a bit rough.

458
00:34:36,218 --> 00:34:39,888
I guess maybe I had
a little too much to drink.

459
00:34:46,603 --> 00:34:49,106
Come on, let's go to bed.

460
00:35:05,706 --> 00:35:07,916
Good night, sweetheart.

461
00:35:47,039 --> 00:35:49,374
"Then she began to guess
the little man's name.

462
00:35:49,416 --> 00:35:52,461
"'Is it Conrad Peppermill?'
she said...

463
00:35:52,502 --> 00:35:54,463
"And the little man said... "

464
00:35:57,549 --> 00:36:01,011
"'I know, I know.
It's Sir William Doorknob...'

465
00:36:01,094 --> 00:36:03,013
"and the little man said... "

466
00:36:05,974 --> 00:36:07,434
"'I have it.

467
00:36:07,518 --> 00:36:10,187
"It must be
Little Ribs of Beef...'

468
00:36:10,229 --> 00:36:12,064
"and the little man said... "

469
00:36:15,692 --> 00:36:18,153
"'It couldn't be
Rumpelstiltskin, could it?'"

470
00:36:19,446 --> 00:36:21,949
"'What did you say?'
said the little man.

471
00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:24,201
"'I said it couldn't be...'"

472
00:36:24,236 --> 00:36:27,704
Rumpelstiltskin!

473
00:36:27,746 --> 00:36:29,289
"And the little man
screamed... "

474
00:36:30,999 --> 00:36:32,793
"and stamped his foot. "

475
00:36:44,555 --> 00:36:46,932
Honey, you sound so sad.

476
00:36:46,974 --> 00:36:48,517
It's just the city, Nan.

477
00:36:50,227 --> 00:36:52,855
It just gets inside you,
that's all.

478
00:36:52,896 --> 00:36:54,523
You can't let it.

479
00:36:54,565 --> 00:36:57,067
That's how you got in trouble
after Mom and Dad died...

480
00:36:57,109 --> 00:37:00,529
and you sound like you did then.

481
00:37:00,571 --> 00:37:04,283
Have you found a doctor
to talk to yet?

482
00:37:04,324 --> 00:37:06,118
Uh-uh.
Not yet.

483
00:37:07,494 --> 00:37:09,037
Promise me something, OK?

484
00:37:09,121 --> 00:37:12,040
If it gets like it was before...

485
00:37:12,082 --> 00:37:14,418
that you'll find
someone to talk to.

486
00:37:16,253 --> 00:37:18,589
Nan, I really have to go, OK?

487
00:37:22,843 --> 00:37:24,011
You're late.

488
00:37:25,429 --> 00:37:27,097
You didn't get my message?

489
00:37:27,139 --> 00:37:29,099
I had a dinner meeting tonight.

490
00:37:29,141 --> 00:37:31,018
No.
I didn't check the machine yet.

491
00:37:31,059 --> 00:37:33,353
Oh, well, I'm sorry.

492
00:37:33,395 --> 00:37:36,982
I still ain't conquered
this corporate shit yet.

493
00:37:37,024 --> 00:37:39,109
I'm going to take
a shower, honey.

494
00:38:42,631 --> 00:38:44,132
Do you ever think...

495
00:38:44,216 --> 00:38:46,468
what if I had a F-Fifteen
in World War II...

496
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:48,262
or a B-Seventeen in World War I?

497
00:38:48,303 --> 00:38:49,429
No, never.

498
00:38:49,471 --> 00:38:51,098
What kind of ass I could kick...

499
00:38:51,139 --> 00:38:52,641
if I had that type
of advanced technology?

500
00:38:52,683 --> 00:38:55,143
And how many different kinds
of ass are there?

501
00:38:55,185 --> 00:38:57,563
Many kinds, love...

502
00:38:57,604 --> 00:38:59,439
but the modern battlefield
is all electronic...

503
00:38:59,481 --> 00:39:02,317
and the fighter that this man
has helped us design...

504
00:39:02,359 --> 00:39:06,029
can detect, sort, identify,
and eliminate...

505
00:39:06,071 --> 00:39:07,322
anything electronic.

506
00:39:07,364 --> 00:39:09,116
You got two McLaren engines...

507
00:39:09,157 --> 00:39:12,035
pumping twenty-five thousand
pounds of thrust...

508
00:39:12,077 --> 00:39:14,204
wingspan of seventy-five feet.

509
00:39:14,246 --> 00:39:15,539
Fully extended.

510
00:39:15,581 --> 00:39:17,791
Oh, yeah, that's fully extended.

511
00:39:17,833 --> 00:39:20,210
You got a top speed of eighteen
hundred miles per hour...

512
00:39:20,252 --> 00:39:22,713
a ceiling
of fifty-five thousand feet...

513
00:39:22,754 --> 00:39:25,215
and a crew of two.

514
00:39:25,257 --> 00:39:27,968
The modern battlefield
is a blizzard...

515
00:39:28,010 --> 00:39:30,721
a transparent,
electronic blizzard...

516
00:39:30,762 --> 00:39:32,639
with planes and tanks...

517
00:39:32,681 --> 00:39:35,893
and computers and missiles
all humming away...

518
00:39:35,934 --> 00:39:39,271
and into that storm
flies our fighter.

519
00:39:39,313 --> 00:39:40,564
It doesn't drop bombs.

520
00:39:40,606 --> 00:39:42,149
It doesn't shoot missiles.

521
00:39:42,191 --> 00:39:43,650
It just sends out a signal.

522
00:39:45,068 --> 00:39:46,653
It's like the voice of God.

523
00:39:46,695 --> 00:39:49,740
It's just a signal
that turns everything off.

524
00:39:49,781 --> 00:39:53,160
I forget, Jackson-
who is the enemy now...

525
00:39:53,202 --> 00:39:55,537
that we need your plane
to defend us from?

526
00:39:55,579 --> 00:39:56,997
The enemy at this moment?

527
00:39:57,039 --> 00:39:59,458
You are, dear.
You are.

528
00:40:01,168 --> 00:40:04,922
The signal it makes-
what does it sound like?

529
00:40:04,963 --> 00:40:07,174
Oh, humans can't hear it, dove.

530
00:40:07,216 --> 00:40:10,010
Humans can't hear it at all.

531
00:40:10,052 --> 00:40:11,303
Excuse me, a moment.

532
00:40:11,345 --> 00:40:12,513
Miss Augusta
would like to see you.

533
00:40:12,554 --> 00:40:14,097
Oh, all right.
Come on, Jackson.

534
00:40:14,139 --> 00:40:16,266
Augusta has summoned us
to her bedside.

535
00:40:16,308 --> 00:40:18,018
It's the good-night kiss.

536
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:19,686
After allowance...

537
00:40:19,728 --> 00:40:22,940
it's the most important event
of the day.

538
00:40:22,981 --> 00:40:24,525
The joys of parenthood.

539
00:40:24,566 --> 00:40:25,692
Come on, Jackson.

540
00:40:25,734 --> 00:40:26,902
Coming.

541
00:40:49,383 --> 00:40:51,927
Why are you so far away?

542
00:40:51,969 --> 00:40:53,929
I'm right here.

543
00:40:53,971 --> 00:40:56,139
What's the matter?

544
00:40:56,181 --> 00:40:57,683
What's wrong?

545
00:40:57,724 --> 00:41:00,519
I don't understand any of this.

546
00:41:00,561 --> 00:41:02,104
What they're talking about...

547
00:41:02,187 --> 00:41:03,856
it's like they're
speaking in code.

548
00:41:03,897 --> 00:41:06,275
Honey,
it's business,that's all.

549
00:41:07,234 --> 00:41:09,785
Why do you have
to build that plane?

550
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:13,615
The way you talk about it,
it doesn't even sound like you.

551
00:41:13,657 --> 00:41:15,951
Baby, it's my job.

552
00:41:15,993 --> 00:41:17,202
My job.

553
00:41:18,745 --> 00:41:22,374
You used to say
you'd fly forever.

554
00:41:22,416 --> 00:41:27,379
You used to say they'd have
to bury you in the sky.

555
00:41:27,421 --> 00:41:29,089
Yeah.
They almost did.

556
00:41:36,847 --> 00:41:40,058
What are you looking for
when you look at me like that?

557
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:42,603
What are you hiding from me?

558
00:41:47,399 --> 00:41:48,525
Nothing.

559
00:42:11,006 --> 00:42:14,468
This is going to be
a little cold.

560
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:21,683
Let's have a look in here,
shall we?

561
00:42:23,769 --> 00:42:25,229
Ah, there it is.

562
00:42:26,605 --> 00:42:27,773
Let's take a measurement.

563
00:42:31,985 --> 00:42:35,781
Nine weeks,
give or take a few days.

564
00:42:35,822 --> 00:42:37,658
See this here?

565
00:42:37,699 --> 00:42:39,201
This flickering?

566
00:42:39,243 --> 00:42:40,369
What is that?

567
00:42:40,410 --> 00:42:41,912
That's the heartbeat.

568
00:42:46,291 --> 00:42:48,293
Is it supposed to be
moving that fast?

569
00:42:49,503 --> 00:42:52,923
I would be worried
if it were not.

570
00:42:52,965 --> 00:42:54,925
Everything looks fine, Jillian.

571
00:42:59,012 --> 00:43:00,180
Well, that's interesting.

572
00:43:01,974 --> 00:43:03,141
What?

573
00:43:04,518 --> 00:43:05,727
Well, wait.
I'm not sure.

574
00:43:11,275 --> 00:43:13,277
See this here?

575
00:43:13,318 --> 00:43:14,903
What is that?

576
00:43:14,945 --> 00:43:17,072
A second heartbeat.

577
00:43:17,114 --> 00:43:18,615
Two heartbeats.

578
00:43:20,659 --> 00:43:22,995
It's twins, Mrs. Armacost...

579
00:43:23,036 --> 00:43:24,162
twins.

580
00:43:29,209 --> 00:43:32,963
This is a number
of a support group...

581
00:43:33,005 --> 00:43:35,507
for women who are
expecting twins.

582
00:43:38,927 --> 00:43:41,388
There's something
I didn't tell you...

583
00:43:41,430 --> 00:43:42,598
for my chart.

584
00:43:44,308 --> 00:43:46,226
I know I should've, but...

585
00:43:47,644 --> 00:43:50,647
Afew years ago,
after my parents died...

586
00:43:51,648 --> 00:43:52,816
I...

587
00:43:56,695 --> 00:43:58,447
I had a bad time.

588
00:43:59,865 --> 00:44:01,033
How bad, Jillian?

589
00:44:04,745 --> 00:44:07,247
I would see people I knew...

590
00:44:09,541 --> 00:44:10,834
I would see them dead.

591
00:44:12,419 --> 00:44:14,546
And sometimes, I...

592
00:44:16,340 --> 00:44:18,133
I would see myself.

593
00:44:22,179 --> 00:44:23,514
Did you seek treatment?

594
00:44:25,807 --> 00:44:27,351
Were you hospitalized?

595
00:44:36,985 --> 00:44:38,153
Does he know?

596
00:44:40,489 --> 00:44:42,699
He's the one
that got me through it.

597
00:44:42,741 --> 00:44:46,119
You are afraid...

598
00:44:46,161 --> 00:44:47,412
that this pregnancy...

599
00:44:47,454 --> 00:44:49,748
is going to bring
all that back, right?

600
00:44:52,751 --> 00:44:54,795
Spend time with Spencer.

601
00:44:54,837 --> 00:44:56,380
Go through this together.

602
00:44:56,421 --> 00:44:57,840
Now that you know...

603
00:44:57,881 --> 00:44:59,842
that all these feelings
you've been having...

604
00:44:59,883 --> 00:45:02,052
are caused by the life
growing in you...

605
00:45:02,094 --> 00:45:06,932
and by your body adapting to it,
oh, cherish it.

606
00:45:07,975 --> 00:45:12,271
And if you need,
call me any time, day or night.

607
00:45:12,312 --> 00:45:13,897
Thank you.

608
00:45:43,886 --> 00:45:45,762
Just a nightmare, baby.

609
00:45:47,264 --> 00:45:49,766
You were talking in your sleep.

610
00:45:51,602 --> 00:45:52,811
What was I saying?

611
00:45:52,853 --> 00:45:55,105
Couldn't tell.

612
00:45:55,147 --> 00:45:57,983
It didn't sound like words,
really.

613
00:45:58,025 --> 00:45:59,318
It was more like sounds.

614
00:46:00,861 --> 00:46:02,279
I'm scared.

615
00:46:04,573 --> 00:46:07,159
Well, I think it'd be strange...

616
00:46:08,327 --> 00:46:10,954
if a first-time mother
wasn't scared, honey.

617
00:46:16,710 --> 00:46:18,795
Come on.
Come with me.

618
00:46:22,090 --> 00:46:23,217
There you go.

619
00:46:23,258 --> 00:46:25,636
That's better, ain't it?

620
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:36,146
Everything's going
to be OK, isn't it?

621
00:46:38,899 --> 00:46:41,318
Everything's going
to be just fine, honey.

622
00:46:42,569 --> 00:46:44,530
And they're going
to be healthy, right?

623
00:46:45,739 --> 00:46:48,534
They're going to be beautiful,
just like their mother.

624
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:54,915
What do you think they'll be
when they grow up?

625
00:46:54,957 --> 00:46:56,500
What are they going to be?

626
00:46:57,793 --> 00:47:00,504
Shit,they going to be
pilots, honey.

627
00:47:00,546 --> 00:47:04,341
Just like their father.

628
00:47:05,592 --> 00:47:07,678
All right, lean back here.

629
00:47:07,719 --> 00:47:09,721
Let me wash your hair.

630
00:47:18,313 --> 00:47:20,190
Am I dreaming, Spencer?

631
00:47:27,406 --> 00:47:29,032
No, you're not dreaming.

632
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:34,788
And then he gives you
that look...

633
00:47:34,830 --> 00:47:38,292
that "honey, I understand" look.

634
00:47:38,333 --> 00:47:40,127
I don't care how long
he rubs my feet for.

635
00:47:40,169 --> 00:47:42,713
He doesn't understand a thing.

636
00:47:42,754 --> 00:47:44,840
He rubs your feet?

637
00:47:44,882 --> 00:47:46,967
I know what you mean.

638
00:47:47,009 --> 00:47:49,261
We're supposed to be going
through this together...

639
00:47:49,303 --> 00:47:52,306
but I have never felt
more separate from him.

640
00:47:52,347 --> 00:47:54,224
It's like there's something
going on in my body...

641
00:47:54,266 --> 00:47:56,768
he knows nothing about.

642
00:47:56,810 --> 00:47:58,562
He rubs your feet?

643
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:02,900
I get into the bathtub
with my socks on.

644
00:49:25,524 --> 00:49:27,359
Aah!
Oh, my God!

645
00:49:29,069 --> 00:49:31,280
Jesus, you scared me.

646
00:49:35,868 --> 00:49:38,203
You are in big trouble.

647
00:49:39,663 --> 00:49:40,873
Do you like the pie?

648
00:49:42,082 --> 00:49:44,668
I don't believe I can take
much more of this, honey.

649
00:49:44,710 --> 00:49:46,086
How much do you like the pie?

650
00:49:49,298 --> 00:49:50,507
Come get the pie.

651
00:49:50,549 --> 00:49:53,802
First, I'm going to drink you,
then I'm going to eat you.

652
00:49:53,844 --> 00:49:54,970
Get the pie.

653
00:49:55,012 --> 00:49:57,014
I'm going to eat that, right?

654
00:49:58,432 --> 00:50:00,142
Think you can handle
all three of us?

655
00:50:01,143 --> 00:50:02,269
Do you love the belly?

656
00:50:02,311 --> 00:50:03,437
I love it.

657
00:50:03,478 --> 00:50:05,564
Good,'cause
I love the belly, too.

658
00:50:13,739 --> 00:50:15,157
Excuse me.

659
00:50:26,502 --> 00:50:30,297
Do you remember me?

660
00:50:42,267 --> 00:50:44,603
- How many months?
- Just a few.

661
00:50:45,521 --> 00:50:46,730
I need to speak with you.

662
00:50:47,856 --> 00:50:50,943
Spencer works for McLaren now,
if you're looking for him.

663
00:50:50,984 --> 00:50:55,489
No, I need to speak with you,
Mrs. Armacost...

664
00:50:57,824 --> 00:50:59,952
about those two minutes.

665
00:50:59,993 --> 00:51:03,080
The two minutes, Mrs. Armacost.

666
00:51:03,121 --> 00:51:05,290
What is it, Mr. Reese?

667
00:51:05,332 --> 00:51:08,627
Have you noticed any change
in your husband's behavior...

668
00:51:08,669 --> 00:51:09,920
since the shuttle mission?

669
00:51:09,962 --> 00:51:13,423
I've been through these files,
and there are peculiarities.

670
00:51:13,465 --> 00:51:14,640
Like right here.

671
00:51:14,675 --> 00:51:16,176
This is your husband's
signature...

672
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:17,845
before he went on the shuttle
that last time...

673
00:51:17,928 --> 00:51:19,847
and here's a form
that he signed when he returned.

674
00:51:19,888 --> 00:51:23,892
Now, they are similar,
but not the same.

675
00:51:23,934 --> 00:51:25,894
Not the same signature.

676
00:51:25,936 --> 00:51:29,565
Mr. Reese, are you in New York
on official NASA business?

677
00:51:29,606 --> 00:51:31,692
And here's the results
of the medical tests...

678
00:51:31,733 --> 00:51:33,485
that we ran when he got back.

679
00:51:35,863 --> 00:51:38,073
Are you on official
NASA business?

680
00:51:38,108 --> 00:51:39,408
Everything is fine.

681
00:51:39,449 --> 00:51:41,034
Everything shows up normal...

682
00:51:41,076 --> 00:51:43,203
but everything's just
a little bit different...

683
00:51:43,245 --> 00:51:44,538
blood levels...

684
00:51:44,580 --> 00:51:46,248
temperature, EKG, EEG.

685
00:51:46,290 --> 00:51:49,293
Everything's just a little off
from what it was. Look.

686
00:51:51,211 --> 00:51:53,088
Does NASA know you're here?

687
00:51:55,299 --> 00:51:56,842
They wouldn't listen.

688
00:51:56,884 --> 00:51:59,678
They terminated my employment.

689
00:52:03,807 --> 00:52:05,767
I have to go now.

690
00:52:05,809 --> 00:52:11,023
If you have anything to say,
call my husband at McLaren.

691
00:52:11,064 --> 00:52:13,692
I showed them the facts, and
they terminated my employment.

692
00:52:13,734 --> 00:52:15,110
They referred me
to a psychiatrist.

693
00:52:15,944 --> 00:52:17,112
Don't follow me.

694
00:52:19,531 --> 00:52:21,241
I've seen Captain Streck's
autopsy report.

695
00:52:21,283 --> 00:52:23,368
It was a massive stroke.
His system overloaded.

696
00:52:23,410 --> 00:52:25,120
His body couldn't stand
the strain.

697
00:52:25,162 --> 00:52:28,165
I've seen Natalie Streck's
autopsy report as well.

698
00:52:30,792 --> 00:52:33,003
That was a suicide.
She killed herself.

699
00:52:33,045 --> 00:52:34,171
I was there.
I saw it.

700
00:52:34,213 --> 00:52:36,256
Yeah, she did,
but according to the report...

701
00:52:36,298 --> 00:52:40,260
when she killed herself,
she was three weeks pregnant.

702
00:52:40,302 --> 00:52:41,553
What did you say?

703
00:52:41,595 --> 00:52:42,804
She probably conceived...

704
00:52:42,846 --> 00:52:44,223
right after her husband
left the hospital.

705
00:52:44,264 --> 00:52:45,891
She was pregnant, Mrs. Armacost.

706
00:52:47,309 --> 00:52:49,436
What happened
during those two minutes...

707
00:52:49,478 --> 00:52:51,104
when they were alone?

708
00:52:51,146 --> 00:52:53,273
The suits that your husband
and Captain Streck wore...

709
00:52:53,315 --> 00:52:55,609
had built-in recorders.
Listen to the voices.

710
00:52:55,651 --> 00:52:57,986
Something happened that scared
the shit out of them.

711
00:52:58,028 --> 00:52:59,780
What could do that?

712
00:52:59,821 --> 00:53:03,158
No. It was an accident.
There was an explosion, and...

713
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:05,160
No!
They trained for explosions.

714
00:53:05,202 --> 00:53:06,495
They trained for accidents.

715
00:53:06,537 --> 00:53:07,663
They trained
for hundreds of hours.

716
00:53:07,704 --> 00:53:09,206
If something goes wrong,
they have a plan.

717
00:53:09,248 --> 00:53:10,833
They don't panic.
They don't deviate.

718
00:53:10,874 --> 00:53:12,626
They stick to the plan.
That's what they do.

719
00:53:12,668 --> 00:53:14,127
Something happened out there...

720
00:53:14,169 --> 00:53:16,964
that these two men
had not trained for.

721
00:53:17,005 --> 00:53:19,842
What would do that to two
highly-trained astronauts?

722
00:53:19,883 --> 00:53:21,301
Scare them like that?

723
00:53:21,343 --> 00:53:24,346
Can you swear to me
that he's still your husband?

724
00:53:25,681 --> 00:53:28,517
Let go of me, Mr. Reese.

725
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:30,018
Is this man bothering you?

726
00:53:34,314 --> 00:53:35,482
Yes, he is.

727
00:53:35,524 --> 00:53:39,570
You know, don't you?
You already know.

728
00:53:39,611 --> 00:53:41,947
Room three-oh-four, Nesbit Arms,
Mrs. Armacost.

729
00:53:41,989 --> 00:53:43,574
Please, Mrs. Armacost!

730
00:53:45,450 --> 00:53:48,871
OK. Settle down.
Just settle down.

731
00:53:52,249 --> 00:53:54,877
I'm going to rotate the panel
forty-eight degrees.

732
00:53:54,918 --> 00:53:56,420
You got me, Alex?

733
00:53:56,461 --> 00:53:57,900
Spencer, what is that?

734
00:53:57,935 --> 00:53:59,339
Did you feel that?

735
00:53:59,381 --> 00:54:00,549
Spencer, what is that?

736
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:07,556
Oh, Jesus Christ!
What the hell is that?

737
00:54:43,884 --> 00:54:46,261
I'm looking for the pregnant
woman in twenty-four-F.

738
00:54:49,848 --> 00:54:51,266
Jillian, what's wrong?

739
00:54:53,227 --> 00:54:56,230
He said she must have
gotten pregnant right...

740
00:54:56,271 --> 00:54:58,232
right after Alex got back.

741
00:54:58,273 --> 00:55:00,025
Did he say anything else?

742
00:55:00,067 --> 00:55:02,736
Oh, God, Nan.

743
00:55:02,778 --> 00:55:06,532
The last thing you need
to worry about is that freak.

744
00:55:06,573 --> 00:55:08,408
Just have Spencer call someone.

745
00:55:08,450 --> 00:55:09,701
No, Nan.

746
00:55:11,954 --> 00:55:14,081
Spencer can't know about this.

747
00:55:14,122 --> 00:55:16,250
But, Jillian,
you said he looked crazy.

748
00:55:16,291 --> 00:55:21,964
You have to promise me
you won't tell Spencer.

749
00:55:22,005 --> 00:55:23,382
Please promise me.

750
00:55:23,423 --> 00:55:26,218
You can't keep these things
bottled inside you, Jillian.

751
00:55:28,971 --> 00:55:30,973
You're right.

752
00:55:36,228 --> 00:55:39,189
If he bothers me again...

753
00:55:39,231 --> 00:55:43,277
I'll tell Spencer, OK?
Deal?

754
00:55:48,657 --> 00:55:50,457
Your table's ready.

755
00:55:50,492 --> 00:55:53,328
Oh, great. All right.
Let's go sit down.

756
00:55:56,123 --> 00:55:59,835
Stan? This year's grand marshal
at the parade of losers?

757
00:55:59,877 --> 00:56:01,086
He's gone.

758
00:56:01,128 --> 00:56:03,839
We can't all be as lucky
as Jill here.

759
00:56:03,881 --> 00:56:05,841
Oh, no.
It's me that's lucky.

760
00:56:11,513 --> 00:56:13,849
You all right, honey?
What's the matter?

761
00:56:16,393 --> 00:56:17,686
What's the matter, honey?

762
00:56:17,728 --> 00:56:19,438
You all right?

763
00:56:19,473 --> 00:56:21,148
Just a little hot.

764
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:25,652
Why don't you have some water?

765
00:56:28,989 --> 00:56:31,283
I think I'm gonna go home.

766
00:56:42,085 --> 00:56:45,255
All right.

767
00:57:17,037 --> 00:57:18,413
Feeling better?

768
00:57:26,421 --> 00:57:27,548
Where's Nan?

769
00:57:27,589 --> 00:57:29,341
She went out.

770
00:57:29,383 --> 00:57:32,469
It's after midnight.

771
00:57:32,511 --> 00:57:35,430
She's young, Jill.
She's having fun.

772
00:57:35,472 --> 00:57:40,352
Don't you remember
when we used to have fun?

773
00:57:47,734 --> 00:57:49,486
You don't remember that, huh?

774
00:57:54,950 --> 00:57:57,661
All right.

775
00:57:57,703 --> 00:57:59,163
What's wrong with you?

776
00:57:59,204 --> 00:58:02,291
You ever think about
what happened to Alex?

777
00:58:02,332 --> 00:58:04,459
Oh, shit.

778
00:58:04,501 --> 00:58:06,461
What happened to Natalie?

779
00:58:10,340 --> 00:58:12,301
I do, all the time.

780
00:58:13,510 --> 00:58:15,846
Those two minutes
you could have died.

781
00:58:18,265 --> 00:58:21,268
Why do you want to
go back there?

782
00:58:21,310 --> 00:58:23,896
Why do you want to
go back to that?

783
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:29,193
Can't you just try for once
to be happy? Just once?

784
00:58:45,042 --> 00:58:48,378
I'm gonna go to sleep.

785
00:59:08,607 --> 00:59:10,692
It's Jillian Armacost.

786
00:59:10,734 --> 00:59:13,946
The autopsy
on Natalie Streck...

787
00:59:13,987 --> 00:59:16,114
what did it say
about the baby?

788
00:59:19,409 --> 00:59:21,411
Not on the phone,
Mrs. Armacost.

789
00:59:21,453 --> 00:59:24,414
No, you don't understand.
You have to tell me.

790
00:59:24,456 --> 00:59:27,584
What did Natalie's autopsy
say about the baby?

791
00:59:27,626 --> 00:59:28,961
Babies.

792
00:59:32,881 --> 00:59:34,383
What?

793
00:59:34,424 --> 00:59:38,554
Natalie Streck was pregnant
with twins, Mrs. Armacost.

794
00:59:41,974 --> 00:59:43,350
Oh, my God.

795
00:59:45,936 --> 00:59:47,688
What's happening to me?

796
00:59:47,729 --> 00:59:50,357
You are, too, aren't you?

797
00:59:52,860 --> 00:59:54,736
Pregnant with his twins?

798
00:59:56,613 --> 00:59:58,574
Natalie's babies...

799
01:00:03,120 --> 01:00:05,539
What did the autopsy say
about them?

800
01:00:05,581 --> 01:00:07,499
There's something I...

801
01:00:07,541 --> 01:00:09,835
I need to show you,
Mrs. Armacost.

802
01:00:09,877 --> 01:00:11,545
Something you need to see.

803
01:00:11,587 --> 01:00:15,424
Do you know the story
of the princess...

804
01:00:15,465 --> 01:00:19,219
whose beloved prince
dies in battle?

805
01:00:19,261 --> 01:00:24,474
Mrs. Armacost, I have something
you need to see.

806
01:00:24,516 --> 01:00:26,101
Do you understand me?

807
01:00:31,315 --> 01:00:33,275
The enemy prince...

808
01:00:34,860 --> 01:00:37,029
after overrunning
the castle...

809
01:00:39,406 --> 01:00:43,827
finds the princess
and forces himself upon her.

810
01:00:46,663 --> 01:00:50,626
Months later,
the princess is with child.

811
01:00:50,667 --> 01:00:53,587
But whose?

812
01:00:57,090 --> 01:01:01,470
It's either the child
of her enemy...

813
01:01:01,512 --> 01:01:03,889
the man that killed
her husband...

814
01:01:05,557 --> 01:01:08,268
the man that raped her...

815
01:01:11,313 --> 01:01:14,858
in which case, she'll kill
herself and the child...

816
01:01:18,153 --> 01:01:20,614
or it's the child
of her prince...

817
01:01:23,700 --> 01:01:26,036
the only thing
she has left of him...

818
01:01:27,788 --> 01:01:32,042
a part of him
still alive within her...

819
01:01:33,126 --> 01:01:35,295
kept safe inside her...

820
01:01:38,715 --> 01:01:40,551
in which case...

821
01:01:43,679 --> 01:01:47,516
But how would she know
until it was too late?

822
01:01:50,978 --> 01:01:52,688
How will she know...

823
01:01:52,729 --> 01:01:56,400
until the child is born
and she can see its eyes?

824
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:02,447
Meet me right now.

825
01:02:02,489 --> 01:02:04,116
Somewhere public.

826
01:02:04,157 --> 01:02:06,618
Leave your apartment.
Meet me now.

827
01:02:39,860 --> 01:02:41,904
I thought that was you.

828
01:02:43,822 --> 01:02:46,533
I was standing over there
across the street...

829
01:02:46,575 --> 01:02:50,787
and I said to myself,
"Now, is that Sherman Reese?"

830
01:02:50,829 --> 01:02:52,331
Nice to see you.

831
01:02:52,372 --> 01:02:53,582
Commander Armacost.

832
01:02:53,624 --> 01:02:56,335
Yeah. Are you in town
on official business?

833
01:02:56,376 --> 01:03:00,797
I'm not with NASA anymore.

834
01:03:00,839 --> 01:03:02,132
You know what?

835
01:03:02,174 --> 01:03:04,468
You know what?
I heard that.

836
01:03:04,510 --> 01:03:06,345
I heard that, and I thought...

837
01:03:06,386 --> 01:03:09,556
it was one of them nasty
agency rumors.

838
01:03:09,598 --> 01:03:10,933
Well, listen...

839
01:03:10,974 --> 01:03:14,311
if you need a recommendation,
don't hesitate...

840
01:03:14,353 --> 01:03:15,812
because maybe
I can help you out.

841
01:03:15,854 --> 01:03:18,315
Well, I appreciate that.

842
01:03:19,358 --> 01:03:22,569
It's real weird
running into you...

843
01:03:22,611 --> 01:03:26,490
'cause the thing of it is,
I was just thinking about you.

844
01:03:26,532 --> 01:03:30,369
I was thinking about them tests
you wanted to run on me...

845
01:03:30,410 --> 01:03:32,120
you know, after Alex died.

846
01:03:32,162 --> 01:03:33,872
If you got a couple
of minutes right now...

847
01:03:33,914 --> 01:03:36,166
we can go down, have a cup
of coffee or something.

848
01:03:36,208 --> 01:03:37,793
Actually, I got to...

849
01:03:37,835 --> 01:03:39,711
Oh, no, come on, now, Sherman.

850
01:03:39,753 --> 01:03:41,505
You're a man of leisure.

851
01:03:41,547 --> 01:03:43,465
You ain't got nothing but time,
do you?

852
01:03:44,591 --> 01:03:46,885
Come on.

853
01:03:48,053 --> 01:03:49,888
Yeah, it's nice to see you.

854
01:04:05,237 --> 01:04:09,032
Almost forgot your satchel,
Mr. Reese.

855
01:04:09,074 --> 01:04:10,200
I got it.

856
01:04:41,940 --> 01:04:44,318
You were the only one
who knew, Nan.

857
01:04:44,359 --> 01:04:46,361
I asked you not to tell him.

858
01:04:46,403 --> 01:04:48,363
I didn't, OK?

859
01:04:48,405 --> 01:04:50,866
What were you talking about
last night when I was sleeping?

860
01:04:50,908 --> 01:04:52,910
- We were just talking.
- About what?

861
01:04:52,951 --> 01:04:54,077
Just talking, Jillian.

862
01:04:54,119 --> 01:04:57,039
Look, don't do this.
It's not good for you.

863
01:04:57,080 --> 01:04:58,790
Where did you go last night?

864
01:04:58,832 --> 01:05:00,083
Will you listen to yourself?

865
01:05:00,125 --> 01:05:01,251
Where did you go?

866
01:05:01,293 --> 01:05:02,878
Look, Jillian, I love you, OK?

867
01:05:02,920 --> 01:05:05,547
And Spencer loves you.
We all do so much.

868
01:05:05,589 --> 01:05:08,592
Spencer was there.

869
01:05:08,634 --> 01:05:12,221
Nan, Spencer was there
with Reese...

870
01:05:12,262 --> 01:05:15,224
and you were the only one
who knew, Nan.

871
01:05:15,265 --> 01:05:17,809
How did he know
unless you told him?

872
01:05:17,851 --> 01:05:19,937
You promised me!

873
01:05:21,772 --> 01:05:23,065
Jillian, I love you...

874
01:05:23,106 --> 01:05:25,609
but I'm not going to do this
with you.

875
01:05:30,989 --> 01:05:34,034
Do what with me?

876
01:05:34,076 --> 01:05:35,244
Come back, Nan.

877
01:05:35,285 --> 01:05:37,955
Nan, come back!

878
01:05:39,414 --> 01:05:40,707
Don't leave, Nan!

879
01:05:45,712 --> 01:05:47,714
Shit!

880
01:06:09,862 --> 01:06:11,530
Hello. Nesbit Arms.

881
01:06:11,572 --> 01:06:14,575
Mr. Reese in room three-oh-four.

882
01:06:24,877 --> 01:06:27,004
There's no answer
in room three-oh-four.

883
01:06:30,591 --> 01:06:33,260
Down came the rain

884
01:06:33,343 --> 01:06:36,972
And washed the spider out

885
01:06:37,014 --> 01:06:39,391
Out came the sun

886
01:06:39,433 --> 01:06:42,978
And dried up all the rain

887
01:06:43,020 --> 01:06:46,273
And the itsy-bitsy spider

888
01:06:46,315 --> 01:06:49,067
Climbed up the spout again

889
01:09:03,410 --> 01:09:04,912
Oh, God.

890
01:09:26,308 --> 01:09:27,476
Are you OK?

891
01:09:40,948 --> 01:09:42,616
It's like a joke, right?

892
01:09:42,658 --> 01:09:45,619
But if you are watching
this tape...

893
01:09:45,661 --> 01:09:48,247
I didn't get to that meeting.

894
01:09:48,288 --> 01:09:50,874
If you are watching this tape,
Mrs. Armacost...

895
01:09:50,916 --> 01:09:52,209
I'm probably fucking dead!

896
01:09:52,251 --> 01:09:54,586
This is my backup.

897
01:09:54,628 --> 01:09:57,589
That's what they
taught us at NASA.

898
01:09:57,631 --> 01:10:00,592
Always have a backup system.

899
01:10:00,634 --> 01:10:04,263
I'm not crazy.
I wish I was.

900
01:10:04,304 --> 01:10:08,600
I prayed I was.
I know I'm not.

901
01:10:08,642 --> 01:10:10,853
You might think you're crazy.

902
01:10:12,229 --> 01:10:13,480
How could you not?

903
01:10:18,026 --> 01:10:21,572
Always have a backup.

904
01:10:21,613 --> 01:10:24,449
You're going to hear
two voices on this tape.

905
01:10:24,491 --> 01:10:28,328
One is your husband's
and the other Captain Streck.

906
01:10:28,370 --> 01:10:32,166
I'm gonna rotate the panel
forty-eight degrees...

907
01:10:32,207 --> 01:10:35,043
This line is your
husband's voice.

908
01:10:35,085 --> 01:10:37,004
This line is Captain Streck's.

909
01:10:37,045 --> 01:10:38,505
Spencer, what is that?

910
01:10:38,547 --> 01:10:40,090
What the fuck...

911
01:10:40,132 --> 01:10:42,593
Jesus Christ!
What the hell is that?

912
01:10:42,634 --> 01:10:44,636
Two voices, but three lines.

913
01:10:44,678 --> 01:10:46,722
There's something else
on the tape.

914
01:10:46,763 --> 01:10:50,017
Something beyond our range
of hearing...

915
01:10:50,058 --> 01:10:52,019
but I translated it.

916
01:10:52,060 --> 01:10:54,146
I had to hear it...

917
01:10:54,188 --> 01:10:56,315
and this...

918
01:10:58,358 --> 01:11:00,652
is what it sounds like.

919
01:11:11,205 --> 01:11:13,540
NASA said that it's static...

920
01:11:13,582 --> 01:11:14,791
It's not static.

921
01:11:14,833 --> 01:11:16,543
...caused by the explosion
of the satellite...

922
01:11:16,585 --> 01:11:19,588
static build up in their suits,
but it's not static.

923
01:11:19,630 --> 01:11:21,298
I tracked it.
It is not static.

924
01:11:21,340 --> 01:11:22,508
Not static.

925
01:11:22,549 --> 01:11:25,886
It's not from their suits,
the satellite, or shuttle.

926
01:11:27,763 --> 01:11:30,349
It's not from Earth, either.

927
01:11:32,976 --> 01:11:35,562
Two minutes-that's all
there is. That's all it took.

928
01:11:35,646 --> 01:11:40,275
If you wanted to come here
from very very far away...

929
01:11:40,317 --> 01:11:43,612
maybe you wouldn't
have to travel in a ship.

930
01:11:43,654 --> 01:11:45,739
Maybe you could travel
in a transmission...

931
01:11:45,781 --> 01:11:49,117
at the speed of light,
like a thought.

932
01:11:49,159 --> 01:11:51,537
Just wait...

933
01:11:51,578 --> 01:11:54,248
for two of us to be up there.

934
01:11:55,457 --> 01:11:57,125
Two of us...

935
01:11:57,167 --> 01:11:59,294
in orbit, near a target.

936
01:11:59,336 --> 01:12:01,255
Something to aim at,
like the satellite.

937
01:12:01,296 --> 01:12:04,508
Two of us beyond suspicion.

938
01:12:04,550 --> 01:12:06,635
Heroes, all-Americans.

939
01:12:06,677 --> 01:12:10,055
Wait for them...

940
01:12:10,097 --> 01:12:15,644
then erase them like a tape
and record your own message.

941
01:12:17,312 --> 01:12:20,190
He's not your husband anymore.

942
01:12:20,232 --> 01:12:21,650
He's not.

943
01:12:21,692 --> 01:12:22,943
What?

944
01:12:24,444 --> 01:12:26,071
The computer that runs
this airplane...

945
01:12:26,113 --> 01:12:27,781
it's not there.
It hasn't been designed yet...

946
01:12:27,823 --> 01:12:30,951
but it's supposed to go...
right here in the cockpit...

947
01:12:30,993 --> 01:12:34,163
right where the pilots
are supposed to be.

948
01:12:37,541 --> 01:12:41,628
Two computers that work
off each other...

949
01:12:41,670 --> 01:12:44,631
that feed off each other.

950
01:12:44,673 --> 01:12:46,800
Twins.

951
01:12:46,842 --> 01:12:48,510
Twin computers.

952
01:12:50,179 --> 01:12:52,472
Twins, Mrs. Armacost.

953
01:12:52,514 --> 01:12:55,517
What do you think
you have inside of you?

954
01:12:55,559 --> 01:12:58,854
What do you think he put there?

955
01:12:58,896 --> 01:13:00,606
What are they going to be?

956
01:13:00,647 --> 01:13:02,774
They going to be pilots, honey.

957
01:13:02,816 --> 01:13:05,527
Just like their father.

958
01:13:15,871 --> 01:13:17,915
What's the matter?
Did I scare you?

959
01:13:17,956 --> 01:13:20,042
I didn't hear you come in.

960
01:13:21,793 --> 01:13:24,630
Listen, I came home,'cause...

961
01:13:24,671 --> 01:13:28,425
I felt bad for you.
That fight with Nan, you know.

962
01:13:28,467 --> 01:13:31,386
Why don't tell me
what it was about?

963
01:13:31,428 --> 01:13:33,347
Just sister stuff.

964
01:13:33,388 --> 01:13:35,057
Have you heard from her?

965
01:13:38,268 --> 01:13:40,395
Well...

966
01:13:40,437 --> 01:13:42,397
I'm sure she'll call you.

967
01:13:45,943 --> 01:13:47,402
You're trembling.

968
01:13:50,405 --> 01:13:51,657
I am?

969
01:13:54,618 --> 01:13:56,119
I'm a little cold.

970
01:14:00,207 --> 01:14:01,875
You know what I did?

971
01:14:01,917 --> 01:14:06,964
I brought something home
I believe's gonna cheer you up.

972
01:14:07,005 --> 01:14:08,340
What do you think?

973
01:14:09,341 --> 01:14:10,592
Pop it in.

974
01:14:17,724 --> 01:14:20,644
Were you watching something?

975
01:14:24,481 --> 01:14:28,569
It's a-
it's a pregnancy video.

976
01:14:32,614 --> 01:14:35,242
Well, maybe we should
watch it together.

977
01:14:41,081 --> 01:14:42,875
Let's watch the movie.

978
01:14:42,916 --> 01:14:45,210
You sure?

979
01:14:47,754 --> 01:14:50,591
All right.

980
01:14:52,426 --> 01:14:54,928
Why are you building that plane?

981
01:14:54,970 --> 01:14:56,972
What's that?

982
01:14:57,014 --> 01:14:58,599
Why do you have to
build that plane?

983
01:14:58,640 --> 01:15:01,351
It's a contract, Jill.

984
01:15:01,393 --> 01:15:02,603
And besides...

985
01:15:02,644 --> 01:15:06,190
I didn't add half as much
as Jackson said I did.

986
01:15:06,231 --> 01:15:09,359
They got some real sharp
engineers over there.

987
01:15:09,401 --> 01:15:11,195
Come here.
Mmm, back here.

988
01:15:13,238 --> 01:15:14,406
Come on.

989
01:15:26,376 --> 01:15:28,337
I know what you're thinking.

990
01:15:30,923 --> 01:15:32,508
Don't you worry.

991
01:15:32,549 --> 01:15:36,428
Everything's gonna be just fine.

992
01:16:25,602 --> 01:16:28,272
Yeah, these pesky
goddamn satellites.

993
01:16:28,313 --> 01:16:30,065
I'm gonna rotate the panel
forty-eight degrees.

994
01:16:30,107 --> 01:16:31,532
You got me, Alex?

995
01:16:31,567 --> 01:16:34,695
Spencer, what is that?
Did you feel that?

996
01:16:34,736 --> 01:16:36,363
Spencer, what is that?

997
01:16:36,398 --> 01:16:37,496
What the fuck...

998
01:16:37,531 --> 01:16:40,284
Jesus Christ!
What the hell is that?

999
01:16:57,634 --> 01:16:59,219
Must have dozed off.

1000
01:17:01,305 --> 01:17:03,140
Were you dreaming?

1001
01:17:06,101 --> 01:17:07,644
No. Just sleeping.

1002
01:17:09,730 --> 01:17:11,023
You weren't dreaming?

1003
01:17:15,277 --> 01:17:16,820
I wasn't dreaming.

1004
01:17:21,366 --> 01:17:22,659
Were you?

1005
01:17:26,830 --> 01:17:29,708
My caterer gets them
from the French Caribbean.

1006
01:17:29,750 --> 01:17:33,170
The French are so much more
advanced in this way.

1007
01:17:36,798 --> 01:17:38,258
Now, listen, with these...

1008
01:17:38,300 --> 01:17:41,303
all sales are final.

1009
01:17:41,345 --> 01:17:44,223
Are you sure this is the way
you want to go?

1010
01:17:56,360 --> 01:17:57,986
Now, when you get home...

1011
01:17:58,028 --> 01:18:00,364
you take both pills
and then go to bed.

1012
01:18:00,405 --> 01:18:02,866
It's gonna be quite a bit
of vile cramping...

1013
01:18:02,908 --> 01:18:04,409
but as soon as you
start spotting...

1014
01:18:04,451 --> 01:18:05,994
it goes real fast.

1015
01:18:06,036 --> 01:18:08,330
And Spencer won't know?

1016
01:18:08,372 --> 01:18:09,957
If he's anything
like the rest...

1017
01:18:09,998 --> 01:18:11,542
he'll think
you had a miscarriage...

1018
01:18:11,583 --> 01:18:13,877
and he'll go out
and buy you a bracelet.

1019
01:18:21,343 --> 01:18:24,638
Now, don't beat yourself up
about this, sweetheart.

1020
01:18:24,680 --> 01:18:30,018
I mean, it's not as if
any of this means anything.

1021
01:18:38,527 --> 01:18:41,196
There's a little bit of pain...

1022
01:18:41,238 --> 01:18:44,074
and then it's over.

1023
01:18:46,952 --> 01:18:48,162
Oh, God.

1024
01:18:48,203 --> 01:18:50,247
I can't.

1025
01:18:50,289 --> 01:18:52,374
Oh, God.

1026
01:18:52,416 --> 01:18:55,252
I can't do it.

1027
01:18:55,294 --> 01:18:58,380
It's gonna be really bad.

1028
01:19:02,718 --> 01:19:04,845
I'm so sorry.

1029
01:19:04,887 --> 01:19:08,515
You'll understand.

1030
01:19:08,557 --> 01:19:10,058
I have to.

1031
01:19:12,603 --> 01:19:13,729
Wait.

1032
01:19:14,938 --> 01:19:16,064
Just...

1033
01:19:17,816 --> 01:19:19,610
a little pain.

1034
01:19:19,651 --> 01:19:21,570
Just...

1035
01:19:21,612 --> 01:19:24,114
And then it's over.

1036
01:19:32,080 --> 01:19:34,458
They're just babies.

1037
01:19:34,500 --> 01:19:35,792
I can't do it.

1038
01:19:35,834 --> 01:19:37,294
Oh, God.

1039
01:19:37,336 --> 01:19:38,837
I can't do it.

1040
01:19:40,631 --> 01:19:41,924
Oh, help me!

1041
01:19:44,134 --> 01:19:46,887
No. Don't do that.

1042
01:19:54,895 --> 01:19:56,396
Oh, God, stop it.

1043
01:19:56,438 --> 01:19:58,607
He's gonna...

1044
01:20:03,070 --> 01:20:04,696
They're just-they're...

1045
01:20:11,662 --> 01:20:13,747
Oh, God, no.

1046
01:20:15,249 --> 01:20:17,543
What were you gonna do to'em?

1047
01:20:22,798 --> 01:20:25,634
No, you heard them.
Oh, God.

1048
01:20:25,676 --> 01:20:27,052
What were you gonna do?

1049
01:20:29,638 --> 01:20:31,181
Nothing.

1050
01:20:52,536 --> 01:20:55,414
Jill... please.

1051
01:20:57,207 --> 01:21:01,128
Let's just calm down
and talk about this, OK?

1052
01:21:07,885 --> 01:21:09,553
Come on, now, honey.

1053
01:21:18,395 --> 01:21:20,063
Where you gonna go, Jill?

1054
01:22:27,673 --> 01:22:29,174
Don't talk.

1055
01:22:29,216 --> 01:22:32,094
Don't say a word, honey.

1056
01:22:32,135 --> 01:22:34,680
You're fine.
You're fine now.

1057
01:22:38,433 --> 01:22:40,102
They're still inside you, Jill.

1058
01:22:40,143 --> 01:22:43,146
They're right where
they need to be...

1059
01:22:43,188 --> 01:22:47,526
and we're not ever gonna mention
what you tried to do...

1060
01:22:47,568 --> 01:22:50,028
what you tried to do
with them pills, OK?

1061
01:22:50,070 --> 01:22:52,322
Doesn't exist.

1062
01:22:52,364 --> 01:22:54,324
Never happened, Jillian.

1063
01:22:56,243 --> 01:23:00,706
I don't want to hear
a peep out of you.

1064
01:23:00,747 --> 01:23:04,084
You hear me?

1065
01:23:04,126 --> 01:23:06,336
I love you so much.

1066
01:23:06,378 --> 01:23:08,380
I don't know what I'd do...

1067
01:23:08,422 --> 01:23:12,259
if anything ever happened
to you or the babies.

1068
01:23:12,301 --> 01:23:17,139
Now, you just keep quiet,
and you rest.

1069
01:23:17,181 --> 01:23:18,849
I'm here with you.

1070
01:23:20,893 --> 01:23:24,897
I'm always gonna be here,
Jill, always.

1071
01:23:29,276 --> 01:23:30,486
You sleep.

1072
01:23:32,362 --> 01:23:33,530
Good girl.

1073
01:23:57,763 --> 01:24:00,557
I don't want to fight
with you, Jilly.

1074
01:24:00,599 --> 01:24:03,519
There's something wrong, Nan.

1075
01:24:03,560 --> 01:24:05,229
There's not.

1076
01:24:05,270 --> 01:24:07,189
Doctor says
you can go home any day.

1077
01:24:07,231 --> 01:24:10,317
No. Something's wrong...

1078
01:24:10,359 --> 01:24:11,944
with Spencer...

1079
01:24:11,985 --> 01:24:13,403
and the twins.

1080
01:24:13,445 --> 01:24:15,072
Hey, it's just this place.

1081
01:24:15,113 --> 01:24:19,243
No.
He did something to me, Nan...

1082
01:24:19,284 --> 01:24:21,954
and I didn't tell you.

1083
01:24:23,121 --> 01:24:25,415
Jillian, it's just
being in the hospital...

1084
01:24:25,457 --> 01:24:27,417
that makes you feel this way.

1085
01:24:27,459 --> 01:24:29,920
I know that you hate it here...

1086
01:24:29,962 --> 01:24:32,005
but we're gonna
take you home soon...

1087
01:24:32,047 --> 01:24:34,424
and we're all gonna
take care of you.

1088
01:24:34,466 --> 01:24:35,634
You?

1089
01:24:35,676 --> 01:24:37,261
Yeah, of course me.

1090
01:24:37,302 --> 01:24:38,971
Me, Spencer, all of us.

1091
01:24:40,722 --> 01:24:42,015
Oh, God.

1092
01:24:43,976 --> 01:24:45,602
I'm so scared.

1093
01:24:45,644 --> 01:24:49,022
Something horrible
is happening...

1094
01:24:49,064 --> 01:24:50,399
to me...

1095
01:24:50,440 --> 01:24:51,775
and the babies.

1096
01:24:51,817 --> 01:24:54,486
I don't know what's happening.

1097
01:24:54,528 --> 01:24:57,823
Tell me, Jillian, what is it?

1098
01:25:04,788 --> 01:25:06,206
He...

1099
01:25:08,083 --> 01:25:10,711
He's hiding inside me.

1100
01:25:14,047 --> 01:25:16,550
Hiding...

1101
01:25:17,551 --> 01:25:19,178
inside me.

1102
01:25:34,067 --> 01:25:36,528
I think she's awake,
Mr. Armacost.

1103
01:26:04,097 --> 01:26:05,641
Tell me something, Jill.

1104
01:26:07,893 --> 01:26:09,394
If the doctors...

1105
01:26:09,436 --> 01:26:11,772
had any idea
what you were thinking...

1106
01:26:12,981 --> 01:26:15,692
you know, them awful...

1107
01:26:15,734 --> 01:26:17,152
dark thoughts...

1108
01:26:19,238 --> 01:26:21,198
what do you think they'd do?

1109
01:26:23,867 --> 01:26:25,202
They'd lock me up.

1110
01:26:32,376 --> 01:26:35,045
Lock you up?

1111
01:26:35,087 --> 01:26:37,130
They'd chain you
to the wall, Jillian.

1112
01:26:40,551 --> 01:26:43,929
Yeah, put you back
in that hospital.

1113
01:26:45,806 --> 01:26:47,391
You want that to happen?

1114
01:26:52,813 --> 01:26:56,275
I know you don't want that.

1115
01:26:56,316 --> 01:27:00,154
Well... we ain't gonna
let them, are we?

1116
01:27:06,285 --> 01:27:07,953
'Cause we're gonna be strong.

1117
01:27:09,329 --> 01:27:10,706
We're gonna be strong.

1118
01:27:12,249 --> 01:27:13,584
Together.

1119
01:27:13,625 --> 01:27:16,628
We're gonna be strong
for our family.

1120
01:27:22,676 --> 01:27:24,178
We're connected now.

1121
01:27:26,847 --> 01:27:30,184
you feel me inside there
where it's safe, don't you?

1122
01:27:36,064 --> 01:27:37,649
See?

1123
01:27:41,153 --> 01:27:42,446
I live here.

1124
01:27:44,698 --> 01:27:46,366
We're one.

1125
01:28:15,521 --> 01:28:17,856
Why do you have
Sherman Reese's bag?

1126
01:28:20,567 --> 01:28:24,112
What did you do to my sister?

1127
01:28:26,031 --> 01:28:28,158
Who are you?

1128
01:28:30,577 --> 01:28:33,539
What the hell are you doing?

1129
01:28:33,580 --> 01:28:35,415
Let go of me!

1130
01:28:45,717 --> 01:28:47,594
Jillian! Help!

1131
01:30:07,674 --> 01:30:09,551
Washington Square Park.

1132
01:31:05,149 --> 01:31:06,316
What?

1133
01:31:08,735 --> 01:31:11,029
- Go. Go!
- But it is red, missis.

1134
01:31:11,071 --> 01:31:12,197
I don't care!
Just go!

1135
01:31:12,239 --> 01:31:13,407
But, missis, I cannot.

1136
01:31:13,448 --> 01:31:15,701
Will you go?
You don't understand!

1137
01:31:15,742 --> 01:31:17,119
- Please.
- Ý cannot.

1138
01:32:17,513 --> 01:32:20,599
Captain Alex Streck died
last night at eightfifty-five.

1139
01:32:22,809 --> 01:32:24,686
Cause of death
has been determined...

1140
01:32:24,721 --> 01:32:26,355
to have been a massive stroke...

1141
01:32:28,023 --> 01:32:31,318
what the surgeons are calling
a severe insult to the brain.

1142
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:34,238
He's not your husband anymore.

1143
01:33:42,389 --> 01:33:44,266
Welcome back, Mrs. A.

1144
01:33:55,194 --> 01:33:56,528
Good morning, Mr. A.

1145
01:36:24,593 --> 01:36:26,512
Jesus fucking Christ, Jill.

1146
01:36:50,452 --> 01:36:52,454
Stay away from me.

1147
01:36:52,496 --> 01:36:55,249
Why are you doing this to me?

1148
01:36:55,332 --> 01:36:58,001
I said stay...

1149
01:36:58,036 --> 01:37:00,671
away from me.

1150
01:37:11,014 --> 01:37:13,183
Who are you?

1151
01:37:13,218 --> 01:37:15,352
Who am I?

1152
01:37:16,353 --> 01:37:20,691
I'm the only person in the world
who ever gave a fuck about you.

1153
01:37:22,860 --> 01:37:26,572
I'm the one that gave you
a reason to breathe.

1154
01:37:27,739 --> 01:37:31,410
I'm every single fucking moment
ever mattered in your life.

1155
01:37:33,370 --> 01:37:34,663
No, you're not.

1156
01:37:36,707 --> 01:37:38,292
I don't even know you.

1157
01:37:38,333 --> 01:37:41,503
No? Well...

1158
01:37:41,545 --> 01:37:43,213
I'll tell you what.

1159
01:37:43,255 --> 01:37:46,383
There was a time I remember
when I was about to go up...

1160
01:37:46,425 --> 01:37:49,178
and you begged me not to.

1161
01:37:49,219 --> 01:37:52,347
You remember
how scared you were?

1162
01:37:52,389 --> 01:37:54,016
And I told you then...

1163
01:37:54,057 --> 01:37:57,311
that I was gonna bring you back
a little piece of heaven.

1164
01:37:58,562 --> 01:38:00,564
Then you cried.

1165
01:38:00,606 --> 01:38:02,191
You remember that?

1166
01:38:03,817 --> 01:38:05,319
Well, fucking a!

1167
01:38:05,360 --> 01:38:06,862
I did!

1168
01:38:06,904 --> 01:38:08,947
What do you think's inside you?

1169
01:38:13,744 --> 01:38:16,205
I gave you heaven.

1170
01:38:16,246 --> 01:38:18,749
No, you didn't.

1171
01:38:21,084 --> 01:38:23,128
You're not Spencer.

1172
01:38:26,798 --> 01:38:29,134
It don't got to be like this,
honey.

1173
01:38:29,176 --> 01:38:30,511
Please, come on, now.

1174
01:38:30,552 --> 01:38:32,346
Step out of that water.

1175
01:38:32,387 --> 01:38:34,681
Please, baby,
get out of that water.

1176
01:38:36,433 --> 01:38:37,768
Come on.

1177
01:38:37,809 --> 01:38:39,478
Oh, my God.

1178
01:38:41,480 --> 01:38:42,689
Please.

1179
01:38:44,900 --> 01:38:47,069
Oh, my God.

1180
01:38:50,155 --> 01:38:52,449
You killed my sister.

1181
01:38:55,244 --> 01:38:58,413
You killed my husband.

1182
01:39:05,587 --> 01:39:07,589
I did.

1183
01:39:11,134 --> 01:39:13,345
And then I fucked his wife.

1184
01:39:17,015 --> 01:39:18,600
I live there.

1185
01:39:46,712 --> 01:39:49,298
I live there...

1186
01:39:49,339 --> 01:39:50,674
forever.

1187
01:39:50,716 --> 01:39:52,593
No, you don't.

1188
01:40:09,318 --> 01:40:10,694
I live there.

1189
01:40:10,736 --> 01:40:12,696
No, you don't!

1190
01:41:15,425 --> 01:41:17,761
Ready for your first day
of school?

1191
01:41:17,803 --> 01:41:18,971
Ready.

1192
01:41:19,012 --> 01:41:20,889
Wait.

1193
01:41:20,931 --> 01:41:24,893
There's an apple in there,
and I want you guys to eat it.

1194
01:41:24,935 --> 01:41:26,061
No trading.
Promise?

1195
01:41:26,103 --> 01:41:27,402
Promise.

1196
01:41:27,437 --> 01:41:29,606
OK. Give me a kiss.

1197
01:41:31,942 --> 01:41:33,277
Go, go, go, go, go.

1198
01:41:33,318 --> 01:41:34,486
Be good.

1199
01:41:38,448 --> 01:41:40,909
What do you think they'll be
when they grow up?

1200
01:41:40,951 --> 01:41:42,536
Grow up?

1201
01:41:42,578 --> 01:41:45,581
Give them some time, Susan.
It's their first day of school.

1202
01:41:45,622 --> 01:41:47,374
I think...

1203
01:41:50,127 --> 01:41:52,254
they're gonna be pilots.

1204
01:41:52,296 --> 01:41:55,299
Just like their father.

1205
01:41:55,340 --> 01:41:56,842
Step father.

1206
01:42:01,805 --> 01:42:04,725
You're their father now.
