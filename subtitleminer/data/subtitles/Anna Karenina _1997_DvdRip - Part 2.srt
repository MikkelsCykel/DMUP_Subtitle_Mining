Alexei Alexandrovitch,
leave me Seriozha.

2
00:00:08,419 --> 00:00:11,005
You know l can´t live
without him.

3
00:00:18,929 --> 00:00:21,932
lf you´ll conduct yourself
so that neither society

4
00:00:22,099 --> 00:00:24,977
nor the servants can find
anything to say against you,

5
00:00:25,102 --> 00:00:28,064
you can enjoy all the privileges
of a respectable wife

6
00:00:28,272 --> 00:00:31,025
without fulfilling
the duties of one.

7
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:35,112
and you may
keep your son.

8
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:33,915
Late as usuaI.O

9
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:38,086
-You have a Iot of peopIe here.
-Who´s here?

10
00:01:38,753 --> 00:01:40,171
Is Kitty here?e

11
00:01:43,549 --> 00:01:47,220
I never did quite beIieve that there
was anything wrong with my Iungs,

12
00:01:47,303 --> 00:01:51,641
but the secIusion and quiet
of karIsbad were aII heIpfuI to me.

13
00:01:52,558 --> 00:01:55,353
I Iearned how to heIp care
for the other patients,a

14
00:01:55,478 --> 00:01:58,356
those with serious aiIments,a

15
00:01:58,481 --> 00:02:00,775
and the work suited me.v

16
00:02:01,818 --> 00:02:03,319
I Iearned that there are
so many more important...

17
00:02:03,569 --> 00:02:05,321
I saw you Iast summer.m

18
00:02:07,323 --> 00:02:09,575
Oh, you didn´t see me,
but I saw you.a

19
00:02:09,784 --> 00:02:11,452
Where?ã

20
00:02:11,661 --> 00:02:14,831
You were driving to Yergushovo.
My estate´s on the way.

21
00:02:15,665 --> 00:02:18,334
It was very earIy in the morning.
You were probabIy onIy just awake.

22
00:02:19,377 --> 00:02:21,796
You had a spIendid team
of horses with beIIs.

23
00:02:24,841 --> 00:02:26,509
YoufIashed by
in a second.i

24
00:02:26,843 --> 00:02:28,678
I saw you through the window.
Your head was Iike this.

25
00:02:31,472 --> 00:02:33,266
And you were pIaying

26
00:02:33,391 --> 00:02:36,519
with the ribbons of your cap,a

27
00:02:37,395 --> 00:02:41,816
thinking about
something very deepIy.

28
00:02:43,401 --> 00:02:46,321
I wish I knew what
you were thinking then.

29
00:02:47,405 --> 00:02:48,823
ReaIIy?s

30
00:02:49,532 --> 00:02:51,826
I don´t remember.e

31
00:03:03,504 --> 00:03:04,339
Don't go.

32
00:03:09,761 --> 00:03:12,347
I´ve a question I´ve been wanting
to ask youfor a Iong time.

33
00:03:13,514 --> 00:03:14,557
What is it?

34
00:03:17,518 --> 00:03:19,228
Here.é

35
00:03:30,531 --> 00:03:32,867
That´s the first Ietters
of the words.

36
00:03:34,452 --> 00:03:36,245
What is that word?a

37
00:03:36,579 --> 00:03:38,539
-Never.
-Is it something I once said?a

38
00:03:43,419 --> 00:03:45,380
I know what it is.

39
00:03:45,797 --> 00:03:50,343
´´When you toId me it couId not be...

40
00:03:51,302 --> 00:03:54,764
...did that mean never...e

41
00:03:55,765 --> 00:03:57,642
...or then?´´i

42
00:04:19,497 --> 00:04:21,499
I don´t know.a

43
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:26,504
´´Then I couId not answer
differentIy.´´

44
00:04:28,339 --> 00:04:30,592
OnIy then?a

45
00:05:17,847 --> 00:05:20,516
He wiII have reached the church
any moment now.

46
00:05:20,683 --> 00:05:22,810
Word wiII come.g

47
00:05:36,699 --> 00:05:38,785
Oh! This is impossibIe!a

48
00:05:39,369 --> 00:05:41,496
Don´t worry. You´II just
have to wear mine.

49
00:05:41,788 --> 00:05:45,458
Yes, weII, if I was going to do that,
I shouId´ve done it a Iong time ago!

50
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:47,293
Everything wiII
turn out just fine.

51
00:05:49,796 --> 00:05:51,798
Don´t you worry.t

52
00:05:56,302 --> 00:06:00,807
I went out to buy a new shirt.
AII the shops were shut...

53
00:06:19,325 --> 00:06:21,828
I was beginning to think that you had
made up your mind to run away.

54
00:06:22,328 --> 00:06:24,372
What happened to me was
so siIIy, I was...

55
00:06:24,414 --> 00:06:26,749
I´m ashamed
to teII you.l

56
00:06:54,444 --> 00:06:57,405
Kitty shouId have
stepped on the mat first.

57
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:59,324
Whoever does
runs the househoId.i

58
00:06:59,741 --> 00:07:01,200
I did.i

59
00:07:01,451 --> 00:07:03,202
What about you, DoIIy?

60
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:04,621
I don´t remember.x

61
00:07:04,787 --> 00:07:06,623
Why on earth not?P

62
00:07:08,791 --> 00:07:10,418
I was so in Iove.a

63
00:07:44,452 --> 00:07:47,830
Sir, Madame Karenin
miscarried Iast night.

64
00:07:48,331 --> 00:07:50,375
My God, how is she?l

65
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:53,670
Very bad. The doctor
is with her now.

66
00:08:05,348 --> 00:08:07,267
Who is here?m

67
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:08,268
Is... is she...d

68
00:08:08,351 --> 00:08:11,479
She has
a very high fever.q

69
00:08:14,857 --> 00:08:16,859
Ana Arkadyevna,

70
00:08:19,696 --> 00:08:22,490
Has Seriozha had his dinner?
l Know they will allforget.

71
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,285
I am entireIy
in your hands.i

72
00:08:25,535 --> 00:08:28,496
He must be moved
into the corner room...e

73
00:08:29,372 --> 00:08:32,875
Maria told
to sleep with him.

74
00:08:40,341 --> 00:08:42,552
I´m not afraid of you.e

75
00:08:47,557 --> 00:08:50,435
I know I´m dying now.
You ask him.e

76
00:08:53,771 --> 00:08:55,857
I feeI it aIready.v

77
00:08:58,359 --> 00:09:01,529
I want onIy one thing...P

78
00:09:01,571 --> 00:09:03,573
for you to forgive me.m

79
00:09:05,366 --> 00:09:08,453
Forgive me compIeteIy..

80
00:09:51,579 --> 00:09:53,665
There is some hope..

81
00:09:54,457 --> 00:09:56,501
I must stay.e

82
00:09:57,335 --> 00:09:59,504
She may ask for me..

83
00:10:05,677 --> 00:10:09,472
I´ve Iong wanted to be
revenged on you and her.d

84
00:10:11,474 --> 00:10:15,812
When I got the teIegram.
I came here with the same sentiments.

85
00:10:17,689 --> 00:10:19,357
But I saw her...

86
00:10:19,857 --> 00:10:21,609
and forgave her.a

87
00:10:23,361 --> 00:10:25,863
And the happiness of
forgiving her reveaIed to me

88
00:10:26,489 --> 00:10:27,365
my duty.o

89
00:10:28,825 --> 00:10:30,451
I wiII not
forsake her,a

90
00:10:31,494 --> 00:10:35,540
and I wiII never utter a word
of reproach to you.

91
00:10:39,419 --> 00:10:42,380
ShouId she want to see you,
I wiII Iet you know.

92
00:10:42,422 --> 00:10:45,466
Now I think
you´d better Ieave.d

93
00:11:33,598 --> 00:11:35,683
Idiot!

94
00:11:35,975 --> 00:11:40,396
You had the misfortune to faII in Iove
with man who´s not your husband.

95
00:11:40,647 --> 00:11:44,359
This is a misfortune,
but this is a fact.

96
00:11:44,651 --> 00:11:46,653
Your husband
has forgiven you.

97
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,489
AIso a fact.f

98
00:11:49,656 --> 00:11:50,657
The question is,o

99
00:11:51,324 --> 00:11:53,660
can you go on Iiving
with your husband?

100
00:11:53,826 --> 00:11:56,746
Do you want to?
And what does he want?

101
00:11:57,330 --> 00:11:59,249
I don´t know.

102
00:11:59,332 --> 00:12:01,417
I don´t know at aII.e

103
00:12:02,502 --> 00:12:05,755
I feeI I´m fIying headIong
over a precipice.

104
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:08,758
We´II catch you,o

105
00:12:08,758 --> 00:12:11,386
and we won´t
Iet youfaII.a

106
00:12:14,347 --> 00:12:16,516
There is
nothing Ieft for me,

107
00:12:17,433 --> 00:12:19,519
except for it
to be aII over.

108
00:13:14,574 --> 00:13:16,492
Look at you.a

109
00:13:16,659 --> 00:13:20,371
I hardIy know you
with this short hair.

110
00:13:20,747 --> 00:13:22,707
You´ve grown so pretty,
but how paIe you are.

111
00:13:22,749 --> 00:13:24,834
I´m stiII very weak.o

112
00:13:25,668 --> 00:13:27,253
We´II go to ItaIy.p

113
00:13:27,337 --> 00:13:29,380
You´II soon get weII.c

114
00:13:29,505 --> 00:13:31,257
We´II Iive together
as husband and wife.

115
00:13:31,341 --> 00:13:32,592
You´II be ruined.

116
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:35,428

to your grief.

120
00:14:19,847 --> 00:14:22,433
You wiIIfind support,

00:14:23,685 --> 00:14:25,395
but seek it not in me,c

122
00:14:25,436 --> 00:14:27,355
though I beg youa

123
00:14:27,689 --> 00:14:29,232
to beIieve in
our friendship.m

124
00:14:29,357 --> 00:14:31,526
I wiII set to work..

125
00:14:31,734 --> 00:14:34,445
I wiII be your housekeeper.
Don´t thank me.

126
00:14:35,738 --> 00:14:38,366
I do it not of myself.

127
00:14:39,701 --> 00:14:41,452
How can I heIp
thanking you?

128
00:14:41,703 --> 00:14:43,204
You mustr

129
00:14:43,288 --> 00:14:44,372

130
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:47,333
and ask for His heIp.d

131
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:51,129
In Him aIone
can we find peace.

132
00:14:59,721 --> 00:15:01,723
My dear, dear boy.a

133
00:15:03,558 --> 00:15:05,435
How unhappy you must be.o

134
00:15:06,728 --> 00:15:08,730
I´m quite weII,
countess.

135
00:15:10,565 --> 00:15:12,483
Your poor father is...n

so he´s Ieft it to me.o

00:15:20,491 --> 00:15:23,369

141

is dead.s

143
00:15:52,899 --> 00:15:55,818
Letters have arrived from town,

00:15:57,987 --> 00:16:01,908
You see, your Iady´s settIed me here,

00:16:10,667 --> 00:16:12,794
and this is a Ietter
from home.

149
00:16:12,835 --> 00:16:16,506

00:18:03,863 --> 00:18:07,450
remembering him as he was
when he was young.

159
00:18:11,454 --> 00:18:14,791
you can´t imagine
what a charming boy he was.

160
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:25,635
But I didn´t
understand him then.a

161
00:18:38,648 --> 00:18:40,358
In infinite time...o

162
00:18:41,317 --> 00:18:43,653
in infinite matter...

163
00:18:44,445 --> 00:18:46,489
in infinite space...

164
00:18:47,323 --> 00:18:49,659
an organic ceII
stands out,o

165
00:18:50,451 --> 00:18:53,580
wiII hoId together
awhiIe...

166
00:18:54,455 --> 00:18:55,748
and then bursts.i

167
00:18:57,333 --> 00:18:59,752
And that ceII is me.

168
00:19:01,671 --> 00:19:03,506
I cannot Iive without
knowing.

169
00:19:03,673 --> 00:19:07,594
what I am and why I am here,
and that I cannot know.

170
00:19:08,344 --> 00:19:11,681
So, therefore, I
have no reason to Iive.

171
00:19:13,474 --> 00:19:14,767
What?

172
00:19:15,518 --> 00:19:16,853
I´m pregnant.n

173
00:19:25,987 --> 00:19:27,113
WeII, don´t spare
me now.D

174
00:19:29,365 --> 00:19:31,409
It´s going
to be perfection.

175
00:19:32,368 --> 00:19:35,830
-I´m not going to finish it.
-Why?Why ever not?

176
00:19:35,872 --> 00:19:39,500
Because its defects wiII become
more and more obvious.

177
00:19:40,335 --> 00:19:43,671
I can´t fooI myself
that I am an artist.a

178
00:19:43,838 --> 00:19:45,673
I am going
to give it up.

179
00:19:59,437 --> 00:20:02,357
I confess I hardIy miss
Seriozha at aII.

180
00:20:04,859 --> 00:20:06,861
But you do.u

181
00:20:09,572 --> 00:20:10,531
Yes.p

182
00:20:19,457 --> 00:20:21,459
Let´s go back to Russia.

183
00:20:22,543 --> 00:20:24,462
Karenin wiII
grant us a divorce.

184
00:20:24,587 --> 00:20:26,256
We´II get married,
and we´II be together.

185
00:20:26,381 --> 00:20:30,551
Oh, I was afraid you´d say that.
I´m so unpardonabIe happy here,

186
00:20:31,469 --> 00:20:34,389
away from aII of them,
aII of that.

187
00:20:34,722 --> 00:20:36,391
I thought you were, too.b

188
00:20:37,767 --> 00:20:39,227
Being with youc

189
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:42,355
is the reaIization of
aII my deepest desires,s

190
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,441
but there is nothing
I can do here.

191
00:20:45,483 --> 00:20:47,652
I need a purpose.e

192
00:20:48,736 --> 00:20:52,824
That´s what I Iike so much,
having you aII to myself.

193
00:20:54,742 --> 00:20:57,412
Seriozha
needs his mother.r

194
00:21:04,085 --> 00:21:05,378
Dear Lydia lvanovna,v

195
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:08,423
Forgive me for
reminding you of myself.r

196
00:21:08,464 --> 00:21:11,801
Count VronsKy and l are
returning to St. Petersburg.

197
00:21:12,343 --> 00:21:14,345
l am unhappy at
being parted from my son.

198
00:21:15,597 --> 00:21:17,599
l beg to be allowed
to see him.i

199
00:21:17,849 --> 00:21:21,853
Will you send Seriozha to me, or should
l come to the house at some fixed hour?

200
00:21:22,353 --> 00:21:25,273
You cannot conceive
the yearning l have to see him

201
00:21:25,356 --> 00:21:28,776
and so can not conceive the gratitude
your help will arouse in me.

202
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,528
Anna.a

203
00:21:31,779 --> 00:21:33,615
I don´t think
I can refuse her.

204
00:21:33,781 --> 00:21:37,535
My dear friend,
You never see eviI in anybody..

205
00:21:38,786 --> 00:21:40,371
Her Iove for her son
exacts...

206
00:21:40,413 --> 00:21:42,540
But is it Iove?

207
00:21:43,688 --> 00:21:46,649
My friend,
is it sincere?n

208
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:50,528
Have we the right to toy with the
feeIings of that IittIe angeI?

209
00:21:50,653 --> 00:21:52,322
He thinks she´s dead,r

210
00:21:52,405 --> 00:21:54,198
and he prays for hern

211
00:21:54,324 --> 00:21:56,784
and besieges God
have mercy on her sins,n

212
00:21:57,327 --> 00:21:58,536
and it is...e

213
00:21:59,662 --> 00:22:00,997
better.p

214
00:22:04,834 --> 00:22:05,710
Madame,D

215
00:22:06,544 --> 00:22:09,213
to remind
your son of yous

216
00:22:09,339 --> 00:22:13,551
Might lead to questions on his part
which it would be impossible to answer.

217
00:22:13,843 --> 00:22:15,678
l beg you to interpret
your husband's refusal

218
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:18,556
in the spirit
of Christian love.s

219
00:22:33,363 --> 00:22:37,325
I am here to teII you that I Iook upon my
union with Madame Karenina as marriage.

220
00:22:38,701 --> 00:22:42,330
If you wish to be on good terms with me
then you must be on good terms with her.

221
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:46,334
Our intimate friendsc

222
00:22:46,459 --> 00:22:48,503
can and must Iook at it
in the proper Iight.

223
00:22:49,295 --> 00:22:52,632
I for one am so gIad
you are back.b

224
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:55,468
I can imagine how horribIe our
Petersburg must seem to you

225
00:22:55,635 --> 00:22:57,804
after your
deIightfuI traveIs.

226
00:22:58,304 --> 00:23:02,141
-How about the divorce? Is that aII settIed?
-I´m onIy waiting for Karenin.

227
00:23:03,309 --> 00:23:05,478
PeopIe wiII throw
stones at me, I know,s

228
00:23:05,645 --> 00:23:07,355
but I shaII come
and see Anna.

229
00:23:07,397 --> 00:23:09,357
I wiII ignore
the conventions,

230
00:23:09,399 --> 00:23:11,401
but other starchy peopIe
wiII give you the coId shouIder

231
00:23:11,568 --> 00:23:13,820
untiI you are married,.

232
00:23:14,487 --> 00:23:16,197
and that´s
so simpIe nowadays.

233
00:23:16,322 --> 00:23:19,659
Of course, I cannot invite her to my
home. I have daughters growing up.

234
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:21,744
How can you
say that..

235
00:23:21,744 --> 00:23:23,663
When everyone knows you were
Tushkevich´s mistress?

236
00:23:26,833 --> 00:23:28,668
How dare you
make comparisons?c

237
00:23:30,503 --> 00:23:31,671
AIiosha, darIing,s

238
00:23:32,338 --> 00:23:35,508
You hardIy have
the moraI high ground.

239
00:23:58,615 --> 00:24:00,950
The doctor.
It´s time.ç

240
00:24:06,456 --> 00:24:07,624
Are you aII right?h

241
00:24:24,641 --> 00:24:25,308
Get out of here,
Kostya! Go!a

242
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,364
Lord have mercy on us
and heIp us.

243
00:24:59,467 --> 00:25:00,343
A boy too!E

244
00:25:01,511 --> 00:25:03,304
You may ease your mind.

245
00:25:03,513 --> 00:25:04,681
AII is weII.r

246
00:25:04,722 --> 00:25:07,642
Show him to his Papa!e

247
00:25:14,315 --> 00:25:16,317
That´s how they are
when they come out.

248
00:25:17,318 --> 00:25:19,737
This one is a beauty.o

249
00:26:17,295 --> 00:26:18,755
Seriozha...b

250
00:26:21,758 --> 00:26:23,635
my darIing.

251
00:26:40,443 --> 00:26:42,278
They toId me
you were dead.m

252
00:26:42,362 --> 00:26:44,155
You didn´t beIieve it,
my precious.

253
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,407
I never beIieved it!

254
00:26:50,787 --> 00:26:53,289
Oh no, you´d never
have Iet her in!

255
00:26:53,456 --> 00:26:56,709
Ten year´s service and nothing but
kindness from her,

256
00:26:57,293 --> 00:26:59,504
and you´d have got up
and shown her the door.n

257
00:26:59,796 --> 00:27:03,716
He´II get up presentIy and
you wiII be out on the streets.

258
00:27:06,302 --> 00:27:08,179
Don´t go. He won´t
come just yet.r

259
00:27:08,304 --> 00:27:10,431
Seriozha, my darIing,
you must Iove him.ã

260
00:27:10,723 --> 00:27:12,183
He´s better than I am,
and I have been wicked to him.

261
00:27:12,308 --> 00:27:14,519
When you´re grown up,
you wiII understand.h

262
00:27:17,522 --> 00:27:19,524
Don´t go.
Mama!l

263
00:27:23,403 --> 00:27:26,197
Get out! Our door
is closed to you!

264
00:27:26,322 --> 00:27:29,659
You're not welcome here!
You deserted your son!

265
00:27:42,338 --> 00:27:45,800
The laudanum prescribed for Ana
after the loss of her child

266
00:27:46,342 --> 00:27:49,762
Now became the opiate used to
deaden the pain of Seriozha's loss.

267
00:28:16,581 --> 00:28:18,249
Why shouIdn´t I go?s

268
00:28:18,374 --> 00:28:19,334
You are going.a

269
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:22,879
Oh, of course, there´s
no reason whatever.e

270
00:28:24,464 --> 00:28:26,382
That´s exactIy
what I say.c

271
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,844
Anna, for heaven´s sake,
what has come over you?

272
00:28:31,804 --> 00:28:33,806
I don´t understand
what you mean.

273
00:28:35,725 --> 00:28:37,352
You know you can´t go
into the opera.

274
00:28:39,646 --> 00:28:40,813
Why not?e

275
00:28:42,732 --> 00:28:44,234
I´m not going aIone.o

276
00:28:44,317 --> 00:28:46,486
I´m... I´m going
with princess Varvara.

277
00:28:48,571 --> 00:28:50,490
Princess Varvara...o

278
00:28:51,658 --> 00:28:53,826
Is IittIe more
than a courtesan.

279
00:28:54,744 --> 00:28:56,496
She´s no worse
than the others.

280
00:28:58,331 --> 00:29:00,500
Besides, I am not ashamed
of what I have done.

281
00:29:00,667 --> 00:29:03,002
I´m not ashamed
of my Iove for you.q

282
00:29:08,508 --> 00:29:10,551
And whom
are you accompanying?

283
00:29:15,598 --> 00:29:17,684
You´ve been out
with your mother quite a bit IateIy.

284
00:29:18,851 --> 00:29:20,770
Anna, she is my mother.v

285
00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:24,691
I hear your mother has taken on
princess Sorokina as a companion.

286
00:29:27,610 --> 00:29:29,696
Why don´t you make your mother
happy and marry her?i

287
00:29:29,862 --> 00:29:31,531
Anna, I have not
the sIightest interest

288
00:29:31,781 --> 00:29:32,782
in princess Sorokina.r

289
00:29:36,619 --> 00:29:39,539
How do you think
that makes me feeI?n

290
00:29:40,456 --> 00:29:41,332
What?u

291
00:29:44,419 --> 00:29:46,212
How am I
supposed to feeI?.

292
00:29:46,296 --> 00:29:49,757
You spend your evenings
with a pretty young girI.

293
00:29:51,759 --> 00:29:53,636
What do I know?
OnIy what you teII me.a

294
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:56,222
Oh, you don´t trust me?

295
00:29:56,556 --> 00:29:58,641
Why can´t I go out?s

296
00:30:01,769 --> 00:30:04,314
I Iove you, and nothing
eIse matters to me..

297
00:30:05,565 --> 00:30:08,318
So Iong as you
haven´t changed....

298
00:30:10,653 --> 00:30:12,822
As Iong
as you stiII Iove me.

299
00:30:16,826 --> 00:30:18,786
Oh, Iook at me.p

300
00:30:21,456 --> 00:30:23,583
AII we need
is the divorce.m

301
00:30:24,667 --> 00:30:28,588
I know how difficuIt your
situation must be untiI then,

302
00:30:29,839 --> 00:30:33,468
but, pIease, don´t make matters worse.
PIease, pIease, don´t go.

303
00:30:33,593 --> 00:30:36,387
Oh, I´II stay,
as you wish..

304
00:31:01,329 --> 00:31:02,747
Princess Sorokina.n

305
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:05,333
Your mama
is asking for you.f

306
00:31:05,541 --> 00:31:06,668
Good evening, mama.a

307
00:31:07,335 --> 00:31:08,753
I´m sorry to be Iate.m

308
00:31:09,337 --> 00:31:12,840
WeII, you´re here now,
and that´s aII that matters.

309
00:32:06,811 --> 00:32:09,314
You're not worthy of him.
You've lost your child! You're a whore.

310
00:32:10,648 --> 00:32:12,650
You're a whore!f

311
00:32:14,444 --> 00:32:16,487
You deserted him!.

312
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:44,265
Excuse me. You seem to be putting me
in the position of defendant. I was given

313
00:32:44,474 --> 00:32:49,437
to understand that Anna decIines a
divorce if I insist on keeping the boy.

314
00:32:49,646 --> 00:32:52,482
I repIied to her in that sense
and considered the matter cIosed.

315
00:32:52,815 --> 00:32:57,528
AIexei AIexandrovich,
you are a good man.

316
00:32:57,737 --> 00:33:00,156
Put yourself in
her position for a moment.

317
00:33:00,323 --> 00:33:01,783
She´s moved to Moscow.r

318
00:33:01,824 --> 00:33:05,787
She´s been there 6 months now,
each day expecting your decision.

319
00:33:05,828 --> 00:33:10,166
I´m a beIiever now. I can´t go against the
teachings of Christianity in such a matter.

320
00:33:10,333 --> 00:33:14,212
Why, divorce is sanctioned,
even by the church.c

321
00:33:15,838 --> 00:33:16,965
I must think it over.d

322
00:33:17,006 --> 00:33:19,467
I must seek guidance.s

323
00:33:30,353 --> 00:33:31,938
What do I see?n

324
00:33:34,857 --> 00:33:37,193
Ah, Yes. That´s right.o

325
00:33:37,694 --> 00:33:39,862
We must go away.
I Iong to be in the country,

326
00:33:40,613 --> 00:33:42,282
and there´s nothing
to keep you here, is there?

327
00:33:42,365 --> 00:33:46,452
-My one wish is to get away.
-You know, it came over me Iike an

328
00:33:46,494 --> 00:33:50,498
absoIute inspiration. Why shouId we
go on waiting here for the divorce?

329
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:54,168
I´ve made up my mind that it
shan´t infIuence my Iife anymore.

330
00:33:54,294 --> 00:33:56,879
-Do you agree?
-Oh, yes..

331
00:33:57,297 --> 00:33:59,215
WeII, how was
your dinner party?l

332
00:33:59,799 --> 00:34:01,509
Oh, the dinner
was first-rate

333
00:34:01,551 --> 00:34:03,803
and the boat race
and aII that quite enjoyabIe.

334
00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:05,805
WeII, when are we off?i

335
00:34:06,556 --> 00:34:07,807
The sooner the better.a

336
00:34:08,474 --> 00:34:10,643
We can´t get off
tomorrow, I´m afraid,

337
00:34:11,311 --> 00:34:13,313
but we couId be ready
the day after.

338
00:34:13,646 --> 00:34:15,315
Oh, no. Wait a moment.a

339
00:34:15,565 --> 00:34:17,817
The day after tomorrow is Sunday,
and I have to see mama.

340
00:34:18,401 --> 00:34:19,694
-You couId go there tomorrow.
- No, I´m going there on business

341
00:34:19,736 --> 00:34:23,990
to do with the power of attorney,
and the money won´t be ready tomorrow.

342
00:34:24,657 --> 00:34:26,659
In that case, then,
we won´t go at aII.

343
00:34:26,826 --> 00:34:28,244
I won´t go any Iater!
Monday or not at aII!n

344
00:34:28,328 --> 00:34:31,414
Why? There´s
no sense in that..

345
00:34:31,581 --> 00:34:33,666
You see no sense in it because...

346
00:34:34,334 --> 00:34:36,544
because you care
nothing for me.s

347
00:34:37,337 --> 00:34:38,338
You seem unabIe
to see my position.

348
00:34:38,421 --> 00:34:41,382
How do you think I feeI
cooped up in these rooms?

349
00:34:41,591 --> 00:34:44,677
But you are free.
Yes, you are free,

350
00:34:45,678 --> 00:34:48,598
and if you don´t Iove me anymore, that
wouId be better and more honest to say so.

351
00:34:49,265 --> 00:34:52,185
Oh, reaIIy! This
is becoming unbearabIe!e

352
00:34:52,268 --> 00:34:55,188
Why do you try my patience?
It has its Iimits.

353
00:34:56,189 --> 00:34:57,190
What do you mean
by that?f

354
00:34:57,273 --> 00:34:58,691
I mean...e

355
00:35:00,193 --> 00:35:01,277
I mean, weII,
what do you want of me?g

356
00:35:01,319 --> 00:35:04,322
What I want is that you shouId not desert
me as you are thinking of doing.

357
00:35:04,405 --> 00:35:07,784
No. I don´t want that.
what I want is your Iove,

358
00:35:08,409 --> 00:35:10,203
but it has gone,
so it is aII over.e

359
00:35:10,954 --> 00:35:11,788
Wait. Wait. Wait!

360
00:35:13,039 --> 00:35:14,832
What is this aII about?

361
00:35:15,291 --> 00:35:19,337
I said that me must put off our departure
for a matter of 3 days,

362
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:22,423
and you, Anna, sit by accusing me of
Iying and being dishonorabIe.

363
00:35:22,465 --> 00:35:27,303
It is a matter of compIete indifference to me
what your mother thinks and whom she

364
00:35:28,638 --> 00:35:30,223
wants to marry you to.t

365
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,225
But we´re not taIking
about that.

366
00:35:32,308 --> 00:35:34,227
PreciseIy about that!n

367
00:35:34,477 --> 00:35:37,313
I know aII about that
IittIe princess Sorokina,

368
00:35:37,564 --> 00:35:39,315
and Iet me teII you,
a heartIess woman..

369
00:35:39,357 --> 00:35:42,610
Be she oId or not oId, your mother or
anyone eIse is of no consequence to me,

370
00:35:43,278 --> 00:35:45,446
and I do not want to have
anything to do with her.

371
00:35:45,655 --> 00:35:48,283
I wiII not have you speak
disrespectfuIIy of my mother.

372
00:35:50,618 --> 00:35:51,619
There´s a Iimit
to my endurance.a

373
00:36:14,392 --> 00:36:16,185
Why didn´t I die?í

374
00:37:47,569 --> 00:37:51,864
Mashka is going
to eat your banana!n

375
00:38:41,497 --> 00:38:43,333
Who is that teIegram from?

376
00:38:43,499 --> 00:38:45,418
-It´s from Stiva.
-Can I see it?e

377
00:38:45,668 --> 00:38:46,794
It is addressed to me.m

378
00:38:46,836 --> 00:38:48,796
What secrets
can Stiva have from me?

379
00:38:48,838 --> 00:38:52,342
I don´t want you to see it because
Stiva has a passion for wiring.

380
00:38:52,425 --> 00:38:54,219
Why teIegraph
when nothing is settIed?

381
00:38:54,552 --> 00:38:55,428
He wires:.

382
00:38:56,721 --> 00:38:59,224
could get nothing out of him.
Promises definite answer soon.

383
00:38:59,349 --> 00:39:01,434
Read it yourself.e

384
00:39:01,726 --> 00:39:05,813
Little hope, and l'll do everything
possible and impossible.

385
00:39:08,733 --> 00:39:10,443
I don´t care about
the divorce anymore,

386
00:39:11,694 --> 00:39:13,529
And there was not the sIightest
necessity to hide this from me.

387
00:39:13,738 --> 00:39:16,574
I just want things
to be definite.l

388
00:39:16,741 --> 00:39:19,827
I am sure your irritabiIity is due to
the uncertainty of your position.

389
00:39:20,370 --> 00:39:23,498
And why did princess Sorokina
deIiver this teIegram?!

390
00:39:25,708 --> 00:39:27,585
She did not.t

391
00:39:29,462 --> 00:39:31,256
This arrived earIier
whiIe you were sIeeping.a

392
00:39:31,464 --> 00:39:34,509
Princess Sorokina came with the money
and the documents from my mother.

393
00:39:34,884 --> 00:39:36,511
I couIdn´t get them
yesterday.c

394
00:39:36,761 --> 00:39:39,806
I didn´t want anything
to deIay our departure.?

395
00:39:43,226 --> 00:39:44,185
By the way,r

396
00:39:44,310 --> 00:39:46,312
we are definiteIy
going tomorrow, aren´t we?

397
00:39:49,649 --> 00:39:51,401
You are...

398
00:39:51,568 --> 00:39:53,528
but not me.

399
00:39:58,324 --> 00:39:59,826
Ana, we can´t
go on Iike this.a

400
00:40:00,410 --> 00:40:02,495
You are, but not I!

401
00:40:02,579 --> 00:40:04,539
This is intoIerabIe!ã

402
00:40:06,833 --> 00:40:09,544
You wiII be sorry
for this.

403
00:45:25,568 --> 00:45:27,362
God,
forgive me everything.

404
00:45:39,415 --> 00:45:41,584
I have here...n

405
00:45:41,751 --> 00:45:45,296
the Iatest dispatch...
from the front!

406
00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:49,259
The infideI musIims
have been driven back!

407
00:45:54,389 --> 00:45:55,765
We russians...r

408
00:45:56,391 --> 00:45:57,267
have flown to helpr

409
00:45:58,518 --> 00:46:00,770
our Serbian Slavonic brothers,

410
00:46:01,729 --> 00:46:04,524
our fellow Christians!a

411
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:12,740
Count Vronsky.ç

412
00:46:12,782 --> 00:46:14,617
Perhaps you´d rather not have seen me.
If so, pIease don´t hesitate to say.

413
00:46:14,784 --> 00:46:16,619
I can aIways find
another compartment.

414
00:46:17,412 --> 00:46:19,747
No. PIease.o

415
00:46:22,292 --> 00:46:24,794
The Serbian war
is a blessing for me.

416
00:46:26,421 --> 00:46:29,465
As a man I have the merit that my
Iife is of no vaIue to me.

417
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:37,432
I´m gIad there´s something for which I may
Iay down the Iife which isn´t simpIy useIess,

418
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:39,559
but Ioathsome to me.o

419
00:46:41,269 --> 00:46:43,271
Anyone is weIcome to it.g

420
00:46:45,481 --> 00:46:47,358
I know the dreadfuI
thing you have suffered,

421
00:46:48,484 --> 00:46:50,695
But I beg you not to continue
on this course you are foIIowing.

422
00:46:51,279 --> 00:46:53,281
I am doing my duty
as a Russian...a

423
00:46:53,364 --> 00:46:54,490
and a Christian.a

424
00:46:55,283 --> 00:46:57,452
PIease, hear me out.

425
00:47:00,371 --> 00:47:03,291
I saw your Iady onIy once.s

426
00:47:06,294 --> 00:47:09,714
l wish l'd spoKen up then,
but l did not.

427
00:47:11,299 --> 00:47:14,385
which is why l cannot
remain silent now.

428
00:47:15,637 --> 00:47:18,306
Ever since the death
of my brother,ã

429
00:47:18,473 --> 00:47:21,476
aII I have been searching for are
answers to questions Iike,

430
00:47:22,644 --> 00:47:24,312
´´what am I?´´ , ´´why am I here?´´

431
00:47:24,812 --> 00:47:26,189
"What am l living for?"a

432
00:47:26,314 --> 00:47:28,191
When, suddenly,
it all became clear to me.

433
00:47:28,316 --> 00:47:32,320
l'd been living on spiritual truths
that l'd drunK in with my mother's milK,

434
00:47:32,403 --> 00:47:34,405
but l'd never
acKnowledged them.c

435
00:47:35,740 --> 00:47:37,825
I know what is right and wrong.
I wasn´t taught this..

436
00:47:38,326 --> 00:47:41,829
It was given to me, as it is to everyone.
I discovered nothing.

437
00:47:42,330 --> 00:47:44,499
I mereIy opened my eyes
to what I knew.t

438
00:47:47,335 --> 00:47:50,338
For me it is too Iate.i

439
00:47:50,421 --> 00:47:54,342
As a man, I am finished. As a weapon,
I may be of some use.

440
00:47:57,428 --> 00:47:59,389
Don´t think iII of me.

441
00:48:00,848 --> 00:48:03,351
I have Iost too much.d

442
00:48:04,561 --> 00:48:08,773
AII I ask is to be abIe
to remember Anna as she once was...

443
00:48:10,358 --> 00:48:12,360
when I first met her.e

444
00:48:12,860 --> 00:48:15,530
I try to bring back
those moments, but I cannot.r

445
00:48:17,365 --> 00:48:19,784
l cannot
see her face.m

446
00:48:21,369 --> 00:48:23,538
l can only see her
laid oute

447
00:48:23,705 --> 00:48:25,373
in the railway shed
where they tooK her.

448
00:48:27,375 --> 00:48:29,919
She was...a

449
00:49:03,661 --> 00:49:05,788
This newfeeling
has not changed me.m

450
00:49:05,830 --> 00:49:09,334
lt has not made me happy
and enlightened all of a sudden

451
00:49:09,584 --> 00:49:11,461
as l dreamed it would.p

452
00:49:11,586 --> 00:49:14,464
just liKe the way it was with
my feeling for my son.

453
00:49:14,589 --> 00:49:17,759
-Come to the nursery at once.
-Is something wrong with Mitya?

454
00:49:18,343 --> 00:49:19,761
There was no surprise
about this, either.

455
00:49:19,802 --> 00:49:23,264
-What´s going on?
-Mitya wants to see you.

456
00:49:23,348 --> 00:49:25,266
But be it faith or not.
l don't Know what it is.

457
00:49:25,350 --> 00:49:30,855
Through suffering, this feeling has crept
just as imperceptibly into my heart.

He knows me.

459
00:49:34,609 --> 00:49:37,612
and has lodged
itself firmly there.n

460
00:49:41,407 --> 00:49:45,328
l shall still be unable to understand
with my reason why l pray,

461
00:49:46,329 --> 00:49:49,540
and l shall
still go on praying.l

462
00:49:50,750 --> 00:49:52,752
But my llfe now...n

463
00:49:53,336 --> 00:49:56,548
my whole llfe... independent of
anything that can happen to me,

464
00:49:57,340 --> 00:50:01,761
every minute of it is no longer
meaningless as it was before,

465
00:50:02,512 --> 00:50:04,556
but has a positive meaning
of goodnesst

466
00:50:04,764 --> 00:50:08,560
with which l have
the power to invest it.e
