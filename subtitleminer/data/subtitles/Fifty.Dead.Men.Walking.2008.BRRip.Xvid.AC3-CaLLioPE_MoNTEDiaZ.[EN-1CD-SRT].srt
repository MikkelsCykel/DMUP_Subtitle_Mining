00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:00,202
His name is Martin McGartland,

2
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:04,748
and when I met him, he was an unemployed
Catholic hood selling stolen goods.

3
00:02:10,421 --> 00:02:13,841
These are a guarantee for action,
all for a couple of quid, like.

4
00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:16,343
- Take yourself off.
- Do you have a daughter?

5
00:02:17,929 --> 00:02:21,849
I had you down for something
a wee bit silky. Oh, come on, it's sexy.

6
00:02:23,518 --> 00:02:27,771
Martin helped support his family.
I liked that about him.

7
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:31,567
# OK, there's the trident in Bangor

8
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:33,360
# Then you walk back to the city

9
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:36,238
- We don't want any.
- Wait. Don't go.

10
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:39,158
Have you any Hugo Boss?

11
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:43,871
- Only the entire line at my fingertips.
- All right.

12
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:45,873
# An alternative Ulster

13
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:49,710
# Alternative Ulster #

14
00:02:53,464 --> 00:02:55,966
No, there's no way, man. No way.

15
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:58,427
Please?

16
00:02:58,553 --> 00:03:01,221
I'll do you nine
if you take the Hugo Boss for ten.

17
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:05,225
- Done. Do you wanna have a look, Lara?
- You know I'm not.

18
00:03:05,393 --> 00:03:08,770
Thank God there's you and the Pope
looking after our souls.

19
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:12,316
You're under the wrong impression.
These goods are not stolen.

20
00:03:12,483 --> 00:03:15,903
They're manufacturer overruns.

21
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:19,489
How about some shoes, Mrs Flaherty?

22
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:23,285
I can get you any shoes you like,
anything from this catalogue.

23
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:25,537
There's no point in me looking, love.

24
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:29,249
Well, not that I care
where it comes from.

25
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:32,711
Hmm. Hmm.

26
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:36,215
- Well, maybe next month.
- OK. Grand.

27
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,384
- Can I have another tenner?
- No, you cannot.

28
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:43,096
- Please.
- What did you do with that 20?

29
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,766
- I don't know.
- If there's anything you...

30
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:49,102
Jobs were generally controlled
by the Protestants,

31
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:53,482
which meant most of the young
Catholic men were unemployed,

32
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:56,193
...and angry about it.

33
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:59,154
Martin and his mate sean
had survived on the edge so long,

34
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:01,698
they didn't know any other way.

35
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:06,119
No way, man.
Who'd you kill for this, you wanker?

36
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:11,124
1800 twin cam.
Nought to 60 in seven seconds.

37
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,460
Outrun any peeler in the city.

38
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:16,046
The boot's a wee bit small,
but it'll do.

39
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:18,215
I can get you a deal anytime.

40
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:21,301
It's no use.
I can't afford the petrol.

41
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:23,387
And that's where I come in.

42
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:26,640
I was a peeler. That's what they call
the police in Belfast.

43
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:30,352
I was a handler with the special Branch.

44
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,187
My code name was Fergus.

45
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:39,194
Police made the first effort
to get marchers away from the area...

46
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:44,450
You see, by 1988, Belfast
had been a battleground for 20 years.

47
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:49,329
Irish Republican Army against
the Unionists' Ulster Defence Force.

48
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:53,834
Both were illegal armies.
It was about freedom.

49
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:56,503
Police barricaded all roads.

50
00:04:56,671 --> 00:05:00,173
Unionists want Northern Ireland
to stay as part of the UK.

51
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:02,968
Catholic Republicans
want free of British rule.

52
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:06,596
Both sides were willing to kill
for their cause.

53
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:11,977
By 1969, violence had become so bad,

54
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:15,272
British troops were sent in
to keep the peace.

55
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,357
They've been there ever since.

56
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:21,320
To the IRA,
they were also an occupying army.

57
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:24,197
B-20.
We have a report of sniper fire.

58
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:28,744
Two officers down. send available
blue lights to Falls Road area.

59
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:32,039
This is B-20 out.

60
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:35,625
- This is B-21...
- Is everybody all right?

61
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:39,963
- Outcome?
- Result.

62
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:43,717
...six shots fired.
Two officers down. Two casualties.

63
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:46,553
Go on, you mad bastard.

64
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:49,222
Tell the boys to pull out.

65
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:54,561
Two officers down,
two casualties. send blue lights.

66
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:55,729
Over.

67
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:03,570
K-9 response to Falls Road.
six shots fired.

68
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:06,698
Trying to locate gunmen. Looks IRA.

69
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:12,579
We had real respect for the IRA
as a military force.

70
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:15,374
We sealed the communities,

71
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:18,377
Protestants on one side of the walll
Catholics on the other.

72
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:20,587
We couldn't stop what was happening...

73
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:23,256
...because we didn't have
the minds of the people.

74
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:29,096
In war, truth is the first casualty, and
information is as powerful as bullets.

75
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:34,017
Growing up an Irish Catholic lad
in a Republican community...

76
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:38,397
...where police and security forces were
not trustedl Martin had few choices.

77
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:40,857
You've never done a day's work
in your life.

78
00:06:41,025 --> 00:06:44,403
But he was his own man, and so he had
real potential to work with us.

79
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:47,030
I don't think stealing cars
is employment.

80
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:48,990
Depends on how you look at it.

81
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:52,035
If the peelers catch you this time,
you're fucked.

82
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:56,790
- Tell me you didn't steal that car.
- I didn't steal that car.

83
00:06:56,916 --> 00:07:00,877
He could make a difference.
All I had to do was convince him.

84
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:03,547
- Where you off to, lads?
- Just going to the shops.

85
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:06,216
- All right. Name?
- Mickey Mouse.

86
00:07:06,342 --> 00:07:08,927
- What street are you from?
- Sesame Street.

87
00:07:09,053 --> 00:07:13,849
- No, Mickey Mouse is Disneyland.
- Aye, right, Disneyland, eh?

88
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:16,935
- Yeah, yeah. Where are you going?
- Didn't you hear him?

89
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:19,938
We're going to the shops.
It's me sister's birthday.

90
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:22,315
- We're getting her a present.
- A wee bike.

91
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:25,902
- Name.
- You fucking hard of hearing?

92
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:28,280
Mickey Mouse.

93
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,408
Are you gonna shoot him, is that it?

94
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:34,870
Now you're gonna shoot me?
First you and now it's me.

95
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:37,164
Go ahead, man. Shoot.

96
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:43,211
Go on, man. Fire away.
Fuckin' shoot me, man.

97
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:52,471
Is someone gonna do something
about this psycho here?

98
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:55,640
It's all right. Put it down.

99
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:58,435
Wait! After them, lads!

100
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:56,409
Peelers!

101
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:53,675
Fuck!

102
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:11,318
After doing 90 on the Shankill,
your mate Sean spun out,

103
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:15,155
took off before the officers chasing him
could say "wanker".

104
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:21,411
I gather you're in sales.

105
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:27,000
A bloke like you gets around the area.

106
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:33,298
Not me, man.
I make it a point to see nothing.

107
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:41,348
How about easy cash,

108
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:44,851
the kind that doesn't see you
going to jail for selling stolen goods?

109
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:49,856
I show you some faces,
you tell us what you see them doing.

110
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:55,528
What makes you think
that I would be a tout for anybody?

111
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:58,073
The comings and goings
of a few neighbours...

112
00:10:58,282 --> 00:11:02,118
...is not exactly being an informer,
or a "tout" as you call it.

113
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:07,040
A car. No record.

114
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,418
Not even on police files yet.

115
00:11:10,544 --> 00:11:15,131
Martin didn't go
for any of our usual offers or threats.

116
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:20,512
He sold stolen goods in Catholic areas
against strict IRA rules...

117
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:22,681
...which were brutally enforced.

118
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:24,974
Are we done? Can I go now, please?

119
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:27,227
He wasn't afraid of them.

120
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:31,272
Which is why I also knew
I could trust him.

121
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,985
- Well?
- I'll take him out on a road test.

122
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:40,865
If he's useless, I'll give him to MI5,
tell them he's bloody brilliant.

123
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:59,509
Whoa, ho, ho, ho! Jeez, Paddy.
You watching your family videos again?

124
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:02,053
Ray came by
to make your acquaintance.

125
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:05,223
Marty's been working for me.
Like I say, he's a good lad.

126
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:08,435
- Is he?
- Fuck this.

127
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:11,312
Didn't have anything on you, did they?

128
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:15,567
Here you go, Paddy. Oh, Jesus.
How you doin', Ray?

129
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:18,194
So, Martin,
Sean here says you're a good man.

130
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:21,656
- Look, man, I didn't see nothin'.
- That's true, you didn't.

131
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:24,951
And you'd do well to remember that.

132
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:28,496
I know your ma.
She's a good woman.

133
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:34,335
- Thanks for what you did today.
- Aye, no problem.

134
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:35,712
We'll not forget it.

135
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:38,715
Aye.

136
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:47,265
Sean, man, how do you know him?

137
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:49,309
- He's IRA.
- Is he, now?

138
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:51,186
- He is.
- Where's me money?

139
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:55,315
Paddy, is there any chance of getting
a pair of these in black? Size eight?

140
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:58,902
Oh, please, God, no.
It's a pipe! It's just a pipe!

141
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:02,489
The bathroom's just upstairs.
Do I look like I shot anybody?

142
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:03,698
Hey, hey!

143
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:06,659
What reason could you have
to search my house for guns?

144
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:09,454
Two officers have just been shot.
You're Irish.

145
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:12,332
- Where were you two hours ago?
- Playing football.

146
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,752
- Bullshit!
- You're only gonna make it worse!

147
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:18,004
I didn't raise you
to be thick as a plank!

148
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:21,883
If you were anywhere near this trouble,
I'll drag you to the police!

149
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:24,803
- I had nothing to do with it!
- Evil can only do its work...

150
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:28,306
...if decent people turn a blind eye,
even if only for a moment.

151
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:29,516
Keep searching!

152
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:33,353
He's made an impression
on the IRA for sure, right up the line.

153
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:37,524
From here on, I'm out.

154
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:40,944
Can't figure out what you'd want
with a 10p hood like him.

155
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:02,215
What's this? Huh? What's this?

156
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:05,301
Heading round your ma's house
to do a wee bit of fixing?

157
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:09,347
Wouldn't be for stealing cars, would it?
Not our Frankie.

158
00:14:09,473 --> 00:14:11,933
Breaking into people's houses? Yeah?

159
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:15,562
Yeah? Joyriding their cars?
Now I'm hearing about drugs.

160
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:19,983
These are crimes against the community,
my friend, and you've been found guilty.

161
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:24,070
It's not me. I swear.

162
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:28,032
What?

163
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:31,244
No! Help! Help!

164
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:35,623
- Fuck!
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!

165
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:38,084
What the...
What the fuck are yous after?

166
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:44,173
Is that it?
You're one lucky wee fucker, Frankie.

167
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:48,386
If I'd have brought my. 357, your
football career would've been done for.

168
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:51,973
You want this lying down or standing up?

169
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:55,602
- Standing.
- Right.

170
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:58,813
No! No! Fuckin' leave him!

171
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:00,732
- Leave him!
- My jeans.

172
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:04,986
Fuck yourjeans. The peelers mightn't
give a shite about our community...

173
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:08,031
...and how wankers like you
fuck it up for everyone,

174
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:12,327
but we do, so thank God for the IRA.

175
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:17,123
- You bastard!
- Frankie!

176
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:20,084
- Fucking bastard!
- That's my brother!

177
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,879
That's my wee brother! Frankie!

178
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:27,300
Funny coincidence running into you, huh?

179
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:31,471
Frankie! Frankie!

180
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:35,308
That's for getting involved
in something that doesn't concern you.

181
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:40,188
I'm assuming you've no plans for
this evening. Someone wants to meet you.

182
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,066
Fucking bastards!

183
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:52,450
Fred. Fred.
You know that kid Martin McGartland?

184
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:54,661
Well, I've taken a special interest.

185
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:57,956
Goddamn it.
That's been less than ten minutes.

186
00:15:58,165 --> 00:16:00,833
Who told you about the meeting
with Mickey Johnson?

187
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:03,127
Just lose the file.

188
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:05,380
And not a word to anyone, right?

189
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:07,590
Yeah, right.

190
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:20,937
Jesus Christ.

191
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:25,608
Sorry about the drama.

192
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,694
You've gotta be careful.

193
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:31,030
Would you get us some ice
and a tea towel there, love?

194
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:37,286
I hear the Brits
took your ma's house apart.

195
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:41,374
No warrant, no cause.

196
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:45,336
Picked you up for questioning.
Dogs have more rights.

197
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:52,218
Here. Thanks, love. Away and make
yourself a wee cup of tea there.

198
00:16:58,225 --> 00:17:01,269
I can see
you don't partake in loose talk...

199
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:05,857
...or I'd be behind bars now.

200
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,445
Seems to me like we're on the same side.

201
00:17:10,654 --> 00:17:13,281
You're a go-getter.
I've been asking around.

202
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:18,911
A kid like you deserves to work
at something, build a future.

203
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:22,248
Do you know why you can't get a job?

204
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:26,294
Because it makes you easier to beat.

205
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:29,172
The Brits underestimate us.

206
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:32,717
This war is being fought
on our own footpaths, in our gardens,

207
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,969
in our living rooms.

208
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:40,683
Makes for a special kind of man who's
defending his own home and community.

209
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:45,813
I'm thinking maybe
you'd wanna be part of something

210
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:49,108
that's bigger than your skinny wee arse.

211
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:52,278
Bigger than mine.

212
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:54,572
It's as big as a country.

213
00:17:58,118 --> 00:18:02,246
Well? Do you want the job?

214
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:06,501
OK.

215
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:10,129
Paddy's nothing but a wheeler-dealer.

216
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:12,799
That's a sure way
of getting your legs broken.

217
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:18,429
A fence is just a tout in training,
so you're finished with him, OK?

218
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:21,808
You got a car?

219
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:24,310
Aye, I do.

220
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:28,272
Mickey Johnson ran a taxi
company and was high up in the IRA,

221
00:18:28,398 --> 00:18:30,650
Drivers were a perfect way to recruit.

222
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:35,113
I knew Martin would be pissed off by
the IRA for taking out Frankie's knees.

223
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:39,367
Maybe he'd see Mickey's job as an
opportunity to get a car and to help us.

224
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:40,910
That was my hook.

225
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:45,081
In my world, timing is everything,
and occasionally we get lucky.

226
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:47,959
I've been asking around for you.
I'm glad you're OK.

227
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:50,461
I'm fine, no problem.

228
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:53,047
Come here, Frankie.
I'll get you in. You OK?

229
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:59,804
You'll be OK, man. Look at me, Frankie.
I'm sorry, mate, you know?

230
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:04,684
I wish I could have helped you, man.
There was nothing I could have done, OK?

231
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:08,437
Frankie's got an appointment
at the Royal. Bloody taxis. We're late.

232
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:10,648
I'm sure we've missed his doctor.

233
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:13,067
Next week
he goes on Tuesday and Thursday.

234
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:16,362
- Maybe I can give you a lift.
- You got a car?

235
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:17,905
Aye, definitely. Yeah.

236
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:20,491
That'd be brilliant,
wouldn't it, Frankie?

237
00:19:20,617 --> 00:19:25,037
- Tuesday'd be grand.
- I'll pick you up on Tuesday, OK?

238
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:27,331
- Four o'clock?
- Aye, definitely.

239
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:49,979
There's a right way and a wrong way
to do this. He's not in our pocket yet.

240
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:52,857
Pick him up.
Let's see what he's made of.

241
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:56,444
Worst case, he ends up
another statistic in jail or the morgue.

242
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:58,738
I don't see a downside.

243
00:19:59,948 --> 00:20:02,283
He doesn't listen. That's his problem.

244
00:20:02,492 --> 00:20:04,410
- Fuckin' wanker.
- Hey.

245
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:06,746
What did you say?

246
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:08,539
- Take him.
- Come here, love.

247
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:11,292
- What did you say?
- Don't be starting anything.

248
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:14,462
- Did you say something to me?
- Marty, just walk away.

249
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:18,257
Move on. OK, move on. Good man.

250
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:24,388
OK, why would you do that?
You're gonna point that at me now?

251
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:28,267
- Oh, my God! Marty, what are you doing?
- Why'd you do that? Are you sick?

252
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:31,020
Sick in the head? Is that it?
Sick bastard!

253
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:34,565
I had a wee baby in my arms!
I had a wee baby!

254
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:37,360
- Get back there!
- Against the wall!

255
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:40,321
Ma!

256
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:43,574
- Marty!
- You're coming with us right now.

257
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,451
- Fuck off.
- I'm his mother!

258
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:48,454
- Stay back.
- I was just walking. He kicked me.

259
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:51,958
Ma, I swear to God
I didn't do anything! I swear!

260
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:54,961
He's assaulted an officer
and he's going down to the station.

261
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:33,124
Bloody idiots were supposed to
pick you up, not start a riot.

262
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:35,251
What the hell's going on?
Are you setting me up?

263
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:38,170
A desperate man
goes to desperate measures.

264
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:42,842
I'm Fergus.

265
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:51,642
That's a terrible thing
happened to your mate Frankie.

266
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:57,231
I'm sure the sister, Lara, forgot
to tell you, her mother got the shoes.

267
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:58,858
Thinks you're a rock star.

268
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:05,114
Hopefully I've impressed you
with our thoroughness because...

269
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:07,366
I need your help.

270
00:22:08,535 --> 00:22:10,578
You met with Mickey Johnson.

271
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:17,460
- Never seen him.
- This is about lives and saving them.

272
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:20,546
They'll do to you what they did
to Frankie, only worse.

273
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:24,175
They're terrorists, killers who've found
a cause to kill for.

274
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:29,388
Terrorists? Is that what you think, huh?
Terrorists?

275
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:33,059
Well, I don't see anyone tearing up
your house 'cause you're Irish,

276
00:22:33,226 --> 00:22:37,563
hauling your arse out, getting the shit
kicked out of you by soldiers for fun.

277
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:39,023
Huh?

278
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:41,567
The Brits have never been in Ireland
by invitation,

279
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:43,861
so who's the fucking terrorist?

280
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:49,241
I'm offering you a job
you can feel good about.

281
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:53,120
They'll offer you a job
that'll likely get you killed.

282
00:22:53,288 --> 00:22:56,457
It's harder to live for your country
than die for it.

283
00:22:57,918 --> 00:23:01,420
A car's expensive.
My gift to you. No strings.

284
00:23:01,588 --> 00:23:05,716
You see,
I'm betting murder isn't in you.

285
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:10,096
Memorise this number,
then flush the card. Call me anytime.

286
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:14,058
Tell them your name's John Brown.
Ask for Fergus. They'll find me.

287
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:16,185
How do I know that's not bugged?

288
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:19,146
Well, why would we bother?

289
00:23:19,314 --> 00:23:22,316
One phone call, I know where you are.

290
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:33,619
You wanna give me money
and a car for nothing?

291
00:23:35,872 --> 00:23:37,498
That's fine by me.

292
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:04,984
Hop along, Frankie.

293
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:07,778
Give me those.

294
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:09,864
How'd you afford
a set of wheels?

295
00:24:10,031 --> 00:24:11,198
Because I got a job.

296
00:24:11,366 --> 00:24:15,786
- You? You got a real job?
- Aye, a real job. I'm a taxi driver.

297
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:19,123
- Where's your licence?
- You need a licence now, do you?

298
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:22,042
I thought we were in Belfast,
you wee shit.

299
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,380
This is brilliant.
Don't mind our Frankie.

300
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:29,049
He's fine.

301
00:24:31,511 --> 00:24:35,681
Listen, I was just wondering
if maybe I could take you out.

302
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:38,684
Maybe see a film
or grab some dinner or something.

303
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:41,020
Sure. Dinner?

304
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:42,563
OK.

305
00:24:42,772 --> 00:24:45,774
Look, I think I'm free on Thursday.
Is that OK?

306
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:48,194
- OK. You're on.
- OK.

307
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:53,908
Frankie, don't mind him.
He's got a real job.

308
00:24:54,075 --> 00:24:56,202
Oh, yeah, I forgot.

309
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:02,458
- So where are we going?
- The Europa Hotel, man.

310
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:06,795
Oh, I need you to pick my daughter up
for school in the morning. Is that OK?

311
00:25:06,963 --> 00:25:08,881
Aye, no problem.

312
00:25:10,717 --> 00:25:12,968
- Nice shirt.
- What, this?

313
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:15,513
- Hmm.
- I can pick one up for you if you like.

314
00:25:16,806 --> 00:25:18,432
Come on. It's not like that.

315
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:21,268
...so how do you like driving a taxi?

316
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:24,939
- It beats working for Paddy.
- No complaints about the hours?

317
00:25:25,148 --> 00:25:27,650
- I like it.
- You're one of my best drivers.

318
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:32,321
You're reliable. That counts for
everything. Know who you remind me of?

319
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:35,491
I don't remind you of anybody.
I'm not like anybody else.

320
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:38,744
My ma always said
I'm like one in a million.

321
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:42,331
- A million. That's what my ma told me.
- Aye, you're full of shit.

322
00:25:42,457 --> 00:25:44,875
- Who do I remind you of?
- Wee Aggie.

323
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:46,460
Who's Aggie?

324
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:50,798
I wouldn't trust him with my wife,
but I trust him with my life.

325
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:09,400
Ah! I've got
a bloody spring in me arse.

326
00:26:09,609 --> 00:26:12,236
No wonder your aunt gave you
this shitbox for free.

327
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:14,321
Up yours, man.

328
00:26:14,489 --> 00:26:17,157
I could have got you a deal
on a real car.

329
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:20,286
And end up with the peelers on my tail,
man? No, thank you.

330
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:22,871
You're a tube.

331
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:25,124
- There he is.
- Here he comes.

332
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:33,340
Sean, where are you going, man?

333
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:35,801
You'll catch up with Sean later.

334
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:39,263
If God is good and we're lucky.

335
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:45,185
We're going for a spin. Follow that car.

336
00:26:46,521 --> 00:26:48,897
It's a nice day.

337
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:57,239
Go north to the M5.
Head for Larne.

338
00:26:57,365 --> 00:27:00,826
Mate, I'm sorry,
but I was pretty much finished my shift.

339
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:02,911
I got a big, big night coming up.

340
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:05,623
You'll be finished
when I'm finished.

341
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:09,460
Fine. I'll just keep
my mouth shut, then, will I?

342
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:18,969
Turn left into that parking lot
there and park. Aye.

343
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:23,349
Just over there.

344
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:28,479
You stay here.
I'll look and be right back.

345
00:27:28,688 --> 00:27:31,899
And then you can get on
with your big night.

346
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:34,526
Now, is there a problem?

347
00:27:34,694 --> 00:27:36,779
- No problem.
- Good.

348
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:24,618
Good enough. Let's go.

349
00:28:36,297 --> 00:28:39,091
Hello, yeah.
Can I speak to Fergus, please?

350
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:44,304
My name? John. John Brown.

351
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:49,518
So whatever you wanna do.
Just wear something slinky.

352
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:53,063
It's a really fancy place.
I'll pick you up at eight, OK?

353
00:28:53,189 --> 00:28:57,067
All right, speak soon.
I'll be there at eight. All right, bye.

354
00:28:57,277 --> 00:29:00,070
- Sounds like Marty's got a date.
- I do, I do.

355
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,948
I'm sorry, Ray. You're just not invited.

356
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:06,660
Listen, take her...

357
00:29:07,787 --> 00:29:10,289
Take her somewhere nice. Yeah?

358
00:29:26,806 --> 00:29:30,184
- Oh, my God. It's on fire.
- Is it meant to do that?

359
00:29:30,393 --> 00:29:33,353
It's the chef's signature dish.

360
00:29:33,521 --> 00:29:36,482
Of course.

361
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:40,235
- It looks smashing.
- Aye, it does. It really does.

362
00:29:40,361 --> 00:29:42,321
- My pleasure.
- Thank you.

363
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:43,530
Thank you.

364
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:48,452
- So you never answered my question.
- What question was that?

365
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:51,497
- Don't duck it. You have an opinion.
- I'm not ducking.

366
00:29:51,664 --> 00:29:53,540
I'm not. I don't have an opinion.

367
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:56,502
You're Irish.
You were born with an opinion.

368
00:29:59,672 --> 00:30:01,632
What are you thinking?

369
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:05,260
I was thinking whether your ma
liked them shoes that I got her.

370
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:07,846
- That's what I was thinking.
- Yes.

371
00:30:08,014 --> 00:30:10,599
- She practically slept with them on.
- Did she?

372
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:12,851
You achieved sainthood.

373
00:30:14,854 --> 00:30:16,897
So?

374
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:20,234
How did we get
from me being thrown out of school

375
00:30:20,401 --> 00:30:22,653
to suddenly my belief in God, anyway?

376
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:28,116
Like, I wanna know about you.
Like, what's your favourite band?

377
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:33,705
OK, I'm not saying I don't believe
in God. I do believe in God.

378
00:30:33,873 --> 00:30:36,166
But he's probably not a Catholic God.

379
00:30:36,376 --> 00:30:38,418
I don't think God's sitting on a cloud

380
00:30:38,586 --> 00:30:43,507
trying to figure out whether he's
Protestant or Catholic or Buddhist.

381
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:48,136
Everyone's got big opinions about how
you should live and who you should love.

382
00:30:48,304 --> 00:30:52,683
The government, the peelers, the
Catholics, the Protestants, the Brits.

383
00:30:52,892 --> 00:30:54,560
I mean, any of them is full of it...

384
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:59,941
...if they think that they know more about
you or me or God than anybody else.

385
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:03,777
They're more interested
in killing than living,

386
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:07,948
which is hard enough to do,
keep up with the everyday shit.

387
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:17,082
Morrissey, Guns N' Roses,

388
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:19,710
the Pogues and U2, of course.

389
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:23,922
Jimmy Page is probably
one of the finest guitar players alive,

390
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:26,216
and Prince is great for having sex.

391
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:34,224
# Up on the roof
No fear of falling

392
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:41,565
# With my girl at my beck and callin'

393
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:47,779
# I kiss her once and hold her tightly

394
00:31:49,616 --> 00:31:54,620
# With a smile on my face
I know I could do this nightly

395
00:31:57,749 --> 00:32:01,585
# Her warm embrace
Her face excites me

396
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:33,617
- Where are we, anyway?
- Near Larne.

397
00:32:36,412 --> 00:32:39,957
You know, someone told me about
this pub. Do you wanna check it out?

398
00:32:41,417 --> 00:32:43,502
What's going on there?

399
00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:00,435
- Do you know him?
- I don't know him.

400
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:04,022
You, get back. Move it
out of here. Behind the line.

401
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:06,817
Go on, move it. Move it. Come on.

402
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:09,277
OK. We're moving.

403
00:33:09,445 --> 00:33:12,823
- Move it back now.
- Come on. Let's go.

404
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:16,368
- Move back.
- Under there. Come on.

405
00:33:27,797 --> 00:33:31,049
Did I ever tell you I wanted to
go to Disney World before I die?

406
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:35,137
Aye, you don't stop going on about it,
you and Minnie Mouse.

407
00:33:37,932 --> 00:33:40,767
Tell you what, give us a lift home.

408
00:33:40,935 --> 00:33:43,061
I always give you a lift.

409
00:33:45,815 --> 00:33:47,482
You rode Lara, didn't you?

410
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:54,156
You keep track of her period or you'll
be shopping for nappies. Good man.

411
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:57,367
- Taking advice from the model da?
- My kids are beautiful.

412
00:33:57,535 --> 00:34:01,079
Besides, being a da's not easy.
It's got its responsibilities...

413
00:34:01,247 --> 00:34:03,331
Fuck me. How you doin'?

414
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:07,252
That's a nice bum. Aye.

415
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:11,506
We sickened 'em today.
It's one for our side.

416
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:18,680
Look, you gotta expect a bit of killing,

417
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:21,266
a bit of dying in a revolution.

418
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:23,518
That's the way things work.

419
00:34:24,937 --> 00:34:28,398
Besides, you're not a man
unless you've got a cause.

420
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:30,692
Give us a lift.

421
00:34:37,992 --> 00:34:40,494
Two soldiers died.
Two are critical.

422
00:34:40,661 --> 00:34:43,622
- I didn't see anything.
- Why are you working for them?

423
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:47,375
I'm not working for them like that.
I've been driving Mickey around.

424
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:49,586
They asked me to pick up Quinn,
so I did.

425
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:52,923
- And they trust you?
- Like I said, it's not like that.

426
00:34:54,383 --> 00:34:56,301
Why?

427
00:34:59,305 --> 00:35:02,849
Well, you called me.
Why? What's different?

428
00:35:06,395 --> 00:35:11,942
Everything.

429
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:15,946
You can move on the inside.

430
00:35:19,158 --> 00:35:23,161
Dead men will be walking around
and becoming grandfathers...

431
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:24,663
...because of you.

432
00:35:25,414 --> 00:35:28,625
That's my community.
Like, I know some of these people.

433
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:32,045
Memorise this.

434
00:35:37,677 --> 00:35:40,345
Here's your petrol money.

435
00:35:55,194 --> 00:35:57,237
Thanks for the tea.

436
00:35:57,405 --> 00:35:58,655
Anytime.

437
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:09,124
Fuck! Stop him!

438
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,252
Hold it!

439
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:16,631
- Don't you fucking move!
- All right! Don't shoot!

440
00:36:16,799 --> 00:36:21,887
OK, lads, make sure you're at
the Upland place by 12 noon tomorrow.

441
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:25,307
Mickey, you take the back roads,
dump the cars there and split.

442
00:36:25,474 --> 00:36:29,227
Johnny will look after things here.
And, lads, make sure no one sees you.

443
00:36:29,395 --> 00:36:30,896
OK, let's go!

444
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:59,424
- It's an odds thing.
- What is?

445
00:36:59,592 --> 00:37:01,509
If the peelers get one of the cars,

446
00:37:01,677 --> 00:37:05,931
the other two are more likely
to get through if we're in a pack.

447
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:10,143
Besides, with cargo like this,
it keeps us all honest.

448
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:14,064
Shit.

449
00:37:19,153 --> 00:37:21,655
Sean, what are you doing, man?
Put that away.

450
00:37:21,822 --> 00:37:24,866
I'm serious. Put it away. Put it away.

451
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:28,078
If this thing blows,
I'll be Jesse fucking James.

452
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:38,964
Sean, you put that away, man.

453
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:41,591
Fucking put it away. Put it away.

454
00:37:45,137 --> 00:37:48,390
- That's quite a car.
- Yeah, it's my da's.

455
00:37:48,557 --> 00:37:52,060
Uh-huh. Where are you off to today, son?

456
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:54,980
We're just picking him up
at the airport, like.

457
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:59,526
- You're a long way out of your way.
- Well, we had to go to my sister's.

458
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:02,529
She's moving,
so we're just on our way back round.

459
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:05,365
- Can I see your licence, please?
- Aye.

460
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:13,206
I told my da to keep it in there.
He must have forgot.

461
00:38:13,374 --> 00:38:16,793
- Can I take a look in the boot, please?
- Aye, no problem.

462
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:28,805
You know what's happened?
This is a spare set of keys.

463
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:33,018
My da's got the main set.
It's not gonna work the boot.

464
00:38:33,185 --> 00:38:37,397
Tell you what. If I give yous a number,
maybe you could speak to my sister.

465
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:40,358
Have you got a pen?
I can write it down for you.

466
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:47,866
My da'll beat my arse if I'm late.

467
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:52,954
If you could just tell my sister you're
calling about Martin McGartland, OK?

468
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:04,466
Just wait here, mate.

469
00:39:26,906 --> 00:39:30,075
She says she has your keys.

470
00:39:30,242 --> 00:39:33,411
OK. Thank you. That's great. Thank you.

471
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:56,518
Whoo!

472
00:39:56,685 --> 00:40:00,480
They got nothing on us, they don't.
So who the fuck's your sister?

473
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:02,857
Uh, it was my ma. Fucking my ma!

474
00:40:03,025 --> 00:40:07,362
Your ma? Bloody hell.
My ma would have let them have me.

475
00:40:11,867 --> 00:40:13,952
Good work, man.

476
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:19,958
An RUC patrol
calling me like I was your sister?

477
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:23,461
- Come on. I was brilliant.
- stupid risks cost lives.

478
00:40:23,629 --> 00:40:25,171
Including yours.

479
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:28,133
So you're my da now? Just get the guns.

480
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:32,470
Today in Belfast,
residents of...

481
00:40:32,638 --> 00:40:36,474
Detectives said it was highly
significant and certainly curious,

482
00:40:36,642 --> 00:40:38,518
the weapons ranging from...

483
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:42,605
A haul of nearly 100 guns,
including Kalashnikov rifles,

484
00:40:42,731 --> 00:40:45,024
has been discovered by police...

485
00:40:45,192 --> 00:40:49,362
Three men were arrested,
believed to be connected to the IRA.

486
00:40:55,202 --> 00:40:57,078
Come on. Let's go.

487
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:58,997
- Who's that?
- He's a target.

488
00:40:59,165 --> 00:41:01,666
And what are you asking questions for?

489
00:41:19,518 --> 00:41:22,729
Listen, Marty,
it could just as easily be him

490
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:26,649
scouting you and your family. Go.

491
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:31,070
It's the Protestant church
up near North Road.

492
00:41:31,238 --> 00:41:33,740
The target's got three wee girls.

493
00:41:33,908 --> 00:41:35,116
What else?

494
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:40,538
Look, this guy's got a family as well.
He's just doing his job, you know?

495
00:41:42,416 --> 00:41:45,543
OK, Ray O'Brien is the shooter.
That's it.

496
00:41:46,545 --> 00:41:47,837
What about Sean?

497
00:41:47,963 --> 00:41:50,840
Look, I don't know nothing about Sean.
I told you that.

498
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:54,093
You don't get to pick and choose.
This is all in.

499
00:41:54,261 --> 00:41:57,805
Because I finger you, you're dead.
You finger me, I'm dead.

500
00:41:57,973 --> 00:42:01,267
So... there we are.

501
00:42:06,148 --> 00:42:08,733
I wanna show you something.

502
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:31,965
He has a kid. A ma, a da.

503
00:42:34,301 --> 00:42:36,386
- Is he a tout?
- A tout?

504
00:42:38,264 --> 00:42:41,641
He saved at least 30 lives,
probably more.

505
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:44,394
He's a goddamn hero.

506
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:49,566
Your mates tortured him for seven days,
168 hours, until we found him.

507
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:54,904
Sean doesn't get arrested.

508
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:59,659
A 400lb bomb was your mate's latest gift
to the city of Belfast,

509
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:03,329
seven people died,
and you don't want him arrested?

510
00:43:03,497 --> 00:43:06,916
Look, he's my mate. He's got
two kids from two different women.

511
00:43:07,042 --> 00:43:09,377
Aw! Give me a hanky.

512
00:43:11,213 --> 00:43:14,299
No way. I can't do it.
There's no deal. No way.

513
00:43:14,466 --> 00:43:16,384
Then there's no deal.

514
00:43:22,141 --> 00:43:25,059
What if I give you every detail
of every move he makes?

515
00:43:25,227 --> 00:43:27,312
You can shut him down, like.

516
00:43:27,479 --> 00:43:31,482
Come on. I'm into saving my mates
as much as yours.

517
00:43:32,359 --> 00:43:36,321
Look at him. Can't you just look at him?

518
00:43:40,409 --> 00:43:44,912
It's a dirty war, and everyone seems
to think the end justifies the means,

519
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:49,417
which is why you and your mate
are even walking around.

520
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:56,716
How do you know I can do it?

521
00:43:58,469 --> 00:44:00,887
You've got no choice.

522
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:03,348
Neither have I.

523
00:44:03,515 --> 00:44:05,183
I'm not looking for a da.

524
00:44:05,351 --> 00:44:11,022
Just... don't get yourself killed.

525
00:44:34,129 --> 00:44:36,089
- Hello.
- How you doing?

526
00:44:36,256 --> 00:44:39,550
Yeah, not bad.
It's a cold one, isn't it?

527
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:42,720
- Aye. That time of year, isn't it?
- Aye, definitely.

528
00:44:42,888 --> 00:44:44,472
- Is this all your gang?
- Yeah.

529
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:46,265
- Hi. What's your name?
- Jane.

530
00:44:46,433 --> 00:44:50,978
Jane, is it? Hello, Jane. I like
yourjacket, Jane. And what's your name?

531
00:44:51,188 --> 00:44:53,856
- Catherine.
- Catherine. And what about you?

532
00:44:54,024 --> 00:44:57,360
- You ready?
- You're cheeky, you are, aren't you?

533
00:44:57,528 --> 00:45:00,905
Aye. Anyway, take it easy.
Have a good one.

534
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:18,047
Martin.

535
00:45:21,427 --> 00:45:23,511
- What?
- I'm pregnant.

536
00:45:26,306 --> 00:45:28,307
Are you sure?

537
00:45:28,434 --> 00:45:33,646
I did a home pregnancy test,
and at the hospital... Yeah, I'm sure.

538
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:38,568
That's...
That's something, isn't it?

539
00:45:39,778 --> 00:45:43,072
- It's brilliant. It's fantastic.
- Really?

540
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:48,745
Come on.
What did you think I was gonna say?

541
00:45:48,954 --> 00:45:50,997
I don't know.

542
00:45:53,834 --> 00:45:58,045
- What about my ma?
- Oh, shit, your ma.

543
00:45:58,213 --> 00:46:00,298
Shit. My ma.

544
00:46:00,466 --> 00:46:04,469
Marty! I have the washing,
but I couldn't find that blue shirt.

545
00:46:04,636 --> 00:46:06,971
What were you doing with the blue...

546
00:46:08,056 --> 00:46:10,683
Lara, love, you can come out now.

547
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:20,693
Look, the two of yous are adults,
but if you get yourself pregnant,

548
00:46:20,861 --> 00:46:24,614
well, don't go expecting your parents
to treat you any different.

549
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:31,829
Oh, my. Well, then, I guess
a "congratulations" is in order.

550
00:46:33,999 --> 00:46:36,834
Your father wasn't much of a man
to look to, but you're not him.

551
00:46:37,002 --> 00:46:39,295
You'll do the right thing
or I'll kill you myself.

552
00:46:39,505 --> 00:46:43,716
- Ma, for Christ's sake.
- Well, I'll leave you to make a plan.

553
00:46:43,884 --> 00:46:46,594
- Sorry.
- There's lots to think about.

554
00:46:51,266 --> 00:46:53,142
Oh, shit.

555
00:46:57,523 --> 00:46:59,565
I was so worried.

556
00:47:01,401 --> 00:47:03,277
Me too.

557
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:07,156
You OK?

558
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:15,039
I'm not gonna piss off
like my own da, man.

559
00:47:15,165 --> 00:47:19,168
I'm gonna stick around, give the kid
a wee bit of advice here and there.

560
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:26,926
It's going down on Friday.
You gonna be ready?

561
00:47:27,094 --> 00:47:30,680
I'll be ready.
You're worse than my own ma.

562
00:47:30,889 --> 00:47:32,974
I just don't want you
to embarrass me, is all.

563
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,978
You wouldn't embarrass me, now,
would you?

564
00:47:43,443 --> 00:47:44,777
Wanker.

565
00:47:45,988 --> 00:47:47,905
So, lover boy, what are you gonna do...

566
00:47:48,073 --> 00:47:51,200
...when Lara's ma finds out
that you knocked up her daughter?

567
00:47:51,326 --> 00:47:54,412
Don't you worry about that one.
There's no way we're shacking up.

568
00:47:56,874 --> 00:47:59,375
I've got it.

569
00:47:59,501 --> 00:48:02,879
- Who is it?
- I don't know. I'm just getting it.

570
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:09,719
I've nowhere else to go.
My mummy, she found out.

571
00:48:14,933 --> 00:48:18,352
Aw, jeez, look,
we can't live here really.

572
00:48:20,105 --> 00:48:22,732
You want to shack up?

573
00:48:24,443 --> 00:48:27,695
Aye. Oh, aye, definitely. Come here.

574
00:48:29,531 --> 00:48:32,116
We'll be all right, huh, baby?

575
00:48:32,242 --> 00:48:35,411
Marty McGartland,
you're full of surprises.

576
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:39,081
Aye, I know. Now, come on. Get inside.

577
00:48:39,958 --> 00:48:43,669
- I've got school every day, so, like...
- Don't worry about that.

578
00:48:43,837 --> 00:48:46,797
I'm fully employed.
You know that. You know that.

579
00:48:48,342 --> 00:48:50,217
I love you.

580
00:48:52,846 --> 00:48:55,848
Me, too.

581
00:48:57,351 --> 00:48:59,435
At the Portsmouth ferry,

582
00:48:59,645 --> 00:49:02,897
there's a boatload of soldiers
going to England on the 18th.

583
00:49:03,065 --> 00:49:05,149
They're gonna hit the vans in the queue.

584
00:49:05,317 --> 00:49:09,320
Too many civilians for the boat itself
makes for bad press.

585
00:49:11,156 --> 00:49:13,491
Now, I know
they've got a shitload of Semtex,

586
00:49:13,659 --> 00:49:16,827
a load of weapons,
make sure this really goes off.

587
00:49:16,995 --> 00:49:19,580
- You know what Mickey said to me?
- What?

588
00:49:21,083 --> 00:49:24,877
He said he was so pleased
with the Upland operation...

589
00:49:25,045 --> 00:49:27,713
...that he's bumping me up to B Battalion.

590
00:49:27,881 --> 00:49:29,882
- Yes!
- I thought you'd like that.

591
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:32,551
- I like that.
- You know what else he said?

592
00:49:32,719 --> 00:49:35,513
- What?
- He's sending me to meet McFarlane.

593
00:49:35,681 --> 00:49:40,309
He... Oh, come on. It's bloody
brilliant. That's bloody brilliant.

594
00:49:40,435 --> 00:49:44,814
I'm here to prepare volunteers, in case
you get interrogated by the police.

595
00:49:45,023 --> 00:49:48,317
They'll come in banging in the night,
screaming to confuse you.

596
00:49:48,527 --> 00:49:52,154
Press this button
to get directly through to me.

597
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:54,448
Punch in a number, I call you.

598
00:49:55,242 --> 00:50:00,372
OK. Appliance of science, that's
brilliant. I like that. Very James Bond.

599
00:50:01,581 --> 00:50:06,043
Ask the duty sergeant to see the doctor
before they beat you.

600
00:50:06,211 --> 00:50:10,798
The harder they hit,
the harder you hit back.

601
00:50:10,966 --> 00:50:14,593
Curl up in a ball and protect your head.
You'll need it.

602
00:50:14,761 --> 00:50:18,139
Unless, of course, they cuff you,
in which case you're fucked.

603
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:23,227
- I know what I'm doing.
- Oh, yeah?

604
00:50:23,353 --> 00:50:27,231
You know, they'll hold your head
underwater till your eyes are spinning.

605
00:50:27,357 --> 00:50:29,483
Again and again, for a couple of hours.

606
00:50:29,651 --> 00:50:31,736
If they won't let you go to the toilet,

607
00:50:31,903 --> 00:50:34,447
strip right down
in front of them and take a shit.

608
00:50:34,614 --> 00:50:37,199
They'll squeeze your balls
with a pair of pliers,

609
00:50:37,367 --> 00:50:39,577
twist your thumbs out their sockets.

610
00:50:39,745 --> 00:50:41,078
OK, man, like, I get it.

611
00:50:41,246 --> 00:50:44,206
You say one thing,
they'll have you for seven years.

612
00:50:44,374 --> 00:50:46,792
You'll say whatever they want
to make it stop.

613
00:50:46,918 --> 00:50:52,506
Think, outsmart them,
but never underestimate them.

614
00:50:52,674 --> 00:50:57,261
You admit to anything, you'll end up in
a ditch with a cattle prod up your arse.

615
00:50:57,387 --> 00:51:02,683
My car's marked, right? You bugged
my place. I've got this wee buzzer here.

616
00:51:02,851 --> 00:51:05,311
Look, there's someone on my tail
24 hours a day.

617
00:51:05,479 --> 00:51:08,189
Yeah, but it doesn't mean I don't worry.

618
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:18,574
I'd get up there if you would,
but there's no way I'm going on my own.

619
00:51:19,493 --> 00:51:22,661
The British found out
about the Portsmouth operation.

620
00:51:22,788 --> 00:51:24,872
No shit.

621
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:29,210
So, ladies,
what are we celebrating, then?

622
00:51:29,377 --> 00:51:33,005
- We just passed our exams, a wee bit.
- Aye. This one got here two As.

623
00:51:33,173 --> 00:51:35,091
- And a B.
- Two As and a B.

624
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:37,051
Well, cheers to that.

625
00:51:37,219 --> 00:51:38,260
Cheers.

626
00:51:39,971 --> 00:51:45,601
Mm. Don't you worry about this.
I'll go and get the next round.

627
00:51:45,811 --> 00:51:48,104
- Give us a hand, Marty.
- Sean, I don't drink.

628
00:51:48,313 --> 00:51:50,397
Give us a hand. I know you're not.

629
00:51:50,565 --> 00:51:52,441
Sorry.

630
00:51:53,944 --> 00:51:55,986
Two lagers, please.

631
00:51:59,241 --> 00:52:01,325
There's a fucking leak.

632
00:52:03,829 --> 00:52:07,414
They got everything.
Bloody waste of Semtex, it was.

633
00:52:09,167 --> 00:52:13,045
- Brit blood would've spilled.
- Aye, Jesus Christ, what a waste.

634
00:52:13,213 --> 00:52:17,216
If we didn't have bad luck,
we'd have no fucking luck at all.

635
00:52:17,342 --> 00:52:19,468
Fucking peelers, man.

636
00:52:20,971 --> 00:52:24,890
Peeler, yeah. It's times like this,

637
00:52:25,058 --> 00:52:30,104
it makes you think about your family
and puts it all into perspective.

638
00:52:30,272 --> 00:52:33,399
I wanna see my damn kids, you know.

639
00:52:33,567 --> 00:52:35,484
Anyway...

640
00:52:38,989 --> 00:52:43,325
- What's with him?
- He's just drunk.

641
00:52:43,493 --> 00:52:45,744
- Feel that?
- Did it kick? Is it kicking?

642
00:52:45,871 --> 00:52:48,706
- It's a ballerina in there.
- That is a footballer.

643
00:52:48,874 --> 00:52:50,457
- Ballerina.
- Footballer.

644
00:52:50,625 --> 00:52:53,210
- Let's go home and fight about it.
- OK.

645
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:55,921
Did you know
pregnant girls are extra horny?

646
00:52:56,089 --> 00:52:58,841
- Let's definitely go home, then.
- Let's go.

647
00:53:00,302 --> 00:53:02,386
You make me look brilliant.

648
00:53:02,554 --> 00:53:06,307
I couldn't dodge this meeting.
Head of security'll be there.

649
00:53:06,474 --> 00:53:10,227
- You don't think they're onto me?
- No, they're gonna test you.

650
00:53:10,395 --> 00:53:14,481
Do whatever they ask. If they suspect
you're not 100%, you'll be out or dead,

651
00:53:14,649 --> 00:53:17,735
and, well, we have no one
moving up the inside like you.

652
00:53:17,903 --> 00:53:19,111
Aye. OK.

653
00:53:19,279 --> 00:53:22,156
I'll meet you at five,
usual place. Good luck.

654
00:53:32,334 --> 00:53:34,418
Cut him down.

655
00:53:40,842 --> 00:53:43,928
Sean. Sean. Come on, let's get out.

656
00:53:44,846 --> 00:53:48,933
- I wanna hear him say it.
- He'll say anything right about now.

657
00:53:55,106 --> 00:53:57,942
- What are you gonna do with that?
- Relax, relax, relax.

658
00:53:58,777 --> 00:54:00,861
You're a good lad.

659
00:54:02,656 --> 00:54:07,284
I wanna know about the operation
on Portsmouth, what you told the cops.

660
00:54:07,452 --> 00:54:10,746
I don't know anything
about the operation.

661
00:54:17,212 --> 00:54:19,880
- What did you tell them?
- Nothing.

662
00:54:20,048 --> 00:54:25,761
Both teams are being very
cautious. Nobody is taking the chance.

663
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:28,764
- What's the score, Sean?
- It's nil-nil.

664
00:54:32,811 --> 00:54:34,645
No! No!

665
00:54:37,065 --> 00:54:39,108
How'd the cops
get you to talk?

666
00:54:41,778 --> 00:54:43,821
Money?

667
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:47,700
It's not much good to you now, is it?

668
00:54:48,785 --> 00:54:51,495
What are you gonna do with those?

669
00:54:52,372 --> 00:54:54,999
- You're a tout. What are you?
- I'm not! I'm not!

670
00:54:58,003 --> 00:55:00,087
- What are you?
- Nothing!

671
00:55:03,341 --> 00:55:07,344
- What are you?
- A tout.

672
00:55:07,512 --> 00:55:09,346
A tout.

673
00:55:11,141 --> 00:55:14,184
Sean, Sean, turn that off.

674
00:55:14,394 --> 00:55:17,062
All right, lads, listen up.

675
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:19,356
Speak into that.

676
00:55:24,529 --> 00:55:28,866
I'm a tout.
Just tell my mum I said sorry.

677
00:55:29,659 --> 00:55:32,036
Just tell her I'm sorry.

678
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:35,706
Good man.

679
00:55:36,583 --> 00:55:39,251
Marty. Marty, come here.

680
00:55:43,214 --> 00:55:47,640
He's a tout.

681
00:55:53,808 --> 00:55:55,893
Stiff him.

682
00:56:02,817 --> 00:56:07,196
- Don't, please.
- Come on, brother. We haven't all day.

683
00:56:07,405 --> 00:56:09,531
Do it! Just fucking do it!

684
00:56:09,699 --> 00:56:12,201
No, don't! Don't kill me! Don't!

685
00:56:15,246 --> 00:56:17,247
What the fuck was that about?

686
00:56:17,415 --> 00:56:19,541
It's my operation.

687
00:56:19,667 --> 00:56:21,710
He's my tout.

688
00:56:24,631 --> 00:56:26,715
Get him out of here.

689
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:32,304
You... clean up this mess.

690
00:56:47,821 --> 00:56:51,031
- You knew this was gonna happen.
- And you didn't?

691
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:55,244
- They completely trust you now.
- I had a gun at his head, like.

692
00:56:55,453 --> 00:56:58,205
You said I couldn't do it,
I didn't have murder in me.

693
00:56:58,373 --> 00:57:01,125
I was so scared, I swear to God,
I might have done it.

694
00:57:01,292 --> 00:57:03,961
I lied.

695
00:57:04,129 --> 00:57:06,380
We all have murder in us.

696
00:57:06,548 --> 00:57:08,132
You?

697
00:57:08,258 --> 00:57:10,342
The hunters become the hunted, yes.

698
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:13,470
Is that what you tell yourself
to make it all OK?

699
00:57:13,638 --> 00:57:18,142
The price of a conscience is death.
None of us can afford it.

700
00:57:23,022 --> 00:57:27,317
They're swearing me in.
I'm gonna be a full volunteer.

701
00:57:27,485 --> 00:57:32,281
Do you have any idea what that means
to the next person you're going to save?

702
00:57:34,325 --> 00:57:38,912
I've put a block on your house.
It means it's off limits to the peelers.

703
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:43,542
Store weapons for the IRA, we'll trace
'em every time they're moved.

704
00:57:45,378 --> 00:57:48,297
89, Cutland Road, right?

705
00:57:49,215 --> 00:57:52,801
There's an RUC officer
who's gonna be hit by Friday.

706
00:57:54,012 --> 00:57:56,597
They're gonna blow him up
with a car bomb.

707
00:57:58,766 --> 00:58:01,393
Now, is that it?
I'd like to get out now, please.

708
00:58:21,414 --> 00:58:24,208
I don't blame the RUC

709
00:58:24,334 --> 00:58:28,712
for turning my son into an informer.

710
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:33,467
I don't blame the IRA for killing him.

711
00:58:34,886 --> 00:58:38,931
I blame me son for the choice he made...

712
00:58:39,098 --> 00:58:43,936
...to go against his family
and his community.

713
00:58:53,863 --> 00:58:59,368
It doesn't get any easier, son.
It's all about saving lives, isn't it?

714
00:58:59,536 --> 00:59:02,162
It's gotta be done.

715
00:59:02,330 --> 00:59:06,750
I dream that one day we'll walk
as free men in our own country.

716
00:59:06,918 --> 00:59:11,255
The British have made us
into their poor, stupid cousins.

717
00:59:11,422 --> 00:59:14,508
The IRA is here to show them
that an ounce of resistance...

718
00:59:14,634 --> 00:59:17,010
...is worth a pound of votes.

719
00:59:17,178 --> 00:59:18,845
Do you know who said that?

720
00:59:19,013 --> 00:59:21,223
- No.
- Bobby Sands.

721
00:59:21,349 --> 00:59:25,644
He was quoting Vladimir Lenin,
mastermind of the Russian revolution.

722
00:59:27,855 --> 00:59:31,400
He changed the world and built a nation.

723
00:59:45,790 --> 00:59:48,333
You've been through
the lectures and the books?

724
00:59:48,501 --> 00:59:49,543
Aye.

725
00:59:49,669 --> 00:59:51,920
- Have you been green-booked?
- Aye.

726
00:59:52,088 --> 00:59:56,800
Then you know volunteers who engage
in loose talk shall be dismissed.

727
00:59:56,926 --> 01:00:00,637
Volunteers found guilty of treason
face the death penalty.

728
01:00:00,805 --> 01:00:02,889
I understand.

729
01:00:03,057 --> 01:00:07,603
This is no picnic.
You'll end up dead or in jail.

730
01:00:09,147 --> 01:00:12,941
There's no going back.
Once you're in, you're in.

731
01:00:13,109 --> 01:00:16,194
You understand your responsibility
in the community?

732
01:00:16,362 --> 01:00:18,989
People look up to you.
Behave accordingly.

733
01:00:20,825 --> 01:00:26,163
You've already passed their security,
and Mickey says you're a good lad, so...

734
01:00:31,628 --> 01:00:34,421
I, Martin McGartland,

735
01:00:34,589 --> 01:00:37,841
promise to promote the objects
of the glaigh na hireann...

736
01:00:38,009 --> 01:00:40,969
...to the best of my knowledge and ability,

737
01:00:41,179 --> 01:00:45,349
to obey all orders and regulations...

738
01:00:45,475 --> 01:00:50,646
...issued to me by the army authority
and by my superior officer.

739
01:00:51,981 --> 01:00:57,069
Martin McGartland, you are now a full
volunteer of the Irish Republican Army.

740
01:00:58,279 --> 01:01:01,365
- Congratulations.
- Thank you. Thank you.

741
01:01:04,744 --> 01:01:06,995
Come on. Come on.

742
01:01:13,252 --> 01:01:15,379
I'm proud of you, son.

743
01:01:17,006 --> 01:01:20,926
The fuckin' Brits
took my son away from me.

744
01:01:21,135 --> 01:01:24,304
I will never let that happen to you.

745
01:01:24,472 --> 01:01:27,891
OK?
Sorry.

746
01:01:30,895 --> 01:01:33,230
- Big things next year.
- Aye, OK.

747
01:01:33,356 --> 01:01:35,399
- You'll be a hero.
- Yeah.

748
01:01:44,283 --> 01:01:46,576
Don't mess this up, Marty.

749
01:01:47,995 --> 01:01:50,247
Come on, man, give us my flag.

750
01:01:50,415 --> 01:01:52,541
You'll have it when you're dead.

751
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:56,962
Marty, hang about.
There's someone I want you to meet.

752
01:02:00,633 --> 01:02:05,595
Listen, one of our top operatives
needs a right-hand man, OK?

753
01:02:08,141 --> 01:02:12,602
Hello, gents. This the Marty
you've all been talking about?

754
01:02:14,605 --> 01:02:19,401
- They call me Grace.
- Hi. I'm Marty. It's a pleasure.

755
01:02:19,569 --> 01:02:22,696
- Marty's gonna enjoy this assignment.
- Yeah, OK.

756
01:02:27,201 --> 01:02:29,077
Grace Sterrin.

757
01:02:29,287 --> 01:02:31,580
Oh, aye.

758
01:02:32,915 --> 01:02:35,834
- What, you know her, do you?
- I know Grace, yeah.

759
01:02:36,043 --> 01:02:39,296
Then you'll know
she's a nice, nice, nice-looking lady.

760
01:02:39,464 --> 01:02:41,548
We've been trying to get her for years.

761
01:02:41,716 --> 01:02:44,801
She's senior intelligence.
Uses her body like Mata Hari.

762
01:02:45,011 --> 01:02:47,304
I mean, I would have to be forced.

763
01:02:47,472 --> 01:02:50,307
I would consider...
I would definitely give her one.

764
01:02:50,475 --> 01:02:53,226
- You and a few others.
- You would as well, would you?

765
01:02:53,394 --> 01:02:55,812
- Wouldn't you like to know?
- I would, yeah.

766
01:02:55,980 --> 01:02:58,023
Wouldn't you like to fucking know?

767
01:02:58,191 --> 01:03:01,109
I don't wanna know
what's going on in your dirty mind.

768
01:03:01,319 --> 01:03:05,572
She's a big fish,
which means she makes everyone nervous.

769
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:09,326
People are idiots when they're nervous.
That makes them easy.

770
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:24,508
- OK, stay outside.
- Mickey told me I could come in.

771
01:03:24,675 --> 01:03:27,135
He's a worrier.
Nothing's gonna happen.

772
01:03:27,345 --> 01:03:29,888
Mickey said, so I've got to do it, OK?

773
01:03:30,056 --> 01:03:35,018
If I'm not out in ten minutes, go home,
'cause it means I'm dead, OK?

774
01:03:35,728 --> 01:03:37,813
- Hiya.
- Hi.

775
01:03:38,856 --> 01:03:40,732
Cheers.

776
01:03:44,612 --> 01:03:49,199
You've reached the home of Lara
and Marty. Please leave a message.

777
01:03:49,408 --> 01:03:53,119
Lara, it's me. Just letting yous know
I'm not gonna be too much longer.

778
01:03:53,246 --> 01:03:55,539
I'll be home pretty soon, OK?

779
01:03:55,665 --> 01:03:59,251
And I was also wondering if there was
any chance you could make me...

780
01:03:59,418 --> 01:04:02,629
...that special apple crumble
that you make?

781
01:04:02,797 --> 01:04:07,259
If you could get that going for dessert,
that would make a working man happy.

782
01:04:07,426 --> 01:04:09,302
Apple crumble?

783
01:04:11,013 --> 01:04:12,597
Listen, I gotta go. OK, bye.

784
01:04:14,851 --> 01:04:17,644
You really shouldn't knock it
till you try it.

785
01:04:17,812 --> 01:04:20,063
- I don't cook.
- What happened in there?

786
01:04:20,231 --> 01:04:23,441
- Like, it didn't take very long.
- I got what I came for.

787
01:04:24,569 --> 01:04:27,988
Want to meet me for a drink later?
Purely social.

788
01:04:28,155 --> 01:04:31,825
I'd love to, but I just don't think
it's a very good idea.

789
01:04:31,993 --> 01:04:33,702
Aye, apple crumble.

790
01:04:33,870 --> 01:04:35,745
Apple crumble.

791
01:04:38,666 --> 01:04:41,459
I really do have
a pretty serious girlfriend.

792
01:04:41,627 --> 01:04:44,921
She's pregnant, and we're
living together and everything.

793
01:04:45,089 --> 01:04:47,549
Just thought a wee drink would be fun.

794
01:04:49,343 --> 01:04:51,219
Here.

795
01:04:56,559 --> 01:05:00,896
Take this to Allan in Turf Lodge.
I told him you'd have it there by one.

796
01:05:01,105 --> 01:05:03,857
If you're late, he'll be thinking
you're up to something.

797
01:05:26,797 --> 01:05:29,758
Jesus Christ!

798
01:05:29,967 --> 01:05:32,552
Man, were you following me?
They gave me this.

799
01:05:32,678 --> 01:05:35,931
When you jumped the ladder,
a platoon started following you.

800
01:05:36,140 --> 01:05:38,141
Next time, take your car.

801
01:05:41,187 --> 01:05:45,607
I have about 12 minutes before
they think I stopped to copy that.

802
01:05:45,775 --> 01:05:49,235
These are prison guards at Maze.
What's this schedule? Football?

803
01:05:49,403 --> 01:05:52,989
I don't have time to talk. Can we just
move on? I've got to get out.

804
01:05:53,199 --> 01:05:55,575
- Lara's water broke.
- What?

805
01:05:55,743 --> 01:05:58,912
Don't worry.
Her ma's taking her to the hospital.

806
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:03,041
Shit. Shit, shit, shit. Her ma took her?

807
01:06:03,209 --> 01:06:07,170
Yeah. Even mothers forgive
when it comes to grandchildren.

808
01:06:07,296 --> 01:06:09,714
This is not good.
This is not, not good.

809
01:06:09,882 --> 01:06:13,635
Oh, man, now I've gotta drop this off
before I can get up to the hospital.

810
01:06:13,803 --> 01:06:16,137
Look, Fergus, will you come?

811
01:06:18,808 --> 01:06:20,308
Shit!

812
01:06:25,982 --> 01:06:29,317
It's about time you showed up.
Are you ready to be a da?

813
01:07:01,434 --> 01:07:04,728
- Two sugars.
- That's perfect. Thank you. Brilliant.

814
01:07:10,776 --> 01:07:14,362
Listen, Fergus, thank you so much
for coming. It means so much to me.

815
01:07:14,572 --> 01:07:16,656
Thank you.

816
01:07:17,992 --> 01:07:21,870
I'm telling you, it's just... It really
has just been amazing, you know?

817
01:07:22,038 --> 01:07:25,665
Yeah. I remember
the day my Johnny was born.

818
01:07:27,251 --> 01:07:29,627
Yeah, it's quite something.

819
01:07:29,754 --> 01:07:33,631
We don't see too much of each other now.

820
01:07:33,799 --> 01:07:35,884
Casualty of the business.

821
01:07:37,887 --> 01:07:41,264
We've already moved the officers
off that list. But don't worry.

822
01:07:41,390 --> 01:07:45,393
We've relocated all the officers,
making it look routine. You're covered.

823
01:07:45,603 --> 01:07:47,896
OK.

824
01:07:48,105 --> 01:07:49,898
Hey.

825
01:07:50,066 --> 01:07:51,441
Oh, OK.

826
01:07:51,609 --> 01:07:54,611
Well, we have to wet the baby's head.

827
01:07:54,779 --> 01:07:57,280
Yes, we do. We absolutely do.

828
01:07:58,741 --> 01:08:01,117
That is a very, very good plan.

829
01:08:01,243 --> 01:08:04,412
Oh, I've got a few plans up me sleeve.

830
01:08:04,580 --> 01:08:06,790
My God, I need that.

831
01:08:06,957 --> 01:08:11,044
- What's his name?
- He's Patrick. Wee Patrick.

832
01:08:11,212 --> 01:08:13,296
- Patrick.
- Aye.

833
01:08:15,424 --> 01:08:18,384
Well, cheers, Patrick.

834
01:08:18,552 --> 01:08:21,805
You've got one hell of a father.

835
01:08:21,972 --> 01:08:24,057
So does Johnny.

836
01:08:26,143 --> 01:08:29,229
- Hey, Marty.
- Jeez, Sean.

837
01:08:29,396 --> 01:08:31,773
- Marty.
- Sean, what are you doing?

838
01:08:31,941 --> 01:08:34,484
- How you doing, man?
- Check it out. I'm a da!

839
01:08:34,610 --> 01:08:38,029
- Who the fuck is that?
- He's just some happy uncle.

840
01:08:38,155 --> 01:08:40,281
Check him out. Come on.

841
01:08:41,492 --> 01:08:43,660
- Look at that.
- What's his name?

842
01:08:43,828 --> 01:08:45,912
- He's Patrick.
- Patrick.

843
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:49,457
He's got lovely eyes, just like mine.

844
01:08:49,625 --> 01:08:51,960
- What are these?
- They're fucking shoes.

845
01:08:52,128 --> 01:08:55,130
Well, they're, uh... they're lovely.

846
01:08:56,549 --> 01:08:57,757
# Babylon's burning

847
01:08:58,634 --> 01:09:00,718
# You'll burn the street

848
01:09:01,470 --> 01:09:04,222
# You'll burn your houses

849
01:09:04,348 --> 01:09:06,474
# With anxiety

850
01:09:09,562 --> 01:09:12,814
But roughly a third
was intercepted by the police.

851
01:09:12,982 --> 01:09:17,026
The device was primed and
booby-trapped, and police found it...

852
01:09:17,153 --> 01:09:19,571
A bomb factory equipped for...

853
01:09:19,697 --> 01:09:22,323
Nearly 100 guns
have been discovered...

854
01:09:22,533 --> 01:09:25,577
Come on! Hand it over!

855
01:09:25,786 --> 01:09:29,706
# Babylon's burning
Babylon is burning

856
01:09:30,124 --> 01:09:32,667
# Babylon is burning
Babylon is burning

857
01:09:32,835 --> 01:09:34,919
# Babylon's burning #

858
01:09:41,260 --> 01:09:43,344
I didn't hear you come in.

859
01:09:44,555 --> 01:09:46,472
Obviously.

860
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:48,766
It's not what it seems, OK?

861
01:09:48,934 --> 01:09:53,146
Don't bullshit me.
You think I don't know what you do?

862
01:09:53,314 --> 01:09:56,566
It's just for a few days, that's it.

863
01:09:56,734 --> 01:09:59,444
It's the RA,
and if not them, the peelers.

864
01:09:59,612 --> 01:10:03,948
Between the two, you'll end up either
dead or in jail, and then what about us?

865
01:10:05,993 --> 01:10:10,413
What do you mean, what about us?
It's just for a few days, that's all.

866
01:10:14,126 --> 01:10:17,170
You have to decide, because we're not
waiting around for the call...

867
01:10:17,338 --> 01:10:21,090
...that they've found you in a ditch
with a bullet hole in your head.

868
01:10:26,263 --> 01:10:28,139
Thank you.

869
01:10:35,940 --> 01:10:38,650
We've got to go to Scotland?
For how long?

870
01:10:38,776 --> 01:10:42,612
Three days. Grace is checking out
a Libyan shipment of weapons.

871
01:10:42,738 --> 01:10:46,616
- We're her security.
- So we're meeting a Libyan gun dealer?

872
01:10:46,742 --> 01:10:49,202
How do we know
if they're Libyans?

873
01:10:49,370 --> 01:10:53,790
Usually they shave their heads.
And they're probably eating couscous.

874
01:10:53,958 --> 01:10:57,168
- That's not true.
- You don't know what couscous is.

875
01:10:57,336 --> 01:10:59,963
- They put curry sauce on it.
- The Libyans do?

876
01:11:00,130 --> 01:11:05,426
Aye, they do. It's disgusting.
They've got awful breath, they do.

877
01:11:05,594 --> 01:11:08,054
- Is that true?
- It's a fact.

878
01:11:14,770 --> 01:11:16,479
He said that?

879
01:11:16,647 --> 01:11:21,567
He actually said he wanted me to take
over the entire operation on me own?

880
01:11:21,735 --> 01:11:24,237
- You're ready.
- Jeez.

881
01:11:28,575 --> 01:11:30,660
What about Sean?

882
01:11:34,957 --> 01:11:37,709
OK, fair point. Fair point.

883
01:11:38,711 --> 01:11:41,671
Thank you for not making me say it.

884
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:46,134
And did you have something to do with
this as well? Did you speak to Mickey?

885
01:11:47,469 --> 01:11:49,595
Maybe a wee bit.

886
01:11:49,763 --> 01:11:51,973
Well, thank you for doing that.

887
01:11:52,141 --> 01:11:55,226
It wasn't my decision.
It was his choice.

888
01:11:55,352 --> 01:11:57,687
Well, thank you if you did.

889
01:12:00,316 --> 01:12:04,485
This is just mad. I've never even been
out of Ireland before, and now all this.

890
01:12:04,695 --> 01:12:06,863
- I know. I can tell.
- Oh, you can tell?

891
01:12:07,031 --> 01:12:09,824
Mm-hm. It's cute.

892
01:12:10,034 --> 01:12:11,868
Oh, great. Now I'm cute.

893
01:12:12,077 --> 01:12:16,706
Don't be so sensitive.
Cute can be, um, a very good thing.

894
01:12:18,375 --> 01:12:20,543
Well, then, I'm sensitive.

895
01:12:21,712 --> 01:12:23,588
And cute.

896
01:12:34,683 --> 01:12:37,518
Look, Grace, I'm sorry.
I just can't do that.

897
01:12:54,745 --> 01:12:56,829
You turned her down, didn't you?

898
01:12:58,791 --> 01:13:00,875
Mickey's good boy.

899
01:13:06,882 --> 01:13:08,925
Sainthood.

900
01:13:10,094 --> 01:13:12,136
Is that what you're going for?

901
01:13:25,901 --> 01:13:28,236
- It's gonna be a fine trip.
- Sean!

902
01:13:28,404 --> 01:13:32,156
Are you coming to Scotland or what?
Come on, man.

903
01:13:40,666 --> 01:13:45,420
I'm hearing whispers MI5 are
gonna step in and poach your star boy.

904
01:13:48,173 --> 01:13:51,717
He's a damn fine bargaining chip.
You could jump a few rungs.

905
01:13:51,885 --> 01:13:54,846
Do you know
what the word "collusion" means?

906
01:13:55,013 --> 01:13:57,223
It does have
a certain romantic ring to it,

907
01:13:57,391 --> 01:13:59,684
but as words go,
it's extremely overrated.

908
01:13:59,852 --> 01:14:02,603
We do the dirty work
while those brave souls in London...

909
01:14:02,813 --> 01:14:04,897
...fight a battle
from their drawing rooms.

910
01:14:05,023 --> 01:14:09,193
I'm telling you, I like it
here. It's peaceful. It's nice.

911
01:14:10,404 --> 01:14:14,323
Look around, right? There's not one
chopper overhead, nothing. It's nice.

912
01:14:14,450 --> 01:14:18,161
I guess you're nesting.
Come on. We're late.

913
01:14:18,328 --> 01:14:20,455
You're not going in
on your own.

914
01:14:20,664 --> 01:14:22,582
I'll do what I need to do.

915
01:14:28,213 --> 01:14:31,841
Grace, good to see you.
Apologies about the cold boys, eh?

916
01:14:31,967 --> 01:14:34,677
That why you're wearing
that naffjumper?

917
01:14:34,845 --> 01:14:36,387
What the fuck is wrong with you?

918
01:14:36,555 --> 01:14:38,556
Bastard.

919
01:14:40,851 --> 01:14:44,729
- I told you no guns.
- Are we going to do this deal?

920
01:14:46,857 --> 01:14:50,109
Grace, you're not going in
on your own, OK?

921
01:15:02,581 --> 01:15:04,665
For fuck's sake.

922
01:15:06,585 --> 01:15:09,670
I'll be looking into you.
You can count on it.

923
01:15:10,547 --> 01:15:15,176
Lara?

924
01:15:31,527 --> 01:15:34,487
- Is she here?
- Three days and nights you disappear.

925
01:15:34,613 --> 01:15:36,864
I know. Can I just speak to her,
Mrs Flaherty?

926
01:15:37,032 --> 01:15:39,867
- Shame on you!
- I just need to speak to her.

927
01:15:40,035 --> 01:15:43,579
Lara! Lara, are you in there?
Please, I was snagged by the RUC!

928
01:15:43,747 --> 01:15:47,083
- That's a good one.
- They wouldn't let me near a telephone!

929
01:15:47,251 --> 01:15:51,337
I swear, they wouldn't let me near a
telephone! There was nothing I could do!

930
01:15:51,505 --> 01:15:54,715
If I could have spoken to you, I would!
Come on, please!

931
01:15:54,883 --> 01:15:59,679
Will you just come to the window, Lara?
Please, I just wanna see your face!

932
01:15:59,846 --> 01:16:01,639
Fuck!

933
01:16:01,848 --> 01:16:03,933
Lara, please.

934
01:16:08,564 --> 01:16:11,399
I'm so sorry. Lara, I'm sorry.

935
01:16:14,361 --> 01:16:15,444
I'm sorry.

936
01:16:17,948 --> 01:16:20,491
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

937
01:16:22,494 --> 01:16:25,121
I'm sorry.

938
01:16:25,289 --> 01:16:28,958
I love you, OK? Look, look, I love you.

939
01:16:30,627 --> 01:16:34,797
Look at me, please. Look at me, please.
Lara, look at me, please.

940
01:16:34,965 --> 01:16:39,927
I love you. I do.
Do you love me? Do you love me?

941
01:16:41,680 --> 01:16:44,682
- I thought you were dead!
- I'm so sorry.

942
01:16:47,102 --> 01:16:49,228
I'm so sorry.

943
01:17:06,038 --> 01:17:08,122
That's it, eh? Come here.

944
01:17:11,168 --> 01:17:14,962
I'm taking you to Scotland. That's it.
I'm just gonna take you and leave.

945
01:17:15,130 --> 01:17:18,758
We're gonna get away
from all this political shit.

946
01:17:18,884 --> 01:17:22,928
- You're never gonna leave the IRA.
- Oh, no?

947
01:17:23,055 --> 01:17:26,140
I'll do whatever you want me to do
at this point. I'm yours.

948
01:17:26,350 --> 01:17:30,895
Because you're captured by the anarchy
of it all, like the rest of them.

949
01:17:31,021 --> 01:17:33,147
And you love it.

950
01:17:35,484 --> 01:17:38,569
We're gonna hit the pub
afterwards, courtesy of Libya.

951
01:17:38,779 --> 01:17:41,113
Don't go AWOL again.
It's not healthy.

952
01:17:41,323 --> 01:17:44,867
I am in charge
of this entire operation.

953
01:17:45,035 --> 01:17:48,621
Anyway, I've got to get back. Lara's not
exactly buying my excuses anymore.

954
01:17:48,789 --> 01:17:54,251
Yeah, I was married to a nice girl until
I tried the alien abduction excuse.

955
01:17:54,419 --> 01:17:56,921
Is this the
"take care of your family" speech?

956
01:17:57,047 --> 01:17:59,757
You're so young, Martin,
you make me envious.

957
01:17:59,966 --> 01:18:03,260
Life's full of mistakes. I lost
my family making all the obvious ones.

958
01:18:05,013 --> 01:18:07,056
There, that was your speech.

959
01:18:07,265 --> 01:18:09,809
Aye, very moving.

960
01:18:09,976 --> 01:18:12,687
Are you saying that I should quit?
Is that it?

961
01:18:12,854 --> 01:18:15,106
- We've had a good run.
- Aye, yeah, we have.

962
01:18:17,150 --> 01:18:21,195
Look, there's gonna be a drop.
It's on Thursday night, on the docks.

963
01:18:21,405 --> 01:18:25,408
My mate's wee brother's gonna
be there. He doesn't know anything.

964
01:18:25,575 --> 01:18:28,285
He's just gonna be there,
so leave him alone.

965
01:18:28,495 --> 01:18:31,122
Go in, get the guns and then get out.

966
01:18:32,708 --> 01:18:36,293
OK, this is it.
What the fuck's going on?

967
01:18:36,461 --> 01:18:38,587
Down on the ground!

968
01:18:38,755 --> 01:18:43,300
What's going on?
Ah, Jesus Christ. Marty, they're Brits.

969
01:18:47,806 --> 01:18:51,475
Get it started, Marty.
Get the fuck out of here. Come on.

970
01:18:51,601 --> 01:18:54,478
What the fuck was that all about?

971
01:19:04,489 --> 01:19:08,367
You said I'd save lives, and that
includes my people, you Brit bastard!

972
01:19:08,535 --> 01:19:12,621
It's a set-up for a bigger fish. It was
out of my hands. It's big boys' rules.

973
01:19:12,748 --> 01:19:15,875
Is that it? You're gonna hide
behind big boys' rules?

974
01:19:16,042 --> 01:19:19,837
OK, well, how about this?
"Yes, sir! Consider it done, sir!"

975
01:19:20,005 --> 01:19:24,091
"He's just another statistic, sir!
It didn't even happen, sir!"

976
01:19:24,259 --> 01:19:29,054
Right? You think that shit's gonna
change the fact that you, yeah, you,

977
01:19:29,222 --> 01:19:33,017
you killed an 18-year-old fella
that didn't know any better?

978
01:19:34,728 --> 01:19:36,645
And you're innocent?

979
01:19:36,855 --> 01:19:41,484
You and your mates are volunteers
in a volunteer organisation.

980
01:19:41,651 --> 01:19:43,986
Who's making you do anything
you don't want to do?

981
01:19:44,154 --> 01:19:46,071
Where does that leave you
and your mates?

982
01:19:47,365 --> 01:19:52,161
Aye. Aye, my mates. That's exactly
what they are, they're my mates.

983
01:19:52,329 --> 01:19:55,790
I know his ma. Do you understand that?
Is that getting through?

984
01:19:55,999 --> 01:19:59,543
I know this guy's ma
and I know his brothers!

985
01:19:59,753 --> 01:20:03,631
I told yous what I know
so you could save his arse, huh?

986
01:20:03,799 --> 01:20:07,635
But, no, he's just another Paddy to you
and your big boys, isn't he?

987
01:20:07,761 --> 01:20:10,763
You know what?
Get the fuck out of my country.

988
01:20:19,397 --> 01:20:24,860
We all know the IRA aren't terrorists.
The IRA are freedom fighters.

989
01:20:28,824 --> 01:20:33,954
Rise up for our help, oh, Lord!
strike down our enemies before us.

990
01:20:36,498 --> 01:20:39,959
An eyewitness maintains
one of the men pleaded for his life...

991
01:20:40,126 --> 01:20:41,961
...before he was shot.

992
01:20:42,170 --> 01:20:44,588
This brings to eight
the number of IRA members...

993
01:20:44,756 --> 01:20:47,716
...who have been killed
in the last three months.

994
01:20:59,437 --> 01:21:03,691
Right, stop here. Remember,
lads, single shots to head and the body.

995
01:21:03,859 --> 01:21:06,569
No fucking meddling, OK? Away yous go.

996
01:21:14,411 --> 01:21:16,871
- Well, how's the kid?
- He's growing.

997
01:21:17,831 --> 01:21:19,915
- They tend to do that.
- Yeah.

998
01:21:29,467 --> 01:21:31,385
- Fuck it!
- Well?

999
01:21:31,595 --> 01:21:34,388
- The fucker wouldn't go down.
- Drive.

1000
01:21:34,556 --> 01:21:37,349
- This wee girl was watching.
- Uh-huh?

1001
01:21:37,559 --> 01:21:40,561
We were wearing the balaclavas.
She wouldn't make us.

1002
01:21:40,729 --> 01:21:43,772
Right, here, get them shirts off.

1003
01:21:43,982 --> 01:21:47,610
I want you to take the car
up to Hightown Road. Burn it, OK?

1004
01:21:47,777 --> 01:21:52,239
- Did we actually get what we came for?
- Saturday 28th of March.

1005
01:21:52,407 --> 01:21:54,909
At least something went fucking right.

1006
01:22:17,140 --> 01:22:19,892
I've, uh, not really been sleeping.

1007
01:22:21,061 --> 01:22:23,812
That's why God invented sleeping pills.

1008
01:22:23,980 --> 01:22:26,023
I take it you've reconsidered.

1009
01:22:27,859 --> 01:22:30,819
- The hit on Park Street was...
- Ray.

1010
01:22:30,946 --> 01:22:33,906
Aye, and Johnny.

1011
01:22:34,074 --> 01:22:38,077
Oh, and a wee girl
saw the whole fucking thing.

1012
01:22:38,244 --> 01:22:42,039
Yeah. Seven years old.
She was right next to her daddy.

1013
01:22:42,165 --> 01:22:44,166
Got covered in his blood, I'm told.

1014
01:22:44,334 --> 01:22:45,834
I've got a son,

1015
01:22:46,044 --> 01:22:50,130
and there's nobody deserves to grow up
with that picture in their mind.

1016
01:22:51,967 --> 01:22:53,968
They didn't give me any warning.

1017
01:22:54,177 --> 01:22:57,680
I'm starting to, you know,
think that they're onto me.

1018
01:22:58,598 --> 01:23:00,933
You wouldn't be here
if they were onto you.

1019
01:23:01,059 --> 01:23:04,269
I've not got a good feeling about it.

1020
01:23:04,396 --> 01:23:07,356
- My car's definitely marked, right?
- Yeah, of course.

1021
01:23:07,524 --> 01:23:10,484
Go home. Hug your wife and baby.

1022
01:23:16,574 --> 01:23:19,284
The pub job's going on the 28th.

1023
01:23:20,787 --> 01:23:22,871
That's... That's all I've got.

1024
01:23:24,833 --> 01:23:26,917
Well, you did well.

1025
01:23:30,797 --> 01:23:32,673
Aye.

1026
01:23:40,640 --> 01:23:45,853
Make sure you check the timer. That way
it doesn't blow up in your face.

1027
01:23:46,021 --> 01:23:49,440
It's gonna blow up
the whole city, man.

1028
01:23:49,607 --> 01:23:53,235
It seems like whenever you're around,
nothing blows up.

1029
01:23:59,951 --> 01:24:04,121
- You wanna shut the door for me?
- Yeah, you give it a good kick. Good man.

1030
01:24:04,289 --> 01:24:08,876
There you go. What did we get Mummy?
We got her fish and chips, didn't we?

1031
01:24:09,044 --> 01:24:12,671
Straight out the deep fat fryer
we caught this, me and Patrick.

1032
01:24:12,797 --> 01:24:14,923
All right, let's get some food.

1033
01:24:15,967 --> 01:24:20,304
Your friends
Mickey and Grace dropped by.

1034
01:24:22,182 --> 01:24:27,269
Oh, they went on about the new house,
the fridge, the cooker.

1035
01:24:27,437 --> 01:24:30,856
They were extremely interested
in the new TV.

1036
01:24:31,066 --> 01:24:35,360
It's... It's fine, honestly.
It's nothing. They trust me. It's fine.

1037
01:24:35,528 --> 01:24:40,074
We have a child, Martin.
For his sake, I'd leave.

1038
01:24:40,283 --> 01:24:42,284
But I'm pregnant.

1039
01:24:43,953 --> 01:24:46,080
Where am I gonna go?

1040
01:24:48,041 --> 01:24:50,918
Look, let's get married.
I wanna get married. Do you?

1041
01:24:51,086 --> 01:24:53,420
- Let's get married, please. Come on.
- Why?

1042
01:24:53,588 --> 01:24:57,299
What do you mean, why?
Because I love you, that's why.

1043
01:24:58,468 --> 01:25:00,385
- Love?
- Aye.

1044
01:25:00,553 --> 01:25:04,515
Every time you leave, I wonder if
it's the last time I'll see you alive.

1045
01:25:04,641 --> 01:25:07,434
I have nightmares!
The neighbours are afraid of you.

1046
01:25:07,560 --> 01:25:09,103
You wear that like a medal.

1047
01:25:09,312 --> 01:25:11,939
I heard you were palling
with the RA nuthers!

1048
01:25:12,107 --> 01:25:14,650
Are you?! Are you?!

1049
01:25:15,860 --> 01:25:19,655
What exactly does the daddy
of our wee boy do for the cause?

1050
01:25:42,387 --> 01:25:45,055
Marty, see you
for a couple minutes, son?

1051
01:25:45,265 --> 01:25:48,475
- Mickey.
- Marty'll debrief you later.

1052
01:25:57,360 --> 01:26:00,028
Looks like we're all set.

1053
01:26:00,196 --> 01:26:03,365
Here's a present. It's from Mickey.

1054
01:26:03,533 --> 01:26:07,286
He wants you to keep it close by.
You know how he worries.

1055
01:26:07,453 --> 01:26:10,914
Aye. This is gonna make you famous.

1056
01:26:11,875 --> 01:26:16,795
By the way, it's only me and you
know the exact location.

1057
01:26:17,005 --> 01:26:18,881
Aye.

1058
01:26:46,075 --> 01:26:48,452
Info finally confirmed.

1059
01:26:48,620 --> 01:26:52,331
Every Saturday, the prison wardens
play a football match.

1060
01:26:52,457 --> 01:26:54,625
Locations are kept top secret.

1061
01:26:56,169 --> 01:26:59,713
Now, next Saturday, March 28th,
after the semis,

1062
01:26:59,881 --> 01:27:02,216
they'll be drinking in the Whale pub.

1063
01:27:02,425 --> 01:27:03,800
So we have a week.

1064
01:27:03,968 --> 01:27:07,221
This is the big one.
Did you give her the gun?

1065
01:27:07,347 --> 01:27:10,390
Yes.
Look, tonight we do a test run.

1066
01:27:10,516 --> 01:27:13,644
We check the place out,
we finalise details. No weapons.

1067
01:27:13,811 --> 01:27:17,314
If anything happens, they will know
that it was me who told.

1068
01:27:17,440 --> 01:27:21,109
Go on the recce. We won't
do anything till next saturday.

1069
01:27:21,319 --> 01:27:25,614
That's when we grab them, armed and
loaded, and when all the shit goes down,

1070
01:27:25,782 --> 01:27:28,742
you walk into
one of our secured vehicles.

1071
01:27:28,952 --> 01:27:31,411
We'll pull your family out.

1072
01:27:31,579 --> 01:27:34,498
Don't tell Lara anything.
A slip could be costly.

1073
01:27:37,585 --> 01:27:39,628
She's pregnant again.

1074
01:27:43,007 --> 01:27:47,386
Congratulations. I won't let
anything happen to you or your family.

1075
01:27:52,558 --> 01:27:56,228
- MI5 just called me.
- You told them to fuck off.

1076
01:27:56,437 --> 01:27:58,647
It's done.

1077
01:28:00,149 --> 01:28:02,901
- The pub job?
- They're running it now.

1078
01:28:04,988 --> 01:28:07,072
What about my source?

1079
01:28:08,157 --> 01:28:13,662
A good handler manages the source.
He doesn't let the source manage him.

1080
01:28:13,788 --> 01:28:15,914
He's not your source anymore.

1081
01:28:19,127 --> 01:28:22,796
It's shit like this that ends careers,
so walk away.

1082
01:28:32,515 --> 01:28:34,933
Right, lads, for security purposes,

1083
01:28:35,059 --> 01:28:39,730
most of you are hearing this
for the first time, so pay attention.

1084
01:28:39,856 --> 01:28:42,691
It's your lives that's at risk here, OK?

1085
01:28:43,651 --> 01:28:45,819
Martin, it's all yours.

1086
01:28:45,945 --> 01:28:51,033
We'll have two AKs in the getaway car.
Escape routes are on your maps.

1087
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:54,911
- How many rounds we got?
- About 189.

1088
01:28:55,121 --> 01:28:58,290
Two mags for each of the AKs.
Spares are in the getaway car.

1089
01:28:58,458 --> 01:29:01,043
- Why, do you think that's enough?
- Aye.

1090
01:29:01,210 --> 01:29:04,338
Tonight is a dry run.
We make sure our plan is good to go.

1091
01:29:04,547 --> 01:29:07,007
Next saturday, on the 28th,
it's for real.

1092
01:29:07,133 --> 01:29:08,967
...sean, Kieren, go in the side door.

1093
01:29:09,135 --> 01:29:12,346
Grace, we'll go in the front.
Check all exits.

1094
01:29:12,513 --> 01:29:13,847
A wee bottle of Guinness.

1095
01:29:14,057 --> 01:29:18,810
Johnny, stay with the car.
I'll go inside, watch the front door.

1096
01:29:18,978 --> 01:29:24,316
Get a drink, do what you've got to do,
but don't leave any fingerprints.

1097
01:29:24,484 --> 01:29:26,360
Keep the change.

1098
01:30:09,612 --> 01:30:14,408
Hey. Ease up, man. For fuck's sake.

1099
01:30:21,207 --> 01:30:22,999
You got the time?

1100
01:30:25,420 --> 01:30:27,629
Code green. Code green.

1101
01:30:40,726 --> 01:30:44,187
Shit! You're a dead man!
You're a dead man!

1102
01:30:44,981 --> 01:30:47,607
You fucking bastard, you!

1103
01:30:48,985 --> 01:30:50,777
You're a fucking tout!

1104
01:30:51,863 --> 01:30:53,864
Fucking bastard! I'm gonna kill you!

1105
01:31:00,455 --> 01:31:02,539
We've got you now, bitch!

1106
01:31:18,347 --> 01:31:20,348
Hello?

1107
01:31:20,475 --> 01:31:23,935
- Lara, Lara, it's me.
- Oh, God. Martin!

1108
01:31:24,145 --> 01:31:26,021
Listen to me. Listen to me, OK?

1109
01:31:26,189 --> 01:31:30,150
I need you to kiss Patrick
good night for me, OK?

1110
01:31:33,988 --> 01:31:35,697
We're gonna be all right.

1111
01:31:35,865 --> 01:31:37,949
I'm gonna go to my mummy's.

1112
01:31:39,452 --> 01:31:42,120
I'm so sorry.

1113
01:31:42,288 --> 01:31:43,330
Martin?

1114
01:31:43,456 --> 01:31:47,334
- Aye.
- I got a question for you.

1115
01:31:47,502 --> 01:31:49,544
What's that?

1116
01:31:51,380 --> 01:31:54,799
- Will you marry me?
- Aye.

1117
01:31:54,967 --> 01:31:57,052
- You promise?
- Aye.

1118
01:31:57,220 --> 01:32:00,722
- Are we married?
- Yeah, we're married.

1119
01:32:03,726 --> 01:32:05,894
Great.

1120
01:32:06,020 --> 01:32:08,146
We are man and wife.

1121
01:32:09,732 --> 01:32:11,775
I love you.

1122
01:32:14,278 --> 01:32:19,533
I love you, too. I love you, and I love
Patrick, OK? But you've got to get out.

1123
01:32:19,742 --> 01:32:22,160
What's that?

1124
01:32:38,553 --> 01:32:41,054
- So where is he?
- How the fuck do I know?

1125
01:32:41,222 --> 01:32:43,765
Under the circumstances,
it's a fair question.

1126
01:32:43,891 --> 01:32:47,936
- Did you compromise the operation?
- So that's how this is gonna go down.

1127
01:32:48,145 --> 01:32:51,982
MI5 step in, screw up
and I get to eat the bullshit.

1128
01:32:53,609 --> 01:32:55,735
It's a big picture thing.

1129
01:32:58,239 --> 01:33:00,782
It was supposed to be
an easy bait and switch.

1130
01:33:00,950 --> 01:33:05,704
Your boy shouldn't have walked, but he
did and now there's a mess to clean up.

1131
01:33:07,164 --> 01:33:10,959
Don't be forgetting,
you're one of the good guys.

1132
01:33:13,838 --> 01:33:16,923
- A man of the law.
- Since when?

1133
01:33:17,091 --> 01:33:19,843
Since when did this become
about the law?

1134
01:33:58,716 --> 01:34:01,259
What the hell happened to you?

1135
01:34:01,469 --> 01:34:03,762
Me and Lara had a fight.

1136
01:34:03,929 --> 01:34:06,306
Marty...

1137
01:34:09,393 --> 01:34:12,020
Ma, no.

1138
01:34:12,146 --> 01:34:14,481
- Hello?
- Hello. Is Martin there?

1139
01:34:14,649 --> 01:34:17,108
- No, I haven't seen him.
- Tell him it's Fergus.

1140
01:34:17,234 --> 01:34:19,527
- Fergus?
- Give me the phone.

1141
01:34:19,695 --> 01:34:22,030
You set me up, man, you lying bastard!

1142
01:34:22,156 --> 01:34:25,992
It had nothing to do with me. I'll be
there in 20. I'm your only chance now.

1143
01:34:28,537 --> 01:34:30,413
Marty, what's going on?

1144
01:34:30,581 --> 01:34:31,915
- It's fine, Ma.
- Tell me.

1145
01:34:32,083 --> 01:34:34,417
Listen, it's all right.

1146
01:34:37,713 --> 01:34:42,842
- He's a tout, Mrs McGartland.
- There's no way that's true.

1147
01:34:43,052 --> 01:34:44,511
Marty.

1148
01:34:49,934 --> 01:34:53,478
Special Branch don't want him anymore.

1149
01:34:53,646 --> 01:34:56,356
- Connie!
- Connie, no!

1150
01:34:56,482 --> 01:34:59,067
No! No!

1151
01:34:59,193 --> 01:35:02,696
I'm going with you, OK.
You leave my family, please.

1152
01:35:03,698 --> 01:35:08,576
Ma. Ma, listen to me. I'll be fine. I'll
be back in two hours, OK? Two hours.

1153
01:35:08,703 --> 01:35:11,996
Let go of me! Get off of me!

1154
01:35:12,164 --> 01:35:15,083
Get off him! Get off him!

1155
01:35:15,209 --> 01:35:18,086
- Oh, Ma.
- Are you all right?

1156
01:35:19,422 --> 01:35:22,382
Christ. Christ. Oh, Christ!

1157
01:35:31,600 --> 01:35:34,102
Yeah.

1158
01:35:34,311 --> 01:35:38,773
Jesus. Fine. We're not going anywhere.
Just getting a bath.

1159
01:35:42,737 --> 01:35:44,738
They won't be here for another hour.

1160
01:35:53,956 --> 01:35:58,293
If it was up to me, you wouldn't be
seeing the end of that hour.

1161
01:36:03,674 --> 01:36:07,385
Piece of shit. Come on.

1162
01:36:15,436 --> 01:36:16,770
Oh, shit.

1163
01:36:16,937 --> 01:36:19,022
Ow! Fuck!

1164
01:36:21,776 --> 01:36:23,818
Where's Martin, then?

1165
01:36:25,654 --> 01:36:29,908
- You gonna let them kill your mate?
- He's not my mate.

1166
01:36:30,034 --> 01:36:35,455
Ever wonder why you're not behind bars?
We've been all over you for two years.

1167
01:36:35,623 --> 01:36:37,665
Your mate, Martin.

1168
01:36:42,004 --> 01:36:44,923
I hear that Special Branch
have lost interest in you.

1169
01:36:45,132 --> 01:36:50,470
Well, then, that makes me unofficial.
New rules. You get to live if he lives.

1170
01:36:55,184 --> 01:36:57,227
Broom Park.

1171
01:36:57,436 --> 01:36:59,604
Broom Park, you fucking bastard!

1172
01:37:16,956 --> 01:37:20,041
Yeah, this is a message
from John smith, IRA.

1173
01:37:20,251 --> 01:37:24,045
There's a bomb. A lot of samaritans
will die. Broom Park.

1174
01:37:24,171 --> 01:37:27,090
- Give us the password.
- Carry Gold.

1175
01:37:31,220 --> 01:37:34,389
Wait up. We need to be able
to question him. Bring him in here.

1176
01:37:34,557 --> 01:37:36,474
Come on.

1177
01:37:37,726 --> 01:37:39,602
Over there.

1178
01:37:55,494 --> 01:37:58,371
Fucking peelers like flies around shit.

1179
01:38:05,045 --> 01:38:06,754
You gonna tell me what you did?

1180
01:38:29,695 --> 01:38:32,488
I'm pretty sure the IRA
is holding my top boy in there.

1181
01:38:32,698 --> 01:38:36,534
Funny that we're looking for a bomb
in the same place your source is.

1182
01:38:36,744 --> 01:38:38,620
- Thomas...
- Great delay tactic.

1183
01:38:38,787 --> 01:38:40,872
Pretty much locked the place down.

1184
01:38:41,040 --> 01:38:44,208
- Move out!
- Who are you taking orders from?

1185
01:38:44,376 --> 01:38:47,879
- Just trying to make it to retirement.
- Oh, fuck it, then. Fuck it.

1186
01:38:48,047 --> 01:38:49,756
Some stunt.

1187
01:38:49,924 --> 01:38:51,799
Move out!

1188
01:39:02,311 --> 01:39:04,145
Aw, fuck, come on!

1189
01:39:16,951 --> 01:39:19,577
You're gonna talk, Marty. You know that.

1190
01:39:20,913 --> 01:39:22,580
You know that.

1191
01:39:27,336 --> 01:39:30,129
Keep it shut, big man, right?

1192
01:39:30,255 --> 01:39:32,173
Get it.

1193
01:39:37,346 --> 01:39:39,222
What are you doing here?

1194
01:39:39,390 --> 01:39:42,141
He was my mate.
I wanna hear him fucking say it!

1195
01:39:42,309 --> 01:39:44,852
- Sean, you're not authorised...
- Say it!

1196
01:39:44,979 --> 01:39:50,108
Get out, Sean! This is an army order.
I'm your senior officer. Get out!

1197
01:39:50,275 --> 01:39:51,985
Sean, are you deaf? Get out!

1198
01:39:52,152 --> 01:39:55,196
You'll bring the peelers
to the fucking door!

1199
01:39:55,364 --> 01:39:58,491
Shut up!
I wanna fucking hear him say it!

1200
01:40:10,713 --> 01:40:12,797
Get an ambulance, now!

1201
01:40:21,223 --> 01:40:24,559
He's a peeler.
We've no orders for this.

1202
01:40:36,030 --> 01:40:38,114
Jesus Christ.

1203
01:40:40,117 --> 01:40:42,243
OK, what happened?

1204
01:40:48,667 --> 01:40:50,752
Get him back.

1205
01:41:12,733 --> 01:41:14,901
- Take him to City Hospital!
- The Royal's closer.

1206
01:41:15,069 --> 01:41:18,905
He won't live if we take him there.
Take him to the City.

1207
01:41:20,074 --> 01:41:22,575
Get alongside him. Get alongside him!

1208
01:41:40,969 --> 01:41:43,805
Right up Jackson Street! Jackson Street!

1209
01:41:54,358 --> 01:41:56,484
Keep going and ram him.

1210
01:42:14,461 --> 01:42:15,753
Fuck it.

1211
01:42:23,554 --> 01:42:25,847
Shit! Shit!

1212
01:42:29,434 --> 01:42:31,269
Watch the door!

1213
01:42:37,818 --> 01:42:40,570
I hear the shit's going down
at Special Branch.

1214
01:42:40,737 --> 01:42:44,282
Bloody hell.
What is the matter with you?

1215
01:42:44,491 --> 01:42:49,203
Why is the kid still breathing?
Was it not a simple request?

1216
01:42:49,371 --> 01:42:51,789
- If it was, you'd have done it.
- Fuck off.

1217
01:42:51,957 --> 01:42:53,666
You asked.

1218
01:42:53,834 --> 01:42:55,877
Yeah, well, clean it up.

1219
01:43:07,055 --> 01:43:11,392
If the RUC don't protect him, MI5 will
leave him exposed, a gift to the IRA,

1220
01:43:11,560 --> 01:43:14,854
a bait and switch to deflect attention
from a plant higher up.

1221
01:43:15,022 --> 01:43:18,316
- What's your stake in this?
- He was my operative.

1222
01:43:18,483 --> 01:43:20,568
Shit.

1223
01:43:20,736 --> 01:43:22,904
There's no way
I can get involved in this.

1224
01:43:23,071 --> 01:43:26,282
How about I go to the press
and we debate this in public?

1225
01:43:26,450 --> 01:43:30,244
- You won't live long enough.
- Martin.

1226
01:43:30,412 --> 01:43:32,538
That's his name. Martin.

1227
01:43:35,083 --> 01:43:39,587
He saved, I'd guess, 50 soldiers,
RUC officers, prison wardens.

1228
01:43:39,713 --> 01:43:41,797
MI5 turns him into a bargaining chip.

1229
01:43:41,965 --> 01:43:45,218
He has a girlfriend, a son
and another baby on the way.

1230
01:43:48,513 --> 01:43:52,934
Look, we uphold the law and break
the law in the name of the law.

1231
01:43:53,101 --> 01:43:54,560
Is that why you signed up?

1232
01:43:54,728 --> 01:43:57,730
Not a bloody day goes by
when I don't serve this community.

1233
01:43:57,940 --> 01:43:59,732
I know.

1234
01:43:59,942 --> 01:44:01,692
Shit.

1235
01:44:01,902 --> 01:44:03,736
Why me?

1236
01:44:42,150 --> 01:44:44,819
You f...

1237
01:44:45,028 --> 01:44:46,862
You fuck...

1238
01:44:53,161 --> 01:44:56,497
- Where's Lara and the boy?
- They're at her mum's.

1239
01:45:00,669 --> 01:45:03,296
How long have I been... been out?

1240
01:45:04,423 --> 01:45:07,133
Long enough for the dust to settle.

1241
01:45:11,263 --> 01:45:13,639
You deserted me.

1242
01:45:15,767 --> 01:45:18,894
Well, like it or not,
I'm your only friend right now.

1243
01:45:21,815 --> 01:45:23,691
My real name's Dean.

1244
01:45:25,027 --> 01:45:28,529
But you can keep calling me Fergus.
The name's grown on me.

1245
01:45:31,450 --> 01:45:33,534
Is he OK?

1246
01:45:35,704 --> 01:45:37,788
He's OK, yeah.

1247
01:45:41,752 --> 01:45:44,837
- His wife's here to see him.
- He hasn't got a wife.

1248
01:45:45,047 --> 01:45:48,007
- Where's the RUC officer?
- I don't know where he is.

1249
01:45:48,175 --> 01:45:50,343
Did you tell her what room he's in?

1250
01:45:54,556 --> 01:45:58,059
- This is against my orders.
- He won't last the night here.

1251
01:45:58,226 --> 01:46:01,479
He has a deep internal cut,
a fractured jaw, severe concussion...

1252
01:46:01,688 --> 01:46:03,105
...and several broken ribs.

1253
01:46:03,315 --> 01:46:06,108
Just pray
this is a nine-lives situation.

1254
01:46:40,727 --> 01:46:44,897
- This is pretty cosy for a safe house.
- It's my house.

1255
01:46:58,912 --> 01:47:03,791
So, Dean... I hope you have a plan.

1256
01:47:04,751 --> 01:47:08,212
Well, Lara still doesn't know
you're alive.

1257
01:47:08,422 --> 01:47:11,257
I've negotiated a deal
with Scotland Yard.

1258
01:47:17,139 --> 01:47:21,809
Call Lara. See if she'll like the idea
of getting married in Scotland.

1259
01:47:26,523 --> 01:47:29,942
You look me in the eye, OK,

1260
01:47:30,152 --> 01:47:33,612
you tell me what kind of life
you think she'd have.

1261
01:47:33,822 --> 01:47:36,490
No hope, no friends, no community.

1262
01:47:36,658 --> 01:47:40,995
Always looking over our shoulder,
scared to death for them kids.

1263
01:47:42,831 --> 01:47:44,915
I can't do it.

1264
01:47:46,293 --> 01:47:48,752
I really can't do it. I won't do it.

1265
01:48:02,058 --> 01:48:04,185
I thought I was saving lives.

1266
01:48:05,854 --> 01:48:07,938
A superhero.

1267
01:48:33,381 --> 01:48:36,717
- Do you ever see your kid?
- He's, uh...

1268
01:48:36,885 --> 01:48:39,553
He's got a lot going on right now.

1269
01:48:39,721 --> 01:48:42,806
# And then my son

1270
01:48:43,016 --> 01:48:45,476
# He walked away

1271
01:48:45,602 --> 01:48:48,395
# I bowed my head

1272
01:48:48,522 --> 01:48:51,357
# In tearful shame

1273
01:48:52,067 --> 01:48:57,363
# son, you'll come to know

1274
01:48:57,531 --> 01:49:01,659
# Your sad smile is my blame

1275
01:49:01,826 --> 01:49:03,369
OK, let's go.

1276
01:49:03,537 --> 01:49:05,913
# It's the hero

1277
01:49:06,039 --> 01:49:09,250
# Puts down the gun

1278
01:49:09,417 --> 01:49:14,755
# In the name of daughters and our sons

1279
01:49:14,923 --> 01:49:17,633
# And now I pray

1280
01:49:17,801 --> 01:49:20,636
# Our war is done

1281
01:49:20,804 --> 01:49:23,681
# The dove flies free

1282
01:49:23,848 --> 01:49:26,642
# And we have won...

1283
01:49:26,810 --> 01:49:30,271
Oh, my God.

1284
01:49:30,438 --> 01:49:33,649
Help! Call an ambulance!

1285
01:49:35,944 --> 01:49:39,446
Stay awake.
Help is coming. Do you have family?

1286
01:49:39,573 --> 01:49:42,366
Who should I call?

1287
01:49:42,534 --> 01:49:45,953
Dean. Dean McTear. Dean McTear.

1288
01:49:46,079 --> 01:49:48,205
He's family?

1289
01:49:48,331 --> 01:49:51,667
Yeah. Dean McTear.

1290
01:49:51,835 --> 01:49:54,545
# We have won

1291
01:49:58,758 --> 01:50:03,304
# My son cried and said to me

1292
01:50:04,431 --> 01:50:09,852
# Why do young men kill what they love?

1293
01:50:11,104 --> 01:50:14,815
# The coward with a kiss

1294
01:50:16,860 --> 01:50:21,614
# The brave man with his sword

1295
01:50:22,490 --> 01:50:27,244
# Blood flows dripping from the dove

1296
01:50:27,954 --> 01:50:32,001
# You say it's for your daughters
and for your sons

1297
01:50:34,169 --> 01:50:38,672
# Father, it's time your war is done

1298
01:50:40,008 --> 01:50:42,343
# We'll be free

1299
01:50:42,510 --> 01:50:45,721
# We will have won

1300
01:50:48,350 --> 01:50:53,979
# Who in our hearts do we pray for?

1301
01:50:54,147 --> 01:50:59,401
# Who do we hold so very near?

1302
01:51:00,445 --> 01:51:03,530
# A cry from a lover

1303
01:51:06,451 --> 01:51:12,039
# A child's silent tear

1304
01:51:12,207 --> 01:51:17,337
# The might of God was on each side

1305
01:51:18,546 --> 01:51:23,801
# But nothing came of nothing
and war was my bride

1306
01:51:23,968 --> 01:51:26,929
# I heard of heroes

1307
01:51:27,097 --> 01:51:29,390
# Dreamed I'd be the same

1308
01:51:29,557 --> 01:51:32,101
# I'd even the score

1309
01:51:32,268 --> 01:51:35,562
