00:00:03,408 --> 00:00:07,504
That company guy, Matusek,
cleared me this morning.

2
00:00:07,579 --> 00:00:09,672
This will do everything
but cook breakfast.

3
00:00:09,748 --> 00:00:12,012
H23.

4
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:18,583
The house is here. She's there!

5
00:00:18,657 --> 00:00:20,579
How did the computer know she's there?

6
00:00:20,659 --> 00:00:25,551
The people clear it with their
security patrol and they zap it to us.

7
00:00:30,735 --> 00:00:34,091
Oh! Let the good times roll!

8
00:00:40,779 --> 00:00:44,237
<i>No.! No, not yet.! Not yet.</i>

9
00:00:44,316 --> 00:00:46,409
<i>No.! I'm not ready.!</i>

10
00:00:51,523 --> 00:00:53,445
<i>Stupid putz.!</i>

11
00:00:53,525 --> 00:00:56,915
Sounds like old double-dork
is missing a step or two.

12
00:00:56,995 --> 00:00:58,724
We recorded this?

13
00:00:58,797 --> 00:01:02,255
<i>It's all on tape.</i>
<i>It's locked in the memory bank.</i>

14
00:01:02,334 --> 00:01:06,464
<i>Listen, I think double-dork</i>
<i>is entitled to a quickie, don't you?</i>

15
00:01:06,538 --> 00:01:08,267
<i>Absolutely.</i>

16
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:11,229
<i>- You can erase that tape, can't you?</i>
<i>- The memory bank's locked.</i>

17
00:01:11,309 --> 00:01:14,301
<i>- But I can get in there.</i>
<i>- Good.</i>

18
00:01:18,884 --> 00:01:22,479
This mother hears through walls.
Fires 4,000 rounds a minute.

19
00:01:22,554 --> 00:01:26,513
- Peeks down dresses at 1 ,000 feet.
- There's more than that.

20
00:01:26,591 --> 00:01:30,482
This terminal is hooked
into every data bank there is.

21
00:01:30,562 --> 00:01:32,951
A dozen of these copters,
and you could run the country.

22
00:01:33,031 --> 00:01:35,829
Watch this. I feed it my name, right?

23
00:01:38,537 --> 00:01:42,667
They've got your whole life in here.

24
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:46,432
Hit mine.

25
00:01:47,546 --> 00:01:51,471
Murphy, Frankie.

26
00:02:02,794 --> 00:02:04,750
''File under repair''?

27
00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:07,389
Did you break your file?
That's weird.

28
00:02:07,465 --> 00:02:09,456
<i>Special base to</i> Blue Thunder.
<i>Come in.</i>

29
00:02:09,534 --> 00:02:11,024
<i>Blue Thunder.</i>

30
00:02:11,069 --> 00:02:14,095
- It's a wrap tonight. Come on home.
<i>- Ten-four.</i>

31
00:02:15,106 --> 00:02:17,438
I better get going.

32
00:02:17,509 --> 00:02:20,774
You better go, too, Mr. Fletcher.

33
00:02:20,845 --> 00:02:23,643
I'll come along when he's in.

34
00:02:23,715 --> 00:02:25,512
Yeah, right.

35
00:02:34,326 --> 00:02:38,251
Blue Thunder, <i>wind 2 70 degrees at 1 2.</i>

36
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:40,355
<i>Blue Thunder</i> to base. Final approach.

37
00:02:41,232 --> 00:02:45,123
Altimeter 2995.
Cleared to land.

38
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:04,916
Does your buddy Cochrane
drive a gray Corvette?

39
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:06,423
Yeah. Why?

40
00:03:06,491 --> 00:03:09,153
Check 9:00.
He's in some kind of hurry.

41
00:03:10,562 --> 00:03:11,995
Oh, yeah.

42
00:03:16,668 --> 00:03:19,762
- Check Cochrane out.
- On the computer?

43
00:03:19,838 --> 00:03:21,794
Yeah. I'm gonna tag along.

44
00:03:32,317 --> 00:03:36,447
Blue Thunder, <i>this is Tower.</i>
<i>Do you copy? Is there a problem?</i>

45
00:03:36,521 --> 00:03:38,682
That's Cochrane, F.E., U.S. Army.

46
00:03:41,226 --> 00:03:43,114
What's the F.E. stand for?

47
00:03:43,194 --> 00:03:46,391
- Fuck everybody.
- Marvy.

48
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:50,724
We're almost there.

49
00:03:50,802 --> 00:03:52,793
Blue Thunder, <i>this is Tower.</i>
<i>Do you copy?</i>

50
00:03:52,871 --> 00:03:57,695
- Coming in garbled. Can't read you.
- I got Washington.

51
00:04:00,512 --> 00:04:01,911
Go for it!

52
00:04:02,914 --> 00:04:05,610
Cannot read you, Special Base.
Still garbled.

53
00:04:05,684 --> 00:04:08,209
<i>Blue Thunder,</i> come in.
Do you read me?

54
00:04:08,286 --> 00:04:10,550
Breaking up, Special Base.
Can't read you.

55
00:04:10,622 --> 00:04:12,021
Still garbled.

56
00:04:15,293 --> 00:04:16,726
Here it comes.

57
00:04:18,663 --> 00:04:20,722
''Sole survivor.'' Is he kidding?

58
00:04:23,435 --> 00:04:25,232
''Project Thor''? Wait a minute.

59
00:04:25,303 --> 00:04:29,000
- I know what that is.
- Request information.

60
00:04:30,542 --> 00:04:34,501
Thor Project.

61
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:43,510
<i>I got it.</i>

62
00:04:43,555 --> 00:04:44,886
Here it comes.

63
00:04:44,956 --> 00:04:49,120
''Tactical Helicopter Offensive Response.''

64
00:04:52,764 --> 00:04:55,096
''Defensive Response''?

65
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:56,963
What does that mean?

66
00:04:57,035 --> 00:05:01,028
<i>Washington's jerking us around.</i>
<i>They've got bigger plans for this turkey.</i>

67
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:07,505
Blue Thunder, <i>you will acknowledge.</i>

68
00:05:07,579 --> 00:05:08,671
Shit!

69
00:05:10,048 --> 00:05:13,006
<i>Blue Thunder</i> to Special Base.

70
00:05:13,084 --> 00:05:14,711
Oh, shit!

71
00:05:31,469 --> 00:05:34,529
- Oh, he's going in there.
- Yeah.

72
00:05:34,606 --> 00:05:37,700
- Where are we?
- Federal Building.

73
00:05:37,776 --> 00:05:40,142
You wanna find out
what's going on in there?

74
00:05:40,211 --> 00:05:42,475
I certainly do.
Here goes the whisper mode.

75
00:05:56,694 --> 00:05:57,820
Get anything?

76
00:05:57,896 --> 00:06:01,127
I had a good shot of a couple guys
emptying trash.

77
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:02,598
Can't use it.

78
00:06:02,667 --> 00:06:05,295
<i>Murphy, what's going on out there?</i>

79
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:08,669
Captain Braddock, I hold you personally
responsible for that man's behavior.

80
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:12,130
Dr. Haycock strongly recommended
that he be grounded.

81
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:14,337
For your information, Mr. Icelan...

82
00:06:14,412 --> 00:06:18,200
there are no paranoid schizophrenics
on active duty here.

83
00:06:18,283 --> 00:06:20,205
He checks his sanity
with his wristwatch.

84
00:06:20,285 --> 00:06:23,140
What do you check yours with,
a dipstick?

85
00:06:24,756 --> 00:06:27,020
I don't have to take crap
from you, Braddock.

86
00:06:27,091 --> 00:06:29,013
He's finished as of now.

87
00:06:29,093 --> 00:06:31,391
If there's one scratch on that aircraft,
so are you.

88
00:06:32,263 --> 00:06:33,855
- Try the thermograph.
- Yeah.

89
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:42,536
- I told you it was cool.
- Lovely, lovely.

90
00:06:47,111 --> 00:06:48,840
Can you park it here?

91
00:06:48,913 --> 00:06:50,437
- I'll bring it around.
- I got something.

92
00:06:56,988 --> 00:06:59,286
- It locked!
- Yeah. Hold it.

93
00:07:04,162 --> 00:07:06,722
<i>I still fail to understand,</i>
<i>Mr. Holmes, Mr. Hornsby.</i>

94
00:07:06,798 --> 00:07:09,631
<i>The Astro Division was autonomous.</i>
<i>The man was assigned to us.</i>

95
00:07:09,701 --> 00:07:11,692
<i>- The McNeely business complicated it.</i>
- That's Fletcher.

96
00:07:11,769 --> 00:07:16,126
<i>McNeely,yes. I can't say you people</i>
<i>covered yourself with glory so far.</i>

97
00:07:16,207 --> 00:07:17,799
<i>If she hadn't started shouting...</i>

98
00:07:17,876 --> 00:07:21,209
it wouldn't have been necessary
to rough her up.

99
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:22,712
''Rough her up.''

100
00:07:24,315 --> 00:07:26,613
Is that the latest euphemism
for assassination?

101
00:07:26,684 --> 00:07:31,007
She had street informants,
and she'd already made the connection...

102
00:07:31,089 --> 00:07:33,649
<i>between our project</i>
<i>and the trouble on the streets.</i>

103
00:07:33,725 --> 00:07:37,217
<i>-She was going public, on the record.</i>
- Who are these other guys?

104
00:07:38,029 --> 00:07:40,395
- They can't hear me.
- Shut up anyway.

105
00:07:40,465 --> 00:07:43,764
<i>- This pilot</i>-
<i>- Frank Murphy.</i>

106
00:07:43,835 --> 00:07:47,032
<i>Is it under control? I want no premature</i>
<i>attention coming in the program.</i>

107
00:07:47,105 --> 00:07:49,630
Blue Thunder <i>might be perceived</i>
<i>as a threat.</i>

108
00:07:49,707 --> 00:07:51,629
<i>- Drop the hammer on him.</i>
<i>- What do you think, Colonel?</i>

109
00:07:51,709 --> 00:07:56,237
<i>I think, Mr. Holmes,</i>
<i>that I should take him out.</i>

110
00:07:56,314 --> 00:07:59,147
<i>You mean kill him? When?</i>

111
00:07:59,217 --> 00:08:01,014
<i>As soon as possible.</i>

112
00:08:01,085 --> 00:08:03,007
Jesus Christ!

113
00:08:03,087 --> 00:08:05,612
Boy's crazy about me, isn't he?
You got all this on tape?

114
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:08,318
- I got every word of it.
- Good.

115
00:08:08,393 --> 00:08:10,452
<i>Give him all the help he needs.</i>

116
00:08:10,528 --> 00:08:14,419
<i>This conversation never took place.</i>
<i>If it gets back to me, I'll deny it.</i>

117
00:08:19,103 --> 00:08:21,628
Oh, shit!

118
00:08:26,077 --> 00:08:29,274
Hold your nose. We're in deep shit.
Let's get the hell out of here.

119
00:08:44,629 --> 00:08:47,723
Blue Thunder <i>to Tower.</i>
<i>Wind 330 degrees at 1 5.</i>

120
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:50,563
<i>Altimeter 03002.</i>
<i>Clear to land?</i>

121
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:54,402
<i>Ten-twelve traffic, 1:00,</i>
<i>two miles northeast bound.</i>

122
00:08:54,472 --> 00:08:57,100
<i>It's a Cessna 1 82 at 5,000 VFR.</i>

123
00:08:57,175 --> 00:09:00,736
Blue Thunder <i>down at 2 1 30.</i>

124
00:09:00,812 --> 00:09:04,270
Captain Braddock wants to see you
in the office right away.

125
00:09:05,383 --> 00:09:07,305
I'm gonna get the key card
for the tape.

126
00:09:07,385 --> 00:09:08,818
Be careful.

127
00:09:13,725 --> 00:09:16,148
Yes, sir, I will.

128
00:09:16,227 --> 00:09:19,219
Well, sir, he's not that-

129
00:09:21,099 --> 00:09:23,590
Very well, sir. I will.

130
00:09:25,436 --> 00:09:27,597
All right, sir, I will.

131
00:09:27,672 --> 00:09:29,105
Yes, thank you.

132
00:09:31,476 --> 00:09:34,274
- Did you have a nice flight?
- I enjoyed it. Wish you could've come.

133
00:09:34,345 --> 00:09:36,870
I hope so, because it will be
your last one for a while.

134
00:09:36,948 --> 00:09:39,576
- Listen,Jack-
- No, you listen, Frank.

135
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:43,279
It's the way it's got to be. Me captain,
you cop. Me talk, you listen.

136
00:09:43,354 --> 00:09:46,380
If you notice I don't have an ass
when I get up...

137
00:09:46,457 --> 00:09:49,255
it's because the old man
just chewed it off just like that.

138
00:09:58,403 --> 00:10:02,669
You're beautiful when you're angry,
but I'd like a more private conversation.

139
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:05,629
We don't have any secrets
from Mr. Icelan.

140
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:08,975
You're off the program, Frank.
You and your buddy Lymangood.

141
00:10:09,047 --> 00:10:13,472
I'll be lucky if I'm not out in Pacoima
tomorrow driving a black-and-white.

142
00:10:16,254 --> 00:10:18,381
Captain Braddock speaking.

143
00:10:18,456 --> 00:10:20,549
Yes, sir, he's here, Colonel.

144
00:10:27,031 --> 00:10:29,864
Guys, don't forget to check
under the hood.

145
00:10:29,934 --> 00:10:31,993
Just gonna get my cuff links.

146
00:10:43,514 --> 00:10:46,506
Who do you think you're conning
with that phony radio bullshit?

147
00:10:46,584 --> 00:10:50,816
That went out the window three days
after Marconi invented the fucking thing.

148
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:58,090
Captain Braddock speaking.

149
00:11:00,264 --> 00:11:02,095
Yes, sir.

150
00:11:02,867 --> 00:11:04,789
Yes, sir, it's taken care of.

151
00:11:23,121 --> 00:11:26,887
- Who unlocked the memory bank?
- It was that tall cop.

152
00:11:28,693 --> 00:11:31,719
- You got it.
- Son of a bitch!

153
00:12:12,904 --> 00:12:14,826
Get his gun.

154
00:12:25,516 --> 00:12:28,144
Take it easy. Pay attention.

155
00:12:28,219 --> 00:12:30,107
Pay attention!

156
00:12:30,188 --> 00:12:33,043
We don't want to hurt you.
We want the tape.

157
00:12:34,225 --> 00:12:37,888
Let's be reasonable. You'll tell us
what we want to know sooner or later.

158
00:12:37,962 --> 00:12:40,590
I think you'd really rather
it be sooner.

159
00:12:40,665 --> 00:12:45,159
'Cause first I'm gonna break
your fingers.

160
00:12:45,236 --> 00:12:48,933
Then your arm.
Then maybe your knees.

161
00:12:50,141 --> 00:12:54,896
I know you don't believe me,
so I'm gonna show you.

162
00:13:04,255 --> 00:13:06,587
Now, can it be sooner?

163
00:13:08,025 --> 00:13:12,450
The tape. Is it in your car?

164
00:13:13,864 --> 00:13:16,059
Check the car.

165
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:37,439
You wanna tell us where it is.
Yeah.

166
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:41,521
You wanna write it down.

167
00:13:42,293 --> 00:13:43,726
Attaboy!

168
00:15:59,797 --> 00:16:03,563
<i>All units for information.</i>
<i>Detain and hold for questioning...</i>

172
00:16:13,677 --> 00:16:16,373
I wanna get a confirmation on that.

173
00:16:16,447 --> 00:16:18,677
This is Air 1 2 to Central.

174
00:16:18,749 --> 00:16:21,445
<i>Can we get a confirmation</i>
<i>on that last dispatch, please?</i>

175

180
00:17:04,128 --> 00:17:06,494
<i>I just heard about Lymangood.</i>

181
00:17:06,564 --> 00:17:10,056
<i>I'm really sorry.</i>
<i>Call me if you want to talk.</i>

182
00:17:51,242 --> 00:17:54,200
- Here's your tea, Colonel.
- Thank you.

183
00:17:54,278 --> 00:17:56,337
Why don't we just blank the tape?

184
00:17:56,413 --> 00:17:59,541
That's what it's designed for, right?

185
00:17:59,617 --> 00:18:03,348
They tell me Lymangood
changed the code numbers.

186
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:06,412
To go through every possible combination
would take forever.

187
00:18:10,995 --> 00:18:13,384
Trouble is, we don't have forever.

188
00:18:39,189 --> 00:18:42,249
<i>Hiya, boss. How's it goin'?</i>

189
00:18:42,326 --> 00:18:45,124
<i>Listen. I got the tape.</i>

190
00:18:45,195 --> 00:18:47,720
<i>But I can't take it home.</i>
<i>It doesn't feel safe to take it home.</i>

191
00:18:47,798 --> 00:18:49,823
<i>So I'm gonna take it</i>-

192
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:54,564
<i>There's this drive-in I go to</i>
<i>on Riverside and Victory, on the corner.</i>

193

<i>They've got a Dumpster in the back</i>

<i>till Monday, I think.</i>

195
00:19:01,745 --> 00:19:05,340
<i>That's where I'm gonna stash</i>
<i>the tape, okay?</i>

196
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:07,338
<i>This is gettin'fun, huh?</i>

197
00:19:07,418 --> 00:19:10,876
<i>Cops and robbers for real.</i>

198
00:19:10,955 --> 00:19:15,517
<i>Well, good luck if you should decide</i>
<i>to accept this mission.</i>

199
00:19:15,593 --> 00:19:18,551
<i>This is Lymangood.</i>

200
00:19:18,629 --> 00:19:23,054
<i>Yeah, I forgot to tell you.</i>
<i>I found out whatJAFO is.</i>

201

Get outta there. You're not supposed

203
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,310
You talking to me, asshole?

204
00:20:13,584 --> 00:20:15,381

<i>Los Angeles Mobile.</i>

<i>That number is listed</i>
<i>in your directory, sir.</i>

210
00:20:48,552 --> 00:20:52,648
Don't give me any static. This is
a police emergency. Get me KBLA-TV now.

211
00:20:54,558 --> 00:20:57,152
<i>Good afternoon. KBLA-TV.</i>

212
00:20:57,227 --> 00:20:59,787
<i>I want to speak to Mario Machado</i>
<i>or Alf Hewitt.</i>

213
00:20:59,863 --> 00:21:03,094
<i>They're not here. They're in the field.</i>
<i>Want to leave a message?</i>

214
00:21:03,167 --> 00:21:06,000
Tell them this is Officer Frank Murphy,
Astro Division.

215
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:08,630
I've got a package coming their way.
Do you read me?

216
00:21:08,706 --> 00:21:12,995
<i>- That's Frank Astro?</i>
- No. Frank Murphy, Astro Division.

217
00:21:13,077 --> 00:21:16,001
<i>Police emergency.</i>
<i>You got it, sweetheart?</i>

218
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,641
<i>- Yeah, I got it.</i>
<i>- Okay. Mobile?</i>

219
00:21:19,717 --> 00:21:22,515
<i>- Los Angeles Mobile.</i>
<i>- Listen, I need another number.</i>

220
00:21:26,356 --> 00:21:28,688
- Hello.
<i>- Kate, it's Frank.</i>

221
00:21:28,759 --> 00:21:30,681
Where are you?
I've been worried sick about you.

222
00:21:30,761 --> 00:21:33,457
I'm okay, baby.
I want you to pick up a package.

223
00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:37,887
<i>It's in a drive-in at the corner</i>
<i>of Victory and Riverside.</i>

224
00:21:37,968 --> 00:21:39,924
<i>It's near the concession stand.</i>

225
00:21:40,003 --> 00:21:41,595
<i>- It's in a Dumpster.</i>
- Then what?

226
00:21:41,672 --> 00:21:45,631
Take it to KBLA-TV,
to Mario Machado or Alf Hewitt.

227
00:21:45,709 --> 00:21:48,872
<i>- Don't stop for anything or anybody.</i>
- Got it.

228
00:21:48,946 --> 00:21:51,335
Okay. Thank you, baby.

229
00:21:59,623 --> 00:22:03,320
- Where is he now?
- Over the freeway interchange.

230
00:22:03,393 --> 00:22:06,885
Get the mayor's office on the phone
and the city emergency center.

231
00:22:06,964 --> 00:22:09,228
We're gonna get the air force now.
We're gonna get 'em now.

232
00:22:09,299 --> 00:22:14,054
He made two phone calls. The first to
channel 8, the second to his girlfriend.

233
00:22:14,138 --> 00:22:18,893
Forget about the police. Get our cars
over to her place and that TV station.

234
00:22:18,976 --> 00:22:21,001
It looks like the bastard
wants to go public.

235
00:22:21,044 --> 00:22:23,103
- We'll stop that.
- We'd better.

236
00:23:45,562 --> 00:23:47,484
Come on, move out!

237
00:23:49,867 --> 00:23:51,300
Move, move!

238
00:24:45,022 --> 00:24:48,082
- Damn it! I can't see nothin'!
- There she goes.

239
00:25:54,191 --> 00:25:56,887
<i>Air 7 to Special 1.</i>

240
00:25:58,562 --> 00:26:00,484
Air 7 to Special 1 .

241
00:26:04,368 --> 00:26:06,393
No shit, <i>pendejo.</i>

242
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:10,497
You gotta set that thing down.
We got two choppers full of SWAT guys.

243
00:26:14,044 --> 00:26:17,571
Oh-ho, it's getting cozy up here.

244
00:26:17,647 --> 00:26:20,377
Return to base,
or we'll open fire.

245
00:26:24,588 --> 00:26:26,385
Come on, will ya, Murphy?

246
00:26:29,726 --> 00:26:32,058
All right, knock him down.

247
00:26:35,999 --> 00:26:39,423
Okay, amigo. How's your
auto-rotation technique?

248
00:26:43,573 --> 00:26:44,665
Son of a bitch!

249
00:26:57,354 --> 00:26:58,685
Hang on!

250
00:27:02,059 --> 00:27:04,152
Sorry about that, my friend.

251
00:27:15,105 --> 00:27:17,767
Not again!

252
00:27:17,841 --> 00:27:21,106
All right, chaps.
How'd you like to follow my leader?

253
00:28:49,466 --> 00:28:51,058
Pull up! Pull up!

254
00:29:39,049 --> 00:29:41,210
<i>Okay, lady, pull over.</i>

255
00:29:52,429 --> 00:29:56,388
- Is there a problem, Officer?
- Yeah. A den mother in a Vega, right?

256
00:29:56,466 --> 00:30:00,095
Play it very cool.
I need your license and registration.

257
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:01,603
Sure.

258
00:30:07,677 --> 00:30:10,475
- Maybe I-
- Why don't you get out of the car?

259
00:31:19,082 --> 00:31:22,779
<i>For those who have tuned in late,</i>
<i>channel 8 brings you live coverage...</i>

260
00:31:22,852 --> 00:31:25,116
<i>of a helicopter hijacking.</i>

261
00:31:25,188 --> 00:31:28,578
<i>Stay inside your homes. There is</i>
<i>a sniper over the city of Los Angeles.</i>

262
00:31:28,658 --> 00:31:31,957
<i>We've already lost one police car</i>
<i>and two helicopters.</i>

263
00:31:32,028 --> 00:31:34,189
Well, what now, gentlemen?

264
00:31:34,264 --> 00:31:36,653
I don't plan on losing
any more of my helicopters.

265
00:31:36,733 --> 00:31:39,122
May I introduce Colonel Coe
of the air force?

266
00:31:39,202 --> 00:31:40,635
Colonel.

267
00:31:40,704 --> 00:31:43,434
We've got a couple of F-1 6s
standing by at March Field.

268
00:31:43,506 --> 00:31:47,294
- F-1 6s?
- We can take him out now. Say the word.

269
00:31:47,377 --> 00:31:50,835
If I may say so,
the F-1 6 is armed with rockets.

270
00:31:50,914 --> 00:31:54,270
Potential destruction of innocent
human beings is unimaginable.

271
00:31:54,351 --> 00:31:57,013
The F-1 6 is armed
with heat-seeking missiles.

272
00:31:57,087 --> 00:31:59,510
We can surgically remove him
from the air like a tumor.

273
00:31:59,589 --> 00:32:01,511
We're not talking about a tumor.

274
00:32:08,998 --> 00:32:11,125
<i>You gotta make a right there.</i>

275

''One Way''

00:32:31,988 --> 00:32:34,718
You're ridin' with the angels,
sweetheart.

277
00:33:03,453 --> 00:33:05,842
Atta girl! Good work.

278
00:33:21,438 --> 00:33:23,394
Got Ray Icelan at Astro Control.

279
00:33:23,473 --> 00:33:26,704
He says they've just scrambled
two F-1 6s out of March.

280
00:33:26,776 --> 00:33:28,732
- What about the tape?
- No sign of it.

281
00:33:28,812 --> 00:33:32,509
But he did make that call to KBLA.
Fletcher's standing by to intercept.

282
00:33:32,582 --> 00:33:35,312
<i>If you people would be calm,</i>
<i>I'll take care of you one at a time.</i>

283
00:33:35,385 --> 00:33:38,843
<i>We're gonna have more help.</i>
<i>Just keep calm.</i>

284
00:33:38,922 --> 00:33:43,882
Sir, I've got to get this tape
to Mr. Machado or ''Abe'' Hewitt.

285
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:47,418
-They're very busy.
- It's important. It's from Frank Murphy.

286
00:33:47,497 --> 00:33:49,556
There's a crazy man in a helicopter.

287
00:33:49,632 --> 00:33:52,157
If you'll sit down,
I'll tell somebody you're here.

288
00:33:52,235 --> 00:33:55,090
The most dangerous thing in the world
is a man afraid for his job.

289
00:33:55,171 --> 00:33:59,164
I'm Dick Fisher.
I'll get that to Mario if you like.

290
00:33:59,242 --> 00:34:03,406
- No, I have to give this to Mr. Mosher-
- Machado.

291
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:06,040
I'm his producer.
I'd be delighted to bring it to him.

292
00:34:06,883 --> 00:34:08,373
I don't think so.

293
00:34:08,418 --> 00:34:11,512
Can't we simply erase it?
Isn't that what the bug's for?

294
00:34:11,588 --> 00:34:13,544
We don't know the code number.

295
00:34:14,624 --> 00:34:16,751
Then erase them all.

296
00:34:16,826 --> 00:34:18,748
Why don't you give it to me?
I'll take it upstairs.

297
00:34:18,828 --> 00:34:22,025
Because Frank told me to give it
to Mr. Hewitt-

298
00:34:22,098 --> 00:34:25,693
Hi. I'm Alf Hewitt. You're the lady
with the tape from Frank Murphy, right?

299
00:34:25,768 --> 00:34:29,932
- Your producer said that Mr. Machado-
- Who?

300
00:34:30,006 --> 00:34:32,304
I never saw this guy before in my life.
Come on, let's go.

301
00:34:32,375 --> 00:34:34,502
Not so fast. That's government property!
Give me that!

302
00:34:34,577 --> 00:34:38,240
- Get your hands off me!
- Stop it! No!

303
00:34:38,314 --> 00:34:40,441
Bill, get this bastard off of me!

304
00:34:41,484 --> 00:34:43,679
You son of a bitch,
I'll blow your heads off!

305
00:34:45,522 --> 00:34:47,888
Go, go, go! I've got the tape.

306
00:34:47,957 --> 00:34:51,814
''Property Of U.S. Government''

307
00:35:15,585 --> 00:35:18,076
March Control,
this is Little Brother One.

308
00:35:18,121 --> 00:35:22,581
We have your target.
Bearing 1 21 at 1 3 miles.

309
00:35:22,659 --> 00:35:24,615
Request clearance to engage.

310
00:35:26,195 --> 00:35:27,856
<i>Roger, Little Brother.</i>

311
00:35:27,931 --> 00:35:31,492
<i>This is March Control. Affirmative.</i>
<i>Engage and destroy.</i>

312
00:35:31,568 --> 00:35:34,366
<i>I repeat.</i>
<i>Engage and destroy.</i>

313
00:35:45,848 --> 00:35:48,180
There he is.

314
00:35:48,251 --> 00:35:50,048
<i>He's all yours, cookie.</i>

315
00:36:51,948 --> 00:36:53,813
Holy shit!

316
00:37:06,929 --> 00:37:08,328
What?

317
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:11,760
Well, I'll be damned.

318
00:37:13,069 --> 00:37:17,529
Colonel, one of your missiles just took
out a barbecue shack in Little Tokyo.

319
00:37:17,607 --> 00:37:21,270
- Frances, isn't that Ray's district?
- Yes, it is.

320
00:37:21,344 --> 00:37:22,936
- Do you have his number?
- Right here.

321
00:37:23,012 --> 00:37:26,470
Give him a call, because they'll be
calling him, and he'll be calling us.

322
00:37:26,549 --> 00:37:27,982
I'm on my way.

323
00:38:07,290 --> 00:38:09,212
There he is right there.

324
00:38:13,496 --> 00:38:16,590
- This is an emergency.
<i>- Clear the area.</i>

325
00:38:16,666 --> 00:38:20,432
All right, clear the area.
Clear the area.

326
00:38:23,873 --> 00:38:28,037
Well, what do you know?
He froze.

327
00:38:28,111 --> 00:38:31,467
Okay, he's all mine now, Cookie.

328
00:39:00,877 --> 00:39:02,970
Oh, my God!

329
00:39:26,736 --> 00:39:28,567
I'm hit, Cookie! I'm hit!

330
00:39:28,638 --> 00:39:30,367
<i>He blew my wing off!.</i>

331
00:39:30,439 --> 00:39:34,864
<i>Mayday.! Mayday.! This is</i>
<i>Little Brother One. I'm ejecting.</i>

332
00:40:12,215 --> 00:40:16,037
Just lost an F-1 6 and the top
of the Arco Tower. What do we do now?

333
00:40:16,118 --> 00:40:18,109
That's it. Call it off.

334
00:40:18,187 --> 00:40:22,317
May I remind you there's a crazy man up
there with a six 20-millimeter cannon?

335
00:40:22,391 --> 00:40:23,824
Call it off.

336
00:40:23,893 --> 00:40:26,748
Request permission for takeoff.

337
00:40:26,829 --> 00:40:30,128
<i>Colonel, hold your position.</i>
<i>Operation cancelled.</i>

338
00:40:30,199 --> 00:40:34,295
<i>Repeat. Hold your position.</i>
<i>Do not take off.</i>

339
00:40:34,370 --> 00:40:35,803
<i>Thank you.</i>

340
00:42:08,764 --> 00:42:10,356
Back to base.

341
00:42:22,178 --> 00:42:26,035
<i>''Rough her up. ''Is that the latest</i>
<i>euphemism for assassination?</i>

342
00:42:26,115 --> 00:42:29,573
<i>She had street informants,</i>
<i>and she'd already made the connection...</i>

343
00:42:29,652 --> 00:42:31,711
<i>between our project</i>
<i>and the trouble in the streets.</i>

344
00:42:31,787 --> 00:42:33,914
Jesus Christ!
You ought to hear this stuff.

345
00:42:33,990 --> 00:42:36,185
These guys sound like cops and feds.

346
00:42:36,258 --> 00:42:39,216
They're stirring up trouble in the
barrio to prove what the chopper can do.

347
00:42:39,295 --> 00:42:41,456
It's all right here.

348
00:42:41,530 --> 00:42:44,328
You better tell Mario to go easy
on that ''Mad Sniper'' stuff.

349
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:48,029
That cop might be the hottest ticket
since Horatio set the bridge.

350
00:43:57,606 --> 00:43:59,972
All right, let's try this.

351
00:44:56,298 --> 00:44:57,731
Where are you?

352
00:45:33,602 --> 00:45:35,297
Damn it!

353
00:46:17,513 --> 00:46:22,473
All right, Murphy. It's about time
you put your money where your mouth is.

354
00:46:31,994 --> 00:46:35,521
One. Two. Three!

355
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:54,305
Come on, you tub of shit!

356
00:47:05,127 --> 00:47:06,788
That's impossible.

357
00:47:23,946 --> 00:47:25,504
Catch you later.

358
00:48:17,166 --> 00:48:20,795
Okay. And now it's your turn.

359
00:49:14,523 --> 00:49:16,912
<i>The $5 million prototype</i>
