My father once told me to be careful
of the things...

3
00:00:11,097 --> 00:00:13,822
...you love most in the world.

4
00:00:13,857 --> 00:00:15,929
Because if you're not careful...

5
00:00:17,466 --> 00:00:19,437
...that very thing can also destroy you.

6
00:00:24,571 --> 00:00:26,638
The bank called. They're gonna
take your boat.

7
00:00:27,264 --> 00:00:29,706
I had a job offer.
A lot of money.

8
00:00:29,741 --> 00:00:32,884
- What can I do for you?
- I'm going to offer you 100K Euros...

9
00:00:32,919 --> 00:00:35,126
...and took me in the water
with the great white shark.

10
00:00:35,161 --> 00:00:36,369
Outside the cage!

11
00:00:36,404 --> 00:00:40,770
I've spent ten years. It's taking me that long
to be able to get outside of the cage.

12
00:00:40,805 --> 00:00:42,116
You're gonna show us how is done.

13
00:00:42,151 --> 00:00:43,855
- Take his offer.
- Like it's that easy.

14
00:00:43,889 --> 00:00:45,613
- Why are you freaking now?
- 'Coz you told him...

15
00:00:45,648 --> 00:00:47,699
...he get this onto that.
I wasn't even sure I can do.

16
00:00:47,734 --> 00:00:50,000
Swim with the sharks...for me.

17
00:00:50,035 --> 00:00:51,825
That is the ultimate.

18
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:54,035
That's putting the courage on the line,
right?

19
00:00:56,343 --> 00:00:57,687
Let's do it.

20

and "INTO THE BLUE"

21
00:01:01,195 --> 00:01:02,783
- Where are we going?
- Shark Alley.

22
00:01:02,818 --> 00:01:04,732
There is big ones down there, right?

23
00:01:04,867 --> 00:01:06,821
- Twenty footers.
- Is safe out there?

24
00:01:06,856 --> 00:01:09,218
- Are you sure about this?
- Let's give him his money's worth.

25
00:01:09,253 --> 00:01:10,500
Let's do it!

28
00:01:17,054 --> 00:01:18,425
It's gonna be fine.

29
00:01:18,128 --> 00:01:22,592
HOLD
YOUR

30
00:01:24,325 --> 00:01:25,865
BREATH

31
00:01:28,457 --> 00:01:30,870
- Come on Al. What's going on?
- It's stuck!
