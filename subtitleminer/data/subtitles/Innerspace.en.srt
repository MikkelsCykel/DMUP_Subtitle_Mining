1
00:03:19,301 --> 00:03:23,897
...courageous men who risk
life and limb to explore the stars...

2
00:03:24,341 --> 00:03:28,016
...and secure peace and freedom
the world over.

3
00:03:28,701 --> 00:03:31,898
We are a nation
with a tradition of heroism....

4
00:03:32,701 --> 00:03:34,771
Does anybody know where the head is?

5
00:03:34,861 --> 00:03:36,613
...with us here tonight...

6
00:03:37,341 --> 00:03:38,660
...fill that need.

7
00:03:39,181 --> 00:03:42,617
Through their strength of character,
their fortitude...

8
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:47,538
...they have proven themselves
to be worthy of the appellation...

9
00:03:48,821 --> 00:03:49,890
...hero.

10
00:03:50,501 --> 00:03:52,651
Tonight we are paying tribute...

11
00:03:53,061 --> 00:03:54,540
...to a breed of men--

12
00:03:58,901 --> 00:04:01,256
Where can a guy take a leak around here?

13
00:04:09,141 --> 00:04:12,178
Well, damn if we're not balls to the wall...

14
00:04:12,261 --> 00:04:14,980
...with all-American hero types
here tonight.

15
00:04:15,861 --> 00:04:18,091
I see space walkers...

16
00:04:18,381 --> 00:04:21,976
...and moon walkers
and Earth orbiters galore.

17
00:04:22,981 --> 00:04:26,610
And over here,
we have the current cream of the crop.

18
00:04:27,021 --> 00:04:30,058
America's best and brightest.

19
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:33,057
That's a good one, boys.

20
00:04:33,421 --> 00:04:37,573
The most excitement I ever had
was the time I landed a crippled F-14...

21
00:04:37,661 --> 00:04:42,132
...with a stubborn nose gear on the deck
of a rolling flattop in zero visibility.

22
00:04:44,421 --> 00:04:46,139
But you boys...

23
00:04:46,781 --> 00:04:50,660
...you get to test out these babies.

24
00:04:52,421 --> 00:04:54,013
I envy you.

25
00:04:55,941 --> 00:04:58,694
Gentlemen, I salute you.

26
00:05:00,301 --> 00:05:01,973
Shit, I spilled my drink.

27
00:05:06,221 --> 00:05:07,654
Easy.

28
00:05:10,181 --> 00:05:12,251
Battle conditions, boys?

29
00:05:14,261 --> 00:05:16,729
Get yourself a new act. You're a disgrace.

30
00:05:16,821 --> 00:05:20,131
Give that crippled tomcat story a rest
because we've all heard it.

31
00:05:20,221 --> 00:05:23,657
Gosh, I'm sorry, Rusty.
Really, you're right.

32
00:05:24,461 --> 00:05:28,773
When my moment of truth came, I didn't
take a dump down the leg of my flight suit.

33
00:05:28,861 --> 00:05:30,533
You son of a--

34
00:05:35,021 --> 00:05:39,094
Come on. It's what you always wanted,
a piece of Tuck Pendelton.

35
00:05:41,901 --> 00:05:45,450
Shouldn't the project be declassified?

36
00:05:46,061 --> 00:05:47,653
You know I can't tell you that.

37
00:05:49,821 --> 00:05:52,016
Would you just excuse me? I'm sorry.

38
00:05:52,461 --> 00:05:55,339
All right, that's enough! That's enough!

39
00:05:59,341 --> 00:06:02,936
Hello, Pete. Where's your uniform?

40
00:06:03,661 --> 00:06:07,290
Where yours should've been
a long time ago. Hanging in the closet.

41
00:06:07,661 --> 00:06:10,300
Don't worry, Pete. The wait is almost over.

42
00:06:17,901 --> 00:06:19,698
Take him home, Lydia.

43
00:06:34,261 --> 00:06:36,092
Can you try to hit the couch?

44
00:06:37,341 --> 00:06:39,013
No wait, wait.

45
00:06:41,501 --> 00:06:43,890
All you had to do was ask, honey.

46
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:55,772
Charming. You want a drink?

47
00:07:01,821 --> 00:07:04,619
-What is all this?
-Something new I'm involved in.

48
00:07:05,141 --> 00:07:07,371
-Rabbits?
-Yeah, "wabbits."

49
00:07:08,061 --> 00:07:10,655
You resigned your commission
to study rabbits?

50
00:07:16,981 --> 00:07:19,973
-Now take it easy.
-That's good advice.

51
00:07:22,781 --> 00:07:24,658
You better get some ice on that.

52
00:07:24,741 --> 00:07:26,936
-Where are you going?
-I'm leaving.

53
00:07:27,421 --> 00:07:28,979
You're in no shape to drive.

54
00:07:29,061 --> 00:07:31,734
I am in no shape to drive.
That's really good, Tuck.

55
00:07:31,821 --> 00:07:33,413
You leave me no choice.

56
00:07:39,301 --> 00:07:41,656
-That's not fair.
-What is?

57
00:07:43,621 --> 00:07:45,976
"Straight to my lover's heart"

58
00:07:48,101 --> 00:07:49,375
Come on.

59
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:11,893
Hey, I told the man on the phone,
"Don't honk."

60
00:08:12,541 --> 00:08:15,499
All I got was an address,
not a book of instructions.

61
00:08:16,861 --> 00:08:19,216
-What's going on here?
-You got any bags?

62
00:08:19,301 --> 00:08:21,690
You know what's going on here.
You read the note.

63
00:08:21,781 --> 00:08:25,456
-I read the note.
-Clean break. Leave everything behind.

64
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:27,532
-I don't live here.
-One-nighter?

65
00:08:27,941 --> 00:08:29,897
Shut up and get in your cab!

66
00:08:30,221 --> 00:08:31,336
I read the note.

67
00:08:31,421 --> 00:08:34,299
It's your standard farewell address.
I know it by heart.

68
00:08:36,061 --> 00:08:37,653
-Excuse me.
-Lydia.

69
00:08:38,261 --> 00:08:41,458
Don't leave. You know you love me.

70
00:08:43,221 --> 00:08:45,291
I know you're crazy about me.

71
00:08:46,581 --> 00:08:51,530
In a week or two, I'll call you or
you'll call me and we'll be back together.

72
00:08:51,621 --> 00:08:53,020
No, we won't!

73
00:08:54,941 --> 00:08:58,251
I don't get it. I get a little drunk.

74
00:08:59,141 --> 00:09:00,972
I make an ass out of myself.

75
00:09:02,581 --> 00:09:05,300
-What's the big deal?
-Things are different now.

76
00:09:05,821 --> 00:09:08,255
It just hurts me too much to be with you.

77
00:09:08,701 --> 00:09:09,690
Lydia!

78
00:09:11,581 --> 00:09:16,416
Lydia, I stubbed my toe on the cab
when I kicked the door.

79
00:09:16,741 --> 00:09:18,254
I think it's broken.

80
00:09:18,941 --> 00:09:21,933
Better your toe than your heart.
Can we go now, please?

81
00:09:22,021 --> 00:09:23,010
Lydia!

82
00:09:35,461 --> 00:09:38,021
I hope you didn't leave your purse
back there.

83
00:09:52,261 --> 00:09:54,855
Okay, Jack. Let's review.

84
00:09:55,861 --> 00:09:58,933
We've got nausea, shortness of breath...

85
00:09:59,021 --> 00:10:00,773
...dizziness and headaches.

86
00:10:01,181 --> 00:10:03,251
Big, pounding headaches.

87
00:10:05,661 --> 00:10:09,256
What's going on up here?
Where did you get that rash?

88
00:10:09,341 --> 00:10:11,650
-Hairspray.
-Hairspray?

89
00:10:11,741 --> 00:10:13,493
It also makes me sneeze like crazy.

90
00:10:14,061 --> 00:10:17,610
-What do you think?
-I think you're allergic to hairspray.

91
00:10:18,381 --> 00:10:21,930
Isn't this great, Jack?
We're making real progress here today.

92
00:10:26,381 --> 00:10:29,020
The nightmares still keeping you awake
at night?

93
00:10:29,101 --> 00:10:30,454
Now I have a new one.

94
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:32,850
Put your head back. Tell me about it.

95
00:10:33,421 --> 00:10:36,697
I'm at the market,
working one of the registers.

96
00:10:37,181 --> 00:10:41,254
I suddenly notice that the next customer
is this horrible...

97
00:10:41,341 --> 00:10:43,571
...obnoxious woman
with bright orange hair.

98
00:10:46,581 --> 00:10:48,731
I'm passing her stuff over...

99
00:10:49,101 --> 00:10:51,695
...the bar code scanner. I don't notice it...

100
00:10:51,781 --> 00:10:54,375
...but the computer is ringing up
the wrong prices.

101
00:10:55,141 --> 00:11:00,090
So when I'm all done,
I look at the total and it's way up over...

102
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:05,092
...and it's way up over $100,000.

103
00:11:05,861 --> 00:11:10,218
So the woman with the orange hair
says to me, real calm...

104
00:11:10,781 --> 00:11:12,260
...she says to me:

105
00:11:12,381 --> 00:11:15,259
"I don't carry that kind of cash
around on me, sweetie."

106
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:16,410
Open wide.

107
00:11:19,981 --> 00:11:24,930
I say, "Oh, is that right?"
And she says, "Will you take this instead?"

108
00:11:25,901 --> 00:11:27,493
She reaches into her purse...

109
00:11:27,741 --> 00:11:30,460
...and pulls out a little pearl-handled pistol.

110
00:11:30,621 --> 00:11:35,172
She pulls back on the trigger
and at that moment I wake up screaming.

111
00:11:38,301 --> 00:11:42,214
Take it easy, Jack. It's all right.
The nurse will get it.

112
00:11:42,301 --> 00:11:43,814
Just sit down.

113
00:11:44,181 --> 00:11:46,456
I'm sorry, Jack.
I didn't mean to push you off.

114
00:11:47,861 --> 00:11:52,093
Jack, please, sit down and relax.
Catch your breath.

115
00:11:56,301 --> 00:11:59,498
You know that I am more than your doctor.
I'm your friend.

116
00:11:59,701 --> 00:12:02,454
You're one of my favorite patients.
Let's face it.

117
00:12:02,541 --> 00:12:06,580
Your regular office visits
are the cornerstone of my entire practice.

118
00:12:08,741 --> 00:12:11,778
The problem is,
medicine is not what you need, Jack.

119
00:12:11,861 --> 00:12:16,696
What you need is rest and relaxation.
A total change of scene.

120
00:12:17,141 --> 00:12:19,609
Maybe a nice vacation.
How does that sound?

121
00:12:20,701 --> 00:12:21,895
It sounds good.

122
00:12:21,981 --> 00:12:26,850
Then take one.
And find a place that's peaceful and quiet.

123
00:12:27,101 --> 00:12:31,652
The most important thing for you now
is no excitement.

124
00:12:32,701 --> 00:12:33,417
Got it?

125
00:12:34,621 --> 00:12:37,340
-I know it's hard to believe--
-Hard? Try "impossible."

126
00:12:37,941 --> 00:12:40,375
That's why I want you to see for yourself.

127
00:12:40,461 --> 00:12:42,895
Then, if you're interested,
the project is yours.

128
00:12:42,981 --> 00:12:45,541
First amaze me, then we'll talk funding.

129
00:12:46,821 --> 00:12:49,335
Damn this traffic. We're gonna be late.

130
00:12:49,421 --> 00:12:52,254
Just out of curiosity, who's your guy?
Your pilot?

131
00:12:52,501 --> 00:12:55,538
You might know him. Tuck Pendelton.

132
00:12:57,301 --> 00:13:00,611
-Why did you choose him?
-He had the right qualifications.

133
00:13:00,981 --> 00:13:04,735
-Such as?
-He was the only one crazy enough to do it.

134
00:13:05,981 --> 00:13:08,211
Let me tell you about Tuck Pendelton.

135
00:13:08,581 --> 00:13:11,971
He could have been one of the best.
But he hates authority...

136
00:13:12,061 --> 00:13:15,497
...he can't take orders,
and he likes to make up his own rules.

137
00:13:16,741 --> 00:13:18,618
Don't look so depressed.

138
00:13:19,261 --> 00:13:22,617
The experiment is bound to fail
long before Pendelton can screw it up.

139
00:13:23,741 --> 00:13:28,212
How does that feel? It feels good.
Then do it again.

140
00:13:30,621 --> 00:13:34,534
The Tuck Pendelton machine, zero defects.

141
00:13:35,301 --> 00:13:38,850
-You're not getting nervous, are you?
-Not yet.

142
00:13:39,541 --> 00:13:43,819
Let's review the neuromuscular
facial response experiment one more time.

143
00:13:43,901 --> 00:13:46,131
Let's not, all right?

144
00:13:47,021 --> 00:13:49,581
-What do you mean, "Let's not"?
-Who's nervous now?

145
00:13:49,981 --> 00:13:52,939
I know what our objectives are.
I've done my homework.

146
00:13:53,021 --> 00:13:57,333
I can do this little job blindfolded
and backwards, so everyone calm down.

147
00:14:01,101 --> 00:14:04,093
Alpha-level technicians,
report to monitoring stations.

148
00:14:12,861 --> 00:14:14,852
Optical sensor check commencing.

149
00:14:18,421 --> 00:14:20,491
Initiate hyper-conic speaker check.

150
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:23,289
Initiating.

151
00:14:28,421 --> 00:14:30,491
-Good luck, Lieutenant.
-Thank you.

152
00:14:31,541 --> 00:14:34,453
Zero minus five.
All personnel to their stations, please.

153
00:14:42,021 --> 00:14:44,057
Just one more thing, Lieutenant.

154
00:14:44,301 --> 00:14:46,417
I want to make sure
we've got everything down.

155
00:14:46,501 --> 00:14:50,016
It's not going to be simple,
but there shouldn't be any surprises or....

156
00:14:50,461 --> 00:14:52,019
Good luck, Lieutenant.

157
00:15:15,741 --> 00:15:18,619
Be careful of this unit.
I spilled coffee on it last week.

158
00:15:18,701 --> 00:15:21,090
It's not quite as reliable as it was.

159
00:15:21,861 --> 00:15:23,419
Still rolling? Great!

160
00:15:24,141 --> 00:15:26,780
We are using an experimental...

161
00:15:26,861 --> 00:15:30,217
...submersible pod,
modified with a performance-enhanced...

162
00:15:30,461 --> 00:15:33,021
...helium-neon laser scalpel
of our own design.

163
00:15:33,941 --> 00:15:35,374
This was a 50-milliwatt unit...

164
00:15:35,461 --> 00:15:37,691
...which we increased to 600 milliwatts....

165
00:15:37,781 --> 00:15:40,773
Just pay attention to your business there.

166
00:15:40,901 --> 00:15:42,254
600 milliwatts...

167
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:46,812
...which, in terms of spacial equivalency,
would be a 60-kilowatt unit.

168
00:15:46,901 --> 00:15:50,337
This is done because we have
such high efficiency, possible...

169
00:15:50,421 --> 00:15:54,539
...because of our enhanced spectral coding.
All surfaces within the laser assembly....

170
00:15:55,541 --> 00:16:00,137
This is done in a chamber,
which is constructed from a generator...

171
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:04,055
...coupled with
a common home carpet sweeper.

172
00:16:04,301 --> 00:16:06,940
Would you bring up the Biomed
on the specimen, please?

173
00:16:07,541 --> 00:16:11,375
Oxygen percentage, check.
Air tanks fully charged.

174
00:16:12,821 --> 00:16:15,381
Doppler phase translocator activated.

175
00:16:18,821 --> 00:16:20,174
State of the art.

176
00:16:20,421 --> 00:16:23,538
All personnel,
we are now at priority level one.

177
00:16:24,181 --> 00:16:25,660
Secure all stations.

178
00:16:32,981 --> 00:16:35,211
Environmental control systems, check.

179
00:16:37,421 --> 00:16:40,618
Gyro stabilization XYZ coordinates, check.

180
00:16:50,661 --> 00:16:52,936
Laser subsystem analysis, check.

181
00:16:53,461 --> 00:16:58,091
Pod lockdown and rotation complete.
Begin phase two of alignment.

182
00:17:03,501 --> 00:17:05,298
Prepare for shield closure.

183
00:17:22,181 --> 00:17:24,695
-Lieutenant, do you read me?
-Rock and roll.

184
00:17:24,821 --> 00:17:27,574
Stand by.
I need final confirmation from Biomed.

185
00:17:27,661 --> 00:17:28,696
Biomed complete.

186
00:17:28,781 --> 00:17:31,659
-And from optoelectrical station three.
-Three, check.

187
00:17:31,741 --> 00:17:33,140
-Station two.
-Two, check.

188
00:17:33,221 --> 00:17:34,939
-And the MRD?
-Entry point plotted.

189
00:17:35,021 --> 00:17:37,171
CC, do you confirm we're clear to proceed?

190
00:17:37,261 --> 00:17:38,933
Dr. Niles isn't here yet.

191
00:17:39,181 --> 00:17:41,570
That's his trouble, not mine.
Nothing I can do.

192
00:17:42,141 --> 00:17:44,052
Prepare PEM number one.

193
00:17:45,221 --> 00:17:47,530
Activate Photon Echo Memory system.

194
00:17:49,981 --> 00:17:51,494
Insert PEM number one.

195
00:17:51,581 --> 00:17:54,141
Commencing PEM number one's insertion.

196
00:18:05,301 --> 00:18:07,610
Open pre-feed to the hydroperc chamber.

197
00:18:12,301 --> 00:18:16,294
Pull up a display
on the photon densitometer.

198
00:18:17,501 --> 00:18:19,059
Stand by, Lieutenant.

199
00:18:21,821 --> 00:18:23,573
Insert PEM number two.

200
00:18:27,101 --> 00:18:29,661
These should have been on my desk
a week ago.

201
00:18:38,861 --> 00:18:41,739
Do you have any other papers
you haven't turned in?

202
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:53,860
Pod activated.

203
00:18:55,701 --> 00:18:57,532
Microchip interlock complete.

204
00:18:58,941 --> 00:19:01,501
Hold on to your breakfast, Lieutenant.
This is it.

205
00:19:01,581 --> 00:19:03,060
Activate centrifuge.

206
00:19:11,901 --> 00:19:13,493
Minus 40.

207
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:17,858
Commencing molecular isolation
and displacement.

208
00:19:21,541 --> 00:19:23,133
Minus 30.

209
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:31,940
Minus 20.

210
00:19:40,021 --> 00:19:41,420
Minus 10.

211
00:19:41,501 --> 00:19:45,255
9, 8, 7, 6...

212
00:19:45,341 --> 00:19:49,175
...5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

213
00:19:49,541 --> 00:19:50,576
Ignition.

214
00:20:17,981 --> 00:20:19,573
Sequence completed.

215
00:20:48,301 --> 00:20:50,337
-Can I help you fellows?
-Phone repair.

216
00:20:50,421 --> 00:20:52,013
Phone repair.

217
00:20:53,181 --> 00:20:55,900
Do you know anything
about phones being fixed today?

218
00:20:57,541 --> 00:20:59,133
Sorry, I don't--

219
00:21:05,141 --> 00:21:07,939
All technicians,
report to substation monitors.

220
00:21:30,381 --> 00:21:32,815
Prepare to interface with host organism.

221
00:21:40,381 --> 00:21:42,372
Synchronize life-support systems.

222
00:21:42,941 --> 00:21:45,455
We'll have you inside Bugs
in just a moment.

223
00:21:45,581 --> 00:21:47,651
Guys, I need help with the rodent.

224
00:22:21,821 --> 00:22:23,493
Look at this thing.

225
00:22:30,101 --> 00:22:32,490
Primitive. Definitely primitive.

226
00:22:57,781 --> 00:22:59,612
-Margaret?
-Ozzie.

227
00:23:01,461 --> 00:23:04,373
You've backed yourself
into a corner once again.

228
00:23:15,901 --> 00:23:17,175
Mr. Igoe...

229
00:23:17,501 --> 00:23:20,061
...stop him. We need that syringe.

230
00:23:40,301 --> 00:23:41,211
Ozzie?

231
00:23:41,301 --> 00:23:43,496
Ozzie, what the hell's going on out there?

232
00:24:36,221 --> 00:24:38,291
Ozzie, am I being punished?

233
00:25:28,861 --> 00:25:30,658
Mr. Putter.

234
00:25:31,901 --> 00:25:36,338
I certainly envy you.
Fun, excitement, relaxation.

235
00:25:36,861 --> 00:25:39,091
No excitement. Doctor's orders.

236
00:25:39,301 --> 00:25:42,338
How about a little shipboard romance?

237
00:25:43,261 --> 00:25:45,138
As long as it isn't too exciting.

238
00:27:28,581 --> 00:27:29,650
Get some help.

239
00:27:29,741 --> 00:27:31,379
Somebody call security.

240
00:27:52,821 --> 00:27:54,174
Did you see that?

241
00:28:13,021 --> 00:28:14,693
Automatic pilot now functioning.

242
00:28:14,781 --> 00:28:17,579
Please give command code
for environmental adjust.

243
00:28:45,541 --> 00:28:48,419
Jack, you're late.
You know it's coupon day.

244
00:28:48,781 --> 00:28:53,093
-You won't believe what happened to me.
-I don't want to hear about it. Later.

245
00:28:53,901 --> 00:28:57,132
Just punch in and get to work
at register five.

246
00:28:57,501 --> 00:29:00,061
Smell this. Go on, smell it.

247
00:29:16,021 --> 00:29:18,535
What the hell are these things? Fat cells?

248
00:29:23,181 --> 00:29:25,490
What the hell is going on out there?

249
00:29:26,341 --> 00:29:28,491
Mission Control, come in.
Do you read me?

250
00:29:30,301 --> 00:29:33,498
I blacked out. Am I inside Bugs or what?

251
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:39,220
Thanks, Craig.

252
00:29:39,301 --> 00:29:40,814
-You're late.
-I know.

253
00:29:41,381 --> 00:29:44,054
-How do I look?
-Like shit.

254
00:29:44,221 --> 00:29:45,620
I'm still shaking.

255
00:29:45,861 --> 00:29:48,819
-What happened?
-I had the most frightening experience.

256
00:29:48,901 --> 00:29:52,291
Talk about frightening experiences.
Have you ever slam danced?

257
00:29:52,381 --> 00:29:55,373
-Never mind.
-That's where you were.

258
00:29:56,221 --> 00:30:00,214
-We had a date last night.
-Oh, yeah, I forgot.

259
00:30:00,461 --> 00:30:05,012
-Forgot? How could you forget?
-Jack, I've already told you.

260
00:30:05,221 --> 00:30:08,497
If you want to be part of my life,
you can't hassle me about stuff.

261
00:30:09,101 --> 00:30:11,456
Wendy, I'm not a part of your life.

262
00:30:18,741 --> 00:30:19,810
Well?

263
00:30:22,781 --> 00:30:26,171
-I'm in a hurry.
-Yes, you are.

264
00:30:27,101 --> 00:30:28,773
Just add it up, will you?

265
00:30:30,461 --> 00:30:34,090
Ozzie, if you can hear me,
I'll try to restore contact from your end...

266
00:30:34,181 --> 00:30:37,093
...by activating
one of the electromagnetic booster cells.

267
00:30:37,221 --> 00:30:38,097
Stand by.

268
00:30:50,261 --> 00:30:52,729
That's kind of pricey for shampoo, ain't it?

269
00:30:53,261 --> 00:30:54,250
Ozzie!

270
00:30:59,301 --> 00:31:01,371
$128,000?

271
00:31:02,061 --> 00:31:04,211
Is that with or without the coupons?

272
00:31:08,061 --> 00:31:10,017
What have you done, Jack?

273
00:31:11,381 --> 00:31:12,860
-It's a dream.
-What?

274
00:31:13,021 --> 00:31:14,215
It's a dream.

275
00:31:14,461 --> 00:31:16,053
Jack, way to screw up!

276
00:31:16,221 --> 00:31:19,896
Listen, sweetie,
I don't carry that kind of cash on me.

277
00:31:32,661 --> 00:31:34,538
Get ahold of yourself, Jack.

278
00:31:34,701 --> 00:31:37,977
I need some aspirin.
I'm begging you for some aspirin!

279
00:31:38,141 --> 00:31:39,733
Here!

280
00:31:43,141 --> 00:31:45,894
Hey, I'm not buying that aspirin now!

281
00:31:45,981 --> 00:31:48,051
At $800 a bottle, who'd want to?

282
00:31:48,941 --> 00:31:53,332
Jack, you're becoming unglued.
You're coming apart at the seams.

283
00:31:53,981 --> 00:31:57,132
Oh, my God, he's completely spaced out.

284
00:31:57,221 --> 00:31:58,654
Let me handle this.

285
00:32:00,701 --> 00:32:01,611
Jack.

286
00:32:03,901 --> 00:32:06,096
What the hell is that? Ozzie!

287
00:32:07,821 --> 00:32:10,540
Ozzie, I can't hear you.
I hope you can hear me.

288
00:32:12,101 --> 00:32:15,332
I'll proceed with the mission as planned.
Going to auto pilot.

289
00:32:17,341 --> 00:32:18,774
Phase one:

290
00:32:19,261 --> 00:32:20,933
Optic nerve interface.

291
00:32:21,621 --> 00:32:23,577
Come on, baby, show me the way.

292
00:32:25,981 --> 00:32:27,175
"Please wait"?

293
00:32:27,301 --> 00:32:31,260
"Environmental adjust required"?
Doesn't anything work?

294
00:32:31,341 --> 00:32:35,334
Pathway to optic nerve is as follows:
Superior gluteal vein to iliac vein...

295
00:32:35,421 --> 00:32:37,730
...to inferior vena cava
passed right atrium...

296
00:32:37,821 --> 00:32:41,097
...to superior vena cava
to right jugular vein to optic chiasma.

297
00:32:41,181 --> 00:32:42,296
Let's drive.

298
00:32:53,901 --> 00:32:55,414
Entering bloodstream.

299
00:33:00,981 --> 00:33:03,131
You've always been like a son to me.

300
00:33:03,701 --> 00:33:05,771
Well, a nephew, anyway.

301
00:33:07,341 --> 00:33:10,811
You've got a great future ahead of you
in retail food marketing.

302
00:33:13,021 --> 00:33:17,173
I'd hate to see you throw it all away
by going psycho on us.

303
00:33:29,261 --> 00:33:32,173
-Coffee. Thank you.
-I got it down the hall.

304
00:33:32,501 --> 00:33:33,775
Smoking.

305
00:33:44,701 --> 00:33:46,293
Deploying optic remote.

306
00:33:46,821 --> 00:33:50,416
Optic sensor armed and ready.
Switch to manual projectory control.

307
00:33:58,181 --> 00:33:59,933
Firing optic sensor.

308
00:34:10,941 --> 00:34:14,411
What's wrong, Jack? Let me see.

309
00:34:14,701 --> 00:34:16,612
Let me see.

310
00:34:17,101 --> 00:34:19,376
Come on, where the hell is the picture?

311
00:34:20,861 --> 00:34:22,613
All right, Oz!

312
00:34:24,621 --> 00:34:28,296
That's not Oz. Who the hell is that?
Where's the lab technician?

313
00:34:28,861 --> 00:34:30,453
Where's the lab?

314
00:34:30,581 --> 00:34:33,300
It was just so strange. It was like...

315
00:34:34,101 --> 00:34:37,457
...someone suddenly shoved
a white-hot needle through my eye.

316
00:34:37,661 --> 00:34:39,174
Oh, God!

317
00:34:41,101 --> 00:34:43,012
You stand up now, Jack.

318
00:34:43,501 --> 00:34:44,695
What is this?

319
00:34:46,021 --> 00:34:49,650
Did Bugs just stand up?
What's going on? This can't be.

320
00:34:53,501 --> 00:34:54,980
I'm in a man!

321
00:34:56,061 --> 00:34:58,859
I'm in a strange man!
I'll be a son of a bitch.

322
00:34:58,941 --> 00:35:00,374
I'm in a strange man...

323
00:35:00,461 --> 00:35:03,021
...surrounded by strangers
in a strange room!

324
00:35:03,301 --> 00:35:06,020
Go home and start your vacation today.

325
00:35:06,101 --> 00:35:10,219
This afternoon, Jack.
And you come back to us a new man.

326
00:35:11,421 --> 00:35:13,571
Do you mind if I call my doctor?

327
00:35:13,661 --> 00:35:17,017
Go right ahead, Jack. What a good idea.

328
00:35:19,221 --> 00:35:23,692
Ozzie, what have you done?
I can't be inside a man. I studied rabbits!

329
00:35:24,621 --> 00:35:25,895
I gotta talk to this guy.

330
00:35:25,981 --> 00:35:27,733
Pathway to middle ear is as follows....

331
00:35:33,981 --> 00:35:35,972
Miniaturization is achieved...

332
00:35:36,061 --> 00:35:39,895
...by pairing two 500 series
Photon Echo Memory chips...

333
00:35:40,021 --> 00:35:43,058
...or PEMS as we call them,
a controller and a remote.

334
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:45,575
Only the controller
is needed for miniaturization...

335
00:35:45,661 --> 00:35:48,619
...but a combination of the two chips
must be used to re-enlarge.

336
00:35:58,021 --> 00:36:00,251
"J. Putter, Assistant Manager."

337
00:36:01,501 --> 00:36:02,695
Find him.

338
00:36:36,581 --> 00:36:38,492
Approaching middle ear.

339
00:37:13,461 --> 00:37:16,578
Hello, can you hear me?

340
00:37:24,901 --> 00:37:28,576
Repeat. Repeat.
Respond if you can hear me.

341
00:37:31,501 --> 00:37:34,299
-Who, me?
-It works. I can hear you!

342
00:37:37,781 --> 00:37:39,658
Would you talk to me, please?

343
00:37:44,701 --> 00:37:46,692
Who are you? What's your name?

344
00:37:52,661 --> 00:37:53,730
What?

345
00:37:54,661 --> 00:37:57,221
-Are you talking to me?
-No.

346
00:37:58,741 --> 00:38:00,732
I'm not out there. I'm in here.

347
00:38:02,221 --> 00:38:04,291
-Did you hear that?
-Hear what?

348
00:38:05,501 --> 00:38:07,219
You didn't hear that then?

349
00:38:08,341 --> 00:38:12,971
No, I'm sorry. I didn't hear anything.
Are you feeling all right?

350
00:38:15,981 --> 00:38:19,212
Would I be in a doctor's office
if I was feeling all right?

351
00:38:19,741 --> 00:38:21,333
Pal, we have to talk.

352
00:38:21,661 --> 00:38:23,060
-No, we don't.
-Don't what?

353
00:38:23,141 --> 00:38:24,494
-Don't have to talk.
-Yes, we do.

354
00:38:24,581 --> 00:38:25,491
-We do?
-Do what?

355
00:38:25,581 --> 00:38:27,492
-Have to talk.
-Not unless you want to.

356
00:38:27,581 --> 00:38:30,937
I'm in here, inside you! lnside your body!

357
00:38:33,221 --> 00:38:34,415
Oh, God!

358
00:38:34,941 --> 00:38:38,616
Somebody, help me. I'm possessed!

359
00:38:47,741 --> 00:38:49,333
Good news, Jack.

360
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:53,051
We can rule out demonic possession
right off the bat.

361
00:38:53,741 --> 00:38:55,732
But this little voice is talking to me.

362
00:38:55,821 --> 00:38:59,894
That proves it.
Demons talk through you, not to you.

363
00:39:02,221 --> 00:39:03,893
Jack, what are you doing?

364
00:39:04,061 --> 00:39:07,656
I started to hyperventilate.
This usually does the trick.

365
00:39:12,141 --> 00:39:14,291
You're okay? You're not shaky?

366
00:39:14,661 --> 00:39:17,095
Thank God! A doctor!
Somebody who'll understand.

367
00:39:17,181 --> 00:39:18,933
Tell your doctor I'm in the tympanic....

368
00:39:19,021 --> 00:39:21,740
It's happening right now. Quick!
I hear it now.

369
00:39:21,981 --> 00:39:25,576
Take it easy.
Just sit down and I'll check into it.

370
00:39:26,301 --> 00:39:28,257
What are you waiting for? Tell him!

371
00:39:29,181 --> 00:39:30,933
Are you deaf?. Tell him!

372
00:39:31,341 --> 00:39:34,060
Relax, Jack.
Let's see what is going on in here.

373
00:39:35,381 --> 00:39:37,497
I'm blind! Oh, God!

374
00:39:37,581 --> 00:39:39,253
Now it's talking about God.

375
00:39:41,821 --> 00:39:45,257
You're experiencing
some sort of theistic hysteria.

376
00:39:46,221 --> 00:39:47,973
How do you treat that?

377
00:39:48,501 --> 00:39:50,890
Well, the medieval remedy...

378
00:39:50,981 --> 00:39:54,212
...was to flay the skin off your body
with brands of fire.

379
00:39:54,981 --> 00:39:57,541
I have no idea what the current thinking is.

380
00:40:04,141 --> 00:40:08,293
It's just a little theistic hysteria,
which is nothing.

381
00:40:34,381 --> 00:40:35,450
I can see!

382
00:40:35,541 --> 00:40:37,452
Thank God! I can see!

383
00:40:37,541 --> 00:40:39,293
-Jack.
-He knows my name.

384
00:40:41,301 --> 00:40:43,132
-Jack. We have to talk.
-No!

385
00:40:44,021 --> 00:40:45,613
We have a little problem here.

386
00:40:45,941 --> 00:40:50,173
I wonder what's on the television?
TV is so much fun around now.

387
00:40:50,261 --> 00:40:51,740
Jack! Pay attention!

388
00:40:51,821 --> 00:40:53,652
This is a good one.

389
00:40:53,941 --> 00:40:56,660
You can't watch TV. We have to talk.

390
00:40:57,141 --> 00:40:59,211
Oh, no. I'm inside a guy
who likes game shows.

391
00:40:59,701 --> 00:41:00,770
Try a vowel.

392
00:41:00,861 --> 00:41:04,297
I have no choice. I'm going to hit you
with my electromagnetic booster.

393
00:41:07,421 --> 00:41:09,332
Okay, buddy boy, here we go.

394
00:41:15,421 --> 00:41:17,013
Fire! Fire!

395
00:41:19,381 --> 00:41:21,895
Hey, Jack, you want to watch TV?
Watch this.

396
00:41:23,941 --> 00:41:25,499
Primary coil overload.

397
00:41:37,461 --> 00:41:40,817
You see that I am real.
You do believe me now, don't you?

398
00:41:43,301 --> 00:41:45,178
I don't know what to believe.

399
00:41:46,101 --> 00:41:49,059
Believe it, Jack.
Believe it because it's true.

400
00:41:50,261 --> 00:41:52,821
Now I want you to listen to me
and listen good.

401
00:41:52,901 --> 00:41:54,016
-All right?
-Yes.

402
00:41:54,101 --> 00:41:57,252
We're in this together
and we got to help each other out.

403
00:41:58,461 --> 00:42:00,531
You don't work at the lab, do you?

404
00:42:01,021 --> 00:42:03,091
Lab? No, I work at Safeway.

405
00:42:03,941 --> 00:42:06,694
And you don't know anything
about the experiment?

406
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:08,374
What experiment?

407
00:42:08,981 --> 00:42:10,255
Oh, God!

408
00:42:10,581 --> 00:42:13,334
-The miniaturization experiment.
-No.

409
00:42:16,021 --> 00:42:18,251
My name is Lieutenant Tuck Pendelton.

410
00:42:19,021 --> 00:42:20,739
I've been miniaturized.

411
00:42:20,901 --> 00:42:24,257
I was supposed to be injected
into the body of a lab rabbit...

412
00:42:24,341 --> 00:42:26,775
...and somehow I got inside you instead.

413
00:42:27,701 --> 00:42:29,293
What do you mean "somehow"? How?

414
00:42:29,421 --> 00:42:33,858
All I know is I was inside a syringe
and now I'm inside you.

415
00:42:45,781 --> 00:42:48,295
-Are you Jack Potter?
-Putter.

416
00:42:48,781 --> 00:42:50,772
-This yours?
-Yes.

417
00:42:51,701 --> 00:42:54,898
I'm from Cook Travel Agency.
Sign in number 12.

418
00:42:55,381 --> 00:42:57,941
I think these are cruise tickets,
if I'm not mistaken.

419
00:42:59,181 --> 00:43:01,058
-Thank you very much.
-You're welcome.

420
00:43:01,141 --> 00:43:02,654
Can I use your phone?

421
00:43:03,501 --> 00:43:04,934
Sure, go ahead.

422
00:43:10,021 --> 00:43:11,693
Thanks, appreciate it.

423
00:43:12,261 --> 00:43:13,774
Shot your TV out, man?

424
00:43:14,261 --> 00:43:15,853
Just like Elvis.

425
00:43:16,341 --> 00:43:18,616
You're a lucky guy, going on a cruise.

426
00:43:20,341 --> 00:43:23,060
-Taking your roommate?
-I don't have a roommate.

427
00:43:23,141 --> 00:43:25,291
I thought I heard you talking to someone.

428
00:43:25,541 --> 00:43:27,850
Don't trust him. He's not a messenger.

429
00:43:27,941 --> 00:43:29,056
I made the drop.

430
00:43:29,141 --> 00:43:30,210
How do you know?

431
00:43:30,301 --> 00:43:33,179
Gut reaction. Get out. Get out right now!

432
00:43:33,701 --> 00:43:34,895
Piece of cake.

433
00:43:35,381 --> 00:43:37,292
Where you going, man?

434
00:43:37,501 --> 00:43:38,456
Grab it!

435
00:43:43,581 --> 00:43:45,651
Jack, your pulse rate. I'm going too fast!

436
00:43:54,901 --> 00:43:57,540
Put your knee up.
Kick him where it counts.

437
00:43:58,741 --> 00:44:01,016
Now hit him! Run!

438
00:44:14,101 --> 00:44:16,012
Tuck, what's going on?

439
00:44:21,141 --> 00:44:25,180
Jack, you did real good.
Try and calm down.

440
00:44:25,781 --> 00:44:29,535
I've got a little problem here.
I'm going off radio contact for a minute.

441
00:44:29,621 --> 00:44:30,736
Shit!

442
00:44:40,701 --> 00:44:43,454
Approaching tricuspid valve of heart.
Do not enter.

443
00:44:43,541 --> 00:44:45,452
-Do not enter heart.
-Back, baby, back!

444
00:44:49,781 --> 00:44:51,533
Turbo thrusters at maximum.

445
00:44:56,981 --> 00:44:59,370
Warning:
Cardiovascular threshold exceeded.

446
00:45:11,181 --> 00:45:13,900
Cardiac arrest imminent.
Take evasive action.

447
00:45:23,021 --> 00:45:24,579
Just a little further!

448
00:45:29,421 --> 00:45:30,740
This won't hurt a bit.

449
00:45:33,621 --> 00:45:37,136
Up! Up! Up! That's it! Let's go!

450
00:45:47,861 --> 00:45:50,091
You've got one hell of a pump, Jack.

451
00:45:50,261 --> 00:45:53,651
-Where have you been?
-Never mind. Let's just get to the lab.

452
00:45:54,901 --> 00:45:57,574
You mean to tell me
he can actually talk to you?

453
00:45:57,661 --> 00:46:02,576
Yes. And I can talk to him.
Also, he's able to see everything that I see.

454
00:46:02,661 --> 00:46:06,449
He's patched into the optic nerve and
eardrum. It was part of the experiment...

455
00:46:06,541 --> 00:46:10,500
...to see if we could make audio
and visual contact with the host organism.

456
00:46:10,581 --> 00:46:14,415
-Come on, Doc, this is a guy, not a bunny!
-The computer doesn't know that.

457
00:46:14,501 --> 00:46:17,857
It simply reads the environment
and makes the proper adjustments.

458
00:46:18,141 --> 00:46:21,213
-Can you see me, Lieutenant Pendelton?
-Yeah, I can see you.

459
00:46:21,301 --> 00:46:22,495
Yes, he can.

460
00:46:23,661 --> 00:46:26,698
Good work! Job well done!

461
00:46:26,781 --> 00:46:30,740
Good work! I can't believe this!
Find out what went wrong.

462
00:46:30,981 --> 00:46:34,178
The lieutenant is wondering
what went wrong.

463
00:46:34,261 --> 00:46:37,333
I'll tell you.
You threw in with a bunch of eggheads...

464
00:46:37,421 --> 00:46:39,332
...who know squat about security.

465
00:46:39,421 --> 00:46:42,936
-Thanks for the hot tip.
-But don't worry, buddy.

466
00:46:43,061 --> 00:46:45,859
We'll do all we can
to get you out of this civilian.

467
00:46:45,941 --> 00:46:48,375
You better, you two-faced son of a bitch!

468
00:46:49,461 --> 00:46:51,417
-Tuck says, "Thank you."
-Yeah.

469
00:46:52,501 --> 00:46:53,854
Excuse us a minute.

470
00:46:53,941 --> 00:46:55,693
Let me talk to you outside.

471
00:46:56,941 --> 00:46:59,171
Stay here. Both of you.

472
00:47:00,461 --> 00:47:01,735
That's good.

473
00:47:03,221 --> 00:47:04,734
You're home free now.

474
00:47:04,821 --> 00:47:08,416
I never trusted Pete Blanchard.
Can you see where they went?

475
00:47:10,781 --> 00:47:12,817
Yes, hold on, yes.

476
00:47:13,461 --> 00:47:17,454
Look directly at them. I think
I can beef up the reception a bit.

477
00:47:20,261 --> 00:47:23,219
I'm trying to explain to you
exactly what's going on.

478
00:47:23,381 --> 00:47:26,134
We're not the only ones
working on miniaturization.

479
00:47:26,221 --> 00:47:28,337
Don't you think I know that, Niles?

480
00:47:28,501 --> 00:47:30,935
-I can hear them.
-I know. Shut up and listen.

481
00:47:31,021 --> 00:47:31,931
Sorry.

482
00:47:32,021 --> 00:47:35,093
We are the first to perfect
the tricky re-enlargement process...

483
00:47:35,221 --> 00:47:38,372
...by using two chips.
One of the chips is in the pod.

484
00:47:38,461 --> 00:47:41,533
The other one has been stolen.
Now how do we save Pendelton?

485
00:47:41,621 --> 00:47:44,010
-Find the stolen chip.
-Don't you have duplicates?

486
00:47:44,101 --> 00:47:45,614
No! They're prototypes!

487
00:47:45,861 --> 00:47:47,419
That's thinking ahead, Niles.

488
00:47:47,501 --> 00:47:48,980
We can make duplicates.

489
00:47:49,061 --> 00:47:52,019
-But not by 9:00 a.m. tomorrow.
-What happens at 9:00?

490
00:47:52,861 --> 00:47:55,819
By 9:00 his air supply runs out.

491
00:47:56,021 --> 00:47:57,852
That is no problem.

492
00:47:57,941 --> 00:48:01,980
He can go to the guy's lungs, open
the hatch and breathe the air he needs.

493
00:48:02,341 --> 00:48:03,740
He can't open the hatch!

494
00:48:03,821 --> 00:48:07,860
The sudden change in the cabin pressure
would make the pod explode like a balloon.

495
00:48:07,941 --> 00:48:09,374
That's right, Einstein.

496
00:48:09,461 --> 00:48:12,259
-Then we don't have to do anything.
-What do you mean?

497
00:48:12,341 --> 00:48:16,254
The stolen chip is useless
without the one in the pod, which we have.

498
00:48:16,941 --> 00:48:18,499
Build your duplicates.

499
00:48:18,581 --> 00:48:21,891
It doesn't matter how long it takes,
we'll be back in business.

500
00:48:21,981 --> 00:48:25,530
-What about Pendelton?
-We can't save him. That's too bad.

501
00:48:26,021 --> 00:48:27,215
Thanks, Pete.

502
00:48:27,501 --> 00:48:31,016
Maybe we can use him
to bring the thieves out into the open.

503
00:48:33,541 --> 00:48:34,576
-Find it?
-Yeah.

504
00:48:34,661 --> 00:48:38,370
Put it on. Keys are in the pocket.
Car's out back. See that door?

505
00:48:38,741 --> 00:48:39,856
Use it.

506
00:48:41,861 --> 00:48:43,294
What are you waiting on?

507
00:48:43,381 --> 00:48:46,976
Don't rush me!
Be quiet and let me think this through.

508
00:48:47,061 --> 00:48:50,815
I want you to factor this into your thinking.
You heard the guy.

509
00:48:50,901 --> 00:48:52,493
My air supply is running out.

510
00:48:52,581 --> 00:48:56,972
If you don't help me,
you'll end up with this miniaturized pod...

511
00:48:57,061 --> 00:49:01,577
...floating around your insides with this
teeny human skeleton at the helm.

512
00:49:03,221 --> 00:49:04,893
Not a pretty thought.

513
00:49:05,941 --> 00:49:06,930
All right.

514
00:49:07,221 --> 00:49:10,213
-But you have to do something for me.
-Anything. Let's just go.

515
00:49:12,181 --> 00:49:15,378
The red Mustang convertible.
You see it? It's over there.

516
00:49:18,421 --> 00:49:23,097
Careful! This isn't a Honda.
There's 500 horses underneath this baby.

517
00:49:24,181 --> 00:49:27,378
Use the clutch! It's a five-speed stick!

518
00:49:37,301 --> 00:49:39,053
Oh, that's great, Doc!

519
00:49:41,861 --> 00:49:43,214
-No pain.
-What?

520
00:49:43,541 --> 00:49:46,101
That's what I want from you. No pain.

521
00:49:48,661 --> 00:49:51,380
Don't do anything weird in there, okay?

522
00:49:51,821 --> 00:49:55,177
Don't cause an embolism
or an aneurysm or...

523
00:49:55,861 --> 00:49:59,536
...sever my spinal cord and just go,
"Oh, sorry! "

524
00:49:59,621 --> 00:50:00,940
Do you know what I mean?

525
00:50:01,221 --> 00:50:03,371
-Okay, no pain.
-Thank you.

526
00:50:10,501 --> 00:50:12,093
Home sweet home.

527
00:50:12,181 --> 00:50:16,891
-Is this where you live?
-Yeah, ain't it great? I call it user-friendly.

528
00:50:18,341 --> 00:50:19,535
What's this thing?

529
00:50:19,621 --> 00:50:23,614
Something else from Vector-Scope
that doesn't work. Never mind that.

530
00:50:24,661 --> 00:50:26,970
I need a drink. How about you?

531
00:50:27,101 --> 00:50:29,979
No, I don't drink.

532
00:50:30,101 --> 00:50:33,537
You do now, because I can't have a drink
unless you have a drink.

533
00:50:33,621 --> 00:50:34,815
Get the picture?

534
00:50:34,901 --> 00:50:37,620
See the table
with the motorcycle engine on top?

535
00:50:38,101 --> 00:50:39,819
-Yeah.
-Check the cylinder.

536
00:50:46,261 --> 00:50:47,376
Empty.

537
00:50:47,901 --> 00:50:51,576
Yeah, right.
Check the sink with the big fish in it.

538
00:50:51,661 --> 00:50:55,131
-A bottle of Southern Comfort?
-Yeah, it's here.

539
00:50:55,221 --> 00:50:59,737
I want you to take a big old tug
on that baby.

540
00:50:59,821 --> 00:51:01,539
I'll do the rest, all right?

541
00:51:03,541 --> 00:51:05,657
We're gonna drink this one to Ozzie.

542
00:51:06,461 --> 00:51:10,534
A good man who tried to save my ass
by injecting me into yours.

543
00:51:12,381 --> 00:51:13,370
To Ozzie.

544
00:51:20,301 --> 00:51:21,973
Come on, lucky flask.

545
00:51:38,101 --> 00:51:39,420
Great, Jack.

546
00:51:41,541 --> 00:51:43,611
When things are at their darkest, pal...

547
00:51:43,701 --> 00:51:46,499
...it's a brave man
who can kick back and party.

548
00:51:47,221 --> 00:51:50,133
Jack, let the good times roll.

549
00:52:57,821 --> 00:53:01,939
-I didn't know dancing was so much fun.
-You ought to try it with a girl sometime.

550
00:53:03,261 --> 00:53:04,819
Someone like this?

551
00:53:07,301 --> 00:53:08,290
Yeah.

552
00:53:09,941 --> 00:53:11,374
Somebody like that.

553
00:53:11,541 --> 00:53:12,974
You know what's weird?

554
00:53:13,061 --> 00:53:16,258
You are seeing parts of my body...

555
00:53:17,021 --> 00:53:19,455
...that I will never get to see.

556
00:53:19,701 --> 00:53:22,261
Believe me,
you're not missing all that much.

557
00:53:22,981 --> 00:53:24,619
The gastric mucosa.

558
00:53:26,421 --> 00:53:30,494
Intestinal villi. Pulmonary alveoli.

559
00:53:32,501 --> 00:53:34,332
Faraway places with...

560
00:53:35,221 --> 00:53:38,099
...strange-sounding names.

561
00:53:38,261 --> 00:53:39,933
Hey, Jack. Jack!

562
00:53:40,541 --> 00:53:44,580
-Go to the mirror in the bedroom, will you?
-Why?

563
00:53:45,141 --> 00:53:48,178
I don't know what you look like
from the outside.

564
00:53:49,101 --> 00:53:50,090
Sure.

565
00:53:55,221 --> 00:53:56,495
Are you drunk?

566
00:53:56,581 --> 00:53:59,778
I got up a little too fast,
so I was just a little dizzy.

567
00:53:59,861 --> 00:54:01,260
Yeah, right.

568
00:54:02,341 --> 00:54:03,933
-Is that you?
-Yeah, that's me.

569
00:54:04,021 --> 00:54:06,057
-Look at you.
-Yeah, look at me.

570
00:54:06,261 --> 00:54:08,138
Go to the mirror. Come on.

571
00:54:10,701 --> 00:54:12,578
-How's this?
-A little too close, Jack.

572
00:54:12,781 --> 00:54:15,090
Too close? How is this? ls this good?

573
00:54:15,701 --> 00:54:18,852
You know what,
we're going to need a lot more help.

574
00:54:20,261 --> 00:54:23,697
-Can you drive? ls your head clear?
-Yes, yes.

575
00:54:24,341 --> 00:54:26,059
Slap yourself in the face.

576
00:54:27,061 --> 00:54:29,052
-What?
-Your face. Slap it.

577
00:54:32,256 --> 00:54:33,371
Harder!

578
00:54:34,496 --> 00:54:35,770
Again!

579
00:54:37,056 --> 00:54:39,854
-Sober yet?
-One more time.

580
00:54:41,376 --> 00:54:44,413
-How does it feel?
-It feels good.

581
00:54:44,896 --> 00:54:47,535
The Jack Putter machine, zero defects.

582
00:54:52,096 --> 00:54:53,529
God help us.

583
00:54:54,496 --> 00:54:56,885
"Espionage in Silicon Valley.

584
00:54:57,096 --> 00:54:59,815
"The buying and selling
of advanced technology."

585
00:55:00,016 --> 00:55:02,814
It sounded like Sunday supplement stuff
to me then...

586
00:55:02,976 --> 00:55:04,967
...and that's how it sounds to me now.

587
00:55:05,856 --> 00:55:08,245
Will you look at me
when I'm talking to you?

588
00:55:08,376 --> 00:55:11,891
When people get murdered,
that's when we'll print it in Metro.

589
00:55:12,096 --> 00:55:14,166
Harry, people are getting murdered.

590
00:55:15,816 --> 00:55:19,172
A scientist named Ozzie Wexler
was killed today in a shopping mall.

591
00:55:19,256 --> 00:55:21,816
-Nobody saw who did it.
-What do you know about him?

592
00:55:21,896 --> 00:55:25,571
More than the police. He worked for a lab
called Vector-Scope near the mall.

593
00:55:25,776 --> 00:55:27,528
Something gets stolen maybe?

594
00:55:27,616 --> 00:55:30,210
I don't know. The lab's locked up tight.
Why?

595
00:55:30,936 --> 00:55:33,325
-The Cowboy.
-Who's the Cowboy?

596
00:55:33,416 --> 00:55:34,974
-Is he here now?
-On his way.

597
00:55:35,056 --> 00:55:39,049
TWA flight 607,
arriving San Francisco at 4:00 p.m.

598
00:55:39,176 --> 00:55:41,371
Will you talk to me?
What am l, chopped liver?

599
00:55:41,456 --> 00:55:42,605
Who's the Cowboy?

600
00:56:03,936 --> 00:56:07,133
I'm sorry, sir,
you'll have to extinguish that cigar.

601
00:56:19,696 --> 00:56:24,292
There is nothing like a good cigar.
Eh, partner?

602
00:56:41,656 --> 00:56:43,567
-Hey, there she is!
-Where?

603
00:56:44,136 --> 00:56:46,411
I saw her out of the corner of your eye.

604
00:56:46,576 --> 00:56:49,170
Honk the horn! Honk the horn!

605
00:56:53,056 --> 00:56:54,171
Pull over!

606
00:56:56,456 --> 00:56:57,889
-You see her?
-Yeah.

607
00:56:59,296 --> 00:57:01,252
What do you think you're doing?

608
00:57:01,536 --> 00:57:04,926
Does Tuck Pendelton know
you have his car? No!

609
00:57:05,016 --> 00:57:07,576
He'd sooner trust you
with his life than with his car.

610
00:57:07,656 --> 00:57:08,930
Here we go.

611
00:57:10,456 --> 00:57:13,095
You're wearing Tuck's jacket. Why?

612
00:57:13,176 --> 00:57:16,213
-Lydia, shut up and listen.
-Lydia, shut up and listen.

613
00:57:17,456 --> 00:57:18,889
You said that good.

614
00:57:22,496 --> 00:57:24,805
Tuck's in trouble. He needs your help.

615
00:57:26,056 --> 00:57:28,934
Tuck is being held for ransom.

616
00:57:30,496 --> 00:57:32,885
In a manner of speaking, yes.

617
00:57:33,896 --> 00:57:37,172
We need a certain microchip
to get him back.

618
00:57:37,256 --> 00:57:40,612
Unfortunately it was taken
from Vector-Scope labs this morning.

619
00:57:40,696 --> 00:57:43,415
So there was a break-in! How did Tuck....

620
00:57:44,816 --> 00:57:47,489
-How did you get involved in this?
-Me?

621
00:57:48,096 --> 00:57:51,213
-It's a long story.
-Good. Reporters love long stories.

622
00:57:54,496 --> 00:57:57,090
Don't let her take control
over the conversation.

623
00:57:57,176 --> 00:58:00,532
Be aggressive. Dominate her.
Don't be a wuss-puss. Be me.

624
00:58:05,016 --> 00:58:08,565
Look, Lydia,
you're just going to have to trust me.

625
00:58:09,296 --> 00:58:12,652
There's no time to explain.
We only have until 9:00 a.m. tomorrow.

626
00:58:12,776 --> 00:58:13,765
That's good.

627
00:58:13,856 --> 00:58:16,928
9:00 tomorrow morning?
Can't we negotiate for more time?

628
00:58:17,016 --> 00:58:18,085
No, we--

629
00:58:18,176 --> 00:58:20,246
Where is he? Where are they keeping him?

630
00:58:20,336 --> 00:58:21,325
Where?

631
00:58:23,296 --> 00:58:24,411
Close by.

632
00:58:24,616 --> 00:58:28,894
In the area.
In the immediate area, vicinity.

633
00:58:29,096 --> 00:58:31,371
-It's difficult to know--
-Who has him?

634
00:58:33,176 --> 00:58:36,851
Would you excuse me for a second?
I'll be right back.

635
00:58:40,936 --> 00:58:42,767
I blew it. I can't handle her.

636
00:58:42,856 --> 00:58:45,734
No. You didn't do so bad.
She's a tough cookie.

637
00:58:45,816 --> 00:58:49,013
She's a beautiful tough cookie.
You're a lucky guy.

638
00:58:49,296 --> 00:58:52,254
-What's that supposed to mean?
-Nothing. I just hate this.

639
00:58:52,336 --> 00:58:55,567
Why can't we tell her the truth?
She might even believe us.

640
00:58:56,416 --> 00:59:00,329
-Besides, it's humiliating being this small.
-What's so bad about being small?

641
00:59:00,776 --> 00:59:02,732
You won't be small forever.

642
00:59:03,176 --> 00:59:05,565
Play with it, pal, but don't talk to it.

643
00:59:05,856 --> 00:59:07,130
Who was that?

644
00:59:07,936 --> 00:59:09,085
Never mind.

645
00:59:10,976 --> 00:59:13,774
-Tuck!
-Yeah?

646
00:59:14,416 --> 00:59:15,326
Just checking.

647
00:59:25,856 --> 00:59:27,175
Hold it.

648
00:59:28,016 --> 00:59:32,851
This is a Taser gun,
deploying a charge of 20,000 volts.

649
00:59:33,376 --> 00:59:37,210
It will immobilize you for 15 minutes
and in all probability...

650
00:59:37,296 --> 00:59:41,175
...will render you unconscious as well.
So I would let go of that man!

651
00:59:42,816 --> 00:59:44,010
No!

652
00:59:44,936 --> 00:59:46,813
Electrical system overload!

653
00:59:53,016 --> 00:59:54,688
Somebody call the police!

654
00:59:55,736 --> 00:59:56,725
Jack.

655
00:59:57,816 --> 01:00:00,011
Are you all right?
We had a massive power surge.

656
01:00:33,216 --> 01:00:36,652
Jack, what is going on?
Your heart rate's way down. Talk to me.

657
01:00:37,416 --> 01:00:39,008
I'm....

658
01:00:40,216 --> 01:00:41,205
Jack?

659
01:00:41,736 --> 01:00:44,296
You had me worried.
I thought I'd lost you.

660
01:00:44,496 --> 01:00:46,327
Where are we, a meat locker?

661
01:00:48,416 --> 01:00:50,372
-I'm freezing.
-You're freezing?

662
01:00:53,096 --> 01:00:55,815
Jack, what is that loud clicking sound?

663
01:01:18,376 --> 01:01:19,968
Mr. Scrimshaw?

664
01:01:35,936 --> 01:01:38,052
Who are these people? Where are we?

665
01:01:38,216 --> 01:01:39,092
Jack?

666
01:01:46,656 --> 01:01:48,294
Dr. Canker, get in here!

667
01:01:54,096 --> 01:01:55,449
This is a doctor?

668
01:02:01,216 --> 01:02:02,092
Well?

669
01:02:03,536 --> 01:02:04,969
Mild hypothermia.

670
01:02:05,416 --> 01:02:06,769
We need him alive.

671
01:02:08,096 --> 01:02:10,485
Oh, yes. He should be alive.

672
01:02:11,336 --> 01:02:12,564
Bring a blanket.

673
01:02:12,656 --> 01:02:14,294
Let me take care of him.

674
01:02:15,496 --> 01:02:17,248
I know how to warm him up.

675
01:02:19,256 --> 01:02:22,566
Knock it off, Margaret.
You're riding in the Subzero.

676
01:02:23,096 --> 01:02:24,165
Very well.

677
01:02:28,656 --> 01:02:32,205
-Aren't you riding in the limo?
-No, go ahead.

678
01:02:32,896 --> 01:02:37,208
I'm staying back here with my friend Jack.

679
01:02:54,016 --> 01:02:55,768
Nuclear weapons, Jack.

680
01:02:57,856 --> 01:03:00,450
They mean nothing. Everybody's got them.

681
01:03:00,896 --> 01:03:03,968
Nobody has the balls to use them.
Am I right?

682
01:03:06,016 --> 01:03:08,655
"Space," you say. Space is a flop.

683
01:03:09,376 --> 01:03:10,809
Didn't you know that?

684
01:03:10,896 --> 01:03:14,093
An endless junkyard of orbiting debris.

685
01:03:14,976 --> 01:03:16,204
But...

686
01:03:17,176 --> 01:03:19,087
...miniaturization, Jack!

687
01:03:19,656 --> 01:03:23,888
That's the ticket. That's the edge
that everybody's been looking for.

688
01:03:24,136 --> 01:03:26,047
Who will have that edge, Jack?

689
01:03:26,856 --> 01:03:30,087
What country will control miniaturization?

690
01:03:33,016 --> 01:03:37,055
Frankly, I don't give a shit.
I'm only in this for the money.

691
01:03:37,456 --> 01:03:41,495
And that's why
we've got to get that little pod...

692
01:03:41,616 --> 01:03:43,652
...out from inside of you!

693
01:03:46,016 --> 01:03:48,814
This guy is definitely not operating
on all eight cylinders.

694
01:03:54,336 --> 01:03:57,055
Jack, sitting here, freezing as we are...

695
01:03:57,376 --> 01:04:01,892
...l'm reminded of the year I spent
working in the Alaskan goldfields.

696
01:04:02,416 --> 01:04:05,772
Glance around slowly
so I can get a lay of the land.

697
01:04:06,056 --> 01:04:07,853
-I was a young man then...
-Come on.

698
01:04:07,936 --> 01:04:10,609
...much younger than yourself,
but twice as big.

699
01:04:10,896 --> 01:04:12,966
Hold up. Wait. Go back to the doors.

700
01:04:13,656 --> 01:04:15,328
Those were memorable times.

701
01:04:15,416 --> 01:04:19,489
Okay, Jack.
This is it. The doors are unlocked.

702
01:04:19,776 --> 01:04:23,530
This is your moment.
It all comes down to this.

703
01:04:24,016 --> 01:04:26,576
You're not the same man
you were this morning.

704
01:04:26,896 --> 01:04:30,366
You're better, stronger.
You're a man in control of your destiny!

705
01:04:30,536 --> 01:04:31,810
Psych yourself up.

706
01:04:31,896 --> 01:04:34,012
See yourself opening the doors, Jack...

707
01:04:34,136 --> 01:04:38,368
...and jumping from the truck.
You aren't bagging groceries all your life.

708
01:04:38,576 --> 01:04:41,932
See yourselfbeing a hero!
Psych yourself up!

709
01:04:45,696 --> 01:04:48,210
Can you do it, Jack? Can you see it, Jack?

710
01:04:49,376 --> 01:04:51,287
Yes! I can see it!

711
01:04:51,736 --> 01:04:54,170
Not yet! Wait until it stops.

712
01:04:55,936 --> 01:04:57,688
Come back here, you fool!

713
01:05:00,376 --> 01:05:01,365
Jack!

714
01:05:05,896 --> 01:05:07,727
Do you see that truck?

715
01:05:11,936 --> 01:05:13,847
Come in here, you Safeway clerk!

716
01:05:20,376 --> 01:05:21,695
You're scaring me, Jack.

717
01:05:36,376 --> 01:05:38,332
Don't be a putz, get in here!

718
01:05:44,256 --> 01:05:45,371
It's Lydia!

719
01:05:45,496 --> 01:05:47,726
We're going to jump in the car, Jack.

720
01:05:48,416 --> 01:05:51,135
Come on, buddy! Come on!

721
01:05:51,536 --> 01:05:52,525
Wait!

722
01:05:54,296 --> 01:05:56,366
Igoe! Stop the truck!

723
01:05:59,616 --> 01:06:00,731
Get closer!

724
01:06:02,256 --> 01:06:03,484
Jack!

725
01:06:04,696 --> 01:06:06,254
What are you doing?

726
01:06:07,256 --> 01:06:09,645
-What do you think I'm doing?
-Get in the car!

727
01:06:09,736 --> 01:06:11,613
I'm trying to get in the car!

728
01:06:27,656 --> 01:06:29,965
Jump in the car, Jack!

729
01:06:30,176 --> 01:06:31,768
You can do it!

730
01:06:41,496 --> 01:06:42,849
Jack, I love you!

731
01:06:43,016 --> 01:06:44,734
Way to go, Jack!

732
01:06:48,296 --> 01:06:49,934
What exactly are we doing here?

733
01:06:50,016 --> 01:06:51,495
Waiting for someone.

734
01:06:54,016 --> 01:06:55,654
Who are we waiting for?

735
01:06:55,936 --> 01:06:57,369
The Cowboy.

736
01:06:58,416 --> 01:07:00,407
I've tracked his movements for months.

737
01:07:00,496 --> 01:07:04,011
He got to the airport about an hour ago,
and he always stays here.

738
01:07:04,096 --> 01:07:06,087
I think he'll lead us to that chip.

739
01:07:06,416 --> 01:07:08,054
Hey, knock it off!

740
01:07:09,456 --> 01:07:10,809
Why do you think that?

741
01:07:10,936 --> 01:07:12,255
He's a fence.

742
01:07:12,456 --> 01:07:15,812
He deals in stolen Western technology
almost exclusively...

743
01:07:15,936 --> 01:07:18,973
...which he then sells overseas
to the highest bidder.

744
01:07:19,616 --> 01:07:22,494
Who do you think introduced Velcro
to the Persian Gulf?.

745
01:07:22,576 --> 01:07:24,009
Really?

746
01:07:27,416 --> 01:07:30,328
There he is, perfect timing.
We're checking in.

747
01:07:30,816 --> 01:07:35,287
I'll get the suitcase out of the trunk.
It's less suspicious with a suitcase.

748
01:07:37,576 --> 01:07:39,453
How did you know this was here?

749
01:07:39,536 --> 01:07:41,686
Tuck keeps a packed suitcase
in the trunk...

750
01:07:41,776 --> 01:07:44,244
...in case he wakes up in a strange place.

751
01:07:45,696 --> 01:07:48,893
Oh, no. She knows about the suitcase.

752
01:07:49,896 --> 01:07:51,011
Margaret...

753
01:07:51,136 --> 01:07:54,890
...the Cowboy is in town
and we don't have that other chip.

754
01:07:55,296 --> 01:07:59,608
I'm awfully busy right now, Victor.
I'll have to call you back.

755
01:08:00,336 --> 01:08:02,088
Just get me that chip!

756
01:08:25,216 --> 01:08:26,968
"I'm an old cowhand

757
01:08:27,536 --> 01:08:29,094
"from the Rio Grande

758
01:08:29,936 --> 01:08:31,847
"But my leg's not bowed

759
01:08:32,776 --> 01:08:34,528
"And my face not tan

760
01:08:36,016 --> 01:08:39,008
"I'm a cowboy who's never seen that cow

761
01:08:39,816 --> 01:08:42,410
"Can't rope a steer
'cause I don't know how

762
01:08:42,496 --> 01:08:45,374
"And I'm not going to start learning how"

763
01:08:49,696 --> 01:08:53,894
I tipped the desk clerk $100 for this room
so we could hear his every move.

764
01:08:54,216 --> 01:08:56,127
When he leaves, we go too.

765
01:08:56,376 --> 01:08:57,650
What if he stays in?

766
01:08:57,736 --> 01:09:01,490
He won't. He loves a club called lnferno.
The man does not sleep.

767
01:09:02,296 --> 01:09:04,764
The guy in the truck
said his name was Scrimshaw?

768
01:09:04,896 --> 01:09:08,571
What are you looking at?
I thought you were a gentleman.

769
01:09:08,936 --> 01:09:11,131
Come on, Tuck, what do you expect?

770
01:09:12,736 --> 01:09:16,524
She has the cutest little overbite,
don't you think?

771
01:09:17,776 --> 01:09:21,564
It gives her mouth this adorable,
pouty expression! So sweet!

772
01:09:21,656 --> 01:09:23,328
I know what she looks like.

773
01:09:23,416 --> 01:09:25,930
What is the deal
between you two, anyway?

774
01:09:26,096 --> 01:09:27,973
It's none of your business.

775
01:09:28,616 --> 01:09:32,848
Tuck, I need a change of clothes.
Mind if I dip into your suitcase?

776
01:09:33,616 --> 01:09:36,574
Dip all you like, nothing's going to fit you.

777
01:09:37,536 --> 01:09:40,892
Legal counsel
to reputed organized crime figures.

778
01:09:41,136 --> 01:09:44,094
Administrator of four
Teamster pension funds...

779
01:09:44,336 --> 01:09:46,850
...suspected of black market arms dealing...

780
01:09:47,016 --> 01:09:49,610
...yet somehow
he always keeps his nose clean.

781
01:09:51,336 --> 01:09:52,530
Anything else?

782
01:09:53,376 --> 01:09:57,813
They say he has Jimmy Hoffa's wristwatch
in his desk drawer as a souvenir.

783
01:10:04,696 --> 01:10:07,005
Oxygen reserve at 60 percent.

784
01:10:11,376 --> 01:10:12,570
We be cool.

785
01:10:13,296 --> 01:10:14,854
Jack, Scrimshaw is....

786
01:10:17,176 --> 01:10:18,370
How do I look?

787
01:10:21,896 --> 01:10:23,295
What's the matter?

788
01:10:24,616 --> 01:10:25,605
Nothing.

789
01:10:27,376 --> 01:10:29,332
You just remind me of a time...

790
01:10:30,176 --> 01:10:32,132
...when Tuck wore this jacket.

791
01:10:35,216 --> 01:10:37,127
It was the night we first met.

792
01:10:38,056 --> 01:10:40,047
You were doing that article about me...

793
01:10:41,016 --> 01:10:43,530
...we had dinner and talked until 3:00 a.m.

794
01:10:44,416 --> 01:10:48,409
I got drunk and threw up, and fell
down a manhole walking you home.

795
01:10:49,456 --> 01:10:52,129
It looks like you're pretty hung up
on the guy.

796
01:10:56,176 --> 01:10:58,053
How well do you know Tuck?

797
01:10:59,176 --> 01:11:01,929
Well, we're very close, actually.

798
01:11:03,136 --> 01:11:04,569
Does he...

799
01:11:05,416 --> 01:11:06,769
...talk about me?

800
01:11:10,056 --> 01:11:15,176
I find that Tuck tends to be
a little tight-lipped about women.

801
01:11:15,296 --> 01:11:16,809
Will you knock it off!

802
01:11:18,216 --> 01:11:21,731
If I were Tuck,
I'd talk about you all the time.

803
01:11:22,936 --> 01:11:24,847
Yeah. Right.

804
01:11:25,136 --> 01:11:26,649
The Cowboy is leaving.

805
01:11:53,576 --> 01:11:55,168
I think I need a ticket.

806
01:12:00,336 --> 01:12:01,530
Jack?

807
01:12:04,136 --> 01:12:05,012
Jack!

808
01:12:05,216 --> 01:12:07,366
It's Wendy! My God, Jack!

809
01:12:07,736 --> 01:12:10,204
-Look at you.
-Well, look at you.

810
01:12:10,296 --> 01:12:12,252
I'm going in before we lose him.

811
01:12:12,496 --> 01:12:14,487
-I'm with him!
-She's with me.

812
01:12:51,776 --> 01:12:52,925
Hey, Cowboy.

813
01:13:33,216 --> 01:13:35,013
I can't believe it, Jack!

814
01:13:35,936 --> 01:13:37,847
This is so exciting!

815
01:13:38,096 --> 01:13:40,929
How long have you led this double life?

816
01:13:41,536 --> 01:13:43,447
Oh, for a while now.

817
01:13:48,816 --> 01:13:50,568
Women love me.

818
01:13:51,616 --> 01:13:53,208
But you know that.

819
01:13:54,376 --> 01:13:57,413
But for serious,
two things you want to know about me:

820
01:13:58,216 --> 01:14:01,253
One, I make love with my boots on.

821
01:14:02,096 --> 01:14:03,165
And two....

822
01:14:08,896 --> 01:14:12,935
I know I've been mean to you, Jack.
I can be such a shit sometimes.

823
01:14:14,496 --> 01:14:16,054
It doesn't really matter.

824
01:14:16,136 --> 01:14:19,253
It's probably on account of my life sucking
the way it does.

825
01:14:19,416 --> 01:14:21,327
I'm a complete mess, you know.

826
01:14:23,176 --> 01:14:24,529
-You know?
-Yeah.

827
01:14:26,336 --> 01:14:30,045
You're probably the only person
at the supermarket I haven't slept with.

828
01:14:31,216 --> 01:14:34,652
And you're the only person
I'm even partially attracted to.

829
01:14:36,136 --> 01:14:37,410
Thank you.

830
01:14:38,696 --> 01:14:40,732
That lady is signaling you.

831
01:14:46,616 --> 01:14:49,892
I came with her,
I should find out what she wants.

832
01:14:56,576 --> 01:14:58,009
I found out something.

833
01:14:58,096 --> 01:15:02,567
The Cowboy is meeting with Scrimshaw,
they're picking him up at the hotel.

834
01:15:02,736 --> 01:15:05,204
They're going to give him the microchip.

835
01:15:08,256 --> 01:15:09,245
Cowboy.

836
01:15:09,976 --> 01:15:11,170
This is Jack.

837
01:15:11,656 --> 01:15:13,692
-Hi, Cowboy.
-Howdy, Big Jack.

838
01:15:15,576 --> 01:15:20,366
Let's go, Buffalo Gal.
Let's split this nowhere scene.

839
01:15:20,656 --> 01:15:23,045
He's taking me to the hotel. Follow us.

840
01:15:27,576 --> 01:15:28,565
Wendy?

841
01:15:30,176 --> 01:15:32,690
-I'm sorry, I gotta go.
-Call me later?

842
01:15:40,496 --> 01:15:41,531
Hurry up!

843
01:15:41,616 --> 01:15:43,208
I am hurrying up, okay?

844
01:15:43,616 --> 01:15:46,335
I don't want her alone
with that sleazy Cowboy either.

845
01:15:46,416 --> 01:15:47,769
Yeah, why not?

846
01:15:48,056 --> 01:15:49,808
Because I just don't, that's why.

847
01:15:50,736 --> 01:15:53,773
God, I can't believe how hostile I feel
towards you right now.

848
01:15:54,176 --> 01:15:56,690
Because I'm stimulating
your adrenal gland, pal.

849
01:15:56,776 --> 01:15:58,732
Maybe that's the reason and maybe not.

850
01:15:58,816 --> 01:16:01,376
You got something to say, just say it.

851
01:16:01,616 --> 01:16:03,493
She deserves better. That's all.

852
01:16:03,656 --> 01:16:05,612
-Better than what?
-Better than you.

853
01:16:05,936 --> 01:16:06,846
I knew it!

854
01:16:06,976 --> 01:16:09,285
You think she goes for you, don't you?

855
01:16:09,376 --> 01:16:11,606
You know what she sees in you?
She sees me.

856
01:16:11,936 --> 01:16:14,894
All right, Pendelton, that's it.
Where are you?

857
01:16:15,256 --> 01:16:17,053
Where are you, you little weasel?

858
01:16:17,216 --> 01:16:18,968
Save it for the Cowboy.

859
01:16:26,096 --> 01:16:27,211
Wrong door!

860
01:16:28,656 --> 01:16:31,250
That's an exit, Jack. Come on, control it.

861
01:16:31,576 --> 01:16:34,329
You're a dangerous individual.
You can do it!

862
01:16:36,936 --> 01:16:38,210
Big Jack!

863
01:16:38,656 --> 01:16:40,487
Don't knock, just come!

864
01:16:40,576 --> 01:16:41,975
Duke the son of a bitch!

865
01:16:44,456 --> 01:16:45,445
Jack?

866
01:16:47,216 --> 01:16:49,810
-Where were you?
-Next door waiting for you.

867
01:16:50,016 --> 01:16:51,972
Beauty punch anyway, Big Jack.

868
01:16:52,896 --> 01:16:56,491
Now tie that sucker tight,
he's gonna squirm when he wakes up.

869
01:16:57,136 --> 01:16:59,730
There, now look at the Cowboy.

870
01:17:02,576 --> 01:17:04,055
Hold it right there.

871
01:17:05,856 --> 01:17:08,245
Emulation systems activated.

872
01:17:08,736 --> 01:17:10,727
Contour analysis, stage one.

873
01:17:11,256 --> 01:17:13,212
Move over, Picasso. Look at this.

874
01:17:13,296 --> 01:17:15,207
Grid mapping ectodermal contours.

875
01:17:15,576 --> 01:17:16,929
Go to the mirror.

876
01:17:18,336 --> 01:17:19,485
What'll we do?

877
01:17:19,576 --> 01:17:22,727
I'll attempt an electronic stimulation
of your nerves and muscles.

878
01:17:22,816 --> 01:17:23,726
What's that?

879
01:17:23,816 --> 01:17:26,125
-I'm going to alter your face.
-Alter my face?

880
01:17:26,336 --> 01:17:27,769
How do you do that?

881
01:17:29,456 --> 01:17:33,688
It's complicated.
I don't understand it myself. Just trust me.

882
01:17:33,776 --> 01:17:34,970
Will it hurt?

883
01:17:36,456 --> 01:17:37,286
Yeah.

884
01:17:37,376 --> 01:17:38,934
Let's not do it then.

885
01:17:42,496 --> 01:17:44,327
What are you doing in there?

886
01:17:47,456 --> 01:17:48,650
Are you okay?

887
01:17:48,736 --> 01:17:50,089
We're getting there.

888
01:17:50,176 --> 01:17:53,054
Hang on. This might pinch just a little bit.

889
01:18:00,376 --> 01:18:01,365
Jack?

890
01:18:02,056 --> 01:18:04,172
Is that a "5" or a "6"?

891
01:18:04,976 --> 01:18:06,534
I'm right, it's "5."

892
01:18:15,736 --> 01:18:16,725
What?

893
01:18:16,816 --> 01:18:18,488
What did you do to him?

894
01:18:18,696 --> 01:18:19,890
-Who?
-Jack!

895
01:18:19,976 --> 01:18:21,045
Jack?

896
01:18:21,176 --> 01:18:23,087
Get away from me!

897
01:18:23,336 --> 01:18:26,646
I'm Jack. Listen to my voice. It's me.

898
01:18:26,976 --> 01:18:28,409
Then who's in the bathroom?

899
01:18:28,496 --> 01:18:30,293
-He is.
-Who is?

900
01:18:30,376 --> 01:18:31,650
-Him.
-Who?

901
01:18:31,736 --> 01:18:32,851
The Cowboy.

902
01:18:33,376 --> 01:18:35,731
I know it's hard to understand.

903
01:18:35,856 --> 01:18:39,405
It's hard for me to understand.
But you must believe and trust me.

904
01:18:41,216 --> 01:18:42,410
I can explain later--

905
01:18:42,496 --> 01:18:45,966
-How did you get Jack's hair?
-I'm not too sure about that one.

906
01:18:47,896 --> 01:18:49,249
Go see for yourself.

907
01:18:49,336 --> 01:18:52,851
I will go in and see for myself.
I'm not stupid.

908
01:19:04,376 --> 01:19:06,207
-Jack?
-My God.

909
01:19:09,456 --> 01:19:10,730
How?

910
01:19:17,376 --> 01:19:19,526
Don't ask, okay?

911
01:19:19,936 --> 01:19:21,688
Just trust me.

912
01:19:22,096 --> 01:19:25,213
I'll explain everything, I promise,
but not right now.

913
01:19:27,216 --> 01:19:28,490
I'll go with you.

914
01:19:28,576 --> 01:19:30,328
Don't let her. It's not safe.

915
01:19:30,416 --> 01:19:32,088
Better not, Lydia.

916
01:19:32,536 --> 01:19:36,006
Tuck used to say he did the things
I only write about.

917
01:19:36,336 --> 01:19:38,645
I want to do the things I only write about.

918
01:19:38,896 --> 01:19:40,215
Open your mouth.

919
01:19:49,976 --> 01:19:50,931
Men.

920
01:19:51,136 --> 01:19:52,694
Mr. Scrimshaw is waiting.

921
01:19:56,016 --> 01:19:58,291
What do you say?

922
01:19:58,656 --> 01:20:00,692
Never beg. Never beg!

923
01:20:20,616 --> 01:20:21,844
Hello, Cowboy.

924
01:20:22,056 --> 01:20:25,287
Welcome. Sit down. Join us.

925
01:20:25,736 --> 01:20:28,011
My friend, we have been waiting for you.

926
01:20:28,096 --> 01:20:29,848
-Are we close friends?
-I hope not.

927
01:20:29,936 --> 01:20:31,847
How long has it been, Cowboy?

928
01:20:32,336 --> 01:20:35,055
-You tell me.
-Almost six years.

929
01:20:35,976 --> 01:20:37,091
Don't you remember?

930
01:20:37,176 --> 01:20:38,689
Idi Amin's barbecue.

931
01:20:40,456 --> 01:20:42,447
How could I forgot? The sauce.

932
01:20:42,696 --> 01:20:46,052
You haven't forgotten the last time
we saw each other, have you?

933
01:20:46,896 --> 01:20:49,126
Speaking of which,
we seem to have a rather...

934
01:20:49,456 --> 01:20:51,845
...attractive added starter this morning.

935
01:20:51,936 --> 01:20:54,245
Yes, my sister.

936
01:20:55,176 --> 01:20:56,211
In-law.

937
01:20:56,976 --> 01:20:59,092
Good morning, sister-in-law.

938
01:20:59,896 --> 01:21:00,885
Murnau...

939
01:21:01,376 --> 01:21:03,412
...another place setting, please.

940
01:21:03,776 --> 01:21:06,609
I don't know what it is,
but there's something about you.

941
01:21:08,736 --> 01:21:11,296
You've changed, you're different.

942
01:21:13,696 --> 01:21:15,687
-I've been sick.
-Good thinking, Jack.

943
01:21:15,776 --> 01:21:16,891
Champagne?

944
01:21:17,856 --> 01:21:19,448
Please, join me.

945
01:21:20,096 --> 01:21:23,088
I believe these are the kind you like.
Cuban?

946
01:21:23,736 --> 01:21:24,612
Cuban?

947
01:21:24,816 --> 01:21:27,250
Jack, you're in luck, Cuban are the best.

948
01:21:29,456 --> 01:21:30,969
I save this for later.

949
01:21:35,576 --> 01:21:36,565
Jack!

950
01:21:37,216 --> 01:21:38,205
Cowboy...

951
01:21:38,896 --> 01:21:40,807
...what has happened to your hair?

952
01:21:44,816 --> 01:21:46,408
I had it done.

953
01:21:46,736 --> 01:21:50,411
Clint Eastwood style.
You see The Outlaw Josey Wales?

954
01:21:50,496 --> 01:21:51,485
What a flick.

955
01:21:51,616 --> 01:21:54,335
Enough pleasantries.
Let's get down to business.

956
01:21:54,816 --> 01:21:55,931
Dr. Canker.

957
01:21:58,096 --> 01:22:00,815
Miniaturization works
on a dual-chip system.

958
01:22:01,296 --> 01:22:02,968
Don't play with your food.

959
01:22:03,056 --> 01:22:06,253
We have one in our possession now,
and we'll have the other one...

960
01:22:06,576 --> 01:22:07,725
...very soon.

961
01:22:08,336 --> 01:22:09,610
Take what they got.

962
01:22:09,696 --> 01:22:11,652
Fine. I'll take what you got.

963
01:22:13,056 --> 01:22:14,535
You do understand...

964
01:22:14,696 --> 01:22:18,530
...the first chip only miniaturizes.
Both are required...

965
01:22:18,896 --> 01:22:20,534
...for re-enlargement.

966
01:22:21,416 --> 01:22:23,976
We whet their appetites with what we got.

967
01:22:24,496 --> 01:22:25,975
-Good point, Cowboy.
-Thank you.

968
01:22:26,056 --> 01:22:27,933
-Good point, Jack.
-Thank you.

969
01:22:29,336 --> 01:22:31,054
Doctor. The chip, please.

970
01:22:35,376 --> 01:22:36,604
Easy.

971
01:22:37,456 --> 01:22:39,048
There it is.

972
01:22:40,656 --> 01:22:44,490
Hang on, Jack.
Now, I want you to reach out...

973
01:22:45,536 --> 01:22:47,094
...and put it in your pocket.

974
01:22:49,136 --> 01:22:51,525
It's so tiny. Who would think?

975
01:22:55,056 --> 01:22:56,967
Jack, what are you doing?

976
01:22:57,296 --> 01:22:59,252
Take the chip. Don't freeze up on me.

977
01:23:03,256 --> 01:23:07,613
Miss, has the Cowboy ever told you
of his incredible tolerance for pain?

978
01:23:08,096 --> 01:23:09,814
His what?

979
01:23:10,416 --> 01:23:12,486
His ability to withstand pain.

980
01:23:14,056 --> 01:23:15,853
His stoicism is legendary.

981
01:23:16,336 --> 01:23:18,566
Hiding your light under a bushel?

982
01:23:18,736 --> 01:23:20,169
How unlike you.

983
01:23:20,336 --> 01:23:22,088
If that is who you are.

984
01:23:23,376 --> 01:23:26,209
You mind satisfying my curiosity
on that point?

985
01:23:26,456 --> 01:23:30,290
In lieu of champagne,
how about some real pain?

986
01:23:30,816 --> 01:23:32,215
Propane?

987
01:23:41,456 --> 01:23:43,811
Warning: Adrenalin level overload.

988
01:23:43,936 --> 01:23:46,245
You all right, Jack?

989
01:23:49,696 --> 01:23:50,685
No!

990
01:23:50,776 --> 01:23:52,129
Don't worry, Cowboy...

991
01:23:52,216 --> 01:23:55,128
...Dr. Canker has pioneered the field
of limb replacement.

992
01:23:55,216 --> 01:23:57,207
You're generating
too much electrical energy.

993
01:23:57,296 --> 01:23:58,285
I can't hold the balance.

994
01:23:59,136 --> 01:24:00,649
Stay calm, Jack!

995
01:24:04,376 --> 01:24:07,573
Cowboy, stop it. Don't do that.
I was just kidding.

996
01:24:11,936 --> 01:24:13,449
Please, no more.

997
01:24:13,696 --> 01:24:14,970
It was a joke.

998
01:24:20,496 --> 01:24:22,407
I'm begging you. Stop it.

999
01:24:22,656 --> 01:24:23,930
How you doing, Jack?

1000
01:24:25,856 --> 01:24:28,086
God in heaven, deliver us from Satan.

1001
01:24:37,816 --> 01:24:40,376
It's him. It's Putter.

1002
01:24:42,096 --> 01:24:43,085
Get him!

1003
01:24:58,776 --> 01:25:00,255
Did you swallow it?

1004
01:25:02,016 --> 01:25:04,052
Give it to me. Give it to me.

1005
01:25:09,416 --> 01:25:11,008
You've found it.

1006
01:25:15,176 --> 01:25:18,646
Don't kill him. Lock him up. The girl, too.

1007
01:25:26,216 --> 01:25:28,446
Great. I'm going to get tetanus now.

1008
01:25:30,016 --> 01:25:31,654
We got to get out of here.

1009
01:25:38,896 --> 01:25:40,887
-Are you going to help?
-No.

1010
01:25:41,256 --> 01:25:42,245
What?

1011
01:25:42,336 --> 01:25:45,851
Not until you tell me what is going on!

1012
01:25:46,256 --> 01:25:48,326
I want to know everything.

1013
01:25:48,496 --> 01:25:50,612
You might as well tell her.

1014
01:25:51,616 --> 01:25:53,811
-Really?
-Yes, really.

1015
01:25:57,536 --> 01:26:00,334
They're preparing the lab now.
Igoe's already on his way.

1016
01:26:00,536 --> 01:26:01,525
Good.

1017
01:26:04,296 --> 01:26:05,888
I don't think she believes me.

1018
01:26:05,976 --> 01:26:08,285
The way you tell it, I wouldn't either.

1019
01:26:12,096 --> 01:26:14,132
You talking to him right now?

1020
01:26:14,816 --> 01:26:15,692
Yeah.

1021
01:26:19,096 --> 01:26:19,892
No.

1022
01:26:20,576 --> 01:26:21,565
No.

1023
01:26:22,976 --> 01:26:25,251
No, I don't buy that.

1024
01:26:26,016 --> 01:26:28,450
This is getting to be a little bit too much.

1025
01:26:28,536 --> 01:26:31,050
Okay, I'll just have to prove it to her.

1026
01:26:32,016 --> 01:26:34,894
Jack, repeat to Lydia exactly what I say:

1027
01:26:36,336 --> 01:26:37,291
Lydia.

1028
01:26:37,456 --> 01:26:38,206
Lydia.

1029
01:26:38,296 --> 01:26:40,856
I don't blame you for walking out on me
that morning.

1030
01:26:40,936 --> 01:26:43,575
I don't blame you for walking out on me
that morning.

1031
01:26:43,656 --> 01:26:46,329
But it was my heart that was broken,
not my toe.

1032
01:26:46,496 --> 01:26:49,215
But it was my heart that was broken,
not my toe.

1033
01:26:50,296 --> 01:26:51,172
What?

1034
01:26:53,016 --> 01:26:54,005
Tuck?

1035
01:26:57,136 --> 01:26:58,171
It's you.

1036
01:27:08,216 --> 01:27:09,888
Let's just wait a second.

1037
01:27:10,096 --> 01:27:11,085
Tuck?

1038
01:27:13,136 --> 01:27:14,649
I want a moment alone.

1039
01:27:15,056 --> 01:27:18,366
I want you to shut off your sensors,
no picture and no sound.

1040
01:27:18,456 --> 01:27:22,495
Bad idea, Jack.
What if I can't restore contact?

1041
01:27:22,816 --> 01:27:25,694
Look, I want one moment alone.

1042
01:27:27,376 --> 01:27:29,332
Alone with Lydia, you mean?

1043
01:27:29,856 --> 01:27:31,687
You owe this to me.

1044
01:27:33,696 --> 01:27:34,811
Okay, Jack.

1045
01:27:34,936 --> 01:27:36,608
Signing off.

1046
01:27:46,576 --> 01:27:48,487
I'm not sure what I want to say.

1047
01:27:49,936 --> 01:27:51,847
We haven't known each other...

1048
01:27:53,456 --> 01:27:55,526
...very long. Less than a day.

1049
01:27:56,576 --> 01:27:57,850
They're coming.

1050
01:27:58,696 --> 01:28:00,095
So much for words.

1051
01:28:07,736 --> 01:28:09,089
Let's go.

1052
01:28:21,576 --> 01:28:23,328
Jack, come in.

1053
01:28:25,416 --> 01:28:26,929
Jack, do you read me?

1054
01:28:29,096 --> 01:28:31,690
I knew I shouldn't have
shut this thing down.

1055
01:28:32,456 --> 01:28:34,686
Jack! Where the hell am l?

1056
01:28:40,616 --> 01:28:43,176
Mr. Putter, if you please.

1057
01:28:45,496 --> 01:28:47,214
Put the girl in my office.

1058
01:28:53,856 --> 01:28:56,495
Not to worry, Putter.
We know what we're doing.

1059
01:29:12,176 --> 01:29:14,736
We'll use the chip we have
to miniaturize lgoe.

1060
01:29:14,816 --> 01:29:16,374
Then inject him into Putter.

1061
01:29:16,456 --> 01:29:20,847
He'll locate the pod, eliminate its pilot,
and retrieve the second chip.

1062
01:29:28,016 --> 01:29:30,246
Oxygen reserves at 40 percent.

1063
01:29:30,416 --> 01:29:31,405
Jack?

1064
01:29:42,936 --> 01:29:44,335
I was getting some gum.

1065
01:29:44,416 --> 01:29:47,010
Sure, after I check for nail files.

1066
01:30:53,136 --> 01:30:54,125
Lydia.

1067
01:30:57,456 --> 01:30:58,650
I'm in Lydia.

1068
01:31:10,656 --> 01:31:12,169
I'm a dad.

1069
01:31:13,936 --> 01:31:17,770
Duane, it's Lydia.
I'm in trouble. I need help.

1070
01:31:18,016 --> 01:31:22,567
Call the police and tell them
I'm in a renovated factory near pier 18.

1071
01:31:22,936 --> 01:31:23,891
What's up?

1072
01:31:23,976 --> 01:31:26,649
I can't talk now, but call Vector-Scope...

1073
01:31:26,736 --> 01:31:29,773
...and tell them I've got Tuck Pendelton
and I'm bringing him in.

1074
01:31:29,896 --> 01:31:33,286
-And call Pete Blanchard. Got it?
-Yeah, got it.

1075
01:32:34,416 --> 01:32:36,646
Ready to inject subject.

1076
01:32:36,976 --> 01:32:38,091
Wait a minute.

1077
01:32:38,336 --> 01:32:42,011
Once lgoe takes over the pod in Putter,
how do we get the chip out?

1078
01:32:42,616 --> 01:32:46,211
Mr. Igoe will pilot the pod out,
through a tear duct or a sweat gland.

1079
01:32:46,296 --> 01:32:47,570
Why chance that?

1080
01:32:47,656 --> 01:32:50,295
Once he takes over the pod
and gets the chip...

1081
01:32:50,496 --> 01:32:51,929
...let's re-enlarge.

1082
01:32:52,016 --> 01:32:54,484
-While it's still in Mr. Putter?
-Why not?

1083
01:32:55,296 --> 01:32:58,174
Have you any idea
the kind of mess that would make?

1084
01:32:58,576 --> 01:33:00,726
Tuck, help me, make me strong.

1085
01:33:02,976 --> 01:33:04,250
Restrain him!

1086
01:33:08,336 --> 01:33:10,247
He's in! lgoe's in.

1087
01:33:13,096 --> 01:33:14,211
Let him go.

1088
01:33:14,656 --> 01:33:17,295
Young lady, you are in over your head.

1089
01:33:21,096 --> 01:33:22,688
Let him...

1090
01:33:23,496 --> 01:33:24,406
...go.

1091
01:33:29,656 --> 01:33:32,295
-Now what?
-I'll tell you what we'll do.

1092
01:33:33,216 --> 01:33:36,686
-Everybody into the miniaturizer.
-Everybody into the miniaturizer.

1093
01:33:38,296 --> 01:33:39,331
The chip.

1094
01:33:49,936 --> 01:33:51,335
Come on, you too.

1095
01:33:51,536 --> 01:33:53,606
You haven't heard the last of this.

1096
01:33:53,696 --> 01:33:56,005
-Let's go. You got the chip?
-I can't reach it.

1097
01:33:56,096 --> 01:33:57,814
-You can't reach it?
-I can't reach it.

1098
01:33:58,896 --> 01:34:00,488
-Maybe it's one of these.
-Shit.

1099
01:34:01,536 --> 01:34:03,128
Point the gun over there.

1100
01:34:03,456 --> 01:34:05,572
-Nothing's happening.
-Try the green button.

1101
01:34:05,656 --> 01:34:07,965
Don't worry,
they won't know how to close it.

1102
01:34:08,256 --> 01:34:09,530
Certainly not.

1103
01:34:11,536 --> 01:34:13,527
I'll get you for this, Margaret.

1104
01:34:14,056 --> 01:34:16,616
I hope they're not claustrophobic.

1105
01:34:16,696 --> 01:34:18,573
-What are these switches?
-I don't know.

1106
01:34:18,656 --> 01:34:21,216
-You didn't pay attention?
-I was strapped to a table.

1107
01:34:21,296 --> 01:34:22,729
Keep pressing. Try.

1108
01:34:22,816 --> 01:34:23,965
Nothing works.

1109
01:34:24,256 --> 01:34:25,291
This one.

1110
01:34:28,336 --> 01:34:30,008
Oh, my God, cover your eyes.

1111
01:34:35,096 --> 01:34:37,564
Come on, give me the damn chip.

1112
01:34:44,576 --> 01:34:45,770
Drop it!

1113
01:34:52,416 --> 01:34:54,247
Approaching middle ear.

1114
01:34:55,896 --> 01:34:57,693
Please hear this. Please.

1115
01:34:59,176 --> 01:35:01,565
External amplifier activated.

1116
01:35:10,856 --> 01:35:11,811
Listen!

1117
01:35:12,016 --> 01:35:13,495
-Do you hear that?
-Hear what?

1118
01:35:13,576 --> 01:35:15,009
Music, do you hear that?

1119
01:35:15,096 --> 01:35:16,290
No. Come on.

1120
01:35:20,016 --> 01:35:21,927
-We're in here.
-Who's in there?

1121
01:35:22,256 --> 01:35:23,371
The green button.

1122
01:35:23,456 --> 01:35:24,571
Dr. Canker?

1123
01:35:24,656 --> 01:35:27,045
Press the green button, you fool. Hurry!

1124
01:35:27,136 --> 01:35:29,934
-He'll never find it.
-The man's a high school graduate.

1125
01:35:30,016 --> 01:35:32,166
The green button, you fool!

1126
01:35:34,656 --> 01:35:36,487
-The police.
-Who called them?

1127
01:35:36,576 --> 01:35:37,895
Let's get out of here.

1128
01:35:37,976 --> 01:35:39,932
Margaret, look what you've done to us.

1129
01:35:40,016 --> 01:35:43,486
Officer, give me a hand. I know the mayor.

1130
01:35:45,976 --> 01:35:46,965
Hold it!

1131
01:35:47,056 --> 01:35:48,330
You hold it.

1132
01:35:48,696 --> 01:35:50,414
I bet it ain't even loaded.

1133
01:35:50,496 --> 01:35:51,975
Oh, yeah?

1134
01:35:54,296 --> 01:35:57,333
Don't worry.
Tuck will give me the strength of 10 men.

1135
01:36:09,936 --> 01:36:11,528
Car keys. Come on.

1136
01:36:11,776 --> 01:36:13,767
It's our song I'm hearing.

1137
01:36:14,016 --> 01:36:14,892
What?

1138
01:36:15,376 --> 01:36:16,968
Tuck's in me.

1139
01:36:20,136 --> 01:36:22,969
He's playing our song.

1140
01:36:23,456 --> 01:36:25,208
What are you talking about?

1141
01:36:25,696 --> 01:36:27,891
Tuck is inside you?

1142
01:36:28,576 --> 01:36:30,089
That means I just....

1143
01:36:30,256 --> 01:36:31,245
Oh, shit!

1144
01:36:36,376 --> 01:36:37,855
Hi, Mr. Killer.

1145
01:36:39,616 --> 01:36:41,846
I'm really sorry....

1146
01:36:46,536 --> 01:36:48,572
-Where's my Subzero?
-Just get in the car.

1147
01:36:49,816 --> 01:36:52,694
-Will you give me a leg-up?
-Every man for himself.

1148
01:37:01,936 --> 01:37:03,369
How did he get inside me?

1149
01:37:03,456 --> 01:37:05,367
He hasn't spoken to me since....

1150
01:37:05,456 --> 01:37:07,208
Since Scrimshaw's cellar.

1151
01:37:07,776 --> 01:37:09,255
Since you kissed me.

1152
01:37:09,496 --> 01:37:10,690
Kiss me again.

1153
01:37:19,536 --> 01:37:21,174
Can you hear me? I'm back.

1154
01:37:21,256 --> 01:37:22,928
-He's back!
-Let's go.

1155
01:37:29,216 --> 01:37:30,205
Lydia!

1156
01:37:31,016 --> 01:37:32,768
-How we doing?
-We have the chip.

1157
01:37:32,856 --> 01:37:34,574
We're on our way back to Vector-Scope.

1158
01:37:34,656 --> 01:37:37,454
-All right!
-I think that someone is in there with you.

1159
01:37:37,536 --> 01:37:39,925
-What?
-They put him inside me to get to you.

1160
01:37:40,136 --> 01:37:42,172
Inside you? Watch your driving!

1161
01:37:42,616 --> 01:37:45,733
At the lab, they put this guy in.
So just be careful.

1162
01:37:48,616 --> 01:37:51,653
-Will we make it to Vector-Scope in time?
-Can't you go faster?

1163
01:37:51,736 --> 01:37:54,489
Do you want to drive?
I'm going as fast as I can.

1164
01:38:01,656 --> 01:38:03,806
Stop this car!

1165
01:38:06,616 --> 01:38:08,254
I said, "Stop this car! "

1166
01:38:17,896 --> 01:38:20,410
Watch your driving, Jack.
What's going on?

1167
01:38:29,616 --> 01:38:31,493
Get me out of here, Canker.

1168
01:38:32,856 --> 01:38:34,289
Stupid little feet!

1169
01:38:40,616 --> 01:38:44,052
Foreign object approaching
through esophageal passage.

1170
01:38:57,456 --> 01:38:59,333
External malignancy detected.

1171
01:39:11,056 --> 01:39:13,365
Oxygen reserves at 20 percent.

1172
01:39:20,696 --> 01:39:22,812
Warning: Pressurization imbalance.

1173
01:39:25,056 --> 01:39:26,853
Turbo thruster one, disabled.

1174
01:39:29,256 --> 01:39:30,848
Oxygen depletion factor....

1175
01:39:31,136 --> 01:39:33,775
-Get your little hand away.
-I'll drive this car myself.

1176
01:39:38,536 --> 01:39:41,528
You insignificant little pip-squeak,
I'm in charge here!

1177
01:39:41,656 --> 01:39:43,135
Knock him off your lap!

1178
01:39:50,016 --> 01:39:51,290
I'll kill you.

1179
01:39:52,136 --> 01:39:53,728
You want to play?

1180
01:40:02,576 --> 01:40:04,726
Oxygen reserves at 15 percent.

1181
01:40:32,176 --> 01:40:33,165
Lydia!

1182
01:40:33,856 --> 01:40:35,494
Come on, get in the car!

1183
01:40:41,456 --> 01:40:43,287
Take a pull on this, pal!

1184
01:41:09,056 --> 01:41:10,171
Are you all right?

1185
01:41:22,216 --> 01:41:23,968
Life-support system warning.

1186
01:41:24,056 --> 01:41:25,489
The air tanks.

1187
01:41:30,136 --> 01:41:31,455
No booster left.

1188
01:41:41,096 --> 01:41:42,654
Thrusters inoperative.

1189
01:42:10,056 --> 01:42:12,206
Gastrointestinal acid detected.

1190
01:42:17,696 --> 01:42:19,652
Oxygen reserves at 10 percent.

1191
01:42:27,296 --> 01:42:29,605
Jack, are you feeling nervous?

1192
01:42:29,816 --> 01:42:32,933
Actually, I'm feeling pretty relaxed now.

1193
01:42:33,296 --> 01:42:36,447
I need some stomach action,
and I need lots of it.

1194
01:42:36,536 --> 01:42:38,766
No, please. Give me a break.

1195
01:42:39,216 --> 01:42:40,968
Not to alarm you...

1196
01:42:41,096 --> 01:42:43,405
...but I think I saw something down here.

1197
01:42:43,536 --> 01:42:45,845
-It's probably benign, but--
-A tumor?

1198
01:42:45,936 --> 01:42:47,369
You saw a tumor? How big?

1199
01:42:48,016 --> 01:42:51,895
You're asking the wrong guy.
For me, about the size of Candlestick Park.

1200
01:42:52,296 --> 01:42:54,048
Great, there goes my ulcer.

1201
01:42:59,456 --> 01:43:01,924
-Acidity level increased.
-That's it, Jack.

1202
01:43:02,056 --> 01:43:04,126
Keep those stomach acids flowing, Jack!

1203
01:43:06,216 --> 01:43:09,413
Okay, pal, here's how I spell relief.

1204
01:43:29,136 --> 01:43:30,046
Jack...

1205
01:43:30,856 --> 01:43:32,050
...it worked.

1206
01:43:34,216 --> 01:43:36,446
You just digested the bad guy.

1207
01:43:39,056 --> 01:43:41,047
There's a phone, thank God.

1208
01:43:41,376 --> 01:43:43,207
So? All my change is shrunk.

1209
01:43:43,296 --> 01:43:47,528
Use your credit card, Victor.
Don't all big men have credit cards?

1210
01:43:48,336 --> 01:43:50,088
How do we get up there?

1211
01:43:50,936 --> 01:43:52,051
I've got it.

1212
01:43:52,216 --> 01:43:56,050
Cowboy, this is Victor Scrimshaw.
What the hell....

1213
01:43:56,256 --> 01:44:00,568
What you've been through
can't compare with what I've been through.

1214
01:44:00,696 --> 01:44:02,493
Or what I'm going through.

1215
01:44:02,576 --> 01:44:04,931
Cowboy, listen to me.
We need those chips.

1216
01:44:05,016 --> 01:44:07,132
And we need them now, more than ever.

1217
01:44:08,256 --> 01:44:11,566
Warning: Oxygen level critical.
Life-support systems inoperative.

1218
01:44:11,736 --> 01:44:13,089
Switch to manual.

1219
01:44:28,176 --> 01:44:29,165
Jack?

1220
01:44:32,096 --> 01:44:35,611
I'm running out of air.
I hope we're almost there.

1221
01:44:36,696 --> 01:44:38,414
I'm setting a course for the mouth.

1222
01:44:47,496 --> 01:44:49,248
Fire up the boilers.

1223
01:44:50,336 --> 01:44:53,692
Jack, you have to sneeze for me.
Can you do it?

1224
01:44:53,976 --> 01:44:55,091
Sneeze, why?

1225
01:44:55,176 --> 01:44:59,215
I don't have enough oxygen to make it out.
The human sneeze is clocked at 100 mph.

1226
01:44:59,296 --> 01:45:03,892
I'm in your lung now and
my only chance out is for you to sneeze!

1227
01:45:03,976 --> 01:45:05,250
Okay, how?

1228
01:45:05,496 --> 01:45:07,407
-Where is he?
-He's in my lung.

1229
01:45:07,696 --> 01:45:10,085
-He's in the lung!
-Which lung?

1230
01:45:10,576 --> 01:45:13,295
Think pollen, think ragweed, think...

1231
01:45:13,856 --> 01:45:17,246
...animal dander, fur balls, anything!
I don't know!

1232
01:45:17,416 --> 01:45:18,405
Hairspray!

1233
01:45:18,496 --> 01:45:22,125
Get me some hairspray, right away.

1234
01:45:24,016 --> 01:45:25,654
Not mousse! Hairspray!

1235
01:45:42,936 --> 01:45:44,289
Bless you, Jack.

1236
01:45:44,416 --> 01:45:46,213
-Mr. Putter.
-No.

1237
01:45:47,856 --> 01:45:50,006
Somebody hand me the optivisor. Quick!

1238
01:45:54,416 --> 01:45:56,054
I see it, I see the pod.

1239
01:45:56,496 --> 01:45:58,646
Tweezers, has somebody got some?

1240
01:45:59,416 --> 01:46:00,405
Quickly.

1241
01:46:03,216 --> 01:46:04,205
Quickly.

1242
01:46:16,176 --> 01:46:17,165
Go.

1243
01:46:24,216 --> 01:46:26,730
-Activate the re-enlargement process.
-No! The chip.

1244
01:46:26,816 --> 01:46:28,932
Who has the chip?

1245
01:46:29,016 --> 01:46:31,405
-I've got the chip.
-The chip, you've got it?

1246
01:46:32,096 --> 01:46:33,688
Where is it?

1247
01:46:35,416 --> 01:46:37,407
The chip! There's the chip.

1248
01:46:37,496 --> 01:46:39,487
Go! Go! Go!

1249
01:46:40,296 --> 01:46:43,049
There's the chip. There it is.
Go! Go! Go!

1250
01:46:52,736 --> 01:46:54,488
We don't have time for this.

1251
01:46:55,056 --> 01:46:56,614
Thanks for telling me.

1252
01:46:56,816 --> 01:46:58,727
PEMS one and two functional.

1253
01:47:00,496 --> 01:47:01,690
What is this?

1254
01:47:01,776 --> 01:47:03,255
"Eat me, drink me"?

1255
01:47:03,416 --> 01:47:04,769
It's from The Exorcist.

1256
01:47:04,856 --> 01:47:09,486
No, Alice in Wonderland.
She drank something and became small.

1257
01:47:10,096 --> 01:47:12,451
-Or was it the other way around?
-I don't know.

1258
01:47:12,536 --> 01:47:14,288
-Pick one.
-You pick one.

1259
01:47:19,376 --> 01:47:22,254
Great. Somebody get us some flashlights.
Hurry!

1260
01:47:24,416 --> 01:47:26,725
-Are we okay?
-If it's the right program.

1261
01:47:27,656 --> 01:47:29,214
Activate centrifuge.

1262
01:47:29,936 --> 01:47:32,006
We need some goggles here.

1263
01:47:32,736 --> 01:47:34,328
Activate laser pre-light.

1264
01:47:35,456 --> 01:47:37,048
Laser pre-light activated.

1265
01:47:37,136 --> 01:47:38,808
Initiate MRD sequence.

1266
01:47:38,896 --> 01:47:40,887
MRD sequence initiated.

1267
01:47:41,056 --> 01:47:42,045
Five...

1268
01:47:42,696 --> 01:47:45,164
...four, three, two...

1269
01:47:46,016 --> 01:47:47,608
...one, zero.

1270
01:47:49,256 --> 01:47:50,405
Well?

1271
01:47:50,536 --> 01:47:52,094
Maybe it was "drink me."

1272
01:47:58,976 --> 01:48:00,489
Disengage cooker shield.

1273
01:48:00,616 --> 01:48:02,368
Let's get him out of there!

1274
01:48:02,456 --> 01:48:04,253
Initiating shield disengagement.

1275
01:48:36,016 --> 01:48:37,415
I love you, Lydia.

1276
01:48:40,656 --> 01:48:42,294
Why didn't you tell me?

1277
01:49:10,496 --> 01:49:12,407
Welcome home, Lieutenant.

1278
01:49:17,216 --> 01:49:18,695
Like a cigar?

1279
01:49:19,456 --> 01:49:20,445
Cuban?

1280
01:49:55,016 --> 01:49:57,405
-Congratulations.
-Thanks a lot.

1281
01:50:00,776 --> 01:50:02,653
Thanks for the cruise tickets.

1282
01:50:02,736 --> 01:50:05,728
-It's only two years' savings.
-Is that all?

1283
01:50:12,696 --> 01:50:13,685
Well...

1284
01:50:15,296 --> 01:50:17,366
...we sure made one hell of a team.

1285
01:50:26,256 --> 01:50:27,735
Take care, Big Jack.

1286
01:50:54,656 --> 01:50:57,011
Nobody even noticed my cufflinks.

1287
01:51:04,336 --> 01:51:06,054
He has the chips on him.

1288
01:51:07,096 --> 01:51:08,688
Good. Close the lid.

1289
01:51:08,936 --> 01:51:11,655
-I can't breathe in here.
-Shut up, Margaret.

1290
01:51:11,976 --> 01:51:14,934
It's true, Jack.
The whole shipment had worms.

1291
01:51:15,336 --> 01:51:18,965
Listen, don't run any red lights, okay?
Thanks a lot.

1292
01:51:35,936 --> 01:51:37,005
Nice wedding.

1293
01:51:37,096 --> 01:51:39,564
Why don't you stop by the office
next week?

1294
01:51:39,656 --> 01:51:42,090
I got some new tests I'd like to run.

1295
01:51:42,496 --> 01:51:43,485
Jack!

1296
01:51:44,336 --> 01:51:48,773
I've been thinking about something.
I really think we should try dating.

1297
01:51:48,896 --> 01:51:51,456
Not exclusively at first, at least for me.

1298
01:51:51,696 --> 01:51:56,133
Jack, since you're not going on the cruise,
I could use you at the store on Monday.

1299
01:51:57,376 --> 01:51:58,855
That was the Cowboy.

1300
01:51:59,416 --> 01:52:00,769
Who's the Cowboy?

1301
01:52:00,896 --> 01:52:02,329
It's classified.

1302
01:52:04,656 --> 01:52:06,408
Doc, I'm cured.

1303
01:52:07,816 --> 01:52:09,966
Wendy, not a chance.

1304
01:52:11,336 --> 01:52:13,247
Mr. Wormwood, thank you.

1305
01:52:14,296 --> 01:52:15,411
And I quit.

1306
01:52:20,016 --> 01:52:21,847
Jack Putter to the rescue!

1307
01:56:15,016 --> 01:56:18,008
