1
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,085
OK.

2
00:00:35,003 --> 00:00:39,424
Jackson came over to play.

3
00:00:41,592 --> 00:00:43,886
Superheroes!

4
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:50,184
I was Black Power Ranger.

5
00:00:55,565 --> 00:00:58,610
He was Batman.

6
00:00:58,693 --> 00:01:00,862
Jake, are you OK in there, buddy?

7
00:01:00,945 --> 00:01:03,031
I'm OK.

8
00:01:05,491 --> 00:01:07,827
Can I ask you a question?

9
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:11,205
OK! Time to hit the sack.

10
00:01:11,289 --> 00:01:15,126
- An important question.
- There we go, big guy. Come on.

11
00:01:17,128 --> 00:01:22,175
- Can I wear bugs?
- Bug pyjamas... are all the way downstairs.

12
00:01:22,258 --> 00:01:24,344
But fire trucks are here.

13
00:01:24,427 --> 00:01:26,095
- Bugs.
- Fire trucks.

14
00:01:26,387 --> 00:01:27,764
- Bugs.
- Fire trucks.

15
00:01:27,847 --> 00:01:30,767
- Bugs.
- OK, bugs.

16
00:01:31,768 --> 00:01:34,270
I'll be right back.

17
00:01:46,574 --> 00:01:49,118
Does it hurt to be dead?

18
00:01:56,459 --> 00:01:58,962
- Animal.
- What did I do now?

19
00:01:59,045 --> 00:02:01,047
- Can I tell him?
- If you wanna die.

20
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:03,716
- Well, your beer-addled sperm still work.
- Lisa!

21
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,678
- You impregnated my sister again.
- Bitch!

22
00:02:06,761 --> 00:02:09,347
- I thought you wanted me to?
- I said "Don't"!

23
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:12,600
The kid could have been born
before he'd notice.

24
00:02:12,684 --> 00:02:17,939
- You're not pregnant.
- I feel "Congratulations" is more appropriate.

25
00:02:18,022 --> 00:02:20,817
- You told her before you told me.
- She's a witch!

26
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:23,820
She took one look at me and guessed.

27
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:26,489
Say something!

28
00:02:26,572 --> 00:02:28,574
Bummer.

29
00:02:28,908 --> 00:02:30,910
Something else!

30
00:02:33,454 --> 00:02:37,792
So... she's six weeks pregnant.
That means the baby's due in April, May,...

31
00:02:38,209 --> 00:02:41,129
...June. Gemini. That's cool.
Einstein was a Gemini.

32
00:02:41,212 --> 00:02:45,383
- So's that Scottish gal from Garbage.
- Will you go help Jake with his pyjamas?

33
00:02:45,466 --> 00:02:48,177
- If she's late...
- Lisa, I swear to God,...

34
00:02:48,261 --> 00:02:52,223
...start with the Dionne Warwick stuff,
I'll throw you out the fuckin' window.

35
00:02:52,307 --> 00:02:56,185
- So please help him with the pyjamas.
- Love you, too, Tom!

36
00:02:57,395 --> 00:03:00,106
Hey, this is great. I mean it.

37
00:03:00,189 --> 00:03:03,776
It's about time we had another kid.
I was gonna bring it up myself.

38
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:05,945
- Really?
- Absolutely!

39
00:03:06,029 --> 00:03:09,866
- This time, you gotta take some time off.
- Please! We can't afford that!

40
00:03:09,949 --> 00:03:14,495
- We can. I'm gonna hit the overtime again.
- I don't want you to work those hours again.

41
00:03:14,579 --> 00:03:18,333
You come home in a trance.
You're completely useless to me.

42
00:03:18,416 --> 00:03:20,710
I'm gonna be fine, OK?

43
00:03:20,793 --> 00:03:24,756
I'm just gonna tell Teddy
to get somebody else for the thing.

44
00:03:24,839 --> 00:03:27,759
- Oh, God! Oh, Tom!
- What?

45
00:03:27,842 --> 00:03:31,095
I'm sorry. I completely forgot.
No wonder you're pissed off.

46
00:03:31,179 --> 00:03:35,558
I'm not pissed off. I just...
No, I'm... I'm not. I'm not.

47
00:03:35,642 --> 00:03:40,647
I'm a grown man. I shouldn't be screwing
around with some shitty band anyway.

48
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:45,151
Hey, look, I-I... I gotta go change.
You know, put on something cool.

49
00:03:49,781 --> 00:03:51,866
I love you.

50
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:54,869
I'm... I'm a happy guy.

51
00:03:58,915 --> 00:04:03,211
You know, I'm not gonna be a lineman
forever, I promise you that.

52
00:04:04,462 --> 00:04:06,756
Whaddaya mean?

53
00:04:06,839 --> 00:04:09,968
I clip... clip wire all day.
A monkey could do it.

54
00:04:10,051 --> 00:04:13,554
Yeah, but they're gonna
move you into the office soon.

55
00:04:13,638 --> 00:04:19,185
No, I meant, when we first got together, I said
a lotta stuff about what I was gonna be,...

56
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:24,565
...and I just wanted you to know that, uh...
I wasn't giving you some kinda line,...

57
00:04:24,649 --> 00:04:27,318
...that I meant it.

58
00:04:29,487 --> 00:04:33,449
I didn't marry you because I thought
you were gonna be famous.

59
00:04:34,492 --> 00:04:37,829
I just liked the way your ass looked in jeans.

60
00:04:37,912 --> 00:04:44,544
I never wanted to be famous. I just, uh...
I didn't expect to be... so...

61
00:04:44,627 --> 00:04:46,504
What?

62
00:04:46,587 --> 00:04:48,840
I don't know.

63
00:04:48,923 --> 00:04:51,134
Ordinary.

64
00:05:22,248 --> 00:05:24,334
Shhh.

65
00:05:30,673 --> 00:05:32,967
Hang on! Hang on!

66
00:05:42,518 --> 00:05:44,687
You know, I hope it's a girl.

67
00:05:44,771 --> 00:05:49,275
I'm kinda sick of all these balls
around the house. Except for yours, babe.

68
00:05:49,359 --> 00:05:52,904
What are the odds on an educated single man
being at this thing?

69
00:05:52,987 --> 00:05:55,073
And I don't mean a GED!

70
00:05:55,156 --> 00:05:59,786
- Does it matter if he's on the boner pill?
- I wouldn't look a gift-boner in the mouth.

71
00:05:59,869 --> 00:06:02,497
Nice - that's very nice, Lisa!

72
00:06:04,624 --> 00:06:08,044
- Hey! How you been?
- Hey, Tom, Tom, Tommy! How ya doin'?

73
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:10,171
Oh, you would not believe the day I had.

74
00:06:10,254 --> 00:06:12,465
- Take this. I'll get another.
- Thanks.

75
00:06:12,548 --> 00:06:15,510
- Harry.
- Tom. Taking care of the place for me?

76
00:06:15,593 --> 00:06:19,222
We're drilling holes all over your floors!
I hope you don't mind.

77
00:06:19,305 --> 00:06:22,016
Tom, you know my squaw Sheila.
Bobby, Vanessa.

78
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:26,521
- Thanks for having me.
- Drink up! Take your medicine.

79
00:06:26,604 --> 00:06:28,690
Tom, how do you like the neighbourhood?

80
00:06:28,773 --> 00:06:32,485
I grew up in Bridgeport,
so it's not like it's a foreign country.

81
00:06:32,568 --> 00:06:36,406
You're goddamn right.
This is the best neighbourhood in Chicago.

82
00:06:36,489 --> 00:06:41,703
We all look out for each other. That's
saying a lot as we approach the year 2000.

83
00:06:41,786 --> 00:06:44,914
- Are you running for mayor?
- Hey, did any of you guys...

84
00:06:44,998 --> 00:06:48,334
- ...see them crank dealers...
- What is Lenny doing here?

85
00:06:48,418 --> 00:06:50,586
Bobby, did you tell him you had a party?

86
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:56,259
- Vanessa made me. We invited everybody.
- To actually invite this jack- off...!

87
00:06:56,342 --> 00:06:58,428
Oh, yeah, laugh it up!

88
00:06:58,511 --> 00:07:02,181
When you wake up dead with your throat cut,
don't come crying to me!

89
00:07:02,974 --> 00:07:06,060
Not attracted to.

90
00:07:06,936 --> 00:07:09,480
Not drunk enough for.

91
00:07:09,564 --> 00:07:11,357
Frightened by!

92
00:07:24,245 --> 00:07:26,331
Argh!

93
00:07:27,332 --> 00:07:29,584
Don't touch me. I'm fine.

94
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:54,651
Haven't you heard about people being
operated on when they're under hypnosis?

95
00:07:54,734 --> 00:07:56,819
Yeah, but I don't believe in any of that.

96
00:07:56,903 --> 00:08:00,573
People who say they were hypnotised
were just playing along.

97
00:08:00,657 --> 00:08:01,991
- Certo.
- Really?

98
00:08:02,075 --> 00:08:07,330
Then how could they have a scalpel stuck
into their throat without even bleeding?

99
00:08:07,413 --> 00:08:09,624
- Bullshit!
- You never saw that happen!

100
00:08:09,707 --> 00:08:12,085
- That's bullshit!
- Learn another word!

101
00:08:12,168 --> 00:08:14,420
Yeah, what about "narrow-minded"?

102
00:08:14,504 --> 00:08:19,384
I saw a guy in my class get a two-inch needle
stuck into his arm by my instructor...

103
00:08:19,467 --> 00:08:23,054
- ...when he was under hypnosis.
- Horseshit! That better, honey?

104
00:08:23,137 --> 00:08:25,765
I saw a picture of it the next day.
It left a mark.

105
00:08:25,848 --> 00:08:29,560
What I don't understand is
how a person that's been to college...

106
00:08:29,644 --> 00:08:31,980
...can believe all that superstitious crap.

107
00:08:32,063 --> 00:08:34,357
- It isn't superstitious!
- Come on!

108
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,860
- I'm practically a licensed hypnotherapist.
- "Practically"?

109
00:08:37,944 --> 00:08:41,406
Isn't that like saying
"I don't have a licence"? Ow! My arm!

110
00:08:41,489 --> 00:08:46,911
This may come as a surprise to you, but just
because you lived here for your whole life...

111
00:08:46,995 --> 00:08:50,707
...doesn't mean that there isn't
a whole larger world out there,...

112
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:55,670
...doorways you haven't even opened, things
you wouldn't have any understanding of.

113
00:08:55,753 --> 00:08:59,966
Doorways... OK, OK. All right, Kreskin,
prove it - hypnotise somebody.

114
00:09:00,049 --> 00:09:02,427
- Yeah! Do me.
- No.

115
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:04,596
- Why not?
- For one, you're hostile.

116
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:07,181
I'm not hostile!
Do I seem hostile to anybody?

117
00:09:07,265 --> 00:09:11,185
- Uh... yeah.
- Thanks for having us. It was a great party.

118
00:09:11,269 --> 00:09:16,107
Nah, nah, this is just getting good.
Come on, Lisa. Hypnotise me. Come on!

119
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:18,484
- No. You're drunk.
- I'm not drunk!

120
00:09:18,568 --> 00:09:22,155
You're not supposed to mesmerise
somebody who's been drinking!

121
00:09:22,238 --> 00:09:25,450
Mesmerise! No! Stop!

122
00:09:25,533 --> 00:09:28,286
Oh, please! I'm begging you.
Educate the savages.

123
00:09:28,369 --> 00:09:31,372
It won't work with
that kind of uncooperative attitude.

124
00:09:31,456 --> 00:09:34,792
I swear to you, I'll follow
every instruction to the letter.

125
00:09:34,876 --> 00:09:36,961
It still won't work.

126
00:09:37,045 --> 00:09:38,713
Come on.

127
00:09:38,796 --> 00:09:41,716
What's the worst that can happen?

128
00:09:43,092 --> 00:09:46,554
- Somebody turn out the lights.
- Oh, yeah!

129
00:09:46,638 --> 00:09:49,098
Whoo!

130
00:09:49,182 --> 00:09:55,480
All right, just relax. Put your arm down.
Just rest it comfortably. Just lean back.

131
00:09:55,563 --> 00:09:58,191
Just be very comfortable and relaxed.

132
00:09:58,858 --> 00:10:01,402
Trust me. OK?

133
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:06,324
- Close your eyes.
- Certainly, Lisa.

134
00:10:09,285 --> 00:10:12,538
Now... just listen for a moment.

135
00:10:12,622 --> 00:10:16,084
Listen to the sounds of the room around you.

136
00:10:17,126 --> 00:10:20,380
I don't know why, but I'm scared.

137
00:10:21,339 --> 00:10:25,051
Now I want you to pretend
you're in a theatre.

138
00:10:25,134 --> 00:10:27,845
A movie theatre,

139
00:10:30,223 --> 00:10:32,725
You're the only one there.

140
00:10:33,768 --> 00:10:37,063
It's one of those great old movie palaces.

141
00:10:38,106 --> 00:10:42,652
When you look around,
it's a huge, empty theatre.

142
00:10:43,695 --> 00:10:48,908
You notice that the walls of the theatre
are painted in black.

143
00:10:51,869 --> 00:10:55,290
The seats... are covered in black.

144
00:10:55,915 --> 00:10:58,459
And in the whole pitch-black theatre,...

145
00:10:58,543 --> 00:11:03,756
...there's only one thing you can see,
and that's the white screen.

146
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:08,928
You'll notice there are letters on the screen...
tall, thick, black letters.

147
00:11:09,012 --> 00:11:14,601
But they're out of focus, so you drift closer
to them in your chair, trying to read them.

148
00:11:14,684 --> 00:11:18,938
You're very comfortable now.
It's your favourite chair.

149
00:11:19,022 --> 00:11:23,192
You're drifting closer and closer,
staring at the letters.

150
00:11:23,276 --> 00:11:26,529
Very relaxed now. Your legs are relaxed.

151
00:11:26,613 --> 00:11:28,948
Your arms are limp and heavy.

152
00:11:29,032 --> 00:11:32,118
You're almost close enough
to read the letters now.

153
00:11:32,201 --> 00:11:34,579
They start to come into focus.

154
00:11:34,662 --> 00:11:37,373
The letters spell "sleep".

155
00:11:39,042 --> 00:11:41,127
Sleep.

156
00:11:46,716 --> 00:11:48,217
No!

157
00:11:48,259 --> 00:11:50,970
- What the hell was that?

158
00:11:54,933 --> 00:11:58,770
- What? What? What?
- Are you OK? You had to be faking it.

159
00:11:58,853 --> 00:12:01,856
That was the weirdest goddamn thing
I've seen in my life!

160
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:06,027
Congratulations, Tom!
You're one of the lucky eight percent!

161
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:09,906
- You still have tears on your cheeks.
- What the hell did she do to me?

162
00:12:09,989 --> 00:12:13,242
- Christ, I'm thirsty.
- Whaddaya mean? What eight percent?

163
00:12:13,326 --> 00:12:18,164
There's only eight percent of the population
that's, like, highly hypnotisable.

164
00:12:18,247 --> 00:12:20,500
Almost anybody can go under a little,...

165
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:24,671
...but not way under -
not freaky under, like he did.

166
00:12:24,754 --> 00:12:27,840
- How's your hand?
- Whaddaya mean?

167
00:12:27,924 --> 00:12:33,179
I stuck a safety pin in your hand and asked
you to bleed on one side, but not the other.

168
00:12:33,263 --> 00:12:36,724
- Which I can't believe you did!
- You were very cooperative.

169
00:12:36,808 --> 00:12:39,018
It was a side of you I hadn't seen before.

170
00:12:39,102 --> 00:12:41,229
- That happened?
- You said it didn't hurt.

171
00:12:41,312 --> 00:12:44,816
To hell with the pin!
I wanna know more about your Joey Luca.

172
00:12:44,899 --> 00:12:47,068
Yeah, right!

173
00:12:47,151 --> 00:12:49,445
- Who?
- Joey Luca is the kid who...

174
00:12:49,529 --> 00:12:52,407
...used to pound the shit out of you
when you were 12.

175
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:55,535
You told us all about it. You were crying.
It was hysterical!

176
00:12:55,618 --> 00:12:59,747
- Shut up.
- It was very moving, Tom.

177
00:12:59,831 --> 00:13:02,709
Joey Luca! Jesus Christ,
I haven't thought about him...

178
00:13:06,629 --> 00:13:08,548
Hey.

179
00:13:08,631 --> 00:13:11,593
Can we go home? I... I feel kinda strange.

180
00:13:11,676 --> 00:13:15,054
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

181
00:13:44,459 --> 00:13:46,836
Close your eyes.

182
00:15:24,934 --> 00:15:26,019
Uh!

183
00:15:27,103 --> 00:15:29,814
What's the matter?

184
00:15:29,897 --> 00:15:31,357
Don't stop.

185
00:15:31,441 --> 00:15:34,944
- Don't stop.
- OK.

186
00:15:52,962 --> 00:15:56,549
Ugh! Jesus Christ! Oh, my God!

187
00:15:56,633 --> 00:15:59,719
- What?
- I-I... I'm seeing things.

188
00:15:59,802 --> 00:16:01,888
What do you mean?

189
00:16:01,971 --> 00:16:05,475
Oh, no, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.
I-I can't right now.

190
00:16:05,558 --> 00:16:09,479
- Then you were faking it extremely well.
- Ohh...

191
00:16:10,521 --> 00:16:13,399
Wait. Stop, stop, stop! It's too weird.

192
00:16:13,483 --> 00:16:17,779
Baby, that wasn't weird.
I could show you weird.

193
00:16:20,239 --> 00:16:22,992
I felt like I was being attacked.

194
00:16:24,035 --> 00:16:26,245
Thanks!

195
00:16:26,329 --> 00:16:30,083
I'm sorry, I didn't...
I didn't...

196
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:32,794
I-I... I'll be right back.

197
00:16:52,981 --> 00:16:55,942
What the fuck...?!

198
00:16:56,985 --> 00:17:00,780
Ah... Agh... Agh!

199
00:17:00,863 --> 00:17:04,951
Arghhh...

200
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:07,745
Argh!

201
00:18:16,606 --> 00:18:20,401
Agh! Agh!

202
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:59,232
- Hey, Jake.
- You're awake now, Daddy.

203
00:19:01,317 --> 00:19:03,403
Are you OK?

204
00:19:03,903 --> 00:19:05,989
Yeah. Yeah, I guess.

205
00:19:07,532 --> 00:19:09,951
I just don't feel so good right now.

206
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:24,299
Don't be afraid of it, Daddy.

207
00:19:36,311 --> 00:19:39,772
- What was it, then? An hallucination?
- Yeah, a bunch of 'em.

208
00:19:39,856 --> 00:19:45,028
It's like all these thoughts just kept coming.
You believe this? I got seven calls.

209
00:19:45,111 --> 00:19:48,406
Well, if it never happened before,
it had to be the hypnosis.

210
00:19:48,489 --> 00:19:51,367
I had this headache and I was thirsty as hell.

211
00:19:51,451 --> 00:19:55,246
Jake! I know you're not watching
that monster tape again!

212
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:57,415
Who was the woman?

213
00:19:57,498 --> 00:20:02,795
I don't know. Maybe somebody I was just
remembering. She didn't look familiar.

214
00:20:02,879 --> 00:20:05,506
- Did you fuck her?
- You gotta be kidding.

215
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:08,635
No. I mean, was she someone
you used to go out with?

216
00:20:08,718 --> 00:20:12,096
You're jealous of my hallucination?
Hmm, you are pregnant!

217
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:16,309
- You should call Lisa.
- No, she's the one that fucked up my brain.

218
00:20:16,392 --> 00:20:19,479
- Then she has to unfuck it.
- Ooh! Agh! Fuck! Fuck!

219
00:20:19,562 --> 00:20:21,648
Don't swear so much!

220
00:20:21,731 --> 00:20:25,234
Hang on, hang on!
Let me get my bearings here.

221
00:20:25,318 --> 00:20:30,448
I have... I have absolutely no caffeine
in my system, you know.

222
00:20:30,531 --> 00:20:33,952
OK. You're asking me if I gave you a post...

223
00:20:34,035 --> 00:20:36,079
...posthypnotic suggestion.

224
00:20:36,162 --> 00:20:40,166
Did you leave anything else behind
when you were inside my brain?

225
00:20:40,249 --> 00:20:42,627
- Nothing!
- Tell the truth, Lisa.

226
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:46,714
Tom! Please, this is insulting.
You know, I have done this before.

227
00:20:47,715 --> 00:20:50,426
OK, good. I-I was... I was just making sure.

228
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:52,679
It was just a harmless one anyway.

229
00:20:53,429 --> 00:20:55,890
- What?
- Did it actually work?

230
00:20:55,974 --> 00:20:58,977
- What did you say?
- I don't wanna tell you. You're grouchy.

231
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:01,312
Lisa, I swear to God...!

232
00:21:01,396 --> 00:21:06,109
Well, you know I've always said I think
you need to be a little more open-minded?

233
00:21:06,192 --> 00:21:08,987
- Yeah...
- So I just said that.

234
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:13,157
"After you wake up, your mind will be
completely open, like an open door,...

235
00:21:13,241 --> 00:21:15,910
...open to receive everything around you."

236
00:21:15,994 --> 00:21:19,998
- What's that supposed to do?
- Fuck if I know! I never said it before.

237
00:21:20,081 --> 00:21:22,959
- Why? Did something happen?
- Jesus Christ!

238
00:21:23,042 --> 00:21:27,338
Relax. OK? I opened a door, that's all.
You know, therapists do it all the time.

239
00:21:27,422 --> 00:21:31,759
It releases repressed memories,
whatever you got back there.

240
00:21:31,843 --> 00:21:37,056
- For you, it was probably old Mannixreruns.
- I gotta get back to work.

241
00:21:39,892 --> 00:21:42,103
OK. Alrighty, then!

242
00:21:45,398 --> 00:21:47,900
No! No more calls for Lisa!

243
00:21:48,943 --> 00:21:51,821
Hey, Lise, it's me.

244
00:21:51,904 --> 00:21:56,117
Call me when you wake up. Is there any way
you could baby-sit for us on Friday?

245
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:59,037
I did! I told him!

246
00:22:01,539 --> 00:22:03,416
What's your name?

247
00:22:03,499 --> 00:22:05,209
OK.

248
00:22:05,293 --> 00:22:07,545
...but then I gotta hear about it for a month.

249
00:22:07,629 --> 00:22:10,798
I called everyone who could possibly do it
and no one's free.

250
00:22:10,882 --> 00:22:13,718
- Call Vanessa.
- Huh?

251
00:22:13,801 --> 00:22:16,804
I said, call Vanessa and ask her about Debbie.

252
00:22:16,888 --> 00:22:19,724
Anyway, call me back. Bye.

253
00:22:19,807 --> 00:22:22,644
Debbie? That's the girl
who baby- sits for them?

254
00:22:22,727 --> 00:22:23,853
Yep.

255
00:22:23,937 --> 00:22:27,273
Oh, great idea. Pray she's free.

256
00:22:27,357 --> 00:22:30,443
- How'd you know about Debbie?
- Samantha told me.

257
00:22:30,526 --> 00:22:34,489
Hey, Vanessa.
Are you guys going out Friday night?

258
00:22:37,825 --> 00:22:39,744
Hi. I'm Debbie.

259
00:22:42,372 --> 00:22:44,499
Kozak...?

260
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,629
Tom Witzky.

261
00:22:52,924 --> 00:22:55,009
- Hi, Debbie. I'm Maggie.
- Hi.

262
00:22:55,093 --> 00:22:58,972
Thanks for coming. Jake's asleep already
and he hardly ever wakes up.

263
00:22:59,055 --> 00:23:02,976
A band could play in his room
and he wouldn't hear it!

264
00:23:03,059 --> 00:23:07,772
His room's upstairs, kitchen's back there.
Just help yourself if you want anything.

265
00:23:07,855 --> 00:23:10,483
Here, have a seat.
This is the baby monitor.

266
00:23:11,526 --> 00:23:14,320
It's on B in his room,
so you should hear everything.

267
00:23:14,404 --> 00:23:16,531
- You wanna watch a movie?
- I got a book.

268
00:23:16,864 --> 00:23:19,450
It shouldn't be later than midnight,
if that's OK.

269
00:23:19,534 --> 00:23:22,620
- Perfect.
- Great. I'll just grab my coat.

270
00:23:22,704 --> 00:23:25,081
Hel-lo!

271
00:23:25,456 --> 00:23:27,208
Ready?

272
00:23:27,292 --> 00:23:29,085
- Yeah. Just about.
- OK.

273
00:23:29,168 --> 00:23:32,922
Hey. Uh... where'd you find that girl Debbie?

274
00:23:33,006 --> 00:23:37,927
Vanessa gave me her number.
Everybody uses her. It's cool.

275
00:23:38,011 --> 00:23:41,973
- Another headache?
- Too much caffeine.

276
00:23:42,056 --> 00:23:45,310
Oh. OK, let's go.

277
00:23:46,269 --> 00:23:48,354
Bye.

278
00:23:54,152 --> 00:23:57,488
I think that Damon kid
is doing a great job and everything,...

279
00:23:57,572 --> 00:24:01,534
...and yeah, the kid's got a decent arm,
but high-school football is about...

280
00:24:01,618 --> 00:24:06,205
...power, it's about running the goddamn
football - it always has been.

281
00:24:06,289 --> 00:24:08,625
What did you play in high school?

282
00:24:08,708 --> 00:24:12,587
- Piano, mostly.
- Oh, Jesus! Sorry. Here, you want some?

283
00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:17,175
Anyway, Adam...
and I admit that I am biased,...

284
00:24:17,258 --> 00:24:21,095
...but my kid is having a helluva season
and it's like nobody even notices.

285
00:24:21,179 --> 00:24:23,848
If they gave him the ball,
he could break a thousand yards!

286
00:24:23,932 --> 00:24:26,643
And that's in an eight-game season.
Jesus Christ!

287
00:24:26,726 --> 00:24:29,938
Why don't you just lick 'em
when they walk by?

288
00:24:36,778 --> 00:24:41,574
Frank says the average guy carries around
a hard- on two hours out of every day.

289
00:24:41,658 --> 00:24:46,371
- Three for him.
- See, now I got a picture of that!

290
00:24:46,454 --> 00:24:50,875
One of these days, she's gonna find
one of my .38s and pop a cap in my ass!

291
00:24:51,167 --> 00:24:55,296
He'll stick it in a bowl of soup
if it's still warm.

292
00:25:04,639 --> 00:25:07,100
Go! Go!

293
00:25:20,947 --> 00:25:24,200
- Are you OK?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

294
00:25:28,788 --> 00:25:31,958
Over a thousand yards,
we're talking college scholarship!

295
00:25:32,041 --> 00:25:35,753
Hey, come on...
The kid can write his own ticket.

296
00:25:35,837 --> 00:25:40,174
And that's good for everybody. It's good
for the whole goddamn neighbourhood.

297
00:25:40,258 --> 00:25:43,052
He's gonna go a helluva lot further
than lever did.

298
00:25:43,136 --> 00:25:48,141
Look at the quality of tail he gets. He passed
me in that department when he was 14.

299
00:25:48,224 --> 00:25:51,269
Come on! While we're young, huh?

300
00:26:19,213 --> 00:26:21,841
You scared me!

301
00:26:24,010 --> 00:26:26,137
She's downstairs, I think.

302
00:26:29,891 --> 00:26:33,311
I don't know.
I haven't seen her yet.

303
00:26:42,028 --> 00:26:43,529
Jake?

304
00:26:47,075 --> 00:26:49,535
- What's the matter?
- Something's wrong.

305
00:26:49,619 --> 00:26:50,870
What?

306
00:27:00,088 --> 00:27:02,257
I have a secret to tell you.

307
00:27:03,925 --> 00:27:06,219
Promise, promise, promise?

308
00:27:15,353 --> 00:27:18,690
Samantha says it's always dark where she is.

309
00:27:20,149 --> 00:27:22,360
Who did you say?

310
00:27:22,443 --> 00:27:24,279
Samantha.

311
00:27:27,824 --> 00:27:31,160
You... you talked to Samantha?

312
00:27:31,244 --> 00:27:32,745
Yeah!

313
00:27:32,829 --> 00:27:34,664
When?

314
00:27:34,747 --> 00:27:36,833
All the time.

315
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:42,171
- Where?
- Here. In my house.

316
00:27:42,505 --> 00:27:43,965
That's not true.

317
00:27:44,507 --> 00:27:47,093
Go.

318
00:27:47,176 --> 00:27:48,219
Go!

319
00:27:51,472 --> 00:27:53,683
- It isn't true.
- I don't tell lies!

320
00:27:53,766 --> 00:27:56,019
Samantha was here? Here, in your house?

321
00:27:56,102 --> 00:27:58,521
- You're hurting my arm!
- Was she here?!

322
00:27:58,605 --> 00:28:02,191
- Let go of me!
- Come on, you're coming with me. Let's go.

323
00:28:02,817 --> 00:28:05,653
She's taking him away.

324
00:28:14,329 --> 00:28:17,916
Put me down! Put... me... down!

325
00:28:22,211 --> 00:28:24,172
Tom!

326
00:28:35,141 --> 00:28:36,809
Jake!

327
00:28:37,268 --> 00:28:39,354
Jake!

328
00:28:40,188 --> 00:28:42,941
Jake!

329
00:28:43,024 --> 00:28:44,943
- What the hell...?
- She took him.

330
00:28:45,026 --> 00:28:46,736
- What?!
- The fucking baby-sitter.

331
00:28:46,819 --> 00:28:48,446
Oh, my God!

332
00:28:48,529 --> 00:28:51,032
He's... He's not in there.

333
00:28:51,115 --> 00:28:54,744
- Where are you going?
- I don't know!

334
00:29:26,943 --> 00:29:29,696
He's in there.

335
00:29:54,012 --> 00:29:55,471
- Jake!
- Daddy!

336
00:29:55,555 --> 00:29:58,641
- That's him!
- Wait! Where do you think you're going?!

337
00:29:58,725 --> 00:30:01,728
Take it easy! Stop! Stop!
Take it easy. Take it easy.

338
00:30:01,811 --> 00:30:04,814
- Gimme my kid.
- Tell me where she is! No!

339
00:30:04,897 --> 00:30:07,609
You tell me where she is!
You tell me where she is!

340
00:30:07,692 --> 00:30:10,903
- Keep your hands off her!
- Hey! Hey, hey! Everybody shut up!

341
00:30:10,987 --> 00:30:14,490
- Are you OK?
- That girl kidnapped our son.

342
00:30:14,574 --> 00:30:16,868
- Is that your child?
- Ask about Samantha.

343
00:30:16,951 --> 00:30:20,163
I'm asking about the boy,
who doesn't look like he's yours!

344
00:30:20,246 --> 00:30:21,331
I can explain this.

345
00:30:21,372 --> 00:30:23,750
I'm not talking to you.
I'm talking to her.

346
00:30:23,833 --> 00:30:25,919
- Is that boy your child?
- No.

347
00:30:26,002 --> 00:30:28,504
She was baby-sitting for us. We never...

348
00:30:28,588 --> 00:30:31,799
What you've done is a felony.
You can go to jail for this!

349
00:30:31,883 --> 00:30:34,969
- Where were you taking him?
- I wasn't taking him anywhere!

350
00:30:35,053 --> 00:30:38,097
- Then why did ya bring him here?
- I wanna press charges.

351
00:30:38,181 --> 00:30:40,767
She came here because of me.
I'm her mother.

352
00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:45,063
- Her mother?
- When are you gonna ask about Samantha?

353
00:30:45,146 --> 00:30:47,941
- Who?
- My oldest daughter. She ran away.

354
00:30:48,024 --> 00:30:51,402
No, she was kidnapped,
and the little boy said he saw her!

355
00:30:51,486 --> 00:30:55,073
We haven't heard from her in a long time.
We filed a police report.

356
00:30:55,156 --> 00:30:58,576
- Nobody returns our phone calls.
- Jake said he talked to her.

357
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:01,746
He said Samantha is in their house.
Is that her?!

358
00:31:01,829 --> 00:31:04,666
- Stay away from him.
- Look at the picture.

359
00:31:04,749 --> 00:31:06,626
- Let go of me!
- Look at the picture.

360
00:31:06,709 --> 00:31:10,880
- This is ridiculous.
- Will you look at the picture, please?

361
00:31:14,467 --> 00:31:18,763
- I have never seen her before in my life.
- What about you?

362
00:31:19,847 --> 00:31:23,142
No. I'm sorry. I've never seen her.

363
00:31:23,226 --> 00:31:27,063
- No... No. No, they're lying!
- You wanna file charges?

364
00:31:27,146 --> 00:31:28,481
- Yes!
- No.

365
00:31:28,564 --> 00:31:32,652
- What?
- Come on, let's just, uh... forget about it.

366
00:31:33,236 --> 00:31:35,154
Let's go home.

367
00:31:35,238 --> 00:31:38,366
Are you nuts? What about
the next people she baby-sits for?

368
00:31:38,449 --> 00:31:40,702
It was her. Samantha.

369
00:31:40,785 --> 00:31:45,540
That girl in the picture,
she's the same girl I saw on our couch.

370
00:31:45,623 --> 00:31:50,128
See, why... Why did you ask that girl Debbie
to baby-sit for us? Why her?

371
00:31:50,211 --> 00:31:54,757
I couldn't find anybody else.
I was on the phone and Jake said...

372
00:31:57,969 --> 00:32:03,141
Jake? Do you remember the other day
when we were talking in the kitchen?

373
00:32:04,601 --> 00:32:10,315
I was looking for a baby-sitter, remember?
You said Samantha told you about Debbie.

374
00:32:10,398 --> 00:32:12,567
Do you remember that?

375
00:32:14,736 --> 00:32:17,238
Mommy's asking you a question, bud.

376
00:32:18,990 --> 00:32:22,368
Is Samantha someone
who talks to you sometimes, Jake?

377
00:32:24,621 --> 00:32:29,500
- Can you remember...
- Don't ask the boy any more questions.

378
00:32:29,584 --> 00:32:31,711
Talk to me.

379
00:32:33,922 --> 00:32:37,050
- What did you say?
- Huh?

380
00:32:37,967 --> 00:32:40,887
Jake. W-what did you say just now?

381
00:32:41,512 --> 00:32:44,390
- Nothing.
- Let me hear that voice again.

382
00:32:44,474 --> 00:32:47,894
- Come on. Say it again. Use that voice again.
- Tom!

383
00:32:47,977 --> 00:32:50,730
Come... Come on, Jake. Come on.
Use the voice again.

384
00:32:50,813 --> 00:32:53,775
- Tom!
- Make the voice again, Jake. You can do it.

385
00:32:53,858 --> 00:32:55,652
- Tom, don't!
- How do you...

386
00:32:55,735 --> 00:32:58,279
- Tom, please!
- It's all right! It's all right!

387
00:32:58,363 --> 00:33:01,366
- OK!
- What are you doing? Hey! Hey!

388
00:33:01,449 --> 00:33:03,660
I'm talking to him!

389
00:33:04,619 --> 00:33:07,830
- Hey, what's the matter with you?
- What do you think?

390
00:33:07,914 --> 00:33:11,626
Well, I... I'm just trying
to have a conversation with my kid.

391
00:33:11,709 --> 00:33:14,837
A perfectly normal conversation
for a five-year-old!

392
00:33:14,921 --> 00:33:17,048
- Don't be afraid of it.
- Why the hell not?

393
00:33:17,131 --> 00:33:20,343
I don't know. That's what he told me.

394
00:33:20,426 --> 00:33:22,971
This is where it happened.
This is where I saw her.

395
00:33:23,054 --> 00:33:27,600
- You're different. You feel different.
- I leaned back and there she was. She's 18.

396
00:33:27,684 --> 00:33:30,478
- Longish hair. Is that what you saw?
- I wish you...

397
00:33:30,561 --> 00:33:33,106
- Maggie, please!
- God!

398
00:33:33,189 --> 00:33:37,694
Or... or maybe you don't see her, huh?
You just hear her? Is that what it is?

399
00:33:37,777 --> 00:33:41,030
- Tom, stop it!
- I need to find a way to make her come back.

400
00:33:41,114 --> 00:33:44,575
- Maybe if I hang out here long enough,...
- I'm talking to you!

401
00:33:44,659 --> 00:33:48,413
...maybe she'll come back. Maybe
you could talk to her. Help me out here.

402
00:33:48,496 --> 00:33:53,042
- Hey, come on! Hey! What's the problem?
- Knock it off!

403
00:33:56,129 --> 00:33:59,882
I don't wanna talk about this
because it scares Mommy.

404
00:34:52,769 --> 00:34:54,854
- Turn it up, man.
- What?

405
00:34:54,938 --> 00:34:57,231
Turn it up. Up!

406
00:35:19,712 --> 00:35:23,174
Tom is looking especially together today.

407
00:35:23,258 --> 00:35:26,469
He grunted a very pleasant greeting
at me, actually.

408
00:35:26,552 --> 00:35:30,765
He's becoming sort of monosyllabic.
Nothing wrong with that guy.

409
00:35:30,848 --> 00:35:33,977
Nothing a little lithium couldn't cure!

410
00:35:37,563 --> 00:35:40,733
- I'm a jerk. I'm sorry.
- No...

411
00:35:42,694 --> 00:35:44,445
Are you OK?

412
00:35:44,529 --> 00:35:47,156
Over there! In the door!

413
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:50,910
If you live on the base,
your room and board's covered.

414
00:35:50,994 --> 00:35:56,124
- You still gotta get up early.
- I'll retire, make a coupla down payments.

415
00:35:56,207 --> 00:35:59,127
When I take off the uniform,
I'm a landlord already.

416
00:35:59,210 --> 00:36:01,963
Five years later, I got three houses.

417
00:36:02,046 --> 00:36:04,340
- Hey. Hey, Har.
- How're ya doin'?

418
00:36:04,424 --> 00:36:07,635
Whaddaya know
about that girl Samantha Kozak?

419
00:36:07,719 --> 00:36:10,680
Samantha Kozak. Why do I know that name?

420
00:36:10,763 --> 00:36:14,892
Brownish hair, 16 or 17 years old.
Used to live around here.

421
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:17,687
- Oh, yeah, yeah. I remember her, I think.
- Let's go.

422
00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:20,773
Hey, Kurt! Come here for a second.

423
00:36:20,857 --> 00:36:23,359
Like he ever tells me anything, right?

424
00:36:23,443 --> 00:36:26,154
Get over here!

425
00:36:27,572 --> 00:36:29,657
Say, you know that Kozak girl?

426
00:36:29,741 --> 00:36:32,744
- Uh... Debbie.
- No, no, no, the other one. Samantha.

427
00:36:32,827 --> 00:36:36,497
Oh, you mean the retard.
Yeah, she ran away.

428
00:36:36,581 --> 00:36:39,542
Yeah, that's right. I remember that.
So, what about her?

429
00:36:39,876 --> 00:36:43,379
Oh, I... I just been thinking about her a lot.

430
00:36:45,632 --> 00:36:47,133
Why?

431
00:36:48,009 --> 00:36:50,720
Her sister baby-sat for us.

432
00:36:54,682 --> 00:36:56,225
Oh.

433
00:36:56,684 --> 00:36:59,437
This is the first time
he's been out in a week.

434
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:02,231
He hasn't gone to work.
He sleeps 12 hours a night.

435
00:37:02,315 --> 00:37:07,779
He's used up all his sick days. If he doesn't
show up on Monday, they'll dock him. I...

436
00:37:09,530 --> 00:37:12,075
I can't get him more than six feet
from the couch.

437
00:37:12,158 --> 00:37:15,954
- Why?
- That's where she appeared to him.

438
00:37:16,037 --> 00:37:18,206
Ah.

439
00:37:18,289 --> 00:37:20,708
I'm not shocked that there's another woman.

440
00:37:20,792 --> 00:37:24,587
Of course, the fact that she's dead
gives one pause.

441
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:28,758
We are talking about a ghost here,
aren't we, Maggie?

442
00:37:28,841 --> 00:37:32,971
She took off, uh... last March.
With a black guy, I think.

443
00:37:33,054 --> 00:37:36,057
Hey, Harry. Did she ever live in our house?

444
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:40,436
No, no, no. I just... I just bought that one.
You're the first tenants.

445
00:37:40,895 --> 00:37:44,983
Tom and Jake, it's like they have
this private club or something.

446
00:37:45,066 --> 00:37:49,737
They sit in the living room and whisper,
and, as soon as I walk in, they both shut up.

447
00:37:49,821 --> 00:37:54,742
You know what you need to do? Find a
young priest with smouldering good looks...

448
00:37:54,826 --> 00:37:57,287
...who can guide you through this.

449
00:37:57,370 --> 00:37:59,706
I'm kidding, but I'm not.

450
00:37:59,789 --> 00:38:05,003
Look, I give Tom a lotta shit, but the truth is,
you guys are the best couple on earth.

451
00:38:05,086 --> 00:38:09,382
This is on you now, Maggie. Get some help.
Find out why this is happening.

452
00:38:09,465 --> 00:38:11,676
There is a reason.

453
00:38:11,759 --> 00:38:16,431
You won't be the first woman who's
had to hold an insane family together.

454
00:38:16,514 --> 00:38:18,975
Tom's not crazy.

455
00:38:19,058 --> 00:38:23,146
Oh, yes he is. But at least
he's getting interesting.

456
00:38:23,229 --> 00:38:25,315
Sports flash! Sports flash!

457
00:38:25,398 --> 00:38:27,650
211 yards rushing on Friday night.

458
00:38:27,734 --> 00:38:31,237
That's a total of 894 yards,
with two games to go.

459
00:38:31,321 --> 00:38:33,948
The kid needs 106 yards. That's 53 a game.

460
00:38:34,032 --> 00:38:37,535
He could walk through the next two games
and still break a thousand!

461
00:38:37,619 --> 00:38:40,622
- Frank, what about you? Do you know her?
- Who?

462
00:38:40,705 --> 00:38:43,875
Tom was asking about that Kozak girl
from over by Baldwin.

463
00:38:43,958 --> 00:38:47,503
- You remember: the one who ran away?
- The retard.

464
00:38:47,587 --> 00:38:49,839
Shut up, Lenny. Don't use that word.

465
00:38:49,923 --> 00:38:52,508
- He's just kinda slow.
- What? Retard?!

466
00:38:52,592 --> 00:38:55,053
Goddammit, Lenny,
shut your fuckin' pie hole!

467
00:38:55,136 --> 00:38:57,388
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Heads up!

468
00:39:00,725 --> 00:39:04,103
- What are you doing?!
- Hey, hey, hey!

469
00:39:04,896 --> 00:39:10,526
Somebody's always gotta ruin it.
They can't ever just be nice.

470
00:40:07,875 --> 00:40:10,587
Frank. What are you doing here?

471
00:40:13,131 --> 00:40:15,842
They're gonna kill you, Tommy.

472
00:40:17,802 --> 00:40:20,513
You and Maggie both.

473
00:40:35,111 --> 00:40:38,156
Why would you
say something like that, Frank?

474
00:40:38,239 --> 00:40:41,159
This is a decent neighbourhood.

475
00:40:44,495 --> 00:40:47,123
Hey, are you OK?

476
00:40:47,206 --> 00:40:50,168
Where's Sheila? Is she at home?

477
00:40:54,047 --> 00:40:56,591
Listen, I'm gonna go see if Sheila's at home.

478
00:40:56,674 --> 00:40:58,551
OK?

479
00:41:00,887 --> 00:41:04,933
In the house! Come on, both of you!

480
00:41:20,698 --> 00:41:23,201
Come in!

481
00:41:24,285 --> 00:41:26,746
Hi. Is your mom at home cos your dad's...

482
00:41:26,829 --> 00:41:29,874
Hey... you wanna see what I've got?

483
00:41:32,418 --> 00:41:34,837
Sure.

484
00:41:37,048 --> 00:41:39,342
That's great. Is that one of your dad's?

485
00:41:39,884 --> 00:41:42,387
Not today. Come here.

486
00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:45,223
Oh, why don't you just
put the gun away, Adam?

487
00:41:45,306 --> 00:41:49,143
- Come on, man. Come here.
- Those things make me kinda nervous.

488
00:41:49,227 --> 00:41:53,356
- Then this will make you really nervous.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! Don't do that!

489
00:41:53,439 --> 00:41:54,691
Don't!

490
00:41:55,650 --> 00:41:56,734
Argh!

491
00:42:20,008 --> 00:42:22,719
Please don't be under there.

492
00:42:26,764 --> 00:42:28,308
Oh, boy.

493
00:42:54,876 --> 00:42:56,377
Frank?

494
00:42:56,461 --> 00:42:59,213
In the house! Come on, both of you!

495
00:43:29,494 --> 00:43:30,954
Adam!

496
00:43:31,037 --> 00:43:33,331
Adam! Open the door!

497
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:36,584
Oh, my God. Oh, God!

498
00:43:50,598 --> 00:43:52,684
Help!

499
00:43:54,769 --> 00:43:57,063
Help!

500
00:43:57,146 --> 00:43:59,691
Am I awake... or asleep?

501
00:43:59,774 --> 00:44:01,859
Help!

502
00:44:07,865 --> 00:44:10,577
Oh, my God! Oh, my God, my baby!

503
00:44:10,660 --> 00:44:13,538
- Hold on. Hold on.
- Let me... Let me go!

504
00:44:13,621 --> 00:44:18,585
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- Is he alive? Is he alive?

505
00:44:18,668 --> 00:44:23,214
Oh, my God, Adam!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

506
00:44:26,301 --> 00:44:29,095
Adam! Adam!

507
00:44:34,309 --> 00:44:37,520
I'm gonna take him for a walk or something.

508
00:44:38,563 --> 00:44:42,150
- Come on, sweetie pie. Let's get your jacket.
- Where are we going?

509
00:44:50,909 --> 00:44:52,994
Ha-ha!

510
00:44:58,458 --> 00:45:02,795
- Well! Hello, there!
- Well, hello... there.

511
00:45:05,632 --> 00:45:07,717
Listen! Music!

512
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:09,969
It's beautiful!

513
00:45:12,889 --> 00:45:15,058
Hey! Jake, wait up!

514
00:46:00,937 --> 00:46:06,609
I don't think we're supposed to be here,
sweetie. Come on, let's go. This way.

515
00:46:14,617 --> 00:46:17,245
Whoa! This place is cool!

516
00:46:38,349 --> 00:46:41,477
Come on, honey. Let's go get some lunch.

517
00:46:49,861 --> 00:46:52,113
Mom! What's this thing?

518
00:46:52,196 --> 00:46:56,034
- I don't know. Let me take a look.
- It looks like some kinda stone.

519
00:46:56,117 --> 00:46:59,245
- Either that, or it's a medal.
- Yeah, I think it is.

520
00:46:59,329 --> 00:47:02,457
- "Served in the..."
- Look. A flag.

521
00:47:05,209 --> 00:47:08,880
- Everything OK?
- It's fine. Just fine.

522
00:47:09,714 --> 00:47:13,176
- We're not supposed to be here?
- Hm?

523
00:47:13,259 --> 00:47:17,138
- Oh, no. It's fine. Really.
- Oh.

524
00:47:17,805 --> 00:47:20,850
OK. See you later.

525
00:47:20,934 --> 00:47:23,478
The boy's got the eyes on him, doesn't he?

526
00:47:26,189 --> 00:47:28,399
X-ray.

527
00:47:32,111 --> 00:47:34,822
Not you, though.

528
00:47:35,239 --> 00:47:37,784
Possibly Daddy?

529
00:47:38,826 --> 00:47:41,162
They're not the only ones.

530
00:47:41,246 --> 00:47:45,416
Tell Daddy to come by and see me
a little later tonight.

531
00:47:46,042 --> 00:47:48,753
He might learn a few things.

532
00:47:56,678 --> 00:47:58,763
Bye, Jake.

533
00:48:02,308 --> 00:48:03,851
Bye, Neil.

534
00:48:09,774 --> 00:48:12,318
His name is Neil.

535
00:48:44,434 --> 00:48:47,020
Try that, Daddy.

536
00:48:53,443 --> 00:48:55,528
Why do I know that song?

537
00:48:55,612 --> 00:48:57,822
I'll be home right after the movie.

538
00:48:57,905 --> 00:49:00,533
I know it. I know it!

539
00:49:00,617 --> 00:49:02,994
I said, I won't be late.

540
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,168
OK.

541
00:49:10,251 --> 00:49:12,879
Bye, Mom. Bye, Maggie.
