00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,920
- You know Mom hates when I'm late.
- I told you...

2
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:30,120
we should have left earlier.
It's the same damn thing every year.

3
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,080
It's always: "Where are my
blue shoes, dear?"

4
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,880
Or: "Dad, I can't find
my Marilyn Bronson CD."

5
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,680
- Marilyn Manson.
- Whatever her name is.

6
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,920
- She's a guy, dad.
- Marilyn? A guy?

7
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,440
What's the world coming to?

8
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,840
- Oh, boy...
- Are you all right, darling?

9
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,760
Yeah.

10
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,240
Dad! Dad!

11
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,040
Oh, God!

12
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,640
My God, what happened?

13
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,640
- Are we there yet?
- Is anybody hurt?

14
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,080
- Marion, are you okay?
- Are you crazy?

15
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,680
- You almost killed us!
- I'm sorry. I must have dozed off.

16
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,320
I hope you slept well. Maybe
I should whip you up some breakfast.

17
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,320
Nobody is hurt.
Get off my back, all right?

18
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,760
For Pete's sakes, why don't you
let someone else drive, for once?

19
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,360
Don't worry.
That woke me up.

20
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,760
The pie is probably ruined.

21
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,360
- Oh, Jesus!
- What is that?

22
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:06,520
- It's pumpkin and chocolate.
- Smells like ass.

23
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,040
I'd better go out and check the car.

24
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,920
The son of a bitch didn't even stop!

25
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,920
- Where are we?
- We're on the road.

26
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:30,360
- What does it look like?
- What happened to the Interstate?

27
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,600
I thought we could take
the back-way for a change.

28
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,080
What's wrong with the Interstate?
We've taken it for years!

29
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,000
I was bored.

30
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,440
And I didn't wanna... fall asleep.

31
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,360
- That seemed to work.
- All right.

32
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:49,920
Car looks okay.
No damage.

33
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,320
- Want me to take the wheel, dad?
- No, thank you, dear.

34
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,480
- I'm growing attached to this car.
- Here we go again.

35
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,920
Did you or did you not put
the Mercedes in the junkyard?

36
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,760
- It wasn't my fault!
- I'm just teasing you, sweetheart.

37
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,120
There certainly aren't
very many people on this road.

38
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:40,840
It's Christmas Eve. Most people
are at home, with their families.

39
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,440
- Damn, I'm starving!
- Me too.

40
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,440
I hope your mother doesn't get
experimental with that turkey.

41
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,240
Look, can we drop the subject?
I don't feel very good.

42
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,800
Are you okay, honey-bunny?
You want us to stop?

43
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,040
Long car rides make me queasy. And
all this talk food isn't helping any.

44
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:02,000
- How about a couple of bookers?
- Shut up, Richard!

45
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:06,000
- Or some Macaroni and dick-cheese.
- Richard, that's disgusting!

46
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:11,080
But, mom, there really is a cheese
called dick-cheese. Chinese make it.

47
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,720
You've had dick-cheese before,
right, Brad?

48
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:22,440
- Grow up, Richard.
- It's 7:30 already, darling.

49
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:26,600
I'm aware of that, Laura. I thought
we'd come to a junction by now.

50
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,760
Jesus, Laura, do you have
to suck on it like that?

51
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:37,880
- That's the way I drink.
- All right, you guys. Calm down.

52
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,200
- Take it easy.
- Marion is right.

53
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:44,960
When I played baseball, they taught
us this technique to help us relax.

54
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,160
I still use it sometimes.

55
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:53,040
You breathe in deeply through your
nose and out through your mouth.

56
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,200
Thank you, Brad.

57
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,280
Yeah, thanks, Brad.

58
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:03,880
- Can I ask you a question, though?
- Sure.

59
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,600
Was your entire school gay,
or was it just the baseball team?

60
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,560
- Richard!
- What?

61
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:13,960
Richard, it's a technique we use
to helps us get in what we call...

62
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,720
..."The Zone".
- The Homo Zone?

63
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,560
Richard!

64
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,440
This is such a beautiful night!

65
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:34,200
Does anybody know the name of that
really bright star right in front of us?

66
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,520
There's 150 billion stars
up there, for Christ's sake.

67
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:47,520
That one I know. That bright one is
the North Star. The only one I know.

68
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,680
Thank you.

69
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:07,120
- Let's sing a song, everybody.
- Okay. What?

70
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:11,040
- How about "Yellow Submarine"?
- We always do that one.

71
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:16,520
- Brad, how about "Y.M.C. A"?
- It's Christmas, so how about...

72
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,880
"Jingle Bells"?

73
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,120
Come on. Come on.

74
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,480
You like that part, don't you?

75
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,200
Why did you stop?

76
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,880
A woman.
I saw a woman in the forest.

77
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,360
- Cool. Dad is tripping out.
- Richard.

78
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,800
- Are you sure, dad?
- Well, yeah.

79
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,400
Dressed in white.
She was holding something.

80
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,760
Fuck!

81
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,000
Hi there.

82
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:39,360
We are a little lost.

83
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,600
You wouldn't happen to know the
quickest way back to the highway?

84
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,640
Are you all right?

85
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,760
Did you have
an accident or something?

86
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:53,120
Okay. Anybody got a cell phone?

87
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,560
- No signal.
- We just passed the cabin.

88
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,520
Maybe there's a phone. Richard, be
a gentleman and make room for her.

89
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,480
- Let Brad be the gentleman.
- What's your problem, man?

90
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,480
Relax, buddy.

91
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:12,160
Breath in slowly through your nose
and out deeply through your ass!

92
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,280
- It's all right, Mrs. Harrington.
- I'll walk.

93
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:20,040
- I could use the fresh air, anyway.
- You're not walking by yourself.

94
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,920
- I wanna be alone.
- Marion!

95
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,960
- Let me tell you something, smart guy.
- What?

96
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,760
Keep busting my balls and I'll
take you out of the game for good.

97
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,840
- Understand me?
- Yes, sir!

98
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,800
We'll meet you down there in
just a minute. Okay, honey?

99
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,360
Okay.

100
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,640
All right.

101
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:51,400
Okay, we'll see you there, honey.

102
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,800
Shit!

103
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:26,160
Would you like a nice
hot cup of coffee?

104
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,400
I think she's in shock. We should
have asked Marion what to do.

105
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:40,280
Honey, we don't need a shrink.
We'll call 911.

106
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,360
- Okay.
- They'll know how to handle it.

107
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,480
Damn! Fucking stinks in here.

108
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,920
It's the baby...

109
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,440
jack-ass.

110
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:14,440
- Where are you going, sweetie?
- Away from you guys.

111
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,360
Teenagers.

112
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:22,120
What's your name?

113
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,800
Where do you live?

114
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,960
- She's not gonna be much help.
- No.

115
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,240
Hello, Miss July.

116
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,640
Does anybody live here?

117
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:23,160
Maybe it's one of those old
forest ranger stations.

118
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:38,680
Jesus, Laura.
You scared the shit out of me.

119
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:44,080
Sorry. They have very interesting
wall hangings, these rangers.

120
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,960
So, what's his name?

121
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,160
Do it, baby.

122
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,120
You got a ring. You married?

123
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:17,080
Marion and I are getting married.

124
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,600
Actually...

125
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:26,440
don't say anything but I'm proposing
to her tonight at her grandmother's.

126
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:31,680
Remember when you said you would
kill yourself if I ever left you?

127
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,400
I hope that was just
a figure of speech, 'cause...

128
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:45,720
Brad, we've had some
great times together, but...

129
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:50,400
I think we need to go on
with our lives separately.

130
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,560
Shit.

131
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:01,280
- Damn!
- Was there no dial tone?

132
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:04,240
Nao, Laura, I just forgot
the number for 911.

133
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,400
It's Amy.

134
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,760
My little girl.
Her name is Amy.

135
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:23,600
- She's so cold.
- Not surprised. It's freezing here.

136
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:29,400
- You hold her.
- No.

137
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:33,320
I'm not really a baby kind of guy.

138
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,920
How does she breathe with
all those blanket on her face?

139
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,880
Don't worry.

140
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,600
She's dead.

141
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,520
That's a good one.

142
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:57,840
Oh, my God!

143
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,680
Shit!

144
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,520
- What the hell was that?
- Richard!

145
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:06,880
Richard!

146
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,520
- Yeah, I'm here!
- Get over here.

147
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,160
Where's Brad and the lady?

148
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,000
- Brad!
- Are you okay?

149
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:21,680
- Yeah, I'm fine. What's going on?
- Brad!

150
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,440
Hey, dickhead!

151
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:50,200
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

152
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:56,080
- Dad?
- What?

153
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,080
- They got Brad.
- What are you talking about?

154
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:00,280
- I saw Brad in a car! We gotta go.
- What car?

155
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,200
We've gotta go!

156
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,240
Frank, slow down.
You are gonna kill us all.

157
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:09,320
You saw a car driving by
and Brad was in the back of it?

158
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,080
- Yes.
- I don't get that! Why...

159
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:15,320
I saw him. They were hurting him.
You have to stop them!

160
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:18,440
- Okay! Where the hell did they go?
- Maybe they took a side road.

161
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,640
Did you see one?
Me neither.

162
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:25,600
- At least you don't drive like a pussy.
- Shut up, asshole!

163
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,280
- What's going on?
- Why did you stop?

164
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,640
Laura, give me the flashlight, please.

165
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,680
Where's he going?

166
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:51,240
- Why did he stop?
- Just a minute.

167
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,840
Stay back. Stay back!

168
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,520
Don't come over here,
for God's sake.

169
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:14,520
- Fuck me!
- Oh, God!

170
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,360
Richard, get your sister
back in the car now.

171
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:21,480
My baby.
Do you have her?

172
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,800
Jesus Christ...

173
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,360
What is he doing?

174
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:53,080
He's trying to get Brad's phone.

175
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,440
- With a stick?
- You got a better idea?

176
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,800
I can't believe I'm gonna do this.
Look out.

177
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,160
Oh, God...

178
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,480
Good boy, Richard.

179
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,640
Give it to me.

180
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:52,720
And drop that.
That thing is dirty.

181
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,200
You got a signal?

182
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,920
Thank God. We can call the police
and they will tell us what to do.

183
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,120
- Okay.
- Now.

184
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:05,400
- Now.
- Now.

185
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:15,800
Please, somebody help me.
Please!

186
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,680
God! I can't feel my legs.

187
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:24,520
I can't feel my legs!

188
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:29,320
- Help me! My baby is bleeding!
- Who is this?

189
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,080
Baby! Wake up!

190
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,560
- Anybody, please help us.
- Oh, Jesus!

191
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:40,080
Somebody, please, help us.

192
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:46,600
Frank, we gotta get out of here.

193
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:49,440
- Did you get the police?
- The phone, it was broken.

194
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:52,280
- Shit.
- Please, let's go.

195
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:56,120
We can't leave him here like this.

196
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:01,400
Richard, drag his body off
to the side of the road.

197
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:04,080
Jesus, what do I look like?
Your fucking janitor?

198
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,920
Thank God. Oh, Marion.

199
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:20,040
Are you all right?
You're gonna be okay.

200
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,080
Marion. Marion?

201
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,440
Marion? Wake up.

202
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,800
Wake up. Come on, wake up.
Wake up! Wake up!

203
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,440
Laura! Stop!

204
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,800
Stop it!

205
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,800
Can't you see she's in shock?

206
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,280
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

207
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:50,320
Dad, that guy...

208
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,520
or whoever did that...

209
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:58,280
...must've used an axe or a chainsaw.
- It was the work of one sick psycho.

210
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,640
- Let's get the hell out of here.
- Wait. What about that woman?

211
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,800
Maybe she got away.

212
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:07,240
- Maybe the psycho got her.
- So, you wanna go after him?

213
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:13,240
Richard, get in.
We're going to the police.

214
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:19,320
- Why don't we go back to Interstate?
- Your mother lives by the sheriff's.

215
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,760
We'll be there in 15 minutes.

216
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:30,000
Marcott? Never heard of it.

217
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,160
Richard, check the map.

218
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,480
Marcott...

219
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,920
Gimme a second.

220
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:46,040
- There's no Marcott on this map.
- Just give it to me.

221
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:57,560
- I don't see it either.
- Maybe that's because it's not there!

222
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:03,520
- Laura, give me the local map.
- I didn't bring it.

223
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,880
- You didn't bring it?
- We never needed it before.

224
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:10,240
- I asked you to. Remember?
- I had a lot of things to take care of.

225
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,240
- The presents and...
- Who gives a fuck about presents?

226
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,040
Would you please
watch your language?

227
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:21,560
I'm sorry, but how was I supposed to
know you're gonna take a shortcut?

228
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,200
And how was I supposed to know that
you were going to forget the map?

229
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:29,280
We've been coming here for 20 years,
and you'd never taken a shortcut.

230
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,600
I'll bring a globe in case you feel
like driving by way of the North Pole!

231
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,800
Is there any coffee left?

232
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,080
A little.

233
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:55,440
Okay. Pour me some.
Let's go to Marcott, then.

234
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:26,040
Is anybody else a bit freaked out
we are the only car in the road now?

235
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,480
It's Christmas Eve.

236
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:36,360
Yeah. Okay. How long
have we been driving?

237
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,280
It's 7:30.

238
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:42,800
You said it was 7:30
when we took that lady into the car.

239
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,280
That damn thing is broken.
All right. Who's got a watch?

240
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,280
- I have a watch. It stopped at 7:30.
- Come on.

241
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:57,080
Don't you guys think that
this is just a little wacked?

242
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:01,840
I know you guys think
I'm retarded or whatever...

243
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:05,800
but I have a theory and I want you
to hear me out, okay?

244
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:13,320
Brad is dead. His body is mutilated
and God knows how it got that way.

245
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:19,040
We are the only people out here and
all the clocks have stopped at 7:30.

246
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:22,480
This reeks of
alien activity, you guys.

247
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,160
- Blow me.
- What?

248
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,320
Nothing.

249
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,640
Laura...

250
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,960
can you make her stop that, please?

251
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:19,840
- Let her. Maybe it will help.
- It's getting on my nerves.

252
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,320
I can't believe I fell asleep.

253
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,840
- How long was I out?
- I don't know. Maybe 10 minutes.

254
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,640
Are we still on that same road?

255
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:08,040
- Still no Marcott?
- No. No Marcott.

256
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:12,160
- I don't understand. Did we pass it?
- No, I haven't seen anything.

257
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:14,840
No lights, no signs, no nothing.

258
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:23,760
Shit! What is that?

259
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:26,680
- It's a baby carriage.
- I can see it's a baby carriage.

260
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:31,000
- Okay. I'll get out and I'll go see.
- No. Don't.

261
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:34,120
- Why?
- Just get going. I don't like this.

262
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:38,560
- Richard, come back here! Richard!
- Stop yelling in my ear!

263
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,880
Richard, come back here!

264
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Hey, little guy!

265
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:50,000
Richard! Frank, no!

266
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,360
- You guys suck!
- I'm gonna kill that kid.

267
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,280
Oh, God!

268
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,120
- What the hell was that?
- Man, that was good!

269
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:03,240
- This is so not funny, Richard!
- It's a baby carriage. Why fear?

270
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,480
- It's empty.
- No shit!

271
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:09,800
- That is so not funny!
- Nice job. That was dumb.

272
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,400
What is it now?

273
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:29,480
I can't stop thinking about Diane.
How are we gonna tell her about Brad?

274
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:32,920
- He was our responsibility.
- I don't wanna worry about that now!

275
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:37,800
I just wanna figure out some
goddamn way to get out of here.

276
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,680
I'm sorry.

277
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,600
Talk about a merry
fucking Christmas.

278
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,520
You are not gonna open that.
That's my Uncle Herb's present.

279
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:01,480
I need this a whole hell of a lot more
than your Uncle Herb right now.

280
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:14,200
Let's face it. We are lost, Frank.
This road is not going to Mom's.

281
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,720
Let's turn around.
We should turn around, Frank.

282
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:22,240
We just passed a sign.
Marcott can't be too far.

283
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,120
Hey, Sis.

284
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:41,120
Mom... Mom and Dad are kinda
going off the deep end, huh?

285
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:47,040
They are really losing it.

286
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:54,080
This whole thing is
pretty fucking crazy, huh?

287
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,680
Mare?

288
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,200
Mare?

289
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:13,200
Come on, you've gotta snap
out of it, okay? You have to.

290
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,640
We need you back here.

291
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:23,120
I... I need you.

292
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:28,720
Mom is always going on about
what a great shrink you are, so...

293
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:34,080
you are the only person that can
figure a way out of this. Damn it!

294
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:48,680
Do you remember when
your hamster disappeared...

295
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,560
and I told you it had been
abducted by aliens?

296
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:56,000
Well, I lied. Okay?
It was me.

297
00:29:56,200 --> 00:30:00,000
Me and Kevin. We stuck it
in the microwave and we fried it.

298
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,760
Marion?

299
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,080
Dad!

300
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,600
Dad, it's here again.

301
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:33,840
Richard, I am fed up
with your stupid jokes.

302
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:37,480
- It wasn't me this time. I swear.
- Richard, we do not have time...

303
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:41,320
Christ! I'm telling you the truth,
your fucking assholes!

304
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:44,200
Frank, would you say something
for once?

305
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,640
- I think we'd better get out of here.
- Get going.

306
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:24,640
We should have passed
a town or a gas station or...

307
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:28,600
a motel, or a crossroads,
a junction, something by now!

308
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,960
I know. I know.
Just calm down, Laura.

309
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:35,400
It's probably one of those closed
roads that forest rangers use.

310
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,280
God! I just feel like
we've been driving forever.

311
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:41,360
What is this forest?
Is this like the Amazon?

312
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:45,480
Last year, I had to drive to Lakewood
to talk with a client and I went...

313
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:49,160
...on a very roundabout way.
- What you seem to do sometimes.

314
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:53,440
I was driving and driving until I had
to turn back to the road I came from.

315
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:56,240
- What are you talking about?
- Some of these roads are designed...

316
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:59,760
by engineers who weren't qualified
to build a goddamn bird house!

317
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:02,640
- So?
- So? That's that!

318
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,880
That's that...

319
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:11,600
Lakewood? Isn't there where
Sally Schmidt bought her cottage?

320
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,840
Yeah, I think so.

321
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,720
Jesus Christ!

322
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:26,600
- What was that?
- Some kind of a radio talk show.

323
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:29,800
- That was no talk show.
- A public radio, or something.

324
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Public radio? Right.

325
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:35,520
- No! Damn it!
- You just said it was public radio!

326
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,680
I don't know what it was!
I don't wanna know what it was!

327
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:41,040
I just wanna get to the police
before anything else goes wrong.

328
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,720
And I thought last year's
Christmas was bad.

329
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,560
And what was wrong with
last year's Christmas?

330
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:50,120
- Let's see... Everything?
- I thought last year was great!

331
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:54,800
- We took the Interstate!
- I was talking about Christmas dinner.

332
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,920
And what's wrong with my
family's Christmas dinners?

333
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,640
Your family.

334
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,600
Your mother always felt you deserved
more than a used car salesman.

335
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,760
Now that salesman has become
a respected sales manager.

336
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,440
So, I'm sorry, baby,
but screw your mother!

337
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:15,480
- Anything else?
- Your damn brother is a freak too!

338
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,120
He jerks off to gun magazines!

339
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:21,120
That is disgusting! That is
disgusting and that is not fair!

340
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:25,360
- Mikey has had a lot of hard times!
- Poor little Mikey! Poor Mikey!

341
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:27,960
Wht do I have to suffer every time
I talk to the son of a bitch?

342
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,320
- You are just so sensitive!
- I know it's Christmas, Laura.

343
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:35,080
I know it's the season of giving,
but I don't give a shit right now!

344
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,560
I just wanna get
off this goddamn road!

345
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:44,360
- Jesus! Mother of...! Fuck!
- Oh, Frank!

346
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:48,440
It's okay, honey.
We just had a blow-out.

347
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,680
- Okay.
- I'm pregnant.

348
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,960
Marion!

349
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,120
Jesus Christ!

350
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,600
I smoke pot.

351
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:07,000
I'm gonna go change the tire.

352
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:17,360
You handle that wrench
like a whore handles a baby.

353
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:21,160
- Fucking do it yourself, man.
- You watch your mouth, goddamn it.

354
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,520
- All right.
- You want some help?

355
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,400
How is Marion doing?

356
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:33,080
She's pregnant.

357
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:39,120
- How are you?
- Frankly, it's been much for one night.

358
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,600
I'll say.

359
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:46,400
- Where did Richard go?
- He's probably off smoking a joint.

360
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:49,680
That is not funny!
Our son is doing drugs!

361
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,240
Please, Laura.

362
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:56,240
- Can't you see this is a cry for help?
- Christ! It's just a joint, all right?

363
00:34:57,080 --> 00:35:00,520
- Not worse than those pills you take.
- My pills are legal!

364
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:30,000
Pregnant.

365
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:36,480
Man, I hope it's a boy.
What's up, little critter?

366
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,800
I'm your Uncle Dick.

367
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:45,720
That means you'd better
show me some respect, huh?

368
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:49,000
Or I will fuck you up.

369
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,440
Okay.

370
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:58,480
Are you okay, honey-bunny?

371
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:04,280
- Don't you ever call me that again.
- Okay.

372
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:09,480
- Okay, that's fine.
- That's what Brad called me.

373
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:14,880
Uncle Dick. Right on.

374
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,400
Fuck!

375
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,320
I love you.

376
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,120
Jesus!

377
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:10,560
Okay. I'm done. Let's go.

378
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:12,880
Richard, we're going!

379
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:18,960
- It's the car!
- Oh, my God...

380
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,440
Open the door!

381
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:35,280
- Open the door! Open the door!
- Laura! Laura!

382
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:38,240
Let's go back and get the car!

383
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,280
Dad! Dad!

384
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:53,920
Richard! Richard!

385
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:58,920
Come here!
Laura, get in the car now!

386
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:03,280
- Frank...
- Get in, we'll get him!

387
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:09,040
- Faster!
- It doesn't go any faster, Laura!

388
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:11,080
- Where is he?
- I don't know. I can't see him.

389
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,640
The son of a bitch
shut off his lights!

390
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,280
- They are gonna kill him.
- No!

391
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:16,480
- They are gonna kill him!
- No, they won't!

392
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:18,120
- Yes, they are!
- Calm down, mom!

393
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:21,000
He'll be all right!
I'll get him!

394
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:28,280
- It was Richard!
- Shut up! Damn it!

395
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:30,920
It was Richard!

396
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,480
Stop the car! Stop the car!

397
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,960
Please...

398
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,440
My baby!

399
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:49,000
Please...
What did they do to you?

400
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,600
- Mom...
- Come on.

401
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:54,080
Come on, baby. You can wake up.
Come one, baby.

402
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,680
Laura...

403
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:57,840
- Laura...
- What? What?

404
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:01,720
- Mom, he is...
- No! No, no...

405
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:08,360
This is one of his jokes, isn't it?
You're just like your father.

406
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:11,760
Remember the time that
he took me to New Orleans?

407
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:16,360
- We never went to New Orleans.
- 'Course not. You're not his father.

408
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:21,320
- What?
- Richard is not your son.

409
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:25,240
- Mom, what are you talking about?
- She's out of her fucking mind.

410
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:30,240
I am not out of my mind.
Don't you remember Alan Rickson?

411
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:33,480
- Laura...
- What? What?

412
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:37,520
- What did you say?
- You remember Alan Rickson?

413
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:41,080
My baby. I don't wanna go.
I don't wanna go.

414
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:44,280
- Please, let me stay with him.
- Come on.

415
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:47,200
Let me stay...

416
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:54,440
Don't take me from him! Oh, God!
Please, I don't wanna go.

417
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:57,040
Please, Frank...

418
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:44,320
- What are we gonna do?
- We gotta go to the police.

419
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:50,840
How are we gonna go to the police?
We're in the middle of nowhere.

420
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:55,600
- Come on. Let's go, honey.
- We can't leave him here.

421
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:59,040
No, we won't.

422
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:02,720
He was my son.
He goes with us.

423
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,760
What is it?

424
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:21,920
It's what Uncle Mike
wanted for Christmas.

425
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,840
Thank God for the gun freak.

426
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:43,840
Isn't Michael coming?

427
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:46,240
- Michael? Who the hell is Michael?
- It's Richard.

428
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:51,240
His real name is Michael. Because
that is what Alan wanted to call him.

429
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:55,840
- Richard is dead!
- Okay.

430
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,440
Would you like some pie?

431
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:07,800
- It was that sign again.
- How far is this fucking town?

432
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,280
- We've been driving for 100 miles.
- What a wonderful Christmas.

433
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:16,160
I wonder if I should save
some pie for Michael?

434
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,000
- Do you think she's gonna recover?
- I don't know.

435
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:24,160
But she's gonna have to
face reality sooner or later.

436
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:26,720
- What a wonderful Chrismtas.
- God only knows how she will react.

437
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:30,400
- Can't be any worse.
- It can be much worse.

438
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:34,000
Look, I finished the pie.

439
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:38,480
- Could I have a pen, please?
- What for?

440
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:43,840
- I'm gonna do a drawing.
- Good, good. Here, my pen.

441
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:47,480
- You are so beautiful, Marion.
- Jesus!

442
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:53,200
Let's hope there's
a hospital in Marcott.

443
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:58,560
What if we never reach Marcott?
What if she gets us first?

444
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:02,000
- Who?
- The lady in white.

445
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:05,040
- That woman with the baby?
- Yeah, I saw her in the woods...

446
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:07,080
...right after Richard disappeared.
- You saw her?

447
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:11,200
And then I remembered the story
my grandfather used to tell me.

448
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:14,040
Used to creep me out
every time I heard it.

449
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:19,320
Look. I made a drawing of Brad. This
was his leg that was hanging out.

450
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:22,000
- It's for you.
- Okay, Mom.

451
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:24,280
Wipe your face.

452
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:29,720
There was this couple that was
driving home from a wedding...

453
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:32,720
in Rhode Island.
It was night. It was raining.

454
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:36,120
And they saw a little girl
standing by the side of the road.

455
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:39,760
And she was just wandering back
and forth, clutching the school book.

456
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:44,040
They stopped and they let her
get into the back seat...

457
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:48,160
and they tried to talk to her,
but she must have been in shock.

458
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:51,800
They were driving on down the road,
all of a sudden they heard a scream...

459
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,400
coming from the back seat.

460
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:57,080
They slammed on the brakes,
they nearly had an accident.

461
00:43:57,320 --> 00:44:01,360
Miraculously, they didn't go over the
cliff. They turned to the back seat...

462
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:04,120
the little girl had vanished.

463
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:07,600
There was just her school book
there, with her name on it.

464
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:10,640
Barbara Rose.

465
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:13,400
And then they remembered:

466
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:17,920
The entire Rose family had died
in a tragic car accident...

467
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:21,240
right at that cliff,
five years earlier.

468
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:30,640
Come on! Dad, what are you saying?
That that woman is a ghost?

469
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:35,080
Look! We've got potato chips!

470
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:38,520
I'll get them open.
I didn't know we had them.

471
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,840
- Do you want some?
- Mom, don't eat them so fast.

472
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:45,560
- You're gonna make yourself sick.
- I am not.

473
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:51,800
Oh, God! We'd better wake up
from this nightmare pretty soon.

474
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:58,720
Do you feel better, Laura?

475
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:07,600
Dad, who's Alan Rickson?

476
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:10,160
I have no idea.

477
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:17,720
- What was Mom talking about?
- I never heard of any Alan Rickson.

478
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:21,560
She's in shock. She's talking
a whole lot of nonsense.

479
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:24,560
- Why would she do that?
- You tell me.

480
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:26,680
Wow! Look what I found!

481
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:31,320
Mom, put the gun down.
It's dangerous.

482
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:35,680
It's not. It's a toy! It's like
the one Michael used to have.

483
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:40,320
- Laura!
- I was just kidding!

484
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:44,360
Laura, that is a loaded gun.
Put it down.

485
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:49,960
You are just trying to scare me.
I don't wanna play with you anymore.

486
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:52,680
- Bang-bang, you are dead!
- Okay.

487
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:56,000
Okay, sweetheart. You win.

488
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:58,200
I'm dead.

489
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:01,920
- Do something.
- Like what?

490
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:04,440
- You are the shrink.
- Student shrink.

491
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:07,240
- Marion...
- Mom!

492
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:11,280
- Yes, darling.
- We'll play something else now.

493
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,840
Remember when
we used to play house?

494
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:20,200
I don't wanna play that. I wanna
play what Michael and I used to.

495
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:23,960
Laura, this is not a game!
Our son is dead!

496
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:29,120
- No.
- Richard is dead!

497
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:33,240
Dad!

498
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:40,720
Holy shit!
The bitch shot me in the leg!

499
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:44,680
- Is he hurt?
- Mom, go back to the car.

500
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:47,480
- It's gonna be all right.
- Is he gonna die too?

501
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:50,720
Nobody is gonna die anymore, okay?

502
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:53,920
How does it look, Doc?

503
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:56,200
We'll see.

504
00:46:56,760 --> 00:47:00,080
- Hold this. Hold this!
- All right.

505
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:04,680
- I have to get the pellets out.
- Okay.

506
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:07,680
Light on the wound, please.

507
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:14,680
- Have you done this before?
- No, this is my first time.

508
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:17,520
- Shit!
- Light on the wound!

509
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:23,280
Right.

510
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:25,400
- Okay, brace yourself.
- Why?

511
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:27,360
Brace yourself.

512
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:31,880
Oh, God!

513
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,960
That hurt more than the shot!

514
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:39,320
Okay, lift your leg up.

515
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:45,480
All right. All right.
You should be all right now.

516
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,280
- Give me the keys.
- I'll drive.

517
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:58,360
Easy on the bottle there.

518
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:03,680
- You know of a better pain killer?
- Driving isn't helping any.

519
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:05,360
It helps.

520
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:14,800
I don't understand it.

521
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:17,680
We should have passed
a side-road by now.

522
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:21,280
Your grandma's place is
probably miles behind us.

523
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:30,120
That's it!
This must be a military road!

524
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:32,120
You think so?

525
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:35,560
That's why we never see military
trucks. Always on roads isolated!

526
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:39,320
Marcott must be a military base.
That's why it's not even on the map.

527
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:44,840
- I guess so.
- Of course! That's it! That's it!

528
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:22,720
Dad?

529
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:27,680
- Dad!
- It's okay, honey.

530
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:31,000
- I'm here. I'm here.
- Thank God! I thought that...

531
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:34,560
Your leg...

532
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:37,120
- Are you okay?
- That's not so bad.

533
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:40,160
I think we finally got some
good news. Come here.

534
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:45,000
Look. Earlier, I showed
your mother the North Star.

535
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:48,160
It was on our right side.
It still is.

536
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:51,520
That means we've been
headed constantly west.

537
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:55,720
So, if we left the Interstate
somewhere around here...

538
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:57,840
and we headed constantly
west on this road...

539
00:49:58,040 --> 00:50:00,080
the road must go right
straight to the sea.

540
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:04,120
Marcott must be somewhere on
the coast. It makes perfect sense.

541
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:06,240
It must be a naval base.

542
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:10,040
Okay, okay. So how long
until we get there?

543
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:15,240
We have about half a tank of gas,
we covered 150 miles on this road.

544
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:20,200
That leaves us another 40 or 50
miles until we get to the coast.

545
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:22,800
We can reach Marcott
within an hour, tops.

546
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:24,960
You're a genius.

547
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:32,240
But you know, I'm more than a little
concerned about your mother.

548
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:34,920
- Mom?
- You're awake?

549
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:39,560
- I slept like a log.
- How are you feeling?

550
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:44,560
I feel... okay...
considering...

551
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:47,720
Now we have got...

552
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:52,960
to stick together. We have got to
support each other in our grief.

553
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:57,600
Would you like me to drive, darling?

554
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:02,280
- We should reach Marcott soon.
- Oh, good!

555
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:06,480
- You look not very well.
- She's okay.

556
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:13,680
Frank, you know,
you are a wonderful father.

557
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:18,200
And a wonderful husband too.

558
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:23,640
I want you to know that I understand
about you and Sally Schmidt.

559
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:27,600
- What?
- I know the whole thing.

560
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:32,720
I know how you two used to meet
at the Motel 6 on your lunch break.

561
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:38,440
It's okay. I completely understand.
I have never been able to fulfill...

562
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:41,720
your sexual fantasies.
And I want to promise you...

563
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:46,320
that when we get out of here, you can
do anything you want to me, darling.

564
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:50,480
And I mean anything.

565
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:56,080
Anyway, the most important thing...

566
00:51:56,480 --> 00:52:00,120
is that the three of us come out
of this stronger. What do you think?

567
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:04,480
- Not much.
- Good.

568
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:07,560
Now...

569
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:11,000
there's something that has been
bothering me ever since I woke up.

570
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:14,520
- What?
- Who are these people in the woods?

571
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:20,720
Honey, slow down. They are waving.

572
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:24,000
Hi!

573
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:27,640
Oh, my goodness,
why do they look so sad?

574
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:29,960
This is Christmas Eve.

575
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:31,880
Smile!

576
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:35,000
They teach you what to do
in this kind of situation?

577
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:37,600
Not to panic.

578
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:43,680
Frank, do you really need to
suck on that bottle like that?

579
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:48,640
Frank! It's Jeannine!
Quick, stop the car!

580
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:50,720
- Who is Jeannine?
- She's my friend!

581
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:52,800
Who died 20 years ago.

582
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,880
- And what exactly is your point?
- She's dead.

583
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:58,120
- So?
- So drop it!

584
00:52:58,360 --> 00:53:03,680
If the dead are alive, maybe
we should check out Richard.

585
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:07,240
- Are you crazy?
- Think he is comfortable back there?

586
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:10,680
Mom, if he was alive, don't
you think we would here him?

587
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:13,000
Your brother was burned alive.
How could he talk?

588
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:14,800
- Shut up, Laura!
- Easy, dad.

589
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,880
- Okay.
- She's driving me crazy.

590
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:21,840
- Could I go see Jeannine now?
- No, you can't!

591
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:24,680
- Yes, I can.
- No, you can't!

592
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:27,760
- Yes, I can.
- No, you...

593
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:30,720
I'm gonna go now.

594
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:35,920
Oh, my God! Dad, stop the car!

595
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:41,320
- Mom!
- Laura! Laura!

596
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:44,080
- Mom!
- Laura!

597
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:46,240
Mom!

598
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:49,680
Oh, God! God! Laura!

599
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:03,800
- Where the hell did she go?
- Mom?

600
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:07,760
Mom!

601
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:11,160
- Maybe she ran away.
- Oh, Marion...

602
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:14,720
- Maybe she went into the woods.
- Marion, I'm going 60!

603
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:17,960
- She would have broken her neck!
- Then where is she?

604
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:20,560
Maybe the lady got her.

605
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:25,280
It's the black car.

606
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:29,640
You son of a bitch. I'm gonna
blow that bastard's head off.

607
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:36,360
- Marion, where's the ammo?
- It's here. I hid it from mom.

608
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:38,400
Come on!

609
00:54:57,080 --> 00:54:59,320
I got him!

610
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:11,920
- Mom!
- Laura.

611
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:15,360
- Thank God.
- Mom, are you all right?

612
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:19,120
I'm okay. My head hurts a little
but I'm fine.

613
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:21,000
Sweetheart.

614
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:24,480
Honey, honey.
You got something on your...

615
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:27,440
Oh, my God! Oh, God!

616
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:30,320
- Something wrong with my hair?
- Oh, God!

617
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:41,000
Alan!

618
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:42,760
- Finally!
- No! Stop!

619
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:46,640
- Alan!
- Stop! Stop!

620
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:51,440
Laura...

621
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:53,440
- Daddy?
- Laura...

622
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:56,960
I made the cheerleading squad.

623
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:01,920
This is the happiest day
of my life.

624
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:16,960
Laura...

625
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:44,560
Dad! Dad!

626
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:47,480
Give me that gun!
Stop it, dad! Stop it!

627
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:50,160
- You bastard! Stop it!
- Marion...

628
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:55,160
I'm gonna have a baby. You can't
leave us. You can't leave us.

629
00:56:55,400 --> 00:57:00,040
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- I've already lost my mother...

630
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:04,480
and my brother and my boyfriend.
I don't wanna lose you.

631
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:09,440
- I don't wanna lose you.
- She's gonna get us all anyway.

632
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:14,800
No. No one is gonna get us,
as long as we keep moving.

633
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:19,720
Every time we've stopped, someone's
gotten killed. We have to keep driving.

634
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:22,560
We are going to Marcott.

635
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:36,640
Let's put your mother in the car.

636
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:52,960
- You got a cigarette?
- In my coat.

637
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:14,240
Alan Rickson was a friend of mine,
back in Detroit.

638
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:18,800
You don't have to say anything, Dad.

639
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:23,800
Then one day he came to me
for some advice.

640
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:29,720
He said that he was
in love with a woman.

641
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:33,160
Didn't mention her name.

642
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:37,720
He said that she was married
and that she loved him too.

643
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:43,520
And he wanted to know
what he should do about it.

644
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:48,920
And I remember what
I said to him...

645
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:53,120
"You only live once, buddy.
Go for it.

646
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:59,440
Just go. You go and you see her,
and if she loves you...

647
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:02,760
she will leave her husband
and she will go with you."

648
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:09,880
- I'm sorry, Dad.
- Only talked to him once after that.

649
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:16,240
He said the woman had decided she
didn't want to leave her husband.

650
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:21,720
She already had a kid.

651
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:26,080
A little girl.

652
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:31,080
She didn't want to lose her.

653
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:38,600
Last time I ever saw Alan.

654
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:43,920
Always wondered
why he never kept in touch.

655
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:55,480
Why did you do that?

656
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:58,200
If you are scared,
alcohol will only make it worse.

657
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:02,560
- You think I'm scared?
- You don't need to pretend.

658
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:06,240
- It's okay.
- No, it's not.

659
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:09,480
Have you looked at
the odometer lately?

660
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:12,560
We've driven 60 miles since
the last time we checked the map.

661
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:14,280
I know.

662
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:17,240
- We should have reached the coast.
- I know.

663
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:20,400
Maybe I miscalculated a little bit.

664
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:22,360
Maybe.

665
01:00:22,560 --> 01:00:24,800
Maybe the North Star
doesn't indicate north.

666
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:28,400
Maybe the map maker was drunk.
Maybe the moon's made out of cheese.

667
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:32,600
Who knows? Everything is so
fucked up on this goddamn road!

668
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:46,400
After all, we don't have to drive
to get to Marcott.

669
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:50,440
- Maybe there's another way out.
- Like what, dad? Flying?

670
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:53,600
No. Walking.

671
01:00:57,120 --> 01:00:58,440
Through the woods.

672
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:02,000
- This is insane.
- Agreed. Agreed.

673
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:05,360
- You ready?
- We should at least wait until sunrise.

674
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:09,200
Remember what you said? Every time
we stopped, somebody died.

675
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:11,680
Let's keep moving.

676
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,600
Did you hear that?

677
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:36,120
- Of course I heard that.
- What is it?

678
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:38,360
I don't know. We're in the woods,
Dad. It could be anything.

679
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:40,960
A branch falling, a rat or something,
maybe a bird.

680
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:46,320
Remember what Laura said
about all the faces in the forest?

681
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:52,080
Are there any ghosts
in the woods tonight?

682
01:01:57,400 --> 01:02:00,000
- Come on, I'm waiting!
- Don't...

683
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:04,440
ever, ever do that again.
You hear me?

684
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:08,960
- What is the matter with you?
- We shouldn't have left the car.

685
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:11,440
That's what's the matter with me!

686
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:15,400
The more distance we put between us
and the road, the better off we'll be.

687
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:18,120
Goddamn! Shit!

688
01:02:18,320 --> 01:02:19,800
Shit! Shit!

689
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,480
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, just dandy.

690
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:27,320
- What the hell is that?
- You found us a fence!

691
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:32,520
A fence. Good, good.

692
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:36,440
There must be a farm
on the other side. It's not that tight.

693
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:39,760
I'll hold it up.
You crawl under. Go on.

694
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:42,800
- Now you hold it for me.
- Okay.

695
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:53,760
Dad! Look!

696
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:56,960
- Hello!
- Hello!

697
01:02:57,160 --> 01:02:58,240
Hello!

698
01:02:58,440 --> 01:03:00,920
We're here! We're here!

699
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:06,960
No!

700
01:03:07,480 --> 01:03:10,000
No, it can't be!

701
01:03:11,240 --> 01:03:13,680
How can it be? How can...

702
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:15,840
How can it be?

703
01:03:16,080 --> 01:03:18,320
- Maybe we got lost.
- Lf we were lost...

704
01:03:18,520 --> 01:03:21,000
we would have come out
at the same side of the road.

705
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:22,920
- Somebody is fucking with us.
- Calm down.

706
01:03:23,120 --> 01:03:26,760
I don't wanna calm down!
I want this shit to stop!

707
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:35,800
- It's still locked.
- So what?

708
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:40,040
So who turned on the lights?
Who turned them on?

709
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:56,320
Laura?

710
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:06,000
- I'm not getting back in that car.
- Me neither.

711
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:10,960
What are you writing?

712
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:15,280
Things I wanna do
when this is over.

713
01:04:17,080 --> 01:04:19,440
So?

714
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:25,880
Do you want me to help you?

715
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:31,840
- What about playing bridge?
- How old do you think I am?

716
01:04:32,040 --> 01:04:34,880
I wanna do something... cool.

717
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:39,480
I wanna buy an Atari, a computer,
a bunch of videogames.

718
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:43,000
If you wanna do something cool,
then I'd go for the PlayStation.

719
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:45,760
What's that?

720
01:04:46,680 --> 01:04:49,520
Never mind.
Atari is cooler anyway.

721
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:56,960
Maybe buy some of those
Marilyn Bronson CDs.

722
01:04:57,640 --> 01:04:59,640
Manson.

723
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:16,960
- What did you write?
- That's none of your business.

724
01:05:23,360 --> 01:05:25,240
Stop!

725
01:05:27,640 --> 01:05:30,320
- What's going on?
- I knew it.

726
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:34,720
Somebody is playing with us.
That's the same cabin as before.

727
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:38,200
There's probably 100 ranger stations
on this road. It can't be the same one.

728
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:41,200
No, it can't be. But it is.

729
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:52,080
- Oh, shit! Go get the flashlight.
- No.

730
01:05:52,280 --> 01:05:54,800
Go get the flashlight!

731
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:56,600
Marion?

732
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:05,880
What are you doing?

733
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:07,760
Stop it! Stop it!

734
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:10,960
- There's someone in here! I know it!
- Dad, stop it!

735
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:21,720
We are damned.

736
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:32,080
Dad, come on.

737
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:36,200
No road goes on forever.

738
01:07:42,680 --> 01:07:45,080
Where the fog come from?

739
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:47,880
- There's no fog, dad.
- No fog?

740
01:07:48,120 --> 01:07:51,920
Somebody needs to pay a visit to
Dr. Sacks to get her eyes checked.

741
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:56,280
- Where's the whiskey?
- I threw it away, remember?

742
01:07:56,480 --> 01:07:58,120
What?

743
01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:03,600
You threw away my whiskey?
My whiskey? Ungrateful little brat.

744
01:08:03,800 --> 01:08:06,400
- Dad, calm down.
- You think because I'm weak...

745
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:09,440
...you can start messing with me?
- Dad, listen to me.

746
01:08:11,240 --> 01:08:13,800
What are you doing?

747
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:17,640
That'll teach you to think twice
before you touch my booze.

748
01:08:17,840 --> 01:08:19,040
Dad, please. Please.

749
01:08:19,280 --> 01:08:21,080
Shut up! Shut up!

750
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:24,520
God damn you!

751
01:08:36,160 --> 01:08:38,000
Marion?

752
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:40,320
Marion?

753
01:08:40,520 --> 01:08:44,840
Marion? My baby!
Oh, God, what did I do?

754
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:48,360
What did I do?

755
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:56,480
Oh, my baby...

756
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:20,280
So, you've come for her, huh?

757
01:09:20,480 --> 01:09:23,120
Well, you'll have to kill me first,
you bitch!

758
01:09:24,440 --> 01:09:27,240
Why us, huh? Why?

759
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:32,120
What did we ever do to you?
All we wanted was a nice Christmas.

760
01:09:33,080 --> 01:09:37,000
Is that too much to ask,
to have a nice Christmas?

761
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:40,160
Come on out!
Where are you hiding?

762
01:09:40,840 --> 01:09:43,160
Come on! I'll give you a taste
of your own medicine, you bitch!

763
01:09:43,400 --> 01:09:45,160
I'll send you right straight back...

764
01:10:05,560 --> 01:10:07,560
Dad? Dad?

765
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:13,200
He is dead.

766
01:10:17,080 --> 01:10:20,600
- He is dead!
- Oh, God!

767
01:10:21,640 --> 01:10:23,480
Get started!

768
01:10:45,160 --> 01:10:48,000
Come on. Come on!

769
01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:50,960
Start! Come on!

770
01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:37,040
Let's end it!

771
01:11:41,320 --> 01:11:43,680
Come on!

772
01:11:44,520 --> 01:11:50,320
Stop playing with me!
Please! Please!

773
01:12:55,240 --> 01:12:58,160
He's not here for you!

774
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:35,560
Dad!

775
01:13:44,240 --> 01:13:47,320
Don't try to talk.
Everything is gonna be okay now.

776
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:50,560
- Just try to get some rest, okay?
- I'm pregnant.

777
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:52,960
It's all right, Marion.
We know.

778
01:13:53,160 --> 01:13:55,880
Both of you are gonna be fine.

779
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:10,480
- How is she?
- Are you a member of the family?

780
01:14:10,680 --> 01:14:13,480
No, I'm the one who found them.
I reported the accident.

781
01:14:13,680 --> 01:14:18,040
She was lucky, she was
thrown out of the car.

782
01:14:18,240 --> 01:14:21,600
Been in a coma for a few hours, but
she's gonna be fine. A few broken...

783
01:14:21,800 --> 01:14:25,680
...ribs and a concussion.
- But the others died.

784
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:38,560
- Do they know what happened?
- According to the police...

785
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:43,840
father must have fallen asleep
and crashed into an oncoming car.

786
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:48,200
- A woman and her baby.
- They died too.

787
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:09,480
Well...

788
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:15,760
thank you. Thank you for
what you did. Doctor...

789
01:15:16,520 --> 01:15:20,200
- Marcott. Helen Marcott.
- Thank you, Doctor Marcott.

790
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:30,040
Not again.

791
01:15:32,760 --> 01:15:34,720
Shit.

792
01:15:36,320 --> 01:15:37,360
Hey!

793
01:15:39,240 --> 01:15:41,480
- Nice car.
- Yeah, I'm a collector.

794
01:15:41,680 --> 01:15:45,200
- Can I give you a lift?
- Why not?

795
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:30,800
Must have been a messy one.
Broken glass everywhere.

796
01:16:32,040 --> 01:16:34,920
I should be at home
stuffing myself today.

797
01:16:35,120 --> 01:16:37,160
So should they.

798
01:16:47,320 --> 01:16:49,320
Did you drop this?

799
01:16:49,560 --> 01:16:52,040
No, what have you got there?

800
01:16:53,040 --> 01:17:03,040
