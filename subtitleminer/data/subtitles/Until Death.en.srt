1
00:01:14,107 --> 00:01:16,234
Plainclothes officers have arrived
on the scene.

2
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:18,843
- Plainclothes are here on the scene.
- Roger.

3
00:01:26,052 --> 00:01:28,816
Hey, Stowe, check out the rookie.

4
00:01:29,556 --> 00:01:31,615
Why don't you just
smoke the damn thing...

5
00:01:31,791 --> 00:01:33,349
...if it'll make you calm down?

6
00:01:33,526 --> 00:01:35,255
Thought you were quitting.

7
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:38,788
Where did we get
this fucking guy, anyway?

8
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:43,392
Some house for poor teenagers
who wanna play Cops and Robbers?

9
00:01:45,338 --> 00:01:47,033
I'm so sorry.
I'm in New Orleans.

10
00:01:47,207 --> 00:01:49,266
Watch the guy on Royal and Peters.

11
00:02:01,187 --> 00:02:03,087
Here we go.

12
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,491
She looks hot.

13
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:17,869
She cleans up very well, huh?

14
00:02:18,037 --> 00:02:19,026
That's a 10-4.

15
00:02:19,205 --> 00:02:22,231
- We're going inside.
- Got that, Delta.

16
00:02:47,967 --> 00:02:50,492
The target, Callahan,
has arrived at the building.

17
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,934
I repeat, has arrived at the building.

18
00:02:55,909 --> 00:02:57,570
We're on.

19
00:02:58,811 --> 00:03:01,871
Check, Detective Anthony Stowe,
4358.

20
00:03:02,048 --> 00:03:05,176
Lead narcotics officer,
801 Royal Street.

21
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:07,911
The time, 2024.

22
00:03:08,087 --> 00:03:11,545
Target, Gabriel Callahan.
He's in the structure.

23
00:03:11,724 --> 00:03:16,058
And our team on the inside
is led by Special Agent Ronson.

24
00:03:19,732 --> 00:03:23,463
Well, it's finally nice to meet you.
I'm Mary.

25
00:03:23,636 --> 00:03:26,730
And this is my boyfriend, Joe.

26
00:03:27,173 --> 00:03:29,038
Nice jacket.

27
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:31,943
- What?
- That's a nice jacket.

28
00:03:32,612 --> 00:03:35,877
It's all there. I promise.

29
00:03:39,485 --> 00:03:42,454
Secret combination, Miss Johnson?

30
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:44,314
Six-six-six.

31
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:47,891
- I bet you're a pretty high roller, huh?
- Yeah, look-

32
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:56,000
- How much to get rid of you?
- Oh, if you have a donation...

33
00:03:56,169 --> 00:03:58,160
- No, no, no.
- ... I'd be willing to receive.

34
00:03:58,805 --> 00:03:59,794
Give me the wallet.

35
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:11,147
Now it's our turn.

36
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:14,242
Wait.

37
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:26,459
Come on.

38
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:28,156
Where's our stuff?

39
00:04:28,334 --> 00:04:29,699
A deal's a deal, right?

40
00:04:29,869 --> 00:04:31,496
You got our end.

41
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:33,997
Tell your boy to relax.

42
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:39,342
You just bought yourself
a $400 radio.

43
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,014
Show me some skin.

44
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:47,810
You want to see me undress?

45
00:04:49,856 --> 00:04:51,790
What are you,
some kind of pervert?

46
00:04:52,425 --> 00:04:54,052
Yeah.

47
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:57,193
I'm some kind of pervert...

48
00:04:57,363 --> 00:05:00,799
...and I wanna see everything.

49
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:04,298
- Lost Callahan now, I've lost him.
- I'm a normal guy.

50
00:05:05,705 --> 00:05:09,368
See this gun? Beat it.
Get out of here.

51
00:05:11,077 --> 00:05:12,567
We're busted.

52
00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:14,844
What the hell is Stowe doing?

53
00:05:15,014 --> 00:05:16,072
I can't hear anything.

54
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:17,508
Hey!

55
00:05:19,185 --> 00:05:20,846
Take that guy in now!

56
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:23,479
Come on, asshole, get down!

57
00:05:35,535 --> 00:05:36,934
Come on, come on, hurry up!

58
00:06:05,832 --> 00:06:07,129
Don't move!

59
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:35,220
Police!

60
00:06:37,597 --> 00:06:39,064
Stowe.

61
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:41,662
- No, no, no.
- Medics! Now!

62
00:06:42,802 --> 00:06:45,635
Ross here. Get us a medic.

63
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:08,754
Shit, Stowe. You blew it.

64
00:07:09,862 --> 00:07:11,261
Shit!

65
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:16,761
What the hell happened?
Why'd you bolt so early back there?

66
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:19,029
Callahan only likes blonds.

67
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,695
You think it's gonna end like this?

68
00:07:43,863 --> 00:07:46,263
That easy and simple?

69
00:07:46,432 --> 00:07:50,300
After 10 years, you're gonna send
some cheap slut in there to fool me?

70
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,495
Thought I'd give them a show?

71
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:55,163
I gave you a show, partner.

72
00:07:55,341 --> 00:07:59,107
How long are you gonna keep up
this "good cop" charade?

73
00:07:59,278 --> 00:08:00,836
Forever.

74
00:08:01,013 --> 00:08:03,743
It's as fake as you are.

75
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:07,351
Next time, send in your wife.

76
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:12,619
She's more my type,
but you already know that, right?

77
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:18,926
Hey, hey, hey!

78
00:08:19,098 --> 00:08:22,226
Hey, hey, it wasn't my fault.
The comm went down, I couldn't hear!

79
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:23,459
- Chill.
- Come on.

80
00:08:23,636 --> 00:08:25,126
It wasn't his fault, Stowe.

81
00:08:25,304 --> 00:08:29,536
We lost two good people today.
Better than you. Because of you.

82
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:31,336
Fuck you.

83
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:47,382
I know Callahan was your partner,
Stowe. We all know that.

84
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:51,860
But you gotta realize
I got two dead cops I gotta explain...

85
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:56,297
...and you can't keep letting
your emotions make bad judgments.

86
00:08:56,469 --> 00:09:00,269
Your nine lives
seem to be running out.

87
00:09:01,674 --> 00:09:04,905
That's fine with me.
I've had a good run.

88
00:09:05,845 --> 00:09:07,813
Go home, Stowe.

89
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:09,408
Clean yourself up.

90
00:09:15,821 --> 00:09:18,346
Send a prowler
to watch Valerie tonight.

91
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:22,091
He doesn't care
about your wife, Stowe.

92
00:09:22,261 --> 00:09:25,958
He doesn't even care about you.
He's just fucking with you.

93
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,625
You're chasing him.

94
00:09:28,801 --> 00:09:31,065
He's not chasing you.

95
00:09:31,504 --> 00:09:32,562
Go home.

96
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:35,263
What happened
to the camera on Tommy?

97
00:09:36,442 --> 00:09:38,171
Disappeared as well.

98
00:09:39,545 --> 00:09:43,140
And you might wanna steer clear
of Van Huffel.

99
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:45,409
Him and Ronson
just got engaged last week.

100
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,746
We had a little party.

101
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,013
You weren't around.

102
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:49,709
What were you doing
on Royal Street today?

103
00:10:50,282 --> 00:10:52,079
Jerkoff.

104
00:10:54,353 --> 00:10:56,048
Tell me the truth.

105
00:10:56,222 --> 00:10:58,053
Not a bullshit lie.

106
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:19,504
What's a punk kid like you
doing in the Quarter, huh?

107
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:23,872
What the fuck, man?

108
00:11:33,225 --> 00:11:36,422
I was picking up my mom.

109
00:12:05,991 --> 00:12:06,980
Hello?

110
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:09,218
Hey, Jane, it's Val.
Is he there yet?

111
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:10,487
He's right here.

112
00:12:12,498 --> 00:12:13,658
Your wife.

113
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:17,891
Hello.

114
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:20,004
I've been trying
to get hold of you all day.

115
00:12:20,172 --> 00:12:22,504
It's been a bad day.
What do you want?

116
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:28,441
I want you to ask me that again
in a nicer tone.

117
00:12:28,614 --> 00:12:30,445
Try using some bigger words.

118
00:12:30,616 --> 00:12:32,777
Valerie, what the fuck do you want?

119
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,449
That's what I'm talking about.

120
00:12:36,622 --> 00:12:40,114
Next time, why don't we try using
some five-letter words?

121
00:12:40,292 --> 00:12:42,783
Just think where you could be
this time next week.

122
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:44,429
What is it?

123
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:48,327
I wanted to make sure you're
picking me up for dinner tonight.

124
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:50,935
Tonight's not a good night.

125
00:12:51,137 --> 00:12:52,764
It's important, Tony.

126
00:12:54,473 --> 00:12:55,599
Hold on.

127
00:12:58,744 --> 00:13:02,680
- What?
- How do I explain what happened?

128
00:13:02,848 --> 00:13:05,316
In English.
You went to school, right?

129
00:13:09,021 --> 00:13:10,113
It's my husband.

130
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,750
Well, it's up to you.

131
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:16,655
Tell me where.

132
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:19,491
Karaoke bar off Frenchman.

133
00:13:24,937 --> 00:13:27,303
Hey, how you doing?

134
00:13:30,242 --> 00:13:34,941
Remember last week I covered for
you, kept your name on that booking?

135
00:13:35,114 --> 00:13:36,911
Well, I need the favor returned.

136
00:13:37,116 --> 00:13:38,981
You picked up a kid
from Jackson Square...

137
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:41,585
...with a bit of pot. Nothing dealable.

138
00:13:41,887 --> 00:13:44,720
Kid's my nephew. He's a good kid.

139
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:47,623
A pot dealer.

140
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:50,985
That sounds like a good kid to me.

141
00:13:55,267 --> 00:13:57,030
What do you want?

142
00:13:59,071 --> 00:14:00,936
I need you to help me out here.

143
00:14:01,106 --> 00:14:05,440
He won't be able to go to college if that
evidence sticks around, you know?

144
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:09,104
I'll straighten him out,
don't you worry.

145
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:12,714
I'd do the same for you.

146
00:14:34,273 --> 00:14:35,797
Walter Curry?

147
00:14:35,975 --> 00:14:37,340
Yeah.

148
00:14:38,077 --> 00:14:41,205
He asked me
to make some evidence disappear.

149
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,779
Grass.

150
00:14:42,948 --> 00:14:44,882
Just now, in the bathroom.

151
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:48,012
That's a serious accusation.

152
00:14:48,654 --> 00:14:50,212
I know.

153
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:09,439
I'll take care of the funeral.

154
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:12,975
Let him know.

155
00:15:17,283 --> 00:15:19,114
You sent her in?

156
00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:21,412
You sent her in alone, huh?

157
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:24,715
No fucking backup, no eyes,
and you, huh?

158
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:28,685
You just go in there
guns blazing, right?

159
00:15:31,397 --> 00:15:33,729
You fucking coward.

160
00:15:46,512 --> 00:15:47,843
Knock it off, man!

161
00:15:51,183 --> 00:15:53,310
- Come on, fellas.
- Hey, they're all at it.

162
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:00,657
- Damn.
- She was not alone.

163
00:16:01,093 --> 00:16:03,527
She was undercover.
She had a partner.

164
00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:07,460
Now, if you really cared for her,
you would have taken Tommy's place.

165
00:16:10,035 --> 00:16:12,560
And been there with her.
Not at your desk.

166
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:16,301
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you, man!

167
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:44,530
- Double, please.
- Johnnie Red?

168
00:16:44,703 --> 00:16:46,603
Black tonight.

169
00:16:46,972 --> 00:16:49,497
I'm working tonight, Stowe.

170
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:52,576
Tomorrow night. I promise.

171
00:16:53,112 --> 00:16:54,739
My treat.

172
00:16:55,814 --> 00:16:57,406
Okay.

173
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:10,086
There you go, Stowe.

174
00:17:10,262 --> 00:17:11,854
Thanks.

175
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:25,173
Scotch is for alcoholics.

176
00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:26,538
And my dad.

177
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:29,180
But you don't look like an alcoholic.

178
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:32,712
On second thought-

179
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,785
What do you want to drink?

180
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:36,380
It's on me.

181
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:38,489
Whatever you're having.

182
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:56,438
Are you working tonight?

183
00:17:56,608 --> 00:17:58,337
Are you?

184
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:06,181
Come here.

185
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:10,417
I'll make you a deal.
I won't charge you...

186
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:12,819
...if you won't charge me.

187
00:18:28,407 --> 00:18:31,808
God...
I don't care if you're a fucking cop.

188
00:18:33,645 --> 00:18:36,273
You're not a fucking human being.

189
00:19:00,772 --> 00:19:03,172
Hey, buddy, you can't park here.

190
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:04,673
I'm a cop.

191
00:19:04,843 --> 00:19:07,368
Feel free to have me towed.

192
00:19:14,753 --> 00:19:18,712
Let's welcome the singing couple.

193
00:19:41,747 --> 00:19:43,442
I'm sorry.

194
00:19:50,622 --> 00:19:52,886
Do you remember this place?

195
00:19:56,161 --> 00:19:58,186
Our first date, Anthony.

196
00:19:59,565 --> 00:20:01,556
What was our song?

197
00:20:01,934 --> 00:20:03,492
Our song?

198
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:05,899
You at least must remember this.

199
00:20:06,071 --> 00:20:07,732
Tell me.

200
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:12,434
I'm not gonna tell you,
that's the point.

201
00:20:15,614 --> 00:20:18,481
I went to the doctor this morning,
Anthony.

202
00:20:20,085 --> 00:20:21,916
You okay?

203
00:20:25,324 --> 00:20:26,882
I'm pregnant.

204
00:20:31,597 --> 00:20:33,963
How could you forget to...?

205
00:20:36,368 --> 00:20:38,427
You fucking crazy, or what?

206
00:20:39,438 --> 00:20:41,099
The baby isn't yours.

207
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:56,453
You fucked him.

208
00:20:56,622 --> 00:20:59,750
You fucked Callahan, right?

209
00:21:02,027 --> 00:21:03,426
You're sick.

210
00:21:06,064 --> 00:21:09,090
Don't ever talk to me again.

211
00:21:12,638 --> 00:21:16,005
Don't try to fuck the valet
on your way out!

212
00:21:18,377 --> 00:21:20,277
Oh, fuck.

213
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:29,714
Yo, almost ready, man.

214
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,122
We got another call coming in.

215
00:21:39,331 --> 00:21:41,162
Bad luck, buddy.

216
00:21:50,042 --> 00:21:51,703
Come on, asshole!

217
00:23:46,324 --> 00:23:47,416
Three days at the most.

218
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:50,254
Just trying to get my coat.
That's all I was trying to do.

219
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:53,057
- Fucking shit!
- Walt!

220
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:56,461
Walt's drunk.

221
00:23:56,635 --> 00:23:58,865
He won't turn over his gun
or his badge.

222
00:23:59,037 --> 00:24:01,369
He wants to speak to you.

223
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:07,478
- Give me your vest.
- Shit!

224
00:24:08,246 --> 00:24:09,838
Fuck!

225
00:24:13,985 --> 00:24:16,146
Clean shit! Look at it, get it done!

226
00:24:16,321 --> 00:24:19,085
Gotta clean all this shit, all of it!

227
00:24:19,257 --> 00:24:20,986
God! Come on.

228
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:24,424
One favor, and it's all gone.

229
00:24:35,707 --> 00:24:37,038
You come to me...

230
00:24:37,209 --> 00:24:39,575
...pointing a gun at me.

231
00:24:39,744 --> 00:24:43,908
I've known you for 15 years,
and you point a gun at me.

232
00:24:48,286 --> 00:24:51,722
This place is a shithole. Literally.

233
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:55,348
Call the police force
a disciplinary force?

234
00:24:55,527 --> 00:24:56,994
Shit and piss everywhere.

235
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:59,460
You know what I mean.

236
00:25:01,099 --> 00:25:05,035
You got a gun
and a bulletproof vest.

237
00:25:05,203 --> 00:25:08,661
Always a fucking guy
with a bulletproof vest.

238
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:11,331
You don't trust yourself,
do you, Stowe?

239
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:12,704
Anyway...

240
00:25:13,745 --> 00:25:16,145
You think I'm gonna shoot you?

241
00:25:17,249 --> 00:25:20,150
You think I wouldn't aim
for your head?

242
00:25:34,666 --> 00:25:36,793
I was a cop for 21 years.

243
00:25:36,968 --> 00:25:39,766
Didn't once wear a bulletproof vest.

244
00:25:41,673 --> 00:25:43,300
Never even killed anyone.

245
00:25:43,475 --> 00:25:45,033
Only drew my gun twice.

246
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:49,677
It was a perfect record.

247
00:25:50,015 --> 00:25:51,744
Till yesterday.

248
00:25:52,517 --> 00:25:54,007
Because of you...

249
00:25:54,185 --> 00:25:57,120
...because of a favor,
I lost my pension.

250
00:25:57,289 --> 00:26:01,658
Gonna retire next month,
and now I'm gone with nothing.

251
00:26:01,826 --> 00:26:04,294
You turn tail on Callahan,
that's fine.

252
00:26:04,462 --> 00:26:07,795
He's a dealer, scumbag, murderer,
always was.

253
00:26:07,966 --> 00:26:09,866
You rat on me...

254
00:26:10,035 --> 00:26:12,094
...fuck you for that!

255
00:26:12,938 --> 00:26:16,101
You're not the only one who can
bust a cop, but the only one that will.

256
00:26:16,274 --> 00:26:18,469
And I can smell
the booze and H from here.

257
00:26:18,643 --> 00:26:22,306
You're the fucking dinosaur, not me!

258
00:26:25,784 --> 00:26:27,649
You deserve it.

259
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:33,614
- Yeah, yeah, all right.
- Okay, let's go.

260
00:26:33,792 --> 00:26:35,987
- Sorry, Walt.
- Yeah, good work, boys.

261
00:26:43,335 --> 00:26:44,324
Hey, junkie.

262
00:26:45,036 --> 00:26:47,004
Gentlemen.

263
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:51,705
Don't even think about it.

264
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:02,484
This is hot intel.

265
00:27:02,654 --> 00:27:04,747
And I don't have an address.

266
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:08,024
Run with it. You know what to do.

267
00:27:08,393 --> 00:27:10,020
Now, Larenz Brighton.

268
00:27:10,195 --> 00:27:14,188
He's a security guard
for a company called ISC.

269
00:27:14,366 --> 00:27:18,325
And we tracked an e-mail
from Callahan to this guy.

270
00:27:18,503 --> 00:27:21,199
And Surveillance, like you asked...

271
00:27:21,373 --> 00:27:23,739
...lifted this image of Callahan.

272
00:27:24,175 --> 00:27:26,143
I want you to get on it.

273
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:28,472
And take Serge with you.

274
00:27:39,424 --> 00:27:41,392
Stowe, where are you?

275
00:27:41,559 --> 00:27:42,685
Come in, Stowe.

276
00:27:43,628 --> 00:27:45,926
I know you're there, Stowe.

277
00:28:10,221 --> 00:28:15,090
- You've skipped school?
- It's Martin Luther King, Jr. Day.

278
00:28:16,928 --> 00:28:19,089
Have you seen these faces?

279
00:28:19,297 --> 00:28:23,233
Yeah, I've seen him. Few blocks
from here, near Frenchman Street.

280
00:28:24,135 --> 00:28:25,625
What about this guy?

281
00:28:25,804 --> 00:28:27,294
No.

282
00:28:28,073 --> 00:28:31,372
- Hey, get in.
- No, thanks, man.

283
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:33,875
Hey, hey. Get in.

284
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:35,512
You don't have a choice.

285
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:56,289
- So that's where he's staying, huh?
- Yeah, in that block.

286
00:28:58,169 --> 00:29:00,933
If you see this guy, call me.

287
00:29:10,448 --> 00:29:12,279
You serious?

288
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:17,646
All right, thanks.

289
00:29:21,626 --> 00:29:23,321
Thanks, man.

290
00:29:26,564 --> 00:29:29,624
Damn it, Stowe,
I'm not gonna sit out here all day.

291
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:35,261
Shit.

292
00:29:50,188 --> 00:29:52,452
Larenz Brighton, open the door.

293
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:54,182
Police.

294
00:29:57,929 --> 00:29:59,191
What do you want?

295
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:01,625
I want to talk to Larenz, miss.

296
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,234
- He's not here.
- I know he is.

297
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:09,136
Do you have a warrant?

298
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:11,172
Yes, as a matter of fact, I do.

299
00:30:17,515 --> 00:30:19,710
Larenz, come out.

300
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:21,979
With your hands up.

301
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:24,485
I just wanna talk to you.

302
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:30,354
Miss, can you convince your husband
to come out?

303
00:30:35,934 --> 00:30:37,868
Okay, then.

304
00:30:38,036 --> 00:30:41,005
Let's go for a walk
down to the station.

305
00:31:21,112 --> 00:31:23,546
Next time you want to sneak up
on someone...

306
00:31:25,083 --> 00:31:26,141
...check the reflection.

307
00:31:30,121 --> 00:31:31,110
Sit down.

308
00:31:36,461 --> 00:31:40,261
I'm starved.
All this excitement makes me hungry.

309
00:31:41,633 --> 00:31:43,191
Don't be shy.

310
00:31:44,769 --> 00:31:45,793
Dig in.

311
00:31:46,204 --> 00:31:48,138
I'm not hungry.

312
00:31:50,842 --> 00:31:51,900
Where do you work?

313
00:31:52,477 --> 00:31:54,069
ISC.

314
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:55,337
I'm in Dispatch.

315
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:59,410
Nice apartment.
You must have a strong union.

316
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:01,844
What do you want?

317
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,117
I need information.

318
00:32:04,289 --> 00:32:06,621
And I'm a human lie detector.

319
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:09,120
So don't even try to lie to me.

320
00:32:10,862 --> 00:32:12,921
Talk to me about Callahan.

321
00:32:13,398 --> 00:32:15,593
I don't know anyone
named Callahan.

322
00:32:19,637 --> 00:32:21,537
You broke the first rule already.

323
00:32:21,706 --> 00:32:23,105
Let's start again.

324
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:25,105
I'm telling you the truth.

325
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:26,971
I don't know
who you're talking about.

326
00:32:27,145 --> 00:32:30,205
Where were you when the heist
went down on Jackson Square?

327
00:32:31,149 --> 00:32:33,276
I didn't hear about it.

328
00:32:33,918 --> 00:32:35,112
I was at work.

329
00:32:37,755 --> 00:32:41,122
You were at work during something
you don't know about?

330
00:32:44,662 --> 00:32:46,357
Strange.

331
00:32:46,531 --> 00:32:48,465
Strange to me.

332
00:32:48,766 --> 00:32:49,858
I didn't hear about it.

333
00:32:50,902 --> 00:32:52,494
No!

334
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:55,002
- Listen, there is a gun in your mouth.
- No, no, no!

335
00:32:55,173 --> 00:32:58,301
I might not be able
to understand you clearly.

336
00:32:58,476 --> 00:33:01,172
So nod your head if you want to live.

337
00:33:11,289 --> 00:33:12,847
Where is Callahan?

338
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:14,552
I don't know.

339
00:33:16,027 --> 00:33:18,655
I'm a wheelman from time to time.
A lookout.

340
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,661
I'm not part of the plan.

341
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:22,993
I don't deal directly with Callahan.

342
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:26,000
He never calls me.
It's always through a middleman.

343
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:27,569
Who is?

344
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:29,701
They change from job to job.

345
00:33:30,875 --> 00:33:34,242
Every time they call,
it's a different person.

346
00:33:40,718 --> 00:33:44,210
Who is Callahan's man
in the police force?

347
00:33:46,224 --> 00:33:49,057
You're kidding me? Motherfucker.

348
00:33:49,227 --> 00:33:50,888
It's you.

349
00:33:51,062 --> 00:33:52,552
Anthony Stowe, right?

350
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:54,857
You're the inside man.

351
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:56,500
Shit.

352
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:02,095
No! Larenz, no!

353
00:34:11,249 --> 00:34:14,218
If you wanna take a shot at a cop,
make sure you kill him.

354
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:16,819
And the fact that you're willing
to take that shot...

355
00:34:16,988 --> 00:34:18,979
...means you have a lot to say.

356
00:34:39,877 --> 00:34:41,003
Thanks.

357
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:42,771
No problem.

358
00:35:52,683 --> 00:35:55,618
Officer-involved shooting.
I need two suits and a toe tagger.

359
00:35:55,786 --> 00:35:58,687
2211194th, apartment 7E.

360
00:35:58,856 --> 00:36:00,517
Thank you.

361
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:36,550
It's on me.

362
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:53,472
Come on.
Let's get you something to eat.

363
00:36:57,515 --> 00:36:59,540
All right, pal.
That's enough for you.

364
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:01,309
Come on, let's go home.

365
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:04,212
This way.

366
00:37:11,362 --> 00:37:12,693
There.

367
00:37:12,863 --> 00:37:16,799
It's after hours,
but they keep it open for me.

368
00:37:17,134 --> 00:37:19,398
Hey, Lucy, what can I get you guys?

369
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:20,935
Hey, Frank.

370
00:37:21,105 --> 00:37:25,166
Water for me,
and he'll take two doubles of Scotch.

371
00:37:25,343 --> 00:37:27,140
Straight up.

372
00:37:32,516 --> 00:37:34,279
What's the problem, Anthony?

373
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:38,051
Let me guess.

374
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:41,550
Case of a lifetime
didn't go the way you planned?

375
00:38:00,311 --> 00:38:02,779
I'll be right back, Anthony.

376
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,377
I have to use the bathroom.

377
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:39,365
Come on.

378
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:41,306
You wanna kill me?

379
00:39:41,479 --> 00:39:42,776
You wanna kill me?

380
00:39:43,781 --> 00:39:45,544
Show yourself, huh?

381
00:41:27,718 --> 00:41:29,618
Remember me?

382
00:41:41,098 --> 00:41:42,998
Surprised?

383
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:47,900
Didn't see this one coming,
did you, narc cop?

384
00:41:49,974 --> 00:41:51,942
Any last words?

385
00:41:52,109 --> 00:41:53,701
No?

386
00:41:54,612 --> 00:41:57,206
Well, I have a few for you.

387
00:41:57,982 --> 00:42:00,041
I...

388
00:42:10,227 --> 00:42:11,592
Good night.

389
00:42:37,755 --> 00:42:40,246
N.O.P.D. Down, down, down!

390
00:42:55,005 --> 00:42:56,529
Okay, come on, now.

391
00:43:02,713 --> 00:43:05,705
- Come on, let's go.
- Come on, come on, come on.

392
00:43:05,916 --> 00:43:08,180
Go, go, go!

393
00:43:08,352 --> 00:43:11,253
- Need some assistance here!
- Stand back.

394
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:13,151
Get back, please.

395
00:43:14,158 --> 00:43:15,557
One, two, three.

396
00:43:19,863 --> 00:43:22,354
Coming through, coming through.

397
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:46,021
Clear!

398
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:57,331
Any last words?

399
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:02,795
You're the fucking dinosaur!

400
00:44:03,741 --> 00:44:06,972
The baby's not yours.

401
00:44:07,144 --> 00:44:08,941
Not me.

402
00:44:09,113 --> 00:44:11,946
He's just fucking with you.

403
00:44:12,116 --> 00:44:14,016
I'm pregnant.

404
00:44:21,358 --> 00:44:22,382
Clear!

405
00:44:51,121 --> 00:44:52,782
I think he's lost too much blood.

406
00:44:53,457 --> 00:44:55,584
They said he was a fighter, though.

407
00:44:56,226 --> 00:44:58,353
They said he was a bastard, actually.

408
00:45:23,253 --> 00:45:26,882
Hi, I'm Dr. Gaudio.
I operated on Mr. Stowe.

409
00:45:27,057 --> 00:45:29,423
Mac Baylor, chief of police.

410
00:45:29,593 --> 00:45:31,584
I believe this is for you.

411
00:45:32,496 --> 00:45:34,623
The bullet entered Mr. Stowe's
lower jaw...

412
00:45:34,798 --> 00:45:37,892
...and was deflected upwards,
destroying his nasal cavity...

413
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:40,764
...and finally coming to rest here
in his skull.

414
00:45:41,605 --> 00:45:43,971
Basically, he's very lucky
to still be alive.

415
00:45:45,843 --> 00:45:49,404
But it's still unclear to us when, if ever,
he'll come out of the coma he's in.

416
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:01,618
Thank you.

417
00:46:01,792 --> 00:46:03,316
Okay.

418
00:46:03,894 --> 00:46:05,156
So...

419
00:46:05,329 --> 00:46:07,160
I'll call you.

420
00:46:08,799 --> 00:46:10,926
Okay. Okay.

421
00:46:12,669 --> 00:46:14,637
- Bye.
- See you later.

422
00:47:58,842 --> 00:48:02,369
Chief, I need you in Anthony's office
right away.

423
00:48:10,387 --> 00:48:11,615
Jesus.

424
00:48:11,788 --> 00:48:13,653
Some hero, huh?

425
00:48:13,991 --> 00:48:16,459
So will you be reporting this
to the feds, or should I?

426
00:48:16,627 --> 00:48:18,857
After all he's been through?

427
00:48:19,363 --> 00:48:21,024
Let it go.

428
00:48:22,099 --> 00:48:25,125
He's a dirty cop. He always was.

429
00:48:25,302 --> 00:48:29,363
Don't let your pain
interfere with your judgment.

430
00:48:30,507 --> 00:48:33,203
The way Anthony Stowe
lived his life, right?

431
00:50:07,070 --> 00:50:08,901
Look at that.

432
00:50:09,206 --> 00:50:10,696
Hi.

433
00:51:21,311 --> 00:51:23,108
Well, hello.

434
00:51:24,514 --> 00:51:26,175
Welcome back to earth.

435
00:51:31,521 --> 00:51:34,217
Can you understand
what I'm saying?

436
00:51:41,832 --> 00:51:45,859
You've been asleep
for 57 years.

437
00:51:51,308 --> 00:51:53,902
- Just kidding, man.
- Nurse Carter?

438
00:51:54,077 --> 00:51:58,013
Man, I was running checks,
and his eyes, they just opened.

439
00:52:08,992 --> 00:52:11,324
Do you know where you are,
Mr. Stowe?

440
00:52:12,129 --> 00:52:14,063
Do you know what happened to you?

441
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:18,492
Amazing.

442
00:52:18,835 --> 00:52:22,168
Let's run some tests
and move him to Recovery.

443
00:52:24,908 --> 00:52:27,069
Welcome back, buddy.

444
00:52:33,216 --> 00:52:34,376
Mac.

445
00:52:34,551 --> 00:52:37,019
He has nowhere else to go, Val.

446
00:52:37,187 --> 00:52:41,351
You're gonna have a security detail
watching your place 24 hours a day.

447
00:52:46,596 --> 00:52:47,858
Jesus, Mac.

448
00:52:52,836 --> 00:52:56,772
And like I said,
he needs a familiar face.

449
00:52:57,073 --> 00:52:59,405
And you're entitled to the fund.

450
00:52:59,576 --> 00:53:00,838
We're getting a divorce.

451
00:53:01,011 --> 00:53:03,878
Well, you certainly can't
divorce him now.

452
00:53:04,047 --> 00:53:05,173
And you know it.

453
00:53:17,861 --> 00:53:20,125
Take a left and down the hall.

454
00:53:40,083 --> 00:53:42,347
I love you, Mark...

455
00:53:42,852 --> 00:53:44,479
...not him.

456
00:53:45,021 --> 00:53:47,888
But I feel responsible
for what happened to him.

457
00:54:03,873 --> 00:54:06,774
- They're gonna be knocked out.
- Now, why do you call it the G5?

458
00:54:06,943 --> 00:54:09,241
Well, because I have
five sons named George.

459
00:54:09,412 --> 00:54:10,970
Okay.

460
00:54:11,147 --> 00:54:14,207
We have five
interchangeable plates here.

461
00:54:14,551 --> 00:54:17,679
The original,
all-purpose slanting grill...

462
00:54:17,854 --> 00:54:20,414
- Right.
- ... that channels away the fat.

463
00:55:15,512 --> 00:55:17,070
What?

464
00:55:20,216 --> 00:55:21,911
"Earth-

465
00:55:22,085 --> 00:55:23,712
What?

466
00:55:26,389 --> 00:55:28,619
Angel. "

467
00:55:39,035 --> 00:55:40,195
Mrs. Stowe?

468
00:55:43,173 --> 00:55:46,040
- What time is it?
- It's 6:30.

469
00:55:47,210 --> 00:55:52,409
- Oh, I must have just-
- No. It's okay, Mrs. Stowe.

470
00:55:54,117 --> 00:55:58,213
But you should probably know,
it's not morally proper...

471
00:55:58,388 --> 00:56:02,848
...to help yourself
to those that can't say no.

472
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:09,021
I'm just kidding, Mrs. Stowe.

473
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:12,726
- Please, call me Valerie.
- Then call me Clemmy.

474
00:56:15,438 --> 00:56:16,803
He talked last night.

475
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:20,004
Yeah, he's been starting
to do that lately.

476
00:56:20,176 --> 00:56:22,235
It's gibberish, unfortunately.

477
00:56:22,412 --> 00:56:27,475
I think he was trying
to say "earth" and "angel. "

478
00:56:28,952 --> 00:56:32,251
- That's very romantic.
- It was our song.

479
00:56:33,723 --> 00:56:36,157
Well, a long time ago.

480
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,868
So I hear my partner's
fighting his way back from the dead.

481
00:56:49,139 --> 00:56:51,903
It's not a fight a person can win.

482
00:56:54,677 --> 00:56:57,202
Good work. Keep me informed.

483
00:57:02,452 --> 00:57:03,885
A.

484
00:57:04,821 --> 00:57:06,482
And?

485
00:57:08,124 --> 00:57:09,557
B.

486
00:57:11,661 --> 00:57:13,060
E.

487
00:57:15,165 --> 00:57:16,792
D.

488
00:57:19,035 --> 00:57:21,196
Enough.

489
00:57:22,138 --> 00:57:25,665
All right. Come on,
let's work on that body of yours.

490
00:57:27,644 --> 00:57:31,307
You know, chêre, you lost some
of your senses.

491
00:57:31,481 --> 00:57:33,813
Your vision
is gonna be a bit blurry...

492
00:57:33,983 --> 00:57:37,475
...and taste and touch usually
take the longest to come back.

493
00:57:41,691 --> 00:57:45,183
Usually about six months
for your taste buds to kick in.

494
00:57:46,729 --> 00:57:48,720
As far as touch...

495
00:57:49,399 --> 00:57:52,562
When there's nerve damage,
it can take up to a year.

496
00:57:52,735 --> 00:57:55,295
Or it might never come back,
sweetie.

497
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:58,129
Watch this.

498
00:58:44,921 --> 00:58:46,081
Gerry?

499
00:59:57,193 --> 00:59:58,717
What are you doing?

500
01:00:01,531 --> 01:00:04,989
Sorry, it's been a crazy day.

501
01:00:07,370 --> 01:00:08,962
Is there anything I can do?

502
01:00:09,772 --> 01:00:11,171
No.

503
01:00:11,741 --> 01:00:13,333
Nothing.

504
01:00:18,781 --> 01:00:21,011
Listen, there's something
I have to ask.

505
01:00:24,621 --> 01:00:26,714
What did you ever see in that guy?

506
01:00:29,258 --> 01:00:30,748
Well...

507
01:00:33,429 --> 01:00:36,023
...it's hard to explain.

508
01:00:36,199 --> 01:00:37,564
Yeah?

509
01:00:39,569 --> 01:00:40,968
Yeah.

510
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:46,234
You know what,
I think I should go back to my place.

511
01:00:48,211 --> 01:00:49,371
Fine.

512
01:01:17,006 --> 01:01:21,340
A pregnant woman
should not drink.

513
01:01:27,183 --> 01:01:29,276
Yes, I know.

514
01:01:29,852 --> 01:01:32,218
But after today, after all this...

515
01:01:35,391 --> 01:01:36,915
How's your leg?

516
01:01:37,093 --> 01:01:40,961
Much better, thank you.

517
01:01:46,369 --> 01:01:49,998
- Now, Anthony, have a seat.
- Not tonight.

518
01:01:54,844 --> 01:01:56,778
You look very beautiful.

519
01:02:29,078 --> 01:02:30,978
Holy fuck!

520
01:02:32,181 --> 01:02:33,546
Hi.

521
01:02:34,183 --> 01:02:35,810
Hi.

522
01:02:35,985 --> 01:02:37,612
How are you?

523
01:02:38,087 --> 01:02:42,114
Good. I mean,
my taste buds don't work.

524
01:02:42,291 --> 01:02:45,226
I've got this fucking limp.

525
01:02:45,394 --> 01:02:48,192
And my nerve ending are fried.

526
01:02:49,365 --> 01:02:52,857
Other than that, I'm good.

527
01:02:53,169 --> 01:02:55,137
What about you?

528
01:02:55,738 --> 01:02:56,932
Well...

529
01:02:57,106 --> 01:02:59,540
I'm good, Anthony.
I'm pretty good.

530
01:03:02,145 --> 01:03:04,705
What are you doing here?
You wanna see the chief?

531
01:03:04,881 --> 01:03:08,009
- Yeah.
- Come on.

532
01:03:14,957 --> 01:03:17,152
Hi.

533
01:03:22,365 --> 01:03:23,923
Jesus, look.

534
01:03:39,682 --> 01:03:42,082
- I'm sorry about-
- It's okay.

535
01:03:45,621 --> 01:03:48,385
- She was a great cop.
- I said...

536
01:03:50,993 --> 01:03:52,620
...it's okay.

537
01:04:09,512 --> 01:04:10,740
Come in.

538
01:04:21,257 --> 01:04:22,622
I want to come back.

539
01:04:23,693 --> 01:04:24,853
Back?

540
01:04:27,063 --> 01:04:28,963
As a narc detective?

541
01:04:29,198 --> 01:04:30,631
I don't know.

542
01:04:34,670 --> 01:04:35,898
You think you're ready?

543
01:04:39,008 --> 01:04:40,566
Well, you're not.

544
01:04:41,043 --> 01:04:44,206
- I am.
- No, you're not.

545
01:04:46,415 --> 01:04:50,249
You really think I'm gonna let you back,
knowing what I found in your desk?

546
01:04:57,126 --> 01:04:58,855
If I were you...

547
01:04:59,128 --> 01:05:01,892
...and you were me,
you'd have had me put away for that.

548
01:05:02,064 --> 01:05:03,429
Brain damaged or not.

549
01:05:04,700 --> 01:05:07,362
Just be thankful
you're a free man.

550
01:05:07,803 --> 01:05:10,670
We'll get them. We're close.

551
01:05:11,574 --> 01:05:15,101
Look, Stowe, you know, it's just good
to see you up and at them.

552
01:05:16,612 --> 01:05:17,840
Just tell me one thing.

553
01:05:21,083 --> 01:05:23,551
I know Callahan was there...

554
01:05:24,854 --> 01:05:26,845
...when the kid shot you...

555
01:05:27,023 --> 01:05:29,514
...then shot off his own hand.

556
01:05:31,727 --> 01:05:33,786
What really went down that night?

557
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:39,461
I don't remember.

558
01:05:39,635 --> 01:05:41,068
Nothing?

559
01:05:42,271 --> 01:05:45,365
You had seven months
to figure this out...

560
01:05:46,642 --> 01:05:48,872
...and now you're telling me...

561
01:05:49,578 --> 01:05:51,205
...you've been waiting for me?

562
01:05:51,380 --> 01:05:53,177
I'm sorry, Stowe.

563
01:05:53,416 --> 01:05:56,351
Like I said, you know,
it's just good...

564
01:05:56,519 --> 01:05:59,545
...just to see you walking
around here.

565
01:06:02,558 --> 01:06:06,358
Let me know if you need anything.

566
01:06:11,267 --> 01:06:13,895
Anything but your old job.

567
01:06:40,463 --> 01:06:42,829
- Hey.
- Hey.

568
01:06:50,506 --> 01:06:52,474
- You okay?
- Yeah.

569
01:07:29,712 --> 01:07:31,145
Show me your hands, asshole!

570
01:07:33,382 --> 01:07:35,612
- Drop your weapon.
- Down! Down! Down!

571
01:07:35,785 --> 01:07:37,218
- Move. Move.
- Where's your arms?

572
01:07:37,386 --> 01:07:38,717
- Down.
- Let's move.

573
01:07:38,888 --> 01:07:40,287
Keep down.

574
01:07:41,257 --> 01:07:42,884
- On the floor.
- Down. Down. Down.

575
01:07:43,059 --> 01:07:45,220
- Clear.
- Get down. Show me your hands.

576
01:07:46,762 --> 01:07:48,093
Okay.

577
01:07:48,364 --> 01:07:49,661
Clear!

578
01:07:53,469 --> 01:07:54,800
Stay down. Don't move.

579
01:07:55,004 --> 01:07:56,232
Room clear.

580
01:07:57,773 --> 01:07:59,206
Shit.

581
01:08:00,509 --> 01:08:01,942
Secure.

582
01:08:03,846 --> 01:08:06,041
It's clean. Completely.

583
01:08:06,215 --> 01:08:07,580
We got played.

584
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:09,581
They don't even have a basement.

585
01:08:09,752 --> 01:08:13,586
You know, I'm not even sure
Callahan has ever been here.

586
01:08:27,570 --> 01:08:29,936
- Officer down!
- Sniper!

587
01:08:30,106 --> 01:08:31,539
Get down! Stay behind the car.

588
01:08:31,707 --> 01:08:33,698
- Check your roofs!
- Cover him. Cover him.

589
01:08:33,876 --> 01:08:36,174
- Up there.
- I got you. I got you. I got you covered.

590
01:08:36,345 --> 01:08:38,245
Check him. Check him.

591
01:08:42,585 --> 01:08:44,212
- Hey, kid.
- Hey.

592
01:08:44,386 --> 01:08:48,117
Actually, you know, it's Chad.
Chad Mansen.

593
01:08:49,091 --> 01:08:51,321
Chad Mansen.

594
01:08:51,760 --> 01:08:53,694
You should look into changing that.

595
01:08:54,363 --> 01:08:56,797
It's Mansen with an E-N,
not an O-N, so...

596
01:08:58,033 --> 01:09:02,732
Clementine told me you passed by
a few times while I was under.

597
01:09:03,439 --> 01:09:05,964
Do I owe you money or something?

598
01:09:06,642 --> 01:09:11,341
No. No, but I owe you some
information that you already paid for.

599
01:09:11,814 --> 01:09:13,543
You asked me to
keep my eye open...

600
01:09:13,716 --> 01:09:15,684
- ... for this Callahan guy.
- Yeah.

601
01:09:15,851 --> 01:09:17,148
Well, I saw him.

602
01:09:17,319 --> 01:09:18,843
- You saw him?
- Yeah.

603
01:09:19,021 --> 01:09:21,512
When you went upstairs
to that guy's townhouse...

604
01:09:21,690 --> 01:09:24,750
...he showed up 10 minutes later,
casing the place.

605
01:09:24,994 --> 01:09:27,462
Then cops and ambulances
showed up and he took off.

606
01:09:27,630 --> 01:09:29,063
I tried so hard to get to you...

607
01:09:29,231 --> 01:09:31,028
...but the cops
wouldn't let me near you.

608
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:33,896
I tried to call you,
but your service was disconnected.

609
01:09:36,939 --> 01:09:39,237
Thanks, kid.

610
01:09:41,043 --> 01:09:42,601
Chad.

611
01:09:50,319 --> 01:09:51,752
Been watching the news.

612
01:09:51,921 --> 01:09:54,754
Been feeling so guilty about all this.

613
01:09:55,824 --> 01:09:58,622
This was going to happen...

614
01:09:59,995 --> 01:10:01,758
...no matter what.

615
01:10:03,699 --> 01:10:06,964
Well, if you need anything,
just let me know.

616
01:10:08,237 --> 01:10:09,602
What's in the bag?

617
01:10:09,772 --> 01:10:11,740
Oh, it's fresh fruit from the market.

618
01:10:11,907 --> 01:10:14,501
Last time I saw you, didn't look
like you were eating well.

619
01:10:14,677 --> 01:10:15,974
Later.

620
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:19,980
Be careful.

621
01:10:57,453 --> 01:10:59,250
One second.

622
01:11:01,991 --> 01:11:03,458
Hi.

623
01:11:05,594 --> 01:11:08,358
You have no right to be here.

624
01:11:08,530 --> 01:11:10,998
Can I take a minute of your time?

625
01:11:11,166 --> 01:11:13,657
Is Walt around?

626
01:11:14,403 --> 01:11:17,895
Walt is working two jobs
because of what you did.

627
01:11:24,046 --> 01:11:25,206
What's this?

628
01:11:29,985 --> 01:11:31,009
Jesus Christ, Stowe.

629
01:11:31,186 --> 01:11:34,019
Who'd you screw over
to come up with this sort of cash?

630
01:11:34,189 --> 01:11:38,057
The force has insurance for
these kinds of accidents.

631
01:11:38,994 --> 01:11:41,554
And I don't need the money.

632
01:11:43,632 --> 01:11:48,035
I guess also
I want to say I'm- I'm sorry.

633
01:12:47,129 --> 01:12:48,994
Sorry, partner.

634
01:13:05,147 --> 01:13:08,674
- Valerie?
- I'm over here, Anthony.

635
01:13:13,288 --> 01:13:14,778
Where are you going?

636
01:13:16,792 --> 01:13:19,693
Mark has a condo on Canal, so...

637
01:13:19,862 --> 01:13:22,854
Yeah, I was just getting
the last of my stuff.

638
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:26,834
I thought I was supposed to go.

639
01:13:27,136 --> 01:13:28,933
I can leave today.

640
01:13:29,638 --> 01:13:31,071
No.

641
01:13:31,306 --> 01:13:33,467
It's your place...

642
01:13:33,642 --> 01:13:35,667
...and you need to be here.

643
01:13:38,747 --> 01:13:40,442
You're in no condition.

644
01:13:40,616 --> 01:13:42,777
Neither are you.

645
01:13:44,219 --> 01:13:45,618
As quick as usual.

646
01:14:02,171 --> 01:14:03,536
So.

647
01:14:04,173 --> 01:14:05,697
So.

648
01:14:08,444 --> 01:14:10,844
So take care of yourself.

649
01:14:15,951 --> 01:14:17,350
Take care of the baby, huh?

650
01:14:49,485 --> 01:14:51,146
Fuck.

651
01:16:01,089 --> 01:16:02,488
Come in.

652
01:16:02,958 --> 01:16:05,654
Hey, Mr. Stowe.
Sorry to bother you.

653
01:16:05,827 --> 01:16:08,125
Looks like the fruit worked.
You look great.

654
01:16:08,297 --> 01:16:10,561
Thanks.
I've got to go somewhere.

655
01:16:10,732 --> 01:16:12,996
I'll be back in half an hour.

656
01:16:13,168 --> 01:16:15,796
- You can hang out if you want.
- Where are you going, boss?

657
01:16:16,905 --> 01:16:18,167
To right a wrong.

658
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:22,376
- Be back in a second, okay?
- Okay. Cool. I can chill.

659
01:16:49,404 --> 01:16:52,862
- Hello.
- Mark? Is Valerie here?

660
01:16:53,241 --> 01:16:55,300
Is this some kind of joke?

661
01:16:55,911 --> 01:16:58,175
She's going back to you, Anthony.

662
01:17:04,219 --> 01:17:06,153
Tony? Tony?

663
01:17:06,321 --> 01:17:09,313
- Oh, hey, Mrs. Stowe.
- Hey, Chad.

664
01:17:10,959 --> 01:17:14,986
- Where's Tony?
- I think he went looking for you.

665
01:17:19,368 --> 01:17:20,699
Mrs. Stowe.

666
01:17:25,540 --> 01:17:28,737
Who-? What the-? Get off.

667
01:18:02,678 --> 01:18:04,270
Val?

668
01:18:18,527 --> 01:18:20,893
My man wants to see you.

669
01:18:21,063 --> 01:18:23,463
Or your ex-wife is dead.

670
01:18:24,633 --> 01:18:26,726
She's my wife.

671
01:18:28,437 --> 01:18:30,632
Not my ex.

672
01:18:42,851 --> 01:18:44,375
All right. Here.

673
01:20:40,902 --> 01:20:42,563
Drop the gun.

674
01:20:47,042 --> 01:20:48,509
Well, Anthony.

675
01:20:48,677 --> 01:20:51,612
Long time since we've talked together,
just me and you.

676
01:20:51,780 --> 01:20:53,543
Let her go...

677
01:20:53,715 --> 01:20:54,943
...and take me.

678
01:21:15,036 --> 01:21:16,867
We had it good, Anthony.

679
01:21:18,173 --> 01:21:19,936
We were narc cops.

680
01:21:20,108 --> 01:21:21,234
I was the supplier...

681
01:21:21,409 --> 01:21:25,140
...but you fucked it all up when
you decided to become a consumer.

682
01:21:25,313 --> 01:21:27,907
But I was never a bad cop, Gabriel.

683
01:21:30,485 --> 01:21:32,419
You know, Anthony...

684
01:21:32,587 --> 01:21:35,283
...your fatal flaw is that
you never understood who you were.

685
01:21:35,457 --> 01:21:39,052
We're both bad cops.
It's just that I'm out of the closet.

686
01:21:39,227 --> 01:21:40,558
It must be freeing.

687
01:21:40,729 --> 01:21:44,096
You must have been in a lot of pain
for a long time, huh?

688
01:21:44,266 --> 01:21:47,497
Another man banging your wife
while you were in a coma.

689
01:21:49,404 --> 01:21:51,872
How do you think I feel?

690
01:21:52,274 --> 01:21:54,333
Waiting for my partner to come...

691
01:21:54,509 --> 01:21:58,240
...and take everything away from me
that I'd ever earned.

692
01:21:59,681 --> 01:22:01,808
You were the only one
who could take me down.

693
01:22:02,350 --> 01:22:05,114
But not even you could do it.
Not anymore.

694
01:22:07,322 --> 01:22:10,086
Yeah, I wanted to fuck your wife.

695
01:22:11,526 --> 01:22:14,825
But I didn't do it. No.

696
01:22:16,097 --> 01:22:19,123
Never did. You wanna know why?

697
01:22:20,869 --> 01:22:23,030
Because at the time,
she loved you too much.

698
01:22:23,204 --> 01:22:25,798
Isn't that some shit? She loved you.

699
01:22:28,343 --> 01:22:29,901
It goes back to what I told you...

700
01:22:30,078 --> 01:22:33,605
...that night you got shot
in the medulla oblongata.

701
01:22:36,084 --> 01:22:38,177
I lied to you.

702
01:22:38,787 --> 01:22:42,052
I wanted you to go to hell knowing
I was fucking your wife.

703
01:22:43,725 --> 01:22:47,855
Why couldn't you just
stay in the coma, Anthony?

704
01:22:48,730 --> 01:22:51,858
You were always
so goddamn indestructible.

705
01:22:53,969 --> 01:22:55,129
Well, not anymore.

706
01:22:56,871 --> 01:23:00,500
My business in New Orleans
is done.

707
01:23:03,712 --> 01:23:06,704
I'm heading to the new frontier.

708
01:23:07,415 --> 01:23:09,576
Starting a family.

709
01:23:09,751 --> 01:23:12,185
Me and my new wife.

710
01:23:15,590 --> 01:23:18,184
How do you like that, Tony?

711
01:23:18,493 --> 01:23:20,085
Me, a father.

712
01:23:21,596 --> 01:23:23,154
By the way, who is the father?

713
01:23:33,608 --> 01:23:35,872
Your evidence from the townhouse,
Anthony.

714
01:23:36,044 --> 01:23:38,035
You remember all that, don't you?

715
01:23:38,213 --> 01:23:40,181
Brain still working, Tony?

716
01:23:42,584 --> 01:23:44,984
But here's the really beautiful part.

717
01:23:46,087 --> 01:23:48,555
Meet your hero.

718
01:23:48,723 --> 01:23:50,315
Cleanest cop in the world...

719
01:23:50,492 --> 01:23:54,087
...who always had a suspicion
that Anthony Stowe was a dirty cop.

720
01:23:54,996 --> 01:23:58,898
Dirty cop gets killed.
Clean cop gets a shiny new medal.

721
01:24:03,438 --> 01:24:04,928
I love this country.

722
01:24:05,240 --> 01:24:06,969
Nothing personal, Tony.

723
01:24:07,142 --> 01:24:09,736
But it works well for me,
you have to agree, huh?

724
01:24:27,529 --> 01:24:28,860
There is one flaw.

725
01:24:30,432 --> 01:24:33,128
You're suicidal, Van. I like that.

726
01:24:33,601 --> 01:24:36,798
One thing I learned in the past two
years is you don't leave loose ends.

727
01:24:38,273 --> 01:24:39,763
I'm a pretty big loose end.

728
01:24:41,509 --> 01:24:45,445
Now, you need an escape,
but what I need is assurances...

729
01:24:46,681 --> 01:24:48,239
...and insurance.

730
01:24:49,584 --> 01:24:52,985
You've acquired a dictionary
since we last spoke.

731
01:24:53,521 --> 01:24:56,922
You make it out of here,
you'll get your pension.

732
01:24:57,092 --> 01:24:59,322
It's a good life. Maybe.

733
01:24:59,661 --> 01:25:03,688
But if you wanna make it out of here,
point your gun at Mr. Stowe.

734
01:25:11,139 --> 01:25:12,731
Callahan.

735
01:25:17,712 --> 01:25:18,940
Van Huffel.

736
01:25:23,451 --> 01:25:27,217
- Hey, I'm Jimmy.
- Shut the fuck up, Jimmy.

737
01:25:33,061 --> 01:25:34,790
Put your guns down.

738
01:25:35,797 --> 01:25:40,131
Well, congratulations, Anthony.
You have another friend after all.

739
01:26:47,468 --> 01:26:50,096
Hear that? It's over.

740
01:26:52,040 --> 01:26:53,735
All right. All right. All right.

741
01:26:53,942 --> 01:26:55,170
All right.

742
01:27:00,248 --> 01:27:01,681
Chad forgives you.

743
01:27:01,849 --> 01:27:03,248
Not me.

744
01:27:10,658 --> 01:27:12,649
Tony!

745
01:27:20,335 --> 01:27:22,599
- The car.
- I'll cover.

746
01:28:53,728 --> 01:28:55,753
How many do you count?

747
01:28:57,398 --> 01:29:00,231
- Six or seven.
- Jesus.

748
01:29:23,091 --> 01:29:24,888
Got to go.

749
01:29:25,993 --> 01:29:27,654
You're on your own, buddy.

750
01:29:27,829 --> 01:29:29,854
This horse's gone lame.

751
01:29:55,790 --> 01:29:58,224
- Come on.
- Tony!

752
01:29:59,727 --> 01:30:01,354
Help!

753
01:30:21,949 --> 01:30:24,281
- Walter.
- Yeah, Stowe.

754
01:30:25,753 --> 01:30:27,277
Here.

755
01:30:50,645 --> 01:30:52,374
- Come on!
- Fuck you.

756
01:30:52,547 --> 01:30:55,778
- Get the fuck up!
- Go on. Fucking shoot me.

757
01:30:56,350 --> 01:30:57,874
Come on.

758
01:31:11,132 --> 01:31:12,190
Hey!

759
01:31:32,053 --> 01:31:34,146
- Stop. Stop!
- What?

760
01:31:34,322 --> 01:31:36,722
- I have to stop.
- Come on!

761
01:32:58,739 --> 01:33:00,206
Tony.

762
01:33:02,543 --> 01:33:03,703
Welcome back.

763
01:33:03,878 --> 01:33:08,577
Detective Harrington,
meet Detective Anthony Stowe.

764
01:33:09,383 --> 01:33:12,284
- Detective.
- Someone had to watch your back.

765
01:33:12,453 --> 01:33:15,786
She qualified on the range
before she got your assignment.

766
01:33:19,727 --> 01:33:21,319
You gotta hear this.

767
01:33:21,495 --> 01:33:23,429
In the search
of Van Huffel's house...

768
01:33:23,598 --> 01:33:26,362
...we found a good portion
of the monies...

769
01:33:26,534 --> 01:33:29,196
...and the camera
from Tommy's jacket.

770
01:33:33,274 --> 01:33:35,242
You gotta look at this.

771
01:33:46,087 --> 01:33:49,250
- What the fuck did you do that for?
- Sorry, baby, he's a loose end.

772
01:33:49,423 --> 01:33:51,584
- So are you.
- We were fucking partners!

773
01:33:51,759 --> 01:33:56,128
- What the fuck are you talking about?
- Last words, detective.

774
01:33:58,399 --> 01:34:01,368
Get that gun out of my face.
We don't need this whore.

775
01:34:04,972 --> 01:34:07,338
Take the stuff.
I'll see you when the heat dies down.

776
01:34:07,508 --> 01:34:10,136
And don't forget the camera.
Go!

777
01:34:10,737 --> 01:34:16,737
