1
00:01:23,146 --> 00:01:25,090
Slow it down, Bob.

2
00:01:25,271 --> 00:01:27,884
Need a doughnut break.
We're having chest pains.

3
00:01:28,067 --> 00:01:29,963
Keep it moving, flabby.

4
00:01:30,152 --> 00:01:32,389
Opening night
is less than a week away.

5
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:36,688
Where in the script does it say that
Truman Capote has a fat, saggy ass?

6
00:01:36,867 --> 00:01:42,398
In the very beginning. "Enter Capote,
followed by his fat, saggy ass."

7
00:01:42,581 --> 00:01:46,987
-Hi, Walt.
-Oh, Suzie-Q, looking good. Ruthy.

8
00:01:47,167 --> 00:01:49,651
-Let's have drinks again soon.
-I'll call you.

9
00:01:52,173 --> 00:01:55,745
Nice. When did you
have drinks with her?

10
00:01:56,552 --> 00:01:59,666
The other day. Didn't I tell you?
She stopped by.

11
00:01:59,846 --> 00:02:02,330
-Well, where was l?
-You were....

12
00:02:02,516 --> 00:02:04,964
Oh, that's right,
you were taking a nap.

13
00:02:05,143 --> 00:02:10,429
-So did you make a move?
-I wanted to. I couldn't get her alone.

14
00:02:10,604 --> 00:02:14,046
Had that friend, Ruthy, with her.
She's like a frigging shadow.

15
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:17,521
-Hi.
-Pole. Pole. Pole.

16
00:02:20,115 --> 00:02:23,021
Okay, now that's seven mushroom,
three onion...

17
00:02:23,202 --> 00:02:25,862
...two regular cheese
but one with no pickles.

18
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,652
And we have six fries, four Pepsi,
and two 7 UP.

19
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:33,857
You got 180 seconds,
or that food is free.

20
00:02:34,045 --> 00:02:35,825
Keep your wallets handy, boys.

21
00:02:37,713 --> 00:02:41,120
I keep flip-flopping whether
to go with the suit or the kimono.

22
00:02:41,302 --> 00:02:44,044
Hey, guys, we've got a tester
on number six.

23
00:02:44,221 --> 00:02:47,502
Okay, thanks, Mim.
What did Robert Morse do in it?

24
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,046
He did both,
but he had the budget for it.

25
00:02:50,226 --> 00:02:54,081
We got 1 2 American Charlies,
seven with fungus, three tearjerkers...

26
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:57,469
...two bare-assed, hold the pom-poms
on one and frog sticks.

27
00:02:57,651 --> 00:03:00,264
We could do it with three hands
tied behind our backs!

28
00:03:30,181 --> 00:03:33,462
Rocket, I need four Pepsi
and two 7 UP on number six.

29
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:36,628
Don't forget, you've got two
Diet Pepsi on number nine.

30
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:39,375
You got it, Mimmy.
Three 7 UP coming up.

31
00:03:39,564 --> 00:03:43,171
-No, it's two 7 UP--
-I got it. I got it.

32
00:04:13,051 --> 00:04:15,170
Looks like
they're having serious trouble.

33
00:04:16,305 --> 00:04:18,706
Come on. Come on.

34
00:04:18,893 --> 00:04:22,383
1 2, 1 1, 10, 9...

35
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,967
-...8, 7, 6, 5...
-I'd go with the kimono.

36
00:04:26,149 --> 00:04:28,926
...4, 3, 2--

37
00:04:29,107 --> 00:04:33,348
-I'm sorry, boys. Maybe next time.
-Thanks, Mimmy.

38
00:04:33,571 --> 00:04:34,973
So close.

39
00:04:36,992 --> 00:04:39,816
You downloaded another picture
of your lnternet pal.

40
00:04:39,993 --> 00:04:41,937
What's her name, Poon Tang?

41
00:04:42,119 --> 00:04:46,490
-Her name is May Fong.
-So she says.

42
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:48,985
She could be
a 50-year-old circus freak...

43
00:04:49,169 --> 00:04:52,111
...with six teeth
and a set of hairy walnuts.

44
00:04:52,339 --> 00:04:53,989
Nice.

45
00:04:54,673 --> 00:04:57,157
They paid 3.5 million.
We could've gotten it for 1.2.

46
00:04:57,343 --> 00:04:58,664
I want my drink.

47
00:04:58,845 --> 00:05:02,287
Well, hallelujah.
We finally got our drinks.

48
00:05:02,474 --> 00:05:04,505
Root beer machine
had to be changed.

49
00:05:04,685 --> 00:05:09,255
What the--? Hold on, pal. Diet Pepsi.
We ordered Diet Pepsi. Are you dense?

50
00:05:09,437 --> 00:05:12,514
I'm Rocket. Dennis works
at the post office. Need stamps?

51
00:05:12,691 --> 00:05:15,092
Oh, so you're a smart-ass, huh?

52
00:05:15,277 --> 00:05:17,678
Oh, you idiot!
These are my good pants!

53
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:20,802
Oh, those are her good pants.

54
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:22,722
Honey--

55
00:05:23,118 --> 00:05:24,439
Unbelievable.

56
00:05:24,617 --> 00:05:28,059
-I want to talk to the owner.
-All right, right behind you.

57
00:05:30,749 --> 00:05:33,233
Which one of you two
is in charge of this dump?

58
00:05:33,418 --> 00:05:35,819
Your damn busboy just ruined
my wife's pants.

59
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:40,291
Well, I'm sorry about that.
You know, club soda's good for that.

60
00:05:40,466 --> 00:05:43,956
I'm sure you think it's very progressive
to hire Jerry's Kids...

61
00:05:44,136 --> 00:05:46,115
...but keep the freaks in the back...

62
00:05:46,432 --> 00:05:49,128
...washing dishes,
away from the paying customers.

63
00:05:49,309 --> 00:05:52,799
You are absolutely right.
How many times have I told you, Walt...

64
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:55,883
-...we don't want freaks here.
-He tells me. I never--

65
00:05:56,066 --> 00:05:59,427
-Ever! Ever, do you?
-For some reason. I don't know why.

66
00:05:59,608 --> 00:06:02,432
We're on top of it.
We're gonna handle it right now.

67
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:05,272
Rocket, let me talk to you
for a minute.

68
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:12,808
You know, we have a rule about freaks
in this place. We don't like them.

69
00:06:13,371 --> 00:06:14,985
And we don't want them.

70
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,819
So, Rocket,
you see that door over there?

71
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:20,196
Would you escort
this freak through it?

72
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:24,116
No problem.
Right this way, please.

73
00:06:24,298 --> 00:06:25,749
I'm not going anywhere.

74
00:06:31,556 --> 00:06:33,041
Don't forget your bag.

75
00:06:33,723 --> 00:06:36,124
Come on, let's get out of here.

76
00:06:36,767 --> 00:06:39,673
Would you like those root beers to go?

77
00:06:40,813 --> 00:06:43,297
All right, burgers on the house!

78
00:06:45,444 --> 00:06:50,343
-He's just kidding, you cheap bastards.
-No, I'm not. No, I'm not.

79
00:06:50,532 --> 00:06:52,933
No, yeah, he is. He is.

80
00:07:22,227 --> 00:07:25,256
-Nice stop, guys. Way to go.
-Thanks, Stan.

81
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:34,899
Great game, Walt.
That was a huge win.

82
00:07:35,072 --> 00:07:37,814
Thanks, Stan. I was seeing
the puck well tonight.

83
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:41,973
-Walt, how many saves you guys have?
-I had 1 1, and Bob had 26.

84
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,148
Bob-o was standing
on his head out there.

85
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:48,157
Check this out.

86
00:07:51,754 --> 00:07:55,161
Wow, she's new. Hey, Dave,
how about another tall one?

87
00:07:55,341 --> 00:07:57,578
You got it.
How about you there, Bob?

88
00:07:57,758 --> 00:08:00,418
No, I'm cool.
I'm the designated walker tonight.

89
00:08:00,595 --> 00:08:01,916
Got it.

90
00:08:03,558 --> 00:08:06,171
I taste ice cream.

91
00:08:08,186 --> 00:08:11,349
You got a dart in your head,
you dumb shit.

92
00:08:11,522 --> 00:08:16,504
Hey, Romeo, how about you invite your
friend May out for a visit this spring?

93
00:08:16,692 --> 00:08:19,093
Vineyard can be romantic
that time of year...

94
00:08:19,278 --> 00:08:20,680
...and we so horny.

95
00:08:20,861 --> 00:08:25,232
No, I checked the Farmer's Almanac.
It's supposed to be a muddy spring.

96
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:28,738
No, it's gonna be sloppy.
I don't want her to come out--

97
00:08:32,792 --> 00:08:35,869
Seriously, man, I just--
You know, I want it to be right.

98
00:08:36,044 --> 00:08:38,868
-I'm trying to be smart.
-You overanalyze this stuff.

99
00:08:39,049 --> 00:08:40,993
What is that supposed to mean?

100
00:08:41,173 --> 00:08:44,454
You should be talking to this chickie-poo
down at the bar.

101
00:08:44,843 --> 00:08:46,962
-No.
-Come on.

102
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:50,712
-Come on. Get over there. Say hello.
-No. No. No, don't do it.

103
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:54,135
-No way. Cut it out. Stop it.
-Go on. She's smiling at you.

104
00:08:54,309 --> 00:08:57,916
If she wanted to talk to somebody,
she would've brought a friend.

105
00:08:58,439 --> 00:09:04,382
Hi. How are you? My name's Bob Tenor.
But I'm really more of a baritone.

106
00:09:04,571 --> 00:09:06,433
Hi, Bob.

107
00:09:06,614 --> 00:09:09,062
This is my brother, Walt.

108
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:16,940
Look, if you're ever in town--
I mean, I know you're in town now...

109
00:09:17,124 --> 00:09:20,452
...but I mean, if you're ever in town
and not in a bar....

110
00:09:20,628 --> 00:09:24,035
That came off wrong. It sounded
like you were a skanky whore.

111
00:09:25,758 --> 00:09:28,159
I'd love it if you'd come by
Quikee Burger...

112
00:09:28,342 --> 00:09:32,032
...which is my restaurant that I own
with my brother, Walt.

113
00:09:32,221 --> 00:09:34,083
You met him.

114
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:37,625
Time's up, Casanever.

115
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:39,841
-Can I join you for a drink?
-Sure.

116
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:41,882
-Okay. What's your name?
-Debbie.

117
00:09:42,064 --> 00:09:45,178
-Hi, I'm Walt Tenor.
-Nice to meet you.

118
00:09:47,027 --> 00:09:51,315
Dear May,
thanks for the latest photo,

119
00:09:51,489 --> 00:09:53,973
I look at it whenever
I'm in need of a smile,

120
00:09:54,156 --> 00:09:58,057
I'm sending a picture of me at work,
Hope you like it,

121
00:09:58,245 --> 00:10:00,564
Yours, Bob,

122
00:10:00,748 --> 00:10:02,985
I' m starting to cramp.

123
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:04,860
-Hey.
-Hey.

124
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:06,937
-How's the letter coming?
-Good.

125
00:10:07,128 --> 00:10:08,908
Yeah, what do you got?

126
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:13,208
It's personal. You know,
I don't go nosing into your business.

127
00:10:13,383 --> 00:10:16,873
I'm sorry.
Mind typing on your knees?

128
00:10:17,054 --> 00:10:18,375
Okay.

129
00:10:18,555 --> 00:10:20,839
Here we go. There you go.
Turn around.

130
00:10:24,268 --> 00:10:28,251
-Shouldn't you study your lines?
-Not necessary. Locked and loaded.

131
00:10:28,439 --> 00:10:30,171
Then help me stack the wood.

132
00:10:30,359 --> 00:10:33,931
I can't. I could pull something.
It's a performance day.

133
00:10:38,323 --> 00:10:41,065
Aren't you a little bit nervous?

134
00:10:42,037 --> 00:10:45,200
What's a four-letter word for snatch?

135
00:10:45,663 --> 00:10:47,525
Grab.

136
00:10:53,254 --> 00:10:55,996
You're not even a little bit nervous?

137
00:10:56,175 --> 00:10:58,576
What's there to be nervous about?

138
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:03,742
Well, you're up there in a one-man
show, in front of all those people.

139
00:11:03,931 --> 00:11:06,496
You know, I'd be crapping myself.

140
00:11:06,684 --> 00:11:08,921
It's my ninth year,
I think I'm just....

141
00:11:09,102 --> 00:11:11,468
I feel like I'm over it, you know?

142
00:11:11,645 --> 00:11:14,926
-I guess that's how you have to be.
-Well....

143
00:11:17,569 --> 00:11:21,224
You're doing that blinking thing.
Are you gonna have a panic attack?

144
00:11:21,405 --> 00:11:23,301
-No, I'm cool.
-Are you all right?

145
00:11:23,491 --> 00:11:25,857
-You all right?
-No, I'm not gonna--

146
00:11:26,035 --> 00:11:29,064
-I'm gonna--
-Oh, God. Take it easy.

147
00:11:29,246 --> 00:11:30,896
-Calm down.
-I think I'm dying.

148
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,448
-I'm dying.
-You're not.

149
00:11:32,626 --> 00:11:35,485
-Oh, God.
-You're having a panic attack.

150
00:11:35,668 --> 00:11:37,564
-Come on. Take it easy.
-Get my bag.

151
00:11:37,751 --> 00:11:39,818
Wait, I'm having an arrhythmia.

152
00:11:40,007 --> 00:11:43,206
Here you go. Breathe into the bag.
Short breaths.

153
00:11:43,385 --> 00:11:45,416
Concentrate on the breathing.

154
00:11:45,595 --> 00:11:48,419
It's nine years in a row!
I don't want to go on-stage.

155
00:11:48,598 --> 00:11:50,753
Why do I have to go on-stage
with you?

156
00:11:50,932 --> 00:11:53,838
You're gonna be fine.
You're gonna be fine, all right?

157
00:11:55,647 --> 00:11:58,635
You're gonna have fun tonight,
all right?

158
00:11:58,815 --> 00:12:00,465
You're gonna have fun.

159
00:12:00,649 --> 00:12:06,016
Any normal person with a normal sense
of self-preservation...

160
00:12:06,196 --> 00:12:09,851
...would understand that
all an artist has is his life.

161
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:13,939
And what he observes
as he passes through his life.

162
00:12:14,121 --> 00:12:18,691
And any serious writer hanging out
for years with the rich, well...

163
00:12:18,874 --> 00:12:22,775
...my God, you'd have to be deluded
to the point of derangement...

164
00:12:22,963 --> 00:12:27,908
...not to realize that that writer
was taking notes.

165
00:12:30,344 --> 00:12:33,786
My God, I even told them.

166
00:12:33,971 --> 00:12:37,826
They knew I was writing this book.
What did they think I was there for?

167
00:12:38,017 --> 00:12:40,630
The intellectual stimulation?

168
00:12:40,812 --> 00:12:42,263
The wit?

169
00:12:42,439 --> 00:12:44,171
The spiritual uplift?

170
00:12:44,355 --> 00:12:47,600
I brought the intellect
and the wit to the party.

171
00:12:50,152 --> 00:12:53,094
Okay, okay, he's coming.
He's coming.

172
00:12:56,202 --> 00:12:58,944
Bravo! Bravo!

173
00:12:59,204 --> 00:13:02,063
-You were just wonderful!
-Thank you, Mim.

174
00:13:02,248 --> 00:13:03,980
Yeah, Walt, you were great.

175
00:13:04,167 --> 00:13:06,146
Bob, you sucked.

176
00:13:06,338 --> 00:13:09,080
-Hey.
-Come on, Rocket, I'm not an actor.

177
00:13:09,254 --> 00:13:10,868
So, what's up for next year?

178
00:13:11,507 --> 00:13:14,914
-Oh, I don't know.
-Oh, come on, tell them the big idea.

179
00:13:15,092 --> 00:13:17,376
-What is it?
-He wants to do a musical version...

180
00:13:17,553 --> 00:13:20,495
-...of Bonnie and Clyde.
-All right!

181
00:13:29,773 --> 00:13:34,508
-You were awesome last night.
-Thanks.

182
00:13:35,404 --> 00:13:37,723
Is everything all right?
You seem a little--

183
00:13:37,906 --> 00:13:42,805
Remember when we were little and we
first found out we'd never be separated?

184
00:13:42,996 --> 00:13:46,403
-Sure.
-Made a blood pact that day, remember?

185
00:13:46,579 --> 00:13:50,151
Yeah, we promised we'd never hold
each other back, no matter what.

186
00:13:50,334 --> 00:13:54,106
And we never have. Right off the bat,
we made a hell of a team.

187
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:57,122
Trick or treat!

188
00:14:11,104 --> 00:14:13,552
Get them! Get them!

189
00:14:19,446 --> 00:14:22,388
Man, those freaks are fast.

190
00:14:27,035 --> 00:14:28,979
Strike one!

191
00:14:29,161 --> 00:14:31,774
Let's do it! Now, come on!
Get out there!

192
00:14:37,876 --> 00:14:42,740
Break. Break. Break. Break. Okay,
come on. You keep it clean, now.

193
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:58,551
You're out!

194
00:15:06,987 --> 00:15:09,846
Your kings and queens!

195
00:15:11,616 --> 00:15:12,937
Right, Betty!

196
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:15,025
So, what's your point?

197
00:15:16,163 --> 00:15:18,230
Here, sit down.

198
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:21,819
Oh, jeez.

199
00:15:22,919 --> 00:15:24,781
I want to be an actor.

200
00:15:26,047 --> 00:15:28,114
Yeah. Of course.

201
00:15:28,299 --> 00:15:31,741
Look, I'm sorry, man.
I know I freaked out yesterday...

202
00:15:31,926 --> 00:15:33,993
...but I'll go on-stage with you again.

203
00:15:34,179 --> 00:15:38,115
You can even sing if you want to.
I'd never stop you from doing that.

204
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:42,174
I mean, I want to be a real actor.

205
00:15:42,353 --> 00:15:43,838
I want to move to Hollywood.

206
00:15:44,438 --> 00:15:46,593
-What?!
-I think I got the chops for it.

207
00:15:46,776 --> 00:15:48,931
Those people last night were moved.

208
00:15:49,111 --> 00:15:53,012
-I got to them.
-Look, those were your friends.

209
00:15:54,197 --> 00:15:56,352
What's that supposed to mean?

210
00:15:56,535 --> 00:15:58,819
Look, I just meant....

211
00:15:59,747 --> 00:16:02,231
Look, man, we're from
Martha's Vineyard, okay?

212
00:16:02,413 --> 00:16:04,615
You know, people here....

213
00:16:04,793 --> 00:16:07,358
You know, we're lifeguards
and fishermen.

214
00:16:07,546 --> 00:16:09,947
We own restaurants.

215
00:16:10,129 --> 00:16:13,292
We do not star in movies.

216
00:16:14,464 --> 00:16:15,832
What about Meryl Streep?

217
00:16:16,012 --> 00:16:18,836
She's not from the Vineyard.
She shot one movie here.

218
00:16:19,013 --> 00:16:22,258
She stayed on a couple extra
weeks because she liked it.

219
00:16:22,432 --> 00:16:26,087
-What are you--? What is your point?
-Well....

220
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:31,425
Okay, look, I'm gonna
put it to you this way.

221
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:36,352
Who were the last conjoined twins
who were nominated for an Oscar?

222
00:16:37,824 --> 00:16:41,023
I can't believe I'm hearing this
from you, of all people.

223
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,684
Isn't that what people told us
our whole lives?

224
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:46,858
We couldn't do what normal
people did. Never stopped us.

225
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:51,022
By the way, Hollywood just happens
to be in L.A. where May Fong lives.

226
00:16:51,207 --> 00:16:53,984
I'm not ready for that.
She's crowding me as it is.

227
00:16:54,168 --> 00:16:57,823
Crowding you?! She's been
your lnternet pal for three years.

228
00:16:58,008 --> 00:17:00,210
You haven't even met her!

229
00:17:00,464 --> 00:17:03,627
Look, man. What about me, man?
I have a business here.

230
00:17:03,808 --> 00:17:06,796
If things work out,
we can open a Quikee Burger in L.A.

231
00:17:06,976 --> 00:17:11,094
Yeah, or better yet, maybe
you can get in the movie biz too.

232
00:17:11,269 --> 00:17:13,424
What am I gonna do
in the movie business?

233
00:17:13,604 --> 00:17:17,423
I don't know. You could be
my stunt double.

234
00:17:17,606 --> 00:17:19,303
-Your stunt double?
-Yeah.

235
00:17:19,485 --> 00:17:23,222
If I gotta do, like, a dangerous stunt,
you could do it...

236
00:17:23,401 --> 00:17:25,603
...so that I don't get hurt.

237
00:17:27,324 --> 00:17:31,858
Come on. I need to do this
while I still can. I'm getting old, Bob.

238
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,159
-Walt, you're 32.
-Going on 50.

239
00:17:34,331 --> 00:17:37,319
Listen, I can't help it
you got most of our liver. Okay?

240
00:17:37,501 --> 00:17:40,030
I'm aging faster.
I got bags under my eyes.

241
00:17:40,215 --> 00:17:44,198
And you? Time's passing. You got
nothing to show except for pictures.

242
00:17:44,384 --> 00:17:48,502
-You haven't been laid in five years.
-Hey, how would you know?

243
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:54,302
I don't know, Walt.

244
00:17:54,556 --> 00:17:57,801
You know,
we got a great thing going here.

245
00:17:57,981 --> 00:18:00,840
-lt might not be the same--
-lt might be better!

246
00:18:01,025 --> 00:18:03,590
Have you ever thought about that?

247
00:18:03,775 --> 00:18:06,259
Three months, we go,
we see how it works out.

248
00:18:06,445 --> 00:18:10,300
If it doesn't, we come home.
I'll be happy because I know we tried.

249
00:18:17,288 --> 00:18:19,817
Okay, Hollywood...

250
00:18:20,082 --> 00:18:23,070
...but you're gonna owe me
bigtime for this.

251
00:18:49,151 --> 00:18:50,848
Bye.

252
00:18:52,114 --> 00:18:53,894
Bye, Bob.

253
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:08,745
You sure this is the right
Hollywood and Vine?

254
00:20:08,933 --> 00:20:12,261
-According to the brochure, it is.
-Show us your power, Lord.

255
00:20:12,435 --> 00:20:17,802
Lord, Lord, hates the sin,
but loves the sinner.

256
00:20:17,983 --> 00:20:21,311
-Show us your truth, Jesus.
-Holy smokes.

257
00:20:22,112 --> 00:20:24,179
Hey, freaks!

258
00:20:24,363 --> 00:20:26,060
Yo!

259
00:20:33,873 --> 00:20:35,904
Hello!

260
00:20:51,057 --> 00:20:52,459
Fade out!

261
00:20:52,639 --> 00:20:54,371
My wife's not out there, is she?

262
00:20:55,933 --> 00:20:58,088
No, I haven't seen anybody.

263
00:21:00,688 --> 00:21:02,667
That psycho midget's
been riding my ass...

264
00:21:02,856 --> 00:21:06,839
...to finish this screenplay I've been
working on for the last two years.

265
00:21:10,949 --> 00:21:12,811
This is it.

266
00:21:12,993 --> 00:21:14,690
Clean sheets and towels.

267
00:21:15,578 --> 00:21:18,437
There'll be a pot of green tea
in the office every morning.

268
00:21:18,622 --> 00:21:21,282
-Name's Moe if you need anything.
-This is great.

269
00:21:21,457 --> 00:21:24,199
Do you have a room
with a double bed?

270
00:21:24,668 --> 00:21:26,318
Sorry, this is all I got.

271
00:21:26,546 --> 00:21:28,613
But tell you what I can do...

272
00:21:28,797 --> 00:21:32,534
...I'll see if I can get a queen bed
in here in about a week or two.

273
00:21:34,012 --> 00:21:36,836
-See you guys.
-Thanks, Moe.

274
00:21:47,108 --> 00:21:49,850
Give her a call.
Let her know we're here.

275
00:21:50,026 --> 00:21:51,676
What--?

276
00:21:52,279 --> 00:21:55,560
This is serious. We have
a lot of things to do out here.

277
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:59,068
Not the least of which
is get you into a casting agency...

278
00:21:59,242 --> 00:22:01,643
...without them laughing you
out of the room.

279
00:22:01,829 --> 00:22:03,479
Why would they laugh?

280
00:22:03,663 --> 00:22:05,277
I mean, look at you.

281
00:22:05,456 --> 00:22:09,527
You're pale as a ghost.
We gotta get you a tan.

282
00:22:10,586 --> 00:22:15,654
Okay, what's a four-letter word
for voiceless, ends in D?

283
00:22:16,094 --> 00:22:17,791
-Surd.
-Surd?

284
00:22:17,967 --> 00:22:20,034
Surd with a U.

285
00:22:23,516 --> 00:22:27,922
I gotta tell you, this crossword's a lot
easier than the one I'm used to at home.

286
00:22:32,775 --> 00:22:36,676
Well, well, well,
what do we have here?

287
00:22:37,737 --> 00:22:39,434
-Hey!
-Hi.

288
00:22:39,612 --> 00:22:42,308
-Are you new around here?
-Got in this morning.

289
00:22:42,492 --> 00:22:45,853
-My name's Walt.
-Hey, I'm April.

290
00:22:46,036 --> 00:22:49,443
-This is my brother, Bob.
-Hey. Bob Tenor.

291
00:22:49,872 --> 00:22:51,357
Have a seat.

292
00:22:51,542 --> 00:22:53,074
So you guys are brand-new.

293
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:57,285
-Our first California sunburn.
-We're official.

294
00:22:57,505 --> 00:22:59,484
You're gonna love it here
at the Star.

295
00:22:59,672 --> 00:23:02,660
I've been here, like,
two and a half years, and--

296
00:23:02,842 --> 00:23:06,284
Hey, you guys are stuck together.
And I still love it here.

297
00:23:06,471 --> 00:23:08,450
We're like one big happy family.

298
00:23:08,639 --> 00:23:10,841
So where'd you get this done?

299
00:23:12,562 --> 00:23:14,799
No, no, we were born like this.

300
00:23:14,979 --> 00:23:17,838
Cool. Cool.
And where are you guys from?

301
00:23:18,023 --> 00:23:21,548
Massachusetts.
Bob here's a lover/grillman...

302
00:23:21,734 --> 00:23:24,558
...and I came out
to give acting a shot.

303
00:23:25,281 --> 00:23:28,269
Oh, my God! I'm an actor too.

304
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:30,147
-Oh, yeah?
-You're an actor?

305
00:23:30,327 --> 00:23:32,892
Yeah. Well, no.
I mean, I want to be one.

306
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:35,528
Right now I'm just
kind of a lingerie model.

307
00:23:35,707 --> 00:23:37,192
Oh, my God! So am l.

308
00:23:38,252 --> 00:23:40,319
No, he isn't.

309
00:23:40,504 --> 00:23:42,988
No, seriously, like,
do you have an agent?

310
00:23:43,171 --> 00:23:44,985
No, no, not yet. How about you?

311
00:23:45,175 --> 00:23:47,541
No, not momentarily,
but I did have one.

312
00:23:47,718 --> 00:23:50,247
This colostomy bag
named Morty O'Reilly.

313
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:52,795
-Hey, you want a beer?
-Yeah.

314
00:23:53,348 --> 00:23:58,845
I've had better luck on my own.
Every morning I read Back Stage West.

315
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:00,341
-Can I see?
-Yeah.

316
00:24:00,521 --> 00:24:03,134
And it lists all the open casting calls.

317
00:24:03,981 --> 00:24:06,805
Yeah, you don't even need
an agent with that thing.

318
00:24:07,238 --> 00:24:09,722
Bob, check this out. Right here.

319
00:24:09,903 --> 00:24:12,468
"Wanted: Tall, handsome,
distinguished actor...

320
00:24:12,657 --> 00:24:15,141
...to play Robin Hood
for the new millennium."

321
00:24:15,329 --> 00:24:16,731
-That's you!
-That is me!

322
00:24:16,911 --> 00:24:18,890
-That is you!
-ls that me?

323
00:24:19,081 --> 00:24:20,895
-Yeah, it's you!
-lt is me.

324
00:24:22,625 --> 00:24:24,239
You guys are fun.

325
00:24:24,418 --> 00:24:27,990
Listen, ye all, and hear me now.

326
00:24:29,299 --> 00:24:31,783
The sheriff of Nottingham
will come forth...

327
00:24:31,967 --> 00:24:35,868
...but he will not bend
this merry band of--

328
00:24:36,055 --> 00:24:37,951
Of brothers!

329
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:40,042
He will--

330
00:24:40,933 --> 00:24:42,665
Who put you up to this?

331
00:24:42,853 --> 00:24:45,630
It was Lovett over at CAA,
wasn't it?

332
00:24:46,188 --> 00:24:50,171
Joan, get that SOB on the horn
for me, will you, please?

333
00:24:50,651 --> 00:24:53,680
Did you bring a headshot
and list of your credits?

334
00:24:54,028 --> 00:24:58,235
You know, I was supposed to do that,
and I forgot it at home.

335
00:24:59,658 --> 00:25:03,313
Sometimes I think he'd forget
his own brother if I wasn't sewn on.

336
00:25:05,081 --> 00:25:08,771
Okay, thank you for coming.
We'll be in touch.

337
00:25:11,087 --> 00:25:12,408
No.

338
00:25:37,529 --> 00:25:41,136
I'm sorry, but the message
that we're trying to get across...

339
00:25:41,322 --> 00:25:47,652
...is that Dubble Bubble doubles
the taste, not causes birth defects.

340
00:25:51,166 --> 00:25:54,025
I don't know.
Maybe you were right, Bob.

341
00:25:54,211 --> 00:25:56,155
Maybe this is a pipe dream.

342
00:25:56,335 --> 00:26:00,271
Yeah. Probably time to face facts.

343
00:26:00,466 --> 00:26:03,325
If you haven't made it
in the first 72 hours...

344
00:26:03,511 --> 00:26:06,918
-...you should probably just pack it in.
-Right.

345
00:26:07,096 --> 00:26:11,630
I bet Meryl Streep wasn't out here
six hours before she got her big break.

346
00:26:11,809 --> 00:26:13,876
De Niro too.

347
00:26:14,061 --> 00:26:16,674
And Steve Buscemi?
With his pearly whites...

348
00:26:16,854 --> 00:26:20,017
...he was in town 45 minutes
before he got his first role.

349
00:26:20,193 --> 00:26:22,722
-Are you making fun of me?
-You bet I am.

350
00:26:22,901 --> 00:26:27,636
I know you were born without a liver,
but you got some backbone, didn't you?

351
00:26:28,699 --> 00:26:33,398
-You gotta admit these past couple of--
-I'm not gonna admit anything.

352
00:26:33,578 --> 00:26:35,944
How do we know
the Lion King producers...

353
00:26:36,123 --> 00:26:39,813
...aren't looking for some
conjoined hyenas as we speak?

354
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,650
Know who will get the part now?

355
00:26:41,836 --> 00:26:45,491
Those Schappell sisters from Oregon
who are stuck at the forehead.

356
00:26:45,674 --> 00:26:47,958
Why? They're country-and-western
singers, not actors.

357
00:26:48,134 --> 00:26:51,333
Because you quit, that's why.

358
00:26:52,096 --> 00:26:53,828
Right.

359
00:26:54,973 --> 00:26:58,828
-Maybe I was a little hasty.
-Good.

360
00:26:59,187 --> 00:27:01,424
Hey, don't worry about anything.

361
00:27:01,604 --> 00:27:07,135
I happen to have a little plan that's going
into effect first thing tomorrow morning.

362
00:27:08,986 --> 00:27:11,387
All right.
You're a great brother, Bob.

363
00:27:11,571 --> 00:27:15,642
Yeah, I know, now zip the lip.
Let's get some sleep.

364
00:27:23,707 --> 00:27:25,686
I like your plan.

365
00:27:25,876 --> 00:27:30,164
The car's only plan A.
Plan B is to get you an agent.

366
00:27:30,339 --> 00:27:32,071
Right.

367
00:27:34,926 --> 00:27:37,914
Retirement home? Are you sure
we got the right address?

368
00:27:38,095 --> 00:27:40,074
This is what he gave me.

369
00:27:40,266 --> 00:27:45,334
Maybe we should try someone else.
April said this Morty guy's a total sleaze.

370
00:27:45,647 --> 00:27:49,502
But you said he's the only one
that would give us an appointment.

371
00:27:51,192 --> 00:27:52,842
I want you to know up front...

372
00:27:53,026 --> 00:27:57,349
...that O'Reilly only represents actors
who are truly committed to their craft.

373
00:27:57,531 --> 00:28:01,221
That's me, Mr. O'Reilly.
I am fully committed.

374
00:28:01,409 --> 00:28:04,737
Committed enough to pay
my $200 up-front service fee?

375
00:28:04,913 --> 00:28:09,201
Which, of course, is used to defray
the costs of registration fees...

376
00:28:09,377 --> 00:28:11,825
...entitlement paperwork
and what have you.

377
00:28:12,002 --> 00:28:15,330
-What are you doing?
-I'm showing him how committed I am.

378
00:28:15,505 --> 00:28:18,750
You're showing him
how stupid you are. Here.

379
00:28:19,801 --> 00:28:24,089
We'll give you $100 because
you're only representing one of us.

380
00:28:24,264 --> 00:28:26,501
Look, I'm gonna level with you.

381
00:28:26,682 --> 00:28:29,295
Siamese twins
ain't the easiest sell I've had.

382
00:28:29,479 --> 00:28:31,681
We're not Siamese. We're American.

383
00:28:31,855 --> 00:28:37,141
I think what my brother's saying is,
he'd prefer the term "conjoined twins."

384
00:28:37,317 --> 00:28:39,261
Okay, but I should let you know...

385
00:28:39,445 --> 00:28:44,647
...I'm not one of those run-of-the-mill
suits. I'm a full-service agent.

386
00:28:45,786 --> 00:28:48,482
-Meaning?
-I get 25 percent.

387
00:28:48,663 --> 00:28:52,270
-Well, what does he get in return?
-Seventy-five percent.

388
00:28:52,582 --> 00:28:56,319
Well, I gotta tell you,
I think he seemed like a real player.

389
00:28:56,626 --> 00:28:58,570
I guess.

390
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,859
Oh, my God. It's her.

391
00:29:02,299 --> 00:29:03,996
Who?

392
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:07,706
Don't, don't, don't, don't gawk.
Don't do that.

393
00:29:07,888 --> 00:29:10,548
She's famous. She probably
hates when people gawk.

394
00:29:14,602 --> 00:29:17,298
I like that part, but I just....

395
00:29:17,855 --> 00:29:20,256
I think we gotta at least go by
and say hi.

396
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:23,100
A minute ago,
we couldn't even look at her...

397
00:29:23,277 --> 00:29:28,222
-...and now we're gonna go say hello?
-Hey, Bob, relax. It would be rude not to.

398
00:29:28,574 --> 00:29:30,729
I'll do all the talking.

399
00:29:35,289 --> 00:29:37,356
Excuse me, Ms. Streep.

400
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:39,859
Sorry to interrupt your lunch.

401
00:29:40,042 --> 00:29:43,156
I know this is completely
inappropriate...

402
00:29:44,756 --> 00:29:49,655
...but my brother Bob
is a big fan of yours. He just--

403
00:29:49,842 --> 00:29:52,371
He wanted to come by and say hi.

404
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:57,331
-Hi.
-Hi, Bob.

405
00:29:57,974 --> 00:30:01,003
We're from Oak Bluffs
on Martha's Vineyard.

406
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:03,799
I've been there.

407
00:30:03,981 --> 00:30:09,806
Yeah, I know you have. Actually,
we're friends with Timmy Sheehan.

408
00:30:10,739 --> 00:30:12,553
-Who?
-Timmy Sheehan.

409
00:30:13,406 --> 00:30:17,261
Remember, he waited on you one time
at Jimmy Sea's restaurant?

410
00:30:17,452 --> 00:30:19,689
Remember? You autographed
his menu for him.

411
00:30:19,872 --> 00:30:21,734
I did.

412
00:30:22,458 --> 00:30:24,613
I know because
I read it and it said:

413
00:30:24,792 --> 00:30:27,821
"To Timmy, a good waiter.
From Meryl Streep."

414
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,824
But the way you signed the P,
it looked like an L...

415
00:30:31,005 --> 00:30:33,864
...so we used to call Timmy
all the time and say:

416
00:30:34,049 --> 00:30:38,748
"Hello, this is Meryl Streel calling."
We were just busting his nuts.

417
00:30:39,347 --> 00:30:41,466
True story.

418
00:30:41,725 --> 00:30:44,338
I think I remember him.

419
00:30:44,684 --> 00:30:48,339
I ordered some food,
and he brought it to me.

420
00:30:48,771 --> 00:30:52,508
That would be him.
He's a real character.

421
00:30:52,694 --> 00:30:56,812
I can't believe you just come
to a restaurant and nobody bugs you.

422
00:30:57,866 --> 00:30:59,728
Well....

423
00:31:00,993 --> 00:31:02,725
Let's go.

424
00:31:02,952 --> 00:31:05,858
Well, let me go.

425
00:31:06,039 --> 00:31:07,983
Nice meeting you.

426
00:31:10,625 --> 00:31:14,397
You know, by the way,
if you ever just wanna...

427
00:31:15,339 --> 00:31:19,909
...get away, have a little hang time,
we're at the Rising Star apartments.

428
00:31:20,091 --> 00:31:22,915
It is a pretty sweet setup.

429
00:31:23,093 --> 00:31:26,618
We got a barbecue pit there.
Gas. He does steaks and chops.

430
00:31:26,809 --> 00:31:32,258
We got a pool, a little grassy knoll area,
and feel free to just come by any time.

431
00:31:32,436 --> 00:31:34,591
Okay. I'll keep it in mind.

432
00:31:34,773 --> 00:31:36,892
-Great. And bring the posse.
-Okay.

433
00:31:37,068 --> 00:31:38,964
Bring the posse.

434
00:31:42,321 --> 00:31:44,101
Hey!

435
00:31:45,448 --> 00:31:48,938
Wait a minute.
I do remember you guys.

436
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,780
Homecoming '87.
Oh, my God! I was at that game.

437
00:31:53,372 --> 00:31:56,653
With seconds on the clock,
it's fourth down, one yard to go.

438
00:31:58,377 --> 00:32:00,861
-Safety cheating.
-Check. Check.

439
00:32:01,048 --> 00:32:04,867
Check. Check.
Apache 36. Apache 36.

440
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:08,378
Apache 36. Apache 36.

441
00:32:08,554 --> 00:32:10,005
Okay, let's go.

442
00:32:11,975 --> 00:32:13,789
Hike.

443
00:32:14,853 --> 00:32:17,055
I'm wide open.

444
00:32:19,438 --> 00:32:24,420
Touchdown, Vineyard.
Sharks win, 22-21.

445
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:25,631
That was you!

446
00:32:25,821 --> 00:32:28,809
He actually is the one who scored
the winning touchdown.

447
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:31,021
Well, you threw him
a hell of a block.

448
00:32:31,409 --> 00:32:35,650
I've always told you that.
You never give yourself enough credit.

449
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:41,190
As you can see, I'm on crutches.
I was wounded during the Vietnam War.

450
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:45,113
Had a hunting accident
while hiding in Canada.

451
00:32:45,712 --> 00:32:48,241
Tried that Viagra stuff the other day.

452
00:32:48,425 --> 00:32:51,670
I didn't get an erection,
but I could walk for three hours.

453
00:32:51,842 --> 00:32:54,044
Did a benefit for
Jehovah Witnesses...

454
00:32:54,223 --> 00:32:57,551
...all's they wanted to hear
were "knock, knock" jokes.

455
00:33:01,436 --> 00:33:05,208
Then the three of us just sat there
and talked for, like, an hour.

456
00:33:05,399 --> 00:33:07,466
Meryl--
She asked me to call her Meryl.

457
00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:11,505
Very knowledgeable on the film industry.
She says I should plug away...

458
00:33:11,694 --> 00:33:15,022
...because I have twice the presence
of most actors she's met.

459
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,601
-Well, you do.
-Thanks.

460
00:33:17,785 --> 00:33:21,066
Anyway, I told her my first love's
the theater back home...

461
00:33:21,248 --> 00:33:23,485
...felt I had to give
Hollywood a crack...

462
00:33:23,666 --> 00:33:28,072
...but if I ever go back, I should call her.
She's dying to go to the Vineyard.

463
00:33:28,254 --> 00:33:30,233
She might even star
in a show with me.

464
00:33:30,422 --> 00:33:33,499
-Really? Walt, that's great!
-I know.

465
00:33:33,674 --> 00:33:36,158
I love it when famous people
are not dickwads.

466
00:33:36,344 --> 00:33:41,079
That's the Streeper, perfectly normal.
As normal as you and me.

467
00:33:41,846 --> 00:33:44,623
Stop. Anyway....

468
00:33:45,726 --> 00:33:49,087
-Can I ask you a personal question?
-Nine inches.

469
00:33:49,854 --> 00:33:52,419
I wasn't gonna ask that.
Nine inches?

470
00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:54,812
Yeah, it's about nine inches across.

471
00:33:54,984 --> 00:33:57,680
No, actually, what I was
gonna ask you is...

472
00:33:57,863 --> 00:34:01,353
...if you guys ever considered,
you know, getting separated?

473
00:34:01,534 --> 00:34:05,940
There's a lot of great plastic surgeons
here. A lot. I mean, just look at these.

474
00:34:06,704 --> 00:34:11,439
Well, our problem can't really be fixed
through a simple cosmetic surgery.

475
00:34:11,627 --> 00:34:13,694
We share a liver.
He's got most of it.

476
00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:17,782
There's no way they can just nip
and tuck so you both get some?

477
00:34:17,963 --> 00:34:19,284
There is and there isn't.

478
00:34:19,465 --> 00:34:25,877
The doctors at Mass General told us
they could split us up at no risk to Bob...

479
00:34:26,055 --> 00:34:29,383
...but there's a 50-50 chance
that I wouldn't make it, so....

480
00:34:29,559 --> 00:34:32,301
Oh, God, no.
I don't blame you for not doing it.

481
00:34:32,481 --> 00:34:35,644
No! No, no, no, I wanted to do it.
Bob wouldn't allow it.

482
00:34:38,405 --> 00:34:39,726
Oh, Bob.

483
00:34:41,697 --> 00:34:45,516
Yeah. He's really something.

484
00:34:47,952 --> 00:34:50,894
Hey, are you even sure
you need a liver?

485
00:34:51,078 --> 00:34:53,479
My friend had his appendix out
and he's okay.

486
00:34:54,706 --> 00:34:59,029
Okay. I'm gonna
take a little sleepy now.

487
00:34:59,547 --> 00:35:01,197
Good night.

488
00:35:08,386 --> 00:35:10,453
I'm not here.

489
00:35:11,386 --> 00:35:13,036
Hello.

490
00:35:14,099 --> 00:35:19,713
No, he is currently unavailable.
Can I take a message?

491
00:35:20,148 --> 00:35:22,890
-Oh, hey, Morty.
-I'm here. I'm here. I'm here.

492
00:35:23,066 --> 00:35:27,222
You know, l--
He is waking up from his afternoon nap.

493
00:35:27,404 --> 00:35:28,855
Hold on, please.

494
00:35:29,029 --> 00:35:30,679
Hello!

495
00:35:32,282 --> 00:35:35,359
You're kidding me. What--?

496
00:35:35,537 --> 00:35:37,821
Of course I'll be there.

497
00:35:38,792 --> 00:35:42,234
Thank you, Mr. O'Reilly.
Thanks a lot.

498
00:35:43,795 --> 00:35:45,739
I got a job.

499
00:35:46,212 --> 00:35:47,862
What?

500
00:35:48,381 --> 00:35:50,782
It's a motion picture
called Pavlov's Dog!

501
00:35:50,967 --> 00:35:53,663
I start tomorrow morning
at 9:00 a.m.!

502
00:35:53,846 --> 00:35:56,165
Do you hear that, Bob?
I'm a working actor!

503
00:35:56,346 --> 00:35:57,996
Great!

504
00:35:58,181 --> 00:36:00,043
Hey, it gets even better.

505
00:36:00,728 --> 00:36:04,583
In five minutes, you have a date
with the girl of your dreams.

506
00:36:06,943 --> 00:36:08,593
Bobby!

507
00:36:08,777 --> 00:36:10,427
Come on.

508
00:36:10,987 --> 00:36:12,637
Bobby.

509
00:36:14,198 --> 00:36:17,443
Would you calm down?
I thought you'd be happy about this.

510
00:36:17,619 --> 00:36:19,351
Oh, God. How could you?

511
00:36:19,536 --> 00:36:21,398
-How could you?
-lt was easy.

512
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:26,231
I called information, I got her number,
and I called her before you woke up.

513
00:36:26,458 --> 00:36:28,108
Thank you.

514
00:36:31,796 --> 00:36:36,084
No, she is from California, Walt,
she's not used to Siamese twins.

515
00:36:36,258 --> 00:36:39,164
Siamese?
Hey, what happened to conjoined?

516
00:36:39,345 --> 00:36:43,798
Oh, just cut the bullshit!
We're gonna freak her out!

517
00:36:46,519 --> 00:36:48,299
Excuse me.

518
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:51,927
Hello?

519
00:37:04,117 --> 00:37:05,519
May I help you?

520
00:37:05,704 --> 00:37:08,446
Yeah, I'm looking for Bob Tenor.

521
00:37:09,748 --> 00:37:12,736
-Apartment five.
-Thank you.

522
00:37:14,378 --> 00:37:17,903
-Have you been honest with this girl?
-Yeah.

523
00:37:19,757 --> 00:37:21,736
-By and large.
-Well....

524
00:37:23,512 --> 00:37:27,719
-Didn't tell her about yourself, did you?
-Of course I did!

525
00:37:28,892 --> 00:37:30,506
I just....

526
00:37:31,519 --> 00:37:34,048
I didn't tell her about you.

527
00:37:42,405 --> 00:37:44,934
I can't deal with you right now.

528
00:37:53,413 --> 00:37:56,442
The pictures!
What about the pictures, Bob?

529
00:37:56,626 --> 00:37:59,532
-I cut you out of them.
-Oh, well, that's great!

530
00:37:59,712 --> 00:38:04,035
That is really, really great!
That says a lot, brother.

531
00:38:04,549 --> 00:38:08,756
-Ashamed of me, huh?
-No, I'm not ashamed of you.

532
00:38:11,388 --> 00:38:15,078
I just don't know how I feel
about myself sometimes.

533
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:24,837
-Okay, okay, okay.
-What am I gonna do?

534
00:38:25,026 --> 00:38:28,798
-We'll go out the back window.
-Yeah, okay, we'll make a run for it.

535
00:38:28,988 --> 00:38:31,190
We're not running anywhere.

536
00:38:50,884 --> 00:38:53,743
Hey! Where have you been hiding?

537
00:38:55,724 --> 00:38:57,961
Hi, Bob.

538
00:38:58,182 --> 00:39:02,118
-Just go ahead and tell her.
-Live your own life.

539
00:39:02,309 --> 00:39:04,123
Hop in!

540
00:39:06,148 --> 00:39:09,090
Well, well, we finally meet.

541
00:39:09,692 --> 00:39:15,025
-I can't believe you're actually here.
-Yeah, I know. It's amazing, huh?

542
00:39:15,196 --> 00:39:17,515
You look a lot bigger
than in your photos.

543
00:39:17,742 --> 00:39:21,983
Well, I would hope so,
or else I'd only be three inches tall.

544
00:39:28,292 --> 00:39:31,653
Hi, I'm Bob's brother, Walt.
I spoke to you on the phone.

545
00:39:31,836 --> 00:39:33,486
Walt, meet May.

546
00:39:34,341 --> 00:39:36,825
Nice to meet you, Walt.

547
00:39:37,009 --> 00:39:42,506
-You never told me you had a brother.
-I never told you I had a brother.

548
00:39:43,558 --> 00:39:46,300
Are we going somewhere?

549
00:39:46,474 --> 00:39:51,209
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
I made dinner reservations.

550
00:39:53,024 --> 00:39:55,091
Tenor, party of three.

551
00:39:55,317 --> 00:39:58,094
I believe we had an 8:1 5 reservation.

552
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:02,263
-Can I help you?
-We'll have two Jumbo Jacks, please.

553
00:40:02,450 --> 00:40:06,938
A Sourdough Jack, three fries,
and three medium Pepsis.

554
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:11,103
-Two Jumbo Jacks, one Sourdough,,,
-Got a favorite parking spot here, Bob?

555
00:40:11,290 --> 00:40:13,445
,,, three medium Pepsis,
Anything else?

556
00:40:25,428 --> 00:40:28,789
-So how was the trip here?
-Oh, awesome, awesome flight.

557
00:40:28,974 --> 00:40:31,375
Yeah, you should've seen it.
We played cards.

558
00:40:31,559 --> 00:40:33,925
-Cards are fun.
-Yeah.

559
00:40:36,147 --> 00:40:37,632
Grand Canyon.

560
00:40:37,816 --> 00:40:41,306
-We flew right over the Grand Canyon.
-Oh, yeah?

561
00:40:41,485 --> 00:40:45,938
Yeah, it's, like, real different from
the Vineyard, with the big hole and shit.

562
00:40:46,115 --> 00:40:48,146
And it was orange.

563
00:40:56,792 --> 00:40:59,869
Do you guys remember
that Allen movie, Annie Hall...

564
00:41:00,045 --> 00:41:03,617
...where the guy goes out with the girl
and to ease the tension...

565
00:41:03,797 --> 00:41:07,125
...he suggests they kiss
at the beginning of the date.

566
00:41:07,301 --> 00:41:08,951
-Yes!
-Do you remember this?

567
00:41:09,136 --> 00:41:11,995
-That's a really good scene.
-The best is when...

568
00:41:12,179 --> 00:41:15,751
...Diane Keaton's brother says he's
gonna drive into the truck...

569
00:41:15,932 --> 00:41:18,545
...and kill everybody in the car.

570
00:41:22,356 --> 00:41:24,006
Yeah.

571
00:41:32,115 --> 00:41:34,775
May, I think there's something
I should tell you.

572
00:41:34,951 --> 00:41:36,601
Yes.

573
00:41:37,204 --> 00:41:38,901
Go ahead.

574
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:43,402
You see, the reason
that I'm acting kind of strange--

575
00:41:45,335 --> 00:41:47,948
-I think I'm dying!
-Lord.

576
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:49,944
-I think-- I can't--
-Are you okay?

577
00:41:50,132 --> 00:41:51,994
-I can't breathe!
-Oh, my God.

578
00:41:52,175 --> 00:41:53,496
Should we get out?

579
00:41:53,675 --> 00:41:56,838
No, you're having a panic attack.
Here, breathe into this.

580
00:41:57,014 --> 00:41:58,876
-You don't like me, do you?
-What?

581
00:41:59,057 --> 00:42:00,707
You're disappointed with me.

582
00:42:00,893 --> 00:42:04,092
No! No, you're awesome!
You're even better in person!

583
00:42:04,269 --> 00:42:05,590
-No, I'm not.
-Yes!

584
00:42:05,772 --> 00:42:08,301
Oh, yeah.
You're a hottie. Absolutely.

585
00:42:08,482 --> 00:42:11,972
Just breathe into there.
No, no, no. Oh, God, I'm, I'm, I'm--

586
00:42:12,151 --> 00:42:17,728
I'm so embarrassed. I waited so long
to meet you, and now I'm blowing it.

587
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:19,607
-No! No.
-No. No.

588
00:42:19,784 --> 00:42:22,068
You're not blowing anything.
No blowing.

589
00:42:22,245 --> 00:42:26,401
You're so much better than I could--
I'm actually happy you're having this...

590
00:42:26,581 --> 00:42:29,146
...because it means
we have even more in common.

591
00:42:29,333 --> 00:42:32,192
-I freak out too.
-He does.

592
00:42:32,378 --> 00:42:35,155
-You really have panic attacks?
-Oh, all the time.

593
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:40,075
I was actually just about to have one,
and then you beat me to the punch.

594
00:42:53,272 --> 00:42:56,386
Hey, sorry...

595
00:42:56,943 --> 00:43:00,142
...to have Walt here
tagging along on our date.

596
00:43:00,363 --> 00:43:04,346
You know, he can be a little clingy.

597
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:08,100
You know, it's his first time
out on the Left Coast...

598
00:43:08,286 --> 00:43:12,442
...and, you know,
he's heard about the gangs...

599
00:43:12,666 --> 00:43:15,231
...and the Crips and the Bloods, and....

600
00:43:15,418 --> 00:43:19,354
I was less nervous about it.
I actually looked into joining the Crips.

601
00:43:19,547 --> 00:43:23,154
But I found that the Bloods
had a better dental plan.

602
00:43:24,384 --> 00:43:27,874
No. No, sir, that's not true.
They wouldn't take me.

603
00:43:34,604 --> 00:43:37,885
-I had a lot of fun tonight, Bob.
-Yeah, me too.

604
00:43:39,606 --> 00:43:42,219
Well, anyway...

605
00:43:42,402 --> 00:43:45,892
-...I guess this is it.
-Yep.

606
00:43:51,077 --> 00:43:54,732
Will you walk me to the door?

607
00:43:55,706 --> 00:43:58,366
-I wanna get out and stretch my legs.
-Sure, sure.

608
00:43:58,542 --> 00:44:00,192
Yeah.

609
00:44:02,213 --> 00:44:04,450
The sidewalk's safer.

610
00:44:07,048 --> 00:44:10,247
I'm gonna walk you guys
right to the front door.

611
00:44:10,428 --> 00:44:14,916
This is beautiful, by the way.
I got an early-morning call time.

612
00:44:18,810 --> 00:44:23,961
-Good luck tomorrow, Walt.
-Oh, thank you very much. Thanks.

613
00:44:24,983 --> 00:44:30,350
You guys have probably seen enough
of me. I'll just get out of your hair.

614
00:44:48,964 --> 00:44:52,245
-Good night, Bob.
-Good night, May.

615
00:45:05,478 --> 00:45:08,220
-Yes! Yes!
-Hey. Hey, hey.

616
00:45:09,522 --> 00:45:11,501
-Good kisser?
-Yeah, I'm not bad.

617
00:45:11,690 --> 00:45:14,350
-Oh, that's good. That's cute.
-That is good, huh?

618
00:45:14,529 --> 00:45:17,517
-No, no, no! It's not funny! Come on.
-Who's your daddy?

619
00:45:17,697 --> 00:45:20,226
-You're my daddy.
-That's it.

620
00:45:20,576 --> 00:45:23,564
-So, what's this Pavlov's Dog about?
-I don't know.

621
00:45:23,746 --> 00:45:25,360
They didn't send me a script.

622
00:45:25,538 --> 00:45:29,028
Probably one of those Disney movies
with the talking animals.

623
00:45:29,209 --> 00:45:30,660
"I'm Pavlov."

624
00:45:30,834 --> 00:45:34,653
-Hey, great makeup job, fellas!
-Thanks. You too.

625
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:41,835
Am I just talking to hear
my brains rattle? I'm hot!

626
00:45:42,013 --> 00:45:43,875
Do you hear me? I am hot!

627
00:45:44,058 --> 00:45:47,913
Look what it says here, Howard.
Who's hot, who's not. Cher, red-hot!

628
00:45:50,853 --> 00:45:54,708
You're hotter than hot! You're on fire.
There's no question about it.

629
00:45:54,941 --> 00:45:58,348
Then answer me this. Why am I doing
this lame-ass TV show...

630
00:45:58,527 --> 00:46:02,382
-...when I should be doing movies?
-Because you signed a contract...

631
00:46:02,571 --> 00:46:06,778
...and the network's holding you to it.
Honey and the Beaze isn't lame-ass.

632
00:46:06,952 --> 00:46:09,648
You're a sassy lawyer
who uses DNA evidence...

633
00:46:09,828 --> 00:46:13,565
...to free wrongly convicted minorities.
This is cutting-edge stuff.

634
00:46:13,792 --> 00:46:16,616
Oh, cut the crap, Howard.
Come on, this TV show...

635
00:46:16,792 --> 00:46:19,906
...makes Touched by an Angel
look like Trainspotting!

636
00:46:20,131 --> 00:46:23,986
Before I busted my nut to get you
this gig, you were two weeks away...

637
00:46:24,177 --> 00:46:28,160
-...from being the corner square?
-Center square.

638
00:46:28,347 --> 00:46:30,960
You told me they wanted me
for center square.

639
00:46:32,225 --> 00:46:35,962
I did say that.
And you see, what happened is...

640
00:46:36,146 --> 00:46:39,671
...Alf was able to free up his schedule,
and, well, they want--

641
00:46:39,856 --> 00:46:44,755
If you didn't get lucky with one lousy
indie film, you'd be begging for this job.

642
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:47,893
Let me explain something
to you, okay?

643
00:46:48,074 --> 00:46:52,109
First, that lousy little indie film
has grossed over 200 million dollars!

644
00:46:52,285 --> 00:46:56,526
And secondly, I don't beg.
And you know why I don't beg?

645
00:46:56,706 --> 00:47:01,029
-No.
-Because I am a fucking Oscar winner!

646
00:47:02,210 --> 00:47:03,860
Cher.

647
00:47:04,337 --> 00:47:06,233
Oh, hi.
Can I help you?

648
00:47:08,092 --> 00:47:11,699
Sorry, we're looking for stage 32,
and a little lost.

649
00:47:11,887 --> 00:47:15,659
Thirty-- There's no 30--
Let me have a look at that.

650
00:47:17,476 --> 00:47:21,001
You're on the wrong lot. You want
stage 32 at Half-Mast Studios.

651
00:47:21,188 --> 00:47:23,343
-That's across the street.
-Oh, well....

652
00:47:23,523 --> 00:47:27,048
So that would explain
why the guard was shooting at us.

653
00:47:27,567 --> 00:47:29,546
Sorry to bother you.

654
00:47:30,946 --> 00:47:32,808
What?

655
00:47:34,159 --> 00:47:35,856
You're Cher.

656
00:47:36,451 --> 00:47:38,653
-Oh, boy.
-l-- Sorry. I'm sorry.

657
00:47:38,829 --> 00:47:41,394
-I'm just a bi-- I'm a big fan. Big.
-He is.

658
00:47:41,580 --> 00:47:44,743
Big fan of your work.
And I'm an actor too.

659
00:47:44,958 --> 00:47:50,074
-You guys are an actor?
-No, no. Not him. Not him. Just me.

660
00:47:50,255 --> 00:47:52,410
-I'm a short-order cook back East.
-Yeah.

661
00:47:52,590 --> 00:47:57,124
He does that, and I'm out here right now
just kind of going through it, you know?

662
00:47:57,304 --> 00:48:01,545
Living it right now. It's going well too.
I got a couple of things going on.

663
00:48:01,723 --> 00:48:04,124
I'm doing a gig
across the street, actually.

664
00:48:04,312 --> 00:48:08,084
I have an agent. Could I just trouble you
for an autograph?

665
00:48:08,315 --> 00:48:09,636
We're busy.

666
00:48:10,524 --> 00:48:14,765
-Right. Okay. No heat on that.
-Wrap it up.

667
00:48:14,944 --> 00:48:18,225
All right, well, just keep on keeping on.

668
00:48:18,990 --> 00:48:20,886
Do what you do.

669
00:48:24,705 --> 00:48:27,734
That really puts things into perspective,
doesn't it?

670
00:48:27,956 --> 00:48:33,899
"That really puts things into perspectiv--"
Just get me out of the stinking show!

671
00:48:34,712 --> 00:48:37,571
So this is your first job, huh?

672
00:48:37,757 --> 00:48:41,085
Yes. Yes, it is.
Actually, I was wondering...

673
00:48:41,262 --> 00:48:44,086
...is there somebody around
who might have a script?

674
00:48:44,263 --> 00:48:46,582
I haven't gone over my lines.

675
00:48:46,765 --> 00:48:49,249
They're just gonna set up
the scenes...

676
00:48:49,434 --> 00:48:52,597
...and then they're gonna let you all
just kind of wing it.

677
00:48:52,770 --> 00:48:56,460
Improv. This director
sounds very progressive.

678
00:48:56,690 --> 00:48:58,222
I guess.

679
00:48:58,404 --> 00:49:01,567
Who exactly is in this film?

680
00:49:01,736 --> 00:49:06,224
Phil Rupp, Lolly Gagger,
Marianna Trench...

681
00:49:06,410 --> 00:49:08,776
...and Rebecca Romaine-Staymoist.

682
00:49:10,996 --> 00:49:14,025
Phil Rupp.
Never heard of him.

683
00:49:14,250 --> 00:49:16,651
-You're kidding.
-No.

684
00:49:16,835 --> 00:49:20,325
You never heard of Phil Rupp?
Oh, he's done over 500 films.

685
00:49:21,591 --> 00:49:26,125
Hey, what exactly is Pavlov's Dog
about anyway?

686
00:49:27,803 --> 00:49:32,337
Pavlov's Dog? It isn't Pavlov's Dog.
It's Pavlov's--

687
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:35,588
--Dong. Scene 1 4, take one.

688
00:49:36,397 --> 00:49:37,848
And, action.

689
00:49:38,020 --> 00:49:42,176
That's it, Phil, you spring to life now.
Good. Excellent. A little more.

690
00:49:42,359 --> 00:49:45,055
Give me some more.
I want some more. Nice.

691
00:49:45,234 --> 00:49:48,515
Phil, you disappear now.
The freaks are gonna jump in...

692
00:49:48,698 --> 00:49:51,897
...and we discover the whole scene's
a horrible nightmare.

693
00:49:56,286 --> 00:49:58,770
Wait. Look, Cher,
if you break this contract...

694
00:49:58,957 --> 00:50:01,570
...they'll blackball the both of us.
You'll be finished.

695
00:50:01,751 --> 00:50:05,652
I don't give a goat's bobo
what it says on that thing.

696
00:50:08,090 --> 00:50:11,497
I knew we shouldn't have trusted
that bastard Morty.

697
00:50:11,678 --> 00:50:14,243
Maybe he didn't know
what the movie was about.

698
00:50:14,429 --> 00:50:17,171
He was the executive producer!

699
00:50:17,432 --> 00:50:18,753
Yeah.

700
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:22,683
Doesn't that contract say
I can choose my own co-star?

701
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:24,972
Yeah. So what?

702
00:50:25,438 --> 00:50:27,804
I just found my leading man.

703
00:50:27,984 --> 00:50:29,435
Men.

704
00:50:29,653 --> 00:50:32,395
What are you, frigging nuts?
Siamese twins!

705
00:50:32,613 --> 00:50:35,273
-The network'll never go for that.
-Exactly.

706
00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:38,308
That way they'll break the contract
and not me.

707
00:50:38,494 --> 00:50:40,649
Don't--
Cher, please, don't do this.

708
00:50:40,872 --> 00:50:43,273
Hey, guys! Guys?

709
00:50:43,498 --> 00:50:48,443
I just want to say that I am really sorry
for being a bitch back there...

710
00:50:48,672 --> 00:50:54,497
...but I was in the middle of being
balled out by my creepy manager...

711
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:57,795
...and I guess I took it out
on the wrong people.

712
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:14,972
Hi, Bob.

713
00:51:16,738 --> 00:51:18,106
Hi, May.

714
00:51:18,281 --> 00:51:20,682
Walt, what happened to your foot?

715
00:51:20,867 --> 00:51:23,896
I fell off my unicycle.

716
00:51:24,786 --> 00:51:28,358
-Easy.
-I sprained it pretty bad.

717
00:51:28,581 --> 00:51:31,110
This is our friend April.

718
00:51:31,335 --> 00:51:32,820
-Hi, May.
-Nice to meet you.

719
00:51:33,001 --> 00:51:36,115
-God, you're a doll. Good going.
-Thanks.

720
00:51:36,295 --> 00:51:38,414
So we're all here.
What's the big news?

721
00:51:38,591 --> 00:51:43,373
-Yeah, what's going on?
-Okay, well, as of tomorrow...

722
00:51:43,551 --> 00:51:47,158
...my brother, Walter L. Tenor,
the thespian...

723
00:51:47,348 --> 00:51:53,092
...will be co-starring in his very own
major network television series!

724
00:51:53,313 --> 00:51:56,558
-That's incredible.
-It's called Honey and the Beaze.

725
00:51:56,731 --> 00:51:59,391
Cher plays Honey,
I have the role of Mack Beasley.

726
00:51:59,569 --> 00:52:02,182
-Cher Cher?
-One of the nicest women.

727
00:52:02,401 --> 00:52:05,646
-As classy as they come.
-You must've done a great audition!

728
00:52:05,824 --> 00:52:07,768
-He didn't even have to!
-Nothing.

729
00:52:07,953 --> 00:52:12,160
We bumped into Cher on the studio lot,
and she invited us out for coffee.

730
00:52:12,330 --> 00:52:15,691
Actually, yerba mats,
which is this very soothing tea drink--

731
00:52:15,872 --> 00:52:17,486
-Six bucks, though.
-Yeah.

732
00:52:17,669 --> 00:52:22,203
She starts telling us all this personal
stuff like, she's been in a relationship...

733
00:52:22,383 --> 00:52:25,582
...for the last three years
with a very high-profile actor...

734
00:52:25,759 --> 00:52:29,040
-...but they've kept it out of the press.
-Who?

735
00:52:29,220 --> 00:52:31,586
How would we know?
That's way too personal.

736
00:52:31,767 --> 00:52:33,922
-You didn't ask her?
-No, I asked a lot.

737
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:36,877
And she said,
"That's way too personal."

738
00:52:37,103 --> 00:52:41,509
We had it going on!
And I was going:

739
00:52:44,652 --> 00:52:46,719
Mikey! I haven't seen you, man.

740
00:52:46,943 --> 00:52:53,138
To Bob, my best friend,
who I'm just getting to know.

741
00:52:53,494 --> 00:52:55,942
-Hello, May.
-Wes!

742
00:52:57,163 --> 00:53:00,408
Oh, aren't you gonna introduce me
to your best friend?

743
00:53:00,582 --> 00:53:03,989
-Hi, name's Bob Tenor.
-Yeah, I know who you are.

744
00:53:04,169 --> 00:53:08,951
-You're HoldthePickle@hotmail.com.
-I came up with that.

745
00:53:09,132 --> 00:53:11,661
-It's a double-entendre.
-I'm sorry, Bob.

746
00:53:11,842 --> 00:53:14,666
He hacked into my computer at work
and read my mail.

747
00:53:14,846 --> 00:53:16,913
Don't be pissed there,
lover boy, okay?

748
00:53:17,096 --> 00:53:19,497
I think I had a right
to check up on my girl.

749
00:53:19,684 --> 00:53:23,503
-I am not your girl!
-Not my girlfriend, huh?

750
00:53:23,688 --> 00:53:26,851
Then what was that about
up at Mulholland when you sucked--

751
00:53:27,065 --> 00:53:30,053
Hey, hey, hey!
I think we've heard enough, okay?

752
00:53:30,234 --> 00:53:31,884
Bob, let him finish.

753
00:53:32,113 --> 00:53:36,184
When you sucked down a six-pack
with me and said you cared for me.

754
00:53:36,366 --> 00:53:40,437
-You--
-I said I cared for you as a co-worker.

755
00:53:40,620 --> 00:53:44,275
You have good business sense.
That's all.

756
00:53:45,165 --> 00:53:49,372
Hey, Wes, why don't you go drown
your sorrows somewhere else, okay?

757
00:53:50,171 --> 00:53:51,622
I have a better idea.

758
00:53:51,799 --> 00:53:55,206
You and me, why don't we step outside?
Let's go. Come on.

759
00:53:55,382 --> 00:53:59,119
No, no, no, you stay out of this.
This is between him and me.

760
00:53:59,929 --> 00:54:03,701
Come on, burger boy, stand up.
What the hell's wrong with you two?

761
00:54:03,890 --> 00:54:07,545
-You can't fight fair?
-No, Bob, do not fight him.

762
00:54:07,728 --> 00:54:09,965
He's a black belt.

763
00:54:12,565 --> 00:54:16,137
Just like I thought.
You're a pussy.

764
00:54:28,373 --> 00:54:30,528
Let's not let that--

765
00:54:32,792 --> 00:54:34,277
--ruin our night.

766
00:54:34,460 --> 00:54:38,150
-Come on, let's dance.
-Oh, no, I'm a terrible dancer. I--

767
00:54:38,341 --> 00:54:40,073
Come on.

768
00:54:40,258 --> 00:54:43,830
Walt, should you be dancing
on a sprained ankle?

769
00:54:44,012 --> 00:54:48,219
Gonna take more than a sprain
to keep me off this dance floor.

770
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:55,004
You were right
about your brother Walt.

771
00:54:55,188 --> 00:54:58,595
He really doesn't give you
much rope, does he?

772
00:54:58,776 --> 00:55:01,305
She's not talking to you.

773
00:55:04,573 --> 00:55:07,057
The weather's been
just unbelievable, isn't it?

774
00:55:07,243 --> 00:55:09,808
It's just, like, incredible.

775
00:55:09,992 --> 00:55:12,605
Because I bet back home
that it's snowing still.

776
00:55:12,786 --> 00:55:15,152
Well, snow is beautiful too.

777
00:55:15,334 --> 00:55:19,106
Oh, no, no, no, snow's my favorite.
I love snow. It's awesome.

778
00:55:20,921 --> 00:55:23,827
Hey, and we don't
have earthquakes there, either.

779
00:55:24,007 --> 00:55:28,295
-Earthquakes scare me.
-Oh, me too. They, like, freak me out.

780
00:55:28,469 --> 00:55:33,003
Hey, what's with all these maniacs who
live on the cliffs, like on stilts out here?

781
00:55:33,182 --> 00:55:36,954
-These people are out of their minds.
-I couldn't do that.

782
00:55:37,143 --> 00:55:40,002
My dream house
would have to have a yard.

783
00:55:40,186 --> 00:55:45,050
No, you definitely have to have a yard.
That way, that way we could have dogs.

784
00:55:49,696 --> 00:55:52,602
I meant, me and my wife
could have dogs.

785
00:55:53,158 --> 00:55:55,102
Not you.

786
00:55:57,413 --> 00:56:00,527
Not that I have anything against you.

787
00:56:06,961 --> 00:56:10,780
Hey, May, let's go to the bathroom.

788
00:56:12,257 --> 00:56:14,037
-We'll be right back.
-See you.

789
00:56:14,218 --> 00:56:16,114
How'd my right-hand man make out?

790
00:56:26,231 --> 00:56:28,891
Look, man, I don't want any trouble.

791
00:56:29,065 --> 00:56:31,678
Holy shit!

792
00:56:31,902 --> 00:56:34,679
She's cheating on you
with a circus freak!

793
00:56:38,867 --> 00:56:43,320
Hey, Walt, Walt, Walt...
