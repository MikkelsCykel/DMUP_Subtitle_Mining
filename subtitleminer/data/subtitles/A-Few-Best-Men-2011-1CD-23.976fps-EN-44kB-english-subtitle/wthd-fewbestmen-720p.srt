1
00:00:10,385 --> 00:00:11,557
Hey.

2
00:00:14,973 --> 00:00:17,558
How do you like this? Paradise.

3
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:19,644
I never want to go home!

4
00:00:19,645 --> 00:00:22,647
David, come on!
It's going to be amazing!

5
00:00:22,648 --> 00:00:24,857
- Are you ready for your surprise?
- Yes.

6
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:28,236
OK, surprise!

7
00:00:28,237 --> 00:00:30,238
- You like it?
- <i>I</i> love him.

8
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:32,031
<i>- </i> I love you.
- Mat?

9
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:35,868
<i>- I love you.
- I love you too.</i>

10
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:38,871
The last ten days on this island
with you have...

11
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:42,875
Have been the best! I can't remember
ever feeling this happy.

12
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:45,461
So why do all good things have to end?

13
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:47,171
<i>Who says it has to end?</i>

14
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:52,053
<i>Mia, I don't know you but I think I want
to spend the rest of my life trying to.</i>

15
00:00:54,846 --> 00:00:57,473
Are you saying
what I think you're saying?

16
00:00:57,474 --> 00:00:58,896
Yes.

17
00:01:00,644 --> 00:01:03,229
Wait till you meet my family.

18
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:05,028
<i>Wait till you meet mine.</i>

that's ever happened to anyone ever.

52
00:03:27,044 --> 00:03:29,008
Sorry, mate,
we weren't supposed to know

53
00:03:29,009 --> 00:03:31,252
you'd come through the door
stark bollock naked.

54
00:03:31,253 --> 00:03:33,879
Yeah, I know. It was... thoughtful.

55
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:37,049
- Come here, good to have you back!
- You're spilling my drink.

56
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:40,261
Sorry, I've missed you, greasy hippie.

57
00:03:40,262 --> 00:03:43,347
Been stuck here for the last six months
with Luke and bloody Graham.

58
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:45,724
- You know what that's like.
<i>- </i> You alright, Graham?

59
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:47,524
<i>- </i> This has cheese on it.
- So pick it off.

60
00:03:47,525 --> 00:03:50,896
I can't just pick it off. If I have any
cheese, then I start getting malaise.

61
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:53,023
<i>- </i> Malaise.
- Yes, malaise.

62
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:54,859
Good to see nothing's changed.

63
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:57,445
- Where's Luke?
<i>- </i> He's coming later.

64
00:03:57,446 --> 00:04:00,448
Had to go around Sarah's
for the 50 millionth time this week.

65
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:02,668
- Oh, really?
<i>- </i> Oh, yeah, it's not been good.

66
00:04:02,669 --> 00:04:05,035
She's been seeing this guy called Chip.

67
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:09,248
Yeah, imagine if your girlfriend
left you for a guy called Chip.

68
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,047
Not to mention he doesn't have a penis.

69
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:14,090
What do you mean,
he doesn't have a penis?

70
00:04:14,091 --> 00:04:16,465
Apparently, it got damaged
in a boating accident.

71
00:04:16,466 --> 00:04:18,674
Anyway, how was your trip?
Tell us everything.

72
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:20,471
- Oh, OK, it was incredible.
- Yeah?

73
00:04:20,472 --> 00:04:22,892
- Did you have sex with anyone?
- Better than that.

74
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:26,766
- What? What's better than that?
- I'll tell you later.

75
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:29,852
- Whoa! Did you have a threesome?
<i>- </i> Look, the party's still going on.

76
00:04:29,853 --> 00:04:30,945
<i>- </i> Just tell us.
- No.

77
00:04:30,946 --> 00:04:33,063
David, you can't leave us
hanging like this.

78
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:34,486
I'm getting married.

79
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:38,152
Right! Everybody out!
Party's over!

80
00:04:38,153 --> 00:04:41,655
Grandad, you've had too much to drink,
you drunken old sod.

81
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:44,033
How did this happen?

82
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:46,869
How do you think it happened?
I fell in love.

83
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:49,663
Her name's Mia. She's Australian.

84
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:52,249
We met in Tuvalu,
this little island in the Paciﬁc.

85
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:56,721
And she is the most amazing,
beautiful, intelligent...

86
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:01,759
You know, the normal thing at this point
is to say congratulations.

87
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,678
Congratulations, I feel like
I've just fucking aged ten years.

88
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:07,598
Holiday flings are meant to end
at the airport, not at the altar.

89
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:09,567
Don't listen to him, David,
this is great.

90
00:05:09,568 --> 00:05:12,978
We're right behind you all the way.
Just tell us where the party is.

91
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:15,027
It's at Mia's parents‘ house
in Australia.

92
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:17,983
What, is that a fucking joke?

93
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:21,487
I can't go to Australia, it's bloody
miles away! You know I get air sickness.

94
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:24,031
Jesus, I thought you'd be
a little bit more supportive

95
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:27,368
If you don't come, it's just gonna be
me and a load of bloody Australians.

96
00:05:27,369 --> 00:05:29,167
- You're all I got.
<i>- </i> Excuse me, 20 years

97
00:05:29,168 --> 00:05:31,997
since we've been friends,
when have we ever let you down?

98
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:34,959
Uh, what about the time you told
Rachel Brookman I had syphilis?

99
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,429
Yeah, apart from that.
When you used to ride your bike

100
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:41,257
up and down Dorset Street on your own
like some kind of an infant leper,

101
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:43,226
we were the ones
who took you into our gang.

102
00:05:43,227 --> 00:05:45,469
Even though you were
this lost little orphan boy

103
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:46,813
who everyone thought was gay.

104
00:05:46,814 --> 00:05:48,889
What do you mean,
everyone thought I was gay?

105
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:51,934
They did ‘cause you were all sensitive
and nice to people and shit.

106
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:54,734
Suppose you'll be moving
to a nice two-bed in Hertfordshire?

107
00:05:56,398 --> 00:05:59,066
Oh, you're fucking joking.
You're moving to Australia?

108
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:01,661
No, it's not set yet.
We'll just... see how it goes.

109
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:06,365
<i>- </i> Hey, Luke.
- Hi, David.

110
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:08,617
- How are you?
<i>- </i> Yeah, pretty good.

111
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:11,287
I mean, I feel like I've given
the last five years of my life

112
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:15,040
in return for unimaginable pain and
torment but aside from that, I'm fine.

113
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,464
David's getting married
and moving to Australia.

114
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:27,137
Taxi!

115
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:34,560
Why does she only want you there
one day before the wedding?

116
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:37,271
- She thought it'd be romantic.
<i>- </i> You know what bugs me, bruv?

117
00:06:37,272 --> 00:06:40,107
You are about to gamble your life
on a girl you don't even know.

118
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:42,575
She's not a roulette wheel,
she's the love of my life.

119
00:06:42,576 --> 00:06:44,537
What if she turns out to be
a vagina farter?

120
00:06:44,538 --> 00:06:47,197
Your one serious relationship,
you dumped her ‘cause...

121
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:49,491
Front bottom burps, noisy flange,
disgusting.

122
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:51,288
When you lose your parents young,
Tom,

123
00:06:51,289 --> 00:06:53,584
you learn to roll the dice
when it's handed to you.

124
00:06:53,585 --> 00:06:56,790
Oh, I've taken you to Blackpool,
brother, you're a terrible gambler.

125
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:59,251
- What exactly have I got to lose?
- Us!

126
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:00,720
Aww...

127
00:07:01,713 --> 00:07:04,506
Couldn't lose you if you were a suitcase
at Terminal Five.

128
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:07,426
I'm just looking out for you,
that's all. I don't know this girl.

129
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:08,928
And neither do you.

130
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:11,221
Don't you believe
in love at first sight?

131
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:14,391
I just can't believe you're
getting married. It's just so grown-up

132
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:15,935
Every time I look at you,

133
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:18,479
I still see a little eight-year-old waif
in gym shorts.

134
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,022
That's a bit weird.

135
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:22,650
- Hi.
- Luke.

136
00:07:22,651 --> 00:07:24,485
- How are you?
- Awful.

137
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:27,029
Sarah and Chip
have officially moved in together.

138
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:28,828
<i>- </i> I'm so sorry, mate.
- Yeah.

139
00:07:28,829 --> 00:07:32,284
Well, maybe this trip will do you some
good. Maybe you'll get some distance.

140
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:34,083
- Maybe the plane will crash.
<i>- </i> Sorry.

141
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:38,040
Sorry.

142
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:39,708
Sorry I'm late.

143
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:43,087
Picking up my new business cards -
going global.

144
00:07:43,088 --> 00:07:47,059
Hitler's selling underfloor heating to
Australians. Oh, this is gonna be huge.

145
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:50,636
- Graham, what is that on your face?
- What?

146
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:52,888
That. That monstrosity.

147
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:56,058
- Oh, you mean the moustache?
- Yes, the moustache.

148
00:07:56,059 --> 00:08:00,062
I'm about to meet my future family, I
can't have you turn up looking like a...

149
00:08:00,063 --> 00:08:02,231
- Like a...
- Genocidal Fascist dictator.

150
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:05,317
What are you talking about?
Moustaches are really in at the moment.

151
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:08,195
- Not Hitler moustaches.
<i>- </i> Look, it's how my facial hair grows.

152
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:10,739
Alright? I can't help the fact
it looks like Hitler's.

153
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,783
Why are you being so negative,
anyway?

154
00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:14,409
Why can't it be a Chaplin moustache?

155
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:16,163
- Sit down, you're in the way.
- Sorry.

156
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:19,665
- Jesus!
<i>- </i> Bloody Hitler.

157
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:21,750
Ruined this moustache for everyone.

158
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:23,128
Guys...

159
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:27,464
- We're going to Australia.
- Yeah, with 14 stopovers.

160
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:30,639
Yes, stewardess! A bottle of your
cheapest champagne, please!

161
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:36,682
Toast to my friend, David Locking!

162
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:38,276
Mr David Locking!

163
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:43,027
Jorge Buentiempo!

164
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:51,039
..754 miles, 8,754 miles.

165
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:59,246
Coconut Mist.
Now available duty-free. Coconut Mist.

166
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:02,875
I thought that was never gonna end.
It was worse than a jazz concert.

167
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:04,376
Really? I slept most of the way.

168
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:07,212
That's ‘cause you weren't sitting
next to the droning clock.

169
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:09,423
I can't believe
he's doing the best man speech.

170
00:09:09,424 --> 00:09:12,134
- I've have done much better.
<i>- </i> Thought I'd give him a boost.

171
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:15,054
- Something else to focus on.
- I'd have been fuckin' hilarious.

172
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:16,972
- David Locking?
- Yes?

173
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:18,932
Come this way, please.

174
00:09:20,435 --> 00:09:22,269
- Take the bag.
- Why?

175
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:25,439
I've got something in it for David's
stag do. I don't want it searched.

176
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,818
- Absolutely not.
<i>- </i> Look at me, I'm sweaty.

177
00:09:27,819 --> 00:09:30,903
I look guilty as hell. They won't
search you, you're too confident.

178
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:32,488
True and I'm still not taking it.

179
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:35,908
- Uh, have we done something wrong?
- Not at all, Mr Locking.

180
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:39,203
I work for your father-in-law and
you're going straight to the VIP room.

181
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:41,580
Welcome to Australia.

182
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,665
VIP. Bloody damn it.

183
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:46,627
Now they're never gonna
X-ray your bag.

184
00:09:46,628 --> 00:09:48,551
<i>Welcome to VIP X-ray.</i>

185
00:09:48,552 --> 00:09:50,890
<i>Please hand your bags
to the attendant.</i>

186
00:09:55,178 --> 00:09:57,272
- Graham Vincent?
- Yes?

187
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:07,031
Shall we pop this
in your duty-free bag, sir?

188
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:12,027
- That was embarrassing.
<i>- </i> Why d'you get a gimp mask, anyway?

189
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:14,247
- Who does that?
<i>- </i> I thought it'd be a laugh.

190
00:10:14,248 --> 00:10:16,073
We're in Australia.

191
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:17,616
Who could survive here?

192
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:20,119
All that sun and beefs
gonna piss you off eventually.

193
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,620
I could learn to live with it.

194
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,831
Gonna call Sarah,
let her know we've arrived.

195
00:10:23,832 --> 00:10:26,834
Yeah, she's probably sitting
by the phone counting the minutes.

196
00:10:26,835 --> 00:10:28,335
There she is. There's Mia.

197
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:30,464
Damn signal.

198
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:35,092
Mia!

199
00:10:35,093 --> 00:10:37,016
David!

200
00:10:39,222 --> 00:10:42,474
- Oh, you alright?
<i>- </i> Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm good.

201
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,017
I'm good.

202
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:46,186
- How was the flight?
- Fine.

203
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:48,030
<i>- </i> Really long, though.
- Yeah?

204
00:10:48,031 --> 00:10:49,356
Yeah...

205
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:51,817
<i>- </i> I'll leave you to it, then.
- OK.

206
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:54,695
<i>- </i> Meet the guys. Uh, this is...
- No, no, no, don't tell me.

207
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:58,282
Um, Tom, Luke and...

208
00:10:58,283 --> 00:11:00,160
This is a Chaplin moustache
by the way.

209
00:11:00,161 --> 00:11:01,243
..Graham.

210
00:11:01,244 --> 00:11:03,245
David's pretty much told me everything.

211
00:11:03,246 --> 00:11:05,669
Well, I hope he hasn't been
slagging us off too much.

212
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:08,584
Of course not. He just called you
a pack of pricks but that was it.

213
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:11,920
- What, really?
<i>- </i> No, no! He didn't really.

214
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:14,344
Anyway, I brought the big car
so we're all gonna fit.

215
00:11:14,345 --> 00:11:16,884
- It's OK, we've organized a car rental.
- Are you sure?

216
00:11:16,885 --> 00:11:19,887
It's quite a hike and might be
the only time I get you all to myself.

217
00:11:19,888 --> 00:11:23,223
- Well, then, spend it with David.
<i>- </i> You don't know where you're going.

218
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:25,976
And God created satellites.
It's fine, Graham's driving.

219
00:11:25,977 --> 00:11:27,978
- What? No, I'm not.
- Yeah, you are.

220
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:31,899
Go, go and exchange some bodily fluids,
you know, we'll see you later.

221
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,743
Alright, cool.

222
00:11:35,987 --> 00:11:37,738
- See you later.
- See ya.

223
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:38,947
<i>Bye.</i>

224
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:41,074
<i>..this is my
chair, I paid for it.</i>

225
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:43,035
- We good?
- Yeah.

226
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:46,371
Don't hang up, don't hang up,
please! Come on. Sarah!

227
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:48,457
Luke, come on, man.

228
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:50,292
- Sarah, she's...
- Oh, shut up.

229
00:11:50,293 --> 00:11:53,045
- So, here we are.
- Yep.

230
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:55,672
We're getting married tomorrow.

231
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:56,965
Yep.

232
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:59,387
Doesn't give me much time
to get to know your parents.

233
00:11:59,388 --> 00:12:01,387
Oh, we've got all the time in the world.

234
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:05,058
God... I've waited...
three whole months...

235
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:16,035
Ooh, what have we here?

236
00:12:18,613 --> 00:12:21,036
I don't think she was that happy
to hear from me.

237
00:12:21,037 --> 00:12:23,242
What, really? What's wrong with her?

238
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:26,245
See, if I broke up with a girl,
what I'd want her to do

239
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:28,455
is ring me and hassle me constantly.

240
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:31,667
- At least I've had a girl.
<i>- </i> I've had girlfriends, Luke.

241
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:33,466
Inflatable girlfriends don't count.

242
00:12:33,467 --> 00:12:37,047
Look, I've told you a thousand times,
that was delivered to me by mistake.

243
00:12:37,048 --> 00:12:39,517
Anyway, I will phone her
and I'll keep phoning her

244
00:12:39,518 --> 00:12:41,051
until she agrees to take me back.

245
00:12:41,052 --> 00:12:43,095
- Good plan, Luke!

246
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:47,525
I can't believe
I can actually reach out and touch you.

247
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:55,732
If it wasn't for that photo,
I'd swear Tuvalu was just...

248
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:57,651
A dream?

249
00:12:57,652 --> 00:13:01,873
Yeah, sometimes I wish I'd just snap
my ﬁngers and we'd be back there.

250
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:05,334
Be careful what you wish for.

251
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:18,719
What are we doing
in the middle of the jungle, Tom?

252
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,924
Does that thing have any idea
where it's going?

253
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:22,926
Yeah, we're just on a small detour.

254
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:25,762
Found this guy, he said he could sell us
some weed for tonight.

255
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:30,726
Are you mental? I'm not taking a detour
to some skanky drug dealer's house.

256
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:32,479
We're supposed to be here for David!

257
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,229
This is for David, bell end.

258
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:37,357
For his stag night. We can't have
stag night without weed, can we?

259
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:39,484
- Can't we?
- No!

260
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:41,658
It's just down here, anyway. Turn left.

261
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,541
- Yester?
- Yester Grange.

262
00:13:51,542 --> 00:13:53,462
Oldest house
in the Blue Mountains.

263
00:13:53,463 --> 00:13:55,005
Wow.

264
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:05,057
Mum, Daph, meet David.

265
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:10,599
David, this is my adorable mum,
Barbara.

266
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,477
Welcome to the family, David.

267
00:14:18,608 --> 00:14:21,026
Um, Mum, he's British,
you're scaring him.

268
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:23,246
Oh, I'm sorry.

269
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:28,283
- Um, hi, I'm Daphne.
<i>- </i> Daph, my sister and my bestest mate.

270
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:30,452
Great to meet you.

271
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:32,251
- So where's...
- The old crock?

272
00:14:32,252 --> 00:14:37,459
My husband has been the only man
in this house for almost <i>25</i> years.

273
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:41,090
So, please, excuse his...

274
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:44,841
..enthusiasm.

275
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:47,803
<i>- Right.
- Don't worry, he won't eat you.</i>

276
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:50,055
Yeah, we fed him a big breakfast.

277
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:52,891
So, sweetheart,
ready to meet the senator?

278
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:55,441
Uh, yeah. Can't wait.

279
00:15:02,193 --> 00:15:04,736
You're not seriously getting out
of the car, are you?

280
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:07,197
- Haven't you seen Wolf Creek?
- What?

281
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:08,698
It'll be fine.

282
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:11,368
- You coming, Luke?
<i>- </i> You go, just leave me here to die.

283
00:15:11,369 --> 00:15:14,371
Luke, can you look after my bag,
please? It's got all my stuff in it.

284
00:15:14,372 --> 00:15:17,421
After I've been raped and murdered
and out into small pieces, sure.

285
00:15:19,502 --> 00:15:22,255
Wait! Wait!

286
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:28,093
Tom, can we get in and out
as quickly as possible, please?

287
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:29,346
He's a drug dealer, Graham.

288
00:15:29,347 --> 00:15:31,471
Do you think we're gonna stay
for tea and cakes?

289
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:33,598
You're the one
who brought your overnight bag.

290
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:37,269
I told the caterer, no wheat,
no dairy, no nuts,

291
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:40,439
no gluten, no seafood, no marzipan.
What's so hard about that?

292
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,566
Jim!

293
00:15:42,567 --> 00:15:45,819
- It's time.
- Well, well, well.

294
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:48,405
We meet at last.

295
00:15:48,406 --> 00:15:50,073
The hero of Tuvalu.

296
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:52,117
David, my dad, Jim Ramme.

297
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:54,703
Hmm, I was expecting
a little more beef.

298
00:15:54,704 --> 00:15:58,165
Dad... be supportive.

299
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:01,376
Yeah, I'd give him a minute
before you start busting his balls.

300
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:03,170
I see you've met Daphne.

301
00:16:03,171 --> 00:16:06,006
There we were, hoping
she'd get married as well one day.

302
00:16:06,007 --> 00:16:07,841
Turns out she's a lesbian.

303
00:16:07,842 --> 00:16:12,179
David, you must be exhausted.
Would you like to freshen up?

304
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,432
Actually, that'd be...

305
00:16:13,433 --> 00:16:16,600
He probably wants to get stuck into
the grand tour, don't you, Dave?

306
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:20,026
You know, it's been a really
long flight and everything so...

307
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:23,483
The tour would be great.

308
00:16:29,447 --> 00:16:32,991
- Hi! Are you Ray?
- No.

309
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,868
We're looking for Ray.

310
00:16:34,869 --> 00:16:37,370
Said we could come by and get some -

311
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:39,590
You know... Some weed.

312
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:43,211
Come inside.

313
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:48,340
Mad Frank send you?

314
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:51,015
No, I emailed you. Um...

315
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:55,185
I'm Tom, from the website, remember?

316
00:16:57,099 --> 00:17:01,019
- Who's the bag man?
<i>- </i> It's just my friend, Graham.

317
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:04,648
This isn't a Hitler moustache, by the
way. It's just how my facial hair grows.

318
00:17:04,649 --> 00:17:06,242
- Sit the fuck down.
- OK.

319
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:17,786
So, how much do you need?

320
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:20,586
Five, ten kilos?

321
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,173
Just an eighth if that's cool.

322
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:29,005
It's for a friend's stag night.

323
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,801
I'd prefer it if you tried it first.

324
00:17:32,802 --> 00:17:35,679
I don't want you pounding down
my door in the middle of the night

325
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,180
saying I sold you dodgy grass.

326
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:39,809
I don't think we'll be doing that.

327
00:17:40,977 --> 00:17:43,981
I said,
I'd prefer it if you tried it first.

328
00:17:53,114 --> 00:17:55,991
Tastes good, doesn't it?

329
00:17:55,992 --> 00:17:58,451
Tastes quite... Quite fruity.

330
00:17:58,452 --> 00:17:59,995
Next up, the sauna.

331
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:03,164
12-inch window with a five-star view.

332
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:05,375
That's funny.

333
00:18:05,376 --> 00:18:10,005
<i>- </i> That wasn't a joke, Dave.
- Grandad built that sauna in 1963.

334
00:18:10,006 --> 00:18:14,801
Carpenter, struggling to raise seven
children, now I own the whole property.

335
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:18,013
You can have it all, Dave, if you
don't mind getting your hands dirty.

336
00:18:18,014 --> 00:18:20,181
You see that house over there?

337
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:22,651
You play your cards right
and it's got your name on it.

338
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:27,147
- So, you guys mates?
- Yeah.

339
00:18:27,148 --> 00:18:29,107
Grew up on the same street.

340
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:33,194
I used to have mates but most of them
are in prison or dead now.

341
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:36,448
Look, I've tried making new friends,
you know, on the internet and that

342
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:38,992
but I don't know,
you can't trust anyone.

343
00:18:38,993 --> 00:18:42,162
One day they're your best mate,

344
00:18:42,163 --> 00:18:44,914
the next they're stabbing you
in the back for a gram of speed

345
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:47,042
and you wind up
having to break their kneecaps

346
00:18:47,043 --> 00:18:49,586
with a fucking ironing board,
then where are ya?

347
00:18:49,587 --> 00:18:52,181
- D'you mind if I use your toilet?
- In the meth lab.

348
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:56,181
Tom...

349
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:04,060
Hey, would you like to see
my new tattoo?

350
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:07,022
Yeah.

351
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:14,161
- Ain't she a corker?
- Yeah.

352
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:19,282
- What is it?
<i>- </i> Well, it's a little kid crying.

353
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:23,078
And those are his bastard parents
leaving him for dead.

354
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:24,829
It's original.

355
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,581
And I've saved the best for last.

356
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:30,168
Pull your socks up, Dave,
‘cause they're about to get knocked off.

357
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:33,004
This is it - Jim Ramme HQ.

358
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:36,174
It's... impressive.

359
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:39,010
This is also
where we keep Ramsy.

360
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:41,179
Uh, who's Ramsy?

361
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,223
He's the son Dad never had.

362
00:19:43,224 --> 00:19:46,017
I thought you were.

363
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:48,603
Prepare yourself, Dave,
to meet the numero uno,

364
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:51,356
the king of kings,
the champion of champions.

365
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:54,361
This is Ramsy.

366
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:57,576
Wow. A sheep.

367
00:19:59,115 --> 00:20:00,657
In the house.

368
00:20:00,658 --> 00:20:03,201
He's not just any old sheep.

369
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:05,625
The day I was photographed
with this golden fleece,

370
00:20:05,626 --> 00:20:07,580
my political career turned around.

371
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:14,587
You've met my terrifyingly efﬁcient
right-hand woman, Maureen Coate.

372
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:17,799
Mr Locking, I prepared an Excel
spreadsheet of the proceedings

373
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,926
for you and your colourful companions.

374
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:22,021
David, where are your friends?

375
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:27,016
- You got parents?
- Uh, yes.

376
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:28,810
Oh, you're lucky.

377
00:20:28,811 --> 00:20:30,311
Yeah, my parents disowned me

378
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:32,779
when I got done
for aggravated assault and battery

379
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:34,275
at Kentucky Fried Chicken.

380
00:20:34,276 --> 00:20:36,653
I still think about them.

381
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:41,156
- My parents...
<i>- </i> It's only natural.

382
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:49,748
Can I share with you
something personal?

383
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:53,168
I've started getting panic attacks.

384
00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:56,379
One minute I'll just be sitting down
real nice and calm

385
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:59,090
and the next, I don't know,
I feel like I'm gonna shit myself

386
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:00,800
or I'm gonna puke or...

387
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:02,844
I feel like I'm trapped in a sauna,
you know?

388
00:21:02,845 --> 00:21:05,439
Can't breathe, it's all sweaty,
it's fucked.

389
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:12,020
Wow. Wow. Wow.

390
00:21:12,021 --> 00:21:14,147
I don't know what it is but...

391
00:21:14,148 --> 00:21:17,152
I feel like you and I...

392
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:21,997
..you know,
we've got a really special connection.

393
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:25,784
Tom!

394
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:28,369
- Hey, you want to see something cool?
- Yeah!

395
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:30,213
Wait there.

396
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:35,919
Can we get out of here, please?
This guy's starting to freak me out.

397
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,797
So, gloves off, what do you think?

398
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:40,423
Shrewd choice, sweet pea...

399
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:44,803
handsome, sweet, diplomatically quiet.

400
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:48,807
Yeah, and you know what they say
about the quiet ones?

401
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:50,725
Tomorrow's gonna be tough.

402
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:54,145
My little girl says you can handle it
and that's good enough for me.

403
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:58,566
Half the power brokers in Australia
are going to be in that marquee.

404
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:02,362
The knives will be out and
they won't be for cutting the cake.

405
00:22:02,363 --> 00:22:03,990
But watch them fall on their swords

406
00:22:03,991 --> 00:22:08,993
when you and future senator
Mia Ramme step up to the mike.

407
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:11,788
- Mia wants to be a senator?
- She sure does.

408
00:22:11,789 --> 00:22:13,373
She just doesn't know it yet.

409
00:22:13,374 --> 00:22:16,376
Here, check this shit out.

410
00:22:16,377 --> 00:22:18,002
Just got it in from Malaysia.

411
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:20,922
This fat old woman,
she swallowed the lot

412
00:22:20,923 --> 00:22:22,632
and shat them out into a bowl.

413
00:22:22,633 --> 00:22:24,759
I got a big fucking bag of it, eh.

414
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:27,387
- Interested? <i>- </i> I don't...
It's not really my thing.

415
00:22:27,388 --> 00:22:28,930
But... Oh, is that the time?

416
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:31,140
We should probably go now, Tom,
don't you think?

417
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:34,394
Well, I was thinking maybe while
you're in town, we could go for a beer.

418
00:22:34,395 --> 00:22:36,896
- Huh?
<i>- </i> We'll go for a beer.

419
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:40,900
Well, I'd love to
but we've got lots on so...

420
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:43,279
- What have we got going on?
- We've got the wedding.

421
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,030
Yeah, but after the wedding,
we've got literally nothing.

422
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:48,783
Terrific. You give us your number
and I'll give you a call.

423
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:50,326
- My number?
<i>- </i> Yeah, yeah.

424
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:53,329
Uh, my number. Well, I can't
remember it ‘cause it's a new phone.

425
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:55,296
Here, just take
one of his business cards.

426
00:22:55,297 --> 00:22:56,713
It's got his number, his email

427
00:22:56,714 --> 00:22:59,252
and if you really have nothing to do,
there's Twitter.

428
00:22:59,253 --> 00:23:02,005
Maybe we could go out for a meal,
yeah?

429
00:23:02,006 --> 00:23:04,008
- Yeah, that would be fantastic.
- Great.

430
00:23:05,551 --> 00:23:07,519
<i>- </i> Don't worry about it.
- Thanks, man.

431
00:23:11,557 --> 00:23:14,811
- So, it's a date?
- Yeah.

432
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:22,150
Total bloody knob end.

433
00:23:22,151 --> 00:23:23,776
Why d'you give that guy my card?

434
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:25,698
I don't want to go to dinner
with that guy!

435
00:23:25,699 --> 00:23:27,915
- Don't you?
<i>- </i> Of course not! He's a psychopath!

436
00:23:27,916 --> 00:23:30,658
Let's get out of here before
he invites me on a weekend break.

437
00:23:39,335 --> 00:23:40,837
Ah!

438
00:23:43,547 --> 00:23:45,840
Jesus Christ on a bike!

439
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:49,391
Dave, your... mates are here.

440
00:23:57,478 --> 00:24:00,104
Interesting choice of facial scrub
you got there, fella.

441
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:01,648
It's just the way my hair grows.

442
00:24:01,649 --> 00:24:04,776
Well, there's only room for one dictator
in this family.

443
00:24:04,777 --> 00:24:07,997
I'm so hungry, I could eat
a sack full of baby kittens.

444
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:12,575
This is amazing, Barbara. What is it?

445
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:16,162
We have Crystal Cove prawns,
Coffin Bay oysters

446
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:19,588
and lobster mornay in a cheese sauce.

447
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:29,175
Sorry - it's cheese.

448
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:30,885
I get malaise.

449
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:33,012
So, what do you do, Luke?

450
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:36,057
I fall in love with women who then shit
on me from a great height.

451
00:24:36,058 --> 00:24:39,185
You shouldn't put them on a pedestal.

452
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:41,359
So what are the bride and groom
going to be doing

453
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,064
on their final night of freedom?

454
00:24:43,065 --> 00:24:46,985
Oh, we're gonna crank up the Abba,
turn on the sauna, get pedicures.

455
00:24:46,986 --> 00:24:49,153
Maybe do some underarm hair waxing.

456
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:52,782
- Oh, Daphne. Girls only, I'm afraid.
- Oh, that's a shame.

457
00:24:52,783 --> 00:24:54,784
What about you boys?

458
00:24:54,785 --> 00:24:57,206
I think we'll just head out,
have a quiet drink or two.

459
00:24:57,207 --> 00:24:59,079
- Just two?
<i>- </i> You're welcome to join us.

460
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:01,550
Yeah, Jim, come with us.
We're gonna get wankered.

461
00:25:01,551 --> 00:25:03,167
Not wankered.

462
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:05,762
Don't listen to what he says,
we're gonna get wankered.

463
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:09,799
I'm sorry about my friends,
that was awful.

464
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,759
Come on, they're really funny.

465
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,429
They're not meant to be funny,
they're meant to be normal.

466
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:17,181
Baby, it's a wedding, OK?
Worlds collide.

467
00:25:24,106 --> 00:25:26,024
So, this is it, isn't it?

468
00:25:26,025 --> 00:25:28,651
I'm not gonna see you
till you're walking down the aisle.

469
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:30,325
Afraid not.

470
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:34,782
Love you, Mr Locking.

471
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:41,456
- Fuck me, mate, she's loaded.
<i>- </i> Can you keep your voice down?

472
00:25:41,457 --> 00:25:43,380
Alright, David? You seem a bit stressed.

473
00:25:43,381 --> 00:25:46,085
I am stressed. I just found out
I'm about to marry a Kennedy,

474
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:47,712
you turn up acting like morons.

475
00:25:47,713 --> 00:25:50,381
- Who's acting like morons?
<i>- </i> You vomited onto your plate.

476
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:52,760
- It had cheese.
<i>- </i> Look, this wedding is important.

477
00:25:52,761 --> 00:25:55,678
More important than anything ever
so I need everyone to behave.

478
00:25:57,598 --> 00:25:59,015
OK.

479
00:25:59,016 --> 00:26:03,817
I'm not going anywhere
and you're not getting me wankered.

480
00:26:05,606 --> 00:26:08,399
I'm completely wankered,
you bastards.

481
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,486
11th hour with the lads, of course
you were gonna get wankered.

482
00:26:11,487 --> 00:26:14,530
You're not seriously going
to move out here, are you, David?

483
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:16,365
What‘ll happen to us if you go?

484
00:26:16,366 --> 00:26:20,578
I'll always be there for you,
mate, wherever I am.

485
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:23,081
We're practically brothers.

486
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:28,086
So what? If Chip doesn't have a penis,
it doesn't reflect on you.

487
00:26:28,087 --> 00:26:30,171
Who told you
Chip doesn't have a penis?

488
00:26:30,172 --> 00:26:32,006
<i>- </i> Tom did.
- Tom!

489
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:34,383
That Chip has sailed!

490
00:26:34,384 --> 00:26:35,927
This place is a nightmare.

491
00:26:35,928 --> 00:26:39,013
They don't tell you about all this shit
in the adverts, do they?

492
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:40,681
Guys, watch this.

493
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:43,017
Graham. Graham.

494
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:45,061
What the fuck is that on your neck,
man?

495
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:48,858
- Get it off me! Get it off me!

496
00:26:51,777 --> 00:26:54,195
Get off me! Get off me!

497
00:26:54,196 --> 00:26:57,156
Seriously, where is it? Where is it?
Where is it, guys?

498
00:26:57,157 --> 00:26:59,784
It's on the ground, Graham,
with all the other leaves.

499
00:26:59,785 --> 00:27:02,787
Bastards.

500
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:07,542
What the fuck do we have here?

501
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:12,055
Look at the size
of his man boobs.

502
00:27:15,134 --> 00:27:17,009
This isn't just any sheep, Graham.

503
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:19,387
This is Ramsy.

504
00:27:19,388 --> 00:27:21,140
The ram behind the man.

505
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:29,355
- David, get in there.
- No, no, I will not...

506
00:27:35,529 --> 00:27:39,615
Six hours and 59 minutes till lift-off.
Go, go, go, people!

507
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:41,289

508
00:27:46,373 --> 00:27:48,166
It's not too late to elope.

509
00:27:48,167 --> 00:27:52,003
Oh, yeah, Dad would be cool
if I went and eloped.

510
00:27:52,004 --> 00:27:55,590
Yeah, leave it to me to do
all the bad-ass stuff in this family.

511
00:27:55,591 --> 00:27:59,594
Like smoking, failing uni,
eating cheesecake.

512
00:27:59,595 --> 00:28:03,389
And pretending to be a lesbian
just to piss Dad off.

513
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:06,601
Daph, is it normal to feel this nervous?

514
00:28:06,602 --> 00:28:10,563
Yeah, you could be about to make
the biggest mistake of your life.

Um, just checking
if you needed any clean... towels.

No, I think we're OK for towels.
Graham?

Yeah.

552
00:30:47,054 --> 00:30:49,221

Why are you wearing a gimp mask?

561
00:31:18,794 --> 00:31:22,004
Ah! He put it on me while I was asleep.

562
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:24,090
I don't know why
you thought that'd be funny.

563
00:31:24,091 --> 00:31:26,801
- Yeah, must be insane, it's not funny.
- Stop it!

564
00:31:26,802 --> 00:31:30,054
The bigger question is
what is Ramsy doing in my room?

565
00:31:30,055 --> 00:31:31,932
- Who?
- The sheep!

It's in my room

569

- Oh, yeah, I did, didn't I?

570
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:46,612
I thought it'd be quite funny
at the time.

571
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:49,490
You need to get him back

What is Eddie Marshall doing
at the bridal table?

914
00:50:06,212 --> 00:50:08,379
That's odd, there must be
some sort of mistake.

915
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:12,260
Maureen doesn't make mistakes.
Last chance to come clean, dear.

916
00:50:13,594 --> 00:50:16,638
You know how you're always going on
about me never being home?

917
00:50:16,639 --> 00:50:21,059
- When do I go on about it?
- Well, I'm retiring.

918
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:23,228
That's right,
I'm going to throw in the towel.

919
00:50:23,229 --> 00:50:25,813
And with Eddie's blessing,
I'm gonna give my seat to Mia.

920
00:50:25,814 --> 00:50:27,566
Is that what Mia wants?

921
00:50:28,817 --> 00:50:31,486
- Have you even asked her?
- I don't have to.

922
00:50:31,487 --> 00:50:33,114
<i>- </i> Yes, you do.
- No, I don't.

923
00:50:33,115 --> 00:50:35,281
It's a surprise <i>-</i>
my wedding present.

924
00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:37,501
It's not your wedding, Jim!

925
00:50:41,956 --> 00:50:43,833
Such a lovely day to be here today.

926
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:49,087
It's such a lovely day to be here...
Oh, Christ! I'm getting the jitters.

927
00:50:49,088 --> 00:50:50,965
Don't think
I can go through with this.

928
00:50:50,966 --> 00:50:52,512
Yeah, thought this might happen.

929
00:50:54,593 --> 00:50:57,303
- Is that Ray's coke?
<i>- </i> It's just one, he'll never notice.

930
00:50:57,304 --> 00:51:00,223
Are you off your nut?!
We've got to give it all back!

931
00:51:00,224 --> 00:51:03,059
I've got to do a speech!
I can't do drugs!

932
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:06,729
What shit are you talking, Graham?
This will give you a bit of confidence.

933
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:08,607
- Really?
<i>- </i> Absolutely. Come on.

934
00:51:18,993 --> 00:51:20,493
Isn't that a bit much?

935
00:51:20,494 --> 00:51:22,963
You need to do a lot
otherwise it won't have an impact.

936
00:51:22,964 --> 00:51:24,628
Come on, before someone comes.

937
00:51:28,377 --> 00:51:31,671
- Good afternoon, Barbara.
<i>- </i> What in the hell is going on?

938
00:51:31,672 --> 00:51:34,841
<i>Uh, we just... We, um...</i>

939
00:51:34,842 --> 00:51:36,389
Is that cocaine?

940
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:39,554
Yeah.

941
00:51:39,555 --> 00:51:43,480
Well, don't just stand there gawping.
Line ‘em up!

942
00:51:50,357 --> 00:51:54,193
You could desalinate your soil by
replacing wheat with mallee scrub

943
00:51:54,194 --> 00:51:57,864
and that'll earn you big CER bucks
into the UN trade subsidy.

944
00:51:57,865 --> 00:51:59,574
Excuse me.

945
00:51:59,575 --> 00:52:03,202
- David.
- Wow. That sounded impressive.

946
00:52:03,203 --> 00:52:05,747
Four years of political science
will do that to you.

947
00:52:05,748 --> 00:52:09,834
- I thought you did sociology.
<i>- </i> No, majored in Conflict Resolution.

948
00:52:09,835 --> 00:52:11,878
Very useful in my family.

949
00:52:11,879 --> 00:52:14,631
And your psychology degree
is going to come in handy.

950
00:52:14,632 --> 00:52:16,841
<i>- </i> Physics.
- What?

951
00:52:16,842 --> 00:52:20,847
- I did physics.
<i>- </i> Oh. Of course you did.

952
00:52:23,807 --> 00:52:26,434
Oh, I knew he wasn't going
to let go easily

953
00:52:26,435 --> 00:52:29,228
but this one really takes the biscuit.

954
00:52:29,229 --> 00:52:32,106
Gotta say, didn't have you pegged
as a party girl, Barbara.

955
00:52:32,107 --> 00:52:34,025
Oh, last couple on the dance floor

956
00:52:34,026 --> 00:52:36,402
until Jim became
this right-wing maniac.

957
00:52:36,403 --> 00:52:38,446
Now look at him - retiring!

958
00:52:38,447 --> 00:52:41,032
Giving up his seat for his daughter.

959
00:52:41,033 --> 00:52:43,201
Try forcing it down her throat

960
00:52:43,202 --> 00:52:45,703
You can mess with me -
that's one thing...

961
00:52:45,704 --> 00:52:47,246
but mess with my kids?

962
00:52:47,247 --> 00:52:49,040
No way, Jose, that's it!

963
00:52:49,041 --> 00:52:50,833
End of the road!

964
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:53,961
- Your turn, Graham.
<i>- </i> I'm alright, thanks.

965
00:52:53,962 --> 00:52:56,214
Don't be such a wuss.

966
00:52:56,215 --> 00:52:58,843
Meow! Meow!
Don't be such a pussy, come on.

967
00:53:00,803 --> 00:53:03,304
- Pussy.

968
00:53:03,305 --> 00:53:06,057
♪ Howzat? ♪

969
00:53:06,058 --> 00:53:07,767
Eddie's going cold.

970
00:53:07,768 --> 00:53:10,728
Christ! Now what do we do?
Barbara's gone AWOL.

971
00:53:10,729 --> 00:53:14,404
Right! Now I'm really
going to enjoy myself.

972
00:53:24,785 --> 00:53:28,037
It'd be quite bad, wouldn't it,
to try and shag David's mother-in-law?

973
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:31,207
Of course it bloody would.
Shit, that coke‘s strong!

974
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:33,209
- Completely fucked.
- I know.

975
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:36,629
- I'm really wired.
- You told me to have loads.

976
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:39,850
I think I may have been a bit gung-ho.

977
00:53:45,013 --> 00:53:49,439
So, Eddie,
has your third wife left you yet?

978
00:53:51,228 --> 00:53:53,813
Ladies and gentlemen,
would you please take your seats?

979
00:53:53,814 --> 00:53:55,606
I can't feel my face.

980
00:53:55,607 --> 00:53:59,485
..best man's toast to be delivered
by... Graham.

981
00:53:59,486 --> 00:54:01,487
<i>- What?</i>

982
00:54:01,488 --> 00:54:03,490
Fuck! I'm not ready, Tom.

983
00:54:07,661 --> 00:54:10,246
Have you got the speech?

984
00:54:10,247 --> 00:54:11,749
Thanks.

985
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:31,267
Tits?

986
00:54:31,268 --> 00:54:32,861
Tits.

987
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:35,897
Tits...

988
00:54:35,898 --> 00:54:38,024
'Tis a wonderful occasion.

989
00:54:38,025 --> 00:54:43,404
Uh, I must admit I was a bit worried
about coming to Australia at first.

990
00:54:43,405 --> 00:54:46,454
It being the country we sent
all our criminals to and everything.

991
00:54:48,076 --> 00:54:52,497
But Australia is no longer
just a penal colony

992
00:54:52,498 --> 00:54:54,916
for England's rapists and murderers.

993
00:54:54,917 --> 00:54:58,419
No, it's now a country in its own right.

994
00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:02,673
Or at least it was since you lot
stole all the land off the Aborigines.

995
00:55:09,097 --> 00:55:12,850
Uh, I think I can speak
on behalf of all of us

996
00:55:12,851 --> 00:55:18,397
when I say that I'm very pleased to hear
that David's now married

997
00:55:18,398 --> 00:55:22,448
especially since at first
we all thought he was a homosexual.

998
00:55:23,904 --> 00:55:25,404
Homosexual.

999
00:55:27,783 --> 00:55:31,285
But hopefully, Mia, you haven't
just married one of those gays

1000
00:55:31,286 --> 00:55:32,787
that's in denial for years

1001
00:55:32,788 --> 00:55:35,832
and then you come home and
find him in bed shagging another man.

1002
00:55:35,833 --> 00:55:41,087
Uh, but don't worry, Mia,
there are signs to look out for,

1003
00:55:41,088 --> 00:55:44,173
like anal sex.

1004
00:55:46,593 --> 00:55:49,011
Apparently,
if he's excessively into anal sex,

1005
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:53,233
then that's a sign,
so look out for that one.

1006
00:55:57,062 --> 00:56:00,857
Um, I mean, it's fair enough
if it's just occasional, you know

1007
00:56:00,858 --> 00:56:02,576
I mean, I'm sure that you've tried it.

1008
00:56:02,577 --> 00:56:06,445
Most couples try it, don't they,
at some point?

1009
00:56:06,446 --> 00:56:10,449
Uh, just... If you haven't tried it
and you are gonna try it this evening,

1010
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:13,160
then just go easy on each other,
don't whack it up dry,

1011
00:56:13,161 --> 00:56:15,371
use some butter from the table
or something...

1012
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:17,290
Thank you, Graham.

1013
00:56:17,291 --> 00:56:21,335
Ladies and gentlemen,
the bride and groom.

1014
00:56:23,005 --> 00:56:24,598
Maestro!

1015
00:56:26,425 --> 00:56:29,343
<i>- </i> Well, that was... That was...
- Awful?

1016
00:56:29,344 --> 00:56:33,264
Atrocious? Humiliating?
What the hell was he thinking?

1017
00:56:33,265 --> 00:56:35,313
I don't know, David, he's your friend.

1018
00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:39,478
David, are you a homosexual?

1019
00:56:39,479 --> 00:56:41,230
No, of course not.

1020
00:56:41,231 --> 00:56:43,029
Because if you're doing this for a visa,

1021
00:56:43,030 --> 00:56:45,318
the Minister for Immigration
is sitting there!

1022
00:56:45,319 --> 00:56:47,778
I'm not gay, it was a joke.

1023
00:56:47,779 --> 00:56:50,072
We'd better start laughing, then,
hadn't we, eh?

1024
00:56:53,869 --> 00:56:56,495
Fantastic! What I really loved
is you gave everyone here

1025
00:56:56,496 --> 00:56:58,497
an image of David doing Mia
up the arse.

1026
00:56:58,498 --> 00:57:00,666
You gave me the wrong piece of paper,
you moron.

1027
00:57:00,667 --> 00:57:02,340
I was left with your picture of tits.

1028
00:57:02,341 --> 00:57:04,714
- Shit, mate, is that what happened?
- Yes.

1029
00:57:06,798 --> 00:57:09,091
David, I'm so sorry.

1030
00:57:09,092 --> 00:57:11,844
I had the whole speech worked out
but when I got the paper out,

1031
00:57:11,845 --> 00:57:14,847
it was just this picture of tits
and it just totally threw me.

1032
00:57:14,848 --> 00:57:16,849
You need to apologise to Jim.

1033
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:19,644
- Do I have to?
- Yes!

1034
00:57:19,645 --> 00:57:21,739
I think he's about to go
into cardiac arrest.

1035
00:57:27,778 --> 00:57:29,826
I haven't been to a wedding
in years.

1036
00:57:31,198 --> 00:57:34,033
Fucking little dead shit.

1037
00:57:34,034 --> 00:57:36,077
I thought we had a connection.

1038
00:57:36,078 --> 00:57:39,622
I even told him about my panic attacks.

1039
00:57:39,623 --> 00:57:43,167
- I'm gonna barge in there...
<i>- </i> You can't barge in dressed like that.

1040
00:57:43,168 --> 00:57:45,836
Oh, I can barge wherever I fucking like.

1041
00:57:45,837 --> 00:57:48,839
You want to go in there
and mess this guy up?

1042
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:50,841
You want everyone to recognise you?

1043
00:57:50,842 --> 00:57:55,018
You got to blend in, dress nice.
It's a wedding.

1044
00:58:04,773 --> 00:58:08,234
Barbara, could I have a word?

1045
00:58:08,235 --> 00:58:11,455
Too many words, Jim,
not enough champagne.

1046
00:58:13,198 --> 00:58:15,241
Come on!

1047
00:58:15,242 --> 00:58:17,836
Weddings. Women.

1048
00:58:19,037 --> 00:58:21,831
- Crazy.
- Yes.

1049
00:58:21,832 --> 00:58:25,835
Still, my girl's working the room
like a pro.

1050
00:58:25,836 --> 00:58:28,504
You honestly think she's ready?

1051
00:58:28,505 --> 00:58:32,633
There comes a moment in time
when the universe cries out...

1052
00:58:32,634 --> 00:58:36,846
Jim, I just want to apologise
for before.

1053
00:58:36,847 --> 00:58:39,432
You see, what I thought
was actually my speech

1054
00:58:39,433 --> 00:58:42,268
actually turned out to be
this drawing of...

1055
00:58:42,269 --> 00:58:44,812
Well, you can see what it is.

1056
00:58:44,813 --> 00:58:46,605
It's tits.

1057
00:58:46,606 --> 00:58:49,108
Anyway, I'm really sorry.

1058
00:58:49,109 --> 00:58:52,028
Sorry? Hah! Come on!

1059
00:58:52,029 --> 00:58:54,780
You'll have your own chat show
with a performance like that.

1060
00:58:54,781 --> 00:58:56,240
You were a riot!

1061
00:58:56,241 --> 00:59:00,462
It was really, really, really funny.

1062
00:59:02,247 --> 00:59:04,466
You pull your head in, kid.

1063
00:59:10,797 --> 00:59:13,841
- Jim.
<i>- </i> This is going pear-shaped.

1064
00:59:13,842 --> 00:59:16,052

It's too late, I'm afraid, Tom!

Excuse me, I said my tie is...

Great! Except my husband
keeps going missing.

1207
01:06:58,056 --> 01:07:00,641
Oh, married life -
get used to it, darling.

1208

01:07:28,419 --> 01:07:33,048
Uh, Luke, what's that you're holding?

1216
01:07:33,049 --> 01:07:35,425
I don't think I can go on, David.

1217
01:07:35,426 --> 01:07:38,262
Are you fucking kidding?
Are you fucking kidding me?!

1218
01:07:38,263 --> 01:07:39,805
Sorry.

1219
01:07:39,806 --> 01:07:41,848
I don't have a choice.

1220
01:07:41,849 --> 01:07:44,434
Just... Hold on a second, Luke.

1221
01:07:44,435 --> 01:07:46,938
And think about what you're doing.

1222
01:07:48,565 --> 01:07:51,569
All I can think about is her
all the time.

1223
01:07:52,610 --> 01:07:54,829
Her and that dick-less wonder.

1224
01:07:58,783 --> 01:08:00,535
Do you guys have any idea what it's like

1225
01:08:00,536 --> 01:08:03,880
to think about your ex-girlfriend
having sex with a man without a penis?

1226
01:08:05,999 --> 01:08:09,048
Well, you don't know for sure
that he doesn't have one.

1227
01:08:10,420 --> 01:08:12,343
You said so yourself.
It's just a rumour.

1228
01:08:12,344 --> 01:08:14,923
To be fair, I did hear it
from a pretty reliable source.

1229
01:08:14,924 --> 01:08:16,675
Shut up, Tom.

1230
01:08:16,676 --> 01:08:21,638
Listen... Luke, d'you honestly think
that Sarah's gonna take you back

1231
01:08:21,639 --> 01:08:23,562
if you've shot yourself in the head?

1232
01:08:23,563 --> 01:08:25,856
- He's got a point, Luke.
- Come on, mate.

1233
01:08:27,604 --> 01:08:29,197
Give me the gun.

1234
01:08:31,190 --> 01:08:32,692
No.

1235
01:08:33,943 --> 01:08:35,536
Ah! Ah!

1236
01:08:36,654 --> 01:08:39,239
Stop! Stop! Aah!

1237
01:08:40,783 --> 01:08:41,950
Aah!

1238
01:08:41,951 --> 01:08:44,453
Your father just got the catering bill.

1239
01:08:44,454 --> 01:08:46,297
Back in a minute. Watch her.

1240
01:08:48,791 --> 01:08:52,419
Jesus, Luke! You could have killed
one of us, you bloody maniac!

1241
01:08:52,420 --> 01:08:55,297
Alright, calm down.
Everybody, just take a deep breath.

1242
01:08:55,298 --> 01:08:57,841
Oh, my God! I've been shot!

1243
01:08:57,842 --> 01:09:00,010
- What?
<i>- </i> Look at my arm!

1244
01:09:00,011 --> 01:09:03,764
- You shot me, Luke! You idiot!
<i>- </i> Sorry.

1245
01:09:03,765 --> 01:09:06,058
- Sorry?!
<i>- </i> Alright, Jesus, Graham.

1246
01:09:06,059 --> 01:09:08,226
It's only a flesh wound,
can we stop moaning?

1247
01:09:08,227 --> 01:09:09,728
I'm not moaning!

1248
01:09:09,729 --> 01:09:11,813
It's always something with you,
isn't it?

1249
01:09:11,814 --> 01:09:14,024
If it's not the malaise,
it's the air sickness.

1250
01:09:14,025 --> 01:09:16,777
If not the air sickness,
it's something else! I'm sick of it!

1251
01:09:16,778 --> 01:09:18,200
<i>- </i> I've been shot, Tom!
- Fine.

1252
01:09:18,201 --> 01:09:21,573
OK, let's all acknowledge the fact
that Graham's been shot, OK?

1253
01:09:21,574 --> 01:09:24,409
- There! You happy now?
- Not really.

1254
01:09:28,414 --> 01:09:30,041
- Shit.
<i>- </i> Oh, my God.

1257
01:09:41,427 --> 01:09:44,513
There's no wound. It must have gone
into shock. What do we do?

1258
01:09:44,514 --> 01:09:46,437
Maybe we should give it
mouth-to-mouth.

1259
01:09:46,438 --> 01:09:47,974
- Good idea.
- Graham.

1260
01:09:47,975 --> 01:09:49,773
- Yes?
<i>- </i> You know CPR, don't you?

1261
01:09:49,774 --> 01:09:51,520
Not on barnyard animals.

01:09:51,521 --> 01:09:54,272
Oh, come on, it's the same shit.
Just breathe into his mouth.

1263

<i>- You do it!
- You've had your hand up his arse.</i>

1264
01:09:56,368 --> 01:09:58,402
What difference if you breathe
in his mouth?

1265
01:09:58,403 --> 01:10:00,622
How do I even do it?
His mouth is the wrong shape!

1266
01:10:00,623 --> 01:10:02,364
I can't even get any suction!

1267
01:10:02,365 --> 01:10:06,368

01:10:45,992 --> 01:10:48,410
- Mia, stop!
- What the hell was that, David?

1277
01:10:48,411 --> 01:10:53,248
I mean, yeah, I've got a sense of humour
but who are you people?

1278
01:10:53,249 --> 01:10:55,292
OK, OK, take a deep breath.

1279
01:10:55,293 --> 01:10:57,836
Remember the beach, you and me,
Tuvalu.

1280
01:10:57,837 --> 01:11:00,338
Tuvalu suddenly seems like
a very long way away!

1281
01:11:00,339 --> 01:11:01,841
Mia, stop!

1282
01:11:04,010 --> 01:11:06,052
Have I just made a terrible mistake?

1283
01:11:06,053 --> 01:11:08,096
Have we just made
a terrible mistake here?

1284
01:11:08,097 --> 01:11:10,140
Do we really know each other?

1285
01:11:10,141 --> 01:11:14,436
I mean, maybe what we have
is just a holiday romance.

1286
01:11:14,437 --> 01:11:17,397
Don't say that. This is just
a really unfortunate situation.

1287
01:11:17,398 --> 01:11:19,024
I'll sort it out, I promise!

1288
01:11:19,025 --> 01:11:22,652
You keep saying that but it just seems
to get worse and worse and worse.

1289
01:11:22,653 --> 01:11:24,821
It hasn't been that easy for me,
you know.

1290
01:11:24,822 --> 01:11:27,240
I'm doing my best.

1291
01:11:27,241 --> 01:11:29,409
And now I find out
you're gonna be a senator.

1292
01:11:29,410 --> 01:11:33,256
I'm not going to be a senator.
I don't want to be a senator.

1293
01:11:34,415 --> 01:11:37,250
Wha... Uh...

1294
01:11:37,251 --> 01:11:41,421
David, look,
all I want is to be with you.

1295
01:11:41,422 --> 01:11:45,842
So I'm begging you,
whatever weird shit is going on here,

1296
01:11:45,843 --> 01:11:48,929
just sort it out.

1297
01:11:48,930 --> 01:11:50,182
Please.

1298
01:12:00,191 --> 01:12:02,234
You alright, bro?

1299
01:12:02,235 --> 01:12:04,402
God, that was all a bit awkward,
wasn't it?

1300
01:12:04,403 --> 01:12:06,451
I thought you were supposed to be
my friend.

1301
01:12:08,783 --> 01:12:10,826
Wait, of course I'm your friend.

1302
01:12:10,827 --> 01:12:15,372
- What are you talking about?
<i>- </i> The drugs. The sheep. The speech.

1303
01:12:15,373 --> 01:12:17,467
Are you purposely trying
to screw up my life?

1304
01:12:19,418 --> 01:12:21,887
- Why would I wanna do that, David?
- I don't know, Tom!

1305
01:12:21,888 --> 01:12:25,590
Maybe because you're jealous?
Selfish? Immature?

1306
01:12:25,591 --> 01:12:28,260
Hang on a minute! Yeah, I'm immature!

1307
01:12:28,261 --> 01:12:30,345
Who's the one marrying a girl
he barely knows

1308
01:12:30,346 --> 01:12:33,223
and leaving his friends behind
like they don't count for shit?

1309
01:12:33,224 --> 01:12:34,851
How bloody immature is that, David?

1310
01:12:36,602 --> 01:12:39,396
OK, so I didn't entirely know
I felt like that until just now.

1311
01:12:39,397 --> 01:12:41,398
But it's true, innit?

1312
01:12:41,399 --> 01:12:44,234
You're dumping us.

1313
01:12:44,235 --> 01:12:48,029
You're moving on and you're destroying
my youth in the process.

1314
01:12:48,030 --> 01:12:52,409
Right, so what you're saying is that
you don't support me getting married.

1315
01:12:52,410 --> 01:12:54,411
That's right, I don't.

1316
01:12:54,412 --> 01:12:57,414
I think you met a girl on a beach
holiday, I think you don't know her

1317
01:12:57,415 --> 01:12:59,583
and I think you didn't even consult me,
David!

1318
01:12:59,584 --> 01:13:01,211
- Consult you?!
- Yes, consult me!

1319
01:13:01,212 --> 01:13:04,588
I'm sorry if my getting married
makes you feel old but I love this girl!

1320
01:13:04,589 --> 01:13:08,091
- This is my chance to have a family.
- Thought we were your family.

1321
01:13:08,092 --> 01:13:11,845
Yeah, but you're not my family, Tom.
You're my mates.

1322
01:13:11,846 --> 01:13:15,851
And however much you call me
brother‘ or 'bro' won't change that

1323
01:13:29,989 --> 01:13:31,741
Hello, Graham.

1324
01:13:36,412 --> 01:13:39,831
There you are, David!
The dance floor is hotting up!

1325
01:13:39,832 --> 01:13:42,042
- Hi, Barbara.
<i>- </i> It's going off!

1326
01:13:42,043 --> 01:13:44,135
- I've just got to...
<i>- </i> No, not got to nothing.

1327
01:13:44,136 --> 01:13:45,880
You're not a real member of this family

1328
01:13:45,881 --> 01:13:49,132
until you have macarenaed
with your mother-in-law.

1329
01:13:49,133 --> 01:13:52,603
- Where are my drugs?
<i>- </i> There. They're all there.

1330
01:13:56,432 --> 01:13:59,059
Why do my drugs smell like shit?

1331
01:13:59,060 --> 01:14:01,233
Uh, we... We, um...

1332
01:14:02,188 --> 01:14:04,397
Had to, oh...

1333
01:14:04,398 --> 01:14:06,275
You let me down, Graham.

1334
01:14:08,778 --> 01:14:11,237
- I thought we were friends.
- We are friends.

1335
01:14:11,238 --> 01:14:13,616
- I thought you liked me.
<i>- </i> I do like you.

1336
01:14:13,617 --> 01:14:15,459
Is that... Is that my suit?

1337
01:14:17,536 --> 01:14:22,415
I shared with you and what do you do?
You spit it back in my face.

1338
01:14:22,416 --> 01:14:25,251
The whole thing was just
a big misunderstanding.

1339
01:14:25,252 --> 01:14:28,254
I never would have taken your bag
on purpose.

1340
01:14:28,255 --> 01:14:30,632
Look, we're mates, aren't we?

1341
01:14:30,633 --> 01:14:32,676
We're going out for dinner next week.

1342
01:14:32,677 --> 01:14:34,719
<i>Hmm?</i>

1343
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:37,639
Maybe... Maybe a drink afterwards?

1344
01:14:37,640 --> 01:14:40,689
OK, sure. We'll have a good time.

1345
01:14:45,398 --> 01:14:47,617
- What happened to your arm?
<i>- </i> It's nothing.

1346
01:14:47,618 --> 01:14:50,652
I just got kind of shot,
it's just a flesh wound.

1347
01:14:50,653 --> 01:14:52,696
You're gonna need
to get that cleaned up.

1348
01:14:52,697 --> 01:14:57,033
- Well, I think... <i>- </i> No.
You need to get that cleaned up.

1349
01:14:57,034 --> 01:14:59,077
- OK.
- Good.

1350
01:14:59,078 --> 01:15:01,579
Take your pants off.

1351
01:15:04,417 --> 01:15:07,836
Ah! Hey! Yay!

1352
01:15:07,837 --> 01:15:11,256
- Thanks, that was great.
<i>- </i> Where do you think you're going?

1353
01:15:11,257 --> 01:15:14,175
They haven't played YMCA yet. Yoohoo!

1354
01:15:19,015 --> 01:15:22,394
I was thinking I could maybe let you off
for taking the drugs.

1355
01:15:26,814 --> 01:15:30,614
- It was an accident, wasn't it?
<i>- </i> Absolutely, Ray.

1356
01:15:32,361 --> 01:15:34,029
Oh!

1357
01:15:34,030 --> 01:15:36,281
- No!
- Yes.

1358
01:15:36,282 --> 01:15:39,617
- What are you doing, you idiot?
<i>- </i> Saving your arse, that's what.

1359
01:15:39,618 --> 01:15:43,204
I completely talked him around!
He was gonna let us off the drugs!

1360
01:15:43,205 --> 01:15:46,249
How am I supposed to know that?
You're lying there bare-chested!

1361
01:15:46,250 --> 01:15:48,877
- I don't know what's going on!
<i>- </i> What are we gonna do, Tom?

1362
01:15:48,878 --> 01:15:50,920

01:25:36,381 --> 01:25:38,633
Sweetheart.

1518
01:25:38,634 --> 01:25:40,676
I know you're upset.

1519
01:25:40,677 --> 01:25:43,596
But it hasn't been a total washout.

1520
01:25:43,597 --> 01:25:45,850
It was going to be a wedding present...

1521
01:25:47,559 --> 01:25:49,644
Jim, this is not the time.

1522
01:25:49,645 --> 01:25:53,064
Congratulations, Senator.

1523
01:25:53,065 --> 01:25:55,399
- Wha...
<i>- </i> I'm retiring, sweetheart.

1524
01:25:55,400 --> 01:25:58,027
And I'm giving my seat to you.

1525
01:25:58,028 --> 01:26:00,030
Bigger one.

1526
01:26:01,365 --> 01:26:04,158
The party's all behind it
and if Eddie Marshall gives the OK,

1527
01:26:04,159 --> 01:26:06,202
you'll be running on your own
next election.

1528
01:26:06,203 --> 01:26:07,244
How could you?

1529
01:26:07,245 --> 01:26:09,955
- Big one.
- Bigger one.

1530
01:26:09,956 --> 01:26:12,041
Oh!

1531
01:26:12,042 --> 01:26:13,840
Mia?

1532
01:26:16,171 --> 01:26:17,923
Mia?

1533
01:26:19,758 --> 01:26:22,051
I'm so sorry for what happened today.

1534
01:26:22,052 --> 01:26:24,095
More than you can imagine.

1535
01:26:24,096 --> 01:26:27,306
But I'm not sorry I met you,
I'm not sorry I love you,

1536
01:26:27,307 --> 01:26:28,891
I'm not sorry I married you.

1537
01:26:28,892 --> 01:26:31,644
What is it about ‘it's over‘
you don't understand, Dave?

1538
01:26:31,645 --> 01:26:35,606
My name's David, not Dave
and I'm talking to Mia so shut up!

1539
01:26:35,607 --> 01:26:37,233
Leave him, Jim.

1540
01:26:37,234 --> 01:26:39,953
Please, Mia.

1541
01:26:44,991 --> 01:26:46,664
Just press play?

1542
01:26:50,580 --> 01:26:52,456
Mia, give me the phone.

1543
01:26:52,457 --> 01:26:54,959
- Jim, for God's sake, shut up!
- Shut up!

1544
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:57,463
They told me nobody was here.

1545
01:26:59,172 --> 01:27:01,632
And I guess that's why I came.

1546
01:27:01,633 --> 01:27:05,052
I was lost and I needed time
to figure it out

1547
01:27:05,053 --> 01:27:07,852
and suddenly, there you were.

1548
01:27:09,182 --> 01:27:11,310
On the same beach
looking for the same thing.

1549
01:27:12,394 --> 01:27:14,770
This little beach
is where my life began.

1550
01:27:14,771 --> 01:27:17,024
My parents left me a trust.

1551
01:27:18,150 --> 01:27:20,198
Just enough to put down a deposit.

1552
01:27:22,362 --> 01:27:24,405
It's ours, Mia.

1553
01:27:24,406 --> 01:27:27,366
It's not England or Australia.

1554
01:27:27,367 --> 01:27:28,826
Ours.

1555
01:27:28,827 --> 01:27:31,203
I know we've only just met

1556
01:27:31,204 --> 01:27:34,039
but I know that we belong together.

1557
01:27:34,040 --> 01:27:35,633
I love you.

1558
01:27:37,586 --> 01:27:41,636
So, let's start here and
figure out the next part together.

1559
01:27:43,383 --> 01:27:45,009
That's it.

1560
01:27:45,010 --> 01:27:47,636
Everything I've got and it's yours.

1561
01:27:47,637 --> 01:27:49,847
I could buy you a better beach
in Noosa!

1562
01:27:49,848 --> 01:27:51,724
Dad, stop.

1563
01:27:51,725 --> 01:27:53,559
But he's just a backpacker!

1564
01:27:53,560 --> 01:27:55,853
You were a hitchhiker when I met you!

1565
01:27:55,854 --> 01:27:59,607
It's not about the beach... or luck.

1566
01:27:59,608 --> 01:28:02,067
It's destiny and I love him.

1567
01:28:02,068 --> 01:28:03,903
Run, Mia, run!

1568
01:28:03,904 --> 01:28:05,998
Jim, let go.

1569
01:28:25,133 --> 01:28:27,181
