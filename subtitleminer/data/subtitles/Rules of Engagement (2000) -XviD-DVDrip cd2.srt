I was late because

So why did I take
this job?

00:18:00,068 --> 00:18:03,401
I took this case because
Terry Childers told me...

00:18:03,471 --> 00:18:07,737
I would have done the same thing
he did if I'd been in his shoes.

182
00:18:07,809 --> 00:18:11,176
I took the case because I know Terry
Childers. His word is his bond.

326
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:35,756
Captain, what were the words
Colonel Childers used...

327
00:25:35,823 --> 00:25:38,155
when he ordered you to fire
on the demonstrators?

328

I don't remember
the exact words, sir.

329

<i>He ordered me</i>
<i>to open fire.</i>

330
00:25:45,499 --> 00:25:47,467
When you obeyed Colonel
Childers' order to open fire,

331
00:25:47,535 --> 00:25:49,469
did you believe it
to be a lawful order?

332
00:25:49,537 --> 00:25:50,561
Yes, sir.

333
00:25:50,671 --> 00:25:53,640
Otherwise it would have been your
duty to disobey. Is that right?

334
00:25:53,708 --> 00:25:54,800
Yes, sir.

335
00:25:54,875 --> 00:25:57,343
When your men opened fire
on the attackers in the crowd,

336
00:25:57,411 --> 00:26:01,177
did the snipers in the buildings
across the way cease their firing?

337
00:26:01,249 --> 00:26:03,217
Absolutely, sir.
It went completely quiet.

338
00:26:03,284 --> 00:26:04,410
It would seem, then,

339
00:26:04,485 --> 00:26:05,952
that the two groups were
actually one working together.

00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:13,421
when everyone was evacuated?

344
00:26:13,494 --> 00:26:14,426
Yes, I was.

345
00:26:14,495 --> 00:26:16,486
What was the last thing
you saw him do?

346
00:26:16,564 --> 00:26:19,658
- He went to the flagpole.
- <i>Then whatd he do?</i>

347
00:26:19,734 --> 00:26:21,793
<i>He took down</i>
<i>the American flag.</i>

348
00:26:21,869 --> 00:26:24,429
Was he personally
under heavy fire at that time?

349
00:26:24,505 --> 00:26:28,407
- Yes, sir.
<i>- No more questions.</i>

350
00:26:28,476 --> 00:26:31,570
Captain, prior to receiving orders
from the accused to open fire,

351
00:26:31,646 --> 00:26:34,410
where was the point of greatest
concern for the safety of your men,

352
00:26:34,482 --> 00:26:38,851
the crowd below or the snipers
in the buildings across the way?

353
00:26:38,919 --> 00:26:42,480
- I'm not really sure.
- <i>You're not sure?</i>

354
00:26:42,556 --> 00:26:44,547
Well, I guess...

355
00:26:44,625 --> 00:26:46,889
Don't guess.
I'll repeat the question.

356
00:26:46,961 --> 00:26:50,294
Was the point of greatest concern
the crowd below...

357
00:26:50,364 --> 00:26:52,798
<i>or the snipers</i>
<i>across the way?</i>

358
00:26:54,302 --> 00:26:56,736
I would have to say
the snipers.

359
00:26:56,804 --> 00:26:59,705
Did you feel an immediate mortal
danger from the crowd as a whole?

360
00:26:59,774 --> 00:27:01,742
- I don't understand.
- <i>You don't understand?</i>

361
00:27:01,809 --> 00:27:04,869
- No, sir.
- Let me help you.

362
00:27:08,115 --> 00:27:09,707
Were you more worried...

363
00:27:09,784 --> 00:27:12,252
you'd be killed by these people
or by these people?

364
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,914
I wasn't thinking about that.
Have you ever been under fire?

365
00:27:14,989 --> 00:27:18,755
You didn't see the crowd firing, but
you did take fire from the snipers.

366
00:27:18,826 --> 00:27:21,761
Is that correct?

367
00:27:25,866 --> 00:27:28,164
Yes.

368

to arrive there.

370

on the bodies of the dead?

371
00:27:39,413 --> 00:27:41,040
No.

372
00:27:41,115 --> 00:27:44,107
<i>Did you remove any weapons from</i>
<i>the people you were treating?</i>

373
00:27:44,185 --> 00:27:45,209
<i>No.</i>

374
00:27:45,286 --> 00:27:48,585
<i>Not a single weapon</i>
<i>anywhere among the victims?</i>

375
00:27:48,656 --> 00:27:50,590
No, no weapons.

376
00:27:50,658 --> 00:27:54,754
In your opinion, is Yemen
a training ground for terrorists?

377
00:27:56,263 --> 00:27:58,561
Not at all.

378
00:27:58,632 --> 00:28:01,567
We met in Yemen.

379
00:28:01,635 --> 00:28:04,502

your clinic in order to witness...

- Yes.

382
00:28:11,112 --> 00:28:13,945

- Yes.

387

They're all marked exhibit "R."

388

620
00:41:52,132 --> 00:41:54,430
A third,
Sergeant Krasevitch, dies.

621
00:41:54,501 --> 00:41:56,901
You give your captain
an order which he doesn't follow;

622
00:41:56,970 --> 00:41:59,632
in fact, he questions.

623
00:41:59,706 --> 00:42:01,765
And then you said what?

624
00:42:01,841 --> 00:42:05,607
[Sighs] I don't remember.

625
00:42:05,679 --> 00:42:07,146
You don't remember
what you said next?

626
00:42:07,214 --> 00:42:09,614
It was combat,
not some training exercise.

627
00:42:09,683 --> 00:42:10,945
A moment later,
your men were shooting.

628
00:42:11,017 --> 00:42:11,813
What did you say
to make that happen?

629
00:42:11,885 --> 00:42:12,817
I don't know.

630
00:42:12,886 --> 00:42:16,617
You must have said something.
Captain Lee reversed himself.

631
00:42:16,690 --> 00:42:19,784
- What did you say?
- I don't know the exact words.

632
00:42:19,859 --> 00:42:21,053
- <i>Let me help you.</i>
- Your Honor.

633
00:42:21,127 --> 00:42:23,152
You said, "Waste the motherfuckers,"
didn't you?

634
00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:24,720
- No, no, no.
- You didn't say it?

635
00:42:24,798 --> 00:42:27,767
- It all happened so fast...
- You're under oath, Colonel!

636
00:42:29,402 --> 00:42:31,632
Let me refresh
your memory.

637
00:42:31,705 --> 00:42:34,469
This is exhibit "Q," a tape
recording made aboard...

638
00:42:34,541 --> 00:42:38,443
the U.S.S. <i>Wake Island</i> of all radio
communications received that day,

639
00:42:38,511 --> 00:42:41,105
including your exact words.

640
00:42:41,181 --> 00:42:43,411
<i>Your Honor, with your permission</i>
<i>I would like to play this tape.</i>

641
00:42:43,483 --> 00:42:45,348
If you got it on tape,
then thats what I said!

642
00:42:45,418 --> 00:42:47,978
They were killing my marines,
so, yeah, I said it!

643
00:42:48,054 --> 00:42:50,045
"Waste the motherfuckers!"

644
00:42:51,358 --> 00:42:53,155
- Are these "the motherfuckers"?
- Objection.

645
00:42:53,226 --> 00:42:54,454
- Overruled.
- Yes!

646
00:42:54,527 --> 00:42:56,995
- These?
- <i>[Hodges] Objection!</i>

647
00:42:57,063 --> 00:42:58,928
Yes!

648
00:42:58,999 --> 00:42:59,966
- These?
- <i>[Hodges] Objection!</i>

649
00:43:00,033 --> 00:43:01,523
- Overruled.
- Yes.

650
00:43:01,601 --> 00:43:03,262
Are these "the motherfuckers"...

651
00:43:03,336 --> 00:43:05,099
- that you ordered to be wasted?
- Your Honor.

652
00:43:05,171 --> 00:43:07,036
- Major.
- Yes!

653
00:43:07,107 --> 00:43:10,873
The crowd in front of the embassy
had no weapons, did they, Colonel?

654
00:43:10,944 --> 00:43:12,571
Objection. We found
no snipers' weapons either.

655
00:43:12,646 --> 00:43:14,705
Yes, they had weapons!

656
00:43:14,781 --> 00:43:16,715
You think there's
a script for fighting a war...

657
00:43:16,783 --> 00:43:17,943
without pissing somebody off?

658
00:43:18,018 --> 00:43:19,952
Follow the rules,
and nobody gets hurt?

659
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:22,511
Yes, innocent people probably died.

660
00:43:22,589 --> 00:43:24,523
Innocent people always die.

661
00:43:24,591 --> 00:43:27,492
But I did not exceed
my orders!

662
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:29,619
There are rules, and marines
are sworn to uphold them.

663
00:43:29,696 --> 00:43:33,132
I was not going to stand by
and see another marine die...

664
00:43:33,199 --> 00:43:35,463
just to live
by those fucking rules!

665
00:43:35,535 --> 00:43:38,527
- <i>[Gavel Pounding]</i>
- Colonel!

666
00:43:43,310 --> 00:43:45,335
Your Honor,
I request a recess.

667
00:43:45,412 --> 00:43:47,141
Major.

668
00:43:48,915 --> 00:43:52,351
The government is finished with
Colonel Childers, Your Honor.

669
00:43:52,419 --> 00:43:55,388
<i>[Judge] All right, Colonel,</i>
<i>you have your recess.</i>

670
00:43:55,455 --> 00:43:58,390
[Indistinct Chatter]

671
00:43:58,458 --> 00:44:00,483
[Sighs]

672
00:44:02,662 --> 00:44:04,425
Why didn't you tell me
what you said?

673
00:44:04,497 --> 00:44:06,931
- I didn't remember.
- "Waste the motherfuckers."

674
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,366
Thats brilliant.
You didn't think that was important?

675
00:44:09,436 --> 00:44:10,869
Why didn't you know
about the goddamn recording?

676
00:44:10,937 --> 00:44:13,872
- You're supposed to know...
- I had a week to prepare this case.

677
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:15,032
I didn't realize
what a fuckup I'm defending.

678
00:44:15,108 --> 00:44:17,474
- Well, now you know.
- Goddamn.

679
00:44:23,516 --> 00:44:25,677
- [Sighs]
- [Sighs]

680
00:44:28,321 --> 00:44:30,482
[Sighs]

681
00:44:30,557 --> 00:44:33,253
- This is going to take us both down.
- How's that work?

682
00:44:33,326 --> 00:44:36,762
You gonna spend the rest
of your life in prison too?

683
00:44:43,002 --> 00:44:45,197
[Both Sighing]

684
00:44:47,207 --> 00:44:49,641
- [Sighs]
- I'm sorry.

685
00:44:50,944 --> 00:44:53,640
[Exhales]

686
00:44:53,713 --> 00:44:57,205
- I really screwed up in there, huh?
- Yeah, you really did.

687
00:44:57,283 --> 00:44:59,717
[Chuckles]
Whew!

688
00:44:59,786 --> 00:45:02,880
- So what happens now?
- Shit, I don't know.

689
00:45:02,956 --> 00:45:07,086
[Sighs]
I don't know.

690
00:45:09,129 --> 00:45:10,926
Your Honor, the government
calls Colonel Bin Le Cao...

691
00:45:10,997 --> 00:45:13,090
- as a rebuttal witness.
- Objection, Your Honor.

692
00:45:13,166 --> 00:45:15,259
What are the grounds for
this rebuttal witness to be allowed?

693
00:45:15,335 --> 00:45:17,895
Will counsel please
approach the bench.

694
00:45:23,810 --> 00:45:27,109
- Who is Colonel Bin Le Cao?
- A North Vietnamese Colonel...

695
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:29,239
who fought against Colonel Childers
at the battle of Ca Lu.

696
00:45:29,315 --> 00:45:32,512
What he has to say directly refutes
statements made by Colonel Childers.

697
00:45:32,585 --> 00:45:35,019
- When was the battle of Ca Lu?
- 1968.

698
00:45:35,088 --> 00:45:38,785
This is uncharged misconduct. It is
not allowable under military law.

699
00:45:38,858 --> 00:45:41,258
How do you know this witness
is going to charge misconduct?

700
00:45:41,327 --> 00:45:42,294
I'm assuming...

701
00:45:42,362 --> 00:45:44,262
He knows because he was
at the battle of Ca Lu.

702
00:45:44,330 --> 00:45:46,264
- Is that true?
- Yes, sir.

703
00:45:46,332 --> 00:45:49,199
On what grounds are you
calling your witness?

704
00:45:49,269 --> 00:45:51,464
Colonel Hodges made Colonel
Childers' combat experience...

705
00:45:51,538 --> 00:45:52,971
part of his defense.

706
00:45:53,039 --> 00:45:54,973
Furthermore,
Colonel Childers testified...

707
00:45:55,041 --> 00:45:56,975
that he never shoots unarmed people.

708
00:45:57,043 --> 00:46:01,104
<i>My witness has an important</i>
<i>perspective on that statement.</i>

709
00:46:03,850 --> 00:46:06,444
I'm gonna allow
the witness.

710
00:46:19,899 --> 00:46:21,264
<i>[Biggs]</i>
<i>Do you swear or affirm...</i>

711
00:46:21,334 --> 00:46:22,824
<i>that the evidence you shall give</i>
<i>in this case...</i>

712
00:46:22,902 --> 00:46:24,426
<i>shall be the truth,</i>
<i>the whole truth...</i>

713
00:46:24,504 --> 00:46:26,404
<i>and nothing but the truth,</i>
<i>so help you God?</i>

714
00:46:26,473 --> 00:46:29,067
<i>[Cao]</i>
<i>Yes, I do.</i>

715
00:46:29,142 --> 00:46:30,609
Will you please state
your name for the court?

716
00:46:30,677 --> 00:46:35,376
- My name is Bin Le Cao.
- In 1968, you were a colonel...

717
00:46:35,448 --> 00:46:38,440
with the North Vietnamese army,
B3 regiment, involved in a fight...

718
00:46:38,518 --> 00:46:42,215
with American marines at Ca Lu
in the Quang Tri province?

719
00:46:42,288 --> 00:46:43,778
Yes, I was.

720
00:46:43,857 --> 00:46:45,916
Will you tell the court
about that battle?

721
00:46:45,992 --> 00:46:49,086
We were aware that
small units of Americans...

722
00:46:49,162 --> 00:46:52,256
were near
my company of men.

723
00:46:52,332 --> 00:46:55,699
We found ourselves
behind your forces.

724
00:46:55,768 --> 00:46:59,431
This was lucky for us
because we were outnumbered.

725
00:47:03,810 --> 00:47:05,744
Do you recognize
this man?

726
00:47:07,347 --> 00:47:09,281
Yes.

727
00:47:09,349 --> 00:47:11,749
<i>Did he capture you and your</i>
<i>radio operator that day?</i>

728
00:47:11,818 --> 00:47:12,910
Yes.

729
00:47:12,986 --> 00:47:16,752
Did he remove your weapons
and place you under armed guard?

730
00:47:16,823 --> 00:47:17,755
<i>Yes.</i>

731
00:47:17,824 --> 00:47:19,689
<i>Did you consider yourself</i>
<i>a prisoner of war?</i>

732
00:47:19,759 --> 00:47:22,421
Yes.

733
00:47:22,495 --> 00:47:24,622
Did he execute
your radio operator?

734
00:47:26,866 --> 00:47:28,800
Yes.

735
00:47:28,868 --> 00:47:31,701
You personally saw him shoot
a fellow prisoner of war?

736
00:47:31,771 --> 00:47:34,069
Yes.

737
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:36,574
<i>[Biggs]</i>
<i>Where did he shoot him?</i>

738
00:47:36,643 --> 00:47:38,702
<i>[Cao]</i>
<i>In the head.</i>

739
00:47:38,778 --> 00:47:41,042
<i>Thank you.</i>
<i>No further questions.</i>

740
00:47:45,451 --> 00:47:49,547
[Sighs] Were your men annihilating
that platoon of marines?

741
00:47:49,622 --> 00:47:51,556
Yes.

742
00:47:51,624 --> 00:47:54,616
Did Colonel Childers force you
to call your men off?

743
00:47:54,694 --> 00:47:56,719
Yes.

744
00:47:56,796 --> 00:47:58,730
Do you believe his actions
were calculated to save...

745
00:47:58,798 --> 00:48:02,825
- the lives of American marines?
- Yes.

746
00:48:02,902 --> 00:48:05,302
Would you have done the same
thing Colonel Childers did...

747
00:48:05,371 --> 00:48:07,305
if the situation
had been reversed?

748
00:48:14,814 --> 00:48:16,748
Colonel Cao, would you have shot...

749
00:48:16,816 --> 00:48:19,250
a captive American radio operator
in the head if you thought...

750
00:48:19,319 --> 00:48:24,018
it would persuade Colonel Childers
to spare the lives of your own men?

751
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:30,251
Yes.

752
00:48:33,066 --> 00:48:36,001
No more questions.

753
00:48:36,069 --> 00:48:38,503
<i>[Judge] This court is in recess</i>

00:48:38,571 --> 00:48:40,505
<i>- We will hear closing arguments.</i>

- Perry, good to see you too.

756
00:48:52,919 --> 00:48:55,615
I want you to meet
my grandson.

757
00:48:55,688 --> 00:48:57,986
<i>Hi. Nice to meet</i>
<i>you, sir.</i>

758
00:48:58,057 --> 00:49:00,082
Thanks.

759
00:49:03,696 --> 00:49:06,563
<i>[Biggs] Colonel Terry Childers</i>
<i>is a decorated war hero,</i>

760
00:49:06,633 --> 00:49:09,363
a trusted leader
of American marines,

761
00:49:09,435 --> 00:49:12,802
and I wish that was
all there was to it.

762
00:49:12,872 --> 00:49:16,205
Unfortunately, there are
83 dead Yemeni citizens,

763
00:49:16,275 --> 00:49:19,438
many of them
women and children.

764
00:49:19,512 --> 00:49:23,505
Colonel Hodges would have you
believe that this crowd was armed.

765
00:49:23,583 --> 00:49:25,915
He would also have you believe
that there is a videotape...

766
00:49:25,985 --> 00:49:28,317
proving this to be true.

767
00:49:31,357 --> 00:49:35,225
There is no tape
exonerating Colonel Childers.

768
00:49:35,294 --> 00:49:38,991
There is no evidence
exonerating Colonel Childers!

769
00:49:46,305 --> 00:49:50,901
Is Colonel Childers a man capable of
killing defenseless, unarmed people?

770
00:49:52,578 --> 00:49:55,240
Is he capable of ordering
the execution...

771
00:49:55,314 --> 00:49:58,681
of innocent
men and women?

772
00:49:58,751 --> 00:50:03,848
Is he capable of executing
P.O.W. S with his own hand?

773
00:50:03,923 --> 00:50:06,756
Unfortunately,
we have shown that he is.

774
00:50:06,826 --> 00:50:09,317
You have heard the sad testimony
of Colonel Cao...

775
00:50:09,395 --> 00:50:12,660
who witnessed Colonel Childers'
barbarism firsthand.

776
00:50:14,767 --> 00:50:17,668
You've even heard
Colonel Childers' own admission...

777
00:50:17,737 --> 00:50:22,106
that his desire was to "waste"
them, regardless of who they were.

778
00:50:25,745 --> 00:50:29,841
Now, we are faced
with the difficult prospect...

779
00:50:29,916 --> 00:50:32,282
of convicting
one of our own.

780
00:50:32,351 --> 00:50:35,320
None of us wants to do this,
but you've heard the facts,

781
00:50:35,388 --> 00:50:37,618
and it is unavoidable.

782
00:50:37,690 --> 00:50:41,626
Colonel Terry Childers ordered
the senseless slaughter...

783
00:50:41,694 --> 00:50:44,561
of a peaceful crowd!

784
00:50:44,630 --> 00:50:48,726
<i>Now, as marines,</i>

785
00:50:48,801 --> 00:50:52,828
<i>we do not get the luxury</i>
<i>of covering up our mistakes.</i>

786
00:50:52,905 --> 00:50:55,669
We must air them,

787
00:50:55,742 --> 00:50:59,303
thereby ensuring
that they never happen again.

788
00:50:59,378 --> 00:51:02,142
Thank you.

789
00:51:09,322 --> 00:51:11,256
Thats sovereign
United States territory...

790
00:51:11,324 --> 00:51:14,259
as much as if it were
in Ohio or Maryland.

791
00:51:14,327 --> 00:51:16,818
Colonel Childers didn't
volunteer to go over there.

792
00:51:16,896 --> 00:51:19,922
He was ordered to go there because
he was the best man for the job.

793
00:51:19,999 --> 00:51:21,990
We armed him.
We trained him.

794
00:51:22,068 --> 00:51:24,662
We sent him over there to risk
his life to save other Americans.

795
00:51:24,737 --> 00:51:28,173
And then ask him
not to return fire?

796
00:51:28,241 --> 00:51:31,938
There are over 300 bullet holes
in this building.

797
00:51:32,011 --> 00:51:36,710
Colonel Childers didn't open fire.
He <i>returned</i> fire.

798
00:51:36,783 --> 00:51:40,719
And he waited until after three
of his marines were dead...

799
00:51:40,787 --> 00:51:43,051
and another lay
mortally wounded.

800
00:51:43,122 --> 00:51:45,647
He waited until he was
personally under heavy fire.

801
00:51:45,725 --> 00:51:49,752
He waited until he saw
that crowd holding weapons.

802
00:51:49,829 --> 00:51:53,390
Only then did he order
his men to return fire.

803
00:51:53,466 --> 00:51:55,331
Under the rules of engagement,
a civilian pointing a weapon...

804
00:51:55,401 --> 00:51:57,301
is no longer a civilian,

805
00:51:57,370 --> 00:51:59,998
and the use of deadly force
is authorized...

806
00:52:00,072 --> 00:52:03,564
in order to save lives.

807
00:52:03,643 --> 00:52:06,134
Its not murder.

808
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:09,214
Its combat.

809
00:52:10,516 --> 00:52:12,677
<i>Colonel Childers is</i>
<i>the only man alive...</i>

810
00:52:12,752 --> 00:52:15,084
who was in a position
to see that crowd.

811
00:52:15,154 --> 00:52:17,748
But the camera on the embassy
roof had the same point of view.

812
00:52:17,824 --> 00:52:19,621
The government
would have you believe...

813
00:52:19,692 --> 00:52:21,751
there's no tape
from that camera.

814
00:52:21,828 --> 00:52:25,264
I have shown you that that tape was
delivered to the State Department.

815
00:52:25,331 --> 00:52:27,822
Do you believe that tape
got up and walked out...

816
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:30,266
of the State Department
on its own?

817
00:52:32,338 --> 00:52:34,636
By not producing that tape,
the national security advisor,

818
00:52:34,707 --> 00:52:38,700
Mr. Sokal, has brought dishonor
into this court.

819
00:52:38,778 --> 00:52:42,407
<i>Without that tape, I cannot show</i>
<i>you that the crowd fired first...</i>

820
00:52:42,481 --> 00:52:44,642
and that Colonel Childers
is innocent.

821
00:52:44,717 --> 00:52:47,618
But without that tape,
they cannot prove...

822
00:52:47,687 --> 00:52:50,781
beyond a reasonable doubt
that he's guilty!

And I know how
the ambassador feels,

00:53:13,546 --> 00:53:15,810
because Colonel Childers
saved my life too.

I'm alive today because of him.

My son is sitting in
this courtroom because of him.

because of the heroism
of Colonel Childers.

837
00:53:26,492 --> 00:53:30,519
To ask this man to risk his life
for his country,

838
00:53:32,965 --> 00:53:37,026
to ask this man to watch
his marines die in his arms...

839
00:53:37,103 --> 00:53:39,628
and call it murder
when he's defending himself,

840
00:53:39,705 --> 00:53:42,936
call it murder for firing back
when fired upon...

841

To call it murder for saving
the lives of his countrymen...

<i>wounded on a battlefield.</i>

a United States Marine.
