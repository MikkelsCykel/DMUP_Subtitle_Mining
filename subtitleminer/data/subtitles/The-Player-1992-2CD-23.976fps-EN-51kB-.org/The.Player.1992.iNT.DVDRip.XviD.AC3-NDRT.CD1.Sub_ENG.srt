1
00:00:14,222 --> 00:00:15,807
Quiet on the set.

2
00:00:17,475 --> 00:00:19,519
Scene one, take ten.
Marker.

3
00:00:26,818 --> 00:00:29,362
And action!

4
00:00:31,614 --> 00:00:33,575
Joel Levison's office.

5
00:00:33,658 --> 00:00:37,203
I'm sorry, he's not in yet.
May I take a message?

6
00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:40,081
- Mr. Levy, I'll tell him you called.
- Never say that.

7
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:43,501
He's either in conference, in a meeting.
He's always in.

8
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:45,754
- Who was that?
- Larry Levy.

9
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:49,632
Was there anything in the trades
this morning?

10
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:53,261
- I don't know. The mail's late.
- Go get them. Now!

11
00:00:53,344 --> 00:00:56,556
I want them back here
before he arrives.

12
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:15,533
Griffin, hi. Adam Simon.

13
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:17,952
We weren't supposed to meet
until next week, but-

14
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:22,081
- I didn't know we were.
- I wanted to plant a seed in your head.

15
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:24,667
- I'm booked up.
- Picture this.

16
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:27,420
It's a planet in the far future
with two suns.

17
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:29,714
- Who plays the sons?
- No, suns. Large solar disks.

18
00:01:29,797 --> 00:01:31,716
Run this idea by Bonnie Sherow.

19
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:35,178
The pictures they make these days
are all MTV. Cut, cut, cut.

20
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:38,723
The opening shot of Touch of Evil
was six and a half minutes long.

21
00:01:38,806 --> 00:01:41,267
- Six and a half minutes?
- Three or four, anyway.

22
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:44,562
He set up the whole picture
with that one tracking shot.

23
00:01:44,646 --> 00:01:47,023
My father was key grip on that shoot.

24
00:01:47,106 --> 00:01:51,319
What about Absolute Beginners?
That was an extraordinary shot.

25
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:54,656
- Never heard of it.
- It's an English film.

26
00:01:59,035 --> 00:02:02,121
- A Peligrino, please.
- I've got Calistoga.

27
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:04,249
- Buck, how are you?
- Good. How you doin'?

28
00:02:04,332 --> 00:02:08,670
- Good. What have you got for me?
- Okay, here it is.

29
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:11,589
- The Graduate, Part II.
- Oh, good.

30
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:14,676
Listen, the three principals
are still with us.

31
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:20,223
Dustin Hoffman, Anne Bancroft,
Katharine Ross, 25 years later.

32
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:25,270
And so are the characters,
Ben, Elaine and Mrs. Robinson.

33
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:27,272
Ben and Elaine are married, still.

34
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:32,026
They live in a big, spooky house
up in northern California somewhere.

35
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:35,196
And Mrs. Robinson
lives with them...

36
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,993
her aging mother
who's had a stroke...

37
00:02:40,034 --> 00:02:41,995
so she can't talk.

38
00:02:42,036 --> 00:02:45,623
- Will it be funny?
- It'll be funny. Dark, weird and funny.

39
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:49,043
And with a stroke.
Maybe it's not a stroke.

40
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:51,796
I don't know what it is.
It's a malady of some sort.

41
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:55,466
She's up in the bedroom listening
to everything that happens.

42
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:58,469
They've got a daughter
who's just graduated from college.

43
00:02:58,553 --> 00:03:02,890
Twenty-two, twenty-three-year-old,
like a Julia Roberts.

44
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:04,976
Excuse me.
What should I do with these scripts?

45
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:10,398
They go to Bonnie. And find out from
security how Adam Simon got on the lot.

46
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:14,402
- I want to know.
- Adam Simon? Okay.

47
00:03:14,485 --> 00:03:17,572
Julia Roberts comes home,
their daughter, the graduate.

48
00:03:17,655 --> 00:03:19,490
The new graduate.

49
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:22,201
Griffin loved it.
He wanted me to run it by you.

50
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:27,623
- It's a band of human survivors.
- Write this down for me.

51
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:30,793
I can't process this.
Write it down for me.

52
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:34,005
It's not about words.
You have to visualize.

53
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:41,471
Jimmy, are you okay?
What happened?

54
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:46,350
- Are you all right?
- My name's Jimmy Chase.

55
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:52,064
He came out of nowhere, ran right
in front of the cart. I never saw him.

56
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:59,322
- That's Adam Simon.
- How you doin', kid?

57
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:12,126
Rebecca DeMornay.
Actually, you're better looking.

58
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:15,254
- No, I'm not Rebecca DeMornay.
- You're a dead ringer.

59
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:17,006
Thank you very much.

60
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:19,842
Do you know where
Joel Levison's office is?

61
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:22,762
The head of the studio?

62
00:04:22,803 --> 00:04:24,764
It's moving.
It'll rip your heart out.

63
00:04:24,805 --> 00:04:29,685
This is the area where we make decisions
to give a green light to a picture.

64
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:34,273
We're going to go 17 stories high.
We'll continue to use all Sony products.

65
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:37,360
Domo arigato to the Sony products.

66
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:41,948
If you need someone to eat sashimi
with you, give me a ring.

67
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:50,498
The traffic from Malibu
was impossible.

68
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:54,168
- Good morning, Joel.
- Sandy, park the car, please.

69
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:56,254
Good morning Marty, Annie.

70
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:03,052
- What are the Japs doing here?
- What's this talk about heads rolling?

71
00:05:03,135 --> 00:05:06,264
The bank's putting screws to us.
Goldman's son is coming out from Boston.

72
00:05:06,347 --> 00:05:07,765
I don't like it.

73
00:05:07,848 --> 00:05:11,310
Reggie Goldman's a pipsqueak.
You can't be serious.

74
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:15,606
Some changes are going on here.
That's always the way.

75
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:18,526
It happened at Paramount
three years ago.

76
00:05:18,567 --> 00:05:20,653
Columbia's going through it now.

77
00:05:20,736 --> 00:05:23,030
I hear we're looking
to replace Griffin.

78
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:25,408
Griffin? I don't believe it.
With whom?

79
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:28,869
Burke or Patrick.
Maybe Larry Levy.

80
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:32,665
I want to know why
the security is lax.

81
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:35,710
I'll talk to you later.
I'm in the middle of a pitch.

82
00:05:35,793 --> 00:05:37,962
Listen, go ahead.

83
00:05:38,045 --> 00:05:43,342
- It's a TV star who goes on a safari.
- A TV star in a motion picture?

84
00:05:43,384 --> 00:05:48,347
- A TV star played by a movie star.
- A movie star playing a TV star.

85
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:52,727
- Michelle, Bette, Lily.
- Dolly Parton would be good.

86
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:58,065
- I like Goldie.
- Great, because we have a relationship.

87
00:05:58,149 --> 00:06:00,609
Goldie goes to Africa.

88
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:06,365
- She's found by this tribe.
- Of small people.

89
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:09,326
She's found and they worship her.

90
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:14,206
It's like The Gods Must Be Crazy
except the coke bottle is an actress.

91
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:16,876
Right. It's Out of Africa
meets Pretty Woman.

92
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:20,546
She has to decide whether to stay
with the TV show...

93
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:23,090
or save the tribe.

94
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:26,135
- Where's Griffin Mill's office?
- Right here.

95
00:06:26,218 --> 00:06:29,138
- You're Martin Scorsese!
- No, but I know Harvey Keitel.

96
00:06:29,221 --> 00:06:32,725
I know you do.
I loved Cape Fear.

97
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:35,478
My old man worked for Hitchcock.

98
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:37,813
Rope. It was a masterpiece.

99
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:40,691
The story wasn't any good.
He shot the whole thing without cuts.

100
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:42,651
I hate all this 'Cut, cut, cut!'

101
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:48,240
What about Bertolucci, the great shot
with Winger in Sheltering Sky?

102
00:06:48,282 --> 00:06:50,367
I didn't see it.

103
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:57,750
- I've been here since 8:00.
- I took a chance getting you this job.

104
00:06:57,833 --> 00:07:01,796
- Who were you with?
- I was with Alan Rudolph.

105
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:06,801
- What were you doing with him?
- He asked me to have coffee.

106
00:07:06,842 --> 00:07:09,428
You're my assistant.
You don't get involved with writers.

107
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:12,389
I wasn't getting involved. I was
listening to this amazing idea he had.

108
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:14,975
That's interesting.
What's your pitch?

109
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:18,479
- Does political scare you?
- Political doesn't scare me.

110
00:07:18,562 --> 00:07:21,273
Radical political scares me.
Political political scares me.

111
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:24,860
This is politely politically radical,
but it's funny.

112
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:29,240
- It's a funny political thing.
- And it's a thriller, too, all at once.

113
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:33,452
-What's the story?
-I want Bruce Willis. I can talk to him.

114
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:36,997
It's a story about a bad-guy senator.

115
00:07:37,081 --> 00:07:41,544
He's traveling around the country
on the country's dime, like Sununu did.

116
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:44,088
It's a cynical, political
thriller comedy.

117
00:07:44,171 --> 00:07:49,426
But it's got heart in the right spot.
Anyway, he has an accident.

118
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:54,306
And he becomes clairvoyant,
like a psychic.

119
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:57,476
So it's a psychic, political,
thriller comedy with a heart.

120
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:01,897
With a heart, not unlike Ghost
meets Manchurian Candidate.

121
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:05,484
- Go on, I'm listening.
- He starts reading people's minds.

122
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:10,155
And when he gets to the President's mind
it's completely blank.

123
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:12,491
- Can I get you anything?
- I'd like a beer, please.

124
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:15,661
- We don't have beer.
- Red wine, please.

125
00:08:17,371 --> 00:08:22,418
Someone gets killed at the end.
They always do in political thrillers.

126
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:26,797
- Griffin Mill's office.
- Can you put him on?

127
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:30,593
- May I ask who's calling?
- I'd like to speak to Griffin Mill.

128
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:34,847
He's in a meeting right now. I can take
your name and have him get back to you.

129
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:38,309
- Excuse me?
- He'll get back to me?

130
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:41,812
- Do you know how often I've heard this?
- Who is this?

131
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:44,982
- If he doesn't get back to me-
- Who was that?

132
00:08:45,065 --> 00:08:48,068
- I don't know. He didn't say.
- What do you mean?

133
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:53,449
I don't know how you'll cast it. The
lead is a 50-year-old circus performer.

134
00:08:53,532 --> 00:08:55,868
Let me read the coverage.

135
00:08:55,951 --> 00:08:58,037
Are we still having lunch
with Aaron Camp?

136
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:01,206
- What time?
- I made it for 1:00.

137
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:03,709
- Bad day?
- He's having writer's block.

138
00:09:05,794 --> 00:09:10,257
You have a meeting with Hutter and
Frank South this afternoon at 3:00.

139
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:14,011
I'll be here. Put this morning's
meetings on the computer. Thanks.

140
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:18,223
- Are you going now?
- I'm going to see Levison.

141
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:21,226
Order me a Caesar salad
and a Crystal Geyser.

142
00:09:29,276 --> 00:09:32,654
About 5:00? Thanks, Sandy.

143
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:35,032
Hi, Sandy.

144
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:38,202
You can't go in there!
He's in a meeting.

145
00:09:39,369 --> 00:09:42,206
It's all right, Celia.

146
00:09:42,289 --> 00:09:45,918
I don't think you've met Reg Goldman.
You know his father Harvey.

147
00:09:46,001 --> 00:09:49,713
Yes, of course. Hi, Reg.
From the bank in Boston.

148
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:54,885
- Reg is out here for a few weeks.
- Great. Business or pleasure?

149
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:57,554
A little of both, I hope.

150
00:09:57,596 --> 00:09:59,389
Reg is thinking of producing.

151
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:01,475
Really?

152
00:10:01,558 --> 00:10:03,852
Yeah. Beats work,
doesn't it, Griffin?

153
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:06,271
I'd like to play some tennis.
Do you play tennis?

154
00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:08,732
Tennis? No.

155
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:11,443
- I'm too busy.
- I was asking Walter.

156
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:13,862
Do you know Meg Ryan?

157
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:15,906
Is she seeing somebody?

158
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:19,576
Yeah, Reg. She's married.

159
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:22,204
Shit.

160
00:10:22,287 --> 00:10:24,915
What about Winona Ryder?

161
00:10:24,998 --> 00:10:29,878
You know, actually,
Walter is the guy to talk to.

162
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:32,297
Walter's got everybody's number.

163
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:36,468
- Was there anything?
- No. You're real busy.

164
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:39,930
I want that number, goddamn it.
I want that number.

165
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:43,600
Oh, boy. What about this one?
Has she done anything?

166
00:10:44,726 --> 00:10:46,144
Celia.

167
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:50,566
Griffin, don't ask.

168
00:10:50,649 --> 00:10:55,070
Don't ask, you don't know?
Or don't ask, I don't want to know?

169
00:10:55,153 --> 00:10:57,447
Just don't ask.

170
00:10:58,574 --> 00:11:03,328
If it's Reggie Goldman
you're concerned about, forget it.

171
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:05,914
But be nice to him. He represents
a lot of money to this company.

172
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:09,042
It's not Reggie Goldman
I'm worried about.

173
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:11,670
- It's Larry Levy.
- Larry Levy?

174
00:11:12,671 --> 00:11:15,090
Larry Levy's at Fox, isn't he?

175
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:19,177
Come on, Celia.

176
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:22,389
There's a call for Celia
on line one.

177
00:11:22,472 --> 00:11:25,892
- Should I be looking for a job?
- Celia, are you there?

178
00:11:25,976 --> 00:11:30,314
Joel Levison's office.
Oh, Brad. Yeah.

179
00:11:30,355 --> 00:11:31,898
What?

180
00:11:31,982 --> 00:11:36,486
No, we couldn't sign Angelica Huston
for that. She's booked for two years.

181
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:41,158
Like a ghost story,
but it's not like Ghost.

182
00:11:44,661 --> 00:11:46,830
It's a supernatural thing.

183
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:52,044
Joel, Griffin Mill.
A friend of Jennifer's.

184
00:11:52,127 --> 00:11:55,255
No. You're Griffin Mill?
Really?

185
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:57,257
Good to see you.
I'm a big fan of yours.

186
00:11:57,341 --> 00:12:00,010
- I have that tie.
- You do?

187
00:12:06,433 --> 00:12:08,560
Did you order for me?

188
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:14,733
Hi. Lunching with the enemy.

189
00:12:14,816 --> 00:12:16,777
Oh, come on.

190
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:19,988
So what's this we hear
about Larry Levy?

191
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:23,700
Larry Levy? If he had half a brain,
he'd be dangerous.

192
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:28,038
Aaron says he's coming
to the studio.

193
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:32,751
Aaron says? Why would you believe
anything he says?

194
00:12:32,834 --> 00:12:35,545
He said it with authority.

195
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:40,384
He's over there with Angelica Huston
and John Cusack.

196
00:12:40,467 --> 00:12:43,553
He's in over his head.
He's gonna drown over there.

197
00:12:44,596 --> 00:12:47,140
He's the golden boy at Fox these days.

198
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:50,060
Did you see that thing on him
in Variety last week?

199
00:12:50,143 --> 00:12:51,686
Two pages.

200
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:55,690
Angelica, Griffin Mill.
Good to see you. You're looking great.

201
00:12:55,774 --> 00:12:58,735
Johnny, Griffin Mill.
A big fan of yours.

202
00:12:58,777 --> 00:13:01,863
- You gonna be in Telluride this year?
- Probably in Park City.

203
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:04,116
Great. We'll see you there.

204
00:13:05,784 --> 00:13:11,206
- What's happening with Glass Box?
- Let's not talk about Hollywood.

205
00:13:11,289 --> 00:13:13,834
We're educated people.

206
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:21,091
I'll call you later.

207
00:13:53,456 --> 00:13:55,917
- Talk to somebody about this.
- What?

208
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:58,795
- You've gotten 5 postcards in 2 weeks.
- Seven, actually.

209
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:01,464
Why don't you talk to Studio Security?

210
00:14:01,548 --> 00:14:03,675
I should call Walter Stuckel
and say what?

211
00:14:03,758 --> 00:14:08,471
'Someone's sending me poison letters
and I would like for you to make me...

212
00:14:08,513 --> 00:14:12,142
the object of more ridicule now that
things are really shaky for me here.(

213
00:14:12,225 --> 00:14:13,685
I don't think so.

214
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:15,770
I think they're coming from a writer.

215
00:14:15,854 --> 00:14:17,814
- Which one?
- Take your pick.

216
00:14:20,358 --> 00:14:22,694
- Is there anything else?
- Yes, your attorney phoned.

217
00:14:22,777 --> 00:14:25,614
He wants you to attend a party
at his house tonight.

218
00:14:25,697 --> 00:14:28,658
- Tell him I'm at a screening.
- Not that attorney. It's Dick Mellen.

219
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:30,160
What time?

220
00:14:30,201 --> 00:14:33,204
Cocktails at 7:30, dinner at 8:00.
Bring a date.

221
00:14:33,246 --> 00:14:35,498
And Bonnie Sherow is here to see you.

222
00:14:35,582 --> 00:14:38,543
Send her in.
Oh, here she is.

223
00:14:38,585 --> 00:14:41,671
Can we go to the Springs this weekend?

224
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:46,343
I want to have a massage,
a long soak in a hot tub...

225
00:14:46,384 --> 00:14:49,638
and have Margaritas administered
intravenously.

226
00:14:49,721 --> 00:14:51,931
I have a party at Dick Mellen's.
You want to come?

227
00:14:52,015 --> 00:14:54,559
God, movie stars and power players.

228
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:57,562
- And Vodka.
- Sure.

229
00:14:57,646 --> 00:15:00,857
It'll be an early dinner,
and we'll go to my place afterwards.

230
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:02,859
- Can we?
- Yeah.

231
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:19,167
Brokaw looks like he has
absolutely no intensity.

232
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:21,961
Ted Koppel looks loose,
and he goes after it...

233
00:15:22,045 --> 00:15:24,339
and he digs in.

234
00:15:28,593 --> 00:15:31,137
Hi. How are you?

235
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:33,515
Marlee, this is Bonnie Sherow.

236
00:15:33,556 --> 00:15:36,351
She read Tales of Fury.

237
00:15:37,477 --> 00:15:40,522
I loved it.
I thought it was wonderful.

238
00:15:40,605 --> 00:15:44,442
I think you're perfect for Ariel.
You're perfect for the part.

239
00:15:45,777 --> 00:15:48,696
We're going to make a couple changes
in the third act.

240
00:15:48,738 --> 00:15:50,740
You should set up a meeting.

241
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:54,369
Yeah, sure.

242
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:56,413
- You have my number?
- Absolutely.

243
00:15:57,997 --> 00:16:00,500
Excuse me.
I'm going to say hello to those people.

244
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:04,295
Don't talk about script changes
at parties.

245
00:16:04,379 --> 00:16:08,216
It was good of you to come.
Don't you look beautiful!

246
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:11,177
- You know Bonnie Sherow.
- Of course. How are you?

247
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:14,305
- Tri-Star, right?
- She's at the studio.

248
00:16:14,389 --> 00:16:19,686
That's what I meant. Bring Mr. Mill
a martini. And, Bonnie?

249
00:16:19,769 --> 00:16:22,730
- I'll take a Ramlosa.
- I'll have a martini.

250
00:16:25,108 --> 00:16:28,027
Rod Steiger's here.

251
00:16:28,111 --> 00:16:30,029
Talk to him about the Rudolph project.

252
00:16:30,113 --> 00:16:34,450
He's not that hot on it,
but see if you can get him to read it.

253
00:16:34,534 --> 00:16:37,245
You know who's here? Harry Belafonte.
Harry?

254
00:16:37,328 --> 00:16:39,956
Come and say hello, will you?

255
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:44,711
- Griffin Mill.
- Hi. Good to see you.

256
00:16:44,794 --> 00:16:47,630
Bonnie Sherow.
She's gaga over you.

257
00:16:47,714 --> 00:16:51,426
I'm a big fan of yours. I saw you accept
the Nelson Mandela Courage Award.

258
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:56,472
Who was the villain in Ghostbusters?

259
00:16:56,556 --> 00:16:59,434
You got me there.

260
00:16:59,475 --> 00:17:01,519
I got this-

261
00:17:03,521 --> 00:17:08,276
I got this postcard.
Harassment kind of stuff.

262
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:11,112
What are you talking about?

263
00:17:12,822 --> 00:17:15,116
It's some writer
I must've brushed off.

264
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,411
Get something to eat.
There's lovely stuff over there.

265
00:17:18,494 --> 00:17:20,663
We will in a few minutes.

266
00:17:20,747 --> 00:17:22,457
Your hands are as cold as mine.

267
00:17:22,498 --> 00:17:25,293
Would you like one of these?

268
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:27,503
I don't think I do.

269
00:17:27,587 --> 00:17:30,298
Are you talking about threats?

270
00:17:30,381 --> 00:17:32,967
No. Yes.

271
00:17:33,009 --> 00:17:36,387
I don't know.
He's pissed off.

272
00:17:36,471 --> 00:17:40,808
I thought writers were your long suit.
You're the writer's executive.

273
00:17:40,892 --> 00:17:43,144
Are you pitching me a dream?

274
00:17:43,186 --> 00:17:47,690
- You don't sound sincerely interested.
- It depends how good the dream is.

275
00:17:49,192 --> 00:17:50,985
Levy's here.

276
00:17:54,364 --> 00:17:59,202
- Dick, what's he doing here?
- Goldblum? He's a friend.

277
00:17:59,285 --> 00:18:02,163
- No, Larry Levy.
- He came with Sally.

278
00:18:02,246 --> 00:18:04,499
What's going on with my job?

279
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:07,835
Everywhere I look,
Larry Levy is in my face.

280
00:18:07,877 --> 00:18:11,673
Larry Levy is a comer. That's what
comers do, they get in your face.

281
00:18:11,714 --> 00:18:14,676
You're a comer, too. You can handle it.
Stop worrying about him.

282
00:18:14,717 --> 00:18:16,844
So the rumors are true?

283
00:18:16,928 --> 00:18:18,846
Rumors are always true.

284
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:23,434
-I'm always the last to hear about them.
-You're the last one to believe.

285
00:18:23,518 --> 00:18:25,311
Am I out?

286
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:28,398
You're not out, but you'd better
start thinking about a roommate.

287
00:18:28,481 --> 00:18:31,859
Relax, you can handle this.
You can make it work for you.

288
00:18:31,943 --> 00:18:35,738
- Larry?
- Dick. Sorry to crash your party.

289
00:18:35,822 --> 00:18:39,534
- Do you know everybody?
- I will before the night's out.

290
00:18:39,575 --> 00:18:41,619
You will, indeed.

291
00:18:44,455 --> 00:18:48,126
- Great party, Dick.
- Good. Did you get some food?

292
00:18:53,005 --> 00:18:55,007
Listen to this.

293
00:18:55,091 --> 00:18:57,885
'He lifts her dress.
She kisses him harder.

294
00:18:57,969 --> 00:19:01,764
He puts his hands in her underpants.
She grabs his shoulders.

295
00:19:01,848 --> 00:19:06,602
He pulls her dress above her waist.
He rubs against her wide, soft belly.

296
00:19:06,686 --> 00:19:11,232
Slowly he pushes her panties down
to her knees. She's faint with passion.

297
00:19:11,315 --> 00:19:14,527
She arches her back and
he lowers her down onto the buckboard.

298
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:19,073
The horses snort and whinny.
They, too, feel her passion.

299
00:19:19,157 --> 00:19:21,909
The camera moves in
on the nostrils of the horse...

300
00:19:21,951 --> 00:19:25,288
as the buckboard begins to shake.(

301
00:19:25,371 --> 00:19:29,208
God! Do you believe that?
Steve recommended that script.

302
00:19:29,292 --> 00:19:33,087
He says they're hot for it at Universal.
They're gonna have a bidding war.

303
00:19:33,171 --> 00:19:36,716
I heard a pitch today. It wasn't bad.
Stuck on a story point, though.

304
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:41,429
- I'm a story editor. Go.
- New York City, big advertising agency.

305
00:19:41,512 --> 00:19:44,640
An account executive makes
a presentation to a potential client.

306
00:19:44,724 --> 00:19:47,185
The client promises
to get back to him.

307
00:19:47,268 --> 00:19:49,770
- Does it have to be advertising?
- That's not the problem.

308
00:19:49,854 --> 00:19:53,691
The account executive keeps waiting
for the client to call him back...

309
00:19:53,774 --> 00:19:57,278
to tell him what he thought
of the idea, if he got the job or not.

310
00:19:57,361 --> 00:19:59,780
But the client never calls.

311
00:19:59,822 --> 00:20:04,702
The account executive gets so pissed off
and frustrated, he becomes obsessive.

312
00:20:04,785 --> 00:20:08,206
- He decides to drive the client crazy.
- What does he do?

313
00:20:08,289 --> 00:20:12,793
Sends him threatening postcards.
It's not important.

314
00:20:12,877 --> 00:20:16,839
Here's the problem.
How long do you think...

315
00:20:16,881 --> 00:20:20,384
the account executive
harasses the client...

316
00:20:20,468 --> 00:20:22,803
before he becomes dangerous?

317
00:20:22,845 --> 00:20:25,890
- Does it have to be advertising?
- How long?

318
00:20:25,973 --> 00:20:28,434
If it were me-

319
00:20:28,517 --> 00:20:30,228
One month?

320
00:20:30,311 --> 00:20:32,980
Three months.
No, more. Five months.

321
00:20:33,022 --> 00:20:35,858
- To be dangerous, five months.
- That's what I thought.

322
00:20:35,942 --> 00:20:38,110
- Who's the writer?
- I don't know.

323
00:20:38,194 --> 00:20:40,821
You don't know the writer
who pitched you the idea?

324
00:20:40,863 --> 00:20:44,408
I don't know his name.
It's a couple kids.

325
00:20:45,868 --> 00:20:47,328
TV writers.

326
00:20:48,829 --> 00:20:52,792
Can we go to bed now?
I'm starting to wrinkle.

327
00:21:00,257 --> 00:21:02,176
- See you tomorrow afternoon.
- Absolutely.

328
00:21:02,259 --> 00:21:05,137
Burt, Larry Levy. I hope you don't
remember me, and if you do...

329
00:21:05,221 --> 00:21:09,517
I hope there are no hard feelings,
I was working for Gassner then.

330
00:21:14,605 --> 00:21:16,649
Take care.

331
00:21:16,732 --> 00:21:19,485
- Who was that?
- An exec over at Fox.

332
00:21:19,568 --> 00:21:21,654
Was until breakfast, anyway.

333
00:21:30,121 --> 00:21:32,873
- Good morning, Mr. Mill.
- Hi, Susan. How are you?

334
00:21:32,915 --> 00:21:35,543
I'm with Joel.

335
00:21:35,626 --> 00:21:38,713
- Hi, Burt. Griffin Mill.
- Good to see you.

336
00:21:38,796 --> 00:21:41,048
Hi, Charles. How are you?

337
00:21:41,132 --> 00:21:43,634
- Asshole.
- One of a breed.

338
00:21:45,761 --> 00:21:50,182
Actually, he's not. There's a whole
breed of them. They're breeding them.

339
00:21:50,266 --> 00:21:53,144
Joel, you're losing your touch,
scheduling meetings so close together.

340
00:21:53,227 --> 00:21:55,688
That guy didn't have time
to finish his breakfast.

341
00:21:55,771 --> 00:21:58,149
He'd already eaten.
Gets up early.

342
00:21:59,358 --> 00:22:02,695
- You went to Mellen's last night.
- Take this away, please. Yes, I did.

343
00:22:02,778 --> 00:22:06,490
- How is he?
- I'd like a Vitelle water.

344
00:22:06,574 --> 00:22:08,576
He's fine.

345
00:22:08,659 --> 00:22:10,911
You left early. Why?

346
00:22:10,953 --> 00:22:14,790
We had to work
on the museum party.

347
00:22:14,874 --> 00:22:17,668
I will not work for Larry Levy.

348
00:22:17,752 --> 00:22:20,087
I'm not asking you to.

349
00:22:21,338 --> 00:22:24,675
I report to you. If I have to report
to Larry Levy, I quit.

350
00:22:27,011 --> 00:22:30,514
You can't quit.
I won't let you quit.

351
00:22:30,598 --> 00:22:33,267
You have a year and a half on your
contract. I'll sue you for breach...

352
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:36,687
if you don't show up in the office
every day, with a smile.

353
00:22:38,022 --> 00:22:40,274
Why Levy?

354
00:22:40,357 --> 00:22:42,776
Levy was available.

355
00:22:42,818 --> 00:22:45,279
He's good on material,
you're good with writers.

356
00:22:45,321 --> 00:22:47,948
We're a team. He's a new member
of the team, that's all.

357
00:22:49,116 --> 00:22:51,285
He can make us all look good.

358
00:22:51,327 --> 00:22:54,330
This is a wine glass. Can I have
my water in a water glass, please?

359
00:22:55,664 --> 00:22:57,166
Well?

360
00:22:57,249 --> 00:23:00,294
I'll have to think about it.

361
00:23:00,377 --> 00:23:02,296
I want an answer this afternoon.

362
00:23:02,338 --> 00:23:05,049
I have to go out to Palmdale.

363
00:23:05,132 --> 00:23:08,052
The director of Lonely Room
is giving Lily a hard time.

364
00:23:09,345 --> 00:23:13,057
- I'll be back around 5:00.
- So call after 5:00.

365
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:15,476
I'll get back to you.

366
00:23:15,559 --> 00:23:19,605
...you haven't died.
See, he's still hanging on.

367
00:23:32,201 --> 00:23:35,496
Griffin, Joel Levison on line 2.
I'll put it through.

368
00:23:35,579 --> 00:23:38,332
- I'll get back to him.
- Tell Joel you'll get back to him?

369
00:23:38,374 --> 00:23:41,961
Yeah. I want to hear
what he's got to say.

370
00:23:51,595 --> 00:23:54,723
- How did this get here?
- The mail.

371
00:23:54,807 --> 00:23:57,685
But this does not have a postmark.
This was hand-delivered.

372
00:23:57,768 --> 00:23:59,812
Not to me.
It came with the mail.

373
00:23:59,895 --> 00:24:01,355
Jimmy?

374
00:24:03,816 --> 00:24:06,860
Do you know anything about this?
Who delivered it? Where it came from?

375
00:24:06,944 --> 00:24:09,321
Mail room?

376
00:24:09,405 --> 00:24:12,074
But I want to know how it got
to the goddamn mail room.

377
00:24:12,157 --> 00:24:14,868
- Find out and get back to me.
- Okay, sure.

378
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:18,747
- You go with him.
- You want me to go to the mail room?

379
00:24:18,831 --> 00:24:21,041
I want you to go to the mail room.
And while you're there...

380
00:24:21,083 --> 00:24:24,503
I would like a copy of
The Lonely Room rewrites...

381
00:24:24,586 --> 00:24:27,256
in white pages,
no color.

382
00:24:27,339 --> 00:24:29,842
- Find out how this got in my mail.
- Yes, sir.

383
00:24:29,925 --> 00:24:33,887
- You'll get your own phones?
- I can get my own phones.

384
00:24:40,602 --> 00:24:42,771
Son of a bitch!
Five months.

385
00:24:42,855 --> 00:24:46,275
One, two, three, four, five.

386
00:24:49,278 --> 00:24:52,031
Richard Fueller.
David Lucas.

387
00:24:55,325 --> 00:24:59,246
Cal Winstrom. David Kahane.
Sammy Tettleton.

388
00:25:05,127 --> 00:25:06,587
Incoming.

389
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:13,844
Incoming. Unreturned calls.

390
00:25:13,927 --> 00:25:15,471
Bill Lyndstrom.

391
00:25:16,722 --> 00:25:19,099
Nancy Franklin.
Wouldn't be a woman.

392
00:25:19,183 --> 00:25:21,101
David Kahane.

393
00:25:33,822 --> 00:25:35,449
Lyndstrom.

394
00:25:37,659 --> 00:25:40,078
Strategic Planning.
Wouldn't be him.

395
00:25:40,162 --> 00:25:43,624
What was that other guy's name?

396
00:25:43,707 --> 00:25:45,125
Kahane.

397
00:25:47,419 --> 00:25:51,131
Kaltrime. Kahane.

398
00:25:51,215 --> 00:25:53,175
'Unproduced.'
Gotcha!

399
00:26:50,649 --> 00:26:53,819
- Hello.
- Hello. Is David Kahane there?

400
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:55,320
David!

401
00:27:03,203 --> 00:27:07,165
I'm sorry. I forgot.
He's gone out. Who's this?

402
00:27:07,249 --> 00:27:10,294
- This is Griffin Mill.
- Oh, the dead man.

403
00:27:10,377 --> 00:27:13,922
- What did you say?
- Oh, nothing.

404
00:27:14,006 --> 00:27:19,636
- About me being a dead man?
- Just a nickname David has for you.

405
00:27:19,678 --> 00:27:23,473
I see.
That's a funny nickname.

406
00:27:23,515 --> 00:27:27,477
I suppose your husband doesn't like me
very much.

407
00:27:27,519 --> 00:27:29,730
I don't have a husband.

408
00:27:29,813 --> 00:27:31,940
I suppose David doesn't like me
very much.

409
00:27:32,024 --> 00:27:34,234
David's gone to the cinema.

410
00:27:34,318 --> 00:27:38,530
- When will he be back?
- When the film's over, I presume.

411
00:27:38,613 --> 00:27:41,325
And you are?

412
00:27:41,408 --> 00:27:44,119
- June.
- June?

413
00:27:44,202 --> 00:27:46,455
Here we go.
You want to know my last name.

414
00:27:46,538 --> 00:27:50,459
- No one can pronounce it.
- Try me.

415
00:27:50,542 --> 00:27:52,002
Gudmundsdottir.

416
00:27:52,185 --> 00:27:53,837
Gudmundsdottir.

417
00:27:57,174 --> 00:27:59,843
- How's that?
- Very good.

418
00:27:59,885 --> 00:28:01,344
Thanks.

419
00:28:02,637 --> 00:28:06,433
- What do people usually say?
- Don't ask.

420
00:28:06,516 --> 00:28:11,563
Anything from Good Dog's Water
to Goulash Wallop.

421
00:28:13,482 --> 00:28:15,817
- You English?
- Yep.

422
00:28:15,901 --> 00:28:18,236
Well, no, not really.

423
00:28:18,278 --> 00:28:21,156
Where are you sort of not from?

424
00:28:21,239 --> 00:28:25,202
Do you want the long story
or the short one?

425
00:28:25,285 --> 00:28:27,412
- The long one.
- No, you'd never believe it.

426
00:28:27,454 --> 00:28:31,416
- The short one's Iceland.
- Iceland?

427
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:35,003
I didn't know anyone came from Iceland.
I thought it was just a block of ice.

428
00:28:35,087 --> 00:28:37,422
It's very green, actually.

429
00:28:37,506 --> 00:28:40,175
Really? I thought that was Greenland.

430
00:28:40,258 --> 00:28:44,846
No, Greenland's very icy.
Iceland's very green.

431
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:48,391
They switched names to fool the Vikings
who tried to steal their women.

432
00:28:48,475 --> 00:28:49,893
I see.

433
00:28:49,935 --> 00:28:52,896
No. Blue sea.

434
00:28:52,938 --> 00:28:54,940
Red sea.

435
00:28:54,981 --> 00:28:58,235
- No red.
- You're a painter.

436
00:28:58,318 --> 00:29:00,278
How did you guess?

437
00:29:01,863 --> 00:29:04,324
What movie did David go to see?

438
00:29:04,407 --> 00:29:08,286
He went to the Rialto in Pasadena.
He always goes there.

439
00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:10,288
What's showing?

440
00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:14,334
Bicycle Thief, I think.

441
00:29:14,417 --> 00:29:16,837
It's a good movie.
Have you seen it?

442
00:29:18,088 --> 00:29:20,382
I don't go to the movies.

443
00:29:20,465 --> 00:29:21,883
Why not?

444
00:29:29,766 --> 00:29:32,102
Life is too short.

445
00:29:32,143 --> 00:29:34,688
I've got to hang up now.

446
00:30:59,773 --> 00:31:01,733
David Kahane!

447
00:31:01,775 --> 00:31:04,361
You have the wrong guy, man.

448
00:31:25,423 --> 00:31:28,218
David Kahane.
Griffin Mill.

449
00:31:29,803 --> 00:31:31,971
Griffin Mill.

450
00:31:32,055 --> 00:31:33,556
Yeah?

451
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,850
Great movie, huh?

452
00:31:35,934 --> 00:31:39,813
It's refreshing to see something like
this after all these cop movies...

453
00:31:39,896 --> 00:31:44,400
and, you know,
things we do.

454
00:31:44,484 --> 00:31:47,570
- Maybe we'll do a remake of this.
- You'd probably give it a happy ending.

455
00:31:47,654 --> 00:31:49,656
No, we'd keep it pure.

456
00:31:49,739 --> 00:31:51,658
Pure, right.

457
00:31:51,741 --> 00:31:55,245
- You want to write it?
- Don't fuck with me.

458
00:31:55,328 --> 00:31:57,914
I'm not fucking with you.
Didn't I say I'd get back to you?

459
00:31:57,956 --> 00:32:01,459
Yeah, about six months ago.
I thought you'd forgotten.

460
00:32:01,543 --> 00:32:04,254
You were angry.

461
00:32:04,295 --> 00:32:05,755
Maybe.

462
00:32:05,797 --> 00:32:08,133
Do you want to talk about it?

463
00:32:08,216 --> 00:32:10,760
- Okay, sure.
- Great.

464
00:32:10,802 --> 00:32:14,097
Let's let the studio
buy us a drink.

465
00:32:16,516 --> 00:32:20,478
If you don't mind a place where you
don't have any suck with the maitre d'.

466
00:32:20,562 --> 00:32:23,147
- I know a bar down the street.
- Let's go.

467
00:32:30,697 --> 00:32:33,283
Have you ever been to Japan?

468
00:32:33,324 --> 00:32:37,537
Yes. I was there once on
a location scout with Steven Spielberg.

469
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:40,039
I lived there for a year.

470
00:32:40,123 --> 00:32:42,292
Student year abroad.

471
00:32:42,333 --> 00:32:45,169
I wish I'd done that.

472
00:32:45,253 --> 00:32:48,590
I think about it a lot.
I'll never forget it.

473
00:32:48,673 --> 00:32:51,175
You should write about it.

474
00:32:51,259 --> 00:32:53,803
I did.
Don't you remember?

475
00:32:55,013 --> 00:32:56,472
What?

476
00:32:58,766 --> 00:33:03,896
My idea about the American student
who goes to Japan.

477
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:07,150
That was my pitch, the one you were
supposed to get back to me on.

478
00:33:07,191 --> 00:33:10,069
- You don't remember, do you?
- Of course I remember.

479
00:33:12,530 --> 00:33:15,158
You never got back to me.

480
00:33:15,199 --> 00:33:17,285
Listen.

481
00:33:17,368 --> 00:33:22,498
I was an asshole, all right?
It comes with the job.

482
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:24,667
I'm really sorry.

483
00:33:26,961 --> 00:33:30,173
I know how angry you must've been.
I'll make it up to you.

484
00:33:30,214 --> 00:33:31,841
That's why I'm here.

485
00:33:31,883 --> 00:33:35,428
I'm gonna give you a deal, David.

486
00:33:35,511 --> 00:33:39,223
I won't guarantee you I'll make
the movie, but I will give you a shot.

487
00:33:43,061 --> 00:33:47,899
Let's just stop all the postcard shit,
all right?

488
00:33:47,982 --> 00:33:50,777
I'm here to say
that I would like...

489
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:52,779
to start over.

490
00:33:54,405 --> 00:33:55,865
Friends.

491
00:33:57,617 --> 00:34:00,370
Fuck you, man.
You're a liar.

492
00:34:00,411 --> 00:34:02,413
You're stepping over the line.

493
00:34:02,497 --> 00:34:04,749
You didn't come here
to see The Bicycle Thief.

494
00:34:04,791 --> 00:34:07,919
You came in five minutes
before the picture ended.

495
00:34:08,002 --> 00:34:10,421
Nearly tripped over my feet.

496
00:34:11,798 --> 00:34:13,758
Did you call my house?

497
00:34:15,718 --> 00:34:17,595
Speak to the Ice Queen?

498
00:34:19,305 --> 00:34:22,600
You'd like her.
She's a lot like you.

499
00:34:22,642 --> 00:34:24,102
All heart.

500
00:34:30,233 --> 00:34:34,445
You're on my list, pal.
Nothing's gonna change that.

501
00:34:38,282 --> 00:34:41,911
See you in the next reel, asshole.

502
00:35:29,792 --> 00:35:33,713
It's a nice boat you got there,
movie exec.

503
00:35:33,796 --> 00:35:37,091
It's me, the writer.
Still want to buy my story?

504
00:35:37,175 --> 00:35:40,678
I told you I'd deal. Stop by the studio.
We'll work something out.

505
00:35:40,761 --> 00:35:43,681
And who will I ask for?

506
00:35:43,723 --> 00:35:45,182
Larry Levy?

507
00:35:47,184 --> 00:35:49,145
What's Larry Levy got to do with this?

508
00:35:50,229 --> 00:35:52,523
- How do you know about Larry Levy?
- Don't you read the trades?

509
00:35:52,607 --> 00:35:55,818
New York Times business section?
He's movin' in, you're movin' out.

510
00:35:55,902 --> 00:35:58,613
You can't make a deal, they say.
Yesterday's news.

511
00:35:58,696 --> 00:36:00,615
Wait a minute.

512
00:36:02,074 --> 00:36:04,535
Can I borrow your mobile phone?

513
00:36:04,619 --> 00:36:08,205
Larry Levy.
Larry, David Kahane here.

514
00:36:08,247 --> 00:36:12,209
Guess who's making promises
about getting pictures made...

515
00:36:12,251 --> 00:36:14,879
to writers in parking lots?

516
00:36:14,921 --> 00:36:17,965
Guess what dumb
son of a bitch executive...

517
00:36:18,049 --> 00:36:22,136
is trying to take advantage of me?

518
00:36:22,219 --> 00:36:25,973
Do you realize how unstoppable
this guy is?

519
00:36:26,057 --> 00:36:28,392
You know,
I cannot wait...

520
00:36:28,434 --> 00:36:33,481
to tell the world that when Griffin Mill
can't cut the pressure at work...

521
00:36:33,564 --> 00:36:36,567
he drives out to Pasadena...

522
00:36:36,651 --> 00:36:39,570
to pick fights with writers.

523
00:36:40,905 --> 00:36:42,907
Tell Larry Levy to call me.

524
00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:48,454
The word is out that he's going to start
making meaningful pictures for a change.

525
00:36:48,496 --> 00:36:51,666
Let's forget this.
Just stop all the postcard shit!

526
00:36:51,749 --> 00:36:53,959
I don't write postcards!
I write scripts!

527
00:36:54,043 --> 00:36:57,254
- We're both wrong.
- No, you're wrong, buddy!

528
00:36:57,338 --> 00:37:00,007
You're in over your head.
That's why you're losing your job.

529
00:37:00,091 --> 00:37:02,218
Then what are you gonna do?

530
00:37:03,344 --> 00:37:05,721
I can write.
What can you do?

531
00:37:10,476 --> 00:37:12,728
I said, let's forget this.

532
00:37:17,483 --> 00:37:19,443
Ah, shit.

533
00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:23,781
Mill, you okay?

534
00:37:32,206 --> 00:37:34,942
Keep it to yourself!

535
00:37:35,126 --> 00:37:37,711
Keep it to yourself!

536
00:38:03,362 --> 00:38:04,822
Kahane?

537
00:39:25,945 --> 00:39:29,740
That's interesting.
Who's writing this movie?

538
00:39:29,782 --> 00:39:33,327
Who wrote the new ending
to Fatal Attraction? The audience.

539
00:39:33,410 --> 00:39:36,372
A million screenwriters
from the audience wrote that.

540
00:39:36,455 --> 00:39:40,292
Who's to say what it would have done
if you had left the original ending?

541
00:39:40,376 --> 00:39:44,296
You're right, but you can say that it's
done almost 300 million worldwide...

542
00:39:44,338 --> 00:39:46,674
with the new ending.

543
00:39:46,799 --> 00:39:50,427
Larry Levy, I don't believe you've met
my assistant, Whitney Gersh.

544
00:39:50,511 --> 00:39:53,097
- No, I haven't.
- It's a pleasure to meet you.

545
00:39:55,265 --> 00:39:57,935
How's your picture?
It just tested last week.

546
00:39:57,977 --> 00:40:01,605
It's doing well.
It was our first test.

547
00:40:01,689 --> 00:40:03,607
Excuse me, Walter.

548
00:40:03,649 --> 00:40:08,070
Joel, Griffin isn't in, but I think
we really have to start this meeting.

549
00:40:08,153 --> 00:40:10,406
Okay, Celia. Thank you.

550
00:40:13,117 --> 00:40:15,327
Remember a movie called D.O.A.?

551
00:40:15,411 --> 00:40:17,621
Sure I do.
Eddie O'Brien and Pam Britton.

552
00:40:17,663 --> 00:40:21,166
Disney did a remake in '87 or '88.

553
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:24,086
I think we've got
pretty much the same situation here.

554
00:40:24,169 --> 00:40:26,630
Keep our noses clean, Walter.

555
00:40:30,092 --> 00:40:32,594
It's a shame to waste a picture.

556
00:40:32,678 --> 00:40:36,890
Who said we're wasting the picture?
Where did that come from?

557
00:40:36,974 --> 00:40:39,768
You know what's interesting?
We're all too busy-

558
00:40:39,852 --> 00:40:44,690
Griffin, you're really late.
They're waiting inside.

559
00:40:44,773 --> 00:40:48,193
To actually rub shoulders
with the great unwashed?

560
00:40:48,277 --> 00:40:51,530
We need to give them
the kind of pictures they want...

561
00:40:51,613 --> 00:40:53,740
not the kind
writers want to give them.

562
00:41:01,081 --> 00:41:04,084
- Hello. Sorry I'm late.
- You certainly are.

563
00:41:08,088 --> 00:41:10,340
A few minutes in the office
would be fine.

564
00:41:11,216 --> 00:41:13,635
Griffin, you missed
the formal welcoming ceremony.

565
00:41:13,719 --> 00:41:16,680
You know Larry Levy.

566
00:41:16,763 --> 00:41:18,807
Of course. Hi, Larry.

567
00:41:20,225 --> 00:41:21,643
Hi, Griffin.

568
00:41:21,727 --> 00:41:23,645
Larry was able to leave Fox
a week earlier than he thought...

569
00:41:23,729 --> 00:41:25,856
and has come aboard
as of this morning.

570
00:41:25,898 --> 00:41:30,986
- Great. Let's start.
- Larry was in the middle of something.

571
00:41:31,069 --> 00:41:34,656
No, I wasn't. I was just killing time
waiting for Griffin.

572
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:37,743
No, finish.
What were you saying?

573
00:41:37,826 --> 00:41:42,247
I was saying I've yet to meet a writer
who could change water into wine...

574
00:41:42,331 --> 00:41:44,833
and we have a tendency
to treat them like that.

575
00:41:45,918 --> 00:41:48,170
Not at this studio.

576
00:41:48,253 --> 00:41:52,174
A million and a half of these scripts.
It's nuts.

577
00:41:52,257 --> 00:41:54,551
And I think avoidable.

578
00:41:54,635 --> 00:41:58,639
Let me ask you. When was the last time
you bought a ticket to see a movie?

579
00:41:58,722 --> 00:42:02,643
- You actually paid your own money?
- Last night.

580
00:42:02,726 --> 00:42:04,895
Pasadena. The Bicycle Thief.

581
00:42:04,978 --> 00:42:08,190
- You saw The Bicycle Thief?
- I love that. It's a great film.

582
00:42:08,273 --> 00:42:11,068
It's an art movie. It doesn't count.
We're talking about movie movies.

583
00:42:11,109 --> 00:42:13,070
Jesus, people.

584
00:42:13,111 --> 00:42:16,031
I'm just saying there's time
and money to be saved...

585
00:42:16,114 --> 00:42:18,825
if we came up with these stories
on our own.

586
00:42:18,909 --> 00:42:21,912
- Where are these stories coming from?
- Anywhere. It doesn't matter.

587
00:42:23,497 --> 00:42:26,375
The newspaper.
Pick any story.

588
00:42:29,628 --> 00:42:32,673
'Immigrants protest budget cuts
in literacy program.'

589
00:42:32,756 --> 00:42:36,218
Human spirit overcoming human adversity.
Sounds like Horatio Alger in the barrio.

590
00:42:36,301 --> 00:42:39,262
Put Jimmy Smits in it and you've got
a sexy Stand and Deliver.

591
00:42:39,346 --> 00:42:42,724
- Next. Come on.
- This isn't my field.

592
00:42:42,808 --> 00:42:45,519
It doesn't matter. Give it a shot.
You can't lose here.

593
00:42:48,522 --> 00:42:52,818
How about 'Mud slide kills 60
in slums of Chili'?

594
00:42:52,901 --> 00:42:56,279
That's good. Triumph over tragedy.
Sounds like a John Boorman picture.

595
00:42:56,363 --> 00:42:59,616
Slap a happy ending on it,
the script will write itself.

596
00:42:59,658 --> 00:43:03,286
- Bonnie. Give me the paper.
- I don't know, Larry.

597
00:43:03,328 --> 00:43:05,288
Give it a shot.

598
00:43:06,999 --> 00:43:10,377
'Further bond losses
push Dow down 7.15.'

599
00:43:11,294 --> 00:43:14,047
- I see Connery as Bond.
- That's funny.

600
00:43:14,131 --> 00:43:17,801
It's a good thing Oliver Stone wasn't
listening to you. Where would we be?

601
00:43:17,843 --> 00:43:22,139
We would have been spared
sitting through Wall Street.

602
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:25,851
- What did Wall Street do worldwide?
- 70, 75, maybe 80.

603
00:43:25,934 --> 00:43:29,146
$80 million,
a couple Oscars.

604
00:43:29,229 --> 00:43:33,275
I think Larry's point is well taken.
Let's move on.

605
00:43:33,358 --> 00:43:36,820
Can you give us an update
on the Taylor-Hackford project?

606
00:43:36,903 --> 00:43:38,905
Griffin?

607
00:43:38,989 --> 00:43:40,407
Yeah.

608
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:44,244
I was thinking what
an interesting concept it is...

609
00:43:44,327 --> 00:43:48,623
to eliminate the writer
from the artistic process.

610
00:43:49,541 --> 00:43:54,463
If we can get rid of the actors and
directors, maybe we've got something.

611
00:43:59,885 --> 00:44:01,303
Hello, Walter.

612
00:44:01,386 --> 00:44:03,680
Make yourself at home.

613
00:44:03,764 --> 00:44:07,476
Mr. Mill, I understand you were late
coming in this morning.

614
00:44:07,559 --> 00:44:09,811
You all right?

615
00:44:09,853 --> 00:44:11,480
I'm fine.

616
00:44:11,563 --> 00:44:13,690
I appreciate your concern.

617
00:44:15,108 --> 00:44:17,486
What can I do for you?

618
00:44:17,569 --> 00:44:21,281
Don't tell me you came here
to pitch me a story?

619
00:44:21,323 --> 00:44:23,742
That's exactly what I've come to do.

620
00:44:23,825 --> 00:44:26,870
It's a good one, too.
It's about a writer, sort of.

621
00:44:26,953 --> 00:44:28,371
David Kahane.

622
00:44:31,249 --> 00:44:33,668
Who's David Kahane?

623
00:44:33,710 --> 00:44:37,297
- You met him.
- I meet a lot of writers.

624
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:42,969
But this writer was murdered last night
in back of the Rialto Theater.

625
00:44:43,011 --> 00:44:44,513
Murdered?

626
00:44:44,596 --> 00:44:48,642
Come to think of it, Pasadena's
as good a place to die as any.

627
00:44:50,018 --> 00:44:51,978
What's the story?

628
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:56,107
In 25 words or less?
Okay.

629
00:44:56,191 --> 00:44:59,027
Movie exec calls writer.
Girlfriend says he's at the movies.

630
00:44:59,069 --> 00:45:02,405
Exec goes to movies, meets writer,
drinks with writer.

631
00:45:02,489 --> 00:45:06,034
Writer gets conked and dies
in 4 inches of dirty water.

632
00:45:06,117 --> 00:45:08,411
Movie exec is in deep shit.

633
00:45:09,538 --> 00:45:11,539
What do you think?

634
00:45:11,581 --> 00:45:15,085
That's more than 25 words.
And it's bullshit.

635
00:45:15,168 --> 00:45:19,047
Pasadena homicide doesn't think so.
They've got a complete report.

636
00:45:20,090 --> 00:45:24,386
You met Kahane at the Rialto,
got drunk with him. He left before you.

637
00:45:24,427 --> 00:45:27,722
That's the last time anyone
saw him alive, except you, maybe.

638
00:45:28,932 --> 00:45:31,768
Why are you denying this?

639
00:45:31,851 --> 00:45:35,230
Well, what do the police think?

640
00:45:35,313 --> 00:45:38,066
They think it's a botched robbery.

641
00:45:39,901 --> 00:45:44,864
The window of his car was busted.
He surprised someone taking the radio.

642
00:45:44,948 --> 00:45:47,242
There was a fight, he was killed.

643
00:45:47,284 --> 00:45:50,245
I didn't kill him, Walter.

644
00:45:50,328 --> 00:45:54,874
But I went to see him.
I know I said I didn't, but I did.

645
00:45:54,958 --> 00:45:57,043
Why'd you lie to me?

646
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:01,256
Now's not a very good time for me.

647
00:46:01,339 --> 00:46:04,884
Haven't you heard the rumors?
I'm on my way out.

648
00:46:04,926 --> 00:46:07,429
Just what I need,
a little more controversy.

649
00:46:07,512 --> 00:46:09,431
It's not a good time.

650
00:46:10,849 --> 00:46:13,143
Look.

651
00:46:13,226 --> 00:46:16,813
I'm in charge of studio security
in every definition of the word.

652
00:46:16,896 --> 00:46:22,444
Which means it is my job to take care
of a studio executive should he be...

653
00:46:22,527 --> 00:46:25,780
under suspicion of murder
at a time when profits are down...

654
00:46:25,864 --> 00:46:28,283
and the company is vulnerable
for a takeover.

655
00:46:28,324 --> 00:46:31,494
It is my job to keep this
very, very quiet!

656
00:46:32,912 --> 00:46:34,998
Do you want to help?

657
00:46:35,081 --> 00:46:37,959
- Of course.
- Then stop lying.

658
00:46:38,001 --> 00:46:40,587
- How many times did you meet with him?
- Once.

659
00:46:41,796 --> 00:46:44,340
- Not counting last night.
- Not counting last night.

660
00:46:44,424 --> 00:46:46,676
Why'd you go all the way to Pasadena
to meet him?

661
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:49,679
He had an idea I was interested in.
I wanted to talk to him right away.

662
00:46:49,763 --> 00:46:54,559
Was his girlfriend a friend, too?
Think fast.

663
00:46:54,642 --> 00:46:57,270
Jesus Christ, Walter.
What is this?

664
00:46:57,312 --> 00:47:00,482
The third degree. Wait until the police
start asking questions.

665
00:47:00,565 --> 00:47:04,027
I'll go to the police now.
You come with me.

666
00:47:04,110 --> 00:47:06,446
You're acting like someone
who's guilty.

667
00:47:06,488 --> 00:47:08,490
You're not guilty, are you?

668
00:47:08,531 --> 00:47:10,784
I'm not a murderer.

669
00:47:28,009 --> 00:47:30,011
Bad news?

670
00:47:30,094 --> 00:47:31,513
What?

671
00:47:31,596 --> 00:47:34,516
The fax.
Is it bad news?

672
00:47:36,976 --> 00:47:38,561
Business as usual.

673
00:47:40,230 --> 00:47:44,025
The Hollywood system
did not murder David Kahane.

674
00:47:44,067 --> 00:47:47,237
Not the $98 million movie,
not the $12 million actor.

675
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:52,951
Not even the million dollar deal
that David Kahane never landed.

676
00:47:53,034 --> 00:47:56,120
The most that we can pin on Hollywood...

677
00:47:56,204 --> 00:47:59,666
is assault with intent to kill.

678
00:47:59,707 --> 00:48:04,546
Because society is responsible
for this particular murder.

679
00:48:04,587 --> 00:48:06,714
It is to society we must look...

680
00:48:06,798 --> 00:48:10,552
if we are to have justice
for that crime.

681
00:48:10,593 --> 00:48:13,346
Because someone in the night...

682
00:48:13,388 --> 00:48:15,598
killed David Kahane.

683
00:48:15,682 --> 00:48:18,101
And that person
will have to bear the guilt.

684
00:48:19,644 --> 00:48:22,063
And if David were here now...

685
00:48:22,105 --> 00:48:24,649
I know in my heart
that he would say...

686
00:48:26,067 --> 00:48:28,987
'Cut the shit, Phil.

687
00:48:29,070 --> 00:48:33,032
What did you learn from this?
Did you learn anything from this?(

688
00:48:33,074 --> 00:48:36,202
And I'd say, 'Yeah, David,
I've learned a lot.

689
00:48:36,244 --> 00:48:39,205
We here will take it from here.

690
00:48:39,247 --> 00:48:43,584
And the next time we sell a script
for a million dollars...

691
00:48:43,626 --> 00:48:46,963
and nail some shit-bag producer
to the wall, we'll say...

692
00:48:47,046 --> 00:48:49,507
That's another one for David Kahane.(

693
00:48:53,136 --> 00:48:57,015
David was working on something the day
he died. I'd like to share it with you.

694
00:48:58,391 --> 00:49:01,394
'Blackness.
A mangy dog barks.

695
00:49:01,436 --> 00:49:04,772
Garbage can lids are lifted
as derelicts in the street...

696
00:49:04,814 --> 00:49:07,275
hunt for food.

697
00:49:07,358 --> 00:49:09,777
Buzzing, as a cheap alarm clock
goes off.

698
00:49:09,861 --> 00:49:13,573
Interior. Flophouse room.
Early morning.

699
00:49:13,614 --> 00:49:16,743
A tracking shot moves
through the grimy room.

700
00:49:16,826 --> 00:49:20,413
Light streams in through holes
in yellowing window shades.

701
00:49:20,496 --> 00:49:23,166
Moths dance
in the beams of light.

702
00:49:23,249 --> 00:49:26,586
Track down along the floor.
The frayed rug.

703
00:49:26,627 --> 00:49:29,589
Stop on an old shoe.

704
00:49:29,630 --> 00:49:31,341
It's empty.

705
00:49:35,595 --> 00:49:37,680
That's as far as he got.

706
00:49:39,057 --> 00:49:41,517
That's the last thing he wrote.

707
00:49:42,393 --> 00:49:44,604
So long, Dave.

708
00:49:44,645 --> 00:49:46,856
Fade out.

709
00:49:46,939 --> 00:49:48,357
Thank you.

710
00:50:04,665 --> 00:50:07,168
Who are you?
You're not a writer.

711
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:11,255
No, I'm Griffin Mill.

712
00:50:11,339 --> 00:50:13,257
We spoke the night David-

713
00:50:13,341 --> 00:50:16,177
Blue sea, white sea.
Yes.

714
00:50:16,219 --> 00:50:18,513
- It turned out you were right.
- What?

715
00:50:18,596 --> 00:50:21,015
It was a red sea.

716
00:50:21,099 --> 00:50:22,850
Oh, yeah.

717
00:50:25,311 --> 00:50:28,481
You're the only person I know here.

718
00:50:28,523 --> 00:50:31,400
I'm really sorry about David.

719
00:50:31,484 --> 00:50:34,570
He was a talent.

720
00:50:35,738 --> 00:50:37,949
You really think so?

721
00:50:38,032 --> 00:50:41,285
I always suspected he was...

722
00:50:41,369 --> 00:50:43,996
uniquely untalented.

723
00:50:45,540 --> 00:50:48,709
It's nice of you to say that. It was
nice of you to come. You didn't have to.

724
00:50:48,793 --> 00:50:50,211
I did.

725
00:50:50,294 --> 00:50:54,841
You know, I was probably the last person
to see him alive.

726
00:50:54,882 --> 00:50:57,218
The police told me.

727
00:50:57,260 --> 00:50:59,387
Not quite the last, surely.

728
00:51:02,557 --> 00:51:05,768
I'm sure this is a terrible time
for you.

729
00:51:05,852 --> 00:51:08,187
Is there anything you need?

730
00:51:08,229 --> 00:51:12,942
No, really.
I don't feel bad.

731
00:51:13,025 --> 00:51:15,903
It's like when my parents died.

732
00:51:15,945 --> 00:51:19,490
I didn't feel anything at all.
They were just gone.

733
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:24,412
I'm sure it hasn't sunk in yet.

734
00:51:24,495 --> 00:51:26,247
That was years ago.

735
00:51:26,289 --> 00:51:29,083
No, I meant David.

736
00:51:29,125 --> 00:51:31,002
Oh, God.

737
00:51:31,085 --> 00:51:34,088
These people.
I don't like it here.

738
00:51:34,171 --> 00:51:37,758
They're all expecting me
to grieve and mourn.

739
00:51:37,842 --> 00:51:40,136
I can't talk to them.

740
00:51:41,887 --> 00:51:47,018
David's gone and
I'm somewhere else already.

741
00:51:47,101 --> 00:51:49,937
- Will you take me home?
- What?

742
00:51:49,979 --> 00:51:52,732
Will you take me home?

743
00:51:52,773 --> 00:51:55,568
Sure. I'm right here.

744
00:52:32,563 --> 00:52:35,191
These are very interesting.
I like them.

745
00:52:35,274 --> 00:52:38,903
- Would you like a drink?
- No, thanks.

746
00:52:38,986 --> 00:52:42,907
Where do you show?
What gallery? Who's your dealer?

747
00:52:42,990 --> 00:52:45,409
I don't have a dealer.

748
00:52:45,493 --> 00:52:48,454
I couldn't sell these.
They're never finished. Biccy?

749
00:52:50,039 --> 00:52:53,000
No, thanks.
They're never finished?

750
00:52:53,084 --> 00:52:57,546
No, they're just what I do
for myself.

751
00:52:57,588 --> 00:53:00,132
What I feel.

752
00:53:00,216 --> 00:53:02,885
You ask lots of questions, Mr. Mill.

753
00:53:02,968 --> 00:53:06,722
Just like the police.
That's all they did, ask questions.

754
00:53:08,432 --> 00:53:10,351
They asked me a lot about you.

755
00:53:10,434 --> 00:53:12,144
Did they?

756
00:53:12,228 --> 00:53:14,146
How long we'd known each other.

757
00:53:14,230 --> 00:53:16,232
If you'd ever been
to the house before.

758
00:53:16,315 --> 00:53:21,153
- They have to ask those questions.
- I don't see why.

759
00:53:21,237 --> 00:53:23,489
Because that's what police do.

760
00:53:24,532 --> 00:53:27,701
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

761
00:53:27,785 --> 00:53:30,538
Why was it so important
to see David that night?

762
00:53:30,621 --> 00:53:32,706
What was so urgent?

763
00:53:34,375 --> 00:53:37,253
He pitched me a story
a few months ago.

764
00:53:37,336 --> 00:53:39,630
- The Japan story?
- Yes, the Japan story.

765
00:53:39,713 --> 00:53:43,259
I liked it but it needed work,
especially the ending.

766
00:53:43,342 --> 00:53:46,137
I was sitting in my office...

767
00:53:46,220 --> 00:53:49,181
and it suddenly occurred to me
how to make the ending work.

768
00:53:49,265 --> 00:53:51,392
So what was it?

769
00:53:51,475 --> 00:53:52,893
What?

770
00:53:52,977 --> 00:53:55,938
Your idea for the ending.

771
00:53:56,021 --> 00:53:58,023
Up.

772
00:53:58,107 --> 00:54:00,276
Up? What does that mean?

773
00:54:00,359 --> 00:54:03,112
As opposed to down. Moods.

774
00:54:03,195 --> 00:54:06,365
You know, happy as opposed to sad.
Hopeful as opposed to depressing.

775
00:54:06,448 --> 00:54:10,119
- What did you think of his ending?
- I never read it.

776
00:54:12,037 --> 00:54:14,665
- You never read it?
- Nope.

777
00:54:14,748 --> 00:54:17,167
I don't like reading.

778
00:54:17,251 --> 00:54:22,423
- Do you like books?
- I like words and letters.

779
00:54:22,506 --> 00:54:24,758
But I'm not crazy
about complete sentences.

780
00:54:26,510 --> 00:54:29,013
What did he think?

781
00:54:29,096 --> 00:54:32,850
He walked out on me.
I don't think David liked me.

782
00:54:32,933 --> 00:54:36,854
I think he just didn't like
happy endings.

783
00:54:40,608 --> 00:54:42,776
Put your face here.

784
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:45,738
Great.

785
00:54:47,906 --> 00:54:50,492
What are you doing?
You aren't going to paint me, are you?

786
00:54:50,576 --> 00:54:53,829
I might put you
in one of my paintings.

787
00:54:53,871 --> 00:54:57,541
There's one I want to do
of an Icelandic hero.

788
00:54:57,625 --> 00:55:00,628
He's a thief
and he's made of fire.

789
00:55:00,711 --> 00:55:03,255
- You might not like that.
- Why not?

790
00:55:03,339 --> 00:55:06,050
Because you're in the movies...

791
00:55:06,133 --> 00:55:10,054
and in movies you can't have thieves
as heroes, can you?

792
00:55:10,137 --> 00:55:13,724
I don't know about that. We have a long
tradition of gangsters in movies.

793
00:55:13,807 --> 00:55:17,519
Yes, but they always have to suffer
for their crimes, don't they?

794
00:55:19,104 --> 00:55:21,273
We should pay for our crimes,
shouldn't we?

795
00:55:21,357 --> 00:55:25,694
I think knowing you've committed a crime
is suffering enough.

796
00:55:25,736 --> 00:55:27,738
If you don't suffer...

797
00:55:27,821 --> 00:55:31,533
maybe it wasn't a crime after all.

798
00:55:31,575 --> 00:55:34,119
Anyway, what difference does it make?

799
00:55:34,203 --> 00:55:37,456
It has nothing to do
with how things really are.

800
00:55:41,794 --> 00:55:44,463
Do you really believe that?

801
00:55:44,546 --> 00:55:47,925
I don't know what I believe, Mr. Mill.

802
00:55:48,008 --> 00:55:50,803
It's just what I feel.

803
00:55:52,471 --> 00:55:56,266
You know what you are,
June whatever-your-name-is?

804
00:55:56,350 --> 00:55:58,018
A pragmatic anarchist.

805
00:55:59,478 --> 00:56:01,438
Is that what I am?

806
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:03,607
I never was sure.

807
00:56:08,112 --> 00:56:10,531
Can I just pick this up?

808
00:56:11,782 --> 00:56:14,576
- Oh, it's heavy.
- Thirty-seven ounces.

809
00:56:14,618 --> 00:56:17,121
Really? Look.

810
00:56:17,162 --> 00:56:21,375
I want to thank my mother, her mother
and her father's mother who-

811
00:56:23,377 --> 00:56:24,795
Hello.

812
00:56:26,255 --> 00:56:29,758
- Meet Detective Susan Avery.
- How do you do? My partner.

813
00:56:29,842 --> 00:56:32,928
- Willa Broom.
- My pleasure. Let's go in here.

814
00:56:33,011 --> 00:56:35,848
This is the first real movie studio
Detective Avery's been to.

815
00:56:35,931 --> 00:56:38,934
- Really?
- Aside from the Universal Tour.

816
00:56:39,017 --> 00:56:41,603
I always take my family there
when they come.

817
00:56:41,687 --> 00:56:45,232
I've been there so often,
I feel like I'm ready to direct.

818
00:56:45,315 --> 00:56:49,820
You'd probably do better
than the film grads these days.

819
00:56:49,903 --> 00:56:52,573
I'm sorry I didn't call you
when I heard Kahane was dead.

820
00:56:52,656 --> 00:56:54,324
- Heard or read?
- Read.

821
00:56:54,366 --> 00:56:57,828
- Why didn't you?
- Walter asked me the same question.

822
00:56:57,911 --> 00:57:01,957
I wish I had a better answer. All
I can say is I didn't think about it.

823
00:57:04,459 --> 00:57:06,545
How did you know where
he was gonna be?

824
00:57:06,628 --> 00:57:09,965
- His wife told me-
- Girlfriend.

825
00:57:10,966 --> 00:57:12,384
Girlfriend.

826
00:57:12,467 --> 00:57:14,678
Girlfriend.
I didn't know either of them.

827
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:17,097
I was restless,
thought I'd see the movie.

828
00:57:17,181 --> 00:57:20,559
If he was there, I'd talk to him
about a job I thought he was good for.

829
00:57:20,642 --> 00:57:22,811
You got to the theater,
saw him and?

830
00:57:22,853 --> 00:57:25,522
We had a drink at a Japanese place.

831
00:57:25,606 --> 00:57:29,484
It was a wild, incredible scene.
It was like Tokyo.

832
00:57:29,568 --> 00:57:32,404
He left before you.
Why didn't you leave together?

833
00:57:32,487 --> 00:57:35,115
It was an incredible scene.
I was having a great time.

834
00:57:35,198 --> 00:57:37,034
Why didn't you stay longer?

835
00:57:37,117 --> 00:57:41,330
People stopped singing. Then it was just
a bar and I don't drink.

836
00:57:41,413 --> 00:57:44,333
- You drank with him.
- When in Rome-

837
00:57:44,416 --> 00:57:48,378
Did you know him socially?
Been to his house?

838
00:57:48,462 --> 00:57:50,505
Know anything about him personally?

839
00:57:52,424 --> 00:57:55,344
We'll let you get back to work now.

840
00:57:57,888 --> 00:57:59,890
What's bothering you?

841
00:57:59,973 --> 00:58:02,851
Well, I just have to ask.

842
00:58:02,893 --> 00:58:06,730
Did you see him in the parking lot
after you left?

843
00:58:06,813 --> 00:58:10,400
No, I parked on the street.
I drive a Range Rover...

844
00:58:10,484 --> 00:58:12,903
so I feel safer
when it's visible.

845
00:58:12,986 --> 00:58:15,614
Who's gonna smash a window
if it's on the street?

846
00:58:15,697 --> 00:58:19,159
If you had a shitty car,
you would've parked in the parking lot?

847
00:58:19,242 --> 00:58:22,120
If I had a shitty car,
I might be a dead man.

848
00:58:22,204 --> 00:58:25,582
Somehow I think you're too lucky
for that.

849
00:58:25,624 --> 00:58:27,501
Thank you.

850
00:58:27,584 --> 00:58:30,379
Okay, 63, take three. Marker.

851
00:58:31,338 --> 00:58:33,757
Now.

852
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:35,509
Action!

853
00:58:36,802 --> 00:58:41,098
No, goddamn it, you listen to me!
I've been around a while. I got a nose.

854
00:58:41,139 --> 00:58:44,935
This situation stinks.
It stinks of the company.

855
00:58:44,976 --> 00:58:48,814
That's right, Peterson,
the fucking CIA. Ever heard of it?

856
00:58:48,897 --> 00:58:51,191
It's the kind of operation-

857
00:58:51,274 --> 00:58:54,361
You don't understand what he's trying
to go for here.

858
00:58:54,444 --> 00:58:57,364
It's hard to listen to your argument
when you don't understand.

859
00:58:57,447 --> 00:59:01,910
- Would you shut up, please?
- Kiss my ass!

860
00:59:01,952 --> 00:59:04,287
I have to cut.
My robe cut on the drawer.

861
00:59:04,371 --> 00:59:08,708
- For Christ's sakes!
- I like this guy. He's great.

862
00:59:08,792 --> 00:59:13,672
Waters?
Can I have some Volvic, please?

863
00:59:13,755 --> 00:59:15,757
Yeah, he's great.

864
00:59:17,175 --> 00:59:20,262
I heard the police came to see you
about this dead writer.

865
00:59:20,303 --> 00:59:23,974
- Who was this guy?
- His name was David Kahane.

866
00:59:24,057 --> 00:59:27,102
I never heard of him.
We ever hire him for anything?

867
00:59:27,144 --> 00:59:30,147
I was thinking about it.

868
00:59:30,188 --> 00:59:33,984
He pitched me a story.
I went there to talk to him about it.

869
00:59:34,085 --> 00:59:39,614
Jesus. Poor bastard. Just when his ship
comes in, some bastard blasts him-

870
00:59:39,698 --> 00:59:42,325
I don't want to criticize you...

871
00:59:42,367 --> 00:59:45,412
but I'm supposed to be talking
on the phone.

872
00:59:45,495 --> 00:59:47,330
Are the cops still bothering you?

873
00:59:47,414 --> 00:59:51,918
- No. No, I don't think so.
- Let Stuckel handle it.

874
00:59:52,002 --> 00:59:56,131
We'll give them passes to a screening.
They can sit behind Michelle Pfeiffer.

875
00:59:56,173 --> 00:59:58,383
They'll leave you alone.

876
00:59:59,676 --> 01:00:03,305
A guy named Joe Gillis called.

877
01:00:03,346 --> 01:00:08,018
He wants you to meet him at the
St. James Club at 10:00 on the patio.

878
01:00:08,101 --> 01:00:12,105
- Never heard of him.
- He said you'd know him.

879
01:00:12,189 --> 01:00:14,149
Anybody know who Joe Gillis is?

880
01:00:14,232 --> 01:00:16,943
He's a character William Holden played
in Sunset Boulevard.

881
01:00:17,027 --> 01:00:21,281
- The writer killed by a movie star.
- Gloria Swanson.

882
01:00:25,744 --> 01:00:29,497
Oh, that guy. Last week he said
he was Charles Foster Kane.

883
01:00:29,539 --> 01:00:32,375
A week before that
it was Rhett Butler.

884
01:00:32,417 --> 01:00:35,754
Why would they think I would kill
my own sister's husband?

885
01:00:37,547 --> 01:00:39,716
I was in love with him.

886
01:01:20,757 --> 01:01:25,512
- Griffin? Griffin.
- Malcolm McDowell, good to see you.

887
01:01:25,595 --> 01:01:29,140
Listen. The next time
you want to badmouth me...

888
01:01:29,224 --> 01:01:31,643
have the courage
to do it to my face.

889
01:01:31,726 --> 01:01:34,187
You guys are all the same.

890
01:01:44,531 --> 01:01:46,825
- You love it there?
- I love it. It's wonderful.

891
01:01:46,908 --> 01:01:49,244
You love your career, don't you?
What is it?

892
01:01:49,327 --> 01:01:53,373
It was a complete disaster.
Look what happened in Heaven's Gate.

893
01:01:53,456 --> 01:01:54,624
We both are concerned...

894
01:01:54,708 --> 01:01:57,043
about your career.

895
01:01:57,127 --> 01:01:59,796
Where I live, I know how people
think and feel.

896
01:02:00,964 --> 01:02:05,176
Montana will end you.
It ended Cimino in Heaven's Gate.

897
01:02:05,260 --> 01:02:09,347
- Griffin Mill, hi. Andy Civella.
- Andy, how are you?

898
01:02:09,431 --> 01:02:13,101
I've got Andie MacDowell sitting over
here. You know her. She's so hot.

899
01:02:13,143 --> 01:02:15,437
- Come over and meet her.
- Still living in New York?

900
01:02:15,478 --> 01:02:18,481
I couldn't live here.
I'm allergic to happiness.

901
01:02:18,565 --> 01:02:22,485
Andie, it's good to see you again.
How are the kids?

902
01:02:22,569 --> 01:02:24,988
Great, thanks.
He's wonderful, thank you.

903
01:02:26,322 --> 01:02:28,700
You geniuses know each other.
Tom Oakley.

904
01:02:28,783 --> 01:02:31,828
- Yes, Hi, Tom.
- How are you?

905
01:02:31,911 --> 01:02:34,998
- Funny. I just saw Malcolm McDowell.
- Really?

906
01:02:35,081 --> 01:02:38,418
Roddy McDowall is related
to a cousin of my brother-in-law.

907
01:02:38,501 --> 01:02:41,171
Well, I'm not related
to either one of them.

908
01:02:51,181 --> 01:02:53,183
If I write it, I direct it.

909
01:02:53,266 --> 01:02:56,686
The last three pictures you directed
were bombs!

910
01:02:56,769 --> 01:03:00,106
Thank you for the drink.
I've got to go.

911
01:03:00,190 --> 01:03:02,150
You've got to go?
