1
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,900
- Here's Mommy.
- Hi, Mom.

2
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,700
Here we go, far away.

3
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:16,400
Oh, my. Gonna miss you.

4
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,600
There you are.

5
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:22,400
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

6
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:25,600
- Take care, Mrs Eberhart. Be happy.
- Thank you, Charlie.

7
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:27,700
Come back and see us.

8
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,100
Bye, kids. See you.

9
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,500
Hey.

10
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,400
Let me take that.

11
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,900
Right.

12
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:23,200
Take care of him, will you?
He's upset.

13
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:27,900
Now, hang on to him tight
so he doesn't jump out the window.

14
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,400
There you are, Mr Eberhart.
We're gonna miss you.

15
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:34,100
- Thanks a lot, have a good trip.
- All right.

16
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,300
- Bye.
- All right, bye.

17
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,900
Terrific job you did up there.

18
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,800
I'm sorry,
I thought I checked everything.

19
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,400
- Yeah.
- Daddy?

20
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:46,500
I just saw a man carrying
a naked lady.

21
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,800
Well, that's why we're moving
to Stepford.

22
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,100
- Come on, Fred.
- Come on, Amy.

23
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:40,400
Come on, Fred.
Come on, Fred.

24
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:42,600
You don't even have to lock
the doors in Stepford.

25
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:46,600
- That's really something, isn't it?
- Yeah.

26
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,900
Mr Eberhart, what's the story
with this piece?

27
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,800
Upstairs, in the main bedroom.

28
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,400
- Upstairs?
- Yeah.

29
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,900
- Terrific.
- Turn around, huh?

30
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,500
This guy's gonna kill us today.

31
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,300
Coffee?

32
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,300
We're not allowed to drink anything
on the job, lady, except beer.

33
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:40,700
Come on, Freddie, you want
a little water here, huh?

34
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,000
Hi.

35
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,100
I'm Carol Van Sant.

36
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:56,300
I just thought this might come
in handy. It's a casserole.

37
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:59,700
That's really very nice of you.

38
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,300
I'm Walter Eberhart.

39
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:08,000
My wife's just inside.
I know she'd like to talk to you.

40
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,800
Oh, no, I know
how much fun moving is.

41
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:14,100
Look, if there's anything else you need,
please call.

42
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,400
I just live over there.

43
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:21,000
Oh, and tell your wife, you keep
that as long as you want.

44
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,100
- Bye now.
- Thank you.

45
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,100
She cooks as good as she looks, Ted.

46
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,200
What do you suppose
the people are like here?

47
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:55,400
Friendly. That was
a good casserole she cooked.

48
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:59,000
- Why did we move?
- We both agreed it was best.

49
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,300
I mean, it's best for the kids.

50
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:06,100
And, well, it's best for you. You know,
I mean, you got more space here.

51
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,800
You can make yourself a darkroom.
It was time to move.

52
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:11,100
You know, I got a terrific deal
on this house.

53
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:17,200
And because it's safe, and because
I can warm my ass by a real fire.

54
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,600
Those are all terrific reasons.

55
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,300
You ever make it
in front of a log fire?

56
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,200
- Not with you.
- Well, it comes with the house.

57
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:33,000
It's part of the deal.

58
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:55,700
You go sit in those empty seats.

59
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,300
Now, I also do the notes
on "Newcomer's Column"

60
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,300
for The Weekly Chronicle.

61
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,200
You've got the copy
I left in the mailbox?

62
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,000
Yes, thank you.

63
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:21,100
Then you know my style.
It's mainly for ladies.

64
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:24,700
So you just go right ahead
and tell me about yourself.

65
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,600
Well, there's nothing much
to tell, really.

66
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,500
- What does your husband do?
- He's a lawyer.

67
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:35,000
- Lawyer.
- Me,

68
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,500
I'm a sort of hopeful, would-be,
semiprofessional photographer.

69
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:44,500
What do you think you'll miss
most about New York?

70
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,500
Noise.

71
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,700
Well, I don't know who the guy was,
but I'm assuming it was Mr Van Sant.

72
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:38,000
- Well, what time was it?
- Midmorning, way before noon.

73
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,300
Well, they sure start early
in Stepford, don't they?

74
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,600
You mean the guy just
walked up behind her,

75
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,700
and he put his hands
on her boobs?

76
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:49,800
How did he do it exactly?
Was it like this, or was it like...?

77
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,800
Walter.

78
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:55,700
- You're getting me all soapy.
- I'm just trying to get the facts straight.

79
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,400
- It's my legal mind.
- Your sexy mind.

80
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,200
Stepford has really done
things to you.

81
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,500
I'd like to christen
every room in the house

82
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,000
before I pay off the mortgage.

83
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,200
- Just finish the dishes first.
- Yeah.

84
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:08,700
- Tell me about your day.
- Well, I didn't witness

85
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,500
any soft-core porno like you,
so it's dull by comparison.

86
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:17,700
But, oh, I did meet some
of the other Stepford commuters.

87
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,300
- You want coffee?
- Sanka.

88
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:24,300
- Oh, I haven't gone shopping yet.
- Oh, regular will be all right.

89
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,300
They seem like
a bright bunch of guys.

90
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:30,800
I mean, they have
a nice thing going here.

91
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,400
They were telling me
about the Men's Association.

92
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,200
Apparently, it's the thing to join.

93
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,300
It's quite an honour
to be invited to join.

94
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,900
Why is it an honour?

95
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,500
Why is it an honour?

96
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:44,300
Well, because practically every
important guy in town's a member,

97
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:46,700
commuters and townies.
I mean, everybody,

98
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,500
the TV executives, the shrinks,
the scientists, the police chief,

99
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,600
the fire chief, the head of the hospital,
the guy who runs the phone company.

100
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,300
So did they ask you?

101
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,400
- Did they ask me?
- Yes, Walter, am I going crazy?

102
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:02,300
You keep repeating the questions.
Did they ask you?

103
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,900
Well, in a way, yes.

104
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:07,500
In a way you could refuse,
or in a way you had to accept?

105
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,900
Well, they said I had a good chance
of getting in, which I felt good about.

106
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:17,400
I have to admit, though, that there's
one rule that I don't much care for,

107
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:23,600
but apparently, it's gonna be changed
in, oh, six months or something.

108
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,800
Well, what rule is that?

109
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,800
Well, right now
it's strictly men only.

110
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,700
I give up on you.

111
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,200
Well, what's that supposed to mean?

112
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,500
Why don't you ever once
just tell me the truth?

113
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:43,200
You pretend we decide things together,
but it's always you, what you want.

114
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,300
You asked me if I wanted
to move out here,

115
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,700
and I found you'd already been
looking at a house.

116
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,500
You asked me if I liked this place,

117
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,600
and I found you'd already made
a down payment.

118
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:54,100
Now you're asking me about
the lousy Men's Association,

119
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:57,600
and it's quite obvious
you've already joined.

120
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,800
Why bother to ask me at all?

121
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,600
I'm gonna put the kids to bed.

122
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,800
Come on, Daddy's waiting.
Yes, you may. Come on, come on.

123
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:24,500
Ladies, we have specials today
on crenshaw melons,

124
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:28,600
English walnuts and avocados.
That's in aisle seven.

125
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,700
- How much is it?
- $53.13, please.

126
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:33,000
Walter, wait, wait.
Walter, have you made it out?

127
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:36,200
Yeah, I just made it out. Why?

128
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,500
- Oh, my God.
- I'm sorry...

129
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,300
- You can ring it separately.
- All right, OK.

130
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:58,400
OK, Mrs. Sunderson.

131
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:01,500
Hold it a second, Mrs. Sunderson.

132
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:11,500
OK, come on.
Watch it!

133
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,200
Hey, what was that?

134
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,700
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, my God, Carol.

135
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,700
I didn't see you.
I thought it was clear.

136
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:22,500
Oh, my God.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

137
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:26,500
Oh, no, it's nothing, really.
It's just a surprise.

138
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:30,400
- I'm fine. It's just my head. I...
- It wasn't my fault.

139
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,700
I... I didn't mean nothing. It was just
one of those things, you know.

140
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,500
No, I'm fine.

141
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:38,800
It wasn't my fault. You know,
I didn't see the car coming.

142
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,700
It came right...
It wasn't my fault.

143
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,700
It wasn't my fault.

144
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,100
- How do you feel, Carol?
- I'm telling you, I'm fine. I'm really fine.

145
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,100
Isn't that Carol Van Sant?

146
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:04,200
Well, I think that she had
sort of an accident. Come on, now.

147
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,200
Should anyone send
for an ambulance?

148
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,400
Get an ambulance
down here right away.

149
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:13,800
We have an accident.
In the parking lot.

150
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:17,700
Get it down here right away.
In the parking lot.

151
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:21,500
What are you talking about?
I'm looking at... I can see it right now.

152
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,900
Get it down here right away.
Don't give me a hard time.

153
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:29,400
This is all so silly. I...
I'm fine. It's not serious.

154
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,200
What can I do, Carol? Tell me.

155
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,000
- Oh, my groceries.
- I'll take them home for you.

156
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:37,400
- Could you call Larson's Garage?
- Larson's Garage, of course.

157
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:44,500
This is all so silly. It's just my head.
I... Oh, this is all so silly.

158
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,400
It... It's just my head.

159
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:50,000
Poor, Carol.
She's such a nice person.

160
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,200
Do you think you'd get ambulance
service better than this anywhere else?

161
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,000
Two hours you'd wait in New York.

162
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:09,600
And I bet even in Scarsdale,
it'd take 45 minutes. Six minutes or so.

163
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,900
Any of the rest of you
wanna have an accident,

164
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,200
make sure you do it
right here in Stepford.

165
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,900
- OK, pull it on out.
- Six minutes. Can you beat that?

166
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,000
Well, I guess that's
the friendliest accident I ever saw.

167
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:20,600
- You know...
- What?

168
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:24,500
We may be new here,
but isn't Stepford Hospital that way?

169
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:27,300
Oh, no, no, no, you're wrong. It...

170
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,300
No, no...

171
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,300
You're not wrong. The ambulance
went that way, didn't it?

172
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:58,200
Mommy.

173
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,800
Mommy.

174
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,800
What is it?

175
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,000
What is it, sweetie?

176
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:18,200
I think Teddy's gonna cry all night.

177
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,800
Oh, no, look.

178
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
- He's happy. Lookit.
- No, that's his unhappy face.

179
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:29,800
He doesn't like it here.
He's gonna be crying all night.

180
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,000
- What do you think has upset him?
- He doesn't like this room.

181
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:39,300
Oh, yes, he does.

182
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,900
He told me he loves it here.

183
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:45,900
He loves the quiet.

184
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,500
He's thinking about all the honey
he can get out in the trees here.

185
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:57,300
He told me he liked it even better
than Central Park

186
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,000
because he can take walks
by himself,

187
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:03,400
and he doesn't have to worry
about getting lost.

188
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,400
He's really a Stepford bear.

189
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,800
He really knows his way around.

190
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,300
Walter?

191
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,900
You all right?

192
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,100
Yeah.

193
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,400
It's awfully late.

194
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,000
Everything go OK at the initiation?

195
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:38,200
It wasn't an initiation.
This is not a college fraternity.

196
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,500
They just showed me
around the place,

197
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:44,000
and they asked me if I wanted to join.
And I said, yes, I did.

198
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:47,500
Good.
Walter, I was worried.

199
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:50,300
I wake up,
it's the middle of the night.

200
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:54,500
You're sitting here alone, drinking.
Why are you sitting here?

201
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:57,300
Why didn't you come to bed?

202
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,000
I'm coming to bed.

203
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:03,800
Did anybody say something
to upset you?

204
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,200
I'm not upset.

205
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:09,300
There's nothing to be upset about.

206
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:12,200
- Everything's fine.
- It's not fine.

207
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:17,900
I was worried. Walter, I love you,
but you expect me to be a mind reader.

208
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,500
I love you.

209
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,200
I really love you.

210
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,800
Do you...? Do you know that?

211
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:37,900
I really do. And I know
I've screwed this whole thing up.

212
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,100
- You didn't wanna move here.
- Look...

213
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:41,600
- I know that, no.
- I'll get over it.

214
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,800
I've already gotten over it.
That's not what I'm talking about.

215
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,800
Do you understand that
I really love you?

216
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:48,900
Yeah. Yes.

217
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,900
Let's go to bed.

218
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:06,000
I feel like I'm getting old.

219
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,700
You're not getting old.

220
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:13,200
I feel like it.

221
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:19,100
Hi.

222
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:24,300
- Are you Joanna Eberhart?
- Yes.

223
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:27,400
The Joanna Eberhart?

224
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:32,600
Avid shutterbug, ex-Gothamite who
misses the noise of the naked city?

225
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,800
Yes.

226
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:39,800
Hey, boy, am I glad to see you.

227
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:43,900
Hi, I'm Bobby. Bobby Markowe.

228
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:46,200
That's upward mobility for Markowitz.

229
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:49,400
I'm also an ex-Gothamite, who's been
living here in Ajax country

230
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,100
for just over a month now,
and I'm going crazy.

231
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:56,300
You see, doctor, my problem is that,
given complete freedom of choice,

232
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:58,900
I don't wanna squeeze
the goddamn Charmin.

233
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,300
Anyway, I saw your name here.

234
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,600
- I hope you don't think...
- Oh, no.

235
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,600
Yeah, it was fantastic, fantastic.

236
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:08,300
Here you are. Wait a minute, I think
you got a headline. Wait a minute.

237
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:10,500
- No.
- You got a headline on this page.

238
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:14,400
Here she is.
"Eberhart moves to Stepford."

239
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,100
- I wish they'd use one of my...
- "Avid shutterbug."

240
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:17,600
I knew you were fantastic,
you are.

241
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:20,200
Have I seen any of your pictures
in magazines? I know I must have.

242
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,100
- I doubt it.
- Right? You're terrific.

243
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:25,900
I know you are. Eber... I don't know,
but I think I do know you.

244
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:28,300
- Anyway.
- No, but I'm glad to have a friend.

245
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,900
Me too. How do you do?

246
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:32,000
Listen, you wanna go
and have something to drink?

247
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:33,300
- Eat.
- Eat?

248
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,800
- Yeah.
- OK.

249
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:39,000
- I got all this junk here.
- Got any smokes?

250
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,300
I dropped my best camera on my foot.

251
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,400
Have you really got film
in those things?

252
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:47,300
Oh, yes.
I'm the very avid shutterbug.

253
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,900
Yeah, listen, I really...
To tell you the truth,

254
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:52,600
ordinarily, I don't pay
any attention to that newspaper,

255
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,400
- because it's full of it, you know.
- I know.

256
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:56,800
I saw your name,
and it stood out for some reason.

257
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,000
Whatever made you
choose Stepford?

258
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:01,800
- Oh, I didn't. Walter did.
- Oh, yeah, it figures.

259
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:04,000
Dave brought us here
because of land values.

260
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:05,800
He's best in bed
when the market's up.

261
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,300
I think I'll break into
Walter's Scotch.

262
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:13,900
Hey, hey, hey, you know something,
I'm gonna like you.

263
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:16,200
Yeah.

264
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:22,200
A messy kitchen. It's beautiful.
A home away from home.

265
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:25,400
Oh, my, of course,
it doesn't compare to mine.

266
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,600
You haven't got
any of those magnificent

267
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:30,100
peanut-butter handprints
all over your cabinets yet.

268
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:33,000
But then, you're new here,
and Stepford wasn't ruined in a day.

269
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,300
Hello, Hi-C.

270
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,700
Hey, you want a Ring Ding?
I smuggled it over the border.

271
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,800
- What year is it?
- '59, a collector's item.

272
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:45,000
- It'd be great with Scotch.
- Yeah.

273
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,100
Two things I always carry:
Tampax and Ring Dings.

274
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,400
And I don't even wanna
think what that means.

275
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:54,000
I'll tell you. Thanks.

276
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:55,800
I can't figure out this burg.

277
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,300
It's like maids have been
declared illegal,

278
00:26:58,500 --> 00:26:59,800
and the housewife
with the neatest place

279
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:01,600
gets Robert Redford for Christmas.

280
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,500
And believe me,
if that's the prize, I'd enter,

281
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:05,800
but nobody will tell what
the contest rules are.

282
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:07,400
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

283
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:11,600
Not to mention that
creepy Men's Association.

284
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:14,500
- Yours too?
- Every night.

285
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,100
Dave wouldn't miss.

286
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:19,200
- What do you think they do up there?
- Watch dirty movies

287
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,200
and reminisce about
the good old days.

288
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,200
What good old days?

289
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,900
Like those good old days when
Playboy used the airbrush.

290
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,700
Ring Dings and Scotch,
great combination.

291
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,200
- We may have started something.
- I'll drink to that, cheers.

292
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,500
Totally disgusting.

293
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:38,400
- Don't you like it?
- I don't know which one I like the best.

294
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:41,900
You're very honest. That's what
I like about you. It's awful.

295
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:56,900
Hey, it's me.

296
00:27:57,100 --> 00:28:00,800
And I'm here, and I'm on
the New Projects committee.

297
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,600
Yeah, New Projects.

298
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:08,100
Well, how would you feel about some
of the guys meeting at our house?

299
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:11,600
- Well, like now, tonight.
- Well, OK.

300
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:17,800
Yeah, that'd be great. I actually get
to see you and some living people.

301
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:21,400
- Give me a few minutes, huh?
- We'll be along in about 20 minutes.

302
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,600
All right. Bye-bye.

303
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:28,600
- She'd love it.
- Good.

304
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:33,400
You're not altogether sure about
Stepford yet, are you, Walter?

305
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:37,700
No, no, that's not true.

306
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,500
I think I am. It's...

307
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:45,000
It's a big change.
You've got to admit that.

308
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:48,200
A change for the better, Walter.

309
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:06,500
See, I intend to really fix
this place up, you know.

310
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,900
I thought I'd...

311
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:13,100
...make it into sort of
a den-cum-playroom.

312
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:17,100
Maybe I'll put the pool table
right over there.

313
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,800
I thought I'd go to town, you know,
really spoil myself.

314
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,500
It'd be great for the kids.

315
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:25,700
Well, who's talking about the kids?
This is a playroom.

316
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,300
They ain't gonna be allowed in.

317
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:49,500
I like to watch women
doing little domestic chores.

318
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,900
You came to the right town.

319
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:59,400
Who was the one wanted tea?

320
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,200
Claude.

321
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,700
Claude Axhelm.

322
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:09,900
- He's the one who...
- Stutters.

323
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:13,200
I'm not good on names.

324
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,100
Why do they call you "Dis"?

325
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:17,400
Because I used to work
at Disneyland.

326
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:22,300
- No, really.
- That's really. Don't you believe me?

327
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:24,600
No.

328
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,500
- Why not?
- You don't look like someone

329
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:30,800
who enjoys making
other people happy.

330
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,800
It was on the market
for about six months.

331
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:41,400
No kidding. Six months.

332
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:44,800
- Excuse me, your tea.
- Thank you.

333
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:50,500
Oh, you know, I'm really
into speech work, words.

334
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:52,700
Perhaps we might talk
about it sometime.

335
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:57,300
Oh, yes, certainly, absolutely.
Let's get you a napkin.

336
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:03,200
I hope your wife
has gotten over the accident.

337
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:06,000
It was your wife, wasn't it?

338
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:11,000
Oh, yeah, yes. It was nothing.
It looked worse than it was.

339
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:14,200
I should go and see her.
I should've done it before.

340
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,100
She'd like that.

341
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:19,300
- Shall we make a start?
- Is it all right if Joanna sits in?

342
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:23,300
Definitely. I'm sure she's got
a lot to contribute.

343
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:25,400
Well,

344
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:27,900
you want me to get you
a more comfortable chair, hon?

345
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,900
No, it's OK.

346
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:32,500
My drink.

347
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:34,700
Excuse me.

348
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:39,400
Well, we all know what we're here for,
so who's gonna be the first genius?

349
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:45,500
Well, how about the Christmas toys
for the under...? For the poor kids?

350
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,200
For chrissake, Claude,
it's only May.

351
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:53,100
Yeah, well, I guess it's a little early
to start thinking about Christmas.

352
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:56,200
I'm frankly more interested
in the overprivileged kids,

353
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,300
like my son hated camp.
So naturally,

354
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,400
Charmaine won't hear
of him going back.

355
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:03,200
What's he gonna do all summer
besides drive me batty?

356
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:07,100
I thought we might try
a tag sale here this year.

357
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:10,300
Oh, sure, put a tag on all of his toys,
we'll make a fortune.

358
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,300
That's a good idea.

359
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:17,400
I mean, everybody's got something
around the house that they don't need,

360
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:20,200
- and we can help sell it.
- A barn dance.

361
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,800
- Barn dance?
- A barn dance?

362
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,300
- Well, that went out in the '40s.
- Right.

363
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:27,600
I think a barn dance would be
a good idea. Well, I'd like it anyway.

364
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,100
You're talking about a square dance,
aren't you?

365
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:32,500
Is that what you mean,
a square dance?

366
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:42,500
Hey, hey, wait. Anybody
ever heard of a cakewalk?

367
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,200
- A cakewalk?
- Yeah, a cakewalk.

368
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,500
- It's a dance.
- It's a terrific way to raise money.

369
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:50,300
Cakewalk is not a dance.

370
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:56,100
It's a thing where all the women bring
over cakes, then you draw this circle

371
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,700
on the floor. And you've got numbers,
and everybody circles...

372
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,800
Now, look, could we just get back
to the original subject?

373
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:04,600
Now, I brought up the possibility
of a tag sale.

374
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,400
Do you think we can
go through with that or not?

375
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:08,000
I thought we talked about it.

376
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:10,500
Well, nobody said whether they
really were for or against a tag sale.

377
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:12,000
Well, he said something
about a barn dance.

378
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,500
Do you wanna do a barn dance
or a tag sale?

379
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,700
We even suggested the possibility
of putting the barn dance

380
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,400
and the tag sale together
at the same time.

381
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:20,100
Ted, Ted, wait a minute, wait.

382
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:23,000
You have a better idea about the town.

383
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:28,500
I would go for the sale because I think
you'd get, like, somebody's garage

384
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:31,600
- and you could do that.
- Whose garage could we use?

385
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:33,200
And I have to tell you

386
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:36,400
that we've always run the club
democratically, and we've...

387
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:38,000
- Claude.
- We've always...

388
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:41,900
- You are full of crap.
- It's not my fault, because...

389
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:43,700
- Claude.
- And I wanna tell you

390
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:47,000
that I'm kind of disgusted about the
way you guys are handling yourselves

391
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,600
- at this meeting.
- Well, now, wait a minute, Ed.

392
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:51,800
We're just trying
to get some ideas for you.

393
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:55,000
I think you ought to appoint me
chairman, I'll run the whole thing.

394
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:57,900
If you'd run the whole thing, you're
gonna alienate everybody in this town.

395
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,100
If I can't do it,
my wife, Charmaine, will.

396
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:04,000
Excuse me. Let me see if I kind
of get the consensus of all this.

397
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:07,800
You really are more interested
in one kind of big event rather than

398
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:11,300
a lot of little ones? Is that fair to say?
I mean, is that what you're...?

399
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:15,200
I mean, a tag sale and all that
nonsense is really not appropriate, is it?

400
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:19,300
You want something big because we
have a real need here for some...

401
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,700
Well, you know, I think this has been
a very successful meeting. Don't you?

402
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:27,200
I think we got enough things that we
can present to the meeting, you know.

403
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,700
- Walter.
- When is the next meeting?

404
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,900
- What?
- I'm gonna go check on the children.

405
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:32,500
- Excuse me.
- Yes, yes.

406
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:34,000
After...

407
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:55,400
- Are you still driving that big Lincoln?
- Yeah, yeah.

408
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,700
You should have traded it in years ago.

409
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:59,500
Well, if you drive the way you talk,

410
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:02,400
you're gonna have a lot of accidents,
I'll tell you that.

411
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,600
Any...? Anybody else want a nightcap?

412
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:08,900
Yeah, get me a decent brandy, will
you? Instead of this cooking sherry.

413
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,500
Yes.

414
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:16,300
In case you're wondering
what I've been doing.

415
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:19,400
- You're not the lke Mazzard are you?
- I'm afraid so.

416
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:22,800
Oh, no. Walter, tell him.
I'm just awful on names.

417
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:24,400
You'll have to forgive me.

418
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:27,100
I used to gawk at all those girls
in those magazines.

419
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,400
You blighted my adolescence,
you know that.

420
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:31,300
I thought I blighted your adolescence.

421
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:34,200
I can't get over this.

422
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,100
- Is this for me?
- Keep it.

423
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:39,600
Keep it? I'll insure it.
Thank you so much.

424
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:41,700
My pleasure.

425
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,000
- Here you are, lke.
- Thanks.

426
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,500
See what you missed.

427
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:48,200
Oh. Oh, yeah, it's...

428
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:52,900
It's... It's very good
around the eyes, you...

429
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:00,500
You've been a long time.

430
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,000
I'm just clearing up some things.

431
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,900
I just can't stand to come down in the
morning to a bunch of filthy ashtrays.

432
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:12,300
What do you think?
Nice bunch of guys, huh?

433
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,600
You serious?

434
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,700
You have to be kidding.
You wouldn't have given those bores

435
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,400
the time of day back in Manhattan.

436
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:28,300
I mean, OK.

437
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:32,100
I was pleased to get this,
and he was quite sweet. But the rest...

438
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:35,900
- Well, I don't happen to agree.
- Walter, you must agree.

439
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,600
My God, they're worse
than your senior partners.

440
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:43,000
New Projects committee. They ought
to start by working on themselves.

441
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,800
- Well, that's your opinion.
- Well, of course it's my opinion.

442
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:49,000
Who else sat there?
Where's your sense of humour?

443
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,700
They were dummies.

444
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:54,500
I mean, take el presidente,
that graduate of Disneyland.

445
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:57,100
Well, he just happens to be a Ph.D.
From Berkeley.

446
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,200
He runs a multimillion-dollar
corporation.

447
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:02,000
What do they make, sleeping pills?
Look, this isn't me,

448
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:04,500
and what you're saying isn't you.

449
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:08,000
- You're putting me on.
- No.

450
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,100
No. I...

451
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:16,600
Look, this... This is Stepford.
It's not New York or...

452
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:20,900
These are the people we have to
live with and... And they suit me.

453
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,700
- Yeah, they really are.
- I gotta go see...

454
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,500
- You gonna be around later?
- Yeah.

455
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,300
OK. Bye-bye.

456
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:55,000
- Got a drink there?
- Oh, I'm fine. Thanks.

457
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,100
Yeah? Sure?

458
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:00,100
Yeah. Hey, listen, Marie. You want
to go for a swim later? Marie, huh?

459
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,100
- Oh, yes. I'd love that, Dale.
- OK. All right.

460
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:03,800
- Thank you very much.
- All right.

461
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
- I haven't forgotten your...
- Where's my wife?

462
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:07,300
Where is your wife?

463
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,400
- Hi, Walter.
- Hey, Dis. How are you?

464
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:11,200
I'm fine. How are you?
Good to see you.

465
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:12,800
- Yeah.
- Hey, good to see you.

466
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,600
Ed is having a hell of a time down
there with Bobby.

467
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,200
- Give him a hand, will you?
- OK, sure. We'll go down

468
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,400
and give him a hand.

469
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:25,200
Get some drinks down to the pool
right away. Come on.

470
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:43,500
Over there, there's some kids
you can play with.

471
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:54,100
Can you believe all this?

472
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:58,400
For a bachelor, old Dis
must be quite a catch.

473
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,600
What do you say we go home
and change?

474
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:02,200
Like put on a fancy dress?

475
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:04,100
Absolutely not.

476
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,700
- Hello.
- Hello.

477
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,800
- How are you?
- Fine, thank you.

478
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:10,600
- Lovely party.
- Yes.

479
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,000
Did you get a look at the food?

480
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,900
How about photographing it
for a Save the Children poster?

481
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:24,900
Like Walter says, it's all so dazzling.
Why don't I like it?

482
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:29,000
I mean, I like it. It's perfect.
How could you not like it?

483
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,800
I just don't like it.
Am I making any sense?

484
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:34,000
- Well, hi, you two.
- Hi.

485
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:35,900
You want to come
and meet some people?

486
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:38,000
Why not? We're not proud.

487
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:40,200
Oh, you haven't got a drink.

488
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:42,900
I must get you a drink.

489
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,200
Good shot.

490
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,800
- All right, who's first here?
- And a medium well.

491
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:54,300
- Don't use the tongs.
- No, that's right. Use that, will you?

492
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,300
- This is the Wimpiris way.
- What is that? Is that medium?

493
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,800
That's a medium. This is a rare.

494
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:00,400
Rare.

495
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:03,900
I'll just die if I don't get this recipe.

496
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,800
Want another well...?
You want a well-done?

497
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:11,300
Well, I told you to move them over.

498
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:14,300
Move them over toward the centre.

499
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:22,100
I'll just die if I don't get this recipe.

500
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:51,500
I'll just die if I don't get this recipe.

501
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,100
- Walter?
- Yes?

502
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:07,300
- Take over, will you?
- OK.

503
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:13,800
How many of these have you had?

504
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:16,800
Don't you know
you can't handle this stuff?

505
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:19,600
Don't you remember
what this stuff does to you?

506
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:22,400
I'll just die if I don't get this recipe.

507
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:25,400
Why the hell do you do this
in public?

508
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:29,900
Come on.
We'll just go and get a little coffee.

509
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:39,300
Well, it was this problem I had,
you see. I...

510
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:42,900
I couldn't handle it.
It was out of control.

511
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:48,100
I guess that's one of the reasons
Ted moved us to Stepford. The...

512
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:51,000
The drinking was getting so bad,

513
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:54,000
and he blamed the city
and all its pressures.

514
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,700
And, oh, I knew I shouldn't have
touched the stuff.

515
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:59,800
But I did, and I'm sorry I ruined it all.

516
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:03,300
- You don't have to apologize, Carol.
- Not to us.

517
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:06,500
We just felt that it was important
that you two understand,

518
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,400
you being the newest in Stepford.

519
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:10,700
We didn't want you
getting the wrong opinion.

520
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:13,600
"We"? Who is "we"?

521
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:16,600
Oh, well, Ted, naturally.

522
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,900
And lke was there, and...

523
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:23,700
Oh, he's so old and smart that, after I'd
sobered up some, we asked him and...

524
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:26,700
You mean the men made you come
and apologize like this?

525
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:31,200
Oh, no.
No, I wanted to, really.

526
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:34,100
All they did was
sort of confirm my feelings.

527
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:37,300
- Well, why don't you come in.
- Oh, no.

528
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:39,600
No, I've got to get back. I...

529
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:43,000
I've seen Charmaine and...

530
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:45,200
Well, I...

531
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:47,500
I ought to get back.

532
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,400
Incredible.

533
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:01,700
Absolutely unbelievable.

534
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:05,600
If I was forced to apologize
every time I got smashed,

535
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,100
I'd spend my whole life
wandering around saying,

536
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,900
"I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry."

537
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,800
That is a lady
that could use some help.

538
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:18,100
I told you I...

539
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:20,600
...messed a little bit
with women's lib in New York.

540
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,700
Didn't we all?

541
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:27,300
I'm not contemplating
any Maidenform bonfires,

542
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:31,100
but they could certainly use
something around here.

543
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:35,000
- Oh, yeah.
- You game?

544
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:39,500
I'm game.

545
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,700
Boy, am I game!

546
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:44,500
Wow!

547
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:47,900
Gee, it sounds like fun.

548
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:50,900
But I've got three kids,
and the oldest is 6.

549
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:53,700
And that doesn't leave me
with a whole lot of extra time.

550
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:55,900
We really understand, Marie.

551
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:59,500
And we're not after you
to change your whole lifestyle,

552
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:02,800
but doesn't it ever bother you
that the most important organisation

553
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:04,800
in Stepford is sexually archaic?

554
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:10,200
- Archaic?
- Old-fashioned. Out-of-date.

555
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:14,800
Does it ever bother me?
No.

556
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:18,200
I've never been
much of a joiner, I'm afraid.

557
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:21,700
I guess it's because I've just been
so busy, what with baking and all that.

558
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,600
This isn't any kind of a lifelong
commitment we're after.

559
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:26,700
We just want to see
if there's any interest

560
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,700
for some kind of activities in Stepford.
That's all.

561
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:32,800
Well, there isn't any interest here,
Joanna.

562
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:37,700
I know I shouldn't say this,
but I just love my brownies.

563
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:44,600
I'm sorry. I just can't waste my
spare moments on something like that.

564
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:47,500
But you do go out sometimes,
don't you?

565
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:49,100
Go out?

566
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:50,700
Of course I go out.

567
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:53,300
I'm out now, aren't I?

568
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:55,300
Which one do you like?

569
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:59,100
Oh, I don't think either one.

570
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:01,600
- This is who?
- Cornell.

571
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:04,400
Husband owns the pharmacy.
She works there sometimes.

572
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:06,700
What I'd give for her chest.

573
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:14,500
There's this thing they've invented.
It's called knocking.

574
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,900
Doesn't interest me.
I'm a natural-born barger.

575
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:32,800
God, I just love that.

576
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:39,900
- Hey.
- Oh, yes. Yes.

577
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:43,500
Oh, yes.

578
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:49,900
Nobody's ever touched me
the way you touch me.

579
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:53,700
Oh, there.

580
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:58,000
Oh, you're the best, Frank.

581
00:45:58,300 --> 00:46:02,000
Oh, God, are you the best.

582
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:04,100
Oh, there.

583
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:09,800
- Wait.
- Oh, God.

584
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:14,000
- God, are you the best.
- Let's go.

585
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:16,800
You're the king, Frank.

586
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:21,000
Oh, you're the champion, Frank.

587
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:25,300
Oh, you're the master!

588
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:31,200
- Is this the right place?
- Must be.

589
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:33,700
- Last house on Snowflake Lane.
- You're sure, now?

590
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:38,800
- We don't want to strike out again.
- "Oh, God, Frank, I'm sure. I'm sure."

591
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,400
Wasn't that awful? All your fault too.

592
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:44,000
I know, but this time,
I got us an invitation.

593
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:46,300
Listen, her name's
Charmaine Wimpiris.

594
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:49,200
And we were buying our kids shoes.
And I got to talking, and she said,

595
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:51,200
"Come on over.
It sounds interesting."

596
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:54,200
The way we've been bombing out,
I consider that a triumph.

597
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:56,700
- She said her court's in the back.
- OK.

598
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:06,600
Game.

599
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:09,600
- Five-one. Let's change.
- OK.

600
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,900
God, this is fun.

601
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:17,200
No!

602
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:19,700
- Oh, that was great.
- Oh, I haven't played

603
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:22,800
- in such a long time.
- Oh, you're good. You're really good.

604
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:25,500
I can tell that.
You're just out of practice.

605
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:28,200
Really. Hey, didn't you think
she was terrific?

606
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:30,200
I thought you were terrific.

607
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:36,100
Oh, well, listen. Play at my place
any time you want. I really mean that.

608
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:39,800
Now, Jenny Fisher used to play.
She finked out on me.

609
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:41,700
The only competition I've got left

610
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,100
are two teenage boys
with permanent erections.

611
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:46,200
- Send them to my place.
- Are you kidding?

612
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:48,000
I'd be lost without them.

613
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:50,100
Why don't you get her that...

614
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:51,800
- Give you some lessons.
- I'll give you a lesson.

615
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,300
- Thank you. No.
- Come on, I need the workout.

616
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:58,500
Thank you, Nettie.
Isn't Nettie marvellous?

617
00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:02,200
A German Virgo.
Their thing is, you know, to serve.

618
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:06,200
Oh, that's why we won the war.

619
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:11,900
Well, girls, I didn't get you here
on false pretences, really. I...

620
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:16,300
I'm interested. I'm no fanatic,
but I'm really interested.

621
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:19,400
Actually, we moved here
about two months ago,

622
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:21,600
and Ed joins
this Men's Association.

623
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,500
Believe me,
I know that it's unfair and sexist,

624
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:29,000
but, frankly, anything that gets him
out of the house nights is fine with me.

625
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:32,100
If we could get a consciousness-raising
group going, you'd come?

626
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:36,300
- What?
- A consciousness-raising session.

627
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:39,700
- A bitching session, you mean.
- Sure.

628
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:42,200
Like a shot, I'd come.

629
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:45,800
You wouldn't believe
what Ed tries putting me through.

630
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,200
He has a rubber suit
made for me in England.

631
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:53,600
- Well!
- How about that, sports fans?

632
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:57,400
What is a rubber suit?

633
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,700
I'm an accent freak.

634
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:04,500
I'm not sure why.
Probably on account of...

635
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:07,500
I don't know if you've noticed
or not, but I stammer.

636
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:10,600
- When you were young, you mean?
- No, no.

637
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:15,200
I still do.
Just I work extra hard to control it.

638
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:17,300
Now, here.

639
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:20,500
I want you to write down
every place you've ever lived,

640
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:23,200
from when you were born until now.

641
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:28,900
And this is just standard vocabulary.

642
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:31,500
See, just straight through the alphabet.

643
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:35,400
"A. Aback. Abandon." Like that.

644
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:41,900
And this here's easy to operate.
Just push the switch and talk into it.

645
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,900
I think I can manage that,

646
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,900
- but what's this for?
- Just a lifelong hobby.

647
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:52,400
- Don't touch.
- See, once I get enough samples,

648
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:56,900
I aim to feed them all
into a computer and program it.

649
00:49:57,300 --> 00:50:01,300
What I'll get back is an instant
geographical rundown on a person.

650
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:04,900
I really think it'll be more important
than fingerprints in police work.

651
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:10,600
That's very interesting, Claude,
but it's too much work.

652
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:15,200
We Stepford wives are busy, busy,
busy. You know, like your wife.

653
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:18,700
- Is he going to take your fingerprints?
- No, sweetie.

654
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,400
Just like your wife.

655
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:23,500
Bobby and I tried to involve her
in one of our projects,

656
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:25,100
but she had too much ironing.

657
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:28,900
Maybe you could convince her.

658
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:33,000
Kit Sunderson too.
If they could find the time for me,

659
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:34,800
I could find it for you.

660
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:39,800
Isn't this kind of blackmail, Joanna?

661
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:43,800
It's what made this country great,
Claude.

662
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:52,400
Usually we start out bitching,

663
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:55,700
but maybe if we're lucky, we can get
into something more constructive.

664
00:50:57,700 --> 00:50:59,000
Anybody have any questions?

665
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:07,200
Well, good.

666
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:08,900
Then we might as well get started.

667
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:13,300
Fine. Terrific.

668
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:15,800
Who wants to go first?

669
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,900
Talk about anything.

670
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:25,100
Sex, money, our marriages,
anything at all.

671
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:32,200
Well, how about if I start?

672
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:36,000
Right, yes, well...

673
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:41,300
I think there are times when
Walter cares more about the law

674
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:43,200
than he does about me,

675
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:44,800
and that can hurt.

676
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:47,000
I don't think that...

677
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:51,100
I don't think that Ed ever loved me.

678
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:53,500
I mean,

679
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:55,800
he married me
because I looked right.

680
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:59,800
It made a big impression
on the other TV executives for his wife

681
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:02,300
to look like I look.

682
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:07,400
God knows he's given me things.

683
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:12,100
I'm not complaining
on that score, but...

684
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:16,400
He never loved me.

685
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:20,800
I didn't bake anything yesterday.

686
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:24,400
Took me so long to get
the upstairs floor to shine,

687
00:52:24,700 --> 00:52:26,300
I didn't have any time to bake.

688
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:29,200
Well, you don't have to bake, Kit.
There's no law.

689
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:32,700
Hell, Ed's lucky if I remember
to keep him in white bread.

690
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:35,800
Easy On spray starch.

691
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,700
It must save me
half an hour a day, at least.

692
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,900
You'll never run short of time again.
I guarantee it.

693
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:45,400
I've just been tempted so many times
to try Easy On.

694
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:48,500
I'm not trying to be
a leader or anything,

695
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:51,700
but we're not supposed to delve
quite so specifically into housework.

696
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:54,400
Easy On's really that good, is it?

697
00:52:54,700 --> 00:52:59,000
Is it that good? Well, if time is your
enemy, make friends with Easy On.

698
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:00,700
That's all I can tell you.

699
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:05,000
It's so good
that if ever I became famous

700
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:07,900
and the Easy On people asked
me would I do a commercial,

701
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:11,900
not only would I do it,
I'd do it for free.

702
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:14,200
That's how good it is.

703
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:16,500
Holy cow.

704
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:39,600
I think I'll take Fred for a walk.

705
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:41,300
Fred?

706
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:44,200
- Where is he? Did he get out again?
- No.

707
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:46,700
I said I was going to take him
for a walk.

708
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:50,700
You going out?

709
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,600
No, I'm gonna walk him
around the bathroom.

710
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:56,500
You just keep doing
whatever you're doing.

711
00:53:56,700 --> 00:53:59,000
I'm very fond of you.

712
00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:02,500
Well, I'm fond of you too.

713
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:04,300
Fred!

714
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:07,700
Freddie. Wanna go for a walk?

715
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:09,900
Fine, Walter, just fine.

716
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,700
Fred.

717
00:55:29,900 --> 00:55:31,400
Fred.

718
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:34,600
Come on back here now.
Don't give me a hard time!

719
00:55:35,900 --> 00:55:37,500
Fred!

720
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:49,500
Fred.

721
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:10,900
Fred. Come here.

722
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:51,700
Sorry about that, lady.
I really didn't mean to frighten you.

723
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:58,300
- Oh, it's Mrs Eberhart.
- Yes. And you did frighten me.

724
00:56:58,700 --> 00:57:00,400
Once again, Mrs Eberhart,
my apologies.

725
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:03,000
But this is a pretty quiet town.

726
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:06,200
Lot of very nice houses, like your own.

727
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:09,900
People have valuable things.
We have to be careful.

728
00:57:11,300 --> 00:57:13,300
You see that old mansion
over there?

729
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:16,200
- It's a landmark building.
- I didn't know that.

730
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:19,800
Some railroad tycoon built it in 1870.

731
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:22,600
Before the Men's Association
took it over, it was a wreck.

732
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:25,000
Now the Association's got
a restoration committee

733
00:57:25,300 --> 00:57:29,100
to try and fix up what was ruined,
so we have to be very careful.

734
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:31,600
We can't let people
just walk around at night.

735
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:34,200
One of the reasons I moved
from the city

736
00:57:34,300 --> 00:57:36,100
was so I could walk around at night.

737
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:40,100
Well, certainly, you and Fred
can walk around at night.

738
00:57:40,700 --> 00:57:42,900
But I'd stick a little closer to home.

739
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:46,900
Really, Mrs Eberhart, this isn't the
best place for you to wander around.

740
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,800
I see.

741
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,800
- Thank you. Good night.
- Good night.

742
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:34,500
Come on, Ed, let me drive.

743
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:37,800
You're in no fit state, OK?

744
00:58:46,700 --> 00:58:48,200
All right?

745
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:51,300
Thattaboy.

746
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:58,100
Just lie back and relax.

747
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:02,100
Feel OK?

748
00:59:02,900 --> 00:59:04,800
Good.

749
00:59:05,100 --> 00:59:06,700
All right. Here we go.

750
00:59:21,100 --> 00:59:23,100
Joanna.

751
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:26,500
Joanna. Come over here.
Come over here.

752
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:42,000
- Hi, dear.
- That's lovely, honey.

753
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:44,800
All right, ladies?
Got everything you want?

754
00:59:45,100 --> 00:59:47,200
- Oh, yes, thanks.
- Have a good day.

755
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:49,500
Thanks so much.

756
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:57,000
- I was trying to tell you.
- Yes, what was that about?

757
00:59:57,400 --> 00:59:59,700
- That was Frank.
- Frank?

758
00:59:59,900 --> 01:00:02,600
The house. Remember?
That was Frank.

759
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:04,600
And that was Mrs Frank.

760
01:00:04,900 --> 01:00:07,600
- "God, there, Frank, yes."
- Oh, I remember.

761
01:00:07,900 --> 01:00:10,100
I remember. God.

762
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:12,700
Now, how about that
for our Stepford twosome.

763
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:16,400
- Oh, God, yes. Wait a minute.
- OK.

764
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:18,300
We're going the wrong way.
I have to go this way.

765
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:19,900
- Cleaners.
- Yes.

766
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:21,500
- Hi.
- On the other side.

767
01:00:21,700 --> 01:00:23,000
- Hi.
- Hello.

768
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:25,700
Have you heard?
Just spreading like wildfire.

769
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:29,400
A black family's moving into town.

770
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:32,000
Think that's good?

771
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:34,900
I think it's good.
Well, I don't know if I think it's good

772
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:37,600
so much as I think it's natural,
considering, well,

773
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:41,700
I mean, after all,
we are the most liberal town around.

774
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:43,800
- Stepford?
- Liberal?

775
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:45,600
Well, sure.

776
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:48,600
We have the first Chinese restaurant
in Fairfield County.

777
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:50,100
Ah, yes.

778
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:53,000
And we had the first women's club

779
01:00:53,300 --> 01:00:56,700
to ask any of those liberation ladies
to come lecture.

780
01:00:57,100 --> 01:00:59,500
- There are no women's clubs here.
- There was.

781
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:01,700
I went to a meeting once.

782
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,800
There must have been
50 of us there.

783
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:07,900
Well, where the hell are they?

784
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:09,500
Some of them moved away,

785
01:01:09,700 --> 01:01:11,700
but I guess most of them
just plain got bored.

786
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,300
I know I did.

787
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:16,000
There we are. Off you go.

788
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:18,600
We disbanded, oh,

789
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:22,000
years ago. We weren't
accomplishing anything useful.

790
01:01:22,300 --> 01:01:24,500
You mean useful
like doing housework?

791
01:01:25,500 --> 01:01:27,500
I like to see my home looking nice.

792
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:30,200
Look, we found this at the library.

793
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,800
Listen, Carol, it says you were
president of that club.

794
01:01:34,100 --> 01:01:36,900
I only took the post
because nobody else would.

795
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:40,200
Please explain to me what you're into.

796
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:42,300
Is it enough?

797
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:46,500
Well, enough for me maybe is
not enough for you, Joanna, but...

798
01:01:46,900 --> 01:01:51,700
Well, you see, Ted's doing really well
in his scientific research now,

799
01:01:52,300 --> 01:01:54,500
and I give him a good home.

800
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:56,200
I really think that helps.

801
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:00,500
The kids are doing the best
they've ever done in school,

802
01:02:00,900 --> 01:02:02,700
and I'm here all the time. I...

803
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:06,400
Well, I know that helps too.

804
01:02:06,700 --> 01:02:11,200
I'm really off the booze,
and God knows that's better.

805
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:15,000
It's none of your business,
but our sex life is better too.

806
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:20,700
Look, I'm sorry to disappoint you,
but I'm happy.

807
01:02:22,700 --> 01:02:24,600
I'm happy.

808
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,300
You know,
maybe we're the crazy ones.

809
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:31,600
Don't say that. We're not.

810
01:02:32,100 --> 01:02:35,400
- You sure?
- We're fine.

811
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:37,500
OK.

812
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:39,600
We are fine.

813
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:36,700
- Hi.
- How'd it go?

814
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:40,700
What? Oh, well, he hated them.

815
01:03:41,300 --> 01:03:45,000
I must say, I was inclined to agree.
I don't know what made me take them.

816
01:03:45,300 --> 01:03:47,000
But still...

817
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,900
Did the girls bring Fred over
when they came?

818
01:03:52,100 --> 01:03:53,400
Not that I know of.

819
01:03:53,700 --> 01:03:56,900
Oh, shoot.
And he has no license, nothing.

820
01:03:57,300 --> 01:03:59,700
Can I leave the kids here a bit
while I go look for him?

821
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,300
Sure, I'll go with you.

822
01:04:02,500 --> 01:04:06,600
- Dave, will you take care of the kids?
- OK.

823
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:08,600
I'll be right back.

824
01:04:08,900 --> 01:04:10,900
All right, Mommy.

825
01:04:11,100 --> 01:04:14,400
We'll find him. Tell me more about
what that fink said in the gallery.

826
01:04:17,900 --> 01:04:21,200
Fred! Fred!

827
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:30,500
- Did you see what I saw?
- Found him?

828
01:04:31,300 --> 01:04:33,600
No, back at Charmaine's.

829
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:39,000
Oh, my God.

830
01:05:15,300 --> 01:05:19,600
You see, Ed hated tennis,
but he never said a word.

831
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:23,500
All he wanted to do was to please me.

832
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:30,000
Well, I want to please him now,
and, boy, am I ever going to.

833
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:34,200
You see, we spent this weekend
at this beautiful little inn in Vermont.

834
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:37,600
Just Ed and me, you know,
talking things through.

835
01:05:37,900 --> 01:05:40,900
The Park Merrill with some friends,
the Fishers,

836
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:43,000
and we had the most terrific time.

837
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:47,100
I can't get my mind operating.

838
01:05:49,300 --> 01:05:51,900
Besides, I'm just swamped with work.

839
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:55,200
- Work?
- Oh, yes. I fired Nettie.

840
01:05:55,500 --> 01:05:57,000
Yeah, it was...

841
01:05:57,300 --> 01:06:00,900
It was just the being alone with Ed
that did it.

842
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:05,200
All I ever thought about before
was just me.

843
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:07,300
Well,

844
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:10,200
I'm here to tell you
that's all over now.

845
01:06:10,500 --> 01:06:13,400
Ed's always hankered
after a heated swimming pool.

846
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:15,400
And now he's going to get it.

847
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:43,300
Look, I've been doing
a little research, OK?

848
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:44,900
And a lot of thinking.

849
01:06:45,100 --> 01:06:47,300
And I know what I'm gonna say
is gonna sound crazy,

850
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:51,200
but if you laugh at it,
I swear to God I'm gonna be sick.

851
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:54,900
OK, you remember hearing about
the Texas tranquilliser?

852
01:06:55,100 --> 01:06:57,300
It was in TIME. I cut it out.

853
01:06:57,600 --> 01:06:59,700
Wait a second. Sit down.

854
01:07:01,900 --> 01:07:06,200
Issue dated October 4th, 1971.
'71, right.

855
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:09,500
It's about why there are
almost no murders in El Paso.

856
01:07:09,900 --> 01:07:11,600
See, this scientist has this theory

857
01:07:11,900 --> 01:07:14,000
that there's something that
comes from the water in El Paso.

858
01:07:14,300 --> 01:07:15,600
It comes from deep wells,

859
01:07:15,900 --> 01:07:19,600
and it's got some chemical tranquilliser
in it and... Well, read.

860
01:07:19,900 --> 01:07:21,300
See?

861
01:07:21,600 --> 01:07:23,600
Dallas is over two times as big
as El Paso,

862
01:07:23,900 --> 01:07:26,900
but that year, there were 242 murders
in Dallas.

863
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:29,800
And there were only 13 in El Paso.

864
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:34,100
Joanna. Joanna, I think
that's what's going on in Stepford.

865
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:36,000
I think there's something in the water

866
01:07:36,300 --> 01:07:39,300
that turns us into hausfraus, drones,
whatever you want to call it.

867
01:07:39,700 --> 01:07:41,600
Charmaine's changed,
Carol Van Sant's changed,

868
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:44,100
and so have all those other
women's club members.

869
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:47,000
Well, I...
I suppose it's possible.

870
01:07:47,500 --> 01:07:49,000
It can't all be coincidence.

871
01:07:49,700 --> 01:07:51,800
Look at all those places.

872
01:07:52,100 --> 01:07:54,700
Electronics, computers,
aerospace junk.

873
01:07:55,700 --> 01:07:59,000
And labs. Who knows what?

874
01:08:00,100 --> 01:08:03,100
They must all be dumping
their chemical garbage

875
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:05,100
in the Stepford River,

876
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:07,100
and it could be making
its way to us.

877
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:11,300
Listen, the 6:00 news
scares me every night.

878
01:08:11,700 --> 01:08:13,600
I don't see what's so far-out
about my theory.

879
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:17,200
All right. Why don't we write
the state environmental agency

880
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:20,100
and have them check
the water in the reservoir.

881
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:23,200
Governmental agencies.
I've worked for them, Joanna.

882
01:08:23,500 --> 01:08:26,000
And I mean, if they're way above
average or any good at all,

883
01:08:26,300 --> 01:08:28,900
they'll manage to lose a letter
if you send it to them.

884
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:32,300
They teach courses in misfiling
at those places.

885
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:34,200
You know what I think
we ought to do?

886
01:08:34,500 --> 01:08:37,400
I think we ought to take a sample
of the water ourselves

887
01:08:37,700 --> 01:08:40,000
and then get it
to a trustworthy chemist.

888
01:08:40,300 --> 01:08:42,600
Trouble is,
I don't know anybody except...

889
01:08:42,900 --> 01:08:46,100
...you know, guys at that
stinking Men's Association.

890
01:08:46,500 --> 01:08:49,100
I lost my virginity
to a trustworthy chemist.

891
01:08:50,300 --> 01:08:52,100
No kidding.

892
01:08:52,300 --> 01:08:54,200
Did he do it on Blue Cross?

893
01:08:54,500 --> 01:08:56,800
- His name was Raymond Chandler.
- Oh, gosh.

894
01:08:57,100 --> 01:09:02,800
And we had a gag, a sort of stupid,
private thing going.

895
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:07,900
I used to ask him
why he didn't talk like he wrote.

896
01:09:08,100 --> 01:09:10,200
He wasn't a bit hard-boiled,

897
01:09:10,500 --> 01:09:13,700
and he hated any sort of violence.
But I kept it going.

898
01:09:14,100 --> 01:09:15,700
Some nights I wouldn't let
him touch me

899
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,600
until he told me the plot
of his next novel.

900
01:09:18,900 --> 01:09:22,000
Which was, of course,
The Big Sleep.

901
01:09:23,100 --> 01:09:25,700
Sometimes it nearly drove him crazy.

902
01:09:26,200 --> 01:09:29,200
Isn't it funny the things you do
when you're in love?

903
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:34,500
We were both seniors at NYU,
and it wasn't just passion. It was love.

904
01:09:34,900 --> 01:09:37,000
Why didn't you marry him?

905
01:09:37,300 --> 01:09:39,000
I don't know.

906
01:09:40,300 --> 01:09:42,600
Maybe we took the joke too far.

907
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:45,000
Maybe the fun went out of it.

908
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:49,600
I thought Walter was going
to become Perry Mason.

909
01:09:50,500 --> 01:09:52,700
So it was Farewell, My Lovely.

910
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
Did you ever see that?

911
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:59,900
Anyway, I think if I look
in the phone book

912
01:10:00,300 --> 01:10:03,700
and this guy is still in New York,
then he's our man.

913
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,100
- Are you out of your mind?
- No.

914
01:10:06,300 --> 01:10:10,100
I can't just call him up and say,
"Hi, I used to be Joanna Ingles.

915
01:10:10,500 --> 01:10:13,900
"You deflowered me 12 years ago.
Would you check my water?"

916
01:10:14,700 --> 01:10:18,600
Final gas-chromatograph readings
will be coming in in a minute or two.

917
01:10:18,900 --> 01:10:22,400
- Thank you so much for this.
- Oh, don't be silly.

918
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:25,900
- Long time.
- Twelve years.

919
01:10:28,200 --> 01:10:30,200
You married a dentist,
wasn't that it?

920
01:10:30,500 --> 01:10:32,100
Lawyer.

921
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:34,300
You happy?

922
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:37,900
- Yes, very.
- Good, good.

923
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:41,900
- Are you married?
- Going on nine years.

924
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:44,700
And, yes, very.

925
01:10:45,900 --> 01:10:47,200
Here's the report you ordered,
Mr Chandler.

926
01:10:47,500 --> 01:10:49,100
Thank you, Elizabeth.

927
01:10:50,700 --> 01:10:55,100
Well, I can say right off the bat that...

928
01:10:57,400 --> 01:10:59,700
...you've got water in your water.

929
01:11:02,500 --> 01:11:03,800
Now, what can I tell you girls?

930
01:11:04,100 --> 01:11:06,300
I mean, I wouldn't want to drink
too much of it,

931
01:11:07,100 --> 01:11:09,300
- but it's water.
- Can't you be more specific?

932
01:11:09,900 --> 01:11:12,600
Yes, but in order to do that,

933
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:16,300
I'd specifically have to know
what it is I'm trying to find.

934
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:21,200
I mean, there's nothing here.
Look at that.

935
01:11:25,300 --> 01:11:29,200
Well, can you go any further
in confirming my suspicions?

936
01:11:31,100 --> 01:11:33,500
I'm sorry, about what?

937
01:11:33,800 --> 01:11:36,500
The women in Stepford
love housework,

938
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:40,500
and I thought there might be
something in the water.

939
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:44,800
- Where did you find her?
- It's not funny.

940
01:11:45,100 --> 01:11:46,500
No, it isn't.

941
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:49,500
All right. You're right.
Look, that was rude of me.

942
01:11:49,700 --> 01:11:51,100
- Mrs...
- Markowe.

943
01:11:51,400 --> 01:11:52,700
Markowe.

944
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:56,900
I can tell you categorically that there's
no such thing as a cleaner-compeller.

945
01:11:57,200 --> 01:12:00,900
If there was, I would patent it myself,
make a million bucks,

946
01:12:01,200 --> 01:12:04,700
win the Nobel Prize and retire.

947
01:12:06,300 --> 01:12:10,100
I guess we're going.
I'll see you outside.

948
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:19,900
- I'm sorry. Tell her that.
- Yes.

949
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:28,600
Hey,

950
01:12:28,900 --> 01:12:31,300
we blew it, didn't we?

951
01:12:32,200 --> 01:12:34,300
I don't know, Raymond.

952
01:12:35,300 --> 01:12:37,600
It's hard to be smart.

953
01:12:38,500 --> 01:12:39,800
Yeah.

954
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:41,700
Bye-bye.

955
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:49,200
I don't care what anybody says.

956
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:53,500
I'm not going to end up like
one of those pan-scrubbers.

957
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:56,800
I'm getting the hell out of Stepford.

958
01:12:57,200 --> 01:12:59,800
I'll ask Dave tonight,
and we'll move.

959
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,500
Hey, hey, hey, you too.

960
01:13:02,700 --> 01:13:05,600
You can't break up a team like us.
We're the best thing to happen

961
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:07,900
since Laurel and Hardy.
Will you think about it?

962
01:13:08,200 --> 01:13:09,500
"Zoom.

963
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:12,300
"Zoot suit.

964
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:14,500
"Zulu."

965
01:13:16,900 --> 01:13:19,000
And that's that.

966
01:13:47,100 --> 01:13:49,200
I'm finally finished.

967
01:13:50,500 --> 01:13:52,300
When was that?

968
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:01,000
Walter, would you move?

969
01:14:04,100 --> 01:14:05,900
No, no.

970
01:14:07,200 --> 01:14:10,800
- What? What did I say?
- I meant move, leave Stepford.

971
01:14:13,400 --> 01:14:15,800
We just got to Stepford.

972
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,600
Hey, are you that unhappy?

973
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:23,000
Is it everything you expected?

974
01:14:23,800 --> 01:14:25,500
Well...

975
01:14:26,100 --> 01:14:27,800
No. No, it's not, but...

976
01:14:28,100 --> 01:14:29,800
...I just didn't want to be
the first one to admit it.

977
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,700
You know, I'm the one that wanted
to come here in the first place.

978
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,300
You think the men are dull.

979
01:14:35,500 --> 01:14:38,100
Well, I think the women are too.

980
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:41,200
You're right. I agree with you.
That's why I want to move.

981
01:14:41,500 --> 01:14:43,700
Yeah, but the area sure is nice,
though, you know.

982
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:45,900
It's perfect for the kids.

983
01:14:46,200 --> 01:14:49,800
Maybe Norwood or Eastbridge.

984
01:14:50,600 --> 01:14:52,000
OK, let's move.

985
01:14:53,500 --> 01:14:55,500
You mean it?
That's all there is to it?

986
01:14:55,800 --> 01:14:58,000
I just had to ask?
Shouldn't we fight or something?

987
01:14:58,300 --> 01:15:00,300
Well, I don't want
to move tonight, Joanna.

988
01:15:00,500 --> 01:15:05,200
What is it, June already? And I got
all this work piled up here. Jesus, I...

989
01:15:06,300 --> 01:15:07,600
OK, I'll tell you what.

990
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:09,700
Why don't you look around,
and we'll figure on moving in August.

991
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:13,300
That way, the kids can get settled in
before school starts.

992
01:15:15,300 --> 01:15:17,600
Hey, these papers are all
in sequence, you know.

993
01:15:17,800 --> 01:15:19,800
I mean, you're crushing
Mr Ziegler's will.

994
01:15:20,100 --> 01:15:21,500
I'll make you a beneficiary.

995
01:15:21,700 --> 01:15:23,600
I guess Mr Ziegler
can wait a little while.

996
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:25,800
- You mean it? We can move?
- Yeah.

997
01:15:26,300 --> 01:15:28,200
Oh, Walter.

998
01:15:29,300 --> 01:15:32,000
Oh, Walter, you're really sweet.

999
01:15:44,600 --> 01:15:48,200
Girls, I think after four houses,
I'm getting to know your taste.

1000
01:15:48,500 --> 01:15:50,300
This may be it.

1001
01:15:50,700 --> 01:15:56,500
He's an ITT VP transferred to
Panama, probably to start a revolution.

1002
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:06,800
There will be at least eight lonely ladies
in Eastbridge Centre for a while.

1003
01:16:07,200 --> 01:16:09,500
I don't know how he got away
with it so close to home.

1004
01:16:09,800 --> 01:16:11,700
- Oh, my.
- I'll go in first. You stay here.

1005
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:16,200
They gave me the key, but you
never know what you'll walk into.

1006
01:16:16,700 --> 01:16:20,200
Thanks. Oh, Mrs Kirgassa,
I love you.

1007
01:16:20,500 --> 01:16:23,700
Oh, she's fat and lovely.
She's got a big mouth, and I love her.

1008
01:16:24,100 --> 01:16:26,300
What a treat. When I told Dave
we were house hunting,

1009
01:16:26,600 --> 01:16:28,200
he nearly jumped out of his skin.

1010
01:16:28,500 --> 01:16:30,700
He threatened to cancel The Plaza.

1011
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,700
- What is The Plaza?
- Oh, I forgot.

1012
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,400
I'm supposed to ask you
if you will take our kids and the dog

1013
01:16:36,700 --> 01:16:40,900
so Dave and I can have a weekend,
our annual weekend, at The Plaza.

1014
01:16:41,200 --> 01:16:44,100
It's to commemorate the time
he took a young virgin to the theatre

1015
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:46,900
and faked her up to his room.

1016
01:16:47,200 --> 01:16:48,900
Hell, I had to lose it sometime.

1017
01:16:49,100 --> 01:16:52,500
- The coast is clear. Come on, girls.
- Right.

1018
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:55,200
- Anyway, will you do it for me?
- Do what?

1019
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:58,000
Take care of the kids and the dog
for the weekend.

1020
01:16:58,300 --> 01:17:01,800
Oh, I know it's just a horrible thing
to even think about, isn't it? Forget it.

1021
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:05,400
- No. Yes, it is, but OK.
- You will?

1022
01:17:05,800 --> 01:17:07,800
The girls at least
will love having the dog.

1023
01:17:08,100 --> 01:17:10,500
Ever since dear old Fred departed,
they've been after me

1024
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:13,100
- to get another one.
- Yes.

1025
01:17:13,400 --> 01:17:16,600
- I don't know about Walter, though.
- What do you mean?

1026
01:17:16,900 --> 01:17:19,400
Well, you know, Walter hates noise.

1027
01:17:19,700 --> 01:17:21,000
- I want one!
- Me!

1028
01:17:21,200 --> 01:17:25,100
The dog's under the table, for crying...
Hey, there's a dog under the table.

1029
01:17:25,500 --> 01:17:27,900
Honey, can I have
some more coffee, please?

1030
01:17:28,200 --> 01:17:30,500
Dolly is...
Dolly's under the table here.

1031
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:32,700
I wish you would...

1032
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,100
Can I have
some more coffee, please?

1033
01:17:35,800 --> 01:17:38,800
How many pancakes are you
gonna give...? Yeah, thank you.

1034
01:18:27,500 --> 01:18:29,900
- Joanna.
- Yeah?

1035
01:18:30,200 --> 01:18:34,000
Look, I played Monopoly with them.
I didn't pass go, I didn't collect.

1036
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:37,100
I played backgammon. I played
Scrabble with the goddamn kids.

1037
01:18:37,400 --> 01:18:39,200
They're in the kitchen now.
What do you want me to do?

1038
01:18:39,400 --> 01:18:43,700
Walter, you've had seven years
of college. Use your brain.

1039
01:18:44,100 --> 01:18:45,700
I'm sorry, but I'm onto something,

1040
01:18:45,800 --> 01:18:48,900
and I think maybe it's the best I've ever
done. And I wanna stick with it.

1041
01:18:49,300 --> 01:18:51,400
But how do I amuse them?

1042
01:18:51,700 --> 01:18:54,800
I amuse them seven days a week.

1043
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,900
They know all the
Sesame Street songs.

1044
01:18:59,500 --> 01:19:02,500
- Have a sing-along.
- A sing-along.

1045
01:19:03,100 --> 01:19:04,400
Jesus.

1046
01:19:05,900 --> 01:19:09,000
Mr Atkinson, I've been at these
since Saturday, just about nonstop,

1047
01:19:09,300 --> 01:19:12,400
because I had to get them into
some sort of shape for you to see

1048
01:19:12,700 --> 01:19:14,800
because I think
they're an improvement,

1049
01:19:15,100 --> 01:19:17,300
and you've got to think so too.

1050
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:20,900
I'm doing all the talking, I know,
but these are my little girls

1051
01:19:21,300 --> 01:19:24,200
and those are someone else's,
my best friend's little boys.

1052
01:19:24,500 --> 01:19:27,000
And you've just got to tell me,

1053
01:19:27,300 --> 01:19:29,600
am I crazy?

1054
01:19:30,200 --> 01:19:32,100
Aren't they good?

1055
01:19:32,700 --> 01:19:35,400
Please say something.
I don't care.

1056
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:37,800
No, I do care.

1057
01:19:38,100 --> 01:19:40,300
Don't say anything bad.

1058
01:19:41,100 --> 01:19:43,900
These are really quite good.

1059
01:19:44,200 --> 01:19:47,400
You're not saying that because you're
frightened I might be a crazy lady?

1060
01:19:47,800 --> 01:19:53,700
Clearly, you are a crazy lady,
but clearly, again, these are nice.

1061
01:19:54,100 --> 01:19:55,500
Wait a minute.

1062
01:19:55,900 --> 01:19:59,300
You said "good".
"Really quite good", you said.

1063
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:01,100
Good is better than nice.

1064
01:20:01,400 --> 01:20:02,700
You're not changing your mind,
are you?

1065
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
No. The results are lovely.

1066
01:20:05,300 --> 01:20:09,000
Don't get upset again.
Lovely is better than good.

1067
01:20:09,300 --> 01:20:12,200
But what fascinates me is,

1068
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:14,400
what is it you want from it all?

1069
01:20:14,900 --> 01:20:16,500
Do you know?

1070
01:20:17,400 --> 01:20:19,200
I want...

1071
01:20:19,700 --> 01:20:21,600
...somewhere...

1072
01:20:21,700 --> 01:20:24,200
...someday, someone to look
at something and say,

1073
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:27,000
"Hey, that reminds of an Ingles."

1074
01:20:27,300 --> 01:20:29,700
Ingles was my maiden name.

1075
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:32,800
I guess I want to be remembered.

1076
01:20:33,100 --> 01:20:34,900
Yeah, don't we all?

1077
01:20:35,100 --> 01:20:36,000
Bobby?

1078
01:20:36,300 --> 01:20:39,300
- It's me.
- Kitchen.

1079
01:20:40,600 --> 01:20:44,000
I've just come from Atkinson's
in New York, and he loves my stuff.

1080
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:47,900
Well, not loves, maybe, but he's
genuinely interested in my work.

1081
01:20:48,200 --> 01:20:49,900
The gallery for photographers.

1082
01:20:50,700 --> 01:20:52,400
That's wonderful, Joanna.

1083
01:20:54,100 --> 01:20:56,700
If you're going to tell me
you don't like this dress,

1084
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:58,600
I'm sticking my head
right in the oven.

1085
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:01,700
Dave bought it for me for the weekend.
He spent a ton on me.

1086
01:21:02,100 --> 01:21:04,100
How about the shape?

1087
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:06,800
Padded uplift bra.

1088
01:21:07,100 --> 01:21:09,700
It's true what they say in the ads.

1089
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,800
Oh, Joanna, Dave turned
me loose in Bergdorf's,

1090
01:21:13,100 --> 01:21:15,100
- and I went mad.
- Bobby.

1091
01:21:15,500 --> 01:21:18,300
At The Plaza, some guy tried
picking me up in the lobby.

1092
01:21:18,900 --> 01:21:21,600
You know how long it's been
since that happened?

1093
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:23,700
Of course, I did look terrific.

1094
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:27,400
Bobby, you're not at The Plaza now, so
why are you wearing all that makeup?

1095
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:30,100
You never even used to clean
your kitchen, much less wear makeup.

1096
01:21:32,600 --> 01:21:35,500
Admit it, Joanna, I was a joke.

1097
01:21:35,900 --> 01:21:39,500
Dave works hard all day long,
and what does he come home to?

1098
01:21:39,800 --> 01:21:43,100
- A slob.
- Bobby, it's gotten to you now.

1099
01:21:43,500 --> 01:21:44,800
Nothing's got me.

1100
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:49,400
I just want to look like a woman and
keep my house looking decent too.

1101
01:21:49,700 --> 01:21:52,700
- You're just like Charmaine.
- Will you stop?

1102
01:21:53,400 --> 01:21:55,200
And you're not going to leave
Stepford either, are you?

1103
01:21:55,400 --> 01:21:59,800
Leave Stepford?
Good schools, low taxes, clean air?

1104
01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:02,700
No. You're right.

1105
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:06,900
- Shall I make us a nice pot of coffee?
- No, no. I've really got to go now.

1106
01:22:07,800 --> 01:22:10,800
Stop by any time. I'll be here.

1107
01:22:44,300 --> 01:22:46,300
- Oh, my God, look out!
- Watch out!

1108
01:23:03,400 --> 01:23:07,200
OK, so you're upset. So you pass
a school bus, and you dent the wagon.

1109
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:08,900
Bobby Markowe buys a new bra,

1110
01:23:09,100 --> 01:23:11,400
and I gotta pay for a new mailbox
for the Van Sants.

1111
01:23:11,800 --> 01:23:14,600
So what? So, what are you
talking about, Joanna?

1112
01:23:14,900 --> 01:23:17,500
Why can't you understand?
Her kitchen was sparkling.

1113
01:23:17,700 --> 01:23:19,200
Yeah, so you said.

1114
01:23:19,500 --> 01:23:21,200
Look, I hate to come on
like the heavy,

1115
01:23:21,400 --> 01:23:23,000
but what's that got to do
with you going crazy?

1116
01:23:23,300 --> 01:23:25,200
It wasn't just that.
It wasn't just anything.

1117
01:23:25,400 --> 01:23:28,100
She's changed!
And stop telling me I'm crazy.

1118
01:23:28,500 --> 01:23:30,900
Are you two fighting?

1119
01:23:31,500 --> 01:23:34,000
- No.
- We don't like it when you fight.

1120
01:23:34,600 --> 01:23:37,700
Look, we're not fighting. We're just
talking. Now, come on, you guys.

1121
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,100
Go on outside, all right?

1122
01:23:42,300 --> 01:23:45,100
Oh, boy. This is really terrific.

1123
01:23:46,700 --> 01:23:48,900
This is really terrific for them,
you know.

1124
01:23:49,200 --> 01:23:52,700
Yeah, I remember when my mother
and father used to yell at each other.

1125
01:23:52,900 --> 01:23:55,600
- I didn't want them to go through this.
- Well, neither do I.

1126
01:23:55,900 --> 01:23:59,300
I'm sorry. I said I'm sorry about
the car, but I was panicked and upset.

1127
01:23:59,700 --> 01:24:02,500
Oh, look. That's no big deal.
It's the rest of it that bothers me.

1128
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:05,200
Just try to look at it
from my point of view, Joanna.

1129
01:24:05,500 --> 01:24:07,700
Walter, I just want to say
one thing to you.

1130
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
Bobby really has changed.
Believe me.

1131
01:24:10,200 --> 01:24:12,800
Everything in her house
looked like a TV commercial.

1132
01:24:13,100 --> 01:24:16,100
Well, good. Good.
She had to clean it sooner or later.

1133
01:24:16,500 --> 01:24:19,700
It looked like a goddamn pigsty.

1134
01:24:23,200 --> 01:24:25,800
I mean, when are things
gonna start sparkling around here?

1135
01:24:26,100 --> 01:24:27,400
That's what I'd like to know.

1136
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:31,400
I mean, just look at the way
my kids are dressed. Ragamuffins.

1137
01:24:31,900 --> 01:24:33,700
Jeez, I work 80 hours a week.

1138
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:37,500
I live in a great house, and my kids
look like they belong on welfare.

1139
01:24:42,100 --> 01:24:45,000
Look, if you paid a little more attention
to your family and a little less

1140
01:24:45,400 --> 01:24:48,200
- to your goddamn picture-taking...
- I'm getting the hell out of Stepford.

1141
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:51,800
I'm getting us a house now,
and if it's hard on you, tough.

1142
01:24:52,100 --> 01:24:53,400
And if it's hard on the kids,

1143
01:24:53,700 --> 01:24:56,700
I'll ease up on my goddamn picture-
taking and stay around the house,

1144
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:58,500
and believe me, they'll survive.

1145
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:01,200
That's what I'm talking about, Walter,
is surviving.

1146
01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:05,700
OK. All right.

1147
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,800
I mean, I'll take a loss
on this great house if I have to.

1148
01:25:09,100 --> 01:25:11,300
But there's one condition,
or we don't go anywhere.

1149
01:25:11,500 --> 01:25:14,400
You see somebody. You get
some help. You see a psychiatrist.

1150
01:25:14,900 --> 01:25:17,000
I'm fine.
I don't need to see anybody.

1151
01:25:17,300 --> 01:25:19,900
Yeah, well, you say you're fine,
but me, I'd like another opinion

1152
01:25:20,200 --> 01:25:22,400
because I'm not too anxious
to move to Eastbridge

1153
01:25:22,600 --> 01:25:25,100
and after four months there, be told
by my sweet wife we got to move again

1154
01:25:25,300 --> 01:25:29,400
because she doesn't like the way her
neighbours keep their houses clean.

1155
01:25:29,800 --> 01:25:34,400
Look, I'm not asking anything
unreasonable, and I don't like asking it.

1156
01:25:35,200 --> 01:25:38,100
But you want me to disrupt our lives
for the second time

1157
01:25:38,400 --> 01:25:41,200
in a couple of months
on some fixation you've gotten.

1158
01:25:41,900 --> 01:25:43,700
Now, that's the unreasonable part.

1159
01:25:43,800 --> 01:25:45,200
You've got to see that.

1160
01:25:53,300 --> 01:25:57,800
You and me,
we don't have to fight about this.

1161
01:25:58,400 --> 01:26:00,400
We're going to move.

1162
01:26:00,700 --> 01:26:03,300
It's only a few more weeks.

1163
01:26:10,100 --> 01:26:12,200
It doesn't have to be
anything dramatic.

1164
01:26:12,500 --> 01:26:15,600
There's a couple of topnotch guys
right here in town.

1165
01:26:15,900 --> 01:26:18,900
Just talk to one of them.
They'd see you.

1166
01:26:19,800 --> 01:26:22,300
But I wouldn't see them.

1167
01:26:23,200 --> 01:26:26,600
If I see anybody, I'll find my own.

1168
01:26:30,500 --> 01:26:33,900
I'm here at my husband's insistence.

1169
01:26:35,100 --> 01:26:39,200
We moved to Stepford with our
children, oh, a few months ago.

1170
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:42,200
Before that, we lived in Manhattan.

1171
01:26:43,100 --> 01:26:45,400
And now I want to move out.

1172
01:26:46,900 --> 01:26:50,500
You see, I have nothing
against the general area,

1173
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:54,900
but the women in Stepford just seem
to be on a different wavelength.

1174
01:26:55,200 --> 01:26:57,300
Well, that all seems
very straightforward.

1175
01:26:58,400 --> 01:27:01,600
And your husband wants you
to see me because...?

1176
01:27:03,100 --> 01:27:06,900
He feels I'm being irrational.

1177
01:27:07,900 --> 01:27:11,000
He says there's no certainty
I'd like Eastbridge

1178
01:27:11,200 --> 01:27:12,900
or someplace like that any better.

1179
01:27:13,900 --> 01:27:18,400
And he doesn't want to spend his life
moving from one house to another.

1180
01:27:19,500 --> 01:27:21,600
Yes, understandable,

1181
01:27:22,200 --> 01:27:26,700
but Stepford, I know,
has a reputation for being unsocial.

1182
01:27:27,100 --> 01:27:30,000
So I also understand
why you might be unhappy there.

1183
01:27:30,500 --> 01:27:32,700
I'd be unhappy there.

1184
01:27:33,100 --> 01:27:35,600
Any move is traumatic,
and a city-to-suburbs move

1185
01:27:35,900 --> 01:27:38,500
for a woman with interests
other than purely family

1186
01:27:38,700 --> 01:27:41,800
can seem like a jaunt to Siberia.

1187
01:27:43,100 --> 01:27:45,600
What would you think of
if I said Westport, Connecticut?

1188
01:27:49,400 --> 01:27:51,400
Writers, artists.

1189
01:27:51,700 --> 01:27:53,200
Now you have no reason
to know this,

1190
01:27:53,500 --> 01:27:56,800
but Truro, Massachusetts,
is this sort of elephant's graveyard

1191
01:27:57,200 --> 01:27:58,900
for psychoanalysts.

1192
01:27:59,100 --> 01:28:02,000
Perhaps Stepford is heaven
for the house-and-garden type.

1193
01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:04,800
One person tells another.

1194
01:28:06,200 --> 01:28:09,500
Some don't like it and leave.
Others that do like it, arrive.

1195
01:28:09,900 --> 01:28:12,900
I mean, Westport
didn't always have writers.

1196
01:28:13,500 --> 01:28:16,000
They didn't breed from an original pair.

1197
01:28:16,300 --> 01:28:17,700
I understand.

1198
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:21,400
Well, I'm not surprised.
You're obviously a very bright woman.

1199
01:28:43,100 --> 01:28:47,400
What does surprise me is that you
have come all this way to talk to me,

1200
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,300
and then you don't talk to me.

1201
01:29:20,900 --> 01:29:24,400
I think the men are behind it.

1202
01:29:25,600 --> 01:29:27,600
What men?

1203
01:29:27,900 --> 01:29:29,600
All of them.

1204
01:29:31,300 --> 01:29:34,000
All of them in the Association.

1205
01:29:38,900 --> 01:29:42,300
My husband, everyone.

1206
01:29:43,900 --> 01:29:46,300
The women don't...

1207
01:29:46,600 --> 01:29:49,300
Can't arrive in Stepford
loving housework.

1208
01:29:49,600 --> 01:29:53,000
They change once they get there.
I think the men make them change.

1209
01:29:54,200 --> 01:29:55,700
How would they do that?

1210
01:29:56,100 --> 01:29:58,500
I don't know. They...

1211
01:29:58,900 --> 01:30:00,300
They...

1212
01:30:03,300 --> 01:30:05,300
Oh, Jesus.

1213
01:30:05,800 --> 01:30:10,400
It's so awful.
If I'm wrong, I'm insane.

1214
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:15,000
And if I'm right,
it's worse than if I'm wrong.

1215
01:30:16,900 --> 01:30:19,000
I don't know what they do exactly.

1216
01:30:19,200 --> 01:30:23,300
They draw our pictures,
and they tape our voices.

1217
01:30:23,700 --> 01:30:26,600
And the women
all look neat and pretty.

1218
01:30:26,900 --> 01:30:28,800
There's a man.
He's a druggist.

1219
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:31,200
He runs the pharmacy.

1220
01:30:31,800 --> 01:30:33,500
And he's nothing.

1221
01:30:33,800 --> 01:30:37,800
He's nothing, but his wife
is just breathtaking.

1222
01:30:38,600 --> 01:30:41,600
And once, by mistake, I happened
to hear them making love,

1223
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:46,600
and she was carrying on incredibly,
like he was some kind of God's gift.

1224
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:50,100
And Charmaine changed in four
months and ripped up her tennis court.

1225
01:30:50,400 --> 01:30:53,000
And Bobby, my best friend,
changed in four months,

1226
01:30:53,200 --> 01:30:54,900
and that's what convinced me.

1227
01:30:55,100 --> 01:30:58,500
That's how long I've been
in Stepford. Four months.

1228
01:30:59,700 --> 01:31:01,100
And I don't know what's going on.

1229
01:31:01,300 --> 01:31:05,100
I just know something is wrong,
and my time is coming.

1230
01:31:07,600 --> 01:31:10,100
You're terribly frightened, aren't you?

1231
01:31:11,300 --> 01:31:13,300
Can you sleep?

1232
01:31:13,600 --> 01:31:15,500
Well, that's easy.
We can take care of that.

1233
01:31:15,700 --> 01:31:17,900
We'll see a lot of each other,
and you can talk some more.

1234
01:31:18,200 --> 01:31:21,000
See, it's unfortunate, but I have
to go away for a couple of days.

1235
01:31:21,400 --> 01:31:24,000
It's something I can't put off
at this short notice,

1236
01:31:24,500 --> 01:31:27,400
- but when I'm back, we'll talk.
- No.

1237
01:31:27,700 --> 01:31:29,500
No, you don't want to talk, or what?

1238
01:31:29,800 --> 01:31:32,600
I won't be here when you get back.
Don't you see?

1239
01:31:32,900 --> 01:31:34,600
It's going to happen before then.

1240
01:31:34,900 --> 01:31:37,500
Don't ask me to explain it.
I just know.

1241
01:31:37,700 --> 01:31:42,100
There will be somebody with my name,
and she'll cook and clean like crazy,

1242
01:31:42,500 --> 01:31:46,500
but she won't take pictures,
and she won't be me.

1243
01:31:46,900 --> 01:31:48,500
She'll...

1244
01:31:51,100 --> 01:31:55,300
She'll... She'll be like one
of those robots in Disneyland.

1245
01:32:05,900 --> 01:32:07,700
All right, now listen.

1246
01:32:07,900 --> 01:32:10,100
I'll give you a prescription,
which you'll have filled.

1247
01:32:10,400 --> 01:32:13,300
Then you gather up your children,
and you get the hell away.

1248
01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:15,200
Don't tell your husband.
Don't tell anyone.

1249
01:32:15,500 --> 01:32:17,400
Just go wherever you feel safe.

1250
01:32:17,700 --> 01:32:20,500
- Now, do you have family?
- They're dead.

1251
01:32:20,800 --> 01:32:23,300
Well, just drive and stop someplace,

1252
01:32:23,600 --> 01:32:25,400
and in a few days,

1253
01:32:25,700 --> 01:32:27,100
I'll be back on the 10th,

1254
01:32:27,200 --> 01:32:30,800
you ring me, I'll come to you,
and we'll sort this thing out.

1255
01:32:33,400 --> 01:32:35,500
Now, how does that sound?

1256
01:33:27,300 --> 01:33:29,300
They're not here.

1257
01:33:31,800 --> 01:33:34,300
- Where are they?
- I told you, they're not here.

1258
01:33:37,300 --> 01:33:39,200
They're with friends.
They're fine.

1259
01:33:39,400 --> 01:33:41,100
Amy?

1260
01:33:41,400 --> 01:33:43,200
Kim?

1261
01:33:45,200 --> 01:33:47,200
Which friends?

1262
01:33:49,200 --> 01:33:51,100
They're fine.

1263
01:33:52,300 --> 01:33:54,400
How was your visit?
Did she fix you up?

1264
01:33:54,800 --> 01:33:56,800
Walter, I'm taking the children away.

1265
01:33:57,100 --> 01:33:58,600
Where are they?
Are they at Bobby's?

1266
01:33:58,800 --> 01:34:00,800
Look. Just...
They're fine. I told you.

1267
01:34:01,100 --> 01:34:02,900
Look, we don't want you
to get upset again.

1268
01:34:03,100 --> 01:34:05,100
Now just go on upstairs
and lie down.

1269
01:34:05,400 --> 01:34:08,300
Don't talk to me like that. I don't want
to lie down. I want my children.

1270
01:34:08,700 --> 01:34:11,300
Joanna, go upstairs
and lie down now!

1271
01:34:11,600 --> 01:34:14,400
Don't tell me what to do,
you bastard!

1272
01:34:22,400 --> 01:34:24,700
- Joanna.
- Walter!

1273
01:34:31,900 --> 01:34:34,400
Joanna, open this goddamn door!

1274
01:34:45,100 --> 01:34:47,300
All right, you just stay in there, then.

1275
01:34:48,300 --> 01:34:50,300
You just stay in there.

1276
01:35:19,900 --> 01:35:24,000
Cornell call you? Yeah, yeah.

1277
01:35:24,700 --> 01:35:29,400
I had some trouble. I don't know,
but I think I handled it.

1278
01:35:33,100 --> 01:35:36,900
Yeah, yeah. Well, I don't know.

1279
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:43,800
I do not know,
but I think it's all right.

1280
01:35:44,100 --> 01:35:47,400
She's upset.
She's really upset.

1281
01:35:49,700 --> 01:35:52,100
She ran upstairs.

1282
01:36:01,600 --> 01:36:03,200
Yeah.

1283
01:36:03,800 --> 01:36:06,700
Well, she's in the room.

1284
01:36:07,700 --> 01:36:09,000
Yeah.

1285
01:36:09,300 --> 01:36:12,600
Yeah. I think it's...
I think it's all right.

1286
01:36:17,200 --> 01:36:19,400
Oh, Dis?

1287
01:36:20,100 --> 01:36:21,800
Well, what should I do?

1288
01:36:22,100 --> 01:36:23,500
Oh, I'll just...

1289
01:37:04,500 --> 01:37:07,200
Why, look at you,
for heaven's sakes.

1290
01:37:07,500 --> 01:37:09,100
Bobby. Bobby, listen.

1291
01:37:09,400 --> 01:37:11,600
You need a fresh-perked
cup of coffee.

1292
01:37:11,900 --> 01:37:14,300
I don't want any coffee.
I just want my children.

1293
01:37:14,500 --> 01:37:16,000
Well, they're not here.

1294
01:37:16,200 --> 01:37:18,800
Dave's working late,
so I shooed my boys off with friends

1295
01:37:19,100 --> 01:37:22,300
so I could give myself a chance
to do some real cleaning.

1296
01:37:22,700 --> 01:37:24,400
Who ever told you
Kim and Amy were here?

1297
01:37:24,500 --> 01:37:27,700
No one. No one, but the night
they changed you, I kept your kids.

1298
01:37:28,100 --> 01:37:29,600
It just seemed logical to me.

1299
01:37:29,800 --> 01:37:31,800
Changed me? What's that mean?

1300
01:37:32,100 --> 01:37:35,100
I don't know. I really don't.

1301
01:37:35,600 --> 01:37:39,100
Bobby, stop it! Look at me.
Say I'm right.

1302
01:37:39,400 --> 01:37:42,000
You are different.
Your figure's different, your face,

1303
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:45,000
what you talk about,
all of this is different.

1304
01:37:45,300 --> 01:37:49,200
Yes. Yes. This, it's wonderful.

1305
01:37:49,500 --> 01:37:52,000
Why don't you change your mind
and have a cup.

1306
01:37:52,400 --> 01:37:53,800
What does "archaic" mean?

1307
01:37:54,300 --> 01:37:55,800
- Archaic?
- Yes.

1308
01:37:56,100 --> 01:37:58,300
- I don't know.
- Think. You used to know.

1309
01:37:58,500 --> 01:38:00,700
When we went to Marie Axhelm's
and she was ironing,

1310
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:05,200
- she didn't know, but you did.
- Did I? Well, I forgot.

1311
01:38:05,600 --> 01:38:07,500
How do you want it?

1312
01:38:09,500 --> 01:38:14,300
- It wasn't on the word list, was it?
- This is a new blend and very mild.

1313
01:38:16,400 --> 01:38:18,700
- Do you take cream?
- Look, I bleed.

1314
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:23,500
- Oh, that's right. You take it black.
- When I cut myself, I bleed.

1315
01:38:25,400 --> 01:38:28,100
- Do you bleed?
- Why, look at your hand.

1316
01:38:30,900 --> 01:38:32,200
No, you look.

1317
01:38:33,300 --> 01:38:35,500
Joanna.

1318
01:38:47,900 --> 01:38:50,900
How could you do a thing like that?

1319
01:39:03,700 --> 01:39:06,600
How could you do a thing like that?

1320
01:39:11,700 --> 01:39:14,900
How could you do a thing like that?

1321
01:39:17,400 --> 01:39:20,600
When I was just going
to give you coffee.

1322
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:23,800
When I was just going
to give you coffee.

1323
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:27,600
When I was just going
to give you coffee.

1324
01:39:28,800 --> 01:39:30,900
I thought we were friends.

1325
01:39:31,200 --> 01:39:33,100
I thought we were friends.

1326
01:39:33,400 --> 01:39:35,800
I was just going to give you coffee.

1327
01:39:36,100 --> 01:39:38,400
I was just going to give you coffee.

1328
01:39:38,700 --> 01:39:40,400
I thought we were friends.

1329
01:39:40,700 --> 01:39:42,300
I thought we were friends.

1330
01:39:42,500 --> 01:39:44,100
I thought we were friends.

1331
01:39:44,400 --> 01:39:46,100
How could you do a thing like that?

1332
01:39:47,100 --> 01:39:48,800
I thought we were friends.

1333
01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:52,900
She must have sneaked out
when I was on the telephone.

1334
01:39:53,200 --> 01:39:55,400
Listen, Walter. It's gonna be OK.

1335
01:39:55,700 --> 01:39:59,200
The phones are jammed, the alarm
is out, and the roads are blocked off.

1336
01:39:59,500 --> 01:40:03,100
Everybody's out looking for her,
so don't panic.

1337
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:09,800
I'll be back, all right?

1338
01:41:51,800 --> 01:41:53,500
I want my children!

1339
01:41:55,800 --> 01:41:57,600
Where are they?

1340
01:41:57,800 --> 01:42:01,100
Where are they? Where are
my children? I want them.

1341
01:42:04,600 --> 01:42:06,100
Association.

1342
01:44:08,600 --> 01:44:10,500
Mommy?

1343
01:44:15,600 --> 01:44:17,400
Mommy?

1344
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:59,000
Mommy?

1345
01:45:08,300 --> 01:45:09,700
Mommy?

1346
01:45:18,600 --> 01:45:20,200
Mommy?

1347
01:45:21,700 --> 01:45:23,800
Mommy?

1348
01:45:24,100 --> 01:45:25,600
Mommy?

1349
01:45:27,900 --> 01:45:29,500
Mommy?

1350
01:45:31,300 --> 01:45:33,000
Mommy?

1351
01:45:33,800 --> 01:45:35,300
Hello, Joanna.

1352
01:45:35,600 --> 01:45:37,000
Mom...?

1353
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:41,000
Quite a lot of worry
you caused everybody.

1354
01:45:42,100 --> 01:45:44,300
Poor Walter is very concerned.

1355
01:45:47,900 --> 01:45:49,400
Where are my children?

1356
01:45:49,700 --> 01:45:52,600
The first time I met you,
I knew you were a good mother.

1357
01:45:52,900 --> 01:45:54,200
Well, they're quite safe.

1358
01:45:54,500 --> 01:45:56,700
Having a lovely
evening with Charmaine.

1359
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:58,800
She was thrilled to have them.

1360
01:46:04,700 --> 01:46:06,600
What have you got there?

1361
01:46:07,400 --> 01:46:10,100
Oh, no. No.
No, you're not gonna need that.

1362
01:46:10,400 --> 01:46:13,100
It's nothing like that at all.
You've got quite the wrong idea.

1363
01:46:13,400 --> 01:46:15,600
You've had the wrong
idea all the time.

1364
01:46:15,900 --> 01:46:17,400
It's nothing like you imagine.

1365
01:46:17,700 --> 01:46:20,500
Just another stage.

1366
01:46:20,700 --> 01:46:23,400
Think about it like that,
and there's nothing to it.

1367
01:46:25,400 --> 01:46:26,900
Why?

1368
01:46:27,200 --> 01:46:28,600
Why?

1369
01:46:30,900 --> 01:46:32,800
Because we can.

1370
01:46:35,300 --> 01:46:37,600
We found a way of doing it,
and it's just perfect.

1371
01:46:37,900 --> 01:46:40,400
It's perfect for us
and perfect for you.

1372
01:46:44,300 --> 01:46:45,900
You're a very good subject.

1373
01:46:46,200 --> 01:46:48,200
Perhaps the best we've had.

1374
01:46:48,500 --> 01:46:51,200
You were brighter than most.

1375
01:46:51,800 --> 01:46:54,400
Do you mind if I make a call?

1376
01:46:59,900 --> 01:47:02,400
See, think of it
the other way around.

1377
01:47:02,600 --> 01:47:05,700
Wouldn't you like some perfect stud
waiting on you around the house?

1378
01:47:06,100 --> 01:47:08,400
Praising you? Servicing you?

1379
01:47:08,700 --> 01:47:10,600
Whispering how your sagging flesh
was beautiful,

1380
01:47:10,900 --> 01:47:12,700
no matter how you looked?

1381
01:47:12,900 --> 01:47:14,900
Excuse me.

1382
01:47:15,500 --> 01:47:17,500
Everything's fine.

1383
01:47:18,500 --> 01:47:22,000
Just as I said.
Aren't I always right?

1384
01:47:23,100 --> 01:47:25,000
Yes, I'll take it from now.

1385
01:47:25,200 --> 01:47:27,100
Everybody can go home.

1386
01:47:30,800 --> 01:47:32,300
Well,

1387
01:47:32,600 --> 01:47:34,400
that's all there is.

1388
01:47:35,400 --> 01:47:37,300
So why don't we get it over.

1389
01:47:39,300 --> 01:47:41,900
You know, you hurried us a little.
We weren't quite ready for you,

1390
01:47:42,200 --> 01:47:43,900
if you want to know the truth.

1391
01:49:35,100 --> 01:49:36,900
Oh, no.

1392
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:47,100
Oh, God.

1393
01:50:54,300 --> 01:50:57,300
- Hi, Kit. How are you?
- Hello, Marie Ann.

1394
01:51:12,400 --> 01:51:13,900
Linda, what do you want?

1395
01:51:14,200 --> 01:51:16,100
I don't want to spend my
entire day in the supermarket.

1396
01:51:16,400 --> 01:51:18,300
Look, we live in a nice neighbourhood.

1397
01:51:19,900 --> 01:51:22,200
This is clean, safe.

1398
01:51:30,400 --> 01:51:32,200
Why don't you give it a chance.

1399
01:51:34,400 --> 01:51:37,200
- Hello, Marie.
- Hello, Charmaine.

1400
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:54,700
- Hi, Carol.
- Hi, Charmaine.

1401
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:13,400
- Hello, Carol.
- Hi, Pat.

1402
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:21,000
- Hi, Bobby.
- Hello, Carol. How are you?

1403
01:52:21,300 --> 01:52:22,900
Oh, I'm fine.

1404
01:52:51,700 --> 01:52:54,400
- Hello, Bobby.
- Hello, Joanna. How are you?

1405
01:52:54,800 --> 01:52:57,200
- Oh, I'm fine. How are you?
- I'm fine.

1406
01:52:57,500 --> 01:52:59,400
- How are the children?
- They're fine.

1407
01:52:59,600 --> 01:53:02,400
- And yours?
- Fine, fine.

1408
01:54:42,300 --> 01:54:44,200
