117
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:17,948
Take a right up there
to get to the big path.

118
00:12:18,119 --> 00:12:20,838
You better hurry. You'll miss
the drinks by the pool.

119
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,788

Then the palm tree chick died. . .

133
00:13:15,639 --> 00:13:18,870
. . .so she got promoted to palm tree.
Then Amy Aerobics died.

134
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:21,917
She's the new number one chick,
the new Amy Aerobics.

135
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:24,912
Amy Aerobics died?
What'd she die of?

136
00:13:25,079 --> 00:13:28,549
She didn't die of a fat ass,

What's up? Dude, don't be gay, man.

153
00:14:24,679 --> 00:14:26,635
At least assault
with a deadly wet one.

154
00:14:27,319 --> 00:14:29,708
-Who wants to limbo?
-Limbo, limbo, limbo.

155
00:14:34,479 --> 00:14:36,788
l'll show you the ropes
at the club tonight!

156
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:40,235
Look for me. l'll be the cute chick
behind the bar.

157
00:14:41,799 --> 00:14:43,869
Put some Frankie
back to Hollywood.

158
00:14:44,039 --> 00:14:47,395
Dude, whatever.
Dude, this is you! This is you!

159
00:14:47,559 --> 00:14:49,675
Build the high.
Bend it, don't break it.

160
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:53,070
-Don't bend anything.
-l'm getting so fucking laid tonight.

161
00:15:13,799 --> 00:15:17,075
Yeah, drink, sugar. Chug it down.
Chug it down for me.

162
00:15:18,319 --> 00:15:22,710
What's up, there, foxes and cockses?
Here comes Coconut Pete!

163
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:27,913
Hey, amigo.

164
00:15:28,119 --> 00:15:30,269
-You must be Lars.
-Coconut Pete.

165
00:15:30,439 --> 00:15:33,272
l appreciate you bringing
me into your life circle.

166
00:15:33,439 --> 00:15:36,636
Pleasure's all mine.

167
00:15:37,479 --> 00:15:40,039
-ls that a tranquility blouse?
-Yeah, it is.

168
00:15:40,199 --> 00:15:42,394
lt's the one you wore
on your album cover.

169
00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:44,629
Pink Crustaceans and Good Vibrations.

170
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:47,677
l read a 1 977 interview
where you said teal and blue. . .

171
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:49,716
. . .kept you focused in tough times.

172
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:52,308
That sounds like something
l said back in '77.

173
00:15:52,479 --> 00:15:56,028
l guess nobody told you you have
to wear the Pleasure Sweater. . .

174
00:15:56,199 --> 00:15:58,110
-. . .on luge duty.
-Yeah, they did. . .

175
00:15:58,279 --> 00:16:02,033
. . .but it's kind of hot in here
and it was wadded up on the ground--

176
00:16:02,199 --> 00:16:05,077
Just put the goddamn thing on.
Hank, give Lars a hand.

177
00:16:05,239 --> 00:16:07,275
Oh, yeah.

178
00:16:09,119 --> 00:16:11,075
-Thanks, Hank.
-Hey, Coco Pete.

00:16:11,239 --> 00:16:13,230
l have a present
for you, my friend.

180
00:16:13,599 --> 00:16:16,750
You see the beautiful flower
in the yellow dress?

181
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:19,871
-She's in full bloom.
-She said she saw you in Tucson. . .

182
00:16:20,039 --> 00:16:22,837
. . .three years ago, 1 4th row.

183
00:16:27,039 --> 00:16:30,475
Excuse me, but weren't you
at one of my shows?

184
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:34,029
-U of A, '99?
-Yeah!

185
00:16:34,199 --> 00:16:37,589
l remember you. You were in the--
Don't tell me. . .

186
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:40,273
-. . .fifteenth row.
-1 4th row!

187
00:16:40,479 --> 00:16:43,755
l have a pictographic memory
for pretty faces.

188
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:47,836
-Hey, how about the grand tour?
-Yeah, sure.

189
00:16:47,999 --> 00:16:49,955
Right this way.

190
00:16:52,759 --> 00:16:54,238
Hey, buddy!

191
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:57,828
Jesus Christ. That's tequila.

192
00:16:58,679 --> 00:17:02,115
l was doubles partners with
Andre Agassi for an entire week.

193
00:17:02,319 --> 00:17:05,038
l taught Dre to play cocks and quarters.

194
00:17:05,239 --> 00:17:09,073
lf you can believe it,
he'd never played cocks and quarters.

195
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:12,271
-That's interesting.
-Yeah, it's--

196
00:17:12,439 --> 00:17:14,907
Hey, snowbunny!
Give me a Drambuie, neat.

197
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:17,838
-You got it.
-All alone, huh?

198
00:17:18,039 --> 00:17:20,473
Don't worry.
No woman, no cry, right, man?

199
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:23,997
l was quite engaged until
you bullied your way in here.

200
00:17:24,159 --> 00:17:26,957
l heard you.
Something about cocks and quarters?

201
00:17:27,159 --> 00:17:30,310
We have that game here too.
lt's called ''hide the sausage. ''

202
00:17:30,519 --> 00:17:32,669
l beg your pardon? New fellow. . .

203
00:17:32,839 --> 00:17:34,909
-. . .please cut off this minor.
-Come on!

204
00:17:35,079 --> 00:17:38,151
lf there's grass on the field,
then play ball. Right?

205
00:17:38,359 --> 00:17:39,872
Hey, Sammy! Hit me!

206
00:17:44,279 --> 00:17:45,917
Gracias, sheriff.

207
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:48,035
Legalize it!

208
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:54,273
Late night fun at the campfire
in one hour. Don 't forget your condoms.

209
00:17:54,439 --> 00:17:56,589
Who wants some tequila?
Who wants some?

210
00:17:56,759 --> 00:17:59,910
What, are you dancing alone?
Sweetie, come here.

211
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,876
-Hi.
-Hi.

212
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:05,315
l now pronounce you
Mr. and Mrs. Funzy.

213
00:18:05,479 --> 00:18:07,674
You owe me one, bro.

214
00:18:07,839 --> 00:18:10,399
May l kiss the bride?

215
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:14,394
-Do you work here?
-l do.

216
00:18:14,639 --> 00:18:19,190
-l'm Juan Castillo. l am dive master.
-Like, cliffs or. . .?

217
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:23,511
Cliffs, rocks, boards,
whatever you wish.

218
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:26,390
That is a beautiful name. . .

219
00:18:28,639 --> 00:18:30,038
Penelope.

220
00:18:30,199 --> 00:18:34,750
-lt's breathtaking.
-Thank you.

221
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:39,118
So tell me, what brings you
here to us, Penelope?

222
00:18:39,399 --> 00:18:43,074
Oh, l'm on spring break.
l go to Oral Roberts.

223
00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:46,988
Oral Roberts? ls that anything like
an Anal Johnson?

224
00:18:47,199 --> 00:18:49,588
Because, well, l've done that
a few times.

225
00:18:49,999 --> 00:18:54,436
Or am l thinking of a Dirty Sanchez?
That's the one.

226
00:18:54,879 --> 00:18:59,236
-l don't know what that is.
-lt's not for you.

227
00:19:00,599 --> 00:19:04,592
-Oh, my God.
-Yes. A very magical place.

228
00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:22,399
-Hey.
-Hey, Carlos.

229
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:25,634
Make it quick,
we got a lot of dishes.

230
00:20:06,879 --> 00:20:08,995
Goddamn monkeys.

231
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:28,869
-Yu?
-Carlos, these knives are filthy.

232
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:30,757
When are you gonna clean them?

233
00:21:02,519 --> 00:21:04,714
One, two. One, two, three, four.

234
00:21:35,199 --> 00:21:37,155
Play ''Margaritaville. ''

235
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:43,669
-Excuse me?
-Play ''Margaritaville. ''

236
00:21:43,839 --> 00:21:46,273
l love that song!

237
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:49,676
l think you're referring to
my song ''Pina Coladaburg. ''

238
00:21:49,839 --> 00:21:52,512
No, ''Margaritaville. ''

239
00:21:55,159 --> 00:21:57,719
l think you mean ''Pina Coladaburg. ''

240
00:21:57,879 --> 00:22:00,916
A little song l wrote seven and
a half fucking years. . .

241
00:22:01,079 --> 00:22:03,832
. . .before ''Margaritaville''
was even on the map!

242
00:22:03,999 --> 00:22:08,595
Of course, you wouldn't know that,
because you weren't even born yet!

243
00:22:08,759 --> 00:22:11,512
-Come on, let's get a drink.
-l don't need this shit.

244
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:13,510
-Come on, man.
-Fuck that guy.

245
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:15,271
-Son of a son of a bitch!
-Yeah.

246
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:18,034
-Mother motherfucker!
-Yeah.

247
00:22:20,399 --> 00:22:22,549
Hey, Jenny.

248
00:22:25,479 --> 00:22:28,198
-Sorry.
-Give me a heads up before you do that.

249
00:22:28,359 --> 00:22:31,590
lt's a habit. l could see how tight
you were from a mile away.

250
00:22:31,759 --> 00:22:34,637
What can l say? Some girls are
just tighter than others.

251
00:22:37,759 --> 00:22:39,875
Sorry.

252
00:22:40,039 --> 00:22:43,190
So l guess l'm talking to a celebrity.

253
00:22:43,359 --> 00:22:44,997
l heard you got your own show?

254
00:22:45,159 --> 00:22:46,990
Yeah. Amy Aerobics. . .

255
00:22:47,159 --> 00:22:50,037
. . .accidentally ate some rat poison.
lt was awful.

256
00:22:51,439 --> 00:22:54,556
l'm still psyched.
l've been waiting a long time for this.

257
00:22:54,759 --> 00:22:57,398
-That's great.
-Hey, Jen.

258
00:22:58,759 --> 00:23:01,319
l will be glad to never have
to do this again.

259
00:23:01,519 --> 00:23:05,831
-lt must be tough living in paradise.
-You love it now, but just wait.

260
00:23:06,519 --> 00:23:10,353
Crab legs, crab legs. . . .

261
00:23:12,079 --> 00:23:15,071
Hey, you guys ever hear the story
of the Machete Maniac?

262
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:20,149
-Let's hear it!
-Yeah, l don't know. . .

263
00:23:20,319 --> 00:23:22,310
. . .it's probably too scary for you.

264
00:23:22,479 --> 00:23:24,913
-No, no, it's not!
-No, come on, Dave.

265
00:23:25,079 --> 00:23:28,116
-Please, tell us the story.
-All right, what the hell.

266
00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:31,998
This must have been,
like, 1 5 years ago.

267
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:35,276
We had a kid working at
the club named Phil Coletti.

268
00:23:35,439 --> 00:23:39,557
And one night,
a night a lot like tonight. . .

269
00:23:39,719 --> 00:23:43,792
. . .this gorgeous woman comes into
the club, asks him out to the jungle.

270
00:23:43,959 --> 00:23:45,438
He's like, ''Yeah, why not?''

271
00:23:45,639 --> 00:23:48,915
So they split. And as they start
getting out to the jungle. . .

272
00:23:49,079 --> 00:23:52,549
. . .further and further away
from the lights of the club. . .

273
00:23:52,719 --> 00:23:58,430
. . .she asks him if he believes
in the local legends of the island.

274
00:23:58,599 --> 00:24:01,067
Voodoo? Zombies?

275
00:24:02,039 --> 00:24:03,791
He's not too worried about it.

276
00:24:03,959 --> 00:24:07,315
He just rolls right over,
starts putting the screws to her.

277
00:24:07,479 --> 00:24:10,755
But something doesn't feel right
to Coletti.

278
00:24:10,919 --> 00:24:14,992
But he can't see shit, it's pitch-black,
so he just keeps banging away.

279
00:24:15,159 --> 00:24:17,719
But then, boom!
A flash of lightning. . .

280
00:24:17,879 --> 00:24:21,508
. . .lights up the whole island
and in that one moment. . .

281
00:24:22,039 --> 00:24:23,552
. . .he looks around and sees. . .

282
00:24:23,719 --> 00:24:26,313
. . .not only is he in
the old Mayan cemetery. . .

283
00:24:26,479 --> 00:24:30,392
. . .not only are the other guys from the
resort standing around watching him. . .

284
00:24:31,359 --> 00:24:33,634
. . .but he sees he's having sex
with a corpse.

285
00:24:35,399 --> 00:24:39,950
A cold, white,
dirty-from-the-grave dead body.

286
00:24:41,199 --> 00:24:47,434
And they say Phil Coletti calmly walked
to the groundskeeper's shack. . .

287
00:24:47,639 --> 00:24:49,277
. . .found a machete. . .

288
00:24:49,879 --> 00:24:53,758
. . .and chopped those staff members
into a hundred pieces.

289
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:57,548
And they say he took
that same machete. . .

290
00:24:57,719 --> 00:25:01,758
. . .chopped his own dick off
and ran screaming into the jungle.

291
00:25:01,959 --> 00:25:04,996
Nobody ever saw him after that.

292
00:25:05,159 --> 00:25:07,150
But from that point on. . .

293
00:25:07,319 --> 00:25:13,110
. . .Phil Coletti was forever known
as Machete Phil.

294
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:17,670
You're saying there's a totally deranged,
dickless dude running around out there?

295
00:25:17,839 --> 00:25:21,275
l'm saying l don't go
into the jungle alone if l can help it.

296
00:25:21,439 --> 00:25:24,715
Because you can hear him.
And l've heard him.

297
00:25:24,879 --> 00:25:26,790
Crying out:

298
00:25:28,679 --> 00:25:34,117
''Where's my penis?
Where's my penis?

299
00:25:34,279 --> 00:25:36,349
Where's my penis?''

300
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:42,828
And that boy was me!

301
00:25:50,759 --> 00:25:52,670
You're an asshole, Putman.

302

Anybody seen Rolo, Stacy or Kellie?

305
00:26:02,319 --> 00:26:04,275
They're probably screwing around
in the jungle.

306
00:26:04,439 --> 00:26:08,478
Shit. l'm gonna need somebody
to run Luau Night tomorrow.

People, please. ls it too much to ask?
Have sex with the guests.

313
00:26:27,439 --> 00:26:29,714
Some of them aren't bad-looking.

314
00:26:39,319 --> 00:26:41,549
Hola, Penelope.

315
00:28:07,079 --> 00:28:08,751
Change!

316
00:28:17,199 --> 00:28:18,632
All right, 200 points.

317
00:28:19,319 --> 00:28:21,514
-Move fast.
-Oh, you're dead, fucker.

318
00:28:21,959 --> 00:28:24,393
You little yellow prick!
You're fucked!

319

Five hundred points!

320
00:28:28,079 --> 00:28:32,118
-Fucking worm!
-A simple tag would have sufficed.

321
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:34,628
Eat it, fuck-nut!

322
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:38,988
Cue pretzel.
Where's pretzel?

323

Come on, cue pretzel.
Cue pretzel. Pretzel!

00:28:47,999 --> 00:28:51,514
Hey, pretzel! Get your twisted,

Ocupado, bro. Go.

00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:03,673
Switch off? Huh?

329
00:29:09,079 --> 00:29:11,195
Sorry, Cliff. l need you in the maze.

330
00:29:11,359 --> 00:29:14,396
-l'm on break.
-Be happy in your work, pear.

331
00:29:15,959 --> 00:29:18,154
Shit.

00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:24,788
-Hey, look, l salty.

333
00:29:24,959 --> 00:29:27,712

Hello?

338
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:39,992
Lars?

339
00:31:40,199 --> 00:31:44,397
Oh, sorry. l was just
in the middle of my Qi Kung.

340
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:46,709
Qi Kung?

341
00:31:47,759 --> 00:31:49,670
l should have you on my show.

342
00:31:49,839 --> 00:31:51,795
You're not just into
massage, are you?

343
00:31:51,959 --> 00:31:54,393
Yeah, well, l mean,
body work's still my life.

344
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:57,790
l've also done the Dianetic thing.
Spent time in the Forum.

345
00:31:57,959 --> 00:32:00,393
Did a little Falun Gong in Bang Chow.

346
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:02,789
-Know who's got a great philosophy?
-Who?

347
00:32:02,999 --> 00:32:04,352
Coconut Pete.

348
00:32:04,519 --> 00:32:06,111
Have a good time,
all the time. . .

349
00:32:06,279 --> 00:32:09,237
-. . .always eat the worm.
-Always eat the worm. Totally.

350
00:32:09,399 --> 00:32:11,310
-Sign our asses!
-Sign our asses!

351
00:32:11,479 --> 00:32:12,958
Sign our asses!

352
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:15,633
-What do you know about Fenshi?
-Nothing.

353
00:32:18,599 --> 00:32:19,998
The Snoring Panda.

354
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:22,434
Not to be confused with Linou Gano.

355
00:32:23,839 --> 00:32:27,468
The Leaking Turtle.
Don't try that in public.

356
00:32:27,759 --> 00:32:31,957
Hey, guys, l'm gonna send you back over
there. You'll get plenty of signatures.

357
00:32:32,119 --> 00:32:34,792
-Come on, hop.
-Go ahead.

358
00:32:34,959 --> 00:32:37,519
-Come on, hop.
-That's amazing.

359
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:39,635
lt's about connecting
your meridians.

360
00:32:39,799 --> 00:32:42,472
We have energy that flows
through us, connected by buttons.

361
00:32:43,079 --> 00:32:45,035
So, what other buttons
can you push?

362
00:32:45,199 --> 00:32:47,110
Tian-Tu.

363
00:32:49,999 --> 00:32:52,513
The Heaven Point.

364
00:32:52,959 --> 00:32:54,995
Fuck me.

365
00:32:55,639 --> 00:32:57,391
Damn.

366
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:00,514
Maybe l should take
you home with me.

367
00:33:00,679 --> 00:33:03,113
l don't know if l'd fit in your luggage.

368
00:33:03,319 --> 00:33:05,071
-Holy shit!
-What the--?

369
00:33:07,759 --> 00:33:09,829
-Carlos?
-What's he doing up in the air?

370
00:33:09,999 --> 00:33:13,230
-You're gonna be okay, dude.
-l'm not getting a pulse.

371
00:33:15,199 --> 00:33:16,837
''Naughty Carlos''?

372
00:33:18,879 --> 00:33:21,029
Who's driving the boat?

373
00:33:23,319 --> 00:33:24,957
You never played this game?

374
00:33:25,119 --> 00:33:28,998
We had a cheap Nicaraguan version
called ''Circle Eater. ''

375
00:33:29,159 --> 00:33:30,797
But, you know. . . .

376
00:33:32,759 --> 00:33:35,717
Trying to tell us something?
ls Timmy trapped in a well?

377
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:40,549
-You must come, quick!
-Follow the banana!

378
00:33:40,719 --> 00:33:43,836
Follow the banana
Follow the banana

379
00:33:43,999 --> 00:33:45,671
Follow the banana

380
00:33:46,919 --> 00:33:49,433
Oh, man!

381
00:34:03,439 --> 00:34:07,034
-Who would do something like this?
-Who would do something like this?

382
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:09,471
Come on. Just settle down.

383
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:13,709
-You're making a scene.
-There's a killer on the island.

384
00:34:13,879 --> 00:34:17,588
l know who it is. lt's Machete Phil.
Come out from the jungle.

385
00:34:17,759 --> 00:34:20,557
Cool it. That's just a bullshit
story for the guests.

386
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:23,187
Hey, hey, it looks like
everybody else is okay.

387
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:26,237
You gotta see what someone
did to my activities board.

388
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:30,478
Oh, my God!

389
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:34,427
-My God.
-Those mother--

390
00:34:37,919 --> 00:34:39,955
''Do your jobs and live.

391
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:42,394
Tell the guests and die. ''

392
00:34:42,559 --> 00:34:45,119
''Everybody's looking
to find their own paradise. ''

393
00:34:45,279 --> 00:34:48,237
-The hell's that mean?
-We have to get off the island.

394
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:50,867
We have to get
everyone off the island.

395
00:35:11,719 --> 00:35:13,038
Okay.

396
00:35:13,199 --> 00:35:15,269
Okay, the radio's smashed.

397
00:35:15,439 --> 00:35:17,589
-And we got no boats.
-No boats?

398
00:35:17,759 --> 00:35:20,796
-How could somebody steal both boats?
-l don't know.

399
00:35:20,959 --> 00:35:24,110
The Smiling Smuggler looked
like it was driving on its own.

400
00:35:24,279 --> 00:35:26,395
-On its own?
-Phone definitely been cut?

401
00:35:26,559 --> 00:35:29,631
-lt was not chewed up by jungle rats.
-We have jungle rats?

402
00:35:29,799 --> 00:35:33,155
-What are we gonna tell the guests?
-Nothing. You saw the board.

403
00:35:33,319 --> 00:35:36,834
He's right. We tell the guests
there's a maniac on the island. . .

404
00:35:36,999 --> 00:35:39,035
. . .we're gonna have
1 00 crazed maniacs.

405
00:35:39,199 --> 00:35:42,908
What about the sign on Cliff?
l mean, it clearly said ''Staff only. ''

406
00:35:43,079 --> 00:35:44,831
That means he's targeting us.

407
00:35:44,999 --> 00:35:47,274
-Fucking crazy.
-l don't understand.

408
00:35:47,479 --> 00:35:49,629
Why are they coming after us?

409
00:35:58,519 --> 00:36:02,558
When you're all done with your little
pink-panty meltdown, let me know. . .

410
00:36:02,719 --> 00:36:04,949
. . .because l'd like to get
down to business.

411
00:36:05,439 --> 00:36:09,318
l thought it was time
to bring in the pro.

412
00:36:09,479 --> 00:36:11,549
-Hank?
-Yes, Hank.

413
00:36:11,719 --> 00:36:13,630
The head of security on all my tours.

414
00:36:13,799 --> 00:36:17,553
So, what, he keeps aging hippies from
stealing the bong out of your bus?

415
00:36:17,719 --> 00:36:21,473
lt just so happens Hank used to be
a federal agent. Yeah, that's right.

416
00:36:21,639 --> 00:36:24,233
Head an FBl task force
on serial killers.

417
00:36:24,399 --> 00:36:27,550
Single-handedly caught
the Minneapolis Mangler.

418
00:36:27,719 --> 00:36:30,916
-Who's the Minneapolis Mangler?
-Exactly.

419
00:36:31,399 --> 00:36:34,436
You are aware that l have
served this guy 20 beers a day. . .

420
00:36:34,599 --> 00:36:38,672
-. . .for the last 1 0 years, right?
-Hey, l was in Nicaragua, junior!

421
00:36:38,839 --> 00:36:42,673
When you stuff your intestines back
in your pockets and walk 20 klicks. . .

422
00:36:42,839 --> 00:36:46,798
. . .after a knife fight with guerilla
drug lords, then you talk to me.

423
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:53,831
Since there's no way off this rock,
we're gonna have to catch this guy.

424
00:36:53,999 --> 00:36:58,311
We couldn't even catch the raccoon
that was stealing my wristbands.

425
00:36:58,479 --> 00:37:01,551
You didn't ask me to catch
the raccoon, did you, Pip?

426
00:37:02,599 --> 00:37:04,749
-Pip?
-All right, now, here's the plan.

427
00:37:04,919 --> 00:37:07,831
You're gonna give this wing nut
exactly what he wants:

428
00:37:07,999 --> 00:37:09,876
You're all gonna do your jobs.

429
00:37:10,039 --> 00:37:11,597
All right, tell us something.

430
00:37:11,759 --> 00:37:14,319
How the hell are we
supposed to do our job. . .

431
00:37:14,479 --> 00:37:18,154
. . .when somebody is killing the dick
out of everybody on the island?

432
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:20,150
Take it easy there,
menstrual cramp.

433
00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:23,551
You read the poem
on that board out there.

434
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:26,228
l seen this a million times.

435
00:37:26,399 --> 00:37:29,835
This guy's playing a game
and we're gonna play right back.

436
00:37:29,999 --> 00:37:33,196
Just keep cool
and this cat will come to us.

437
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:39,878
And when he does, l promise you,
l'll be there with my whomping stick.

438
00:37:48,279 --> 00:37:50,952
Come on, hit it! Hit it!

439
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:52,871
Definitely not this guy.

440
00:37:53,039 --> 00:37:55,633
Maybe.
Maybe not.

441
00:37:55,799 --> 00:37:58,108
What in the queen's wig
is going on here?

442
00:37:58,279 --> 00:38:01,794
We've got a killer on the loose,
you're throwing a pinata party.

443
00:38:01,959 --> 00:38:04,519
The cut on that pear kid
was left to right.

444
00:38:04,679 --> 00:38:08,513
Left to right! l'm looking
for the left-handed killer, you idiot.

445
00:38:08,959 --> 00:38:10,233
l see.

446
00:38:18,199 --> 00:38:21,635
This is totally fucked up.
l don't even know what l'm looking for.

447
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:24,188
l don't even know
what l'm doing here.

448
00:38:24,519 --> 00:38:27,158
l've been thinking about that poem
on the board.

449
00:38:27,319 --> 00:38:30,117
There's something really familiar
about those words.

450
00:38:30,279 --> 00:38:32,873
l just can't seem
to wrap my fingers around it.

451
00:38:33,039 --> 00:38:36,076
Can you wrap your fingers
around this?

452
00:38:43,319 --> 00:38:44,957
-Hi, Juan.
-Hey.

453
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:48,031
-Hey, hi, how are you?
-Good. l made you a hat.

454
00:38:48,919 --> 00:38:53,151
-l don't know what to say.
-Well, say thank you and put it on.

455
00:38:53,319 --> 00:38:55,150
All right, all right.

456
00:38:55,999 --> 00:38:58,354
Thank you. l love it.

457
00:38:58,519 --> 00:39:00,430
You wanna take a walk on the beach?

458
00:39:03,039 --> 00:39:07,112
You know, it's the same here
as it is down there, you know?

459
00:39:07,279 --> 00:39:09,554
Sand and water here. . .

460
00:39:09,719 --> 00:39:11,949
. . .sand and water--

461
00:39:15,159 --> 00:39:18,868
l heard you were being
very bad today, Juan.

462
00:39:19,039 --> 00:39:20,757
What do you mean?

463
00:39:20,919 --> 00:39:23,513
When you were supposed
to be in the maze. . .

464
00:39:23,679 --> 00:39:26,398
. . .you were eating watermelon.

465
00:39:26,559 --> 00:39:31,189
-How did you find out about that?
-Because l see everything, Juan.

466
00:39:37,559 --> 00:39:40,073
You know--? You know what?

467
00:39:40,239 --> 00:39:45,518
l think it's a good idea if we were to go
down the beach a little more far.

468
00:39:46,799 --> 00:39:48,710
The two of us.

469
00:39:48,879 --> 00:39:50,597
Okay.

470
00:39:56,999 --> 00:40:01,595
Oh, you know, l forgot.
l'm supposed to go make s'mores!

471
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:08,436
-We checked every guest cabana.
-No weapons? Bloody clothes?

472
00:40:08,599 --> 00:40:10,908
Just pornography
and a load of condoms.

473
00:40:11,079 --> 00:40:14,196
-The guy in 1 4 had a wooden Bible.
-Wooden Bible, huh?

474
00:40:14,359 --> 00:40:16,236
That's good, that's a good job.

475
00:40:16,399 --> 00:40:19,391
All right, Jenny, you go
check on Yu. She's freaking out.

476
00:40:19,559 --> 00:40:21,595
New meat, you take over here.
Okay?

477
00:40:21,759 --> 00:40:23,397
Break.

478
00:40:23,559 --> 00:40:26,517
-You'll be all right?
-Yeah.

479
00:40:26,679 --> 00:40:28,192
Sure.

480
00:40:32,879 --> 00:40:34,232
Shite.

481
00:40:34,399 --> 00:40:35,957
Shite.

482
00:40:36,119 --> 00:40:37,711
Not her best.

483
00:40:37,879 --> 00:40:40,188
Hello, Pete.

484
00:40:41,039 --> 00:40:45,112
''Hope They've Got
Hammocks in Heaven. ''

485
00:40:45,319 --> 00:40:47,071
Great.

486
00:40:47,399 --> 00:40:49,833
And again, Peter.

487
00:40:50,439 --> 00:40:52,395
You dirty bugger.

488
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:01,637
What's this?

489
00:41:06,039 --> 00:41:08,234
This is crazy.
We can't do this anymore!

490
00:41:08,399 --> 00:41:10,355
Quiet, Yu.
The guests will hear!

491
00:41:10,519 --> 00:41:14,194
We cannot act like there's nothing
wrong. There are guests everywhere.

492
00:41:14,359 --> 00:41:17,874
-We have to tell them.
-No! You saw that board.

493
00:41:28,039 --> 00:41:31,793
-l said, ''Totally tea bag season. ''
-Shut up, gay-rod. Give me a light.

494
00:41:31,959 --> 00:41:35,349
l need you back at the bonfire.
We're gonna make an announcement.

495
00:41:35,519 --> 00:41:37,749
Good, l got an announcement
to make to Roy.

496
00:41:37,919 --> 00:41:39,955
l'm totally bake-ached.

497
00:41:40,119 --> 00:41:41,393
What?

498
00:41:41,559 --> 00:41:43,436
ldiots.

499
00:41:45,719 --> 00:41:47,357
Hey, come to the beach.

500
00:41:47,519 --> 00:41:49,191
We're gonna make
an announcement.

501
00:41:56,039 --> 00:41:57,631
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

502
00:42:12,959 --> 00:42:16,076
There's always
one fuckhead like you. . .

503
00:42:16,239 --> 00:42:18,309
. . .trying to shit in the apple pie.

504
00:42:19,399 --> 00:42:23,187
Well, you just shat in the one apple pie
that knows how to shit back.

505
00:42:24,159 --> 00:42:26,753
So why don't you and me, let's just--

506
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:36,037
Oh, my God!

507
00:42:55,399 --> 00:42:56,912
Shit!

508
00:43:12,999 --> 00:43:15,832
Amy's got some fantastic advice
for everybody.

509
00:43:15,999 --> 00:43:19,548
Here are humans, here is God
and here are we.

510
00:43:19,719 --> 00:43:21,789
You're the girl, Ame!

511
00:43:22,799 --> 00:43:24,755
Shoulders down.

512
00:43:24,919 --> 00:43:27,353
-How are we looking?
-You're looking fantastic!

513
00:43:27,519 --> 00:43:30,397
You're looking fantastic.
This is one of the top five--

514
00:44:05,959 --> 00:44:08,314
Let's do the sun salute!

515
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:11,312
Crab, crab, crab, shot,
throw it away, salute!

516
00:44:11,479 --> 00:44:14,516
Crab, crab, crab, shot,
throw it away, salute!

517
00:44:14,679 --> 00:44:17,671
Hey, let's dance!
lt's easier when you're smiling.

518
00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:21,036
-l heard one of our ski boats last night.
-Shit! That's great!

519
00:44:21,199 --> 00:44:24,635
-l heard it for a second--
-lf it's one of ours, this guy's got it.

520
00:44:24,799 --> 00:44:28,474
Not a good idea to look for it unless
you want your dinghy chopped off.

521
00:44:28,639 --> 00:44:29,913
What?

522
00:44:34,599 --> 00:44:35,873
l figured it out.

523
00:44:36,039 --> 00:44:38,507
l know where those lines
on the board came from.

524
00:44:38,679 --> 00:44:42,194
You know that line ''Everyone's
looking to find their own paradise''?

525
00:44:42,359 --> 00:44:45,476
-That's from one of your songs.
-One of my songs?

526
00:44:45,639 --> 00:44:48,915
Yeah, it's off your album
Sea Shanties and Wet Panties.

527
00:44:49,079 --> 00:44:50,432
1 978?

528
00:44:50,599 --> 00:44:52,317
Let's see those pincers, people!

529
00:44:52,479 --> 00:44:54,549
What does the song
have to do with this?

530
00:44:54,719 --> 00:44:57,597
The name of the song
is ''Naughty Cal. ''

531
00:44:57,759 --> 00:45:00,671
-''Naughty Cliff,'' ''Naughty Carlos. ''
-''Naughty Cal. ''

532
00:45:01,519 --> 00:45:04,750
Naughty Cal
Bongo and Tokey

533
00:45:04,919 --> 00:45:07,672
Got tired of living on land

534
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:11,309
So the three amigos
Took an undersea trip

535
00:45:11,479 --> 00:45:14,073
And never were seen again

536
00:45:15,079 --> 00:45:17,832
Bongo the stoned crab
Got high as a kite

537
00:45:17,999 --> 00:45:19,910
Fell and cracked his shell

538
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:22,957
Shit, that's the line that
was on the board yesterday.

539
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:31,751
l didn't know where it was from.

540
00:45:31,919 --> 00:45:34,149
How do you not know
the words to your song?

541
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:37,948
l don't even remember
making the album. Okay?

542
00:45:38,119 --> 00:45:41,509
Shit, it was '78.
We were all out of our gourds.

543
00:45:41,679 --> 00:45:45,831
lt was kind of crazy times in 1 978.

544
00:45:45,999 --> 00:45:48,718
Oh, man, we had
some fucking parties.

545
00:45:48,879 --> 00:45:51,996
Bongo the stoned crab
Got high as a kite

546
00:45:52,159 --> 00:45:55,071
And fell and cracked his shell

547
00:45:55,439 --> 00:45:58,351
Tokey was lost in a maze all night

548
00:45:59,039 --> 00:46:01,473
''High as a kite till he fell
and cracked his shell. ''

549
00:46:01,639 --> 00:46:04,472
That's like Carlos up in the parasail!

550
00:46:04,879 --> 00:46:06,676
Then ''Lost in a maze. ''

551
00:46:06,839 --> 00:46:08,238
Exactly like Cliff!

552
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:14,395
So this guy's killing people
according to an acid trip song?

553
00:46:14,559 --> 00:46:17,790
-This is insane.
-Peter, what's the song about?

554
00:46:17,959 --> 00:46:21,156
ls there some sort of
special significance?

555
00:46:21,319 --> 00:46:22,798
Fuck, no. l mean--

556
00:46:22,959 --> 00:46:24,711
l don't know, it's a sea shanty.

557
00:46:24,879 --> 00:46:27,439
And Naughty Cal's this
underwater cowboy.

558
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:29,908
And Tokey and Bongo
are his buddies. . .

559
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:33,833
. . .and they go on this adventure
to find Atlantis or some shit.

560
00:46:33,999 --> 00:46:36,672
Let's listen to the next line,
see what happens.

561
00:46:42,279 --> 00:46:44,474
Maybe if l play it backwards.

562
00:46:49,159 --> 00:46:51,832
-Mango bay
-Wait, listen.

563
00:46:51,999 --> 00:46:54,991
But a big, bad orca
And the scary octopus

564
00:46:55,159 --> 00:46:57,798
Were guarding the riverbed

565
00:46:58,799 --> 00:47:01,233
So, what the hell?
''The orca and the octopus''?

566
00:47:01,399 --> 00:47:03,959
ls it the next victims?
Or is it the killer?

567
00:47:04,119 --> 00:47:07,794
Our lives depend on us interpreting
the dumbest song l've ever heard.

568
00:47:07,959 --> 00:47:11,395
Don't hold back. Say what you
really think. l'm not sensitive.

569
00:47:11,559 --> 00:47:14,631
l won about five fucking
gold records in my lifetime.

570
00:47:14,799 --> 00:47:17,154
How many gold records do you have?

571
00:47:18,319 --> 00:47:19,593
Let's see how it ends.

572
00:47:19,759 --> 00:47:24,469
Everybody's looking
To find their own paradise

573
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:27,316
But it ain 't on Earth

574
00:47:27,479 --> 00:47:29,231
It's up there in heaven

575
00:47:29,399 --> 00:47:33,438
And someday
We're all gonna die

576
00:47:35,479 --> 00:47:37,674
-Jesus.
-Pete!

577
00:47:37,839 --> 00:47:39,477
Yu and Hank are dead.

578
00:47:39,639 --> 00:47:41,630
-Why? What did we do?
-No, man.

579
00:47:41,799 --> 00:47:44,359
Yu and Hank are fucking dead.

580
00:47:44,519 --> 00:47:45,793
You threatening me?

581
00:47:45,959 --> 00:47:48,029
Because if you are,
you hairless lapdog--

582
00:47:48,199 --> 00:47:50,030
Just come and look!

583
00:47:52,839 --> 00:47:54,875
''Don't let this be Yu. ''

584
00:47:55,039 --> 00:47:58,236
She was just trying
to warn the guests.

585
00:47:58,999 --> 00:48:00,273
Hank.

586
00:48:03,479 --> 00:48:04,753
Yu.

587
00:48:19,359 --> 00:48:20,951
Why are we doing
a fashion show?

588
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:23,587
Because it's Fashion Show Wednesday,
that's why!

589
00:48:23,759 --> 00:48:27,434
Look what happened to Yu! Remember
the warning, ''Do your jobs or die''?

590
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:31,592
We're gonna put smiles on our faces
and march out there and do our jobs.

591
00:48:31,759 --> 00:48:33,989
-Lars, you're up. Come on.
-You got it.

592
00:48:38,119 --> 00:48:40,155
Lars Brunckhorst, everybody.

593
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:43,519
Lars is sporting the Pleasure Poncho.

594
00:48:43,679 --> 00:48:47,558
Only $ 1 9.95 at the gift shop.
Thank you, Lars.

595
00:48:47,719 --> 00:48:49,630
I got a bad feeling
about the new guy.

596
00:48:50,119 --> 00:48:52,679
You are right.
lt all started when he got here.

597
00:48:52,839 --> 00:48:54,830
Sam, it isn't Lars or any of us.

598
00:48:54,999 --> 00:48:57,069
Look, l know why
you're defending him.

599
00:48:57,239 --> 00:48:59,036
Pajamas!
Come on, move! Come on!

600
00:48:59,199 --> 00:49:02,953
-Putman, pillow.
-Putman Livingstone, l presume.

601
00:49:03,279 --> 00:49:06,157
Oh, if it isn't Little Lord Fauntleroy!

602
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:08,071
Pip, Pip, tallyho!

603
00:49:08,239 --> 00:49:09,592
l got it.

604
00:49:09,759 --> 00:49:13,832
ln that song, Naughty Cal
sings about the scary octopus.

605
00:49:13,999 --> 00:49:18,390
Look at Putman!
Putman is the octopus. Hello?

606
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:21,153
Dave, just go play
with the curtains or something.

607
00:49:21,319 --> 00:49:24,197
We can't dismiss that song.
What about Carlos and Cliff?

608
00:49:24,359 --> 00:49:28,432
What about the fact Hank was buried in
the sand like the treasure in the song?

609
00:49:28,599 --> 00:49:32,387
All right, so maybe the octopus
is the way the next person dies?

610
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:34,629
How do you kill someone
with an octopus?

611
00:49:34,799 --> 00:49:37,359
Octopus spelled backwards
is ''supotco. ''

612
00:49:37,519 --> 00:49:40,113
-lsn't that Spanish for something?
-''Supotco''? No.

613
00:49:40,279 --> 00:49:42,474
-The word for shoe is zapato.
-Shoe.

614
00:49:42,639 --> 00:49:46,268
Am l the only one who thinks
his head looks like an octopus?

615
00:49:46,439 --> 00:49:48,794
-Here he comes.
-What did l miss?

616
00:49:48,959 --> 00:49:51,519
Apparently somebody's gonna
get killed by a shoe.

617
00:49:51,919 --> 00:49:55,275
lnstead of focusing on the song,
why don't we look for the boats?

618
00:49:55,439 --> 00:49:57,634
-Good idea.
-Jenny, why don't you and l. . .

619
00:49:57,799 --> 00:50:00,233
. . .go search together?

620
00:50:00,399 --> 00:50:03,277
Putman, why don't you
and l go and look for that boat?

621
00:50:03,439 --> 00:50:07,591
Are you daft? l'm not going out in the
jungle with you and your bloody shiatsu.

622
00:50:07,759 --> 00:50:10,876
lf you're the killer,
you'll snap my neck like a twig.

623
00:50:11,159 --> 00:50:14,037
Stick to the shore.
No reason to go in the jungle.

624
00:50:14,719 --> 00:50:17,153
The boats are gonna
be covered with sticks.

625
00:50:17,319 --> 00:50:20,994
-Or branches.
-Oh, thanks much, officer.

626
00:50:21,719 --> 00:50:23,835
Aren't you taking any weapons?

627
00:50:23,999 --> 00:50:26,115
l have all the weapons l need.

628
00:50:26,279 --> 00:50:29,635
Piss on that! l'm taking a machete.

629
00:50:30,159 --> 00:50:32,070
Thanks for doing this, Lars.

630
00:50:32,239 --> 00:50:35,117
You're very brave.
But just be careful, all right?

631
00:50:45,519 --> 00:50:47,794
Good luck, Putman.

632
00:50:50,399 --> 00:50:54,278
Better believe l'll be keeping
an eye on you, Mr. Miyagi.

633
00:51:06,759 --> 00:51:10,035
You're probably intimidated
by cooking for the whole resort. . .

634
00:51:10,199 --> 00:51:13,111
. . .but l think you're gonna
get a big kick out of it.

635
00:51:14,599 --> 00:51:17,955
l bet you watched Yu and Kellie
and most of it is common sense.

636
00:51:18,119 --> 00:51:21,953
Like right now, l'm making my
famous Coconut Pete's paella.

637
00:51:22,399 --> 00:51:24,549
Can anyone guess the secret ingredient?

638
00:51:25,959 --> 00:51:27,392
Come on.

639
00:51:27,839 --> 00:51:30,148
Coconut Pete's paella?

640
00:51:31,319 --> 00:51:33,150
The secret ingredient?

641
00:51:33,799 --> 00:51:35,994
Coconut Pete?

642
00:51:37,399 --> 00:51:40,152
-Coconut?
-Yes, goddamn it! Yes!

643
00:51:40,679 --> 00:51:42,670
Yes!

644
00:51:45,359 --> 00:51:49,477
Jesus, you think Eddie Money
has to put up with this shit?!

645
00:51:53,239 --> 00:51:56,037
Goddamn it! Coconut paella!

646
00:51:57,039 --> 00:51:59,712
Jesus Christ.
What do you think?

647
00:52:00,319 --> 00:52:03,834
Pete's under a lot of pressure.
l don't think we can say for sure.

648
00:52:03,999 --> 00:52:05,955
-l don't know.
-What are you doing?

649
00:52:06,359 --> 00:52:10,068
You know, just hanging around,
looking through the window.

650
00:52:10,239 --> 00:52:11,592
Calamari?

651
00:52:14,679 --> 00:52:16,749
lt's an aphrodisiac, Juan.

652
00:52:20,599 --> 00:52:24,478
What's wrong? You're not afraid
of a little octopus, are you?

653
00:52:28,319 --> 00:52:29,798
When you're done here. . .

654
00:52:29,959 --> 00:52:32,189
. . .l want you to come
inside and find me. . .

655
00:52:32,359 --> 00:52:35,396
. . .because l wanna wrap my
little tentacles around you.

656
00:52:35,839 --> 00:52:37,670
Okay.

657
00:52:45,799 --> 00:52:47,198
No way.

658
00:52:50,479 --> 00:52:52,913
Think about it. The octopus.

659
00:52:53,079 --> 00:52:55,468
She's a weird little chick,
l'll give you that.

660
00:52:55,639 --> 00:52:58,517
Look, it still doesn't
prove that she's the killer.

661
00:52:59,479 --> 00:53:00,832
All right.

662
00:53:00,999 --> 00:53:03,638
Then there is only one way to find out.

663
00:53:09,799 --> 00:53:11,630
Don't be nervous.

664
00:53:14,159 --> 00:53:17,868
l just want our first time
to be wonderful.

665
00:53:20,279 --> 00:53:24,989
So l would say that if you're the killer,
you know, just maybe don't kill me.

666
00:53:25,159 --> 00:53:27,389
Or at least make it,
you know, painless.

667
00:53:27,559 --> 00:53:31,313
With those moves, l bet you could
put me down nice and easy. l'm out.

668
00:53:31,479 --> 00:53:35,631
The reason we're hiding in this closet
is because we think she's the killer.

669
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:38,673
-Yeah, not too hard, l hope.
-l really like Juan.

670
00:53:38,839 --> 00:53:41,399
When we first met, l was like,
''Who is this guy?

671
00:53:41,559 --> 00:53:43,709
Some local guy coming
down here and--''

672
00:53:50,439 --> 00:53:53,033
l haven't been entirely
honest with you.

673
00:53:53,199 --> 00:53:58,068
You mean you don't really
go to the Oral Roberts?

674
00:54:14,559 --> 00:54:20,395
l mean l just wanted to leave my
past behind me when l came here.

675
00:54:20,559 --> 00:54:23,631
What the fuck are you,
a praying-mantis woman?

676
00:54:28,119 --> 00:54:32,590
God! l have never
been to a place like this.

677
00:54:32,759 --> 00:54:34,715
l mean, it's just so free.

678
00:54:35,559 --> 00:54:40,349
Juan, l have spent
my whole life in a gym.

679
00:54:41,319 --> 00:54:43,753
l just wanted to party
like everyone else.

680
00:54:45,039 --> 00:54:48,714
My coach, Orgrav,
would kill me if he found out.

681
00:54:48,879 --> 00:54:52,269
He would hunt me down
like a deranged lunatic.

682
00:54:52,919 --> 00:54:55,956
-He's really scary some--
-Wait, wait.

683
00:54:56,719 --> 00:54:57,993
You are a gymnast?

684
00:54:59,559 --> 00:55:00,833
Yeah.

685
00:55:06,399 --> 00:55:08,913
-Oh, Juan.
-Penelope.

686
00:55:09,079 --> 00:55:11,547
No, no!

687
00:55:11,719 --> 00:55:13,710
-No!
-Oh, Juan!

688
00:55:37,039 --> 00:55:39,599
l'll be right back.

689
00:55:43,079 --> 00:55:45,195
Okay.

690
00:55:49,319 --> 00:55:54,074
l'm still not sure. l may need a few
more hours to pump her for information.

691
00:55:54,279 --> 00:55:55,871
You're just trying to get laid.

692
00:55:56,039 --> 00:55:58,792
Would you like to be in this closet
while l have sex?

693
00:55:58,999 --> 00:56:01,354
That is a great idea.

694
00:56:02,319 --> 00:56:04,071
Here she comes.

695
00:56:10,319 --> 00:56:14,153
What exactly are your
intentions with Jenny?

696
00:56:18,519 --> 00:56:23,388
You know, Put, during the Sung dynasty
there was a great mystic. . .

697
00:56:23,559 --> 00:56:28,713
. . .Master Tsu Tong Po.
And he once said something very wise:

698
00:56:28,919 --> 00:56:32,673
''lf you love something, set it free.
lf it comes back to you--''

699
00:56:32,839 --> 00:56:35,672
Fuck off, it's a bloody Hallmark card.

700
00:56:36,999 --> 00:56:38,751
Just trying to help you, man.

701
00:56:39,959 --> 00:56:43,713
Well, she has taken quite
a fancy to you, hasn't she?

702
00:56:43,879 --> 00:56:48,111
But l have some ammunition
of my own.

703
00:56:50,399 --> 00:56:54,631
What kind of man would l be if l sat
idly by while you stole her from me?

704
00:56:59,999 --> 00:57:03,833
Do not underestimate me, Lars.

705
00:57:06,959 --> 00:57:09,393
l know things you don't.

706
00:57:39,399 --> 00:57:42,038
All right, Lars,
let's see what you've got.

707
00:57:52,279 --> 00:57:54,349
Look what l found.

708
00:57:54,519 --> 00:57:58,228
Yeah. Shiny.

709
00:58:09,559 --> 00:58:11,151
Hey.

710
00:58:19,479 --> 00:58:21,435
l knew it.

711
00:58:23,719 --> 00:58:25,949
Sick fuck.

712
00:58:26,159 --> 00:58:28,593
Dear God in heaven.

713
00:58:37,159 --> 00:58:38,831
Lars?

714
00:58:42,199 --> 00:58:44,269
Oh, dear God.

715
00:59:09,239 --> 00:59:11,309
No!

716
00:59:11,479 --> 00:59:13,709
No!

717
00:59:29,559 --> 00:59:32,232
-You?
-That's right, love.

718
00:59:32,399 --> 00:59:36,108
Now, take that stupid bag
off your head and give us a kiss.

719
00:59:37,839 --> 00:59:41,434
-What?
-Advantage, Putman.

720
00:59:45,719 --> 00:59:47,232
Putman.

721
00:59:47,599 --> 00:59:50,352
Putman, wake up, Putman.

722
00:59:50,559 --> 00:59:53,949
Putman, it's a dream.
lt's just a dream, Putman.

723
01:00:02,519 --> 01:00:04,749
Farewell.

724
01:00:06,919 --> 01:00:08,875
Keep it clean, keep it clean, mister.

725
01:00:09,079 --> 01:00:11,354
That's a point. That's a point.

726
01:00:12,159 --> 01:00:13,956
Mira, a boat.

727
01:00:20,879 --> 01:00:23,552
He found the fucking boat.

728
01:00:26,519 --> 01:00:29,352
Hang on to your kudos.

729
01:00:30,999 --> 01:00:33,718
-She's not going anywhere.
-What did you do to the propeller?

730
01:00:33,919 --> 01:00:36,672
Nothing. This is the one
that was pulling Carlos.

731
01:00:36,839 --> 01:00:40,673
We could send a group to paddle to the
mainland. We've got plenty of guys.

732
01:00:40,839 --> 01:00:42,272
No chance.

733
01:00:43,199 --> 01:00:45,554
The riptide'll take you out to sea.

734
01:00:45,719 --> 01:00:49,678
You'll be drinking your own urine
in less than 20 hours.

735
01:00:49,839 --> 01:00:52,399
-Where's Putman?
-He's not here?

736
01:00:52,559 --> 01:00:54,675
He left. He ran off into the jungle.

737
01:00:54,879 --> 01:00:57,677
Oh, by ''ran off,'' do you
mean ''got killed by you''?

738
01:00:57,839 --> 01:01:00,876
Did you really think we wouldn't
notice Putman was gone?

739
01:01:01,039 --> 01:01:03,394
-That's ridiculous.
-Why is that ridiculous?

740
01:01:03,559 --> 01:01:08,075
Look, Putman freaked out in the middle
of the night and took off into the jungle.

741
01:01:08,279 --> 01:01:09,678
We went into your room.

742
01:01:09,839 --> 01:01:12,956
Mark David Chapman over here
has a shrine to Pete.

743
01:01:13,119 --> 01:01:15,235
-lt's unbelievable.
-So l'm a fan.

744
01:01:15,439 --> 01:01:19,955
A fan? Man, you're a fucking loon.
Look, nobody here was killed last night. . .

745
01:01:20,119 --> 01:01:23,156
. . .because Lars was
in the jungle killing Putman.

746
01:01:23,359 --> 01:01:26,112
Hey, look, l could never hurt
another person, okay?

747
01:01:26,279 --> 01:01:29,874
l don't believe in violence. l touch
people to make them feel better.

748
01:01:30,279 --> 01:01:32,918
l have an obligation
to get to the bottom of--

749
01:01:33,079 --> 01:01:36,549
-You are the fucking fun police.
-Juan, what the hell--?

750
01:01:36,759 --> 01:01:38,989
Come on, take it easy!
Quit your bickering!

751
01:01:39,159 --> 01:01:42,435
We get through one more night,
the boat will be here tomorrow.

752
01:01:42,639 --> 01:01:46,917
We'll be all right. So come on,
let's just have a drink and mellow out.

753
01:01:47,079 --> 01:01:50,594
l don't wanna mellow out, Pete.
l wanna know what Lars' deal is.

754
01:01:50,759 --> 01:01:53,717
-You come here--
-l don't have to tell you shit, fun pig!

755
01:01:53,879 --> 01:01:56,677
You wanna fun arrest me?
Get a fun fucking warrant.

756
01:01:56,839 --> 01:02:00,991
Until then, stay out
of my fun fucking face!

757
01:02:01,799 --> 01:02:03,517
Come on.

758
01:02:06,559 --> 01:02:09,835
Jenny, you know
l'm not the killer, right?

759
01:02:09,999 --> 01:02:13,878
Look, Lars, it's not so bad in here, okay?
l'll bring you some magazines.

760
01:02:14,079 --> 01:02:17,116
Yeah? You familiar with
the expression ''sitting duck''?

761
01:02:17,319 --> 01:02:19,230
No.

762
01:02:19,959 --> 01:02:21,870
You guys, this is totally fucked up.

763
01:02:22,039 --> 01:02:25,952
Look, Jenny, if he's the killer,
then we have him in this room.

764
01:02:26,119 --> 01:02:28,713
And if not, then at least
we know it's not him.

765
01:02:36,639 --> 01:02:40,234
Did it stink? You bet it stunk.

766
01:02:40,879 --> 01:02:43,154
Oh, shit.

767
01:02:43,319 --> 01:02:46,152
Hey, you guys gonna be
hanging around for a while?

768
01:02:46,319 --> 01:02:51,837
Totally. We're just getting started.
Anyway, that's my mom for you.

769
01:02:53,319 --> 01:02:55,958
Any of you guys have a mother?

770
01:02:56,159 --> 01:02:58,229
Free drinks, whoever catches me.

771
01:03:13,399 --> 01:03:14,878
Shit.

772
01:03:18,439 --> 01:03:20,430
Oh, God!

773
01:03:27,719 --> 01:03:30,472
-Your prayers have been answered.
-You asshole!

774
01:03:30,679 --> 01:03:34,388
No, l'm not an asshole.
l'm just young, dumb and full--

775
01:03:34,559 --> 01:03:36,038
-What the fuck?
-What?

776
01:03:36,199 --> 01:03:39,350
Something just brushed
against my leg. What the--?

777
01:03:40,479 --> 01:03:43,312
-There's seriously something down here.
-What?!

778
01:03:43,639 --> 01:03:47,678
Oh, no, wait.
lt's just my gigantic cock.

779
01:03:48,199 --> 01:03:50,838
-Amy's got some fantastic advice....
-Oh, my God.

780
01:03:51,679 --> 01:03:55,433
-So you wanna get it on?
-Dirk, get out of the pool.

781
01:03:56,399 --> 01:03:59,038
l'm not kidding. Hurry!

782
01:03:59,519 --> 01:04:02,955
-Hey, that's what l call service.
-No!

783
01:04:03,159 --> 01:04:04,831
Get out of the pool!

784
01:04:17,799 --> 01:04:20,438
Somebody help me!

785
01:04:24,279 --> 01:04:25,951
Putman, you're alive.

786
01:04:26,479 --> 01:04:27,912
You put your arms around me.

787
01:04:28,079 --> 01:04:31,116
l assume this means every other
man on the island is dead.

788
01:04:31,599 --> 01:04:35,433
We gotta get out of here. Dirk's dead.
He got electrocuted in the pool.

789
01:04:35,599 --> 01:04:40,673
Really? What was the look on his face?
He must have screamed bloody murder.

790
01:04:40,839 --> 01:04:42,113
You're scaring me.

791
01:04:42,279 --> 01:04:46,909
l just want to know if smoke
came out of his ears. ls that so wrong?

792
01:04:47,999 --> 01:04:51,594
-Putman, where have you been?
-Running in circles through the jungle.

793
01:04:51,759 --> 01:04:55,274
Thank God you're not dead.
We need to get that auxiliary generator.

794
01:04:55,439 --> 01:05:00,069
Wait, hang on. lf Dirk just got killed,
then Lars couldn't be the killer.

795
01:05:03,639 --> 01:05:08,588
-Be on guard, he might be a little cranky.
-Lars? Lars, we're here.

796
01:05:08,759 --> 01:05:11,068
Oh, do give it a rest, Jen.

797
01:05:16,999 --> 01:05:21,277
-He couldn't have.
-He's far too large.

798
01:05:23,159 --> 01:05:25,514
We gotta find Pete.

799
01:05:26,999 --> 01:05:28,273
Pete.

800
01:05:32,639 --> 01:05:34,152
Pete?

801
01:05:39,319 --> 01:05:41,435
Pete?

802
01:05:41,639 --> 01:05:43,550
You in here, Pete?

803
01:05:43,719 --> 01:05:47,917
Peter, we need the key
to the generator box.

804
01:06:03,639 --> 01:06:07,712
-Damn it!
-lsn't somebody going to get the door?

805
01:06:13,719 --> 01:06:15,437
Who's there?

806
01:06:15,599 --> 01:06:17,032
Who's out there?!

807
01:06:24,199 --> 01:06:27,987
Hey, l think there's a problem
with the lights.

808
01:06:29,159 --> 01:06:30,990
Right?

809
01:06:32,959 --> 01:06:36,918
-Lars will come after us here.
-We don't know for sure that it is Lars.

810
01:06:37,079 --> 01:06:39,718
We don't know if he got out
or if someone else got in.

811
01:06:39,879 --> 01:06:43,667
What is it with you and Lars?
l wonder if you aren't in cahoots.

812
01:06:43,839 --> 01:06:46,353
Let's see, you had sex
with Rolo and he's dead.

813
01:06:46,519 --> 01:06:49,636
-You and Cliff, right? He's dead.
-Give me a break.

814
01:06:49,799 --> 01:06:52,267
l screwed Juan and Pete
and they aren't dead.

815
01:06:52,479 --> 01:06:56,358
-Bloody hell, Jen. Am l the only one?
-Let's get back to the case.

816
01:06:56,519 --> 01:07:00,148
-We have to figure out--
-Why don't you drop the cop routine.

817
01:07:00,479 --> 01:07:03,994
As soon as you drop the
''l've got nothing to hide'' routine, Juan.

818
01:07:04,799 --> 01:07:08,917
You were looking for this letter
from the Encarnacion prison facility?

819
01:07:09,119 --> 01:07:12,907
-What the fuck, man?
-Fuck. Why you are doing this, man?

820
01:07:13,119 --> 01:07:16,475
''Juan shows no signs of the bizarre
and horrible behavior. . .

821
01:07:16,639 --> 01:07:21,588
. . .that brought him to this institution.
We believe him to be fully rehabilitated. . .

822
01:07:21,759 --> 01:07:24,717
. . .and will be an excellent
addition to your staff. ''

823
01:07:25,679 --> 01:07:28,557
-What did you do, Juan?
-l did nothing, Jenny.

824
01:07:28,719 --> 01:07:30,437
What the fuck did you do, man?

825
01:07:30,639 --> 01:07:33,915
Costa Rican prison, that's some
hardcore anal action, man.

826
01:07:34,079 --> 01:07:37,230
-Juan, we have to know.
-What did you do, Juan?

827
01:07:37,439 --> 01:07:40,158
-What did you do, Juan?
-What the fuck did you do?

828
01:07:40,359 --> 01:07:41,838
-What did you do?
-Tell us!

829
01:07:42,039 --> 01:07:43,836
l did nothing!

830
01:07:48,359 --> 01:07:49,678
-lt's Chupacabra!
-Pete.

831
01:07:49,879 --> 01:07:51,676
No!

832
01:07:55,879 --> 01:07:57,949
God.

833
01:08:01,199 --> 01:08:05,875
-How could you do that?
-Wait, wait. l did not do this.

834
01:08:06,079 --> 01:08:09,992
-l am not a killer.
-What the fuck, man? Then what is this?

835
01:08:10,159 --> 01:08:12,753
You want to know what l did?

836
01:08:12,919 --> 01:08:15,433
You all want to know what l did?

837
01:08:16,719 --> 01:08:20,348
Juan Castillo went to jail. . .

838
01:08:20,519 --> 01:08:25,832
. . .for having sex with a goat.
All right?

839
01:08:27,039 --> 01:08:31,271
What do you want me to say?
We lived on a farm.

840
01:08:31,439 --> 01:08:33,828
And l got lonely!

841
01:08:35,399 --> 01:08:37,071
We were--

842
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:41,434
We were just a couple of stupid kids.

843
01:08:41,599 --> 01:08:44,557
No, it wasn't Juan.

844
01:08:44,719 --> 01:08:48,109
lt was Dave, wasn't it?

845
01:08:48,319 --> 01:08:51,072
You hated him for what
he did to your parents.

846
01:08:51,239 --> 01:08:55,198
You see, what none of us did know. . .

847
01:08:55,359 --> 01:08:58,874
. . .indeed, what none
of us could know. . .

848
01:08:59,039 --> 01:09:04,113
. . .was David's parents were trampled
to death at a Coconut Pete concert.

849
01:09:05,759 --> 01:09:07,556
What the hell is wrong with you?

850
01:09:07,719 --> 01:09:10,631
Everyone knows Dave's parents
got killed at a Pete show.

851
01:09:11,199 --> 01:09:14,874
-Way to bring up a sore subject.
-What? l-- What?

852
01:09:15,439 --> 01:09:18,112
You think l could have killed him?

853
01:09:18,279 --> 01:09:21,157
He's my Uncle Petey.

854
01:09:21,319 --> 01:09:23,435
You all saw him as. . .

855
01:09:23,599 --> 01:09:28,673
. . .a mellow island songster
and a resort owner. . .

856
01:09:28,839 --> 01:09:32,309
. . .but how many of you knew
that he was afraid of dogs. . .

857
01:09:32,479 --> 01:09:34,834
. . .and that his favorite
spice was rosemary?

858
01:09:35,799 --> 01:09:41,237
How many of you knew that he was
uncircumcised and smelled of oranges?

859
01:09:41,439 --> 01:09:44,112
Yes, that's all well and good, David.

860
01:09:44,439 --> 01:09:48,990
But l'll bet hind to horses
that you inherit the island.

861
01:09:50,679 --> 01:09:53,751
-The island is already mine.
-What?

862
01:09:55,039 --> 01:09:56,757
Pete signed it over last week.

863
01:09:56,959 --> 01:09:59,189
He was going on the road,
where he belonged.

864
01:09:59,359 --> 01:10:02,988
He was forming a super group.
Billy Squier and Eddie Money.

865
01:10:03,199 --> 01:10:07,636
Don Henley was gonna play drums!
Fuck, that would've been tight! Fuck.

866
01:10:07,839 --> 01:10:12,071
He was gonna sell the island
to the Navy for test bombing.

867
01:10:12,239 --> 01:10:14,833
But l told him l could
handle the responsibility.

868
01:10:17,159 --> 01:10:20,196
-Lars.
-No.

869
01:10:20,359 --> 01:10:21,951
No.

870
01:10:22,119 --> 01:10:24,314
Pete.

871
01:10:24,479 --> 01:10:27,551
Oh, my God. Pete.

872
01:10:31,599 --> 01:10:34,636
Bravo, Lars, bravo.

873
01:10:34,799 --> 01:10:37,836
Very convincing.
Very convincing.

874
01:10:38,639 --> 01:10:41,915
-You fucker!
-Lars, stop it!

875
01:10:44,239 --> 01:10:46,116
-You ain't nothing!
-Stop it!

876
01:10:46,279 --> 01:10:48,076
-Hold it.
-Let's lock him up again.

877
01:10:48,279 --> 01:10:50,839
-Bring it! You're dead!
-No! Stop it!

878
01:10:50,999 --> 01:10:53,308
-lt's madness!
-We're not locking anybody up.

879
01:10:53,519 --> 01:10:56,477
We're all gonna stay
together in one room.

880
01:10:56,639 --> 01:10:58,357
The boat will be here tomorrow.

881
01:10:58,519 --> 01:11:01,875
We'll go gather the guests
and wait until the morning.

882
01:11:02,039 --> 01:11:03,552
We're gonna do this together.

883
01:11:03,719 --> 01:11:07,268
And we're gonna
make it through the night, okay?

884
01:11:21,559 --> 01:11:24,027
Screw this. l'm not going
anywhere with Lars.

885
01:11:24,199 --> 01:11:27,874
l'm not going anywhere with Juan.
What kind of man has sex with a goat?

886
01:11:28,039 --> 01:11:30,507
Hey, l used a condom.

887
01:11:31,279 --> 01:11:34,191
You told me they were
against your religion.

888
01:11:36,599 --> 01:11:40,956
You know, l need to find Penelope.
l am sure you all understand.

889
01:11:42,519 --> 01:11:46,114
You come anywhere near my cabana,
l'm taking your head off.

890
01:11:46,279 --> 01:11:47,792
Let's get out of here, Dave.

891
01:11:48,359 --> 01:11:51,749
-Come on, Dave, let's get out of here.
-l don't think so.

892
01:11:56,119 --> 01:12:00,192
Jenny, you're making
a most grievous mistake.

893
01:12:03,079 --> 01:12:08,278
l'm still not sure what happened with
that dodgy business back in the jungle. . .

894
01:12:08,439 --> 01:12:11,875
. . .but l'm plagued by the dreams.

895
01:12:12,039 --> 01:12:14,837
l believe l'm safer on my own.

896
01:12:16,719 --> 01:12:22,032
-Well, that plan went to hell.
-Well, at least they left us a torch.

897
01:12:22,199 --> 01:12:24,190
Jenny? Jenny?

898
01:12:26,759 --> 01:12:30,638
l believe l know
where the generator is.

899
01:12:31,639 --> 01:12:33,869
That's the stuff.

900
01:12:35,519 --> 01:12:37,316
Yes.

901
01:12:47,159 --> 01:12:49,514
Damn it. He must have
taken my swords.

902
01:12:49,679 --> 01:12:52,477
l don't care if l have to carve
a spear out of bamboo.

903
01:12:52,879 --> 01:12:57,236
-Listen.
-No, l'm so sick of running from this--

904
01:12:57,959 --> 01:12:59,551
l thought we didn't have power.

905
01:13:00,799 --> 01:13:03,267
-Dave?
-Naughty Cal, Bongo and Tokey

906
01:13:03,439 --> 01:13:07,193
Dave? Dave?

907
01:13:07,399 --> 01:13:10,755
So the three amigos
Took an undersea trip

908
01:13:10,919 --> 01:13:13,638
Never were seen again

909
01:13:13,799 --> 01:13:15,755
God.

910
01:13:24,039 --> 01:13:26,599
-lt's me, it's me, it's me.
-We're all gonna die

911
01:13:26,759 --> 01:13:30,798
-We're all gonna die
-Holy shit.

912
01:13:38,839 --> 01:13:40,830
Oh, my God. The lock's broken.

913
01:13:42,239 --> 01:13:43,592
My God. He's out there.

914
01:13:44,079 --> 01:13:46,547
Quick, under the bed. Hurry, come on.

915
01:13:46,719 --> 01:13:48,550
Go, go. Hurry.

916
01:13:49,119 --> 01:13:51,428
-You'll never fit.
-Go, go, go, go, go.

917
01:13:55,039 --> 01:13:58,031
Come on. Hurry.

918
01:13:58,239 --> 01:14:01,754
What are you doing?
Lars, what are you doing? Hurry.

919
01:14:01,919 --> 01:14:04,592
Lars, please come on!

920
01:14:05,199 --> 01:14:08,555
Lars, come on. He's coming.

921
01:14:17,679 --> 01:14:20,751
Holy shit. ls that how you
escaped out of that window?

922
01:14:20,919 --> 01:14:23,228
Why don't you just do that
all the time?

923
01:14:23,399 --> 01:14:25,708
ls that a fat joke?

924
01:14:26,479 --> 01:14:28,470
What the--?

925
01:14:30,159 --> 01:14:32,354
What the hell, Jenny?

926
01:15:16,079 --> 01:15:18,832
Putman, it was you?

927
01:15:19,039 --> 01:15:21,428
-What? What was me?
-Step back, Putman.

928
01:15:21,599 --> 01:15:25,353
Oh, you actually believe that
l'm the killer. Oh, that's a laugh.

929
01:15:25,559 --> 01:15:27,515
Then what are you doing here?

930
01:15:27,719 --> 01:15:29,471
Well, l just popped by to say--

931
01:15:31,879 --> 01:15:33,198
You perv.

932
01:15:33,399 --> 01:15:36,835
Really, there's a perfectly
reasonable explanation for all this.

933
01:15:37,039 --> 01:15:39,951
You see, it seemed like
such a good final memento and--

934
01:15:40,119 --> 01:15:43,031
You know how good l think
you look in red, in that--

935
01:15:43,199 --> 01:15:45,952
-No!
-Oh, dear God.

936
01:15:46,159 --> 01:15:47,877
Oh, good God.

937
01:15:48,079 --> 01:15:50,115
-Where's the key?
-l don't know.

938
01:15:50,319 --> 01:15:53,356
Lock the door!
Lock the door!

939
01:15:53,519 --> 01:15:55,589
-The lock's broken.
-Broken?

940
01:15:56,119 --> 01:15:58,997
You've manacled me to my deathbed,
you Piccadilly whore.

941
01:16:00,519 --> 01:16:02,350
l'm so sorry.

942
01:16:02,519 --> 01:16:04,589
l could never stay mad at you, Jenny.

943
01:16:04,759 --> 01:16:08,388
Quickly, give me the racket,
give me the balls.

944
01:16:08,599 --> 01:16:11,750
-Go, go.
-Quickly! Run!

945
01:16:13,439 --> 01:16:14,872
Get him.

946
01:16:18,999 --> 01:16:21,957
Machete Phil. l knew it.

947
01:16:24,399 --> 01:16:26,515
Oh, God!

948
01:16:29,359 --> 01:16:30,678
Oh, God.

949
01:16:31,359 --> 01:16:33,156
-Go.
-No.

950
01:16:33,319 --> 01:16:36,197
-Go, dear Jen. Go.
-No.

951
01:16:40,479 --> 01:16:41,992
Fuck off.

952
01:16:42,839 --> 01:16:44,716
Come on.

953
01:16:44,879 --> 01:16:47,313
l'm sorry.

954
01:16:54,839 --> 01:16:59,594
You! l should've known it was you.
lt didn't surprise me a bit, really.

955
01:16:59,759 --> 01:17:01,989
Goddamn it, Putman. Who is it?

956
01:17:02,159 --> 01:17:05,231
l'm sure you think
l'll go down without a fight. . .

957
01:17:05,439 --> 01:17:09,148
. . .but it's not yet game, set--

958
01:17:42,759 --> 01:17:46,115
-Is he gone?
-What?

959
01:17:46,279 --> 01:17:48,156
Is he gone?

960
01:17:57,359 --> 01:18:00,669
Yeah, I think he's gone.

961
01:18:13,519 --> 01:18:16,636
Soap, please.

962
01:18:28,839 --> 01:18:33,708
Hey, nice helmet, Lars. About time you
two perverts showed up at the party.

963
01:18:33,879 --> 01:18:35,437
Pour it. Pour it.

964
01:18:39,719 --> 01:18:42,995
Jesus Christ, that's blood.

965
01:18:52,399 --> 01:18:54,390
What the fuck?

966
01:18:54,559 --> 01:18:55,958
Oh, God.

967
01:18:58,439 --> 01:19:00,555
Oh, God.

968
01:19:02,679 --> 01:19:05,113
We're all gonna die!

969
01:19:20,519 --> 01:19:23,511
Penelope, where's Juan?

970
01:19:23,679 --> 01:19:26,876
l don't know.
l haven't seen him all night.

971
01:19:27,839 --> 01:19:30,558
What the hell is going on?

972
01:19:31,359 --> 01:19:34,635
-Juan. Juan.
-Hold on.

973
01:19:34,839 --> 01:19:38,149
-What are you doing? Let me go!
-Don't move.

974
01:19:38,319 --> 01:19:40,594
Where the hell have you been?

975
01:19:40,759 --> 01:19:45,071
l was looking for Penelope.
Why you are looking at me like that?

976
01:19:45,239 --> 01:19:48,197
You disappeared and now
you show up covered in blood.

977
01:19:48,359 --> 01:19:51,157
Because l just found Putman.
He's dead.

978
01:19:52,039 --> 01:19:53,552
Oh, shit! Sam!

979
01:19:54,999 --> 01:19:57,194
-Oh, my God.
-The mud bath.

980
01:19:57,639 --> 01:19:58,913
Let's go, Peney.

981
01:20:16,239 --> 01:20:18,309
Oh, God.

982
01:20:54,239 --> 01:20:57,549
-Oh, no.
-What?

983
01:21:00,439 --> 01:21:03,909
Sam. Sam.

984
01:21:04,599 --> 01:21:06,669
Sam!

985
01:21:07,039 --> 01:21:09,155
Oh, fuck.

986
01:21:27,079 --> 01:21:29,309
-Get out.
-What?

987
01:21:29,639 --> 01:21:30,958
Get out now.

988
01:21:37,719 --> 01:21:41,917
Did you know that l can hold my breath
for three minutes and 33 seconds?

989
01:21:42,759 --> 01:21:46,877
-Nobody ever suspects the fun police.
-Bullshit. l always have suspected you.

990
01:21:47,079 --> 01:21:49,513
-Bullshit. You did not.
-You are the bullshit!

991
01:21:49,679 --> 01:21:52,432
He's the guy from the
campfire story. Machete Phil.

992
01:21:52,759 --> 01:21:57,037
-The kid with no dick.
-No, that's just an old campfire story.

993
01:21:57,439 --> 01:22:01,432
-What do you piss out of? Your asshole?
-That's just a story!

994
01:22:01,599 --> 01:22:03,635
l have a dick.

995
01:22:03,799 --> 01:22:05,437
l'm not Machete Phil.

996
01:22:05,799 --> 01:22:08,154
l'm Machete Sam.

997
01:22:08,319 --> 01:22:13,871
-Sam, why are you doing this?
-Oh, l remember it like it was yesterday.

998
01:22:14,679 --> 01:22:18,274
l asked Rolo if he had any grass
and he said he didn't have any.

999
01:22:18,439 --> 01:22:20,634
So then l followed him into the jungle.

1000
01:22:20,839 --> 01:22:22,795
Would you believe what l saw?

1001
01:22:22,959 --> 01:22:25,234
He had grass. My grass!

1002
01:22:25,959 --> 01:22:28,427
A huge bag of it.

1003
01:22:28,599 --> 01:22:32,035
And he was smoking it
with those two little hussies...

1004
01:22:32,239 --> 01:22:35,197
. . .even though he said he had none.

1005
01:22:36,799 --> 01:22:40,508
So then-- No, wait, that's not it.

1006
01:22:41,039 --> 01:22:43,633
l found out Pete
was giving the island to Dave.

1007
01:22:43,799 --> 01:22:46,472
Oh, yeah, that's it.
lt wasn't about the grass.

1008
01:22:46,639 --> 01:22:50,075
Although that was incredibly uncool.

1009
01:22:50,359 --> 01:22:53,351
It was about Pete giving
the island to that shithead!

1010
01:22:53,519 --> 01:22:56,829
All-night-raving, pill-popping
little son of a bitch!

1011
01:22:57,039 --> 01:23:00,315
What about me? l deserved it.

1012
01:23:00,479 --> 01:23:03,232
l'm the best damn employee
this place has ever seen.

1013
01:23:03,399 --> 01:23:07,153
Dave was gonna run it into the ground.
Not on my watch!

1014
01:23:07,319 --> 01:23:12,518
This is my home. Pete thinks l'm just
a clown. Good for fun and games.

1015
01:23:12,679 --> 01:23:15,239
Well, l got you guys
to do your jobs, didn't l?

1016
01:23:15,399 --> 01:23:17,469
Good managerial skills,
don't you think?

1017
01:23:17,959 --> 01:23:22,749
Setting you guys up to decipher
that stupid ''Naughty Cal'' song.

1018
01:23:23,919 --> 01:23:27,832
Who's the orca? Who's the octopus?
l am the walrus.

1019
01:23:28,039 --> 01:23:30,872
l am the walrus.
l am the walrus!

1020
01:23:33,199 --> 01:23:35,713
Get out of here now.
l can't hold him for long.

1021
01:23:35,879 --> 01:23:38,712
Try putting him to sleep.
Try the Snoring Panda.

1022
01:23:38,919 --> 01:23:41,433
l can't reach it. l can handle this.

1023
01:23:41,599 --> 01:23:43,829
He'll orgasm for another
few minutes. Go.

1024
01:23:44,039 --> 01:23:47,475
-l'm not leaving you.
-l'll be okay. Get out of here.

1025
01:23:47,639 --> 01:23:49,038
lt's gonna get messy.

1026
01:23:49,239 --> 01:23:51,434
Go.

1027
01:23:58,279 --> 01:24:00,349
-Back to the club!
-Are you crazy?

1028
01:24:00,639 --> 01:24:04,712
lt's the most secure building on the
island. lt's where we keep the booze.

1029
01:24:10,159 --> 01:24:12,354
There you are.

1030
01:24:13,439 --> 01:24:15,907
-Penelope!
-Juan!

1031
01:24:16,319 --> 01:24:18,549
Look out!

1032
01:24:19,079 --> 01:24:22,071
Look, he's after us.
She's safer with them. Let's go!

1033
01:24:23,479 --> 01:24:25,231
Let's go!

1034
01:24:25,399 --> 01:24:27,390
Get the gate!

1035
01:24:42,039 --> 01:24:43,631
Oh, God! No!

1036
01:24:45,839 --> 01:24:47,670
-Oh, God!
-Penelope!

1037
01:24:47,879 --> 01:24:50,029
-No!
-Penelope! Penelope!

1038
01:24:50,239 --> 01:24:54,027
Stop! God, stop it!

1039
01:24:54,239 --> 01:24:56,275
What are you doing?

1040
01:24:56,479 --> 01:24:58,151
You'll never make it!

1041
01:24:59,319 --> 01:25:01,628
Stop. Please.

1042
01:25:02,519 --> 01:25:04,077
Watch out!

1043
01:25:04,799 --> 01:25:06,357
Harder!

1044
01:25:06,559 --> 01:25:08,550
Hurry! She can't breathe!

1045
01:25:15,879 --> 01:25:18,393
Penelope, get up.

1046
01:25:23,559 --> 01:25:26,949
Juan. Juan, get up.

1047
01:25:27,159 --> 01:25:30,390
Juan, get up. Come on, hurry.

1048
01:25:30,599 --> 01:25:32,237
Come on!

1049
01:25:35,679 --> 01:25:37,317
Oh, God.

1050
01:25:37,519 --> 01:25:41,228
lt's not a party until someone
breaks the Jacuzzi.

1051
01:25:41,439 --> 01:25:43,395
Oh, God! Juan!

1052
01:25:55,919 --> 01:25:57,193
Lars!

1053
01:25:57,959 --> 01:26:00,553
The fun is done.

1054
01:26:04,759 --> 01:26:06,351
What happened to the hot tub?

1055
01:26:29,239 --> 01:26:30,752
Oh, God!

1056
01:26:31,279 --> 01:26:32,871
No!

1057
01:26:33,039 --> 01:26:34,518
No, it's not possible.

1058
01:26:34,679 --> 01:26:37,068
-What do we do?
-We can lose him in the jungle.

1059
01:26:37,239 --> 01:26:39,355
-The jungle?
-l can get us through.

1060
01:26:44,439 --> 01:26:46,191
Come on.

1061
01:26:46,359 --> 01:26:48,315
-Hurry!
-Go, go, go!

1062
01:26:48,639 --> 01:26:49,992
l know where this goes.

1063
01:26:50,199 --> 01:26:51,757
Let's go. Come on, quickly.

1064
01:26:53,759 --> 01:26:55,590
Go.

1065
01:26:57,799 --> 01:27:02,270
-Oh, God. This was your big plan?
-We can do it. lt's high tide.

1066
01:27:02,479 --> 01:27:03,753
All right, now, listen.

1067
01:27:03,919 --> 01:27:06,308
l know this is going

1068
01:27:06,479 --> 01:27:10,392

together and clench your ass-cheeks. . .

1069
01:27:10,559 --> 01:27:14,518
. . .or else water will fly up your butthole
and pulverize your intestine.

1070
01:27:14,719 --> 01:27:16,437
Gross.

He didn't take it. He sunk it.

1080
01:28:07,039 --> 01:28:09,633
Juan, any way you could get
the propeller off?

1081
01:28:09,799 --> 01:28:11,949
We could put it on
