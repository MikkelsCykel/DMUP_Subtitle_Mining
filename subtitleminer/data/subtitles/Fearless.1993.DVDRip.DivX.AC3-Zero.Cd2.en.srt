1
00:00:01,331 --> 00:00:03,026
That was right behind me.

2
00:00:05,035 --> 00:00:06,593
Did he have red hair?

3
00:00:07,003 --> 00:00:09,096
Yes. Kind of reddish brown.

4
00:00:09,973 --> 00:00:11,531
- Tall man?
- Six feet.

5
00:00:11,708 --> 00:00:13,198
And a moustache?

6
00:00:13,676 --> 00:00:14,506
Yes.

7
00:00:15,445 --> 00:00:16,707
You mean me.

8
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:19,412
Remember? We talked at the hospital.

9
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:23,150
We were on the other side of the plane.

10
00:00:24,587 --> 00:00:25,679
Sorry.

11
00:00:26,122 --> 00:00:28,249
Since it happened, I get confused.

12
00:00:31,394 --> 00:00:33,294
Anyone else remember that row?

13
00:00:34,097 --> 00:00:36,156
21C was three rows ahead of me.

14
00:00:36,599 --> 00:00:38,396
They were smashed flat.

15
00:00:38,501 --> 00:00:39,934
Can anyone else help?

16
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:41,765
Go ahead, say something.

17
00:00:43,573 --> 00:00:46,064
- Anyone else have information?
- Stop it.

18
00:00:47,677 --> 00:00:49,167
Just let her go.

19
00:00:49,813 --> 00:00:50,837
Why?

20
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:55,347
This isn't doing anybody any good.

21
00:00:55,418 --> 00:00:57,215
She only wants to know what happened.

22
00:00:57,287 --> 00:00:58,720
My son died.

23
00:00:58,822 --> 00:01:00,949
Yes, but you know how he died.

24
00:01:01,624 --> 00:01:03,057
You were with him.

25
00:01:06,596 --> 00:01:08,757
When was the last time you saw your son?

26
00:01:08,865 --> 00:01:11,095
His birthday, about a month before.

27
00:01:12,035 --> 00:01:14,333
I don't remember kissing him good-bye.

28
00:01:14,504 --> 00:01:16,995
I know I did, but I just can't remember.

29
00:01:19,275 --> 00:01:20,469
You're very young.

30
00:01:22,912 --> 00:01:24,038
I'm not young.

31
00:01:25,148 --> 00:01:26,740
How old was your boy?

32
00:01:28,952 --> 00:01:30,476
He was almost two.

33
00:01:31,254 --> 00:01:32,380
I'm sorry.

34
00:01:32,489 --> 00:01:34,116
He wasn't with you very long.

35
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:35,316
Jesus Christ!

36
00:01:35,391 --> 00:01:38,258
This is sadistic.
And we're not accomplishing anything!

37
00:01:47,904 --> 00:01:49,166
Do you remember me?

38
00:01:49,772 --> 00:01:51,763
I'm Lisa. The flight attendant.

39
00:01:58,581 --> 00:02:00,378
I really wanted to see you.

40
00:02:02,285 --> 00:02:04,719
I came here mostly to see you.

41
00:02:07,957 --> 00:02:10,585
I think about you and your baby a lot.

42
00:02:13,963 --> 00:02:16,955
Do you remember how I tried to help you
with the seat belt?

43
00:02:18,101 --> 00:02:19,193
Help me?

44
00:02:20,503 --> 00:02:24,030
You told me everything would be okay.
You think you helped me?

45
00:02:24,807 --> 00:02:26,502
Well, I tried.

46
00:02:26,609 --> 00:02:27,769
Tried!

47
00:02:28,144 --> 00:02:30,806
You told me to hold him. I couldn't.

48
00:02:31,314 --> 00:02:33,373
You told me everything would be okay.

49
00:02:33,449 --> 00:02:34,108
It wasn't!

50
00:02:34,184 --> 00:02:35,310
Please, don't say that.

51
00:02:35,385 --> 00:02:36,374
I didn't...

52
00:02:37,353 --> 00:02:38,377
I didn't know!

53
00:02:38,454 --> 00:02:39,887
You didn't know what?

54
00:02:40,323 --> 00:02:41,153
Please.

55
00:02:41,224 --> 00:02:42,623
You told me to hold him.

56
00:02:42,692 --> 00:02:44,922
- You knew I couldn't!
- It's not my fault!

57
00:02:44,994 --> 00:02:46,825
We're not here to blame each other.

58
00:02:46,896 --> 00:02:48,955
You said everything would be okay...

59
00:02:49,032 --> 00:02:50,260
...and it wasn't!

60
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,492
He died!

61
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,203
You want everybody to talk.

62
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:02,171
But only if it's nice things.

63
00:03:02,245 --> 00:03:03,712
No, that's not true.

64
00:03:05,615 --> 00:03:06,741
My son died!

65
00:03:06,916 --> 00:03:09,441
And blaming her won't bring
your baby back.

66
00:03:23,299 --> 00:03:25,324
Of course they think it's fair.

67
00:03:25,868 --> 00:03:27,836
So what? What do you think?

68
00:03:29,872 --> 00:03:31,237
I'm being fucked.

69
00:03:31,441 --> 00:03:34,774
The big law firms are getting
much more for their clients.

70
00:03:35,712 --> 00:03:37,373
I'll get another lawyer.

71
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:41,680
Mr. Brillstein, I heard a woman got
$2 million for her dead baby.

72
00:03:41,751 --> 00:03:43,946
I think I should get at least that.

73
00:03:45,855 --> 00:03:48,187
I'll call you. I'll call you every day.

74
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:50,149
Good-bye.

75
00:03:55,798 --> 00:03:57,288
You have to understand...

76
00:03:57,567 --> 00:04:00,195
...they owe us. They kill them
and they have to pay.

77
00:04:00,336 --> 00:04:02,668
You don't understand a fucking thing!

78
00:04:03,973 --> 00:04:05,440
I understand, Manny.

79
00:04:06,109 --> 00:04:07,906
I understand that I'm alone.

80
00:04:13,316 --> 00:04:15,750
So, pain and suffering are compensabLe.

81
00:04:16,286 --> 00:04:19,722
Apart from the other compensable losses
such as...

82
00:04:19,789 --> 00:04:22,849
...the $2-million Nutty Nick stores contract.

83
00:04:22,992 --> 00:04:24,482
We didn't have a contract.

84
00:04:25,228 --> 00:04:27,196
- Whose side are you on?
- Relax.

85
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:30,460
Don't tell me to relax. You have a husband
and a partnership insurance.

86
00:04:30,533 --> 00:04:31,465
I have...

87
00:04:32,001 --> 00:04:33,764
...a deposition from...

88
00:04:33,836 --> 00:04:35,394
...Mr. Nutty Nick...

89
00:04:36,539 --> 00:04:39,235
...that he had every intention...

90
00:04:39,742 --> 00:04:42,370
...of hiring Mr. Gordon and Mr. Klein.

91
00:04:42,445 --> 00:04:43,571
That's good enough.

92
00:04:43,646 --> 00:04:45,011
He's lying.

93
00:04:45,181 --> 00:04:46,614
It's nice, but he's lying.

94
00:04:46,683 --> 00:04:47,775
All right.

95
00:04:48,484 --> 00:04:49,712
Do me a favor.

96
00:04:50,353 --> 00:04:51,615
Don't say that.

97
00:04:52,221 --> 00:04:54,712
They don't have to know your opinion,
okay?

98
00:04:56,326 --> 00:04:58,351
Work with me on this, Mr. Klein.

99
00:04:58,761 --> 00:04:59,887
I'm sorry.

100
00:04:59,996 --> 00:05:03,022
You promised to do your best
for Mrs. Gordon and her children.

101
00:05:03,132 --> 00:05:04,963
You get a third of what we get?

102
00:05:05,068 --> 00:05:06,467
I know. I'm terrible.

103
00:05:07,603 --> 00:05:09,696
One-third is standard, Mr. Klein.

104
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:13,837
It's in my interest to get
as large a settlement as possible.

105
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:15,605
In fact, that's my job.

106
00:05:15,878 --> 00:05:17,368
I don't apologize for it.

107
00:05:17,447 --> 00:05:20,883
No, this is America in the '90s.
Nobody apologizes anymore.

108
00:05:21,117 --> 00:05:22,516
They write a memoir.

109
00:05:23,753 --> 00:05:26,722
This is the law. Not some trick I invented.

110
00:05:27,056 --> 00:05:31,152
Each minute that you and Mr. Gordon
knew that you were going to die...

111
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:33,490
...is compensable as pain and suffering.

112
00:05:33,596 --> 00:05:34,585
Testify...

113
00:05:35,031 --> 00:05:36,498
...to the mental anguish...

114
00:05:36,566 --> 00:05:38,693
...that you and Mr. Gordon experienced...

115
00:05:38,768 --> 00:05:41,168
...and each minute is worth dollars.

116
00:05:41,604 --> 00:05:45,267
Big dollars. Dollars to which
you and Mrs. Gordon are entitled.

117
00:05:46,509 --> 00:05:48,443
What you really want me to say...

118
00:05:48,678 --> 00:05:52,614
...is that Jeff wept at the prospect
of his wife widowed and kids orphaned.

119
00:05:52,782 --> 00:05:56,548
It's a shame he died instantly.
If only he'd been mashed up and died...

120
00:05:56,619 --> 00:05:58,143
...slowly in my arms, Nan...

121
00:05:58,221 --> 00:05:59,188
Jesus, Max!

122
00:05:59,255 --> 00:06:00,552
...could make out on this.

123
00:06:00,623 --> 00:06:02,090
Fine. Good night.

124
00:06:07,797 --> 00:06:09,355
Are you ashamed of me?

125
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:14,292
I'm trying to get money, so I don't meet
your standards of widowhood?

126
00:06:15,004 --> 00:06:18,030
Let me ask you something.
If Jeff was here, what would he do?

127
00:06:19,142 --> 00:06:20,769
Come on, Max, tell me.

128
00:06:21,811 --> 00:06:22,835
I can't lie.

129
00:06:22,912 --> 00:06:27,246
If you died and he had lived, what would
he say to help Laura and Jonah?

130
00:06:28,551 --> 00:06:31,145
I know he ripped you off for the tickets.

131
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:32,152
Maybe!

132
00:06:32,321 --> 00:06:33,379
Maybe he'd pay him back.

133
00:06:33,456 --> 00:06:35,014
Are you punishing Jeff?

134
00:06:40,263 --> 00:06:41,890
I'll say what you want.

135
00:07:58,508 --> 00:07:59,566
Let it go.

136
00:08:01,511 --> 00:08:02,842
I can Let it go.

137
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:51,187
I can't live as a coward.

138
00:08:52,261 --> 00:08:53,353
Oh, fuck.

139
00:09:55,157 --> 00:09:58,251
So I argued that it wasn't fair to us
and he agreed.

140
00:09:58,394 --> 00:10:00,589
He just said, "Life is unfair."

141
00:10:00,896 --> 00:10:04,730
So now the test's next week
and it's on Europe, not Central America.

142
00:10:04,967 --> 00:10:06,662
I think he proved his own point.

143
00:10:06,736 --> 00:10:08,795
Yeah, that's what I thought.

144
00:10:14,276 --> 00:10:16,141
What'd you do today, Dad?

145
00:10:21,617 --> 00:10:22,709
Go ahead.

146
00:10:25,521 --> 00:10:26,545
Tell him.

147
00:10:27,657 --> 00:10:29,454
What? What'd you do?

148
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:38,292
Talk to me.

149
00:10:40,936 --> 00:10:42,528
Tell me what's going on.

150
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,766
Talk to me!

151
00:10:53,649 --> 00:10:57,415
Each day you have to jump off a roof
or stand before a train to lose your fear?

152
00:10:57,486 --> 00:10:58,578
Is that it?

153
00:10:59,922 --> 00:11:01,116
What about me?

154
00:11:01,457 --> 00:11:02,924
What about Jonah?

155
00:11:03,192 --> 00:11:05,854
- You're like a crazy person.
- I'm not crazy.

156
00:11:08,264 --> 00:11:11,358
I love you. We have lived together
for 16 years!

157
00:11:12,201 --> 00:11:13,634
They've been great.

158
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:15,532
Oh, not always.

159
00:11:16,038 --> 00:11:17,505
Yes. Always.

160
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:20,903
They've always been great for me.

161
00:11:21,077 --> 00:11:23,545
Even when I hate you, I know love you.

162
00:11:29,518 --> 00:11:31,247
I know you were happy too.

163
00:11:32,722 --> 00:11:33,711
Remember?

164
00:11:49,705 --> 00:11:51,639
Do you remember our marriage?

165
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,744
Even if I could remember, then what?

166
00:12:02,752 --> 00:12:04,549
How can I live in a memory?

167
00:12:05,955 --> 00:12:07,354
You see, that's cruel.

168
00:12:07,523 --> 00:12:09,923
- Do you know that's cruel?
- That's the truth.

169
00:12:10,092 --> 00:12:11,150
The truth?

170
00:12:11,494 --> 00:12:13,519
You didn't tell Jonah the truth.

171
00:12:15,097 --> 00:12:17,190
It was unfair to use him that way.

172
00:12:17,466 --> 00:12:18,433
Fair?

173
00:12:18,567 --> 00:12:21,331
Am I supposed to let you kill yourself?

174
00:12:22,304 --> 00:12:24,135
I walked away from that crash alive.

175
00:12:24,206 --> 00:12:27,801
That's what survived.
The taste and touch and beauty of life.

176
00:12:27,877 --> 00:12:28,775
But I love that.

177
00:12:28,844 --> 00:12:31,642
- I won't give that up!
- I don't want you to give it up!

178
00:12:32,548 --> 00:12:33,776
Let me in.

179
00:12:35,017 --> 00:12:36,575
Let me be part of it.

180
00:12:38,888 --> 00:12:39,946
You can't.

181
00:12:42,057 --> 00:12:44,992
- I wish I'd been on that plane.
- I'm grateful you weren't.

182
00:12:45,094 --> 00:12:48,928
You don't make sense. You said
it was extraordinary, so beautiful.

183
00:12:49,064 --> 00:12:52,124
You're right. I don't make sense
and I don't want to.

184
00:12:58,874 --> 00:13:00,933
I know that what you found is...

185
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:05,569
...special, whatever it is,
and wherever it leads you, it's thrilling.

186
00:13:07,716 --> 00:13:09,343
But there must be a way...

187
00:13:10,319 --> 00:13:12,787
...to live with it so it does make sense.

188
00:13:18,093 --> 00:13:19,822
I'm going to survive this.

189
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:26,124
I can't fight for you anymore. You want
to destroy yourself? I can't stop you.

190
00:13:28,737 --> 00:13:30,170
I hope you make it.

191
00:14:13,048 --> 00:14:14,675
You been dreaming a lot?

192
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:17,009
- You bet.
- Me too.

193
00:14:19,755 --> 00:14:21,450
Were you alone on the plane?

194
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:24,150
No, I was with my best friend. My partner.

195
00:14:25,594 --> 00:14:27,027
He was decapitated.

196
00:14:29,899 --> 00:14:31,059
You saw him?

197
00:14:40,075 --> 00:14:41,542
I should be going.

198
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:42,975
Thanks for coming.

199
00:14:49,084 --> 00:14:50,381
You know, if...

200
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,912
If Manny has any interest
in doing carpentry full time...

201
00:14:53,989 --> 00:14:55,957
...I could talk to some people.

202
00:14:56,625 --> 00:14:59,025
They'd be happy to work
with somebody like him.

203
00:14:59,962 --> 00:15:01,759
Don't talk about my husband.

204
00:15:02,731 --> 00:15:03,720
Sorry.

205
00:15:04,767 --> 00:15:07,998
No, it's all right.
I'm angry with him, that's all.

206
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:14,933
Don't look so scared.

207
00:15:15,377 --> 00:15:16,674
I'm not scared.

208
00:15:17,246 --> 00:15:19,009
I'm not scared of anything.

209
00:15:19,782 --> 00:15:21,215
Scared to kiss me.

210
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:22,908
I just did kiss you.

211
00:15:23,052 --> 00:15:24,417
I mean, for real.

212
00:15:26,655 --> 00:15:28,486
I didn't want to offend you.

213
00:15:33,028 --> 00:15:34,154
You're right.

214
00:15:35,698 --> 00:15:37,461
I don't want to be kissed.

215
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,458
I don't want anything.

216
00:15:47,476 --> 00:15:50,775
But I do want to go with you
next time you take a drive.

217
00:16:06,528 --> 00:16:07,859
I'm missing it.

218
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:09,929
Look at this show!

219
00:16:09,999 --> 00:16:11,261
It's beautiful.

220
00:16:18,941 --> 00:16:20,670
Kate is so serious, isn't she?

221
00:16:22,044 --> 00:16:23,033
Oh, look!

222
00:16:23,412 --> 00:16:24,640
Adorable!

223
00:16:26,382 --> 00:16:27,371
Bravo!

224
00:16:30,753 --> 00:16:31,811
Beautiful!

225
00:16:34,757 --> 00:16:36,748
Wonderful! Wonderful!

226
00:16:38,193 --> 00:16:39,421
Wonderful!

227
00:17:10,893 --> 00:17:12,690
FoLks, this is the captain here.

228
00:17:12,761 --> 00:17:16,561
We're going to make an emergency Landing
at BakersfieLd Airport.

229
00:17:16,865 --> 00:17:19,925
Fasten your seatbeLts before touchdown.
At that time...

230
00:17:20,002 --> 00:17:23,096
...you'LL hear me say the words,
"Brace, brace, brace."

231
00:17:23,172 --> 00:17:26,608
Hi, this is Nan. I'LL caLLyou back
as soon as possibLe.

232
00:17:26,809 --> 00:17:30,575
Get into the crash positions
which your cabin attendants wiLL iLLustrate.

233
00:17:32,781 --> 00:17:35,477
I'm not going to kid you,
it's going to be rough...

234
00:17:36,351 --> 00:17:37,875
...maybe worse than that.

235
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:41,111
Pay attention to what
the cabin attendants say.

236
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:43,257
Good Luck to us aLL.

237
00:17:59,308 --> 00:18:01,503
- May we be excused?
- Bring a bag of chips.

238
00:18:03,745 --> 00:18:05,178
Let's play computer games.

239
00:18:06,348 --> 00:18:07,508
Let them go.

240
00:18:07,616 --> 00:18:10,176
It's a mistake to make them
anything but hamburgers.

241
00:18:10,252 --> 00:18:12,482
Next time we'll have relish and ketchup.

242
00:18:13,856 --> 00:18:16,654
What can you do? I don't mind,
as long as they're happy.

243
00:18:16,725 --> 00:18:19,387
If we'll have Thanksgiving, let's do it right.

244
00:18:22,965 --> 00:18:24,796
Max, don't play superdad.

245
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:29,662
Byron, honey, no.

246
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:33,303
Give me this. Give me this.

247
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:35,741
- This is garbage.
- What're you doing?

248
00:18:35,811 --> 00:18:37,176
Go back to the table and finish!

249
00:18:37,246 --> 00:18:39,578
- Max, calm down.
- I'm perfectly calm.

250
00:18:39,715 --> 00:18:41,876
Listen to me. I'm throwing this out.

251
00:18:42,017 --> 00:18:44,451
When you die, you don't get another life.

252
00:18:45,254 --> 00:18:48,189
- Do you understand?
- It's not real dying. It's pretend.

253
00:18:48,257 --> 00:18:50,521
- I know what dead bodies look like.
- Shut up!

254
00:18:50,626 --> 00:18:52,059
It's going in the garbage.

255
00:18:52,661 --> 00:18:55,687
- He's only a little boy.
- Lf it was up to you, he'd stay a boy.

256
00:18:55,764 --> 00:18:56,856
I don't care!

257
00:18:56,932 --> 00:18:58,160
Don't be cruel.

258
00:18:58,734 --> 00:19:01,828
I don't want him to grow up
a frightened child in a man's body.

259
00:19:01,904 --> 00:19:03,337
He's just fine, Max.

260
00:19:03,405 --> 00:19:05,100
It's you who is in trouble!

261
00:19:05,174 --> 00:19:06,607
Now give the game back.

262
00:19:06,708 --> 00:19:09,438
Or keep on going,
but right out of our lives!

263
00:19:10,646 --> 00:19:14,173
Our son is innocent.
Do you want to crash our marriage?

264
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:17,108
Okay, but don't hurt our son.

265
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,620
I'm not scared to end our marriage.

266
00:19:21,723 --> 00:19:22,917
Neither am I.

267
00:19:25,127 --> 00:19:26,822
Then I'll keep on going.

268
00:19:29,798 --> 00:19:30,924
Good.

269
00:20:28,857 --> 00:20:31,087
- Where to?
- Beautiful downtown Oakland.

270
00:21:16,505 --> 00:21:17,699
Such a shame.

271
00:21:19,308 --> 00:21:23,005
It was going to be gentrified and rebuilt.
Then the recession hit.

272
00:21:23,712 --> 00:21:25,577
The country's falling apart.

273
00:21:27,449 --> 00:21:30,247
The United States is finished.
But you and me...

274
00:21:30,385 --> 00:21:32,080
...we're in peak condition.

275
00:21:51,406 --> 00:21:52,532
You hungry?

276
00:21:54,009 --> 00:21:55,101
In there?

277
00:21:55,677 --> 00:21:57,668
Remember, we're ghosts.

278
00:21:58,647 --> 00:22:00,740
They can't do anything to us.

279
00:22:00,916 --> 00:22:03,510
You're really nuts. You are so crazy.

280
00:22:03,585 --> 00:22:04,916
You should talk.

281
00:22:23,205 --> 00:22:26,572
I can't believe you did that!
I'm not buying you another.

282
00:22:27,042 --> 00:22:28,669
Look at this mess.

283
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:30,969
I've had it. We're going home.

284
00:22:31,179 --> 00:22:32,237
So happy.

285
00:23:43,785 --> 00:23:45,275
Maybe I am a ghost.

286
00:24:01,636 --> 00:24:04,036
I was going to buy him a lot of presents.

287
00:24:09,411 --> 00:24:11,379
Let's do it. Let's buy them.

288
00:24:11,513 --> 00:24:13,037
What did he like?

289
00:24:14,749 --> 00:24:16,046
How about a sword?

290
00:24:16,117 --> 00:24:19,348
My son used to love swords.
He still does, but he's too old to admit it.

291
00:24:19,421 --> 00:24:21,651
- What?
- What would your son like?

292
00:24:23,391 --> 00:24:26,019
Does he play with Legos?
No, he's too young.

293
00:24:27,395 --> 00:24:29,659
Bristle Blocks? Does he have those?

294
00:24:29,731 --> 00:24:32,427
Babies can use them
and older kids like them.

295
00:24:32,534 --> 00:24:34,627
You want me to buy a present for Bubble?

296
00:24:34,836 --> 00:24:36,667
Bubble. Is that really his name?

297
00:24:36,771 --> 00:24:39,001
It's Leonardo. I called him Bubble.

298
00:24:39,441 --> 00:24:41,534
I can't buy him gifts. That's sick.

299
00:24:41,643 --> 00:24:43,941
- Why?
- Because he's dead.

300
00:24:44,546 --> 00:24:46,776
- Of course he's dead.
- You're not serious.

301
00:24:47,249 --> 00:24:49,114
You wouldn't do this to me.

302
00:24:49,518 --> 00:24:51,816
Would you buy a present
for your dead father?

303
00:24:53,955 --> 00:24:55,013
My father?

304
00:24:56,791 --> 00:24:58,418
I never bought him anything.

305
00:24:59,995 --> 00:25:01,053
I'm sorry.

306
00:25:02,063 --> 00:25:04,827
I didn't mean it. I just don't think
it's a good idea.

307
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,765
I made him something in school.

308
00:25:07,335 --> 00:25:08,563
Carved his name in wood.

309
00:25:08,637 --> 00:25:12,129
Made a little nameplate
that you put on your desk.

310
00:25:13,808 --> 00:25:15,605
I was 13 when he died and...

311
00:25:17,012 --> 00:25:19,572
...never had a chance to buy him
a real present.

312
00:25:19,948 --> 00:25:21,074
Let's do it.

313
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:23,379
Let's buy presents for the dead.

314
00:25:23,885 --> 00:25:26,149
Come on. Let's buy presents for the dead.

315
00:25:26,454 --> 00:25:28,285
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.

316
00:25:28,356 --> 00:25:29,482
Come on!

317
00:25:30,492 --> 00:25:32,255
Who'll we give them to?

318
00:25:35,564 --> 00:25:39,500
He liked to build things: Shelves, chairs.
He made our dining-room table.

319
00:25:39,768 --> 00:25:42,794
Sometimes he'd give me a hammer,
let me do the easy stuff.

320
00:25:47,409 --> 00:25:49,741
This is it. This is what he'd like.

321
00:25:50,412 --> 00:25:53,779
Every time we came into a hardware store,
he'd stop in front of these.

322
00:25:54,449 --> 00:25:56,474
It wasn't as magnificent as this one.

323
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,709
He'd be...

324
00:26:00,388 --> 00:26:01,412
...totally silent...

325
00:26:04,192 --> 00:26:05,523
...and then he'd say...

326
00:26:07,729 --> 00:26:09,458
..."I'd like to have that"...

327
00:26:10,231 --> 00:26:11,858
...and walk away.

328
00:26:14,169 --> 00:26:17,229
Only thing I ever heard him say he wanted.
Excuse me.

329
00:26:17,706 --> 00:26:18,934
Excuse me!

330
00:26:19,708 --> 00:26:21,175
I'd like to buy this for my father.

331
00:26:21,343 --> 00:26:23,607
That's nice. I'll take care of that.

332
00:26:28,316 --> 00:26:30,580
I've got to get him a monster.
He loves them.

333
00:26:30,752 --> 00:26:32,379
I'll find him something.

334
00:26:40,261 --> 00:26:41,193
Come here.

335
00:26:41,296 --> 00:26:43,127
Look at this. This is great.

336
00:26:49,304 --> 00:26:50,703
Do you mind?

337
00:26:51,706 --> 00:26:52,764
Sorry.

338
00:26:55,677 --> 00:26:59,408
Look what I have for us.
A beautiful bevy of desserts.

339
00:26:59,547 --> 00:27:00,377
Now...

340
00:27:01,049 --> 00:27:01,913
...this.

341
00:27:03,451 --> 00:27:06,147
- Don't want any.
- We could use it as a paperweight.

342
00:27:06,688 --> 00:27:07,746
I want that.

343
00:27:07,989 --> 00:27:10,048
This is the only thing you can't have.

344
00:27:12,127 --> 00:27:14,288
Now I have several other magical...

345
00:27:15,363 --> 00:27:17,456
I have a magic mushroom for you.

346
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,628
Or better yet...

347
00:27:20,535 --> 00:27:22,298
...the beautiful simplicity...

348
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:24,461
...of a ripe strawberry.

349
00:27:48,763 --> 00:27:50,025
Let's dance.

350
00:27:51,466 --> 00:27:52,490
Come on.

351
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,828
I don't dance.

352
00:27:54,035 --> 00:27:55,093
Come on!

353
00:27:55,804 --> 00:27:56,828
Pick up.

354
00:28:03,344 --> 00:28:04,333
Hold on!

355
00:28:06,481 --> 00:28:08,381
Oh, please, please, please.

356
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:30,601
Good night.

357
00:28:30,939 --> 00:28:32,270
So I'll pick you up?

358
00:28:33,842 --> 00:28:35,901
My goodness, it's night.

359
00:28:47,122 --> 00:28:48,612
Where are we going?

360
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:54,157
We could disappear.

361
00:29:09,244 --> 00:29:10,711
You all right?

362
00:29:13,114 --> 00:29:14,479
What's wrong?

363
00:29:19,454 --> 00:29:20,512
What?

364
00:29:23,458 --> 00:29:25,653
There's something I have to tell you.

365
00:29:26,561 --> 00:29:29,189
You got to promise
you'll never tell anyone.

366
00:29:30,498 --> 00:29:31,590
All right.

367
00:29:47,048 --> 00:29:48,572
All right, calm down now.

368
00:29:49,584 --> 00:29:51,017
What is it?

369
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:53,078
What?

370
00:29:54,355 --> 00:29:57,051
I want to tell you something
that nobody knows.

371
00:29:58,092 --> 00:29:59,650
Do you remember...

372
00:30:00,161 --> 00:30:04,325
...just when we touched ground and
it was like we were going to land okay?

373
00:30:10,305 --> 00:30:11,294
What?

374
00:30:15,677 --> 00:30:17,201
I let go of Bubble.

375
00:30:19,814 --> 00:30:23,215
I had him in my lap.
I looked at the road and...

376
00:30:23,451 --> 00:30:26,852
...I thought we were going to be safe,
and the wheels bumped.

377
00:30:27,021 --> 00:30:28,716
I opened my arms.

378
00:30:30,124 --> 00:30:32,786
I was safe in my belt, but he wasn't.

379
00:30:32,927 --> 00:30:35,191
Oh, I see. It was your fault?

380
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:36,727
It wasn't the accident?

381
00:30:36,798 --> 00:30:40,029
- I wasn't holding him!
- You killed your baby?

382
00:30:41,069 --> 00:30:42,627
And the lawyer...

383
00:30:42,737 --> 00:30:45,604
- Brillstein?
...I didn't tell him the truth.

384
00:30:46,107 --> 00:30:48,940
I understand. So you're also a liar?

385
00:30:50,078 --> 00:30:54,947
Yes, I lied! I lied to Father Conti.
I lied in the confessional.

386
00:30:55,016 --> 00:30:57,484
I lied to the whole church!

387
00:30:57,752 --> 00:30:59,777
- It wasn't your fault.
- Oh, my God.

388
00:30:59,854 --> 00:31:01,515
Oh, my God!

389
00:31:01,589 --> 00:31:03,489
Carla, it's not your fault.

390
00:31:06,027 --> 00:31:07,551
"Hail, Mary, full of grace...

391
00:31:07,629 --> 00:31:10,393
"...the Lord is with Thee.
Blessed art Thou amongst women...

392
00:31:10,465 --> 00:31:12,592
"...and blessed is the fruit
of Thy womb Jesus."

393
00:31:12,667 --> 00:31:15,602
Carla, I didn't mean
that you killed your baby.

394
00:31:17,805 --> 00:31:19,705
Carla, you're not to blame.

395
00:31:21,409 --> 00:31:23,377
You couldn't have held on to your baby.

396
00:31:23,444 --> 00:31:25,878
We were going hundreds of miles an hour!

397
00:31:30,818 --> 00:31:32,877
Of course you think it's your fault.

398
00:31:33,187 --> 00:31:36,350
God gave you a child.
It was your job to keep him safe.

399
00:31:36,491 --> 00:31:38,550
But it's not your fault!

400
00:31:39,294 --> 00:31:42,457
Stop it now! Come on, stop it!
That's enough!

401
00:31:49,704 --> 00:31:50,693
Oh, shit.

402
00:31:58,913 --> 00:32:00,278
Oh, shit.

403
00:32:04,752 --> 00:32:06,083
Now what have I done?

404
00:32:31,412 --> 00:32:33,175
Come on now.
I want you to get in the back.

405
00:32:35,083 --> 00:32:36,015
Come on.

406
00:32:38,486 --> 00:32:39,612
Come on.

407
00:32:39,721 --> 00:32:41,052
Come on now.

408
00:32:41,589 --> 00:32:42,613
Come on.

409
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:50,425
Just get in the back now.

410
00:33:03,644 --> 00:33:05,202
This is your baby.

411
00:33:06,047 --> 00:33:08,345
No, hold it upright, like this.

412
00:33:08,416 --> 00:33:11,214
I know it doesn't look like a baby.
It looks like a toolbox.

413
00:33:11,285 --> 00:33:12,411
It is a toolbox.

414
00:33:12,487 --> 00:33:15,081
I want you to pretend
that this is your baby.

415
00:33:15,156 --> 00:33:16,646
Pretend it's Bubble.

416
00:33:17,458 --> 00:33:20,222
Now this is your chance to hold on tight...

417
00:33:20,428 --> 00:33:21,827
...to save him.

418
00:33:53,628 --> 00:33:55,323
Hold on to Bubble!

419
00:33:56,164 --> 00:33:57,688
As tight as you can!

420
00:34:08,209 --> 00:34:10,871
Pray to God to give you the strength
to save your baby.

421
00:34:18,853 --> 00:34:20,548
Hold on to your baby!

422
00:34:24,792 --> 00:34:26,521
Holy Mary, Mother of God!

423
00:34:26,627 --> 00:34:29,596
Pray for us now
and at the hour of our death!

424
00:35:11,372 --> 00:35:13,397
Right behind you. Careful, please.

425
00:35:22,850 --> 00:35:25,580
Mrs. Rodrigo, how are you doing?

426
00:35:25,653 --> 00:35:26,551
I'm okay.

427
00:35:26,621 --> 00:35:28,486
It's whiplash. I was with Max.

428
00:35:28,556 --> 00:35:32,014
I know. He's in intensive care.
He'll be all right.

429
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,691
Just between us...

430
00:35:33,761 --> 00:35:34,955
...what happened?

431
00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:37,392
He was showing me something.

432
00:35:37,465 --> 00:35:39,956
What? That brick walls are hard?

433
00:35:41,536 --> 00:35:43,595
How'd you get here so fast?

434
00:35:44,338 --> 00:35:46,898
My beeper went off,
I was just two blocks away.

435
00:35:47,041 --> 00:35:49,601
I don't know. I've been really lucky lately.

436
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:52,044
I mean, I know it's terrible...

437
00:35:52,113 --> 00:35:54,377
...to talk about luck
when you've suffered so.

438
00:35:54,448 --> 00:35:56,075
Have you seen a doctor yet?

439
00:35:57,852 --> 00:35:58,819
Are you okay?

440
00:35:58,886 --> 00:36:00,080
Yes, I'm fine.

441
00:36:00,521 --> 00:36:03,513
- What happened?
- Mr. Klein drove into a brick wall.

442
00:36:05,459 --> 00:36:06,949
You don't understand.

443
00:36:07,128 --> 00:36:09,562
The flight attendant told me
to hold Bubble.

444
00:36:10,431 --> 00:36:12,865
I thought I didn't hold him tight enough.

445
00:36:12,934 --> 00:36:16,597
I wasn't sure my hands were clasped
when we hit.

446
00:36:17,838 --> 00:36:20,068
Be careful about what we're not sure of.

447
00:36:21,709 --> 00:36:23,609
I thought I could save him.

448
00:36:24,245 --> 00:36:25,837
Max showed me I couldn't.

449
00:36:25,913 --> 00:36:28,643
- There was no way.
- He crashed the car on purpose?

450
00:36:28,749 --> 00:36:29,875
Yes, to show me.

451
00:36:29,951 --> 00:36:30,849
That's it.

452
00:36:30,918 --> 00:36:33,284
That fucking nut ain't coming close to you!

453
00:36:33,387 --> 00:36:35,787
- Let me talk to you.
- It's out of control.

454
00:36:35,957 --> 00:36:39,449
Listen, our case is good. Actually,
we could improve our numbers here.

455
00:36:53,207 --> 00:36:54,674
You must be Jonah.

456
00:36:55,576 --> 00:36:58,477
I'm a friend of your daddy's.
Is your mom home?

457
00:36:58,879 --> 00:37:00,813
Yeah, come in. Mom!

458
00:37:08,389 --> 00:37:10,414
- A woman's here to see you.
- I know.

459
00:37:10,558 --> 00:37:11,616
Go to your room.

460
00:37:11,692 --> 00:37:13,182
Go to your room!

461
00:37:40,087 --> 00:37:41,213
I'm Carla.

462
00:37:41,956 --> 00:37:43,184
I know who you are.

463
00:37:46,994 --> 00:37:49,189
This is a very nice house that you have.

464
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:53,794
Please sit down.

465
00:37:54,135 --> 00:37:55,124
Thank you.

466
00:38:04,812 --> 00:38:07,042
I'm sorry to bother you like this...

467
00:38:07,148 --> 00:38:09,912
...but I thought that it would be good
if we talked.

468
00:38:17,658 --> 00:38:19,125
I called the hospital.

469
00:38:19,427 --> 00:38:21,895
They said that Max is doing okay.

470
00:38:22,897 --> 00:38:24,888
I don't think he's doing okay.

471
00:38:33,074 --> 00:38:34,268
How are you?

472
00:38:35,142 --> 00:38:36,074
I'm okay.

473
00:38:36,243 --> 00:38:37,972
I really wasn't hurt.

474
00:38:41,882 --> 00:38:44,442
You know, I came by because I...

475
00:38:45,086 --> 00:38:47,452
...I just wanted to say, you know...

476
00:38:49,757 --> 00:38:53,022
...I can imagine what you must be feeling...

477
00:38:53,094 --> 00:38:54,652
...about what has happened.

478
00:38:54,762 --> 00:38:55,854
Really?

479
00:38:58,766 --> 00:38:59,733
You can?

480
00:39:02,903 --> 00:39:05,235
You have every right to be angry with me.

481
00:39:05,339 --> 00:39:07,136
I'm not angry with you.

482
00:39:07,641 --> 00:39:10,166
Why should I be? Wasn't it Max's idea?

483
00:39:10,244 --> 00:39:13,611
- What he did was crazy.
- He must be very much in love with you...

484
00:39:13,681 --> 00:39:15,546
...to risk his life for you.
- It's not like that.

485
00:39:15,616 --> 00:39:16,708
Isn't that love?

486
00:39:16,784 --> 00:39:17,580
No.

487
00:39:25,726 --> 00:39:27,557
Look, I'm sorry.

488
00:39:29,029 --> 00:39:31,020
I didn't come to argue with you.

489
00:39:31,999 --> 00:39:34,092
I think I better go. I'm sorry.

490
00:39:34,969 --> 00:39:36,163
Please stay.

491
00:39:52,686 --> 00:39:54,847
I am very sorry about your little boy.

492
00:40:01,495 --> 00:40:02,553
Thank you.

493
00:40:09,437 --> 00:40:10,495
You know...

494
00:40:12,873 --> 00:40:14,238
...when he died...

495
00:40:14,975 --> 00:40:16,465
...I had nothing.

496
00:40:18,512 --> 00:40:20,207
I couldn't feel anything.

497
00:40:25,486 --> 00:40:27,215
Now I can feel something.

498
00:40:28,389 --> 00:40:31,620
I can feel something inside
besides the pain for Bubble.

499
00:40:34,028 --> 00:40:35,620
That's because of Max.

500
00:40:36,564 --> 00:40:37,997
He would talk to me.

501
00:40:38,065 --> 00:40:40,761
He'd talk to me like nobody else ever has.

502
00:40:41,469 --> 00:40:43,994
We would have these great conversations...

503
00:40:44,104 --> 00:40:47,403
...and they were weird,
but they were so exciting and...

504
00:40:50,811 --> 00:40:52,403
It's not what you think.

505
00:40:53,881 --> 00:40:55,143
He's my friend.

506
00:40:56,450 --> 00:40:59,283
He's my best friend.
It's like God sent him to me.

507
00:40:59,386 --> 00:41:01,479
It's like he sent me my own angel.

508
00:41:06,961 --> 00:41:08,724
Let me be honest with you.

509
00:41:12,733 --> 00:41:15,497
Maybe this wonderful friendship
that you have...

510
00:41:16,303 --> 00:41:17,964
...might have helped you.

511
00:41:18,772 --> 00:41:20,501
But it hasn't helped Max.

512
00:41:22,209 --> 00:41:24,006
Maybe our marriage is over...

513
00:41:25,279 --> 00:41:28,680
...but I have a son
and I want him to have a father.

514
00:41:33,587 --> 00:41:35,521
Max is not an angel.

515
00:41:36,690 --> 00:41:37,679
He's a man.

516
00:41:39,693 --> 00:41:41,490
He cannot survive up there.

517
00:42:06,587 --> 00:42:08,145
Hey, you.

518
00:42:08,289 --> 00:42:09,881
How're you doing?

519
00:42:10,991 --> 00:42:13,050
I got you these chocolates.

520
00:42:13,127 --> 00:42:15,118
That's what they give patients.

521
00:42:15,963 --> 00:42:16,952
Here.

522
00:42:18,465 --> 00:42:20,126
- How's your head?
- Hurts!

523
00:42:23,203 --> 00:42:24,192
I just...

524
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:28,665
I've really wanted to tell you how much...

525
00:42:35,149 --> 00:42:37,617
I just wanted to say
how wonderful you are.

526
00:42:38,953 --> 00:42:40,443
You look happy.

527
00:42:42,389 --> 00:42:44,949
You know, it's probably
because Manny moved out.

528
00:42:45,793 --> 00:42:47,021
I told him to.

529
00:42:47,461 --> 00:42:49,224
Are you all right with that?

530
00:42:51,932 --> 00:42:53,092
You know...

531
00:42:53,367 --> 00:42:55,198
...I visited Bubble's grave.

532
00:42:57,037 --> 00:42:59,096
For the first time, it was okay.

533
00:43:00,841 --> 00:43:01,865
I'm glad.

534
00:43:06,814 --> 00:43:07,940
But you know...

535
00:43:09,683 --> 00:43:12,243
...things can't go back
to the way that they were.

536
00:43:13,754 --> 00:43:15,187
You know what I mean?

537
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:21,155
I want you to go home, Max.

538
00:43:22,463 --> 00:43:24,158
I want you to live again.

539
00:43:26,266 --> 00:43:27,927
I'm not a ghost anymore.

540
00:43:31,171 --> 00:43:32,604
I can't get back.

541
00:43:34,441 --> 00:43:35,635
Yes, you can.

542
00:43:36,844 --> 00:43:38,175
I don't want to.

543
00:43:43,684 --> 00:43:45,379
I wish I could help you.

544
00:43:48,489 --> 00:43:50,184
We could disappear, Carla.

545
00:43:53,761 --> 00:43:55,058
I can't anymore.

546
00:43:57,564 --> 00:43:58,553
I'm back.

547
00:44:00,267 --> 00:44:03,134
I want to try living
on planet Earth for a while.

548
00:44:05,906 --> 00:44:08,204
You can't save everybody, Max.

549
00:44:10,944 --> 00:44:13,174
You got to try taking care of yourself.

550
00:44:20,854 --> 00:44:22,219
Say good-bye, Max.

551
00:44:24,024 --> 00:44:26,254
Good-bye? Why do we have
to say good-bye?

552
00:44:30,764 --> 00:44:32,322
It has to be that way.

553
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:35,192
I don't want to say good-bye.

554
00:44:37,771 --> 00:44:38,760
Just...

555
00:44:41,141 --> 00:44:43,234
Just say it like it means nothing.

556
00:44:45,479 --> 00:44:46,707
Good-bye, Max.

557
00:45:00,661 --> 00:45:01,787
Please, Max.

558
00:45:02,863 --> 00:45:03,887
Say it.

559
00:45:07,901 --> 00:45:09,334
Good-bye, Carla.

560
00:47:57,404 --> 00:48:00,202
"The soul comes to the end
of it's long journey...

561
00:48:00,941 --> 00:48:02,704
"...and naked and alone...

562
00:48:03,377 --> 00:48:05,368
"...draws near to the divine."

563
00:49:04,871 --> 00:49:06,133
How're you feeling?

564
00:49:10,110 --> 00:49:11,134
Okay.

565
00:49:13,413 --> 00:49:15,643
101.4.

566
00:49:17,884 --> 00:49:18,873
Let's see.

567
00:49:29,429 --> 00:49:30,896
Are you going to stay?

568
00:49:32,599 --> 00:49:34,260
I don't know. We'll see.

569
00:49:38,505 --> 00:49:40,234
Sorry about the video game.

570
00:49:41,608 --> 00:49:43,508
It's okay. You didn't break it.

571
00:49:45,512 --> 00:49:46,376
Good.

572
00:51:04,091 --> 00:51:05,422
What is it?

573
00:51:10,630 --> 00:51:12,461
I want you to save me.

574
00:51:36,490 --> 00:51:37,957
These are for you.

575
00:51:38,892 --> 00:51:40,359
You're here! Great.

576
00:51:40,427 --> 00:51:42,486
Listen, it may be premature.

577
00:51:42,629 --> 00:51:46,759
I don't want to jinx it but I think
I'll have it all locked up tomorrow.

578
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:50,428
So, champagne, assorted goodies.
A little celebration.

579
00:51:51,037 --> 00:51:52,664
It's an incredible story.

580
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:56,832
Because of your suicide attempt,
don't argue that...

581
00:51:57,144 --> 00:52:01,342
That's how I presented it, that you were
suffering from post-traumatic stress...

582
00:52:01,448 --> 00:52:05,145
...and that they were going to be
on the hook if you killed yourself.

583
00:52:05,418 --> 00:52:06,942
I know, I'm terrible.

584
00:52:08,021 --> 00:52:09,318
What a situation.

585
00:52:09,389 --> 00:52:10,947
What am I going to do?

586
00:52:11,658 --> 00:52:13,319
It's incredible!

587
00:52:13,727 --> 00:52:18,494
Anyway, today I hondled with InterCity's
lawyer for two hours and we got close...

588
00:52:18,932 --> 00:52:23,232
...really close, to big dollars for you,
Mrs. Gordon and Mrs. Rodrigo.

589
00:52:23,870 --> 00:52:26,361
But I think we're going to make out
like bandits.

590
00:52:26,606 --> 00:52:29,097
I know, I'm horrible, but listen to this:

591
00:52:30,810 --> 00:52:32,539
An hour after the call...

592
00:52:32,612 --> 00:52:35,775
...from the airline lawyer,
I get one from the insurance carrier.

593
00:52:36,449 --> 00:52:37,746
What a situation!

594
00:52:37,817 --> 00:52:40,615
I'm mean, I know.
I'm terrible to take advantage...

595
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:43,484
...but there's been a fuck up
in their communication.

596
00:52:43,590 --> 00:52:47,617
They both think they're the one
who's been designated to deal with me.

597
00:52:48,361 --> 00:52:49,692
So I played dumb.

598
00:52:50,931 --> 00:52:55,129
Started doing numbers with
the insurance guy and his offer is higher!

599
00:52:57,404 --> 00:52:59,304
Millions, we're talking millions!

600
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:01,898
Oh, shit!

601
00:53:11,084 --> 00:53:12,244
This is it.

602
00:53:12,819 --> 00:53:14,753
This is the moment of my death.

603
00:53:22,395 --> 00:53:23,794
We'll make it, Max.

604
00:53:23,863 --> 00:53:25,455
He's going to bring us in.

605
00:53:25,565 --> 00:53:28,193
- He'll bring us in.
- There's a boy alone up there.

606
00:53:29,369 --> 00:53:31,166
I'm going to sit with him.

607
00:53:33,673 --> 00:53:35,231
It's going to be okay.

608
00:55:21,147 --> 00:55:22,512
Everything's okay.

609
00:55:31,458 --> 00:55:33,085
Now, put your head down.

610
00:55:35,762 --> 00:55:37,161
Close your eyes.

611
00:55:37,764 --> 00:55:39,493
It'll be over soon.

612
00:55:40,867 --> 00:55:42,835
Everything's wonderful.

613
00:57:02,148 --> 00:57:03,945
In the kitchen, there is a phone!

614
00:57:04,717 --> 00:57:07,049
It's an emergency! It's an allergic reaction!

615
00:57:14,327 --> 00:57:17,023
Stop it! What's happening? Dad!

616
00:57:54,567 --> 00:57:55,727
No, Max! No!

617
00:58:55,328 --> 00:58:56,693
I'm alive!

618
00:59:00,567 --> 00:59:01,625
I'm alive!

619
00:59:17,250 --> 00:59:18,478
I'm alive!

620
00:59:19,478 --> 00:59:29,478
