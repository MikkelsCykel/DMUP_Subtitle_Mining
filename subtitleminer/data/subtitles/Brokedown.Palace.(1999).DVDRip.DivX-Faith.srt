1
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,100
They've scheduled the hearing
for the Burmese.

2
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:50,200
- Where are you going?
- They should have a copy.

3
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,500
You're crazy.
It's pouring out there.

4
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:55,900
I know.

5
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:29,900
 I'm not sure where to start.
You're probably fast-forwarding already.

6
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,900
We shouldn 't be here.

7
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:36,000
We're from Ohio. A dinky
little town called Upland.

8
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,700
I'm Alice Marano.
My best friend is Darlene Davis.

9
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,800
- I don't know about Hawaii anymore.
- What?

10
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:46,600
It's like a bunch of tourists
on family vacations.

11
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:50,800
We met as babies, crawled to each
other on a neighbor's lawn.

12
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,600
That's what my mom used to say.

13
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Get closer to your sister.

14
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:59,600
Teachers said I was the bad one,
Darlene was good.

15
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,200
We didn 't care. It was a joke to us.
We knew how we were.

16
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,000
It was always the two of us.

17
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:10,500
Doug, could you take
a picture of me and Alice?

18
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,000
Darlene was going to college.

19
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:16,400
We decided to have a knockout
trip together.

20
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,300
Celebrate our sorrows. After that...

21
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:24,000
...for the first time in our lives,
we wouldn 't be together.

22
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:28,500
So it had to be amazing.

23
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,400
Memorable.

24
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,200
Hawaii seemed so middle-class.
Like our parents ' version of fun.

25
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,700
I wanted it to be special.

26
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,400
Not that she would ever forget me.

27
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:51,300
Then someone mentioned Thailand.
It was as simple as that.

28
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:55,300
Strange how little things
make big things happen.

29
00:03:55,700 --> 00:04:00,300
Ferg told us his brother spent
a summer in Bangkok for under $500.

30
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:03,200
I learned that Thailand means freedom.

31
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:08,000
A country named after
the exact thing we were looking for.

32
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,300
- I thought you wanted to go.
- I do. It's my dad.

33
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:16,200
- You're so afraid of him.
- He's already being a dick...

34
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:21,300
...about my off-campus apartment.
Now I'm going to Bangkok.

35
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:26,400
- What'd you tell your dad?
- I said you were going, he said okay.

36
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,800
He doesn't care anyway...

37
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:32,400
...as long as I still have
my exciting career.

38
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,800
Just don't tell your dad.

39
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:38,200
Let him think we're in Hawaii.

40
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,800
It's only 11 days.
How's he gonna find out?

41
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:51,400
Dar worried about lying
for nine hours of the flight.

42
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:55,900
By the 24th hour,
she was too tired to care.

43
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,800
It took forever to find the hotel.

44
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,800
Funny what forever used to feel like.

45
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,500
This is it?

46
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:19,100
- Doesn't look royal.
- How much royal do you want for $6?

47
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,300
Thank you very much.

48
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,700
Thank you.

49
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,100
Thank you.

50
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,000
- What is it?
- Oh, God!

51
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,100
It's a huge roach!

52
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Thais have so much respect
for their monarch...

53
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:59,400
...that up until
Rama III changed the law...

54
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:02,500
...no one could utter
His Majesty's name.

55
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:21,600
Buying and then releasing
captive animals...

56
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,200
...is also considered meritorious.

57
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:28,900
A number of vendors around Bangkok
sell birds for this purpose.

58
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,800
- God, enough with this heat.
- Exactly.

59
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:49,700
I'm tempted to jump in the river.
How bad can raw sewage be?

60
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:55,000
They dump human waste, bathe
and drink, all in one river.

61
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,800
Give me that geek book.

62
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,500
Tell me you brought a bathing suit.

63
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,500
- But I'm not going in there.
- Come here.

64
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:22,200
 What if we're caught?
Go in like you own the place.

65
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:34,100
Welcome to first class.

66
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,800
Something to eat or drink?

67
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:41,100
- Two of those, please.
- What room number?

68
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:44,000
- We'll just pay cash.
- 414.

69
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,500
Come on. They don't care.

70
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,300
Lotion.

71
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,400
Thank you.

72
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,500
That's me.

73
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,500
I'm gonna be her.

74
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,000
I'm her divorce lawyer.

75
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,700
- I want both houses and the nanny.
- You've got to have her.

76
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,500
- The girls are crazy about Helga.
- Let's make him pay.

77
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:37,700
Damn right.

78
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:38,900
Exactly.

79
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,000
You say room number 414?

80
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:44,800
414? That man number 414.

81
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:48,400
I was sure...
Oh, it's 416. I'm sorry.

82
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:51,400
- You stay here?
- Our room's up there.

83
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,500
What's your name?

84
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,900
This is really inappropriate.
Our room...

85
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,400
God, it's right up there.

86
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:07,500
- What's your name?
- Room 333.

87
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:10,900
Bloody hell, I can't take
you two anywhere.

88
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,100
Sorry, mate. It's been a bit
of a blur of hotel rooms.

89
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,500
- Cheers.
- Thank you.

90
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:24,500
I've got to shoot through.
You're scared straight now?

91
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,500
Excuse me.

92
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,700
- We'll pay you back.
- No worries, it's fine.

93
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,600
- Can we get you a drink?
- It's the least we could do.

94
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,600
Okay.

95
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:49,500
I'll take it for the wanker in 333
who left his key in the men's room.

96
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,500
Come on.

97
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:59,400
But the man said it was solid wood.

98
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
What?

99
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,400
Oh, great.

100
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:06,400
Don't worry. You're in the fake Rolex
capital of the world.

101
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:11,100
- Some look better than the real ones.
- So you're new in town.

102
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:15,100
- Where are you from?
- Australia. But I'm never there.

103
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:19,200
I do seminars for a software
company all over Asia.

104
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,000
I do bugger all most days.
Getting paid to sun-bake.

105
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:26,000
I'd kill for a gig like that.

106
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:29,300
Oh, God. Quick, eat rice.

107
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,700
It makes it go away.

108
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,700
Eat more. It's like...

109
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:37,100
...your mouth's gonna explode.

110
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,500
Nobody's laughing.

111
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,900
Come on. Have some more.

112
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:17,800
- You forgot your drink.
- I've had enough.

113
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,500
Beautiful night, isn't it?

114
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,800
Yeah.

115
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:03,000
Is this okay?
Are you okay with it?

116
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,900
Why would I care?
He's cute. Go for it.

117
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:08,700
Take notes. I want details.

118
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,700
I didn't know if you had keys.

119
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,900
- Where are you going?
- To the market. Coming?

120
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:39,200
No, I've got to get some sleep.

121
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,500
Sure. Okay.

122
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,300
- He wants to take us to Hong Kong.
- Us?

123
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,900
For the weekend.

124
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,700
He has to go on business and...

125
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:55,300
Oh, God. Alice, it was great.

126
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,400
And weird. And intense.

127
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:01,100
- I'm not going to Hong Kong.
- It's just a day or two.

128
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,900
- The flight's only two hours.
- What about the beaches?

129
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,200
Please?

130
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:09,500
I really like him.

131
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,500
Then go. I'm not mad.
But I'm not going.

132
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,000
Go. Have a great, weird time.

133
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,900
Don't I always do shit
like this for you?

134
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,300
Please?

135
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,800
Okay, Dar.

136
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,100
I like the black one.

137
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,900
It's nice. It suits you.

138
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:04,600
Did Darlene tell you about Hong Kong?

139
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,600
Yeah, she might have.

140
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:11,400
I'm flying out there this afternoon.
You guys can fly out tomorrow.

141
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:14,000
I'll get all my business done...

142
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:17,000
...then we can just have a good time.

143
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,200
Come on. I want you to come.

144
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:24,100
I've made the ultimate sacrifice.

145
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:28,200
One first-class ticket
cashed in for three economy.

146
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:34,700
You have no idea what you've
ultimately sacrificed.

147
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,000
I'll get it. How much?

148
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:06,400
What did you get?
You were gone so long.

149
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,400
I got you something.

150
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,800
It's beautiful.

151
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,300
Thank you.

152
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,700
Thank you for coming to Hong Kong.

153
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:27,400
They said on CNN that it's gonna
be pouring in Hong Kong.

154
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:30,000
You still sure you wanna go?

155
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,600
We'll buy umbrellas.

156
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,900
My top got all wet.

157
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,600
Alice, hurry, we're gonna be late.

158
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:03,100
- Does this look okay?
- Perfect. I'll see you downstairs.

159
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:06,100
- Okay?
- Okay!

160
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:18,200
- Who is it?
- It's Manat.

161
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,500
Your bags?

162
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,700
Okay. Just give me a minute.

163
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:45,300
- What have you been doing?
- I had to brush my hair.

164
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,600
Excuse me.

165
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,700
We're gonna be late.

166
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,500
Shit. They're boarding.

167
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,200
Sorry.

168
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,600
Alice!

169
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:04,900
- Where are we going?
- I don't know.

170
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:28,500
I'm an American.
May I telephone the Embassy?

171
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:31,300
- Darlene!
- Where are you taking her?

172
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Who gave you the narcotics?

173
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:47,300
- I want an attorney.
- It was your friend?

174
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,800
I'm American. I have the right
to an attorney.

175
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,700
Yes. And one telephone call too.

176
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,100
Excuse me.

177
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:57,900
Excuse me?

178
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:06,000
I have to go to the bathroom.

179
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,700
Please, take me to the bathroom.

180
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:31,300
You sign.

181
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:34,800
This is in Thai. I can't sign this.

182
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:36,500
You sign.

183
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:39,300
I don't speak your language.

184
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:45,000
Darlene Davis?

185
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,400
I'm Chief Detective Jagkrit.

186
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,200
Have you been here all day?

187
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:56,100
Yeah.

188
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,700
The bathroom is down the hall.

189
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:13,500
- Why were you going to Hong Kong?
- Just for fun.

190
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,000
You okay?

191
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:44,700
No.

192
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,800
No, Darlene, I'm definitely not okay.

193
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:52,900
We can't fall apart now.
Someone's gonna come for us.

194
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:56,700
- Who knows we're here?
- The embassy knows.

195
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,400
The detective called them for us.

196
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:02,900
Sure he did. Then he called
the president.

197
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:13,500
They're trying to drive me nuts:
"Sign. Your girlfriend confessed."

198
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:17,500
- They said I confessed?
- They said you signed a confession.

199
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:21,800
Like we're going to sign
something we can't read.

200
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:27,900
You didn't sign anything, did you?

201
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:30,900
It was my statement...

202
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,500
...saying we were innocent.

203
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:37,000
Was it in English or Thai?

204
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,300
Was it in English or Thai?

205
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,300
If they change what I said,
I'll tell them.

206
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,600
Clearly, I can't read Thai.

207
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:49,900
I'll just tell them
it's not what I said.

208
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:51,500
God, I'm sorry.

209
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:56,100
I'm just not used to being tossed
into a filthy, disgusting jail.

210
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:00,700
Are you gonna make this all my fault?

211
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,700
Is that what you think?

212
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:07,200
- You were carrying the bag.
- You packed it.

213
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:10,100
You were the last one alone with it.

214
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,800
Okay, so we're innocent.

215
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,700
So there's nothing to worry about.

216
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:24,100
Once my dad
gets to hear about this...

217
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,200
God, he'll know what to do.

218
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,400
Hello?

219
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,300
Yeah.

220
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:46,700
You've got the wrong Mr. Davis.

221
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:49,200
My daughter's off in Hawaii.

222
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,000
Alice Marano.

223
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:00,700
Oh, my God.

224
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,400
Oh, my God.

225
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:11,000
I'm sorry, but it appears
there is no Nick Parks.

226
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:15,500
But I went to his hotel.
The Queen Victoria Hotel.

227
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:20,800
We sent someone. No Parks registered
as far back as three months.

228
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:24,300
Nor is there a plane reservation
in his name.

229
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,700
No Nick Parks.

230
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
But that's impossible. Check again.

231
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:33,300
We're quite thorough,
and of course we'll keep at it.

232
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,700
At this point, I must advise you
to consult with an attorney.

233
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,700
I'm sorry.

234
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:46,500
If you repent, plead guilty
and ask for mercy...

235
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:48,800
...the judge will be lenient.

236
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,000
No more than 40 years.

237
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:52,600
I'm not guilty!

238
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:56,400
If you plead not guilty
and don't prove...

239
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,500
...you get life sentence.

240
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,900
It's just until the trial.

241
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:08,100
You wash.

242
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,300
Dar, come on.

243
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,600

I wasn 't even that scared at first.

244
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:38,900
I'd had worse haircuts.

245
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:44,100
I believed if we could hold on
until the trial, it'd be over...

246
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,700
...like a nightmare.

247
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:51,500
I didn 't know it was all rigged here.

248
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:54,600
Like those birds you buy to set free.

249
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:58,300
They're really trained
to fly back to their cages.

250
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:03,300
Because that's all freedom is:
An illusion.

251
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:41,300
Waiter, there's a bug in my snot.

252
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,800
The fruit looks okay, though.

253
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,700
You like? Go take.

254
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:51,600
Thanks a lot.

255
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,800
Kneel down.

256
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:04,700
- Like you're praying.
- She...

257
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,200
Do the down-facing dog.

258
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:08,700
Make it super-size.

259
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:13,200
She said we could get some fruit.

260
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:45,800
- You have to earn the food.
- How do you earn it?

261
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:49,400
Put in your time. Take one of those.

262
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:07,400
I was so high, I didn't notice
my visa had run out.

263
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:10,400
I couldn't pay the fine to leave.

264
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:15,300
A bloke I met said he'd pay the fine
and give me some pocket money.

265
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:19,800
I just had to take some packets
and stuff them inside me.

266
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:23,000
You're telling that
smack-in-the-box tale again?

267
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,800
Yankee girl.

268
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:32,300
- What's with her?
- She thinks you're fun to piss off.

269
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:37,000
You're the new show
at the brokedown palace.

270
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:41,200
- When's checkout time?
- Check out anytime, man.

271
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:45,300
You find freedom here
and in here...

272
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,400
...and in here.

273
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,000
- What's with her?
- She thought she'd get pardoned.

274
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:44,100
Everybody thinks they'll get a pardon
from the crown. Makes me sick.

275
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:48,700
Addicted to fantasy. That road
leads straight into the ground.

276
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,400
It happened at least once.
The old mama-san...

277
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:01,500
...she was here one day
and gone the next.

278
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:05,300
- The guards were in a proper lather too.
- What happened?

279
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:07,200
Nobody knows.

280
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:12,200
We think a certain guard opened
the gate, and she just walks away.

281
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,400
Which guard was it?

282
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:18,600
Velie. We think Velie.

283
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:24,800
So someone bribed Velie? With what?

284
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:28,500
I heard it was $ 100 for the gate
and a car waiting.

285
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:31,500
Please. If they catch you escaping...

286
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:34,400
...they add 15 years to your sentence.

287
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:37,700
Mama-san could have been shot
in the street.

288
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,600
All this talk is a waste of time.

289
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:43,900
You should get in touch
with Yankee Hank.

290
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:46,600
- Who?
- Yankee Hank.

291
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:52,100
- He's a barrister. That's a stretch.
- Yankee Hank's a damn good lawyer.

292
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:57,400
If he's so good,
how come you never called him?

293
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:00,600
An impoverished soul like myself?

294
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,400
He like American folding money.

295
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:05,000
You're not lying.

296
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:09,600
Of course, if I had the dosh,
I'd try Velie first.

297
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:45,800
Dad!

298
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:48,900
I'm so sorry.

299
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,400
What?

300
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,100
I'm sorry I lied about Hawaii.

301
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,100
Honey, it's all right.

302
00:34:55,400 --> 00:35:00,100
We're gonna get you out of here.
Don't worry. Whatever it takes.

303
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:02,300
Tell everyone I didn't do it.

304
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:07,200
- What?
- We didn't do it!

305
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:10,600
They know that. Everybody
knows that, baby.

306
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:13,700
Everybody back home
misses you, sweetie.

307
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:18,700
- Why would you want to come here?
- I'm so sorry.

308
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:22,000
That's all right.
We'll find a way, okay?

309
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:25,400
Everything is gonna work out,
I promise.

310
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:27,300
It'll be okay.

311
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:31,000
I love you.

312
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:45,400
He's going to get us out.

313
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:49,200
- He said us?
- Yeah, he wants to see you.

314
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:01,200
You always thought
you were so smart.

315
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:05,000
I hope you're proud of yourself.

316
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,600
- Mr. Davis...
- You're a schemer.

317
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:12,200
You think I don't know you?
You are dead wrong.

318
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:15,900
Every word out of your mouth is a lie.

319
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,600
Six years old, paint on your hands,
on our couch.

320
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:22,700
"I didn't do it."

321
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:27,700
16 years old, the beer cans
in my car. "I didn't do it."

322
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:31,000
Let me hear you say it again.

323
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:33,400
Say it in here.

324
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:36,100
Come on, for old times' sake.

325
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:41,100
I didn't do it!

326
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:49,300
I'm so glad he's here.

327
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,100
He's being so great about it.

328
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:55,400
He really knows
how to grease the wheels.

329
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:58,000
He'll know what to do.

330
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:00,400
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

331
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:03,000
- Why aren't you excited?
- I am.

332
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:06,100
Did he tell you
he spoke to your dad?

333
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:08,200
Goddamn it!

334
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:09,400
You like?

335
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:11,000
Good fish heads.

336
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:15,500
No! It's a matter of days now.

337
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:50,100

I told the detective the truth.

338
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:55,900
I told him about Nick Parks and all
the events leading up to our arrest.

339
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,600
I signed a statement...

340
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:04,600
...assuming it was just a translation
of what I said.

341
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:09,500
But these aren't my words.
I never said any of that.

342
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:12,500
That's the truth.

343
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:42,300
- What happened?
- Don't worry, we'll appeal.

344
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:46,600
You can request a pardon.
He found you both guilty.

345
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,700
- For how long?
- Good news. It wasn't life.

346
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,300
You both got numbered sentences.

347
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,800
- For how long?
- 33 years.

348
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:59,900
- Daddy!
- Honey, I'll take care of everything.

349
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,800
Yes, we're all over it.

350
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:09,100
Listen, I gotta go.

351
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:12,700
Sorry about that. Couldn't be helped.

352
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:16,400
- I know how you must feel.
- Fellas, look...

353
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:19,600
I know what goes on around here.

354
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,100
They take drugs seriously.

355
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:24,800
- There's no doubt...
- Come on.

356
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:29,600
Nobody here really wants
to stop the drugs. They're all...

357
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:37,600
I don't care if Thailand drowns
in heroin. That's their business.

358
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:41,600
Your business is to help
American citizens.

359
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:45,300
She didn't do anything.

360
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:49,400
They're not gonna make
an example of my little girl...

361
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,800
...with some trumped-up charge.

362
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:54,400
You pull strings all the time.

363
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:58,400
You could pull them for my daughter.

364
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:03,700
The DEA will continue
our investigation.

365
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:08,900
If we find the alleged man
who lured your daughter into this...

366
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:12,500
...we'll certainly
introduce that in an appeal.

367
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:17,600
I know this is difficult for you.

368
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:21,500
But the best thing
you can do is go home.

369
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,000
Go back to your family.

370
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:29,900
Nothing will fall through the cracks.
We'll keep you informed.

371
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,400
That's a promise.

372
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,700

So here we are.

373
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,800
Just two more drug smugglers.

374
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:44,800
I don 't even know why
I'm making this tape.

375
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:08,700
How do you do?

376
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,700
I'm Henry Greene.

377
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,400
Hank Greene, actually.

378
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,600
- Who are you?
- Yankee Hank?

379
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:20,500
Yankee Hank, or Hank the Yank,
or whatever.

380
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:25,200
What can I do for you?
You want a cigarette?

381
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:29,700
- So you're like a lawyer?
- No, I am a lawyer.

382
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:34,100
Is this pro bono work that you do?

383
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:37,300
Pro bono? No.

384
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:40,900
So I listened to your narrative.

385
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:46,900
Forgive me if I'm blunt,
but there's nothing there.

386
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:52,000
You just claim you didn't know
about the smack. If you're lying...

387
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:56,700
...you're brainy and stupid.
If it's true, you're just stupid.

388
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:59,800
So I gotta ask a few questions.

389
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:04,300
Who was carrying
the luggage with the drugs?

390
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:06,200
I was.

391
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:12,100
You had a couple kilos of heroin.
You didn't notice the extra weight?

392
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:15,900
- I didn't. I just didn't.
- We were late.

393
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,600
Yeah, of course.

394
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:20,800
- Who packed the bag?
- I did.

395
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:27,500
Alice, what does your father do?

396
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,400
Works at Bekins.

397
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:33,400
- Does he run a branch office?
- He rents trucks.

398
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:36,200
And your mom?

399
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,300
She died when I was 7.

400
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:42,100
Sorry to hear that.
What happened?

401
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:44,200
Car accident.

402
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,900
- And your dad?
- Insurance.

403
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:51,900
And my mom sells real estate.
Part-time.

404
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:57,000
I'll call to see
if they'll contribute...

405
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:59,900
...to their daughters' liberation
fund.

406
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:03,100
- What are you gonna do?
- Get you out.

407
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:06,700
Start writing letters
to lawmakers back home.

408
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:11,300
Congressmen. The president.
If you know a priest.

409
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:14,500
You want me to write
to my congressman?

410
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,700
That's right. I'll be in touch, girls.

411
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:24,900
- He's totally sleazy.
- Don't say that.

412
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:27,900
Greene? You say you're Thai?

413
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:30,000

Well, I might as well be.

414
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:33,600
I'm American, but I know
their justice system.

415
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:36,700
- Now there's an oxymoron.
- Yeah.

416
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:41,900
My wife, Yon,
is also a practicing attorney...

417
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:43,700
...born in Bangkok.

418
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,800
We've helped a lot of families.
We could help your daughter.

419
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:51,300
What do you want out of this?

420
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:54,100
I'm just a broker.

421
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:58,300
We're looking for our usual retainer.

422
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:00,900
Which is...

423
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:02,700
...$ 15,000.

424
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:04,800
$ 15,000?

425
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:10,400
7500 to try to get a hearing
and 7500 if we do.

426
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:13,700
That's for both girls.

427
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,300
Wait, for both girls?

428
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:21,200
- Darlene needs her own trial.
- You don't want to do that.

429
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:26,000
The strongest point is
that Alice didn't sign a confession.

430
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:31,900
Separate them, and you're begging
for Darlene to be singled out.

431
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:37,900
Do you wanna take a day or two?

432
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:40,000
No. God, no.

433
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:42,800
I'll get the money.

434
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:46,000
I'll call Marano
and wire it to you.

435
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:49,300
Great. We'll be in touch.

436
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:13,000
Who got you these tickets?

437
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:16,300
Same guy who introduced me
to these babies.

438
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:19,400
Well, hello there. Thank you.

439
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:23,200
Our next Minister of Justice.

440
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:25,500
He's worked hard for it.

441
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:28,400
He's working his fingers to the bone.

442
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:35,300
I love that guy!
I love that guy, man!

443
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:36,700
This is great.

444
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
No problem.

445
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:42,700
So when do I get the file
on Davis and Marano?

446
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:48,500
Those girls have no chance
of getting out of there.

447
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:50,300
Who's Nick Parks?

448
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:51,900
Who?

449
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:55,000
Why couldn't you find him?

450
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:59,200
The cops say the girls made him up.

451
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:02,100
Even if he did plant the six kilos...

452
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:05,100
...you know he'd never confess.

453
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:06,700
- Six?
- Yeah.

454
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:09,400
The shit was in their backpacks.

455
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:15,100
As far as the Thais are concerned,
they're guilty. Guilty or not.

456
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:17,500
Take a pass on this one.

457
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:21,900
After you give me the file, Roy.

458
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:33,000
Why not find out
who bought the plane tickets?

459
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:37,900
You'd think that'd be the easiest way
to catch this guy.

460
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:40,300
If he exists.

461
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:43,500
He sure doesn't exist in this.

462
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:45,700
What do you believe?

463
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:49,200
I believe that, either way...

464
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:52,600
...we'll be able to afford a new car.

465
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,200
This is Jagkrit's trophy photo.

466
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:00,500
Look at that, they're so arrogant,
they don't try to finesse it.

467
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:04,100
All that narcotic
in that little backpack.

468
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:07,000
I don't think so.

469
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:17,400
- That's great.
- It's just a hearing for a retrial.

470
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:21,400
I also talked to
the lady who runs the hotel.

471
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:26,100
Either she's not involved
or she's the best liar I've met.

472
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:28,300
What about Nick?

473
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:31,400
Parks isn't the magic bullet.

474
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:35,400
Even if we do find him,
it's your word against his.

475
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:38,100
But we're still looking.

476
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:42,800
Darlene, I need a moment with Alice.

477
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:45,300
Sure.

478
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,100
Nick was staying at
the Queen Victoria?

479
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:02,200
My wife found a maid there...

480
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:07,400
...who said there was a young man
there who matched Parks' description.

481
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:09,600
So, good, right?

482
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:13,700
The maid remembered him with a girl.

483
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,900
But when showed this picture...

484
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:20,500
...guess who the maid picked out
as the girl he was with.

485
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:23,700
Me.

486
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:28,200
Okay, I was at Nick's hotel.

487
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:32,400
And he came on to me,
but I told him to forget it.

488
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:36,900
He never even mentioned drugs.
I swear it.

489
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:41,200
- Is there anything else I should know?
- No.

490
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:48,300
Do you have to tell Darlene?
That would be really weird.

491
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:53,200
- I see no reason to tell anyone.
- Thank you.

492
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:57,100
Now I have a favor to ask you.

493
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:59,800
I haven't gotten your father's check.

494
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:04,800
I need you to talk to him.

495
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:20,500
Hi, hello. Hi.

496
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:24,800
Alice?

497
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:27,700
My God...

498
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:29,500
Are you okay?

499
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:32,700
Where are you? You sound close.

500
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,400
I'm still here in Thailand.

501
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:42,600
I'm trying to get there.
I would have been there sooner...

502
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:47,600
It ain't about money,
but the doc says my diabetes...

503
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:51,500
I don't have much time.

504
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:54,700
I'm here with that lawyer,
Hank Greene.

505
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,500
He needs his money
for the hearing.

506
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:04,400
I know, I talked to Doug about it.

507
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:06,700
And I got your money.

508
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:12,100
Daddy.

509
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,200
Do you think I did it?

510
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:20,300
Oh, jeez, sweetie...

511
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:23,200
Do you think I did it, Daddy?

512
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:26,400
That don 't matter to me.

513
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:29,200
I don 't care about that.

514
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:32,100
Do you think I'd do that to Darlene?

515
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:34,500
Oh, jeez, Alice...

516
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:39,500
Don't beat yourself up about it.
Nobody's perfect.

517
00:50:43,100 --> 00:50:46,400
- I gotta go, Daddy. Bye.
- Wait.

518
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:02,700
- It'll be here tomorrow.
- Good.

519
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:06,300
Thanks.

520
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:20,100

Who are they?

521
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:21,900
Refugees.

522
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:27,600
They're being sent back to Burma.
We fight to keep them here.

523
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:34,000
I think you are lucky today.
You have a lenient judge.

524
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:37,400
- That's good.
- That's very good.

525
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:40,900
Here we go.

526
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:54,600
Our pro bono work is good
for the firm's image. Right, honey?

527
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:58,100
Right. Some firm, you and me.

528
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:06,100
- You're a closet do-gooder.
- Right, a closet saint. Watch me.

529
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:14,600
He wants the prosecutor
to bring in the backpack.

530
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:24,600
He says the backpack
was inadvertently destroyed.

531
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:45,200
Would you care to demonstrate
how six kilos...

532
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:48,300
...that's 13 pounds of powder...

533
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:51,000
...can fit in here?

534
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:53,400
He doesn't get it.

535
00:53:00,100 --> 00:53:04,600
This backpack is from the same
manufacturer as the girl's.

536
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,700
Identical in every way.

537
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:15,000
If prosecutor and police can lie
about the amount of drugs involved...

538
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:19,900
...how can this sacred court
trust anything else they say?

539
00:53:24,700 --> 00:53:30,000
The charges must be dismissed,
and these innocent, young girls...

540
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:33,300
...must be freed.

541
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:46,500
He is going to address
the judge privately.

542
00:53:58,900 --> 00:54:01,500
You room 414?

543
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:03,900
That man room 414.

544
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:17,900
They know you snuck into the hotel
and tried to get free drinks.

545
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:22,200
- So?
- It proves you stole and you lied.

546
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:25,900
This court will consider anything...

547
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:30,100
...that proves you are
of low character.

548
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:32,800
That's such bullshit.

549
00:54:33,100 --> 00:54:34,300
Alice.

550
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:54,200
We lost.

551
00:54:57,700 --> 00:55:01,100
This trial's a joke.
A shitty third-world joke.

552
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:06,000
We proved they're all corrupt,
and the judge didn't give a shit.

553
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:10,000
Our evidence disappears!
What a big surprise!

554
00:55:10,300 --> 00:55:11,700
Get in the van!

555
00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:23,200
This is your country now. It won't go
better if you start pissing on them.

556
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:26,000
You got paid.
What do you care?

557
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,100
I don't.

558
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:31,400
What?!
You have to keep working for us!

559
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:34,700
You're on your own now.

560
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:54,000
You think the president gives a shit?

561
00:55:55,300 --> 00:55:57,600
You're kidding me, right?

562
00:55:58,400 --> 00:55:59,600
What?

563
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:02,700
Do you think getting stoned
is a good idea?

564
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:06,700
It's an excellent idea,
a terrific idea.

565
00:56:07,100 --> 00:56:09,700
Otherwise, I'd possibly kill someone.

566
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:14,000
But every single thing we do in here...

567
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:18,200
We've got no more money.
Hank's not coming back.

568
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:22,600
Even if we did, he can't
do dick in this country.

569
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:26,400
Hank the wank.

570
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:44,400
- So we're done with Marano and Davis?
- Yeah.

571
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:54,600
Because if we weren't done,
I think I've got something.

572
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:08,400
These six women
were on the same flight.

573
00:58:08,900 --> 00:58:12,900
All eight tickets were bought
with the same stolen card.

574
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:17,300
He had other couriers on that flight.

575
00:58:18,700 --> 00:58:20,700
It wasn't in the file.

576
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:24,000
- Was it in the file?
- No.

577
00:58:29,300 --> 00:58:32,600
Who was the customs supervisor
on duty that night?

578
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:02,800
This woman, Beth Ann Gardener,
arrived in Hong Kong.

579
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:08,200
Her suitcase arrived too,
but she never claimed it.

580
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:11,900
- I wonder why?
- I have her address.

581
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:16,600
So which member of the firm
is going to Hong Kong?

582
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:58,000

Charlie, did you forget your key?

583
00:59:58,500 --> 01:00:00,500
Yeah.

584
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:04,000
- Beth Ann?
- No!

585
01:00:05,300 --> 01:00:09,300
I'm not cops, I'm not immigration
and I'm not embassy.

586
01:00:09,700 --> 01:00:14,700
I'm a private defense attorney
for some Americans in Thailand.

587
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:16,600
And?

588
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:22,400
I'd like to ask some questions.

589
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:26,600
Try to help my clients,
two young women like yourself...

590
01:00:26,900 --> 01:00:32,000
...who may have been victimized by the
same person you dealt with.

591
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:34,400
What's your name?

592
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:37,000
Henry Greene.

593
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:38,400
Hank.

594
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:42,600
Well, like I told
the gentleman from customs...

595
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:46,600
...it wasn't my bag.
I didn't try to bring anything in.

596
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:50,100
Somebody must have been trying
to mess me up.

597
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:53,600
All I know is the guy
bought my ticket to HK.

598
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:57,300
I didn't know it was
a stolen credit card.

599
01:00:57,900 --> 01:01:00,000
So go arrest him.

600
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:03,000
- Nick Parks?
- Whoever.

601
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:04,700
- Are we done?
- No.

602
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:08,800
I'll wait for Charlie
to bring your wake-up dose...

603
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:12,000
...and snitch you both off
to the Chinese.

604
01:01:12,300 --> 01:01:14,600
Or we can talk about Parks.

605
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:18,900
I don't know what you're
talking about, but...

606
01:01:19,900 --> 01:01:24,500
...I may have heard stories
about situations like this.

607
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:29,700
And how does it happen
in these situations?

608
01:01:30,100 --> 01:01:33,600
From what I understand,
he looks for suckers.

609
01:01:34,100 --> 01:01:36,500
He comes on all nice and open.

610
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:41,500
When you're with him...

611
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:47,400
...if there's 100 people
in the room, it doesn't matter.

612
01:01:47,900 --> 01:01:49,700
All he sees is you.

613
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:56,300
That's how this person
gets the girl to trust him.

614
01:01:57,600 --> 01:01:59,800
Yes. Then, he...

615
01:02:00,100 --> 01:02:02,600
He starts asking her things.

616
01:02:02,700 --> 01:02:07,400
"Wouldn't it be great
to live in Switzerland?"

617
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:10,200
"Get married in Paris?"

618
01:02:10,500 --> 01:02:14,500
By the time he pops
the real question...

619
01:02:14,900 --> 01:02:18,400
...it's like you don't want
to disappoint him.

620
01:02:21,300 --> 01:02:23,000
That's what I've heard.

621
01:02:23,900 --> 01:02:26,900
You'll never find him, he's too smart.

622
01:02:27,300 --> 01:02:29,200
Maybe. What's his name?

623
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:33,100
Nick something, you told me.
Now, please leave.

624
01:02:37,100 --> 01:02:38,500
His name.

625
01:02:48,700 --> 01:02:50,400
Hello, Darlene.

626
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:53,900
Great, you working for us again?

627
01:02:54,300 --> 01:02:56,100
I don't know, maybe.

628
01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:01,400
Does the name Skip Carn mean anything?

629
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:07,400
Look, I had a lousy flight
back from Hong Kong.

630
01:03:07,700 --> 01:03:12,200
I met another of Nick's or Skip's
or whoever's girlfriends.

631
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:16,600
- Be straight with me.
- What are you talking about?

632
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:21,500
You've been playing me all along.

633
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:26,600
I thought it was Alice, but the
come-on wouldn't work with her.

634
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
- But it worked with you, huh?
- No.

635
01:03:29,300 --> 01:03:33,200
You fit the mold, Darlene.
He's done it 100 times.

636
01:03:33,700 --> 01:03:36,700
- You're just 101.
- Look, you're wrong.

637
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:41,100
He wined you, he dined you,
he made love with you.

638
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:44,900
Then what? Asked you to
spend your life with him?

639
01:03:45,300 --> 01:03:47,400
No, he never asked me that.

640
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,800
He didn't mentioned
getting married in Paris?

641
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:56,300
- What you'd do with a million bucks?
- Well, yeah, he did ask me that.

642
01:03:57,500 --> 01:04:00,900
He asked me something
about that, but I never knew.

643
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:04,000
Who was it then? Was it Alice?

644
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:07,200
Alice was never even alone with him.

645
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:19,500
What do you want from me?

646
01:04:19,900 --> 01:04:21,700
You want me to say I knew?

647
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:25,900
I planned the entire thing.
I'm the mastermind.

648
01:04:26,300 --> 01:04:29,400
Does that make it easier
for you to walk away?

649
01:04:31,900 --> 01:04:37,000
I don't care what you or anybody
thinks. I know I didn't do it.

650
01:04:49,700 --> 01:04:53,000
Darlene? Darlene!

651
01:04:55,300 --> 01:04:56,700
- You.
- What?

652
01:04:57,100 --> 01:04:58,800
You did it, didn't you?

653
01:04:59,100 --> 01:05:02,200
- What?
- The questions. Nick's questions.

654
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:06,000
"What would you do if you were rich?"

655
01:05:06,300 --> 01:05:09,300
His little tests.
I flunked, so he asked you.

656
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:11,700
What are you talking about?

657
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,900
I wasn't groovy enough.

658
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:17,300
- It wasn't me. It had to be you.
- It wasn't me.

659
01:05:17,700 --> 01:05:19,600
Did you fuck him too?

660
01:05:19,900 --> 01:05:22,500
Of course you did. Why not?

661
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:27,400
And then you gave me a bracelet?
Was that a consolation prize?

662
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:32,600
What did he say?
"Oh, Darlene's a sweet girl, but..."

663
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:37,000
And you!
"Darlene's a really sweet girl...

664
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:39,500
...but she's no match for you."

665
01:05:39,800 --> 01:05:43,500
You've ruined my life.
Do you understand that?

666
01:07:00,300 --> 01:07:02,100
No more girlfriend?

667
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:06,900
Thai people is good friends.

668
01:07:07,900 --> 01:07:10,100
No secrets between Thai friends.

669
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:13,500
Not like Yankee girls.

670
01:07:39,300 --> 01:07:42,200
- Ferg!
- Jason! Mary!

671
01:07:42,500 --> 01:07:45,500
Hey, babe. You look great.

672
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:48,700
Don't lie to a lifer.

673
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:52,500
We heard you couldn't
have anything in here...

674
01:07:53,300 --> 01:07:55,200
...but we got you each a bra.

675
01:07:55,500 --> 01:07:58,000
A little push-up in the padding.

676
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:04,200
- Alice?
- Great.

677
01:08:05,100 --> 01:08:07,900
So you guys still
hanging out together?

678
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:11,600
No, we see Mary
at Christmas, spring break.

679
01:08:11,900 --> 01:08:15,600
You're at college?
Do you like it?

680
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:20,000
It's just State.
I have this moronic roommate.

681
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:23,400
I mean, the girl sleeps in her socks.

682
01:08:23,700 --> 01:08:25,700
It's different than high school.

683
01:08:26,100 --> 01:08:29,100
That's good. That's really good.

684
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:33,000
I saw your sister in the mall.
She's so big.

685
01:08:35,100 --> 01:08:37,600
You guys look so good.

686
01:08:37,700 --> 01:08:40,500

Attention! Visiting hours are over.

687
01:08:40,800 --> 01:08:43,300
All visitors must leave.

688
01:08:43,700 --> 01:08:45,200
Darlene!

689
01:08:45,700 --> 01:08:48,100
At least you're together.

690
01:08:48,400 --> 01:08:51,000
At least you have each other, right?

691
01:09:46,700 --> 01:09:50,800
Whatever she's on, I want some.

692
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:19,500
Darlene! Darlene!

693
01:10:42,900 --> 01:10:45,100
She stay in infirmary.

694
01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:49,300
They find cockroach.
It crawled in Darlene's ear.

695
01:10:49,700 --> 01:10:54,300
It caused infection.
The doctor pulled it out from ear.

696
01:11:34,600 --> 01:11:36,100
Can I make a wish?

697
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:42,000
Spirit house is not for wish.
Spirit house not joke.

698
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:52,100
Can I talk to the guard
who forgot to lock the gate?

699
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:55,500
- Help me.
- Do you want to die?

700
01:11:55,800 --> 01:11:58,500
Velie, I've got money.

701
01:13:20,900 --> 01:13:22,600
Leave me alone.

702
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:32,000
- Can I just talk to you?
- No.

703
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:38,400
The night I gave you the bracelet...

704
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:42,800
...I was with Nick that day.

705
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:46,900
And he kissed me.
We didn't do anything else.

706
01:13:47,200 --> 01:13:49,700
He tried, but I wouldn't let him.

707
01:13:52,300 --> 01:13:55,100
I should've told you he was a creep.

708
01:13:57,100 --> 01:14:00,100
What if we had
just gone to Hawaii?

709
01:14:00,500 --> 01:14:05,400
What if I let you buy those drinks?
What if I told you about Nick?

710
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:09,500
- There'd be no Hong Kong...
- And we wouldn't be here.

711
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:21,600
We won't be here much longer.
I set it up. We're getting out.

712
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,200
I need to go to the bathroom.

713
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:09,800
Where's the goddamn car?

714
01:18:35,800 --> 01:18:39,200
I couldn't sleep.
The coffee's fresh.

715
01:18:40,200 --> 01:18:44,700
"Customs was told Davis and Marano
carried narcotics...

716
01:18:45,100 --> 01:18:48,500
...by an anonymous informant's
phone call.

717
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:52,500
Identification of the caller
was unsuccessful."

718
01:18:54,100 --> 01:18:57,100
They tape those calls, don't they?

719
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:00,100
Do they?

720
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:03,300
I don't know.

721
01:19:12,700 --> 01:19:14,600
Bud, check this out.

722
01:19:16,100 --> 01:19:20,600
- Just had it installed.
- U.S. Tax dollars are hard at work.

723
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:25,700
- Hey, it's a living. Drink?
- I don't think so.

724
01:19:26,100 --> 01:19:27,100
What's up?

725
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:30,500
Have you got a line
on a Skip K. Carn?

726
01:19:31,900 --> 01:19:33,100
Why?

727
01:19:39,200 --> 01:19:42,800
See? The letters, just rearranged.

728
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:45,800
It's an anagram. What's it prove?

729
01:19:46,100 --> 01:19:50,500
- I think you know all about him.
- I do?

730
01:19:51,100 --> 01:19:55,700
This is a recording from the
anonymous informant who called customs.

731
01:19:56,100 --> 01:19:59,800
A young man
with a heavy Australian accent.

732
01:20:00,200 --> 01:20:03,300
- It's Skip Carn. I'm sure.
- Prove it.

733
01:20:03,700 --> 01:20:07,000
It could be anyone
with an Aussie accent.

734
01:20:07,300 --> 01:20:09,900
Those girls didn't stand a chance.

735
01:20:10,300 --> 01:20:13,100
This scumbag bought eight tickets.

736
01:20:13,400 --> 01:20:15,700
His real couriers sailed by.

737
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:19,900
But your girls were
still carrying the smack.

738
01:20:20,300 --> 01:20:25,300
Goddamn it, Roy!
They're gonna die in that shithole.

739
01:20:35,300 --> 01:20:39,800
All I know about Skip Carn
is he's a low-level hustler.

740
01:20:40,200 --> 01:20:43,800
A bottom-feeder with friends
in high places.

741
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:46,100
And that's it?

742
01:20:49,300 --> 01:20:50,700
One friend...

743
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:53,800
...in a really high place.

744
01:21:07,800 --> 01:21:10,300
So he had to give up two mules...

745
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:13,600
...to cover for six other mules
on the flight.

746
01:21:14,100 --> 01:21:18,700
Could you stop saying that word?
We're not mules.

747
01:21:19,300 --> 01:21:22,000
Yes. Nick Parks tipped off customs...

748
01:21:22,300 --> 01:21:24,400
...to create a diversion.

749
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:29,100
They were too busy with you
to search the six other couriers.

750
01:21:30,400 --> 01:21:33,600
It's insurance for
this kind of people.

751
01:21:34,700 --> 01:21:38,700
The cops and customs guys
get paid extra money...

752
01:21:39,200 --> 01:21:41,700
...when they make a dope bust?

753
01:21:42,900 --> 01:21:45,300
So we were like a walking bribe.

754
01:21:46,500 --> 01:21:47,400
Yes.

755
01:21:47,700 --> 01:21:51,900
Now they'll add 15 more years
for trying to escape.

756
01:22:02,200 --> 01:22:05,100
You have been busy, Mr. Greene.

757
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:09,200
- Please, sit down.
- Thank you.

758
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:14,600
Getting those two girls set free
has earned you a few shekels?

759
01:22:15,300 --> 01:22:17,000
A few.

760
01:22:17,500 --> 01:22:21,500
I believe I'm really the source
of your good fortune.

761
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:24,300
How's that, sir?

762
01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:28,000
I catch drug smugglers,
and you defend them.

763
01:22:28,300 --> 01:22:32,100
I feel I'm owed some sort of
tribute from you.

764
01:22:32,700 --> 01:22:35,300
It's a regular food chain.

765
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:38,600
Yes, that's exactly what it is.

766
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:43,000
I guess Skip Carn would know
a thing or two...

767
01:22:43,400 --> 01:22:45,900
...about paying tribute to you.

768
01:22:48,100 --> 01:22:50,700
I expect a little more from you.

769
01:22:50,900 --> 01:22:55,400
You're acting like...
What's that American expression?

770
01:22:55,800 --> 01:22:57,900
An ambulance chaser.

771
01:22:58,600 --> 01:23:03,600
I'm kind of a loose cannon.
Know that American expression?

772
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:07,200
I'd love to blow this
out of the water.

773
01:23:07,500 --> 01:23:12,300
You have a cozy relationship
with a known drug trafficker.

774
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:15,900
This is exactly the kind of thing...

775
01:23:16,200 --> 01:23:19,000
...Americans love watching on TV.

776
01:23:19,400 --> 01:23:24,200
Two American girls' lives ruined
by a sleazy smuggler...

777
01:23:24,600 --> 01:23:27,600
...and the greedy cop in his pocket.

778
01:23:28,100 --> 01:23:33,000
You'll have to get ready for
Larry King. You'll love him.

779
01:23:33,400 --> 01:23:37,600
Barbara Walters will probably
have pictures of you.

780
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:42,200
Barbara and the parents
will go into the bedroom:

781
01:23:42,600 --> 01:23:47,100
"This is Darlene's room,
exactly as she left it."

782
01:23:47,500 --> 01:23:51,200
- Teddy bears...
- Is there a point to this fantasy?

783
01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:55,200
Yes, sir, it's a simple point.

784
01:23:55,900 --> 01:23:57,700
I need your help.

785
01:24:07,900 --> 01:24:09,900
That's a good accent.

786
01:24:10,200 --> 01:24:14,300
My Spanish teacher always told me,
"Good ear, bad memory."

787
01:24:15,700 --> 01:24:19,500
- How's Darlene doing?
- She's better.

788
01:24:21,300 --> 01:24:25,700
- We'll just wait for her.
- Can I ask you something?

789
01:24:26,200 --> 01:24:29,600
Since there's no money left,
why are you here?

790
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:34,600
No matter how I look at it,
you don't deserve this.

791
01:24:36,700 --> 01:24:40,800
- Even if I did it?
- Yeah, but...

792
01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:45,200
You didn't do it.
We both know it.

793
01:24:58,900 --> 01:25:02,100
I wanted you to hear this
at the same time.

794
01:25:03,100 --> 01:25:05,100
You're gonna get to go home.

795
01:25:07,500 --> 01:25:11,400
- How?
- You'll have to sign a statement.

796
01:25:11,700 --> 01:25:14,400
Admit you're wrong. Forget Nick...

797
01:25:14,900 --> 01:25:17,700
- A statement?
- I can't do that.

798
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:21,900
This is the official,
face-saving confession.

799
01:25:22,300 --> 01:25:26,100
You corroborate the police
version of events.

800
01:25:26,500 --> 01:25:28,900
That's our part of the deal.

801
01:25:30,200 --> 01:25:33,400
Then the crown will pardon you.

802
01:25:33,800 --> 01:25:35,600
Then you get to go home.

803
01:26:26,300 --> 01:26:27,700
All right.

804
01:26:28,900 --> 01:26:30,400
It's okay.

805
01:27:34,700 --> 01:27:37,500
No pardon: Narcotic offender.

806
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:41,000
- What's the problem?
- No pardon.

807
01:27:41,300 --> 01:27:44,600
Your Minister of Justice has agreed.

808
01:27:44,900 --> 01:27:48,300
You tell him that we have
an agreement.

809
01:27:48,700 --> 01:27:53,300
I'm sorry.
They are narcotics smugglers.

810
01:27:53,700 --> 01:27:56,600
You son of a bitch, we have a deal.

811
01:27:56,900 --> 01:28:00,700
Yes, nicely done.
You really had me going.

812
01:28:01,100 --> 01:28:04,300
But now there is no more Skip Carn.

813
01:28:04,700 --> 01:28:07,600
No one will get to him, so no deal.

814
01:28:12,700 --> 01:28:13,900
Wait.

815
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:19,900
No, get them off me.

816
01:28:48,700 --> 01:28:50,800
You may speak English.

817
01:28:52,300 --> 01:28:56,800
My best friend is not a drug smuggler.
She is innocent.

818
01:28:57,600 --> 01:28:59,100
She's innocent.

819
01:28:59,400 --> 01:29:02,400
All she ever did wrong
was to trust me.

820
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:09,500
Here you believe one friend
knows what the other does.

821
01:29:09,900 --> 01:29:11,600
Maybe that's friendship...

822
01:29:11,900 --> 01:29:16,200
...but I'm American, and I was not
that kind of a friend.

823
01:29:16,600 --> 01:29:18,500
I know this.

824
01:29:20,800 --> 01:29:24,200
Because I did it.
Because I was foolish...

825
01:29:25,900 --> 01:29:29,900
...and jealous.
I was afraid she'd drift away.

826
01:29:30,300 --> 01:29:33,300
I was afraid I was gonna lose her.

827
01:29:34,900 --> 01:29:37,400
She never knew. It was all me.

828
01:29:37,700 --> 01:29:42,000
She spent all this time
in your prison for my mistakes.

829
01:29:43,400 --> 01:29:45,200
I'm sorry.

830
01:29:46,500 --> 01:29:50,700
Please, if you need someone
to do the time, I'll do it.

831
01:29:51,100 --> 01:29:55,300
I'll do her time and mine.
Just let her go, please.

832
01:30:07,100 --> 01:30:12,000
Then you're of strong character
and would lie to save your friend?

833
01:30:13,200 --> 01:30:16,000
No, I am of weak character.

834
01:30:16,500 --> 01:30:19,800
And I just want to
make up for my mistakes.

835
01:30:20,200 --> 01:30:23,300
If you're lying to
save your friend...

836
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:28,100
...then you're of sufficient character
to earn what you want.

837
01:30:29,300 --> 01:30:31,700
If you're telling the truth...

838
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:36,300
...then your friend is innocent
and should go free.

839
01:30:36,700 --> 01:30:40,800
If you are willing to serve
her term and yours...

840
01:30:41,300 --> 01:30:43,600
...your friend is pardoned.

841
01:30:49,500 --> 01:30:51,900
Thank you. Thank you.

842
01:31:26,800 --> 01:31:29,300
Darlene must go soon.

843
01:31:47,100 --> 01:31:49,300
You're a very good liar.

844
01:31:50,500 --> 01:31:52,300
You didn't do it.

845
01:31:53,700 --> 01:31:55,800
I know you didn't do it.

846
01:31:57,100 --> 01:31:59,100
I don't think I can leave you.

847
01:32:02,700 --> 01:32:05,100
If I say it was the truth...

848
01:32:05,700 --> 01:32:09,200
...you'll hate me.
And if I say I lied...

849
01:32:09,500 --> 01:32:14,600
...then when you go home,
all the time with your family...

850
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,800
You won't be able to just be happy.

851
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:23,400
So let's just say it was
the right thing to do.

852
01:32:28,500 --> 01:32:30,800
Let's just leave it at that.

853
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:43,200
Come, Darlene.

854
01:32:54,500 --> 01:32:57,900
- I'm going to get you out of here.
- I know.

855
01:33:01,800 --> 01:33:05,600
Go, Dar. I need you to.

856
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:08,800
Please.

857
01:34:44,100 --> 01:34:48,600
 A lot of people won 't
understand why I said I did it.

858
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:52,000
But for me, it was
the right thing to do.

859
01:34:52,900 --> 01:34:56,300
Maybe more right than
anything I ever did.

860
01:34:57,900 --> 01:35:01,100
Darlene and Hank won 't stop trying...

861
01:35:02,200 --> 01:35:04,100
...till I'm out of here.

862
01:35:05,400 --> 01:35:07,000
Until I'm free.
