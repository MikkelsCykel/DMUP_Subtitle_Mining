00:03:21,267 --> 00:03:24,134
I can hear your heart beating.

2
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:29,636
Sounds like a little animal
in your chest trying to get out.

3
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:34,740
Sounds like blood.

4
00:03:38,117 --> 00:03:40,085
Sounds like flesh.

5
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:49,361
No.

6
00:03:55,602 --> 00:03:58,298
Most of all, it sounds like love.

7
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,005
- What's this?
- Well...

8
00:04:02,475 --> 00:04:03,965
What is this?

9
00:04:04,177 --> 00:04:05,735
- It's my gun.
- Your gun?

10
00:04:11,017 --> 00:04:12,951
Don't hurt me.

11
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:18,582
Give me your hand, Culter.

12
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:24,419
- Get on your knees. Get up, Culter.
- I'm trying to.

13
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:29,162
<i>- Jess, I'm here.</i>
- I've got Culter.

14
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:31,929
Wilson, I need backup.
23 Ralston, the old Battery.

15
00:04:32,138 --> 00:04:34,265
<i>10-4. Backup units rolling.</i>
<i>I got your back, Jess.</i>

16
00:04:34,474 --> 00:04:36,408
- Get on your knees.
- I'm on my fucking knees.

17
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:40,067
- Get up.
- I'm up. I'm up.

18
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:43,372
<i>- Hold him there, Jessica.</i>
- Come on.

19
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,414
Come on.

20
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:48,052
Oh, yeah. One more thing.

21
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:02,632
- Hey, Shepard.
- What?

22
00:05:02,835 --> 00:05:04,427
Do that thing again.

23
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:12,438
<i>Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it!</i>

24
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:15,978
<i>Do it! Do it! Do it...</i>

25
00:05:16,182 --> 00:05:19,640
Inspector Shepard, Homicide.

26
00:05:24,557 --> 00:05:26,047
Yes.

27
00:05:26,726 --> 00:05:27,954
Who wants a beer?

28
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,095
- I do.
- I second that.

29
00:05:30,296 --> 00:05:32,127
- Another round, Peter.
- You got it.

30
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:34,800
- All right, big guys.
- Pass them down, boys.

31
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,764
Thanks for being
on the phone, Wilson.

32
00:05:36,969 --> 00:05:40,029
You and me?
You and me are like this.

33
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:42,106
You're drunk.

34
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:46,168
No, seriously, serious,
serious, serious.

35
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:49,314
Look, just because you're
moving up to Homicide,

36
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:51,346
don't take me off
your speed dial, OK?

37
00:05:51,718 --> 00:05:55,176
No, no, no. I mean,
any time you press that button,

38
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:58,789
any time you push that button,
I'll be there to pick up.

39
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:00,725
OK?

40
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,761
- I'm gonna miss you.
- Here's to you.

41
00:06:06,132 --> 00:06:07,997
OK. Don't forget about me.

42
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:09,532
Give me some.

43
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:14,468
I'll miss you too, Wilson.

44
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:19,441
Look, I'm telling you,
these Homicide guys, they're mental.

45
00:06:19,645 --> 00:06:22,045
And they get turned on
by fucking corpses, remember that.

46
00:06:22,248 --> 00:06:23,909
Now, that's interesting.

47
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:28,649
What the fuck is this,
the peanut gallery?

48
00:06:28,855 --> 00:06:30,846
Shot of rye, please.

49
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:35,585
I was just wondering, do you mean
they're turned on by fucking corpses,

50
00:06:35,862 --> 00:06:40,458
- or by fucking corpses?
- God.

51
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,497
- Mind your business.
- A lot of beers here.

52
00:06:42,702 --> 00:06:44,431
Let's spread them around.

53
00:06:45,705 --> 00:06:48,401
Another shot of Jack, please, Pete.

54
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,504
What?

55
00:06:55,715 --> 00:06:57,410
Oh, nothing.

56
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:01,250
Oh, I was just thinking
how awkward you look...

57
00:07:01,454 --> 00:07:03,581
...even though you are a cop.

58
00:07:03,956 --> 00:07:05,787
What precinct?

59
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,829
Have it your way, stranger.

60
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:16,964
- Congratulations, inspector.
- Hey.

61
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:20,298
Hey, sexy. Come on, let's dance.

62
00:07:20,506 --> 00:07:22,406
- You wanna dance?
- You gonna be cool, Jimmy?

63
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:24,974
What do you mean,
am I gonna be cool?

64
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:27,772
Like I'm here to fight with you
or something?

65
00:07:28,748 --> 00:07:29,976
Hey, he made it!

66
00:07:30,183 --> 00:07:31,411
- Hello, commissioner.
- Hi.

67
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:33,175
- How you doing?
- Hey, how you doing?

68
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:35,911
Back up, boys,
you're breathing my air.

69
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:37,783
- Hey, look who showed up.
- Good to see you.

70
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:40,117
- What's up, commissioner?
- Hey.

71
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:43,558
Leo, how you doing?

72
00:07:43,763 --> 00:07:45,458
If my mentor were
police commissioner,

73
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:49,624
I think I'd be getting a promotion too.
You know what I mean?

74
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:51,394
- Yeah, is that right?
- Yeah.

75
00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:52,866
I got ears like a cat, son.

76
00:07:53,072 --> 00:07:56,132
So let's see what we can do
about getting you that promotion.

77
00:07:56,609 --> 00:07:59,169
Test. There's a man sitting
at the end of the bar,

78
00:07:59,378 --> 00:08:01,369
looks like he's been sitting there
for a while.

79
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:04,516
I want you to describe him.
And I want details.

80
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:09,154
Well, you know what? I'm just here
to have a good time, man. That's it.

81
00:08:09,355 --> 00:08:11,823
Oh, so talking to me is not
your idea of a good time?

82
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:15,760
Or is it that you just can't do it?

83
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:18,697
- I could do it.
- OK, so go ahead,

84
00:08:18,898 --> 00:08:21,059
get yourself a promotion.

85
00:08:24,136 --> 00:08:25,831
Look at me.

86
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:28,902
He's a white guy.

87
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,204
And...

88
00:08:34,146 --> 00:08:37,707
He's got, I don't know,
a dark sports jacket. I don't know.

89
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:41,546
- You know what? I'm off duty, man.
- Yeah, I know.

90
00:08:43,656 --> 00:08:45,317
Shepard?

91
00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:49,819
Go.

92
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:55,462
White male, late 40s, 6 foot, 200
pounds, thinning gray hair, glasses.

93
00:08:55,668 --> 00:08:58,000
He's wearing two gold chains
with some sort of medallion.

94
00:08:58,638 --> 00:09:01,573
He's drinking shots and paying cash.

95
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:08,639
And that's why she's an inspector,
and you're not.

96
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:12,184
The good inspector's never off duty.

97
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:14,114
My office.

98
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:21,883
Inspector Shepard.

99
00:09:23,095 --> 00:09:25,620
Making an old man proud.

100
00:09:25,831 --> 00:09:27,059
So...

101
00:09:27,266 --> 00:09:30,030
- You pass the written?
- Yeah, of course. How could I not?

102
00:09:31,437 --> 00:09:35,203
- Trained by the master.
- Really, Grasshopper?

103
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:39,204
Well, the master is amazed
at how badly you almost fucked it up.

104
00:09:42,048 --> 00:09:43,276
- What?
- Well, a moment ago,

105
00:09:43,482 --> 00:09:45,950
you demonstrated you still know
how to process a room.

106
00:09:46,152 --> 00:09:48,245
So tell me this,

107
00:09:48,454 --> 00:09:51,389
how did that psycho get
a knife to your throat?

108
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:54,654
No. Let me tell you.

109
00:09:56,629 --> 00:10:00,725
You went there alone without backup.
And you didn't tell anybody.

110
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:03,629
You didn't follow procedure
and you almost got yourself killed.

111
00:10:03,836 --> 00:10:05,428
You know, you're lucky you're not
being brought up in front of

112
00:10:05,638 --> 00:10:07,731
a disciplinary committee
instead of being promoted.

113
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:10,605
You're right. I fucked up.

114
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:16,810
Listen, it was an honor for me
to raise you,

115
00:10:17,016 --> 00:10:19,382
to raise my partner's child.

116
00:10:28,694 --> 00:10:31,219
I'm just glad you made it through.

117
00:10:32,431 --> 00:10:34,331
But you're Homicide now.

118
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:37,263
There's no more room for mistakes.

119
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,062
Copy that?

120
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:42,330
Copy.

121
00:10:43,909 --> 00:10:45,536
Nice kick.

122
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:55,520
I mean, what kind of moron
tries to flush body parts down a toilet,

123
00:10:55,721 --> 00:10:59,179
especially when he's got
a perfectly good furnace out back?

124
00:11:01,527 --> 00:11:04,018
- I'm gonna head out.
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

125
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:06,357
Where you been hiding?
This is your night.

126
00:11:07,199 --> 00:11:11,568
Hey, the first female chief of police
of San Francisco right here.

127
00:11:11,771 --> 00:11:13,363
- Mark my words.
- Oh, yeah.

128
00:11:13,572 --> 00:11:15,164
- To the chief.
- To the chief.

129
00:11:15,374 --> 00:11:17,205
You remind me so much
of your father.

130
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,877
God, he would've been proud of you.

131
00:11:22,815 --> 00:11:24,476
All right. I want you to go
straight home

132
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:25,981
- and get some rest.
- I will.

133
00:11:46,772 --> 00:11:49,332
- Everything all right?
- Yeah. Everything's all right.

134
00:11:50,609 --> 00:11:52,634
Knob Creek, neat.

135
00:12:38,157 --> 00:12:40,057
Do you live around here?

136
00:12:57,977 --> 00:12:59,205
What?

137
00:14:56,695 --> 00:14:57,923
<i>Any nightmares?</i>

138
00:14:59,665 --> 00:15:01,428
Insomnia?

139
00:15:01,634 --> 00:15:04,125
Anxiety? Panic attacks?

140
00:15:04,336 --> 00:15:05,894
Nothing.

141
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:11,271
OK, here's the deal.
This session is mandated.

142
00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:13,069
It's standard procedure
for any cop

143
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,747
who's been through
a traumatic experience.

144
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:20,040
Plus, in this instance,
the suspect got a little roughed up.

145
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:21,844
Really?

146
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:26,721
Let's get something straight.
I do not have a dog in this fight.

147
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:30,384
I am not the enemy. Anything
you tell me goes right into the vault.

148
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,897
OK?

149
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:35,660
Unless I'm convinced a crime
is about to be committed

150
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:38,302
or you are a danger to yourself.

151
00:15:38,504 --> 00:15:41,302
Also, you being here does not
jeopardize your promotion.

152
00:15:42,374 --> 00:15:44,069
Good to know.

153
00:15:45,244 --> 00:15:46,939
Anything else?

154
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:55,443
You're hoping I have
some big problems.

155
00:15:55,654 --> 00:15:58,248
Frankly, I prefer to find people
in perfect mental health.

156
00:15:59,558 --> 00:16:02,527
Well, then say hello
to perfect mental health, doc.

157
00:16:02,728 --> 00:16:06,289
OK, then.
Hello, perfect mental health.

158
00:16:06,732 --> 00:16:08,893
So you did kick Culter?

159
00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:12,830
Hands break, feet don't.

160
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,834
You gotta get physical
every once in a while.

161
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:18,403
What's once in a while?

162
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:24,006
Yawara to the rib break.
Yawara to the groin.

163
00:16:24,216 --> 00:16:26,377
Remember your distracters.

164
00:16:26,585 --> 00:16:30,453
Yawara to the sternum.
Yawara to the clavicle.

165
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:34,592
Yawara to the rib break.
Yawara to the groin.

166
00:16:34,793 --> 00:16:37,660
Good. Let me see how
you're holding your Yawara stick.

167
00:16:37,863 --> 00:16:41,026
OK, put your thumb over here
a little bit.

168
00:16:41,233 --> 00:16:44,600
OK, perfect. Let's do it again.

169
00:16:45,604 --> 00:16:48,129
Yawara to the sternum.
Distracter.

170
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:52,299
Yawara to the clavicle.
Yawara to the rib break.

171
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:53,876
Yawara to the groin.

172
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:13,388
Hi. I'm looking for
Inspector Delmarco.

173
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,727
Delmarco!

174
00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:22,297
Where the hell is Delmarco?

175
00:17:25,911 --> 00:17:30,007
- Oh, you've got to be kidding me.
- Do I look like the kidding type?

176
00:17:31,917 --> 00:17:33,851
- Delmarco.
- Shepard.

177
00:17:35,154 --> 00:17:39,090
Follow me.
Boys, meet Inspector...

178
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:40,758
- Shepard.
- Shepard.

179
00:17:40,959 --> 00:17:44,986
- Flanagan. Dale Becker.
- Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you.

180
00:17:47,633 --> 00:17:50,101
Shepard, here's a tip for you.

181
00:17:50,302 --> 00:17:54,830
Stumbling on a suspect does not
an inspector make. Good luck, honey.

182
00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:57,175
Thanks so much.

183
00:18:01,013 --> 00:18:02,708
Dale was primary on the Culter thing.

184
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:07,079
Then you waltzed in with the suspect.
Congratulations.

185
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,520
You've made enemies already.

186
00:18:14,126 --> 00:18:17,527
This job is about the fucking work.

187
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:24,235
So how come you didn't say anything
in the bar last night?

188
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:25,869
I couldn't.
I was following someone.

189
00:18:26,071 --> 00:18:27,971
- Oh, yeah? Who?
- You.

190
00:18:28,173 --> 00:18:31,574
Ask her.
She knows what she did.

191
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:36,076
She picked me up
and she lured me to that place, sir.

192
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:38,272
And then she got rough.

193
00:18:38,484 --> 00:18:41,578
That's it. That's the simple truth of it,
Mr. Porter.

194
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:43,785
I had no idea she was a police officer.

195
00:18:43,989 --> 00:18:46,753
I mean, isn't that some form
of entrapment?

196
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:49,052
Then she handcuffs me,
I'm down on my knees.

197
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:52,856
She kicks me in the face,
knocks me out cold.

198
00:18:53,065 --> 00:18:57,263
Come on, isn't there some law
against police brutality, sir?

199
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:59,835
I'm going through a lot of pain
and suffering, Mr. Porter.

200
00:19:00,038 --> 00:19:02,029
Yeah. Well, I'm very sorry
about that, Edmund.

201
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:04,368
But now that I'm on the case,
we will be petitioning

202
00:19:04,576 --> 00:19:05,975
the judge to reconsider your bail.

203
00:19:06,245 --> 00:19:10,648
We will be pursuing
many, many other options. OK?

204
00:19:22,094 --> 00:19:23,994
I know your little dirty side.
I know you.

205
00:19:24,897 --> 00:19:26,592
You're me.

206
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:29,791
Come on.

207
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:35,499
Ray, please tell me you are not
gonna represent that loser.

208
00:19:35,974 --> 00:19:39,171
That loser's daddy
is Culter Pharmaceuticals.

209
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:42,006
I golf with him Tuesdays
at the Olympic Club.

210
00:19:42,214 --> 00:19:45,012
He's asked me, as a favor,
to defend his boy.

211
00:19:45,217 --> 00:19:46,946
I'm gonna do that.
Is that a problem?

212
00:19:47,152 --> 00:19:49,518
When you were assistant DA,
you used to love

213
00:19:49,721 --> 00:19:52,713
to nail bad guys' asses to the wall
like trophies.

214
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:56,156
Raymond Porter. I wonder whatever
happened to "crime doesn't pay"?

215
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:58,261
Gee, Delmarco, I don't know.

216
00:19:58,463 --> 00:20:00,829
Whatever happened to
"innocent until proven guilty"?

217
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:03,160
I mean, do cops
ever make mistakes?

218
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:05,893
How about you, Mike?
Ever make a mistake?

219
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:09,967
Yeah, you know
what I'm talking about.

220
00:20:13,011 --> 00:20:14,239
Would you excuse us?

221
00:20:14,446 --> 00:20:17,711
I need to speak with Jessica
for a minute. In private.

222
00:20:23,755 --> 00:20:25,586
OK, that guy, Delmarco,

223
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:28,325
tends to go off the deep end.
You be careful.

224
00:20:28,527 --> 00:20:31,462
Ray, you got a client
with a string of murders in his past.

225
00:20:31,663 --> 00:20:34,359
Wait a second, every defendant
has the right to his day in court.

226
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:36,261
That young man
has no prior convictions...

227
00:20:36,468 --> 00:20:38,026
Ray.

228
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:40,330
He's the guy.
I nabbed him in the act.

229
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:43,201
Well, sometimes nabbing the bad guy
is the easy part.

230
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:45,774
The hard part is learning how to relax.

231
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:49,604
Yeah. Maybe you know someone
who could help you with that?

232
00:20:51,783 --> 00:20:53,944
I think about that night.

233
00:20:54,786 --> 00:20:57,254
I think about it all the time.

234
00:20:59,057 --> 00:21:01,321
Always thought you'd come back...

235
00:21:02,628 --> 00:21:04,391
...but you never did.

236
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:08,664
This fucking skell
runs around grabbing up girls,

237
00:21:08,867 --> 00:21:11,995
sticking a knife into them,
murdering them.

238
00:21:12,204 --> 00:21:14,536
Hell, he deserved
a piece of your mind.

239
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:16,401
Yeah, Ray will say he was cuffed,

240
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:20,942
and that you violated his civil rights
and all that bullshit, blah-blah-blah.

241
00:21:21,146 --> 00:21:24,707
But the bottom line is,
it's your word against his.

242
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:26,247
He was resisting.
Remember that.

243
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:28,745
And that's your story
and you stick to it.

244
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:31,047
Don't get fancy, don't get creative.

245
00:21:31,256 --> 00:21:32,985
Just stick to your story,
you'll be fine.

246
00:21:35,861 --> 00:21:38,261
Hell, everything's fine.

247
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:40,397
And what's not fine can be fixed.

248
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,031
Right?

249
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:46,267
I guess Culter did impact my life.
He got me promoted.

250
00:21:48,206 --> 00:21:50,003
So?

251
00:21:50,876 --> 00:21:52,605
Do I pass?

252
00:21:53,779 --> 00:21:55,713
Well, almost.

253
00:21:55,914 --> 00:21:58,610
There's just one more thing
I'd like to talk about today.

254
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:00,341
Shoot. I'm an open book.

255
00:22:01,053 --> 00:22:02,645
I'd like to talk about your parents.

256
00:22:04,423 --> 00:22:07,324
My parents are dead.
They were killed in a car crash.

257
00:22:09,795 --> 00:22:12,195
OK. So...

258
00:22:12,764 --> 00:22:14,493
...now that's what you tell people.

259
00:22:19,404 --> 00:22:22,430
Thought this was supposed to be
related to my job.

260
00:22:25,377 --> 00:22:28,141
I don't see what my parents
have to do with my job.

261
00:22:29,448 --> 00:22:31,245
Well...

262
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:34,442
...25 years ago,
your father went on a killing spree

263
00:22:34,653 --> 00:22:36,416
which ended with your mother

264
00:22:36,621 --> 00:22:39,454
and his own suicide.

265
00:22:39,825 --> 00:22:42,919
And you've devoted your life
to tracking killers

266
00:22:43,128 --> 00:22:45,528
and you don't see how it relates?

267
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:50,225
You sure?

268
00:22:57,008 --> 00:22:58,999
I barely remember my parents.

269
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:01,975
I was raised by John Mills,
my father's old partner.

270
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:04,410
OK, but it<i>...</i>

271
00:23:05,951 --> 00:23:08,647
- It could be your anger problems...
- I don't have anger problems.

272
00:23:08,854 --> 00:23:10,913
I don't have any problems.
I feel fantastic.

273
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:12,755
Wow.

274
00:23:13,091 --> 00:23:14,718
Aren't you lucky.
What's your secret?

275
00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:20,262
<i>Jessica, listen to me.</i>

276
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,401
<i>My job is to help you</i>
<i>deal with your feelings.</i>

277
00:23:26,772 --> 00:23:29,400
<i>I deal with my feelings plenty.</i>

278
00:23:49,995 --> 00:23:51,223
Hello?

279
00:24:50,722 --> 00:24:52,883
I miss you, Mom.

280
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:29,124
- Shepard.
<i>- Shepard,</i>

281
00:25:29,327 --> 00:25:31,852
<i>- where've you been all day?</i>
- Mike?

282
00:25:32,063 --> 00:25:34,827
<i>Be outside. I'll pick you up</i>
<i>in 15 minutes.</i>

283
00:25:36,968 --> 00:25:40,460
<i>- We got a 187.</i>
- OK.

284
00:25:53,451 --> 00:25:54,884
- Jess.
- Hey.

285
00:25:55,086 --> 00:25:56,485
- How are you, Wilson?
- All right.

286
00:25:56,688 --> 00:25:59,657
Wilson, Delmarco. You remember
Wilson, my old patrol partner?

287
00:25:59,858 --> 00:26:02,088
- Hi.
- Hey.

288
00:26:03,194 --> 00:26:05,526
OK, here we go.

289
00:26:06,197 --> 00:26:07,858
Any signs of cause of death?

290
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:12,059
I don't know, man. But at first glance,
I'd say he was beaten to death.

291
00:26:13,805 --> 00:26:15,272
What's the score?

292
00:26:15,607 --> 00:26:17,575
We're up three, top of the fifth.

293
00:26:19,611 --> 00:26:21,602
Jesus Christ.

294
00:26:24,349 --> 00:26:26,078
Who'd you piss off?

295
00:26:26,284 --> 00:26:28,946
OK, what have we got here?
Let's take a look.

296
00:26:33,825 --> 00:26:35,588
Interesting.

297
00:26:37,395 --> 00:26:40,762
OK, inspector,
let's see what you got.

298
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,693
- I don't think it was done here.
- Right. Good.

299
00:26:44,336 --> 00:26:47,499
- So?
- We should check the tide charts.

300
00:26:48,173 --> 00:26:49,697
What's that?

301
00:26:49,908 --> 00:26:52,877
Hey, Lopez, my key still good?

302
00:26:53,078 --> 00:26:55,706
- Yeah, Mike. Anytime.
- Tomorrow.

303
00:26:56,014 --> 00:26:57,242
She'll be waiting.

304
00:26:58,416 --> 00:27:00,384
Marine unit, my old unit.

305
00:27:00,585 --> 00:27:02,951
Tomorrow, me and you,
we gonna go for a little boat ride.

306
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:07,285
Hey. Check it out.

307
00:27:09,828 --> 00:27:11,989
- Cigarette burn.
- Nice.

308
00:27:12,197 --> 00:27:14,825
- Perfectly centered. Looks fresh.
- Yeah, let's get a photo.

309
00:27:15,033 --> 00:27:18,127
Get me a photo here.
Close-up of the cigarette burn.

310
00:27:20,271 --> 00:27:22,000
- Nice and tight.
- OK.

311
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:24,941
One more. Good.

312
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:27,077
Thank you.

313
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:31,912
Looks like he's been hit
with a blunt instrument.

314
00:27:35,186 --> 00:27:39,282
Precise. Very professional.
Something like this.

315
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:51,460
<i>Now batting, first baseman,</i>
<i>J. T. Snow.</i>

316
00:27:51,803 --> 00:27:54,101
- OK, see you later.
- You all right?

317
00:27:54,305 --> 00:27:56,136
Don't sweat it,
you'll get used to it.

318
00:28:01,246 --> 00:28:04,215
It's not that. I think I know him.

319
00:28:06,418 --> 00:28:09,854
His name's Bob, he drinks gin.
Nothing more you can tell us?

320
00:28:10,055 --> 00:28:13,491
I told you, I don't really know the guy.
I met him once, about a month ago.

321
00:28:13,958 --> 00:28:15,550
But you said you were intimate?

322
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:22,861
I picked up a stranger in a bar
and had sex with him.

323
00:28:23,068 --> 00:28:24,797
You ever picked up a woman
in a bar, lieutenant?

324
00:28:25,136 --> 00:28:26,398
Yeah, in my fantasy life.

325
00:28:26,805 --> 00:28:28,102
All right, I'll give it
to Parker and Lewis then...

326
00:28:28,306 --> 00:28:29,830
- Hey.
- Wait a second. Hey.

327
00:28:30,442 --> 00:28:33,639
- What is she, a suspect?
- Come on, we got the call.

328
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,314
All right, it's yours.

329
00:28:41,453 --> 00:28:43,080
Okey-dokey.

330
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:45,720
We have got Bob Sherman.

331
00:28:45,924 --> 00:28:48,415
Confirmed death,
eight, nine hours prior to discovery.

332
00:28:48,626 --> 00:28:50,321
The weapon is a small blunt object,

333
00:28:50,528 --> 00:28:52,621
and the kill shot is a blow
to the right temple.

334
00:28:52,831 --> 00:28:55,595
Although this guy was definitely beaten
postmortem as well.

335
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:58,325
And trace evidence...

336
00:28:59,204 --> 00:29:02,230
<i>... nada.</i>
Look, there are no fibers, no hairs.

337
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,499
I tented this guy.
I even super-glued him up.

338
00:29:04,709 --> 00:29:06,574
I could not raise a single latent.

339
00:29:06,778 --> 00:29:08,006
Sorry.

340
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,941
Shepard?

341
00:29:14,886 --> 00:29:16,410
We'll talk later.

342
00:29:19,791 --> 00:29:21,418
- Hey, Mike.
- We'll find the current that carried

343
00:29:21,626 --> 00:29:25,426
this guy here. Last night was windy.
Flood tide was about five knots.

344
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:28,121
The body could've drifted a long way.

345
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,867
I bet they could tell us
what happened.

346
00:29:37,075 --> 00:29:39,270
They've seen all the bodies
floating on the tides.

347
00:29:39,477 --> 00:29:40,739
They've seen all the smugglers.

348
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:46,110
There's hundreds of different
dumpsites, hiding places.

349
00:29:46,317 --> 00:29:51,380
Heroin, cocaine,
illegal pharmaceuticals, party drugs.

350
00:29:51,589 --> 00:29:55,252
You name it. I've chased a lot of guys
right down in there.

351
00:29:55,827 --> 00:29:59,263
I know every nook and cranny,
every secret spot.

352
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:01,830
I'm like the sea lions.
They're my neighbors.

353
00:30:02,033 --> 00:30:05,161
- See that place in there?
- You live there?

354
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:07,429
You're one big surprise
after another, stranger.

355
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:11,302
- You up for a cappuccino?
- You up for finding out who done it?

356
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:15,002
OK, inspector, back to work.

357
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:18,007
So, what exactly are we looking for?

358
00:30:18,216 --> 00:30:22,243
Well, I assume you checked
the victim's cuffs last night, right?

359
00:30:24,522 --> 00:30:28,117
I also assume that you would've seen
there was sand inside those cuffs,

360
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:30,157
which tells us...

361
00:30:31,429 --> 00:30:33,624
Maybe he was dragged
along the beach.

362
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:35,561
Exactly.

363
00:30:41,072 --> 00:30:43,802
Let's go check out the beach
at Crissy Field.

364
00:30:58,122 --> 00:31:01,182
I don't think anything
would've happened here. Too risky.

365
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:04,358
Not if it were late at night.

366
00:31:13,671 --> 00:31:16,731
So anyway, the ex confessed
after we shook him a little.

367
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:20,340
Great. Delmarco, Shepard,
where are you guys on yours?

368
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:23,446
Crime scene is clean.
No weapons, no prints, no witnesses.

369
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:25,878
We're going out to known associates
and neighbors.

370
00:31:26,084 --> 00:31:28,575
All right. Anything else?

371
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:30,544
All right, let's break it up.

372
00:31:30,755 --> 00:31:32,382
Yeah, actually,

373
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:35,889
I'd like to put word out to be on the
lookout for similar victims coming in.

374
00:31:36,094 --> 00:31:38,085
Males, 20 to 30, severely beaten.

375
00:31:38,296 --> 00:31:39,524
Wait a second.

376
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:42,097
You got only one body
and already you're thinking serial?

377
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,598
I mean, what is this?
Spotlight withdrawal?

378
00:31:44,802 --> 00:31:47,066
Here's some advice I like to share
with new inspectors.

379
00:31:47,272 --> 00:31:50,366
It's sort of like Homicide AA.

380
00:31:50,775 --> 00:31:53,767
One body at a time. OK?

381
00:32:15,967 --> 00:32:17,195
Your boyfriend.

382
00:32:18,403 --> 00:32:19,893
He's not my boyfriend.

383
00:32:21,406 --> 00:32:23,704
He's an ex and he's the reason
I don't get friendly

384
00:32:23,908 --> 00:32:25,773
with my co-workers anymore.

385
00:32:26,744 --> 00:32:28,371
Well, that's good to know.

386
00:32:29,514 --> 00:32:32,574
- Let me talk to him.
- Thank you.

387
00:33:53,564 --> 00:33:54,895
Shepard.

388
00:33:55,099 --> 00:33:57,067
<i>- Jessica.</i>
- Yeah?

389
00:33:57,268 --> 00:34:00,431
<i>Bridge Patrol found another floater.</i>
<i>Someone pounded the shit out of him.</i>

390
00:34:00,638 --> 00:34:02,037
OK.

391
00:34:23,661 --> 00:34:26,323
How much did we drink last night?

392
00:34:27,031 --> 00:34:29,591
Well, maybe next time you should
go easy on the sangria.

393
00:34:29,801 --> 00:34:32,167
I must have gotten wasted.

394
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:34,728
I kind of blacked out.

395
00:34:36,207 --> 00:34:38,402
Too bad I wasn't there.

396
00:34:56,894 --> 00:35:00,193
Big inspector now, so you don't
call me back ever, right?

397
00:35:00,398 --> 00:35:02,195
I guess that's the reason.

398
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:04,792
You patrol guys wanna rustle
me up some breakfast?

399
00:35:05,002 --> 00:35:07,994
A little bacon, eggs, toast,
black coffee.

400
00:35:08,206 --> 00:35:09,639
Seeing as how you're not busy.

401
00:35:09,841 --> 00:35:11,672
Fuck you, Delmarco.

402
00:35:11,876 --> 00:35:13,844
Make that bacon crisp.

403
00:35:42,006 --> 00:35:43,564
Check it out.

404
00:35:47,011 --> 00:35:48,945
Yeah. There's the cigarette burn.

405
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:51,775
- It's our guy.
- OK. Let's get him out.

406
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:54,281
- Keep it level!
- OK.

407
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,585
Good, a little more.

408
00:35:58,122 --> 00:36:00,113
- How's that?
- Right there.

409
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:01,791
All right.

410
00:36:24,982 --> 00:36:27,951
We got him. The guy was
in the system. Lawrence Geber.

411
00:36:28,152 --> 00:36:31,918
DOB 12-11-68.
Had a DUI a while back.

412
00:36:33,257 --> 00:36:35,487
- See you later, man.
- OK, bye.

413
00:36:37,628 --> 00:36:39,095
Tell me about it.

414
00:36:39,297 --> 00:36:40,730
How did you know
there'd be another body?

415
00:36:40,932 --> 00:36:43,196
There was that cigarette burn
on the back of the hand.

416
00:36:43,634 --> 00:36:46,762
It's not a simple homicide.
Cigarette burn's intentional.

417
00:36:46,971 --> 00:36:48,461
A signature.

418
00:36:48,673 --> 00:36:50,197
What's up?

419
00:36:51,275 --> 00:36:53,300
I can't say I'm happy
you were right about this,

420
00:36:53,511 --> 00:36:55,570
but it was a good call, Shepard.
Nice going.

421
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:57,213
All right, let's get on this fast.

422
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:01,776
I want this guy stopped
before the bodies pile up.

423
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:13,420
This guy thinks he's a pro.

424
00:37:13,631 --> 00:37:17,032
This guy thinks he's being careful
by covering his tracks.

425
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:19,100
Not with me, baby.

426
00:37:19,303 --> 00:37:22,397
Everybody leaves something behind.

427
00:37:28,879 --> 00:37:31,905
All I need is one little
speck of blood.

428
00:37:32,483 --> 00:37:35,077
Just one little...

429
00:37:36,887 --> 00:37:38,149
...drop.

430
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:41,458
Oh, yeah. Oh...

431
00:37:45,162 --> 00:37:47,323
Like this little drop, for example.

432
00:37:47,531 --> 00:37:49,658
You see the blood spatter
on the front of his body.

433
00:37:49,867 --> 00:37:52,335
That matches the angle of the blows.

434
00:37:52,536 --> 00:37:56,233
So, what's this little drop of blood
doing all the way back here

435
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,271
- behind his ear?
- Could be the killer's.

436
00:37:58,476 --> 00:38:00,034
How soon will you know?

437
00:38:00,244 --> 00:38:03,441
Well, I've got to extract it for DNA,
I've gotta amp it,

438
00:38:03,648 --> 00:38:04,945
I gotta type it.

439
00:38:05,149 --> 00:38:08,346
That'll tell us with absolute certainty
whether or not that drop

440
00:38:08,552 --> 00:38:10,713
matches the victim's blood.

441
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:16,286
And, if I may say it, you are looking
a little rough around the edges.

442
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:22,022
I've been a little stressed.

443
00:38:22,233 --> 00:38:23,996
You have been.

444
00:38:24,201 --> 00:38:28,365
At one point, you did suffer from
some stress-related symptoms.

445
00:38:28,572 --> 00:38:31,336
From when I was 6?
Is that what you've got there?

446
00:38:32,777 --> 00:38:36,975
My parents had died and I was sad.
I didn't know how to handle it.

447
00:38:37,181 --> 00:38:41,242
And what we have been discussing,

448
00:38:41,452 --> 00:38:44,353
your parents, your childhood,
that all could be stirring up a lot.

449
00:38:44,555 --> 00:38:45,783
Dr. Frank.

450
00:38:47,258 --> 00:38:51,592
I am working on my first case.
Looks like it could be a big one.

451
00:38:52,863 --> 00:38:55,297
Turns out I've slept
with both the victims.

452
00:38:57,401 --> 00:39:00,199
That's why I brought it up. You know,
for someone who's supposed to

453
00:39:00,404 --> 00:39:02,634
understand people,
you're a little slow on the uptake.

454
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:05,434
Jessica, listen to me.
You have to tell your partner about this

455
00:39:05,643 --> 00:39:07,975
or your lieutenant,
or someone in the department.

456
00:39:08,746 --> 00:39:11,078
And what if it isn't a coincidence?

457
00:39:12,383 --> 00:39:14,146
<i>What if you're in danger?</i>

458
00:39:36,507 --> 00:39:38,168
Fucking phone.

459
00:39:41,746 --> 00:39:44,078
Shoo! Go away! Go away!

460
00:39:49,687 --> 00:39:51,211
Goddamn it.

461
00:40:12,543 --> 00:40:14,067
Easy does it, Jessica.

462
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:21,847
- You all right?
- Yeah...

463
00:40:23,287 --> 00:40:25,551
...just a few rats under the car.

464
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:28,452
Rats. Yes, well, we live near water.

465
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:35,963
- See you next session.
- Yeah, we'll see you.

466
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:11,093
I just can't believe...

467
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:14,768
...that there was no warning.

468
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:17,334
That he just went...

469
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:19,567
...off like that.

470
00:41:24,081 --> 00:41:27,915
Your father loved
your mother very much.

471
00:41:29,553 --> 00:41:31,885
So much, in fact,
that it twisted him.

472
00:41:32,089 --> 00:41:33,488
You know what I mean?

473
00:41:33,691 --> 00:41:36,990
You know, sometimes I wonder if
maybe I hadn't told him about her.

474
00:41:37,194 --> 00:41:39,628
About her affairs. Look,

475
00:41:40,231 --> 00:41:44,463
you need to focus on your case.
Do your job.

476
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:47,228
That's the most important
thing right now.

477
00:41:49,907 --> 00:41:51,397
Hey.

478
00:41:54,445 --> 00:41:55,673
<i>OK, here's the deal.</i>

479
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,905
You all know about
serial killers taking trophies,

480
00:41:58,115 --> 00:42:00,481
a behavior which often
gets them caught.

481
00:42:00,684 --> 00:42:02,675
Well, in the past,
there have been killers

482
00:42:02,887 --> 00:42:04,149
who tried to smarten up,

483
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:07,085
didn't take trophies. Instead...

484
00:42:07,291 --> 00:42:09,885
...they "signed" the bodies.

485
00:42:10,094 --> 00:42:12,528
It's been done
in different ways: Cuts...

486
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:14,220
...brands...

487
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:17,997
...burns.
But signing the bodies

488
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:20,363
might not be that smart after all.

489
00:42:20,571 --> 00:42:23,267
Because the signature itself...

490
00:42:23,908 --> 00:42:25,967
...can be your best clue.

491
00:42:38,689 --> 00:42:40,020
So cigarette burns.

492
00:42:41,959 --> 00:42:44,826
We gotta think we're looking at
a smoker and the overkill...

493
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:49,957
The overkill suggests some rage.
Any questions?

494
00:42:50,167 --> 00:42:52,795
Oh, me! Me!

495
00:42:53,003 --> 00:42:54,470
Me.

496
00:42:55,372 --> 00:42:57,602
I was wondering,
have we eliminated

497
00:42:57,808 --> 00:42:59,275
Inspector Shepard as a suspect?

498
00:42:59,476 --> 00:43:02,377
- That's very funny, Dale.
- No, Mike, I'm serious.

499
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:04,980
I mean, we know she slept
with victim number one, right?

500
00:43:05,182 --> 00:43:06,410
- Sure.
- Yeah.

501
00:43:06,617 --> 00:43:09,279
So do we know if she slept
with victim number two?

502
00:43:09,486 --> 00:43:14,219
I mean, shit, Shepard,
he is kind of cute.

503
00:43:21,699 --> 00:43:23,496
- Motherfucker!
- Get off me! Come on!

504
00:43:23,701 --> 00:43:25,066
- Cunt!
- Take her outside, Mike.

505
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:27,794
- I'm cool. I'm cool.
- Dale! In my office!

506
00:43:29,039 --> 00:43:30,666
Back off.

507
00:43:30,874 --> 00:43:32,739
Bad joke. You made your point.
Now let it go.

508
00:43:32,943 --> 00:43:36,936
Yeah, it is a bad joke.
You wanna know the punch line?

509
00:43:37,147 --> 00:43:39,877
I did sleep with
victim number two.

510
00:43:43,854 --> 00:43:45,082
Why the hell did you do
something like that?

511
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:47,120
Listen, brother, it is none of your
business who I sleep with.

512
00:43:47,324 --> 00:43:49,155
Hey! Who the fuck cares
who you sleep with?

513
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:51,658
I'm talking about you
lying to me!

514
00:43:51,862 --> 00:43:53,921
OK? Because partners
tell each other the truth!

515
00:43:54,131 --> 00:43:56,622
Well, I'm telling you now!

516
00:44:04,608 --> 00:44:07,168
She says she met
these guys in a bar.

517
00:44:07,378 --> 00:44:09,471
Our killer's probably trolling
the same places,

518
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:11,910
and he was probably stalking her.

519
00:44:12,116 --> 00:44:13,845
Just to consider all options,
any enemies?

520
00:44:14,051 --> 00:44:17,714
Anyone got, like, a sick fixation on you,
might be stalking you?

521
00:44:18,789 --> 00:44:20,882
Lately, I've...

522
00:44:21,358 --> 00:44:24,225
<i>...</i>sort of felt like I'm being watched.
- So how do we handle it?

523
00:44:24,428 --> 00:44:26,623
- Do we pull her off the case?
- No.

524
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:29,958
You need to operate as though
this is not a coincidence.

525
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:32,158
That's the smart thing to do.

526
00:44:32,369 --> 00:44:34,462
From that angle, we pull her,

527
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:37,300
it might tip the killer
and we blow a good lead.

528
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:39,305
And if she is connected,

529
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:42,070
we're gonna need her help
to find out how.

530
00:44:42,279 --> 00:44:44,338
- That's gonna put her at risk.
- She's a cop.

531
00:44:44,615 --> 00:44:47,641
- She knows the risks.
- OK.

532
00:44:50,454 --> 00:44:51,682
Hey.

533
00:44:52,456 --> 00:44:55,357
Thanks a lot for
backing me up in there.

534
00:44:55,559 --> 00:44:57,322
Backing you up?

535
00:44:57,528 --> 00:44:59,894
I was just giving
my professional opinion.

536
00:45:00,097 --> 00:45:01,997
You want my personal opinion?

537
00:45:02,633 --> 00:45:04,965
Just what the hell do you
think you're doing?

538
00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:07,632
- I'm not doing anything.
- Yeah?

539
00:45:07,838 --> 00:45:10,329
Well, that's not what I hear.

540
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:12,975
These men you've been seeing.

541
00:45:13,177 --> 00:45:15,168
And today, you attacked
a fellow inspector.

542
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:17,176
Oh, it was a...

543
00:45:18,449 --> 00:45:20,349
...a disagreement.

544
00:45:21,085 --> 00:45:23,349
And what's going on with you
and this Delmarco genius?

545
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:25,488
For God's sake, John.
He's my partner!

546
00:45:25,689 --> 00:45:28,453
OK. Look, I know it's a new century

547
00:45:28,659 --> 00:45:32,254
and people think it's OK
to just have sex with whoever.

548
00:45:32,463 --> 00:45:35,227
But let me give you some advice.
Don't shit where you eat.

549
00:45:35,432 --> 00:45:37,525
Keep your social life
separate from the job.

550
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:41,068
I do. John, I know
you worry about me

551
00:45:41,271 --> 00:45:44,502
and I love you for it,
but I can take care of myself.

552
00:45:44,708 --> 00:45:48,041
Really? Is that why people
keep dying around you?

553
00:45:49,446 --> 00:45:51,175
Nice. Nice.

554
00:46:05,028 --> 00:46:07,223
May I have your attention, please.

555
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:08,728
S.F.P.D.

556
00:46:12,636 --> 00:46:14,069
Did I say that out loud?

557
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:17,399
Hey, I know you.
You come in here all the time.

558
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:19,132
You're a cop?
I don't believe it.

559
00:46:19,343 --> 00:46:21,368
- Believe it.
- I did think you were kind of hot

560
00:46:21,578 --> 00:46:23,671
for a working girl,
but I couldn't figure out

561
00:46:23,881 --> 00:46:25,815
why else you'd keep taking off
with those guys.

562
00:46:26,016 --> 00:46:28,883
Get it straight. We are not here
to discuss your opinion of me.

563
00:46:29,086 --> 00:46:31,748
We are here to discuss a guy
who used to look like this,

564
00:46:31,955 --> 00:46:34,423
and now looks like this.

565
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:37,617
So I know for a fact
he spent time in here.

566
00:46:37,828 --> 00:46:39,056
Who'd you see him with?

567
00:46:39,263 --> 00:46:41,356
Look, the only person I've ever seen
that guy leave the bar with,

568
00:46:41,598 --> 00:46:43,657
aside from his girlfriend,
was you.

569
00:47:06,523 --> 00:47:08,616
The bastard was always late
with the rent.

570
00:47:08,826 --> 00:47:10,919
Played drums at night.

571
00:47:11,128 --> 00:47:13,062
Serves him right.
Know what I mean?

572
00:47:13,263 --> 00:47:15,458
Did Mr. Geber have many
regular visitors?

573
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:18,760
The last person I saw him with
looked a lot like you.

574
00:47:18,969 --> 00:47:21,597
Seemed like he'd fuck
any skank that came on to him.

575
00:47:26,310 --> 00:47:27,709
You find out anything up there?

576
00:47:28,212 --> 00:47:30,840
We just wasted the entire day
tracking down me.

577
00:47:31,949 --> 00:47:34,645
Good. At least we
have a suspect.

578
00:47:34,985 --> 00:47:37,579
- It's a joke.
- Fuck you, Mike.

579
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:20,757
How did you get in my place?

580
00:48:22,432 --> 00:48:26,061
Now, is that any kind of welcome
for a man who's seen you naked?

581
00:48:27,471 --> 00:48:29,405
- What do you want?
- I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

582
00:48:29,606 --> 00:48:32,973
I mean, I just... I just wanna...
I wanna see you.

583
00:48:33,644 --> 00:48:35,373
- Come on, Jimmy, it's over.
- I... I do.

584
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:39,140
Don't you miss me just a little?
I miss you.

585
00:48:39,349 --> 00:48:40,680
What do you want?

586
00:48:40,884 --> 00:48:43,853
How many times do we have to
go over it? You know, it just...

587
00:48:44,054 --> 00:48:47,023
God, Jimmy!
Come on, knock it off!

588
00:48:47,224 --> 00:48:50,125
- No, no, no. Let me touch you.
- Jimmy!

589
00:48:50,327 --> 00:48:52,795
- Just let me touch you.
- Jimmy, knock it off!

590
00:48:52,996 --> 00:48:55,464
Just, please... Fuck.

591
00:48:56,233 --> 00:48:58,224
- Jimmy!
- I need you...

592
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:06,402
Holy fuck.
Oh, my God!

593
00:49:07,577 --> 00:49:09,238
- Jimmy, man, I'm sorry.
- Get off of me!

594
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:11,971
- Get off! Holy shit!
- Hey.

595
00:49:13,183 --> 00:49:15,276
- Hey, here.
- Get away from me!

596
00:49:15,485 --> 00:49:17,715
Goddamn it!
Get away from me!

597
00:49:17,921 --> 00:49:19,786
Oh, my God. You know what?

598
00:49:19,990 --> 00:49:22,458
You're a goddamn psychopath!
You know that?

599
00:49:22,659 --> 00:49:25,992
You've got a screw loose, man!
Wacko!

600
00:49:26,930 --> 00:49:29,922
Bitch! Holy shit!

601
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:33,467
- I'll be seeing you!
- Jim...

602
00:49:36,273 --> 00:49:39,174
When did you first find out?

603
00:49:40,110 --> 00:49:42,203
When did you realize...

604
00:49:43,313 --> 00:49:47,044
When did you realize that
you had the capacity to kill?

605
00:49:48,251 --> 00:49:49,741
To take a human life?

606
00:49:51,021 --> 00:49:53,455
You know, we all have it in us.

607
00:49:53,957 --> 00:49:56,653
You. Me.

608
00:49:57,694 --> 00:50:00,390
It's a matter of who can control it.

609
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:03,626
Can you?

610
00:50:08,205 --> 00:50:12,471
Jessica? What the hell are you
doing here with my client?

611
00:50:12,676 --> 00:50:14,974
A little police work.
Following through on some hunches.

612
00:50:15,178 --> 00:50:18,614
Oh, some hunches? I wanna
be here when you talk with him, OK?

613
00:50:18,815 --> 00:50:21,147
Every fucking time!
You got that?

614
00:50:21,351 --> 00:50:24,548
You don't have to have a hissy fit, Ray.
I'm cool with that.

615
00:50:25,355 --> 00:50:27,880
Edmund, do you remember
what I told you?

616
00:50:28,091 --> 00:50:30,855
OK? Only in my presence.

617
00:50:31,061 --> 00:50:33,222
Jesus fucking...

618
00:50:33,430 --> 00:50:35,898
I am not having a hissy fit, OK?

619
00:50:36,099 --> 00:50:38,693
I am protecting my client's
interests here.

620
00:50:38,902 --> 00:50:42,497
And you, you have got
a real battle on your hands here.

621
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:44,264
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah. I'm coming at you

622
00:50:44,508 --> 00:50:47,875
- with both guns blazing.
- At me? What did I do?

623
00:50:48,078 --> 00:50:53,038
Oh, yeah. Let's just say the law
works in mysterious ways, OK?

624
00:50:53,250 --> 00:50:54,877
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

625
00:50:55,085 --> 00:50:57,986
Well, I will explain it
to you in detail.

626
00:50:58,188 --> 00:51:01,123
But this is not the time
nor the place.

627
00:51:01,491 --> 00:51:03,857
Let's say you come over
to my house Sunday morning

628
00:51:04,061 --> 00:51:05,824
and we will talk about it.

629
00:51:06,696 --> 00:51:07,924
You know.

630
00:51:08,131 --> 00:51:09,689
Like old times.

631
00:51:11,935 --> 00:51:14,699
God, I love that perfume.

632
00:51:15,939 --> 00:51:17,736
See you.

633
00:51:22,212 --> 00:51:23,440
Thank you.

634
00:51:24,815 --> 00:51:28,683
- Sometimes I could kill that guy.
<i>...</i>the arresting fucking officer...

635
00:51:30,954 --> 00:51:33,923
...without me present!
You got that? Never!

636
00:51:34,157 --> 00:51:37,024
OK, OK. Don't have a hissy fit,
Mr. Porter.

637
00:51:40,764 --> 00:51:44,461
The good news is,
I was right, as usual.

638
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:48,795
That tiny little drop of blood,
no way did it match the victim.

639
00:51:49,005 --> 00:51:50,336
So we have our killer's blood?

640
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:53,941
Well, the bad news is,
he wasn't in the system.

641
00:51:54,144 --> 00:51:57,307
CODIS, the convicted felon database,
it gave me zip.

642
00:51:57,514 --> 00:52:01,575
So all you gotta do is bring me the
guy's blood that matches my sample.

643
00:52:01,785 --> 00:52:03,116
That's all, huh?

644
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:05,982
Hey, that's why they pay you
Homicide guys the big bucks.

645
00:52:06,189 --> 00:52:08,020
Surely, you have some leads.

646
00:52:08,225 --> 00:52:11,217
Bring your good pal Lisa
a little blood sample, will you?

647
00:52:11,428 --> 00:52:14,522
And I, one of law and order's
little people,

648
00:52:14,731 --> 00:52:17,325
will burn the midnight oil,
doing the task,

649
00:52:17,534 --> 00:52:21,061
making the match
that will lock that fucker up.

650
00:52:21,271 --> 00:52:24,934
And you get all the glory,
and what, do you ask, do I get?

651
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:27,610
Hey, perhaps a dinner
at Chez Panisse.

652
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:29,438
Downstairs, I would hope.

653
00:52:33,550 --> 00:52:34,812
Working late?

654
00:52:35,018 --> 00:52:37,452
Still going over all those
unanswered questions?

655
00:52:37,654 --> 00:52:39,246
The biggest question
of all still being,

656
00:52:39,456 --> 00:52:42,084
why is someone who would normally
be considered a prime suspect

657
00:52:42,292 --> 00:52:44,817
being allowed to participate
in this investigation?

658
00:52:45,028 --> 00:52:48,327
You got something to say to me,
Becker, quit being such a pussy

659
00:52:48,532 --> 00:52:50,363
and come out and say it.

660
00:52:50,567 --> 00:52:52,967
I'll say it, all right.
And I'm not gonna hold back

661
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:55,536
because you're well-connected
to someone protecting you.

662
00:52:55,739 --> 00:52:58,333
I'm not gonna let you drag
this department through the mud.

663
00:52:58,542 --> 00:53:00,976
Are you listening to me?
I know about you.

664
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:02,611
I know about you and Bob,

665
00:53:02,812 --> 00:53:05,280
and I also know about you and Larry.

666
00:53:05,482 --> 00:53:07,450
Let me ask you...

667
00:53:07,817 --> 00:53:11,617
...while you were sleeping with them,
were you thinking about hitting them?

668
00:53:12,455 --> 00:53:15,481
Are you thinking about
hitting me right now?

669
00:53:15,692 --> 00:53:18,786
Go ahead. You know you want to.

670
00:53:18,995 --> 00:53:20,553
You know, I don't know
about this case,

671
00:53:20,764 --> 00:53:22,755
but I do know one thing for sure.

672
00:53:22,966 --> 00:53:26,333
Every bone in your body
wants to hit me right now.

673
00:53:28,004 --> 00:53:29,562
Am I right?

674
00:53:44,287 --> 00:53:46,187
- Yeah, who is it?
- It's Jess.

675
00:53:46,389 --> 00:53:49,187
Hey, come in. It's open.

676
00:53:50,961 --> 00:53:52,724
How could you?

677
00:53:52,929 --> 00:53:54,624
- How could you do that to me?
- What's the matter with you?

678
00:53:54,831 --> 00:53:56,856
How could you tell Dale
about the victims and me?

679
00:53:57,067 --> 00:53:58,796
- What?
- I was just starting to trust you.

680
00:53:59,002 --> 00:54:01,436
Hey, listen to me!
You think I'd betray our loyalty?

681
00:54:02,839 --> 00:54:05,239
I would never do
something like that!

682
00:54:05,442 --> 00:54:07,205
What's the matter with you?

683
00:54:11,648 --> 00:54:13,707
What do I have to do...

684
00:54:14,751 --> 00:54:16,776
...to show you that
you're my partner?

685
00:54:18,221 --> 00:54:19,779
I'm sorry.

686
00:54:25,495 --> 00:54:28,293
Where the hell do you think
you're going, partner?

687
00:54:28,498 --> 00:54:30,295
We got work to do.

688
00:54:30,834 --> 00:54:32,802
Are you gonna let me in
on this thing or what?

689
00:54:33,003 --> 00:54:35,767
I'm starting to realize I have
more enemies than I thought.

690
00:54:36,239 --> 00:54:38,070
Everybody has more enemies
than they think.

691
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:41,176
But the only reason why Dale and
the other guys give you a lot of shit

692
00:54:41,378 --> 00:54:45,314
is because they're afraid
that you might be better than them.

693
00:54:53,823 --> 00:54:55,552
I love the way you eat.

694
00:55:00,263 --> 00:55:03,664
You know, John would never tell me
anything about my mother.

695
00:55:03,867 --> 00:55:07,530
It didn't matter what I asked,
just a complete no-fly zone.

696
00:55:09,039 --> 00:55:10,939
Except at dinner.

697
00:55:12,008 --> 00:55:14,169
He tells me I eat just like her.

698
00:55:14,377 --> 00:55:16,038
Two-fisted.

699
00:55:17,647 --> 00:55:19,444
Yeah.

700
00:55:19,649 --> 00:55:23,050
What can I say?
I get hungry.

701
00:55:27,557 --> 00:55:29,184
Me too.

702
00:55:41,705 --> 00:55:43,172
Sorry.

703
00:56:23,646 --> 00:56:26,945
<i>Sounds like a little animal</i>
<i>in your chest trying to get out.</i>

704
00:56:28,651 --> 00:56:31,017
<i>Sounds like flesh.</i>

705
00:56:35,291 --> 00:56:37,691
<i>You are in for a battle</i>
<i>on this one, Jess!</i>

706
00:56:37,894 --> 00:56:40,226
<i>I'm coming at you</i>
<i>with both guns blazing.</i>

707
00:58:08,084 --> 00:58:09,881
Ray?

708
00:58:16,326 --> 00:58:18,317
Ray?

709
00:58:22,465 --> 00:58:24,433
Anybody home?

710
00:58:29,806 --> 00:58:32,798
Ray, I am not jumping
in there with you.

711
00:59:15,251 --> 00:59:16,513
What is it?

712
00:59:16,719 --> 00:59:19,085
Looks like he was beaten,
thrown in the hot tub,

713
00:59:19,289 --> 00:59:21,757
and he's got the burn on the hand.

714
00:59:25,695 --> 00:59:28,163
Let's just get this over with.

715
00:59:31,267 --> 00:59:33,895
It'll take about five minutes.
It'll be standard form questions.

716
00:59:34,103 --> 00:59:35,900
<i>Let's go.</i>

717
00:59:36,539 --> 00:59:39,337
I still think it might be best
if we just pulled her off the case.

718
00:59:39,542 --> 00:59:41,373
Do you have any physical
evidence on her?

719
00:59:41,578 --> 00:59:44,046
Anything to indicate that she
might have killed these men?

720
00:59:44,247 --> 00:59:46,408
- No, of course not.
- Didn't think so.

721
00:59:46,616 --> 00:59:48,675
Just knowing them
is not proof of a crime.

722
00:59:48,885 --> 00:59:50,876
Proof of bad judgment, yes.

723
00:59:51,087 --> 00:59:53,078
But I'm not pulling her
from her first homicide case.

724
00:59:53,289 --> 00:59:56,520
It would kill her career.
She'll come through this. Just watch.

725
00:59:56,726 --> 00:59:59,889
<i>And your involvement</i>
<i>with all these victims was...</i>

726
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:02,727
Intimate?

727
01:00:03,066 --> 01:00:04,499
Yes.

728
01:00:05,802 --> 01:00:10,102
Do you think it's possible to do things
behind your own back?

729
01:00:10,506 --> 01:00:14,340
Maybe I drink too much.
I don't know. I...

730
01:00:14,544 --> 01:00:18,640
I pass out, and when I wake up
I think I've done terrible things.

731
01:00:18,848 --> 01:00:22,079
- What is it you think you've done?
- There's been another murder.

732
01:00:26,723 --> 01:00:29,089
And I'm my best suspect.

733
01:00:29,592 --> 01:00:32,356
This third victim...

734
01:00:33,296 --> 01:00:35,628
...I slept with him too.

735
01:00:36,733 --> 01:00:39,065
Jessica, listen to me.

736
01:00:39,702 --> 01:00:41,135
You grew up your whole life

737
01:00:41,337 --> 01:00:43,703
knowing that your father
has done these horrible things.

738
01:00:43,906 --> 01:00:48,366
So now you may be thinking,
"I have that in me too."

739
01:00:48,978 --> 01:00:51,173
I don't think I have it in me.

740
01:00:51,681 --> 01:00:52,909
I know.

741
01:00:54,183 --> 01:00:56,242
Am I losing my mind?

742
01:00:56,452 --> 01:01:00,252
<i>I have violent dreams. Flashes.</i>

743
01:01:00,790 --> 01:01:04,055
<i>- I'm hearing voices.</i>
<i>- When did you first find out?</i>

744
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:07,195
<i>When did you realize that</i>
<i>you had the capacity to kill?</i>

745
01:01:09,565 --> 01:01:12,591
<i>To take a human life?</i>

746
01:01:59,449 --> 01:02:01,349
Get away from me. Go!

747
01:02:41,991 --> 01:02:43,754
Hey.

748
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:45,587
I...

749
01:02:46,329 --> 01:02:47,626
...need this right away.

750
01:02:48,431 --> 01:02:51,525
Right away takes 24 hours.

751
01:02:52,602 --> 01:02:55,036
Lisa, please. I need it.

752
01:03:00,643 --> 01:03:02,611
OK.

753
01:03:02,812 --> 01:03:04,040
I'll skip a couple of steps,

754
01:03:04,247 --> 01:03:07,944
and I'll run it straight through
the amplification process.

755
01:03:09,819 --> 01:03:12,185
You know, I always say,
you can tell a lot about a person

756
01:03:12,388 --> 01:03:14,481
from a drop of their blood.

757
01:03:14,924 --> 01:03:17,119
Can you tell
if they're a good person?

758
01:03:19,095 --> 01:03:20,790
Give me a little time.

759
01:03:27,837 --> 01:03:30,772
- Angela.
- Yes?

760
01:03:31,407 --> 01:03:33,375
I need you to run this up to the lab.

761
01:03:33,576 --> 01:03:37,637
Get a toxicology screening,
and I'm still gonna need to type it.

762
01:03:37,847 --> 01:03:40,145
- OK.
- Thank you.

763
01:03:50,993 --> 01:03:53,985
Hi, it's Lisa from the lab.

764
01:03:54,197 --> 01:03:56,290
I need to see you right away.

765
01:04:34,670 --> 01:04:37,537
<i>You're a goddamn psychopath!</i>
<i>You know that?</i>

766
01:04:41,444 --> 01:04:44,413
<i>- Bring me a drop of the killer's...</i>
<i>- I know about you.</i>

767
01:04:44,614 --> 01:04:46,741
<i>Let's say you come over</i>
<i>to my house Sunday morning.</i>

768
01:04:46,949 --> 01:04:49,042
<i>Are you thinking</i>
<i>about hitting me right now?</i>

769
01:04:49,252 --> 01:04:51,413
<i>Killing spree. Killing spree.</i>

770
01:04:53,122 --> 01:04:54,350
<i>Tell me something.</i>

771
01:04:54,557 --> 01:04:56,821
<i>... saw him with looked a lot like you.</i>

772
01:04:57,026 --> 01:04:59,494
<i>... l've ever seen that guy</i>
<i>leave the bar with was you.</i>

773
01:05:00,696 --> 01:05:03,324
<i>Have we eliminated</i>
<i>Inspector Shepard as a suspect?</i>

774
01:05:03,532 --> 01:05:06,558
<i>... keep dying around you?</i>

775
01:05:06,769 --> 01:05:08,361
<i>What is it you think you've done?</i>

776
01:05:17,413 --> 01:05:19,881
<i>I can hear your heart beating.</i>

777
01:05:20,583 --> 01:05:21,914
<i>One body at a time.</i>

778
01:05:22,718 --> 01:05:24,379
<i>Sounds like blood.</i>

779
01:05:24,587 --> 01:05:27,613
<i>I know you. You're me.</i>

780
01:05:27,823 --> 01:05:29,688
<i>At least we have a suspect.</i>

781
01:05:29,892 --> 01:05:32,759
<i>So now you may be thinking,</i>
<i>"I have that in me."</i>

782
01:05:32,962 --> 01:05:35,089
<i>We all have it in us.</i>

783
01:05:35,298 --> 01:05:38,392
<i>The capacity to kill.</i>
<i>Capacity to kill.</i>

784
01:07:00,583 --> 01:07:02,551
You OK?

785
01:07:04,353 --> 01:07:05,718
Why wouldn't I be OK?

786
01:07:09,392 --> 01:07:10,984
I tried calling you.

787
01:07:11,527 --> 01:07:13,961
Something's wrong. You know
that feeling you've been having

788
01:07:14,163 --> 01:07:17,997
that somebody's been following you?
I'm getting that same feeling tonight.

789
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:20,532
Something's gonna happen tonight.

790
01:07:23,572 --> 01:07:25,699
Get away from me.

791
01:07:37,286 --> 01:07:39,550
- Put the gun down.
- Go away.

792
01:07:41,457 --> 01:07:43,823
- What are you doing, Jess?
- Mike...

793
01:07:44,860 --> 01:07:46,521
Mike.

794
01:07:49,832 --> 01:07:52,733
You've been drinking.
You gotta stop.

795
01:07:52,935 --> 01:07:54,926
- You've gotta be strong.
- Mike...

796
01:07:55,137 --> 01:07:56,798
No.

797
01:08:03,012 --> 01:08:06,072
Give me the gun. Give me the gun.

798
01:08:14,123 --> 01:08:16,887
Everyone who kisses me...

799
01:08:17,093 --> 01:08:18,720
...turns up dead.

800
01:08:33,442 --> 01:08:35,376
No, they don't.

801
01:08:45,921 --> 01:08:47,752
Mike, don't go.

802
01:08:47,957 --> 01:08:50,721
I ain't going anywhere, stranger.

803
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:39,963
Hello?

804
01:10:43,539 --> 01:10:45,336
Mike?

805
01:11:10,032 --> 01:11:12,262
You asked to see me?

806
01:11:17,139 --> 01:11:19,801
Turn and face that wall.

807
01:11:21,710 --> 01:11:25,043
Test. The bulletin board behind you.

808
01:11:25,247 --> 01:11:26,976
Go.

809
01:11:28,617 --> 01:11:31,108
Crime scene photos.
Three black and white. Two color.

810
01:11:31,387 --> 01:11:34,948
Two black and white. Three color.

811
01:11:37,626 --> 01:11:40,618
What is going on with you?

812
01:11:40,829 --> 01:11:45,129
You know a couple of victims, so you
just let yourself fall to pieces, is that it?

813
01:11:46,068 --> 01:11:50,095
- I think I'm losing it, John.
- Hey, you have a job to do.

814
01:12:04,553 --> 01:12:06,851
- Hi, Jess.
- What the fuck, Jimmy?

815
01:12:12,528 --> 01:12:14,519
Jimmy, just go home.

816
01:12:14,730 --> 01:12:16,322
Oh, go home.

817
01:12:19,101 --> 01:12:21,092
Like I'm some kind of dog.

818
01:12:27,176 --> 01:12:29,440
Like I'm supposed to
obey you now?

819
01:12:31,547 --> 01:12:33,014
Is that it?

820
01:12:41,557 --> 01:12:43,855
We're gonna rumble?

821
01:13:10,686 --> 01:13:13,348
Open the fucking door, Jessica.

822
01:13:17,025 --> 01:13:19,152
Open the door.

823
01:13:29,638 --> 01:13:32,072
I'm coming to get you.

824
01:13:35,511 --> 01:13:37,604
I'm coming.

825
01:14:23,892 --> 01:14:25,655
Jessica Shepard?

826
01:14:26,495 --> 01:14:28,793
Chip Marshall, SID.

827
01:14:45,681 --> 01:14:48,241
Where were you
the night of September 25th,

828
01:14:48,450 --> 01:14:51,010
the night Bob Sherman was killed?

829
01:14:53,956 --> 01:14:55,514
I don't know.

830
01:15:01,296 --> 01:15:02,957
The night of October 1 st,

831
01:15:03,165 --> 01:15:05,895
the night Lawrence Geber
was murdered?

832
01:15:07,803 --> 01:15:10,772
- I don't know.
- The night of October 5th,

833
01:15:10,973 --> 01:15:12,873
the night Ray Porter was killed?

834
01:15:13,075 --> 01:15:14,975
I don't...

835
01:15:15,177 --> 01:15:17,111
...know.

836
01:15:22,584 --> 01:15:25,951
Jessica, did you kill these men?

837
01:15:27,489 --> 01:15:28,854
I don't...

838
01:15:29,057 --> 01:15:31,184
I don't know.

839
01:15:32,828 --> 01:15:35,626
I don't know.

840
01:15:39,635 --> 01:15:42,001
I'm sorry.

841
01:15:45,240 --> 01:15:46,867
I'm so sorry.

842
01:15:50,546 --> 01:15:53,344
I don't know what else
there is to say.

843
01:15:54,550 --> 01:15:58,782
I was raised to be a good girl,
but I was born to bad people.

844
01:16:00,355 --> 01:16:03,449
It's kind of comforting, in a way.

845
01:16:05,093 --> 01:16:08,221
I've been running from it all my life...

846
01:16:08,430 --> 01:16:11,593
...the fear of being the bad seed.

847
01:16:13,902 --> 01:16:17,360
But most of all, I feel bad for John.

848
01:16:19,675 --> 01:16:21,734
It's OK, though.

849
01:16:21,944 --> 01:16:23,935
It's good.

850
01:16:26,949 --> 01:16:29,349
It's good that I'm in here.

851
01:16:29,985 --> 01:16:32,749
It keeps other people safe.

852
01:16:35,724 --> 01:16:38,192
Have you given her any medication?

853
01:16:38,393 --> 01:16:41,089
- No, I've given her nothing.
- I didn't think so.

854
01:16:41,296 --> 01:16:43,856
The problem's not in her head,
it's in her bloodstream.

855
01:16:44,066 --> 01:16:48,093
- What's in her bloodstream?
- Report from forensics.

856
01:16:48,303 --> 01:16:50,430
I had them run her blood
through a drug screen.

857
01:16:50,639 --> 01:16:52,368
Rohypnol. Ever heard of it?

858
01:16:52,574 --> 01:16:54,804
Yeah, of course. Roofies.
It's a date rape drug.

859
01:16:55,510 --> 01:16:57,410
Completely incapacitating.

860
01:16:58,780 --> 01:17:01,806
Get dressed. You're out on bail.

861
01:17:02,284 --> 01:17:04,752
Thanks for all your help, doc.

862
01:17:04,987 --> 01:17:07,148
We won't be needing
your services anymore.

863
01:17:08,991 --> 01:17:12,154
All right, give me the headline. And
don't tell me you're not up for a test.

864
01:17:12,361 --> 01:17:13,919
This is the biggest test of your life,
inspector.

865
01:17:14,262 --> 01:17:16,287
Four men murdered.
Suspect slept with all of them.

866
01:17:16,498 --> 01:17:19,524
Incriminating evidence found on her
person the morning after the crimes.

867
01:17:19,735 --> 01:17:22,101
When she awakened
from a drug-induced blackout,

868
01:17:22,304 --> 01:17:25,330
which makes it physically impossible
for her to have committed the crime.

869
01:17:25,540 --> 01:17:27,167
- I didn't do it.
- Stick to business.

870
01:17:27,376 --> 01:17:29,742
The crime remains the same,
only the suspects change.

871
01:17:29,945 --> 01:17:31,913
- Who?
- What do they have in common?

872
01:17:32,514 --> 01:17:34,175
- Just me.
- Who knows your habits?

873
01:17:34,383 --> 01:17:36,943
Whose job is it to know
where you are at all times

874
01:17:37,152 --> 01:17:39,586
in case he might have to call you
at any hour of the day or night?

875
01:17:39,788 --> 01:17:41,949
No, you're off on that. Mike never
knew where I went at night.

876
01:17:42,157 --> 01:17:44,648
Didn't this start when you got
the new job, when you met him?

877
01:17:45,160 --> 01:17:46,957
It's not Mike.

878
01:17:48,397 --> 01:17:50,228
All right, I need you
to tell me where to go.

879
01:17:50,432 --> 01:17:52,195
Straight down Market
to the Embarcadero.

880
01:17:52,401 --> 01:17:54,961
- But why would Mike drug me?
- How better to incapacitate you

881
01:17:55,170 --> 01:17:58,537
while he went about the business
of doing what he had to do?

882
01:18:02,077 --> 01:18:05,012
Do you think he'd let you prowl
without following you?

883
01:18:05,947 --> 01:18:08,211
There were times when I felt like
I was being followed.

884
01:18:08,417 --> 01:18:11,318
Suspect follows the accused.
When? Where?

885
01:18:13,422 --> 01:18:16,152
The night she picked up
a man in a bar.

886
01:18:16,491 --> 01:18:18,857
Followed the victim back to his place
where he watched you

887
01:18:19,061 --> 01:18:22,497
do what you do through a window
or maybe a crack under the door.

888
01:18:22,931 --> 01:18:25,024
Just enough to make him crazy.

889
01:18:27,669 --> 01:18:30,194
Come on, inspector, I'm waiting
for you to tell me something.

890
01:18:30,405 --> 01:18:32,566
Suspect had...

891
01:18:34,176 --> 01:18:38,306
...intimate knowledge
of the habits of the accused.

892
01:18:39,881 --> 01:18:44,341
Access not only to her place,
but to her deepest fears.

893
01:18:44,553 --> 01:18:49,252
Plus, familiarity with the drug
that ultimately incapacitated her.

894
01:19:12,380 --> 01:19:15,747
Remember, he's a cop.
We give him the benefit of the doubt.

895
01:19:15,951 --> 01:19:20,115
No doubt. He'll get all
the benefits he deserves.

896
01:19:29,097 --> 01:19:30,962
You got out.

897
01:19:32,834 --> 01:19:34,495
Why didn't you come see me, Mike?

898
01:19:34,703 --> 01:19:37,604
Yeah, why didn't you
come see her, Mike?

899
01:19:39,608 --> 01:19:41,200
What do you mean?

900
01:19:41,409 --> 01:19:44,845
I was there. They brought me in.
They questioned the hell out of me.

901
01:19:45,046 --> 01:19:48,880
- I told them you were innocent.
- How could you be so sure?

902
01:19:50,385 --> 01:19:52,478
Hey, Jess.

903
01:19:53,155 --> 01:19:55,020
You're my partner.

904
01:19:55,257 --> 01:19:57,953
- We're partners.
- Partners lie for each other?

905
01:19:58,160 --> 01:20:00,526
- What are you talking about?
- Partners tell each other the truth.

906
01:20:00,729 --> 01:20:03,789
- Partners tell each other everything.
- Hey.

907
01:20:03,999 --> 01:20:06,661
Partners come see you
when you're in jail.

908
01:20:08,603 --> 01:20:11,470
- You didn't get my message?
- Oh, God. There was no message.

909
01:20:11,673 --> 01:20:13,698
- You're so fucking full of shit.
- I was there.

910
01:20:13,909 --> 01:20:15,536
Somebody put me
on the "no access" list.

911
01:20:15,744 --> 01:20:18,679
Excuse me, can I help you
with something over there?

912
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:21,440
Looks like you were having some
wine before we got here, Mike.

913
01:20:21,650 --> 01:20:23,447
You celebrating something?

914
01:20:23,652 --> 01:20:26,348
No, I'm not celebrating anything.
What the fuck is going on here?

915
01:20:26,555 --> 01:20:28,250
- I'd like to propose a toast.
- What?

916
01:20:30,091 --> 01:20:32,321
To Jessica. You got
a problem with that, Mike?

917
01:20:32,527 --> 01:20:34,586
No. Why would I
have a problem with that?

918
01:20:35,397 --> 01:20:38,059
What's going on here?
Is this some kind of joke?

919
01:20:38,266 --> 01:20:40,257
You gonna toast or what?

920
01:20:50,378 --> 01:20:52,471
Here's to my partner.

921
01:21:15,136 --> 01:21:17,036
OK...

922
01:21:18,373 --> 01:21:20,466
...somebody better
say something.

923
01:21:21,443 --> 01:21:23,172
Rohypnol.

924
01:21:24,279 --> 01:21:26,975
Rohypnol? Yeah, Rohypnol.

925
01:21:27,782 --> 01:21:29,477
- And? What?
- Date rape drug.

926
01:21:29,684 --> 01:21:32,448
- You ever heard of it?
- Of course I've heard of it. Roofies.

927
01:21:32,654 --> 01:21:36,090
Roofies. That's what you
hip guys call it, right?

928
01:21:36,291 --> 01:21:38,919
I seem to remember you had
a little girlfriend who OD'd and died

929
01:21:39,127 --> 01:21:42,153
from this stuff. So you know
what Roofies do, don't you?

930
01:21:42,364 --> 01:21:43,729
What the fuck is going on here?

931
01:21:43,932 --> 01:21:47,390
Somebody has been following me
since these murders began.

932
01:21:47,602 --> 01:21:49,467
Someone has been drugging me.

933
01:21:50,071 --> 01:21:53,700
- How?
- Somebody who was lurking around.

934
01:21:53,909 --> 01:21:57,401
- You know, who was in my place.
- Incapacitate you, don't they?

935
01:21:57,612 --> 01:22:02,140
They make you feel
confused and anxious?

936
01:22:02,350 --> 01:22:03,783
You...

937
01:22:03,985 --> 01:22:06,112
...feeling confused, Mike?

938
01:22:06,321 --> 01:22:10,189
- Any anxiety?
- You put something in my wine.

939
01:22:10,792 --> 01:22:13,693
Whoa, this is quite a stash
you got here, Mike.

940
01:22:16,364 --> 01:22:17,956
- Stash?
- A little of this stuff

941
01:22:18,166 --> 01:22:21,829
must go a long way. You plan on date
raping a whole sorority house here?

942
01:22:22,037 --> 01:22:24,096
You planting evidence?

943
01:22:26,041 --> 01:22:28,942
Shit! This is not my stuff.

944
01:22:29,144 --> 01:22:30,577
Listen to me, this is not my stuff.

945
01:22:30,879 --> 01:22:34,679
- Party drugs.
- Whoa, lookie here what I found.

946
01:22:35,050 --> 01:22:38,781
This is one of those...
What do you call it?

947
01:22:39,521 --> 01:22:41,045
A Yawara.

948
01:22:41,256 --> 01:22:44,191
Those little Japanese sticks
that pound your features to a pulp.

949
01:22:44,392 --> 01:22:46,121
It's not mine.

950
01:22:46,494 --> 01:22:47,984
They didn't have these in my day,

951
01:22:48,196 --> 01:22:49,629
but I heard you're an expert
with one of these.

952
01:22:49,831 --> 01:22:53,392
- That's not mine.
- This one's got some blood on it.

953
01:22:54,135 --> 01:22:56,126
I wonder if that's Jimmy's blood.

954
01:22:56,338 --> 01:22:58,568
You think that could be poor Jimmy's?

955
01:22:58,773 --> 01:23:00,468
You didn't care too much for him,
did you?

956
01:23:00,675 --> 01:23:03,576
I seem to remember you threatened
to kill the poor bastard.

957
01:23:05,013 --> 01:23:07,413
You're not going for your gun,
are you, Mike?

958
01:23:12,554 --> 01:23:14,818
- Mike!
- No, no, no, no!

959
01:23:15,023 --> 01:23:17,355
No bruises. Just take it easy.

960
01:23:17,559 --> 01:23:19,720
Take it easy.

961
01:23:33,408 --> 01:23:36,866
We're in this together now. Partners.

962
01:23:37,679 --> 01:23:40,204
And now you understand.

963
01:23:47,689 --> 01:23:50,658
So we got a cop killer here.

964
01:23:51,292 --> 01:23:53,283
A man who's committed
a very special crime

965
01:23:53,495 --> 01:23:58,159
that requires a very
special form of justice.

966
01:23:58,900 --> 01:24:03,462
Step one, make sure
the crime scene is clean.

967
01:24:03,671 --> 01:24:05,434
Don't you touch anything, darling.

968
01:24:05,640 --> 01:24:10,339
Step two, no sign of
physical restraints or struggle.

969
01:24:10,979 --> 01:24:13,072
Step three...

970
01:24:17,419 --> 01:24:19,387
...motive.

971
01:24:20,021 --> 01:24:25,982
In this case, I'd say,
oh, remorse for what he's done.

972
01:24:27,295 --> 01:24:30,355
Unlucky in love.
That always works too.

973
01:24:30,565 --> 01:24:32,658
What are you doing?

974
01:24:41,276 --> 01:24:43,005
Tomorrow...

975
01:24:43,211 --> 01:24:46,237
...when those crime scene
boys show up...

976
01:24:46,448 --> 01:24:48,609
Photos never lie.

977
01:24:48,817 --> 01:24:51,217
They also save on those messy
courtroom appearances

978
01:24:51,419 --> 01:24:55,116
and some asshole judge
letting him out on bail.

979
01:24:55,323 --> 01:24:57,518
<i>And now you understand.</i>

980
01:24:59,094 --> 01:25:01,528
We're in this together.
Give me the weapon.

981
01:25:19,447 --> 01:25:21,415
- Step away from Mike.
- What?

982
01:25:23,251 --> 01:25:26,311
Put your hands behind your head,
and get on your knees.

983
01:25:26,521 --> 01:25:29,422
- Don't you understand?
- Understand what?

984
01:25:29,624 --> 01:25:32,388
- I'm doing this for you!
- Get on your knees!

985
01:25:32,594 --> 01:25:35,358
Put your hands behind your head!

986
01:25:36,664 --> 01:25:41,158
Rule number one,
you gotta be crazy to be a cop.

987
01:25:43,004 --> 01:25:44,266
You ever heard that old saying,

988
01:25:44,506 --> 01:25:49,205
"Everybody runs away from a man with
a gun, but a cop runs toward him"?

989
01:25:50,445 --> 01:25:52,379
Give me the gun, Jess.
You're not gonna use it.

990
01:25:52,580 --> 01:25:56,277
Do it! Do it! Do it!

991
01:25:56,484 --> 01:25:58,816
Your father had that same rage.

992
01:25:59,687 --> 01:26:03,680
I told him about her. I had to!
He was my partner!

993
01:26:03,892 --> 01:26:08,920
You tell your partner everything!
You always tell your partner the truth!

994
01:26:09,130 --> 01:26:13,089
I told him she was fucking
that hippie scum!

995
01:26:13,301 --> 01:26:16,270
He lost his mind, ran in the house,
I heard arguing.

996
01:26:16,671 --> 01:26:19,868
Look, all my life, I wished that...

997
01:26:20,074 --> 01:26:21,974
Hey!

998
01:28:22,497 --> 01:28:24,761
You killed them all.

999
01:28:26,100 --> 01:28:27,658
They were scum.

1000
01:28:27,869 --> 01:28:29,962
Don't you understand, darling?

1001
01:28:30,171 --> 01:28:32,935
They weren't good enough
for you and her.

1002
01:28:33,808 --> 01:28:36,902
You have the same
emotional problem.

1003
01:28:37,111 --> 01:28:40,478
You have her disease.
I've tried to cure you.

1004
01:28:40,682 --> 01:28:44,812
- You cured my mother by killing her?
- She was ruining my life.

1005
01:28:45,019 --> 01:28:49,149
She was ruining her life
and your father's life.

1006
01:28:49,357 --> 01:28:51,348
I loved her.

1007
01:28:51,559 --> 01:28:54,528
I couldn't let her keep doing those
things. There was no other way.

1008
01:28:54,729 --> 01:28:57,960
You killed my father.
You couldn't stop killing.

1009
01:28:59,534 --> 01:29:01,525
Stop?

1010
01:29:01,736 --> 01:29:06,196
I stopped for all those years,
and I can stop again.

1011
01:29:07,809 --> 01:29:10,334
Control, Jess.

1012
01:29:10,545 --> 01:29:12,638
It's all about control.

1013
01:29:16,050 --> 01:29:18,075
Give me the gun.

1014
01:29:19,354 --> 01:29:22,221
I kill you, I kill a fleeing felon.

1015
01:29:22,423 --> 01:29:25,415
You kill me, you commit murder.

1016
01:29:26,294 --> 01:29:28,159
<i>We've heard everything you said,</i>
<i>commissioner.</i>

1017
01:29:28,663 --> 01:29:30,392
<i>You don't need the gun,</i>
<i>commissioner.</i>

1018
01:29:32,433 --> 01:29:36,460
Test. Identify the voice
you are listening to.

1019
01:29:37,105 --> 01:29:39,369
<i>I'm here, Jess. I got you.</i>

1020
01:29:39,574 --> 01:29:42,475
Recognize the voice of Officer Wilson,
my old patrol partner?

1021
01:29:42,677 --> 01:29:46,374
<i>Go along with the program, sir.</i>
<i>You don't want to destroy her.</i>

1022
01:29:46,581 --> 01:29:47,809
Move. Come on, come on.

1023
01:29:48,015 --> 01:29:50,210
<i>Let her get the capture,</i>
<i>commissioner.</i>

1024
01:29:50,418 --> 01:29:52,079
<i>Hold him there, Jess. I'm coming.</i>

1025
01:29:52,286 --> 01:29:54,811
Maybe some asshole judge
will cut you some slack.

1026
01:29:58,926 --> 01:30:03,488
<i>10-4. Backup units rolling.</i>
<i>Code three. We're on our way, Jess.</i>

1027
01:30:10,738 --> 01:30:13,571
Well done, inspector. Well done.

1028
01:30:14,475 --> 01:30:16,409
You outsmarted the master.

1029
01:30:16,611 --> 01:30:18,476
That means I did my job well.

1030
01:30:18,679 --> 01:30:20,579
There's just one more test
you have to pass.

1031
01:30:23,551 --> 01:30:24,882
Don't!

1032
01:30:25,420 --> 01:30:26,853
No room for mistakes.

1033
01:30:29,724 --> 01:30:31,089
- Test.
- No!

1034
01:30:56,484 --> 01:30:59,248
- Mike.
- There she is. Let's go. Move it!

1035
01:31:01,622 --> 01:31:06,025
- Come on, we got one in the water.
- Officer down. Call it in.

1036
01:31:07,462 --> 01:31:09,987
There's no uniforms down here.
Get the paramedics.

1037
01:31:10,198 --> 01:31:13,190
Always got your back, Jess.
You OK?

1038
01:31:22,543 --> 01:31:25,205
- It's cold out here, kids.
<i>- This is Marine One. On our way.</i>

1039
01:31:25,413 --> 01:31:27,142
Copy that.

1040
01:31:41,028 --> 01:31:44,191
Marine One, get someone in the water
right away to retrieve the body.

1041
01:31:44,398 --> 01:31:45,990
Follow my light.

1042
01:31:46,200 --> 01:31:49,101
- See us? Right here in front of the dock.
- Mike?

1043
01:31:49,570 --> 01:31:51,265
Mike?

1044
01:31:51,472 --> 01:31:53,167
Mike?

1045
01:31:54,242 --> 01:31:56,540
I'm so sorry.

1046
01:31:58,312 --> 01:32:00,712
I'm sorry I thought you were the guy.

1047
01:32:04,218 --> 01:32:06,846
I am the guy.

1048
01:32:12,326 --> 01:32:15,056
I'll see you later, stranger.
