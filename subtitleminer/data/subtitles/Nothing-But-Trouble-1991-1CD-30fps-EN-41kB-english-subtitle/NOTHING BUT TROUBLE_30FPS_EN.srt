I WIN. I DEAL.

1320
01:03:57,483 --> 01:03:58,484

1321
01:03:58,484 --> 01:03:59,485

1324
01:04:03,990 --> 01:04:05,992

SUSPEND ALL SENTENCES.
YOU'RE FREE TO GO.

HEY. HOLD THE HARVEST.

1392
01:07:06,672 --> 01:07:08,174
THERE IS ANOTHER MATTER

1393
01:07:08,174 --> 01:07:09,675

THIS EVENING.

1394
01:07:10,176 --> 01:07:11,177

1399
01:07:23,055 --> 01:07:25,057
FIRST YOU OUGHTA
KNOW SOMETHING.

1400
01:07:25,558 --> 01:07:26,559
IN MANY CASES HERE,

1401
01:07:26,559 --> 01:07:27,560
I DO OFTEN CHOOSE

1402
01:07:27,560 --> 01:07:29,562
TO INVEIGH
THE MAXIMUM LEVY.

1403
01:07:29,562 --> 01:07:32,565
FREQUENTLY, UNDESIRABLES
ARE PUT TO DEATH.

1404
01:07:32,565 --> 01:07:34,066
I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT.

1405
01:07:34,066 --> 01:07:36,569
COME ON. BUT DEATH
FOR RUNNING A STOP SIGN?

1406
01:07:36,569 --> 01:07:38,571
AND FOR BEING
A BANKER.

1407
01:07:38,571 --> 01:07:40,072
THAT'S
THE DOUBLE DEATH.

1408
01:07:40,072 --> 01:07:41,574
HOWEVER,

1409
01:07:41,574 --> 01:07:42,575
I'D BE WILLING

1410
01:07:42,575 --> 01:07:45,077
TO CAST ASIDE
ALL FINDINGS,

1411
01:07:45,077 --> 01:07:47,079
BE BLIND TO
YOUR BANKER'S BLOOD,

1412
01:07:47,079 --> 01:07:50,082
LET YOU LIVE OUT
YOUR DAYS HERE

1413
01:07:50,082 --> 01:07:52,084
AS HUSBAND
TO MY GRANDDAUGHTER,

1414
01:07:52,084 --> 01:07:53,586
FATHER TO HER CHILD,

1415
01:07:53,586 --> 01:07:56,088
AND HEIR TO MY SEAT.

1416
01:07:58,591 --> 01:08:00,593
WHA-WHAT ARE
YOU SAYING?

1417
01:08:01,594 --> 01:08:03,095
IT'S DEATH OR ELDONA?

1418
01:08:03,095 --> 01:08:04,597
OH, COME ON, LAD.

1419
01:08:04,597 --> 01:08:06,098
TAKE HER HAND.

1420
01:08:06,098 --> 01:08:08,100
WARM MY TIRED
OLD HEART.

1421
01:08:08,100 --> 01:08:09,602
I KNOW WOMEN.

1422
01:08:09,602 --> 01:08:11,103
SHE LOVES YOU.

1423
01:08:11,103 --> 01:08:13,105
EVER SINCE
SHE SAW YOU,

1424
01:08:13,105 --> 01:08:14,106
SHE'S BEEN
FLOATING AROUND

1425
01:08:14,106 --> 01:08:15,107
LIKE MILKWEED
IN A SPRING BREEZE.

1426
01:08:15,107 --> 01:08:16,609
UH-HUH.

1427
01:08:16,609 --> 01:08:18,110
MAKE HER HAPPY.

1428
01:08:18,110 --> 01:08:20,112
TAKE CARE
OF HER NEEDS,

1429
01:08:20,112 --> 01:08:22,114
AND YOU'LL INHERIT
A FORTUNE

1430
01:08:22,114 --> 01:08:24,617
ALI BABA
WOULD CRAVE.

1431
01:08:27,620 --> 01:08:29,121
LISTEN, JUDGE.

1432
01:08:30,623 --> 01:08:32,625
UH...

1433
01:08:32,625 --> 01:08:36,128
YOU KNOW, I'VE--I'VE SPENT
SOME TIME ALONE WITH HER,

1434
01:08:36,128 --> 01:08:38,631
AND SHE'S
A SPECTACULAR WOMAN.

1435
01:08:38,631 --> 01:08:41,133
SHE'S QUIET
BUT, UH, JUST SHY.

1436
01:08:41,133 --> 01:08:42,134
MUTE.

1437
01:08:42,134 --> 01:08:43,636
AH.

1438
01:08:43,636 --> 01:08:46,639
BUT, JUDGE, AS FAR AS
HER NEEDS ARE CONCERNED,

1439
01:08:46,639 --> 01:08:50,142
I COULD NEVER PRESUME
TO BE ABLE TO FILL THEM.

1440
01:08:50,142 --> 01:08:52,144
OH, YOU CAN SLIP ON
A PUD COLLAR.

1441
01:08:52,144 --> 01:08:53,646
NOW, LET ME GET YOU

1442
01:08:53,646 --> 01:08:54,647
OUT OF THESE CUFFS
AND CHAINS,

1443
01:08:55,147 --> 01:08:56,649
AND I'LL GET YOU
ALL MARRIED UP,

1444
01:08:56,649 --> 01:08:58,150
AND WE'LL WELCOME

1445
01:08:58,651 --> 01:09:01,120
WITH AN
ALL-NIGHT REEL.

1446
01:09:02,621 --> 01:09:03,622

1447
01:09:03,622 --> 01:09:05,124

01:09:09,128 --> 01:09:11,630
WELL, I MUST SAY...

1450
01:09:11,630 --> 01:09:13,632
IT SOUNDS
AWFULLY TEMPTING.

1451
01:09:15,634 --> 01:09:16,635
HIT IT.

1452
01:09:17,136 --> 01:09:19,138
YO. DROP IT, J.
