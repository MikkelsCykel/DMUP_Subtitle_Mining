00:00:02,577 --> 00:00:05,580
Alright, fellas. Stand up for
the count. Stand up.

2
00:00:05,914 --> 00:00:07,707
Hayman.
- Here.

3
00:00:09,375 --> 00:00:10,627
Hathford.
-- Here.

4
00:00:11,127 --> 00:00:12,587
Morning ladies, morning.

5
00:00:12,795 --> 00:00:14,130
Ellersby.

6
00:00:15,381 --> 00:00:16,633
Madlock.

7
00:00:18,843 --> 00:00:19,677
McChaughney.

8
00:00:19,886 --> 00:00:21,846
Let's move it.

9
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:26,768
{y:i}You asked me about
my worst secret.

10
00:00:27,602 --> 00:00:30,313
{y:i}My most personal secret.

11
00:00:32,065 --> 00:00:34,817
{y:i}The secret of all my secrets.

12
00:00:36,986 --> 00:00:38,446
{y:i}...but first

13
00:00:40,657 --> 00:00:42,825
{y:i}I'm Vince Rizzo.

14
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:48,248
{y:i}I wanna begin by telling you
about where I live.

15
00:00:50,667 --> 00:00:53,878
{y:i}City Island is a fishing village
located in Le Bronx, New York.

16
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:56,256
{y:i}Not City Island is distinct
from the rest of Le Bronx

17
00:00:56,589 --> 00:00:58,758
{y:i}by virtue of being located
on its own two-lane spit

18
00:00:59,008 --> 00:01:00,843
{y:i}right in the middle of the South.

19
00:01:01,177 --> 00:01:03,763
{y:i}Most people don't believe
it until they see it.

20
00:01:04,013 --> 00:01:07,100
{y:i}And within the one square mile
that comprises all there is of City Island

21
00:01:07,433 --> 00:01:09,185
{y:i}lies yet another distinction.

22
00:01:09,435 --> 00:01:12,647
{y:i}That of the mussel sucker
versus the clam digger.

23
00:01:14,107 --> 00:01:17,944
{y:i}The mussel sucker is an island resident
who moved here from somewhere else.

24
00:01:18,278 --> 00:01:22,448
{y:i}The clam diggers like myself were
born and bred on City Island.

25
00:01:22,657 --> 00:01:26,202
{y:i}preferably in the same house which've
been handed down to other generations.

26
00:01:26,536 --> 00:01:28,288
{y:i}In short, the world can be divided between

27
00:01:28,496 --> 00:01:30,373
{y:i}Clam diggers and mussel suckers.

28
00:01:30,582 --> 00:01:34,210
{y:i}Those who stay and
those who wander.

29
00:01:38,381 --> 00:01:42,385
{y:i}You asked me about my worst secret
my most personal secret

30
00:01:42,552 --> 00:01:44,762
{y:i}The secret of all my secrets.

31
00:01:45,471 --> 00:01:47,056
{y:i}Well, like most of us...

32
00:01:49,142 --> 00:01:51,227
{y:i}I guess I have a few.

33
00:01:54,355 --> 00:01:56,441
Vince, I need the blow dryer.

34
00:02:00,194 --> 00:02:03,114
Vince, I need the blow dryer.
- Coming.

35
00:02:11,581 --> 00:02:13,750
- Hey Vinnie, are you ready for your test today?
- Totally.

36
00:02:13,958 --> 00:02:16,669
I'm gonna start my car.
Be there in five minutes.

37
00:02:25,428 --> 00:02:26,679
Morning.

38
00:02:34,896 --> 00:02:37,523
Hey, call Vivian, will you?
Find out what bus she's taking.

39
00:02:37,732 --> 00:02:39,192
Is she staying over?

40
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,860
Spring break.
She's here all week.

41
00:02:41,069 --> 00:02:43,488
We'll probably go out
for Mexican tonight.

42
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:46,366
I can't, I got a poker game.

43
00:02:46,616 --> 00:02:48,159
You're daughter is home from college
and all you can think about...

44
00:02:48,284 --> 00:02:49,744
She's here all week, right?

45
00:02:49,953 --> 00:02:52,455
Just make an early dinner and don't
let it start with me, please.

46
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:56,292
Somewhat, Vince, you were fixing
the boatshed or tearing it down.

47
00:03:02,757 --> 00:03:05,677
Pick whatever you want,
coz I don't have time, alright.

48
00:03:50,513 --> 00:03:51,681
Hey, Sheryl.

49
00:03:51,973 --> 00:03:54,601
Do you want to do something?
I'm not going to class.

50
00:03:54,893 --> 00:03:56,978
- Like what?
- I don't know.

51
00:03:58,771 --> 00:04:00,315
Feed you some donuts.

52
00:04:00,523 --> 00:04:02,400
Feed me donuts?

53
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:05,945
Oh nice, just make a
fat joke, freak!

54
00:04:06,988 --> 00:04:10,116
I'm gonna lock it.
Watch the gates.

55
00:04:22,128 --> 00:04:23,963
Alright fellas. Stand up
for the count.

56
00:04:27,133 --> 00:04:28,885
Alright morning ladies, morning.

57
00:04:33,598 --> 00:04:36,392
Is it a meeting?
Would you like his voicemail?

58
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:44,234
He played a poker
game last night.

59
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,777
Wait.

60
00:04:46,402 --> 00:04:47,862
Nirhof?

61
00:04:49,822 --> 00:04:51,407
Nardela?

62
00:05:05,255 --> 00:05:07,048
Listen, who are the new guys?

63
00:05:07,257 --> 00:05:10,510
Well we got a Bogart, he transferred
from upstate and a Nardela

64
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:13,805
Yeah, Nardela, who's is she?

65
00:05:14,138 --> 00:05:16,015
It's the same old thing, man.

66
00:05:17,058 --> 00:05:20,520
Grand theft auto, out with
coke with attempt to sell.

67
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:22,605
Done 3 out 5 at the South Court.

68
00:05:22,772 --> 00:05:24,774
Pile him up on us
due to overcrowding.

69
00:05:24,983 --> 00:05:27,610
It says here, that his parole is provisional.

70
00:05:27,819 --> 00:05:29,988
Be released to a closest living relative.

71
00:05:30,196 --> 00:05:32,198
Yeah, he's gonna do 30 days on the outside...

72
00:05:32,365 --> 00:05:35,410
if he had a family member who
would've claimed his sorry grand theft ass.

73
00:05:35,827 --> 00:05:38,246
He said, he's gotta finish
out the rest of his town.

74
00:05:38,454 --> 00:05:40,832
That was a tough break.
-- He will get out eventually.

75
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,626
And then he can go back
to boosting Ferrari's.

76
00:05:43,877 --> 00:05:46,462
Well, it says it was an Impala.

77
00:05:49,173 --> 00:05:52,302
Who boost Impala's?

78
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:54,804
Stealing the wrong kind of car.

79
00:05:56,973 --> 00:05:58,349
Hey, sweetheart.
How are you doing?

80
00:05:58,558 --> 00:06:00,226
How's my future college grad?

81
00:06:00,435 --> 00:06:01,895
Fine. Whatever.

82
00:06:02,103 --> 00:06:05,565
Listen. Your mom wants to know
what you wanna do all week.

83
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:06,566
All week?

84
00:06:06,816 --> 00:06:08,776
Yeah, you know, for your spring break.

85
00:06:09,485 --> 00:06:11,487
Oh, right.

86
00:06:11,905 --> 00:06:13,990
Did you make other plans
or something? You forget?

87
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:17,410
No, of course not.
I just, have work...

88
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:22,540
Well, bring your books. Take the
six o'clock and I'll pick you up.

89
00:06:22,749 --> 00:06:24,918
You don't have to do that...

90
00:06:25,251 --> 00:06:28,171
I know I don't have to do that
but I wanna do it because I love you.

91
00:06:28,379 --> 00:06:30,048
I'll pick you up.

92
00:06:30,882 --> 00:06:32,425
I love you too.

93
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:37,847
Blue shirt, you're on.

94
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:43,269
I'm losing the whole week full of shifts.
Forgot about spring break.

95
00:06:43,603 --> 00:06:46,731
Why don't you take a vacation
like the other kids?

96
00:07:10,797 --> 00:07:13,424
You don't have to come, dad.
I could've have rented a car service.

97
00:07:13,633 --> 00:07:17,178
Scholarships don't pay for car service.
They pay for your education.

98
00:07:17,387 --> 00:07:19,681
Did you bring your books?

99
00:07:19,889 --> 00:07:20,515
No.

100
00:07:20,723 --> 00:07:22,892
Don't you got to study or nothing?

101
00:07:23,142 --> 00:07:24,477
Fine. Whatever. Dad.

102
00:07:24,686 --> 00:07:28,731
Well, you know, I'm just concerned
that you don't fall behind in your studies.

103
00:07:28,982 --> 00:07:29,816
Stop, dad

104
00:07:29,983 --> 00:07:32,485
- Yeah, I'm concerned about your education, you know
- Stop, dad!

105
00:07:39,158 --> 00:07:42,620
You got yourself like 20 feet in front of
you and you can stop like over there

106
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:46,499
and you got still 20 feet. Keep this thing out.
Get this piece of junk out of here.

107
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:51,921
Just get it out of here.
Get in your car.

108
00:08:09,022 --> 00:08:12,442
Well, that's great Vince, beautiful!
A thing of beauty!

109
00:08:12,942 --> 00:08:17,864
Yeah, you like it, huh. I did it on purpose.
I knew you'd like it so much.

110
00:08:20,366 --> 00:08:23,703
We're just having a sale in White Plains.
We should go tomorrow.

111
00:08:23,912 --> 00:08:24,871
Sure.

112
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:28,291
Maybe we'll go to the Botanical Gardens.
Vinnie said he wanted to go.

113
00:08:28,499 --> 00:08:30,460
I, what?
- To the botanical gardens.

114
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:33,296
Botanical Gardens?

115
00:08:33,504 --> 00:08:37,133
You're serious about going
to the botanical gardens?

116
00:08:37,383 --> 00:08:41,304
I'm just saying there are much more
interesting things that we could do.

117
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:46,643
We can tie ourselves to the couch and watch
Cartoon Network for 48 hours straight or something like that.

118
00:08:46,851 --> 00:08:51,564
And maybe afterwards you know,
we could take a tour of the zip lock bag factory.

119
00:08:51,731 --> 00:08:52,899
That will be fun.

120
00:08:53,107 --> 00:08:54,776
Vinnie, shut up.

121
00:08:54,984 --> 00:08:57,403
You shut up Vivian, seriously.

122
00:08:57,779 --> 00:08:58,947
Shut up, man.

123
00:09:00,198 --> 00:09:04,369
My heart, my heart, somebody call an ambulance.
I need help. I need help.

124
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:05,620
That's enough.

125
00:09:05,828 --> 00:09:07,914
So when's he leaving this
phase of stupid adolescence?

126
00:09:08,122 --> 00:09:09,999
Never, he's never leaving high school.

127
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:13,002
coz he thinks he's too smart
to go to any of his classes.

128
00:09:14,796 --> 00:09:18,258
To get an "A".
Oh sweet! I got an "A".

129
00:09:18,466 --> 00:09:22,428
I'm having so much fun looking
at this letter on a piece of paper.

130
00:09:22,637 --> 00:09:24,097
5 more of this letter
on this piece of paper...

131
00:09:24,264 --> 00:09:26,683
...and I can get a 4.0 GPA average.

132
00:09:26,891 --> 00:09:30,770
For what? So I can grow up and
become another meaningless...

133
00:09:31,062 --> 00:09:33,856
Prison guard? Like your father
who also does not have a college degree.

134
00:09:34,107 --> 00:09:34,607
Nice.

135
00:09:34,816 --> 00:09:36,776
That's not what I was gonna say but...

136
00:09:37,026 --> 00:09:38,027
Excuse me.

137
00:09:38,278 --> 00:09:40,864
First of all, it's a correctional officer

138
00:09:41,072 --> 00:09:43,283
and you know what happens
if you don't go to college?

139
00:09:43,575 --> 00:09:45,118
You wind up answering phones for a living.

140
00:09:45,243 --> 00:09:47,036
That's nice for you,
if you wanna hear that kind of stuff.

141
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,205
I went to Ianto.

142
00:09:50,456 --> 00:09:52,959
Two years on Ianto which is
not exactly a Harvard degree.

143
00:09:53,167 --> 00:09:55,670
Well, if I hadn't gotten pregnant
I would've gotten my degree.

144
00:09:55,879 --> 00:09:57,881
Great, mom. So I supposed
that ties the game.

145
00:09:58,089 --> 00:09:59,966
Do not spoil my college degree.

146
00:10:00,174 --> 00:10:02,343
I'm just saying if I hadn't gotten pregnant
I would've had a degree.

147
00:10:02,552 --> 00:10:06,931
Yeah, but you wouldn't have hers.
So what? Degree, you daughter?

148
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,017
We all know what you're saying.

149
00:10:10,059 --> 00:10:12,770
Where are you going?
- I got a poker game.

150
00:10:15,273 --> 00:10:17,775
Play hard, pops.
- Shut up, Vinnie.

151
00:10:18,067 --> 00:10:21,112
My life is falling apart.
It's all crumbling.

152
00:10:21,321 --> 00:10:23,198
Louder, I can't hear you.

153
00:10:23,406 --> 00:10:25,700
I need to know
you love me.

154
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:28,912
I...

155
00:10:30,163 --> 00:10:31,539
Say it.

156
00:10:36,127 --> 00:10:37,253
Jesus Christ.

157
00:10:37,503 --> 00:10:38,213
Yes.

158
00:10:40,298 --> 00:10:41,758
I love you.

159
00:10:41,966 --> 00:10:44,594
Wait a minute, why
did you need to pause here?

160
00:10:44,761 --> 00:10:47,680
What were all those pauses for?
What were they?

161
00:10:47,931 --> 00:10:48,765
What do you mean?

162
00:10:48,932 --> 00:10:52,602
You said 2 lines and I
counted 4 pauses in 2 lines.

163
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:55,104
Why do you need a pause
before you say, "what"?

164
00:10:55,313 --> 00:10:59,067
Oh, he's stalling for time.
- Why? I mean does he love her or does he not love her?

165
00:10:59,275 --> 00:11:03,863
He does love her.
- So what the hell you need to pause for? Listen.

166
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:08,451
We have the Collar Moratorium on pauses.

167
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:10,328
Five years of my life is going out the window...

168
00:11:10,537 --> 00:11:12,830
...listening to pauses in this room.
I can't do it anymore.

169
00:11:13,164 --> 00:11:15,333
So we gotta cut out the pauses.

170
00:11:15,542 --> 00:11:18,795
In 2000 years of theatre history

171
00:11:18,878 --> 00:11:20,755
you'll never find anybody pausing.

172
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,466
The only pause - they either
or they listen.

173
00:11:23,675 --> 00:11:26,803
They did their acting while they were talking.

174
00:11:27,011 --> 00:11:31,182
All of a sudden, Marlon Brando comes
in to the picture about 45, 50 years ago.

175
00:11:31,307 --> 00:11:33,560
And everybody says:
"Oh my God, the man is a genius."

176
00:11:33,685 --> 00:11:35,144
Did you see him thinking?

177
00:11:35,228 --> 00:11:39,524
Did you see Brando in the fugitive kind?
Anybody see that?

178
00:11:39,732 --> 00:11:42,652
Somebody asked Brando
what his name is.

179
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:45,572
He's gonna think about it.

180
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:47,240
Why does he have to think about that?

181
00:11:47,448 --> 00:11:49,534
Takes me half an hour
to get back to the guy.

182
00:11:49,659 --> 00:11:53,830
It's not acting and
it's not thinking. It's just...

183
00:11:54,539 --> 00:11:57,750
well, it's just bullshit.
No more pauses!

184
00:11:57,876 --> 00:12:00,670
If you wanna think, think in
the privacy of your own heart.

185
00:12:00,795 --> 00:12:02,881
Otherwise, very nice work.
Very good.

186
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:06,634
Okay, everybody up. Stretch.
Nice deep stretch.

187
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:16,102
I can't talk right now.

188
00:12:17,687 --> 00:12:19,772
I don't know maybe Monday.

189
00:12:20,815 --> 00:12:23,192
Just give my shift to Autumn.

190
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:25,278
Alright bye.

191
00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:29,866
Who was that?

192
00:12:31,659 --> 00:12:32,702
Work.

193
00:12:33,203 --> 00:12:36,789
And you, and you...
Okay.

194
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:42,378
All the people I've mentioned turn
left and face your new partner.

195
00:12:43,463 --> 00:12:44,589
Go on, say hello.

196
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,218
Hi, I'm Molly Charlsworth.
- Hi, Vince Rizzo.

197
00:12:48,468 --> 00:12:50,637
Nice to meet you.
- Likewise.

198
00:12:51,888 --> 00:12:54,599
Your assignment for next week is...

199
00:12:54,724 --> 00:12:57,227
to find the most embarrassing...

200
00:12:57,310 --> 00:13:00,980
the most unspeakable thing you can think of...
your secret of secrets...

201
00:13:01,064 --> 00:13:04,400
and you're gonna share it
with you new partner.

202
00:13:04,484 --> 00:13:06,903
So what are you gonna do
with your partner's secret?

203
00:13:07,111 --> 00:13:08,988
You're gonna use to find the courage...

204
00:13:09,072 --> 00:13:11,991
to dramatize your own secret
which you've been trying to hide...

205
00:13:12,116 --> 00:13:13,993
within an inch of your lives...

206
00:13:14,202 --> 00:13:16,496
and you're gonna present
it to us next week...

207
00:13:16,579 --> 00:13:20,333
in the form of a monologue
with no pauses. Is that clear?

208
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:22,335
Good. Any questions?

209
00:13:22,418 --> 00:13:25,463
Very good. Good class!

210
00:13:28,258 --> 00:13:29,926
So then to get her money in her room...

211
00:13:30,051 --> 00:13:32,762
you said your father didn't get
himself, he just tried to kill your mother.

212
00:13:32,845 --> 00:13:35,265
Only, my mother was away
and my father was a drunk.

213
00:13:35,348 --> 00:13:38,184
It's when their wedding
put an end, come to life.

214
00:13:38,268 --> 00:13:42,564
So my brother and I went to stay with
my aunt on her plantation in Hawaii...

215
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:45,775
And my brother turned to
opium byproducts.

216
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:52,574
And I got shackled off to so dusty and
best forgotten European boarding schools.

217
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:57,787
Wow.

218
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:03,418
What happened to your brother?

219
00:14:03,626 --> 00:14:05,920
Oh God, no, I'm sorry...

220
00:14:09,257 --> 00:14:12,594
It's just not very useful
for these purposes.

221
00:14:13,011 --> 00:14:15,638
You see, the problem is I've told
this secret about a million times.

222
00:14:15,722 --> 00:14:18,016
I've auditioned with it, in fact...

223
00:14:18,141 --> 00:14:20,518
So it's your turn, Vince
and I'm stuck.

224
00:14:20,643 --> 00:14:23,646
I don't know. Is it possible
that I don't have one?

225
00:14:23,855 --> 00:14:24,898
No.

226
00:14:25,315 --> 00:14:29,485
That would make far too healthy
towards being an actor.

227
00:14:32,906 --> 00:14:36,242
Fat Chicks Bronx New York

228
00:14:47,629 --> 00:14:49,297
Come on, think.

229
00:14:52,425 --> 00:14:54,928
Well, for one thing...
I mean, right here...

230
00:14:55,428 --> 00:14:58,598
my wife right now thinks that
I got a poker game tonight.

231
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:02,018
You mean, instead of telling her
you've enrolled in an acting class...

232
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:04,520
you told her you're out gambling.

233
00:15:04,938 --> 00:15:06,397
Is that better?

234
00:15:06,522 --> 00:15:09,192
Well, it's kinda hard to
explain, but yeah.

235
00:15:09,317 --> 00:15:12,237
You see, my wife she wouldn't go...

236
00:15:12,445 --> 00:15:14,948
she wouldn't go for the fact
that I wanna be an actor.

237
00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:17,450
How very refreshing!

238
00:15:19,202 --> 00:15:20,995
Yeah, I guess.

239
00:15:22,038 --> 00:15:25,041
Come on, tell it to me.

240
00:15:25,792 --> 00:15:28,086
Like you were confessing it.

241
00:15:29,629 --> 00:15:32,882
I am Vince Rizzo, you asked
me about my worst secret...

242
00:15:33,091 --> 00:15:36,135
my most personal secret.

243
00:15:36,219 --> 00:15:40,056
Well, my wife she thinks I got
a poker game tonight...

244
00:15:56,573 --> 00:15:57,907
...and it's bullshit.

245
00:15:59,576 --> 00:16:02,287
What do you mean?
You could do worse?

246
00:16:02,704 --> 00:16:04,372
Yeah, try me.

247
00:16:05,206 --> 00:16:06,875
I hardly know you.

248
00:16:07,083 --> 00:16:09,168
I know, isn't it lovely?

249
00:16:13,131 --> 00:16:15,842
I just met my son.

250
00:16:16,759 --> 00:16:17,844
Where?

251
00:16:18,344 --> 00:16:21,055
In the facility where I work,
I'm a correctional officer.

252
00:16:21,264 --> 00:16:22,849
You're a prison guard?

253
00:16:23,558 --> 00:16:25,518
Well, sort of...
Yeah.

254
00:16:28,563 --> 00:16:31,691
And how old is he, you're son?
- He's 24.

255
00:16:35,111 --> 00:16:36,487
His name is Tony.

256
00:16:40,116 --> 00:16:41,701
Tony Nardela.

257
00:16:44,204 --> 00:16:47,332
This is brilliant.
How did you recognize him?

258
00:16:47,457 --> 00:16:50,043
Well, his name it just popped
right out from the rap sheet.

259
00:16:50,126 --> 00:16:53,046
You know, Nardela because
that was his mom, mom's name.

260
00:16:53,296 --> 00:16:57,467
and he was born in Campton, New Jersey
which is where she lived.

261
00:16:57,884 --> 00:17:00,887
I wasn't actually there
with them coz I took off.

262
00:17:03,181 --> 00:17:06,726
Have you ever told your
current wife about him?

263
00:17:07,769 --> 00:17:10,563
Or about his mother?
- No.

264
00:17:12,148 --> 00:17:13,900
Or about any of it?

265
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:18,404
I always meant to, but...

266
00:17:20,281 --> 00:17:22,992
I could never find the right time.

267
00:17:25,995 --> 00:17:27,997
He's really handsome.

268
00:17:34,337 --> 00:17:35,838
FeedingDenise.com

269
00:17:36,839 --> 00:17:40,593
{y:i}Hi, I'm Denise and
I'm a proud BBW.

270
00:17:40,718 --> 00:17:44,264
{y:i}That's "Big, Beautiful Woman",
for those new to this.

271
00:17:44,347 --> 00:17:48,017
{y:i}I'm 5'8", 350 pounds and
I think eating...

272
00:17:48,101 --> 00:17:51,771
{y:i}and feeding a sexy woman
is the sexiest thing in the world.

273
00:17:51,896 --> 00:17:53,648
{y:i}If you join my club...

274
00:17:53,856 --> 00:17:57,110
{y:i}you'll get 24-hour access
to a live view of my kitchen...

275
00:17:57,193 --> 00:18:00,321
{y:i}where I spend the most of my
time when I'm not working.

276
00:18:01,155 --> 00:18:05,034
{y:i}Hi, I'm Denise and
I'm a proud BBWW.

277
00:18:05,118 --> 00:18:08,663
{y:i}That's "Big, Beautiful Woman"
for those new to this.

278
00:18:09,289 --> 00:18:11,457
My wife, she's a fighter,
she's tough...

279
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:13,042
she has very firm opinions on things.

280
00:18:13,126 --> 00:18:15,879
You just wanna make sure
she's fighting on your side.

281
00:18:16,045 --> 00:18:18,131
Wow, she sounds like the real thing.

282
00:18:18,339 --> 00:18:22,010
Oh yeah, she's the real thing.
And she looks great too.

283
00:18:22,135 --> 00:18:25,471
She's very beautiful.
But you know, lately...

284
00:18:26,306 --> 00:18:28,391
somewhat it's like we're
not friends anymore.

285
00:18:31,811 --> 00:18:37,233
The reappearance of your secret
lovechild might well provide a solution. - How?

286
00:18:37,442 --> 00:18:41,404
He'll provide a dangerous
symbol of your own virility.

287
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:44,532
She'll be reminded of all the things
that attracted her to you to begin with...

288
00:18:44,741 --> 00:18:48,703
You see, the Vincent
she never really knew...

289
00:18:48,828 --> 00:18:51,915
Is the Vincent she seeks
or she wants back.

290
00:18:52,999 --> 00:18:56,628
Does that make any sense?
- No, but you know...

291
00:18:56,836 --> 00:18:59,130
women are emotionally incoherent.

292
00:18:59,339 --> 00:19:01,633
It's the most defining characteristic.

293
00:19:01,841 --> 00:19:05,178
I do some of my best work by a cellular.

294
00:19:08,723 --> 00:19:12,268
Call me, Vincent but
only on a win.

295
00:19:16,356 --> 00:19:17,065
Good night.

296
00:19:51,683 --> 00:19:55,228
I was thinking as you know, being a
Saturday night and all and Vivian's here...

297
00:19:55,311 --> 00:19:59,482
Why don't we have a big
home cook dinner tonight?

298
00:19:59,732 --> 00:20:02,610
Big, nice, big.
- Yeah sure, like I do every Saturday night.

299
00:20:02,735 --> 00:20:05,446
Yeah, but like you know,
something special.

300
00:20:05,572 --> 00:20:09,742
Like for a real special occasion
or something special.

301
00:20:10,869 --> 00:20:12,537
You want balloons or something?

302
00:20:12,745 --> 00:20:15,039
No, I don't want balloons or something.
I'm just saying something nice.

303
00:20:15,248 --> 00:20:19,419
When don't I make it nice?
- Make something nicer. Make it yourself!

304
00:20:21,004 --> 00:20:23,172
The great communicator.

305
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,263
You went outside last night?

306
00:20:31,514 --> 00:20:32,682
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

307
00:20:32,974 --> 00:20:36,436
I did heroine with a bunch of
prostitutes at the Plaza Hotel.

308
00:20:36,644 --> 00:20:38,813
I'm thinking of becoming a pimp.

309
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:41,524
Good. I'll see you later.

310
00:21:10,094 --> 00:21:13,223
My name is Vince Rizzo
Correctional Officer 426.

311
00:21:21,064 --> 00:21:24,984
Says here you made provisional parole
but you got no family to be released to.

312
00:21:25,235 --> 00:21:26,361
Yeah, that's life.

313
00:21:26,569 --> 00:21:28,780
You got a mother named Nen.
- Yeah.

314
00:21:29,697 --> 00:21:32,200
5 foot 2, red headed.

315
00:21:32,492 --> 00:21:33,159
Yeah.

316
00:21:33,451 --> 00:21:34,702
How is she doing?

317
00:21:35,245 --> 00:21:37,330
Not so good. She's dead.

318
00:21:37,622 --> 00:21:39,207
About 4 years ago.

319
00:21:46,089 --> 00:21:47,549
I'm sorry to hear that.

320
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,926
Why? You know her?

321
00:21:50,134 --> 00:21:51,928
Yeah, I know her.

322
00:22:01,813 --> 00:22:04,732
Anything else?
- Yeah, there's something else.

323
00:22:08,278 --> 00:22:10,864
I spoke to Warden Amboy.

324
00:22:13,074 --> 00:22:14,951
You're gonna be released to me.

325
00:22:15,785 --> 00:22:18,079
You're gonna be in my personal
care for the next 30 days.

326
00:22:18,288 --> 00:22:20,915
I live in Le Bronx.
Get the prisoner ready.

327
00:23:36,282 --> 00:23:39,536
Can I ask you like why
I'm chained to a Ford?

328
00:23:39,702 --> 00:23:43,581
I'm gonna unchain you, Tony
but first I gotta tell you something.

329
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:46,084
See this house here?

330
00:23:46,292 --> 00:23:47,544
That's my home.

331
00:23:47,752 --> 00:23:50,463
My grandfather built this home
and I share it with my family.

332
00:23:50,672 --> 00:23:52,966
Well, you got them chained
up in the house too?

333
00:23:54,217 --> 00:23:55,802
You're gonna get real nice food...

334
00:23:55,969 --> 00:23:57,971
and a real nice place to live
for the first time in 3 years.

335
00:23:58,304 --> 00:24:00,139
So you better behave yourself.

336
00:24:01,391 --> 00:24:04,561
And all these, because you
knew my bitch mother.

337
00:24:04,727 --> 00:24:08,731
Well, I got to admit your mom
can be difficult sometimes but...

338
00:24:09,023 --> 00:24:10,900
but she was also...

339
00:24:13,611 --> 00:24:15,697
drunk and a whore.

340
00:24:16,114 --> 00:24:17,365
Why do you call her that?

341
00:24:17,574 --> 00:24:20,410
She used to punish me
when I booze in cases of Vodka

342
00:24:20,702 --> 00:24:22,579
from the liquor store I worked
at by screwing my friends

343
00:24:22,787 --> 00:24:24,873
which makes her
drunk and a whore.

344
00:24:25,081 --> 00:24:26,958
Don't you have any
fun memories of her?

345
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:30,712
Well, she was always around,
my father left before I was born.

346
00:24:36,551 --> 00:24:39,053
What do you know about him?
- He's dead.

347
00:24:41,681 --> 00:24:42,682
That's too bad.

348
00:24:45,435 --> 00:24:47,395
The only thing that's too
bad is that I didn't get a chance...

349
00:24:47,604 --> 00:24:49,772
to visit his deathbed and
dance in his ugly face

350
00:24:49,898 --> 00:24:51,566
for leaving me with that bitch.

351
00:24:51,774 --> 00:24:52,942
Okay, let's go!

352
00:25:01,367 --> 00:25:04,495
I'll go with a handcuff?
- I'll unchain you in a minute.

353
00:25:04,704 --> 00:25:07,415
I don't want you running away before I show
you what kind of setup I did for you.

354
00:25:07,624 --> 00:25:09,792
Run away, why would I do that?

355
00:25:16,382 --> 00:25:18,259
You said this was a house.

356
00:25:26,392 --> 00:25:28,061
This is it.

357
00:25:28,478 --> 00:25:31,606
I started fixing it a couple of years ago
but I got busy with other things.

358
00:25:31,898 --> 00:25:35,652
Here's the deal: You're gonna
help me put a bathroom in here.

359
00:25:36,819 --> 00:25:37,654
Excuse me?

360
00:25:37,862 --> 00:25:40,365
A bathroom. My wife always wanted
a bathroom and as I figured...

361
00:25:40,657 --> 00:25:42,575
you know, I saw in your sheet
you're a handy man.

362
00:25:42,742 --> 00:25:46,329
30 days you build a bathroom with me.
Once you're through, I'll pay you a fair wage

363
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:49,832
You can go wherever the hell you want
with a few bucks in your pocket. That's the deal.

364
00:25:50,166 --> 00:25:53,294
How am I supposed to build
a bathroom with handcuffs on me?

365
00:25:57,173 --> 00:25:58,925
Don't go running away from me, Tony.

366
00:26:01,427 --> 00:26:05,598
Coz if you do, I'm gonna personally
come after you. Understand me?

367
00:26:07,892 --> 00:26:10,103
I'll throw your ass back in the cage.

368
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:12,480
And this time they ain't gonna be kidding.

369
00:26:12,689 --> 00:26:15,191
They're gonna put you away
for a long stretch, you understand me?

370
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,943
Yeah, whatever.

371
00:26:17,902 --> 00:26:19,571
Yeah, whatever.

372
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:26,035
Why don't you try: "Okay, Vince
I promise you that"?

373
00:26:27,704 --> 00:26:30,623
Okay Vince, I promise you that.

374
00:26:34,043 --> 00:26:35,837
Why don't you try...

375
00:26:36,671 --> 00:26:40,300
"Thank you Vince for getting
my ass out of the cage."

376
00:26:41,384 --> 00:26:43,136
Spit it out.

377
00:26:48,141 --> 00:26:50,560
Thanks for getting me out of the cage.
- You're welcome.

378
00:26:50,852 --> 00:26:53,354
And don't be talking shit about your
mother she wasn't perfect but she was...

379
00:26:53,563 --> 00:26:55,023
...she was a good lay.

380
00:26:57,650 --> 00:26:59,068
Yeah, whatever.

381
00:27:07,327 --> 00:27:08,786
Shit, my wife.

382
00:27:08,995 --> 00:27:11,497
Is that what you call her?
Shit, my wife.

383
00:27:13,082 --> 00:27:14,834
I don't smoke.
- Yeah, I can tell.

384
00:27:15,043 --> 00:27:16,920
Whatever you do just don't
mention the prison thing.

385
00:27:17,128 --> 00:27:19,088
Just say we're old friends.

386
00:27:19,339 --> 00:27:21,174
Are we in a bowling team together?

387
00:27:21,424 --> 00:27:24,427
My daughter's back from college
so you better take it easy.

388
00:27:24,761 --> 00:27:26,930
And don't mention that I knew
you mother. It's bad news.

389
00:27:27,138 --> 00:27:29,349
I'll tell you when you can come out.

390
00:27:34,437 --> 00:27:37,273
Anybody home?
- I'm here.

391
00:27:38,525 --> 00:27:43,530
So is dad, he's out back,
handcuffed to some biker dude.

392
00:27:43,696 --> 00:27:45,907
...been back there for quite
some time. Bullshit.

393
00:27:48,409 --> 00:27:51,538
You bring some filthy
biker into my house

394
00:27:51,746 --> 00:27:55,291
without even so much as asking me.
- He's not a biker, he's a nice young man...

395
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,794
he's gonna be working for his board.
- Where did you meet this guy anyway?

396
00:27:58,002 --> 00:28:00,505
He's getting out of jail in a month.
I told them I will take responsibility for him.

397
00:28:00,713 --> 00:28:02,173
Oh my God, Vince.

398
00:28:02,382 --> 00:28:05,301
What? You just pick that con at random
and bring him into my house?

399
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:08,555
I don't pick no con at random,
I happened to know his mother.

400
00:28:08,846 --> 00:28:10,390
What?

401
00:28:10,723 --> 00:28:14,269
His mother, I happened
to know his mother.

402
00:28:15,645 --> 00:28:17,605
What do you mean?
Who was she?

403
00:28:17,814 --> 00:28:20,733
Mom, now you think he never knew
any woman before you? Calm down.

404
00:28:20,942 --> 00:28:23,653
Are you serious?
- I knew his mother. She was like a...

405
00:28:23,862 --> 00:28:25,947
No! No! No!

406
00:28:35,748 --> 00:28:40,128
...because it's my house!
- He cannot stay here, Vince! Do you understand me?

407
00:28:43,756 --> 00:28:46,676
Before we go on, I'd like
to thank my beautiful wife, Joycie

408
00:28:46,801 --> 00:28:50,013
for this special dinner
that she prepared.

409
00:28:50,263 --> 00:28:52,223
Yeah, it looks great, Mom!

410
00:28:52,432 --> 00:28:53,057
Thank you.

411
00:28:53,266 --> 00:28:56,519
I like to welcome
Tony to our table.

412
00:28:57,854 --> 00:29:02,108
Good times ahead. Nothing but
good, sweet, breezy times.

413
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:07,030
Plus the food is gotta be
like at least marginally...

414
00:29:07,363 --> 00:29:10,158
better than that shit
they serve in jail, right?

415
00:29:10,783 --> 00:29:12,035
What's the matter with you?

416
00:29:12,368 --> 00:29:15,163
My peptic ulcer!

417
00:29:15,872 --> 00:29:18,208
You have to watch it!
-- Vinnie, shut up.

418
00:29:18,374 --> 00:29:24,214
No, yo, you shut up, get off my ass.
What're you gonna do?

419
00:29:24,631 --> 00:29:28,218
Vince tells me that he was
friends with your mother.

420
00:29:30,178 --> 00:29:32,680
Yeah, a long time ago, I guess.

421
00:29:32,972 --> 00:29:34,349
I guess so.

422
00:29:34,766 --> 00:29:36,976
Well, I never heard about it.

423
00:29:37,268 --> 00:29:40,897
It was because...it was
before we met, sweetie.

424
00:29:41,314 --> 00:29:46,027
He says she was a very nice
woman, good looking too, I bet.

425
00:29:49,489 --> 00:29:50,740
Here we go.

426
00:29:50,907 --> 00:29:54,077
Mom, Dad's right, why don't
we just be upfront here...

427
00:29:54,244 --> 00:29:58,248
come out with it, just ask him
if he had sex with this woman.

428
00:29:58,748 --> 00:30:00,208
Apologize to me.

429
00:30:00,416 --> 00:30:02,085
That's my brain tumor.

430
00:30:02,293 --> 00:30:05,213
Well, he does have a point.

431
00:30:07,090 --> 00:30:12,428
With all due respect, it is
what you were getting at.

432
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,848
I don't care if you had
sex with her or not.

433
00:30:16,057 --> 00:30:17,725
Why are you two
gaining up on me?

434
00:30:17,934 --> 00:30:18,768
Come on, Joycie...

435
00:30:18,977 --> 00:30:22,188
you know, after 20 years I know
where you're going before even you do.

436
00:30:22,438 --> 00:30:25,775
Well, that must be very
boring for you, Vince. Really.

437
00:30:25,942 --> 00:30:28,570
Who knew that I was failing to keep
you entertained all these years.

438
00:30:28,778 --> 00:30:31,072
Mom, he didn't mean it like that.
- You're taking his side too now?

439
00:30:31,281 --> 00:30:36,911
I'm not taking any sides.
I'm just saying...

440
00:30:37,453 --> 00:30:41,624
You know, dad says some things
in stupid ways sometimes.

441
00:30:41,916 --> 00:30:46,713
In a stupid way? Now your dad is
stupid for some reason all of a sudden?

442
00:30:46,921 --> 00:30:48,798
I meant you said it
in a stupid way.

443
00:30:49,007 --> 00:30:50,258
You just said that I
was sounding stupid.

444
00:30:50,466 --> 00:30:53,803
You might talk to your colleagues,
to your college friends but...

445
00:30:54,137 --> 00:30:56,389
you don't talk to your father like that.
- Well, you blame her for a real education.

446
00:30:56,639 --> 00:30:59,225
I'm not saying anything about it,
I'm just saying she can't talk to me...

447
00:30:59,434 --> 00:31:02,061
Why? Do you have to bring college into it?
- No, you brought college into it!

448
00:31:02,228 --> 00:31:04,981
Stop, guys!
Just stop.

449
00:31:05,148 --> 00:31:06,816
She's telling I'm stupid in the
front of the dining room table.

450
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:08,902
Dad, stop!

451
00:31:16,534 --> 00:31:18,620
Want some cheese?
- Yeah, sure.

452
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:23,833
Okay Vivian, I've got
to ask you a question.

453
00:31:25,585 --> 00:31:26,544
What?

454
00:31:28,421 --> 00:31:30,423
Are your breast continuing
to grow? Because...

455
00:31:30,506 --> 00:31:33,218
and this is to my endeavor, way bigger.
- What are you doing?

456
00:31:33,426 --> 00:31:35,720
How dare you talk
to your sister like that?

457
00:31:35,929 --> 00:31:40,433
Get in my room? Pretty lame, mom.
It's a little old school.

458
00:31:40,516 --> 00:31:44,604
Don't talk to your
mother like that.

459
00:31:45,438 --> 00:31:47,815
Go to your room, right now.
- I like this family. This is nice.

460
00:31:48,024 --> 00:31:51,986
My room's got everything.
Everything I need is in my room.

461
00:31:52,195 --> 00:31:54,614
Hey, you want me to get up?
I'm getting up.

462
00:31:54,781 --> 00:31:58,368
It's not my punishment.
I'm done. I'm done. I'm leaving.

463
00:32:01,162 --> 00:32:03,122
Unbelievable.

464
00:32:34,946 --> 00:32:35,780
What?

465
00:32:35,989 --> 00:32:36,614
Vince?

466
00:32:36,906 --> 00:32:37,574
What?

467
00:32:44,539 --> 00:32:47,166
He does have a point there, sweetie.
I mean...

468
00:32:47,333 --> 00:32:49,544
It does seem to be getting
larger in that area.

469
00:32:49,752 --> 00:32:50,587
Jesus, dad!

470
00:32:50,795 --> 00:32:53,423
What's the matter with you?
Where're you going?

471
00:32:55,508 --> 00:32:58,303
That girl buries her head
in her books, 18 hours a day.

472
00:32:58,511 --> 00:33:00,930
She comes home for a little
quality family time...

473
00:33:01,014 --> 00:33:02,473
and you gotta go and screw it up.

474
00:33:02,599 --> 00:33:05,602
What's screwed up? I'm just saying they're
getting larger. 'twas a compliment.

475
00:33:05,685 --> 00:33:06,644
Oh my God!

476
00:33:06,769 --> 00:33:09,564
What's the matter with you guys?
- Inappropriate!

477
00:33:09,689 --> 00:33:12,483
I'm inappropriate? I'm the guy here
who's trying to hold this thing together.

478
00:33:12,692 --> 00:33:15,945
What's the matter with you guys, huh?
The hell with this.

479
00:33:16,654 --> 00:33:18,615
The hell with all of you's.

480
00:33:26,247 --> 00:33:29,459
Dinner was great.
Thank you.

481
00:33:36,466 --> 00:33:39,177
Hey, Molly.
Yeah, it's me. Vince.

482
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:42,722
I'm calling you on a whim.

483
00:33:55,235 --> 00:33:56,569
Spring break over?

484
00:33:56,694 --> 00:34:01,908
Just out here to watch the show.
Take off early tonight, split a shit with me.

485
00:34:01,991 --> 00:34:05,745
Highly unlikely. Agent
Invasion is out of force.

486
00:34:10,875 --> 00:34:14,003
Shit, I could've cleaned up this week.

487
00:34:14,629 --> 00:34:16,089
Have a drink.

488
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:38,945
My husband thinks I quit.

489
00:34:41,614 --> 00:34:45,201
One good thing about the joint.
They don't let you smoke anymore so...

490
00:34:46,119 --> 00:34:47,787
I quit inside.

491
00:34:48,121 --> 00:34:50,707
Being in prison and
not being able to smoke?

492
00:34:50,915 --> 00:34:52,792
That's like being in jail.

493
00:34:53,543 --> 00:34:55,086
Join me.

494
00:35:02,719 --> 00:35:04,554
You got to tell them, I mean...

495
00:35:04,679 --> 00:35:08,725
...the longer it goes about not knowing who
you really are, the greater her sense of betrayal.

496
00:35:08,850 --> 00:35:10,727
And she's been betrayed enough.

497
00:35:11,352 --> 00:35:13,646
Yeah, and it all started
when I walked off.

498
00:35:13,730 --> 00:35:15,648
No, don't do that.

499
00:35:16,232 --> 00:35:18,318
Things come to self-flagellation.

500
00:35:19,068 --> 00:35:20,945
I mean, I understand it of course.

501
00:35:21,154 --> 00:35:25,950
It was one of the Catholic of you and
everything but you're beyond it.

502
00:35:29,078 --> 00:35:32,207
You've opened up your
home to a convicted felon.

503
00:35:32,498 --> 00:35:34,709
You'd shown him huge trust...

504
00:35:34,918 --> 00:35:37,003
by leaving him alone
there with your family.

505
00:35:37,086 --> 00:35:39,005
Oh, Jesus, that's all I need.

506
00:35:39,088 --> 00:35:41,591
No, because he's your
flesh and blood.

507
00:35:41,799 --> 00:35:44,385
If you can't trust your own blood
then what the hell can you trust.

508
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:49,933
Vince, come on, it's time for you to just
take the final step and fill his part right there.

509
00:35:52,852 --> 00:35:55,563
He started that boatshed 3 years ago...

510
00:35:55,855 --> 00:35:58,691
with enough wooden junk
to build a forest.

511
00:36:00,985 --> 00:36:04,030
This is gonna be his new career,
building things.

512
00:36:04,322 --> 00:36:07,033
He gets discouraged when
things take too long.

513
00:36:07,784 --> 00:36:09,953
Like more than an hour.

514
00:36:11,412 --> 00:36:13,831
And him? and his poker games.

515
00:36:14,123 --> 00:36:16,834
Does he really think
I'd buy that crap?

516
00:36:18,378 --> 00:36:20,380
- What is it in "New Screen and Stage"?

517
00:36:20,463 --> 00:36:23,716
The Wall Street Journal
is staging actors.

518
00:36:25,468 --> 00:36:28,805
You prove yours, that's it.
A new open course...

519
00:36:28,930 --> 00:36:32,350
Parts that are never get
and projects that are never made.

520
00:36:33,101 --> 00:36:34,769
For instance...

521
00:36:37,564 --> 00:36:41,985
Here, open call, male, 30-50

522
00:36:42,485 --> 00:36:46,239
working class type,
no agency rep required.

523
00:36:46,573 --> 00:36:50,326
Auditions will be held Monday,
9 AM, Barret St, Armond.

524
00:36:52,704 --> 00:36:54,163
That would be a good one for you.

525
00:36:54,247 --> 00:36:58,001
...Yeah, no kidding.

526
00:36:58,334 --> 00:37:00,753
Does it also say, if you got
no age, you're not qualified?

527
00:37:01,045 --> 00:37:03,006
Does it say no talent?

528
00:37:20,648 --> 00:37:24,194
So what happens, you go to
that street and then what happens?

529
00:37:24,736 --> 00:37:27,322
You've never been to an audition before?
- No.

530
00:37:29,115 --> 00:37:31,492
Oh Vincent, it's dreadful.

531
00:37:32,327 --> 00:37:33,578
What?

532
00:37:33,995 --> 00:37:36,915
Okay, so, you walk in...

533
00:37:37,248 --> 00:37:42,128
you wait in a room crowded with the faces
that look vaguely familiar in an explicit way.

534
00:37:42,337 --> 00:37:45,882
They mark you in, they stare
at you, they hate you.

535
00:37:45,965 --> 00:37:49,510
You sing and dance and throw a
baton, show off all the talents..

536
00:37:49,636 --> 00:37:51,846
that once thrilled your mother and father.

537
00:37:51,930 --> 00:37:55,683
They make faces, sometimes very rarely.
They ask you a question.

538
00:37:56,017 --> 00:37:57,769
Then you're dismissed
and you go home for the night.

539
00:37:57,852 --> 00:38:01,105
Content not peeing there.

540
00:38:02,273 --> 00:38:03,900
Sounds terrifying.

541
00:38:04,651 --> 00:38:06,653
But having said all that...

542
00:38:07,987 --> 00:38:11,115
you really should go for this one.
It sounds perfect for you, come on.

543
00:38:11,407 --> 00:38:14,035
Thank you very much.
You walked me off a cliff.

544
00:38:14,536 --> 00:38:16,246
{y:i}Welcome my new fat-friendly fan.

545
00:38:16,329 --> 00:38:18,706
{y:i}You're now officially
a member of my club.

546
00:38:18,831 --> 00:38:22,377
{y:i}If you see me out at the BBW
Function in the New York Metro area

547
00:38:22,585 --> 00:38:24,170
{y:i}you can tell me
you're a special member

548
00:38:24,254 --> 00:38:25,922
{y:i}by saying our secret word:

549
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:28,007
{y:i}"Botero"

550
00:38:56,995 --> 00:39:00,206
When you think about it, Vincent,
acting is one of the strangest things

551
00:39:00,331 --> 00:39:02,000
a person can possibly choose to do.

552
00:39:02,125 --> 00:39:06,170
Pretending to be someone else
who was dreamed up by some third party.

553
00:39:06,296 --> 00:39:09,382
It's like agreeing to be a marionette.

554
00:39:12,010 --> 00:39:13,887
Why do you act?

555
00:39:14,637 --> 00:39:18,266
Rarely, what other profession could have
committed my sort of behavior problems.

556
00:39:19,183 --> 00:39:22,562
Yeah, sort of like they pay
you for being a professional schooler.

557
00:39:23,354 --> 00:39:24,397
Perfect.

558
00:39:39,412 --> 00:39:42,040
I grew up with a mother
and no father.

559
00:39:43,082 --> 00:39:45,585
And my mother hated my father so much...

560
00:39:45,668 --> 00:39:50,715
for leaving. Then, she took it
out on me because I reminded her of him.

561
00:39:51,633 --> 00:39:54,969
I didn't even know him.
It's hilarious.

562
00:40:05,396 --> 00:40:07,774
Upstairs, my son's room
has a bunch of sweaters

563
00:40:07,899 --> 00:40:10,401
Second door on your left.

564
00:40:12,195 --> 00:40:13,530
Thank you.

565
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:31,881
Botero?

566
00:40:42,851 --> 00:40:44,811
Hello, who's there?

567
00:40:47,730 --> 00:40:50,650
So you thought any more
about your secret?

568
00:40:55,113 --> 00:40:56,698
All the time.

569
00:40:57,323 --> 00:40:59,826
For you to have a land of secrets.

570
00:40:59,909 --> 00:41:01,703
Yeah, skies.

571
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:05,874
That'll be very difficult for you
to decide which one is the best.

572
00:41:10,253 --> 00:41:12,422
Am I ever gonna get a chance to hear it?

573
00:41:13,172 --> 00:41:15,592
I don't mean to press you
or anything, it's just that...

574
00:41:15,675 --> 00:41:19,846
I'm feeling a little nervous
since we have a class in 3 days and...

575
00:41:21,097 --> 00:41:22,765
...I just wanna be helpful.

576
00:41:24,017 --> 00:41:25,894
Where do you live?

577
00:41:30,690 --> 00:41:31,941
Le Bronx.

578
00:41:32,025 --> 00:41:33,693
No thanks.

579
00:41:34,027 --> 00:41:35,069
What?

580
00:41:35,695 --> 00:41:37,447
Forget it, soak it in the ash.
I'm sorry.

581
00:41:37,572 --> 00:41:39,240
I'm sure Le Bronx is lovely.

582
00:41:39,365 --> 00:41:42,577
My part overly is,
the other part not so much.

583
00:41:42,785 --> 00:41:46,539
I lived in a place called City Island.
It's an old fishing village.

584
00:41:46,623 --> 00:41:48,416
Really?

585
00:41:50,084 --> 00:41:51,878
City Island

586
00:41:52,462 --> 00:41:55,590
For two worlds standing
apart really from each other.

587
00:41:56,132 --> 00:41:59,677
City: so short and abrupt and definite.

588
00:41:59,886 --> 00:42:03,014
and Island: it's subtle, unknown.

589
00:42:06,267 --> 00:42:08,353
..and with a silent "S".

590
00:42:09,062 --> 00:42:10,730
I would never...

591
00:42:12,273 --> 00:42:16,236
thought about it in those terms,
but yeah, it's a great spot.

592
00:42:16,569 --> 00:42:18,530
If you live there, you go up there...

593
00:42:19,072 --> 00:42:21,658
you would never think
about moving somewhere else.

594
00:42:32,210 --> 00:42:34,837
Good night, Tony.
Pleasant dreams.

595
00:42:35,964 --> 00:42:37,632
Good night, Mrs. Rizzo.

596
00:42:37,757 --> 00:42:41,386
Joyce.
- Mrs. Rizzo is Vince's mom.

597
00:42:48,059 --> 00:42:49,310
That's it.

598
00:42:50,061 --> 00:42:51,187
What?

599
00:42:51,813 --> 00:42:53,606
It's my secret.

600
00:42:56,609 --> 00:42:58,152
No, not yet.

601
00:42:59,946 --> 00:43:02,866
I needed it to stay mine
just for a little bit longer.

602
00:43:03,199 --> 00:43:05,785
Once you know, it's no
longer treated a secret.

603
00:43:08,288 --> 00:43:10,456
Be at the moment when it's obvious.

604
00:43:12,667 --> 00:43:14,460
Will you keep it with you?

605
00:43:14,836 --> 00:43:16,421
Yeah, of course.

606
00:43:22,468 --> 00:43:23,803
Vince.
-What?

607
00:43:28,641 --> 00:43:31,853
What a wonderful time
to not disappear.

608
00:44:18,149 --> 00:44:20,109
Where were you last night honey?

609
00:44:20,235 --> 00:44:21,903
Friends.

610
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:24,280
Where are you going?

611
00:44:24,948 --> 00:44:26,282
Beach.

612
00:45:12,579 --> 00:45:14,664
Okay, here's what I'm thinking...

613
00:45:15,164 --> 00:45:17,375
take the pipe and we'll run
it right through here.

614
00:45:17,584 --> 00:45:21,963
We angle it off, we chase the steps up
the hill and tap it to the main line.

615
00:45:22,171 --> 00:45:24,465
Feels good, son, don't you?

616
00:45:25,508 --> 00:45:28,761
You know, my grandfather built this
house way before I was born.

617
00:45:29,262 --> 00:45:30,722
Yeah, you told me.

618
00:45:30,847 --> 00:45:34,267
He came from the old country.
He became a fish scaler.

619
00:45:34,684 --> 00:45:36,769
Yeah?
- Yeah, him and his brother.

620
00:45:36,978 --> 00:45:39,189
Couple of young mussel suckers.

621
00:45:41,149 --> 00:45:42,942
How's that?

622
00:45:44,694 --> 00:45:47,197
City Island has an old custom.

623
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:51,784
If you come from somewhere else
you're known as a "mussel sucker."

624
00:45:52,118 --> 00:45:57,290
But if you're born and raised here
like myself, you're a "clam digger"

625
00:45:57,707 --> 00:45:59,500
Clam digger.

626
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:02,212
Mussel sucker.

627
00:46:07,008 --> 00:46:09,219
Hey, you wanna see something?
- No.

628
00:46:09,302 --> 00:46:10,887
Really.
- Are you sure?

629
00:46:10,970 --> 00:46:12,222
Go away.

630
00:46:12,305 --> 00:46:14,516
If could mess with your head like forever.

631
00:46:15,141 --> 00:46:17,435
I'd wanna see it.

632
00:46:23,274 --> 00:46:24,734
Where did you get that?

633
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:30,657
Dad hides it in the bathroom.

634
00:46:57,267 --> 00:46:59,853
Hey, relax, relax.
It's just me.

635
00:47:01,437 --> 00:47:03,523
You scared the hell out of me.

636
00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:05,400
What's that?

637
00:47:05,608 --> 00:47:07,360
What?
- That.

638
00:47:13,950 --> 00:47:16,035
It's between you and me, okay.

639
00:47:16,119 --> 00:47:18,872
It's an open call for a movie tomorrow.

640
00:47:20,832 --> 00:47:22,375
So?

641
00:47:25,003 --> 00:47:28,047
Ever since I was a little kid
I wanted to become an actor.

642
00:47:28,339 --> 00:47:30,633
I thought it was something I could do.

643
00:47:31,050 --> 00:47:33,970
I've been taking acting classes
over there in the city.

644
00:47:40,018 --> 00:47:43,771
Nobody knows. Joyce don't know.
Nobody knows.

645
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:46,900
It's kinda stupid.
She thinks I got a poker game.

646
00:47:47,108 --> 00:47:49,068
Well, what you really had
going on is an acting class?

647
00:47:49,194 --> 00:47:50,653
I got an acting class.

648
00:47:50,862 --> 00:47:56,075
Another friend of mine who goes to the classes,
explaining to me what it's like going on auditions.

649
00:47:56,701 --> 00:48:00,872
Doesn't sound like it's for me.
- You should give it a shot if that's what you wanna do.

650
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:03,791
It's what I wanna do
but I'm no actor.

651
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,752
Not for real anyway.

652
00:48:05,877 --> 00:48:08,588
But anyone can act
if they have to.

653
00:48:08,922 --> 00:48:10,882
What do you mean anybody
can act if they...

654
00:48:11,090 --> 00:48:13,676
you can't act if you have to.
You gotta study that.

655
00:48:13,801 --> 00:48:16,721
A lot like..like when I got to South court.

656
00:48:18,598 --> 00:48:22,268
I figured that acting more psycho
than everyone else when I was younger.

657
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:24,646
Had to watch out for myself.

658
00:48:24,854 --> 00:48:26,731
So what did you do?

659
00:48:28,608 --> 00:48:31,110
I went at the ugliest guy I could find.

660
00:48:32,153 --> 00:48:34,239
I think I'm pissed off of you.
And I don't know why.

661
00:48:34,364 --> 00:48:35,782
Do I need a reason?

662
00:48:35,907 --> 00:48:37,575
You said that?
- Shut up! I'm talking to you.

663
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:39,786
Give me top ten reason you're a
piece of shit and I'll let you know...

664
00:48:39,953 --> 00:48:42,705
when something rings a bell,
but don't lie to me.

665
00:48:42,789 --> 00:48:45,708
And don't figure me as one of your
sissy boys, it's gonna pay out for you.

666
00:48:45,917 --> 00:48:48,127
You're sadly a deformed
excuse for humanity

667
00:48:48,211 --> 00:48:50,713
posing as a piece of prison garbage.

668
00:48:56,344 --> 00:48:57,804
And it worked.

669
00:49:00,098 --> 00:49:02,892
That was just...acting.

670
00:49:03,852 --> 00:49:05,937
Think about it, right.

671
00:49:08,022 --> 00:49:10,233
Hey, that was terrific.

672
00:49:29,294 --> 00:49:32,005
Hey, how are you doing?
I come here for the movie audition. - Back of the line.

673
00:50:55,630 --> 00:50:58,007
Do you know anything
about this movie here?

674
00:50:59,801 --> 00:51:01,761
It's for Scorsese and DeNiro.

675
00:51:03,012 --> 00:51:05,348
Where were you?
Funeral?

676
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:08,268
Yeah.

677
00:51:27,871 --> 00:51:29,289
Hey yourself.

678
00:51:34,544 --> 00:51:35,545
Yeah.

679
00:51:36,921 --> 00:51:38,381
Yeah what?

680
00:51:39,549 --> 00:51:40,884
Relax.

681
00:52:08,745 --> 00:52:09,662
Botero.

682
00:52:11,956 --> 00:52:14,459
Botero! Botero.

683
00:52:15,418 --> 00:52:16,836
It's Botero.

684
00:52:28,014 --> 00:52:31,768
Dude, it's Botero I wikipediad that.

685
00:52:31,976 --> 00:52:35,939
They got the pronunciation
spelled out like, at a dictionary.

686
00:52:37,190 --> 00:52:39,609
I'm making triple braised
baby back ribs...

687
00:52:39,692 --> 00:52:41,152
mix grilled.

688
00:52:41,569 --> 00:52:43,112
sweltered in steaks.

689
00:52:43,780 --> 00:52:45,865
Do you wanna go shopping with me?

690
00:52:54,374 --> 00:52:55,458
Yes.

691
00:52:58,378 --> 00:53:00,338
Yes, I do actually.

692
00:54:01,107 --> 00:54:04,152
Hey, I'm almost done with the thrash.

693
00:54:04,777 --> 00:54:06,237
What do you want me to do next?

694
00:54:06,446 --> 00:54:09,991
Oh I don't know.
What did Vince want done in there?

695
00:54:10,116 --> 00:54:15,288
A toilet, wall, shower stall,
I mean, he wasn't really specific.

696
00:54:16,789 --> 00:54:21,669
You know, we could go to a bathroom place or something.
Pick some stuff out.

697
00:54:23,546 --> 00:54:28,468
Well, I got no plans. I took a
day off, you know, "family time".

698
00:54:32,639 --> 00:54:37,310
Maybe we should ask
Vince if he has any...

699
00:54:38,561 --> 00:54:40,021
preferences.

700
00:54:41,064 --> 00:54:42,941
Preferences for what?

701
00:54:43,149 --> 00:54:45,568
Toilets and stuff?

702
00:54:47,946 --> 00:54:49,614
That's funny.

703
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:51,699
Why is that funny?

704
00:54:51,908 --> 00:54:53,660
You know, toilets...

705
00:54:54,410 --> 00:54:59,207
I just wanna go back to work.
And why does this holiday even exist?

706
00:55:00,583 --> 00:55:04,420
It's sucks, you know, my parents
were so freaking toxic. It's just...

707
00:55:08,925 --> 00:55:10,468
I gotta get out of here.

708
00:55:12,846 --> 00:55:15,348
I better call my husband.
- Sure.

709
00:55:20,478 --> 00:55:25,608
No way, no way,
no way, no way...

710
00:55:25,775 --> 00:55:27,986
No, no, no.

711
00:55:28,111 --> 00:55:31,197
No way, no.

712
00:55:36,536 --> 00:55:38,121
Officer Rizzo, please.

713
00:55:40,707 --> 00:55:43,418
Yeah, I'm holding for
my husband, Officer Rizzo.

714
00:55:45,295 --> 00:55:46,629
He called in sick?

715
00:55:56,890 --> 00:55:58,141
Hey sweetie, how are you doing?

716
00:55:58,224 --> 00:55:59,559
Where are you?

717
00:55:59,684 --> 00:56:01,352
Yeah, I'm a...

718
00:56:01,477 --> 00:56:04,480
I'm at work.
I'm on the yards.

719
00:56:09,152 --> 00:56:11,654
Well, I was just wondering...

720
00:56:12,488 --> 00:56:14,991
if you had a preference for toilets.

721
00:56:15,116 --> 00:56:16,367
Toilets?

722
00:56:17,744 --> 00:56:20,413
No preference.

723
00:56:20,538 --> 00:56:23,875
Take Tony with you
he could help.

724
00:56:26,169 --> 00:56:29,005
Yeah, okay. Good idea.
I'll take Tony.

725
00:56:44,020 --> 00:56:45,146
Oh, Vince...

726
00:56:45,980 --> 00:56:49,442
you know, how every cop
always leaves his house with a gun?

727
00:56:49,526 --> 00:56:51,277
Well, my husband swears...

728
00:56:51,402 --> 00:56:53,905
that every car should have
a good pair of handcuffs.

729
00:56:54,030 --> 00:56:56,199
Like he's Joe Justice.

730
00:56:59,536 --> 00:57:00,870
Orchard Beach.

731
00:57:00,995 --> 00:57:02,872
Have you ever been?

732
00:57:11,631 --> 00:57:13,383
I actually considered killing myself.

733
00:57:13,508 --> 00:57:18,513
I considered, you know,
chop off a sexual organ in defiance.

734
00:57:20,473 --> 00:57:23,518
I just gotta to tell you, though
it's my thing...

735
00:57:23,726 --> 00:57:28,106
I need to feed a girl
like a lot of food.

736
00:57:28,314 --> 00:57:29,983
You're a classic feeder, Vinnie.

737
00:57:30,066 --> 00:57:31,734
You gain pleasure by
giving pleasure.

738
00:57:35,613 --> 00:57:38,658
Who was the girl in the
park you were with yesterday?

739
00:57:41,327 --> 00:57:44,914
Oh, that's Sheryl,
she's just a friend from school.

740
00:57:44,998 --> 00:57:48,126
She's a sweet lady.
Try to love her.

741
00:57:56,676 --> 00:58:00,763
So Tony, you do anything else besides...

742
00:58:01,890 --> 00:58:03,433
Boosting a car?

743
00:58:05,643 --> 00:58:07,437
I also get stuff...

744
00:58:07,604 --> 00:58:09,606
all up at the gas station.

745
00:58:10,231 --> 00:58:13,860
Robbed a pharmacy,
couple of jewelry stores.

746
00:58:19,616 --> 00:58:21,910
Are you scared of me?

747
00:58:28,791 --> 00:58:29,626
Oh, yeah.

748
00:58:39,636 --> 00:58:41,721
Sir, follow us.
Sir, this way.

749
00:58:46,726 --> 00:58:49,979
Can you make a line
in the order I called you?

750
00:58:50,063 --> 00:58:51,940
And you, you join us.

751
00:58:52,065 --> 00:58:56,653
Sir, you too. You.
You in the back. This way.

752
00:58:58,488 --> 00:58:59,572
And him.

753
00:58:59,864 --> 00:59:02,075
And you, back of the line.

754
00:59:02,242 --> 00:59:04,244
Thank you very much.
Go home. Come on.

755
00:59:34,274 --> 00:59:37,193
It's okay Tony, it's not like
I'm doing this forever or nothing.

756
00:59:37,402 --> 00:59:40,029
I don't care.
It doesn't matter to me.

757
00:59:44,909 --> 00:59:47,829
Let me ask you if he
wasn't fooling around...

758
00:59:48,037 --> 00:59:52,417
No, no, you don't worry about that.
I mean, these decisions I make are mine.

759
00:59:52,625 --> 00:59:55,211
But I mean, what if he hadn't?

760
00:59:55,962 --> 00:59:56,713
Hadn't what?

761
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:58,882
Made what you thought he made.

762
00:59:59,090 --> 01:00:00,133
You're having another feeling.

763
01:00:00,341 --> 01:00:01,885
What other feeling?

764
01:00:04,095 --> 01:00:05,638
Like you don't like me?

765
01:00:05,763 --> 01:00:07,432
Definitely not the case.

766
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:09,934
Good.

767
01:00:14,105 --> 01:00:15,481
Vince Rizzo.

768
01:00:19,527 --> 01:00:20,778
Follow me.

769
01:00:30,580 --> 01:00:33,082
Relax yourself.

770
01:00:38,588 --> 01:00:40,506
Step on the mark.

771
01:00:44,344 --> 01:00:45,678
State yourself.

772
01:00:46,429 --> 01:00:47,180
Say what?

773
01:00:47,263 --> 01:00:49,349
Look into the camera
and say your name.

774
01:00:49,557 --> 01:00:53,186
Oh yeah, Vincent Rizzo
Correctional Officer 426.

775
01:00:59,567 --> 01:01:01,861
No, Joyce, I can't, I can't.

776
01:01:04,572 --> 01:01:06,533
It's not that I don't wanna, I do.

777
01:01:06,783 --> 01:01:08,743
It's not nothing.

778
01:01:08,952 --> 01:01:10,537
Except your husband...

779
01:01:10,620 --> 01:01:14,374
maybe he's got something going on
in his life, maybe it's not a poker game.

780
01:01:14,582 --> 01:01:17,710
but it's doesn't got to be
with another woman, you know.

781
01:01:18,545 --> 01:01:19,379
Really?

782
01:01:20,213 --> 01:01:23,550
Like what he's taking a class?
Please.

783
01:01:24,175 --> 01:01:25,426
Whenever you're ready.

784
01:01:25,635 --> 01:01:26,469
Excuse me?

785
01:01:26,886 --> 01:01:27,637
Start.

786
01:01:27,804 --> 01:01:29,389
Oh, do the thing.

787
01:01:43,653 --> 01:01:47,949
I'm sorry, are you doing
a Marlon Brando impression?

788
01:01:50,869 --> 01:01:51,703
No.

789
01:01:53,162 --> 01:01:56,291
Okay, let's just try again
in your own voice.

790
01:02:04,090 --> 01:02:08,094
So make no mistake Joey!
From now on out, I'm watching you.

791
01:02:08,386 --> 01:02:10,597
What you do, who you do.
Watch it!

792
01:02:10,763 --> 01:02:14,225
Coz Frankie Gunucci has
eyes in the back of his head.

793
01:02:14,434 --> 01:02:16,102
In the back of his head?

794
01:02:17,437 --> 01:02:19,939
In the back? Should it be like
I have eyes in the back...

795
01:02:20,190 --> 01:02:21,524
Thank you, Mr. Rizzo.

796
01:02:21,733 --> 01:02:23,401
Excuse me?
- Thank you.

797
01:02:24,027 --> 01:02:24,861
That's it?

798
01:02:29,949 --> 01:02:31,326
Hold on one second.

799
01:02:34,454 --> 01:02:35,622
Absolutely.

800
01:02:36,539 --> 01:02:37,707
Absolutely.

801
01:02:39,125 --> 01:02:40,084
I'll try.

802
01:02:42,170 --> 01:02:44,797
Are you a professional actor?

803
01:02:45,089 --> 01:02:47,300
No, I'm a correctional officer.

804
01:02:47,467 --> 01:02:50,303
Okay, could you come back?
Come back to the mark.

805
01:02:52,180 --> 01:02:55,517
You're a correctional officer.
Is that a prison guard?

806
01:02:55,725 --> 01:02:57,185
Prison guard?

807
01:02:58,144 --> 01:03:00,230
Yeah, I guess you can call it that.

808
01:03:00,730 --> 01:03:02,065
Okay, and where do you work?

809
01:03:02,398 --> 01:03:05,944
Dalegrove Correctional Facility, Westchester.

810
01:03:06,236 --> 01:03:09,697
Is that like one of those
Country Club prisons?

811
01:03:10,114 --> 01:03:13,451
Country Club prisons?
I'm sorry...

812
01:03:13,660 --> 01:03:16,788
...but I wouldn't call it that.
Not by a long shot.

813
01:03:17,205 --> 01:03:19,499
You want me to talk about this?
- Sure.

814
01:03:19,832 --> 01:03:22,418
We got guys in there that if
you see inside their minds

815
01:03:22,627 --> 01:03:25,672
and see what they're thinking,
you wouldn't be thinking of no golf game.

816
01:03:25,838 --> 01:03:28,675
Okay, well, tell me more about what you do?
What's a typical day?

817
01:03:28,883 --> 01:03:30,677
A typical day is no such animal.

818
01:03:30,844 --> 01:03:32,512
I mean, some days
I walk and talk, you know...

819
01:03:32,762 --> 01:03:35,139
you do the count.
You send the guys out in the yard.

820
01:03:35,348 --> 01:03:37,642
But other days.
Other days are trouble.

821
01:03:37,851 --> 01:03:40,687
The gangs are out of control,
you gotta lock down...

822
01:03:40,854 --> 01:03:43,273
The boys and the girls,
they go in a little dispatch.

823
01:03:43,481 --> 01:03:47,026
Kinda like the real world but
here, they jump your bones.

824
01:03:47,235 --> 01:03:50,864
And sometimes I see a new recruit come in
and I'm looking at him I'm going...

825
01:03:51,406 --> 01:03:53,700
"I got two words for you: Bye, bye."

826
01:03:53,908 --> 01:03:57,871
Coz you're not gonna be the same guy coming in
as you are going out, you know what I'm saying.

827
01:03:58,079 --> 01:04:03,084
Okay so, you know, that scene we just
read just do it again in your own words.

828
01:04:03,293 --> 01:04:04,460
Not using the...

829
01:04:04,627 --> 01:04:07,672
Throw the script away.
- Improvisation, it's like an improvisation.

830
01:04:08,631 --> 01:04:09,883
How would you say it?

831
01:04:10,049 --> 01:04:11,843
This Joey Zambuli character...

832
01:04:12,051 --> 01:04:14,554
he thinks he got the goods
on the Frankie Gunucci...

833
01:04:14,637 --> 01:04:16,431
which is the guy I play, right?

834
01:04:16,639 --> 01:04:18,933
Which makes Zambuli like the worst kind of creep.

835
01:04:19,142 --> 01:04:20,310
Why do you say that?

836
01:04:20,393 --> 01:04:23,104
Well, you know, where I work,
everything is about power.

837
01:04:25,064 --> 01:04:28,109
Zambuli they try to intimidate
the new recruits when they come in.

838
01:04:28,318 --> 01:04:31,029
And if you're a new recruit and
you don't get in their face right away

839
01:04:31,154 --> 01:04:33,656
and hold your ground, they're
gonna have you on all fours...

840
01:04:33,823 --> 01:04:37,577
...sucking cement.
You know what sucking cement means, right?

841
01:04:37,827 --> 01:04:39,162
I know what that means.

842
01:04:39,370 --> 01:04:42,498
What do you do with guys like that?

843
01:04:48,755 --> 01:04:51,591
What I would do is I would pretend that...

844
01:04:51,758 --> 01:04:53,843
Bang!, right up, right from the start
when they come to me...

845
01:04:54,093 --> 01:04:58,348
I pretend I'm more psycho than they are
you know, get them off guard.

846
01:04:58,556 --> 01:05:02,310
Look at this guy, get right in his face
and give him a little intimidation like that.

847
01:05:02,519 --> 01:05:08,691
And you say: "I'm pissed off of you,
and I don't know why. Do I got a reason?"

848
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:10,652
Something like that.

849
01:05:11,486 --> 01:05:15,448
Look right into the camera
and talk to Joey Zambuli.

850
01:05:15,657 --> 01:05:19,619
Like if Joey Zambuli is in the camera.
- Uh huh, and you are pissed off.

851
01:05:19,953 --> 01:05:21,704
I don't like him
- No.

852
01:05:21,913 --> 01:05:23,790
Yeah, I mean, he's a creep.

853
01:05:34,008 --> 01:05:39,013
Hey Zambuli, I think I'm pissed off of you
and I don't know why. Do I got a reason?

854
01:05:40,473 --> 01:05:42,225
Let me help you out a little bit.

855
01:05:42,475 --> 01:05:44,227
Why don't you give me your
Top Ten Reasons why you're...

856
01:05:44,310 --> 01:05:48,398
why you're a piece of shit.
And I'll tell you when one rings a bell.

857
01:05:48,606 --> 01:05:49,858
Okay, go.

858
01:05:50,149 --> 01:05:51,734
And don't lie to me!

859
01:05:52,902 --> 01:05:54,237
You got it? Don't lie to me.

860
01:05:54,445 --> 01:05:57,073
And don't figure me for
one of your little sissy boys.

861
01:05:57,240 --> 01:06:00,493
That's gonna put out for you.
Whenever you ask.

862
01:06:00,827 --> 01:06:04,873
Because I got eyes in the front of my head
and in the back of my head and in the side of my head.

863
01:06:05,081 --> 01:06:08,835
And they all see 20:20, capiche?
Comprende?

864
01:06:10,295 --> 01:06:14,174
You're a sadly deformed excuse
for humanity...

865
01:06:14,340 --> 01:06:17,177
posing as some sort of prison garbage.

866
01:06:19,262 --> 01:06:21,264
You mess with me...

867
01:06:21,764 --> 01:06:25,435
You mess with Frankie Gunucci!
Frankie Gunucci! You lose!

868
01:06:25,602 --> 01:06:26,561
Thank you.

869
01:06:26,853 --> 01:06:27,812
What?

870
01:06:28,021 --> 01:06:28,771
Thank you.

871
01:06:28,938 --> 01:06:31,149
Yeah, you better thank me,
you piece of shit, get out of my face!

872
01:06:31,357 --> 01:06:33,443
Get out of my face!

873
01:06:33,651 --> 01:06:35,320
Yeah, take your eyes out
of your fucking head.

874
01:06:35,528 --> 01:06:36,571
Thank you, Mr. Rizzo.
- Shove it up your nose you're gonna be looking like this...

875
01:06:38,031 --> 01:06:40,450
Mr. Rizzo, thank you.
- the rest of your life.

876
01:06:40,950 --> 01:06:43,661
Excuse me?
Oh, that's all?

877
01:06:43,870 --> 01:06:47,415
Sorry, I got carried away.
- That's okay.

878
01:06:47,540 --> 01:06:50,210
Thank you, that was crazy.
Pretty wild.

879
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:51,711
You need this?

880
01:06:51,794 --> 01:06:54,214
No that's fine, you can keep it.
- Thank you very much.

881
01:06:55,548 --> 01:06:57,717
That's nice. I had a good time.

882
01:07:00,637 --> 01:07:03,264
I was walking out I was feeling
like I was gonna throw up.

883
01:07:03,473 --> 01:07:05,350
and then she stopped me,
she brought me back in.

884
01:07:05,558 --> 01:07:07,644
And before I knew it,
she's asking me these questions...

885
01:07:07,852 --> 01:07:11,606
she's got me doing an improvisation
and I lost my mind.

886
01:07:11,731 --> 01:07:13,274
It was crazy.

887
01:07:13,816 --> 01:07:14,943
Wait.

888
01:07:15,485 --> 01:07:19,113
You just did an improve for
Martin Scorsese's casting director.

889
01:07:19,531 --> 01:07:22,659
Vincent, that's not everyday
garden variety audition. That's...

890
01:07:22,742 --> 01:07:28,915
I mean, that's just...
You're in a... elite...

891
01:07:29,749 --> 01:07:32,752
elite core of auditionists.

892
01:07:33,086 --> 01:07:35,588
No, I wouldn't call that elite.
- It's amazing.

893
01:07:36,756 --> 01:07:39,133
It was wild.

894
01:07:39,425 --> 01:07:43,847
I mean, she had me screaming
inside the camera and I lost my mind.

895
01:07:45,390 --> 01:07:47,892
But all to me,
it was all bullshit.

896
01:07:48,017 --> 01:07:49,352
What do you mean?

897
01:07:49,435 --> 01:07:53,189
Well, because I pretended as though I, you know,
that's the way I talk to the guys inside.

898
01:07:53,314 --> 01:07:56,025
but actually that's the way my son,
Tony, talks to the guys inside.

899
01:07:56,234 --> 01:07:58,736
No, that's so much better.

900
01:07:58,945 --> 01:08:03,741
You corrupted someone else's experience
and filtered it in to your own personality...

901
01:08:03,867 --> 01:08:06,244
in order to create a character.
That's not bullshit, Vincent.

902
01:08:06,369 --> 01:08:07,787
That's acting.

903
01:08:07,912 --> 01:08:09,789
That's acting.
You could do that in acting.

904
01:08:09,873 --> 01:08:11,666
Yes.
- It's allowed?

905
01:08:11,791 --> 01:08:14,294
I can't believe this has
happened to you today.

906
01:08:14,377 --> 01:08:16,796
It was real pretty crazy,
I tell you. I kind of...

907
01:08:19,799 --> 01:08:20,842
Yeah, this is me.

908
01:08:22,093 --> 01:08:24,721
You want me to come back?
Did I forget something?

909
01:08:24,804 --> 01:08:26,472
Who's this?

910
01:08:26,973 --> 01:08:29,601
Louise from casting?

911
01:08:29,809 --> 01:08:31,811
The producers would like
to see you reading again...

912
01:08:31,895 --> 01:08:34,397
with some of the other actors
who've already been cast.

913
01:08:34,480 --> 01:08:38,067
This would be, Wednesday at 2.
Can you make it?

914
01:08:38,484 --> 01:08:40,862
Read with other actors?

915
01:08:41,154 --> 01:08:43,907
Yes, yes, I guess yes.

916
01:08:43,990 --> 01:08:46,826
I mean, Wednesday at 2.
I got work on Wednesday.

917
01:08:47,535 --> 01:08:51,164
No, I don't have work on
Wednesday, Wednesday at 2?

918
01:08:51,289 --> 01:08:54,000
It's okay, yeah, that'll be fine.
I can be there, yeah.

919
01:08:54,083 --> 01:08:56,169
Thank you for everything, I guess.

920
01:09:00,173 --> 01:09:02,342
You gotta go back.

921
01:09:02,759 --> 01:09:04,010
Yeah, I guess so.

922
01:09:04,219 --> 01:09:05,887
Vincent...
- Yeah.

923
01:09:07,013 --> 01:09:11,017
First time out, God!
- Yeah, beginner's luck.

924
01:09:23,112 --> 01:09:24,239
What's wrong?

925
01:09:24,364 --> 01:09:26,533
Come on,
what's going on?

926
01:09:27,992 --> 01:09:28,826
What?

927
01:09:28,952 --> 01:09:32,872
No, it's super brilliant.
It's amazing.

928
01:09:35,708 --> 01:09:38,002
You know, well, it's
all meant to be somehow

929
01:09:38,127 --> 01:09:41,548
you know we meet, to have coffee
and tell each other secrets.

930
01:09:41,631 --> 01:09:45,510
And for me to show you
an advert in screen stage...

931
01:09:45,635 --> 01:09:47,387
that launches your career.

932
01:09:47,470 --> 01:09:49,889
Yeah, I know no careers being launched yet.

933
01:09:50,390 --> 01:09:54,811
You know, I'm just going back in
and I haven't even got the part yet.

934
01:09:54,894 --> 01:09:57,480
You can't believe how amazing this is.

935
01:09:59,566 --> 01:10:01,484
Excuse me, everybody.

936
01:10:01,901 --> 01:10:03,862
I'm sorry to bother you but
I just want to tell you for a second...

937
01:10:04,070 --> 01:10:07,198
about my dear friend here, Vincent Rizzo.

938
01:10:07,615 --> 01:10:09,576
Went on his very first audition today.

939
01:10:09,701 --> 01:10:11,578
For a Martin Scorsese film.

940
01:10:11,786 --> 01:10:14,414
And they liked him so much...

941
01:10:14,497 --> 01:10:18,042
that they've called him back on Wednesday.

942
01:10:18,877 --> 01:10:21,379
And he's a prison guard.

943
01:10:43,193 --> 01:10:44,319
Joyce.

944
01:10:48,907 --> 01:10:50,783
I had a great time.

945
01:11:09,886 --> 01:11:12,055
So Vincent, tell me something...

946
01:11:12,138 --> 01:11:13,806
What're you gonna tell your wife?

947
01:11:13,932 --> 01:11:19,771
She doesn't gonna have any idea that you
even have the tiniest little inkling of acting ambition at all.

948
01:11:20,188 --> 01:11:23,525
No, she still knows nothing.
She still thinks a got a poker game, that's it.

949
01:11:23,650 --> 01:11:26,152
And even if I will to tell her.
She would never believe that.

950
01:11:26,236 --> 01:11:31,032
I mean, I have to start like, go so far back
to try to even explain when it happened...

951
01:11:31,241 --> 01:11:34,369
and how it happened and
where are the Brando thing.

952
01:11:34,494 --> 01:11:37,413
And I mean, no matter what I say,
I don't even know where to start.

953
01:11:37,497 --> 01:11:40,083
What about that the truth
is not outside of the question, is it?

954
01:11:40,208 --> 01:11:41,334
It's out of the question.

955
01:11:56,891 --> 01:11:59,185
Can I have some chicken, please.
- Chicken, right.

956
01:12:00,770 --> 01:12:02,730
Mind if my hands...

957
01:12:04,274 --> 01:12:06,484
You okay honey, you need anything else?
- No, I'm good.

958
01:12:08,695 --> 01:12:10,446
Okay, I think I got it.

959
01:12:11,072 --> 01:12:14,826
What if you pretend
to be my manager?

960
01:12:15,118 --> 01:12:17,537
And then you could say
you then discovered me.

961
01:12:17,620 --> 01:12:20,248
Nice. I like it.
- Thank you very much.

962
01:12:20,373 --> 01:12:23,585
Yes, I discovered you
in some sort of a strange way.

963
01:12:23,710 --> 01:12:28,381
Like my brother's an inmate or something.
- Nice.

964
01:12:35,054 --> 01:12:38,391
And I set you up with Martin Scorsese's
casting. It's perfect.

965
01:12:38,808 --> 01:12:42,770
If she has any problems your wife
can come to me about them.

966
01:12:42,896 --> 01:12:45,773
And you're okay with that?
Because, you know, she can be kind of a hurricane.

967
01:12:45,899 --> 01:12:48,610
Wives always hate me Vincent
I'm used to it.

968
01:12:50,278 --> 01:12:51,821
Are you ready?

969
01:12:52,238 --> 01:12:53,907
To go to City Island?
- Now?

970
01:13:11,257 --> 01:13:13,343
So this is it?
- Yeah.

971
01:13:13,635 --> 01:13:15,929
I like it.
- Yeah, it's nice.

972
01:13:16,262 --> 01:13:20,016
It's kinda like New England
by way of Washington Heights.

973
01:13:39,077 --> 01:13:41,287
City Island Yacht and Beach Club?

974
01:13:41,371 --> 01:13:43,456
Well, it's more like a boat yard.

975
01:13:43,581 --> 01:13:46,876
It's got some grass and barbecues and...

976
01:13:47,293 --> 01:13:48,670
...it's got a pier. But the views are great.

977
01:13:53,675 --> 01:13:56,594
Can we see the views for
like just a minute?

978
01:13:57,011 --> 01:13:58,888
Yeah, I don't see why not?

979
01:13:59,222 --> 01:13:59,931
Excellent.

980
01:14:28,918 --> 01:14:32,046
Every busy city needs
an island of peace.

981
01:14:32,672 --> 01:14:35,925
And every busy soul needs
a place to propose.

982
01:14:39,888 --> 01:14:42,348
Tell it to me again.
- What?

983
01:14:43,183 --> 01:14:46,019
Your big secret.
- About Tony?

984
01:14:46,853 --> 01:14:49,147
You already know the whole thing.

985
01:14:49,772 --> 01:14:52,483
You're the only one who does know.

986
01:14:53,443 --> 01:14:57,488
Yeah, I know, but how did it work?
How did you?...His mom and...

987
01:14:59,240 --> 01:15:01,784
When did you know you were leaving?

988
01:15:02,702 --> 01:15:05,288
Well, I met Nen when
I was about 19.

989
01:15:05,413 --> 01:15:07,373
And she was older.

990
01:15:07,498 --> 01:15:11,878
And she was kinda hot for me and
I was hot to get out of the family.

991
01:15:12,086 --> 01:15:14,589
You know, get away from City Island.

992
01:15:14,714 --> 01:15:17,300
We used to drink at the same
bottle of wine in Arthur Avenue.

993
01:15:17,509 --> 01:15:21,262
Pretty soon, I started
living at her place.

994
01:15:21,471 --> 01:15:23,890
And then that's when things
got a little complicated.

995
01:15:40,865 --> 01:15:43,368
Next you know she was pregnant.

996
01:15:43,660 --> 01:15:46,287
I knew by then she
was bad news for me so...

997
01:15:48,081 --> 01:15:50,583
She said: "I knew you're leaving anyway."

998
01:15:50,792 --> 01:15:53,253
"I'm not gonna get stuck
with nothing for myself" so...

999
01:15:54,087 --> 01:15:55,880
That's when I know
she was having a kid.

1000
01:15:56,005 --> 01:15:57,757
And I had to do what I have to do.

1001
01:15:57,966 --> 01:16:01,219
Or what I thought I had to do.
I was also a kid.

1002
01:16:01,511 --> 01:16:04,514
Anyway, I had 7500 bucks
in my pocket and I, you know...

1003
01:16:04,639 --> 01:16:07,684
working on my father's boat
here in City Island.

1004
01:16:07,976 --> 01:16:10,144
I was gonna use it to
go to City College...

1005
01:16:10,270 --> 01:16:12,146
...but I gave it to her instead.

1006
01:16:12,230 --> 01:16:14,524
And then you know,
I got into this prison stuff.

1007
01:16:14,649 --> 01:16:18,611
I figured I need a steady income,
pension, I met Joyce...

1008
01:16:18,695 --> 01:16:21,197
You never told anyone in your family?

1009
01:16:21,322 --> 01:16:25,910
I don't wanna bother anybody.
It was my thing.

1010
01:16:27,871 --> 01:16:31,124
Plus, I wasn't too proud of taking off.

1011
01:16:31,457 --> 01:16:34,377
Leaving is never pretty
no matter how you do it.

1012
01:16:35,378 --> 01:16:37,172
Yeah, you can say that again.

1013
01:16:53,646 --> 01:16:54,564
Bitch!

1014
01:16:58,026 --> 01:16:59,694
There was no one there.

1015
01:16:59,819 --> 01:17:02,280
I hate those things.
Won't you hate those things?

1016
01:17:02,405 --> 01:17:04,699
I'm always getting a wrong number.

1017
01:17:05,325 --> 01:17:07,744
No, it wasn't a wrong number.

1018
01:17:09,579 --> 01:17:11,789
It was an announcement.

1019
01:17:16,294 --> 01:17:18,379
A ring a bell.

1020
01:17:19,422 --> 01:17:21,049
An indication.

1021
01:17:22,217 --> 01:17:23,343
For what?

1022
01:17:32,519 --> 01:17:34,312
Now, Vincent.

1023
01:17:37,524 --> 01:17:39,526
Now is the time.

1024
01:17:42,362 --> 01:17:44,322
Have you still got it?

1025
01:17:45,365 --> 01:17:47,242
What? Your secret?

1026
01:17:48,701 --> 01:17:49,953
Yeah, of course.

1027
01:17:50,161 --> 01:17:51,621
Sure?

1028
01:17:52,455 --> 01:17:53,373
No.

1029
01:17:55,041 --> 01:17:56,000
Yes.

1030
01:18:10,723 --> 01:18:12,267
Who are they?

1031
01:18:14,894 --> 01:18:16,646
My three secrets.

1032
01:18:28,950 --> 01:18:30,743
They're beautiful.

1033
01:18:31,035 --> 01:18:32,161
Thank you.

1034
01:18:32,495 --> 01:18:33,830
Where are they?

1035
01:18:33,955 --> 01:18:36,332
With my husband in Schenectady.

1036
01:18:37,292 --> 01:18:39,169
What are they doing up there?

1037
01:18:39,377 --> 01:18:42,505
Real question is,
what am I doing down here?

1038
01:18:43,548 --> 01:18:45,633
That's where I'm from, Vincent.

1039
01:18:47,719 --> 01:18:49,596
Born and raised.

1040
01:18:50,346 --> 01:18:52,515
My father was the janitor
at the grade school...

1041
01:18:52,724 --> 01:18:55,351
...and my mother left
home when I was 6.

1042
01:18:57,103 --> 01:19:00,023
And their mother left
5 months ago.

1043
01:19:02,025 --> 01:19:03,151
Why?

1044
01:19:14,120 --> 01:19:18,291
To see if it was possible to
pretend the past never existed.

1045
01:19:19,834 --> 01:19:21,794
It's not possible.

1046
01:19:29,844 --> 01:19:32,222
Please, don't hate me, Vincent.

1047
01:19:35,266 --> 01:19:38,394
If anyone might understand,
it would be you.

1048
01:20:25,108 --> 01:20:29,195
What's up? Seltzer water?
- Seltzer water, please. Seltzer water.

1049
01:21:35,094 --> 01:21:37,055
What the hell are you doing here?

1050
01:21:37,180 --> 01:21:38,932
Yeah, well, I guess I can
ask you the same question.

1051
01:21:39,057 --> 01:21:40,266
Does my mother know
that you have her car?

1052
01:21:40,391 --> 01:21:41,935
Does your mother know
that you're a stripper?

1053
01:21:42,060 --> 01:21:43,728
Give me the key.

1054
01:21:44,020 --> 01:21:46,856
Listen, I'm not trying to make any...
- Let me have the key.

1055
01:21:47,899 --> 01:21:50,193
You don't have it, do you?

1056
01:21:50,527 --> 01:21:53,112
You stole my mother's car, didn't you?

1057
01:21:53,446 --> 01:21:54,781
You're such a loser.

1058
01:21:55,198 --> 01:21:58,117
Hi, yeah, I like to report a stolen car.

1059
01:21:58,743 --> 01:22:00,411
Yeah, I'll hold.

1060
01:22:01,120 --> 01:22:03,122
Why are you even here, huh?

1061
01:22:07,919 --> 01:22:10,713
Yeah, hi, my mother's car was stolen.

1062
01:22:10,839 --> 01:22:13,216
Yeah, license plate number, hold on...

1063
01:22:22,517 --> 01:22:24,394
Give me that.
- Calm down!

1064
01:22:24,602 --> 01:22:26,479
You stole my mother's car.
- And you're a stripper.

1065
01:22:26,688 --> 01:22:29,315
Stripping isn't against the law.
- Oh, then it's okay for me to tell your parents of what you do.

1066
01:22:29,399 --> 01:22:30,859
No, don't you dare, you loser!

1067
01:22:30,984 --> 01:22:32,402
Bitch. Hooker!

1068
01:22:32,527 --> 01:22:33,987
Don't call me that!
I'm not a hooker!

1069
01:22:34,195 --> 01:22:36,281
Showing your tits for money,
what's that called, librarian?

1070
01:22:36,406 --> 01:22:39,534
I got suspended from school, alright
and I lost my scholarship.

1071
01:22:39,742 --> 01:22:41,411
It's just so I could
make enough money

1072
01:22:41,494 --> 01:22:43,788
so I could go back and have to tell my parents.

1073
01:22:43,913 --> 01:22:45,874
And I'm the loser, huh?

1074
01:22:51,421 --> 01:22:53,381
Come here. Come here.
- Get off. What are you doing?

1075
01:22:53,506 --> 01:22:56,301
I'm bringing your mom's car back
with you in it, you know, I really delivered.

1076
01:22:56,426 --> 01:22:58,511
And only you know, I took it.
And only I know you work here.

1077
01:22:58,595 --> 01:23:01,431
And that's gonna be the deal with us forever
until one of us blows it. That's how it works for us, Vivian?

1078
01:23:01,514 --> 01:23:03,516
That's how it's gonna work for you and me.
Got it, Vivian?

1079
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:04,767
Take these off!

1080
01:23:06,519 --> 01:23:07,979
Why did my father
even bring you home?

1081
01:23:08,104 --> 01:23:09,939
I have no idea.

1082
01:23:12,025 --> 01:23:15,695
Did something happen between you and my mom?
- No.

1083
01:23:16,613 --> 01:23:17,989
Are you gonna tell them that...?

1084
01:23:18,114 --> 01:23:20,074
Hey, I gave you my word, didn't I?
My word's my word.

1085
01:23:20,200 --> 01:23:23,828
Which something you and your jerk off family
probably never even heard off.

1086
01:23:34,797 --> 01:23:37,383
That's weird.
- What's wrong?

1087
01:23:37,467 --> 01:23:40,512
She's not home.
Maybe she went out for some food.

1088
01:23:49,479 --> 01:23:51,898
This is so nice.

1089
01:23:51,981 --> 01:23:55,193
Yeah, my grandfather built this house.
He's a builder.

1090
01:23:57,403 --> 01:24:01,991
Yeah, so, here's what I'm thinking.
Now, when she comes in.

1091
01:24:02,075 --> 01:24:04,911
I'm just gonna say straight up,
I'll just look at her and say:

1092
01:24:05,119 --> 01:24:08,665
"Joyce, it's time we gotta talk."

1093
01:24:09,499 --> 01:24:12,335
Vincent, darling.
That's the wrong way.

1094
01:24:12,418 --> 01:24:15,004
Women, they feel...

1095
01:24:15,672 --> 01:24:18,258
challenged by too much honesty.

1096
01:24:18,466 --> 01:24:20,134
No, you gotta trust me on this.

1097
01:24:20,343 --> 01:24:22,762
After 20 years with her,
I know what I'm talking about.

1098
01:24:22,929 --> 01:24:23,888
Vincent.
- Why?

1099
01:24:24,097 --> 01:24:28,059
Darling, 30 years I've been
a woman. Let me handle her.

1100
01:24:28,184 --> 01:24:31,688
Remain casual and don't mention
about anything unusual going on.

1101
01:24:31,813 --> 01:24:34,524
Before she can even think and ask
what I'm doing here...

1102
01:24:34,732 --> 01:24:38,069
she'll be thanking me.
For having come into your life.

1103
01:24:41,531 --> 01:24:43,700
Hey, how are you doing?
You're home.

1104
01:24:43,908 --> 01:24:46,828
Yeah, Vince, I'm home.

1105
01:24:48,079 --> 01:24:49,330
Where I live.

1106
01:24:49,414 --> 01:24:50,915
Yeah, where you live.

1107
01:24:51,124 --> 01:24:54,127
Who's this?
- Who's this?

1108
01:24:57,255 --> 01:25:00,800
I'm Molly Charlsworth.
It's such a pleasure.

1109
01:25:01,634 --> 01:25:04,137
Yeah, Molly wants, see...

1110
01:25:04,345 --> 01:25:06,973
Molly here and I we got some...

1111
01:25:08,391 --> 01:25:10,810
we got something we wanna tell you.

1112
01:25:11,019 --> 01:25:12,478
Something we want...
Go ahead, tell her.

1113
01:25:12,687 --> 01:25:14,772
Well, I have something
I wanna say too, Vince.

1114
01:25:14,981 --> 01:25:18,401
Yeah, but, we gotta tell you here
something that's very important.

1115
01:25:18,526 --> 01:25:22,197
Really? Coz what I gotta say
is pretty important too.

1116
01:25:22,280 --> 01:25:25,825
Yeah. But is it more important or
less important than what I gotta tell you?

1117
01:25:25,909 --> 01:25:30,538
Well, I don't know Vince,
I don't know what it is you gotta tell me.

1118
01:25:30,622 --> 01:25:33,124
May I just...
- Not a word, bitch.

1119
01:25:35,210 --> 01:25:36,878
Hey, Joyce, you don't have to talk...

1120
01:25:37,086 --> 01:25:39,172
Freak!
- Freak?

1121
01:25:39,255 --> 01:25:43,760
You bring her into my home.
Into my own house...

1122
01:25:43,968 --> 01:25:47,514
where I raised your 2 children.

1123
01:25:47,722 --> 01:25:49,682
You bring this...

1124
01:25:49,891 --> 01:25:51,684
this thing of yours.

1125
01:25:51,976 --> 01:25:53,853
Let me tell you something, Vince.

1126
01:25:54,521 --> 01:25:56,898
I'm gonna do you a big favor.
- What?

1127
01:25:57,023 --> 01:25:59,609
I'm gonna put both of you
out of your misery.

1128
01:25:59,734 --> 01:26:03,154
I would not be insulted
in my own home.

1129
01:26:03,279 --> 01:26:06,199
I want you gone, Vince.
Out of my life.

1130
01:26:06,282 --> 01:26:08,451
No more wandering around behind my back.

1131
01:26:08,660 --> 01:26:11,079
No more dirty cheap little lies.

1132
01:26:11,204 --> 01:26:12,539
No more lying in bed...

1133
01:26:12,622 --> 01:26:15,458
wondering who else has been touching my husband.

1134
01:26:15,667 --> 01:26:19,629
No more lying to myself
that it doesn't matter.

1135
01:26:21,714 --> 01:26:23,800
I found passion today, Vince.

1136
01:26:23,883 --> 01:26:25,468
It felt great.

1137
01:26:25,677 --> 01:26:28,930
I was touched and kissed...

1138
01:26:29,138 --> 01:26:30,557
...and held.

1139
01:26:33,393 --> 01:26:37,063
And I felt like you haven't
made me feel in years.

1140
01:26:37,480 --> 01:26:39,941
What are you talking about here?

1141
01:26:40,066 --> 01:26:42,360
I'm talking about Tony.

1142
01:26:43,611 --> 01:26:45,989
Tony? You did something with Tony?

1143
01:26:46,197 --> 01:26:48,908
I did more than something with Tony.

1144
01:26:57,083 --> 01:26:58,501
Dear...

1145
01:26:59,669 --> 01:27:02,297
...great in script.

1146
01:27:24,485 --> 01:27:26,988
Vince, get the key,
the key, I need it now.

1147
01:27:34,078 --> 01:27:35,538
Me and you, we're gonna go
for a walk right now.

1148
01:27:35,747 --> 01:27:37,957
It's not what you think. Just relax.

1149
01:27:38,124 --> 01:27:39,626
Settle down.

1150
01:27:39,834 --> 01:27:41,586
A little walk and a long talk.

1151
01:27:41,711 --> 01:27:44,714
Put down the knife, alright?
- Stay right there.

1152
01:27:46,174 --> 01:27:48,760
What're you wearing over there?
What's that you're wearing?

1153
01:27:52,222 --> 01:27:53,056
Vince!

1154
01:27:54,224 --> 01:27:57,727
Yeah, you better run,
you son of a bitch, I'm gonna kill you!

1155
01:27:58,061 --> 01:27:58,978
Dad?

1156
01:28:01,064 --> 01:28:05,360
Where are you going? You piece of shit!
You're a piece of shit...

1157
01:28:05,568 --> 01:28:08,279
...who screwed my wife and screwed my daughter.

1158
01:28:08,488 --> 01:28:10,240
And who's next? Who's next, my son?

1159
01:28:10,490 --> 01:28:12,033
Hey, didn't screw nobody, alright.

1160
01:28:12,158 --> 01:28:13,284
He didn't screw nobody.

1161
01:28:13,493 --> 01:28:15,787
Vince, you're making a big mistake.
Put down the knife, alright.

1162
01:28:15,995 --> 01:28:17,872
He's defending you.

1163
01:28:18,081 --> 01:28:19,123
Put down the...

1164
01:28:19,332 --> 01:28:21,918
He's defending you.
- Just put down the knife!

1165
01:28:25,171 --> 01:28:27,257
Oh, dad, totally lame.

1166
01:28:27,340 --> 01:28:30,176
There's no more knife, alright.
- Okay, no more knife.

1167
01:28:30,385 --> 01:28:31,845
Peace, okay.

1168
01:28:32,053 --> 01:28:34,973
I don't know what you think
happened here but peace okay...

1169
01:28:35,181 --> 01:28:37,475
and we can talk.
- Okay, I'm sorry.

1170
01:28:39,561 --> 01:28:41,354
Leave him alone, Vince.

1171
01:28:44,566 --> 01:28:45,191
Rough.

1172
01:28:45,400 --> 01:28:47,485
Vince, stop it!

1173
01:28:47,777 --> 01:28:51,948
Stop it, Vince!
He didn't do nothing.

1174
01:28:52,365 --> 01:28:55,410
Hey, get off. Get out of here. Do nothing?
What about all that passion?

1175
01:28:55,410 --> 01:28:57,078
And all that crap you're talking about...

1176
01:28:57,287 --> 01:28:59,873
Yeah, what about yours?

1177
01:28:59,998 --> 01:29:01,749
Your Molly Ringworth over there.

1178
01:29:01,875 --> 01:29:04,294
Who I'm supposed to thank
for being in your life.

1179
01:29:04,460 --> 01:29:06,462
You bring your filthy girlfriend
into my house.

1180
01:29:06,546 --> 01:29:07,922
She's not my girlfriend!

1181
01:29:08,006 --> 01:29:10,008
I'm his manager.

1182
01:29:11,885 --> 01:29:12,635
Your what?

1183
01:29:12,719 --> 01:29:15,013
My manager for the Scorsese
and DeNiro movie.

1184
01:29:15,221 --> 01:29:16,264
What DeNiro movie?

1185
01:29:16,472 --> 01:29:20,310
I'm gonna be in a Robert DeNiro
movie with Martin Scorsese.

1186
01:29:20,435 --> 01:29:22,103
Your dad's an actor?

1187
01:29:22,312 --> 01:29:24,606
No, liar, he's a liar.

1188
01:29:24,814 --> 01:29:26,983
Oh, what kind of bullshit is that?

1189
01:29:27,233 --> 01:29:28,985
Actually, he hasn't been signed yet...

1190
01:29:29,194 --> 01:29:31,696
but he auditioned today and
apparently make quite an impression.

1191
01:29:31,821 --> 01:29:33,031
They called him back.

1192
01:29:33,156 --> 01:29:34,741
You went on a movie audition today.

1193
01:29:34,824 --> 01:29:36,618
That's right. That's what I've
been trying to tell you.

1194
01:29:36,701 --> 01:29:38,912
And Molly here she is a friend of mine...

1195
01:29:38,995 --> 01:29:42,665
a "friend". "Friend".
And we go to an acting class together.

1196
01:29:42,749 --> 01:29:45,460
And she's the one who told
me to go on the audition today.

1197
01:29:45,543 --> 01:29:47,420
And that's why I'm  here.
And that's what's happening.

1198
01:29:47,629 --> 01:29:50,340
What acting class?
When do you take an acting class?

1199
01:29:50,465 --> 01:29:52,967
When I play poker!

1200
01:29:54,636 --> 01:29:57,138
It's the truth, you see...

1201
01:29:57,347 --> 01:29:58,681
Vincent didn't tell because...

1202
01:29:58,932 --> 01:30:02,143
he has feelings of shame
and inferiority about his ambition.

1203
01:30:02,227 --> 01:30:04,020
Hey, don't go that far.

1204
01:30:04,103 --> 01:30:05,480
Oh, I don't believe you.

1205
01:30:05,605 --> 01:30:07,774
What? You know what,
I don't give a shit if you don't believe me.

1206
01:30:07,982 --> 01:30:09,776
In fact, I don't give a shit
if you don't believe me...

1207
01:30:09,859 --> 01:30:12,070
because you got a few things
to answer for yourself.

1208
01:30:12,153 --> 01:30:15,907
Like what's going on over here?
What? What?

1209
01:30:16,115 --> 01:30:17,575
Are you leaving me for her?

1210
01:30:17,700 --> 01:30:19,536
Oh come on, mom.
Dad couldn't get her.

1211
01:30:19,786 --> 01:30:22,580
Hey, little girl, I think you better shut
your mouth and mind your own business.

1212
01:30:22,705 --> 01:30:27,460
Anyway, what are you doing handcuffed
to that animal over there in that robe?

1213
01:30:28,211 --> 01:30:30,088
Tell him.

1214
01:30:30,380 --> 01:30:32,173
Yeah, tell him.

1215
01:30:34,884 --> 01:30:36,469
I was back at school...

1216
01:30:36,553 --> 01:30:40,098
Oh my God! Just tell him
the truth. You're all so sick.

1217
01:30:43,017 --> 01:30:45,103
I stole your car.
- You stole the car?

1218
01:30:45,228 --> 01:30:49,482
I boosted your goddamn car so I could
take off and get away from all your crap.

1219
01:30:49,607 --> 01:30:52,610
What is that gotta do with her?
The young one over there.

1220
01:30:52,902 --> 01:30:53,987
Go ahead.

1221
01:30:55,113 --> 01:30:56,656
Yeah, go ahead.

1222
01:30:57,824 --> 01:30:59,701
I'm a stripper.

1223
01:31:01,077 --> 01:31:01,995
A what?

1224
01:31:02,912 --> 01:31:05,248
What about those two things?

1225
01:31:05,331 --> 01:31:07,917
I paid for them myself, alright.

1226
01:31:12,630 --> 01:31:15,550
You go to college, you're in a school,
you got that scholarship.

1227
01:31:15,758 --> 01:31:17,010
They took it away, okay.

1228
01:31:17,218 --> 01:31:20,763
I can go back next semester but
I gotta pay for it myself.

1229
01:31:20,972 --> 01:31:22,223
And I'm gonna.

1230
01:31:22,432 --> 01:31:24,517
Why did they take your scholarship away?

1231
01:31:24,726 --> 01:31:27,645
Because I screwed up, okay,
Mom, I screwed up. Me.

1232
01:31:27,770 --> 01:31:29,522
And I got caught...

1233
01:31:29,731 --> 01:31:32,233
I got caught with pot in my room.

1234
01:31:32,358 --> 01:31:33,484
You smoked pot?

1235
01:31:33,610 --> 01:31:35,778
Yes, I smoked pot.

1236
01:31:36,196 --> 01:31:38,781
God, it's such a stupid word, pot.

1237
01:31:39,866 --> 01:31:41,826
They took away your scholarship...

1238
01:31:41,951 --> 01:31:46,706
and kicked you out of school
because of a little pot?

1239
01:31:46,956 --> 01:31:49,459
Oh sweetie, honey everyone smokes pot.

1240
01:31:49,542 --> 01:31:54,214
Okay, wait a second with the lovey dovey
thing here, we got a lot of things to settle.

1241
01:31:55,465 --> 01:31:59,219
You've stolen my car, you know I can
have you locked up in 10 minutes for that.

1242
01:31:59,344 --> 01:32:02,472
Fine, do it. At least
everyones honest.

1243
01:32:02,680 --> 01:32:04,891
You're so scared of your wife you
won't even smoke in front of her.

1244
01:32:04,974 --> 01:32:06,434
Vince? You're smoking.

1245
01:32:06,559 --> 01:32:07,393
No, no, I quit.

1246
01:32:07,477 --> 01:32:09,979
Liar. And you got your wife
thinking you got a girlfriend...

1247
01:32:10,188 --> 01:32:14,067
coz you're too scared to tell her
you wanna take an acting class.

1248
01:32:14,150 --> 01:32:16,986
This whole time, you got
this weird agenda with me

1249
01:32:17,153 --> 01:32:18,821
and you won't even tell me what it is.

1250
01:32:18,947 --> 01:32:21,324
Why did you get me out of jail, Vince?

1251
01:32:21,574 --> 01:32:24,577
Why did you bring me here?
- I told you I was a friend of your mother.

1252
01:32:24,786 --> 01:32:28,122
My mother never had a friend so
good they'd do me a right turn.

1253
01:32:28,248 --> 01:32:30,625
Everyone hated her.
She was a drunk and a whore.

1254
01:32:30,750 --> 01:32:33,127
And she got you to get me out of jail.
I don't know what the hell I'm gonna think...

1255
01:32:33,336 --> 01:32:36,047
Whatever I did, I did on my own.
Nobody puts me up to anything.

1256
01:32:36,172 --> 01:32:40,093
Your mother was a
goddamn psycho bitch.

1257
01:32:40,343 --> 01:32:43,680
And that's why I walked out of
her before you were born.

1258
01:33:06,286 --> 01:33:07,745
You're my father.

1259
01:33:12,333 --> 01:33:13,585
I'm your father.

1260
01:33:13,793 --> 01:33:15,253
Oh my God.

1261
01:33:29,642 --> 01:33:30,810
Wait a second.

1262
01:33:33,813 --> 01:33:35,064
Alright, what happened here?

1263
01:33:35,273 --> 01:33:39,444
Oh, no, no, sweetie.
Your son was a perfect gentleman.

1264
01:33:43,198 --> 01:33:45,158
How long have you known about this guy?

1265
01:33:45,408 --> 01:33:48,077
I've been trying to tell you
for years now. I just...

1266
01:33:54,042 --> 01:33:56,336
There's so much I wanna tell you.

1267
01:33:56,419 --> 01:34:00,006
I just could never...I could never
find which seems to be the right time.

1268
01:34:01,674 --> 01:34:05,595
I thought you were just sick of me.
- Sick of you?

1269
01:34:05,720 --> 01:34:10,099
No, scared of you maybe a little bit
but never sick of you.

1270
01:34:15,021 --> 01:34:16,439
You're like a...

1271
01:34:18,024 --> 01:34:19,901
you're the air that I breath.

1272
01:34:39,212 --> 01:34:41,798
Will somebody please uncuff me?

1273
01:35:06,489 --> 01:35:08,283
I can't believe...

1274
01:35:15,999 --> 01:35:18,585
I got your back.
You're my boy now.

1275
01:35:22,755 --> 01:35:25,592
Hey, come here, hug your brother.

1276
01:35:26,217 --> 01:35:28,928
Right now, let's go, hug your brother.

1277
01:35:50,950 --> 01:35:53,203
Well, mom, you were right.

1278
01:35:53,453 --> 01:35:56,122
Dad did have sex with Tony's mom.

1279
01:35:56,247 --> 01:35:58,875
Kudos to you!
Well, well done.

1280
01:36:07,509 --> 01:36:08,635
Molly?

1281
01:36:11,054 --> 01:36:12,514
Molly Charlsworth?

1282
01:36:12,722 --> 01:36:14,182
She left town, I think.

1283
01:36:16,267 --> 01:36:18,353
Isn't she your partner?
- Yeah.

1284
01:36:18,561 --> 01:36:21,397
Is she gonna be back?
- I don't think so.

1285
01:36:24,400 --> 01:36:27,654
One less actor in New York
for you guys to compete with.

1286
01:36:28,363 --> 01:36:29,906
You ready, Vince?

1287
01:36:30,573 --> 01:36:32,242
Yeah.
- Go ahead.

1288
01:37:02,772 --> 01:37:05,900
You know the day, you asked
me about my worst secret

1289
01:37:08,528 --> 01:37:12,282
my most personal secret
the secret of all my secrets.

1290
01:37:13,199 --> 01:37:15,493
At that time, I don't understand it.

1291
01:37:18,955 --> 01:37:20,707
But now I get it.

1292
01:37:25,795 --> 01:37:29,674
First, I wanna begin you why,
where I'm from...

1293
01:37:30,633 --> 01:37:33,720
My name is Vincent Rizzo
and I'm from City Island...

1294
01:37:42,312 --> 01:37:44,063
{y:i}Somehow with Tony's appearance...

1295
01:37:44,147 --> 01:37:46,566
{y:i}a lot of good things happened.

1296
01:37:48,568 --> 01:37:50,737
You are one lying son of a bitch!

1297
01:37:55,116 --> 01:37:58,745
To my husband, the best actor in City Island.

1298
01:37:59,496 --> 01:38:01,664
{y:i}I guessed I should've looked for a musical.

1299
01:38:01,789 --> 01:38:04,501
How's that man? It's good?
- Fantastic.

1300
01:38:04,709 --> 01:38:08,046
To my father, the only actor on City Island.
- Hey, watch yourself.

1301
01:38:09,297 --> 01:38:11,925
And here, we're going again.
But it's not you, you were excellent, Vince.

1302
01:38:12,008 --> 01:38:15,011
We're making some adjustments.
- Okay, whatever. I'm here.

1303
01:38:18,056 --> 01:38:20,350
{y:i}Every busy city needs an island of peace.

1304
01:38:20,558 --> 01:38:23,895
{y:i}Just like every busy soul needs a place to propose.

1305
01:38:24,020 --> 01:38:26,689
Hey, Vinnie, get over here.

1306
01:38:27,106 --> 01:38:28,900
{y:i}Me, I was lucky..

1307
01:38:30,860 --> 01:38:32,862
{y:i}because God he has a way of busting you...

1308
01:38:33,071 --> 01:38:35,281
{y:i}when you most need it.

1309
01:38:36,282 --> 01:38:40,453
{y:i}And he has a way of giving you a second chance.
To attend for your screw ups.

1310
01:38:40,787 --> 01:38:42,956
{y:i}Now, I got my second chance.

1311
01:38:43,623 --> 01:38:45,041
Okay, let's eat!

1312
01:38:47,043 --> 01:38:50,046
