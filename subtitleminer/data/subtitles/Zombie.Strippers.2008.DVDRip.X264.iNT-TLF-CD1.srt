00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:34,160
George W. Bush has won his fourth
consecutive term as president...

2
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:37,159
... taking Florida,
which due to a computer glitch...

3
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:40,160
... inherent in the Jeb B. voting
terminals, tallied one single vote...

4
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:43,720
... for President Bush
and Vice President Schwarzenegger.

5
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:46,199
Bush's presidency
was unanimously declared...

6
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,319
... legally binding
by the Supreme Court...

7
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,320
...as well as totally cool,
by Chief Justice Jenna Bush...

8
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:54,720
... who subsequently set in motion
another supreme kegger.

9
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,959
Following the landslide victory...

10
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,960
...a constitutional amendment banning
public nudity was implemented.

11
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,879
Shortly thereafter,
President Bush dissolved Congress...

12
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:05,239
... claiming it was cramping his style.

13
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:07,559
American troops
continue to be strung thin...

14
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,560
... due to the still-raging wars in Iraq,
Afghanistan, Syria, Iran, Lebanon...

15
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:16,160
...Libya, Pakistan, Venezuela,
France, Canada and Alaska.

16
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:20,119
One American corporation has
discovered...

17
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:23,120
...a scientific military solution
to the looming troop-shortage crisis.

18
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:27,359
Here at W Industries, top scientists...

19
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,919
... in cooperation
with the United States military...

20
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,199
...and due to the shortage
of American troops...

21
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:35,200
...are developing a toxic,
easily transmittable chemo virus...

22
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:38,479
... that acts to reanimate dead tissue.

23
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:41,480
But we assure you, due to the extreme
level of volatility of such tests...

24
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,959
... the research facilities
are unequivocally...

25
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,960
... in accordance with the United States
government level of standards...

26
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:53,080
... fail-safe.

27
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,440
Behold a pale horse.

28
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,960
Please help me! Help me!

29
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,199
Sir.

30
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,200
They're here.

31
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,599
Major. Thank God you guys are here.

32
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,079
-lt's bad in there.
-lt better be, right, lieutenant?

33
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,799
We're the best of the best.
We drink napalm and piss fire.

34
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,999
Semper fi.
So, what seems to be the problem?

35
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Believe it or not, zombies.

36
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,440
l like knives.

37
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:26,080
He likes knives.

38
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,839
Nothing like a good challenge.

39
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,399
We improvise and adapt, sir.

40
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,719
We just stopped that thing.
What was that called?

41
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,439
-Armageddon, sir.
-That's the one.

42
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,239
Lt. Ryker here killed Satan himself
with a sharp stick.

43
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,599
-Good work, soldier.
-Just doing my duty, sir.

44
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,479
-So where were we?
-Zombies, sir.

45
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,839
That's right, zombies.

46
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,639
Let's tell the squad the good news.

47
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:48,119
l live for it, sir.

48
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,759
Fall out, you maggots!
On the double, let's go, move it.

49
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,599
Go, go, go.
Recon's in zero minus three minutes.

50
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,600
On the double, dirtbags.
Today is a good day to die.

51
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,039
-Meet the team, private?
-Yes, sir.

52
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,919
Welcome to the best of the best, son.

53
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,920
Now move out, soldier!

54
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,599
Zombies.

55
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,600
Shit.

56
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,800
Take a good look, soldier.

57
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:23,840
You see this?
There's fucking zombies out there.

58
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,120
Seen worse.

59
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,600
So, what are we dealing with here, doc?

60
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,719
lt's a chemo virus
designed to reanimate dead tissue...

61
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,079
...and jump-start
the brain's motor function.

62
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,080
This would allow, say, a soldier
to continue fighting after death.

63
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:47,120
After one experiences death,
fear is more or less gone.

64
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,999
lt enhances the combat mindset...

65
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
...the brain functions of one
fearless, uninhibited...

66
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,160
...the drive of a take-no-prisoners
soldier of raw survival instincts.

67
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,800
lt more or less turns a soldier
into a super soldier.

68
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,119
The good news is...

69
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,799
...the test subjects in there
are not trained soldiers...

70
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,800
...but poor lost unfortunates
who've had no other choice...

71
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,719
...but to sell themselves
to scientific experiments.

72
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,519
Homeless, illegal immigrants,
the American middle class.

73
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,959
And what's the bad news?

74
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,959
The chemo virus'
molecular structures...

75
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,599
...deteriorate at an exponential rate
from host to host.

76
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,319
The zombified dead after that
are but mindless monsters...

77
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:28,039
...with a voracious appetite
for living flesh.

78
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,479
The virus is based
on the human X chromosome...

79
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,839
...so it stays more pure
from woman to woman.

80
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,719
But once you get a man in there,
like everything else...

81
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,799
...it all goes to shit.

82
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,800
So, what do we have to do to take
one of these zombies down, doc?

83
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:44,480
Well, what works for us is we've been
surgically removing...

84
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:48,200
...the medulla oblongata.

85
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,919
Or that.

86
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,679
We also found that a strong
electromagnetic pulse...

87
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,679
...can knock them out.

88
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,680
Right. Lieutenant, give the word.

89
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,879
All right, it's a turkey shoot.

90
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,880
Let's lose this armour.

91
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,439
Jesus.

92
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:09,440
What team of fuckups
designed this place?

93
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,520
We track as many as we can,
then we hit them with the big E.

94
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:35,239
-What, Elvis?
-Not Elvis, EMPD.

95
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,279
-Damn.
-Lieutenant.

96
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,280
-Alpha, Bravo, ten-hut!
-Move out.

97
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,160
Com station up and operational.

98
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,079
Alpha, Bravo, incoming at 0400.

99
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:52,080
Twenty metres, 10 o'clock.

100
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,960
Hold tight. Draw them in.

101
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:15,520
Holy shit.

102
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:23,399
Sometimes l like guns.

103
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,400
Alpha, Bravo, incoming at 6 o'clock.

104
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,519
Wait for it.

105
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,519
Do it.

106
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:50,520
Wait for it.

107
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:56,160
Blast them.

108
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,079
Report. Comstat, come in.

109
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,159
Kwan, you there?

110
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,319
Com's down.

111
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,320
Electromagnetic blast.
Equipment's fried.

112
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:18,160
So how do we make sure
they're zero threat?

113
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,440
Oh, no.

114
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,919
Sir, the com phone....

115
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:39,920
Look out!

116
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:57,440
Somebody made a mistake.
Somebody made a big fucking mistake.

117
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,160
Fire at will.

118
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:06,640
Alpha, Bravo, get to the side!

119
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:32,279
-l want more bombs, sir.
-Sir, orders from comstat base.

120
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,639
The memo reads:

121
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,799
''Osama to attack
within the United States.''

122
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,119
Wait, what does that mean?

123
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,719
lt's code. lt means
we've been warned of the dangers.

124
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,559
But better to ignore the problem
and it's bound to go away.

125
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,560
Got it. That's what we're doing?

126
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,719
Me, personally...

127
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,720
...l'm aiming for the head.

128
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:27,840
All right. The good old-fashioned way.

129
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:30,880
Alpha, Bravo teams,
let's clean up the rest of the mess.

130
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:41,080
-Wrap it up.
-Recon!

131
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,279
This is where it bit me.

132
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,559
lt's not that bad. Don't worry, son.

133
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,560
We'll get you fixed up right as rain.

134
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,479
-Mission accomplished, sir.
-All right.

135
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:10,079
Where'd l hear that before?
Let's get a head count.

136
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:13,080
Yes, sir. Squad, form up.

137
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,920
Where's Byrdflough?

138
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:05,200
Off the stage, asshole.

139
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:20,640
Hi.

140
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:29,400
l'm looking for Madam Blavatski.

141
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:34,840
God bless.

142
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Are you kidding me?
This place is more illegal than that lD.

143
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,079
All right.

144
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:26,080
That was the ever-feline Kat.

145
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Now, she's working hard up there
for you boys, so be extra nice.

146
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:34,400
And remember, Rhinos
is an ultra-exclusive gentlemen's club.

147
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:39,360
So exclusive members only,
if you know what l mean.

148
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:45,920
Now, the management
would also like to remind you...

149
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:49,040
...that nothing comes out
of your pants...

150
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:52,160
...but tips for the girls.

151
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,119
Bitch.

152
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,359
-What a talent.
-Slut.

153
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,679
-My hero.
-Whatever.

154
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:13,680
Okay, über-sluts, we have new meat.

155
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,559
This is Jessy.

156
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,079
-Local girl, right?
-Yeah.

157
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,199
Born and bred, Sartre, Nebraska.

158
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,759
-Figures.
-Grew up on a farm?

159
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,679
Yep. Right again.

160
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,439
-Eat a lot of corn?
-Yep.

161
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,319
Good. Now, we make her at home...

162
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,679
...so we are all-- How you say?

163
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,399
--happy with the crabs.

164
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:35,079
No, not crabs, but other crustaceans.

165
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,919
You mean '' happy as a clam.''

166
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:39,679
Clams are molluscs,
not crustaceans.

167
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,879
Whatever.

168
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,559
So you sit here.

169
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:46,560
We are all happy as clams.

170
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Hi.

171
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,959
Okay.

172
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,359
Lilith!

173
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,360
Go, go, go. You dance.

174
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,600
Oh, Mr. Essko, hello.

175
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,159
Shut your pie-hole.

176
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,799
Hey, boss.

177
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,679
Back off.
Back off, you walking herpie, you.

178
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:22,159
This is nice.

179
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,319
Never touch.

180
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:26,320
Not the jacket,
not the shirt, not the hair.

181
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,959
You touch me again, l'll kill you.

182
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,960
l love a man of authority.

183
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:51,520
Well, hey there, sweet thing.

184
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,439
How about some private time?

185
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,440
Fat chance, fuckwad.

186
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:39,159
And now, an announcement...

187
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:42,160
...from your host, Mr. lan Essko.

188
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:48,040
Tired of that same old lap dance?

189
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:51,559
Well, drop an extra C-note, fellas...

190
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:54,560
...and experience Rhinos'
exclusive face dance.

191
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:00,640
One of our lovely ladies
will sit on your face...

192
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,080
...and give birth to your head.

193
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:10,360
Why not try it
with our lovely Lilith here?

194
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:14,720
Experience the essence du Goth.

195
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:19,360
Exclusively here at Rhinos.

196
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:31,079
All right, boys.

197
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:34,080
Give it up for Lilith,
the dark queen of the underworld.

198
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:38,400
And remember, tip the girls well
and they come out with nothing on...

199
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,239
...but the music.

200
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,479
And now...

201
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,480
...back by her own popular demand...

202
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,920
...a legend in her own mind...

203
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:54,080
...Jeannie.

204
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,720
Bitch.

205
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,519
Okay, what the hell
are you doing here?

206
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:19,319
ls it that apparent
that l've never done this before?

207
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,639
Let me guess,
Granny fell and broke her hip?

208
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:24,640
She's Nana, and it's for her colostomy.

209
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:28,040
Hey, Berenge, Trotskyite,
you go work floor.

210
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,599
Lap dance.

211
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,879
Lap dance?

212
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:38,199
Syphilitical lap dance?

213
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,079
Yeah.

214
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,519
-You want a lap dance?
-No.

215
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:45,520
-You don't look so good.
-l'm fine.

216
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,719
Well, all right, boys.

217
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,919
Now our own Bobby Sox...

218
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:08,920
...is gonna tease you
with her sock tease.

219
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:35,079
All right, all right.

220
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,839
What the hell's going on out here?

221
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:39,840
Dude, that guy's dead.

222
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,919
Oh, he's okay.

223
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:45,920
-Where the fuck's Paco?
-Dog, l'm right here.

224
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:49,120
Clean this mess up, would you?
All right?

225
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,159
l'm only two of me.

226
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:55,160
Remember the Alamo. Davy Crockett.

227
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:58,400
-Whatever.
-Yeah.

228
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,840
Knocked up.

229
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,840
l remember when l was once star.

230
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,360
Young stripper with dream.

231
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:15,440
Dream to sing to swanky Parisian elite
in smoky nightclub.

232
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,799
We live for dreams.

233
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:23,800
We die for dream.

234
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:27,360
That which doesn't kill us
makes us stronger, right?

235
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,279
This new girl.

236
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:32,159
l don't think she's ever stripped before.

237
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,759
-You think?
-Well, maybe you can talk to her.

238
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,639
Give her some pointers.

239
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,919
Yeah, sure. But everything great...

240
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:41,399
...must first wear hideous
and monstrous masks...

241
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:44,400
...in order to inscribe themselves
on the hearts of humanity.

242
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,999
Davis, what are you doing here?

243
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,239
-l need to talk to you.
-Make it quick.

244
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,479
l need to know what
the meaning of life is.

245
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,639
You're kidding.

246
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,640
l know we're Christians, and what
you're doing is a sin, but the intent is...

247
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,279
...well, Christlike,
you sacrificing yourself and all.

248
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,759
So, what are morals?
Does the ends justify the means?

249
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,760
But then again, the road to hell
is paved with good intentions, so....

250
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,919
Darn, l'm out of clichés.

251
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,679
What do you want from me, Davis?

252
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,679
Ultimate truth.

253
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:23,079
You're the last pure thing l know
in this world.

254
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:25,399
Maybe there's more truth
to the human condition...

255
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:28,400
...in me taking my clothes off
for emotionally stunted men...

256
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,919
...so that my grandmother
can shit in a bag...

257
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:33,920
...than me staying virginal and pure
for you.

258
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:36,919
Jessy, please, don't do this.

259
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:39,920
But l gotta. For Nana.

260
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:46,079
Well, if you must.

261
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,679
l'm gonna watch.

262
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:50,680
And now, for all you cornhuskers...

263
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:54,040
...midnight cow-tippers
and lnternet explorers...

264
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:57,440
...we have sweet Jessy.

265
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:29,080
What the fuck?

266
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,239
Couldn't do it, huh?

267
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,240
Kid, it takes more than desperation
to get out there on that stage.

268
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,399
You either got it or you don't, baby.

269
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,879
What the fuck is going on here?

270
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,479
Look, you pert little minxy slut.

271
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:52,359
You get back out there right now,
or you're dead to me.

272
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:54,839
lan, will you just fucking relax?

273
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,639
l'll take her time.

274
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,959
Jesus Christ.

275
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,960
You have to be a warrior, a soldier.
Fearless, uninhibited.

276
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,759
A stripper with a take-no-prisoners...

277
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,519
...raw survival instinct.

278
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:11,520
So please, for my sake, suck it up.

279
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,640
-lt's a war out there.
-Fucking A, sister.

280
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:52,160
Get this asshole out of here!
Get him out!

281
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:55,360
My show, you won't watch.

282
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:03,999
Come on, in here.

283
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
ln here.

284
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,559
Stay out of there, he's dangerous.

285
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:14,560
He's my hero.
l just wanna shake his hand.

286
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:20,159
Get inside, get her inside,
get her inside, get her inside.

287
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:23,160
Come on, come on, that's it.

288
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:31,039
Do we call someone about this?

289
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:34,039
Who? We're an illegal operation here,
asshole.

290
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:37,040
We call the police, we're fucked.
This blows.

291
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:41,319
Okay, okay, okay. Plan.

292
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:44,119
First, you go out front,
kill everybody that saw it.

293
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:47,120
-Hey, pendejo, l'm a lover, not a fighter.
-All right.

294
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:50,639
Second--
Second, we dispose of the body.

295
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,919
Yes, yeah, wild dogs.

296
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:55,920
French Equatorial New Guinea
cannibals.

297
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:17,560
You're dead.

298
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:26,400
l am?

299
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,639
lmagine that.

300
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:32,640
Oh, no, no, no, hold on.
You're fucking dead.

301
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,799
l was.

302
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:38,800
-But now l'm back.
-Not possible.

303
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:42,239
This is not possible.

304
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,199
How does it feel?

305
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:47,200
Great. l've never felt more alive.

306
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Oh, sweet irony.

307
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:56,119
Hey, where are you going?

308
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:59,120
l'm going to dance.

309
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:20,160
Announce her.

310
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:24,159
And now...

311
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:27,159
...back from the dead...

312
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:30,160
...Kat.

313
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:55,040
Yeah!

314
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:54,759
You're cute.

315
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:56,679
-Me?
-Yeah.

316
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:59,680
l could just eat you alive.

317
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:03,999
Come here.

318
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,159
No way.

319
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,839
Jimmy, Jimmy.

320
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:09,479
Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy.

321
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:12,480
Hey, you think this is a good idea?

322
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:15,279
l mean, wasn't that bitch dead
a minute ago?

323
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:18,239
Fuck it.
What's the worst that can happen?

324
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:21,240
Sit.

325
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:25,440
This is gonna be so great.

326
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:47,040
Allow me.

327
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:57,120
Look, maybe l should go.

328
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:00,920
Go? lt's only just begun.

329
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,640
Look, this isn't so much fun anymore.

330
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:09,360
Let me make it up to you.

331
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:13,640
Oh, yeah. Hands are cold.

332
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:18,360
That's interesting.
Your tongue is so dry.

333
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:24,480
l get it wet.

334
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:43,120
Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy

335
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:49,040
But wait, there's more.

336
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,879
Oh, God.

337
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:03,839
Oh, God.

338
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:06,359
-No.
-No, thank you.

339
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:09,360
Suit yourself.

340
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,679
Did you see...?

341
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,439
Holy shit!

342
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:21,439
Hey, do l gotta clean this mess up?

343
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:24,440
You see this?
You see this, what colour is that?

344
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:27,559
-Cappuccino?
-Right.

345
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:30,560
Meaning you're cleaning this entire
fucking mess up. Can you handle that?

346
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,719
Or do l have to find somebody else
in front of Home Depot?

347
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:36,720
Okay, man, okay. l got it, all right?

348
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:43,559
ln old country, we use eels.

349
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:46,079
-Eels?
-Yes, eels.

350
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,519
They eat the flesh.

351
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,439
Sorry, but we don't have eels.

352
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:53,439
Best we can do is a few rats,
maybe the odd ferret.

353
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:56,440
With any luck, a badger or two.

354
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,799
Badgers?

355
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,800
Badgers?
We don't need no stinking badgers.

356
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:05,120
Just clean this up.

357
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:08,440
Come on, Paco, l'll help you.
l'll get the big pieces.

358
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:18,800
Jesus fucking sheep shit.

359
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,719
Boss, we have a problem.

360
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,799
Could be problem.

361
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:28,239
Yeah, well, the only problem
l've got right now...

362
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:31,240
...is Señor lllegal over here,
who's downing my booze.

363
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:34,439
Oh, really?

364
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,999
How about this, huh, boss?

365
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,639
Maybe this is something worse
to worry about.

366
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:42,640
Okay, let's see if l've got this straight.

367
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:48,480
Our best stripper
is a reanimated corpse...

368
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,559
...who is feeding off the living flesh
of our customers...

369
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:54,560
...who in turn reanimate,
even if they're just a fucking head?

370
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,920
You-- You don't see this as a problem?

371
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,679
This is what l think.

372
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:07,680
l see stripper dead.
And then l see her not so dead.

373
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:12,320
l see severed head,
and not so dead too.

374
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:16,160
But l also see not-so-dead
stripper strip. And shiznit, she--

375
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,519
How you say?

376
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:21,999
--knock them dead.

377
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,439
Or not so dead, as case may be.

378
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:26,879
So your fucking point?

379
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:29,239
My point is lots of money.

380
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:31,519
l never see performance before
like tonight.

381
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:34,439
Nice boys out there never see
performance before like tonight.

382
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:37,440
So l think nice boys
tell more nice boys.

383
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:40,800
And soon, lots of nice boys
throwing money at us.

384
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,400
So that is why l say
not-so-dead nice boy in head form...

385
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:53,119
...maybe not so much problem.

386
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:56,120
His head easy to--

387
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:59,200
How you say?

388
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:02,079
--brush under carpet.

389
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:04,199
Head?

390
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,039
l see no head.

391
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:08,039
What head?

392
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:10,519
-You see head?
-Me?

393
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:13,520
Severed zombie head? Please.

394
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:30,560
This makes so much more sense now.

395
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:43,599
Good. All here.

396
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,439
What the fuck was that out there?

397
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:48,440
Yeah, she was amazing.

398
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:52,240
-What?
-Girls, we talk.

399
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,359
ln the old country...

400
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:58,279
...l strip to buy bread and borsch.
And vodka.

401
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:01,280
Hey, Lilith, you wake up.

402
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:04,360
l talk to you.

403
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,679
Oh, my God.

404
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:14,680
She's dead.

405
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:18,080
No, l'm not.

406
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:26,320
Figures. Go ahead, kiss her ass.

407
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:30,039
You have the personality of clay.

408
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:32,359
Spineless jellyfish.

409
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:35,360
Kat says jump and you grovel,
begging her to tell you how high.

410
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:39,520
Yeah. When she says ''zombie,''
you say, '' how dead?''

411
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:44,119
You're surprised?

412
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:47,120
Actually, there's more.
Kat eat nice boy.

413
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:50,639
But leftovers still alive.

414
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:53,159
-Cool.
-How's it feel?

415
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:56,160
Death.

416
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:59,560
lt's like snow and the stars.

417
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,719
That's pretty.

418
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:06,720
l remember once lying in the snow
under a clear blanket of stars.

419
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:12,160
And there were so many stars.

420
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:15,559
l couldn't comprehend
what it was like...

421
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:18,519
...that vast and noble void.

422
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:20,479
But now...

423
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:23,480
...l understand it.

424
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:26,520
l feel l'm a part of it.

425
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:30,240
That infinite nothingness.

426
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:34,679
l wanna strip. Who's on?

427
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:37,680
Fuck it, l'm gonna dance.

428
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:45,960
Death is good.

429
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:01,279
Okay.

430
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:04,239
lt looks like war has been declared.

431
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:06,759
Give it up for Jeannie.

432
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:09,760
The dance of the bruised ego.

433
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,959
Get off!

434
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:26,599
-Go away.
-Come on, you're trash.

435
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:29,600
-You're done, bitch.
-Bring us Lilith!

436
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:32,640
-You suck!
-Lilith!

437
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:40,480
You.

438
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:53,200
Oh, baby, you are morbid.

439
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:57,280
l love your tongue.

440
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:04,360
Oh, wow, this is so fucking cool.

441
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:09,480
l love your tongue.
