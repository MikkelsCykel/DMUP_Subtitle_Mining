00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:49,218
We'll pick up your drawing.

2
00:02:50,029 --> 00:02:51,690
Hi, Mom.

3
00:02:55,134 --> 00:02:58,001
- Bye, Rita.
- See you, honey.

4
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:00,297
- How was schooI today?
- OK.

5
00:03:00,472 --> 00:03:03,498
- What did you do?
- Nothing.

6
00:03:03,676 --> 00:03:06,110
- Who's at home?
- Nobody.

7
00:03:31,604 --> 00:03:33,595
All right!

8
00:03:33,772 --> 00:03:36,070
- What did you wish for?
- He can't tell.

9
00:03:36,241 --> 00:03:39,176
- He can choose to.
- You never do.

10
00:03:39,345 --> 00:03:41,313
I bet you wished for a skateboard.

11
00:03:42,715 --> 00:03:46,412
- They got you the good one.
- Yes!

12
00:03:46,585 --> 00:03:49,349
- Comes with this.
- Thanks, you guys.

13
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:51,887
I got you this.

14
00:03:52,658 --> 00:03:55,024
I know what it is.

15
00:03:56,228 --> 00:03:58,162
- Thanks, A.D.
- All rightie.

16
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:00,958
Here we go.

17
00:04:01,133 --> 00:04:03,601
- What's that?
- What a pretty cupboard!

18
00:04:03,769 --> 00:04:05,930
- Where'd you get that?
- Found it.

19
00:04:06,105 --> 00:04:09,404
- And you washed it?
- Yes, Mother.

20
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:12,336
- Thanks.
- No problem.

21
00:04:12,511 --> 00:04:15,173
- Is there a key?
- There's no key.

22
00:04:15,347 --> 00:04:17,941
- I have lots of keys.
- You save keys?

23
00:04:18,117 --> 00:04:20,551
I've collected them since I was a girI.

24
00:04:21,654 --> 00:04:24,646
- Think it means anything?
- I didn't say that!

25
00:04:24,823 --> 00:04:29,351
- I think she has secrets.
- What a sweet thing to say!

26
00:04:30,229 --> 00:04:31,696
Watch out.

27
00:04:31,864 --> 00:04:36,358
Guys, not inside. If you want
to ride, you'd better go now.

28
00:04:36,535 --> 00:04:38,366
Not alone.

29
00:04:40,472 --> 00:04:42,702
A.D.?

30
00:04:42,875 --> 00:04:44,775
All right. Let's go.

31
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:49,441
Here we go.

32
00:04:55,954 --> 00:04:57,922
OK, watch this.

33
00:05:00,559 --> 00:05:04,086
- I can do that.
- Piece of cake.

34
00:05:04,263 --> 00:05:07,289
I got you something
to celebrate your birthday.

35
00:05:11,036 --> 00:05:13,869
- It's like an antique.
- Yeah.

36
00:05:14,039 --> 00:05:17,634
I couldn't do much, you know.
It just reminded me of you.

37
00:05:22,448 --> 00:05:26,782
- OK. See if one fits.
- I love these guys.

38
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:31,647
- If one fits, can I have it?
- I'll give it to you.

39
00:05:31,824 --> 00:05:33,416
Thanks.

40
00:05:40,933 --> 00:05:43,424
- It works!
- Let me see.

41
00:05:43,602 --> 00:05:47,231
My grandmother gave me that one.

42
00:05:47,406 --> 00:05:49,601
She was dying
and had nothing to leave me,

43
00:05:49,775 --> 00:05:54,269
so I picked up that key and I said
I wanted it more than anything.

44
00:05:55,481 --> 00:05:58,780
- What will I put in the cupboard?
- Here. Put this in.

45
00:06:06,391 --> 00:06:09,656
- Omri, let's read.
- OK.

46
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:16,697
Did I know her, your grandma?

47
00:06:16,869 --> 00:06:21,363
No, you didn't.
She would have loved you.

48
00:06:27,946 --> 00:06:30,073
"Because he was... "

49
00:06:30,249 --> 00:06:32,217
"Chapter Eight: Margalo. "

50
00:06:32,384 --> 00:06:34,181
"Because he was so small,"

51
00:06:34,353 --> 00:06:37,652
"Stuart was often hard to find
around the house. "

52
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:43,159
"His father and his mother
and his brother George... "

53
00:06:43,328 --> 00:06:47,355
- "Seldom. "
- "... seldom could locate him"

54
00:06:47,533 --> 00:06:49,763
"by looking for him. "

55
00:06:49,935 --> 00:06:53,098
"Usually, they had to call him. "

56
00:06:53,272 --> 00:06:59,108
"The house often...
echoed with cries of 'Stuart'!"

57
00:06:59,278 --> 00:07:01,576
"Stuart... "

58
00:10:40,665 --> 00:10:43,156
You hurt me.

59
00:10:53,145 --> 00:10:55,978
- Hello.
- Demon!

60
00:10:56,148 --> 00:10:58,639
- Demon?
- Giant!

61
00:10:58,817 --> 00:11:00,978
<i>- Me?
- Omri!</i>

62
00:11:03,855 --> 00:11:06,016
<i>Omri, we're late.</i>

63
00:11:11,897 --> 00:11:13,865
Come on, buddy, hurry.

64
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:20,534
Come on.

65
00:11:29,981 --> 00:11:31,608
Look for my bike shorts.

66
00:11:31,783 --> 00:11:35,219
- Working on the house today?
- Yeah. Have a nice day.

67
00:11:35,387 --> 00:11:38,754
- Please make a skylight.
- Goodbye, guys.

68
00:11:39,524 --> 00:11:42,254
- Bye-bye, guys.
- Bye, Mum.

69
00:11:42,427 --> 00:11:46,193
- I'll be right back.
- That wasn't too bad.

70
00:11:46,364 --> 00:11:48,491
Pretty day.

71
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:55,167
- Did you forget something?
- Why?

72
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:57,968
- Did you?
- No.

73
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:03,113
...but the dad might open
a Chinese restaurant.

74
00:12:03,281 --> 00:12:07,581
We've skimmed this chapter,
now let's have some questions.

75
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:11,218
- Emily?
- Does Fudge's family want...?

76
00:12:11,389 --> 00:12:15,257
- I love the Indian. He's so great.
- Why?

77
00:12:20,398 --> 00:12:22,764
Hurry, Mum. Open the door.

78
00:12:22,934 --> 00:12:25,300
You must be getting hungry.

79
00:12:26,538 --> 00:12:28,005
We're home!

80
00:13:14,619 --> 00:13:18,749
- I think your mealy worms are dead.
- They're in the pupa stage.

81
00:13:18,924 --> 00:13:22,985
I've seen the pupa stage.
These suckers are dead.

82
00:13:23,161 --> 00:13:28,030
- Honey, you can start them again.
- I'm sick. I'm tired.

83
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:30,731
Come on.

84
00:13:45,951 --> 00:13:48,511
- I'm heading up now.
- Gili going up?

85
00:13:48,687 --> 00:13:51,247
- He's looking for his Walkman.
- OK.

86
00:13:56,661 --> 00:13:59,323
How do you feeI about skylights?

87
00:14:59,424 --> 00:15:02,154
I won't hurt you.

88
00:15:02,327 --> 00:15:05,125
- This is magic?
- I guess.

89
00:15:06,731 --> 00:15:09,063
I think you are a dream.

90
00:15:11,836 --> 00:15:16,933
- Are you a reaI Indian?
- I am Onondaga gah.

91
00:15:17,108 --> 00:15:19,508
Wolf Clan. Iroquois.

92
00:15:19,678 --> 00:15:22,442
Iroquois? I've heard of them.

93
00:15:25,784 --> 00:15:27,911
Were you always this small?

94
00:15:28,987 --> 00:15:31,956
I am not small. You are big!

95
00:15:32,123 --> 00:15:35,024
But I'm not big. You're so small.

96
00:15:39,664 --> 00:15:44,260
- Can you be the Peacemaker?
- I'm a boy. My name is Omri.

97
00:15:45,637 --> 00:15:49,368
- The Great Spirit can be a child?
- Who are you?

98
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:54,974
Ohkwahe. Little Bear.

99
00:15:55,814 --> 00:15:57,406
Little Bear.

100
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:19,466
- How do you know English?
- We know the English.

101
00:16:19,637 --> 00:16:21,662
They sent for us
to fight the French for them.

102
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:24,570
When? What year?

103
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:29,910
- Year 1761.
- 1761?

104
00:16:34,552 --> 00:16:36,884
Will you come out, Little Bear?

105
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:16,889
You are so reaI!

106
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:22,527
I am. Yes. Are you?

107
00:17:41,152 --> 00:17:45,612
If it is magic... the magic
will take me home. I shall go now.

108
00:17:47,826 --> 00:17:50,454
But you just got here.

109
00:17:50,628 --> 00:17:53,324
Look. This is for you.

110
00:17:58,603 --> 00:18:02,300
- What is it?
- It's a tepee. You know, a tepee.

111
00:18:02,474 --> 00:18:04,704
I do not know.

112
00:18:08,246 --> 00:18:10,771
- Terrible.
- It's plastic.

113
00:18:10,949 --> 00:18:14,908
Plaz-teck... Plazteck.

114
00:18:17,455 --> 00:18:20,117
- Terrible.
- I want to try. Wait.

115
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:38,040
You can sleep here.

116
00:18:43,815 --> 00:18:47,615
You and I, we are together? Here?

117
00:18:47,785 --> 00:18:51,448
We are here... together.

118
00:18:55,994 --> 00:18:58,258
It's weird for me, too.

119
00:18:58,429 --> 00:19:01,592
- Do you make it night now?
- It is night.

120
00:19:02,634 --> 00:19:05,159
Yes, it is night.

121
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:14,278
- I will be with you when the sun rises?
- I hope. Go to sleep now.

122
00:19:17,749 --> 00:19:19,216
Sleep?

123
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:23,985
- You sleep?
- Yes.

124
00:19:37,969 --> 00:19:39,937
It is magic.

125
00:20:30,521 --> 00:20:32,216
Halt!

126
00:21:13,965 --> 00:21:17,662
Great Omri... up.

127
00:21:18,836 --> 00:21:20,531
A new day.

128
00:21:24,175 --> 00:21:26,302
The day came without you.

129
00:21:27,345 --> 00:21:31,645
Do you make more magic now?
Plazteck things?

130
00:21:31,816 --> 00:21:34,876
- Make what?
- A white man's gun.

131
00:21:35,053 --> 00:21:37,886
No way. What else?

132
00:21:39,357 --> 00:21:41,689
Make King George.
I would like to see him.

133
00:21:41,859 --> 00:21:44,521
I don't have any kings.

134
00:21:45,563 --> 00:21:48,555
Where is your fire?
How does your wife cook?

135
00:21:48,733 --> 00:21:51,702
We're inside. We can't have a fire.

136
00:21:51,869 --> 00:21:55,327
I don't have a wife.
Do you have a wife?

137
00:21:55,506 --> 00:21:58,407
- She died.
- I'm sorry.

138
00:22:08,453 --> 00:22:10,978
I have decided to stay.

139
00:22:11,889 --> 00:22:14,687
- For a time.
- Really?

140
00:22:16,761 --> 00:22:19,821
- Really.
- I'll make you a bow and arrow.

141
00:22:19,997 --> 00:22:23,831
Good! Tools, also.
I shall build a longhouse.

142
00:22:24,869 --> 00:22:28,134
Onondaga gah do not sleep in tepee.

143
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:31,368
What's a longhouse?

144
00:22:39,517 --> 00:22:43,044
The mother's house. The clan home.
It is made of wood. Very strong.

145
00:22:43,221 --> 00:22:47,021
I can find tools. How about a horse?
I can make you a horse.

146
00:22:47,191 --> 00:22:49,853
- A horse?
- To ride.

147
00:22:50,027 --> 00:22:51,995
Iroquois walk.

148
00:23:01,205 --> 00:23:03,070
What is that?

149
00:23:05,676 --> 00:23:06,904
Outside.

150
00:23:08,646 --> 00:23:10,443
Take us outside, Earth Grasper.

151
00:23:41,512 --> 00:23:44,709
Don't run away. Please.

152
00:24:26,958 --> 00:24:29,791
This is the same as where I live.

153
00:24:34,665 --> 00:24:37,532
We'd better go. Get in. Get in.

154
00:25:05,496 --> 00:25:07,327
Get out! No!

155
00:25:48,306 --> 00:25:51,673
- I need bigger weapons.
- You're hurt.

156
00:25:51,842 --> 00:25:55,334
Not much. I need husks.

157
00:25:55,513 --> 00:25:58,209
Tie it tight. Stops the bleeding.

158
00:26:08,793 --> 00:26:11,227
Husks... Where are the husks?

159
00:26:11,395 --> 00:26:13,795
What are husks?

160
00:27:17,795 --> 00:27:19,990
Don't be afraid. It's all right.

161
00:27:20,164 --> 00:27:22,826
I'm a dream you're having.
Someone's hurt.

162
00:27:33,444 --> 00:27:36,242
Hurt? Someone?
Well, I'm your man, then.

163
00:27:37,381 --> 00:27:40,475
No, let me have a look.
I can do this in my sleep, mate.

164
00:27:40,651 --> 00:27:44,018
- Is he hurt bad?
- Dream, is it?

165
00:27:44,188 --> 00:27:46,679
I should have guessed.
Am I asleep? What?

166
00:27:46,857 --> 00:27:51,351
The whole rotten war's a nightmare.
No, it's not bad. We'll tape him up.

167
00:27:51,529 --> 00:27:55,295
I'll be jiggered! A bloomin' Injun.

168
00:27:58,002 --> 00:28:00,664
Englishman... Healer?

169
00:28:03,007 --> 00:28:08,206
Me? Well, I never heard it
put that way. Yes, I am.

170
00:28:08,379 --> 00:28:11,348
- I'm a healer.
- You are, are you?

171
00:28:11,515 --> 00:28:15,576
Well, that's something
we've got in common then, isn't it?

172
00:28:16,554 --> 00:28:21,218
Yes. This is not much.
Do you have husks?

173
00:28:21,392 --> 00:28:23,826
A bloomin' Injun!

174
00:28:24,395 --> 00:28:26,488
A right rum dream this is.

175
00:28:26,664 --> 00:28:31,465
I feeI like I'm really in this dream.
Very reaI, very clear. Exciting.

176
00:28:31,635 --> 00:28:34,763
So... Custer's last stand, was it?

177
00:28:34,939 --> 00:28:37,237
I know a bit, you know,
read up as a boy.

178
00:28:37,408 --> 00:28:40,400
- You Sitting Bull.
- No.

179
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:44,179
How!

180
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:47,815
How!

181
00:28:49,854 --> 00:28:52,084
There we go. That'll do.

182
00:28:54,992 --> 00:28:57,961
- Thank you.
- Only doing my duty.

183
00:28:58,129 --> 00:29:01,064
- Would you like to wake up now?
- I never want to wake up.

184
00:29:01,232 --> 00:29:05,760
Mud, German shells, awfuI bloody
rats. They eat at wounded men.

185
00:29:05,936 --> 00:29:08,769
Still, can't desert, even in a dream!

186
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,439
How.

187
00:29:17,414 --> 00:29:20,713
- Maybe you can dream us again.
- A pleasure.

188
00:29:20,885 --> 00:29:25,049
Tommy Atkins at your service.
Any night except if there's an attack.

189
00:29:25,222 --> 00:29:28,851
None of us gets any sleep then.
Got to win the damn war.

190
00:29:53,951 --> 00:29:56,943
You up already? Feeling better?

191
00:29:59,623 --> 00:30:02,387
I feeI pretty damn good.

192
00:30:04,028 --> 00:30:05,620
Really?

193
00:30:07,231 --> 00:30:09,631
Come on down and eat breakfast.

194
00:30:22,313 --> 00:30:24,338
You can build here.

195
00:30:37,528 --> 00:30:41,931
<i>- I need tools.
- Omri, come on down!</i>

196
00:30:42,099 --> 00:30:45,159
- Who is she?
- My mother.

197
00:30:45,869 --> 00:30:49,669
<i>Ah, genoha. The mother.</i>

198
00:30:51,742 --> 00:30:54,142
What would you like for breakfast?

199
00:30:58,182 --> 00:31:00,173
Granola, please.

200
00:31:00,985 --> 00:31:02,885
Have I died and gone to heaven?

201
00:31:03,053 --> 00:31:06,045
With berries
and cranberry juice, please.

202
00:31:42,126 --> 00:31:44,890
I have to go to schooI.

203
00:31:45,062 --> 00:31:49,055
- What is schooI?
- Learn things - all day.

204
00:31:49,233 --> 00:31:51,793
Good. Learn the stories
of your ancestors.

205
00:31:51,969 --> 00:31:54,665
Go. I am ready to build.

206
00:32:02,246 --> 00:32:06,410
- Need anything else?
- A hatchet.

207
00:32:10,854 --> 00:32:14,290
<i>Omri, let's go!</i>

208
00:32:15,993 --> 00:32:18,291
<i>- Gili.
- I'm coming.</i>

209
00:32:42,019 --> 00:32:44,078
I'll miss you.

210
00:32:50,227 --> 00:32:52,161
Come on, guys, let's go.

211
00:32:52,329 --> 00:32:54,889
- See you later Mum and Dad.
- Bye, guys.

212
00:32:55,065 --> 00:32:57,192
- Bye, Omri.
- Bye, Dad.

213
00:32:58,769 --> 00:33:01,761
OK. All right.
Can I get your attention, please?

214
00:33:01,939 --> 00:33:05,272
Are we ready? Shall we read?

215
00:33:05,442 --> 00:33:08,809
- Who wants to go first?
- Please! Can I do it?

216
00:33:08,979 --> 00:33:10,207
Emily?

217
00:33:10,381 --> 00:33:14,044
"The day I got Punisher,
the masterpiece of my collection. "

218
00:33:14,218 --> 00:33:16,709
"Also, I got
the first hologram card. "

219
00:33:16,887 --> 00:33:20,015
"I'm looking for
the originaI card of Wolverine. "

220
00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:23,125
Very good, Emily. Sam.

221
00:33:23,627 --> 00:33:27,154
"JFK. There was once a man
named JFK"

222
00:33:27,331 --> 00:33:30,425
"who always wanted to be good
and do what was right. "

223
00:33:30,601 --> 00:33:35,561
"JFK was elected President
of the United States in 1960."

224
00:33:35,739 --> 00:33:37,707
OK...

225
00:33:38,542 --> 00:33:40,339
Omri.

226
00:33:40,511 --> 00:33:42,979
"I have a magic cupboard
with a magic key. "

227
00:33:43,147 --> 00:33:46,639
"I put a plastic Indian
in the cupboard and he came alive. "

228
00:33:46,817 --> 00:33:49,342
"He is a reaI Iroquois man. "

229
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:53,422
"He talks. He eats. He trusts me. "

230
00:33:55,092 --> 00:33:58,118
That's very interesting.
Good imagination.

231
00:35:27,451 --> 00:35:29,783
OK, OK, Omri.

232
00:35:52,376 --> 00:35:55,607
Your house is fantastic.

233
00:35:55,779 --> 00:35:59,510
It will do. It is agreeable.

234
00:36:00,217 --> 00:36:03,243
I learned a lot about you today.

235
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:05,945
Good. Tonight, I will hunt for food

236
00:36:06,123 --> 00:36:10,287
and we will cook meat
and we will tell stories.

237
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:12,121
You tell all about me.

238
00:36:13,397 --> 00:36:15,194
Little Bear?

239
00:36:24,474 --> 00:36:27,966
- Do you keep the man, Omri?
- Just the bow and arrow.

240
00:36:32,349 --> 00:36:34,283
Can I watch?

241
00:36:39,423 --> 00:36:43,382
He is Mohawk.
It is an excellent bow.

242
00:36:52,936 --> 00:36:55,029
It's all right.

243
00:36:55,205 --> 00:36:56,695
It's OK.

244
00:36:59,409 --> 00:37:02,105
No... Little Bear?

245
00:37:13,824 --> 00:37:17,760
- He is dead.
- He's dead? I killed him?

246
00:37:19,062 --> 00:37:22,361
He is old. His days are done.

247
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:47,722
- We must bury him.
- Bury him? Us? Here?

248
00:37:49,593 --> 00:37:52,721
Yes. You never had
a dead man here?

249
00:37:54,631 --> 00:37:56,496
<i>Omri!</i>

250
00:37:59,469 --> 00:38:02,370
Do people die here?

251
00:38:02,539 --> 00:38:06,635
- People die. We just don't see them.
- How do you not see them?

252
00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:09,210
<i>Come down here, please.</i>

253
00:38:12,783 --> 00:38:15,183
Can't I just send him back?

254
00:38:17,888 --> 00:38:20,448
You are afraid of him?

255
00:38:21,591 --> 00:38:23,388
A dead man?

256
00:38:28,198 --> 00:38:32,658
You are a child. Yes, send him back.

257
00:38:33,637 --> 00:38:36,128
- What if he was alone?
- Then he is alone!

258
00:38:38,809 --> 00:38:40,572
Where were you?

259
00:38:40,744 --> 00:38:44,805
Guiding my nephew through the woods
to live alone and learn to be a man.

260
00:38:44,981 --> 00:38:47,313
You should not do magic
you do not understand!

261
00:38:47,484 --> 00:38:49,509
<i>Omri, now!</i>

262
00:38:54,925 --> 00:38:56,825
Send him back.

263
00:38:58,328 --> 00:39:00,762
He would want to be back.

264
00:39:11,241 --> 00:39:13,368
Are you mad at me?

265
00:39:25,889 --> 00:39:28,221
What did you do with them?

266
00:39:31,394 --> 00:39:34,261
- I buried them.
- My saw blades? Why?

267
00:39:34,431 --> 00:39:37,559
Those are my things.
I work with them. I need them.

268
00:39:37,734 --> 00:39:40,168
What do you want me to do?

269
00:39:44,241 --> 00:39:47,438
We'll go to Yapp's and buy a set.
Come on.

270
00:39:49,913 --> 00:39:52,074
I can go alone. It's a block away.

271
00:39:52,249 --> 00:39:55,047
You don't need to go with me
like I'm a baby.

272
00:39:55,218 --> 00:39:58,483
I've been before.
You just didn't know.

273
00:40:04,995 --> 00:40:06,622
OK.

274
00:41:22,205 --> 00:41:24,503
What did you get? Let me see.

275
00:41:25,876 --> 00:41:28,640
What is this junk?
Give me the money.

276
00:41:31,414 --> 00:41:35,145
You! Come back!
You don't deserve that hair!

277
00:41:52,302 --> 00:41:57,262
Look. I got this guy
to go with your Indian.

278
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:02,036
Patrick. Omri? Are you OK?

279
00:42:09,352 --> 00:42:11,980
Omri, are you sure you're OK?

280
00:42:34,210 --> 00:42:38,738
- This thing is incredible.
- Get your hands out of the way.

281
00:42:40,183 --> 00:42:43,414
Where do you think he got this?

282
00:42:43,586 --> 00:42:45,816
Look how small it is.

283
00:42:46,856 --> 00:42:49,825
- What are you looking at?
- This is incredible.

284
00:42:49,993 --> 00:42:52,655
How did you make this?

285
00:42:52,829 --> 00:42:55,024
Don't bring that rat in here.

286
00:42:55,198 --> 00:42:58,725
I found him in here, Beavis, and
my figures and my magnifying glass.

287
00:42:58,902 --> 00:43:02,599
- What else do you have that's mine?
- That thing was in here?

288
00:43:02,772 --> 00:43:05,138
This is great. Dad should see this.

289
00:43:05,308 --> 00:43:07,606
I want you both
to leave my room now.

290
00:43:07,777 --> 00:43:10,075
Jeez, temperamentaI.

291
00:43:38,908 --> 00:43:41,775
- You got to promise me...
- What?

292
00:43:43,146 --> 00:43:46,047
Little Bear, where are you?

293
00:43:47,751 --> 00:43:49,981
What are we looking for?

294
00:43:51,087 --> 00:43:52,645
Little Bear?

295
00:44:01,264 --> 00:44:03,789
Here!

296
00:44:08,705 --> 00:44:11,367
It's all right. You can come out.

297
00:44:12,275 --> 00:44:16,541
- I heard them and I ran.
- That was good.

298
00:44:16,713 --> 00:44:19,273
- They are enemies?
- Brothers.

299
00:44:19,449 --> 00:44:23,886
Brothers?
Those brothers took my house!

300
00:44:25,522 --> 00:44:27,752
I am in the dark here.

301
00:44:27,924 --> 00:44:30,552
Send me back. I want to go back.

302
00:44:30,727 --> 00:44:33,287
But I brought my friend to meet you.

303
00:44:33,463 --> 00:44:35,363
Patrick, Little Bear.

304
00:44:38,535 --> 00:44:41,470
Another Great Spirit?
Make another little man?

305
00:44:41,638 --> 00:44:44,072
No. No more men.

306
00:44:44,874 --> 00:44:48,241
- Little Bear, will you come out?
- No. You come in.

307
00:44:53,249 --> 00:44:57,208
- This is the plastic Indian?
- Not plastic any more.

308
00:44:58,321 --> 00:45:01,290
- How did you do that?
- The cupboard.

309
00:45:01,458 --> 00:45:03,323
Show me.

310
00:45:08,164 --> 00:45:10,325
Put a plastic thing in and lock it.

311
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:13,628
If it's a person,
the person is alive.

312
00:45:18,775 --> 00:45:22,267
They're reaI people.
They can even be reaI dead people.

313
00:45:24,681 --> 00:45:26,376
- I want to make one.
- Never!

314
00:45:26,549 --> 00:45:30,679
- It's a huge responsibility.
- I'm a responsible person.

315
00:45:30,854 --> 00:45:33,322
<i>Omri, I'm down here.</i>

316
00:45:34,891 --> 00:45:36,950
- Don't touch the cupboard.
- OK.

317
00:45:40,964 --> 00:45:45,731
I mean it, Patrick.
It means a lot to me.

318
00:45:56,179 --> 00:45:58,272
Thank you. I heard.

319
00:46:00,450 --> 00:46:03,112
Can I see your arm? Yeah.

320
00:46:03,286 --> 00:46:06,084
You all right?
You need to wash that.

321
00:46:06,256 --> 00:46:10,556
- It's not much.
- This child has a very strong will.

322
00:46:10,727 --> 00:46:15,426
- Good ones all have a strong will.
- Patrick is just plain defiant.

323
00:46:22,572 --> 00:46:24,699
- No! No!
- Yes!

324
00:46:24,874 --> 00:46:26,205
It's not a game!

325
00:46:30,847 --> 00:46:32,940
Slow down!

326
00:46:45,695 --> 00:46:48,755
God-dang it! Put me down!

327
00:46:48,932 --> 00:46:51,400
Dang... tarnation.

328
00:46:52,435 --> 00:46:55,097
No more. I promise no more.

329
00:46:55,271 --> 00:46:58,001
Oh, dog! Not another drop.

330
00:46:58,174 --> 00:47:01,473
- He's mine.
- Shut your eyes! Watch out, Patrick!

331
00:47:01,644 --> 00:47:04,340
Get back. Come on.

332
00:47:04,814 --> 00:47:07,180
He shot me! He shot me!

333
00:47:07,350 --> 00:47:12,219
Deliriums! Hell-fire and damnation!
That's what it is. They're deliriums!

334
00:47:12,388 --> 00:47:14,515
That rotten Kansas sheep-dip!

335
00:47:14,691 --> 00:47:18,149
William Howard, where are you,
you pot-bellied drunkard?

336
00:47:18,328 --> 00:47:21,764
Anthony Miles,
you son-of-a-buck's horse's ass!

337
00:47:22,799 --> 00:47:25,267
I can't believe it.
He really shot me!

338
00:47:25,435 --> 00:47:30,202
Darlin'! What the hell
you doin' way over there?

339
00:47:30,373 --> 00:47:34,104
- I can't believe it. This is great.
- This is not so great.

340
00:47:34,277 --> 00:47:37,440
This has got to be a delirium!
Where's my hat?

341
00:47:37,614 --> 00:47:39,980
- He can't stay here.
- I want to keep him.

342
00:47:40,149 --> 00:47:44,108
- I've lost my hat!
- Can we send him back?

343
00:47:44,287 --> 00:47:45,982
I'm comin' to get you, Darlin'!

344
00:47:46,689 --> 00:47:47,986
I want him!

345
00:47:48,157 --> 00:47:51,217
Not one more drop as long as I live.

346
00:47:52,729 --> 00:47:55,289
Oh, my dear sweet Lord!

347
00:47:55,465 --> 00:47:57,126
I need a drink.

348
00:47:58,201 --> 00:48:01,728
This is just gettin'
worse by the minute.

349
00:48:01,904 --> 00:48:03,872
What's your name?

350
00:48:05,074 --> 00:48:08,840
Boone. What's yours, Mr Delirium?

351
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:12,345
He is so cooI!

352
00:48:13,016 --> 00:48:14,847
Step back, cow pie.

353
00:48:16,352 --> 00:48:18,252
How will you take care of him?

354
00:48:18,421 --> 00:48:21,857
<i>- Patrick, time to go.
- Coming! Let me keep him.</i>

355
00:48:30,033 --> 00:48:33,400
But it's got to stay a secret.

356
00:48:33,569 --> 00:48:37,562
Listen, let me keep him here tonight.
I have this under controI.

357
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:41,301
- Bring him to schooI tomorrow.
- SchooI?

358
00:48:45,415 --> 00:48:48,043
Everybody's so big.

359
00:48:48,217 --> 00:48:51,015
You'll be OK. Don't cry.

360
00:48:51,187 --> 00:48:53,849
I always cry.

361
00:48:56,459 --> 00:48:59,485
The boys call me "Boo-hoo" Boone.

362
00:49:00,496 --> 00:49:03,556
<i>- I've got a soft heart.
- Patrick!</i>

363
00:49:07,036 --> 00:49:10,096
- Bring him to schooI. Promise?
- I promise.

364
00:49:11,140 --> 00:49:13,472
Don't put them together
- cowboys and Indians!

365
00:49:14,043 --> 00:49:15,533
Indians?

366
00:49:16,179 --> 00:49:19,478
Omri, don't turn him back, please?

367
00:49:20,283 --> 00:49:21,682
What Indians?

368
00:49:36,332 --> 00:49:38,300
Redskins.

369
00:49:39,035 --> 00:49:40,832
No!

370
00:49:41,003 --> 00:49:44,439
Wait! What in the...
You better put me down!

371
00:49:44,607 --> 00:49:46,700
Who do you think you are?

372
00:49:46,876 --> 00:49:50,937
I'm telling you the truth,
I'll lay you in your grave.

373
00:49:51,114 --> 00:49:53,708
I don't care how big you are.

374
00:49:56,853 --> 00:50:00,016
Kindly return to me my hat,
tenderfoot.

375
00:50:00,189 --> 00:50:03,989
You say you take no more men.
You tell blind stories.

376
00:50:10,366 --> 00:50:15,099
Watch out that savage don't
scalp you in your sleep, Injun lover.

377
00:50:16,072 --> 00:50:19,166
<i>You're not gonna shut me
up in here, are you?</i>

378
00:51:56,138 --> 00:52:00,541
Now we become reconciled...
as you start away.

379
00:52:14,490 --> 00:52:18,449
Now we become reconciled
as you start away.

380
00:53:05,708 --> 00:53:07,437
Don't you want this open?

381
00:53:07,610 --> 00:53:11,569
I'm not scared any more.
You can close it.

382
00:53:27,797 --> 00:53:31,289
- Is she in the dark?
- What do you mean?

383
00:53:31,467 --> 00:53:34,527
- Does she know of me?
- No.

384
00:53:37,039 --> 00:53:39,064
I'm alone.

385
00:53:41,711 --> 00:53:44,202
I need a wife.

386
00:54:14,377 --> 00:54:16,208
Come on and fight!

387
00:54:30,526 --> 00:54:32,221
Darlin'!

388
00:54:34,430 --> 00:54:39,732
Every time I try to...
We're supposed to be a team.

389
00:54:43,739 --> 00:54:45,502
Hey, dang!

390
00:54:47,743 --> 00:54:51,372
- What's the matter with that Injun?
- No, no, stop!

391
00:54:51,547 --> 00:54:53,378
Behave!

392
00:54:53,549 --> 00:54:57,610
He says I steaI his horse.
He shoots at me.

393
00:54:57,787 --> 00:55:01,154
If that's true, I'll squish him
like a bug. Boone, drop it!

394
00:55:01,991 --> 00:55:04,255
Well, she's my horse.

395
00:55:04,427 --> 00:55:07,453
- Drop it!
- No!

396
00:55:10,066 --> 00:55:15,026
I'm tired of being hauled off. I knew
you'd side with that stinkin' savage.

397
00:55:15,204 --> 00:55:18,173
He smells and he calls me
a dirty savage.

398
00:55:18,340 --> 00:55:21,537
I didn't call you dirty,
I called you stinkin'!

399
00:55:21,711 --> 00:55:23,906
Stop it, Boone!

400
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:28,540
Listen to me. Boone is leaving.
You don't have to live together.

401
00:55:28,718 --> 00:55:31,881
Where can I buy coffee?
I like to start my day with coffee.

402
00:55:32,054 --> 00:55:34,648
OK, if you'll be good,
I'll make you breakfast.

403
00:55:34,824 --> 00:55:38,521
Omri cooks! Like a woman.
You are a woman.

404
00:55:38,694 --> 00:55:42,027
Please! You guys
are so old-fashioned.

405
00:55:42,198 --> 00:55:44,689
I'll have you know
I'm a civilised man.

406
00:55:44,867 --> 00:55:47,199
Unlike some!

407
00:55:47,369 --> 00:55:49,997
Where did you come from?

408
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:53,770
I come from Texas, Mr Half-a-Brain.

409
00:55:53,943 --> 00:55:56,707
The United States of America,
comprende?

410
00:55:56,879 --> 00:55:58,642
Omri, Texas?

411
00:55:58,814 --> 00:56:00,941
- You're from Texas?
- Proud of it.

412
00:56:01,117 --> 00:56:04,109
- Where are you taking me?
- To schooI.

413
00:56:04,286 --> 00:56:07,119
- White man goes to schooI?
- That's right.

414
00:56:07,289 --> 00:56:09,655
- I go to schooI.
- You wouldn't like it.

415
00:56:09,825 --> 00:56:12,658
- He can go, I can go.
- It's too risky.

416
00:56:12,828 --> 00:56:14,796
- Whiskey?
- Risky! Dangerous!

417
00:56:14,964 --> 00:56:18,331
Good. I like danger.
Do you like danger, Texas man?

418
00:56:18,501 --> 00:56:22,494
Are you threatening me, Injun? You'll
need some help to get this scalp.

419
00:56:22,671 --> 00:56:25,572
Omri, send him back. Do it.

420
00:56:33,482 --> 00:56:38,317
Patrick! Come on! Come on!

421
00:56:41,924 --> 00:56:43,892
Come on!

422
00:56:53,769 --> 00:56:55,498
Bye-bye.

423
00:57:06,415 --> 00:57:07,712
You got him?

424
00:57:07,883 --> 00:57:11,284
CarefuI, he's so delicate. Come here.

425
00:57:12,321 --> 00:57:15,051
- Boone's in the front...
- Let me have him!

426
00:57:15,224 --> 00:57:17,351
I got to check on Little Bear.

427
00:57:17,526 --> 00:57:20,495
- You all right, Little Bear?
- Let me have that!

428
00:57:20,663 --> 00:57:22,995
- Come on! Give me him.
- Calm down, Patrick.

429
00:57:23,165 --> 00:57:25,292
Boys!

430
00:57:25,467 --> 00:57:27,401
SchooI, remember?

431
00:57:44,153 --> 00:57:45,552
All right, thank you,
Malcolm and George.

432
00:57:47,423 --> 00:57:50,449
All right, let's have...
Emily and Loretta.

433
00:57:58,200 --> 00:58:00,600
Loretta and I...

434
00:58:00,769 --> 00:58:04,296
Loretta and I are making a map
of the United States.

435
00:58:04,473 --> 00:58:06,737
We built it here on a piece of wood.

436
00:58:06,909 --> 00:58:09,309
We made the whole country
out of flour,

437
00:58:09,478 --> 00:58:14,347
water, salt and food colouring,
using beans for mountains,

438
00:58:14,516 --> 00:58:18,043
<i>yarn for the rivers
and rice for borders.</i>

439
00:58:18,220 --> 00:58:21,485
<i>We're making the desert
out of brown sugar.</i>

440
00:58:21,657 --> 00:58:24,490
<i>I thought America should
be green and yellow.</i>

441
00:58:24,660 --> 00:58:27,857
<i>Loretta thought it
should be more like beige...</i>

442
00:58:28,030 --> 00:58:30,362
What are these folks talking about?

443
00:58:30,532 --> 00:58:34,798
<i>- .. to make it more topo...
- Topographical.</i>

444
00:58:35,638 --> 00:58:39,005
Sounds to me like they've
been hitting the old tornado juice.

445
00:58:43,112 --> 00:58:46,479
You ever been west
of the Mississippi?

446
00:58:50,786 --> 00:58:52,253
Big river?

447
00:58:55,357 --> 00:58:57,154
I have travelled to the far north.

448
00:58:58,627 --> 00:59:02,757
- Land of the Micmacs.
- Micmacs?

449
00:59:04,266 --> 00:59:06,564
Sounds too cold for me.

450
00:59:08,304 --> 00:59:12,764
- Must be purty country though.
- Yes. Cold.

451
00:59:14,944 --> 00:59:16,343
Purty.

452
00:59:18,781 --> 00:59:20,874
Thank you very much.

453
00:59:21,050 --> 00:59:25,248
OK, now, let's have...
Omri and Patrick.

454
00:59:25,421 --> 00:59:28,322
I'll do it!
We both agreed that I'll do it.

455
00:59:28,490 --> 00:59:31,721
I'm the best talker.
You all know that.

456
00:59:33,595 --> 00:59:35,961
Patrick and I are making a volcano.

457
00:59:36,131 --> 00:59:38,065
It's... made out of Play...

458
00:59:38,233 --> 00:59:41,202
...mixed-up Play-Doh, it's baked...

459
00:59:42,871 --> 00:59:45,738
The smallpox.

460
00:59:47,710 --> 00:59:49,610
Yes.

461
00:59:49,778 --> 00:59:52,611
Will you marry again, Little Bear?

462
00:59:54,383 --> 00:59:56,874
If there is a woman for me.

463
01:00:01,123 --> 01:00:03,250
Maybe have another little child.

464
01:00:05,427 --> 01:00:07,657
Yes.

465
01:00:07,830 --> 01:00:10,264
I will heaI when
I have another child.

466
01:00:11,367 --> 01:00:15,133
Little children
are the sun and moon and the stars.

467
01:00:18,941 --> 01:00:20,374
<i>Good morning, boys and girls.</i>

468
01:00:20,542 --> 01:00:24,638
<i>Today, lunch is macaroni and cheese
and a build-your-own sandwich.</i>

469
01:00:24,813 --> 01:00:29,773
<i>Don't worry about the iguana,
moulting is a natural process.</i>

470
01:00:29,952 --> 01:00:32,352
<i>Origami is cancelled today.</i>

471
01:00:33,255 --> 01:00:35,018
Damn!

472
01:00:43,265 --> 01:00:47,395
All right, everybody, stay in
double line, please. Thank you.

473
01:00:47,569 --> 01:00:49,594
Follow Mrs Cox.

474
01:00:51,273 --> 01:00:54,037
That's a wonderfuI story
that you're writing.

475
01:00:54,209 --> 01:00:57,372
- Yeah.
- Have you read about the Iroquois?

476
01:00:57,546 --> 01:00:59,377
What interested you the most?

477
01:00:59,548 --> 01:01:03,211
There were six tribes
that joined together to stop the war.

478
01:01:03,385 --> 01:01:07,981
They formed a true government,
our constitution borrowed from them.

479
01:01:08,157 --> 01:01:10,990
- Yeah.
- So, what else?

480
01:01:11,160 --> 01:01:14,152
As you know, I got to get
going to computer class.

481
01:01:14,329 --> 01:01:17,196
- OK, I'll show you.
- No!

482
01:01:17,366 --> 01:01:19,493
What are you doing? Are you crazy?

483
01:01:19,668 --> 01:01:23,434
- I'm just having fun.
- They're two reaI men.

484
01:01:23,605 --> 01:01:25,698
- It's not fun.
- Shove it!

485
01:01:25,874 --> 01:01:29,867
Hello! Excuse me. What's going
on here? What happened?

486
01:01:31,780 --> 01:01:36,183
What happened?
All right, somebody start talking.

487
01:01:36,351 --> 01:01:39,218
- We can't resolve this now.
- We need to try.

488
01:01:39,388 --> 01:01:42,289
- I can resolve it. Want to see how?
- No!

489
01:01:42,458 --> 01:01:44,358
- I could do it!
- Do what?

490
01:01:44,526 --> 01:01:46,289
No, no!

491
01:01:46,462 --> 01:01:48,657
- I could show. I could.
- Show what?

492
01:01:48,831 --> 01:01:52,267
You can't. They're people.
You can't use people.

493
01:02:02,511 --> 01:02:04,206
All right...

494
01:02:07,049 --> 01:02:09,609
Patrick, show me
what's in your pouch.

495
01:02:13,188 --> 01:02:15,019
Please.

496
01:02:17,826 --> 01:02:20,989
Patrick, show me
what's in your pouch.

497
01:02:30,506 --> 01:02:34,340
They're just plastic toys.
Plazteck people.

498
01:02:34,510 --> 01:02:38,037
- They're just completely plazteck.
- OK.

499
01:02:38,213 --> 01:02:41,546
- That's fine.
- Plazteck.

500
01:02:41,717 --> 01:02:45,949
- Yes. Thank you. Let me see.
- Plazteck.

501
01:02:48,390 --> 01:02:50,824
Let me see.

502
01:03:26,995 --> 01:03:29,828
They're just people.

503
01:03:34,169 --> 01:03:38,731
Why don't you two work this out?
But no more fighting, OK?

504
01:03:38,907 --> 01:03:42,536
- All right.
- Go catch up with your class.

505
01:04:01,396 --> 01:04:03,330
"It's just like having a child. "

506
01:04:03,932 --> 01:04:07,163
"Every time I'm away from him,
I worry that he's OK."

507
01:04:07,736 --> 01:04:09,727
"I come home and open the door"

508
01:04:09,905 --> 01:04:11,839
"and worry about what I will find. "

509
01:04:12,007 --> 01:04:15,465
"But he's a man.
I can't treat him like a baby. "

510
01:04:17,412 --> 01:04:19,403
Good. Sam.

511
01:04:20,182 --> 01:04:21,410
"JFK."

512
01:04:21,583 --> 01:04:25,349
"JFK was about
the youngest man ever president. "

513
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:28,318
"There were little kids
in the White House. "

514
01:04:30,959 --> 01:04:34,622
Mum, can Patrick
please spend the night?

515
01:04:34,796 --> 01:04:37,128
- Yeah, I think so.
- Spend the night?

516
01:04:37,299 --> 01:04:39,267
It's a wife.

517
01:04:41,136 --> 01:04:42,398
Excuse me.

518
01:04:42,571 --> 01:04:45,597
- That's great. Come on.
- Look at 'em.

519
01:05:14,603 --> 01:05:16,571
Who will she be?

520
01:05:17,706 --> 01:05:20,573
- What is that?
- It's a wife.

521
01:05:20,742 --> 01:05:25,270
A wife? My mother should
choose me a wife.

522
01:05:25,447 --> 01:05:27,881
But your mother's not here.

523
01:05:28,050 --> 01:05:32,248
I've been thinking about
settling down my own self.

524
01:05:41,930 --> 01:05:45,866
It's gone. The cupboard's gone.

525
01:05:48,236 --> 01:05:49,863
Who would take it?

526
01:05:56,311 --> 01:05:58,779
- Where is it?
- Where's what?

527
01:05:58,947 --> 01:06:02,383
- The cupboard, butt-head.
- Who gave you that cupboard?

528
01:06:02,551 --> 01:06:06,419
Please, where's the cupboard?
Gili, please.

529
01:06:06,588 --> 01:06:08,954
Where's my rat ball?

530
01:06:35,283 --> 01:06:37,444
Where? Please?

531
01:06:37,619 --> 01:06:39,814
In the crawlspace.

532
01:07:00,375 --> 01:07:02,138
Damn.

533
01:07:04,913 --> 01:07:08,872
The key! Where's the key?

534
01:07:09,050 --> 01:07:11,610
There was no key. I swear.

535
01:07:31,940 --> 01:07:36,240
You mean, we've got to live
here forever? Little like this?

536
01:07:36,411 --> 01:07:41,144
No new wife for Little Bear?
No baby? He needs a baby.

537
01:07:41,316 --> 01:07:43,341
I could look for another key.

538
01:07:45,487 --> 01:07:50,151
I want to go home. We've just got
the railroad coming through town

539
01:07:50,325 --> 01:07:52,987
and we've got a new doctor,
a good doctor.

540
01:07:53,161 --> 01:07:57,154
Hell, it's 1879. I'm living
at the dawn of a new century.

541
01:08:01,336 --> 01:08:03,804
Now I know what
you was talking about.

542
01:08:03,972 --> 01:08:07,237
God sure do play with men, all right.

543
01:08:07,409 --> 01:08:09,934
There is no god here.

544
01:08:23,525 --> 01:08:26,050
Come on, Gili!

545
01:08:28,263 --> 01:08:29,924
- Bye, Mum. Bye, Dad.
- Bye, guys.

546
01:08:30,098 --> 01:08:31,656
Bye, Mum.

547
01:09:11,106 --> 01:09:13,233
Disgusting display.

548
01:09:14,276 --> 01:09:16,744
They do this in front of you children?

549
01:09:16,912 --> 01:09:21,542
- It's not reaI.
- It's reaI all right. It's reaI.

550
01:09:21,716 --> 01:09:24,116
Let's change to
the Discovery ChanneI.

551
01:09:26,621 --> 01:09:30,022
<i>...roaming the great savannahs
of Africa.</i>

552
01:09:32,527 --> 01:09:34,722
Let me see that clicker.

553
01:09:46,808 --> 01:09:50,869
Apaches! The ugliest Redskins
that ever walked the earth!

554
01:09:56,685 --> 01:09:58,744
Get 'em, boys! Hell, yeah!

555
01:10:45,066 --> 01:10:48,524
Little Bear? Amigo?

556
01:11:43,992 --> 01:11:47,655
- He's alive.
- I wish we had Tommy.

557
01:11:48,897 --> 01:11:53,357
- You do not have the key.
- Can you take the arrow out?

558
01:11:56,071 --> 01:11:58,835
Blood will flow. Get me husks.

559
01:11:59,674 --> 01:12:01,198
We have no husks.

560
01:12:25,500 --> 01:12:27,297
Leave me.

561
01:12:43,585 --> 01:12:45,951
Boys?

562
01:12:48,690 --> 01:12:50,453
Time for bed.

563
01:12:50,625 --> 01:12:53,788
- Can you turn out the light, please?
- Sure.

564
01:12:58,233 --> 01:13:00,758
I feeI like I haven't seen you
in days.

565
01:13:00,935 --> 01:13:05,031
- Cartoon day tomorrow.
- I don't think we'll watch, thanks.

566
01:13:09,644 --> 01:13:11,737
- Good night.
- Good night, Mum.

567
01:13:11,913 --> 01:13:13,710
- Night, Patrick.
- Night, Janie.

568
01:13:13,882 --> 01:13:16,578
If you hear noises under the floor,
it's Gili's rat.

569
01:13:16,751 --> 01:13:19,117
- What?
- He escaped.

570
01:13:19,287 --> 01:13:22,779
Dad pulled up your floorboards
but he couldn't get him.

571
01:13:22,957 --> 01:13:24,754
That rat's under my floor?

572
01:13:24,926 --> 01:13:29,226
Maybe. He might have moved on.
If we're lucky, he moved out.

573
01:13:29,397 --> 01:13:31,490
- Oh, no.
- I know.

574
01:13:31,666 --> 01:13:33,600
Good night, guys.

575
01:13:42,844 --> 01:13:47,144
- Do you think he'll be OK?
- A rat will eat at a wounded man.

576
01:13:47,315 --> 01:13:50,580
Now we can't go to sleep at all.

577
01:13:52,153 --> 01:13:53,381
We'll take turns.

578
01:13:53,555 --> 01:13:56,991
If you go first,
I'll give you a million dollars.

579
01:15:00,455 --> 01:15:05,392
Wake up! I hear the rat! Get up!

580
01:15:40,828 --> 01:15:43,956
- It's the key!
- Get it!

581
01:15:44,132 --> 01:15:45,793
Hold this.

582
01:15:49,003 --> 01:15:51,062
Watch out.

583
01:16:06,688 --> 01:16:08,656
Oh, no!

584
01:16:09,357 --> 01:16:11,416
Let me go.

585
01:16:21,769 --> 01:16:25,671
I am too big. I am too big!

586
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:29,401
See if you can get under
that loose floorboard there.

587
01:16:32,380 --> 01:16:35,975
There's an animaI, a big animaI.
Move fast.

588
01:16:48,329 --> 01:16:51,264
Do you see a way? Is there a hole?

589
01:16:51,432 --> 01:16:53,900
Yes, I see one.

590
01:16:54,802 --> 01:16:56,736
- Omri?
- Yeah?

591
01:16:56,904 --> 01:17:00,533
- What are also dangers?
- Everything.

592
01:17:06,314 --> 01:17:09,374
Did he take his bow and arrow?
And his knife?

593
01:17:21,562 --> 01:17:23,029
Little Bear!

594
01:17:32,507 --> 01:17:34,134
Where is he?

595
01:17:39,113 --> 01:17:40,808
Little Bear!

596
01:17:48,022 --> 01:17:49,956
I hear him! Over there!

597
01:17:57,932 --> 01:18:00,526
- Where is he?
- Little Bear, come back.

598
01:18:24,625 --> 01:18:26,855
Come back, come back!

599
01:18:29,864 --> 01:18:32,230
- What was that?
- I don't know.

600
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:34,732
Please, Little Bear, come back.

601
01:18:34,902 --> 01:18:37,336
Why won't he come?

602
01:18:39,240 --> 01:18:41,208
<i>Omri?</i>

603
01:19:11,672 --> 01:19:13,731
I got him!

604
01:19:27,588 --> 01:19:28,953
It's you again.

605
01:19:31,292 --> 01:19:34,022
I do pick my moments to fall asleep.

606
01:19:34,195 --> 01:19:37,096
A great Minnie whining overhead.

607
01:19:37,265 --> 01:19:40,428
Thought I was a goner.
Perhaps I am a goner. Did I die?

608
01:19:40,601 --> 01:19:43,263
No. You're dreaming again.

609
01:19:48,142 --> 01:19:51,043
There's two of you now,
are there? Good show.

610
01:19:51,212 --> 01:19:54,045
Well, take me to him.
The elegant Injun?

611
01:19:54,215 --> 01:19:55,944
No, it's another.

612
01:20:05,059 --> 01:20:07,687
That's clever. Hello again.

613
01:20:09,130 --> 01:20:11,098
- The bleeding stopped.
- Yes. Good.

614
01:20:11,265 --> 01:20:14,166
He needs a blood transfusion,
but I'm not prepared for that.

615
01:20:16,070 --> 01:20:19,471
- A bullet, was it?
- Arrow.

616
01:20:20,942 --> 01:20:23,001
Lucky it missed his heart and lung.

617
01:20:29,584 --> 01:20:31,711
The cotton's damp.

618
01:20:33,087 --> 01:20:36,181
So, you're a paI of his, are you?

619
01:20:37,792 --> 01:20:39,350
Amigo.

620
01:21:00,248 --> 01:21:02,944
That should just about do it.

621
01:21:03,117 --> 01:21:07,019
Look, keep a close watch on him.
Plenty of water.

622
01:21:07,188 --> 01:21:09,588
He could use a doctor's care.

623
01:21:14,295 --> 01:21:16,024
There's a doctor in his town.

624
01:21:18,866 --> 01:21:21,892
- No.
- When he wakes up.

625
01:21:22,069 --> 01:21:23,627
Not yet.

626
01:21:29,210 --> 01:21:31,235
It's time for them to go home.

627
01:21:32,647 --> 01:21:35,616
Good. That will do.
He needs to sleep.

628
01:21:35,783 --> 01:21:38,980
Well, I best be getting back.

629
01:21:39,153 --> 01:21:42,554
We'll all be waking up soon enough.
I suggest a drop of brandy.

630
01:21:44,425 --> 01:21:47,724
- Thank you.
- You're welcome, mate.

631
01:21:47,895 --> 01:21:50,864
Buckles keep catching on my doodah.

632
01:22:08,316 --> 01:22:10,079
Omri!

633
01:22:19,493 --> 01:22:21,825
I'm so ashamed of myself.

634
01:22:28,736 --> 01:22:30,863
I hurt you.

635
01:22:31,038 --> 01:22:33,836
What are you talking about?

636
01:22:38,145 --> 01:22:40,511
Did I hear somebody mention brandy?

637
01:23:35,236 --> 01:23:37,500
No, Omri.

638
01:23:37,671 --> 01:23:40,139
She has her life.

639
01:23:40,307 --> 01:23:43,140
She has a family, a clan.

640
01:23:44,612 --> 01:23:46,546
Maybe a husband and a child.

641
01:23:47,515 --> 01:23:50,177
I don't want you to be alone.

642
01:23:50,351 --> 01:23:52,785
I will be with my people.

643
01:24:03,464 --> 01:24:05,728
I will be with you
when the sun rises?

644
01:24:07,601 --> 01:24:09,262
One more time.

645
01:24:50,945 --> 01:24:53,778
Hey, son. When we go back,

646
01:24:53,948 --> 01:24:57,247
are we going back to the last
thing we remember or ahead?

647
01:24:57,418 --> 01:24:59,716
I don't know.

648
01:25:00,354 --> 01:25:02,948
I hope it's forwards.
How about you, Little Bear?

649
01:25:03,123 --> 01:25:05,683
Little Bear, where are you headed?

650
01:25:07,328 --> 01:25:09,888
I was on the journey
with my brother's son.

651
01:25:10,064 --> 01:25:12,225
I think I will wake up in the woods.

652
01:25:12,399 --> 01:25:16,802
It is quiet
and the nights are getting cold.

653
01:25:16,971 --> 01:25:19,462
I can almost smell the trees.

654
01:25:20,875 --> 01:25:24,675
I can almost smell them, too.
Like I'm part Indian now my own self.

655
01:25:26,313 --> 01:25:29,476
If you were my nephew, it'd be
time to walk you through the forest.

656
01:25:29,650 --> 01:25:30,912
I would go.

657
01:25:49,203 --> 01:25:51,330
It is difficult.

658
01:25:53,707 --> 01:25:56,198
You would live by yourself,

659
01:25:56,377 --> 01:25:58,709
care for yourself.

660
01:26:32,980 --> 01:26:37,440
We would traveI for days,
tell stories,

661
01:26:37,618 --> 01:26:39,518
hunt and fish.

662
01:26:40,521 --> 01:26:43,046
I'd leave you and return
to the village.

663
01:26:43,223 --> 01:26:45,418
You must live alone for one season.

664
01:26:45,593 --> 01:26:49,051
You would learn to live in harmony
with Mother Nature...

665
01:26:49,229 --> 01:26:53,928
...the two-legged,
the four-legged, the winged.

666
01:26:55,102 --> 01:26:57,662
When the seasons change,

667
01:26:57,838 --> 01:27:00,204
my nephew would come home.

668
01:27:02,009 --> 01:27:05,536
- I would be waiting for you.
- Little Bear...

669
01:27:05,713 --> 01:27:08,238
We would have a great celebration

670
01:27:08,415 --> 01:27:11,646
because you return
to the village... as a man.

671
01:27:39,480 --> 01:27:41,778
When I leave you, Omri,

672
01:27:41,949 --> 01:27:45,612
I take you... as my nephew.

673
01:27:56,797 --> 01:27:58,128
Time to go, gentlemen.

674
01:28:02,069 --> 01:28:04,799
Easy, Darlin'. Easy, now.

675
01:28:04,972 --> 01:28:07,304
Don't y'all forget me.

676
01:28:08,942 --> 01:28:10,671
I won't.

677
01:28:12,713 --> 01:28:15,375
You look after yourself now,
Little Bear.

678
01:28:20,487 --> 01:28:22,978
And you, friend.

679
01:28:26,427 --> 01:28:29,521
- Goodbye, my friendly giants.
- Great Spirit?

680
01:28:29,697 --> 01:28:32,427
Yes, Little Bear?

681
01:28:32,599 --> 01:28:38,697
Tell me about the Onondaga gah.
Are we always a great people?

682
01:28:38,872 --> 01:28:41,272
You are always a great people...

683
01:28:45,646 --> 01:28:48,376
...but it's not always so good.

684
01:28:50,384 --> 01:28:55,151
- Things change for us?
- They will.

685
01:28:59,159 --> 01:29:00,990
We go.

686
01:29:23,217 --> 01:29:25,276
Now!

687
01:30:19,706 --> 01:30:22,937
"I will never know
where he is or how he is"

688
01:30:23,110 --> 01:30:25,271
"but I don't worry
about him any more. "

689
01:30:26,013 --> 01:30:28,277
"I think Little Bear
will have lots of children"

690
01:30:28,448 --> 01:30:31,383
"and he will teach them everything. "

691
01:30:31,552 --> 01:30:34,646
"He will always
take care of his people. "

692
01:30:36,123 --> 01:30:37,385

01:30:45,199 --> 01:30:47,394
"One day JFK was killed. "

696
01:30:47,568 --> 01:30:50,002
"He was shot on a street in Texas. "

697
01:30:50,170 --> 01:30:54,607
"My grandpa says that he
remembers exactly where he was... "
