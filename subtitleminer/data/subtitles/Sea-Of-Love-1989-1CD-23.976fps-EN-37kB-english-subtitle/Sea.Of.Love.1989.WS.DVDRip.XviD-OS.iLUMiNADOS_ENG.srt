6
00:02:25,437 --> 00:02:28,232
<i>When we met </i>

7
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:30,692
<i>That's the day </i>

8
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:33,529
<i>I knew you were my pet </i>

9
00:02:33,612 --> 00:02:36,281
<i>I want to tell you </i>

10
00:02:36,365 --> 00:02:42,579

11
00:02:44,957 --> 00:02:50,462

<i>Do you remember </i>

16
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:06,770
Oh, baby.

17
00:03:06,812 --> 00:03:09,606
Oh, baby.

18
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:11,567
Okay?

19
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:13,735
I can't...

20
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:15,988
Is this okay?

21
00:03:16,947 --> 00:03:20,242
Is this okay?
Is this okay...

22
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:36,216
I.D. S, fellows.

23
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:39,636
Invites, guys, invites.

24
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:44,057
Invites and I.D. S, guys,
invites and I.D.s.

25
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:46,059
I.D. S, fellas.

26
00:03:46,143 --> 00:03:49,271
Invites and I.D. S, fellas.

27
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:51,315
Welcome to the Yankees.

28
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:54,234
All right,
go on in, young man.

29
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:58,488
<i>Welcome to the Third Annual</i>
<i>Meet the Yankees Breakfast.</i>

30
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:02,326
<i>Have a seat, fellas.</i>
<i>The Yankees will be here soon.</i>

31
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:04,995
Hey, yo, Frank.

32
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,705
Yo, David.

33
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:16,798
- How you guys doing?
- Yo, bro. Where the Yankees at?

34
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:20,427
- Oh, they're coming.
- You a Yankee?

35
00:04:20,511 --> 00:04:23,388
- You don't recognize me?
- Shortstop?

36
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,266
- Used to be.
- What?

37
00:04:27,351 --> 00:04:30,771
Sure. Holy cow!

38
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:32,606
- I thought so.
- You're the Scooter!

39
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:36,777
Yo, Efram, this dude
is Phil Rizzuto.

40
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,362
Do that again.

41
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:40,864
Holy cow!

42
00:04:40,906 --> 00:04:43,784
Phil, how come
you pouring us juice?

43
00:04:43,867 --> 00:04:46,286
How we get to the game?

44
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:47,746
We got you covered.

45
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:49,248
Yanks up in here?

46
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:51,875
- Oh, yeah.
- All right. Bust it out.

47
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:56,088
Yo, Scooter.

48
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:57,673
Scooter!

49
00:04:57,756 --> 00:04:58,966
Scooter.

50
00:05:00,592 --> 00:05:02,052
Hey, hey, I'm good.

51
00:05:02,094 --> 00:05:04,179
Get some food.
Go ahead.

52
00:05:11,103 --> 00:05:12,604
Okay, fellas.

53
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:17,067
I got good news,
and I got bad news.

54
00:05:17,109 --> 00:05:18,610
Which you want first?

55
00:05:18,694 --> 00:05:20,404
Good news, good news!

56
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:23,323
Fuck that. Give up
the bad news, homeboy.

57
00:05:23,407 --> 00:05:25,033
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

58
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,537
Bad news wins.

59
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:33,125
Uh, the Yanks
can't make it here, guys.

60
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:37,379
You can't go
to the stadium.

61
00:05:38,881 --> 00:05:41,758
We got 45
outstanding warrants...

62
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:44,219
eating our pancakes here.

63
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:47,222
On behalf of
the New York Yankees...

64
00:05:47,264 --> 00:05:51,059
and the New York City
Career Criminals Investigation Unit...

65
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:53,312
you are all under arrest.

66
00:05:59,568 --> 00:06:02,446
Sorry, guys.
We got you.

67
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:03,864
What's the good news?

68
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:05,782
Good news is coming around.

69
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:10,996
Yo! Yo!

70
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,873
Excuse me.

71
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:15,709
I'd like to
propose a toast.

72
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:18,545
Hold it.

73
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:21,089
To Detective Frank Keller...

74
00:06:21,173 --> 00:06:24,635
on today, his 20th anniversary
on the job.

75
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:26,803
- Sit down!
- Boo!

76
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:31,975
I can't believe
you're not retiring.

77
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:35,020
I get 20 years,
I'm history.

78
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:36,480
Take half my pay...

79
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:40,317
Open a motel, a bar,
a polygraph school.

80
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,861
I'm going
to be 46 years old...

81
00:06:42,945 --> 00:06:46,240
sticking my pencil in some dead skull
looking for a bullet?

82
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:47,783
Nothing wrong with motels.

83
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:49,243
I'll come visit you.

84
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:50,327
Yeah, sure.

85
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,246
Anyway, congratulations.

86
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,294
Hey, am I too late?

87
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:00,754
Got an invitation?

88
00:07:00,838 --> 00:07:02,422
Yeah.

89
00:07:03,674 --> 00:07:04,842
Who's this?

90
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:06,343
That's my son.

91
00:07:06,385 --> 00:07:09,263
Ernest Lee, the invitation's
for you only.

92
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:11,807
I can hardly meet
Dave Winfield...

93
00:07:11,849 --> 00:07:13,225
without taking my boy.

94
00:07:14,518 --> 00:07:16,311
You got I.D., Ernest?

95
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:17,771
Yeah.

96
00:07:17,855 --> 00:07:19,982
Grand theft auto...

97
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:22,359
two counts.

98
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:26,989
We're all booked up, Ernest.

99
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:29,408
Hey, I got an invite.

100
00:07:29,491 --> 00:07:31,869
I said we're all booked up.

101
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:35,497
Thanks, man.

102
00:07:35,539 --> 00:07:37,624
Catch you later.

103
00:08:42,064 --> 00:08:43,774
Gruber.

104
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:45,567
Frank Keller.

105
00:08:45,609 --> 00:08:47,236
How you doing?

106
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:50,906
I wake you?

107
00:08:50,948 --> 00:08:55,911
Could I... Could I speak
with my wife, please?

108
00:08:55,994 --> 00:08:57,621
Yeah, my ex-wife.

109
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,963
Denise. How you doing?

110
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:08,465
I wake you?

111
00:09:08,549 --> 00:09:10,384
I wake you?

112
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:12,636
Oh, I'm sorry. Listen...

113
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:15,764
I got to talk to you.

114
00:09:15,848 --> 00:09:17,808
I think...

115
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:20,602
I got appendicitis.

116
00:09:23,397 --> 00:09:24,815
Hello?

117
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:27,317
Hello?

118
00:09:36,118 --> 00:09:38,328
<i>Do you remember </i>

119
00:09:38,412 --> 00:09:41,081
<i>When we met </i>

120
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:43,500

121
00:09:43,584 --> 00:09:46,420
<i>I knew you were my pet </i>

122
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:49,173
<i>I want to tell you </i>

123
00:09:49,256 --> 00:09:55,262
<i>How much I love you </i>

124
00:10:19,703 --> 00:10:21,747
<i> Come with me </i>

125
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:24,708
<i>My love </i>

126
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,043
Mr. Mackey!

127
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:27,544
<i>To the sea </i>

128
00:10:27,586 --> 00:10:30,464
<i>The sea oflove </i>

129
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:33,342

130
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:38,764

00:10:41,892 --> 00:10:43,310
<i>Do you remember </i>

132
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:44,645
Mr. Mackey?

133
00:11:06,917 --> 00:11:08,544
Thank you, Chief.

134
00:11:08,627 --> 00:11:11,046
- Where's it at?
- 18F.

135
00:11:11,088 --> 00:11:13,590
- Anybody talk to you?
- No one of weight.

136
00:11:13,674 --> 00:11:16,593
No one of weight?
You ever on the job?

137
00:11:16,635 --> 00:11:18,220
Me?

138
00:11:18,303 --> 00:11:20,264
I'm just a square badge.

139
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:21,723
I was in Korea.

140
00:11:21,765 --> 00:11:24,726
Yeah? I thought
you were on the job.

141
00:11:24,768 --> 00:11:27,020
Listen, we'll talk later, okay?

142
00:11:27,104 --> 00:11:28,564
I'm of weight.

143
00:11:36,697 --> 00:11:38,615
"You ever on the job?"

144
00:11:38,699 --> 00:11:40,576
Oh, shit.

145
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:44,246
It's called making
people feel good...

146
00:11:44,288 --> 00:11:46,415
so they'll cooperate with you.

147
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:49,543
You should try it sometime.

148
00:11:57,551 --> 00:12:01,638
I'm sorry about
that phone thing last night.

149
00:12:01,722 --> 00:12:04,057
I'm having a mid-life crisis.

150
00:12:04,141 --> 00:12:07,060
I don't want you
calling at 3 A.M.

151
00:12:07,144 --> 00:12:09,813
Call Denise at decent hours.

152
00:12:09,897 --> 00:12:11,815
Decent hours?
What's that?

153
00:12:11,857 --> 00:12:14,193
9 A.M. To what...

154
00:12:14,276 --> 00:12:16,361
Dinnertime? 8 P.M.?

155
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:26,788
I can't believe those guys.

156
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:28,874
You never saw Joe Louis.

157
00:12:28,957 --> 00:12:30,417
In the bedroom.

158
00:12:30,501 --> 00:12:32,920
Louis? Where did you see him?

159
00:12:33,003 --> 00:12:34,630
Way before you were born.

160
00:12:34,671 --> 00:12:37,466
Joe Louis.

161
00:12:37,508 --> 00:12:40,010
They called him
the Brown Bomber.

162
00:12:40,052 --> 00:12:41,470
He was gorgeous.

163
00:12:41,512 --> 00:12:44,014
You want to take
the lady outside?

164
00:12:44,056 --> 00:12:46,475
Getting a little
crowded in here.

165
00:12:46,517 --> 00:12:48,268
Your prints, too, Chief.

166
00:13:00,822 --> 00:13:02,533
So, what's
this guy's name?

167
00:13:02,616 --> 00:13:04,826
James...

168
00:13:07,204 --> 00:13:08,830
Mackey.

169
00:13:10,207 --> 00:13:11,667
Mack the Knife.

170
00:13:22,803 --> 00:13:23,971
You know...

171
00:13:24,054 --> 00:13:27,224
when she was
married to me...

172
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:29,726
I was never going to die.

173
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:32,521
We fight, we split...

174
00:13:32,563 --> 00:13:33,981
she goes to you.

175
00:13:35,274 --> 00:13:38,193
So it goes.
Life is forever, right?

176
00:13:38,235 --> 00:13:39,736
What do I care?

177
00:13:39,778 --> 00:13:42,781
I passed my 20 yesterday.

178
00:13:42,865 --> 00:13:44,867
Everybody says retire...

179
00:13:44,908 --> 00:13:46,535
so...

180
00:13:46,577 --> 00:13:49,538
I feel mortal
all of a sudden.

181
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:51,540
Know what I mean?

182
00:13:51,582 --> 00:13:54,042
I say he's dead 48 hours.

183
00:13:54,084 --> 00:13:55,502
No.

184
00:13:55,586 --> 00:13:57,004
Look at the lividity.

185
00:13:57,087 --> 00:13:58,213
It's more like 36.

186
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:01,091
Smells like 48.

187
00:14:02,259 --> 00:14:03,552
Smells like 36.

188
00:14:07,264 --> 00:14:11,059
I was just trying to
get some attention.

189
00:14:11,143 --> 00:14:12,477
You know?

190
00:14:12,561 --> 00:14:13,729
I apologize.

191
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:20,319
It was just...

192
00:14:21,612 --> 00:14:23,530
we're in the same squad...

193
00:14:23,614 --> 00:14:25,616
six years.

194
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:26,742
Huh?

195
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:30,787
We don't so much as have
a beer together.

196
00:14:30,871 --> 00:14:34,291
How the hell do you
take my wife away?

197
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:35,792
Hey...

198
00:14:37,878 --> 00:14:39,796
I didn't take
nobody nowhere.

199
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,131
You understand?

200
00:14:41,215 --> 00:14:44,092
You didn't treat her right.
She walked.

201
00:14:44,134 --> 00:14:46,136
I didn't treat her right?

202
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,429
She walked.

203
00:14:47,471 --> 00:14:50,474
You want to kick
somebody's ass about it...

204
00:14:50,516 --> 00:14:51,808
you kick your own.

205
00:14:53,227 --> 00:14:54,811
Fuckface.

206
00:14:57,814 --> 00:15:00,317
I'll check everybody out,
but truthfully...

207
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,611
it boils down to grabbing
the strange trim...

208
00:15:02,653 --> 00:15:04,655
he got hooked up with.

209
00:15:04,655 --> 00:15:07,157
This guy's a swordsman
extraordinaire.

210
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:09,910
Could be a lady
gets pissed off...

211
00:15:09,993 --> 00:15:12,496
because they're in bed, he's...

212
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:15,332
Starts moaning Mary
instead of Gladys.

213
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:19,920
Hell hath no fury
and all that.

214
00:15:20,003 --> 00:15:22,965
How do you know
the trim is strange?

215
00:15:23,048 --> 00:15:24,591
Maybe it's a steady.

216
00:15:24,675 --> 00:15:27,594
Strange. Know how I know?
Records... 45s.

217
00:15:27,678 --> 00:15:29,555
Nobody whips out old 45s...

218
00:15:29,638 --> 00:15:32,099
except on
first or second dates.

219
00:15:32,182 --> 00:15:35,561
Getting to know you,
so what do you do?

220
00:15:35,644 --> 00:15:37,104
Take out old records...

221
00:15:37,187 --> 00:15:39,022
show the broad
you kept them...

222
00:15:39,106 --> 00:15:41,567
meaning you're
a sentimental individual.

223
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:44,570
Who does that
with somebody they know?

224
00:15:44,653 --> 00:15:46,613
Once you know them,
who gives a shit?

225
00:15:57,666 --> 00:15:59,084
How you doing, Chief?

226
00:15:59,168 --> 00:16:02,546
Hey, working hard
or hardly working?

227
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:05,048
Little of both.
How you doing?

228
00:16:05,132 --> 00:16:07,384
- Okay.
- You think of anybody else?

229
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:10,095
Maybe the mailman
in the afternoon.

230
00:16:10,137 --> 00:16:11,847
I don't remember.

231
00:16:11,889 --> 00:16:13,849
There's a cable TV repairman.

232
00:16:13,891 --> 00:16:15,309
What's that, Cabletime?

233
00:16:15,392 --> 00:16:18,854
But he was down
in the basement.

234
00:16:18,937 --> 00:16:22,399
Pretty much what
I told you yesterday.

235
00:16:22,441 --> 00:16:24,026
What about ladies?

236
00:16:24,067 --> 00:16:26,153
See any young ladies?

237
00:16:26,236 --> 00:16:27,779
See any of them?

238
00:16:27,863 --> 00:16:30,782
You told me
there was a sex parade.

239
00:16:30,866 --> 00:16:34,786
If I'm looking to see somebody
in particular, I'll see them.

240
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:37,831
But if I'm hailing a cab
or in the package room...

241
00:16:37,873 --> 00:16:40,459
Okay. We'll talk again.

242
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:44,755
So the emcee says
to the first husband...

243
00:16:44,838 --> 00:16:46,757
"Where did your wife say...

244
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:50,260
was the most exotic place
you ever made love?"

245
00:16:50,344 --> 00:16:52,304
So this guy's thinking, right?

246
00:16:52,387 --> 00:16:55,307
He's got a brain
like a frigging pea...

247
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:56,808
but he's thinking.

248
00:16:56,892 --> 00:16:59,436
Finally he says,
"In the butt".

249
00:17:01,063 --> 00:17:02,481
You get it?

250
00:17:02,564 --> 00:17:04,483
Hey, anybody do any work...

251
00:17:04,566 --> 00:17:07,402
over at 365
West End Avenue Monday?

252
00:17:07,444 --> 00:17:08,570
I did.

253
00:17:08,654 --> 00:17:11,073
See anybody there
not looking right?

254
00:17:11,114 --> 00:17:13,825
You know...
freaked out, scared?

255
00:17:13,909 --> 00:17:15,577
Running like lost?

256
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:18,789
I saw some ladies
in the laundry room.

257
00:17:18,872 --> 00:17:20,332
Why? What happened?

258
00:17:20,415 --> 00:17:21,834
There was a shooting.

259
00:17:21,917 --> 00:17:24,545
If you remember,
want to give me a call?

260
00:17:24,628 --> 00:17:27,214
- Yeah, sure.
- Thank you.

261
00:17:37,307 --> 00:17:39,142
<i>Mmm </i>

262
00:17:39,226 --> 00:17:43,021
<i>Mmm </i>

263
00:17:43,105 --> 00:17:46,316
<i>Mmm </i>

264
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,902
<i>Mmm </i>

265
00:17:48,986 --> 00:17:50,487
<i>Mmm </i>

266
00:17:50,529 --> 00:17:51,530
<i>Mmm </i>

267
00:17:51,613 --> 00:17:54,783
<i>Mmm </i>

268
00:17:54,867 --> 00:17:57,327
<i>Come with me </i>

269
00:17:57,369 --> 00:17:59,830
<i>My love </i>

270
00:17:59,872 --> 00:18:02,916
<i>To the sea </i>

271
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:10,382
It's so good.
It's so good.

272
00:18:10,465 --> 00:18:12,634
It feels so good.

273
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:15,846
Please. Please...

274
00:18:22,186 --> 00:18:24,688
- Excuse me.
- Hey! A toast.

275
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:25,772
Excuse me.

276
00:18:25,856 --> 00:18:28,609
For our host.
10 promotions, overdue.

277
00:18:28,692 --> 00:18:30,027
Meet your detectives.

278
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:34,031
Tommy Squibb,
detective third grade.

279
00:18:34,114 --> 00:18:37,409
Felix King,
detective third grade.

280
00:18:37,492 --> 00:18:41,663
Joe Pines,
detective third grade.

281
00:18:43,207 --> 00:18:44,458
Hey, fellas!

282
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:49,338
Come on,
I'm giving a toast here.

283
00:18:52,132 --> 00:18:53,884
Tommy Squibb,
detective third grade.

284
00:18:53,967 --> 00:18:55,928
All right, George.

285
00:18:56,011 --> 00:18:57,930
Where do you learn that?

286
00:18:58,013 --> 00:18:59,932
That's like
watching a movie.

287
00:19:00,015 --> 00:19:02,434
Yeah, well,
it keeps me fit.

288
00:19:02,518 --> 00:19:05,437
I get in a beef
with a guy...

289
00:19:05,521 --> 00:19:08,440
I hit him fast,
I'm out of there.

290
00:19:08,524 --> 00:19:10,442
I don't like getting hurt.

291
00:19:10,526 --> 00:19:14,863
God gave fat guys guns
to handle that. You Frank Keller?

292
00:19:14,905 --> 00:19:17,866
- Sherman Touhey from the 112.
- Forest Hills?

293
00:19:17,908 --> 00:19:20,494
I heard you caught
a good one...

294
00:19:20,577 --> 00:19:22,704
face-down taxpayer,
back of the head?

295
00:19:22,746 --> 00:19:25,541
- Me, too, on Yellowstone Boulevard.
- No shit?

296
00:19:25,582 --> 00:19:29,086
The bullet's no use.
Pancaked on the bed frame.

297
00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:32,089
We got cigarette butts
with lipstick on them.

298
00:19:32,172 --> 00:19:34,049
We didn't get any butts.

299
00:19:34,091 --> 00:19:35,175
Any prints?

300
00:19:35,259 --> 00:19:38,095
Yeah, nothing showed up
on the files, though.

301
00:19:38,178 --> 00:19:39,763
Let's compare tomorrow.

302
00:19:47,604 --> 00:19:50,566
Uh, Dewars, double Dewars
on the rocks.

303
00:19:50,607 --> 00:19:51,942
Budweiser.

304
00:19:52,025 --> 00:19:54,069
You know something?
You talk lipstick...

305
00:19:54,152 --> 00:19:57,573
I think my guy
got done by a broad.

306
00:19:57,614 --> 00:19:59,074
Oh, yeah?
How's that?

307
00:19:59,116 --> 00:20:01,577
We're talking
four-star ladies man here.

308
00:20:01,618 --> 00:20:04,580
Hey, you play, you pay.
Am I right?

309
00:20:04,621 --> 00:20:07,082
My wedding night,
I wake up...

310
00:20:07,124 --> 00:20:10,586
my wife's got the tattoo needle,
the eyeshades.

311
00:20:10,627 --> 00:20:12,880
I got "property of"
on my balls.

312
00:20:12,963 --> 00:20:15,215
Only kidding,
but catch my drift?

313
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:18,051
This guy, I found letters
from singles magazines...

314
00:20:18,135 --> 00:20:20,095
he placed an ad in.

315
00:20:20,137 --> 00:20:22,055
He didn't open
any envelopes.

316
00:20:22,139 --> 00:20:24,057
You find any records there?

317
00:20:24,141 --> 00:20:26,560
What do you mean,
like files?

318
00:20:26,643 --> 00:20:29,271
Records, like old records, 45s.

319
00:20:29,354 --> 00:20:31,815
One was playing
on the turntable.

320
00:20:31,899 --> 00:20:32,941
<i>Sea of Love.</i>

321
00:20:32,983 --> 00:20:35,110
Remember that one?

322
00:20:35,194 --> 00:20:37,571
<i>Sea of Love.</i>
Jesus.

323
00:20:37,654 --> 00:20:41,074
Come with me, my love

324
00:20:41,158 --> 00:20:42,784
To the sea

325
00:20:42,826 --> 00:20:44,995
The sea of love

326
00:20:45,078 --> 00:20:46,330
I

327
00:20:46,413 --> 00:20:48,123
Wanna tell you

328
00:20:48,165 --> 00:20:50,667
How much

329
00:20:50,709 --> 00:20:53,378
I love you

330
00:20:53,462 --> 00:20:54,546
Yeah.

331
00:20:56,757 --> 00:20:59,551
Do you remember

332
00:20:59,635 --> 00:21:02,638
When we met

333
00:21:02,721 --> 00:21:05,307
That's the day

334
00:21:05,349 --> 00:21:08,352
I knew you were my pet

335
00:21:08,393 --> 00:21:11,438
I wanna tell you

336
00:21:11,522 --> 00:21:13,232
How much

337
00:21:13,315 --> 00:21:15,192
I love you

338
00:21:15,275 --> 00:21:18,153
Do do do do
Do do do do

339
00:21:18,195 --> 00:21:20,656
- Something's got to come off.
- That's it?

340
00:21:20,697 --> 00:21:23,659
- You got to take something off.
- I...

341
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,702
- Yeah!
- All right!

342
00:21:25,744 --> 00:21:27,829
Come on, take it off!

343
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:32,167
I just met this guy.

344
00:21:32,251 --> 00:21:35,921
Actually,
I admire this woman...

345
00:21:36,004 --> 00:21:39,299
whoever she is,
for her directness.

346
00:21:39,383 --> 00:21:43,303
I mean, the guy
fucks around on her...

347
00:21:43,387 --> 00:21:47,349
falls asleep... whatever... Bingo!

348
00:21:47,391 --> 00:21:49,852
Pop him in the head,
it's over.

349
00:21:49,893 --> 00:21:53,313
Other women, like my ex-wife
Denise, for example...

350
00:21:53,397 --> 00:21:55,858
you step out of line
a little...

351
00:21:55,899 --> 00:21:58,193
she'd like to stick it here,
stick it there...

352
00:21:58,235 --> 00:22:00,821
let you
walk around bleeding.

353
00:22:00,863 --> 00:22:04,324
This one, bingo!
No muss, no fuss.

354
00:22:04,408 --> 00:22:06,827
Evelyn Woods School
of Speed Revenge.

355
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:08,328
No walking wounded.

356
00:22:08,412 --> 00:22:12,207
Oh... fuckin' women!

357
00:22:12,249 --> 00:22:14,918
Hey, Grube,
let me ask you something.

358
00:22:15,002 --> 00:22:18,213
Your wife, does she
stick it to you?

359
00:22:19,339 --> 00:22:22,259
So what are you
trying to say to me?

360
00:22:22,301 --> 00:22:24,219
You're a happily
married man.

361
00:22:25,429 --> 00:22:28,223
Maybe Gruber's too busy
sticking it into her...

362
00:22:28,265 --> 00:22:31,268
to notice when she's
sticking it into him.

363
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:40,360
Guys, break it up!
Break it up!

364
00:22:41,612 --> 00:22:44,531
Are you okay?
He's crazy. Let's go.

365
00:22:44,615 --> 00:22:46,408
Let's go, let's go.

366
00:24:20,752 --> 00:24:22,212
Fuck it.

367
00:25:17,601 --> 00:25:19,394
"Silver moons...

368
00:25:19,436 --> 00:25:22,356
a lifetime of Junes,
old rock tunes."

369
00:25:22,439 --> 00:25:24,733
Who the hell are you?

370
00:25:28,403 --> 00:25:29,446
Oh, wait a minute.

371
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:33,116
Uh... what's my name?

372
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,701
This isn't funny.

373
00:25:34,785 --> 00:25:36,245
What's my name?

374
00:25:38,497 --> 00:25:40,374
Jim Mackey.

375
00:25:42,459 --> 00:25:45,963
So you answered his ad
in <i>New York Weekly,</i> huh?

376
00:25:46,046 --> 00:25:47,297
Uh-huh.

377
00:25:51,051 --> 00:25:53,470
I don't know
why I'm crying.

378
00:25:53,554 --> 00:25:56,473
I never even
got to meet him.

379
00:25:56,515 --> 00:25:59,268
It's just so sad,
somebody dying.

380
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:03,605
So you wrote him,
or you called him?

381
00:26:03,689 --> 00:26:05,732
I wrote him...

382
00:26:05,816 --> 00:26:08,151
and then he called me.

383
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:15,325
Fate sucks, I swear.

384
00:26:15,409 --> 00:26:19,079
Hey, Gina, maybe
you'd feel better...

385
00:26:19,162 --> 00:26:22,624
if you took
those balloons off.

386
00:26:22,708 --> 00:26:25,752
They're the only things
keeping me up.

387
00:26:43,896 --> 00:26:45,647
Frank.

388
00:26:45,731 --> 00:26:49,443
The lieutenant said I could
read the jacket on your case.

389
00:26:49,526 --> 00:26:51,445
Guess what?
The prints match.

390
00:26:51,528 --> 00:26:53,989
The same doer.
Ain't that grand?

391
00:26:54,072 --> 00:26:56,992
Well, I got one for you,
my man.

392
00:26:57,034 --> 00:27:00,495
Your guy put an ad
in a singles magazine?

393
00:27:00,537 --> 00:27:01,997
<i>New York Weekly.</i>

394
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:03,498
Bingo to that.

395
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:05,459
My guy's in there, too.

396
00:27:05,542 --> 00:27:08,504
"Silver balloons,
endless Junes...

397
00:27:08,587 --> 00:27:09,922

00:27:10,005 --> 00:27:12,925
"let me put it
in your moon.

399
00:27:13,008 --> 00:27:15,469
Wire palladin."
Something like that.

400
00:27:15,552 --> 00:27:16,929
Want to hear my guy?

401
00:27:17,012 --> 00:27:19,473
"City streets
beneath my feet...

402
00:27:19,556 --> 00:27:21,683

404

for love,
the rarest flower."

405
00:27:27,731 --> 00:27:30,734
This lady,
she's in the crosshairs.

406
00:27:30,776 --> 00:27:32,236
Poetry lover.

407
00:27:32,277 --> 00:27:34,696
More like she hates it.

408
00:27:34,738 --> 00:27:38,200
Listen, I had my lieu
talk to your lieu...

409
00:27:38,242 --> 00:27:41,245
and we're
a two-man task force.

410
00:27:41,328 --> 00:27:42,746
What do you think?

411
00:27:42,829 --> 00:27:45,082
Queens or here?

412
00:27:45,165 --> 00:27:48,252
You fucking kidding me?
I'd kill to work in Manhattan.

413
00:27:48,335 --> 00:27:49,878
You want to work in Queens?

414
00:27:51,171 --> 00:27:53,090
Let me introduce you around.

415
00:27:53,173 --> 00:27:54,591
I'll catch them tomorrow.

416
00:27:54,675 --> 00:27:57,594
I got a tuxedo fitting
in an hour.

417
00:27:57,678 --> 00:27:59,096
Got a lounge act?

418
00:27:59,137 --> 00:28:01,139
My daughter's getting
married Sunday.

419
00:28:01,223 --> 00:28:02,683
Hey, you like weddings?

420
00:28:04,852 --> 00:28:06,854
Steve walks warily
down the street

421
00:28:06,937 --> 00:28:09,189
With the brim
pulled way down low

422
00:28:09,273 --> 00:28:11,066
Ain't no sound
but the sound of his feet

423
00:28:11,149 --> 00:28:14,528
Machine guns ready to go
Are you ready

424
00:28:14,611 --> 00:28:15,737
Are you ready for this

425
00:28:15,821 --> 00:28:17,948
Are you hangin' on
the edge of your seat

426
00:28:18,031 --> 00:28:20,242
Out of the doorway
the bullets rip

427
00:28:20,325 --> 00:28:22,578
To the sound of the beat

428
00:28:24,663 --> 00:28:26,915
Another one bites the dust

429
00:28:28,917 --> 00:28:31,753
Another one bites the dust

430
00:28:31,795 --> 00:28:33,922
And another one gone
and another one gone

431
00:28:34,006 --> 00:28:35,757
And another one
bites the dust

432
00:28:35,799 --> 00:28:37,634
Hey, I'm gonna get you, too

433
00:28:37,718 --> 00:28:40,095
Another one bites the dust

434
00:28:42,222 --> 00:28:43,682
Another one bites the dust

435
00:28:43,765 --> 00:28:44,933
Yeah

436
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:48,687
Another one bites the dust

437
00:28:50,689 --> 00:28:53,066
Another one bites the dust

438
00:29:06,455 --> 00:29:07,539
Whoo!

439
00:29:10,334 --> 00:29:12,252
Want to dance with
a couple bridesmaids?

440
00:29:12,336 --> 00:29:15,255
Okay. Want to know
how we catch her?

441
00:29:15,339 --> 00:29:17,758
We put in our own ad.

442
00:29:17,841 --> 00:29:19,009
Say what?

443
00:29:19,092 --> 00:29:22,346
<i>New York Weekly</i> magazine.
We put our own ad in.

444
00:29:22,429 --> 00:29:25,349
100 guys place ads
in there a month.

445
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:27,851
They get 30-50
responses each.

446
00:29:27,935 --> 00:29:29,311
That's 4,000-5,000 women.

447
00:29:29,394 --> 00:29:33,357
Do we go out with 5,000 women?
Hell, no.

448
00:29:33,398 --> 00:29:36,860
She's into rhyming ads,
so we put one in...

449
00:29:36,944 --> 00:29:38,862
moon, June, spoon,
sand dune.

450
00:29:38,946 --> 00:29:41,698
We set up dates
with 40-50 of them.

451
00:29:42,449 --> 00:29:44,535
We take them out...

452
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:46,370
some restaurant,
some bar...

453
00:29:46,453 --> 00:29:48,914
get prints on a wineglass...

454
00:29:48,997 --> 00:29:50,624
Bingo! She's dropped.

455
00:29:51,667 --> 00:29:54,503
That's horseshit,
but I love it.

456
00:29:54,545 --> 00:29:58,006
How many guys placed ads
last month that rhymed?

457
00:29:58,048 --> 00:29:59,466
Three.

458
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:02,803
She went out
with two of them.

459
00:30:02,886 --> 00:30:04,555
Oh, shit!

460
00:30:04,638 --> 00:30:06,682
We haven't chased down
that third guy.

461
00:30:06,765 --> 00:30:10,185
Raymond Brown.
8130 Austin Avenue.

462
00:30:10,227 --> 00:30:11,812
I tracked him
through his postbox.

463
00:30:11,895 --> 00:30:13,355
You a fucking cop?

464
00:30:13,438 --> 00:30:14,481
Sometimes.

465
00:30:21,446 --> 00:30:23,407
Gruber.

466
00:30:23,448 --> 00:30:25,534
I'll catch up with you.

467
00:30:27,619 --> 00:30:29,037
How you doing?

468
00:30:29,079 --> 00:30:33,834
This 20-year thing,
it's kicking my ass.

469
00:30:36,879 --> 00:30:38,380
I'm sorry.

470
00:30:45,429 --> 00:30:48,807
"Raymond Brown,
Downtown Brown."

471
00:30:48,891 --> 00:30:50,309
Here we go.

472
00:30:50,392 --> 00:30:51,852
"Loneliness and silence...

473
00:30:51,935 --> 00:30:54,354

"All the love I have inside...

475
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:59,318
- is ripping me asunder."
- Ha ha!

476
00:30:59,401 --> 00:31:01,486
"The city is a jungle of pain...

477

478
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:06,700
So be so kind
as to answer this ad...

479
00:31:06,783 --> 00:31:09,244
and you can ride on my pole.

480
00:31:09,328 --> 00:31:11,288
Give the guy a break.

481
00:31:11,371 --> 00:31:13,749
This is a major
lonleyhearts here.

482
00:31:13,832 --> 00:31:14,917
Major.

483
00:31:18,795 --> 00:31:21,173
Good afternoon.
I'm Detective Frank Keller.

484

00:31:27,304 --> 00:31:28,931
They're cops.

488
00:31:28,972 --> 00:31:30,390
What's up, fellas?

489
00:31:30,474 --> 00:31:31,892
What's the matter?

490
00:31:31,975 --> 00:31:33,602
Daddy, are you okay?

491
00:31:34,311 --> 00:31:37,147
I want to tell
you something.

492

I love my family.

Raymond, no kidding,
we don't give a shit.

494
00:31:41,652 --> 00:31:43,946
We need names
of your dates...

495
00:31:43,987 --> 00:31:45,280
and their letters.

496
00:31:45,322 --> 00:31:46,448
No letters.

497
00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:49,993
Raymond, there's some
psycho woman killing guys.

498
00:31:50,077 --> 00:31:52,955
I swear I didn't
go out with them.

499
00:31:52,996 --> 00:31:55,332
I threw the letters away.

500
00:31:55,415 --> 00:31:58,627
Raymond, you take the time...

501
00:31:58,669 --> 00:32:01,839
to make up
this beautiful poem...

502
00:32:01,922 --> 00:32:03,924
about loneliness
and silence.

503
00:32:04,007 --> 00:32:05,425
You spring $300...

504
00:32:05,509 --> 00:32:08,470
to put the ad
in the magazine.

505
00:32:08,554 --> 00:32:11,515
You spring another,
say, 5 yards a month...

506
00:32:11,557 --> 00:32:14,518
for some love nest
in the village...

507
00:32:14,601 --> 00:32:17,521
50 bucks for
the post office box.

508
00:32:17,563 --> 00:32:18,981
You're telling us...

509
00:32:19,064 --> 00:32:21,525
you never
went out with them?

510
00:32:21,608 --> 00:32:23,986
Raymond, please.

511
00:32:24,069 --> 00:32:27,030
The worst part
of being a cop...

512
00:32:27,072 --> 00:32:30,033
is all you hear
from people are lies.

513
00:32:30,075 --> 00:32:33,036
"I didn't do it.
I wasn't there.

514
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,496
It's somebody else."

515
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:37,040
Blah this. Blah that.

516
00:32:37,124 --> 00:32:41,044
I swear on the eyes
of my children.

517
00:32:43,422 --> 00:32:46,383
30 sit-downs,
30 sets of prints...

518
00:32:46,425 --> 00:32:48,385
Miss Wrong, we got her.

519
00:32:48,427 --> 00:32:51,388
Upstairs gives us 300
for the magazine ad...

520
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:55,350
we spring for a few <i>vinos,</i>
a chef salad or two...

521
00:32:55,392 --> 00:32:57,186
bag the wine glasses,
it's over.

522
00:32:57,227 --> 00:32:59,104
What? Come on.

523
00:33:00,147 --> 00:33:01,899
"What? Come on"?

524
00:33:01,982 --> 00:33:07,321
Suppose I get my own money,
buy the ad myself...

525
00:33:07,404 --> 00:33:10,866
we drop her, you pay me back
like it's a bet?

526
00:33:10,949 --> 00:33:15,204
Suppose I set you up
with my sister-in-law?

527
00:33:15,287 --> 00:33:16,747
She got great tits.

528
00:33:16,788 --> 00:33:19,082
Divorced, no kids, no cats.

529
00:33:24,588 --> 00:33:27,799
The lieu's sister-in-law...
she sounds great.

530
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:36,725
I swear on the eyes
of my children.

531
00:33:40,103 --> 00:33:41,897
We should've tailed him.

532
00:33:45,317 --> 00:33:46,902
We fucked up.

533
00:33:48,487 --> 00:33:50,364
He fucked up.

534
00:33:53,116 --> 00:33:54,868
Don't leave the restaurant.

535
00:33:54,910 --> 00:33:56,370
Don't lay a hand on them.

536
00:33:56,453 --> 00:33:58,455
Don't have
intercourse with them.

537
00:33:58,497 --> 00:33:59,915
It's over.
I'm not doing it.

538
00:33:59,957 --> 00:34:02,918
You converse, you get prints,
and you split.

539
00:34:03,001 --> 00:34:06,129
You wear a wire.
We'll have a sound van outside.

540
00:34:06,213 --> 00:34:08,882
Two-man backup
at another table.

541
00:34:08,966 --> 00:34:11,301
Keep the restaurant receipts.

542
00:34:11,385 --> 00:34:15,055
I don't want to read about this
in <i>The Village Voice.</i>

543
00:34:15,138 --> 00:34:17,599
What's with the backup
and wire?

544
00:34:17,641 --> 00:34:21,103
What's she going to do... confess,
shoot me? We're in a restaurant.

545
00:34:21,186 --> 00:34:23,564
To make me happy.

546
00:34:23,647 --> 00:34:26,233
Now, who's writing the ad?
Who's the poet?

547
00:34:28,819 --> 00:34:30,279
Roses are red...

548
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,155
violets are blue...

549
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:33,740
I got one yea-long...

550
00:34:33,824 --> 00:34:35,784
and it's all for you.

551
00:34:35,826 --> 00:34:37,786
I got one yea-long!

552
00:34:37,828 --> 00:34:39,496
Check it out.

553
00:34:41,039 --> 00:34:44,001
I got one, I got one,
I got one!

554
00:34:44,042 --> 00:34:45,627
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

555
00:34:45,711 --> 00:34:47,212
Check this one out.

556
00:34:47,296 --> 00:34:50,382
Windswept hallways
in my heart...

557
00:34:51,383 --> 00:34:54,178
echo the blackness
of eternity.

558
00:34:54,261 --> 00:34:55,429
Get out!

559
00:34:55,512 --> 00:34:56,805
Edgar Allan Poe, this guy.

560
00:34:56,889 --> 00:35:00,475
I'll be sitting across
from Morticia Addams.

561
00:35:00,517 --> 00:35:02,769
- Thing.
- Gomez!

562
00:35:03,687 --> 00:35:05,606
No, she's a shooter, right?

563
00:35:05,689 --> 00:35:08,233
So, how about
something like, um...

564
00:35:09,276 --> 00:35:12,154
Uh... many a girl
has shot me down.

565
00:35:12,237 --> 00:35:13,697
I've been shot before...

566
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:15,199
Shot me down...

567
00:35:15,282 --> 00:35:18,785
Hot to trot,
give Frank a shot.

568
00:35:18,869 --> 00:35:21,830
I live alone...

569
00:35:21,872 --> 00:35:23,373
within myself...

570
00:35:23,457 --> 00:35:27,044
like a hut
within the woods.

571
00:35:27,127 --> 00:35:31,423
I keep my heart high
upon a shelf...

572
00:35:31,507 --> 00:35:34,384
barren of other goods.

573
00:35:34,468 --> 00:35:37,888
I need another's arms
to reach for it...

574
00:35:37,971 --> 00:35:40,891
and place it
where it belongs.

575
00:35:40,974 --> 00:35:44,895
I need another's touch
and smile...

576
00:35:44,978 --> 00:35:48,398
to fill my hut with songs.

577
00:35:51,985 --> 00:35:53,445
Not bad, huh?

578
00:35:53,529 --> 00:35:55,822
It's a little corny,
but it's good.

579
00:35:55,906 --> 00:35:57,199
Better than what we got.

580
00:35:57,241 --> 00:36:00,244
Just make that up, Mr. K?

581
00:36:00,327 --> 00:36:02,037
Frank's mother wrote that.

582
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:05,207
In high school. 1934.

583
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:10,671
She was a goddamn
beautiful person.

584
00:36:12,506 --> 00:36:14,216
Go ahead. Use it.

585
00:36:14,258 --> 00:36:15,926
She'd have liked that.

586
00:36:16,009 --> 00:36:18,387
- Good poem.
- Say it again.

587
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:20,430
You guys are fucking slobs.

588
00:36:20,472 --> 00:36:22,933
- And you're <i>GQ.</i>
- Later, Frank.

589
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:36,613
Oh, God.

590
00:36:45,706 --> 00:36:47,958
Pop. Come on.

591
00:36:48,041 --> 00:36:50,460
You stay here
with me tonight.

592
00:36:50,544 --> 00:36:52,004
Come on, come on.

593
00:36:52,087 --> 00:36:54,965
Come on. Come.
Come on.

594
00:36:55,048 --> 00:36:57,509
Come on, come on. Come on.

595
00:36:57,593 --> 00:36:58,969
That's it, that's it.

596
00:36:59,052 --> 00:37:01,513
Where are you taking me?

597
00:37:09,062 --> 00:37:13,525
Am I walking?
I'm walking, right?

598
00:37:13,609 --> 00:37:16,153
Pass for it, yeah.

599
00:37:23,493 --> 00:37:25,329
You got the wrong guy.

600
00:37:25,412 --> 00:37:27,289
- Shut up.
- I'm the wrong guy.

601
00:37:27,331 --> 00:37:28,665
Sorry, Frank.

602
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:39,593
Okay, kid, smell
a shooter in there?

603
00:37:39,676 --> 00:37:41,303
Ahh.

604
00:37:51,104 --> 00:37:52,397
I don't know, Gloria.

605
00:37:52,481 --> 00:37:55,400
I just got this...
this hopeful feeling...

606
00:37:55,484 --> 00:37:57,402
when I read your letter.

607
00:37:57,486 --> 00:38:00,030
It was just...
I can't explain it.

608
00:38:01,031 --> 00:38:03,408
I'm a printer. Yeah.

609
00:38:03,492 --> 00:38:04,868
My own business.

610
00:38:04,952 --> 00:38:07,871
Amanda. My mother's name
was Amanda.

611
00:38:07,955 --> 00:38:10,666
- Okay.
- Miranda.

612
00:38:10,749 --> 00:38:13,043
You're a what?
That's what?

613
00:38:13,126 --> 00:38:16,630
You like guys and girls
or girls?

614
00:38:17,548 --> 00:38:21,343
Oh, that's cool.
That's cool. Me?

615
00:38:21,385 --> 00:38:23,387
Yeah, well, sometimes,
you know...

616
00:38:23,428 --> 00:38:26,014
but, uh, mainly girls.

617
00:38:27,558 --> 00:38:29,268
Women, you know.

618
00:38:30,561 --> 00:38:32,187
Uh-huh. Well...

619
00:38:32,271 --> 00:38:34,022
how's around, uh...

620
00:38:34,898 --> 00:38:36,358
you a night owl?

621
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,152
Solid. Let's get crazy then.

622
00:38:47,494 --> 00:38:50,455
Not that I haven't
done this before.

623
00:38:54,418 --> 00:38:55,752
Shove this in here.

624
00:38:55,836 --> 00:38:57,212
I like doing this.

625
00:38:57,296 --> 00:38:59,840
- Is he on, Bill?
- Yup.

626
00:38:59,923 --> 00:39:01,216
Okay, man.

627
00:39:01,258 --> 00:39:03,886
- I look natural.
- You look good.

628
00:39:22,446 --> 00:39:24,072
Can I help you?

629
00:39:26,992 --> 00:39:29,411
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening.

630
00:39:29,453 --> 00:39:30,913
Chair this evening?

631
00:39:30,954 --> 00:39:32,414
Yes, thank you.

632
00:39:32,456 --> 00:39:34,917
- Cocktail this evening?
- Yeah.

633
00:39:34,958 --> 00:39:36,460
What kind, sir?

634
00:39:36,543 --> 00:39:38,128
Bourbon and water.

635
00:39:38,212 --> 00:39:40,589
Bourbon and water
it is, sir.

636
00:39:40,631 --> 00:39:42,216
Come back, now.

637
00:39:44,968 --> 00:39:47,012
Do you remember

638
00:39:48,639 --> 00:39:50,265
<i>When we met </i>

639
00:39:50,349 --> 00:39:52,935
<i>That's the day </i>

640
00:39:53,018 --> 00:39:54,561
I knew you were my pet

641
00:39:54,645 --> 00:39:58,607
Can I get a little
hi-de-hi here?

642
00:40:02,194 --> 00:40:06,448
If I look half as good as you
at your age...

643
00:40:06,490 --> 00:40:08,867
you got nothing
to worry about.

644
00:40:08,951 --> 00:40:10,410
You look great.

645
00:40:10,494 --> 00:40:11,912
You're very sweet.

646
00:40:11,995 --> 00:40:15,582
It's just that I should've said
on the phone the age I am.

647
00:40:15,666 --> 00:40:20,462
You look better than
3/4 of the girls I know...

648
00:40:20,504 --> 00:40:22,506
that are half your age.

649
00:40:22,548 --> 00:40:24,967
Did that come out right?

650
00:40:26,051 --> 00:40:28,595
Yes, yes, thank you.
I'll buy that.

651
00:40:28,679 --> 00:40:31,306
I'll quit while I'm ahead.

652
00:40:37,437 --> 00:40:40,816
So, uh, the lady would like
another white wine?

653
00:40:40,899 --> 00:40:43,485
- Yes, please.
- And I'm fine here.

654
00:41:10,053 --> 00:41:11,513
Well...

655
00:41:11,597 --> 00:41:13,724
what do we do now?

656
00:41:13,807 --> 00:41:15,225
Well, I tell you...

657
00:41:15,309 --> 00:41:19,771
I got to pick up
my son in half an hour...

658
00:41:19,855 --> 00:41:21,690
and the timing's terrible.

659
00:41:21,773 --> 00:41:23,817
Should we
have dinner sometime?

660
00:41:23,901 --> 00:41:25,527
Oh, sure. We'll call.

661
00:41:26,570 --> 00:41:27,821
We?

662
00:41:29,615 --> 00:41:32,201
- We? I said we?
- Yes.

663
00:41:32,242 --> 00:41:37,039
That's me. All day on the phone,
it's "We this, we that,"

664
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:38,999
meaning my company,
you know. I'll call you.

665
00:41:39,082 --> 00:41:41,376
Check, please.

666
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:43,003
I'll call you.

667
00:41:43,086 --> 00:41:44,713
Me.

668
00:41:46,131 --> 00:41:47,674
No, you won't.

669
00:42:00,103 --> 00:42:01,396
Oh, well.

670
00:42:03,607 --> 00:42:05,067
I don't know.

671
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:07,569
I get this
very weird feeling...

672
00:42:07,653 --> 00:42:10,572
you're not
who you say are you.

673
00:42:10,614 --> 00:42:12,407
There's something
not right about this.

674
00:42:12,449 --> 00:42:14,076
Oh?

675
00:42:14,117 --> 00:42:16,119
What do you mean?
Like what?

676
00:42:16,203 --> 00:42:18,080
You got cop's eyes.

677
00:42:18,121 --> 00:42:19,915
Cop's eyes.

678
00:42:19,957 --> 00:42:22,084
You look at me, I feel like
I did something.

679
00:42:22,167 --> 00:42:24,419
Like what?

680
00:42:24,503 --> 00:42:27,422
My ex-husband was a cop.

681
00:42:27,506 --> 00:42:29,007
You're a printer?

682
00:42:29,091 --> 00:42:32,553
If you're a printer,
I got a dick.

683
00:42:32,636 --> 00:42:34,805
Well.

684
00:42:34,888 --> 00:42:37,599
I didn't doubt it
for a minute, baby.

685
00:42:41,478 --> 00:42:45,566
Think you could go
for a babe with a dick?

686
00:42:45,649 --> 00:42:47,609
Depends on
her personality, really.

687
00:42:50,362 --> 00:42:52,739
So, you're divorced, right?

688
00:42:52,823 --> 00:42:54,283
I said that.

689
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,702
You got kids?

690
00:42:56,785 --> 00:42:58,203
Kid... one kid.

691
00:42:58,287 --> 00:42:59,288
A boy?

692
00:42:59,371 --> 00:43:00,789
No. A girl.

693
00:43:00,831 --> 00:43:03,166
You got a girl, right?

694
00:43:06,503 --> 00:43:07,921
You know, it's interesting...

695
00:43:08,005 --> 00:43:09,923
your coming
from York, Pennsylvania...

696
00:43:10,007 --> 00:43:11,967
because in a way...

697
00:43:12,009 --> 00:43:15,762
you went from York
to New York.

698
00:43:15,846 --> 00:43:18,765
You like the park,
and I like the beach.

699
00:43:18,849 --> 00:43:22,144
You're a printer,
I manage a shoe store.

700
00:43:22,227 --> 00:43:25,606
And I don't believe in
wasting time on this stuff.

701
00:43:25,689 --> 00:43:28,609
You know what you know
and you go with it.

702
00:43:30,027 --> 00:43:33,280
- You go with what?
- You're just not my type.

703
00:43:36,033 --> 00:43:39,453
Oh, well.
I mean, you just sat down.

704
00:43:39,536 --> 00:43:42,206
Give it a little bit of time.

705
00:43:42,289 --> 00:43:44,166
I believe
in animal attraction.

706
00:43:44,208 --> 00:43:48,462
I believe in love at first sight.
I believe in this.

707
00:43:48,545 --> 00:43:50,839
I don't feel it with you.

708
00:43:53,050 --> 00:43:56,011
I'm hell on wheels
once you know me.

709
00:43:56,094 --> 00:43:58,514
How are you folks doing here?
Is that wine okay, miss?

710
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:06,021
You haven't even
touched your glass.

711
00:44:06,063 --> 00:44:07,648
Have a little sip.

712
00:44:07,731 --> 00:44:10,025
You know, warm up.

713
00:44:10,067 --> 00:44:12,069
Let's raise a glass here.

714
00:44:12,152 --> 00:44:13,612
Come on, here.

715
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:16,657
- Let's have a happy hunting toast.
- It's nothing personal.

716
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:19,493
Oh, come on.
Where are you going?

717
00:44:19,576 --> 00:44:22,829
Come on.
Kiss my tiara, bitch.

718
00:44:22,913 --> 00:44:24,248
Look at that.

719
00:44:24,331 --> 00:44:25,832
I didn't get prints.

720
00:44:25,916 --> 00:44:28,252
I didn't get prints.

721
00:44:29,586 --> 00:44:32,381
How many more
of these we got?

722
00:44:37,594 --> 00:44:39,847
Okay. That's two more.

723
00:44:41,098 --> 00:44:43,100
Two more.

724
00:44:45,769 --> 00:44:48,188
Ah, no.

725
00:45:00,325 --> 00:45:02,703
Oh, mercy, mercy, mercy.

726
00:45:04,454 --> 00:45:05,622
How are you doing, Frank?

727
00:45:05,706 --> 00:45:06,915
Okay.

728
00:45:12,462 --> 00:45:14,089
Anything on the prints?

729
00:45:14,131 --> 00:45:16,383
Nothing yet.
How's your head?

730
00:45:16,466 --> 00:45:17,926
It couldn't be worse.

731
00:45:17,968 --> 00:45:19,887
Hey, how are you doing?

732
00:45:19,970 --> 00:45:21,388
Terry. Cabletone.

733
00:45:21,471 --> 00:45:23,390
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
What's up?

734
00:45:23,473 --> 00:45:24,892
I told your partner...

735
00:45:24,975 --> 00:45:27,811
there was a kid there
that day.

736
00:45:27,895 --> 00:45:29,605
A black kid.

737
00:45:29,646 --> 00:45:31,815
I think he was
from the supermarket...

738
00:45:31,899 --> 00:45:35,402
'cause I saw him
with groceries earlier on.

739
00:45:35,485 --> 00:45:38,405
Anyhow, I'm working
down in the basement.

740
00:45:38,488 --> 00:45:39,907
About 20 minutes later...

741
00:45:39,990 --> 00:45:42,868
he tears through there
like a bat out of hell.

742
00:45:42,951 --> 00:45:44,119
No groceries.

743
00:45:44,203 --> 00:45:48,957
I mean, why is he going out
through the basement?

744
00:45:49,041 --> 00:45:51,084
There's a lobby, right?

745
00:45:52,836 --> 00:45:54,463
Anyhow...

746
00:45:54,505 --> 00:45:56,298
the kid has those, um...

747
00:45:56,340 --> 00:45:58,800
those black militant
corn holes...

748
00:45:58,884 --> 00:46:02,346
I mean, corn rows
in his hair.

749
00:46:03,889 --> 00:46:07,809
He looks like a real shitbag,
if you ask me.

750
00:46:13,690 --> 00:46:17,528
How are you doing, Chief?
One of your kids got corn rows?

751
00:46:17,611 --> 00:46:19,279
You know, Afro hairdo?

752
00:46:20,614 --> 00:46:22,115
Stevie Wonder hair.

753
00:46:22,199 --> 00:46:25,619
- Wonder hair?
- Reggie, he means Quawi.

754
00:46:25,702 --> 00:46:26,995
Where's he?

755
00:46:27,037 --> 00:46:29,998
- I fired his ass Monday.
- How come?

756
00:46:30,082 --> 00:46:32,960
On a delivery,
he doesn't like the tip...

757
00:46:33,043 --> 00:46:35,170
he screams at the customer.

758
00:46:35,254 --> 00:46:37,840
- You got his address?
- Maybe.

759
00:46:37,923 --> 00:46:40,384
What did he do,
kill somebody?

760
00:46:42,094 --> 00:46:44,805
Quawi...
Quawi Benjamin.

761
00:46:44,888 --> 00:46:47,683
"Spooney." Call him that,
he goes crazy.

762
00:46:48,559 --> 00:46:50,519
I got nothing here.

763
00:46:50,561 --> 00:46:53,188
He only worked
like a week or so.

764
00:46:53,272 --> 00:46:57,317
If he comes in
or you see him, call us.

765
00:46:57,401 --> 00:46:58,527
Sure.

766
00:47:14,001 --> 00:47:16,003
Hell on wheels, huh?

767
00:47:17,254 --> 00:47:19,214
How quickly we forget.

768
00:47:21,967 --> 00:47:23,927
No.
I don't forget you.

769
00:47:24,011 --> 00:47:26,388
You're the "animal attraction,"
right?

770
00:47:26,471 --> 00:47:28,891
"Love at first sight."

771
00:47:28,932 --> 00:47:32,311
- What, do you live around here?
- Mm-hmm.

772
00:47:32,394 --> 00:47:33,437
Oh, yeah?

773
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:35,480
88th Street.

774
00:47:35,564 --> 00:47:38,066
Oh, yeah?
I live on 85th.

775
00:47:38,150 --> 00:47:41,445
You know that poem you wrote,
you didn't write it.

776
00:47:41,528 --> 00:47:43,530
I read that poem...

777
00:47:43,614 --> 00:47:47,034
and figured this is either
a very sensitive guy...

778
00:47:47,117 --> 00:47:49,828
or he ripped off
some lady's poem...

779
00:47:49,912 --> 00:47:51,413
or some girl's poem.

780
00:47:51,496 --> 00:47:54,374
- You didn't write it, right?
- Nope.

781
00:47:54,458 --> 00:47:56,251
Some lady did, right?

782
00:47:56,293 --> 00:47:59,379
My mother wrote it
some 50-odd years ago.

783
00:47:59,463 --> 00:48:01,840
That's why my father fell
in love with her.

784
00:48:01,924 --> 00:48:03,550
Something like that.

785
00:48:04,676 --> 00:48:06,220
Is that true?

786
00:48:06,303 --> 00:48:08,222
So he says.

787
00:48:10,891 --> 00:48:13,310
Hmm. I like that.

788
00:48:13,393 --> 00:48:16,980
I like that, uh,
that you did that.

789
00:48:17,064 --> 00:48:20,359
You want to hear
my idea of poetry?

790
00:48:20,442 --> 00:48:22,319
Precision in life.

791
00:48:22,402 --> 00:48:25,280
Knowing when and how
to make your move.

792
00:48:25,364 --> 00:48:27,115
Say your piece...

793
00:48:27,199 --> 00:48:30,285
like you the other night
with me.

794
00:48:32,871 --> 00:48:34,790
Oh, that was...

795
00:48:34,873 --> 00:48:36,333
poetry in motion.

796
00:48:36,416 --> 00:48:37,918
Beautiful.

797
00:48:38,001 --> 00:48:39,127
Beautiful.

798
00:48:40,379 --> 00:48:41,964
Look at me.

799
00:48:43,882 --> 00:48:45,300
What?

800
00:48:45,384 --> 00:48:49,638
You still want to go have
that happy hunting toast?

801
00:48:51,890 --> 00:48:54,935
What happened to, uh,
the animal attraction?

802
00:48:56,854 --> 00:48:58,647
What are you,
fucking nuts?

803
00:48:58,730 --> 00:49:00,649
What if she's the doer?

804
00:49:00,732 --> 00:49:02,651
We won't get the prints
back till tomorrow.

805
00:49:02,734 --> 00:49:04,486
Wait till then.

806
00:49:04,528 --> 00:49:07,322
Hey, come on,
the doer's down south.

807
00:49:07,406 --> 00:49:10,325
Spooney, Quawi,
what's his name.

808
00:49:10,409 --> 00:49:11,827
Listen, listen.

809
00:49:11,910 --> 00:49:14,454
This... This one walked.

810
00:49:14,538 --> 00:49:15,330
You remember her?

811
00:49:15,372 --> 00:49:17,165
You with that bitch...

812
00:49:17,207 --> 00:49:18,458
who wouldn't even
drink with you?

813
00:49:18,542 --> 00:49:22,337
Yeah. It's good in a way.
I'll get her prints.

814
00:49:22,379 --> 00:49:26,216
By sending your dick
to the lab?

815
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:28,177
That'll be
some great testimony...

816
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:30,179
"You see, Your Honor...

817
00:49:30,220 --> 00:49:32,681
"first, I whipped it out,
then she whipped it out."

818
00:49:32,764 --> 00:49:34,308
You catch my drift?

819
00:49:34,391 --> 00:49:36,310
How do you know
it's this Quawi kid?

820
00:49:36,393 --> 00:49:39,938
It's probably a broad.
You know that.

821
00:49:40,022 --> 00:49:42,858
She's a friggin' suspect.
Walk away.

822
00:49:43,942 --> 00:49:46,820
Frankie? Just walk away.

823
00:49:46,904 --> 00:49:48,197
Nothing to it, Chief.

824
00:49:48,238 --> 00:49:50,157
That's it.
I'm walking. Okay?

825
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:51,825
See you tomorrow.

826
00:49:54,411 --> 00:49:56,371
No. Just a girlfriend.

827
00:49:56,413 --> 00:49:59,374
Yeah. All right.

828
00:49:59,416 --> 00:50:03,545
Okay. Thanks a lot.
I'll talk to you later.

829
00:50:05,923 --> 00:50:07,883
Something came up,
you know.

830
00:50:07,925 --> 00:50:09,384
Isn't that crazy?

831
00:50:09,468 --> 00:50:10,886
Boy.

832
00:50:13,805 --> 00:50:15,432
What's your name again?

833
00:50:16,308 --> 00:50:17,559
Helen.

834
00:50:21,146 --> 00:50:22,898
Helen.

835
00:50:22,981 --> 00:50:24,650
You know why
I got married?

836
00:50:24,691 --> 00:50:26,860
I was 37.
I wasn't married.

837
00:50:26,902 --> 00:50:30,531
- So I got married.
- I can top that.

838
00:50:30,572 --> 00:50:32,282
You know why
I got married?

839
00:50:32,366 --> 00:50:35,202
Some guy says, "I love you".
I knew him a week.

840
00:50:35,285 --> 00:50:38,789
- Playing hard to get?
- Yeah, right.

841
00:50:38,872 --> 00:50:41,250
We didn't last very long.

842
00:50:41,333 --> 00:50:42,417
Me, neither.

843
00:50:42,501 --> 00:50:45,420
The wedding lasted longer
than the marriage.

844
00:50:45,462 --> 00:50:46,922
But we still...

845
00:50:47,005 --> 00:50:49,424
We're still friends.

846
00:50:49,508 --> 00:50:52,970
Sort of. You?

847
00:50:53,053 --> 00:50:54,847
Friends? No.

848
00:50:54,930 --> 00:50:57,766
I found out I was pregnant,
I walked.

849
00:50:57,808 --> 00:50:59,393
You walked?

850
00:50:59,476 --> 00:51:00,936
What do you mean?

851
00:51:00,978 --> 00:51:04,982
- The guy didn't know about the kid?
- No. He's out of the picture.

852
00:51:06,483 --> 00:51:08,944
You know, sometimes when
I think about...

853
00:51:09,027 --> 00:51:12,239
the people I got involved with,
the choices I made...

854
00:51:12,322 --> 00:51:14,449
it's pretty amazing.

855
00:51:14,491 --> 00:51:16,451
But I found something out.

856
00:51:16,493 --> 00:51:19,913
There are very few mistakes
that can't be corrected...

857
00:51:19,997 --> 00:51:21,957
if you got the guts.

858
00:51:21,999 --> 00:51:24,001
If you got the guts.

859
00:51:24,042 --> 00:51:26,003
Last call.

860
00:51:27,796 --> 00:51:29,673
What are they, bombing us?

861
00:51:32,509 --> 00:51:34,386
Oh, hell.

862
00:51:37,514 --> 00:51:40,475
You know,
when it gets late...

863
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:42,186
sometimes...

864
00:51:44,521 --> 00:51:47,482
I feel like a... big cat...

865
00:51:47,566 --> 00:51:49,443
in a small cage.

866
00:51:49,526 --> 00:51:51,987
Oh, yeah?

867
00:51:52,029 --> 00:51:54,156
You know...

868
00:51:55,157 --> 00:51:57,993
I have done some desperate,
foolish things...

869
00:51:58,076 --> 00:52:00,120
come 3:00 in the morning.

870
00:52:00,204 --> 00:52:03,332
You mean
like being here with me?

871
00:53:06,603 --> 00:53:08,063
Where's your bathroom?

872
00:53:08,146 --> 00:53:09,481
Huh?

873
00:53:11,108 --> 00:53:12,442
Where's your bathroom?

874
00:53:12,526 --> 00:53:14,069
Over there.

875
00:53:14,987 --> 00:53:16,363
Where's my bag?

876
00:53:24,121 --> 00:53:25,873
Get in bed.

877
00:53:25,956 --> 00:53:27,916
Jesus Christ.

878
00:53:27,958 --> 00:53:29,543
Oh, good Christ.

879
00:53:30,460 --> 00:53:31,920
Holy fuck.

880
00:53:32,963 --> 00:53:34,548
What the fuck?

881
00:53:38,969 --> 00:53:40,929
Oh, shit.

882
00:53:40,971 --> 00:53:42,890
Holy fuck.

883
00:53:42,973 --> 00:53:44,433
Oh, my God.

884
00:53:45,350 --> 00:53:48,270
Holy fuck.
Oh, I can't believe it.

885
00:53:48,312 --> 00:53:49,730
I can't believe it.

886
00:53:49,813 --> 00:53:50,814
Oh, fuck.

887
00:53:50,898 --> 00:53:52,399
Jesus Christ.

888
00:54:02,826 --> 00:54:04,286
Oh! Oh, my God!

889
00:54:04,369 --> 00:54:06,413
Where did you put it?

890
00:54:06,496 --> 00:54:09,374
Oh, no! No! No!

891
00:54:09,458 --> 00:54:10,918
What are you doing?

892
00:54:11,001 --> 00:54:12,377
Open the door!

893
00:54:12,461 --> 00:54:14,755
Open this fucking door!
Open this door!

894
00:54:14,838 --> 00:54:16,465
What is it?

895
00:54:16,548 --> 00:54:18,800
This ain't real.

896
00:54:18,842 --> 00:54:20,969
Open this fucking door!

897
00:54:23,764 --> 00:54:26,266
It's a starter's pistol.
I saw...

898
00:54:26,350 --> 00:54:28,894
You goddamn son of a bitch!

899
00:54:28,977 --> 00:54:30,062
Easy, easy.

900
00:54:30,145 --> 00:54:32,523
Don't you ever fucking
put your hands on me!

901
00:54:32,606 --> 00:54:35,108
- I got scared.
- Tell me about scared.

902
00:54:35,192 --> 00:54:37,486
What are you doing
with a starter's pistol?

903
00:54:37,569 --> 00:54:39,488
None of your business!
Get off of me.

904
00:54:39,571 --> 00:54:42,533
Listen. Listen to me!

905
00:54:44,368 --> 00:54:46,995
I saw the gun
sticking out of the purse.

906
00:54:47,079 --> 00:54:49,623
I freaked, okay?
It was a reflex.

907
00:54:49,706 --> 00:54:52,960
Feel my heart.
Go ahead.

908
00:54:53,043 --> 00:54:55,128
It's like a drum.

909
00:54:55,170 --> 00:54:56,547
Feel it?

910
00:55:06,056 --> 00:55:09,142
I'll tell you some stories
about scared sometime.

911
00:55:12,062 --> 00:55:13,647
You don't know.

912
00:55:17,067 --> 00:55:18,527
This city...

913
00:55:18,569 --> 00:55:20,654
what it does to people.

914
00:55:28,579 --> 00:55:31,039
I can't apologize enough for...

915
00:55:31,081 --> 00:55:33,041
I don't know.

916
00:55:33,125 --> 00:55:36,044
I got this survival rush.
You start to...

917
00:55:36,128 --> 00:55:39,047
You start to think
with your hands...

918
00:55:39,089 --> 00:55:40,507
not your...

919
00:55:40,591 --> 00:55:41,717
Like an animal.

920
00:55:41,758 --> 00:55:43,135
I just...

921
00:55:43,218 --> 00:55:45,012
Did I hurt you?

922
00:55:45,095 --> 00:55:46,722
No.

923
00:56:08,118 --> 00:56:09,328
What?

924
00:56:13,457 --> 00:56:14,917
What?

925
00:56:25,135 --> 00:56:26,887
What are you looking for?

926
00:56:26,970 --> 00:56:28,096
What are you doing?

927
00:56:28,138 --> 00:56:29,932
What are you looking for?

928
00:56:30,015 --> 00:56:31,433
Huh? Huh?

929
00:56:35,145 --> 00:56:37,397
What are you looking for, huh?

930
00:56:39,316 --> 00:56:41,318
What are you looking for?

931
00:56:41,401 --> 00:56:42,569
Oh.

932
00:56:43,654 --> 00:56:44,738
Huh?

933
00:56:49,159 --> 00:56:51,954
Ah, Jesus.

934
00:56:53,664 --> 00:56:54,831
Oh, yeah.

935
00:56:57,668 --> 00:56:59,461
Oh, Jesus.

936
00:56:59,503 --> 00:57:01,588
What are you looking for?

937
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:08,762
What are you looking for?

938
00:57:35,289 --> 00:57:38,667
It was too late
to call you back.

939
00:57:38,709 --> 00:57:40,210
Yeah, just a friend.

940
00:57:40,294 --> 00:57:42,713
Okay, I'll be home...

941
00:57:42,796 --> 00:57:45,841
I'll be home
when I get home. Bye.

942
00:57:47,259 --> 00:57:48,844
Damn.

943
00:58:17,998 --> 00:58:19,750
You're killing me.

944
00:58:47,861 --> 00:58:49,279
Is that the sun?

945
00:58:52,783 --> 00:58:54,576
Are we still alive?

946
00:58:54,618 --> 00:58:56,954
I thought you were
an insomniac.

947
00:58:57,037 --> 00:58:58,747
I am.

948
00:58:58,789 --> 00:59:01,416
I must have fainted.

949
00:59:04,336 --> 00:59:06,713
What are you doing there?

950
00:59:06,797 --> 00:59:08,715
I can't make you out.

951
00:59:08,799 --> 00:59:10,050
Helen, right?

952
00:59:10,133 --> 00:59:12,427
Uh-huh.

953
00:59:12,469 --> 00:59:14,054
Come here.

954
00:59:16,306 --> 00:59:17,558
What?

955
00:59:17,599 --> 00:59:20,727
I got to talk to you.

956
00:59:20,811 --> 00:59:23,272
There's something
I got to say.

957
00:59:23,313 --> 00:59:26,275
You're kidding.

958
00:59:26,316 --> 00:59:27,442
Are you kidding?

959
00:59:27,526 --> 00:59:31,238
I'll have to be airlifted
to a standing position.

960
00:59:31,321 --> 00:59:32,739
But you, you're something.

961
00:59:32,823 --> 00:59:34,700
You go in the kitchen.

962
00:59:34,783 --> 00:59:36,159
You made coffee.

963
00:59:36,243 --> 00:59:38,954
What are you, Superman?

964
00:59:38,996 --> 00:59:40,163
Wonder Woman.

965
00:59:40,247 --> 00:59:42,165
What do you wonder about?

966
00:59:42,249 --> 00:59:46,128
How we made it through
last night in one piece.

967
00:59:47,421 --> 00:59:48,672
Last night?

968
00:59:48,755 --> 00:59:52,176
Let me tell you
about last night.

969
00:59:52,259 --> 00:59:53,343
Let me tell you.

970
00:59:59,474 --> 01:00:00,893
Uh-uh.

971
01:00:00,976 --> 01:00:02,519
No. Yes.

972
01:00:04,062 --> 01:00:05,522
Cut it out.

973
01:00:05,606 --> 01:00:08,066
I have to get home
to my daughter.

974
01:00:08,150 --> 01:00:09,443
Your daughter?

975
01:00:09,484 --> 01:00:11,361
She's with
your mother, right?

976
01:00:11,445 --> 01:00:12,779
Mm-hmm.

977
01:00:12,821 --> 01:00:15,782
Your mother live with you?

978
01:00:15,824 --> 01:00:19,369
She's helping us out
for a couple of weeks.

979
01:00:21,788 --> 01:00:24,374
I don't know about this.

980
01:00:26,835 --> 01:00:30,714
What's it like working
in a print shop?

981
01:00:30,797 --> 01:00:32,216
A print shop?

982
01:00:32,299 --> 01:00:33,675
Yeah.

983
01:00:35,511 --> 01:00:36,845
Inky.

984
01:00:38,055 --> 01:00:41,016
What's it like
running a shoe store?

985
01:00:41,099 --> 01:00:42,309
It's okay.

986
01:00:42,392 --> 01:00:45,687
But we don't live
for our work, do we?

987
01:00:45,771 --> 01:00:47,523
No.

988
01:00:47,606 --> 01:00:50,901
I like to think
I live for love.

989
01:00:50,984 --> 01:00:54,488
I mean, what else is there... food?

990
01:00:59,701 --> 01:01:00,869
You're something else.

991
01:01:00,911 --> 01:01:02,287
No, you're something else.

992
01:01:02,371 --> 01:01:05,791
You've no idea how many creeps
are out there.

993
01:01:05,874 --> 01:01:08,710
You're wired like
no one I ever met...

994
01:01:08,794 --> 01:01:11,338
but you're a good man.

995
01:01:11,421 --> 01:01:12,840
You never know.

996
01:01:12,881 --> 01:01:14,091
I always know.

997
01:01:14,174 --> 01:01:16,635
Or at least I find out.

998
01:01:16,718 --> 01:01:19,555
What do you mean, creeps?

999
01:01:19,638 --> 01:01:22,891
Manipulators. Liars.

1000
01:01:22,933 --> 01:01:25,394
Guys who wait
till you're in deep...

1001
01:01:25,435 --> 01:01:28,355
before you find out
who they really are.

1002
01:01:28,438 --> 01:01:31,316
Then you're fighting
for your life.

1003
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:32,693
Creeps.

1004
01:01:39,283 --> 01:01:41,493
You asked.

1005
01:01:43,245 --> 01:01:45,205
You got any cigarettes?

1006
01:01:45,289 --> 01:01:47,082
You smoke?

1007
01:01:47,165 --> 01:01:49,543
Sometimes.
Does that bother you?

1008
01:01:49,585 --> 01:01:51,044
What brand?

1009
01:01:51,128 --> 01:01:52,379
I mooch.

1010
01:01:52,462 --> 01:01:53,839
I think I'm out.

1011
01:01:53,922 --> 01:01:56,175
Let's see here.

1012
01:01:56,258 --> 01:01:58,719
See any jump out at me?

1013
01:01:58,760 --> 01:02:00,220
I got to go.

1014
01:02:00,304 --> 01:02:02,681
- Huh?
- I got to go.

1015
01:02:02,764 --> 01:02:06,852
I like to be home when
my daughter wakes up.

1016
01:02:21,325 --> 01:02:22,409
Hello.

1017
01:02:22,492 --> 01:02:23,952
Keller here.

1018
01:02:24,036 --> 01:02:25,412
She's still out there.

1019
01:02:25,495 --> 01:02:27,164
No prints match up.

1020
01:02:27,247 --> 01:02:29,541
So, uh...

1021
01:02:29,625 --> 01:02:32,127
So should we dust your dick?

1022
01:02:32,211 --> 01:02:34,630
You know, cover all bases?

1023
01:04:19,484 --> 01:04:21,528
Would you finish that sale?

1024
01:04:50,224 --> 01:04:51,975
Help you
with something, sir?

1025
01:04:53,227 --> 01:04:56,813
Yeah, you got this
in a sneaker?

1026
01:05:00,025 --> 01:05:03,028
I was in the neighborhood,
so, you know...

1027
01:05:03,111 --> 01:05:04,821
I thought I'd come in.

1028
01:05:07,074 --> 01:05:08,617
Why are you whispering?

1029
01:05:08,700 --> 01:05:09,743
I'm whispering?

1030
01:05:09,785 --> 01:05:11,411
- Yeah.
- Sorry.

1031
01:05:11,495 --> 01:05:14,581
I just want to talk to you.

1032
01:05:14,665 --> 01:05:16,208
Okay. Have a seat.

1033
01:05:16,291 --> 01:05:19,336
I'll be with you
in a minute.

1034
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:39,523
What did you want
to talk to me about?

1035
01:05:48,949 --> 01:05:50,367
Well...

1036
01:05:50,450 --> 01:05:53,203
I was going to ask you
about something.

1037
01:05:54,580 --> 01:05:58,125
About some of the people
you've been seeing...

1038
01:05:58,208 --> 01:06:01,170
over the past month or so.

1039
01:06:01,211 --> 01:06:02,671
You know... guys.

1040
01:06:02,754 --> 01:06:05,007
It's none of your business.

1041
01:06:05,090 --> 01:06:07,885
It is, in a way,
my business.

1042
01:06:07,968 --> 01:06:09,636
Yeah, and how's that?

1043
01:06:10,762 --> 01:06:12,181
Well...

1044
01:06:13,056 --> 01:06:14,433
forget it.

1045
01:06:14,516 --> 01:06:16,059
It's stupid.

1046
01:06:16,143 --> 01:06:17,144
Forget it.

1047
01:06:17,227 --> 01:06:22,524
Look, I don't sleep around,
if that's what you're talking about.

1048
01:06:22,608 --> 01:06:24,359
No, that's not it.

1049
01:06:24,401 --> 01:06:27,279
Why don't you
come over to my house...

1050
01:06:27,362 --> 01:06:30,157
tonight for dinner,
and we'll talk.

1051
01:06:30,199 --> 01:06:32,993
Yo. Lady.

1052
01:06:33,035 --> 01:06:36,705
I was in here... what...
six months ago...

1053
01:06:36,788 --> 01:06:38,582
and, uh...

1054
01:06:38,665 --> 01:06:40,876
you had this beautiful boot.

1055
01:06:40,959 --> 01:06:44,505
It was Rivoli, Ravioli...
something like that.

1056
01:06:44,588 --> 01:06:48,550
Rivoli. We're out.
Try back in two weeks.

1057
01:06:53,764 --> 01:06:56,850
Look, can I help you
or what, huh?

1058
01:06:59,144 --> 01:07:00,562
What's your problem?

1059
01:07:00,646 --> 01:07:03,524
Tommy, let's blow.
The guy's a cop.

1060
01:07:06,235 --> 01:07:07,903
Hey, hey...

1061
01:07:07,945 --> 01:07:09,446
Let's blow.

1062
01:07:09,530 --> 01:07:11,406
If I beat the shit out of you...

1063
01:07:11,448 --> 01:07:14,159
I get nailed for assaulting
an officer, right?

1064
01:07:19,790 --> 01:07:21,875
You piece of shit.

1065
01:07:38,267 --> 01:07:39,977
Okay, what?

1066
01:07:40,060 --> 01:07:42,563
You're a cop?

1067
01:07:42,646 --> 01:07:44,690
Yeah.

1068
01:07:44,773 --> 01:07:46,108
So? What?

1069
01:07:48,402 --> 01:07:50,612
Pretty bad, huh?

1070
01:07:50,696 --> 01:07:53,198
It's just too much for you.

1071
01:07:53,282 --> 01:07:55,200
You let that scum in...

1072
01:07:55,284 --> 01:07:57,494
but my being a cop
is just too much.

1073
01:08:00,330 --> 01:08:03,250
Let me tell you something
about this.

1074
01:08:03,292 --> 01:08:07,212
All these people in here
with their rocks and furs...

1075
01:08:07,296 --> 01:08:11,717
they get robbed or raped,
I'm all of a sudden their daddy.

1076
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:13,719
Come the wet-ass hour...

1077
01:08:13,802 --> 01:08:16,638
I'm everybody's daddy!

1078
01:08:24,313 --> 01:08:27,232
Hey, what do you
think you're doing?

1079
01:08:27,316 --> 01:08:28,734
What do you mean?

1080
01:08:28,817 --> 01:08:31,737
Don't try to turn
this around on me.

1081
01:08:31,820 --> 01:08:33,197
You lied to me.

1082
01:08:33,280 --> 01:08:35,157
You looked like the plague.

1083
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:38,493
Why did you say
you were a printer?

1084
01:08:38,535 --> 01:08:40,787
I always wanted
to be a printer.

1085
01:08:40,829 --> 01:08:42,206
Talk to me.

1086
01:08:42,956 --> 01:08:46,668
For 20 years,
I go out with people, right?

1087
01:08:46,710 --> 01:08:50,214
I tell them I'm a cop.
You know what happens?

1088
01:08:50,297 --> 01:08:52,216
I'm a nonperson.

1089
01:08:52,299 --> 01:08:55,052
What do you think
I put the ad in the paper for?

1090
01:08:55,135 --> 01:08:58,055
Look, you ever keep something
inside yourself?

1091
01:08:58,138 --> 01:09:01,183
But you know you'll let it out.

1092
01:09:01,266 --> 01:09:03,185
I just wanted to get
on solid ground with you.

1093
01:09:03,268 --> 01:09:06,772
I wanted us to know each other
before I told you.

1094
01:09:06,813 --> 01:09:10,192
That's all I wanted.
I wanted to bring it along slowly.

1095
01:09:10,901 --> 01:09:12,861
So you're a cop, huh?

1096
01:09:14,363 --> 01:09:18,659
I'm Frank. Okay?
I'm just Frank.

1097
01:09:19,785 --> 01:09:23,372
Don't lie to me again.
I don't like it.

1098
01:09:32,923 --> 01:09:34,383
Look at these.

1099
01:09:34,424 --> 01:09:35,884
They're so soft.

1100
01:09:35,926 --> 01:09:37,386
They feel like feet.

1101
01:09:37,427 --> 01:09:38,887
They're very subtle.

1102
01:09:38,929 --> 01:09:40,222
Wild, right?

1103
01:09:40,305 --> 01:09:41,723
This girl, you know...

1104
01:09:41,765 --> 01:09:43,934
My girl give them to me.

1105
01:09:44,017 --> 01:09:46,186
Got to wear them, right?

1106
01:09:46,228 --> 01:09:49,189
Pretty jazzy.

1107
01:09:49,231 --> 01:09:51,692
You know,
look at these things.

1108
01:09:51,733 --> 01:09:54,194
She works in a shoe store.

1109
01:09:54,236 --> 01:09:57,072
You never did get her prints.

1110
01:09:57,155 --> 01:10:00,200
She's not the shooter.

1111
01:10:00,242 --> 01:10:01,743
This we know... How?

1112
01:10:01,785 --> 01:10:03,912
I asked her.

1113
01:10:10,002 --> 01:10:11,336
Golden Cadillac.

1114
01:10:11,420 --> 01:10:13,297
Screaming golden Cadillac.

1115
01:10:13,380 --> 01:10:16,091
What makes it scream?

1116
01:10:16,175 --> 01:10:17,926
Getting attacked
by a white Russian.

1117
01:10:18,010 --> 01:10:19,928
That's very clever.

1118
01:10:19,970 --> 01:10:21,722
Make that two.

1119
01:10:21,763 --> 01:10:23,265
Want yours screaming, too?

1120
01:10:23,307 --> 01:10:24,641
You have very tight skin.

1121
01:10:24,725 --> 01:10:26,727
You know that?

1122
01:10:26,810 --> 01:10:28,270
That's 'cause I'm fat.

1123
01:10:28,312 --> 01:10:30,647
It pushes it out
like balloon rubber.

1124
01:10:30,731 --> 01:10:33,317
Did you get that order?

1125
01:10:45,287 --> 01:10:46,830
See you.

1126
01:10:48,749 --> 01:10:50,667
I've seen
eight women tonight.

1127
01:10:50,751 --> 01:10:53,712
I bet every one made
more money than me.

1128
01:10:53,795 --> 01:10:55,172
That blonde...

1129
01:10:55,255 --> 01:10:57,174
she was a school principal.

1130
01:10:57,257 --> 01:11:00,219
How come none of
these women are married?

1131
01:11:00,302 --> 01:11:02,346
How come I'm not married?

1132
01:11:05,766 --> 01:11:09,728
Gentlemen, anyone up for
the Island of Lost Souls?

1133
01:11:09,811 --> 01:11:11,730
No, not me tonight, kids.

1134
01:11:11,813 --> 01:11:13,190
What's the matter, Frank?

1135
01:11:13,273 --> 01:11:14,775
I don't know. I'm tired.

1136
01:11:14,858 --> 01:11:16,693
You tired?

1137
01:11:16,777 --> 01:11:18,695
I'm going to walk home.

1138
01:11:18,779 --> 01:11:20,197
Talk to you tomorrow, kids.

1139
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:21,949
All right, Frank.

1140
01:11:34,211 --> 01:11:36,171
Hey, how you doing?

1141
01:11:36,213 --> 01:11:38,757
Did I wake you? Oh.

1142
01:11:38,841 --> 01:11:41,009
Listen, uh...

1143
01:11:41,093 --> 01:11:43,679
is your daughter asleep?

1144
01:11:43,762 --> 01:11:46,807
You think you can
get somebody to watch her?

1145
01:11:48,225 --> 01:11:49,518
Good.

1146
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:51,019
Uh...

1147
01:11:51,061 --> 01:11:53,021
what do you got on?

1148
01:11:53,063 --> 01:11:54,648
Yeah.

1149
01:11:56,233 --> 01:11:59,069
No, no, take them off.

1150
01:15:21,813 --> 01:15:23,190
Oh!

1151
01:15:27,319 --> 01:15:30,197
I was just, uh...
<i>Sea of Love.</i>

1152
01:15:30,239 --> 01:15:31,740
What?

1153
01:15:31,782 --> 01:15:33,909
You have <i>Sea of Love.</i>

1154
01:15:33,992 --> 01:15:37,120
I haven't looked
in those boxes in years.

1155
01:15:37,204 --> 01:15:40,207
Why, do you
like that record?

1156
01:15:40,290 --> 01:15:42,626
Yeah, I like it.

1157
01:15:42,709 --> 01:15:45,671
I'm saving them
for my daughter.

1158
01:15:45,754 --> 01:15:47,631
Probably worth
a fortune by now.

1159
01:15:47,714 --> 01:15:50,092
They'd fall apart
on the turntable.

1160
01:15:50,133 --> 01:15:52,135
You never play them, huh?

1161
01:15:52,219 --> 01:15:55,639
I don't even know
what's in there anymore.

1162
01:15:55,722 --> 01:15:57,307
You want
something to drink?

1163
01:15:59,893 --> 01:16:02,646
Yeah. Yeah.

1164
01:16:02,729 --> 01:16:05,816
A lot of people
keep records, huh?

1165
01:16:07,192 --> 01:16:09,570
I should have kept mine.

1166
01:16:09,611 --> 01:16:12,656
I had thousands
and thousands of them.

1167
01:16:14,241 --> 01:16:16,326
They'd be
worth something now.

1168
01:17:00,245 --> 01:17:02,164
You better go home...

1169
01:17:02,247 --> 01:17:04,166
before it gets light out.

1170
01:17:04,208 --> 01:17:06,668
Okay. All right.

1171
01:17:06,710 --> 01:17:09,338
I want you to see something.

1172
01:17:16,094 --> 01:17:18,514
Oh, beautiful.

1173
01:17:20,974 --> 01:17:22,351
How would you know?

1174
01:17:22,434 --> 01:17:24,853
You didn't even
look at her.

1175
01:17:24,937 --> 01:17:26,355
What do you mean?

1176
01:17:26,438 --> 01:17:28,357
I didn't want to wake her.

1177
01:17:28,440 --> 01:17:31,985
I wonder what kind of father
you would make.

1178
01:17:32,027 --> 01:17:33,654
Me?

1179
01:17:35,239 --> 01:17:36,907
I don't know.

1180
01:17:36,990 --> 01:17:41,703
You know, who the hell
wants a policeman for a father?

1181
01:17:41,745 --> 01:17:44,831
She's got a father,
doesn't she?

1182
01:17:48,001 --> 01:17:51,672
She does have a father.
You know what I mean?

1183
01:17:59,304 --> 01:18:01,473
Go home.

1184
01:18:04,810 --> 01:18:06,228
He's not dead.

1185
01:18:06,311 --> 01:18:08,063
You're divorced, right?

1186
01:18:08,105 --> 01:18:09,690
Oh, yeah.

1187
01:18:09,773 --> 01:18:11,733
You mad at me?

1188
01:18:11,775 --> 01:18:13,443
No.

1189
01:18:14,611 --> 01:18:16,196
Okay.

1190
01:19:36,818 --> 01:19:39,279
Oh, shit! Fuck.

1191
01:20:30,289 --> 01:20:31,540
Okay.

1192
01:20:33,876 --> 01:20:35,502
Okay.

1193
01:20:37,796 --> 01:20:39,214
Is your mother back?

1194
01:20:39,256 --> 01:20:41,258
Could you stay
with me tonight?

1195
01:20:41,341 --> 01:20:44,469
Good. I've got something
important to discuss.

1196
01:20:44,553 --> 01:20:47,639
Okay? I'm taking you somewhere,
so dress nice.

1197
01:20:47,723 --> 01:20:50,058
Waiter!

1198
01:20:51,643 --> 01:20:53,562
Can I call you back?

1199
01:20:53,604 --> 01:20:55,856
All right.
Okay. Take care.

1200
01:21:00,611 --> 01:21:01,945
How are you doing?

1201
01:21:02,029 --> 01:21:03,780
Something from the bar?

1202
01:21:04,948 --> 01:21:07,910
I know you.
You're that cop.

1203
01:21:07,951 --> 01:21:09,745
You're a police officer?

1204
01:21:09,828 --> 01:21:11,205
Did you get fired?

1205
01:21:11,246 --> 01:21:12,706
This is Gina.

1206
01:21:12,748 --> 01:21:14,374
What do you want?

1207
01:21:14,416 --> 01:21:16,210
Shh! Shh! Shh!

1208
01:21:16,251 --> 01:21:18,086
Just sit down. It's okay.

1209
01:21:18,170 --> 01:21:20,547
This is Gina Gallagher.

1210
01:21:20,589 --> 01:21:23,717
- Hi, Gina.
- This is Detective Sherman Touhey.

1211
01:21:23,800 --> 01:21:25,219
She's good people.

1212
01:21:25,260 --> 01:21:27,095
Hi.

1213
01:21:27,137 --> 01:21:29,223
I'm gone.

1214
01:21:29,306 --> 01:21:32,893
I feel like Betty Fucking
Crocker in this.

1215
01:21:33,101 --> 01:21:35,187
Jesus, it's only 8:00,
and I'm hammered.

1216
01:21:35,270 --> 01:21:37,481
I'm staying here tonight.

1217
01:21:37,523 --> 01:21:39,483
If I leave,
I'll die like a dog.

1218
01:21:39,525 --> 01:21:41,652
It would make
a nice headline.

1219
01:21:41,735 --> 01:21:43,153
I'll call the wife...

1220
01:21:43,237 --> 01:21:45,656
tell her I'll crash
around here.

1221
01:21:46,073 --> 01:21:47,658
Go to the squad room.

1222
01:21:47,741 --> 01:21:50,619
There's this nice cozy
army cot there.

1223
01:21:50,702 --> 01:21:53,914
I got extra keys.
I'm two blocks away.

1224
01:21:53,956 --> 01:21:55,290
We're sleeping together?

1225
01:21:55,374 --> 01:21:58,210
I'm going to see
this Helen later.

1226
01:21:58,794 --> 01:22:00,921
I got this hotel suite.

1227
01:22:00,963 --> 01:22:04,341
An ex-partner is head of security,
so he owes me.

1228
01:22:04,758 --> 01:22:06,385
It'll be a nice surprise.

1229
01:22:06,468 --> 01:22:09,471
You see this guy

1230
01:22:09,555 --> 01:22:13,392
This guy's in love with you

1231
01:22:13,475 --> 01:22:15,644
I'm asking her
to move in with me.

1232
01:22:15,727 --> 01:22:17,437
You just met her.

1233
01:22:17,479 --> 01:22:20,732
I feel like
a fucking teenager.

1234
01:22:36,707 --> 01:22:40,210
The guy says to me,
"Frank, retire".

1235
01:22:40,294 --> 01:22:43,297
I said, "To what?"

1236
01:22:44,798 --> 01:22:48,802
There's nothing
out there after this.

1237
01:22:50,053 --> 01:22:52,598
Could you get
the waiter, please?

1238
01:22:54,766 --> 01:22:58,312
Is there a waiter
in this place?

1239
01:23:00,731 --> 01:23:02,691
So, what's this
important thing...

1240
01:23:02,774 --> 01:23:04,818
you wanted to ask me?

1241
01:23:04,902 --> 01:23:06,445
What? Oh.

1242
01:23:12,326 --> 01:23:15,412
Maybe you should
slow it down, huh?

1243
01:23:15,495 --> 01:23:19,875
Maybe the menu should come
sometime this century.

1244
01:23:23,337 --> 01:23:26,173
What's the big question
you wanted to ask?

1245
01:23:28,842 --> 01:23:30,719
I don't know.

1246
01:23:30,802 --> 01:23:32,221
Waiter. Waiter.

1247
01:23:32,304 --> 01:23:37,559
I feel like I got
the London Philharmonic up my ass.

1248
01:23:40,729 --> 01:23:42,940
Let's go. Come on.

1249
01:23:43,023 --> 01:23:45,025
We just got here.

1250
01:23:45,108 --> 01:23:47,152
I know. Let's get out of here.

1251
01:23:47,236 --> 01:23:48,820
Bad choice.

1252
01:23:49,738 --> 01:23:50,864
Okay.

1253
01:23:50,906 --> 01:23:52,491
Not my favorite place.

1254
01:23:57,079 --> 01:23:58,830
I love this neighborhood.

1255
01:23:59,248 --> 01:24:02,501
I figure the worst
that could happen...

1256
01:24:02,543 --> 01:24:04,336
is I'd trip over
a Perrier bottle.

1257
01:24:04,419 --> 01:24:06,004
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1258
01:24:06,046 --> 01:24:08,006
Could get worse, you know.

1259
01:24:09,258 --> 01:24:10,801
Nicely nice,
this neighborhood, huh?

1260
01:24:10,884 --> 01:24:12,219
Hold it.

1261
01:24:12,261 --> 01:24:13,679
Last year alone...

1262
01:24:13,762 --> 01:24:16,682
we had three murders
right in this block.

1263
01:24:16,765 --> 01:24:19,184
See that garage?
One in there.

1264
01:24:19,268 --> 01:24:22,187
That building? Second floor.
One in there.

1265
01:24:22,271 --> 01:24:25,190
Two months later, third floor.
One in there.

1266
01:24:25,274 --> 01:24:28,777
This town's one big
city of the dead for you, huh?

1267
01:24:28,861 --> 01:24:32,114
City of the dead?
What do you say that for?

1268
01:24:32,197 --> 01:24:34,283
I love life.

1269
01:24:34,366 --> 01:24:37,619
I'm just trying to...
share with them.

1270
01:24:40,372 --> 01:24:43,417
When you live
with a cop...

1271
01:24:43,500 --> 01:24:44,793
tell you this.

1272
01:24:44,835 --> 01:24:47,504
There are certain things,
you know, a cop's eyes.

1273
01:24:47,546 --> 01:24:50,841
What we see.
There's you, what you see...

1274
01:24:50,883 --> 01:24:53,969
which is like nothing, and...

1275
01:24:54,052 --> 01:24:57,681
our eyes, our life,
what we see.

1276
01:24:58,891 --> 01:25:01,435
"If you live with a cop."

1277
01:25:03,729 --> 01:25:05,230
What?

1278
01:25:05,314 --> 01:25:07,649
You said if you live
with a cop.

1279
01:25:07,733 --> 01:25:11,153
You mean if I live
with a cop. Me.

1280
01:25:11,236 --> 01:25:13,155
Have you thought about this?

1281
01:25:13,238 --> 01:25:14,698
I have a kid.

1282
01:25:14,781 --> 01:25:16,200
It's a whole family.

1283
01:25:16,283 --> 01:25:17,659
You get that, right?

1284
01:25:17,743 --> 01:25:20,370
I want to ask you something.

1285
01:25:22,331 --> 01:25:24,791
The singles magazine.

1286
01:25:26,043 --> 01:25:30,214
I don't know, you know?
I mean the dates.

1287
01:25:30,297 --> 01:25:32,674
How can you do that shit?

1288
01:25:32,758 --> 01:25:34,218
I mean, you know...

1289
01:25:34,301 --> 01:25:36,595
go out with guys like that.

1290
01:25:36,678 --> 01:25:38,597
How can you do that?

1291
01:25:38,680 --> 01:25:42,559
You do it. Did you forget
how we met, Frank?

1292
01:25:42,643 --> 01:25:45,437
What's that mean?
I was on a job.

1293
01:25:45,521 --> 01:25:47,981
I was wearing a wire.

1294
01:25:48,065 --> 01:25:49,942
We were going
to drop somebody.

1295
01:25:50,025 --> 01:25:52,319
I'd never do that for real.

1296
01:25:53,028 --> 01:25:54,363
The part about the wire.

1297
01:25:54,446 --> 01:25:56,532
You want to
run that by me again?

1298
01:26:00,702 --> 01:26:01,703
Let me just tell you...

1299
01:26:01,787 --> 01:26:03,664
Fuck you!

1300
01:26:03,705 --> 01:26:05,332
Wait a minute, now.

1301
01:26:05,374 --> 01:26:06,625
I was just... Listen.

1302
01:26:06,667 --> 01:26:08,836
I was just saying that...

1303
01:26:14,132 --> 01:26:15,884
<i>Here's the pitch.</i>

1304
01:26:15,926 --> 01:26:18,345
<i>The ball's hit</i>
<i>to center field!</i>

1305
01:26:18,387 --> 01:26:19,888
What're you having, Frank?

1306
01:26:19,930 --> 01:26:21,348
Double Dewars, Pete.

1307
01:26:21,390 --> 01:26:23,016
You got it.

1308
01:26:56,258 --> 01:26:57,301
Oh, I...

1309
01:26:57,384 --> 01:26:58,719
Is...

1310
01:26:58,760 --> 01:27:01,305
It's 1:00 in the morning.

1311
01:27:03,932 --> 01:27:05,058
I'm Frank.

1312
01:27:06,393 --> 01:27:08,979
I know who you are.

1313
01:27:25,078 --> 01:27:28,665
My mouth ain't working
so good tonight, so, uh...

1314
01:27:33,754 --> 01:27:35,339
all I can say...

1315
01:27:35,422 --> 01:27:37,674
right now is that...

1316
01:27:40,969 --> 01:27:42,846
the circumstances...

1317
01:27:45,933 --> 01:27:47,851
were the circumstances, and...

1318
01:27:50,103 --> 01:27:52,606
No, that's not good enough.

1319
01:27:52,648 --> 01:27:54,024
Okay.

1320
01:27:55,776 --> 01:27:58,695
Okay. The whole thing
is horseshit.

1321
01:27:58,779 --> 01:28:01,698
Know what I mean?
The wire, the job.

1322
01:28:01,782 --> 01:28:04,201
There was no wire, no job,
no nothing.

1323
01:28:04,284 --> 01:28:06,620
I was just... saying that...

1324
01:28:06,662 --> 01:28:08,705
to push you away from me.

1325
01:28:08,789 --> 01:28:12,292
Because I was going to ask you
to live with me.

1326
01:28:12,376 --> 01:28:15,838
And I got...
scared, you know?

1327
01:28:19,258 --> 01:28:20,801
I'm sorry.

1328
01:28:24,304 --> 01:28:25,556
You know...

1329
01:28:25,639 --> 01:28:27,891
you never even told me...

1330
01:28:27,975 --> 01:28:30,060
what your kid's name is.

1331
01:28:33,438 --> 01:28:35,023
Sarah.

1332
01:28:35,941 --> 01:28:36,984
Sarah.

1333
01:28:41,905 --> 01:28:44,366
I would like...

1334
01:28:44,408 --> 01:28:46,493
for the three of us...

1335
01:28:47,911 --> 01:28:49,872
you know...

1336
01:28:49,955 --> 01:28:53,000
to go somewhere...
movie or something.

1337
01:28:54,084 --> 01:28:57,671
Just... take it slow,
you know?

1338
01:29:00,132 --> 01:29:01,175
Helen...

1339
01:29:03,594 --> 01:29:07,055
I can't even sleep
in my own bed anymore...

1340
01:29:07,139 --> 01:29:08,682
unless you're in it.

1341
01:29:11,435 --> 01:29:13,061
I mean...

1342
01:29:13,145 --> 01:29:15,898
I need you
to lie down with me.

1343
01:29:15,939 --> 01:29:20,819
Otherwise, I'm just going to
walk the streets all night.

1344
01:29:25,616 --> 01:29:28,076
Oh, I'm so tired.

1345
01:29:30,120 --> 01:29:33,165
You got to come
lay down with me.

1346
01:29:34,249 --> 01:29:36,001
Helen...

1347
01:29:40,172 --> 01:29:42,591
I got these shoes here.

1348
01:29:42,633 --> 01:29:44,259
See?

1349
01:29:51,767 --> 01:29:53,685
Come back with me, please.

1350
01:30:06,949 --> 01:30:09,535
Let me go tell my mother.

1351
01:30:57,499 --> 01:30:58,709
Frank.

1352
01:30:58,792 --> 01:31:01,253
I didn't want
to wake her up.

1353
01:31:02,796 --> 01:31:06,175
I need some time
to think all this through.

1354
01:31:06,216 --> 01:31:09,636
I think I should
be alone tonight.

1355
01:31:12,014 --> 01:31:13,265
Okay.

1356
01:31:16,935 --> 01:31:18,562
Okay.

1357
01:31:18,645 --> 01:31:20,355
Catch you later.

1358
01:32:10,572 --> 01:32:12,407
Sherman.

1359
01:32:12,449 --> 01:32:13,867
- Frankie?
- Yeah.

1360
01:32:13,909 --> 01:32:17,746
- Frank?
- I forgot you were here.

1361
01:32:21,458 --> 01:32:23,919
You scared the shit out of me.

1362
01:32:23,961 --> 01:32:25,921
I'll stay on the couch.

1363
01:32:25,963 --> 01:32:28,423
Weren't you going
to a hotel?

1364
01:32:28,465 --> 01:32:30,092
It didn't work out.

1365
01:32:30,175 --> 01:32:31,927
What's he doing here?

1366
01:32:33,345 --> 01:32:34,555
Is this his place?

1367
01:32:35,764 --> 01:32:38,559
L... Look, I'll go to
the station house.

1368
01:32:38,600 --> 01:32:41,019
No. I got to talk to you.

1369
01:32:41,103 --> 01:32:43,981
Frank, I never did
nothing like this before.

1370
01:32:44,064 --> 01:32:45,065
That's okay.

1371
01:32:45,107 --> 01:32:48,360
No, listen. I got
to talk to you about this.

1372
01:32:48,443 --> 01:32:50,821
None of this was my idea.

1373
01:32:50,904 --> 01:32:53,824
Gina starts rubbing
my leg under the table.

1374
01:32:53,907 --> 01:32:57,411
You threw the keys.
I told you not to.

1375
01:33:03,250 --> 01:33:04,835
Want to go get her?

1376
01:33:04,918 --> 01:33:06,837
Want me to get her?

1377
01:33:11,091 --> 01:33:14,887
I'm sorry, Sherman. L...
I'm sorry.

1378
01:33:27,316 --> 01:33:28,859
- Thanks, Frank.
- Take care.

1379
01:33:39,912 --> 01:33:43,165
"Catch you later"? Huh?

1380
01:33:43,207 --> 01:33:45,167
What's that supposed to mean?

1381
01:33:45,209 --> 01:33:48,170
Is that some kind
of brush-off, Frank?

1382
01:33:49,213 --> 01:33:50,422
No, not at all.

1383
01:33:52,716 --> 01:33:54,176
No.

1384
01:34:05,062 --> 01:34:07,147
I got something for you.

1385
01:34:08,899 --> 01:34:11,109
Oh, yeah?

1386
01:34:11,902 --> 01:34:12,986
What?

1387
01:34:35,342 --> 01:34:38,595
<i>Mmm mmm </i>

1388
01:34:38,679 --> 01:34:40,931
<i>Mmm mmm </i>

1389
01:34:41,014 --> 01:34:43,892
You were looking at this
like it rang some bells.

1390
01:34:43,976 --> 01:34:47,646
<i>Mmm mmm </i>

1391
01:34:47,729 --> 01:34:49,231
<i>Mmm mmm </i>

1392
01:34:49,314 --> 01:34:50,899
<i>Bum bum bum bum </i>

1393
01:34:50,983 --> 01:34:52,901
<i>Bum-bum bum-bum</i>
<i>Bum-bum </i>

1394
01:34:52,985 --> 01:34:56,196
- Please?
- <i>Come with me </i>

1395
01:34:56,238 --> 01:34:58,323
Want to dance?

1396
01:34:58,407 --> 01:35:01,368
- Okay.
- <i>To the sea </i>

1397
01:35:01,451 --> 01:35:02,995
<i>The sea oflove </i>

1398
01:35:03,078 --> 01:35:04,204
Got something for me?

1399
01:35:04,288 --> 01:35:06,665
<i>I want to tell you </i>

1400
01:35:06,748 --> 01:35:09,710
You got something special
for me tonight, huh?

1401
01:35:09,793 --> 01:35:11,753
Uh-huh. Real special.

1402
01:35:11,837 --> 01:35:13,672
What do you got, Mommy?

1403
01:35:13,755 --> 01:35:16,091
Got something special
for me, Mommy?

1404
01:35:16,175 --> 01:35:17,301
Yeah, special.

1405
01:35:17,384 --> 01:35:20,095
What are you
going to give me?

1406
01:35:20,179 --> 01:35:21,597
Find it.

1407
01:35:21,638 --> 01:35:22,723
Where's it at?

1408
01:35:22,764 --> 01:35:24,474
Find it.

1409
01:35:24,558 --> 01:35:25,559
Here? Hmm?

1410
01:35:25,642 --> 01:35:27,102
Cut it out!

1411
01:35:27,186 --> 01:35:29,229
<i>I want to tell you </i>

1412
01:35:29,271 --> 01:35:30,439
Let's see what's here.

1413
01:35:30,522 --> 01:35:32,608
What?

1414
01:35:34,067 --> 01:35:35,235
Let's see.

1415
01:35:35,319 --> 01:35:37,279
Oh, what's this?

1416
01:35:37,362 --> 01:35:39,907
What... You bring
the fake one, huh?

1417
01:35:39,990 --> 01:35:42,659
You forgot the real one?

1418
01:35:46,455 --> 01:35:47,831
Want to try mine?

1419
01:35:49,499 --> 01:35:52,169
Y-You're crazy.

1420
01:35:52,252 --> 01:35:54,963
Come on.
Let's get it over with.

1421
01:35:55,047 --> 01:35:56,965
I don't want to wait.

1422
01:35:57,007 --> 01:35:58,467
Do it now. Bingo.

1423
01:35:58,550 --> 01:35:59,968
Put it away, please.

1424
01:36:00,010 --> 01:36:01,303
Want to fuck first?

1425
01:36:01,386 --> 01:36:02,971
Get me face down?

1426
01:36:03,055 --> 01:36:04,806
Put the gun away, okay?

1427
01:36:04,848 --> 01:36:07,643
What kind of creep am I?

1428
01:36:07,726 --> 01:36:09,978
The guy who fucks you once...

1429
01:36:10,020 --> 01:36:11,980
and wants
to own you, right?

1430
01:36:12,022 --> 01:36:13,649
What aboutJames Mackey?

1431
01:36:13,732 --> 01:36:15,984
What kind of creep was he?

1432
01:36:16,026 --> 01:36:18,195
That poor bastard in Queens?

1433
01:36:19,112 --> 01:36:22,199
What's his name?
Raymond Brown.

1434
01:36:22,282 --> 01:36:24,785
You fucked him good.

1435
01:36:24,868 --> 01:36:27,788
You've been
following me around?

1436
01:36:29,373 --> 01:36:31,333
Last chance.

1437
01:36:31,375 --> 01:36:34,169
How long you
been following me?

1438
01:36:34,253 --> 01:36:36,630
I haven't been following you.

1439
01:36:36,672 --> 01:36:38,882
How do you know
about them?

1440
01:36:38,966 --> 01:36:42,302
It's my job.
It's what I'm paid for.

1441
01:36:42,344 --> 01:36:46,139
I didn't sleep with those guys.
They were just dates.

1442
01:36:46,181 --> 01:36:47,474
Shut up!

1443
01:36:47,516 --> 01:36:49,893
I slept with Mackey!
Big deal! He didn't...

1444
01:36:49,977 --> 01:36:52,145
I don't care!

1445
01:36:53,647 --> 01:36:56,149
Why'd you do it, Helen?

1446
01:36:57,693 --> 01:37:00,028
Tell me why you did it.

1447
01:37:00,070 --> 01:37:03,031
Tell me you did it.
Tell me why you did it.

1448
01:37:03,115 --> 01:37:06,034
I want to know everything,
all right?

1449
01:37:06,076 --> 01:37:08,120
Come on. Talk to me.

1450
01:37:11,039 --> 01:37:13,542
Look. I'm wearing your shoes.

1451
01:37:14,877 --> 01:37:17,004
Talk to me. Come on.

1452
01:37:18,213 --> 01:37:20,048
Talk to me.

1453
01:37:20,132 --> 01:37:21,341
Look.

1454
01:37:21,425 --> 01:37:24,136
The arresting officer
was fucking the doer!

1455
01:37:24,219 --> 01:37:25,554
See? It's a joke.

1456
01:37:25,596 --> 01:37:29,183
It won't go to trial even.
You understand?

1457
01:37:30,225 --> 01:37:34,438
Talk to me. Come on.
Come on!

1458
01:37:40,527 --> 01:37:43,030
Helen. Please.

1459
01:37:44,239 --> 01:37:45,866
Talk to me.

1460
01:37:55,375 --> 01:37:57,252
Get out.

1461
01:37:59,421 --> 01:38:01,048
Come on.

1462
01:38:01,131 --> 01:38:02,799
Go ahead. Okay?

1463
01:38:47,469 --> 01:38:49,596
- Helen?
- Aah!

1464
01:38:52,933 --> 01:38:54,309
I know you!

1465
01:38:57,145 --> 01:38:59,106
You fucking swinging dick!

1466
01:38:59,147 --> 01:39:01,984
You got in deep, man!

1467
01:39:02,025 --> 01:39:04,695
She throws a fucking
court order at me!

1468
01:39:04,778 --> 01:39:06,530
It's not your family!

1469
01:39:06,613 --> 01:39:09,116
It's not your daughter!

1470
01:39:09,157 --> 01:39:10,534
Oh! God!

1471
01:39:18,917 --> 01:39:21,336
Don't! Don't!

1472
01:39:22,671 --> 01:39:23,714
Don't!

1473
01:39:25,924 --> 01:39:27,259
Go!

1474
01:39:29,219 --> 01:39:30,679
On the bed!

1475
01:39:30,721 --> 01:39:34,183
Get down on the bed, man.
Get down.

1476
01:39:34,266 --> 01:39:37,519
Did you have a good time
with her last night?

1477
01:39:37,603 --> 01:39:39,688
Who do you mean?

1478
01:39:39,771 --> 01:39:42,482
Who? Who?
You a fucking owl?

1479
01:39:42,566 --> 01:39:45,027
I don't know who
you're talking about.

1480
01:39:45,068 --> 01:39:49,156
I'm talking about my wife.
My wife Helen.

1481
01:39:49,198 --> 01:39:51,158
You remember her,
don't you, huh?

1482
01:39:51,200 --> 01:39:52,659
I don't know. Look...

1483
01:39:52,701 --> 01:39:55,871
- I'm a New York City...
- I know who you are.

1484
01:39:55,954 --> 01:39:57,998
Show me how you
did it to her!

1485
01:39:58,081 --> 01:40:00,375
- I didn't.
- Uh-huh! Uh-huh!

1486
01:40:00,417 --> 01:40:02,628
You show me,
and I'll let you go.

1487
01:40:02,711 --> 01:40:04,213
I didn't do anything.

1488
01:40:04,296 --> 01:40:05,756
Show me what you did to her!

1489
01:40:05,839 --> 01:40:08,217
- Show me!
- We didn't do anything.

1490
01:40:09,218 --> 01:40:10,844
Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.

1491
01:40:10,928 --> 01:40:12,095
Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

1492
01:40:12,179 --> 01:40:14,681
This? You mean this?

1493
01:40:14,765 --> 01:40:16,850
- Okay?
- Fucking bastard!

1494
01:40:18,352 --> 01:40:20,854
Get... Get your clothes off!

1495
01:40:20,896 --> 01:40:22,397
Get your clothes off!

1496
01:40:23,148 --> 01:40:24,525
Take your fucking... Aah!

1497
01:40:47,047 --> 01:40:50,217
- Aah!
- Don't fucking move!

1498
01:40:52,302 --> 01:40:53,679
Put it down!

1499
01:40:55,472 --> 01:40:57,307
Put it down!

1500
01:40:58,892 --> 01:41:00,310
On the floor!

1501
01:41:00,394 --> 01:41:02,437
On the floor!

1502
01:41:02,521 --> 01:41:04,231
Hands behind the head! Move!

1503
01:41:04,273 --> 01:41:05,774
Get them on there!

1504
01:41:07,109 --> 01:41:08,735
Don't ever fucking move!

1505
01:41:10,279 --> 01:41:12,698
- Okay. Okay.
- What are you going to do...

1506
01:41:12,781 --> 01:41:15,117
Lock me up and
throw away the key?

1507
01:41:15,158 --> 01:41:17,327
Shut the fuck up!

1508
01:41:17,411 --> 01:41:19,413
It ain't going to work!

1509
01:41:19,496 --> 01:41:22,082
It's not your wife!

1510
01:41:22,124 --> 01:41:23,667
It... It's not your family!

1511
01:41:23,750 --> 01:41:24,918
What are you doing?

1512
01:41:24,960 --> 01:41:26,336
Aah!

1513
01:41:26,420 --> 01:41:27,588
No!

1514
01:42:02,539 --> 01:42:05,334
Aah!

1515
01:42:17,596 --> 01:42:20,516
I hadn't seen him
in about a year.

1516
01:42:20,599 --> 01:42:23,727
I thought
he was gone for good.

1517
01:42:51,046 --> 01:42:52,506
Oh, yeah. That's it.

1518
01:42:52,548 --> 01:42:54,007
That's the stuff.

1519
01:42:54,049 --> 01:42:56,176
This is on the house.

1520
01:43:02,683 --> 01:43:04,685
You don't want to get up.

1521
01:43:07,271 --> 01:43:08,772
Come here.

1522
01:43:08,856 --> 01:43:10,107
How you doing, sport?

1523
01:43:10,190 --> 01:43:11,567
Good to see you.

1524
01:43:11,650 --> 01:43:13,569
I'm doing better than you.

1525
01:43:13,652 --> 01:43:15,571
What are you drinking, scotch?

1526
01:43:15,654 --> 01:43:18,407
No. A club soda and lime.

1527
01:43:18,448 --> 01:43:19,658
Club soda and lime.

1528
01:43:19,741 --> 01:43:21,076
Club soda and lime?

1529
01:43:21,159 --> 01:43:22,703
What a cheap date.

1530
01:43:22,744 --> 01:43:24,705
Oh, it's the new me.

1531
01:43:24,746 --> 01:43:27,082
Here's to the new you
and the old me.

1532
01:43:30,127 --> 01:43:32,296
Mmm.

1533
01:43:32,379 --> 01:43:33,755
Mmm.

1534
01:43:33,839 --> 01:43:36,133
Rub it in, rub it in.

1535
01:43:38,051 --> 01:43:39,219
How you doing, Frank?

1536
01:43:39,303 --> 01:43:40,762
Hanging in, hanging out.

1537
01:43:40,846 --> 01:43:42,890
- I'm with the 1-9 now.
- Yeah?

1538
01:43:42,931 --> 01:43:44,683
You?

1539
01:43:44,766 --> 01:43:48,187
Same old. That was
a hard job to top.

1540
01:43:48,270 --> 01:43:49,688
I hear that.

1541
01:43:49,771 --> 01:43:52,107
Wildest ride I was ever on.

1542
01:43:52,149 --> 01:43:56,528
You know, I, uh,
followed up that nutbag.

1543
01:43:56,612 --> 01:43:57,988
The husband Terry?

1544
01:43:58,071 --> 01:44:01,909
Turns out he'd been
shadowing her for eight months.

1545
01:44:01,950 --> 01:44:03,035
Can you believe it?

1546
01:44:03,118 --> 01:44:04,244
Jesus.

1547
01:44:05,287 --> 01:44:06,330
Man.

1548
01:44:08,123 --> 01:44:11,001
She always had
that edge, you know?

1549
01:44:11,084 --> 01:44:14,004
Like she smelled him,
sensed him, or something.

1550
01:44:14,087 --> 01:44:16,507
I must have sensed him, too.

1551
01:44:16,590 --> 01:44:19,009
Wonder what she saw in him.

1552
01:44:19,092 --> 01:44:20,511
I don't know.

1553
01:44:20,594 --> 01:44:22,554
What does anybody
see in anybody?

1554
01:44:25,140 --> 01:44:28,268
People are work, brother.
A lot of work.

1555
01:44:30,312 --> 01:44:31,688
Too much work.

1556
01:44:31,772 --> 01:44:33,482
Ever see her again?

1557
01:44:35,901 --> 01:44:37,486
Well, I tried, but...

1558
01:44:39,196 --> 01:44:40,781
she didn't want to.

1559
01:44:43,909 --> 01:44:45,327
Can you blame her?

1560
01:44:45,410 --> 01:44:48,288
I'm in bed with her,
making love...

1561
01:44:48,330 --> 01:44:50,958
I'm out of bed,
I'm stalking her, like...

1562
01:44:51,041 --> 01:44:55,671
She had that nutcase over one
shoulder, me over the other.

1563
01:44:55,754 --> 01:44:56,880
Come on.

1564
01:44:58,423 --> 01:45:00,467
Can you blame her?

1565
01:45:01,927 --> 01:45:05,472
Yeah, right.
I'm going to let her go.

1566
01:45:09,726 --> 01:45:12,688
I ran her through
a wringer, man.

1567
01:45:12,729 --> 01:45:13,981
You know?

1568
01:45:15,399 --> 01:45:18,485
Hey, what am I
supposed to do?

1569
01:45:21,238 --> 01:45:23,323
She'd tear my head off.

1570
01:45:24,867 --> 01:45:26,994
What are you looking at?

1571
01:45:55,772 --> 01:45:58,358
- How you doing?
- Just great.

1572
01:45:58,400 --> 01:46:01,528
Good. How's, uh...
How's your daughter?

1573
01:46:01,612 --> 01:46:03,155
She's fine.

1574
01:46:03,238 --> 01:46:04,656
Oh, good, good.

1575
01:46:04,740 --> 01:46:07,326
I'm working out
of the 1-9 now.

1576
01:46:07,409 --> 01:46:09,161
That's this area here.

1577
01:46:09,244 --> 01:46:12,164
We had a series of break-ins
around here.

1578
01:46:12,247 --> 01:46:15,709
You've been okay? Your shop's
wired to the precinct?

1579
01:46:15,751 --> 01:46:17,252
Yep.

1580
01:46:17,336 --> 01:46:22,174
Yeah. Well, uh, listen,
the reason I come by is I, uh...

1581
01:46:22,257 --> 01:46:24,676
I wanted you
to meet somebody.

1582
01:46:24,760 --> 01:46:27,262
Oh? Who, Frank?

1583
01:46:27,346 --> 01:46:30,849
Well, actually, I'd very much like
to introduce myself to you.

1584
01:46:30,933 --> 01:46:34,311
Yeah? Who are you this week,
a fighter pilot?

1585
01:46:34,394 --> 01:46:37,481
Fighter pilot? No.
No more surprises.

1586
01:46:37,564 --> 01:46:40,484
No more... lies.

1587
01:46:40,567 --> 01:46:41,944
I'm... I'm all here.

1588
01:46:42,027 --> 01:46:45,447
Right. The circumstances are
no longer the circumstances, huh?

1589
01:46:45,531 --> 01:46:48,617
I hung fire to be with you
through that.

1590
01:46:48,700 --> 01:46:50,327
There's a lot I don't know.

1591
01:46:50,410 --> 01:46:52,579
You got to give me
a chance.

1592
01:46:52,663 --> 01:46:56,625
You never really got
to know me. Not 100%.

1593
01:46:56,708 --> 01:46:59,127
The person you
got involved with...

1594
01:46:59,211 --> 01:47:01,129
that was half of me.

1595
01:47:01,213 --> 01:47:05,133
You owe it to yourself.
Check out the complete person.

1596
01:47:05,175 --> 01:47:08,637
Cut the crap, okay?
I had a rough day.

1597
01:47:08,679 --> 01:47:12,140
What'll I do, follow you
all over the city?

1598
01:47:12,224 --> 01:47:15,143
How do I get
over with you now?

1599
01:47:15,185 --> 01:47:17,271
Get over with me?

1600
01:47:17,312 --> 01:47:18,564
After what you did...

1601
01:47:18,647 --> 01:47:21,066
you're looking
to get over with me?

1602
01:47:21,149 --> 01:47:22,526
It couldn't be helped.

1603
01:47:22,609 --> 01:47:24,027
I couldn't help that.

1604
01:47:24,111 --> 01:47:26,989
It's killing me
not seeing you.

1605
01:47:27,030 --> 01:47:28,657
It's killing me.

1606
01:47:28,740 --> 01:47:31,618
How do you think
it makes me feel?

1607
01:47:31,660 --> 01:47:33,912
I don't know.
How do you...

1608
01:47:33,996 --> 01:47:35,873
How's it make you feel?

1609
01:47:35,956 --> 01:47:37,875
It doesn't make any difference.

1610
01:47:37,958 --> 01:47:40,043
I'm moving back home anyway.

1611
01:47:41,253 --> 01:47:42,838
Back to York?

1612
01:47:44,423 --> 01:47:47,759
That's fantastic.
Because just this morning...

1613
01:47:47,843 --> 01:47:50,846
I got offered a job in York,
Pennsylvania. Police department.

1614
01:47:50,929 --> 01:47:53,849
They want me to head
this huge, uh...

1615
01:47:53,932 --> 01:47:56,852
Break up this huge
counterfeit produce ring.

1616
01:47:56,935 --> 01:47:59,855
Hey, listen!
This is fantastic, you know?

1617
01:47:59,938 --> 01:48:02,649
- Look. Look, tell you what.
- What?

1618
01:48:02,691 --> 01:48:05,861
I'll take the job now.
All right?

1619
01:48:05,944 --> 01:48:08,363
You could help me out there.

1620
01:48:08,447 --> 01:48:10,866
Do you know
any nice apartments...

1621
01:48:10,949 --> 01:48:13,702
houses, stuff
that I could, uh...

1622
01:48:13,785 --> 01:48:15,370
Okay, enough, Frank.

1623
01:48:15,454 --> 01:48:16,663
Enough.

1624
01:48:16,747 --> 01:48:19,082
No, really!
When are you going?

1625
01:48:19,166 --> 01:48:20,709
You're not going?

1626
01:48:22,002 --> 01:48:23,545
You're staying here, right?

1627
01:48:28,133 --> 01:48:30,219
I've been on the wagon...

1628
01:48:31,178 --> 01:48:32,679
for seven weeks now.

1629
01:48:37,059 --> 01:48:38,894
You still drink coffee?

1630
01:48:38,936 --> 01:48:42,314
Oh! Like it's going out of style.

1631
01:48:44,107 --> 01:48:47,361
I'll buy you a cup,
if you like.

1632
01:48:49,112 --> 01:48:52,282
Come with me

1633
01:48:53,408 --> 01:48:57,371
To the sea

1634
01:48:57,454 --> 01:48:59,748
Oh, yeah

1635
01:49:01,291 --> 01:49:05,838
Oh, do you remember
the night we met

1636
01:49:05,921 --> 01:49:10,551
Ooh, that's the night
I just knew you were my pet

1637
01:49:10,592 --> 01:49:14,054
I wanna tell you
how much I love you

1638
01:49:14,137 --> 01:49:17,683
Oh, I'm down here
on the sea of love

1639
01:49:21,019 --> 01:49:25,232
