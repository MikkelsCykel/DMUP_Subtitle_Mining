00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:42,792
Hey, take it easy!

2
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:45,295
Hey, who's the big
birthday girl, huh?

3
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:48,298
Oh, boy. How old are youme! I'm this.

4
00:00:48,333 --> 00:00:51,801
Call me when you're this, okayhere we go.

5
00:00:51,836 --> 00:00:54,187
You got it straight, okay?
Hold it there.

6
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:56,806
Beautiful, beautiful!
Okay!

7
00:01:05,448 --> 00:01:08,952
Hey, what happened here?
What's the matter, huh?

8
00:01:08,987 --> 00:01:12,455
Johnny hit me.
He don't like me anymore.

9
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:15,458
Oh, i know what
you're goin' through.

10
00:01:15,493 --> 00:01:17,961
You gave him the best
three months of your life, huh?

11
00:01:17,996 --> 00:01:20,463
Then he left you
for a pail and shovel.

12
00:01:20,964 --> 00:01:23,466
What do you see in him, anyway?
What are you in love with?

13
00:01:23,501 --> 00:01:28,972
He's not in your class. He's afraid
of the dark. He wets his pants.

14
00:01:29,007 --> 00:01:32,976
When he eats, he gets food all
over his face. He's a mama's boy.

15
00:01:33,011 --> 00:01:34,978
What are you,
in nursery school now?

16
00:01:35,013 --> 00:01:39,983
I guarantee you, by the time you get to
kindergarten, you'll forget all about him.

17
00:01:40,018 --> 00:01:42,986
Hey, look who's here! Show
time! Bobby bunny, huh?

18
00:01:46,524 --> 00:01:49,993
Here we go, let's go.
Bobby bunny's here-

19
00:01:50,028 --> 00:01:52,996
what's that?
Oh, nothing, nothing.

20
00:01:53,496 --> 00:01:57,000
Bobby bunny just dropped
a few carrots, that's all.

21
00:02:07,545 --> 00:02:11,014
You don't have to talk
all night?

22
00:02:11,049 --> 00:02:14,017
I'm a man
who can't say no?

23
00:02:14,052 --> 00:02:17,520
You don't have
to twist my arm?

24
00:02:17,555 --> 00:02:20,023
Just point me
where you wanna go?

25
00:02:20,058 --> 00:02:23,526
Take me to the action
take me to the track?

26
00:02:23,561 --> 00:02:26,029
Take me to a party if
they're bettin' in the back?

27
00:02:26,064 --> 00:02:30,033
I've been workin' all my life
can't afford to wait?

28
00:02:30,068 --> 00:02:33,036
Let me call my wife so i
can tell her i'll be late?

29
00:02:33,071 --> 00:02:36,039
I want the easy
mmm?

30
00:02:36,074 --> 00:02:39,042
Easy, easy money?

31
00:02:39,077 --> 00:02:42,045
I could get lucky?

32
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,548
Oh, things could go right?

33
00:02:46,049 --> 00:02:49,052
I want the easy?

34
00:02:49,087 --> 00:02:52,055
Easy, easy money?

35
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:55,558
Maybe this one time?

36
00:02:55,593 --> 00:02:58,561
Maybe tonight?

37
00:03:03,566 --> 00:03:07,070
You don't have to try
too hard?

38
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:10,573
I don't need
a song and dance?

39
00:03:10,608 --> 00:03:14,077
I don't need
an invitation?

40
00:03:14,112 --> 00:03:16,079
If you've got
a game of chance?

41
00:03:16,114 --> 00:03:19,582
Take me to the tables
take me to the fights?

42
00:03:19,617 --> 00:03:22,585
Run me like a numbers
roll me like a dice?

43
00:03:23,086 --> 00:03:26,089
When you're countin' on a
killin' always count me in?

44
00:03:26,124 --> 00:03:29,092
Talk me into losing
just as long as i can win?

45
00:03:29,127 --> 00:03:32,095
I want the easy?

46
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:35,098
Easy, easy money?

47
00:03:35,598 --> 00:03:38,101
I want the good times?

48
00:03:38,136 --> 00:03:42,105
Oh, i never had?

49
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:44,607
I want the easy?

50
00:03:44,642 --> 00:03:47,110
Mmm, easy money?

51
00:03:47,145 --> 00:03:51,614
Oh, i want the good life?

52
00:03:51,649 --> 00:03:54,617
Mmm, i want it bad?

53
00:03:54,652 --> 00:03:57,120
Easy money?

54
00:03:57,155 --> 00:03:59,122
You say i fool myself?

55
00:03:59,157 --> 00:04:02,125
But better me than being
a fool for someone else?

56
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:07,630
I got a hot slot machine
of a system ready to go?

57
00:04:07,665 --> 00:04:10,633
Easy money?

58
00:04:10,668 --> 00:04:15,638
I got a one-track mind and a
good reputation layin' on the line?

59
00:04:15,673 --> 00:04:18,141
I'll either come back
a bum or a king?

60
00:04:18,176 --> 00:04:21,761
Baby, i don't know?

61
00:05:15,698 --> 00:05:17,700
Let's go over today's schedule.

62
00:05:17,735 --> 00:05:21,204
It is exactly 6:33.

63
00:05:21,239 --> 00:05:24,207
It is exactly 6:34.

64
00:05:24,707 --> 00:05:29,212
At 7:00, we're meeting with the head of the
furniture department regarding inventory.

65
00:05:29,247 --> 00:05:34,217
Postpone the meeting. Double-check the
inventory, and fire the cleaning staff.

66
00:05:34,717 --> 00:05:36,719
7:20, you will crush the hopes
of the loading dock workers...

67
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:39,222
regarding better
working conditions.

68
00:05:39,257 --> 00:05:41,224
Cancel the meeting,
and send out a memorandum...

69
00:05:41,259 --> 00:05:43,726
that the working conditions
at the loading dock...

70
00:05:43,761 --> 00:05:47,730
will remain as they have for
the past 35 years. Mm-hmm.

71
00:05:48,231 --> 00:05:50,233
At 7:30, we'll be meeting
with the accountants...

72
00:05:50,268 --> 00:05:52,735
regarding donations and
charitable contributions.

73
00:05:53,236 --> 00:05:57,240
Cancel that meeting, and
cancel my check to boy's town.

74
00:05:57,275 --> 00:05:59,242
What time
is scrappleton coming?

75
00:05:59,277 --> 00:06:03,746
Uh, 7:50, with the legal
papers you requested.

76
00:06:03,781 --> 00:06:07,250
As soon as you finish with scrappleton,
we leave for staten island...

77
00:06:07,285 --> 00:06:09,252
to attend your granddaughter
allison's wedding.

78
00:06:09,287 --> 00:06:13,256
Well, i hope she's made a better choice...

79
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:15,758
than her mother did!

80
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:19,379
Jesus! Rose!

81
00:06:19,414 --> 00:06:22,382
How did you talk me
into this?

82
00:06:22,417 --> 00:06:25,885
You should use allison.
She's the one has to wear it.

83
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:29,389
It's unlucky for the bride to wear
her gown before the wedding day.

84
00:06:29,424 --> 00:06:33,393
How unlucky can she getlook who she's
marrying. You shouldn't talk like that.

85
00:06:33,428 --> 00:06:35,895
Julio's a good boy.
Come on, rose, will ya?

86
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:38,398
See the guy for what he is.
He belongs to a gang.

87
00:06:38,433 --> 00:06:41,901
It's a good boy's gang.
They help people.

88
00:06:41,936 --> 00:06:45,905
- Ooh, take it easy, will ya?
- Oh, i'm sorry. Where'd i get you?

89
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:49,409
If i show you, we'll never
get outta here. Hold still.

90
00:06:49,444 --> 00:06:52,912
I've gotta finish this. You gotta pick
up the cake, and mother will be here soon.

91
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:56,416
Your mother.

92
00:06:56,451 --> 00:06:59,919
I gotta go to the john.
Monty! Oh, the dress!

93
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:03,923
No, you're wonderful.
Allison, i need the phone.

94
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:07,427
I'm in here.
Get outta there!

95
00:07:07,462 --> 00:07:09,929
Get off, will ya?
I am so hung up on you.

96
00:07:09,964 --> 00:07:12,932
Good idea.
I'll see you in church.

97
00:07:12,967 --> 00:07:15,935
Daddy! Don't worry, you won't lose him.

98
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:18,438
Belinda, let's go.

99
00:07:18,473 --> 00:07:21,441
Someday i'll be out
of your life.

100
00:07:21,476 --> 00:07:23,943
Yeah, but right now
get outta the bathroom.

101
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:42,962
It's the best thing
about having daughters.

102
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:01,481
Nicky boy, it's monty.

103
00:08:01,516 --> 00:08:03,483
Close the door.

104
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:05,985
Yeah?

105
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:08,488
Nicky, rose's mother,
she's on her way over.

106
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:11,491
So?
What do you want from me?

107
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:15,995
I need the truck. I gotta pick up the
wedding cake. What am i, allied vans?

108
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:17,997
You really know how
to push a friendship.

109
00:08:18,032 --> 00:08:22,001
When's the last time you did something
for meyou got a short memory.

110
00:08:22,036 --> 00:08:25,004
Who drove to atlantic city to
bail you out when you owed $400?

111
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,507
At belmont, you had
four losers in a row.

112
00:08:27,542 --> 00:08:31,010
Who gave you the winner in the
fifththe cake's for your godchild!

113
00:08:31,045 --> 00:08:34,013
All right, all right. Give
me a chance. I'm comin'.

114
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:49,028
Where's my stuffby the
front door. What's the rush?

115
00:08:49,063 --> 00:08:53,032
I gotta go to work. I got a wedding
to pay for. Don't forget the cake.

116
00:08:53,067 --> 00:08:57,036
How many years you know me?
Did i ever forget anything?

117
00:08:57,071 --> 00:09:00,039
Nicky, just in time.
Beautiful!

118
00:09:00,074 --> 00:09:04,043
I don't wanna see her fucking
- mother!

119
00:09:06,178 --> 00:09:09,682
- Was it nicky?
- No, no. It's not nicky. No.

120
00:09:11,183 --> 00:09:16,188
Oh, it's mother! Leave him,
dear. Simply walk out on him.

121
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:19,692
His entire body is
bloodshot. He'll never change.

122
00:09:20,192 --> 00:09:22,194
Nice to see you too.

123
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:26,699
It's gonna be so much fun having
everyone here. Yeah, a lot of fun.

124
00:09:26,734 --> 00:09:30,703
Well, if it isn't my favorite
relative. Don't start that bullshit.

125
00:09:31,203 --> 00:09:34,707
Monty, please bring
mother's luggage upstairs.

126
00:09:34,742 --> 00:09:39,211
What's clive, a footstool?
No, no, monty, let me get this.

127
00:09:41,213 --> 00:09:45,217
How can you stand him?
You gotta get to know him.

128
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:47,219
The wedding
is gonna be wonderful.

129
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:51,724
We never get to see you. The
store takes up all my time.

130
00:09:54,727 --> 00:09:58,230
Mother, why do you push yourself
so hardthe money doesn't matter.

131
00:09:58,265 --> 00:10:02,735
When your father was alive,
he ran monahan's like a tyrant.

132
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:04,737
He paid the help
next to nothing.

133
00:10:04,772 --> 00:10:07,740
- He drove them like sled dogs.
- Wonderful man.

134
00:10:07,775 --> 00:10:11,744
Wonderful! Now that he's
gone, i carry on his work.

135
00:10:12,244 --> 00:10:13,746
Rose,

136
00:10:13,781 --> 00:10:18,751
i don't know how you can live
with that... man.

137
00:10:18,786 --> 00:10:21,253
We're happy
just the way we are.

138
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:25,257
Happyyeah, we were
until a few minutes ago.

139
00:10:25,758 --> 00:10:28,260
And we don't want a dime
from you. You understand?

140
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:30,763
No offense.

141
00:10:30,798 --> 00:10:33,766
No offense?

142
00:10:33,801 --> 00:10:34,767
No offense?

143
00:10:35,267 --> 00:10:37,770
You are an offense!

144
00:10:37,805 --> 00:10:40,773
Why, you can
barely walk erect.

145
00:10:40,808 --> 00:10:44,777
You pollute the air
with your smoking.

146
00:10:44,812 --> 00:10:48,280
You reek of liquor and god knows what
else. You're an ecological menace!

147
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:51,784
You were the inspiration for twin
beds. I'll tell you something else.

148
00:10:52,284 --> 00:10:55,788
Don't start with mother. I'm not
startin' nothin'. It never ended.

149
00:10:55,823 --> 00:10:59,792
And to think of who you could
have married. Pat flannigan.

150
00:10:59,827 --> 00:11:03,295
Don't start throwing up the
guys she could've married.

151

154
00:11:12,805 --> 00:11:16,809

gonna talk about me when i'm gone.

156
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:35,945
Where do you live, in
vermontwhat took you so long?

157
00:11:47,089 --> 00:11:49,592
Why do you let her mother
get to you?

158
00:11:49,627 --> 00:11:52,595
Forget about her,
will ya?

159
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:55,598
She never wanted rose
to marry me. Never.

160
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:01,604
She says i drink too much,
i smoke too much, i gamble.

161
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:05,107
She's right, but what am i

163
00:12:09,612 --> 00:12:12,114
Nah, we know i got class.

164
00:12:12,149 --> 00:12:16,118
It's a certain word. What's the
word for someone who can't say "no"?

165
00:12:16,153 --> 00:12:18,621
Sonya. Not sonya. No, not sonya.

166
00:12:18,656 --> 00:12:21,123

lookin' for. I got no willpower.

168
00:12:25,663 --> 00:12:28,130
Yeah, willpower.

169
00:12:28,165 --> 00:12:30,132
Make a left on elm.
I got a quick shoot.

170
00:12:30,167 --> 00:12:32,134
You didn't say anything
about a shoot.

171
00:12:32,169 --> 00:12:34,637
Leave me alone. I got enough
problems. Just take a left on elm.

172
00:12:34,672 --> 00:12:38,641
I got a quick shoot. I'll be quick.
You can help me. Well, thanks.

173
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:41,260
You really think
i got no class?

174
00:12:41,295 --> 00:12:43,262
No, i don't think
you gotnoclass.

175
00:12:43,646 --> 00:12:47,149
I'm gonna be sad. Mmmmm. Very good!

176
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:50,152
Now, i'm gonna be a
monster. Watch this. Grrrrr.

177
00:12:50,187 --> 00:12:52,154
Now the big one.

178
00:12:52,655 --> 00:12:55,157
Okay, the big one.
Can you be happy?

179
00:12:55,192 --> 00:12:58,160
That's a good one!
Okay, be happy.

180
00:12:58,195 --> 00:13:00,663
Okay, here goes.
Smile pretty.

181
00:13:00,698 --> 00:13:02,915
Beautiful!
We got it.

182
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:14,543
The other door. The other door! I got it.

183
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:26,555
Get outta here.

184
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:29,058
Oooh!
Oh!

185
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:37,066
The cake, the cake!

186
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:46,575
Watch out for the top.
I'm watching, i'm watching.

187
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:51,580
It's not gonna slide around in there?
No, i got it wedged against a toilet.

188
00:13:57,219 --> 00:14:00,222
Just great.
My favorite system a lock.

189
00:14:00,257 --> 00:14:02,725
And i got monty in the truck
with a wedding cake.

190
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,727
I gotta pick up my mother,
take her to the beauty parlor.

191
00:14:05,227 --> 00:14:08,230
What's the tip?
Big boy in the fifth.

192
00:14:08,731 --> 00:14:11,734
Forget it!
The fifth goes off at 3:00.

193
00:14:11,769 --> 00:14:15,738
- We goin' to the track?
- I can't go. I got a bar to run.

194
00:14:15,773 --> 00:14:17,239
This here's a sure thing.

195
00:14:17,274 --> 00:14:20,242
It's forty to one.
Hey!

196
00:14:20,277 --> 00:14:23,245
Wake up, we're closing up.
I didn't finish my drink.

197
00:14:23,746 --> 00:14:27,116
You're finished now. Get
outta here. Here's your dollar.

198
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:34,623
Come on, we've got
five minutes to post.

199
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:43,132
Hey! Get the hell
out of there!

200
00:14:43,167 --> 00:14:45,634
Slow down.
They're kids.

201
00:14:45,669 --> 00:14:50,139
Nicky, take care of it.

202
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:57,646
What're you doing?

203
00:15:02,186 --> 00:15:04,153
Sixty seconds to post time.

204
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:06,906
You're next.
What?

205
00:15:06,941 --> 00:15:08,407
Are you gonna place a bet?

206
00:15:08,442 --> 00:15:13,412
Oh, yes, yes. I'd like the
number... seven horse please.

207
00:15:13,447 --> 00:15:15,915
Thirty seconds to post time.

208
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:21,420
I'd like to put two dollars
to win, two dollars to place...

209
00:15:21,455 --> 00:15:25,424
and two dollars to show.
Okay, buddy, good luck.

210
00:15:25,459 --> 00:15:29,929
The next time you bet,
remember, instead of saying...

211
00:15:29,964 --> 00:15:33,933
fifteen seconds to post time. Two dollars to
win, two dollars to place, two dollars to show,

212
00:15:33,968 --> 00:15:35,935
just say,
"two across the board."

213
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:40,439
Gee, instead
- what are you buyin', a house?

214
00:15:40,474 --> 00:15:42,942
Let's go while we're young.

215
00:15:42,977 --> 00:15:44,944
We're gonna get
shut out!

216
00:15:44,979 --> 00:15:50,449
I have a friend that wants to bet the
number seven horse. Two seconds to post time.

217
00:15:50,484 --> 00:15:53,452
Number six horse.
Six horse.

218
00:15:53,585 --> 00:15:57,089
No more bets.

219
00:15:57,124 --> 00:16:00,092
And they're off!

220
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:06,966
Here they go! Nicky, come
on. We're goin' to the rail.

221
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:10,469
Big boy making up lots of ground
on the outside,

222
00:16:10,504 --> 00:16:13,472
moving to the fourth spot.

223
00:16:13,507 --> 00:16:15,975
Here comes big boy
on the extreme outside.

224
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:18,360
How's he doin'?

225
00:16:18,395 --> 00:16:21,864
Gettin' farther ahead all
the time. Gimme those things.

226
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:24,867
Five lengths ahead!

227
00:16:25,367 --> 00:16:27,369
Fifty bucks
at forty to one!

228
00:16:27,404 --> 00:16:29,872
That's two grand apiece!
Two grand!

229
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:36,378
You dragged me out here!
I love ya, i love ya!

230
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:49,008
That's two grand apiece!

231
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:55,514
I'm goin' to hawaii! I'm goin'
to hawaii! He's fallin' back.

232
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:58,517
I'm not goin' to hawaii!

233
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:02,021
He's too far ahead
to lose.

234
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,032
He thinks he's water skiing!

235
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:18,170
We were in. What happened?
Yeah, there's our winner.

236
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:21,673
I closed my bar!
Get outta here!

237
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:24,676
I'll kill you.

238
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:27,179
I'll kill you, bosco!

239
00:17:27,214 --> 00:17:30,182
I'll kill him.
I'll kill you!

240
00:17:30,217 --> 00:17:33,685
There was supposed to be-
crooks!

241
00:17:33,936 --> 00:17:37,056
I was gonna buy
a new neon sign.

242
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,562
Yeah, that's it.
Step on his face!

243
00:17:43,597 --> 00:17:46,565
That son of a bitch!

244
00:17:54,456 --> 00:17:57,459
Go get him, nicky!

245
00:17:57,576 --> 00:18:00,579
My bridesmaids' dresses
are lime green.

246
00:18:00,614 --> 00:18:04,083
And my maid of honor
is wearing lime green.

247
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:07,836
The maid of honor's dress should always
be in contrast to the bridesmaids.

248
00:18:07,871 --> 00:18:13,342
This is, um, delicious!
What do you call itchicken.

249
00:18:13,377 --> 00:18:17,346
I know it's chicken, dear, but

251
00:18:19,883 --> 00:18:21,850
Mother, i'm glad
you could come.

252
00:18:21,885 --> 00:18:24,853
I've always been sorry
you missed my wedding.

253
00:18:24,888 --> 00:18:27,856
You know i couldn't go to your
wedding. That's 'cause daddy was there.

254
00:18:27,891 --> 00:18:31,360
Where is your father tonight,
deartaking baby pictures.

255
00:18:31,395 --> 00:18:36,365
Ha! What kind of a baby is it
that's still up at 9:00 at night?

256
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:50,879
Sweetheart,
watch out for this guy.

257
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,882
He'll buy you a bottle of beer, and
then squeeze the "schlitz" outta ya.

258
00:18:53,917 --> 00:18:58,387
He's my friend.
Don't worry about him.

259
00:18:58,422 --> 00:19:02,391
Excuse me, miss. I don't mean to
interrupt while you're working.

260
00:19:02,426 --> 00:19:06,895
I was wondering if you could come
over to the house sunday for dinner...

261
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:09,398
and meet my mother?

262
00:19:09,433 --> 00:19:11,900
You gettin' tiredwanna go
homehe's kiddin' around.

263
00:19:11,935 --> 00:19:15,404
Excuse me, pal. You got a
problem herethis is my friend.

264
00:19:15,439 --> 00:19:17,906
Who are you?
Who am i?

265
00:19:17,941 --> 00:19:20,409
I'm the guy that put the bathrooms
in this joint. That's who i am.

266
00:19:20,444 --> 00:19:24,663
Now i know why the place stinks,
okay, pal?

267
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:28,167
Break it up, will ya?
What's the matter?

268
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:32,671
Take it easy, will ya?

269
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:36,925
Ma?
Hmm?

270
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:39,428
Am i pretty?

271
00:19:39,463 --> 00:19:41,930
Oh, you're beautiful,
sweetheart!

272
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:44,433
Julio's a very lucky boy.

273
00:19:44,468 --> 00:19:47,936
I wanna make him happy.

274
00:19:47,971 --> 00:19:49,938
But there's so much
i don't know.

275
00:19:49,973 --> 00:19:53,442
Like what?
Like about, you know.

276
00:19:53,477 --> 00:19:56,445
I know what?
You know!

277
00:19:57,946 --> 00:19:59,948
Oh, that!

278
00:19:59,983 --> 00:20:02,451
Didn't your father tell you
everything you need to know?

279
00:20:02,486 --> 00:20:05,954
He keeps starting,
but he never finishes.

280
00:20:05,989 --> 00:20:07,956
What do you wanna know?

281
00:20:07,991 --> 00:20:12,461
Foreplay. Have you ever heard of foreplay?

282
00:20:12,496 --> 00:20:15,964
No, not with
your father.

283
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:18,967
It's nice we can have
these little talks.

284
00:20:19,002 --> 00:20:21,470
Let's go help belinda
pour the coffee. Wait, mom.

285
00:20:21,505 --> 00:20:23,472
How did you know
you really loved daddy?

286
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:27,476
We were at coney island
on the ferris wheel.

287
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:29,978
We got caught
at the top.

288
00:20:30,013 --> 00:20:31,980
Later on,
i found out...

289
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:35,984
he paid the man a dollar
to stop the ride.

290
00:20:36,019 --> 00:20:38,487
Your father said things
to me...

291
00:20:38,522 --> 00:20:42,491
that were so sweet,
so romantic.

292
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:47,496
I said to myself,
"here's a sensitive man."

293
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:50,249
Once, a fuckin' four!

294
00:20:50,284 --> 00:20:53,252
Four!
Got a four!

295
00:20:53,287 --> 00:20:55,254
Gimme the dice, i'm hot. Gimme the dice.

296
00:20:55,289 --> 00:20:58,257
Hold it, hold it! You
won, rightright, yeah.

297
00:20:58,292 --> 00:21:02,261
We're ahead. We can leave
winners right now. Okay, so we go.

298
00:21:02,296 --> 00:21:05,264
Let's go. Double or nothin'. Here we go.

299
00:21:05,299 --> 00:21:08,267
Oh, monty!

300
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:30,789
You did it again, huh?

301
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:35,794
We were winners.
We could've walked away.

302
00:21:35,829 --> 00:21:39,298
That's how i am. Once i
get goin', i can't stop.

303
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:52,311
Come on. Forget about it.
It's history. Let's go.

304
00:21:57,816 --> 00:22:01,320
Good stuff. It oughta
be. I got it off a cop.

305
00:22:01,355 --> 00:22:06,325
I'm starvin'. Let's go to
lucky's. He's open late.

306
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:24,343
He's closed. Come on, pop's
inside. He'll let us in.

307
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:39,858
Pop's last dish.

308
00:22:39,893 --> 00:22:43,362
We're drivin' a half hour. The closest
we came to food, we almost hit a deer.

309
00:22:43,397 --> 00:22:45,364
Here's a place.

310
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:01,880
I'm so hungry,
i could eat a waitress.

311
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:20,399
No, no! No! It's wrong.
Nicky, it's wrong. I wanna see-

312
00:23:20,434 --> 00:23:22,401
it's wrong!

313
00:23:22,436 --> 00:23:26,905
It's wedding cake flavor.
I love wedding cake.

314
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:29,408
Why don't you get married?

315
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:34,913
Let me just lick the bride.

316
00:23:34,948 --> 00:23:36,915
That's my daughter!

317
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:41,920
It's a little plastic thing.
It's not your daughter.

318
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:46,925
Only one little flower each.

319
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,928
There's a lot of flowers.
Nobody will know the difference.

320
00:23:49,963 --> 00:23:52,431
Forget about it.
Let's get outta here.

321
00:23:52,466 --> 00:23:54,933
And don't drive fast.
You're drunk.

322
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:57,936
Don't worry about it. I
drive better when i'm drunk.

323
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:05,444
You got a weird sense of humor.
You know that?

324
00:24:05,479 --> 00:24:09,448
You laugh at everything.
Weather reports, car chase.

325
00:24:09,483 --> 00:24:11,950
Keep it straight. You're
swerving all over the place.

326
00:24:11,985 --> 00:24:14,453
I'm goin' straight. I'm on
the yellow line, i told ya.

327
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:19,458
Move over to one side. You're
on the other side! Get over here!

328
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:21,710
Keep to the right! Get
your hands off the wheel!

329
00:24:21,745 --> 00:24:25,096
Look out!

330
00:24:28,099 --> 00:24:32,103
My head!
I hit my head!

331
00:24:32,138 --> 00:24:35,106
What's so funnyeverything's
funny to you. You laugh and laugh.

332
00:24:35,141 --> 00:24:37,609
Watch the road, will ya?
Will you watch the road?

333
00:24:37,644 --> 00:24:42,614
I lost my joint.
Where's my joint?

334
00:24:42,649 --> 00:24:47,118
Just watch the road.

335
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:13,762
You got some aspirin?

336
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:33,281
Oh, no!

337
00:25:35,283 --> 00:25:37,786
I'm sorry.
It was an emergency.

338
00:26:05,447 --> 00:26:08,950
Are you sure this is a good ideadaddy.

339
00:26:08,985 --> 00:26:11,453
Isn't she beautiful?

340
00:26:11,488 --> 00:26:14,456
Yeah, but who's that
with her?

341
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:20,328
What do you see
in this guy?

342
00:26:20,363 --> 00:26:24,833
He has everything i ever wanted.
You don't ask for much, do ya?

343
00:26:24,868 --> 00:26:28,336
Did your mother tell you
everything you need to know?

344
00:26:28,371 --> 00:26:30,839
She taught me how to fry
bananas. Oh, beautiful.

345
00:26:30,874 --> 00:26:34,342
You'll end up working
in a spanish restaurant.

346
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:45,103
You're not pregnant,
are you?

347
00:26:45,138 --> 00:26:48,106
Daddy!
The way you brought me up?

348
00:26:48,141 --> 00:26:50,609

Why can't you make everybody happy

371

Look at him.

376
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:46,785

Hold it, hold it.
Let him talk.

384
00:31:28,269 --> 00:31:31,272
I got nothin' to say.

I'm no sinatra,
but here it goes. Okay?

387
00:31:45,787 --> 00:31:49,791
Some think the world was made
for fun and frolic?

388
00:31:50,291 --> 00:31:53,294
And so do i
and so do i?

389
00:31:53,795 --> 00:31:57,799
Some think it's right to be
so melancholic?

390
00:31:58,299 --> 00:32:01,302
They'll pine and sigh
they'll pine and sigh?

391
00:32:01,803 --> 00:32:05,924
But i i like to spend my time a-singing?

392
00:32:05,959 --> 00:32:09,427
Some joyous song
some joyous song?

393
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:13,932
To set the air
with music ever ringing?

394
00:32:13,967 --> 00:32:17,936
Is far from wrong
is far from wrong?

395
00:32:17,971 --> 00:32:21,439
Hark it, hark it
music from afar?

396
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:24,442
Hark it, hark it
with a happy heart?

397
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:29,447
Funiculi, funicula

398
00:32:29,482 --> 00:32:32,450
Joy is everywhere
funiculi, funicula?

00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:39,457
Hark it, hark it

401
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:44,963
Funiculi, funicula

00:32:52,005 --> 00:32:54,973
Hark it, hark it

405
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:59,978
Funiculi, funicula

406
00:33:00,013 --> 00:33:06,985

407
00:34:05,078 --> 00:34:07,545
How do i look?

408
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:12,550
You look beautiful.

409
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:39,077
I always dreamed
about my wedding day.

410
00:34:39,112 --> 00:34:41,579
I guess i never thought
about the night.

411
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:08,106
Be gentle with me.

412
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:20,618
Julio!

413
00:35:20,653 --> 00:35:23,121
This is foreplay.

414
00:35:23,156 --> 00:35:27,625
I have a headache. I don't
wanna touch your head.

415
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:30,628
Please, julio, i've never
been with a man before.

416
00:35:30,663 --> 00:35:32,630
Neither have i!

417
00:35:32,665 --> 00:35:35,133
Julio!

418
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:43,141
What's wrong with you?
I don't know what to do.

419
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:47,645
I brought a book.
A book?

420
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:55,153
El joyo de sexo.

421
00:35:55,188 --> 00:35:58,156
It's in spanish. I'm
gonna translate it for you.

422
00:35:58,191 --> 00:36:01,659
It has a very happy ending.
You're gonna love it.

423
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:13,171
Allison?

424
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:16,674
What do you want from me,
julio?

425
00:36:16,709 --> 00:36:20,678
I never seen anything
like that.

426
00:36:20,713 --> 00:36:23,181
Try to understand.

427
00:36:23,216 --> 00:36:26,184
I keep hearing
my father say, "don't."

428
00:36:26,219 --> 00:36:29,687
He meant before
you were married.

429
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:36,694
I'm not so sure.
You don't know my father.

430
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:42,200
Allison,

431
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:46,704
listen to me.

432
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:53,211
My cousin
once knew a guy,

433
00:36:53,246 --> 00:36:57,215
and the guy went out
with a virgin...

434
00:36:57,250 --> 00:37:00,718
for six months.

435
00:37:00,753 --> 00:37:05,723
And on their wedding night,
when they got married,

436
00:37:05,758 --> 00:37:10,228
and they wanted
to consummate the marriage,

437
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:13,731
the woman wouldn't let him.

438
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:18,736
And in the morning,

439
00:37:18,771 --> 00:37:21,739
they found
the guy dead...

440
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:25,743
in the bed
next to her.

441
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:33,251
Oh.
Allison?

442
00:37:33,286 --> 00:37:36,754
I don't wanna die.

443
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:43,261
You're my wife.
Yeah.

444
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:46,764
I love you.
Yeah.

445
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:50,768
We're all alone.

446
00:37:50,803 --> 00:37:53,271
And your father,

447
00:37:53,306 --> 00:37:55,773
he is a
million miles away.

448
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,782
Hello?

449
00:38:04,817 --> 00:38:10,288
Julio, i just wanna say
good night to my little baby.

450
00:38:10,323 --> 00:38:12,290
My father!

451
00:38:16,329 --> 00:38:20,298
You hung up on my fatheri
wouldn't hang up on your father.

452
00:38:20,333 --> 00:38:22,300
You wouldn't understand
my father.

453
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:26,304
Yeahwell, i'm not so sure
i understand you either.

454
00:38:26,339 --> 00:38:30,308
Then why don't you go spend your
wedding night with your father?

455
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:35,813
Okay... i will!

456
00:38:45,456 --> 00:38:49,960
Monty, don't forget to fix the walk. Yeah.

457
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:07,845
Watch it, watch it!
Watch where you're goin'!

458
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:12,350
My air mail!

459
00:39:12,385 --> 00:39:14,352
Oh, my air mail!

460
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:28,115
Listen to me.
I want my wife back.

461
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:30,868
Look who's here.
Don juan.

462
00:39:30,903 --> 00:39:34,372
It's your fault she left
me. What, am i responsible?

463
00:39:34,407 --> 00:39:38,376
When eddie fisher broke up with debbie,
you blame meshe don't wanna see ya.

464
00:39:38,411 --> 00:39:43,381
You gotta help me, man. Give her time.
She'll come back when she's ready.

465
00:39:43,514 --> 00:39:47,017
You oughta give her
a few drinks.

466
00:39:47,052 --> 00:39:49,637
That's how
i got her mother ready.

467
00:39:56,894 --> 00:39:58,396
I'm in.

468
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:01,899
It's up to you, paddy.
Yeah.

469
00:40:01,934 --> 00:40:06,404
What the hell is that you got
onthis used to be a shirt.

470
00:40:06,439 --> 00:40:09,907
You know rose. She don't throw nothin'
out. She keeps lookin' at the cuffs.

471
00:40:09,942 --> 00:40:12,410
Soon as they get frayed, it
becomes a short-sleeve shirt.

472
00:40:12,445 --> 00:40:14,912
When the collar goes,
i end up with a pajama top.

473
00:40:14,947 --> 00:40:17,915
Right now i got
23 short-sleeve pajama tops.

474
00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:21,419
You know what i found in the
closeta hundred 1978 calendars.

475
00:40:21,454 --> 00:40:23,421
That's rose!

476
00:40:23,456 --> 00:40:28,426
If 1978 ever comes back, we're in great
shape. We gonna talk or play cards?

477
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:33,180
He'll talk.

478
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:39,937
Nicky, take it easy.

479
00:40:39,972 --> 00:40:42,940
Take it easy.
He didn't mean it.

480
00:40:45,978 --> 00:40:49,447
Monty, the phone.

481
00:40:49,482 --> 00:40:51,449
Hellohello?

482
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:54,952
Monty,
you have to pick it up.

483
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:06,464
You got the wrong number.
There's nobody home. We're asleep.

484
00:41:06,499 --> 00:41:08,966
Mr. Capuletti?

485
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:13,971
Are you there?
Monty, who is it?

486
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:26,233
Hellohello!
Anyone there?

487
00:41:26,268 --> 00:41:28,736
Ah, ah.

488
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:34,241
Who know a scrappleton?

489
00:41:34,276 --> 00:41:37,244
That's mother's lawyer.

490
00:41:42,249 --> 00:41:45,252
Yeah. Yeah?

491
00:41:45,287 --> 00:41:48,255
That's awful!

492
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:52,760
No, no. I'm sorry. I'll tell her.

493
00:41:52,795 --> 00:41:54,762
I'll tell her.
I'm sorry.

494
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:58,766
Monty, what happened?

495
00:42:00,267 --> 00:42:05,272
Rose, you better sit down
for this.

496
00:42:09,276 --> 00:42:12,780
Is it... mother?

497
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:17,284
Rose, there was
a plane crash.

498
00:42:17,319 --> 00:42:21,288
Your mother...
earned her wings.

499
00:42:22,289 --> 00:42:26,794
It's all right.
It's all right, baby.

500
00:42:26,927 --> 00:42:29,930
"And to my nephew clive,

501
00:42:29,965 --> 00:42:32,433
"son of my beloved
departed brother,

502
00:42:32,468 --> 00:42:35,936
"whom i've undertaken
to raise as a son of my own,

503
00:42:35,971 --> 00:42:39,940
"inasmuch as he has always
led a simple, virtuous life,

504
00:42:39,975 --> 00:42:43,444
"and because it is my wish
that he continue to do so,

505
00:42:43,479 --> 00:42:48,449
"i bequeath to him an additional
income of $5,000 a year...

506
00:42:48,484 --> 00:42:50,451
for the rest of his life."

507
00:42:50,951 --> 00:42:53,954
Ah... there must be
some mistake.

508
00:42:54,455 --> 00:42:57,958
There must be some more zeroes. No.

509
00:42:57,993 --> 00:42:59,960
Um, a comma?

510
00:42:59,995 --> 00:43:01,962
No.

511
00:43:02,463 --> 00:43:04,465
"To my beloved daughter, rose,

512
00:43:04,715 --> 00:43:08,719
"burdened as she is with cares
and responsibilities,

513
00:43:08,754 --> 00:43:11,722
"i bequeath the remainder
of my estate,

514
00:43:12,222 --> 00:43:14,224
"which includes
monahan's department store,

515
00:43:14,725 --> 00:43:17,227
estimated worth,
$10 million."

516
00:43:17,262 --> 00:43:19,229
Oh!

517
00:43:19,264 --> 00:43:22,232
"If, and only if,
her husband monty...

518
00:43:22,267 --> 00:43:24,234
can reform himself
in one year."

519
00:43:24,269 --> 00:43:26,236
What kind of reform?

520
00:43:26,271 --> 00:43:30,741
There is a codicil attached
to the will, mr. "capalooti."

521
00:43:30,776 --> 00:43:33,243
That's capuletti.
Mr. Capuletti.

522
00:43:33,744 --> 00:43:37,748
Which lists the activities
which are to be proscribed:

523
00:43:37,783 --> 00:43:42,753
That is, the things
you must refrain from.

524
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:52,763
No smoking.
No philandering.

525
00:43:52,798 --> 00:43:55,766
No gambling. No drugs. No alcohol.

526
00:43:56,266 --> 00:44:00,270
No alcoholdoes that go
for beer toocertainly.

527
00:44:00,305 --> 00:44:05,275
And you must weigh not more
than 175 pounds. Question.

528
00:44:05,310 --> 00:44:09,780
Assuming monty can't reform-
perish the thought.

529
00:44:09,815 --> 00:44:12,783
Oh, then you get the money.

530
00:44:12,818 --> 00:44:14,785
I do?

531
00:44:26,296 --> 00:44:30,300
- Forget about it. I'm not doin' it.
- You're right, forget it.

532
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:35,305
Daddy, you can do it!
It's $10 million!

533
00:44:36,306 --> 00:44:38,809
Oh, and mr. "capalooti,"

534
00:44:38,844 --> 00:44:41,812
should you decide to accept
these terms,

535
00:44:41,847 --> 00:44:45,315
remember...
we'll be watching you.

536
00:44:47,317 --> 00:44:51,822
I need a drink and a cigarette
so i can think this over.

537
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:56,193
Twelve months?
Forget about it.

538
00:44:56,228 --> 00:45:00,197
You can do that standing on
your head. It's easy money.

539
00:45:00,447 --> 00:45:02,449
Hey, that's a lot of money.

540
00:45:02,484 --> 00:45:04,952
That could parlay
into a fortune for you.

541
00:45:04,987 --> 00:45:09,456
I couldn't care less, monty,
but think of the kids.

542
00:45:09,957 --> 00:45:13,460
- Think about mommy.
- Think of your wife, and your kids.

543
00:45:16,964 --> 00:45:19,466
Think of me, ya bum!

544
00:46:07,147 --> 00:46:09,650
Monty, breakfast is ready.

545
00:46:11,151 --> 00:46:13,153
Oh, breakfast.
Beautiful.

546
00:46:13,188 --> 00:46:15,656
I stopped smoking.
I'm starvin'.

547
00:46:15,691 --> 00:46:17,658
Dad, pass the syrup.
Here, here.

548
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:24,164
You gave me the wrong plate. Where's
the rest of my eggs and my home fries?

549
00:46:24,665 --> 00:46:28,669
These are the rest of your
eggs, these are your home fries,

550
00:46:28,704 --> 00:46:31,672
and this is applesauce.

551
00:46:36,176 --> 00:46:40,180
Belinda, i can't eat all my
home fries. Want some home fries?

552
00:46:40,215 --> 00:46:42,182
No, thanks.

553
00:46:42,217 --> 00:46:45,185
Here, monty.
Oohhh, pass them to belinda.

554
00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:48,689
If you wanna lose weight,
you should start now.

555
00:46:51,692 --> 00:46:53,694
Ooh, food.

556
00:46:53,729 --> 00:46:56,697
It's a tough give-up.
Allison, eat.

557
00:46:56,732 --> 00:46:59,700
Allison, you gotta eat.

558
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:01,702
I know marriage is rough.

559
00:47:02,202 --> 00:47:05,205
It's not all moonlight and
canoes. That's in the movies.

560
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:08,208
I don't wanna talk about it.
What's the matter with you?

561
00:47:08,243 --> 00:47:11,712
You don't eat.
You don't talk to no one.

562
00:47:12,212 --> 00:47:14,715
You lock yourself
in your room all night.

563
00:47:14,750 --> 00:47:16,717
The way you're carrying on,
you'll never meet another guy.

564
00:47:23,974 --> 00:47:26,476
What'd i say?

565
00:47:26,511 --> 00:47:28,478
"You'll never meet
another guy."

566
00:47:28,513 --> 00:47:30,981
Take out the garbage.

567
00:47:31,231 --> 00:47:34,234
Take out the garbage.

568
00:47:34,269 --> 00:47:38,238
I didn't even eat,
i gotta take out the garbage.

569
00:47:40,741 --> 00:47:42,743
Hi.

570
00:47:54,755 --> 00:47:57,257
She ain't worth
$10 million.

571
00:48:01,378 --> 00:48:03,380
$5 million, maybe.

572
00:49:00,070 --> 00:49:02,572
Hey, not here!
Not here!

573
00:49:02,607 --> 00:49:06,076
I'm your new neighbor, bill
jones. Call me bill. Not here!

574
00:49:06,576 --> 00:49:10,580
- Take him on your property.
- You interrupt king's business, he gets very upset.

575
00:49:11,081 --> 00:49:13,583
What makes you think
i wanna inherit his business?

576
00:49:13,618 --> 00:49:15,585
If you feel so bad,
i'll clean it up.

577
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:19,589
So you're monty capuletti!
Congratulations on your daughter's wedding.

580
00:49:27,632 --> 00:49:30,600
I wanna have a relationship. Most important
thing for us, we gotta have a good rapport.

581
00:49:31,101 --> 00:49:33,103
Wait till you meet ginger.
She's my better half.

582
00:49:33,138 --> 00:49:36,606
I already saw your better half.
In fact, i saw more than half.

583
00:49:36,641 --> 00:49:39,609
She's a dynamite girl. I met her
in vegas a couple of years ago.

584
00:49:39,644 --> 00:49:44,114
Oh, man, she's a loving, caring, sharing
person. Maybe you can become friendly.

585
00:49:44,614 --> 00:49:48,118
I need you two to move in. I'm nervous
enough this morning. Are you kiddin'?

586

Little ups, little downs, little

What are you talkin' to me about drugs
fori got my daughter here. She's 12.

589
00:49:58,663 --> 00:50:01,631
Look, you got a connection in
the family already, stick with it.

590
00:50:01,666 --> 00:50:04,634
But just this once, i'll tell you

591

593
00:50:33,268 --> 00:50:37,139
Two, four, six, eight, ten.
Two, four, six, eight, ten.

594
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:49,785
This is ridiculous.

595
00:50:49,820 --> 00:50:52,287
But jogging's
good for you.

596
00:50:52,322 --> 00:50:56,792
Thanks to jogging, more people than
ever are dropping dead in perfect health.

597
00:51:07,302 --> 00:51:10,806
Five more.

00:52:07,863 --> 00:52:09,865
Great guy you are,
you know that?

608
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:13,368
Can't wait till he blows it,
huhbettin' on it and everything.

609
00:52:13,403 --> 00:52:15,871
Listen to you. You some kind of altar boy?

610
00:52:16,121 --> 00:52:20,626
Huhyou're some influence. You gamble in
front of him, you drink in front of him.

611
00:52:20,993 --> 00:52:23,245
Monty see, monty do,
you know.

612
00:52:28,884 --> 00:52:33,388
Hector, hector.
Don't push me.

613
00:52:33,423 --> 00:52:36,391
Listen to me.
It's gonna work.

614
00:52:36,426 --> 00:52:38,393
See these pennies?

615
00:52:38,428 --> 00:52:42,898
You take these pennies, you throw 'em
at the window. I'll be in the bush.

616
00:52:42,933 --> 00:52:45,400
I saw it in a movie.
It's gonna work perfect.

617
00:52:45,435 --> 00:52:48,403
If you need help, listen to
what i'm gonna tell you to say.

618
00:52:48,904 --> 00:52:51,406
Go get 'em.

619
00:52:51,441 --> 00:52:54,910
Where you goingi'll be in the bush.

620
00:52:54,945 --> 00:52:56,912
Throw the pennies.

621
00:52:56,947 --> 00:52:59,915
You're gonna be behind the
bushi'll be right here.

622
00:53:12,427 --> 00:53:14,930
Who's there?

623
00:53:18,934 --> 00:53:21,937
Hey.
How are you?

624
00:53:23,939 --> 00:53:26,942
I was just, uh-

625
00:53:26,977 --> 00:53:28,944
i was in the neighborhood,

626
00:53:28,979 --> 00:53:32,948
and thought i'd stop by,
see what's cooking.

627
00:53:32,983 --> 00:53:36,451
That julio?
Yeah.

628
00:53:38,453 --> 00:53:41,957
What do i say?
Tell her to come down.

629
00:53:41,992 --> 00:53:45,961
Prove to her
you're the man.

630
00:53:46,461 --> 00:53:48,580
Come down.
I'm the man.

631
00:53:48,615 --> 00:53:51,967
Get tough.
Tell her you're bad.

632
00:53:52,002 --> 00:53:53,835
I'm bad.
Like you mean it.

633
00:53:53,870 --> 00:53:57,973
Allison!
I'm bad.

634
00:53:58,473 --> 00:54:00,976
No, no, no!

635
00:54:01,011 --> 00:54:03,478
Jump up and down.

636
00:54:03,513 --> 00:54:07,099
I am so bad! I am so bad! Be angry.

637
00:54:07,134 --> 00:54:10,986
Who are you talking to?
Julio... and a hedge.

638
00:54:11,021 --> 00:54:13,989
I'm so bad,
i should be in detention.

639
00:54:14,024 --> 00:54:16,491
No. Be mean.

640
00:54:16,992 --> 00:54:18,994
Wave your arms.
Make believe you're angry.

641
00:54:19,029 --> 00:54:21,496
Listen to me.

642
00:54:21,531 --> 00:54:23,999
I'm not that kind of guy...

643
00:54:24,034 --> 00:54:27,002
that's gonna start playing around
in the driveway of a tract house!

644
00:54:27,037 --> 00:54:31,006
I'm not gonna lose my temper
in front of the woman i love!

645
00:54:33,508 --> 00:54:36,511
Get on your knees.
Beg her.

646
00:54:36,546 --> 00:54:39,514
Tell her you're thinking
of killing yourself.

647
00:54:42,517 --> 00:54:46,021
No.
I don't talk like that.

648
00:54:46,521 --> 00:54:51,026
Do you hear me?
I don't talk like that.

649
00:54:51,061 --> 00:54:56,031
If you know so much about
women, you talk to her.

650
00:54:56,066 --> 00:54:58,533
The hedge,
allison capuletti.

651
00:54:58,568 --> 00:55:02,537
Allison, the hedge
has a few words to say to you.

652
00:55:02,572 --> 00:55:06,541
I don't know what to say. Oh,
now you don't know what to say!

653
00:55:06,576 --> 00:55:10,545
Allison, julio's
very unhappy.

654
00:55:10,580 --> 00:55:13,548
You made a fool out of me! Get
off of my ear! Let go of my leg!

655
00:55:20,422 --> 00:55:23,558
Saturday lunch. I can have
a piece of fruit, citrus,

656
00:55:23,593 --> 00:55:25,560
or four ounces of fish.

657
00:55:25,595 --> 00:55:27,562
I think i'll have
the fruit.

658
00:55:27,597 --> 00:55:31,066
Sometimes with the fish, these
guys go over. What'll you have?

659
00:55:31,101 --> 00:55:34,569
Two with sauerkraut and a yoo-hoo. Got it.

660
00:55:34,604 --> 00:55:39,074
Two with sauerkraut.
Yoo-hoo.

661
00:55:39,109 --> 00:55:42,577
What do you want, buddy?
Nothin'. I'll just smell his.

662
00:55:50,085 --> 00:55:54,089
You know why i'm going through this
whole thingfor my kids, that's why.

663
00:55:54,124 --> 00:55:57,092
That's the greatest love in the
world, your kids. You can't beat it.

664
00:55:57,127 --> 00:56:00,595
That's why you do things.
That's love, for your kids.

665
00:56:00,630 --> 00:56:03,098
See that man over there
with his kid?

666
00:56:03,133 --> 00:56:07,102
That's love. Look at the way he loves
the kid, bouncing him on his knee.

667
00:56:07,137 --> 00:56:11,606
That's love, baby. There he is!
Thank goodness he's all right!

668
00:56:11,641 --> 00:56:15,110
I'm sitting here minding my
business, he jumped on my lap.

669
00:56:15,610 --> 00:56:17,112
Get away from my kid!
Everybody calm down.

670
00:56:17,612 --> 00:56:19,614
Do you have some identification?
It's in my other raincoat.

671
00:56:19,649 --> 00:56:25,137
Never wander away from mommy
again. Spit that out right now!

672
00:56:31,126 --> 00:56:33,378
Come on.

673
00:56:38,133 --> 00:56:40,635
It's all ready.
Come on, give it a shot.

674
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:48,143
You gotta go
30 miles an hour...

675
00:56:48,393 --> 00:56:51,012
for 15 minutes
for it to do anything.

676
00:56:51,047 --> 00:56:55,016
Faster, faster.
Come on.

677
00:56:55,051 --> 00:56:57,152
Faster. You gotta
get it up to speed.

678
00:56:57,652 --> 00:57:00,155
Faster, faster, faster!

679
00:57:02,023 --> 00:57:04,659
Faster. 30 miles.
Faster. Faster.

680
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:11,032
Oh, my-
oh, no! Oh.

681
00:57:16,588 --> 00:57:19,174
Come on. Keep quiet.
Keep your head down.

682
00:57:19,674 --> 00:57:21,676
Is my hair too flat?
No.

683
00:57:21,711 --> 00:57:24,679
You look great.
Come on.

684
00:57:24,714 --> 00:57:28,683
Come on. Okay. Gimme that.

685
00:57:28,718 --> 00:57:32,554
It's locked. Let's go play space invaders.

686
00:57:32,804 --> 00:57:35,190
No. We'll go up
the drain pipe.

687
00:57:35,225 --> 00:57:38,193
Don't worry about it.
Everything's gonna be all right.

688
00:57:38,228 --> 00:57:41,696
All you gotta do
is climb up.

689
00:57:42,197 --> 00:57:44,199
Come on.
Come on.

690
00:57:44,234 --> 00:57:46,201
You can do it!
You bad!

691
00:57:48,703 --> 00:57:53,208
I had to hook up with the only virgin
in new york. Didn't they teach this...

692
00:57:53,243 --> 00:57:57,712
at schoolthey taught math at
your school, but you can't divide.

693
00:57:57,747 --> 00:58:00,715
At least
i can multiply.

694
00:58:01,216 --> 00:58:03,718
You sure this is
allison's bedroom?

695
00:58:03,753 --> 00:58:07,222
I know this place
like the back of my hand.

696
00:58:16,731 --> 00:58:21,736
What happenedi got the back
of my hand stuck in the toilet.

697
00:58:29,861 --> 00:58:33,365
Listen to me.
You gotta be quiet.

698
00:58:33,865 --> 00:58:36,368
We gotta be quiet.

699
00:58:38,370 --> 00:58:41,373
Where's the light?
Shh!

700
00:58:42,374 --> 00:58:44,876
That isn't a light.

701
00:58:44,911 --> 00:58:48,380
That's not the light.
And this is not the light.

702
00:58:48,415 --> 00:58:52,884
That's the water pik.

703
00:58:59,274 --> 00:59:01,776
Here's the plan.

704
00:59:01,811 --> 00:59:04,279
I'm gonna go talk
to allison.

705
00:59:04,314 --> 00:59:07,782
When i leave the room,
you-

706
00:59:10,785 --> 00:59:12,787
we're in here.

707
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:27,802
Just be calm.

708
00:59:28,303 --> 00:59:31,306
Just be calm,
and get out the window.

709
00:59:38,313 --> 00:59:40,315
Ow!

710
00:59:41,816 --> 00:59:43,818
I'll meet you down by the car. Yeah.

711
00:59:43,853 --> 00:59:47,322
I'll be all right.
Don't worry about it.

712
00:59:50,692 --> 00:59:52,327
Julio!

713
00:59:52,362 --> 00:59:54,829
Julio!

714
01:00:16,101 --> 01:00:19,104
I'll have a number three
with flour tortillas.

715
01:00:19,139 --> 01:00:21,606
Mmm.
Two of them.

716
01:00:24,609 --> 01:00:28,613
Um, i'll have the special. Number one.

717
01:00:31,616 --> 01:00:36,121
I'll have a junior salad.
No dressing.

718
01:00:39,624 --> 01:00:41,626
Why don't you stop
carryin' on?

719
01:00:41,661 --> 01:00:45,630
Rate you're goin', i'll bet you a
hundred bucks you're not gonna make it.

720
01:00:45,665 --> 01:00:50,135
If i bet you,
then i won't make it.

721
01:00:50,170 --> 01:00:54,139
When the going gets tough,
the tough get going.

722
01:00:54,174 --> 01:00:56,641
What if
you're not tough?

723
01:00:56,676 --> 01:00:58,643
You gotta be strong
like me.

724
01:00:58,678 --> 01:01:00,645
Look. What is this?
Nothin'.

725
01:01:00,680 --> 01:01:04,649
Put it right out. It's
not gonna be my master.

726
01:01:07,152 --> 01:01:09,154
Gimme a light, lou.

727
01:01:13,158 --> 01:01:17,162
Mm, monty, gotta
have "discilton."

728
01:01:17,197 --> 01:01:19,664
Discipline.

729
01:01:21,666 --> 01:01:25,670
Can i have your olive?
You got extra olives?

730
01:01:25,705 --> 01:01:28,173
You want the black one
or the green one?

731
01:01:28,208 --> 01:01:31,676
Which one you wantit's up
to you. Take the green one.

732
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:40,185
Just a minute. Okayyou
gotta stay still. Okay, kid?

733
01:01:40,220 --> 01:01:43,188
You gotta stay still.
Kid, you gotta stay still.

734
01:01:43,223 --> 01:01:45,190
Have you ever seen
a face like that before?

735
01:01:45,690 --> 01:01:47,692
No. If i did,
i'd remember it.

736
01:01:47,727 --> 01:01:51,446
Okay, i'm gonna get a real
good picture now. Okay?

737
01:01:51,481 --> 01:01:55,817
- Look at him! He's got my eyes.
- He's got my nose.

738
01:01:55,852 --> 01:01:58,820
And my sympathy.
All right.

739
01:01:58,855 --> 01:02:00,822
We want some
wallet-size pictures too.

740
01:02:01,072 --> 01:02:04,075
This kid won't fit
in a wallet-size.

741
01:02:04,110 --> 01:02:06,578
Make good pictures.
My wife's very particular.

742
01:02:06,613 --> 01:02:10,582
What about you, john?
He's very particular too.

743
01:02:10,617 --> 01:02:13,084
I'm surprised
you married each other.

744
01:02:13,119 --> 01:02:15,587
All right.
Look, kid.

745
01:02:15,622 --> 01:02:19,591
I'm tired of telling you the same thing.
You gotta stay still. I'll tell you what.

746
01:02:19,974 --> 01:02:23,978
Anthony, i'm gonna make a deal
with you. Anthony, pay attention.

747
01:02:24,013 --> 01:02:25,980
You gotta stay still.

748
01:02:26,097 --> 01:02:30,602
If we wanna get a good picture, we gotta
stay still. We wanna get a good picture.

749
01:02:31,102 --> 01:02:35,106
Stay still.
Help that kid out.

750
01:02:35,141 --> 01:02:38,109
Talk to him, grandma.
Here we go, anthony.

751
01:02:38,144 --> 01:02:41,496
Be quiet.

752
01:02:41,531 --> 01:02:44,999
Stay still.
Quiet, will ya!

753
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:49,003
Quiet! John, talk to him.
Stay quiet!

754
01:02:49,038 --> 01:02:52,507
Hey, kid,
be quiet, will ya?

755
01:02:52,542 --> 01:02:56,010
Somebody! Will you shut
the fat little bastard up?

756
01:02:56,127 --> 01:02:58,129
What is the law?

757
01:02:58,164 --> 01:03:02,133
Not to go on all fours.

758
01:03:02,168 --> 01:03:05,136
That is the law.

01:13:54,535 --> 01:13:56,537
The first thing we do
is fire that broad downstairs...

911
01:13:56,572 --> 01:13:59,039
that stopped us
from browsing.

912
01:13:59,540 --> 01:14:03,043
Get me sergio. Track down alfonso.
Draw up a budget for mr. Capuletti.

913
01:14:03,078 --> 01:14:05,546
Let's leak the story
to the press.

914
01:14:13,088 --> 01:14:16,056
Hello.

915
01:14:16,091 --> 01:14:19,560
Mr. Capuletti, please.
It's for you. It's your wife.

916
01:14:21,562 --> 01:14:23,564
Rose, they took
all my clothes!

917
01:14:24,064 --> 01:14:26,066
When are you
coming home?

918
01:14:26,101 --> 01:14:28,819
How can i come home?
I got nothing to wear.

919
01:14:28,854 --> 01:14:30,821
I'll call you later.
Take this.

920
01:14:30,856 --> 01:14:33,324
Turn away, please.
Next shirt.

921
01:14:33,359 --> 01:14:35,326
Take it easy, honey.
I got no good side.

922
01:14:35,361 --> 01:14:37,828
Could you please
turn away?

923
01:14:38,329 --> 01:14:41,332
Scrape the gum off the soles
and analyze the shoes.

924
01:14:41,367 --> 01:14:44,835
Should these shorts be duplicated?
Duplicated and fumigated.

925
01:14:44,870 --> 01:14:47,338
Next. I have the blacks for the shirts.

926
01:14:47,373 --> 01:14:49,840
That's mr. Capuletti's
department now.

927
01:14:51,842 --> 01:14:55,346
I have midnight black,
raven black, licorice black-

928
01:14:55,381 --> 01:14:57,348
if nicky was here, you'd
have black-and-blue black.

929
01:14:57,731 --> 01:14:59,733
Twelve inches.

930
01:14:59,768 --> 01:15:02,486
Boy, you're way off.

931
01:15:09,994 --> 01:15:13,497
Ladies and gentlemen.
Compliments of monty capuletti,

932
01:15:13,532 --> 01:15:17,001
invitations to the premiere of
monahan's "the regular guy look."

933
01:15:17,036 --> 01:15:19,003
Barkeeper, i'll have
a perrier with a twist.

934
01:15:19,038 --> 01:15:22,006
I'm sorry. I only have
perrier on draft.

935
01:15:22,041 --> 01:15:24,008
Nicholas, patrick,
how good to see you again.

936
01:15:24,508 --> 01:15:27,511
I know what you're thinking.
Why am i slumming?

937
01:15:27,546 --> 01:15:31,515
I'm here to hand-deliver
these invitations to you.

938
01:15:31,550 --> 01:15:35,019
But i'm not sure
if you should attend.

939
01:15:35,054 --> 01:15:37,021
We're his friends.
We'll be there. Gimme.

940
01:15:37,521 --> 01:15:42,026
It's your decision. I'm sure your
intentions are the best, but think about it.

941
01:15:42,526 --> 01:15:47,531
It's not good for monty to associate
with people who do what heusedto do.

942
01:15:47,566 --> 01:15:51,035
We would protect him from
that. He's talking about us.

943
01:15:51,070 --> 01:15:54,038
If you really are monty's friends,
you'll stop making it hard for him.

944
01:15:54,073 --> 01:15:56,540
Look at you.
You're smoking, drinking.

945
01:15:56,575 --> 01:15:59,043
We're in a bar. What
do you expect us to do?

946
01:15:59,078 --> 01:16:01,045
You must think
i'm stupid or something.

947
01:16:01,080 --> 01:16:03,547
I look like
i just got off a boat?

948
01:16:03,582 --> 01:16:07,051
I know what you're trying to do. Get
out of here before i give you a slap.

949
01:16:07,086 --> 01:16:09,553
Nicky, take it easy.

950
01:16:09,588 --> 01:16:14,558
Nick, you do want monty to
have the money, don't you?

951
01:16:19,063 --> 01:16:23,567
What do you let it get to you
forhe just wants the money.

952
01:16:23,602 --> 01:16:28,072
But what bothers me is
he's right. So he's right.

953
01:16:28,107 --> 01:16:30,574
Think he's right?
I mean, nicky's his coach.

954
01:16:30,609 --> 01:16:34,078
He tells him eat fruit,
tells him to exercise.

955
01:16:34,113 --> 01:16:39,083
It's not what he says, it's
what we do. It's peer pressure.

956
01:16:39,118 --> 01:16:42,086
Oh, yeah.
Our lives are attractive.

957
01:16:54,965 --> 01:16:58,469
I guess nicky and paddy
won't show.

958
01:16:58,504 --> 01:17:01,472
They didn't call,
either, huh?

959
01:17:01,507 --> 01:17:03,474
No.
Tonight, we present...

960
01:17:03,974 --> 01:17:06,477
our tribute to
the american silhouette.

961
01:17:06,512 --> 01:17:09,480
Ladies and gentlemen,
"the regular guy look."

962
01:17:14,520 --> 01:17:18,489
Jonathan and billy are wearing the
regular guy leisure look for fall.

963
01:17:18,524 --> 01:17:21,492
Bold print, double-knit
polyester pants...

964
01:17:21,527 --> 01:17:24,995
with totally non-coordinated
print shirts.

965
01:17:27,498 --> 01:17:30,000
Pie is wearing
the italian restaurant look.

966
01:17:32,538 --> 01:17:35,005
Perfect for picnics where you
can be your own tablecloth.

967
01:17:35,040 --> 01:17:39,009
Tie has the bowling alley
sportif look.

968
01:17:39,044 --> 01:17:42,012
Next up, peter,
wearing...

969
01:17:42,047 --> 01:17:45,516
the regular guy
lounge look in black...

970
01:17:45,551 --> 01:17:48,519
on black, on black.

971
01:17:49,019 --> 01:17:53,023
I think they like it.
Everyone's smiling.

972
01:17:56,061 --> 01:18:01,031
You like to gambletake a
chance on the regular guy robe.

973
01:18:07,037 --> 01:18:10,040
American classic...

974
01:18:10,075 --> 01:18:12,543
iridescent blue
sharkskin.

975
01:18:18,048 --> 01:18:20,551
That suit.
Look at that suit.

976
01:18:20,586 --> 01:18:22,553
Have you seen
the suit-

977
01:18:24,555 --> 01:18:26,557
and now...

978
01:18:26,592 --> 01:18:30,561
i'd like to introduce the man
responsible for this evening.

979
01:18:31,061 --> 01:18:34,064
Mr. Monty capuletti!

980
01:18:34,099 --> 01:18:36,066
Take a bow, monty.

981
01:18:58,088 --> 01:19:00,591
Fatty. Eating again,
fatty, fatty?

982
01:19:00,626 --> 01:19:03,594
Fatty, fatty.
Eating again, fatty, fatty?

983
01:19:03,629 --> 01:19:07,097
Fatty, fatty, fatty-

984
01:19:07,132 --> 01:19:09,600
who put this in here?
I was trying to help.

985
01:19:09,635 --> 01:19:12,603
Don't help. I'm tired of
people trying to help me.

986
01:19:15,105 --> 01:19:18,609
Monty, calm down.
What are you lookin' at?

987
01:19:18,644 --> 01:19:20,611
Go clean your room.
It's a pigsty.

988
01:19:20,646 --> 01:19:23,113
Leave me alone!

989
01:19:23,148 --> 01:19:27,117
I know what you're thinkin' too. Oh, god.

990
01:19:27,152 --> 01:19:29,119
All i ever wanted
was a happy family.

991
01:19:29,620 --> 01:19:32,122
That's all i ever asked for,
a happy family.

992
01:19:32,157 --> 01:19:36,126
A family that loved each other.
I never cared about anything else.

993
01:19:37,628 --> 01:19:41,131
Stop it.
I can't take it no more.

994
01:19:41,632 --> 01:19:45,135
Money caused all this.

995
01:19:45,170 --> 01:19:49,139
I don't wanna be rich.
We're not supposed to be rich.

996
01:19:49,174 --> 01:19:52,142
We don't look rich, we don't
talk rich, we don't smell rich!

997
01:19:52,643 --> 01:19:56,146
No more rich! I want our
house to be the way it was.

998
01:20:02,152 --> 01:20:05,155
Hey, fatty, fatty.

999
01:20:05,656 --> 01:20:10,160
Monty, where are you goingi'll
be at louie's... gettin' drunk.

1000
01:20:10,410 --> 01:20:12,412
Take this, julio.
Go and get her.

1001
01:20:12,447 --> 01:20:15,916
She's your wife. Go get
her. Right, she's my wife.

1002
01:20:15,951 --> 01:20:17,918
A gun.
I don't want a gun.

1003
01:20:17,953 --> 01:20:20,420
Go back and get her,
julio.

1004
01:20:20,921 --> 01:20:23,423
I must've been nuts
to do this for-

1005
01:20:23,458 --> 01:20:25,425
ah, look who's here.

1006
01:20:25,460 --> 01:20:27,928
I want her back, man.
She's mine.

1007
01:20:28,312 --> 01:20:30,314
Put that thing away.
You'll hurt yourself.

1008
01:20:30,349 --> 01:20:34,318
I'm in no mood for you.
There is no mood for you.

1009
01:20:42,861 --> 01:20:45,829
Nurse!
Where is she?

1010
01:20:45,864 --> 01:20:48,332
They're never here
when you need 'em.

1011
01:20:51,835 --> 01:20:54,338
Boy, oh, boy.

1012
01:20:54,373 --> 01:20:58,342
Oh, nurse, you're here.
Where were you, huh?

1013
01:20:58,377 --> 01:21:00,844
Three hundred and fifty bucks
a day, where are ya?

1014
01:21:01,345 --> 01:21:02,846
Where are ya?

1015
01:21:03,347 --> 01:21:06,850
Look at this.
I'm dying of thirst here.

1016
01:21:06,885 --> 01:21:09,853
Hey, how ya doin'i heard
about your unfortunate incident.

1017
01:21:09,888 --> 01:21:12,356
Where were you
when i needed you?

1018
01:21:12,391 --> 01:21:14,358
I came to make up.
I'm sorry.

1019
01:21:14,393 --> 01:21:18,362
All right, nicky, we're friends.
All right?

1020
01:21:18,862 --> 01:21:20,864
It must be tough
eatin', huh?

1021
01:21:21,365 --> 01:21:24,868
Eatyou should see me go to the bathroom.

1022
01:21:24,903 --> 01:21:29,373
Monty! Hi, nicky. We're
back. Rose, you're here.

1023
01:21:29,408 --> 01:21:34,378
How's our patient today?
Oh, he looks much better.

1024
01:21:34,413 --> 01:21:37,881
How did you sleepare you
kiddin'i was up all night.

1025
01:21:37,916 --> 01:21:40,884
Let's look at the chart.

1026
01:21:40,919 --> 01:21:44,388
He was hit in the fleshy
area of the gluteus maximus.

1027
01:21:44,423 --> 01:21:46,890
Ah, you're wrong.
He got me in the ass.

1028
01:21:46,925 --> 01:21:49,893
No vital areas
were damaged.

1029
01:21:49,928 --> 01:21:52,896
No doubt he'll recover. How
long do i have to be here?

1030
01:21:52,931 --> 01:21:56,900
Let me see now. Perhaps we
might have to keep you here...

1031
01:21:57,401 --> 01:22:00,404
for four,
maybe five weeks.

1032
01:22:00,904 --> 01:22:02,906
I'm not hangin' here
for five weeks.

1033
01:22:02,941 --> 01:22:04,908
At least i know you're
gonna be all right.

1034
01:22:04,943 --> 01:22:07,911
I gotta pick up my mother at the
beauty parlor. So long, nicky.

1035
01:22:12,951 --> 01:22:16,420
How are you feeling today?
You're looking good.

1036
01:22:18,422 --> 01:22:22,426
Oh, daddy!

1037
01:22:22,926 --> 01:22:26,930
I never realized how much
julio loved me.

1038
01:22:26,965 --> 01:22:30,934
It was the most
romantic moment of my life...

1039
01:22:30,969 --> 01:22:34,554
when he almost killed you.

1040
01:22:34,589 --> 01:22:36,556
Can i call you "dad" now?

1041
01:22:37,024 --> 01:22:39,126
Take it easy!

1042
01:22:39,161 --> 01:22:41,628
These are new stitches,
you know.

1043
01:22:42,129 --> 01:22:44,131
Why can't you forgive
and forget?

1044
01:22:44,264 --> 01:22:47,267
How could i forgetevery time
i sit down, i'll think of him.

1045
01:22:47,768 --> 01:22:49,770
Monty, how are you?

1046
01:22:50,270 --> 01:22:53,273
What an insensitive question.
You've been shot.

1047
01:22:53,308 --> 01:22:56,143
This'll cheer you up.
We're a hit.

1048
01:22:56,178 --> 01:22:58,645
What are you talking about?
They all laughed at me.

1049
01:22:58,680 --> 01:23:01,648
But we're laughing now,
all the way to my bank.

1050
01:23:01,683 --> 01:23:03,650
Look at this.
What?

1051
01:23:05,652 --> 01:23:08,655
We put the clothes in the window,
and the kids went crazy for it.

1052
01:23:08,690 --> 01:23:12,159
I don't understand it,
but who cares?

1053
01:23:12,194 --> 01:23:14,661
The regular guy look
is a big success.

1054
01:23:14,696 --> 01:23:19,166
You did the regular guy looki just
bought two of your short-sleeve pajama tops.

1055
01:23:19,201 --> 01:23:23,170
Rose, i gotta get out of
here. Daddy, this is great!

1056
01:23:23,205 --> 01:23:26,673
By the time you get out of the
hospital, we'll have the money.

1057
01:23:26,708 --> 01:23:28,675
And you'll lose weight too.

1058
01:23:28,710 --> 01:23:32,679
I saw the food. Monty, she's

Allison, you're married
to julio.

1109
01:27:01,923 --> 01:27:06,393
This is the life, huhand they
say money can't buy happiness.

1110
01:27:06,428 --> 01:27:08,895
At least you can pick
your own kind of misery.

1111
01:27:10,897 --> 01:27:15,402
Clive, you're the only one who hasn't
seen my stitches. Want to take a look?

1112
01:27:24,411 --> 01:27:27,914

Mr. Daniel scrappleton,
sir.

01:27:37,709 --> 01:27:40,677
Hey, scrappy, show me
that dotted line, huh?

01:27:43,214 --> 01:27:46,182
Oh, no!

1119
01:27:48,219 --> 01:27:52,689
My god! It's mother. She's back from
the dead. She's better than houdini.

1120
01:27:53,189 --> 01:27:55,692
I've never felt better
in my life!

1121
01:27:55,727 --> 01:27:59,195
Grandma, did you bring me
anythinga hat just like mine.

1122
01:27:59,230 --> 01:28:02,198
You never felt better?
You were in a plane crash.

1123
01:28:02,699 --> 01:28:05,702
There was no crash. I
made up the whole thing.

1124
01:28:05,737 --> 01:28:09,706
Whyrose, i did it for
you and the grandchildren.

1125
01:28:09,741 --> 01:28:12,709
Someone had to stop
monty's debauchery.

1126
01:28:13,209 --> 01:28:16,212
He was going to hell in a
hand basket. Yes, quite true.

1127
01:28:16,247 --> 01:28:18,214
And to test you as well. You failed!

1128
01:28:18,249 --> 01:28:21,217
I'll kill her. I'll kill her! Take it easy.

1129
01:28:21,252 --> 01:28:23,219
I'll kill her!
I'll kill her!

1130
01:28:23,720 --> 01:28:25,221
I'll kill her!
Let me go!

1131
01:28:25,605 --> 01:28:29,109
Boy, you got some nerve
still being alive.

1132
01:28:29,144 --> 01:28:31,611
I went through
this whole thing for nothin'?

1133
01:28:31,646 --> 01:28:36,616
No, not for nothing, monty.
You proved yourself to me.

1134
01:28:38,618 --> 01:28:42,122
And to make sure that you
stay on the straight and narrow,

1135
01:28:42,157 --> 01:28:45,625
i'm moving in with you.

1136
01:29:03,143 --> 01:29:06,146
What's for dessert?
Spumoni, miss.

1137
01:29:06,181 --> 01:29:08,648
Your favorite, monty.

1138
01:29:08,683 --> 01:29:12,152
Shrimpton,
none for mr. Capuletti.

1139
01:29:12,187 --> 01:29:14,654
Right, mom.
And shrimpton.

1140
01:29:14,689 --> 01:29:17,157
Mr. Capuletti is skipping
the coffee too.

1141
01:29:17,192 --> 01:29:20,660
It'll keep me awake,
right, momright, dear.

1142
01:29:21,161 --> 01:29:25,665
And shrimpton, i noticed a bottle
of beer in the refrigerator.

1143
01:29:25,700 --> 01:29:30,670
Get rid of it. Tsk, tsk,
tsk. Right again, mom.

1144
01:29:32,172 --> 01:29:35,175
Well, i guess that's it
for me.

1145
01:29:35,210 --> 01:29:39,179
I think i'll go out and walk
off all these vegetables.

1146
01:29:39,679 --> 01:29:44,184
And after that...
it's bedtime.

1147
01:29:45,185 --> 01:29:48,188
Good night, honey.
Good night, sweetheart.

1148
01:29:49,189 --> 01:29:51,691
And shrimpton?
Yes, sir.

1149
01:29:51,726 --> 01:29:54,694
You better get rid of that
glazed fruit too. It's fattening.

1150
01:29:54,729 --> 01:29:57,197
Certainly, sir.

1151
01:29:57,232 --> 01:30:01,201
Good night, belinda.
Good night, daddy.

1152
01:30:01,236 --> 01:30:03,620
Ooh.
Good night, mom.

1153
01:30:06,222 --> 01:30:10,727
Hey, mom. That perfume is driving me crazy.

1154
01:30:12,729 --> 01:30:15,732
I think i married rose
to get to you, huh?

1155
01:30:22,238 --> 01:30:24,240
Good night, all.

1156
01:30:26,242 --> 01:30:30,246
Rose,
he's a changed man.

1157
01:30:30,281 --> 01:30:34,751
- Finally, you've got a good marriage.
- We had a good marriage before.

1158
01:30:35,251 --> 01:30:39,756
Yes, but now you're married
to a human being.

1159
01:30:39,791 --> 01:30:44,260
I don't mind telling you,
i'm proud of what i did.

1160
01:30:44,295 --> 01:30:46,262
It wasn't easy,

1161
01:30:46,297 --> 01:30:50,266
but now i've got him
under control!

1162
01:30:50,767 --> 01:30:52,268
Where's the pizza?
I'm starving!

1163
01:30:52,769 --> 01:30:55,271
Monty, where you beenwe're
keeping it warm for you.

1164
01:30:56,773 --> 01:31:00,276
Wait a minute. Don't
get grease on the cards.

1165
01:31:01,778 --> 01:31:04,280
Gimme the red pepper,

1166
01:31:04,315 --> 01:31:06,783
Gimme a napkin.

1167
01:31:06,818 --> 01:31:09,786
What'd you tell her tonighttonight?

1168
01:31:10,286 --> 01:31:14,290
I told her her perfume
is driving me crazy.

1169
01:31:14,791 --> 01:31:18,795
Then i told her i married rose
to get to her.

1170
01:31:20,832 --> 01:31:22,799
Gimme a beer.

1171
01:31:22,834 --> 01:31:27,804
My mother-in-law. For years i wouldn't
kiss her face, i ended up kissin' her ass.

1172
01:31:34,811 --> 01:31:36,813
All right?

1173
01:31:45,857 --> 01:31:49,325
You don't have to talk
all night?

1174
01:31:49,360 --> 01:31:52,328
I'm a man
who can't say no?

1175
01:31:52,363 --> 01:31:55,832
You don't have to twist
my arm?

1176
01:31:55,867 --> 01:31:58,334
Just point me
where you wanna go?

1177
01:31:58,369 --> 01:32:01,337
Take me to the action
take me to the track?

1178
01:32:01,838 --> 01:32:04,340
Take me to a party if
they're bettin' in the back?

1179
01:32:04,375 --> 01:32:08,344
I've been workin' all my life
can't afford to wait?

1180
01:32:08,379 --> 01:32:11,347
Let me call my wife so
i can tell her i'll be late?

1181
01:32:11,382 --> 01:32:14,350
I want the easy

1182
01:32:14,385 --> 01:32:17,353
Easy, easy money?

1183
01:32:17,388 --> 01:32:20,356
I could get lucky?

1184
01:32:20,391 --> 01:32:23,860
Oh, things could go right?

1185
01:32:24,360 --> 01:32:27,363
I want the easy?

1186
01:32:27,398 --> 01:32:30,366
Easy, easy money?

1187
01:32:30,401 --> 01:32:33,870
Maybe this one time?

1188
01:32:33,905 --> 01:32:36,873
Maybe tonight?

1189
01:32:41,913 --> 01:32:45,381
You don't have
to try too hard?

1190
01:32:45,416 --> 01:32:48,885
I don't need
a song and dance?

1191
01:32:48,920 --> 01:32:51,888
I don't need
an invitation?

1192
01:32:52,388 --> 01:32:54,390
If you've got
a game of chance?

1193
01:32:54,425 --> 01:32:57,894
Take me to the tables
take me to the fights?

1194
01:32:57,929 --> 01:33:00,897
Run me like the numbers
roll me like the dice?

1195
01:33:00,932 --> 01:33:04,400
When you're countin' on a
killin' always count me in?

1196
01:33:04,435 --> 01:33:07,403
Talk me into losin'

1197
01:33:07,438 --> 01:33:10,406
I want the easy?

1198
01:33:10,441 --> 01:33:13,409
Easy, easy money?

1199
01:33:13,444 --> 01:33:16,412
I want the good times?

1200

Oh, i never had?

1201
01:33:20,416 --> 01:33:22,919
I want the easy?

1202
01:33:22,954 --> 01:33:25,922

Easy money

1206
01:33:37,468 --> 01:33:40,436
But better me than being
a fool for someone else?

1207
01:33:40,471 --> 01:33:45,942
I got a hot slot machine
of a system ready to go?

1208
01:33:45,977 --> 01:33:48,945
Easy money?

1209
01:33:48,980 --> 01:33:53,449
I got a one-track mind and a
good reputation layin' on the line?

1210
01:33:53,484 --> 01:33:55,952
I'll either come back
a bum or a king?

1211
01:33:56,452 --> 01:33:59,956
Baby, i don't know?

1212
01:33:59,991 --> 01:34:02,458
Ahh-hah?

1213
01:34:07,999 --> 01:34:11,467
You sure don't have
to start a fight?

1214
01:34:11,502 --> 01:34:14,470
I'm a man
who can't say no?

1215
01:34:14,505 --> 01:34:17,974
If you got
a little risky business?

1216
01:34:18,474 --> 01:34:20,476
Just point me
where you wanna go?

1217
01:34:20,511 --> 01:34:23,980
Take me to the power
take me to the heat?

1218
01:34:24,015 --> 01:34:26,983
Take me to the cleaners
if it's open to the streets?

1219
01:34:27,018 --> 01:34:30,486
Something's got to pay off
someone's got to break?

1220
01:34:30,521 --> 01:34:33,489
Someone's got a fortune that
they're begging me to take?

1221
01:34:33,524 --> 01:34:36,492
I want the easy?

1222
01:34:36,527 --> 01:34:39,495
Easy, easy money?

1223
01:34:39,530 --> 01:34:42,999
I could get lucky?

1224
01:34:43,034 --> 01:34:46,002
Things could go right?

1225
01:34:46,037 --> 01:34:49,505
Oh, i want the easy?

1226
01:34:49,540 --> 01:34:52,508
Easy, easy money?

1227
01:34:52,543 --> 01:34:55,511
Maybe just this time?

1228
01:34:55,546 --> 01:34:58,514
Oh, maybe tonight?

1229
01:34:58,549 --> 01:35:01,017
Easy money?

1230
01:35:01,517 --> 01:35:04,520
I don't want no hard cash?

1231
01:35:04,555 --> 01:35:08,524
I just want the easy money?

1232
01:35:08,559 --> 01:35:12,028
Oh, oh
i could get lucky?

1233
01:35:12,063 --> 01:35:14,030
Easy money?

1234
01:35:14,065 --> 01:35:19,035
Oh, i got to, got to-?

1235
01:35:20,035 --> 01:35:30,035
