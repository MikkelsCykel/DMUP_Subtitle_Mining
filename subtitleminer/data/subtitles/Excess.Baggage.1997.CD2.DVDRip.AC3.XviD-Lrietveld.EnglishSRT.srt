00:00:36,681 --> 00:00:39,354
<i>Thank God you're safe!</i>

2
00:00:39,521 --> 00:00:44,754
<i>- How much was the ransom?</i>
<i>- It doesn't matter. This girl does.</i>

3
00:00:47,241 --> 00:00:50,870
Do you want some more coffee?

4
00:00:51,041 --> 00:00:56,752
Hello. Are you okay?

5
00:00:58,761 --> 00:01:04,711
- Not having a happy day?
- I've never really had one.

6
00:01:05,921 --> 00:01:12,440
It's men, isn't it? They make you
promises they never intend to keep.

7
00:01:12,601 --> 00:01:18,551
They say they'll buy you a house,
but they don't. You can't trust 'em.

8
00:01:25,921 --> 00:01:29,072
She's not bad. I bought the CD, too.

9
00:01:29,241 --> 00:01:33,951
I might make you a gift of it
if things work out between us.

10
00:01:35,401 --> 00:01:39,189
That's a lot of money back there.

11
00:01:39,361 --> 00:01:47,473
- I earned it, and without a gun.
- You stole a lot of cars.

12
00:01:47,641 --> 00:01:52,669
- It pays well. What do you do?
- What did Emily say I do?

13
00:01:52,841 --> 00:01:56,675
Not much... but it don't look good.

14
00:01:56,841 --> 00:02:02,359
How come? Did I hurt you?
Did I shoot you in the groin?

15
00:02:05,881 --> 00:02:09,430
Are those options?

16
00:02:36,001 --> 00:02:39,630
Is that seat taken?

17
00:02:42,241 --> 00:02:45,039
Coffee, please.

18
00:02:52,121 --> 00:02:58,435
- Miss me?
- I guess. Was I supposed to?

19
00:03:03,081 --> 00:03:08,758
Look at this place.
This is really a slice of Americana.

20
00:03:08,921 --> 00:03:14,837
Yeah, Rockwell should've painted it.
I'm not going back with you.

21
00:03:15,001 --> 00:03:19,916
- Okay... Let's talk.
- Nothing to talk about.

22
00:03:20,081 --> 00:03:23,676
This is family business.
Let me go.

23
00:03:23,841 --> 00:03:27,436
<i>Vincenzo, por favor.</i>
Sit over there.

24
00:03:28,521 --> 00:03:34,278
- Did I lay a finger on you?
- No, he didn't do anything.

25
00:03:34,441 --> 00:03:40,232
Thank you. Who paid for that
motel room last night? Right, I did.

26
00:03:40,401 --> 00:03:45,031
- You're giving me a headache.
- I need some peace of mind here.

27
00:03:48,961 --> 00:03:51,634
Right.

28
00:03:54,561 --> 00:03:59,316
You look good. Pale, but good.

29
00:03:59,481 --> 00:04:03,474
How come you're pale?
I thought you lived in Costa Rica.

30
00:04:03,641 --> 00:04:06,235
I stay in the house a lot.

31
00:04:08,121 --> 00:04:14,356
If you're here because you're
worried about me, I appreciate it.

32
00:04:14,521 --> 00:04:20,471
But if my father ordered you
to bring me home, I'm not going.

33
00:04:21,121 --> 00:04:25,114
Emily... can we go someplace else?

34
00:04:25,281 --> 00:04:30,150
Don't you think it's strange that
my father isn't sitting here now?

35
00:04:30,321 --> 00:04:34,792
Yes, it's strange, but strange
and normal are not my job.

36
00:04:34,961 --> 00:04:40,433
This isn't about tattoos
and burning down the school library.

37
00:04:40,601 --> 00:04:47,120
- The cops and the FBI want you.
- Daddy's lawyers will get rich.

38
00:04:47,281 --> 00:04:50,353
They'll earn it this time.

39
00:04:54,281 --> 00:04:57,159
You're facing felony charges.

40
00:04:57,321 --> 00:05:02,554
Attempted grand theft.
Theft by deceit. Conspiracy...

41
00:05:02,721 --> 00:05:07,920
- What are you talking about?
- Tell me.

42
00:05:13,081 --> 00:05:18,075
I don't have my wallet.
There's the check for the coffee.

43
00:05:18,241 --> 00:05:25,556
I'll get the bag myself
and bring you back the keys.

44
00:05:25,721 --> 00:05:30,556
Yes! That's what I'm going to do.
Give my car keys to a car thief.

45
00:05:30,721 --> 00:05:38,036
I've been a good sport till now.
I can't wait much longer.

46
00:05:39,361 --> 00:05:43,400
- Go order yourself some waffles.
- Two minutes.

47
00:05:43,561 --> 00:05:48,919
Two minutes. I'm tired of tossing
salad, if you know what I mean.

48
00:05:54,841 --> 00:06:01,440
There goes my bargaining chip.
I'll give him to the police.

49
00:06:01,601 --> 00:06:05,674
- He could name names.
- You can't do that.

50
00:06:05,841 --> 00:06:10,551
- He's a thief.
- He's an innocent thief.

51
00:06:10,721 --> 00:06:14,873
What are you saying? Have you
formed some attachment to him?

52
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:18,875
You're not turning him in.

53
00:06:20,921 --> 00:06:24,118
I'm trying to keep you out of jail.

54
00:06:24,281 --> 00:06:28,069
Away from all those sociopathic,
gang-banging lesbians.

55
00:06:28,241 --> 00:06:33,474
With that mouth of yours, I'm sure
your dance card would be filled.

56
00:06:37,081 --> 00:06:41,552
I'll take you home.
I'm not asking.

57
00:06:41,721 --> 00:06:46,511
Let's go. What's wrong with you?

58
00:06:46,681 --> 00:06:49,912
I'm taking you home!

59
00:06:56,721 --> 00:07:02,000
I ain't going with you!
I never should've married you.

60
00:07:02,161 --> 00:07:06,040
My papa made me do it.
That man beat me!

61
00:07:06,201 --> 00:07:11,480
He's trying to keep me from my baby.
Vincent, let's go. He's got a gun.

62
00:07:11,641 --> 00:07:17,079
- This is good.
- He's got a gun!

63
00:07:17,241 --> 00:07:21,871
The lady wants to leave,
and you're not going to stop her.

64
00:07:22,961 --> 00:07:27,637
- I'm saving your ass.
- Save the trees.

65
00:07:27,801 --> 00:07:32,795
- It's not your concern.
- I'm making it my concern.

66
00:07:40,121 --> 00:07:44,399
- That could've been you.
- He landed on his head.

67
00:07:44,561 --> 00:07:48,998
He's going to turn you in
to try and clear my name.

68
00:07:49,161 --> 00:07:52,631
- It'd be your word against mine.
- Don't be a jackass.

69
00:07:52,801 --> 00:07:57,033
He's going to kill you.
I'll stand here and watch you die.

70
00:07:57,201 --> 00:07:59,920
Peace!

71
00:08:00,081 --> 00:08:05,075
- Do you think he's going to shoot?
- Yes, run!

72
00:08:33,321 --> 00:08:38,190
I'm the only person in the world
who can get your money back.

73
00:08:38,361 --> 00:08:44,596
- Quit being so stubborn.
- Right.

74
00:08:51,481 --> 00:08:54,041
Come on, get off.

75
00:09:21,081 --> 00:09:25,074
A guy left the keys in his pickup.
I'll start it up, and you jump in.

76
00:09:42,521 --> 00:09:47,356
We're gonna get pulled over.
I can feel it.

77
00:09:47,521 --> 00:09:51,309
- Just act like you own the car.
- How do I do that?

78
00:09:51,481 --> 00:09:54,791
- Act like you're in control.
- Where are we going?

79
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:57,919
- Knotty Pines.
- What for?

80
00:09:58,081 --> 00:10:03,872
So I can meet my man and say,
"Greg, how are you doing?"

81
00:10:04,041 --> 00:10:08,557
"It's so nice to see you.
I just got robbed of $200,000."

82
00:10:08,721 --> 00:10:11,872
"I enjoyed it. What? By her uncle."

83
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:16,478
- Is this science fiction, or what?
- Why tell him that?

84
00:10:16,641 --> 00:10:22,989
- That money doesn't belong to me.
- I'll get the money for you.

85
00:10:24,001 --> 00:10:28,916
- How are you going to do that?
- Trust me, I'll get you the money.

86
00:10:29,161 --> 00:10:36,351
If you can do that for me,
I'll give you a million thanks.

87
00:10:36,521 --> 00:10:40,275
- Start thanking me right now.
- All right, thank you.

88
00:10:50,841 --> 00:10:53,799
- Have you got a boyfriend?
- No.

89
00:10:53,961 --> 00:10:59,433
Why not? You're a pretty girl.

90
00:10:59,601 --> 00:11:04,391
Watch the road. I mean, you are.

91
00:11:04,561 --> 00:11:09,351
- You got a girlfriend?
- No, I gave that up.

92
00:11:09,521 --> 00:11:12,274
I always see the potential failure.

93
00:11:22,681 --> 00:11:28,597
- This is Greg from the warehouse.
- What's going on?

94
00:11:28,761 --> 00:11:32,879
I thought you lost her.
She's sitting here in front of you.

95
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:37,398
- Sit down. We need to talk.
- Yes, we do.

96
00:11:37,561 --> 00:11:40,951
- Hi.
- Scotch on the rocks.

97
00:11:41,121 --> 00:11:45,239
- Do you have any I. D.?
- Scotch for me. Chocolate for her.

98
00:11:45,401 --> 00:11:50,873
I really don't feel like
lounging over drinks in Heidi-land.

99
00:11:52,121 --> 00:11:56,034
- Just give me the bag.
- I don't have the bag.

100
00:11:56,201 --> 00:12:01,275
- Where is it?
- I left it in her uncle's car.

101
00:12:01,441 --> 00:12:06,469
You left it in her uncle's car?
God, I don't believe this!

102
00:12:06,641 --> 00:12:11,192
- Relax, it's not your problem.
- How the hell do you know?

103
00:12:11,361 --> 00:12:15,149
- They think we did this together.
- Why?

104
00:12:15,321 --> 00:12:22,397
Criminals think the worst of people.
They think we're in St. Bart's.

105
00:12:22,561 --> 00:12:26,793
- St. Bart's?
- Well, you'd have already gone.

106
00:12:27,601 --> 00:12:32,072
- Is she always like this?
- Yes, she don't listen.

107
00:12:32,241 --> 00:12:35,950
Her father's going to give us
the money. Right?

108
00:12:36,121 --> 00:12:41,559
- Her father? You said her uncle.
- My father will give it to him.

109
00:12:41,721 --> 00:12:47,000
- He gives it to me. Understand?
- Your father...

110
00:12:47,161 --> 00:12:51,916
- I don't believe this.
- Easier than collecting dust.

111
00:12:52,081 --> 00:12:56,632
I can't believe you brought her.
Thank you.

112
00:12:57,761 --> 00:13:00,400
Thank you.

113
00:13:04,921 --> 00:13:10,075
She's an alcoholic, too. Wonderful!
Drink much?

114
00:13:11,961 --> 00:13:15,670
I'll be taking this.
I'll get some toothpaste and a room.

115
00:13:15,841 --> 00:13:18,514
Yeah, go freshen up.

116
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:24,353
- Do you know what you're doing?
- She took your money.

117
00:13:25,081 --> 00:13:29,711
You make a great couple.
Like Bonnie and Clyde.

118
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:49,314
Emily? How did you know I was here?

119
00:13:49,481 --> 00:13:53,633
You can't do business at home
with the phone tapped.

120
00:13:53,801 --> 00:13:57,680
You had to be in your car,
on your plane, or on your boat.

121
00:13:57,841 --> 00:14:03,598
You're a very smart girl. You know
I have to be overseas tomorrow.

122
00:14:03,761 --> 00:14:08,915
<i>Was the timing of this whole fiasco</i>
<i>in any way connected with that?</i>

123
00:14:09,081 --> 00:14:15,475
- Leave? Your daughter's in peril.
- What do you want from me?

124
00:14:15,641 --> 00:14:20,271
Uncle Ray ripped off my friend.
When he's okay, I'll come home.

125
00:14:20,441 --> 00:14:24,559
<i>- Then you can get back to business.</i>
- Very well.

126
00:14:24,721 --> 00:14:29,158
<i>You have my word.</i>
<i>Meet me at the boat tomorrow.</i>

127
00:14:31,001 --> 00:14:35,040
When she does come back,
there'll be some trouble.

128
00:14:37,081 --> 00:14:40,994
I'll look after the police.
You take care of the rest.

129
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:45,556
I'll take care of it.

130
00:14:54,281 --> 00:14:58,797
- What does your father do?
- Businessman.

131
00:14:59,961 --> 00:15:04,910
- What does your mother do?
- She died when I was three.

132
00:15:05,081 --> 00:15:09,552
- I'm sorry about that.
- It's all right.

133
00:15:09,721 --> 00:15:13,919
- Can you remember her?
- No.

134
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:22,674
- Can I ask you a question?
- What?

135
00:15:22,841 --> 00:15:26,231
What are you running away from?

136
00:15:28,121 --> 00:15:30,681
I'm not running away.

137
00:15:32,481 --> 00:15:38,716
- I'm trying to get your money back.
- Come on...

138
00:15:41,201 --> 00:15:47,310
You're running away from something.
Why did you get in the trunk?

139
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:53,878
- Oh, we're talking about that.
- Yeah, I want to know about that.

140
00:15:56,521 --> 00:16:01,993
- I wanted to make my father feel.
- Make him feel what?

141
00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:04,470
Something.

142
00:16:04,641 --> 00:16:09,920
How can I explain 18 years
of being unwanted and unwelcome?

143
00:16:10,081 --> 00:16:15,633
- I was always a commodity to him.
- So you wanted to get even?

144
00:16:15,801 --> 00:16:21,637
I always thought that there was
no one in the whole world -

145
00:16:21,801 --> 00:16:27,433
- who could make me feel like I knew
who I was, except for my father.

146
00:16:27,601 --> 00:16:33,198
You find yourself.
You show yourself who you are.

147
00:16:33,361 --> 00:16:37,718
You don't need your father
to tell you who you are.

148
00:16:38,641 --> 00:16:43,431
Do you know what's the best way
to make a dream come true?

149
00:16:44,281 --> 00:16:47,910
Do you? Wake up.

150
00:16:49,361 --> 00:16:54,958
You'll find... your eternal mother.
You'll find whatever you want.

151
00:16:56,881 --> 00:16:59,873
It's true.

152
00:17:01,881 --> 00:17:05,590
- Is there any more gin?
- We finished the gin.

153
00:17:05,761 --> 00:17:10,676
No, we finished the vodka.
Maybe under your bed.

154
00:17:10,841 --> 00:17:16,757
- Why under my bed?
- You hogged 'em all.

155
00:17:16,921 --> 00:17:21,551
What have we got? Cognac.

156
00:17:22,721 --> 00:17:26,031
I don't want any cognac.

157
00:17:27,081 --> 00:17:34,351
I've got a question for you.
What do you want in the big picture?

158
00:17:34,521 --> 00:17:40,437
I want to open my own chain
of karaoke bars down in Brazil.

159
00:17:41,361 --> 00:17:48,756
A friend of mine told me
there's no karaoke bars in Brazil.

160
00:17:50,281 --> 00:17:55,355
- That's a stupid idea.
- It ain't stupid.

161
00:17:55,521 --> 00:17:59,116
I could be an entrepreneur.

162
00:17:59,281 --> 00:18:04,230
You want to make money
just so you can make more money?

163
00:18:04,401 --> 00:18:10,192
I've had that my whole life,
and it doesn't make you happy.

164
00:18:10,361 --> 00:18:14,354
It's not about the money, okay?

165
00:18:16,201 --> 00:18:23,789
I know what I do is wrong.
Believe me, I know.

166
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:31,478
I go home, get your money...
Then what do we do?

167
00:18:31,641 --> 00:18:34,201
We?

168
00:18:36,121 --> 00:18:41,479
If you want to come,
after we get that money...

169
00:18:41,641 --> 00:18:45,190
I don't want to intrude.
I've got my own stuff to do.

170
00:18:45,361 --> 00:18:49,400
No, really.
If you want to come, you can come.

171
00:18:49,561 --> 00:18:55,955
I'm telling you, you can come.
I'm not making a pass at you.

172
00:19:01,201 --> 00:19:03,999
Check it out.

173
00:19:04,161 --> 00:19:06,550
Those guys are fast.

174
00:19:06,721 --> 00:19:12,273
- Shut it off, please!
- I don't know how to.

175
00:19:12,441 --> 00:19:17,640
- Here you go. Happy?
- Yes.

176
00:19:17,801 --> 00:19:23,080
Listen, don't be telling anyone
about the karaoke plan.

177
00:19:25,481 --> 00:19:31,078
I've got rum, tequila and rum.
What would you like?

178
00:19:32,081 --> 00:19:36,233
You don't have to be drunk
to kiss me.

179
00:19:36,401 --> 00:19:39,996
Well, I'm not drunk.

180
00:20:00,281 --> 00:20:07,119
I stained my shirt. I was playing
with the hotel pen and it broke.

181
00:20:07,281 --> 00:20:12,435
There's postcards in the room.
People write on them.

182
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:29,590
Do you like my tummy?

183
00:20:34,001 --> 00:20:35,798
It's nice.

184
00:20:37,241 --> 00:20:43,032
- Do you like my laugh?
- If you smile.

185
00:20:46,241 --> 00:20:54,671
- I know you like my car.
- We never really got that close.

186
00:20:58,081 --> 00:21:02,120
I guess you like me.

187
00:21:10,801 --> 00:21:14,794
Let's go and have some breakfast.

188
00:22:13,361 --> 00:22:15,795
Get in there.

189
00:22:17,641 --> 00:22:20,109
Go.

190
00:22:29,561 --> 00:22:35,397
- So you spent the night together?
- What do you need her for?

191
00:22:35,561 --> 00:22:41,511
Are you kidding? We know who
her father is, and he's rich.

192
00:22:41,681 --> 00:22:46,550
- Greg knew I'd get the money.
- Greg's deadline has passed.

193
00:22:46,721 --> 00:22:50,953
- Right, Greg?
- I'm sorry!

194
00:22:51,121 --> 00:22:55,672
- They gave it to me, too.
- Shut up! You want some more?

195
00:22:55,841 --> 00:22:59,595
- Do you have to point that at me?
- Shut up.

196
00:22:59,761 --> 00:23:05,074
You're not stealing cars, she's
a human being. Are you on drugs?

197
00:23:05,241 --> 00:23:09,359
- Are you?
- Calm down, everybody.

198
00:23:09,521 --> 00:23:16,279
- Drive the car!
- I don't need this for 200 grand.

199
00:23:16,441 --> 00:23:21,754
We want a million. You can
yell and scream all you want.

200
00:23:23,121 --> 00:23:26,193
Great!

201
00:23:27,801 --> 00:23:30,679
Keep driving.

202
00:23:40,401 --> 00:23:44,110
- We want a million, cash.
- All right.

203
00:23:44,281 --> 00:23:47,478
Don't be late.

204
00:23:49,161 --> 00:23:54,030
This is serious.
I'm way out of my league.

205
00:23:54,201 --> 00:23:57,989
- Are you leaving?
- I'm out of here. First plane.

206
00:23:58,161 --> 00:24:03,315
Tell Mr. Dokas those guys took
his money and burnt his warehouse.

207
00:24:03,481 --> 00:24:08,839
- I'll take care of this.
- You've known that girl two days.

208
00:24:10,121 --> 00:24:13,670
I know. Make that phone call.

209
00:24:13,841 --> 00:24:18,676
Vincent...! Christ!

210
00:24:21,721 --> 00:24:24,030
Emily Hope.

211
00:24:24,201 --> 00:24:31,915
DOKAS

212
00:24:42,201 --> 00:24:47,321
- I'm going to call Dokas.
- I'll get the luggage.

213
00:24:47,481 --> 00:24:51,110
Wake up, my little princess.

214
00:24:54,681 --> 00:25:00,438
Give Mr. Dokas a message.
The situation's under control.

215
00:25:01,721 --> 00:25:04,633
We've got all his money.

216
00:25:07,841 --> 00:25:12,961
I'll call you back
to make the final arrangements.

217
00:25:13,121 --> 00:25:17,637
- Put me down!
- Put her upstairs in the office.

218
00:25:30,281 --> 00:25:35,036
- We were expecting Emily.
- She's been kidnapped.

219
00:25:35,201 --> 00:25:42,755
- They want a million dollars.
- I've a distinct sense of deja vu.

220
00:25:42,921 --> 00:25:48,757
- She ain't crying wolf this time.
- What's your relationship to her?

221
00:25:48,921 --> 00:25:54,757
I didn't do what she said I did on
the phone, if that's what you mean.

222
00:25:54,921 --> 00:26:00,996
- She knows I'm leaving the country.
- Sir, you're not listening.

223
00:26:01,161 --> 00:26:09,079
They want a million dollars
plus the 200,000 he stole from me.

224
00:26:09,241 --> 00:26:14,395
They're stupid and dangerous.
That's a bad combination.

225
00:26:14,561 --> 00:26:20,272
Perhaps, but I've already paid
a million dollars once this week -

226
00:26:20,441 --> 00:26:24,798
- and I have no intention
of going to the well again.

227
00:26:24,961 --> 00:26:30,911
It ain't about money.
It's about your daughter.

228
00:26:31,081 --> 00:26:33,993
Isn't she worth a million dollars?

229
00:26:35,881 --> 00:26:40,318
Mr. Perkins will return the money
he took from you, not a cent more.

230
00:26:42,001 --> 00:26:49,237
Turn your back on me, but don't
turn your back on your daughter.

231
00:26:49,401 --> 00:26:52,677
You have your money.
Now get out of here.

232
00:26:52,841 --> 00:26:57,869
I've known this girl for two days.
Do I care more about her than you?

233
00:26:58,041 --> 00:27:03,957
You son of a bitch! You should've
sold her when she was born for cash!

234
00:27:05,001 --> 00:27:08,550
This is not the place for that.
Come on.

235
00:27:09,401 --> 00:27:12,518
Scumbag!

236
00:27:17,001 --> 00:27:21,677
- Come on.
- Get out of here, man.

237
00:27:25,601 --> 00:27:32,359
- I have a plane to catch.
- Make sure she's okay first.

238
00:27:33,081 --> 00:27:37,552
You make sure she's okay.

239
00:27:52,881 --> 00:27:57,352
Put that thing in a paper cup
and let's go.

240
00:28:02,801 --> 00:28:06,794
- Where is she?
- Show me the money.

241
00:28:10,801 --> 00:28:14,589
- Watch out.
- How do I know you have the money?

242
00:28:14,761 --> 00:28:21,360
You're going to have to trust me.
I've got to see she's all right.

243
00:28:21,521 --> 00:28:26,879
There's a protocol with this.
I get the money. You stay here.

244
00:28:27,041 --> 00:28:30,829
- Hi, how are you doing?
- Good.

245
00:28:31,001 --> 00:28:35,950
- How's it going? Who are you?
- I'm with Vincent.

246
00:28:36,121 --> 00:28:40,080
- He's my friend.
- He's my bodyguard.

247
00:28:40,241 --> 00:28:44,792
That's a Colt Python
with a silencer up your ass.

248
00:28:46,881 --> 00:28:49,554
How does it feel, Stick?

249
00:28:49,721 --> 00:28:55,318
- Walk. You better tag along.
- Did I surprise you?

250
00:30:20,121 --> 00:30:25,593
- May I ask you something?
- I don't know. Ask me.

251
00:30:25,761 --> 00:30:29,197
How could you work
for a jerk-off like that?

252
00:30:30,561 --> 00:30:34,634
What do you mean?
We go back a long way.

253
00:30:34,801 --> 00:30:40,353
- You should've looked after her.
- I did that, too.

254
00:30:40,521 --> 00:30:45,390
It was my job to make sure
she could take care of herself.

255
00:30:49,441 --> 00:30:52,513
- She's got some ass!
- Your mother's got some ass.

256
00:30:52,681 --> 00:30:55,912
- What's your name?
- Stick.

257
00:30:56,081 --> 00:31:00,916
- Stick? Drive.
- All right.

258
00:31:01,081 --> 00:31:05,597
I'm her uncle. Watch your mouth.

259
00:31:30,041 --> 00:31:31,952
Gus?

260
00:31:33,561 --> 00:31:39,875
- Hands up. Is he armed?
- Hey, your money. Where's the girl?

261
00:31:40,041 --> 00:31:47,914
Give me that bag. As I was
trying to say, there's a protocol.

262
00:31:48,081 --> 00:31:51,835
I check the money. Understand?

263
00:31:52,001 --> 00:31:55,880
- That's a nice car.
- Stand still and shut up.

264
00:31:56,041 --> 00:32:00,751
A million bucks.
I've waited a long time for this.

265
00:32:00,921 --> 00:32:07,520
- There's no million dollars here!
- That's what I owe.

266
00:32:07,681 --> 00:32:12,835
- Can't anybody count around here?
- That's what I owe.

267
00:32:13,001 --> 00:32:19,873
The 500 SL is a beauty, but do I
need that kind of horsepower?

268
00:32:20,961 --> 00:32:23,794
- Who is this guy?
- Her uncle.

269
00:32:23,961 --> 00:32:26,350
I trusted you.

270
00:32:28,841 --> 00:32:33,119
He took 800,000.
He ripped us off, man!

271
00:32:33,281 --> 00:32:38,275
- Step up with the girl.
- Did you rip us off, man?

272
00:32:38,441 --> 00:32:43,071
Did you rip us off?
Don't be stupid.

273
00:32:47,361 --> 00:32:52,754
- What did I say? What?
- Let's get back to business.

274
00:32:52,921 --> 00:32:56,800
Did we disturb your shopping spree?

275
00:32:56,961 --> 00:33:00,476
Do you like that car? Do you?

276
00:33:02,521 --> 00:33:06,275
- That's not right.
- What?

277
00:33:06,441 --> 00:33:12,118
- I have to see the girl's okay.
- We want the money first.

278
00:33:12,281 --> 00:33:18,117
- Or do you want half the girl?
- You think we're fooling around?

279
00:33:19,481 --> 00:33:24,316
Don't do it.

280
00:33:44,921 --> 00:33:48,755
It looks like we're about done here.
Give me the gun.

281
00:33:54,401 --> 00:33:59,680
I know what I'm going to do
with you, but what about you?

282
00:34:01,521 --> 00:34:05,560
Your father's instructions were
not to let you embarrass him.

283
00:34:11,281 --> 00:34:14,796
Are you going to kill me?

284
00:34:16,321 --> 00:34:20,394
No, he's not.

285
00:34:21,041 --> 00:34:24,795
What are you saying?

286
00:34:24,961 --> 00:34:28,715
This is for him?

287
00:34:33,921 --> 00:34:38,631
No, it's for me.

288
00:34:42,801 --> 00:34:47,079
- Hope residence.
- Is my father there?

289
00:34:52,921 --> 00:34:56,630
- What happened?
- We got a trace. 260 Terminal.

290
00:35:39,161 --> 00:35:42,517
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

291
00:35:42,681 --> 00:35:48,119
She's had a hard time.
The kidnappers are tied up inside.

292
00:35:50,361 --> 00:35:52,921
Come on.

293
00:35:55,801 --> 00:36:01,910
- I guess you don't need me now.
- I can always use my friend.

294
00:36:03,281 --> 00:36:05,795
I'm only a phone call away.

295
00:36:20,681 --> 00:36:27,314
This is damage control. My lawyers
will prepare your statement.

296
00:36:27,481 --> 00:36:32,953
- I'll tell them I started this.
- Why would you want to do that?

297
00:36:33,121 --> 00:36:38,320
It's my mess. It's my responsibility
to sort things out.

298
00:36:46,361 --> 00:36:53,233
- Well, it's good to have you home.
- I'm going to be moving out.

299
00:36:54,801 --> 00:36:57,554
Emily!

300
00:36:57,721 --> 00:37:03,557
As distasteful as it may be to you,
you're still my daughter.

301
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:07,680
And I'm still your father.

302
00:37:08,601 --> 00:37:12,276
I know.

303
00:38:22,121 --> 00:38:26,797
Not bad. How are you doing?

304
00:38:26,961 --> 00:38:30,510
I've seen better days.

305
00:38:34,241 --> 00:38:40,271
I'm hot. Sit down.
I need to decompress.

306
00:38:40,921 --> 00:38:44,197
Red wine.

307
00:38:44,361 --> 00:38:50,197
Is that for me?
1991... my favourite.

308
00:38:58,881 --> 00:39:02,191
You want some?

309
00:39:02,361 --> 00:39:05,831
How old are you?

310
00:39:08,521 --> 00:39:11,797
Old enough.

311
00:39:14,201 --> 00:39:18,479
Oh yeah... what a view!

312
00:39:19,961 --> 00:39:23,795
I mean, that's a view.

313
00:39:27,881 --> 00:39:31,510
What makes this a view?

314
00:39:36,001 --> 00:39:38,435
You.

315
00:39:47,761 --> 00:39:51,879
Come on. Come on.

316
00:39:52,879 --> 00:40:02,879
