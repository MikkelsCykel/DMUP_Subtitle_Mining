<i>What can you say about</i>
<i>a 25-year-old girl who died?</i>

2
00:00:56.348 --> 00:00:59.351
<i>That she was beautiful and brilliant?</i>

3
00:01:00.728 --> 00:01:04.148
<i>That she loved Mozart and Bach?</i>

4
00:01:04.482 --> 00:01:06.984
<i>The Beatles?</i>

5
00:01:07.193 --> 00:01:09.153
<i>And me?</i>

6
00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.298
- Do you have this book?
- You have your own library.

7
00:01:29.507 --> 00:01:32.927
- Answer my question.
- Answer mine first.

8
00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.763
We're allowed to use
the Radcliffe library.

9
00:01:35.971 --> 00:01:38.682
I'm not talking legality,
I'm talking ethics.

10
00:01:38.891 --> 00:01:42.436
Harvard's got five million books,
Radcliffe a few thousand.

11
00:01:42.645 --> 00:01:46.065
I only want one. I've got
an hour exam tomorrow, damn it!

12
00:01:46.398 --> 00:01:49.944
Please watch your profanity, preppy.

13
00:01:51.403 --> 00:01:53.989
Why do you think
I went to prep school?

14
00:01:54.198 --> 00:01:58.285
- You look stupid and rich.
- Actually, I'm smart and poor.

15
00:01:58.494 --> 00:02:00.663
No, I'm smart and poor.

16
00:02:00.871 --> 00:02:04.625
- Why are you so smart?
- I won't have coffee with you.

17
00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:08.712
- I wouldn't ask you.
- That's what makes you stupid.

18
00:02:12.758 --> 00:02:16.303
Comp. Lit. 105. Not bad.

19
00:02:16.512 --> 00:02:22.268
Music 150. Not bad.
Music 201, that's a graduate course.

20
00:02:22.476 --> 00:02:25.062
- Renaissance polyphony.
- What's polyphony?

21
00:02:25.271 --> 00:02:27.982
Nothing sexual, preppy.

22
00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.901
I told you, my name is Oliver.

23
00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.112
- First or last?
- First.

24
00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.740
- Oliver what?
- Barrett.

25
00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:41.328
- Barrett like the poet?
- Yeah, no relation.

26
00:02:41.537 --> 00:02:45.624
- Barrett like the hall?
- Yes.

27
00:02:45.833 --> 00:02:48.836
I'm having coffee
with a Harvard building.

28
00:02:49.044 --> 00:02:53.215
I'm not Barrett Hall. My great
grandfather just gave it to Harvard.

29
00:02:53.424 --> 00:02:56.885
So his not-so-great grandson
could get in?

30
00:02:57.094 --> 00:03:03.017
If you think I'm a loser, why did you
bulldoze me into buying you coffee?

31
00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.562
I like your body.

32
00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:16.572
- I major in Social Studies.
- It doesn't show.

33
00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.868
- It's an honours programme.
- I know you've got a few brains.

34
00:03:21.076 --> 00:03:25.330
- Really?
- You're hung up on me, aren't you?

35
00:03:29.918 --> 00:03:32.421
- Jenny?
- Yeah?

36
00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:37.134
Listen, you Radcliffe bitch.
There's a hockey game on Friday.

37
00:03:37.342 --> 00:03:40.262
- So?
- I want you to come.

38
00:03:40.471 --> 00:03:44.099
Why would I go
to a lousy hockey game?

39
00:03:44.308 --> 00:03:47.227
- Because I'm playing.
- For which side?

40
00:04:26.642 --> 00:04:29.770
Two minutes for number seven.
Holding.

41
00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:35.943
<i>Penalty. Barrett, Harvard.</i>
<i>Two minutes. Holding.</i>

42
00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:48.539
Why are you here
when your friends are playing?

43
00:04:48.872 --> 00:04:51.583
I'm in the penalty box.

44
00:04:51.792 --> 00:04:54.503
- What did you do?
- I tried too hard.

45
00:04:54.711 --> 00:04:57.714
- Is that a big disgrace?
- I'm trying to concentrate.

46
00:04:58.048 --> 00:05:00.759
- On what?
- On how I'll total that bastard.

47
00:05:00.968 --> 00:05:03.554
Come on, Harvard, let's go!

48
00:05:03.762 --> 00:05:07.224
Are you a dirty player?
Would you ever total me?

49
00:05:07.432 --> 00:05:11.812
- I will right now if you don't shut up.
- I'm leaving. Goodbye.

50
00:05:21.196 --> 00:05:26.076
<i>Barrett back in the game.</i>
<i>Harvard have full strength.</i>

51
00:05:58.317 --> 00:06:03.196
<i>And a goal. Ackerman.</i>
<i>Assist, Barrett.</i>

52
00:06:03.405 --> 00:06:07.159
- Now I've seen a hockey game.
- What did you like best?

53
00:06:07.367 --> 00:06:10.912
- When you were on your ass.
- Thanks for coming.

54
00:06:11.246 --> 00:06:14.041
I didn't say you could kiss me.

55
00:06:14.374 --> 00:06:17.377
- I was carried away.
- I wasn't.

56
00:06:21.339 --> 00:06:24.051
I may not call you for a few months,

57
00:06:24.384 --> 00:06:27.721
or I might call you
when I get back to my room.

58
00:06:27.929 --> 00:06:31.892
- Bastard.
- You can dish it out, but not take it.

59
00:06:39.274 --> 00:06:41.276
- Hello, animals.
- Hey, Ollie.

60
00:06:41.485 --> 00:06:44.279
- What did you get?
- An assist.

61
00:06:44.488 --> 00:06:47.741
- Off Cavilleri?
- None of your business.

62
00:06:47.949 --> 00:06:51.286
- I'm your roommate!
- Has Barrett got a new goodie?

63
00:06:51.495 --> 00:06:56.374
Jenny Cavilleri.
It's a music type from Rhode Island.

64
00:06:56.583 --> 00:07:01.505
- I know her. Real tight-ass.
- Plays piano for the Bach Society.

65
00:07:01.713 --> 00:07:06.802
- What does she play with Barrett?
- Probably hard to get.

66
00:07:07.135 --> 00:07:09.429
Simpson. Up yours.

67
00:07:10.972 --> 00:07:12.766
That proves it.

68
00:07:30.283 --> 00:07:32.452
Hello, Jen?

69
00:07:32.661 --> 00:07:38.291
What would you say if I told you...
I think I'm in love with you?

70
00:07:38.625 --> 00:07:45.382
Never say "love" if you don't mean it.
You're a known quantity.

71
00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:46.842
Meaning?

72
00:07:47.175 --> 00:07:52.264
You're known for quantity.
At Radcliffe, every hall is Barrett Hall.

73
00:07:53.515 --> 00:07:59.354
- You've been checking up on me.
- I won't dine outdoors with anybody.

74
00:08:00.605 --> 00:08:04.568
- Am I just anybody?
- What do you think, preppy?

75
00:08:08.655 --> 00:08:12.284
You'll have to fend for yourself
this weekend.

76
00:08:13.326 --> 00:08:17.289
I'll be mixing it up
with Francis LaPierre.

77
00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:21.793
- Very funny.
- Are you jealous?

78
00:08:22.002 --> 00:08:25.755
He's the captain
of the Cornell hockey team.

79
00:08:25.964 --> 00:08:29.092
You've been reading the sports page.

80
00:08:35.974 --> 00:08:40.020
I wouldn't mind
watching you play against Cornell.

81
00:08:40.228 --> 00:08:43.565
No. I'll be involved.

82
00:08:43.773 --> 00:08:47.527
Oh, yeah. The All-Ivy title.

83
00:08:54.117 --> 00:08:56.619
- More than the All-Ivy title?
- A lot more.

84
00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:07.130
<i>Cornell goal.</i>
<i>Score tied, 3-3.</i>

85
00:09:12.761 --> 00:09:15.472
Come on, man! Quit!

86
00:09:23.313 --> 00:09:26.733
I'll kick your ass back to Montreal!

87
00:09:32.697 --> 00:09:34.449
Get up!

88
00:09:36.242 --> 00:09:39.037
You're out of the game, Barrett.
Come on!

89
00:09:40.914 --> 00:09:46.044
<i>- Je vais te casser la gueule!</i>
- I'll break yours before mine!

90
00:09:46.252 --> 00:09:49.881
Come on, Barrett, get off the ice!

91
00:09:55.011 --> 00:09:58.431
You Montreal faggots!

92
00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:01.684
What? Francis LaPierre
started the fight!

93
00:10:01.893 --> 00:10:04.062
- Get in!
- Come on!

94
00:10:04.395 --> 00:10:06.898
Five minutes for number seven. Fight.

95
00:10:07.107 --> 00:10:12.403
<i>Penalty. Barrett, Harvard.</i>
<i>Five minutes for fighting.</i>

96
00:11:25.518 --> 00:11:28.938
You probably want a steak, son.

97
00:11:29.147 --> 00:11:31.774
No, thanks. The doctor took care of it.

98
00:11:31.983 --> 00:11:34.986
I meant for your stomach, Oliver.

99
00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:41.451
- I'm supposed to eat with the team.
- Oh, that's fine.

100
00:11:41.659 --> 00:11:44.704
- Does your face hurt?
- No, sir.

101
00:11:46.581 --> 00:11:51.169
- Jack Wells should take a look at it.
- That's not necessary.

102
00:11:51.377 --> 00:11:55.006
- Jack's a specialist.
- It's nothing special.

103
00:11:56.174 --> 00:12:01.262
- My car's there. Can I give you a lift?
- I'll walk you to your car.

104
00:12:02.513 --> 00:12:05.850
Have you heard from the Law School?

105
00:12:06.059 --> 00:12:09.520
I haven't exactly decided
on the Law School.

106
00:12:09.729 --> 00:12:15.360
I was merely asking
if the Law School had decided on you.

107
00:12:15.568 --> 00:12:18.154
- No.
- There really isn't any doubt.

108
00:12:18.363 --> 00:12:22.950
- About what?
- The school needs good men like you.

109
00:12:23.284 --> 00:12:28.373
- They haven't got a hockey team.
- You have other qualities, Oliver.

110
00:12:30.041 --> 00:12:32.752
I'm sorry you had to see Harvard lose.

111
00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:36.005
I came to see you play.

112
00:12:37.548 --> 00:12:41.094
The Dean of the school
is an old classmate...

113
00:12:41.302 --> 00:12:43.513
That's very nice, sir.

114
00:12:46.849 --> 00:12:50.478
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, sir.

115
00:12:54.565 --> 00:12:57.568
- Give my best to Mother.
- Yes, I will.

116
00:13:21.134 --> 00:13:23.636
Briggs Hall. Sandy Davidson.

117
00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:26.139
Jennifer Cavilleri.

118
00:13:26.347 --> 00:13:29.475
You have a call.
She's in the downstairs phone booth.

119
00:13:29.809 --> 00:13:32.937
- Where is that?
- Around the corner.

120
00:13:35.731 --> 00:13:39.819
Would you please...
For God's sake, Phil!

121
00:13:40.736 --> 00:13:46.159
Yes. Yeah, yeah,
for the million-and-oneth time, yeah!

122
00:13:46.492 --> 00:13:50.663
Absolutely! Oh, I love you, too, Phil.

123
00:13:51.372 --> 00:13:54.083
Yeah, I love you, too.

124
00:13:54.292 --> 00:13:56.168
Goodbye.

125
00:13:58.170 --> 00:14:02.008
- What happened? You look terrible.
- I'm injured.

126
00:14:02.216 --> 00:14:04.844
Did you make
the other guy look worse?

127
00:14:05.052 --> 00:14:08.180
I always make
the other guy look worse.

128
00:14:09.015 --> 00:14:11.392
- Jenny?
- Yeah?

129
00:14:11.601 --> 00:14:15.062
- Who's Phil?
- My father.

130
00:14:18.274 --> 00:14:20.484
You call your father Phil?

131
00:14:20.693 --> 00:14:24.238
- It's his name, what do you call yours?
- Son-of-a-bitch.

132
00:14:24.447 --> 00:14:27.450
- To his face?
- I never see his face.

133
00:14:27.658 --> 00:14:31.120
- Why? Does he wear a mask?
- In a way.

134
00:14:31.329 --> 00:14:34.749
He must be proud.
You're a Harvard jock.

135
00:14:34.957 --> 00:14:38.502
- So was he.
- Bigger than All-Ivy?

136
00:14:38.711 --> 00:14:42.882
He rowed single sculls
in the 1928 Olympics.

137
00:14:43.090 --> 00:14:45.801
- Did he win?
- No.

138
00:14:46.010 --> 00:14:49.138
- Then why is he a son-of-a-bitch?
- He leans on me.

139
00:14:49.347 --> 00:14:53.017
- He makes me do the right things.
- So?

140
00:14:53.225 --> 00:14:58.731
I don't like to have to put out X amount
of achievement every term.

141
00:14:58.939 --> 00:15:02.193
You hate making the Dean's list
and being All-Ivy!

142
00:15:02.401 --> 00:15:07.823
He expects no less, and when
I come through, he is so indifferent.

143
00:15:08.032 --> 00:15:11.035
- Ridiculous!
- And what did he say after the game?

144
00:15:11.369 --> 00:15:13.663
He went all that way to watch you play?

145
00:15:13.871 --> 00:15:19.919
After I was nearly massacred
by the wild Canadian hordes,

146
00:15:20.127 --> 00:15:22.505
do you know what he said to his son?

147
00:15:22.838 --> 00:15:27.093
- Whores in Ithaca?
- "I know the Dean of the Law School."

148
00:15:27.301 --> 00:15:30.763
What did you expect him to say?
"How is your sex life?"

149
00:15:30.971 --> 00:15:35.851
- Whose side are you on?
- I didn't know it was a war.

150
00:15:36.686 --> 00:15:40.981
- You don't understand.
- More than you wish I did.

151
00:15:41.190 --> 00:15:45.152
Did the son-of-a-bitch
at least get lousy grades?

152
00:15:45.361 --> 00:15:50.866
- He was a Rhodes scholar.
- There's a problem of overachievement.

153
00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:54.829
- Forget about it. There's no problem.
- Right.

154
00:15:55.162 --> 00:16:00.584
Do I call my father on the phone?
Do I say, "l love you, Phil?"

155
00:16:00.793 --> 00:16:03.379
- No.
- There you are.

156
00:16:03.712 --> 00:16:08.509
And do you know why?
Because his name is Oliver.

157
00:16:10.386 --> 00:16:14.765
The great Barrett Hall.
Don't you salute when you pass it?

158
00:16:14.974 --> 00:16:19.145
- It's ugly. I've never been inside.
- That's a mature attitude.

159
00:16:19.353 --> 00:16:22.481
It's not easy living with history.

160
00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:27.361
- How many have to cope with that?
- I could name two.

161
00:16:28.612 --> 00:16:30.698
Thanks.

162
00:16:42.585 --> 00:16:46.046
<i>Must you play music while we study?</i>

163
00:16:46.255 --> 00:16:50.217
<i>I'm studying the music.</i>
<i>It's called "Analysis of Form".</i>

164
00:16:50.426 --> 00:16:51.760
<i>Yeah...</i>

165
00:16:51.969 --> 00:16:54.805
<i>You'll flunk if you just stare at me.</i>

166
00:16:55.014 --> 00:16:59.476
<i>- I'm not. I'm studying.</i>
<i>- Bullshit. You're looking at my legs.</i>

167
00:16:59.685 --> 00:17:04.064
<i>- You're not that great looking.</i>
<i>- I can't help if you think so.</i>

168
00:17:04.273 --> 00:17:08.235
<i>- Let's change the subject.</i>
<i>- I wasn't aware there was one.</i>

169
00:17:08.444 --> 00:17:12.406
<i>You think that I wanted</i>
<i>to make love to you.</i>

170
00:17:12.615 --> 00:17:18.370
<i>- But I'm not interested.</i>
<i>- Then we've got one thing in common.</i>

171
00:17:18.579 --> 00:17:24.710
I'm tired of playing your game.
You are a supreme Radcliffe smart-ass.

172
00:17:24.919 --> 00:17:27.630
The best. You put down
anything in pants.

173
00:17:27.838 --> 00:17:31.800
But verbal volleyball
is not my idea of a relationship.

174
00:17:32.009 --> 00:17:37.139
If that's what you think it's all about,
go back to your music waltz.

175
00:17:39.016 --> 00:17:44.647
I think you're scared. You put up
a wall to keep from getting hurt,

176
00:17:44.855 --> 00:17:49.526
but it also keeps you
from getting touched.

177
00:17:49.735 --> 00:17:53.405
It's a risk, isn't it, Jenny?

178
00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:58.827
At least I had the guts
to admit what I felt.

179
00:17:59.536 --> 00:18:04.541
Some day you'll have to come up with
the courage to admit that you care.

180
00:18:08.420 --> 00:18:11.006
I care.

181
00:19:06.895 --> 00:19:11.692
- Would your priest like this?
- I don't have one.

182
00:19:13.485 --> 00:19:19.616
- Aren't you a good Catholic girl?
- Well, I'm a girl...

183
00:19:21.285 --> 00:19:23.996
...and I'm good, right?

184
00:19:26.081 --> 00:19:29.751
So that's two out of three.

185
00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:34.214
- Why do you wear it?
- It was my mother's.

186
00:19:34.548 --> 00:19:38.802
Why did you leave the Church?

187
00:19:39.761 --> 00:19:44.016
I don't know.
I never really joined.

188
00:19:45.684 --> 00:19:50.898
I never thought there was another world
better than this one.

189
00:19:52.149 --> 00:19:56.111
What could be better than Mozart?

190
00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:58.197
Or Bach?

191
00:19:59.364 --> 00:20:00.824
Or you?

192
00:20:03.118 --> 00:20:04.870
Jenny?

193
00:20:07.789 --> 00:20:10.834
I'm up there with Bach and Mozart?

194
00:20:12.711 --> 00:20:15.297
And The Beatles.

195
00:20:25.933 --> 00:20:29.186
- Let me sack in your couch.
- How come?

196
00:20:29.394 --> 00:20:32.397
- Barrett.
- Who's the guest of honour?

197
00:20:32.606 --> 00:20:36.151
- Cavilleri.
- Again? Still?

198
00:20:36.485 --> 00:20:38.862
Barrett's slipping.

199
00:20:57.005 --> 00:20:59.424
It's amazing.

200
00:21:02.970 --> 00:21:05.555
I'm really studying.

201
00:21:06.181 --> 00:21:09.643
- I'm studying.
- Sorry.

202
00:21:17.150 --> 00:21:19.319
Oliver?

203
00:21:22.572 --> 00:21:24.324
I love you.

204
00:24:34.848 --> 00:24:36.808
You were great.

205
00:24:37.017 --> 00:24:40.145
- You know nothing about music.
- I know enough.

206
00:24:40.478 --> 00:24:46.192
Wise up, would you please, Barrett?
I wasn't great or All-Ivy, just OK. OK?

207
00:24:47.569 --> 00:24:48.903
OK.

208
00:24:49.112 --> 00:24:54.117
- I mean you should keep at it.
- Who said I won't?

209
00:24:54.451 --> 00:24:57.245
I'm going to study
with Nadia Boulanger.

210
00:24:57.454 --> 00:24:58.913
Who?

211
00:24:59.122 --> 00:25:03.084
Next year.
I have a scholarship in Paris.

212
00:25:03.918 --> 00:25:05.170
Paris?

213
00:25:05.503 --> 00:25:09.549
Yeah, I've never been to Europe.
I can hardly wait.

214
00:25:09.758 --> 00:25:13.845
- How long have you known?
- It's inevitable.

215
00:25:14.053 --> 00:25:15.388
What is?

216
00:25:15.597 --> 00:25:18.850
That we'll separate.
You'll go to Law School.

217
00:25:19.058 --> 00:25:24.063
- What are you talking about?
- You're a millionaire, I'm a social zero.

218
00:25:24.272 --> 00:25:28.651
What do you mean?
We're together, we're happy.

219
00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:34.282
Harvard is like a bag full of toys,
but when the holiday is over,

220
00:25:34.491 --> 00:25:37.494
you have to go back
where you belong.

221
00:25:37.702 --> 00:25:42.499
- Back to bake cookies?
- Pastries. Don't make fun of my father.

222
00:25:42.707 --> 00:25:45.835
Then don't leave me, Jenny!

223
00:25:49.714 --> 00:25:51.674
Please.

224
00:25:52.717 --> 00:25:57.222
What about my scholarship
and Paris, which I've never seen?

225
00:25:57.430 --> 00:26:02.852
- What about our marriage?
- Who said anything about marriage?

226
00:26:03.061 --> 00:26:05.980
I'm saying it, now.

227
00:26:06.189 --> 00:26:09.400
You want to marry me?

228
00:26:10.443 --> 00:26:11.819
Yeah.

229
00:26:12.654 --> 00:26:14.739
Why?

230
00:26:20.787 --> 00:26:23.164
Because.

231
00:26:26.292 --> 00:26:29.003
That's a good reason.

232
00:26:46.437 --> 00:26:51.109
- You're driving like a maniac.
- Everybody does in Boston.

233
00:26:51.317 --> 00:26:54.445
You'll kill us before
your parents can murder us.

234
00:26:54.654 --> 00:26:58.616
- My parents will love you.
- Even the son-of-a-bitch?

235
00:26:58.825 --> 00:27:02.912
Of course. Where is
the old Radcliffe confidence?

236
00:27:03.121 --> 00:27:07.375
- Back at Radcliffe.
- It's going to be OK, Jenny.

237
00:27:07.583 --> 00:27:11.546
- What did you say on the phone?
- Just that I'd drop by.

238
00:27:11.879 --> 00:27:14.674
- Very casual, huh?
- Yeah, right.

239
00:27:15.008 --> 00:27:18.011
How often do you visit during a term?

240
00:27:18.219 --> 00:27:21.764
- Never.
- Oh, that's casual...

241
00:27:53.379 --> 00:27:55.757
Holy shit!

242
00:28:00.762 --> 00:28:04.098
Stop, Oliver. No kidding, stop the car.

243
00:28:13.399 --> 00:28:16.402
I didn't think it would be like this.

244
00:28:16.611 --> 00:28:19.447
- Like what?
- I mean, like this rich.

245
00:28:20.490 --> 00:28:26.120
- This is too much for me.
- Don't worry. lt'll be a breeze.

246
00:28:26.329 --> 00:28:32.460
Yeah, but why do I wish my name
were Abigail Adams or Wendy Wasp?

247
00:28:35.379 --> 00:28:38.007
Don't be scared.

248
00:28:38.216 --> 00:28:41.552
- Aren't you?
- No.

249
00:28:59.987 --> 00:29:03.032
- So far, so good.
- That's not saying much.

250
00:29:03.241 --> 00:29:05.827
- Your hand is cold.
- So is yours.

251
00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:10.748
- Let's get away from here.
- Master Oliver! Hello!

252
00:29:10.957 --> 00:29:13.960
Hello, Florence. This is Jenny.

253
00:29:14.293 --> 00:29:17.421
"Master"? I always knew
you had slaves.

254
00:29:21.384 --> 00:29:26.597
Let me take your wrap.
Your parents are in the drawing room.

255
00:29:30.017 --> 00:29:32.728
Thank you, Florence.

256
00:29:34.730 --> 00:29:37.942
Half the buildings of Harvard
are hanging there.

257
00:29:38.150 --> 00:29:40.653
Oh, it's nothing.

258
00:29:40.861 --> 00:29:43.781
You're related to
the Sewall Boat House?

259
00:29:43.990 --> 00:29:48.286
Yes, I come from a long line
of wood and stone.

260
00:29:57.461 --> 00:29:59.338
Hello there.

261
00:30:01.215 --> 00:30:05.386
- I'd like you to meet Jennifer Calaveri.
- Cavilleri.

262
00:30:05.595 --> 00:30:10.057
- As in "Cavalleria Rusticana"?
- Right. No relation.

263
00:30:10.266 --> 00:30:12.685
- Hello, Mum.
- Hello, darling.

264
00:30:12.893 --> 00:30:15.605
Nice to meet you.
How are you, son?

265
00:30:17.064 --> 00:30:19.150
Fine, sir, fine.

266
00:30:20.276 --> 00:30:24.238
Please sit down
and make yourself at home.

267
00:30:37.084 --> 00:30:39.170
We'll have to go soon.

268
00:30:40.421 --> 00:30:44.050
Why are you so uncomfortable
with your parents?

269
00:30:44.258 --> 00:30:49.055
- Why did you want to leave at once?
- I didn't like how they treated you.

270
00:30:49.263 --> 00:30:51.557
"What is it your parents are in?"

271
00:30:51.766 --> 00:30:55.519
- What is it your people are in?
- My father bakes cookies.

272
00:30:55.728 --> 00:30:59.690
- What's the name of the firm?
- Phil's Bake Shop.

273
00:30:59.899 --> 00:31:04.278
- Of Cranston, Rhode Island.
- How interesting...

274
00:31:04.487 --> 00:31:09.617
- So your people are from Cranston?
- Mostly. My mother is from Fall River.

275
00:31:09.825 --> 00:31:15.039
- The Barretts have mills in Fall River.
- Where they exploited the poor.

276
00:31:15.247 --> 00:31:17.333
In the 19th century.

277
00:31:17.541 --> 00:31:21.378
When you inherit,
you can give all our money back.

278
00:31:22.213 --> 00:31:25.132
That's what the philosopher
Saint-Simon advocated.

279
00:31:25.341 --> 00:31:27.426
In the 18th century.

280
00:31:30.679 --> 00:31:33.891
- It's late.
- Aren't you staying for dinner?

281
00:31:34.225 --> 00:31:36.602
- Yes.
- No. I have to get back.

282
00:31:36.936 --> 00:31:39.939
You're staying for dinner
and that's an order.

283
00:31:40.272 --> 00:31:43.818
Everything is an order,
a directive, a command.

284
00:31:44.026 --> 00:31:46.612
Where is your sense of humour?

285
00:31:46.821 --> 00:31:49.865
In school, he used to send me memos.

286
00:31:50.074 --> 00:31:52.868
Memos! Don't you find that odd?

287
00:31:53.077 --> 00:31:55.788
I find it rather cute.

288
00:31:57.873 --> 00:32:01.418
Have you heard from Law School?

289
00:32:01.627 --> 00:32:05.172
- Not yet.
- He'll get in. Who's better than Oliver?

290
00:32:05.381 --> 00:32:08.509
I agree. He'll graduate with honours.

291
00:32:08.843 --> 00:32:12.596
He's always done well in school.
At Exeter, he was...

292
00:32:12.805 --> 00:32:17.601
It doesn't mean a thing.
I'm just one of many trying to get in.

293
00:32:19.144 --> 00:32:24.275
- I could give Price Zimmermann a ring.
- No! I mean, please don't, sir.

294
00:32:24.483 --> 00:32:26.861
Just to find out if he knows.

295
00:32:27.069 --> 00:32:31.448
I want to get my letter
with everyone else. Please.

296
00:32:33.659 --> 00:32:39.707
- He was only trying to be helpful.
- I don't need that kind of help.

297
00:32:39.915 --> 00:32:42.710
- OK.
- No, it's not OK.

298
00:32:42.918 --> 00:32:47.923
He's not going to be satisfied
until he cuts them off.

299
00:32:48.132 --> 00:32:50.968
What you wouldn't like to be cut off.

300
00:32:51.802 --> 00:32:55.848
Oh... Well, we've got
to take care of those.

301
00:32:56.056 --> 00:33:01.812
- Take care.
- Get there a minute later, but get there.

302
00:33:07.735 --> 00:33:12.865
- You really like to bug your father.
- The feeling is mutual.

303
00:33:13.073 --> 00:33:16.619
You wouldn't stop at anything
to get to him.

304
00:33:16.827 --> 00:33:20.456
It's impossible to get to Oliver Barrett lll.

305
00:33:21.624 --> 00:33:26.295
Unless maybe if you marry
Jennifer Cavilleri?

306
00:33:32.468 --> 00:33:36.096
- Is that what you think?
- Yes, it's part of it.

307
00:33:37.681 --> 00:33:40.267
You don't believe I love you?

308
00:33:40.476 --> 00:33:45.064
Yes, but you also love
my negative social status.

309
00:33:45.272 --> 00:33:47.066
No.

310
00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:51.445
I can't pass judgement.
I just think so.

311
00:33:51.654 --> 00:33:57.993
I love not only you,
but also your name and your numeral.

312
00:33:58.202 --> 00:34:01.955
After all, it's part of what you are.

313
00:34:02.164 --> 00:34:05.084
- Oh, how can you do it?
- What?

314
00:34:07.378 --> 00:34:10.422
How can you see me
and still love me?

315
00:34:10.631 --> 00:34:13.634
That's what it's about, preppy.

316
00:34:43.372 --> 00:34:47.417
- How are you, son?
- I'm OK, sir.

317
00:34:47.626 --> 00:34:50.671
Did you hear from Law School?

318
00:34:50.879 --> 00:34:55.342
- Yes. I called you, remember?
- Yes. Congratulations.

319
00:34:55.551 --> 00:35:00.139
- You'll be on the Supreme Court.
- I may just chase ambulances.

320
00:35:00.347 --> 00:35:03.183
Fine. How's Raymond?

321
00:35:03.392 --> 00:35:05.978
He's fine. Got into OCS.

322
00:35:06.186 --> 00:35:09.314
Army? That's good.

323
00:35:09.523 --> 00:35:12.025
That's bad.

324
00:35:14.027 --> 00:35:16.822
You haven't mentioned Jennifer.

325
00:35:17.030 --> 00:35:21.535
What is there to say? You're
presenting us with a fait accompli.

326
00:35:21.743 --> 00:35:26.206
- But what did you think?
- She's absolutely charming.

327
00:35:26.415 --> 00:35:29.960
With her background,
to get to Radcliffe is...

328
00:35:30.294 --> 00:35:35.507
- Get to the point!
- It doesn't concern her, but you.

329
00:35:35.716 --> 00:35:38.844
Your rebellion. And you are rebelling.

330
00:35:39.052 --> 00:35:41.013
I fail...

331
00:35:41.972 --> 00:35:48.103
I fail to see how marrying a brilliant
Radcliffe girl constitutes rebellion.

332
00:35:48.437 --> 00:35:51.356
She's not some crazy hippie.

333
00:35:51.565 --> 00:35:54.359
She's not many things.

334
00:35:54.693 --> 00:35:58.238
What irks you most,
that she's Catholic or poor?

335
00:35:58.447 --> 00:36:01.658
- What attracts you most?
- I'm leaving.

336
00:36:01.867 --> 00:36:08.874
Don't go off half-cocked.
I would only ask that you wait a bit.

337
00:36:09.082 --> 00:36:11.043
Define "bit".

338
00:36:11.251 --> 00:36:15.213
Finish Law School.
If it's real, it'll stand the test of time.

339
00:36:15.422 --> 00:36:18.675
It is real,
but why should I put it through a test?

340
00:36:18.884 --> 00:36:22.429
- I'm asking you.
- You're commanding me!

341
00:36:22.638 --> 00:36:27.935
If you marry her now,
I'll not give you the time of day.

342
00:36:29.394 --> 00:36:32.522
Father, you don't know the time of day!

343
00:36:57.339 --> 00:37:01.218
We're looking forward
to having you with us.

344
00:37:01.426 --> 00:37:04.137
Me too, Dean Thompson.

345
00:37:04.763 --> 00:37:07.974
- Something has come up.
- A change of heart?

346
00:37:08.183 --> 00:37:12.062
No, I'm still set on Law School, but...

347
00:37:12.771 --> 00:37:15.691
I'm going to need a scholarship.

348
00:37:16.650 --> 00:37:19.861
- Really?
- That's why I'm here.

349
00:37:20.821 --> 00:37:25.075
That's rather curious,
considering your background.

350
00:37:26.660 --> 00:37:30.288
- I'm not his son anymore.
- I beg your pardon?

351
00:37:32.791 --> 00:37:38.213
We have had a misunderstanding.
It's a parting of the ways.

352
00:37:40.215 --> 00:37:45.929
- This is very unfortunate, Mr Barrett.
- I'm not exactly jumping for joy.

353
00:37:46.138 --> 00:37:50.851
We have many entering students
in far worse straits than you.

354
00:37:51.059 --> 00:37:56.273
What's worse than destitution?
I'm getting married next month.

355
00:37:56.481 --> 00:38:03.029
We'll work all summer, and then
Jenny will teach in a private school.

356
00:38:03.238 --> 00:38:07.617
That's a living, but not tuition.
Your tuition is pretty steep.

357
00:38:07.826 --> 00:38:10.036
Yes.

358
00:38:11.580 --> 00:38:15.667
I need a scholarship.
I have already been accepted.

359
00:38:15.876 --> 00:38:20.338
- I don't have any money.
- You have a millionaire father.

360
00:38:20.547 --> 00:38:26.178
Had. Why should I be penalised just
because I was related to a rich man?

361
00:38:26.386 --> 00:38:34.227
Mr Barrett, I don't think that this office
should enter into a family quarrel.

362
00:38:34.436 --> 00:38:39.733
- A rather distressing one, at that.
- I see. Thank you.

363
00:38:41.818 --> 00:38:45.363
Perhaps at mid-year's.

364
00:38:47.574 --> 00:38:51.620
Thank you. You've been
very generous with your time.

365
00:38:57.375 --> 00:39:02.380
- We just passed my junior high school.
- I can't believe he liked my poverty.

366
00:39:02.589 --> 00:39:06.134
He did! Now you've got
something in common.

367
00:39:06.343 --> 00:39:09.554
God, when I first told him
Oliver Barrett...

368
00:39:09.763 --> 00:39:13.516
- Yeah?
- He couldn't believe it.

369
00:39:13.850 --> 00:39:16.436
He reminded me
of the Eleventh Commandment.

370
00:39:16.770 --> 00:39:20.732
- Eleventh?
- "Do not bullshit thy father."

371
00:39:20.941 --> 00:39:23.944
Any other commandments
I should know?

372
00:39:24.152 --> 00:39:26.237
Yeah. "Stay loose."

373
00:39:47.008 --> 00:39:51.596
- So is he for it? Does he approve?
- What do you think?

374
00:39:51.805 --> 00:39:56.393
- I won't allow it, do you get me?
- You're tilting at windmills, Phil.

375
00:39:56.601 --> 00:40:01.690
Stop calling his father a windmill.
He's a distinguished citizen...

376
00:40:01.898 --> 00:40:03.900
- Mr Cavilleri...
- Phil.

377
00:40:04.109 --> 00:40:08.988
- I'll call his goddamn father.
- It won't do any good, goddammit!

378
00:40:09.197 --> 00:40:12.325
- Don't use profanity in this house.
- You do.

379
00:40:12.659 --> 00:40:15.453
- What will he think?
- That you've gone mad.

380
00:40:15.787 --> 00:40:18.998
Because I won't allow a parent
to reject a child?

381
00:40:19.207 --> 00:40:22.043
- Mr Cavilleri...
- Phil.

382
00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:27.048
Phil, sir... I reject him, too!

383
00:40:27.257 --> 00:40:32.470
Don't talk like that. A father's love
is something to cherish and respect.

384
00:40:32.679 --> 00:40:36.099
- It's a rare thing.
- Especially in my family.

385
00:40:36.307 --> 00:40:40.270
- Let's get him on the phone.
- We have this cold line.

386
00:40:40.603 --> 00:40:46.317
He'll thaw and melt. Believe me,
when it's time to go to church...

387
00:40:46.526 --> 00:40:49.362
Let's get him on the phone.

388
00:40:49.571 --> 00:40:51.656
- Please, Phil.
- What?

389
00:40:52.907 --> 00:40:55.493
About the church bit...

390
00:40:55.827 --> 00:40:58.830
Well, we're kind of negative on it.

391
00:41:01.875 --> 00:41:06.045
I didn't necessarily mean
the Catholic Church.

392
00:41:10.008 --> 00:41:14.888
You know that Jennifer is Catholic?
She may have told you that.

393
00:41:15.096 --> 00:41:20.310
And her sainted mother
always dreamed of

394
00:41:20.518 --> 00:41:23.771
the whole mass rigmarole,
but you're...

395
00:41:25.940 --> 00:41:28.860
But God would bless this union
in any church.

396
00:41:29.194 --> 00:41:31.905
- Phil?
- Yeah?

397
00:41:32.113 --> 00:41:34.616
- About the God bit.
- Yeah?

398
00:41:34.824 --> 00:41:39.412
- We're sort of negative about that, too.
- About God?

399
00:41:41.789 --> 00:41:46.711
- About anybody's God?
- Neither of us believe.

400
00:41:47.962 --> 00:41:50.882
And we won't be hypocrites.

401
00:41:51.090 --> 00:41:57.222
If that's what you wish.
Just tell me who performs the wedding.

402
00:41:58.598 --> 00:42:00.683
We do.

403
00:42:03.394 --> 00:42:06.606
You mean to do it yourself?

404
00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:13.488
That's...wonderful.

405
00:42:17.367 --> 00:42:21.955
I mean, that's just...wonderful.

406
00:42:25.583 --> 00:42:30.505
Do it yourself, huh?
I think that's just wonderful.

407
00:42:31.422 --> 00:42:36.344
But, tell me, is it...?
What's the word?

408
00:42:36.552 --> 00:42:39.889
- You mean "legal"?
- Is it?

409
00:42:40.098 --> 00:42:45.103
Yes. One of the college chaplains
just sort of...

410
00:42:46.145 --> 00:42:50.525
He presides over it,
and the couple address each other.

411
00:42:50.733 --> 00:42:53.528
You mean the bride speaks, too?

412
00:42:56.447 --> 00:43:02.286
- It's a new world, Philip.
- Oh, yeah. It's new, all right.

413
00:43:16.467 --> 00:43:17.844
Ready?

414
00:43:18.052 --> 00:43:22.515
- Amen.
- They haven't started, yet.

415
00:43:22.849 --> 00:43:26.185
How will I know?
I've never been to a do-it-yourself.

416
00:43:26.394 --> 00:43:30.356
Listen to the words they have chosen
to read on this occasion.

417
00:43:30.565 --> 00:43:31.691
Amen.

418
00:43:32.942 --> 00:43:35.445
The priest said "sacred".

419
00:43:36.904 --> 00:43:40.450
- He's not a priest.
- He is to me.

420
00:43:51.210 --> 00:43:55.047
"When our two souls stand up
erect and strong

421
00:43:55.256 --> 00:43:59.844
"Face to face, silent,
drawing nigh and nigher

422
00:44:00.052 --> 00:44:04.015
"Until the lengthening wings
break into fire at either curved point,

423
00:44:04.223 --> 00:44:06.642
"What bitter wrong
can the earth do to us

424
00:44:06.851 --> 00:44:09.979
"That we should not
long be here contented?

425
00:44:10.188 --> 00:44:14.358
"Think! In mounting higher,
the angels would press on us

426
00:44:14.567 --> 00:44:17.987
"And aspire to drop some golden orb
of perfect song

427
00:44:18.196 --> 00:44:20.823
"Into our deep, dear silence

428
00:44:21.532 --> 00:44:24.452
"Let us stay rather on earth, Beloved,

429
00:44:24.660 --> 00:44:29.248
"Where the unfit contrarious
moods of men recoil away

430
00:44:29.582 --> 00:44:32.376
"And isolate pure spirits

431
00:44:32.585 --> 00:44:36.255
"And permit a place
to stand and love in for a day

432
00:44:36.464 --> 00:44:40.510
"With darkness and
the death-hour rounding it."

433
00:44:41.469 --> 00:44:44.180
"I give you my hand!

434
00:44:45.848 --> 00:44:50.728
"I give you my love
more precious than money

435
00:44:50.937 --> 00:44:55.525
"I give you myself
before preaching or law

436
00:44:55.858 --> 00:45:01.364
"Will you give me yourself?
Will you come travel with me?

437
00:45:03.449 --> 00:45:08.246
"Shall we stick by each other
as long as we live?"

438
00:45:12.333 --> 00:45:16.379
I, Oliver Barrett,
take you, Jennifer Cavilleri,

439
00:45:16.712 --> 00:45:20.049
to be my wedded wife
from this day forward...

440
00:45:22.551 --> 00:45:26.597
...to love and to cherish
till death do us part.

441
00:45:27.640 --> 00:45:31.602
I, Jennifer Cavilleri,
take you, Oliver Barrett,

442
00:45:31.936 --> 00:45:35.481
as my wedded husband
from this day forward,

443
00:45:35.690 --> 00:45:39.944
to love and to cherish
till death do us part.

444
00:45:52.873 --> 00:45:56.210
By the authority vested in me by
the Commonwealth of Massachusetts,

445
00:45:56.544 --> 00:45:59.672
I pronounce you man and wife.

446
00:46:04.260 --> 00:46:06.345
Now I'm being kept.

447
00:46:06.554 --> 00:46:08.848
- You won't like it.
- I already do.

448
00:46:09.056 --> 00:46:12.685
The school only pays me 3,000 a year.

449
00:46:12.893 --> 00:46:16.439
- Why?
- Because my name is Mrs Barrett.

450
00:46:16.647 --> 00:46:22.611
- Couldn't you be Miss Cavilleri?
- Then I'd be the Queen of Paris.

451
00:46:22.820 --> 00:46:24.780
It's a bargain.

452
00:46:25.114 --> 00:46:29.577
Four rooms for 82.50 a month
is impossible this side of Mongolia.

453
00:46:29.785 --> 00:46:33.330
But this is the Mongolian section
of Cambridge.

454
00:46:40.546 --> 00:46:42.298
Gee...

455
00:46:42.506 --> 00:46:47.636
I have to admit that
it's even worse than I expected.

456
00:46:47.845 --> 00:46:51.599
- Yeah, but it's home.
- Yeah.

457
00:46:51.807 --> 00:46:54.101
- Well?
- Well what?

458
00:46:54.310 --> 00:46:58.272
- Carry me over the threshold.
- Do you believe that nonsense?

459
00:46:58.481 --> 00:47:02.234
- Carry me and I'll tell you.
- We're at the top floor!

460
00:47:02.443 --> 00:47:05.780
OK, I'll be a young
and beautiful divorcee.

461
00:47:07.031 --> 00:47:09.950
Hey, what is this, Barrett?

462
00:47:10.159 --> 00:47:13.370
I'll tell you after we cross the threshold.

463
00:47:18.167 --> 00:47:21.212
- This is not a threshold.
- Our name is there.

464
00:47:21.420 --> 00:47:25.049
It's not an official threshold.
Upstairs, you preppy!

465
00:47:30.679 --> 00:47:34.016
- Why are you so heavy?
- I might be pregnant.

466
00:47:34.350 --> 00:47:36.936
- Are you?
- Scared you, didn't I?

467
00:47:37.144 --> 00:47:40.397
- No, I...
- Don't bullshit me.

468
00:47:40.606 --> 00:47:45.194
For a second I clutched.
Is this the official threshold?

469
00:47:45.402 --> 00:47:47.988
- What do think?
- If you don't say yes...

470
00:47:48.197 --> 00:47:50.282
Yes!

471
00:48:54.513 --> 00:48:56.932
- Where's Barrett?
- Where are the kids?

472
00:48:57.141 --> 00:49:02.646
Asleep, thank God. It's siesta time.
I've got 45 minutes.

473
00:49:02.855 --> 00:49:05.899
That's more than they give me.

474
00:49:16.327 --> 00:49:18.203
Damn it!

475
00:49:18.412 --> 00:49:21.832
- What's wrong with this engine?
- You're a Harvard Magna.

476
00:49:22.166 --> 00:49:25.377
- Not in mechanics.
- Welcome to the world, preppy.

477
00:49:25.586 --> 00:49:28.505
- Listen, Cavilleri...
- The name's Barrett, Barrett.

478
00:49:28.714 --> 00:49:31.759
Sometimes you are really a bitch.

479
00:49:39.475 --> 00:49:43.020
- How are they treating you?
- Fine, except for one brat.

480
00:49:43.228 --> 00:49:45.939
He'll be breaking and entering
before 10.

481
00:49:46.148 --> 00:49:49.777
- What now?
- He tried to pinch me.

482
00:49:49.985 --> 00:49:53.530
- I don't blame him.
- Next time, I'll wallop him.

483
00:49:53.739 --> 00:49:56.450
Not until you get his parents' tip.

484
00:49:59.703 --> 00:50:01.663
Damn it!

485
00:50:04.917 --> 00:50:07.836
- Let's get out of here.
- Don't touch me.

486
00:50:08.045 --> 00:50:13.342
- What a thing to say to your husband!
- Wash. You can touch me afterwards.

487
00:50:13.675 --> 00:50:18.680
I had another salary hassle today
with Miss Anne Miller Whitman.

488
00:50:18.889 --> 00:50:26.271
- I hope you laid it on thick this time.
- I told her I was proud to work for them.

489
00:50:26.480 --> 00:50:30.359
I said, "Even Barretts
have to pay their rent."

490
00:50:30.567 --> 00:50:33.987
- To which she retorted...
- "Ho, ho, ho!"

491
00:50:35.781 --> 00:50:40.577
- Define "Ho, ho, ho".
- 3,500 for the year.

492
00:50:40.786 --> 00:50:42.329
Ridiculous!

493
00:50:42.538 --> 00:50:47.751
Would you like to support me while l
take courses to teach in public school?

494
00:50:50.462 --> 00:50:54.216
- Would you please say something?
- Ho, ho, ho.

495
00:51:41.054 --> 00:51:45.225
- I thought you'd call after the meeting.
- I wanted you to study.

496
00:51:45.434 --> 00:51:48.020
- Have you eaten?
- I waited for you.

497
00:51:48.353 --> 00:51:51.064
- You're a growing boy.
- Not anymore.

498
00:51:51.273 --> 00:51:54.192
Yes, in the mind.
Did you check the mail?

499
00:51:54.401 --> 00:51:58.572
Just one second.
This is a crucial precedent.

500
00:52:06.079 --> 00:52:10.250
- Did you check the mail?
- No. Anything vital?

501
00:52:10.459 --> 00:52:14.296
- We are cordially invited...
- ...to pay the light bill.

502
00:52:14.629 --> 00:52:17.215
To a dinner.

503
00:52:17.424 --> 00:52:20.552
Your father's 60th birthday.

504
00:52:22.846 --> 00:52:25.140
- Did you hear me?
- Yes.

505
00:52:25.349 --> 00:52:28.060
RSVP.

506
00:52:28.268 --> 00:52:31.188
- You even have to ask?
- It's about time.

507
00:52:31.521 --> 00:52:33.482
- For what?
- You know.

508
00:52:33.690 --> 00:52:36.943
Does he have to crawl here?
He's reaching out.

509
00:52:37.152 --> 00:52:40.155
My mother addressed it.

510
00:52:40.364 --> 00:52:45.160
Think. 60 years old. Maybe he won't
be around for a reconciliation.

511
00:52:45.369 --> 00:52:47.371
There won't be one.

512
00:52:47.579 --> 00:52:50.999
- Oliver V will bug you...
- He won't be called that!

513
00:52:51.333 --> 00:52:56.004
He can be called Bozo. He'll still
resent you for being a Harvard jock!

514
00:52:56.213 --> 00:52:59.758
- You'll be on the Supreme Court...
- He won't resent me!

515
00:53:00.092 --> 00:53:02.052
- Why not?
- Because I...

516
00:53:02.260 --> 00:53:06.431
Your father loves you
like you'll love Bozo,

517
00:53:06.640 --> 00:53:11.561
but you Barretts are so proud that you'll
always think you hate each other.

518
00:53:11.770 --> 00:53:16.024
If it weren't for you?
The case is closed!

519
00:53:20.529 --> 00:53:26.159
- There's still the RSVP.
- I think you can handle it.

520
00:53:27.410 --> 00:53:31.665
I have never deliberately hurt anyone,
and I don't think I could.

521
00:53:31.873 --> 00:53:33.542
Jennifer!

522
00:53:34.501 --> 00:53:37.003
Just answer no.

523
00:53:38.046 --> 00:53:42.717
- OK. What's the number?
- Can't you write a note?

524
00:53:42.926 --> 00:53:45.846
I'll lose my nerve.
What's the number?

525
00:53:46.179 --> 00:53:50.225
338-3434, and dial 1 first.

526
00:54:06.700 --> 00:54:13.081
Good evening, this is Jennifer Barrett.
Mr Barrett! Good evening, sir.

527
00:54:13.290 --> 00:54:15.792
Fine, thank you.

528
00:54:16.001 --> 00:54:18.587
Yes, we did. That's why I'm calling.

529
00:54:18.795 --> 00:54:22.966
I'm terribly sorry,
I mean we're terribly sorry,

530
00:54:23.300 --> 00:54:25.886
but... no, we can't.

531
00:54:27.554 --> 00:54:29.639
I'm sorry.

532
00:54:30.891 --> 00:54:34.019
Oliver, please talk to him.
Just say hello.

533
00:54:35.395 --> 00:54:39.649
- I will never talk to him.
- Can't you do it for me?

534
00:54:39.858 --> 00:54:45.905
I've never asked you to do anything
in my whole life. Just for me.

535
00:54:46.114 --> 00:54:47.991
No.

536
00:54:50.910 --> 00:54:54.039
You're a heartless bastard.

537
00:54:55.206 --> 00:54:58.418
Mr Barrett?
Oliver would like you to know

538
00:54:58.752 --> 00:55:03.131
that in his own special way,
he loves you very much.

539
00:55:03.340 --> 00:55:06.676
Get the hell out of my life!

540
00:58:48.773 --> 00:58:51.484
I forgot my key.

541
00:58:52.735 --> 00:58:55.530
Jenny, I'm sorry.

542
00:58:56.572 --> 00:58:58.032
Don't.

543
00:58:58.991 --> 00:59:02.829
Love means
never having to say you're sorry.

544
01:02:10.516 --> 01:02:15.020
Concentrate on blending
and stop showing off your voice.

545
01:02:15.229 --> 01:02:17.732
But I wasn't!

546
01:02:18.983 --> 01:02:22.403
- No bullshit. You were showing off.
- Sorry, Jenny.

547
01:02:22.611 --> 01:02:27.324
One last time and this time
I want crisp diction.

548
01:03:13.496 --> 01:03:19.543
Wow! That was really
incredibly, absolutely...

549
01:03:20.586 --> 01:03:22.463
...not bad.

550
01:03:25.925 --> 01:03:31.347
- Tomorrow at 8.30, OK?
- OK. Bye, Jenny.

551
01:03:49.365 --> 01:03:52.493
Well, Barrett,
what brings you to church?

552
01:03:52.701 --> 01:03:55.829
The saloons closed early.

553
01:03:57.831 --> 01:04:00.542
Did you get us a tree?

554
01:04:01.585 --> 01:04:05.631
Don't worry about it.
We'll get one on the way home.

555
01:04:07.841 --> 01:04:10.844
What are you doing New Year's Eve?

556
01:04:11.887 --> 01:04:14.390
Sleeping.

557
01:04:18.686 --> 01:04:22.022
I thought you'd want
to spend it with me.

558
01:04:22.231 --> 01:04:24.942
What are you doing?

559
01:04:25.150 --> 01:04:27.653
Sleeping.

560
01:04:32.449 --> 01:04:36.078
Some day, we'll look back
on these days...

561
01:04:36.286 --> 01:04:39.832
The sooner, the better.

562
01:04:46.213 --> 01:04:47.464
Go!

563
01:04:53.387 --> 01:04:55.806
Jennifer, come here!

564
01:04:57.891 --> 01:05:00.602
Jennifer, come here!

565
01:05:00.811 --> 01:05:05.190
What? Come on!
Start it over again.

566
01:05:05.399 --> 01:05:09.028
- What is it?
- I have something important to tell you.

567
01:05:09.236 --> 01:05:14.241
- Couldn't you tell me over there?
- No, I want to be alone with you.

568
01:05:14.867 --> 01:05:17.369
Fantastic news. Here, read.

569
01:05:17.911 --> 01:05:21.665
Harvard Law School?
You got kicked out.

570
01:05:21.874 --> 01:05:24.585
Read it, will you?
It's great news.

571
01:05:24.793 --> 01:05:30.507
- You were first in the class?
- Not quite. Third.

572
01:05:30.841 --> 01:05:35.721
- Only third, huh?
- That means I make the Law Review.

573
01:05:38.348 --> 01:05:40.851
Say something, please.

574
01:05:41.059 --> 01:05:45.731
Not until I've met
numbers one and two.

575
01:05:58.243 --> 01:06:05.542
And the William DeJersey Memorial
Award for the finest senior essay to...

576
01:06:05.751 --> 01:06:08.670
...Oliver Barrett lV.

577
01:06:25.062 --> 01:06:27.147
- On your feet.
- How much?

578
01:06:27.356 --> 01:06:29.233
500 big ones!

579
01:06:29.441 --> 01:06:30.984
Holy shit!

580
01:06:31.318 --> 01:06:35.155
- Get up! Come on!
- Quiet!

581
01:06:39.326 --> 01:06:43.830
The Jennifer Barrett Maternity Award!

582
01:07:00.597 --> 01:07:04.977
- It was a good apartment for 80 bucks.
- Now our garage will cost that.

583
01:07:05.310 --> 01:07:09.356
- Why have a car in New York?
- House calls, Jenny.

584
01:07:09.690 --> 01:07:13.735
Lawyers for Jonas and Marsh
don't make house calls.

585
01:07:13.944 --> 01:07:18.031
- Yes, to Mr Jonas and Mr Marsh.
- You can walk there.

586
01:07:18.240 --> 01:07:21.785
- Rich people ride.
- Nouveau riche people.

587
01:07:21.994 --> 01:07:23.954
That's us.

588
01:07:24.162 --> 01:07:29.084
You won't laugh? I'm actually
getting to like the name Bozo.

589
01:07:29.293 --> 01:07:31.461
- For what?
- Our kid.

590
01:07:31.670 --> 01:07:34.298
Our huge and bruising All-Ivy tackle.

591
01:07:34.506 --> 01:07:38.468
- Bozo Barrett?
- It's the name of a Harvard superjock.

592
01:07:38.677 --> 01:07:43.056
You would actually call
our offspring Bozo?

593
01:07:43.265 --> 01:07:45.976
Only if it's a boy.

594
01:07:57.863 --> 01:08:01.283
- We have crossed the poverty line.
- Not quite.

595
01:08:01.616 --> 01:08:04.327
- What?
- Not until I'm carried over the threshold.

596
01:08:04.536 --> 01:08:08.790
- We've done that!
- Now you're a lawyer. lt'll be legal.

597
01:08:08.999 --> 01:08:12.252
- It's on the tenth floor!
- Carry me in the elevator.

598
01:08:12.461 --> 01:08:14.838
Thank God for that.

599
01:08:16.214 --> 01:08:19.634
- Can I help?
- Barrett. 10-H. The bags are in the car.

600
01:08:19.843 --> 01:08:23.722
- Is the lady all right?
- I will be when I'm over the threshold.

601
01:08:23.930 --> 01:08:26.850
- Newly-weds, huh?
- Eternally.

602
01:08:27.059 --> 01:08:28.810
Move your ass, preppy.

603
01:08:39.780 --> 01:08:44.034
You've got it made, you bastard.
Made in the shade.

604
01:08:46.661 --> 01:08:50.707
- Snug as a bug in a rug.
- Cut the crap and play.

605
01:08:51.041 --> 01:08:54.461
Working for Jonas and Marsh,
pulling in the coin...

606
01:08:54.669 --> 01:08:57.589
- Play, damn it!
- I can't help it.

607
01:09:00.717 --> 01:09:03.762
Married to "Foul Mouth Angelface".

608
01:09:03.970 --> 01:09:06.056
Pay attention.

609
01:09:06.264 --> 01:09:10.310
- Why should you have all the luck?
- It was a long drag.

610
01:09:10.644 --> 01:09:14.898
This is the first week
that Jenny hasn't had to work.

611
01:09:15.106 --> 01:09:20.237
- What is she going to do?
- I want her to study, she wants a baby.

612
01:09:20.445 --> 01:09:23.657
- So?
- So we're making babies.

613
01:09:25.951 --> 01:09:31.581
- Do you need any help, old buddy?
- I'll call you if I need you.

614
01:10:00.569 --> 01:10:06.616
- Whose fault is it?
- I wouldn't use the word "fault".

615
01:10:06.825 --> 01:10:09.536
OK, we'll put it your way.

616
01:10:11.538 --> 01:10:17.586
Two 24-year-olds can't make a baby.
One must be malfunctioning. Who?

617
01:10:17.794 --> 01:10:19.963
Jenny.

618
01:10:22.173 --> 01:10:24.884
All right, then we'll adopt kids.

619
01:10:25.093 --> 01:10:29.973
The problem is more serious.
Jenny is very sick.

620
01:10:32.892 --> 01:10:35.603
Define "very sick".

621
01:10:37.063 --> 01:10:39.899
She's dying.

622
01:10:45.113 --> 01:10:47.407
That's impossible.

623
01:10:48.325 --> 01:10:51.369
I'm sorry to have to tell you this.

624
01:10:52.704 --> 01:10:55.540
That's impossible.

625
01:10:56.583 --> 01:10:59.377
It's a mistake, it has to be.

626
01:10:59.586 --> 01:11:04.924
We repeated her blood test three times.
The diagnosis is correct.

627
01:11:05.967 --> 01:11:08.762
She'll have to be told soon.

628
01:11:08.970 --> 01:11:14.392
We can withhold treatment
for a little while, but not for long.

629
01:11:14.726 --> 01:11:19.606
We'll have to begin therapy
sometime during the next few weeks.

630
01:11:19.939 --> 01:11:22.525
She's only 24.

631
01:11:26.905 --> 01:11:30.033
- Will it be painful?
- Hopefully not.

632
01:11:30.241 --> 01:11:35.872
You'll want to talk to a haematologist.
I can refer you to Dr Addison.

633
01:11:37.332 --> 01:11:38.917
Yeah.

634
01:11:41.211 --> 01:11:44.631
What do I do?
What can I do for Jenny?

635
01:11:46.007 --> 01:11:50.595
Act as normal as possible,
for as long as possible.

636
01:11:52.263 --> 01:11:55.391
That's really the best thing.

637
01:11:57.268 --> 01:11:59.020
Normal.

638
01:12:00.396 --> 01:12:04.150
OK, I'll be as normal as hell.

639
01:13:33.072 --> 01:13:34.657
Jen?

640
01:13:37.160 --> 01:13:40.079
Jenny, I'm home.

641
01:13:40.288 --> 01:13:43.082
- I need a lawyer.
- I'm a lawyer.

642
01:13:43.291 --> 01:13:45.376
I need you.

643
01:13:45.710 --> 01:13:49.464
- I need you, too.
- Why? I'm not a lawyer.

644
01:13:49.672 --> 01:13:53.718
No, but you're a nut,
and I happen to need a nut.

645
01:13:54.677 --> 01:13:58.097
- You look lovely, Jenny.
- Bullshit.

646
01:13:58.306 --> 01:14:02.477
- OK, you look terrible.
- No, I never look terrible.

647
01:14:02.685 --> 01:14:07.273
- I look OK for Thursday evening, OK?
- There's no poetry in "OK".

648
01:14:07.607 --> 01:14:11.444
Screw poetry.
Just tell me what you see.

649
01:14:11.652 --> 01:14:15.198
- I see you.
- That's poetry.

650
01:14:15.406 --> 01:14:19.994
Did Dr Shapeley tell you
that we both checked out?

651
01:14:20.328 --> 01:14:21.579
Yeah.

652
01:14:21.788 --> 01:14:25.333
So we just have to keep trying, right?

653
01:14:26.584 --> 01:14:31.172
- Yeah, let's try now.
- At this very minute?

654
01:14:31.381 --> 01:14:33.758
Even sooner.

655
01:14:54.612 --> 01:14:55.988
Jenny?

656
01:15:00.243 --> 01:15:06.207
Get out there and support me in
the manner to which I'll be accustomed.

657
01:15:06.415 --> 01:15:08.084
Get up.

658
01:15:10.586 --> 01:15:13.714
- Are you meeting Stratton today?
- Who?

659
01:15:13.923 --> 01:15:19.011
Ray Stratton, your best friend.
Your roommate before me.

660
01:15:19.762 --> 01:15:25.059
- We're supposed to play, but I'll cancel.
- The hell you will!

661
01:15:25.268 --> 01:15:29.147
- Why not?
- I don't want a flabby husband.

662
01:15:29.355 --> 01:15:32.984
- All right, but I'll take you out to dinner.
- Why?

663
01:15:33.317 --> 01:15:36.529
Can't I take my wife
to dinner if I want to?

664
01:15:36.863 --> 01:15:41.659
- OK, Barrett, what's her name?
- What?

665
01:15:41.868 --> 01:15:47.373
If you take your wife out in the middle
of the week, you're screwing somebody.

666
01:16:04.599 --> 01:16:06.893
- What's the matter?
- Off day.

667
01:16:07.101 --> 01:16:11.063
You've had an off day
for two weeks now.

668
01:16:11.689 --> 01:16:15.860
Jonas wants me to go to Chicago
on a big case.

669
01:16:16.903 --> 01:16:19.906
That newscaster
that got beat up by the cops.

670
01:16:20.239 --> 01:16:23.659
Fantastic. You on the other side
of a punch-out rap.

671
01:16:23.993 --> 01:16:26.704
- I turned him down.
- Why?

672
01:16:26.913 --> 01:16:30.333
I couldn't see living in some hotel.

673
01:16:30.666 --> 01:16:33.586
Boy, you're really married!

674
01:16:35.463 --> 01:16:38.257
Your time will come.

675
01:17:38.025 --> 01:17:39.693
Mrs Barrett!

676
01:17:39.902 --> 01:17:42.613
I'm in the kitchen where I belong.
Come here.

677
01:17:42.822 --> 01:17:45.741
- Guess what.
- You got fired.

678
01:17:45.950 --> 01:17:50.413
- I got fired up. Guess where to.
- Reno, Nevada.

679
01:17:50.621 --> 01:17:54.083
Paris, France.
We'll be there Christmas Day.

680
01:17:55.626 --> 01:17:58.879
No, that's not the way we'll do it.

681
01:17:59.088 --> 01:18:03.467
- Do what?
- I don't want Paris, I don't need Paris.

682
01:18:03.676 --> 01:18:07.847
- I just want you.
- That you got, baby.

683
01:18:09.723 --> 01:18:14.395
And I want time,
which you can't give me.

684
01:18:19.316 --> 01:18:20.860
You saw Dr Shapeley?

685
01:18:23.070 --> 01:18:26.490
And his buddy, too.
He's a very nice guy.

686
01:18:29.118 --> 01:18:31.829
- Good. Who?
- Dr Addison.

687
01:18:32.037 --> 01:18:36.917
He's a Yalie, college and med school.
But I said you wouldn't mind.

688
01:18:39.128 --> 01:18:41.422
Not if he's nice.

689
01:18:41.630 --> 01:18:46.927
He didn't bullshit me,
and that's what I wanted.

690
01:18:49.138 --> 01:18:53.601
- OK, then for the Yalie doctor.
- OK.

691
01:19:06.030 --> 01:19:11.452
I'm counting on you to be strong,
you goddamn hockey jock.

692
01:19:11.660 --> 01:19:14.455
I will, baby. I will.

693
01:19:17.583 --> 01:19:21.045
It will be hardest for Phil.

694
01:19:22.713 --> 01:19:26.675
You, after all, are going to be
the merry widower.

695
01:19:29.595 --> 01:19:35.309
- I won't be merry.
- Yes, you will. I want you to be merry.

696
01:19:35.643 --> 01:19:38.646
You'll be merry, OK?

697
01:19:40.522 --> 01:19:41.774
OK.

698
01:19:43.567 --> 01:19:45.319
OK.

699
01:21:16.785 --> 01:21:20.831
- Enough?
- No. I love watching you.

700
01:21:21.165 --> 01:21:26.879
- The old hockey fake-out.
- That's you, the old hockey fake-out.

701
01:21:27.087 --> 01:21:30.841
- Can we get hot chocolate?
- Sure, I'll even pay.

702
01:21:31.049 --> 01:21:37.097
- Very gracious of you.
- I liked it best when I supported you.

703
01:21:37.431 --> 01:21:42.519
You always supported me.
After all, what's money?

704
01:21:42.728 --> 01:21:45.022
I don't know.

705
01:21:52.446 --> 01:21:57.951
- Could we afford a taxi?
- Sure. Where do you want to go?

706
01:21:58.160 --> 01:22:00.454
The hospital.

707
01:23:29.835 --> 01:23:34.923
She's getting white cells and platelets,
which she needs most.

708
01:23:35.132 --> 01:23:38.885
- She doesn't want antimetabolites.
- What's that?

709
01:23:39.219 --> 01:23:44.933
A treatment that slows cell destruction.
But there are unpleasant side effects.

710
01:23:45.142 --> 01:23:47.978
Jenny's the boss.
Whatever she wants.

711
01:23:48.186 --> 01:23:52.566
Do everything you can
to make sure it doesn't hurt.

712
01:23:52.774 --> 01:23:55.986
- We will.
- I don't care what it costs.

713
01:23:56.194 --> 01:23:59.322
- It could take months.
- Screw the cost.

714
01:23:59.531 --> 01:24:03.910
There's no way of knowing
how long she'll linger.

715
01:24:04.119 --> 01:24:07.164
I want her to have the very best.

716
01:24:07.372 --> 01:24:12.878
I'm wealthy. I'm rich.
Really, I'm like a millionaire.

717
01:24:52.709 --> 01:24:55.629
- How have you been?
- Fine, sir.

718
01:24:55.962 --> 01:25:00.342
- And how is Jennifer?
- She's fine, sir.

719
01:25:04.387 --> 01:25:08.350
I need to borrow 5,000 dollars
for a very good reason.

720
01:25:13.563 --> 01:25:15.565
Well?

721
01:25:16.608 --> 01:25:20.028
- Sir?
- May I know the reason?

722
01:25:21.404 --> 01:25:25.450
I can't tell you.
Just lend me the money, please.

723
01:25:25.784 --> 01:25:28.995
- Don't they pay you at the firm?
- Yes, sir.

724
01:25:29.204 --> 01:25:32.958
- And doesn't she teach...
- Don't call her "she".

725
01:25:34.334 --> 01:25:37.045
- Doesn't Jennifer...
- Leave her out of it.

726
01:25:37.254 --> 01:25:43.385
Just write out a cheque.
It's a very important personal matter.

727
01:25:43.593 --> 01:25:46.721
You got some girl in trouble?

728
01:25:48.306 --> 01:25:50.892
Yeah, that's it.

729
01:25:56.731 --> 01:25:59.651
Please lend me the money.

730
01:26:41.776 --> 01:26:44.404
Thank you, Father.

731
01:27:51.012 --> 01:27:52.597
How is she?

732
01:27:52.805 --> 01:27:55.099
She wants the troops home
for Christmas.

733
01:27:55.308 --> 01:27:59.771
- Always running the show.
- She may succeed.

734
01:27:59.979 --> 01:28:02.899
- That fast?
- Yes.

735
01:28:21.459 --> 01:28:23.670
Hello, baby.

736
01:28:23.878 --> 01:28:25.421
Phil.

737
01:28:25.755 --> 01:28:28.550
How is it going, Mrs B?

738
01:28:28.883 --> 01:28:32.720
It's going, preppy.
The troops will be home for Christmas.

739
01:28:33.054 --> 01:28:37.016
- That's a little trite.
- It's the goddamn truth.

740
01:28:37.225 --> 01:28:41.479
Watch your language.
There's a grown-up present.

741
01:28:41.688 --> 01:28:45.358
I hope so. Phil made a few promises.

742
01:28:45.566 --> 01:28:47.652
Don't worry, Jenny.

743
01:28:50.363 --> 01:28:53.283
Maybe I ought to let you guys...

744
01:28:53.491 --> 01:28:55.785
I'll be nearby.

745
01:29:05.795 --> 01:29:08.381
It doesn't hurt, Ollie.

746
01:29:09.966 --> 01:29:13.386
It's like falling off a cliff in slow motion.

747
01:29:15.388 --> 01:29:20.268
Only after a while you wish you'd hit
the ground already, you know?

748
01:29:20.601 --> 01:29:22.145
Yeah.

749
01:29:22.353 --> 01:29:25.064
Bullshit. You've never fallen off a cliff.

750
01:29:26.524 --> 01:29:29.861
Yes, I did. When I met you.

751
01:29:32.071 --> 01:29:33.948
Yeah.

752
01:29:34.157 --> 01:29:37.076
"What a falling off was there."

753
01:29:38.119 --> 01:29:41.247
- Who said that?
- I don't know. Shakespeare?

754
01:29:41.456 --> 01:29:44.167
Yeah, but who?

755
01:29:45.209 --> 01:29:47.712
I mean, what play?

756
01:29:47.920 --> 01:29:52.717
I went to Radcliffe, I'm supposed
to remember those things.

757
01:29:56.679 --> 01:30:01.059
I once knew all
the Mozart Kochel listings.

758
01:30:01.267 --> 01:30:04.270
- Big deal.
- You bet it was.

759
01:30:06.898 --> 01:30:10.109
What number is
the A Major Concerto?

760
01:30:11.903 --> 01:30:17.617
- I don't know. I'll look it up.
- But I used to know all those things.

761
01:30:20.244 --> 01:30:25.875
- Do you want to talk music?
- What do you want to talk? Funerals?

762
01:30:28.044 --> 01:30:30.671
No, I don't.

763
01:30:37.345 --> 01:30:38.679
Ollie?

764
01:30:40.348 --> 01:30:44.519
I told Phil you could have
a Catholic service

765
01:30:44.727 --> 01:30:48.481
and you'd say OK. OK?

766
01:30:50.900 --> 01:30:54.320
It'll really help him a lot, you know?

767
01:30:57.573 --> 01:30:59.325
OK.

768
01:31:01.744 --> 01:31:04.664
Now you've got to stop being sick.

769
01:31:05.373 --> 01:31:07.792
Me?

770
01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:11.546
That guilty look on your face,
it's sick.

771
01:31:18.511 --> 01:31:23.516
Stop blaming yourself,
you stupid preppy. It's nobody's fault.

772
01:31:29.897 --> 01:31:32.608
It's not your fault.

773
01:31:38.447 --> 01:31:43.536
That's the only thing I'll ask you.
Otherwise, you'll be OK.

774
01:32:00.136 --> 01:32:02.430
Screw Paris!

775
01:32:05.558 --> 01:32:07.935
What?

776
01:32:08.269 --> 01:32:13.774
Screw Paris and music and everything
you thought you stole from me.

777
01:32:13.983 --> 01:32:17.320
I don't care, don't you believe that?

778
01:32:27.538 --> 01:32:32.752
Then get the hell out of here!
I don't want you at my deathbed!

779
01:32:37.048 --> 01:32:39.550
I believe you.

780
01:32:39.759 --> 01:32:42.136
I really do.

781
01:32:44.430 --> 01:32:46.932
That's better.

782
01:32:51.228 --> 01:32:55.066
Would you please
do something for me?

783
01:33:00.196 --> 01:33:02.698
Would you please hold me?

784
01:33:14.668 --> 01:33:19.256
I mean really hold me. Next to me.

785
01:34:31.745 --> 01:34:33.622
Philip?

786
01:34:45.718 --> 01:34:48.095
I wish...

787
01:34:52.474 --> 01:34:56.437
I wish I hadn't promised Jenny...

788
01:35:01.650 --> 01:35:06.655
I wish I hadn't promised Jenny
to be strong for you.

789
01:35:49.198 --> 01:35:50.574
Oliver.

790
01:35:51.909 --> 01:35:54.328
Why didn't you tell me?

791
01:35:54.536 --> 01:35:59.208
I made some calls, and when I found out
I jumped in the car.

792
01:35:59.416 --> 01:36:02.127
Oliver, I want to help.

793
01:36:03.170 --> 01:36:06.090
Jenny's dead.

794
01:36:07.883 --> 01:36:10.677
- I'm sorry.
- Love...

795
01:36:11.845 --> 01:36:15.474
Love means
never having to say you're sorry.

796
