1
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,880
Swannie.

2
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,640
Come over here.

3
00:01:58,559 --> 00:02:00,759
Come to me.

4
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:06,079
Nice, Swan.

5
00:02:10,677 --> 00:02:12,517
Come on.

6
00:02:12,517 --> 00:02:15,156
Come to me, Mr. Swan.

7
00:02:15,156 --> 00:02:18,076
You'll frighten it!

8
00:02:21,395 --> 00:02:23,754
Help!

9
00:02:25,754 --> 00:02:27,953
Help!

10
00:02:28,353 --> 00:02:30,752
Go get my parents.
Go!

11
00:02:52,028 --> 00:02:53,628
I've killed him.

12
00:02:53,628 --> 00:02:56,828
I've killed him.

13
00:02:57,387 --> 00:02:59,027
I kill...

14
00:02:59,027 --> 00:03:01,506
Ohh.

15
00:03:04,146 --> 00:03:07,145
Ohh.

16
00:03:09,864 --> 00:03:11,864
Nathan!

17
00:03:14,983 --> 00:03:16,703
Oh Jesus.

18
00:03:16,703 --> 00:03:17,982
- Where's Claire?
- Call 911!

19
00:03:17,982 --> 00:03:20,102
- I don't know what happened!
- Where is she?

20
00:03:20,102 --> 00:03:23,462
- He came out of nowhere!
- Nathan...

21
00:03:23,462 --> 00:03:26,421
Do you think he can hear me?

22
00:03:26,661 --> 00:03:28,620
Where's Claire?

23
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:30,179
Where is she?

24
00:03:30,179 --> 00:03:32,620
I'll look for her later!

25
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:15,450
I was dead.

26
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:18,170
I mean,

27
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:20,250
I was really dead.

28
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:22,729
Really.

29
00:04:24,769 --> 00:04:26,129
Tell me about it.

30
00:04:26,129 --> 00:04:27,688
What's it like to be dead?

31
00:04:30,608 --> 00:04:33,286
I'd got loose.

32
00:04:34,287 --> 00:04:38,606
It were as if I was
getting out of my body.

33
00:04:39,325 --> 00:04:42,805
My body was staying here,
and I...

34
00:04:42,805 --> 00:04:45,325
I was flying.

35
00:04:46,563 --> 00:04:48,763
You were floating?

36
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:51,523
Yes.

37
00:04:51,523 --> 00:04:54,122
I heard that dog,
and a woman screaming.

38
00:04:54,122 --> 00:04:56,881
They were around me,
panicking and...

39
00:04:56,881 --> 00:04:59,920
then I heard that noise.

40
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,280
It was like a whistle.

41
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:05,920
A very, very loud whistle.

42
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,839
I saw... a light.

43
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:10,919
A light?

44
00:05:12,719 --> 00:05:15,119
Yes.

45
00:05:15,918 --> 00:05:18,077
It was alive.

46
00:05:18,077 --> 00:05:22,196
It was alive
as if it were waiting for me.

47
00:05:22,717 --> 00:05:25,156
I was in the light.

48
00:05:25,156 --> 00:05:26,995
I felt good.

49
00:05:26,995 --> 00:05:30,035
- Didn't you want to come back?
- No.

50
00:05:30,035 --> 00:05:32,314
But you did come back.

51
00:05:32,314 --> 00:05:34,353
Yes.

52
00:05:35,193 --> 00:05:37,273
Why did you come back?

53
00:05:39,073 --> 00:05:41,192
I just did.

54
00:05:41,192 --> 00:05:43,752
Something made you come back.

55
00:05:43,752 --> 00:05:46,911
Is there something you're holding back?

56
00:05:48,391 --> 00:05:51,550
Yes.

57
00:05:52,069 --> 00:05:54,150
Hey, would you like
to hear about Jesus Christ?

58
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:56,910
Here you go.

59
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:03,268
Would you like to hear

60
00:06:03,268 --> 00:06:05,828
Excuse me, would you like to hear
about Jesus Christ today?

61
00:06:05,828 --> 00:06:07,107
Like to hear about Jesus Christ?

62
00:06:07,107 --> 00:06:08,466
- Okay.
- Thank you very much, sir.

63
00:06:08,466 --> 00:06:10,106
Would you like to hear
about Jesus Christ? Have a great day.

64
00:06:10,106 --> 00:06:13,905
Would you like to hear
about Jesus Christ today?

65
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:40,540
But what made him come back?

66
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:43,939
Won't you answer?

67
00:06:44,219 --> 00:06:46,739
Nathan?

68
00:06:50,778 --> 00:06:53,618
...right turn.

69
00:06:54,897 --> 00:06:56,176
It doesn't recover.

70
00:06:58,296 --> 00:07:01,016
We're dropping the...

71
00:07:01,935 --> 00:07:04,774
Speed, 220 knots.

72
00:07:05,775 --> 00:07:08,694
Wings lowered.

73
00:07:09,693 --> 00:07:11,813
Flap up.
Flap up! Flap up!

74
00:07:11,813 --> 00:07:13,852
Power! Power!

75
00:07:13,852 --> 00:07:15,852
Oh, shit!

76
00:07:17,332 --> 00:07:20,051
No!

77
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:33,609
Of the 45 passengers on board,

78
00:07:33,609 --> 00:07:36,168
nine belonged
to the same family.

79
00:07:36,168 --> 00:07:38,048
All from Haiti.

80
00:07:38,408 --> 00:07:39,968
So?

81
00:07:39,968 --> 00:07:42,687
So they're afraid of getting
fucked over by the Warsaw Convention.

82
00:07:42,687 --> 00:07:44,566
I explained to them
that doesn't exist here,

83
00:07:44,566 --> 00:07:46,166
but they're scared,
even still.

84
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:47,686
They set up a committee.

85
00:07:47,686 --> 00:07:49,285
I met their spokesman.

86
00:07:49,285 --> 00:07:50,885
They gave me this.

87
00:07:50,885 --> 00:07:52,484
What does the NTSB say about this?

88
00:07:52,484 --> 00:07:53,724
The NTSB isn't getting involved.

89
00:07:53,724 --> 00:07:55,204
Neither is the FAA.

90
00:07:55,204 --> 00:07:56,963
They've all washed their
hands of it.

91
00:07:56,963 --> 00:07:58,963
The airline is registered
in the Virgin Islands,

92
00:07:58,963 --> 00:08:00,483
the tour operator in the Caymans.

93
00:08:00,483 --> 00:08:02,402
The crew is from Russia.
They still don't know...

94
00:08:02,402 --> 00:08:04,801
if the plane crashed in Haiti
or the Dominican Republic.

95
00:08:04,801 --> 00:08:06,241
Every day it's a different story.

96
00:08:06,241 --> 00:08:08,721
But the plane was due
to land here in the US?

97
00:08:08,721 --> 00:08:09,961
Seems like everyone forgot that.

98
00:08:09,961 --> 00:08:12,280
The FAA isn't going
to go poking its nose in.

99
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:15,920
Too much work, too much hassle,
too much everything.

100
00:08:20,119 --> 00:08:21,359
Nathan?

101
00:08:21,359 --> 00:08:24,398
I don't like the smell of it.

102
00:08:24,398 --> 00:08:26,078
If the FAA won't get involved,

103
00:08:26,078 --> 00:08:28,637
that means a lawsuit like this
could drag on for years.

104
00:08:28,637 --> 00:08:30,837
That means hundreds
of thousands of dollars.

105
00:08:30,837 --> 00:08:33,756
And it means we can forget
about the Hague Protocol.

106
00:08:33,756 --> 00:08:35,835
I don't like it.

107
00:08:35,835 --> 00:08:37,795
Excuse me,

108
00:08:37,795 --> 00:08:40,795
since when are we afraid of cases
that drag on for years?

109
00:08:40,795 --> 00:08:42,874
These people are going
to get fucked over

110
00:08:42,874 --> 00:08:44,393
on the pretext that no convention...

111
00:08:44,393 --> 00:08:47,193
It was the same shit in Unterlinguen.

112
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:48,633
In Kinshasa too.

113
00:08:48,633 --> 00:08:51,752
A judge will show up
with his calculator and say what?

114
00:08:51,752 --> 00:08:53,992
"All right, let's imagine
some two-year-old kid

115
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:55,551
"who has lost his mother.

116
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,830
"We'll say she'd have devoted

117
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:59,510
how much of her time
to him, per day?"

118
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:01,591
- Michael?
- Three hours, tops.

119
00:09:01,591 --> 00:09:04,430
That's a good mother.

120
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:06,989
Up until the age of 18,

121
00:09:06,989 --> 00:09:11,468
which gives us three hours
a day, times 365 days,

122
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:13,748
times $8 an hour,

123
00:09:13,748 --> 00:09:15,547
plus the usual interest...

124
00:09:15,547 --> 00:09:17,907
that totals a little less

125
00:09:17,907 --> 00:09:19,826
than $100,000 at best.

126
00:09:19,826 --> 00:09:22,065
- And the plane wasn't even full.
- See?

127
00:09:22,065 --> 00:09:23,826
How far will that get you?

128
00:09:23,826 --> 00:09:27,265
You can't even take your mistress
on a weekend trip.

129
00:09:27,265 --> 00:09:28,305
Nothing.

130
00:09:28,305 --> 00:09:31,704
All right, fine.
But tomorrow morning,

131
00:09:31,704 --> 00:09:33,863
these people are going
to be in my office.

132
00:09:33,863 --> 00:09:36,502
- What do you want me to tell them?
- Send them to me.

133
00:09:36,502 --> 00:09:39,861
I'll explain everything.
They'll understand, don't worry.

134
00:09:41,221 --> 00:09:43,701
Anything else?

135
00:10:05,336 --> 00:10:08,176
Your appointment is here.

136
00:10:08,176 --> 00:10:09,855
Who is this guy?
Remind me.

137
00:10:09,855 --> 00:10:10,895
Joseph Kay.

138
00:10:10,895 --> 00:10:12,575
Heads up a department at St. Louis.

139
00:10:12,615 --> 00:10:15,214
- I'm not sure what he wants.
- Heads up a department?

140
00:10:15,214 --> 00:10:16,574
Something like that.

141
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:17,574
"Something like that".

142
00:10:17,574 --> 00:10:18,733
"I'm not sure what he wants".

143
00:10:18,733 --> 00:10:20,133
What's that supposed to mean?

144
00:10:20,133 --> 00:10:21,893
Why send him to me?

145
00:10:21,893 --> 00:10:24,813
- You were recommended.
- By who?

146
00:10:25,012 --> 00:10:27,691
- Who upstairs?
- Ross.

147
00:10:28,012 --> 00:10:30,211
I see.

148
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:37,650
- Your daughter called.
- Oh, yeah?

149
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:39,250
- Your daughter called.
- Oh, yeah?

150
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:41,170
She left you messages at home and...

151
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:42,569
Yeah, I know.
I forgot.

152
00:10:42,569 --> 00:10:44,729
She wanted to talk
about the vacation.

153
00:10:44,729 --> 00:10:47,048
She wanted to know,
was it, "Like the usual?"

154
00:10:47,048 --> 00:10:49,567
This was my daughter
who called or my wife?

155
00:10:49,567 --> 00:10:51,447
Your daughter.

156
00:10:51,887 --> 00:10:54,446
Okay, I'll call her back.

157
00:11:01,365 --> 00:11:02,724
Yes?

158
00:11:02,724 --> 00:11:04,484
All that glucose...

159
00:11:04,484 --> 00:11:06,043
Yes?

160
00:11:06,043 --> 00:11:08,563
Worries me.

161
00:11:09,923 --> 00:11:11,642
I can examine you if you want.

162
00:11:11,642 --> 00:11:13,761
I'm a doctor.

163
00:11:14,562 --> 00:11:15,762
All right...

164
00:11:15,762 --> 00:11:17,681
what can I do for you, Dr. Kay?

165
00:11:17,681 --> 00:11:19,041
You work at St. Louis, right?

166
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:20,560
I don't know if I'm the right...

167
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,961
Nathan, I believe you
have misunderstood me.

168
00:11:22,961 --> 00:11:24,080
I'm very serious.

169
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,440
You mustn't take
hypoglycemia lightly.

170
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:30,278
In fact, you shouldn't
take any symptom lightly... ever.

171
00:11:30,278 --> 00:11:33,198
You can't imagine the number
of cells you burn up every day.

172
00:11:33,198 --> 00:11:34,958
Of course, you'll tell me
you're also manufacturing...

173
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:37,037
- I don't want to interrupt...
- But it's not so.

174
00:11:37,037 --> 00:11:39,317
Neurons can't be replaced.
Some die every day.

175
00:11:39,317 --> 00:11:40,757
Every day a few more.

176
00:11:40,757 --> 00:11:44,476
All that glucose you're pumping in
is just cheap energy.

177
00:11:44,476 --> 00:11:47,195
Very bad for you,
very bad for the neurons.

178
00:11:47,195 --> 00:11:51,114
Thank you for your concern
about my health, but I'm fine.

179
00:11:51,114 --> 00:11:54,953
Now why don't you tell me
what you want from me?

180
00:11:56,073 --> 00:11:57,833
That slight shaking in your hands,

181
00:11:57,833 --> 00:11:59,632
have you had that a long time?

182
00:11:59,632 --> 00:12:01,391
It's a morning thing, right?

183
00:12:01,391 --> 00:12:02,751
When you wake up?

184
00:12:02,751 --> 00:12:06,431
You work too much.

185
00:12:06,431 --> 00:12:07,430
Sure.

186
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:10,310
Excuse me.

187
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:13,190
Oui, mon ange.

188
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:16,109
Yes, sweetheart, I know.

189
00:12:16,309 --> 00:12:18,029
Yeah, yeah.

190
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:20,068
Daddy will call you back,
but now I'm...

191
00:12:20,068 --> 00:12:22,588
wait, hang on.

192
00:12:23,467 --> 00:12:26,706
Would you excuse me a second?

193
00:12:26,947 --> 00:12:28,306
Yeah?

194
00:12:28,306 --> 00:12:31,105
Uh-huh.

195
00:12:31,546 --> 00:12:33,905
Honey, I can't talk to you now.

196
00:12:33,905 --> 00:12:37,024
Rachel, check out
that guy for me... now.

197
00:12:37,024 --> 00:12:38,904
Of course you're coming for vacation.

198
00:12:38,904 --> 00:12:40,744
Sure you are.

199
00:12:40,744 --> 00:12:42,423
No, honey, I can't come get you.

200
00:12:42,423 --> 00:12:44,863
We'll do just like last time, I...

201
00:12:44,863 --> 00:12:47,182
We'll see.

202
00:12:47,182 --> 00:12:49,782
Okay, I'll call you back.
Love you.

203
00:12:49,782 --> 00:12:52,301
Don't ever do this to me again.
Ever.

204
00:12:52,301 --> 00:12:54,061
I've got a screwball in my office.

205
00:12:54,061 --> 00:12:56,140
He may be a screwball,
but he wasn't lying.

206
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:58,701
He's head of a department at St. Louis.

207
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:00,540
Ross didn't tell you anything else?

208
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:02,499
No, nothing.

209
00:13:11,217 --> 00:13:13,697
They say the swan sings only once,

210
00:13:13,697 --> 00:13:15,257
just before dying.

211
00:13:15,257 --> 00:13:16,297
Yes, I know.

212
00:13:16,297 --> 00:13:18,935
He senses he's going to die,
so he sings.

213
00:13:18,935 --> 00:13:20,656
It's not because of the pain.

214
00:13:20,656 --> 00:13:23,015
On the contrary,
he sings because he's glad.

215
00:13:23,015 --> 00:13:24,694
He's glad to die.

216
00:13:24,694 --> 00:13:27,214
- The number of legends about swans...
- Dr. Kay.

217
00:13:27,214 --> 00:13:29,173
They also say swans

218
00:13:29,173 --> 00:13:31,573
guide and keep company
with the dead,

219
00:13:31,573 --> 00:13:33,532
to help them cross the threshold.

220
00:13:33,532 --> 00:13:36,132
That's my favorite...
a very old Celtic legend.

221
00:13:36,132 --> 00:13:37,691
- Yes, I know it.
- You do?

222
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:40,691
- Yes, my wife told me about it.
- Your wife told you about it?

223
00:13:40,691 --> 00:13:42,891
Right.

224
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:45,811
You mean your ex-wife?

225
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:49,370
We all live in glass houses.

226
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:52,609
So I see.

227
00:13:52,609 --> 00:13:55,168
Why don't you finally tell me
what I can do for you?

228
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:58,088
I believe I'm the one
who can do something for you.

229
00:13:58,088 --> 00:13:59,687
But you'll see for yourself.

230
00:13:59,687 --> 00:14:02,367
Certain experiences
can be very unsettling.

231
00:14:02,367 --> 00:14:05,206
I'll see what, for God's sake?
What experiences?

232
00:14:05,206 --> 00:14:09,045
I'm merely pointing out
the need to be prepared.

233
00:14:09,045 --> 00:14:11,125
Is that a threat?

234
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:12,924
No, it's not a threat.

235
00:14:12,924 --> 00:14:14,604
It's a message.

236
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:18,283
But I'm not quite sure
you're ready to hear it.

237
00:14:19,163 --> 00:14:21,162
How come you know
so much about me?

238
00:14:21,162 --> 00:14:22,762
Did you have me checked out?
Did you...

239
00:14:22,762 --> 00:14:24,962
was it Ross
told you all that stuff?

240
00:14:24,962 --> 00:14:27,240
"The need to be prepared".
What's that supposed to mean?

241
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,840
I don't know this Ross person.

242
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,760
I've never met the guy.

243
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:33,641
And I think you know
what I want from you.

244
00:14:33,641 --> 00:14:35,800
I think you know very well.

245
00:15:56,302 --> 00:15:58,101
Hello?

246
00:15:58,101 --> 00:16:00,421
It's me.

247
00:16:01,581 --> 00:16:03,341
Claire, hello.

248
00:16:03,341 --> 00:16:05,621
Yeah, I'm here.

249
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:07,581
Is Tracey there?

250
00:16:07,581 --> 00:16:09,100
Yeah, sure.
You want to talk to her?

251
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:12,220
She called me today.
She wanted me to call back.

252
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:14,699
I know, she told me.

253
00:16:16,459 --> 00:16:20,297
Um, Tracey's asleep.
She's in bed.

254
00:16:20,297 --> 00:16:22,617
Already? Is she okay?
What's wrong?

255
00:16:22,617 --> 00:16:25,936
She waited for you to call all day.

256
00:16:25,936 --> 00:16:28,456
She's drawing things
I don't understand

257
00:16:28,456 --> 00:16:30,655
and waking up at night.

258
00:16:30,775 --> 00:16:32,135
No, she's not okay.

259
00:16:32,135 --> 00:16:35,014
Is there anything I can do?

260
00:16:40,133 --> 00:16:43,412
Let's talk about this
another time, okay?

261
00:16:43,412 --> 00:16:44,812
I'll tell her you called.

262
00:16:44,812 --> 00:16:47,091
Okay.

263
00:17:27,163 --> 00:17:29,443
Nathan.

264
00:17:29,683 --> 00:17:32,202
Nathan!
Nathan.

265
00:17:32,202 --> 00:17:35,681
Listen, I came to apologize
for this morning.

266
00:17:35,681 --> 00:17:39,160
I was a little heavy-handed
and I wanted to apologize.

267
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:42,080
I have something to show you
not far from here.

268
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,080
Nathan, wait.
Listen.

269
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,680
I have something to show you,

270
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:47,479
I just don't know if you'll be able
to handle it, that's all.

271
00:17:47,479 --> 00:17:50,039
I'm fed up with your mysteries.
I'm tired.

272
00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:52,118
Nathan, it'll take
five minutes of your time,

273
00:17:52,118 --> 00:17:54,038
no more.
And then I'm out of here.

274
00:17:54,038 --> 00:17:56,597
You'll never see me again.
I give you my word.

275
00:17:56,597 --> 00:17:59,117
- You give me your word?
- Yes.

276
00:17:59,157 --> 00:18:01,156
I give you my word.
You know who I am,

277
00:18:01,156 --> 00:18:03,155
you know where I work,
you're a lawyer.

278
00:18:03,155 --> 00:18:06,355
If I do anything wrong,
anything at all which...

279
00:18:06,355 --> 00:18:10,114
It wouldn't take you five minutes
to blow my career out of the water.

280
00:18:10,114 --> 00:18:13,073
Nathan, believe me,
it's important.

281
00:18:13,073 --> 00:18:14,273
You have to see it.

282
00:18:14,273 --> 00:18:16,712
I swear.

283
00:18:16,712 --> 00:18:20,312
It's important.
Come with me.

284
00:18:22,191 --> 00:18:25,150
Five minutes.
10 minutes... no more.

285
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:27,991
And then... I'm gone.

286
00:18:34,549 --> 00:18:37,308
You brought me here
just to tell me this?

287
00:18:37,308 --> 00:18:38,468
What the hell does it mean?

288
00:18:38,468 --> 00:18:40,428
Or is that all part of the message?

289
00:18:40,428 --> 00:18:42,468
You come out with these
little riddles of yours

290
00:18:42,468 --> 00:18:44,707
and expect me to...

291
00:18:44,707 --> 00:18:47,786
You see that guy,
the kid in the orange jacket?

292
00:18:47,786 --> 00:18:48,866
Do you see him?

293
00:18:48,866 --> 00:18:50,825
Yeah, I see him.
So what?

294
00:18:50,825 --> 00:18:53,505
Name of Dennis.
10 years ago to this day,

295
00:18:53,505 --> 00:18:54,904
his father died here.

296
00:18:54,904 --> 00:18:58,864
He was waiting for a train
as he did every evening.

297
00:18:58,864 --> 00:19:01,623
He had a good job, happy family.

298
00:19:01,623 --> 00:19:05,742
And one evening, he'd had enough.

299
00:19:05,742 --> 00:19:08,301
And when the express came by,
he jumped.

300
00:19:08,301 --> 00:19:10,461
Was he a friend of yours?

301
00:19:10,461 --> 00:19:12,101
And these last few days,

302
00:19:12,101 --> 00:19:14,701
Dennis has come here
every evening.

303
00:19:14,701 --> 00:19:17,020
- Every evening.
- Do you ever answer a question?

304
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:18,900
Look at him.

305
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,820
- Why should I?
- Look at him.

306
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:24,379
Because in about two minutes,

307
00:19:24,379 --> 00:19:28,258
Dennis there will be dead.

308
00:19:28,258 --> 00:19:30,138
What the f...

309
00:19:36,696 --> 00:19:37,816
You're crazy.

310
00:19:37,816 --> 00:19:40,575
Completely crazy.

311
00:19:57,651 --> 00:20:01,252
You gotta take the Chambers Street Exit,
right across the platform.

312
00:20:18,087 --> 00:20:19,287
Look!

313
00:20:19,287 --> 00:20:20,447
He's got a gun!

314
00:20:20,447 --> 00:20:23,246
He's got a gun!
He's got a gun!

315
00:20:23,246 --> 00:20:25,246
Listen, don't do it!

316
00:20:25,246 --> 00:20:27,285
Please,
put the gun down!

317
00:22:00,065 --> 00:22:02,185
Is this your first time?

318
00:22:02,984 --> 00:22:06,664
You seem kind of young.

319
00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:11,223
He's here to see Dr. Kay.

320
00:22:11,223 --> 00:22:13,663
- Okay.
- He'll come get you in the day room.

321
00:22:13,663 --> 00:22:15,063
- This way?
- Mm-hmm.

322
00:22:15,063 --> 00:22:18,461
I... I think what you're
doing is wonderful.

323
00:22:50,574 --> 00:22:53,214
You came to see him?

324
00:22:53,574 --> 00:22:57,213
He'll be here.
Just have to wait.

325
00:22:59,693 --> 00:23:02,132
Come here.

326
00:23:03,652 --> 00:23:05,692
Come here.

327
00:23:05,692 --> 00:23:08,131
What's the matter?

328
00:23:08,171 --> 00:23:10,611
Something wrong?

329
00:23:13,411 --> 00:23:16,850
Myocardial metastases.

330
00:23:17,089 --> 00:23:18,529
Cancer of the heart muscle.

331
00:23:18,529 --> 00:23:21,049
Super rare, right?

332
00:23:21,409 --> 00:23:23,768
They wrote an article
about me in a magazine.

333
00:23:23,768 --> 00:23:26,367
It's in my room,
if you want to see it.

334
00:23:26,367 --> 00:23:32,366
Apparently, I could croak
from one day to the next...

335
00:23:32,366 --> 00:23:36,725
from one minute to the next.

336
00:23:37,605 --> 00:23:40,964
- Jeremy.
- Nathan.

337
00:23:40,964 --> 00:23:42,364
What do you do, Nathan?

338
00:23:42,364 --> 00:23:45,243
I'm a lawyer. Do you know
if he's going to be long?

339
00:23:45,243 --> 00:23:49,922
The first doc I saw,
you know what he called it?

340
00:23:50,042 --> 00:23:52,761
"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy".

341
00:23:52,761 --> 00:23:54,561
Wow.

342
00:23:54,561 --> 00:23:57,722
Can you believe that guy?

343
00:23:58,881 --> 00:24:01,241
You and me,

344
00:24:01,241 --> 00:24:02,880
we're gonna slap that...
that son-of-a-bitch with a lawsuit.

345
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:03,960
What do you say?

346
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:06,119
Legally, that's not exactly my bag.

347
00:24:06,119 --> 00:24:07,679
Jeremy, hello.

348
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:10,318
- Up already?
- Yeah.

349
00:24:10,318 --> 00:24:12,758
- Happy birthday.
- Yeah, thanks.

350
00:24:12,758 --> 00:24:15,397
You've made a new friend.

351
00:24:15,397 --> 00:24:18,156
- Are you the new volunteer?
- He's a lawyer.

352
00:24:18,196 --> 00:24:20,116
He and I are gonna throw
a doctor's ass in the slammer.

353
00:24:20,116 --> 00:24:24,675
Oh, well... see you later.

354
00:24:25,115 --> 00:24:27,114
Bye.

355
00:24:32,593 --> 00:24:35,313
You smell that stink?

356
00:24:36,112 --> 00:24:37,831
Like something's rotting?

357
00:24:37,831 --> 00:24:39,992
Behind the stink of detergent...

358
00:24:39,992 --> 00:24:42,391
can't you smell that?

359
00:24:42,831 --> 00:24:45,711
It reeks of death around here.

360
00:24:45,711 --> 00:24:49,030
Why do you think
she puts up with it?

361
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:53,749
She had a kid who died.
That's why.

362
00:24:54,469 --> 00:24:58,948
All of us in here
are going out in body bags,

363
00:24:58,948 --> 00:25:01,107
and she knows that.

364
00:25:01,988 --> 00:25:06,146
She thinks that when we see
her little darling up there...

365
00:25:06,263 --> 00:25:07,783
we'll tell him
how mommy's doing.

366
00:25:07,783 --> 00:25:09,503
And we'll take care of him.

367
00:25:09,503 --> 00:25:13,823
Make sure he eats his dinner
and goes to the potty up in Heaven.

368
00:25:13,823 --> 00:25:16,382
Volunteer, my ass.

369
00:25:16,382 --> 00:25:17,981
What about you?

370
00:25:17,981 --> 00:25:19,902
You got a message to send, too?

371
00:25:19,902 --> 00:25:22,181
Who you got up there, huh?

372
00:25:22,861 --> 00:25:26,620
I'm going soon,
so make the most of it.

373
00:25:27,261 --> 00:25:29,620
Some "dearly beloved?"

374
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:31,459
- Or maybe...
- Excuse me.

375
00:25:31,459 --> 00:25:32,939
Hey!

376
00:25:32,939 --> 00:25:34,139
Hey, come back.

377
00:25:34,139 --> 00:25:37,458
I didn't mean it like that.

378
00:25:45,338 --> 00:25:48,537
I don't know how to die.

379
00:25:48,537 --> 00:25:51,257
None of us know how to die.

380
00:25:52,537 --> 00:25:56,176
But maybe...

381
00:25:56,176 --> 00:25:59,095
somewhere deep inside of us...

382
00:25:59,095 --> 00:26:00,815
a part of us does know how.

383
00:26:00,815 --> 00:26:05,814
Maybe it's not as terrible
as it seems.

384
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:08,854
Try and rest.

385
00:26:09,334 --> 00:26:11,134
You know, Nathan,
the dying have taught me one thing...

386
00:26:11,134 --> 00:26:14,533
You know, Nathan,
the dying have taught me one thing...

387
00:26:14,533 --> 00:26:17,612
that you can look death in the face
and go on living.

388
00:26:17,612 --> 00:26:20,052
Our mission here is
to keep them company.

389
00:26:20,052 --> 00:26:22,492
Keep company with those
about to die

390
00:26:22,492 --> 00:26:24,532
so that they can depart in peace.

391
00:26:24,532 --> 00:26:27,091
Great, but what's it
got to do with me?

392
00:26:27,091 --> 00:26:28,212
Me, my.

393
00:26:28,212 --> 00:26:29,731
My little consciousness,

394
00:26:29,731 --> 00:26:32,370
my little comforts,
my little life.

395
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:36,530
What about others, Nathan,
do you ever think about them?

396
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:39,729
And Dennis?
Have you thought about Dennis?

397
00:26:39,729 --> 00:26:41,769
If you knew he was going
to blow his brains out,

398
00:26:41,769 --> 00:26:42,928
why didn't you do something?

399
00:26:42,928 --> 00:26:45,328
Why didn't you try to listen to him?

400
00:26:45,328 --> 00:26:47,569
Who kept Dennis company
so he'd "depart in peace?"

401
00:26:47,569 --> 00:26:50,888
Anyway, how did you know
he was going to die?

402
00:26:50,928 --> 00:26:52,647
This time I want an answer,
none of your...

403
00:26:52,687 --> 00:26:54,287
- I saw it.
- You saw it?

404
00:26:54,287 --> 00:26:55,687
- Yes.
- How did you see it?

405
00:26:55,727 --> 00:26:57,606
Was it written on his face?

406
00:26:57,606 --> 00:27:00,046
- Yes.
- Yes?

407
00:27:00,046 --> 00:27:02,966
Listen, I'm beat.
I didn't sleep last night because of you,

408
00:27:02,966 --> 00:27:05,405
- and I've got to be at work...
- Nathan,

409
00:27:05,405 --> 00:27:06,485
people who come here,

410
00:27:06,485 --> 00:27:09,645
they've already traveled
a long road

411
00:27:09,645 --> 00:27:11,405
paved with suffering.

412
00:27:11,405 --> 00:27:15,044
But they have had time
to prepare themselves.

413
00:27:15,404 --> 00:27:17,564
But often death comes...

414
00:27:17,564 --> 00:27:19,643
unexpectedly.
It can't be predicted.

415
00:27:19,643 --> 00:27:20,803
Yes, I know, yes.

416
00:27:20,803 --> 00:27:24,442
For instance, say you cross
the street at the wrong moment,

417
00:27:24,442 --> 00:27:27,482
or the body just gives out...
just like that.

418
00:27:27,482 --> 00:27:29,201
Snap your fingers,
you're dead.

419
00:27:29,201 --> 00:27:30,641
We see that every day.

420
00:27:30,641 --> 00:27:33,962
And those people never have
time to untangle the knots.

421
00:27:33,962 --> 00:27:36,961
They never have time
to prepare themselves.

422
00:27:36,961 --> 00:27:38,040
And so?

423
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:40,840
And so...

424
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:44,640
the role of the Messengers
is to give those people too

425
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,039
a chance to be reconciled.

426
00:27:47,079 --> 00:27:50,038
- "The Messengers?"
- Yes.

427
00:27:53,958 --> 00:27:55,678
I don't understand.

428
00:27:55,678 --> 00:27:58,477
There are people out there
who know in advance

429
00:27:58,477 --> 00:28:00,558
that someone is going to die.

430
00:28:00,558 --> 00:28:03,276
Let's say they...
"got the message".

431
00:28:03,276 --> 00:28:05,157
And in those cases,

432
00:28:05,157 --> 00:28:09,636
their job is to help that person
depart in peace... reconcile.

433
00:28:09,636 --> 00:28:11,995
- And you're one of these "Messengers?"
- Yes, I am.

434
00:28:12,035 --> 00:28:13,755
- You know who's going to die?
- Yes.

435
00:28:13,755 --> 00:28:15,675
- You see it?
- Yes, I see it.

436
00:28:15,675 --> 00:28:18,715
And you help them depart in peace.

437
00:28:18,995 --> 00:28:21,994
Nathan, I realize it
may be hard to believe...

438
00:28:21,994 --> 00:28:25,154
But Dennis didn't depart in peace.

439
00:28:25,393 --> 00:28:26,713
- No.
- Why?

440
00:28:26,713 --> 00:28:29,433
We don't always succeed.
Sometimes we get there too late.

441
00:28:29,433 --> 00:28:31,672
No one has power over
the hour of death.

442
00:28:31,672 --> 00:28:33,393
No one.

443
00:28:33,752 --> 00:28:35,712
I don't believe you.

444
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:37,792
Have it your way, Nathan.

445
00:28:37,792 --> 00:28:39,672
But these things can still exist

446
00:28:39,672 --> 00:28:42,431
whether you believe
in them or not.

447
00:28:42,671 --> 00:28:45,950
I know when someone's
going to die... I see it.

448
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:50,590
And I make every effort
to prepare them for what's coming.

449
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:53,389
Well, I think I've
heard enough for today.

450
00:29:16,666 --> 00:29:19,746
What exactly are you
trying to tell me?

451
00:29:20,265 --> 00:29:24,265
Are you trying to tell me
I'm going to die soon? Is that it?

452
00:29:24,265 --> 00:29:28,304
I told you everything.
You know everything.

453
00:29:28,304 --> 00:29:30,704
Go fuck yourself.

454
00:29:49,581 --> 00:29:51,021
Hurry up.

455
00:29:51,021 --> 00:29:54,660
Sam.
Sam, hurry up.

456
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:57,140
Bring that over.
Hurry up.

457
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:58,380
Breathe, breathe,
breathe.

458
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:02,419
We need a neck brace and a splint.
Get that here.

459
00:31:11,729 --> 00:31:14,968
Look straight into the light.

460
00:31:14,968 --> 00:31:16,808
Don't move.

461
00:32:01,842 --> 00:32:03,601
The smell of the ghosts.

462
00:32:03,601 --> 00:32:06,481
Follow the smell of the ghosts
and you'll find the flower.

463
00:32:06,481 --> 00:32:08,760
What did you say, sweetheart?

464
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,000
It's a cactus.

465
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,440
It makes a flower once a year,
at midnight.

466
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,960
Only once.

467
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:16,879
At 12:00 noon, the flower dies,
and it smells like ghosts.

468
00:32:16,879 --> 00:32:18,799
The flower smells like ghosts?

469
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:19,919
Yeah,
but it's real nice.

470
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:21,838
Mommy says ghosts smell good.

471
00:32:21,838 --> 00:32:24,158
The Night Blooming Cereus.
Yes, I remember.

472
00:32:24,158 --> 00:32:25,798
Mommy told me about it too.

473
00:32:25,798 --> 00:32:27,917
An Indian legend.

474
00:32:27,917 --> 00:32:29,717
Honey, can I talk to Mommy?

475
00:32:29,717 --> 00:32:32,237
She says she'll call you back.

476
00:32:32,237 --> 00:32:34,476
Tracey?

477
00:32:34,476 --> 00:32:36,796
Hello?

478
00:32:40,596 --> 00:32:42,675
I had everything checked out,
everything...

479
00:32:42,675 --> 00:32:45,355
brain, heart, lungs, blood.

480
00:32:45,355 --> 00:32:47,754
I got my urine tested,
my saliva, my sperm...

481
00:32:47,754 --> 00:32:49,354
they tested everything

482
00:32:49,354 --> 00:32:50,594
and they found nothing.

483
00:32:50,594 --> 00:32:52,273
Nothing at all.
There's the file.

484
00:32:52,273 --> 00:32:53,593
Take a look.

485
00:32:53,593 --> 00:32:55,793
A little hypoglycemia
and nothing else.

486
00:32:55,793 --> 00:32:57,713
Nothing else at all.

487
00:32:58,272 --> 00:32:59,873
I'm very glad to hear that, Nathan.

488
00:32:59,873 --> 00:33:01,712
- I'm happy for you.
- So as of this minute,

489
00:33:01,712 --> 00:33:02,992
you are out of my life.

490
00:33:02,992 --> 00:33:05,112
No phone calls,
no visits, nothing.

491
00:33:05,112 --> 00:33:07,951
If I ever see you again
here or any place at all,

492
00:33:07,951 --> 00:33:09,631
it'll mean the police...
got it?

493
00:33:09,631 --> 00:33:11,151
May I show you something?

494
00:33:11,151 --> 00:33:13,870
- No.
- It's a photograph.

495
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:16,390
Anna Rachevsky.

496
00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:17,750
Very cute.
Now leave.

497
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:19,230
From a Russian family.

498
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:22,390
That photograph was taken
the day she arrived in New York.

499
00:33:22,390 --> 00:33:24,709
I don't give a shit.

500
00:33:24,709 --> 00:33:26,749
Not much money,
father out of the picture.

501
00:33:26,749 --> 00:33:29,148
She wanted to go to college,
but the closest she ever got

502
00:33:29,148 --> 00:33:32,307
was working in
the cafeteria at NYU.

503
00:33:32,347 --> 00:33:34,707
Her boss treated her
like an animal.

504
00:33:34,707 --> 00:33:37,267
The students didn't even notice.

505
00:33:37,547 --> 00:33:38,627
Except one.

506
00:33:38,627 --> 00:33:41,946
He was a foreigner too...

507
00:33:42,026 --> 00:33:44,066
a Frenchman.

508
00:33:44,226 --> 00:33:46,945
She welcomed the kindness
he showed her.

509
00:33:46,945 --> 00:33:48,705
But later, she was fired.

510
00:33:48,705 --> 00:33:51,225
He lost touch with her.

511
00:33:51,225 --> 00:33:53,344
End of story.

512
00:33:55,424 --> 00:33:57,984
Anna Rachevsky, right.

513
00:33:57,984 --> 00:33:59,704
- Coming back?
- Yes.

514
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:03,143
She works at the Greenwind diner
in Queens.

515
00:34:03,143 --> 00:34:04,223
Late night shift.

516
00:34:04,223 --> 00:34:06,462
Not very well paying.

517
00:34:06,462 --> 00:34:10,022
She's had a child...
a son.

518
00:34:10,302 --> 00:34:12,381
You should stop by and see her.

519
00:34:12,381 --> 00:34:15,181
I'm sure she would
enjoy that very much.

520
00:34:15,181 --> 00:34:17,021
I'll do that, maybe, yes.

521
00:34:17,021 --> 00:34:18,981
Good.

522
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:21,901
What?

523
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:24,100
Have you understood me?

524
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:26,340
No.

525
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:28,499
What?

526
00:34:28,499 --> 00:34:30,019
What was it this time?
What did you see?

527
00:34:30,019 --> 00:34:32,219
Tell me.
A blinking light?

528
00:34:32,219 --> 00:34:34,099
Some kind of Christmas tree
that begins to...

529
00:34:34,099 --> 00:34:35,578
No, actually, Nathan,

530
00:34:35,578 --> 00:34:38,178
it's a bright white light
that surrounds the person.

531
00:34:38,178 --> 00:34:39,778
But that's not the most
important thing.

532
00:34:39,778 --> 00:34:42,177
What's the most important thing?

533
00:34:42,177 --> 00:34:46,337
The most important thing
is suddenly you'll just know.

534
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:50,296
You'll know she's going to die.

535
00:35:23,811 --> 00:35:26,171
Nathan?

536
00:35:27,010 --> 00:35:29,250
What are you doing here?

537
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:30,330
Doing?
Well, I...

538
00:35:30,330 --> 00:35:32,769
I'm just here.

539
00:35:33,170 --> 00:35:36,210
You're as handsome as ever.

540
00:35:37,489 --> 00:35:38,729
Well?

541
00:35:38,729 --> 00:35:40,849
What? No, I just...

542
00:35:40,849 --> 00:35:43,088
actually I was passing through.

543
00:35:43,088 --> 00:35:44,688
You doing okay?

544
00:35:44,688 --> 00:35:46,808
You were passing through here?

545
00:35:46,808 --> 00:35:49,127
Yes, I was going back
to the city.

546
00:35:49,127 --> 00:35:51,487
I was in Queens
and I was going home.

547
00:35:51,487 --> 00:35:54,926
I was dying for a cup of coffee,
and here I am.

548
00:35:54,926 --> 00:35:56,446
You go heavy
on the sugar, huh?

549
00:35:56,446 --> 00:35:59,126
Yes. You're looking well.

550
00:36:00,006 --> 00:36:02,125
- What?
- I said you're looking well.

551
00:36:02,125 --> 00:36:03,405
How's your health?
Okay?

552
00:36:03,405 --> 00:36:05,804
You look like you're
in fine health.

553
00:36:05,804 --> 00:36:07,805
Yes, fine.

554
00:36:08,965 --> 00:36:11,204
It's strange for me,
seeing you again.

555
00:36:11,204 --> 00:36:14,084
Excuse me.

556
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:34,880
- Are you married?
- Divorced.

557
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,200
Oh.

558
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,120
I never had the time.

559
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,959
He walked out before marrying me.

560
00:36:39,959 --> 00:36:43,519
He still found the time
to knock me up first though.

561
00:36:43,519 --> 00:36:45,838
A good thing too,
you might say.

562
00:36:45,838 --> 00:36:47,839
A little boy.

563
00:36:50,798 --> 00:36:52,398
- What's this?
- It's for you.

564
00:36:52,398 --> 00:36:54,717
These are my numbers.
This one...

565
00:36:54,717 --> 00:36:56,877
is the direct line
to Rachel, my assistant,

566
00:36:56,877 --> 00:36:58,357
and that's my cell phone.

567
00:36:58,357 --> 00:37:00,836
And don't hesitate to...

568
00:37:00,836 --> 00:37:02,236
if you need me for anything,

569
00:37:02,236 --> 00:37:04,436
if anything should come up,

570
00:37:04,436 --> 00:37:06,116
call me. Okay?

571
00:37:06,116 --> 00:37:09,315
If anything comes up,
I call you.

572
00:37:09,315 --> 00:37:11,435
Okay.

573
00:37:11,995 --> 00:37:14,555
And what could possibly come up?

574
00:37:14,875 --> 00:37:18,474
- How old is your daughter?
- Seven.

575
00:37:18,474 --> 00:37:20,193
Do you speak French with her?

576
00:37:20,193 --> 00:37:22,234
- No, not much.
- You should.

577
00:37:22,234 --> 00:37:24,073
I know.

578
00:37:24,073 --> 00:37:26,473
Look at me,
I hardly speak Russian anymore.

579
00:37:26,473 --> 00:37:29,072
But when my father came back,
he talked and talked.

580
00:37:29,072 --> 00:37:30,793
He wouldn't stop talking.

581
00:37:30,793 --> 00:37:33,631
- Did I tell you my father came back?
- No.

582
00:37:33,631 --> 00:37:36,271
You know, we didn't hear
from him in years.

583
00:37:36,271 --> 00:37:38,311
- From your father?
- Yes.

584
00:37:38,311 --> 00:37:41,030
He disappeared into air.

585
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:44,870
But then two weeks ago
we got a letter.

586
00:37:44,870 --> 00:37:47,149
And in this letter
there was a picture of him

587
00:37:47,149 --> 00:37:48,870
and his phone number
and address.

588
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:51,029
He was driving a cab
in Toronto.

589
00:37:51,029 --> 00:37:55,229
And on the very same day,
he got a letter too.

590
00:37:55,229 --> 00:37:58,068
And in it was a picture of me
and my phone number,

591
00:37:58,068 --> 00:38:00,628
and a round trip ticket to New York.

592
00:38:00,628 --> 00:38:04,947
See? So for the past two weeks
I believe in miracles.

593
00:38:05,707 --> 00:38:08,267
- And the letters were?
- We don't know who sent them.

594
00:38:08,267 --> 00:38:10,306
We tried,
but we never found out.

595
00:38:10,306 --> 00:38:14,865
A Dr. Kay...
at St. Louis Hospital,

596
00:38:14,865 --> 00:38:16,785
does it ring a bell?

597
00:38:16,785 --> 00:38:20,265
Fuck Ocean City,

598
00:38:20,785 --> 00:38:23,344
Here's a long one.
"Dear, Jeremy,

599
00:38:23,344 --> 00:38:25,424
I turn 17 today too".

600
00:38:25,424 --> 00:38:26,864
Oh, his mother's
the one...

601
00:38:26,864 --> 00:38:29,064
Who asked you?

602
00:38:29,064 --> 00:38:31,063
Huh?

603
00:38:31,303 --> 00:38:33,983
"We don't know each other
and you may think this is weird,

604
00:38:33,983 --> 00:38:36,062
but ever since I heard
your story on the radio,

605
00:38:36,062 --> 00:38:38,062
I think about you often".

606
00:38:40,701 --> 00:38:43,021
"I wish you a very,
very happy birthday.

607
00:38:43,021 --> 00:38:45,581
Write me if you want.
Love, Jennifer".

608
00:38:45,581 --> 00:38:47,700
Right, yeah.
I love you too.

609
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:50,140
Next time, send me a snapshot
of your cute ass, Jennifer.

610
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:53,060
Bye, bye.
Happy birthday.

611
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:55,660
Oh, a baby Jesus.
Great.

612
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:57,300
Jeremy.

613
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:59,619
- "Dear Jeremy, blah blah blah".
- Jeremy.

614
00:38:59,619 --> 00:39:02,938
"with our hope you'll be able to leave
the hospital very soon".

615
00:39:02,938 --> 00:39:04,578
Jeremy, can you look at me?

616
00:39:04,578 --> 00:39:07,217
Asshole,
I'm going to die in this hospital!

617
00:39:07,217 --> 00:39:10,217
That's why I'm here,
don't you fucking get it?

618
00:39:13,256 --> 00:39:16,136
Jeremy, what's going on?

619
00:39:16,136 --> 00:39:18,256
What's going on is
that my dumbass mother

620
00:39:18,256 --> 00:39:20,016
went on the radio
to tell the world

621
00:39:20,016 --> 00:39:23,655
that her poor little kid
was having a birthday soon

622
00:39:23,655 --> 00:39:27,175
and the poor angel was dying
of a very serious and rare disease.

623
00:39:27,175 --> 00:39:30,175
And then dozens of assholes
I don't even know,

624
00:39:30,175 --> 00:39:33,854
they're just writing me
to wish me a happy birthday,

625
00:39:33,894 --> 00:39:36,134
and... fuck.

626
00:39:36,134 --> 00:39:37,213
Fuck.

627
00:39:37,253 --> 00:39:39,293
Goddamn it,

628
00:39:39,293 --> 00:39:42,572
why did this have
to happen to me?

629
00:39:43,653 --> 00:39:45,172
I'm 17.

630
00:39:45,172 --> 00:39:47,571
I'm 17 fucking years old,
I don't understand.

631
00:39:47,571 --> 00:39:49,372
Jeremy, you shouldn't
talk like that.

632
00:39:49,372 --> 00:39:50,571
Oh, really?
So what,

633
00:39:50,571 --> 00:39:53,091
I should just sit here
with my mouth shut?

634
00:39:53,091 --> 00:39:57,730
You know what my mom said
when I told her I was gonna die?

635
00:39:57,890 --> 00:39:59,569
She just looked at me
and she was like,

636
00:39:59,569 --> 00:40:03,209
"Oh, no, Jeremy, I forbid
you to say such a thing".

637
00:40:03,649 --> 00:40:06,848
Well, I'm gonna die.
I know I'm gonna die.

638
00:40:07,289 --> 00:40:09,808
And how does that
make you feel, Jeremy,

639
00:40:09,808 --> 00:40:12,088
knowing you're going to die?

640
00:40:15,008 --> 00:40:18,927
I think about all the good shit
I'm gonna miss out on.

641
00:40:18,927 --> 00:40:20,967
And that makes you angry.

642
00:40:20,967 --> 00:40:23,647
Yeah.

643
00:40:26,126 --> 00:40:27,925
And also I just...

644
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:29,606
I don't know.

645
00:40:29,606 --> 00:40:34,805
I want people to see me
like I normally am.

646
00:40:34,805 --> 00:40:36,884
You know?

647
00:40:38,004 --> 00:40:40,764
I want people to listen to me.

648
00:40:41,003 --> 00:40:44,803
I just want someone to listen.

649
00:41:03,801 --> 00:41:06,400
I agreed to see you because...

650
00:41:08,119 --> 00:41:11,679
I agreed to see you because...

651
00:41:12,119 --> 00:41:14,479
you've got a solid case.

652
00:41:21,437 --> 00:41:23,478
I'm sorry,
I don't understand.

653
00:41:23,478 --> 00:41:24,598
I don't speak Creole.

654
00:41:24,598 --> 00:41:27,316
She says she lost both
of her sons in the accident.

655
00:41:27,316 --> 00:41:30,236
She says she knows
you can help us.

656
00:41:33,196 --> 00:41:35,076
- She says...
- Madame, please.

657
00:41:35,076 --> 00:41:36,516
...she's praying for you.

658
00:41:38,795 --> 00:41:40,794
She also said
you have a big heart.

659
00:41:40,794 --> 00:41:42,675
- Tell her she's wrong.
- She can see it.

660
00:41:42,675 --> 00:41:44,994
- She's wrong!
- If you refuse to defend us,

661
00:41:44,994 --> 00:41:46,873
the other lawyers will find out,

662
00:41:46,873 --> 00:41:48,914
and they will refuse too.

663
00:41:48,914 --> 00:41:51,553
- All of them.
- Please, sir, do something for us.

664
00:41:51,553 --> 00:41:54,593
No.

665
00:41:56,432 --> 00:41:59,272
No, that's not true.

666
00:42:03,231 --> 00:42:04,711
Okay.

667
00:42:04,711 --> 00:42:07,231
But you've got a solid case.

668
00:42:08,231 --> 00:42:09,671
Okay.

669
00:42:31,668 --> 00:42:34,107
Pass it, pass it.

670
00:42:35,267 --> 00:42:38,066
- Alonzo!
- Take it home!

671
00:42:52,584 --> 00:42:55,744
"He asked whether the man

672
00:42:55,744 --> 00:42:58,464
"When he heard he was
under Herod's jurisdiction,

673
00:42:58,464 --> 00:43:00,703
"he sent him off to Herod,

674
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:02,943
who was himself
in Jerusalem at that time".

675
00:43:02,943 --> 00:43:04,862
"When Herod saw Jesus,

676
00:43:04,862 --> 00:43:06,342
"he was very glad,

677
00:43:06,342 --> 00:43:09,262
"for he had been wanting
to see him for a long time.

678
00:43:09,262 --> 00:43:10,861
"Because he had
heard about him

679
00:43:10,861 --> 00:43:13,541
"and was hoping to see Jesus
perform some sign.

680
00:43:13,541 --> 00:43:16,100
"Herod questioned him
at some length,

681
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:17,981
but Jesus gave him no answer".

682
00:43:33,658 --> 00:43:36,497
You know, she came

683
00:43:36,497 --> 00:43:41,496
She told me again what a wonderful
husband you were.

684
00:43:41,496 --> 00:43:43,577
Up there,

685
00:43:43,577 --> 00:43:46,936
she sees everything
you do for me.

686
00:43:50,335 --> 00:43:53,414
The Blessed Virgin was
here too, you know.

687
00:43:53,414 --> 00:43:56,054
Oh? The Blessed Virgin
was here?

688
00:43:56,054 --> 00:43:57,294
Yeah.

689
00:43:57,334 --> 00:44:00,134
She watched us
through the window.

690
00:44:03,133 --> 00:44:04,933
You see,

691
00:44:04,933 --> 00:44:06,733
there on the buffet...

692
00:44:06,733 --> 00:44:09,973
that's her hand.

693
00:44:10,572 --> 00:44:12,652
She left that there for us

694
00:44:12,652 --> 00:44:16,012
to let us know
she's thinking about us.

695
00:44:21,490 --> 00:44:24,610
That's your wife's hand.

696
00:44:26,730 --> 00:44:28,969
You could kiss it, you know.

697
00:44:28,969 --> 00:44:31,289
No.

698
00:44:31,289 --> 00:44:34,249
Please.

699
00:44:37,888 --> 00:44:43,008
It's not a mother's job
to bury a daughter.

700
00:44:48,127 --> 00:44:51,086
No, it isn't.

701
00:44:51,446 --> 00:44:55,565
But you have to let the dead
lay with the dead.

702
00:44:55,845 --> 00:44:58,205
You have to.

703
00:45:05,604 --> 00:45:07,683
I saw Anna.

704
00:45:07,683 --> 00:45:08,963
She said she'd never heard of you.

705
00:45:08,963 --> 00:45:12,603
But the picture, the plane ticket...
I know it was you.

706
00:45:12,603 --> 00:45:13,923
What's your game?

707
00:45:13,923 --> 00:45:16,003
Why are you toying
with these people?

708
00:45:16,003 --> 00:45:18,282
I simply did what I had to do.

709
00:45:18,282 --> 00:45:20,002
The father found his daughter again,

710
00:45:20,002 --> 00:45:22,441
and the daughter, her father.

711
00:45:23,122 --> 00:45:25,441
Anna's still going to die.

712
00:45:25,441 --> 00:45:27,841
But hopefully she'll die
more at peace with herself.

713
00:45:27,841 --> 00:45:29,521
It's not a game.

714
00:45:29,521 --> 00:45:32,560
But if she's going to die,
protect her, do something!

715
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:35,480
There's nothing else
I can do.

716
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:40,359
I told you, no one has power
over the hour of death.

717
00:46:05,075 --> 00:46:06,076
Anna!

718
00:46:06,076 --> 00:46:07,035
Anna!

719
00:46:07,035 --> 00:46:09,475
- I think it's for you!
- Who is it?

720
00:46:09,475 --> 00:46:11,394
I think it's Mr. Handsome.

721
00:46:11,394 --> 00:46:13,994
Who is it?

722
00:46:14,554 --> 00:46:16,313
- Nathan?
- Hi.

723
00:46:16,313 --> 00:46:18,833
- What are you doing here?
- Am I disturbing you?

724
00:46:18,833 --> 00:46:22,032
No, of course not.
Come in, come in!

725
00:46:22,032 --> 00:46:23,833
My cousin had
a baby this morning

726
00:46:23,833 --> 00:46:26,072
and we're celebrating his birth.

727
00:46:26,072 --> 00:46:27,992
You must have passed Micha.
He's the daddy.

728
00:46:27,992 --> 00:46:31,071
He just went out with Ivan,
my brother.

729
00:46:31,071 --> 00:46:34,551
And this is Marina, Stephanie.

730
00:46:34,551 --> 00:46:36,590
You've met Judy, my sister-in-law.

731
00:46:36,590 --> 00:46:39,030
Come on, I'll introduce you
to my mother.

732
00:46:39,030 --> 00:46:41,070
Mama.

733
00:46:42,350 --> 00:46:45,109
This is Nathan,
a good friend of mine.

734
00:46:45,109 --> 00:46:47,949
Nice to meet you.

735
00:46:50,068 --> 00:46:51,308
It's okay.
It's okay.

736
00:46:51,308 --> 00:46:55,508
I'll handle it!

737
00:46:58,188 --> 00:46:59,668
We're wired to the building next door.

738
00:46:59,668 --> 00:47:01,667
Maybe they cut something off.

739
00:47:03,267 --> 00:47:05,707
Hey, look who's here!

740
00:47:05,707 --> 00:47:07,586
This is my pride and joy.

741
00:47:07,586 --> 00:47:08,866
This is him!

742
00:47:08,866 --> 00:47:10,346
Papa, this is Nathan.

743
00:47:10,346 --> 00:47:11,945
- Hi.
- Glad to meet you.

744
00:47:11,945 --> 00:47:14,825
We met when I was
working at the university.

745
00:47:19,105 --> 00:47:21,104
Excuse me,
the light doesn't work.

746
00:47:22,184 --> 00:47:23,984
Anna, wait,
you shouldn't touch that.

747
00:47:23,984 --> 00:47:25,623
I've seen Ivan do it.
It couldn't be so complicated.

748
00:47:25,623 --> 00:47:27,503
Stop, please.
It's dangerous.

749
00:47:27,503 --> 00:47:29,383
We cannot just stay
in the dark, can we?

750
00:47:29,383 --> 00:47:30,742
Listen to me, I'm serious.

751
00:47:30,742 --> 00:47:32,782
You have no idea
how many people...

752
00:47:32,782 --> 00:47:34,782
No. Hold this for me!
Hold this!

753
00:47:34,782 --> 00:47:36,262
Just a second.
Okay.

754
00:47:36,262 --> 00:47:38,021
Here.

755
00:47:39,741 --> 00:47:41,461
Ahh.
You see?

756
00:47:41,461 --> 00:47:42,700
It works now.

757
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:45,781
Anna, I have to tell you...

758
00:47:49,460 --> 00:47:51,499
No, please.

759
00:47:52,299 --> 00:47:54,059
Fine. Okay.

760
00:47:54,059 --> 00:47:55,339
You're right.

761
00:47:55,339 --> 00:47:56,939
We'll take care of it later.

762
00:47:56,939 --> 00:47:58,378
Let's have a drink.

763
00:47:58,378 --> 00:48:00,258
I had a check-up recently...

764
00:48:00,298 --> 00:48:01,698
- A what?
- A check-up.

765
00:48:01,738 --> 00:48:02,698
Oh.

766
00:48:02,698 --> 00:48:05,138
And I said to myself...

767
00:48:05,138 --> 00:48:06,337
let's say,

768
00:48:06,377 --> 00:48:08,697
maybe it would be
a good idea if you did too.

769
00:48:08,697 --> 00:48:10,177
Had one.
A check-up.

770
00:48:10,217 --> 00:48:11,856
Me?
Why?

771
00:48:11,856 --> 00:48:12,976
You never know.

772
00:48:12,976 --> 00:48:14,576
If you want,
I got the address...

773
00:48:14,576 --> 00:48:15,696
You want to marry me,

774
00:48:15,696 --> 00:48:16,815
but first you want
to make sure

775
00:48:16,815 --> 00:48:19,976
I'm the picture of health.
is that it?

776
00:48:20,815 --> 00:48:23,095
I was kidding.

777
00:48:23,375 --> 00:48:25,494
Have you ever tasted
Georgian vodka?

778
00:48:25,494 --> 00:48:27,014
No. Will you think about it?

779
00:48:27,014 --> 00:48:28,294
What, marrying you?

780
00:48:28,294 --> 00:48:31,054
If you take me to Paris,
no problem.

781
00:48:31,054 --> 00:48:32,413
Really, I'm fine.
I swear.

782
00:48:32,413 --> 00:48:35,853
I can't see why
you're so worried.

783
00:48:36,052 --> 00:48:37,492
Your health.

784
00:48:40,172 --> 00:48:42,012
Ivan?

785
00:48:42,012 --> 00:48:44,691
Just a moment.
Ivan.

786
00:48:46,051 --> 00:48:47,771
Papa, don't touch that.

787
00:48:47,771 --> 00:48:50,211
Papa!

788
00:48:54,970 --> 00:48:57,969
I have a right to it, my son has a right,
so does my father.

789
00:48:57,969 --> 00:48:59,609
- No.
- Listen, he worked all his life

790
00:48:59,609 --> 00:49:02,489
and now he's up there
and he needs care,

791
00:49:02,489 --> 00:49:04,488
so don't tell me there's
nothing you can do.

792
00:49:04,488 --> 00:49:05,488
You're going to treat him...

793
00:49:05,488 --> 00:49:07,968
If you will kindly listen,
I will explain to you...

794
00:49:07,968 --> 00:49:11,287
I'm going to stay at his side
as long as he needs me.

795
00:49:11,287 --> 00:49:12,647
No, I will not kindly listen.

796
00:49:12,647 --> 00:49:14,767
Excuse me, can I see
your supervisor?

797
00:49:14,767 --> 00:49:16,246
I'm the person in charge.

798
00:49:16,246 --> 00:49:17,846
Everything's fine.
It's okay.

799
00:49:17,846 --> 00:49:19,406
Your father is
a Canadian citizen

800
00:49:19,406 --> 00:49:21,606
and the program only applies
to American residents.

801
00:49:21,606 --> 00:49:24,286
He is insured in Canada.
He has insurance.

802
00:49:24,286 --> 00:49:25,365
- Oh?
- Yes.

803
00:49:25,365 --> 00:49:27,405
In that case,
he's sure to be covered.

804
00:49:27,405 --> 00:49:29,564
In the meantime, for us,
it makes no difference.

805
00:49:29,564 --> 00:49:32,564
- If it's a deposit you need...
- It's all right, don't worry.

806
00:49:32,564 --> 00:49:34,644
- For you it makes no difference?
- No. It makes no difference.

807
00:49:34,644 --> 00:49:36,124
Fine.
You go tell him.

808
00:49:36,124 --> 00:49:37,844
You go up
and tell him yourself.

809
00:49:37,844 --> 00:49:39,124
He's an adult,
you're an adult.

810
00:49:39,124 --> 00:49:40,883
- Mrs. Rachevsky?
- Just a second!

811
00:49:40,883 --> 00:49:43,322
So you go up and tell him
he left Russia for this.

812
00:49:43,322 --> 00:49:45,722
That he came and find his children
in America all for this!

813
00:49:45,722 --> 00:49:48,402
- Mrs. Rachevsky.
- What? What?

814
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:51,921
I'm sorry.

815
00:49:51,921 --> 00:49:53,961
What?

816
00:49:54,761 --> 00:49:57,521
"No one has power over
the hour of death," you remember?

817
00:49:57,521 --> 00:49:59,520
Bullshit.
Pure bullshit.

818
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:00,680
I saved Anna.

819
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:02,599
I got there in time
and prevented her

820
00:50:02,599 --> 00:50:04,560
from touching
that goddamn circuit box

821
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:06,839
and she didn't die.
It was her father who died.

822
00:50:06,839 --> 00:50:08,399
Not Anna...
her father, asshole.

823
00:50:08,399 --> 00:50:09,639
Nathan, calm down.

824
00:50:09,639 --> 00:50:11,879
What kind of game
are you playing with us, huh?

825
00:50:11,879 --> 00:50:13,518
You bring the father
and daughter together

826
00:50:13,518 --> 00:50:14,678
and send me over there.

827
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:16,598
You knew I'd go there.
You knew full well.

828
00:50:16,598 --> 00:50:18,717
You send me over there
just so I'll watch her die?

829
00:50:18,717 --> 00:50:20,037
Is that it, motherfucker?

830
00:50:20,037 --> 00:50:21,477
- Listen to me...
- You think you're God,

831
00:50:21,477 --> 00:50:24,516
but you're nothing but a fucking pervert
and a shitty doctor.

832
00:50:24,516 --> 00:50:26,316
It's like that
at your hospital too, isn't it?

833
00:50:26,316 --> 00:50:28,676
You watch your patients die
one after another.

834
00:50:28,676 --> 00:50:31,436
That's how you get your kicks,
how you get your...

835
00:50:31,436 --> 00:50:33,635
Nathan, tell me what happened.
Tell me.

836
00:50:33,635 --> 00:50:35,755
It was her father who died.

837
00:50:35,755 --> 00:50:37,355
That's what happened.

838
00:50:37,355 --> 00:50:39,474
Anna is fine.
Anna isn't going to die,

839
00:50:39,474 --> 00:50:41,354
and neither am I.
And there's no, like,

840
00:50:41,354 --> 00:50:45,633
light or halo or shit!

841
00:52:05,342 --> 00:52:08,021
Is he still asleep?

842
00:52:09,541 --> 00:52:12,220
Sounds like it.

843
00:52:34,148 --> 00:52:35,108
Nathan.

844
00:52:35,148 --> 00:52:36,867
Nathan!

845
00:52:36,907 --> 00:52:39,307
Claire?

846
00:52:40,067 --> 00:52:41,907
You okay?

847
00:52:41,907 --> 00:52:43,826
- Claire?
- Thank you for calling 911.

848
00:52:43,826 --> 00:52:47,065
All of our operators are busy.

849
00:53:53,292 --> 00:53:55,291
He told us everything was fine.

850
00:53:55,291 --> 00:53:57,690
Who was that?

851
00:53:57,690 --> 00:54:00,250
His pediatrician...
last week.

852
00:54:00,250 --> 00:54:02,769
We saw him 10 days ago.

853
00:54:02,769 --> 00:54:04,848
Nine.

854
00:54:08,328 --> 00:54:10,487
Nine days ago.

855
00:54:10,487 --> 00:54:13,607
He examined Paul
and told us everything was fine.

856
00:54:13,607 --> 00:54:16,126
He said Paul was fit and healthy.

857
00:54:16,126 --> 00:54:18,285
He was probably right.

858
00:54:19,325 --> 00:54:22,644
But now my son is dead.

859
00:54:24,804 --> 00:54:26,364
Yes.

860
00:54:26,364 --> 00:54:29,044
My son is dead,
and you're telling me

861
00:54:29,044 --> 00:54:31,443
the guy who examined him
and said he was fine...

862
00:54:31,443 --> 00:54:33,683
you're telling me
this guy was probably right?

863
00:54:33,683 --> 00:54:35,921
It's probable...
indeed very probable...

864
00:54:35,921 --> 00:54:39,441
that Paul was a victim
of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome.

865
00:54:39,441 --> 00:54:43,600
It's the most
mysterious cause of death.

866
00:54:43,759 --> 00:54:46,639
The most mysterious,
the most arbitrary...

867
00:54:46,639 --> 00:54:49,079
and the most cruel.

868
00:54:49,879 --> 00:54:51,439
You're angry and that's normal.

869
00:54:51,439 --> 00:54:53,198
Let's leave my anger out of this.

870
00:54:53,198 --> 00:54:57,397
Someone didn't do his job
and an innocent child is dead.

871
00:54:57,397 --> 00:54:58,396
That's the reality.

872
00:54:58,396 --> 00:55:00,436
There is no mystery.

873
00:55:00,436 --> 00:55:02,436
An inexplicable death?

874
00:55:02,436 --> 00:55:04,155
I don't know
what that means.

875
00:55:04,155 --> 00:55:05,475
It doesn't exist.

876
00:55:05,475 --> 00:55:08,075
It's just a way to cover up
someone's incompetence.

877
00:55:08,075 --> 00:55:10,874
I see it every day.

878
00:55:13,833 --> 00:55:17,352
If you would like,
there is a procedure...

879
00:55:17,352 --> 00:55:20,511
Perhaps the only one
that allows us to rule out

880
00:55:20,511 --> 00:55:21,671
the most common hypothesis.

881
00:55:21,671 --> 00:55:24,030
Out of the question.

882
00:55:24,391 --> 00:55:25,430
You can take some time
and think about it.

883
00:55:25,430 --> 00:55:28,070
No.
No autopsy.

884
00:55:28,070 --> 00:55:30,509
Out of the question.

885
00:55:31,109 --> 00:55:33,828
I forbid you to touch my son.

886
00:55:43,306 --> 00:55:47,066
Why some are victims,
why others are not is...

887
00:56:07,021 --> 00:56:08,781
"Dear Jennifer,

888
00:56:08,781 --> 00:56:12,300
"I'd like to talk to you
about these long nights when I'm alone.

889
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:16,019
"About the nighttime crossings...

890
00:56:16,019 --> 00:56:19,978
"desert crossings filled with ghosts.

891
00:56:20,138 --> 00:56:21,498
"And about these hearts I hear

892
00:56:21,498 --> 00:56:24,377
"beating deep inside all these rooms...

893
00:56:25,337 --> 00:56:27,896
"deep inside all these bodies,

894
00:56:27,896 --> 00:56:31,695
"these hearts that want to go on beating
and don't give up.

895
00:56:33,655 --> 00:56:39,254
"They say life is worth living,
and they want more of it.

896
00:56:42,453 --> 00:56:44,893
My heart hasn't given up either".

897
00:56:48,851 --> 00:56:50,851
I know it's hard for you.

898
00:56:50,851 --> 00:56:52,810
I know what all this has cost you,

899
00:56:52,810 --> 00:56:55,090
what a stay in a hospital costs...

900
00:56:55,090 --> 00:56:57,449
And I know that
with your night job you...

901
00:56:57,449 --> 00:56:59,489
No, Nathan.

902
00:56:59,729 --> 00:57:00,889
It's kind of you.

903
00:57:00,889 --> 00:57:02,689
I'd just like to help.
It's not much,

904
00:57:02,689 --> 00:57:05,047
but at least you wouldn't
have to worry about money.

905
00:57:05,047 --> 00:57:06,808
That's all.
I can do that, at least.

906
00:57:06,808 --> 00:57:09,047
No.

907
00:57:10,646 --> 00:57:13,806
"Here, they all believe in God.

908
00:57:16,205 --> 00:57:17,605
"But me,

909
00:57:17,605 --> 00:57:21,044
"I believe in this
beating heart of mine

910
00:57:21,044 --> 00:57:23,564
"and this pulsing in my veins.

911
00:57:23,564 --> 00:57:26,363
"I believe in this force
inside of me.

912
00:57:27,803 --> 00:57:30,882
"If you come to see me,
I'll tell you about my life here,

913
00:57:30,882 --> 00:57:33,842
"about those times the fear rises up
and lifts you so high...

914
00:57:33,842 --> 00:57:37,360
"it makes you feel dizzy.

915
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,839
"Hopelessness too.

916
00:57:40,839 --> 00:57:42,760
"You go through these moments

917
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:45,839
"and think you're gone,
and you tremble.

918
00:57:47,039 --> 00:57:49,438
"But sometimes...

919
00:57:49,438 --> 00:57:51,718
"yes, sometimes...
you discover within yourself

920
00:57:51,718 --> 00:57:54,437
"an unsuspected strength.

921
00:57:55,077 --> 00:57:56,796
"You'll see all this strength...

922
00:57:56,796 --> 00:58:00,275
"you will...
if you come to see me.

923
00:58:04,674 --> 00:58:07,353
"I know I'm gonna die soon.

924
00:58:07,353 --> 00:58:10,673
"And I know I'm here
to learn something.

925
00:58:18,231 --> 00:58:20,750
"When I've learned what I've
come to learn,

926
00:58:20,750 --> 00:58:24,670
"I'll go.
I know that.

927
00:58:28,149 --> 00:58:30,389
"But in my head,

928
00:58:30,389 --> 00:58:33,788
I can't imagine
that life comes to an end".

929
00:58:44,145 --> 00:58:47,464
Hi, Nathan, this is Anna.

930
00:58:47,464 --> 00:58:48,505
Am I bothering you?

931
00:58:48,505 --> 00:58:49,784
No, not at all.

932
00:58:49,784 --> 00:58:50,863
How are you?

933
00:58:50,863 --> 00:58:52,303
I, um...

934
00:58:52,303 --> 00:58:54,383
I've been thinking
about your offer

935
00:58:54,383 --> 00:58:57,662
and I think I'm going to accept it.

936
00:58:57,662 --> 00:58:59,701
Good. I'll call my bank right away.

937
00:58:59,701 --> 00:59:01,822
- Okay?
- Yes.

938
00:59:07,540 --> 00:59:09,220
I didn't understand you, angel.

939
00:59:09,220 --> 00:59:10,540
What did you say?

940
00:59:10,540 --> 00:59:12,299
There was a storm last night.

941
00:59:12,299 --> 00:59:14,378
Really?

942
00:59:14,378 --> 00:59:15,818
Yeah.

943
00:59:15,818 --> 00:59:19,257
- Well, what was it like?
- I saw lightning.

944
00:59:19,257 --> 00:59:21,057
Honey, I can't stay
on the phone too long.

945
00:59:21,057 --> 00:59:21,976
- Daddy?
- Yes.

946
00:59:21,976 --> 00:59:24,376
I don't want to go
on the plane by myself.

947
00:59:24,376 --> 00:59:26,375
Why, honey?
What's wrong?

948
00:59:26,375 --> 00:59:28,256
I want you to come
and get me.

949
00:59:28,256 --> 00:59:29,655
You won't be alone.

950
00:59:29,655 --> 00:59:30,854
There will be somebody
to keep you company.

951
00:59:30,854 --> 00:59:32,454
That's the way we've
always done it.

952
00:59:32,454 --> 00:59:34,534
- But I'm scared.
- You're scared?

953
00:59:34,534 --> 00:59:37,334
What are you scared of, sweetie?
There's no reason...

954
00:59:37,334 --> 00:59:39,732
I'm scared of taking
the plane by myself.

955
00:59:39,732 --> 00:59:41,773
I'm scared of storms.

956
00:59:41,773 --> 00:59:44,132
- I'm scared of lightning.
- Do It.

957
00:59:44,132 --> 00:59:45,771
- Daddy?
- Yes?

958
00:59:45,771 --> 00:59:48,610
I want you to come and get me.

959
00:59:48,610 --> 00:59:50,970
Sir, want to come with me please?

960
00:59:50,970 --> 00:59:52,210
- What for?
- Sir, please.

961
00:59:52,210 --> 00:59:55,649
- Get the fuck away from me, okay?
- Honey, I have to go.

962
00:59:55,649 --> 00:59:57,928
- Honey. Honey. I'll call you back.
- Leave me alone, all right?

963
00:59:57,928 --> 01:00:00,048
- Not yet.
- Sir, you need to come with me...

964
01:00:00,048 --> 01:00:02,087
Or what?

965
01:00:02,087 --> 01:00:04,647
Asshole, what are you going to do now?
What now?

966
01:00:04,647 --> 01:00:07,526
All you get down!

967
01:00:32,080 --> 01:00:34,520
Anna, can you hear me?

968
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:36,200
Anna.

969
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:39,079
Anna.

970
01:00:43,158 --> 01:00:44,478
- Are you okay?
- Call someone.

971
01:00:44,478 --> 01:00:48,277
Call someone.
Anna.

972
01:01:31,787 --> 01:01:32,947
Hello?

973
01:01:32,947 --> 01:01:34,626
It's Anna.

974
01:01:34,626 --> 01:01:36,746
I know.

975
01:01:36,746 --> 01:01:38,026
Listen, where are you?

976
01:01:38,026 --> 01:01:39,826
I'll call come and pick you up.

977
01:01:39,826 --> 01:01:41,905
- No.
- Tell me where you are... please.

978
01:01:41,905 --> 01:01:43,825
How much time do I have left?

979
01:01:43,825 --> 01:01:45,064
Tell me when.

980
01:01:45,064 --> 01:01:47,224
Nathan, the time
you have left is your own.

981
01:01:47,224 --> 01:01:49,864
Tell me how long.
Just tell me.

982
01:01:49,864 --> 01:01:51,463
I don't know.

983
01:01:51,463 --> 01:01:53,262
Don't give me that.

984
01:01:53,262 --> 01:01:54,782
You knew for the others.

985
01:01:54,782 --> 01:01:56,741
So tell me when.

986
01:01:56,741 --> 01:01:59,901
All I can do is help.

987
01:01:59,901 --> 01:02:01,540
Nathan, tell me where you are.

988
01:02:55,928 --> 01:02:57,927
May I come in?

989
01:02:57,927 --> 01:03:01,167
I went to see them...

990
01:03:01,167 --> 01:03:03,766
the Rachevskys.

991
01:03:04,766 --> 01:03:06,606
I wanted to tell them

992
01:03:06,606 --> 01:03:09,245
she died because of me.

993
01:03:09,805 --> 01:03:12,205
If I hadn't taken her
to that bank,

994
01:03:12,205 --> 01:03:15,244
she'd still be here with us.

995
01:03:15,404 --> 01:03:18,243
Her son would still have a mother.

996
01:03:19,563 --> 01:03:22,083
But I didn't even have
that much courage.

997
01:03:26,321 --> 01:03:28,041
Do you remember
when you called me

998
01:03:28,041 --> 01:03:31,121
from the hospital that day?

999
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:34,599
You said you'd saved her?
You were wrong.

1000
01:03:34,599 --> 01:03:36,959
Today you say you killed her,
you're still wrong.

1001
01:03:36,959 --> 01:03:41,158
With or without you,
Anna would've died.

1002
01:03:41,158 --> 01:03:44,837
In her father's place,
or a couple of hours later

1003
01:03:44,837 --> 01:03:47,076
falling down a flight of stairs.

1004
01:03:47,076 --> 01:03:48,837
No one knows.

1005
01:03:48,837 --> 01:03:50,596
- No one can know.
- I don't want to die.

1006
01:03:50,596 --> 01:03:52,915
- Nathan...
- I don't want to die.

1007
01:03:52,915 --> 01:03:54,075
I'll say it again.

1008
01:03:54,075 --> 01:03:57,514
No one has power
over the hour of death.

1009
01:04:03,753 --> 01:04:04,952
Hello?

1010
01:04:04,952 --> 01:04:06,992
It's me.

1011
01:04:06,992 --> 01:04:08,792
I want you
to come and see me.

1012
01:04:08,792 --> 01:04:10,551
I want you to come right away...
both of you.

1013
01:04:10,551 --> 01:04:11,871
What's going on?

1014
01:04:11,871 --> 01:04:13,590
It's nothing.

1015
01:04:13,590 --> 01:04:16,670
You must come...
both of you.

1016
01:04:16,670 --> 01:04:19,629
- Nathan, what's the matter?
- Nothing.

1017
01:04:19,629 --> 01:04:21,669
- You can tell me.
- Yeah, sure.

1018
01:04:21,669 --> 01:04:23,828
I'll be okay.

1019
01:04:23,828 --> 01:04:25,268
I just wanted to see you.

1020
01:04:25,268 --> 01:04:27,748
I'm sorry,
I'll call you later.

1021
01:04:27,748 --> 01:04:29,267
You gonna be okay?

1022
01:04:29,307 --> 01:04:30,306
Yeah.

1023
01:04:30,306 --> 01:04:31,866
Are you sure?

1024
01:04:31,866 --> 01:04:33,906
Yeah, sure.

1025
01:04:33,906 --> 01:04:35,745
I'm sorry.

1026
01:04:42,464 --> 01:04:45,263
Paul was dead and...

1027
01:04:45,263 --> 01:04:48,262
I just screamed at her...

1028
01:04:49,222 --> 01:04:51,862
as if she was to blame.

1029
01:04:53,342 --> 01:04:56,501
You never talked to her
about it afterwards?

1030
01:04:56,501 --> 01:04:59,100
No.

1031
01:04:59,340 --> 01:05:00,620
She was right to leave.

1032
01:05:00,660 --> 01:05:03,099
They're both happy.
That's good.

1033
01:05:06,499 --> 01:05:09,498
She always had
a mind of her own.

1034
01:05:09,498 --> 01:05:12,697
Yes.
Always.

1035
01:05:12,697 --> 01:05:15,056
And I love it.

1036
01:05:17,656 --> 01:05:21,015
I remember a little girl

1037
01:05:21,015 --> 01:05:23,535
when I was an intern.

1038
01:05:23,774 --> 01:05:25,974
She came
to the hospital everyday

1039
01:05:25,974 --> 01:05:27,654
to visit her best friend.

1040
01:05:27,654 --> 01:05:32,093
She'd very nearly
drowned in a lake.

1041
01:05:32,093 --> 01:05:35,212
And her friend had
run off to get help

1042
01:05:35,212 --> 01:05:36,572
and there was an accident.

1043
01:05:36,572 --> 01:05:40,851
They'd only just met on vacation.

1044
01:05:40,851 --> 01:05:43,650
They didn't even speak
the same language.

1045
01:05:43,650 --> 01:05:47,249
Yet they were inseparable.

1046
01:05:48,409 --> 01:05:51,368
There was such a bond
between them.

1047
01:05:52,008 --> 01:05:53,968
A strong bond.

1048
01:05:53,968 --> 01:05:56,687
And she came every day.

1049
01:05:56,687 --> 01:05:58,487
Every day.

1050
01:06:03,086 --> 01:06:05,885
She'd hold your hand.

1051
01:06:05,885 --> 01:06:07,245
She had made up her mind

1052
01:06:07,245 --> 01:06:09,484
that she wasn't going
to leave your side.

1053
01:06:09,484 --> 01:06:11,764
And she didn't.

1054
01:06:17,242 --> 01:06:19,642
Why are you telling me this now?

1055
01:06:19,642 --> 01:06:21,402
Why only now?

1056
01:06:21,402 --> 01:06:22,681
I've been here.

1057
01:06:22,681 --> 01:06:26,360
I haven't hidden anything from you.

1058
01:06:26,360 --> 01:06:29,279
I've been right here in front of you
the whole time.

1059
01:06:29,279 --> 01:06:32,639
All you had to do
was open your eyes.

1060
01:06:33,239 --> 01:06:37,838
It was you who questioned me
when I came out of the coma.

1061
01:06:41,237 --> 01:06:45,596
You were the only one
who believed me.

1062
01:06:46,396 --> 01:06:48,835
Yes.

1063
01:07:09,510 --> 01:07:12,910
Kay, where are you?

1064
01:07:15,509 --> 01:07:17,269
Nathan, it's Rachel.

1065
01:07:17,269 --> 01:07:18,789
Everybody here is looking for you.

1066
01:07:18,789 --> 01:07:19,988
Where are you?

1067
01:07:19,988 --> 01:07:21,908
I left six messages
on your cell phone.

1068
01:07:21,908 --> 01:07:24,987
- Will you call me?
- Kay?

1069
01:07:26,347 --> 01:07:28,266
Where are you?
What's wrong with me?

1070
01:07:28,266 --> 01:07:29,986
First of all, don't panic.

1071
01:07:29,986 --> 01:07:33,105
There's a clinic
at the northeast corner

1072
01:07:33,105 --> 01:07:35,064
of 44th and Lexington.

1073
01:07:35,064 --> 01:07:37,065
They'll give you a shot of glucagon.

1074
01:07:37,065 --> 01:07:39,184
- Lexington and what?
- 44th.

1075
01:08:11,576 --> 01:08:13,496
It's okay, Nathan.

1076
01:08:13,496 --> 01:08:16,175
I'm here.

1077
01:08:34,451 --> 01:08:38,091
You're asking me
where we go after we die?

1078
01:08:38,091 --> 01:08:41,010
Nathan, knowing whether
there is an afterlife

1079
01:08:41,010 --> 01:08:42,889
is not the point.

1080
01:08:42,889 --> 01:08:47,089
The important thing is
being alive before you die.

1081
01:08:47,129 --> 01:08:50,687
Today, now.
Fully alive.

1082
01:08:50,847 --> 01:08:53,767
The wonder of life
is in the here and now.

1083
01:08:53,767 --> 01:08:57,246
We always find out too late.

1084
01:09:02,165 --> 01:09:04,204
I've got to go get my daughter,

1085
01:09:04,244 --> 01:09:05,965
and I'm frightened for her.

1086
01:09:05,965 --> 01:09:09,404
So you're going to come with me.

1087
01:09:09,404 --> 01:09:11,323
You're going to come with us.

1088
01:09:11,323 --> 01:09:14,202
This white light, you haven't seen it
on yourself yet, right?

1089
01:09:14,202 --> 01:09:15,562
- No.
- Good.

1090
01:09:15,562 --> 01:09:17,162
That means if you're
on the plane with us

1091
01:09:17,162 --> 01:09:19,001
nothing will happen.

1092
01:09:19,001 --> 01:09:21,201
I don't want to put Tracey in danger.

1093
01:10:14,228 --> 01:10:16,388
Is it him or her?

1094
01:10:41,343 --> 01:10:44,222
This light, what's it like exactly?

1095
01:10:44,222 --> 01:10:45,702
I told you.

1096
01:10:45,702 --> 01:10:48,301
It's like a white halo
shining from the person.

1097
01:10:48,301 --> 01:10:50,060
And you see it all the time?

1098
01:10:50,060 --> 01:10:53,180
No, you only see it once,
and then...

1099
01:10:53,180 --> 01:10:54,459
but that's not what's important.

1100
01:10:54,459 --> 01:10:56,779
I know, I know.

1101
01:11:24,591 --> 01:11:26,791
So who is he anyway?

1102
01:11:26,791 --> 01:11:29,270
- A doctor.
- You work together?

1103
01:11:29,270 --> 01:11:32,070
Not really.
It's kinda complicated.

1104
01:11:32,150 --> 01:11:34,431
He's a friend of yours?

1105
01:11:36,550 --> 01:11:38,910
Why is he here?

1106
01:11:39,350 --> 01:11:40,870
Just traveling with me.

1107
01:11:40,870 --> 01:11:44,229
- I didn't want to travel alone.
- Like Tracey.

1108
01:11:44,229 --> 01:11:46,829
Yeah.
Like Tracey, yeah.

1109
01:11:51,189 --> 01:11:53,229
It's happening tonight?

1110
01:11:53,229 --> 01:11:55,389
Maybe.

1111
01:11:55,389 --> 01:11:56,869
I hope so.

1112
01:11:56,869 --> 01:11:59,789
You can never know in advance.

1113
01:12:48,426 --> 01:12:51,705
You know why I came?
The real reason.

1114
01:12:52,505 --> 01:12:56,225
You came because
you promised her you would.

1115
01:12:56,664 --> 01:12:59,824
You came because
you love your daughter.

1116
01:13:00,984 --> 01:13:03,144
- Don't you?
- Of course I do.

1117
01:13:03,144 --> 01:13:05,464
But there's
something else.

1118
01:13:06,183 --> 01:13:07,864
Naturally.

1119
01:13:07,864 --> 01:13:10,423
Look, Nathan,

1120
01:13:10,423 --> 01:13:12,103
I have a life here

1121
01:13:12,103 --> 01:13:14,383
and I'm trying to build
something solid with Tracey...

1122
01:13:15,903 --> 01:13:18,023
Wait, listen!

1123
01:13:20,423 --> 01:13:23,862
I think I know what
you're trying to tell me

1124
01:13:23,862 --> 01:13:28,342
and I think that we can
avoid this sort of...

1125
01:13:29,742 --> 01:13:31,062
Unpleasantness?

1126
01:13:31,062 --> 01:13:34,662
You know exactly what I mean.

1127
01:13:39,222 --> 01:13:40,862
I want you to come with me.

1128
01:13:40,862 --> 01:13:43,542
I want the three of us
to go back to New York.

1129
01:13:43,542 --> 01:13:45,941
I want you to come home.

1130
01:13:49,180 --> 01:13:52,260
Avoid just that sort of thing.

1131
01:14:53,096 --> 01:14:56,096
Tracey, don't look.

1132
01:15:57,732 --> 01:15:59,492
You go back alone.
I'm staying here.

1133
01:15:59,492 --> 01:16:01,132
I want to stay here.

1134
01:16:01,132 --> 01:16:04,931
- With Tracey?
- Yes, with Tracey, yes.

1135
01:16:05,611 --> 01:16:07,491
- You still need me.
- No.

1136
01:16:07,491 --> 01:16:09,251
I don't know.

1137
01:16:09,251 --> 01:16:11,651
I'm staying, that's all.

1138
01:16:13,570 --> 01:16:18,010
Is there something I should know?

1139
01:16:18,250 --> 01:16:20,810
Something you haven't told me?

1140
01:16:24,770 --> 01:16:27,530
I'm going to miss my plane.

1141
01:16:44,289 --> 01:16:46,849
Honey, do you know how to use it?

1142
01:16:46,849 --> 01:16:49,808
Huh? Press here.
Yes, that's it.

1143
01:16:49,808 --> 01:16:52,248
Good.

1144
01:16:53,568 --> 01:16:55,247
- Daddy?
- Yes.

1145
01:16:55,247 --> 01:16:58,568
The people we saw a while ago...

1146
01:16:58,688 --> 01:17:00,727
- Yes?
- The ones in the accident.

1147
01:17:00,767 --> 01:17:03,247
- Yes?
- The ones who died.

1148
01:17:03,647 --> 01:17:07,807
- Yes.
- Will they have crosses too?

1149
01:17:07,807 --> 01:17:09,727
I don't know.
Maybe.

1150
01:17:11,766 --> 01:17:14,886
But they're not buried
under them, right?

1151
01:17:14,886 --> 01:17:16,006
Who?

1152
01:17:16,006 --> 01:17:18,046
Oh, no.

1153
01:17:19,526 --> 01:17:22,806
But Paul, he's buried
under one, right?

1154
01:17:23,166 --> 01:17:24,366
Yes, honey.

1155
01:17:24,366 --> 01:17:25,686
Listen, honey,

1156
01:17:25,726 --> 01:17:28,245
if anything ever happens to me,

1157
01:17:28,285 --> 01:17:30,285
if I get to feel sick or,
I don't know...

1158
01:17:30,285 --> 01:17:31,605
what do you do?

1159
01:17:31,605 --> 01:17:33,125
- I call Mommy.
- You call Mommy.

1160
01:17:33,125 --> 01:17:34,165
Good, right.

1161
01:17:34,204 --> 01:17:36,565
And who else,
if Mommy isn't there?

1162
01:17:36,565 --> 01:17:38,764
If you have to call for help,
what do you do?

1163
01:17:38,764 --> 01:17:40,685
- I scream.
- You scream?

1164
01:17:40,685 --> 01:17:42,764
Honey, I'm serious.
What do you do?

1165
01:17:42,764 --> 01:17:47,124
I cry?
I know, relax.

1166
01:17:47,124 --> 01:17:48,364
I press here.

1167
01:17:48,364 --> 01:17:50,563
You already showed me.

1168
01:17:51,484 --> 01:17:53,243
Okay.

1169
01:18:31,041 --> 01:18:33,961
Honey,
you remember when...

1170
01:18:33,961 --> 01:18:36,240
when Paul died?

1171
01:18:36,240 --> 01:18:38,401
Do you remember?

1172
01:18:39,280 --> 01:18:42,280
Well, when he died...

1173
01:18:43,200 --> 01:18:44,920
I found a garden slug.

1174
01:18:44,920 --> 01:18:46,959
I remember.

1175
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:49,999
I remember you asked
a lot of questions.

1176
01:18:49,999 --> 01:18:52,160
Lots and lots of questions.

1177
01:18:52,160 --> 01:18:54,840
Like what?

1178
01:18:54,840 --> 01:18:57,639
You asked us where he was.

1179
01:18:57,639 --> 01:18:59,559
We told you,
"Paul is in heaven.

1180
01:18:59,559 --> 01:19:01,519
In heaven with the angels".

1181
01:19:01,519 --> 01:19:04,758
And you asked us
if you could go see him.

1182
01:19:04,758 --> 01:19:07,278
You wanted to go see him.

1183
01:19:07,278 --> 01:19:11,159
And I don't know
if we always said the right thing.

1184
01:19:11,518 --> 01:19:14,718
- It isn't true?
- What isn't true?

1185
01:19:14,718 --> 01:19:16,398
That Paul's in heaven?

1186
01:19:16,398 --> 01:19:17,918
He could be.

1187
01:19:17,918 --> 01:19:19,198
Maybe.

1188
01:19:19,198 --> 01:19:20,717
But to tell you the truth,

1189
01:19:20,717 --> 01:19:22,077
nobody really knows.
Nobody can know.

1190
01:19:22,077 --> 01:19:23,957
- It's something that...
- I know.

1191
01:19:23,957 --> 01:19:25,837
You do?

1192
01:19:25,837 --> 01:19:28,876
When we die they put us
into the ground...

1193
01:19:28,876 --> 01:19:32,397
and slugs eat us, of course,

1194
01:19:32,397 --> 01:19:34,636
and then we disappear.

1195
01:19:34,636 --> 01:19:36,437
And then we don't exist any more.

1196
01:19:36,437 --> 01:19:39,876
Nobody can be sure of that either.

1197
01:19:40,076 --> 01:19:41,916
But you know,
I believe one thing.

1198
01:19:41,916 --> 01:19:44,476
- Want me to tell you?
- Mm-hmm.

1199
01:19:44,476 --> 01:19:46,836
I think just because we die

1200
01:19:46,836 --> 01:19:50,156
doesn't mean we don't exist anymore.

1201
01:19:50,156 --> 01:19:52,475
Maybe we exist someplace else.

1202
01:19:52,715 --> 01:19:54,635
And you know why I think that?

1203
01:19:56,875 --> 01:19:59,435
When you see a boat vanish...

1204
01:19:59,435 --> 01:20:02,315
have you ever seen a boat
vanish on the horizon?

1205
01:20:02,874 --> 01:20:05,474
When a boat disappears
in the distance,

1206
01:20:05,474 --> 01:20:07,114
it vanishes,

1207
01:20:07,114 --> 01:20:09,634
but does that mean
it doesn't exist anymore?

1208
01:20:09,634 --> 01:20:11,514
No.

1209
01:20:11,514 --> 01:20:13,193
Right.

1210
01:20:13,193 --> 01:20:14,953
I believe dying is like that.

1211
01:20:14,953 --> 01:20:17,993
It's like a boat
vanishing on the horizon.

1212
01:20:17,993 --> 01:20:23,193
Just because you can't see it,
doesn't mean it doesn't exist.

1213
01:23:25,980 --> 01:23:28,980
- Can we talk?
- Why did you come back?

1214
01:23:30,860 --> 01:23:32,619
We didn't want to fly.

1215
01:23:32,619 --> 01:23:35,220
Tracey and I were too scared
to take the plane.

1216
01:23:35,220 --> 01:23:38,259
Besides, I'm in no hurry
to get home.

1217
01:23:38,339 --> 01:23:39,699
So what do you plan to do?

1218
01:23:39,699 --> 01:23:41,779
Here?
I don't know.

1219
01:23:41,779 --> 01:23:42,739
Hang out.

1220
01:23:42,739 --> 01:23:44,738
Spend some time with Tracey.

1221
01:23:44,738 --> 01:23:46,098
Go for walks.

1222
01:23:46,098 --> 01:23:48,818
You could maybe point out
some places to go.

1223
01:23:48,818 --> 01:23:51,938
- Tracey told me you two...
- Places to go?

1224
01:23:52,458 --> 01:23:54,338
Nathan, what's the matter with you?

1225
01:23:54,338 --> 01:23:56,977
- Nothing.
- What do you mean, nothing?

1226
01:23:56,977 --> 01:23:59,538
You call me in the middle
of the night as if...

1227
01:23:59,538 --> 01:24:01,658
I don't know.

1228
01:24:02,537 --> 01:24:04,977
Then you show up two days early
with this strange guy,

1229
01:24:04,977 --> 01:24:06,058
and you come out
with these remarks.

1230
01:24:06,058 --> 01:24:09,137
Now you're talking
about going for walks?

1231
01:24:09,137 --> 01:24:10,657
What's going on?

1232
01:24:10,657 --> 01:24:12,817
You have troubles
at the firm, is that it?

1233
01:24:12,817 --> 01:24:14,217
No, not really.

1234
01:24:14,217 --> 01:24:16,657
Then what?
Are you sick?

1235
01:24:16,657 --> 01:24:20,176
No, not that I'm aware of.

1236
01:24:20,736 --> 01:24:22,056
Not that you're aware of?

1237
01:24:22,056 --> 01:24:23,416
No.

1238
01:24:23,416 --> 01:24:26,096
Just a little hypoglycemia.

1239
01:24:44,815 --> 01:24:46,615
When does it happen?

1240
01:24:49,774 --> 01:24:52,974
Two hours from now,
maybe sooner.

1241
01:25:00,613 --> 01:25:03,253
We had ice cream last night,

1242
01:25:03,253 --> 01:25:05,813
and we talked about Paul.

1243
01:25:05,933 --> 01:25:07,653
On the road
we saw some crosses,

1244
01:25:07,653 --> 01:25:10,573
and afterwards she wanted to...

1245
01:25:11,973 --> 01:25:14,773
does she talk to you about it?

1246
01:25:15,052 --> 01:25:16,732
Not so much these days.

1247
01:25:16,732 --> 01:25:17,972
But is she all right?

1248
01:25:17,972 --> 01:25:19,652
The last time on the phone
when I called,

1249
01:25:19,652 --> 01:25:23,532
- she was already asleep...
- She wasn't asleep.

1250
01:25:24,292 --> 01:25:26,291
She wasn't asleep?

1251
01:25:26,291 --> 01:25:28,132
- No.
- Can't you take a break?

1252
01:25:28,132 --> 01:25:29,412
Five minutes.

1253
01:25:29,412 --> 01:25:32,211
Nathan, in one hour
this flower will be dead.

1254
01:25:32,211 --> 01:25:34,171
It blooms one night a year,
just the once,

1255
01:25:34,171 --> 01:25:37,531
- and I still have...
- Yes, I know that, but...

1256
01:25:39,171 --> 01:25:41,170
sorry.

1257
01:25:50,370 --> 01:25:53,210
When we went home
to New York...

1258
01:25:53,810 --> 01:25:55,969
do you remember
the first thing you did?

1259
01:25:55,969 --> 01:25:58,969
The first.

1260
01:26:00,009 --> 01:26:02,769
You called the office.

1261
01:26:03,329 --> 01:26:06,448
You wanted to know
if anyone had called.

1262
01:26:07,608 --> 01:26:09,929
We'd just buried Paul,

1263
01:26:09,929 --> 01:26:13,128
and you disappeared
into your work.

1264
01:26:15,288 --> 01:26:17,568
You shut yourself off
in your anger.

1265
01:26:17,568 --> 01:26:20,888
But Tracey and I were still there.

1266
01:26:20,888 --> 01:26:23,408
We were alive.

1267
01:26:23,927 --> 01:26:25,647
I know you felt guilty.

1268
01:26:25,647 --> 01:26:27,688
I know that you blamed yourself

1269
01:26:27,688 --> 01:26:28,888
because you heard him cry

1270
01:26:28,888 --> 01:26:30,047
and you didn't go check on him.

1271
01:26:30,047 --> 01:26:32,927
- He called me.
- No.

1272
01:26:32,927 --> 01:26:36,407
Paul cried
and he went back to sleep,

1273
01:26:36,407 --> 01:26:38,247
and even if...

1274
01:26:38,247 --> 01:26:41,966
He called me,
but I didn't go to him.

1275
01:26:41,966 --> 01:26:45,486
Nathan, Paul didn't call anyone.

1276
01:26:45,766 --> 01:26:47,166
Paul's dead.

1277
01:26:47,166 --> 01:26:50,526
I've accepted that and so has Tracey.

1278
01:26:50,526 --> 01:26:53,405
She's accepted it
in her own little way.

1279
01:26:53,805 --> 01:26:55,806
And now you... you need
to accept it too.

1280
01:26:55,806 --> 01:26:58,805
- I'm ready.
- You need to stop...

1281
01:26:59,645 --> 01:27:02,085
I don't know.

1282
01:27:02,924 --> 01:27:04,284
I don't know, Nathan.

1283
01:27:04,284 --> 01:27:06,845
I don't know what to tell you.

1284
01:27:07,324 --> 01:27:12,724
I'm ready.
I came back to tell you.

1285
01:27:13,724 --> 01:27:16,523
And if anything
ever happens to me...

1286
01:27:17,324 --> 01:27:20,164
Why do you say that?

1287
01:27:20,164 --> 01:27:23,283
I wanted you to know
that I've changed.

1288
01:27:42,482 --> 01:27:45,322
I know a river not far from here.

1289
01:27:48,002 --> 01:27:50,561
If you want, I could
show you how to get there.

1290
01:27:50,561 --> 01:27:51,801
Yeah.

1291
01:27:51,801 --> 01:27:54,081
I'd like that.

1292
01:27:54,361 --> 01:27:57,041
A pretty river.

1293
01:27:58,120 --> 01:28:00,521
Right.

1294
01:28:05,240 --> 01:28:09,440
- Not very far?
- No.

1295
01:28:22,200 --> 01:28:25,679
Forgive me.

1296
01:28:53,917 --> 01:28:56,917
Hi, this is Rachel calling
from Nathan's office.

1297
01:28:56,917 --> 01:28:58,956
I'm sorry to bother you, but...

1298
01:28:58,956 --> 01:29:02,517
he's not at home and hasn't been by
the office in several days.

1299
01:29:02,517 --> 01:29:04,756
We can't reach him
on his cell phone either.

1300
01:29:04,756 --> 01:29:07,836
We're worried and thought
maybe you'd heard from him.

1301
01:29:07,836 --> 01:29:10,396
Could you please call us
if you've got any news?

1302
01:29:39,994 --> 01:29:42,554
They're looking for you.

1303
01:29:44,194 --> 01:29:47,114
Yes, I know.

1304
01:30:07,912 --> 01:30:09,632
"Someone once told me,

1305
01:30:09,632 --> 01:30:13,872
"'The wonder of life is
in the here and now. '

1306
01:30:14,471 --> 01:30:17,191
"I'm going to die soon.

1307
01:30:17,671 --> 01:30:22,071
"And yet, I'm no longer
dominated by fear.

1308
01:30:24,791 --> 01:30:27,710
"Life is full of riches...

1309
01:30:27,710 --> 01:30:29,670
"the gestures, the laughter,

1310
01:30:29,670 --> 01:30:32,430
"the joy we shared.

1311
01:30:32,870 --> 01:30:35,630
"I remember it all.

1312
01:30:40,229 --> 01:30:42,430
"I remember your breathing too,

1313
01:30:42,430 --> 01:30:43,789
"when you slept in the car.

1314
01:30:43,789 --> 01:30:46,629
"Mommy's face when she saw us.

1315
01:30:46,629 --> 01:30:48,869
"We did a lot of things together.

1316
01:30:48,869 --> 01:30:50,668
Lots and lots of things".

1317
01:30:53,308 --> 01:30:55,869
"I've learned a lot.

1318
01:30:56,228 --> 01:30:59,508
I've met some wonderful people".

1319
01:30:59,748 --> 01:31:03,148
Hi, I... I'm Jennifer.

1320
01:31:14,907 --> 01:31:17,107
"Cherish your happiness.

1321
01:31:17,107 --> 01:31:20,426
"Savor it at every instant.

1322
01:31:22,227 --> 01:31:23,546
"And above all,

1323
01:31:23,546 --> 01:31:27,066
"don't get upset if you think of me.

1324
01:31:27,426 --> 01:31:29,106
"Don't be sad.

1325
01:31:47,545 --> 01:31:50,224
"And one day,
if you want to talk to me...

1326
01:31:50,224 --> 01:31:52,624
"if you really want to...

1327
01:31:52,624 --> 01:31:54,344
"pick a spot you like.

1328
01:31:54,344 --> 01:31:58,024
"A spot where we used
to go together.

1329
01:32:00,384 --> 01:32:03,783
"You'll be able
to talk to me... you'll see.

1330
01:32:04,464 --> 01:32:07,104
"Because I'll be there.

1331
01:32:16,023 --> 01:32:17,463
"And remember,

1332
01:32:17,463 --> 01:32:21,102
"don't be ashamed to tell people
you care about

1333
01:32:21,102 --> 01:32:23,423
"that you love them.

1334
01:32:24,222 --> 01:32:28,342
I love you both very much".

1335
01:32:49,980 --> 01:32:52,060
Did you sleep well?

1336
01:32:52,060 --> 01:32:53,940
Yes.

1337
01:32:55,100 --> 01:32:57,459
Want me to make you a fresh pot?

1338
01:32:57,459 --> 01:32:59,820
No, it's okay.

1339
01:34:09,775 --> 01:34:11,854
I need to see you.
You've got to get out here.

1340
01:34:11,854 --> 01:34:13,655
I need to see you now,
understand?

1341
01:34:13,655 --> 01:34:15,694
- I'm here.
- Take the first flight...

1342
01:34:15,694 --> 01:34:17,694
I'm here.
I'm here with you.

1343
01:34:17,694 --> 01:34:19,373
What do you mean here?

1344
01:34:19,373 --> 01:34:22,293
On the road to the airport...
the Crossroads Motel.

1345
01:34:22,293 --> 01:34:23,934
I'm here.

1346
01:34:23,934 --> 01:34:26,773
I'll wait for you here.

1347
01:35:06,451 --> 01:35:08,170
You lied to me from the start.

1348
01:35:08,170 --> 01:35:09,490
No.

1349
01:35:09,490 --> 01:35:11,050
You said it was me.

1350
01:35:11,050 --> 01:35:13,010
You said so.

1351
01:35:13,410 --> 01:35:16,010
You said I was the one
who was going to die.

1352
01:35:16,010 --> 01:35:19,090
So what did I see?
Tell me.

1353
01:35:19,090 --> 01:35:21,290
I was the one who
was supposed to die.

1354
01:35:21,290 --> 01:35:22,889
It was supposed to be me!

1355
01:35:22,889 --> 01:35:24,769
You said so!

1356
01:35:24,769 --> 01:35:27,689
No.

1357
01:35:30,129 --> 01:35:32,849
Nathan?

1358
01:35:39,608 --> 01:35:41,008
Tracey, have you seen daddy?

1359
01:35:41,008 --> 01:35:42,968
No.

1360
01:36:05,287 --> 01:36:07,646
I'm a Messenger, right?

1361
01:36:08,846 --> 01:36:11,046
Yes.

1362
01:36:11,406 --> 01:36:14,286
And my wife is going to die.

1363
01:36:16,126 --> 01:36:17,926
Yes.

1364
01:36:17,926 --> 01:36:19,206
Why didn't you tell me

1365
01:36:19,206 --> 01:36:21,405
when you came to see me
the first time

1366
01:36:21,405 --> 01:36:23,445
instead of being so mysterious.

1367
01:36:23,445 --> 01:36:25,845
The swan's song and all that bullshit.

1368
01:36:25,845 --> 01:36:27,285
You wouldn't have believed me.

1369
01:36:27,285 --> 01:36:28,764
You never would have believed me.

1370
01:36:28,764 --> 01:36:30,605
I was trying to prepare you.

1371
01:36:30,605 --> 01:36:32,245
Prepare me for what?

1372
01:36:32,245 --> 01:36:34,364
You're a Messenger.

1373
01:36:34,364 --> 01:36:35,924
A teacher of life.

1374
01:36:35,924 --> 01:36:37,724
But to be a teacher of life

1375
01:36:37,724 --> 01:36:40,364
you have to remember
your own mortality.

1376
01:36:40,364 --> 01:36:43,284
- You have to.
- But why does she have to die?

1377
01:36:43,284 --> 01:36:45,003
Why her?

1378
01:36:45,003 --> 01:36:49,283
All Messengers lose
the person closest to them.

1379
01:36:50,323 --> 01:36:53,883
That's the price...
the price of grace.

1380
01:36:54,123 --> 01:36:55,523
I paid the same price.

1381
01:36:55,523 --> 01:36:56,963
But in time,

1382
01:36:56,963 --> 01:36:59,643
you'll know that you
were there until the very end.

1383
01:36:59,643 --> 01:37:02,442
Through the very end.

1384
01:37:02,962 --> 01:37:05,003
That's the price
of becoming a Messenger.

1385
01:37:05,003 --> 01:37:06,842
But I never asked for this.

1386
01:37:06,842 --> 01:37:09,522
Nobody ever gave me a choice.

1387
01:37:10,242 --> 01:37:11,921
You made your choice, Nathan.

1388
01:37:11,921 --> 01:37:14,402
You made your choice
when you decided to come back

1389
01:37:14,402 --> 01:37:16,521
after you had died on that road.

1390
01:37:16,521 --> 01:37:17,961
And you came back.

1391
01:37:17,961 --> 01:37:19,722
And now you know why.

1392
01:37:19,722 --> 01:37:22,361
What brought you back?

1393
01:37:23,521 --> 01:37:25,081
A face.

1394
01:37:25,081 --> 01:37:26,960
Whose face?

1395
01:37:28,480 --> 01:37:30,920
Claire's face.

1396
01:37:32,920 --> 01:37:35,360
She was afraid.

1397
01:37:36,960 --> 01:37:39,520
She needed me.

1398
01:38:29,476 --> 01:38:31,636
Where were you?

1399
01:38:33,556 --> 01:38:35,996
I got lost.

1400
01:38:37,876 --> 01:38:40,156
We were waiting for you.

1401
01:38:40,236 --> 01:38:42,715
I got lost.

1402
01:38:45,435 --> 01:38:48,275
We thought that you'd left us...

1403
01:38:49,435 --> 01:38:52,595
that you'd...

1404
01:38:55,275 --> 01:38:59,034
- We were worried.
- I know.

1405
01:38:59,674 --> 01:39:02,034
But don't be scared.

1406
01:39:02,034 --> 01:39:04,554
I'm here now.

1407
01:39:05,354 --> 01:39:08,273
I'll never leave you again.

1408
01:39:13,513 --> 01:39:16,273
I'm here.

1409
01:39:17,273 --> 01:39:27,273
