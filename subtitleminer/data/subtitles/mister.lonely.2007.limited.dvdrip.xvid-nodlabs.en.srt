39
00:03:42,141 --> 00:03:45,370
<i>It is easier to see things in others,</i>

40

45
00:04:06,749 --> 00:04:10,164
<i>It is time to become who we're not,</i>

46
00:04:10,237 --> 00:04:13,750
<i>to change our face

47
00:04:16,157 --> 00:04:19,386
<i>I think the world is a better place that way.</i>

52
00:05:49,405 --> 00:05:51,642
You look good, my friend.

53

Good, strong skin. Beautiful.

- Michael, you still like Paris?
- Mm, not really. It's too hot.

56
00:06:02,652 --> 00:06:06,995
The heat is not good for the dancing.
It ruins my makeup, but anyway...

57
00:06:07,069 --> 00:06:09,305
<i>Très chaud, très chaud, oui.</i>

58

Yeah.

60
00:06:14,813 --> 00:06:16,918
Want a coffee? Expresso?

61
00:06:17,469 --> 00:06:19,443

63

But you look sad, no?

64
00:06:26,044 --> 00:06:27,833
No, no, I'm OK, I'm OK.

65
00:06:27,901 --> 00:06:30,771
I think you need more friends, more people.

66
00:06:31,804 --> 00:06:35,798
Well, I don't speak French
and I know no one here.

67
00:06:35,869 --> 00:06:37,778
You know me.

68
00:06:38,941 --> 00:06:41,275
You should come here more.

69
00:06:41,341 --> 00:06:44,854
Yeah, but you forgot about me, Renard.

70
00:06:44,925 --> 00:06:47,642
<i>Mmm,jamais, jamais, jamais.</i>

71
00:06:47,709 --> 00:06:49,564
I don't forget.

72
00:06:49,629 --> 00:06:55,543
I tell everybody I've got the best
Michael Jackson, the very best Michael.

73
00:06:55,613 --> 00:06:59,322
And I got you a job.
I've got you a good job.

74
00:06:59,388 --> 00:07:01,493
Nice money, easy.

75
00:07:01,564 --> 00:07:04,598
- Go to the old people's home.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

76
00:07:04,669 --> 00:07:07,222
Dance for them again. They love you.

77
00:07:07,932 --> 00:07:10,932
Give them a nice day,
et cetera, et cetera.

78
00:07:11,005 --> 00:07:14,071
OK, that's good news.

79
00:07:14,141 --> 00:07:16,378
You see, I don't forget you.

80
00:07:17,373 --> 00:07:20,243
- You need money?
- No, no, I'm fine.

81
00:07:20,316 --> 00:07:22,072
<i>You need money.</i>

82
00:07:22,141 --> 00:07:25,588
No, I'm fine, Renard. I'm...
Seriously, Renard, I'm fine, rea...

83
00:07:25,661 --> 00:07:27,766
You need money.

84
00:07:29,213 --> 00:07:31,384
OK.

85
00:07:31,453 --> 00:07:32,729
Thank you.

86
00:07:33,565 --> 00:07:35,834
I'm gonna go. Thank you.

87
00:07:35,901 --> 00:07:38,105
Come and see me. I'll take you out.

88
00:07:38,173 --> 00:07:44,218
We'll go to a place where they have
this good steak, green sauce. You'll like it.

89
00:07:44,668 --> 00:07:47,483
- OK.
- And I'll introduce you to a French woman.

90
00:07:47,548 --> 00:07:50,134
<i>Nice woman, a strip-teaseuse.</i>

91
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:53,682
- What?
- Mmm, a stripper,

92
00:07:53,756 --> 00:07:57,171
but with a great, beautiful mind.

93
00:07:59,324 --> 00:08:00,731
OK.

94
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:04,373

- I'm an American.
- Oh, I see.

158
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:27,130
<i>- I saw you at the house.
- I saw you too.</i>

159
00:12:27,197 --> 00:12:30,295
You were great.
You're an incredible dancer.

160
00:12:31,901 --> 00:12:34,137
Thank you. You, too.

161
00:12:35,516 --> 00:12:39,259
- I mean, you're great, too. Incredible.
- Thanks.

162
00:12:39,325 --> 00:12:41,627
- Do you want a coffee?
- Hmm...

163
00:12:42,461 --> 00:12:44,370
- Red wine?
- Oh!

164
00:12:46,237 --> 00:12:50,131
<i>Excusez-moi, deux verres
de vin rouge, s'il vous plaît.</i>

165
00:12:50,204 --> 00:12:51,797
<i>Merci.</i>

166
00:12:54,652 --> 00:12:57,140
- Do you live in Paris?
- Yeah, yeah.

167
00:12:57,213 --> 00:13:00,409
Not far from here,
where the immigrants live.

168
00:13:00,476 --> 00:13:02,843
- Here?
- Yeah, in the city.

169
00:13:02,909 --> 00:13:05,298
Wow, you must love it here.

170
00:13:07,132 --> 00:13:08,987
No, not really.

171
00:13:09,404 --> 00:13:10,997
Oh.

172
00:13:12,604 --> 00:13:14,906
How long have you been Michael?

173
00:13:14,972 --> 00:13:18,387
Hmm, I don't know.
I guess I was born this way.

174
00:13:22,877 --> 00:13:25,244
<i>Mmm, oui.</i>

175
00:13:25,308 --> 00:13:27,697
<i>Bonjour.
Do you speak English?</i>

176
00:13:29,468 --> 00:13:31,770
- Do you like Marilyn Monroe?
- Yes.

177
00:13:31,836 --> 00:13:33,243
So cute.

178
00:13:33,308 --> 00:13:35,163
<i>- Au revoir.
- Merci.</i>

179
00:13:35,228 --> 00:13:36,657
<i>Au revoir.</i>

180
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:41,337
So how long have you been Marilyn?

181
00:13:42,173 --> 00:13:44,180
Since I first got my boobs.

182
00:13:45,565 --> 00:13:47,703
<i>- Of course.
- Of course!</i>

183
00:13:48,189 --> 00:13:49,879
<i>Merci.</i>

184
00:13:50,013 --> 00:13:51,801
<i>Merci.</i>

185
00:13:51,869 --> 00:13:53,778
<i>- Salut!
- Chin-chin.</i>

186
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:58,323
I am married.
I have been married for seven years,

187
00:13:58,397 --> 00:14:01,244
and my husband,
he lives as Charlie Chaplin.

188
00:14:01,308 --> 00:14:03,730
He was Buster Keaton
before he became Chaplin.

189
00:14:03,805 --> 00:14:07,929
I met him on a cruise ship while he was
doing his act. We have a daughter as well.

190
00:14:07,997 --> 00:14:09,011
- Really?
- Yeah.

191
00:14:09,084 --> 00:14:11,702
- How old is she?
- She's six, almost seven.

192
00:14:11,772 --> 00:14:13,845
She lives as Shirley Temple.

193
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:17,461
- She impersonates?
- Yeah! Well, she tries.

194
00:14:17,532 --> 00:14:21,013
- But she's so young.
- I know, but she seems to enjoy it,

195
00:14:21,085 --> 00:14:25,241
and her father, you know,
it's very important for him.

196
00:14:27,484 --> 00:14:30,932
So, what? Charles Chaplin
meets Marilyn Monroe on a cruise ship

197
00:14:31,004 --> 00:14:34,103
and they have a daughter
named Shirley Temple?

198
00:14:34,173 --> 00:14:39,323
Yeah, kind of. I wasn't Marilyn yet
when I met Charlie, but he showed me.

199
00:14:39,388 --> 00:14:40,981
Mmm.

200
00:14:43,484 --> 00:14:45,939
- When are you leaving?
- I leave in two days.

201
00:14:46,012 --> 00:14:48,019
- On Sunday?
- Yeah.

202
00:14:48,092 --> 00:14:49,685
Hm.

203
00:14:50,364 --> 00:14:52,819
Where do you live?

204
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,802
I live in the Highlands.

205
00:14:54,877 --> 00:14:57,560
- Really?
- Yeah, way up.

206
00:14:58,717 --> 00:15:00,440
Why?

207
00:15:01,372 --> 00:15:05,682
Well, it's kind of a long story,
but I guess it's not that long.

208
00:15:05,756 --> 00:15:08,123
But isn't it cold over there, like freezing?

209
00:15:08,188 --> 00:15:09,781
No, no, no, no, no.

210
00:15:09,852 --> 00:15:14,008
It's cold, like, half the year
and the other half it's warm.

211
00:15:14,972 --> 00:15:18,267
- And what do you do there?
- We do lots of things,

212
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:21,944
like, some people take care of the animals,
some people garden,

213
00:15:22,013 --> 00:15:24,696
some people take care of the house.

214
00:15:24,764 --> 00:15:30,067
Sometimes we perform for each other, then
we go out and perform for other people.

215
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:33,653
It's so beautiful there.
There are mountains all around.

216
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:36,692
You would just not believe
how beautiful it is.

217
00:15:36,764 --> 00:15:40,409
And we're building a great stage and
we're gonna put a show on every night,

218
00:15:40,476 --> 00:15:43,575
and it's only for people like us -
impersonators.

219
00:15:43,645 --> 00:15:46,776
It's gonna be the greatest show on earth.

220
00:15:47,804 --> 00:15:49,876
It's such a special place.

221
00:15:51,069 --> 00:15:55,379
A place where everyone is famous
and no one ages.

222
00:15:55,452 --> 00:15:58,748
A place that we created
and built ourselves.

223
00:15:58,812 --> 00:16:02,041
There's gonna be nowhere like it on earth.

224
00:16:04,476 --> 00:16:06,581
Do you wanna come?

225
00:16:06,652 --> 00:16:09,685
I would love it if you came.
They would love you there!

226
00:16:09,756 --> 00:16:12,309
- No, I don't think so.
- Why not?

227
00:16:14,172 --> 00:16:17,849
- I don't know, what would I do there?
- Anything at all, anything you want.

228
00:16:17,916 --> 00:16:19,825
We have many extra rooms.

229
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:24,024
And we need a Michael.
We don't have a Michael.

230
00:16:24,092 --> 00:16:27,092
No, I... I wouldn't know
what to do in a commune.

231
00:16:27,164 --> 00:16:29,717
Neither did I, but there's plenty you can do.

232
00:16:30,044 --> 00:16:33,524
Oh, Michael, say you'll come.

233
00:16:33,596 --> 00:16:35,090
Please come.

234
00:16:35,164 --> 00:16:37,717
You must, you simply must.

235
00:16:39,804 --> 00:16:42,138
I really don't know.

236
00:17:09,948 --> 00:17:11,857
Goodbye, room.

237
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:16,122
You've been really nice to me.

238
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:18,773
You served me well.

239
00:17:19,068 --> 00:17:21,435
The chair was nice to sit upon.

240
00:17:22,716 --> 00:17:25,400
The bed was good comfort at nights.

241
00:17:26,396 --> 00:17:30,804
And the windows,
the windows allowed me to see the world.

242
00:17:30,876 --> 00:17:33,559
You've been a wonderful room to me.

243
00:17:34,301 --> 00:17:36,537
But I gotta go.

244
00:17:38,108 --> 00:17:39,930
I gotta leave you.

245
00:17:39,996 --> 00:17:43,379
Remember,
I'll always remember you forever

246
00:17:43,452 --> 00:17:46,485
and I'm sure you'll always remember me.

247
00:18:01,692 --> 00:18:03,285
<i>Adios.</i>

248
00:18:46,236 --> 00:18:50,295
No, come on, Eugenio, you can't fly
this plane. You cannot fly this plane.

249
00:18:50,364 --> 00:18:52,884
What, you think I can't manage that?

250
00:18:52,956 --> 00:18:56,339
I know that you can manage that.
I know you can manage it.

251
00:18:56,412 --> 00:18:58,517
- You know me...
- No, we have to drop food.

252
00:18:58,588 --> 00:19:02,232
We are flying out, we are not flying
to Los Angeles. We are not flying...

253
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:06,326
I've seen you a lot.
Your name is Eugenio?

254
00:19:06,396 --> 00:19:09,462
Eugene. I fly to Denver, Colorado
or Mexico.

255
00:19:09,532 --> 00:19:13,078
Yeah, but I can't let you fly.
You see, we have to drop food.

256
00:19:13,148 --> 00:19:17,403
All right, we gotta get some food.
But next week, we can do it.

257
00:19:17,468 --> 00:19:19,257
No, I cannot let you fly now.

258
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:22,172
I cannot let you.
I cannot give you my plane.

259
00:19:22,236 --> 00:19:24,374
What are you doing
with these flowers each day?

260
00:19:24,444 --> 00:19:28,984
Because God give me, God tell me,
"Give flowers and you get love."

261
00:19:29,052 --> 00:19:32,597
"Love with flowers,
you will be good and great."

262
00:19:32,668 --> 00:19:35,352
Yes, but you're in love with whom?

263
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:39,478
With the whole world.
Peace and love, that we say.

264
00:19:39,548 --> 00:19:42,101
But I know you are waiting for your wife.
Tell it.

265
00:19:42,172 --> 00:19:45,685
- Yes.
- Yes, I know. I can see in your heart.

266
00:19:45,756 --> 00:19:49,204
<i>- You're waiting for your wife.
- The dollar say, "In God we trust," amigo.</i>

267
00:19:49,276 --> 00:19:51,545
Yes, but why did she leave you?
Why did she go?

268
00:19:51,612 --> 00:19:54,001
- She don't leave me.
- She left you.

269
00:19:54,076 --> 00:19:57,043
You are here for two years now.
Why did she leave you?

270
00:19:57,116 --> 00:20:00,465
- And she got the kids.
- Why did she leave and go with the kids?

271
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:02,809
Because I was too great,
too intelligent and...

272
00:20:02,876 --> 00:20:05,876
No, no, no, no. You did it to other women.
You were sinning.

273
00:20:05,948 --> 00:20:09,210
- No, sir! I never done nothing!
- My son, you were sinning.

274
00:20:09,276 --> 00:20:11,665
- I used to fix shoes...
- No, you were...

275
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:15,897
- I don't have no time for her.
- You sinned with other women. Confess.

276
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:18,037
- You did it to other women...
- Afterward...

277
00:20:18,108 --> 00:20:20,595
Yes, and that's why she left you.

278
00:20:20,668 --> 00:20:24,280
- No.
- Eugenio, my son, confess.

279
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:27,217
You did it to other women.
You sinned. Did you not?

280
00:20:27,292 --> 00:20:29,561
- Yeah.
- Yes, you did it. How many women?

281
00:20:29,628 --> 00:20:33,818
Five at least. I know you.
You look like that, yes.

282
00:20:33,884 --> 00:20:35,924
- You look like that.
- How you read me.

283
00:20:35,996 --> 00:20:41,080
- I read your heart, yes. I read your heart.
- But what matters is something after that.

284
00:20:41,147 --> 00:20:43,831
I give her everything,
I go and give her everything.

285
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:46,518
Then I go with the next woman
and I got my kids.

286
00:20:46,588 --> 00:20:50,745
Yes, but they will not return
until you go the path of the Lord.

287
00:20:50,812 --> 00:20:54,423
In the name of the Father
and the Holy Ghost,

288
00:20:54,492 --> 00:20:58,321
oh, God, mercy,
take care of me where I go.

289
00:21:00,956 --> 00:21:02,930
I absolve you of your sins.

290
00:21:03,004 --> 00:21:05,208
Stand up.

291
00:21:05,276 --> 00:21:08,659
So, you will not sin anymore.

292
00:21:08,732 --> 00:21:11,929
Go home and you will come back
with new flowers tomorrow.

293
00:21:11,996 --> 00:21:14,778
- I will give you the flowers.
- Thank you very much, yes.

294
00:21:14,844 --> 00:21:17,779
I will give it to the sisters.
They will enjoy it.

295
00:21:17,852 --> 00:21:21,201
- The sisters, they live in chastity...
- Yes.

296
00:21:21,276 --> 00:21:23,731
...but you don't.
- OK.

297
00:21:23,804 --> 00:21:27,578
And that's why your wife has left you,
and you will not do it again.

298
00:21:27,644 --> 00:21:28,920
- OK.
- Yes.

299
00:21:28,988 --> 00:21:31,956
- But she love me.
- Yes, and you love her?

300
00:21:32,027 --> 00:21:34,002
- Mm-hm.
- You love her dearly?

301
00:21:34,076 --> 00:21:38,069
- Mm-hm.
- So, just be a better man.

302
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:40,988
I know in your heart you are a good man.

303
00:21:44,476 --> 00:21:45,905
- OK?
- Yeah.

304
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:48,663
- We're done then?
- Yes, and I keep the flowers.

305
00:21:48,732 --> 00:21:52,693
I gotta tell you something. You keep
the flowers and you take my daughters,

306
00:21:52,764 --> 00:21:55,513
kiss them and tell them I love them,
you get me?

307
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,173
- Yes.
- OK?

308
00:21:57,243 --> 00:22:00,211
Yeah, when I'm flying to Los Angeles
where she is, or where...

309
00:22:00,284 --> 00:22:02,585
Do you know where she is?

310
00:22:02,652 --> 00:22:07,638
I will tell them to return and I will tell them
that you are not sinning anymore.

311
00:22:07,708 --> 00:22:11,417
OK, my son.
You're a good man, I know.

312
00:22:11,484 --> 00:22:14,801
You don't have to cry.
The Lord is with you.

313
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:17,723
<i>OK, sisters,
the cardboard boxes first.</i>

314
00:22:17,788 --> 00:22:19,959
Yes, put them right there.

315
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:23,896
Move this here. Yeah, the rice bags,
I need the rice bags.

316
00:22:23,964 --> 00:22:27,379
This here goes close to the door, yes.

317
00:22:27,452 --> 00:22:29,819
Put it close. This goes first.

318
00:22:29,883 --> 00:22:33,495
And don't drop it over Zapaxa,
don't drop it over Shazuta.

319
00:22:33,564 --> 00:22:37,339
You wait for Puerto Escondido,
you wait for my signal.

320
00:22:37,404 --> 00:22:40,339
And this goes close to the exit.
Close to the exit.

321
00:22:40,412 --> 00:22:43,707
How many of you are going?
How much place do we have?

322
00:22:43,772 --> 00:22:45,365
Three... three spaces.

323
00:22:45,436 --> 00:22:48,535
So it's you, Sister, you, and you.

324
00:22:48,604 --> 00:22:51,670
You will go on the plane
and you will do it.

325
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:54,326
You will be onboard.
Where's the third?

326
00:22:54,396 --> 00:22:57,330
Ah, you are already...
Yes, you stay onboard.

327
00:22:57,404 --> 00:23:00,154
And you wait for my signal.
You wait, you wait.

328
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:02,489
Don't drop it over
the first or second village.

329
00:23:02,556 --> 00:23:05,556
Over Puerto Escondido,
and I'm gonna give the signal.

330
00:23:05,628 --> 00:23:07,057
Sisters, good luck.

331
00:23:07,132 --> 00:23:08,920
- Sisters, goodbye.
- Bye.

332
00:23:08,987 --> 00:23:13,843
I'll see you, but step back from the wing,
step back from the wing! We are gonna fly.

333
00:23:13,916 --> 00:23:16,698
- Sisters, are you ready?
- Yes, Father.

334
00:23:16,764 --> 00:23:19,993
- Ready all the time?
- Yes, Father, always.

335
00:23:20,059 --> 00:23:22,645
- Ready with the Lord?
- Yes, amen.

336
00:24:50,395 --> 00:24:51,988
There is the village.

337
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:54,930
There is the village coming!
The village is right down there!

338
00:24:55,003 --> 00:24:58,135
Hold on, hold on, wait for my signal!

339
00:24:58,204 --> 00:24:59,960
I'm turning once more around!

340
00:25:00,028 --> 00:25:01,937
Turn around!

341
00:25:05,147 --> 00:25:07,449
Hang on, Sisters! Hang on!

342
00:25:07,516 --> 00:25:09,883
Get ready now! Get ready!

343
00:25:10,459 --> 00:25:12,598
Wait for my signal!

344
00:25:13,564 --> 00:25:15,538
Now! Drop it now!

345
00:25:15,611 --> 00:25:19,540
Rice. Yes, yes, faster.
Rice first, yes!

346
00:25:19,611 --> 00:25:23,354
Drop it! Bring it down,
they are waiting for it! They are hungry!

347
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:27,217
Wait, wait...
Yes! Drop it, toss it down!

348
00:25:27,291 --> 00:25:29,626
Down, down, down!

349
00:25:29,692 --> 00:25:31,601
<i>Aargh!</i>

350
00:26:13,115 --> 00:26:17,109
<i>Oh, Lord, do not let me die.</i>

351
00:26:17,948 --> 00:26:20,534
<i>I believe, oh, Lord.</i>

352
00:26:20,604 --> 00:26:22,840
<i>Let me fall safe.</i>

353
00:26:23,771 --> 00:26:25,397
<i>I believe in you.</i>

<i>I fear nothing.</i>

355
00:26:27,259 --> 00:26:30,423
<i>For you are always with me,</i>

356
00:26:30,491 --> 00:26:35,193
<i>and it is your will that I shall fly.</i>

357
00:27:44,284 --> 00:27:47,350
Hey! Hey!

358
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:51,064
<i>Hey! I'm home!</i>

I found a Michael!

365

<i>Surprise!</i>

366
00:28:23,867 --> 00:28:25,776
I'm back!

367
00:28:27,804 --> 00:28:30,171
- Hey!
- Welcome back!

368
00:28:30,235 --> 00:28:31,828
I found a Michael!

369
00:28:34,139 --> 00:28:36,823
I found a Michael!

370
00:28:40,732 --> 00:28:43,928
- Where'd you find him, in Paris?
- What a surprise!

371

My, it's good to be alive!

386
00:30:32,379 --> 00:30:33,972
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

387
00:30:34,043 --> 00:30:38,386
The mountains and the trees
and the sea and the breeze.

388
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:41,078
Wonderful.
The clouds touching the mountain.

389
00:30:41,147 --> 00:30:43,056
They all join into... Oh...

390

<i>Hey-hey, Michael! Beautiful day!</i>

395
00:31:09,084 --> 00:31:12,379
Hey, what is this, fellas, a monastery?
Come on, let's get busy!

396
00:31:12,443 --> 00:31:16,404
We gotta get this thing finished.
I'm trusting you.

397
00:31:24,892 --> 00:31:28,088
<i>Hey, come on, Jimmy!
You're the laziest bastard here!</i>

398
00:31:28,155 --> 00:31:32,345
It's not so hard, man!
Two legs is chicken, four legs is sheep.

00:31:32,411 --> 00:31:34,451
Jesus Christ!

400

<i>Abe, if you'd stop shouting for a
second, I could get some work done here.</i>

And get these fucking animals
down the fucking hill!

- Get 'em down the fucking hill!

<i>- Hey, Michael.
- Hola.</i>

404
00:32:23,803 --> 00:32:25,396
Hello.

405
00:32:27,259 --> 00:32:29,168
Cluck-cluck-cluck.

406
00:32:30,267 --> 00:32:34,097
- What?
- Cluck-cluck, cluck, cluck-cluck-cluck.

407
00:32:37,467 --> 00:32:39,889
Are you a chicken?

408
00:32:44,187 --> 00:32:47,383
Listen, I love the chicken
more than anything in the whole world,

409
00:32:47,452 --> 00:32:49,939
but I think she's pregnant.

410
00:32:50,011 --> 00:32:51,921
Really?

411
00:32:51,995 --> 00:32:53,424
Really.

412
00:32:54,299 --> 00:32:58,041
- Do you know the father?
- Yeah, but I think they just got divorced.

413
00:33:00,731 --> 00:33:02,324
OK.

414
00:33:03,291 --> 00:33:05,974
And what, you're like the stepfather?

415
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:08,659
Yep, I take real care of it.

416
00:33:09,692 --> 00:33:13,488
I'm the best stepdad
she's ever gonna have and ever will have.

417
00:33:16,156 --> 00:33:17,432
All right.

418
00:33:17,499 --> 00:33:19,474
Well, nice to meet you.

419
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:22,169
Nice to meet you too.

420
00:33:22,235 --> 00:33:23,347
Cluck-cluck!

421
00:33:23,484 --> 00:33:25,393
<i>Cluck-cluck!</i>

422
00:33:25,467 --> 00:33:28,816
<i>He makes me laugh when he does that.</i>

423
00:33:28,892 --> 00:33:33,048
- Does he think he's really a chicken?
- I don't know why he likes being a chicken,

424
00:33:33,115 --> 00:33:39,956
but I think it's because he just likes the way
chickens live and he wants to be a chicken.

425
00:33:40,027 --> 00:33:44,762
It's just like, a bit like,
if I really liked, maybe, a dolphin

426
00:33:44,827 --> 00:33:50,904
and I really wanted to be a dolphin, so that
I could see how the dolphin's life worked.

427
00:33:50,972 --> 00:33:52,881
Maybe it's just like that.

428
00:33:55,387 --> 00:33:58,802
<i>Now I'm 9'7"!</i>

429
00:34:00,827 --> 00:34:05,464
<i>- Stop showing me your ass.
- Oh, man, this is beautiful.</i>

430
00:34:05,531 --> 00:34:07,800
<i>- I want a drink.
- It's the Grand Canyon.</i>

431
00:34:07,867 --> 00:34:10,518
<i>- You want a drink?
- Give me your toe.</i>

432
00:34:10,587 --> 00:34:13,336
<i>Give me your toe!
# This little piggy...</i>

433
00:34:18,812 --> 00:34:22,008
<i>Michael?
A little toke on that, Michael?</i>

434
00:34:22,075 --> 00:34:24,945
- Thank you very much.
- Don't let your mother catch you!

435
00:34:29,819 --> 00:34:30,768
Bleurgh!

436
00:34:30,843 --> 00:34:34,421
<i>- What happened?
- Like everything, it went out of style.</i>

437
00:34:34,491 --> 00:34:36,563
<i>- Not for me.
- Not for you?</i>

438
00:34:36,635 --> 00:34:39,864
<i>None for Little Red Riding Hood.</i>

439
00:34:39,932 --> 00:34:44,307
<i>- Yeah, man.
- OK, if you say so.</i>

440
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:46,649
<i>Here...</i>

441
00:34:46,715 --> 00:34:51,090
<i>- Are you sure you're old enough to drink?
- Ah, he's one of us.</i>

442
00:34:51,163 --> 00:34:55,636
<i>- So what do you think, Michael?
- I like the mud.</i>

443
00:34:55,707 --> 00:34:58,424
<i>He likes the mud!</i>

444
00:34:58,491 --> 00:35:00,946
Ladies and gentlemen, I propose a toast.

445

00:35:07,963 --> 00:35:09,719
Three cheers for Michael!

451
00:35:17,083 --> 00:35:19,636
<i>- Speech, speech!
- No, no.</i>

452
00:35:19,707 --> 00:35:22,674
<i>- Yeah.
- Or give us a song.</i>

453
00:35:22,747 --> 00:35:25,943
- No, no, I'd rather give a speech.
- A speech?

454
00:35:26,012 --> 00:35:28,695
- We love you, Michael.
- You're welcome here.

455

- Yeah.

Ha-ha! 14 to 2!

462
00:35:54,747 --> 00:35:56,176

Ah... 15 to 2!

464
00:36:00,635 --> 00:36:04,563
You know that the point of this game
is to hit the ball back to me, no?

465
00:36:04,635 --> 00:36:06,326
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

466
00:36:07,707 --> 00:36:11,700
- But you hit it too fast for me.
- 16 to 2. Yes.

467
00:36:11,771 --> 00:36:15,087
I always hit the ball fast.
Always good at this.

468
00:36:17,627 --> 00:36:18,772
Oh!

469
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:23,186
I used to play all sports, when I was young.
I used to be a gymnast.

470
00:36:23,259 --> 00:36:24,569
- Really?
- Yeah.

471
00:36:27,387 --> 00:36:32,122
As a boy, I could put both legs behind
my head and balance on one finger.

472
00:36:32,187 --> 00:36:35,668
- No way.
- Yeah! I won always at contests.

473
00:36:35,739 --> 00:36:37,649
I never lose, you know?

474
00:36:37,723 --> 00:36:40,308
- 19 to 2, I think, yeah?
- Yeah.

475
00:36:40,379 --> 00:36:44,308
You have problems with your hands,
Michael?

476
00:36:44,379 --> 00:36:46,354
- No.
- Something's wrong with you.

477
00:36:46,427 --> 00:36:48,499
No, no, no, I'm just having fun.

478
00:36:48,571 --> 00:36:52,183
- Did you play sports? Basketball?
- No.

479
00:36:52,251 --> 00:36:55,513
- Why?
- No, I was never really good at anything.

480
00:36:55,579 --> 00:36:59,289
Why not? You are strong.
You are a good dancer.

481
00:36:59,931 --> 00:37:03,193
Well, I don't know. Everyone
seemed to be better than me.

482
00:37:03,259 --> 00:37:06,936
<i>- Even the girls.
- You are too nice, I think.</i>

483
00:37:07,003 --> 00:37:08,913
- Go.
- I'm gonna beat you.

484
00:37:09,787 --> 00:37:11,609
Be careful.

485
00:37:12,411 --> 00:37:15,575
<i>Yeah! 21 to 2!</i>

486
00:37:15,643 --> 00:37:17,236
I win!

487
00:37:17,307 --> 00:37:19,478
<i>Yeah.</i>

488
00:37:20,859 --> 00:37:22,518
I mean, good.

489
00:37:23,803 --> 00:37:27,032
- Congratulations.
- Ah...

490
00:37:27,099 --> 00:37:30,295
Serious. You are too nice.

491
00:37:30,363 --> 00:37:33,778
If I lose, I wouldn't talk to you for a week.

492
00:37:33,851 --> 00:37:35,673
Really?

493
00:37:35,739 --> 00:37:38,772
- You want to play again?
- No.

494
00:37:38,843 --> 00:37:43,316
No, no, it's too cold for me anyway.
But thank you.

495
00:37:43,387 --> 00:37:45,362
You're welcome.

496
00:37:46,203 --> 00:37:48,210
I love women.

497
00:37:48,283 --> 00:37:52,342
They're hot. They make me sweat.

498
00:37:53,307 --> 00:37:55,608
I love chickens.

499
00:37:55,674 --> 00:37:58,871
I love their wings, like breasts.

500
00:37:58,939 --> 00:38:04,154
If you combine chicken with a woman's
breasts, you get chicken breasts.

501
00:38:04,219 --> 00:38:07,088
I like chicken breast.

502
00:38:07,163 --> 00:38:10,545
Chicken breast is nice...

503
00:38:10,619 --> 00:38:12,529
and hot!

504
00:38:13,179 --> 00:38:15,219
If it was up to me,

505
00:38:15,291 --> 00:38:21,041
I'd make the world
naked woman and naked chickens.

506
00:38:21,115 --> 00:38:24,082
That's hot, yeah.

507
00:38:24,155 --> 00:38:26,359
I love women.

508
00:38:26,427 --> 00:38:29,144
They are so... They make me sweat.

509
00:38:29,211 --> 00:38:31,350
I love chickens.

510
00:38:31,419 --> 00:38:33,044
Ahh...

511
00:38:33,114 --> 00:38:38,166
Their breasts are so smooth, yeah.

512
00:38:42,395 --> 00:38:44,468
<i>Looks healthy.</i>

513
00:38:44,539 --> 00:38:46,448
It's nearly dead.

514
00:38:47,995 --> 00:38:51,923
I know it's nearly dead,
but it still looks healthy to me.

515
00:38:51,995 --> 00:38:55,029
It was healthy, it was young, it was fed.

516
00:38:58,299 --> 00:39:00,306
What do you think?

517
00:39:00,379 --> 00:39:02,681
I don't fucking know.

518
00:39:02,747 --> 00:39:06,806
I guess we ought to check the others.
Here, give me...

519
00:39:11,770 --> 00:39:14,356
What do you want me to do,
take its fucking pulse?

520
00:39:14,427 --> 00:39:17,296
I look like a fucking vet?
Give it fucking mouth-to-mouth?

521
00:39:17,371 --> 00:39:19,859
Come on, let's check the others.

522
00:39:26,235 --> 00:39:28,504
<i>- Grab that one!
- Come here!</i>

523
00:39:28,571 --> 00:39:30,480
<i>Grab any one!</i>

524
00:39:37,307 --> 00:39:39,925
<i>Dear world...</i>

525
00:39:39,995 --> 00:39:42,842
<i>Dear world and everyone in it,</i>

526
00:39:42,907 --> 00:39:47,696
<i>I have noticed that over the years
you have tried to pass me by.</i>

527
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:50,870
<i>I have noticed that
you think I'm very strange,</i>

528
00:39:50,939 --> 00:39:54,452
<i>and the way I think
you might consider it to be wrong.</i>

529
00:39:56,186 --> 00:39:59,220
<i>Dear world and everyone in it...</i>

530
00:39:59,899 --> 00:40:03,794
<i>from the moment I was born,
I remember feeling different.</i>

531
00:40:03,866 --> 00:40:06,419
<i>I remember thinking
I had a special kind of vision</i>

532
00:40:06,490 --> 00:40:10,385
<i>that allowed me to see things
that you couldn't see.</i>

533
00:40:10,459 --> 00:40:13,808
<i>I don't think I ever felt the same
as you felt and...</i>

534
00:40:13,883 --> 00:40:18,487
<i>I'm not exactly angry about it,
it just seems that's the way things are.</i>

535
00:40:18,555 --> 00:40:23,509
<i>I have to admit that I have spent
the majority of my life feeling confused,</i>

536
00:40:23,579 --> 00:40:26,034
<i>feeling alien and disconnected.</i>

537
00:40:26,875 --> 00:40:29,973
<i>Never getting things the way
it seems everyone else gets them</i>

538
00:40:30,043 --> 00:40:33,010
<i>or understanding things exactly.</i>

539
00:40:36,411 --> 00:40:38,800
<i>Dear world...</i>

540
00:40:38,874 --> 00:40:41,362
<i>Dear world and everyone in it...</i>

541
00:40:42,811 --> 00:40:45,528
<i>It's hard to always laugh</i>

542
00:40:45,594 --> 00:40:49,107
when you don't know
what people find so funny.

543
00:40:55,706 --> 00:40:57,616
<i>You are a slut.</i>

544
00:41:00,187 --> 00:41:02,097
Yes?

545
00:41:03,579 --> 00:41:05,489
No.

546
00:41:11,195 --> 00:41:13,104
Did you fuck him?

547
00:41:15,835 --> 00:41:17,777
No.

548
00:41:17,851 --> 00:41:19,760
Yes.

549
00:41:21,370 --> 00:41:22,647
No.

550
00:41:24,987 --> 00:41:26,896
Why is he here?

551
00:41:29,819 --> 00:41:31,728
Because.

552
00:41:35,291 --> 00:41:37,200
You asked him to come?

553
00:41:38,939 --> 00:41:40,848
Yes...

554
00:41:46,395 --> 00:41:48,304
- What?
- Please...

555
00:41:49,914 --> 00:41:52,151
Please stop, please stop.

556
00:41:52,219 --> 00:41:54,488
If I smell my finger,

557
00:41:54,555 --> 00:41:56,464
will I smell him?

558
00:42:07,771 --> 00:42:09,680
You know I love you.

559
00:42:11,611 --> 00:42:14,294
You are the most beautiful person.

560
00:42:17,851 --> 00:42:19,761
I had a dream.

561
00:42:21,371 --> 00:42:23,607
It was a strange dream.

562
00:42:25,467 --> 00:42:27,703
You killed me in the dream.

563
00:42:29,882 --> 00:42:34,552
You stood above me,
waiting for me to die.

564
00:42:35,898 --> 00:42:39,990
You said, "Everything will be OK, Charlie."

565
00:42:40,059 --> 00:42:43,058
"Everything will be good now."

566
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:45,040
"I promise, Charlie."

567
00:42:46,939 --> 00:42:49,427
And then you said,

568
00:42:49,498 --> 00:42:51,408
"Go with God."

569
00:42:53,563 --> 00:42:58,964
I was curious because you know
I don't believe in such things.

570
00:42:59,034 --> 00:43:01,587
But it was comforting to me.

571
00:43:07,322 --> 00:43:09,711
- You know, Charlie...
- Hmm?

572
00:43:12,186 --> 00:43:14,575
Sometimes when I look at you...

573
00:43:17,147 --> 00:43:21,303
you seem more like Adolf Hitler
than Charlie Chaplin.

574
00:44:52,699 --> 00:44:56,015
<i>Who are these men
dressed like this?</i>

575
00:44:56,922 --> 00:45:00,305
Are they afraid of these little lambs?

576
00:45:01,274 --> 00:45:06,163
I have known these lambs for many years
and they have not hurt me!

577
00:45:08,794 --> 00:45:13,072
Perhaps you should be dressed like this
on the moon.

578
00:45:14,202 --> 00:45:17,104
These lambs are not from outer space.

579
00:45:17,178 --> 00:45:22,481
They are poor, lowly, lowly animals,
for Christ's sake.

580
00:45:27,867 --> 00:45:34,195
Do they not know their little arms
are too short to box with God?

581
00:45:58,714 --> 00:46:06,549
<i># What a friend
we have in Jesus</i>

582
00:46:06,619 --> 00:46:13,329
<i># All our sins and greeds to bear</i>

583
00:46:14,170 --> 00:46:22,070
<i># What a privilege to carry</i>

584
00:46:22,139 --> 00:46:25,270
<i># Everything to God...</i>

585
00:46:25,338 --> 00:46:26,712
No.

586
00:46:26,779 --> 00:46:28,437
- Yes.
- No!

587
00:46:28,507 --> 00:46:29,816
Yes!

588
00:46:33,851 --> 00:46:35,989
- No... no!
- Please! Please!

589
00:46:36,058 --> 00:46:38,611
No, tart! Tart, no!

590
00:46:38,682 --> 00:46:41,813
No! No!

591
00:46:41,882 --> 00:46:43,311
No!

592
00:46:44,282 --> 00:46:51,669
<i>#... take it to the Lord in prayer</i>

593
00:46:51,739 --> 00:46:59,191
<i># Can you find a friend so faithful</i>

594
00:46:59,258 --> 00:47:06,296
<i># Who will all your sorrows share?</i>

595
00:47:07,163 --> 00:47:14,615

00:47:14,683 --> 00:47:18,294
<i># Thou will find...</i>

597
00:47:18,362 --> 00:47:25,815
<i>#... our solace there #</i>

598
00:47:27,706 --> 00:47:30,489
<i>Oh, no, that's terrible news.</i>

599
00:47:31,163 --> 00:47:34,424
Are you sure there's not been
some mistake?

600
00:47:34,491 --> 00:47:36,214
Hmm...

601
00:47:36,282 --> 00:47:38,584
OK, so what options do we have?

602
00:47:39,451 --> 00:47:40,978
Mm-hm.

603
00:47:41,050 --> 00:47:43,352
And there's no way to treat it?

604
00:47:44,955 --> 00:47:47,988
<i>What, even those that are not infected?</i>

605
00:47:49,210 --> 00:47:53,552
Do you have any concept
of how valuable these beasts are?

606
00:47:55,355 --> 00:47:59,795
No, no, no, no, no, you will not do it.
We will do it ourselves, thank you.

607
00:47:59,866 --> 00:48:03,641
Stop, stop.
I said we will do it ourselves.

608
00:48:03,706 --> 00:48:05,713
It's the right thing to do.

609
00:48:07,066 --> 00:48:08,976
Yes, I give you my word.

610
00:49:14,778 --> 00:49:17,167
<i>Yeah, I'm...</i>

611
00:49:17,754 --> 00:49:19,664
Come on in.

612
00:49:25,051 --> 00:49:26,676
- Hello.
- Hey.

613
00:49:26,746 --> 00:49:28,273
Good morning.

614
00:49:28,410 --> 00:49:30,320
Good morning.

615
00:49:31,066 --> 00:49:34,928
- I brought you some strawberries.
- Oh, thank you.

616
00:49:35,738 --> 00:49:37,942
That's really nice, thanks.

617
00:49:47,898 --> 00:49:49,807
What's this?

618
00:49:50,682 --> 00:49:52,591
It's a recorder.

619
00:49:55,290 --> 00:49:56,883
Why?

620
00:49:56,954 --> 00:49:58,864
"Why" what?

621
00:49:59,707 --> 00:50:02,128
Why do you need to record things?

622
00:50:03,162 --> 00:50:06,511
Oh, it's just something I do, you know?

623
00:50:09,178 --> 00:50:11,087
When I write songs...

624
00:50:11,802 --> 00:50:15,031
or when I see something beautiful.

625
00:50:17,754 --> 00:50:21,845
I talk into it, mostly, or read from books,
just to remember things.

626
00:50:22,234 --> 00:50:24,176
Like what?

627
00:50:24,250 --> 00:50:27,250
People... stories, mainly.

628
00:50:29,530 --> 00:50:33,970
I always felt like
life moves too quickly,

629
00:50:34,042 --> 00:50:36,824
and this is my attempt at slowing it.

630
00:50:37,914 --> 00:50:40,401
I get to keep the days with me...

631
00:50:41,274 --> 00:50:44,056
get to keep the people I meet with me.

632
00:50:45,242 --> 00:50:47,151
Otherwise, they all leave me.

633
00:51:01,562 --> 00:51:03,667
The sheep have to be killed.

634
00:51:05,146 --> 00:51:07,382
Those people said they're diseased.

635
00:51:07,450 --> 00:51:09,043
What?

636
00:51:12,058 --> 00:51:13,651
All of them?

637
00:51:13,722 --> 00:51:15,730
Yeah, all of them.

638
00:51:15,803 --> 00:51:18,039
They all have to be killed.

639
00:51:18,939 --> 00:51:20,051
Whoa.

640
00:51:20,122 --> 00:51:22,610
It's easy to get sick these days.

641
00:51:32,762 --> 00:51:35,031
Do you ever talk about me?

642
00:51:36,186 --> 00:51:37,779
When?

643
00:51:38,714 --> 00:51:40,340
In your recorder.

644
00:51:41,402 --> 00:51:43,191
Oh.

645
00:51:43,258 --> 00:51:44,851
Yeah.

646
00:51:46,074 --> 00:51:48,943
Yeah, sometimes.

647
00:51:51,002 --> 00:51:52,912
What do you say?

648
00:51:54,459 --> 00:51:56,695
<i>I don't know.</i>

649
00:51:58,618 --> 00:52:00,527
Different things.

650
00:52:01,658 --> 00:52:03,568
It depends.

651
00:52:05,658 --> 00:52:07,284
Oops...

652
00:52:07,354 --> 00:52:09,263
Sorry.

653
00:52:25,082 --> 00:52:26,991
I hope they're good.

654
00:52:29,722 --> 00:52:31,217
What?

655
00:52:31,290 --> 00:52:33,679
The things you say about me.

656
00:52:37,402 --> 00:52:39,312
Mmm...

657
00:53:04,410 --> 00:53:06,417
<i>Viva la fresa.</i>

658
00:54:02,042 --> 00:54:04,376
I never...

659
00:54:05,114 --> 00:54:07,962
I never would act...

660
00:54:10,074 --> 00:54:13,718
I never... I never would...

661
00:54:13,786 --> 00:54:19,220
It going,
it going to be OK, OK, OK.

662
00:54:20,250 --> 00:54:22,159
It going to be OK.

663
00:54:23,770 --> 00:54:25,908
The pretty girl...

664
00:54:26,042 --> 00:54:27,951
The pretty girl...

665
00:54:30,138 --> 00:54:33,651
Pleased to meet you.
Pleased to meet you, too.

666
00:54:34,202 --> 00:54:35,828
What are you doing?

667
00:54:35,898 --> 00:54:37,174
What do you do?

668
00:54:37,242 --> 00:54:39,631
What do you know how to do?

669
00:54:40,314 --> 00:54:43,478
Sheep...
Mmm, sheep!

670
00:54:43,546 --> 00:54:46,862
Sheep, sheep, sheep, sheep,

671
00:54:46,938 --> 00:54:50,287
sheep, sheep, sheep...

672
00:54:51,002 --> 00:54:53,368
Shit, shit.

673
00:54:53,434 --> 00:54:54,960
Fuck.

674
00:54:55,034 --> 00:54:57,816
Fucking government. Fuck!

675
00:54:58,746 --> 00:55:02,291
Fucking government. Fuck! Bullshit!

676
00:55:02,970 --> 00:55:05,840
Bullshit, bullshit!

677
00:55:07,930 --> 00:55:09,839
What's, uh...

678
00:55:10,746 --> 00:55:14,608
How, how old...
How old are you?

679
00:55:15,994 --> 00:55:19,442
I'm... 34.

680
00:55:20,794 --> 00:55:23,860
Mmm, perhaps 35.

681
00:55:24,890 --> 00:55:29,145
My life, my life, it's...

682
00:55:29,210 --> 00:55:32,854
My life, it don't count for nothing.

683
00:55:47,610 --> 00:55:51,887
I would like to speak for a moment here.
I would like to propose a toast.

684
00:55:51,962 --> 00:55:53,871
<i>A toast.</i>

685
00:55:55,642 --> 00:55:59,155
To the dreams we dream, my friends.

686
00:55:59,226 --> 00:56:02,095
Oh, yeah.
Hear! Hear!

687
00:56:02,170 --> 00:56:04,690
<i>Yes, dreams.</i>

688
00:56:04,762 --> 00:56:08,537
To the dreams who make us who we are.

689
00:56:08,602 --> 00:56:12,661
To the dreams that allow us
to find one another,

690
00:56:12,730 --> 00:56:16,723
to seek refuge
and to pause for comfort.

691
00:56:18,234 --> 00:56:20,176
I'm not stupid,

692
00:56:20,250 --> 00:56:22,486
and I'm an old man.

693
00:56:22,553 --> 00:56:25,782
But I know that I'm not like everybody else.

694
00:56:25,850 --> 00:56:30,552
And everyone in this room
is not like everybody else.

695
00:56:30,618 --> 00:56:33,465
<i>But the good thing is</i>

696
00:56:33,530 --> 00:56:39,443
that we have found one another and
we have become what we wish we were.

697
00:56:40,154 --> 00:56:44,758
And I say this tonight because, you know,

698
00:56:44,826 --> 00:56:47,063
our sheep have fallen ill.

699
00:56:47,930 --> 00:56:52,436
<i>Those gentle creatures
who provide so much for us</i>

700
00:56:52,506 --> 00:56:54,895
and ask for so little in return.

701
00:56:57,562 --> 00:57:03,029
These sheep did not have the choice
to be human as we are.

702
00:57:03,098 --> 00:57:05,170
They are simply sheep.

703
00:57:05,242 --> 00:57:08,276
They cannot choose to do what we do.

704
00:57:09,658 --> 00:57:13,880
And so tonight, my friends,
I propose that we should get drunk

705
00:57:13,945 --> 00:57:19,128
on behalf of our fallen comrades in
the pastures whose lives shall soon cease.

706
00:57:22,266 --> 00:57:25,048
To the dreams that propel us.

707
00:57:25,530 --> 00:57:29,304
To the dreams that keep us well.

708
00:57:30,330 --> 00:57:35,894
And finally, to the dreams that unite us
here, tonight, with each other.

709
00:57:38,553 --> 00:57:40,528
To our sheep!

710
00:57:40,602 --> 00:57:43,220
<i>To our sheep!</i>

711
00:57:43,674 --> 00:57:45,583
To our sheep.

712
00:57:50,906 --> 00:57:54,102

<i>Sisters, I know
this might sound ridiculous,</i>

747
01:01:04,793 --> 01:01:07,182
but the Lord wants to test us.

748
01:01:07,258 --> 01:01:11,087
The Lord wants us
to jump out of an aeroplane,

749
01:01:11,161 --> 01:01:13,071
without a parachute!

750
01:01:13,145 --> 01:01:15,447
He wants to see us fly.

751
01:01:15,513 --> 01:01:19,921
He wants to see us
dance through the sky and do tricks,

752
01:01:19,994 --> 01:01:26,323
show the world there are miracles,
there are miracles to happen to everybody.

753
01:01:26,394 --> 01:01:28,663
If you're pure enough,

754
01:01:28,730 --> 01:01:31,185
if you believe enough,

755
01:01:31,258 --> 01:01:33,713
Sisters, believe me,

756
01:01:33,786 --> 01:01:35,695
you will fly.

757
01:01:37,337 --> 01:01:42,422
We here in the broken nation
are tired and bruised.

758
01:01:42,489 --> 01:01:45,523
We have been left here alone with nothing.

759
01:01:45,594 --> 01:01:47,960
We have been abandoned.

760
01:01:48,026 --> 01:01:52,084
We are like vomit in the street
outside of a seedy bar.

761
01:01:52,761 --> 01:01:57,017
We have been relegated
to the bottom of the barrel

762
01:01:57,082 --> 01:02:02,352
and all our senses of understanding
and love seem gone forever.

763
01:02:04,217 --> 01:02:09,171
In order to survive here,
we have to become like animals...

764
01:02:10,266 --> 01:02:15,219
and we have to fore go
all sense of civility and understanding.

765
01:02:17,082 --> 01:02:19,864
How is it possible that a nun can fly?

766
01:02:20,666 --> 01:02:26,743
How is it possible that she falls
out of a plane and lands unscathed?

767
01:02:27,546 --> 01:02:32,303
But who are we...
who are we to scoff at such things?

768
01:02:32,377 --> 01:02:34,963
Who are we to doubt such miracles?

769
01:02:35,961 --> 01:02:40,118
Alas, we are but tramps in the gutter,

770
01:02:40,185 --> 01:02:42,519
here in the broken nation.

771
01:02:42,585 --> 01:02:46,415
But a little faith
can take us a long, long way.

772
01:02:48,473 --> 01:02:50,895
<i>If you're pure enough,</i>

773
01:02:50,969 --> 01:02:53,206
<i>if you believe enough,</i>

774
01:02:53,273 --> 01:02:55,695
<i>Sisters, believe me,</i>

775
01:02:55,769 --> 01:02:57,842
<i>you will fly.</i>

776
01:02:57,914 --> 01:03:00,402
<i>God will be your parachute.</i>

777
01:03:00,473 --> 01:03:04,630
<i>You will experience the miracle
that I have felt.</i>

778
01:05:46,329 --> 01:05:48,784
<i>Come on, move your ass!</i>

779
01:05:48,857 --> 01:05:50,929
This should be ready for June!

780
01:05:51,001 --> 01:05:54,482
This is going to be
the greatest fucking show on earth!

781
01:06:00,441 --> 01:06:02,034
Let's go! Let's go!

782
01:06:02,105 --> 01:06:04,015
Out of the stage!

783
01:06:06,297 --> 01:06:08,719
<i>Mind where you put
the fucking brush!</i>

784
01:06:08,793 --> 01:06:11,990
I told you not to let
the fucking Stooges in here!

785
01:06:12,057 --> 01:06:13,650
I said don't let the fucking...

786
01:06:13,721 --> 01:06:16,143
Do you know
what this fucking outfit cost me?

787
01:06:16,282 --> 01:06:18,583
Do you know
what this fucking outfit cost me?

788
01:06:21,561 --> 01:06:23,471
Abe, stop it!

789
01:06:29,305 --> 01:06:33,648
<i>- We'll never finish it.
- We will finish it, sweetie.</i>

790
01:06:33,721 --> 01:06:36,754
- It looks like shit.
- She's crying.

791
01:06:36,825 --> 01:06:39,476
<i>- I think we bet... I think, oh...
- Be quiet.</i>

792
01:06:39,545 --> 01:06:42,065
- Look what you did.
- Shut up!

793
01:06:42,137 --> 01:06:45,454
- He always does this.
- Paint all over the clothes!

794
01:06:45,529 --> 01:06:49,206
We have a performance
and no one's gonna come!

795
01:06:49,274 --> 01:06:53,551
It looks like shit,
and you guys can't get to work!

796
01:06:53,625 --> 01:06:55,599
<i>- You see?
- Fucking right.</i>

797
01:06:55,673 --> 01:06:57,746
<i>- Sorry.
- Tell the fucking Stooges.</i>

798
01:06:57,818 --> 01:06:59,760
No, I'm sorry, I just...

799
01:06:59,834 --> 01:07:01,743
It is not the Stooges' fault.

800
01:07:01,817 --> 01:07:06,192
We just have to focus and get it done.
We want people to come see us, right?

801
01:07:06,265 --> 01:07:07,988
<i>- Yeah.
- People will come.</i>

802
01:07:08,057 --> 01:07:12,759
People are gonna see this place
and... turn away, unless we work.

803
01:07:22,809 --> 01:07:26,192
It's going to be the greatest
fucking show on the earth!

804
01:07:26,265 --> 01:07:27,574
<i>Yeah!</i>

805
01:07:27,641 --> 01:07:32,310
It's going to be the greatest
fucking show on the earth!

806
01:07:32,441 --> 01:07:37,329
It's going to be the greatest
fucking show on the earth!

807
01:07:42,137 --> 01:07:45,552
Ladies and gentlemen,

808
01:07:45,625 --> 01:07:50,840
for one night only, we will be presenting
the greatest show on earth,

809
01:07:50,905 --> 01:07:53,971
the greatest show the world has ever seen!

810
01:07:54,041 --> 01:07:57,173
You're gonna have Michael Jackson.
Say hi, Mike.

811
01:07:57,241 --> 01:08:00,372
- Hey, hey, people!
- There you go.

812
01:08:00,441 --> 01:08:03,507
Jimmy Dean will be performing
for one night only.

813
01:08:03,577 --> 01:08:05,006
One night only, people.

814
01:08:05,081 --> 01:08:07,470
We've got Shirley Temple,
little Shirley Temple.

815
01:08:07,545 --> 01:08:10,741
She's four and she's gonna be
staying up late that night!

816
01:08:10,809 --> 01:08:15,959
We've got that little bundle of energy
Sammy Davis Jr!

817
01:08:16,025 --> 01:08:20,019
- Yee-hee!
- Come watch Sammy tear up the boards.

818
01:08:20,089 --> 01:08:21,976
We've got the human pincushion.

819
01:08:22,041 --> 01:08:24,856
- We've got the great disappearing lady.
- What?

820
01:08:24,921 --> 01:08:27,791
<i>This is a talent show
the likes of which</i>

821
01:08:27,865 --> 01:08:32,437
<i>you will never in your life
be privileged to see again. Trust me.</i>

822
01:08:32,505 --> 01:08:34,992
<i>Come out of your houses, people,
don't be shy.</i>

823
01:08:35,065 --> 01:08:38,414
<i>Come and join us,
visit our snack bar, if you will.</i>

824
01:08:38,489 --> 01:08:41,456
<i>Abraham Lincoln invites you to the show.</i>

825
01:08:41,529 --> 01:08:45,653
The greatest show on earth!

826
01:08:46,650 --> 01:08:49,683
Four score and seven years ago

827
01:08:49,753 --> 01:08:52,819
our fathers brought forth
upon this continent

828
01:08:52,889 --> 01:08:56,501
a new nation,
conceived in liberty

829
01:08:56,569 --> 01:09:02,198
and dedicated to the proposition
that all men are created equal.

830
01:09:18,521 --> 01:09:23,737
So, you think that the Stooges
should go on before Madonna?

831
01:09:23,801 --> 01:09:26,583
I just think that's gonna slow
everything down.

832
01:09:26,649 --> 01:09:30,610
The music is better that way.
The Rivaldi leads well.

833
01:09:30,681 --> 01:09:34,543
- Yeah, but it's gonna interrupt the flow.
- No.

834
01:09:34,617 --> 01:09:36,886
We've been through it. It'll be fine.

835
01:09:36,953 --> 01:09:41,012
Yeah, I know, I know, I know, but I'm just
fucking worried sick about this show.

836
01:09:41,081 --> 01:09:45,336
You've just gotta focus your energies
through your stomach.

837
01:09:53,881 --> 01:09:57,591
<i>The Pope stinks.
The Pope stinks.</i>

838
01:09:59,641 --> 01:10:02,543
The Pope stinks, the Pope stinks.

839
01:10:02,617 --> 01:10:06,392
- The Pope stinks.
- He's right, the Pope stinks.

840
01:10:06,457 --> 01:10:09,653
- I do bathe, I just don't use soap.
- The Pope stinks!

841
01:10:09,721 --> 01:10:12,688
- Ah, the Pope stinks.
- The Pope stinks.

842
01:10:12,761 --> 01:10:16,722
- The Pope stinks...
- I do bathe, I'm just allergic to soap.

843
01:10:16,793 --> 01:10:20,949
<i>The Pope stinks,
the Pope stinks, the Pope stinks...</i>

844
01:10:21,017 --> 01:10:24,530
Just leave me
so that I may remain in peace.

845
01:10:26,201 --> 01:10:31,635
<i>Leave me,
so that I may remain in peace.</i>

846
01:10:37,785 --> 01:10:40,021
<i>Oh, why?</i>

847
01:10:44,024 --> 01:10:45,934
Why?

848
01:10:49,017 --> 01:10:53,011
<i>Why, oh, why, oh, why?</i>

849
01:11:45,625 --> 01:11:49,367
<i>- Baby, don't let me fall asleep.
- Oh, don't worry, baby.</i>

850
01:11:49,433 --> 01:11:51,342
I don't wanna burn.

851
01:11:52,313 --> 01:11:56,175
It's OK. I don't let you burn.

852
01:11:56,249 --> 01:11:58,638
- I love you.
- Mmm, my baby.

853
01:12:06,105 --> 01:12:08,014
Be quiet.

854
01:13:48,248 --> 01:13:51,314
<i>In strict rotation...</i>

855
01:13:51,384 --> 01:13:52,661
Charlie!

856
01:13:52,729 --> 01:13:55,762
Charlie, why did you leave me?

857
01:13:57,177 --> 01:14:01,268
Charlie, l-I-I-I said please,
please don't let me fall asleep.

858
01:14:01,336 --> 01:14:04,784
Charlie, why did you leave me?

859
01:14:04,857 --> 01:14:07,159
<i>Charlie, I'm really burned.</i>

860
01:14:07,225 --> 01:14:10,934
She'll be fine.
Don't worry, it's just a sunburn.

861
01:14:11,001 --> 01:14:14,678
Yeah, but, baby...
Charlie, why did you leave me?

862
01:14:14,745 --> 01:14:16,719
<i>C'est la vie...</i>

863
01:14:16,792 --> 01:14:19,247
I'm sorry, I forgot!

864
01:14:19,320 --> 01:14:22,735
- I'm just a man!
- You forgot?! You forgot?! You forgot?

865
01:14:22,808 --> 01:14:25,329
- Charlie, you shouldn't have left me.
- So sorry.

866
01:14:25,401 --> 01:14:27,506
You shouldn't have left me.

867
01:14:29,337 --> 01:14:32,336
The bastard. He let her burn.

868
01:14:45,337 --> 01:14:47,574
- Why?
- Shh...

869
01:14:55,833 --> 01:14:57,840
Don't worry, don't worry.

870
01:14:58,873 --> 01:15:00,783
Don't worry.

871
01:15:02,969 --> 01:15:05,358
It is going to be OK.

872
01:15:05,433 --> 01:15:08,215
- Mmm, it's going to be...
- Ow.

873
01:15:08,280 --> 01:15:09,971
- It's going to be all right.
- Ow!

874
01:15:10,041 --> 01:15:11,951
- Shh-shh-shh...
- Please stop.

875
01:15:12,024 --> 01:15:15,472
No, no, no, no.
It's going to be OK now.

876
01:15:15,545 --> 01:15:19,025
- Please don't, please...
- It's going to be all right.

877
01:15:19,096 --> 01:15:21,136
<i>Oh!</i>

878
01:15:21,209 --> 01:15:25,682
- Don't worry. I promise.
- Ow. Please stop it, please...

879
01:15:32,409 --> 01:15:34,318
Please... Ow! Please...

880
01:15:37,753 --> 01:15:41,549
Don't worry, it's going to be OK,
it's going to be all right.

881
01:15:43,481 --> 01:15:46,132
Charlie, Charlie...

882
01:15:46,201 --> 01:15:48,437
Oh! Please, you're hurting me, Charlie.

883
01:15:48,504 --> 01:15:50,676
Don't worry, don't worry.

884
01:15:51,992 --> 01:15:54,643
Please... Hey, hey, hey...

885
01:16:02,361 --> 01:16:04,270
I'm sorry, Michael.

886
01:16:05,272 --> 01:16:06,865
Why?

887
01:16:07,897 --> 01:16:09,807
Because I'm so weak.

888
01:16:10,809 --> 01:16:13,198
No, you're not weak.

889
01:16:13,273 --> 01:16:15,825
- Oh, yes, I am.
- No...

890
01:16:17,113 --> 01:16:19,633
You're the reason why I'm here.

891
01:16:19,705 --> 01:16:22,094
You make this place beautiful.

892
01:16:26,712 --> 01:16:29,014
- Michael?
- Hmm?

893
01:16:29,624 --> 01:16:32,046
Does anything ever really change?

894
01:16:33,145 --> 01:16:35,796
Yeah. Yeah, I think so.

895
01:16:35,865 --> 01:16:38,679
<i>No, I mean really change.</i>

896
01:16:41,144 --> 01:16:43,381
No. I don't know.

897
01:16:44,857 --> 01:16:47,574
I keep thinking about the sheep.

898
01:16:47,641 --> 01:16:51,470
You know, and them dying
and getting shot, you know, and I...

899
01:16:51,545 --> 01:16:54,480
Well, it didn't take too long.

900
01:16:54,552 --> 01:16:56,887
They didn't suffer, I'm sure.

901
01:16:57,945 --> 01:16:59,733
Give me your hand, come on.

902
01:17:03,736 --> 01:17:06,518
It doesn't take long to die, I think.

903
01:17:08,505 --> 01:17:11,058
Not as long as it takes to live.

904
01:17:13,817 --> 01:17:16,981
<i># Hangman, hangman</i>

905
01:17:17,049 --> 01:17:19,569
<i># Slack your line</i>

01:17:20,793 --> 01:17:24,241
<i># Slack it just a while</i>

916
01:18:15,161 --> 01:18:17,266
You think people will come?

917
01:18:18,616 --> 01:18:20,526
Of course they will.

918
01:18:24,440 --> 01:18:26,742
How do you know?

919
01:18:26,808 --> 01:18:28,718
People will come.

920
01:18:30,617 --> 01:18:32,526
They always do.

921
01:18:34,201 --> 01:18:37,910
They will come to see
the greatest show on earth.

922
01:18:41,433 --> 01:18:46,004
I now declare our majestic theater open!

923
01:18:59,960 --> 01:19:02,743
We did it! Oh, my God!

924
01:19:02,809 --> 01:19:06,125
<i>Girl, we did it!</i>

925
01:19:07,097 --> 01:19:11,155
Thy agents, the casting directors,
will be here!

926
01:19:11,224 --> 01:19:15,381
- Charlie!
- It's finally here! Our theater!

927
01:19:15,449 --> 01:19:17,358
<i>Here!</i>

928
01:19:31,257 --> 01:19:33,591
So a man walks into a bar
with his pet monkey.

929
01:19:33,656 --> 01:19:36,558
The monkey necks three beers
and falls asleep in the corner.

930
01:19:36,632 --> 01:19:39,502
Man goes to leave, barman says,
"Don't leave that lyin' there."

931
01:19:39,576 --> 01:19:41,399
He says, "It's not a lion, it's a monkey."

932
01:19:41,465 --> 01:19:45,010
<i>That's right,
Blue Eyes, with a Dixie melody.</i>

933
01:19:45,080 --> 01:19:49,074
And when you croon, don't get smart, see?
Just croon a little tune.

934
01:19:49,145 --> 01:19:54,163
And it better be from the heart of Brooklyn,
or else you get a knuckle sandwich.

935
01:24:14,488 --> 01:24:19,027
Thank you all for coming out tonight
to see our performance,

936
01:24:19,096 --> 01:24:21,300
our grand show spectacular.

937
01:24:21,976 --> 01:24:27,214
We are but humble impersonators,
regular people like you,

938
01:24:27,288 --> 01:24:30,584
and without you, we would be nothing.

939
01:24:30,648 --> 01:24:35,765
Our goal, as always in performing,
is to try and entertain you

940
01:24:35,832 --> 01:24:39,128
and search out the beauty that is life,

941
01:24:39,192 --> 01:24:42,061
the splendor and poetry of it all.

942
01:24:42,968 --> 01:24:45,139
And, like the song says,

943
01:24:45,208 --> 01:24:50,423
"There is heaven,
heaven when we dance together,

944
01:24:50,489 --> 01:24:54,002
you and I cheek to cheek."

945
01:24:54,937 --> 01:24:56,976
Thank you all.

946
01:24:57,048 --> 01:25:03,540
And remember, there's no truer souls
than those souls who impersonate.

947
01:25:03,608 --> 01:25:05,518
For we live through others

948
01:25:05,592 --> 01:25:10,197
in order to keep the spirit of wonder alive.

949
01:25:10,264 --> 01:25:13,580
Thank you, thank you.

950
01:25:13,656 --> 01:25:15,893
God be with you all.

951
01:25:29,752 --> 01:25:32,534
Well, that was only our first night.

952
01:25:36,728 --> 01:25:38,637
More people will come.

953
01:25:47,224 --> 01:25:49,134
It just takes time.

954
01:26:01,848 --> 01:26:04,717
That's show business, folks.

955
01:27:38,520 --> 01:27:40,429
<i>No.</i>

956
01:27:43,064 --> 01:27:44,973
No.

957
01:27:50,712 --> 01:27:52,622
<i>No!</i>

958
01:27:53,592 --> 01:27:55,502
Please...

959
01:27:58,903 --> 01:28:00,813
No!

960
01:28:09,048 --> 01:28:11,983
Please... no.

961
01:28:19,896 --> 01:28:21,805
<i>No...</i>

962
01:28:30,744 --> 01:28:33,297
<i>No...</i>

963
01:28:33,368 --> 01:28:36,663
Please... no.

964
01:28:39,160 --> 01:28:41,070
No...

965
01:28:43,128 --> 01:28:45,037
No...

966
01:28:45,784 --> 01:28:49,494
No... no!

967
01:28:53,688 --> 01:28:55,597
No!

968
01:28:57,880 --> 01:28:59,789
No.

969
01:29:02,968 --> 01:29:04,878
No...

970
01:30:23,480 --> 01:30:28,117
<i>Yeah! Sisters, load the plane.</i>

971
01:30:28,184 --> 01:30:29,777
<i>- Have a safe flight.
- Yes.</i>

972
01:30:29,848 --> 01:30:31,920
Come on, board it, board it, Sister.

973
01:30:31,992 --> 01:30:36,880
You are gonna go to the Vatican.
You're gonna go to the Vatican.

974
01:30:36,951 --> 01:30:39,799
Don't...
Yes, yes, come on, Sisters.

975
01:30:39,864 --> 01:30:42,581
You're going to the Vatican.
We have become legitimate.

976
01:30:42,648 --> 01:30:46,226
This is a legitimate miracle.
We've done miracles here.

977
01:30:46,296 --> 01:30:49,296
We have done miracles, yes, so...

978
01:30:49,368 --> 01:30:52,717
Oh, hey, hey, hey, hey, you kid,
you cannot ride this.

979
01:30:52,792 --> 01:30:56,850
I know you are a hell of a man,
but you're not gonna fly, come on.

980
01:30:59,031 --> 01:31:03,701
Sister Agnes, I want you... I want you to be
the first one to meet the Pope,

981
01:31:03,768 --> 01:31:07,565
<i>but you have to kiss his ring.
Silence! Silencio, jóvenes!</i>

982
01:31:07,640 --> 01:31:11,950
So, yes, yes, just humble, but you kiss...
We'll rehearse more.

983
01:31:12,023 --> 01:31:14,358
Yeah, OK, load the plane, Sister.

984
01:31:14,936 --> 01:31:16,692
<i>Ciao, adios.</i>

985
01:31:16,760 --> 01:31:19,149
OK, OK, goodbye, bye-bye.

986
01:31:19,224 --> 01:31:23,861
<i>Yes. Sisters, watch your toes.</i>

987
01:31:26,071 --> 01:31:28,722
It's just unbelievable.
You did it, you did it, yes.

988
01:31:28,791 --> 01:31:31,028
<i>Hallelujah!</i>

989
01:31:31,096 --> 01:31:34,925
- Yes, hallelujah.
- We'll have a nice time with the Pope.

990
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:39,473
But don't overload the Vatican.
Don't overload the Vatican.

991
01:31:39,544 --> 01:31:43,406
Be humble, because I want to have
a drink with the Pope.

992
01:31:43,480 --> 01:31:45,619
I just want to have a real drink.

993
01:31:45,688 --> 01:31:48,470
You know, he's Bavarian
and he likes the beer.

994
01:31:48,536 --> 01:31:51,405
It's a real miracle,
and you are with me now.

995
01:31:51,479 --> 01:31:54,513
Sisters, Sisters, here we go.

996
01:31:54,584 --> 01:31:57,518
Here we go. All the way to Rome.

997
01:33:03,768 --> 01:33:07,117
<i># I feel so small</i>

998
01:33:08,856 --> 01:33:12,467
<i># And my life</i>

999
01:33:12,535 --> 01:33:15,831
<i># It's only a season</i>

1000
01:33:15,896 --> 01:33:19,987

1001
01:33:20,055 --> 01:33:23,470
<i># That no one will recall</i>

1002
01:33:27,991 --> 01:33:34,189
<i># But I gave joy to my mother</i>

1003
01:33:36,119 --> 01:33:42,742
<i># And I made my lover smile</i>

1004
01:33:44,088 --> 01:33:48,496

1005

<i># When they're hurting</i>

1006
01:33:52,695 --> 01:33:57,202

1007
01:33:57,720 --> 01:34:01,200
<i># For a while</i>

1008
01:34:07,896 --> 01:34:10,995

1009
01:34:11,064 --> 01:34:14,380

1010

<i># My way out of this night</i>

1012

1013
01:34:27,671 --> 01:34:30,705
<i># It's tangled in wishes</i>

1014
01:34:30,776 --> 01:34:39,189
<i># And so many things

01:35:34,136 --> 01:35:37,584

1025
01:35:37,655 --> 01:35:41,136
<i># Oh #</i>

1026
01:35:45,015 --> 01:35:46,324
Hey.

1027
01:35:53,399 --> 01:35:55,439
What happened to you?

1028
01:35:55,512 --> 01:35:58,163
Michael, it's OK.

1029
01:35:58,232 --> 01:36:02,094
I had to leave, but I'm OK.

1030
01:36:03,159 --> 01:36:06,607
But... why did you die?

1031
01:36:07,576 --> 01:36:10,575
Life was just too difficult for me.

1032
01:36:10,647 --> 01:36:12,916
I wasn't cut out for it.

1033
01:36:15,799 --> 01:36:18,188
Am I ever gonna see you again?

1034
01:36:18,839 --> 01:36:21,523
Sure you will, Michael,

1035
01:36:21,591 --> 01:36:24,690
but your path is different than mine.

1036
01:36:24,760 --> 01:36:27,345
You must stay strong, Michael.

1037
01:36:27,415 --> 01:36:29,073
Keep searching.

1038
01:36:29,143 --> 01:36:31,053
Don't give up.

1039
01:36:31,736 --> 01:36:35,281
Yeah, but... you gave up.

1040
01:36:35,351 --> 01:36:37,588
Oh, no, Michael.

1041
01:36:38,712 --> 01:36:41,363
I just followed my own destiny,

1042
01:36:41,432 --> 01:36:43,887
as you must follow yours.

1043
01:36:47,096 --> 01:36:49,005
What is that?

1044
01:36:50,871 --> 01:36:53,173
What am I supposed to do now?

1045
01:37:30,808 --> 01:37:32,237
<i>So, Michael...</i>

1046
01:37:34,071 --> 01:37:36,243
what has happened to you?

1047
01:37:38,455 --> 01:37:40,211
I'm finished.

1048
01:37:40,279 --> 01:37:42,668
Finished? Why finished?

1049
01:37:45,015 --> 01:37:49,871
- I'm going straight, Renard.
- This is impossible, my friend. Impossible.

1050
01:37:49,944 --> 01:37:51,569
- No.
- Yes.

1051
01:37:51,639 --> 01:37:53,232
No, it's not impossible.

1052
01:37:53,303 --> 01:37:56,686
If you believe you can be
whoever you wanna be?

1053
01:37:56,759 --> 01:37:58,669
You can't.

1054
01:37:59,608 --> 01:38:02,804
I've seen hundreds of guys try this.
It never works.

1055
01:38:02,871 --> 01:38:05,555
You'll always be who you are. Always.

1056
01:38:05,623 --> 01:38:07,532
And you...

1057
01:38:07,607 --> 01:38:09,876
You are Michael Jackson.

1058
01:38:11,543 --> 01:38:13,812
- No, no, I'm not.
- Yes, yes, yes, you are.

1059
01:38:13,879 --> 01:38:16,727
- No, I'm not!
- Michael Jackson.

1060
01:38:18,392 --> 01:38:22,734
So tell me, why... why do you
wanna be like everybody else?

1061
01:38:23,735 --> 01:38:27,031
Can't you see
everybody else is miserable?

1062
01:38:28,631 --> 01:38:32,046
I pity you.
I'll never support you in this decision.

1063
01:38:33,943 --> 01:38:35,853
That's fine, Renard.

1064
01:38:38,903 --> 01:38:40,813
You don't have to.

1065
01:38:45,495 --> 01:38:48,811
I don't know who's sitting
in this chair in front of me.

1066
01:38:48,887 --> 01:38:51,757
And you don't know, do you?

1067
01:38:54,520 --> 01:38:56,429
I don't know.

1068
01:38:58,583 --> 01:39:00,492
I have to find out.

1069
01:39:15,479 --> 01:39:18,065
<i>There are plagues everywhere.</i>

1070
01:39:18,135 --> 01:39:21,364
<i>There is sickness and disease
that is everywhere.</i>

1071
01:39:22,168 --> 01:39:25,364
<i>Everyone tries to hide from these things -</i>

1072
01:39:25,431 --> 01:39:27,733
<i>the darkness and the shadows.</i>

1073
01:39:29,367 --> 01:39:33,109
<i>It is just a matter of time
till it finds you.</i>

1074
01:39:33,176 --> 01:39:35,510
<i>I know that.</i>

1075
01:39:35,575 --> 01:39:38,958
<i>I cannot outrun it. I can't hide from it.</i>

1076
01:39:40,087 --> 01:39:41,997
<i>There is nowhere to go.</i>

1077
01:39:43,767 --> 01:39:46,069
<i>It is my wish to embrace it...</i>

1078
01:39:47,031 --> 01:39:49,878
<i>to be alone in the middle of the crowd.</i>

1079
01:39:51,031 --> 01:39:54,260
<i>I know this is all an illusion, a dream.</i>

1080
01:39:56,663 --> 01:39:59,119
<i>It must come to an end.</i>

1081
01:39:59,191 --> 01:40:02,290
<i>Nothing too good lasts too long.</i>

1082
01:40:02,359 --> 01:40:05,294
<i>I can see the hope in everyone's faces.</i>

1083
01:40:05,368 --> 01:40:07,823
<i>I know they're all searching for something.</i>

1084
01:40:07,896 --> 01:40:10,230
<i>They're all chasing a great dream.</i>

1085
01:40:10,295 --> 01:40:13,524
<i>Each of them wants to better themselves.</i>

1086
01:40:13,591 --> 01:40:15,926
<i>They're all looking for answers.</i>

1087
01:40:17,271 --> 01:40:21,744
<i>What they don't realize
is that they have found it already.</i>

1088
01:40:21,815 --> 01:40:24,401
<i>They have found it in one another.</i>

1089
01:40:29,399 --> 01:40:32,017
<i>And, as always,</i>

1090
01:40:32,087 --> 01:40:35,383
<i>the world outside is waiting for us.</i>

1091
01:40:35,447 --> 01:40:37,967
<i>Waiting patiently</i>

1092
01:40:38,039 --> 01:40:39,949
<i>to take us away.</i>

1093
01:44:29,303 --> 01:44:33,711
<i># Standing
on the promises of Christ my King</i>

1094
01:44:33,783 --> 01:44:38,540
<i># Through eternal ages
let his praises ring</i>

1095
01:44:38,615 --> 01:44:43,318
<i># Glory in the highest,
I will shout and sing</i>
