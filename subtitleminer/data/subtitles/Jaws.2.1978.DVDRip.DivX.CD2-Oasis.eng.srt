00:00:35,621 --> 00:00:39,750
- Hey, Tom!
- Nicholas! You should be in class.

2
00:00:39,792 --> 00:00:41,669
I've got company!

3
00:00:42,711 --> 00:00:46,006
- I'm going for lobster.
- Great! Bring me one!

4
00:00:46,048 --> 00:00:49,468
- I want mine with butter.
- Got that, Tom?

5
00:00:50,511 --> 00:00:52,721
So long, turkeys.

6
00:00:52,763 --> 00:00:55,224
Sparky will take you down today.

7
00:00:55,266 --> 00:00:57,935
If you're ready,
let's buddy-up and drop.

8
00:03:50,971 --> 00:03:54,141
Get us in!
For Christ's sake, get us in.

9
00:03:54,182 --> 00:03:57,019
Let's get him in and keep him warm.

10
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:58,979
Put him in the forward cabin.

11
00:04:00,897 --> 00:04:04,401
He'll be OK. Things'll be OK.

12
00:04:04,443 --> 00:04:06,570
Let's go.

13
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:44,251
Thank you.

14
00:05:54,136 --> 00:05:55,887
So?

15
00:05:58,473 --> 00:06:01,852
So, I'll go down to the office,
clean out the desk,

16
00:06:01,893 --> 00:06:04,271
turn in the truck,

17
00:06:04,313 --> 00:06:07,899
and maybe get shitfaced
and rap your boss in the mouth.

18
00:06:07,941 --> 00:06:09,651
I better give notice.

19
00:06:09,693 --> 00:06:12,279
Take it easy. We may need the income.

20
00:06:14,906 --> 00:06:16,575
Mike's gone.

21
00:06:17,951 --> 00:06:21,663
He's making out early these days,
must be a morning man.

22
00:06:21,705 --> 00:06:23,332
Like his father.

23
00:06:28,253 --> 00:06:31,048
Good morning. Anything special today?

24
00:06:31,089 --> 00:06:35,344
No. Sean's out somewhere.
Let him have whatever he wants.

25
00:06:35,385 --> 00:06:38,430
- Just keep him away from the candy.
- OK.

26
00:06:38,472 --> 00:06:41,099
- Do I still get my ride?
- Mmm.

27
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:46,355
Call your brother, the plumber,
that sink upstairs is screwed up.

28
00:06:46,396 --> 00:06:48,774
Frankie? He's my cousin.

29
00:06:48,815 --> 00:06:51,860
Ask if he can use an apprentice.

30
00:06:51,902 --> 00:06:53,737
Have a nice day.

31
00:07:22,849 --> 00:07:25,477
Do you want to just leave
her pointing up?

32
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:27,270
I'm on it.

33
00:07:27,312 --> 00:07:31,358
There we go. Yeah, this is fine.

34
00:07:32,776 --> 00:07:34,444
What about sailing?

35
00:07:34,486 --> 00:07:36,196
What about it?

36
00:07:36,238 --> 00:07:38,657
Don't you worry. We're gonna make it.

37
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:41,451
We'll make it to Budapest
if you're not careful!

38
00:07:41,493 --> 00:07:43,328
Hey, what about the others?

39
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:45,664
What about them?

40
00:07:45,706 --> 00:07:48,000
They'll be there when we get there.

41
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:50,961
They'll have their bonfire,
clams, liquor...

42
00:07:51,003 --> 00:07:52,296
Yeah?

43
00:07:52,337 --> 00:07:55,132
What are we gonna do in the meantime?

44
00:07:55,173 --> 00:07:59,303
Well, in the meantime,
we'll have to think of something.

45
00:08:06,643 --> 00:08:08,186
Wait a minute.

46
00:08:08,228 --> 00:08:09,646
What?

47
00:08:10,647 --> 00:08:12,399
Get out the blanket.

48
00:08:12,441 --> 00:08:16,695
I got black marks all over my butt
and mom's getting uptight about it.

49
00:08:16,737 --> 00:08:18,155
OK.

50
00:08:19,615 --> 00:08:21,366
Out with the blanket.

51
00:08:23,702 --> 00:08:25,454
You really need a blanket?

52
00:08:25,495 --> 00:08:27,372
I don't need one!

53
00:08:35,505 --> 00:08:38,717
Well... here's your blanket.

54
00:08:46,141 --> 00:08:48,352
Eddie! Help!

55
00:08:50,979 --> 00:08:52,189
Eddie!

56
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:54,775
- Tina!
- Help me!

57
00:08:54,816 --> 00:08:56,485
Tina!

58
00:09:25,055 --> 00:09:27,182
Oh... Jesus.

59
00:09:27,224 --> 00:09:31,228
Eddie, swim!
Swim fast, it's a shark, Eddie.

60
00:09:31,269 --> 00:09:32,479
Swim!

61
00:09:36,566 --> 00:09:39,111
Oh, God. Eddie, swim!

62
00:09:39,152 --> 00:09:41,697
Swim faster! Hurry!

63
00:09:41,738 --> 00:09:44,658
Come on! Swim!

64
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:48,328
Hurry, Eddie. It's a shark!

65
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:52,249
Eddie, hurry! Faster! Come on. Swim!

66
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:54,626
Hurry! Hurry, Eddie.

67
00:10:00,007 --> 00:10:01,174
Eddie!

68
00:10:20,485 --> 00:10:22,279
Tina...

69
00:10:33,749 --> 00:10:35,500
Oh, Mama...

70
00:10:38,837 --> 00:10:41,214
Please make it go away.

71
00:10:44,301 --> 00:10:46,011
Make it go away.

72
00:10:47,387 --> 00:10:49,431
Make it go away.

73
00:11:01,109 --> 00:11:03,236
Honey, it's not your job any more.

74
00:11:03,278 --> 00:11:05,155
I just wanna look.

75
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:18,543
Come on, get out of there! Come on.

76
00:11:50,325 --> 00:11:54,538
- What happened to him?
- Embolism. Air bubbles in the blood.

77
00:11:54,579 --> 00:11:57,165
He came up too fast, Chief.

78
00:11:57,207 --> 00:11:59,126
Something must have scared him.

79
00:11:59,167 --> 00:12:00,961
He just panicked.

80
00:12:01,003 --> 00:12:03,880
Don't worry,
we're taking good care of him.

81
00:12:11,138 --> 00:12:12,889
How did this happen?

82
00:12:12,931 --> 00:12:15,559
Bite reflex, like a spasm.

83
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,145
It happened after the kids went out.

84
00:12:18,186 --> 00:12:20,063
What kids?

85
00:12:20,105 --> 00:12:24,192
Junior Vaughan,
Brookie Peters, Jackie, Mike...

86
00:12:24,234 --> 00:12:25,902
Our Mike?

87
00:12:25,944 --> 00:12:28,488
They're headed
for the lighthouse. Hey!

88
00:12:40,584 --> 00:12:44,755
Look, Chief, you're not chief now.
I can't let you take her out.

89
00:12:44,796 --> 00:12:48,425
Mrs Brody, look, you can't go.
Neither one of you can go.

90
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:50,761
- Get that line.
- Mike is out there.

91
00:12:50,802 --> 00:12:54,097
But I signed for the boat.
Mrs Brody, please.

92
00:12:54,139 --> 00:12:58,352
Shit! Chief, go on up to the bow,
you're doing that wrong.

93
00:12:58,393 --> 00:13:00,520
Go ahead, untie the bowline.

94
00:13:00,562 --> 00:13:02,939
They can't fire both of us, right?

95
00:13:02,981 --> 00:13:05,025
Somebody's got to be in charge.

96
00:13:05,067 --> 00:13:08,487
All right,
which direction do you wanna go?

97
00:13:08,528 --> 00:13:11,239
You said something
about a lighthouse.

98
00:13:11,281 --> 00:13:12,491
All right.

99
00:13:30,634 --> 00:13:33,345
Amity Launch to Harbour Patrol.

100
00:13:33,387 --> 00:13:35,097
'This is Harbour Patrol. '

101
00:13:35,138 --> 00:13:38,475
Listen, do you think
you can raise me a chopper?

102
00:13:38,517 --> 00:13:41,645
'Is that you Brody? Not right away.

103
00:13:41,687 --> 00:13:43,689
'It's out checking a buoy. '

104
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:45,732
Get it out to the lighthouse.

105
00:13:45,774 --> 00:13:49,611
There's some kids sailing out there.
I want them back in port.

106
00:13:49,653 --> 00:13:53,156
'Affirmative.
Turn the kids back to port.

107
00:13:53,198 --> 00:13:55,367
'I heard you. Patrol out. '

108
00:13:55,409 --> 00:13:57,369
Brody out.

109
00:14:04,001 --> 00:14:06,586
Hurry up, suckers, you're dragging!

110
00:14:16,305 --> 00:14:21,310
Hey, let's go past the lighthouse.
I know a better spot. Come about.

111
00:14:21,351 --> 00:14:23,103
You got it!

112
00:15:58,824 --> 00:16:00,492
I got it, Chief.

113
00:16:26,476 --> 00:16:28,979
It's all right. Come on.

114
00:16:30,272 --> 00:16:31,815
It's OK.

115
00:16:33,358 --> 00:16:35,235
It's all right.

116
00:16:35,277 --> 00:16:36,486
No.

117
00:16:37,487 --> 00:16:39,281
No.

118
00:16:40,532 --> 00:16:41,783
Ellen.

119
00:16:43,619 --> 00:16:45,912
No, no.

120
00:16:49,625 --> 00:16:51,668
Tina, Tina...

121
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:54,421
Tina, it's OK.

122
00:16:54,463 --> 00:16:56,548
- It's still there.
- What is?

123
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:58,258
What's still there?

124
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:01,053
Sh-sh-sh-sh...

125
00:17:01,094 --> 00:17:02,888
Shark!

126
00:17:04,348 --> 00:17:06,224
It's still there.

127
00:17:30,999 --> 00:17:34,419
That boat will take you in.
Where the hell are they?

128
00:17:34,461 --> 00:17:37,631
Ten degrees off your starboard.
Take a heading...

129
00:17:37,673 --> 00:17:39,216
Not that shit! Point!

130
00:17:39,257 --> 00:17:40,425
There.

131
00:17:40,467 --> 00:17:42,886
All right, I got it.

132
00:18:00,821 --> 00:18:04,199
Mr Christian! Mr Christian!

133
00:18:04,241 --> 00:18:08,412
Pump up this boat! And shave off
that dreadful moustache.

134
00:18:08,453 --> 00:18:13,083
England expects every man
to do his duty. Fire when ready!

135
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:16,295
Damn the torpedoes!
Full speed ahead!

136
00:18:16,336 --> 00:18:19,631
This will be our finest hour.

137
00:18:22,009 --> 00:18:23,677
Oh, shit.

138
00:18:23,802 --> 00:18:26,596
Hey, Bligh, someone pop your balloon?

139
00:18:26,638 --> 00:18:29,182
No problem, no problem.

140
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:02,215
Balance the boat!

141
00:19:17,022 --> 00:19:19,149
Watch out!

142
00:19:22,027 --> 00:19:23,779
Do something!

143
00:19:29,868 --> 00:19:31,370
Timmy! Brooke!

144
00:19:31,453 --> 00:19:33,080
Hey! Look out.

145
00:19:37,876 --> 00:19:39,711
Where is it?

146
00:19:39,753 --> 00:19:43,006
- Get me out of here!
- I'll get you out.

147
00:19:43,048 --> 00:19:44,257
Larry!

148
00:19:44,299 --> 00:19:46,677
Larry! Turn!

149
00:19:47,135 --> 00:19:49,054
Turn!

150
00:19:54,518 --> 00:19:56,353
It's OK.

151
00:19:59,523 --> 00:20:02,943
- Hurry up!
- Mike's out there.

152
00:20:02,985 --> 00:20:04,736
Out of the water.

153
00:20:09,116 --> 00:20:12,160
Somebody look out for Mike!

154
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:14,871
Hang on to something!

155
00:20:14,913 --> 00:20:17,416
Mike, get out of there!

156
00:20:18,542 --> 00:20:20,460
Hold on!

157
00:20:24,548 --> 00:20:26,133
Oh, my God.

158
00:20:26,174 --> 00:20:28,010
Mike!

159
00:20:29,094 --> 00:20:31,179
Brody!

160
00:20:31,221 --> 00:20:32,556
That's it.

161
00:20:34,266 --> 00:20:37,144
- Get his arm.
- Come on.

162
00:20:39,229 --> 00:20:40,981
Pull his jacket!

163
00:20:44,443 --> 00:20:46,987
Get him clear, it's coming up.

164
00:20:51,366 --> 00:20:53,076
Come on! Come on!

165
00:21:01,293 --> 00:21:03,253
Shit!

166
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:34,826
He's bleeding pretty bad.

167
00:21:37,579 --> 00:21:40,123
We got to get Mike to a doctor.

168
00:21:40,165 --> 00:21:41,875
Can you sail?

169
00:21:41,917 --> 00:21:44,127
Yeah. We'll take him in.

170
00:21:44,169 --> 00:21:45,879
OK. Get some help here fast.

171
00:21:45,921 --> 00:21:47,756
Let's go.

172
00:22:04,564 --> 00:22:06,775
Let's wrap this mess up.

173
00:22:08,068 --> 00:22:10,237
Throw this to Brooke.

174
00:22:11,238 --> 00:22:13,782
Brooke, get this
and throw it to Mark.

175
00:22:17,536 --> 00:22:19,246
Here, take it.

176
00:22:19,288 --> 00:22:22,332
Tie a bowline around your mast.

177
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,503
Easy.

178
00:22:26,545 --> 00:22:28,297
Come on, pull.

179
00:22:28,338 --> 00:22:30,299
I don't know if it'll hold.

180
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:32,551
All right. Someone put a fender up.

181
00:22:32,592 --> 00:22:34,928
We could use another hand on this.

182
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:36,722
Take it easy. Just pull.

183
00:22:37,973 --> 00:22:39,725
Tie it off. All right.

184
00:23:13,342 --> 00:23:15,552
Amity Launch to Air Patrol One.

185
00:23:16,345 --> 00:23:18,639
Amity Launch to Air Patrol One.

186
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,349
Do you read me?

187
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:23,018
'This is Air Patrol.
That you, Brody?'

188
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:26,104
Yeah. Do you have
a fix on those kids?

189
00:23:26,146 --> 00:23:27,981
'Negative. I'm still down. '

190
00:23:28,023 --> 00:23:31,485
Get the hell up
because I'm out here alone.

191
00:23:31,526 --> 00:23:33,779
'Brody, I got to switch frequencies.

192
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:37,366
'Call my boss.
I'll meet you by Francis Shoal. Out. '

193
00:23:39,493 --> 00:23:42,579
Francis Shoal?
Where the hell is Francis Shoal?

194
00:23:56,259 --> 00:23:58,303
Shit.

195
00:23:58,345 --> 00:24:00,597
I'm all alone out here.

196
00:24:42,097 --> 00:24:44,057
Anyone want to play charades?

197
00:24:46,351 --> 00:24:47,394
No.

198
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:51,732
All we have to do is land
at Cable Junction and wait.

199
00:24:51,773 --> 00:24:54,276
How will we do that on this garbage?

200
00:24:57,321 --> 00:24:59,573
What's after Cable Junction?

201
00:24:59,615 --> 00:25:02,743
The Atlantic. Then Ireland.

202
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:08,957
God, I'm hungry.

203
00:25:39,154 --> 00:25:41,114
Air Patrol to Base.

204
00:25:41,156 --> 00:25:44,993
I have a positive location
on that sailing party.

205
00:25:45,035 --> 00:25:47,287
Disabled and adrift,

206
00:25:47,329 --> 00:25:50,958
about three quarters of a mile west
of Cable Junction,

207
00:25:50,999 --> 00:25:53,710
wind and tide carrying them due east.

208
00:26:42,009 --> 00:26:44,177
Is everyone OK? Is anybody hurt?

209
00:26:44,219 --> 00:26:45,345
No!

210
00:26:45,387 --> 00:26:47,764
I'll tow you to Cable Junction,

211
00:26:47,806 --> 00:26:50,517
then call the Coast Guard.

212
00:26:52,477 --> 00:26:54,479
Throw me a line.

213
00:26:54,521 --> 00:26:56,982
Take it easy. Here we go.

214
00:26:57,024 --> 00:26:59,610
- Oh, what a day
- Here you go!

215
00:27:09,453 --> 00:27:10,871
OK.

216
00:27:12,998 --> 00:27:15,626
- Now, hold on to something.
- OK.

217
00:27:15,667 --> 00:27:18,045
- Hurry up!
- Better hang on.

218
00:29:18,749 --> 00:29:20,334
Sean.

219
00:29:20,375 --> 00:29:23,211
- Sean!
- Sean!

220
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,673
Sean!

221
00:29:27,674 --> 00:29:29,176
Sean!

222
00:29:30,385 --> 00:29:31,762
Get him in the boat.

223
00:29:33,347 --> 00:29:34,931
- Sean!
- Come on!

224
00:29:34,973 --> 00:29:36,350
Get aboard.

225
00:29:36,391 --> 00:29:38,393
- Hurry!
- Come on.

226
00:29:41,563 --> 00:29:43,273
Come on.

227
00:29:48,403 --> 00:29:50,364
I can't get up.

228
00:29:54,743 --> 00:29:56,370
No!

229
00:30:00,290 --> 00:30:01,333
No!

230
00:30:05,545 --> 00:30:08,757
Take her to the hospital
and meet me at the office.

231
00:30:12,803 --> 00:30:15,263
Try to understand my position...

232
00:30:15,305 --> 00:30:17,641
Tina will be all right. Are you OK?

233
00:30:19,184 --> 00:30:22,020
Ellen, I'm sorry.
Believe me, I'm sorry.

234
00:30:22,062 --> 00:30:23,814
I was only thinking of...

235
00:30:23,855 --> 00:30:26,108
I don't give a damn what you think.

236
00:30:26,149 --> 00:30:30,112
A boy is dead and my son and husband
are still out there.

237
00:31:17,326 --> 00:31:20,162
Amity Launch to Harbour Patrol.

238
00:31:26,918 --> 00:31:28,837
Amity Launch to Harbour...

239
00:31:30,464 --> 00:31:31,923
Damn it!

240
00:31:39,097 --> 00:31:41,600
Sean, catch the rope!

241
00:31:41,642 --> 00:31:44,770
- Come on, the rope!
- Sean!

242
00:31:44,811 --> 00:31:46,480
Sean, catch the rope!

243
00:31:46,521 --> 00:31:48,315
Sean, the rope!

244
00:31:48,357 --> 00:31:52,194
- Come on, Sean!
- Come on, Sean!

245
00:31:52,235 --> 00:31:53,779
Come on!

246
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:54,947
Sean!

247
00:31:54,988 --> 00:31:56,990
Sean, catch the rope!

248
00:31:57,032 --> 00:31:58,659
The rope, Sean!

249
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:00,410
Come on, Sean!

250
00:32:00,452 --> 00:32:03,205
Come on!
You've gotta help or it won't work.

251
00:32:03,246 --> 00:32:04,957
Will you stop?

252
00:32:04,998 --> 00:32:07,542
Come on, Sean, wake up!

253
00:32:08,126 --> 00:32:09,795
Pick it up!

254
00:32:11,546 --> 00:32:12,923
Sean!

255
00:32:13,924 --> 00:32:15,717
Sean, goddamn it.

256
00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:18,929
Sean, listen to me
or I'll break your ass!

257
00:32:23,308 --> 00:32:24,601
OK, come on.

258
00:32:26,103 --> 00:32:28,313
OK, Sean, now listen.

259
00:32:28,355 --> 00:32:31,692
We'll throw you this rope
and you better catch it.

260
00:32:31,733 --> 00:32:33,443
Sean, you ready?

261
00:32:33,485 --> 00:32:35,529
Here it comes, kid.

262
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:41,743
Get it, Sean.

263
00:32:41,785 --> 00:32:44,037
Sean, get it.

264
00:32:44,079 --> 00:32:46,373
Come on, get it.

265
00:32:46,415 --> 00:32:50,002
Good. Now tie it around
the centreboard.

266
00:32:50,043 --> 00:32:51,920
Tie it tight.

267
00:32:54,506 --> 00:32:56,091
You ready? Hang on.

268
00:32:56,133 --> 00:32:57,467
Hold on.

269
00:32:57,509 --> 00:32:59,261
Hang on, OK?

270
00:32:59,303 --> 00:33:01,430
Here we go. Hold on tight.

271
00:33:12,024 --> 00:33:13,567
OK, kid.

272
00:33:15,193 --> 00:33:17,237
Take it easy.

273
00:33:19,448 --> 00:33:21,074
Come on.

274
00:33:21,116 --> 00:33:22,576
OK.

275
00:33:26,330 --> 00:33:28,915
- Get him out!
- Come on.

276
00:33:39,134 --> 00:33:41,386
Oh, God. Are you OK, kid?

277
00:33:41,428 --> 00:33:43,639
I thought we lost you.

278
00:33:50,979 --> 00:33:52,898
Cable Junction's ahead.

279
00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:56,068
- Can we make it?
- I don't know.

280
00:33:56,109 --> 00:33:58,528
- Hey, I was just asking!
- I know.

281
00:34:01,615 --> 00:34:03,283
How's she doing?

282
00:34:03,325 --> 00:34:05,327
Just got to keep her warm.

283
00:34:08,622 --> 00:34:11,166
Somebody help me
and we could steer this.

284
00:34:12,584 --> 00:34:15,003
What are you playing
with a tube for?

285
00:34:15,045 --> 00:34:17,047
- If everyone...
- Shut up!

286
00:34:17,089 --> 00:34:20,175
I'm sorry
but I can't stop thinking about this!

287
00:34:20,217 --> 00:34:21,802
Well, you better try!

288
00:34:21,843 --> 00:34:24,721
Oh, God, please help.

289
00:34:25,889 --> 00:34:27,683
Jesus...

290
00:34:27,724 --> 00:34:29,559
Holy Mary,

291
00:34:29,601 --> 00:34:31,561
Mother of Christ,

292
00:34:31,603 --> 00:34:33,355
please help us.

293
00:34:35,357 --> 00:34:37,359
Please help us.

294
00:34:38,568 --> 00:34:40,320
We're begging.

295
00:34:44,116 --> 00:34:46,326
Please save us.

296
00:35:48,889 --> 00:35:50,932
Oh, thank Christ.

297
00:35:59,358 --> 00:36:01,652
Here, take that back to the cleat.

298
00:36:06,031 --> 00:36:08,367
- What happened?
- I'm OK.

299
00:36:08,408 --> 00:36:11,036
- Sure?
- A shark hit us.

300
00:36:11,078 --> 00:36:13,038
Sean's out there.

301
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:16,625
- What?
- He wanted to come.

302
00:36:16,667 --> 00:36:18,001
Where are they?

303
00:36:18,043 --> 00:36:21,797
They're in the current
heading for Cable Junction.

304
00:36:21,838 --> 00:36:25,467
All right, get to the lighthouse
and stay there, OK?

305
00:36:25,509 --> 00:36:28,220
- Stay there.
- I'm sorry, Dad.

306
00:36:28,261 --> 00:36:31,014
Forget it.
Just get to the lighthouse.

307
00:36:40,691 --> 00:36:43,318
- We're almost there.
- It's not gonna work.

308
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:45,487
Come on, more to port.

309
00:36:45,529 --> 00:36:47,698
Keep it going. We'll make it.

310
00:36:48,573 --> 00:36:50,575
More to port, goddamn it!

311
00:36:50,617 --> 00:36:52,536
All the way over.

312
00:36:53,537 --> 00:36:57,291
Larry, are we going to make it
to the island?

313
00:36:57,332 --> 00:36:59,668
We're steering for it, kid.

314
00:37:00,627 --> 00:37:02,629
But the wind drift is lateral.

315
00:37:02,671 --> 00:37:04,172
What does that mean?

316
00:37:04,214 --> 00:37:07,676
It means that we're going sideways.
We're going that way.

317
00:37:07,718 --> 00:37:10,345
- We were heading right for it.
- Not now.

318
00:37:10,387 --> 00:37:13,473
Shit. Shit, shit, shit.

319
00:37:24,818 --> 00:37:26,903
Wait! Stop paddling.

320
00:37:26,945 --> 00:37:29,990
- What about the island?
- The shark!

321
00:37:55,349 --> 00:37:58,352
- What's happening?
- I think we're stuck.

322
00:37:58,393 --> 00:38:00,479
It's just the bottom.

323
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:03,231
- It's that thing.
- It's just the bottom.

324
00:38:03,273 --> 00:38:08,278
No, it's not the bottom.
It's that thing! It's gonna kill us!

325
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,780
Jackie, shut up!

326
00:38:09,821 --> 00:38:13,867
- No! It's going to kill us!
- Shut up! Shut up!

327
00:38:13,909 --> 00:38:15,619
Leave her alone!

328
00:38:15,661 --> 00:38:17,663
Then you take care of her.

329
00:38:17,704 --> 00:38:20,707
- She's hysterical, beating...
- Sit down.

330
00:38:20,749 --> 00:38:22,334
Be quiet!

331
00:38:23,627 --> 00:38:25,170
Shut up!

332
00:38:25,212 --> 00:38:26,713
Listen!

333
00:38:26,755 --> 00:38:29,299
- She shouldn't freak out.
- Listen!

334
00:38:31,468 --> 00:38:33,345
You hear it?

335
00:38:46,441 --> 00:38:49,278
Over there! It's coming towards us.

336
00:38:52,739 --> 00:38:54,157
It's Dad! Dad!

337
00:39:01,873 --> 00:39:03,333
Dad!

338
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:25,731
Oh, cool. Cool, come on...

339
00:39:43,707 --> 00:39:45,876
Pull yourselves over
and we'll get out of here.

340
00:39:45,917 --> 00:39:49,671
We can't.
We're stuck on the bottom here.

341
00:39:49,713 --> 00:39:51,548
I'll get you closer.
We'll come aboard.

342
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:54,635
- Pull us alongside.
- Please hurry!

343
00:39:54,676 --> 00:39:56,637
All right, hold it steady.

344
00:39:58,221 --> 00:39:59,640
Oh, sh...!

345
00:40:11,151 --> 00:40:12,194
Wait!

346
00:40:18,533 --> 00:40:19,910
Dad!

347
00:40:31,588 --> 00:40:33,715
I'm all right. Hold on.

348
00:40:42,766 --> 00:40:45,727
All right,
take this and I'll get you over.

349
00:40:52,276 --> 00:40:54,319
- All right, tie it on.
- OK.

350
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:08,458
All right,
pull these hooks over with the rope.

351
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:12,796
Secure them to the raft then I'll
pull you back with the winch, OK?

352
00:41:12,838 --> 00:41:14,339
OK.

353
00:41:40,824 --> 00:41:42,701
All right, pull it over.

354
00:41:56,006 --> 00:41:57,466
It's stuck.

355
00:41:57,507 --> 00:42:01,261
Wait a minute, I'll put...
I'll put it in reverse.

356
00:42:45,472 --> 00:42:46,848
Lucy!

357
00:42:46,890 --> 00:42:50,018
Lucy, look out!

358
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:53,105
Oh, my God! No! No!

359
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,068
Lucy!

360
00:43:06,952 --> 00:43:08,870
No!

361
00:43:09,705 --> 00:43:12,291
Oh, my God! No!

362
00:43:12,332 --> 00:43:13,542
Dad!

363
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:17,045
Hold on!

364
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:48,368
Dad!

365
00:43:55,917 --> 00:43:57,294
Get away!

366
00:43:57,336 --> 00:43:58,879
No!

367
00:44:02,507 --> 00:44:04,217
Get away!

368
00:44:18,315 --> 00:44:19,733
No!

369
00:44:26,531 --> 00:44:27,574
Sean!

370
00:45:28,635 --> 00:45:31,680
- Where'd he go?
- Where is he?

371
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:55,662
- There he is!
- Over there.

372
00:46:08,759 --> 00:46:10,927
What the hell are you doing?

373
00:46:15,515 --> 00:46:17,309
Get out of there!

374
00:46:19,436 --> 00:46:21,688
He's heading right for you!

375
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:29,029
All right, you big bastard, come on.

376
00:46:29,738 --> 00:46:31,657
I got something for you now.

377
00:46:34,242 --> 00:46:38,163
That's it! That a boy! Come on!

378
00:46:38,205 --> 00:46:39,623
Right over here!

379
00:46:39,665 --> 00:46:41,291
Dad!

380
00:46:41,333 --> 00:46:43,460
That's it. Come on.

381
00:46:43,502 --> 00:46:47,297
No! Get out of the way!

382
00:46:48,465 --> 00:46:49,675
Don't do it!

383
00:46:51,093 --> 00:46:53,512
Get away! Get away!

384
00:46:53,553 --> 00:46:55,472
Dad! Watch out!

385
00:46:55,514 --> 00:46:56,556
Come on!

386
00:46:56,598 --> 00:46:58,517
Look out!

387
00:46:58,558 --> 00:47:00,018
Open wide!

388
00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:02,604
Open wide, say "ah"!

389
00:47:33,885 --> 00:47:35,971
He did it. He got it!

390
00:48:01,663 --> 00:48:05,208
He did it! He did it! He did it!

391
00:48:05,250 --> 00:48:07,878
Did he get it? It's dead?

392
00:48:07,919 --> 00:48:10,005
It's dead!

393
00:48:19,598 --> 00:48:21,516
Oh, thank you.

394
00:48:21,558 --> 00:48:24,394
Thank you,
thank you, thank you...

395
00:48:38,992 --> 00:48:42,079
- And you...
- They made me go with them.

396
00:48:47,250 --> 00:48:48,502
Sure they did!

397
