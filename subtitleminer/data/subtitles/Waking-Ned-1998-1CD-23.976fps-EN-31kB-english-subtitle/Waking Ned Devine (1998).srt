1
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:29,648
Saturday evening,...

2
00:00:29,737 --> 00:00:34,399
.. and the universe is much the same as at
any other point in the history of the world.

3
00:00:34,491 --> 00:00:39,651
The planets and stars orbit and spin,
and do everything that is expected of them.

4
00:00:39,746 --> 00:00:41,739
On earth, as the sun sets,...

5
00:00:41,832 --> 00:00:45,781
.. millions prepare for a weekly event
which is far less predictable.

6
00:00:45,877 --> 00:00:48,368
In 63 countries around the world,...

7
00:00:48,463 --> 00:00:52,507
.. dozens of lottery machines
spin hundreds of lottery balls.

8
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:56,550
It takes seconds
for the winning numbers to be selected,...

9
00:00:56,637 --> 00:00:59,591
.. seconds for the losers
to realise they have lost.

10
00:00:59,681 --> 00:01:05,351
But, for the winners, it is an event which
will undoubtedly change their lives for ever.

11
00:01:06,563 --> 00:01:08,639
Lucky sods!

12
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:38,126
Welcome to the National Lottery's
weekend draw for Saturday 21st August.

13
00:01:38,217 --> 00:01:41,632
We're coming to you live tonight
from the very heart of Dublin.

14
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:45,967
As we speak - calculating the total amount
of the jackpot to be claimed tonight.

15
00:01:46,057 --> 00:01:49,640
We shall be updating you
on the total jackpot and all the news...

16
00:01:49,727 --> 00:01:53,807
.. in our round-up programme
which follows directly after the news.

17
00:01:53,898 --> 00:01:58,524
For now, let's concentrate on the game
in hand, and get this week's draw under way.

18
00:01:58,611 --> 00:02:01,730
- Match six numbers...
- Annie, where's my ticket?

19
00:02:01,822 --> 00:02:03,898
In your trousers.

20
00:02:03,991 --> 00:02:06,066
Oh, Lord!

21
00:02:07,118 --> 00:02:11,994
Here's Alan Fergis, our independent
observer. Alan is from Stokescroft...

22
00:02:12,081 --> 00:02:16,660
.. Financial Services, and we're honoured
to have him here with us tonight.

23
00:02:16,752 --> 00:02:19,670
There's all your numbers -
1 to 42, poised and ready.

24
00:02:19,755 --> 00:02:22,293
Annie, bring me me apple tart, will you?

25
00:02:22,966 --> 00:02:25,125
Get it yourself.

26
00:02:25,219 --> 00:02:28,303
.. release all 42 numbers.
We'll start the selection.

27
00:02:28,388 --> 00:02:30,464
The lotto's starting.

28
00:02:31,224 --> 00:02:34,391
.. as we wait for the first number
to come from the draw drum.

29
00:02:34,477 --> 00:02:37,561
And that first number is... nineteen.

30
00:02:37,647 --> 00:02:40,482
- Oh, yes! There she goes.
- Nineteen.

31
00:02:40,566 --> 00:02:42,060
Number nineteen.

32
00:02:42,151 --> 00:02:45,650
Annie, come in. Bring me me tart.
We got the first one.

33
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:48,522
It's... number forty.

34
00:02:48,615 --> 00:02:52,066
Japers, Annie!
Can you believe it? I got the second!

35
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,912
Our third number... is number four.

36
00:02:54,996 --> 00:02:57,072
Oh, will you look at that, girl!

37
00:02:58,332 --> 00:03:00,704
Here's our fourth number... seven.

38
00:03:00,793 --> 00:03:04,493
Can you believe it, Annie?
Number seven! Come in out of that!

39
00:03:04,588 --> 00:03:06,664
We got the first four!

40
00:03:11,052 --> 00:03:13,128
You're having me on.

41
00:03:13,221 --> 00:03:14,881
Shush, shush, shush.

42
00:03:14,973 --> 00:03:17,049
.. is... twenty-five.

43
00:03:18,518 --> 00:03:21,768
- Twenty-five.
- Annie... we've got it.

44
00:03:21,854 --> 00:03:23,728
Jesus, Jackie,...

45
00:03:23,814 --> 00:03:25,474
.. that's five.

46
00:03:25,566 --> 00:03:27,605
Oh, God help us.

47
00:03:27,693 --> 00:03:29,436
God help us.

48
00:03:35,241 --> 00:03:37,281
And here's the sixth number,...

49
00:03:37,368 --> 00:03:40,488
- .. twenty-nine. Twenty-nine.
- Yes! Yes! Yes!

50
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:41,908
Yes!

51
00:03:41,998 --> 00:03:43,540
Yes! Yes!

52
00:03:43,624 --> 00:03:47,994
Yes! Yes! Yes!

53
00:03:52,466 --> 00:03:54,542
Have we won?

54
00:03:54,634 --> 00:03:58,299
No. But it got me apple tart
brought in now, didn't it?

55
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:20,566
# I wish I was a fisherman

56
00:04:22,118 --> 00:04:24,194
# Tumbling on the seas

57
00:04:26,038 --> 00:04:28,114
# Faraway from dry land

58
00:04:29,041 --> 00:04:31,117
# And its bitter memories

59
00:04:33,128 --> 00:04:35,204
# Casting out my sweet life

60
00:04:35,797 --> 00:04:37,873
# With abandonment and love

61
00:04:39,968 --> 00:04:42,506
# No ceiling bearing down on me

62
00:04:42,595 --> 00:04:45,051
# Save the starry sky above

63
00:04:45,139 --> 00:04:47,215
# With light in my head

64
00:04:48,809 --> 00:04:50,469
# With you in my arms

65
00:04:53,355 --> 00:04:55,431
# Oh!

66
00:05:16,543 --> 00:05:20,375
Michael... Michael O'Sullivan,
are you a millionaire?

67
00:05:20,463 --> 00:05:25,291
Now, Jackie, would I spend me time sitting
on this old beach if I was a millionaire?

68
00:05:25,385 --> 00:05:27,461
I believe you would.

69
00:05:28,054 --> 00:05:31,387
Hold on there now... I've some mighty news.

70
00:05:31,474 --> 00:05:35,851
- Are you going in for a dip?
- More important things to do.

71
00:05:35,936 --> 00:05:40,313
Look and see what I've found in the
small print of The Irish Times last night.

72
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:43,814
Look at it - the front page,
down at the bottom.

73
00:05:43,902 --> 00:05:48,279
Winking at you! Lotto results.
Winner from County More West.

74
00:05:48,364 --> 00:05:51,733
A local winner. Now that's a thing!

75
00:05:51,826 --> 00:05:56,404
It's more than local. County More West is big,
but there's only one village in it.

76
00:05:56,497 --> 00:05:57,528
Tullymore.

77
00:05:57,623 --> 00:05:58,654
Tullymore!

78
00:05:58,749 --> 00:06:00,825
Is it a fact, Jackie?

79
00:06:00,917 --> 00:06:04,286
- A winner in the village?
- In Tullymore itself, yes.

80
00:06:04,379 --> 00:06:07,084
And... how many are living there now?

81
00:06:07,173 --> 00:06:09,249
There's fifty-two precisely.

82
00:06:09,342 --> 00:06:15,214
If you've not won, I've not won, and Annie's
not won, that leaves a total of forty-nine.

83
00:06:15,306 --> 00:06:17,382
Jesus, forty-nine!

84
00:06:17,474 --> 00:06:19,550
And one is a winner.

85
00:06:20,227 --> 00:06:24,355
- Has the news reached Tullymore?
- Nobody's figured it out yet,...

86
00:06:24,439 --> 00:06:26,681
.. so nobody knows but the winner.

87
00:06:26,775 --> 00:06:29,016
God, it's mighty, Jackie!

88
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:31,399
- Does Annie know?
- She does.

89
00:06:31,487 --> 00:06:33,646
She's looking for the winner now.

90
00:06:37,034 --> 00:06:39,607
# If a goose comes along

91
00:06:39,703 --> 00:06:42,276
# To sing her song

92
00:06:42,372 --> 00:06:44,531
# Then I light a fire

93
00:06:44,624 --> 00:06:47,744
# With a big pot on

94
00:06:48,795 --> 00:06:52,211
Well, you're blessed with
a grand voice, Mrs Kennedy.

95
00:06:52,298 --> 00:06:56,627
How long can a man sit on a fortune
without spending a penny, Jackie?

96
00:06:56,719 --> 00:07:01,131
As long as he wants, Michael.
The longer it's sat on, the bigger our share.

97
00:07:05,644 --> 00:07:08,514
Jesus, man! Where is it from?

98
00:07:08,605 --> 00:07:11,522
- Does it suit me, Maggie?
- It does at that.

99
00:07:11,608 --> 00:07:15,272
- Will you marry me, then?
- Oh! Da!

100
00:07:15,361 --> 00:07:17,852
Brendy, can I marry your daughter now?

101
00:07:17,947 --> 00:07:20,070
It must be stolen, that!

102
00:07:20,157 --> 00:07:23,074
- Come for a ride like the old days.
- Finn, darling,...

103
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:26,445
.. you know I would,
if it wasn't for the smell of the pigs.

104
00:07:26,538 --> 00:07:31,330
What about me young man there? Maurice,
will you come for a ride in the racing car?

105
00:07:31,418 --> 00:07:33,493
- Grampy, can I go?
- No!

106
00:07:33,586 --> 00:07:34,749
Please!

107
00:07:34,837 --> 00:07:38,538
- Brendy, is my puncture mended?
- Come back tomorrow.

108
00:07:38,633 --> 00:07:41,123
I could have done it quicker myself.

109
00:07:41,218 --> 00:07:46,509
Find the winner and make sure we are their
best friends when they cash the cheque!

110
00:07:55,481 --> 00:07:58,151
- Come on, then!
- I'm not sure.

111
00:07:58,234 --> 00:08:02,278
- So you think it's a woman?
- I'm just saying it might be.

112
00:08:02,363 --> 00:08:08,282
If it's a woman, I'll chat her up
and we'll be off before you knew it!

113
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:13,785
I'm bursting with news!
I think I know who's won.

114
00:08:13,873 --> 00:08:17,040
That's mighty, for I've an idea I know myself.

115
00:08:17,126 --> 00:08:22,084
- Annie, what's the noise?
- It's Michael. And he knows the winner.

116
00:08:22,173 --> 00:08:25,008
Well, come on, I want to hear it up here, so!

117
00:08:25,092 --> 00:08:30,845
Jesus, Jackie, do you think you're the Pope?
Shouting for the whole village to hear!

118
00:08:33,308 --> 00:08:35,384
Well, come on. Out with it.

119
00:08:35,477 --> 00:08:38,810
- It's Mrs Kennedy.
- Oh, now, I've got someone else.

120
00:08:39,439 --> 00:08:42,108
- Well, speak up, man.
- Pig Finn.

121
00:08:42,191 --> 00:08:47,529
Would you look at that! There's 49 possible
winners, and we're down to two already.

122
00:08:50,449 --> 00:08:52,322
We're in the bath!

123
00:08:54,578 --> 00:08:57,413
Jackie, it's Finn. Are you up for a pint?

124
00:08:57,497 --> 00:08:59,288
I need your advice.

125
00:08:59,374 --> 00:09:02,577
- He's after advice on his money.
- Say you will.

126
00:09:02,668 --> 00:09:04,661
Aye, Finn, I'm up for a pint.

127
00:09:04,754 --> 00:09:07,920
I'm just out of me bath.
I'll see you at Fitzgerald's...

128
00:09:08,007 --> 00:09:10,083
...in ten minutes.

129
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:11,207
Right.

130
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:15,965
I'd noticed a terrible stink on him lately.

131
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:18,381
- Evening, Jackie. Michael.
- Boys.

132
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:21,180
Dennis, have you seen Pig Finn?

133
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:24,768
His glass is there and himself is in the toilet.

134
00:09:24,856 --> 00:09:30,525
- Two pints, and one for my old friend Finn.
- Oh, and his favourite Mexican crisps...

135
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:32,153
.. as well, Dennis.

136
00:09:32,237 --> 00:09:37,741
You must be needing an operation on your
nose, Jackie. Have you smelt the pig lately?

137
00:09:37,826 --> 00:09:41,325
I have. It's not half as bad
as the smell of your aftershave.

138
00:09:42,789 --> 00:09:46,157
Well, this aftershave
is a knockout with the girls.

139
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:52,253
And tell me, Pat... which particular girls
are you knocking out at the moment?

140
00:09:52,339 --> 00:09:53,999
Hm.

141
00:09:55,884 --> 00:10:01,424
Well, hello, Mrs Kennedy! Don't be afraid,
it's only myself. I've been baking.

142
00:10:01,514 --> 00:10:04,717
Jackie had no room for this,
so I thought we'd share it.

143
00:10:06,644 --> 00:10:08,767
There's the man!

144
00:10:08,854 --> 00:10:11,808
- How are you, boys?
- How are you?

145
00:10:11,899 --> 00:10:14,769
- I'm grand.
- The old sparkle in your eye, eh?

146
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:18,229
Ah, you're a devil, Jackie.
Jesus, Jackie, you must have...

147
00:10:18,322 --> 00:10:22,236
.. a terrible thirst on you tonight
to drink two pints at the same time.

148
00:10:22,325 --> 00:10:26,275
- Here, this is yours, Finn. I bought you a pint.
- You're joking me.

149
00:10:26,371 --> 00:10:27,402
No.

150
00:10:27,497 --> 00:10:30,070
You never bought me a pint.

151
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:32,870
Go away with you!
I brought you home many a night.

152
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:37,123
And I bought you a packet
of your favourite Mexican crisps.

153
00:10:37,214 --> 00:10:42,635
And no offence now, Finn...
I bought you some expensive fruity soaps.

154
00:10:42,719 --> 00:10:44,795
Take them home and try them out.

155
00:10:48,349 --> 00:10:50,425
Ah, boys, what are you up to?

156
00:10:50,518 --> 00:10:53,851
Nothing. Can I not buy you a pint?

157
00:10:53,938 --> 00:10:56,179
Did you come into some money, Jackie?

158
00:10:56,273 --> 00:10:57,933
No!

159
00:10:58,025 --> 00:11:01,061
But you'd be the first to share it if I had, Finn.

160
00:11:02,362 --> 00:11:04,022
Right.

161
00:11:08,034 --> 00:11:11,154
Where have you been, woman?
I've been in bed an hour.

162
00:11:11,245 --> 00:11:13,119
Ah, shut up.

163
00:11:13,205 --> 00:11:16,040
- You're drunk.
- I am not!

164
00:11:16,167 --> 00:11:18,206
What's the news?

165
00:11:18,294 --> 00:11:21,164
I spent ten pounds on Finn,...

166
00:11:21,672 --> 00:11:26,380
.. and all he wanted was advice
on his sick pig.

167
00:11:26,468 --> 00:11:28,544
- Huh!
- Was the sports car his?

168
00:11:28,636 --> 00:11:31,803
Not at all. He's looking after it for his brother.

169
00:11:32,682 --> 00:11:37,842
Then I spent another forty on the locals
in case the winner was hidden among them.

170
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:46,101
- You're acting like you won the lottery.
- Aye. Rockefeller, that's me!

171
00:11:48,196 --> 00:11:51,150
I followed my nose to Mrs Kennedy's.

172
00:11:51,324 --> 00:11:54,657
- And I took a meat pie to soften her up.
- Go on.

173
00:11:55,453 --> 00:11:58,619
Found her on her own... drinking champagne.

174
00:11:58,706 --> 00:12:00,782
- It's her, then.
- Hold on.

175
00:12:00,874 --> 00:12:05,832
No sooner was my meat pie in her belly
than she tells me that her daughter's belly's...

176
00:12:05,921 --> 00:12:11,128
.. filled up with a new baby. That's why
she was singing. Sure, she's over the moon!

177
00:12:11,217 --> 00:12:13,293
Lord, would you look at that!

178
00:12:13,386 --> 00:12:17,549
We're already fifty pounds
and one meat pie lighter!

179
00:12:18,099 --> 00:12:20,305
You're not getting your toaster, Lizzy!

180
00:12:20,392 --> 00:12:24,604
I'm an old, disabled person
with no money, Fitzgerald.

181
00:12:24,688 --> 00:12:26,764
And you're taking advantage.

182
00:12:26,857 --> 00:12:30,060
Your toaster is mended,
but you've got to pay for it!

183
00:12:30,151 --> 00:12:32,477
You're ripping me off, Fitzgerald!

184
00:12:32,612 --> 00:12:35,399
I'm fed up with you
taking without paying, woman!

185
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:37,447
Get out of my way!

186
00:12:37,533 --> 00:12:39,609
You little gobshite!

187
00:12:41,287 --> 00:12:43,363
Morning, boys. How's the heads?

188
00:12:43,455 --> 00:12:47,204
- Oh, we were heavy drunk last night!
- The whole bar was,...

189
00:12:47,292 --> 00:12:51,242
.. thanks to you. There's a rumour
you've come into some money.

190
00:12:51,338 --> 00:12:53,414
What? Huh?

191
00:12:54,382 --> 00:12:55,960
Oh, janey mack!

192
00:12:56,050 --> 00:13:00,297
I wish I had. No, I was just treating
me friends with the little I've got.

193
00:13:00,388 --> 00:13:04,171
I came over to make sure
I'd settled up for those last few rounds.

194
00:13:04,266 --> 00:13:06,342
Go on! On you go.

195
00:13:08,395 --> 00:13:09,474
Good luck.

196
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,476
Morning, Annie.

197
00:13:18,029 --> 00:13:20,436
That Mrs Kennedy...

198
00:13:20,531 --> 00:13:22,689
.. is a fine one for the champagne.

199
00:13:23,784 --> 00:13:28,660
I thought it would be you boys that
would have the heads this morning, not me.

200
00:13:28,747 --> 00:13:30,905
We do have heads and they are sore.

201
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:35,954
But at the same time
filled with the very best of Irish brains.

202
00:13:37,005 --> 00:13:40,255
- Will those dead chickens find the winner?
- They will.

203
00:13:40,341 --> 00:13:45,050
Jackie talked Mrs Kennedy into giving us
a list of the regular lotto players.

204
00:13:45,137 --> 00:13:49,384
There's eighteen, and each of those
will be invited to a chicken supper.

205
00:13:49,475 --> 00:13:53,057
We'll sit them down,
feed them up, and then find the winner.

206
00:14:01,819 --> 00:14:03,278
Yoo-hoo!

207
00:14:05,573 --> 00:14:08,906
It's not me Christmas card already,
is it, Michael?

208
00:14:08,993 --> 00:14:13,239
- Christmas has come early this year, Kitty.
- How exciting!

209
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:15,406
Come in, Michael, come in.

210
00:14:15,499 --> 00:14:17,491
I've been baking!

211
00:14:17,584 --> 00:14:21,961
It's tempting, Kitty,
but I've more cards to deliver.

212
00:14:22,046 --> 00:14:24,454
Is it a little love note, Michael?

213
00:14:27,843 --> 00:14:29,919
What are you up to?

214
00:14:30,763 --> 00:14:33,088
- Been writing.
- Ah, Maggie,...

215
00:14:33,182 --> 00:14:37,428
- .. will you read me some of your poetry?
- Jesus, Finn, that's not poetry.

216
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:41,053
It's just words for a greeting card.
There's a big difference.

217
00:14:41,147 --> 00:14:43,223
Ah, it's poetry to me.

218
00:14:43,316 --> 00:14:47,776
My cards are bought by men
on their way home from work.

219
00:14:47,862 --> 00:14:51,112
They never even read what I've written inside.

220
00:14:51,198 --> 00:14:53,274
I read them!

221
00:14:53,367 --> 00:14:56,486
- Go on, Maggs, read us one.
- No!

222
00:14:56,954 --> 00:15:00,073
- Ah, will you go on, now?
- I can't.

223
00:15:00,665 --> 00:15:02,741
Make my heart sing.

224
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:06,709
Ah, go on, Maggs, just the one.
Just for me. Please...

225
00:15:06,796 --> 00:15:10,165
- Promise you won't laugh?
- I certainly will not!

226
00:15:15,387 --> 00:15:17,214
"Sometimes... "

227
00:15:17,306 --> 00:15:19,049
No, "sometimes" is good.

228
00:15:19,141 --> 00:15:21,631
"Sometimes" - it's a lovely start.

229
00:15:21,726 --> 00:15:23,933
Go on.

230
00:15:27,273 --> 00:15:29,515
"Sometimes...

231
00:15:29,609 --> 00:15:31,685
.. some things are special. "

232
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,195
"Sometimes...

233
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,355
.. someone is close. "

234
00:15:36,907 --> 00:15:40,027
"Sometimes you feel you'll never quite say...

235
00:15:41,495 --> 00:15:44,531
.. the somethings that matter... the most. "

236
00:15:44,622 --> 00:15:46,698
That's poetry, Maggie.

237
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:49,408
You've a real talent there.

238
00:15:49,502 --> 00:15:52,668
It's bollocks, Finn.
A bit of extra cash is all it is.

239
00:15:58,218 --> 00:16:00,377
I've been using fruity soaps, Maggie.

240
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:02,546
I've noticed.

241
00:16:04,015 --> 00:16:06,091
Well, come on, then.

242
00:16:08,102 --> 00:16:10,178
Let's get closer.

243
00:16:11,105 --> 00:16:13,181
Oh, yes, please, Maggie.

244
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:20,812
It's been a long time, hasn't it, Finn?

245
00:16:20,906 --> 00:16:24,072
If it weren't for the pigs,
we'd be settled by now.

246
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:26,484
- We might.
- The pigs is all you know.

247
00:16:26,578 --> 00:16:30,907
- Can we forget the pigs for the moment?
- I know, but if it weren't for the pigs...

248
00:16:30,999 --> 00:16:33,952
- Can we get closer, Maggie?
- We can.

249
00:16:34,043 --> 00:16:39,037
- But I can't wait for ever is what I'm saying.
- I know, darling. Come on.

250
00:16:39,632 --> 00:16:40,876
Ah, Finn,...

251
00:16:41,925 --> 00:16:44,001
.. I have missed you.

252
00:16:47,472 --> 00:16:49,963
- You could work with my dad.
- He hates me.

253
00:16:50,058 --> 00:16:52,679
- In Fitzgerald's, then.
- He doesn't need anyone.

254
00:16:52,769 --> 00:16:56,848
- There must be something you're good at.
- Come here and I'll show you, girl.

255
00:16:56,939 --> 00:16:59,015
Come on, Maggie!

256
00:17:05,572 --> 00:17:10,115
- I caught a whiff of something then.
- Oh, no, it's peaches. Peach soaps, Maggie.

257
00:17:10,201 --> 00:17:12,277
Oh, no.

258
00:17:13,246 --> 00:17:16,365
- It's something else.
- Could be strawberries.

259
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:19,202
Oh,...

260
00:17:19,293 --> 00:17:20,372
.. Finn!

261
00:17:20,461 --> 00:17:22,370
Oh, Maggie!

262
00:17:22,463 --> 00:17:24,539
- Finn...
- Maggie...

263
00:17:24,631 --> 00:17:26,707
Finn!

264
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:31,465
Oh, no, I'm sorry, love, it's still there.

265
00:17:31,554 --> 00:17:32,799
No, Maggs!

266
00:17:32,889 --> 00:17:35,759
- No, Maggie, please, no!
- No, no, I'm sorry.

267
00:17:36,476 --> 00:17:41,221
- What can you play?
- Nothing, really. I just like messing around.

268
00:17:41,313 --> 00:17:45,940
- Can you play songs by Jesus?
- No. I wish I could.

269
00:17:47,736 --> 00:17:49,812
So, did he come to you, then?

270
00:17:49,905 --> 00:17:52,692
- Who's that?
- Jesus.

271
00:17:52,782 --> 00:17:54,858
Oh, Jesus.

272
00:17:55,785 --> 00:17:58,490
Well, he did in many ways, yes.

273
00:17:58,579 --> 00:18:00,371
Did you see him?

274
00:18:00,456 --> 00:18:02,947
Well, not exactly, no.

275
00:18:03,042 --> 00:18:06,042
But... you're working for him.

276
00:18:06,128 --> 00:18:08,879
I am. Doing the best I can.

277
00:18:08,964 --> 00:18:10,921
Do you get paid for it?

278
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:15,254
Well, it's more a payment
of the spiritual kind, Maurice.

279
00:18:15,345 --> 00:18:17,302
Oh, right.

280
00:18:17,388 --> 00:18:19,511
Think you could be drawn to the Church?

281
00:18:20,725 --> 00:18:23,050
- I don't think so.
- Well, you never know.

282
00:18:23,144 --> 00:18:27,770
I don't think I could work for someone
I'd never met, and not get paid for it.

283
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:41,068
- Did you enjoy your supper, Michael?
- I did indeed, Kitty.

284
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,532
It was generous of Jackie to splash out.

285
00:18:43,621 --> 00:18:45,697
Oh, he's a generous man, Kitty.

286
00:18:56,341 --> 00:18:58,001
Oh, grand.

287
00:19:00,803 --> 00:19:05,963
Did you see Pig Finn in his brother's
racing car this week, Brendy?

288
00:19:06,058 --> 00:19:07,766
I did!

289
00:19:07,852 --> 00:19:09,927
I thought it was stolen!

290
00:19:12,064 --> 00:19:13,522
Now, Jackie,...

291
00:19:13,607 --> 00:19:18,103
.. they tell me you might be
splashing out on a sports car yourself.

292
00:19:18,194 --> 00:19:22,239
If I had the money, I wouldn't
waste it on a car when my bike's outside.

293
00:19:22,323 --> 00:19:24,363
- How about yourself?
- What?

294
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:27,486
Will you be splashing out on a sports car?

295
00:19:28,621 --> 00:19:30,697
Are you mad, man?!

296
00:19:31,999 --> 00:19:34,075
Just asking.

297
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:40,583
Tom, would you be looking for a bigger
house now that you've had your baby?

298
00:19:40,674 --> 00:19:42,381
So, Kitty,...

299
00:19:42,467 --> 00:19:46,630
- .. how did you like your breast?
- My breast, Annie, was tasty.

300
00:19:46,721 --> 00:19:48,215
Ah...

301
00:19:48,306 --> 00:19:51,591
So tell us, are you going
to take a holiday this year?

302
00:19:51,684 --> 00:19:55,052
- Where would I get the money for a holiday?
- Sorry, girls.

303
00:19:55,145 --> 00:19:57,814
- Ah, Dennis, help yourself.
- There we go.

304
00:19:57,898 --> 00:20:02,725
- I see you've got a little bit put away, then?
- No, but I've started saving.

305
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:16,906
Am I smelling sweeter, Jackie?

306
00:20:16,999 --> 00:20:20,830
- I tried one of your banana soaps.
- Not sweet enough by the looks of it.

307
00:20:22,128 --> 00:20:24,702
Ah! That's my girl!

308
00:20:24,798 --> 00:20:28,665
There's a raspberry soap upstairs.
Try that tomorrow, huh?

309
00:20:29,886 --> 00:20:32,507
- Raspberry.
- Yes, raspberry. Try that.

310
00:20:33,931 --> 00:20:37,631
Jackie, am I right in thinking
you've booked a Caribbean cruise?

311
00:20:37,726 --> 00:20:41,973
If I had the money, I wouldn't spend it
floating around the Caribbean...

312
00:20:42,063 --> 00:20:44,519
.. when I can float in the cove for free.

313
00:20:44,607 --> 00:20:46,683
For Christ's sake, Jackie,...

314
00:20:46,776 --> 00:20:52,114
.. would you mind telling us what you would
be spending your money on, if you had any,...

315
00:20:52,198 --> 00:20:53,229
.. that is.

316
00:20:53,324 --> 00:20:57,653
Well, I'd take what I needed, Pat,
and treat my friends with the rest!

317
00:21:07,295 --> 00:21:09,667
# At least when I asked them

318
00:21:09,756 --> 00:21:12,329
# That's what I was told

319
00:21:12,425 --> 00:21:17,336
# So I took a hand in this digging for gold

320
00:21:17,429 --> 00:21:20,264
# But for all I have found there

321
00:21:20,349 --> 00:21:23,552
# I might as well be

322
00:21:23,643 --> 00:21:27,392
# Where the Mountains of Mourne

323
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:32,308
# Sweep down to the sea

324
00:21:44,037 --> 00:21:48,829
Oh, japers, the... chickens and
the whiskey were wasted!

325
00:21:58,384 --> 00:22:00,460
What are you staring at?

326
00:22:00,553 --> 00:22:02,628
I wasn't staring at anything.

327
00:22:02,721 --> 00:22:04,595
Come on, out with it.

328
00:22:04,681 --> 00:22:08,809
I know who it is. I've worked it out.

329
00:22:08,894 --> 00:22:11,266
- No!
- Oh, yes.

330
00:22:11,354 --> 00:22:12,682
Go on.

331
00:22:12,772 --> 00:22:14,765
- It's you.
- Me?

332
00:22:14,857 --> 00:22:16,933
I think it's you...

333
00:22:17,026 --> 00:22:19,433
.. and I think you're having us all on.

334
00:22:21,614 --> 00:22:23,653
Michael... go home!

335
00:22:23,741 --> 00:22:27,987
I'll leave you in peace
to count your winnings.

336
00:22:29,996 --> 00:22:32,072
Here, wait a minute...

337
00:22:32,832 --> 00:22:36,331
What if it's you? You never said it wasn't.

338
00:22:45,302 --> 00:22:47,378
Get home! You're drunk.

339
00:22:48,013 --> 00:22:51,962
Get to your bed. Get yourself a hot chocolate.

340
00:22:57,230 --> 00:22:59,306
Get home, you hoodlum!

341
00:23:05,696 --> 00:23:07,605
Stupid eejit!

342
00:23:10,993 --> 00:23:13,566
I've a chicken leg left over.

343
00:23:13,662 --> 00:23:17,789
Oh, I'm full, Annie.
Put it in the fridge for dinner tomorrow.

344
00:23:17,874 --> 00:23:23,460
I counted those joints precisely. If there's a
leg left over it means someone was missing.

345
00:23:23,546 --> 00:23:26,250
The winner smelt a rat?

346
00:23:28,467 --> 00:23:30,543
Where's my list?

347
00:23:32,471 --> 00:23:35,388
Ned Devine! Ned Devine was missing.

348
00:23:35,473 --> 00:23:38,047
God, Annie, did you not notice?

349
00:23:38,143 --> 00:23:40,764
Make up a dinner, sweetheart, I'm going over.

350
00:23:59,037 --> 00:24:01,913
Ned!

351
00:24:01,998 --> 00:24:04,240
I've brought you a chicken dinner!

352
00:24:07,545 --> 00:24:09,205
Ned?

353
00:24:10,297 --> 00:24:12,539
I've brought you a chicken supper.

354
00:24:29,648 --> 00:24:32,400
Ned? Ned, are you in there?

355
00:24:36,655 --> 00:24:38,113
Ned?

356
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:40,150
Ned?

357
00:24:41,326 --> 00:24:43,402
Are you in there, Ned?

358
00:25:07,517 --> 00:25:09,593
Dear God!

359
00:25:29,871 --> 00:25:33,037
You'll be cursing in heaven tonight,...

360
00:25:33,124 --> 00:25:35,033
.. Ned Devine.

361
00:25:40,756 --> 00:25:42,665
They match.

362
00:25:43,466 --> 00:25:45,542
It's a winner.

363
00:25:45,635 --> 00:25:47,711
At least a half a million.

364
00:25:49,639 --> 00:25:51,715
He'd have spent it too.

365
00:25:51,807 --> 00:25:53,966
There'd have been a mighty party.

366
00:25:55,895 --> 00:25:58,432
Is there a greater twist of fate, Annie?

367
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:03,651
To win half a million, and the next minute
die from the shock of it.

368
00:26:04,569 --> 00:26:07,356
God rest him, the poor fella.

369
00:26:09,032 --> 00:26:10,490
Ned,...

370
00:26:10,575 --> 00:26:12,651
.. the sweetest man in the world.

371
00:26:14,287 --> 00:26:16,694
They say money changes a man, Jackie.

372
00:26:16,789 --> 00:26:20,833
And there's no greater change
than moving him from life into death.

373
00:26:20,918 --> 00:26:22,994
It's the cruellest twist.

374
00:26:24,713 --> 00:26:26,789
Half a million pounds!

375
00:26:30,093 --> 00:26:33,675
Should we be phoning
the police or the doctor?

376
00:26:33,763 --> 00:26:37,262
It's a call to both,
but there's nothing to do tonight.

377
00:26:37,767 --> 00:26:40,969
His bedroom's as cold
as any fridge they'd put him in.

378
00:26:41,061 --> 00:26:43,137
Make the calls in the morning.

379
00:26:53,197 --> 00:26:56,780
I think we should make room
in this day for some prayers.

380
00:27:03,874 --> 00:27:07,741
God bless mothers and fathers,
and grandparents, too,...

381
00:27:07,836 --> 00:27:10,457
.. aunties and uncles, friends old and new.

382
00:27:11,297 --> 00:27:12,957
Amen.

383
00:27:13,633 --> 00:27:15,709
And dear Lord,...

384
00:27:15,802 --> 00:27:19,253
.. we pray tonight
for a little man from Tullymore,...

385
00:27:19,347 --> 00:27:21,588
.. Ned Devine.

386
00:27:21,682 --> 00:27:23,924
As sweet a soul as ever was blessed.

387
00:27:25,144 --> 00:27:26,519
A gentleman...

388
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:28,311
.. who loved his life...

389
00:27:28,397 --> 00:27:32,346
.. and carried a heart the size of his head
within his chest.

390
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:35,609
- Amen.
- Amen.

391
00:27:47,122 --> 00:27:53,290
# Lux eterna

392
00:27:54,462 --> 00:28:03,003
# Luceat eis, Domine

393
00:28:17,317 --> 00:28:19,393
It's delicious!

394
00:28:26,742 --> 00:28:29,909
There would've been a mighty party, Jackie.

395
00:28:29,995 --> 00:28:33,945
Yeah. There would indeed.

396
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:37,290
Would you... would you...
would you like some chicken?

397
00:28:37,377 --> 00:28:40,331
No, thanks, Ned.

398
00:28:40,421 --> 00:28:42,710
Are you sure?

399
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:45,669
Are you angry?

400
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,215
Not at all!

401
00:28:48,304 --> 00:28:52,301
Are you sure you wouldn't like
some chicken? It's delicious.

402
00:28:52,391 --> 00:28:54,467
No, thanks, Ned.

403
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:56,635
I'm full.

404
00:28:57,604 --> 00:29:00,723
- Where are we going, Ned?
- Into the light.

405
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:06,186
It seems far off.

406
00:29:08,114 --> 00:29:10,521
Aye, but don't worry, man.

407
00:29:10,616 --> 00:29:13,023
The tide'll bring us there safely.

408
00:29:24,962 --> 00:29:27,251
It's a premonition, Michael!

409
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:30,257
- A vision!
- It's a chicken dinner, Jackie!

410
00:29:30,968 --> 00:29:34,087
It's obvious, Michael.
He wants us to claim the money!

411
00:29:34,179 --> 00:29:37,097
Share the chicken dinner! Share the winnings!

412
00:29:37,182 --> 00:29:39,258
What a great man he was!

413
00:29:39,351 --> 00:29:43,514
- Yeah, and his spirit's in my head!
- What'll you do with the ticket?

414
00:29:43,605 --> 00:29:46,558
He wrote his name on the back,
but we pretend to be Ned...

415
00:29:46,649 --> 00:29:49,816
- .. and we claim the half million.
- I'm not sure, Jackie.

416
00:29:49,902 --> 00:29:53,069
I couldn't be Ned. I'm no good at pretending.

417
00:29:53,155 --> 00:29:54,898
I'll be Ned myself.

418
00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:56,650
Michael,...

419
00:29:56,742 --> 00:30:01,699
.. Ned's no family. The money'll go unclaimed.
He plays the lotto all his life,...

420
00:30:01,788 --> 00:30:06,248
.. and dies from the shock of winning it.
Can you imagine the anger of his spirit?

421
00:30:06,334 --> 00:30:09,204
Does Annie know
we're going back up tonight?

422
00:30:09,295 --> 00:30:12,415
No, no, she's left cuddling my pillow.

423
00:30:12,506 --> 00:30:15,590
Do we report the death in the morning?

424
00:30:15,676 --> 00:30:21,262
Are you thick? If we report it and are found to
be claiming, we'll be questioned for murder!

425
00:30:21,348 --> 00:30:24,882
Murder is a mighty word
to use at this time of night, Jackie.

426
00:30:24,976 --> 00:30:28,676
Yeah, well, I'm sorry if it
gives you the willies, Michael.

427
00:30:35,361 --> 00:30:37,437
Watch the step.

428
00:30:53,085 --> 00:30:55,161
Where is he, Jackie?

429
00:30:55,254 --> 00:30:57,330
Through there. Take a look.

430
00:31:08,933 --> 00:31:11,638
Jesus, there's a stink in here!

431
00:31:14,522 --> 00:31:18,566
Ah, nature's taking a hold, Michael.
He's been gone a few days now.

432
00:31:20,194 --> 00:31:21,902
Jackie,...

433
00:31:21,987 --> 00:31:24,063
.. he's smiling.

434
00:31:24,156 --> 00:31:26,362
That'll be the winning smile!

435
00:31:26,449 --> 00:31:28,821
With a little luck, we'll have one too.

436
00:31:28,910 --> 00:31:32,824
And I always thought
it would be the sea that would take him.

437
00:31:32,914 --> 00:31:35,618
He survived all those storms,...

438
00:31:35,708 --> 00:31:39,326
.. only to be swept away by a few lottery balls.

439
00:31:49,763 --> 00:31:51,138
Jackie!

440
00:31:51,222 --> 00:31:52,633
Come quick!

441
00:31:52,724 --> 00:31:55,559
Sweet Jesus, the man's beginning to melt!

442
00:31:58,938 --> 00:31:59,969
Argh!

443
00:32:01,398 --> 00:32:04,897
Oh, dear God,
you've slipped on his intestines!

444
00:32:04,985 --> 00:32:06,942
Get up!

445
00:32:07,029 --> 00:32:10,278
For God's sake, Jackie!
Jackie, for the love of God,...

446
00:32:10,365 --> 00:32:12,986
- .. will you stop it!
- Oh, be calm, Michael.

447
00:32:13,076 --> 00:32:15,401
It's only a chicken dinner.

448
00:32:15,495 --> 00:32:17,452
A chicken dinner?

449
00:32:17,538 --> 00:32:20,409
God, I thought it was his intestines!

450
00:32:20,499 --> 00:32:24,200
Well, I've never smelt intestines
on my jacket before,...

451
00:32:24,294 --> 00:32:27,461
.. but it can't be as bad as
Annie's Brussels sprouts.

452
00:32:36,139 --> 00:32:38,464
- Come on, you missed a bit.
- Oh, God!

453
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:42,219
The floor will need to be
cleaned proper before we go.

454
00:32:42,311 --> 00:32:44,719
- What time is it?
- Ten to five.

455
00:32:44,813 --> 00:32:48,977
- Now that the morning's on its way...
- Can you clean up the chicken dinner?

456
00:32:49,067 --> 00:32:51,558
There are two things to do before we go,...

457
00:32:51,653 --> 00:32:55,152
.. and the chicken dinner's
by far the least gruesome.

458
00:33:00,453 --> 00:33:02,529
Is it necessary, Jackie?

459
00:33:04,373 --> 00:33:07,409
Well, it's sort of unnatural as it is, Michael.

460
00:33:13,465 --> 00:33:15,588
Take hold of his mouth.

461
00:33:15,675 --> 00:33:20,088
- You won't get rid of his smile like that.
- Ah, you think you're awful smart.

462
00:33:20,179 --> 00:33:22,255
Leave me in peace.

463
00:33:22,348 --> 00:33:25,432
Finish wiping those intestines from the floor.

464
00:33:30,689 --> 00:33:33,180
What expression were you thinking of?

465
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:37,648
Be quiet! I'm trying to...

466
00:33:41,074 --> 00:33:41,904
Ah!

467
00:33:41,991 --> 00:33:44,316
God Almighty!

468
00:33:46,704 --> 00:33:49,325
Dear God! Here.

469
00:33:49,415 --> 00:33:50,909
Ah, come on!

470
00:33:50,999 --> 00:33:52,743
For God's sake, Jackie!

471
00:33:53,961 --> 00:33:56,712
Stop, you're... You're panicking me, man!

472
00:33:58,298 --> 00:34:00,374
You're panicking me!

473
00:34:00,717 --> 00:34:03,753
- Now, watch he doesn't bite again.
- Oh, shush!

474
00:34:14,354 --> 00:34:17,688
No, it's... it's not natural. It's too grim.

475
00:34:17,774 --> 00:34:20,265
You're right there.

476
00:34:21,069 --> 00:34:23,357
It's in his eyes, Jackie.

477
00:34:28,826 --> 00:34:29,857
Ah, yeah.

478
00:34:29,952 --> 00:34:31,612
Yeah.

479
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:40,666
You're doing a fine job there, Brendy.

480
00:34:40,754 --> 00:34:42,331
Hello there!

481
00:34:42,422 --> 00:34:44,829
- That was a storm, wasn't it?
- Oh, it was.

482
00:34:44,924 --> 00:34:47,000
Is Maggie around?

483
00:34:47,093 --> 00:34:50,960
- She's having a bit of a lie-in after last night.
- Oh, right.

484
00:34:51,722 --> 00:34:54,758
Well, look, Brendy, I'll get straight in here.

485
00:34:55,809 --> 00:34:58,430
I spent some time
with your daughter last night.

486
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:01,390
I don't know how you feel
about Finn, but I think...

487
00:35:01,481 --> 00:35:05,395
- .. she deserves a lot more than a pig farmer.
- Oh, Finn's not so bad.

488
00:35:06,653 --> 00:35:09,570
No, he's not. You're right there.
He's a good man.

489
00:35:09,655 --> 00:35:15,491
But look at what I've got to offer, Brendy.
I've inherited the farm now.

490
00:35:15,577 --> 00:35:21,117
I'm up there, rattling around on my own.
I could look after Maggie and little Maurice.

491
00:35:22,167 --> 00:35:25,915
I'm looking to settle down.
Plenty of girls would jump at the chance.

492
00:35:26,004 --> 00:35:29,337
You're very much like your father,
aren't you, Pat?

493
00:35:29,424 --> 00:35:32,958
Well, now, Brendy,
I'll take that as a compliment.

494
00:35:33,052 --> 00:35:36,800
He was always after my wife,
right up till we were married.

495
00:35:36,930 --> 00:35:40,264
And as I remember... he didn't stop there.

496
00:35:40,350 --> 00:35:46,851
Ah, well, that just goes to show that you both
had good taste, doesn't it? Look, Brendy,...

497
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:49,976
.. I know I've always had a bit of a...

498
00:35:50,068 --> 00:35:52,772
.. reputation with the ladies and that.

499
00:35:54,071 --> 00:35:57,689
But this is different, Brendy. This is serious.

500
00:35:57,783 --> 00:36:03,323
Maggie would want for nothing. There'd be
no other women. She'd be well looked after.

501
00:36:03,413 --> 00:36:07,363
She could stay in the village.
She'd be here if you needed her.

502
00:36:08,334 --> 00:36:10,410
What do you think?

503
00:36:12,922 --> 00:36:15,876
Come on, girl, come on!

504
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:20,000
Here you are, Lizzy. Have your choice.

505
00:36:24,016 --> 00:36:27,680
- Lizzy, stop squeezing the bread!
- 'Tis all stale, anyway.

506
00:36:27,769 --> 00:36:31,138
It certainly is not!
It came in fresh this morning.

507
00:36:31,231 --> 00:36:35,976
I'll take two loaves,
and pay half price due to the staleness.

508
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:44,483
Ah, japers,...

509
00:36:44,576 --> 00:36:46,652
.. Annie is livid.

510
00:36:46,745 --> 00:36:50,694
- Did she give you an earful?
- She did. She locked me in me room.

511
00:36:50,790 --> 00:36:54,622
She said we should never
have gone back up last night.

512
00:36:54,711 --> 00:36:57,877
She said we're too old for prison.

513
00:36:57,964 --> 00:37:00,537
Maybe we should stop it all now, Jackie.

514
00:37:00,633 --> 00:37:03,040
Come on, man, what do you say?

515
00:37:03,135 --> 00:37:05,211
No, I'm all prepared. Come on.

516
00:37:23,028 --> 00:37:26,195
- What's in the bag?
- I pinched these from his house last night.

517
00:37:26,281 --> 00:37:29,780
They're all Ned's documents -
birth certificates and stuff.

518
00:37:29,868 --> 00:37:32,619
Hello? National Lotto. Maureen speaking.

519
00:37:32,704 --> 00:37:37,330
Yes, Maureen, hello.
I'm wanting to talk to someone about a claim.

520
00:37:37,417 --> 00:37:40,536
I suppose it might be the tube,
Dennis, would it?

521
00:37:41,379 --> 00:37:42,837
Have you seen the boys?

522
00:37:42,922 --> 00:37:44,665
Not today, Annie.

523
00:37:44,757 --> 00:37:46,833
Oh, I'll kill them!

524
00:37:49,011 --> 00:37:53,637
Michael, we'll go down to the beach
and get the stories straight.

525
00:37:53,723 --> 00:37:56,048
They're sending a man from Dublin.

526
00:37:56,142 --> 00:38:00,436
- Are they convinced?
- They are, but there's some preparing to do.

527
00:38:00,521 --> 00:38:03,190
I need to spend the night at Ned's...

528
00:38:03,274 --> 00:38:06,607
.. in case the lotto man
comes first thing tomorrow.

529
00:38:17,162 --> 00:38:19,320
What are you looking at, Maurice?

530
00:38:19,414 --> 00:38:24,324
It's amazing how it just goes on and on,
Father, isn't it?

531
00:38:24,418 --> 00:38:27,621
On and on, into the universe and infinity.

532
00:38:27,713 --> 00:38:29,789
Oh, yes, it's a marvel, isn't it?

533
00:38:32,092 --> 00:38:35,258
- How are you, Father?
- Oh, fine, Maurice, you know.

534
00:38:35,345 --> 00:38:37,918
You don't sound so sure there.

535
00:38:38,014 --> 00:38:40,054
Ah, no, it's just that...

536
00:38:40,141 --> 00:38:44,139
It's been a difficult month for me,
coming to a community like this.

537
00:38:44,228 --> 00:38:46,719
If I was here permanently people might be...

538
00:38:46,814 --> 00:38:49,850
- .. more welcoming.
- How much longer have you got?

539
00:38:49,942 --> 00:38:54,520
Father Mulligan should be back from Lourdes
fairly soon, so then I'll be off.

540
00:38:54,613 --> 00:38:56,938
You'll be missed. You've done well.

541
00:38:57,032 --> 00:38:59,949
- No matter what people say.
- Thank you, Maurice.

542
00:39:00,034 --> 00:39:02,323
I like to think I've made an impression.

543
00:39:06,123 --> 00:39:08,365
Go on, ask me another one.

544
00:39:08,459 --> 00:39:10,784
Come on, man, use your imagination!

545
00:39:11,879 --> 00:39:14,666
- How old are you, Ned?
- I'm 66, sir.

546
00:39:15,966 --> 00:39:20,212
- And do you have any family, Ned?
- No, just myself now.

547
00:39:55,836 --> 00:39:57,912
- How's Dublin?
- Foggy.

548
00:39:58,005 --> 00:40:00,211
This is your car. You can drop me off.

549
00:40:05,512 --> 00:40:08,002
Is she fit, Brendy?

550
00:40:08,097 --> 00:40:11,098
Oh! So you're not
in the convertible today, then?

551
00:40:11,183 --> 00:40:13,259
No, I'm not.

552
00:40:13,352 --> 00:40:16,139
Maurice, be careful. There's petrol here!

553
00:40:17,147 --> 00:40:18,891
You're a bad boy!

554
00:40:18,982 --> 00:40:21,603
I told you not to be playing with matches!

555
00:40:23,236 --> 00:40:24,611
God Almighty!

556
00:40:24,696 --> 00:40:25,976
Careful, son!

557
00:40:26,072 --> 00:40:27,732
Sorry, Finn.

558
00:40:28,408 --> 00:40:30,484
Ah, you're all right.

559
00:40:30,618 --> 00:40:33,109
Jesus, Brendy,
keep him away from the petrol!

560
00:40:33,204 --> 00:40:35,280
He needs a father.

561
00:40:35,372 --> 00:40:38,124
- He's too quick for me.
- He needs his real father.

562
00:40:38,208 --> 00:40:42,122
- Maggie needs me too, Brendy.
- Jeez, man, you're not the dad!

563
00:40:42,212 --> 00:40:45,166
I am so, and Maggie knows it.

564
00:40:45,257 --> 00:40:48,091
- What a mess your donkey's making!
- It's a pony.

565
00:40:48,176 --> 00:40:51,758
Christ, man, the stink on your donkey's arse
is almost as bad as yourself.

566
00:40:51,846 --> 00:40:54,419
- Ah, piss off with you.
- And I will at that.

567
00:40:54,515 --> 00:40:57,302
I've a date with Maurice's mother tonight.

568
00:40:57,393 --> 00:40:59,634
- Haven't I, Brendy?
- That's a lie.

569
00:40:59,728 --> 00:41:02,978
Maggie's mine.
We're just discussing it here now.

570
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:06,977
She wanted someone
who could get close enough...

571
00:41:07,068 --> 00:41:09,144
.. to give her what she wants.

572
00:41:14,909 --> 00:41:16,985
Tullymore. Tullymore.

573
00:41:18,287 --> 00:41:20,576
Where is it?

574
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:25,623
So, what are you going to
spend your half on, Jackie?

575
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:28,036
Ah, we agreed half, did we, Michael?

576
00:41:28,755 --> 00:41:30,629
No, I just sort of assumed it.

577
00:41:31,674 --> 00:41:33,750
Oh, you assumed it, did you?

578
00:41:36,053 --> 00:41:37,464
Who's that?

579
00:41:37,555 --> 00:41:39,263
- Hello there!
- Hello.

580
00:41:39,348 --> 00:41:42,302
I think I'm lost.
Do you know where Tullymore is?

581
00:41:42,393 --> 00:41:44,966
You're not far off, mister.

582
00:41:45,062 --> 00:41:50,482
Back up the lane, left at the end,
and it's a long road that has no turning.

583
00:41:50,567 --> 00:41:54,350
- Are you from the village yourself?
- I am. All my life!

584
00:41:54,445 --> 00:41:56,521
Would you know a Ned Devine?

585
00:41:58,157 --> 00:42:01,074
- Ned Devine?
- Ned Devine.

586
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:02,702
Do you know him?

587
00:42:02,786 --> 00:42:04,862
I do.

588
00:42:04,955 --> 00:42:07,956
I do. Is it Ned you're wanting?

589
00:42:08,041 --> 00:42:11,825
- It is, yeah.
- Well, I can take you to Ned Devine's house.

590
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:15,703
That'd be very good of you.
Why don't you jump in the car?

591
00:42:15,798 --> 00:42:17,874
Oh, sweet Jesus!

592
00:42:51,706 --> 00:42:53,082
Atchoo!

593
00:42:53,166 --> 00:42:55,242
Oh, I'm sorry.

594
00:42:55,960 --> 00:43:00,124
Excuse me, it's hay fever.
I get it every time I come down to the country.

595
00:43:00,214 --> 00:43:02,290
Sorry, I'm Jim Kelly.

596
00:43:02,383 --> 00:43:05,300
- Jackie O'Shea. How are you?
- Not too bad, Jackie.

597
00:43:05,386 --> 00:43:07,877
So it's at the end of this road and next left?

598
00:43:07,971 --> 00:43:11,138
Er, no, no, no.
If you're going to Ned's house,...

599
00:43:11,224 --> 00:43:14,558
.. then you'd better turn right
and head back to the hills.

600
00:43:14,644 --> 00:43:16,637
Are you sure?

601
00:43:16,730 --> 00:43:18,805
Sure I'm sure.

602
00:43:18,898 --> 00:43:21,436
Yes, I've... I've been here all my life.

603
00:43:28,532 --> 00:43:32,115
Ah, now, I think there's
a right turn coming up here.

604
00:43:34,121 --> 00:43:37,240
Will you drive a little slower, mister, please?

605
00:43:37,332 --> 00:43:40,416
Sorry, I'll try and take it easier now.

606
00:43:54,389 --> 00:43:56,049
Whoa! Left!

607
00:43:56,850 --> 00:43:58,926
Haven't we just been up here?

608
00:43:59,019 --> 00:44:02,268
It would seem that way,
but that's a different spot.

609
00:44:02,355 --> 00:44:06,767
- Are you having trouble with the directions?
- You're going too fast, yes.

610
00:44:06,859 --> 00:44:09,397
Sorry, I thought I was taking it slower.

611
00:44:09,487 --> 00:44:13,650
It's faster than a walk and I've always
walked these hills in the mist and fog.

612
00:44:21,831 --> 00:44:24,037
There's a left turn. Left turn here!

613
00:44:24,667 --> 00:44:27,703
- No, it's a right turn, I think.
- Left or right?

614
00:44:27,795 --> 00:44:30,203
- No, right, right.
- OK.

615
00:44:40,473 --> 00:44:43,640
- What kind of business are you in?
- Oh, business.

616
00:44:43,726 --> 00:44:45,802
- Business?
- Business.

617
00:44:45,895 --> 00:44:47,971
Yes, business.

618
00:45:05,330 --> 00:45:07,618
Ned! Ned, are you in there?

619
00:45:07,707 --> 00:45:10,280
I brought a man to see you! Ned!

620
00:45:10,877 --> 00:45:12,536
Ned!

621
00:45:13,796 --> 00:45:16,999
I don't think he's in.
I'd best take a look down the village.

622
00:45:17,091 --> 00:45:21,586
No, no. I'll take a look round the back.
He sleeps a lot in the afternoon.

623
00:45:21,678 --> 00:45:23,920
All right.

624
00:45:24,014 --> 00:45:26,089
Come on, pussy.

625
00:45:26,933 --> 00:45:28,593
Atchoo!

626
00:45:35,357 --> 00:45:37,433
Michael! Michael...

627
00:45:37,526 --> 00:45:40,278
- Where are your clothes?!
- There wasn't time!

628
00:45:40,362 --> 00:45:45,273
- We were knocking at the front door!
- I can hear that, but it's all locked up.

629
00:45:45,367 --> 00:45:47,489
Mind yourself.

630
00:45:52,331 --> 00:45:55,202
You're all right. He was taking a bath there.

631
00:45:56,585 --> 00:45:58,245
Atchoo!

632
00:46:00,839 --> 00:46:03,128
Thanks very much for all your help.

633
00:46:03,216 --> 00:46:05,754
Oh, no problem at all. No problem.

634
00:46:20,858 --> 00:46:21,889
Er,...

635
00:46:21,984 --> 00:46:24,060
.. yes?

636
00:46:24,152 --> 00:46:26,643
Ned, I'm sorry to get you out of your bath,...

637
00:46:26,738 --> 00:46:28,814
.. but there's a man to see you.

638
00:46:28,907 --> 00:46:29,737
Oh.

639
00:46:29,824 --> 00:46:33,656
Can I come in, Mr Devine?
It's rather personal. I'm Jim Kelly.

640
00:46:33,745 --> 00:46:37,409
- You called my office in Dublin this morning.
- Oh, I see.

641
00:46:42,461 --> 00:46:46,708
Why don't you invite us in, Ned,
so the man can tell you his business?

642
00:46:49,092 --> 00:46:51,168
Yes, right.

643
00:46:51,261 --> 00:46:53,300
I- I-In you come.

644
00:46:53,388 --> 00:46:55,925
I think it's best if we're left alone now.

645
00:46:56,015 --> 00:46:58,091
- Thanks again.
- Right you are.

646
00:46:58,184 --> 00:47:00,260
- Watch your head.
- All right.

647
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:03,596
All the best, then. All the best!

648
00:47:17,535 --> 00:47:20,904
Would it be better if I was dressed, Mr Kelly?

649
00:47:20,997 --> 00:47:23,404
It would indeed, Ned. You take your time.

650
00:47:23,499 --> 00:47:25,159
Right.

651
00:47:31,089 --> 00:47:33,794
Do you have any family living nearby, Ned?

652
00:47:33,883 --> 00:47:34,963
Oh, no,...

653
00:47:35,051 --> 00:47:37,127
.. I'm all on my own now.

654
00:47:39,889 --> 00:47:43,139
Do you have much family yourself, Mr Kelly?

655
00:47:43,225 --> 00:47:46,890
Oh, I do.
Too much at times, if you know what I mean.

656
00:47:46,979 --> 00:47:51,557
We've got three kids now, so there's always
aunties, uncles and cousins coming over...

657
00:47:51,650 --> 00:47:53,726
.. wanting to visit.

658
00:48:03,703 --> 00:48:06,656
- Were you a fisherman by any chance, Ned?
- Oh, yes.

659
00:48:06,747 --> 00:48:08,823
I was at sea, man and boy.

660
00:48:08,916 --> 00:48:12,996
This was my father's cottage originally.
He used to run a boat...

661
00:48:13,086 --> 00:48:15,292
.. from here.

662
00:48:19,133 --> 00:48:21,256
What do you think?

663
00:48:21,344 --> 00:48:24,131
You can't wear that!

664
00:48:24,221 --> 00:48:29,298
You have to be careful. Winning the lotto
can bring as much bad luck as it can good.

665
00:48:29,393 --> 00:48:31,469
It's a shame you have no family.

666
00:48:31,562 --> 00:48:34,099
Oh, you're doing grand. Grand.

667
00:48:34,189 --> 00:48:37,688
Don't be worrying now.
You'll have the lotto man...

668
00:48:37,776 --> 00:48:40,183
.. twisted round your little finger.

669
00:48:40,278 --> 00:48:43,729
- Oh! Holy Mother of God!
- What?

670
00:48:43,823 --> 00:48:46,907
You'll have to be careful
of your friends after the win.

671
00:48:46,992 --> 00:48:51,950
The winning ticket is in my little bag.
My little bag has been left in the phone box.

672
00:48:52,039 --> 00:48:53,663
Oh, great.

673
00:48:54,708 --> 00:48:56,368
Bloody great.

674
00:48:57,294 --> 00:49:01,338
Do you understand what I'm saying?
You'll have to watch your friends.

675
00:49:01,422 --> 00:49:04,542
Ah, there we are, Ned. Ready for business.

676
00:49:07,345 --> 00:49:09,503
Will you have a whiskey, Mr Kelly?

677
00:49:09,597 --> 00:49:12,301
I won't, thank you, but you help yourself.

678
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:22,516
Well, Ned, the reason I'm here...

679
00:49:22,609 --> 00:49:28,444
.. is that sometimes when people learn just
how much they have won, they get a shock.

680
00:49:32,576 --> 00:49:34,652
Oh, yes. Oh, that I can imagine.

681
00:49:34,745 --> 00:49:35,943
Right. So,...

682
00:49:36,038 --> 00:49:39,656
.. I expect now you'll want to know
just how much you have won.

683
00:49:39,749 --> 00:49:43,414
Oh, and you'd be in a position
to tell me that, would you, Jim?

684
00:49:43,503 --> 00:49:46,669
I can tell you exactly how much.
Do you have your ticket?

685
00:49:46,756 --> 00:49:49,163
Will you excuse me just a minute, Jim?

686
00:49:49,258 --> 00:49:51,796
I have a bit of an upset tummy coming on.

687
00:49:52,887 --> 00:49:54,546
OK.

688
00:50:25,875 --> 00:50:28,793
Are you all right there?

689
00:50:28,878 --> 00:50:31,583
Oh, yes. I'm sorry about that.

690
00:50:31,672 --> 00:50:34,163
- It must be the excitement.
- Of course.

691
00:50:34,258 --> 00:50:35,633
Where were we?

692
00:50:38,721 --> 00:50:40,796
Oh, yes, the ticket.

693
00:50:41,974 --> 00:50:45,425
There he is. There's the winner.

694
00:50:48,021 --> 00:50:52,398
What a famous little chap he is.

695
00:50:52,483 --> 00:50:54,606
Big win, is it?

696
00:50:56,237 --> 00:50:57,945
Ned,...

697
00:50:58,030 --> 00:51:02,407
.. you've won... six million,
eight hundred and ninety-four thousand,...

698
00:51:02,492 --> 00:51:05,279
.. six hundred and twenty pounds!

699
00:51:07,831 --> 00:51:09,574
How do you feel?

700
00:51:09,666 --> 00:51:10,994
Oh...

701
00:51:11,084 --> 00:51:12,661
Er...

702
00:51:12,752 --> 00:51:14,958
Take your time now, there's no rush.

703
00:51:17,715 --> 00:51:22,258
It's a great shock to the system. Just give
yourself a moment to get used to the idea.

704
00:51:22,344 --> 00:51:24,420
Oh...

705
00:51:25,180 --> 00:51:26,888
So, what do you think, Ned?

706
00:51:26,973 --> 00:51:29,547
- Ah...
- Well, it was a rollover week.

707
00:51:29,643 --> 00:51:34,470
The jackpot wasn't won last week, so they
carried it over, and you're the only winner.

708
00:51:34,564 --> 00:51:36,640
Were you aware of that?

709
00:51:36,732 --> 00:51:38,392
I...

710
00:51:39,443 --> 00:51:40,522
No.

711
00:51:40,611 --> 00:51:43,565
OK. Look, naturally enough,
with a claim this size,...

712
00:51:43,655 --> 00:51:47,949
.. there's a lot of forms to be filled out,
and we can do that today if you like.

713
00:51:48,034 --> 00:51:51,284
But I can go and come back
another day if you'd prefer.

714
00:51:51,371 --> 00:51:53,826
No, no, no, no,...

715
00:51:53,915 --> 00:51:56,619
.. fill them in now, Jim.

716
00:51:56,709 --> 00:51:58,785
Right. Well, let's have a look.

717
00:52:07,469 --> 00:52:09,011
Oh! Hello!

718
00:52:09,763 --> 00:52:11,839
What sort of a game is this?

719
00:52:11,932 --> 00:52:15,383
- Shush, will you? Shush, shush!
- Don't you shush me!

720
00:52:15,476 --> 00:52:20,103
Michael's in there
with the man from the lotto.

721
00:52:20,189 --> 00:52:23,225
Can I have your full name
and date of birth, please, Ned?

722
00:52:27,112 --> 00:52:29,188
Ned Patrick Devine,...

723
00:52:29,781 --> 00:52:31,441
.. born...

724
00:52:31,533 --> 00:52:35,400
.. seventeenth of July, 1931.

725
00:52:36,371 --> 00:52:38,826
Six pounds, two ounces.

726
00:52:40,708 --> 00:52:42,784
OK. Now I'll need to find...

727
00:52:42,877 --> 00:52:45,165
.. your social insurance number.

728
00:52:45,254 --> 00:52:47,792
I know it off by heart, Jim.

729
00:52:47,881 --> 00:52:49,126
It's...

730
00:52:49,216 --> 00:52:50,924
.. eight, six,...

731
00:52:51,009 --> 00:52:52,918
.. four, three,...

732
00:52:53,011 --> 00:52:54,719
.. six, seven,...

733
00:52:54,804 --> 00:52:56,713
.. four, B.

734
00:52:56,806 --> 00:52:59,842
That's wonderful, Ned!

735
00:53:03,521 --> 00:53:08,396
You let Michael go in there on his own?
Jackie, he's never told a lie in his life.

736
00:53:08,484 --> 00:53:11,153
Well, he's making up for it now, so.

737
00:53:14,739 --> 00:53:18,488
Right, Ned. It shouldn't be long
before I can issue the cheque.

738
00:53:18,576 --> 00:53:23,915
Don't take too long now, Jim.
I'll be losing interest on that money!

739
00:53:23,998 --> 00:53:28,706
Right, I'd best get back to Dublin.
There's a lot of paperwork to be sorted out.

740
00:53:28,794 --> 00:53:31,367
- Mind your head.
- I will, thanks.

741
00:53:32,005 --> 00:53:34,543
You did write your name
on the back of the ticket?

742
00:53:34,633 --> 00:53:37,468
- Oh, I did indeed.
- Very sensible of you.

743
00:53:37,552 --> 00:53:39,960
- Means no-one else can claim it.
- Right!

744
00:53:40,054 --> 00:53:45,973
Only thing is, it means it'll take a bit longer.
I have to come back to make some enquiries.

745
00:53:46,060 --> 00:53:48,385
To make sure that you are Ned Devine.

746
00:53:50,231 --> 00:53:52,602
Oh, well, congratulations, Ned.

747
00:53:52,691 --> 00:53:54,767
Take care now.

748
00:54:06,913 --> 00:54:10,530
- Are we rich, man?
- Or are you off to prison?

749
00:54:10,624 --> 00:54:13,578
We're not rich,
and I'm off to prison soon enough.

750
00:54:13,669 --> 00:54:16,669
But I saw his face when he left.
He thinks you're Ned.

751
00:54:16,755 --> 00:54:21,417
He believes it now, but he's coming back
in a few days to ask questions in the village.

752
00:54:21,509 --> 00:54:24,380
- But all that laughing!
- Jackie,...

753
00:54:24,470 --> 00:54:27,341
.. the winnings is almost seven million.

754
00:54:27,431 --> 00:54:32,638
God in heaven! And this is how Ned
must have felt coming so close to a fortune.

755
00:54:32,728 --> 00:54:35,433
At least we've not woken up dead in heaven!

756
00:54:35,522 --> 00:54:36,553
No.

757
00:54:36,648 --> 00:54:39,353
You're alive, with prison to go to.

758
00:54:54,707 --> 00:54:57,114
If I'd have known how much was won,...

759
00:54:58,126 --> 00:55:01,542
.. I'd never have started in the first place.

760
00:55:01,630 --> 00:55:04,251
Oh, Lord, this is getting awful serious.

761
00:55:05,258 --> 00:55:07,334
It's desperate.

762
00:55:08,136 --> 00:55:10,212
Oh, God, you did well today, man.

763
00:55:10,847 --> 00:55:13,172
Me and the whiskey.

764
00:55:13,265 --> 00:55:15,341
But Annie is still livid.

765
00:55:15,434 --> 00:55:17,510
Ah, she'll come round.

766
00:55:19,229 --> 00:55:21,305
What a performance that was!

767
00:55:22,566 --> 00:55:25,401
Your Jessy would have been proud of you.

768
00:55:25,485 --> 00:55:28,106
That she would. God bless her.

769
00:55:28,196 --> 00:55:30,272
I'd swear she was there today.

770
00:55:32,116 --> 00:55:34,821
But Jessy or not, I can't keep it up.

771
00:55:36,412 --> 00:55:38,488
Are we off to prison?

772
00:55:38,580 --> 00:55:41,285
Ned doesn't want us in prison,...

773
00:55:42,834 --> 00:55:47,579
.. but I can't believe
he wants us to be multimillionaires either.

774
00:55:47,672 --> 00:55:50,163
Was any of this in the dream?

775
00:55:50,842 --> 00:55:52,502
No, no.

776
00:55:53,219 --> 00:55:56,173
No, this is for you and me
to work out, Michael.

777
00:56:01,685 --> 00:56:03,761
- Good night to you.
- Good night.

778
00:56:07,107 --> 00:56:08,767
Finn?

779
00:56:17,366 --> 00:56:19,442
Finn, are you there?

780
00:56:22,621 --> 00:56:24,697
Of course I'm here.

781
00:56:24,790 --> 00:56:28,123
- I'm always here.
- I thought I'd come up and see you.

782
00:56:30,754 --> 00:56:32,829
I thought I'd come up and see you.

783
00:56:32,922 --> 00:56:34,998
- Right.
- Are you all right?

784
00:56:35,842 --> 00:56:37,501
Great.

785
00:56:42,306 --> 00:56:44,382
Are you sure?

786
00:56:44,850 --> 00:56:46,510
Go on.

787
00:56:48,687 --> 00:56:50,763
Full of the joys, boys.

788
00:56:50,855 --> 00:56:52,931
What have you been doing?

789
00:56:53,024 --> 00:56:55,100
I've been thinking.

790
00:56:56,235 --> 00:56:58,311
What have you been thinking?

791
00:56:58,404 --> 00:57:00,480
Oh, I've had a few thoughts.

792
00:57:02,366 --> 00:57:06,316
I thought about punching Pat Mulligan
in the face last night.

793
00:57:06,411 --> 00:57:10,160
I thought about telling Maurice
I was the real father. And I thought...

794
00:57:10,248 --> 00:57:14,826
- .. strawberry soap'd make all the difference.
- Finn, I love you. You know that, don't you?

795
00:57:14,919 --> 00:57:18,169
If it weren't for the pigs,
I'd marry you tomorrow.

796
00:57:21,467 --> 00:57:23,543
It's all been said before.

797
00:57:28,098 --> 00:57:30,885
Anyway, I quite like working with the pigs!

798
00:57:32,936 --> 00:57:36,768
I get very attached to them.
Despite the smell.

799
00:57:44,113 --> 00:57:46,438
He's promising to look after me.

800
00:57:48,367 --> 00:57:50,858
Me and... Maurice.

801
00:57:55,540 --> 00:57:59,123
Do you mean look after,
or do you mean pay for?

802
00:57:59,210 --> 00:58:00,752
What?

803
00:58:00,837 --> 00:58:04,620
Maurice belongs with his real father!

804
00:58:04,715 --> 00:58:08,298
Or is Pat Mulligan the father?
Is that what all this is about?

805
00:58:08,385 --> 00:58:11,090
- No. I'm sorry, Finn.
- Well, will you tell me?!

806
00:58:12,431 --> 00:58:14,304
I have to go.

807
00:58:16,309 --> 00:58:18,978
Is he mine, Maggie?

808
00:58:32,741 --> 00:58:34,817
You're a country boy, Jackie.

809
00:58:34,910 --> 00:58:37,614
Do you think you can outsmart
the man from the city?

810
00:58:37,704 --> 00:58:40,195
I know what Ned wants, Annie.

811
00:58:41,457 --> 00:58:44,791
- I'm sure of it now.
- Jackie, Ned is dead.

812
00:58:44,877 --> 00:58:47,748
The game's moved beyond
talk of dreams and spirits.

813
00:58:47,838 --> 00:58:51,005
A crime has been committed. It's a fraud.

814
00:58:51,091 --> 00:58:55,005
I don't want you... worrying about me.

815
00:58:55,095 --> 00:58:57,800
I'm not worried about you, Jackie.

816
00:58:57,889 --> 00:59:00,925
You'll manage.
I think I could probably manage.

817
00:59:01,017 --> 00:59:05,061
But if anything happens to Michael,
then God help you, Jackie.

818
00:59:05,646 --> 00:59:08,316
For he will suffer.

819
00:59:10,359 --> 00:59:12,601
How much am I worth to you, Jackie?

820
00:59:12,695 --> 00:59:14,983
Oh, Annie...

821
00:59:15,072 --> 00:59:18,606
How much?
How much for Michael? For the farm?

822
00:59:18,700 --> 00:59:21,985
For God's sake,
what are you going to do with...

823
00:59:22,078 --> 00:59:24,569
.. seven million pounds?

824
00:59:25,581 --> 00:59:27,657
- I know...
- No.

825
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:30,619
Stop.

826
00:59:34,048 --> 00:59:36,123
You're on your own from now on.

827
01:00:00,739 --> 01:00:04,238
I'm not a great man
for telling things the way they are.

828
01:00:04,326 --> 01:00:08,655
I've been known to add a little colour
to stories for the benefit of those...

829
01:00:08,746 --> 01:00:11,747
.. that'll listen. Yet here tonight,...

830
01:00:11,832 --> 01:00:14,537
.. I can swear that all I've told you...

831
01:00:14,627 --> 01:00:16,703
.. is true.

832
01:00:16,795 --> 01:00:21,457
The money will be claimed and divided
equally between the fifty-two of us.

833
01:00:21,550 --> 01:00:25,298
Now, I was wrong to think
I could claim the money myself.

834
01:00:26,012 --> 01:00:28,088
That's not what Ned wants.

835
01:00:28,681 --> 01:00:31,350
He wants us to share the winnings.

836
01:00:31,434 --> 01:00:33,510
A nest egg for us all.

837
01:00:35,021 --> 01:00:38,223
So now if the lotto man
comes to the village,...

838
01:00:38,315 --> 01:00:41,898
.. you say that Ned Devine is alive and well,...

839
01:00:41,985 --> 01:00:44,061
.. and you point your finger...

840
01:00:44,154 --> 01:00:46,230
.. to Michael O'Sullivan.

841
01:00:47,699 --> 01:00:49,987
- Jackie?
- Yes, darling?

842
01:00:50,076 --> 01:00:53,160
How will we recognise
the lotto man when he comes?

843
01:00:53,246 --> 01:00:54,989
He sneezes.

844
01:00:55,081 --> 01:00:58,414
- He sneezes?
- Sneezes. He gets hay fever...

845
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:00,374
.. when he's in the country.

846
01:01:02,045 --> 01:01:04,832
Enough of the sneezing.
How much has been won?

847
01:01:05,507 --> 01:01:07,583
Yes, yes, in a minute.

848
01:01:07,676 --> 01:01:09,752
Now,...

849
01:01:09,844 --> 01:01:12,631
.. everyone in favour of claiming the money...

850
01:01:12,722 --> 01:01:15,758
.. should visit me before sunset tomorrow.

851
01:01:15,850 --> 01:01:18,767
If we're not all committed,...

852
01:01:19,270 --> 01:01:21,760
.. there'll be no claim.

853
01:01:22,564 --> 01:01:26,147
I'll make my way to Dublin
to face the authorities alone.

854
01:01:26,234 --> 01:01:28,310
How much has been won?

855
01:01:32,615 --> 01:01:34,359
And so...

856
01:01:34,450 --> 01:01:37,570
.. we move on to the claim itself.

857
01:01:37,662 --> 01:01:42,904
The total amount of the jackpot,
the total which will be...

858
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:47,708
.. claimed and divided
into shares of fifty-two,...

859
01:01:51,633 --> 01:01:54,005
.. is six million,...

860
01:01:54,093 --> 01:01:57,213
.. eight hundred and ninety-four thousand,...

861
01:01:57,305 --> 01:01:59,463
.. six hundred and twenty pounds!

862
01:02:16,364 --> 01:02:18,440
What changed your mind?

863
01:02:20,785 --> 01:02:22,861
You're no good to me in prison.

864
01:02:24,455 --> 01:02:27,242
A hundred and thirty thousand pounds each!

865
01:02:28,333 --> 01:02:33,209
If they come, they'll be coming for the money,
not for the spirit of Ned Devine.

866
01:02:33,296 --> 01:02:37,922
If it's claimed and spent at all,
he'll rest in peace.

867
01:02:38,009 --> 01:02:39,669
If you go to prison,...

868
01:02:39,761 --> 01:02:42,631
.. this'll be our last night together for...

869
01:02:43,597 --> 01:02:45,389
.. ten years.

870
01:02:45,474 --> 01:02:48,641
Then let's not waste it in sleeping.

871
01:02:53,273 --> 01:02:55,016
# If I had money

872
01:02:55,108 --> 01:02:57,860
# Enough to spend

873
01:02:57,944 --> 01:03:02,107
# And leisure time to sit a while

874
01:03:02,823 --> 01:03:07,035
# There is a fair maid in this town

875
01:03:07,119 --> 01:03:10,867
# That surely has my heart beguiled

876
01:03:11,915 --> 01:03:15,663
# Her rosy cheeks and ruby lips

877
01:03:16,086 --> 01:03:20,035
# I own she has me heart enthralled

878
01:03:32,142 --> 01:03:34,680
Will you bring us up a cup oftea?

879
01:03:49,533 --> 01:03:52,024
Annie, is there any milk?

880
01:03:52,911 --> 01:03:55,236
You'll have to go to the post office!

881
01:04:04,631 --> 01:04:06,290
Oh, Lord!

882
01:04:13,681 --> 01:04:15,969
- Morning!
- How are you doing?

883
01:04:26,317 --> 01:04:29,402
Right.

884
01:04:34,700 --> 01:04:37,903
Good luck.

885
01:04:42,749 --> 01:04:45,121
- Hello.
- Hello, Kitty.

886
01:04:45,210 --> 01:04:47,535
Now, Kitty, do you remember who I am?

887
01:04:47,628 --> 01:04:49,004
I do.

888
01:04:49,088 --> 01:04:51,840
I do, Michael. You're Ned Devine.

889
01:04:52,883 --> 01:04:56,003
Good girl yourself. Give her a drink, Annie.

890
01:04:56,095 --> 01:04:57,754
Thank you.

891
01:05:02,642 --> 01:05:03,757
Now,...

892
01:05:03,852 --> 01:05:06,722
.. I'll sign... on one condition.

893
01:05:06,813 --> 01:05:09,849
Well, we'd not really counted on conditions.

894
01:05:09,941 --> 01:05:13,985
- Oh, it's only a very small one, Jackie.
- Go on.

895
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:22,358
Of course you can. No problem at all.

896
01:05:22,452 --> 01:05:24,528
Oh, thank you, Jackie!

897
01:05:25,664 --> 01:05:27,989
There we are. Number thirty-eight.

898
01:05:29,667 --> 01:05:32,917
- We're nearing the finishing line.
- Well done, Kitty.

899
01:05:33,004 --> 01:05:35,376
Thank you, Michael.

900
01:05:35,464 --> 01:05:37,872
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

901
01:05:37,967 --> 01:05:40,671
Was it a big condition, Jackie?

902
01:05:40,761 --> 01:05:44,094
Not at all.
You're having dinner with her next week.

903
01:05:45,557 --> 01:05:47,633
Hey, hey! Hey!

904
01:05:48,977 --> 01:05:51,598
Dennis, you've jumped the queue. What is it?

905
01:05:51,688 --> 01:05:53,763
Jackie, it won't work.

906
01:05:53,856 --> 01:05:55,054
What?

907
01:05:55,149 --> 01:05:59,894
We're claiming a cheque that can't be cashed.
Ned doesn't have a bank account.

908
01:05:59,987 --> 01:06:02,774
- What?
- I used to work at the bank.

909
01:06:02,865 --> 01:06:05,699
It's not easy cashing such a mighty cheque.

910
01:06:05,784 --> 01:06:09,283
Mrs Kennedy can't cash
seven million at the post office!

911
01:06:16,419 --> 01:06:18,956
We open a cheque account, in advance,...

912
01:06:19,046 --> 01:06:21,122
.. offshore, maybe Jersey,...

913
01:06:21,215 --> 01:06:24,714
.. and deposit 50.
It's a joint account in the name of...

914
01:06:24,801 --> 01:06:28,170
- Slow.
- .. Ned Devine and Jackie O'Shea.

915
01:06:28,263 --> 01:06:32,047
- I'll pretend to be Ned and you'll be yourself.
- Slowly, slowly.

916
01:06:32,142 --> 01:06:34,811
Now, the account's open a week,...

917
01:06:34,894 --> 01:06:36,970
.. Jackie puts Ned's cheque in.

918
01:06:37,647 --> 01:06:42,688
He then uses his own signature on the
joint account to share out the winnings.

919
01:06:44,945 --> 01:06:47,021
It's legal?

920
01:06:47,572 --> 01:06:50,063
It's as close as you'd want to get, boy.

921
01:07:00,293 --> 01:07:02,830
- Do you understand it?
- Not a word.

922
01:07:13,430 --> 01:07:16,881
- Sit just there and keep looking at the water.
- Where?

923
01:07:16,975 --> 01:07:20,224
- Just there.
- What am I supposed to be looking for?

924
01:07:20,311 --> 01:07:22,054
Just sit there,...

925
01:07:22,146 --> 01:07:24,222
.. and keep quiet.

926
01:07:34,157 --> 01:07:39,531
Do you think Father Mulligan will approve of
all this lotto business when he gets back?

927
01:07:39,620 --> 01:07:43,867
If you can fill the collection box and
mend the church roof, he'll be over the moon.

928
01:07:43,958 --> 01:07:46,034
- Do you think so?
- I do.

929
01:07:48,087 --> 01:07:50,328
And what about Tullymore?

930
01:07:50,422 --> 01:07:54,633
What happens if everyone decides to...
Well, to move away and...

931
01:07:54,718 --> 01:07:57,837
.. set up somewhere more glamorous
with their winnings.

932
01:07:57,929 --> 01:08:00,965
Nah. The winnings
will be spent at Fitzgerald's.

933
01:08:01,057 --> 01:08:03,299
A hundred thousand in the pub?

934
01:08:04,685 --> 01:08:06,014
Jesus!

935
01:08:08,981 --> 01:08:11,602
It's probably been spent already.

936
01:08:11,692 --> 01:08:15,772
Vodka tonic, gin and tonic, Bailey's.
Where's Tom's Babycham?

937
01:08:15,862 --> 01:08:20,440
All right! All right! I'm coming now!
Would you give me a chance!

938
01:08:20,533 --> 01:08:22,526
I've only got one pair of hands!

939
01:08:22,618 --> 01:08:26,118
Just a minute.
Hold on, hold on. Who's paying for this?

940
01:08:30,501 --> 01:08:32,577
Who's paying for this lot now?

941
01:08:34,212 --> 01:08:35,872
I will!

942
01:08:39,926 --> 01:08:42,796
I never thought I'd see the day!

943
01:08:43,137 --> 01:08:45,545
We should give her the day.

944
01:08:45,640 --> 01:08:48,724
The sun's almost set.

945
01:08:48,809 --> 01:08:50,885
I'm calling.

946
01:08:54,773 --> 01:08:57,015
Are we done?

947
01:08:57,109 --> 01:08:59,813
Michael, is your phone working?

948
01:08:59,903 --> 01:09:02,939
Oh, God, no, they're all down,
since the storm.

949
01:09:04,282 --> 01:09:08,362
- We're missing one.
- But the village is already celebrating.

950
01:09:09,578 --> 01:09:11,820
It's Lizzy Quinn.

951
01:09:12,539 --> 01:09:14,615
Lizzy Quinn, the witch.

952
01:09:15,459 --> 01:09:18,329
God, if the village finds out, she'll burn.

953
01:09:28,429 --> 01:09:30,671
That's far enough.

954
01:09:30,765 --> 01:09:32,841
We don't want to frighten her.

955
01:09:33,851 --> 01:09:35,927
Right, what have we got?

956
01:09:36,019 --> 01:09:39,637
Well, I've her toaster here.
It's all mended and tested.

957
01:09:39,731 --> 01:09:42,222
- Good man.
- And I've got some cat food.

958
01:09:43,109 --> 01:09:46,525
Grand. And I've got something for her myself.

959
01:09:47,697 --> 01:09:50,270
- Will I make you a nice cup of tea, Lizzy?
- No!

960
01:09:50,366 --> 01:09:52,442
Should Jackie get the fire going?

961
01:09:52,535 --> 01:09:54,159
I'm not cold.

962
01:09:54,245 --> 01:09:59,749
I brought you a little treat, Lizzy, to have
with your tea. Some nice coconut creams.

963
01:09:59,833 --> 01:10:03,617
No, thank you.
So you came to get my name on your paper?

964
01:10:03,712 --> 01:10:08,420
Yours is the only one missing, Lizzy.
The whole village is waiting for the news.

965
01:10:08,508 --> 01:10:10,584
Give me your list.

966
01:10:15,473 --> 01:10:18,888
- And I'm the only one missing, you say?
- You are.

967
01:10:18,976 --> 01:10:21,763
Lizzy, t'would be good for the village.

968
01:10:22,813 --> 01:10:27,558
Did you know that if you report a fraud to the
lotto, you'll get ten per cent of the winnings?

969
01:10:27,650 --> 01:10:30,058
Have you spoken to the lotto?

970
01:10:30,153 --> 01:10:33,521
I'm not stupid enough
to be bought by your coconut creams.

971
01:10:33,614 --> 01:10:39,486
And I'm not stupid enough to call the lotto.
But ten per cent is 670,000.

972
01:10:39,578 --> 01:10:41,405
Oh, Lizzy!

973
01:10:41,497 --> 01:10:46,039
How could you bear to live in the village
if you did a thing like that?

974
01:10:46,126 --> 01:10:48,414
The whole lot of us'll be in prison.

975
01:10:48,503 --> 01:10:53,212
Well, there's your answer.
There'd be no-one here to be bothered by.

976
01:10:53,299 --> 01:10:56,834
You see,
I'm after more than a nest egg, Jackie.

977
01:10:56,927 --> 01:11:01,340
As I'm the only one that hasn't signed,
I figure there's some bargaining to be done.

978
01:11:04,768 --> 01:11:07,685
You're a right witch, aren't you, Lizzy?

979
01:11:07,771 --> 01:11:09,929
This is my offer.

980
01:11:21,575 --> 01:11:25,240
And in death be there some peace.

981
01:11:25,329 --> 01:11:28,365
An angel will cry with choir and sing...

982
01:11:28,999 --> 01:11:32,165
.. to lift out the spirit that purity brings.

983
01:11:32,252 --> 01:11:34,328
- Amen.
- Amen.

984
01:11:35,463 --> 01:11:37,539
So she'll sign for a million?

985
01:11:37,632 --> 01:11:41,296
A million! She'll sign for
the same as us or get nothing at all.

986
01:11:41,385 --> 01:11:44,006
- What if she calls the lotto?
- Will we call it off?

987
01:11:44,096 --> 01:11:47,963
Oh, don't mind her, boys.
She's trying it on. Don't mind her.

988
01:14:20,115 --> 01:14:22,191
Please be seated.

989
01:14:24,661 --> 01:14:29,821
We are gathered here today
to celebrate the life of Ned Devine.

990
01:14:33,961 --> 01:14:35,752
Ned Devine...

991
01:14:35,838 --> 01:14:37,914
.. meant something to you all.

992
01:14:38,799 --> 01:14:40,875
And there,...

993
01:14:40,967 --> 01:14:42,711
.. in his passing,...

994
01:14:42,802 --> 01:14:46,930
.. he has made sure that
he has left a little something...

995
01:14:47,015 --> 01:14:49,766
.. for you all.

996
01:14:49,851 --> 01:14:51,510
Hello?

997
01:14:52,186 --> 01:14:55,103
When we think of Ned's life,...

998
01:14:55,898 --> 01:15:01,236
.. when we think of the manner
in which he was taken from us,...

999
01:15:01,320 --> 01:15:05,364
.. we may find ourselves thinking
that he was taken unfairly.

1000
01:15:20,629 --> 01:15:24,578
# Lux eterna

1001
01:15:24,674 --> 01:15:31,092
# Luceat eis, Domine

1002
01:15:41,148 --> 01:15:43,140
# Et lux perpetua

1003
01:15:43,233 --> 01:15:49,353
# Luceat eis

1004
01:16:03,293 --> 01:16:06,662
As we look back on the life of...

1005
01:16:21,810 --> 01:16:24,930
As we look back on the life of...

1006
01:16:28,650 --> 01:16:30,310
Atchoo!

1007
01:16:48,293 --> 01:16:50,369
Who is he?

1008
01:17:17,779 --> 01:17:19,855
Michael O'Sullivan...

1009
01:17:19,947 --> 01:17:22,236
.. was my great friend.

1010
01:17:30,999 --> 01:17:33,870
But I don't ever remember telling him that.

1011
01:17:36,171 --> 01:17:39,255
The words that are spoken at a funeral...

1012
01:17:39,340 --> 01:17:42,294
.. are spoken too late for the man that is dead.

1013
01:17:44,929 --> 01:17:49,056
What a wonderful thing it would be
to visit your own funeral.

1014
01:17:50,434 --> 01:17:52,510
To sit at the front...

1015
01:17:52,602 --> 01:17:54,678
.. and hear what was said.

1016
01:17:55,939 --> 01:17:58,181
Maybe to say a few things yourself.

1017
01:17:59,108 --> 01:18:01,184
Michael and I...

1018
01:18:01,277 --> 01:18:03,353
.. grew old together.

1019
01:18:04,822 --> 01:18:06,898
But at times,...

1020
01:18:07,783 --> 01:18:11,531
.. when we laughed, we grew younger.

1021
01:18:18,668 --> 01:18:20,744
If he was here now,...

1022
01:18:21,337 --> 01:18:23,413
.. if he could hear what I say,...

1023
01:18:24,382 --> 01:18:27,133
.. I'd congratulate him on being...

1024
01:18:27,218 --> 01:18:29,294
.. a great man.

1025
01:18:30,095 --> 01:18:32,337
And thank him for being a friend.

1026
01:18:44,942 --> 01:18:47,018
Oh, for God's sake!

1027
01:19:02,667 --> 01:19:05,502
He must have been a great man,
this Michael fellow.

1028
01:19:05,586 --> 01:19:07,662
He had his faults.

1029
01:19:09,048 --> 01:19:11,254
Hello there, Ned. Are you well?

1030
01:19:11,342 --> 01:19:13,418
Not bad, Jim. Not bad.

1031
01:19:13,510 --> 01:19:16,926
Jackie. I'm sorry about
interrupting like that earlier.

1032
01:19:17,014 --> 01:19:19,801
Jackie knows about
our little bit of business.

1033
01:19:19,891 --> 01:19:22,678
Good. I'm glad you have
a friend you can confide in.

1034
01:19:22,769 --> 01:19:25,853
And will you be making
your enquiries today?

1035
01:19:25,939 --> 01:19:29,556
Oh, no. The village says that you're Ned,
so that's good enough for me.

1036
01:19:29,650 --> 01:19:34,526
I can issue you with the cheque today.
Although, are you sure this is a good time?

1037
01:19:34,613 --> 01:19:37,104
It is, Jim. As good as any.

1038
01:19:37,699 --> 01:19:39,158
All right.

1039
01:19:39,242 --> 01:19:41,947
- You wouldn't like a drink, Jim?
- No.

1040
01:19:42,037 --> 01:19:44,574
- No.
- I'd best leave you alone now, Ned.

1041
01:19:50,128 --> 01:19:52,203
Tighten up your strings, boys.

1042
01:19:53,422 --> 01:19:55,498
Oh, that's great, Jim.

1043
01:19:55,591 --> 01:19:58,129
- Mind your head there now.
- Will do now.

1044
01:19:58,218 --> 01:20:01,053
The best of luck, Ned.
Call me if you need any advice.

1045
01:20:01,138 --> 01:20:03,510
- Right.
- Watch out for your friends.

1046
01:20:03,598 --> 01:20:06,967
- Don't spend all your money in one go.
- No, I wouldn't do that.

1047
01:20:07,060 --> 01:20:09,977
- Jackie, good luck to you.
- Ah, good luck, man.

1048
01:20:10,063 --> 01:20:12,684
- Look after himself now.
- I will, I will.

1049
01:20:12,773 --> 01:20:14,849
- Best of luck!
- Thanks, Jim.

1050
01:20:53,102 --> 01:20:55,510
Finn... you're stinking!

1051
01:20:55,605 --> 01:20:58,356
- Oh, sorry, Maggs.
- Stinking rich!

1052
01:20:59,358 --> 01:21:01,600
No more pigs.

1053
01:21:01,694 --> 01:21:03,769
No more pigs, Maggie!

1054
01:21:08,825 --> 01:21:10,901
Ah, come for a ball, girl!

1055
01:21:11,870 --> 01:21:13,909
You've beautiful calves.

1056
01:21:14,122 --> 01:21:16,791
- Any news from the witch?
- No, Brendy.

1057
01:21:16,874 --> 01:21:20,457
- I heard the last from her.
- What if she calls the lotto?

1058
01:21:20,544 --> 01:21:22,620
She won't call.

1059
01:21:23,047 --> 01:21:27,258
Anyway, the phones are down.
What's she gonna do? Walk to Dublin?

1060
01:21:42,231 --> 01:21:44,307
I'm watching you, fella.

1061
01:21:56,369 --> 01:21:58,445
Go on, boys!

1062
01:22:14,719 --> 01:22:16,795
Bitch! Bitch!

1063
01:23:05,308 --> 01:23:07,596
Come on, boys!

1064
01:23:18,361 --> 01:23:19,108
Hello?

1065
01:23:19,904 --> 01:23:20,651
Atchoo!

1066
01:24:31,721 --> 01:24:33,131
What?

1067
01:24:33,222 --> 01:24:35,049
Unbelievable!

1068
01:24:36,266 --> 01:24:38,306
Get your hands off those!

1069
01:24:38,393 --> 01:24:39,971
- Hello.
- How are you?

1070
01:24:40,062 --> 01:24:43,228
All right, darling.
I was just looking at your man.

1071
01:24:43,315 --> 01:24:45,390
Al Capone!

1072
01:24:47,652 --> 01:24:53,108
Jackie, would you say Maurice needed
a father more than seven million pounds?

1073
01:24:53,741 --> 01:24:56,991
I'd say he needed a father
more than fifty million.

1074
01:24:58,746 --> 01:25:01,283
That's what I thought.

1075
01:25:01,373 --> 01:25:06,497
But what are you saying?
How would he be entitled to the money?

1076
01:25:08,463 --> 01:25:10,539
Ned does have a family, Jackie.

1077
01:25:11,174 --> 01:25:12,834
No...

1078
01:25:13,509 --> 01:25:15,585
You'll not tell a soul now.

1079
01:25:17,263 --> 01:25:20,347
- Maurice is the millionaire?
- Yeah!

1080
01:25:20,474 --> 01:25:23,261
He treated me better than any man before.

1081
01:25:24,144 --> 01:25:26,302
You must take it all, Maggie.

1082
01:25:26,396 --> 01:25:29,017
Take it all. Put it away for yourself...

1083
01:25:29,107 --> 01:25:32,641
- .. and the boy.
- No, no. Maurice can do without it.

1084
01:25:32,735 --> 01:25:38,073
Besides, Finn would know he wasn't
the father. I can do without the millions,...

1085
01:25:38,157 --> 01:25:40,399
.. but I can't afford to lose Finn.

1086
01:25:43,954 --> 01:25:46,242
Sure, 130,000 each is plenty.

1087
01:25:49,084 --> 01:25:51,621
- Slinte!
- Slinte!

1088
01:26:08,185 --> 01:26:10,889
Come on, we're almost at the top!

1089
01:26:10,979 --> 01:26:13,386
Sleep it off later like the rest of them.

1090
01:26:25,117 --> 01:26:27,655
- Do we all have a drink?
- Here, Maurice.

1091
01:26:29,037 --> 01:26:31,279
Take a drink...

1092
01:26:31,373 --> 01:26:33,448
.. and remember the man.

1093
01:26:33,541 --> 01:26:36,328
Then raise your spirits to the sky!

1094
01:26:37,753 --> 01:26:39,829
Raise them to Ned Devine!

1095
01:26:42,383 --> 01:26:44,459
God bless you, Ned!

1096
01:26:45,177 --> 01:26:48,047
And may we be forever in your debt.

1097
01:26:49,097 --> 01:26:51,173
To Ned Devine!

1098
01:26:51,266 --> 01:26:52,428
To Ned!

1099
01:26:52,517 --> 01:26:54,177
To Ned.

1100
01:26:55,478 --> 01:26:59,262
# Fill to me the parting glass

1101
01:26:59,357 --> 01:27:04,896
# And drink a health whate'er befalls

1102
01:27:04,987 --> 01:27:09,198
# Then gently rise and softly call

1103
01:27:09,283 --> 01:27:15,118
# Good night and joy be to you all

1104
01:27:15,205 --> 01:27:19,249
# Of all the comrades that e'er I had

1105
01:27:19,334 --> 01:27:23,794
# They're sorry for my going away

1106
01:27:23,879 --> 01:27:28,126
# And all the sweethearts that e'er I had

1107
01:27:28,217 --> 01:27:33,840
# They'd wish me one more day to stay

1108
01:27:33,930 --> 01:27:38,307
# Since it fell into my lot

1109
01:27:38,393 --> 01:27:43,731
# That I should rise and you should not

1110
01:27:43,814 --> 01:27:48,227
# I gently rise and softly call

1111
01:27:48,319 --> 01:27:54,771
# Good night and joy be to you all!

1112
01:28:15,093 --> 01:28:19,304
# But since it fell into my lot

1113
01:28:19,389 --> 01:28:24,893
# That I should rise and you should not

1114
01:28:24,977 --> 01:28:29,354
# I gently rise and softly call

1115
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:34,944
# Good night and joy be to you all

1116
01:28:35,028 --> 01:28:39,357
# So fill to me the parting glass

1117
01:28:39,449 --> 01:28:44,905
# And drink a health whate'er befalls

1118
01:28:44,996 --> 01:28:49,408
# Then gently rise and softly call

1119
01:28:49,500 --> 01:28:58,752
# Good night and joy be to you all!
