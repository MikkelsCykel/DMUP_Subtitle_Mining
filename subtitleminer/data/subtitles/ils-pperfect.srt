the bowl is in the picture

So maybe the less
Nick knows, the better.

643
00:29:36,609 --> 00:29:41,046
Yeah, yeah. I would- I think
I would be of that mind. Mm-hmm.

644
00:29:41,113 --> 00:29:42,273
Good.

645
00:29:42,348 --> 00:29:43,508
- Yeah. Great.
- Great.

646
00:29:43,583 --> 00:29:45,107
- Good.
- Great.

647
00:29:46,986 --> 00:29:48,180
Great.

648
00:29:52,425 --> 00:29:54,359
Have you ever been
to a tennis tournament?.

649
00:29:54,427 --> 00:29:56,327
'Cause I got these two
tickets this weekend.

650
00:29:56,395 --> 00:29:58,363
I mean, purely as a friend thing,
if you wanted to-

651
00:29:58,431 --> 00:30:00,456
Well, that's-

652
00:30:00,533 --> 00:30:02,433
That's very sweet, Sam,

653
00:30:02,501 --> 00:30:05,026
and I would love to,
as a friend thing,

654
00:30:05,104 --> 00:30:07,868
but, uh, you see,
the thing is...

655
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:10,568
Nick's coming
into town this weekend.

656
00:30:10,643 --> 00:30:12,042
Right, right, right.

657
00:30:12,111 --> 00:30:13,442
Right, okay.

658
00:30:13,512 --> 00:30:14,570
Right.

659
00:30:16,248 --> 00:30:17,306
Hey.

660
00:30:17,383 --> 00:30:18,441
Yeah.

661
00:30:18,517 --> 00:30:20,109
Nick's a lucky guy.

662
00:30:20,186 --> 00:30:21,380
You think so?.

663
00:30:21,454 --> 00:30:22,944
I do.

664
00:30:29,395 --> 00:30:30,919
Oh...

665
00:30:30,997 --> 00:30:32,328
God.

666
00:30:48,047 --> 00:30:49,480
Oh! Ma!
Jesus F-ing Christ!

667
00:30:49,548 --> 00:30:50,981
I did not go through
3 hours of labor-

668
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:52,483
not to mention 81/2 years
with your father-

669
00:30:52,551 --> 00:30:53,984
Why do you
do this to me?.

670
00:30:54,053 --> 00:30:55,486
so that I could spend
my days worrying...

671
00:30:55,554 --> 00:30:57,146
Can't I just
put my stuff down?.

672
00:30:57,223 --> 00:30:58,383
whether my daughter was lying in
some ditch somewhere or something worse!

673
00:30:58,457 --> 00:30:59,651
Ditch?!. Mom,
listen to yourself!.

674
00:30:59,725 --> 00:31:01,317
There are no goddamn
ditches in New York!

675
00:31:01,394 --> 00:31:03,521
Don't you raise
your voice to me, young lady!

676
00:31:03,596 --> 00:31:05,962
You want all
the neighbors to hear?.

677
00:31:06,032 --> 00:31:09,195
My neighbors, Mother. This is
my apartment. What are you doing here?.

678
00:31:09,268 --> 00:31:10,929
Let me ask you
a question.

679
00:31:11,003 --> 00:31:12,436
No! You answer
my question!

680
00:31:12,505 --> 00:31:14,439
Do I look stupid
to you?.

681
00:31:14,507 --> 00:31:16,338
Stup-what?. What is that
supposed to mean, Ma?.

682
00:31:16,409 --> 00:31:17,933
"Hi, Mom.
It's me, Kate.

683
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:19,705
I just thought I'd call you
this morning for a change. "

684
00:31:19,779 --> 00:31:21,212
Check your
answering machine.

685
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:24,477
The moment we hung up,
I called you back.

686
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:28,452
You weren't here. 7 times I tried.
7 times, young lady!

687
00:31:28,521 --> 00:31:30,455
So what?.
No TV for a week?.

688
00:31:30,523 --> 00:31:32,286
Then I phoned
the office,

689
00:31:32,358 --> 00:31:33,950
but apparently
Miss Big Shot

690
00:31:34,026 --> 00:31:35,960
was too busy to call
her mother back!

691
00:31:36,028 --> 00:31:38,462
Okay, you know what, though?.
I'm here now, and I'm fine.

692
00:31:38,531 --> 00:31:39,998
Well, I'm not!

693
00:31:40,066 --> 00:31:42,034
And I want to know
where you were this morning!

694
00:31:42,101 --> 00:31:43,193
I have a right
to know!

695
00:31:43,269 --> 00:31:44,759
No, you do not
have a right!

696
00:31:44,837 --> 00:31:45,769
You have no right,
Mother!

697
00:31:45,838 --> 00:31:47,169
I am 28 years old!

698
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:49,571
Don't give me that.
I'm 54. I'm gonna be dead soon!

699
00:31:49,642 --> 00:31:50,802
Oh, God!

700
00:31:50,876 --> 00:31:52,036
Where are you going?.

701
00:31:52,111 --> 00:31:53,476
To kill myself!.

702
00:31:53,546 --> 00:31:54,672
No, no. Not until
you tell me

703
00:31:54,747 --> 00:31:56,977
where you were
this morning. No.

704
00:32:02,488 --> 00:32:05,821
All right, Mom.
I was with a man.

705
00:32:05,891 --> 00:32:09,418
I was with a really
beautiful man...

706
00:32:09,495 --> 00:32:11,986
[ Sniffs]

707
00:32:12,064 --> 00:32:13,998
who,
up until last night,

708
00:32:14,066 --> 00:32:15,533
never even noticed me.

709
00:32:15,601 --> 00:32:19,594
And then all of a sudden
he wanted to be with me,

710
00:32:19,672 --> 00:32:22,573
and I really wanted
to be with him...

711
00:32:22,641 --> 00:32:24,040
so we slept together.

712
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:27,944
We had sex, Mommy,
you know?.

713
00:32:28,013 --> 00:32:29,947
The really dirty kind.

714
00:32:31,951 --> 00:32:34,419
And I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Mommy...

715
00:32:35,654 --> 00:32:38,885
But that's where I was.

716
00:32:38,958 --> 00:32:40,016
[ Sighs ]

717
00:32:40,092 --> 00:32:41,684
Oh, Kate.

718
00:32:43,529 --> 00:32:45,963
Now, that's enough
of that, hmm?.

719
00:32:48,801 --> 00:32:50,962
Tell me the truth now.

720
00:32:52,705 --> 00:32:54,297
Oh, God.

721
00:32:54,373 --> 00:32:55,609
Mmm.

722
00:32:55,742 --> 00:32:57,539
And you know, the thing
that really kills me

723
00:32:57,611 --> 00:33:00,944
is she loved the lie so much better
than she liked the truth.

724
00:33:01,014 --> 00:33:03,175
I mean, even when I had to fudge
a little bit, you know?.

725
00:33:03,249 --> 00:33:04,477
"So, uh,
what does he do?'

726
00:33:04,551 --> 00:33:06,416
"Well, he owns
his own business. "

727
00:33:06,486 --> 00:33:07,953
"Well, can I meet him
this weekend?'

728
00:33:08,021 --> 00:33:10,546
"Nope. We're going
ring shopping in Boston. "

729
00:33:10,624 --> 00:33:11,852
Oh! Ring shopping.

730
00:33:11,925 --> 00:33:12,983
Yeah.

731
00:33:13,059 --> 00:33:14,117
Oh, you're really getting
the hang of this.

732
00:33:14,194 --> 00:33:17,061
I know. Well, it gets
easier once you realize

733
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:19,428
that's what everybody
wants you to do.

734
00:33:19,499 --> 00:33:22,900
Hi. Could I have the number for
Midtown Flowers, please?.

735
00:33:22,969 --> 00:33:24,493
What are you doing?.

736
00:33:24,571 --> 00:33:25,936
Ha ha! Thank you.

737
00:33:26,006 --> 00:33:30,067
Okay. "Press one
to connect this call. "

738
00:33:30,143 --> 00:33:33,635
Yes, hi. I need to send
a huge bouquet

hands off my stems.

I've been waiting years
to use that line.

So, what's
the occasion?.

Oh, come on, Sam.
You're smarter than that.

why a man sends a woman flowers.

I love it when I can
learn something new.

Well, either
they've let you down,

or they're about to.

work this weekend.

in a man.

Now, I'm quiet

780
00:34:57,831 --> 00:35:00,595
Quiet as a mouse could be

781
00:35:00,667 --> 00:35:02,658
But inside my head

782
00:35:02,736 --> 00:35:05,705
It's louder than a cavalry

783
00:35:05,772 --> 00:35:07,763
And I'm patient

784
00:35:07,841 --> 00:35:10,537
Patient as a clock

785
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:12,908
It is to feel the way

When you're countin'
every tick and tock

787
00:35:15,215 --> 00:35:19,413
Show me how to
catch a fish

Thanks for walking me
up here, Sam.

No problem.

791

Oh, God,
I really had fun.

792
00:35:29,362 --> 00:35:30,920
I did.
I- you, uh...

793
00:35:30,997 --> 00:35:33,932
You really took
my mind off Nick.

794
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,902
Aw, come on.
We both know there is no Nick.

795
00:35:37,971 --> 00:35:40,337
There certainly
is a Nick.

Not here.
Not now.

797

What are you doing?.

798
00:35:45,779 --> 00:35:48,441
This is called
mounting an offensive.

799
00:35:48,515 --> 00:35:50,039
Okay. Come on.

800
00:35:50,116 --> 00:35:51,947
Now, we know nobody's gonna be
mounting anybody around here.

801
00:35:52,018 --> 00:35:53,781
You're right. You're right.
Right. I'm sorry.

802
00:35:53,853 --> 00:35:54,877
All right?.

What, uh, what did
you come here to ask me?.

963
00:43:19,165 --> 00:43:20,530
All right.

964
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:24,331
All right,
it's a proposition, actually.

965
00:43:24,403 --> 00:43:27,304
I will pay you $ 1,000
if you will come to New York City

966
00:43:27,373 --> 00:43:29,705
and have dinner with me
and some people that I work with.

967
00:43:29,775 --> 00:43:31,140
I'll buy you
a plane ticket,

968
00:43:31,210 --> 00:43:32,472
I'll buy you a suit
if you need one.

969
00:43:32,545 --> 00:43:33,773
I don't want you
to feel like a thing.

970
00:43:33,846 --> 00:43:35,438
I mean, think of it as,
like, a paid vacation.

971
00:43:35,514 --> 00:43:36,947
You can stay with me.

972
00:43:37,016 --> 00:43:40,850
You know, you can't
work with that cast, right?. And...

973
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:43,013
Okay, so this
is the plan.

974
00:43:43,089 --> 00:43:45,853
Two-thirds of the way through the
dinner, you would pick a fight with me.

975
00:43:45,925 --> 00:43:48,985
And we would have,
like, a quarrel, right?.

976
00:43:49,061 --> 00:43:50,289
And everybody would
watch us break up.

977
00:43:50,363 --> 00:43:52,331
You would never
have to see me again.

978
00:43:52,398 --> 00:43:54,298
And, you know,
there it is.

979
00:43:54,367 --> 00:43:56,130
Wow. That really
sounds like something

980
00:43:56,202 --> 00:43:58,898
right out of The Patty Duke Show,
doesn't it?. Ha ha.

981
00:43:58,971 --> 00:44:00,302
Oh.

982
00:44:00,373 --> 00:44:02,671
You want to pay me
to have dinner with you?.

983
00:44:07,346 --> 00:44:08,506
Yeah.

984
00:44:11,984 --> 00:44:13,918
Uh...

985
00:44:13,986 --> 00:44:15,510

00:44:20,226 --> 00:44:21,420
Okay.

989

That's...
That's a no, right?.

990
00:44:24,630 --> 00:44:26,120
See, the thing is,

991
00:44:26,198 --> 00:44:32,137
I was, uh, thinking
of coming to New York, you know...

992
00:44:32,204 --> 00:44:35,640
and, uh, you know, I was gonna
get your number from Susan

993
00:44:35,708 --> 00:44:41,442
and, uh, ask you if you wanted
to have dinner with me.

994
00:44:41,514 --> 00:44:46,474
So, yes. You, uh... Figure out
what night is best for you

995
00:44:46,552 --> 00:44:48,452
because I'm pretty
flexible, you know?.

996
00:44:48,521 --> 00:44:51,251
So if you want to bring a friend
or people you work with,

997
00:44:51,324 --> 00:44:52,621
that's up to you,

998
00:44:52,692 --> 00:44:56,628
and it's good we ran into
each other again like this.

999
00:44:56,696 --> 00:44:59,256
So think about what I said, and I'll
give you a call tomorrow. Okay?.

1000
00:45:02,468 --> 00:45:04,436

the way to New York

find an hour

future mother-in-law.

is that we met in college,

1053
00:47:26,245 --> 00:47:27,906
but we were
just friends

1054

and that we re-met at this
reunion thing, like, 5 years later.

1055
00:47:30,249 --> 00:47:31,682
It was sort of like,

really got ignited, you know?.

you went to Boston University,

I went, and everybody knows that.

but I kind of fudged
about the wedding part.

1070
00:47:56,876 --> 00:47:59,242

think it's music videos.

00:50:01,734 --> 00:50:04,259
I mean, I know it's your first night
in a strange city.

1117
00:50:04,336 --> 00:50:06,099
He just sounded
so panicked.

1118
00:50:06,172 --> 00:50:07,730
He?.

1119
00:50:07,807 --> 00:50:09,399
Oh! I have
something for you.

1120
00:50:09,475 --> 00:50:10,908
Oh.

1121
00:50:15,981 --> 00:50:18,006
If you could look at this
while I'm gone,

1122
00:50:18,083 --> 00:50:19,607
that would be great.

1123
00:50:19,685 --> 00:50:21,414
Yeah. What is it?.

1124
00:50:21,487 --> 00:50:25,321
Well, it's sort of
a study guide, actually.

1125
00:50:25,391 --> 00:50:28,224
It's, you know,
our life together.

1126
00:50:28,294 --> 00:50:30,421
My hobbies,
my ex-boyfriends,

1127
00:50:30,496 --> 00:50:34,125
uh, what happened to me
during the 5 years we were apart,

1128
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:36,225
our reunion, things I've said
to people about you...

1129
00:50:36,302 --> 00:50:37,701
Wow! You've really
put a lot of work into this.

1130
00:50:37,770 --> 00:50:39,032
Yeah.

1131
00:50:39,104 --> 00:50:40,196
Well, it's my life.

1132
00:50:40,272 --> 00:50:41,569
Sort of.

1133
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:44,609
Okay, and then
there's this.

1134
00:50:44,677 --> 00:50:46,702
Oh, hey, the, uh...

1135
00:50:46,779 --> 00:50:48,974
Yeah, this is the fight that we're
gonna have tomorrow night.

1136
00:50:49,048 --> 00:50:51,983
Um, so I sort of-
I wrote it out like a play, so...

1137
00:50:52,051 --> 00:50:53,985
Okay. "Look, I'm sorry, Kate,
but I can no longer accept that-"

1138
00:50:54,053 --> 00:50:54,985
This is me, right?.

1139
00:50:55,054 --> 00:50:55,986
Yeah.

1140
00:50:56,055 --> 00:50:57,488
" I'm sorry, Kate,
but I can no longer

1141
00:50:57,556 --> 00:50:59,387
"accept the time and energy
you put into your work.

1142
00:50:59,458 --> 00:51:00,823
"There has to be
something left for me.

1143
00:51:00,893 --> 00:51:02,690
Every minute of every day
can't be about Mercer Advertising. "

1144
00:51:02,761 --> 00:51:04,058
Yeah. Right.

1145
00:51:04,129 --> 00:51:06,757
So, you know, it doesn't have to be
verbatim, basically.

1146
00:51:06,832 --> 00:51:08,629
I mean, you can put it
into your own words.

1147
00:51:08,701 --> 00:51:10,862
Oh, oh, yeah.
I think I will.

1148
00:51:10,936 --> 00:51:13,200
Great. No, but as long as you
get the basic point across,

1149
00:51:13,272 --> 00:51:14,762
you know,
like you've had it.

1150
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:18,139
I'm always at work,
my mind is always on my work.

1151
00:51:18,210 --> 00:51:19,768
So I thought that
would be sort of a nice touch,

1152
00:51:19,845 --> 00:51:22,245
if our breakup sort of reaffirmed
my commitment to the firm.

1153
00:51:22,314 --> 00:51:24,179
Well, yeah.
That sounds smart.

1154
00:51:24,250 --> 00:51:27,447
Okay, great, so I'll be at this place
called Man Ray.

1155
00:51:27,519 --> 00:51:30,352
It's in the phone book
if you need me,

1156
00:51:30,422 --> 00:51:32,788
but I really- I should just
be an hour.

1157
00:51:34,193 --> 00:51:36,252
Oh... thanks, Nick,

1158
00:51:36,328 --> 00:51:40,458
for coming down here
and doing this.

1159
00:51:53,078 --> 00:51:54,978
[ Music Playing]

1160
00:52:00,452 --> 00:52:01,749
I'm really
embarrassed.

1161
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:04,152
I mean, I've been babbling
for what, like, two hours now?.

1162
00:52:04,223 --> 00:52:05,815
Oh, come on, Sam.
Don't be embarrassed.

1163
00:52:05,891 --> 00:52:06,983
I don't usually
react this way.

1164
00:52:07,059 --> 00:52:08,424
You were
kissing your fianc.

1165
00:52:08,494 --> 00:52:10,928
It's a perfectly normal thing
for you to be doing.

1166
00:52:10,996 --> 00:52:13,191
I don't know why
it had such an effect on me.

1167
00:52:13,265 --> 00:52:14,892
It's okay, Sam,
it's really okay.

1168
00:52:14,967 --> 00:52:17,333
But you know what?.
I did tell him an hour-

1169
00:52:17,403 --> 00:52:18,267
How did he do it?.

1170
00:52:18,337 --> 00:52:19,429
What?. Do what?.

1171
00:52:19,505 --> 00:52:21,439
Propose. I mean,
did he get down on one knee?.

1172
00:52:21,507 --> 00:52:22,769
What did he say?.

1173
00:52:22,841 --> 00:52:24,274
Oh...

1174
00:52:24,343 --> 00:52:25,935
Oh, God.
I'm sorry.

1175
00:52:26,011 --> 00:52:27,410
Why?. For what?.

1176
00:52:27,479 --> 00:52:29,777
Well,
for the other night.

1177
00:52:29,848 --> 00:52:33,284
And the other...
other night.

1178
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:35,949
Kate.

1179
00:52:36,021 --> 00:52:36,953
Yeah?.

1180
00:52:38,390 --> 00:52:41,655
If I had
known you first...

1181
00:52:41,727 --> 00:52:44,252
would it have
made a difference?.

1182
00:52:47,366 --> 00:52:48,799
Sam...

1183
00:52:48,867 --> 00:52:51,665
Okay. I gotto
tell you something.

1184
00:52:51,737 --> 00:52:52,704
Okay?.

1185
00:52:52,771 --> 00:52:56,468
It has to do with me
and, uh, Nick-

1186
00:52:56,542 --> 00:52:57,975
Nick: Somebody
mention my name?.

1187
00:52:58,043 --> 00:52:59,442
Oh, my God! Hi!

1188
00:52:59,511 --> 00:53:00,375
Hi!

1189
00:53:00,446 --> 00:53:01,811
Nick-oop.

1190
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:02,812
Unh-

1191
00:53:02,881 --> 00:53:03,813
Mmm.

1192
00:53:05,551 --> 00:53:08,486
That's, uh,
that's a kiss from college.

1193
00:53:08,554 --> 00:53:09,486
Boston University
thing. Ha!

1194
00:53:09,555 --> 00:53:12,615
Uh, Nick,
this is Sam Mayfair.

1195
00:53:12,691 --> 00:53:14,022
We work together
at Mercer.

1196
00:53:14,093 --> 00:53:15,185
And, uh...

1197
00:53:15,260 --> 00:53:17,660
This is, uh,
this is my Nick.

1198
00:53:17,730 --> 00:53:18,662
Sam: Wow.

1199
00:53:18,731 --> 00:53:20,028
Your Nick.

1200
00:53:20,099 --> 00:53:21,964
And you're Nick.

1201
00:53:22,034 --> 00:53:23,433
That's your Nick.

1202
00:53:23,502 --> 00:53:25,436
I may have had
a little too much to drink.

1203
00:53:25,504 --> 00:53:26,766
I'm her Sam.

1204
00:53:28,774 --> 00:53:31,436
It certainly is an honor
to have met you, Nick.

1205
00:53:31,510 --> 00:53:33,944
I mean, you know,
you've been the topic

1206
00:53:34,013 --> 00:53:36,948
of a lot of conversation
and speculation around here.

1207
00:53:37,016 --> 00:53:39,951
I'm very sorry that I monopolized
your fiance's evening,

1208
00:53:40,019 --> 00:53:42,954
but I've just come to realize
that she's...

1209
00:53:43,022 --> 00:53:44,956
Damn it. She's just
the kind of girl

1210
00:53:45,024 --> 00:53:46,855
you'd like to
monopolize, you know?.

1211
00:53:46,925 --> 00:53:48,222
Oh!

1212
00:53:48,293 --> 00:53:49,658
Nick: Is everything
okay in there?.

1213
00:53:49,728 --> 00:53:52,458
Ha ha ha!

1214
00:53:52,531 --> 00:53:55,523
What?. Is that guy-
Is he your boyfriend?.

1215
00:53:55,601 --> 00:53:56,795
Oh, him?. No.

1216
00:53:56,869 --> 00:53:57,927
No. He's
just a friend.

1217
00:53:58,003 --> 00:53:58,935
Oh.

1218
00:53:59,004 --> 00:54:00,198
Sleeps over
sometimes,

1219
00:54:00,272 --> 00:54:02,103
but he's
just a friend.

1220
00:54:02,174 --> 00:54:03,875
Aha.

1221
00:54:04,442 --> 00:54:07,275
Roger.

1222
00:54:07,345 --> 00:54:08,778
Mike.

1223
00:54:11,349 --> 00:54:13,783
Ivan.

1224
00:54:13,851 --> 00:54:16,615
Sure is a lot of
boyfriends in here.

1225
00:54:16,687 --> 00:54:18,882
Yeah. So?.

1226
00:54:18,956 --> 00:54:20,890
Going somewhere
with that?.

1227
00:54:20,958 --> 00:54:23,722
No. No, no, no.

1228
00:54:23,794 --> 00:54:26,388
Not me.

1229
00:54:26,464 --> 00:54:30,730
Just, uh, your life's
a real page-turner. That's all.

1230
00:54:30,801 --> 00:54:33,565
Mmm.

1231
00:54:33,638 --> 00:54:36,402
Oh! There's something
I forgot to ask you.

1232
00:54:36,474 --> 00:54:38,601
How come there's nothing in the book
about your father?.

1233
00:54:42,980 --> 00:54:46,916
Well... nothing
really to talk about.

1234
00:54:48,486 --> 00:54:52,923
I mean, he and my mother
split when I was 7,

1235
00:54:52,990 --> 00:54:57,427
and I didn't see him again
for 10 years and then, uh...

1236
00:54:57,495 --> 00:54:59,190
and then he passed away.

1237
00:54:59,263 --> 00:55:00,924
I'm sorry.

1238
00:55:00,998 --> 00:55:03,432
Don't be.
I mean...

1239
00:55:03,501 --> 00:55:06,402
I really barely
remember the guy.

1240
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:13,877
He had a pair
of plaid pajamas.

1241
00:55:15,947 --> 00:55:17,881
Ohh...

1242
00:55:17,949 --> 00:55:23,888
Oh, and I remember, um,
one night after work...

1243
00:55:25,456 --> 00:55:28,892
He took me to
the department store,

1244
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:31,895
just-just him and me,

1245
00:55:31,963 --> 00:55:35,899
and, um, he bought me
my first watch.

1246
00:55:35,967 --> 00:55:40,404
It was one of those Cinderella watches,
you know, um...

1247
00:55:40,471 --> 00:55:41,961
Do you know what
I'm talking about?.

1248
00:55:42,039 --> 00:55:43,006
Mm-hmm.

1249
00:55:43,074 --> 00:55:49,411
And, um, I remember
thinking to myself,

1250
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:52,472
this is really special.

1251
00:55:53,985 --> 00:55:56,920
If I'd known
he was going to leave,

1252
00:55:56,988 --> 00:55:59,422
I would have taken a little better
care of the thing, you know...

1253
00:55:59,490 --> 00:56:01,981
hung on to it.

1254
00:56:06,931 --> 00:56:12,426
Huh. It's weird,
the things you remember.

1255
00:56:12,503 --> 00:56:13,936
Okay, my birthday?.

1256
00:56:14,005 --> 00:56:15,370
April 3, 1968.

1257
00:56:15,439 --> 00:56:17,373
Okay, you can leave
out the year.

1258
00:56:17,441 --> 00:56:18,373
First job?.

1259
00:56:18,442 --> 00:56:20,376
You were
a junior copywriter,

1260
00:56:20,444 --> 00:56:23,880
but you were promoted
to full copywriter in 5 short months.

1261
00:56:23,948 --> 00:56:25,381
Career ambition?.

1262
00:56:25,449 --> 00:56:27,383
Total world domination.
Do you want to get some breakfast?.

1263
00:56:27,451 --> 00:56:28,884
No. There's no time.

1264
00:56:28,953 --> 00:56:30,386
Can I ask
you something?.

1265
00:56:30,454 --> 00:56:31,887
Yeah.

1266
00:56:31,956 --> 00:56:33,890
Don't you, uh, don't you
need to learn about me?.

1267
00:56:33,958 --> 00:56:35,391
What do you mean?.

1268
00:56:35,459 --> 00:56:37,893
Well, you know, I'm really
boning up here about you.

1269
00:56:37,962 --> 00:56:39,896
I mean, don't you think you should
learn a little about me?.

1270
00:56:39,964 --> 00:56:41,898
Yeah, but, Nick, you're forgetting.
This isn't about you.

1271
00:56:41,966 --> 00:56:43,900
I mean,
not the real you.

1272

This is about
the you that I made up.

1273

Oh, you know what
I need to learn?.

1274
00:56:48,973 --> 00:56:49,905
What?.

1275
00:56:49,974 --> 00:56:51,407

your coffee?.

Light, Sweet 'N Low.
Why?.

1277
00:56:53,010 --> 00:56:55,410
Well, you know, that's just stuff
I should know cold at dinnertime.

1278
00:56:55,479 --> 00:56:57,413
When people are involved,
they know that stuff.

1279
00:56:57,481 --> 00:56:59,415
Oh, right.
No, you're right.

1280
00:56:59,483 --> 00:57:00,916
You got
a favorite drink?.

1281
00:57:00,985 --> 00:57:02,919
I mean, 'cause I don't want to
have to ask in front of everybody.

1282
00:57:02,987 --> 00:57:04,352
Dirty Martini.

1283
00:57:04,422 --> 00:57:06,356
Okay.

1284
00:57:06,424 --> 00:57:07,823
Well, what about you?.

1285
00:57:07,892 --> 00:57:09,359
What about me?.

1286
00:57:09,427 --> 00:57:11,861
I mean, I think I should at least
know how you take your coffee.

1287
00:57:11,929 --> 00:57:13,863
Well, I'm confused.
You don't know?.

1288

She had this cat
named Jerry till she was 15.

I didn't know her then, but I keep
threatening to get her a new cat.

1298

Mm-hmm. Final Jeopardy.
Personal imperfections.

1299
00:57:33,451 --> 00:57:34,884
She has the cutest
little appendix scar,

1300
00:57:34,952 --> 00:57:37,386
and of course there's
her birthmark that-

1301
00:57:37,455 --> 00:57:39,389
Oh, honey, I wasn't supposed to
mention that. I'm sorry.

1302
00:57:39,457 --> 00:57:40,890
All right.

1303
00:57:40,958 --> 00:57:43,893
Then there's her glass eye
and her artificial hip

1304
00:57:43,961 --> 00:57:45,690
and her wooden leg.

1305
00:57:45,763 --> 00:57:46,695
Good evening.

1306

Hi.

Want a seat?.

1308
00:57:49,266 --> 00:57:50,699
Sure. Go ahead.

1309
00:57:54,472 --> 00:57:56,406
Mr. Mercer:
I mean, as I sit here,

1310
00:57:56,474 --> 00:57:58,908
the thing I see when I
look at the two of you,

1311
00:57:58,976 --> 00:58:03,675
the thing that moves me
is your unconditional love.

1312
00:58:03,747 --> 00:58:04,839
Hear, hear.

1313
00:58:04,915 --> 00:58:06,109
Thank you.

1314
00:58:06,183 --> 00:58:09,346
That means so much to us,
especially coming from you.

1315
00:58:09,420 --> 00:58:12,355
I mean, you're married,
and you really know.

1316
00:58:12,423 --> 00:58:13,856
Darcy: Yeah.

1317
00:58:13,924 --> 00:58:16,358
Kate: Except for you, Darcy.
You've only been married 5 years.

have been married,

1322
00:58:26,437 --> 00:58:29,372
4 years. Second marriage
for both of us.

1323

Ha ha!

for the second time once.

what you're talking about.

So, Nick, tell me
about videos.

Well, uh, what
would you like to know?.

1335

Well, um, how did you
get into that line of work?.

1336
00:59:02,973 --> 00:59:04,338
I mean, I watch
them all the time.

1337
00:59:04,408 --> 00:59:06,842
A lot of smoke, a lot
of half-naked girls.

1338

Well, it seems like a decent way
to make a living.

1339
00:59:08,512 --> 00:59:11,606
Huh. Really?.

1340
00:59:14,919 --> 00:59:18,582
Those aren't really
the kind of videos I do.

1341
00:59:18,656 --> 00:59:22,353
Oh, I don't understand.
They all seem pretty much the same.

1342
00:59:22,426 --> 00:59:24,121
What-What kind
do you do?.

1343
00:59:24,195 --> 00:59:28,825
I videotape weddings.

1344
00:59:28,899 --> 00:59:34,360
Oh. Well, that-
That is different.

1345
00:59:34,438 --> 00:59:36,736
Um, well, how did
you get into that?.

1346
00:59:41,946 --> 00:59:44,881
Uh, I was looking
for a job

1347
00:59:44,949 --> 00:59:46,473
that would require me to work
as few days a week as possible,

1348
00:59:46,550 --> 00:59:50,384
and your midweek wedding
is a pretty unusual occurrence.

1349
00:59:50,454 --> 00:59:53,719
You can actually make
a living that way?.

1350
00:59:53,791 --> 00:59:56,385
Videotaping a wedding
or two on the weekends?.

1351
00:59:56,460 --> 00:59:57,950
I mean, that
satisfies you?.

1352
00:59:58,028 --> 00:59:59,962
No.

1353
01:00:00,030 --> 01:00:03,431
But once I started
videotaping people's weddings,

1354
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:06,833
they would, you know,
come up to me for other things.

1355
01:00:06,904 --> 01:00:09,930
You know, "My wife's having a baby
shower. Could you videotape that?'

1356
01:00:10,007 --> 01:00:13,340
Or "Hey, my daughter's getting baptized.
Could you come on by?'

1357
01:00:13,410 --> 01:00:15,970
Or "My kid's got the lead in the school
play. You gotto be there. "

1358
01:00:16,046 --> 01:00:22,349
I was working 6, 7 days
a week, and I loved it.

1359
01:00:22,419 --> 01:00:24,410
I can't explain it
really.

1360
01:00:24,488 --> 01:00:28,356
Something about watching a baby being
welcomed to the world by its new family

It's, uh...

1364
01:00:36,433 --> 01:00:38,424
It's an honor.

1365
01:00:38,502 --> 01:00:42,336
It's an honor that these people asked me
to be there for those moments...

1366
01:00:42,406 --> 01:00:45,864
and I get paid for it.
