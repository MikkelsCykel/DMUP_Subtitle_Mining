1
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,800
Guess what.

2
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,600
What?

3
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,800
I can't move.

4
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:03,999
Yeah, well, you don't have to.
You're in a car.

5
00:02:09,798 --> 00:02:11,798
Am I driving?

6
00:02:13,398 --> 00:02:14,998
Like a pro.

7
00:04:05,488 --> 00:04:08,688
Come on, wake up, you fuck.
Come on.

8
00:05:16,881 --> 00:05:19,181
Did you try to help him get free?

9
00:05:21,081 --> 00:05:22,781
Briefly.

10
00:05:22,981 --> 00:05:24,381
Briefly?

11
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:29,680
When it came down to it, my life
was more important to me than his.

12
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,179
Selfish, huh?

13
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:40,779
We found these...

14
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:46,079
...in your Spider.

15
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:49,178
Actually, I don't drive a Spider
anymore.

16
00:05:49,378 --> 00:05:51,778
Now I have a C8 Laviolette.

17
00:05:51,978 --> 00:05:54,078
It's lighter, faster...

18
00:05:54,278 --> 00:05:56,178
...swims better.

19
00:06:18,576 --> 00:06:19,876
Right.

20
00:06:20,076 --> 00:06:22,775
These three contain traces
of ketamine...

21
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:25,875
...the same as we found in your blood
and his.

22
00:06:26,075 --> 00:06:31,274
This one had pure D-Tubocurarine,
DTC...

23
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:34,174
...which we only found in him.

24
00:06:34,674 --> 00:06:37,374
Must've been something
he took at the party.

25
00:06:37,574 --> 00:06:40,073
No. DTC is not a party drug.

26
00:06:40,273 --> 00:06:43,673
Along with the other stuff in his blood,
it paralyzed his lungs.

27
00:06:43,973 --> 00:06:46,073
Kevin Franks did not drown.

28
00:06:46,273 --> 00:06:51,173
He had already stopped breathing
by the time you drove off the road.

29
00:06:51,373 --> 00:06:53,473
He was breathing
when we went off the road.

30
00:06:53,673 --> 00:06:54,672
How do you know?

31
00:06:54,872 --> 00:06:56,172
He was making me come.

32
00:06:57,572 --> 00:07:01,772
What? You were having sex
at 100 miles an hour?

33
00:07:02,072 --> 00:07:05,871
Hundred and ten.
I must've hit a pothole.

34
00:07:07,171 --> 00:07:09,471
Your friend, Dickie Pep...

35
00:07:09,771 --> 00:07:14,270
...says he sold you 15 milliliters
of DTC last Thursday.

36
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:18,270
I don't know any Dickie Pep,
but he's lying.

37
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:19,470
Or you are.

38
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:20,670
Why would he lie?

39
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:24,370
You got him on some other charge
and he's trying to deal his way out.

40
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:25,970
If he even exists.

41
00:07:29,369 --> 00:07:32,769
You don't seem too upset by what's
happened.

42
00:07:32,969 --> 00:07:35,169
Of course I am, I'm traumatized.

43
00:07:37,468 --> 00:07:40,168
Who knows if I'll ever come again?

44
00:07:43,567 --> 00:07:45,567
I want that cunt in jail.

45
00:07:45,767 --> 00:07:47,567
We haven't got a case, Roy.

46
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:51,867
Well, just fucking make one. Please.

47
00:07:52,067 --> 00:07:54,667
They'll order a psychiatric for bail.

48
00:07:54,867 --> 00:07:57,667
I'll make sure we get somebody
good and tough.

49
00:08:21,364 --> 00:08:25,864
Dr. Glass. I'm Henry Rose,
Miss Tramell's solicitor.

50
00:08:26,064 --> 00:08:28,264
This is Catherine Tramell.

51
00:08:28,764 --> 00:08:31,464
I shall be present during
the evaluation.

52
00:08:32,164 --> 00:08:33,863
Well, that's fine by me.

53
00:08:34,063 --> 00:08:38,463
I'll be asking fairly personal questions.
If she doesn't mind your presence...

54
00:08:38,663 --> 00:08:41,962
My client understands and agrees
I should be present for...

55
00:08:42,162 --> 00:08:45,162
Maybe Dr. Glass is right
and we should be alone for this.

56
00:08:45,362 --> 00:08:48,262
I strongly advise you
not to contemplate having...

57
00:08:48,462 --> 00:08:51,161
So is this where
we're going to do it?

58
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,760
Mr. Rose told you the purpose
of this evaluation.

59
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,260
I'm applying for bail in a murder case.

60
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:16,359
The Crown wants to know
if I'm a danger to myself or others.

61
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:19,559
You're the Crown's shrink,
so you'll say I'm dangerous.

62
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:22,858
My shrink will say I'm not,
and the judge will flip a coin.

63
00:09:24,258 --> 00:09:27,658
Anything you tell me can be quoted
verbatim in testimony...

64
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:29,158
...and can affect your case.

65
00:09:29,358 --> 00:09:30,958
You can quote me all you want.

66
00:09:31,158 --> 00:09:32,158
Thank you.

67
00:09:34,658 --> 00:09:36,858
Well, I see that you're a writer.

68
00:09:38,257 --> 00:09:39,857
What do you write about?

69
00:09:40,057 --> 00:09:42,857
Murder, sex, violence.

70
00:09:43,057 --> 00:09:45,257
Do you ever write about yourself?

71
00:09:45,457 --> 00:09:47,456
Not into autobiography.

72
00:09:47,656 --> 00:09:48,956
Really? Why not?

73
00:09:49,156 --> 00:09:53,356
Maybe I like to just sit back and get
other people to reveal themselves.

74
00:09:56,255 --> 00:09:59,055
For instance,
you look a little divorced.

75
00:09:59,555 --> 00:10:01,655
What makes you think I'm divorced?

76
00:10:01,955 --> 00:10:04,055
The ring line hasn't faded.

77
00:10:07,155 --> 00:10:08,655
You're very observant.

78
00:10:08,855 --> 00:10:10,754
Yeah, but am I wrong?

79
00:10:11,054 --> 00:10:13,154
Would it bother you
if you were wrong?

80
00:10:13,354 --> 00:10:15,554
Would it bother you if I was right?

81
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:23,653
Tell me something you're afraid of.

82
00:10:28,652 --> 00:10:29,752
Boredom.

83
00:10:30,052 --> 00:10:31,852
Is that why you like to take risks?

84
00:10:32,852 --> 00:10:35,152
I do like to take risks.

85
00:10:35,352 --> 00:10:38,652
Like taking drugs and having sex
in a speeding car?

86
00:10:38,852 --> 00:10:41,852
Like talking to me
without having your lawyer present?

87
00:10:43,251 --> 00:10:45,751
Actually, that was your idea.

88
00:10:45,951 --> 00:10:50,151
Like being on trial for murder? That's
risky. You could end up in prison.

89
00:10:50,351 --> 00:10:51,450
Not if I'm innocent.

90
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:54,050
Innocent people end up in prison
all the time.

91
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:57,850
Not rich, innocent people who are
represented by Henry Rose.

92
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:01,249
In that case, it isn't really exciting
unless you're guilty.

93
00:11:04,849 --> 00:11:09,449
Oh, I bet you like to take risks,
don't you, Dr. Glass?

94
00:11:09,649 --> 00:11:12,149
But I'm not the one who's on trial
for murder.

95
00:11:12,349 --> 00:11:13,849
Not yet.

96
00:11:20,348 --> 00:11:22,948
Sorry, you're not allowed
to smoke in here.

97
00:11:30,747 --> 00:11:33,146
You know what I like about you?

98
00:11:33,346 --> 00:11:36,146
You enjoy being in control.

99
00:11:42,246 --> 00:11:43,746
Like me.

100
00:11:58,344 --> 00:12:00,744
Sorry, sir. Can't let you through here.

101
00:12:01,944 --> 00:12:06,243
Well, I would say extremely intelligent.
Gifted, accomplished.

102
00:12:06,443 --> 00:12:07,743
Yet inside, I believe...

103
00:12:07,943 --> 00:12:11,543
...she vacillates between
a feeling of godlike omnipotence...

104
00:12:11,743 --> 00:12:14,543
...and a sense
that she simply doesn't exist...

105
00:12:14,743 --> 00:12:16,943
...which, of course, is intolerable.

106
00:12:17,143 --> 00:12:21,043
Do you consider Miss Tramell to be
mentally impaired?

107
00:12:21,242 --> 00:12:24,142
Not by legal definition, no. Not at all.

108
00:12:24,342 --> 00:12:28,742
If released, is she likely
to commit a violent crime?

109
00:12:30,141 --> 00:12:33,941
I believe her behavior is driven
by what we call a risk addiction.

110
00:12:34,441 --> 00:12:37,840
A compulsive need to prove to herself
that she can take risks...

111
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,040
...and survive dangers others can't.

112
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:45,240
Especially the subsequent encounters
with the police or the powers that be.

113
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:47,240
Why would a person do that?

114
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:51,240
The greater the risk, the greater the
proof of her omnipotence.

115
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,640
Her existence, really.

116
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:57,439
When you say she has
a risk addiction...

117
00:12:57,639 --> 00:13:00,039
...is this condition likely to get
worse?

118
00:13:00,239 --> 00:13:01,739
All addiction is progressive.

119
00:13:01,938 --> 00:13:04,538
The addict always needs to take
greater risks.

120
00:13:04,738 --> 00:13:07,138
If other people are hurt or killed...

121
00:13:07,338 --> 00:13:10,737
...as a result of her behavior,
that's not likely to stop her?

122
00:13:10,937 --> 00:13:13,437
I think the only thing
that'd stop her...

123
00:13:17,737 --> 00:13:21,137
I suspect the only limit for her
would be her own death.

124
00:13:24,337 --> 00:13:26,836
Then she is a danger to herself.

125
00:13:28,336 --> 00:13:30,136
Yes, I believe she is.

126
00:13:37,635 --> 00:13:40,035
Nice work, Michael. Well done.

127
00:13:41,835 --> 00:13:45,134
Dr. Glass, did Catherine Tramell
kill Kevin Franks?

128
00:13:45,334 --> 00:13:47,734
No, I can't make any comment, sorry.

129
00:13:47,934 --> 00:13:50,334
Can you please tell us about the bail?

130
00:13:52,334 --> 00:13:57,134
Dr. Michael Glass. What a big thing
you are all of a sudden.

131
00:13:57,334 --> 00:14:01,833
What are you doing here, Adam?
Don't say you're writing about Tramell.

132
00:14:02,033 --> 00:14:04,833
A sexy, omnipotent killer
with a Random House contract.

133
00:14:05,033 --> 00:14:06,233
Why would I write that?

134
00:14:06,433 --> 00:14:07,932
You don't know she's a killer.

135
00:14:08,132 --> 00:14:11,732
No, but I hope she is, though.
I mean, I pray to God she is.

136
00:14:11,932 --> 00:14:15,032
By the way, I hear you were
brilliant in there.

137
00:14:15,232 --> 00:14:18,331
You're so lucid sometimes,
it's just disgusting.

138
00:14:18,531 --> 00:14:20,731
You thought about daytime television?

139
00:14:20,931 --> 00:14:24,431
Denise always says you were born
for the small screen.

140
00:14:24,731 --> 00:14:27,331
And how is my wife these days?
Having fun?

141
00:14:27,631 --> 00:14:30,931
Ex-wife, Michael. Ex-wife.

142
00:14:31,131 --> 00:14:33,530
While we're chatting about killers...

143
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:36,830
...is there any chance of talking about
George Cheslav?

144
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:38,930
Who told you about Cheslav?

145
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:40,329
Denise?

146
00:14:40,529 --> 00:14:43,829
That's got to be any shrink's worst
nightmare.

147
00:14:44,029 --> 00:14:47,029
A patient in your care
suddenly runs amok...

148
00:14:47,229 --> 00:14:49,128
...beats his girlfriend to death
with a brick.

149
00:14:49,328 --> 00:14:52,028
That was seven years ago,
why talk about it now?

150
00:14:52,228 --> 00:14:55,228
Not quite seven, actually.
Seven in July.

151
00:14:55,428 --> 00:15:00,328
But you talked to him twice a week.
He never indicated he'd harm the girl?

152
00:15:00,628 --> 00:15:03,028
I don't talk about my patients.

153
00:15:03,228 --> 00:15:06,927
Cheslav's dead. Can't you talk
about them when they're dead?

154
00:15:07,127 --> 00:15:09,827
No, not even when they're dead.

155
00:15:38,124 --> 00:15:39,824
Michael, what are you doing here?

156
00:15:40,024 --> 00:15:43,424
What did you tell Adam Towers
about George Cheslav?

157
00:15:43,624 --> 00:15:45,024
Nothing.

158
00:15:46,423 --> 00:15:48,423
Can you give us a minute?

159
00:15:49,923 --> 00:15:51,523
He already knew.

160
00:15:54,422 --> 00:15:58,022
Really? Because he said you told him.

161
00:15:58,222 --> 00:16:00,322
No, all I said was...

162
00:16:00,522 --> 00:16:04,022
If he writes about that, if he puts it
on his magazine cover...

163
00:16:04,222 --> 00:16:06,122
He won't. You're just being paranoid.

164
00:16:06,422 --> 00:16:07,822
You didn't do anything wrong.

165
00:16:08,022 --> 00:16:12,421
Right. I didn't. I was treating a patient
that killed his pregnant girlfriend.

166
00:16:12,621 --> 00:16:15,521
End of story.
You make sure he gets that.

167
00:16:15,721 --> 00:16:17,021
Don't worry.

168
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:27,619
I'm up for the Douglas Chair
at the university.

169
00:16:27,819 --> 00:16:31,719
You know what that means to me.
Do you think this is going to help?

170
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:33,619
I can't tell Adam what to write.

171
00:16:33,819 --> 00:16:34,819
Why not?

172
00:16:35,019 --> 00:16:36,019
Don't be stupid.

173
00:16:36,219 --> 00:16:40,119
I think you're entitled to since you've
been fucking him for over a year.

174
00:16:40,319 --> 00:16:43,318
Do you think I didn't know
when it started?

175
00:16:43,518 --> 00:16:47,018
It's a pity you never asked yourself
why it started.

176
00:16:56,317 --> 00:16:59,216
How was the court case
with the mystery writer?

177
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:01,016
I hear she looks fabulous.

178
00:17:01,216 --> 00:17:05,016
Also very intelligent.
Pathological liar. Narcissistic.

179
00:17:05,216 --> 00:17:07,516
Seductive, manipulative.

180
00:17:07,716 --> 00:17:09,916
Do you think she killed the footballer?

181
00:17:10,116 --> 00:17:11,116
I have no idea.

182
00:17:11,316 --> 00:17:14,316
Everything she does is so perfectly
composed.

183
00:17:14,516 --> 00:17:17,015
It's designed to confuse
or confound you.

184
00:17:17,215 --> 00:17:21,315
You never know what's truth
and what isn't. She's brilliant, really.

185
00:17:21,515 --> 00:17:23,514
The masked psychotic. Your favorite.

186
00:17:23,714 --> 00:17:27,214
I'm already working it into a paper:
"Risk Addiction and Omnipotence."

187
00:17:27,414 --> 00:17:28,614
You're writing another already?

188
00:17:28,814 --> 00:17:31,214
I'm writing two,
but this is the more interesting.

189
00:17:31,414 --> 00:17:33,113
I'll catch you up.

190
00:17:33,313 --> 00:17:34,613
Hello?

191
00:17:34,813 --> 00:17:38,413
Glass? It's Roy Washburn.
Are you near a television set?

192
00:17:38,613 --> 00:17:41,313
<i>If you'll be quiet, I'll make a
statement.</i>

193
00:17:41,513 --> 00:17:42,513
What happened?

194
00:17:42,713 --> 00:17:44,013
<i>The judge let her go.</i>

195
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:45,213
Let her go? Why?

196
00:17:45,513 --> 00:17:47,713
<i>The guy who said
he sold her the D TC...</i>

197
00:17:47,912 --> 00:17:51,012
<i>... the judge found out he'd perjured
himself in another case...</i>

198
00:17:51,212 --> 00:17:55,012
<i>... and disqualified him as a witness.
But I'll make you a bet.</i>

199
00:17:55,212 --> 00:17:56,211
What's that?

200
00:17:56,411 --> 00:17:57,611
<i>She'll do it again.</i>

201
00:17:57,811 --> 00:17:58,911
<i>And soon.</i>

202
00:17:59,111 --> 00:18:03,111
<i>Only this time
I will fucking nail the bitch.</i>

203
00:18:21,009 --> 00:18:25,309
So we've been considering those who
wish to control others...

204
00:18:25,509 --> 00:18:28,609
...through their insecurity and their
narcissism.

205
00:18:28,808 --> 00:18:33,208
To study Nietzsche
psychobiographically may seem naive.

206
00:18:33,408 --> 00:18:35,808
Wasn't it Nietzsche's work itself,
which...

207
00:18:36,008 --> 00:18:39,107
...through deconstructive and
post-structuralist readings...

208
00:18:39,307 --> 00:18:41,807
...induced the death of
psychobiography?

209
00:18:46,207 --> 00:18:51,107
Paul Portman said he might go
to Tavistock. I'm thinking I might go.

210
00:18:51,307 --> 00:18:54,806
Just be patient.
Stay where you are for about a year.

211
00:18:55,006 --> 00:18:57,706
- But there's nothing holding me.
- Trust me.

212
00:18:57,906 --> 00:18:59,106
You know Dr. Gerst?

213
00:18:59,506 --> 00:19:01,206
Michael Glass.

214
00:19:01,405 --> 00:19:03,205
It's a pleasure.

215
00:19:03,505 --> 00:19:05,805
I saw your review of my book.

216
00:19:06,005 --> 00:19:09,704
You didn't understand what I was
saying about the analytic field.

217
00:19:09,904 --> 00:19:14,104
Towards the end you made one or two
interesting remarks.

218
00:19:14,304 --> 00:19:17,004
Maybe one of these days
we can discuss it.

219
00:19:17,404 --> 00:19:19,704
I'd be honored. Thank you very much.

220
00:19:21,904 --> 00:19:24,104
"One or two interesting remarks"?

221
00:19:24,304 --> 00:19:28,603
That was a compliment, Michelle.
Dr. Gerst was very impressed.

222
00:19:28,803 --> 00:19:32,103
And it appears that our Michael
has just been knighted.

223
00:19:33,303 --> 00:19:34,602
Cheers.

224
00:19:36,502 --> 00:19:38,302
Congratulations.

225
00:20:15,298 --> 00:20:18,298
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

226
00:20:19,398 --> 00:20:24,698
Every day I see you writing and I am
thinking, "What is he writing about?"

227
00:20:24,898 --> 00:20:26,898
Is it a novel?

228
00:20:27,498 --> 00:20:29,898
No, but there was a novelist in it.

229
00:20:30,098 --> 00:20:33,297
Really? Who?

230
00:20:33,497 --> 00:20:36,797
I can't tell you that.
Otherwise I'd have to kill you.

231
00:20:39,996 --> 00:20:43,196
Must be someone famous, then.

232
00:20:57,895 --> 00:20:59,895
Excuse me. Dr. Glass?

233
00:21:00,095 --> 00:21:02,495
I'm Peter Ristedes.
Adam Towers' assistant.

234
00:21:02,995 --> 00:21:04,894
<i>Urbane magazine.</i>

235
00:21:07,194 --> 00:21:09,094
Mind if I join you?

236
00:21:09,294 --> 00:21:13,893
Adam asked me to see if you'd give us
a quote for the article he's writing.

237
00:21:14,093 --> 00:21:16,093
I believe he mentioned it to you.

238
00:21:17,393 --> 00:21:20,392
He didn't seem to think
you'd want to talk to him.

239
00:21:27,392 --> 00:21:29,992
I'll take that as a "no comment," then?

240
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:48,990
Dr. Glass?

241
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:53,289
Miss Tramell.

242
00:21:54,789 --> 00:21:56,089
What are you doing here?

243
00:21:56,589 --> 00:21:58,489
I wanted to talk to you.

244
00:21:58,689 --> 00:22:00,489
About the evaluation.

245
00:22:01,689 --> 00:22:05,989
Some of the things you said,
I've been thinking about them a lot.

246
00:22:08,589 --> 00:22:10,788
I'm sorry you had to hear all that.

247
00:22:14,388 --> 00:22:15,788
Got a minute?

248
00:22:20,787 --> 00:22:22,187
Come through.

249
00:22:31,186 --> 00:22:36,486
What you said about me
being addicted to risk...

250
00:22:36,686 --> 00:22:39,886
...about having to do more and more
dangerous things...

251
00:22:40,086 --> 00:22:43,385
Well, after you said it...

252
00:22:43,985 --> 00:22:46,385
...I realized I was...

253
00:22:46,585 --> 00:22:48,085
...scared.

254
00:22:49,085 --> 00:22:50,884
What exactly scared you?

255
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:57,584
For weeks before the accident
I was having the same...

256
00:22:58,883 --> 00:23:01,583
...fantasy over and over again.

257
00:23:02,983 --> 00:23:05,083
I even wrote about it.

258
00:23:05,283 --> 00:23:10,383
The woman's driving in the car,
the man's making her come.

259
00:23:10,583 --> 00:23:14,383
She drives off the road,
the man's killed.

260
00:23:14,682 --> 00:23:18,182
I feel like maybe I made it all happen.

261
00:23:19,982 --> 00:23:21,882
That's why I'm here.

262
00:23:22,082 --> 00:23:24,981
Are you saying you'd like to
go into treatment?

263
00:23:27,881 --> 00:23:28,981
Yeah.

264
00:23:29,181 --> 00:23:31,580
Well, I think that's a very good idea.

265
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,980
I wouldn't be able to treat you, but I'd
be happy to refer you to a colleague.

266
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:38,480
Why can't you treat me?

267
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:42,180
It's not advisable for a doctor who's
done a forensic evaluation...

268
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:44,280
...to then become that person's
therapist.

269
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,480
Why not?

270
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:50,179
Therapy requires a great deal of trust,
which is difficult for most people.

271
00:23:50,379 --> 00:23:53,079
It's best to start with a clean slate.

272
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:55,778
You mean you don't trust me.

273
00:23:58,778 --> 00:24:02,578
What I said about you at the hearing
must have seemed very negative.

274
00:24:02,778 --> 00:24:04,677
I'm sure you've got feelings about that.

275
00:24:05,077 --> 00:24:07,477
I'd be happy referring you
to another doctor.

276
00:24:07,777 --> 00:24:11,477
This is Dr. Milena Gardosh.
She has a clinic here in London.

277
00:24:11,677 --> 00:24:13,477
You want to know the truth?

278
00:24:13,677 --> 00:24:18,377
The reason I agreed to the evaluation
was because I thought it would be fun.

279
00:24:18,577 --> 00:24:19,877
I never...

280
00:24:21,876 --> 00:24:24,376
I never talked to anyone who...

281
00:24:40,174 --> 00:24:41,774
My patient's here.

282
00:24:48,474 --> 00:24:49,674
What do I owe you?

283
00:24:49,874 --> 00:24:51,874
You don't owe me anything.

284
00:24:52,074 --> 00:24:56,973
But if you'd like to call Dr. Gardosh,
I'm sure she can help you.

285
00:24:57,173 --> 00:24:59,173
I don't shop around.

286
00:24:59,373 --> 00:25:02,572
Like you said,
trust is very hard to come by.

287
00:25:04,272 --> 00:25:07,572
I was hoping I might find it with you.

288
00:25:11,171 --> 00:25:14,971
Listen, why don't we
schedule another meeting.

289
00:25:15,171 --> 00:25:18,771
And then we can talk about this
when we're not so rushed.

290
00:26:04,367 --> 00:26:07,766
You look different today. More relaxed.

291
00:26:08,166 --> 00:26:12,466
The more nervous I am,
the more relaxed people think I am.

292
00:26:13,466 --> 00:26:17,165
I wanted to talk about something you
brought up last Wednesday.

293
00:26:17,365 --> 00:26:18,965
You said before the accident...

294
00:26:19,165 --> 00:26:23,065
...you had fantasies of sexual
excitement and driving off the road.

295
00:26:23,465 --> 00:26:25,965
Do you often have fantasies like that?

296
00:26:26,165 --> 00:26:27,965
I have fantasies all the time.

297
00:26:29,065 --> 00:26:32,864
Fantasies involving violence, death?

298
00:26:34,464 --> 00:26:36,064
People die in my novels.

299
00:26:36,264 --> 00:26:39,263
I have to think of new and interesting
ways to kill them.

300
00:26:41,263 --> 00:26:43,763
What happens when
you don't take risks?

301
00:26:51,462 --> 00:26:55,362
I'm sorry, there's no smoking in here.
It's a rule.

302
00:26:55,562 --> 00:26:56,962
I don't like rules.

303
00:26:57,162 --> 00:26:59,562
I have some of them,
and that's one of them.

304
00:27:04,361 --> 00:27:06,561
After the hearing...

305
00:27:06,761 --> 00:27:10,861
<i>...I was interviewed by a reporter
from Urbane magazine.</i>

306
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:17,960
Adam Towers. He said he knew you.

307
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,959
Slightly. Why?

308
00:27:21,959 --> 00:27:24,959
He told me about the Cheslav case.

309
00:27:25,159 --> 00:27:28,059
I was impressed by what you did.

310
00:27:28,259 --> 00:27:31,559
You knew Cheslav was dangerous.

311
00:27:31,759 --> 00:27:33,959
Still you protected him.

312
00:27:35,159 --> 00:27:37,658
You honored his confidentiality...

313
00:27:38,058 --> 00:27:40,858
...even at risk to yourself.

314
00:27:42,358 --> 00:27:45,157
Do you think you made the right
decision?

315
00:27:45,457 --> 00:27:47,457
Or do you think you fucked up?

316
00:27:49,557 --> 00:27:53,356
Given what I knew at the time,
I made the right decision.

317
00:27:55,756 --> 00:27:59,856
So you still believe in confidentiality.

318
00:28:00,356 --> 00:28:03,756
Within legal limits.
What exactly are you concerned with?

319
00:28:10,555 --> 00:28:14,755
If I told you
that I killed Kevin Franks...

320
00:28:14,955 --> 00:28:17,654
...would you report me to the police?

321
00:28:20,554 --> 00:28:21,954
No.

322
00:28:22,154 --> 00:28:26,453
Anything that happened in the past,
I wouldn't discuss outside this room.

323
00:28:29,153 --> 00:28:32,853
But if you told me you were going to
murder someone specifically...

324
00:28:33,053 --> 00:28:35,353
...and I thought you were serious...

325
00:28:35,553 --> 00:28:37,953
...then, yes, I'd go to the police.

326
00:28:39,153 --> 00:28:43,352
I might be manipulating you
to create risk for myself.

327
00:28:46,952 --> 00:28:49,751
Do you want to talk about
what happened to Kevin?

328
00:28:54,051 --> 00:28:55,751
No, not really.

329
00:28:55,951 --> 00:28:58,850
I was just checking your policy.

330
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:02,850
So have you decided?

331
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:07,050
About taking me on as a patient.

332
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:14,749
<i>Shooter had an ex-wife,
a drinking problem...</i>

333
00:29:14,949 --> 00:29:18,849
<i>... a drug problem, a complicated sex
problem he was barely aware of.</i>

334
00:29:19,049 --> 00:29:21,949
<i>And a tremendous amount of
free-floating rage.</i>

335
00:29:22,148 --> 00:29:26,148
<i>In short, he was a cop
and a very good one.</i>

336
00:29:26,448 --> 00:29:27,448
<i>On March 3rd...</i>

337
00:29:27,748 --> 00:29:30,248
<i>The woman knelt naked
at the foot of the bed.</i>

338
00:29:30,447 --> 00:29:32,647
<i>Her back to him, her head on a pillow.</i>

339
00:29:32,847 --> 00:29:37,247
<i>Shooter raked his fingers through her
blond hair and twisted it tight.</i>

340
00:29:37,447 --> 00:29:39,547
<i>She groaned, her breath catching...</i>

341
00:29:39,747 --> 00:29:43,947
<i>... as he suddenly yanked her hair like
a rider pulling on a horse's mane.</i>

342
00:29:44,147 --> 00:29:48,746
<i>The veins on his arms bulged as
he roughly drew her onto him.</i>

343
00:29:50,946 --> 00:29:53,546
<i>Do you remember
that cop Washburn?</i>

344
00:29:53,946 --> 00:29:59,145
To him, the fact that I wasn't upset
about Kevin Franks...

345
00:29:59,345 --> 00:30:02,145
...was proof that I must've killed him.

346
00:30:03,844 --> 00:30:06,944
Then, when I wouldn't break down...

347
00:30:07,144 --> 00:30:09,244
...he hit on me.

348
00:30:11,144 --> 00:30:12,444
Hit on you?

349
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:13,744
Yeah.

350
00:30:13,944 --> 00:30:17,344
He said that if I fucked him things
would go easier.

351
00:30:18,544 --> 00:30:21,443
Homicide cops
are usually smarter than that.

352
00:30:22,943 --> 00:30:26,843
I knew one once, in San Francisco.

353
00:30:28,542 --> 00:30:30,442
Nick Curran.

354
00:30:30,642 --> 00:30:32,642
They called him Shooter.

355
00:30:32,942 --> 00:30:36,241
We used to get in his car
and ride around...

356
00:30:36,441 --> 00:30:39,641
...listening to 911 calls on his
scanner...

357
00:30:39,841 --> 00:30:41,541
...then speed over.

358
00:30:41,741 --> 00:30:45,341
Have you ever been to a murder scene
right after it happened?

359
00:30:49,341 --> 00:30:51,741
The body's still warm.

360
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:55,540
The watch is still ticking.

361
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:58,740
You can smell the blood.

362
00:31:00,639 --> 00:31:03,439
We'd hang around
for a while and then...

363
00:31:03,639 --> 00:31:06,139
...go have sex in Nick's car.

364
00:31:11,338 --> 00:31:13,238
Nick used to say:

365
00:31:13,438 --> 00:31:18,938
"Death is always there.
It's the only thing that's real."

366
00:31:19,138 --> 00:31:22,238
Except maybe sex sometimes.

367
00:31:22,438 --> 00:31:25,037
But only sometimes?

368
00:31:25,237 --> 00:31:27,037
Well...

369
00:31:27,437 --> 00:31:30,637
...I fucked this guy last night.

370
00:31:30,837 --> 00:31:32,936
I fucked him for hours.

371
00:31:33,136 --> 00:31:35,936
You know,
we did everything to each other.

372
00:31:37,236 --> 00:31:42,535
The full screaming Masters
and Johnson's greatest hits.

373
00:31:43,035 --> 00:31:48,535
But you know, a week from now,
I probably won't even remember him.

374
00:31:48,735 --> 00:31:52,535
But, if I was with him when he died...

375
00:31:55,135 --> 00:31:56,335
Now...

376
00:31:57,734 --> 00:32:02,634
...I probably would never forget that.

377
00:32:04,734 --> 00:32:05,933
Would I?

378
00:32:07,633 --> 00:32:10,233
Were you ever with anyone
when they died?

379
00:32:14,632 --> 00:32:15,632
No.

380
00:32:17,632 --> 00:32:19,032
Christ.

381
00:32:24,232 --> 00:32:26,132
We still have 20 minutes left.

382
00:32:26,332 --> 00:32:28,532
I feel like a cigarette.

383
00:32:28,732 --> 00:32:30,431
See you tomorrow.

384
00:32:31,531 --> 00:32:32,831
<i>She just walked out?</i>

385
00:32:34,931 --> 00:32:36,031
How Lacanian.

386
00:32:36,231 --> 00:32:38,031
For her, time's a weapon.

387
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:41,230
Everything's a weapon.
Everybody's an enemy.

388
00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:46,429
Do you think she made it up about
the policeman? Washburn?

389
00:32:46,629 --> 00:32:50,229
I don't know. It's so hard to believe
anything she says.

390
00:32:50,429 --> 00:32:52,229
She's trying to seduce you.

391
00:32:52,429 --> 00:32:54,429
They always try to seduce you.

392
00:32:54,629 --> 00:32:57,329
Yes, but this one's different, isn't it?

393
00:32:58,629 --> 00:33:01,429
I don't know. More fun maybe.

394
00:33:01,629 --> 00:33:03,628
Be careful, Michael.

395
00:33:06,528 --> 00:33:10,028
By the way, I got a call from that
reporter, Adam Towers.

396
00:33:11,427 --> 00:33:12,527
What did he want?

397
00:33:12,727 --> 00:33:16,427
I made everything sound boring.
I assured him he didn't have a story.

398
00:33:16,627 --> 00:33:19,326
What if he calls others?
What if he calls Gerst?

399
00:33:19,526 --> 00:33:23,626
Gerst won't talk to a popular magazine
reporter. Are you kidding?

400
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:40,725
Anyway, it was a successful paper.

401
00:33:40,925 --> 00:33:43,624
Published, on this occasion,
under sole authorship.

402
00:33:43,824 --> 00:33:45,524
Well, thank God for that.

403
00:33:45,724 --> 00:33:47,824
Speaking of God, is Gerst coming?

404
00:33:48,024 --> 00:33:50,024
We can only hope and pray.

405
00:33:50,224 --> 00:33:52,423
That he comes or he doesn't?

406
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:58,423
I'm going for a smoke. Don't talk about
anything interesting till I get back.

407
00:33:59,923 --> 00:34:01,523
How long have you lived here?

408
00:34:01,723 --> 00:34:05,323
About six years, something like that.
Seven.

409
00:34:15,522 --> 00:34:16,521
Hi, Dominic.

410
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:17,921
Hi, Milena.

411
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:27,120
Thank you.

412
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:32,420
The beauty about
antisocial behavior...

413
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:36,120
...is that it takes you away from other
people, however briefly.

414
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:39,920
You're not an analyst.

415
00:34:42,319 --> 00:34:43,719
I'm a writer.

416
00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:46,319
Really? What do you write about?

417
00:34:46,519 --> 00:34:50,618
Oh, the lurid, the sexual, the violent.

418
00:34:50,818 --> 00:34:52,518
The basic instincts.

419
00:34:53,518 --> 00:34:55,418
They're the most powerful,
aren't they?

420
00:35:07,817 --> 00:35:09,017
Milena.

421
00:35:09,217 --> 00:35:10,517
Oh, Michael.

422
00:35:10,717 --> 00:35:13,217
I'm sorry, I didn't ask your name.

423
00:35:13,416 --> 00:35:16,516
Catherine Tramell. Milena Gardosh.

424
00:35:17,616 --> 00:35:20,116
Oh, you're Dr. Gardosh.

425
00:35:20,316 --> 00:35:23,415
I've heard so many wonderful things
about you.

426
00:35:23,615 --> 00:35:24,915
Catherine.

427
00:35:26,115 --> 00:35:27,515
There you are.

428
00:35:30,314 --> 00:35:34,014
Milena, Dr. Glass.
I see you've met Catherine.

429
00:35:34,214 --> 00:35:38,614
She's doing research for a novel about
an eminent psychoanalyst.

430
00:35:38,914 --> 00:35:41,814
I thought she might enjoy an occasion
like this.

431
00:35:44,514 --> 00:35:46,413
Well, may I take your coats?

432
00:35:47,913 --> 00:35:49,613
Thank you.

433
00:35:49,813 --> 00:35:51,113
Excuse me.

434
00:35:53,613 --> 00:35:56,012
Would you put that in my pocket?

435
00:35:57,712 --> 00:35:58,712
Certainly.

436
00:36:00,612 --> 00:36:03,011
Catherine, come this way.

437
00:36:04,411 --> 00:36:08,411
What's going on? What was Gerst
thinking of, bringing her here?

438
00:36:08,611 --> 00:36:11,011
I'm sure he's no idea who she is.

439
00:36:11,211 --> 00:36:13,011
Where did he meet her?

440
00:36:13,211 --> 00:36:15,411
She would have met him, believe me.

441
00:36:16,511 --> 00:36:20,110
I can't stay here while I've got
a patient here. I have to go.

442
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:21,510
I understand.

443
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:27,009
If you follow inter-subjectivity to its
natural end...

444
00:36:27,209 --> 00:36:30,409
...aren't you asking who's the patient
and who's the doctor?

445
00:36:30,609 --> 00:36:32,409
Those were my very words.

446
00:36:32,609 --> 00:36:33,909
Very good.

447
00:36:35,108 --> 00:36:37,608
Note that one for future reference.

448
00:36:47,008 --> 00:36:49,208
Are you leaving because of me?

449
00:36:52,707 --> 00:36:54,607
You must have known I'd be here.

450
00:36:54,807 --> 00:36:56,607
Is that a problem?

451
00:36:56,807 --> 00:37:00,006
I know some people who play tennis
with their shrinks.

452
00:37:00,206 --> 00:37:01,606
I'm sure you do.

453
00:37:01,806 --> 00:37:05,906
Have sex with them. Sell them drugs.
Work on their screenplays.

454
00:37:06,106 --> 00:37:07,606
But I don't do that.

455
00:37:08,905 --> 00:37:12,605
I was upset about our session today.

456
00:37:12,805 --> 00:37:15,805
I felt I owed you an apology.

457
00:37:16,205 --> 00:37:18,205
That's why I came.

458
00:37:19,805 --> 00:37:21,905
We can go into that tomorrow.

459
00:37:22,405 --> 00:37:24,404
I've got a better idea.

460
00:37:24,604 --> 00:37:28,704
How about I ditch everybody
and we go somewhere for a drink.

461
00:37:29,104 --> 00:37:32,703
I told you, I don't socialize with my
patients.

462
00:37:33,203 --> 00:37:35,503
Another one of your rules?

463
00:37:35,703 --> 00:37:38,103
Don't you get kind of tired of them?

464
00:37:38,303 --> 00:37:41,602
You know, that's the nightmare
of shrinkdom, doctor.

465
00:37:41,802 --> 00:37:44,502
Too many answers,
too many questions...

466
00:37:44,702 --> 00:37:46,202
...nobody gets laid.

467
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:54,402
Okay, forget getting laid.

468
00:37:56,602 --> 00:37:58,101
We'll just talk.

469
00:37:59,401 --> 00:38:01,401
We'll talk tomorrow.

470
00:38:20,299 --> 00:38:22,899
Michael. There you are.

471
00:38:23,099 --> 00:38:27,499
Oh, my God. Did you see that woman
that Gerst brought with him?

472
00:38:27,699 --> 00:38:28,999
No.

473
00:38:29,199 --> 00:38:31,798
Actually, I was just looking for you.

474
00:38:33,098 --> 00:38:34,298
What, in there?

475
00:38:34,498 --> 00:38:37,498
I was looking for your coat.
I thought we could go for a drink.

476
00:38:37,697 --> 00:38:38,597
If that's all right?

477
00:38:41,697 --> 00:38:43,497
Yeah. Great.

478
00:39:24,893 --> 00:39:26,593
What's wrong?

479
00:39:26,793 --> 00:39:27,993
Turn around.

480
00:39:28,193 --> 00:39:29,193
What?

481
00:39:29,393 --> 00:39:30,693
Turn around.

482
00:40:12,589 --> 00:40:13,789
Oh, God!

483
00:40:14,989 --> 00:40:19,088
<i>Michael, it's Denise!
Please pick up the phone! Please!</i>

484
00:40:19,288 --> 00:40:21,688
<i>Michael, please pick up the phone!</i>

485
00:40:21,888 --> 00:40:23,288
Denise?

486
00:40:23,787 --> 00:40:25,987
Hey, hey, hey. What's happened?

487
00:40:41,186 --> 00:40:42,986
Thanks, guv.

488
00:40:47,186 --> 00:40:49,185
Come in, Michael.

489
00:40:49,385 --> 00:40:50,985
Hey, you okay?

490
00:40:53,585 --> 00:40:55,385
Hey, what's going on?

491
00:40:55,585 --> 00:40:58,084
It's okay, I'm here now. Okay?

492
00:40:58,284 --> 00:40:59,684
Who lives here?

493
00:40:59,884 --> 00:41:01,684
It's Adam's place.

494
00:41:38,781 --> 00:41:39,881
Jesus.

495
00:41:40,481 --> 00:41:42,181
What happened?

496
00:41:42,381 --> 00:41:47,080
I don't know. The door was unlocked
and I just came in.

497
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:49,280
I just saw him lying there.

498
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:53,679
Have you called the police?

499
00:41:53,879 --> 00:41:55,779
No. I was afraid.

500
00:42:44,475 --> 00:42:46,275
Hello, Michael.

501
00:42:46,475 --> 00:42:48,375
What are you doing here?

502
00:42:48,575 --> 00:42:50,775
It's my wife. Well, my ex-wife.

503
00:42:50,974 --> 00:42:53,774
She found him like that,
then she called me.

504
00:43:00,173 --> 00:43:01,373
I see.

505
00:43:01,573 --> 00:43:05,573
And how did she happen to
find him like that?

506
00:43:06,673 --> 00:43:09,372
They'd been seeing each other and...

507
00:43:11,772 --> 00:43:13,172
Oh, really?

508
00:43:13,372 --> 00:43:14,972
Since when?

509
00:43:16,372 --> 00:43:18,172
It's why I moved out.

510
00:43:19,672 --> 00:43:23,372
So I assume you weren't
the best of friends?

511
00:43:23,571 --> 00:43:24,571
No.

512
00:43:27,071 --> 00:43:30,071
Yet I saw you talking to him
after the Tramell hearing.

513
00:43:30,271 --> 00:43:31,970
It was just journalist stuff.

514
00:43:32,170 --> 00:43:34,970
He was asking me questions about
Tramell.

515
00:43:35,170 --> 00:43:37,070
Do you think she killed him?

516
00:43:38,670 --> 00:43:39,770
Who?

517
00:43:42,969 --> 00:43:44,769
Denise? No.

518
00:43:44,969 --> 00:43:47,069
No, not a chance.

519
00:43:47,269 --> 00:43:50,769
I've known her for a long time.
She could never do anything like that.

520
00:43:52,869 --> 00:43:56,968
Listen, Roy, I've told my story twice
over. Is it all right if I go home?

521
00:43:58,668 --> 00:43:59,768
All right.

522
00:44:02,368 --> 00:44:03,868
Oh, by the way...

523
00:44:06,667 --> 00:44:07,867
...this yours?

524
00:44:11,367 --> 00:44:14,366
No, I just found it on the floor.

525
00:44:15,866 --> 00:44:18,166
How did it end up in the rubbish?

526
00:44:18,566 --> 00:44:22,866
I stepped on it. It was leaking.
I just threw it away.

527
00:44:26,366 --> 00:44:27,766
Can I go?

528
00:44:31,465 --> 00:44:33,165
Yes, by all means.

529
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:39,959
I assume you know Adam Towers
was killed.

530
00:45:41,459 --> 00:45:43,058
Why would I know?

531
00:45:43,458 --> 00:45:46,058
Because of Denise.

532
00:45:46,258 --> 00:45:47,558
Denise?

533
00:45:47,758 --> 00:45:49,258
Your wife. Your ex-wife.

534
00:45:49,458 --> 00:45:51,857
I know who she is.
How do you know her?

535
00:45:52,357 --> 00:45:55,557
Adam introduced us a couple of times.

536
00:45:55,757 --> 00:45:59,757
It was all very open. I knew about her,
she knew about me.

537
00:45:59,957 --> 00:46:01,457
Knew what about you?

538
00:46:04,657 --> 00:46:06,757
That I was seeing him too.

539
00:46:07,956 --> 00:46:10,556
The Masters and Johnson guy.
That was him.

540
00:46:10,756 --> 00:46:13,856
So... You were sleeping
with Adam Towers?

541
00:46:14,356 --> 00:46:16,255
Occasionally.

542
00:46:19,555 --> 00:46:21,955
So, of course,
Washburn thinks I killed him.

543
00:46:22,155 --> 00:46:23,754
Why would he think that?

544
00:46:25,154 --> 00:46:30,154
I kill because I'm addicted to risk.
Or to prove that I exist.

545
00:46:30,354 --> 00:46:31,754
I'm not sure which one it is.

546
00:46:31,954 --> 00:46:33,954
I never said you killed anybody.

547
00:46:34,154 --> 00:46:35,454
But you think I did.

548
00:46:35,654 --> 00:46:40,453
You think I killed Kevin, and now
you're wondering if I killed Adam.

549
00:46:40,653 --> 00:46:44,353
Why don't you just ask me?
Or is that too direct for you?

550
00:46:46,853 --> 00:46:48,352
Did you kill him?

551
00:46:49,352 --> 00:46:52,652
If I said I didn't,
would you believe me?

552
00:46:56,251 --> 00:46:57,251
Depends.

553
00:46:57,751 --> 00:47:01,451
On what?
The quality of my performance?

554
00:47:01,651 --> 00:47:05,451
You know what?
I'm glad Adam Towers is dead.

555
00:47:05,651 --> 00:47:07,351
And you should be glad too.

556
00:47:07,551 --> 00:47:10,351
If you're too uptight,
I'll be glad for you.

557
00:47:10,551 --> 00:47:12,650
Whoever killed him did you a favor.

558
00:47:12,950 --> 00:47:14,050
Favor?

559
00:47:14,350 --> 00:47:18,650
If he'd written that article on Cheslav,
it would've ruined your career.

560
00:47:19,050 --> 00:47:22,049
You haven't told me if you killed him.
Can you put that out?

561
00:47:25,149 --> 00:47:28,149
Put it out now or you can leave,
okay?!

562
00:47:35,348 --> 00:47:36,748
Is that better?

563
00:48:15,745 --> 00:48:19,644
When you think about fucking me...

564
00:48:19,844 --> 00:48:22,244
...and I know you do...

565
00:48:22,444 --> 00:48:26,143
...how do you picture it, doctor?

566
00:48:28,743 --> 00:48:32,843
Oh, I know you can't answer me,
so just think it.

567
00:48:34,042 --> 00:48:35,842
Do you want it straight up?

568
00:48:36,042 --> 00:48:37,542
You on top?

569
00:48:37,742 --> 00:48:39,142
Me on top?

570
00:48:40,942 --> 00:48:43,642
Do you want it from behind...

571
00:48:46,542 --> 00:48:50,441
...on your knees,
my face in the pillow?

572
00:48:51,741 --> 00:48:54,541
Do you want to beat me up...

573
00:48:55,041 --> 00:48:57,241
...just a little?

574
00:48:57,441 --> 00:48:59,440
Not too hard.

575
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:04,140
Oh, a little harder than that.

576
00:49:07,239 --> 00:49:09,939
Do you want to come in my mouth?

577
00:49:12,739 --> 00:49:17,939
What if I told you that I masturbate
thinking about you?

578
00:49:19,339 --> 00:49:21,439
That I make myself come...

579
00:49:21,639 --> 00:49:25,838
...thinking about you
making yourself come.

580
00:49:36,337 --> 00:49:38,737
I guess we're out of time for today.

581
00:49:49,436 --> 00:49:51,336
I'm terminating therapy.

582
00:49:51,536 --> 00:49:53,136
Send me the bill.

583
00:50:37,631 --> 00:50:40,031
Are you feeling all right?

584
00:51:09,228 --> 00:51:11,128
Miss Tramell, it's Dr. Glass here.

585
00:51:11,828 --> 00:51:15,028
Listen, I'm concerned about how our
session ended today.

586
00:51:15,228 --> 00:51:17,927
I'd like to talk through
any misunderstandings...

587
00:51:18,127 --> 00:51:20,227
...there might be between us.

588
00:51:20,427 --> 00:51:23,527
As soon as you get this message,
please give me a...

589
00:51:24,827 --> 00:51:27,027
Just call me when you can.

590
00:51:27,227 --> 00:51:29,027
Evening, Dr. Glass.

591
00:51:30,127 --> 00:51:31,727
Could I have a word?

592
00:51:31,927 --> 00:51:33,826
Sure. Upstairs.

593
00:51:38,726 --> 00:51:40,426
Is that German?

594
00:51:40,626 --> 00:51:42,125
Can I get you anything?

595
00:51:42,325 --> 00:51:43,525
No.

596
00:51:43,725 --> 00:51:45,625
So here's a surprise.

597
00:51:45,825 --> 00:51:50,224
Adam Towers had a girlfriend
besides Denise.

598
00:51:50,424 --> 00:51:51,724
Guess who.

599
00:51:53,124 --> 00:51:54,924
Catherine Tramell.

600
00:51:56,324 --> 00:51:57,624
You don't look surprised.

601
00:51:57,824 --> 00:51:59,824
She's a private patient of mine.

602
00:52:00,024 --> 00:52:01,424
I see. Since when?

603
00:52:01,624 --> 00:52:02,724
Not long.

604
00:52:03,924 --> 00:52:08,623
So your ex and your private patient
were both screwing Adam Towers.

605
00:52:08,823 --> 00:52:12,023
That's quite a coincidence.
Did they know each other?

606
00:52:12,223 --> 00:52:14,722
I don't know. I don't think so.
Did you...?

607
00:52:17,322 --> 00:52:22,522
Tramell's prints were all over Towers'
apartment, along with others.

608
00:52:22,721 --> 00:52:26,921
But what's interesting is the last call
he made was to her mobile phone...

609
00:52:27,121 --> 00:52:29,221
...90 minutes before he died.

610
00:52:29,421 --> 00:52:31,721
Her story is she was out walking all
that time.

611
00:52:31,921 --> 00:52:35,721
Two hours strolling around Clerkenwell
and nobody saw her, so...

612
00:52:35,921 --> 00:52:38,821
Come on, Michael. Talk to me.

613
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:43,820
I can't tell you anything. Even if I
knew something, which I don't.

614
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:49,319
Franks was first. Towers second.
There's bound to be a third.

615
00:52:49,619 --> 00:52:51,319
This goes beyond confidentiality.

616
00:52:51,519 --> 00:52:55,119
You've got a legal obligation to protect
a potential victim.

617
00:52:55,318 --> 00:52:59,318
You can't lock somebody up because
you think they might do something.

618
00:52:59,518 --> 00:53:02,918
Why don't you tell me what you know
about this article...

619
00:53:03,118 --> 00:53:06,618
...Towers was writing about you
and our old friend George Cheslav.

620
00:53:09,018 --> 00:53:11,218
Who told you
he was writing an article?

621
00:53:11,518 --> 00:53:12,717
His editor.

622
00:53:12,917 --> 00:53:16,017
He'd been very busy.
He had a lot of information on you.

623
00:53:17,817 --> 00:53:19,517
What, and you think I killed him...

624
00:53:19,717 --> 00:53:22,016
...to stop him writing
some stupid article?

625
00:53:22,616 --> 00:53:28,015
No. But just for the record, why don't
you tell me how you spent last night.

626
00:53:28,215 --> 00:53:31,115
Between, say,
7 p.m. And 2 in the morning.

627
00:53:31,315 --> 00:53:33,815
You know, broad strokes.

628
00:53:36,415 --> 00:53:38,715
I had patients until 8 p.m.

629
00:53:38,915 --> 00:53:41,015
Then went to a party
in Collingham Gardens.

630
00:53:41,215 --> 00:53:43,015
I left there about 11 with a woman.

631
00:53:43,215 --> 00:53:46,914
We came here and I was on my knees
fucking her when Denise called.

632
00:53:51,314 --> 00:53:53,013
On your knees, eh?

633
00:53:54,213 --> 00:53:57,313
Sounds like your evening
was better than mine.

634
00:53:57,513 --> 00:54:01,612
Could I get her name?
So there are no loose ends.

635
00:54:03,912 --> 00:54:07,612
Look, Michael, Adam Towers
was fucking your ex-wife...

636
00:54:07,812 --> 00:54:12,112
...and about to do the same
to your career. I've got to ask.

637
00:54:17,011 --> 00:54:18,511
Michelle Broadwin.

638
00:54:20,111 --> 00:54:24,611
She's a psycho-pharmacologist at
Victoria Psychiatric Hospital.

639
00:54:27,910 --> 00:54:29,010
Thank you.

640
00:54:31,410 --> 00:54:32,910
I'll be in touch.

641
00:54:38,109 --> 00:54:39,209
What does that mean?

642
00:54:43,109 --> 00:54:44,709
I smell blood.

643
00:54:59,707 --> 00:55:04,707
Yeah, not all of them, of course, but,
you know, some of them.

644
00:55:05,007 --> 00:55:08,806
They're all so sanctimonious...

645
00:55:09,006 --> 00:55:11,206
...so judgmental.

646
00:55:11,406 --> 00:55:16,906
All my friends, they drink too much.
They snort too much coke.

647
00:55:17,106 --> 00:55:19,506
<i>Miss Tramell,
it's Dr. Glass here again.</i>

648
00:55:19,706 --> 00:55:22,505
I'm a little concerned
I haven't heard from you.

649
00:55:22,705 --> 00:55:25,005
I was wondering whether you're okay.

650
00:55:25,205 --> 00:55:29,205
Look, let me give you
my home number. It's 0207...

651
00:55:29,405 --> 00:55:33,704
Sorry, it really got to me and I don't
know why it seems to be doing that.

652
00:55:33,904 --> 00:55:38,104
Why it's getting worse.
I mean, I was really excited.

653
00:55:38,304 --> 00:55:41,303
<i>You have no new messages.</i>

654
00:56:08,601 --> 00:56:10,501
The thing about Gerst is this:

655
00:56:10,701 --> 00:56:13,500
The selection committee
is just a formality.

656
00:56:13,700 --> 00:56:15,600
This is the real interview.

657
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:19,100
Relax.

658
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:22,300
Be direct, candid.

659
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:24,900
But not too candid.

660
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:30,899
Very good time. They always get lost
on the way. Come in.

661
00:56:31,099 --> 00:56:32,899
Meet my new Mughal painting.

662
00:56:33,099 --> 00:56:34,899
Not another one.

663
00:56:35,099 --> 00:56:39,298
An Indian goddess at peace. It has a
tranquility to it, don't you think?

664
00:56:39,998 --> 00:56:43,898
I wonder what the males are doing,
loitering so close to her?

665
00:56:44,097 --> 00:56:47,497
It's obvious. They're worshiping her.

666
00:56:47,797 --> 00:56:48,997
As they should.

667
00:56:49,397 --> 00:56:52,897
Perhaps that's why she has eight arms
to fend them off.

668
00:56:53,097 --> 00:56:57,397
Why don't you girls go outside
while Dr. Glass and I have our chat.

669
00:56:58,897 --> 00:57:01,096
Come. Come.

670
00:57:01,696 --> 00:57:04,696
Come with me. You'll enjoy it.

671
00:57:09,095 --> 00:57:12,095
So, Dr. Glass, I have a question:

672
00:57:12,495 --> 00:57:14,295
Do you think I'm insane?

673
00:57:16,095 --> 00:57:16,994
Pardon?

674
00:57:17,594 --> 00:57:19,794
Nuts? Bonkers? Off my trolley?

675
00:57:20,594 --> 00:57:22,294
No, not at all.

676
00:57:22,794 --> 00:57:26,094
But I might be if I recommended you
for the Douglas Chair.

677
00:57:28,494 --> 00:57:29,794
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

678
00:57:30,494 --> 00:57:32,394
George Cheslav.

679
00:57:33,093 --> 00:57:38,193
A major drug dealer, under your care,
brutally murders his girlfriend.

680
00:57:38,393 --> 00:57:40,493
An inquiry is held...

681
00:57:40,693 --> 00:57:44,492
...where Detective Roy Washburn...

682
00:57:44,692 --> 00:57:47,992
...testifies that you acted
professionally at all times.

683
00:57:48,192 --> 00:57:49,192
You're blameless.

684
00:57:49,391 --> 00:57:50,491
That's right, I was.

685
00:57:51,491 --> 00:57:55,191
However, after the trial...

686
00:57:55,391 --> 00:57:59,191
...you experienced what we might term
an emotional meltdown:

687
00:57:59,391 --> 00:58:00,691
Depression...

688
00:58:00,891 --> 00:58:03,091
...occupational underachievement...

689
00:58:03,291 --> 00:58:04,891
...marital problems...

690
00:58:05,091 --> 00:58:08,590
...and questionable professional
conduct...

691
00:58:08,790 --> 00:58:12,690
...much discussed at dinner parties
around our great city.

692
00:58:15,089 --> 00:58:16,089
I'm sorry?

693
00:58:17,489 --> 00:58:20,189
Now you want my support
for the Douglas Chair.

694
00:58:25,288 --> 00:58:27,488
No more Cheslavs, Michael.

695
00:58:30,488 --> 00:58:31,688
No.

696
00:58:37,888 --> 00:58:39,687
No more Cheslavs.

697
01:00:19,978 --> 01:00:21,078
Catherine!

698
01:00:31,077 --> 01:00:31,577
Catherine!

699
01:00:35,076 --> 01:00:38,476
Sorry. All right.
Sorry, I'm just looking for someone.

700
01:01:54,270 --> 01:01:56,569
God, Michael, how dramatic.

701
01:01:56,769 --> 01:01:57,669
I know.

702
01:01:57,869 --> 01:02:01,669
I thought she was in danger,
but I know that's not the point.

703
01:02:01,869 --> 01:02:03,968
She could be a murderer twice over...

704
01:02:04,168 --> 01:02:07,668
...and you're acting like she's a
princess you have to rescue.

705
01:02:07,968 --> 01:02:10,168
Don't patronize me, please.

706
01:02:11,967 --> 01:02:13,967
It's driving me crazy.

707
01:02:16,167 --> 01:02:18,467
You're in love with her, aren't you?

708
01:02:20,067 --> 01:02:21,867
Not love. It's...

709
01:02:24,167 --> 01:02:25,567
I don't know.

710
01:02:30,166 --> 01:02:33,366
You have to terminate this therapy,
right away.
