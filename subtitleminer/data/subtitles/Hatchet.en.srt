00:00:54,021 --> 00:00:55,990
Go Paul there, we are here at the 3 hours,

2
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,524
and nor we know where was.

3
00:00:58,265 --> 00:01:03,184
He/she has at least two meters and twenty.
I never saw a like this!

4
00:01:05,335 --> 00:01:07,949
I don't leave of here without her

5
00:01:10,128 --> 00:01:12,138
I am cold!

6
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:15,329
He/she closes the rattle.

7
00:01:35,174 --> 00:01:38,019
Do go there mine, can we lean?
I have to give a mijadela.

8
00:01:38,147 --> 00:01:41,205
- He/she urinates there in front of the boat.
- Go there!

9
00:01:41,417 --> 00:01:42,809
She won't bite.

10
00:01:44,226 --> 00:01:45,524
Shit!

11
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:52,731
Jesus Cristo.

12
00:02:01,167 --> 00:02:04,629
- Go there mine, I am not like this capable.
- And because not?

13
00:02:04,664 --> 00:02:07,434
Because it is eccentric
with you there seating.

14
00:02:07,547 --> 00:02:09,280
He/she speaks quietly!

15
00:02:09,291 --> 00:02:12,649
He/she doesn't import what I say.
It silences you Ainsley. You are maricas Ainsley.

16
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:14,954
Because you are not more similar
with your sister Ainsley?

17
00:02:14,967 --> 00:02:17,753
- I said caluda, maricas!
- You see!?

18
00:02:18,868 --> 00:02:20,270
Are you to see?

19
00:02:22,506 --> 00:02:23,742
Stupid.

20
00:02:25,544 --> 00:02:26,813
What did boy say?

21
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:28,913
Anything.

22
00:02:29,251 --> 00:02:31,610
Don't make to throw you to me to the swamp.

23
00:02:34,123 --> 00:02:35,118
He/she prays there is...

24
00:02:36,122 --> 00:02:37,581
Jesus Cristo!!

25
00:02:38,027 --> 00:02:41,479
- What did happen he/she?
- She wanted to eat me the balls!

26
00:02:47,801 --> 00:02:49,762
You scared her, stupid!

27
00:02:50,442 --> 00:02:52,378
What did want him to do?

28
00:02:53,446 --> 00:02:57,137
Porra. We can lean for
I to finish my mijadela?

29
00:03:07,313 --> 00:03:08,611
He/she dispatches you.

30
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:15,251
Cursed maricas,
he/she needs to urinate stooping.

31
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:29,529
Shit.

32
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:38,498
He/she is quiet, Ainsley.

33
00:03:39,538 --> 00:03:40,930
I think she returned.

34
00:03:42,173 --> 00:03:43,938
What should make?

35
00:03:44,342 --> 00:03:47,700
Don't make noise, it is there.

36
00:04:00,326 --> 00:04:01,343
Paul?

37
00:04:02,985 --> 00:04:04,451
Did you pick her?

38
00:04:10,155 --> 00:04:11,352
Paul?!

39
00:04:13,491 --> 00:04:15,532
And if we went home now?

40
00:04:25,197 --> 00:04:26,392
Father?

41
00:04:27,955 --> 00:04:29,137
Paul?

42
00:04:36,353 --> 00:04:37,529
Paul.

43
00:04:54,005 --> 00:04:55,298
Do let us go?!

44
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:58,341
He/she walks to pick me, mijao.

45
00:05:01,612 --> 00:05:02,946
I kill you.

46
00:05:25,455 --> 00:05:28,020
God, helps me!!

47
00:05:30,228 --> 00:05:34,120
<b > VERSION NO CENSURED < /b>

48
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:18,862
I eat a bee.

49
00:08:20,293 --> 00:08:23,693
He/she raises, mine.
That is Mardi Gras, is entertaining.

50
00:08:23,737 --> 00:08:24,902
A madness!?

51
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:27,301
Here, here... look.

52
00:08:27,753 --> 00:08:29,653
He/she looks at those mammas there.

53
00:08:31,122 --> 00:08:32,220
Hi.

54
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:33,928
Something new, it is not?

55
00:08:34,532 --> 00:08:36,232
Didn't you still see mammas that arrive?

56
00:08:38,536 --> 00:08:41,629
I am not to feel this.
He/she should have stayed home.

57
00:08:41,658 --> 00:08:44,129
What for? For you be in yours
room and to cry for Heather?

58
00:08:44,164 --> 00:08:45,464
Kristine.

59
00:08:45,714 --> 00:08:49,577
Mine, we came here to tan.
And you are to hinder the things.

60
00:08:49,591 --> 00:08:52,426
There is amusement on the whole side.
Does he/she stop being cuts?

61
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:55,183
How is it that that is entertaining?
This ranch is disgusting.

62
00:08:55,184 --> 00:08:58,577
Our room in the hotel
he/she smells to sweated tomatoes, mine.

63
00:08:58,932 --> 00:09:01,759
All are drunk
and to madden. You...

64
00:09:01,802 --> 00:09:04,820
...you vomited six times yesterday.
How is it that you managed to do that?

65
00:09:04,855 --> 00:09:08,254
You can be to tan.
I will find something to do.

66
00:09:08,289 --> 00:09:09,631
The something, alone?

67
00:09:10,078 --> 00:09:12,736
Dewitt Robinson spoke to me in a
trip to the haunted swamp...

68
00:09:12,737 --> 00:09:15,250
...that you/they did last year.
They said that was incredible.

69
00:09:15,318 --> 00:09:18,167
Type lights to float
and other scenes in the water.

70
00:09:19,654 --> 00:09:20,943
You want to leave this everything...

71
00:09:20,972 --> 00:09:25,473
...for you will see lights in a swamp?
- You don't have to come with me, Marcus.

72
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:28,519
- We were at the hotel.
- Fasten.

73
00:09:38,885 --> 00:09:40,153
Ben, waits, he waits for my...

74
00:09:40,656 --> 00:09:43,637
- Marcus no, it goes there...
- No, I am going with you. Tásse well.

75
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:47,293
Thank you, mine.
Friend, you will see that it is worthwhile.

76
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:49,959
I think I prefer to skin
my sex.

77
00:09:54,815 --> 00:09:56,878
- Certain, is official.
- It is here.

78
00:09:56,879 --> 00:09:58,348
No longer there is small.

79
00:09:59,722 --> 00:10:02,454
- They are closed.
- They cannot be closed.

80
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:06,058
But they are really.
He/she says closed... and you continue to beat.

81
00:10:06,592 --> 00:10:08,619
Certain, that is a drought.

82
00:10:08,961 --> 00:10:10,724
It is not dry none.
It will be fastens.

83
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:13,262
- For you, because you are a drought.
- He/she silences you.

84
00:10:16,372 --> 00:10:17,694
What do want?

85
00:10:19,733 --> 00:10:22,278
We want to do the trip
to the haunted swamp.

86
00:10:22,313 --> 00:10:26,273
Me no longer I take trips at night.
It is not allowed me.

87
00:10:26,973 --> 00:10:30,935
But it is that... our friends counted-
us that you/they made a here last year.

88
00:10:30,974 --> 00:10:36,936
No longer I can take trips at night.
The insurance was very expensive...

89
00:10:36,971 --> 00:10:39,141
...after what it happened.

90
00:10:40,156 --> 00:10:41,854
- It is feather! Let us go.
- He/she waits...

91
00:10:44,061 --> 00:10:45,195
What did happen he/she?

92
00:10:47,096 --> 00:10:49,129
You don't want to know.

93
00:10:49,465 --> 00:10:50,798
I do want.

94
00:10:51,372 --> 00:10:52,884
There we go us.

95
00:10:53,276 --> 00:10:57,614
I had a group,
outside in the swamp.

96
00:10:57,649 --> 00:11:01,881
In the last halloween,
he/she was a become overcast night...

97
00:11:02,695 --> 00:11:03,677
Yes?

98
00:11:03,678 --> 00:11:05,397
And there was a...

99
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:06,993
...of your color.

100
00:11:08,344 --> 00:11:11,056
He/she was afraid
with a thing in the margin.

101
00:11:12,241 --> 00:11:15,511
He/she saw two eyes to challenge him/it
of the forests.

102
00:11:16,548 --> 00:11:21,364
The children were fascinated.
He wanted to leave the boat to the hurry.

103
00:11:22,991 --> 00:11:26,704
And the foot, to hang for the cliff.

104
00:11:28,184 --> 00:11:30,537
- Did he fall?
- Did an aligátor pick him/it?

105
00:11:30,538 --> 00:11:32,709
- What did happen he/she?
- He slipped...

106
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:37,218
...and it beat with the head
in the skull of the boat.

107
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:40,804
And it processed me for negligence.

108
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:43,142
- That maricas!
- Only that?

109
00:11:44,244 --> 00:11:46,841
He/she tries in Marie Laveau.

110
00:11:47,881 --> 00:11:49,071
How?

111
00:11:49,072 --> 00:11:56,000
Two blocks above in the Rua Olive.
But she cannot know about me.

112
00:11:57,464 --> 00:12:00,761
I have go give food
to my birds.

113
00:12:03,342 --> 00:12:05,672
Care, walk in the walk!

114
00:12:10,634 --> 00:12:12,580
- Go mine, wait there.
- The something?

115
00:12:13,006 --> 00:12:17,860
Apposed what is the hell there, right?
Entertaining party... insane madness.

116
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:21,753
Wait Ben... that is grimace.

117
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,247
As it is that this is going you
to help to forget her?

118
00:12:23,248 --> 00:12:25,849
Marcus, that scene there behind, it is...

119
00:12:26,441 --> 00:12:30,647
All the sly ones good and nude middle that
I see, they make to remember Kristine.

120
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:35,265
He/she is probably to be hammered
by Bulkowski. In the room.

121
00:12:35,297 --> 00:12:38,140
Bent in that beige sofa,
that my mother bought him/her.

122
00:12:38,141 --> 00:12:40,817
What happened when dating
with a normal brute?

123
00:12:40,818 --> 00:12:42,446
That brute has a neck
of the size of a carrinha.

124
00:12:42,447 --> 00:12:44,779
And the colored flower in the ear,
it is strange.

125
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:46,656
The something? He will struggle with her
even á submission?

126
00:12:46,657 --> 00:12:48,426
- He/she is well, it stops, it stops...!
- He/she is well.

127
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:50,647
I don't want to think in Bulkowski
to eat your girlfriend.

128
00:12:50,648 --> 00:12:52,195
- Nor me.
- I already understood.

129
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:54,604
Go there mine, this will be entertaining.

130
00:12:58,556 --> 00:13:00,961
If no there is small in the swamp,
I won't need this.

131
00:13:00,962 --> 00:13:02,372
It will be entertaining.

132
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:05,336
- As entertaining as annoying.
- You there know.

133
00:13:05,338 --> 00:13:08,182
- That that is sanded used...
- You went there.

134
00:13:08,389 --> 00:13:10,513
I didn't know that her
he/she had insectos in the forest!

135
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:13,963
She started the night to scratch.
How is it that you didn't know?

136
00:13:13,965 --> 00:13:16,594
You cannot eat any a, Marcus.
Everyone knows about that.

137
00:13:16,595 --> 00:13:20,461
She said that was an allergy
in the fatty fabric, is it well?

138
00:13:20,462 --> 00:13:22,664
- I saw and I asked.
- Fatty fabric!?

139
00:13:22,699 --> 00:13:25,544
He/she looks at you shaver.
''Everyone knows about that.''

140
00:13:25,545 --> 00:13:27,482
When it was the last time
what did make sex?

141
00:13:30,531 --> 00:13:32,858
- I make sex the the whole hour...
- He/she silences you!

142
00:13:41,322 --> 00:13:42,228
Ladies.

143
00:13:58,873 --> 00:14:00,457
That is really entertaining.

144
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:03,551
That is good, good.

145
00:14:06,432 --> 00:14:07,774
Give a kiss.

146
00:14:10,847 --> 00:14:12,581
Yes, you adore.

147
00:14:13,124 --> 00:14:16,151
You want, you necessary.

148
00:14:17,706 --> 00:14:20,801
Rays. I have to change the battery.

149
00:14:21,297 --> 00:14:23,464
God, brushes the teeth
a lot of times!?

150
00:14:23,465 --> 00:14:24,692
It whips me, goat.

151
00:14:24,693 --> 00:14:27,219
No thank you, I like the
my language without the syphilis.

152
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:30,260
Your syphilis... Sra. expensive words?

153
00:14:30,261 --> 00:14:33,245
- That nor he/she makes sense.
- It whips me.

154
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,522
Misty, Jenna...

155
00:14:34,648 --> 00:14:36,934
They can understand each other for more
one hours, they are not able to?

156
00:14:36,935 --> 00:14:40,008
To tell the truth Doug.
I cannot work with this.

157
00:14:40,009 --> 00:14:43,913
I am a professional actriz.
I walked in U.N.Y.

158
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:46,567
Which is the joke?

159
00:14:46,568 --> 00:14:49,136
As if somebody already heard to speak of that.

160
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:52,137
- University of New York?
- I never heard to speak.

161
00:14:52,138 --> 00:14:53,244
Girls...

162
00:14:53,245 --> 00:14:55,327
Never nobody was discovered,
being done difficult.

163
00:14:55,815 --> 00:14:58,535
I need that show me
the love, right?

164
00:14:58,536 --> 00:15:00,926
Do I need the passion to feel, right?

165
00:15:01,304 --> 00:15:02,394
We are to film.

166
00:15:02,954 --> 00:15:04,328
I need to feel...

167
00:15:06,583 --> 00:15:08,529
Certain, they are sensual.

168
00:15:10,844 --> 00:15:12,294
Playful.

169
00:15:14,189 --> 00:15:15,855
They are curious.

170
00:15:17,947 --> 00:15:19,067
They are innocent.

171
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,931
Who is ready
for some terrors?

172
00:15:28,611 --> 00:15:30,879
The night soon will fall on us.

173
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,512
The spirits of the cursed ones
they are to raise.

174
00:15:33,513 --> 00:15:36,451
We will put our souls
in movement, my friends.

175
00:15:37,815 --> 00:15:39,958
What can make for you?

176
00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:42,121
Does he/she take the trip in the haunted swamp?

177
00:15:42,535 --> 00:15:45,640
I am the only that he/she takes the trip
in the haunted swamp.

178
00:15:46,338 --> 00:15:48,505
Live ghosts.

179
00:15:49,027 --> 00:15:50,855
Stories of the macabre.

180
00:15:50,856 --> 00:15:54,371
And ranches that are still
cursed for...

181
00:15:55,067 --> 00:15:56,533
...curses voodu.

182
00:15:56,755 --> 00:15:57,605
I don't like him!?

183
00:16:00,157 --> 00:16:03,099
We will leave now.
40 bones each.

184
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:04,269
40 dollars?

185
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:06,224
- Yes.
- He/she is well.

186
00:16:06,225 --> 00:16:08,735
- Do you sponsor me?
- Don't you have money?

187
00:16:08,736 --> 00:16:11,265
No, I won't only pay this treta.

188
00:16:13,732 --> 00:16:15,876
- Hello.
- Hi...

189
00:16:16,691 --> 00:16:17,779
How are they?

190
00:16:18,434 --> 00:16:20,375
How is it that go?!

191
00:16:24,393 --> 00:16:25,491
He/she is well.

192
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:29,546
Do you care that he/she sits down here?

193
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,445
Comfortable.

194
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:37,873
- Hello.
- Hi.

195
00:16:46,295 --> 00:16:48,229
Then me...

196
00:16:48,296 --> 00:16:49,847
I think am here.

197
00:17:04,076 --> 00:17:05,437
I am Ben.

198
00:17:06,007 --> 00:17:06,904
Marybeth.

199
00:17:07,467 --> 00:17:08,479
Marybeth?

200
00:17:09,117 --> 00:17:12,827
Good name, because they are two names.

201
00:17:13,696 --> 00:17:17,757
Most of the people
they only have a, and it is displeased type.

202
00:17:18,798 --> 00:17:19,896
Ben.

203
00:17:20,897 --> 00:17:22,549
But Marybeth, is...

204
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:26,589
Mary, and he/she is Beth.

205
00:17:26,590 --> 00:17:27,851
Beautiful coat.

206
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:36,361
Then you have animals of
estimate, or...

207
00:17:39,965 --> 00:17:41,581
Are you to like of Mardi Gras?

208
00:17:42,761 --> 00:17:43,822
Yes.

209
00:17:44,538 --> 00:17:48,048
You didn't find anybody courageous for
to do the trip of the ghosts with you?

210
00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:49,324
No.

211
00:17:50,035 --> 00:17:52,161
Tásse well.
Tásse well.

212
00:17:52,762 --> 00:17:55,449
I have somebody there home
and me in this trip...

213
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:58,084
He/she excuses, I didn't come
in this trip...

214
00:17:58,085 --> 00:18:01,297
...because he/she waited,
that maybe, he/she will know you.

215
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:04,125
If you don't care, it liked
of being to look for this window...

216
00:18:04,126 --> 00:18:06,405
...and to do to yield mine
30 dollars, is it well?

217
00:18:13,834 --> 00:18:15,262
But that thing!

218
00:18:43,853 --> 00:18:47,625
Very well personal.
I am your garçon.

219
00:18:47,703 --> 00:18:49,315
Relax and get ready
for the doors...

220
00:18:49,316 --> 00:18:51,123
Dog, you don't need that.

221
00:18:51,158 --> 00:18:53,374
That is of the size of a Mini.

222
00:18:54,728 --> 00:18:56,930
He/she says what have to say, stupid.

223
00:18:58,159 --> 00:19:02,360
A limusina Mini, are they to see?
It was that I was to say

224
00:19:03,645 --> 00:19:04,542
Me...

225
00:19:04,543 --> 00:19:05,326
No, you...

226
00:19:07,709 --> 00:19:09,967
We were so turns
when we make this.

227
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:12,635
- I am Marcus.
- Jenna.

228
00:19:13,298 --> 00:19:13,984
Hello.

229
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:15,909
Jim Permatteo.

230
00:19:16,739 --> 00:19:19,794
- And this is you, Janet.
- How is it?

231
00:19:19,893 --> 00:19:21,815
Doug Shapiro, a lot of taste.

232
00:19:22,306 --> 00:19:24,476
Beautiful camera.
Is he/she to do a film?

233
00:19:25,397 --> 00:19:26,569
Because.

234
00:19:26,776 --> 00:19:28,321
Who would say tiny.

235
00:19:28,322 --> 00:19:31,955
- We have an enterprising one here.
- That exciting.

236
00:19:32,177 --> 00:19:34,105
What film type?

237
00:19:34,707 --> 00:19:36,636
- Did he/she already hear to speak of the beavers of the lake?
- Clear.

238
00:19:37,411 --> 00:19:38,326
No.

239
00:19:38,327 --> 00:19:41,268
Very well personal,
if they look on the right side...

240
00:19:41,269 --> 00:19:44,369
...they can see the legendary
cemetery of Sant Louis, number 1.

241
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:47,767
Inaugurated 1789.

242
00:19:47,768 --> 00:19:53,095
It is here that jaz the first black,
that is in the memorial of New Orleaes.

243
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:56,133
It is thinks also her
that is the grave...

244
00:19:56,134 --> 00:19:58,699
...of the infamous voodu apprentice,
Marie Labeau.

245
00:19:58,700 --> 00:19:59,802
Yes gentleman.

246
00:20:00,304 --> 00:20:02,897
They know because it is that are
done bury below the ground?

247
00:20:02,898 --> 00:20:05,950
It is because of the curses voodu,
that there is in the air for here.

248
00:20:05,951 --> 00:20:08,294
They have the tendency
of raising of the ground.

249
00:20:08,295 --> 00:20:10,706
Then we liked that
be stamped with cement.

250
00:20:10,707 --> 00:20:13,010
Shawn excuses,
but we heard to say...

251
00:20:13,011 --> 00:20:16,186
...that bury them below the ground
because of the levels of the water.

252
00:20:16,187 --> 00:20:17,187
No!?

253
00:20:17,415 --> 00:20:20,698
He/she is right, the level of the water
it is so loud, that sometimes...

254
00:20:20,699 --> 00:20:23,655
...the things in the ground,
they give á surface.

255
00:20:23,656 --> 00:20:25,359
It is not for that.

256
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,373
- But we heard...
- He/she already said not!

257
00:20:39,796 --> 00:20:43,513
Certain, the time is to pass.
All on board.

258
00:20:44,904 --> 00:20:46,445
Frightening Autocarro.
Frightening boat.

259
00:20:51,592 --> 00:20:52,663
Certain, right.

260
00:20:55,503 --> 00:20:59,535
There is no time, we have
that to hurry, therefore it is.

261
00:21:03,747 --> 00:21:05,375
Certain, certain, to pass.

262
00:21:07,686 --> 00:21:09,330
Well, we have to go.

263
00:21:18,178 --> 00:21:19,380
Bacano...

264
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,006
Is that the boat?

265
00:21:23,325 --> 00:21:25,538
Certain, we will see there something.

266
00:21:28,061 --> 00:21:29,486
They are stupid.

267
00:21:29,787 --> 00:21:31,264
They are duronas.

268
00:21:32,196 --> 00:21:33,303
They are rotate.

269
00:21:34,207 --> 00:21:35,900
They have a secret.

270
00:21:42,754 --> 00:21:44,187
We are going tiny.

271
00:21:48,079 --> 00:21:49,606
In Automatic Pilot.

272
00:21:52,132 --> 00:21:54,684
Certain, here we go us.

273
00:21:57,246 --> 00:21:58,246
You there.

274
00:21:58,747 --> 00:22:00,089
Hello.

275
00:22:01,508 --> 00:22:04,106
Sr. Shawn, think that man
he/she is to try to speak with itself.

276
00:22:04,107 --> 00:22:05,263
No, no...

277
00:22:07,623 --> 00:22:11,653
- Where do they think that go?
- What is he to say her?

278
00:22:12,124 --> 00:22:15,800
That type, don't make case,
it is only a drugged.

279
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:18,043
Done drug?

280
00:22:18,044 --> 00:22:20,285
Yes, yes, a local hunter
of aligátores.

281
00:22:20,353 --> 00:22:23,140
He/she walks thereabout, the hell is bad.
He/she drinks the own urinate.

282
00:22:23,237 --> 00:22:24,744
He is, you know.
A cretin one.

283
00:22:25,578 --> 00:22:26,373
Go there.

284
00:22:27,065 --> 00:22:29,575
This swamp is closed!

285
00:22:33,695 --> 00:22:35,963
The swamp is...!

286
00:22:36,774 --> 00:22:39,803
- Victor Crowley!
- What is him to say her.

287
00:22:44,008 --> 00:22:48,721
Here we go, tell all good-bye,
all say good-bye.

288
00:22:57,368 --> 00:22:59,514
<b > If it was already here,
maintain is alerted.</b>

289
00:23:01,115 --> 00:23:02,477
They will die all.

290
00:23:18,163 --> 00:23:19,085
Remember...

291
00:23:19,086 --> 00:23:21,643
They don't need to have
your things on board.

292
00:23:21,644 --> 00:23:23,576
Only those that don't want lose.

293
00:23:24,335 --> 00:23:27,822
To the because it is, there is gigantic aligátores
in these waters.

294
00:23:28,162 --> 00:23:29,856
Repair, it is not a thing...

295
00:23:29,857 --> 00:23:32,575
...that you see
everyday, but I see.

296
00:23:33,186 --> 00:23:35,276
Live cypresses.

297
00:23:35,873 --> 00:23:38,995
What the Spaniards said
on the cypresses?

298
00:23:39,518 --> 00:23:41,398
"What does care he/she is for here?"

299
00:23:41,982 --> 00:23:44,965
Sometimes story this joke
in Spanish.

300
00:23:45,004 --> 00:23:47,882
The cypress is not the tree
of the state of Louisiana?

301
00:23:47,883 --> 00:23:50,918
- Apposed that is.
- Yes, since 1963.

302
00:23:50,953 --> 00:23:55,547
- The cypresses baldness.
- There is only a tecto in this boat!?

303
00:23:55,977 --> 00:23:59,713
We are going to a part of the swamp
with the most frightening show.

304
00:23:59,714 --> 00:24:05,154
All want animated
or they go embroiders out.

305
00:24:10,647 --> 00:24:13,241
Here in the lake of Mississípi,

306
00:24:13,242 --> 00:24:17,028
hundreds of fishermen
and old pirates lost the life.

307
00:24:17,145 --> 00:24:18,291
And if we have luck...

308
00:24:18,292 --> 00:24:21,787
We can see their souls
to leave the water and to die.

309
00:24:23,858 --> 00:24:27,039
- That is common.
- Go there mine, that is entertaining.

310
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:29,170
As entertaining as one
I take out full of pilas.

311
00:24:29,454 --> 00:24:30,613
That is worse than the hell.

312
00:24:30,614 --> 00:24:33,242
The only frightening thing
he/she is the uncle Limus vs Bruce Lee.

313
00:24:33,277 --> 00:24:38,036
- Until it seems that am in the wave of the South.
- And that small one what vineyard with you?

314
00:24:39,381 --> 00:24:40,478
She is fastens.

315
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:45,524
- But I won't eat her/it in this boat.
- Then in earth, it is for later.

316
00:24:45,726 --> 00:24:49,123
How doesn't the Ian guy know about something?
It is a beautiful coat.

317
00:24:49,611 --> 00:24:53,092
- This was classic.
- Yes!? No so classic...

318
00:24:53,786 --> 00:24:55,442
No as classic as...

319
00:24:55,743 --> 00:24:57,870
- I don't have anything.
- Exacto.

320
00:25:03,127 --> 00:25:06,874
Now, to proceed, they will see one
old abandoned house.

321
00:25:06,875 --> 00:25:10,414
That there is the house
of a legend of Louisiana.

322
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:12,922
Victor Crowley '' Axed.''

323
00:25:13,433 --> 00:25:14,510
The legend counts that:

324
00:25:14,511 --> 00:25:18,272
He was a deformed man,
the father went mad.

325
00:25:18,301 --> 00:25:20,481
One night gave him/her one
axed in the face.

326
00:25:20,701 --> 00:25:25,027
Probably because,
he was ugly or something.

327
00:25:26,176 --> 00:25:27,545
He died.

328
00:25:27,546 --> 00:25:29,421
And history prays that...

329
00:25:29,422 --> 00:25:31,885
...who wants that is close
of the house of Crowley.

330
00:25:32,412 --> 00:25:34,421
They still get to hear
Victor Crowley.

331
00:25:34,422 --> 00:25:36,725
To cry for the father.

332
00:25:41,647 --> 00:25:42,827
Did they hear?

333
00:25:48,155 --> 00:25:49,683
I heard again.

334
00:25:50,316 --> 00:25:53,725
- It is not like this.
- Be how it is, it is like this.

335
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:57,261
- Nor it is the house.
- Do they let to do me my work?

336
00:26:02,656 --> 00:26:04,363
Did they already prove the piranha of here?

337
00:26:05,475 --> 00:26:07,610
I am so excited
for having made this.

338
00:26:07,916 --> 00:26:09,976
That habit that you had at the school.

339
00:26:10,462 --> 00:26:11,234
Where?

340
00:26:11,235 --> 00:26:13,181
- It is as classic as that habit...
- Too late.

341
00:26:13,182 --> 00:26:15,225
- Reason?
- Are you still in the classic?

342
00:26:16,185 --> 00:26:18,379
Prepared to see something frightening?

343
00:26:19,497 --> 00:26:22,788
Are they ready?
Who is ready says "oh yeah."

344
00:26:24,209 --> 00:26:26,752
He/she is well, I will do in the same.
Here we go.

345
00:26:27,019 --> 00:26:29,697
Personal, I will turn off the lights.

346
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:36,705
When the eyes if they adjust,
they will get to see ghosts...

347
00:26:36,706 --> 00:26:39,814
...to the summit of the water,
to the right in the margin.

348
00:26:45,668 --> 00:26:49,035
- I am not to see anything.
- He/she waits until the eyes if they adjust.

349
00:26:49,445 --> 00:26:51,198
They are adjusted, there is nothing there.

350
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:55,327
Can you tie the lights?
You are to destroy my filmings.

351
00:26:58,199 --> 00:27:00,801
He/she looks at Jim, I think am to see something.

352
00:27:01,569 --> 00:27:03,022
Because it is. Are they to see?

353
00:27:03,023 --> 00:27:05,571
It is not only a, they are two ghosts.
I well told you.

354
00:27:05,572 --> 00:27:09,312
That is not only one
chemical reacçao in the water?

355
00:27:09,313 --> 00:27:11,711
No mine, they are ghost, he/she looks.

356
00:27:13,834 --> 00:27:14,858
No bacano.

357
00:27:14,859 --> 00:27:17,744
That is steams of the swamps,
I already saw this in television.

358
00:27:18,149 --> 00:27:21,302
Do go there mine, because you don't align?
They are ghost.

359
00:27:21,734 --> 00:27:23,191
Ah, are right...

360
00:27:25,067 --> 00:27:26,136
But not.

361
00:27:32,514 --> 00:27:33,443
Porra.

362
00:27:34,043 --> 00:27:35,004
Now...

363
00:27:35,405 --> 00:27:39,055
This is besiege where the
Captain John Donovan,

364
00:27:39,056 --> 00:27:42,134
supposedly it buried
a trunk full of treasures.

365
00:27:43,184 --> 00:27:44,274
The legend says that...

366
00:27:44,846 --> 00:27:46,880
...he left two of yours
crew to keep.

367
00:27:46,881 --> 00:27:49,742
But it cut him/her the legs
for them not to flee.

368
00:27:51,198 --> 00:27:52,805
That is a stupid history.

369
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:53,835
He/she is well.

370
00:27:55,713 --> 00:28:00,155
- Jim! Did you see that?
- I saw. What was?

371
00:28:00,803 --> 00:28:04,253
It can be one of the spirits,

372
00:28:04,254 --> 00:28:06,373
that he/she sometimes leaves after raining.

373
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:08,393
Is it frightening, it is not?

374
00:28:11,468 --> 00:28:12,687
Perfect.

375
00:28:13,547 --> 00:28:15,671
Who wants to enter
in the video of the halloween?

376
00:28:16,574 --> 00:28:17,564
Go girls there.

377
00:28:27,655 --> 00:28:32,118
- Your uh is out of time.
- Yes? Your nipples are manure.

378
00:28:33,294 --> 00:28:34,536
That is fastens.

379
00:28:35,435 --> 00:28:36,646
He/she is cold.

380
00:28:39,628 --> 00:28:40,923
You are not very talkative?

381
00:28:41,562 --> 00:28:43,254
I am not here to do friends.

382
00:28:44,557 --> 00:28:45,455
Friends...

383
00:28:46,845 --> 00:28:48,097
You should be of here.

384
00:28:48,941 --> 00:28:50,743
He/she didn't know that you/they took this trip.

385
00:28:50,744 --> 00:28:53,538
- We don't do.
- No, clear, yes, not.

386
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:56,782
Yes, I would not also make him/it.

387
00:28:56,783 --> 00:29:00,425
They were some friends of the university
that you/they said that was fastens, for that...

388
00:29:01,370 --> 00:29:02,788
I thought, that is sanded.

389
00:29:03,647 --> 00:29:05,309
He/she looks at the swamp.

390
00:29:05,871 --> 00:29:09,944
He/she takes advantage of the actividade.
I will be honest with you.

391
00:29:09,979 --> 00:29:14,016
I have just taken with the feet of mine
girlfriend and we already dated 8 years ago.

392
00:29:14,718 --> 00:29:17,958
My friends brought me for here
for to try to forget, but...

393
00:29:19,312 --> 00:29:22,898
We were together
since the 7th year, and...

394
00:29:23,254 --> 00:29:25,183
And he tells me that he/she needs space.

395
00:29:25,184 --> 00:29:27,548
What wants that to say
in girl's language?

396
00:29:27,549 --> 00:29:28,578
Space!?

397
00:29:29,412 --> 00:29:30,231
As it is.

398
00:29:31,117 --> 00:29:32,762
To turn off my mind.

399
00:29:33,172 --> 00:29:35,177
Relax.

400
00:29:39,961 --> 00:29:40,883
What did happen he/she?

401
00:29:40,884 --> 00:29:42,123
Us...

402
00:29:42,888 --> 00:29:44,512
Stagnated Ficámos.

403
00:29:44,935 --> 00:29:46,275
Done stagnate? In the something?

404
00:29:46,276 --> 00:29:49,434
Stones or some thing, I don't know.

405
00:29:53,581 --> 00:29:55,174
Somebody that helps me.

406
00:29:57,621 --> 00:29:59,144
Help me to push the boat.

407
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:04,237
- Is this part of the trip?
- He/she calms, it is everything well.

408
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,682
He/she is part of the trip...

409
00:30:18,121 --> 00:30:19,293
Curse.

410
00:30:20,164 --> 00:30:21,738
To who you will call?
To the father?

411
00:30:21,739 --> 00:30:23,431
He/she silences you hideous.

412
00:30:23,432 --> 00:30:26,258
I will call to the Police
and they order somebody.

413
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:28,606
- Who?
- The police, dah...

414
00:30:29,125 --> 00:30:33,405
Will the Police order the police?
They are the same thing.

415
00:30:33,406 --> 00:30:35,628
They are not anything, there is a difference.

416
00:30:37,067 --> 00:30:41,079
Ladies, I remove the boat of here.
There is no need to call the men.

417
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:43,427
Marcus, help?

418
00:30:43,428 --> 00:30:44,428
That is a drought.

419
00:30:44,429 --> 00:30:45,686
My hair!

420
00:30:46,815 --> 00:30:50,576
- Where do you go?
- He/she already has more than eighteen years...

421
00:30:51,636 --> 00:30:53,721
He/she seats you already.

422
00:30:59,009 --> 00:31:02,624
I am wet.
I know what am to do.

423
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:07,453
You are not still very familiarized
with your histories?

424
00:31:07,488 --> 00:31:09,898
Shawn, how many trips
of these you did already do?

425
00:31:09,899 --> 00:31:12,172
I already did plenty.

426
00:31:12,278 --> 00:31:15,114
Jim, that is fantastic,
what do find?

427
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:18,203
My feet are to be wet!

428
00:31:23,674 --> 00:31:26,891
- Are we to sink?
- No, we are not to sink.

429
00:31:29,208 --> 00:31:31,519
Now it does seem, doesn't it seem?

430
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:34,108
Calm!

431
00:31:34,727 --> 00:31:38,083
The tree where we are stagnated
he/she is going to the margin.

432
00:31:38,084 --> 00:31:40,767
Maybe there be a highway
or a telephone or some thing.

433
00:31:40,768 --> 00:31:45,581
- Here in the middle of the anything?
- We cannot be here.

434
00:31:45,874 --> 00:31:49,230
No Jim, I think owed
to be here, and to wait for help.

435
00:31:49,231 --> 00:31:52,520
Other boat should come
to do this trip, right?

436
00:31:53,307 --> 00:31:57,838
Probably not.
He/she is to rain a lot.

437
00:31:58,167 --> 00:32:02,854
Tiny, we can cross
for this tree to the margin.

438
00:32:02,889 --> 00:32:05,147
No, it seems dangerous.

439
00:32:05,202 --> 00:32:06,269
I could be at a Bar.

440
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:09,841
- You don't go, not!
- Here, it repairs.

441
00:32:12,439 --> 00:32:13,510
Jim waits!

442
00:32:16,862 --> 00:32:18,609
Everything is well,
don't worry.

443
00:32:20,494 --> 00:32:24,233
It is a slippery mouthful,
they have to see where they put the feet.

444
00:32:24,234 --> 00:32:26,693
But I think go...

445
00:32:31,453 --> 00:32:32,630
Somebody that helps me!

446
00:32:33,124 --> 00:32:34,556
He/she is arrested!

447
00:32:36,913 --> 00:32:38,210
He/she is to pull my leg.

448
00:32:43,038 --> 00:32:44,208
Take him/it for the margin.

449
00:32:44,528 --> 00:32:48,190
When it has just rained,
this besieges will be a frenesim.

450
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:50,640
Move!

451
00:32:53,253 --> 00:32:55,363
We go, all to leave the boat,
sink.

452
00:32:55,364 --> 00:32:57,249
Nor to think.
I don't go there outside.

453
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:58,846
You go there outside.

454
00:33:05,637 --> 00:33:08,500
- Jim, are you well, Jim?
- He is well.

455
00:33:08,535 --> 00:33:12,650
It puts the weight on the left side.
It puts the weight in the person on the side.

456
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:21,824
No, don't cry. Don't worry
Everything is well, he/she walks, I help you.

457
00:33:22,183 --> 00:33:23,419
Don't worry, he/she walks.

458
00:33:26,912 --> 00:33:28,385
He/she goes for there.

459
00:33:28,574 --> 00:33:31,957
- He/she walks, he/she lifts you.
- I am not capable.

460
00:33:31,992 --> 00:33:34,087
You have to get up
and to arrive to the highest branch.

461
00:33:34,088 --> 00:33:35,935
I don't want.

462
00:33:38,268 --> 00:33:39,832
He/she walks, I pick you

463
00:33:39,933 --> 00:33:41,879
- He/she lifts you!
- I don't get!

464
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:44,208
Misty, looks at me!

465
00:33:44,209 --> 00:33:46,846
You will be well,
you only have to cross.

466
00:33:47,438 --> 00:33:48,911
He/she walks, I help.

467
00:33:49,183 --> 00:33:51,837
He/she walks, it crosses, there is no time.

468
00:33:55,991 --> 00:33:57,815
He/she walks, fast!

469
00:34:07,799 --> 00:34:09,982
- Leave the water!
- Leave the water!

470
00:34:09,983 --> 00:34:11,384
Leave the water!

471
00:34:11,985 --> 00:34:13,096
Leave the water!

472
00:34:22,236 --> 00:34:23,487
What was this?

473
00:34:25,106 --> 00:34:26,452
He/she walks, I left give!

474
00:34:41,661 --> 00:34:42,689
They go, vain!

475
00:34:48,107 --> 00:34:50,342
- Good, stupid!
- He/she will sand you.

476
00:34:50,843 --> 00:34:55,057
We needed to leave this mud.
The aligátores can return. Vain.

477
00:34:55,247 --> 00:34:56,622
My hat...

478
00:35:07,113 --> 00:35:09,408
Because you are of high jumps?
Slowly, don't hurt you

479
00:35:09,409 --> 00:35:10,816
Are you well?

480
00:35:11,913 --> 00:35:13,408
Care.

481
00:35:15,285 --> 00:35:16,413
Here.

482
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:19,517
My God!

483
00:35:28,814 --> 00:35:31,235
Somebody wants me to say
what is to pass been?

484
00:35:31,236 --> 00:35:34,264
Somebody explains to me
because Jane has a weapon?

485
00:35:34,316 --> 00:35:38,367
- Because you have a weapon?
- Because I should tell you, burlao?

486
00:35:41,183 --> 00:35:44,603
He/she is well, he/she looks...
I will be honest.

487
00:35:44,638 --> 00:35:46,229
Have just moved from Detroit.

488
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:48,450
My brother arranged me
this work.

489
00:35:48,451 --> 00:35:49,888
And that could do
a carload of money.

490
00:35:49,889 --> 00:35:53,443
Then I said, because not.
- How many trips did already take?

491
00:35:53,690 --> 00:35:55,702
And how many boats did already drive?

492
00:35:55,703 --> 00:35:57,655
He/she looks, I did to a trip last night,

493
00:35:57,656 --> 00:35:59,847
and this today á night, is it well?

494
00:36:00,196 --> 00:36:02,160
The boat didn't sink yesterday.

495
00:36:02,747 --> 00:36:04,359
I don't believe in this.

496
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:08,268
And because he/she has her a weapon?
That is what I want to know.

497
00:36:08,269 --> 00:36:10,360
Because I am to the search
of another boat, is it well?

498
00:36:11,990 --> 00:36:13,212
Because my father and my brother,

499
00:36:13,213 --> 00:36:16,700
they walked to the hunt in this river at 2 o'clock
nights behind and they didn't return.

500
00:36:16,917 --> 00:36:19,335
The Police said that owe
to walk in the borga or something.

501
00:36:19,336 --> 00:36:21,162
But I know that not
that that happened was.

502
00:36:21,163 --> 00:36:23,657
Then, you come in a trip
on ghosts?

503
00:36:23,658 --> 00:36:25,170
That doesn't make sense.

504
00:36:25,171 --> 00:36:28,893
30 dollars for a boat are more
cheaply of what to arrange a boat.

505
00:36:29,074 --> 00:36:31,219
He/she still doesn't explain the weapon.

506
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:33,899
Yes. Why is that her
did he/she only pay 30 dollars?

507
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:37,539
I have a weapon because
this forests are not safe.

508
00:36:37,575 --> 00:36:39,896
Haul of that, it ended
of saving him/her the life.

509
00:36:40,141 --> 00:36:41,216
Stop!

510
00:36:41,423 --> 00:36:43,464
My husband needs help.

511
00:36:43,962 --> 00:36:47,112
We needed go look for help,
and we needed to leave these forests.

512
00:36:47,147 --> 00:36:51,035
- Who named you leader?
- We should ask for help and to be here.

513
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:56,295
- There are no Bars. I don't like you.
- I think should not move him/it.

514
00:36:56,310 --> 00:36:57,275
We have.

515
00:36:57,276 --> 00:37:00,035
He/she is to bleed a lot,
we cannot carry him/it until house.

516
00:37:00,036 --> 00:37:03,559
If we don't leave these forests
now, we will die all.

517
00:37:06,075 --> 00:37:07,873
Of the one what are to speak you?

518
00:37:10,572 --> 00:37:13,620
- These forests belong to him.
- ?e who?

519
00:37:14,139 --> 00:37:15,482
Victor Crowley.

520
00:37:16,152 --> 00:37:18,659
Already enough of histories, is it well?

521
00:37:19,122 --> 00:37:21,128
You nor they know where they are.

522
00:37:21,318 --> 00:37:23,996
- I already told you...
- He/she is well, it silences you.

523
00:37:23,997 --> 00:37:25,855
You nor you are of here.

524
00:37:28,157 --> 00:37:29,764
Where are we?

525
00:37:31,789 --> 00:37:33,930
It was a shameful secret.

526
00:37:35,406 --> 00:37:38,499
Victor Crowley was born deformed.

527
00:37:38,922 --> 00:37:42,644
His father maintained him/it closed home.
Where nobody could see him/it.

528
00:37:46,998 --> 00:37:52,761
They lived like this years.
Only them, alone.

529
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:33,955
Victor died from fear
of the other small ones.

530
00:38:34,168 --> 00:38:37,765
They enjoyed with him, they tortured him.
Just as the small ones they do.

531
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,961
It was cruel.

532
00:38:45,594 --> 00:38:49,078
It is then one years later
in the night of the halloween.

533
00:38:49,079 --> 00:38:53,059
Some adolescents went to the house.
They were to try to see him/it.

534
00:38:53,134 --> 00:38:55,239
To try to scare him
for him to leave of house.

535
00:39:24,008 --> 00:39:27,820
Mr. Crowley arrived
and he/she tried to enter, but...

536
00:39:27,821 --> 00:39:29,840
The door was to burn.

537
00:39:31,748 --> 00:39:35,656
He heard Victor to scream there inside
but it was not capable to enter.

538
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:41,178
He/she ran and it went to look for an axe,
and it began to cut the door.

539
00:39:42,364 --> 00:39:46,129
But Victor was
of the other side to try to leave.

540
00:39:48,319 --> 00:39:50,459
It was an accident...

541
00:39:50,691 --> 00:39:53,882
But he got right him/her in the face
with that axe.

542
00:39:54,102 --> 00:39:56,335
And the poor Victor Crowley died.

543
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:02,537
The old became
a hermit after that.

544
00:40:02,538 --> 00:40:04,607
He/she never again left house.

545
00:40:04,642 --> 00:40:08,969
He/she was there almost 10 years before
of dying of destroyed heart.

546
00:40:19,503 --> 00:40:23,120
And from there that the people
they began to disappear in the swamp.

547
00:40:23,417 --> 00:40:24,864
The places and the hunters say,

548
00:40:24,865 --> 00:40:28,322
that if in the approximate-millstones
of the house of Crowley at night.

549
00:40:28,523 --> 00:40:31,459
We still got to hear
Victor Crowley.

550
00:40:31,912 --> 00:40:34,337
To cry for the father in the forests.

551
00:40:35,544 --> 00:40:37,885
They say that he returned.

552
00:40:38,887 --> 00:40:44,253
And it strolls for the swamp at night.
With that wound of the axe in the face.

553
00:40:45,283 --> 00:40:48,344
In this part of the river
it is illegal to come for here.

554
00:40:48,663 --> 00:40:52,014
It is like this to years, it is for that
that there are no other boats.

555
00:40:52,311 --> 00:40:57,327
And it was for that that he brought us for here,
for not being picked in their outlines.

556
00:40:57,812 --> 00:41:01,151
- It was for that that I came.
- For you find your father?

557
00:41:03,046 --> 00:41:04,792
My brother.

558
00:41:05,312 --> 00:41:08,818
He/she began to come to hunt aligátores
for here last week.

559
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:13,008
They thought that won more
because it was the only boat in the swamp.

560
00:41:13,051 --> 00:41:14,768
They told him/her for us not to come!

561
00:41:14,769 --> 00:41:18,278
Then you leaning that a ghost
did he/she pick your family?

562
00:41:18,279 --> 00:41:20,266
That is stupid.

563
00:41:20,267 --> 00:41:21,974
He/she looks to your turn, no there is nobody
in these forests.

564
00:41:21,975 --> 00:41:23,836
There is yes.

565
00:41:24,307 --> 00:41:26,764
They must have been
stagnated just as us.

566
00:41:26,765 --> 00:41:31,064
And they had to walk to house.
Now they should be in Dennis or like this.

567
00:41:31,365 --> 00:41:33,254
The moon on Miami!

568
00:41:33,624 --> 00:41:35,962
Haul of that, we are not
close to the house of Crowley.

569
00:41:35,963 --> 00:41:37,382
Is he/she well? He/she already told you.

570
00:41:37,383 --> 00:41:39,792
It is on the other side of the river,
and to 3 distance quilómetros.

571
00:41:39,793 --> 00:41:42,462
- It was not the house!
- How is it that you know?

572
00:41:42,463 --> 00:41:43,703
Because it is that.

573
00:41:46,313 --> 00:41:50,730
Look. Did I tell the truth, is it well?
I don't import myself if they don't believe.

574
00:41:50,765 --> 00:41:54,573
You are to begin to get scared.

575
00:41:55,191 --> 00:41:58,945
- I only want to go home.
- He/she tells me that this is part of the trip.

576
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:02,659
Oh yes, I sink the boat
all of the nights. It is hilarious.

577
00:42:05,490 --> 00:42:11,108
- I want my money of turn.
- It should have a highway for here.

578
00:42:13,684 --> 00:42:14,969
Shit.

579
00:42:15,970 --> 00:42:18,553
I don't want to go over there.
I don't go over there.

580
00:42:18,610 --> 00:42:22,329
If it is the fastest way,
then it is over there that we go.

581
00:42:22,364 --> 00:42:24,947
Because you were not quiet?

582
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:28,683
We don't have surplus possessions,
you also had to blot us the pants.

583
00:42:28,718 --> 00:42:31,985
I am to try to help,
you had to know the truth.

584
00:42:31,986 --> 00:42:33,216
Rumors.

585
00:42:33,417 --> 00:42:34,217
He/she is well, it is well...

586
00:42:34,418 --> 00:42:36,012
Does it help me to lift him/it, is it well?

587
00:42:36,313 --> 00:42:37,395
Go there.

588
00:42:38,504 --> 00:42:39,910
It catches you to my shoulder.

589
00:42:41,810 --> 00:42:44,907
Care, slowly.
Is he/she already safe, mine?

590
00:42:44,908 --> 00:42:46,320
I am here Jim.

591
00:43:03,982 --> 00:43:06,720
He/she will be everything well.

592
00:43:07,207 --> 00:43:10,057
We will help him/it and we go
all home.

593
00:43:10,431 --> 00:43:12,110
He/she is close to me.

594
00:43:14,234 --> 00:43:16,368
Are you same afraid of that history?

595
00:43:16,669 --> 00:43:20,375
It is only a myth.
Everyone knows a, Bigfoot...

596
00:43:20,376 --> 00:43:23,266
- monster of Lockness...
- Please he/she stops speaking.

597
00:43:27,505 --> 00:43:30,868
I don't believe that am here,
in a swamp.

598
00:43:31,673 --> 00:43:34,340
Apposed that Julia Roberts
he/she didn't have to do this.

599
00:43:34,941 --> 00:43:37,804
You believe in the history
of Victor I don't know about the how many?

600
00:43:37,805 --> 00:43:41,210
Of course no.
I don't trust in anybody of here.

601
00:43:41,368 --> 00:43:44,568
At least in people that only
they want to know of the own family.

602
00:43:49,555 --> 00:43:52,600
Because it is that that brute was
with the dear and the 2 sisters...

603
00:43:52,635 --> 00:43:54,333
...and I have to carry
with the agent?

604
00:43:54,936 --> 00:43:57,972
I feel a lot, he/she didn't want
that this happened.

605
00:43:57,979 --> 00:44:00,687
I only want to arrive to the highway
and later you take some lashes.

606
00:44:00,847 --> 00:44:03,035
Jim, as you are wanted?

607
00:44:03,036 --> 00:44:07,391
I am cold so much!
And it hurts... c'má porra.

608
00:44:07,592 --> 00:44:09,858
The one that distance is the highway
after the house?

609
00:44:12,583 --> 00:44:15,059
I don't know, some quilómetros.

610
00:44:15,321 --> 00:44:18,372
Some quilómetros?
Are you to play?

611
00:44:23,878 --> 00:44:25,231
You...

612
00:44:34,710 --> 00:44:36,501
I want to go home.

613
00:44:38,768 --> 00:44:41,103
All are a cobardes bunch.

614
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:43,521
Is anybody home?

615
00:44:43,934 --> 00:44:45,735
Help us.

616
00:44:46,378 --> 00:44:47,807
We needed help.

617
00:44:48,656 --> 00:44:49,656
Please, stop.

618
00:44:49,657 --> 00:44:52,079
We should not go thereabout,
we have to return back.

619
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:54,454
And to go where?
To return for the water?

620
00:44:55,429 --> 00:44:56,825
Please, stop.

621
00:44:59,588 --> 00:45:01,655
We have to be together,
they have to stop.

622
00:45:01,656 --> 00:45:04,735
Go there, it cannot carry him/it alone.

623
00:45:06,908 --> 00:45:11,206
Dear, it will be everything well.
We didn't need those mad ones.

624
00:45:11,229 --> 00:45:12,813
Cobardes!

625
00:45:13,406 --> 00:45:15,572
Stop! We have to stay together.

626
00:45:16,017 --> 00:45:18,493
He/she will be everything well.

627
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:27,020
We have the Mister connosco, dear.
The Mister it protects us.

628
00:45:44,746 --> 00:45:45,968
My God!

629
00:45:50,668 --> 00:45:51,352
Walk!

630
00:45:54,622 --> 00:45:56,106
Help me, help!

631
00:46:32,365 --> 00:46:33,317
I am I, am me!

632
00:46:34,702 --> 00:46:36,809
- Where are they whole?
- I don't know.

633
00:46:37,853 --> 00:46:41,156
- Here. What did happen he/she?
- They are the two died.

634
00:46:43,144 --> 00:46:45,911
- But I gave him/her a shot.
- Did you give him/her a shot?

635
00:46:45,946 --> 00:46:47,689
But I thought that was a ghost.
You cannot kill a ghost.

636
00:46:47,690 --> 00:46:50,400
- Can you kill a ghost?
- Did you kill him/it?

637
00:46:50,493 --> 00:46:54,025
- I don't know, he fell.
- This is not to happen.

638
00:46:54,296 --> 00:46:56,708
- Where is Marcus?
- Here on top.

639
00:46:58,807 --> 00:47:03,068
- He/she goes down give.
- Nor to think, I am here.

640
00:47:03,153 --> 00:47:07,170
- That is a treta, that is sanded.
- What do get to see you give?

641
00:47:07,370 --> 00:47:10,195
I get to see that there none comes
elephant died to pick me.

642
00:47:10,230 --> 00:47:12,262
You see a highway, lights,
some thing?

643
00:47:15,826 --> 00:47:17,938
I think I see the drop,
but I don't know.

644
00:47:18,717 --> 00:47:20,929
The one what distance?
In what direcçao?

645
00:47:21,653 --> 00:47:25,207
Over there. But it is far,
too far.

646
00:47:26,404 --> 00:47:28,908
You see a highway, cars,
some thing?

647
00:47:28,909 --> 00:47:32,689
That stupid thing my. He/she is dark,
it is wet and I don't get to see pévias.

648
00:47:33,548 --> 00:47:35,486
Wait. Where is Shapiro?

649
00:48:12,077 --> 00:48:14,836
Doug? Shapiro, where are you?

650
00:48:14,837 --> 00:48:16,814
- He/she speaks quietly.
- We have to go.

651
00:48:17,139 --> 00:48:21,103
- We cannot leave him/it here.
- Then it disappears will see of him.

652
00:48:21,452 --> 00:48:24,068
- That was bad.
- He/she tries your telephone.

653
00:48:24,993 --> 00:48:27,645
- I dropped him.
- Did you lose him/it?

654
00:48:27,646 --> 00:48:29,754
- Late!
- It silences you female dog.

655
00:48:29,756 --> 00:48:32,849
Enough. He is not able to
to have gone far. Let us go.

656
00:48:32,850 --> 00:48:34,513
Marcus walks, we leave.

657
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:37,357
Nor to think, I am here.

658
00:48:38,101 --> 00:48:41,284
There is no panic need,
he/she calms you, we will arrange help.

659
00:48:43,337 --> 00:48:46,055
He/she is well, tomorrow
we ordered somebody, we go.

660
00:48:46,056 --> 00:48:50,225
He/she waits, it tolerates there.
I go. Curse.

661
00:48:50,834 --> 00:48:53,345
Nor it was to be here, mine.

662
00:48:53,509 --> 00:48:56,151
It was to be to see mammas, mine.
What does connosco happen?

663
00:48:56,423 --> 00:48:59,659
Shit, as I will go down
of this cursed tree?

664
00:49:03,633 --> 00:49:06,598
Damned! Even in the fruit.

665
00:49:09,157 --> 00:49:10,557
That is a treta!

666
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:15,245
Shit!

667
00:49:51,698 --> 00:49:53,785
If you killed him/it,
we already are not clear?

668
00:49:53,986 --> 00:49:55,491
Maybe he is not a ghost.

669
00:49:55,576 --> 00:49:58,716
Maybe it is a twisted marado,

670
00:49:58,751 --> 00:50:01,098
that he/she likes to sleep a siesta
in the middle of a slaughter.

671
00:50:01,099 --> 00:50:03,853
Yes, and now he is dead
because she gave him/her a shot.

672
00:50:04,187 --> 00:50:06,131
He/she arranges your own theories.

673
00:50:06,744 --> 00:50:07,897
Twisted Marado?

674
00:50:08,418 --> 00:50:10,846
Who says that cannot be
a spoiled boy of the city,

675
00:50:10,847 --> 00:50:14,785
that he/she went mad to do software
porn and did it go back to the parents' house?

676
00:50:14,786 --> 00:50:18,343
For your information,
I am of Valley, not of the city.

677
00:50:18,344 --> 00:50:19,784
Victor Crowley is real.

678
00:50:22,644 --> 00:50:24,974
My mother always said
that sometimes,

679
00:50:25,023 --> 00:50:27,657
if a person dies traumatized,

680
00:50:28,119 --> 00:50:30,844
the spirit is arrested
in the night in that he/she died.

681
00:50:30,845 --> 00:50:32,310
How a poltergeist?

682
00:50:32,311 --> 00:50:35,588
As a ghost
what can move things?

683
00:50:35,623 --> 00:50:40,289
No. As a ghost that can
to cut into pieces a person to your front.

684
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:42,851
I only want to leave of here.

685
00:50:42,886 --> 00:50:45,584
You know that more Jackie Tucker.
You can smell me the rear.

686
00:50:45,928 --> 00:50:48,276
- What did call me?
- You heard.

687
00:50:48,277 --> 00:50:49,882
- He/she says again.
- I say the night all.

688
00:50:49,883 --> 00:50:51,758
Jackie fake Chan,
Chris chupador.

689
00:50:51,759 --> 00:50:53,480
I think a hemerroida
you can get confused.

690
00:50:53,481 --> 00:50:57,451
Does he/she leave me alone, ass face?
It was an accident, for love of God.

691
00:51:01,885 --> 00:51:06,257
Look. I will be honest
with you. I like...

692
00:51:06,918 --> 00:51:07,983
What was?

693
00:51:11,856 --> 00:51:13,035
Go there!

694
00:51:13,036 --> 00:51:15,494
Go there! Shit.

695
00:51:17,266 --> 00:51:19,670
- This is not my fault?
- Seriously?

696
00:51:19,671 --> 00:51:23,449
Seriously. You think I believe
in these histories of ghosts?

697
00:51:23,450 --> 00:51:25,391
Now I believe, you didn't see
that shit there behind?

698
00:51:25,392 --> 00:51:26,509
Boys!

699
00:51:30,183 --> 00:51:32,604
Apposed that this wants to say
that Shapiro was here.

700
00:51:32,705 --> 00:51:36,635
That génio! You know that the vibrator is for
to put in your thing and not in the ear, right?

701
00:51:36,636 --> 00:51:38,742
Because you don't suck him/it
your father again, goat?

702
00:51:38,743 --> 00:51:39,817
I suck after you end.

703
00:51:39,818 --> 00:51:41,174
- He/she is well.
- Fortunately.

704
00:51:43,017 --> 00:51:44,167
Does anybody have a lighter?

705
00:51:45,301 --> 00:51:45,916
What are to do?

706
00:51:52,221 --> 00:51:54,089
In search of this.

707
00:51:55,925 --> 00:51:57,755
What more we have here?

708
00:52:03,167 --> 00:52:04,964
Samuel M Barret?

709
00:52:05,188 --> 00:52:06,237
What is that?

710
00:52:09,474 --> 00:52:10,433
Shapiro.

711
00:52:10,834 --> 00:52:12,010
It is the transport letter

712
00:52:12,567 --> 00:52:13,509
- The something?
- I don't know.

713
00:52:13,610 --> 00:52:15,472
Credit card Samuel M Barret.

714
00:52:15,473 --> 00:52:17,027
10 dollars, preservative.

715
00:52:17,028 --> 00:52:19,858
Card of businesses, and they are two.

716
00:52:19,859 --> 00:52:23,916
Samuel M Barret, diagnoses,
relationships of marketing sénior.

717
00:52:23,917 --> 00:52:26,829
Doug Shapiro, Producer-Director.

718
00:52:27,326 --> 00:52:29,313
That ass face!

719
00:52:29,740 --> 00:52:32,969
I flew of New York here, and him...

720
00:52:35,054 --> 00:52:37,284
Then he didn't work
in the lake of the beavers?

721
00:52:37,319 --> 00:52:38,761
I am to think that not.

722
00:52:38,909 --> 00:52:41,822
Him of having faked to be producing
to have a private colecçao.

723
00:52:42,145 --> 00:52:44,989
- Good idea.
- Perverted.

724
00:52:45,484 --> 00:52:48,230
Why is that the men
are some snotty ones?

725
00:52:49,078 --> 00:52:52,470
I don't believe that
I already fell in this three times.

726
00:52:54,530 --> 00:52:56,458
Does anybody have more secrets?

727
00:52:56,493 --> 00:53:00,001
Because if I discover that is more somebody
to lie, I take oath that the bush me even.

728
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:17,664
I didn't walk in U.N.Y.

729
00:53:19,391 --> 00:53:22,126
It was my first choice,
but I didn't get to enter.

730
00:53:23,530 --> 00:53:27,467
- Then I went to Austra.
- We don't have time for this.

731
00:53:42,756 --> 00:53:45,844
The films in Hollywood,
they should do me famous.

732
00:53:46,507 --> 00:53:49,219
It is now will die here
with you idiots.

733
00:53:49,685 --> 00:53:52,163
Us him matámo-lo?
Nobody will die.

734
00:53:58,750 --> 00:54:00,592
What does anybody make to silence her?

735
00:54:02,067 --> 00:54:03,297
He is still alive.

736
00:54:03,298 --> 00:54:05,840
- No mine, he seems dead...
- It is not him.

737
00:54:06,141 --> 00:54:07,232
Crowley.

738
00:54:07,992 --> 00:54:09,523
Did he/she only take a shot, right?

739
00:54:09,524 --> 00:54:13,837
Maybe have to take 4 or
6 shots, maybe six times!

740
00:54:13,838 --> 00:54:16,873
I don't want him to return,
I don't want to die here.

741
00:54:16,874 --> 00:54:20,919
We should go where sees her the river.
For us not to be more lost.

742
00:54:22,132 --> 00:54:23,740
- Didn't you hear?
- The something?

743
00:54:26,783 --> 00:54:28,105
It is of here.

744
00:54:32,655 --> 00:54:33,858
What is that?

745
00:54:35,863 --> 00:54:36,916
My telemóvel!

746
00:54:47,167 --> 00:54:48,995
- We have net.
- No.

747
00:54:49,778 --> 00:54:51,765
No, it is good.
We can ask for help.

748
00:54:51,766 --> 00:54:52,766
No.

749
00:54:54,084 --> 00:54:56,122
Shit, we walked in circles.

750
00:54:56,123 --> 00:54:59,633
- I thought that you knew this.
- Monitor shit.

751
00:54:59,634 --> 00:55:02,273
- I don't want to beat you, but you...
- He/she shuts up...

752
00:55:08,963 --> 00:55:10,153
I will see on that Thursday.

753
00:55:10,154 --> 00:55:12,267
To see if there is some weapon.
It should have some thing to struggle.

754
00:55:12,268 --> 00:55:15,434
- You cannot return that house.
- I still have some shots.

755
00:55:15,469 --> 00:55:17,330
- We needed some thing.
- And if he returns?

756
00:55:17,331 --> 00:55:18,714
We don't have a long time.

757
00:55:22,812 --> 00:55:24,682
- Be here.
- Fasten.

758
00:55:25,418 --> 00:55:27,009
Do you have net?

759
00:55:27,264 --> 00:55:29,571
Go there! He/she makes the connection.

760
00:55:29,572 --> 00:55:31,718
We should not be here,
we have to go walking.

761
00:55:31,719 --> 00:55:36,230
- It was been to play has to work.
- Scott Barnes calls me.

762
00:55:36,265 --> 00:55:37,197
The something?

763
00:55:37,198 --> 00:55:40,463
- Does he/she mark the numbers?
- Don't leave.

764
00:55:41,279 --> 00:55:43,535
He/she works, damned.

765
00:56:12,739 --> 00:56:15,313
I think he doesn't like
of these things.

766
00:56:41,959 --> 00:56:43,319
The something?

767
00:56:55,934 --> 00:56:58,510
He/she is my father and my brother.

768
00:57:14,710 --> 00:57:18,894
- Are you the sure that the number and the 112?
- Which is that it could be, stupid?

769
00:57:18,929 --> 00:57:22,842
As I can know, it is another area
it can be another code.

770
00:57:27,787 --> 00:57:28,708
The something?

771
00:57:30,190 --> 00:57:30,890
Don't move.

772
00:57:38,553 --> 00:57:39,776
I said...

773
00:57:41,305 --> 00:57:42,544
He/she dispatches you.

774
00:57:46,025 --> 00:57:47,359
I think should run.

775
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:49,908
And if it goes a person
and to need of help?

776
00:57:50,209 --> 00:57:52,880
We apologized later.

777
00:57:55,642 --> 00:57:58,955
- I think is a kitten.
- You are crazy.

778
00:57:58,990 --> 00:58:01,120
If it was the monster
we were already dead.

779
00:58:01,121 --> 00:58:02,919
That this is sanded!

780
00:58:04,421 --> 00:58:05,964
What is that?

781
00:58:09,261 --> 00:58:13,108
- Nor to think, I don't go there.
- And if it goes anybody wounded?

782
00:58:13,109 --> 00:58:16,308
If it is alive it is better than
certain people that we knew.

783
00:58:17,425 --> 00:58:20,935
- You cannot leave a person to die.
- He/she looks to who increased a conscience.

784
00:58:20,970 --> 00:58:22,696
He/she can need help.

785
00:58:23,137 --> 00:58:25,939
- Reason me?
- Because you have a flashlight.

786
00:58:30,461 --> 00:58:34,096
Certain, I already understood.
I already saw what happens.

787
00:58:34,215 --> 00:58:36,272
Does he/she have the brother to be to do him/it?

788
00:58:37,762 --> 00:58:41,437
I am man, I walk here,
I won't also move.

789
00:58:41,438 --> 00:58:43,151
Because or else I graft you.

790
00:58:46,743 --> 00:58:47,848
Shit!

791
00:58:48,549 --> 00:58:49,848
Don't play me mine.

792
00:58:52,326 --> 00:58:54,290
Porra. Certain...

793
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:58,166
We will see if it is a bebé
that is there inside.

794
00:58:58,217 --> 00:58:59,662
Hello bebé.

795
00:59:00,707 --> 00:59:02,286
Are you there inside?

796
00:59:07,993 --> 00:59:08,797
Mine, is only a brute.

797
00:59:33,410 --> 00:59:35,040
My God!

798
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:53,480
Please!

799
00:59:55,371 --> 00:59:56,365
He/she waits, wait!

800
00:59:57,971 --> 01:00:00,059
Leave!

801
01:00:43,833 --> 01:00:45,409
I think already the despistámos.

802
01:00:45,444 --> 01:00:47,827
Wait, I twisted the foot,
I cannot run.

803
01:00:47,992 --> 01:00:51,384
- What is to do, he/she walks.
- He/she silences you erected.

804
01:01:01,118 --> 01:01:02,368
He/she beat me.

805
01:01:02,944 --> 01:01:05,530
It is been silence not you
I break you the teeth.

806
01:01:05,719 --> 01:01:11,142
- Were you capable? Stupid, snail...
- We don't have time for this.

807
01:01:12,815 --> 01:01:15,923
I only want that stops.
Please, I only want to wake up.

808
01:01:16,004 --> 01:01:18,082
We have to move away us of that house.

809
01:01:18,117 --> 01:01:22,456
Don't interest. It is his swamp,
it will kill us to all.

810
01:01:22,457 --> 01:01:24,610
It should have some thing
that can do.

811
01:01:24,645 --> 01:01:27,009
He is arrested in the night
in that was died.

812
01:01:27,044 --> 01:01:29,414
It is gotten angry and afraid.

813
01:01:29,449 --> 01:01:32,336
- He/she will mutilate who approaches.
- Is it if human being?

814
01:01:32,337 --> 01:01:36,329
- And if he didn't die?
- That thing never human being.

815
01:01:37,632 --> 01:01:40,234
Shit. The piles
no longer they last a lot.

816
01:01:40,235 --> 01:01:42,949
- Right. we go, we go.
- So that side?

817
01:01:43,947 --> 01:01:44,822
Over there.

818
01:01:58,814 --> 01:02:00,953
Stop! Stop!

819
01:02:01,625 --> 01:02:03,147
Personal! Stop!

820
01:02:05,003 --> 01:02:08,630
That is useless. He will continue
to come until we be dead.

821
01:02:08,631 --> 01:02:11,175
We cannot stop running.
What can make?

822
01:02:11,325 --> 01:02:13,849
We can hurt him/it.
Ghost or not.

823
01:02:13,850 --> 01:02:17,118
You saw like him fell
when I attacked him/it.

824
01:02:17,119 --> 01:02:18,987
He/she fell when him of this the shot.

825
01:02:19,513 --> 01:02:22,310
- I say for us to struggle.
- How?

826
01:02:23,483 --> 01:02:25,262
Do Misty, still have the lighter?

827
01:02:25,263 --> 01:02:28,006
You want to struggle with that monster
with my lighter?

828
01:02:29,064 --> 01:02:31,343
There were a cans of gasoline
in the hut.

829
01:02:31,378 --> 01:02:33,851
- Were they full?
- I don't know, maybe.

830
01:02:34,052 --> 01:02:36,624
Do you want to return to the hut?

831
01:02:36,625 --> 01:02:39,416
I thought that the plan was move away ourselves
of the hut the most possible.

832
01:02:39,451 --> 01:02:41,919
If we don't kill him/it,
he kills us to all.

833
01:02:42,386 --> 01:02:43,146
You are crazy!

834
01:02:43,147 --> 01:02:45,717
Mine, nor you know if there is
gasoline in my cans.

835
01:02:45,718 --> 01:02:48,379
I know that is better than to walk
to run for these forests...

836
01:02:48,380 --> 01:02:49,897
...and one to be killed by one.

837
01:02:49,898 --> 01:02:51,114
You are right.

838
01:02:51,115 --> 01:02:53,561
Everything is so hot
and will we begin a fire?

839
01:02:53,562 --> 01:02:56,633
If one of us to get to approximate
to throw him/her that gasoline...

840
01:02:56,634 --> 01:02:58,286
We can set on fire him/it.

841
01:02:58,287 --> 01:03:02,633
- All are passed, me no...
- Do you have an it idealizes better?

842
01:03:02,667 --> 01:03:03,867
No.

843
01:03:05,050 --> 01:03:07,109
We will make this. How?

844
01:03:22,715 --> 01:03:24,798
Does it win me time, is it well?

845
01:03:26,601 --> 01:03:28,627
He/she screams if you hear some thing.

846
01:04:05,028 --> 01:04:07,343
- Do you see some thing?
- No.

847
01:04:16,562 --> 01:04:17,659
I am well.

848
01:04:25,034 --> 01:04:27,853
I am not to like of this.
He/she is too calm.

849
01:04:27,854 --> 01:04:32,415
Go there, we will distract him/it.
Idiot, appears, we are here!

850
01:04:32,602 --> 01:04:35,055
He/she appears, it comes to pick us.
Where are you?

851
01:04:35,499 --> 01:04:39,188
Go there eccentric, it seems that
you were violated by wolves.

852
01:04:41,742 --> 01:04:43,559
He/she shows you, ugly.

853
01:04:46,585 --> 01:04:48,103
He/she walks to pick me Crowley.

854
01:04:48,304 --> 01:04:51,972
What was? You are afraid that me
do feel a graft again?

855
01:05:00,016 --> 01:05:03,007
Go there. One for a, you and me.

856
01:05:03,008 --> 01:05:04,538
I bury you my shoe in the ass,

857
01:05:04,539 --> 01:05:06,960
that will defecate attackers
for one week.

858
01:05:17,151 --> 01:05:19,315
- Are you to see some thing?
- Anything.

859
01:05:25,138 --> 01:05:27,429
He is here, it dispatches you. Now!

860
01:06:04,681 --> 01:06:06,064
Yes! Burn.

861
01:06:25,317 --> 01:06:27,382
Should they be to enjoy with me?

862
01:06:30,734 --> 01:06:32,871
- Is it now?
- We leave, we go.

863
01:06:34,326 --> 01:06:36,702
Ben. Ben!

864
01:06:37,059 --> 01:06:37,897
He/she looks at me!

865
01:06:37,898 --> 01:06:41,044
You only win us you time,
don't waste him/it. Let us go!

866
01:07:24,189 --> 01:07:25,202
For here.

867
01:07:25,203 --> 01:07:27,782
He/she should have a road
that he/she gives to leave the cemetery.

868
01:07:39,623 --> 01:07:40,556
Here.

869
01:07:53,117 --> 01:07:56,117
We will follow this even
find-millstones an opening.

870
01:08:05,340 --> 01:08:07,761
- There it is.
- Thanks to God!

871
01:08:27,519 --> 01:08:28,912
He comes there, vain!

872
01:08:34,289 --> 01:08:35,173
There is a gate!

873
01:08:47,282 --> 01:08:48,795
Shit!

874
01:08:54,869 --> 01:08:55,758
He picked me.

875
01:08:56,626 --> 01:08:57,225
Personal...

876
01:08:58,697 --> 01:08:59,751
He will break to the middle!

877
01:09:17,573 --> 01:09:19,324
It was the only gate.

878
01:09:19,325 --> 01:09:21,266
My Porra, are
of turn to the forests.

879
01:09:29,374 --> 01:09:30,038
Run!

880
01:10:12,597 --> 01:10:13,917
He doesn't come.

881
01:10:20,771 --> 01:10:21,865
Marcus!

882
01:10:23,872 --> 01:10:25,881
No longer I can continue.

883
01:10:26,322 --> 01:10:28,540
You can yes. Walk.

884
01:10:29,745 --> 01:10:32,212
I already get to hear
the airplanes in the river. Walk.

885
01:10:32,213 --> 01:10:34,270
Won't we die here, is it well?

886
01:10:34,271 --> 01:10:35,637
Walk!

887
01:10:51,917 --> 01:10:56,474
- No! He there kills us.
- Where do we go?

888
01:11:07,359 --> 01:11:09,300
What wants!
We will push with the knee!

889
01:11:47,029 --> 01:11:48,477
Walk.

890
01:12:12,299 --> 01:12:14,026
I help you, I help you.

891
01:12:15,219 --> 01:12:17,028
He/she is well, it is well.

892
01:12:21,260 --> 01:12:22,916
It is my father's boat.

893
01:12:24,907 --> 01:12:25,859
We go, we go!

894
01:13:06,314 --> 01:13:07,315
Us him apanhámo-lo.

895
01:13:11,073 --> 01:13:12,696
He/she uses this.

896
01:13:28,175 --> 01:13:32,294
Thank you, for you be with me there.

897
01:13:36,872 --> 01:13:38,305
No.

898
01:13:41,412 --> 01:13:43,406
He/she is my father.

899
01:13:47,176 --> 01:13:49,159
It is not easy.

900
01:13:53,134 --> 01:13:54,518
Massacre...

901
01:13:56,673 --> 01:13:58,050
We are alive.

902
01:14:01,199 --> 01:14:02,335
We got.

903
01:14:04,684 --> 01:14:05,862
I know.

904
01:14:13,192 --> 01:14:14,138
No!

905
01:14:15,333 --> 01:14:16,492
Marybeth!

906
01:14:34,965 --> 01:14:36,368
Marybeth!!
