1
00:00:00,358 --> 00:00:01,950
Bun.

2
00:00:02,694 --> 00:00:04,958
Oh, well now, this is good.

3
00:00:05,096 --> 00:00:07,564
OK, Nick, or is it Mr Dick?

4
00:00:08,433 --> 00:00:10,424
Nick.

5
00:00:10,502 --> 00:00:12,697
You wanna do the honors?

6
00:00:19,377 --> 00:00:22,107
- It's up to you.
- Gentlemen.

7
00:00:23,949 --> 00:00:26,076
This is gonna be great!

8
00:00:35,694 --> 00:00:39,186
Here's your orders, ladies.
You can help yourselves.

9
00:00:54,412 --> 00:00:55,879
Is that the foot-long?

10
00:00:55,947 --> 00:00:58,006
And then some.

11
00:01:24,576 --> 00:01:26,635
Excuse us. Mom, let go.

12
00:01:52,537 --> 00:01:54,596
Hey, lady, how much?

13
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:57,200
Talk to the pimp.

14
00:01:58,343 --> 00:01:59,367
Hi.

15
00:01:59,778 --> 00:02:00,870
Hi.

16
00:02:00,979 --> 00:02:02,571
Hey, nice seeing you.

17
00:02:02,647 --> 00:02:04,080
Hello.

18
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,809
Hey, let's talk.

19
00:02:08,353 --> 00:02:10,787
Hey, bro! What it be?

20
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:15,420
- You're a pimp? You look like Gandhi.
- I'm telling you I am, Joe.

21
00:02:15,493 --> 00:02:17,654
- I want women.
- I got women.

22
00:02:17,762 --> 00:02:20,287
They sit on your face, anything you want.

23
00:02:20,398 --> 00:02:22,457
Great. I want some. How much?

24
00:02:22,801 --> 00:02:26,362
Big hassle now, bro.
Soon they go to customers.

25
00:02:26,504 --> 00:02:29,837
I got a bachelor party at the Parkview Hotel.

26
00:02:29,908 --> 00:02:32,604
That would be out of sight, dude.

27
00:02:32,677 --> 00:02:35,077
Customers in same hotel.

28
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:39,480
Let you have them at cut-rate price
for 45 minutes.

29
00:02:39,584 --> 00:02:42,417
- $200.
- Great.

30
00:02:42,487 --> 00:02:44,978
Sold. 45 minutes, no problem.

31
00:02:45,056 --> 00:02:46,455
Room 1002.

32
00:02:46,658 --> 00:02:50,025
Not one minute longer
or Milt will come for you.

33
00:02:50,095 --> 00:02:51,722
Milt?

34
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:53,695
This being Milt.

35
00:02:56,067 --> 00:02:58,126
Pretty heavy, hey, dude?

36
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:05,532
Girls back in 45 minutes

37
00:03:05,944 --> 00:03:08,742
or Milt cuts your balls off.

38
00:03:08,847 --> 00:03:10,337
Fair enough?

39
00:03:10,448 --> 00:03:11,881
Shake.

40
00:03:18,857 --> 00:03:21,849
I just bet my balls, and shook on it.

41
00:03:25,697 --> 00:03:27,562
Did you happen to see Tina's face?

42
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:32,660
Bobbi was less shocked, of course.
She's used to seeing something that size.

43
00:03:33,838 --> 00:03:35,829
Hey, yo! Brad!

44
00:03:37,108 --> 00:03:39,167
Hey! Big Brad!

45
00:03:41,446 --> 00:03:43,175
Where's the young man?

46
00:03:51,589 --> 00:03:53,489
What are you doing?

47
00:03:53,558 --> 00:03:55,651
I'm killing myself.

48
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:57,684
Oh.

49
00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:09,196
You know, Brad, marriage
is a dicey thing at best.

50
00:04:09,307 --> 00:04:12,105
And sometimes people say
things they don't mean.

51
00:04:12,177 --> 00:04:16,011
But you and Sue, you're mature people.
You'll work this stuff out.

52
00:04:16,114 --> 00:04:20,175
- You gotta lighten up, man.
- No, Rick, I don't care any more!

53
00:04:20,285 --> 00:04:25,552
She hates me! I'm no good for her.
I'm just gonna end it all right here!

54
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:30,759
Oh! Oh! God!

55
00:04:32,997 --> 00:04:34,931
Are you all right?

56
00:04:34,999 --> 00:04:37,092
Yeah.

57
00:04:37,936 --> 00:04:40,598
Pain is such a rush.

58
00:04:42,307 --> 00:04:44,332
Oh, this is good.

59
00:04:44,442 --> 00:04:47,900
- Is there anything I can do for ya?
- Oh, no...

60
00:04:49,114 --> 00:04:51,173
This is pain.

61
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,809
Fabulous.

62
00:04:54,119 --> 00:04:56,849
There could be some major damage here.

63
00:05:01,527 --> 00:05:04,223
Mmm! Mmmm!

64
00:05:19,745 --> 00:05:23,408
Hey, man!
Go check out your car. It's beautiful.

65
00:05:23,549 --> 00:05:26,347
- My car? Where is it?
- It's outside.

66
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:40,765
Shit!

67
00:05:42,568 --> 00:05:44,627
Shit!

68
00:05:46,271 --> 00:05:48,364
Oh, shit!

69
00:05:49,508 --> 00:05:50,566
Shit!

70
00:05:51,109 --> 00:05:52,167
Shit!

71
00:05:52,878 --> 00:05:54,641
Shit! Shit!

72
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,644
Rick, goddamnit!

73
00:05:57,983 --> 00:06:01,248
You've had it! I'm gonna get you!

74
00:06:11,897 --> 00:06:13,524
Shit!

75
00:06:13,632 --> 00:06:15,293
Shit! Shit!

76
00:06:17,736 --> 00:06:21,331
This is your bachelor party,
and you're not havin' a good time.

77
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,271
I'm having a great time!

78
00:06:23,342 --> 00:06:25,902
You're making a big deal out of nothing.

79
00:06:26,245 --> 00:06:28,713
- Where the hell is everybody?
- I don't know.

80
00:06:28,814 --> 00:06:30,873
Surprise!

81
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:33,875
The team bus just pulled in!

82
00:06:40,325 --> 00:06:41,656
Hookers!

83
00:06:41,727 --> 00:06:44,491
It's a party! Party, Ricky!

84
00:06:55,073 --> 00:06:57,633
I had a wiener right in my hand.

85
00:06:57,709 --> 00:07:02,544
I told you, men are pigs.
I saw those swine just standing there.

86
00:07:02,681 --> 00:07:05,172
God! What a gross thing to do.

87
00:07:05,284 --> 00:07:09,277
I have to admit, even for Rick,
that was beyond the Valley of Good Taste.

88
00:07:09,354 --> 00:07:13,518
Yeah, well, Rick and his pals are
probably knee-deep in whores by now.

89
00:07:13,659 --> 00:07:16,526
- I can't wait to see what those guys are up to.
- Me either.

90
00:07:16,795 --> 00:07:20,322
If I find out Stanley's been
screwing around, I'll kill him.

91
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:24,995
Kill? I won't do anything that drastic.
I just won't get married.

92
00:07:25,103 --> 00:07:27,697
Good. You're finally talking some sense.

93
00:07:27,773 --> 00:07:31,174
Well... let's get ready, you guys.
Let's get going.

94
00:07:31,276 --> 00:07:35,804
- You with us, Mom?
- A strange wang right in my palm.

95
00:07:39,551 --> 00:07:41,348
- Can I help you?
- We're the band.

96
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:43,217
- Band?
- O'Neill sent us.

97
00:07:43,322 --> 00:07:45,187
Oh, O'Neill! Great!

98
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:49,226
Everybody's busy in the bedrooms
right now, but come on in.

99
00:07:49,328 --> 00:07:53,287
Oh, that's nice hair. I'll try to make sure
no one smokes around you.

100
00:07:53,365 --> 00:07:56,425
Are you together? If not,
maybe introductions are in order.

101
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,766
"Why do good girls like bad boys?

102
00:08:04,643 --> 00:08:06,770
"Why do good girls like bad boys?

103
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:12,413
"It must be the thrill she gets
When he lights her cigarette

104
00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:16,447
"Or the way his nostrils flare
Every time he combs his hair

00:08:16,788 --> 00:08:18,619
"Why do good girls like bad boys?

106

"Why do good girls like bad boys?

107
00:08:27,532 --> 00:08:29,591
Alligator!

108
00:08:44,449 --> 00:08:48,215
Hey, that was incredible. And also wonderful.

109
00:08:49,421 --> 00:08:53,187
It was a moving experience. I thank you.
From the bottom of my heart.

110
00:08:53,258 --> 00:08:55,351
Next!

111
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:59,255
Ricky! Go, babe. Get in there, my brother.

112
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:02,690
My dearest family member, get in there.
She's incredible.

113
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:07,066
No, no, no. I will, but the party's young
and it's just starting up.

114
00:09:07,172 --> 00:09:11,506
I want to ask you a question first. You're my
older brother. Let me ask you some advice.

115
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:14,704
You are a married man, right?
I am about to be a married man.

116
00:09:14,846 --> 00:09:18,304
What can I expect from this marriage thing?
What is the honest scoop?

117
00:09:18,417 --> 00:09:23,616
The honest scoop? The first month,
from the beginning, is terrific. It's great.

118
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:27,283
The second month,
things calm down a little bit.

119
00:09:29,227 --> 00:09:33,323
Third month, you're looking through
old phone numbers, old girlfriends...

120
00:09:33,432 --> 00:09:38,927
But, by the fourth month... by the fourth
month you're just... you're numb.

121
00:09:39,671 --> 00:09:41,935
You know? Just... It's incredible.

122
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:45,635
So by the fifth month,
hopefully, football season starts.

123
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:49,111
- Football.
- You got ball games. You got Monday Night.

124
00:09:49,214 --> 00:09:55,676
Stan, I am so glad we had this chat.
You've really answered my questions.

125
00:09:57,289 --> 00:10:02,158
Hi. We were just walking by and
we heard the music. Can we come in?

126
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:06,026
Sure! Come on in! Join the party, babe.

127
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,705
What can I get for 25 bucks?

128
00:10:17,042 --> 00:10:20,739
An elevator ride around the block,
a pogo pump, or a pogo swirl,

129
00:10:20,846 --> 00:10:23,178
or a pump with an underground hammer.

130
00:10:23,281 --> 00:10:26,375
Wait a minute.
Whatever happened to hand jobs?

131
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:45,566
Hi.

132
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:47,467
Hello.

133
00:11:04,322 --> 00:11:05,880
"I was dreaming

134
00:11:05,991 --> 00:11:07,481
"Woke up screaming

135
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:09,618
"I was drowning in a pool of sweat

136
00:11:10,729 --> 00:11:12,560
"My hands were shaking

137
00:11:12,631 --> 00:11:14,292
"My head was aching

138
00:11:14,366 --> 00:11:16,425
"My stomach was so upset

139
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:24,207
"That's when I saw two eyes
glowing in the dark

140
00:11:24,609 --> 00:11:28,045
"I fell in love with a little demon

141
00:11:28,146 --> 00:11:31,377
"Little demon, little demon

142
00:11:31,716 --> 00:11:35,311
"Angels above can't take my little demon

143
00:11:35,387 --> 00:11:38,254
"Little demon, little demon

00:11:38,356 --> 00:11:40,654
"Little demon!

145
00:11:45,964 --> 00:11:47,591
"She crawled up beside me

146
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:49,827
"Her smile terrified me

147
00:11:49,935 --> 00:11:52,768
"And I was suffering in ecstasy

148
00:12:07,285 --> 00:12:10,743
- What the hell are you doing?
- I'm slashing my wrists.

149
00:12:10,822 --> 00:12:14,656
- With an electric razor?
- I couldn't find any razor blades.

150
00:12:15,393 --> 00:12:18,294
At least your wrists will
be smooth and kissable.

151
00:12:18,396 --> 00:12:21,058
Give me this thing!
What is the matter with you?

152
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:25,500
Will you go out there and have some fun
and have a few laughs, please?

153
00:12:28,306 --> 00:12:31,275
No, no, no. Have fun first,
and then have a few laughs.

154
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:34,277
Just forget about the marriage
for a couple of hours.

155
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:37,507
This is a party, remember?
Go out there and party.

156
00:12:40,652 --> 00:12:42,916
That's good. That's good.

157
00:12:56,935 --> 00:12:59,301
Gary, how's the big stallion?

158
00:12:59,504 --> 00:13:02,029
Rick, I really think I'm in love.

159
00:13:03,341 --> 00:13:07,641
We're talking marriage, kids, the whole thing.

160
00:13:08,647 --> 00:13:13,016
I'm very happy for you.
Name your first six kids after me, OK?

161
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:05,261
My name is Tim. I'm always available.

162
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:08,100
By the way, I also do engine work on BMWs.

163
00:14:08,573 --> 00:14:09,801
Bye.

164
00:14:52,384 --> 00:14:55,717
That's another example of
better living through chemistry.

165
00:14:55,787 --> 00:14:57,516
I said that's another example...

166
00:14:57,589 --> 00:15:00,456
Are these on or am I wasting my time?

167
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:14,060
All right!

168
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,531
This is gonna be great.

169
00:15:17,609 --> 00:15:19,577
Sex with a donkey. Incredible.

170
00:15:50,275 --> 00:15:52,402
Hi! Come on in!

171
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:55,272
Drugs to the right, hookers to the left.

172
00:15:58,817 --> 00:16:00,876
Good to see ya again.

173
00:16:26,444 --> 00:16:29,242
Hey! I oughta smack you.

174
00:16:30,148 --> 00:16:33,640
Rick, buddy... pal of mine...

175
00:16:34,486 --> 00:16:37,284
- I'm concerned.
- Hey! What about?

176
00:16:37,355 --> 00:16:41,758
This is your party! Your bachelor party!
You haven't had sex with anyone yet.

177
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:44,158
Not true. I had a bunch of sex tonight.

178
00:16:44,262 --> 00:16:48,289
I'm just very fast. You haven't been able
to see me. There - I had it twice!

179
00:16:48,366 --> 00:16:51,062
Come on. I got something you can't resist.

180
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:52,159
You do?

181
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:54,329
You remember Tracey?

182
00:16:54,739 --> 00:16:58,539
Tracey? I am a mortal man, O'Neill.
Of course I remember Tracey.

183
00:16:58,643 --> 00:17:01,168
You remember how crazy
she was about you?

184
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:06,683
- Tracey was crazy about me?
- "Oh, Rick, you're so funny!"

185
00:17:06,751 --> 00:17:11,552
I called her and told her that you were
about to be put on the unavailable list.

186
00:17:11,656 --> 00:17:14,682
She decided to come over and
give you a little something.

187
00:17:14,759 --> 00:17:16,852
She did?

188
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:20,187
- Right in there.
- The bedroom? Tracey's in the bedroom?

189
00:17:20,298 --> 00:17:21,356
You got it.

190
00:17:21,499 --> 00:17:24,491
- Tracey is in the bedroom?
- Heaven awaits.

191
00:17:27,872 --> 00:17:29,931
O'Neill...

192
00:17:31,142 --> 00:17:35,408
Oh... well, now, O'Neill, this is a gift I...

193
00:17:35,547 --> 00:17:37,606
You bet.

194
00:17:37,782 --> 00:17:40,910
How can I... how can I turn this down?

195
00:17:40,985 --> 00:17:42,612
You can't.

196
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,779
I guess I can't.

197
00:17:45,156 --> 00:17:47,420
- Oh, Tracey...?
- Yeah.

198
00:17:49,561 --> 00:17:53,292
Oh, hell, all right. All right, I will.
All right, OK. I will. All right.

199
00:17:53,364 --> 00:17:56,299
If I'm not back in half an hour,
call the paramedics.

200
00:17:56,367 --> 00:17:57,629
All right.

201
00:17:57,735 --> 00:17:59,430
That's the old Rick!

202
00:18:07,845 --> 00:18:09,506
Hello?

203
00:18:17,722 --> 00:18:19,781
Oh, eat my chair!

204
00:18:34,939 --> 00:18:37,669
Rick, take me, please.

205
00:18:39,978 --> 00:18:42,606
Rick, you promised me.

206
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:46,275
You promised me you wouldn't
make love to anybody else.

207
00:18:47,218 --> 00:18:49,243
Go for it! Go for it!

208
00:18:54,826 --> 00:19:00,093
Don't go back on your word, Rick.
Be true. Be strong.

209
00:19:00,198 --> 00:19:02,063
Go for it!

210
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:06,698
What, are you nuts? Look at my tits!
They're perfect!

211
00:19:07,405 --> 00:19:10,397
Rick, take me, please.

212
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:17,411
How'd it go?

213
00:19:17,482 --> 00:19:22,078
Well, hey... Hey, if she can walk,
I don't know my business, you know?

214
00:19:23,121 --> 00:19:27,490
Oh, hey, O'Neill, I just lied.
Nothing happened in there, all right?

215
00:19:27,592 --> 00:19:31,050
I know how much this meant to ya,
but I couldn't do it, OK?

216
00:19:31,129 --> 00:19:34,064
I love Debbie.
I made a promise and I'm crazy about her.

217
00:19:34,132 --> 00:19:36,225
Hey, I understand.

218
00:19:36,634 --> 00:19:38,329
Don't worry about it.

219
00:19:38,436 --> 00:19:43,703
To tell you the truth, I'm envious. I wish
I had someone who was in my every thought.

220
00:19:43,808 --> 00:19:46,470
Somebody I could spend all my time with.

221
00:19:47,045 --> 00:19:49,536
Somebody I could really respect.

222
00:19:49,647 --> 00:19:52,343
Hey, look at the cans on that bimbo.

223
00:21:06,157 --> 00:21:09,217
I am looking for this dung head
who took my women.

224
00:21:09,327 --> 00:21:11,295
He's being liar to me.

225
00:21:11,362 --> 00:21:13,193
I want my bitches back.

226
00:21:29,247 --> 00:21:32,978
Holy shit! I'm going to get Milt right now.

227
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:35,245
I'm going to get the fuck out of here.

228
00:21:42,126 --> 00:21:44,356
- Who was that?
- I don't know.

229
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:46,521
- Well, what is this?
- Got me.

230
00:21:47,632 --> 00:21:50,931
- Well, how about this?
- Still drawing a blank.

231
00:21:53,538 --> 00:21:56,439
- Hey, he look familiar?
- Very.

232
00:21:56,541 --> 00:22:00,739
Get the hookers in a circle.
We're gonna put Cochise out of business.

233
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:16,017
I can't believe we're doing this.

234
00:22:16,093 --> 00:22:18,994
We are supposed to be hookers. Act sexy.

235
00:22:24,669 --> 00:22:26,603
If Stanley's there I'll rip his butt.

236
00:22:26,671 --> 00:22:31,040
Stop with this! We're supposed
to be hookers! Act sexy!

237
00:22:33,177 --> 00:22:36,010
- I just wanna find him up there...
- Shut up with that.

238
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:40,642
Don't tell me to shut up. We don't need sex,
we just have to find the room.

239
00:22:45,623 --> 00:22:47,591
You girls is the hookers, right?

240
00:22:47,725 --> 00:22:49,818
Yes, of course we're hookers.

241
00:23:00,037 --> 00:23:05,100
- The boss said deliver hookers.
- We are not hookers, you big dumb ape!

242
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:14,509
How dare you!

243
00:23:20,491 --> 00:23:23,289
Girls, let's get outta here...

244
00:23:23,361 --> 00:23:25,454
Wonderful!

245
00:23:34,138 --> 00:23:36,629
Any of you guys from out of town?

246
00:23:37,675 --> 00:23:40,166
Come on, fellas... Fellas!

247
00:23:49,053 --> 00:23:50,486
Where the hell is he?

248
00:23:51,289 --> 00:23:54,850
- It's gotta be on this side.
- No, it's this side.

249
00:24:00,464 --> 00:24:02,364
Shit! Shit! Shit!

250
00:24:02,466 --> 00:24:04,525
All right, this is it.

251
00:24:04,769 --> 00:24:07,260
Let me fix you up here. Let's show the gold.

252
00:24:07,338 --> 00:24:09,397
Beautiful. Gorgeous.

253
00:24:10,408 --> 00:24:12,501
OK. Go get him.

254
00:24:29,727 --> 00:24:31,922
Make love to me... please?

255
00:24:55,753 --> 00:25:00,918
T minus 3, 2, 1. We have ignition!

256
00:25:01,158 --> 00:25:03,217
Kill!

257
00:25:11,969 --> 00:25:14,460
We got him now!

258
00:25:16,474 --> 00:25:18,567
No! No!

259
00:25:21,545 --> 00:25:23,206
You can't do this!

260
00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:27,014
We're just gonna put you in
a safe place until after the party.

261
00:25:27,852 --> 00:25:31,788
No, no! Please! Please stop! Don't! No!

262
00:25:32,356 --> 00:25:34,483
Hey! Hey, you guys can't do this!

263
00:25:34,959 --> 00:25:37,484
Hey! Hey, come on!

264
00:25:43,234 --> 00:25:45,498
Now you stay out of trouble, young man.

265
00:25:45,603 --> 00:25:46,763
Take care!

266
00:25:46,837 --> 00:25:49,101
I hope you die, you bastard!

267
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:51,299
Bye!

268
00:25:52,877 --> 00:25:55,812
Hey, you bastards! I'm gonna live!

269
00:25:58,182 --> 00:25:59,240
Aaghhh!

270
00:25:59,984 --> 00:26:01,815
Well, here we are.

271
00:26:02,853 --> 00:26:07,847
This is gonna be some night, huh?
Are you ready for this? Are you ready?

272
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:11,519
Come here.

273
00:26:14,198 --> 00:26:18,828
Look, uh... why don't you make
yourself comfortable, all right?

274
00:26:21,939 --> 00:26:24,407
There's a terrific moon out tonight.

275
00:26:55,506 --> 00:26:58,634
OK, we're here.
How do we get this donkey inside?

276
00:26:58,709 --> 00:27:00,768
I don't know.

277
00:27:01,912 --> 00:27:05,075
You don't know?
You had it all figured out. You had a plan.

278
00:27:05,149 --> 00:27:07,879
Well, maybe I did. I don't know. I forgot.

279
00:27:10,121 --> 00:27:13,887
I'd like to get you on an operating table,
just once.

280
00:27:16,093 --> 00:27:18,459
Ha-ha-ha!

281
00:27:18,529 --> 00:27:20,463
Ha-ha-ha what?

282
00:27:20,664 --> 00:27:22,996
- I got it.
- You got what?

283
00:27:25,002 --> 00:27:29,302
You're gonna be OK. Everything's
gonna be fine. Don't worry about it.

284
00:27:29,406 --> 00:27:34,469
How about some air? You can take in
some air. That'd be nice, wouldn't it?

285
00:27:34,545 --> 00:27:36,376
Take in some air, huh?

286
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:41,375
Oh, no! Shit!

287
00:27:43,787 --> 00:27:46,221
- Are you sure you're OK?
- Yes.

288
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,134
Ohh, God...!

289
00:27:59,770 --> 00:28:01,397
They seemed like nice guys.

290
00:28:01,505 --> 00:28:06,238
- Thanks for your help, Ed. We appreciate it.
- Any time, Al. Good night.

291
00:28:07,411 --> 00:28:11,245
Cole?! My God, son, what are you
doing here? What happened?

292
00:28:11,348 --> 00:28:14,943
The party's upstairs, sir.
They made me get naked and...

293
00:28:15,019 --> 00:28:15,849
What?

294
00:28:15,953 --> 00:28:20,253
They made me get naked and hung me out
from the window. It was so scary and I fell.

295
00:28:20,357 --> 00:28:22,917
Get a hold of yourself.
What room are they in?

296
00:28:22,993 --> 00:28:27,123
- They're on the tenth floor, sir.
- I'm going up there. I'll take care of this.

297
00:28:27,198 --> 00:28:30,793
Now you go and get yourself
some clothes. You look awful.

298
00:28:30,868 --> 00:28:32,335
Yes, sir.

299
00:28:36,373 --> 00:28:40,537
OK, this side 27. This side 17.
Ready? Here we go. Go, go, go!

300
00:29:01,966 --> 00:29:04,799
How ya doing, everybody?
We brought back a friend.

301
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:11,000
Gentlemen, ladies, for your
viewing pleasure, meet Max,

302
00:29:11,075 --> 00:29:13,600
the magical, sexual mule!

303
00:29:14,645 --> 00:29:17,614
A donkey that doesn't wanna be recognized?

304
00:29:17,681 --> 00:29:20,775
Something interesting is gonna happen here.

305
00:29:21,719 --> 00:29:26,884
And here's Max's partner. A gal who doesn't
believe happiness ends with primates.

306
00:29:27,324 --> 00:29:29,849
The lovely Miss Desiree!

307
00:30:12,136 --> 00:30:14,934
My God! What are you people doing in here?!

308
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:18,099
Uh-oh. It's Mr Laughs.

309
00:30:22,713 --> 00:30:26,649
Rick, I knew you were
a vile, disgusting degenerate,

310
00:30:26,717 --> 00:30:28,912
but bestiality?

311
00:30:28,986 --> 00:30:31,853
This goes beyond my wildest dreams.

312
00:30:31,922 --> 00:30:34,390
Well, I like to stretch myself on occasion.

313
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:42,162
You're through, mister. When Debbie hears
about this, she will never see you again.

314
00:30:42,366 --> 00:30:44,266
You're right, Mr Thompson.

315
00:30:44,335 --> 00:30:49,534
You should go give Debbie a call right now.
There's a phone in the back bedroom.

316
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:55,169
You're through, mister.

317
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,477
Well, thanks, pal!

318
00:30:58,549 --> 00:31:01,484
If Debbie finds out about this, I am dead!

319
00:31:01,552 --> 00:31:05,215
Will you relax?!
I have everything under control.

320
00:31:05,556 --> 00:31:08,218
Hired help... ladies... follow me.

321
00:31:21,338 --> 00:31:25,536
Sorry for the interruption, folks.
We now return you to the arts.

322
00:32:48,058 --> 00:32:50,424
Stand back! I'm a doctor!

323
00:32:50,494 --> 00:32:51,518
Back!

324
00:33:01,472 --> 00:33:04,999
Of course we don't allow
that sort of thing here, ma'am. No.

325
00:33:05,075 --> 00:33:09,739
I'm sorry that the noise woke you up.
I will take care of it right away.

326
00:33:10,314 --> 00:33:12,407
I've had enough of this.

327
00:33:26,897 --> 00:33:29,764
- Let's just give 'em what they want.
- What?!

328
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:32,460
Let's go. Come on, everybody inside!

329
00:33:32,536 --> 00:33:36,063
The big show's gonna start
in one minute. Come on!

330
00:33:40,777 --> 00:33:43,371
We're gonna have so much fun!

331
00:33:43,947 --> 00:33:46,142
Get outta here! Go! Go!

332
00:33:46,450 --> 00:33:50,318
Everyone, go! I'll hold them off.
The rest of you make a break for it.

333
00:33:50,387 --> 00:33:52,685
Ilene, are you crazy? Come on, let's go!

334
00:33:52,756 --> 00:33:56,988
Debbie, please, I know what
I'm doing. Now just go. Go!

335
00:34:03,967 --> 00:34:08,461
OK, gentlemen, the gods
have answered your prayers!

336
00:34:09,139 --> 00:34:10,663
Banzai!

337
00:34:21,118 --> 00:34:25,316
- I hope llene is all right.
- I hope those guys are all right.

338
00:34:27,024 --> 00:34:29,219
- Oh, my God.
- Ohhh!

339
00:34:29,326 --> 00:34:30,987
Gross!

340
00:34:38,969 --> 00:34:41,130
1002.

341
00:35:29,853 --> 00:35:32,822
Guess who's here? Another surprise guest.

342
00:35:32,889 --> 00:35:33,878
Who?

343
00:35:33,991 --> 00:35:36,858
Does the name Debbie
mean anything to you?

344
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,894
What, my Debbie?

345
00:35:39,363 --> 00:35:43,561
- What's with the costume?
- I don't know! Listen, do me a favor.

346
00:35:43,634 --> 00:35:47,570
Go up to her like you don't know her
and send her into the back bedroom.

347
00:35:47,638 --> 00:35:49,503
You got it.

348
00:35:52,643 --> 00:35:55,771
Hi, baby. You're new here.

349
00:35:56,980 --> 00:36:01,508
- I don't believe the groom has had you yet.
- No, not...

350
00:36:01,885 --> 00:36:06,117
No, not yet. Where is the groom?

351
00:36:06,423 --> 00:36:08,186
In the bedroom.

352
00:36:08,258 --> 00:36:09,885
Thanks.

353
00:36:26,143 --> 00:36:28,304
Hey, it's dark in here.

354
00:36:28,412 --> 00:36:32,542
Don't turn on the lights, sugar.
I'll lead you around.

355
00:36:32,649 --> 00:36:36,551
Oh, well, a seeing-eye hooker.
This is a nice service.

356
00:36:37,287 --> 00:36:42,486
Hey, you don't look half bad!
Let's see how you are in the sack! Yeehah!

357
00:36:46,897 --> 00:36:48,455
Damn you, Rick!

358
00:36:54,438 --> 00:36:56,929
Debbie, you're a hooker! I don't believe it!

359
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,837
I can't trust you!

360
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:01,839
Come on. I knew it was you.

361
00:37:04,581 --> 00:37:05,377
Hey!

362
00:37:05,482 --> 00:37:09,441
- Rick, you're lying!
- It was ajoke! Debbie!

363
00:37:11,722 --> 00:37:14,384
Wait! Just hold on! Wait!

364
00:37:14,491 --> 00:37:17,483
Hold on! Please, just give
me a chance to explain!

365
00:37:17,561 --> 00:37:18,585
Debbie!

366
00:37:18,995 --> 00:37:19,962
Debbie!

367
00:37:20,063 --> 00:37:22,463
Debbie, I didn't do anything!

368
00:37:22,532 --> 00:37:23,794
Well, hardly.

369
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:28,860
The marriage is off! You can screw around
with your friends for the rest of your life!

370
00:37:28,939 --> 00:37:31,100
I don't want that! I want you!

371
00:37:31,208 --> 00:37:33,972
And I want somebody who
understands commitment!

372
00:37:34,077 --> 00:37:36,671
I understand commitment! I love you!

373
00:37:36,747 --> 00:37:40,205
- I don't believe you.
- You don't? Oh, fine. Good.

374
00:37:40,317 --> 00:37:41,511
Hey! Hey!

375
00:37:41,585 --> 00:37:43,712
People! Attention, please!

376
00:37:43,787 --> 00:37:45,345
Shut up!

377
00:37:48,024 --> 00:37:50,993
Have I had sex with anyone
in this room tonight?

378
00:37:51,094 --> 00:37:53,153
No!

379
00:37:53,797 --> 00:37:56,231
You're sure about this?

380
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:58,492
Yes!

381
00:37:59,102 --> 00:38:01,798
Fine, good. Resume party.

382
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:06,602
Understand?

383
00:38:06,777 --> 00:38:11,339
Now this isn't your ordinary party crowd
here. There are professionals in here.

384
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:13,507
But I didn't want them.

385
00:38:13,583 --> 00:38:16,450
You... you're the only one I've ever wanted.

386
00:38:18,522 --> 00:38:20,387
Do you understand?

387
00:38:20,457 --> 00:38:22,118
Yeah.

388
00:38:32,402 --> 00:38:34,870
So what do we do about it?

389
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:38,601
Let's get naked.

390
00:38:38,975 --> 00:38:40,636
OK.

391
00:38:45,882 --> 00:38:47,816
No, Debbie, not that bedroom!

392
00:38:51,221 --> 00:38:53,212
Daddy?

393
00:38:53,356 --> 00:38:58,350
All my years as a photographer, I've never
seen such a natural. The camera loves him!

394
00:38:58,428 --> 00:38:59,861
Grrrrrr!

395
00:39:01,064 --> 00:39:03,225
Daddy, what are you doing here?

396
00:39:07,871 --> 00:39:12,001
He says he's having a wonderful time and
thinking of changing his name to Spike.

397
00:39:12,442 --> 00:39:13,875
Grrrrr!

398
00:39:14,244 --> 00:39:18,772
I've been getting calls all night.
God only knows what they're doing in there.

399
00:39:18,849 --> 00:39:20,510
Open up! You're under arrest!

400
00:39:23,253 --> 00:39:24,845
All right, boys, break it in.

401
00:39:24,921 --> 00:39:27,788
Hold it, hold it, hold it. I've got the key.

402
00:39:31,261 --> 00:39:33,388
Let's go! It's a raid!

403
00:39:34,865 --> 00:39:36,457
Whoa! The cops!

404
00:40:27,484 --> 00:40:29,111
Mom?

405
00:40:31,788 --> 00:40:33,847
Back exit!

406
00:40:37,794 --> 00:40:39,261
Debbie!

407
00:40:40,597 --> 00:40:42,064
Debbie!

408
00:40:45,869 --> 00:40:47,302
Rick!

409
00:40:49,673 --> 00:40:50,298
Rick!

410
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:53,703
Diana Ross is playing next week.
I got three tickets.

411
00:40:53,777 --> 00:40:55,768
How about Boy George? The Police?

412
00:40:55,879 --> 00:40:57,005
Oh, hi!

413
00:40:57,113 --> 00:40:58,671
Oh, no! Not her!

414
00:40:58,748 --> 00:41:00,773
No! No! Anything but that!

415
00:41:00,884 --> 00:41:02,749
No, not her! Not her!

416
00:41:02,819 --> 00:41:05,379
She pees standing up! Not her!

417
00:41:11,094 --> 00:41:14,120
Stan! You lying dog!

418
00:41:17,167 --> 00:41:19,192
Hey, wait a minute. Hold it.

419
00:41:19,302 --> 00:41:22,829
What did you say, Stanley?
What did you say, Stanley?

420
00:41:23,173 --> 00:41:24,936
What did you say, Stanley?

421
00:41:25,008 --> 00:41:27,977
You said no hookers! You said no hookers!

422
00:41:28,044 --> 00:41:30,308
No hookers! No hookers!

423
00:41:32,449 --> 00:41:33,939
Debbie!

424
00:41:39,422 --> 00:41:41,390
Where is Debbie? Where is Debbie?

425
00:41:47,163 --> 00:41:50,155
- What are you doing?!
- Debbie, you'll always be mine!

426
00:41:50,233 --> 00:41:51,427
Rick!

427
00:41:52,068 --> 00:41:53,660
Hey, have you seen Debbie?

428
00:41:53,770 --> 00:41:54,998
Shit! Shit!

429
00:41:59,009 --> 00:42:00,442
Shit!

430
00:42:01,845 --> 00:42:04,336
- I thought she was just next to you.
- No.

431
00:42:07,217 --> 00:42:08,684
Oh, shit!

432
00:42:14,024 --> 00:42:16,083
Get outta there!

433
00:42:19,496 --> 00:42:22,226
- Cole!
- You're coming with me!

434
00:42:23,433 --> 00:42:26,061
God, he's kidnapping her! Back to the bus!

435
00:42:44,187 --> 00:42:45,711
Help! Rick!

436
00:43:22,525 --> 00:43:25,426
Debbie! You're coming in with me!

437
00:43:27,831 --> 00:43:30,299
Cole, I've had enough. How about you, huh?

438
00:43:30,366 --> 00:43:32,459
- Come with me!
- Just give it a rest.

439
00:43:32,535 --> 00:43:33,661
No!

440
00:43:33,770 --> 00:43:35,260
Tickets. Hey!

441
00:43:59,062 --> 00:44:01,121
Tickets? Tickets?

442
00:44:09,205 --> 00:44:11,935
There's 36 theaters. They could be anywhere.

443
00:44:12,008 --> 00:44:13,805
Oh, great.

444
00:44:13,910 --> 00:44:17,607
- Now what do we do?
- Let's just split up. We'll go this way.

445
00:44:17,881 --> 00:44:19,508
Ryko!

446
00:44:20,617 --> 00:44:24,610
I killed the mule! I killed the...

447
00:44:30,927 --> 00:44:34,226
What is the sense of living?

448
00:44:39,936 --> 00:44:42,803
I'll take this theater.
Ryko, take the one down there.

449
00:44:45,942 --> 00:44:48,001
Ooh. Small theater.

450
00:45:00,523 --> 00:45:02,115
Rick?

451
00:45:02,192 --> 00:45:03,853
Rick!

452
00:45:20,476 --> 00:45:22,444
What a realistic effect!

453
00:45:45,668 --> 00:45:48,364
This is the best 3-D I've ever seen!

454
00:45:48,438 --> 00:45:50,497
I've seen better.

455
00:45:55,912 --> 00:45:57,174
Wow!

456
00:46:19,435 --> 00:46:24,805
This time I'm gonna do it,
and nobody's gonna stop me.

457
00:46:40,023 --> 00:46:42,082
Fuck...!

458
00:47:06,282 --> 00:47:09,046
Do you, Richard Ernesto Gassko,

459
00:47:09,185 --> 00:47:13,884
take Deborah Julie Thompson
as your lawful wife,

460
00:47:14,090 --> 00:47:16,718
to have and to hold from this day forward,

461
00:47:16,793 --> 00:47:19,694
for better for worse, for richer for poorer,

462
00:47:19,762 --> 00:47:21,559
in sickness and in health,

463
00:47:21,664 --> 00:47:24,258
until death do you part?

464
00:47:24,334 --> 00:47:26,268
I sure do.

465
00:47:38,147 --> 00:47:42,880
So by the powers vested in me,
I now pronounce you man and wife.

466
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:45,178
You may kiss the bride.

467
00:47:47,190 --> 00:47:51,627
Uh... I'm sorry. It needs
something special here.

468
00:47:51,728 --> 00:47:53,787
Hold on. Wait.

469
00:47:54,831 --> 00:47:57,129
Oh, God Almighty!

470
00:48:00,103 --> 00:48:03,800
How about this? Come on, we're
married now. This is perfectly legal.

471
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:05,830
Honey!

472
00:48:05,942 --> 00:48:09,309
Rick, stop it! Get that thing away from me!

473
00:48:12,582 --> 00:48:14,641
Come here, Mrs Gassko.

474
00:48:17,453 --> 00:48:20,149
Step on it, driver.
We don't wanna miss our plane.

475
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:21,520
Right.

476
