1
01:33:40,717 --> 01:33:44,073
Who did you bring home last year?
Sheila...?

2
01:33:44,237 --> 01:33:48,674
- I didn't go home last year.
- What about the year before?

3
01:33:48,837 --> 01:33:52,796
I'm not the first girl
you ever brought home, right?

4
01:33:53,597 --> 01:33:57,385
Jackson! Oh, God!

5
01:33:57,557 --> 01:33:59,866
Oh, no!

6
01:34:00,037 --> 01:34:02,756
This makes it worse.

7
01:34:32,357 --> 01:34:35,747
You never told me it was like this.

8
01:34:35,917 --> 01:34:42,914
It's a farm. There's a mortgage.
It's no big deal.

9
01:34:43,077 --> 01:34:45,386
My God!

10
01:34:49,717 --> 01:34:54,916
- Some farmhouse you've got here.
- Watch your step on the ice.

11
01:35:16,837 --> 01:35:20,386
Come along. Don't be impressed.

12
01:35:25,917 --> 01:35:30,195
- Hush, you'll wake her up.
- I'm sorry.

13
01:35:31,397 --> 01:35:34,912
- She's put you in the guest room.
- Bummer.

14
01:35:35,077 --> 01:35:38,547
- Where are you?
- Across the hall.

15
01:35:40,037 --> 01:35:43,712
- Well, it's her house.
- It's a Catholic thing.

16
01:35:44,997 --> 01:35:48,194
- Come on.
- No way.

17
01:35:48,357 --> 01:35:53,067
I'll sneak you back
before she knows.

18
01:36:11,677 --> 01:36:16,512
An angel in the kitchen
and a devil in the bedroom...

19
01:36:16,677 --> 01:36:20,226
Now that's what I like in a man.

20
01:36:20,997 --> 01:36:25,195
Oh, my God!

21
01:36:25,357 --> 01:36:30,226
I am sorry. I thought you were
in the other room.

22
01:36:30,397 --> 01:36:36,188
I am. I just came in here
this morning... to say hello.

23
01:36:36,357 --> 01:36:40,873
I guess I'd better hurry up
and be embarrassed.

24
01:36:41,037 --> 01:36:44,871
- I thought you were Jackson.
- Yes, I could tell.

25
01:36:46,397 --> 01:36:50,675
- Please forgive me.
- No, I just...

26
01:36:50,837 --> 01:36:54,273
- Well, hi, I'm Helen.
- Of course you are.

27
01:36:54,437 --> 01:36:58,874
I'm Martha Baring.
Welcome to Kilronan.

28
01:36:59,037 --> 01:37:05,146
- Thank you. Oh, boy!
- Where is that son of mine?

29
01:37:05,317 --> 01:37:09,196
I don't know,
but I'd like to find him.

30
01:37:09,357 --> 01:37:11,825
So would I.

31
01:37:13,837 --> 01:37:17,796
So much for first impressions.
You enjoy his breakfast.

32
01:37:17,957 --> 01:37:21,586
I look forward to seeing
a lot less of you downstairs.

33
01:37:21,757 --> 01:37:25,306
Oh, my God!

34
01:37:32,157 --> 01:37:36,992
You show a lot of promise
for a city girl.

35
01:37:37,157 --> 01:37:41,673
- Thank you. You're a terrific liar.
- Well...!

36
01:37:41,837 --> 01:37:46,353
- Mom, the place looks great.
- Only when it's covered with snow.

37
01:37:46,517 --> 01:37:50,635
It's been hard this fall,
but that's too depressing.

38
01:37:50,797 --> 01:37:54,915
Let talk about our week. I made
some plans. I hope you don't mind.

39
01:37:55,077 --> 01:37:58,433
- We can't stay the week.
- Of course you can.

40
01:37:58,597 --> 01:38:02,829
We have to leave
right after Christmas. I'm sorry.

41
01:38:04,197 --> 01:38:08,031
- Darling...!
- We have to leave on Wednesday.

42
01:38:10,397 --> 01:38:15,073
Of course, if you have to leave.
I just thought maybe...

43
01:38:15,237 --> 01:38:18,707
Well, never mind.

44
01:38:18,877 --> 01:38:23,393
Look at the time.
We have to get back for church.

45
01:38:28,157 --> 01:38:32,833
- Go on. Go after her.
- She misses me.

46
01:38:32,997 --> 01:38:35,716
Go.

47
01:38:41,317 --> 01:38:46,550
I made a better impression
with my clothes <i>off</i>.

48
01:38:46,717 --> 01:38:51,393
You look great. You look beautiful.

49
01:38:51,557 --> 01:38:57,871
I love this house, Jackson.
There's something about it.

50
01:38:58,037 --> 01:39:00,597
- I suppose.
- Maybe it's you.

51
01:39:00,757 --> 01:39:06,673
- How me?
- Where you're from. Who you are.

52
01:39:06,837 --> 01:39:10,147
The architecture of a life.

53
01:39:11,517 --> 01:39:15,396
- Pretentious?
- Just a little.

54
01:39:17,397 --> 01:39:21,026
What?

55
01:39:39,717 --> 01:39:43,392
Look at you.
You're putting me to shame.

56
01:39:43,557 --> 01:39:46,913
Do you think
this is too much for church?

57
01:39:47,077 --> 01:39:50,990
No, not at all.
I envy your confidence.

58
01:39:52,397 --> 01:39:56,709
Are you sure?
I did bring another one.

59
01:39:56,877 --> 01:40:02,634
I'm just worried you'll get cold
in that freezing old church. Here.

60
01:40:04,517 --> 01:40:09,272
- Oh, it's broken.
- It's just an old catch.

61
01:40:10,597 --> 01:40:13,987
I'll have it fixed.

62
01:40:14,157 --> 01:40:19,311
- Are these your parents?
- Yes.

63
01:40:19,477 --> 01:40:26,189
- And where are they this Christmas?
- They died... a long time ago.

64
01:40:26,357 --> 01:40:30,145
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

65
01:40:31,837 --> 01:40:35,989
Okay, you can stop talking about me.

66
01:40:38,357 --> 01:40:40,666
Let's go.

67
01:40:40,837 --> 01:40:43,397
Go ahead... Please, go on.

68
01:40:43,557 --> 01:40:46,629
I love the scarf.

69
01:40:47,677 --> 01:40:52,956
"And the angel came to her and said:
The Lord is with thee."

70
01:40:53,117 --> 01:40:56,348
"And you will conceive in your womb
and bear a son."

71
01:40:56,517 --> 01:41:01,875
"The Lord God will give him
the throne of his father David."

72
01:41:02,037 --> 01:41:04,676
"His kingdom shall be without end."

73
01:41:04,837 --> 01:41:07,954
Amen.

74
01:41:12,997 --> 01:41:18,913
- Hello, Father.
- Jackson, the prodigal returns.

75
01:41:19,077 --> 01:41:24,629
Baring and Son, back in business.
You've made your mother very happy.

76
01:41:24,797 --> 01:41:28,836
I've been happy
since the day he was born.

77
01:41:31,677 --> 01:41:36,910
Does everyone think I'm moving in,
or is Madge just a trial balloon?

78
01:41:37,077 --> 01:41:40,035
I put an ad in the paper.

79
01:41:40,197 --> 01:41:44,429
I didn't,
but I guess my hopes were showing.

80
01:41:44,597 --> 01:41:48,590
You want me to work this place,
but my job's in New York.

81
01:41:48,757 --> 01:41:53,194
- You don't love that job.
- Helen's in New York.

82
01:41:53,357 --> 01:41:55,871
That's mighty inconsiderate of you.

83
01:41:56,037 --> 01:42:02,670
Steal away my baby boy.
Why can't you just be sensible?

84
01:42:02,837 --> 01:42:05,874
Leave your life, your work,
your friends, -

85
01:42:06,037 --> 01:42:09,109
- and move in
with a controlling old woman.

86
01:42:09,277 --> 01:42:16,672
- Bake bread and shovel horse shit.
- You're not that old.

87
01:42:16,837 --> 01:42:21,865
I'm sorry, sweetheart.
Don't let Madge spoil our Christmas.

88
01:42:23,117 --> 01:42:26,951
- Good night.
- Good night.

89
01:42:53,437 --> 01:42:56,429
Martha.

90
01:43:17,237 --> 01:43:20,354
Hello.

91
01:43:20,517 --> 01:43:26,274
I'm sorry to disturb you. I'm lost.
I'm looking for Kilronan.

92
01:43:26,437 --> 01:43:29,793
Back thataways.
The tar road.

93
01:43:29,957 --> 01:43:34,473
- Second on the left.
- Okay, thank you.

94
01:43:34,637 --> 01:43:40,234
Tell Mrs. Baring
I'll bring the birds by later on.

95
01:43:40,397 --> 01:43:42,627
Merry Christmas.

96
01:43:45,477 --> 01:43:52,155
- Where've you been?
- I'll tell you about it later.

97
01:43:52,317 --> 01:43:58,153
- You cleaned up? I'm shocked.
- It must have been my mother.

98
01:44:00,517 --> 01:44:03,236
She does all this with no help?

99
01:44:03,397 --> 01:44:07,515
The help never stays. She doesn't
give them anything to do.

100
01:44:07,677 --> 01:44:11,226
I caved in.
We're staying for New Year's Eve.

101
01:44:11,397 --> 01:44:14,514
Ten, nine, eight, seven, -

102
01:44:14,677 --> 01:44:17,635
- six, five, four, three, -

103
01:44:17,797 --> 01:44:21,915
- two, one... Happy New Year!

104
01:44:22,077 --> 01:44:24,352
Happy New Year.

105
01:44:27,357 --> 01:44:31,270
- Still love me?
- I'll love you, dear.

106
01:44:31,437 --> 01:44:34,713
I'll love you
till China and Africa meet...

107
01:44:34,877 --> 01:44:39,951
...and the river jumps over
the mountains.

108
01:44:59,557 --> 01:45:03,106
- Did you have a good time?
- It was a great party.

109
01:45:03,277 --> 01:45:08,192
I'd say it was a triumph.
Short-lived maybe... never mind.

110
01:45:08,357 --> 01:45:13,636
- Here's to you, my darlings.
- Good night.

111
01:45:29,397 --> 01:45:33,549
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

112
01:45:43,717 --> 01:45:46,629
Oh, my God! Jackson!

113
01:45:46,797 --> 01:45:51,587
You're right, you do make a better
impression with your clothes off.

114
01:46:28,917 --> 01:46:33,388
- All ready?
- I think so.

115
01:46:33,557 --> 01:46:39,109
I almost forgot.
I had it fixed.

116
01:46:40,477 --> 01:46:44,356
You shouldn't have.

117
01:46:45,357 --> 01:46:49,748
- It's perfect.
- Well...

118
01:46:56,397 --> 01:47:03,075
- Now I've gone and set you off.
- I'm not so good with goodbyes.

119
01:47:04,837 --> 01:47:07,954
Well, you just go on then.

120
01:47:08,517 --> 01:47:12,066
Bye, Mom.

121
01:47:15,077 --> 01:47:19,389
Bye, baby. You take care out there.

122
01:48:00,557 --> 01:48:03,754
Last flight.

123
01:48:06,237 --> 01:48:10,992
- I know, I haven't fixed it yet.
- You are so punished.

124
01:48:11,157 --> 01:48:14,991
- No sex.
- Not again.

125
01:48:15,157 --> 01:48:19,275
Oh well, be it ever so humble...

126
01:48:19,437 --> 01:48:22,235
Home, sweet home.

127
01:48:24,557 --> 01:48:29,073
- How was the vacation?
- His mom was great. He was weird.

128
01:48:29,237 --> 01:48:31,592
It's being around their mothers.

129
01:48:31,757 --> 01:48:35,352
It's all about the breasts.

130
01:48:35,517 --> 01:48:39,396
Men are always talking to their
shrinks about their mothers.

131
01:48:39,557 --> 01:48:45,871
And women always talking to their
shrinks about their mothers-in-law.

132
01:48:46,037 --> 01:48:49,586
Like mine.
I'm not joking. You'll see.

133
01:48:49,757 --> 01:48:54,353
Wait, you marry the guy.
The mother is his problem.

134
01:48:54,517 --> 01:48:59,033
We've projected to complete
that phase within 16 months.

135
01:48:59,197 --> 01:49:04,317
This new triple-E glass
is non-reflective -

136
01:49:04,477 --> 01:49:10,632
- minimalizing visual impact,
optimalizing, if that's a word -

137
01:49:10,797 --> 01:49:16,190
- energy conservation
for both heating... and cooling.

138
01:49:18,237 --> 01:49:21,786
The 60% glass...

139
01:49:49,517 --> 01:49:52,987
You're home early. Are you okay?

140
01:49:54,077 --> 01:49:57,786
- I don't know.
- What do you mean?

141
01:49:58,717 --> 01:50:00,628
I'm pregnant.

142
01:50:05,717 --> 01:50:11,269
This is where you're supposed to go,
"Are you sure?"

143
01:50:11,437 --> 01:50:16,306
It seems my diaphragm is broken.

144
01:50:18,757 --> 01:50:24,150
- Marry me.
- Oh, Jackson...

145
01:50:24,317 --> 01:50:28,356
I think I lost my job today, too.
I barfed on Gavin.

146
01:50:31,557 --> 01:50:36,790
You said you wouldn't get married
unless you were pregnant.

147
01:50:36,957 --> 01:50:39,994
You're pregnant. It's settled.

148
01:50:41,677 --> 01:50:44,749
I love you.

149
01:50:45,637 --> 01:50:48,231
Marry me.

150
01:50:51,677 --> 01:50:53,986
Is that a yes?

151
01:51:10,717 --> 01:51:15,188
- <i>Are you sitting down?</i>
- Don't tell her I'm pregnant.

152
01:51:15,357 --> 01:51:19,191
- <i>What is it? Tell me.</i>
- Helen and I are getting married.

153
01:51:20,837 --> 01:51:24,876
- She's pregnant, isn't she?
- How did you guess?

154
01:51:27,757 --> 01:51:32,194
Mothers know these things.
Where is she? Is she there?

155
01:51:32,357 --> 01:51:38,034
- Hi, Martha.
- <i>Isn't this the best news ever?</i>

156
01:51:38,197 --> 01:51:42,907
A baby...
and a wedding, too, I suppose.

157
01:51:43,077 --> 01:51:46,387
When will it be?
We'd better hurry, hadn't we?

158
01:51:46,557 --> 01:51:49,469
<i>We could have it here at Kilronan.</i>

159
01:51:49,637 --> 01:51:55,189
- We were thinking of City Hall.
- We were?

160
01:51:56,677 --> 01:52:01,512
May the Lord bless these rings
as a sign of your fidelity and love.

161
01:52:01,677 --> 01:52:05,511
What God hath joined together
let no man put asunder.

162
01:52:05,677 --> 01:52:09,750
By the power vested in me
I now pronounce you man and wife.

163
01:52:09,917 --> 01:52:12,875
You may kiss the bride.

164
01:52:20,837 --> 01:52:23,590
- You look lovely.
- Good luck, Helen.

165
01:52:23,757 --> 01:52:28,353
- Hi, congratulations.
- Thanks.

166
01:52:29,277 --> 01:52:30,869
Hi.

167
01:52:31,037 --> 01:52:35,394
Hey, how are you holding up?

168
01:52:37,357 --> 01:52:41,873
- I'm dying.
- So Helen...

169
01:52:42,037 --> 01:52:45,074
- Who's that?
- I don't know.

170
01:52:47,197 --> 01:52:50,155
- What?
- She got him back.

171
01:52:50,317 --> 01:52:53,707
- Who?
- Your new mother-in-law.

172
01:52:53,877 --> 01:52:57,552
- You never showed for lunch.
- Were we supposed to?

173
01:52:57,717 --> 01:53:01,756
You could come visit me
at the home for the near dead.

174
01:53:01,917 --> 01:53:05,671
Your mother-in-law said
you had bigger fish to fry.

175
01:53:07,277 --> 01:53:09,996
Alice Baring.
I'm Jackson's grandmother.

176
01:53:10,157 --> 01:53:15,470
I'm sorry. Hello, she never told me
we were supposed to have lunch.

177
01:53:15,637 --> 01:53:19,630
She wouldn't.
You have to be so careful of Martha.

178
01:53:19,797 --> 01:53:26,873
That's why I invited myself. I'm the
only one left on his father's side.

179
01:53:27,037 --> 01:53:30,234
Let's see the handcuff?

180
01:53:30,397 --> 01:53:36,393
- It looks familiar.
- It belonged to Jackson's mother.

181
01:53:36,557 --> 01:53:40,596
I gave it to her...
that was before I knew her better.

182
01:53:40,757 --> 01:53:44,750
- When are you due?
- How did you know that?

183
01:53:44,917 --> 01:53:51,231
You can't be stupid breeding horses.
It takes knowhow and control.

184
01:53:51,397 --> 01:53:54,514
One man to help the stallion.
One to help the mare.

185
01:53:54,677 --> 01:53:58,272
One to hold the tail,
and one to finesse the situation.

186
01:53:59,277 --> 01:54:03,953
Now Martha, she can manage
all that by herself.

187
01:54:04,117 --> 01:54:07,996
Alice! What a surprise!
I didn't think you could make it.

188
01:54:08,157 --> 01:54:14,073
Yes, wasn't it lucky?
I just followed the catering trucks.

189
01:54:14,237 --> 01:54:20,153
Why don't you come with me?
They want a picture of you two.

190
01:54:22,557 --> 01:54:26,152
- Take your damn hands off me.
- Oh, Alice.

191
01:55:37,357 --> 01:55:40,793
One word
and I'll slice you wide open.

192
01:55:40,957 --> 01:55:45,394
- You got that, pretty lady?
- Please, don't hurt me.

193
01:55:47,277 --> 01:55:53,466
- My very pretty lady.
- Please, I'm pregnant.

194
01:55:59,837 --> 01:56:05,355
I know where you live.
Don't you forget that.

195
01:56:35,597 --> 01:56:38,236
Very close call.

196
01:56:38,397 --> 01:56:44,233
- You told him you were pregnant?
- Most men run when they hear that.

197
01:56:44,397 --> 01:56:47,992
Bad joke. I'm sorry.

198
01:56:48,157 --> 01:56:53,231
- You take care and get some rest.
- Okay.

199
01:56:58,477 --> 01:57:03,028
I can't get his voice
out of my head.

200
01:57:32,637 --> 01:57:37,153
- My God! I can't go!
- Look...

201
01:57:39,557 --> 01:57:44,312
And I changed the locks.

202
01:57:53,917 --> 01:58:01,505
Are you okay? You sure?
You're going to be all right.

203
01:58:01,677 --> 01:58:03,429
Surprise!

204
01:58:06,557 --> 01:58:10,709
Honey, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to frighten you.

205
01:58:10,877 --> 01:58:14,392
- How did you get in here?
- The super let me in.

206
01:58:14,557 --> 01:58:19,995
Hello, darling.
Hi, good to see you.

207
01:58:21,877 --> 01:58:24,835
You're sure you're all right?

208
01:58:26,437 --> 01:58:30,396
- He took my locket.
- Oh, no!

209
01:58:30,557 --> 01:58:37,713
With the picture of your parents?
Darling, I'm so sorry.

210
01:58:41,997 --> 01:58:45,672
The land alone
is worth more than this.

211
01:58:45,837 --> 01:58:50,228
It's a developer.
You know, golf course and houses.

212
01:58:50,397 --> 01:58:55,073
They'll have to tear out
all the barns, the paddocks.

213
01:58:55,237 --> 01:58:58,946
Turn the pastures into fairways.

214
01:58:59,117 --> 01:59:03,315
Kilronan...
Country Club and Estates.

215
01:59:03,477 --> 01:59:06,708
Can you imagine?

216
01:59:06,877 --> 01:59:10,347
Two years ago we were offered
three times this much.

217
01:59:10,517 --> 01:59:15,147
Then, it was a going concern.
The oldest horse farm in the county.

218
01:59:17,997 --> 01:59:23,629
- Where are you going to go?
- I don't know.

219
01:59:23,797 --> 01:59:26,391
I've never been anywhere else.

220
01:59:28,837 --> 01:59:38,030
Look, Jackson... I can't run
that place all by myself any more.

221
01:59:38,197 --> 01:59:41,746
And if you can't help...

222
01:59:41,917 --> 01:59:47,037
...then you've
got to let me sell it.

223
01:59:47,197 --> 01:59:50,394
I'm going to get the coffee.

224
01:59:54,237 --> 02:00:01,029
- Does she need your permission?
- It's mine, all of it.

225
02:00:01,197 --> 02:00:05,076
It was left to me, not to Martha.

226
02:00:14,237 --> 02:00:18,753
How long do you think it would take
to fix up Kilronan?

227
02:00:18,917 --> 02:00:25,834
Renovate the stables, the stock
is down to nothing... maybe a year.

228
02:00:25,997 --> 02:00:30,548
- Make it attractive to a buyer?
- I'll run some projections.

229
02:00:30,717 --> 02:00:35,552
- Why don't we do it?
- I will, in the morning.

230
02:00:35,717 --> 02:00:40,871
No, I mean
why don't we do the whole thing?

231
02:00:41,037 --> 02:00:44,427
What do you mean?

232
02:00:44,597 --> 02:00:47,589
This could be a great opportunity.

233
02:00:47,757 --> 02:00:52,273
You could do the horses
and I could do the house.

234
02:00:52,437 --> 02:00:55,190
There's two mortgages.

235
02:00:55,357 --> 02:00:59,953
They'd fall all over themselves
to loan you money.

236
02:01:00,117 --> 02:01:06,556
- What do you think?
- I don't know.

237
02:01:06,717 --> 02:01:10,073
I just don't know.

238
02:01:14,397 --> 02:01:18,356
Maybe we'll fall in love
with the place and want to stay?

239
02:01:18,517 --> 02:01:23,637
- What about my mom?
- What about her? I like her.

240
02:01:23,797 --> 02:01:29,269
- What about the baby?
- My God! What was I thinking?

241
02:01:29,437 --> 02:01:33,316
Deprive my child
of the wholesome family values -

242
02:01:33,477 --> 02:01:36,150
- of a New York City childhood.

243
02:01:36,317 --> 02:01:40,515
The dirt, the noise.
Who could want more?

244
02:01:40,677 --> 02:01:45,034
Let's talk.
I need to tell you something.

245
02:01:48,317 --> 02:01:55,268
You know my father died. What you
don't know... is it was my fault.

246
02:01:55,437 --> 02:02:03,310
When he fell?
Honey, you were seven years old.

247
02:02:03,477 --> 02:02:10,394
I was hiding under the stairs.
My parents were arguing.

248
02:02:10,557 --> 02:02:13,629
There was this woman,
Robin Hayes.

249
02:02:13,797 --> 02:02:17,153
My father was leaving us
to be with her.

250
02:02:17,317 --> 02:02:20,593
My mom stormed out
and my father went after her.

251
02:02:20,757 --> 02:02:23,590
I charged in to save her.

252
02:02:26,997 --> 02:02:30,876
I went straight into him.

253
02:02:31,037 --> 02:02:33,995
He stumbled back
and lost his balance.

254
02:02:34,157 --> 02:02:37,672
The doors were open
to the basement stairs...

255
02:02:40,077 --> 02:02:43,194
...and he went down.

256
02:02:44,637 --> 02:02:51,076
I was screaming. It seemed like
forever before my mom heard me.

257
02:02:51,237 --> 02:02:56,789
She'd been pulling the boards off
the old shed I had for my kittens.

258
02:02:56,957 --> 02:03:00,632
She came in.
She had this look on her face.

259
02:03:00,797 --> 02:03:08,385
She was still holding
the nail puller and the tool basket.

260
02:03:08,557 --> 02:03:13,267
She dropped them
and they made this loud sound.

261
02:03:14,157 --> 02:03:20,187
Then she... hugged me tight.

262
02:03:21,797 --> 02:03:25,028
And said it was just an accident.

263
02:03:25,717 --> 02:03:28,675
She did.

264
02:03:29,757 --> 02:03:31,793
Baby...

265
02:03:33,397 --> 02:03:37,595
I hated him for the affair.

266
02:03:37,757 --> 02:03:40,988
The way he hurt her.

267
02:03:43,877 --> 02:03:46,596
But I still...

268
02:03:46,757 --> 02:03:48,873
...love him.

269
02:03:53,917 --> 02:03:59,310
You've been living with these ghosts
for so long. You should go home.

270
02:03:59,477 --> 02:04:03,629
We should. Face all those ghosts.

271
02:04:03,797 --> 02:04:07,836
Live in the home that you loved.
With your mother...

272
02:04:07,997 --> 02:04:11,228
...and me... and our daughter.

273
02:04:12,317 --> 02:04:16,868
And our daughter? Is there
something you're not telling me?

274
02:04:17,037 --> 02:04:21,155
I guess my hopes are showing.
It runs in the family.

275
02:04:30,557 --> 02:04:34,186
- Congratulations, Mr. Baring.
- You've done it.

276
02:05:08,237 --> 02:05:13,470
Dear God, thank you
for bringing my family home at last.

277
02:05:25,477 --> 02:05:28,992
- What happened to you?
- Don't ask.

278
02:05:32,837 --> 02:05:36,546
- Here.
- Oh, God.

279
02:05:37,157 --> 02:05:40,354
How do you really think
Helen is doing?

280
02:05:40,517 --> 02:05:45,068
- What do you mean?
- She just seems so...

281
02:05:45,237 --> 02:05:49,116
...delicate and fragile.
I worry about her.

282
02:05:50,597 --> 02:05:53,794
Every woman is different, but...

283
02:05:54,397 --> 02:05:57,389
Hell, I don't know how to say this.

284
02:05:57,557 --> 02:06:04,030
Sometimes during a pregnancy...
Turn around, honey.

285
02:06:04,197 --> 02:06:08,827
How to say it?
Sometimes during a pregnancy...

286
02:06:08,997 --> 02:06:14,867
...making love is uncomfortable
physically and emotionally, too.

287
02:06:15,037 --> 02:06:19,394
- Did she say something?
- It's...

288
02:06:19,557 --> 02:06:23,596
I just think you should
keep your distance a little.

289
02:06:26,757 --> 02:06:29,271
Mind your own business.

290
02:06:51,677 --> 02:06:54,145
Oh, my God!

291
02:07:04,997 --> 02:07:09,832
Are you all right?
I brought you some tea.

292
02:07:09,997 --> 02:07:13,785
It's herbal. Lemon verbena.
Very relaxing.

293
02:07:13,957 --> 02:07:18,906
It's almost like a drug.
I'm surprised it's legal. Here.

294
02:07:19,077 --> 02:07:23,275
- You gave us quite a scare.
- There were so many.

295
02:07:23,437 --> 02:07:26,349
It's the poison.
They go up into the rafters to die.

296
02:07:26,517 --> 02:07:31,750
It's painless, but it does
leave a lot of bodies around.

297
02:07:32,837 --> 02:07:37,353
- God!
- It's over now. You just relax.

298
02:07:39,077 --> 02:07:44,356
I feel so strange.
I don't know what's wrong with me.

299
02:07:45,957 --> 02:07:49,233
I know exactly how you feel.

300
02:07:50,397 --> 02:07:52,752
Your muscles ache.

301
02:07:52,917 --> 02:07:56,796
And your skin is so sensitive.

302
02:07:56,957 --> 02:08:02,748
And your mind...
that just goes haywire, doesn't it?

303
02:08:09,997 --> 02:08:17,153
Helen...
you are a lovely young woman.

304
02:08:17,317 --> 02:08:20,548
You just remember that...

305
02:08:20,717 --> 02:08:27,475
...no matter what
Jackson may say or do.

306
02:08:27,637 --> 02:08:35,396
Men can act strange during
a pregnancy. Sexually, I mean.

307
02:08:37,477 --> 02:08:44,747
My husband was devoted to me,
but while I was carrying Jackson...

308
02:08:45,797 --> 02:08:50,791
I think we'll be fine. I just think
we need some time to ourselves.

309
02:08:50,957 --> 02:08:54,472
Of course.

310
02:08:54,637 --> 02:09:01,554
- You will see Dr. Hill tomorrow?
- You know I don't want an amnio.

311
02:09:04,037 --> 02:09:08,189
Jackson was not my first pregnancy.

312
02:09:11,637 --> 02:09:15,186
- You had a miscarriage?
- No.

313
02:09:15,357 --> 02:09:20,272
We discovered some abnormalities.

314
02:09:20,437 --> 02:09:22,746
It was the right thing to do.

315
02:09:22,917 --> 02:09:28,753
She would have been
just about your age now.

316
02:09:30,117 --> 02:09:33,632
But I had to terminate
that pregnancy.

317
02:09:36,037 --> 02:09:40,428
- What abnormalities?
- Never mind.

318
02:09:40,597 --> 02:09:44,431
Go and see Dr. Hill. It's important.

319
02:09:48,197 --> 02:09:52,509
- Good night, darling.
- Good night.

320
02:09:52,677 --> 02:09:57,068
Would you send Jackson up, please?

321
02:10:02,077 --> 02:10:04,830
- How is she?
- She's fine.

322
02:10:04,997 --> 02:10:08,592
She just needs a little time alone.

323
02:10:08,757 --> 02:10:12,511
What's going on with her?

324
02:10:12,677 --> 02:10:15,714
You just have to be patient.

325
02:10:15,877 --> 02:10:20,632
Come on,
I'm going to buy you a drink.

326
02:11:10,477 --> 02:11:14,868
It seems your husband is the only
one getting any sleep around here.

327
02:11:16,437 --> 02:11:22,512
I tried to wake him, but he's gone.
Farm work will do that to you.

328
02:11:24,677 --> 02:11:31,389
- It's more than that.
- Are you two having problems?

329
02:11:31,557 --> 02:11:38,156
He's been different
since we've been down here.

330
02:11:38,317 --> 02:11:44,995
- He never got over his father.
- He's not the only one.

331
02:11:45,157 --> 02:11:51,710
But then Jackson and I have always
had each other to lean on.

332
02:11:51,877 --> 02:11:56,632
I don't have to tell you what
it's like to lose someone you love.

333
02:11:59,237 --> 02:12:03,025
Well, I was very young...
but I know.

334
02:12:07,077 --> 02:12:14,506
- Here's to accidents... fuck 'em.
- Amen.

335
02:12:25,957 --> 02:12:30,633
- He'll bring $500,000 in stud fees.
- Are you kidding?

336
02:12:30,797 --> 02:12:36,986
- Breeding is everything.
- Martha says you've been so weak.

337
02:12:37,157 --> 02:12:40,786
- I hope you don't lose that baby.
- Look, there's old Alice.

338
02:12:40,957 --> 02:12:44,745
I didn't think
she got out much, any more.

339
02:12:44,917 --> 02:12:50,833
- Helen, come and join us.
- Alice is here.

340
02:12:50,997 --> 02:12:55,434
- I don't see anyone.
- I'm going to say hello.

341
02:12:55,597 --> 02:12:59,670
- No, I forbid it.
- Excuse me?

342
02:12:59,837 --> 02:13:06,595
She's just a crazy old woman.
She doesn't deserve your attention.

343
02:13:06,757 --> 02:13:12,787
I haven't been <i>forbidden</i> to do
anything since I was five years old.

344
02:13:13,637 --> 02:13:16,356
Helen!

345
02:13:26,957 --> 02:13:30,632
- What happened? Are you all right?
- Yes.

346
02:13:30,797 --> 02:13:36,110
- You gave me such a scare.
- Why did you yell?

347
02:13:36,277 --> 02:13:41,954
- What the hell happened?
- She walked in front of the horse.

348
02:13:42,117 --> 02:13:45,666
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

349
02:13:47,877 --> 02:13:53,315
- Is it near the baby?
- No, it's at the other end.

350
02:13:53,477 --> 02:13:59,473
What's this I hear
about you having the baby at home?

351
02:14:01,477 --> 02:14:03,388
What?

352
02:14:03,557 --> 02:14:07,709
It's a romantic idea,
but too much can go wrong.

353
02:14:07,877 --> 02:14:13,474
Besides, I can't have you young
mothers cutting into my income.

354
02:14:13,637 --> 02:14:18,233
Dr. Hill, who told you that I wanted
to have the baby at home?

355
02:14:20,077 --> 02:14:23,308
Of course it was her.
It's so invasive.

356
02:14:23,477 --> 02:14:26,549
Is this my baby or is it hers?

357
02:14:26,717 --> 02:14:28,947
She knows him socially.

358
02:14:29,117 --> 02:14:33,349
But why is she telling him things
that I didn't say?

359
02:14:33,517 --> 02:14:36,748
She's just trying to be helpful.

360
02:14:36,917 --> 02:14:42,549
Give her a break,
it's for your own good. Isn't it?

361
02:14:42,717 --> 02:14:45,834
Yes, it's for my own good.
She's right...

362
02:14:45,997 --> 02:14:50,991
...and I'm always wrong. Thank you.

363
02:14:53,757 --> 02:14:56,794
What took you so long?

364
02:14:56,957 --> 02:15:01,872
Go on, spit it out...
you didn't come here for the food.

365
02:15:03,997 --> 02:15:08,673
- Can I ask you a question?
- Please do.

366
02:15:08,837 --> 02:15:14,753
You told me to be careful of Martha.
What did you mean by that?

367
02:15:14,917 --> 02:15:18,068
You mustn't pay any attention to me.

368
02:15:18,237 --> 02:15:21,274
I'm incompetent,
didn't she say that?

369
02:15:21,437 --> 02:15:26,067
And incontinent.
Sort of unreliable at both ends.

370
02:15:26,237 --> 02:15:30,947
Here, girls.
I feed them the whole pharmacy.

371
02:15:31,117 --> 02:15:35,474
Heartburn, ulcers, blood pressure.

372
02:15:35,637 --> 02:15:38,390
They're immune to everything now.

373
02:15:38,557 --> 02:15:41,833
The oldest living Confederates
in America.

374
02:15:41,997 --> 02:15:44,272
There you are, girls.

375
02:15:44,437 --> 02:15:49,272
Here's the thing. I don't
have anybody here to talk to.

376
02:15:49,437 --> 02:15:56,787
Well, I'm kind of busy right now,
but I believe I could fit you in.

377
02:15:56,957 --> 02:16:00,632
Ever since we moved back here...

378
02:16:00,797 --> 02:16:04,756
...Jackson is becoming
more and more distant.

379
02:16:04,917 --> 02:16:08,193
Distant from you, closer to her.

380
02:16:08,357 --> 02:16:12,748
- I think that...
- That you're losing him to Martha.

381
02:16:12,917 --> 02:16:16,193
You're right.
Why don't you say what you mean?

382
02:16:16,357 --> 02:16:21,112
- Maybe I'm just being paranoid.
- She was a stable girl.

383
02:16:21,277 --> 02:16:24,633
- She was?
- Shovelling horse shit.

384
02:16:24,797 --> 02:16:27,994
Not that I hold that against her.

385
02:16:28,157 --> 02:16:31,035
I admire her ambition.

386
02:16:31,197 --> 02:16:36,476
She got herself pregnant.
She got a husband and a son.

387
02:16:36,637 --> 02:16:39,595
And a fine family name.

388
02:16:39,757 --> 02:16:44,706
And now she's breeding herself
a grandson, isn't she?

389
02:16:50,557 --> 02:16:55,426
She never loved my son Jack.
All she ever wanted was that baby.

390
02:16:55,597 --> 02:16:59,033
After she had it,
she put my son out to pasture.

391
02:16:59,197 --> 02:17:05,067
She took Jackson and poisoned his
mind against his father... and me.

392
02:17:05,237 --> 02:17:11,153
- She'll do the same to you.
- I think she already has.

393
02:17:11,317 --> 02:17:14,832
She made a beautiful widow,
Martha did.

394
02:17:14,997 --> 02:17:18,433
So much more attractive
than a divorced woman.

395
02:17:18,597 --> 02:17:23,990
- Was Jack going to leave Martha?
- Nobody leaves Martha.

396
02:17:24,157 --> 02:17:26,671
Believe me.

397
02:17:28,077 --> 02:17:31,353
You bring Jackson to visit me.

398
02:17:31,517 --> 02:17:35,556
I'll tell him the truth
about his father.

399
02:17:35,717 --> 02:17:38,436
I'm his blood...

400
02:17:38,597 --> 02:17:41,828
...and I love him.

401
02:17:41,997 --> 02:17:46,275
You tell him that.

402
02:18:08,597 --> 02:18:15,469
Dr. Hill, this is Jackson Baring.
Have you seen Helen?

403
02:18:17,277 --> 02:18:22,226
Helen, where have you been?
We've been so worried.

404
02:18:22,397 --> 02:18:27,312
- Am I not to leave the property?
- She just appeared, Dr. Hill.

405
02:18:27,477 --> 02:18:33,791
Just tell us where you're going
so we know where you are.

406
02:18:33,957 --> 02:18:40,715
- Good night, Martha.
- Good night, dear.

407
02:19:07,837 --> 02:19:13,275
She's your grandmother.
She wants to see you. Come with me.

408
02:19:13,437 --> 02:19:19,751
Just go to sleep.
We'll talk about it in the morning.

409
02:19:32,397 --> 02:19:35,514
HOLYOKE RETIREMENT HOME

410
02:19:40,317 --> 02:19:44,469
Mrs. Baring, it's been a while.
Alice will be so pleased.

411
02:19:44,637 --> 02:19:50,553
- Where is she?
- She's having her steam treatment.

412
02:19:50,717 --> 02:19:53,868
Go on in.

413
02:20:03,677 --> 02:20:07,226
Martha, what a surprise.

414
02:20:07,397 --> 02:20:10,548
Go to my room. I'll be right out.

415
02:20:10,717 --> 02:20:16,474
- Who pays your bills here, Alice?
- You do, with the money Jack left.

416
02:20:17,317 --> 02:20:22,072
- Is it cheap here?
- I don't know...

417
02:20:22,237 --> 02:20:27,231
Cheap is something
you'd know more about than I would.

418
02:20:27,397 --> 02:20:32,391
- Is it cheap here?
- I suppose not.

419
02:20:32,557 --> 02:20:34,912
You suppose right.

420
02:20:35,077 --> 02:20:40,470
And what is the only thing
I have ever asked of you in return?

421
02:20:40,637 --> 02:20:43,834
What is it?

422
02:20:43,997 --> 02:20:50,550
That you stay away from my family.
That's all you have to do.

423
02:20:50,717 --> 02:20:56,155
Is that so much for a mother to ask?

424
02:20:56,317 --> 02:20:59,195
What did you tell her?

425
02:20:59,357 --> 02:21:04,306
What dirty little lies
did you tell her, Alice?

426
02:21:04,477 --> 02:21:08,356
Answer me.

427
02:21:11,517 --> 02:21:16,432
- Answer me.
- I am. You can't see my finger.

428
02:21:30,317 --> 02:21:35,345
Isn't time a terrible thing, Alice?

429
02:21:35,517 --> 02:21:38,589
Tick-tock...

430
02:21:38,757 --> 02:21:42,227
And look what happens.

431
02:21:49,557 --> 02:21:53,914
Are you going to behave, Alice?

432
02:21:54,077 --> 02:21:59,470
There's something I've wanted to
tell you since the day you arrived.

433
02:22:00,717 --> 02:22:03,914
You always smell of horse shit.

434
02:22:12,957 --> 02:22:16,267
Damn you, Martha!

435
02:22:17,877 --> 02:22:20,789
You stay away from my boy!

436
02:22:23,717 --> 02:22:27,915
Do you understand?

437
02:22:28,077 --> 02:22:32,787
I'll take that as a... yes.

438
02:22:38,237 --> 02:22:41,195
Goodbye, Alice.

439
02:22:57,117 --> 02:23:02,237
She wants a little more time.
She says it helps her joints.

440
02:23:02,397 --> 02:23:07,994
- I'll give her five more minutes.
- Make it ten.

441
02:23:43,637 --> 02:23:47,152
- We can't go on like this.
- Like what?

442
02:23:47,317 --> 02:23:52,471
I don't know what's going on
between us and your mother...

443
02:23:52,637 --> 02:23:58,473
I'm trying to be respectful of that,
but it's very difficult.

444
02:23:59,317 --> 02:24:05,313
I just... I love you.

445
02:24:05,477 --> 02:24:11,712
I really love you and I think we
need to be supportive of each other.

446
02:24:11,877 --> 02:24:16,155
Soon I'm going to be a mother...
and I need you.

447
02:24:21,757 --> 02:24:27,627
Even with modest bookings we should
soon be getting positive cash flow.

448
02:24:29,277 --> 02:24:31,347
You mean sell?

449
02:24:31,517 --> 02:24:36,796
Mom, look...
I can see Helen's not happy here.

450
02:24:38,877 --> 02:24:41,914
I want to take her back to New York.

451
02:24:46,597 --> 02:24:50,306
I'm not blaming you.
I'm not blaming anyone.

452
02:24:50,477 --> 02:24:55,267
I love her. She's my wife.
I want her to be happy.

453
02:24:57,517 --> 02:25:01,430
Things have been tense
between Helen and me.

454
02:25:01,597 --> 02:25:06,068
But I want you to know...
it's been all my fault.

455
02:25:07,837 --> 02:25:12,035
It's hard for two women
to share the same household.

456
02:25:12,197 --> 02:25:18,227
I can see that my ways bother her
and I'm truly sorry about that.

457
02:25:20,317 --> 02:25:23,787
But one thing I do know...

458
02:25:23,957 --> 02:25:28,075
We both want
that horse to win this weekend.

459
02:25:28,237 --> 02:25:32,071
Helen and I will pack everything
for my little grandson.

460
02:25:32,237 --> 02:25:34,228
Grandson?

461
02:25:34,397 --> 02:25:38,868
Listen, darling,
your first responsibility is to her.

462
02:25:39,037 --> 02:25:41,870
She's a wonderful girl
and I love her.

463
02:25:44,557 --> 02:25:47,435
What?

464
02:25:47,597 --> 02:25:51,476
Are you surprised your old mother
can be a human being?

465
02:25:51,637 --> 02:25:53,548
Well, yeah.

466
02:25:56,917 --> 02:26:00,626
But the truth?
I'm sorry to leave.

467
02:26:00,797 --> 02:26:03,231
Don't be.

468
02:26:03,397 --> 02:26:09,393
That wife of yours needs to go...
where she belongs.

469
02:26:29,797 --> 02:26:33,915
- Franklin.
- Martha.

470
02:26:34,077 --> 02:26:38,628
Do you know
I was just thinking about you.

471
02:26:38,957 --> 02:26:41,232
That's nice.

472
02:26:41,397 --> 02:26:46,994
This is not strictly by the books,
but could I ask you about Helen?

473
02:26:47,157 --> 02:26:51,275
She's so filled with anxieties,
I don't know what to do.

474
02:26:51,437 --> 02:26:56,227
It's all those books
on pregnancy she's reading.

475
02:26:56,397 --> 02:27:00,913
She's got it in her mind
that first babies are always late.

476
02:27:01,077 --> 02:27:07,107
If she's a week or two late, it's no
problem. We can induce right here.

477
02:27:07,277 --> 02:27:11,395
Oxytocin brings on contractions
within 24 hours.

478
02:27:11,557 --> 02:27:16,790
- We use that for horses.
- Yes, it's exactly the same.

479
02:27:16,957 --> 02:27:22,236
Whatever it is, we got the cure.
It's not like it was in our day.

480
02:27:22,397 --> 02:27:25,514
Can you believe it?
Me a grandmother.

481
02:27:25,677 --> 02:27:28,635
No, I can't.

482
02:27:28,797 --> 02:27:31,834
Tell me, is it a boy or a girl?

483
02:27:31,997 --> 02:27:34,875
You'll get me into trouble.

484
02:27:35,037 --> 02:27:39,553
I just want to get the colour right.
You know I hate yellow.

485
02:27:39,717 --> 02:27:43,392
- What colour do you like?
- Well...

486
02:27:43,557 --> 02:27:47,789
Blue was lucky for me 25 years ago.

487
02:27:47,957 --> 02:27:55,033
Why don't you play your hunch then?
Bye, Martha.

488
02:28:01,277 --> 02:28:05,156
O XYTOCIN

489
02:28:14,077 --> 02:28:16,830
Don't worry. I'll be here packing.

490
02:28:16,997 --> 02:28:21,275
- Are you sure you want me to go?
- I want you to go and win.

491
02:28:21,437 --> 02:28:25,589
Then get your ass back here
as fast as you can.

492
02:28:28,277 --> 02:28:34,068
It's more than three hours away and
you want to get there before dinner.

493
02:28:36,117 --> 02:28:39,712
Come on, you lovebirds,
he's already in the van.

494
02:28:39,877 --> 02:28:43,950
Goodbye, baby. Good luck.

495
02:28:44,117 --> 02:28:47,666
You take care, both of you.
I'll be back tomorrow night.

496
02:28:50,277 --> 02:28:54,190
- Bye.
- Bye.

497
02:28:57,877 --> 02:29:03,349
It won't be long before Kilronan
is everything it ever was.

498
02:29:03,517 --> 02:29:07,032
- Kind of a shame, isn't it?
- What is?

499
02:29:07,197 --> 02:29:11,395
That we won't be here to see it.

500
02:29:51,317 --> 02:29:56,345
- Hey!
- And the same hey to you, darling.

501
02:29:57,957 --> 02:30:02,553
You're looking even lovelier.

502
02:30:02,717 --> 02:30:05,470
I've brought you something.

503
02:30:05,637 --> 02:30:11,951
Kind of a head start
on baby pictures.

504
02:30:12,117 --> 02:30:16,633
This'll be a big hit around here.
These nuns love a foetus.

505
02:30:16,797 --> 02:30:21,951
- I came to say goodbye.
- Hello and goodbye?

506
02:30:23,037 --> 02:30:28,111
- We're going back to New York.
- Good for you.

507
02:30:29,837 --> 02:30:34,831
You're well rid of that woman.
Jackson shouldn't have come back.

508
02:30:34,997 --> 02:30:37,465
That was my idea.

509
02:30:37,637 --> 02:30:42,665
I thought he had to come back
and face all the ghosts.

510
02:30:42,837 --> 02:30:47,786
He still blames himself
for his father's death.

511
02:30:47,957 --> 02:30:53,873
No, his daddy fell on a tool that
was lying at the foot of the stairs.

512
02:30:54,037 --> 02:30:58,076
One of those things they use
to pull nails out of boards.

513
02:30:58,237 --> 02:31:03,152
He landed on it just wrong
and it crushed his sternum.

514
02:31:03,317 --> 02:31:08,072
It was in all the newspapers.
Doctors commenting right and left.

515
02:31:08,237 --> 02:31:13,186
A bizarre happening.
Jackson must accept that.

516
02:31:13,357 --> 02:31:19,353
Be careful, now. When Jack told her
he was leaving, she turned demonic.

517
02:31:20,557 --> 02:31:25,073
I can see that.
She strikes me as the jealous type.

518
02:31:25,237 --> 02:31:29,628
What possible reason could she have
to be jealous of Jack?

519
02:31:31,477 --> 02:31:36,426
Didn't he ever tell you
about Robin Hayes?

520
02:31:36,597 --> 02:31:42,866
Jack and Robin? Walk me.
These old farts shock easily.

521
02:31:58,077 --> 02:32:04,630
- What?
- Oh...

522
02:32:04,797 --> 02:32:10,110
I was just remembering
when I had Jackson.

523
02:32:10,277 --> 02:32:15,146
I thought that pain
was going to rip me in half.

524
02:32:15,317 --> 02:32:17,706
How stupid of me.

525
02:32:17,877 --> 02:32:24,191
Oh, Honey... here.
Let me get you some dessert.

526
02:32:24,357 --> 02:32:29,477
- I'm tired. I'm going upstairs.
- I made it specially for you.

527
02:32:29,637 --> 02:32:32,515
It's strawberries, your favourite.

528
02:32:32,677 --> 02:32:38,627
Indulge yourself. Go on, take it.

529
02:32:38,797 --> 02:32:42,506
You deserve it.

530
02:32:44,917 --> 02:32:48,512
- I think I'll take it up to bed.
- Yes.

531
02:32:48,677 --> 02:32:53,626
Go on. That baby needs
all the rest he can get.

532
02:32:55,117 --> 02:32:56,994
Or she.

533
02:32:58,957 --> 02:33:02,188
- Or she.
- Good night, Martha.

534
02:33:02,357 --> 02:33:05,793
Sweet dreams.

535
02:33:17,397 --> 02:33:24,235
Tender around that joint.
I'll wrap it.

536
02:33:30,837 --> 02:33:36,434
My God, I am heartily sorry for
offending thee. I detest my sins.

537
02:33:36,597 --> 02:33:40,431
Most of all because
they offend thee, my God -

538
02:33:40,597 --> 02:33:44,749
- who sent me a daughter-in-law
from the land of the Moabites.

539
02:33:44,917 --> 02:33:50,275
I will go with you, she said
and your people will be my people.

540
02:33:50,437 --> 02:33:56,069
She laid on the threshing floor and
did as her mother-in-law instructed.

541
02:33:57,557 --> 02:34:00,435
<i>And she conceived a son.</i>

542
02:34:00,597 --> 02:34:06,035
<i>And God said he will be born</i>
<i>and renew your life.</i>

543
02:34:06,197 --> 02:34:12,272
<i>He is born of your daughter-in-law</i>
<i>and is better than seven sons.</i>

544
02:34:12,437 --> 02:34:16,908
<i>You understand, don't you?</i>
<i>This is for him...</i>

545
02:34:17,077 --> 02:34:23,107
<i>... and the precious baby who has</i>
<i>no one to protect him from her.</i>

546
02:34:24,237 --> 02:34:29,630
Hey, are you kicking me again?

547
02:34:29,797 --> 02:34:36,145
<i>He is weak... my son.</i>
<i>I am his strength.</i>

548
02:34:37,077 --> 02:34:39,637
Are you hungry?

549
02:34:39,797 --> 02:34:45,394
<i>And God said let the woman</i>
<i>of emptiness become full.</i>

550
02:34:45,557 --> 02:34:49,630
<i>And you who are most worthy</i> - 

551
02:34:49,797 --> 02:34:55,667
- <i>shall take the child to your</i>
<i>bosom and become its mother.</i>

552
02:34:55,837 --> 02:35:00,513
And the women neighbours
will give him a name -

553
02:35:00,677 --> 02:35:04,795
- saying, a son is born to you.

554
02:35:04,957 --> 02:35:08,029
To you.

555
02:35:10,517 --> 02:35:19,471
I firmly resolve to confess my sins,
do penance and amend my life.

556
02:35:19,637 --> 02:35:21,832
Amen.

557
02:36:54,677 --> 02:36:57,430
Martha?

558
02:37:49,317 --> 02:37:53,435
- No, no...
- Helen!

559
02:37:58,117 --> 02:38:02,110
You bad girl, you!
You found me out, didn't you?

560
02:38:04,797 --> 02:38:10,633
- I saw a light.
- Is there no stopping you?

561
02:38:10,797 --> 02:38:16,110
What is all this?
What are you doing?

562
02:38:16,277 --> 02:38:21,067
It was my surprise for you, honey.

563
02:38:21,237 --> 02:38:24,707
- Surprise?
- I set it all up like this.

564
02:38:24,877 --> 02:38:29,905
It's for you. I was going
to ship it up to you in New York.

565
02:38:33,237 --> 02:38:37,071
I just thought the presentation
would be so vivid.

566
02:38:40,557 --> 02:38:45,392
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right, honey.

567
02:38:45,557 --> 02:38:49,311
We can still show it to Jackson.

568
02:38:49,477 --> 02:38:54,392
- Won't that be fun?
- Yes.

569
02:38:54,557 --> 02:39:00,746
- Are you all right?
- I'm just tired.

570
02:39:00,917 --> 02:39:08,426
Let me take you back up to the house
to bed. You've no shoes on.

571
02:39:19,757 --> 02:39:24,706
- Wait.
- What is it? Is it the baby?

572
02:39:24,877 --> 02:39:28,426
- Could I have some water?
- We're almost at the house.

573
02:39:28,597 --> 02:39:31,316
I need some water.

574
02:39:33,557 --> 02:39:36,196
All right, I'll be right back.

575
02:40:56,157 --> 02:41:00,275
Howdy. What can I do you for today,
my pretty lady?

576
02:41:01,157 --> 02:41:03,352
<i>Pretty lady...</i>

577
02:41:03,517 --> 02:41:06,429
<i>I know where you live.</i>

578
02:41:09,037 --> 02:41:11,346
My God!

579
02:41:11,517 --> 02:41:14,156
Just trying to be friendly, darling.

580
02:41:16,917 --> 02:41:18,873
Goddamn!

581
02:42:52,277 --> 02:42:55,269
What on earth are you doing?

582
02:43:00,077 --> 02:43:04,514
Do you think you're some alley cat
dropping your litter by the road?

583
02:43:20,037 --> 02:43:23,632
The pain is terrible, isn't it?

584
02:43:23,797 --> 02:43:27,915
Darling, I can feel it myself.
I can feel what you're feeling.

585
02:43:28,077 --> 02:43:33,356
- My God, help me.
- I wish I could.

586
02:43:33,517 --> 02:43:37,396
Believe me, I wish I could
give you something...

587
02:43:37,557 --> 02:43:40,788
...but I can't.

588
02:43:40,957 --> 02:43:44,552
You just have to go through it...

589
02:43:44,717 --> 02:43:49,029
...and feel it deeply.

590
02:43:49,197 --> 02:43:55,875
Then you will never forget
what your child means to you.

591
02:44:03,357 --> 02:44:05,473
I'm begging you.

592
02:44:09,717 --> 02:44:12,675
Well...

593
02:44:27,037 --> 02:44:32,236
This is the big one, isn't it?
I've put a couple of C-notes on him.

594
02:44:32,397 --> 02:44:35,833
I sent a buyer up to Kilronan
the other day.

595
02:44:35,997 --> 02:44:38,636
Martha told him you were staying.

596
02:44:38,797 --> 02:44:42,836
She did?

597
02:44:44,077 --> 02:44:49,310
It's almost over. Breathe, darling.

598
02:44:49,477 --> 02:44:54,392
It's okay, you're all right.
Breathe, Helen.

599
02:44:59,357 --> 02:45:03,270
Hello?
Jackson, I was hoping it was you.

600
02:45:06,277 --> 02:45:11,226
- Of course everything's all right.
- Can I talk to her?

601
02:45:11,397 --> 02:45:14,594
She's right here, just a minute.

602
02:45:14,837 --> 02:45:19,547
- <i>How did the morning workout go?</i>
- Jackson!

603
02:45:19,717 --> 02:45:23,392
- Great. He's running well.
- Did you draw your post position?

604
02:45:23,557 --> 02:45:28,187
Yes. Can I please talk to Helen?

605
02:45:28,477 --> 02:45:33,949
Jackson, I'm losing you.
I can't hear you any more.

606
02:45:48,077 --> 02:45:53,390
You're doing good.
Push a little bit harder. Push!

607
02:45:53,557 --> 02:45:57,596
- Push!
- I am pushing, you bitch!

608
02:45:57,757 --> 02:46:02,751
They're at the post.
The flag is up.

609
02:46:05,717 --> 02:46:10,188
One last time. Push down.
Push, Helen, push!

610
02:46:10,357 --> 02:46:16,512
You can do it. Come on, push.

611
02:46:16,677 --> 02:46:20,909
I can see it. Oh, my God!

612
02:46:21,077 --> 02:46:25,275
It's coming. Push, Helen.

613
02:46:32,357 --> 02:46:34,917
Yes...

614
02:46:40,757 --> 02:46:46,354
Push, Helen. Don't you quit now.

615
02:46:46,517 --> 02:46:52,035
My God! It's a beautiful little boy.

616
02:46:53,197 --> 02:46:56,633
He looks just like Jackson.

617
02:47:01,037 --> 02:47:05,030
- What a beautiful boy.
- Give him to me.

618
02:47:05,197 --> 02:47:09,190
Mama's going to get you
all cleaned up.

619
02:47:10,437 --> 02:47:13,349
No, Martha, give me my baby!

620
02:47:13,517 --> 02:47:16,793
I'll love you, dear.

621
02:47:16,957 --> 02:47:20,791
I'll love you
till China and Africa meet...

622
02:47:20,957 --> 02:47:25,906
...and the river jumps over
the mountains.

623
02:47:34,877 --> 02:47:38,836
Helen, you're losing so much blood.

624
02:47:38,997 --> 02:47:42,433
Look at the mess you've made
of my linens.

625
02:47:48,117 --> 02:47:52,508
I really wanted us
to be a family together.

626
02:47:52,677 --> 02:47:57,546
Really I did... but I don't know
if that's possible any more.

627
02:48:00,357 --> 02:48:08,913
It's a pity... but you were so weak
during your pregnancy.

628
02:48:09,077 --> 02:48:14,595
And you would insist on having
that baby right here at home.

629
02:48:16,197 --> 02:48:18,950
I did my best, you know I did.

630
02:48:20,917 --> 02:48:24,671
Of course, you won't remember it
that way, will you?

631
02:48:24,837 --> 02:48:29,865
You'll tell them all sorts of things
about me. Make up stories.

632
02:48:36,877 --> 02:48:39,266
MORPHINE

633
02:48:39,437 --> 02:48:43,589
It's dangerous to take
more than just a drop of this.

634
02:48:46,677 --> 02:48:51,114
Jackson and I will raise that baby
the way he deserves.

635
02:48:52,797 --> 02:48:54,469
I'm home.

636
02:48:54,637 --> 02:48:58,391
You'd have been proud.

637
02:49:04,277 --> 02:49:08,156
Mom.

638
02:49:09,517 --> 02:49:11,906
I'll be right there.

639
02:49:14,717 --> 02:49:18,505
Helen...
I've been calling and calling.

640
02:49:25,357 --> 02:49:27,427
It's a boy.

641
02:49:27,597 --> 02:49:33,308
He came so fast.
I had no time to call anybody.

642
02:49:33,477 --> 02:49:38,267
Your wife was so brave and
so strong. She needs to sleep now.

643
02:49:38,437 --> 02:49:42,988
You have no idea
what she's been through today.

644
02:49:43,157 --> 02:49:46,786
- Don't you want to hold your son?
- Is she okay?

645
02:49:46,957 --> 02:49:49,391
Helen's doing just great.

646
02:49:49,557 --> 02:49:55,154
You come with me. We've got to give
this baby boy his first bath.

647
02:49:57,317 --> 02:50:02,027
She's fine. She just needs to sleep.

648
02:50:47,317 --> 02:50:50,514
Hey, Mom.

649
02:50:50,677 --> 02:50:57,355
You can't sleep in this chair.
Go to bed. I'll keep watch.

650
02:50:57,517 --> 02:51:02,386
Thanks, Mom... not a chance.
I want to be here when she wakes up.

651
02:51:02,557 --> 02:51:07,108
I wouldn't miss it for the world.
I don't care about kinks in my neck.

652
02:51:07,277 --> 02:51:12,146
Your wife and baby are going
to need you at full strength.

653
02:51:12,317 --> 02:51:16,356
- Thank for seeing her through this.
- To bed now.

654
02:51:16,517 --> 02:51:21,511
March.
I won't take no for an answer.

655
02:51:21,677 --> 02:51:24,555
Shut up, Mom.
Quit while you're ahead.

656
02:51:27,597 --> 02:51:30,316
Good night.

657
02:51:58,157 --> 02:52:00,625
Hi, Mommy.

658
02:52:01,677 --> 02:52:05,192
Want to meet your little baby boy?

659
02:52:12,757 --> 02:52:15,396
This is your mommy.

660
02:52:26,357 --> 02:52:29,986
- How are you feeling?
- Okay.

661
02:52:31,557 --> 02:52:35,948
- Where's Martha?
- I think she's asleep.

662
02:52:36,117 --> 02:52:40,030
She said you really went through it.

663
02:52:40,197 --> 02:52:46,147
- Thank God she was here.
- Yeah.

664
02:52:46,317 --> 02:52:49,195
Honey, will you do me a favour?

665
02:52:49,357 --> 02:52:54,989
- Ask her to make us some breakfast.
- You're hungry... that's good.

666
02:53:01,877 --> 02:53:06,109
If you need anything,
I'll be downstairs.

667
02:53:22,197 --> 02:53:24,836
There you are... Daddy.

668
02:53:26,957 --> 02:53:30,791
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

669
02:53:30,957 --> 02:53:34,666
- You've been outside.
- I was looking for something.

670
02:53:36,237 --> 02:53:44,155
- You really ought to be in bed.
- I feel wonderful, Martha.

671
02:53:44,317 --> 02:53:49,471
I slept so deeply. It's like
I was drugged or something.

672
02:53:49,637 --> 02:53:53,346
- It's like 20 years passed.
- It has.

673
02:53:53,517 --> 02:53:57,305
- We just forgot to tell you.
- Great.

674
02:53:57,477 --> 02:54:03,074
- What's in the bag?
- This thing I found in the barn.

675
02:54:04,077 --> 02:54:07,114
Those eggs smell good.

676
02:54:10,397 --> 02:54:14,709
- What?
- What yourself. What's the mystery?

677
02:54:14,877 --> 02:54:20,076
This is such a happy day. I don't
want to bring everybody down.

678
02:54:20,237 --> 02:54:25,391
Come on, Baby, don't keep us all
in suspense. What's in the bag?

679
02:54:25,637 --> 02:54:29,312
It's one of those things
that killed Jackson's daddy.

680
02:54:29,477 --> 02:54:35,029
- I'd never seen one before.
- What are you talking about?

681
02:54:35,197 --> 02:54:38,826
Jackson has a son of his own now.

682
02:54:38,997 --> 02:54:42,467
He's got to let go
of all those old ghosts.

683
02:54:42,637 --> 02:54:46,471
I had to find one of these things.

684
02:54:46,637 --> 02:54:52,507
Now I'll bury it in the ground,
so it never harms this family again.

685
02:54:52,677 --> 02:54:58,070
- I know that sounds hormonal...
- My father fell down the stairs.

686
02:54:58,237 --> 02:55:01,195
It wasn't the fall that killed him.

687
02:55:01,357 --> 02:55:07,432
Downstairs, your mama found
that he had fallen on this thing.

688
02:55:07,597 --> 02:55:12,796
It was a freak accident.
It was even in the newspapers.

689
02:55:12,957 --> 02:55:17,587
He fell on something
at the bottom of the stairs?

690
02:55:17,757 --> 02:55:22,911
Helen's right, this is not the day
we should be talking about this.

691
02:55:23,077 --> 02:55:26,035
Yeah, he fell. He fell on this.

692
02:55:29,157 --> 02:55:33,947
There must be lots of these
laying round a place like this.

693
02:55:34,117 --> 02:55:39,987
- What are you doing?
- Whatever do you mean?

694
02:55:40,157 --> 02:55:46,312
That's how Jack died. He fell
with inconceivable precision.

695
02:55:46,477 --> 02:55:51,915
This tool killed him as surely as if
it had been smashed into his body.

696
02:55:54,677 --> 02:55:59,353
- You were working on that shed.
- How could you remember that?

697
02:55:59,517 --> 02:56:01,667
You were only seven.

698
02:56:01,837 --> 02:56:05,512
I remember particularly you
holding that when you hugged me.

699
02:56:05,677 --> 02:56:11,673
When you dropped it, it made
this really loud clanging sound.

700
02:56:13,557 --> 02:56:19,109
Why are you doing this?
Trying to tear my family apart.

701
02:56:19,277 --> 02:56:22,553
- You lost your own parents...
- Mom, she wasn't...

702
02:56:22,717 --> 02:56:27,313
She's not fooling anybody.
Do you know what she's implying?

703
02:56:27,477 --> 02:56:33,393
If I did hold one of those things,
it wasn't the only one we had.

704
02:56:33,557 --> 02:56:39,348
You remember that day.
You remember the fall.

705
02:56:39,517 --> 02:56:43,476
That fall
could have killed anybody who...

706
02:56:43,637 --> 02:56:49,587
Martha! No one's implying
that you killed Jack!

707
02:56:49,757 --> 02:56:55,195
Lots of wives have affairs
and don't kill their husbands.

708
02:56:55,357 --> 02:56:59,350
- My father was having the affair.
- No, he wasn't.

709
02:56:59,517 --> 02:57:05,114
Robin Hayes was a wrangler that
Martha was having an affair with.

710
02:57:05,277 --> 02:57:08,826
Alice told you that, did she?

711
02:57:08,997 --> 02:57:12,546
That's just the kind of twisted lie
Alice would invent.

712
02:57:12,717 --> 02:57:17,029
Now your wife's trying
to use it against me.

713
02:57:18,797 --> 02:57:22,028
I just talked to Robin Hayes
half an hour ago.

714
02:57:22,197 --> 02:57:26,475
- Would you like to speak to him?
- No!

715
02:57:27,157 --> 02:57:32,106
Robin Hayes died last year of a
heart attack, one you didn't cause.

716
02:57:33,517 --> 02:57:39,956
You just couldn't bear to let
a happy family be, could you?

717
02:57:40,957 --> 02:57:45,633
We were so close
to being happy, Jackson.

718
02:57:45,797 --> 02:57:49,028
Here's how close we were.

719
02:57:51,717 --> 02:57:56,586
- She tried to kill me last night.
- That's a lie.

720
02:57:56,757 --> 02:58:01,990
Your father was leaving.
That's why she killed him.

721
02:58:02,157 --> 02:58:05,115
She made you think that you did it -

722
02:58:05,277 --> 02:58:09,270
- so that she could bind you to her
for the rest of your life.

723
02:58:09,437 --> 02:58:13,828
I want you to throw this lying bitch
out of my house.

724
02:58:13,997 --> 02:58:16,989
Yeah, there's already one of those.

725
02:58:17,157 --> 02:58:20,832
- You'll never prove anything.
- She doesn't have to.

726
02:58:24,037 --> 02:58:27,074
- Jackson, you can't...
- Shut up!

727
02:58:29,517 --> 02:58:32,077
Everything about you is a lie.

728
02:58:32,237 --> 02:58:36,628
This place and everything in it
will be sold.

729
02:58:36,797 --> 02:58:41,029
You will never see me
or any member of my family again.

730
02:58:43,357 --> 02:58:46,315
But I did it all for you.

731
02:58:46,477 --> 02:58:49,708
You are not my mother.

732
02:58:57,397 --> 02:59:01,151
You did this. You tricked him.

733
02:59:01,317 --> 02:59:05,754
You got yourself pregnant.
I know what you're after.

734
02:59:05,917 --> 02:59:12,356
You want my farm, my land, my boy!

735
02:59:12,917 --> 02:59:18,594
You want to take everything I have.
Don't you see what she's doing?

736
02:59:20,837 --> 02:59:23,795
She wants to be me.

737
02:59:34,517 --> 02:59:36,747
So long, Martha.

738
03:00:18,957 --> 03:00:22,267
Grandma.
