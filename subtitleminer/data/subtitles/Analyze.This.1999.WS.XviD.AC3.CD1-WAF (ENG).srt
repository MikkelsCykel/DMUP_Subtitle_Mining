00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,872
1957 was a big year.

2
00:00:50,128 --> 00:00:52,701
The Russians put that Sputnik
into outer space.

3
00:00:52,964 --> 00:00:55,800
The Dodgers played their last game
at Ebbets Field...

4
00:00:56,051 --> 00:00:57,462
...and said goodbye to Brooklyn.

5
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:01,385
That guy, he shot Frank Costello
in the head and missed.

6
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:05,804
The Gallo brothers whacked
Albert Anastasia in that barbershop.

7
00:01:06,061 --> 00:01:07,853
It was total chaos.

8
00:01:08,105 --> 00:01:11,688
With Anastasia out, Vito Genovese
figures he's the big boss.

9
00:01:12,109 --> 00:01:13,105
But Carlo Gambino...

10
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,567
...and Joe Bananas had other ideas.

11
00:01:15,905 --> 00:01:17,363
So they called a meeting.

12
00:01:17,823 --> 00:01:19,317
A big meeting.

13
00:01:29,335 --> 00:01:33,202
It was the first time the whole
Commission would meet face to face.

14
00:01:33,464 --> 00:01:36,335
Bosses and wiseguys were coming
from all over the country...

15
00:01:36,592 --> 00:01:38,550
...and all the
New York families too.

16
00:01:38,803 --> 00:01:41,341
Maybe 50 bosses,
the whole wiseguy world...

17
00:01:41,598 --> 00:01:44,433
...all coming to this
little town upstate.

18
00:01:54,235 --> 00:01:57,604
My father went with Dom Manetta
and Tommy D. Fat Tommy.

19
00:01:57,864 --> 00:01:59,489
He was running the family then.

20
00:01:59,741 --> 00:02:03,525
Some asshole thought it would be
a good idea to have this meeting...

21
00:02:03,787 --> 00:02:06,990
...at Joe Barbara 's farm,
up in the country, nice and quiet.

22
00:02:07,249 --> 00:02:08,624
Get away from the car.

23
00:02:11,503 --> 00:02:14,872
Want to be a fucking rib eye?
Get away from the car!

24
00:02:16,508 --> 00:02:19,628
Turns out the cops were
watching Joe Barbara like a hawk...

25
00:02:19,887 --> 00:02:24,134
...and some deputy sheriff notices
all the traffic and calls the feds.

26
00:02:37,029 --> 00:02:38,737
The meeting never even
got started.

27
00:02:38,989 --> 00:02:40,400
The feds moved in...

28
00:02:41,284 --> 00:02:43,905
...and bingo, the bosses,
they moved out.

29
00:03:02,555 --> 00:03:07,550
My father and Dominic, they hid out
in the field with some hay or corn.

30
00:03:07,769 --> 00:03:08,932
Along comes a farmer.

31
00:03:09,145 --> 00:03:12,349
Dominic bullshits him
while my father holds out...

32
00:03:12,607 --> 00:03:16,391
... this .44 cannon he used to carry,
and hijacked the tractor.

33
00:03:17,821 --> 00:03:20,490
The story is they drove it
to Bensonhurst...

34
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:24,275
...but my father told me they
only got as far as Poughkeepsie.

35
00:03:28,248 --> 00:03:30,620
Anyway, Carlo Gambino came out of it...

36
00:03:30,876 --> 00:03:33,034
. . .capo di tutti capi,
"boss of all bosses"...

37
00:03:33,295 --> 00:03:37,589
...and that was the last time the
Commission tried to meet, until now.

38
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:49,853
I don't like it.
What do we gotta meet for?

39
00:03:50,104 --> 00:03:53,058
Let everybody else worry about
their own business.

40
00:03:53,315 --> 00:03:57,645
The '57 meeting was about how we were
gonna divide this country.

41
00:03:58,154 --> 00:04:00,989
This meeting is how we're
gonna survive.

42
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:06,115
You got made guys
informing for the feds.

43
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:07,533
Bosses are going to jail.

44
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:10,912
People are getting whacked
without permission.

45
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:13,290
And on top of everything else. . .

46
00:04:13,544 --> 00:04:15,087
. . .you got these Chinese. . .

47
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:17,877
. . .and these crazy Russians
to deal with.

48
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:19,840
Everything's changing.

49
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:22,675
We gotta change with the times.

50
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:24,963
We gonna get a fucking Website?

51
00:04:25,222 --> 00:04:26,550
When your papa died. . .

52
00:04:29,268 --> 00:04:32,851
. . .I made him a promise
that I'd always look out for you.

53
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:37,395
I want you to come to
that meeting with me.

54
00:04:37,818 --> 00:04:38,899
Capisci?

55
00:04:47,955 --> 00:04:52,201
Listen. This guy, Primo Sindone,
you watch out for him.

56
00:04:52,501 --> 00:04:54,161
He's a scumbag.

57
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:56,086
Keep your eye on him, okay?

58
00:05:00,843 --> 00:05:02,717
Let me get a toothpick.
I'll be back.

59
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:34,374
Ijust kept telling him
that I needed room...

60
00:05:34,627 --> 00:05:35,706
. . .to grow. . .

61
00:05:37,963 --> 00:05:41,332
. . .and to find myself as a person.

62
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:44,255
You know?
Not just as a woman. . .

63
00:05:44,721 --> 00:05:47,128
. . .but as an independent entity.

64
00:05:47,974 --> 00:05:51,260
Then I told him I needed to get
in touch with my uniqueness. . .

65
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:53,725
. . .but he could not handle that.

66
00:05:54,605 --> 00:05:56,978
He said that I was
driving him away.

67
00:05:57,274 --> 00:06:00,276
He said I was driving him away.

68
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:05,074
Do you think I was
driving him away, Dr. Sobel?

69
00:06:07,368 --> 00:06:08,911
Caroline, things end.

70
00:06:09,997 --> 00:06:13,580
It's part of life. It's how we deal
with the ending that's important.

71
00:06:13,834 --> 00:06:15,031
I just cannot believe. . .

72
00:06:15,294 --> 00:06:18,046
. . .that it's over between
me and Steve, you know?

73
00:06:18,297 --> 00:06:20,502
I mean, maybe there's still hope.

74
00:06:21,091 --> 00:06:23,214
He took a restraining
order against you.

75
00:06:23,468 --> 00:06:25,841
To be honest,
that's usually not a good sign.

76
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:28,221
But what should I do?

77
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:34,426
The first thing that I think
you should do. . .

78
00:06:34,772 --> 00:06:38,686
. . .is to stop whining about this
pathetic loser, for chrissakes!

79
00:06:38,943 --> 00:06:40,568
You are a tragedy queen!

80
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:43,525
Steve doesn't like me.
Steve doesn't respect me.

81
00:06:43,781 --> 00:06:45,856
Who gives a shit?
Get a fucking life!

82
00:06:48,453 --> 00:06:50,160
Dr. Sobel?

83
00:06:55,377 --> 00:06:57,416
I was reflecting on your situation.

84
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:59,793
It's interesting what
you were saying.

85
00:07:00,048 --> 00:07:01,507
I want you to think about it.

86
00:07:02,259 --> 00:07:04,049
And I'm going to think about it.

87
00:07:04,302 --> 00:07:05,678
We'll both think about it. . .

88
00:07:07,889 --> 00:07:10,759
. . .and continue next week
when I get back from vacation.

89
00:07:14,855 --> 00:07:16,396
Caroline, what are you feeling?

90
00:07:16,647 --> 00:07:19,222
You're just like Steve.
You just want to--

91
00:07:19,485 --> 00:07:20,860
You just want to. . .

92
00:07:21,111 --> 00:07:22,818
. . .get rid of me
and throw me out.

93
00:07:23,072 --> 00:07:24,648
You know that's not true.

94
00:07:24,907 --> 00:07:25,901
Yes, it's true.

95
00:07:26,157 --> 00:07:27,568
I'll see you next week. . .

96
00:07:27,826 --> 00:07:30,317
. . .whereas Steve never wants
to see you again.

97
00:07:40,005 --> 00:07:41,168
Please, Mr. Vitti.

98
00:07:41,424 --> 00:07:43,297
I don't know nothing.
They don't believe me. . .

99
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:46,303
. . .because once I said Joe
hit Dukey and he didn't.

100
00:07:46,553 --> 00:07:49,340
I didn't know because Little Joe
looked like--

101
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:50,927
Shut the fuck up!

102
00:07:53,186 --> 00:07:54,596
You know me, right?

103
00:07:54,854 --> 00:07:55,802
You're Mr. Vitti.

104
00:07:56,063 --> 00:07:58,021
You know what I'll
do to you if you lie?

105
00:07:58,524 --> 00:08:01,360
You'll crack me on the head
with that pipe.

106
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:03,983
It's a rhetorical question,
you idiot.

107
00:08:04,239 --> 00:08:06,811
I'll ask you only once:
Who killed Dominic?

108
00:08:07,074 --> 00:08:08,652
-Who killed Dominic?
-I don't know!

109
00:08:08,909 --> 00:08:10,950
-Who killed Dominic?
-I don't know!

110
00:08:11,245 --> 00:08:12,159
I swear to God--

111
00:08:12,414 --> 00:08:13,528
Don't fucking lie!

112
00:08:13,789 --> 00:08:16,032
You little motherfucker!
Who killed Dom?

113
00:08:26,553 --> 00:08:28,462
He don't know nothing.
Forget it.

114
00:08:35,311 --> 00:08:37,103
That was relatively painless.

115
00:08:37,356 --> 00:08:38,304
Shut the fuck up!

116
00:08:39,191 --> 00:08:40,436
That hurt.

117
00:08:42,903 --> 00:08:44,278
We're not going anywhere.

118
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:47,531
We've sat here for 1 0 minutes.
I hate being late.

119
00:08:47,783 --> 00:08:49,573
I hate walking into
that house late.

120
00:08:49,826 --> 00:08:50,691
Dad, relax.

121
00:08:51,036 --> 00:08:54,203
You're like this because you're
mad we have to go to Grandpa's.

122
00:08:54,457 --> 00:08:55,998
Please don't analyze me.

123
00:08:56,249 --> 00:08:59,618
I can't be analyzed by somebody who,
until recently, believed in Santa.

124
00:08:59,878 --> 00:09:02,630
There is one Dr. Sobel
in this family. Just one.

125
00:09:03,466 --> 00:09:06,586
But there's two.
There's you and there's Grandpa.

126
00:09:07,637 --> 00:09:10,092
You know what?
Let's talk about something else.

127
00:09:12,266 --> 00:09:14,259
You gonna read
Grandpa's new book?

128
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,975
Mom says you won't
because you're jealous.

129
00:09:18,273 --> 00:09:22,483
Does your mother talk about anything
else, or is it just me, 24 hours a day?

130
00:09:22,735 --> 00:09:23,684
Shit!

131
00:09:24,195 --> 00:09:27,315
This is your mother's fault.
She knows where I am every second.

132
00:09:31,953 --> 00:09:33,116
Get in!

133
00:09:33,371 --> 00:09:36,076
If I point to you,
make believe your neck hurts.

134
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:38,038
What are you, a moron?

135
00:09:38,335 --> 00:09:39,959
I'm sorry.
This was my fault.

136
00:09:40,212 --> 00:09:41,242
Did you see anything?

137
00:09:41,505 --> 00:09:43,047
-I was talking to my son.
-Bullshit!

138
00:09:43,298 --> 00:09:44,413
That's all right, sir.

139
00:09:44,675 --> 00:09:47,082
It's our fault for
being in front of you.

140
00:09:47,343 --> 00:09:48,719
No, really.
Listen to me.

141
00:09:48,971 --> 00:09:51,840
I'm responsible.
Here's my insurance information.

142
00:09:52,099 --> 00:09:53,130
It's okay.
Forget it.

143
00:09:53,392 --> 00:09:55,219
Forget--?
Your rear end's screwed up.

144
00:09:56,311 --> 00:09:58,470
No, it was like that before.

145
00:10:00,149 --> 00:10:02,141
Let's call the police
and file a report.

146
00:10:02,818 --> 00:10:04,443
Fuck the police.

147
00:10:05,029 --> 00:10:05,859
Hear me?

148
00:10:08,032 --> 00:10:09,656
Okay.
Fuck them.

149
00:10:10,367 --> 00:10:11,945
You're right.
Fuck them.

150
00:10:12,203 --> 00:10:15,572
Especially those mounted cops
who leave big piles all over. . .

151
00:10:15,831 --> 00:10:18,157
. . .and you just step in it
up to your shins.

152
00:10:18,459 --> 00:10:19,953
Let me give you my card. . .

153
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:22,831
. . .in case you look at it
and change your mind.

154
00:10:23,256 --> 00:10:24,205
You a doctor?

155
00:10:25,049 --> 00:10:26,330
I'm a psychiatrist.

156
00:10:26,591 --> 00:10:27,541
A shrink.

157
00:10:28,009 --> 00:10:29,634
I talked to a shrink one time.

158
00:10:29,887 --> 00:10:32,260
When I got sent upstate on a. . .

159
00:10:32,515 --> 00:10:33,844
. . .fishing trip.

160
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:36,386
Jelly!
Let's go! Come on.

161
00:10:37,228 --> 00:10:38,391
I gotta go.

162
00:10:39,063 --> 00:10:40,558
I'll see you.

163
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:46,900
Pings and knocks.

164
00:10:47,155 --> 00:10:49,148
Cheap gas.
What are you gonna do?

165
00:10:49,449 --> 00:10:51,821
-Right.
-Take it easy, Doc!

166
00:11:06,591 --> 00:11:08,002
Neurotics only!

167
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:12,210
Oh, you must have been
a beautiful baby

168
00:11:12,431 --> 00:11:14,838
'Cause baby, look at you now

169
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,559
Thank God for Prozac

170
00:11:16,977 --> 00:11:20,512
Baby, look at you now

171
00:11:23,817 --> 00:11:26,522
You're not coming?
This is my wedding!

172
00:11:26,779 --> 00:11:29,732
We understand it's
a special day for you, Benny. . .

173
00:11:29,991 --> 00:11:32,398
. . .but we can't just
pick up and leave town. . .

174
00:11:32,659 --> 00:11:34,653
. . .every time you decide
to get married.

175
00:11:34,912 --> 00:11:36,988
Every time?
This is a once in a lifetime--

176
00:11:37,248 --> 00:11:39,454
Twice in a lifetime thing, Mom.

177
00:11:39,876 --> 00:11:42,545
Dad, you're not coming
to my wedding?

178
00:11:42,795 --> 00:11:45,832
We want to, but I have
three book signings next weekend.

179
00:11:46,089 --> 00:11:48,379
I can't piss off
these big bookstores.

180
00:11:48,718 --> 00:11:52,052
If I cancel, they stick me on the
bottom shelves. That's how they are.

181
00:11:52,305 --> 00:11:53,503
That's the word on the street.

182
00:11:53,765 --> 00:11:56,054
Barnes is okay, but Noble is
a vindictive prick.

183
00:11:56,309 --> 00:11:57,850
Ben.
The language.

184
00:11:58,103 --> 00:11:59,301
I'm sorry, but listen.

185
00:11:59,562 --> 00:12:01,639
I have been alone for eight years.

186
00:12:02,107 --> 00:12:05,310
I finally found somebody that
I want to spend my life with.

187
00:12:05,569 --> 00:12:07,856
At least meet her
before we get married.

188
00:12:08,112 --> 00:12:09,736
You are gonna be her family.

189
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:11,899
I think she should
know that up front.

190
00:12:12,158 --> 00:12:13,652
You're being very hostile.

191
00:12:14,411 --> 00:12:15,609
I was joking.

192
00:12:16,371 --> 00:12:17,747
I'm going to see the mayor.

193
00:12:17,998 --> 00:12:19,706
The mayor is here?

194
00:12:20,792 --> 00:12:22,037
What's wrong?

195
00:12:22,294 --> 00:12:23,836
Nothing.
Everything's fine.

196
00:12:24,129 --> 00:12:25,458
How's your practice?

197
00:12:25,756 --> 00:12:27,795
Excellent.
I have interesting patients.

198
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:30,921
Very interesting.
Fascinating, actually.

199
00:12:31,178 --> 00:12:33,669
Dad has a patient who
dreams he shits trout.

200
00:12:35,349 --> 00:12:36,594
Thanks, Mike.

201
00:12:38,144 --> 00:12:41,477
The Manetta family is bound
to ask questions.

202
00:12:42,606 --> 00:12:44,765
They think we put
the hit out on Dominic.

203
00:12:45,026 --> 00:12:47,102
Forget Dominic.
They were after Paul.

204
00:12:47,403 --> 00:12:49,775
It's a miracle you survived.
I just thank God.

205
00:12:50,114 --> 00:12:51,906
Yeah, thank God, all right.

206
00:12:52,158 --> 00:12:55,159
If it wasn't because I had to
go back for that toothpick. . .

207
00:12:55,411 --> 00:12:57,486
. . .I'd be lying dead with Dominic,
God forbid.

208
00:12:57,788 --> 00:12:59,034
May he rest in peace.

209
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:00,700
This is about the big meeting.

210
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:03,284
Primo Sindone wants to
run the whole show.

211
00:13:03,544 --> 00:13:05,003
Primo knows the rules.

212
00:13:05,255 --> 00:13:08,872
He couldn't come after them unless
he had permission from the families.

213
00:13:09,132 --> 00:13:12,384
If they did, we're headed for
one big war, I can tell you that.

214
00:13:12,636 --> 00:13:15,554
Find out what you can.
We got two weeks.

215
00:13:15,807 --> 00:13:18,559
God forbid the other
New York bosses are against us.

216
00:13:21,396 --> 00:13:24,147
I want to know that
before I go into that meeting.

217
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:25,265
Sure.

218
00:13:25,692 --> 00:13:27,600
You all right?
You don't look too good.

219
00:13:29,445 --> 00:13:30,773
What's the matter?

220
00:13:31,698 --> 00:13:34,320
I'm a little choked up.
I'm going to get some air.

221
00:13:34,576 --> 00:13:35,774
-Easy.
-Take some air.

222
00:13:47,548 --> 00:13:48,746
You all right?

223
00:13:49,884 --> 00:13:50,915
What?

224
00:13:53,721 --> 00:13:54,670
I feel like shit.

225
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:57,634
This whole thing is like
one big fucking headache.

226
00:13:57,892 --> 00:14:00,216
You having one of them "mindgraines"?

227
00:14:06,275 --> 00:14:08,101
-Let's go.
-What's the matter?

228
00:14:08,361 --> 00:14:09,736
-Just drive.
-What happened?

229
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:24,917
Good news, Mr. Evans.
Your heart is just fine.

230
00:14:25,377 --> 00:14:26,540
"Just fine"?

231
00:14:26,795 --> 00:14:29,881
But I had eight heart attacks
in the last three weeks.

232
00:14:30,133 --> 00:14:32,837
Based on everything,
I'd say you had an anxiety attack.

233
00:14:33,094 --> 00:14:34,174
A what?

234
00:14:34,429 --> 00:14:36,054
An anxiety attack.
A panic attack.

235
00:14:36,306 --> 00:14:37,337
I'll give you Xanax.

236
00:14:37,599 --> 00:14:39,307
Anxiety?
What are you saying?

237
00:14:39,559 --> 00:14:40,888
It's a common thing.

238
00:14:41,143 --> 00:14:42,722
Hey, look at me.

239
00:14:42,978 --> 00:14:45,304
Do I look like a guy who panics?

240
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:50,355
-Do I look like a guy who panics?
-It's nothing to be ashamed of.

241
00:14:50,571 --> 00:14:53,940
Where'd you go to medical school?
I got a fucking heart attack.

242
00:14:54,199 --> 00:14:55,824
Not according to your EKG.

243
00:15:08,379 --> 00:15:11,167
Jelly, I need you to do
something for me as a friend.

244
00:15:11,425 --> 00:15:12,254
Yeah, anything.

245
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:15,593
-Find me a doctor.
-We just come from the doctor.

246
00:15:15,846 --> 00:15:18,135
Not that kind of doctor.
Like a head doctor.

247
00:15:18,391 --> 00:15:20,631
You gonna change your face,
like Sonny Black?

248
00:15:20,892 --> 00:15:22,886
Don't get his nose.
He looks like a pig.

249
00:15:23,146 --> 00:15:26,479
Not a plastic surgeon.
I gotta spell everything out for you?

250
00:15:26,733 --> 00:15:28,191
It saves time.

251
00:15:30,236 --> 00:15:33,651
I mean, like a head doctor.
Like a psychiatrist.

252
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:38,699
This is like one of them psychic,
ESPN. . .

253
00:15:39,162 --> 00:15:41,320
. . .ESPN things, you know?

254
00:15:41,747 --> 00:15:45,080
I just ran into a psychiatrist.
Actually, he ran into me.

255
00:15:45,542 --> 00:15:46,658
Was he any good?

256
00:15:48,213 --> 00:15:50,881
He seemed like a smart guy.
He had a business card.

257
00:15:51,131 --> 00:15:54,252
A business card?
That's a real fucking achievement.

258
00:15:59,598 --> 00:16:01,010
What do you need a shrink for?

259
00:16:01,268 --> 00:16:03,142
It's not for me.
It's for my friend.

260
00:16:03,353 --> 00:16:05,809
I'm gonna ask the shrink
some questions. . .

261
00:16:06,064 --> 00:16:07,856
. . .and get some answers
for my friend.

262
00:16:08,108 --> 00:16:12,058
Nobody can know. God forbid somebody
hears I been talking to a shrink.

263
00:16:12,321 --> 00:16:13,780
It could be interpreted wrong.

264
00:16:14,072 --> 00:16:15,068
Know what I mean?

265
00:16:15,449 --> 00:16:17,275
No one will ever know.

266
00:16:17,534 --> 00:16:20,072
-Could I just ask one question?
-Go ahead.

267
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:21,777
This friend. . .

268
00:16:22,665 --> 00:16:23,578
. . .is it me?

269
00:16:26,293 --> 00:16:27,289
Yeah, it's you.

270
00:16:30,339 --> 00:16:33,755
Carl, I'm detecting a pattern.
You settle too easily for things.

271
00:16:34,176 --> 00:16:36,169
You're right.
I do.

272
00:16:37,722 --> 00:16:39,382
See, you just did it again.

273
00:16:39,764 --> 00:16:42,470
I suggested something,
and you immediately agreed.

274
00:16:43,478 --> 00:16:44,887
You're right.
I did.

275
00:16:45,146 --> 00:16:46,426
Why do you do this?

276
00:16:46,689 --> 00:16:48,148
I don't know.

277
00:16:48,816 --> 00:16:51,604
I think it's your fear
of rejection or disapproval.

278
00:16:51,861 --> 00:16:54,102
You don't have to
worry about that.

279
00:16:54,363 --> 00:16:56,191
Be your own man.
Stand your ground.

280
00:16:56,448 --> 00:16:59,023
You don't have to
let people roll over you.

281
00:16:59,285 --> 00:17:00,115
Dr. Sobel?

282
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:01,449
We're in session.

283
00:17:01,705 --> 00:17:03,696
Yeah, I know.
I'm sorry.

284
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:07,290
You're the guy I hit last night.

285
00:17:07,544 --> 00:17:09,452
Bingo.
Get out of here.

286
00:17:10,004 --> 00:17:12,294
Upsy-daisy.
Got a coat, nutbar?

287
00:17:12,549 --> 00:17:13,580
-What--?
-He's leaving.

288
00:17:13,842 --> 00:17:16,629
He's not going till
he's done with his session.

289
00:17:16,887 --> 00:17:19,045
-I'll give you $1 00 to leave.
-Don't take it.

290
00:17:19,306 --> 00:17:20,551
-Make it 1 50.
-Listen.

291
00:17:20,806 --> 00:17:21,803
300.

292
00:17:22,434 --> 00:17:24,142
He ain't that fucking crazy.

293
00:17:24,977 --> 00:17:26,556
You were right.
I stood my ground.

294
00:17:26,813 --> 00:17:28,972
-This was the wrong time.
-I got him up from 1 50.

295
00:17:29,233 --> 00:17:30,976
-I'm proud.
-I feel like a new man.

296
00:17:31,234 --> 00:17:32,397
I'm so happy.

297
00:17:32,653 --> 00:17:35,773
I know you're upset about the car,
but you can't come in here.

298
00:17:36,031 --> 00:17:38,024
This is a patient's private session.

299
00:17:41,579 --> 00:17:42,408
You know me?

300
00:17:42,663 --> 00:17:44,122
-Yes.
-No, you don't.

301
00:17:48,336 --> 00:17:50,127
You seen my picture
in the paper?

302
00:17:50,379 --> 00:17:51,577
-Yes.
-No, you didn't.

303
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:53,583
I don't even get the paper.

304
00:17:59,347 --> 00:18:00,841
Jelly, wait outside.

305
00:18:02,392 --> 00:18:03,222
Sit down.

306
00:18:09,357 --> 00:18:10,935
You ain't got no bugs in here?

307
00:18:11,192 --> 00:18:11,974
Bugs?

308
00:18:12,235 --> 00:18:14,144
Bugs.
Recording equipment.

309
00:18:14,821 --> 00:18:17,573
No, I don't record.
I take notes.

310
00:18:19,659 --> 00:18:22,696
I tried to give him the insurance
information several times.

311
00:18:22,954 --> 00:18:24,069
Several times.

312
00:18:24,331 --> 00:18:25,493
He wouldn't take it.

313
00:18:25,749 --> 00:18:26,994
Please don't kill me.

314
00:18:27,709 --> 00:18:30,331
I was just gonna ask
if you like Tony Bennett.

315
00:18:31,505 --> 00:18:33,497
I'm a big Tony Bennett fan.

316
00:18:34,424 --> 00:18:35,338
Me too.

317
00:18:35,592 --> 00:18:37,501
I like all ltalian singers.

318
00:18:38,595 --> 00:18:40,967
Mr. Vitti,
I know it's not your fault. . .

319
00:18:41,223 --> 00:18:43,975
. . .but shouldn't we take this up
with our insurance companies?

320
00:18:44,226 --> 00:18:46,468
That ain't it.
I don't care about the car.

321
00:18:46,729 --> 00:18:48,721
I got a friend of mine. . . .

322
00:18:48,981 --> 00:18:52,931
He's got problems, and he'll
have to probably see a shrink.

323
00:18:53,194 --> 00:18:54,902
So I'll ask you
a couple of questions.

324
00:18:55,738 --> 00:18:57,066
Go ahead, then.

325
00:18:59,116 --> 00:19:01,025
What do we do?
What, we sit?

326
00:19:01,285 --> 00:19:02,993
Whatever makes you comfortable.

327
00:19:03,245 --> 00:19:04,325
I'll sit over here.

328
00:19:06,499 --> 00:19:07,958
-I'll sit here.
-That's your--

329
00:19:08,251 --> 00:19:10,409
If you're comfortable,
it's fine.

330
00:19:17,135 --> 00:19:18,380
So who starts?

331
00:19:20,013 --> 00:19:22,052
Tell me why you think
you need therapy.

332
00:19:22,765 --> 00:19:26,051
I don't need therapy.
I told you that. It's for my friend.

333
00:19:26,311 --> 00:19:28,054
-I'm sorry.
-You didn't hear me?

334
00:19:28,313 --> 00:19:29,143
I'm sorry.

335
00:19:29,397 --> 00:19:33,347
You're supposed to be good at listening.
You can't remember what I said?

336
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:34,725
So sorry.

337
00:19:34,986 --> 00:19:38,438
I ain't thrilled with the
level of service up to this point.

338
00:19:38,698 --> 00:19:40,572
That was my fault.
I apologize.

339
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,200
Why don't we start over?

340
00:19:44,955 --> 00:19:47,327
Why don't you just tell me
about your friend?

341
00:19:49,459 --> 00:19:52,959
This friend, you know,
he's a very powerful guy.

342
00:19:53,463 --> 00:19:55,006
Never had trouble
with nothing.

343
00:19:55,257 --> 00:19:57,546
All of a sudden,
he's falling apart. . .

344
00:19:57,801 --> 00:20:00,672
. . .he cries for no reason,
he can't sleep. . .

345
00:20:00,929 --> 00:20:02,637
. . .he can't be with his friends.

346
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:05,262
All of a sudden,
he gets nervous around them.

347
00:20:05,517 --> 00:20:07,012
He wants to get away from them.

348
00:20:07,269 --> 00:20:10,270
And these are guys he knows
his whole life, you know?

349
00:20:10,523 --> 00:20:12,432
And then he has these attacks.

350
00:20:13,692 --> 00:20:16,777
He can't breathe,
he gets dizzy. . .

351
00:20:17,488 --> 00:20:19,279
. . .chest pains, you know. . . .

352
00:20:19,657 --> 00:20:22,195
He thinks he's going to
die or something.

353
00:20:22,451 --> 00:20:23,566
Panic attacks.

354
00:20:23,828 --> 00:20:25,619
What's with you guys
and panic attacks?

355
00:20:25,872 --> 00:20:27,330
Who said "panic"?

356
00:20:27,582 --> 00:20:28,696
Who said "panic"?

357
00:20:28,958 --> 00:20:29,954
Not panic.

358
00:20:30,209 --> 00:20:32,747
Dizzy, chest-breathing,
constricting. . .

359
00:20:33,379 --> 00:20:34,755
. . .attacks.

360
00:20:35,006 --> 00:20:38,624
This guy, he just wants to know
what he can do to make it stop.

361
00:20:42,972 --> 00:20:45,214
I'm gonna go out on a limb here.

362
00:20:46,309 --> 00:20:48,432
I think your friend. . .

363
00:20:49,312 --> 00:20:50,510
. . .is you.

364
00:21:00,282 --> 00:21:02,156
You got a gift, my friend.

365
00:21:02,409 --> 00:21:04,117
You got a gift.

366
00:21:06,246 --> 00:21:09,033
You saw that there was something
I was trying to do. . .

367
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:11,829
. . .and figured it out.
That's why you are who you are.

368
00:21:12,503 --> 00:21:14,211
God bless you.
You got a fucking gift.

369
00:21:14,463 --> 00:21:15,578
-No, I don't.
-Yes, you do.

370
00:21:15,839 --> 00:21:18,165
-No, I don't.
-Yes, you do.

371
00:21:19,802 --> 00:21:20,916
Go on.

372
00:21:21,428 --> 00:21:22,839
-What?
-Go on.

373
00:21:23,722 --> 00:21:24,920
I think. . .

374
00:21:26,183 --> 00:21:27,381
. . .medication could help.

375
00:21:27,643 --> 00:21:28,888
Drugs?

376
00:21:29,228 --> 00:21:30,853
Can't do drugs.
I don't do drugs.

377
00:21:32,189 --> 00:21:34,562
If you want to get to
the root of the problem. . .

378
00:21:34,817 --> 00:21:36,608
. . .you'll want to get
some form of therapy.

379
00:21:36,861 --> 00:21:38,770
Like what?
With you or something?

380
00:21:39,363 --> 00:21:42,115
Me?
No, I don't think you want--

381
00:21:43,159 --> 00:21:45,033
My roster of patients is full.

382
00:21:45,286 --> 00:21:48,869
I'm full right now.
Plus, I'm leaving on a short vacation.

383
00:21:49,123 --> 00:21:50,037
Where you going?

384
00:21:50,541 --> 00:21:52,700
-I don't share that with patients.
-Where?

385
00:21:52,961 --> 00:21:55,534
Sheraton Bal Harbour Hotel
in Miami Beach.

386
00:21:55,797 --> 00:21:57,256
That wasn't so hard, was it?

387
00:21:57,507 --> 00:21:58,966
No, it wasn't.

388
00:22:02,262 --> 00:22:04,669
You know, it's a funny
kind of a thing. . .

389
00:22:04,931 --> 00:22:08,098
. . .but I feel better after
I got all that off my chest.

390
00:22:08,351 --> 00:22:09,894
I feel like a load. . . .

391
00:22:10,145 --> 00:22:12,054
A load is off my shoulders.

392
00:22:13,106 --> 00:22:14,221
You're good.

393
00:22:15,108 --> 00:22:16,271
Doc, thank you.

394
00:22:17,486 --> 00:22:19,063
-I didn't do anything.
-You did.

395
00:22:19,321 --> 00:22:20,519
-I did nothing.
-You did too.

396
00:22:20,781 --> 00:22:23,069
The load, gone.
Where is it?

397
00:22:23,325 --> 00:22:24,605
Don't know.

398
00:22:25,577 --> 00:22:27,036
You're good.

399
00:22:27,538 --> 00:22:29,329
You're good, Doc.

400
00:22:29,665 --> 00:22:31,622
I'll be getting in touch with you.

401
00:22:31,875 --> 00:22:34,164
-Don't, please.
-One more thing.

402
00:22:34,545 --> 00:22:39,041
If I talk to you, and you turn me
into a fag, I'll kill you. Understand?

403
00:22:40,467 --> 00:22:42,923
Could we define "fag"?
Because some feelings--

404
00:22:43,179 --> 00:22:45,385
-I go fag, you die. Got it?
-Got it.

405
00:22:45,639 --> 00:22:46,588
Simple.

406
00:22:47,767 --> 00:22:48,929
You're good, Doc.

407
00:22:49,435 --> 00:22:50,680
You're good.

408
00:22:53,022 --> 00:22:54,267
See you, Doc.

409
00:23:07,495 --> 00:23:10,698
We take on Manetta,
what does Vitti do? Nothing.

410
00:23:10,957 --> 00:23:13,413
-Why doesn't he move?
-Fuck him.

411
00:23:13,668 --> 00:23:16,503
You say "fuck him,"
but he's planning something big.

412
00:23:16,755 --> 00:23:17,786
The shit's coming down.

413
00:23:18,048 --> 00:23:19,672
Then let it come down.

414
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:21,758
Let me tell you,
Vitti's a tough guy. . .

415
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:25,675
. . .but a lot of tough guys get fed to
the crabs off Red Hook.

416
00:23:26,389 --> 00:23:29,426
Vitti. That name has been
haunting me since I was a kid.

417
00:23:29,684 --> 00:23:32,520
Growing up, he was the smart guy.
I was the dope.

418
00:23:32,771 --> 00:23:35,807
My father was a nickel-and-dime
shitheel. His had it all.

419
00:23:36,066 --> 00:23:38,224
Vito Genovese blew it at Apalachin. . .

420
00:23:38,485 --> 00:23:41,439
. . .because he forgot to kill
Gambino before the meeting.

421
00:23:41,697 --> 00:23:44,614
I won't make that same mistake.
I want Paul Vitti dead!

422
00:23:44,867 --> 00:23:48,485
You hear me? I want him dead.
Not breathing now. Dead!

423
00:23:50,914 --> 00:23:51,863
Like the pants?

424
00:23:52,666 --> 00:23:54,326
They look great.
He's some tailor.

425
00:23:54,585 --> 00:23:56,127
I'll tell you. Look good.

426
00:23:56,378 --> 00:23:57,208
I like them.

427
00:24:01,634 --> 00:24:05,501
Don't leave any food in your room.
I won't come home to a science fair.

428
00:24:05,763 --> 00:24:07,174
I didn't.

429
00:24:07,682 --> 00:24:09,591
Dad, one thing, though.

430
00:24:10,643 --> 00:24:12,018
-"I go fag, you die. "
-That's it!

431
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:13,847
I'm sealing the vent
in your room.

432
00:24:14,105 --> 00:24:15,765
You cannot listen to my sessions!

433
00:24:16,023 --> 00:24:18,561
It's so cool.
Was that really Paul Vitti?

434
00:24:18,818 --> 00:24:22,021
I didn't ask to see his
Mafia decoder ring, but yes.

435
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:25,696
-Are you going to treat him?
-Of course not. Are you crazy?

436
00:24:26,784 --> 00:24:29,785
You cannot tell anybody
that he was here. Understand?

437
00:24:30,038 --> 00:24:31,746
Should I take it off the lnternet?

438
00:24:31,998 --> 00:24:33,029
I'm kidding.

439
00:24:41,174 --> 00:24:45,338
Despite the heat and the popularity of
more exotic Caribbean destinations...

440
00:24:45,595 --> 00:24:48,680
...Florida 's hospitality industry
reports booming business...

441
00:24:48,932 --> 00:24:50,676
...from Orlando to the Keys.

442
00:24:50,934 --> 00:24:52,263
Judging from the mob...

443
00:24:52,519 --> 00:24:53,717
...around the pool here...

444
00:24:53,979 --> 00:24:58,024
... there's nothing "off" about the
off-season in Miami Beach this summer.

445
00:24:58,275 --> 00:25:02,569
On a personal note,
this is my last report for WVBF.

446
00:25:02,821 --> 00:25:05,573
I'm marrying a wonderful man
and moving to New York.

447
00:25:05,866 --> 00:25:07,491
Thanks for everything, Miami.

448
00:25:07,743 --> 00:25:11,575
For the last time, this is
Laura MacNamara for WVBF.

449
00:25:13,415 --> 00:25:14,329
Catch!

450
00:25:16,752 --> 00:25:18,294
We're clear!
Nice, Laura.

451
00:25:26,804 --> 00:25:29,722
Everybody! This is him!
This is the guy!

452
00:25:30,641 --> 00:25:33,049
-I missed you so much.
-I missed you too.

453
00:25:33,311 --> 00:25:35,434
-Michael, say hi.
-Hi, Laura.

454
00:25:35,688 --> 00:25:37,895
Hi, Michael.
How are you?

455
00:25:38,858 --> 00:25:40,602
You want to go
look at the camera?

456
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:43,019
Why would I want to go
look at the camera?

457
00:25:45,573 --> 00:25:47,447
-Is it okay?
-Yeah, go ahead.

458
00:25:47,701 --> 00:25:50,867
Don't worry if you break anything.
I'm out of here.

459
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:55,580
-You think he likes me?
-He's crazy about you. No, he is.

460
00:25:55,834 --> 00:25:57,873
I love you.
I'm so glad to be with you.

461
00:25:58,253 --> 00:26:00,495
Do you really?
And do you really love me?

462
00:26:00,756 --> 00:26:02,713
Of course.
What's the matter?

463
00:26:03,508 --> 00:26:05,335
-I'm nervous.
-Why?

464
00:26:05,677 --> 00:26:08,429
Because I'm going to be
a stepmom to a grown kid. . .

465
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:09,961
. . .and we're getting married.

466
00:26:10,224 --> 00:26:12,015
So what are you worried about?

467
00:26:12,267 --> 00:26:13,892
What if you get tired of me?

468
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:16,979
A lot of couples are very happy,
and then they marry. . .

469
00:26:17,231 --> 00:26:19,473
. . .and completely lose interest
in each other.

470
00:26:19,775 --> 00:26:21,483
That won't happen to us.

471
00:26:36,917 --> 00:26:38,542
Is everything okay, Paul?

472
00:26:38,794 --> 00:26:41,332
Will you stop talking?
I'm trying to do this here.

473
00:26:42,798 --> 00:26:45,883
-You seem distracted.
-I am. I got things on my mind.

474
00:26:46,135 --> 00:26:48,258
-Would you stop talking?
-I'm sorry.

475
00:26:48,513 --> 00:26:49,544
Lie down.

476
00:26:53,017 --> 00:26:54,262
Thinking about your wife?

477
00:26:54,519 --> 00:26:58,018
I wasn't thinking about my wife.
What are you talking about?

478
00:27:08,533 --> 00:27:10,111
Now I am thinking about my wife.

479
00:27:10,368 --> 00:27:12,990
Sheila, why can't you
keep your mouth shut?

480
00:27:13,246 --> 00:27:14,160
Sorry.

481
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:22,910
Dr. Sobel.

482
00:27:27,636 --> 00:27:28,916
Mom?

483
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:34,048
It's me.

484
00:27:34,309 --> 00:27:36,979
Mr. Vitti wants to see you.
I got your robe.

485
00:27:39,023 --> 00:27:43,435
I got news for you, you two-bit prick,
son-of-a-bitch rat bastard. . .

486
00:27:43,694 --> 00:27:46,695
. . .you did nothing for me!
Whatever you did, it didn't take.

487
00:27:46,947 --> 00:27:49,189
I'm still fucked up.
You did nothing for me!

488
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:52,736
I did nothing for you?
I saw you for five minutes.

489
00:27:52,995 --> 00:27:54,240
What do you expect?

490
00:27:54,497 --> 00:27:57,782
I can't work miracles.
Let me tell you something else.

491
00:27:58,125 --> 00:28:00,367
I don't like it when someone
breaks in. . .

492
00:28:00,628 --> 00:28:02,621
. . .and kidnaps me
in the middle of the night!

493
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,423
I have a family.
I have a life.

494
00:28:04,674 --> 00:28:06,298
And I have a serious practice.

495
00:28:06,551 --> 00:28:09,089
And I don't have time
for your bullshit!

496
00:28:09,971 --> 00:28:12,047
That got away from me
at the end there.

497
00:28:15,143 --> 00:28:16,803
I couldn't get it up last night.

498
00:28:18,021 --> 00:28:19,183
Do you mean sexually?

499
00:28:19,397 --> 00:28:21,224
No, for the big
Michigan State game.

500
00:28:21,483 --> 00:28:23,771
Of course, sexually!
What's the matter with you?

501
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:25,355
Can I get this straight?

502
00:28:25,612 --> 00:28:28,946
You flew 1 ,500 miles,
you dragged me out of bed. . .

503
00:28:29,241 --> 00:28:31,280
. . .because you couldn't get
an erection?

504
00:28:31,535 --> 00:28:33,611
Don't that prove I'm motivated?

505
00:28:33,995 --> 00:28:35,656
You can take a pill for that.

506
00:28:35,914 --> 00:28:36,780
That's a cheat.

507
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:39,496
You start with the pills,
next it's hydraulics.

508
00:28:39,751 --> 00:28:42,669
A hard-on should be gotten
legitimately or not at all.

509
00:28:42,921 --> 00:28:44,629
I think Mark Twain said that.

510
00:28:44,923 --> 00:28:47,046
Are you gonna help me or not?

511
00:28:48,177 --> 00:28:50,383
I don't believe this.
All right.

512
00:28:52,181 --> 00:28:53,426
Has this happened before?

513
00:28:53,682 --> 00:28:55,224
The dead-dick thing?

514
00:28:56,352 --> 00:28:58,890
Never.
Well, one time. Last night.

515
00:28:59,855 --> 00:29:00,851
One more time.

516
00:29:01,107 --> 00:29:01,937
So twice.

517
00:29:02,191 --> 00:29:03,982
Do the math.
Two times.

518
00:29:04,944 --> 00:29:07,980
Then another time, but after
a big meal, so that don't count.

519
00:29:08,239 --> 00:29:11,156
Being unable to perform
three or four times is not--

520
00:29:11,409 --> 00:29:12,571
Eight times.

521
00:29:13,161 --> 00:29:14,821
Eight times is not catastrophic.

522
00:29:15,079 --> 00:29:16,739
Maybe not to you.
Look at you.

523
00:29:17,623 --> 00:29:20,660
But if I can't get it up,
that makes me less of a man.

524
00:29:20,918 --> 00:29:22,792
In my world,
I deal with animals.

525
00:29:23,046 --> 00:29:25,797
They may seem dumb to
an educated guy like you. . .

526
00:29:26,049 --> 00:29:29,085
. . .but animals are very cunning,
and they sense weakness.

527
00:29:29,844 --> 00:29:31,125
I got less than two weeks. . .

528
00:29:31,387 --> 00:29:33,925
. . .to get strong, or they'll kill me.

529
00:29:34,182 --> 00:29:35,178
What happens then?

530
00:29:35,433 --> 00:29:37,390
I can't tell you.
You don't want to know.

531
00:29:37,644 --> 00:29:40,764
You can't tell me and I don't
want to know. That's a big help.

532
00:29:41,022 --> 00:29:42,932
You're supposed to tell me.
I want to know.

533
00:29:43,191 --> 00:29:45,516
That's how this works.
This is impossible.

534
00:29:45,777 --> 00:29:48,862
I can't do anything in two weeks,
and even if I could. . .

535
00:29:49,114 --> 00:29:52,364
. . .what is my goal? To make you
a happy, well-adjusted gangster?

536
00:29:52,909 --> 00:29:55,365
The other day I was watching
a TV commercial. . .

537
00:29:55,662 --> 00:29:57,322
. . .some kid playing with puppies.

538
00:29:57,581 --> 00:29:59,372
I cried for 45 minutes.

539
00:29:59,708 --> 00:30:01,535
Slap a pair of tits on me, I'm a woman.

540
00:30:01,794 --> 00:30:02,825
I can't help you.

541
00:30:03,087 --> 00:30:04,201
You're turning me down?

542
00:30:04,463 --> 00:30:08,591
When I got into family therapy,
this wasn't the family I had in mind.

543
00:30:08,842 --> 00:30:13,255
You with your schmucky little office
and house, you're turning me down?

544
00:30:13,514 --> 00:30:15,839
So you can listen to
housewives piss and moan. . .

545
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:18,176
. . .about nobody fucks them
right anymore?

546
00:30:18,436 --> 00:30:19,681
I'm leaving now.

547
00:30:19,937 --> 00:30:20,933
You see this?

548
00:30:21,188 --> 00:30:22,848
This is what I'm talking about.

549
00:30:23,107 --> 00:30:24,649
I'm a dead man.

550
00:30:27,111 --> 00:30:30,361
You call yourself a doctor.
You should be ashamed of yourself.

551
00:30:31,866 --> 00:30:36,160
A real doctor could never turn his back
on a person who's suffering!

552
00:30:36,996 --> 00:30:41,623
You couldn't treat a fucking
two-celled amoeba, you fucking phony.

553
00:30:45,255 --> 00:30:48,421
Mother of God, give me
the strength to get through this.

554
00:30:49,175 --> 00:30:50,420
This fucking rat bastard. . .

555
00:30:50,677 --> 00:30:52,052
. . .won't help me.

556
00:30:53,847 --> 00:30:57,595
I cry all the time. . . .
Don't know what it is.

557
00:30:58,268 --> 00:30:59,466
All right, here.

558
00:31:02,063 --> 00:31:03,178
Sit down.

559
00:31:06,943 --> 00:31:08,106
Sit down.

560
00:31:12,533 --> 00:31:14,691
What happened with
your wife last night?

561
00:31:14,952 --> 00:31:17,407
I wasn't with my wife.
I was with my girlfriend.

562
00:31:17,663 --> 00:31:19,287
Are you having marriage problems?

563
00:31:19,998 --> 00:31:21,409
Why do you have a girlfriend?

564
00:31:21,667 --> 00:31:23,161
You're moralizing with me now?

565
00:31:23,419 --> 00:31:25,826
No, I'm curious.
Why do you have a girlfriend?

566
00:31:26,088 --> 00:31:28,294
I do things with her
I can't do with my wife.

567
00:31:28,549 --> 00:31:29,877
Why can't you?

568
00:31:30,134 --> 00:31:33,467
That's the mouth she kisses
my kids with. Are you crazy?

569
00:31:35,848 --> 00:31:37,591
Have you been under stress lately?

570
00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:40,851
-Like seeing your best friend murdered?
-That would qualify.

571
00:31:41,103 --> 00:31:42,895
I got a lot of stress.

572
00:31:47,193 --> 00:31:49,945
Based upon what you told me before
about the attacks. . .

573
00:31:50,196 --> 00:31:51,904
. . .I'd say that was probably it.

574
00:31:52,991 --> 00:31:54,615
-Just stress?
-"Just stress"?

575
00:31:54,867 --> 00:31:56,611
Stress is a very powerful force.

576
00:31:56,869 --> 00:31:59,740
I doubt there's anything
physically wrong with you.

577
00:31:59,998 --> 00:32:01,871
-That's it?
-That's it.

578
00:32:02,917 --> 00:32:03,949
That's it?

579
00:32:04,210 --> 00:32:05,124
I think so.

580
00:32:07,839 --> 00:32:09,167
You're very good, you.

581
00:32:09,424 --> 00:32:10,669
You are very good.

582
00:32:10,926 --> 00:32:13,002
-There's more to it--
-You're very good.

583
00:32:13,261 --> 00:32:15,218
-There are underlying--
-Understand me?

584
00:32:15,472 --> 00:32:16,847
You're right on the money.

585
00:32:17,099 --> 00:32:19,637
I feel the juices rush back
to my balls as we speak.

586
00:32:19,893 --> 00:32:22,301
I never thought I'd hear
a man say that to me.

587
00:32:22,562 --> 00:32:24,721
That settles it.
You are my shrink.

588
00:32:24,982 --> 00:32:26,392
No, I couldn't.

589
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:28,109
You're not ready to open up.

590
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:30,103
You're not a good candidate--

591
00:32:30,362 --> 00:32:33,363
Listen to you.
The fucking honesty.

592
00:32:33,615 --> 00:32:34,813
That's it.
You don't understand.

593
00:32:35,075 --> 00:32:37,401
Nobody, nobody talks
to me like that.

594
00:32:37,661 --> 00:32:39,072
You understand?

595
00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:40,740
-Yes, I do.
-That's it.

596
00:32:40,998 --> 00:32:42,029
Let's do it.
I'm ready.

597
00:32:42,291 --> 00:32:44,165
You don't hear the word "no"
very often.

598
00:32:44,418 --> 00:32:47,668
I hear it all the time,
only it's more, "No, please, no, no. "

599
00:32:48,339 --> 00:32:49,916
I'm here for two more days.

600
00:32:50,174 --> 00:32:53,377
When I get back to New York,
I'll treat you exclusively.

601
00:32:53,636 --> 00:32:54,881
For two weeks.

602
00:32:55,721 --> 00:32:57,679
I just don't know what
to tell my patients.

603
00:32:57,932 --> 00:32:59,556
You want me to clear
your schedule?

604
00:32:59,809 --> 00:33:02,644
It would be my honor to do that.
My pleasure.

605
00:33:03,312 --> 00:33:05,270
Not Jimmy.
I will do this myself.

606
00:33:05,523 --> 00:33:06,602
-You sure?
-Positive.

607
00:33:06,858 --> 00:33:08,482
I will see you in New York.

608
00:33:08,735 --> 00:33:11,689
Okay.
Want one of them?

609
00:33:11,946 --> 00:33:12,942
-No, thanks.
-Sure?

610
00:33:13,198 --> 00:33:15,155
That's very kind of you, but l. . . .

611
00:33:15,408 --> 00:33:17,484
Want to give a little sta minch ?

612
00:33:18,161 --> 00:33:19,406
You sure?

613
00:33:20,413 --> 00:33:21,694
The pause that refreshes.

614
00:33:21,956 --> 00:33:23,581
I don't--
No, I really. . . .

615
00:33:23,959 --> 00:33:24,872
You're on vacation.

616
00:33:25,126 --> 00:33:26,953
I'm also about to get married. . .

617
00:33:27,212 --> 00:33:29,619
. . .so I'd like to go back
to my hotel and. . . .

618
00:33:29,881 --> 00:33:30,711
Good night.

619
00:33:30,966 --> 00:33:32,164
I'll see you in New York.

620
00:33:32,509 --> 00:33:34,965
You.
Hey, Doc. You.

621
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:37,090
I'm gonna see a lot of you.

622
00:33:39,808 --> 00:33:41,053
Where were you?

623
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:43,219
My God, I woke up
and you were gone!

624
00:33:43,478 --> 00:33:46,100
There was no note or anything!
I was out of my mind!

625
00:33:46,356 --> 00:33:48,563
I walked all over the hotel
looking for you.

626
00:33:48,817 --> 00:33:51,771
I even ate a Rice Krispy Treat.
I almost called the police.

627
00:33:52,029 --> 00:33:54,900
No, don't call the police.
I'll tell you the truth.

628
00:33:55,157 --> 00:33:57,031
I had a patient emergency.

629
00:33:57,284 --> 00:33:59,277
You have patients in Florida?

630
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:03,237
One. He followed me from New York.
I had to go, trust me.

631
00:34:03,499 --> 00:34:05,408
My God.
Who is this patient?

632
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:08,873
Paul Vitti.

633
00:34:13,175 --> 00:34:14,670
Mafia Paul Vitti?

634
00:34:17,054 --> 00:34:18,964
Oh, my God.

635
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:24,223
It's not like
he's a regular patient.

636
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:25,759
He's got problems.

637
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:29,351
He thinks that I'm treating him.
It's crazy.

638
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:31,020
So you're not treating him?

639
00:34:31,277 --> 00:34:32,440
Tell me you're not.

640
00:34:32,695 --> 00:34:33,858
I'm not treating him.

641
00:34:34,114 --> 00:34:37,150
It's scary. You don't want
someone like that in your life.

642
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:40,196
I've covered the mob down here.
I've seen what they do.

643
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:43,490
He and I spoke about it.
He understood. It's over.

644
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:45,907
-You're sure?
-Absolutely.

645
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:49,794
I was so worried.

646
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:52,039
I thought maybe you
got scared or. . .

647
00:34:52,299 --> 00:34:54,256
. . .saw an ex-girlfriend
or something.

648
00:34:54,593 --> 00:34:56,253
Well, I don't know.

649
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:58,631
-I love you.
-I love you.

650
00:34:58,889 --> 00:35:02,092
I'm sorry, but everything's
going to be okay.

651
00:35:05,396 --> 00:35:07,388
Give her a big hand!
Let's hear it!

652
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:09,023
How about that?

653
00:35:13,737 --> 00:35:16,359
That was great!
Come on, get into it.

654
00:35:17,032 --> 00:35:19,072
I don't understand.
They splash in the water.

655
00:35:19,326 --> 00:35:20,358
They eat fish.

656
00:35:20,619 --> 00:35:22,244
This is not a big stretch
for a whale.

657
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:23,445
Stop it.

658
00:35:23,706 --> 00:35:25,449
We're having fun, right?

659
00:35:25,958 --> 00:35:28,876
I'm not having as much fun
as it looks like I am.

660
00:35:29,128 --> 00:35:31,880
I'm pretending, because we
have to bond and all.

661
00:35:36,676 --> 00:35:40,889
A little snack for her
might be 50 pounds of mackerel.

662
00:35:43,475 --> 00:35:44,805
There she goes!

663
00:35:48,564 --> 00:35:51,316
I'm going to get a hot dog.
Anybody want anything?

664
00:35:51,568 --> 00:35:53,025
-I'll go with you.
-It's fine.

665
00:35:53,277 --> 00:35:56,065
You're pretending to have a good time.
I don't want to spoil that.

666
00:35:56,323 --> 00:35:57,520
I'll be right back.

667
00:35:57,782 --> 00:35:59,858
You think those whales
piss in that water?

668
00:36:00,117 --> 00:36:04,116
I think they use the men's room
next door to the Burger King.

669
00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:05,195
Dummy.

670
00:36:05,456 --> 00:36:07,614
-What's going on?
-Mr. Vitti wants to see you.

671
00:36:07,875 --> 00:36:08,906
Is this a joke?

672
00:36:09,169 --> 00:36:10,414
You're employed
by Mr Vitti. . .

673
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:13,077
. . .which means you're on call
24 hours a day. . .

674
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:14,750
. . .just like the rest of us.

675
00:36:15,008 --> 00:36:16,336
I'm sorry.
He and I discussed--

676
00:36:16,593 --> 00:36:19,712
We discussed this, and I agreed
to see him in New York.

677
00:36:19,971 --> 00:36:20,802
That's it.

678
00:36:21,055 --> 00:36:23,926
Doctor, listen to me.
It is what it is.

679
00:36:24,183 --> 00:36:28,133
If he wants you sooner, you go sooner.
That's it.

680
00:36:28,396 --> 00:36:29,595
No.
I am not going.

681
00:36:29,856 --> 00:36:32,348
And if either one of you
bother me again. . .

682
00:36:32,610 --> 00:36:34,019
. . .I won't treat him at all.

683
00:36:34,278 --> 00:36:36,152
Do you understand that?
Capisci?

684
00:36:36,405 --> 00:36:38,730
It's over!
End of story.

685
00:36:40,117 --> 00:36:42,324
Look at the size of this one.

686
00:36:42,745 --> 00:36:44,738
Jesus Christ!

687
00:36:46,581 --> 00:36:47,957
It's feeding time.

688
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:52,334
They threw me in
the shark tank, Paul.

689
00:36:52,588 --> 00:36:53,833
They wanted to make a point.

690
00:36:54,090 --> 00:36:56,166
That you're scary?
Believe me, I get it.

691
00:36:56,425 --> 00:36:57,256
You're in a mood.

692
00:36:57,509 --> 00:37:00,084
I get that way when
a shark tries to chew on my ass.

693
00:37:00,346 --> 00:37:02,967
-We had an agreement.
-We did, but I had an episode.

694
00:37:03,223 --> 00:37:06,178
I didn't have a panic attack,
but I started panicking. . .

695
00:37:06,435 --> 00:37:08,428
. . .thinking I might get one.
Is that weird?

696
00:37:08,688 --> 00:37:11,309
I am redefining "weird"
on an hourly basis.

697
00:37:11,565 --> 00:37:13,310
-What's he doing?
-I don't know.

698
00:37:13,568 --> 00:37:15,976
-He's talking with some guy.
-Can you hit him?

699
00:37:16,237 --> 00:37:19,274
He's got fat Jelly and his
partner Jimmy Boots with him.

700
00:37:19,533 --> 00:37:22,486
I could do it with a rifle,
but I don't have that with me.

701
00:37:22,744 --> 00:37:23,775
Just get him.

702
00:37:24,037 --> 00:37:26,077
You told me to take care of him,
I will.

703
00:37:26,331 --> 00:37:28,370
What were you thinking
when you got anxious?

704
00:37:28,625 --> 00:37:30,914
Let's get out of here.
We're being watched.

705
00:37:31,170 --> 00:37:33,874
Don't look.
There's feds up there watching us.

706
00:37:34,131 --> 00:37:35,790
How do you know that?

707
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:37,715
I'm a criminal.
It's my job.

708
00:37:38,927 --> 00:37:40,042
Who's the new face?

709
00:37:41,764 --> 00:37:44,219
Maybe he's Vitti's new consigliere.

710
00:37:44,474 --> 00:37:47,476
Whoever this guy is,
he must be important to the family.

711
00:37:47,728 --> 00:37:50,433
Put his picture on the wire.
See what you come up with.

712
00:37:54,901 --> 00:37:58,947
Normally, a patient wouldn't have
a vat of scotch during a session.

713
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:04,614
That's interesting. I'll have to
remember it if I'm ever on Jeopardy.

714
00:38:04,871 --> 00:38:06,150
Tell me about your father.

715
00:38:06,413 --> 00:38:08,987
My father.
Well, my father. . . .

716
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:10,709
Let's sit here.

717
00:38:11,543 --> 00:38:12,742
My father.

718
00:38:14,171 --> 00:38:16,496
A big man in the neighborhood.
Everybody loved him.

719
00:38:16,757 --> 00:38:18,667
Very well-respected,
God rest his soul.

720
00:38:18,926 --> 00:38:20,336
He passed away?

721
00:38:20,595 --> 00:38:23,548
I just like saying "God rest his soul. "
Of course he passed away!

722
00:38:23,807 --> 00:38:25,467
I was about 1 2 at the time.

723
00:38:25,725 --> 00:38:26,970
How did he die?

724
00:38:27,477 --> 00:38:29,636
It was a sudden thing.
A heart attack.

725
00:38:29,896 --> 00:38:32,220
How was the relationship?
Were you close?

726
00:38:32,481 --> 00:38:33,727
We were pretty close.

727
00:38:33,983 --> 00:38:36,142
We weren't getting along great
right then.

728
00:38:36,403 --> 00:38:37,564
Why is that?

729
00:38:37,946 --> 00:38:40,698
I was hanging out in the neighborhood.
I had a borgata.

730
00:38:41,199 --> 00:38:42,064
What is that?

731
00:38:42,325 --> 00:38:44,780
A kid gang, nothing big.
But he didn't like that.

732
00:38:45,037 --> 00:38:46,032
He didn't approve.

733
00:38:46,288 --> 00:38:48,779
He slapped me around
a couple of times.

734
00:38:49,081 --> 00:38:50,196
And what?

735
00:38:50,459 --> 00:38:51,739
And then he died.

736
00:38:52,336 --> 00:38:54,127
How'd that make you feel?

737
00:38:54,379 --> 00:38:56,834
It felt great, wonderful.
How'd it make me feel?

738
00:38:57,091 --> 00:38:58,086
Think about it.

739
00:38:58,342 --> 00:39:01,462
Were you angry?
Were you afraid? Sad?

740
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:03,629
Maybe all those things.

741
00:39:03,889 --> 00:39:05,134
Any feelings of guilt?

742
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:07,057
About what?
I didn't kill him.

743
00:39:07,308 --> 00:39:08,933
I know that.
I'm just speculating. . .

744
00:39:09,353 --> 00:39:13,053
. . .that maybe in some way
you may have wanted him to die.

745
00:39:13,316 --> 00:39:14,774
Why would I want him to die?

746
00:39:15,026 --> 00:39:17,896
You said you were fighting.
He slapped you around. . .

747
00:39:18,154 --> 00:39:20,312
. . .because you rebelled
against his authority.

748
00:39:20,573 --> 00:39:22,316
Maybe some unresolved
Oedipal conflict.

749
00:39:22,575 --> 00:39:24,234
English, English.

750
00:39:24,493 --> 00:39:28,242
Oedipus was a Greek king who killed
his father and married his mother.

751
00:39:28,498 --> 00:39:29,529
Fucking Greeks.

752
00:39:29,790 --> 00:39:32,080
It's an instinctual
developmental drive.

753
00:39:32,334 --> 00:39:34,328
The young boy wants to
replace his father. . .

754
00:39:34,587 --> 00:39:37,043
. . .so that he can
totally possess his mother.

755
00:39:37,298 --> 00:39:39,456
Are you saying
I wanted to fuck my mother?

756
00:39:39,717 --> 00:39:40,713
It's a primal fantasy.

757
00:39:40,969 --> 00:39:42,796
Have you ever seen my mother?

758
00:39:43,054 --> 00:39:45,094
-Are you out of your mind?
-It's Freud!

759
00:39:45,347 --> 00:39:48,266
Freud's a sick fuck, and you are
too for bringing it up.

760
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:55,314
Can I be honest?
I don 't think I can call you Dad.

761
00:39:55,567 --> 00:39:58,189
So what do I call you?
Do I call you Scott?

762
00:39:58,444 --> 00:40:00,153
My friends call me Captain.

763
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:02,311
Captain?

764
00:40:03,951 --> 00:40:06,488
Want another drink?
I'm definitely having eight or nine.

765
00:40:06,744 --> 00:40:08,026
I'd like a morphine and soda.

766
00:40:08,997 --> 00:40:10,492
I'm shaking.

767
00:40:11,041 --> 00:40:14,541
Shall we go to our table?
Come on, Michael.

768
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:17,661
Seor Sobel.

769
00:40:21,093 --> 00:40:22,338
How you doing?

770
00:40:23,928 --> 00:40:24,924
It's the Vittis.

771
00:40:25,681 --> 00:40:26,712
My God.

772
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:32,014
Everybody's happy.
Everybody's smiling. This is nice.

773
00:40:32,438 --> 00:40:34,097
You're Paul Vitti,
the mobster.

774
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:37,394
Now, is that polite?

775
00:40:38,236 --> 00:40:40,477
Is that being nice?
I'm trying to be nice.

776
00:40:40,737 --> 00:40:43,739
Do I walk up to you and say
you're so-and-so, the hard-on?

777
00:40:44,701 --> 00:40:46,824
This is Laura's father,
the Captain.

778
00:40:47,078 --> 00:40:48,822
I'm very, very sorry.

779
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:50,195
Excuse us.

780
00:40:52,708 --> 00:40:54,700
I heard about the wedding.
Here you go.

781
00:40:54,961 --> 00:40:58,210
A little something for the
bride and groom. God bless.

782
00:40:58,590 --> 00:40:59,669
We can't accept this.

783
00:40:59,923 --> 00:41:01,418
-Yes, you can.
-Thank you.

784
00:41:01,676 --> 00:41:05,176
I'm just gonna borrow this guy.
I'll bring him right back.

785
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:07,090
And then you'll leave us alone.

786
00:41:07,349 --> 00:41:08,759
I'll leave you alone.

787
00:41:09,017 --> 00:41:10,262
I got to talk to you.

788
00:41:12,062 --> 00:41:13,721
Two minutes.
Two minutes.

789
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:16,554
Wait over there.
Don't listen to what we say.

790
00:41:16,817 --> 00:41:18,192
My ears are sealed.

791
00:41:18,443 --> 00:41:20,270
I had a weird dream
last night.

792
00:41:20,529 --> 00:41:23,483
I feel like I'm having one now.
Why'd you interrupt my party?

793
00:41:23,741 --> 00:41:26,232
You're really very rigid
about certain things.

794
00:41:26,492 --> 00:41:27,774
Did you know that?

795
00:41:28,037 --> 00:41:30,325
All right,
tell me about your dream.

796
00:41:30,581 --> 00:41:32,157
I'm asleep.

797
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:34,954
I hear a baby crying.
I go to the refrigerator.

798
00:41:35,211 --> 00:41:36,705
I get him a bottle of milk.

799
00:41:36,961 --> 00:41:38,705
I bring the bottle of milk to him. . .

800
00:41:38,964 --> 00:41:40,245
. . .I see the milk is black.

801
00:41:40,508 --> 00:41:42,050
That's fucking weird!

802
00:41:42,301 --> 00:41:43,131
Get out of here.

803
00:41:43,386 --> 00:41:45,094
-Get out of here.
-Sorry.

804
00:41:46,097 --> 00:41:49,132
What does that mean?
And no more filth about my mother.

805
00:41:49,392 --> 00:41:51,301
I don't know.
What does it mean to you?

806
00:41:52,270 --> 00:41:55,353
This is why I pay you? I say
something, you say it back to me?

807
00:41:55,606 --> 00:41:57,765
I could get Jelly to
do that for nothing.

808
00:41:58,026 --> 00:42:00,599
Get Jelly.
I'm going back to my party.

809
00:42:02,571 --> 00:42:04,647
All right.
I'm letting it go this time.

810
00:42:04,908 --> 00:42:07,992
Because you're getting married,
I'm gonna let it go.

811
00:42:11,790 --> 00:42:15,740
Why don't you look over that way
before I bust your head open?

812
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:32,927
I'm gonna grab a bite to eat.
You want a sandwich?

813
00:42:33,437 --> 00:42:35,559
What kind of sandwich
ain't too fattening?

814
00:42:35,814 --> 00:42:37,356
A half a sandwich.

815
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:39,809
I'll be back in a few minutes.

816
00:43:10,683 --> 00:43:13,353
Now, nod your head and smile.
Do it.

817
00:43:14,228 --> 00:43:15,888
Now, you listen to me, goombah.

818
00:43:16,147 --> 00:43:19,018
I know what your game is,
and you'd better call it quits.

819
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:22,977
If you and your paisans
do anything to hurt my little girl. . .

820
00:43:23,238 --> 00:43:24,780
. . .I don't care who
you are. . .

821
00:43:25,031 --> 00:43:28,317
. . .I'll hunt you down like
the dog you are, and I'll kill you.

822
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:29,905
Understand?

823
00:43:30,287 --> 00:43:32,078
Now, nod and smile.

824
00:43:32,581 --> 00:43:33,826
Congratulations.

825
00:43:37,502 --> 00:43:38,617
What was that about?

826
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:41,880
Just guy stuff between
me and the Captain.

827
00:44:47,657 --> 00:44:48,689
Shit!

828
00:44:51,952 --> 00:44:54,527
In sickness and in health,
from this day forth. . .

829
00:44:54,790 --> 00:44:56,913
. . .as long as you both shall live?

830
00:45:06,050 --> 00:45:08,589
Bring Marie and
the kids right to the airport.

831
00:45:08,846 --> 00:45:12,594
Pull the car in the
back of the hotel and wait for us.

832
00:45:12,849 --> 00:45:13,763
You got it, boss.

833
00:45:14,018 --> 00:45:16,638
That's it. That is it!
I've had it with you.

834
00:45:16,896 --> 00:45:17,890
-What happened?
-What happened?

835
00:45:18,147 --> 00:45:21,979
I just saw a man fall seven stories
into a platter of poached salmon!

836
00:45:22,233 --> 00:45:24,026
-Did he break anything?
-Everything!

837
00:45:24,277 --> 00:45:25,938
They're still pulling capers
out of him.

838
00:45:26,197 --> 00:45:29,981
People get depressed, they jump.
It's a tragedy, but it ain't my fault.

839
00:45:30,242 --> 00:45:31,820
You're telling me
it was a suicide?

840
00:45:32,077 --> 00:45:34,532
I think he left a note.
Jelly, did they find it?

841
00:45:34,788 --> 00:45:36,698
No, but they will in a minute.

842
00:45:36,958 --> 00:45:39,034
Let me guess what it says.
"Life is bullshit.

843
00:45:39,335 --> 00:45:41,540
I can't take it no more.
Signed, The Dead Guy. "

844
00:45:41,796 --> 00:45:43,753
That's good, Doc.

845
00:45:44,007 --> 00:45:46,130
Enough talk.
We gotta get out of here.

846
00:45:46,384 --> 00:45:47,962
There's feds all over.

847
00:45:48,218 --> 00:45:50,045
I'm going back to New York. . .

848
00:45:50,304 --> 00:45:53,092
. . .and I would suggest that
you do the same thing.

849
00:45:53,349 --> 00:45:55,093
Because they're probably
onto you too.

850
00:45:55,351 --> 00:45:57,309
Onto me?
What are you talking about?

851
00:45:57,562 --> 00:46:00,977
Being an accessory to a murder
wasn't part of our understanding.

852
00:46:01,232 --> 00:46:02,809
I didn't kill nobody.

853
00:46:03,068 --> 00:46:04,895
I can't speak for
other people here.

854
00:46:05,153 --> 00:46:06,149
He tried to kill me.

855
00:46:06,404 --> 00:46:09,073
God forbid he did that
to somebody in my family.

856
00:46:09,324 --> 00:46:11,612
It would've been
a double or a triple tragedy.

857
00:46:11,868 --> 00:46:14,156
Trust me, in this case,
we're the good guys.

858
00:46:14,412 --> 00:46:15,527
Where is he?

859
00:46:16,665 --> 00:46:18,953
-Where are you going?
-Don't touch me.

860
00:46:20,084 --> 00:46:21,496
How could you do that?

861
00:46:21,753 --> 00:46:23,545
Another country heard from.

862
00:46:24,131 --> 00:46:25,126
Wait downstairs.

863
00:46:25,382 --> 00:46:28,584
Why? Are they going to throw me
off the balcony too?

864
00:46:29,136 --> 00:46:31,626
You're upset, and
you're upsetting me.

865
00:46:31,889 --> 00:46:32,920
Of course I'm upset!

866
00:46:33,181 --> 00:46:36,467
My wedding is ruined
because you've got problems!

867
00:46:36,726 --> 00:46:37,758
I got problems?

868
00:46:38,521 --> 00:46:39,351
Honey, please.

869
00:46:40,355 --> 00:46:43,191
I'm going to pack,
and then I'm going to New York.

870
00:46:43,442 --> 00:46:46,360
And I am getting married with you
or without you!

871
00:46:47,071 --> 00:46:49,111
With! With!
I'm sorry, honey.

872
00:46:49,365 --> 00:46:51,156
It'll all work out.
I promise.

873
00:46:51,408 --> 00:46:52,737
Please?

874
00:46:53,619 --> 00:46:55,244
No, I hate you!

875
00:46:56,873 --> 00:46:58,865
Are you happy?
Are you happy?

876
00:46:59,124 --> 00:47:01,414
You know what you did?
You ruined my life!

877
00:47:01,669 --> 00:47:03,543
Happy?
What are you talking about?

878
00:47:03,796 --> 00:47:06,002
You think I wanted this?
I'm a victim here.

879
00:47:06,257 --> 00:47:07,586
I can't believe this guy.

880
00:47:07,842 --> 00:47:10,084
He tries to kill me,
then whacks one of my guys.

881
00:47:10,345 --> 00:47:13,796
On top of that, he fucks up your
wedding. You know how upset I am?

882
00:47:14,057 --> 00:47:16,762
I'm so enraged, I don't know
what to do with myself!

883
00:47:17,018 --> 00:47:19,474
Plus, I'm trying to
get out of this hotel and--

884
00:47:19,729 --> 00:47:21,354
Are you listening to yourself?

885
00:47:21,605 --> 00:47:22,769
Listen to yourself!

886
00:47:23,024 --> 00:47:27,152
This has been a disaster from the
moment you stepped foot in my office.

887
00:47:27,403 --> 00:47:30,025
That is it. Over!
I'm no longer your doctor.

888
00:47:30,282 --> 00:47:31,443
Just because of this?

889
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:34,986
Because of this little double homicide?
Yes, because of this!

890
00:47:35,245 --> 00:47:38,697
You don't have a shred
of human decency. Not a shred.

891
00:47:38,957 --> 00:47:40,866
I actually thought
I could help you.

892
00:47:41,126 --> 00:47:43,582
There's no helping you.
You're a common thug!

893
00:47:43,837 --> 00:47:45,462
Nobody in the world
could help you!

894
00:47:45,714 --> 00:47:47,292
All right!
What do you want me to do?

895
00:47:52,513 --> 00:47:53,972
Let me speak to Primo.

896
00:47:54,223 --> 00:47:55,088
Hold on.

897
00:47:57,559 --> 00:47:59,220
Paul Vitti's on the phone.

898
00:48:09,697 --> 00:48:10,942
-Who is this?
-It's me.

899
00:48:11,198 --> 00:48:13,274
-Me who?
-Me who-- Me, me.

900
00:48:13,534 --> 00:48:16,239
-Me? Me who?
-Me, me. You know me. Me.

901
00:48:16,912 --> 00:48:18,158
Yeah, how's it going?

902
00:48:18,413 --> 00:48:19,528
Not good.
Not good.

903
00:48:19,791 --> 00:48:22,745
Whoever did that thing to
you-know-who, my good friend. . .

904
00:48:23,002 --> 00:48:24,378
. . .is trying to do that to me.

905
00:48:24,628 --> 00:48:27,037
And I'm having a lot
of feelings about that.

906
00:48:27,339 --> 00:48:29,748
And I'm trying to get some. . . .

907
00:48:30,010 --> 00:48:32,132
-Closure.
-Closure on that.

908
00:48:33,847 --> 00:48:35,721
What kind of feelings?

909
00:48:35,974 --> 00:48:38,890
I'm very angry.
I'm feeling very angry about that.

910
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:41,683
I'm enraged.

911
00:48:41,937 --> 00:48:44,144
I'm feeling very,
very mad about that.

912
00:48:44,399 --> 00:48:45,596
Why are you telling me?

913
00:48:45,859 --> 00:48:47,234
Why am I telling you?

914
00:48:47,486 --> 00:48:49,562
Like you don't know
nothing about it?

915
00:48:49,821 --> 00:48:51,197
You don't know nothing?
What?

916
00:48:51,615 --> 00:48:53,442
I don't know what
you're talking about.

917
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:55,278
-I'm trying to. . . .
-Tell you how I feel.

918
00:48:55,536 --> 00:48:58,026
Tell you about my feelings
and that. . . .

919
00:48:58,372 --> 00:48:59,747
-I'm angry.
-I'm angry.

920
00:48:59,999 --> 00:49:01,326
And anger is a. . . .

921
00:49:01,583 --> 00:49:03,290
-A blocked wish.
-A blocked wish.

922
00:49:03,544 --> 00:49:06,793
And I'm looking forward to seeing
you next week at that thing.

923
00:49:07,047 --> 00:49:09,585
Then I can unblock
that angered wish. . .

924
00:49:09,842 --> 00:49:10,754
. . .and then hopefully. . . .

925
00:49:11,010 --> 00:49:13,465
You make one more move on me,
you motherfucker. . .

926
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:15,630
. . .I'll fucking cut
your fucking balls off!

927
00:49:15,890 --> 00:49:19,222
I'll shove them up your fucking ass!
I'll fucking bury you!

928
00:49:19,476 --> 00:49:22,478
I'll put ice picks in your eyes!
I'll chop your eyeballs!

929
00:49:22,730 --> 00:49:25,435
I'll send them to your family
to eat for dessert!

930
00:49:25,690 --> 00:49:27,020
You understand me?

931
00:49:27,860 --> 00:49:29,140
-What?
-Fuck you.

932
00:49:29,403 --> 00:49:31,195
You motherfucker!

933
00:49:33,950 --> 00:49:36,986
You get a dictionary and find out
what this "closure" is.

934
00:49:37,245 --> 00:49:41,373
If that's what he's going to hit us
with, I want to know what it is.

935
00:49:41,624 --> 00:49:42,953
How was that?

936
00:49:43,626 --> 00:49:45,251
It was going great until. . .

937
00:49:45,502 --> 00:49:48,207
. . .the cutting off of the balls
and shoving it up. . .

938
00:49:48,465 --> 00:49:49,710
. . .his ass.

939
00:49:50,091 --> 00:49:53,128
You know what I do when I'm mad?
I hit a pillow.

940
00:49:53,385 --> 00:49:55,094
Just hit the pillow.
See how you feel.

941
00:50:00,142 --> 00:50:01,935
There's your fucking pillow.

942
00:50:03,105 --> 00:50:04,267
Feel better?

943
00:50:06,066 --> 00:50:07,264
Yeah, I do.

944
00:50:07,526 --> 00:50:08,771
Good.

945
00:50:23,499 --> 00:50:26,288
Call the Vatican.
See if something is missing.

946
00:50:26,628 --> 00:50:27,956
So cool!

947
00:50:30,132 --> 00:50:32,670
I need to talk to your dad
in private, okay?

948
00:50:32,926 --> 00:50:34,669
Would you unload the car, please?

949
00:50:34,929 --> 00:50:37,716
It's almost as tall as the house.

950
00:50:40,977 --> 00:50:42,601
What is going on?

951
00:50:43,062 --> 00:50:44,438
What is this?

952
00:50:45,315 --> 00:50:46,690
Why?

953
00:50:47,108 --> 00:50:49,942
It's a wedding gift.
He felt bad for the--

954
00:50:50,193 --> 00:50:54,192
Well, we're not married,
so we can just send it back.

955
00:50:56,785 --> 00:50:58,861
It was not my fault.
Everybody was there.

956
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:01,824
You didn't want to
go ahead with the ceremony.

957
00:51:02,081 --> 00:51:06,032
What did you expect? That's not what
I want for an anniversary memory.

958
00:51:06,293 --> 00:51:09,628
Look at our wedding video.
There are your parents, and mine.

959
00:51:09,881 --> 00:51:12,123
There's the guy that
plunged to his death.

960
00:51:12,384 --> 00:51:14,507
I just want to marry you.

961
00:51:15,345 --> 00:51:16,970
I'm thinking it'll never happen.

962
00:51:17,221 --> 00:51:20,009
It's happening next Saturday
at the Waldorf.

963
00:51:20,267 --> 00:51:21,464
And who'll be there?

964
00:51:21,727 --> 00:51:22,972
We three, the clergyman. . .

965
00:51:23,228 --> 00:51:26,727
. . .and any of your family who
are done with their crisis counseling.

966
00:51:26,982 --> 00:51:29,473
No guests without necks.
Everybody has to have a neck.

967
00:51:29,734 --> 00:51:31,893
We will do a neck check
at the door.
