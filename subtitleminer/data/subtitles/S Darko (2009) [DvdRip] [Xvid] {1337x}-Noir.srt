- Only two more good mornings.
- Only one more day.

00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:21,118
- We're so perfect.
- Immaculate.

00:04:59,828 --> 00:05:02,023
- Kill it!
- What?

19
00:05:02,097 --> 00:05:04,156
Turn it off!

20
00:05:12,707 --> 00:05:14,641
Doesn't look too good.

21
00:05:14,709 --> 00:05:17,269
Okay. Well, now what?

22
00:05:22,517 --> 00:05:24,451
We wait?

23
00:05:26,021 --> 00:05:27,955
For?

24
00:05:28,023 --> 00:05:30,014
Anything.

25
00:05:31,493 --> 00:05:33,961
That's your plan.

26
00:05:34,029 --> 00:05:35,963
You got a better one?

27
00:06:53,708 --> 00:06:56,438
Sam, wake up.
Someone's coming.

28
00:07:04,786 --> 00:07:07,152
Hey.

29
00:07:11,493 --> 00:07:14,519
- What's goin' on?
- Our car broke down.

30
00:07:14,596 --> 00:07:16,928
Your friend okay?

31
00:07:16,998 --> 00:07:18,989
She's dead.

32
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:25,067
Roadkill.

33
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:27,074
Froze to death.

34
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:30,744
Yeah, that happens.

35
00:07:40,622 --> 00:07:42,556
You all right?

36
00:07:43,558 --> 00:07:45,458
Fine.

37
00:07:45,527 --> 00:07:49,361
See, she's an ice queen.
You need a flamethrower to get inside that.

38
00:07:53,501 --> 00:07:56,197
- So, you want me to take a look?
- Where?

39
00:07:56,271 --> 00:07:58,933
- Under the hood.
- Sure.

40
00:08:01,543 --> 00:08:03,477
Ow.

41
00:08:05,947 --> 00:08:08,415
<i>Well, you can't drive it.</i>

42
00:08:08,483 --> 00:08:12,317
<i>Look, Conejo Springs is just up the road.
I can give you a ride.</i>

43
00:08:23,364 --> 00:08:26,993
Water pump's gone. I can order you a new one.
Might take a day or two.

44
00:08:27,068 --> 00:08:29,798
<i>- How much?
- Oh, couple of hundred. Maybe more.</i>

45
00:08:29,871 --> 00:08:32,135
<i>Is this the only show
in town, or-</i>

46
00:08:32,207 --> 00:08:34,801
You want me to charge you
for that tow, no problem.

47
00:08:34,876 --> 00:08:38,243
That's a hundred bucks right there.
But it's free for customers.

48
00:08:38,313 --> 00:08:41,771
- Oh, so that's how you do it.
- I could fix it.

49
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:45,013
<i>Is it all right if I look around
in your junkyard, Mr. Pickford?</i>

50
00:08:45,086 --> 00:08:47,020
Parts is parts.

51
00:08:47,088 --> 00:08:49,784
You never know.
You just might get lucky.

52
00:08:49,858 --> 00:08:53,157
<i>- Mmm.
- What?</i>

53
00:08:53,228 --> 00:08:55,196
- Might get lucky.
- He didn't mean it like that.

54
00:08:55,263 --> 00:08:57,458
- Mm-hmm. Parts is parts.
- Leave me alone.

55
00:08:57,532 --> 00:09:00,592
<i>- You guys need a ride to the motel?
- Hell, yeah.</i>

56
00:09:00,668 --> 00:09:04,627
- How far is it?
- Just around the corner- like everything.

57
00:09:04,706 --> 00:09:08,608
- Well, we could walk.
- What about your stuff?

58
00:09:08,676 --> 00:09:11,167
- Empty bags of chips are yours.
- And the hula hoop?

59
00:09:15,884 --> 00:09:18,682
So, can we, like, get a bottle
on the way, or something?

60
00:09:18,753 --> 00:09:20,687
It's a free country.

61
00:09:20,755 --> 00:09:23,588
Oh, well, I guess
you got yourself a job, mister.

62
00:09:54,889 --> 00:09:56,914
<i>Thanks.</i>

63
00:10:00,061 --> 00:10:01,995
So you guys want me to wait?

64
00:10:02,063 --> 00:10:05,726
Oh, we can handle it ourselves.

65
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,791
Well, you got my number.

66
00:10:09,938 --> 00:10:11,769
What is wrong with you?

67
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,774
Nothing.

68
00:10:13,842 --> 00:10:16,276
Can't you even pretend to be happy?

69
00:10:30,325 --> 00:10:32,418
However, Marcia Clark
may have to reschedule-

70
00:10:34,295 --> 00:10:36,729
Judge Ito will determine
later today-

71
00:10:36,798 --> 00:10:39,699
Space shuttle ain't blastin' off
till next month.

72
00:10:39,767 --> 00:10:42,201
<i>- Is that a fact?
- Oh.</i>

73
00:10:44,205 --> 00:10:48,335
<i>You gals not with
the Star Trek club, are you?</i>

74
00:10:48,409 --> 00:10:53,574
<i>- Got wait-listed.
- It's a pretty picky bunch. What can I do you for?</i>

75
00:10:53,648 --> 00:10:55,582
We need a room.

76
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:57,811
Oh. Only got one that's finished.

77
00:10:59,921 --> 00:11:02,219
In the process of beautifyin'.

78
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:04,383
- How much is it?
- How many you stayin'?

79
00:11:04,459 --> 00:11:08,088
- Forever, we hope.
- Just a couple.

80
00:11:08,162 --> 00:11:10,630
I'll give you the daily rate.

81
00:11:12,233 --> 00:11:14,258
Honeymoon suite.

82
00:11:14,335 --> 00:11:16,235
What happened to that little boy?

83
00:11:16,304 --> 00:11:18,738
Oh.

84
00:11:18,806 --> 00:11:23,675
<i>He went missin'.
Not the first around here neither.</i>

85
00:11:23,745 --> 00:11:27,841
Kids, they do the darndest things.

86
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:31,147
<i>Well, don't worry about us.
We're little angels.</i>

87
00:12:00,181 --> 00:12:03,014
A little ketchup up at the top.

88
00:12:06,187 --> 00:12:08,985
There we go.
All right, you ready?

89
00:12:09,057 --> 00:12:11,321
It's this simple.
How long is this gonna take, champ?

90
00:12:11,392 --> 00:12:13,519
Well, less than two minutes.

91
00:12:13,594 --> 00:12:16,654
- Say that again.
- Less than two minutes.

92
00:12:19,267 --> 00:12:21,258
Two minutes?

93
00:12:41,389 --> 00:12:46,554
Everything will be cold and dark.

94
00:12:47,996 --> 00:12:49,987
<i>Are you ready to die?</i>

95
00:13:04,479 --> 00:13:06,413
Are you afraid?

96
00:13:07,882 --> 00:13:09,816
I'm a good soldier.

97
00:13:09,884 --> 00:13:11,818
<i>Everything dies.</i>

98
00:13:14,422 --> 00:13:16,356
She told me you would come.

99
00:13:16,424 --> 00:13:18,824
Shh.

100
00:13:24,599 --> 00:13:26,533
<i>Save yourself.</i>

101
00:13:31,072 --> 00:13:34,872
Four days, 17 hours...

102
00:13:34,942 --> 00:13:39,038
26 minutes, 31 seconds.

103
00:13:40,314 --> 00:13:43,408
That is when the world will end.

104
00:13:52,994 --> 00:13:54,928
Follow me.

105
00:14:36,204 --> 00:14:39,640
I'm afraid I can't
let you sleep here.

106
00:14:39,707 --> 00:14:41,698
Must've been quite a night.

107
00:14:43,578 --> 00:14:46,206
You got anyplace to be?

108
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:49,215
Oh, I'm sure somebody's
waitin' for you somewhere.

109
00:14:49,283 --> 00:14:52,844
My friend Corey- at the motel.

110
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:56,720
Come on. Up you go.

111
00:14:58,025 --> 00:14:59,959
Upsy-daisy.

112
00:15:03,831 --> 00:15:05,822
You know, there's a pervert
loose in town.

113
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:08,869
Goes by Iraq Jack,
but that ain't his real name.

114
00:15:08,936 --> 00:15:13,267
Can't be, uh, dressin' like-
like that.

115
00:15:15,903 --> 00:15:18,030
The one who took, uh,
the little boy?

116
00:15:18,106 --> 00:15:21,542
It ain't a proven fact,
but I'd bet the farm on it.

117
00:15:21,609 --> 00:15:24,271
I- I support Desert Storm
and everything...

118
00:15:24,345 --> 00:15:28,111
but when the boys come home
with voices in their head...

119
00:15:28,182 --> 00:15:31,618
then it becomes my problem.

120
00:15:31,686 --> 00:15:34,655
<i>O'Dell, respond to
a 211 at Frank Pickford's place.</i>

121
00:15:34,722 --> 00:15:36,713
Copy. 10-17.

122
00:15:38,726 --> 00:15:41,058
Tell you what. Hop in.
I'll give you a ride.

123
00:15:41,129 --> 00:15:43,063
It's right by the motel.

124
00:16:13,361 --> 00:16:17,855
Unbelievable. Do you know how much
that old windmill was worth?

125
00:16:17,932 --> 00:16:22,767
<i>Sell this thing off to some
meteorological nerd club, you might just do okay.</i>

126
00:16:22,837 --> 00:16:26,136
<i>- Really? You think?
- I'd sure like to borrow it.</i>

127
00:16:26,207 --> 00:16:29,074
It's a message in a bottle
from aliens, right?

128
00:16:31,145 --> 00:16:33,375
That was almost funny, Pete,
you meathead.

129
00:16:33,447 --> 00:16:37,474
- What is all this stuff?
- Oh, it's that nut job, Iraq Jack.

130
00:16:37,552 --> 00:16:40,020
He's been squattin' up there
for a couple of months now...

131
00:16:40,087 --> 00:16:45,252
yellin' crap about the Acropolis
and universe justice or somethin'.

132
00:16:45,326 --> 00:16:49,888
<i>If there was any real justice left in this country,
he'd be hangin' by a noose right now.</i>

133
00:16:51,032 --> 00:16:54,798
Big ol' horseshit
from the sky if you ask me.

134
00:17:04,378 --> 00:17:06,938
That is some crazy shit.

135
00:17:07,014 --> 00:17:09,448
This town's got way beyond
its quota of crazy shit.

136
00:17:09,517 --> 00:17:13,681
- So where'd you sleepwalk to last night?
- Bus stop.

137
00:17:13,754 --> 00:17:17,053
<i>Do you remember anything this time?</i>

138
00:17:17,124 --> 00:17:20,525
<i>Nothing. Just blackness.</i>

139
00:17:20,595 --> 00:17:24,531
So I'm havin' a Fourth of July party later on.
You guys should come.

140
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:26,692
<i>Fourth of July
is still four days away.</i>

141
00:17:26,767 --> 00:17:28,667
If you're stuck here, you might as well
have some fun. Right?

142
00:17:28,736 --> 00:17:31,432
- What about that water pump?
- I'll look for it later.

143
00:17:31,505 --> 00:17:34,804
- After you're done getting wasted?
- Oh, chill out.

144
00:17:42,683 --> 00:17:45,618
<i>- That really sucks.
- Being lost?</i>

145
00:17:45,686 --> 00:17:48,305
<i>- If I go missing, will you make
sure I look hot on my poster?</i>

146
00:17:48,306 --> 00:17:49,019
<i>Deal.</i>

147
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:51,115
Take it easy, Trudy.

148
00:17:51,192 --> 00:17:53,126
Jesus loves you, Agatha.

149
00:17:53,194 --> 00:17:55,389
<i>Uh-huh.
Have a good one.</i>

150
00:17:55,463 --> 00:17:57,795
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

151
00:17:57,865 --> 00:18:01,164
- So, where you girls from?
- Uh, Virginia.

152
00:18:01,235 --> 00:18:03,965
I'm from Boise. Idaho.

153
00:18:04,038 --> 00:18:06,199
Watermelon Queen
for two years runnin'.

154
00:18:06,274 --> 00:18:08,936
- But I don't like to brag.
- Oh, you still got it.

155
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:14,312
Oh, will you look at that
piece of filth out there?

156
00:18:14,382 --> 00:18:15,865
He's probably just hungry.

157
00:18:15,866 --> 00:18:18,944
Oh, no. That one don't deserve your pity.
Trust me.

158
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:21,318
<i>He should've died
up on that windmill.</i>

159
00:18:21,389 --> 00:18:25,325
I was thinking
we chop off his balls and stone him.

160
00:18:25,393 --> 00:18:27,588
Light him on fire
if gas wasn't so expensive.

161
00:18:27,662 --> 00:18:30,062
You girls stay away from him, okay?

162
00:18:30,131 --> 00:18:34,500
<i>And let me know if you need anything-
anything at all.</i>

163
00:18:34,568 --> 00:18:36,229
<i>- Orange soda, please.
- Surely.</i>

164
00:18:43,577 --> 00:18:45,602
Can we help you?

165
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:49,616
I'm sorry. I-I just recognized you.
I saw you by the motel.

166
00:18:49,684 --> 00:18:51,618
Pretty amazing stuff, huh?

167
00:18:51,686 --> 00:18:55,053
I- I just made a deal
to buy it for $600.

168
00:18:55,122 --> 00:18:58,580
- What's "it"?
- The meteorite.

169
00:18:58,659 --> 00:19:00,854
What the hell are you gonna do
with a friggin' meteor?

170
00:19:00,928 --> 00:19:03,260
<i>A meteorite, actually.</i>

171
00:19:03,331 --> 00:19:08,633
<i>Uh, well, I gotta run some tests,
but, if I had to guess, I'd say it's a siderite.</i>

172
00:19:08,703 --> 00:19:10,898
They're mostly composed
of iron and nickel.

173
00:19:13,007 --> 00:19:14,702
I'm Jeremy.

174
00:19:14,775 --> 00:19:17,573
- Are you a gay?
- What?

175
00:19:17,645 --> 00:19:19,545
Isn't Jeremy a gay name?

176
00:19:21,082 --> 00:19:23,277
- Enjoy your soda, sweetheart.
- Thank you.

177
00:19:23,351 --> 00:19:26,047
Okay, as soon as she walks
to the kitchen, run for it.

178
00:19:45,873 --> 00:19:49,309
I don't think you're a gay.

179
00:19:54,348 --> 00:19:56,782
Don't you think we should,
like, call your dad...

180
00:19:56,851 --> 00:19:58,944
and tell him that we're coming?

181
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:01,011
Nah. I don't want him
to get worried.

182
00:20:01,088 --> 00:20:03,022
You don't want him to say no.

183
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:06,287
Look, I just don't want
to be a burden, okay?

184
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:09,523
Relax. He still owns
the club, all right?

185
00:20:09,597 --> 00:20:12,361
He's gonna get us both jobs.
I'm his daughter, for Chrissake.

186
00:20:12,433 --> 00:20:14,924
- Yeah, but he's still a guy.
- Yeah.

187
00:20:15,002 --> 00:20:19,530
And he knows this is pissing my mom off
to no end, which is totally in our favor.

188
00:20:19,607 --> 00:20:22,269
Your mom was really cool to me.

189
00:20:22,343 --> 00:20:25,744
Doesn't mean anything.
She just used you to get younger guys.

190
00:20:25,813 --> 00:20:28,373
At least I'm good for something.

191
00:20:28,449 --> 00:20:30,610
<i>Ever tag-team a 40-year-old?</i>

192
00:20:30,684 --> 00:20:32,618
- Don't.
- Hey.

193
00:20:36,524 --> 00:20:40,119
- You girls new in town?
- Just passing through.

194
00:20:40,194 --> 00:20:42,128
<i>Well, if you're gonna be around
a little while...</i>

195
00:20:42,196 --> 00:20:44,824
you might as well stop
and get some pizza at my Bible study.

196
00:20:44,899 --> 00:20:46,992
- It's a lot of fun.
- Oh, I'm satanic.

197
00:20:47,068 --> 00:20:50,970
She's half Jehovah, quarter Jew,
tiny bit retarded.

198
00:20:51,038 --> 00:20:53,598
<i>Mmm. Well, we're nondenominational.</i>

199
00:20:53,674 --> 00:20:57,337
We accept all types,
even those with horns.

200
00:20:57,411 --> 00:21:01,575
- What's it like to never be able to have sex?
- Excuse me?

201
00:21:01,649 --> 00:21:03,640
Do you just have
blue balls all the time...

202
00:21:03,717 --> 00:21:06,151
or you just have to spank it
constantly?

203
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:10,623
Well, I haven't always had
a personal relationship with the Lord.

204
00:21:10,691 --> 00:21:15,993
But I'm not missing anything.
I used to be just like you.

205
00:21:16,063 --> 00:21:18,429
<i>- What, you had a training bra?
- Not exactly.</i>

206
00:21:18,499 --> 00:21:20,592
But when I was your age,
I experienced things...

207
00:21:20,668 --> 00:21:22,863
that made me feel
like God didn't exist.

208
00:21:24,305 --> 00:21:27,240
Maybe you've experienced
something like that too.

209
00:21:27,308 --> 00:21:30,835
- You don't know anything about me.
- I can see that you're in pain.

210
00:21:30,911 --> 00:21:34,904
- I'm alive.
- Is that how you see life?

211
00:21:34,982 --> 00:21:38,179
Till farts taste
like cherries, yeah.

212
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:41,383
What do you think
God's farts taste like?

213
00:21:41,455 --> 00:21:44,185
Marshmallow Peeps.

214
00:21:44,258 --> 00:21:46,556
Well, you can make fun all you want.

215
00:21:47,695 --> 00:21:49,686
But that's just denial.

216
00:21:49,763 --> 00:21:51,196
Blow me.

217
00:21:54,702 --> 00:21:57,364
You make up your own mind.

218
00:21:57,438 --> 00:22:00,635
Read these words.

219
00:22:00,708 --> 00:22:03,040
God has all the time
in the world for you.

220
00:22:03,244 --> 00:22:06,771
Four days, nine hours...

221
00:22:08,782 --> 00:22:10,716
<i>five minutes...</i>

222
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:17,154
39 seconds, 38 seconds...

223
00:22:17,224 --> 00:22:21,354
37 seconds, 36 seconds...

224
00:22:21,428 --> 00:22:25,421
35 seconds, 34 seconds...

225
00:22:25,499 --> 00:22:27,933
33 seconds-

226
00:22:29,203 --> 00:22:31,137
Frank know you're in here?

227
00:22:33,974 --> 00:22:36,067
Does he?

228
00:22:36,143 --> 00:22:38,475
I killed babies-

229
00:22:38,546 --> 00:22:42,983
<i>brains spilling out of their heads
like macaroni.</i>

230
00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:46,417
Tiny feet with little baby toes
blown off just-

231
00:22:46,487 --> 00:22:48,614
just lying in the road.

232
00:22:48,689 --> 00:22:52,489
You know, if you didn't dress and talk like that,
man, people wouldn't be so freaked out.

233
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:55,723
<i>At least, lose the slingshot.</i>

234
00:22:55,796 --> 00:22:59,926
No. How would I fight back?

235
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:05,666
All right. Keep the slingshot.
Lose the "camo. "

236
00:23:05,739 --> 00:23:08,674
No. I- No.

237
00:23:09,777 --> 00:23:11,711
Then they could see me.

238
00:23:11,779 --> 00:23:15,875
Look, you'd better get outta here
before Frank comes back.

239
00:23:22,523 --> 00:23:26,550
- They made me do it.
- Who?

240
00:23:26,627 --> 00:23:29,619
- The leaders.
- Okay.

241
00:23:29,697 --> 00:23:31,995
She needs me.

242
00:23:32,066 --> 00:23:34,000
Who?

243
00:23:34,068 --> 00:23:37,629
- The princess.
- Right.

244
00:23:37,705 --> 00:23:40,401
Look, she saved me.

245
00:23:40,474 --> 00:23:42,465
She can- She can do anything.

246
00:23:45,946 --> 00:23:50,144
- She can even save Billy.
- What you know about Billy?

247
00:23:52,019 --> 00:23:54,453
Don't believe the milk carton.

248
00:23:54,521 --> 00:23:58,184
Get down!

249
00:24:00,928 --> 00:24:04,659
- Hey! Hey, can you hear me?
- You don't have to scream.

250
00:24:04,732 --> 00:24:06,996
You need to tell them, okay?
You tell everyone!

251
00:24:07,067 --> 00:24:10,901
- Tell 'em what?
- The world is going to end!

252
00:24:24,251 --> 00:24:27,220

So, uh...

why'd you come to this one?

Well, I guess I thought,
you know, maybe if-

00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,724
Hey. You might wanna

- Are you okay?
- Don't be so annoying.

289
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:40,550
So, um, you should come and check out
the club when it's all set up.

290
00:26:40,621 --> 00:26:42,555
You get V.I.P. treatment.

291
00:26:42,623 --> 00:26:45,854
You know, I can't say
I haven't thought about it.

292

00:28:41,608 --> 00:28:45,009
He just disappeared.

<i>Like Billy Moorcroft?</i>

it could be the same guy.

touch anything.</i>

<i>- What about your mom?
- She bailed.</i>

306
00:29:41,101 --> 00:29:43,535
She was kind of a bitch anyway.

307
00:29:45,572 --> 00:29:49,064
If you want to
sit on the bed, you can.

308
00:29:49,142 --> 00:29:51,133
That's what the plastic's for.

309
00:29:57,284 --> 00:29:59,013
So what's it like in-

310
00:29:59,086 --> 00:30:02,112
- Virginia.
- Virginia.

311
00:30:02,189 --> 00:30:04,384
It sucks.

312
00:30:04,458 --> 00:30:08,417
It's like everybody knows
everything about me...

313
00:30:08,495 --> 00:30:12,522
but I'm invisible at the same time.

314
00:30:12,599 --> 00:30:14,866
So it's like
the worst of both worlds.

315
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,434
Well, in high school...

316
00:30:17,502 --> 00:30:19,561
if you're not invisible,
you're an asshole.

317
00:30:19,638 --> 00:30:21,538
- Or a teacher.
- Or both.

318
00:30:29,848 --> 00:30:32,408
So you got brothers and sisters?

319
00:30:33,785 --> 00:30:35,776
A sister.

320
00:30:38,323 --> 00:30:40,257
Got married.

321
00:30:40,325 --> 00:30:42,486
Made tons of money,
made a new family.

322
00:30:43,628 --> 00:30:45,562
Never see her anymore.

323
00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:47,564
<i>Damn.</i>

324
00:30:49,968 --> 00:30:52,903
Sometimes it just feels like...

325
00:30:52,971 --> 00:30:55,838
- I could-
- Like what?

326
00:30:55,907 --> 00:30:59,070
I don't know.

327
00:30:59,144 --> 00:31:01,305
Sometimes I just wish I could...

328
00:31:03,915 --> 00:31:07,976
switch places
with someone, you know?

329
00:31:08,053 --> 00:31:10,578
That why you're goin'
to California-

330
00:31:11,957 --> 00:31:13,948
try and be somebody else?

331
00:31:15,694 --> 00:31:17,753
I always wanted to be a dancer...

332
00:31:19,464 --> 00:31:23,525
like in a troupe or something.

333
00:31:23,602 --> 00:31:27,504
You know, it probably
sounds kind of cheesy.

334
00:31:27,572 --> 00:31:29,665
<i>No. No.</i>

335
00:31:29,741 --> 00:31:31,936
So what about this club?

336
00:31:33,612 --> 00:31:36,308
Corey thinks we can work there.

337
00:31:36,381 --> 00:31:39,214
- Dancing?
- I guess.

338
00:31:45,490 --> 00:31:48,482
She givin' out a few freebies along the way?

339
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:52,621
What, is that supposed to be, like, some kind
of a judgment or something?

340
00:31:52,697 --> 00:31:55,689
- Wait. No, no. I just-
- Where's the bathroom?

341
00:31:55,767 --> 00:31:57,792
- I-I didn't-
- This place is giving me the creeps.

342
00:31:57,869 --> 00:32:00,736
I didn't mean it like that.

343
00:32:39,845 --> 00:32:41,836
<i>What are you waiting for?</i>

344
00:32:59,998 --> 00:33:01,932
Why me?

345
00:33:07,639 --> 00:33:09,630
I've done a lot of bad things.

346
00:33:10,675 --> 00:33:13,269
Do you want to do something else?

347
00:33:16,748 --> 00:33:19,945
I like it here, with you.

348
00:33:20,018 --> 00:33:21,918
Turn around.

349
00:33:21,987 --> 00:33:26,048
<i>The beginning of the end
starts here.</i>

350
00:33:29,628 --> 00:33:31,562
I don't wanna hurt anyone.

351
00:33:31,630 --> 00:33:34,428
<i>But they want to hurt you.</i>

352
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:55,853
What's happening?

353
00:33:56,855 --> 00:33:58,789
Everything.

354
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:03,084
Burn it to the ground.

355
00:34:44,069 --> 00:34:46,697
Hi. Are you planning
on checking out today?

356
00:34:46,771 --> 00:34:48,500
Uh-

357
00:34:48,573 --> 00:34:51,201
Well, you're already
two days behind, so-

358
00:34:51,276 --> 00:34:55,212
I gotta find my friend,
check on the car.

359
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:58,078
Maybe you should go for the weekly rate,
save yourself some money.

360
00:34:58,149 --> 00:35:00,640
Thanks. Yeah.

361
00:35:00,719 --> 00:35:02,983
I'm very jealous, you know.

362
00:35:03,054 --> 00:35:05,022
Road-trippin' cross-country.

363
00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:09,049
Seein' America like Sal and Dean,
Thelma and Louise-

364
00:35:09,127 --> 00:35:11,391
<i>Easy Rider style.</i>

365
00:35:11,463 --> 00:35:15,695
- You know, bandits on the run. Yeah.
- Okay. Well, I-I gotta go.

366
00:35:15,767 --> 00:35:19,999
Okeydokey.
Oh, that's good though.

367
00:35:20,071 --> 00:35:24,508
Hey, did you ever hear about that island
where Elvis Presley and Jimi Hendrix...

368
00:35:24,576 --> 00:35:27,739
and, you know, uh,
Janis Joplin, they're all-

369
00:35:27,812 --> 00:35:29,746
They're not dead, you know?
Jim Morrison.

370
00:35:29,814 --> 00:35:32,009
They're all just there playin' music.
Have you heard of that?

371
00:35:50,702 --> 00:35:54,570
Must have melted from the heat.

372
00:35:54,639 --> 00:35:57,437
This church was made of brick...

373
00:35:59,010 --> 00:36:02,309
these crosses made of iron.

374
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:04,940
You think a simple fire did this?

375
00:36:05,016 --> 00:36:07,246
What are you saying then, John?

376
00:36:07,318 --> 00:36:11,015
I'm saying there are forces
at work here.

377
00:36:11,089 --> 00:36:15,389
I feel it in my soul- something evil.

378
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:17,985
Here we go.

379
00:36:31,276 --> 00:36:33,301
Son of a bitch.

380
00:36:33,378 --> 00:36:35,778
This town will crucify him.

381
00:36:44,723 --> 00:36:47,157
<i>I just can't believe it. I just-</i>

382
00:36:47,225 --> 00:36:49,159
I can't believe it's real.

383
00:36:49,227 --> 00:36:53,596
It's gonna be all right, Trudy.
You're gonna get through this.

384
00:36:53,665 --> 00:36:56,600
- Um, excuse me.
- Yes?

385
00:36:56,668 --> 00:36:59,637
Is everything okay?

386
00:36:59,704 --> 00:37:02,639
No. No, actually, it's not.

387
00:37:04,476 --> 00:37:07,536
Mount Calvary burned
to the ground last night.

388
00:37:07,612 --> 00:37:10,775
The police are investigating, but-

389
00:37:10,849 --> 00:37:12,783
I already know it's arson.

390
00:37:12,851 --> 00:37:16,446
- How do you know?
- Call it a feeling.

391
00:37:18,456 --> 00:37:22,017
- I have a personal relationship with Jesus Christ.
- Amen.

392
00:37:22,093 --> 00:37:24,027
Really?

393
00:37:25,964 --> 00:37:27,898
Mmm, what's he like?

394
00:37:27,966 --> 00:37:31,561
He's, um-

395
00:37:33,338 --> 00:37:35,272
He's big and strong.

396
00:37:36,407 --> 00:37:40,104
Tan, lots of muscles.

397
00:37:41,546 --> 00:37:45,642
And he's got lightning bolts
shooting out of his eyes.

398
00:37:45,717 --> 00:37:50,017
- No, really.
- It's true. He's awesome.

399
00:37:51,322 --> 00:37:53,256
He chose me.

400
00:37:53,324 --> 00:37:56,657
Conejo Springs
used to be a decent place.

401
00:37:58,096 --> 00:38:01,998
Then came the drugs and... anus sex.

402
00:38:03,902 --> 00:38:07,030
But each of us is responsible...

403
00:38:07,105 --> 00:38:09,437
to make a little change,
however we can.

404
00:38:10,975 --> 00:38:14,911
We need to get to the children
before they spoil.

405
00:38:17,749 --> 00:38:20,013
Oh. My bracelet.

406
00:38:25,690 --> 00:38:27,817
It's from John.

407
00:38:27,892 --> 00:38:30,087
He knows I love Jesus the most.

408
00:38:33,598 --> 00:38:36,362
Oh, hey.

409
00:38:36,434 --> 00:38:39,301
Somebody burned down the-
Somebody burned down the church.

410
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:42,806
- I know.
- Yeah, it's pretty uncool, you know.

411
00:38:42,874 --> 00:38:45,274
Uh, Pastor John's a great guy.

412
00:38:45,343 --> 00:38:48,312
- Why?
- He went to prison.

413
00:38:48,379 --> 00:38:53,180
You know, he reinvented himself,
uh, started a new life.

414
00:38:53,251 --> 00:38:56,152
Helps kids with problems.

415
00:38:56,221 --> 00:38:58,519
I still- I still
never got your name.

416
00:38:59,724 --> 00:39:01,658
It's Sam.

417
00:39:01,726 --> 00:39:04,092
Jeremy. Jeremy Frame.

418
00:39:04,162 --> 00:39:06,722
Got it.

419
00:39:06,798 --> 00:39:10,928
- So, what are you up to?
- Um, trying to get money out.

420
00:39:11,002 --> 00:39:12,936
Kind of unsuccessfully.

421
00:39:13,004 --> 00:39:15,632
Oh, uh, still got that 20?

422
00:39:15,707 --> 00:39:17,902
I gave it to the motel.

423
00:39:17,976 --> 00:39:20,672
Well, you know, if you, um,
talk to Phil long enough...

424
00:39:20,745 --> 00:39:22,679
about U.F.O.'s,
he won't even charge you.

425
00:39:22,747 --> 00:39:24,715
Just don't say anything
about my meteorite.

426
00:39:24,782 --> 00:39:26,841
He's still pretty pissed
I got my hands on it first.

427
00:39:26,918 --> 00:39:30,513
Mmm. I- I think I'd rather pay.

428
00:39:30,588 --> 00:39:32,954
Are you leaving?

429
00:39:33,024 --> 00:39:35,219
- Thanks anyways.
- Oh. Yeah.

430
00:39:36,261 --> 00:39:38,320
Hi.

431
00:41:53,264 --> 00:41:57,462
- Hey. What happened to you last night?
- What happened to you?

432
00:41:57,535 --> 00:41:59,765
Passed out at Randy's.

433
00:42:01,305 --> 00:42:05,264
You should've stayed longer.
Want a beer?

434
00:42:05,343 --> 00:42:09,837
No. I want to get out of this place.
Did you find that water pump?

435
00:42:09,914 --> 00:42:13,008
Think so.
I haven't put it in yet.

436
00:42:13,084 --> 00:42:17,453
- Why not?
- Because we're having fun.

437
00:42:17,522 --> 00:42:20,116
Drinking warm beer
and dry-humping to Journey?

438
00:42:20,191 --> 00:42:22,091
Boo-yah.

439
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:24,594
- Do you have something better to do?
- I thought we both did.

440
00:42:24,662 --> 00:42:26,596
Well, it really doesn't matter
what you think.

441
00:42:28,833 --> 00:42:31,597
You know, maybe I do have
better things to do.

442
00:42:31,669 --> 00:42:34,331
<i>What, like try to
off yourself again?</i>

443
00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:42,502
You can sleepwalk back to Virginia
for all I care.

444
00:42:48,686 --> 00:42:50,677
- You going after her?
- What?

445
00:42:50,755 --> 00:42:54,191
- Pretty harsh words.
- Says the small-town drunk.

446
00:42:54,258 --> 00:42:57,284
- Get out.
- Get the fuck out!

447
00:43:02,567 --> 00:43:05,058
Sam!

448
00:44:03,027 --> 00:44:06,326
<i>Well, you're a lucky girl-
got out of that car when you did.</i>

449
00:44:08,366 --> 00:44:10,926
<i>Could've been two dead today
instead of just one.</i>

450
00:44:14,138 --> 00:44:17,005
Now...

451
00:44:17,074 --> 00:44:19,907
you and I both know
that Randy had been drinkin'.

452
00:44:21,979 --> 00:44:24,777
But we also know
that he's not at fault here.

453
00:44:24,849 --> 00:44:26,817
How do you explain the car
that came out of nowhere?

454
00:44:26,884 --> 00:44:30,411
How do you explain midgets or sock monkeys?
I don't know.

455
00:44:31,656 --> 00:44:33,590
Shit happens.

by a prince named Justin...</i>

470
00:45:47,632 --> 00:45:53,537
<i>and the prince was led into a world
of strange and beautiful magic.</i>

471
00:45:53,604 --> 00:45:57,005
<i>Nobody could see
how beautiful she was...</i>

472
00:45:57,074 --> 00:45:59,565
<i>because she was invisible-</i>

473
00:45:59,644 --> 00:46:02,374
<i>invisible to everyone except Justin.</i>

474
00:46:22,270 --> 00:46:25,068
<i>Wake up.</i>

475
00:46:30,512 --> 00:46:32,776
<i>Come closer.</i>

476
00:46:41,356 --> 00:46:43,347
<i>Closer.</i>

477
00:46:57,706 --> 00:47:01,039
- Why can't I touch you?
- 'Cause we'll explode.

478
00:47:01,109 --> 00:47:05,102
<i>You shouldn't be here.
Nobody should.</i>

479
00:47:05,180 --> 00:47:08,240
I just want Sam back.

480
00:47:11,052 --> 00:47:16,115
Sam is dead.
But you can find her.

481
00:47:26,201 --> 00:47:28,260
It's already begun.

482
00:47:28,336 --> 00:47:30,998
You don't have much time.

483
00:48:26,094 --> 00:48:28,790
I thought you'd be gone.

484
00:48:28,863 --> 00:48:31,491
Where?

485
00:48:36,404 --> 00:48:38,338
Anywhere.

486
00:48:42,677 --> 00:48:44,838
You, uh-You want a smoke?

487
00:49:01,329 --> 00:49:03,923
I am so fuckin' sorry.

488
00:49:05,266 --> 00:49:07,200
I know.

489
00:49:07,268 --> 00:49:10,362
I heard you signed the police report.

490
00:49:10,438 --> 00:49:14,704
Said I wasn't drinking. Why?

491
00:49:14,776 --> 00:49:17,870
Ruining your life won't bring Sam back,
would it?

492
00:49:17,946 --> 00:49:20,779
Make things right.

493
00:49:22,417 --> 00:49:24,351
You believe in spooky shit?

494
00:49:24,419 --> 00:49:27,411
- What, like Satan?
- Like ghosts.

495
00:49:27,489 --> 00:49:32,290
<i>I don't not believe in them,
but I've never seen one.</i>

496
00:49:34,029 --> 00:49:36,896
I said some pretty mean things
to Sam before she died.

497
00:49:40,101 --> 00:49:42,569
Think we're bad people?

498
00:49:43,671 --> 00:49:45,764
Not bad.

499
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:47,774
I'd say medium.

500
00:49:52,881 --> 00:49:56,282
I'm sorry.

501
00:50:07,162 --> 00:50:10,791
I think I'm supposed
to find Billy Moorcroft.

502
00:50:10,865 --> 00:50:13,060
Find him where?

503
00:50:13,134 --> 00:50:16,467
I don't know, but I saw him.

504
00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:22,032
At the car accident.
At the motel.

505
00:50:22,110 --> 00:50:27,013
And it's like-
All I can think is it's just guilt.

506
00:50:27,082 --> 00:50:29,710
What did he say?

507
00:50:29,784 --> 00:50:33,242
I don't remember.
It's like I was trippin' or something.

508
00:50:33,321 --> 00:50:38,224
I got this acid one time-
this Flying Eagle Pyramid shit.

509
00:50:40,228 --> 00:50:42,719
I took two hits, and-

510
00:50:42,797 --> 00:50:46,733
There was this glowing grid
cutting through my brain, and-

511
00:50:46,801 --> 00:50:49,998
You know, I knew when it
got all the way through...

512
00:50:50,071 --> 00:50:52,266
that I'd just be, like,
this sketched-out vegetable.

513
00:50:54,976 --> 00:50:59,470
The whole time, my esophagus was
twisting and turning in my throat.

514
00:51:02,150 --> 00:51:04,880
I can slip back into it
now and again.

515
00:51:04,953 --> 00:51:07,945
But that's, like, a gift
and a curse.

516
00:51:08,022 --> 00:51:11,856
'Cause that means you gotta
figure out what's real and what's not.

517
00:51:13,161 --> 00:51:15,152
It's, like, you have to decide.

518
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:22,734
Maybe this is all a nightmare
and we'll just wake up.

519
00:51:27,275 --> 00:51:29,869
I'd do anything
to take it all back...

520
00:51:29,944 --> 00:51:31,969
just start over.

521
00:51:32,046 --> 00:51:34,844
That's about as real as it gets.

522
00:51:34,916 --> 00:51:37,111
<i>There's gotta be some connection...</i>

523
00:51:37,185 --> 00:51:39,710
between what happened
to Sam and Donnie.

524
00:51:43,725 --> 00:51:45,659
That was Sam's brother?

525
00:51:46,828 --> 00:51:48,762
<i>She didn't mention him to me.</i>

526
00:51:48,830 --> 00:51:50,764
<i>Why would she?</i>

527
00:51:50,832 --> 00:51:55,326
I told her about me, about my brother.
I thought that she-

528
00:51:55,403 --> 00:51:58,167
She never talked
to anybody about it.

529
00:51:58,239 --> 00:52:00,400
What about her parents?

530
00:52:00,475 --> 00:52:03,569
<i>They treated her like she wasn't enough
for them to love.</i>

531
00:52:04,946 --> 00:52:08,074
<i>She told me she thought
her brother was the lucky one.</i>

532
00:52:09,484 --> 00:52:13,511
<i>Everyone would remember him
and love him forever.</i>

533
00:52:13,588 --> 00:52:16,182
Like he had the easy way out.

534
00:52:16,257 --> 00:52:18,987
You believe in second chances?

535
00:52:20,528 --> 00:52:23,258
I believe in "life sucks
and then you die. "

536
00:52:37,312 --> 00:52:39,303
It's time.

537
00:52:45,954 --> 00:52:48,218
Bring your water.

538
00:53:09,210 --> 00:53:11,508
<i>Do you miss Sam?</i>

539
00:53:11,579 --> 00:53:13,513
Where is she?

540
00:53:13,581 --> 00:53:15,515
Do you miss her?

541
00:53:15,583 --> 00:53:17,778
Yes.

542
00:53:21,923 --> 00:53:23,891
Here it comes.

543
00:53:28,229 --> 00:53:31,062
<i>What would you do to get her back?</i>

544
00:53:32,567 --> 00:53:34,558
Anything.

545
00:53:59,761 --> 00:54:01,820
<i>You're almost there.</i>

546
00:54:01,896 --> 00:54:04,091
Inside?

547
00:54:10,138 --> 00:54:12,003
You have to go.

548
00:54:24,118 --> 00:54:27,144
<i>They won't let you do
whatever you want.</i>

549
00:54:31,859 --> 00:54:34,555
This is your last chance.

550
00:54:34,629 --> 00:54:36,654
Are you coming with me?

551
00:54:36,731 --> 00:54:39,029
That's impossible.

552
00:55:32,620 --> 00:55:35,589
I'd do anything to take it all back.

553
00:55:47,001 --> 00:55:48,935
<i>Just start over.</i>

554
00:56:19,834 --> 00:56:21,768
Hey.

555
00:56:21,836 --> 00:56:24,498
Hey. What happened to you?

556
00:56:24,572 --> 00:56:28,599
<i>You should've stayed longer.
Want a beer?</i>

557
00:56:28,676 --> 00:56:32,669
No. I want to get out of this place.
Did you find that water pump?

558
00:56:32,747 --> 00:56:35,477
Think so.
I haven't put it in yet.

559
00:56:37,919 --> 00:56:39,853
The motel guy came to the room
this morning.

560
00:56:39,921 --> 00:56:42,321
- I don't give a damn.
- Dude, we can't afford another day.

561
00:56:42,390 --> 00:56:45,655
I can't do this.

562
00:56:45,726 --> 00:56:47,887
What's wrong?

563
00:56:47,962 --> 00:56:50,226
I lied to you.

564
00:56:51,732 --> 00:56:54,292
My dad doesn't...
know we're here.

565
00:56:54,368 --> 00:56:57,064
He doesn't- He doesn't even
really know that I exist.

566
00:56:59,207 --> 00:57:01,141
So, what-what now?

567
00:57:02,410 --> 00:57:06,039
I don't know.
Maybe we get matching mullets...

568
00:57:06,113 --> 00:57:08,377
couple of tramp stamps.

569
00:57:08,449 --> 00:57:10,849
Put Randy in stud.

570
00:57:10,918 --> 00:57:14,684
Park here for a lifetime or so.

571
00:57:16,057 --> 00:57:19,049
Or...

572
00:57:19,126 --> 00:57:22,755
you can go and do something
totally fucking amazing.

573
00:57:22,830 --> 00:57:25,025
What about you?

574
00:57:28,636 --> 00:57:31,605
I got my own plans.

575
00:57:39,647 --> 00:57:42,013
We're so perfect.

576
00:57:43,251 --> 00:57:46,015
Immaculate.

577
00:58:42,043 --> 00:58:47,276
<i># I've never seen you
when you're smiling #</i>

578
00:58:48,382 --> 00:58:54,218
<i># It really gets
under my skin #</i>

579
00:58:54,288 --> 00:59:00,420
<i># You say it's easy
when it's faster#</i>

580
00:59:00,494 --> 00:59:04,988
<i># I still can't guess
what you're after#</i>

581
00:59:05,066 --> 00:59:09,366
<i># It's the color of your skin #</i>

582
00:59:10,871 --> 00:59:16,138
<i># Your skin is black metallic #</i>

583
00:59:18,012 --> 00:59:22,949
<i># It's the color of your skin #</i>

584
00:59:24,452 --> 00:59:28,912
<i># Your skin is black metallic #</i>

585
00:59:31,158 --> 00:59:35,424
<i># Your skin is black metallic #</i>

586
00:59:37,465 --> 00:59:42,300
<i># Your skin is black metallic ##</i>

587
00:59:51,245 --> 00:59:53,179
Why did you show me this?

588
00:59:53,247 --> 00:59:55,807
<i>Do you want to know
what happens when you die?</i>

589
00:59:59,387 --> 01:00:01,719
Yes.

590
01:00:01,789 --> 01:00:06,658
You will. I died for you.
Will you do the same?

591
01:00:06,727 --> 01:00:09,525
Donnie liked to draw.

592
01:00:10,731 --> 01:00:12,665
It hurts.

593
01:00:12,733 --> 01:00:15,395
Remember the future.

594
01:00:16,604 --> 01:00:18,572
<i>You need to get to higher ground.</i>

595
01:01:15,023 --> 01:01:18,720
- You like it? We just got that in.
- You work here?

596
01:01:18,793 --> 01:01:20,727
My parents' store.

597
01:01:22,530 --> 01:01:26,296
<i>Hey. I-I'm really sorry about Corey.</i>

598
01:01:27,902 --> 01:01:30,427
I understand that you don't want
to talk about it, but I believe...

599
01:01:30,505 --> 01:01:32,439
that everything happens
for a reason...

600
01:01:32,507 --> 01:01:35,169
and-and I know
that for every action...

601
01:01:35,243 --> 01:01:38,872
- there is an equal and opposite reaction.
- I went to high school.

602
01:01:38,947 --> 01:01:41,472
Then you know that everything
is in constant motion.

603
01:01:41,549 --> 01:01:43,517
Like, right now,
the universe is expanding.

604
01:01:43,585 --> 01:01:45,951
And we're flying through space...

605
01:01:46,021 --> 01:01:49,980
at millions of miles per hour,
like a spaceship.

606
01:01:50,058 --> 01:01:53,755
And eventually it's just gonna grow so big
that it'll freeze and die...

607
01:01:53,828 --> 01:01:56,922
and then nothing we do
will matter at all.

608
01:01:56,998 --> 01:01:59,660
So Corey doesn't matter?

609
01:01:59,734 --> 01:02:03,830
No. She matters.
It's just-

610
01:02:03,905 --> 01:02:08,171
I believe everyone has something
that they're meant to do.

611
01:02:08,243 --> 01:02:11,269
Potential, or-or-or destiny.

612
01:02:11,346 --> 01:02:16,374
Like, I was destined to get my hands
on that meteorite.

613
01:02:16,451 --> 01:02:20,046
And it turns out that-that it's not even
a meteorite at all.

614
01:02:20,121 --> 01:02:24,956
It has this-this metal in it that doesn't
even exist on the periodic table.

615
01:02:25,026 --> 01:02:28,223
I think- I think
I'm gonna call it Framium.

616
01:02:28,296 --> 01:02:30,856
Like your last name?

617
01:02:30,932 --> 01:02:34,197
Everything's changing for me.

618
01:02:34,269 --> 01:02:38,501
I can see things that I only
used to dream about.

619
01:02:38,573 --> 01:02:41,235
What happened to your arm?

620
01:02:41,309 --> 01:02:45,268
It's, uh- It's just a rash.

621
01:02:50,185 --> 01:02:51,413
Sam.

622
01:02:54,889 --> 01:02:57,653
Is there anything I can do?

623
01:02:57,725 --> 01:02:59,955
Bring back my friend.

624
01:03:00,028 --> 01:03:01,996
Buy me that dress.

625
01:03:02,063 --> 01:03:05,055
I can't afford that.

626
01:03:05,133 --> 01:03:08,330
You can't bring back
my friend either, can you?

627
01:03:09,904 --> 01:03:11,394
No.

628
01:03:11,473 --> 01:03:15,239
Well, then what good are you?

629
01:03:21,149 --> 01:03:23,083
Sam, please.

630
01:03:23,151 --> 01:03:26,416
Hey. Get lost.

631
01:03:26,488 --> 01:03:28,456
You fucking kiddin' me?

632
01:04:19,674 --> 01:04:21,471
<i>Hey.</i>

633
01:04:21,543 --> 01:04:24,512
Surprised to see you here.

634
01:04:24,579 --> 01:04:28,811
I was just, um, returning your book.

635
01:04:28,883 --> 01:04:32,046
Oh. Do you wanna talk?

636
01:04:33,221 --> 01:04:35,155
About?

637
01:04:35,223 --> 01:04:38,659
How if I told you that God
could show you the way...

638
01:04:38,726 --> 01:04:41,957
- make sense of things?
- I don't think so.

639
01:04:42,030 --> 01:04:45,966
You know, he can find you too-
help jump-start your future.

640
01:04:47,235 --> 01:04:50,568
<i>I'd like to show you something.
What do you say?</i>

641
01:05:07,422 --> 01:05:09,356
Come on.

642
01:05:25,573 --> 01:05:28,701
Sometimes I like to just
come in here and sit...

643
01:05:28,776 --> 01:05:31,711
and just stare up at that screen...

644
01:05:31,779 --> 01:05:35,715
<i>and wait for God to show me
his plan for my life.</i>

645
01:05:39,087 --> 01:05:44,855
So, uh, you do a lot of drugs
when you were younger?

646
01:05:44,926 --> 01:05:47,895
Go ahead.

647
01:05:47,962 --> 01:05:49,827
You try it.

648
01:05:49,897 --> 01:05:54,732
Look up there on that screen
and try to visualize...

649
01:05:54,802 --> 01:05:58,238
what you think God's plan
for your life is.

650
01:05:58,306 --> 01:06:01,798
- You go first.
- Okay.

651
01:06:01,876 --> 01:06:05,243
<i>- What do you see?</i>

652
01:06:06,347 --> 01:06:09,145
<i>I see a light.</i>

653
01:06:11,386 --> 01:06:14,480
<i>A divine, guiding light.</i>

654
01:06:20,762 --> 01:06:24,755
So, what do you see for me?

655
01:06:26,100 --> 01:06:28,034
Well, you have to look for yourself.

656
01:06:28,102 --> 01:06:31,037
<i>Go ahead. Picture-</i>

657
01:06:31,105 --> 01:06:35,872
<i>Picture what you think
God wants your life to be like.</i>

658
01:06:45,653 --> 01:06:48,053
So, what did you see?

659
01:06:49,357 --> 01:06:51,291
My childhood.

660
01:06:51,359 --> 01:06:54,817
- Oh, you can't go back.
- I thought it was my turn.

661
01:06:54,896 --> 01:07:00,801
Well, if you want to be born again,
you have to forget the past.

662
01:07:04,872 --> 01:07:07,136
Jeremy told me you were in prison.

663
01:07:09,410 --> 01:07:11,605
What did you do?

664
01:07:11,679 --> 01:07:15,376
Uh-

665
01:07:19,053 --> 01:07:22,045
That's not very...
important.

666
01:07:23,424 --> 01:07:28,361
Is that why you found God?
To save yourself?

667
01:07:29,697 --> 01:07:31,961
He found me.

668
01:07:35,002 --> 01:07:37,766
Do you know that...

669
01:07:37,839 --> 01:07:40,740
everything in the universe-

670
01:07:40,808 --> 01:07:43,299
everything- is God's will?

671
01:07:46,414 --> 01:07:50,009
- What about black holes?
- Everything.

672
01:07:50,084 --> 01:07:52,052
Dinosaurs?

673
01:07:52,120 --> 01:07:54,054
- Everything.
- Herpes?

674
01:07:56,691 --> 01:08:00,684
You know, it's no coincidence that
you're here with me. You know that?

675
01:08:02,697 --> 01:08:05,530
<i>I have something for you.</i>

676
01:08:07,602 --> 01:08:09,797
A little bracelet.

677
01:08:09,871 --> 01:08:13,170
"W.W.J.D."

678
01:08:13,241 --> 01:08:15,835
<i>"What would Jesus do?"</i>

679
01:08:15,910 --> 01:08:18,504
<i>Here. Let me put it on your wrist.</i>

680
01:08:18,579 --> 01:08:21,309
It's okay.

681
01:08:21,382 --> 01:08:25,318
Just a friendly little reminder.

682
01:08:30,558 --> 01:08:33,994
You don't know how special
you are, do you?

683
01:08:34,061 --> 01:08:37,827
See, I thought
you were gonna trust me.

684
01:08:39,634 --> 01:08:42,831
No. I changed my mind.

685
01:08:42,904 --> 01:08:46,738
Do you know that God
can change his mind too?

686
01:08:49,444 --> 01:08:52,174
Sam- Sam, listen to me.

687
01:08:52,246 --> 01:08:54,339
Where were you?

688
01:08:54,415 --> 01:08:57,179
We were supposed to raise money
for the church today. That was our plan.

689
01:08:57,251 --> 01:08:59,310
We-We were just talking.

690
01:08:59,387 --> 01:09:03,050
- Right, Sam? We were just talking.
- Yeah. Just-Just talking. Here.

691
01:09:04,525 --> 01:09:07,016
Good thing
sinners can repent, right?

692
01:09:10,465 --> 01:09:13,127
Trudy, nothing happened.

693
01:09:13,201 --> 01:09:15,692
I believe you.

694
01:09:15,770 --> 01:09:18,432
She made you do it.

695
01:09:18,506 --> 01:09:20,906
<i>I didn't do anything.</i>

696
01:09:20,975 --> 01:09:22,909
John, my bracelet's missing.

697
01:09:22,977 --> 01:09:25,309
Let's go.

698
01:10:07,321 --> 01:10:09,312
"When the manipulated awaken...

699
01:10:09,390 --> 01:10:12,484
"on their journey
to the tangent universe...

700
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:17,827
"they are often haunted
by the experience in their dreams.

701
01:10:17,899 --> 01:10:20,732
Many of them will not remember. "

702
01:10:28,042 --> 01:10:31,068
Death comes to us all.

703
01:10:42,890 --> 01:10:44,551
<i>Here we come.</i>

704
01:10:46,193 --> 01:10:48,127
<i>Time to die.</i>

705
01:11:40,781 --> 01:11:42,715
Give it back to me.

706
01:11:47,154 --> 01:11:49,213
Why are you looking at me funny?

707
01:11:50,358 --> 01:11:52,292
Why are you looking funny?

708
01:11:55,363 --> 01:11:57,297
What happened to you?

709
01:11:59,934 --> 01:12:02,698
Grandma told me you would come.

710
01:12:02,770 --> 01:12:05,204
I don't know your grandma.

711
01:12:13,714 --> 01:12:15,909
What's your name?

712
01:12:15,983 --> 01:12:18,474
Justin Sparrow.

713
01:12:18,552 --> 01:12:20,884
Roberta Sparrow?

714
01:12:22,189 --> 01:12:24,817
Show me how to do it.

715
01:12:24,892 --> 01:12:27,122
I understand now.

716
01:12:27,194 --> 01:12:29,424
Sh-Show you what?

717
01:12:30,665 --> 01:12:33,657
You know, they found
your dog tags in the church.

718
01:12:33,734 --> 01:12:35,668
They said you burned it down.

719
01:12:40,441 --> 01:12:42,739
We had to get to higher ground.

720
01:12:44,679 --> 01:12:46,613
Look here.

721
01:12:54,155 --> 01:12:55,679
Wh-What's that?

722
01:12:55,756 --> 01:12:58,247
Your dream face.

723
01:12:58,325 --> 01:13:00,520
Just like you showed me.

724
01:13:00,594 --> 01:13:02,653
Donnie liked to draw.

725
01:13:02,730 --> 01:13:05,665
- How'd you know his name?
- You told me.

726
01:13:05,733 --> 01:13:07,462
When?

727
01:13:08,536 --> 01:13:10,299
When you were dead.

728
01:13:10,371 --> 01:13:13,204
I remember the future.

729
01:14:10,631 --> 01:14:12,963
Trudy?

730
01:14:15,069 --> 01:14:16,559
Hello?

731
01:15:59,672 --> 01:16:02,971
Burger, fries, Pepsi-
no tomato on the burger.

732
01:16:03,042 --> 01:16:05,033
- Please.
- Good goin', kiddo.

733
01:16:05,111 --> 01:16:07,841
And don't you worry.
They'll find him. They always do.

734
01:16:09,015 --> 01:16:11,882
- Who?
- Iraq Jack.

735
01:16:17,423 --> 01:16:20,392
You still mad at me?

736
01:16:21,461 --> 01:16:22,894
No.

737
01:16:22,962 --> 01:16:25,522
It wasn't my fault.

738
01:16:25,598 --> 01:16:27,828
The car came out of nowhere.

739
01:16:27,900 --> 01:16:29,834
I know.

740
01:16:41,614 --> 01:16:43,548
You saw my brother's bones?

741
01:16:46,119 --> 01:16:50,749
If you went up to that mine
a day earlier...

742
01:16:50,823 --> 01:16:53,724
might have found
Billy Moorcroft still alive.

743
01:16:56,562 --> 01:16:59,224
They say he probably suffered.

744
01:17:00,333 --> 01:17:02,494
I'm sorry.

745
01:17:02,568 --> 01:17:07,005
He just left him there...
to die.

746
01:17:07,073 --> 01:17:09,007
Cold and alone.

747
01:17:09,075 --> 01:17:12,044
They think Iraq Jack did it?

748
01:17:12,111 --> 01:17:14,579
- Yes, he did.
- Why?

749
01:17:14,647 --> 01:17:18,549
Found his stuff.
Right up above the mine.

750
01:17:18,618 --> 01:17:20,916
He didn't do it.

751
01:17:20,987 --> 01:17:24,013
Doesn't matter anymore.

752
01:17:24,090 --> 01:17:28,891
My brother, Corey, Billy-

753
01:17:28,961 --> 01:17:30,895
they're dead.

754
01:17:30,963 --> 01:17:32,897
That's it.

755
01:17:32,965 --> 01:17:35,957
I didn't tell you something before.

756
01:17:37,837 --> 01:17:40,328
My brother died too.

757
01:17:41,908 --> 01:17:44,274
I was 10.

758
01:17:44,344 --> 01:17:48,804
Ever since that day,
nothing's ever been the same.

759
01:17:48,881 --> 01:17:52,044
Never will be.

760
01:17:52,118 --> 01:17:54,712
We can't change that.

761
01:17:54,787 --> 01:17:57,085
Think it'll ever get easier?

762
01:17:57,156 --> 01:17:59,249
Probably get worse.

763
01:18:01,194 --> 01:18:03,856
- Maybe it's up to us.
- How?

764
01:18:05,031 --> 01:18:08,091
Wake up, start over.

765
01:18:09,369 --> 01:18:11,803
I wish I could believe that.

766
01:18:13,706 --> 01:18:17,073
We have the same holes
in our hearts...

767
01:18:17,143 --> 01:18:19,111
you and me.

768
01:18:34,193 --> 01:18:36,787
Show me how.

769
01:18:36,863 --> 01:18:38,922
Please show me how.

770
01:18:38,998 --> 01:18:41,125
- I'll show you how.
- No!

771
01:18:41,200 --> 01:18:45,694
Three hours, 41 minutes
and 35 seconds.

772
01:18:45,772 --> 01:18:48,332
That's when the world will end.

773
01:19:02,522 --> 01:19:06,390
I'm sorry. I failed.

774
01:19:06,459 --> 01:19:10,156
But he didn't do it.
I told you everything.

775
01:19:10,229 --> 01:19:12,163
I spoke with Trudy myself.

776
01:19:12,231 --> 01:19:14,426
She's lying. It's hers.

777
01:19:16,536 --> 01:19:19,300
How dare you accuse me!

778
01:19:19,372 --> 01:19:22,239
This is my bracelet.

779
01:20:26,672 --> 01:20:28,697
What do you think?

780
01:20:32,612 --> 01:20:37,845
I think it's the nicest thing
anyone's ever done for me.

781
01:20:42,522 --> 01:20:44,513
That can't be true.

782
01:20:47,126 --> 01:20:49,117
It is.

783
01:20:54,534 --> 01:20:57,901
<i>Well, uh, that's just the beginning.</i>

784
01:20:59,872 --> 01:21:02,841
I want you to come watch
the fireworks with me tonight.

785
01:21:05,211 --> 01:21:08,305
- I don't know.
- Oh, come on.

786
01:21:08,381 --> 01:21:11,475
It's gonna be beautiful.

787
01:21:11,551 --> 01:21:13,883
You don't want to miss it.

788
01:21:15,555 --> 01:21:19,252
I- I really don't know
if I'm up for it.

789
01:21:19,325 --> 01:21:22,852
You shouldn't be alone.
I mean, just-

790
01:21:22,929 --> 01:21:27,366
Go ahead. Try it on.
Huh?

791
01:21:54,393 --> 01:21:56,327
Why are we up here?

792
01:21:56,395 --> 01:21:58,329
This is the best spot.

793
01:21:59,599 --> 01:22:02,363
<i>I don't wanna be up here.</i>

794
01:22:02,435 --> 01:22:05,427
You look beautiful.
Come on.

795
01:22:08,574 --> 01:22:10,565
This is right where
the fireworks will come up.

796
01:22:15,281 --> 01:22:18,045
It'll be awesome.
You'll see.

797
01:22:22,955 --> 01:22:25,515
Just forget about everything.
You know, for one second.

798
01:22:26,525 --> 01:22:28,720
<i>Clear your mind.</i>

799
01:23:44,670 --> 01:23:46,661
Fucking duds!

800
01:23:52,912 --> 01:23:55,176
Did you see that?

801
01:23:55,247 --> 01:23:58,114
- What?
- This-

802
01:24:00,553 --> 01:24:04,319
<i>This is- This is impossible!</i>

803
01:24:04,390 --> 01:24:06,858
<i>- What? The fireworks?
- No.</i>

804
01:24:06,926 --> 01:24:10,293
The tesseracts.

805
01:24:16,335 --> 01:24:18,963
<i>What happened to you?</i>

806
01:24:19,038 --> 01:24:21,598
<i>That rash is gnarly.</i>

807
01:24:21,674 --> 01:24:25,838
Well- Is that all
you can think about?

808
01:24:25,911 --> 01:24:27,936
Look at the sky.

809
01:24:35,354 --> 01:24:37,515
They're coming.

810
01:24:37,590 --> 01:24:41,048
And there's only one person in the world
I wanna watch this with.

811
01:24:42,895 --> 01:24:46,160
Just one kiss. I really need this.

812
01:24:46,232 --> 01:24:49,463
Are you really that superficial?

813
01:24:49,535 --> 01:24:52,026
Or maybe-

814
01:24:52,104 --> 01:24:56,734
Maybe you're just a cock tease and you've
been stringing me along this whole time.

815
01:24:56,809 --> 01:25:00,267
Jeremy, you're creeping me out.

816
01:25:00,346 --> 01:25:03,679
- Maybe you could just calm down and-
- Calm down?

817
01:25:03,749 --> 01:25:06,377
Here's me being calm!

818
01:25:12,391 --> 01:25:14,689
Holy shit.

819
01:25:17,897 --> 01:25:21,833
If you could see...
what I see-

820
01:25:28,808 --> 01:25:30,901
<i>Sam?</i>

821
01:26:24,697 --> 01:26:27,962
Only you can save the universe.

822
01:26:41,714 --> 01:26:43,648
Sam?

823
01:26:44,650 --> 01:26:46,584
Sam!

824
01:28:49,908 --> 01:28:52,274

01:29:17,669 --> 01:29:22,436

832

833
01:30:02,047 --> 01:30:07,610
<i># And kiss the sky #</i>

834

<i>You all right, Frank?</i>

841
01:30:52,464 --> 01:30:54,398
I don't believe this.

842
01:30:54,466 --> 01:30:58,562
<i>Sell this thing off to some
meteorological nerd club...</i>

843
01:30:58,637 --> 01:31:00,571
<i>you might just do okay.</i>

844
01:31:00,639 --> 01:31:02,732
What kind of a man
do you think I am...

845
01:31:02,807 --> 01:31:05,503
to try to make a buck
off another man's death?

846
01:31:07,245 --> 01:31:09,179
You oughta be ashamed of yourself...

847
01:31:09,247 --> 01:31:11,181
for even suggesting such a thing.

848

851
01:31:46,217 --> 01:31:49,277
So, how often does that bus come?

852
01:31:50,522 --> 01:31:51,784
Why?

853
01:31:53,191 --> 01:31:55,489
<i>- I'm leaving.
- What?</i>

854
01:31:59,297 --> 01:32:02,528

856
01:32:13,878 --> 01:32:16,506

01:32:17,716 --> 01:32:19,308
Immaculate.

858
01:32:20,719 --> 01:32:23,187
You gonna be all right?

859
01:32:35,900 --> 01:32:37,834
Get out of here.

860
01:32:40,338 --> 01:32:42,272
Where you gonna go?

861
01:32:42,340 --> 01:32:45,867
- Virginia.
- What's that like?

862
01:32:46,945 --> 01:32:49,038
