1
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,073
Catch a falling star
and put it in your pocket

2
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,833
Never let it fade away!

3
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:53,550
Catch a falling star
and put it in your pocket

4
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,473
You know
how some movies have
a dream sequence,

5
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:59,438
only they don't
tell you it's a dream?

6
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,353
This is so not a dream.

7
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,318
It wasn't
supposed to be like this.

8
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:11,237
I was just
trying to do my job,
and then things happened.

9
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,197
My life happened.

10
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,311
And now I'm here.

11
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,628
Trust me,
I'm not the kind of girl
who does things like this.

12
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,710
Two months ago,
you couldn't have picked me
out of a crowd.

13
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:27,869
Hi. Call me.

14
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,555
Told you. I'm over there.

15
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,992
I was the youngest copy editor
at the Chicago Sun-Times.

16
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,149
Josie.
Hello.

17
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,434
"Theater"?

18
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,272
Standard American
calls for E-R.

19
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,875
Standard British, R-E.
So, unless you're

20
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,513
a pompous American,
I would go with E-R.

21
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,195
I had my own office,
unlimited stationery supplies

22
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,236
and a dedicated assistant.

23
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,197
How about this
awesome new phrase,

24
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:59,113
"Power is powerful."
Total T -shirt, right?

25
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,155
Amazing. what?

26
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,229
Can I get my messages?

27
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,389
Yeah.

28
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:05,517
Hey, seriously,
last time I saw you,
did I look fat?

29
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,194
OK, you hesitated.
No, it's case-closed.

30
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,716
Excuse me, Merkin,
there aren't any index cards,

31
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,472
so I can't do my notes...

32
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,633
Hey, hey,
hey, Merkin ain't jerkin'.
He's workin'. OK?

33
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,393
Take that to the bank.
It's power, baby.

34
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,676
Yeah, my boss.

35
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,197
I'm just a little tense.
This office is not feng shui.

36
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:31,317
All the desks are facing,
like, evil, you know?

37
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,153
Do you think
I should bleach my teeth?

38
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,639
Some sunshine
around the mouth?

39
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:39,759
Or maybe I should
just laser my gums.

40
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,590
Josie! Guess who I
did it with last night.

41
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,159
Roger from Op-Ed?

42
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,832
Ah! who told you?

43
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,797
You said yesterday,

44
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:54,270
"I have a date with
Roger from Op-Ed tonight,

45
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,311
"and I'm gonna do it
with him."

46
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,153
Septuplet story.
I need it by five.

47
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,349
Hopefully,
the copy's not a mess.

48
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:04,672
"It's hoped that
it's not a mess."
"Hopefully" means "with hope".

49
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,591
You have it
defining the copy, and I'm

50
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,035
pretty sure the copy
doesn't have feelings.

51
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,348
Hm.

52
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,269
So, Anita,
you and Roger in Op-Ed.

53
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,349
Oh, man, who told you?

54
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,873
Roger.
Really?

55
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,554
Don't make me
send you another memo

56
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,517
about my policy on
interoffice dating.

57
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,670
It's intra-office dating.

58
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:25,638
And they're not dating.
They're having sex.

59
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,399
Oh.

60
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,914
And what exactly is
your policy, Augustus?

61
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,515
That if you're
not getting any,
then no one can? Hm.

62
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,679
How many times
have I fired her?
Five or six.

63
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,111
Eight.

64
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,232
Gus,
did you get those story ideas
that I left on your desk?

65
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:48,437
Morning, Mr. Strauss.
The blind foster-home mother.

66
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,670
That was good.
I got Cahoon on it.

67
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,716
Oh, yeah, Cahoon. He's good.

68
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:56,679
Geller,
we've been through this.
You're a great copy editor.

69
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,274
Maybe my best copy editor.
You're not a reporter.

70
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,955
You've used five of my ideas.
Gus, please.

71
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,235
Everyone thinks he can write,

72
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:08,835
but a journalist
gets in there, where the
bombs are falling.

73
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,077
He's aggressive.
He grabs
the bull by the balls.

74
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,276
You don't think I can
grab a bull's balls?

75
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:18,478
You don't want
a reporter's life.
Trust me. They're very messy.

76
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,393
And you're all
about order and control

77
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,755
and getting me
my copy by five.

78
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,673
I can be out of control.

79
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,315
Copy by five!

80
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,473
Josie, maybe Gus has a point.

81
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,791
It's not gonna kill you
to relax and have some fun.

82
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:49,111
Hey, Roger's got this friend,
Marshall, in editing.

83
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,668
Maybe we could all
go on a double date.

84
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,956
Marshall, "the Duke"?

85
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,792
I swear to God,
Josie, come on.

86
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,872
Tell me, when is the last time
you went on a real date?

87
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,230
I'm concentrating
on my career now.

88
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,750
Do you own any
colored underwear?
Stripes or anything?

89
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,792
The right guy's out there.
I'm just not gonna

90
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:12,997
go kiss a whole bunch
of losers to get to him.

91
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:16,789
Yeah, but sometimes
kissing the losers
can be a really fun diversion.

92
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,399
Mm-hm!

93
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:21,995
when I finally get kissed,
I'll know.

94
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,629
If you've never kissed a guy,
we have bigger problems
than underwear.

95
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,751
I've kissed a guy.

96
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:34,148
I've kissed guys.
I just haven't
felt that thing.

97
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,676
"That thing"?
Is that what you kids
are calling it these days?

98
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:42,755
That thing. That moment
when you kiss someone

99
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:46,833
and everything
around you becomes hazy.

100
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:50,310
And the only thing in focus
is you and this person.

101
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,675
And you realize that
that person is the only person

102
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:59,070
that you're supposed to kiss
for the rest of your life.

103
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:04,636
And for one moment
you get this amazing gift.

104
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:08,116
And you wanna laugh
and you wanna cry...

105
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,353
cos you feel so
lucky that you found it

106
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:17,116
and so scared
that it'll go away,
all at the same time.

107
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,713
Damn, girl. You are a writer.

108
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,914
OK, I'm finished.

109
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:46,438
what do you guys think?
where do you
think it should go?

110
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,829
In the bedroom?
That's exactly
what I was thinking.

111
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,669
Perfect.

112
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,112
The meeting just began.
Let me start by saying

113
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:19,954
I was very impressed with
that investigative piece

114
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:23,555
that Dutton did on pesticides
in our supermarkets.

115
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,148
But since
the Trib did a piece on

116
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,676
the same subject,
only better, you're fired.

117
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,359
Huh?

118
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,829
Dutton, did you hear me?
You're fired. Out.

119
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,992
Close your cubicle.
Bye-bye, Dutton.

120
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:40,038
Hello, everybody
else still working here.

121
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:45,911
Let's celebrate by doing
another undercover feature!

122
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,879
Now,
you know that my inspiration
for these stories comes,

123
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,310
of course,
from my personal life.

124
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:57,190
I mean, who would
have thought that my foray
into the hair plugs

125
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:00,119
would have resulted in
last month's cover story?

126
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:04,796
"Hair Today, Gone Tomorrow."
A great story.

127
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:08,276
Last night I'm sitting home
with my family,
having dinner...

128
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,032
Roger.

129
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,395
..and my younger
boy starts to choke!

130
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:16,712
Then I realized my son
was allergic to peanuts.

131
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,711
I said to myself,

132
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:23,078
"Holy shit! I don't
even know my own kids."

133
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,991
"How much do we
know about these

134
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,469
"high-school kids?
what are they thinking?"

135
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,274
And then it hit me.

136
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,998
Boom!

137
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:36,636
"My Semester in High School."

138
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:39,280
You. what's your name?

139
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,639
J... J... Josie.

140
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,995
José?
Josie Geller.

141
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:48,239
Josie Geller,
you enroll Friday! Have fun!

142
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,788
The meeting just ended.

143
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,269
Josie. Josie!

144
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,670
..20-minute handstand.
Freaked the yogi right out.

145
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,751
Excuse me.

146
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,675
Josie...

147
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:06,594
Uh... It's really happening!

148
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:10,389
"My first undercover feature,
by Josie Geller"!

149
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,914
Josie, maybe you
should turn it down.

150
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,911
why?
You don't think I can do it?

151
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,152
No! It's just,
this is a lot of pressure
for your first piece.

152
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,231
This is not
a half-a-page article.

153
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,993
This is a major
undercover piece.

154
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,356
Look what Rigfort
just did to Dutton,
and he's his cousin.

155
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,477
Don't worry. I'm gonna
straighten this all out.

156
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,357
You guys don't
think I can do this?

157
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,192
we're not saying that.

158
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,999
when you wanted to seduce
the mailroom guy,

159
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,911
and you thought
you couldn't learn Spanish,

160
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,991
who quizzed you
on your verbs?

161
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,948
Señorita Josie.

162
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,395
Gus, when you wanted
to learn how to knit,

163
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,750
who showed you how
to work the needles?

164
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,512
You did.
You knit?

165
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,472
Yeah.

166
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,719
So this is my chance.

167
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,833
I'm not holding your
job for you, Geller.

168
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,035
Thank you!

169
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,189
OK...

170
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:09,510
Don't make me give you
my memo on
interoffice hugging.

171
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,716
Now comes the hard part.

172
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:15,674
Oh, my gosh.
You get to be 1 7 again.

173
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:19,076
wow.
OK, what's the first thing
you're gonna need?

174
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,956
You want Bambi? No way.

175
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,713
Rob, please.

176
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,199
why don't you just
borrow Mom's car?

177
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,949
I can't use a minivan.
I need a cheap car.

178
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:34,477
A vintage classic.
It's just for
a couple of months.

179
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,075
A couple of months is like
ten years in Bambi life.

180
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,720
It's so weird that
you name your cars.

181
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,791
why? Guys name their penises.

182
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,391
OK...

183
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:52,749
You can have
my Buick LeSabre and name it
anything you want.

184
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,836
Really?

185
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,239
LeSabre.

186
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,878
Nah, I don't think so.

187
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,758
Fully loaded.
Maybe.

188
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,955
wow, are those
shorts or a skirt?

189
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,191
They're gaucho pants.
I got them on sale.

190
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:11,636
Aloha. welcome!
Every customer
gets a free lei.

191
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,150
Relax, Monty.
It's just my sister.
Aloha, my ass.

192
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,832
Shake it easy, buddy.

193
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,388
Have you talked to
the admissions lady

194
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,436
from Lakeshore
Community College yet?

195
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,875
No.

196
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:26,520
But you could start
before next semester,

197
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,750
talk to her about
a baseball scholarship.

198
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:31,195
It's too late,
Josie, you know?

199
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:35,512
I'm not going to college.
I'm not playing
baseball anymore.

200
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,636
This is my life.

201
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:42,836
This is a luau that
sells packing material.

202
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,838
You had such a shot
at playing college ball.

203
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,713
You let one case
of mono stop you.

204
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:55,349
Don't you want to move
out of Mom and Dad's?
Pay your own bills?

205
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,034
why?
So I can be as happy as you?

206
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:03,633
I am happy.
Besides, you are looking at

207
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:08,111
the newest
undercover reporter
for the Chicago Sun-Times.

208
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:12,432
I am Josie Geller,
high-school student,
senior class 1 999.

209
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,313
Uh-uh.

210
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,835
You're kidding, right?
what?

211
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,759
Josie, do you
remember high school?

212
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,034
It was a long time ago.

213
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:26,391
Do you remember what
they called you
in high school?

214
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:31,759
..Grossie! Josie Grossie!
Josie Grossie! Josie...

215
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,914
Josie Grossie.

216
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,434
I know. I made it up.

217
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:44,752
I didn't know it was gonna
catch on like it did.

218
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:47,832
Oh, Josie, what's the matter?
You look nauseous.

219
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,639
Nauseated. I look nauseated.

220
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:38,157
Hi, Billy. I noticed
that you weren't in
math class today,

221
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,915
so, um, I decided to take
some notes for you.

222
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,835
This is a very bad idea.

223
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:08,552
It's only in your dreams

224
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,752
But it felt like it was real

225
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,111
You're only

226
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,675
You're only seventeen

227
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,550
You're only

228
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:31,030
You're only seventeen

229
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,997
You're only

230
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:37,111
You're only seventeen

231
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:07,274
Hey, feeling good.

232
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:15,392
"My name is Josie. I'm from
Scranton, Pennsylvania,
the Keystone State."

233
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,755
Hold it.
where are you going?

234
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:20,798
To high school, because
I'm a high-school student.

235
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:24,998
I'm here with my
fellow students.
Hey, guys. Hi.

236
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:35,677
Beeper, appears legitimate.
Computer organizer.
Recording device.

237
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,398
I can
grab bulls' balls.

238
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,277
Appears legitimate.

239
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,476
This is
a projectile launcher.

240
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,151
That's a weapon.

241
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,118
Class, today we have
the pleasure of exploring

242
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:08,153
the pantheistic culture
of India. India...

243
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,028
Hi, hello.
willkommen! Entrez, entrez.

244
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,071
I'm sorry I'm late.

245
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:21,630
well, I'm sorry
I forgot to take my
hot flash medication today.

246
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:27,589
Please sit. Josie, right.
Mi casa es su casa.

247
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,637
That is so sad.

248
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:33,315
I know. Five chickens
had to die just so she
could look stupid.

249
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:37,349
Josie, in my classroom,
tardiness is unacceptable.

250
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,953
I'm sorry.

251
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,395
Not as sorry as I am.

252
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,989
Olé!

253
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,594
Ten minutes in that,
you'll never be late again.

254
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:51,069
So let's hear
something about you.

255
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,310
Stand up. Stand up.

256
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,639
My name is Josie Geller.

257
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,757
I'm a high-school student.
I'm from...

258
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,712
Billy?

259
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:16,513
Excuse me?
You live in "Billy"?

260
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:19,194
B-Bali. Uh, Billy-Bali.

261
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,551
Um, it's a suburb
of Bali proper.

262
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,315
Bali?
The island nation of Bali.

263
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:29,477
Fascinating. what did
your family do there?

264
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:34,479
Um, we were sheep...
Sheep farmers.

265
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,275
My family raised sheep.

266
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,878
Note to self: research Bali.

267
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:52,472
Kill Anita for
picking out this outfit.
Find and destroy sombrero.

268
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,590
we sit here.
Yeah.

269
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,274
I'm sorry. I didn't
know they were assigned.

270
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,351
They're not.

271
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,472
Morning, everyone.

272
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,596
Morning.

273
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,672
I don't think we've met.

274
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,271
I'm Sam... Coulson.

275
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:21,352
The school has a thing about
letting you guys call me Sam.

276
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,591
I'm Josie. But I'm
pretty sure the school

277
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,557
would be OK with
you calling me that.

278
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,995
welcome to Shakespeare's
As You Like It.

279
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:31,071
As You Like It...
we can share.

280
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,434
..is an example of
Shakespearean...

281
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:35,114
Thank you.

282
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:40,797
..pastoral comedy.
Now, does anyone know
what that means?

283
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,950
Yeah, that's what
they do to milk.

284
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:47,272
No, Sera,
that's "pasteurize".
But it's close.

285
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,476
Parakeet?

286
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,551
OK, anyone else?

287
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,359
Josie.

288
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,793
"Pastoral" means
set in the country,

289
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:00,678
originally seen in
the Eclogues of Virgil.

290
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:03,513
It's from
the Latin "pascere",
"to graze".

291
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,471
Are you sure you're 17?

292
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:15,791
Yes. I'm 17.

293
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:18,395
I'm 17. Of course.

294
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:33,037
Excuse me.
what's in the coleslaw?

295
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,517
Thank you.

296
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,753
Leave.

297
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:47,310
Kirsten,
that bran muffin has,
like, 75 grams of fat.

298
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,674
Nah-uh.

299
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:51,069
Did I tell you that
Lisa has hemorrhoids?

300
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,991
Shot right up.
Hi.

301
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,513
Hi, Kristen.

302
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,919
It's Kirsten.

303
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,477
Oh. OK.

304
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,119
Oh!

305
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:09,994
well, that'll teach me
to wear white jeans
after Labor Day.

306
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,475
I don't think you're supposed
to wear white
jeans after 1983.

307
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,798
Right. Right, right.

308
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:25,080
OK, so, like, what are
you guys' hopes and dreams?

309
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,555
Any interests?

310
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,676
Hi. I'm Guy.

311
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:36,630
Hi. Yes, you are a guy.
Quite a guy.

312
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:41,476
Oh, my. That rhymes.

313
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:46,273
Yikes. Bikes!

314
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,516
Are you in special ed?

315
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,236
I mean, are you?

316
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,878
I can't believe
he just said that.

317
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,712
He just said that.

318
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,791
I'm just gonna go.

319
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,835
Don't slip, honey.

320
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:05,989
Off the chart.

321
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,112
How old am I?

322
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,512
Oh, approximately
6,350 days old.

323
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:17,309
Now, that's subject
for adjustment for
month of birth.

324
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,109
OK, OK, thank you.

325
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,678
Hustle, hustle!
Come on, girls!

326
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,796
Geller, move it!
Pick up your feet!

327
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:33,031
Come on! A little
more commitment, Geller!

328
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,873
Move it! Come on!
what is...

329
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,629
Must have water.
what do I look like?
A waitress?

330
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:42,917
Now complete these sprints.
If you don't, you fail.

331
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,709
And if you fail gym,
you're never
getting into college.

332
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,473
You guys are still
telling that lie?

333
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:52,677
That does it, Geller.
Drop, give me 20.
No...

334
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:58,032
Don't worry, Rob.
I put premium gasoline
in her.

335
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:01,556
Josie, I told you Bambi's
a cheap, regular girl.

336
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,472
wait a second.
what?

337
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:08,155
I'll call you later.
Josie... Don't hang up!

338
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,510
They do it to
all the new kids.

339
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,232
who's "they"?

340
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,834
Guy Perkins and
his amazing lemmings.

341
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,433
They push your car
out of its space,

342
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:20,114
hide it and watch
while you look for it.

343
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:23,317
I'm Aldys.
I'm Josie.

344
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,071
Aldys.
That's an interesting name.

345
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,760
when it's not yours.
My mom was going

346
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:33,673
through her
Harlequin Romance phase.

347
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,557
Tell me about it.

348
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:38,200
Try being named after
a guitar-playing pussycat.

349
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,952
Never mind.

350
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:45,828
would you like
to walk to Na-Na's
and get something to eat?

351
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:52,396
Yeah.
That would be really nice.

352
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:57,717
So, tell me, what are your
hopes and your dreams?
what do you wanna be?

353
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,199
Thank you.
Thank you.

354
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:03,671
I wanna be a professor
of medieval literature.
I wanna be a novelist.

355
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,911
I wanna be
a weekend flutist,
a potter, a painter.

356
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,790
I wanna be an architect
and I wanna go
to Northwestern.

357
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,108
I went there!

358
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,349
For what?

359
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:17,910
Um... Yes, once.
To use the bathroom.

360
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:20,793
Um... They had
a really nice facility.

361
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,628
Oh, my God.

362
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:36,949
Hello?

363
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:40,713
what the hell kind of story
are you pitching?

364
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:44,678
It's my dad. He worries.
Yeah, mine too.

365
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,796
Hi, Dad. I miss you, too.

366
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,791
You are one
sick puppy, Geller.

367
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:52,589
It's an exposé on
cafeteria food.
Let me guess.

368
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,750
"The Terrible
Truth About Coleslaw."

369
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:57,274
The bulk of it will be
about the pimento loaf.

370
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,271
Geller,
you wanna be a reporter?

371
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:02,432
Take a look at what sells:
sex scandals,

372
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:05,273
bribery,
people jumping off buildings.

373
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,874
So unless a kid
killed himself cos
he was being paid

374
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,473
to have sex with
the school mascot

375
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:12,120
in a vat of coleslaw,
you got nothing.

376
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,032
Call me when you do.

377
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:23,238
They love to
disconnect the battery, too.

378
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,434
Here.
Thanks.

379
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:34,470
Just so that you know,
I think they recalled
these cars in 1 974.

380
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,551
Yeah, thanks.

381
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:40,189
Sure, no problem. Josie?
Yeah?

382
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:43,875
I was wondering,
how are you at calculus?

383
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,353
I'm good.

384
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,510
would you like to
join the Denominators?

385
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,836
we have these fun
pizza study groups

386
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,876
and go to these
all-county meets.

387
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,157
And I don't wanna sound
like the Godfather,

388
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,232
but we could offer
you a certain amount
of protection,

389
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:01,151
if you know what I mean.

390
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,917
That sounds great.

391
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,510
3x10 is 30

392
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,716
3x9 is 27

393
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,950
3x8 is 24

394
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:15,076
3x7 is 21

395
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,191
3x6 is 18

396
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,396
3x5 is 1 5

397
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,198
3x4 is 12

398
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,872
And 3x3 is 9

399
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,309
And 3x2 is 6

400
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:28,358
And 3x1 is 3 of course

401
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,829
Now dig the pattern
once more!

402
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:33,559
3, 6, 9,

403
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:54,997
"All the world's a stage,
And all the men and
women merely players."

404
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:57,913
Does anyone know what
Shakespeare meant by that?

405
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,712
Anyone?

406
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:04,076
It's about disguise,
about playing a part.

407
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,310
And that's the theme of
As You Like It.

408
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,834
Now, does anyone know
where we can see this?

409
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:11,833
Rosalind disguises
herself as a man,

410
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,399
and then escapes
into the forest.

411
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:18,031
Right. when she's in costume,
she can finally express
her love for Orlando.

412
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:22,910
Shakespeare's point is that
when we're in disguise,
we feel freer.

413
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,231
we do things we wouldn't do
in ordinary life.

414
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:31,235
Brett, what happens when
you go out on the football
field in uniform?

415
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,713
we kick ass!

416
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:36,759
You yell, you hit people.
You touch other guys' butts.

417
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,996
It's OK,
cos you're in uniform.

418
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,350
See, disguise
changes all the rules.

419
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:46,916
Tell you a story.
My first season
of peewee hockey...

420
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:52,035
well,
honestly, I was terrible.
I couldn't skate.

421
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,917
I was afraid to take a hit.

422
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,638
And my dad one day
bought me this

423
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:59,395
brand-new helmet,
signed by Gordie Howe.

424
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:04,349
Come on, guys. Gordie Howe!

425
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:09,635
OK, he was like
the Tiger woods of hockey.

426
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,035
Oh. All right.

427
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:15,032
Every time I put
on this helmet,
I feel invincible.

428
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,951
Suddenly, I skate harder.

429
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,473
I check people
left and right.

430
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:22,314
I even got thrown out of
a game once for fighting.

431
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:26,473
The point here is that
disguise can be liberating,

432
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:30,439
can get you
to do things that you
never thought possible.

433
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:32,795
And for Rosalind,
her male costume

434
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:36,276
opens the possibilities for
the great love of her life.

435
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:42,078
Josie, why don't you read
act five, scene two,
Rosalind's speech?

436
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:53,636
"No sooner they met,
but they looked.

437
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:56,996
"No sooner they looked,
but they loved.

438
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:59,150
"No sooner loved,
but they sighed.

439
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:02,829
"Does he notice me?

440
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:05,673
"Does he hear my heart
screaming his name?

441
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:11,752
"Sometimes it's so loud
I think that the gods
can hear my pain.

442
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:15,273
"His voice
is so mellifluous.

443
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:19,393
"If I could get
just one kiss."

444
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:30,840
what have you
wanted for, like, ever,

445
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:33,639
but never,
ever thought would happen?

446
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:36,280
I'm the most
popular girl in school

447
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,550
and Billy Prince is
asking me to the prom.

448
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:42,519
Yes.
what?

449
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:46,719
Billy Prince is
asking you to the prom.

450
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,870
why?

451
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,951
I don't know.

452
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:57,354
The poem.
I knew he'd like the poem!

453
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,670
Billy Prince is
asking me to the prom?

454
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,392
That's what I'm saying.

455
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:11,232
Oh, my God! I'm...
I'm actually speechless!

456
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:14,471
I have no words!
That's never happened to me!

457
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,516
words are my life!

458
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:23,269
Just a reminder,
your papers are due
next week.

459
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:29,797
This is Sydney,
student body president.

460
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:32,758
No going to the library.
There's an asbestos problem.

461
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,637
Can I get into my locker?

462
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:38,315
Now the prom.
Voting on the prom theme
is complete,

463
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:42,518
and the theme is...
"the Millennium"!

464
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,158
The prom is
going to be rufus.
what's "rufus"?

465
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:53,789
It's my new, cool,
hip word. Spread it
around like wildfire.

466
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,757
Rufus!

467
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:59,638
what is it with
this school and prom?

468
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:02,678
South Glen South competes
every year for best prom.

469
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:07,231
The theme is everything,
so whatever we pick

470
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,309
has to be totally unique.

471
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:14,233
There's a land that I see

472
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:17,478
where the children are free

473
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:20,878
Come with me, take my hand

474
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,713
And we'll live

475
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:27,037
In a land where
the river runs free

476
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:30,078
In a land to a shining sea

477
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:35,195
And we'll be free
to be you and me

478
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,669
what's that?

479
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,751
The old drive-in.
The Court.

480
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:41,752
It's just a continuous
party for Guy's group.

481
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,599
Hey.

482
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:47,510
Alpo, the dog park
is that way.

483
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,113
Go.

484
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,878
Last I checked,
this was a free country.

485
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:54,350
You're not seriously trying
to hang out at the Court.

486
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:58,228
Cheap wine coolers
and a fire in a trash can.
where do I sign up?

487
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:01,676
why don't you go home,
fickle around
on your calculator,

488
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:02,954
whatever you do,

489
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,519
and figure out
how many lifetimes

490
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,955
it's gonna take
you to get cool, OK?

491
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:16,236
Have you ever wanted
to go to the Court?

492
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:20,076
Are you kidding, Josie?
It's lame.

493
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:24,199
All they do is stand around
and get drunk. It's lame.

494
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:26,794
Yeah, it seems lame.

495
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:30,318
Yeah. It's very lame.

496
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,118
You said that.

497
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:39,709
The Court?
Josie, I am appalled.

498
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:43,679
Geez, I know. I mean, who'd
have known that these kids...

499
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:50,316
No! I am appalled because
I have a reporter in
there undercover,

500
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:53,710
for three weeks,
and I had to read
about this in the Trib.

501
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,791
You're right.

502
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,711
No, fold...

503
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:04,271
"17-year-old
Kristin Davis says

504
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:10,430
"'Yeah, everyone who's anyone
is at the Court on
Saturday night.'"

505
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:15,150
She's right. I have learned
that it is a popular place
for the kids to go.

506
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,993
This is where
the stories are.

507
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,710
You will become
friends with these people.

508
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:30,798
You will party with them.
You'll rave with them.

509
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,359
You'll get jiggy with them.

510
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:36,268
when they go to the prom,
you'll be in
the same damn limo!

511
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:38,351
Gus, listen.

512
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,952
The popular kids and I...

513
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,555
Do you even know these kids?

514
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,119
They hid my car.

515
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:52,109
Get to know them, very well!

516
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:56,153
Your job, and my job,
depends on it!

517
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,310
Um, by the way,
it's "depend" because
there's no S.

518
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:03,233
Your subject is plural.
Out!

519
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:11,914
Come on! Asses and elbows!
The news doesn't sleep,
you know!

520
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,834
A high hopper to
third base, but...

521
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:19,833
Yeah, baby! Mm! whoo!

522
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:25,040
Rob! You're making a mess.
Can you do this
at Mom and Dad's?

523
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:28,749
No, it's their turn
to do the Franklin Mint
potluck dinner.

524
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,717
But I made a pizza.

525
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,791
I can't do it.

526
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,876
what?

527
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:39,191
Damn! These are
high-school girls?

528
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:42,431
we got some underage hotties
on our hands here.

529
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:46,036
Gus wants me to be friends
with them, the popular kids.

530
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:48,395
It's impossible.
why?

531
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:51,517
You know what it was like
for me in high school.

532
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:55,229
All I wanted was
to be accepted.

533
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:02,239
And they just tortured me.
I can't go back to
South Glen South.

534
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:06,235
You're at South Glen South?
They have a killer
baseball team.

535
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,518
Focus, please.

536
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,591
OK, OK.

537
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:17,430
You're an adult now, Josie.
You're successful.

538
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:21,559
You graduated at
the top of your class.
You work for a newspaper.

539
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:25,838
You wash your hair now.
You're not Josie Grossie
anymore.

540
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:30,232
Don't you know how much
I just wanted to be you
in high school?

541
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:34,916
Just for one day
to know what it was
like to be popular.

542
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,389
It's not that hard, Josie.

543
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:40,790
All you need is
the right person,

544
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:43,110
one person to think
you're cool, and you're in.

545
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,316
Everyone will be too
scared to question it.

546
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,753
Is that true?

547
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:50,196
Yeah,
it's a little-known fact.

548
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:56,073
Don't you want to show 'em?
Gus, Billy Prince, yourself.

549
00:34:56,160 --> 00:35:00,199
Don't you want to show 'em
the cool kids don't
freak you out anymore?

550
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:04,398
That you can go in there
and be friends with them
and get your story?

551
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,710
Yes, desperately.

552
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,553
Plus, if you quit now,
you're no better than me.

553
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:10,789
Better than I.

554
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,558
That's the spirit.

555
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:15,791
So let's hear it.
"I'm not Josie Grossie
anymore."

556
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:18,269
I'm not Josie Grossie
anymore.

557
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,910
That's it. Now scream it.

558
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,878
I'm not Josie Grossie
anymore!

559
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,871
That's good.

560
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:45,959
Josie the Pussycat.

561
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:48,514
George?
what are you doing here?

562
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:52,395
Ah. Get in the van.
Go, go.

563
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,391
welcome to the love shack.

564
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,273
All right.

565
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,952
George, what's going on?

566
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:08,031
A little surveillance.

567
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:12,918
what are you doing?
Hidden camera.

568
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:13,989
wings?

569
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,399
Yeah.

570
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:19,553
That's great, but I
really should talk to Gus
about this first.

571
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:23,519
Geller, stop being
a pain in the ass.

572
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:24,555
Gus?

573
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:28,872
No, it's
the great and powerful Oz.
You're in way over your head.

574
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:33,317
Here's how it's gonna work.
I review the tapes,
I find your story.

575
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:37,951
All right.
Battery, transmitter.
Plug it in.

576
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,354
Man.

577
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,271
There we go.
Good luck to you.

578
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:44,794
I don't believe
this. George?
Hm?

579
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:47,792
How are you so cool?

580
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:53,512
It's hard work.
Herbs, berries.
I'll be watching you.

581
00:36:56,920 --> 00:37:00,879
All right, let's get
this party started. Yeah.

582
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:06,395
Come on, picture, come on.
There. Oh...

583
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:09,836
There. Ooh,
they didn't look that good
when I went to high school.

584
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:13,677
Kirsten, Kristin, Gibby!
what's up, girlfriends?

585
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,958
Ooh.

586
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:19,234
I'm OK.

587
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,833
That's gonna leave a mark.

588
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,117
"And so it is
Rosalind in disguise

589
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:29,115
"who is best
able to see through
the disguises of others.

590
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:32,431
"To say to Phoebe 'Mistress,
know thyself.'

591
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,676
"To look at love
from every angle.

592
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:39,590
"And to realize, finally,
that she is in
love with Orlando.

593
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:44,515
"To free both hearts,
not in judgment
but in equality. "

594
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,909
That's really well written.

595
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,275
Showtime's over.

596
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:52,238
Come on, move it.
Back to work.

597
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:56,314
Gus, have you ever
been in love?

598
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,879
Leave.

599
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,279
Oh, give it up, Gus.

600
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:03,193
Come on. I'm just
making conversation.

601
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,031
Love...

602
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:12,717
who knows what that is?
Deadlines, circulation...
That I understand.

603
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:18,108
You know, you should go out
every now and then.

604
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:22,518
If you put on
a couple of new ties,
girls would be all over you.

605
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:26,791
Anita?
what?

606
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,155
Leave me alone.

607
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:31,800
I've got enough
work here to
last me all night.

608
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,917
I don't have
anything to do tonight,

609
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:39,715
so if you would
like some help,
I would love to help you.

610
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,310
No Roger from Op-Ed?

611
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,391
Nope.

612
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:04,556
Excuse me, do you guys think
that we could work out
some kind of schedule,

613
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,676
and I could work around it?

614
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:09,593
Hey. where's your sweatshirt?

615
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,194
Oh, I must have
forgotten it.

616
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:14,510
I have an extra
in my locker.
I'll go get it.

617
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:17,797
So, I'll see you tonight,
7.30, Na-Na's, right?

618
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:19,996
OK, right, 7.30.
Yeah.

619
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:22,275
I'm late for lab.

620
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,839
Ozomatli? Oh, yes.

621
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,878
This band is so good.
Have you heard
this band play?

622
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,518
I'll get my mom's car
and I'll drive.

623
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,670
This is gonna
be rufalicious!

624
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:35,709
No, Jason,
it's not a stick of gum.
It's "rufus". "Rufus."

625
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,519
You drinking tonight?

626
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:10,874
Uh, no.

627
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:15,272
I'm not 21. I'm 1 7, and I
still attend high school.

628
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:20,999
Two of you?

629
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:42,348
Josie! Josie.
Hi.

630
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:45,193
Out on a school night?

631
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,555
The bathroom was disgusting.

632
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:49,596
I'd like you to meet Lara.

633
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,432
His girlfriend.

634
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:54,876
She's visiting from New York.
Josie's one of my students.

635
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,632
How are you?
what?

636
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,870
Hi, there!

637
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:01,918
I'm sorry.
I can't even think in here.

638
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,956
No offence.
I know you love this.

639
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:08,272
I just hope you get it
all out of your system
before you move to New York.

640
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:12,234
My firm has season tickets
to the Met.

641
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:14,754
Oh, well, I love baseball!

642
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:21,195
Nice to meet you.

643
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,709
Nice to meet you, too.

644
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:39,039
we are tomorrow.
Hello, I'm tomorrow.

645
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:43,875
Cos when we get the money
and the power,
the women come to me.

646
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:47,748
Do what I'm doin'. You know,
if you ain't movin',
no movement.

647
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,193
write that down.

648
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:52,917
welcome to my
little humble abode,
you know?

649
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,878
Let me just
handle my business.

650
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:58,554
wait a minute.
Got something funky.

651
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:17,237
That was great, you guys.
That was great.

652
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:29,072
Excuse me? Can I sit there?

653
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:32,789
Yeah. we accept all people.
we are all about the love.

654
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,393
Come on and have a seat.

655
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:35,879
Thank you so much.

656
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:39,875
How are you?
Very well. How are you?

657
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:42,679
I'm feeling good.
I feel real good.

658
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:46,116
we have a special cake
for you.

659
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:48,395
Have some cake.

660
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:53,713
It's a special cake,
a ganja cake.
It has vitamin A, vitamin B,

661
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:56,912
vitamin T, H and C.
It's good for you.
Eat it up.

662
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,956
what?

663
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:03,392
Is that...? No, girl,
put it back. Just say no.

664
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:04,789
Mm!

665
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,428
Good, huh?

666
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:09,154
That is delicious.
You know,
I love chocolate.

667
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:13,116
She gonna get
tore off the floor!

668
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:20,191
Firecracker.
He was a firecracker!

669
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:24,318
Firecracker.

670
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:28,031
Man, I don't love her.

671
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:31,917
whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

672
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:05,719
I know this woman.

673
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:07,392
She's my superior.

674
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:19,514
what is that?

675
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:23,192
Let me hear you say "yeah"!

676
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:45,239
I'm telling you,
Rob, I think
I really did it.

677
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:48,273
I think I'm totally in!
I was so cool!

678
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:52,070
You know what's
a weird word?
"Fork."

679
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:55,076
Oh! Did I tell you about
the new friends I made?

680
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:57,754
I made friends with
a whole table of Rastafari.

681
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:00,110
Not just one.
A whole table!

682
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:04,878
Oh, my God.
Someone ate my entire pie.

683
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:07,871
I don't know
how that happened.

684
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:37,109
Hi, Guy!

685
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:38,918
Guys, Guy's guys!

686
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,319
Hey, loser.

687
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:42,351
Oh, my God.
Loser!

688
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:54,515
what is going on up here?

689
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:56,989
Everybody goin' nuts?

690
00:45:58,840 --> 00:45:59,989
Loser!

691
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:04,989
Loser.

692
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:30,111
All right,
all right,
look up, girl.

693
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:31,519
Jo-Jo, look up.

694
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:34,630
"Loser." See?
"Loser." Look!

695
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:36,269
Hello?

696
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:38,229
Yes!

697
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:44,595
Oh, my God!

698
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,037
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

699
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:51,874
whoa, calm down.
Just wash it off.
we're all cool.

700
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:56,395
what are you doin'?

701
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:00,390
I see you had
wheaties for breakfast.

702
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:06,750
Bleuch. It's like
the All-Humiliation Network.

703
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:27,518
when you call my name
It's like a little prayer

704
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:31,832
I'm down on my knees
I wanna take you there

705
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:33,791
In the midnight hour...

706
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:39,199
Hello?

707
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:40,395
Oh, hi, Billy.

708
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,116
OK, I'll be out
in a jiffer.

709
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:46,555
Have fun.

710
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:48,119
OK, thanks.
Bye-bye!

711
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:57,789
Hi, Billy!

712
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:07,790
write a poem
about this, geek!

713
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:23,515
Josie?
Is that you, honey?

714
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:49,196
Josie, get up.

715
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:51,311
Josie, are you OK?

716
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:53,669
Josie.

717
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:55,715
Are you crazy?

718
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:57,029
what are you doing here?

719
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:59,516
I just registered.
Check it out.

720
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:02,670
Manufactured
at the Tiki Post.

721
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,274
Can you do that?

722
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:05,429
I just did.

723
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:09,432
Jose, this is it.

724
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:11,279
This is my ninth inning.

725
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:14,352
The game isn't over.
I just thought it was.

726
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:17,113
See, if I get
on the South Glen
baseball team,

727
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:18,952
the right scout sees me,

728
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:21,713
I'm in the minors.
It's game time!

729
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:23,358
But you're 23 years old.

730
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:26,153
Yeah, with the reading
comprehension
of a 1 5-year-old.

731
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:28,633
Plus, I'm popular.

732
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:30,472
You wanna be popular.

733
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:32,437
I recognize a cry for
help when I see one.

734
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:34,113
Hear one.

735
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:35,514
whatever.

736
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:37,592
That is so like you.

737
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:40,274
You know,
you can't just
come in here

738
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:42,555
and be popular
in just one day.

739
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:45,713
Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob!

740
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:10,275
I'm the coleslaw
king of the world!

741
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:13,117
Dude, you rock, man.

742
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:17,439
He is so hot.

743
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:20,999
Hi.
Hey.

744
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:24,078
I'm Tracy. I'm 1 6.

745
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:25,513
I'm a gymnast.

746
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:27,272
I don't have a boyfriend.

747
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:28,469
Cool.

748
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:31,349
Josie?

749
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:34,474
where were you last night?
I was really worried.

750
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:35,629
what?

751
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:37,876
You know,
last night at 7.30?

752
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,436
Na-Na's? I kept calling you,
but I just got your machine.

753
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:44,592
I don't even know
your parents' line.
I was really worried.

754
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:47,630
I'm sorry.
I must have forgot.

755
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:52,236
Maybe you should forget
about sitting with us, too.

756
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:59,348
Let's make some
money for the prom!

757
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:02,551
Mr. Coulson! Oh!

758
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:22,272
watch your step.

759
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:24,753
where's your partner?

760
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:26,831
I don't have one.

761
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:29,718
Lonely ride
in bucket five!

762
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:30,915
Single!

763
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,991
Do you have
to yell it like that?

764
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:34,354
Sure, I do.

765
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:37,031
Thank you.
watch your step.

766
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:38,989
Is this seat taken?

767
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:42,679
Thank you.

768
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:47,318
Thank you.
You're welcome.

769
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,035
whoa!

770
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:53,714
whoa.

771
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:55,279
Are you scared?

772
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:57,510
Uh, well,
I'll tell you
something here.

773
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:02,274
I hope this doesn't
undermine my position as
an authority figure, but...

774
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:05,510
I'm a little
afraid of heights.

775
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:08,349
You're afraid of
the Ferris wheel?

776
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:11,792
Actually,
it's the plunging
headfirst

777
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:14,115
into the crowd part
that kind of gets me.

778
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:18,034
I bet if you had
your Gordie Howe helmet
on you'd feel better.

779
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:20,313
Hey, you remember
that story?

780
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:22,231
I remember
everything you say...

781
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:24,991
in your classroom.

782
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:29,109
If the bucket's a-rocking,
don't come a-kn-kn-knocking!

783
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:31,875
Yeah! Yeah!

784
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:34,152
Boys.
I know.

785
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:36,595
Mr. Coulson
rocks my world!

786
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:41,393
I'd like to tell you that
we all grow out of it.

787
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:42,469
It's a lie.

788
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:44,710
Some of us will
always be rattling cages.

789
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:47,072
why do you do that?

790
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:50,959
I don't know.

791
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:54,589
what's scary is that
when you get older,
it gets more confusing.

792
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:58,230
I mean, you know Lara,
my girlfriend you
met at the club?

793
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:00,199
we've been going out
for five years,

794
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:03,039
and now she wants me
to move to New York.

795
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:06,275
And, you know,
I mean, I should do it.

796
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:08,675
You know,
make the commitment
and grow up.

797
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:11,271
I know we have
our differences.

798
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:16,752
I shouldn't be talking about
this stuff with you.
I'm sorry.

799
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:20,634
It's nice to have
someone to talk to.

800
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:24,758
Yeah, same here.

801
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:29,868
when you're my age,

802
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:32,952
guys will be
lined up around
the block for you.

803
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:38,393
You have to say that
cos you're my teacher.

804
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:44,110
Actually, I shouldn't
say that because
I'm your teacher.

805
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:46,315
Oh.

806
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:52,077
Josie Geller? No way.

807
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:53,429
Yeah.

808
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:55,192
She dated
the drummer from
the Big Bad Voodoo Daddys?

809
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:57,716
I've always wanted to
be a drummer. Always.

810
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:00,874
And then she dumped him
for the drummer...

811
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:04,477
All right, that's it.

812
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:07,516
Just water
and Ex-Lax till prom.

813
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:09,755
It's all about hydration.

814
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:13,078
Did you guys
know that Josie's dad
invented Ex-Lax?

815
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:15,995
She's, like, the heiress
to the Ex-Lax fortune.

816
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:17,115
Shut up.

817
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:19,039
No, it's true.

818
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,389
She spends all of
her extra time
with her family

819
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:24,675
on a yacht in
the South of France.

820
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:25,829
wow.

821
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:38,031
Quick hands,
quick hands.
Here we go.

822
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:39,269
who's a winner?

823
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:42,591
Focus. Good work, good work.
Easy, easy. Good work.

824
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:45,037
Thanks for showing
me that new grip.

825
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:46,999
It totally
changed my swing, man.

826
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:48,229
No problem.

827
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:49,514
Hey, what's goin' on?

828
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:51,676
You guys know
Josie Geller?

829
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:52,875
I know her.
You mean Loser?

830
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:55,312
Nah, man,
she's cool.

831
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:57,277
I used to go
out with her, man.

832
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:58,429
what?

833
00:54:58,520 --> 00:55:00,112
She dumped me.
we're still good friends.

834
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:01,395
Really?

835
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:02,754
Hey, wait.
Like, how good?

836
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:04,673
Good friends.
Good good?

837
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:05,875
She is amazing.

838
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:12,753
All right, guys.

839
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:16,232
As you've probably noticed,
this certainly isn't English.

840
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:20,155
Um...
we've combined a few classes
today here for the seminar.

841
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:23,159
Hopefully,
the speaker will be
here any minute now.

842
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:28,112
Hi.
Hey! Oh, hi.

843
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:30,835
Uh...
You're here for
the sex talk?

844
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:34,390
well... I like a man
who gets right to the point.

845
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:36,235
Are you Pam?

846
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:37,919
If you say so.

847
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:39,555
OK.

848
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:43,592
This is Pam Kitterman.
She's leading us in
our sex discussion.

849
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:45,557
what? what?
Yes. Come on.

850
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:47,153
No, I'm... what?

851
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:49,475
I am not...
Oh, I am.

852
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:50,913
Right, that's correct.

853
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:53,510
Hi, I'm Pa...
I'm Pam. Hi.

854
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:55,639
Um, sex...

855
00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:02,115
well, yes, sex...
Um, what do
you say, you know?

856
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:05,839
Uh... you like a guy,
you do it with him.

857
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:07,956
Sometimes he calls,
sometimes he doesn't.

858
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:10,238
whoo!

859
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:14,589
Oh.

860
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:15,874
Hi.

861
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:16,915
what are you doing here?

862
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,797
I came by to say hello.

863
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:21,349
Oh, my God,
your teacher is
such a fox!

864
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:22,629
He's coming back.

865
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:26,236
Um, why don't we
talk about that later?

866
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:29,955
And I just wanna say
that the burning
sensation is totally normal.

867
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:31,629
Ew!

868
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:34,078
Sex is really fun.

869
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:38,154
when you're old enough,

870
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:40,117
which none of you are.

871
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:41,799
I should know.

872
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:45,916
Cos when you lose it to
some guy named Junior
with bad breath

873
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:50,437
in the back of a van,
you're gonna wish
you'd listened to your mom

874
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:52,875
when she said
"Nobody will buy
the ice-cream truck

875
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:55,838
"when you're handin' out
the Popsicles for free."

876
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:00,673
Any questions?

877
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:11,070
Oh, I know it's hard.
I mean, difficult.
Difficult.

878
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:14,038
But safe sex is
really important.

879
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:17,352
OK, so just imagine

880
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:20,432
that the bananas
are the real thing.

881
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:24,509
In a land called
Every Man's Fantasy.

882
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:27,392
God, I can't do this.

883
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:32,873
Maybe because
we're not supposed to be
having sex with bananas.

884
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:36,636
Do you really think she
hooked up with Rob?

885
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:38,233
They're so different.

886
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:40,197
Sometimes opposites attract.

887
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:42,357
You know what, though?

888
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:44,358
I feel like I'm
really ready to do it.

889
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:48,591
You know, like,
have sex for the first time.

890
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:52,869
It's a big deal.

891
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:54,069
I know.

892
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:55,718
Just make sure
you've found
the right person.

893
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:57,518
You know,
Adelie penguins,

894
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:01,869
they spend their whole lives
looking for that
one other penguin.

895
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:04,390
And when they
meet them, they know.

896
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:08,112
And they spend the rest
of their lives together.

897
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:09,395
But I'm not a penguin.

898
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:10,874
It's an analogy.

899
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:16,039
Excuse me.

900
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:17,799
I have to go die now.

901
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:23,993
Hey, kids,
Sydney here.
Bad news about the prom.

902
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:27,270
East Glen East is gonna
do "Millennium", too.

903
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:31,718
what? Oh, my God.

904
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:37,476
Calm down.
Calm down!

905
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:39,232
Calm down! Sit!

906
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:43,678
Let's focus, all right?

907
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:46,593
It's prom theme.
All we need is a new idea.

908
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:49,475
Ooh! How about
"Under the Sea"?

909
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:51,879
Yeah, right.

910
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:52,995
It's been done.

911
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:54,115
How about "the '80s"?

912
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:58,517
what do you think we are?
Amateurs?

913
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:03,957
All right.
All right.

914
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:05,549
Josie.

915
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:09,312
That's not a theme.

916
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:11,876
Thank you. No.

917
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:15,630
OK,
Josie will have the answer.

918
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:29,832
How about
"Meant for Each Other"?

919
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:32,475
Famous couples
throughout history.

920
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:38,999
Absolutely.

921
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:40,433
Absolutely!

922
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:42,553
Oh, we love it.

923
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:43,795
That is so brilliant.

924
00:59:56,320 --> 00:59:59,392
Here comes a sign
in the form of a girl

925
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:04,156
She's the finest,
sweetest thing in the world

926
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:07,915
Oh, take you
to Heaven tonight

927
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:12,557
I feel the horses
coming galloping

928
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:14,232
In the summer ends

929
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:16,959
Take you to Heaven tonight

930
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:20,555
Oh, 'cause I love you

931
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:22,870
For what you are

932
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:31,552
Tonight, tonight we'll ride

933
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:34,518
I'll give it to you

934
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:38,434
we'll go to Heaven tonight

935
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:43,037
Tonight

936
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:46,798
Here, try these.

937
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:54,553
No, Gus, listen.
It is a great story.

938
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:56,836
They keep the tags on,

939
01:00:56,920 --> 01:00:59,593
and then they
return the clothes
after they've worn them.

940
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:01,829
Gus?

941
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:03,717
Hi.
what's up?

942
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:06,388
I was just looking
at this cardigan.

943
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:08,079
Isn't it cool?
Oh, yes.

944
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:18,354
Oh, my God.
Like, there goes
another lemming.

945
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:22,516
I can't believe
that I could be happy

946
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:26,229
Summer will come again
I could be happy

947
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:29,869
Oh, stop your crying
You could be happy

948
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:33,589
Go to Heaven
when you make me happy

949
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:40,880
Good play!
Good play!

950
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:43,239
Go, sexy boy!

951
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:45,038
You guys,
victory dance.

952
01:01:45,120 --> 01:01:46,269
Oh, yeah.

953
01:01:46,360 --> 01:01:48,999
Rager party, tonight
at my house, baby. Yeah!

954
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:50,559
Yeah! whoo!

955
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:52,198
Great play, Rob.

956
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:55,317
You might be just
what South Glen needs
to win State this year.

957
01:01:56,520 --> 01:01:58,431
will I play in
the championship game?

958
01:01:58,520 --> 01:02:00,112
You'll start at shortstop.

959
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:02,077
I don't wanna put
extra pressure on you,

960
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:04,276
but some pro
scouts will be there.

961
01:02:04,360 --> 01:02:06,271
Thanks, Coach Romano.

962
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:07,549
You're welcome.

963
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:09,710
Just glad to be
part of a team again.

964
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:15,794
Josie, you have
totally transitioned.

965
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:18,199
Transitioned?

966
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:19,833
Yeah, you crossed over.

967
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:21,194
Into our group.

968
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:22,349
It's hard.

969
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:25,512
People go through high school
trying to transition
and never make it.

970
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:26,874
wannabes.

971
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:32,835
Guy is totally
crunching on you.

972
01:02:40,280 --> 01:02:42,157
Do I wanna be crunched?

973
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:43,674
By Guy?

974
01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:45,748
Oh, yeah.

975
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:56,549
Josie!

976
01:02:57,120 --> 01:02:58,155
Hi.

977
01:02:58,640 --> 01:03:00,232
"Splendiferous"?

978
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:01,588
Totally!

979
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:06,199
I'm not going to her again.
She calls that a pedicure?

980
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:12,669
She wants me.

981
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:17,709
Bye. Out.

982
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:21,156
Night. Bye. Miss Haskell
is gone and forgotten.

983
01:03:21,320 --> 01:03:26,553
Sack races
at the company picnic,
yes or no?

984
01:03:29,960 --> 01:03:31,473
Sorry I'm late.

985
01:03:31,560 --> 01:03:33,152
I love that top.
Thank you.

986
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:34,229
So cute.

987
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:35,389
It's all about horseshoes.

988
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:37,835
Excuse me,
I'm trying to get
to a tennis game.

989
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:40,957
what is the status
of your story?

990
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:43,959
Oh, great.
Totally rufus.

991
01:03:44,560 --> 01:03:46,312
Is there
something I could see?

992
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:47,913
Rufus?

993
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,319
I have some notes.

994
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:54,877
I don't need your notes.
I need your story.

995
01:03:55,720 --> 01:03:57,631
Though I must speak
for all of us here.

996
01:03:57,720 --> 01:04:00,757
I have seen your tapes.
Compelling stuff.

997
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:04,512
But I want
the story in two weeks.

998
01:04:04,600 --> 01:04:06,238
Two weeks,
Miss Geller.

999
01:04:06,360 --> 01:04:08,954
Or I'll rufus you
right outta here.

1000
01:04:09,040 --> 01:04:11,190
I think you're gonna
be a great reporter.

1001
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:15,273
But if you aren't,
you and Gus are fired.

1002
01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:19,709
Next order of business:

1003
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:21,791
marketing department,
yes or no?

1004
01:04:28,520 --> 01:04:29,919
Party's at Rob's!

1005
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:47,949
Josie.

1006
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:52,954
Hello, you guys.

1007
01:04:55,560 --> 01:04:56,549
Hi.

1008
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:58,756
I'm Rob's prom date.

1009
01:04:58,840 --> 01:05:00,273
Really?
Yeah.

1010
01:05:00,360 --> 01:05:02,157
Oh, my God. wow!

1011
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:07,470
Yeah. Yeah,
she's 1 6 years old, Rob.

1012
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:09,477
I know, and a gymnast.

1013
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:14,551
It's totally illegal,
and I'll tell you why.
The following reasons are...

1014
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:17,755
Hi.

1015
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:19,229
Hi.

1016
01:05:19,320 --> 01:05:20,673
Hey, dude.

1017
01:05:21,600 --> 01:05:23,795
I gotta talk to you.

1018
01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:24,915
Please come here.

1019
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:28,037
I'll see you
around the cellblock,
Mrs. Robinson.

1020
01:05:33,040 --> 01:05:36,157
Hey, Rob.
what do you wanna be
when you grow up?

1021
01:05:37,160 --> 01:05:38,309
Ball player.

1022
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:41,790
No, I know,
but, I mean,
what if you don't make it?

1023
01:05:42,320 --> 01:05:44,834
I mean,
you don't wanna be
working at the mail place

1024
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:46,951
for the rest
of your life.

1025
01:05:47,120 --> 01:05:49,190
It's OK for an after-school
job and all,

1026
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:52,829
but "Hi, I'm Rob,
and I run the Tiki Post"?

1027
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:56,679
Totally lame!

1028
01:06:02,360 --> 01:06:05,796
what is this?
Like a lemon-meringue pie
color or something?

1029
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:07,677
It's... Ugh.

1030
01:06:09,560 --> 01:06:11,039
You know what?

1031
01:06:11,640 --> 01:06:13,676
Maybe we should go
into another room.

1032
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:15,955
I've checked every
one of these rooms.

1033
01:06:16,040 --> 01:06:19,635
There's, I mean,
serious couples in there.

1034
01:06:19,720 --> 01:06:21,438
This is fine.
This is fine.

1035
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:31,950
Someone's gettin'
hooked up!

1036
01:06:32,080 --> 01:06:33,399
Yeah, baby!

1037
01:06:40,920 --> 01:06:41,955
wow.

1038
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:45,075
Rob's sister is a loser.

1039
01:06:46,760 --> 01:06:47,875
Yeah.

1040
01:06:51,080 --> 01:06:52,911
Um...
Please come here.

1041
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:56,439
I need to talk to you
about something.

1042
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:01,438
It's a comfy bed.

1043
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:02,549
OK.

1044
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:04,756
Feel it.
It's nice.
It's nice.

1045
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:08,269
Uh...

1046
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:11,591
I know that you've
probably already heard

1047
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:14,114
that I want to
ask you out to prom.

1048
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:19,314
But there's
something different
about asking in person.

1049
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:24,717
I know that we
didn't hit it off
in the beginning.

1050
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:27,556
And I really...

1051
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:28,709
Yes.

1052
01:07:30,320 --> 01:07:31,435
Yes.

1053
01:07:34,040 --> 01:07:35,519
That's rufus.

1054
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:40,558
Uh... where do I
pick you up?

1055
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:42,471
How do we arrange this?
what do I do?

1056
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:46,557
we can meet
here at Rob's,

1057
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:49,632
and we can all share
a limousine together.

1058
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:54,639
Thank you.

1059
01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:00,437
Have a good evening.

1060
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:02,479
And thank you.

1061
01:08:14,560 --> 01:08:16,391
Hey, Jose.
Hey, Rob.

1062
01:08:16,480 --> 01:08:18,152
Lookin' good, guys.

1063
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:21,075
Josie, Robster,
rufus kegger.

1064
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:22,952
Man, you were wasted.

1065
01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:25,436
This is so unbelievable.

1066
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:29,633
I've waited my
whole life to fit in,
and I finally feel like I do.

1067
01:08:29,840 --> 01:08:30,955
You do.

1068
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:32,189
Hey, Rob.

1069
01:08:32,280 --> 01:08:35,477
Hey, Josie,
who did Archie date?
Betty or Veronica?

1070
01:08:35,760 --> 01:08:37,193
Both.
See?

1071
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:39,875
I always liked Betty better.

1072
01:08:40,240 --> 01:08:41,434
Really?

1073
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:43,397
Yeah,
Betty was so
fun and spunky.

1074
01:08:43,480 --> 01:08:45,710
I mean,
Veronica had
the great legs.

1075
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:48,553
She was too moody.
Very high-maintenance.

1076
01:08:48,920 --> 01:08:51,832
You can't refuse to
sell me a ticket to prom.

1077
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:52,989
Listen, Alpo.

1078
01:08:53,080 --> 01:08:55,036
we can do
whatever we want to.

1079
01:08:55,400 --> 01:08:57,675
Like, I get it.
You guys don't know
how to count change.

1080
01:08:58,480 --> 01:08:59,879
Oh, my God.
I'll make it easy.

1081
01:08:59,960 --> 01:09:01,313
Here's the money.
I'm taking the ticket.

1082
01:09:05,160 --> 01:09:06,513
Oh, my God.

1083
01:09:07,240 --> 01:09:08,912
She was mocking us.

1084
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:09,950
Did you see that?

1085
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:11,593
we gotta
make her dog food.

1086
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:12,669
She is going down.

1087
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:15,709
There.

1088
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:24,072
Oh. I got you a meeting
with the admissions guy
from Dartmouth.

1089
01:09:24,840 --> 01:09:26,159
Dartmouth?

1090
01:09:26,480 --> 01:09:29,438
But I wasn't
gonna go to college.

1091
01:09:29,560 --> 01:09:31,596
No, I pulled some strings,

1092
01:09:32,160 --> 01:09:33,673
and I got him to
look at your writing,

1093
01:09:33,760 --> 01:09:35,193
and he agreed
to meet with you.

1094
01:09:37,120 --> 01:09:38,792
You believe in me
that much?

1095
01:09:39,880 --> 01:09:41,199
Of course I do, Josie.

1096
01:09:41,320 --> 01:09:44,437
You owe it to yourself,
to your writing,
to go to college.

1097
01:09:45,400 --> 01:09:47,277
You are a great writer.

1098
01:09:48,280 --> 01:09:50,589
You just have to
find your story.

1099
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:54,519
He is your story.

1100
01:09:54,760 --> 01:09:56,591
You're crazy. No!

1101
01:09:57,080 --> 01:09:59,275
No. No.

1102
01:09:59,480 --> 01:10:02,278
what do you mean, no?
It's got it all.

1103
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:05,876
Sex, intrigue, immorality
in the education system.

1104
01:10:06,080 --> 01:10:07,229
He's my teacher.

1105
01:10:07,320 --> 01:10:09,038
Yeah, that's the best part.

1106
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:11,793
"Student-teacher relations:
how close is too close?"

1107
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:14,075
we're gonna blow
the lid off it!

1108
01:10:14,160 --> 01:10:15,718
There's no lid.

1109
01:10:16,120 --> 01:10:18,714
There's nothing
going on between Sa...

1110
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:20,358
Mr. Coulson and me.

1111
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:23,554
Everyone is
in here every day,
watching you two.

1112
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:25,471
It's like
The Young and the Restless.

1113
01:10:25,560 --> 01:10:27,676
Rigfort is
salivating over it.

1114
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:29,751
You pitched this
to Rigfort?

1115
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:32,716
Josie, this isn't a joke.

1116
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:35,075
You heard Rigfort.
Both our asses
are on the line.

1117
01:10:35,160 --> 01:10:37,071
Now, this is the story.

1118
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:39,910
Call me when
you've got it.

1119
01:11:01,160 --> 01:11:02,513
Josie, you look so...

1120
01:11:02,920 --> 01:11:04,069
Rufus?

1121
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:07,320
Yes, exactly.
Major rufus.

1122
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:09,788
what are you
supposed to be?

1123
01:11:10,360 --> 01:11:11,395
Duh!

1124
01:11:14,840 --> 01:11:16,796
Tom Cruise,
Risky Business.

1125
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:20,713
That's nice.

1126
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:26,275
Thank you for
everything, Rob.

1127
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:29,876
It's all really happening,

1128
01:11:30,280 --> 01:11:32,510
and I know it's
because of you.

1129
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:41,597
My wallet. Shit.

1130
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:43,799
where are you
gonna put it?

1131
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:13,916
Come on, beautiful.
Let's go.

1132
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:29,519
Hey, how you doin'?

1133
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:30,749
Hello?

1134
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:34,352
If you don't hurry,
we'll miss the whole thing.

1135
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:36,359
we'll talk.

1136
01:12:42,120 --> 01:12:45,590
Oh, my God.
You totally ripped off
my Malibu Barbie idea!

1137
01:12:46,120 --> 01:12:48,031
Uh-uh.
I'm Disco Barbie.

1138
01:12:48,160 --> 01:12:49,593
And I'm Evening Gown Barbie.

1139
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:54,992
Josie, darling,
you look rufus.

1140
01:12:55,080 --> 01:12:56,877
who are you guys?

1141
01:12:56,960 --> 01:12:59,633
Don't tell me.
You're Medieval Barbie?

1142
01:12:59,720 --> 01:13:00,869
Get over it.

1143
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:02,916
we're Rosalind and Orlando.

1144
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:05,669
Shakespeare?

1145
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:09,317
Look, I get to
have a sword.

1146
01:13:10,040 --> 01:13:13,316
Oh, my God,
that is so awesome.

1147
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:15,559
Rad! That is so rad.

1148
01:13:15,640 --> 01:13:16,959
I want a sword.

1149
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:22,634
All right,
look at this place!

1150
01:13:22,720 --> 01:13:24,392
Beautiful.

1151
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:26,994
Come on,
let's dance.
I'm Tom Cruise.

1152
01:13:36,080 --> 01:13:38,310
This is the most
beautiful prom
I've ever been to.

1153
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:41,075
work, Merk,
work, Merk, work it.

1154
01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:47,029
Great.

1155
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:51,709
what are you doing?

1156
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:54,872
Practicing my
surprised face for when
they name prom court.

1157
01:13:56,920 --> 01:13:59,673
Oh, sorry, there's
no room at this table.

1158
01:14:01,040 --> 01:14:02,712
It's just
too bad for them.

1159
01:14:05,120 --> 01:14:06,633
wait, I forgot.

1160
01:14:07,880 --> 01:14:09,359
A little surprise for you.

1161
01:14:09,640 --> 01:14:10,959
Did I miss the crowning?

1162
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:12,598
No, but I'm
closing the pool.

1163
01:14:12,680 --> 01:14:14,716
Josie's odds are 3-1,

1164
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:18,031
and even money that
that kid pokes
himself with the sword.

1165
01:14:26,200 --> 01:14:27,269
whoa!

1166
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:30,152
OK, maybe we
should sit down.

1167
01:14:30,240 --> 01:14:31,468
OK.

1168
01:14:31,560 --> 01:14:32,834
OK. whoa.

1169
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:36,877
Are you having fun yet?

1170
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:38,791
Uh, yeah.
Good.

1171
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:39,949
Definitely.

1172
01:14:40,040 --> 01:14:41,553
Guess what.
what?

1173
01:14:41,640 --> 01:14:43,676
Gibby gave me champagne!

1174
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:44,988
That's nice.

1175
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:46,195
Yeah.

1176
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:49,595
Rob? I've been thinking.

1177
01:14:51,640 --> 01:14:53,153
And I think...

1178
01:14:53,560 --> 01:14:55,073
I mean, I know

1179
01:14:56,040 --> 01:14:57,553
you're the one.

1180
01:14:58,760 --> 01:14:59,795
Oh.

1181
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:02,113
My penguin.

1182
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:04,631
I want you to
be my first.

1183
01:15:05,800 --> 01:15:09,076
Once the floor
stops spinning,
let's have sex.

1184
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:11,556
You're gonna hurt yourself.
Put that down.

1185
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:16,473
All right.

1186
01:15:18,440 --> 01:15:19,668
Tell you what, Tracy.

1187
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:20,875
what?

1188
01:15:22,200 --> 01:15:23,679
I'm flattered,

1189
01:15:24,240 --> 01:15:25,912
but I say

1190
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:28,915
I'm gonna go
get some more punch,

1191
01:15:29,080 --> 01:15:31,594
then we'll go on
the dance floor
and boogie.

1192
01:15:32,720 --> 01:15:33,755
That's good.

1193
01:15:33,880 --> 01:15:35,438
No! Uh-oh!

1194
01:15:36,160 --> 01:15:37,639
Help! I'm stuck.

1195
01:15:37,760 --> 01:15:38,795
Brett!

1196
01:15:39,880 --> 01:15:41,950
The Denominators
are here!

1197
01:15:42,720 --> 01:15:43,789
whoo!

1198
01:15:46,840 --> 01:15:49,479
Make way
for the Denominators!

1199
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:52,234
You guys,
what is the one thing

1200
01:15:52,360 --> 01:15:54,590
that could ruin
my senior prom?

1201
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:58,952
That you would trip
on your Barbie heels
and I'd be named prom queen.

1202
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:01,868
Did I just
say that out loud?

1203
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:04,075
whoo!

1204
01:16:13,560 --> 01:16:15,198
So, who are you
supposed to be?

1205
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:16,918
Other than freaks?
Yeah.

1206
01:16:17,320 --> 01:16:19,311
we're DNA.
Double helix?

1207
01:16:19,960 --> 01:16:22,428
But I guess you'd
actually know that
if you passed bio.

1208
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,434
No, no,
don't touch the hydrogen.
It's rented.

1209
01:16:27,800 --> 01:16:29,233
Yo, yo,
ladies and gentlemen,

1210
01:16:29,320 --> 01:16:32,676
give it up for Mr. Coulson
and Miss Knox!

1211
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:37,876
OK, OK, enough.

1212
01:16:38,840 --> 01:16:40,751
Our 1999 prom court.

1213
01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:43,351
And the princesses are,

1214
01:16:44,760 --> 01:16:45,954
Miss Kristin Davis...

1215
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:51,952
Miss Kirsten Leosis
and Miss Gibby Zarefsky.

1216
01:16:57,120 --> 01:16:58,872
And the princes are:

1217
01:16:59,480 --> 01:17:01,232
Mr. Thomas Salamey...

1218
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:05,352
Mr. Jason way...

1219
01:17:06,200 --> 01:17:08,031
and Mr. Rob...

1220
01:17:08,840 --> 01:17:10,034
Mr. Rob.

1221
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:12,108
Mr. Rob!

1222
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:13,952
Mr. Rob.

1223
01:17:15,440 --> 01:17:16,759
That's me!

1224
01:17:17,680 --> 01:17:18,908
Yeah!

1225
01:17:19,640 --> 01:17:20,868
whoo!

1226
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:28,109
Next up,
South Glen 's prom king,

1227
01:17:29,160 --> 01:17:30,559
Guy Perkins.

1228
01:17:39,560 --> 01:17:41,596
And this year's prom queen.

1229
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:45,273
Ladies and gentlemen...

1230
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:51,399
Josie Geller!

1231
01:17:58,880 --> 01:17:59,949
Yeah!

1232
01:18:24,120 --> 01:18:25,792
I knew you could
do it, girl.

1233
01:18:33,040 --> 01:18:35,235
And as is custom,
the king and the queen

1234
01:18:35,320 --> 01:18:37,515
will now have
their first dance.

1235
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,116
I never made it
to my prom.

1236
01:19:03,200 --> 01:19:04,394
Really?

1237
01:19:05,280 --> 01:19:07,669
I only made it to
the parking lot.

1238
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:13,956
Tell me what
you're thinking.

1239
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,309
I was thinking
about Shakespeare,

1240
01:19:18,040 --> 01:19:20,508
how he described
a night like this.

1241
01:19:22,720 --> 01:19:28,636
"Look how the floor of heaven
is thick inlaid with
patines of bright gold."

1242
01:19:30,200 --> 01:19:32,316
what are you
thinking about?

1243
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:35,548
My sword.

1244
01:19:37,720 --> 01:19:38,755
Oh.

1245
01:19:42,280 --> 01:19:44,236
Josie,
you rock my world.

1246
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:48,829
You're, like,
the most amazing girl
that I've ever dated.

1247
01:19:52,200 --> 01:19:54,839
You're so fun to be with.
You're smart,

1248
01:19:55,400 --> 01:19:56,799
you're crazy.

1249
01:19:56,880 --> 01:19:58,199
You are...

1250
01:19:59,160 --> 01:20:00,832
You rock my world.

1251
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:04,757
You said that already.

1252
01:20:05,720 --> 01:20:06,789
Yeah.

1253
01:20:07,520 --> 01:20:11,638
Erase and rewind

1254
01:20:11,720 --> 01:20:16,635
'Cause I've been
changing my mind

1255
01:20:16,720 --> 01:20:21,077
I've changed my mind

1256
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:36,277
Is this chocolate? OK.

1257
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:39,995
Hey.

1258
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:41,115
Hi.

1259
01:20:42,600 --> 01:20:45,512
wow, you make a really
beautiful prom queen.

1260
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:46,954
Really?

1261
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:49,272
Thanks. So do you.

1262
01:20:50,480 --> 01:20:52,869
I always feel like
kind of a goofball
in these penguin suits,

1263
01:20:52,960 --> 01:20:54,996
Iike I'm at
my own wedding.

1264
01:20:58,080 --> 01:21:00,071
Do you...
Do you wanna...

1265
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:05,035
OK.

1266
01:21:07,480 --> 01:21:08,629
Hello.

1267
01:21:09,680 --> 01:21:11,272
Aldys, I figured
that since it's prom,

1268
01:21:11,880 --> 01:21:14,030
Iet's put all
the shit behind us.

1269
01:21:14,120 --> 01:21:16,793
I would love nothing more
than to dance with you.

1270
01:21:22,480 --> 01:21:23,799
All right.

1271
01:21:24,680 --> 01:21:28,150
That's, of course,
if it's OK with the rest
of the double helix.

1272
01:21:28,840 --> 01:21:30,068
Yes? OK.

1273
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:55,950
You know, it's funny.
Proms always make
me a little sad.

1274
01:21:56,040 --> 01:21:57,234
They're so final,
you know?

1275
01:21:57,320 --> 01:22:00,118
Graduation,
everyone scattering,
moving on.

1276
01:22:02,320 --> 01:22:04,276
Is your girlfriend here?

1277
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:07,397
No. No, I'm alone.

1278
01:22:09,320 --> 01:22:12,676
In fact,
we broke up last week.

1279
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:14,989
Really?

1280
01:22:15,400 --> 01:22:17,675
That's funny
because, actually,

1281
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:19,955
"prom" comes from
"promenade",

1282
01:22:20,080 --> 01:22:21,877
and you can't
promenade alone, can you?

1283
01:22:23,840 --> 01:22:26,035
You're amazing,
Josie Geller.

1284
01:22:56,240 --> 01:22:58,993
Have you thought about
Dartmouth any more?

1285
01:23:00,840 --> 01:23:01,875
Yes.

1286
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:07,712
And there's something
that I wanna tell you.

1287
01:23:15,960 --> 01:23:18,030
No, no, no.
Not now, not now!

1288
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:25,155
There's something
I wanna tell you, too.

1289
01:24:04,600 --> 01:24:06,352
No! No!

1290
01:24:16,640 --> 01:24:19,108
I knew it!
You are a loser!

1291
01:24:19,480 --> 01:24:21,311
You ruined everything!

1292
01:24:21,440 --> 01:24:24,034
You so do not
deserve to be prom queen!

1293
01:24:25,520 --> 01:24:27,556
Let me tell you something.

1294
01:24:27,800 --> 01:24:31,190
I don't care about being
your stupid prom queen.

1295
01:24:32,040 --> 01:24:33,917
I'm 25 years old!

1296
01:24:34,400 --> 01:24:37,517
I'm an undercover reporter
for the Chicago Sun-Times.

1297
01:24:37,640 --> 01:24:40,279
And I have been
beating my brains out,

1298
01:24:40,840 --> 01:24:43,035
trying to impress you people!

1299
01:24:43,840 --> 01:24:47,469
Let me tell you something,
Gibby, Kirsten, Kristin.

1300
01:24:48,200 --> 01:24:51,715
You will spend your lives
trying to keep others down

1301
01:24:51,800 --> 01:24:54,519
because it makes you
feel more important!

1302
01:24:55,720 --> 01:24:56,948
why her?

1303
01:24:57,520 --> 01:25:00,273
Let me tell you
something about this girl.

1304
01:25:00,360 --> 01:25:02,112
She is unbelievable.

1305
01:25:02,840 --> 01:25:06,469
I was new here,
and she befriended me,
no questions asked.

1306
01:25:07,360 --> 01:25:12,150
But you,
you were only my friend
after my brother Rob

1307
01:25:13,280 --> 01:25:16,192
posed as a student
and told you to like me.

1308
01:25:17,880 --> 01:25:19,359
Robby Rob?
Ew.

1309
01:25:20,200 --> 01:25:23,431
All of you people,
there is a big
world out there.

1310
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:25,158
Bigger than prom,

1311
01:25:25,480 --> 01:25:26,833
bigger than high school,

1312
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:31,868
and it won't matter
if you were the prom queen

1313
01:25:33,720 --> 01:25:35,517
or the quarterback
of the football team

1314
01:25:37,560 --> 01:25:40,313
or the biggest nerd
in school.

1315
01:25:42,600 --> 01:25:44,397
Find out who you are

1316
01:25:45,240 --> 01:25:47,435
and try not to
be afraid of it.

1317
01:25:48,840 --> 01:25:50,193
Excuse me.

1318
01:25:58,560 --> 01:26:02,030
whoo! whoo! Yeah!

1319
01:26:03,480 --> 01:26:05,038
wow, that was
just like Carrie.

1320
01:26:05,120 --> 01:26:07,634
I thought she was
gonna kill us all.

1321
01:26:09,360 --> 01:26:11,635
All right, you guys.
Go, Rams!

1322
01:26:12,600 --> 01:26:13,828
All right.

1323
01:26:13,920 --> 01:26:17,515
Can somebody take
the Alpo girls outside
and hose 'em off?

1324
01:26:18,440 --> 01:26:20,670
South Glen,
class of 1999,

1325
01:26:21,120 --> 01:26:23,031
are you ready to party?

1326
01:26:32,440 --> 01:26:34,670
we lost the feed.
Gus is goin' nuts.

1327
01:26:34,760 --> 01:26:36,113
He's calling
every five minutes.

1328
01:26:36,200 --> 01:26:38,077
Did you get the story?

1329
01:26:38,160 --> 01:26:39,388
No.

1330
01:26:39,480 --> 01:26:41,596
Tell me you got
something on Coulson.

1331
01:26:41,680 --> 01:26:42,715
No!

1332
01:26:51,960 --> 01:26:53,632
I'm just gonna go.

1333
01:27:04,720 --> 01:27:08,474
So... Surprise.

1334
01:27:10,880 --> 01:27:12,916
"Surprise",
you were doing
a story on me?

1335
01:27:13,040 --> 01:27:14,871
No, I couldn't.

1336
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:18,436
I mean, "surprise",
I was hoping...

1337
01:27:18,520 --> 01:27:19,635
what?

1338
01:27:20,040 --> 01:27:22,395
what?
You were hoping what?
That I'd be happy?

1339
01:27:22,480 --> 01:27:25,313
Because suddenly
I was allowed to be
attracted to you?

1340
01:27:25,760 --> 01:27:27,352
You were attracted to me?

1341
01:27:27,440 --> 01:27:28,509
Goddamn it.

1342
01:27:28,600 --> 01:27:30,238
You set me up
for a story.

1343
01:27:30,320 --> 01:27:31,673
No, I... I...

1344
01:27:32,200 --> 01:27:33,872
Just drop the act.

1345
01:27:34,480 --> 01:27:35,515
OK?

1346
01:27:36,680 --> 01:27:39,717
I mean, every word
out of your mouth
has been a complete lie.

1347
01:27:41,360 --> 01:27:42,998
I don't know you at all.

1348
01:27:43,080 --> 01:27:45,753
Look, if we
could just spend
some time together,

1349
01:27:45,840 --> 01:27:48,070
you could
get to know me again.

1350
01:27:54,280 --> 01:27:56,396
wait, please
don't walk away.

1351
01:27:59,080 --> 01:28:01,674
I just can't look
at you the same way.

1352
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:21,549
Rob.

1353
01:28:22,760 --> 01:28:24,352
Hey, Josie.

1354
01:28:24,440 --> 01:28:26,874
I came by to check on you.
I was worried about you.

1355
01:28:27,320 --> 01:28:28,799
Really?

1356
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:31,075
No, not really.

1357
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:34,233
Not really, Josie.

1358
01:28:35,400 --> 01:28:37,630
How could you
do this to me?

1359
01:28:37,720 --> 01:28:39,790
I helped you.
I got you everything
you wanted.

1360
01:28:39,880 --> 01:28:42,917
And you repay me by
blowing everything

1361
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:45,150
two days before
the championship!

1362
01:28:45,240 --> 01:28:46,719
I wasn't even thinking.

1363
01:28:46,840 --> 01:28:48,398
No, you weren't.

1364
01:28:49,640 --> 01:28:51,949
Did it occur to you
that the only time

1365
01:28:52,040 --> 01:28:53,473
I've been happy in
the past five years

1366
01:28:53,560 --> 01:28:57,758
is when I'm playing ball,
when I'm part of a team?

1367
01:28:57,840 --> 01:29:00,195
Josie, it's not even
about playing.

1368
01:29:00,280 --> 01:29:01,793
I taught those guys things.

1369
01:29:01,880 --> 01:29:04,235
I helped 'em.
My life had meaning.

1370
01:29:04,760 --> 01:29:05,829
I...

1371
01:29:06,760 --> 01:29:08,273
Just forget about it.

1372
01:29:08,360 --> 01:29:11,352
It's over.
Back to the Tiki Post.
Totally lame.

1373
01:29:13,320 --> 01:29:15,550
"Josie Geller
Blows Her Cover."

1374
01:29:16,440 --> 01:29:18,192
And we were scooped.

1375
01:29:18,880 --> 01:29:21,030
we've got nothing. Zippo.

1376
01:29:22,760 --> 01:29:26,309
Josie,
you totally and completely
screwed both of us.

1377
01:29:28,840 --> 01:29:31,638
Maybe I could
talk to Rigfort.

1378
01:29:31,760 --> 01:29:33,352
Tell him the whole story.

1379
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:35,715
You know,
I'll tell you a story, OK?

1380
01:29:36,640 --> 01:29:39,438
It's about this
shy copy editor

1381
01:29:39,560 --> 01:29:43,030
who makes a total mockery
of herself and her boss

1382
01:29:43,120 --> 01:29:47,033
when she completely
botches her first
assignment as a reporter.

1383
01:29:51,160 --> 01:29:53,390
we are not screwed.

1384
01:29:54,480 --> 01:29:56,311
Yes, I made a mistake.

1385
01:29:56,760 --> 01:29:58,876
But we will
have a story, OK?

1386
01:29:59,160 --> 01:30:02,789
You will have
an amazing story.

1387
01:30:09,880 --> 01:30:11,074
Please.

1388
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:14,877
Oh, please.
Oh, please.

1389
01:30:28,440 --> 01:30:30,396
Excuse me, gentlemen,

1390
01:30:30,480 --> 01:30:34,268
I suggest you cover up
what you don't want seen.

1391
01:30:34,360 --> 01:30:35,679
Thank you.

1392
01:30:41,400 --> 01:30:43,072
Coach Romano?
Yeah?

1393
01:30:43,320 --> 01:30:45,470
I'm Josie Geller
from the Chicago Sun-Times.

1394
01:30:45,560 --> 01:30:47,596
I have a favor
to ask you.

1395
01:30:47,680 --> 01:30:50,240
Do you know
the sports guy,
Jim Lakin?

1396
01:30:50,680 --> 01:30:52,352
Sure, everybody
tries to get Big Jim

1397
01:30:52,440 --> 01:30:54,670
to come watch
their games. why?

1398
01:30:55,160 --> 01:30:58,436
what if I told you
that I can guarantee you
that Big Jim

1399
01:30:58,520 --> 01:31:02,149
and every other
reporter in the area
would cover your game?

1400
01:31:03,120 --> 01:31:06,556
I'd say you
could have whatever
you wanted, young lady.

1401
01:31:08,720 --> 01:31:11,359
Someone once told me
that to write well,

1402
01:31:11,440 --> 01:31:13,715
you have to
write what you know.

1403
01:31:13,800 --> 01:31:15,472
This is what I know.

1404
01:31:15,560 --> 01:31:17,630
I am 25 years old,

1405
01:31:17,720 --> 01:31:20,280
and I have never really
kissed a guy.

1406
01:31:21,240 --> 01:31:24,232
A geek to the core,
most of my childhood
was spent

1407
01:31:24,320 --> 01:31:27,232
doing extra homework
I requested from the teacher.

1408
01:31:28,360 --> 01:31:30,157
High school was
more of the same.

1409
01:31:30,240 --> 01:31:34,631
Then, at 1 7,
it seemed as if my luck
was about to change.

1410
01:31:34,720 --> 01:31:37,553
The cutest guy asked me
to the senior prom.

1411
01:31:38,240 --> 01:31:41,391
But it turned out
he invited me
as a cruel joke,

1412
01:31:41,480 --> 01:31:43,391
and I have
never fully recovered.

1413
01:31:44,080 --> 01:31:47,390
Yes, it is embarrassing
to share this with the world.

1414
01:31:47,600 --> 01:31:49,158
But it would be
hard to explain

1415
01:31:49,240 --> 01:31:51,629
what I learned
and how I learned it

1416
01:31:51,720 --> 01:31:54,029
without sharing this
humiliating history.

1417
01:31:55,920 --> 01:31:59,071
I received an assignment,
my first as a reporter,

1418
01:31:59,560 --> 01:32:03,394
to go back
to high school and find out
about kids today.

1419
01:32:04,720 --> 01:32:07,154
what I ended up finding
was myself,

1420
01:32:07,880 --> 01:32:10,394
and that high school
hasn 't changed.

1421
01:32:11,280 --> 01:32:14,829
There's still that
one teacher who marches
to her own drummer.

1422
01:32:15,920 --> 01:32:18,036
Those girls are still there,

1423
01:32:18,120 --> 01:32:20,111
the ones that,
even as you grow up,

1424
01:32:20,200 --> 01:32:24,159
will remain
the most beautiful girls
you have ever seen close up.

1425
01:32:25,880 --> 01:32:29,714
The smart kids,
who everyone else
knew as the brains,

1426
01:32:29,840 --> 01:32:32,957
but I just knew them
as my soul mates,

1427
01:32:33,040 --> 01:32:36,032
my teachers, my friends.

1428
01:32:38,520 --> 01:32:41,080
And there's still
that one guy,

1429
01:32:41,200 --> 01:32:43,191
with his
mysterious confidence,

1430
01:32:43,280 --> 01:32:46,397
who seems so perfect
in every way.

1431
01:32:46,480 --> 01:32:49,950
The guy you get up
and go to school for
in the morning.

1432
01:32:50,480 --> 01:32:53,313
South Glen
would not have been
the same without him.

1433
01:32:53,400 --> 01:32:56,676
High school
would not have been
the same without him.

1434
01:32:57,640 --> 01:33:00,473
I would not have
been the same
without him.

1435
01:33:03,960 --> 01:33:08,272
I lived a lifetime of regret
after my first
high-school experience.

1436
01:33:08,560 --> 01:33:12,553
And now, after my second,
my regrets are down to one.

1437
01:33:13,960 --> 01:33:17,669
A certain teacher
was hurt on my path
to self-discovery,

1438
01:33:18,080 --> 01:33:21,277
and, although this article
may serve as a step,

1439
01:33:21,520 --> 01:33:24,398
it in no way makes up
for what I did to him.

1440
01:33:25,240 --> 01:33:28,437
To this man,
you know who you are,

1441
01:33:30,160 --> 01:33:31,639
I am so sorry.

1442
01:33:33,080 --> 01:33:35,196
And I would like to
add one more thing...

1443
01:33:36,400 --> 01:33:37,753
Movers.

1444
01:33:37,880 --> 01:33:39,438
Hang on a second.

1445
01:33:39,520 --> 01:33:41,750
I think I am
in love with you.

1446
01:33:42,480 --> 01:33:44,391
And so I propose this,

1447
01:33:44,480 --> 01:33:46,072
as an ending
to this article,

1448
01:33:46,160 --> 01:33:49,311
and perhaps a beginning to
the next chapter of my life,

1449
01:33:49,400 --> 01:33:51,231
I, Josie Geller,

1450
01:33:51,320 --> 01:33:54,039
will be at the state
championship baseball game,

1451
01:33:54,120 --> 01:33:57,874
where my friends,
the South Glen Rams,
are playing for the title.

1452
01:33:57,960 --> 01:33:59,837
I will stand on
the pitcher's mound

1453
01:33:59,920 --> 01:34:02,753
for five minutes,
prior to the first pitch.

1454
01:34:03,480 --> 01:34:05,994
If this man
accepts my apology,

1455
01:34:06,560 --> 01:34:08,551
I ask him to come kiss me

1456
01:34:09,160 --> 01:34:11,071
for my first real kiss.

1457
01:34:11,720 --> 01:34:13,631
Look over here!

1458
01:34:13,720 --> 01:34:15,233
Josie! Josie!

1459
01:34:17,800 --> 01:34:19,392
Thank you all for coming.

1460
01:34:19,480 --> 01:34:20,993
Josie!

1461
01:34:21,080 --> 01:34:24,550
Oh, my God. There's so
many people here.

1462
01:34:24,640 --> 01:34:28,110
They're behind you.
They feel like
they know you.

1463
01:34:28,720 --> 01:34:31,393
It's romantic,
and they wanna be
a part of it.

1464
01:34:31,720 --> 01:34:33,756
I'm glad that
you guys are.

1465
01:34:38,080 --> 01:34:39,433
Oh, Anita!

1466
01:34:41,520 --> 01:34:44,717
Sweet Jesus,
I had no idea there'd be
this many TV crews here.

1467
01:34:45,040 --> 01:34:46,632
You held up your
end of this bargain.

1468
01:34:46,720 --> 01:34:48,472
Now get out there
and get him!

1469
01:34:51,800 --> 01:34:53,916
Josie!
Josie! Josie!

1470
01:34:56,040 --> 01:34:58,076
Josie! Josie!
Josie! Josie!

1471
01:35:13,600 --> 01:35:17,115
Josie! we love you!

1472
01:35:18,440 --> 01:35:19,759
Thank you.

1473
01:35:21,760 --> 01:35:24,638
May I have
five minutes on
the clock, please?

1474
01:35:34,040 --> 01:35:35,075
Hi!

1475
01:35:39,280 --> 01:35:41,430
wieners!
I got hot wieners.

1476
01:35:41,520 --> 01:35:43,078
Hi, Mr. Rigfort.

1477
01:35:43,560 --> 01:35:45,755
Get in your own row!

1478
01:35:45,840 --> 01:35:46,909
I got wieners here.

1479
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:48,194
Give 'em to me.

1480
01:35:48,280 --> 01:35:49,838
Thank you, Gus.

1481
01:35:52,320 --> 01:35:53,833
Have a wiener.

1482
01:35:54,440 --> 01:35:55,998
I love this.

1483
01:35:56,160 --> 01:36:00,438
Sun-Times readers
out here en masse,

1484
01:36:00,520 --> 01:36:03,830
relating personally to
one of our reporters.

1485
01:36:04,360 --> 01:36:06,157
It's amazing,
isn't it?

1486
01:36:59,640 --> 01:37:01,198
Eight, seven...

1487
01:37:38,400 --> 01:37:40,038
That is so wrong.

1488
01:38:13,080 --> 01:38:14,069
wait.

1489
01:38:15,760 --> 01:38:16,795
Mr. Coulson!

1490
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,912
well, it's been
building up inside of me

1491
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:53,798
For, oh, I don't
know how long

1492
01:38:53,880 --> 01:38:55,518
Yeah, Mr. Coulson!

1493
01:38:55,680 --> 01:38:56,749
Yeah!

1494
01:38:56,840 --> 01:38:58,910
I don't know why
But I keep thinking

1495
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:03,312
Something's bound to go wrong

1496
01:39:03,400 --> 01:39:10,078
But she looks in my eyes
And makes me realize

1497
01:39:10,160 --> 01:39:15,280
And she says
Don't worry, Baby

1498
01:39:16,840 --> 01:39:20,628
Everything will
turn out all right

1499
01:39:21,360 --> 01:39:23,749
Don 't worry, Baby

1500
01:39:29,120 --> 01:39:30,678
Sorry I'm late.

1501
01:39:32,200 --> 01:39:34,430
It took me forever
to get here.

1502
01:39:38,840 --> 01:39:40,637
I know what you mean.

1503
01:39:44,760 --> 01:39:51,472
She makes me come alive
And makes me wanna drive

1504
01:39:51,560 --> 01:39:57,078
when she says
Don't worry, Baby

1505
01:39:58,680 --> 01:40:02,229
Everything will
turn out all right

1506
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:05,150
Don 't worry, Baby

1507
01:40:16,920 --> 01:40:18,273
All right.

1508
01:40:19,720 --> 01:40:20,948
Attagirl.

1509
01:40:21,840 --> 01:40:24,229
All right,
let's play ball, kids!
Come on!

1510
01:40:26,680 --> 01:40:29,831
She told me
Baby, when you race today

1511
01:40:29,960 --> 01:40:34,476
Just take along
my love with you

1512
01:40:34,560 --> 01:40:37,438
And if you knew
how much I loved you

1513
01:40:37,520 --> 01:40:41,433
Baby, nothing
could go wrong with you

1514
01:40:42,280 --> 01:40:46,114
Oh, what she does to me

1515
01:40:46,200 --> 01:40:49,510
when she makes love to me

1516
01:40:59,040 --> 01:41:02,669
Love is an innocent,
innocent journey

1517
01:41:02,760 --> 01:41:06,469
Love is the cancer,
love ain't benign

1518
01:41:06,560 --> 01:41:09,870
Love is what keeps you
going all the time now

1519
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:13,356
Love it, don't leave it,
don't leave it behind

1520
01:41:13,440 --> 01:41:15,476
Love is for free

1521
01:41:17,040 --> 01:41:19,315
when people like me

1522
01:41:20,920 --> 01:41:25,391
Crossing the seas,
to look for that someone

1523
01:41:27,960 --> 01:41:30,155
Love is for free

1524
01:41:31,320 --> 01:41:33,788
when people like me

1525
01:41:35,280 --> 01:41:36,918
Set their sights on you

1526
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:38,638
I'll know what to do

1527
01:41:38,720 --> 01:41:42,429
Love is what I came for
Love is what's in store for

1528
01:41:42,520 --> 01:41:45,956
Love is an innocent,
innocent journey

1529
01:41:46,040 --> 01:41:49,476
Love is a cancer,
love ain 't benign

1530
01:41:49,560 --> 01:41:53,269
Love is what keeps you
going all the time now

1531
01:41:53,360 --> 01:41:56,750
Love it, don 't leave it,
don 't leave it behind

1532
01:42:18,440 --> 01:42:20,874
Love is for free

1533
01:42:22,080 --> 01:42:24,196
when people like me

1534
01:42:25,600 --> 01:42:30,276
Crossing the seas,
looking for that
special someone

1535
01:42:32,880 --> 01:42:35,075
Love is for free

1536
01:42:36,440 --> 01:42:38,351
I've got eyes to see

1537
01:42:40,040 --> 01:42:41,678
Looking for someone

1538
01:42:41,800 --> 01:42:43,552
Love could come along

1539
01:42:43,640 --> 01:42:45,312
Love is what
you're waiting for

1540
01:42:45,400 --> 01:42:47,436
Love is what you came for

1541
01:42:47,520 --> 01:42:50,830
Love is an innocent,
innocent journey

1542
01:42:50,920 --> 01:42:54,310
Love is the cancer,
love ain 't benign

1543
01:42:54,400 --> 01:42:58,029
Love is what keeps you
going all the time now

1544
01:42:58,120 --> 01:43:03,148
Love it, don 't leave it,
don 't leave it

1545
01:43:03,280 --> 01:43:06,909
Love it, don 't leave it,
don 't leave it behind

1546
01:43:31,200 --> 01:43:33,953
Monday morning
came too soon

1547
01:43:35,800 --> 01:43:39,395
I think about you now
Layin ' in my room

1548
01:43:40,320 --> 01:43:44,711
Hearing everything you said

1549
01:43:44,800 --> 01:43:48,509
I play it back
A hundred times in my head

1550
01:43:49,360 --> 01:43:53,319
Then I slip into a dream

1551
01:43:53,400 --> 01:43:57,234
The feelin ' inside
Is ten stories high

1552
01:43:57,320 --> 01:44:01,472
Never knew what love was
Until you loved me

1553
01:44:01,560 --> 01:44:06,475
Never knew what love was
Oh, yeah

1554
01:44:06,560 --> 01:44:10,155
'Cause it feels
so good sometimes

1555
01:44:10,240 --> 01:44:15,109
Don 't you know
it feels so bad sometimes,

1556
01:44:15,200 --> 01:44:18,317
The way you loved me,
loved me

1557
01:44:19,680 --> 01:44:22,797
The way you loved me,
loved me

1558
01:44:43,960 --> 01:44:48,476
You know that I want you

1559
01:44:48,560 --> 01:44:51,757
You know that I need you

1560
01:44:51,840 --> 01:44:56,118
Never knew what love was
Until you loved me

1561
01:44:56,200 --> 01:45:00,671
Never knew what love was
Oh, yeah

1562
01:45:00,760 --> 01:45:04,673
'Cause it feels
so good sometimes

1563
01:45:04,760 --> 01:45:09,470
Don't you know
it feels so bad sometimes

1564
01:45:09,560 --> 01:45:12,597
The way you loved me,
loved me

1565
01:45:14,240 --> 01:45:17,198
The way you loved me,
loved me
