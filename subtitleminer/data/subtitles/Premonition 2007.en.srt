1
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,093
I hate surprises.
Yeah?

2
00:01:22,202 --> 00:01:22,534
Yes.

3
00:01:22,623 --> 00:01:24,158
You didn't mind when
I surprised you with my promotion.

4
00:01:24,325 --> 00:01:26,525
That wasn't a surprise, that was earned
by my genius husband.

5
00:01:28,448 --> 00:01:30,412
You see, I tought you really
like me for my body.

6
00:01:30,429 --> 00:01:31,930
I do like to feel your body.

7
00:01:32,631 --> 00:01:34,217
What are we doing here?

8
00:01:36,333 --> 00:01:39,013
Surprise.

9
00:01:40,735 --> 00:01:42,609
I don't understand, what is it?

10
00:01:42,736 --> 00:01:44,037
It's a house.

11
00:01:44,138 --> 00:01:47,239
Yes, yes, I can see that, thank you.

12
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:52,827
Also known as a home, sanctuary, dwelling.
Yeah.

13
00:01:52,882 --> 00:01:55,783
Or if you like,
you could just call it ours.

14
00:01:56,644 --> 00:01:59,145
Ours?
Uh-huh.

15
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:02,687
Where were we get the money, I mean,
how do we get into something like this?

16
00:02:03,508 --> 00:02:05,609
Oh, well..

17
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:10,011
Maybe with the.. key.

18
00:02:12,213 --> 00:02:17,714
Oh my god, oh my god,
are you kidding?

19
00:02:18,816 --> 00:02:20,816
It's a classic.

20
00:02:21,017 --> 00:02:24,926
1920's, good frame,
3 bedroom..

21
00:02:24,979 --> 00:02:28,080
And the old owners even left us
a brand new swing set out back.

22
00:02:33,185 --> 00:02:34,585
Thank you.

23
00:02:42,388 --> 00:02:44,659
I love you.
I love you too.

24
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:46,530
Let's go home.

25
00:03:10,457 --> 00:03:12,209
Mommy!
Uh?

26
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,440
When's daddy coming home?

27
00:03:14,441 --> 00:03:17,580
What, baby?
When's daddy coming home?

28
00:03:17,643 --> 00:03:23,145
Uh... Today, baby.
It was just an overnight trip.

29
00:03:23,806 --> 00:03:25,735
Why can't he take us?

30
00:03:25,728 --> 00:03:28,318
Because it was work and we couldn't go..

31
00:03:28,329 --> 00:03:30,530
But how about a "Good morning, Mommy".
Nice to see you.

32
00:03:30,531 --> 00:03:31,831
Good morning, Mommy.

33
00:03:31,931 --> 00:03:35,932
Mom, you gotta get dressed.
Sweety, we got plenty of time.

34
00:03:36,533 --> 00:03:38,150
We're gonna be late for school.

35
00:03:38,215 --> 00:03:41,216
Oh, no, we're not gonna be late for school..

36
00:03:54,322 --> 00:03:55,622
Bridgette, are you okay with this spelling words?

37
00:03:56,123 --> 00:03:56,923
Yes, Mom.

38
00:03:56,924 --> 00:03:58,840
Hey, hey, hey,
don't forget your lunchs.

39
00:04:02,027 --> 00:04:05,728
Come on, Megan.
I am.

40
00:05:35,854 --> 00:05:37,855
This isn't dirty.

41
00:06:08,124 --> 00:06:11,605
<i> Hey, girl! What's going on?
I can't believe it's Thursday already.</i>

42
00:06:11,606 --> 00:06:14,027
Tell me about it, I have no idea
where this we planned.

43
00:06:14,028 --> 00:06:15,488
God, I wish you were here..

44
00:06:15,489 --> 00:06:18,990
I'm having the hardest time trying
to pick up my dress for tonight.

45
00:06:19,191 --> 00:06:21,392
What about you guys?
You have any big plans for the weekend?

46
00:06:21,593 --> 00:06:23,693
What, besides jetting off to Acupulco?
No.

47
00:06:23,694 --> 00:06:26,935
Yeah, right.
Okay, I gotta go.

48
00:06:26,976 --> 00:06:29,217
I gotta figure out what
I'm doing with my life right now.

49
00:06:29,258 --> 00:06:31,159
Oh, yeah? What's his name?

50
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:34,040
His name, well, the name is
really bad, it's Harry..

51
00:06:34,062 --> 00:06:36,662
But you never know, he could be the one.

52
00:06:41,204 --> 00:06:45,086
<i> You have one new message.
First new message.</i>

53
00:06:45,307 --> 00:06:49,508
<i> Linda, listen,
I need to tell you something..</i>

54
00:06:50,709 --> 00:06:55,910
<i> I meant what I said in front
of that girls the other night and..</i>

55
00:06:56,271 --> 00:07:02,473
<i>I just...
I just want you to know that.</i>

56
00:07:02,954 --> 00:07:04,955
<i> And..
Please remember it.</i>

57
00:07:04,956 --> 00:07:08,357
<i> Oh, damn it, someone's calling..
Hold on.</i>

58
00:07:08,558 --> 00:07:10,259
<i> Is that you?</i>

59
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:13,360
<i> End of messages.</i>

60
00:07:16,362 --> 00:07:20,243
<i> If you leave a message,
I'll get back to you as soon as possible.</i>

61
00:07:20,284 --> 00:07:25,586
Hey, it's me, uh, I got your message,
I don't know when you left it, but um..

62
00:07:26,387 --> 00:07:30,788
Just, uh, call me when you get mine, okay?
Bye.

63
00:07:57,016 --> 00:07:59,537
Mrs. Hanson?
Yes.

64
00:07:59,558 --> 00:08:02,959
Linda Hanson?
Uh-huh.

65
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:05,761
I'm Sheriff Reilly.
Yes.

66
00:08:06,983 --> 00:08:12,284
I'm, uh, sorry to tell you this.
Your husband, Jim..

67
00:08:12,605 --> 00:08:16,406
Yeah.
Was in a car accident.

68
00:08:17,607 --> 00:08:20,008
He died on the scene.

69
00:08:29,832 --> 00:08:32,233
When?
Yesterday.

70
00:08:32,334 --> 00:08:35,955
No! No, it's impossible because I just, uh..

71
00:08:35,956 --> 00:08:40,257
I just heard his voice on
the answering machine, so..

72
00:08:40,858 --> 00:08:43,259
Well, I'm sorry, Ma'am.

73
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:48,601
We, uh, we couldn't get to you any sooner..

74
00:08:49,122 --> 00:08:51,723
The other driver was in a truck..

75
00:08:51,724 --> 00:08:56,725
Semi-- Pretty certain it was instantaneous..

76
00:08:56,726 --> 00:08:59,960
He was on the highway, mile mark for 220.

77
00:09:07,892 --> 00:09:12,693
Ma'am? Mrs. Hanson? Ma'am?

78
00:09:12,894 --> 00:09:16,895
Ma'am, is there anything that I can do?

79
00:09:16,896 --> 00:09:20,397
Can I call someone for you?

80
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:31,641
Let me leave you my card, okay?
If you have any questions, you just call me.

81
00:10:42,982 --> 00:10:45,783
What's wrong, Mommy?

82
00:10:50,745 --> 00:10:53,146
Mommy?

83
00:10:54,407 --> 00:10:57,208
What's wrong?

84
00:11:07,832 --> 00:11:11,033
It's about daddy.
Yeah?

85
00:11:10,274 --> 00:11:11,975
Yeah.

86
00:11:14,956 --> 00:11:18,057
He's had a very bad accident.

87
00:11:18,058 --> 00:11:20,259
What kind of accident?

88
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:24,821
When is he coming home?

89
00:11:26,422 --> 00:11:29,223
Is he okay?

90
00:11:30,304 --> 00:11:32,805
No baby, he's not.

91
00:11:53,492 --> 00:11:56,253
Well, I'm impressed.

92
00:11:56,274 --> 00:11:59,395
You guys got this far all by yourself?

93
00:11:59,436 --> 00:12:03,617
Yeah.
It's really amazing.

94
00:12:07,179 --> 00:12:13,380
Hey, it's Annie, leave a message after beep,
and I promise I'll get right back to you.

95
00:12:13,362 --> 00:12:16,562
Hey Annie, it's me..

96
00:12:17,564 --> 00:12:21,365
Could you please call me as soon
as you get this message? Thank you.

97
00:12:24,767 --> 00:12:29,568
Wow, you girls are doing so great.

98
00:12:29,849 --> 00:12:32,250
Daddy's better our puzzle.

99
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:35,052
He was going to help us.

100
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:04,801
I think I finally got them to sleep.

101
00:13:05,502 --> 00:13:07,203
Oh, I should say good night.

102
00:13:07,244 --> 00:13:10,645
No, don't do that, they just fell asleep, leave it.

103
00:13:12,446 --> 00:13:15,547
I was thinking about, um,
everything we need to get done.

104
00:13:16,748 --> 00:13:21,950
Tomorrow we should probably start
looking into funeral arrangements.

105
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:26,812
And then, um, you know, just see
where you are in terms of insurance.

106
00:13:26,833 --> 00:13:29,314
I'm not ready for that, Ma.

107
00:13:29,355 --> 00:13:31,756
Nobody is ready for any of this, dear.

108
00:13:32,457 --> 00:13:35,858
But you'll be surprise at how
strong you're gonna be..

109
00:13:35,859 --> 00:13:39,760
You know, when I lost your dad..
I can't stop thinking about our serving platter.

110
00:13:40,881 --> 00:13:41,741
What serving platter?

111
00:13:41,762 --> 00:13:46,564
You know, the big one on the top shove.
The one that his folks gave us.

112
00:13:47,765 --> 00:13:49,966
I can't reach that.

113
00:13:50,367 --> 00:13:53,068
Jim, Jim does that for me.

114
00:13:56,069 --> 00:14:01,071
Nobody expect you could get everything
done in the first few days, dear.

115
00:14:01,772 --> 00:14:06,513
I-- I'm pretty tired.
I'm gonna go lie down in the dent.

116
00:14:06,454 --> 00:14:10,475
I'll get some sheets out of the closet.

117
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:13,917
I'll be right up here if you need me, dear.

118
00:16:24,555 --> 00:16:26,156
Mom?

119
00:16:28,557 --> 00:16:30,458
Mom?

120
00:17:43,719 --> 00:17:45,620
Jim.

121
00:17:50,822 --> 00:17:53,223
What's wrong?

122
00:17:58,906 --> 00:18:03,507
I don't know.. I just-- I just had..

123
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:07,889
This is really strange just to..

124
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:10,031
What? What is it?

125
00:18:11,032 --> 00:18:17,834
Ok, I guess it's nothing,
it's nothing, it's nothing..

126
00:18:18,935 --> 00:18:22,116
Mom, we're late.
Three times and we'll get detention.

127
00:18:22,117 --> 00:18:25,418
You know how's a good way to start the day?
How about, "Good morning, Mommy!"

128
00:18:25,419 --> 00:18:27,820
Good morning.
Good morning.

129
00:18:28,221 --> 00:18:32,722
All right, I gotta get going,
it's a Monday morning meeting.

130
00:18:33,223 --> 00:18:35,724
Hugs for everybody.
All right, I gotta get going.

131
00:18:35,725 --> 00:18:38,526
I need to-- train this new assistant manager.

132
00:18:40,847 --> 00:18:43,848
Packed their lunches, ready to go.

133
00:18:44,049 --> 00:18:47,850
Are you ok to-- take them to school?

134
00:18:48,111 --> 00:18:49,812
Uh-hum.

135
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:52,914
Okay.

136
00:18:53,515 --> 00:18:58,216
You girls have fun at school now.
Ok, bye, daddy.

137
00:19:16,223 --> 00:19:17,524
Yes.

138
00:19:17,525 --> 00:19:20,926
Hey, you guys don't forget your lunch--

139
00:19:23,367 --> 00:19:27,068
Come on, Megan, get out of the car!
I'm coming!

140
00:19:51,976 --> 00:19:55,677
<i> You have no messages.</i>

141
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:13,884
Shit!

142
00:20:22,087 --> 00:20:26,288
That was quite a stop there.
Yeah, I was just, uh, I was totally..

143
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:29,710
Yes, I just-- I got com-

144
00:20:30,891 --> 00:20:35,132
Um, I just-
I was totally distracted.

145
00:20:35,253 --> 00:20:37,814
Let's just take it a little easy out there, huh?
Sure.

146
00:20:38,095 --> 00:20:40,696
We don't want anyone
getting hurt now, do we?

147
00:20:42,798 --> 00:20:44,898
I'm trying to figure out,
should I call him, I mean..

148
00:20:44,899 --> 00:20:46,800
I really feel like I wanna
call him but don't it sound like..

149
00:20:47,501 --> 00:20:48,681
I think that's breaking the rule.

150
00:20:48,722 --> 00:20:51,523
You think it's better, if I just wait?

151
00:20:52,524 --> 00:20:54,025
What?

152
00:20:54,926 --> 00:20:57,327
Did we talked yesterday?

153
00:20:57,328 --> 00:21:00,028
Yeah, we talk everyday.
No, I mean, um..

154
00:21:00,029 --> 00:21:05,831
Did I leave you a message?
I don't think so, why?

155
00:21:06,452 --> 00:21:09,253
Wait a minute, hang on,
I'm the one with the crisis, okay?

156
00:21:09,254 --> 00:21:12,055
Are you sure you're all right?
Yeah.

157
00:21:12,096 --> 00:21:14,496
Everything's cool with you and Jim?

158
00:21:15,718 --> 00:21:18,419
Yeah, everything is exactly the same.

159
00:23:13,552 --> 00:23:16,353
So, how was everybody's day?

160
00:23:18,434 --> 00:23:21,635
Mine was okay.
Kinda boring.

161
00:23:21,836 --> 00:23:25,537
Yeah, kinda boring.

162
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:28,939
Boring, huh?

163
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:42,161
Jim?

164
00:25:17,494 --> 00:25:20,494
Lithium.

165
00:25:45,022 --> 00:25:47,323
Here she is.
Hi, honey.

166
00:25:48,284 --> 00:25:49,445
Did you get some rest?

167
00:25:49,966 --> 00:25:51,126
What's going on?

168
00:25:51,167 --> 00:25:52,848
Hey, how are you feeling, but..

169
00:25:52,889 --> 00:25:54,209
Why don't you go upstairs
and let's get some clothes.

170
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:57,351
Are you going to go upstairs and get dressed?
Where are the girls?

171
00:25:57,352 --> 00:25:58,552
The girls are fine, dear.

172
00:25:58,553 --> 00:26:00,954
The girls are fine, honey.
Don't worry about the girls.

173
00:26:00,955 --> 00:26:02,055
This isn't right.

174
00:26:02,056 --> 00:26:02,857
What is it?

175
00:26:02,858 --> 00:26:05,458
No, everything's fine, you need to go
upstairs and get more sleep?

176
00:26:05,459 --> 00:26:09,721
No! No, I don't need any more sleep,
and I don't need to wake up either.

177
00:26:09,762 --> 00:26:12,962
Everything is going to be fine.
No mother, everything is not fine.

178
00:26:12,963 --> 00:26:18,165
Something is really, really wrong.
Ok, all right.

179
00:26:19,266 --> 00:26:21,167
He's not dead.

180
00:26:32,451 --> 00:26:34,151
Hi, baby!

181
00:26:34,172 --> 00:26:37,513
Hey! Hi!

182
00:26:37,554 --> 00:26:39,955
Sorry I wasn't awake
when you guys got up.

183
00:26:39,956 --> 00:26:45,557
Grandma said we had to let you sleep.
No, baby. You can always wake me up.

184
00:26:46,419 --> 00:26:48,619
It's just a dream.

185
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:50,761
Swing me.
Yeah.

186
00:26:50,762 --> 00:26:53,363
I think she's sad.

187
00:27:15,252 --> 00:27:18,533
Oh, my god! Oh, my god, baby!

188
00:27:18,554 --> 00:27:20,754
Baby, what happen to your face?

189
00:27:21,856 --> 00:27:25,097
Baby, talk to me, how did you get this cut?
Who did this to you?

190
00:27:25,098 --> 00:27:27,498
Did what?
The cuts! The cuts on your face!

191
00:27:27,499 --> 00:27:30,100
There is no cuts, Mommy.
What are you talking about?

192
00:27:30,821 --> 00:27:35,222
She's perfect,
like a beautiful princess.

193
00:27:40,765 --> 00:27:47,467
Oh, god, come here, just hold on to me,
It's going to be ok, it's going to be ok.

194
00:27:48,068 --> 00:27:50,789
Everything's going to be all right,
everything's going to be all right.

195
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:52,430
Mommy?
Yeah?

196
00:27:52,431 --> 00:27:56,132
I wonder what it like when daddy died?

197
00:27:56,913 --> 00:27:59,314
I don't know, baby.
I wasn't there.

198
00:27:59,815 --> 00:28:03,016
So, how did you know he died then?

199
00:28:35,746 --> 00:28:38,047
You all right?

200
00:28:38,348 --> 00:28:40,349
What if this is a mistake?

201
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:42,550
What do you mean, "a mistake"?

202
00:28:42,591 --> 00:28:45,292
People just don't day one day and
they're okay the next day, that's all.

203
00:28:45,333 --> 00:28:48,934
It's not a mistake.
Oh, Ok, Mum, did you see inside the cascade?

204
00:28:48,935 --> 00:28:50,336
No, I didn't see,
but it doesn't..

205
00:28:50,337 --> 00:28:53,137
Okay, Mum, something is seriously
fucked up with the situation.

206
00:28:53,138 --> 00:28:54,539
Linda, we need to go in the church now.
Come on, dear.

207
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:56,941
No, you need to take the kids inside.
Why don't you come inside with us..

208
00:28:56,942 --> 00:28:59,042
Just take the kids inside!
Go ahead, go ahead with the kids.

209
00:28:59,043 --> 00:29:01,344
Linda? Linda?

210
00:29:10,107 --> 00:29:11,307
Hello, Mrs. Hanson.

211
00:29:11,508 --> 00:29:14,229
Ow, I just want you to know
that everything's on schedule.

212
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:16,611
I need you to open the cascade.
No, no, no.

213
00:29:16,652 --> 00:29:19,453
I don't think that would be a very good idea.
Open up the cascade, god damn it!

214
00:29:19,454 --> 00:29:22,555
Open it up, open it up!

215
00:29:22,556 --> 00:29:25,656
Mrs. Hanson!
I beg you to let this go.

216
00:29:25,657 --> 00:29:27,078
Don't do this to me.
Mrs. Hanson.

217
00:29:28,721 --> 00:29:30,322
What kind of problem?

218
00:30:00,414 --> 00:30:05,215
Jim left this world,
a beloved person.

219
00:30:05,216 --> 00:30:08,117
His friends spoke about his kindness..

220
00:30:08,118 --> 00:30:17,621
His laugh, his graciousness, his helpfulness and
consideration to everyone around him

221
00:30:19,102 --> 00:30:23,904
But his greatest devotion
was to his family.

222
00:30:24,105 --> 00:30:30,226
His girls as he like to refer to them.
His lovely wife, Linda..

223
00:30:30,288 --> 00:30:33,388
The precious daughters, Megan and Bridgette...
Mom?

224
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:38,091
What?
Who's that?

225
00:30:38,292 --> 00:30:41,193
Who?
Her, that woman.

226
00:30:43,054 --> 00:30:45,155
I don't know, dear.

227
00:30:48,917 --> 00:30:52,118
Linda?
It's ok, It's ok.

228
00:31:10,987 --> 00:31:15,088
Wait! No, please wait, wait!

229
00:31:15,149 --> 00:31:17,050
I'm sorry.
Stop.

230
00:31:17,051 --> 00:31:18,531
How do you know my husband?

231
00:31:18,572 --> 00:31:20,173
I just thought that after we talked.

232
00:31:20,274 --> 00:31:22,154
We talked?
Yeah, yesterday.

233
00:31:22,195 --> 00:31:24,196
Yesterday?
You don't remember?

234
00:31:24,197 --> 00:31:27,298
No!
I've never met you before in my life!

235
00:31:27,299 --> 00:31:28,999
I'll just gonna go, Ok.
Please talk to me!

236
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:30,421
You have all my sympathies,
and your girls too.

237
00:31:30,422 --> 00:31:32,722
Who are you?
Please, don't..

238
00:32:08,234 --> 00:32:10,735
Dr. Norman Roth.

239
00:32:10,736 --> 00:32:12,736
Dr. Norman Roth!

240
00:32:13,838 --> 00:32:15,638
Mommy?

241
00:32:23,681 --> 00:32:26,442
Hey, why don't you girls go downstairs
and visit with Grandma and Aunt Annie.

242
00:32:26,483 --> 00:32:27,884
No!

243
00:32:28,285 --> 00:32:30,085
I'm sure it'll be fun.

244
00:32:30,086 --> 00:32:32,387
What are you looking for, Mommy?

245
00:32:32,388 --> 00:32:34,989
I'm in need of someone to talk to, baby.

246
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:36,870
Why don't you talk to us?

247
00:32:36,911 --> 00:32:40,572
Baby, I love talking to you, but this is--
this is grown up talking..

248
00:32:40,613 --> 00:32:44,414
Mommy needs some help, okay?
Come on, baby, please go downstairs.

249
00:32:45,115 --> 00:32:48,116
Thank you, baby. Thank you for being so good.

250
00:33:36,233 --> 00:33:39,034
You've reach the offices of Dr. Norman Roth..

251
00:33:39,075 --> 00:33:45,977
We are currently closed.
Our office hours are: Monday to Friday 9 am to 5.30 pm.

252
00:34:03,782 --> 00:34:10,184
Do you guys want some tea or coffee or anything,
can I get you something?

253
00:34:12,186 --> 00:34:14,947
Maybe we all just think about
getting the girls to sleep, huh?

254
00:34:14,968 --> 00:34:17,268
Oh, yes.
Been a long couple of days.

255
00:34:17,269 --> 00:34:19,970
Hum... Yes, it does.

256
00:34:20,271 --> 00:34:21,872
Allright, girls.

257
00:34:21,873 --> 00:34:25,174
Come on with Auntie Annie, we're gonna go upstairs
and we'll get your jamas on, okay?

258
00:34:25,195 --> 00:34:27,995
Can I read you a story?

259
00:34:27,996 --> 00:34:30,197
Yeah?

260
00:34:43,962 --> 00:34:46,002
Come in.

261
00:34:46,003 --> 00:34:48,504
Good evening, Mrs. Quinn.

262
00:34:49,005 --> 00:34:50,806
Hi there, Annie.

263
00:34:54,008 --> 00:34:58,209
Hello Linda.
Hello.

264
00:35:01,731 --> 00:35:04,632
I'm Dr. Roth, remember?

265
00:35:05,533 --> 00:35:08,634
No, I don't, I--

266
00:35:20,218 --> 00:35:21,218
Annie?

267
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:26,521
Okay, girls, let's go upstairs.
Mom, what's going on?

268
00:35:26,722 --> 00:35:31,543
Honey, please don't be angry,
please don't be angry with us.

269
00:35:31,544 --> 00:35:34,545
Wait a second, Annie!
Annie, what are you doing?

270
00:35:34,546 --> 00:35:39,047
Linda, your family is worried about you,
you family cares about you.

271
00:35:39,048 --> 00:35:41,249
What are you doing?

272
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:43,951
What are you doing? Annie? Annie?
What else could we do?

273
00:35:43,952 --> 00:35:44,352
What?

274
00:35:44,393 --> 00:35:46,774
Just tell us what happened to Bridgette's face!

275
00:35:46,775 --> 00:35:48,475
Mom, I don't know what happened to Bridgette..

276
00:35:48,476 --> 00:35:50,477
You see, that's what I mean!

277
00:35:50,478 --> 00:35:53,579
I would never do anything to hurt my child!

278
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:55,341
Get away from me!

279
00:36:10,951 --> 00:36:15,552
Mommy is sorry!
Mommy is very sorry!

280
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:38,380
Sir, sir, sir!

281
00:36:45,284 --> 00:36:48,825
Obviously she's never been corrected before..

282
00:36:48,866 --> 00:36:52,427
Her husband was in a fatal
car crash on Wednesday.

283
00:36:52,428 --> 00:36:54,749
I told her about it on Thursday.

284
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:56,750
Wou, wou, wou, wou,
hold on.

285
00:36:57,351 --> 00:36:59,352
Wednesday?

286
00:37:00,053 --> 00:37:04,954
That's strange, she showed up
in my office on Tuesday.

287
00:37:05,356 --> 00:37:09,757
Claiming he was already dead or..
He's going to be..

288
00:37:09,758 --> 00:37:11,578
She said he was going to die, before the accident?

289
00:37:11,579 --> 00:37:12,880
Yeah.

290
00:37:14,061 --> 00:37:16,962
You sure it was an accident?

291
00:37:36,388 --> 00:37:38,089
Hello, Linda.

292
00:37:39,610 --> 00:37:42,311
Please don't do this,
I just wanna go home to my girls.

293
00:37:42,312 --> 00:37:44,112
Please don't do this.

294
00:37:44,113 --> 00:37:46,434
Please, Sir.
Just let me go home to my girls.

295
00:37:46,475 --> 00:37:48,176
We'll have time to talk about that tomorrow.

296
00:38:04,682 --> 00:38:09,283
Everything's going to be just fine.

297
00:39:48,852 --> 00:39:50,453
Jim?

298
00:39:53,595 --> 00:39:55,295
What?

299
00:40:02,898 --> 00:40:05,519
You're ok?
Come on, Linda. You're going to get yourself soaked.

300
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:08,381
Just give me a minute,
just one moment.

301
00:40:10,382 --> 00:40:14,284
I can hear your heart beating
and it feel so good.

302
00:40:17,285 --> 00:40:19,626
Hey, hey, hey,
hold on.

303
00:40:19,627 --> 00:40:23,228
Everything's going to be fine.
Come on.

304
00:40:23,429 --> 00:40:25,630
You promise?
I promise.

305
00:40:29,152 --> 00:40:32,253
What is it, honey?
Tell me what's going on.

306
00:40:32,274 --> 00:40:35,475
I don't really know how to explain it.

307
00:41:00,563 --> 00:41:03,663
I gotta get going, I gotta go to work.
Just give me a minute, just one more minute.

308
00:41:29,934 --> 00:41:32,435
Girls?

309
00:41:33,936 --> 00:41:36,237
Good morning, Mommy.
Morning.

310
00:41:36,238 --> 00:41:37,938
Good morning, Mommy.

311
00:41:48,284 --> 00:41:53,185
Oh.. Oh, you are so beautiful,
did you know?

312
00:41:53,868 --> 00:41:56,268
Beautiful, you are both beautiful.

313
00:42:09,533 --> 00:42:11,974
I need for you to be very,
very careful today, okay?

314
00:42:12,015 --> 00:42:14,215
No playing with scissors,
I don't want you to running around.

315
00:42:14,316 --> 00:42:15,517
Ma'am, you're holding up the line.

316
00:42:15,717 --> 00:42:17,197
Sit quite, promise me.
Ma'am!

317
00:42:17,238 --> 00:42:17,938
Just give me a second.

318
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:21,340
Just promise me, you promise?
I promise.

319
00:42:21,341 --> 00:42:23,342
Baby, you are going to promise me too, okay?
All right.

320
00:42:23,343 --> 00:42:26,544
Ok, here you go, you guys be good.

321
00:42:28,745 --> 00:42:31,246
Ma'am, come on, please.

322
00:44:15,539 --> 00:44:17,740
Mrs. Stevenson?
Steven...

323
00:44:19,542 --> 00:44:21,942
Can I help you?
I'm Linda Hanson.

324
00:44:23,044 --> 00:44:26,845
Hello, Linda. I'm Dr. Roth.

325
00:44:28,326 --> 00:44:30,127
Do you know me?

326
00:44:30,828 --> 00:44:32,528
Should I?

327
00:44:33,429 --> 00:44:37,931
I wake up, and his dead,
I wake up, and his alive.

328
00:44:37,932 --> 00:44:41,493
Different things around me
all the time that I can't explain..

329
00:44:41,514 --> 00:44:43,914
Things that I've done.

330
00:44:43,915 --> 00:44:48,537
People talking to me.
People who know me, but I have never met.

331
00:44:48,558 --> 00:44:50,458
People like me?
Yes.

332
00:44:50,459 --> 00:44:53,860
Seems a little complicated.
Tell me about it.

333
00:44:56,162 --> 00:44:59,063
What about the Lithium bottle?

334
00:44:59,064 --> 00:45:03,345
I don't know, it's, it's,
I don't know, I misplaced it somewhere.

335
00:45:03,346 --> 00:45:06,087
Look! I can't explain it,
but I tought if somebody was trying to..

336
00:45:06,128 --> 00:45:08,208
Trying to, drug you?
Uhum.

337
00:45:08,209 --> 00:45:10,510
Why and who?
I don't know, you tell me.

338
00:45:10,551 --> 00:45:13,452
I didn't prescribe it.
But your name was on the bottle.

339
00:45:13,453 --> 00:45:15,053
Why do you think I came here?

340
00:45:15,154 --> 00:45:16,715
To get some help.

341
00:45:16,756 --> 00:45:20,757
Obviously, you're dealing
with some inconsistencies.

342
00:45:21,179 --> 00:45:23,360
I wake up every morning to find
my husband has died again..

343
00:45:23,401 --> 00:45:26,702
I think that goes just
a little beyond inconsistent.

344
00:45:28,303 --> 00:45:29,703
How do you feel..

345
00:45:31,705 --> 00:45:35,006
During the times of his dead?

346
00:45:36,307 --> 00:45:36,827
What?

347
00:45:36,868 --> 00:45:40,669
I mean, what kind of
emotions run trough you?

348
00:45:40,670 --> 00:45:44,771
Is it sorrow, resentment, relief?

349
00:45:44,772 --> 00:45:45,433
What are you saying?

350
00:45:45,434 --> 00:45:49,215
That's a pretty common day dream
to imagine people being death.

351
00:45:49,656 --> 00:45:52,397
I'm not day-dreaming, okay?
I wake up and he is dead.

352
00:45:52,558 --> 00:45:54,358
Except for today.

353
00:45:54,919 --> 00:45:59,000
Do you have any history of
mental illness in your family?

354
00:45:58,481 --> 00:45:59,482
No.

355
00:45:59,483 --> 00:46:05,184
What about yourself,
any episodes of psychosis? Memory lost?

356
00:46:05,185 --> 00:46:06,646
Judgment lapses?

357
00:46:06,647 --> 00:46:09,600
I don't want him dead!
It was a car accident.

358
00:46:09,749 --> 00:46:13,049
Well, it's not a crime imagining it.
I'm not imagining it.

359
00:46:13,050 --> 00:46:14,551
He's dead!

360
00:46:22,754 --> 00:46:26,255
Well, it is a little odd..

361
00:46:26,256 --> 00:46:28,737
But the prescription was far that lift you..

362
00:46:28,738 --> 00:46:29,538
Why?

363
00:46:29,539 --> 00:46:34,240
Because, that's probably the
best thing for you right now.

364
00:46:34,942 --> 00:46:37,242
It'll help you cope.

365
00:46:38,543 --> 00:46:43,945
Do you think you can make
it in to see me here tomorrow?

366
00:47:01,571 --> 00:47:03,972
Hey, look who's here!
Hey, Bob. Is Jim here?

367
00:47:04,013 --> 00:47:06,414
Yeah, how come you don't
come by to anymore?

368
00:47:10,276 --> 00:47:12,236
Hi.
I need to talk to you.

369
00:47:12,277 --> 00:47:15,678
What is it?
What's going on?

370
00:47:15,679 --> 00:47:18,280
I know I've been acting strange,
but something wrong..

371
00:47:18,281 --> 00:47:19,961
There's something very wrong.
What is it? The girls?

372
00:47:19,962 --> 00:47:22,563
No, no, no, they're fine,
at least, for now.

373
00:47:22,964 --> 00:47:24,425
Can we just go somewhere?

374
00:47:24,466 --> 00:47:26,106
Just us, let's just take the girls.. Just go..

375
00:47:26,147 --> 00:47:28,148
I can't go anywhere,
I have to work.

376
00:47:28,149 --> 00:47:30,109
Please, I really need you, can we just.

377
00:47:30,150 --> 00:47:32,651
I have to go to the sales meeting.

378
00:47:33,352 --> 00:47:36,553
Excuse me. Jim, we're waiting for you.

379
00:47:40,355 --> 00:47:43,236
I'm sorry. Who are you?

380
00:47:43,237 --> 00:47:45,998
I'm Claire Francis,
you must be Jim's wife.

381
00:47:45,999 --> 00:47:47,799
Yeah, Linda.

382
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:51,501
I've seen your pictures,
it's nice to meet you.

383
00:47:53,283 --> 00:47:56,683
Claire is our new assistant manager.

384
00:47:58,005 --> 00:48:01,806
Your husband has been really
helpful for the last few weeks.

385
00:48:02,007 --> 00:48:04,208
Guys, we're starting.

386
00:48:05,089 --> 00:48:06,689
Excuse me.

387
00:48:13,392 --> 00:48:16,393
We can talk about this later.

388
00:49:42,638 --> 00:49:43,639
Girls?

389
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:47,641
Hurry, the laundry is outside, grab it!
Hurry!

390
00:49:50,782 --> 00:49:54,444
I'll meet you guys outside, okay?

391
00:49:56,265 --> 00:50:00,366
Bridgette, no, Bridgette!
Bridgette, no!

392
00:50:09,470 --> 00:50:12,170
Baby, I'm right here,
I'm right here.

393
00:50:12,452 --> 00:50:14,552
Megan, go get me some towels, please.

394
00:50:15,454 --> 00:50:17,954
Mommy?
I got you.

395
00:50:18,856 --> 00:50:21,056
It's okay, it's okay.

396
00:50:22,457 --> 00:50:24,258
It's okay, baby.

397
00:50:24,739 --> 00:50:27,440
She's still bleeding, Mommy.

398
00:50:29,141 --> 00:50:30,862
Somebody, somebody, please!

399
00:50:30,863 --> 00:50:32,263
I'm Dr. Norman, can you tell me what happened?

400
00:50:32,264 --> 00:50:33,645
Yes, she went through the glass door.

401
00:50:33,666 --> 00:50:35,466
Any allergies that should we know about?

402
00:50:35,567 --> 00:50:38,068
Cordim, cordim.
Okay, just put her in 14 please.

403
00:50:38,069 --> 00:50:40,670
Ma'am, I'm going to need you to wait out here.
No, ma'am, we'll take care of her..

404
00:50:40,671 --> 00:50:43,571
Everything is going to be fine.
It's going to be okay, baby.

405
00:50:44,673 --> 00:50:45,773
Is she okay?

406
00:50:45,774 --> 00:50:49,375
Yeah, they just took her in.
You all right?

407
00:50:49,376 --> 00:50:50,676
Yes.

408
00:50:51,678 --> 00:50:57,779
She was running out to get the laundry,
and she was, she just went through the glass window.

409
00:51:10,486 --> 00:51:12,587
What are you doing, Mommy?

410
00:51:12,828 --> 00:51:16,029
We are going to forget about Mary's for a while.

411
00:51:16,630 --> 00:51:18,410
Do you feel any better?

412
00:51:18,411 --> 00:51:20,792
Does she going to have that
ugly scars forever?

413
00:51:20,793 --> 00:51:22,694
I don't want any talk about scars.

414
00:51:28,298 --> 00:51:30,779
I don't care what anyone tells you, okay?

415
00:51:30,820 --> 00:51:32,320
Do you understand?

416
00:51:33,422 --> 00:51:35,522
Because you are beautiful.

417
00:51:35,923 --> 00:51:38,524
Like a princess?

418
00:51:40,926 --> 00:51:44,527
Yeah, like a princess.

419
00:51:44,728 --> 00:51:47,028
My two princesses.

420
00:52:15,437 --> 00:52:18,358
I tought you're gonna put up stickers?

421
00:52:18,399 --> 00:52:20,100
I did.

422
00:52:22,601 --> 00:52:26,302
I don't know, maybe,
maybe I thought I did.

423
00:52:28,704 --> 00:52:30,225
Christ, Linda.

424
00:52:30,226 --> 00:52:33,226
What? Are you blaming me for this now?

425
00:52:34,028 --> 00:52:36,928
I've asked your mother to
come and stay while I'm gone.

426
00:52:38,130 --> 00:52:39,610
What? Why?

427
00:52:39,611 --> 00:52:41,512
Just to help, you know?
I don't need any help.

428
00:52:41,513 --> 00:52:43,613
Help take care of the kids.
I don't need any help.

429
00:52:43,614 --> 00:52:45,715
Look, you can take a break.

430
00:52:45,716 --> 00:52:47,656
You know,
some time for yourself.

431
00:52:47,697 --> 00:52:51,699
For what? Time for myself for what?
So I could stop acting like a crazy person?

432
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:55,000
What are you talking about, I never said..
You are not separating me from my kids.

433
00:52:55,001 --> 00:52:57,202
I'm a good Mom.

434
00:54:22,628 --> 00:54:24,489
Ok. Uhm.

435
00:54:24,530 --> 00:54:27,631
Thursday. I discover that Jim died.

436
00:54:32,033 --> 00:54:37,534
Monday. Jim alive.

437
00:54:38,836 --> 00:54:42,737
Funeral's on.. Saturday!

438
00:54:46,039 --> 00:54:48,039
What else..

439
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:52,341
Lithium, it's on Saturday.

440
00:54:58,904 --> 00:55:00,605
Except for today.

441
00:55:01,306 --> 00:55:04,407
Meet Dr. Roth on Tuesday.

442
00:55:07,710 --> 00:55:10,911
Saturday... Dr. Roth.

443
00:55:10,952 --> 00:55:12,452
Bridgette's cut happened on..

444
00:55:14,074 --> 00:55:15,774
Bridgette! Bridgette!

445
00:55:16,075 --> 00:55:16,775
Mommy?

446
00:55:16,776 --> 00:55:18,197
Tuesday

447
00:55:18,638 --> 00:55:22,239
.. still open in Wednesday.. Wednesday..

448
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:26,441
<i>You have one new message.</i>

449
00:55:26,742 --> 00:55:30,543
When?
Yesterday.

450
00:55:31,424 --> 00:55:33,025
Oh, God.

451
00:55:35,026 --> 00:55:41,328
Jim dies on Wednesday.

452
00:55:41,369 --> 00:55:43,270
What are you doing?

453
00:55:50,293 --> 00:55:52,393
Jim, don't go on this trip, please.

454
00:55:52,394 --> 00:55:55,995
I have to, I've waited all the
year for this interview.

455
00:55:55,996 --> 00:55:58,597
Besides, it could be good for us,
you know.

456
00:55:58,778 --> 00:56:00,859
Take a break from each other.

457
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:04,401
Well, it might be a bigger break
than need broken for.

458
00:56:05,102 --> 00:56:07,302
What if something happens to you?

459
00:56:08,004 --> 00:56:10,705
Something could happen to me
on my way home from work.

460
00:56:10,706 --> 00:56:12,806
Should I stop working?
You want me to beg?

461
00:56:12,807 --> 00:56:16,108
I will beg, please, just don't go,
you have a children and you have a family.

462
00:56:16,109 --> 00:56:17,850
Why are you saying that?
You think I've forgotten that?

463
00:56:17,891 --> 00:56:19,391
No, I haven't..
Because I haven't!

464
00:56:19,392 --> 00:56:20,592
I realised that,
I didn't say that you forgot..

465
00:56:20,693 --> 00:56:22,094
All right, good.
Just listen to me.

466
00:56:26,218 --> 00:56:28,819
Just do me one favor..

467
00:56:29,420 --> 00:56:32,821
If tomorrow is Wednesday,
just please, wake me up before you leave?

468
00:56:32,822 --> 00:56:34,922
If tomorrow is Wednesday?
Just... I know it sounds crazy.

469
00:56:34,923 --> 00:56:37,524
Just, please, wake me up, okay?

470
00:56:39,026 --> 00:56:41,027
Promise me!

471
00:56:42,928 --> 00:56:46,429
I promise.
Good.

472
00:56:47,531 --> 00:56:49,531
Okay.

473
00:57:23,862 --> 00:57:26,963
Oh, that guest bed is just awful.

474
00:57:26,964 --> 00:57:28,564
Mom.

475
00:57:28,665 --> 00:57:31,386
That's why you stayed over..
You forget I was here?

476
00:57:31,387 --> 00:57:34,688
No, no, no, I remember,
I remember now..

477
00:57:34,689 --> 00:57:37,790
Friday, friday, friday morning..
Friday morning!

478
00:57:47,995 --> 00:57:51,556
This is Sunday and there's friday,
I don't remember. Shit! Shit!

479
00:57:51,557 --> 00:57:52,957
Are you all right?
Shit.

480
00:57:52,958 --> 00:57:57,659
She appears, Claire Francis..
Miss Claire, Miss Claire.

481
00:57:58,621 --> 00:57:59,161
We talked?

482
00:57:59,142 --> 00:58:01,743
We had yesterday,
you don't remember?

483
00:58:13,028 --> 00:58:15,329
Mom, I have to go.
What?

484
00:58:15,330 --> 00:58:18,330
You need to be with the girls,
you had the shock of your life yesterday.

485
00:58:18,331 --> 00:58:20,332
Tell me about it.

486
00:58:49,821 --> 00:58:56,023
Is there something we should
be talking about?

487
00:58:56,424 --> 00:58:59,225
Something involving my husband?

488
00:59:04,227 --> 00:59:08,928
I've told you.

489
00:59:09,129 --> 00:59:11,430
I think you just did.

490
00:59:14,232 --> 00:59:16,032
He was going to cheat on me.

491
00:59:17,334 --> 00:59:18,934
What?

492
00:59:20,176 --> 00:59:23,717
Wait a minute, how did you know,
how did you find out?

493
00:59:23,778 --> 00:59:25,318
I talked to her,
she told me everything.

494
00:59:25,779 --> 00:59:27,980
When?
Today.

495
00:59:28,481 --> 00:59:32,082
Oh, I'm sorry,
are you still in shock?

496
00:59:32,083 --> 00:59:33,383
No.

497
00:59:37,987 --> 00:59:43,288
The whole thing is bad, the accident,
the other woman, it's a mess..

498
00:59:43,329 --> 00:59:45,530
I don't know if it's so bad.

499
00:59:47,431 --> 00:59:49,732
Maybe it's supposed to happen.

500
00:59:49,833 --> 00:59:52,134
What do you mean?

501
00:59:53,935 --> 00:59:56,736
Even though he didn't do anything yet..

502
00:59:56,737 --> 01:00:00,638
The damage that it would
have cost us, the girls..

503
01:00:02,039 --> 01:00:05,740
Maybe it was enough what he was going to..

504
01:00:06,042 --> 01:00:08,542
Are you listening to
what you are saying?

505
01:00:08,543 --> 01:00:10,344
We were roommates, Annie.

506
01:00:10,845 --> 01:00:13,586
We were roommates,
two girls...

507
01:00:13,627 --> 01:00:16,727
And my roommate was a liar.

508
01:00:37,295 --> 01:00:41,577
Well, as far as you mortgage, and your
daughter's education should all be taken care of..

509
01:00:49,881 --> 01:00:51,381
You know, Linda.

510
01:00:52,082 --> 01:00:53,783
I have to tell you,
the timing of all this.

511
01:00:53,824 --> 01:00:55,825
'Timing'?
What do you mean, 'timing'?

512
01:00:56,626 --> 01:00:59,547
Jim stopped and he see me on
Wednesday morning, right before..

513
01:00:59,608 --> 01:01:01,608
Wednesday?
Yes.

514
01:01:01,729 --> 01:01:05,430
And he seemed very anxious,
like he wasn't quite sure of things..

515
01:01:05,431 --> 01:01:09,332
And he kept talking about you,
and the girls, and he said that..

516
01:01:09,333 --> 01:01:13,134
No matter what happen,
he wanted to make sure you're all okay..

517
01:01:13,135 --> 01:01:16,036
And then he tripled his death benefit.

518
01:01:16,177 --> 01:01:17,958
I mean, it's on no problem.

519
01:01:17,959 --> 01:01:20,359
The police reports all confirm
that it was an accident, so..

520
01:01:20,360 --> 01:01:25,262
I'll just get this clear to the main office.
And, um, I should have a check for you very soon.

521
01:01:48,969 --> 01:01:51,970
Nice view, huh?

522
01:01:53,712 --> 01:01:55,612
Yes, very.

523
01:01:56,013 --> 01:01:57,914
You have a family?

524
01:02:01,676 --> 01:02:05,637
I have two daughters, but, um..

525
01:02:05,938 --> 01:02:10,039
It's no big deal,
happens to a lot of people.

526
01:02:10,180 --> 01:02:14,142
They drive by here, just like you did,
to see the houses by this beautiful lake..

527
01:02:14,183 --> 01:02:17,183
Suddenly said to themselves:
What a great place to start over.

528
01:02:19,385 --> 01:02:22,086
I moved here after my divorce.

529
01:02:23,087 --> 01:02:26,688
Really?
Yeah, it's great.

530
01:02:27,989 --> 01:02:30,890
It's like a whole new life.

531
01:02:43,917 --> 01:02:47,318
Hello, I'm Dorothy Quinn.

532
01:02:47,839 --> 01:02:49,539
I know.

533
01:02:50,741 --> 01:02:53,241
Got it.

534
01:03:00,384 --> 01:03:03,085
Hi, honey.
Hi, Mom.

535
01:03:10,208 --> 01:03:14,009
One for you.
Cool!

536
01:03:14,110 --> 01:03:17,311
Thank you, Mommy.
You're welcome.

537
01:03:17,832 --> 01:03:20,133
You know how much
I love you, right?

538
01:03:31,817 --> 01:03:34,118
Linda?
Yeah.

539
01:03:35,519 --> 01:03:38,620
I don't want to upset you.
What is it, Mom?

540
01:03:38,621 --> 01:03:40,522
I know this is very difficult, but...

541
01:03:40,723 --> 01:03:43,424
I really do think we need to drive
out to the funeral home, dear.

542
01:03:43,925 --> 01:03:47,226
I'll go with you.
Oh, it's done.

543
01:03:47,227 --> 01:03:51,228
What?
I already made all the arrangements.

544
01:03:51,829 --> 01:03:53,429
Oh.

545
01:03:54,630 --> 01:03:57,030
When are you thinking
of having this..

546
01:03:57,031 --> 01:04:00,632
The funeral is tomorrow, till Saturday.

547
01:04:00,633 --> 01:04:02,454
Saturday?
Saturday.

548
01:04:02,455 --> 01:04:06,856
That soon?
Yes, that soon.

549
01:04:28,543 --> 01:04:31,144
You okay, Hon?

550
01:04:34,326 --> 01:04:35,726
Hey, Mom.

551
01:04:37,027 --> 01:04:39,528
Uhum?

552
01:04:39,669 --> 01:04:43,170
If I let Jim die..

553
01:04:43,992 --> 01:04:46,492
Is that the same thing as killing him?

554
01:04:50,694 --> 01:04:53,295
Honey, Jim's already dead.

555
01:05:01,298 --> 01:05:03,399
Good night, dear.

556
01:06:25,004 --> 01:06:31,105
Hot Sunday.
All day long.

557
01:06:34,047 --> 01:06:35,968
Hey, you want to go take
the girls out for a while?

558
01:06:35,989 --> 01:06:38,890
You know, you guys should
spend some time together.

559
01:06:39,491 --> 01:06:41,592
You can have some fun.

560
01:06:41,593 --> 01:06:45,694
Yes, okay.
That's a good idea.

561
01:06:48,295 --> 01:06:50,896
You girls want daddy to make you
some pancakes for breakfast?

562
01:06:50,897 --> 01:06:52,597
Yeah!

563
01:07:35,311 --> 01:07:36,511
Hello, Father.

564
01:07:39,413 --> 01:07:40,713
Linda..

565
01:07:41,414 --> 01:07:43,715
It's been a long time.

566
01:07:48,978 --> 01:07:52,078
I'm scared, Father.

567
01:08:04,605 --> 01:08:08,406
1632, a Dutch trading company
move off the coast of Carolina..

568
01:08:10,407 --> 01:08:11,748
A hysterical woman claimed..

569
01:08:11,889 --> 01:08:16,390
To have walked through the aftermath
of a terrible hurricane that haven't happen yet.

570
01:08:16,770 --> 01:08:18,571
So, what happened?

571
01:08:18,572 --> 01:08:21,473
They hung her for being a witch.

572
01:08:21,474 --> 01:08:26,875
Two days later, the entire town was
wiped out by a force of hurricane.

573
01:08:26,876 --> 01:08:28,477
It's awful.

574
01:08:28,818 --> 01:08:31,618
Let's get ahead to the 20th century.

575
01:08:31,619 --> 01:08:34,900
Boston, 1918.

576
01:08:34,901 --> 01:08:37,502
At the height of the influence of epidermic.

577
01:08:37,503 --> 01:08:40,304
A father told a friend he's been to the future..

578
01:08:40,305 --> 01:08:43,406
He seen a grave of a two small children.

579
01:08:46,849 --> 01:08:48,549
Oh, my God.

580
01:08:48,550 --> 01:08:51,951
The autopsy showed that the
children were never infected.

581
01:08:52,152 --> 01:08:55,353
He shot himself a week later.

582
01:08:56,754 --> 01:08:59,435
Who are these people,
why did it happened?

583
01:08:59,436 --> 01:09:01,437
You see..

584
01:09:01,438 --> 01:09:05,139
History's full of unexplained phenomena..

585
01:09:05,140 --> 01:09:06,980
Nobody knows why.

586
01:09:07,021 --> 01:09:12,423
Some people tought, they suffered from
what the ancients called..

587
01:09:12,424 --> 01:09:16,065
"Blasphomare Absence Fudas"

588
01:09:16,086 --> 01:09:19,147
The dangers of the fatales.

589
01:09:19,188 --> 01:09:20,388
The fatales?

590
01:09:24,691 --> 01:09:27,232
Even spritiual.

591
01:09:27,473 --> 01:09:30,974
People who've lost their belief..

592
01:09:31,175 --> 01:09:33,636
They are like empty vessels.

593
01:09:33,677 --> 01:09:38,618
They are more susceptible of having their life
taken over by a force whose bigger than themselves.

594
01:09:38,859 --> 01:09:40,860
It's almost like a curse.

595
01:09:40,861 --> 01:09:42,862
Or a miracle.

596
01:09:43,843 --> 01:09:46,643
Yeah, but I don't believe in miracles.

597
01:09:46,765 --> 01:09:50,065
Everyday, we're alive can be a miracle.

598
01:09:50,767 --> 01:09:54,968
I doesn't feel that right, not for me.

599
01:09:56,389 --> 01:09:57,590
Father..

600
01:09:58,791 --> 01:10:01,692
Something bad is going to happen.

601
01:10:01,693 --> 01:10:05,334
I need your help, I need your direction..

602
01:10:05,375 --> 01:10:07,275
I need faith.

603
01:10:07,996 --> 01:10:13,518
Faith, it's just believing something behind yourself..

604
01:10:13,539 --> 01:10:18,340
Something you can't feel, or smell, or touch..

605
01:10:18,341 --> 01:10:21,842
Like hope.. Or love..

606
01:10:24,004 --> 01:10:27,305
I believe I've let that all go.

607
01:10:28,306 --> 01:10:31,667
Maybe you should try and get it back again, huh?

608
01:10:31,668 --> 01:10:33,269
But if it's too late?

609
01:10:33,270 --> 01:10:38,171
It's never too late to realise
what's important in your life..

610
01:10:38,172 --> 01:10:40,273
To fight for it.

611
01:10:41,480 --> 01:10:43,235
I don't know what to fight for.

612
01:11:56,897 --> 01:12:02,499
He was on the highway, mile mark for 220.

613
01:12:05,480 --> 01:12:08,281
Mrs. Hanson?

614
01:12:09,343 --> 01:12:11,443
Ma'am?

615
01:12:12,144 --> 01:12:13,845
Who are these people?
Why did it happened?

616
01:12:13,946 --> 01:12:15,646
History's full of unexplained phenomena.

617
01:12:15,747 --> 01:12:18,008
Bridgette, no, Bridgette!
Nobody knows why.

618
01:12:18,029 --> 01:12:20,230
Open it up!
Open it up! No!

619
01:12:20,231 --> 01:12:23,532
Obviously, you're dealing
with some inconsistencies.

620
01:12:25,034 --> 01:12:26,534
Dangers of the fatales.

621
01:12:26,635 --> 01:12:27,456
I'm Claire Francis...

622
01:12:27,497 --> 01:12:30,198
Your husband has been really
helpful for the last few days.

623
01:12:31,599 --> 01:12:35,200
How do you feel during
the times of his dead?

624
01:12:35,201 --> 01:12:36,801
We don't want anyone
getting hurt, do we?

625
01:12:36,822 --> 01:12:39,203
If I let Jim die..
It's never too late..

626
01:12:39,164 --> 01:12:41,265
Is that the same thing as killing him?

627
01:12:41,266 --> 01:12:44,667
Inconsistencies.
.. the same thing as killing him.

628
01:13:16,057 --> 01:13:21,259
You guys have a good time?
Yeah, yeah, we got a great time.

629
01:13:23,160 --> 01:13:25,161
Good.

630
01:13:50,169 --> 01:13:52,670
Let me help you with that.

631
01:13:54,771 --> 01:13:57,672
Smell good.

632
01:14:13,338 --> 01:14:15,438
Oh, good girls.

633
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:19,440
Nite.

634
01:14:19,541 --> 01:14:21,342
Good night.
Good night.

635
01:14:24,845 --> 01:14:27,746
Hey, why don't you girls go give your
dad another hug and say thanks.

636
01:14:27,807 --> 01:14:29,707
Okay, okay.

637
01:14:31,509 --> 01:14:33,109
What's this all about?

638
01:14:33,110 --> 01:14:35,271
Momma said to give you extra hugs.

639
01:14:35,272 --> 01:14:39,473
Extra hugs?
Extra hugs and extra kisses.

640
01:14:41,474 --> 01:14:43,275
Now off to bed,
go brush your teeth.

641
01:14:43,376 --> 01:14:46,117
Hey, girls. Why don't you tell
daddy how much you love him.

642
01:14:46,118 --> 01:14:47,818
Love you, daddy!
Me too!

643
01:14:47,919 --> 01:14:50,220
Well, thank you, ladies.

644
01:14:52,621 --> 01:14:54,722
Aren't you going to tell them?

645
01:14:54,723 --> 01:14:58,224
Tell them what?
That you love them.

646
01:14:59,165 --> 01:15:01,366
You do love them, don't you?

647
01:15:02,667 --> 01:15:04,368
Of course I do.

648
01:15:05,069 --> 01:15:06,970
Then tell them.

649
01:15:10,131 --> 01:15:12,532
You girls know how
much I love you, right?

650
01:15:12,633 --> 01:15:15,034
Huh? Right?

651
01:15:15,135 --> 01:15:19,036
I love you more than anything
in the whole wide world.

652
01:15:20,537 --> 01:15:23,338
Mom too.

653
01:15:23,559 --> 01:15:25,760
More than anything?

654
01:15:31,102 --> 01:15:33,603
I do love your Momma..

655
01:15:34,304 --> 01:15:36,605
I love her very much.

656
01:15:58,552 --> 01:16:00,252
Linda!

657
01:16:09,516 --> 01:16:12,117
What are you doing out here?

658
01:16:17,019 --> 01:16:19,120
Honey, let's go back inside.

659
01:16:19,921 --> 01:16:22,422
How did we get here, Jim?

660
01:16:23,023 --> 01:16:24,823
I miss you.

661
01:16:25,325 --> 01:16:26,825
I miss us.

662
01:16:26,826 --> 01:16:28,567
It's still an us, it's just different now,
that's all.

663
01:16:28,568 --> 01:16:30,888
Why? Why is it different?
I don't know why!

664
01:16:31,129 --> 01:16:34,430
What did you expect this to be like?
Just the way we used to be.

665
01:16:36,032 --> 01:16:40,333
Linda, look at us. We're married, we got
a house, a mortgage, two kids.

666
01:16:40,334 --> 01:16:43,115
Why do we have to talk about this now?
Why can't we just go inside?

667
01:16:43,136 --> 01:16:46,336
Because we're running out of time!

668
01:16:55,020 --> 01:16:57,821
Watch out!

669
01:18:34,349 --> 01:18:36,549
I'm sorry.

670
01:18:38,671 --> 01:18:40,671
I'm so sorry.

671
01:19:48,114 --> 01:19:51,015
You wanna tell me something?

672
01:19:59,519 --> 01:20:02,920
I had a dream you're going to die.

673
01:20:06,242 --> 01:20:08,342
That was only a dream.

674
01:20:09,523 --> 01:20:12,724
Everything's going to be fine.

675
01:20:28,450 --> 01:20:31,951
Hello.
Annie, Annie what day is it today?

676
01:20:31,952 --> 01:20:35,453
It's, um, it's Wednesday.
What's the matter?

677
01:20:36,854 --> 01:20:41,956
Girls? Girls? Jim? Jim?!

678
01:20:43,437 --> 01:20:46,018
Jim?
Oh, shit.

679
01:20:48,340 --> 01:20:51,941
I took the girls to school,
I'll be back tomorrow.

680
01:20:55,943 --> 01:21:00,004
<i> Hi, this is Jim Hanson,
I can't get your call right now, but..</i>

681
01:21:00,005 --> 01:21:02,806
<i> if you leave a message,
I'll get back to you as soon as possible.</i>

682
01:21:03,107 --> 01:21:05,207
<i> Thanks for calling.</i>

683
01:21:17,912 --> 01:21:22,713
I should be able to take care
of this right away, no problem.

684
01:21:23,914 --> 01:21:25,615
Thanks, Doug.

685
01:22:03,648 --> 01:22:04,948
<i> I just got to the room.</i>

686
01:22:04,949 --> 01:22:07,050
It's really nice.

687
01:22:08,451 --> 01:22:11,952
I can't wait for you to get here.

688
01:22:12,553 --> 01:22:15,154
Jim? Something wrong?

689
01:22:15,555 --> 01:22:16,955
Yeah..

690
01:22:17,757 --> 01:22:22,058
Sorry, I can't.. I can't do this..

691
01:22:24,159 --> 01:22:26,360
Do what? The interview?

692
01:22:28,962 --> 01:22:31,062
Us.

693
01:22:34,544 --> 01:22:36,045
Jim...

694
01:22:38,246 --> 01:22:40,447
<i> Jim?</i>

695
01:22:43,969 --> 01:22:46,770
Pick up, pick up, Jim, pick up.

696
01:22:54,653 --> 01:22:56,754
<i> Hi, you've reached the Hanson residence..</i>

697
01:22:56,755 --> 01:22:58,855
<i> You know what to do!</i>

698
01:22:58,856 --> 01:23:01,157
Listen, Linda..

699
01:23:01,158 --> 01:23:03,358
I need to tell you something.

700
01:23:04,760 --> 01:23:09,061
I meant what I said in front of
the girls the other night..

701
01:23:10,462 --> 01:23:12,783
I just.. I want you to know that..

702
01:23:14,965 --> 01:23:17,365
<i> And.. Please remember it.</i>

703
01:23:20,187 --> 01:23:22,788
Damn it, someone's calling, hold on.

704
01:23:24,070 --> 01:23:26,271
Is that you?
Linda?

705
01:23:26,272 --> 01:23:28,973
Jim!
I love you, honey.

706
01:23:31,874 --> 01:23:34,055
I need to tell you something.

707
01:23:34,096 --> 01:23:38,097
It's all right, I know about her,
I know about Claire.

708
01:23:38,878 --> 01:23:41,779
You do?
Yeah.

709
01:23:41,780 --> 01:23:45,381
I have to explain it, but..
Honey, honey, honey, listen..

710
01:23:45,422 --> 01:23:48,423
I thought that's what I wanted,
but I don't..

711
01:23:49,324 --> 01:23:52,625
I want to make things better,
you know, between us..

712
01:23:53,947 --> 01:23:56,647
Whatever it takes.

713
01:24:00,770 --> 01:24:04,070
I see you, I see you,
I'm coming up right behind you.

714
01:24:04,772 --> 01:24:06,952
<i>You are?</i>

715
01:24:06,973 --> 01:24:08,874
I'm pulling over.

716
01:24:11,176 --> 01:24:12,976
Thank you, thank you.

717
01:24:17,878 --> 01:24:19,579
I can see you, honey.

718
01:24:21,580 --> 01:24:23,781
Oh, no.

719
01:24:28,983 --> 01:24:32,384
Jim, do you love me?
Do you trust me?

720
01:24:32,385 --> 01:24:33,186
<i>Of course I do.</i>

721
01:24:33,247 --> 01:24:35,647
Then turn around now.

722
01:24:35,648 --> 01:24:37,129
What? I don't understand..

723
01:24:37,130 --> 01:24:38,750
<i>Turn it around!</i>

724
01:24:44,833 --> 01:24:46,733
Jim!

725
01:24:51,936 --> 01:24:55,337
Are you okay? Jim?

726
01:24:55,538 --> 01:24:56,498
<i> Jim?</i>

727
01:24:56,539 --> 01:24:58,240
Baby, are you all right?

728
01:24:58,541 --> 01:25:00,141
<i> Jim?</i>

729
01:25:00,542 --> 01:25:02,763
<i>Can you hear me?
Are you okay?</i>

730
01:25:02,764 --> 01:25:04,965
Baby, can you hear me?

731
01:25:04,966 --> 01:25:08,066
Sorry, I dropped the phone.

732
01:25:08,067 --> 01:25:10,888
I love you, let's go home.

733
01:25:10,969 --> 01:25:13,470
Okay, hold on.

734
01:25:24,656 --> 01:25:27,757
Jim! Jim! Get out of the car!

735
01:25:29,518 --> 01:25:32,019
Jim! Get out of the car!

736
01:25:36,623 --> 01:25:38,423
Jim!

737
01:25:43,285 --> 01:25:45,886
Get out of the car!

738
01:25:58,631 --> 01:26:02,132
Jim! Jim! Get out of the car!

739
01:27:26,578 --> 01:27:29,279
Mommy, they're here!

740
01:27:30,641 --> 01:27:34,022
Oh, no, maybe I must've have fallen asleep.
The moving truck is here.

741
01:27:34,063 --> 01:27:36,263
I know, I heard.

742
01:27:37,264 --> 01:27:39,965
You're healing so nicely.

743
01:27:41,727 --> 01:27:43,927
Why don't you guys go downstairs,
I'll be there in a second, okay?

744
01:27:43,928 --> 01:27:45,329
Okay.

745
01:28:03,175 --> 01:28:11,377
Faith is just believing something
behind yourself.. like hope, or love.

746
01:28:12,898 --> 01:28:17,740
It's never too late to realise
what's important in your life..

747
01:28:17,741 --> 01:28:19,841
To fight for it.

748
01:28:20,343 --> 01:28:23,543
I don't know what to fight for.

749
01:29:18,760 --> 01:29:23,961
Everyday we're alive, can be a miracle.
