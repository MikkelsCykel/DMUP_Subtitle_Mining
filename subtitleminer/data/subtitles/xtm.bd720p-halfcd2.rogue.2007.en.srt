1
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:20,260
Hot as hell out there, huh?

2
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,763
Well, well, well, well.

3
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:26,183
How are we today, young man?
What can I do you for?

4
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:30,604
Jeez, it must be cosy in that suit. Hey?

5
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:32,731
Oh. Yeah.
No, the airport lost all my bags.

6
00:04:32,731 --> 00:04:34,900
Well, it's gonna be
a real scorcher today.

7
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,485
Yeah. No kidding.

8
00:04:36,485 --> 00:04:38,820
I'm supposed to catch
a boat cruise from here...?

9
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:42,282
A few years back you'd be lucky
to see any tourists up here at all.

10
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:43,909
- Yeah.
- Too remote for most people.

11
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:46,662
It's changing pretty quickly,
I can tell you.

12
00:04:52,543 --> 00:04:54,962
Right. Uh, can I get a coffee, please?
Real strong.

13
00:04:54,962 --> 00:04:56,755
- Two sugars.
- How about a 'cup-a-cino'?

14
00:04:56,755 --> 00:04:59,299
Give the new machine a work-out.

15
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:04,304
Phil. Hey.

16
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:06,765
What's going on, man?

17
00:05:06,765 --> 00:05:09,226
How's Chicago?

18
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:10,769
Everything's fine,

19
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:14,273
except for the fact that
they lost my bags at the airport

20
00:05:14,273 --> 00:05:17,568
and my computer was in my bag
and I need it to finish the article,

21
00:05:17,568 --> 00:05:20,863
so could you call Greg at the office
and tell him what happened

22
00:05:20,863 --> 00:05:23,866
'cause I really need someone
to track down those bags for me.

23
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:27,870
Hello? Hello?

24
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:30,330
Hello? Can you hear me?

25
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,833
Can you hear me now? Phil?

26
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:36,044
- Get outta there.
- Can you hear me now?

27
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:38,422
Hey, can you hear me?
Hey. There you are.

28
00:05:38,422 --> 00:05:40,257
No, no, the service here sucks.

29
00:05:40,257 --> 00:05:43,594
Oh, no. Oh, no, it's over.
Yeah, she went back last week.

30
00:05:43,594 --> 00:05:45,220
Whatever.

31
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:47,806
Why do you think I took this shitty job?

32
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:49,266
Hello?

33
00:05:50,392 --> 00:05:51,852
Shit.

34
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:55,939
Jesus Christ.

35
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:05,574
There you go. Real strong.

36
00:06:05,574 --> 00:06:07,743
It's on the house.

37
00:06:07,743 --> 00:06:09,703
Oh, thanks. Thanks a lot.

38
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:15,375
Hey, nice picture.

39
00:06:16,585 --> 00:06:20,297
That silly bugger will think twice
about going swimming at night, hey?

40
00:07:08,262 --> 00:07:10,222
- Tickets.
- Dad, have you got the tickets?

41
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:13,725
Tickets.

42
00:07:17,271 --> 00:07:19,314
That's two. Two adults, one child.

43
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:24,361
Cheers. Just in the middle there.

44
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:27,364
Wow. It's so low.

45
00:07:27,364 --> 00:07:29,992
Yeah. Big one looks safer.

46
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:34,997
- Better you than me.
- OK.

47
00:07:34,997 --> 00:07:36,790
So one of the rules of my tour

48
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:40,127
is that you only have one chance
to complain about the heat and the flies.

49
00:07:40,127 --> 00:07:41,753
Nice to meet ya.

50
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:43,338
They're a fact of life up here

51
00:07:43,338 --> 00:07:46,091
and whingeing about 'em all day
isn't gonna make 'em disappear.

52
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:48,093
Simon. Get a hold of those flies.

53
00:07:48,093 --> 00:07:50,095
Might have to kick you off the boat, mate.

54
00:07:51,555 --> 00:07:53,140
Ticket?

55
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,975
Oh, I got one. Trust me.

56
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:03,400
Come on, mate.

57
00:08:06,528 --> 00:08:08,071
You got two tickets there, sir.

58
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:10,908
- Oh, no, no, no. Just me.
- No worries.

59
00:08:10,908 --> 00:08:12,409
Sit anywhere you like.

60
00:08:22,294 --> 00:08:23,837
Jesus!

61
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:27,841
We're on bush time now, so should
have youse back around 5:00. Or 6:00.

62
00:08:29,927 --> 00:08:32,513
She's your kid,
and you kind of promised her crocodiles.

63
00:08:34,056 --> 00:08:35,974
Honey, it's a two-hour tape.

64
00:08:35,974 --> 00:08:38,644
I'll get footage, OK?

65
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:47,528
Oh! Here we go.

66
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:50,906
Maybe we'll see those crocodiles.

67
00:08:50,906 --> 00:08:53,659
Welcome to Ryan's Wildlife Cruises.

68
00:08:53,659 --> 00:08:55,202
My name's Kate Ryan

69
00:08:55,202 --> 00:08:57,371
and I'm gonna be your tour guide today,

70
00:08:57,371 --> 00:08:59,164
in case you hadn't figured that out.

71
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:00,791
This is my business partner, Kevin.

72
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:02,626
Say g'day, Kev.

73
00:09:02,626 --> 00:09:05,045
Yes, you are.
Oh, my God, you're so cute.

74
00:09:06,672 --> 00:09:08,257
Honey, we should get a dog.

75
00:09:08,257 --> 00:09:10,551
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

76
00:09:10,551 --> 00:09:13,095
Thought you were a cat person.

77
00:09:13,095 --> 00:09:15,013
Anyone have any questions?

78
00:09:16,431 --> 00:09:18,851
Alright, let's go check out some crocs.

79
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:34,449
The Northern Territory
is home to the biggest population

80
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:36,493
of saltwater crocodiles in the world,

81
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:39,746
spread throughout
several large tidal river systems.

82
00:09:40,873 --> 00:09:44,126
The State covers a landmass
double the size of Texas

83
00:09:44,126 --> 00:09:49,047
but we have a population
of only 200,000 people.

84
00:09:49,047 --> 00:09:52,384
As you can imagine,
we all have pretty big backyards.

85
00:09:52,384 --> 00:09:56,054
Excuse me. Excuse me?

86
00:09:56,054 --> 00:09:57,723
- Hi there.
- Hi. I'm Gwen.

87
00:09:57,723 --> 00:10:00,100
Hi. Hi, Gwen. Would you mind...?

88
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,060
- Oh, no. Sure, help yourself.
- No, no.

89
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,812
Sorry, it's, um...

90
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:06,106
It's the smoke. It's... it's kind of wafting.

91
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:08,859
Right. Shite. OK. Story of my life!

92
00:10:08,859 --> 00:10:10,444
I'll, um, go down the back.

93
00:10:10,444 --> 00:10:12,404
- Oh, thank you so much. Thank you.
- That's OK.

94
00:10:12,404 --> 00:10:13,989
- Really appreciate that.
- Thanks a lot.

95
00:10:17,993 --> 00:10:19,745
Right.

96
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:24,500
- Come here.
- Where's the zoom on this?

97
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,543
- You don't need the zoom.
- There it is, there.

98
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:27,586
Come on, darling.

99
00:10:27,586 --> 00:10:28,921
OK. Smile.

100
00:10:30,005 --> 00:10:31,715
- Hmm.
- Oh, Sher.

101
00:10:31,715 --> 00:10:34,426
- What are you doing? Look at that.
- Oh, darling. Don't pull a face.

102
00:10:34,426 --> 00:10:36,512
- Why do you always pull a face?
- Excuse me?

103
00:10:36,512 --> 00:10:38,972
Do you want me to take
a photo of the family?

104
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:40,891
- Yeah, that...that'd be super.
- Yeah?

105
00:10:40,891 --> 00:10:42,893
- That would be good. Thank you.
- Thanks very much.

106
00:10:42,893 --> 00:10:44,520
- The big button?
- Yeah, just that one there.

107
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:48,524
OK. Here we go.

108
00:10:49,942 --> 00:10:51,527
Oh, that's beaut.

109
00:10:51,527 --> 00:10:53,445
- That is a beautiful camera.
- Thank you.

110
00:10:53,445 --> 00:10:54,988
- Yeah, is that new?
- Oh, yes.

111
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:57,741
- I got it for Christmas.
- Yeah, nice. Cute little snapper.

112
00:10:57,741 --> 00:11:01,370
I mean, she's no, um...digital SLR,

113
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:03,205
which is single lens reflex.

114
00:11:03,205 --> 00:11:08,836
I got a 25mm lens. I got a 35mm,
right through to a 1 55mm.

115
00:11:08,836 --> 00:11:10,921
Doubler pushes it out to 300mm,
but who's counting?

116
00:11:10,921 --> 00:11:12,798
- I know I'm not.
- Well, that's very impressive.

117
00:11:12,798 --> 00:11:16,552
It is indeed. Guess how much.

118
00:11:27,104 --> 00:11:29,690
Man, it's like,
you know, the 'African Queen'.

119
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:34,403
It's hot and horny
and I just wanna get naked.

120
00:11:34,403 --> 00:11:36,655
I could come into the room.

121
00:11:36,655 --> 00:11:40,200
- You know, we could do that.
- Do you want to sit somewhere else?

122
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,078
- I like sitting next to you.
- No. Do you want to sit there?

123
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:44,830
- No.
- There's a spare seat. Sit there.

124
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:47,958
- I paid for this seat.
- You're bugging me. Sit there.

125
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:50,043
- What, with the lrish girl?
- Really, no, it's sexual harassment.

126
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:51,753
- With the lrish girl?
- No, just sit here.

127
00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:54,131
You can't make everybody
move to the back of the boat.

128
00:11:54,131 --> 00:11:55,632
- No.
- Enough already with the sex talk.

129
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:57,676
- OK? OK? OK?
- It's not your boat.

130
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:24,953
Shite! It's hot, isn't it?

131
00:12:26,747 --> 00:12:28,415
Hey, what are they waiting for?

132
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:30,292
Keep watching.

133
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:34,129
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my gosh!

134
00:12:34,129 --> 00:12:36,006
- What was that?
- You right there, love?

135
00:12:36,006 --> 00:12:38,634
Look at the size of the bastard.

136
00:12:40,886 --> 00:12:42,971
Don't you worry.
He's already got his lunch.

137
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:45,015
God, that's amazing.

138
00:12:45,015 --> 00:12:47,601
- Are you right?
- How often does it do that?

139
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:50,020
Every day at 2:00.

140
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:52,523
- Wow. Every day at 2:00?
- Yep.

141
00:12:52,523 --> 00:12:54,107
And how high do they jump?

142
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:57,236
Oh, they can jump right out.
They use their tails to propel 'em.

143
00:12:57,236 --> 00:12:59,238
I mean, sometimes
they come right up to you.

144
00:12:59,238 --> 00:13:01,573
So, it could come into the boat, right?

145
00:13:01,573 --> 00:13:03,367
It could come into the boat?

146
00:13:03,367 --> 00:13:06,161
You'll be right,
so long as you don't go in the water.

147
00:13:06,161 --> 00:13:08,205
I'm not planning on it, I tell you that.

148
00:13:24,096 --> 00:13:25,639
There's a salty.

149
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:27,516
They're so still.

150
00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:37,150
- Check this out.
- That's great. That's great!

151
00:13:43,365 --> 00:13:45,909
Dad, imagine if it bit you.

152
00:13:45,909 --> 00:13:48,162
It's amazing.

153
00:13:48,162 --> 00:13:49,830
It's so still.

154
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:52,332
Looks young, though, doesn't it?
I guess that's how they catch...

155
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:53,834
Looks handsome.

156
00:14:00,883 --> 00:14:02,467
Oh. There he goes.

157
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:04,970
Alright, the species
that we're looking at today,

158
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:06,555
the saltwater crocodile,

159
00:14:06,555 --> 00:14:10,267
is probably the most dangerous member
of the crocodilian family.

160
00:14:10,267 --> 00:14:12,519
They're pretty much living dinosaurs,

161
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:14,771
who have been perfecting
their hunting skills

162
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:17,191
over 200 million years.

163
00:14:17,191 --> 00:14:20,903
So they can swim underwater
at up to 20 miles an hour

164
00:14:20,903 --> 00:14:23,947
without making a ripple on the surface.

165
00:14:23,947 --> 00:14:28,535
And they can burst out to attack
with incredible speed.

166
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:32,539
They're also known to watch their prey
and learn their habits.

167
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:36,502
In fact, you can see this bloke
looking at us now.

168
00:14:36,502 --> 00:14:39,880
So if any of you are camping up here
near a river and you need water...

169
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,548
It's got teeth like your mother.

170
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:44,051
..make sure you do so
at a different time every day

171
00:14:44,051 --> 00:14:46,220
because the croc will learn your routine.

172
00:14:47,513 --> 00:14:49,223
You might wanna avoid that.

173
00:14:49,223 --> 00:14:52,142
Croc gets a hold of you
and he can't swallow you in one go,

174
00:14:52,142 --> 00:14:54,061
he will literally tear you to pieces.

175
00:14:55,479 --> 00:14:56,522
Super.

176
00:14:56,522 --> 00:14:58,732
- Allen, can you imagine?
- So how big do they grow?

177
00:14:58,732 --> 00:15:00,442
Well, that one there was a little one,

178
00:15:00,442 --> 00:15:02,528
but they can grow
from 20 to 25 feet long,

179
00:15:02,528 --> 00:15:04,613
weigh up to two tonne.

180
00:15:04,613 --> 00:15:06,907
There have been stories of bigger ones,

181
00:15:06,907 --> 00:15:10,577
but the crocs that we're looking at today
are just as dangerous.

182
00:15:10,577 --> 00:15:12,538
Are there many attacks on people?

183
00:15:12,538 --> 00:15:14,164
Tourists, occasionally.

184
00:15:15,707 --> 00:15:18,085
That was in poor taste.

185
00:15:18,085 --> 00:15:19,670
I'll bet.

186
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:21,755
Don't worry, ma'am.
We're perfectly safe on this boat.

187
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:24,174
They won't attack anything
bigger than they are.

188
00:15:24,174 --> 00:15:26,301
- How big is this boat?
- Yeah.

189
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:30,722
- Big enough.
- Sure. Whatever.

190
00:15:30,722 --> 00:15:32,683
Lighten up a little, will you?

191
00:15:32,683 --> 00:15:35,435
Right. The bigger the better,
if you ask me.

192
00:15:58,292 --> 00:16:00,252
Aren't you beautiful, hey?

193
00:16:06,884 --> 00:16:10,971
Do you love me?
Do you love me?

194
00:16:10,971 --> 00:16:12,598
Gimme a kiss. Gimme a kiss.

195
00:16:17,853 --> 00:16:19,479
- Got a Wet One?
- Oh, yeah.

196
00:16:28,405 --> 00:16:31,074
Jesus. Anyone complain
about the flies yet?

197
00:16:31,074 --> 00:16:34,244
That was your one shot.

198
00:16:34,244 --> 00:16:37,247
That wasn't a complaint.
That was a question.

199
00:16:37,247 --> 00:16:40,375
- How long are you out here, anyway?
- Oh, just a few days.

200
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:41,960
Alice Springs after this, then home.

201
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,087
Where's that?

202
00:16:44,087 --> 00:16:45,589
Chicago.

203
00:16:45,589 --> 00:16:47,633
I'm a travel writer for a magazine.

204
00:16:47,633 --> 00:16:50,010
Sounds like the life.

205
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:51,929
How about you? You travel a lot?

206
00:16:53,138 --> 00:16:54,598
Never left the Territory.

207
00:16:56,767 --> 00:16:58,352
You're kidding, right?

208
00:16:58,352 --> 00:17:00,103
Why would I wanna leave all this?

209
00:17:02,105 --> 00:17:05,234
It's amazing watching people's faces
the first time they come out here.

210
00:17:07,194 --> 00:17:10,280
You might wanna...take your seat.

211
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,949
Gets a bit hairy around this bend.

212
00:17:14,117 --> 00:17:15,619
Aye, aye, captain.

213
00:17:32,261 --> 00:17:35,722
Sher, did you know this is
the oldest landscape in the world?

214
00:17:35,722 --> 00:17:37,307
Absolutely ancient.

215
00:17:37,307 --> 00:17:39,476
Dad, you can be so boring sometimes.

216
00:17:45,858 --> 00:17:47,442
MAN AND One, two...

217
00:17:47,442 --> 00:17:50,863
I got you.

218
00:17:53,949 --> 00:17:56,326
Did you see that?!

219
00:17:56,326 --> 00:17:57,870
No.

220
00:17:57,870 --> 00:17:59,872
Yee-hoo! Whoo-hoo!

221
00:18:00,998 --> 00:18:02,791
Oh, my gosh. They're stopping.

222
00:18:11,008 --> 00:18:13,177
Oooh!

223
00:18:13,177 --> 00:18:14,928
Keep your shirt on, cunt-face.

224
00:18:17,764 --> 00:18:20,225
- Katie.
- G'day, Neil.

225
00:18:20,225 --> 00:18:21,977
Oi.

226
00:18:21,977 --> 00:18:24,980
Bloody charming. There's ladies present.

227
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:26,481
Sorry, ladies.

228
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:33,030
Sorry about that, folks.
This shouldn't take a minute.

229
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:36,950
- Oooh!
- Mate, I'm at work.

230
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:39,495
Katie, we're just saying g'day
to the tourists, yeah?

231
00:18:39,495 --> 00:18:41,955
- G'day, tourists.
- Tourists.

232
00:18:41,955 --> 00:18:43,582
Yeah, you can take the photo, darlin'.

233
00:18:43,582 --> 00:18:45,209
Oooh, please. Pop it out.

234
00:18:45,209 --> 00:18:47,544
Hope you brought
your microscope!

235
00:18:47,544 --> 00:18:50,088
Alright, you've acquainted yourself
with the tourists.

236
00:18:50,088 --> 00:18:52,549
Now would you acquaint yourself
with the other end of the river?

237
00:18:55,511 --> 00:18:57,221
Come on, mate. Let's just fuck off, eh?

238
00:18:57,221 --> 00:18:58,805
No, hang on.

239
00:18:58,805 --> 00:19:03,060
I just wanna know why
Miss Captain Katie Coo here

240
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:05,812
is acting so high and mighty these days.

241
00:19:05,812 --> 00:19:09,066
What is it, Katie?
Why won't you have a bar of me, sweet?

242
00:19:09,066 --> 00:19:12,861
Excuse me, son, the young lady
asked you politely to remove yourself.

243
00:19:12,861 --> 00:19:14,821
We'd like to get on with our tour.

244
00:19:16,031 --> 00:19:20,285
Fuck me, it's John fuckin' Wayne.
This is the tour, John.

245
00:19:20,285 --> 00:19:25,082
Me and Col, we're the wildlife.

246
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:28,836
Hello.

247
00:19:28,836 --> 00:19:31,922
- We're ducks!
- I'm gonna keep this simple for you.

248
00:19:31,922 --> 00:19:34,007
I'm gonna count to three
and ask you to leave.

249
00:19:34,007 --> 00:19:35,926
What the fuck are you gawking at,
four-eyes?

250
00:19:35,926 --> 00:19:37,469
- One.
- I don't know.

251
00:19:37,469 --> 00:19:40,180
I got the brochure but it didn't
say anything about assholes.

252
00:19:41,265 --> 00:19:42,766
- He's a poofter, mate.
- Two.

253
00:19:45,185 --> 00:19:46,770
I'm not kidding, mate.

254
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:48,397
Bullshit, Katie.

255
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:51,859
Fuck!

256
00:19:51,859 --> 00:19:53,485
- Oooh!
- Whoa!

257
00:19:54,611 --> 00:19:56,405
Jeez...

258
00:19:56,405 --> 00:19:57,990
Get out!

259
00:20:01,034 --> 00:20:02,536
You right there, mate?

260
00:20:04,997 --> 00:20:07,875
- Sorry about that, folks.
- Unbelievable.

261
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:09,459
As you can see, human pollution

262
00:20:09,459 --> 00:20:12,337
is one of the greatest threats
to the environment out here.

263
00:20:13,422 --> 00:20:17,134
Collin! Collin, you bloody idiot!

264
00:20:19,011 --> 00:20:21,555
- Sorry, mate. I...
- What are you fuckin' doing?!

265
00:20:31,398 --> 00:20:34,151
Forget it, mate. It's over.

266
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:49,309
About 1 0 days. Yeah,
we got four weeks all up, so...

267
00:21:49,309 --> 00:21:52,479
Nice. I'm seeing things
I don't think my friends would believe.

268
00:21:52,479 --> 00:21:56,149
We got some on you inadvertently before.

269
00:21:58,569 --> 00:22:00,654
Alright, we'll be heading home now.

270
00:22:01,864 --> 00:22:03,866
Should take us about an hour or so.

271
00:22:03,866 --> 00:22:08,245
I'll have you back in time to grab an
ice-cream on your way back to town.

272
00:22:08,245 --> 00:22:11,790
- Oh, swell.
- Thank you all for a wonderful day.

273
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:13,417
Finishes now?

274
00:22:15,127 --> 00:22:19,548
Um, special thanks
to John Wayne and to 'Four-Eyes'.

275
00:22:21,133 --> 00:22:22,676
Top work, Four-Eyes.

276
00:22:22,676 --> 00:22:24,428
I think they deserve a round of applause.

277
00:22:26,346 --> 00:22:28,182
- Thanks, guys.
- Well done. Well done.

278
00:22:29,308 --> 00:22:31,977
Up in this part of the world,
we call you 'top blokes'.

279
00:22:33,478 --> 00:22:35,314
Don't know where I'd have been
without youse.

280
00:22:39,568 --> 00:22:41,069
Please don't film me.

281
00:22:41,069 --> 00:22:42,571
Honey, please don't.

282
00:22:49,703 --> 00:22:51,205
Did you see that?

283
00:22:51,205 --> 00:22:53,665
- No. What?
- I think I saw something.

284
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:57,503
Flare, I think. Up there. There.

285
00:22:59,129 --> 00:23:01,006
Should we say something?

286
00:23:01,006 --> 00:23:03,425
- Excuse me, miss.
- My husband just saw something.

287
00:23:03,425 --> 00:23:05,469
I think it was a flare.

288
00:23:05,469 --> 00:23:08,180
- Where'd you see it?
- Up there.

289
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:09,890
A flare?

290
00:23:12,601 --> 00:23:14,394
Did anyone else see it? No?

291
00:23:14,394 --> 00:23:16,271
- No. No.
- No.

292
00:23:16,271 --> 00:23:18,690
- Wait. I got the tape.
- Yeah. Rewind it a little bit.

293
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:20,192
Yeah. It's right here.

294
00:23:22,486 --> 00:23:24,196
Oh, Jesus! I saw it.

295
00:23:24,196 --> 00:23:25,989
- Yeah!
- There's one. There's one!

296
00:23:33,413 --> 00:23:35,415
- Did you see that flare?
- I saw it..

297
00:23:35,415 --> 00:23:39,336
Base, this is 'The Suzanne'.
Are you there, Bill? Over.

298
00:23:41,797 --> 00:23:45,300
Base, this is 'The Suzanne'.
Do you read me? Over.

299
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:48,470
I can't understand you.

300
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:51,974
I'm in Kingston Gorge and I'm getting
severe interference. Do you read me?

301
00:23:51,974 --> 00:23:54,852
I think I just saw a flare.

302
00:23:54,852 --> 00:23:57,229
So I'm gonna head upriver
and check it out.

303
00:23:57,229 --> 00:23:59,439
'Suzanne', out.

304
00:24:07,698 --> 00:24:10,492
Alright, we've just seen
what looks like a distress flare,

305
00:24:10,492 --> 00:24:13,537
so we're gonna take a quick run upriver

306
00:24:13,537 --> 00:24:15,205
and see if anyone's in trouble.

307
00:24:15,205 --> 00:24:17,833
I realise this is a bit of an inconvenience,

308
00:24:17,833 --> 00:24:19,585
but we do have to respond.

309
00:24:19,585 --> 00:24:21,670
I got a bus to catch at 6:30.

310
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:23,589
Yeah, so do we. We're meeting family.

311
00:24:23,589 --> 00:24:25,632
Who do you think it is?

312
00:24:25,632 --> 00:24:28,468
Could be poachers.
They sometimes go into Arnhem Land.

313
00:24:28,468 --> 00:24:30,804
It could be anyone.

314
00:24:30,804 --> 00:24:33,140
It could be anyone,
and if it was you up there,

315
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:36,435
you'd want me to respond in exactly
the same way, so keep your seat, sir.

316
00:24:36,435 --> 00:24:38,353
I'm sorry, but my wife and l,
we really...

317
00:24:38,353 --> 00:24:40,647
- Allen, please. I'm fine.
- I'm not having you here all day.

318
00:24:40,647 --> 00:24:42,441
How long do you think it'll take?

319
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:45,944
Can't be more
than a couple of miles upriver.

320
00:24:49,239 --> 00:24:51,366
OK, you're alright. You're alright.

321
00:25:00,501 --> 00:25:01,960
Listen, she's fine.

322
00:25:47,422 --> 00:25:48,882
Are you OK?

323
00:25:50,759 --> 00:25:52,845
Not really supposed to go through here.

324
00:25:52,845 --> 00:25:55,055
This is sacred land.

325
00:25:55,055 --> 00:25:57,558
Shouldn't really matter
if someone's in trouble, right?

326
00:25:59,935 --> 00:26:01,478
She'll be right.

327
00:28:19,324 --> 00:28:21,994
I reckon it came from
deeper in the swamp somewhere.

328
00:28:25,914 --> 00:28:28,375
What do you think?

329
00:28:28,375 --> 00:28:32,129
I think we've gone as far as we can.
Besides, there's nobody here.

330
00:28:32,129 --> 00:28:34,047
It's gonna get dark soon.
We should probably go.

331
00:28:37,426 --> 00:28:38,886
Probably right.

332
00:28:42,598 --> 00:28:44,057
What?

333
00:28:59,490 --> 00:29:01,575
Well, I suppose that's where
the flares came from.

334
00:29:03,869 --> 00:29:05,412
This has really gone too far.

335
00:29:05,412 --> 00:29:08,040
We must get back.
I can't have you out here any longer.

336
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,541
OK, we should...

337
00:29:10,667 --> 00:29:12,127
What was that?

338
00:29:14,338 --> 00:29:16,715
- Oh, shit, we're sinking.
- Oh, my God! We're sinking!

339
00:29:16,715 --> 00:29:18,383
- There's a hole!
- What's happened?

340
00:29:18,383 --> 00:29:20,260
Are we moving? Move it!

341
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:22,554
There! There!

342
00:29:24,473 --> 00:29:26,975
Hold on! Hold on to your seats!

343
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,855
Just hold on to your seats.

344
00:29:31,855 --> 00:29:33,524
We're almost there. Just hold on.

345
00:29:37,986 --> 00:29:39,571
Let's get off. Get off, now!

346
00:29:43,325 --> 00:29:45,828
Get off the boat. Hurry.

347
00:29:45,828 --> 00:29:47,871
Get off the boat.

348
00:30:07,933 --> 00:30:10,352
Alright, there's a radio
in one of these bags.

349
00:30:12,229 --> 00:30:14,064
Should be in here somewhere.

350
00:30:17,109 --> 00:30:18,694
Right.

351
00:30:18,694 --> 00:30:20,404
Can you find it in there?

352
00:30:20,404 --> 00:30:22,698
No, it's not in there.

353
00:30:22,698 --> 00:30:25,159
It's underwater.

354
00:30:25,159 --> 00:30:26,785
- Oh, shit!
- Is it working?

355
00:30:26,785 --> 00:30:29,955
- What about the boat radio?
- It's wet but it should work.

356
00:30:29,955 --> 00:30:31,707
Stay off the boat.

357
00:30:31,707 --> 00:30:33,584
It's not working, mate.

358
00:30:33,584 --> 00:30:35,169
It's underwater.

359
00:30:35,169 --> 00:30:39,256
Can you take that up on the hill
and see if you can dry it out?

360
00:30:39,256 --> 00:30:42,050
Just keep
switching channels, mate.

361
00:30:44,303 --> 00:30:45,804
No bloody radio!

362
00:30:45,804 --> 00:30:49,391
You've got us stuck on this
tiny little island with no bloody radio!

363
00:30:51,059 --> 00:30:53,312
Great!

364
00:30:53,312 --> 00:30:54,980
Kate?

365
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:57,941
Emergency. Hello.
Can anyone hear me? Over.

366
00:30:57,941 --> 00:30:59,443
What's going on here?

367
00:30:59,443 --> 00:31:01,278
We're gonna miss the bus.
We're late already.

368
00:31:01,278 --> 00:31:02,863
- Are you alright?
- Yeah. I'm just...

369
00:31:02,863 --> 00:31:04,948
- So we have no radio?
- I don't want to be here.

370
00:31:04,948 --> 00:31:06,450
Take a deep breath.

371
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:08,202
- You'll be alright, OK? You know?
- Yeah.

372
00:31:08,202 --> 00:31:10,704
Miss, we have no radio,
so what the hell happens now?

373
00:31:10,704 --> 00:31:12,581
Well, how will anyone know
where we are?

374
00:31:12,581 --> 00:31:16,460
I thought you said
crocs wouldn't attack a boat.

375
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:18,921
Alright, they're territorial animals, so...

376
00:31:20,005 --> 00:31:21,507
..if we've stumbled into one's territory

377
00:31:21,507 --> 00:31:24,843
it's possible it might've
given us a little nudge,

378
00:31:24,843 --> 00:31:27,679
just to let us know we're not wanted.

379
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:31,225
"A little nudge"? Tell that
to whoever was in that boat.

380
00:31:31,225 --> 00:31:33,602
My God,
we're in the middle of nowhere here.

381
00:31:33,602 --> 00:31:35,896
Listen, we have to stay calm, yeah?
We're gonna be fine.

382
00:31:35,896 --> 00:31:37,481
My dad's gonna realise
something's happened

383
00:31:37,481 --> 00:31:39,608
and he'll send a search party to find us.

384
00:31:40,901 --> 00:31:42,694
When might that be, exactly?

385
00:31:42,694 --> 00:31:46,073
Well, we're a long way upriver,
so it could take a couple of hours.

386
00:31:46,073 --> 00:31:48,116
This is a tidal river, isn't it?

387
00:31:48,116 --> 00:31:51,119
- This is a bloody tidal river!
- What? What does that mean?

388
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:54,623
See those trees? That's how high
the tide will be when it comes in.

389
00:31:54,623 --> 00:31:56,375
The whole bloody place
will be underwater.

390
00:31:56,375 --> 00:31:58,168
Look, that won't be for hours

391
00:31:58,168 --> 00:32:00,629
and we should have time
to fix the boat by then.

392
00:32:00,629 --> 00:32:03,924
Miss, I don't know a lot
about boats but, seriously,

393
00:32:03,924 --> 00:32:07,636
we can't sit on this pile of mud
waiting to go underwater in pitch black.

394
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:12,683
If we can get across,
we can walk it in a few hours.

395
00:32:12,683 --> 00:32:14,893
It's the only way we're gonna get help.

396
00:32:14,893 --> 00:32:17,771
- How the hell you gonna get across?
- Well, how do you think?

397
00:32:17,771 --> 00:32:19,690
So, what do you say, mate?
You with me?

398
00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:22,693
- No! No, Everett, no.
- Honey. It's OK.

399
00:32:22,693 --> 00:32:26,029
I am in charge of this group
and what you are suggesting is crazy.

400
00:32:26,029 --> 00:32:29,616
If we don't get across right now
it's gonna be too late.

401
00:32:29,616 --> 00:32:31,201
Alright? You understand?

402
00:32:33,078 --> 00:32:34,913
Well, what?

403
00:32:34,913 --> 00:32:38,500
Would you lot prefer to get through that
in the dark? Come on!

404
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:40,627
I don't know! I friggin' well don't know!

405
00:32:40,627 --> 00:32:43,797
- Bloody hell!
- You're not going in the water!

406
00:32:43,797 --> 00:32:45,424
Hey. Hey, buddy!

407
00:32:45,424 --> 00:32:47,759
Come on. Come on, buddy.

408
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:49,803
- Come on!
- Get your hands...off me!

409
00:32:49,803 --> 00:32:51,972
Hey, hey, hey. Shush, shush!

410
00:32:54,099 --> 00:32:55,851
Shh. I can hear something.

411
00:32:59,062 --> 00:33:02,316
What channel is it?

412
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:09,281
- Look at this thing!
- Oh, my God.

413
00:33:09,281 --> 00:33:11,116
Where the hell did he go?

414
00:33:11,116 --> 00:33:14,369
Somebody do something! Everett!

415
00:33:14,369 --> 00:33:16,330
Everett!

416
00:33:16,330 --> 00:33:18,165
Everett?! Everett!

417
00:33:18,165 --> 00:33:20,417
- Everett!
- Stand back.

418
00:33:20,417 --> 00:33:21,710
No!

419
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:24,046
- Come back from the water.
- Get the fuck away from me!

420
00:33:24,046 --> 00:33:27,674
Come back. Come back!
All of you, stay away from the water!

421
00:33:27,674 --> 00:33:29,927
- Everett!
- Jesus!

422
00:33:29,927 --> 00:33:32,137
It's gonna be OK.
It's gonna be alright.

423
00:33:34,056 --> 00:33:35,849
No! No!

424
00:33:35,849 --> 00:33:37,392
Everett!

425
00:33:41,563 --> 00:33:43,023
Somebody do something!

426
00:34:48,297 --> 00:34:50,215
How long did you say
until the tide comes?

427
00:34:50,215 --> 00:34:51,758
Can you grab that flashlight?

428
00:34:51,758 --> 00:34:54,261
What, like a couple hours, or...?

429
00:34:54,261 --> 00:34:56,180
What?

430
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:58,932
How long do we have before
the tide comes in? Hours or minutes?

431
00:35:00,893 --> 00:35:02,811
Look, with an animal that aggressive
out there,

432
00:35:02,811 --> 00:35:05,898
I think the tide's
the least of our problems.

433
00:35:05,898 --> 00:35:08,775
It's gonna be dark soon.
We need light to see. It doesn't.

434
00:35:08,775 --> 00:35:11,528
We have to get off the island.
We can't go in the water.

435
00:35:11,528 --> 00:35:13,614
So how the fuck
are we gonna get off here?

436
00:35:13,614 --> 00:35:16,408
I thought you were supposed to be
some kind of fearless travel writer.

437
00:35:16,408 --> 00:35:19,161
Yeah, well, I just saw a man
get eaten by a fucking crocodile.

438
00:35:19,161 --> 00:35:21,747
This is not what I do, alright?
You know what I do?

439
00:35:21,747 --> 00:35:25,125
I write stupid articles about hotels
and restaurants and resorts,

440
00:35:25,125 --> 00:35:27,252
not about the Australian outback.

441
00:35:27,252 --> 00:35:29,171
And by the way, I fucking hate animals,

442
00:35:29,171 --> 00:35:30,631
especially ones that can kill you.

443
00:35:32,466 --> 00:35:35,427
Speaking of which, I'm gonna kill
my fuckin' editor when I get home.

444
00:35:40,057 --> 00:35:41,600
Can't find the flares.

445
00:35:43,435 --> 00:35:45,312
Would they be in a giant yellow box

446
00:35:45,312 --> 00:35:47,481
with the word 'flares'
written on the side of it?

447
00:35:47,481 --> 00:35:49,233
- Where?
- Over there.

448
00:35:51,652 --> 00:35:53,111
Shit!

449
00:35:54,905 --> 00:35:56,949
We are completely fucked.

450
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:02,621
Over here! Quickly!

451
00:36:03,872 --> 00:36:05,374
Quickly.

452
00:36:05,374 --> 00:36:08,126
- Did you get something?
- I think it's music. Listen.

453
00:36:14,383 --> 00:36:15,968
It's them.

454
00:36:20,138 --> 00:36:22,516
Whoo-hoo! Hey! Hey!

455
00:36:24,017 --> 00:36:25,769
Whoo-hoo!

456
00:36:25,769 --> 00:36:28,730
Told you to keep going.
Told you they'd be there.

457
00:36:30,941 --> 00:36:32,609
Hey!

458
00:36:32,609 --> 00:36:35,320
Look at that. She's pretty
happy to see you now, mate.

459
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:37,739
- Mate, watch out!
- Whoo!

460
00:36:37,739 --> 00:36:40,075
Neil, we need help!

461
00:36:42,536 --> 00:36:45,998
- What are you doing?
- Hey, Neil! Watch out. Neil!

462
00:36:47,332 --> 00:36:49,543
Get off the boat!

463
00:36:49,543 --> 00:36:51,170
What are you doing?

464
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:53,589
Boys!

465
00:36:53,589 --> 00:36:56,466
- Whoo-hoo!
- Slow down. Slow down.

466
00:36:56,466 --> 00:36:58,927
Come in, you...

467
00:36:58,927 --> 00:37:00,470
- Neil!
- Come back!

468
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:02,014
I'm not kidding!

469
00:37:02,014 --> 00:37:03,098
What?

470
00:37:03,098 --> 00:37:04,183
I can't...

471
00:37:04,183 --> 00:37:06,393
He cannot hear you!

472
00:37:06,393 --> 00:37:08,228
Now you wanna talk to me? Huh?

473
00:37:12,191 --> 00:37:15,235
What's wrong with the boat?

474
00:37:33,045 --> 00:37:35,172
Swim!

475
00:37:35,172 --> 00:37:38,675
Mate, swim!
Swim! Come on, mate! Keep coming!

476
00:37:42,054 --> 00:37:44,348
Come on, Neil!

477
00:37:44,348 --> 00:37:47,434
Come on, mate. Hurry up.
You can do it.

478
00:37:47,434 --> 00:37:49,811
Get out.

479
00:37:55,651 --> 00:37:57,694
- Oh, shit!
- Collin!

480
00:37:59,655 --> 00:38:01,156
Collin!

481
00:38:04,576 --> 00:38:06,078
Collin!

482
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:13,043
Fucking hell!

483
00:39:11,685 --> 00:39:14,605
I can't imagine how she feels.

484
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:23,363
So, how long before your father comes?

485
00:39:59,942 --> 00:40:02,778
Shit. I can't get this thing to start.

486
00:40:04,488 --> 00:40:06,949
Oh. That worked.

487
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:11,411
Local technique, mate.

488
00:40:21,964 --> 00:40:25,008
Right, I've figured out
a way to get across.

489
00:40:25,008 --> 00:40:26,552
We just saw that woman...

490
00:40:27,678 --> 00:40:30,764
Well, how you gonna get across
without getting in the water?

491
00:40:30,764 --> 00:40:33,267
I am getting in the water.

492
00:40:33,267 --> 00:40:35,269
Neil...

493
00:40:35,269 --> 00:40:37,771
I'm gonna swim across, real quiet.

494
00:40:39,231 --> 00:40:40,899
I'm gonna tie a rope

495
00:40:40,899 --> 00:40:43,819
from one of these trees
to one of those trees over there.

496
00:40:43,819 --> 00:40:45,946
We'll suspend it
a few metres above the water.

497
00:40:45,946 --> 00:40:48,490
We all climb across. Piece of piss.

498
00:40:48,490 --> 00:40:52,786
We just saw crocodiles jump
four feet out of the water today.

499
00:40:52,786 --> 00:40:55,789
- My wife won't be able to cross.
- She's gonna have to, mate.

500
00:40:55,789 --> 00:40:58,000
But... can we come back with help?

501
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,086
By the time we get back, you know,
this island's not gonna be here.

502
00:41:01,086 --> 00:41:02,921
Oh, great!

503
00:41:02,921 --> 00:41:05,048
Fucking brilliant!

504
00:41:05,048 --> 00:41:09,178
Oi, your wife will be fine.
We will all be fine.

505
00:41:09,178 --> 00:41:12,472
But we have to move right now
before it comes back.

506
00:41:12,472 --> 00:41:14,683
What makes you so sure
it's going to come back?

507
00:41:14,683 --> 00:41:17,019
Look around you, champ.

508
00:41:17,019 --> 00:41:20,189
We are still in its territory
and it doesn't like it.

509
00:41:20,189 --> 00:41:22,316
Plus he's probably already tagged us,
Katie, so...

510
00:41:22,316 --> 00:41:24,943
- Wh-what?
- Tagged us?

511
00:41:24,943 --> 00:41:27,613
They tag you as a food supply.
They don't stop.

512
00:41:27,613 --> 00:41:31,450
It's like a vicious dog who's guarding
a piece of meat in its backyard.

513
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:33,118
Jesus!

514
00:41:34,203 --> 00:41:37,206
Then they take you back to the place
where it stores its kills and...

515
00:41:41,126 --> 00:41:43,545
Under a log or a burrow somewhere.

516
00:41:46,215 --> 00:41:49,760
Like I said, now is the best time to move
because the fucker is busy.

517
00:41:52,846 --> 00:41:54,598
Listen, Neil...

518
00:41:54,598 --> 00:41:56,308
Look, the tide's rising.

519
00:41:56,308 --> 00:41:58,477
We've got no choice.

520
00:41:58,477 --> 00:42:00,646
We go now, we have a chance,
or later...

521
00:42:02,272 --> 00:42:03,774
You figure it out.

522
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:09,321
- You want a hand, do you?
- Yeah.

523
00:42:10,405 --> 00:42:12,407
My God.

524
00:42:18,121 --> 00:42:20,833
We're going to tie a rope
from the island trees to the shore.

525
00:42:21,917 --> 00:42:23,961
Plan is to climb across.

526
00:42:25,546 --> 00:42:27,172
Mum?

527
00:42:27,172 --> 00:42:29,800
You'll be able to cross fine. Don't worry.

528
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,927
Of course I will, sweetheart.

529
00:42:31,927 --> 00:42:33,512
Course I will.

530
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:45,482
Neil! Neil?

531
00:42:45,482 --> 00:42:47,943
I don't think this is a good idea.

532
00:42:47,943 --> 00:42:50,654
-Someone's got to cross.
-You don't have to do this.

533
00:42:51,738 --> 00:42:54,074
OK, well, what do we do?

534
00:42:56,493 --> 00:42:58,662
I think...

535
00:42:58,662 --> 00:43:01,331
I'm not doing this to prove anything.

536
00:43:02,457 --> 00:43:04,459
It's just...

537
00:43:05,878 --> 00:43:08,255
I mean, you wanna go home, don't you?

538
00:43:10,215 --> 00:43:12,259
- Yeah, of course.
- Right.

539
00:43:18,682 --> 00:43:20,517
Here. Hold this.

540
00:43:23,103 --> 00:43:27,024
Why don't you tie it around your waist?
I'll feed it out to you.

541
00:43:27,024 --> 00:43:28,942
You'd better feed it out fucking fast, mate.

542
00:43:32,738 --> 00:43:36,074
- You're not as stupid as you look.
- Yeah, hopefully you're not either.

543
00:43:39,870 --> 00:43:41,330
Keep away from the water.

544
00:43:45,125 --> 00:43:47,586
Right, here's one.

545
00:43:51,048 --> 00:43:52,549
Here's another one.

546
00:43:54,092 --> 00:43:56,261
Why do you think it's doing this?

547
00:43:56,261 --> 00:43:59,431
Heard stories of 'em getting territorial,

548
00:43:59,431 --> 00:44:01,892
but... people just keep going

549
00:44:01,892 --> 00:44:03,352
and they leave 'em alone.

550
00:44:04,561 --> 00:44:08,023
Us being here?
That's gonna be driving him crazy.

551
00:44:08,023 --> 00:44:10,192
He's gonna feel as if we're moving in.

552
00:44:10,192 --> 00:44:12,653
Yeah, but this is still pretty weird, right?

553
00:44:16,114 --> 00:44:17,115
Ready?

554
00:44:20,494 --> 00:44:22,412
OK, we're right?

555
00:46:06,391 --> 00:46:07,851
Can I go first?

556
00:46:09,770 --> 00:46:11,605
I just wanna get home.

557
00:46:42,427 --> 00:46:43,887
Oh, thank God!

558
00:47:07,077 --> 00:47:09,329
He's done it.

559
00:47:09,329 --> 00:47:11,123
- Alright!
- Good work.

560
00:47:28,098 --> 00:47:30,475
I don't know
if I can hold on that long.

561
00:47:30,475 --> 00:47:34,104
Alright, turn around. Both your knees up.

562
00:47:34,104 --> 00:47:36,106
OK, let's go. Up you go.

563
00:47:36,106 --> 00:47:38,192
Russell, can you get her up
on the rope?

564
00:47:38,192 --> 00:47:40,194
There you go.
Watch your foot.

565
00:47:40,194 --> 00:47:41,904
Alright, Mary-Ellen.

566
00:47:41,904 --> 00:47:43,405
- Grab the rope.
- You'll be right.

567
00:47:43,405 --> 00:47:47,284
Now wrap your legs around the rope
and then it's just like I told you -

568
00:47:47,284 --> 00:47:50,454
one hand in front of the other
and you'll be over there in no time.

569
00:47:50,454 --> 00:47:54,082
That's it. There you go.

570
00:47:54,082 --> 00:47:56,627
- That's it.
- It's doing well.

571
00:47:56,627 --> 00:47:58,170
- Really good.
- Come on!

572
00:47:58,170 --> 00:47:59,880
There you go. You right?

573
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:01,965
That's good.

574
00:48:01,965 --> 00:48:04,426
We're gonna have you outta here
in no time. That's it.

575
00:48:06,011 --> 00:48:09,139
Simon, if you see
the slightest move, mate, you tell us.

576
00:48:11,850 --> 00:48:14,895
Liz? I'm gonna take Sherry across.

577
00:48:14,895 --> 00:48:16,647
OK? I'll be straight back for you.

578
00:48:16,647 --> 00:48:18,607
We'll be absolutely fine.
We'll be absolutely fine.

579
00:48:18,607 --> 00:48:20,818
It's alright, love.

580
00:48:20,818 --> 00:48:23,904
That's it. That's great.

581
00:48:23,904 --> 00:48:27,199
You're across the water right now,
so I just want you to keep breathing...

582
00:48:27,199 --> 00:48:28,992
- Can you see anything?
- Stay relaxed.

583
00:48:28,992 --> 00:48:30,994
Russell, shut the fuck up.

584
00:48:32,579 --> 00:48:35,916
We'll be fine. We'll all be fine.
We'll all be fine.

585
00:48:35,916 --> 00:48:37,417
Just keep going.

586
00:48:41,004 --> 00:48:44,716
You're almost there.
Just keep breathing.

587
00:48:44,716 --> 00:48:46,718
That's it.

588
00:48:48,262 --> 00:48:50,639
Keep... keep breathing.

589
00:48:57,729 --> 00:48:59,940
It's alright, love. Just take your time.

590
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:01,608
It's not alright.
I can't hold on.

591
00:49:03,527 --> 00:49:05,028
I have to stop.

592
00:49:08,031 --> 00:49:10,117
It's alright, Mary-Ellen.
You're gonna be fine.

593
00:49:10,117 --> 00:49:12,202
Just keep breathing.

594
00:49:14,329 --> 00:49:16,999
- You're gonna be fine.
- What's she doing? She's stopping.

595
00:49:16,999 --> 00:49:18,917
She'll get us all killed if she doesn't hurry.

596
00:49:18,917 --> 00:49:22,254
I can't! I can't! I can't!

597
00:49:23,338 --> 00:49:24,840
Come on.

598
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:27,176
You're doing fine.

599
00:49:27,176 --> 00:49:28,844
I can't hold on.

600
00:49:28,844 --> 00:49:31,597
Is she right?

601
00:49:32,681 --> 00:49:34,641
Oh, she...she's frozen.

602
00:49:34,641 --> 00:49:38,020
Sherry, Sherry, Sherry. Come on.
We're going. We're going.

603
00:49:40,230 --> 00:49:42,399
- I can't hold on!
- Wait a minute.

604
00:49:42,399 --> 00:49:44,818
- Don't you fucking touch me!
- Oi! Oi! Come on!

605
00:49:44,818 --> 00:49:46,445
Don't you fucking
come anywhere near me!

606
00:49:46,445 --> 00:49:48,906
- You fuck off!
- Calm down, mate.

607
00:49:50,532 --> 00:49:52,367
Don't you put her on that rope.

608
00:49:52,367 --> 00:49:54,036
Fuckhead,
the rope won't take three people OK?

609
00:49:54,036 --> 00:49:56,163
I am not going to let that woman

610
00:49:56,163 --> 00:49:58,582
endanger the lives of my wife
and my child!

611
00:49:58,582 --> 00:50:00,292
Slow down and think about
what you're doing.

612
00:50:00,292 --> 00:50:01,877
- Why don't you fuck off?!
- Get down!

613
00:50:01,877 --> 00:50:05,881
- Jesus Christ. Get him down!
- Stay away! Stay away from me!

614
00:50:08,592 --> 00:50:10,511
Get down now!

615
00:50:10,511 --> 00:50:13,138
Fucking don't do that, you stupid fucker.

616
00:50:13,138 --> 00:50:15,682
- Alright, Sherry. I'm here.
- Are you crazy? Get off the rope!

617
00:50:15,682 --> 00:50:18,644
- There shouldn't be three people...
- We know that, mate!

618
00:50:20,437 --> 00:50:21,939
Bloody English idiot.

619
00:50:21,939 --> 00:50:23,524
Keep going, Sher. It's alright. I'm here.

620
00:50:23,524 --> 00:50:26,527
Just... We're right behind you, Sher.

621
00:50:26,527 --> 00:50:28,028
- Just hold on.
- Something just moved.

622
00:50:28,028 --> 00:50:30,405
Mary-Ellen, Allen and Sherry
are on the rope behind you.

623
00:50:30,405 --> 00:50:32,533
It's alright. I'm here.
You'll be across in no time.

624
00:50:38,580 --> 00:50:41,625
Just move, Mary Ellen!
There's two people behind you. Move!

625
00:50:41,625 --> 00:50:43,627
OK, Sher. I'm here. I'm right behind you.

626
00:50:43,627 --> 00:50:46,213
Right behind you, Sher. Keep going.

627
00:50:47,881 --> 00:50:49,383
She's not moving.

628
00:50:49,383 --> 00:50:51,260
For Christ's sake, move!

629
00:50:52,719 --> 00:50:54,263
I can't.

630
00:50:54,263 --> 00:50:55,931
- You can!
- Come on.

631
00:50:55,931 --> 00:50:59,226
Neil, she's frozen. Get her moving!

632
00:50:59,226 --> 00:51:00,978
Keep go...

633
00:51:11,196 --> 00:51:13,157
Neil, she's freaked. Get her moving!

634
00:51:13,157 --> 00:51:15,534
Move!
Move, for God's sake! Move!

635
00:51:15,534 --> 00:51:17,244
Neil?

636
00:51:17,244 --> 00:51:18,787
- Neil, come on!
- Neil?!

637
00:51:18,787 --> 00:51:22,082
- What's happening?
- Oh, shit!

638
00:51:22,082 --> 00:51:25,085
Move! Move!

639
00:51:25,085 --> 00:51:26,712
No, Sher! No, Sher! No...

640
00:51:28,255 --> 00:51:30,591
Oh! Oh!

641
00:51:32,843 --> 00:51:34,344
- Just hold on tight.
- Daddy!

642
00:51:35,596 --> 00:51:38,974
- Oh, God!
- Move! Move!

643
00:51:38,974 --> 00:51:40,642
Do something! Do something!

644
00:51:40,642 --> 00:51:42,102
Don't let go. Keep going!

645
00:51:53,864 --> 00:51:55,365
Come on. Swim!

646
00:52:11,673 --> 00:52:13,800
Oh, my God!

647
00:52:16,762 --> 00:52:18,597
You alright? You alright?

648
00:52:32,569 --> 00:52:34,071
Oh, fuck.

649
00:52:39,243 --> 00:52:40,911
Kate, get back from the water.

650
00:52:48,752 --> 00:52:49,753
No.

651
00:53:02,474 --> 00:53:05,018
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

652
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:17,781
Daddy!

653
00:53:30,878 --> 00:53:32,379
No!

654
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:40,596
Oh! Oh, my God!

655
00:54:38,445 --> 00:54:42,115
It can't be long now.
Someone will find us soon.

656
00:54:42,115 --> 00:54:43,575
It'll be alright.

657
00:54:45,828 --> 00:54:48,789
Where are you, you... bastards?

658
00:54:52,709 --> 00:54:54,628
Sorry. Does that hurt?

659
00:54:54,628 --> 00:54:56,588
No. It's... It's fine.

660
00:54:56,588 --> 00:54:59,925
I just... I think... I think I sprained it.

661
00:54:59,925 --> 00:55:02,052
Oh, God!

662
00:55:02,052 --> 00:55:07,015
- How are they?
- Um...Sherry's in... in shock.

663
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:11,186
And Elizabeth's not doing very well.

664
00:55:11,186 --> 00:55:14,690
She needs to...take her medication.

665
00:55:15,899 --> 00:55:17,484
Where is it?

666
00:55:17,484 --> 00:55:19,278
She...

667
00:55:19,278 --> 00:55:22,865
She left it on the back of the boat,
so its probably floated away.

668
00:55:22,865 --> 00:55:26,743
But there's painkillers
in the, uh...the first aid kit.

669
00:55:32,875 --> 00:55:35,043
They might not come till the morning.

670
00:55:40,674 --> 00:55:43,427
If I hadn't brought us here,
none of this would have happened.

671
00:55:43,427 --> 00:55:46,263
It's not your fault. It's not your fault.

672
00:55:46,263 --> 00:55:48,390
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be sorry. Come here.

673
00:55:48,390 --> 00:55:51,268
- Sorry.
- Come on, it's OK.

674
00:55:51,268 --> 00:55:54,354
It's not your fault. No giving up yet, OK?

675
00:55:55,397 --> 00:55:58,859
Alright? Don't give up.
Don't give up. It's OK.

676
00:56:03,363 --> 00:56:04,823
OK.

677
00:56:06,492 --> 00:56:07,951
There. That's better.

678
00:56:13,999 --> 00:56:16,126
Now let's go find this first aid kit.

679
00:56:54,790 --> 00:56:56,333
Where the fuck is it?

680
00:57:20,524 --> 00:57:22,109
We're dealing with an animal, right?

681
00:57:22,109 --> 00:57:25,028
I mean, at the end of the day,
it's just a stupid animal.

682
00:57:25,028 --> 00:57:28,073
So, I was thinking, maybe
we could make some sort of a trap

683
00:57:28,073 --> 00:57:29,616
and have enough time to swim across.

684
00:57:29,616 --> 00:57:31,160
Jesus, mate.

685
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:34,496
The only way
we're gonna get off this bloody island

686
00:57:34,496 --> 00:57:37,457
is if someone turns up
with a rather large boat, you know?

687
00:57:37,457 --> 00:57:39,376
I just don't think that's gonna happen.
Do you?

688
00:57:39,376 --> 00:57:40,919
I know that's not gonna happen

689
00:57:40,919 --> 00:57:43,422
but the tide is moving in quick
and people are falling apart.

690
00:57:43,422 --> 00:57:44,965
We've got to do something now.

691
00:57:44,965 --> 00:57:47,301
Bait. We don't have any bait either.

692
00:57:47,301 --> 00:57:48,844
I know we don't have bait.

693
00:57:48,844 --> 00:57:51,555
If we could somehow hook the fucker
on this line with the anchor

694
00:57:51,555 --> 00:57:53,473
and keep it still for just a little bit...

695
00:57:53,473 --> 00:57:55,684
We can use one of the lifejackets
to help keep it afloat.

696
00:58:01,565 --> 00:58:05,903
Right. So, that's great. You wanna
go fishing? Oh, that's nice.

697
00:58:05,903 --> 00:58:08,238
Well, the results are in, Peter,
and you're a fucking genius.

698
00:58:08,238 --> 00:58:10,491
-Shut the fuck up, Simon.
-Well, mate, I'm sorry.

699
00:58:10,491 --> 00:58:13,202
Am I the only one who's noticed
what's going on here?

700
00:58:13,202 --> 00:58:16,830
I mean, there's an animal out there
and it's... it's hunting us.

701
00:58:16,830 --> 00:58:18,874
I mean, why is it still after us?

702
00:58:18,874 --> 00:58:20,709
I dunno.

703
00:58:20,709 --> 00:58:22,836
And it's... it's big.

704
00:58:22,836 --> 00:58:27,549
You know, and it's like... it's like
a fucking steam train with teeth

705
00:58:27,549 --> 00:58:31,345
and...and...and numbnuts here
thinks that we're gonna hold it back

706
00:58:31,345 --> 00:58:32,930
with that bit of dental floss.

707
00:58:32,930 --> 00:58:35,390
Just shut the fuck up, OK?
How much time do we have?

708
00:58:35,390 --> 00:58:39,561
- Um, maybe half an hour. At most.
- We've got a half an hour, OK?

709
00:58:39,561 --> 00:58:41,480
So we can either try and trap this thing

710
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:44,066
and... and keep it still
for long enough for us to get across,

711
00:58:44,066 --> 00:58:45,734
or we can sit here on our asses

712
00:58:45,734 --> 00:58:48,987
and in a half a fucking hour,
we'll be up to our necks in it.

713
00:58:48,987 --> 00:58:51,114
Fucking Americans.

714
00:58:54,368 --> 00:58:56,912
Yeah. Righto, mate. I'm with ya. Alright?

715
00:58:58,455 --> 00:58:59,957
We haven't got any bait.

716
00:59:14,263 --> 00:59:15,806
Yes.

717
00:59:15,806 --> 00:59:17,307
No.

718
00:59:19,309 --> 00:59:21,854
- No.
- No. I can't.

719
00:59:21,854 --> 00:59:23,355
- Yes, you can.
- I can't!

720
00:59:23,355 --> 00:59:25,566
- I have spent years fighting...
- I said no.

721
00:59:25,566 --> 00:59:28,110
..battling for one more year, one
more moment of knowing my daughter.

722
00:59:28,110 --> 00:59:29,153
I can't.

723
00:59:29,153 --> 00:59:30,863
- I haven't come this far...
- No.

724
00:59:30,863 --> 00:59:33,657
..to go down in some pile of mud
in the middle of nowhere

725
00:59:33,657 --> 00:59:35,450
because you're not prepared
to make a sacrifice.

726
00:59:47,504 --> 00:59:49,339
I'm not gonna let my daughter die.

727
00:59:52,259 --> 00:59:53,760
Oh, my God.

728
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:01,935
Wait. Wait.

729
01:00:06,273 --> 01:00:07,733
What the fuck's he doing?

730
01:00:13,572 --> 01:00:15,032
They'll eat anything, right?

731
01:00:16,116 --> 01:00:17,618
Hey?

732
01:00:37,012 --> 01:00:41,183
When we swim, you're to go first.
You're not to try to help me.

733
01:00:41,183 --> 01:00:43,393
But how are you going to cross?

734
01:00:43,393 --> 01:00:45,479
One of the others is going to help you.

735
01:00:45,479 --> 01:00:47,147
Well, what about you?

736
01:00:48,273 --> 01:00:51,276
I'll be fine, darling. Let's just get you safe.

737
01:00:54,321 --> 01:00:55,781
Oh, my.

738
01:01:06,542 --> 01:01:08,043
What do you reckon?

739
01:01:22,975 --> 01:01:24,476
Oh, shit.

740
01:01:26,937 --> 01:01:28,438
Need some help with that?

741
01:01:28,438 --> 01:01:31,275
What?

742
01:01:31,275 --> 01:01:33,235
Never mind.

743
01:01:35,863 --> 01:01:37,406
Here, give it to me.

744
01:01:43,495 --> 01:01:46,582
- You're good at that.
- Yeah.

745
01:01:48,041 --> 01:01:50,794
28 years old and I can tie a knot.

746
01:01:52,421 --> 01:01:53,964
Never been anywhere.

747
01:01:53,964 --> 01:01:55,632
Yeah, well, travelling's overrated.
Trust me.

748
01:02:02,514 --> 01:02:03,974
Here we go.

749
01:02:11,607 --> 01:02:14,485
- Who's gonna work the trap?
- Well, doesn't it just sit there?

750
01:02:14,485 --> 01:02:17,404
Crocs sense vibration in the water
through their skin.

751
01:02:17,404 --> 01:02:19,948
We need to keep the bait moving
so it thinks it's alive,

752
01:02:19,948 --> 01:02:22,576
otherwise it won't go for it.

753
01:02:22,576 --> 01:02:25,496
- I'll do it.
- No. You can't with your hand. I'll do it.

754
01:02:25,496 --> 01:02:27,915
- Have you done much fishing?
- Yeah. Once, when I was six.

755
01:02:27,915 --> 01:02:29,458
Well, nothing's changed.

756
01:02:29,458 --> 01:02:31,001
You watch the rope

757
01:02:31,001 --> 01:02:33,337
and the minute you see
that life preserver move at all,

758
01:02:33,337 --> 01:02:36,256
you let us know
and then get the hell outta here, alright?

759
01:02:36,256 --> 01:02:38,383
- I got it.
- And... and then what?

760
01:02:38,383 --> 01:02:41,303
Wait for it to take the bait,
then we head for the other side.

761
01:02:41,303 --> 01:02:43,347
Come on, let's go. Come on.

762
01:02:45,349 --> 01:02:47,267
You sure you wanna be
the last one across?

763
01:02:47,267 --> 01:02:48,727
No. Not really.

764
01:02:50,437 --> 01:02:51,438
Righto.

765
01:03:02,616 --> 01:03:04,076
OK, put that on.

766
01:03:05,285 --> 01:03:06,912
It's getting higher.

767
01:03:08,705 --> 01:03:10,499
This isn't gonna work, is it?

768
01:03:11,792 --> 01:03:15,504
If it doesn't, we're gonna
have to make a dash for it.

769
01:03:15,504 --> 01:03:18,799
So we'll stick together,
swim across as fast as we can.

770
01:03:18,799 --> 01:03:20,300
OK.

771
01:03:36,024 --> 01:03:39,486
I'm, er... I'm... I'm really sorry
about your husband.

772
01:03:39,486 --> 01:03:43,657
I... I can't imagine
what it must be like to, er...

773
01:03:43,657 --> 01:03:47,327
..to not have a chance to say goodbye.

774
01:03:51,999 --> 01:03:55,043
I've been saying goodbye
for the past three and a half years.

775
01:03:56,545 --> 01:03:58,172
We're getting ready to leave. Um...

776
01:03:58,172 --> 01:03:59,631
I can't swim.

777
01:04:00,757 --> 01:04:03,218
I'm not putting anyone else's life at risk.

778
01:04:03,218 --> 01:04:04,720
We...

779
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:07,556
If I thought there was good reason -
a year, even - I would.

780
01:04:07,556 --> 01:04:10,476
But there's not, so please
don't make this any harder than it is.

781
01:04:12,436 --> 01:04:15,147
Put this on
or you will be putting a life at risk.

782
01:04:15,147 --> 01:04:17,983
'Cause l... I'm not gonna
leave you here, OK?

783
01:04:29,411 --> 01:04:32,164
And you...you got a really good kid there.

784
01:04:53,894 --> 01:04:55,395
Come on, you fuck.

785
01:05:37,688 --> 01:05:39,982
Come on. I've got you.

786
01:05:55,956 --> 01:05:57,541
I love you.

787
01:06:21,356 --> 01:06:24,568
Crocs like the scent of dogs.
He should cross last.

788
01:06:26,028 --> 01:06:27,488
OK.

789
01:06:32,242 --> 01:06:34,036
Promise me you'll take care of him.

790
01:06:39,458 --> 01:06:40,959
Promise.

791
01:06:46,882 --> 01:06:48,342
Alright.

792
01:06:50,260 --> 01:06:52,262
Kate?

793
01:06:52,262 --> 01:06:54,306
- Do you still...
- Pete!

794
01:06:56,600 --> 01:06:58,977
- Go. Go! Get 'em outta here.
- Oh, shit.

795
01:07:01,980 --> 01:07:04,483
Come on, let's go! Let's go!
Come on, it's on!

796
01:07:04,483 --> 01:07:05,984
- OK.
- Get 'em in, mate.

797
01:07:05,984 --> 01:07:08,070
Yeah, right. You just get in there.

798
01:07:08,070 --> 01:07:10,364
Don't worry about your mum.
And swim like hell!

799
01:07:13,325 --> 01:07:17,162
Go. Get in there and go.

800
01:07:17,162 --> 01:07:18,831
That's it. Go.

801
01:07:18,831 --> 01:07:21,375
Go. Swim! Swim!

802
01:07:21,375 --> 01:07:22,876
Don't worry. I've got you.

803
01:07:25,879 --> 01:07:29,216
- Swim!
- Hurry! It's not gonna hold!

804
01:07:29,216 --> 01:07:31,176
Kate, move it!

805
01:07:33,303 --> 01:07:34,847
Come on! Hurry! Go!

806
01:07:36,306 --> 01:07:39,393
- You're OK, Sherry. Go!
- That's it! Go!

807
01:07:40,727 --> 01:07:42,187
Move!

808
01:07:43,397 --> 01:07:44,898
Kate, you gotta move it!

809
01:07:52,156 --> 01:07:54,158
It's not gonna hold!

810
01:08:06,003 --> 01:08:07,045
Mum!

811
01:08:07,045 --> 01:08:08,547
- Can you see Sherry?
- She's there.

812
01:08:33,030 --> 01:08:35,407
Kate! Kate!

813
01:08:35,407 --> 01:08:37,242
Kate, it's loose!

814
01:08:37,242 --> 01:08:41,121
I don't know where it is. Swim! Swim!

815
01:08:45,334 --> 01:08:46,877
Sherry!

816
01:08:46,877 --> 01:08:48,420
Wait!

817
01:08:48,420 --> 01:08:50,088
Go after them!

818
01:08:51,256 --> 01:08:53,300
Head upriver. We'll meet you there. Go!

819
01:08:53,300 --> 01:08:55,719
- OK.
- Go!

820
01:08:55,719 --> 01:09:00,599
We'll catch up with you.
Get outta here. Go! Go!

821
01:09:00,599 --> 01:09:02,059
Kate!

822
01:09:16,448 --> 01:09:19,034
Kate! Kate!

823
01:09:21,036 --> 01:09:22,496
Kate!

824
01:09:32,881 --> 01:09:34,341
Kate.

825
01:09:36,051 --> 01:09:37,511
Kate!

826
01:10:04,454 --> 01:10:05,956
Kate!

827
01:10:09,042 --> 01:10:10,544
Kate!

828
01:10:20,679 --> 01:10:22,181
Kate.

829
01:11:13,816 --> 01:11:15,275
Russell!

830
01:11:17,027 --> 01:11:18,529
Russell!

831
01:11:28,914 --> 01:11:30,415
Simon, wait up!

832
01:11:31,708 --> 01:11:33,168
Simon!

833
01:11:59,486 --> 01:12:00,946
Kevin, come here.

834
01:12:02,072 --> 01:12:04,575
Kevin, come here, you little shit!

835
01:12:04,575 --> 01:12:06,243
Kevin.

836
01:13:24,404 --> 01:13:25,405
Kevin?

837
01:13:34,748 --> 01:13:36,208
Kevin?

838
01:13:39,795 --> 01:13:42,214
Kevin?

839
01:13:42,214 --> 01:13:44,299
Kevin. Come here, boy.

840
01:13:44,299 --> 01:13:45,843
Kevin. Come on.

841
01:13:50,264 --> 01:13:51,723
Arggh!

842
01:14:22,796 --> 01:14:24,256
Jesus.

843
01:14:29,553 --> 01:14:31,096
Kevin.

844
01:15:08,217 --> 01:15:09,718
Kevin!

845
01:15:10,803 --> 01:15:12,846
Kevin, come here.

846
01:15:12,846 --> 01:15:14,431
Kevin!

847
01:15:28,362 --> 01:15:29,863
Kevin, come here.

848
01:15:34,618 --> 01:15:36,161
I said come here, you little shit.

849
01:16:14,950 --> 01:16:16,451
Kevin!

850
01:16:16,451 --> 01:16:19,079
Kevin! Kevin, get back here!

851
01:22:37,624 --> 01:22:41,086
No, no! No!

852
01:22:43,380 --> 01:22:45,632
No! Get out of here!

853
01:22:50,012 --> 01:22:51,638
No!

854
01:23:35,724 --> 01:23:38,227
Come on, you fuck! Come on!

855
01:25:16,366 --> 01:25:17,910
No.

856
01:25:17,910 --> 01:25:19,661
No!

857
01:25:24,917 --> 01:25:26,793
Hey! Hey!

858
01:25:30,297 --> 01:25:31,882
Hey! Hey!

859
01:25:56,615 --> 01:25:58,116
Hey!

860
01:26:02,079 --> 01:26:03,163
Oh, fuck.

861
01:26:49,334 --> 01:26:50,794
Arrgh!

862
01:30:32,516 --> 01:30:33,600
Thanks.

863
01:30:45,445 --> 01:30:46,488
Hey.

864
01:30:46,488 --> 01:30:48,615
Hey.

865
01:30:54,705 --> 01:30:56,582
What did you think of the tour?

866
01:30:59,459 --> 01:31:02,588
I was thinking I'm probably gonna
spend a little more time at home.

867
01:31:08,552 --> 01:31:10,053
Thanks.

* Never smile at a crocodile

869
01:33:20,017 --> 01:33:24,354
* No, you can't get friendly
with a crocodile

870
01:33:24,354 --> 01:33:28,275
* Don't be taken in
by his welcome grin

871
01:33:28,275 --> 01:33:32,237
* He's imagining how well you'd fit
within his skin

872
01:33:32,237 --> 01:33:36,366
* Never smile at a crocodile

873
01:33:36,366 --> 01:33:40,412
* Never dip your hat
and stop to talk a while

874
01:33:40,412 --> 01:33:42,456
* Never run
Walk away

875
01:33:42,456 --> 01:33:44,583
* Say goodnight, not good day

876
01:33:44,583 --> 01:33:48,879
* Clear the aisle
and never smile at Mr Crocodile

877
01:34:29,336 --> 01:34:33,340
* You may very well be well-bred

878
01:34:33,340 --> 01:34:37,177
* Lots of etiquette in your head

879
01:34:37,177 --> 01:34:41,265
* But there's always
some special case

880
01:34:41,265 --> 01:34:42,432
* Time or place

881
01:34:42,432 --> 01:34:44,434
* To forget etiquette

882
01:34:44,434 --> 01:34:45,978
* For instance

883
01:34:45,978 --> 01:34:49,439
* If you meet a sad crocodile

884
01:34:49,439 --> 01:34:53,694
* Who looks sad and lonely and mild

885
01:34:53,694 --> 01:34:57,322
* He's just hungry
That you can bet

886
01:34:57,322 --> 01:35:00,367
* It's the time to forget etiquette

887
01:35:00,367 --> 01:35:01,910
* Be careful

888
01:35:01,910 --> 01:35:05,455
* Never smile at a crocodile

889
01:35:05,455 --> 01:35:09,877
* No, you can't get friendly
with a crocodile

890
01:35:09,877 --> 01:35:13,672
* Don't be taken in
by his welcome grin

891

and stop to talk a while

894

Never mock
