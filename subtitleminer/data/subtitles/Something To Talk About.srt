00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:59,574
- Oh, my God!
- Don't do that!

2
00:00:59,661 --> 00:01:02,152
- Make a noise.
- You'll give me a heart attack.

3
00:01:06,042 --> 00:01:07,833
What's on the docket for today?

4
00:01:08,461 --> 00:01:11,462
Daddy's coming to the barn
for a meeting with me and Hank...

5
00:01:11,548 --> 00:01:13,291
...about the Grand Prix.

6
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:14,831
What for?

7
00:01:15,635 --> 00:01:19,633
He likes to grind us every year
about this time. Makes him feel in control.

8
00:01:20,557 --> 00:01:22,099
Where's the doodlebug?

9
00:01:22,184 --> 00:01:24,591
Getting dressed.
Caroline, what are you doing?

10
00:01:24,769 --> 00:01:27,605
- Can I ride?
- If we have time.

11
00:01:27,772 --> 00:01:30,264
Where have you been all night?

12
00:01:30,901 --> 00:01:32,230
Sleeping.

13
00:01:32,778 --> 00:01:34,271
Mom, am I gonna ride?

14
00:01:34,821 --> 00:01:37,775
If we have time.
Now, please, go finish getting ready.

15
00:01:38,325 --> 00:01:40,282
- Go, go.
- Quick, quick.

16
00:02:03,684 --> 00:02:04,847
Shit!

17
00:02:11,443 --> 00:02:12,771
I'm sorry.

18
00:02:13,819 --> 00:02:16,655
- I don't know what's wrong with me.
- You did it again.

19
00:02:16,823 --> 00:02:18,531
We'll find you a new mother.

20
00:02:30,087 --> 00:02:34,463
KING FARMS

21
00:03:08,584 --> 00:03:12,203
Harry, take the trailer to Mack's
to pick up Joe's Whimsy at 4:30.

22
00:03:12,297 --> 00:03:15,131
Sheila will ride with you,
help you get squared away.

23
00:03:15,591 --> 00:03:18,047
Tell Hank before you go, so he can be here.

24
00:03:18,219 --> 00:03:19,464
No problem.

25
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:22,176
Hey, Raymond.

26
00:03:28,104 --> 00:03:29,219
Good boy.

27
00:03:33,693 --> 00:03:34,855
Good morning.

28
00:03:39,699 --> 00:03:42,191
Caught you!
Were you trying to bribe Possum?

29
00:03:42,286 --> 00:03:43,614
Hey, Gramps.

30
00:03:44,287 --> 00:03:47,372
It'll make Miss Lily jealous,
and she'll dump you in the ring.

31
00:03:47,457 --> 00:03:51,325
You gotta save the treats
for the horse you're gonna ride.

32
00:03:51,962 --> 00:03:53,421
Please, let me.

33
00:03:53,589 --> 00:03:57,123
I don't want to ride a pony.
I want to ride a horse.

34
00:03:57,217 --> 00:04:00,053
- Hank says I'm big enough.
- Hold on.

35
00:04:00,554 --> 00:04:03,425
First of all, you can win on Miss Lily.

36
00:04:03,808 --> 00:04:05,966
You're gonna win on Miss Lily.

37
00:04:06,226 --> 00:04:08,896
See? See how strong my legs are?

38
00:04:09,563 --> 00:04:13,312
I must put you down.
Have mercy on an old man. Listen to me.

39
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:16,646
You must learn
to recognize your limitations.

40
00:04:17,238 --> 00:04:19,444
Gramps, why? I'm ready.

41
00:04:19,949 --> 00:04:22,440
I've been practicing. I know I can do it.

42
00:04:22,744 --> 00:04:25,281
Have you discussed this with your mama?

43
00:04:25,788 --> 00:04:29,038
You think I'd be here begging you
if she had told me yes?

44
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:33,455
Just put me on that horse,
and I'll win the Championship, I promise.

45
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:37,248
How come everyone thinks
they can tell me when I'm ready?

46
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,718
I'm supposed to tell you when I'm ready,
and I'm ready!

47
00:04:40,804 --> 00:04:43,342
I'm running out of patience
with you people.

48
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:48,967
Don't get all worked up.
Help Dub. Earn your keep around here.

49
00:04:49,062 --> 00:04:51,055
I gotta talk to your mama now.

50
00:04:52,274 --> 00:04:54,847
- Hank, how's it going?
- Great.

51
00:04:55,068 --> 00:04:57,524
- Grace needs to see you.
- Now?

52
00:04:58,322 --> 00:05:00,991
No, I must see her for a minute.
After that, okay?

53
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,480
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

54
00:05:07,414 --> 00:05:08,493
Hi, Daddy.

55
00:05:12,962 --> 00:05:15,369
Have A Heart went on the market
last week.

56
00:05:15,464 --> 00:05:16,495
Yeah.

57
00:05:16,715 --> 00:05:19,385
You know the one in California,
Jamie Johnson's horse?

58
00:05:19,969 --> 00:05:22,045
He won the Hampton Classic in September.

59
00:05:22,138 --> 00:05:26,005
- I know the horse. How much?
- $150,000.

60
00:05:26,559 --> 00:05:27,839
What's wrong with him?

61
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:30,936
Nothing. Jamie's selling
'cause of his divorce.

62
00:05:31,689 --> 00:05:33,350
Anyway, I bought him.

63
00:05:35,776 --> 00:05:36,808
You did what?

64
00:05:37,403 --> 00:05:40,607
I got a feeling about him.
I think it's going to be his year.

65
00:05:42,576 --> 00:05:45,410
He's got Grand Prix champion
written all over him.

66
00:05:47,539 --> 00:05:49,531
And I'm going to ride him.

67
00:05:50,834 --> 00:05:53,504
But, Daddy,
without even discussing it with us?

68
00:05:54,088 --> 00:05:55,545
There's nothing to discuss.

69
00:05:55,755 --> 00:05:58,044
- What about Ransom? Hank is-
- Mom!

70
00:05:59,968 --> 00:06:03,551
- Dub said I could ride Possum.
- Not now. In a minute.

71
00:06:05,014 --> 00:06:06,343
Ransom's not ready.

72
00:06:06,433 --> 00:06:08,639
I don't have the same feeling
about Ransom.

73
00:06:09,853 --> 00:06:11,976
You'll ride against Hank and Ransom?

74
00:06:12,982 --> 00:06:16,184
We won't enter Ransom.
He can wait another year.

75
00:06:16,276 --> 00:06:17,984
Daddy, Hank will quit.

76
00:06:19,947 --> 00:06:24,194
Here's a good opportunity for you
to utilize your people skills so he doesn't.

77
00:06:24,952 --> 00:06:28,403
- Hear me? You understand?
- You can't do this.

78
00:06:28,497 --> 00:06:30,241
- It's not fair.
- It's done.

79
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:32,666
Now, roll with it.

80
00:06:38,466 --> 00:06:41,135
Goddamn! Shit! Son of a bitch!

81
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:44,428
You watch that mouth now.

82
00:06:53,607 --> 00:06:55,764
- She can see you now.
- Okay.

83
00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:00,814
Goddamn it, I quit. I don't need this shit.

84
00:07:00,947 --> 00:07:04,233
- Hank, wait.
- I wish he'd die in a fiery car crash.

85
00:07:04,368 --> 00:07:06,609
I know. Get in line. Listen.

86
00:07:06,745 --> 00:07:10,410
No, you listen. I'm not sitting by
while he ruins my career.

87
00:07:10,499 --> 00:07:12,408
This is Ransom's year. This is it!

88
00:07:13,002 --> 00:07:16,251
- Give me time. I'll make him see reason.
- Like hell.

89
00:07:17,339 --> 00:07:18,798
You can't do this to me!

90
00:07:24,305 --> 00:07:26,261
Grace, is Daddy in there?

91
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:28,595
No.

92
00:07:29,518 --> 00:07:30,681
Wait up.

93
00:07:31,687 --> 00:07:34,724
I have a Charity League.
Did you know about this, Emma Rae?

94
00:07:34,816 --> 00:07:36,309
What? The horse thing?

95
00:07:36,775 --> 00:07:39,563
- Thanks for telling me.
- Check your machine.

96
00:07:45,701 --> 00:07:47,610
Grace, wait!

97
00:08:00,633 --> 00:08:02,092
God help me.

98
00:08:02,761 --> 00:08:04,754
I can't believe it.

99
00:08:10,727 --> 00:08:15,224
On to the business of our centennial
cookbook. We want it to be our best...

100
00:08:15,316 --> 00:08:18,814
...so I'll ask our committee chairman
to bring us up to date.

101
00:08:21,447 --> 00:08:22,645
Right.

102
00:08:25,034 --> 00:08:28,153
Deadline for recipe submissions
is the second.

103
00:08:28,787 --> 00:08:33,746
Think about substituting
vegetable shortening wherever it says lard.

104
00:08:34,085 --> 00:08:39,079
I say this because Nell McGee's husband
is recovering from heart surgery.

105
00:08:41,384 --> 00:08:44,883
Lucy's going to take over for me
until after the Grand Prix.

106
00:08:45,472 --> 00:08:46,799
That's it.

107
00:08:48,599 --> 00:08:50,639
- Names.
- Right.

108
00:08:53,772 --> 00:08:56,060
The committee thinks that...

109
00:08:57,525 --> 00:09:00,194
Well, we've looked at a lot
of other cookbooks.

110
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:05,566
We've always been listed
with our married names under the recipes.

111
00:09:07,994 --> 00:09:12,039
Frankly, the practice of excluding
our first names looks outdated.

112
00:09:12,332 --> 00:09:16,329
So, I think we should list our names:
first, middle and last.

113
00:09:16,586 --> 00:09:17,617
That's all.

114
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,675
I always thought the way it was
looked quaint.

115
00:09:22,968 --> 00:09:25,839
It doesn't look quaint, Edna.
It looks antiquated.

116
00:09:26,471 --> 00:09:27,716
What about tradition?

117
00:09:28,723 --> 00:09:33,018
If my name isn't there
as Mrs. Franklin J. Caldwell Ill...

118
00:09:33,145 --> 00:09:35,767
...then how the hell is anybody gonna know
who I am?

119
00:09:35,857 --> 00:09:39,307
Barbaranelle Caldwell, who's that?
It could be his daughter.

120
00:09:40,069 --> 00:09:41,860
- You wish.
- Shut up.

121
00:09:42,154 --> 00:09:46,732
Ladies, this isn't something
that's going to be decided today.

122
00:09:47,534 --> 00:09:51,996
If there's no further business,
this meeting is adjourned. Thank you.

123
00:09:54,167 --> 00:09:56,372
I'm proud to use my husband's name.

124
00:09:56,794 --> 00:10:00,377
The fact I'm still married to him
is one of my greatest accomplishments.

125
00:10:01,299 --> 00:10:05,878
Your mother called. She wants to change
the menu for the Grand Prix party.

126
00:10:06,178 --> 00:10:07,507
Why? Everyone loves it.

127
00:10:07,597 --> 00:10:11,677
She wants shrimp. She says
she's sick to death of ham and barbecue.

128
00:10:11,851 --> 00:10:16,429
They've been doing it that way
for 35 years. Why does it bother her now?

129
00:10:16,773 --> 00:10:20,640
Bring her over to my house
and let me give her some lunch.

130
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:21,892
Mom.

131
00:10:21,987 --> 00:10:25,819
I'm taking her to Miller's to be fitted
for her riding habit. I promised.

132
00:10:25,949 --> 00:10:27,776
Wonderful! Who you gonna ride?

133
00:10:27,867 --> 00:10:29,528
- Possum.
- Miss Lily.

134
00:10:30,954 --> 00:10:32,033
See you later.

135
00:10:32,706 --> 00:10:34,829
Is it because I don't have all my teeth?

136
00:10:35,459 --> 00:10:37,285
We're not discussing it.

137
00:10:38,837 --> 00:10:41,922
You have to wear them down.
'Bye, darling.

138
00:10:42,091 --> 00:10:43,502
- 'Bye.
- 'Bye, Aunt Rae.

139
00:10:48,263 --> 00:10:50,968
FIRST UNION

140
00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:08,868
- Why do buildings have stories?
- What do you mean?

141
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:13,904
Why do they say 20 stories
or 50 stories high?

142
00:11:14,499 --> 00:11:17,499
Good question. I don't know.
We'll look it up.

143
00:11:25,052 --> 00:11:26,511
- Hi.
- Hey.

144
00:11:41,068 --> 00:11:42,728
Mom, green means go.

145
00:11:46,616 --> 00:11:47,813
Bichon Partners.

146
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:50,110
Eddie Bichon's office, please.

147
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:52,912
Eddie Bichon's office.

148
00:11:53,372 --> 00:11:55,282
Hello, June. Could I speak to Eddie?

149
00:11:55,374 --> 00:11:57,580
Hi, Grace. He's not in.

150
00:11:57,668 --> 00:12:00,585
He said he'd be in a meeting
for the rest of the afternoon.

151
00:12:01,589 --> 00:12:02,917
Did he say where?

152
00:12:03,007 --> 00:12:06,590
No. If he calls in,
should I have him call you?

153
00:12:08,429 --> 00:12:10,468
- No.
- All right.

154
00:12:15,437 --> 00:12:18,353
The horse is being sold
as part of the divorce settlement.

155
00:12:18,439 --> 00:12:20,811
Dad's got him down to the low two's.

156
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:26,571
Dad wants me to go out to dinner
with clients, so I'll be home by 11:00.

157
00:12:26,907 --> 00:12:28,899
Kiss the doodlebug for me.

158
00:12:29,575 --> 00:12:33,574
Hey, Grace. It's me. This meeting
took longer than we thought.

159
00:12:33,872 --> 00:12:36,707
Dad wants me to go out to dinner
with these clients-

160
00:13:11,869 --> 00:13:13,696
That's Daddy's car.

161
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:21,579
Baby, wait here.

162
00:13:38,062 --> 00:13:39,438
You're busted.

163
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:43,891
- Hi, Daddy!
- Get in the car.

164
00:13:44,611 --> 00:13:46,106
Jesus Christ.

165
00:13:46,739 --> 00:13:49,490
Get your ass out here, now.

166
00:13:50,659 --> 00:13:52,319
Excuse me a second.

167
00:13:52,411 --> 00:13:54,285
- Call 911!
- Good luck!

168
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:03,081
- Is that your nightgown?
- We came to get you.

169
00:14:03,172 --> 00:14:05,924
Hi, tadpole. I'll put you in the car.

170
00:14:06,092 --> 00:14:08,843
It's way past your bedtime.
What are you doing up?

171
00:14:10,179 --> 00:14:11,756
Get in the car, Grace.

172
00:14:12,473 --> 00:14:13,967
Sweetheart, are you in?

173
00:14:14,267 --> 00:14:16,425
- Get in the car.
- No.

174
00:14:17,562 --> 00:14:20,728
Will you please get in?
You're making a spectacle of yourself.

175
00:14:20,815 --> 00:14:22,938
You are making a spectacle of me!

176
00:14:23,442 --> 00:14:25,685
What is wrong with you?

177
00:14:27,322 --> 00:14:30,073
- I saw you.
- What are you talking about?

178
00:14:30,366 --> 00:14:31,481
I saw you.

179
00:14:32,618 --> 00:14:36,237
The corner of Fourth and Union.
You know what I'm talking about.

180
00:14:36,331 --> 00:14:40,114
I saw you.
You were with a girl in a red suit.

181
00:14:40,209 --> 00:14:42,582
The same girl that's right in there.

182
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:46,206
Honey, I don't know
what you think you saw...

183
00:14:47,384 --> 00:14:49,008
...but that was not me.

184
00:14:51,554 --> 00:14:53,381
That's it? That's all I get?

185
00:14:54,641 --> 00:14:56,100
You're gonna stand here...

186
00:14:56,643 --> 00:14:59,216
...and lie to me in the middle of the street?

187
00:15:02,024 --> 00:15:03,055
What?

188
00:15:04,818 --> 00:15:06,396
What do you want me to say?

189
00:15:08,405 --> 00:15:10,563
I want you to say good-bye to Caroline.

190
00:15:12,868 --> 00:15:14,113
Where are you going?

191
00:15:15,621 --> 00:15:17,199
Home to Daddy?

192
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:22,288
Fuck you, Eddie.

193
00:15:29,176 --> 00:15:30,754
Kiss Daddy good-bye, angel.

194
00:15:33,264 --> 00:15:34,639
'"See you later, alligator. '"

195
00:15:35,308 --> 00:15:38,261
'"After a while,'" I meant, '"crocodile. '"

196
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:57,079
Is Daddy in trouble?

197
00:15:58,998 --> 00:16:00,541
Yes, baby, he is.

198
00:16:01,918 --> 00:16:03,329
Don't worry.

199
00:16:09,634 --> 00:16:11,710
He's in very big trouble.

200
00:16:49,592 --> 00:16:51,170
Oh, Lord.

201
00:16:53,304 --> 00:16:56,009
Well, this is just an unholy mess.

202
00:16:56,808 --> 00:16:57,888
And the timing.

203
00:16:57,976 --> 00:17:01,060
In the middle of this Wheeler Farm deal
with Eddie and his dad.

204
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:04,597
If you're expecting loyalty from Daddy,
forget it.

205
00:17:04,691 --> 00:17:05,854
I'm not.

206
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:08,565
Believe me, I'm not completely deluded.

207
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:12,067
I always worried
something like this might happen.

208
00:17:12,574 --> 00:17:17,367
If you were so goddamn worried,
why didn't you say something?

209
00:17:17,746 --> 00:17:22,538
What was I to say? You marry a guy
whose college nickname is Hound Dog.

210
00:17:22,626 --> 00:17:24,702
What did you think would happen?

211
00:17:25,629 --> 00:17:27,124
Oh, Emma Rae!

212
00:17:27,715 --> 00:17:32,127
Don't you think I feel like an idiot?
I'm out there on the damn street!

213
00:17:32,553 --> 00:17:36,254
What am I supposed to do? I mean, what?

214
00:17:37,558 --> 00:17:39,467
You did the right thing. You did.

215
00:17:43,564 --> 00:17:45,474
I'm proud of you.

216
00:17:51,572 --> 00:17:53,648
I'll kill the son of a bitch.

217
00:18:17,766 --> 00:18:20,470
- Jamie, good to see you.
- Good to be here.

218
00:19:00,393 --> 00:19:04,640
You better get it together.
Daddy will be here in 10 seconds.

219
00:19:09,568 --> 00:19:11,478
Come in.

220
00:19:12,155 --> 00:19:14,563
Hey, Daddy. Here's your schedule.

221
00:19:14,658 --> 00:19:19,568
Troutman auction's at noon. A meeting
with Mr. Yopp about the financing at 4:00.

222
00:19:19,704 --> 00:19:21,198
Don't be late.

223
00:19:21,956 --> 00:19:25,705
- What in sam hill's going on here?
- What are you talking about?

224
00:19:27,129 --> 00:19:30,711
To succeed in business,
you'll have to learn to lie better.

225
00:19:32,259 --> 00:19:33,587
Hey, Daddy.

226
00:19:37,181 --> 00:19:39,174
All right. I'm going to...

227
00:19:40,016 --> 00:19:42,305
...go see about some stuff.

228
00:19:45,898 --> 00:19:48,650
In your goddamn nightgown?
Is that part true?

229
00:19:50,736 --> 00:19:53,523
Is this how you behave
in front of your child?

230
00:19:53,614 --> 00:19:55,108
Daddy, please-

231
00:19:55,241 --> 00:19:56,700
You think you're invisible?

232
00:19:58,703 --> 00:20:00,494
We're having problems.

233
00:20:00,579 --> 00:20:03,664
Who are '"we'"? He wasn't
in his goddamn underwear, was he?

234
00:20:05,752 --> 00:20:08,421
How will going around naked
solve anything?

235
00:20:08,505 --> 00:20:10,876
You trying to humiliate your family?

236
00:20:11,299 --> 00:20:14,750
My God, her heart must be
in a million little pieces.

237
00:20:14,844 --> 00:20:18,973
No, her pride. Now, for God's sakes,
don't get maudlin.

238
00:20:19,641 --> 00:20:21,467
It's just so awful.

239
00:20:22,185 --> 00:20:24,759
- I can't believe Eddie would do that.
- I know.

240
00:20:24,854 --> 00:20:28,473
- What was he thinking of?
- The same thing he was thinking with.

241
00:20:29,026 --> 00:20:30,305
Don't be vulgar.

242
00:20:30,401 --> 00:20:32,026
Are spoons on the right or the left?

243
00:20:32,112 --> 00:20:33,523
- On the right.
- Left.

244
00:20:37,826 --> 00:20:41,824
I'm going back over there.
She's probably had all she can take.

245
00:20:49,171 --> 00:20:52,172
- You get her squared away?
- She'll be all right.

246
00:20:52,716 --> 00:20:55,207
- She say what happened?
- Just a fight.

247
00:20:55,511 --> 00:20:57,303
Eddie's fucking someone else.

248
00:20:58,556 --> 00:20:59,967
- That for sure?
- Yup.

249
00:21:02,685 --> 00:21:04,309
See you at noon.

250
00:21:06,314 --> 00:21:07,429
Hi, honey.

251
00:21:12,528 --> 00:21:16,692
Let's get caught up on these books
before it gets any crazier.

252
00:21:17,325 --> 00:21:19,365
Mother, please. Now's not a good time.

253
00:21:20,828 --> 00:21:24,032
Just give me the receipts
and I'll enter everything.

254
00:21:33,258 --> 00:21:34,586
Honey, he slipped.

255
00:21:35,469 --> 00:21:38,470
Please, I don't want
to talk about this with you.

256
00:21:38,806 --> 00:21:40,632
Just know that this happens.

257
00:21:40,723 --> 00:21:45,469
It happens in the best of marriages.
It doesn't mean that he doesn't love you.

258
00:21:48,524 --> 00:21:51,145
You have a daughter
who is crazy about her father...

259
00:21:51,234 --> 00:21:53,904
...and he's crazy about her, God knows.

260
00:21:54,363 --> 00:21:55,857
He slipped...

261
00:21:56,532 --> 00:21:59,735
...and, crazy as it may seem,
it's up to you to help him up.

262
00:22:01,203 --> 00:22:03,030
I don't believe I'm hearing this.

263
00:22:04,081 --> 00:22:09,076
You've gone about this in a way that'll
have everyone talking for a long time.

264
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:10,997
Let them talk.

265
00:22:12,631 --> 00:22:14,209
But, after this...

266
00:22:15,843 --> 00:22:19,343
...from now on,
let's make it a private family affair.

267
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,550
If you want to talk about anything...

268
00:22:25,144 --> 00:22:27,351
...come and talk to your mama.

269
00:22:33,277 --> 00:22:35,650
We can do these books another time.

270
00:22:40,494 --> 00:22:41,904
I love you, honey.

271
00:22:58,470 --> 00:23:00,463
- Eddie's coming.
- What?

272
00:23:01,097 --> 00:23:03,767
Daddy must have called him.
What do you want me to do?

273
00:23:03,851 --> 00:23:05,594
- Keep him busy.
- Okay.

274
00:23:11,191 --> 00:23:13,101
- Hi.
- Hi.

275
00:23:15,321 --> 00:23:17,064
- Is she here?
- Yeah.

276
00:23:19,701 --> 00:23:20,946
I'll get her.

277
00:23:26,332 --> 00:23:29,333
Grace, the lying,
cheating sack of shit is here.

278
00:23:29,836 --> 00:23:32,077
I can't breathe.

279
00:23:32,505 --> 00:23:34,083
Oh, my God!

280
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:36,258
What did you do?

281
00:23:36,676 --> 00:23:39,428
You said to keep him busy.
He's busy holding his nuts.

282
00:23:41,139 --> 00:23:43,594
- Are you all right?
- No.

283
00:23:44,976 --> 00:23:48,310
- Help me get him up.
- You stay the hell over there.

284
00:23:48,563 --> 00:23:51,233
Don't worry, I wouldn't walk that far
to help you up.

285
00:23:51,524 --> 00:23:54,276
God, Emma Rae,
what's the matter with you?

286
00:23:55,028 --> 00:23:56,855
Consider it a blow for your dignity.

287
00:23:57,239 --> 00:23:59,861
What's dignified about kicking someone
in the balls?

288
00:24:00,785 --> 00:24:02,194
I feel better.

289
00:24:11,878 --> 00:24:14,370
Grace, look...

290
00:24:15,257 --> 00:24:17,927
- I know-
- No, you don't know.

291
00:24:18,845 --> 00:24:21,631
You don't know what it's like to be lied to.

292
00:24:21,763 --> 00:24:25,180
You don't know what it's like
to be sitting there with your child...

293
00:24:25,267 --> 00:24:28,637
...while your husband is making out
with someone on the street.

294
00:24:28,771 --> 00:24:33,516
And you don't know how it feels
to be made a fool of in front of everyone.

295
00:24:33,609 --> 00:24:38,521
So, please, don't start with '"I know,'"
because you don't know!

296
00:24:40,367 --> 00:24:45,574
What I was going to say is
that I know I am 100% in the wrong...

297
00:24:46,539 --> 00:24:49,327
- ... and I don't blame you for being mad.
- What a comfort.

298
00:24:51,753 --> 00:24:55,003
I don't want this.
I don't want to be this person, this wife!

299
00:24:55,215 --> 00:24:56,543
Can you understand?

300
00:24:56,716 --> 00:24:59,753
I feel like an idiot.
What if Caroline had seen you?

301
00:24:59,845 --> 00:25:02,335
- Do you know how close she came?
- I'm sorry.

302
00:25:03,932 --> 00:25:05,557
I don't care if you're sorry.

303
00:25:06,977 --> 00:25:11,058
I'm not the kind of person
who can just let it go. I want you to leave.

304
00:25:11,482 --> 00:25:14,732
- Do I get to say anything?
- I'd really rather you didn't!

305
00:25:15,152 --> 00:25:16,777
Where is the doodlebug?

306
00:25:16,862 --> 00:25:19,436
She's not here. She's with Mother.

307
00:25:21,159 --> 00:25:23,281
You can't stop me from seeing her.

308
00:25:23,952 --> 00:25:26,526
I didn't know you were coming.
She's at Aunt Rae's.

309
00:25:26,622 --> 00:25:29,374
You want to see her, go over there.
I dare you.

310
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:33,876
Will you tell her that I love her?

311
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,924
- Whatever that means.
- Oh, Jeez.

312
00:25:58,071 --> 00:26:00,397
- Are you addressing me?
- Yes.

313
00:26:01,617 --> 00:26:05,994
Well, lick it, put a stamp on it,
and mail it to someone who gives a shit.

314
00:27:25,619 --> 00:27:28,288
Okay, just trot here. Warm up.

315
00:27:28,872 --> 00:27:30,865
- Hey, sweetie plum.
- Hey.

316
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:35,666
- Hey, Possum.
- Keep your mind on Miss Lily.

317
00:27:36,213 --> 00:27:39,084
- She driving you crazy over Possum?
- Nope.

318
00:27:39,717 --> 00:27:40,880
Keep her in a trot!

319
00:27:43,053 --> 00:27:45,924
- Looking good!
- Boring.

320
00:27:47,308 --> 00:27:48,933
Slower, just a tad.

321
00:27:50,186 --> 00:27:51,301
Hey, buddy.

322
00:27:52,896 --> 00:27:56,977
I've been waiting for the right time
to talk to Daddy about this, but...

323
00:27:57,986 --> 00:28:00,773
- If it was up to me-
- But it's not, is it?

324
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:05,690
Look, I'm not going to leave
before the event, so don't worry.

325
00:28:06,911 --> 00:28:09,581
But when it's over, I'm gone. Okay?

326
00:28:16,087 --> 00:28:18,080
That's a good decision.

327
00:28:20,676 --> 00:28:22,004
That's it.

328
00:28:23,136 --> 00:28:26,137
There's one. See your distance.

329
00:28:26,598 --> 00:28:27,974
Ride him into the base.

330
00:28:28,058 --> 00:28:30,134
What do you think I'm doing?

331
00:28:34,731 --> 00:28:37,057
Here we go. Missed it.

332
00:28:37,484 --> 00:28:40,320
It was right there.
Come back and make him jump it.

333
00:28:40,404 --> 00:28:44,069
Son, why don't you pipe down
and let me get the feel of it!

334
00:28:44,157 --> 00:28:46,613
I've done this
since you were in short pants.

335
00:28:47,119 --> 00:28:50,904
He knows what he's doing!
More than you do, you son of a bitch.

336
00:28:51,082 --> 00:28:52,113
Hey, Grace!

337
00:28:54,793 --> 00:28:56,252
I feel for you.

338
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:04,215
- Amen.
- Amen.

339
00:29:06,681 --> 00:29:09,516
- Where's Caroline?
- At school.

340
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:12,218
Must be missing her daddy.

341
00:29:15,314 --> 00:29:16,773
I'm sure she is.

342
00:29:18,610 --> 00:29:22,193
We're involved in a real estate deal
with Eddie and his dad.

343
00:29:22,406 --> 00:29:25,026
Emma Rae mention anything to you
about that?

344
00:29:28,203 --> 00:29:29,781
I'm aware of it.

345
00:29:29,871 --> 00:29:33,122
The Wheeler Farm project.
I'm very aware of it.

346
00:29:33,541 --> 00:29:38,085
It's uncomfortable for all of us
that you and Eddie are having problems...

347
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:42,296
...in the middle of what could be
a very lucrative situation.

348
00:29:44,302 --> 00:29:45,334
Yes.

349
00:29:46,305 --> 00:29:48,463
I talked to Eddie again last night.

350
00:29:49,475 --> 00:29:51,100
He wants to make amends.

351
00:29:51,936 --> 00:29:54,853
He's willing to do whatever it takes
to work this out.

352
00:29:57,483 --> 00:30:01,102
- The marriage or the deal?
- Don't get smart with me.

353
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:03,524
It's a legitimate question.

354
00:30:03,614 --> 00:30:05,903
- I'm talking to your sister.
- I know.

355
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,691
Just following along for the hell of it.

356
00:30:09,621 --> 00:30:13,784
Listen, honey, I'm not saying
he hasn't done anything wrong. He has.

357
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:18,201
But he's a good father and provider,
and that's not easy to come by.

358
00:30:18,671 --> 00:30:19,952
Then you marry him.

359
00:30:20,882 --> 00:30:24,582
Look, child, people have survived
worse tragedies than this.

360
00:30:24,719 --> 00:30:27,341
You're a grown woman
with responsibilities.

361
00:30:27,764 --> 00:30:31,133
If you can't work things out,
that's one thing...

362
00:30:31,226 --> 00:30:34,096
...but you haven't even tried,
and that I won't have.

363
00:30:35,188 --> 00:30:36,932
Do you understand what I'm saying?

364
00:30:39,276 --> 00:30:40,604
I think so.

365
00:30:42,321 --> 00:30:46,899
You're telling me if I just eat shit politely
with a knife and fork...

366
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:51,993
...and learn to swallow
the handfuls of bullshit he serves me...

367
00:30:52,123 --> 00:30:54,198
...then everything will be A-okay.

368
00:30:54,499 --> 00:30:57,370
Is that it?
That's what you're saying, isn't it?

369
00:30:57,461 --> 00:30:58,790
Isn't it?

370
00:31:06,428 --> 00:31:08,967
Nice going. You handled that like a pro.

371
00:31:09,724 --> 00:31:12,345
Watch out. I've had it with you.

372
00:31:19,192 --> 00:31:23,819
All our friends complain that
they never hear from their kids anymore.

373
00:31:24,822 --> 00:31:27,148
Why can't that happen to us?

374
00:31:36,709 --> 00:31:38,868
- You okay?
- Yes.

375
00:31:39,671 --> 00:31:42,756
I'm just so...

376
00:31:47,012 --> 00:31:48,672
What did I do?

377
00:31:49,139 --> 00:31:53,089
I was going to be a large-animal vet.
I only had a year to go!

378
00:31:53,352 --> 00:31:54,893
How'd this happen to me?

379
00:32:07,658 --> 00:32:08,986
What's that?

380
00:32:11,370 --> 00:32:14,288
- The Chi O Sadie Hawkins dance.
- That's right.

381
00:32:14,706 --> 00:32:16,830
Exhibit A. You asked him.

382
00:32:18,336 --> 00:32:19,616
What's your point?

383
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:23,876
My point is none of this just happened.

384
00:32:24,009 --> 00:32:27,044
Let's face it,
you weren't just hit by a truck.

385
00:32:28,721 --> 00:32:30,465
I have to go. Charity League.

386
00:32:30,932 --> 00:32:33,258
Another perfect case in point.

387
00:32:34,311 --> 00:32:37,347
I have a cookbook to put out,
a daughter to raise...

388
00:32:37,897 --> 00:32:39,475
...and the Winter Grand Prix!

389
00:32:39,649 --> 00:32:42,319
I don't have time
for the nervous breakdown I deserve.

390
00:32:42,486 --> 00:32:46,020
Please, don't ask me to stop and think.

391
00:32:47,824 --> 00:32:49,105
You're right.

392
00:32:52,162 --> 00:32:53,242
Forget it.

393
00:32:55,623 --> 00:32:58,079
I only asked him
because he was a good dancer.

394
00:33:01,046 --> 00:33:02,327
Shoot.

395
00:33:24,779 --> 00:33:27,234
Wait. Can I talk to you?

396
00:33:29,283 --> 00:33:30,861
I've been trying to call you.

397
00:33:31,786 --> 00:33:35,735
- What is it?
- I heard that you left Eddie.

398
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:42,294
- Well, Lorene, you know...
- You would tell me, wouldn't you?

399
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:46,164
If there was anything
that had to do with me, wouldn't you?

400
00:33:49,429 --> 00:33:51,967
Of course, I would.

401
00:33:52,641 --> 00:33:55,096
I'm so relieved. I knew you would.

402
00:33:57,020 --> 00:34:00,354
You know how Eddie and Tuffy
have always been so competitive.

403
00:34:01,316 --> 00:34:04,104
I was having a really hard time with Tuffy.

404
00:34:04,403 --> 00:34:07,072
I mean, he wouldn't stay put,
if you know what I mean.

405
00:34:09,908 --> 00:34:12,826
Nothing sparks a man's interest
more than competition.

406
00:34:12,912 --> 00:34:17,241
- Really?
- That's all it was, really. Just nothing.

407
00:34:18,333 --> 00:34:19,413
Really.

408
00:34:20,377 --> 00:34:23,165
If anyone wants to volunteer
for the Christmas bazaar...

409
00:34:23,256 --> 00:34:26,706
...they can sign up tonight
or call me by the end of the week.

410
00:34:27,176 --> 00:34:28,291
That's all.

411
00:34:28,427 --> 00:34:31,097
Thanks. Anyone else? Yes, Lucy.

412
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:36,848
If everyone would sell
at least 10 raffle tickets, that'd be great.

413
00:34:37,311 --> 00:34:41,144
If you don't think you can,
we need to know, so call me or Edna.

414
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,726
Thank you. And Grace.

415
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:49,524
I was wondering if anyone else here
has fucked my husband.

416
00:34:50,033 --> 00:34:50,946
Hello.

417
00:34:51,493 --> 00:34:55,656
Lorene told me how kind he was
to help her out by sleeping with her...

418
00:34:55,747 --> 00:34:59,745
...to try to make Tuffy straighten up,
so I was just wondering...

419
00:35:00,293 --> 00:35:03,544
...if this is a regular service
he provides to all my friends?

420
00:35:06,341 --> 00:35:09,176
- This isn't the appropriate time-
- I know that!

421
00:35:10,053 --> 00:35:13,802
It's not the time for me to tell you
your husband keeps half the hookers...

422
00:35:13,891 --> 00:35:17,057
...in town in high heels,
but I'm asking anyway!

423
00:35:17,936 --> 00:35:22,397
If there's anyone who, for any reason,
has had any kind of sex...

424
00:35:22,650 --> 00:35:25,568
...with my goddamn husband,
I think I have a right to know!

425
00:35:25,986 --> 00:35:27,266
You're losing it.

426
00:35:29,823 --> 00:35:30,903
I'll start.

427
00:35:30,991 --> 00:35:33,115
- Who do you think you are?
- Sit down.

428
00:35:33,619 --> 00:35:38,826
Kitty, did you know that Bill had an affair
with Dr. Davenport's dental hygienist?

429
00:35:38,916 --> 00:35:40,494
That's not true!

430
00:35:41,836 --> 00:35:46,213
Eleanor, you slept with George MacMurry
in Antigua. Lucy told me.

431
00:35:47,258 --> 00:35:50,129
- That's enough!
- I won't dignify this with my presence.

432
00:35:52,138 --> 00:35:55,721
Can't we be honest with each other?
You're supposed to be my friends!

433
00:35:55,808 --> 00:35:58,382
If your friends won't tell you the truth,
who will?

434
00:35:58,561 --> 00:36:01,135
I mean, who do we think we're kidding?

435
00:36:08,405 --> 00:36:10,694
Leave me alone! I want to be by myself!

436
00:36:18,081 --> 00:36:20,655
It was the best meeting
we've had in years.

437
00:36:27,090 --> 00:36:28,750
What are you doing?

438
00:36:28,842 --> 00:36:30,882
You almost busted up every marriage
we know.

439
00:36:31,387 --> 00:36:34,590
You can help them.
You're such a Good Samaritan.

440
00:36:34,682 --> 00:36:38,133
Oh, come on, Grace! We can't do this!

441
00:36:39,395 --> 00:36:42,182
Can't we just get some help, or something?

442
00:36:42,690 --> 00:36:45,644
George and Trudy went through this.
They got some help.

443
00:36:45,735 --> 00:36:46,932
They worked it out.

444
00:36:47,236 --> 00:36:48,564
Trudy's on Prozac.

445
00:36:50,323 --> 00:36:53,822
Well, don't we know any normal people?

446
00:36:54,285 --> 00:36:56,443
No one springs to mind.

447
00:36:57,955 --> 00:37:00,577
All right, Grace. What?

448
00:37:01,543 --> 00:37:03,334
Do you want a divorce?

449
00:37:04,713 --> 00:37:07,286
Is that what you want?
I'll do whatever you say.

450
00:37:08,466 --> 00:37:09,629
A divorce?

451
00:37:10,009 --> 00:37:11,338
Is that what you want?

452
00:37:12,387 --> 00:37:13,716
Is that what you want?

453
00:37:15,307 --> 00:37:16,337
No.

454
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:20,137
Do you want to go into therapy?
Tell me what you want to do.

455
00:37:20,353 --> 00:37:22,975
I don't know. You want
an answer right this minute?

456
00:37:24,441 --> 00:37:26,433
You call the shots, Grace.

457
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:30,860
You think you're high and mighty,
but let me tell you this:

458
00:37:32,658 --> 00:37:36,323
If I live long enough, and I will...

459
00:37:36,870 --> 00:37:39,955
...I'm going to pull you down
off that fancy horse of yours...

460
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:43,077
...and shove your face in the muck.

461
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,200
So help me.

462
00:37:55,014 --> 00:37:56,343
Better go.

463
00:37:59,352 --> 00:38:00,383
Hey, Jamie.

464
00:38:00,478 --> 00:38:03,515
- Is Grace here?
- Yeah, she is.

465
00:38:05,108 --> 00:38:06,815
Can I speak to you for a second?

466
00:38:20,123 --> 00:38:23,041
- What are you doing here?
- Sleep.

467
00:38:24,461 --> 00:38:26,371
It's late. Come back to bed.

468
00:38:29,174 --> 00:38:30,834
I want to sleep here.

469
00:38:31,885 --> 00:38:35,136
- You can see Possum in the morning.
- Let me stay.

470
00:38:35,222 --> 00:38:37,463
- I'll read you a story.
- I want to stay here.

471
00:38:38,266 --> 00:38:40,722
You're too big for me to drag around.

472
00:38:41,437 --> 00:38:43,975
- Say good night to Possum.
- Good night, Possum.

473
00:38:52,406 --> 00:38:54,565
- Mom?
- Yeah, baby?

474
00:38:55,326 --> 00:38:56,903
Are you gonna get a divorce?

475
00:39:01,749 --> 00:39:03,160
Oh, honey.

476
00:39:08,130 --> 00:39:09,506
My sweetie.

477
00:39:10,091 --> 00:39:13,840
Don't you worry about anything, okay?
Please don't worry.

478
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:16,297
Everything's going to be okay.

479
00:39:17,181 --> 00:39:19,589
All right? I'll work everything out.

480
00:39:49,214 --> 00:39:51,966
- Is she okay?
- Yeah.

481
00:39:53,177 --> 00:39:56,297
Thank you so much.
I didn't even know she was out.

482
00:39:56,681 --> 00:39:59,634
- I'm gonna hit the hay.
- Good night.

483
00:40:03,938 --> 00:40:06,180
She comes down every night
and visits Possum.

484
00:40:07,983 --> 00:40:11,020
- She's worse than I was.
- She's a great kid.

485
00:40:13,323 --> 00:40:15,992
I wouldn't talk
on that speakerphone anymore, though.

486
00:40:19,370 --> 00:40:21,992
- Jeez, I'm unfit.
- No, you're not.

487
00:40:22,457 --> 00:40:25,458
It's going through all this shit
that makes you crazy.

488
00:40:29,464 --> 00:40:31,373
How long were you two together?

489
00:40:32,175 --> 00:40:33,586
Ten years.

490
00:40:35,554 --> 00:40:38,803
Did you find you'd lost your ability
to think rationally?

491
00:40:40,392 --> 00:40:44,686
I'm here because of a custody battle
over a horse. Does that tell you anything?

492
00:40:46,232 --> 00:40:48,270
I think next time, I'd rather get shot.

493
00:40:50,277 --> 00:40:52,317
Don't sugar coat it on my account.

494
00:40:52,863 --> 00:40:55,235
- Do I sound bitter?
- Not at all.

495
00:40:57,326 --> 00:41:01,620
- How did you like California?
- Great, if you like natural disasters.

496
00:41:02,039 --> 00:41:04,115
My life is a natural disaster.

497
00:41:08,879 --> 00:41:10,373
Are you still up?

498
00:41:11,882 --> 00:41:13,792
Not technically.

499
00:41:18,347 --> 00:41:21,763
- That guy is so nice.
- Yeah, he is.

500
00:41:26,648 --> 00:41:29,221
I want to have him over for dinner.

501
00:41:30,193 --> 00:41:31,770
Is that weird?

502
00:41:32,278 --> 00:41:33,607
Why would it be weird?

503
00:41:35,907 --> 00:41:38,065
I don't know, you know...

504
00:41:40,161 --> 00:41:42,569
You have people over
for dinner all the time.

505
00:41:43,123 --> 00:41:47,453
You're the world's greatest hostess.
Why are you acting shy?

506
00:41:48,211 --> 00:41:49,705
I'm not.

507
00:41:50,797 --> 00:41:54,878
I think you should just give him a call
and ask him what he likes to eat.

508
00:41:55,636 --> 00:41:57,925
If he says, '"pussy,'"
tell him to come on over.

509
00:41:58,305 --> 00:42:01,092
Goddamn, Emma Rae, you are so vile.

510
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:05,681
Well, do something, will you?
Do something drastic.

511
00:42:06,105 --> 00:42:07,897
Yeah, like I haven't already.

512
00:42:12,403 --> 00:42:13,897
I'm going to bed.

513
00:42:15,031 --> 00:42:16,110
Good night.

514
00:42:30,463 --> 00:42:32,456
I know you're disappointed in me.

515
00:42:35,218 --> 00:42:39,002
No, for you, sweetie, not in you.

516
00:42:49,774 --> 00:42:52,265
Will you take some advice
from an old lady?

517
00:42:52,861 --> 00:42:56,230
You've got to take this bull by the horns,
so to speak.

518
00:42:56,615 --> 00:43:00,233
- Will you see him?
- We're supposed to talk tonight.

519
00:43:00,827 --> 00:43:03,153
- Where?
- Houston's.

520
00:43:04,289 --> 00:43:07,908
He wants to go somewhere
where he thinks you won't make a scene.

521
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:11,127
Deep in his heart,
he knows there is no such place.

522
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:13,828
Oh, no. You meet him at home.

523
00:43:15,092 --> 00:43:18,259
- And if I were you...
- What?

524
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:26,806
I'd make him something special
for his supper.

525
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:32,646
I think it's more complicated than that.

526
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:34,855
I'll say it again.

527
00:43:35,363 --> 00:43:40,605
Make him something special he won't
forget, ever. Here. Make him that.

528
00:43:43,037 --> 00:43:45,707
'"Poached salmon
with mint mustard sauce.

529
00:43:45,916 --> 00:43:48,074
'"Olive oil, honey, teaspoon... '"

530
00:43:49,919 --> 00:43:54,083
- My God, but this is-
- No, it's not lethal in that small dose.

531
00:43:54,299 --> 00:43:58,083
It will, however,
make him as sick as the dog he is.

532
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:02,056
You must tell him you've done it,
or it won't help.

533
00:44:02,557 --> 00:44:05,927
I always told Lloyd that
if he hit me where I lived...

534
00:44:06,270 --> 00:44:08,393
...he could expect the same from me.

535
00:44:08,814 --> 00:44:12,894
I just think of it
as homeopathic aversion therapy.

536
00:44:14,653 --> 00:44:18,982
Sometimes a near-death experience
helps them put things in perspective.

537
00:44:19,533 --> 00:44:21,110
Yes, ma'am.

538
00:44:22,453 --> 00:44:25,205
- Sugar?
- No, thanks.

539
00:44:28,918 --> 00:44:33,378
- Who's that Gramps is on there?
- That's Pride's Soldier Boy.

540
00:44:34,549 --> 00:44:37,122
That's when he won the Grand Prix.

541
00:44:41,097 --> 00:44:43,054
Why do you do that when Gramps rides?

542
00:44:43,725 --> 00:44:47,509
- Do what?
- Stand up and give that little wave.

543
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:51,186
It's just one of those things that happens.

544
00:44:51,607 --> 00:44:56,234
First time he came in there, he was looking
so handsome, I stood right up.

545
00:44:56,655 --> 00:44:59,146
Then it got to be kind of a tradition.

546
00:45:05,539 --> 00:45:06,784
Oh, God!

547
00:45:08,959 --> 00:45:10,583
- Hi.
- Hi.

548
00:45:13,714 --> 00:45:17,415
- What are you making?
- Salmon with mint mustard sauce.

549
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:21,093
- Salmon with mint mustard sauce?
- Aunt Rae gave me the recipe.

550
00:45:21,179 --> 00:45:23,849
She assures me it's unforgettable.

551
00:45:24,391 --> 00:45:26,349
Everything you make is unforgettable.

552
00:45:27,311 --> 00:45:31,011
Please, don't start trying to charm me.

553
00:45:31,190 --> 00:45:33,515
That's not what this is about.

554
00:45:33,776 --> 00:45:36,730
Want a drink? I'm getting a drink.

555
00:45:42,159 --> 00:45:43,784
I don't know what we're doing.

556
00:45:44,328 --> 00:45:45,823
What, this?

557
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:48,783
Oh, yes, you do.

558
00:45:49,292 --> 00:45:52,992
You know what this is?
This is the start of my punishment.

559
00:45:54,547 --> 00:45:56,587
I didn't come here to fight.

560
00:45:56,758 --> 00:45:59,758
You said you wanted to get together
to talk, so talk.

561
00:46:10,146 --> 00:46:14,096
I wasn't going to do this.
I wasn't even going to get married.

562
00:46:14,192 --> 00:46:16,351
Here it comes.
How many times will I hear:

563
00:46:16,445 --> 00:46:19,280
'"I wasn't going to get married,
I was going to be a vet'"?

564
00:46:19,365 --> 00:46:21,487
- That's right.
- Why the hell didn't you?

565
00:46:22,784 --> 00:46:25,358
Because, Eddie, I got pregnant, remember?

566
00:46:26,580 --> 00:46:28,205
Nobody made you quit.

567
00:46:28,791 --> 00:46:31,542
- Then why did you get married?
- Why'd you ask me?

568
00:46:31,668 --> 00:46:35,038
- Why?
- You're the one who's still dating!

569
00:46:35,130 --> 00:46:39,129
Honestly, Grace,
I didn't think you'd say yes.

570
00:46:42,805 --> 00:46:46,388
That didn't come out right.
Grace, that is not...

571
00:46:47,101 --> 00:46:50,185
- ... what I meant-
- I wanted to know.

572
00:46:59,281 --> 00:47:02,779
Do you think I wanted this?
Like I had it planned?

573
00:47:04,911 --> 00:47:08,411
Plan? The way you tell it,
you gambled and lost.

574
00:47:08,582 --> 00:47:10,574
No, that's the way you tell it.

575
00:47:11,292 --> 00:47:16,002
- I mean, I miss Caroline.
- You should have thought of that.

576
00:47:16,923 --> 00:47:18,501
Did you think about her?

577
00:47:19,093 --> 00:47:23,884
Tell me, what goes through your mind
as you're slipping it in?

578
00:47:24,514 --> 00:47:27,184
Will you stop it? Stop it!

579
00:47:28,602 --> 00:47:31,721
You won't believe this,
but I'm not happy either!

580
00:47:32,439 --> 00:47:35,357
Jesus Christ! Give me a break!

581
00:47:37,820 --> 00:47:41,438
They don't tense up when I touch them.
They don't stiffen up.

582
00:47:41,573 --> 00:47:43,032
What are you talking about?

583
00:47:43,117 --> 00:47:45,987
You know what I'm talking about!
You never touch me.

584
00:47:46,871 --> 00:47:49,029
- That's not true!
- It is, too, true!

585
00:47:49,666 --> 00:47:52,417
- When have you laid a hand on me?
- That's not the point!

586
00:47:52,710 --> 00:47:54,453
It is, too, the point!

587
00:47:54,628 --> 00:47:57,298
Maybe if you kissed me
the way you kissed that girl...

588
00:47:57,382 --> 00:48:00,087
- ... I'd be more inclined to...
- To what?

589
00:48:01,552 --> 00:48:05,004
To what? You can't even say it anymore!

590
00:48:05,139 --> 00:48:07,809
Don't lay that on me.
There's nothing wrong with me.

591
00:48:07,892 --> 00:48:12,803
I have orgasms every day. I've just
gotten used to having them without you.

592
00:48:15,817 --> 00:48:17,691
That's just great!

593
00:48:19,404 --> 00:48:21,811
That's exactly the point, Grace!

594
00:48:26,661 --> 00:48:28,286
What's happened here?

595
00:48:28,872 --> 00:48:32,537
Grace, how did we get this far gone?

596
00:48:35,420 --> 00:48:36,879
What happened to us?

597
00:48:38,424 --> 00:48:40,132
That's what I want to know.

598
00:48:41,176 --> 00:48:43,216
I've wanted to know for a long time.

599
00:48:46,849 --> 00:48:49,423
If you don't love me,
I wish you would just say so.

600
00:48:52,354 --> 00:48:53,979
I know I'm a disappointment.

601
00:48:55,149 --> 00:48:59,099
I'm a disappointment to myself.
Do you think this is what I want to be?

602
00:49:00,154 --> 00:49:02,775
I've done exactly what's expected of me
all my life.

603
00:49:02,948 --> 00:49:05,618
I work for my father and so do you.

604
00:49:06,119 --> 00:49:09,868
Look at us. We've both turned into exactly
what we swore we'd never become.

605
00:49:12,625 --> 00:49:14,534
We used to like each other.

606
00:49:15,461 --> 00:49:17,335
We used to make each other laugh.

607
00:49:18,506 --> 00:49:20,546
It used to be so easy.

608
00:49:21,843 --> 00:49:25,294
What happened to
Sunday under the covers...

609
00:49:26,681 --> 00:49:29,386
...dancing in the den
after Caroline had gone to bed...

610
00:49:30,893 --> 00:49:33,017
...and making love after two hours' sleep.

611
00:49:36,233 --> 00:49:38,356
Whatever happened to you wanting me?

612
00:49:40,905 --> 00:49:44,071
I mean, you know me.

613
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:47,027
I'm not one of those guys.

614
00:49:47,953 --> 00:49:49,613
I'm a decent person.

615
00:49:51,748 --> 00:49:54,915
You know me.
I'm the guy you fell in love with.

616
00:49:58,005 --> 00:49:59,548
You know me.

617
00:50:09,142 --> 00:50:13,435
- I've done something so wrong.
- Forget it. It's okay.

618
00:50:13,521 --> 00:50:15,846
It's not okay. I think we should...

619
00:50:17,901 --> 00:50:21,565
- I don't feel good.
- We should take you to the hospital.

620
00:50:22,405 --> 00:50:25,110
- There's something in the fish.
- There's what?

621
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:27,657
In the fish.

622
00:50:37,796 --> 00:50:39,540
Which hospital?

623
00:50:40,048 --> 00:50:44,046
We're almost there!
We're almost there! Oh, God, hold on!

624
00:50:45,387 --> 00:50:48,388
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

625
00:50:54,855 --> 00:50:57,393
Oh, my God.

626
00:50:58,901 --> 00:51:00,526
Look at you.

627
00:51:03,530 --> 00:51:05,357
Is he going to be all right?

628
00:51:07,743 --> 00:51:08,988
Oh, honey.

629
00:51:09,078 --> 00:51:12,078
I just don't know what's gotten into you.

630
00:51:12,664 --> 00:51:15,416
How could you listen
to that silly old woman?

631
00:51:17,712 --> 00:51:18,957
Come on.

632
00:51:19,464 --> 00:51:23,675
We'll clean you up. This is terrible.
We'll go to the bathroom.

633
00:51:25,344 --> 00:51:28,714
- Mother.
- Don't '"Mother'" me. You're a mess.

634
00:51:28,807 --> 00:51:33,598
Yes, I'm a mess. Look at me!
I'm an outrage, a disgrace, a failure!

635
00:51:33,895 --> 00:51:37,394
- Don't say that. You're not a failure.
- Yes, I am!

636
00:51:37,565 --> 00:51:40,401
I hate myself! I hate my life!

637
00:51:40,986 --> 00:51:44,319
I ignore my husband!
I drive away and forget my child!

638
00:51:45,657 --> 00:51:50,533
I have failed at all of it, Mother!
Eddie, myself, everything! Everything!

639
00:51:55,751 --> 00:51:58,586
Grace, you have to get a grip on yourself.

640
00:51:58,962 --> 00:52:01,039
This is not just about you.

641
00:52:01,382 --> 00:52:03,588
You have your daughter to think of.

642
00:52:05,010 --> 00:52:07,680
Is this what you want her to see? Is it?

643
00:52:07,972 --> 00:52:09,300
Honey...

644
00:52:10,016 --> 00:52:14,227
...you think I don't understand,
but I've had my troubles, too.

645
00:52:14,603 --> 00:52:19,100
It was a long time ago. I never said
anything, but I did want to make sure...

646
00:52:19,442 --> 00:52:23,771
...if you or your sister found out,
you'd be proud of how I handled it.

647
00:52:25,239 --> 00:52:28,157
Proud? Are you out of your mind?

648
00:52:31,037 --> 00:52:33,954
How the hell could we be proud
that you were oblivious...

649
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:35,617
...to what was going on.

650
00:52:35,708 --> 00:52:37,535
What are you talking about?

651
00:52:38,336 --> 00:52:40,958
Come on, Mom, please!

652
00:52:41,715 --> 00:52:43,125
You were right there.

653
00:52:43,424 --> 00:52:47,505
Mrs. Pritchett. Annie Pritchett.
You mean you didn't know about that?

654
00:52:48,388 --> 00:52:51,674
At least Caroline will see
that I didn't sit back and ignore it.

655
00:53:03,737 --> 00:53:04,768
Wait.

656
00:53:49,075 --> 00:53:50,404
Get a lawyer.

657
00:54:02,089 --> 00:54:03,499
LOW COUNTRY LOCKSMITHS CO.

658
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:27,990
Mother, something's wrong with the door!

659
00:54:28,407 --> 00:54:32,240
Nothing's wrong with the door!
Don't call me '"Mother'"!

660
00:54:33,412 --> 00:54:35,535
Then open the goddamn thing!

661
00:54:35,831 --> 00:54:37,539
Go to hell.

662
00:54:38,376 --> 00:54:40,748
Georgia, what's goin' on? Open the door.

663
00:54:41,254 --> 00:54:44,457
Go over and rap on Annie Pritchett's door.

664
00:54:46,843 --> 00:54:50,129
What are you talking about?
Have you gotten into the apple wine?

665
00:54:50,305 --> 00:54:54,136
I am talking about
your extracurricular activities!

666
00:54:54,225 --> 00:54:59,350
I am talking about your lying,
cheating extracurricular activities!

667
00:55:01,191 --> 00:55:02,851
I do not cheat!

668
00:55:03,025 --> 00:55:05,980
I may have fooled around,
but I never cheated.

669
00:55:06,321 --> 00:55:08,693
How could you do it?

670
00:55:09,282 --> 00:55:10,860
She was my friend.

671
00:55:11,368 --> 00:55:15,579
And don't think there weren't times
when I had thoughts, too...

672
00:55:15,664 --> 00:55:17,206
...because there were.

673
00:55:17,290 --> 00:55:22,416
But never once, not once,
out of respect for our marriage.

674
00:55:22,630 --> 00:55:23,874
What thoughts?

675
00:55:25,382 --> 00:55:26,662
Frank Lewis.

676
00:55:26,758 --> 00:55:29,250
- Who?
- Dr. Lewis!

677
00:55:31,472 --> 00:55:36,217
Do you know that after all of these years,
he still has feelings for me?

678
00:55:37,561 --> 00:55:40,349
He said that I have beautiful hips.

679
00:55:41,691 --> 00:55:45,771
Honey, I wouldn't hang any hopes
on something somebody said 40 years ago.

680
00:55:47,989 --> 00:55:49,483
Last week he said it!

681
00:55:49,824 --> 00:55:52,825
When I took Aunt Rae in,
I had my yearly physical.

682
00:55:52,911 --> 00:55:54,950
He said it last week!

683
00:55:56,789 --> 00:55:59,494
That's enough!
Goddamn it, open the door!

684
00:55:59,584 --> 00:56:02,122
I won't tolerate this disrespect!

685
00:56:02,963 --> 00:56:07,459
Don't you talk to me about disrespect,
you self-centered old goat!

686
00:56:07,550 --> 00:56:08,665
Self-centered?

687
00:56:09,052 --> 00:56:11,378
Haven't I given you
everything you've ever wanted?

688
00:56:11,596 --> 00:56:14,965
Do you think you would have had
this kind of life with Frank Lewis?

689
00:56:18,228 --> 00:56:22,974
The life I would have with Frank Lewis
would have included respect.

690
00:56:23,608 --> 00:56:26,099
My own daughters are ashamed of me.

691
00:56:26,570 --> 00:56:29,856
I'll tell you something.
I am ashamed of you.

692
00:56:30,199 --> 00:56:33,070
- Why?
- You are a humiliation!

693
00:56:33,702 --> 00:56:35,944
Our little girl's life has fallen apart...

694
00:56:36,038 --> 00:56:40,036
...and all you can tell her is
it's bad for business! You are a disgrace!

695
00:56:40,751 --> 00:56:42,210
You drink too much.

696
00:56:42,420 --> 00:56:46,037
And you laugh too loud at your own jokes.

697
00:56:48,008 --> 00:56:49,882
I'm going to tell you something:

698
00:56:50,219 --> 00:56:52,841
Wyly, you fart in your sleep.

699
00:56:54,181 --> 00:56:59,389
You do. I have put up with all of that
because it was part of you...

700
00:56:59,604 --> 00:57:03,139
...and I loved you
and I was proud to be your wife.

701
00:57:03,275 --> 00:57:04,982
But I'm not proud anymore!

702
00:57:05,234 --> 00:57:07,227
And if you attempt...

703
00:57:08,029 --> 00:57:12,193
...to walk across this threshold,
I'll call down to the barn...

704
00:57:12,409 --> 00:57:16,905
...and I'll have those boys come up here
and throw you out on your ass!

705
00:57:50,906 --> 00:57:55,235
You missed a really good time.
But you had quite a party yourself.

706
00:58:13,305 --> 00:58:14,846
Mama, I'm so sorry.

707
00:58:31,406 --> 00:58:35,569
After 38 years,
a little break will do us all some good.

708
00:58:35,910 --> 00:58:39,244
Is he still roaming around
out there in the yard?

709
00:58:39,581 --> 00:58:40,696
Yeah.

710
00:58:40,791 --> 00:58:43,199
Why can't he just go to a motel?

711
00:58:43,627 --> 00:58:48,585
It's a territorial thing, Mama.
He's probably out there pissing on trees.

712
00:59:18,830 --> 00:59:20,823
It's not fair, Possum.

713
00:59:21,499 --> 00:59:23,658
But next year, I promise.

714
00:59:44,189 --> 00:59:45,766
I wish I could help you.

715
00:59:47,484 --> 00:59:48,812
Me, too.

716
00:59:54,991 --> 00:59:56,901
I can get you drunk.

717
00:59:58,704 --> 00:59:59,735
Okay.

718
01:00:09,757 --> 01:00:12,758
'"Irreconcilable differences. '"

719
01:00:13,303 --> 01:00:17,631
Sounds better than, '"Nobody cares
anymore and we just want it over with. '"

720
01:00:17,765 --> 01:00:19,758
I'd say that sums it up.

721
01:00:21,311 --> 01:00:22,722
What would she say?

722
01:00:23,772 --> 01:00:26,938
She would say that I was cheating on her.

723
01:00:27,358 --> 01:00:28,521
Were you?

724
01:00:32,739 --> 01:00:34,399
Seeing anybody now?

725
01:00:34,783 --> 01:00:37,273
No. Absolutely, no.

726
01:00:38,453 --> 01:00:42,118
It's not as much fun
when your marriage is on the rocks, is it?

727
01:00:43,667 --> 01:00:45,244
Speaking of which...

728
01:00:45,835 --> 01:00:47,745
It never was much fun.

729
01:00:52,134 --> 01:00:53,545
Does she drink?

730
01:00:54,512 --> 01:00:55,625
No.

731
01:00:55,720 --> 01:00:57,630
Doesn't drink alcohol at all?

732
01:00:58,515 --> 01:01:01,089
Well, a glass of wine sometimes.

733
01:01:01,769 --> 01:01:03,014
Then she drinks.

734
01:01:04,856 --> 01:01:07,939
Don't write that down.
Grace is not a drinker.

735
01:01:09,818 --> 01:01:12,570
Was she drinking
when she made the attempt on your life?

736
01:01:12,697 --> 01:01:17,405
That was not an attempt on my life.
That was an attempt on my other life.

737
01:01:17,493 --> 01:01:18,868
What about your daughter?

738
01:01:18,953 --> 01:01:21,871
How will she feel seeing her daddy
every other weekend?

739
01:01:22,457 --> 01:01:24,865
Grace wouldn't do that to Caroline.

740
01:01:25,417 --> 01:01:26,580
Wait and see.

741
01:01:26,710 --> 01:01:30,127
- She'll use the kid against you.
- You don't know her.

742
01:01:30,339 --> 01:01:31,668
Wake up, Eddie.

743
01:01:32,467 --> 01:01:35,800
Divorces don't happen in church.
No guts, no glory.

744
01:01:35,886 --> 01:01:37,381
See what I'm saying?

745
01:01:38,931 --> 01:01:42,301
Yeah, I see what you're saying, Jack.

746
01:01:46,814 --> 01:01:50,231
This is a big mistake.
I'm sorry. I wasted your time.

747
01:01:52,696 --> 01:01:53,775
I'm sorry.

748
01:02:24,938 --> 01:02:28,721
Just act like I said something so funny
you're about to die.

749
01:02:34,280 --> 01:02:37,613
I'll sit here like I'm waiting
to zing another one in.

750
01:02:52,299 --> 01:02:55,502
- What's so funny?
- I have that effect on people.

751
01:02:56,803 --> 01:02:59,128
Listen, Grace, can you get a ride home?

752
01:03:02,476 --> 01:03:03,970
I got it.

753
01:03:04,687 --> 01:03:05,801
Thanks.

754
01:03:06,938 --> 01:03:09,429
I wouldn't let her drink any more.

755
01:03:10,943 --> 01:03:12,935
- See you tomorrow.
- Have fun.

756
01:03:18,325 --> 01:03:22,275
I don't know about you, but I've had about
as much fun as I can stand.

757
01:03:22,621 --> 01:03:24,910
Why don't we head on out of here?

758
01:04:01,202 --> 01:04:02,911
Is this where you wanted to go?

759
01:04:04,081 --> 01:04:05,160
No.

760
01:04:06,708 --> 01:04:09,744
Well, where did you want to go?

761
01:04:13,173 --> 01:04:16,091
I don't know.
I don't really feel like going home yet.

762
01:04:25,436 --> 01:04:28,105
- I'd invite you to my place for a nightcap-
- Okay.

763
01:04:31,317 --> 01:04:32,348
Okay.

764
01:04:39,199 --> 01:04:41,607
I haven't been here for a long time.

765
01:04:42,870 --> 01:04:46,536
- I wasn't expecting company.
- Everything looks smaller.

766
01:04:48,709 --> 01:04:52,328
It's close quarters in here. Want a drink?

767
01:04:52,839 --> 01:04:53,870
Yeah.

768
01:04:56,092 --> 01:04:58,879
God, I used to play in here
when I was little.

769
01:04:59,595 --> 01:05:02,169
Some glasses here, somewhere.

770
01:05:05,477 --> 01:05:06,970
Then later...

771
01:05:11,024 --> 01:05:13,100
...I lost something in here.

772
01:05:18,490 --> 01:05:21,491
I was 16. Or 15? No, 16.

773
01:05:22,244 --> 01:05:25,827
The year I rode Miracle Child
in the National.

774
01:05:27,791 --> 01:05:31,789
He was here with his parents.
Everybody was away at the auction.

775
01:05:33,547 --> 01:05:37,331
- Would you like another drink?
- Yeah. Thank you.

776
01:05:37,467 --> 01:05:40,469
God, I remember I was so nervous.

777
01:05:43,391 --> 01:05:46,427
I was standing right in this very spot...

778
01:05:47,644 --> 01:05:50,396
...with my back to him,
looking out the window.

779
01:05:51,983 --> 01:05:55,186
I wanted something to happen,
but I didn't know what to do...

780
01:05:55,653 --> 01:05:58,570
...or say, so I just stood here...

781
01:06:00,366 --> 01:06:01,825
...hoping and waiting...

782
01:06:03,286 --> 01:06:04,911
...for him to make his move.

783
01:06:14,131 --> 01:06:15,293
And?

784
01:06:17,216 --> 01:06:19,043
And finally he did.

785
01:06:28,103 --> 01:06:29,431
Sorry, sorry.

786
01:06:39,448 --> 01:06:41,357
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

787
01:06:43,702 --> 01:06:45,861
Damn you, Eddie! Damn you!

788
01:06:47,497 --> 01:06:51,827
I have nothing to feel guilty about.
I wasn't the one who was unfaithful.

789
01:06:52,628 --> 01:06:55,499
- Am I right?
- Right.

790
01:06:59,677 --> 01:07:04,007
I want to do this. I really want to.

791
01:07:13,358 --> 01:07:14,521
Yes.

792
01:07:14,651 --> 01:07:18,351
It figures that the one time
I want to do this...

793
01:07:18,446 --> 01:07:20,771
...you'd find a way to take the fun out of it.

794
01:07:21,241 --> 01:07:24,408
I'm not doing this for revenge!
You are not for revenge.

795
01:07:24,494 --> 01:07:27,033
- Let's get that straight.
- Okay.

796
01:07:27,414 --> 01:07:29,572
That's not what's going on here.

797
01:07:32,169 --> 01:07:34,874
What is going on here?

798
01:07:35,589 --> 01:07:37,499
I have absolutely no idea.

799
01:07:39,634 --> 01:07:40,714
Come here.

800
01:07:42,971 --> 01:07:44,430
This is crazy.

801
01:07:44,807 --> 01:07:47,559
It's crazy. I've been wanting to do this.

802
01:07:49,603 --> 01:07:51,845
I can't believe I'm about to say this.

803
01:07:52,815 --> 01:07:54,013
You're not ready.

804
01:07:54,108 --> 01:07:55,768
- Yes, I am.
- No, you're not.

805
01:07:57,028 --> 01:07:59,779
Face the facts. You've got a broken heart.

806
01:07:59,863 --> 01:08:01,358
Deal with it.

807
01:08:03,534 --> 01:08:08,196
I don't want to be this crazy thing
you did one night.

808
01:08:10,541 --> 01:08:11,870
Oh, shit.

809
01:08:17,257 --> 01:08:18,715
If we don't do this,
what do you want to do?

810
01:08:20,923 --> 01:08:22,121
Oh, God.

811
01:08:28,680 --> 01:08:30,258
I'll say one thing:

812
01:08:30,641 --> 01:08:32,966
You Southern women
sure are easy to please.

813
01:08:34,604 --> 01:08:38,304
Comes from centuries of being bred
to keep our expectations low.

814
01:08:49,827 --> 01:08:51,369
Wait a second.

815
01:08:59,837 --> 01:09:02,245
Caroline, wake up.
I have to tell you something.

816
01:09:03,550 --> 01:09:05,875
Baby, you'll ride Possum, okay?

817
01:09:06,970 --> 01:09:08,630
Did you hear me?

818
01:09:09,639 --> 01:09:12,474
No, not right now. Tomorrow, sweetie.

819
01:09:14,394 --> 01:09:15,972
Do you know I love you?

820
01:09:18,232 --> 01:09:19,262
Yeah.

821
01:09:19,441 --> 01:09:22,062
- Good night, my sweetie.
- Good night.

822
01:09:32,287 --> 01:09:33,319
Yes!

823
01:09:45,259 --> 01:09:49,968
Crown Royal Winter
NATIONAL GRAND PRIX

824
01:10:15,916 --> 01:10:19,960
He tends to back off on the first fence.
Keep him in front of your leg.

825
01:10:20,044 --> 01:10:23,580
Keep him in front. Trot him to the end.
Let him see the course.

826
01:10:23,882 --> 01:10:26,373
- Hey, bug.
- Hey, Daddy.

827
01:10:31,306 --> 01:10:33,679
- You look like a winner.
- I do?

828
01:10:38,439 --> 01:10:39,719
Hi, Eddie.

829
01:10:40,858 --> 01:10:43,563
- Ready to go, Caroline?
- Come on, Daddy!

830
01:10:44,028 --> 01:10:45,653
I'm right behind you.

831
01:10:54,413 --> 01:10:58,827
You'll feel him go into it,
so just support him at the vertical.

832
01:10:59,293 --> 01:11:01,784
- Ladybug, I'll go watch.
- Okay.

833
01:11:02,338 --> 01:11:03,880
- Have fun.
- All right.

834
01:11:05,592 --> 01:11:09,636
Stay really focused.
Listen to what Hank says.

835
01:11:09,804 --> 01:11:14,051
Mom, just go in and watch.
I want to do this by myself, please?

836
01:11:15,977 --> 01:11:18,551
- I love you.
- I love you.

837
01:12:04,861 --> 01:12:09,108
A great effort, but a disappointing
four faults within the time allowed...

838
01:12:09,199 --> 01:12:13,860
...for number 184,
our defending champion, Amanda Forte.

839
01:12:15,288 --> 01:12:16,486
It's time.

840
01:12:16,581 --> 01:12:20,993
Our last exhibitor
in our $2,500 Youth Jumper Classic...

841
01:12:21,210 --> 01:12:24,829
...is number 170, Caroline Bichon...

842
01:12:24,923 --> 01:12:29,834
...riding Silver Bells, affectionately
known to most of you as Possum.

843
01:12:30,303 --> 01:12:33,304
Possum is a thoroughbred gelding...

844
01:12:33,390 --> 01:12:37,435
...who here in 1981,
with Emma Rae King riding...

845
01:12:37,686 --> 01:12:40,687
...was our amateur
Jumper Classic champion.

846
01:12:40,939 --> 01:12:44,189
Ladies and gentlemen, here's Silver Bells!

847
01:12:45,736 --> 01:12:47,729
Don't forget to breathe.

848
01:13:09,927 --> 01:13:10,958
Come on.

849
01:13:37,372 --> 01:13:39,164
That's it. Don't override him.

850
01:13:45,255 --> 01:13:46,287
Yes.

851
01:13:53,555 --> 01:13:58,301
A clean ride for Caroline Bichon,
number 170.

852
01:13:58,436 --> 01:14:00,178
Good going, young lady.

853
01:14:00,270 --> 01:14:03,307
There you go, honey.
There's your accomplishment.

854
01:14:04,108 --> 01:14:06,314
It's her accomplishment, Mama, not mine.

855
01:14:08,488 --> 01:14:10,693
Carrying on that family tradition.

856
01:14:10,781 --> 01:14:13,616
First Place goes to number 170...

857
01:14:15,536 --> 01:14:18,787
...Caroline Bichon, riding Silver Bells.

858
01:14:21,959 --> 01:14:23,619
That's my granddaughter.

859
01:14:33,429 --> 01:14:37,759
Let's have a round of applause
as our riders take their victory gallop.

860
01:14:51,614 --> 01:14:55,660
Mama gave me this the first time I won
in my 14-and-under class.

861
01:14:56,078 --> 01:14:57,786
Thanks for letting me ride him.

862
01:14:58,205 --> 01:14:59,320
Sure, sweetie.

863
01:15:02,125 --> 01:15:03,157
Daddy.

864
01:15:07,381 --> 01:15:09,504
- You were great!
- It was so fun!

865
01:15:09,592 --> 01:15:11,216
Caroline, come over here.

866
01:15:15,639 --> 01:15:17,050
This is my granddaughter.

867
01:15:23,564 --> 01:15:25,723
- Pretty great.
- She was incredible.

868
01:15:26,401 --> 01:15:28,939
- You see how she just knew?
- Yeah, I did.

869
01:15:31,572 --> 01:15:36,116
You know, it's hard not seeing her.

870
01:15:38,121 --> 01:15:39,615
She misses you, too.

871
01:15:42,792 --> 01:15:45,200
Why doesn't she go home
with you tonight?

872
01:15:46,463 --> 01:15:48,420
- Really?
- Yeah.

873
01:15:49,967 --> 01:15:52,255
She wants to see Daddy ride tomorrow.

874
01:15:53,094 --> 01:15:55,217
I'll have her back to you in the morning.

875
01:15:57,724 --> 01:16:00,560
Why don't you just bring her to the show?

876
01:16:01,436 --> 01:16:02,467
Okay.

877
01:16:04,815 --> 01:16:06,013
Thanks.

878
01:16:08,986 --> 01:16:11,274
- 'Bye.
- 'Bye.

879
01:16:16,368 --> 01:16:19,904
- Where's your mother? Where's Grace?
- She's busy.

880
01:16:20,039 --> 01:16:21,414
All right, here we go.

881
01:16:21,623 --> 01:16:23,118
One, two, three.

882
01:16:28,631 --> 01:16:30,291
Hank, come here!

883
01:16:34,595 --> 01:16:36,090
What's wrong with Hank?

884
01:16:37,015 --> 01:16:39,007
You're the only one who loves me today.

885
01:16:39,100 --> 01:16:41,804
- You love me?
- I love you.

886
01:16:41,894 --> 01:16:43,887
My peanut loves me.

887
01:16:54,532 --> 01:16:56,240
I want to talk to you.

888
01:16:58,245 --> 01:17:00,451
Just a little drop now.

889
01:17:01,664 --> 01:17:02,909
More.

890
01:17:05,210 --> 01:17:07,119
Just a skosh more.

891
01:17:07,880 --> 01:17:09,540
Keep going.

892
01:17:10,257 --> 01:17:11,632
There.

893
01:17:13,051 --> 01:17:15,969
- I could use one of those.
- Here, Ma.

894
01:17:44,500 --> 01:17:47,834
Thank you for coming out
in the middle of the night.

895
01:18:04,646 --> 01:18:07,137
- Doc, she okay?
- Yeah.

896
01:18:07,733 --> 01:18:11,730
You get to be that age,
you get a little excited...

897
01:18:12,362 --> 01:18:14,687
...you drink a little too much punch...

898
01:18:15,115 --> 01:18:18,449
She's fine. She'll probably outlast us all.

899
01:18:18,786 --> 01:18:20,446
That's good. That's wonderful.

900
01:18:20,538 --> 01:18:24,487
Now, you call me if you need to
and good luck tomorrow night.

901
01:18:25,375 --> 01:18:26,621
- Doc?
- Yeah.

902
01:18:27,002 --> 01:18:28,627
Let me ask you something.

903
01:18:33,759 --> 01:18:35,716
Did you say she had beautiful hips?

904
01:18:40,141 --> 01:18:41,422
Yes, I did.

905
01:18:41,892 --> 01:18:43,386
I meant for...

906
01:18:44,854 --> 01:18:46,514
Well, she has.

907
01:18:53,070 --> 01:18:54,862
Stop it, Daddy!

908
01:18:59,744 --> 01:19:01,737
It's all right. I boxed in the Navy.

909
01:19:01,830 --> 01:19:04,036
I wrestled in high school.

910
01:19:25,103 --> 01:19:26,811
- Drive carefully.
- Thanks a lot.

911
01:19:34,571 --> 01:19:37,193
That no-good son of a bitch.

912
01:19:37,533 --> 01:19:40,700
Come on, Daddy.
There's more ass to kick tomorrow.

913
01:19:40,912 --> 01:19:43,283
You can rack out at my house tonight.

914
01:19:45,416 --> 01:19:48,251
You've been sleeping in the barn too long.

915
01:19:49,295 --> 01:19:51,584
Can't even sleep in my own goddamn bed.

916
01:19:53,966 --> 01:19:57,382
- I talked to Hank.
- You got him all squared away?

917
01:19:57,804 --> 01:20:00,556
- Good. He's not going to quit?
- No.

918
01:20:01,016 --> 01:20:03,802
- Good.
- He's going to ride Ransom.

919
01:20:04,352 --> 01:20:05,383
What?

920
01:20:06,729 --> 01:20:09,684
Now how can you say
a fool thing like that?

921
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:12,227
It's the right thing to do.

922
01:20:16,823 --> 01:20:19,860
The right thing is I'll do exactly
with my goddamn horses...

923
01:20:19,952 --> 01:20:21,861
...as I goddamn please.

924
01:20:23,455 --> 01:20:25,079
Hank will ride.

925
01:20:29,253 --> 01:20:33,831
Baby, why do you think I been doing this
for all these years? My health?

926
01:20:35,467 --> 01:20:37,590
Don't you have a loyal bone in your body?

927
01:20:39,013 --> 01:20:43,508
I'd love to see you win,
but you'll have to do it fair and square.

928
01:20:44,017 --> 01:20:45,049
Wait a minute.

929
01:20:45,185 --> 01:20:47,890
The stable manager is telling the owner
what to do?

930
01:20:49,148 --> 01:20:50,263
No.

931
01:20:51,567 --> 01:20:52,765
I quit.

932
01:20:54,820 --> 01:20:56,778
I'm going back to finish vet school.

933
01:20:57,073 --> 01:20:59,944
Oh, she quit. Well, I'll be damned.

934
01:21:00,618 --> 01:21:03,239
I'm telling you this as me.

935
01:21:11,254 --> 01:21:12,665
I understand.

936
01:21:28,897 --> 01:21:30,391
Come on, Grace.

937
01:21:33,943 --> 01:21:35,604
Didn't that feel good?

938
01:21:38,615 --> 01:21:40,941
You girls, I swear.

939
01:21:45,581 --> 01:21:49,709
Ladies and gentlemen,
we are setting up for our final event:

940
01:21:50,044 --> 01:21:52,167
The $100,000...

941
01:21:52,255 --> 01:21:55,753
...Crown Royal Winter National
Grand Prix Jump-off.

942
01:21:56,216 --> 01:21:58,755
Our ring crew is raising the fences...

943
01:21:59,011 --> 01:22:02,048
...and shortening the course
for our final round.

944
01:22:05,768 --> 01:22:06,966
- Daddy?
- Yeah.

945
01:22:07,103 --> 01:22:09,772
Can I go and see Ma?
She's right over there.

946
01:22:12,817 --> 01:22:13,848
Please.

947
01:22:14,610 --> 01:22:16,568
Okay, go see your mommy.

948
01:22:21,451 --> 01:22:23,858
- Stay with your mommy.
- Okay, I will.

949
01:22:26,122 --> 01:22:27,782
Honey, I'll walk you.

950
01:22:33,504 --> 01:22:38,333
Have a Heart, trained by James Johnson,
is a top West Coast competitor.

951
01:22:39,011 --> 01:22:41,253
You know Eddie, I had a flash.

952
01:22:42,223 --> 01:22:43,930
I'll alert the media.

953
01:22:44,516 --> 01:22:47,968
I'll bet that one day you and Grace
will make fantastic grownups.

954
01:22:53,942 --> 01:22:56,184
- Want a drink?
- Sure.

955
01:22:56,278 --> 01:22:58,354
I'll go get something to drink.

956
01:23:05,621 --> 01:23:07,246
Ladies and gentlemen...

957
01:23:07,331 --> 01:23:11,080
...let's begin with our first rider,
number 232...

958
01:23:11,210 --> 01:23:13,879
...Mary Ting, riding Monte Carlo.

959
01:23:39,573 --> 01:23:44,068
Mary Ting on Monte Carlo
with one rail down and a time of 36:07.

960
01:23:44,577 --> 01:23:49,536
Now, number 208, King's Ransom,
of King Farms, Wyly King, owner...

961
01:23:49,625 --> 01:23:51,249
Give him the ride of his life.

962
01:23:51,543 --> 01:23:53,335
...ridden by Hank Corrigan.

963
01:23:53,421 --> 01:23:56,207
Ladies and gentlemen, King's Ransom.

964
01:24:24,285 --> 01:24:27,701
That's a clean ride for King's Ransom,
number 208...

965
01:24:27,789 --> 01:24:31,703
...Hank Corrigan with a time of 35:58.

966
01:24:38,174 --> 01:24:39,752
- Good ride, son.
- Thanks.

967
01:24:43,305 --> 01:24:45,795
And now, our final competitor.

968
01:24:47,058 --> 01:24:48,221
Good luck, Daddy.

969
01:24:49,561 --> 01:24:52,183
There's no luck to it. It's all skill.

970
01:25:06,119 --> 01:25:07,697
Oh, my God.

971
01:25:08,205 --> 01:25:11,409
It's just a man on a horse,
baby girl, nothing more.

972
01:25:11,500 --> 01:25:13,493
Just a man on a horse.

973
01:25:54,044 --> 01:25:57,662
Unfortunately, number 226, Wyly King...

974
01:25:57,923 --> 01:26:02,918
...had the last rail down on
that difficult triple, with a time of 36:18.

975
01:26:03,554 --> 01:26:06,803
That moves Wyly King
and Have A Heart into third place.

976
01:26:08,809 --> 01:26:13,021
But still a win for King Farms
with number 208...

977
01:26:13,356 --> 01:26:17,768
...King's Ransom,
becoming this year's $100,000...

978
01:26:17,860 --> 01:26:21,229
...Crown Royal Winter
National Grand Prix champion!

979
01:26:39,799 --> 01:26:41,708
Good job, Ransom!

980
01:27:17,212 --> 01:27:19,454
It's not about the horses.

981
01:27:21,175 --> 01:27:22,420
Come on, honey.

982
01:27:23,427 --> 01:27:24,838
Come on home.

983
01:27:45,116 --> 01:27:47,903
We did it! I didn't do it, but we did!

984
01:27:47,994 --> 01:27:49,737
Hank is the man of the hour!

985
01:27:56,627 --> 01:27:59,545
Everybody do it.
I'm not going to be the only one.

986
01:28:09,516 --> 01:28:13,894
- Here you go. Well done, sweetie.
- Thank you.

987
01:28:16,231 --> 01:28:21,189
You've got to love that about Daddy.
Even when he loses, he wins.

988
01:28:24,448 --> 01:28:25,776
To vet school.

989
01:28:54,437 --> 01:28:56,346
Eddie, where's your drink?

990
01:29:08,660 --> 01:29:12,658
I don't know my ass from Bakersfield.
Or is it shit from shinola?

991
01:29:13,832 --> 01:29:15,291
Either way.

992
01:29:18,211 --> 01:29:21,960
You take him back with you.
Next year, take him in there yourself.

993
01:29:22,674 --> 01:29:24,299
I'll pay you your rate.

994
01:29:26,094 --> 01:29:28,383
When you're ready, I'll sell you half of him.

995
01:29:31,308 --> 01:29:35,437
I do one decent thing a year,
so I suggest you take me up on it.

996
01:29:37,064 --> 01:29:40,480
Come have a drink at the house.
You've earned at least that.

997
01:29:42,653 --> 01:29:44,527
Let this horse rest.

998
01:30:03,842 --> 01:30:06,795
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

999
01:30:07,511 --> 01:30:10,181
I heard you and Eddie
were getting a divorce.

1000
01:30:11,099 --> 01:30:12,427
How did you hear that?

1001
01:30:13,101 --> 01:30:16,434
Edna told Nadine, who told Kitty,
who told me she saw Eddie...

1002
01:30:16,521 --> 01:30:20,519
...with Jack Pierce,
the meanest divorce guy in town.

1003
01:30:21,234 --> 01:30:23,523
You should hire him if Eddie hasn't.

1004
01:30:23,612 --> 01:30:28,024
When Betsy and Bo Barkley split,
he screwed her to the wall.

1005
01:30:28,408 --> 01:30:30,401
I mean, she got squat.

1006
01:30:33,330 --> 01:30:35,572
Eddie, could I have a word with you?

1007
01:30:36,625 --> 01:30:38,452
- Frank, how are you?
- Hi.

1008
01:30:42,047 --> 01:30:43,707
Mary Jane Reed just told me...

1009
01:30:43,799 --> 01:30:46,800
...you were seen
with Jack '"Mad Dog'" Pierce.

1010
01:30:47,928 --> 01:30:53,136
Couldn't you be more discreet?
I can't stand it being all over the barbecue.

1011
01:30:53,518 --> 01:30:56,886
- It's probably in the newspaper.
- You're right.

1012
01:31:00,024 --> 01:31:01,269
You're right.

1013
01:31:02,985 --> 01:31:04,148
Come on.

1014
01:31:04,571 --> 01:31:07,939
Let's take care of this right now.
Let's get this sorted out.

1015
01:31:08,032 --> 01:31:09,063
Let go!

1016
01:31:15,999 --> 01:31:18,240
I can't believe you're doing this.

1017
01:31:42,818 --> 01:31:44,147
Back it up.

1018
01:31:50,033 --> 01:31:51,232
Walk it.

1019
01:32:51,555 --> 01:32:54,841
- A fitting end.
- I really am sorry, Grace.

1020
01:32:58,645 --> 01:33:00,140
Dance with me.

1021
01:33:00,939 --> 01:33:02,434
Come on, sweetie.

1022
01:33:13,578 --> 01:33:15,736
Come on, let's dance.

1023
01:33:20,835 --> 01:33:23,077
You didn't think you still had it.

1024
01:33:35,100 --> 01:33:37,009
You looked good out there tonight.

1025
01:33:37,435 --> 01:33:38,846
I looked all right.

1026
01:33:39,354 --> 01:33:40,848
I was proud of you.

1027
01:33:42,816 --> 01:33:44,559
I was proud of you, too.

1028
01:33:47,862 --> 01:33:49,606
Daddy, I'm sorry.

1029
01:33:51,199 --> 01:33:52,231
Don't be.

1030
01:33:53,994 --> 01:33:55,109
I'm not.

1031
01:34:12,596 --> 01:34:16,180
Son, you were lucky
to get her the first time.

1032
01:34:20,980 --> 01:34:22,640
It was a damn miracle.

1033
01:35:14,910 --> 01:35:15,942
Come on, Ed.

1034
01:35:16,120 --> 01:35:20,164
If you were a total piece of shit,
I wouldn't give you such a hard time.

1035
01:35:27,465 --> 01:35:30,750
- That's not as easy as it used to be.
- What is?

1036
01:35:32,136 --> 01:35:33,251
God, Grace!

1037
01:35:41,187 --> 01:35:44,058
I'm going to go see a horse about a man.

1038
01:35:53,825 --> 01:35:55,403
I need to talk to you.

1039
01:36:00,790 --> 01:36:02,166
I had fun tonight.

1040
01:36:03,794 --> 01:36:04,790
Me, too.

1041
01:36:10,467 --> 01:36:11,961
If I could go back...

1042
01:36:13,887 --> 01:36:17,506
If we could just get back
to where we were before...

1043
01:36:19,810 --> 01:36:20,924
...I would go.

1044
01:36:21,812 --> 01:36:22,677
Would you?

1045
01:36:27,402 --> 01:36:30,984
How would we make sure we didn't end up
right back here?

1046
01:36:33,324 --> 01:36:34,783
It would be different.

1047
01:36:35,994 --> 01:36:38,401
I'd talk to you before things got...

1048
01:36:41,165 --> 01:36:44,000
I wouldn't do the things
that you can't take back.

1049
01:36:45,253 --> 01:36:47,080
It's not just about that.

1050
01:36:50,675 --> 01:36:52,134
It's my fault, too.

1051
01:36:52,260 --> 01:36:54,003
And I'm sorry.

1052
01:36:54,679 --> 01:36:56,921
I want to be different, too.

1053
01:37:01,644 --> 01:37:03,353
I just don't want to...

1054
01:37:05,524 --> 01:37:08,690
...come to the end of my life
and have to say:

1055
01:37:08,776 --> 01:37:10,650
'"I wanted to be different...

1056
01:37:10,945 --> 01:37:13,437
'"... but I chickened out
when I had the chance. '"

1057
01:37:15,701 --> 01:37:17,361
And I feel like this is it.

1058
01:37:18,787 --> 01:37:20,032
This is...

1059
01:37:20,205 --> 01:37:21,699
...my chance...

1060
01:37:21,790 --> 01:37:24,791
...to become someone that I can be...

1061
01:37:25,503 --> 01:37:26,665
...proud of.

1062
01:37:27,630 --> 01:37:29,207
And I don't want to blow it.

1063
01:37:53,573 --> 01:37:54,818
I think...

1064
01:37:54,991 --> 01:37:57,992
...you and Caroline
should move back home.

1065
01:38:00,204 --> 01:38:02,826
I'll get a place of my own, okay?

1066
01:38:04,459 --> 01:38:06,452
I think it'd be better for her.

1067
01:38:08,338 --> 01:38:09,536
For all of us.

1068
01:38:18,515 --> 01:38:20,507
I love you, Grace.

1069
01:38:22,227 --> 01:38:23,721
I love you, too.

1070
01:38:49,546 --> 01:38:51,171
You can use the door.

1071
01:39:19,869 --> 01:39:21,577
- See you.
- Take care.

1072
01:39:26,877 --> 01:39:28,502
Bet you're glad to be rolling.

1073
01:39:29,088 --> 01:39:31,708
Well, it's been interesting.

1074
01:39:33,300 --> 01:39:35,043
I'll see you next year.

1075
01:39:35,886 --> 01:39:37,215
I'll be here.

1076
01:39:54,947 --> 01:39:57,403
SCHOOL OF VETERINARY MEDICINE

1077
01:40:04,165 --> 01:40:07,332
I'm meeting Melissa for supper,
you and Caroline want to come?

1078
01:40:07,419 --> 01:40:09,411
Sorry, I can't. I have a date.

1079
01:40:09,588 --> 01:40:11,580
A date? Or a '"date'" date?

1080
01:40:11,964 --> 01:40:13,340
A first date.

1081
01:40:13,758 --> 01:40:15,466
- Later.
- See you tomorrow.

1082
01:40:57,386 --> 01:40:59,344
- Hi.
- Hi.

1083
01:41:02,182 --> 01:41:03,178
How was school?

1084
01:41:03,851 --> 01:41:06,010
It was great. You're early.

1085
01:41:07,188 --> 01:41:09,395
You finally said yes to dinner.

1086
01:41:09,524 --> 01:41:11,765
I figured it better be good.

1087
01:41:21,953 --> 01:41:23,151
Poached pears?

1088
01:41:23,246 --> 01:41:24,906
Yeah, with Chantilly cream.

1089
01:41:35,300 --> 01:41:36,463
You first.
