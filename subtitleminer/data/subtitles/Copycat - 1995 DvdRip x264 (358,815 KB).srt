00:00:54,626 --> 00:00:57,459
<i>The screams of the victim
deaden his pain.</i>

2
00:00:58,066 --> 00:01:01,263
<i>The act of killing
makes him feel intensely alive.</i>

3
00:01:01,546 --> 00:01:03,980
<i>What he feels next is not guilt...</i>

4
00:01:04,146 --> 00:01:05,784
<i>but disappointment.</i>

5
00:01:05,986 --> 00:01:08,216
<i>It was not as wonderful
as he'd hoped.</i>

6
00:01:08,346 --> 00:01:10,860
Maybe next time, it will be perfect.

7
00:01:11,666 --> 00:01:14,658
And as his determination builds
to take another life...

8
00:01:14,746 --> 00:01:17,135
he plans, in obsessive detail...

9
00:01:17,306 --> 00:01:19,024
what props he'll bring...

10
00:01:19,106 --> 00:01:21,062
what knots he'll tie.

11
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:24,657
Let me ask you something.

12
00:01:24,786 --> 00:01:26,139
What turns you on ?

13
00:01:26,386 --> 00:01:29,264
What really does it for you ?
Is it a great body ?

14
00:01:29,346 --> 00:01:32,179
Is it a nice smile ?
Is it beautiful legs ?

15
00:01:32,626 --> 00:01:37,142
What turns on a serial killer is the
suffering and death of a human being.

16
00:01:37,826 --> 00:01:40,420
Now, I'd like to ask you
guys a favor.

17
00:01:40,546 --> 00:01:43,504
If you could all stand up,
all the men in the room.

18
00:01:43,586 --> 00:01:45,258
Please indulge me.

19
00:01:48,426 --> 00:01:52,180
Come on, it's only fair,
after all the time you've ogled us.

20
00:01:52,386 --> 00:01:55,822
Now, would everybody under 20
and over 35 have a seat.

21
00:01:56,186 --> 00:02:00,225
If you are of Asian or African-American
descent, you may sit down.

22
00:02:00,386 --> 00:02:02,900
Kenny, turn that light on, please...

23
00:02:03,266 --> 00:02:05,985
so we can get a good look
at these guys.

24
00:02:06,466 --> 00:02:08,263
Ladies, what do you see ?

25
00:02:09,026 --> 00:02:11,221
Some pretty cute guys,
don't you think ?

26
00:02:11,306 --> 00:02:14,776
If one of these fellas asked you out
for a drink, you'd go.

27
00:02:15,346 --> 00:02:17,018
Let me tell you something.

28
00:02:17,146 --> 00:02:20,297
Nine out of ten serial killers
are white males...

29
00:02:21,026 --> 00:02:22,618
aged 20 to 35...

30
00:02:22,706 --> 00:02:24,424
just like these.

31
00:02:25,546 --> 00:02:28,060
Albert DeSalvo, Bianchi and Buono...

32
00:02:28,466 --> 00:02:30,775
Berkowitz, Dahmer, Ted Bundy.

33
00:02:30,906 --> 00:02:32,897
They were quiet, unassuming...

34
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:34,419
even nice.

35
00:02:34,506 --> 00:02:37,020
They had jobs.
They made decent neighbors.

36
00:02:37,106 --> 00:02:39,142
Their victims trusted them.

37
00:02:39,306 --> 00:02:40,580
The FBI estimates...

38
00:02:40,666 --> 00:02:43,783
there could be as many as
35 serial killers...

39
00:02:43,946 --> 00:02:46,699
cruising for victims
even as I speak.

40
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:49,341
Guys, sit down.
You're scaring me.

41
00:02:51,146 --> 00:02:52,295
Serial killers...

42
00:02:52,386 --> 00:02:54,536
are not a 20th-century
invention...

43
00:02:54,626 --> 00:02:57,220
but we are spawning them
in greater numbers.

44
00:02:58,026 --> 00:03:00,938
The state of Florida
spent almost $8 million...

45
00:03:01,026 --> 00:03:02,664
to electrocute Ted...

46
00:03:04,066 --> 00:03:05,465
You're dead.

47
00:03:12,426 --> 00:03:13,461
Sorry.

48
00:03:14,786 --> 00:03:18,665
The state of Florida spent $8 million
to electrocute Ted Bundy.

49
00:03:19,266 --> 00:03:22,815
Wouldn't that money have been
better spent keeping him in jail...

50
00:03:22,986 --> 00:03:25,454
subject to intense
scientific scrutiny ?

51
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:29,984
Isn't our best hope to try to identify
the Ted Bundys of the future...

52
00:03:30,706 --> 00:03:32,424
before they kill ?

53
00:03:33,706 --> 00:03:34,821
Thank you.

54
00:03:40,546 --> 00:03:42,298
Don't park next to vans.

55
00:03:42,386 --> 00:03:43,501
Thanks for coming.

56
00:03:43,586 --> 00:03:45,417
I'm hitting the ladies' room.

57
00:03:45,506 --> 00:03:48,304
Since she's using the ladies' room,
I'll use the men's room.

58
00:03:48,386 --> 00:03:50,900
- Thanks for your help, Tom.
- Anytime.

59
00:03:56,186 --> 00:03:57,335
Hello ?

60
00:04:06,946 --> 00:04:08,174
Sorry, ma'am.

61
00:04:09,226 --> 00:04:10,978
Doc, it's all yours.

62
00:05:14,026 --> 00:05:15,379
Dr. Hudson ?

63
00:05:18,546 --> 00:05:19,695
Hello ?

64
00:05:30,146 --> 00:05:31,977
Come out with your hands up.

65
00:05:34,586 --> 00:05:36,622
I'm not going to ask you...

66
00:05:44,386 --> 00:05:46,661
What are you doing with my gun ?

67
00:05:47,546 --> 00:05:49,218
How'd you get my gun ?

68
00:05:49,346 --> 00:05:53,498
What are you doing in the ladies' room ?
Are you spying on little girls ?

69
00:05:56,226 --> 00:05:58,296
I'll tell you something right now.

70
00:05:59,106 --> 00:06:01,097
Don't she look pretty up there,
Officer ?

71
00:06:01,186 --> 00:06:03,302
You know what I want to know ?

72
00:06:03,466 --> 00:06:05,980
Help me out on this,
since you're the expert.

73
00:06:06,146 --> 00:06:08,102
How would a fartknocker like me...

74
00:06:08,186 --> 00:06:10,575
take out a dumb guy like this ?

75
00:06:10,946 --> 00:06:12,504
Would you stick him...

76
00:06:12,866 --> 00:06:13,901
or would you shoot him ?

77
00:06:13,986 --> 00:06:15,897
Stick him or shoot him ?

78
00:06:17,306 --> 00:06:20,696
I can't decide, but I think
I'll just go ahead and do both.

79
00:06:32,106 --> 00:06:34,495
You bloodied up my knife,
you dog.

80
00:06:34,986 --> 00:06:36,385
I hate cops.

81
00:06:38,466 --> 00:06:39,785
Hey, Dr. Hudson.

82
00:06:42,186 --> 00:06:45,019
What do you say me and you
have a little fun ?

83
00:07:12,506 --> 00:07:13,700
John Adams...

84
00:07:14,786 --> 00:07:15,980
Adams...

85
00:07:16,106 --> 00:07:17,585
Jefferson...

86
00:07:19,026 --> 00:07:21,176
James Monroe, James Madison...

87
00:07:22,706 --> 00:07:24,458
John Quincy Adams.

88
00:07:24,946 --> 00:07:26,061
Andy ?

89
00:07:27,586 --> 00:07:28,701
Andy ?

90
00:07:34,826 --> 00:07:36,498
John Quincy Adams.

91
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:39,179
Andrew Jackson.

92
00:07:40,906 --> 00:07:42,419
Martin Van Buren.

93
00:07:42,546 --> 00:07:44,696
Wait a minute.
This is so stupid.

94
00:07:45,906 --> 00:07:47,259
Calvin Coolidge.

95
00:09:05,066 --> 00:09:06,385
I got you beat.

96
00:09:15,746 --> 00:09:17,065
Bye, Kate.

97
00:10:37,186 --> 00:10:38,699
Police ! Freeze !

98
00:10:46,386 --> 00:10:48,980
The good news is,
you're still alive.

99
00:10:50,306 --> 00:10:52,058
You see a downside to that ?

100
00:10:52,146 --> 00:10:54,137
This is pretty remedial stuff.

101
00:10:54,306 --> 00:10:56,342
Let's review the scenario.

102
00:10:56,506 --> 00:10:59,896
Didn't anyone at the Academy
teach you to shoot conservatively?

103
00:11:01,186 --> 00:11:02,301
You shredded him.

104
00:11:02,386 --> 00:11:03,899
I'm an intuitive cop.

105
00:11:03,986 --> 00:11:05,817
With poor impulse control.

106
00:11:06,146 --> 00:11:08,785
Let's assume you didn't mow down
a 75-year-old man...

107
00:11:08,866 --> 00:11:11,778
who couldn't hear your warning
because he's deaf.

108
00:11:11,906 --> 00:11:15,819
Let's say you greased the guy
while he was trying to surrender.

109
00:11:17,506 --> 00:11:19,940
Now, you're on leave
pending an inquiry.

110
00:11:20,066 --> 00:11:22,580
Friends wonder if you're a psychopath.
On top of that...

111
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:27,103
the guy's junkie-wife's lawyer slams
a wrongful-death action up your tail.

112
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:29,700
All right, smart-ass,
let's see how you do.

113
00:11:35,746 --> 00:11:37,623
The shoulder of
his gun hand's exposed.

114
00:11:37,706 --> 00:11:41,415
You hit the brachial nerve,
he drops the gun. You read him his rights.

115
00:11:41,506 --> 00:11:45,465
Plus, you haven't taken a human life
so your karma's still okay.

116
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:47,338
You hungry ? I'm starving.

117
00:11:47,426 --> 00:11:50,498
- Aren't you going to answer that ?
- No, it's probably not important.

118
00:11:50,586 --> 00:11:51,905
She thinks it is.

119
00:11:52,026 --> 00:11:54,221
How about Moroccan ?
You like couscous ?

120
00:11:54,306 --> 00:11:56,615
Don't you want to know
which one it is ?

121
00:11:58,946 --> 00:11:59,901
Hello ?

122
00:12:00,226 --> 00:12:03,901
You must have mental telepathy.
I was just about to call you.

123
00:12:04,386 --> 00:12:07,583
The usual.
Long days making sure justice prevails.

124
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:19,179
10390 Mariposa.

125
00:13:20,026 --> 00:13:22,540
Scaffolding on the north and west sides
of the building.

126
00:13:22,626 --> 00:13:24,662
Great.
The Mouth is here.

127
00:13:25,066 --> 00:13:26,579
You can end her career.

128
00:13:26,666 --> 00:13:29,897
Pop her in the brachial nerve,
she'll drop the microphone.

129
00:13:31,186 --> 00:13:32,619
It's a thought.

130
00:13:45,626 --> 00:13:47,503
- How are you ?
- Fine, thanks.

131
00:13:47,586 --> 00:13:51,977
Can you confirm that this latest murder
fits the same pattern as the other two ?

132
00:13:52,066 --> 00:13:54,261
We just got here.
I'm not prepared to...

133
00:13:54,346 --> 00:13:57,895
Is there a serial killer stalking
the streets of San Francisco ?

134
00:13:57,986 --> 00:14:00,216
Excuse me.
I'm a member of the press.

135
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:01,625
Hey, MJ, all done.

136
00:14:01,706 --> 00:14:05,858
Hey, Jim. Can you grab some overalls
from the crowd, some nice, clear faces ?

137
00:14:05,986 --> 00:14:07,897
I'll make them say "cheese".

138
00:14:08,306 --> 00:14:09,898
The landlady found her.

139
00:14:10,066 --> 00:14:11,863
The front door was open.
She tried the bell.

140
00:14:11,946 --> 00:14:15,097
The tenant didn't answer,
so she went inside and found the body.

141
00:14:15,186 --> 00:14:18,781
She used the telephone to dial 911,
otherwise she touched nothing.

142
00:14:18,906 --> 00:14:21,181
- You're thinking robbery ?
- It doesn't look like it.

143
00:14:21,266 --> 00:14:24,019
It's all yours, kids.
I'll take care of the Mouth.

144
00:14:24,106 --> 00:14:25,425
Good morning, sir.

145
00:14:25,506 --> 00:14:28,578
- With this scaffolding, we should call...
- I'll call the contractor.

146
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:29,985
Take this.

147
00:14:32,266 --> 00:14:33,585
Good morning.

148
00:14:35,746 --> 00:14:37,543
Were you first on the scene ?

149
00:14:38,466 --> 00:14:39,979
Is that the landlady ?

150
00:14:40,906 --> 00:14:42,100
Thanks.

151
00:14:42,706 --> 00:14:44,776
- "Johnson". What's the first part ?
- Mike.

152
00:14:44,866 --> 00:14:46,618
Did you touch anything, Mike?

153
00:14:46,706 --> 00:14:49,823
I don't want to get excited about
latents and find out they're yours.

154
00:14:49,906 --> 00:14:51,942
- No, I didn't.
- You didn't ?

155
00:14:54,266 --> 00:14:58,054
<i>She usually goes jogging in the morning,
to the Delores Park.</i>

156
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:35,060
This one.

157
00:16:03,866 --> 00:16:05,265
Pretty wild.

158
00:16:06,186 --> 00:16:07,505
How're you doing ?

159
00:16:08,146 --> 00:16:09,818
Got an estimate for me ?

160
00:16:10,186 --> 00:16:11,858
About eight hours.

161
00:16:12,866 --> 00:16:15,460
I'm seeing ligature marks, petechiae.

162
00:16:15,626 --> 00:16:17,059
Strangled, huh ?

163
00:16:17,306 --> 00:16:19,024
Same as the others.

164
00:16:19,666 --> 00:16:21,736
You'll bag all the stuff
on the bedside table ?

165
00:16:21,826 --> 00:16:25,182
Thanks, Bill. Excellent.
That's the only one I need.

166
00:16:34,266 --> 00:16:35,984
Were you the first one here ?

167
00:16:36,066 --> 00:16:37,419
Did you touch anything ?

168
00:16:37,506 --> 00:16:38,780
No, ma'am.

169
00:16:40,626 --> 00:16:41,979
What's wrong ?

170
00:16:42,146 --> 00:16:43,340
Nothing.

171
00:16:43,826 --> 00:16:47,739
If you're holding out on me,
I'll get it out of you. You know I will.

172
00:16:49,586 --> 00:16:52,862
There was a stocking around
her neck when I found her.

173
00:16:52,986 --> 00:16:55,102
I don't know
what happened to it.

174
00:16:56,426 --> 00:16:59,179
Who else was in there before
the CSI came ?

175
00:17:00,866 --> 00:17:02,299
Lieutenant Quinn.

176
00:17:03,506 --> 00:17:05,098
That's all right, then.

177
00:17:05,266 --> 00:17:06,460
Thanks, Mike.

178

I want to hear this.

188
00:17:39,506 --> 00:17:40,939
You messed with the scene.

189
00:17:41,026 --> 00:17:44,701
Someone around here can't keep
his yap shut, and I'll find out who.

190
00:17:44,786 --> 00:17:46,378
What did you do with the stocking ?

191
00:17:46,466 --> 00:17:47,785
I tagged it.

192
00:17:47,866 --> 00:17:51,176
I don't want some blabbermouth
leaking the MO to her...

193
00:17:51,266 --> 00:17:54,781
so she can tell everyone,
leaving us nothing to play.

194

Am I in charge of this or not ?

195
00:17:59,586 --> 00:18:00,905
Why are you so prickly ?

196
00:18:00,986 --> 00:18:04,615
I ought to be the one deciding
what evidence to sequester.

197
00:18:04,826 --> 00:18:06,623
All right, lnspector.

198
00:18:07,266 --> 00:18:10,576
Which evidence on this case
would you like to sequester ?

199
00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:14,022
- The stocking around the neck.
- The stocking around the neck.

200
00:18:14,386 --> 00:18:16,456
You're one pushy broad, MJ.

201
00:18:16,706 --> 00:18:18,856
I'll take that
as a compliment, sir.

202
00:18:22,946 --> 00:18:26,063
I didn't say serial killer,
you didn't say serial killer.

203
00:18:38,266 --> 00:18:39,745
For Christ's sake.

Thomas Jefferson.

James Madison.

209
00:19:20,346 --> 00:19:21,779
James Monroe.

210
00:19:25,626 --> 00:19:27,025
Oh, come on.

211
00:19:28,586 --> 00:19:30,258
John Quincy Adams.

00:19:53,986 --> 00:19:55,180
Idiots !

214
00:19:59,026 --> 00:20:01,699
You followed the girl home.
Then what ?

215
00:20:02,706 --> 00:20:03,934
I killed her.

216
00:20:05,866 --> 00:20:07,424
Where did you do that ?

217
00:20:08,546 --> 00:20:10,138
It was in the bathtub.

218
00:20:12,706 --> 00:20:14,219
Why did you do that ?

219
00:20:16,026 --> 00:20:17,505
She was dirty.

220
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:20,260
She was a very dirty girl.
Very dirty.

221
00:20:23,106 --> 00:20:24,585
Do you remember...

222
00:20:24,786 --> 00:20:27,220
how many times you stabbed her ?

223
00:20:29,386 --> 00:20:30,819
Eighty-seven.

224
00:20:33,346 --> 00:20:34,461
Harvey...

225
00:20:37,266 --> 00:20:39,097
Get the fuck out of here.

226
00:20:39,186 --> 00:20:40,824
I got work to do.

227
00:20:42,226 --> 00:20:44,217
Come on, let's go.
What ?

228
00:20:44,546 --> 00:20:46,457
Innocent blood is on these hands.

229
00:20:46,546 --> 00:20:49,856
I understand. That's a terrible thing.
But let me tell you...

230
00:20:49,946 --> 00:20:53,734
if you come back, I'll make you
stand in the corner again.

231
00:20:54,306 --> 00:20:58,538
- But innocent blood is on these hands.
- I understand. It's terrible.

232
00:21:00,466 --> 00:21:02,696
You don't care about the truth.

233
00:21:02,986 --> 00:21:07,184
We pay for city government, just like this,
and you never care about the truth.

234
00:21:07,306 --> 00:21:08,375
I killed her !

235
00:21:08,466 --> 00:21:10,696
- I know.
- I killed her in the bathtub.

236
00:21:10,786 --> 00:21:12,299
Good-bye, Harvey.

237
00:21:15,066 --> 00:21:17,534
Was it something
I did in another life ?

238
00:21:17,666 --> 00:21:19,975
Probably something
you did in this one.

239
00:21:21,746 --> 00:21:24,783
Stuff came in from Mercer.
Medical, dental receipts....

240
00:21:25,026 --> 00:21:27,142
Nothing in common with the others.

241
00:21:27,426 --> 00:21:29,303
What's that around your neck ?

242
00:21:30,786 --> 00:21:34,142
I'd get one like yours,
but I don't live near K Mart.

243
00:21:34,906 --> 00:21:36,942
How about friends, acquaintances ?

244
00:21:37,826 --> 00:21:40,943
The only thing these girls had in common
is they all owned vibrators.

245
00:21:41,026 --> 00:21:42,618
The tool of survival.

246
00:21:42,786 --> 00:21:45,346
How can he come
to work wearing that ?

247
00:21:45,506 --> 00:21:46,780
Lay off him.

248
00:21:47,146 --> 00:21:48,704
A cop should look like a cop.

249
00:21:48,786 --> 00:21:50,856
What's the world coming to ?

250
00:21:51,826 --> 00:21:54,579
Let me let you talk to
the lead inspector on the case.

251
00:21:54,666 --> 00:21:55,894
Hold on.

252
00:21:57,066 --> 00:21:59,261
MJ, we got Deep Throat again.

253
00:21:59,826 --> 00:22:01,259
How many calls is that ?

254
00:22:01,346 --> 00:22:04,144
That makes three today.
Fourteen, total.

255
00:22:04,546 --> 00:22:06,696
Phone company
set up on our Centrex ?

256
00:22:06,786 --> 00:22:08,139
Yes, this morning.

257
00:22:08,266 --> 00:22:11,576
- Have Gigi put a tracer on her ass.
- I'll see if it'll work.

258
00:22:12,586 --> 00:22:15,225
Inspector Monahan speaking.
Homicide.

259
00:22:16,066 --> 00:22:18,216
Ask her about the moon bike.

260
00:22:19,026 --> 00:22:21,221
I'm interested in your ideas.

261
00:22:21,426 --> 00:22:23,064
The moon bike....

262
00:22:25,546 --> 00:22:26,535
What is that ?

263
00:22:26,626 --> 00:22:27,661
<i>Moon bike ?</i>

264
00:22:28,026 --> 00:22:31,018
I said a "lunar cycle."
I think he might be on a lunar cycle.

265
00:22:31,106 --> 00:22:34,143
<i>Because the first two murders
were 28 days apart.</i>

266
00:22:34,306 --> 00:22:35,659
Still want to crackjokes ?

267
00:22:35,746 --> 00:22:39,819
No, this is no joke. Neither is tying up
police lines with crank calls.

268
00:22:39,906 --> 00:22:41,658
Are you calling me a crank ?

269
00:22:41,826 --> 00:22:44,863
Do you have any evidence to report ?
Did you know the victims ?

270
00:22:44,946 --> 00:22:46,425
This is Number 3.

271
00:22:46,506 --> 00:22:48,303
That is an opinion, not evidence.

272
00:22:48,386 --> 00:22:50,616
May I ask who I'm speaking with ?

273
00:22:59,826 --> 00:23:01,225
Who's Helen Hudson ?

274
00:23:01,426 --> 00:23:05,704
<i>What did you think of his claim,
that he tied these women to a tree...</i>

275
00:23:05,826 --> 00:23:08,863
<i>and burned them alive because
Joan of Arc told him to ?</i>

276
00:23:08,946 --> 00:23:10,174
<i>He was lying.</i>

277
00:23:10,306 --> 00:23:11,739
<i>How do you know ?</i>

278
00:23:11,826 --> 00:23:15,944
<i>People suffering from aural hallucinations
hear voices in both ears.</i>

279
00:23:16,146 --> 00:23:17,215
<i>In stereo.</i>

280
00:23:17,506 --> 00:23:19,098
<i>Daryll Lee told me...</i>

281
00:23:19,746 --> 00:23:21,577
<i>Joan of Arc always appeared
on his left side...</i>

282
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:24,055
<i>and spoke softly in his left ear.</i>

283
00:23:24,226 --> 00:23:27,423
Those are the lab results,
hot off the press. No sperm.

284
00:23:28,626 --> 00:23:30,139
We've got a serial.

285
00:23:30,466 --> 00:23:31,979
You didn't say that.

286
00:23:32,586 --> 00:23:34,224
<i>You interviewed Cullum three times.</i>

287
00:23:34,306 --> 00:23:37,184
Who's that ?
The woman that got the cop killed ?

288
00:23:37,266 --> 00:23:38,619
She might be useful.

289
00:23:38,706 --> 00:23:42,176
That woman is a wrong number.
Work the clues, for Christ's sake.

290
00:23:44,146 --> 00:23:45,818
What clues ?
We don't have any clues.

291
00:23:45,906 --> 00:23:48,659
Nobody here has ever worked
a serial case before.

292
00:23:49,546 --> 00:23:50,501
I have.

293
00:23:50,586 --> 00:23:51,939
The Zodiac, right ?

294
00:23:52,066 --> 00:23:55,741
Did anyone ever catch the Zodiac,
or did he die of old age ?

295
00:23:57,106 --> 00:23:59,745
Commissioner's on 2,
about the Chinatown thing.

296
00:24:00,066 --> 00:24:01,579
Work the clues.

297
00:24:05,346 --> 00:24:06,779
<i>But what else ?</i>

298
00:24:07,786 --> 00:24:10,220
<i>Mr. Cullum satisfies
the rules for sanity...</i>

299
00:24:10,306 --> 00:24:12,422
<i>in being fully aware
at the time of the murders...</i>

300
00:24:12,506 --> 00:24:14,861
<i>that his actions were wrong
and unlawful.</i>

301
00:24:14,946 --> 00:24:17,380
<i>Thank you, Dr. Hudson.
No more questions.</i>

302
00:24:28,586 --> 00:24:29,701
San Francisco Homicide.

303
00:24:29,786 --> 00:24:32,459
I'm Inspector Goetz.
This is Inspector Monahan.

304
00:24:32,946 --> 00:24:34,379
Is Helen Hudson here ?

305
00:24:34,466 --> 00:24:36,457
I'm her assistant.
Can I help ?

306
00:24:36,546 --> 00:24:38,696
Could we have a few minutes ?

307
00:24:39,906 --> 00:24:40,895
Come in.

308
00:24:45,586 --> 00:24:47,144
This way, please.

309
00:24:49,346 --> 00:24:52,622
Dr. Hudson, these are
Inspectors Goetz and Monahan.

310
00:24:53,666 --> 00:24:55,338
He's escaped again, right ?

311
00:24:55,426 --> 00:24:56,415
I'm sorry ?

312
00:24:56,506 --> 00:24:57,256
Well ?

313
00:24:57,346 --> 00:24:59,177
Is he out or isn't he ?

314
00:24:59,426 --> 00:25:01,303
I'm not following, ma'am.

315
00:25:01,386 --> 00:25:03,661
Let's talk about your phone calls.

316
00:25:03,826 --> 00:25:05,225
Phone calls ?

317
00:25:05,506 --> 00:25:07,656
I didn't make any phone calls.

318
00:25:09,186 --> 00:25:10,778
Isn't this nice ?

319
00:25:11,026 --> 00:25:14,143
Would everyone like to sit down ?
Shall I make coffee ?

320
00:25:14,666 --> 00:25:15,860
Get me my stuff.

321
00:25:15,946 --> 00:25:17,174
Joyfully.

322
00:25:18,106 --> 00:25:20,904
I talked to you this morning,
Dr. Hudson.

323
00:25:22,266 --> 00:25:23,335
Do you remember ?

324
00:25:23,426 --> 00:25:25,223
Of course I remember.

325
00:25:25,426 --> 00:25:28,702
There's nothing wrong with my memory.
You called me a crank.

326
00:25:29,986 --> 00:25:31,499
I suppose I am.

327
00:25:31,866 --> 00:25:34,141
I got a couple crank calls myself.

328
00:25:34,306 --> 00:25:37,457
That's why I thought
Daryll Lee Cullum was out of prison.

329
00:25:37,906 --> 00:25:41,376
If Daryll Lee had gotten out,
you'd be the first to know.

330
00:25:42,226 --> 00:25:43,181
Good.

331
00:25:43,306 --> 00:25:44,455
I'm relieved.

332
00:25:44,546 --> 00:25:47,822
I hate to sound like a broken record,
but you called us.

333
00:25:49,986 --> 00:25:52,295
I did. I'm sorry,
it won't happen again.

334
00:25:52,386 --> 00:25:53,375
Why ?

335
00:25:53,466 --> 00:25:57,698
There's a serial killer out there who's
strangled three women. He'll do it again.

336
00:25:57,786 --> 00:26:01,745
If there's evidence connecting these
murders, nothing's been made public.

337
00:26:02,426 --> 00:26:03,381
How do you connect them ?

338
00:26:03,466 --> 00:26:04,615
I don't know.

339
00:26:04,706 --> 00:26:08,142
Twenty years of clinical
experience with serial killers.

340
00:26:09,826 --> 00:26:11,782
Would you work with us on this ?

341
00:26:13,826 --> 00:26:15,145
You're kidding ?

342
00:26:18,826 --> 00:26:21,818
I thought you knew
that I don't do this anymore.

343
00:26:21,986 --> 00:26:23,135
I'm retired.

344
00:26:23,346 --> 00:26:26,622
Is that why you called us 14 times ?
'Cause you're retired ?

345
00:26:26,786 --> 00:26:29,175
Help me out.
I really admire your work.

346
00:26:29,266 --> 00:26:30,824
Does she do this...

347
00:26:31,426 --> 00:26:33,576
wide-eyed-little-girl
routine often ?

348
00:26:33,666 --> 00:26:34,621
Yeah.

349
00:26:35,746 --> 00:26:36,940
Does it work ?

350
00:26:37,186 --> 00:26:38,938
- Usually.
- Sometimes.

351
00:26:39,586 --> 00:26:41,656
You can spare me the bullshit.

352
00:26:41,826 --> 00:26:45,216
You don't admire me or like me.
None of your people do.

353
00:26:45,346 --> 00:26:49,259
But I don't give a fuck !
That's the upside of a nervous breakdown.

354
00:26:50,306 --> 00:26:52,774
If you don't mind,
I have a very busy day.

355
00:26:53,986 --> 00:26:56,784
It's a hell of an apartment
you got here.

356
00:26:56,946 --> 00:26:58,265
I guess...

357
00:26:58,386 --> 00:27:01,264
the books you wrote
about these scumbags paid well.

358
00:27:01,346 --> 00:27:03,541
We can't afford to pay you...

359
00:27:04,146 --> 00:27:05,579
your usual fee...

360
00:27:05,666 --> 00:27:08,464
but if you'd be so kind
as to look....

361
00:27:09,986 --> 00:27:11,339
I don't want these here.

362
00:27:11,426 --> 00:27:14,304
- Would you be comfortable downtown ?
- I don't want to see them here.

363
00:27:14,386 --> 00:27:16,297
I'll drive you, if you prefer.

364
00:27:24,786 --> 00:27:28,096
It's all right. It's okay.
Just breathe. I'm here.

365
00:27:29,826 --> 00:27:31,657
- Should we call the paramedics ?
- No.

366
00:27:31,746 --> 00:27:33,976
It's just a good,
old-fashioned panic attack.

367
00:27:34,066 --> 00:27:37,945
She hyperventilates till she faints, then her
breathing gets normal and she's fine.

368
00:27:38,026 --> 00:27:39,982
- What did we do ?
- She's agoraphobic.

369
00:27:40,066 --> 00:27:42,216
She's afraid of spiders, too ?

370
00:27:42,706 --> 00:27:44,458
She hasn't left home
in over a year.

371
00:27:44,546 --> 00:27:45,820
She's okay ?

372
00:27:45,906 --> 00:27:48,579
She's fine. In half an hour,
she'll be singing.

373
00:27:48,786 --> 00:27:49,980
Tell her...

374
00:27:50,506 --> 00:27:52,542
we're sorry we bothered her.

375
00:27:53,266 --> 00:27:55,222
Did you want her
to look at those ?

376
00:27:55,306 --> 00:27:56,864
If you do, leave them.

377
00:27:57,506 --> 00:27:59,178
I'll make sure they're safe.

378
00:27:59,266 --> 00:28:00,938
Tell her to call me...

379
00:28:01,066 --> 00:28:02,704
if she feels like it.

380
00:28:10,306 --> 00:28:12,501
That one is a strange ranger.

381
00:28:13,826 --> 00:28:15,657
Quinn said she was a crackpot.

382
00:28:15,746 --> 00:28:18,738
He forgot to mention pill-popping
juicehead...

383
00:28:19,746 --> 00:28:22,465
hyperventilating,
agoraphobic asshole.

384
00:28:23,906 --> 00:28:25,658
I thought she was sweet.

385
00:28:28,066 --> 00:28:29,545
Honest to God !

386
00:28:50,946 --> 00:28:52,220
Are they gone ?

387
00:28:52,946 --> 00:28:53,935
All gone.

388
00:28:55,906 --> 00:28:58,466
I must've looked like
such an asshole.

389
00:29:00,706 --> 00:29:02,424
You look good with a bag
on your head.

390
00:29:02,506 --> 00:29:03,734
Oh, God.

391
00:29:04,066 --> 00:29:05,260
I want to die.

392
00:29:05,346 --> 00:29:06,461
I wouldn't.

393
00:29:06,586 --> 00:29:07,985
He'll be back.

394
00:29:08,066 --> 00:29:09,419
Who'll be back ?

395
00:29:09,906 --> 00:29:11,339
Don't be coy.

396
00:29:12,506 --> 00:29:13,985
You thought he was cute, too.

397
00:29:14,066 --> 00:29:16,057
No, I didn't.
I did not.

398
00:29:16,626 --> 00:29:20,904
You like those cute, brutal types
with the eyebrows and the handcuffs.

399
00:29:22,946 --> 00:29:24,095
Admit it.

400
00:29:25,666 --> 00:29:26,416
Oh, God.

401
00:29:26,506 --> 00:29:28,258
What ? What'd I say ?

402
00:29:28,906 --> 00:29:30,055
Nothing.

403
00:29:30,786 --> 00:29:32,139
I miss men.

404
00:29:32,946 --> 00:29:34,265
What am I ?

405
00:29:34,386 --> 00:29:35,899
You know what I mean.

406
00:29:36,866 --> 00:29:38,219
I miss sex.

407
00:29:42,466 --> 00:29:43,819
He was pretty cute.

408
00:29:43,906 --> 00:29:45,737
Yes, he was very cute.

409
00:29:49,186 --> 00:29:51,017
No young cops for you.

410
00:29:53,026 --> 00:29:56,143
Up you come. Sit over here.
Look at these pictures.

411
00:29:56,226 --> 00:29:57,579
Why are these here ?

412
00:29:57,666 --> 00:29:59,338
I'll get you some coffee.

413
00:30:00,306 --> 00:30:01,261
I can't.

414
00:30:01,346 --> 00:30:03,416
Why don't you just die, then ?

415
00:30:03,746 --> 00:30:08,058
They'll find you years from now amongst
unopened mail and unread newspapers.

416
00:30:09,186 --> 00:30:13,065
Yeah, the old hermit lady.
She lived on cat food and Camembert.

417
00:30:13,266 --> 00:30:15,734
She used to be
a really good shrink.

418
00:30:15,906 --> 00:30:18,545
Make up your mind.
Here's your coffee.

419
00:30:18,786 --> 00:30:20,185
Live or die.

420
00:34:55,666 --> 00:34:57,099
You scared me.

421
00:34:57,186 --> 00:34:58,858
Burning the midnight oil ?

422
00:35:01,346 --> 00:35:03,382
This stuff never gets any easier.

423
00:35:03,466 --> 00:35:06,139
That's why they pay us
the small bucks.

424
00:35:12,426 --> 00:35:13,700
Do you...

425
00:35:18,826 --> 00:35:20,578
What would you think if...

426
00:35:20,746 --> 00:35:23,544
when you're finished here
we go to Joe's and we...

427
00:35:23,626 --> 00:35:25,537
have a steak and...

428
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:30,139
I don't think so.

429
00:35:31,426 --> 00:35:32,859
Thanks anyway.

430
00:35:33,986 --> 00:35:37,581
You got other plans ?
Not that it's any of my business...

431
00:35:38,626 --> 00:35:40,139
You got that right.

432
00:35:41,506 --> 00:35:43,337
Bean curd, smoked-eel sushi.

433
00:35:44,226 --> 00:35:47,263
We got prawn tempura, seaweed salad.
You want to join us ?

434
00:35:47,346 --> 00:35:49,701
You kiss your mother
after eating that ?

435
00:35:49,986 --> 00:35:51,863
No. I can kiss you,
if you like.

436
00:35:51,946 --> 00:35:53,265
Go fuck yourself.

437
00:36:00,946 --> 00:36:02,220
Who put the bug up his ass ?

438
00:36:02,306 --> 00:36:03,898
Where's my cheeseburger ?

439
00:36:04,186 --> 00:36:06,017
I made an executive decision.

440
00:36:06,626 --> 00:36:07,900
Japanese.

441
00:36:09,026 --> 00:36:10,778
It's better for your heart.

442
00:36:13,666 --> 00:36:16,305
You didn't even get French fries.
You're pissing me off.

443
00:36:16,386 --> 00:36:17,660
Here, here.

444
00:36:18,466 --> 00:36:19,899
Any word from...

445
00:36:20,226 --> 00:36:22,376
Helen "Paper Bag" Hudson ?

446
00:36:22,866 --> 00:36:24,857
Not yet, but there will be.

447
00:36:25,026 --> 00:36:25,617
No way.

448
00:36:25,706 --> 00:36:28,015
Five bucks
she's going to call tonight.

449
00:36:29,226 --> 00:36:30,215
Deal.

450
00:36:33,186 --> 00:36:34,460
Wait a minute.

451
00:36:35,426 --> 00:36:38,304
What's this Quarter Pounder
with cheese doing here ?

452
00:36:52,146 --> 00:36:54,137
Inspector Monahan, please.

453
00:36:54,466 --> 00:36:56,900
These three are the work
of the same man.

454
00:36:57,666 --> 00:36:59,179
This one is different.

455
00:36:59,586 --> 00:37:01,065
Are you testing me ?

456
00:37:02,266 --> 00:37:04,734
Not exactly.
We had reason to believe....

457
00:37:04,866 --> 00:37:06,697
I have to take tests now ?

458
00:37:09,666 --> 00:37:10,781
Ongoing case ?

459
00:37:10,866 --> 00:37:12,060
Six months.

460
00:37:13,546 --> 00:37:15,184
The scene is disorganized.

461
00:37:15,266 --> 00:37:18,542
The killer lives nearby.
He would've been too disoriented to drive.

462
00:37:18,626 --> 00:37:23,097
You have two possibilities : One is
a mental patient, the other is a boyfriend.

463
00:37:23,266 --> 00:37:25,826
Someone who was denied sex
on this occasion...

464
00:37:25,906 --> 00:37:27,464
who knew and cared about her.

465
00:37:27,546 --> 00:37:28,865
He beat the shit out of her.

466
00:37:28,946 --> 00:37:30,538
But he felt remorse.

467
00:37:31,026 --> 00:37:34,382
He covered her up afterward,
because he felt conflicted.

468
00:37:35,506 --> 00:37:37,064
Not like this man.

469
00:37:37,826 --> 00:37:41,136
These are the work of someone
who is not conflicted at all.

470
00:37:41,226 --> 00:37:43,581
He's doing exactly
what he wants to do.

471
00:37:43,706 --> 00:37:44,934
Highly organized.

472
00:37:45,026 --> 00:37:48,098
I'll bet there were no prints,
no stains, no blood.

473
00:37:48,546 --> 00:37:49,183
Right.

474
00:37:49,266 --> 00:37:52,303
No sign of forced entry.
He probably conned his way in.

475
00:37:52,786 --> 00:37:54,856
They may or may not
be about sex...

476
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:56,664
but they're about power.

477
00:37:56,746 --> 00:37:59,340
See the multiple thumbprints
along the throat ?

478
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:01,578
Was the hyoid bone broken ?

479
00:38:01,666 --> 00:38:03,065
Yes, it was.

480
00:38:03,146 --> 00:38:06,661
He strangles them face to face,
so they can see his power...

481
00:38:06,786 --> 00:38:09,254
and he can watch their terror.
That gets him off.

482
00:38:09,346 --> 00:38:11,416
Then he revives
them and does it again.

483
00:38:11,506 --> 00:38:16,216
Look for an intelligent white male,
20 to 30 years old, socially functional...

484
00:38:16,626 --> 00:38:19,459
with a major interest
in golden oldies.

485
00:38:23,146 --> 00:38:24,499
Did I pass ?

486
00:38:24,786 --> 00:38:27,425
You passed.
What do you mean by golden oldies ?

487
00:38:28,226 --> 00:38:31,423
Where's the stocking
that was tied around this one's neck ?

488
00:38:31,906 --> 00:38:33,134
How'd you know that ?

489
00:38:33,226 --> 00:38:35,979
I mean, I assume it was a stocking
and not pantyhose...

490
00:38:36,066 --> 00:38:37,943
tied in a big loopy bow...

491
00:38:38,026 --> 00:38:39,425
like this one.

492
00:38:40,906 --> 00:38:41,577
Right.

493
00:38:41,666 --> 00:38:44,624
For goodness sakes,
it's the Boston Strangler.

494
00:38:44,866 --> 00:38:49,018
He's imitating Albert DeSalvo's
crime scene down to the kinky details.

495
00:38:49,186 --> 00:38:52,098
This guy's copycatting a serial killer
who's been dead for....

496
00:38:52,186 --> 00:38:53,460
Twenty years.

497
00:38:53,546 --> 00:38:56,106
Why DeSalvo ? Why not somebody
in the news recently ?

498
00:38:56,186 --> 00:38:57,778
Gacy or Ramirez ?

499
00:38:58,426 --> 00:38:59,620
I don't know.

500
00:38:59,826 --> 00:39:01,976
These guys are like viruses.

501
00:39:02,466 --> 00:39:04,855
There's always some new mutation.

502
00:39:41,186 --> 00:39:44,701
The commissioner is up my ass,
saying we could use help here.

503
00:39:44,826 --> 00:39:47,863
We could use help.
We need their VICAP, we need their...

504
00:39:48,266 --> 00:39:50,063
database thingies.

505
00:39:50,306 --> 00:39:52,820
The FBI will bury you
with fucking help.

506
00:39:52,906 --> 00:39:54,225
During Patty Hearst...

507
00:39:54,306 --> 00:39:58,060
some kid with a crew cut
took over my office for a month.

508
00:39:58,266 --> 00:40:00,063
So, you're saying... ?

509
00:40:00,866 --> 00:40:02,663
I'm saying, if you need help...

510
00:40:02,746 --> 00:40:05,704
Nikko is almost through
with the Chinatown thing.

511
00:40:05,786 --> 00:40:08,220
That really won't be necessary, sir.

512
00:40:08,866 --> 00:40:10,458
Join us. We need you.

513
00:40:10,626 --> 00:40:12,617
Anyone with a similar profile
to the Strangler.

514
00:40:12,706 --> 00:40:14,697
Or with a German wife.
Can you do that ?

515
00:40:14,786 --> 00:40:17,095
Anyone who wears green pants....

516
00:40:17,666 --> 00:40:19,019
The files in from Boston, yet ?

517
00:40:19,106 --> 00:40:21,062
Should be here tomorrow.

518
00:40:21,666 --> 00:40:23,099
What are you up to ?

519
00:40:23,186 --> 00:40:24,301
Going to Chinatown.

520
00:40:24,386 --> 00:40:26,536
Sit in on this for a minute.

521
00:40:29,386 --> 00:40:30,978
What do you got ?

522
00:40:46,746 --> 00:40:47,781
Winning ?

523
00:40:48,386 --> 00:40:49,899
I'm pulverizing him.

524
00:40:49,986 --> 00:40:51,419
All right, I'm off.

525
00:40:51,786 --> 00:40:53,663
- See you.
- Have a good time.

526
00:40:54,186 --> 00:40:55,778
I won't wait up.

527
00:40:59,306 --> 00:41:00,534
Got you.

528
00:42:21,706 --> 00:42:22,821
She's next.

529
00:42:22,946 --> 00:42:23,981
How do you know ?

530
00:42:24,066 --> 00:42:26,102
'Cause I watched her face
change to that.

531
00:42:26,186 --> 00:42:27,983
Did you try to play it back ?

532
00:42:28,386 --> 00:42:29,865
How did he send this to you ?

533
00:42:29,946 --> 00:42:31,743
He hacked into
her Internet address.

534
00:42:31,826 --> 00:42:33,418
Can we trace it ?

535
00:42:33,746 --> 00:42:35,737
- Only if he's online right now.
- He ain't.

536
00:42:35,826 --> 00:42:37,305
Can we rewind or... ?

537
00:42:38,466 --> 00:42:40,855
Yeah, we should be able
to play it back.

538
00:42:41,386 --> 00:42:43,422
- How long is the program ?
- Thirty seconds.

539
00:42:43,506 --> 00:42:46,703
- Can we get a copy of that face ?
- No, it's too big a file.

540
00:42:47,146 --> 00:42:48,738
Back up to tape.

541
00:42:49,666 --> 00:42:53,625
She's got a tape backup.
We can make a copy and take it with us.

542
00:42:53,866 --> 00:42:55,777
How do you know all this ?

543
00:42:55,946 --> 00:42:58,540
Misspent youth in video arcades,
I guess.

544
00:42:59,426 --> 00:43:00,939
A lot of quarters.

545
00:43:03,266 --> 00:43:04,745
Why would he send this to you ?

546
00:43:04,826 --> 00:43:05,895
Why do you think ?

547
00:43:05,986 --> 00:43:07,305
No one mentioned your involvement.

548
00:43:07,386 --> 00:43:10,264
There is no involvement.
I'm not involved !

549
00:43:10,426 --> 00:43:13,099
This is a game they play.
They hang around watching the cops...

550
00:43:13,186 --> 00:43:14,539
feeling superior to them.

551
00:43:14,626 --> 00:43:16,856
Instead of catching him,
you led him to me.

552
00:43:16,946 --> 00:43:19,221
He didn't write to me,
he wrote to you. Why ?

553
00:43:19,306 --> 00:43:21,217
Because I'm their
damn pinup girl.

554
00:43:21,306 --> 00:43:24,662
They all know me. They have libraries.
They collect clippings.

555
00:43:24,746 --> 00:43:26,976
I'm the muse of serial killers.

556
00:43:44,226 --> 00:43:45,545
Try the C drive.

557
00:43:46,106 --> 00:43:47,937
Any other suggestions ?

558
00:43:48,466 --> 00:43:50,616
It's gone.
The file is not here.

559
00:43:51,106 --> 00:43:53,939
It's not on C drive,
and it's not in List.

560
00:43:54,746 --> 00:43:56,782
You think he put a virus in there ?

561
00:43:57,186 --> 00:43:58,904
- Yeah.
- What exactly is... ?

562
00:43:59,026 --> 00:44:02,018
He wrote a virus into the program.
If you try to copy it, it's erased.

563
00:44:02,106 --> 00:44:03,175
He booby-trapped it !

564
00:44:03,266 --> 00:44:04,938
I must hand it to the guy.

565
00:44:05,106 --> 00:44:08,701
- He's a smart motherfucker.
- Do you remember what she looked like ?

566
00:44:09,626 --> 00:44:10,695
Yes.

567
00:44:10,906 --> 00:44:12,658
She looked like a girl.

568
00:44:12,746 --> 00:44:14,976
She looked like a million
other girls.

569
00:44:17,266 --> 00:44:18,824
I barely saw her.

570
00:44:24,066 --> 00:44:27,695
I'm going to the office to get
a systems guy on this. Maybe Marty.

571
00:44:28,706 --> 00:44:29,821
What're you doing ?

572
00:44:29,906 --> 00:44:31,134
Unplugging this.

573
00:44:31,226 --> 00:44:33,740
It's an open window.
He can crawl in any time he likes.

574
00:44:33,826 --> 00:44:37,296
He comes in, we grab him.
It's the only lead we've got.

575
00:44:38,066 --> 00:44:39,294
And what am I ?

576
00:44:39,426 --> 00:44:41,337
The lamb tied to the stake ?

577
00:44:41,466 --> 00:44:44,583
This is the only space
that I have in the world.

578
00:44:45,626 --> 00:44:47,582
- You're not getting it.
- I'll get a guard here.

579
00:44:47,666 --> 00:44:49,304
I don't want a guard here !

580
00:44:49,386 --> 00:44:50,535
All right.

581
00:44:50,786 --> 00:44:52,936
- We're all working together.
- I'm not.

582
00:44:53,026 --> 00:44:55,176
I'm not working with anybody.

583
00:44:55,666 --> 00:45:00,217
Turn the monitor back on and I'll stay
until we figure out what's happening.

584
00:45:00,786 --> 00:45:02,458
- Go on.
- Catch you later.

585
00:45:03,466 --> 00:45:04,581
All right ?

586
00:45:05,706 --> 00:45:06,900
Heil, Hitler.

587
00:45:16,706 --> 00:45:20,460
I don't think he's going to send us
anything tonight. He's too busy.

588
00:45:24,986 --> 00:45:26,339
You want a drink ?

589
00:45:26,826 --> 00:45:28,100
No, thank you.

590
00:45:28,346 --> 00:45:29,574
On duty ?

591
00:45:30,346 --> 00:45:31,540
Always.

592
00:45:33,026 --> 00:45:34,141
So...

593
00:45:35,306 --> 00:45:37,900
What about you
and the wee inspector ?

594
00:45:40,706 --> 00:45:42,185
What about us ?

595
00:45:46,626 --> 00:45:47,854
Are you ?

596
00:45:49,106 --> 00:45:50,380
We're partners.

597
00:45:50,666 --> 00:45:51,735
Partners ?

598
00:45:51,866 --> 00:45:53,299
In every way ?

599
00:45:53,946 --> 00:45:55,015
Not yet.

600
00:45:57,706 --> 00:45:59,219
Self-confident.

601
00:46:00,306 --> 00:46:01,421
Actually, I'm...

602
00:46:01,506 --> 00:46:02,575
shy...

603
00:46:02,866 --> 00:46:03,855
selective.

604
00:46:03,946 --> 00:46:05,459
The trouble is I'm...

605
00:46:07,906 --> 00:46:09,544
I'm finding myself....

606
00:46:10,986 --> 00:46:13,739
You're in the witness category,
you see.

607
00:46:26,266 --> 00:46:27,858
In better times, maybe.

608
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:36,775
Peter !

609
00:46:41,066 --> 00:46:44,024
I've been calling and calling.
Didn't you hear me ?

610
00:46:45,146 --> 00:46:47,102
You completely forgot about me.

611
00:46:47,746 --> 00:46:50,385
Very thirsty, weren't you,
my little sweetie ?

612
00:46:51,026 --> 00:46:52,254
Come on.

613
00:46:52,586 --> 00:46:54,099
Are you teasing me ?

614
00:46:54,186 --> 00:46:55,744
Naughty little boy.

615
00:46:56,746 --> 00:46:59,658
What are you doing ?
Want to watch Letterman with me ?

616
00:47:00,106 --> 00:47:01,505
Well, I could, but....

617
00:47:01,586 --> 00:47:03,702
I don't watch talk shows
on my own.

618
00:47:03,786 --> 00:47:04,980
I know.

619
00:47:07,586 --> 00:47:08,814
Oh, go on.

620
00:47:08,906 --> 00:47:11,340
Go back to your
silly little computers.

621
00:47:12,386 --> 00:47:13,501
Thanks.

622
00:47:14,506 --> 00:47:16,497
Haven't you forgotten something ?

623
00:47:30,226 --> 00:47:31,341
I love you.

624
00:47:31,426 --> 00:47:32,779
Yeah, me, too.

625
00:48:47,746 --> 00:48:50,135
Look's like you're in a bit
of trouble.

626
00:48:52,066 --> 00:48:53,738
I'm going to place my hand...

627
00:48:53,826 --> 00:48:55,145
right here.

628
00:48:57,066 --> 00:48:59,375
I'm going to put my elbow
right here.

629
00:49:00,706 --> 00:49:01,900
Just...

630
00:49:04,026 --> 00:49:05,061
cut...

631
00:49:06,226 --> 00:49:07,261
there.

632
00:49:09,026 --> 00:49:10,141
There, now.

633
00:49:10,266 --> 00:49:12,700
Didn't I say
I'd take care of you ?

634
00:49:13,826 --> 00:49:15,498
Goodness ! You're so hot !

635
00:49:20,106 --> 00:49:22,939
This is going to hurt a little,
I'm afraid.

636
00:49:24,626 --> 00:49:26,184
They claim they didn't see anything.

637
00:49:26,266 --> 00:49:29,258
You received a call from dispatch
at 6:35 a.m. ?

638
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:33,379
Correct. 6:35. The first unit arrived
about 15 minutes later.

639
00:49:33,546 --> 00:49:34,661
Great.

640
00:49:34,746 --> 00:49:36,657
Did you isolate the kids
who found her ?

641
00:49:36,746 --> 00:49:39,214
Yes, they're over
on the side of the hill.

642
00:49:39,306 --> 00:49:41,183
How many of you knew her ?

643
00:49:41,346 --> 00:49:43,018
We just danced with her.

644
00:49:43,106 --> 00:49:44,221
Really ?

645
00:49:44,386 --> 00:49:46,297
You just met her tonight ?

646
00:49:48,146 --> 00:49:49,101
Excuse me.

647
00:49:49,186 --> 00:49:50,380
Good afternoon.

648
00:49:51,866 --> 00:49:54,334
Did you stand too far
from your razor today ?

649
00:49:55,346 --> 00:49:57,177
I was up all night
with a sick friend.

650
00:49:57,266 --> 00:49:59,097
I want to talk to you.

651
00:49:59,426 --> 00:50:02,099
Have you got a thing going
with MJ now ?

652
00:50:03,026 --> 00:50:04,698
I don't believe you.

653
00:50:04,866 --> 00:50:06,857
Good God, man, you stink.

654
00:50:07,506 --> 00:50:10,339
Heavy date last night ?
Are you screwing around on her already ?

655
00:50:10,426 --> 00:50:11,654
What's wrong with you ?

656
00:50:11,746 --> 00:50:14,738
Me ? I'll tell you,
you just treat her right.

657
00:50:15,866 --> 00:50:19,256
Don't go screwing around on her.
She doesn't deserve that.

658
00:50:20,226 --> 00:50:22,456
Remind me again why she dumped you.

659
00:50:28,506 --> 00:50:29,700
Why is he here ?

660
00:50:29,786 --> 00:50:32,220
What do you see ?
Tell me what you see.

661
00:50:33,826 --> 00:50:37,102
There are stains.
So, she's been sexually assaulted.

662
00:50:37,746 --> 00:50:41,375
No defense wounds. No ligature marks
or bruising, like the others.

663
00:50:41,466 --> 00:50:42,694
Very cyanotic.

664
00:50:42,786 --> 00:50:44,265
Asphyxiation, huh ?

665
00:50:44,386 --> 00:50:47,059
- Doesn't look like our guy.
- You don't think so ?

666
00:50:47,146 --> 00:50:48,818
Look at her heels.

667
00:50:49,346 --> 00:50:51,701
There's abrasions, but no bleeding.

668
00:50:51,786 --> 00:50:53,663
- She's been dragged up here postmortem.
- Maybe.

669
00:50:53,746 --> 00:50:56,943
On this stuff we're not going to get
any prints or tracks.

670
00:50:57,146 --> 00:50:58,374
Long night ?

671
00:50:58,466 --> 00:51:00,741
- Don't you start.
- What about her arms ?

672
00:51:03,906 --> 00:51:05,419
There's needle marks.

673
00:51:05,506 --> 00:51:07,736
No tracks. Not a regular user.

674
00:51:07,866 --> 00:51:10,141
Probably so stoned,
she never knew what got her.

675
00:51:10,226 --> 00:51:11,375
Hope so.

676
00:51:11,746 --> 00:51:13,577
A lot of little hippie girls.

677
00:51:13,946 --> 00:51:17,495
They all want to make love.
They all want to be beautiful.

678
00:51:17,666 --> 00:51:19,258
That's your type, right ?

679
00:51:20,546 --> 00:51:21,899
What're you doing ?

680
00:51:21,986 --> 00:51:23,977
Want to be on the 6:00 news ?

681
00:51:24,066 --> 00:51:26,660
Go down and
finish taking statements.

682
00:51:35,146 --> 00:51:36,545
Let's get out of here.

683
00:51:46,106 --> 00:51:48,301
I know.
They found another one.

684
00:51:48,746 --> 00:51:50,702
What ?
Ruben told you already ?

685
00:51:50,786 --> 00:51:52,697
I heard it on my scanner.

686
00:51:53,466 --> 00:51:55,297
- Can I use your phone ?
- Sure.

687
00:51:55,826 --> 00:51:58,659
They want you to call the office ?
Your phone is busted.

688
00:51:58,746 --> 00:52:00,384
You're some piece of work.

689
00:52:00,466 --> 00:52:03,503
I turned that damn scanner off,
and then I turned it on again.

690
00:52:03,586 --> 00:52:07,579
I can't listen to it, but I can't
not listen to it. So I make Andy do it.

691
00:52:07,746 --> 00:52:11,216
Are you on medication ?
I need your whole brain on duty.

692
00:52:12,226 --> 00:52:13,659
I'm not on duty.

693
00:52:13,786 --> 00:52:15,424
Neither is my brain.

694
00:52:15,826 --> 00:52:18,215
Everything is different.
Different guy.

695
00:52:19,106 --> 00:52:21,301
She was asphyxiated, not strangled...

696
00:52:21,426 --> 00:52:24,099
dumped outdoors,
sexually assaulted.

697
00:52:25,026 --> 00:52:26,698
So, nothing like DeSalvo.

698
00:52:26,786 --> 00:52:28,583
Completely different.

699
00:52:29,426 --> 00:52:31,496
Monahan. Messages, please.

700
00:52:32,266 --> 00:52:33,585
Why do you need me ?

701
00:52:33,666 --> 00:52:35,418
I think I'm wrong...

702
00:52:35,906 --> 00:52:38,864
because something
was artificial about it.

703
00:52:39,146 --> 00:52:41,341
Like posed.
She was on display.

704
00:52:41,586 --> 00:52:44,544
Why drag a body
all the way up a huge hill...

705
00:52:45,226 --> 00:52:47,535
where it will be found
by tourists ?

706
00:52:47,706 --> 00:52:50,140
You think he's changed
his routine ?

707
00:52:50,506 --> 00:52:52,224
That doesn't happen.

708
00:52:54,026 --> 00:52:55,584
These men are robotic.

709
00:52:55,786 --> 00:52:59,301
The murder's a ritual.
The method is part of the pleasure.

710
00:52:59,666 --> 00:53:01,577
Why is that computer off ?

711
00:53:02,306 --> 00:53:03,659
Because I turned it off.

712
00:53:03,746 --> 00:53:05,179
You can't do that.

713
00:53:05,666 --> 00:53:07,258
I believe I can.

714
00:53:07,866 --> 00:53:10,619
- But would you like me to turn it back on ?
- Yeah.

715
00:53:15,546 --> 00:53:16,774
Hello, Ruben.

716
00:53:16,946 --> 00:53:20,336
Please thank Inspector Goetz
for taking care of me last night.

717
00:53:21,386 --> 00:53:25,015
Dr. Hudson wants me to thank you
for taking care of her last night.

718
00:53:31,386 --> 00:53:33,456
Lab results on the new one.

719
00:53:35,226 --> 00:53:36,944
Two kinds of sperm.

720
00:53:38,906 --> 00:53:40,134
I guess that's...

721
00:53:40,226 --> 00:53:41,659
a gang thing.

722
00:53:43,266 --> 00:53:45,336
Thanks for the use of your phone.

723
00:53:53,706 --> 00:53:55,617
There were two kinds of sperm ?

724
00:53:58,586 --> 00:54:01,305
They said one was a secretor,
the other was not.

725
00:54:02,866 --> 00:54:04,538
How'd you know about that ?

726
00:54:04,666 --> 00:54:06,497
There were needle marks ?

727
00:54:09,986 --> 00:54:11,419
On her right arm ?

728
00:54:12,986 --> 00:54:15,181
So far, nothing they test for
comes out positive.

729
00:54:15,266 --> 00:54:17,985
Was the body found
near a "No Dumping" sign ?

730
00:54:19,266 --> 00:54:20,415
Like this ?

731
00:54:23,546 --> 00:54:25,104
I could've taken that picture.

732
00:54:25,186 --> 00:54:26,904
Shit. He switched.

733
00:54:27,426 --> 00:54:30,065
From DeSalvo to Bianchi and Buono.
The Hillside Strangler.

734
00:54:30,146 --> 00:54:32,979
Two men. Two kinds of sperm.
Very witty, our guy.

735
00:54:33,306 --> 00:54:35,615
You said that they're like robots...

736
00:54:35,706 --> 00:54:38,743
Yeah, but "consistency
is the hobgoblin of small minds."

737
00:54:38,826 --> 00:54:43,024
Tell them to test for chemicals found
in window cleaner: ammonia, ethanol....

738
00:54:43,666 --> 00:54:45,736
It's what they injected into victims.

739
00:54:45,826 --> 00:54:48,340
Why these guys ?
Why in such detail ?

740
00:54:49,506 --> 00:54:51,064
He wants to dazzle us.

741
00:54:51,226 --> 00:54:53,820
Anyone can strangle
someone in a tub.

742
00:54:54,426 --> 00:54:56,223
He's saying, "Look out.

743
00:54:56,546 --> 00:54:58,423
"I'm just getting started."

744
00:54:58,666 --> 00:54:59,655
<i>In San Francisco...</i>

745
00:54:59,746 --> 00:55:02,658

754

756
00:55:35,506 --> 00:55:38,259

757
00:56:06,266 --> 00:56:07,745
Oh, hi. Sorry.

758
00:56:07,826 --> 00:56:10,340
I'm a little lost.
Can you help me out ?

759
00:56:10,746 --> 00:56:11,895
Yeah, sure.

760
00:56:15,906 --> 00:56:17,021
Thanks.

761
00:56:17,346 --> 00:56:20,895

764
00:56:26,306 --> 00:56:27,534
Got you.

765
00:56:27,986 --> 00:56:29,214
It's a beauty.

766
00:56:29,346 --> 00:56:30,415
Great.

767
00:56:30,586 --> 00:56:32,144
I'll look at it soon.

768
00:56:41,466 --> 00:56:43,980
You thought you heard a backfire ?
Where were you ?

769
00:56:44,066 --> 00:56:46,944
I was just waiting to cross the street,
going east.

770
00:56:47,426 --> 00:56:48,745
Excuse me.

771
00:56:51,626 --> 00:56:52,775
<i>Hi, it's me, Helen.</i>

772
00:56:52,866 --> 00:56:54,618
Look, this isn't a good time.

773
00:56:54,706 --> 00:56:57,015
<i>It's a woman shot in a car, right ?</i>

774
00:56:57,346 --> 00:56:59,462
No, it looks like a drive-by.

775
00:56:59,626 --> 00:57:02,857
She's in a parked car, shot in the head,
no sexual assault.

776
00:57:02,986 --> 00:57:04,305
<i>Which side is she on ?</i>

777
00:57:04,386 --> 00:57:07,378
- Look, I really got to...
<i>- Was it the passenger's side ?</i>

778
00:57:07,546 --> 00:57:08,615
Yeah.

779
00:57:08,786 --> 00:57:10,344
<i>Was the tape player on ?</i>

780
00:57:10,426 --> 00:57:12,781
I don't know. Was the tape player on
when you got here ?

781
00:57:12,866 --> 00:57:16,461
Yeah, it was. It was driving me crazy,
so I shut it off.

782
00:57:17,426 --> 00:57:19,701
<i>Okay.
Switch it on, would you ?</i>

783
00:57:21,826 --> 00:57:22,497
It's still warm.

784
00:57:22,586 --> 00:57:25,737
Don't laugh, but I think it might be
the Partridge Family.

785
00:57:27,186 --> 00:57:28,778
Put the tape player on.

786
00:57:28,906 --> 00:57:31,500
Helen thinks it might be
the Partridge Family.

787
00:57:38,466 --> 00:57:39,945
Don't hang up.

788
00:57:40,386 --> 00:57:42,297
Is a gas station nearby ?

789
00:57:43,586 --> 00:57:45,304
<i>With a phone booth ?</i>

790
00:57:45,506 --> 00:57:46,985
Go look for a note.

791
00:57:48,386 --> 00:57:50,980
Here.
I got to go check the pay phone.

792
00:58:16,386 --> 00:58:18,297
It's Berkowitz, isn't it ?

793
00:58:20,106 --> 00:58:21,824
He's doing Son of Sam.

794
00:58:22,466 --> 00:58:25,663
She was sitting in a parked car
when she was shot.

795
00:58:26,346 --> 00:58:27,665
Look in the crowd.

796
00:58:27,746 --> 00:58:30,214
Berkowitz liked to watch cops work.

797
00:59:14,546 --> 00:59:16,298
Helen, we found a note.

798
00:59:16,706 --> 00:59:19,937
It says, "Police, let me haunt you
with these words : I'll be back."

799
00:59:20,026 --> 00:59:21,220
It's to Helen.

800
00:59:21,306 --> 00:59:22,819
I'm going over there.

801
00:59:23,706 --> 00:59:28,097
I know it's kind of late, but Ruben's
going to drop by with a few questions.

802
00:59:28,226 --> 00:59:30,786
Look, I've got to go,
so I'll see you later.

803
00:59:38,066 --> 00:59:39,943
Inspector Monahan, Homicide.

804
00:59:42,706 --> 00:59:45,379
I need a 10-25 to Pier One, Fort Mason.

805
00:59:45,946 --> 00:59:48,335
Approach Code 2.
Wait for instructions.

806
00:59:48,546 --> 00:59:51,140
Alert the officer
on security duty there.

807
01:00:20,706 --> 01:00:22,742
Just steal the car and go.

808
01:00:25,866 --> 01:00:26,935
Burt ?

809
01:03:53,026 --> 01:03:55,256
I'll deal with you later,
asshole.

810
01:03:57,106 --> 01:03:59,256
You must think
I'm a complete moron !

811
01:03:59,666 --> 01:04:02,578
Until we know better,
I say the guy's just a junkie.

812
01:04:02,666 --> 01:04:03,735
A junkie ?

813
01:04:03,866 --> 01:04:07,381
In a full-on SWAT suit ?
Ruben, you're such a lousy liar.

814
01:04:07,746 --> 01:04:09,259
Are you sure nothing's missing ?

815
01:04:09,346 --> 01:04:12,543
Yes, there is ! The cop
who was supposed to be at my door !

816
01:04:12,666 --> 01:04:13,576
Where was he ?

817
01:04:13,666 --> 01:04:15,782
He screwed up.
That's not the point.

818
01:04:15,866 --> 01:04:19,302
It is ! You dragged me into this,
you're supposed to protect me.

819
01:04:19,706 --> 01:04:20,775
What're you doing ?

820
01:04:20,866 --> 01:04:22,345
I'm checking the bed !

821
01:04:23,346 --> 01:04:25,940
That man is in and out
when he feels like it !

822
01:04:26,146 --> 01:04:28,706
We got here as quickly
as we could, okay ?

823
01:04:28,826 --> 01:04:30,100
Fortunately...

824
01:04:30,186 --> 01:04:34,179
Why is that ? Why did you come
to my rescue so fortuitously, huh ?

825
01:04:40,946 --> 01:04:43,983
There was a note, wasn't there ?
At the gas station.

826
01:04:44,826 --> 01:04:46,657
I was right.
What'd it say ?

827
01:04:48,586 --> 01:04:52,056
You think the guy's been
in here before ? You said that.

828
01:04:53,026 --> 01:04:54,459
I don't know.

829
01:04:55,266 --> 01:04:57,541
Someone came and messed
with my clothes.

830
01:04:58,186 --> 01:05:00,700
And they put this red suit of mine
on the bed.

831
01:05:00,786 --> 01:05:02,299
Anything special about it ?

832
01:05:02,386 --> 01:05:04,581
It was the one I was wearing...

833
01:05:04,746 --> 01:05:06,384
at the lecture hall.

834
01:05:07,586 --> 01:05:08,655
Why didn't you report it ?

835
01:05:08,746 --> 01:05:10,225
I didn't know.

836
01:05:10,506 --> 01:05:12,895
I thought it was me, you know....

837
01:05:13,946 --> 01:05:16,904
I had taken a lot of pills
and I had been drinking.

838
01:05:17,466 --> 01:05:20,822
I just didn't know.
I wasn't sure then, but I am now !

839
01:05:20,906 --> 01:05:23,864
So stop pretending to me
that it's a burglar !

840
01:05:24,346 --> 01:05:28,339
Stop treating me like I'm some
fucking idiot ! Tell me the truth !

841
01:05:33,026 --> 01:05:35,904
I think the man who has killed
five women in this city...

842
01:05:35,986 --> 01:05:37,704
was just in your apartment.

843
01:05:37,786 --> 01:05:39,424
I don't know why.

844
01:05:39,786 --> 01:05:43,574
But I do know he has a plan,
and you seem to be a part of it.

845
01:05:47,586 --> 01:05:51,056
The truth is he's very smart,
and he's way ahead of us.

846
01:05:52,666 --> 01:05:55,624
And I take it your moving is
out of the question ?

847
01:05:58,146 --> 01:05:59,943
So, all I know to do...

848
01:06:00,186 --> 01:06:03,861
is run the usual checks,
change your locks, tighten security...

849
01:06:03,946 --> 01:06:05,220
and pray.

850
01:06:08,226 --> 01:06:09,375
Feel better ?

851
01:06:12,146 --> 01:06:13,181
No.

852
01:06:14,626 --> 01:06:16,821
But I appreciate your candor.

853
01:06:21,426 --> 01:06:23,417
When do I get to see this note ?

854
01:06:24,586 --> 01:06:27,225
<i>Once that you've decided
on a killing</i>

855
01:06:28,866 --> 01:06:31,460
<i>First you make a stone
of your heart</i>

856
01:06:33,466 --> 01:06:36,663
<i>And if you find
that your hands are still willing</i>

857
01:06:38,306 --> 01:06:40,820
<i>Then you can turn a murder into art</i>

858
01:06:43,106 --> 01:06:45,939
<i>There really isn't any
need for bloodshed</i>

859
01:06:47,786 --> 01:06:50,425
<i>Just do it with a little more finesse</i>

860
01:06:52,586 --> 01:06:55,783
<i>If you can slip that tablet
into someone's coffee</i>

861
01:06:57,306 --> 01:06:59,820
<i>Then it avoids an awful lot of mess</i>

862
01:07:01,666 --> 01:07:03,941
<i>Because it's murder by numbers</i>

863
01:07:04,746 --> 01:07:06,304
<i>One, two, three</i>

864
01:07:06,746 --> 01:07:08,577
<i>It's as easy to learn</i>

865
01:07:08,946 --> 01:07:10,459
<i>As your A-B-Cs</i>

866
01:07:11,186 --> 01:07:13,142
<i>It's murder by numbers</i>

867
01:07:20,586 --> 01:07:22,304
Good morning, Commissioner.

868
01:07:22,866 --> 01:07:24,060
Good morning.

869
01:07:24,466 --> 01:07:26,502
Murder By Numbers, by The Police.

870
01:07:26,826 --> 01:07:30,705
Obviously, the killer wants us to hear
this song for reasons other than...

871
01:07:30,786 --> 01:07:32,583
music appreciation.

872
01:07:32,946 --> 01:07:34,698
Familiarize yourselves
with the lyrics.

873
01:07:34,786 --> 01:07:37,664
We need to figure out
what he's trying to tell us.

874
01:07:37,946 --> 01:07:40,858
I think that about covers it.
Anything else ?

875
01:07:41,146 --> 01:07:42,465
Yes, Inspector ?

876
01:07:42,586 --> 01:07:45,498
We're set up on Helen's phone line
so we can monitor calls...

877
01:07:45,586 --> 01:07:47,781
and anything coming to her modem.

878
01:07:48,386 --> 01:07:49,705
Questions ?

879
01:08:05,546 --> 01:08:07,298
He is not a happy camper.

880
01:08:07,946 --> 01:08:09,982
- The Hudson broad.
- What about her ?

881
01:08:10,466 --> 01:08:14,744
The commissioner thinks, and I agree,
that she's leaking like a rusty bucket.

882
01:08:16,226 --> 01:08:18,581
Maybe she's trying to hype her new book.
I don't know.

883
01:08:18,666 --> 01:08:21,783
She's just not reliable.
Especially after lunch.

884
01:08:22,026 --> 01:08:25,018
She has been really useful to us
on this case.

885
01:08:26,266 --> 01:08:28,939
I don't want you discussing
this case with her...

886
01:08:29,026 --> 01:08:31,221
in any shape, way or form.

887
01:08:31,426 --> 01:08:32,984
Do I make myself clear ?

888
01:08:33,066 --> 01:08:33,816
Crystal, sir.

889
01:08:48,266 --> 01:08:49,665
Did that help any ?

890
01:08:50,226 --> 01:08:52,103
You don't feel fear, do you ?

891
01:08:53,226 --> 01:08:56,616
One of those people who thinks
everything happens for a reason.

892
01:08:56,706 --> 01:08:58,617
And we're all "God's chillun".

893
01:08:58,946 --> 01:08:59,742
How nice.

894
01:08:59,826 --> 01:09:02,624
I put my ass on the line
to bring you that letter.

895
01:09:03,426 --> 01:09:05,337
Are you gonna help me or not ?

896
01:09:09,386 --> 01:09:11,297
"Helen, don't lose your head."

897
01:09:11,906 --> 01:09:13,942
So, we're on a first-name basis.

898
01:09:15,266 --> 01:09:18,099
Is it a threat ?
Does he want to cut off my head ?

899
01:09:19,106 --> 01:09:20,664
Dahmer cut off heads.

900
01:09:20,986 --> 01:09:21,975
Kemper.

901
01:09:23,066 --> 01:09:24,784
I think Rifkin did.

902
01:09:26,026 --> 01:09:27,664
I'm sorry. It's difficult.

903
01:09:27,746 --> 01:09:29,702
It's okay. Take your time.

904
01:09:34,946 --> 01:09:37,335
"First you make a stone
of your heart."

905
01:09:37,706 --> 01:09:40,300
That's the first step :
dissociation.

906
01:09:40,706 --> 01:09:43,459
He's saying he's suffered.
Now it's our turn.

907
01:09:45,466 --> 01:09:46,945
What made a stone of his heart ?

908
01:09:47,026 --> 01:09:50,098
Usually it's rejection or humiliation
by a parent.

909
01:09:50,466 --> 01:09:52,582
Gacy's father beat him for fun.

910
01:09:52,786 --> 01:09:56,699
Kemper's mother locked him
in a cellar when he reached puberty.

911
01:09:56,906 --> 01:09:58,862
Something happened to this one.

912
01:09:59,786 --> 01:10:01,219
Are these his first killings ?

913
01:10:01,306 --> 01:10:02,500
I think they are.

914
01:10:02,586 --> 01:10:04,417
He's thought about them.

915
01:10:06,386 --> 01:10:08,104
This guy's copycatting.

916
01:10:08,226 --> 01:10:09,898
He wants what those killers got.

917
01:10:09,986 --> 01:10:12,375
Fame, the power to terrify us....

918
01:10:12,826 --> 01:10:16,580
To take whoever, whatever he wants
without saying, "Please. "

919
01:10:19,786 --> 01:10:23,540
"And if you find that your hands
are still willing, you can turn murder...

920
01:10:23,626 --> 01:10:25,025
"into art."

921
01:10:25,346 --> 01:10:27,906
He wants us to think
what he's doing is art.

922
01:10:28,226 --> 01:10:30,694
We're looking for someone
desperate for acceptance.

923
01:10:30,786 --> 01:10:33,300
Probably has a fair academic record.

924
01:10:34,066 --> 01:10:36,057
And I think has a technical job.

925
01:10:37,146 --> 01:10:39,944
Something that demands
a certain precision.

926
01:11:06,946 --> 01:11:09,540
"Flushed with your
very first success...

927
01:11:09,666 --> 01:11:12,180
"you must try a twosome
or a threesome...

928
01:11:12,386 --> 01:11:15,583
"and you'll find your conscience
bothers you much less."

929
01:11:15,746 --> 01:11:17,384
A gruesome twosome.

930
01:11:17,626 --> 01:11:19,298
Kemper did two in one day.

931
01:11:19,386 --> 01:11:20,978
Bundy did three.

932
01:11:21,666 --> 01:11:25,818
Boston Strangler, Hillside Strangler...
Does the order mean anything?

933
01:11:25,986 --> 01:11:28,819
It's not chronological.
Son of Sam was before Hillside.

934
01:11:28,906 --> 01:11:31,625
He's sending you letters
like he's daring us to nail him.

935
01:11:31,706 --> 01:11:34,061
If he wants to be famous,
he must be caught.

936
01:11:34,146 --> 01:11:36,262
So you can write a book
about him.

937
01:12:40,066 --> 01:12:41,419
Good grief.

938
01:13:43,986 --> 01:13:45,624
Thanks. Stick around.

939
01:13:50,226 --> 01:13:52,217
It's lousy, but it's hot.

940
01:13:52,826 --> 01:13:53,576
Thanks.

941
01:13:53,666 --> 01:13:55,065
Are you all right ?

942
01:13:59,066 --> 01:14:00,704
He burnt the print off
the finger.

943
01:14:00,786 --> 01:14:02,378
What a surprise.

944
01:14:02,866 --> 01:14:04,857
He used it as a bookmark.

945
01:14:05,066 --> 01:14:07,534
The chapter where Daryll attacks
the doctor.

946
01:14:07,626 --> 01:14:11,141
We know that Mr. Cullum was safe
in San Quentin last night, so...

947
01:14:11,386 --> 01:14:13,456
why did this book
show up under the mattress ?

948
01:14:13,546 --> 01:14:15,264
I'll call you one better.

949
01:14:17,186 --> 01:14:18,505
It's autographed.

950
01:14:19,866 --> 01:14:21,902
"Hey Doc, hope you like the book.

951
01:14:21,986 --> 01:14:24,864
"Love and sloppy kisses,
Daryll Lee Cullum."

952
01:14:25,346 --> 01:14:26,825
What a cuddly !

953
01:14:34,186 --> 01:14:35,904
I know what you'll say.

954
01:14:37,466 --> 01:14:38,945
I'll do the talking.

955
01:14:42,826 --> 01:14:44,305
How you doing ?

956
01:14:46,786 --> 01:14:49,698
<i>I want you to look
into this little camera here...</i>

957
01:14:50,466 --> 01:14:52,934
<i>Now I want you to speak
into this microphone.</i>

958
01:14:53,026 --> 01:14:54,903
She'll see me through that ?

959
01:14:55,626 --> 01:14:58,459
- How she gonna hear me ?
<i>- Speak into the microphone.</i>

960
01:14:59,226 --> 01:15:00,215
Hello.

961
01:15:00,466 --> 01:15:01,660
Hey, Doc.

962
01:15:04,786 --> 01:15:08,062
I'm Inspector Monahan.
I'll be speaking for Dr. Hudson.

963
01:15:08,186 --> 01:15:09,619
I'm hanging up.

964
01:15:09,826 --> 01:15:11,498
I ain't talking to a cop.

965
01:15:11,706 --> 01:15:15,016
Dr. Hudson just got your book.
Do you know anything about it ?

966
01:15:15,266 --> 01:15:16,984
I surely do, but...

967
01:15:17,346 --> 01:15:20,702
that's all I'll say till that
foxy lady gets on the horn.

968
01:15:20,866 --> 01:15:21,981
Put her on.

969
01:15:25,946 --> 01:15:27,220
Hello, Mr. Cullum.

970
01:15:27,306 --> 01:15:28,341
Doc !

971
01:15:29,306 --> 01:15:31,376
I've been expecting your call.

972
01:15:32,306 --> 01:15:34,536
From one author to another,
how'd you like my book ?

973
01:15:34,626 --> 01:15:36,776
What do you know
about the man who delivered it ?

974
01:15:36,866 --> 01:15:38,015
Peter Kurten ?

975
01:15:38,106 --> 01:15:39,459
What about him ?

976
01:15:39,746 --> 01:15:41,179
Peter Kurten ?

977
01:15:44,506 --> 01:15:48,419
Peter Kurten is the name of a
serial killer from the 30s in Germany.

978
01:15:48,546 --> 01:15:50,776
Damn, he took that man's name.

979
01:15:51,786 --> 01:15:53,378
Is he bothering you ?

980
01:15:53,826 --> 01:15:56,386
He broke into my apartment
to leave your book.

981
01:15:56,546 --> 01:15:58,138
Kind of a hand-delivery ?

982
01:15:58,266 --> 01:15:59,904
Did you put him up to it ?

983
01:16:00,466 --> 01:16:03,424
This guy,
he's written me all these letters.

984
01:16:03,706 --> 01:16:05,583
I figured he owed me
a couple of favors.

985
01:16:05,666 --> 01:16:09,420
So I sent a book with him to your house.
I didn't think he'd break in.

986
01:16:09,546 --> 01:16:11,980
Steer clear of him.
He's a freak.

987
01:16:12,826 --> 01:16:16,455
He told me he's going to send me
$500 for some of my... spirit.

988
01:16:20,546 --> 01:16:23,856
He said that he can make me immortal
if he had some of my spirit.

989
01:16:23,946 --> 01:16:25,664
You know what I'm saying ?

990
01:16:26,306 --> 01:16:28,103
This is embarrassing.

991
01:16:28,626 --> 01:16:31,584
I don't want to say it right out
in front of a lady.

992
01:16:31,906 --> 01:16:35,057
I think I know what you're referring to.
What did you do about it ?

993
01:16:35,146 --> 01:16:37,899
I took some liquid soap,
put it in a sandwich baggie...

994
01:16:37,986 --> 01:16:40,784
with a message from Jesus
to mend his ways.

995
01:16:41,026 --> 01:16:42,698
How will you contact Kurten ?

996
01:16:42,786 --> 01:16:46,381
Buddy of mine got paroled.
I'll send the baggie with him.

997
01:16:47,106 --> 01:16:49,062
Kurten will hook up with him.

998
01:16:49,666 --> 01:16:51,543
Do you know when and where ?

999
01:16:51,626 --> 01:16:53,025
All depends.

1000
01:16:53,506 --> 01:16:55,019
Depends on what ?

1001
01:16:55,546 --> 01:16:58,060
It gets awful lonesome in here, Doc.

1002
01:16:58,626 --> 01:17:00,901
I think about you all the time.

1003
01:17:02,306 --> 01:17:04,422
A personal token would be nice.

1004
01:17:05,626 --> 01:17:06,615
Let's see...

1005
01:17:06,706 --> 01:17:07,900
something...

1006
01:17:08,546 --> 01:17:09,376
feminine...

1007
01:17:09,466 --> 01:17:12,856
something lacy, something frilly,
something pretty.

1008
01:17:14,026 --> 01:17:15,300
I got it.

1009
01:17:16,546 --> 01:17:19,060
Send me some of your squirrel covers.

1010
01:17:20,066 --> 01:17:21,499
I beg your pardon ?

1011
01:17:21,866 --> 01:17:23,538
"I beg your pardon ?"

1012
01:17:23,746 --> 01:17:25,179
Your panties.

1013
01:17:25,426 --> 01:17:28,065
You wear them, don't you ?
That's what I want.

1014
01:17:28,666 --> 01:17:30,736
I want them autographed
to me personally :

1015
01:17:30,826 --> 01:17:32,817
Daryll Lee Cullum.
Deal ?

1016
01:17:33,186 --> 01:17:34,505
That's a promise.

1017
01:17:34,586 --> 01:17:39,262
My buddy's meeting Peter tonight at 10:00
at the Danver Meat Packing Company.

1018
01:17:46,466 --> 01:17:47,819
How's life ?

1019
01:17:49,386 --> 01:17:52,059
How'd you like to get off
the Chinatown detail ?

1020
01:17:52,706 --> 01:17:55,584
We have a lead.
I think we can get this guy.

1021
01:17:55,826 --> 01:17:57,498
Yeah, I'll be right down.

1022
01:17:59,266 --> 01:18:03,418
<i>You've got to come talk to me,
because Jesus kept you alive for a reason.</i>

1023
01:18:03,826 --> 01:18:06,260
He knew Satan was in my heart,
raising my hand to kill you.

1024
01:18:06,346 --> 01:18:09,816
And Satan knew I had a good six,
seven years of appeals...

1025
01:18:09,906 --> 01:18:12,374
before they'd drop the
cyanide tablets.

1026
01:18:12,866 --> 01:18:14,822
And I'm just like Jesus.

1027
01:18:15,626 --> 01:18:17,423
I got disciples, too.

1028
01:18:18,266 --> 01:18:22,942
They're dying to do whatever I ask them,
as long as I just say the word, Doc.

1029
01:18:24,866 --> 01:18:27,141
I'm death and life to you, Doc.

1030
01:18:28,386 --> 01:18:29,899
Death and life.

1031
01:18:38,146 --> 01:18:41,104
- I speak Mandarin. They're Cantonese.
- How can I get a statement ?

1032
01:18:41,186 --> 01:18:42,824
I wish I could help.

1033
01:18:42,906 --> 01:18:44,578
I'll do anything you want.

1034
01:18:53,986 --> 01:18:55,658
You speak English ?

1035
01:18:57,826 --> 01:18:59,418
You speak any English ?

1036
01:18:59,626 --> 01:19:00,502
Let's go. Get up.

1037
01:19:00,586 --> 01:19:01,860
Fuck you.

1038
01:19:03,746 --> 01:19:05,464
Get your hands off me !

1039
01:19:36,266 --> 01:19:38,939
We're out of here, babe.
Say good night to Hal.

1040
01:19:39,586 --> 01:19:40,541
Good night.

1041
01:19:40,626 --> 01:19:42,742
You're going out in public
like that ?

1042
01:19:42,826 --> 01:19:45,340
Festival of Love.
Power to the people.

1043
01:19:45,426 --> 01:19:47,303
- Hang loose.
- Heavy. Far out.

1044
01:19:47,426 --> 01:19:49,018
Like, psychedelic.

1045
01:20:00,066 --> 01:20:01,101
Doughnut ?

1046
01:20:03,426 --> 01:20:04,495
Behave.

1047
01:20:04,746 --> 01:20:06,498
I'll send you to your room.

1048
01:20:06,586 --> 01:20:09,384
There's only glazed.
You can't have the chocolate.

1049
01:20:19,106 --> 01:20:21,017
Everybody take it easy.

1050
01:20:24,066 --> 01:20:26,375
Hold the gun down
so it doesn't go off.

1051
01:20:28,146 --> 01:20:29,625
Put up your weapons !

1052
01:20:29,706 --> 01:20:31,059
Weapons up.

1053
01:20:32,546 --> 01:20:34,776
Easy, easy.
Put the gun down.

1054
01:20:35,066 --> 01:20:36,943
Tell him to put the gun down.

1055
01:20:37,026 --> 01:20:37,902
I don't know how to say that.

1056
01:20:37,986 --> 01:20:39,339
Take it easy.

1057
01:20:50,546 --> 01:20:52,059
Nobody out that door !

1058
01:21:46,506 --> 01:21:47,461
Freeze !

1059
01:21:47,546 --> 01:21:49,377
- I'm a juvenile !
- Don't move !

1060
01:22:09,026 --> 01:22:10,778
<i>It's weird, you know...</i>

1061
01:22:11,266 --> 01:22:13,734
<i>You think you're going to
crash your car...</i>

1062
01:22:13,826 --> 01:22:17,296
<i>or go out in a blaze of glory
with some big bad guy.</i>

1063
01:22:17,826 --> 01:22:19,100
<i>And what happens ?</i>

1064
01:22:19,186 --> 01:22:20,585
<i>Some jerk...</i>

1065
01:22:20,906 --> 01:22:23,181
<i>forgets to lock his stupid drawer.</i>

1066
01:22:24,866 --> 01:22:28,495
I can't tell you how many times
I saw the two of you together....

1067
01:22:31,106 --> 01:22:35,657
I'd see you with your heads together.
He'd be making some kind of dumb joke.

1068
01:22:43,226 --> 01:22:44,375
I wished...

1069
01:22:49,506 --> 01:22:51,064
I wished him dead.

1070
01:22:51,586 --> 01:22:52,905
Every time.

1071
01:22:57,666 --> 01:22:58,860
You know what ?

1072
01:22:59,466 --> 01:23:03,095
The strange thing is,
I'd really give my life right now...

1073
01:23:04,186 --> 01:23:05,699
to bring him back.

1074
01:23:22,066 --> 01:23:24,341
You're in terrible trouble, Nikko.

1075
01:23:24,546 --> 01:23:26,025
Terrible trouble.

1076
01:23:26,266 --> 01:23:27,824
Who gives a fuck ?

1077
01:23:29,706 --> 01:23:30,934
I give a fuck.

1078
01:23:41,986 --> 01:23:44,546
You know that in all the years
I've known you...

1079
01:23:44,626 --> 01:23:46,457
I've never seen you cry.

1080
01:23:52,066 --> 01:23:56,059
He's on paid leave. I managed
to talk the commissioner out of no pay.

1081
01:24:01,946 --> 01:24:03,743
You take his, you take mine.

1082
01:24:04,026 --> 01:24:06,586
Now I'm supposed to lose
three good cops in one day ?

1083
01:24:06,666 --> 01:24:07,655
Sir...

1084
01:24:10,586 --> 01:24:12,861
I tried to control the situation.

1085
01:24:15,826 --> 01:24:18,294
I tried to control it.
I made a choice.

1086
01:24:22,466 --> 01:24:23,865
It didn't work out.

1087
01:24:26,346 --> 01:24:27,859
An officer got killed.

1088
01:24:27,946 --> 01:24:31,222
You made a decision,
and it was the right decision.

1089
01:24:32,066 --> 01:24:34,534
You just got the wrong result.
That's all.

1090
01:24:38,786 --> 01:24:40,663
You go out and you get drunk.

1091
01:24:41,506 --> 01:24:42,621
I am.

1092
01:24:48,666 --> 01:24:49,985
We missed him.

1093
01:24:50,306 --> 01:24:52,297
Jesus Christ !
How'd that happen ?

1094
01:24:52,386 --> 01:24:53,819
It was my fault.

1095
01:24:54,146 --> 01:24:55,579
I was so stupid.

1096
01:25:00,466 --> 01:25:02,058
We had a problem with....

1097
01:25:02,146 --> 01:25:03,420
Ruben's dead.

1098
01:25:09,186 --> 01:25:10,699
- Come in.
- No, really. I'm okay.

1099
01:25:10,786 --> 01:25:12,378
I thought you should hear it
from somebody...

1100
01:25:12,466 --> 01:25:14,855
instead of seeing it on the news,
because...

1101
01:25:14,946 --> 01:25:17,255
I know that you and he had...

1102
01:25:18,266 --> 01:25:19,460
a thing.

1103
01:25:21,666 --> 01:25:23,145
No, we didn't.

1104
01:25:27,506 --> 01:25:28,575
He was a...

1105
01:25:28,786 --> 01:25:30,014
sweet man.

1106
01:25:30,146 --> 01:25:31,818
I thought of him as a boy.

1107
01:25:32,066 --> 01:25:33,863
- Come in.
- No, I'm okay.

1108
01:25:33,946 --> 01:25:35,140
Come in for just a sec.

1109
01:25:35,226 --> 01:25:36,864
Answer the phone.

1110
01:25:37,146 --> 01:25:38,818
<i>Let me tell you something.</i>

1111
01:25:38,906 --> 01:25:42,057
<i>Nine out of ten serial killers
are white males...</i>

1112
01:25:42,666 --> 01:25:45,055
<i>aged 20 to 35,
just like these.</i>

1113
01:25:46,346 --> 01:25:50,419
<i>The FBI estimates that there could be
as many as 35 serial killers...</i>

1114
01:25:50,906 --> 01:25:53,340
<i>cruising for victims
even as I speak.</i>

1115
01:25:56,866 --> 01:25:58,060
Peter Kurten ?

1116
01:26:16,826 --> 01:26:17,815
Bitch !

1117
01:26:40,826 --> 01:26:44,341
Get the tap on Hudson's phone
and see if it traced a call two minutes ago.

1118
01:26:44,426 --> 01:26:46,303
There's a tap on my phone ?

1119
01:26:46,986 --> 01:26:48,544
Yeah, just this second.

1120
01:26:48,626 --> 01:26:50,617
Don't argue. Just do it.

1121
01:26:50,946 --> 01:26:53,938
Is it possible this guy was a student
of mine ?

1122
01:26:54,066 --> 01:26:55,897
Where'd you give this lecture ?

1123
01:26:55,986 --> 01:26:59,183
All over the country. Dozens of times.
It was my stock lecture.

1124
01:26:59,266 --> 01:27:01,655
When was the last time
you gave it here ?

1125
01:27:02,466 --> 01:27:05,299
Would have been last year,
just before...

1126
01:27:05,866 --> 01:27:07,379
I'm getting it.

1127
01:27:09,826 --> 01:27:11,817
That's it.
That's the order I gave it.

1128
01:27:11,906 --> 01:27:15,615
"DeSalvo, Bianchi and Buono,
Berkowitz, Dahmer." Dahmer's next.

1129
01:27:15,786 --> 01:27:17,742
Which means he'll kill a man
and after that...

1130
01:27:17,826 --> 01:27:19,544
He'll do Ted Bundy.

1131
01:27:21,746 --> 01:27:23,020
The Sound Factory ?
Perfect.

1132
01:27:23,106 --> 01:27:26,462
I know where it is. I'm going now.
Give me some backup.

1133
01:27:28,666 --> 01:27:30,145
Just maybe....

1134
01:27:30,746 --> 01:27:31,735
Maybe.

1135
01:29:04,066 --> 01:29:06,022
He's going to do Ted Bundy next.

1136
01:29:06,506 --> 01:29:08,576
That was the last name on the list.

1137
01:29:09,266 --> 01:29:11,826
He'll pick the
most extravagant murder.

1138
01:29:12,226 --> 01:29:14,376
The song talked about a threesome.

1139
01:29:14,946 --> 01:29:18,541
Bundy killed three girls in one night
at that sorority house...

1140
01:29:19,186 --> 01:29:20,585
Chi Omega.

1141
01:29:22,066 --> 01:29:23,738
He faked injuries.

1142
01:29:24,266 --> 01:29:27,463
He wore a cast on one arm,
and he used crutches...

1143
01:29:28,306 --> 01:29:30,456
and he asked the girls for help.

1144
01:29:33,026 --> 01:29:34,254
He drove...

1145
01:29:34,866 --> 01:29:37,255
a very distinctive car.
It was a...

1146
01:29:37,426 --> 01:29:38,825
Gold VW Bug.

1147
01:29:39,146 --> 01:29:40,977
We need to get on the DMV.

1148
01:29:41,146 --> 01:29:44,934
We want records on all gold
or tan-colored VW Bugs, any year.

1149
01:29:46,586 --> 01:29:49,896
<i>I want an in-person check
on every registered owner.</i>

1150
01:29:52,546 --> 01:29:56,539
Anyone who's registered a gold, yellow,
tan or any light-colored VW Bug.

1151
01:29:56,706 --> 01:30:00,062
Contact campus security
at every college within 50 miles.

1152
01:30:00,546 --> 01:30:04,619
<i>They need to warn all female students,
especially those with long hair...</i>

1153
01:30:04,706 --> 01:30:07,982
<i>to avoid any contact
with males they don't know.</i>

1154
01:30:11,466 --> 01:30:14,344
Report any man with an injury
or a handicap.

1155
01:30:19,346 --> 01:30:21,223
DMV printouts of all Bug owners.

1156
01:30:21,306 --> 01:30:22,625
Beautiful.

1157
01:30:38,906 --> 01:30:40,225
That's him.

1158
01:30:41,186 --> 01:30:44,861
He gave him the drink,
they went onto the dance floor and...

1159
01:30:45,026 --> 01:30:46,300
You're absolutely sure ?

1160
01:30:46,386 --> 01:30:47,614
Yeah, that's him.

1161
01:30:47,706 --> 01:30:49,617
Peter Foley, Daly City.

1162
01:31:14,946 --> 01:31:16,823
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

1163
01:31:22,146 --> 01:31:23,420
We've got him.

1164
01:31:24,786 --> 01:31:28,620
Call the SWAT team.
I'm not taking any chances with this fuck.

1165
01:31:36,586 --> 01:31:39,737
Kind of defeats the purpose
of my Miracle Bra but...

1166
01:31:40,146 --> 01:31:41,420
who's looking ?

1167
01:31:41,506 --> 01:31:43,098
You're onto him.

1168
01:31:43,266 --> 01:31:44,301
Good work.

1169
01:31:44,426 --> 01:31:46,098
Just horseshit luck.

1170
01:31:46,186 --> 01:31:47,539
I don't think so.

1171
01:31:50,626 --> 01:31:52,582
You take care out there.
Okay ?

1172
01:31:53,026 --> 01:31:54,539
Don't I always ?

1173
01:31:56,946 --> 01:31:58,299
I love you.

1174
01:31:59,306 --> 01:32:00,455
You know ?

1175
01:32:03,706 --> 01:32:04,821
I know.

1176
01:32:19,626 --> 01:32:21,856
You're looking good, Team leader.

1177
01:32:25,226 --> 01:32:27,057
This is a status "David".

1178
01:32:27,186 --> 01:32:28,414
Go, Team leader.

1179
01:32:28,506 --> 01:32:30,815
Peter Foley, this is the police.

1180
01:32:31,466 --> 01:32:33,138
Come to the front door.

1181
01:32:33,226 --> 01:32:35,979
Come out with your hands
above your head.

1182
01:32:39,346 --> 01:32:42,622
Team leader, we have a fire
in the basement window.

1183
01:32:43,306 --> 01:32:45,536
This is status "George".
This is go.

1184
01:33:47,266 --> 01:33:50,258
<i>Lieutenant, can you tell us
what happened here tonight ?</i>

1185
01:33:50,506 --> 01:33:54,738
<i>San Francisco Police developed evidence
that identified the killer...</i>

1186
01:33:55,266 --> 01:33:57,939
<i>known in the media
as "The Copycat Killer"...</i>

1187
01:33:58,186 --> 01:34:01,337
<i>as one Peter Foley,
who lived at this address.</i>

1188
01:34:02,786 --> 01:34:06,540
<i>When Mr. Foley was asked
to step outside to be interviewed...</i>

1189
01:34:06,626 --> 01:34:09,459
<i>it's believed that he set fire
to the residence.</i>

1190
01:34:17,466 --> 01:34:20,458
Don't tell me you both want
to use the men's room.

1191
01:34:38,466 --> 01:34:39,740
Hiya, Helen.

1192
01:34:43,026 --> 01:34:44,937
I got your invitation...

1193
01:34:45,186 --> 01:34:46,460
and I accept.

1194
01:34:46,546 --> 01:34:47,899
<i>Helen, it's MJ.</i>

1195
01:34:47,986 --> 01:34:50,705
<i>I'm sure you heard on your scanner
it was a mess.</i>

1196
01:34:51,226 --> 01:34:53,296
<i>I know it's late,
but I'm coming over.</i>

1197
01:34:53,386 --> 01:34:54,785
That's perfect.

1198
01:34:54,866 --> 01:34:56,777
That is perfect, Helen.

1199
01:34:57,506 --> 01:34:59,815
Sounds like we have company coming.

1200
01:35:00,386 --> 01:35:02,217
I'm not going to lie to you.

1201
01:35:05,346 --> 01:35:06,779
This is gonna hurt.

1202
01:35:46,906 --> 01:35:48,942
This is Inspector Monahan,
Homicide.

1203
01:35:49,026 --> 01:35:53,258
I'm at Pier One, Fort Mason. I've got
an officer down. I need assistance.

1204
01:35:53,346 --> 01:35:54,779
<i>Copy, Monahan.</i>

1205
01:37:23,626 --> 01:37:24,900
Up we go.

1206
01:37:28,146 --> 01:37:29,579
Oh, hi there.

1207
01:37:30,026 --> 01:37:32,620
We join our program
already in progress.

1208
01:37:34,146 --> 01:37:35,579
<i>Inspector Monahan...</i>

1209
01:37:36,306 --> 01:37:38,262
don't you ever get tired...

1210
01:37:38,346 --> 01:37:40,541
being a day late and $1 short ?

1211
01:37:42,426 --> 01:37:46,055
You probably think I'm going
to slit her throat right now.

1212
01:37:47,066 --> 01:37:49,102
Cut my losses, so to speak.

1213
01:37:51,986 --> 01:37:53,214
Wrong-o !

1214
01:37:53,986 --> 01:37:57,740
Do you really think I'd get her
all dressed up, so pretty...

1215
01:37:59,306 --> 01:38:00,944
with no place to go ?

1216
01:38:02,906 --> 01:38:04,624
If you're a smart cop...

1217
01:38:04,866 --> 01:38:06,743
you'll know where to find us.

1218
01:38:06,826 --> 01:38:09,294
And if you're a really smart cop...

1219
01:38:09,666 --> 01:38:11,258
you'll come alone.

1220
01:38:13,746 --> 01:38:15,099
Otherwise...

1221
01:38:16,066 --> 01:38:17,704
it's "bye-bye Helen. "

1222
01:38:19,306 --> 01:38:20,534
See you.

1223
01:39:14,586 --> 01:39:16,258
No, this is wrong.

1224
01:39:18,786 --> 01:39:20,458
Here we go, Helen.

1225
01:39:21,106 --> 01:39:22,505
There we go.

1226
01:39:22,666 --> 01:39:24,065
Much better.

1227
01:39:24,786 --> 01:39:26,060
What about him ?

1228
01:39:26,986 --> 01:39:28,624
Did I get the pose right ?

1229
01:39:28,866 --> 01:39:32,176
Did the best I could from the photos.
Come on, help me out.

1230
01:39:32,666 --> 01:39:35,499
Which way was his head ?
This way, or this way ?

1231
01:39:39,266 --> 01:39:40,335
This way.

1232
01:39:40,706 --> 01:39:42,219
Good. Excellent.

1233
01:39:42,306 --> 01:39:44,501
Everything has to be just so.

1234
01:39:47,906 --> 01:39:49,658
God, Helen, I remember...

1235
01:39:49,946 --> 01:39:52,380
watching you on the big screen.

1236
01:39:52,746 --> 01:39:54,259
In your red dress.

1237
01:39:54,346 --> 01:39:56,143
God, you looked huge.

1238
01:39:56,986 --> 01:39:58,305
Look at you now.

1239
01:39:58,466 --> 01:39:59,660
So sad.

1240
01:40:00,666 --> 01:40:02,736
But, look on the bright side.

1241
01:40:03,306 --> 01:40:06,264
I'm going to make you
the world's most famous victim.

1242
01:40:07,546 --> 01:40:09,423
Guess what that makes me ?

1243
01:40:10,626 --> 01:40:14,619
Did you know that more books have
been written about Jack the Ripper...

1244
01:40:15,306 --> 01:40:17,024
than Abraham Lincoln ?

1245
01:40:25,666 --> 01:40:27,418
It's a sick world...

1246
01:40:27,506 --> 01:40:28,939
isn't it, Helen ?

1247
01:40:34,666 --> 01:40:37,021
<i>You are not to go in there alone.</i>

1248
01:40:37,266 --> 01:40:39,018
<i>You wait for proper backup.</i>

1249
01:40:39,106 --> 01:40:41,176
<i>And you acknowledge my order !</i>

1250
01:40:41,266 --> 01:40:45,020
<i>You stay out of that building
until backup arrives ! You copy ?</i>

1251
01:40:45,106 --> 01:40:46,459
Absolutely, sir.

1252
01:41:21,026 --> 01:41:22,539
Careful, Helen.

1253
01:41:25,106 --> 01:41:26,061
See ?

1254
01:41:28,226 --> 01:41:30,501
Now you've cut yourself,
haven't you ?

1255
01:41:36,026 --> 01:41:38,062
See, I've been practicing.

1256
01:41:41,266 --> 01:41:43,018
Want to know the trick ?

1257
01:41:44,546 --> 01:41:45,774
Small...

1258
01:41:46,826 --> 01:41:48,305
incisions...

1259
01:41:50,546 --> 01:41:52,059
with a fine...

1260
01:41:52,706 --> 01:41:53,855
instrument.

1261
01:41:55,746 --> 01:41:57,099
That way...

1262
01:41:57,186 --> 01:41:58,824
I can make it last...

1263
01:41:58,946 --> 01:42:00,379
for hours.

1264
01:42:01,266 --> 01:42:04,383
You will not believe
how long a minute can feel.

1265
01:42:09,026 --> 01:42:10,300
Fuck you.

1266
01:42:11,906 --> 01:42:12,941
What ?

1267
01:42:13,026 --> 01:42:14,937
You heard me, you little twerp.

1268
01:42:15,386 --> 01:42:17,217
You think I'm afraid of you ?

1269
01:42:17,986 --> 01:42:19,419
I know you are.

1270
01:42:19,706 --> 01:42:21,503
I know all about you.

1271
01:42:22,466 --> 01:42:24,058
You're just a sad...

1272
01:42:24,226 --> 01:42:25,784
second-rate...

1273
01:42:25,986 --> 01:42:28,454
boring, impotent little copycat.

1274
01:42:32,026 --> 01:42:33,618
Watch it, bitch !

1275
01:42:33,826 --> 01:42:37,102
Or I will slice that smile off
your face, do you hear me ?

1276
01:42:37,346 --> 01:42:40,418
- Daryll Lee couldn't get it up, either.
- Do you hear me ?

1277
01:42:52,266 --> 01:42:54,222
I see, Helen. Nice try.

1278
01:42:55,306 --> 01:42:57,103
Want to know a secret ?

1279
01:42:57,666 --> 01:42:59,145
I'm onto your trick.

1280
01:42:59,906 --> 01:43:01,737
I won't kill you fast.

1281
01:43:02,466 --> 01:43:04,218
No matter how much...

1282
01:43:04,546 --> 01:43:06,298
you're gonna want me to.

1283
01:43:21,666 --> 01:43:22,940
Excellent.

1284
01:43:23,026 --> 01:43:25,256
Here's where Daryll Lee
got sloppy.

1285
01:43:29,426 --> 01:43:31,542
He wasn't expecting a second cop.

1286
01:43:31,626 --> 01:43:33,423
- But I am.
- I'm in here !

1287
01:43:33,826 --> 01:43:34,975
Helen, relax.

1288
01:43:35,346 --> 01:43:38,258
The other cop's collecting his pension.
So will she.

1289
01:43:39,226 --> 01:43:41,694
But if you warn her, I'll kill her.

1290
01:43:50,746 --> 01:43:53,897
This is Inspector Monahan.
I have a message for Quinn.

1291
01:43:54,106 --> 01:43:55,095
<i>Go ahead.</i>

1292
01:43:55,186 --> 01:43:56,460
Tell him...

1293
01:43:56,746 --> 01:43:58,338
I'm sorry, I blew it.

1294
01:45:18,026 --> 01:45:20,221
Now, that's my gun, isn't it ?

1295
01:45:20,706 --> 01:45:22,742
What in the world are you doing...

1296
01:45:23,746 --> 01:45:25,259
with my gun ?

1297
01:45:26,626 --> 01:45:28,264
Get your ass over here.

1298
01:45:28,706 --> 01:45:31,266
Come on, Doc,
help me out in this situation.

1299
01:45:31,626 --> 01:45:33,901
What do I do ?
Do I stick her or shoot her ?

1300
01:45:33,986 --> 01:45:35,704
Shoot her or stick her, huh ?

1301
01:45:35,786 --> 01:45:37,139
Come on, help me.

1302
01:46:16,306 --> 01:46:18,900
You watch this, Helen.
You watching ?

1303
01:46:20,026 --> 01:46:21,857
Perfect symmetry here.

1304
01:46:22,906 --> 01:46:24,976
Get up here. You watching ?

1305
01:46:26,306 --> 01:46:27,625
You watching this ?

1306
01:46:33,746 --> 01:46:35,862
Helen, what are you doing ?
No !

1307
01:46:38,426 --> 01:46:39,575
Feet on here !

1308
01:46:49,906 --> 01:46:50,861
Damn it !

1309
01:46:59,426 --> 01:47:02,577
Good try, Helen.
But you don't get off that easy.

1310
01:47:03,426 --> 01:47:05,337
Come on, get up. Let's go.

1311
01:47:05,506 --> 01:47:06,859
Get up, bitch.

1312
01:47:33,906 --> 01:47:35,021
Shit !

1313
01:47:49,746 --> 01:47:51,464
Help us ! Somebody !

1314
01:48:36,546 --> 01:48:37,581
Somebody !

1315
01:48:37,666 --> 01:48:38,781
Help us !

1316
01:48:47,506 --> 01:48:49,736
Looks like I cured the agoraphobia.

1317
01:48:50,706 --> 01:48:52,219
Help us ! Help !

1318
01:48:53,306 --> 01:48:54,022
Forget it !

1319
01:48:54,986 --> 01:48:56,260
Too late !

1320
01:48:56,626 --> 01:48:58,582
Too late for you, Helen !

1321
01:49:14,546 --> 01:49:16,218
Put up your dukes !

1322
01:49:17,986 --> 01:49:20,420
What the fuck are you
laughing at, bitch ?

1323
01:49:23,626 --> 01:49:25,423
What are you laughing at ?

1324
01:49:26,706 --> 01:49:28,378
What're you waiting for ?

1325
01:49:28,666 --> 01:49:29,815
Go ahead.

1326
01:51:08,906 --> 01:51:10,305
<i>Dear Conrad :</i>

1327
01:51:10,986 --> 01:51:12,783
<i>Thank you for your letter.</i>

1328
01:51:12,866 --> 01:51:14,015
<i>Praise the Lord.</i>

1329
01:51:14,106 --> 01:51:17,940
<i>I know you must be so happy
that He chose to spare Dr. Hudson.</i>

1330
01:51:19,306 --> 01:51:22,218
<i>The Big Guy moves in mysterious ways,
don't He ?</i>

1331
01:51:23,386 --> 01:51:25,980
<i>It just so happens
I'm awaiting the arrival...</i>

1332
01:51:26,066 --> 01:51:29,058
<i>of a pair of genuine
Helen Hudson undies...</i>

1333
01:51:30,346 --> 01:51:32,177
<i>signed personal to me.</i>

1334
01:51:33,066 --> 01:51:35,819
<i>A real collector's item,
I'm sure you'll know.</i>

1335
01:51:36,786 --> 01:51:38,105
<i>They're yours.</i>

1336
01:51:38,186 --> 01:51:41,178
<i>But don't forget,
a disciple must be strong...</i>

1337
01:51:41,386 --> 01:51:43,820
<i>if he is to succeed
where others fail.</i>

1338
01:51:44,826 --> 01:51:48,341
<i>Peter strayed from the path
and the Lord smote him good.</i>

1339
01:51:49,546 --> 01:51:50,899
<i>So keep it simple.</i>

1340
01:51:51,986 --> 01:51:53,499
<i>Then glory is yours...</i>

1341
01:51:53,626 --> 01:51:55,821
<i>and "vengeance is mine"...</i>

1342
01:51:56,386 --> 01:51:58,024
<i>as the Good Book says.</i>

1343
01:51:59,106 --> 01:52:00,983
<i>I know you'll get my meaning.</i>

1344
01:52:06,146 --> 01:52:07,864
<i>Happy hunting, partner.</i>

1345
01:52:09,066 --> 01:52:10,465
<i>Daryll Lee Cullum.</i>
