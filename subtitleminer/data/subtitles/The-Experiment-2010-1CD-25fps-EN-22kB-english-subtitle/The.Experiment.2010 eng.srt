1
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,600
- You suck, Gertrude.
- You suck.

2
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,200
Yeah, I suck so bad I just skunked you.

3
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,040
Which means, you gotta eat your pills.

4
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:49,320
- You're supposed to be nice to me.
- I am nice to you.

5
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,160
- It's not my fault you got no game.
- You suck, Travis.

6
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,160
I know.

7
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,520
Hey there, Travis.

8
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,520
- I'll check on you later.
- All right.

9
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,720
<i>Travis,</i>

10
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:09,480
you've been talking about seeing the world

11
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,800
the whole time you've been here.

12
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:17,200
Think of it as an opportunity to
finally fulfill that.

13
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,560
- Well, then you're firing me.
- Not firing, laying off.

14
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:24,680
And I'm not laying you off,
the state is laying you off.

15
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,360
All these budget cuts.

16
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,520
They're clear-cutting the part-time positions.

17
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,880
This has nothing to do with you.

18
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,000
My advice, Travis, go see the world.

19
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,720
Get that out of your system
like you've always wanted.

20
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,840
Maybe you come back,
they may be hiring again.

21
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,680
<i>- Home! Bring them home!
- Home! Bring them home!</i>

22
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,040
- Bring them home!
- Bring them home!

23
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,400
- Bring them home! Bring them home!
- Bring them home! Bring them home!

24
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,600
- Bring them home! Bring them home!
- Bring them home! Bring them home!

25
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:50,360
- I can't believe they fired me yesterday.
- Come on, man. It was a nursing home.

26
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,320
- It's a retirement home.
- Yeah, that's what I said. A nursing home.

27
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,720
It's better for the world than insurance.

28
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,720
- Hey, I'm carrying a sign, aren't I?
- Great.

29
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,840
Listen, not to get new-agey or nothing,

30
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,400
but I think this is something that
was supposed to happen to you, you know?

31
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,200
Force you out of your comfort zone,
make you mix it up a little bit.

32
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,960
- I don't need to mix it up, I need to get paid.
- Get innovative then, man.

33
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,520
Don't tell me you don't know how to do that.

34
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,120
Back in college when you were
doing all that test subject shit.

35
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,800
Selling your sperm.

36
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,200
I never sold my sperm.

37
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:20,960
'Cause nobody in their right mind
would pay for a piece of those genes.

38
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,560
You know what?

39
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:26,040
Whoever said peace rallies is
where the action is, doesn't know shit.

40
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:29,760
- This is a fucking dyke-fest.
- Not all of them.

41
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,760
No. Not happening.

42
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,640
What's happening?

43
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,080
- Hey. Hey!
- I got friends out there, you son of a bitch!

44
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,400
- Fucking liberal pussy!
- Enough.

45
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,440
- Get your fucking hands off me, man.
- Enough! Enough!

46
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,840
Guys like me go over there
and die for a living.

47
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,720
- Hey!
- Tee off, go ahead.

48
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,320
It's your issue, man. It's your issue, man.
Not mine.

49
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,080
Come on.

50
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,280
- Hypocrite!
- Let's go.

51
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,640
Fucking hypocrite! Go on!
Spread all your lies!

52
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,080
You got a captive audience,
you fucking hippie liberal!

53
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:14,200
Go on,
with all your propaganda and diatribes.

54
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,320
Thanks.

55
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:28,240
- You okay?
- Yeah, you?

56
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,200
I'm all right.

57
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:35,400
<i>My dad sat me down
and had me watch Red Dawn</i>

58
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,960
so that I would understand
just how bad things would get

59
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,920
if the Communists took over.

60
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,360
I sort of dug that flick.

61
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,520
Then it was narco-traffickers,
Islamo-Fascists.

62
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,040
Bad guys just keep changing their faces
and we keep going to war.

63
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,400
- And then...
- We keep protesting.

64
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:57,480
- United we stand.
- Cheers.

65
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,800
This is a big moment, Travis.

66
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:10,320
You've just witnessed
the last anti-war diatribe

67
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,480
- the world's ever gonna hear from me.
- Wow.

68
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,120
You know what I've realized?
Real war's in here.

69
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,120
You just figured that out?

70
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,720
No, I've known it for a while.

71
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:25,560
- But I'm finally gonna do something about it.
- And what's that?

72
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,560
I'm going to India.

73
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,600
I figure I'll do some yoga,

74
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,080
some time in an ashram,

75
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,960
have sex with my guru.

76
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,560
We'll both agree afterwards that
it was a mistake, of course.

77
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,120
Of course.

78
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,280
Maybe you should go. We could meet up.

79
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:57,080
Well, a trip like that
would be a pretty penny,

80
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,520
- which I don't got.
- Could knock over a liquor store.

81
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,400
I think I could come up with something
slightly more legit.

82
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,600
Such as?

83
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,560
You don't wanna know.

84
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,440
I think I can handle it.

85
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:15,000
I mean, I think I'm intellectually
limber enough.

86
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,680
Can I see you again?

87
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:59,200
- Michael Barris.
- Travis, hey.

88
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,120
- Smart man.
- What?

89
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:08,560
- You wore a suit. That's a smart move.
- Yeah.

90
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:12,120
- I heard there's not many spots.
- Do I need to sign here or print my name?

91
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,960
- Just a signature will do.
- Thanks, boo. Love the jacket.

92
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,120
We are strangers in a strange land, brother.

93
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,960
First off, what we will be doing here,
for those of you that don't know,

94
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:29,040
will be a behavioral experiment,
in which we will be simulating

95
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,120
the conditions of life
inside a state penitentiary.

96
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:35,320
Now, our only requirement is that
none of you have ever served any time.

97
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,680
If you have, we'd like to
thank you for your interest,

98
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,360
but you do not fit our profile.

99
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,520
Now, we will be conducting
a short series of tests in a moment,

100
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,560
but before we do
I would just like to take a beat

101
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,920
and let you know that
although the actual experiment

102
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,600
will be conducted
in an utterly secure environment

103
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:53,520
and the participants will be safe at all times,

104
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,760
some of the subjects
will be deprived of their civil rights...

105
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,000
- It's a flying man.
...for the entire two weeks.

106
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,240
What's his name?

107
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:05,280
- Flying Man.
- Now, let's get to the tests, shall we?

108
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,240
- No history of incarceration?
- No.

109
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,640
- Violence?
- No.

110
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,320
- Never?
- No.

111
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:20,280
- What about religion?
- No.

112
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:25,080
No? Religion's not usually
a yes or no question, Mr. Hunt.

113
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:29,040
People tend to find all sorts of gray areas
in which to couch their answers.

114
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,200
Well, nothing gray here.

115
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:34,280
So, how do you base
your ethical decisions, then?

116
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,160
Here.

117
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,680
I was in Boy Scouts,
and drill team in high school,

118
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,240
various church groups.

119
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,000
- You were devout, then?
- Still am.

120
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:53,120
And what about
absolute right and wrong in the universe?

121
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,000
Well, I guess,

122
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:05,560
if I believe in God,
then I would have to, right?

123
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,040
Yeah, you know, I only got three rules,

124
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:13,480
eat twat, smoke pot, and smile a lot.

125
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,880
It's just a short slide-show
we'd like you to watch.

126
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,160
It's perfectly safe, I assure you.

127
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:38,440
<i>The sheriff's deputies had escorted
Duceppe back to Baton Rouge.</i>

128
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:41,520
<i>I am convinced that
when these animals are herded together</i>

129
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,160
<i>their instincts warn them of...</i>

130
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,040
<i>... California hotel, where FBI agents...</i>

131
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:34,440
- Are you okay to move on, Mr. Hunt?
- Yep. I'm good.

132
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,720
You wouldn't have hit him.

133
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,800
Who?

134
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,800
The guy at the rally.

135
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,760
You wouldn't have hit him.

136
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:15,240
These knuckles, they're pristine.

137
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,080
- You calling me a pussy?
- Yeah.

138
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:27,000
- It's a compliment.
- Cool.

139
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:33,040
I'll be gone by the time
you get out, you know.

140
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,240
I know.

141
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:50,120
Dashashwamedh Ghat, Varanasi.

142
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:55,400
- Varanasi.
- How soon can you be there?

143
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:00,440
Twelfth? Thirteenth?

144
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,400
Thirteenth.

145
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:07,280
Dashashwamedh Ghat on the 13th, 6:00 p.m.

146
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:15,480
- Hey, you made it.
- Good to see you.

147
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,680
- Yeah.
- I was hoping I'd have someone to talk to.

148
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:22,960
I can't help but think that
this says something about us.

149
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,520
I think it says we need money.

150
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:32,840
- Sorry.
- Hey, how's it going?

151
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:48,600
- It's the beginning.
- Game on.

152
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:52,880
So let's move on to the topic of women.
What's that word mean to you?

153
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,360
Women? What?

154
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,560
Everything on God's green earth

155
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:11,040
and possibly beyond what's been
discovered in our universe yet?

156
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,080
I don't know.

157
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,800
<i>Look, it's only a dog.
So, what're you worried about?</i>

158
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,720
<i>Worried? Who's worried?
I'm only worried about you.</i>

159
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,680
<i>Look, I'll stay here and protect the car,
and you go take a look.</i>

160
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,280
Hey, chickenshit, we got a draft!

161
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,840
Didn't you hear me, chickenshit?

162
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:53,000
We got a draft. Close the window!

163
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,440
I fell asleep. How far did we drive?

164
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,520
This is a fucking spot.

165
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,760
Gentlemen, they're waiting inside.

166
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:54,360
You mind if I just grab my bag?
There's some stuff in there that I need.

167
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:57,400
You'll have everything you need inside.

168
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,560
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

169
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:16,520
The next two weeks
will be a new experience for you.

170
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:20,440
Now as I said before,
some of you will have no civil rights.

171
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:23,000
Do not underestimate that.

172
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,600
If any of you wanna leave,
now is your last chance.

173
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,320
No?

174
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,000
Good.

175
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:37,200
Again, your safety is
our number one priority.

176
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:40,240
If there is any violence, any at all,

177
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:43,480
the experiment
will be immediately terminated.

178
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,000
Clear?

179
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,920
Now, when I call your name, please stand.

180
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:50,680
Dernier, Bosch,

181
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:54,840
Helweg, Sandberg,

182
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:59,600
Chase, and Barris.

183
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,400
Good.

184
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:07,400
So the rest of you,
please stand up and follow the yellow line.

185
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:12,360
- Later, pal.
- Good luck, gentlemen. And I thank you.

186
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:20,720
So what do you think, Girl Scouts?
Prisoners or guards?

187
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,600
I think we just got our answer.

188
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,840
Nothing is to come or go from the cell block.

189
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,920
Nothing from the outside world.

190
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:37,200
If you look in your lockers,
you will see a printout with the five rules

191
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,480
that the prisoners are to follow at all times.

192
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,240
Please read them aloud with me.

193
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,920
"Rule number one:

194
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,360
"Prisoners must eat three meals a day
and all food must be consumed.

195
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,320
"Two: There will be 30 minutes of rec daily.

196
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:55,280
"Three: Prisoners are allowed only
in prisoner-designated areas.

197
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:59,200
"Four: Prisoners must speak
only when spoken to.

198
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:04,760
"And five: Prisoners must not touch
the guards under any circumstances."

199
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:09,240
Those that break the rules
must be punished commensurately.

200
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,440
What does "commensurate" mean?

201
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:15,040
This experiment is not about individuals.

202
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,760
If any one person leaves, it's over.

203
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,720
If a prisoner does break the rules,

204
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:23,200
you will have 30 minutes to choose
proper disciplinary action.

205
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,160
If you fail to do so,
that red light will come on,

206
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,880
the experiment will be terminated,
and you will not get paid.

207
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,480
- What did you say?
- You either maintain strict order,

208
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,600
or you don't get paid.

209
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,320
I will see you in two weeks.

210
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:00,200
- Sorry, man.
- For what?

211
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,800
- All this.
- Don't sweat it.

212
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:07,480
All right, turn around. Gotta do the front.

213
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,720
What? Nobody else had to turn around.

214
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,640
What's the problem, Boy George,

215
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:14,120
you afraid we gonna see that
you got no dick?

216
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,960
- Fuck you.
- Hey, man. Quit being a fag, huh?

217
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,840
Maybe if we drop the soap...

218
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,680
All right, girls. Everyone on the line!

219
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:28,240
- Which one?
- I don't know.

220
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,960
That one. That line.

221
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,800
- How you doing?
- Gotta be honest,

222
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:39,400
you guys are the most suck-ass guards
I've ever seen.

223
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:46,080
Yeah, well, you can blow me
and the entire state of Kentucky.

224
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,040
Kentucky?

225
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,840
All right, look, we gotta stop fucking around

226
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,320
or they might end this thing
before it even begins.

227
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,360
I didn't come all the way out here
not to get paid.

228
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:02,560
"From now on inmates will be addressed
only by their inmate numbers."

229
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,440
That's awesome.

230
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:07,920
Wow.

231
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,960
The only other thing
that you girls need to know

232
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:17,000
is, "Prisoners will find cell assignments
attached to each cell."

233
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:21,240
- Are we supposed to do that?
- Yes, Tinker Bell.

234
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,360
- Now?
- Yes.

235
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:25,280
Now run along. Run along, find your homes.

236
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,000
- Okay.
- Going.

237
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:30,000
- Okay, guys...
- This ain't a love-in. Get moving.

238
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,760
Waiting for a bus? Come on!

239
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:40,040
Hey, Travis.

240
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,840
Seventeen.

241
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,200
Seventy-seven.

242
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:58,480
Wow, I feel dangerous
just wearing this outfit.

243
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,760
- You look dangerous.
- Oh, yeah.

244
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,640
Yeah, you are massively
messing with me, right?

245
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,080
- No.
- No?

246
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:08,320
- Benjy Putterman.
- How you doing? Travis.

247
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,600
Novelist.

248
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:17,280
- Novelist, huh?
- Graphic novelist, actually.

249
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,520
- Comics.
- Graphic novels.

250
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:26,640
Oh, my God, I'm gonna get so much material
from this place.

251
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,880
- This is ripping!
- Yeah.

252
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,040
Ripping.

253
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,080
So, what drew you to this experiment?

254
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,640
Cash-dollars.

255
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,360
My mother.

256
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,760
It was her idea?

257
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,920
She broke her hip,

258
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,840
I needed to pay the rent.

259
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,360
Do you live with your mother?

260
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,720
Yes.

261
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,440
And how old are you?

262
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,640
Forty-two.

263
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:02,840
So, what drew you
to this experiment, Mr. Chase?

264
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,760
Pussy. Pussy drew me to the experiment.

265
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,840
It's a male-only experiment, Mr. Chase.

266
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:12,160
It's the pussy I'm gonna get
with the 14 grand once I'm done.

267
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,040
How many sexual partners have you had?

268
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:19,040
I lost track when I was, like, 17.

269
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,760
Were they male or female?

270
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,640
Female.

271
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:27,120
So, what drew you to
this experiment, Mr. Nix?

272
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,840
I'm just trying to make an honest buck, man.

273
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:31,800
Escape.

274
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,480
Come on, you big boy.

275
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,400
Throw it down.

276
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,560
Seventy-seven.

277
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,480
- Flying Man?
- No.

278
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,560
You guys go ahead.

279
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,880
Oh, hell no. These knees are busted.

280
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,800
Hey, how about it, redwood? Throw it down?

281
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,960
- Wait.
- Oh, my God. Is he okay?

282
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,640
- I'm sorry.
- Fuck.

283
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,760
- Bosch, you all right?
- I'm all right.

284
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:07,200
- Let's get you out of here.
- I thought he was looking.

285
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,320
- Come on.
- I did.

286
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,880
- You all right, big man. You all right.
- It's all right. It was an accident.

287
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,800
It's all right.

288
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,480
What the fuck was that guy thinking, huh?

289
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:25,360
I'm okay. I'm okay. He didn't mean it.

290
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:28,000
- Sure you're all right?
- It's just a bloody nose.

291
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:31,360
Let's just go back to work. Please.

292
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,160
I don't know.

293
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:38,600
- I think we gotta do something.
- What are you talking about?

294
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:41,400
I'm talking about rule number five.

295
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,240
Prisoners are not supposed to touch us.

296
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,280
Well, technically, he didn't touch us.
The ball did.

297
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,280
Look at your face, man.

298
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:56,000
I mean, we all heard what they said.
We gotta keep the order.

299
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,960
Respond commensurately.

300
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:03,720
They saw it. They know it was an accident.

301
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:07,800
- I agree.
- Are you sure about that?

302
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:11,080
Look, I just don't want that light
to come on in 30 minutes

303
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,000
because we didn't do what
we were supposed to do.

304
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,520
- I got 14 grand on the line.
- Yeah, we all got 14 grand on the line.

305
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,240
Come on.

306
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,800
We're not talking about
crucifying the man here.

307
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,680
The word's commensurate.

308
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,360
Which means,

309
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:31,720
if what the man did was small potatoes,

310
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,280
we respond in kind.

311
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:38,080
Small potatoes for small potatoes.

312
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,080
Either that,

313
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:44,080
or we wait till that light goes on.

314
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,520
Push-ups, ten.

315
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,320
Do them now.

316
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:00,680
I just need a little civility, that's all.

317
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,240
It was an accident.

318
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:13,760
This is not a fucking negotiation.
Do the push-ups.

319
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,480
Just a little civility, brother. Just a little.

320
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:26,000
All right, everyone, ten push-ups.

321
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:35,000
You heard the man. Let's go.

322
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,720
Do it! Come on, do it!

323
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,560
Yeah, follow your little brother.

324
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,080
There we are.

325
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:45,920
Count them out.

326
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,120
- One, two, three...
- One, two, three...

327
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,040
...four, five, six...
...four, five, six...

328
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:55,640
...seven, eight, nine, ten.
...seven, eight, nine, ten.

329
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:59,960
What did that tell you, huh?
Tater Tots for Tater Tots.

330
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,880
And you, you ought to be a cop, dude.

331
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:06,000
- Looked more like a drill sergeant to me.
- Yeah.

332
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:08,400
<i>Like that guy out of Full Metal Jacket.</i>

333
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:11,320
- "Give me 20, maggot!"
- Fuck you.

334
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,840
I'm almost embarrassed for them,
to be honest.

335
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:16,360
You know, stepping and fetching like that.

336
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,000
Has it been 30 minutes yet?

337
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,000
Just.

338
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,440
I guess we got our verdict.

339
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,640
I'm not mad, you know?

340
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,560
At them.

341
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:42,360
They keep making us do push-ups like this,
we'll be all swoll.

342
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,320
All of us are.

343
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,280
You know, get paid and get in shape.

344
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,320
- You got a girl, 17?
- No.

345
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,400
What about you?

346
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,520
- I'm at the start of something.
- Yeah?

347
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,080
Me too. Feels good, doesn't it?

348
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:02,520
- Good and bad.
- Mine's a barista.

349
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:06,000
Wouldn't think a guy like me
could pull a barista, would you?

350
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,800
What exactly do you write, anyway?

351
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,320
- Comics.
- Graphic novels.

352
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,000
<i>Yeah, Flying Man's my next big launch.</i>

353
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,200
<i>- Flying Man?
- Yep.</i>

354
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:18,520
The man who flies.

355
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,320
- What's he do besides fly?
- See that?

356
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:25,560
What you just said,
"What else he do besides fly?"

357
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:29,120
That's how jaded people have become.
We're talking about flying here.

358
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,400
Like a human being, actually flying.

359
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:36,000
And no cape, nothing.
Just flying, you know?

360
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:38,200
Like you or me in this cell
just kind of taking off

361
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:40,880
like nothing could limit us.
Like we could just go, go, go.

362
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,320
Tell me, honestly,
who is not gonna want to read that?

363
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:46,840
I shouldn't be talking about this anyway.
My agent would kill me if he knew I was.

364
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:49,000
- You got an agent, huh?
- Yeah, couple.

365
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:51,240
How you like that, 77?

366
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:54,520
Looks like we got a heavy hitter
in the box with us.

367
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,240
Yeah, we do.

368
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:01,280
9:00, ladies! Lights out!

369
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:42,160
- Really, come on.
- What?

370
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:46,560
- What is it?
- Move along, fuck-butt.

371
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:52,000
Yum, yum, come on, people. Move along!

372
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:33,200
Hey, hey, hey. You gotta clean your plate.

373
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,080
Come on, man. That's not gonna happen.

374
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,760
What are you?
Spokesman for the union now?

375
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,400
Look, nobody's trying to be difficult.

376
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:44,760
We'll eat everything else, just not that.

377
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:48,040
I mean, look at it.
It literally might be dog shit.

378
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:57,960
It's beans. Come on, eat them.

379
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,560
Come on, guys.

380
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,840
It's not like I'm being
unreasonable here, right?

381
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,360
I mean, we got rules, okay?

382
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,600
Rule number one:
You gotta clean your plate.

383
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:11,200
Rule number six says,
"You gotta eat dog shit."

384
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:13,440
It's not dog shit.

385
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,480
It's dog shit.

386
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:21,880
Well, that's too bad.
'Cause you gotta eat it anyway.

387
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:24,480
Okay, I'm gonna just...
Oh, my God. My dog shit!

388
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:27,560
You fucking shit. Out of there.

389
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:30,960
Look, okay, memo to Adolf,
uniform's not real. Okay, baby?

390
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,280
<i>Hey, Moulin Rouge, you gotta eat it.</i>

391
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:36,600
Nobody's leaving here
until their plates are clean.

392
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,440
You heard the man, huh?

393
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,240
The word is clean.

394
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:50,200
- Clean? Is that the word?
- Yeah.

395
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,160
Now it's clean.

396
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:02,280
He just earned you guys
some more push-ups.

397
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:06,120
Push-ups. You heard the man! Push-ups!

398
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,480
I'll give you push-ups. Push this up!

399
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:18,040
Complete wrong move, ass-licker.

400
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,480
Step back!

401
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:32,560
- You shouldn't have done that!
- Keep it up, girls. Get it out of your system.

402
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:35,280
That's right, you goose-stepping pussy!

403
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:37,960
I will see you girls tonight.

404
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:40,840
Feel the wrath of Flying Man!

405
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:42,840
Flying Man?

406
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:48,800
Yeah.

407
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:53,400
This is our house, bitches!
This is our house!

408
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:57,560
Only reason,
only fucking reason they did that

409
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:01,200
was 'cause they knew
they weren't gonna get their asses kicked.

410
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:05,240
You take away someone's fear
of getting punched in the fucking mouth,

411
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:08,280
all of a sudden,
they're the biggest cocksuckers

412
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:10,160
on the fucking planet.

413
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,880
That may be true, but the rules are the rules.

414
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,280
We don't use violence.

415
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,040
Well, we obviously gotta do something.

416
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:25,520
I mean, we are being tested
just as much as they are.

417
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,600
They made me look like a fucking pussy
is what they did.

418
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,040
Yeah.

419
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,160
I got an idea.

420
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:36,960
I pledged for a fraternity once.

421
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,880
And during Hell Week, the brothers,

422
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:42,360
they would break down our will.

423
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:45,960
They would try to humble us
for the initiation that was gonna come.

424
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:50,040
I mean, the rules,
they were pretty much the same as here.

425
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:52,680
I mean, they couldn't hurt us.

426
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,800
But they could do something much worse,

427
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,120
they could humiliate us.

428
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:04,400
That's what we have to do.

429
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:10,840
Is we have to humiliate them.

430
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,080
What? What are you doing?

431
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:48,440
- What the hell is the matter with you?
- That is for inciting them.

432
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,680
- What? What are you talking about?
- Shut up.

433
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,680
You need to shut up. All right?

434
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:07,160
There will be no more incidents

435
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,880
like there was today.

436
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,600
Is that understood?

437
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:17,640
I said, is that understood?

438
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,760
- Yes.
- Yes.

439
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,720
Yes, what? 'Cause I can't hear you.

440
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:25,240
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

441
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:36,080
Who's the bitches now, bitches?

442
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:42,280
Great job, guys. Great job.

443
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,480
- Dude, I...
- Great job.

444
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:50,480
- Nice speech.
- Good job, good job.

445
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,160
I'll catch up later.

446
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:05,000
Excuse me? Excuse me?

447
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:11,840
I'm having heat flashes.
I think my blood sugar is low.

448
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:17,760
Capote, just shut the fuck up, okay?

449
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:25,600
- What are you talking about, man?
- I'm having low blood sugar.

450
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:30,000
If I gotta say "Shut the fuck up"
one more time...

451
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,360
You all right?

452
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:59,320
Okay, everybody's had their fun.

453
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:07,440
I'm gonna suggest

454
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:10,800
that we act like gentlemen
for the rest of the way.

455
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,760
That we play by the rules

456
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,080
these last 11 days.

457
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,160
And everybody can go home happily
with their money.

458
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,600
How's that sound?

459
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,320
Where is 51?

460
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,680
Where's 51?

461
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:47,560
Let's go.

462
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,800
I need sugar.

463
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:59,840
Look, diabetic.
Says he's diabetic on his application.

464
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:02,200
So he needs insulin, that's what it is.

465
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:05,280
No, no, no. Look.
It says he regulates it through diet.

466
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,720
Yeah, man, it's in his own words.

467
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,120
He's the one that filled this out.

468
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:16,360
This is not a big deal. It's not.

469
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:18,560
I mean, my fucking grandma
has basically the same thing,

470
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,560
and she just gets moody in between meals.

471
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:23,560
Trust me, this is not a big deal.

472
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:27,200
Fifty-one, you need to get up.

473
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,280
Let's go, come on. Get up.

474
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,840
Hey, I wanna do this.

475
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,200
I do. I just need a Twix bar.

476
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:36,040
There's one in my bag if you can find it.

477
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:38,760
Twix bar. Is that what you wanna eat?

478
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,800
Get him up. Get him up. Come on. Come on!

479
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:46,840
- Are you kidding me?
- You're all right.

480
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:52,720
- Hey, why don't you let the man be?
- You know the rules, 77.

481
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:55,480
All prisoners must participate in rec.

482
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:59,640
And you do not address me
unless I have spoken to you first.

483
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,120
The man... Look at him.

484
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:04,040
The man can't do it.

485
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:15,520
You do understand that
this is a prison experiment, right?

486
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,160
Yes.

487
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:21,840
And you do understand
the roles that we've been given?

488
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:25,120
- Obviously.
- You are a prisoner.

489
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:31,400
You don't give orders, we give orders.

490
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:35,320
Have I made myself completely clear
to you now?

491
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:42,400
Let the man lie down.

492
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:51,760
Do I need to escalate matters right now?

493
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:55,000
Is that what I should do?

494
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,440
What is that supposed to mean?

495
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:02,600
It means that you won't shut up.

496
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:09,040
And I am trying to figure out
how I'm supposed to deal with that.

497
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:15,640
- Why don't you try being rational?
- How is this for rational?

498
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:17,040
Do I look rational now? Do I?

499
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:18,640
- Let's put the sugar in him real quick, man.
- Put it away.

500
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:19,720
Do I look rational now?

501
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:23,600
You hit me and the experiment is over.

502
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:27,240
You know that and I know that.

503
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,920
Easy now, brother. Come on.

504
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,680
Okay. It's okay.

505
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:35,360
All right, everyone, back in their cell.

506
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,880
Let's go, guards!
Get them back in their cells!

507
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,640
- Let's go.
- Get in!

508
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,360
I don't need an escort.

509
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:46,400
This ain't right! I ain't playing that shit.

510
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,720
Go. Move!

511
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:23,520
<i>What do you think they want from us?</i>

512
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:28,040
Why would you run a prison experiment?

513
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:32,720
Throw some animals in a cage

514
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:37,080
and you get to find out which one
of us is gonna be the lions

515
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:40,000
and which ones are gonna get gut.

516
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:46,320
I like to think we're slightly higher
on the evolutionary chain than monkeys.

517
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:49,880
It don't matter how evolved you think we are.

518
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:54,400
You lock up any animal long enough
and the strong's gonna eat the weak.

519
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,280
That's just the way it is.

520
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:02,280
You learn that in prison, 17?

521
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:08,840
- You must think I'm somebody else, slick.
- No.

522
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:12,000
Just that tattoo you got there is an Aryan tat,

523
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:15,440
so I figured, you know,
you probably got that in the pen.

524
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:23,560
Expert in the penitentiary system,
are you, boy?

525
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:27,040
I just watch a lot of Discovery Channel.

526
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:31,200
You will not interfere
with my ability to make a paycheck.

527
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:35,520
You understand?

528
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:41,000
We're cool. No sweat.

529
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:49,800
So, what were you in for anyway?

530
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:58,520
- Did you really just ask me that?
- Yeah. I just asked you that.

531
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,160
- You better pump your brakes, boy.
- Oh, yeah?

532
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:07,280
- Why's that?
- Lf you don't start respecting the guards,

533
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:10,240
you're gonna have a serious problem.

534
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:15,160
- They're not guards.
- No, they're guards all right.

535
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:18,920
And them up there,
they're getting exactly what they want.

536
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:25,360
I suggest you stop protecting your friend.

537
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:27,640
What's right is right, man.

538
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:30,600
Last thing a man wants to be in the pen
is right.

539
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:31,920
Dudes, they...

540
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:35,760
They start digging in
and getting all righteous then.

541
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:40,920
That only leads to one place.
Go along to get along, man.

542
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:46,000
Whatever fire you got in your belly,
you're best to let it go.

543
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:48,680
Trust me.

544
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:51,640
Let it go.

545
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:53,240
<i>All I know</i>

546
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:59,240
is homie lost his shit back there.

547
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:03,040
- It was just a show.
- For you, maybe.

548
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:08,280
- Half those fuckers, they were ready to go.
- They weren't gonna do anything.

549
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:09,880
How well do you know them?

550
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:11,960
The assholes outnumber us, for one.

551
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
If they wanted to take the advantage,
they could.

552
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:16,720
Us out here in the middle
of fucking nowhere, we're on our own.

553
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:19,160
The experimenters,
they wouldn't let anything happen.

554
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,160
How well do you know them?

555
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:28,760
Seventy-seven, he's the ringleader.

556
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:34,560
Either way, if it keeps going like this,
someone's gonna throw down.

557
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:38,760
Look, guys, guys.
If anyone gets hurt, this experiment is over.

558
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:39,880
None of us will get paid.

559
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:42,320
Well, we gotta put the clamps on this thing
once and for all then.

560
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:44,720
What're you thinking?

561
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:49,040
You wanna know how to reach these guys?

562
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:51,240
How?

563
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:55,720
You scare 'em.

564
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:39,120
Comfortable?

565
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:46,840
Helweg?

566
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:51,920
Come on...

567
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:03,200
The prisoners, they listen to you.

568
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:09,640
For some reason they look to you
like you're the leader.

569
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:13,960
I got news for you.

570
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:15,600
In here,

571
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:19,080
you're the leader of shit.

572
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:24,000
This place, it belongs to us.

573
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:26,000
It belongs to us.

574
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:31,840
Hey, there are all kinds of things
that we could do to you

575
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:37,040
to make you hip to that fact.

576
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:53,600
So, do we have the proper respect

577
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:55,560
for authority now?

578
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:59,920
Fuck you, you sick fuck.

579
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:34,800
This stuff is going right through me.

580
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:41,720
- Saddle up, gentlemen!
- Fuck!

581
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:43,600
You want to send a message?

582
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:46,640
Then send a message. Saddle up.

583
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:50,920
Saddle up!

584
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:55,520
What the hell...

585
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:35,480
You okay?

586
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:26,720
That was colossally fucked up.

587
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:29,560
I mean, you are shit-ass nuts,
you know that?

588
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:33,640
And that's a good thing, Barris.

589
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:40,600
The light, it didn't come on.
They saw it, and it's not coming on.

590
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:48,120
We did what we did, we sent a message,
but it never leaves this place.

591
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:49,840
I got something to say.

592
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:55,400
If anything happens like that again,
anything at all,

593
00:49:57,560 --> 00:49:58,640
I'm out of here.

594
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:03,600
You make a unilateral decision like that,

595
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:09,400
it could cost the rest of us 100 grand.

596
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:14,360
I don't care, sir.

597
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:32,680
Let it go.

598
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:49,560
Scenario.

599
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:53,800
Someone harms someone you love.
Rapes them, kills them.

600
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:55,160
The law fails to prosecute.

601
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:59,640
This person is free.
There is absolutely nothing you can do.

602
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:03,360
- Would you consider that justice?
- I don't think on those terms.

603
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:07,600
Justice is what keeps us safe
as a society. Ordered.

604
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:13,080
Well, justice is... Well, it starts wars.
An eye for an eye for an eye.

605
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:18,200
It takes a turning of the cheek
for this species to evolve.

606
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:20,920
So, you're the one who knows
what it's going to take

607
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:22,840
for the human species to evolve.

608
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,720
Just regurgitating what people
a lot smarter than me have been saying

609
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:28,400
for a long, long time.

610
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:03,120
Hey.

611
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:11,240
Look what I found. Take it.
That ought to boost your blood sugar.

612
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:14,240
No, it won't.

613
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:16,320
Yeah, there's a lot of carbohydrates in there.

614
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:21,200
It's like the world's cheapest bread.
It's going to turn to sugar. Trust me.

615
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:23,800
Yeah, it won't turn to insulin, though.

616
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:27,920
I thought you didn't need insulin.

617
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:29,400
Fibbed.

618
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:38,200
If they wouldn't let me bring it down here,
I figured I could tough it out.

619
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,280
Jesus Christ.

620
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:43,960
- Benjy...
- Fifty-one.

621
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,360
Listen, you can't play around with this.
I got to let them know immediately.

622
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:48,880
I mean, they need to know.
I got to get you out of here.

623
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:49,920
No.

624
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:52,560
You don't understand. You could die.

625
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:56,080
Not if I get the insulin.

626
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:01,440
Why are you doing this?

627
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:09,080
Flying Man is a fraud.

628
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:11,600
Don't say that.

629
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:17,720
Yeah. It's stupid. It's a stupid, shitty, fat lie.
Just like me.

630
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:19,920
He's just a man that flies.

631
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:30,040
I need this. I need to stop being a fraud.

632
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:35,720
I need for once to have something
to show for myself.

633
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:42,800
Please, 77. Please.

634
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:20,600
- What the fuck you doing?
- Jesus!

635
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:22,640
Nothing.

636
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:26,960
- Don't beat your shit off next to me.
- I'm not beating my shit. Fuck off.

637
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:05,800
I'll give you a thousand of my own money.

638
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:09,280
He should just go.

639
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:15,680
Listen, man, there's insulin in his bag.
Can you get it?

640
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:22,040
You know that's not allowed.

641
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:25,840
I'll give you two. Two thousand.

642
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:33,560
Two thousand, man. He needs it.

643
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:45,080
I don't need the money.

644
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:19,520
Twenty-two. Get up.

645
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:22,840
Captain wants to see you.

646
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:48,840
Lucky for us, there's no cameras in here.

647
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:52,120
What?

648
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:56,080
All right, so if we're going to do this,
you can't tell anybody.

649
00:56:57,920 --> 00:56:59,320
The fuck are you talking about?

650
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:03,640
All I want is a blow job. That's it.

651
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:05,960
No, no, no, no.

652
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,800
Come on. Just get down on your knees.

653
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:11,000
Yeah. I'm going to go back to my cell...

654
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:14,560
First, you get down on your knees, all right?
All right?

655
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:15,880
I want to go back to my cell.

656
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:18,480
You will soon enough.
But first you're going to suck my dick.

657
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:20,080
Suck it yourself.

658
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:23,680
Get down on your knees.
Get down on your fucking knees.

659
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:28,040
What's going on in here?

660
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:29,120
Nothing.

661
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:31,280
What is that prisoner doing out of his cell?

662
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:35,040
He had something to tell me
about number 77.

663
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:37,880
He didn't want to say it in front of the others.

664
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:39,600
- Seventy-seven?
- Yeah.

665
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:41,440
- Is that true?
- Yeah, that's true.

666
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:43,560
No, I'm asking him. Is that true?

667
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:45,360
It's true. It's true.

668
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:48,720
Barris. Thank God I found you.
You got to come quick.

669
00:57:57,320 --> 00:57:58,280
See?

670
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:05,680
Why?

671
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:18,280
What were you doing back there?

672
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:21,240
Nothing.

673
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:24,240
I need you to empty your pockets
for me then.

674
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:30,320
Empty your pockets, Bosch.
Empty that pocket right there.

675
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:52,600
You know that nothing from the outside
world enters into this cell block.

676
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:55,360
- You know that, right?
- I mean, I was...

677
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:57,520
Quiet. Shut up.

678
00:59:01,640 --> 00:59:04,680
They're trying to get you to undermine me.
I know you would never do that.

679
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:08,440
Who asked you to do that?

680
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:11,440
You tell me and all will be forgiven.

681
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:15,160
Who told you?

682
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:51,880
We need to talk later about this.

683
00:59:56,520 --> 00:59:57,560
Later.

684
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:22,080
As you can see,

685
01:00:24,280 --> 01:00:25,800
I'm a reasonable man.

686
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:30,160
I'm not the monster that you
somehow conjured up in your head.

687
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:37,480
I've been given a position,

688
01:00:39,120 --> 01:00:40,720
didn't ask for it.

689
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:47,520
In some ways it would've been easier
if I was just a prisoner.

690
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:51,160
- Like you.
- I doubt that very much.

691
01:00:51,640 --> 01:00:53,280
You broke the rules again, 77.

692
01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:54,920
The guy could've died
if he didn't get his insulin...

693
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:56,400
"The guy could've died
if he didn't get his insulin."

694
01:00:56,440 --> 01:00:57,760
"Guy could've died
if he didn't get his insulin."

695
01:00:57,960 --> 01:00:58,960
Did you hear that?

696
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
A guy could've died
if he didn't get his insulin!

697
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:03,760
Really?

698
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:06,680
When you speak, can you hear yourself?

699
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:14,640
What do you think is on
the other side of those cameras?

700
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:19,200
We are being watched

701
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:24,520
24 hours a day by people
who know what they are doing.

702
01:01:25,360 --> 01:01:30,040
Do you think that if there was even a chance,
just the littlest bit of a chance,

703
01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:33,400
that somebody'd die,
that they would let it happen?

704
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:36,800
He's perfectly safe, your friend.

705
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:43,400
They will keep him perfectly safe.

706
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:48,880
When this is over,
you know what you ought to do?

707
01:01:49,240 --> 01:01:50,320
No.

708
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:53,560
You ought to take this money,

709
01:01:54,360 --> 01:01:57,680
take a little time off
from whatever it is that you do.

710
01:01:58,760 --> 01:02:02,440
Check into a nice, clean mental facility

711
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:06,520
where experts can properly diagnose
what exactly is wrong with you.

712
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,200
Maybe you could suggest to me
a mental facility,

713
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:13,000
because obviously you're running around
in a mental facility inside of your head.

714
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:15,080
You're letting this guy
fucking run the show?

715
01:02:15,160 --> 01:02:16,480
You're still not following the rules.

716
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:18,160
- You need help.
- Still arguing about the rules.

717
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:22,360
I'm not trying to instigate anything.
You need to get help, okay?

718
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:25,080
You need some fucking help.

719
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:28,520
You know what I need?

720
01:02:29,080 --> 01:02:33,480
I need you to clean that toilet.

721
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:39,720
- That's what I need.
- Enough. Enough of this shit, man.

722
01:02:40,040 --> 01:02:43,600
Toilet! It's not cleaning itself.

723
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:46,680
Let's just stop this, all right, guys?
Let's stop.

724
01:02:46,760 --> 01:02:48,240
You're in charge.
Does that make you happy?

725
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:52,880
Toilet! I need you to clean my toilet!

726
01:02:53,040 --> 01:02:55,440
- Fuck you!
- Fuck me?

727
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:58,160
Fuck. You.

728
01:02:58,680 --> 01:03:03,000
I don't normally like to use profanity,
but fuck you!

729
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:05,160
Fuck...

730
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:17,000
You are a prisoner, 77.

731
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:20,240
But your pride is getting in the way.

732
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:28,120
I think I need you to say it for me.

733
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:31,800
Say, "I am a prisoner."

734
01:03:32,440 --> 01:03:33,520
Fuck you.

735
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:41,400
Say it.

736
01:03:42,520 --> 01:03:43,600
Fuck...

737
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:57,000
Say it.

738
01:04:05,960 --> 01:04:07,000
Go to hell.

739
01:04:25,560 --> 01:04:27,120
Stop it, please.

740
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:31,960
Then say it for me.

741
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:37,680
I...

742
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,040
I am...

743
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:46,560
A prisoner. A prisoner.

744
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:51,400
A prisoner. I am a prisoner.

745
01:04:52,280 --> 01:04:56,160
Yes. Yes. Yes, 77.

746
01:04:57,760 --> 01:05:01,680
That is exactly what you are.

747
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:47,560
Hey. Talk to you for a minute?

748
01:06:54,920 --> 01:06:56,080
Come on.

749
01:07:04,080 --> 01:07:05,320
Let's go.

750
01:07:17,040 --> 01:07:21,640
- How come we can't talk back in the room?
- Some of the guys just wouldn't wait.

751
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:29,640
Whatever you guys are going to do,
please don't do it.

752
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:04,680
I think it's pretty clear by now there will be
a zero tolerance for breaking the rules.

753
01:08:13,480 --> 01:08:18,240
Bosch will be joining the prison population.

754
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:22,880
He will be referred to now as Prisoner 76.

755
01:08:24,320 --> 01:08:27,680
Is there a problem with that, Prisoner 77?

756
01:08:30,920 --> 01:08:31,960
Good.

757
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:39,840
I am an equitable man. Equitable. Equitable.

758
01:08:40,920 --> 01:08:46,800
<i>Not once, not once can you accuse me</i>

759
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:48,200
<i>of breaking the rules.</i>

760
01:08:48,280 --> 01:08:51,640
<i>The rules, they help us
because they guide us...</i>

761
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:58,920
<i>So that we can exist. So that we can exist.</i>

762
01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:01,160
Exist in this world.

763
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:06,000
Everybody's not happy with their lot in life.

764
01:09:06,920 --> 01:09:09,240
They have a position, he has a position,

765
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:13,280
and all of you, all of you,
you have your positions.

766
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:19,560
And I, I have a position.
Without the rules, there's chaos.

767
01:09:25,320 --> 01:09:26,640
Put that back on.

768
01:09:37,560 --> 01:09:40,400
I said, put that back on, 77.

769
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:47,960
Did you hear me, 77?

770
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:55,680
Put it back on! You put that back on.
You get back in the line.

771
01:09:56,160 --> 01:09:59,960
Don't take another step. What're you doing?
Just let him go by? Stop him!

772
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:04,080
Open the gate. You in there.

773
01:10:04,160 --> 01:10:05,160
- We're done.
- Seventy-seven.

774
01:10:05,320 --> 01:10:07,240
You hear me? We're done.

775
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:09,120
We're done.

776
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:17,320
Nobody speaks to them, do you hear me?
Nobody.

777
01:10:17,640 --> 01:10:21,360
Nobody can speak to them.
You don't say one single word to them!

778
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:25,520
That's rule number one now.
Nobody speaks to them!

779
01:10:25,560 --> 01:10:27,120
That's my friend!

780
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:48,480
You fucking lowlife! You piece of shit!

781
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:50,600
You couldn't just shut the fuck up,
could you?

782
01:10:50,680 --> 01:10:52,720
You brought this on your fucking self!

783
01:10:53,200 --> 01:10:54,520
Fuck you!

784
01:10:55,520 --> 01:10:59,000
Divide the prisoners up.
Isolate them so they can't communicate.

785
01:10:59,080 --> 01:11:02,440
The only strength in numbers
I want inside this place is ours.

786
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:58,480
How the fuck can you listen to that shit?
I can't even fucking think.

787
01:11:58,720 --> 01:11:59,880
All I know is I'm out of here.

788
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:04,200
You do know that any decisions we make,

789
01:12:04,280 --> 01:12:05,280
we make together?

790
01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:06,480
Well, this thing's over.

791
01:12:06,680 --> 01:12:08,120
We used violence
and the experiment's done.

792
01:12:08,200 --> 01:12:12,200
Is it? It's been a lot longer than half an hour
and red light hasn't come on yet.

793
01:12:12,280 --> 01:12:13,440
So fucking what?

794
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:17,320
If you think about this rationally,
it was the prisoners who did the violence.

795
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:19,400
We just responded commensurately.

796
01:12:19,480 --> 01:12:23,000
Fuck commensurately.
And fuck that fucking red light!

797
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:25,600
How can you say that?

798
01:12:26,040 --> 01:12:28,720
The red light,
that's the only thing that we have!

799
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:29,760
Don't you realize that?

800
01:12:33,080 --> 01:12:36,080
It's the only way that we can know.

801
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:41,040
Where's my music?

802
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:55,680
You can feel what's happening, right?

803
01:12:56,640 --> 01:12:59,520
You're fucking crazy. You know that?

804
01:13:01,200 --> 01:13:02,680
Can you feel it?

805
01:13:36,720 --> 01:13:42,480
What? Camera? Camera.

806
01:13:47,320 --> 01:13:50,360
Why? Why would you have...

807
01:13:50,440 --> 01:13:53,360
Why don't you stop this? Why?

808
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:23,720
I'll fucking kill you. Kill. I'll fucking kill you.

809
01:14:44,280 --> 01:14:47,280
I'm going to take that tape off of you.

810
01:14:47,320 --> 01:14:50,200
And you're going to give me what I want.
Okay?

811
01:14:52,600 --> 01:14:53,600
Fuck you.

812
01:14:56,600 --> 01:14:59,440
You're a fucking faggot. You know that.

813
01:15:03,080 --> 01:15:08,280
Aren't you afraid? Yeah. Yeah.

814
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:11,240
I know you.

815
01:15:27,240 --> 01:15:32,320
You didn't think I would see?
You didn't think I was smart enough?

816
01:15:38,920 --> 01:15:40,560
Please don't hit me again.

817
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:42,480
Hey, I was going to try to be nice.

818
01:15:52,040 --> 01:15:53,880
Fucking kill you.

819
01:16:04,520 --> 01:16:05,680
Please.

820
01:16:08,920 --> 01:16:12,400
You know, if your mouth
doesn't want to play nice,

821
01:16:14,840 --> 01:16:17,360
we'll just have to use the other end.

822
01:16:29,880 --> 01:16:32,680
No. No, no, please. Wait, wait. Time out.

823
01:16:32,760 --> 01:16:35,880
- Shut up!
- Time out, time out.

824
01:17:04,640 --> 01:17:07,120
No. Please don't do this.

825
01:17:09,320 --> 01:17:10,280
Hi.

826
01:17:21,400 --> 01:17:23,120
Go to sleep, motherfucker, go to sleep.

827
01:17:23,720 --> 01:17:26,120
You think fags are funny?
Who's funny now?

828
01:17:35,640 --> 01:17:41,240
- Hey, kid. You all right?
- No. Thank you. Thank you.

829
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:55,040
You still want to go along and get along?

830
01:17:55,560 --> 01:17:56,680
Fuck no.

831
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:05,360
These boys must think I'm somebody else.

832
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:19,280
Everybody's out, man.

833
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:24,440
Hey, buddy. Hey, man.

834
01:18:45,080 --> 01:18:47,160
No, no, no. Come on.

835
01:19:02,960 --> 01:19:05,040
Barris, we got trouble.

836
01:19:10,160 --> 01:19:11,120
Coming for you!

837
01:19:11,640 --> 01:19:12,560
Jesus.

838
01:19:38,200 --> 01:19:40,240
Jesus. What'll we do?

839
01:19:41,560 --> 01:19:42,640
We get ready.

840
01:19:45,240 --> 01:19:49,240
You're fucking losing it, man.
They outnumber us two to one.

841
01:19:56,440 --> 01:20:01,000
Maybe, but they're still prisoners.
And they're still scared of us.

842
01:20:03,520 --> 01:20:05,440
We're the authority here.

843
01:20:08,200 --> 01:20:10,760
Does that look like they give a fuck?

844
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,200
Fuck your authority.

845
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:18,840
About fucking time.

846
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:05,280
What're you doing? What are you doing?
We got to stand and fight!

847
01:21:05,400 --> 01:21:08,960
This is our world!
You cannot take it from us! No!

848
01:21:09,280 --> 01:21:10,360
Why are you doing this?

849
01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:12,720
We're still guards! Guards!

850
01:21:31,480 --> 01:21:33,320
This is your fault!

851
01:26:01,960 --> 01:26:06,000
You still think we're higher
on the evolutionary chain than monkeys?

852
01:26:14,120 --> 01:26:15,280
Yeah.

853
01:26:17,840 --> 01:26:20,600
'Cause we can still do something about it.

854
01:26:24,840 --> 01:26:25,840
<i>The facility is actively leased</i>

855
01:26:25,920 --> 01:26:29,520
<i>by a corporate think-tank
reported to have ties to the government.</i>

856
01:26:29,560 --> 01:26:31,640
A spokesperson with the Monad Corporation

857
01:26:31,720 --> 01:26:34,560
tells us the facility has been used
for psychological testing.

858
01:26:34,640 --> 01:26:37,400
Yes, we'll testify. Whatever it takes.

859
01:26:37,480 --> 01:26:40,360
A guy died in there.
A guy named Benjy Putterman.

860
01:26:40,440 --> 01:26:43,000
<i>... arrested the lead researcher,
a Dr. John Archalata,</i>

861
01:26:43,080 --> 01:26:45,200
<i>and charged him with manslaughter.</i>

862
01:26:45,240 --> 01:26:47,280
<i>We'll bring you more
as the situation develops.</i>
