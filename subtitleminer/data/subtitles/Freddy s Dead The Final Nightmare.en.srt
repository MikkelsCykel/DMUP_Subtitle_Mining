00:01:29,936 --> 00:01:31,335
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen

2
00:01:31,371 --> 00:01:32,633
This is the pilot speaking

3
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:35,197
You'll notice the ''fasten
seat belts'' sign is on

4
00:01:35,242 --> 00:01:37,335
Passing through
a little turbulence here

5
00:01:37,377 --> 00:01:40,835
Unfortunately,
we can't get up over it

6
00:01:40,881 --> 00:01:43,008
and we can't
get underneath it, so

7
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:45,244
just hang in there

8
00:01:45,285 --> 00:01:46,445
Excuse me, miss?

9
00:01:50,056 --> 00:01:51,683
Can l have
a different seat, please?

10
00:01:52,325 --> 00:01:54,657
Oh, l'm afraid
we're full tonight, sir

11
00:01:54,694 --> 00:01:56,252
You're gonna have to stay put

12
00:01:57,097 --> 00:01:58,428
Thanks anyway

13
00:02:25,158 --> 00:02:26,682
He's going to make you
help him

14
00:02:27,861 --> 00:02:29,351
because you're the last

15
00:02:40,006 --> 00:02:41,234
Listen

16
00:02:41,274 --> 00:02:43,936
l really need
to change this seat

17
00:02:43,977 --> 00:02:46,275
l'm sorry
There's nothing l can do

18
00:02:48,648 --> 00:02:49,945
l'm afraid of heights

19
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,217
Don't be a pussy

20
00:03:01,027 --> 00:03:04,394
lt's not fair! l was almost out!

21
00:03:52,112 --> 00:03:53,511
Shit!

22
00:04:22,976 --> 00:04:25,001
l'll get you, my pretty

23
00:04:25,045 --> 00:04:27,343
and your little soul, too!

24
00:06:55,862 --> 00:06:57,420
One ticket

25
00:06:59,165 --> 00:07:00,757
Round trip

26
00:07:02,936 --> 00:07:04,062
Hurry up, boy

27
00:07:04,104 --> 00:07:06,937
You don't wanna miss the bus

28
00:07:32,132 --> 00:07:34,930
No screaming
while the bus in in motion

29
00:08:09,636 --> 00:08:12,628
Now be a good little doggy

30
00:08:13,306 --> 00:08:14,500
and go fetch!

31
00:09:34,287 --> 00:09:37,745
Spencer, l wanna make sure
you understand our situation

32
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:40,623
ln one week,
you walk out of here

33
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:44,152
and l expect some changes in
your behavior when you get home

34
00:09:45,531 --> 00:09:46,793
l know you're hearing me

35
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:48,892
l put you in here
because you gave me no choice

36
00:09:48,935 --> 00:09:51,563
Next time, l'll leave you here

37
00:09:51,604 --> 00:09:52,764
Thanks for the visit, Dad

38
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:58,977
Nice job on my kid

39
00:09:59,012 --> 00:10:00,775
l expected to see
some improvement

40
00:10:00,813 --> 00:10:02,280
He isn't a Toyota

41
00:10:02,849 --> 00:10:04,009
What a jerk

42
00:10:10,189 --> 00:10:11,520
You OK?

43
00:10:11,557 --> 00:10:14,321
Yeah Dad just came by
to lay down some ground rules

44
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,486
for when l come home--

45
00:10:15,528 --> 00:10:18,520
no more running away, no more
setting his cars on fire

46
00:10:18,564 --> 00:10:19,690
There are other ways
to get his attention

47
00:10:19,732 --> 00:10:21,199
besides blowing up the garage

48
00:10:21,234 --> 00:10:22,701
Yeah He barely even blinked

49
00:10:24,203 --> 00:10:26,865
All he wants me to do now
is grow up to be him--

50
00:10:26,906 --> 00:10:28,840
an exact copy

51
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:31,605
l don't feel like playing
football and date-raping coeds

52
00:10:31,644 --> 00:10:34,078
One of these days, you're going
to have to face your father

53
00:10:34,113 --> 00:10:35,273
Maggie

54
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:38,975
look what l found
in Spencer's room

55
00:10:39,018 --> 00:10:40,679
A pipe bomb, huh?

56
00:10:41,387 --> 00:10:44,879
That? Just showing the kids
survival techniques

57
00:10:50,229 --> 00:10:52,527
Been confiscating stuff
like this all week

58
00:10:52,565 --> 00:10:54,032
Where do they get it?

59
00:10:54,067 --> 00:10:56,467
l'll put this downstairs
with the rest of the arsenal

60
00:10:56,502 --> 00:10:58,561
Weren't the police supposed
to dispose of that stuff?

61
00:10:58,604 --> 00:11:01,368
The police are supposed
to do a lot of things

62
00:11:01,407 --> 00:11:03,602
-Get your hands off of me!
-Tracy!

63
00:11:03,643 --> 00:11:05,873
-What's the problem?
-She was beating on another kid

64
00:11:05,912 --> 00:11:07,140
He was hitting on me!

65
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:09,148
She doesn't like
to be touched

66
00:11:10,016 --> 00:11:12,177
We have a session today, yes?

67
00:11:12,218 --> 00:11:13,708
l have Doc's class

68
00:11:13,753 --> 00:11:14,913
Work around him

69
00:11:16,189 --> 00:11:17,588
l'm sorry, sir

70
00:11:22,695 --> 00:11:24,424
You seen this junkie before?

71
00:11:25,164 --> 00:11:26,597
No He's new

72
00:11:26,632 --> 00:11:30,568
Beautiful Another afternoon
shot doing juvie paperwork

73
00:11:30,603 --> 00:11:31,831
Screw that shit

74
00:11:31,871 --> 00:11:34,066
Let's just scoop him up
and take him to the shelter

75
00:11:34,841 --> 00:11:37,332
Let the bleeding hearts
do the typing

76
00:11:39,045 --> 00:11:41,343
That's it Come on, Tracy
That's it

77
00:11:41,381 --> 00:11:43,872
Oh, yeah She's bad
The crowd loves her!

78
00:11:43,916 --> 00:11:45,042
She's getting ready

79
00:11:45,084 --> 00:11:48,349
for the heavyweight champion
boxing match of the world

80
00:11:48,388 --> 00:11:49,855
Hey, hey, hey Look at her go

81
00:11:49,889 --> 00:11:51,481
You know, you are sexy
when you sweat

82
00:11:53,326 --> 00:11:56,022
You ain't gettin' none, Carlos!

83
00:11:56,062 --> 00:11:58,223
You wouldn't hit a guy
with a handicap, would you?

84
00:11:58,264 --> 00:12:00,664
Oh, you call it a handicap?

85
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,429
l call it chicken, man!
Come on, let's spar

86
00:12:02,468 --> 00:12:04,868
-No, no Forget it, Trace
-Come on--

87
00:12:10,543 --> 00:12:12,534
Don't tune out Why don't you
talk back to her for once?

88
00:12:12,578 --> 00:12:14,808
Oh, yeah, right Like you
talk back to your father?

89
00:12:14,847 --> 00:12:17,611
Let me tell you something
l stopped talking back

90
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:19,709
when it became hazardous
to my health, you know?

91
00:12:21,521 --> 00:12:22,681
So, are we set?

92
00:12:22,722 --> 00:12:25,486
Yeah No problem
l gave the van driver our cash

93
00:12:25,525 --> 00:12:27,459
As long as we do it before dawn,
we're home free

94
00:12:27,493 --> 00:12:31,122
We're gonna be livin' large
in Cali before the week is out

95
00:12:32,031 --> 00:12:33,658
You better be sure, man

96
00:12:33,699 --> 00:12:35,326
Trust me, all right?
l got it all covered

97
00:12:35,368 --> 00:12:37,427
l need to get outta here
even more than you do

98
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:39,700
You don't know shit
about needing to get out!

99
00:12:39,739 --> 00:12:41,331
Your family's a picnic,
rich boy!

100
00:12:41,374 --> 00:12:44,036
What? You think l hang around
you morons by choice?

101
00:12:44,077 --> 00:12:45,669
Least your father
didn't try to set you up

102
00:12:45,711 --> 00:12:47,542
with his girlfriend's
older sister

103
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:49,343
Don't talk to me about fathers

104
00:12:49,382 --> 00:12:50,781
Yours come to visit, too?

105
00:12:51,818 --> 00:12:53,945
Yeah--
every time l close my eyes

106
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:09,760
That did it Yep OK

107
00:13:09,802 --> 00:13:11,292
They caught
one of your star pupils

108
00:13:11,337 --> 00:13:13,237
beating up
on one of our kids again

109
00:13:14,173 --> 00:13:15,868
Thought you said
you were making progress

110
00:13:16,909 --> 00:13:19,139
l only get twenty-three minutes
a week with these kids

111
00:13:19,178 --> 00:13:20,645
With that kind of attention

112
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,147
you're lucky
she didn't kill him

113
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:25,551
That's a good attitude
for a therapist

114
00:13:25,585 --> 00:13:29,248
Tracy's got some deep trauma
buried inside of her head

115
00:13:29,288 --> 00:13:31,848
Conventional therapy
is not going to work

116
00:13:31,891 --> 00:13:34,223
And dream therapy is, huh?

117
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:35,659
You're such a hippie

118
00:13:36,295 --> 00:13:39,287
l can reach these kids
through their dreams

119
00:13:39,332 --> 00:13:41,323
You give me a chance, l can help
you with your little problem

120
00:13:41,367 --> 00:13:43,335
l don't have a little problem

121
00:13:43,369 --> 00:13:45,667
l just have
a little reoccurring dream

122
00:13:45,705 --> 00:13:47,332
and l'm handling it fine

123
00:13:47,373 --> 00:13:49,773
And you are not being paid
to be a dream doctor

124
00:13:49,809 --> 00:13:51,299
l'm barely being paid

125
00:13:51,344 --> 00:13:53,005
That's why l gotta do
what l think is right

126
00:13:53,045 --> 00:13:54,410
This is new

127
00:13:54,447 --> 00:13:55,607
You like it?

128
00:13:57,183 --> 00:14:00,346
These are ancient dream demons

129
00:14:00,386 --> 00:14:03,184
Supposedly they roam
the dreams of the living

130
00:14:03,222 --> 00:14:07,124
till they find
the most evil, twisted

131
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,491
human imaginable

132
00:14:10,329 --> 00:14:12,889
Then they give him
the power to cross the line

133
00:14:12,932 --> 00:14:15,298
and turn our nightmares
into reality

134
00:14:16,235 --> 00:14:19,033
Maggie, cops just brought in
another kid Real mess

135
00:14:19,071 --> 00:14:21,904
Hasn't sleep for days,
bad case of amnesia

136
00:14:21,941 --> 00:14:23,670
We need your evaluation
right away

137
00:14:28,514 --> 00:14:30,004
How long have you been awake?

138
00:14:30,049 --> 00:14:31,710
As far as l can remember?

139
00:14:31,751 --> 00:14:34,015
l don't know About three days

140
00:14:36,189 --> 00:14:38,054
Looks more like three weeks

141
00:14:40,026 --> 00:14:42,790
Yeah, well,
that's the wonder of amnesia--

142
00:14:43,563 --> 00:14:45,258
always keeps you guessing

143
00:14:45,298 --> 00:14:46,629
Where you from?

144
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:48,463
l don't know!

145
00:14:50,403 --> 00:14:53,395
All l know
is that wherever l'm from

146
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:54,736
l was the last

147
00:14:54,774 --> 00:14:55,968
The last what?

148
00:14:56,008 --> 00:14:57,202
Survivor

149
00:14:58,444 --> 00:15:01,607
Look, do you have any

150
00:15:01,647 --> 00:15:04,741
caffeine pills or coffee?
Maybe some coke?

151
00:15:06,118 --> 00:15:08,143
l meant the soda

152
00:15:11,057 --> 00:15:12,217
Sit down

153
00:15:23,836 --> 00:15:25,030
Why do you want to stay awake?

154
00:15:25,071 --> 00:15:26,834
Because if l fall asleep

155
00:15:28,507 --> 00:15:29,940
l'm not waking up

156
00:15:29,976 --> 00:15:31,102
Why do you think that?

157
00:15:31,143 --> 00:15:33,805
l don't think it l feel it

158
00:15:36,349 --> 00:15:38,817
lf l fall asleep

159
00:15:38,851 --> 00:15:40,284
there's gonna be trouble

160
00:15:44,156 --> 00:15:45,646
Springwood

161
00:15:48,427 --> 00:15:49,655
Water tower

162
00:15:56,369 --> 00:16:00,203
Four thousand five hundred
and sixty-seven

163
00:16:00,239 --> 00:16:02,639
Bottles of beer on the wall

164
00:16:03,776 --> 00:16:07,405
Four thousand five hundred
and sixty-seven

165
00:16:07,446 --> 00:16:09,311
Bottles of beer

166
00:16:10,883 --> 00:16:14,614
lf one of those bottles
should happen to fall

167
00:16:14,654 --> 00:16:17,248
What a case of--

168
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:18,780
Hey, l'll break a bottle
over your head

169
00:16:18,824 --> 00:16:20,815
if you don't shut the fuck up!

170
00:16:24,463 --> 00:16:28,297
Four thousand five hundred
and sixty-six

171
00:16:28,334 --> 00:16:30,768
Bottles of beer on the wall

172
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,330
l won't tell

173
00:16:55,027 --> 00:16:56,153
Now you're it

174
00:16:56,195 --> 00:16:57,594
Remember what you have to do

175
00:16:57,630 --> 00:16:59,188
You got to tag me

176
00:17:00,232 --> 00:17:01,392
That's it

177
00:17:05,805 --> 00:17:07,568
Come to Daddy

178
00:17:40,873 --> 00:17:42,135
Play with me

179
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:44,866
Tell me who l am

180
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:46,502
l won't tell

181
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,792
Free me, you idiot!
l'm your fucking memory!

182
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:53,200
Oh, shit

183
00:18:55,581 --> 00:18:56,570
Asshole

184
00:18:59,218 --> 00:19:01,118
What were you dreaming about?

185
00:19:03,622 --> 00:19:05,249
A room

186
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:07,088
A house

187
00:19:07,126 --> 00:19:08,684
A little girl

188
00:19:09,895 --> 00:19:12,887
Something about the town
from my article

189
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:16,029
l remember a water tower

190
00:19:19,939 --> 00:19:22,339
The article--do you remember
where you got it?

191
00:19:23,609 --> 00:19:26,271
The little girl--
what did she look like?

192
00:19:26,312 --> 00:19:28,143
Brown hair with

193
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:29,579
red ribbons

194
00:19:33,986 --> 00:19:35,112
l don't like it

195
00:19:35,154 --> 00:19:37,748
There's some connection between
your dreams and his dreams

196
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:40,350
and his dreams mean bad news

197
00:19:40,392 --> 00:19:42,519
l know you think l'm crazy,
but l can feel it

198
00:19:42,561 --> 00:19:45,553
Why can't anybody talk about
anything but dreams around here?

199
00:19:45,598 --> 00:19:48,032
l'm so sick of hearing
about this bullshit!

200
00:19:48,067 --> 00:19:49,193
You don't believe that

201
00:19:49,235 --> 00:19:51,703
You think solving this boy's
puzzle can help with your own

202
00:19:51,737 --> 00:19:53,204
l don't have a puzzle

203
00:19:55,608 --> 00:19:57,405
Yes, you do

204
00:19:57,443 --> 00:19:58,876
And although you think
you know everything

205
00:19:58,911 --> 00:20:01,607
you may not be ready to face
what this boy will show you

206
00:20:01,647 --> 00:20:03,308
l never said l wanted
to go back there

207
00:20:03,349 --> 00:20:05,317
l've dealt
with amnesiacs before

208
00:20:05,351 --> 00:20:07,751
Take you to Springwood,
it's gonna trigger something--

209
00:20:07,786 --> 00:20:09,344
some spark to help you remember

210
00:20:09,388 --> 00:20:12,653
l don't need a spark to remember
that it was a bad place

211
00:20:12,691 --> 00:20:14,022
You want a spark? You go

212
00:20:14,059 --> 00:20:16,289
l'll stay here,
sparkless but happy

213
00:20:16,328 --> 00:20:18,489
l'll be right there with you
Don't worry

214
00:20:18,531 --> 00:20:21,364
Kelly, we're gonna take
the van for awhile

215
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:53,393
l told you not to let me
fall asleep

216
00:20:53,432 --> 00:20:55,093
Was that too much to ask for?

217
00:20:59,238 --> 00:21:00,830
Go back

218
00:21:00,873 --> 00:21:02,898
Oh, my God! Pull over!

219
00:21:02,942 --> 00:21:04,102
John, wake up!

220
00:21:09,214 --> 00:21:11,239
Shit Great

221
00:21:13,352 --> 00:21:14,819
Funny meeting you here

222
00:21:14,853 --> 00:21:16,548
Nice driving

223
00:21:17,556 --> 00:21:19,615
What the hell are you guys
doing here?

224
00:21:20,459 --> 00:21:21,653
Great plan, asshole

225
00:21:21,694 --> 00:21:24,254
-lt almost worked, all right?
-l can't believe you people

226
00:21:24,296 --> 00:21:27,459
Pulling a stunt like that

227
00:21:27,499 --> 00:21:29,660
Oh, my God

228
00:21:29,702 --> 00:21:32,500
Look, the first thing we have
to do is find a telephone

229
00:21:32,538 --> 00:21:34,335
and you call Kelly
and tell him where you are

230
00:21:34,373 --> 00:21:35,670
You understand?

231
00:21:35,708 --> 00:21:38,199
And then we have to figure out
how to get you home

232
00:21:38,243 --> 00:21:39,870
Are you listening?

233
00:21:39,912 --> 00:21:41,140
Don't scream at me!

234
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:42,875
lt was your driving
that almost killed us

235
00:22:12,344 --> 00:22:14,608
Two for a dollar, right here!

236
00:22:14,647 --> 00:22:15,841
Get 'em, two!

237
00:22:16,849 --> 00:22:18,043
Two for a dollar!

238
00:22:19,351 --> 00:22:22,514
First l want you to find
a phone, call Kelly

239
00:22:22,554 --> 00:22:23,816
and tell him you're all right

240
00:22:23,856 --> 00:22:25,323
Then l want you
to get in that van

241
00:22:25,357 --> 00:22:27,154
and drive straight back
to the shelter

242
00:22:27,192 --> 00:22:28,523
Think you can handle that

243
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,027
or do l have to call
the police?

244
00:22:34,166 --> 00:22:35,793
Get away from here You go away!

245
00:22:35,834 --> 00:22:37,859
''Or do l have to call
the police?''

246
00:22:38,671 --> 00:22:39,899
She ain't my mother

247
00:22:41,674 --> 00:22:43,869
We want some peach cobbler
here and

248
00:22:58,323 --> 00:23:00,086
-There are no kids
-What?

249
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:02,518
Town fair

250
00:23:02,561 --> 00:23:04,222
and there are no kids

251
00:23:15,474 --> 00:23:17,669
-So what's up, Spence?
-This phone's out of order

252
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:18,972
So is this town

253
00:23:19,011 --> 00:23:20,035
You are not kidding

254
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:24,539
Oh, what beautiful,
adorable children!

255
00:23:24,583 --> 00:23:26,312
Would you like to come
and live with us?

256
00:23:26,351 --> 00:23:29,650
lt's been so long since
we've had children in the house

257
00:23:29,688 --> 00:23:31,622
So long

258
00:23:31,657 --> 00:23:33,818
This time,
l swear it'll be different

259
00:23:33,859 --> 00:23:35,554
This time, l'll be careful

260
00:23:35,594 --> 00:23:38,324
and l'll hide you better,
so that he'll never find you

261
00:23:38,363 --> 00:23:40,831
Looky, l got your nose! Looky!

262
00:23:40,866 --> 00:23:42,026
Ethel!

263
00:23:44,036 --> 00:23:46,834
l want my children back!

264
00:23:46,872 --> 00:23:48,362
You know they bring him !

265
00:23:56,882 --> 00:23:58,679
Now see what you done did?!

266
00:23:59,818 --> 00:24:01,445
Jesus

267
00:24:01,487 --> 00:24:03,785
-We're in Twin Peaks here
-Definitely

268
00:24:03,822 --> 00:24:04,948
Have we seen enough?

269
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:06,321
-Yeah
-Good

270
00:24:09,495 --> 00:24:11,554
Come on, back in the van

271
00:24:11,597 --> 00:24:13,292
That's a very good idea

272
00:24:13,332 --> 00:24:14,697
Now Go!

273
00:24:14,733 --> 00:24:15,893
Jeez

274
00:24:22,775 --> 00:24:24,003
l hope they make it

275
00:24:24,042 --> 00:24:25,771
Let's see what they can tell us
at the school

276
00:24:26,678 --> 00:24:29,272
-What?
-Somebody rang those bells

277
00:24:30,015 --> 00:24:31,175
Lucky us

278
00:24:48,634 --> 00:24:50,693
Trace, there's a map back here

279
00:24:50,736 --> 00:24:52,328
Did l say l needed a map?

280
00:24:52,371 --> 00:24:54,862
l can't get over the way
those people looked at us

281
00:24:54,907 --> 00:24:56,568
Yeah, that was weird

282
00:25:06,285 --> 00:25:07,547
Shit

283
00:25:09,655 --> 00:25:10,849
Nice going

284
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:14,218
Takes talent to travel
in a complete circle

285
00:25:14,259 --> 00:25:15,886
And you're making me dizzy

286
00:25:16,962 --> 00:25:18,725
Jeez

287
00:25:18,764 --> 00:25:20,095
Do you have to do that?

288
00:25:20,132 --> 00:25:22,293
You're such a high ho,
you know that?

289
00:25:22,334 --> 00:25:24,825
l don't play that shit
l need all the senses l've got

290
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:26,861
Put that fucking thing out

291
00:25:26,905 --> 00:25:28,031
lt's hard enough
staying awake

292
00:25:28,073 --> 00:25:29,938
without you lighting up
every ten seconds

293
00:25:29,975 --> 00:25:32,773
-This relaxes me
-l'll relax you

294
00:25:32,811 --> 00:25:34,335
l'll just puncture your heart

295
00:25:34,379 --> 00:25:35,971
mess up these seats

296
00:25:36,014 --> 00:25:37,242
You need to get laid

297
00:25:37,282 --> 00:25:39,045
Would you like the map now?

298
00:25:39,985 --> 00:25:41,953
No, l don't need any map

299
00:25:42,921 --> 00:25:44,582
No, of course not

300
00:25:54,466 --> 00:25:55,626
-Why'd you stop?
-Look

301
00:26:26,265 --> 00:26:27,596
Oh, great

302
00:26:30,068 --> 00:26:31,262
Give me the map

303
00:26:32,838 --> 00:26:35,102
Not a word

304
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:37,665
Carlos, l asked you for the map!

305
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:06,430
What is this?!

306
00:27:14,479 --> 00:27:16,174
l asked you for the map

307
00:27:16,214 --> 00:27:17,977
What?

308
00:27:20,319 --> 00:27:22,378
Yeah, well,
the map says we're fucked

309
00:27:24,222 --> 00:27:26,656
Look, you've had two chances
Now it's my turn

310
00:27:31,163 --> 00:27:32,289
Dickhead

311
00:27:32,331 --> 00:27:33,491
Nice

312
00:27:51,984 --> 00:27:54,384
You'll all be expected
to pass

313
00:27:54,419 --> 00:27:57,513
both the written
and an oral examination

314
00:27:58,790 --> 00:28:00,018
Don't disturb him

315
00:28:00,726 --> 00:28:04,059
You will need to study

316
00:28:04,096 --> 00:28:05,290
this

317
00:28:09,067 --> 00:28:11,262
Now the dates
Got to get the dates right

318
00:28:11,303 --> 00:28:12,770
Got to keep them in order

319
00:28:12,804 --> 00:28:14,931
lf you get them out of order,
you'll get very confused

320
00:28:34,393 --> 00:28:35,519
You were here

321
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,720
What?

322
00:28:40,165 --> 00:28:41,325
Welcome

323
00:28:43,168 --> 00:28:44,726

324
00:28:46,438 --> 00:28:48,303
1493--

325
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:50,865
Freddy sailed across the sea

326
00:28:57,249 --> 00:28:59,183
These dates, they're all
within a ten-year period

327
00:28:59,217 --> 00:29:01,242
What the hell happened here?

328
00:29:01,286 --> 00:29:02,981
Freddy happened here

329
00:29:04,256 --> 00:29:06,224
Here was the crucial point

330
00:29:06,258 --> 00:29:07,691
Anybody know
what l'm getting at?

331
00:29:08,527 --> 00:29:09,755
Anybody? Hmm?

332
00:29:09,795 --> 00:29:12,195
Come on, people!

333
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:13,060
We covered this!

334
00:29:13,899 --> 00:29:16,993
This is where
they took away his child

335
00:29:17,035 --> 00:29:18,332
What child?

336
00:29:18,370 --> 00:29:19,496
Taken away

337
00:29:19,538 --> 00:29:21,335
put in the town orphanage

338
00:29:21,373 --> 00:29:22,635
Freddy had a kid

339
00:29:27,813 --> 00:29:31,305
1494--

340
00:29:32,317 --> 00:29:34,080
Freddy came back

341
00:29:34,119 --> 00:29:35,609
to look

342
00:29:35,654 --> 00:29:36,985
for more

343
00:29:44,663 --> 00:29:45,925
There's no way out

344
00:29:45,964 --> 00:29:47,295
Not with you driving

345
00:29:47,332 --> 00:29:49,232
Yeah, well,
you didn't do much better

346
00:29:49,267 --> 00:29:51,497
No, but at least l did it
in half the time

347
00:29:54,339 --> 00:29:55,966
Come on Where are you going?

348
00:29:56,007 --> 00:29:57,770
Away

349
00:29:57,809 --> 00:29:59,299
Look, we're just too fried
to see straight

350
00:29:59,344 --> 00:30:00,470
Let's just find Maggie

351
00:30:00,512 --> 00:30:04,278
l'm not turning myself over
for any adult supervision

352
00:30:04,316 --> 00:30:05,908
This girl's getting some rest

353
00:30:06,918 --> 00:30:09,819
ln fact, l think l see my kinda
neighborhood up ahead--

354
00:30:09,855 --> 00:30:10,981
empty

355
00:30:11,022 --> 00:30:12,489
You know, she's losing it

356
00:30:12,524 --> 00:30:14,321
Sad thing is,
l'm starting to like her

357
00:30:14,359 --> 00:30:15,587
That is sad

358
00:30:16,228 --> 00:30:18,025
Come on, Trace Wait up!

359
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:36,847
This is the one

360
00:30:36,882 --> 00:30:38,713
We'll have it all to ourselves

361
00:30:39,484 --> 00:30:42,009
-Bet there's no heat
-No plumbing, right?

362
00:30:42,053 --> 00:30:43,384
You'll survive

363
00:30:45,557 --> 00:30:46,888
Come on

364
00:31:29,367 --> 00:31:30,493
Where you going?

365
00:31:30,535 --> 00:31:33,663
Gonna go upstairs
and find a bed Man, l'm tired

366
00:31:33,705 --> 00:31:35,434
l gotta find a bathroom

367
00:31:36,641 --> 00:31:39,542
This place makes the shelter
look like the Ritz

368
00:32:00,899 --> 00:32:02,093
Great

369
00:32:03,034 --> 00:32:04,194
Well

370
00:32:06,238 --> 00:32:09,901
at least it beats the streets,
right, Carlos?

371
00:32:11,343 --> 00:32:13,004
Ohh, this is good

372
00:32:14,246 --> 00:32:15,713
l'm gonna get some sleep

373
00:32:15,747 --> 00:32:18,443
and l will get us out of here
in the morning

374
00:32:30,061 --> 00:32:32,825
Why do you think that kid
said not to fall asleep?

375
00:32:32,864 --> 00:32:34,491
'Cause he's a lame-o freak

376
00:32:36,067 --> 00:32:37,796
Miss Maggie's pet psycho

377
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:06,561
Where the hell are you?

378
00:33:06,598 --> 00:33:08,964
Why aren't you listening
to me, Carlos?

379
00:33:26,351 --> 00:33:27,978
Tracy, where are you?

380
00:33:28,019 --> 00:33:29,577
Behind you

381
00:33:33,758 --> 00:33:34,918
Mama?

382
00:33:39,998 --> 00:33:42,091
Maybe you don't hear so good

383
00:33:42,967 --> 00:33:46,630
Maybe l clean out your ears
for you

384
00:33:46,671 --> 00:33:48,832
No, no Mama, please,
l've been a good boy

385
00:33:48,873 --> 00:33:50,135
You don't understand

386
00:33:50,175 --> 00:33:52,006
l've been good, Mama!

387
00:33:52,043 --> 00:33:55,103
Don't make me deaf, Mama!
Please! l'm sorry!

388
00:33:55,146 --> 00:33:56,306
l'm not

389
00:34:11,663 --> 00:34:14,757
Oh, Carlos, lend me your ear

390
00:35:42,287 --> 00:35:47,850
Give me my hearing back!

391
00:36:14,986 --> 00:36:16,453
Where is it?

392
00:37:09,374 --> 00:37:11,569
Y-you wouldn't do that,
would you, man?

393
00:37:12,577 --> 00:37:13,703
No, no, no! Please!

394
00:37:13,745 --> 00:37:14,905
No, man!

395
00:38:33,491 --> 00:38:36,016
Nice hearing from you, Carlos

396
00:38:56,247 --> 00:38:57,805
l can't find Carlos

397
00:38:58,883 --> 00:39:00,316
See what's on this TV?

398
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:04,888
l'm gonna take the van
l'm gonna look for him

399
00:39:12,797 --> 00:39:14,025
Give me some room !

400
00:39:16,901 --> 00:39:18,334
Don't fall asleep, man!

401
00:39:18,369 --> 00:39:19,495
Get out!

402
00:39:19,537 --> 00:39:21,471
Spencer, get out, man!

403
00:39:21,506 --> 00:39:23,201
Carlos, man

404
00:39:23,975 --> 00:39:25,966
we were just looking for you

405
00:39:28,146 --> 00:39:29,943
Don't fall asleep, man!

406
00:39:29,981 --> 00:39:32,211
Spencer, you stupid stoner!

407
00:39:41,392 --> 00:39:43,155
We shouldn't even be here

408
00:39:45,997 --> 00:39:47,396
We're supposed to be
finding out about you

409
00:39:47,432 --> 00:39:49,832
not some dead killer's kid

410
00:39:49,867 --> 00:39:52,597
We might be talking
about the same thing

411
00:39:52,637 --> 00:39:55,299
The whole town's obsessing
on this Krueger character

412
00:39:55,339 --> 00:39:56,829
Don't you start

413
00:39:58,342 --> 00:40:01,243
But why else
would they be afraid of me?

414
00:40:01,279 --> 00:40:04,077
Why else am l still alive
when everybody else is dead?

415
00:40:04,115 --> 00:40:06,811
Skip, skip, skip to my loo

416
00:40:06,851 --> 00:40:09,376
Skip to my loo, my darling

417
00:40:18,696 --> 00:40:20,664
Martha, no running

418
00:40:20,698 --> 00:40:22,063
Everyone hold hands

419
00:40:24,368 --> 00:40:26,529
Oh, you've come back

420
00:40:26,571 --> 00:40:27,970
How nice

421
00:40:28,973 --> 00:40:30,201
Do you remember me?

422
00:40:30,241 --> 00:40:31,868
Well, of course l do, my boy

423
00:40:31,909 --> 00:40:34,776
l remember
every one of my children

424
00:40:34,812 --> 00:40:36,074
Especially you

425
00:40:36,881 --> 00:40:38,712
What a pretty little girl
you were

426
00:40:39,617 --> 00:40:41,346
And l remember you

427
00:40:41,385 --> 00:40:43,376
and you

428
00:40:43,421 --> 00:40:44,752
Do you remember
the Krueger child?

429
00:40:44,789 --> 00:40:46,256
Of course

430
00:40:46,290 --> 00:40:48,155
Who was it?

431
00:40:48,192 --> 00:40:50,683
We're not permitted to disclose
a child's real identity

432
00:40:50,728 --> 00:40:52,719
Oh, Melissa Melissa

433
00:40:52,764 --> 00:40:54,891
You must let Bobby
have the ball

434
00:40:55,933 --> 00:40:57,901
Come here That's all right

435
00:40:57,935 --> 00:40:59,266
We share

436
00:40:59,303 --> 00:41:02,272
l wonder who has a little
bare footie around here?

437
00:41:02,306 --> 00:41:03,671
''K Krueger''

438
00:41:03,708 --> 00:41:05,801
Could mean anything
from Kevin to Kyle

439
00:41:05,843 --> 00:41:08,311
All it really means is there was
a child here by that name

440
00:41:09,413 --> 00:41:12,143
No lt's me

441
00:41:15,353 --> 00:41:17,150
l'm his kid

442
00:41:17,188 --> 00:41:19,122
That's why he's kept me alive

443
00:41:20,391 --> 00:41:22,325
He's trying to play
some sick game with me

444
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:24,828
He is dead, all right?

445
00:41:24,862 --> 00:41:26,625
He's dead,
and you're not his kid

446
00:41:27,665 --> 00:41:29,326
How do you know?

447
00:41:29,367 --> 00:41:30,994
She remembered me

448
00:41:31,035 --> 00:41:32,502
She remembered me, too

449
00:41:32,537 --> 00:41:34,835
and fifty other
imaginary friends

450
00:41:34,872 --> 00:41:36,339
Let's get out of here

451
00:41:36,374 --> 00:41:38,342
Let's draw a picture

452
00:41:38,376 --> 00:41:40,844
We can draw pictures all day

453
00:41:40,878 --> 00:41:42,004
There you go

454
00:41:42,046 --> 00:41:44,640
Clippety-clop, clippety-clop
lsn't that fun?

455
00:41:51,189 --> 00:41:52,918
l can't believe l found you

456
00:41:52,957 --> 00:41:54,424
What are you still doing here?

457
00:41:54,458 --> 00:41:56,289
l can't find Carlos

458
00:41:56,327 --> 00:41:58,124
and Spencer's wasted
at this old house

459
00:41:58,162 --> 00:42:00,756
We gotta get to them
before Freddy does

460
00:42:00,798 --> 00:42:02,231
-Who's Freddy?
-l'll tell you on the way

461
00:42:02,266 --> 00:42:03,358
Come on!

462
00:42:05,269 --> 00:42:06,429
God damn it!

463
00:42:17,014 --> 00:42:19,175
All right Once again

464
00:42:20,184 --> 00:42:21,617
This is your brain

465
00:42:24,155 --> 00:42:26,715
This is your brain

466
00:42:26,757 --> 00:42:28,748
on drugs

467
00:42:31,028 --> 00:42:32,188
Questions?

468
00:42:33,698 --> 00:42:36,462
Yeah! What are you on?

469
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:39,765
Looks like a frying pan
and some eggs to me

470
00:42:42,206 --> 00:42:43,798
Hey, Spence

471
00:42:43,841 --> 00:42:45,706
Let's trip out

472
00:42:54,185 --> 00:42:55,345
Cool

473
00:43:32,556 --> 00:43:33,955
Now he's gone!

474
00:43:34,792 --> 00:43:36,487
He must've fallen asleep

475
00:43:36,527 --> 00:43:38,495
You two look here and upstairs
l'm gonna look downstairs

476
00:43:38,529 --> 00:43:39,996
They're not here anymore

477
00:43:40,031 --> 00:43:43,023
Just humor me,
will you, please, and look?

478
00:43:46,904 --> 00:43:48,394
Where am l?

479
00:43:50,041 --> 00:43:51,599
Jump, boy

480
00:43:59,517 --> 00:44:01,212
-Dad?
-Be like me

481
00:44:03,354 --> 00:44:05,914
Father knows best

482
00:44:05,957 --> 00:44:07,549
Oh! Oh, stop!

483
00:44:12,830 --> 00:44:14,525
l'm not like you!

484
00:44:14,565 --> 00:44:16,123
l don't wanna be like you!

485
00:44:18,202 --> 00:44:21,296
Be like me

486
00:44:21,339 --> 00:44:24,001
Now l'm playin' with power!

487
00:44:27,845 --> 00:44:29,073
All right

488
00:44:30,348 --> 00:44:32,339
Super Spencer!

489
00:44:38,189 --> 00:44:40,214
Great graphics

490
00:44:53,371 --> 00:44:55,168
Whoa l'm here

491
00:45:06,984 --> 00:45:08,849

492
00:45:14,325 --> 00:45:16,122
OK, hold him down

493
00:45:17,495 --> 00:45:18,962
Oh, shit

494
00:45:20,498 --> 00:45:22,159
Hold on Hold on to him

495
00:45:22,199 --> 00:45:24,963
-What's happening to him?
-He's stuck in a nightmare

496
00:45:25,002 --> 00:45:26,196
And it's kicking
the shit out of him !

497
00:45:27,104 --> 00:45:29,129
-Wake him up
-He's too wasted

498
00:45:29,173 --> 00:45:31,698
-Spencer! Jesus
-lt's Freddy

499
00:45:33,778 --> 00:45:35,211
We've got to get him out

500
00:45:35,246 --> 00:45:36,804
l'll go into his dream

501
00:45:36,847 --> 00:45:39,338
l'll try and bring him out
before he gets killed

502
00:45:39,383 --> 00:45:40,543
That's crazy

503
00:45:43,354 --> 00:45:45,083
What do you call that, rational?

504
00:46:04,041 --> 00:46:06,373
Rightleft
Right, left, right, left Pow!

505
00:46:21,358 --> 00:46:22,256
He's getting trashed

506
00:46:22,293 --> 00:46:23,419
l have to go in

507
00:46:23,461 --> 00:46:24,723
What about Freddy?

508
00:46:25,563 --> 00:46:26,689
Freddy won't hurt me

509
00:46:26,730 --> 00:46:28,288
l'm family

510
00:46:28,332 --> 00:46:30,061
OK, so how are you gonna go in?

511
00:46:30,101 --> 00:46:31,762
Well

512
00:46:33,037 --> 00:46:34,368
you're gonna have to lay me out

513
00:46:35,339 --> 00:46:36,465
What? What is th--

514
00:46:36,507 --> 00:46:38,236
-Just fucking lay me out!
-Wait a second!

515
00:46:38,275 --> 00:46:42,006
-Doc told me a different way
-No time to talk! Just do it!

516
00:46:50,354 --> 00:46:53,221
Jesus Christ

517
00:46:59,964 --> 00:47:02,330
l told you l knew an easier way

518
00:47:02,366 --> 00:47:05,563
Concentration meditation
That's what Doc always says

519
00:47:06,971 --> 00:47:08,632
This place is incredible

520
00:47:11,375 --> 00:47:13,275
Pow! Bam ! Splat!

521
00:47:13,310 --> 00:47:14,470

522
00:47:16,313 --> 00:47:17,507
Jump, boy

523
00:47:18,816 --> 00:47:20,647
Ow! Stop!

524
00:47:20,684 --> 00:47:22,652
Oh, shit! Spencer!

525
00:47:27,324 --> 00:47:29,292
Come on, John! Let go of me!

526
00:47:31,028 --> 00:47:32,290
Get out of here! Now, Tracy!

527
00:47:32,329 --> 00:47:35,628
Hey, You forgot the power glove

528
00:47:38,202 --> 00:47:39,533
Pow!

529
00:47:40,571 --> 00:47:42,129
Boing, boing

530
00:47:55,319 --> 00:47:57,184
Be like me Be like me

531
00:48:13,437 --> 00:48:14,665
What do you know?

532
00:48:14,705 --> 00:48:16,935
l beat my high score

533
00:48:38,862 --> 00:48:41,797
Great to be back in business

534
00:48:41,832 --> 00:48:43,663
thanks to you

535
00:48:50,708 --> 00:48:54,109
Daddy's waiting for you,
little girl

536
00:48:54,144 --> 00:48:55,509
Shut the fuck up, man!

537
00:49:08,392 --> 00:49:10,587
Spencer's gone
l couldn't stop it

538
00:49:11,395 --> 00:49:12,862
John's still in there

539
00:49:12,896 --> 00:49:14,193
l couldn't wake him up

540
00:49:14,231 --> 00:49:16,756
Come on! Snap out of it!
What are we gonna do?

541
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:19,291
We're gonna pick him up
and get the hell out of here!

542
00:50:25,035 --> 00:50:26,662
Not again

543
00:50:26,704 --> 00:50:28,638
He's not gonna get me again

544
00:50:29,773 --> 00:50:32,037
Nothing is gonna
make me get off this bed

545
00:50:35,212 --> 00:50:36,873
Damn it!

546
00:50:41,819 --> 00:50:43,047
l hate this house

547
00:51:30,367 --> 00:51:31,834
Up here!

548
00:51:47,951 --> 00:51:49,384
l know why you let me go

549
00:51:51,555 --> 00:51:55,150
Do you think l'm your daddy?

550
00:51:58,228 --> 00:52:00,594
Wrong!

551
00:52:05,068 --> 00:52:07,036
But you let me live

552
00:52:07,070 --> 00:52:11,166
Only long enough for you
to bring me back my daughter

553
00:52:11,208 --> 00:52:12,368
Your daughter?

554
00:52:15,579 --> 00:52:16,841
And now

555
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:21,943
she's gonna take me
to a whole new playground

556
00:52:27,324 --> 00:52:30,725
Grounded!

557
00:52:52,082 --> 00:52:54,175
Oh, my God, Maggie!
What's going on?

558
00:52:55,219 --> 00:52:57,244
Come on, Maggie Let's go!

559
00:52:58,856 --> 00:53:00,187
Come--

560
00:53:00,224 --> 00:53:02,021
Let's get out of here!

561
00:53:02,059 --> 00:53:03,526
Let's get the hell out of here!

562
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:06,120
lt--it's not a boy

563
00:53:07,831 --> 00:53:09,321
lt's

564
00:53:11,668 --> 00:53:13,158
Come on!
We gotta get out of here!

565
00:53:13,203 --> 00:53:15,364
Now! Come on!

566
00:53:18,509 --> 00:53:19,669
Let's go!

567
00:53:29,686 --> 00:53:32,621
You forgot
where you came from, kid

568
00:53:33,624 --> 00:53:36,991
but l know where you're going

569
00:53:43,100 --> 00:53:45,034
lt's traveling time!

570
00:53:57,814 --> 00:53:59,975
What's wrong?
Maggie, get in the van!

571
00:54:00,017 --> 00:54:01,177
Come on!

572
00:54:03,020 --> 00:54:05,284
We gotta get the hell
out of here!

573
00:54:05,322 --> 00:54:06,619
Oh, God

574
00:54:06,657 --> 00:54:07,988
Let's go!

575
00:54:30,347 --> 00:54:31,814
Whatever happened

576
00:54:31,848 --> 00:54:33,748
it wasn't your fault

577
00:54:46,363 --> 00:54:47,853
Carlos, Tracy, and Spencer

578
00:54:47,898 --> 00:54:50,332
stowed away in the back
of the shelter van

579
00:54:50,367 --> 00:54:52,835
They were trying to escape
Can you believe it?

580
00:54:52,869 --> 00:54:55,838
So l took them to the phone
They were supposed to call you

581
00:54:55,872 --> 00:54:57,840
John Doe and l were gonna
check out the school

582
00:54:57,874 --> 00:54:59,739
But Tracy got separated

583
00:54:59,776 --> 00:55:01,209
And then they ran away

584
00:55:02,479 --> 00:55:03,776
What the hell
are you talking about?

585
00:55:03,814 --> 00:55:06,783
l'm talking about Carlos
and Spencer and the John Doe!

586
00:55:06,817 --> 00:55:08,808
Kelly, they just disappeared!

587
00:55:08,852 --> 00:55:10,444
Been handling
too many cases, Maggie

588
00:55:10,487 --> 00:55:11,954
Those kids were never here

589
00:55:13,490 --> 00:55:15,458
l would've remembered
any new arrivals

590
00:55:15,492 --> 00:55:17,585
Kelly, l'm talking about
forty-eight hours ago

591
00:55:17,628 --> 00:55:18,754
l brought you a John Doe

592
00:55:18,795 --> 00:55:20,057
Don't tell me
you don't remember that!

593
00:55:20,097 --> 00:55:21,860
You the one who's handling
too many cases!

594
00:55:21,898 --> 00:55:23,058
Get some rest, Maggie

595
00:55:26,870 --> 00:55:28,167
And then

596
00:55:29,172 --> 00:55:31,140
we got back and

597
00:55:31,174 --> 00:55:33,904
no one remembers John or Carlos

598
00:55:34,845 --> 00:55:38,008
lt's like they never existed

599
00:55:38,048 --> 00:55:39,811
l've been hearing strange shit

600
00:55:39,850 --> 00:55:43,342
Like some of the kids
are dreaming about Carlos

601
00:55:44,354 --> 00:55:45,787
And they don't even
remember him

602
00:55:49,926 --> 00:55:51,655
l remember him

603
00:55:51,695 --> 00:55:53,322
Why?

604
00:55:53,363 --> 00:55:55,331
Because l can control my dreams

605
00:55:55,365 --> 00:55:58,266
l'm not fooled
by this thing you saw

606
00:55:59,136 --> 00:56:00,262
Whatever he is

607
00:56:00,303 --> 00:56:03,397
he's fucking with the line
between dreams and reality

608
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:06,034
He didn't just kill Carlos
and the others

609
00:56:07,210 --> 00:56:08,370
He erased them

610
00:56:22,693 --> 00:56:23,853
lt's not a boy

611
00:56:52,622 --> 00:56:53,782
Mother!

612
00:57:17,914 --> 00:57:19,074
Shit

613
00:57:23,720 --> 00:57:25,244
You're getting ready
to kill somebody

614
00:57:25,288 --> 00:57:26,915
Defend myself

615
00:57:29,826 --> 00:57:31,521
lt's your mind he'll go for

616
00:57:34,064 --> 00:57:35,224
Your fear

617
00:57:37,167 --> 00:57:39,431
l knew it, l knew it, l knew it

618
00:57:43,273 --> 00:57:45,833
Maggie, what are you doing?

619
00:57:47,344 --> 00:57:48,538
Who are they?

620
00:57:49,346 --> 00:57:50,904
Let me have that

621
00:57:50,947 --> 00:57:53,313
-l have to know
-l don't know

622
00:57:53,350 --> 00:57:55,580
l don't know who they were
They wouldn't tell me

623
00:57:56,353 --> 00:57:58,844
They have rules
about no contact

624
00:58:00,524 --> 00:58:02,617
Oh, there's been contact

625
00:59:02,619 --> 00:59:04,086
Find me

626
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:05,280
Find Daddy

627
00:59:06,389 --> 00:59:07,447
You're it

628
00:59:09,659 --> 00:59:11,217
Come to Daddy

629
00:59:13,296 --> 00:59:15,628
l won't tell

630
00:59:15,665 --> 00:59:16,825
Oh, God

631
00:59:25,675 --> 00:59:27,438
Fred, please

632
00:59:27,477 --> 00:59:28,967
l won't tell

633
00:59:31,982 --> 00:59:34,041
We need to talk, Loretta

634
00:59:38,989 --> 00:59:40,547
Go inside, honey

635
00:59:42,125 --> 00:59:44,116
l won't tell

636
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:46,287
l told you never

637
00:59:46,329 --> 00:59:48,627
never to go in there

638
00:59:48,665 --> 00:59:50,565
l told you that! l told you

639
01:01:02,005 --> 01:01:04,235
Catherine

640
01:01:08,945 --> 01:01:12,142
You were such a little artist

641
01:01:12,182 --> 01:01:13,649
No, it can't be

642
01:01:15,352 --> 01:01:16,910
l know who l am

643
01:01:23,660 --> 01:01:26,322
You're my blood

644
01:01:26,363 --> 01:01:29,161
Only you could have
brought me out

645
01:01:29,199 --> 01:01:30,928
in your mind

646
01:01:30,967 --> 01:01:33,162
But you can't be my father

647
01:01:33,203 --> 01:01:35,398
They took you away from me

648
01:01:35,438 --> 01:01:38,771
but l made 'em pay!

649
01:01:38,808 --> 01:01:43,211
l took all their children
away from them

650
01:01:43,246 --> 01:01:44,474
and now

651
01:01:45,648 --> 01:01:47,206
that's over

652
01:01:49,152 --> 01:01:50,517
Come on

653
01:01:58,828 --> 01:02:00,295
The shelter

654
01:02:01,498 --> 01:02:06,094
Time to start all over again

655
01:02:06,136 --> 01:02:07,831
But this isn't Springwood!

656
01:02:15,178 --> 01:02:16,907
Every town

657
01:02:16,946 --> 01:02:19,107
has an Elm Street

658
01:02:55,785 --> 01:02:57,412
Tracy girl

659
01:02:58,388 --> 01:02:59,719
Daddy's home

660
01:03:01,091 --> 01:03:03,355
Daddyyou're dead

661
01:03:08,398 --> 01:03:09,922
l'm home, darling

662
01:03:20,610 --> 01:03:21,941
Come say hello

663
01:03:23,580 --> 01:03:25,275
l don't want to, Daddy

664
01:03:35,458 --> 01:03:38,450
Come on, give Daddy some honey

665
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:45,631
No one has to know

666
01:03:53,843 --> 01:03:55,174
You're not my daddy

667
01:03:57,947 --> 01:03:59,812
Come on, Tracy

668
01:04:07,290 --> 01:04:10,088
Here! Do you love me now?

669
01:04:15,298 --> 01:04:16,629
He's dead!

670
01:04:16,666 --> 01:04:18,429
My daddy's dead

671
01:04:25,608 --> 01:04:27,803
No honey for Daddy?

672
01:04:34,884 --> 01:04:37,409
What's with kids today, huh?

673
01:04:37,453 --> 01:04:39,353
No respect

674
01:04:39,389 --> 01:04:41,584
You can't scare me anymore

675
01:04:41,624 --> 01:04:44,252
Oh, you better speak up

676
01:04:44,294 --> 01:04:46,888
Must be my deaf ear

677
01:04:55,104 --> 01:04:57,971
Kung fu this, bitch

678
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:07,015
This is my dream,
and l do what l want

679
01:05:07,050 --> 01:05:09,109
Might be your dream

680
01:05:09,152 --> 01:05:11,916
but it's my rules!

681
01:05:32,942 --> 01:05:35,775
Doc--l need to talk to Doc!

682
01:05:37,413 --> 01:05:38,539
Come on!

683
01:06:18,388 --> 01:06:20,583
Doc? Doc, is that you?

684
01:06:20,623 --> 01:06:22,250
Yeah, Tracy Where are you?

685
01:06:22,292 --> 01:06:23,919
l'm over here
in one of the lockers

686
01:06:23,960 --> 01:06:25,222
You gotta get me out!

687
01:06:30,833 --> 01:06:32,027
Where the hell are you?

688
01:06:32,068 --> 01:06:33,330
Right here

689
01:06:37,407 --> 01:06:38,271
You taught her a lot

690
01:06:38,308 --> 01:06:42,438
but there's so much more
to learn

691
01:06:42,478 --> 01:06:44,810
How about this, Doc?

692
01:07:13,976 --> 01:07:18,208
Sticks and stones
may break my bones

693
01:07:19,082 --> 01:07:22,779
but nothing will ever kill me

694
01:07:23,619 --> 01:07:26,884
Well, let's see now

695
01:07:26,923 --> 01:07:29,983
First they tried burning me

696
01:07:32,061 --> 01:07:36,157
Then they tried burying me

697
01:07:42,372 --> 01:07:46,206
But this--this is my favorite

698
01:07:48,144 --> 01:07:51,443
They even tried holy water

699
01:07:55,952 --> 01:08:00,218
But l just keep on tickin'

700
01:08:01,391 --> 01:08:04,326
because they promised me that

701
01:08:04,360 --> 01:08:05,486
They?

702
01:08:05,528 --> 01:08:07,428
The dream people

703
01:08:07,463 --> 01:08:09,761
The ones that gave me this job

704
01:08:11,267 --> 01:08:12,757
ln dreams

705
01:08:13,603 --> 01:08:18,302
l am forever!

706
01:08:18,341 --> 01:08:20,070
Too bad you're not

707
01:08:40,163 --> 01:08:41,323
Thank God

708
01:08:43,499 --> 01:08:45,023
l think l've got a way
to get him

709
01:08:46,803 --> 01:08:48,327
So what's the plan, Doc?

710
01:08:50,673 --> 01:08:51,799
Thanks

711
01:08:51,841 --> 01:08:53,206
You can't get him
in the dream

712
01:08:54,043 --> 01:08:57,171
but if this can come out,
he can come out

713
01:08:57,213 --> 01:08:59,841
And if he can come out,
he can bleed

714
01:08:59,882 --> 01:09:01,611
-And die
-Right

715
01:09:01,651 --> 01:09:03,175
How will you know
when l got him?

716
01:09:03,219 --> 01:09:04,914
l'm gonna find you with this

717
01:09:04,954 --> 01:09:06,421
and then l'm bringing you out

718
01:09:06,456 --> 01:09:08,720
You've got to be holding him
to carry him out

719
01:09:08,758 --> 01:09:10,282
l know

720
01:09:10,326 --> 01:09:12,123
He's gonna try and trick you
just like Tracy

721
01:09:12,829 --> 01:09:14,956
He'll try to use your eyes
to fool you

722
01:09:14,997 --> 01:09:16,624
You'll use these

723
01:09:16,666 --> 01:09:17,963
Get the hell outta here

724
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:19,490
You want to live?

725
01:09:19,535 --> 01:09:21,662
These mean nothing here

726
01:09:21,704 --> 01:09:23,968
but in a dream,
they can be anything you want

727
01:09:24,006 --> 01:09:27,032
He got inside your head
You get inside of his

728
01:09:28,277 --> 01:09:29,539
That's my job, isn't it?

729
01:09:29,579 --> 01:09:32,605
Be careful He's good at
finding out what hurts the most

730
01:09:32,648 --> 01:09:33,774
Exactly

731
01:09:33,816 --> 01:09:36,512
That's why you gotta take me
with you

732
01:09:36,552 --> 01:09:37,883
l can't

733
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:41,083
lt's gotta be me and him

734
01:09:43,826 --> 01:09:45,088
All right, Doc

735
01:09:46,195 --> 01:09:47,355
Put me in

736
01:09:52,435 --> 01:09:53,595
Strap her in

737
01:09:56,939 --> 01:09:58,236
Take a deep breath

738
01:09:59,742 --> 01:10:01,175
Good

739
01:10:02,011 --> 01:10:03,171
Ten

740
01:10:04,013 --> 01:10:05,378
nine

741
01:10:06,082 --> 01:10:07,549
eight

742
01:10:07,583 --> 01:10:08,880
seven

743
01:10:08,918 --> 01:10:10,545
six

744
01:10:10,586 --> 01:10:11,917
five

745
01:10:11,954 --> 01:10:13,615
four

746
01:10:13,656 --> 01:10:14,918
three

747
01:10:14,957 --> 01:10:16,117
two

748
01:10:17,159 --> 01:10:18,319
one

749
01:11:17,214 --> 01:11:19,648
Get inside his brain

750
01:13:18,601 --> 01:13:20,330
l'm in his memories

751
01:13:31,014 --> 01:13:33,380
Son of a hundred maniacs

752
01:14:11,488 --> 01:14:13,479
You ready for it, boy?

753
01:14:14,891 --> 01:14:18,486
You been a waste
since the day l took you in

754
01:14:18,528 --> 01:14:21,258
Now it's time
to take your medicine

755
01:14:27,070 --> 01:14:28,503
Thank you, sir

756
01:14:30,473 --> 01:14:31,997
May l have another?

757
01:14:37,180 --> 01:14:39,148
You want to know
the secret of pain?

758
01:14:39,916 --> 01:14:42,612
lf you just stop feeling it

759
01:14:42,652 --> 01:14:43,846
you can start using it

760
01:14:50,427 --> 01:14:51,587
Child killer!

761
01:15:11,748 --> 01:15:13,648
We know what you want

762
01:15:13,683 --> 01:15:15,378
l want it all!

763
01:15:15,418 --> 01:15:16,749
Of course you do

764
01:15:16,786 --> 01:15:17,912
Then open up

765
01:15:17,954 --> 01:15:21,287
And you shall be forever!

766
01:15:48,852 --> 01:15:50,285
Mommy!

767
01:16:00,296 --> 01:16:02,321
Don't worry, baby

768
01:16:02,365 --> 01:16:04,765
Mommy just had
to take her medicine

769
01:16:04,801 --> 01:16:07,065
for snooping
in Daddy's special work

770
01:16:09,739 --> 01:16:12,503
But you won't tell, will you?

771
01:16:13,309 --> 01:16:14,799
l won't tell

772
01:16:26,022 --> 01:16:28,650
But you did tell, didn't you?

773
01:16:29,993 --> 01:16:33,929
And now it's time
to take your medicine

774
01:16:39,369 --> 01:16:40,700
You killed my mother!

775
01:16:46,576 --> 01:16:47,736
She's got him !

776
01:16:48,811 --> 01:16:50,142
Let's get her out of there

777
01:17:13,002 --> 01:17:14,230
l've got you!

778
01:17:21,811 --> 01:17:22,971
l had him !

779
01:17:23,880 --> 01:17:25,404
Where the hell is he?

780
01:17:28,051 --> 01:17:29,313
Maybe the trip killed him

781
01:17:29,352 --> 01:17:31,513
Nobecause
l'm still seeing things

782
01:17:32,188 --> 01:17:34,213
the way l did in my dream

783
01:17:34,257 --> 01:17:35,019
lt's not over Let's go

784
01:17:46,202 --> 01:17:47,897
The cops were supposed
to pick this stuff up

785
01:17:47,937 --> 01:17:49,063
l'm glad they didn't

786
01:17:49,105 --> 01:17:50,936
We'll have to hit him
with everything we've got

787
01:17:55,144 --> 01:17:57,476
Check out this knife

788
01:17:57,513 --> 01:17:59,310
-Hey, put that away
-That's too small

789
01:18:05,421 --> 01:18:07,082
Guess so

790
01:18:07,123 --> 01:18:08,283
You sure that's big enough?

791
01:18:10,059 --> 01:18:11,583
Still believe
he's gonna show up, huh?

792
01:18:12,695 --> 01:18:13,957
Come on, Tracy Over here

793
01:18:16,566 --> 01:18:18,033
l can feel it

794
01:18:49,932 --> 01:18:51,559
You're real here

795
01:18:51,601 --> 01:18:53,398
lt wasn't my fault

796
01:18:54,137 --> 01:18:55,297
lt wasn't

797
01:18:56,339 --> 01:18:59,672
You saw what they did to me
when l was a kid

798
01:18:59,709 --> 01:19:01,006
You saw

799
01:19:02,779 --> 01:19:04,371
l loved you

800
01:19:06,015 --> 01:19:07,778
And your mother

801
01:19:07,817 --> 01:19:10,615
l tried so hard to be good

802
01:19:12,088 --> 01:19:13,419
l know, Daddy

803
01:19:14,390 --> 01:19:16,290
But when they took you
from me

804
01:19:16,993 --> 01:19:18,119
it wasn't right

805
01:19:18,161 --> 01:19:20,686
Oh, l knew you'd believe me

806
01:19:22,298 --> 01:19:23,458
Come to Daddy

807
01:19:38,648 --> 01:19:39,979
Over here!

808
01:19:40,950 --> 01:19:42,440
l'm OK

809
01:19:43,219 --> 01:19:44,481
Maggie, watch out!

810
01:19:51,027 --> 01:19:52,961
-Where's the key?
-l don't know!

811
01:19:54,230 --> 01:19:55,424
The lock's jammed!

812
01:19:55,465 --> 01:19:57,433
l didn't need a glove

813
01:19:57,467 --> 01:19:59,526
to kill your bitch
of a mother

814
01:19:59,569 --> 01:20:03,232
and l don't need one now!

815
01:20:11,714 --> 01:20:13,614
Come on

816
01:20:13,649 --> 01:20:14,980
Let go

817
01:20:21,924 --> 01:20:23,357
l'll show you how

818
01:20:30,233 --> 01:20:31,791
Like you showed my mother?

819
01:20:31,834 --> 01:20:33,062
And Carlos?

820
01:20:34,937 --> 01:20:36,097
And Spencer?

821
01:20:37,774 --> 01:20:40,072
Give Daddy the glove back,
princess

822
01:20:40,109 --> 01:20:41,269
Never!

823
01:20:43,412 --> 01:20:44,572
Give it to me!

824
01:20:47,450 --> 01:20:49,042
Gimme the glove!

825
01:20:52,555 --> 01:20:54,614
ln your dreams!

826
01:21:11,240 --> 01:21:14,869
Oh, Daddy, l remember when we
used to hold hands together

827
01:21:14,911 --> 01:21:16,845
when l was a kid

828
01:21:16,879 --> 01:21:18,039
