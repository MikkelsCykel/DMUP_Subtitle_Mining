1
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:06,664
What the hell happened to you?

2
00:00:06,836 --> 00:00:08,497
Vitti threw me off a roof.

3
00:00:09,372 --> 00:00:12,032
Vitti? You talked to Vitti?

4
00:00:12,207 --> 00:00:13,538
Yeah, I talked to Vitti.

5
00:00:13,709 --> 00:00:16,439
- What did you say to him?
- Nothing.

6
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,843
- You sure you didn't tell him anything?
- I didn't say anything, Mr. Rigazzi.

7
00:00:22,017 --> 00:00:24,678
Can I go now? I think my leg's broken.

8
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,289
That must hurt, huh?
Wait a minute.

9
00:00:28,457 --> 00:00:30,549
I have something for that.

10
00:00:37,732 --> 00:00:40,293
I hate to see people in pain.

11
00:00:40,468 --> 00:00:42,265
Get him out of here.

12
00:00:43,705 --> 00:00:45,263
What about Vitti?

13
00:00:45,441 --> 00:00:47,772
He's a hard man to kill.

14
00:00:48,243 --> 00:00:50,336
But he's not immortal.

15
00:00:51,212 --> 00:00:53,113
Our time will come.

16
00:00:53,281 --> 00:00:54,874
- Okay, roll film.
- Background.

17
00:01:03,625 --> 00:01:06,287
Hey, I like my sausage burnt.

18
00:01:06,461 --> 00:01:10,157
I don't know how you like your sausage?
I been doing this 20 fucking years.

19
00:01:10,332 --> 00:01:13,198
- You got the money?
- I almost got it.

20
00:01:13,368 --> 00:01:17,771
I'm still light 15 large.
But don't worry about it, I got it covered.

21
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:18,928
All I gotta...

22
00:01:19,107 --> 00:01:20,439
All I gotta...

23
00:01:21,109 --> 00:01:24,841
Cut! Cut! Can you do something
about the goddamn smoke?

24
00:01:25,013 --> 00:01:26,640
Cut!

25
00:01:26,816 --> 00:01:31,809
Can you do something
about the damn smoke?

26
00:01:31,986 --> 00:01:34,477
This is the trouble
with shooting on location...

27
00:01:34,656 --> 00:01:38,649
...although it's worth it
for the authenticity.

28
00:01:38,827 --> 00:01:40,818
Well, it looks authentic.

29
00:01:40,995 --> 00:01:42,486
Hey, Tony!

30
00:01:42,664 --> 00:01:43,654
Tony.

31
00:01:43,832 --> 00:01:46,300
Anthony Bella, Nicky Caesar.

32
00:01:47,569 --> 00:01:50,596
- This is Paul Vitti.
- You don't have to tell me who he is.

33
00:01:50,772 --> 00:01:53,502
- It's a pleasure to meet you, mate.
- Hey, mate.

34
00:01:53,675 --> 00:01:56,008
I don't believe this. An English guy.

35
00:01:56,178 --> 00:01:58,805
- You ain't even Italian.
- Australian-ltalian.

36
00:01:58,981 --> 00:02:02,848
- There's a lot of paisans down under.
- Down under what?

37
00:02:10,024 --> 00:02:13,654
- You like to laugh, don't you?
- It's a nervous defense mechanism.

38
00:02:13,828 --> 00:02:16,854
I don't have to do it if it bothers you.
So I'll just...

39
00:02:17,031 --> 00:02:18,794
So, Paul, are you gonna join us?

40
00:02:19,434 --> 00:02:21,868
I'm thinking I might.
I like the whole setup here.

41
00:02:22,037 --> 00:02:26,200
Sensational, mate. I can't wait to work
with you. I got a lot of questions for you.

42
00:02:26,375 --> 00:02:28,171
- All right, mate.
- All right.

43
00:02:28,343 --> 00:02:30,904
- Can we get this fucking shot?
- Yes, yes.

44
00:02:31,079 --> 00:02:34,981
Paul, thank you. And welcome.

45
00:02:35,149 --> 00:02:37,084
Welcome aboard.

46
00:02:37,252 --> 00:02:38,720
Couple of things.

47
00:02:38,887 --> 00:02:41,378
I don't know who makes these decisions...

48
00:02:41,557 --> 00:02:44,151
...but there are things that
l see that don't look right.

49
00:02:44,325 --> 00:02:47,488
Yes, I sensed this myself.

50
00:02:47,662 --> 00:02:50,222
Which elements strike you as wrong?

51
00:02:50,399 --> 00:02:53,664
Well, the people, mainly. I mean,
you got a boss who speaks Australian.

52
00:02:53,836 --> 00:02:56,930
- What the fuck is that about?
- Not my first choice.

53
00:02:57,673 --> 00:03:00,836
- And your background is what?
- Theater, mostly.

54
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:03,910
That figures. I got some people
l could bring around...

55
00:03:04,078 --> 00:03:06,774
...that will add a certain authenticity
to the whole thing.

56
00:03:06,948 --> 00:03:10,281
I would be eternally grateful
to you if you could.

57
00:03:10,452 --> 00:03:13,421
Is there anything else that you would need?

58
00:03:14,155 --> 00:03:16,453
I'd like one of those trailers
like the stars got.

59
00:03:16,625 --> 00:03:21,061
Done! Done! I am gonna go
put that in the works right now.

60
00:03:21,229 --> 00:03:23,060
Right.

61
00:03:23,231 --> 00:03:25,290
Brian!

62
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,936
- Hey, Paul. You really gonna do this?
- Yeah, I'm really gonna do this.

63
00:03:30,104 --> 00:03:34,040
Are you out of your fucking mind?
I'm going nuts already with this job thing.

64
00:03:34,209 --> 00:03:36,870
In a week, I'll fucking kill
this Raoul or I'll kill myself.

65
00:03:37,046 --> 00:03:41,745
This is just a good cover till I figure out
what I'm gonna do. But call the guys.

66
00:04:07,575 --> 00:04:10,703
- You know, there's a line here.
- Yeah, it's in back of me.

67
00:04:10,878 --> 00:04:12,936
Take the chicken and the two pastas.

68
00:04:13,115 --> 00:04:15,981
You must be a teamster.
Youse don't stop eating.

69
00:04:22,156 --> 00:04:25,490
"Tell me why I'd give a shit
about your wife's cousin?"

70
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:29,457
- No, no good.
- It's not good?

71
00:04:33,568 --> 00:04:38,232
What about this line? "Stevie Wonder
sees more shit than you do!"

72
00:04:38,406 --> 00:04:40,841
- No. Never.
- It's not good?

73
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:41,999
Never.

74
00:04:50,318 --> 00:04:53,549
"How much does the chosen snitch
want for this?"

75
00:04:55,424 --> 00:04:56,412
- No?
- No.

76
00:04:56,591 --> 00:04:57,819
- It's no good.
- No good.

77
00:04:57,992 --> 00:04:59,620
Jesus.

78
00:05:00,361 --> 00:05:04,195
That's it. That's...
That's the end of the scene.

79
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:09,657
- There's no dialogue in the scene.
- You're better off.

80
00:05:23,218 --> 00:05:25,185
Get in the car.

81
00:05:25,953 --> 00:05:28,354
- We going to the prom?
- Shut up and get in the car.

82
00:05:28,524 --> 00:05:30,116
I know.

83
00:05:36,597 --> 00:05:38,327
Sit down.

84
00:05:39,001 --> 00:05:40,662
Careful. The eggs are on the bottom.

85
00:05:40,836 --> 00:05:42,736
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

86
00:05:48,609 --> 00:05:51,544
You the shrink taking care of Paul Vitti?

87
00:05:51,713 --> 00:05:53,943
- Yes, I am.
- So is he nuts, or what?

88
00:05:54,515 --> 00:05:57,178
I'm sorry, I don't discuss
my patients' cases with anyone.

89
00:05:57,352 --> 00:05:58,579
Discuss it.

90
00:05:58,753 --> 00:06:03,053
He's suffering from a chronic anxiety,
and...

91
00:06:03,224 --> 00:06:05,089
And what?

92
00:06:05,394 --> 00:06:08,794
Antisocial personality disorder.

93
00:06:08,963 --> 00:06:10,260
Sociopathy.

94
00:06:10,432 --> 00:06:13,457
I'm getting a fucking headache here.
What are you trying to say?

95
00:06:14,203 --> 00:06:16,032
He has a criminal temperament.

96
00:06:17,705 --> 00:06:19,970
He's a criminal?

97
00:06:20,709 --> 00:06:23,370
This is news?

98
00:06:23,544 --> 00:06:26,241
And for that you need a doctor degree?

99
00:06:27,515 --> 00:06:28,607
What do you do for him?

100
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:32,383
I try to get him to see
the possibility of change.

101
00:06:32,553 --> 00:06:34,180
Wrong.

102
00:06:34,356 --> 00:06:37,450
You do not want him to change.

103
00:06:38,861 --> 00:06:40,794
That's Mrs. LoPresti.

104
00:06:40,962 --> 00:06:42,122
Patti.

105
00:06:42,296 --> 00:06:45,128
Patti, I'm Ben Sobel.

106
00:06:46,001 --> 00:06:48,695
Paul Vitti is very important to this family.

107
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:51,338
We don't want to see you
turning him into a stromboni.

108
00:06:51,874 --> 00:06:55,707
Stromboni? The thing they clean
the ice with at the hockey games?

109
00:06:55,877 --> 00:06:58,936
That's a Zamboni, asshole. Stromboni.

110
00:06:59,113 --> 00:07:01,241
It's a bull with his balls cut off.

111
00:07:05,654 --> 00:07:09,111
- No, we don't want to see that happen.
- Not unless you want to be one too.

112
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:12,385
No, I'm very attached to my balls.

113
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,051
As you can probably tell.

114
00:07:19,099 --> 00:07:21,694
Then do the right thing. Understand?

115
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:24,361
Yes. Yes, I do.

116
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:29,971
Goodbye.

117
00:07:34,282 --> 00:07:36,477
No hard feelings.

118
00:07:36,651 --> 00:07:40,645
No, and probably never again.

119
00:07:42,124 --> 00:07:46,526
We're gonna need a grapple or a crane.
Fifty-foot boom, at least.

120
00:07:46,694 --> 00:07:49,492
I seen one in Bayonne, but I'll call around.

121
00:07:49,664 --> 00:07:51,097
All right, see what you can do.

122
00:07:51,265 --> 00:07:54,200
And we're gonna need a city bus.
Anybody got ideas about that?

123
00:07:54,368 --> 00:07:57,736
I got a guy in the Transit Authority.
He owes me big.

124
00:07:57,905 --> 00:08:01,341
- Let me know when you want me to call.
- Hello, Paul.

125
00:08:02,877 --> 00:08:05,107
- Hey. How you doing?
- Hi, guys. How are you?

126
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,680
- Patti, how you doing?
- Good. I guess everyone's gone Hollywood.

127
00:08:08,849 --> 00:08:11,751
Excuse me. This is a closed set.
We're about to start shooting.

128
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:15,377
Yeah? So am I. Let's walk. Come on.

129
00:08:15,557 --> 00:08:19,653
- I heard you had some more trouble.
- Yeah, Lou the Wrench took a shot at me.

130
00:08:19,828 --> 00:08:23,593
I don't have to tell you, Paul. Alone on
the streets, you don't stand a chance.

131
00:08:23,765 --> 00:08:25,664
That's what the family is all about.

132
00:08:25,834 --> 00:08:28,428
Since the old days when
the grandfathers first came over.

133
00:08:28,604 --> 00:08:30,434
It's not something you walk away from.

134
00:08:30,606 --> 00:08:32,800
When you're a Jet,
you're a Jet all the way.

135
00:08:32,974 --> 00:08:35,636
- What?
- Nothing.

136
00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:37,539
So you wanna tell me what's going on?

137
00:08:37,712 --> 00:08:39,805
I see you have your whole crew
back together.

138
00:08:39,982 --> 00:08:41,950
Nothing's going on. They're actors now.

139
00:08:42,116 --> 00:08:43,549
Don't bullshit me, Paul.

140
00:08:43,718 --> 00:08:46,551
I know you're planning something,
and I'm feeling left out.

141
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:52,419
All right. All right, I'll tell you.
Something's going down.

142
00:08:53,428 --> 00:08:54,793
You'll get your end.

143
00:08:54,963 --> 00:08:57,454
Just let us do what we gotta do.
It'll be fine.

144
00:08:57,633 --> 00:08:59,294
Okay?

145
00:08:59,734 --> 00:09:02,966
You're a good friend. I would never
insist on something like this...

146
00:09:03,137 --> 00:09:06,539
...but I'd feel better if you'd bring Eddie
and a couple of my guys in...

147
00:09:06,707 --> 00:09:08,471
...you know, to help you with the job.

148
00:09:08,644 --> 00:09:09,872
Eddie "Yeah, what?"

149
00:09:10,044 --> 00:09:12,104
- He's a good man.
- He's a fucking jerk-off.

150
00:09:12,281 --> 00:09:14,249
He's young. He's got a lot to learn.

151
00:09:14,415 --> 00:09:17,907
What is this, crime school?
This is a serious thing we're doing here.

152
00:09:18,086 --> 00:09:20,953
Check him out. Talk to Frankie Brush.
Talk to Jackie the Jew.

153
00:09:21,122 --> 00:09:23,990
He's worked jobs with them before.
They'll vouch for him.

154
00:09:24,157 --> 00:09:25,785
Paul, please. For me.

155
00:09:25,961 --> 00:09:30,091
He does what I tell him, stays out of the
way, and he keeps his fucking mouth shut.

156
00:09:30,265 --> 00:09:33,495
All right. Fine. Thanks, Paul.
I really appreciate this.

157
00:09:33,669 --> 00:09:36,899
Oh, God. Dear God.

158
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:39,267
Look, sweetheart...

159
00:09:39,441 --> 00:09:41,704
Sweetheart, first of all...

160
00:09:41,877 --> 00:09:45,243
...we're not shooting the hooker scene
until tomorrow.

161
00:09:45,414 --> 00:09:51,649
And the hair, please, what is it?
Something from the cliche store?

162
00:09:51,819 --> 00:09:54,448
Raoul. This is a friend of mine.

163
00:09:54,622 --> 00:09:57,854
Patti. This is Patti Lo. This is Raoul.

164
00:09:58,026 --> 00:10:00,084
Patti Lo...?

165
00:10:00,762 --> 00:10:03,229
Patti LoPresti?

166
00:10:03,397 --> 00:10:07,128
I am so very, very sorry.

167
00:10:07,736 --> 00:10:11,365
How dare you not inform me
that Mrs. LoPresti is on the set today!

168
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:15,067
You are fired! Get out!

169
00:10:15,711 --> 00:10:19,544
That is why I'm...
Please, enjoy your visit with us.

170
00:10:19,714 --> 00:10:22,512
And if there is anything at all
that I can do...

171
00:10:22,684 --> 00:10:24,310
Go fuck yourself.

172
00:10:24,486 --> 00:10:28,285
Immediately. Immediately.

173
00:10:29,358 --> 00:10:31,348
He's from the theater.

174
00:10:46,108 --> 00:10:50,771
- Should I wait here, Mr. Rigazzi?
- No, pull the car up your ass and wait there.

175
00:11:05,794 --> 00:11:07,488
Get over your hurt feelings, okay?

176
00:11:07,662 --> 00:11:10,358
Tell me. Was she angry?
Am I in danger?

177
00:11:10,531 --> 00:11:15,127
Don't worry about it. I just wouldn't start
my car for a couple of weeks if I were you.

178
00:11:15,303 --> 00:11:17,203
I'll have Brian do it. He's new.

179
00:11:17,372 --> 00:11:19,032
Hey, Paul.

180
00:11:19,307 --> 00:11:20,705
Hey, Lou.

181
00:11:20,876 --> 00:11:23,367
This is Lou Rigazzi, Lou the Wrench.

182
00:11:24,178 --> 00:11:25,703
The Wrench?

183
00:11:26,348 --> 00:11:27,814
Brian? Sorry.

184
00:11:27,983 --> 00:11:29,211
Start my car!

185
00:11:29,383 --> 00:11:30,680
Now!

186
00:11:30,852 --> 00:11:32,819
Come on, I wanna talk to you.

187
00:11:32,988 --> 00:11:35,923
The guy who shot at you,
he was acting on his own.

188
00:11:36,091 --> 00:11:38,149
- I never gave the order.
- Yeah?

189
00:11:38,325 --> 00:11:41,089
He's been taken care of.
There won't be another incident.

190
00:11:41,262 --> 00:11:43,992
Unless you're thinking
of working for Patti Lo.

191
00:11:44,165 --> 00:11:45,359
Me? No.

192
00:11:45,532 --> 00:11:48,229
Good. Then I got no beef with you.

193
00:11:48,403 --> 00:11:49,892
Good, I can sleep better.

194
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:53,131
Let me tell you,
because that's not the way to go.

195
00:11:53,308 --> 00:11:56,573
You wanna back a winner,
which is gonna be me, okay?

196
00:11:56,745 --> 00:11:58,575
It only makes sense.

197
00:11:58,747 --> 00:12:01,772
So you come work for me.
I'll treat you right.

198
00:12:02,349 --> 00:12:03,714
No, thanks.

199
00:12:05,352 --> 00:12:07,116
So much for sleeping better.

200
00:12:08,589 --> 00:12:10,454
You be careful.

201
00:12:13,428 --> 00:12:16,157
Listen, Jelly, you just pick numbers.

202
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:18,820
- You know why? It's an open race.
- Jelly.

203
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,662
- Hey, doc! How you doing?
- How you doing?

204
00:12:21,837 --> 00:12:23,270
How are you?
How are you, Yo-Yo?

205
00:12:23,436 --> 00:12:24,530
Mo-Mo.

206
00:12:24,705 --> 00:12:27,675
Mo-Mo, right. I was thinking of the cellist.

207
00:12:27,843 --> 00:12:29,537
Jelly, where's Paul?

208
00:12:29,711 --> 00:12:31,575
He's in his camper.

209
00:12:32,948 --> 00:12:34,608
Yeah.

210
00:12:35,584 --> 00:12:37,108
Doc, what are you doing here?

211
00:12:37,285 --> 00:12:39,651
What am I doing here?
What are you doing here?

212
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:43,780
I came to tell you that you had a meeting
with your parole officer, and who do I see?

213
00:12:43,959 --> 00:12:45,153
Patti LoPresti!

214
00:12:45,861 --> 00:12:46,849
Patti who?

215
00:12:47,028 --> 00:12:49,087
Stop lying to me. Your whole gang is here.

216
00:12:49,263 --> 00:12:53,223
Who says I'm lying? I finally get a straight
job, I start getting my life together...

217
00:12:53,401 --> 00:12:56,426
...and you start accusing me?
That's how much you trust me?

218
00:12:56,604 --> 00:13:00,540
Paul, it's not that I don't trust you.
It's just that I don't trust you.

219
00:13:00,709 --> 00:13:02,540
This is what's so hard
about being an ex-con.

220
00:13:02,711 --> 00:13:05,202
You make one mistake
and nobody lets you forget it.

221
00:13:05,378 --> 00:13:08,213
So now you're the victim?
Paul, I want the truth.

222
00:13:08,383 --> 00:13:10,010
Wait a second.

223
00:13:10,185 --> 00:13:11,617
- Say that again.
- Say what?

224
00:13:11,785 --> 00:13:14,276
- What you just said. "I want the truth."
- I want the truth.

225
00:13:14,455 --> 00:13:17,015
- No, strong, like before.
- Paul, I want the truth!

226
00:13:17,192 --> 00:13:18,682
That's it. That's good.

227
00:13:18,859 --> 00:13:20,691
- What?
- I'm serious, that had power.

228
00:13:20,861 --> 00:13:24,194
- I believed you. You could be an actor.
- Paul, I am not an actor.

229
00:13:24,366 --> 00:13:26,128
You're better than the bums here.

230
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:29,497
- There's this part you could do.
- I can't. We have this meeting.

231
00:13:29,671 --> 00:13:33,367
We're shooting now. There's this part,
you could do it. I'm telling you, it's you.

232
00:13:33,808 --> 00:13:36,971
I did do Music Man in high school.
People thought I was quite good.

233
00:13:37,145 --> 00:13:39,477
Jelly, what are you...?

234
00:13:39,647 --> 00:13:41,945
Help! Help!

235
00:13:42,117 --> 00:13:43,878
Hey, help me!

236
00:13:44,051 --> 00:13:46,043
I don't wanna do this!

237
00:13:46,221 --> 00:13:50,885
- Does that screaming sound real to you?
- Yeah, that sounds pretty real to me.

238
00:13:51,293 --> 00:13:55,559
That was not funny at all. There was
no harness. They could've dropped me.

239
00:13:55,964 --> 00:13:57,761
If you didn't wanna do it,
you should've said.

240
00:13:57,933 --> 00:14:01,265
You said a scene on the roof.
I didn't know they would throw me off.

241
00:14:01,435 --> 00:14:04,462
They didn't throw you off.
They hung you over the side. That's it.

242
00:14:04,638 --> 00:14:07,767
I know what you're doing.
You're upset that I have custody of you...

243
00:14:07,943 --> 00:14:10,604
...so you passive-aggressively
make me look like a fool.

244
00:14:10,779 --> 00:14:14,236
Come on. You were great.
You were great.

245
00:14:14,415 --> 00:14:16,747
Second take, I thought,
was better than the first.

246
00:14:16,918 --> 00:14:19,318
Jelly wasn't giving me much, honestly.
So I...

247
00:14:20,655 --> 00:14:25,091
Screw you, Paul.
Oh, boy. Oh, boy. That's it. Okay.

248
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:27,558
- What are you doing, self-medicating again?
- No.

249
00:14:27,729 --> 00:14:30,128
Don't give me that decongestant,
multivitamin shit.

250
00:14:30,298 --> 00:14:33,631
- Come on, what are you doing?
- Ginkgo biloba. Helps my memory...

251
00:14:33,801 --> 00:14:36,703
...and I forget what else.
But don't worry about me.

252
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:39,361
Worry about what you're gonna say
to this parole officer.

253
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:42,442
I mean, what are you gonna tell him?
That you left my house?

254
00:14:42,611 --> 00:14:46,377
That you got your gang back together?
And for what? A high-school dropout reunion?

255
00:14:46,548 --> 00:14:48,878
- You recognize that car?
- Which car?

256
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:51,517
The one that's been following us
for the last few miles.

257
00:14:51,685 --> 00:14:55,952
That? Oh, yeah. I know that car. That's a
Mercedes S500. That is one sweet machine.

258
00:14:56,124 --> 00:14:58,455
It's an eight bore.
It comes in a 12, which is a beast.

259
00:14:58,627 --> 00:14:59,616
- Lose them.
- What?

260
00:14:59,794 --> 00:15:00,782
- Lose them.
- What?

261
00:15:00,962 --> 00:15:02,953
- Lose them!
- Lose that car? You can't...

262
00:15:10,872 --> 00:15:13,568
I'm gonna stop, Paul.
This could be the FBI.

263
00:15:13,742 --> 00:15:16,575
The FBl is two cars back.
You gotta be more observant. Left.

264
00:15:23,117 --> 00:15:25,017
I'm pulling over.
They won't shoot us. It's daylight.

265
00:15:25,185 --> 00:15:28,019
Broad daylight is the best time.
They can see better. Right!

266
00:15:55,149 --> 00:15:58,175
We gotta stop. This is a lease.

267
00:15:59,053 --> 00:16:00,453
Hey, it's a goddamn lease!

268
00:16:01,089 --> 00:16:03,079
- Move over. I'll drive.
- Move over where?

269
00:16:03,258 --> 00:16:05,385
- Get in the back seat. Back seat!
- Damn seat belt.

270
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,686
Get over!

271
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:19,031
- Buckle up, doc.
- It's gonna get worse?

272
00:16:19,207 --> 00:16:21,368
It ain't gonna get better.

273
00:16:29,017 --> 00:16:30,279
Stop it!

274
00:16:57,011 --> 00:16:58,410
Oh, my God.

275
00:16:58,580 --> 00:16:59,841
You think they'll get out?

276
00:17:00,013 --> 00:17:04,348
Yeah, that's James Bond and that
Sea Hunt guy, so they got a good shot.

277
00:17:06,053 --> 00:17:09,387
- I feel bad. Where are you going?
- I gotta take care of this.

278
00:17:09,557 --> 00:17:12,151
- Paul, your parole officer...
- Send him my regards.

279
00:17:12,327 --> 00:17:15,626
- Paul, I'm warning you. If you leave now...
- So long, doc.

280
00:17:15,796 --> 00:17:20,290
That's it. You're on your own now, pal.
That's it. I'm done.

281
00:17:20,468 --> 00:17:22,095
I'm...

282
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:23,258
...screwed.

283
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:39,111
So where is he, doctor?

284
00:17:39,287 --> 00:17:40,515
I wish I knew.

285
00:17:40,687 --> 00:17:46,216
Considering I released him into your custody,
that's not quite the answer I was looking for.

286
00:17:47,629 --> 00:17:50,530
He's got something in the works.
Care to tell me what you know?

287
00:17:50,698 --> 00:17:52,529
I don't know anything.

288
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:55,133
I really feel he's making
an effort to go straight.

289
00:17:55,303 --> 00:17:56,292
- Oh, yeah?
- Yes.

290
00:17:56,471 --> 00:17:59,668
That's why we got two corpses
in the bottom of the river?

291
00:18:00,442 --> 00:18:01,738
Here.

292
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:03,707
Vitti with Sal Masiello.

293
00:18:03,878 --> 00:18:06,779
Vitti with Patti LoPresti.
Vitti with Eddie DeVol.

294
00:18:06,948 --> 00:18:09,542
Let me know.
I can order you some wallet-size.

295
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:13,910
I am giving you 24 hours
to find him and deliver him to me.

296
00:18:14,088 --> 00:18:18,388
Otherwise, you're looking at obstruction
of justice and accessory to manslaughter.

297
00:18:21,329 --> 00:18:23,593
- Can I go?
- Sure, but you can't take your car.

298
00:18:23,765 --> 00:18:25,926
We're impounding it as evidence.

299
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:29,558
- Can I get a ride?
- Have a nice day.

300
00:18:32,372 --> 00:18:33,965
I don't got a lot of time.

301
00:18:34,142 --> 00:18:38,010
They're probably gonna come looking for me,
so we'll go over everything at the club.

302
00:18:38,178 --> 00:18:43,310
Paul, not that I'm questioning or anything,
but what do we need with this Eddie DeVol?

303
00:18:43,485 --> 00:18:46,079
The guy is like a petty larceny scumbag.

304
00:18:46,254 --> 00:18:50,088
Hey, I ain't happy about it either.
But if he keeps Patti off my back, so be it.

305
00:18:51,559 --> 00:18:54,357
- Yeah?
- Mr. Vitti?

306
00:18:55,129 --> 00:18:58,155
- Mr. Bella asked to meet you in makeup.
- Can't. Gotta go.

307
00:18:58,332 --> 00:19:00,562
- It's important.
- I'll talk to him tomorrow.

308
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:04,602
Here, here.
Tell him you never saw me, okay?

309
00:19:08,209 --> 00:19:11,700
- Paul, excellent, mate. Come here, please.
- I can't talk right now, mate.

310
00:19:11,879 --> 00:19:14,348
I've gotta ask you a question.
Two seconds? Come on.

311
00:19:14,515 --> 00:19:15,847
- I gotta...
- Come on.

312
00:19:16,017 --> 00:19:18,212
- Can we do it later?
- Please. It's important.

313
00:19:18,386 --> 00:19:23,119
Paul, I'm looking for something to do when
my character finds out he's being indicted.

314
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:25,725
And I was thinking of punching the wall.

315
00:19:25,894 --> 00:19:29,694
But I did that when they killed Uncle Lenny,
and I punched a car...

316
00:19:29,863 --> 00:19:34,164
...actually, it was a van, when Peezee
screwed up the big drug-deal.

317
00:19:34,334 --> 00:19:38,294
So I'm looking
for something different this time.

318
00:19:38,473 --> 00:19:41,271
Something that doesn't involve,
you know, punching anything.

319
00:19:41,442 --> 00:19:44,206
Kick something. Let me know
how it works out. I gotta go.

320
00:19:44,379 --> 00:19:46,847
Paul, wait.
That's really interesting.

321
00:19:47,615 --> 00:19:50,412
- Kick what?
- I don't know. Like, kick a guy in the face.

322
00:19:50,584 --> 00:19:52,780
- Who?
- Anybody, just some guy.

323
00:19:52,954 --> 00:19:56,014
Knock him down, give him a
couple shots in the head and walk away.

324
00:19:56,189 --> 00:19:57,680
- Why?
- Why not?

325
00:19:57,859 --> 00:20:00,521
You're pissed, he's there.
I got friends waiting for me.

326
00:20:00,695 --> 00:20:03,754
My character wouldn't do that.
What else you got?

327
00:20:03,932 --> 00:20:06,526
- I don't know. You could yell real loud.
- Yell real loud?

328
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,100
That's really original.

329
00:20:08,269 --> 00:20:10,829
Shut your fucking mouth.
I don't care what you do. I gotta go.

330
00:20:11,004 --> 00:20:15,236
Shut your fucking mouth.
I don't care what you do. I gotta go.

331
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:17,970
- What'd you say?
- What'd you say?

332
00:20:18,146 --> 00:20:20,613
- Wait. What are you doing?
- Wait. What are you doing?

333
00:20:20,782 --> 00:20:24,649
- You can cut that shit out right now.
- You can cut that shit out right now.

334
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:31,820
That was bloody great!

335
00:20:32,526 --> 00:20:35,086
My character could do that.

336
00:20:41,135 --> 00:20:42,932
Thank you.

337
00:20:46,874 --> 00:20:49,535
Jelly? Where's Paul?

338
00:20:50,678 --> 00:20:53,340
Michael. What are you doing?

339
00:20:53,514 --> 00:20:56,642
I'm working for Mr. Vitti.
Yeah, I'm his driver now.

340
00:20:56,818 --> 00:21:00,254
Oh, no. No. No. No, Michael,
you are not doing that. Sorry.

341
00:21:00,419 --> 00:21:03,857
- You keep telling me to get a job.
- Making sandwiches at the Subway...

342
00:21:04,024 --> 00:21:05,356
...not driving a getaway car.

343
00:21:05,526 --> 00:21:06,514
Dad.

344
00:21:06,693 --> 00:21:10,357
No "Dad" about this. He should have
spoken to me before he spoke to you.

345
00:21:10,531 --> 00:21:12,122
All right. Where is he?

346
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:14,495
I cannot give you that information.

347
00:21:14,669 --> 00:21:17,727
You cannot give me that information?

348
00:21:17,905 --> 00:21:22,238
Look, I promised not to repeat anything
l heard in the car, okay? I took an oath.

349
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:25,106
You took an oath?
Was there blood involved?

350
00:21:25,847 --> 00:21:27,245
Ben?

351
00:21:27,415 --> 00:21:30,111
What...? What happened? Where were you?

352
00:21:30,283 --> 00:21:33,410
I'll tell you the truth. I was involved
in a high-speed car chase.

353
00:21:33,588 --> 00:21:35,351
- What?
- My car was totally shot out...

354
00:21:35,523 --> 00:21:38,356
...and the men who were
chasing us probably drowned.

355
00:21:38,526 --> 00:21:40,925
- Oh, my God!
- It's not as bad as it sounds.

356
00:21:41,461 --> 00:21:44,555
- When is this all gonna end?
- Tonight. I just have to find him.

357
00:21:44,732 --> 00:21:47,758
Why? A few days ago you weren't even
sure you wanted to be a therapist.

358
00:21:47,934 --> 00:21:52,463
Honey, I have to finish this.
I have to. Understand?

359
00:21:54,742 --> 00:21:55,765
Go.

360
00:21:55,943 --> 00:21:58,468
- Go. Just don't get shot.
- Okay.

361
00:21:58,646 --> 00:21:59,704
- Please.
- All right.

362
00:21:59,879 --> 00:22:02,941
- Hey, Clemenza. Where is he?
- I can't.

363
00:22:03,117 --> 00:22:04,947
You are gonna tell your father...

364
00:22:05,119 --> 00:22:08,053
...or so help me God, I'll kick
the ever-loving shit out of you.

365
00:22:08,222 --> 00:22:11,282
Little Darlings, okay? It's a club in Queens.

366
00:22:11,459 --> 00:22:14,553
- Give me the keys to the car.
- I'm responsible for the Town Car.

367
00:22:14,727 --> 00:22:16,856
- Give me the fucking keys!
- Take my car.

368
00:22:17,031 --> 00:22:18,019
- Okay.
- Here.

369
00:22:18,198 --> 00:22:20,291
Thank you. Bye.

370
00:22:44,658 --> 00:22:46,421
Hi.

371
00:22:49,897 --> 00:22:51,523
Excuse me.

372
00:22:51,698 --> 00:22:53,428
Excuse me.

373
00:22:53,601 --> 00:22:54,829
Jelly.

374
00:22:55,001 --> 00:22:58,528
- Hey, doc, what are you doing here?
- Where's Paul?

375
00:22:59,474 --> 00:23:01,704
- I think she likes you.
- I have to talk to Paul.

376
00:23:01,876 --> 00:23:04,537
Man, give her a few dollars.

377
00:23:07,615 --> 00:23:11,915
Hi. I only have a 20,
so could I get change?

378
00:23:12,084 --> 00:23:16,544
Ten, five, singles would be great.
Thank you.

379
00:23:20,794 --> 00:23:22,352
Okay.

380
00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:25,965
Thank you very much for giving me this.

381
00:23:28,302 --> 00:23:29,599
Thank you.

382
00:23:29,771 --> 00:23:36,175
Listen, this is my meter money,
l don't have any more bills, so...

383
00:23:41,749 --> 00:23:43,410
Where's Jelly?

384
00:23:51,158 --> 00:23:52,285
What are you doing?

385
00:23:52,459 --> 00:23:55,827
What do you mean? Blowing off
a little steam. What's the big deal?

386
00:23:55,995 --> 00:23:57,021
Here he is.

387
00:23:57,764 --> 00:24:00,598
- How's it going, Paulie?
- It's going all right.

388
00:24:00,767 --> 00:24:03,099
You know my guys?
Enormous Bobby and Al Pacino?

389
00:24:03,803 --> 00:24:05,361
Al Pacino? That's your real name?

390
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:09,874
No. They call me that
because I look like Al Pacino.

391
00:24:10,044 --> 00:24:13,035
- The actor.
- Anybody ever call you Carol Burnett?

392
00:24:13,214 --> 00:24:14,202
Why?

393
00:24:14,381 --> 00:24:18,715
Because you look as much like
Carol Burnett as you do Al Pacino.

394
00:24:21,555 --> 00:24:23,921
- What are you looking at?
- I actually see it.

395
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:28,254
It's, like, right through here,
it's just very much Pacino.

396
00:24:32,399 --> 00:24:33,697
So we're all here?

397
00:24:34,267 --> 00:24:36,896
- We're all here.
- Then let's do this, all right?

398
00:24:37,071 --> 00:24:39,164
- Let's do what?
- Let's go.

399
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:40,932
- Let's do what?
- Let's go.

400
00:24:42,209 --> 00:24:43,677
You're not telling me something.

401
00:24:43,843 --> 00:24:46,780
You're not telling me something.
I want to know what's going on.

402
00:24:46,947 --> 00:24:50,543
- I'm not leaving till you tell me...
- Get out of here. You're gonna get hurt.

403
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:15,901
Okay, this is big.

404
00:25:16,077 --> 00:25:20,070
We only got one shot, and there's a million
ways this fucking thing can go wrong...

405
00:25:20,247 --> 00:25:22,340
...so everybody listen carefully.

406
00:25:23,851 --> 00:25:27,514
The Federal Gold Depository
in downtown Manhattan.

407
00:25:27,687 --> 00:25:32,919
Three times a year, a shipment of Gold bars
Goes in a heavily Guarded armored truck...

408
00:25:33,093 --> 00:25:36,222
...from the depository to a vault
in the Federal Reserve...

409
00:25:36,397 --> 00:25:40,925
...to hold for foreiGn Governments
that trade in Gold bullion.

410
00:25:41,736 --> 00:25:45,535
Three o'clock in the morninG,
about eiGht hours from now...

411
00:25:45,706 --> 00:25:48,504
...we're gonna hijack that truck.

412
00:25:49,142 --> 00:25:52,704
All right, everybody look at the map.
This is where we're gonna be.

413
00:26:00,486 --> 00:26:04,447
- What the fuck is this?
- He was listening by the door.

414
00:26:05,726 --> 00:26:07,716
- Hi, guys.
- Get rid of him.

415
00:26:07,894 --> 00:26:10,022
- Hi, Carol.
- You're a dead man, asshole.

416
00:26:10,197 --> 00:26:13,062
Put the gun down.
Put the fucking gun down!

417
00:26:13,233 --> 00:26:15,064
Put the fucking gun down, okay?

418
00:26:15,236 --> 00:26:17,032
- What are you doing?
- What do you think?

419
00:26:17,204 --> 00:26:20,696
- He can make every guy in this room.
- Keep your hands off him. He's with me.

420
00:26:20,875 --> 00:26:23,139
Yeah? What, on the job?

421
00:26:23,311 --> 00:26:27,144
- Gonna start that "yeah, what?" shit again?
- Either he's in or he's dead. Which is it?

422
00:26:27,314 --> 00:26:30,250
I think in is better.
If I had a vote, I would vote in.

423
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:35,514
- He's in. He's my responsibility.
- Okay.

424
00:26:35,689 --> 00:26:40,093
No more surprises. And from this
moment on, no one leaves my sight.

425
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:41,250
Got it?

426
00:26:42,729 --> 00:26:43,787
Here, try this on.

427
00:26:43,965 --> 00:26:46,365
- Is this bulletproof?
- You better hope so.

428
00:26:46,533 --> 00:26:48,263
See if it fits under your shirt.

429
00:26:48,803 --> 00:26:51,430
I could fit you under my shirt.
Got anything smaller?

430
00:26:51,604 --> 00:26:53,334
What are we, a Bloomingdale's?

431
00:26:53,506 --> 00:26:57,533
Hey, nobody knew you were coming down.
You're lucky to be alive, you know.

432
00:26:57,711 --> 00:27:01,977
We're all gonna be lucky to be alive.
This plan is crazy. It's stupid.

433
00:27:02,148 --> 00:27:03,843
Hey, hey, watch it.

434
00:27:04,017 --> 00:27:07,146
Crazy, but not stupid.
You wanna stay alive?

435
00:27:07,321 --> 00:27:12,486
You do everything I tell you, keep your
mouth shut, and try not to pee your pants.

436
00:27:13,059 --> 00:27:15,119
- Can you handle an M-16?
- You mean shoot it?

437
00:27:15,294 --> 00:27:18,093
No, twirl it like a fucking baton.

438
00:27:18,264 --> 00:27:19,289
- AK?
- No.

439
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,562
- Kalashnikov?
- Jelly.

440
00:27:21,736 --> 00:27:25,934
- Stop me when something hits your fancy.
- Well, can't I just use that?

441
00:27:27,241 --> 00:27:31,142
Yeah. This brings back fond memories.

442
00:27:34,247 --> 00:27:37,081
- Use it in good health.
- Thanks.

443
00:27:38,753 --> 00:27:40,447
Great.

444
00:27:44,558 --> 00:27:47,151
Cold. Cold.

445
00:27:50,798 --> 00:27:54,165
- Check everything in there.
- Talk to the doc, I think he's caving in.

446
00:28:05,278 --> 00:28:07,439
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm great.

447
00:28:07,615 --> 00:28:09,912
I'll try to get you out before
the shit goes down.

448
00:28:10,084 --> 00:28:12,278
- Just don't flip out on me, okay?
- Right.

449
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:55,387
Here they come.

450
00:28:55,995 --> 00:28:57,588
Big, big mistake.

451
00:28:57,764 --> 00:28:59,858
- They're here.
- Go. Go! Go! Go!

452
00:29:10,977 --> 00:29:12,741
Are you fucking kidding me?

453
00:29:12,912 --> 00:29:15,245
Move the truck!

454
00:29:17,117 --> 00:29:18,142
Where you going?

455
00:29:21,553 --> 00:29:22,647
It's a setup!

456
00:29:24,191 --> 00:29:27,421
Everybody get down, watch the walls!
Watch the walls and the gates!

457
00:29:36,336 --> 00:29:39,067
On my command,
get the drivers back in the trucks.

458
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,707
You're gonna take the rear.
I'm gonna take the point.

459
00:29:41,876 --> 00:29:43,934
We're gonna back
these fuckers out of here.

460
00:29:45,846 --> 00:29:48,474
- What the fuck?
- They're lifting the truck!

461
00:29:48,648 --> 00:29:51,276
They're lifting the fucking truck!

462
00:29:51,785 --> 00:29:53,979
Son of a bitch!

463
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:00,625
Hold on!

464
00:30:00,794 --> 00:30:03,558
Hold on, Harold! Hold on!

465
00:30:03,863 --> 00:30:05,695
Going over.

466
00:30:07,067 --> 00:30:09,433
You have got to be fucking kidding me!

467
00:30:11,472 --> 00:30:12,459
Hang on!

468
00:30:26,285 --> 00:30:30,416
- It's not too late. You don't have to do this.
- Let's go. Let's go.

469
00:30:37,898 --> 00:30:41,093
What a day for my balls.

470
00:30:42,803 --> 00:30:45,236
Open the fucking door.

471
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:50,401
- Where's the keys?
- We don't have the keys.

472
00:30:50,577 --> 00:30:52,705
They've got the keys at the bank.

473
00:30:52,879 --> 00:30:54,870
Keep your fucking head down.

474
00:30:55,049 --> 00:30:56,482
Get over here!

475
00:30:58,885 --> 00:31:00,751
Move. Get the fuck in there.

476
00:31:02,254 --> 00:31:03,780
Here we go.

477
00:31:05,559 --> 00:31:08,754
Take the gate. You guys take the gate.
Get the wall. Climb the wall.

478
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,099
On the wall, guys. Get up on the wall!

479
00:31:16,637 --> 00:31:18,660
Get the gate! Move. Move. Move.

480
00:31:18,839 --> 00:31:20,067
Break through the gate.

481
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:31,012
Get the ramp.

482
00:31:31,184 --> 00:31:33,778
You know, this might just fucking work.

483
00:31:33,954 --> 00:31:36,923
Go! Go! Go! Get over the wall.
Come on.

484
00:31:39,226 --> 00:31:42,889
10-13, shots fired.
Need some backup.

485
00:31:43,495 --> 00:31:45,965
10-13, shots fired. Shots fired.

486
00:31:46,133 --> 00:31:48,794
Move! Move! Move! Over the wall!

487
00:31:48,968 --> 00:31:53,099
- Get over the goddamn wall!
- You get over the fucking wall!

488
00:31:59,879 --> 00:32:02,370
Fifty bars. Fifty bars is all we need.
Fifty bars.

489
00:32:02,549 --> 00:32:03,640
- Let's go.
- How much is that?

490
00:32:03,817 --> 00:32:08,254
350 an ounce, 16 ounces to a pound,
90 pounds to a bar. Do the math.

491
00:32:08,488 --> 00:32:12,218
- 22,995,000.
- What?

492
00:32:12,392 --> 00:32:14,258
Give or take.

493
00:32:15,896 --> 00:32:18,023
Hit it again!

494
00:32:19,366 --> 00:32:21,561
They're breaking down the door.

495
00:32:21,934 --> 00:32:24,995
Bobby, move up the Payloaders.
Move them up.

496
00:32:25,171 --> 00:32:26,901
So much for not peeing in my pants.

497
00:32:37,483 --> 00:32:39,452
- That's 50.
- All right, pack it up.

498
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:41,588
- Come on. Let's go.
- Let's get out of here.

499
00:32:41,754 --> 00:32:44,485
We're moving out.
We're moving out.

500
00:32:44,925 --> 00:32:48,325
Paul, remember what you said
about not flipping out?

501
00:32:48,495 --> 00:32:50,793
- Yeah.
- Sorry. What have I done?

502
00:32:50,964 --> 00:32:54,126
I had a perfect life,
and I threw it away!

503
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:56,995
I'm going to prison. That'll be bad.
I have delicate features.

504
00:32:57,169 --> 00:32:59,934
- I'm small. I'm gonna be popular.
- You gotta calm down!

505
00:33:00,107 --> 00:33:02,870
- I can't calm down. I'm gonna die.
- Calm down!

506
00:33:03,043 --> 00:33:05,477
- I can't breathe! I'm suffocating!
- Listen. Relax.

507
00:33:05,646 --> 00:33:08,341
- Get a hold of yourself!
- I can't! We're gonna die!

508
00:33:08,514 --> 00:33:11,278
- We're not gonna die.
- We are! We're all gonna die!

509
00:33:15,053 --> 00:33:17,683
- You feel better now?
- This is all my fault.

510
00:33:17,858 --> 00:33:20,986
I wanted to be there for you.
I really wanted to help you.

511
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:23,629
I want... But I couldn't
because I'm not good enough.

512
00:33:23,796 --> 00:33:29,235
Ever since my father died, I lost my way.
I didn't think this would hit me this hard.

513
00:33:31,772 --> 00:33:34,866
But, Paul, now I know how you felt
when your father was killed.

514
00:33:35,075 --> 00:33:36,474
We don't have time for this.

515
00:33:36,642 --> 00:33:38,041
- But it's...
- I'm telling you.

516
00:33:38,245 --> 00:33:40,303
- Don't do this.
- It was 10 times worse for you.

517
00:33:40,481 --> 00:33:42,812
- Don't do this.
- He was killed right in front of you.

518
00:33:42,983 --> 00:33:45,041
- You were just a little kid.
- Don't go there.

519
00:33:45,218 --> 00:33:47,651
- But it's so sad.
- Don't go there. I'm telling you...

520
00:33:47,821 --> 00:33:53,019
- All of his dreams for you died with him.
- There I go. You happy now?

521
00:33:54,459 --> 00:33:58,227
- He loved you, Paul. He really loved you.
- I know he did, and I loved him too.

522
00:33:58,398 --> 00:34:02,129
- Loved him too.
- I know. I know.

523
00:34:03,403 --> 00:34:04,894
Oh, boy, this is bad.

524
00:34:08,742 --> 00:34:09,833
How's the heist going?

525
00:34:20,053 --> 00:34:22,715
Did you really think
you were gonna live through this?

526
00:34:25,658 --> 00:34:27,751
- Yeah. I had my hopes.
- Well, nice work.

527
00:34:27,928 --> 00:34:31,556
- Mr. Rigazzi will be very grateful.
- I thought he worked for Patti LoPresti.

528
00:34:31,764 --> 00:34:34,893
Patti thought so too, but he played
both sides against the middle.

529
00:34:35,068 --> 00:34:38,367
There's only one side
as far as I'm concerned: mine.

530
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:40,572
What did you think?
I was gonna stand by...

531
00:34:40,741 --> 00:34:43,733
...and let some fucking broken-down valise
like you move back in?

532
00:34:44,178 --> 00:34:45,439
So long, Mr. Vitti.

533
00:34:53,786 --> 00:34:55,117
I can't take it anymore!

534
00:34:56,055 --> 00:34:58,751
That's what I hate
about you fucking sociopaths!

535
00:34:59,026 --> 00:35:01,893
You keep changing the rules
to suit yourselves!

536
00:35:02,062 --> 00:35:05,054
Well, not this time, you antisocial,
misfit piece of shit!

537
00:35:06,899 --> 00:35:08,992
This time
you fucked with the wrong shrink!

538
00:35:09,169 --> 00:35:11,466
You want a fresh one?

539
00:35:15,509 --> 00:35:17,135
This session is over.

540
00:35:25,117 --> 00:35:27,984
Son of a bitch. Ram it!

541
00:35:30,023 --> 00:35:31,819
Take them up and leave them there.

542
00:35:32,259 --> 00:35:35,456
- Nice going. Good plan.
- Shut up.

543
00:35:35,728 --> 00:35:38,322
- Bye.
- Yeah, what?

544
00:35:38,799 --> 00:35:41,165
What's a sociopath?

545
00:35:41,434 --> 00:35:42,594
I don't know.

546
00:35:43,237 --> 00:35:47,104
- Somebody!
- Come on, help us out here.

547
00:35:50,443 --> 00:35:53,344
Come on! This way! Come on!

548
00:35:53,514 --> 00:35:57,313
- They're getting away! Come on.
- Let's go!

549
00:36:12,765 --> 00:36:13,892
Drop your guns!

550
00:36:15,868 --> 00:36:17,894
Drop your guns!

551
00:36:18,538 --> 00:36:20,335
Drop your fucking guns!

552
00:36:21,707 --> 00:36:23,197
Drop your weapons, now!

553
00:36:24,277 --> 00:36:28,475
- Who the hell is this?
- Cut. Cut. Cut! What the hell is going on?

554
00:36:29,015 --> 00:36:31,348
Drop your fucking guns. Nobody move!

555
00:36:31,518 --> 00:36:36,148
Raoul! Look, if you're gonna
change the script, you have to tell us.

556
00:36:36,322 --> 00:36:39,656
Who are these people?
What are they doing in my shot?

557
00:36:39,893 --> 00:36:43,420
- What are you doing on my street?
- I have a permit!

558
00:36:43,596 --> 00:36:46,724
- Take your permit and stick it up your ass!
- Oh, my friend.

559
00:36:47,033 --> 00:36:49,194
Release traffic, please. Release traffic.

560
00:36:51,270 --> 00:36:54,103
This is like a bloody Chinese fire drill...

561
00:36:56,076 --> 00:36:57,099
Jesus!

562
00:36:57,277 --> 00:37:00,974
- You are in trouble. You are in trouble!
- You are gonna be in federal prison!

563
00:37:01,148 --> 00:37:03,081
Prison? You think I'm powerless?

564
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:06,242
- Enough. I'm going back to my trailer.
- No, you've gotta stay.

565
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:11,288
- Move these cars, goddamn you!
- You, please be quiet. I'm trying to think.

566
00:37:21,934 --> 00:37:25,461
- Is there a problem, officer?
- Keep your hands where I can see them.

567
00:37:26,273 --> 00:37:28,969
That's it, we're screwed.
We are so screwed.

568
00:37:35,514 --> 00:37:37,243
You.

569
00:37:37,483 --> 00:37:38,814
Me?

570
00:37:41,287 --> 00:37:44,313
- You're one tough shrink.
- All right.

571
00:38:00,206 --> 00:38:03,471
- Feeling pretty good, huh?
- Yeah, I'm feeling pretty good.

572
00:38:03,943 --> 00:38:07,505
What are you thinking?
I mean, what's next?

573
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:10,046
Do you go on the run
for the rest of your life?

574
00:38:10,216 --> 00:38:13,617
Do you just go back to Sing Sing?
Or maybe they find you dead in an alley?

575
00:38:13,786 --> 00:38:17,188
- How does this work now?
- Those are my choices?

576
00:38:18,858 --> 00:38:23,228
Hey, doc. Can't you let me enjoy this
for five fucking minutes?

577
00:38:23,397 --> 00:38:26,093
- Must you always be a fucking killjoy?
- Five minutes?

578
00:38:26,265 --> 00:38:29,633
- Five minutes.
- Okay. Five minutes.

579
00:38:30,971 --> 00:38:32,403
- And then what?
- And then what?

580
00:38:32,572 --> 00:38:36,474
- And then you'll see what.
- I'll see.

581
00:38:51,124 --> 00:38:55,685
WWEN news time, 8:06.
Seventy-two deGrees.

582
00:38:55,862 --> 00:39:00,059
A quick resolution to last niGht's
spectacular armored-car hijackinG.

583
00:39:01,201 --> 00:39:04,295
FBl aGents,

...and 11 other hiGh-rankinG
RiGazzi family associates.

588
00:39:20,519 --> 00:39:23,386

591

...and I'm happy to report to the people
of New York and to the entire nation...

592
00:39:36,368 --> 00:39:41,500
...that this Great city is today
a safer place to live and work.

593
00:39:41,841 --> 00:39:43,502
Questions?

594
00:39:54,587 --> 00:39:56,054
Hey, doc.

595
00:39:56,223 --> 00:39:58,087
- Did you see Patti?
- Yeah. I saw her.

596
00:39:58,258 --> 00:39:59,987
- You gonna be okay?
- Yeah. It's okay.

597
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:04,688
- She's glad the Wrench is out of the way.
- Good. Good. I spoke to the U.S. attorney.

598
00:40:04,965 --> 00:40:07,126
- What did he say?
- He's happy about the gold...

599
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:11,099
...and he said he won't come after you.
But you gotta stay out of trouble.

600
00:40:12,104 --> 00:40:14,038
Fuck him.

601
00:40:15,041 --> 00:40:16,974
So one big happy ending, right?

602
00:40:17,477 --> 00:40:20,604
- You gotta admit you feel better.
- Yeah. I feel better. Sure.

603
00:40:20,781 --> 00:40:23,443
Twenty million down the drain.
Why shouldn't I feel better?

604
00:40:23,617 --> 00:40:26,450
- You're grieving, Paul. It's a process.
- It's a process, I know.

605
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:29,417
It's not easy. But you gotta know
you did the right thing.

606
00:40:29,856 --> 00:40:31,152
You too, doc.

607
00:40:31,323 --> 00:40:34,316
- You hung in there. It took a lot of balls.
- I did what I had to.

608
00:40:34,795 --> 00:40:36,763
You were a monster.
I seen the beast in you.

609
00:40:36,929 --> 00:40:39,295
- A lot of misplaced aggression, that's all.
- Listen.

610
00:40:39,465 --> 00:40:42,332
I'm gonna send you after people
that I don't like.

611
00:40:42,501 --> 00:40:45,130
Give them a little psychology,
then beat them up.

612
00:40:51,111 --> 00:40:52,635
I wanna thank you, doc.

613
00:40:53,679 --> 00:40:56,648
- You don't have to thank me, Paul.
- You helped me out a lot.

614
00:40:58,818 --> 00:41:00,514
You.

615
00:41:01,188 --> 00:41:03,087
- You're good, you.
- No, I'm okay.

616
00:41:03,255 --> 00:41:06,122
No, no, no. You're very, very good.

617
00:41:06,393 --> 00:41:11,160
You got a gift, my friend.
I'm telling you, you got a gift.

618
00:41:11,831 --> 00:41:14,027
All right, I have a gift.

619
00:41:17,403 --> 00:41:19,064
All right.

620
00:41:20,139 --> 00:41:21,697
- Okay. Okay, doc.
- Thanks.

621
00:41:21,875 --> 00:41:23,308
- Yeah.
- Take it easy.

622
00:41:23,475 --> 00:41:25,740
- I'll see you.
- All right.

623
00:41:31,984 --> 00:41:33,384
Hey, doc.

624
00:42:44,724 --> 00:42:48,285
When I was a resident, we used to
actually play with the catatonics.

625
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:51,395
Just to have a little fun,
it's just so dreary.

626
00:42:58,604 --> 00:43:01,038
Okay, let's just... Okay.

627
00:43:08,581 --> 00:43:11,413
When I was a resident at Downstate...

628
00:43:11,584 --> 00:43:15,314
...we used to play with the catatonics,
just for a few laughs.

629
00:43:17,957 --> 00:43:19,755
Okay.

630
00:43:26,198 --> 00:43:28,359
I'm not hurting you.

631
00:43:29,501 --> 00:43:31,231
- Sorry.
- Marker.

632
00:43:31,403 --> 00:43:32,928
You told her at the drop of a hat.

633
00:43:33,106 --> 00:43:35,471
She's with the FBI.
She needs this information.

634
00:43:35,642 --> 00:43:38,337
I see. And I don't need this information.
Okay.

635
00:43:38,510 --> 00:43:42,880
No. No. Why? Why tell Paula?
She couldn't possibly handle a phone call.

636
00:43:43,049 --> 00:43:44,242
But your name's not Paula.

637
00:43:44,416 --> 00:43:46,009
- Who am I?
- Laura.

638
00:43:46,185 --> 00:43:47,846
Okay.

639
00:43:48,822 --> 00:43:50,652
- Hey, you.
- Coffee?

640
00:43:50,823 --> 00:43:53,291
- What?
- Somebody said something about coffee.

641
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:55,654
Yeah. That was you.
You said you wanted some.

642
00:43:55,828 --> 00:43:57,490
Yeah.

643
00:43:59,866 --> 00:44:01,127
- "So, what's the holdup?"
- I know.

644
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:04,394
I'm taking a long time.
I'm taking my moment.

645
00:44:05,270 --> 00:44:07,432
You also took mine.

646
00:44:09,142 --> 00:44:12,236
Here you go. Thank you very much.

647
00:44:18,451 --> 00:44:20,919
Hey, Michael.

648
00:44:21,987 --> 00:44:23,683
Jelly.

649
00:44:23,857 --> 00:44:25,721
Michael!

650
00:44:26,126 --> 00:44:27,889
If I could only get out of this car!

651
00:44:28,327 --> 00:44:30,353
Come on. Who would you...?
Who are we kidding?

652
00:44:30,529 --> 00:44:33,020
- You hated your father.
- I didn't hate my father.

653
00:44:33,198 --> 00:44:35,496
- No, I loved him.
- You hated your father.

654
00:44:35,667 --> 00:44:40,731
You hated him. You fucking hated him.
What the fuck we talking about?

655
00:44:44,510 --> 00:44:48,777
- All right. I got it. I'll stop.
- Good, that was good.

656
00:44:48,947 --> 00:44:51,508
- "Yeah. I can see how touched you are."
- Yeah, I can see how touched...

657
00:44:51,684 --> 00:44:53,514
- That's my line.
- That's your line.

658
00:44:54,721 --> 00:44:57,019
What am I doing here?
What are you doing here?

659
00:44:57,189 --> 00:45:00,386
I came here to tell you
that you have a preliminary...

660
00:45:00,794 --> 00:45:02,318
- Come back and try again.
- I will.

661
00:45:02,495 --> 00:45:05,089
Preliminary meeting. Preliminary meeting.

662
00:45:05,432 --> 00:45:09,162
You have a preliminary meeting
with your parole officer.

663
00:45:09,335 --> 00:45:11,529
Fuck you. Fuck you. It's "preliminary."

664
00:45:11,703 --> 00:45:14,831
I'm from the Bronx,
and it's 4:00 in the morning.

665
00:45:15,875 --> 00:45:17,433
Come in.

666
00:45:18,844 --> 00:45:21,143
Hey, doc, what are you doing here?

667
00:45:21,313 --> 00:45:24,305
- Preliminary.
- Yeah, preliminary.

668
00:45:25,518 --> 00:45:27,179
Come in.

669
00:45:27,453 --> 00:45:29,546
- No.
- All right.

670
00:45:29,721 --> 00:45:31,656
A marker.

671
00:45:31,825 --> 00:45:33,884
You know who was always
a favorite of mine?

672
00:45:34,059 --> 00:45:36,721
The late, great Groucho Marx.

673
00:45:36,996 --> 00:45:40,227
Because he would put stuff on his,
on his...

674
00:45:40,399 --> 00:45:42,993
He would draw them in on his eyebrows
and then...

675
00:45:43,169 --> 00:45:47,104
"That's the most ridiculous thing
I've heard." He would do stuff like that.

676
00:45:47,439 --> 00:45:51,536
Hey, look.
I'm the sheriff of the undersea club.

677
00:45:51,710 --> 00:45:54,270
Salute me, I'm Captain Midnight.

678
00:45:54,813 --> 00:45:56,974
Ultimately, it's just sad.

679
00:45:58,151 --> 00:46:01,916
That's what I've been jerking off to
the last 850 nights, a home-cooked meal.

680
00:46:02,087 --> 00:46:05,080
Yeah, like a nice fucking lamb chop.

681
00:46:08,594 --> 00:46:11,529
A nice home-cooked meal. Like...

682
00:46:12,866 --> 00:46:16,563
- Let me think of a good one.
- A tuna casserole?

683
00:46:23,175 --> 00:46:24,768
Help me.

684
00:46:26,746 --> 00:46:29,977
I just wanted to see it again.

685
00:46:30,282 --> 00:46:33,446
- We still going?
- We're good? Okay. We'll beat it to death.

686
00:46:35,020 --> 00:46:39,081
All right. That was great.
I think we can move on.

687
00:46:40,081 --> 00:46:50,081
