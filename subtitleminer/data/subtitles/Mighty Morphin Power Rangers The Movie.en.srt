00:01:25,898 --> 00:01:27,107
Whoo-hoo!

2
00:01:27,149 --> 00:01:29,610
- Come on, we're outta here!
- Easy, Rocky.

3
00:01:29,652 --> 00:01:32,780
All right, guys,
we're 15 seconds from the drop zone.

4
00:01:32,821 --> 00:01:35,908
All right, pinheads,
the Stealth Eagle's about to fly.

5
00:01:36,533 --> 00:01:39,036
Ditto for the Swooping Swallow.

6
00:01:39,078 --> 00:01:41,538
Well, lead on, flyboys.

7
00:01:49,672 --> 00:01:53,092
- That's a lotta air!
- After you, Skull!

8
00:01:53,133 --> 00:01:57,054
What are you? Crazy? This was your idea!

9
00:01:57,096 --> 00:02:00,933
Hey, guys. You might wanna slip those on.

10
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:04,687
Good idea.

11
00:02:05,938 --> 00:02:09,066
We're three seconds away
from the target zone. Aisha, you're on!

12
00:02:09,108 --> 00:02:10,943
Yes!

13
00:02:11,568 --> 00:02:12,820
Stylin'!

14
00:02:14,697 --> 00:02:16,865
On your tail! Whoo!

15
00:02:16,907 --> 00:02:19,076
All systems go!

16
00:02:21,578 --> 00:02:22,830
Banzai!

17
00:02:23,455 --> 00:02:25,332
Whoo-hoo!

18
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:31,588
- Show 'em your stuff.
- You got it. Surf's up!

19
00:02:32,214 --> 00:02:33,465
Whoo-hoo! Yeah!

20
00:02:34,091 --> 00:02:36,593
Catch you on the flip side.

Yeah! All right!

34
00:03:33,525 --> 00:03:36,654
All right, guys, let's break!

35
00:03:37,279 --> 00:03:39,114
# Gonna keep on tryin' #

With the arrival
of Ryan"s Comet two days away,

38
00:03:50,417 --> 00:03:54,171
the Angel Grove jump-a-thon will
breathe new life into the old observatory.

39
00:03:54,213 --> 00:03:57,257
Tickets to see the comet
are at the Fire Department booth.

40
00:03:57,299 --> 00:04:02,930
Now, folks, raise your eyes to the skies, cos
here comes the team from Angel Grove High!

41
00:04:07,309 --> 00:04:10,437
All right, Dad, pay close attention.
This is how the pros do it.

42
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:14,191
- I didn't do so bad.
- You landed in the parking lot.

43
00:04:14,233 --> 00:04:16,068
- It was embarrassing.
- Well...

44
00:04:16,694 --> 00:04:19,822
The first of the team
is beginning his final approach. It"s Adam!

45
00:04:19,863 --> 00:04:22,908
As he rounds the turn, he looks awful low...

46
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:27,287
but he pulls up just in time
and hits the target dead centre.

47
00:04:27,329 --> 00:04:32,960
Right behind him is skydiver Billy...
who manages a perfect landing!

48
00:04:33,002 --> 00:04:36,088
Skydiver number three is Kimberly!

49
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:39,216
Her landing is flawless!

50
00:04:39,842 --> 00:04:41,719
And here comes Rocky...

51
00:04:42,344 --> 00:04:43,554
who lands right on target!

52
00:04:43,595 --> 00:04:50,477
Here comes Aisha! She makes it a perfect five
out of five landing and ties the 1986 record.

53
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:53,605
So now it"s all up to Tommy Oliver.
Can he make it six for six?

54
00:04:53,647 --> 00:04:55,441
Yeah! Go, Tommy!

55
00:04:55,482 --> 00:04:59,862
He"s making his final approach.
Looks a bit wide, but still OK.

56
00:04:59,903 --> 00:05:02,323
Almost to the ground now. Can he do it?

57
00:05:02,364 --> 00:05:06,118
He does! The Angel Grove team
sets a new city record! Way to go, guys!

58
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,953
- Let's go.
- OK.

59
00:05:07,995 --> 00:05:12,041
Remember, folks, Ryan"s Comet
will be passing in just two days.

60
00:05:12,082 --> 00:05:16,128
- Looking good up there.
- Thanks. Maybe next time you can join us.

61
00:05:16,754 --> 00:05:17,963
Really? Could I?

62
00:05:18,005 --> 00:05:23,010
Yeah, well, we'll talk about that, Fred...
in about 10 or 12 years, all right?

63
00:05:23,052 --> 00:05:26,764
Congratulations, Tommy.
The observatory just got a new lease on life.

64
00:05:27,389 --> 00:05:29,224
- Yeah. Thanks, man.
Awesome.

65
00:05:29,266 --> 00:05:32,394
- Ryan's Comet is passing over in two days!
- Guys, we did it!

66
00:05:32,436 --> 00:05:35,147
- That was awesome, Tommy.
- Wonderful.

67
00:05:35,189 --> 00:05:36,899
- Thanks, guys. You too, man.

68
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:38,776
- Hey, has anybody seen Bulk and Skull?

69
00:05:38,817 --> 00:05:43,822
Ernie's is serving a free dessert with lunch.
They probably landed on the roof.

70
00:05:45,699 --> 00:05:49,453
Hurry up. We're runnin' out of fuel.
I gotta be the eagle.

71
00:05:49,495 --> 00:05:51,955
I'm gonna be the eagle!

72
00:05:51,997 --> 00:05:54,416
Be the swallow!

73
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:56,960
- Be the swallow.
- Come on, baby!

74
00:06:00,089 --> 00:06:03,217
Let go of me!
I want my mommy!

75
00:06:08,847 --> 00:06:11,350
Rock and roll!

76
00:06:11,976 --> 00:06:13,519
# The mountain is high #

77
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,104
# The valley is low #

78
00:06:15,729 --> 00:06:19,191
# And you're confused on
which way to go #

79
00:06:19,191 --> 00:06:22,778
# So I've come here to
give you a hand #

80
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:26,365
# And lead you into the promised land #

81
00:06:28,242 --> 00:06:30,119
- Air time!
- Up and away!

82
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:33,872
# Come on and take it be my side #

83
00:06:35,124 --> 00:06:38,252
# Come on and take a tree ride #

84
00:06:43,882 --> 00:06:46,385
- Let's take a shortcut.
- Right behind you!

85
00:06:47,636 --> 00:06:50,764
# Come on and take a free ride #

86
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:55,144
# Come on and take it by my side #

87
00:06:57,646 --> 00:07:02,026
Hey, this doesn't look like the target
landing zone! Where's the free food?

88
00:07:02,067 --> 00:07:06,405
You idiot! Your screaming threw off
the Stealth Eagle's sense of direction.

89
00:07:06,447 --> 00:07:09,533
Stealth Eagle? Lame duck is more like it.

90
00:07:10,784 --> 00:07:12,661
- Hey!
- Uh-oh.

91
00:07:13,287 --> 00:07:17,666
- You guys, what do you think you're doing?
- Uh...

92
00:07:18,917 --> 00:07:22,671
We're from the Angel Grove
Building Inspector's office.

93
00:07:23,297 --> 00:07:25,758
Yeah. That building's
supposed to be over there!

94
00:07:25,799 --> 00:07:29,553
And what's that man doing
without proper foot protection?

95
00:07:29,595 --> 00:07:32,056
- Who's in charge around here, huh?
- Huh?

96
00:07:32,097 --> 00:07:32,640
- Huh?
- Huh?

97
00:07:32,681 --> 00:07:35,184
Hey, Dave! Come and have a look at this.

98
00:07:36,435 --> 00:07:38,312
Go on, Dave.

99
00:07:39,563 --> 00:07:41,523
- That was a close one.
- Uh-huh.

100
00:07:41,565 --> 00:07:43,317
- You hungry?
- Always.

101
00:08:02,711 --> 00:08:05,839
What in the world is this?

102
00:08:05,881 --> 00:08:08,676
It sure as heck ain't DWP.

103
00:08:08,717 --> 00:08:11,470
Let's get a crane in here.

104
00:08:15,849 --> 00:08:17,726
OK, take it up!

105
00:08:47,131 --> 00:08:49,591
Incredible.

106
00:08:49,633 --> 00:08:52,761
What do you think it is?

107
00:08:52,803 --> 00:08:55,264
No... idea.

108
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,397
Aaaaarrgghh!

109
00:09:07,776 --> 00:09:09,653
John, you all right?

110
00:09:15,284 --> 00:09:17,786
Let's get somethin' to eat.

111
00:09:19,038 --> 00:09:20,914
Hang on.

112
00:09:22,791 --> 00:09:25,294
Let's go over there.

113
00:09:30,299 --> 00:09:34,053
- What's up, Alpha?
- Rangers, Zordon needs you. It"s urgent.

114
00:09:34,678 --> 00:09:36,555
We're on our way.

115
00:09:44,438 --> 00:09:48,192
Aye-yai-yai-yai! The subtronic
interphasers are short-circuiting.

116
00:09:48,817 --> 00:09:51,945
I have to find a way to alternate
the frequency modulators.

117
00:09:55,074 --> 00:09:56,909
What's goin' on?

118
00:09:56,950 --> 00:10:01,330
A massive surge of evil energy is
overloading our sensors. Aye-yai-yai-yai-yai!

119
00:10:01,955 --> 00:10:03,832
Rangers, you must act swiftly.

120
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:07,544
- The planet is in grave danger.
- Danger from what?

121
00:10:07,586 --> 00:10:12,591
6,000 years ago a morphological being
known as Ivan Ooze ruled the world

122
00:10:13,217 --> 00:10:15,678
with a reign of unparalleled terror.

123
00:10:15,719 --> 00:10:19,431
He was on the verge of completing
construction of his ultimate weapons:

124
00:10:19,473 --> 00:10:25,104
the Ecto-Morphicon Titans, twin machines
capable of enslaving the entire universe.

125
00:10:25,145 --> 00:10:26,313
What happened to him?

126
00:10:26,355 --> 00:10:30,734
A group of warriors like yourselves
lured him to into a hyperlock chamber

127
00:10:30,776 --> 00:10:32,569
and buried him deep underground.

128
00:10:32,611 --> 00:10:35,698
But now the chamber
has been accidentally uncovered.

129
00:10:35,739 --> 00:10:40,077
You must return it to the depths
before it is opened and Ivan is released.

130
00:10:40,119 --> 00:10:45,082
His Ecto-Morphicons were buried near
the chamber. If Ivan escapes, he'll find them.

131
00:10:45,124 --> 00:10:50,129
Use extreme caution, Rangers. You're dealing
with an evil that is beyond all imagination.

132
00:11:18,782 --> 00:11:21,910
- What do I care about some stupid egg?
- This is no ordinary egg!

133
00:11:22,536 --> 00:11:26,290
- Well, I say we hard-boil the thing!
- I'm with her. I'm hungry.

134
00:11:26,332 --> 00:11:31,253
- That's cos you're a pig!
- Hey, Kurt, take a look at this.

135
00:11:31,295 --> 00:11:36,300
No need to wake him. In fact,
why don't you take a little nap yourself?

136
00:11:42,556 --> 00:11:45,059
Yeah, I could do that.
I just choose not to.

137
00:11:45,684 --> 00:11:47,519
Zip your lips.

138
00:11:47,561 --> 00:11:51,023
After 2,000 years of searching...

139
00:11:51,023 --> 00:11:54,318
you are finally within my grasp.

140
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:57,571
And now... let's crack this egg.

141
00:12:18,217 --> 00:12:20,094
Excellent.

142
00:12:23,847 --> 00:12:25,099
Yuck!

143
00:12:30,729 --> 00:12:35,109
What?! You spent 2,000 years
looking for a tub of snot?!

144
00:12:35,734 --> 00:12:38,237
Patience, motor-mouth. Watch.

145
00:12:48,247 --> 00:12:48,872
Yes!

146
00:12:50,124 --> 00:12:51,375
Cool!

147
00:13:08,892 --> 00:13:12,021
Ladies and gentlemen!

148
00:13:12,062 --> 00:13:15,149
The Ooze is back!

149
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:16,358
Yeah!

150
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:19,486
- He's so handsome!
- Why, thank you.

151
00:13:19,528 --> 00:13:23,866
I am Lord Zedd, sworn enemy
of all that is good and decent.

152
00:13:23,907 --> 00:13:28,912
- It is a supreme honour to finally meet you.
- How can I ever repay you?

153
00:13:29,538 --> 00:13:33,292
Do you recall the name Zordon of Eltar?

154
00:13:42,051 --> 00:13:44,553
I think he's heard of him.

155
00:13:48,932 --> 00:13:54,563
I want you to destroy Zordon... so that
my evil may once again reign supreme!

156
00:13:54,605 --> 00:13:57,650
I will not only destroy him...

157
00:13:57,691 --> 00:14:00,778
I will obliterate his entire legacy.

158
00:14:00,819 --> 00:14:04,573
It will be as if Zordon of Eltar never existed!

159
00:14:04,615 --> 00:14:07,701
Finally, a real man!

160
00:14:09,578 --> 00:14:12,706
We shall leave you to weave your evil ways.

161
00:14:12,748 --> 00:14:14,583
Let's go, Rita.

162
00:14:25,844 --> 00:14:28,347
What is that odious stench?

163
00:14:30,849 --> 00:14:32,726
Smells like...

164
00:14:34,603 --> 00:14:37,106
teenagers.

165
00:14:43,362 --> 00:14:45,823
Anybody see anything?

166
00:14:45,864 --> 00:14:48,367
Let's take a look up there.

167
00:14:53,998 --> 00:14:55,249
Ugh!

168
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,961
What is it?
It reeks.

169
00:14:59,003 --> 00:15:02,131
Hey! What are you kids doin' here?

170
00:15:04,008 --> 00:15:07,761
You haven't seen a morphological being
lurking around here?

171
00:15:07,803 --> 00:15:10,889
- A morphological being?
- Yeah.

172
00:15:10,931 --> 00:15:13,392
What the heck is that?

173
00:15:13,434 --> 00:15:15,227
Wait a second.

174
00:15:15,269 --> 00:15:18,397
Did it look something like this?

175
00:15:22,151 --> 00:15:27,114
- Ew, gross!
- Too kind. Allow me to introduce myself.

176
00:15:27,156 --> 00:15:33,412
I am the galactically feared,
globally reviled, universally despised...

177
00:15:33,454 --> 00:15:37,124
They call me Ivan Ooze.

178
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:40,919
Well, pack your bags, cos we're sending
you back where you came from.

179
00:15:40,961 --> 00:15:44,673
Gee, a teenager with a big mouth.

180
00:15:45,299 --> 00:15:47,760
Not much has changed in 6,000 years.

181
00:15:47,801 --> 00:15:52,181
You obviously don't know
who you're dealing with, Mr Raisin Head.

182
00:15:52,222 --> 00:15:55,309
- Really?
- Yeah. We're the Power Rangers.

183
00:15:55,351 --> 00:15:59,063
Where's my autograph book? Ha!

184
00:15:59,688 --> 00:16:02,149
Power Rangers, huh?

185
00:16:02,191 --> 00:16:07,821
So Zordon's still usin'
a bunch of kids to do his dirty work.

186
00:16:09,073 --> 00:16:11,575
Well... meet my kids!

187
00:16:22,211 --> 00:16:23,462
Ew.

188
00:16:25,339 --> 00:16:30,970
From this moment forth
the world as you know it shall cease to exist!

189
00:16:31,011 --> 00:16:32,846
Welcome to my nightmare!

190
00:16:35,349 --> 00:16:36,600
Bye-bye, kiddies!

191
00:16:39,061 --> 00:16:40,312
He's gone.

192
00:16:44,692 --> 00:16:48,445
- What are we gonna do?
There's plenty of room down there.

193
00:16:48,487 --> 00:16:50,322
Go, guys!

194
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:03,460
- Let's take these beasts!
- Spread out!

195
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:10,342
Welcome to my nightmare.

196
00:17:10,968 --> 00:17:12,845
# Action boy now #

197
00:17:12,886 --> 00:17:14,680
# Action girl now #

198
00:17:14,722 --> 00:17:17,224
# Be prepared to climb
another mountain #

199
00:17:19,727 --> 00:17:21,603
Ever play Kick The Can?

200
00:17:22,855 --> 00:17:24,106
# Action boy now #

201
00:17:24,732 --> 00:17:25,941
# Action girl now #

202
00:17:25,983 --> 00:17:29,111
# Be prepared to surf across
the ocean #

203
00:17:30,362 --> 00:17:32,865
Kiss and make up.

204
00:17:35,367 --> 00:17:37,244
# To fill your plate #

205
00:17:37,286 --> 00:17:38,495
# Be prepared #

206
00:17:38,537 --> 00:17:39,747
# Don't hesitate #

207
00:17:40,998 --> 00:17:41,582
# Be prepared #

208
00:17:41,623 --> 00:17:44,126
# For a great big bust #

209
00:17:44,168 --> 00:17:44,752
# Be prepared #

210
00:17:45,377 --> 00:17:46,003
# To do what you must #

211
00:17:47,254 --> 00:17:47,880
# Be prepared #

212
00:17:48,505 --> 00:17:49,757
# To take a hit #

213
00:17:51,008 --> 00:17:51,633
Let me get the door.

214
00:17:54,136 --> 00:17:54,762
# Be prepared #

215
00:17:55,387 --> 00:17:56,639
# For a sneak attack #

216
00:17:59,767 --> 00:18:01,018
You ooze, you lose.

217
00:18:04,146 --> 00:18:06,023
Sit down!

218
00:18:06,649 --> 00:18:08,525
See ya!

219
00:18:09,151 --> 00:18:11,654
Right behind you, Kimberly.

220
00:18:22,289 --> 00:18:24,792
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

221
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:26,043
Adam!

222
00:18:27,294 --> 00:18:31,048
They got us cornered!
We can't hold them off!

223
00:18:35,427 --> 00:18:39,807
There's too many of 'em.
- Let's do it, guys! It's morphin' time!

224
00:18:39,848 --> 00:18:42,309
Pterodactyl!

225
00:18:44,186 --> 00:18:46,063
Triceratops!

226
00:18:48,565 --> 00:18:50,442
Tyrannosaurus!

227
00:18:52,945 --> 00:18:54,822
Mastodon!

228
00:18:57,324 --> 00:18:59,827
Sabre-toothed tiger!

229
00:19:01,704 --> 00:19:03,580
White tiger!

230
00:19:06,709 --> 00:19:09,211
# Go, go, Power Rangers #

231
00:19:11,714 --> 00:19:14,174
# Go, go, Power Rangers #

232
00:19:14,216 --> 00:19:19,847
# Mighty Morphin Power Rangers #

233
00:19:21,724 --> 00:19:24,852
- Where'd they go?
- Keep your eyes peeled.

234
00:19:26,729 --> 00:19:28,605
Heads up, guys! Over there!

235
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:35,487
- Careful. It could be a trap.
- Right.

236
00:19:35,529 --> 00:19:37,656
Let's go.

237
00:19:42,578 --> 00:19:46,332
Alpha, my sensors tell me
the Rangers were too late.

238
00:19:46,373 --> 00:19:49,418
- Ivan is on his way here.
- Don't worry.

239
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:53,213
Nobody enters the command centre
without a power coin.

240
00:19:55,716 --> 00:19:57,593
Well, almost nobody.

241
00:20:14,485 --> 00:20:16,987
Hey, pretty fancy-schmancy.

242
00:20:17,613 --> 00:20:20,741
I guess if you invest
your money well over 60 centuries,

243
00:20:20,783 --> 00:20:23,243
you can buy something pretty nice.

244
00:20:24,495 --> 00:20:25,746
Uh-oh.

245
00:20:28,248 --> 00:20:31,335
Aye-yai-yai-yai-yai-yai-yai...

246
00:20:31,377 --> 00:20:36,965
You haven't changed, Ooze. You're still
picking on creatures smaller than yourself.

247
00:20:37,007 --> 00:20:43,263
Put a sock in it, Z! 10 minutes out of the egg
and I'm listening to one of your lectures.

248
00:20:43,305 --> 00:20:46,350
You locked me into your
stuffy hyperlock chamber

249
00:20:46,392 --> 00:20:50,104
and tossed me away in the depths
like yesterday's trash.

250
00:20:50,145 --> 00:20:56,402
You any idea what it's like to be locked up
in a rotten egg for 6,000 years? It's boring.

251
00:20:56,443 --> 00:20:59,530
Not to mention I've had a charley horse
since the Renaissance.

252
00:21:00,155 --> 00:21:05,160
- You won't get away with this, Ooze.
- You robbed me of my prime.

253
00:21:05,202 --> 00:21:10,165
I was the supreme ruler
of the most foul empire in the universe.

254
00:21:10,207 --> 00:21:13,919
And now... it's time to pay the piper.

255
00:21:18,924 --> 00:21:21,427
Oh, the things that I have missed!

256
00:21:21,468 --> 00:21:23,304
The Black Plague!

257
00:21:24,555 --> 00:21:27,057
The Spanish Inquisition!

258
00:21:30,811 --> 00:21:33,314
The Brady Bunch reunion!

259
00:22:00,215 --> 00:22:03,969
This place gives me the creeps.
I heard that.

260
00:22:10,225 --> 00:22:13,354
I've got a bad feelin'
about this place.

261
00:22:23,364 --> 00:22:26,492
Anybody see anything?
- We need some light.

262
00:22:26,533 --> 00:22:28,994
Activating power beam.

263
00:23:00,275 --> 00:23:03,404
- They gotta be around here somewhere.
- Activating power scope.

264
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,783
Talk to me, Rocky. What do we got?

265
00:23:08,409 --> 00:23:13,414
I don't know what these purple creeps
are made of, but I can't lock 'em down.

266
00:23:13,455 --> 00:23:15,916
All right. Stay alert.

267
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:22,756
- Over there!
- Let's power up!

268
00:23:22,798 --> 00:23:25,301
Right!
Here they come!

269
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:32,808
You guys make me sick, sick, sick!

270
00:23:52,828 --> 00:23:54,079
Back off!

271
00:23:56,582 --> 00:23:59,084
Have a nice flight!

272
00:24:02,212 --> 00:24:04,715
Later, dudes.

273
00:24:30,366 --> 00:24:32,868
It's gonna be one messy night.

274
00:24:40,376 --> 00:24:42,252
- Up and over?
- Let's do it!

275
00:24:51,637 --> 00:24:52,888
Rocky, behind you!

276
00:24:54,139 --> 00:24:56,016
Goin' airborne!

277
00:24:59,770 --> 00:25:02,898
These guys don't know when to quit.
Double whammy?

278
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:04,775
You're on.

279
00:25:06,026 --> 00:25:07,903
Uh-oh!

280
00:25:12,282 --> 00:25:14,159
Whoaaaa!

281
00:25:15,411 --> 00:25:17,287
That does it. Stegastinger!

282
00:25:22,918 --> 00:25:24,795
Did you miss me?

283
00:25:32,303 --> 00:25:34,763
Pterodactyl Thunderwhip!

284
00:25:34,805 --> 00:25:37,308
Have a nice trip! See you next fall.

285
00:25:41,687 --> 00:25:42,938
Bye-bye.

286
00:25:44,189 --> 00:25:46,066
Gotta love it.

287
00:26:08,589 --> 00:26:10,466
Hold on, Aisha!

288
00:26:12,968 --> 00:26:15,471
One, two, three, four, five, six!

289
00:26:16,096 --> 00:26:17,973
Aisha!

290
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:21,685
- You OK?
- They're tough.

291
00:26:21,727 --> 00:26:24,855
- Let's finish these purple parasites.
- You said it.

292
00:26:37,993 --> 00:26:39,870
I want you guys to meet Saba.

293
00:26:52,383 --> 00:26:53,008
Uh-oh!

294
00:26:55,511 --> 00:26:56,762
Yeah!

295
00:26:58,639 --> 00:27:00,516
Now let's go find Ivan.

296
00:27:03,185 --> 00:27:06,313
Hey, what's happening?

297
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:10,693
We're losing power.

298
00:27:16,949 --> 00:27:19,451
- What's goin' on?
- Alpha, come in.

299
00:27:23,205 --> 00:27:26,959
- Something's wrong.
- We'd better get back. Let's go, guys.

300
00:27:36,343 --> 00:27:38,804
Oh, no.

301
00:27:38,846 --> 00:27:40,723
- Ooze.
Let's get it open.

302
00:27:50,107 --> 00:27:52,568
Look at this place.

303
00:27:52,609 --> 00:27:55,112
I can't believe it.

304
00:27:55,738 --> 00:27:58,240
What happened here?

305
00:27:59,491 --> 00:28:01,368
Oh, no.

306
00:28:05,748 --> 00:28:06,957
Zordon!

307
00:28:06,999 --> 00:28:10,085
What's happening to him?

308
00:28:10,127 --> 00:28:12,629
Outside of his time warp, he's dying.

309
00:28:13,881 --> 00:28:15,758
He needs power.

310
00:28:17,635 --> 00:28:20,095
Rangers.

311
00:28:20,137 --> 00:28:22,640
Thank goodness you are safe.

312
00:28:23,265 --> 00:28:25,768
Come on, we gotta get you back inside.

313
00:28:27,019 --> 00:28:29,521
I'm afraid that is impossible.

314
00:28:30,773 --> 00:28:33,901
The power has been destroyed.

315
00:28:35,152 --> 00:28:37,363
It is gone.

316
00:28:37,363 --> 00:28:39,406
The Zords...

317
00:28:39,448 --> 00:28:41,408
the weapons...

318
00:28:42,034 --> 00:28:43,869
all of it.

319
00:28:43,911 --> 00:28:48,290
The Power Rangers are no more.

320
00:28:48,332 --> 00:28:50,751
Ivan Ooze has won.

321
00:28:50,793 --> 00:28:54,546
- We're losing him.
- Zordon, you can't leave us!

322
00:28:55,798 --> 00:29:00,803
Ever since you came into our lives,
you've been like a father to us all.

323
00:29:01,428 --> 00:29:05,182
You must be strong.

324
00:29:10,187 --> 00:29:12,022
Rangers!

325
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:13,941
Alpha.

326
00:29:16,443 --> 00:29:18,320
- Are you OK?
- I'll be fine.

327
00:29:18,946 --> 00:29:22,032
There may be a power
that can save Zordon.

328
00:29:22,074 --> 00:29:25,786
- What power?
- It is on the distant planet of Phaedos.

329
00:29:25,828 --> 00:29:30,165
It's very dangerous.
All who have tried for it have perished.

330
00:29:30,207 --> 00:29:35,212
- But we have to try, Alpha.
- Zordon's life force will not last long.

331
00:29:35,254 --> 00:29:38,299
- You won't have much time.
- How can we get it?

332
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:42,720
Maybe if I can download the last plasmatic
morphing gem into the transport core,

333
00:29:42,761 --> 00:29:45,806
I might have just enough power
to get you there.

334
00:29:45,848 --> 00:29:50,227
- But there won't be any left to get you back.
- So, how do we get back?

335
00:29:50,269 --> 00:29:53,355
We have to hope that the power is there.

336
00:29:54,606 --> 00:29:56,483
Zordon's life depends on it.

337
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:00,237
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.

338
00:30:04,616 --> 00:30:07,745
We may not have our powers,
but we're still the Power Rangers.

339
00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:11,498
Remember, Rangers,
Zordon doesn't have much time.

340
00:30:26,513 --> 00:30:30,267
Oh, no! Aye-yai-yai-yai-yai!

341
00:30:30,309 --> 00:30:32,770
Please hold on, Zordon!

342
00:30:39,026 --> 00:30:42,780
I can't believe it! How could he
let them slip through his hands?!

343
00:30:42,821 --> 00:30:45,908
He's no better than the rest of the hired help!

344
00:30:45,949 --> 00:30:48,410
Oh, give it a rest.

345
00:30:52,164 --> 00:30:55,918
- Hi, honey, I'm home!
- You egg-sucking purple pinhead!

346
00:30:55,959 --> 00:30:58,420
The Rangers are going after the great power!

347
00:30:59,046 --> 00:31:02,174
I thought you said this guy
was the master of disaster!

348
00:31:02,216 --> 00:31:04,677
He's nothing but
a slime-infested jelly doughnut!

349
00:31:05,928 --> 00:31:08,430
Finally someone shut her up.

350
00:31:10,307 --> 00:31:13,102
Your feebleness is staggering.

351
00:31:13,143 --> 00:31:15,896
You obviously need a vacation.

352
00:31:15,938 --> 00:31:20,943
I think circumstances
force us to choose a new leader...

353
00:31:20,985 --> 00:31:24,071
and I pick... me!

354
00:31:27,199 --> 00:31:30,327
Who does this clown think he's dealing with?

355
00:31:30,369 --> 00:31:33,455
The bogeyman is taking over.

356
00:31:34,081 --> 00:31:37,835
No one double-crosses Lord Zedd and lives!

357
00:31:39,712 --> 00:31:42,840
Oh, stop it! It tickles!

358
00:31:45,342 --> 00:31:47,219
My turn.

359
00:31:54,101 --> 00:31:59,732
Way to go, bonehead!
You can't trust anyone in this galaxy!

360
00:31:59,773 --> 00:32:03,193
- I love snow globes.
Earthquake! Earthquake!

361
00:32:03,235 --> 00:32:06,488
Now you have a choice. You either serve me...

362
00:32:06,530 --> 00:32:09,700
or you can join these
insufferable dingledorks!

363
00:32:09,742 --> 00:32:13,495
- Goldar, get us out of here!
- Don't listen to that purple booger!

364
00:32:13,537 --> 00:32:15,372
Don't you dare betray me!

365
00:32:15,998 --> 00:32:20,336
- We never liked those dingledorks.
You said it. They stink.

366
00:32:20,377 --> 00:32:26,008
So... what are we going to do about
the Power Rangers, oh my hideous one?

367
00:32:26,634 --> 00:32:28,469
Ah, yes.

368
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:31,013
The Power Rangers.

369
00:32:41,649 --> 00:32:43,525
- Good distance.
- Yeah.

370
00:33:16,058 --> 00:33:21,689
Shut your beaks! Now,
my Tengu Warriors, you will fly to Phaedos,

371
00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:27,319
you will find the Power Rangers
and you will tear them apart!

372
00:33:32,324 --> 00:33:35,452
Go sic 'em, Tweety!
Happy hunting!

373
00:34:11,113 --> 00:34:12,364
Wow.

374
00:34:16,744 --> 00:34:19,830
My gosh. Look at this place.

375
00:34:19,872 --> 00:34:23,625
You guys! Over here! Quick!

376
00:34:34,261 --> 00:34:37,348
Whoa. Looks like
somebody had a bad day.

377
00:34:37,389 --> 00:34:41,769
- What is it?
- I think the question is "What was it?"

378
00:34:42,394 --> 00:34:45,522
Definitely not the welcoming committee,
that's for sure.

379
00:34:45,564 --> 00:34:48,025
Come on, guys, we got a job to do.

380
00:35:18,681 --> 00:35:21,767
Taking over the world is one thing.

381
00:35:21,809 --> 00:35:24,937
Finding good help to run it for you,
that's the killer.

382
00:35:24,979 --> 00:35:28,065
Would you like me to make a few calls?

383
00:35:28,691 --> 00:35:33,654
No need. I'm going to recruit
the parents of Angel Grove.

384
00:35:33,696 --> 00:35:38,075
No offence, boss,
but they might find you a little disgusting.

385
00:35:39,326 --> 00:35:42,454
Well, I suppose you'd be the experts on that.

386
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:48,085
- You forget. I'm a master of disguise.
- How could I forget? I never knew.

387
00:35:48,711 --> 00:35:51,171
First I'll turn them into zombies

388
00:35:51,213 --> 00:35:54,967
and then order them
to dig up my Ecto-Morphicons.

389
00:35:55,009 --> 00:35:56,844
How you gonna do that?

390
00:35:57,469 --> 00:36:03,100
By showing them the wonders
of being wicked with a little bit of Ivan's ooze.

391
00:36:10,607 --> 00:36:11,859
Ooh!

392
00:36:17,489 --> 00:36:23,078
Finally I get to finish
what I started 6,000 years ago!

393
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:28,125
Little do they know my weapons of
destruction lie buried beneath their feet.

394
00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:37,509
- Stop it! Get to work!
Yes, Your Royal Heinous Highness.

395
00:36:58,155 --> 00:37:00,032
Hey.

396
00:37:00,658 --> 00:37:01,533
You OK?

397
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:05,663
I was just thinking about Zordon.

398
00:37:06,914 --> 00:37:10,668
You know, everything
we've been through together.

399
00:37:11,293 --> 00:37:13,796
Look, he's gonna make it.

400
00:37:15,047 --> 00:37:16,924
We'll find this power

401
00:37:17,549 --> 00:37:22,554
and then send that slimeball Ivan Ooze
back to the sewer he crawled out of.

402
00:37:22,596 --> 00:37:24,431
Come on.

403
00:37:26,934 --> 00:37:28,811
What the heck was that?

404
00:37:30,688 --> 00:37:32,564
Get down!

405
00:37:37,569 --> 00:37:38,821
Let's move!

406
00:37:41,949 --> 00:37:43,200
Look out!

407
00:37:48,831 --> 00:37:50,708
They're everywhere!

408
00:37:50,749 --> 00:37:52,584
Take cover!

409
00:38:00,092 --> 00:38:01,969
Back off.

410
00:38:12,604 --> 00:38:15,441
- Know the funny thing about morphin'?
- What?

411
00:38:15,441 --> 00:38:18,235
You don't appreciate it till you can't do it!

412
00:38:23,866 --> 00:38:26,368
Kimberly, behind you!

413
00:38:30,122 --> 00:38:32,624
Hang on, Kimberly!

414
00:38:35,127 --> 00:38:37,004
Somebody help me!

415
00:38:38,255 --> 00:38:40,758
- They're too strong!
- We need our powers!

416
00:38:45,137 --> 00:38:47,806
Let me go, Big Bird!

417
00:39:47,866 --> 00:39:50,369
That was amazing. Thanks.

418
00:39:52,246 --> 00:39:56,625
If you want to thank me,
go back to wherever it is you came from.

419
00:39:57,251 --> 00:39:59,753
- We can't.
- We were told there was a great power here.

420
00:39:59,795 --> 00:40:02,214
- Is it true?
- Yes.

421
00:40:02,256 --> 00:40:07,261
The ground is littered with the bones
of those who have tried for it and failed.

422
00:40:09,763 --> 00:40:12,891
Well, we're different. We won't fail.

423
00:40:17,271 --> 00:40:20,399
Leave Phaedos... before it's too late.

424
00:40:22,276 --> 00:40:25,404
Look, we don't want any trouble.
Our leader Zordon got hurt...

425
00:40:26,030 --> 00:40:27,281
Zordon?

426
00:40:27,906 --> 00:40:29,783
Did you say Zordon?

427
00:40:30,409 --> 00:40:32,911
You know Zordon? Who are you?

428
00:40:37,916 --> 00:40:42,296
I am Dulcea, master warrior
of the planet Phaedos.

429
00:40:43,547 --> 00:40:45,382
What has happened to Zordon?

430
00:40:45,424 --> 00:40:48,552
He was attacked by
this cosmic being named Ivan Ooze.

431
00:40:48,594 --> 00:40:51,680
- Ivan Ooze is free?
- You've heard of him?

432
00:40:52,306 --> 00:40:54,183
Ivan Ooze is a monster.

433
00:40:54,808 --> 00:40:57,936
If we don't hurry, your planet is doomed.

434
00:40:57,978 --> 00:40:59,813
Follow me.

435
00:41:19,833 --> 00:41:23,587
Alpha, I am deeply concerned
about the Rangers.

436
00:41:23,629 --> 00:41:26,090
Please, Zordon, save your strength.

437
00:41:26,131 --> 00:41:28,550
You need to rest.

438
00:41:28,592 --> 00:41:33,555
We must try to communicate with them.
It is possible I can help them.

439
00:41:33,597 --> 00:41:39,228
If I could locate a vertical deflector, we could
make contact through the viewing globe.

440
00:41:39,853 --> 00:41:42,940
Please... please hurry.

441
00:41:42,982 --> 00:41:45,484
Aye-yai-yai-yai-yai! Hold on.

442
00:41:46,735 --> 00:41:51,115
Guys and girls, girls and guys,
gather round and feast your eyes.

443
00:41:51,156 --> 00:41:53,617
I promise you all, you just can't lose,

444
00:41:54,243 --> 00:41:56,704
when you've got
your own supply of Ivan's ooze.

445
00:41:56,745 --> 00:42:01,125
What are we supposed to do with it?
- Show it to parents, show it to friends.

446
00:42:01,166 --> 00:42:04,253
When you've got your ooze,
the fun never ends.

447
00:42:04,295 --> 00:42:06,088
This is kinda gross.

448
00:42:06,130 --> 00:42:09,216
You may have heard
that looks can be deceiving.

449
00:42:09,258 --> 00:42:12,386
I'm sure that when you've tried it,
you all will be believing.

450
00:42:12,428 --> 00:42:14,847
And did I mention it's free?

451
00:42:14,888 --> 00:42:17,391
- I'll take some.
- Here you go. Who else?

452
00:42:19,893 --> 00:42:24,273
OK, there's enough for everybody.
Take it home in boxes, take it home in cases.

453
00:42:24,315 --> 00:42:28,652
If your parents try to stop you,
just throw it in their faces!

454
00:42:36,785 --> 00:42:39,288
Dulcea, where are you taking us?

455
00:42:39,330 --> 00:42:42,374
You shall know soon enough.

456
00:42:42,416 --> 00:42:46,170
We have to hurry.
Zordon won't last much longer.

457
00:42:59,933 --> 00:43:01,185
Wow.

458
00:43:01,810 --> 00:43:04,271
Amazing.
What is this place?

459
00:43:04,313 --> 00:43:08,692
These are the ancient ruins
of the Ninjetti Temple.

460
00:43:12,446 --> 00:43:16,200
There, beyond the Niola Jungle,
is the monolith.

461
00:43:16,825 --> 00:43:19,912
Inside awaits the power of the universe.

462
00:43:19,953 --> 00:43:23,999
The monolith
is heavily guarded against intruders.

463
00:43:24,041 --> 00:43:28,087
No one has ever survived
an attempt to reach it.

464
00:43:28,128 --> 00:43:30,547
Then how can we?

465
00:43:30,589 --> 00:43:33,092
You were chosen by Zordon.

466
00:43:33,717 --> 00:43:36,845
I have faith in his wisdom.

467
00:43:36,887 --> 00:43:39,348
Can you help us?

468
00:43:40,599 --> 00:43:44,979
We will call upon
the sacred animals of the Ninjetti for help.

469
00:44:04,331 --> 00:44:05,582
Fred!

470
00:44:46,248 --> 00:44:49,376
There, that should do it. Let's give it a whirl!

471
00:44:50,002 --> 00:44:54,381
Police have been fielding
hundreds of calls from concerned citizens

472
00:44:54,423 --> 00:44:57,509
as the number of missing parents
continues to grow.

473
00:44:58,135 --> 00:45:01,847
Hi, folks. Ivan Ooze here.
Are you bored with your work?

474
00:45:01,889 --> 00:45:06,894
Are you bored with your life? Then come on
down to Ooze City and let"s get sticky!

475
00:45:07,519 --> 00:45:09,355
Aye-yai-yai-yai-yai!

476
00:45:09,396 --> 00:45:11,899
Ivan's evil plot is taking shape.

477
00:45:15,027 --> 00:45:17,446
I just hope they're not too late.

478
00:45:39,885 --> 00:45:45,516
Buried deep within each of us
is an animal spirit waiting to be released.

479
00:45:46,767 --> 00:45:49,895
Close your eyes and look deep inside.

480
00:46:45,576 --> 00:46:50,581
Aisha, you are the bear,
fierce and unstoppable.

481
00:46:53,709 --> 00:46:58,088
Rocky, powerful, smart,
you are the mighty ape.

482
00:47:01,216 --> 00:47:06,221
Billy, you are the wolf, cunning and swift.

483
00:47:09,350 --> 00:47:14,980
Agile Kimberly, light as a feather,
you are the crane.

484
00:47:18,108 --> 00:47:18,984
Adam...

485
00:47:20,611 --> 00:47:23,739
- Adam, what's wrong?
- I'm a frog.

486
00:47:25,616 --> 00:47:29,995
Yes, a frog. Like the one you kiss...
to get a handsome prince.

487
00:47:34,375 --> 00:47:38,754
And you, Tommy, are the falcon,
winged lord of the skies.

488
00:47:41,882 --> 00:47:47,513
To be in harmony with a sacred animal
spirit is to have the force of the Ninjetti.

489
00:47:48,764 --> 00:47:53,143
To those who are Ninjetti,
anything is possible.

490
00:47:56,271 --> 00:48:00,025
But... I am afraid
you must do this on you own.

491
00:48:01,902 --> 00:48:04,405
You're not coming with us, Dulcea?

492
00:48:05,656 --> 00:48:07,491
If only I could.

493
00:48:07,533 --> 00:48:13,789
One step beyond this plateau and I would
begin to age as rapidly as Zordon is now.

494
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:18,460
The strength is inside you. Trust it.

495
00:48:18,502 --> 00:48:21,922
Your sacred animals will be your guide.

496
00:48:25,676 --> 00:48:28,804
May your animal spirits watch over you.

497
00:48:44,445 --> 00:48:45,487
Dad?

498
00:48:49,450 --> 00:48:50,701
Dad?

499
00:48:53,203 --> 00:48:55,706
Dad? Where are you?

500
00:48:58,208 --> 00:49:01,295
I forgot how slow parents are.

501
00:49:01,337 --> 00:49:05,090
I thought my Ecto-Morphicons
would be dug up by now.

502
00:49:07,593 --> 00:49:10,095
Oh, Goldie, I'm bored.

503
00:49:11,347 --> 00:49:13,223
Let's have some fun. Hey, you!

504
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:16,977
Dance.

505
00:49:21,357 --> 00:49:23,233
Do the swim.

506
00:49:28,864 --> 00:49:31,367
Ballet!

507
00:49:40,125 --> 00:49:40,709
Hey.

508
00:49:40,751 --> 00:49:43,879
Hey, boss! They're back!

509
00:49:46,382 --> 00:49:47,633
Ah!

510
00:49:48,258 --> 00:49:49,510
My Tengu.

511
00:49:58,894 --> 00:50:02,022
Stop your screeching.

512
00:50:03,899 --> 00:50:07,611
- How did you fare?
- It couldn't have gone better.

513
00:50:07,653 --> 00:50:10,781
Threw one of 'em off a mountain,
one into a ragin' river.

514
00:50:11,407 --> 00:50:13,909
So, they've all been destroyed?

515
00:50:14,535 --> 00:50:17,037
- Well, we were about to destroy them, but...
- What?

516
00:50:17,663 --> 00:50:22,042
You didn't kill them? You call yourself Tengu
warriors? You're more like Tengu turkeys!

517
00:50:22,084 --> 00:50:25,129
I'll have you all stuffed and roasted!

518
00:50:25,170 --> 00:50:30,175
But, master, there was this monster with
these huge sticks and it kept twirling them...

519
00:50:30,217 --> 00:50:34,555
Sticks? Did these sticks
have a whistling sound?

520
00:50:35,180 --> 00:50:38,309
It was more like nails on a chalkboard.

521
00:50:38,350 --> 00:50:40,144
Dulcea.

522
00:50:40,185 --> 00:50:44,273
That miserable, manipulating,
loathsome she-devil of a witch!

523
00:50:44,273 --> 00:50:48,277
If she leads them to the great power,
everything will be ruined.

524
00:50:48,319 --> 00:50:53,324
- Do you want us to take another whack at it?
- How about takin' another quack at it?

525
00:50:57,077 --> 00:51:02,082
No time to waste. My Ecto-Morphicon
machines must be unearthed by sundown.

526
00:51:33,364 --> 00:51:35,866
It's time.

527
00:52:06,522 --> 00:52:10,234
Man, this jungle goes on for ever.

528
00:52:10,275 --> 00:52:14,655
We've gotta keep movin', guys.
Zordon's time is runnin' out.

529
00:52:37,344 --> 00:52:38,595
Dad!

530
00:52:41,098 --> 00:52:42,349
Dad!

531
00:52:42,975 --> 00:52:44,852
Hey, Dad!

532
00:52:45,477 --> 00:52:47,938
Dad, what's wrong with you?

533
00:52:47,980 --> 00:52:52,359
It's me - Fred.
Dad, we gotta get outta here!

534
00:52:52,401 --> 00:52:54,236
Hey, you!

535
00:52:56,113 --> 00:52:57,948
Get back to work!

536
00:52:57,990 --> 00:53:02,369
Yeah! Pick up those rocks!
Tote that barge! Lift that bale!

537
00:53:03,621 --> 00:53:06,081
Put your weak backs into it!

538
00:53:06,123 --> 00:53:09,251
Yeah, I had a weak back
about a week back.

539
00:53:13,631 --> 00:53:20,512
Feast your eyes on the exoskeleton
of the Barbaric Hornitor!

540
00:53:20,554 --> 00:53:23,599
The Dreaded Scorpitron
should be close by.

541
00:53:23,641 --> 00:53:27,394
Once my lovely little Ecto-Morphicon
machines are up and running,

542
00:53:28,020 --> 00:53:31,106
spreading ooze throughout the world,

543
00:53:31,148 --> 00:53:36,153
I shall annihilate Angel Grove,
and then... the universe!

544
00:53:37,404 --> 00:53:41,784
# We're takin' over the world!
We're takin' over the world #

545
00:53:57,424 --> 00:54:01,804
What is this place?
Looks like some kind of graveyard.

546
00:54:05,557 --> 00:54:11,188
I wonder what happened.
Personally, I'd rather not find out.

547
00:54:15,567 --> 00:54:18,696
- Welcome to Jurassic Park.
Very funny, Adam.

548
00:54:49,977 --> 00:54:51,854
Aisha, get outta there!

549
00:55:03,115 --> 00:55:04,992
Rocky!

550
00:55:11,248 --> 00:55:12,499
Uh-oh.

551
00:55:16,879 --> 00:55:18,756
Wait for me!

552
00:55:27,514 --> 00:55:29,391
- Tommy!
- Hang on!

553
00:55:30,643 --> 00:55:31,894
Tommy!

554
00:55:33,771 --> 00:55:36,273
All right, bonehead!

555
00:55:50,037 --> 00:55:52,539
- Tommy, hang on!
- Whoa! Whoa!

556
00:55:54,416 --> 00:55:56,293
Tommy!

557
00:55:58,170 --> 00:55:59,421
Whoa!

558
00:56:03,175 --> 00:56:05,678
Hold on tight, Tommy!

559
00:56:11,934 --> 00:56:15,688
Yo, fossil head!
I've got a bone to pick with you!

560
00:56:18,816 --> 00:56:20,693
Huh? Whoa!

561
00:56:24,446 --> 00:56:26,281
Are you OK?

562
00:56:26,323 --> 00:56:30,077
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Biology finally paid off for you, huh?

563
00:56:30,119 --> 00:56:33,831
We should get outta here
before he pulls himself together.

564
00:56:34,456 --> 00:56:35,708
Yeah.

565
00:56:51,932 --> 00:56:58,188
You there! Let's show a little
initiative! And you, get your rear in gear!

566
00:57:06,947 --> 00:57:10,075
Pick up the pace! We haven't got all day!

567
00:57:10,701 --> 00:57:15,080
- Hey, boss, construction is completed.
Yeah, when's lunch?

568
00:57:15,122 --> 00:57:18,208
Parents of Angel Grove!

569
00:57:18,834 --> 00:57:21,962
You have completed my Ecto-Morphicons!

570
00:57:22,588 --> 00:57:27,593
But, frankly, I'm sick of your ugly faces
and your dull personalities.

571
00:57:27,635 --> 00:57:29,428
Yeah!

572
00:57:29,470 --> 00:57:33,223
You will return to the construction site
and leap to your doom.

573
00:57:33,265 --> 00:57:35,100
- Leap to your doom.
- Bye-bye.

574
00:57:35,726 --> 00:57:37,936
Bye-bye!
Aloha!

575
00:57:37,936 --> 00:57:40,105
Arrivederci!

576
00:57:40,731 --> 00:57:42,566
- Dad!
Hasta la vista, baby.

577
00:57:42,608 --> 00:57:45,110
See ya! Wouldn't wanna be ya!

578
00:57:45,152 --> 00:57:46,362
Ciao.

579
00:57:48,238 --> 00:57:50,699
See ya later, alligator.

580
00:57:50,741 --> 00:57:55,120
Finally, the moment of truth!

581
00:57:56,372 --> 00:57:59,500
Mordant, let the ooze flow!

582
00:57:59,541 --> 00:58:02,002
Comin' right up.

583
00:58:12,638 --> 00:58:17,017
Ooze, give my creatures life!

584
00:58:17,059 --> 00:58:21,397
Life, I tell you! Life!

585
00:58:38,914 --> 00:58:40,165
Excellent!

586
00:58:48,299 --> 00:58:50,801
Now my machines will destroy the city!

587
00:59:11,613 --> 00:59:12,823
Wow.

588
00:59:12,865 --> 00:59:15,367
Hey, guys, check this out.

589
00:59:24,126 --> 00:59:26,003
Incredible.

590
00:59:37,264 --> 00:59:39,767
Let's go, guys. Nice and easy.

591
01:00:13,550 --> 01:00:14,802
What do you think?

592
01:00:15,427 --> 01:00:17,304
Wait here.

593
01:00:39,201 --> 01:00:40,452
Tommy!

594
01:01:07,354 --> 01:01:09,231
- What now?
- Ninjetti!

595
01:01:09,273 --> 01:01:11,108
- Falcon!
- The frog!

596
01:01:11,150 --> 01:01:13,319
- The ape!
- The crane!

597
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:15,487
- The wolf!
- Bear!

598
01:01:20,492 --> 01:01:22,369
These things are made of rock.

599
01:01:28,626 --> 01:01:30,502
These guys are strong.

600
01:01:49,271 --> 01:01:50,522
Yikes.

601
01:01:59,907 --> 01:02:01,784
Back off, boulder breath!

602
01:02:23,055 --> 01:02:24,932
Hang tight, Adam!

603
01:02:28,686 --> 01:02:29,937
Ever play leapfrog?

604
01:02:34,942 --> 01:02:36,819
- Adam!
- Hang on, Rocky!

605
01:02:41,824 --> 01:02:43,701
Hey, lava head!

606
01:02:49,331 --> 01:02:51,834
Thanks, Adam. Thought I was finished.

607
01:02:53,085 --> 01:02:54,962
That's one down, and three to go.

608
01:03:03,095 --> 01:03:04,346
Whoa!

609
01:03:06,223 --> 01:03:07,474
Somebody help!

610
01:03:11,854 --> 01:03:13,731
Let's talk about this.

611
01:03:14,356 --> 01:03:16,233
Guess not.

612
01:03:18,736 --> 01:03:20,946
Come on, roll!

613
01:03:20,946 --> 01:03:23,115
Hang on, Kimberly!

614
01:03:28,120 --> 01:03:31,248
They're strong, but they're not too smart.
Help me push.

615
01:03:31,290 --> 01:03:32,499
Right.

616
01:03:34,376 --> 01:03:36,253
Let's rock his world.

617
01:03:56,273 --> 01:03:58,776
What is this, pick-on-the-frog day?

618
01:04:02,529 --> 01:04:06,283
- Hey, Adam, could you use a hand?
- The thought crossed my mind.

619
01:04:06,909 --> 01:04:06,909
Adam!

620
01:04:11,288 --> 01:04:13,165
Elevator goin' up.

621
01:04:15,042 --> 01:04:16,919
Elevator goin' down.

622
01:04:18,170 --> 01:04:20,047
Talk about a splitting headache.

623
01:04:24,426 --> 01:04:25,052
Whoa! That was close.

624
01:04:32,559 --> 01:04:34,436
- All right. Ready?
- Yeah.

625
01:04:35,062 --> 01:04:36,313
Go!

626
01:04:40,693 --> 01:04:43,195
Ninjetti corkscrew kick!

627
01:04:49,451 --> 01:04:50,703
Eightball, corner pocket!

628
01:05:02,589 --> 01:05:04,425
What now?

629
01:05:04,466 --> 01:05:07,594
- Whoa. What's happening?
Look.

630
01:05:53,390 --> 01:05:55,893
The great power.

631
01:05:55,934 --> 01:05:58,395
The sacred animals.

632
01:06:28,425 --> 01:06:30,302
New Zords!

633
01:06:48,445 --> 01:06:50,322
- We did it!
- Our morphers are on line.

634
01:06:50,364 --> 01:06:52,199
- We got the power!
- Hang on, Zordon!

635
01:06:52,825 --> 01:06:54,702
- We're on our way.
- Let's do it.

636
01:07:07,214 --> 01:07:09,091
Good luck, Rangers.

637
01:07:23,480 --> 01:07:28,485
Citizens of Angel Grove,
how do you like my friends, huh?

638
01:07:54,762 --> 01:07:57,640
The boys are back in town!

639
01:07:57,681 --> 01:08:00,517
Long live the King of Ooze!

640
01:08:02,936 --> 01:08:05,397
The mayor has declared a state of emergency.

641
01:08:05,439 --> 01:08:09,193
He"s asked that the city
be immediately evacuated.

642
01:08:09,818 --> 01:08:11,654
Angel Grove has never before known...

643
01:08:11,695 --> 01:08:16,075
Aye-yai-yai-yai-yai! Ivan's evil machines
are destroying Angel Grove!

644
01:08:16,700 --> 01:08:18,577
Alpha...

645
01:08:19,203 --> 01:08:21,038
keep trying.

646
01:08:21,080 --> 01:08:23,582
Where are the Power Rangers?

647
01:08:27,336 --> 01:08:31,090
I love the smell of destruction in the evening.

648
01:08:31,131 --> 01:08:32,925
Me, too.

649
01:08:32,967 --> 01:08:34,843
What's that smell?

650
01:08:35,469 --> 01:08:38,597
Inconceivable.

651
01:08:39,223 --> 01:08:41,725
The Power Rangers!

652
01:08:47,356 --> 01:08:51,068
- Oh, man! Look at this mess.
- This is Ivan's handiwork.

653
01:08:51,110 --> 01:08:54,238
- Let's get back to the command centre.
- Wait. What was that?

654
01:08:54,280 --> 01:08:56,740
I think we're about to find out. Look!

655
01:09:02,371 --> 01:09:06,750
- Whoa. What is that thing?
- Ivan's been busy while we were away.

656
01:09:10,504 --> 01:09:11,755
Whoa!

657
01:09:14,258 --> 01:09:17,386
- What's that?
There's another one.

658
01:09:17,428 --> 01:09:19,888
And it's even uglier.

659
01:09:21,765 --> 01:09:24,226
- Whoa.
- We've gotta stop these things.

660
01:09:24,268 --> 01:09:28,022
- We've got new Ninja Zords. Let's use 'em!
- Right!

661
01:09:28,063 --> 01:09:29,898
Ninja crane Zord!

662
01:09:29,940 --> 01:09:31,483
Ninja wolf Zord!

663
01:09:31,525 --> 01:09:33,027
Ninja frog Zord!

664
01:09:33,652 --> 01:09:35,529
Ninja ape Zord!

665
01:09:35,571 --> 01:09:37,406
Ninja bear Zord!

666
01:09:37,448 --> 01:09:39,283
Ninja falcon Zord!

667
01:09:41,785 --> 01:09:43,662
Uh-oh!

668
01:09:51,795 --> 01:09:53,672
- Check it out!
- Ninja Zords!

669
01:09:54,298 --> 01:09:54,882
Cool!

670
01:09:54,923 --> 01:09:56,175
- Yes!
- Awesome!

671
01:10:03,057 --> 01:10:05,517
Oh, no! It's the Zords!

672
01:10:05,559 --> 01:10:09,021
Ah, Zords, schmords.
I'll crush 'em like roaches.

673
01:10:09,021 --> 01:10:12,441
- Let's do it!
- Right! Ninja Zords power up!

674
01:10:19,323 --> 01:10:21,158
Ready to ride. Yes!

675
01:10:21,200 --> 01:10:24,954
- All systems on line.
- Activating weapon systems.

676
01:10:24,995 --> 01:10:27,456
- Nice stereo.
- We're outta here!

677
01:10:41,845 --> 01:10:44,348
Leap to our doom.

678
01:10:44,974 --> 01:10:49,979
Leap to our doom.

679
01:10:51,855 --> 01:10:54,358
# Uh-oh, we're in trouble #

680
01:10:54,984 --> 01:10:57,486
# Something's come along
and it's burst our bubble #

681
01:10:58,112 --> 01:10:59,363
# Yeah, yeah #

682
01:11:08,122 --> 01:11:09,999
Hey, everyone!

683
01:11:15,004 --> 01:11:20,009
Listen up! You all think
this is one big party, don't you?

684
01:11:20,634 --> 01:11:23,762
- Yeah!
- Well, you've all been brainwashed.

685
01:11:24,388 --> 01:11:28,767
Ivan's taking over the planet
and he's using all of us in his plans!

686
01:11:28,809 --> 01:11:31,895
- And he's got our parents.
- What are you talking about?

687
01:11:31,937 --> 01:11:34,356
Look, Ivan Ooze is evil.

688
01:11:34,398 --> 01:11:40,029
And if you don't come with me right now, our
parents are gonna die! You gotta believe me!

689
01:11:43,157 --> 01:11:47,536
Rangers, I'm over the east quadrant.
My sensors are pickin' up a disturbance.

690
01:11:48,162 --> 01:11:50,039
I'm goin' in.

691
01:11:50,664 --> 01:11:53,792
Somebody call for an exterminator?
I've got a lock.

692
01:11:56,920 --> 01:11:58,797
Rockets away!

693
01:12:07,556 --> 01:12:09,391
I've been hit! I'm pullin' out!

694
01:12:09,433 --> 01:12:12,561
Don't worry, Tommy, Frog Zord is in position.

695
01:12:14,438 --> 01:12:16,273
We got 'em now, boss.

696
01:12:16,315 --> 01:12:20,069
Touch me again,
you'll be chicken wings in the morning.

697
01:12:24,448 --> 01:12:26,325
Tongue-tied and twisted.

698
01:12:26,367 --> 01:12:28,202
Yee-hah!

699
01:12:30,704 --> 01:12:35,084
Bad move, sparky.
You play with fire, you're gonna get burned.

700
01:12:40,714 --> 01:12:43,217
- I need backup!
I"m on my way!

701
01:12:45,719 --> 01:12:48,847
Wolf Zord approaching target.
Keep him tied up. I'm loading hydraulics.

702
01:12:49,473 --> 01:12:51,976
I'm losin' him!

703
01:12:52,017 --> 01:12:53,852
Here goes!

704
01:12:55,104 --> 01:12:57,606
All right! Got him.

705
01:13:04,488 --> 01:13:06,991
Time to boogie with the bear.

706
01:13:10,744 --> 01:13:11,996
Whoa!

707
01:13:12,621 --> 01:13:14,498
I've been hit hard!

708
01:13:16,375 --> 01:13:18,877
Ape Zord locked on target.

709
01:13:20,129 --> 01:13:22,631
Yee-hah!

710
01:13:23,257 --> 01:13:25,134
Ride 'em, cowboy!

711
01:13:29,513 --> 01:13:32,641
- Hang in there, Rocky!
- I'm hangin'! I'm hangin'!

712
01:13:33,892 --> 01:13:37,021
Come on! We'll take the monorail!

713
01:13:40,774 --> 01:13:43,277
Let's get down to the construction site!

714
01:13:55,789 --> 01:13:59,543
All right, guys,
I've got a lock on the ooze man.

715
01:14:00,794 --> 01:14:01,420
Ah!

716
01:14:02,046 --> 01:14:04,548
Here comes that cute
little Pink Ranger to the rescue.

717
01:14:05,174 --> 01:14:08,302
Oh, you think she's cute too, huh?

718
01:14:10,179 --> 01:14:14,558
- One order of toasted slime comin' up.
- So, you wanna play, huh?

719
01:14:19,563 --> 01:14:23,317
Ivan's got me in an electromagnetic deadlock!
I can't break free!

720
01:14:23,359 --> 01:14:25,819
Hang on, Kimberly!

721
01:14:27,071 --> 01:14:30,157
I'm getting airsick up here!

722
01:14:30,199 --> 01:14:33,953
My stabilisers have ruptured!
I can't hold on much longer!

723
01:14:35,829 --> 01:14:39,583
- I'm burning up in here!
Kimberly, use your thrusters!

724
01:14:40,209 --> 01:14:42,086
Right! Now, which button?

725
01:14:43,963 --> 01:14:45,214
Aaaaaggghhh!

726
01:14:46,465 --> 01:14:48,968
- I'll deal with you later.
- Yeah, later.

727
01:14:57,726 --> 01:14:58,978
Ah. Oozed.

728
01:15:02,106 --> 01:15:05,234
I'm losing my grip!
I can't hold on much longer!

729
01:15:08,362 --> 01:15:12,116
Falcon Zord is back in the game.
Adam, disengage. I've got a clear shot!

730
01:15:12,157 --> 01:15:13,993
He's all yours.

731
01:15:14,618 --> 01:15:17,746
All right, big guy, it's lights out for you.

732
01:15:18,998 --> 01:15:21,500
Rockets away!

733
01:15:30,259 --> 01:15:34,013
- He's outta there!
- Target neutralised. Let's get the other one.

734
01:15:36,515 --> 01:15:38,392
He's too strong! I can't take him down!

735
01:15:48,402 --> 01:15:50,904
Everybody close in. This street's a dead end.

736
01:15:52,781 --> 01:15:58,078
They've destroyed
my beautiful creation.

737
01:15:58,120 --> 01:16:03,417
Now I'm beginning to get really angry!

738
01:16:16,555 --> 01:16:18,724
Oh, I'm gonna be sick.

739
01:16:18,766 --> 01:16:20,934
I feel big again!

740
01:16:21,560 --> 01:16:24,063
Go get 'em, booger man!

741
01:16:27,816 --> 01:16:30,945
Whoa. Somebody call a plastic surgeon.

742
01:16:33,447 --> 01:16:35,908
Oh, no!

743
01:16:35,950 --> 01:16:37,826
I'm outta here!

744
01:16:42,206 --> 01:16:44,708
Time for a little swordplay.

745
01:16:49,713 --> 01:16:53,217
- He destroyed the monorail track.
- We need Ninja Megazord power now!

746
01:16:53,842 --> 01:16:56,345
Ninja Megazord, power up!

747
01:17:07,606 --> 01:17:10,734
Monorail's in trouble.
I'll complete docking sequence later.

748
01:17:10,776 --> 01:17:13,237
We"ll take care of Ivan.

749
01:17:17,616 --> 01:17:20,077
# Go, go, Power Rangers #

750
01:17:20,119 --> 01:17:23,247
# Mighty Morphin Power Rangers #

751
01:17:23,289 --> 01:17:25,124
Crane Zord locked on.

752
01:17:25,749 --> 01:17:26,959
Checking out.

753
01:17:27,001 --> 01:17:29,503
Ninja battle mode now!

754
01:17:33,882 --> 01:17:37,011
- Activating Ninja Megazord battle mode.
- Power Sword, now!

755
01:17:40,764 --> 01:17:42,641
Shall we tango?

756
01:17:48,897 --> 01:17:51,358
- Oh, no.
- What is that?

757
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:53,902
- The track's broken!
- Oh, no!

758
01:17:57,031 --> 01:17:58,907
Hang on, kids.

759
01:18:05,164 --> 01:18:08,917
- Falcon Zord is comin' in for a landin'.
- Everybody hang on!

760
01:18:14,548 --> 01:18:15,174
All right! Yeah! Whoo!

761
01:18:15,799 --> 01:18:18,927
Good luck, kids.

762
01:18:25,184 --> 01:18:27,061
Power Sword has been destroyed.

763
01:18:30,189 --> 01:18:33,275
- Pressure's dropping!
- Negative control!

764
01:18:33,317 --> 01:18:37,696
- Tommy, we need your help!
- Hang tight, guys. I'm on my way.

765
01:18:40,824 --> 01:18:44,578
- Everybody hang on!
Next stop, Angel Grove First National.

766
01:18:44,620 --> 01:18:45,788
Whoaaa!

767
01:18:45,829 --> 01:18:47,706
Brace for impact!

768
01:18:55,214 --> 01:18:57,091
- All systems down!
- He's closing in!

769
01:18:57,716 --> 01:19:01,470
- Tommy, get your butt down here!
- Comin' in to complete the sequence.

770
01:19:07,101 --> 01:19:08,352
Ninja Falcon Megazord!

771
01:19:11,480 --> 01:19:14,608
Let's get Ooze outta here
before he destroys everything.

772
01:19:14,650 --> 01:19:17,111
- I'll set a course for outer space.
- Good idea.

773
01:19:17,152 --> 01:19:18,362
Let's do it!

774
01:19:26,495 --> 01:19:29,623
You can run, but you can't hide.

775
01:19:30,874 --> 01:19:32,751
Yee-hah!

776
01:19:42,594 --> 01:19:43,846
Leap to our doom.

777
01:19:45,723 --> 01:19:48,225
Leap to our doom.

778
01:19:49,476 --> 01:19:51,353
Leap to our doom.

779
01:19:52,604 --> 01:19:54,481
Leap to our doom.

780
01:20:00,738 --> 01:20:02,615
It's our parents!

781
01:20:14,501 --> 01:20:18,881
You guys try and stop them.
And you two come with me.

782
01:20:33,896 --> 01:20:37,024
- Guys, I think I know a way to get rid of Ivan.
- Really? How?

783
01:20:37,066 --> 01:20:39,526
- Ryan's Comet.
- Billy, that's brilliant!

784
01:20:39,568 --> 01:20:42,029
- What?
- We get Ivan in the comet's path...

785
01:20:42,071 --> 01:20:44,490
And kaboom! He's space dust.

786
01:20:44,531 --> 01:20:47,034
- All right, guys, main thrusters.
- Right!

787
01:20:56,418 --> 01:21:00,172
- We can't hold 'em back!
- We have to keep on trying!

788
01:21:18,941 --> 01:21:21,443
Turn it on!

789
01:21:44,591 --> 01:21:47,720
Well, if it isn't that
double-dealing dough head!

790
01:21:48,345 --> 01:21:52,099
I hope those Rangers
put that lousy lowlife out of my misery!

791
01:21:52,141 --> 01:21:55,853
- Go, Rangers! Go, Rangers!
- Go, Rangers! Go, Rangers!

792
01:21:56,478 --> 01:21:59,606
We're approaching the comet's coordinates.

793
01:22:00,232 --> 01:22:03,360
All right, guys, this is it.
We'll wait here and lure him in.

794
01:22:03,402 --> 01:22:06,488
I'm gonna rip you apart Zord by Zord.

795
01:22:07,740 --> 01:22:10,242
Here he comes. Brace yourselves!

796
01:22:19,001 --> 01:22:21,795
- Micropressure's in the red!
- We're imploding!

797
01:22:21,837 --> 01:22:24,632
Bearing 009. We're in the comet's trajectory.

798
01:22:24,673 --> 01:22:25,841
We need to break free.

799
01:22:25,883 --> 01:22:29,011
Have you hugged your Zords today?

800
01:22:32,139 --> 01:22:35,267
- Here it comes!
- We have to break his grip!

801
01:22:35,893 --> 01:22:39,021
Desperate times
call for desperate measures.

802
01:22:39,063 --> 01:22:42,149
- What are you doing?
- Taking care of business.

803
01:22:46,528 --> 01:22:49,031
- We're outta here.
- Right!

804
01:22:54,036 --> 01:22:55,913
Oh, no.

805
01:23:20,312 --> 01:23:21,563
Yeah.

806
01:23:22,189 --> 01:23:24,066
- Skull!
- Bulk...

807
01:23:30,948 --> 01:23:32,199
Dad!

808
01:23:33,450 --> 01:23:35,327
- Fred!
- Dad!

809
01:23:45,337 --> 01:23:47,214
I love you, son.

810
01:23:56,223 --> 01:23:57,433
Alpha!

811
01:23:57,474 --> 01:24:00,561
Rangers, you made it!

812
01:24:00,602 --> 01:24:04,356
But... I'm afraid you're too late.

813
01:24:04,982 --> 01:24:06,859
Too late?

814
01:24:11,238 --> 01:24:13,115
This can't be happening.

815
01:24:40,643 --> 01:24:43,145
Remember what we learnt?

816
01:24:44,396 --> 01:24:48,776
To those who possess the great power,
all things are possible.

817
01:24:55,032 --> 01:24:57,534
Come on.

818
01:26:12,610 --> 01:26:14,153
Zordon!

819
01:26:14,194 --> 01:26:15,696
Rangers!

820
01:26:15,738 --> 01:26:18,824
He's alive! He's alive! He's alive!

821
01:26:18,866 --> 01:26:23,245
- We thought that you had...
- It is good to see you again, too.

822
01:26:33,547 --> 01:26:35,424
We were awesome.
Incredible!

823
01:26:36,050 --> 01:26:38,552
Ivan and his 50-foot monsters
had us surrounded.

824
01:26:39,178 --> 01:26:42,598
- There was no escape.
- We knew we were facing death in the eye.

825
01:26:42,640 --> 01:26:46,060
- We could smell death's breath.
- And death could use a mint.

826
01:26:46,101 --> 01:26:47,936
Can you believe those guys?

827
01:26:48,562 --> 01:26:51,065
I'm so hungry.

828
01:26:51,690 --> 01:26:53,567
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Fred!

829
01:26:54,193 --> 01:26:57,947
- Hey! Rumour has it you're quite the hero.
- That's my man!

830
01:26:57,988 --> 01:27:01,659
I helped a bit.
The Power Rangers did most of the work.

831
01:27:01,700 --> 01:27:06,664
Hey, things got tough, you didn't panic.
You, my friend, demonstrated true bravery.

832
01:27:06,705 --> 01:27:11,085
It's like what you taught me about martial
arts: use your head, and above all, stay calm.

833
01:27:11,126 --> 01:27:14,838
I heard you're in line to be
a Ranger yourself one of these days.

834
01:27:14,880 --> 01:27:19,843
- Nah, that's impossible.
- Hey, anything's possible.

835
01:27:19,885 --> 01:27:22,972
- You really think so?
- I know so.

836
01:27:24,848 --> 01:27:29,853
- Fred Kelman, the Silver Ranger.
- It does have a certain ring to it.

837
01:27:31,730 --> 01:27:34,233
Fred Kelman the Gold Ranger.

838
01:27:38,612 --> 01:27:39,863
Check it out!

839
01:27:41,115 --> 01:27:43,617
# We'll get higher and higher #

840
01:27:43,659 --> 01:27:46,120
# Straight up we'll climb #

841
01:27:47,371 --> 01:27:50,499
# We'll get higher and higher #

842
01:27:51,125 --> 01:27:53,627
# Leave it all behind #

843
01:27:56,130 --> 01:27:59,258
# So, baby, dry your eyes #

844
01:27:59,883 --> 01:28:02,386
- All right!
- I don't believe it.

845
01:28:06,765 --> 01:28:09,268
- Power Rangers?
- Bulk and Skull!

846
01:28:09,893 --> 01:28:12,980
# Cos we belong #

847
01:28:13,022 --> 01:28:16,150
# In a world that must be strong #

848
01:28:16,775 --> 01:28:21,905
# Oh, that's what dreams are made of #

849
01:28:23,157 --> 01:28:30,039
# Oh, that's what dreams are made of #

850
01:29:11,330 --> 01:29:13,832
I am King Goldar,

851
01:29:14,458 --> 01:29:16,961
the ruler of the universe!

852
01:29:24,468 --> 01:29:25,719
Uh-oh.
