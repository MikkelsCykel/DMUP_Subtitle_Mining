1
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,900
Billy?
Get number three up now.

2
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,600
And don't come in to eat
before you do.

3
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:07,900
And check the other two!

4
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,800
Make sure they're wired up good!

5
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,800
I don't want 'em blowing over
again at the first big wind.

6
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:24,000
Lot of good they're doing.

7
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,300
Billy, you been messing
with the post-puncher?

8
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,800
No!

9
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,700
I told you what would happen...

10
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,300
if you screw around
with this thing.

11
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,300
I said I didn't!

12
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,100
"l don't want 'em
blowin' down again."

13
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,300
Big wind, my ass.

14
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,900
You're the only big wind
out here.

15
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,800
Jacky!

16
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,800
You been messing with the damn
post-puncher again, huh?

17
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
No.

18
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,800
Billy, you little asshole!

19
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,500
Why don't you rat yourself out
for a change?

20
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:32,200
-What did I do?
-You little butt sniff!

21
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,100
I ought to come out there
and kick your ass!

22
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,100
You wish!

23
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:57,400
Yeah, go on, Mac. Go bite him
in the ass for me, Mackie boy.

24
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,000
God, would you shut up?

25
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,800
Jacky!

26
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,300
Jacky!

27
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,900
Jacky!

28
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,000
Jacky!

29
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,300
-What?
-I don't know.

30
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:11,900
What?

31
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:23,700
Help!

32
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,100
Billy!

33
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,400
Help! Help!

34
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:32,300
Where are you? Billy!

35
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,300
Daddy!

36
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,000
Billy!

37
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,700
Let go! Help me, dad!

38
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:49,400
-Billy!
-Help! Help! Help!

39
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:53,600
-Billy!
-Help! Dad! Help me!

40
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,700
Billy!

41
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,800
Stop it! Let go!

42
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,500
-Billy!
-Daddy!

43
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:06,600
Billy!

44
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:11,200
Help!

45
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,800
Bannon Bantams! Bannon Bantams!

46
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,100
-Go!
-Louder!

47
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,400
-Go!
-Louder!

48
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:00,700
Go Bantams! Yeah! Whoo! Yeah!

49
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,200
Tough as nails, hard as rocks!

50
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,500
We are Bannon's fighting cocks!

51
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,800
Fighting Bantams,
tough as nails!

52
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,800
Bow down now or kiss our tails!

53
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,100
Out for blood,
we're lean and mean!

54
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:15,300
Bannon County's death machine!

55
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,400
Bannon Bantams! Bannon Bantams!

56
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,700
Go Bantams!

57
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:22,300
Bannon Bantams, power and might!

58
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,500
Bannon Bantams,
fight, fight, fight!

59
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,600
Incoming!

60
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,400
Bannon Bantams, we're the word!

61
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,700
You don't mess
with a mighty bird!

62
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,800
Down the court
we'll clean your clock!

63
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:33,100
Better not mess
with the fighting cock!

64
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:35,100
Bannon Bantams, Bannon Bantams!

65
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:37,000
Go Bantams!

66
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,300
Bannon Bantams, wings of steel!

67
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,400
Bannon Bantams,
kill, kill, kill!

68
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,500
Who was that? Don't even ask!

69
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,800
Big bad Bantams kick your ass!

70
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,000
Bannon Bantams, Bannon Bantams!

71
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,100
Go Bantams!

72
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,700
Go!

73
00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:00,300
Go Bantams!

74
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,500
We are the champs!
We are the champs!

75
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,500
Tough as nails, hard as rocks!
We are Bannon's fighting cocks!

76
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,700
How long can they keep this up?

77
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:17,100
Forever. They have a fight song
with the word "cock" in it.

78
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:19,700
Why aren't you sitting
with your honey?

79
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,900
Bannon County's death machine!

80
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,100
Someone should tell him he just
won the state championship.

81
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:29,500
I have a feeling
he didn't get to play enough.

82
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,500
Well, shouldn't you be
sitting with him?

83
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:35,900
After a game, he says
he needs to be with the guys.

84
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:38,200
You'd kill
his post-game bus high.

85
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:42,400
Basically. If they lose,
it's a totally different thing.

86
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,100
Can't pry him off me.

87
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,900
Shit.

88
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,300
OK, everybody sit down.
Sit tight.

89
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,800
Son of a bitch!

90
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,300
What in the hell
would you call that?

91
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,000
I don't know,
but whatever it is...

92
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,900
it's sharp as a son of a bitch.

93
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,500
What in the hell
are we looking at?

94
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:54,100
Sharp enough to flatten a tire,
whatever it is.

95
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,700
You know how thick
that rubber is?

96
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:58,300
Have to be shot into it
like a bullet.

97
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:01,000
Jesus Christ! The damn thing
has got teeth in it!

98
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,900
They can't just whip the jack
out and pump this mother up?

99
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:06,200
The driver can't change a flat
on a bus.

100
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,300
-They need a mechanic.
-So?

101
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:12,300
So, do you see
any mechanics around here?

102
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,900
You sucked so bad today,
Deaundre...

103
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,400
they're probably saying
you gotta change the flat.

104
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,200
...where she'll
give us the latest update...

105
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:23,100
-lzzy!
-on a continuing story...

106
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:26,100
we call
"The Horror in Poho County."

107
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:28,000
Hey, Poho update!

108
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,700
Well, Peter,
the fire which gutted...

109
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:32,300
an old church south
of Pertwilla four days ago...

110
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:35,000
continues to offer up
a gruesome bounty.

111
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,500
County sheriffs
excavating the charred ruins...

112
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:41,000
say the body count is now up
well past three hundred.

113
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,600
County coroners
say the bodies were found...

114
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,000
stitched to each other...

115
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,700
covering the basement's
walls and ceiling.

116
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,800
One on-the-scene witness
called it...

117
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,100
"a human tapestry
of torture and sadism"...

118
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,900
and "a sight
he will never forget."

119
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,800
Sheila,
the details keep getting...

120
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:00,200
stranger and stranger
every day this week, it seems.

121
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,400
Any new information?

122
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,300
Some of the corpses
they have found...

123
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,600
had false teeth
made out of wood.

124
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,900
That means some of the bodies
they're finding down there...

125
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:10,200
are over two hundred years old.

126
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,600
But, Peter, it's
the condition of the cadavers...

127
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,800
that's
the strangest fact of all.

128
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,300
The county coroner's office
reported yesterday...

129
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:20,400
that they have yet to find
any one complete body.

130
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:23,000
-Believe that, man?
-No, they're making it up.

131
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,200
...missing an external limb
or an internal organ.

132
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,700
What connection this has--

133
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:31,100
This is 226, out on east 9.

134
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:33,900
We are down and disabled.
Home base, do you read me?

135
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:36,600
You get a good look
at the points on this thing?

136
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,500
It's either ivory
or some kind of bone.

137
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,200
Throw that damn thing away
before you need a tetanus shot.

138
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,700
This is Betty Gorman out on 226.

139
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:55,300
We are down and disabled
out on east 9.

140
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,600
Pop!

141
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:50,000
Pop, it dropped something!

142
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,400
Pop?

143
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:02,000
It was out in the corn, papa.

144
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,600
Here, look at it.

145
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:26,900
We are out on east 9. We are
down and disabled. Come back.

146
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:31,100
-What about Kimball, man?
-Say again.

147
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:33,800
This is 226. Anyone read me?

148
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,300
We are down and disabled
out on east 9. Come back.

149
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:45,200
We gotta be in some kind of
sun spot or something.

150
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,800
There's no signal getting out.

151
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,300
It's going to be dark
in about an hour.

152
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,700
Well, we still got five tires
on the ground which means...

153
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:54,700
we can probably limp home
if we keep the going slow.

154
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:00,900
Say again, this is 226.
Anyone read me?

155
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,500
All of you at the same time?

156
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,300
Lady cheerleaders!

157
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,600
That's not smoke I smell,
is it?

158
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,600
Minxie...

159
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,800
there's not a girl
in the world these days...

160
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,800
stupid enough
to kill themselves...

161
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,200
by sucking on cancer sticks,
am I right?

162
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,200
Back on the bus, ladies.

163
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,100
You saw me, right?

164
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:44,200
Run that fast break? Huh?
You see that?

165
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,100
-Yeah, I saw it.
-Anybody gonna read about it?

166
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,800
Why do you give ol' Dante
back there so much ink, huh?

167
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,800
I'm serious.

168
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:58,400
People are starting to think
that you're sweet on him.

169
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,400
Really? I heard that was you.

170
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,100
Hey, it's OK if you are, man.

171
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,400
I mean,
live and let love, right?

172
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,900
Why don't you piss
on somebody else's shoes, Jake?

173
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,600
Shouldn't you be
folding towels somewhere...

174
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:09,800
or sniffing jockstraps?

175
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:12,200
You think you can manage
the team, super genius?

176
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,600
Was I even talking to you,
jockstrap boy?

177
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,400
Hey, eat shit, Jake! God!

178
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,300
So this is all because, what,
I don't write enough about you?

179
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:24,100
You know what the story is
on your scars there, right?

180
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,300
No, tell me.

181
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,800
Got into a fight
when you snuck into a bar.

182
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:30,000
So?

183
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:31,400
A gay bar, bro.

184
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:37,100
You do know what they call you,
don't you, lzzy?

185
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,900
That's my name.

186
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,800
"Or isn't he?"

187
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,000
Hey, let's not make this...

188
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,600
a social event out there,
everybody.

189
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,800
Back on the bus, gentlemen.
We're moving!

190
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:55,200
Big K,
does that come in a man size?

191
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,800
That means you, too, Kimball!
Let's go!

192
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,800
Smooth move, Big K! Nice, man!

193
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,400
Tippi Hedren, man!

194
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,600
Kimball!
Stop clowning around...

195
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,300
and get your ass
back on the bus!

196
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,800
Off the top, gentlemen.

197
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,300
Assholes and elbows. Let's go.

198
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:07,600
Damn!

199
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,900
You know,
you could talk about it.

200
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,700
It might help a little bit.

201
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:02,300
What did I play today,
twelve minutes?

202
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:05,600
Well, it was
a great twelve minutes.

203
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:08,600
Hanna's got it in for me--

204
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,500
him and his little
token white boy Barnes.

205
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:15,900
I don't know...

206
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:19,100
maybe I got the wrong skin color
to get equal play on this team.

207
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,400
I know you don't mean that.

208
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,700
Maybe they just wanted
to make sure...

209
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,200
everyone got a chance to play
in the championship.

210
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,300
Everyone's not the reason why
we made it to the championship.

211
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,100
Half the losers on this bus
had nothing to do with...

212
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:34,900
us making it to state--I did.

213
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,700
What the fuck
are you looking at?

214
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:48,300
Oh, Jesus Christ!

215
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,000
Aw, don'ttell me.

216
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:15,600
-We blew the other one.
-How?

217
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:18,100
Back down, everybody. Sit tight.

218
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:20,600
Shit. We better
break out the flares...

219
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,400
and get these kids off the bus.

220
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,500
Hey, hey, hey!

221
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,500
You want to sit in here
and hope somebody doesn't...

222
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,900
come along, plowing into us
doing ninety, huh?

223
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,500
All right, Duane...

224
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:35,800
you clear the bus,
I'll set the flares.

225
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,200
What is that, a flare gun?

226
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:43,200
You plan on being lost at sea
in this thing?

227
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:44,900
You making fun of my lockbox?

228
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:46,100
'Cause everything
in this thing...

229
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,300
has saved my sweet ass
at least once.

230
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:52,200
Oh, I don't believe it.

231
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,500
All right, bring your coats
and stay in a group.

232
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,800
This is Betty Borman,
out on 226.

233
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:08,300
We're broke down on east 9...

234
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,800
middle of Kissel County.
Anyone read me?

235
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,200
Want me to help you push it
off the road before I go?

236
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,700
I don't think we can move it.
It's on a bare rim in the back.

237
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:18,700
If you'd let the highway patrol
know, we'd appreciate it.

238
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:20,200
Sure.

239
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,800
Come on, guys.

240
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:37,800
Come on, let's go. Off the road.

241
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:42,400
Come on, guys.

242
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:46,600
Everyone on the shoulder.
Everyone stays in a group.

243
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,700
Over by the side of the fence.

244
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:55,000
Scott, come on!

245
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:05,900
Everyone stays back
and off the road! Now!

246
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,900
Stuck in the side
of the tire again.

247
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:18,900
Oh, God. Don't tell me...

248
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:21,300
that's a belly button
in the middle of that thing.

249
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,200
Minxie, stay off the road.

250
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,000
Everybody, off the road!

251
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,600
Get everyone back on the bus.

252
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,800
-You just said they shouldn't--
-I know what I just said...

253
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,900
but there's something going on
out here, and I don't like it.

254
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,000
I think if we just st--

255
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:08,300
Coach?

256
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,700
What the f...

257
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:21,900
Where the hell's the coach?

258
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:24,100
Charlie?

259
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,000
Charlie!

260
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:45,300
Get everyone back inside
and close the doors.

261
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:48,000
OK, champions,
getting back on the Betty Boop.

262
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:50,600
Bucky, get on the two-way,
see if you can raise anyone.

263
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,600
-I'm talking to you, Scotty!
-What happened to the coach?

264
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:55,900
Get everyone back onboard
and close those doors.

265
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:00,600
Do it, Scotty.

266
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,100
All right, you heard him.

267
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:10,400
Assholes and elbows.
Everybody back on the bus.

268
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:13,800
Charlie?

269
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,700
Charlie?

270
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:24,200
Hurry up!
On the bus! Now, now, now!

271
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,200
I repeat, bus number 226...

272
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,900
Charlie!

273
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:29,900
We have an emergency situation
out here.

274
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:31,300
Does anybody read me?

275
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:37,900
This is bus number 226.
We are broke down on east 9.

276
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:18,200
Jake...

277
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
What happened?

278
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,400
-What did you see?
-What did you see?

279
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,900
Come on!
Did you see something or not?

280
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,500
She flew away.

281
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,600
What the fuck
is that supposed to mean?

282
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:44,600
-What I just said!
-People don't fly away!

283
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:45,900
Sit down, Scott!

284
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:47,200
What the hell's going on
out there?

285
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:50,300
I said sit the fuck down
and shut up, god damn it! Now!

286
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:57,500
You, too, Jake. Everybody.

287
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,500
Go sit down, Scott.

288
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:13,100
-You got a problem with me?
-No. You got one with me?

289
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:15,300
-Do I what?
-You heard me.

290
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:18,800
We don't have time for bullshit,
Scotty. Go sit down!

291
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,800
Oh, God!

292
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,200
What the hell?

293
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,100
Scotty!

294
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,500
What the fuck?

295
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,600
Get the fucking doors!
Get the fucking doors!

296
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,800
Get the fucking doors!

297
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:31,800
What was it?

298
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:37,000
Scotty, what the fuck was it?

299
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:40,400
-Scotty, come on!
-Scotty, we just want to know.

300
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,500
I don't know what it was,
all right?

301
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,300
It had wings--

302
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:01,900
big fucking wings.

303
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:28,800
Central, this is unit 17.

304
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
We did a drive-by
in the general area.

305
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:34,700
Also found no evidence
of forced entry. Over.

306
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,300
0-3-2,
we're 10-7 at Opper's Diner...

307
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:40,900
for a little coffee and pie.
Copy that, central?

308
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:44,200
This is central.
Copy that, 0-3-6.

309
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,400
All units,
anybody else getting...

310
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,000
some weird stuff
out Kissel County way?

311
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,800
I just got two calls,
ten miles apart...

312
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,900
both reporting abductions.

313
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:58,300
All units,
be informed this should be...

314
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:01,700
strictly 10-36 information.

315
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:04,500
Someone burning a marijuana
field out there tonight?

316
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:07,300
'Cause these two stories
are way, way out.

317
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,200
Roger that, 3-6. Come back.

318
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,400
Jacky! Kissel County!

319
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,100
If you ask me,
this is Poho related.

320
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:14,700
Repeat--Poho related.

321
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,400
You all know
what I'm talking about.

322
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:21,200
This is Andy Buck.
Can anybody hear me?

323
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,700
Nobody's phone works.
Nobody's fucking phone works.

324
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:26,600
We are stuck
in a broken-down school bus...

325
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:29,800
out on east 9,
and we are in serious trouble.

326
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:32,000
Do you read me?

327
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:38,200
Fuck! Come on!
Is anybody even out there?

328
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:39,500
This is Andy Buck!

329
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:44,700
We're stuck in a broken-down
school bus out on east 9!

330
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,100
Javelins?

331
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:49,300
We've got spears on this bus?

332
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:50,900
Sticks.

333
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,300
You want to wait around...

334
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:54,100
so you can poke at that thing
with sticks?

335
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:55,400
That thing
shows up here again...

336
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,800
I'd rather have a sharp stick
in my hand than nothing at all.

337
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,200
Hey, guys! Betty's flare gun.

338
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,000
Abunch offlaresforit,too!

339
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:06,200
Who says we wait around?
I'm serious.

340
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:09,900
Scotty, you're not talking
about getting off this bus.

341
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:12,000
You see that?

342
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:15,900
That means
that there's a farm...

343
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,200
down at the end of this road
somewhere...

344
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,600
and that's as far as
anybody'd have to get to.

345
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:25,300
With that thing out there?

346
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:30,100
Scotty,
with that thing out there?

347
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,100
Scotty!

348
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:34,800
That thing hasn't been
back here in almost an hour.

349
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
That doesn't mean it's not
still up there somewhere.

350
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,400
And that doesn't mean
that it is.

351
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,600
Hey, this isn't about
who can run the fastest, OK?

352
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,000
-Or being a pussy.
-What is your problem?

353
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,000
-You tell me, lzzy or isn't he?
-Check yourselves, both of you!

354
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:46,100
Do I make you nervous?

355
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,400
Thinking you're going
to come onto me...

356
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:49,500
and every other swinging dick
on this bus makes me nervous.

357
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:51,500
Yeah, it makes you
fucking stupid, too!

358
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:54,900
Scotty, stop it!

359
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:57,400
Stop it!

360
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,900
Scotty, come on.

361
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,400
You get that hand off of me...

362
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,100
or we're gonna have one more
missing person out here.

363
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,000
There's nothing about
any of us on this bus...

364
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,900
that's more important
than sticking together.

365
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:13,500
It's the only way
we're going to get through this.

366
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:16,200
You want to play
cock of the walk now, huh?

367
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,700
Now's not the time
for this shit, Scotty.

368
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,300
-Big K, sit.
-I'm serious.

369
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:24,400
You want to play
cock of the walk, bro?

370
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:30,300
Why do I think you want
to call me something else?

371
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:35,900
You want to call me
something else, Scotty?

372
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:37,200
'Cause I don't think you get...

373
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:40,100
I can see you thinking it
whether you say it or not.

374
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:43,900
Just stop it right now.
Both of you, stop it!

375
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,100
You guys all worked together
today to win a ball game.

376
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,400
Now that something
really serious happens...

377
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:53,400
you can't even be civil
to each other?

378
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,800
You tell him, not me.

379
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,800
Whatever your trip is,
we ain't got time for this shit.

380
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
We should all be
looking for ways...

381
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,500
we can defend ourselves
until help gets here.

382
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,700
We have got to move
this piece of shit!

383
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:11,900
On what, the rim?

384
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:13,100
Can you drive this thing or not?

385
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,600
We wouldn't get two feet, man!
What do you want me to do?

386
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:31,800
What the hell does it want?

387
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:39,900
What the fuck?
Is it looking at me?

388
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:50,800
Whatever it is,
it's a smell freak, man.

389
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:07,600
Get that light off him.

390
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:15,400
Hey, don't shoot
that thing in here, man!

391
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:18,000
He's right. It'll fill this
place up like a smokebomb.

392
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:21,300
Holy shit!

393
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:23,800
Did that just come off the door?

394
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Bucky, get on those front doors
and get ready to open them.

395
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,900
What, you think
we're gonna run outside?

396
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:30,800
If he fucking comes inside.

397
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:34,400
Oh, shit!

398
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,800
Oh, my God!

399
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:54,600
Minxie?

400
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,800
Minxie?

401
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:05,700
Is she OK?

402
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:09,000
Minxie. Minxie.

403
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,400
Minxie?

404
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,700
Minxie?

405
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,200
He eats everything.

406
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:16,900
-He knows no mercy.
-No one is safe.

407
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:34,100
Every 23rd spring,
for 23 days, it gets to eat.

408
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:40,100
Eat what?

409
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,600
Eat what?

410
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:49,800
Eat us.

411
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:04,900
Minx?

412
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:10,100
Are you OK?

413
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:12,400
Look at me.

414
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:16,300
I thought you were gone, girl.
You passed out. Look at me.

415
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:18,200
Are you OK?

416
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:21,700
Your eyes went all the way
in the back of your head.

417
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:24,800
I think he's gone, man.
I'm willing to bet money on it.

418
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:27,400
You willing to bet
stepping off this bus?

419
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:29,700
Because that's the real bet.

420
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:32,100
How long's it been?

421
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:35,300
It's gone. It came,
it did its thing, it went away.

422
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:37,100
It went away,
but what the hell was it doing?

423
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:39,000
What do you think it was doing?

424
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:47,500
It was picking people out.

425
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:54,000
What?

426
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:58,400
It can smell something
in people, in their fear--

427
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:01,100
something that helps it
pick people out.

428
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,500
Pick people out for what?

429
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:07,400
I don't understand how
you would know that, sweetie.

430
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:12,300
A dead boy told me.

431
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:19,900
I think
he was trying to warn me.

432
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:22,400
He was trying to warn
all of us...

433
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:26,100
that this thing has been around
for thousands of years...

434
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:27,900
and that nothing
has been able to kill it.

435
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:29,600
This is a dream you had?

436
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:30,700
Well, the boy was dead,
so, yes...

437
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:32,300
I am assuming
that it was a dream, Scotty.

438
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:34,200
You were waving pom-poms
at people this morning.

439
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:35,600
Now all of a sudden
you're a psychic hotline?

440
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:36,800
I don't know!

441
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:39,800
You want to explain it to me?
Because I can't.

442
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:48,600
The boy was trying to warn us...

443
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:51,800
that by morning it has
to go back into the earth.

444
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,600
Oh, come on.

445
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:56,900
Into the ground
for twenty-three more years.

446
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:03,100
And then what?
Lives happily ever after? Huh?

447
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:05,300
Why don't you clean out
your bong, all right?

448
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:06,900
Scotty, just listen to her.

449
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:08,200
It is coming back.

450
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:10,600
This is a dream she had, Rhonda.
Are you going to believe it?

451
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,800
And it doesn't matter
if we're hiding on this bus...

452
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,400
or if we're hiding
under our beds.

453
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:17,400
It'll find us--

454
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,800
the ones that it picked out.

455
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:39,900
Minx, take it easy, OK?

456
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:47,100
The boy told me that...

457
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:51,800
it can smell in our fear
who it wants...

458
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:56,700
and what from them...

459
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:58,000
it wants to eat.

460
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:14,400
Hello. Is anyone out there?

461
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:18,300
Hello. We have
a serious problem out here.

462
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:21,000
We need help right away.
Can anybody hear me?

463
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:24,700
Is anybody out there, please?

464
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:27,100
We have a--
This is Andy Buck.

465
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:28,700
We have a serious situation
out here.

466
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:30,800
Is anybody out there?

467
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,400
Does anybody hear me?

468
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:42,500
Dad!

469
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:47,500
Hello? Hello? Can you hear me?

470
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:51,000
-226, are you still there?
-I'm so fucking still here.

471
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:53,800
OK, OK. Just say again
what you just told me.

472
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,400
We're not playing games here,
right?

473
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:56,700
Just say it, man.

474
00:46:56,800 --> 00:47:01,900
We are trapped in a broken-down
school bus out on east 9...

475
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:03,900
and something
is going to kill us...

476
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:05,900
if we don't get help
out here right away.

477
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:08,100
Where on 9 east?

478
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:10,100
In Kissel County.
Are you the cops?

479
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:13,200
What's trying to kill you?
What are you talking about?

480
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:15,500
Just tell me,
are you the fucking cops?

481
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:19,300
Look, now listen to me.
I'm already on the 9...

482
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:21,600
but it's a big highway
and so is Kissel County.

483
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:23,800
Are there any landmarks
near you?

484
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,200
Are you close to anything?

485
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:27,700
Yeah, I'm close to peeing
in my fucking pants, man.

486
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:30,000
Can you just please tell me
that you're on the way?

487
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:33,700
I can't really judge
the strength of your signal...

488
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:36,000
but it doesn't sound close.

489
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:37,600
What does that mean, man?

490
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:40,100
It means it's going to take me
a while to get to you.

491
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:43,300
Look, we kind of have
a time-critical situation here.

492
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:45,600
Roger that.

493
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:47,600
And please tell me that
you're coming with backup...

494
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:49,400
because
if you're not the cops...

495
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:51,500
you got to promise me
that you'll call them...

496
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:54,600
and you'll tell them
that we're stuck out here.

497
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:58,300
I'll call them.
I'll call them right now...

498
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:00,100
but what you've got to do
is hang on.

499
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:03,300
Can you do that? Hang on.

500
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:15,900
Keep headed east.

501
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:22,300
Dad?

502
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:24,400
Just get us out there.

503
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:28,900
Do it.

504
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:49,500
Yes!

505
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:03,900
It's fucking happening, man!
It's fucking happening!

506
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,400
We're being fucking rescued!

507
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:11,300
Help me! Get this thing off me!

508
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:19,900
Help! Help! Get this thing off!

509
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:24,700
Help me! Get this thing off me!

510
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:26,200
Look out!

511
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:25,700
Half its fuckin' head's gone.

512
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:42,300
Fuck.

513
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:15,200
-You gotta be...
-Fucking kiddin' me.

514
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:05,700
Get that door open.
Now's our chance.

515
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:10,100
It's dead, right?

516
00:54:10,300 --> 00:54:12,000
Don't know. Don't care.

517
00:54:12,100 --> 00:54:13,500
It won't open!

518
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:23,100
Stop pushin' on 'em!
They open in!

519
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,700
Something got screwed up!

520
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:29,400
The door opens.

521
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:37,800
Maybe it only opens
from the outside.

522
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,200
It's an emergency exit, idiot.

523
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:41,500
Then you fuckin' open it, man!

524
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:43,500
Get that door open.

525
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:57,400
How can both fuckin' exits
not fuckin' work?

526
00:54:57,700 --> 00:55:00,300
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

527
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:01,600
He jammed it.

528
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:05,800
We thought
it was trying to come in...

529
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:07,400
but this frickin' thing
was making sure...

530
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:09,300
we couldn't get out.

531
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:20,000
Break the fuckin' doors!

532
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:00,800
Holy shit, man.

533
00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:10,000
Hey, we can
pry this thing open.

534
00:56:12,700 --> 00:56:16,100
Give me a pole or a bar or
something metal--something big.

535
00:56:16,300 --> 00:56:18,800
Yeah, yeah. That'll work.

536
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:33,200
Come on, D.
You need to get to this side.

537
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:35,000
Come on, everybody. Come on.

538
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:41,400
This thing's like
a fuckin' shower curtain, man.

539
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:42,800
It's crazy.

540
00:56:47,100 --> 00:56:49,300
Oh, man,
show like you got a pair.

541
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:51,800
Man, fuck you.

542
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,700
Come on.

543
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:56,800
Everybody, let's go.

544
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:09,700
Shower curtain?

545
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:11,500
This thing's like
a fucking piece of toilet paper.

546
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:36,000
What's it doing, Minx?

547
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:38,700
What's it doing, Minx?

548
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:41,500
What's it doing up there?

549
00:59:13,900 --> 00:59:15,300
It just tore its head off.

550
01:00:38,900 --> 01:00:40,300
It's time to go.

551
01:00:43,700 --> 01:00:45,600
What are you talking about,
man? Help is coming.

552
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:49,000
The 9 is big. Remember?

553
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:53,500
What if he's an hour away?

554
01:00:53,700 --> 01:00:55,600
What's if he's going
in the wrong direction?

555
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:57,500
There are fucking cops
on the way, man.

556
01:00:57,700 --> 01:00:58,800
And you want the rest of us...

557
01:00:58,900 --> 01:01:00,300
to sit underneath
that big hole in the roof...

558
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:03,100
and hope that thing
doesn't come crashing in here?

559
01:01:04,900 --> 01:01:06,500
What do you mean,
the rest of us?

560
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:08,600
I mean...

561
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:11,800
it's time to stop being polite.

562
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:15,500
There are two classes
of people on this bus now.

563
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:18,700
It had its pick
of twenty of us back there...

564
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:20,000
and it picked who?

565
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:23,400
Dante was one.

566
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,400
Another one was you, Jake.

567
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:28,100
Oh, god damn it, Scott.
Don't--

568
01:01:28,300 --> 01:01:30,900
And we all saw him
go for you, Bucky.

569
01:01:31,100 --> 01:01:34,100
What the hell
is that supposed to mean, huh?

570
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:36,300
Two classes of people?

571
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:39,100
What, the "will be eaten"
and the "won't be eaten"?

572
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:40,800
Fuck you, Scotty.

573
01:01:42,100 --> 01:01:43,500
Minxie says this thing...

574
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:45,300
gets anybody it picks out,
no matter what.

575
01:01:45,500 --> 01:01:47,200
Don't put me in this.

576
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:49,100
She also said
that after tonight...

577
01:01:49,300 --> 01:01:51,700
it goes away,
and for a long time, Scott.

578
01:01:51,900 --> 01:01:54,600
You tell us, Minxie.

579
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:57,300
Are we safe if we can hide out
till morning...

580
01:01:57,500 --> 01:01:59,500
or is this thing
gonna come after these guys...

581
01:01:59,700 --> 01:02:03,000
with everything it's got
'cause it only has till morning?

582
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:08,300
Huh?

583
01:02:13,300 --> 01:02:14,600
We're screwed, right?

584
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:21,500
Yeah.

585
01:02:21,700 --> 01:02:23,500
Scotty, you're not talkin'...

586
01:02:23,700 --> 01:02:25,200
about throwing people
off this bus?

587
01:02:25,300 --> 01:02:26,900
It's funny
you should say that, D...

588
01:02:27,100 --> 01:02:28,100
'cause the only other one...

589
01:02:28,300 --> 01:02:29,600
we know it picked out
for sure was you.

590
01:02:29,700 --> 01:02:31,100
Whoa! Hold on a second!

591
01:02:31,300 --> 01:02:33,100
We all saw the way
it sniffed you out back there.

592
01:02:33,300 --> 01:02:35,400
You were the only one
it gave tongue action, man...

593
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:37,600
-and we all saw it.
-Scotty!

594
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:40,500
I don't understand
what you're trying to do.

595
01:02:40,700 --> 01:02:41,900
I'm trying to stay alive.

596
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,300
You're trying to split us up!

597
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:48,900
We have just dropped a notch
on the fucking food chain, man.

598
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:57,800
This is about
living or dying now, OK?

599
01:02:59,300 --> 01:03:01,100
And if this bus
is the only thing...

600
01:03:01,300 --> 01:03:02,600
keeping that fucker
away for us...

601
01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:05,100
how safe are we, you guys...

602
01:03:05,300 --> 01:03:08,900
with everybody it's hungry for
sittin' inside it?

603
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:14,600
I want to see hands.

604
01:03:17,100 --> 01:03:19,600
I want to see hands...

605
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:22,400
'cause as shitty a deal
as it is...

606
01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:29,300
I gotta say I'd like you, Bucky,
and Jake off this bus, man.

607
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:34,700
You listen to me,
you piece of shit!

608
01:03:34,900 --> 01:03:39,200
He looked at you, too, bro.

609
01:03:39,500 --> 01:03:42,500
I saw him, and you did, too.

610
01:03:42,700 --> 01:03:46,900
He looked right at you
and smiled.

611
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:49,700
And when you made Jake
take the lights off it...

612
01:03:49,900 --> 01:03:52,500
he could've looked at you twice
and licked his fucking lips...

613
01:03:52,700 --> 01:03:54,800
but we don't know that.

614
01:03:55,100 --> 01:03:58,200
So you keep
your little blacklist.

615
01:03:58,500 --> 01:04:02,000
'Cause when he takes you out--
and I hope he does--

616
01:04:03,700 --> 01:04:05,900
I'm gonna be the one
gettin' as far away...

617
01:04:06,100 --> 01:04:08,600
from your sorry ass as I can.

618
01:04:13,900 --> 01:04:15,600
"Time to go" is right.

619
01:04:18,600 --> 01:04:20,900
-I'm gonna go find that farm.
-Then I'm going with you.

620
01:04:21,100 --> 01:04:22,600
You know I'm coming.

621
01:04:25,900 --> 01:04:28,300
You want to keep this bus?

622
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:30,200
Then you sit in it.

623
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:33,300
Right under that big hole.

624
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:35,400
See how long you last.

625
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:40,500
Look, I'm sorry, D.

626
01:04:40,700 --> 01:04:42,600
You are so right about that.

627
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:48,500
Come on, guys.

628
01:04:50,100 --> 01:04:51,400
Come on, help is on the way.

629
01:04:51,500 --> 01:04:53,100
Why are we splitting up?

630
01:04:53,300 --> 01:04:54,600
He said he was coming.

631
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:56,800
We're gonna leave,
and he's gonna pull up.

632
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:00,000
That bus is a deathtrap, Bucky.
Use your head.

633
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:01,900
You're really gonna
let them go alone?

634
01:05:02,100 --> 01:05:03,400
What, do you want
to go with them?

635
01:05:03,500 --> 01:05:04,900
We don't know who it picked out.

636
01:05:05,100 --> 01:05:07,100
Jesus Christ,
it looked at everyone.

637
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:12,400
Scotty, let go of me.

638
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:15,500
-Let go of you?
-Let go of me!

639
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:29,700
Fuck.

640
01:05:34,100 --> 01:05:36,000
Rho...

641
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:38,900
tell me you're really
walking away from me.

642
01:05:39,100 --> 01:05:40,900
You used me. You used all of us!

643
01:05:41,100 --> 01:05:42,900
All you care about is yourself.

644
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:44,000
Rho...

645
01:05:44,300 --> 01:05:47,400
You want to know, Scotty,
what I found out today?

646
01:05:47,600 --> 01:05:49,000
When people get really scared...

647
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:50,900
it's just like
when they get drunk.

648
01:05:51,100 --> 01:05:52,900
The real person
comes to the surface.

649
01:05:53,100 --> 01:05:55,400
We could've protected
D and Jake and all of us...

650
01:05:55,600 --> 01:05:56,800
if we'd stuck together!

651
01:05:56,900 --> 01:05:58,700
You know, like in a team.

652
01:05:58,900 --> 01:06:00,900
Hey. Hey!

653
01:06:10,100 --> 01:06:11,200
Jonny!

654
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:16,000
-Open the door!
-Open the door!

655
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:17,700
Open the door!

656
01:06:19,300 --> 01:06:21,200
You little cocksucker!
I will fucking fry you!

657
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:24,300
You open these goddamn doors!
You open them right now!

658
01:06:24,500 --> 01:06:27,800
Jonny, open the fucking doors,
man! Open the--

659
01:06:30,600 --> 01:06:33,300
Open the--
This is my bus, too, man!

660
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:40,700
Run!

661
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,800
Run! He's right behind you, D!

662
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
Run! Run!

663
01:07:26,100 --> 01:07:29,800
Get back! Get off! Break off!

664
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:44,600
Oh, God!

665
01:08:00,300 --> 01:08:03,100
-Shit!
-Hold on, hold on!

666
01:08:03,300 --> 01:08:05,100
Hold still!

667
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:08,100
Stop moving! Stop!

668
01:08:08,300 --> 01:08:10,500
Come on, Scotty!

669
01:08:10,700 --> 01:08:13,200
You're hurting him!
You're hurting him!

670
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:14,900
Get me--

671
01:08:15,100 --> 01:08:18,000
-Hold still! Pull it out!
-Hold on!

672
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:22,200
Stop it! Keep back! Stop moving!

673
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:24,600
It's in there like it's welded!

674
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:27,700
Pull that out!
You're hurting him!

675
01:08:27,900 --> 01:08:29,300
Stop it, Scotty!

676
01:08:29,500 --> 01:08:31,800
-Hold still!
-Stop it, Scotty!

677
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:33,400
Izzy, hold him! Hold him!

678
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:35,400
Scotty, hold still!

679
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:37,800
Scotty, hold still!

680
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:43,800
Get it!

681
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:45,600
Please fuckin' hurry!

682
01:08:46,900 --> 01:08:48,600
Oh, God!

683
01:08:50,800 --> 01:08:52,200
Oh, shit! Please hurry!

684
01:08:52,400 --> 01:08:53,600
Oh, God! Please hurry!

685
01:08:53,800 --> 01:08:56,100
Oh, D, I'm sorry, man!
I'm so sorry!

686
01:08:56,300 --> 01:08:58,000
Please fuckin' help!

687
01:09:07,100 --> 01:09:09,200
Scotty! Scotty!

688
01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:11,600
Scotty! Scotty!

689
01:09:11,800 --> 01:09:14,200
Scotty! Scotty!

690
01:09:14,500 --> 01:09:18,900
Damn it! Scotty! Scotty!

691
01:09:45,700 --> 01:09:47,600
What is it, boy? What is it?

692
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:58,200
Papa!

693
01:10:06,900 --> 01:10:08,800
Go. Go!

694
01:10:23,500 --> 01:10:25,200
Where did you come from?

695
01:10:27,500 --> 01:10:29,100
From that bus?

696
01:10:31,300 --> 01:10:33,600
How far up ahead?

697
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:34,900
Huh?

698
01:10:36,700 --> 01:10:38,000
Come on, answer me.

699
01:10:39,300 --> 01:10:40,900
It doesn't matter.

700
01:10:43,200 --> 01:10:46,300
There's no one on the bus,
and you can't kill it.

701
01:10:49,400 --> 01:10:53,200
Jacky, get the dog inside.

702
01:10:53,500 --> 01:10:54,900
Look, you can't stop it!

703
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,100
You get in the cabin
with Jack Jr.

704
01:10:57,300 --> 01:10:59,100
You stay down till this is over.

705
01:10:59,300 --> 01:11:01,100
This'll never be over!

706
01:11:02,700 --> 01:11:04,700
It doesn't matter what you do.

707
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:09,500
It'll be back...

708
01:11:09,700 --> 01:11:12,100
twenty-three years from now...

709
01:11:12,300 --> 01:11:14,700
and twenty-three years
from then.

710
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,200
Get us to that bus.

711
01:11:35,200 --> 01:11:36,600
Jonny?

712
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:40,100
Jonny?

713
01:11:49,900 --> 01:11:51,200
What was that?

714
01:11:56,400 --> 01:11:58,400
Jonny?

715
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:03,500
Bucky!

716
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:05,400
What are you doin' here?

717
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:07,500
What are you doin' here?

718
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:11,700
You let her in, huh, Jonny?

719
01:12:16,200 --> 01:12:18,800
Have you seen anybody else?

720
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
What are you doing?

721
01:12:21,200 --> 01:12:24,500
That thing is after you, Bucky.

722
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:26,900
Hey, there's no farm
out there, man.

723
01:12:27,100 --> 01:12:29,800
I must--I must've run ten miles
all over this fuckin' valley.

724
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:31,800
Bucky...

725
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:35,500
come on, just please go away.

726
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:38,500
Don't make me
go back out there again, man.

727
01:12:38,700 --> 01:12:40,700
It's fuckin' freaky
out there, man. Please.

728
01:15:09,100 --> 01:15:10,400
Get around the bus!

729
01:15:21,500 --> 01:15:23,000
Jacky!

730
01:15:23,100 --> 01:15:25,600
Get us around this bus now!

731
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:28,800
Now! Get around the bus!

732
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,200
Jacky, get out!
Get out of there now!

733
01:16:25,500 --> 01:16:27,500
Jacky!

734
01:16:29,700 --> 01:16:31,100
You all right?

735
01:16:33,100 --> 01:16:34,300
Jacky, answer me!

736
01:16:36,300 --> 01:16:38,700
Jacky, answer me!

737
01:16:38,900 --> 01:16:40,200
Are you OK?

738
01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:42,300
I think so.

739
01:16:56,500 --> 01:17:00,600
Jacky, get us away
from the bus!

740
01:17:00,900 --> 01:17:04,300
Come on, let's go!
Get us away from the bus!

741
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:09,300
Come on, Jacky, go on!
Get us away!

742
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:10,700
Move it!

743
01:17:19,700 --> 01:17:21,100
Dad?

744
01:17:22,900 --> 01:17:25,400
-Dad?
-Yeah!

745
01:17:35,300 --> 01:17:36,700
Dad!

746
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:53,700
All you kids, get down!

747
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:10,300
Jacky!

748
01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:12,000
Jacky!

749
01:19:12,200 --> 01:19:14,800
You gotta get us
away from the bus now!

750
01:19:20,600 --> 01:19:21,800
Come on!

751
01:19:40,900 --> 01:19:42,000
Dad!

752
01:19:46,300 --> 01:19:47,600
Dad, get out of there.

753
01:19:47,800 --> 01:19:50,200
The spool's jammed
in the cradle!

754
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:51,700
Dad, just get out!

755
01:19:51,800 --> 01:19:54,100
The cradle's welded
to the truck's frame.

756
01:19:54,300 --> 01:19:55,400
Get out, dad!

757
01:19:55,600 --> 01:19:57,900
He'll rip my gun
right out of the truck!

758
01:19:58,200 --> 01:19:59,700
Dad, just get the fuck
out of there!

759
01:20:29,300 --> 01:20:32,300
Dad, dad...

760
01:20:32,500 --> 01:20:34,600
are you OK?

761
01:20:36,700 --> 01:20:38,100
Dad!

762
01:20:43,400 --> 01:20:45,500
Dad?

763
01:20:46,900 --> 01:20:48,100
Dad!

764
01:21:02,700 --> 01:21:04,800
You're not going
to believe this...

765
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:06,500
but I think
I found a way out of here.

766
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:12,700
What?

767
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:14,600
Minxie said it doesn't matter.

768
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:16,500
It doesn't matter
what Minxie said.

769
01:21:18,700 --> 01:21:19,800
Right?

770
01:21:22,700 --> 01:21:25,000
The others might've gotten away.

771
01:21:25,200 --> 01:21:27,600
We don't know that.

772
01:21:27,900 --> 01:21:29,200
Kimball, too.

773
01:21:33,100 --> 01:21:36,100
Hey, nobody gets to decide
we die.

774
01:21:36,300 --> 01:21:38,900
No dream, nobody--
nobody gets to decide that!

775
01:21:39,200 --> 01:21:40,400
That is bullshit!

776
01:21:47,200 --> 01:21:48,500
I hope so.

777
01:21:51,100 --> 01:21:54,000
Come on, I want to go show you
a big ugly bug.

778
01:21:59,700 --> 01:22:01,200
That's the truck
that passed us this morning--

779
01:22:01,300 --> 01:22:02,800
you remember,
with the big bug on top of it?

780
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:04,200
You think we can just
drive away in it?

781
01:22:04,300 --> 01:22:06,100
No, but I think I know
how to hot-wire a truck.

782
01:22:06,300 --> 01:22:07,300
That's how I got
in my bar fight.

783
01:22:07,500 --> 01:22:09,000
I was trying to steal
somebody's truck.

784
01:22:09,100 --> 01:22:11,000
A gay bar?

785
01:22:11,200 --> 01:22:13,000
Jesus Christ.

786
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:21,000
Wherever he was going,
I don't think he made it.

787
01:22:26,300 --> 01:22:29,400
Oh, my God.
The keys are in it.

788
01:22:29,700 --> 01:22:31,600
Come on, man,
the keys are in it.

789
01:22:35,900 --> 01:22:37,500
It's not birds.

790
01:22:37,700 --> 01:22:40,300
-Come on.
-Fuck!

791
01:22:40,500 --> 01:22:41,600
Shit!

792
01:22:43,800 --> 01:22:44,800
D!

793
01:22:45,800 --> 01:22:47,300
Go! Go, go!

794
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:51,500
Go, go, go! Go, go!

795
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:52,900
Go, man, go!

796
01:23:03,400 --> 01:23:05,300
I'm a sitting duck
back here, lzzy! Step on it!

797
01:23:05,400 --> 01:23:07,100
I've got it floored!

798
01:23:07,300 --> 01:23:08,300
Go! Come on, go!

799
01:23:08,500 --> 01:23:10,700
-Go faster! Make it go faster!
-I can't!

800
01:23:14,200 --> 01:23:16,700
Go, go!

801
01:23:16,900 --> 01:23:18,100
Go, man! Go, go!

802
01:23:18,300 --> 01:23:20,400
Izzy, go!

803
01:23:20,600 --> 01:23:24,200
Go! Izzy!
Move this piece of shit!

804
01:23:24,400 --> 01:23:27,800
Come on! Come on! Move it!

805
01:23:28,100 --> 01:23:31,000
Izzy! Go, go!

806
01:23:41,400 --> 01:23:43,500
Izzy, do something!

807
01:23:47,400 --> 01:23:48,600
Izzy!

808
01:23:48,700 --> 01:23:50,100
Get down!

809
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:54,800
Izzy!

810
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,500
Come on! Come on!

811
01:23:57,700 --> 01:23:59,900
Izzy!

812
01:24:00,100 --> 01:24:02,500
Izzy, fucking do something!

813
01:24:04,300 --> 01:24:05,800
-Get out!
-What?

814
01:24:05,900 --> 01:24:08,900
Come on! Come on! Come on!

815
01:24:09,200 --> 01:24:11,800
-Get out!
-Are you fucking crazy?

816
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:14,800
Izzy! Izzy!

817
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,700
-Come on! Izzy!
-Stay down!

818
01:24:19,500 --> 01:24:21,100
Stay down!

819
01:32:33,400 --> 01:32:34,600
It isn't dead.

820
01:32:40,400 --> 01:32:42,500
Its time ran out.

821
01:33:00,400 --> 01:33:02,500
It looks dead to me.

822
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:28,900
You Taggart?

823
01:34:29,100 --> 01:34:30,100
That's right.

824
01:34:32,500 --> 01:34:33,700
Can we see it?

825
01:34:33,900 --> 01:34:35,300
Can you read?

826
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:42,700
This something real?

827
01:34:44,700 --> 01:34:47,800
Because I heard
it was a bunch of bullshit.

828
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:49,700
It's still five bucks.

829
01:34:52,900 --> 01:34:54,300
Where'd it come from?

830
01:34:56,700 --> 01:34:58,300
My dad killed it.

831
01:34:58,500 --> 01:35:00,200
Yeah, but where'd it come from?

832
01:35:02,200 --> 01:35:03,900
It's five bucks from you, too.

833
01:35:06,800 --> 01:35:07,900
How'd he kill it?

834
01:35:13,200 --> 01:35:14,500
Ask him.

835
01:35:50,200 --> 01:35:51,200
Come on, man.

836
01:35:51,300 --> 01:35:54,000
We ought to go get
our money back.

837
01:35:55,700 --> 01:35:57,900
What the hell is it?

838
01:35:58,100 --> 01:35:59,500
What do you think it is?

839
01:36:09,600 --> 01:36:12,200
We don't touch it.

840
01:36:22,700 --> 01:36:24,700
What's the story on this thing?

841
01:36:26,400 --> 01:36:28,900
Whatever you've heard, probably.

842
01:36:29,100 --> 01:36:32,300
You expect us to think
that that thing's real?

843
01:36:32,500 --> 01:36:33,900
Don't really care.

844
01:36:34,100 --> 01:36:35,900
How'd you kill it?

845
01:36:38,700 --> 01:36:42,800
Stabbed it
right through the heart...

846
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:46,300
with a big homemade harpoon.

847
01:36:54,600 --> 01:36:56,100
When?

848
01:36:57,300 --> 01:36:59,900
About twenty-three years ago.

849
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:05,300
You waiting for something?

850
01:37:09,100 --> 01:37:11,400
About three more days...

851
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:17,500
give or take a day or two.
