1
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:49,769
Okay, all right, hold up.

2
00:00:49,965 --> 00:00:53,404
Someone has to say something
nice about my friend Herb tonight,

3
00:00:53,635 --> 00:00:56,024
so I'm gonna give it a shot.

4
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:59,576
I have followed Herb Lee
my whole writing career.

5
00:00:59,807 --> 00:01:04,164
I followed him through three publishing
houses, and when he started his own.

6
00:01:04,435 --> 00:01:09,350
It's embarrassing to need your editor
so badly, so I'm gratified to announce

7
00:01:09,648 --> 00:01:13,402
that he has now followed me
to Central Connecticut. Thank you.

8
00:01:13,651 --> 00:01:16,006
I didn't follow you,
I had three heart attacks.

9
00:01:16,195 --> 00:01:18,834
This was a pre-emptive strike
against decrepitude.

10
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:21,590
Well, whatever brought you here

11
00:01:21,782 --> 00:01:24,421
to the beautiful
Marigold Retirement Community,

12
00:01:24,618 --> 00:01:28,247
I just want to say I'm glad you're here,
right down the road from my place,

13
00:01:28,496 --> 00:01:31,727
and as long as Pippa
keeps making that butterflied lamb,

14
00:01:31,957 --> 00:01:34,266
I'll do anything.
I'll even caddy for you.

15
00:01:34,459 --> 00:01:37,019
That's fine,
as long as I don't have to play golf.

16
00:01:37,211 --> 00:01:40,169
Wait, one more thing.
I just want to say something else.

17
00:01:40,381 --> 00:01:43,214
I have known Pippa Lee for 25 years...

18
00:01:44,467 --> 00:01:47,459
<i>...and I think
that I will never really know her.</i>

19
00:01:47,678 --> 00:01:50,954
She is a mystery. An enigma.

20
00:01:51,181 --> 00:01:56,539
Giving, caring, beautiful, intelligent,

21
00:01:56,852 --> 00:01:59,286
the very icon of an artist's wife.

22
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:02,357
- What are you talking about?
- No, you are.

23
00:02:02,565 --> 00:02:05,637
And who precisely is this artist
that Pippa is married to?

24
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:07,850
Exactly!

25
00:02:08,028 --> 00:02:10,667
Yes, that's my point!
That's what it's come down to.

26
00:02:10,863 --> 00:02:13,855
The one true artist's wife
left in the modern world,

27
00:02:14,074 --> 00:02:16,065
and she ended up with a publisher.

28
00:02:16,242 --> 00:02:19,552
To Herb and Pippa
and their weird new condo.

29
00:02:19,787 --> 00:02:23,143
Yeah, I just, er, got three new poems.

30
00:02:23,373 --> 00:02:27,571
Wonderful. If you'd ever like to show
them to somebody who's non-judgemental,

31
00:02:27,835 --> 00:02:30,144
- I'd be happy to take a look at them.
- Really?

32
00:02:30,337 --> 00:02:33,329
I would like that.
That would mean so much to me.

33
00:02:33,548 --> 00:02:36,540
I wish Sam wouldn't keep saying
Daddy moved to be near him.

34
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:40,547
He's a satirist. Anyway, nothing's
going to put a dent in Herb's ego.

35
00:02:40,804 --> 00:02:42,795
It's you I'm worried about.

36
00:02:44,598 --> 00:02:46,236
It's time for dessert.

37
00:02:46,391 --> 00:02:49,986
But, Herb, what is the real reason
you moved here?

38
00:02:50,228 --> 00:02:52,537
Scaling down, making life more simple.

39
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:55,722
I've liquidated everything
so that when I go,

40
00:02:55,941 --> 00:02:59,411
Pippa and the kids can get everything
and not give it to the government.

41
00:02:59,652 --> 00:03:01,961
I thought you loved paying taxes.

42
00:03:02,154 --> 00:03:05,305
I have to admit, I actually like
this house. It's so easy.

43
00:03:05,532 --> 00:03:07,807
I'm glad you feel that way, sweetie.

44
00:03:08,784 --> 00:03:11,981
Though I can't help wondering
how many people have died here.

45
00:03:12,204 --> 00:03:16,482
Your problem is you're too adaptable.
You're the adaptable enigma.

46
00:03:21,169 --> 00:03:25,321
<i>To be perfectly honest,
I've had enough of being an enigma.</i>

47
00:03:29,884 --> 00:03:31,875
<i>I wanna be known.</i>

48
00:03:38,057 --> 00:03:41,333
<i>Like many people,
I have lived more than one life,</i>

49
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,120
<i>so we're going to have to start
at the beginning.</i>

50
00:03:44,312 --> 00:03:46,985
Breathe. Breathe.
- Shut up!

51
00:03:48,357 --> 00:03:50,871
I see the head. Come on, one good push!

52
00:03:51,068 --> 00:03:53,423
Oh, fuck you!

53
00:03:53,612 --> 00:03:55,762
Good girl.

54
00:03:55,947 --> 00:03:59,178
<i>My birth was marked
by several unusual occurrences.</i>

55
00:03:59,408 --> 00:04:02,798
<i>First of all,
I was covered in fine blonde fur.</i>

56
00:04:05,204 --> 00:04:07,957
- Why is she furry?
- That's nothing to worry about.

57
00:04:08,165 --> 00:04:11,237
When a baby's this late,
it has time to grow vestigial hair,

58
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:13,290
from the time that we were monkeys.

59
00:04:14,211 --> 00:04:18,443
I had a monkey! I had a monkey!

60
00:04:18,715 --> 00:04:21,434
You can expect to have
a beautiful baby girl.

61
00:04:21,634 --> 00:04:24,592
The hair is just vestigial,
as I tried to tell your wife.

62
00:04:24,803 --> 00:04:28,955
I'm sorry if it offends you, Father, but
we believe that millions of years ago,

63
00:04:29,223 --> 00:04:31,691
- humans were covered with fur.
- I know that.

64
00:04:31,892 --> 00:04:34,122
So, is it a baby or a pet?

65
00:04:34,311 --> 00:04:38,020
<i>Suky knew my condition
had nothing to do with evolution.</i>

66
00:04:38,272 --> 00:04:42,424
<i>It was all her fault,
because my mother had a secret,</i>

67
00:04:42,692 --> 00:04:45,570
<i>her own little stash of sin.</i>

68
00:04:51,741 --> 00:04:54,699
- How's my pal?
- I'm OK.

69
00:04:56,662 --> 00:04:59,699
Are you having a hard time
living here in Wrinkleberry?

70
00:04:59,914 --> 00:05:04,704
It's strange having so much time on my
hands. This place is easy to maintain,

71
00:05:05,002 --> 00:05:07,641
but there's gonna be charity work
I can find.

72
00:05:07,837 --> 00:05:11,068
- You wanna move back to the city?
- We just sold our apartment.

73
00:05:11,298 --> 00:05:14,574
- Well, we can get another one.
- Are you serious?

74
00:05:14,801 --> 00:05:16,439
No.

75
00:05:17,637 --> 00:05:22,028
I'm just having a hard time
thinking of this as the end of the line.

76
00:05:25,351 --> 00:05:30,709
I think it's sort of romantic...
starting all over, just the two of us.

77
00:05:31,022 --> 00:05:32,614
So little stuff.

78
00:05:32,774 --> 00:05:35,766
Must you always look at the bright side?

79
00:05:39,154 --> 00:05:41,270
Can I get you anything?

80
00:05:41,447 --> 00:05:44,644
- Some carrot juice?
- No, I'm fine.

81
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:52,752
What was that cheese
we had for lunch yesterday?

82
00:05:52,956 --> 00:05:57,154
It was vacherin. I was so excited
to find that at the market.

83
00:05:57,418 --> 00:05:59,409
I love that cheese.

84
00:06:11,596 --> 00:06:14,429
<i>Once I lost my furry coat,
my mother was so relieved</i>

85
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,837
<i>that she became sort of obsessed
with my appearance.</i>

86
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:20,574
<i>She even took a drawing course
at the town hall,</i>

87
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:23,603
<i>the sole purpose of which
was making pictures of me.</i>

88
00:06:23,814 --> 00:06:27,204
Sweetheart,
you have the most beautiful eyes.

89
00:06:27,442 --> 00:06:31,196
I think God took all of our best
features and put them on your face.

90
00:06:31,445 --> 00:06:34,198
Don't you move. Almost done.

91
00:06:40,077 --> 00:06:44,036
Why, you little...
Turkey, turkey, turkey, turkey.

92
00:06:44,289 --> 00:06:45,802
Ouch!

93
00:06:48,501 --> 00:06:52,255
<i>She dressed me up as angels,
cowgirls, movie stars.</i>

94
00:06:53,963 --> 00:06:56,033
<i>I was her prize possession.</i>

95
00:06:56,215 --> 00:06:58,683
<i># You're real, real cool</i>

96
00:06:58,884 --> 00:07:00,442
<i># For you I'm a fool</i>

97
00:07:01,511 --> 00:07:03,979
<i>- # Teen baby, be mine
- # Honey, I will</i>

98
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:07,809
<i>- # Teen baby, be mine
- # Honey, you know I will</i>

99
00:07:08,058 --> 00:07:09,889
<i># Baby, be mine</i>

100
00:07:10,685 --> 00:07:12,596
<i># All of the time</i>

101
00:07:13,354 --> 00:07:15,072
<i># Oh, don't you know</i>

102
00:07:16,023 --> 00:07:17,615
<i># I love you so</i>

103
00:07:18,608 --> 00:07:20,997
<i>- # Glad you're my date
- # Do-do, do-do-do</i>

104
00:07:21,193 --> 00:07:23,661
<i># With me, you're great
Teen baby, be mine</i>

105
00:07:50,216 --> 00:07:54,368
Who else has a key?
- The cleaning lady.

106
00:07:57,389 --> 00:08:00,665
But I can't see Miss Fanning
breaking in with a few friends

107
00:08:00,892 --> 00:08:03,725
to have chocolate cake
in the middle of the night.

108
00:08:03,936 --> 00:08:06,734
- And the maintenance people?
- You think it was me?

109
00:08:06,938 --> 00:08:11,409
- You think I'm losing my marbles?
- I wasn't saying that. I wasn't...

110
00:08:11,692 --> 00:08:13,683
- Hey.
- There she is.

111
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,930
Hi, Daddy.

112
00:08:16,112 --> 00:08:18,307
- You look great.
- Oh, thanks.

113
00:08:18,489 --> 00:08:20,798
- Hey, Mom.
- Hi.

114
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:24,142
- I'm starving. Can I get lamb chops?
- Anything you want.

115
00:08:24,369 --> 00:08:27,247
- Do you want a drink first?
- Yeah.

116
00:08:27,454 --> 00:08:30,605
Oh, Ben says, er,
he can't make it until later,

117
00:08:30,832 --> 00:08:33,221
- so we should just order without him.
- OK.

118
00:08:33,417 --> 00:08:36,807
OK, these are just work prints, but...

119
00:08:37,045 --> 00:08:39,434
- Oh, my God.
- You get the idea.

120
00:08:41,132 --> 00:08:44,886
That's incredible. It's amazing, even.

121
00:08:45,135 --> 00:08:47,968
Were you in a doorway? Where were you
when you took this?

122
00:08:48,179 --> 00:08:51,330
Yeah, I just waited there.
I knew they were coming back.

123
00:08:51,557 --> 00:08:54,754
That's incredibly powerful.
Look at this.

124
00:08:56,811 --> 00:08:59,245
Oh!

125
00:08:59,438 --> 00:09:02,828
- These are so... powerful.
- These are wonderful.

126
00:09:03,066 --> 00:09:07,139
Grace, this... Hmm.

127
00:09:07,403 --> 00:09:11,112
- Were you alone when you took these?
- No, we had a guide.

128
00:09:11,364 --> 00:09:12,399
You had a guide?

129
00:09:12,532 --> 00:09:15,569
And I hitched a ride with,
erm, Giles Oppenheim.

130
00:09:15,785 --> 00:09:17,457
- With Giles Oppenheim?
- Hm-hmm.

131
00:09:17,619 --> 00:09:20,770
- How did you manage that?
- He kind of adopted me.

132
00:09:20,997 --> 00:09:24,467
Did you hear about that photographer
that got shot in Baghdad last week?

133
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:26,141
Uh-huh.

134
00:09:26,293 --> 00:09:30,764
You heard about the bomb?

135
00:09:31,047 --> 00:09:33,322
- Ben, shut up.
- What bomb?

136
00:09:33,507 --> 00:09:35,498
- She was with Oppenheim.
- Ben!

137
00:09:35,675 --> 00:09:38,951
<i>And they heard the whistle.</i>

138
00:09:39,178 --> 00:09:42,568
And he wanted to go left,
but she saw an alley towards the right,

139
00:09:42,806 --> 00:09:46,116
and she pulled him towards it,
and that's when the bomb hit.

140
00:09:46,351 --> 00:09:48,501
They turn around,
and if they'd gone left,

141
00:09:48,686 --> 00:09:51,075
they would have been
smashed to smithereens.

142
00:09:51,271 --> 00:09:54,581
- She thinks she's immortal now.
- That's a complete distortion.

143
00:09:54,816 --> 00:09:57,967
- Why can't you ever not say something?
- I do not know.

144
00:09:58,193 --> 00:10:01,868
Sweetheart, everybody knows you're
a killer but you gotta be careful.

145
00:10:02,113 --> 00:10:05,389
- You have to use your common sense.
- I do. Dad, look...

146
00:10:05,616 --> 00:10:07,846
There's no way
that I'm not gonna go back.

147
00:10:08,034 --> 00:10:10,867
If you had seen what I saw,
you would feel the same.

148
00:10:11,079 --> 00:10:13,991
You would want to give these people
some dignity.

149
00:10:14,206 --> 00:10:17,596
- Just be careful.
- Anyway, I'm going to Baghdad Saturday.

150
00:10:17,834 --> 00:10:23,670
- What's new with you?
- Oh, I found a book. A real cash cow.

151
00:10:24,005 --> 00:10:27,918
Since when do you say "cash cow"?

152
00:10:28,175 --> 00:10:30,928
I never said it
because I never found one before.

153
00:10:31,136 --> 00:10:36,005
- What's it about?
- Oh, it's about war and romance,

154
00:10:36,307 --> 00:10:38,867
- and, er, bad weather.
- Is it good?

155
00:10:39,059 --> 00:10:44,133
A certain kind of good. Highbrow
for lowbrows or lowbrow for highbrows.

156
00:10:44,438 --> 00:10:47,828
Summer reading for people
with multimillion-dollar beach homes.

157
00:10:48,066 --> 00:10:51,376
- Used to be us.
- We still wouldn't have read this book.

158
00:10:51,611 --> 00:10:54,887
So, how are you, Ben?
How is your paper coming?

159
00:10:55,114 --> 00:10:57,184
- Fine.
- What's it about?

160
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:59,959
- The right to die.
- The right to die?

161
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:04,311
Or the right to kill.

162
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:17,913
<i># A sweet little kiss with a wee embrace
A pretty little smile</i>

163
00:11:18,174 --> 00:11:22,452
<i> Suky's energy was unflagging,
day and night.</i>

164
00:11:25,763 --> 00:11:29,039
<i>In spite of
an apparently weak thyroid,</i>

165
00:11:29,266 --> 00:11:32,258
<i>for which she took pills
at seven each morning,</i>

166
00:11:32,477 --> 00:11:37,835
<i>12 noon, and four each afternoon,
I was the only one who knew</i>

167
00:11:38,148 --> 00:11:42,107
<i>that she was secretly pretending
to be in a commercial half the time,</i>

168
00:11:42,359 --> 00:11:44,748
<i>or a movie, and she was the star.</i>

169
00:11:46,071 --> 00:11:52,146
<i>- I thought she was absolutely perfect.
- Mom, can I have some more milk? Mom?</i>

170
00:11:52,493 --> 00:11:56,452
<i>Then there were days when Suky
shorted out,</i>

171
00:11:56,704 --> 00:11:59,776
<i>- like a run-down robot.
- Eat up, kids.</i>

172
00:11:59,999 --> 00:12:03,548
<i>I always felt my real mother
had disappeared in those moments.</i>

173
00:12:03,793 --> 00:12:07,149
<i>It scared me and made me angry.</i>

174
00:12:11,424 --> 00:12:13,892
<i>I thought it must be my fault
that she was sad,</i>

175
00:12:14,093 --> 00:12:16,653
<i>and it was up to me
to make her happy again.</i>

176
00:12:26,686 --> 00:12:30,395
<i>I thought maybe
you forgot to say goodnight. </i>

177
00:12:37,278 --> 00:12:39,394
<i>Her moods ruled my life.</i>

178
00:12:46,119 --> 00:12:48,952
<i>My baby.</i>

179
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:56,472
Oh, hello, Dot.

180
00:12:56,669 --> 00:13:00,662
- Would you like some coffee?
- Oh, no, I-I've already had some.

181
00:13:00,922 --> 00:13:03,994
- This is my son, Ben.
- Oh, the lawyer?

182
00:13:04,216 --> 00:13:06,935
Not yet. Nice to meet you.

183
00:13:07,135 --> 00:13:10,127
- And Herb. You met Herb.
- Oh, hi, Herb.

184
00:13:10,346 --> 00:13:12,655
Oh, my Lord.

185
00:13:12,848 --> 00:13:18,081
That's Mr Swaggart.
He needed to go.

186
00:13:18,394 --> 00:13:20,544
Erm, h-have a seat.

187
00:13:20,729 --> 00:13:23,687
You know, there are
other young wives here.

188
00:13:23,899 --> 00:13:27,130
You see them jogging around.

189
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,751
- Is everything OK?
- Well, yes, we're... We're fine.

190
00:13:33,073 --> 00:13:36,349
But my son, erm, Chris...

191
00:13:37,868 --> 00:13:40,302
- In Utah?
- Yes.

192
00:13:40,495 --> 00:13:43,328
He might be coming... east.

193
00:13:43,539 --> 00:13:46,451
Oh, that should be nice,
if they would move near you.

194
00:13:46,667 --> 00:13:51,661
The thing is, he's had some kind
of crisis with his wife, and...

195
00:13:51,963 --> 00:13:54,761
He's left her, and he's...

196
00:13:54,965 --> 00:13:59,880
He's living in his car.
I just don't know what to do.

197
00:14:00,177 --> 00:14:06,650
He was always sort of half baked.
You know what I mean?

198
00:14:10,686 --> 00:14:13,678
You know, it's painful, I know...

199
00:14:15,648 --> 00:14:20,164
<i>...but sometimes you just have to maybe
accept they are who they are.</i>

200
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:24,762
I mean, I-I feel that with my daughter.

201
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:26,980
You're right.

202
00:14:27,157 --> 00:14:32,595
I knew that I should come to you.
You... I just had a feeling.

203
00:14:34,288 --> 00:14:37,837
-  He's living in his car?
- Yes, she said he was half baked.

204
00:14:39,042 --> 00:14:42,114
- I wonder what that means.
- It's code. It means halfwit.

205
00:14:42,336 --> 00:14:44,770
Hello?

206
00:14:46,131 --> 00:14:48,361
Hello, Marianne.

207
00:14:48,549 --> 00:14:52,337
What? What?

208
00:14:52,594 --> 00:14:56,109
No, tell him 45
is the absolute top offer.

209
00:14:57,556 --> 00:15:00,070
If he goes somewhere else,
he goes somewhere else.

210
00:15:00,267 --> 00:15:03,816
Stop worrying. Everything's fine.
You're doing a fantastic job.

211
00:15:04,062 --> 00:15:08,260
Have a nice morning, Marianne.
God, that woman's gonna drive me crazy.

212
00:15:08,524 --> 00:15:12,073
Your blood pressure went
from 120 over 90 to 148 over 100.

213
00:15:12,318 --> 00:15:14,752
Since when did you become a nurse?

214
00:15:14,945 --> 00:15:16,378
A little appreciation...

215
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:19,488
Would you like to go to the doctor's
every 15 minutes?

216
00:15:19,699 --> 00:15:21,212
We gotta change our number.

217
00:15:21,367 --> 00:15:24,439
- I need an office.
- What is the point of having an office?

218
00:15:24,661 --> 00:15:27,459
The point is I spent 40 years
building up this company

219
00:15:27,664 --> 00:15:30,940
and they're crapping it up.
They're children there. Babies.

220
00:15:31,167 --> 00:15:33,761
If I had an office,
I can be there from ten to one,

221
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:38,636
talk to Marianne, read my manuscripts,
and when I come home, boom, I'm retired.

222
00:15:38,923 --> 00:15:41,118
Then we can be really together.

223
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:44,690
You had three heart attacks.
Is that not enough for you?

224
00:15:44,927 --> 00:15:47,600
Yeah.

225
00:15:47,805 --> 00:15:50,035
- I gotta go.
- Bye, sweetheart.

226
00:15:53,101 --> 00:15:55,092
- Love you.
- See you.

227
00:15:56,854 --> 00:16:01,166
- Back home.
- OK, sweetheart.

228
00:16:16,619 --> 00:16:18,610
What's happening here?

229
00:16:21,582 --> 00:16:27,259
OK. If I'm losing my marbles,
so be it, but I need proof.

230
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:47,422
<i> How long
before he loses his mind completely?</i>

231
00:16:56,318 --> 00:17:00,914
- The half-baked son is moving in!
- Wonderful.

232
00:17:04,491 --> 00:17:08,370
<i># After the ball is over</i>

233
00:17:08,619 --> 00:17:12,771
<i># After the break of morn</i>

234
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:17,317
<i>- # After the dancers' leaving
- Pippa!</i>

235
00:17:17,585 --> 00:17:21,658
Glad you could come by.
A little eye candy.

236
00:17:21,921 --> 00:17:24,799
Thank you for having me.
That's for you and Dot.

237
00:17:25,007 --> 00:17:27,885
I... wish you would keep an eye on Dot.

238
00:17:28,093 --> 00:17:32,211
She's having a hard time.
I know she talks to you.

239
00:17:32,471 --> 00:17:36,783
- Well, sure. Erm, where is she?
- He won't come out!

240
00:17:37,058 --> 00:17:40,971
Can you believe it?
A 35-year-old man hiding in his room

241
00:17:41,228 --> 00:17:43,742
when his parents
are throwing a party for him?

242
00:17:43,939 --> 00:17:47,295
I told her this was a bad idea.
He's right down the hall.

243
00:17:47,525 --> 00:17:49,914
- OK.
- Spare bedroom.

244
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:52,499
Get her to drink a Pepsi Cola
or something.

245
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:54,971
- OK.
-  I'm not going out there!

246
00:17:55,156 --> 00:17:58,990
You can go out there for five minutes.
You've got to eat something.

247
00:17:59,243 --> 00:18:02,155
Why are you crying? Stop crying.

248
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:07,728
- Yeah? Who is it?
- It's Pippa Lee. I'm looking for Dot.

249
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:10,032
Oh, dear.

250
00:18:12,628 --> 00:18:15,984
Erm, hi, Dot.
Johnny asked me to find you.

251
00:18:16,215 --> 00:18:18,570
Well, look at me.

252
00:18:18,758 --> 00:18:21,477
I can't go out there.

253
00:18:22,428 --> 00:18:24,419
I'm Pippa Lee.

254
00:18:25,597 --> 00:18:27,588
Chris.

255
00:18:30,976 --> 00:18:33,695
Oh, why are you putting that on? I...

256
00:18:33,895 --> 00:18:36,489
I ironed you that shirt I got you.

257
00:18:36,689 --> 00:18:39,681
Excuse me,
but there's something I need to do.

258
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,891
Where are you going?

259
00:18:46,822 --> 00:18:48,858
Where are you?

260
00:18:49,032 --> 00:18:54,152
He was the sweetest little boy.
I mean, you just can't imagine.

261
00:18:54,453 --> 00:18:57,650
When you adopt, you just
don't know what you're gonna get.

262
00:19:01,042 --> 00:19:05,433
<i> Look out!
Thank God she didn't fall in.</i>

263
00:19:05,712 --> 00:19:07,782
<i> Amazingly, it took me 16 years</i>

264
00:19:07,964 --> 00:19:10,603
<i>to figure out what was
behind Suky's personality.</i>

265
00:19:12,301 --> 00:19:15,418
- She's taking Dexedrine.
- Who is?

266
00:19:15,637 --> 00:19:17,628
Mom.

267
00:19:19,015 --> 00:19:21,893
- What's Dexedrine?
- Speed.

268
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:24,739
It's why she never sleeps,
why she acts so weird.

269
00:19:24,936 --> 00:19:26,927
Mom doesn't act weird.

270
00:19:36,654 --> 00:19:39,009
- Mom, why do you take this stuff?
- Hmm?

271
00:19:39,197 --> 00:19:42,667
- These pills. What do you take 'em for?
- It's my medicine.

272
00:19:42,909 --> 00:19:44,945
Can you put it back, please?

273
00:19:48,121 --> 00:19:50,112
Chester told me it was speed.

274
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:52,519
Chester doesn't know
what he's talking about.

275
00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:58,385
- What happens if you don't take them?
- I'd get fat, like Grandma Sally.

276
00:19:58,713 --> 00:20:03,787
Is that what you want? You all want me
to walk around like some sick walrus?

277
00:20:04,092 --> 00:20:07,129
- No.
- Why don't you just let me do my work?

278
00:20:07,345 --> 00:20:09,381
Better yet, why don't you help me?

279
00:20:09,555 --> 00:20:12,308
Why doesn't anybody around here
help me?

280
00:20:12,515 --> 00:20:15,632
The cross is made of
a vertical and a horizontal beam.

281
00:20:15,851 --> 00:20:19,127
The vertical beam
points to the sky, to the spirit.

282
00:20:19,354 --> 00:20:23,063
The horizontal beam is the line
of the earth, of life on earth.

283
00:20:23,316 --> 00:20:26,592
That's what's neat about Jesus.
He wasn't just the son of God.

284
00:20:26,818 --> 00:20:28,968
I'd like to know
what you're really like.

285
00:20:30,363 --> 00:20:33,435
- What do you mean?
- Without that stuff.

286
00:20:33,657 --> 00:20:38,651
Stop being so overdramatic.
You're blowing this out of proportion.

287
00:20:38,953 --> 00:20:42,992
So stop. I don't care if you get fat.

288
00:20:44,374 --> 00:20:46,365
It's my medicine.

289
00:20:52,797 --> 00:20:57,552
OK, fine.
Let's just hope I don't blow up.

290
00:20:58,677 --> 00:21:00,907
Father, thank you for this food,

291
00:21:01,096 --> 00:21:03,371
for the gift of being together
as a family.

292
00:21:03,556 --> 00:21:05,751
For these beautiful children around me.

293
00:21:05,933 --> 00:21:09,482
<i> Suky's cold turkey
lasted exactly one week.</i>

294
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:17,780
Who is the President?

295
00:21:17,984 --> 00:21:20,134
Does anyone know
who the President is?

296
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:22,389
Boys, it's lawn-mowing day tomorrow.

297
00:21:22,571 --> 00:21:26,689
<i> Imagine a dinner like this
that went on for an entire year.</i>

298
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:31,387
I know you want to get out
in the woods, but we won't do that...

299
00:21:31,662 --> 00:21:34,495
<i>She was taking
more and more of the stuff.</i>

300
00:21:37,583 --> 00:21:41,337
<i>I never knew who she was gonna be
from one minute to the next.</i>

301
00:21:41,586 --> 00:21:46,057
And I also would like someone
to take care of the gutters.

302
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:51,701
<i># Can't you hear me calling, calling?</i>

303
00:21:51,928 --> 00:21:53,839
<i># Calling for your love?</i>

304
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:56,705
Excuse me. Pippa!

305
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:33,548
What's going on here, miss?

306
00:22:33,753 --> 00:22:37,029
Come dance with me, Mom.
Mommy, dance with me, OK?

307
00:22:37,256 --> 00:22:40,407
- Put your feet on, OK?
- What is going on?

308
00:22:40,633 --> 00:22:43,989
Put your feet on. Come on, remember?

309
00:22:45,762 --> 00:22:48,071
Mommy, I got a little secret now, OK?

310
00:22:48,264 --> 00:22:52,303
<i>I totally did it.</i>

311
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:55,027
What? What are you talking about?

312
00:22:55,228 --> 00:22:59,141
- Huh?
- I'm high, too.

313
00:22:59,398 --> 00:23:02,595
Now we can both be high together, OK?
You and me, Mom.

314
00:23:02,818 --> 00:23:05,491
Oh, you took my medicine.
How much did you take?

315
00:23:05,695 --> 00:23:10,769
I don't know. It's OK, though, Mommy.
I love you. I love you.

316
00:23:11,074 --> 00:23:13,952
<i>Mom, I love you so much.</i>

317
00:23:17,246 --> 00:23:20,238
We just can't tell your dad about this,
OK?

318
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:26,209
- You're OK with this?
- Yeah.

319
00:23:35,385 --> 00:23:37,376
Yeah.

320
00:23:38,596 --> 00:23:42,271
- I am so... sick of you!
- You!

321
00:23:42,516 --> 00:23:45,394
I knew you were bad
from the day you were born!

322
00:23:45,602 --> 00:23:47,638
- You!
- No!

323
00:23:57,778 --> 00:24:00,087
<i>She was never going to back down.</i>

324
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:04,478
<i>She was never going to change, even if
it meant dragging me down with her.</i>

325
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:43,312
<i>Oh, Herb. </i>

326
00:25:25,056 --> 00:25:27,172
Herb. Herb. Herb!

327
00:25:28,392 --> 00:25:31,031
- Herb, wake up! It's me.
- What?

328
00:25:31,227 --> 00:25:33,343
- It's me on the video.
- Hold on, kid.

329
00:25:33,521 --> 00:25:36,877
- What are we talking about?
- The chocolate cake and the yogurt.

330
00:25:37,107 --> 00:25:39,223
I just saw it on the video.
It's horrible.

331
00:25:39,401 --> 00:25:41,119
It was you?

332
00:25:41,277 --> 00:25:45,793
<i>I was sitting on the floor,
eating like an animal. </i>

333
00:25:46,072 --> 00:25:49,951
Herb... I think I'm going insane.

334
00:25:50,201 --> 00:25:53,671
- Maybe I'm going insane.
- Come here.

335
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:58,298
Take it easy.

336
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:07,128
Look at it this way.
Your being a sleepwalker

337
00:26:07,339 --> 00:26:11,378
is a hell of a lot better
than me being senile, isn't it?

338
00:26:11,634 --> 00:26:14,865
- Hmm?
- Of course it is.

339
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:20,731
Sleepwalkers are a dime a dozen. You'll
never get off a murder rap that way.

340
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:34,676
Oh, my God.

341
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:09,689
Pippa Lee, right?

342
00:27:09,889 --> 00:27:12,244
Oh, hello.

343
00:27:12,433 --> 00:27:16,472
- You got a job already.
- I'm working my way to the top.

344
00:27:18,563 --> 00:27:22,681
- It's a beautiful day.
- Trying not to notice.

345
00:27:24,568 --> 00:27:27,321
Oh, and a pack of Marlboro Lights.

346
00:27:29,029 --> 00:27:31,259
- Costly habit.
- I don't really...

347
00:27:31,448 --> 00:27:33,439
I don't smoke, I just, erm...

348
00:27:35,118 --> 00:27:38,508
- You don't work here at night, do you?
- I haven't yet.

349
00:27:39,371 --> 00:27:41,168
Why do you ask?

350
00:27:41,331 --> 00:27:45,404
Oh, I just always thought,
what a horrible job it would be

351
00:27:45,668 --> 00:27:49,343
just waiting for someone
to buy his cigarettes or something.

352
00:27:50,964 --> 00:27:54,434
- Matches?
- Please.

353
00:27:58,344 --> 00:28:03,213
I'm sorry about ducking out on you.
I'm not a big party person.

354
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:06,109
Oh, no, no, no,
I shouldn't have interrupted.

355
00:28:08,894 --> 00:28:11,692
Erm, actually, I don't need a bag.
That's OK.

356
00:28:11,897 --> 00:28:14,616
And give your mother my best.

357
00:28:19,194 --> 00:28:21,913
These strawberries are so sweet.

358
00:28:22,113 --> 00:28:26,504
- These strawberries. So sweet.
- Mm. Maple Bank Farm.

359
00:28:26,784 --> 00:28:31,062
- How's the book coming?
- I'm 100 pages in. Who knows?

360
00:28:31,329 --> 00:28:35,686
- You know.
- How do you know I know?

361
00:28:35,958 --> 00:28:39,837
Cos you always do that. You pretend
it's not gonna work when you know it is.

362
00:28:40,086 --> 00:28:44,762
I have an idea. Why don't you
finish all my conversations for me,

363
00:28:45,048 --> 00:28:48,597
since you know what I'm thinking?
It'll save us all a lot of time.

364
00:28:48,843 --> 00:28:50,959
Well, there's a good idea.

365
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:57,389
Do bats really get in your hair?

366
00:28:57,642 --> 00:29:01,351
Can you please
just come up with one thing

367
00:29:01,603 --> 00:29:04,163
that isn't a weird little cliché?

368
00:29:04,355 --> 00:29:08,030
I think I left the lights on in the car.

369
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:38,440
<i> Aunt Trish was
the kindest person I have ever known.</i>

370
00:29:40,551 --> 00:29:42,667
We can talk about it later.

371
00:29:46,847 --> 00:29:49,122
Go get some rest.

372
00:29:59,566 --> 00:30:01,045
Who are you?

373
00:30:05,988 --> 00:30:09,867
I'm Kat. This is my room.

374
00:30:10,116 --> 00:30:11,913
I'm sorry.

375
00:30:12,076 --> 00:30:13,509
No problemo.

376
00:30:25,587 --> 00:30:28,863
Hey. Did you sleep OK?

377
00:30:31,466 --> 00:30:34,617
- Who's Kat?
- Er, she's my roommate.

378
00:30:34,844 --> 00:30:38,359
Listen, your parents
are gonna be here in a few hours.

379
00:30:38,597 --> 00:30:39,586
What?

380
00:30:39,723 --> 00:30:42,112
You have to deal with them
sooner or later.

381
00:30:42,308 --> 00:30:44,663
As far as I'm concerned,
you can stay with me,

382
00:30:44,852 --> 00:30:47,810
so long as you end up
with a high school diploma.

383
00:30:48,021 --> 00:30:50,216
I know there's a problem at your house.

384
00:30:50,398 --> 00:30:53,037
- You do?
- Hm-hmm.

385
00:30:53,234 --> 00:30:57,944
No one else is gonna say it, so I will.
You did good getting away.

386
00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:04,129
Hmm?

387
00:31:04,326 --> 00:31:07,796
- Ta-dah.
- OK, bye.

388
00:31:08,037 --> 00:31:10,505
Bye. Bye.

389
00:31:15,168 --> 00:31:18,285
- See you tonight, Pippa.
- Bye.

390
00:31:19,546 --> 00:31:22,219
Wow, Aunt Trish.

391
00:31:23,466 --> 00:31:25,616
We're a couple of black sheep,
you and me.

392
00:31:31,764 --> 00:31:34,437
I'm not running away.

393
00:31:34,642 --> 00:31:37,076
I'm just done, that's all.

394
00:31:37,269 --> 00:31:39,988
But what does that mean, you're done?

395
00:31:42,022 --> 00:31:45,173
It means I don't wanna live with you.

396
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:48,278
Oh, so this is all my fault.

397
00:31:48,486 --> 00:31:51,683
- What's all your fault?
- What you did to me!

398
00:31:53,156 --> 00:31:56,034
I didn't do anything to you.

399
00:31:57,785 --> 00:32:00,094
I'm done. Don't you get it?

400
00:32:00,287 --> 00:32:03,199
You're not even gonna come home
for Christmas any more?

401
00:32:03,414 --> 00:32:07,965
<i>No, I didn't say that. I... 
Of course I will, Mom.</i>

402
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,911
I just...

403
00:32:12,088 --> 00:32:14,966
I think it's better
if I don't live there any more.

404
00:32:15,174 --> 00:32:18,962
What... What did I do to you?

405
00:32:20,845 --> 00:32:24,884
What did I do to you to make you
so secretive and unhappy?

406
00:32:26,391 --> 00:32:28,382
Nothing.

407
00:32:30,227 --> 00:32:34,220
- What did I do to you?
- Please, Mom.

408
00:32:34,481 --> 00:32:35,880
Please.

409
00:32:40,027 --> 00:32:42,143
Don't be sad.

410
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:45,232
No, no, you don't be sad, honey, honey.

411
00:32:45,448 --> 00:32:49,566
My baby. It's OK. I love you so much.

412
00:32:49,826 --> 00:32:54,263
It's OK. It'll be OK, OK?

413
00:32:56,081 --> 00:32:58,037
I can't.

414
00:32:58,208 --> 00:33:00,199
- I can't.
- Pippa?

415
00:33:01,335 --> 00:33:03,371
- I'm done.
- Pippa!

416
00:33:04,421 --> 00:33:08,209
I promise. I promise!

417
00:33:21,935 --> 00:33:25,371
<i> I would never go home
for Christmas or anything else.</i>

418
00:33:37,531 --> 00:33:39,522
<i>I was free.</i>

419
00:33:52,835 --> 00:33:54,348
- Thank God.
- Chocolate?

420
00:33:54,503 --> 00:33:56,334
I thought you'd left me.

421
00:33:58,631 --> 00:34:01,589
I can't take it any more.
He's such a prick.

422
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:04,997
Aw.
Sam can have a mean sense of humour.

423
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:08,417
Look, maybe if you laughed along?

424
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:12,029
I have been laughing for four years
and now I'm crying.

425
00:34:12,267 --> 00:34:16,818
- I think Sandra's having an affair.
- What makes you think so?

426
00:34:18,564 --> 00:34:22,523
Well, she's talking about splitting
with Sam, and...

427
00:34:22,775 --> 00:34:26,370
She's terrified of being on her own,
and it just adds up.

428
00:34:26,612 --> 00:34:29,365
Maybe she wants you
to think she's having an affair,

429
00:34:29,572 --> 00:34:33,645
so you'll tell me, and I'll tell Sam,
and he starts treating her better.

430
00:34:33,909 --> 00:34:36,548
You really think
Sandra's that conniving?

431
00:34:38,246 --> 00:34:40,362
It's what women are like,
a lot of them.

432
00:34:40,539 --> 00:34:43,531
- Conniving?
- It's not conniving, it's human nature.

433
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:47,663
It's survival of the fittest.
Need I refresh your memory?

434
00:34:49,296 --> 00:34:54,370
- Never mind.
- I don't like this book.

435
00:34:54,676 --> 00:34:57,395
I'm going to sleep.

436
00:35:03,099 --> 00:35:05,738
I still think she's having an affair.

437
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:11,818
Oh, by the way,
I think I found you an office.

438
00:35:15,192 --> 00:35:18,104
- This is perfect.
- Oh, I'm so happy.

439
00:35:18,319 --> 00:35:21,550
It only took two days
to get the furniture.

440
00:35:21,781 --> 00:35:25,933
I just thought it would be great to
have a place away from Marigold Village.

441
00:35:27,410 --> 00:35:30,402
What's this for?
In case I get paper cuts?

442
00:35:30,621 --> 00:35:33,977
- Drop a phone on my foot?
- Old people bleed just like young ones.

443
00:35:34,207 --> 00:35:38,519
Well, why don't we get an EKG for
the corner, an oxygen tent over there?

444
00:35:38,794 --> 00:35:43,345
- OK, I'll leave you to it.
- Thank you for this.

445
00:35:43,631 --> 00:35:46,020
What a sweet woman you are.

446
00:35:57,684 --> 00:36:00,881
- He jumped right out at me.
- I'm sorry.

447
00:36:05,399 --> 00:36:07,833
I don't know what he was thinking.

448
00:36:14,781 --> 00:36:17,249
- Is he yours?
- No, no.

449
00:36:25,123 --> 00:36:26,602
Shit!

450
00:36:42,637 --> 00:36:45,754
- Hi. I'm so sorry I'm late.
- Oh, hi!

451
00:36:45,973 --> 00:36:48,441
- That's a beautiful purse.
- Oh, thank you.

452
00:36:48,641 --> 00:36:52,316
Oh, God. You look so beautiful.

453
00:36:52,561 --> 00:36:56,474
<i>- What are you doing different?
- It's the indolence. </i>

454
00:36:56,731 --> 00:36:59,723
I wish I could be peaceful and good
like you.

455
00:36:59,942 --> 00:37:01,853
Good?

456
00:37:04,779 --> 00:37:07,168
- What is it?
- I just...

457
00:37:07,365 --> 00:37:10,402
It's over between Sam and me.

458
00:37:10,617 --> 00:37:16,772
And it's just all so
completely, completely messed up,

459
00:37:17,122 --> 00:37:19,397
and I don't know what to do. I...

460
00:37:21,126 --> 00:37:23,481
I'm never gonna have a normal life.

461
00:37:25,879 --> 00:37:29,667
You can be married to anybody,
if that's what you're worried about.

462
00:37:29,924 --> 00:37:33,917
- Anybody?
- Marriage is an act of will.

463
00:37:35,637 --> 00:37:37,946
I mean, I adore Herb,

464
00:37:38,139 --> 00:37:41,688
but our marriage functions
because we will it to.

465
00:37:41,934 --> 00:37:46,371
If you leave love to hold everything
together, you can forget it.

466
00:37:46,646 --> 00:37:49,683
Love comes and goes with the breeze,
minute by minute.

467
00:37:50,858 --> 00:37:53,770
But you make it sound
all so unromantic.

468
00:37:53,985 --> 00:37:56,135
Pick any man over 50 in this room.

469
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,515
Either one of us
could be married to him.

470
00:37:59,614 --> 00:38:02,128
OK. What about that one?

471
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:08,972
He just needs his routines, that's all.
I bet if you anticipate his needs

472
00:38:09,247 --> 00:38:12,159
before he knows he has them,
he'll be docile as a lamb.

473
00:38:12,375 --> 00:38:16,129
And that one?

474
00:38:18,505 --> 00:38:20,655
He needs a lot of praise,

475
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,991
but if you stick your finger
up his ass while he's coming,

476
00:38:24,217 --> 00:38:27,687
he won't give you any trouble at all.
I'm kidding. I was kidding.

477
00:38:29,138 --> 00:38:32,608
<i>I wonder if maybe I'm having
a very quiet nervous breakdown.</i>

478
00:38:32,849 --> 00:38:36,524
- Did you get the boots?
- Yes. I mean, they're on hold.

479
00:38:36,769 --> 00:38:42,241
- But I got 'em. I did it.
- Good. Good for you. You deserve them.

480
00:39:36,108 --> 00:39:38,064
Mrs Lee?

481
00:39:47,325 --> 00:39:50,761
- I want some cigarettes.
- What kind?

482
00:39:50,995 --> 00:39:55,034
- The white ones.
- Marlboro Lights?

483
00:40:07,842 --> 00:40:10,720
Pippa.

484
00:40:10,927 --> 00:40:14,237
Oh, my God.

485
00:40:18,892 --> 00:40:20,883
It's OK.

486
00:40:22,436 --> 00:40:25,109
Would you like me to drive you home?

487
00:40:38,991 --> 00:40:41,869
Maybe you shouldn't tell anyone
about this.

488
00:40:42,077 --> 00:40:45,353
- I'll try not to.
- You'll try not to?

489
00:40:47,707 --> 00:40:50,540
It might slip out one day.

490
00:40:50,751 --> 00:40:53,424
What?

491
00:40:59,174 --> 00:41:02,883
I think I just figured out
what's so odd about you.

492
00:41:07,014 --> 00:41:09,323
You can't lie, can you?

493
00:41:17,272 --> 00:41:19,832
OK. Well, thank you.

494
00:42:00,223 --> 00:42:01,497
What's up?

495
00:42:03,225 --> 00:42:05,659
Pippa, for Christ's sakes,
I'm not dead yet.

496
00:42:08,271 --> 00:42:10,262
I'm sorry.

497
00:42:17,653 --> 00:42:19,962
<i>Aunt Trish's apartment was a haven</i>

498
00:42:20,155 --> 00:42:22,908
<i>after the hysteria
of my mother's household.</i>

499
00:42:24,283 --> 00:42:30,119
<i>I fit in easily with the two of them,
but was secretly fascinated by Kat,</i>

500
00:42:30,455 --> 00:42:33,572
<i>maybe because she seemed
a little bit dangerous.</i>

501
00:42:34,959 --> 00:42:37,712
- Bye.
- Bye, baby.

502
00:42:46,384 --> 00:42:48,852
So, chicklet... Boom, boom!

503
00:42:49,053 --> 00:42:52,568
- What's your favourite subject?
- I don't really have one.

504
00:42:52,806 --> 00:42:56,401
- Well, what do you like?
- Nothing in particular.

505
00:42:56,643 --> 00:43:00,272
- You must be good at something.
- No.

506
00:43:00,521 --> 00:43:04,036
- Well, I think you're special.
- Special how?

507
00:43:04,274 --> 00:43:06,834
Special like I can't believe
you landed in my lap.

508
00:43:07,026 --> 00:43:10,621
Almost makes me believe in destiny.

509
00:43:12,989 --> 00:43:16,299
- Hey.
- Hey. This is my friend, Shelly.

510
00:43:16,533 --> 00:43:19,127
- Wow.
- Shelly, this is Pippa.

511
00:43:19,327 --> 00:43:22,478
- You were right. She's perfect.
- Hm-hmm.

512
00:43:22,705 --> 00:43:26,414
Let's get this show on the road.
Whoo-hoo!

513
00:43:26,666 --> 00:43:29,055
So, what do I do?

514
00:43:29,252 --> 00:43:32,244
When I was in the film business,
we never asked questions.

515
00:43:32,463 --> 00:43:34,499
We just showed up
and let shit happen.

516
00:43:34,673 --> 00:43:38,825
Look at the camera like it's someone you
know and don't like. That's the secret.

517
00:43:39,093 --> 00:43:41,653
Yeah, like that. That's Kitty.

518
00:43:41,845 --> 00:43:44,917
- Who's Kitty?
- The girl in the novel she's writing.

519
00:43:45,139 --> 00:43:50,532
- That's what the pictures are for.
- Kitty is every woman's wild side.

520
00:43:50,852 --> 00:43:53,730
She's fearless.
Don't you wish you were fearless?

521
00:43:53,938 --> 00:43:56,736
- I guess so.
- Yeah, if you were,

522
00:43:56,940 --> 00:44:01,570
you wouldn't cry every time you hung up
the phone after talking to your mommy.

523
00:44:01,861 --> 00:44:06,218
- You'd forget the past.
- Is that what you do?

524
00:44:06,490 --> 00:44:10,403
I'm the girl from Pluto.
I'm a scary thing.

525
00:44:10,660 --> 00:44:12,969
- Can we get doughnuts?
- Later!

526
00:44:13,162 --> 00:44:15,881
OK, this is the scene where
Mrs Washington comes home

527
00:44:16,081 --> 00:44:19,232
- and finds you in her playpen.
- Who's Mrs Washington?

528
00:44:19,458 --> 00:44:24,407
Mrs Washington is the woman
who owns the mansion where you're at,

529
00:44:24,713 --> 00:44:28,149
and one day, you come home and you
decide to play with her kids' toys.

530
00:44:28,382 --> 00:44:30,816
OK. So, listen.
You have to be really upset,

531
00:44:31,009 --> 00:44:33,159
so I need you
to think of something sad.

532
00:44:33,344 --> 00:44:37,178
- I'm just not really feeling anything.
- No?

533
00:44:37,431 --> 00:44:39,945
OK. Let's go.

534
00:44:41,851 --> 00:44:44,319
Come on, let's go. Come on, Shell.

535
00:44:46,313 --> 00:44:49,908
Is she gonna hurt you?
No, don't let her take the baby!

536
00:44:50,149 --> 00:44:54,028
That's right, that's your baby.
Good. Yeah. That is perfect.

537
00:44:54,278 --> 00:44:56,553
Yeah, now the spanking, alright?

538
00:44:56,738 --> 00:44:59,332
- What?
- It's just... It's pretend.

539
00:45:00,491 --> 00:45:02,925
- Is this good?
- Go.

540
00:45:03,118 --> 00:45:04,710
- Ow!
- Christ!

541
00:45:04,870 --> 00:45:07,065
- Sorry!
- No, I said pretend!

542
00:45:07,246 --> 00:45:09,043
Sorry.

543
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:11,197
You alright?

544
00:45:12,542 --> 00:45:14,533
You wanna do it again?

545
00:45:16,295 --> 00:45:19,526
- Yeah.
- OK.

546
00:45:19,756 --> 00:45:21,872
Let's do another one.

547
00:45:22,050 --> 00:45:25,963
- Whoops.
- How do you feel, Kitty?

548
00:45:27,387 --> 00:45:29,537
Yeah, that's right. OK.

549
00:45:29,723 --> 00:45:32,556
Pippa, leash.
Pippa, leash, that's right.

550
00:45:32,767 --> 00:45:36,043
Go on, little puppy dog. That's great.

551
00:45:36,270 --> 00:45:39,546
<i> I let those two weeks of my life
happen because, in a way,</i>

552
00:45:39,772 --> 00:45:43,731
<i>I felt I had no choice.
That's not quite true, though.</i>

553
00:45:43,984 --> 00:45:48,500
<i>It wasn't coercion. I liked
the attention, and... Oh, I don't know.</i>

554
00:45:48,779 --> 00:45:52,772
<i>Anyway, Aunt Trish came home sick.</i>

555
00:46:09,087 --> 00:46:11,885
<i>That was the end of my stay
with Aunt Trish.</i>

556
00:46:16,051 --> 00:46:18,201
You slept late.

557
00:46:18,386 --> 00:46:21,105
I'm sorry.
It took me ages to fall asleep.

558
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:24,915
OK, I'm off.

559
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:29,093
See you at lunch. Oh, is there anything
else you want from the market

560
00:46:29,353 --> 00:46:31,742
- other than the apricot spread?
- No.

561
00:46:33,523 --> 00:46:34,638
What?

562
00:46:34,774 --> 00:46:38,084
Since we moved to the old folks' home,
you look younger and younger.

563
00:46:38,319 --> 00:46:40,708
That's cos I'm not setting my hair.

564
00:46:40,904 --> 00:46:42,576
OK.

565
00:47:02,088 --> 00:47:07,879
Chris? I'm sorry. It's Pippa Lee.
I'm so sorry to disturb you.

566
00:47:08,218 --> 00:47:11,290
I forgot I'd left my car
at the convenience store.

567
00:47:13,347 --> 00:47:15,781
I'll just wait out here. OK.

568
00:47:23,313 --> 00:47:26,703
Your mother told me
you're going through a hard time.

569
00:47:26,941 --> 00:47:30,820
You could say that.
Fired from my job at the men's shelter,

570
00:47:31,069 --> 00:47:34,744
I come home to find my wife
sitting on top of my best friend.

571
00:47:34,989 --> 00:47:37,423
Wow. That's bad.

572
00:47:37,616 --> 00:47:41,495
Yeah, well, there's probably
a good reason for it all.

573
00:47:43,037 --> 00:47:47,235
- What?
- I'm an asshole.

574
00:47:47,499 --> 00:47:49,137
You are?

575
00:47:49,292 --> 00:47:51,806
I don't know why,
I just always have been.

576
00:47:55,756 --> 00:47:59,510
That tattoo you have
must have hurt terribly.

577
00:47:59,759 --> 00:48:03,877
I tried to join a Jesuit seminary once
when I was 17.

578
00:48:04,137 --> 00:48:07,686
- You were gonna be a priest?
- Yeah.

579
00:48:09,183 --> 00:48:11,572
But they rejected my application.

580
00:48:16,439 --> 00:48:21,354
- Do you still have a vocation?
- Just the tattoo.

581
00:48:23,152 --> 00:48:25,461
What made you lose your faith?

582
00:48:28,156 --> 00:48:33,276
I stopped believing God was a mystery
you could nail down with one book,

583
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:36,967
but by that time, my parents
had written me off as a fuck-up,

584
00:48:37,205 --> 00:48:39,275
I was married to a Jesus freak,

585
00:48:39,457 --> 00:48:43,735
and I was just as pissed off at
the world as when I was a Christian,

586
00:48:44,002 --> 00:48:48,200
which brings us more or less
up to date, give or take a decade.

587
00:48:51,008 --> 00:48:53,158
What are you thinking?

588
00:48:55,595 --> 00:49:00,111
- I was thinking that you seem like...
- What?

589
00:49:00,390 --> 00:49:04,827
Just that you seem so bright. It's a
pity you never settled on any real work.

590
00:49:05,102 --> 00:49:07,741
It would make your life
so much easier.

591
00:49:09,356 --> 00:49:12,871
- OK. Well, thank you.
- I didn't mean to offend you.

592
00:49:13,109 --> 00:49:16,738
I suggest you go back to that little
life you've puffed up for yourself.

593
00:49:16,987 --> 00:49:20,821
I'm sure you're very happy
underneath all that anxiety.

594
00:49:23,992 --> 00:49:26,984
<i>You're right, you know.
You are an asshole.</i>

595
00:49:27,203 --> 00:49:30,400
Told you.

596
00:49:35,001 --> 00:49:37,037
<i> In the years after I left Trish,</i>

597
00:49:37,211 --> 00:49:40,840
<i>all I can remember
is fixes I got myself into.</i>

598
00:49:41,089 --> 00:49:43,284
<i># I will love you for a while</i>

599
00:49:43,466 --> 00:49:48,142
<i># Just how long I cannot say
Long before</i>

600
00:49:48,428 --> 00:49:51,181
<i> It was a freefall.</i>

601
00:49:54,934 --> 00:49:57,653
<i># While there's fire in your eyes</i>

602
00:49:57,853 --> 00:50:00,731
<i>Truth is, I took every pill
I could get my hands on.</i>

603
00:50:00,938 --> 00:50:04,055
<i>It's no wonder
I can't remember any of it.</i>

604
00:50:05,901 --> 00:50:09,132
<i>One day,
I found out my mother had died.</i>

605
00:50:09,362 --> 00:50:12,081
<i>I tried to remain as numb as possible.</i>

606
00:50:14,741 --> 00:50:16,732
<i>That was my boyfriend, Jed.</i>

607
00:50:19,453 --> 00:50:22,092
<i>Oh, no, it was Craig.
Craig was my boyfriend.</i>

608
00:50:22,289 --> 00:50:24,883
I can't believe you sold a painting
to Gigi Lee.

609
00:50:25,083 --> 00:50:26,994
Who is she, anyway?

610
00:50:27,168 --> 00:50:32,686
She is an heiress, collector,
party girl. She knows everybody.

611
00:50:33,006 --> 00:50:35,520
She knows Andy.

612
00:50:35,716 --> 00:50:38,230
- Hi, everybody.
- Hi.

613
00:50:41,721 --> 00:50:44,030
This is Sam Shapiro, the novelist.

614
00:50:44,223 --> 00:50:46,942
That material
belongs with the childhood.

615
00:50:47,142 --> 00:50:50,737
I know, but I'm moving back
and forth in time. It's liquid.

616
00:50:50,978 --> 00:50:53,697
Let the sequences accumulate.
They're too staccato.

617
00:50:53,897 --> 00:50:56,013
<i>I'm looking for that staccato feeling.</i>

618
00:50:56,191 --> 00:50:59,547
Hello.
Hi, are you with our party?

619
00:50:59,777 --> 00:51:02,416
Yeah, with Craig.
You bought a painting from him.

620
00:51:02,613 --> 00:51:05,411
Oh, yeah. This is Max, I'm Herb.

621
00:51:05,615 --> 00:51:08,846
- And you are?
- Pippa Sarkissian.

622
00:51:09,076 --> 00:51:11,909
- What kind of a name is that?
- English and Armenian.

623
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:16,636
Ah. Well, welcome.

624
00:51:19,751 --> 00:51:25,269
You don't have a bathing suit?
Go naked! Nobody's here! Come on!

625
00:51:25,589 --> 00:51:28,103
Come on!

626
00:51:54,028 --> 00:51:59,500
I'm so happy to see you. I want
to organise a show in Paris for you.

627
00:51:59,825 --> 00:52:02,339
Have you been in Paris before?

628
00:52:04,078 --> 00:52:06,069
That's fantastic.

629
00:52:17,380 --> 00:52:19,371
What's going on?

630
00:52:30,891 --> 00:52:35,601
Pippa. Pippa Sarkissian.
Come here. Come.

631
00:52:37,938 --> 00:52:40,577
Sit. Talk to us.

632
00:52:42,776 --> 00:52:48,169
So, Pippa, what does a free spirit
like you have for breakfast usually?

633
00:52:48,488 --> 00:52:51,844
- Does she look like she eats breakfast?
- Do you?

634
00:52:53,576 --> 00:52:56,010
- No.
- That's your first mistake of the day.

635
00:52:56,203 --> 00:52:58,922
So, first thing in the morning,
you go to the studio?

636
00:52:59,122 --> 00:53:00,919
I don't have a studio.

637
00:53:01,082 --> 00:53:03,357
You gotta be an artist
dressed like that.

638
00:53:03,542 --> 00:53:06,898
- Well, what do you do?
- I work in a clothing store.

639
00:53:07,128 --> 00:53:09,084
You have no ambition?

640
00:53:11,173 --> 00:53:15,007
No one has ever walked through that
door before without having an ambition.

641
00:53:15,260 --> 00:53:17,296
The butler is writing a short story.

642
00:53:17,470 --> 00:53:20,507
- He told me so himself yesterday.
- I'm gonna get a drink.

643
00:53:20,722 --> 00:53:22,713
- You want a drink, Pippa?
- Uh-uh.

644
00:53:22,891 --> 00:53:27,123
- Get me another one of these.
- I will. I'll be back.

645
00:53:30,897 --> 00:53:34,253
This is the most amazing house
I've ever seen.

646
00:53:34,483 --> 00:53:36,758
It's not a house, it's a mausoleum.

647
00:53:36,944 --> 00:53:41,176
There isn't one comfortable
piece of furniture except this couch.

648
00:53:41,447 --> 00:53:44,757
- It's like living in an aquarium.
- Then why do you live here?

649
00:53:44,992 --> 00:53:49,747
My wife. I could never afford a place
like this, although I'm not poor.

650
00:53:51,288 --> 00:53:55,566
So, Pippa, when are you going to start
doing something about your life?

651
00:53:55,834 --> 00:53:57,426
What do you mean?

652
00:53:57,585 --> 00:54:00,053
Doesn't it get dispiriting
being so aimless?

653
00:54:00,254 --> 00:54:03,451
I mean, the times,
they are a-changing notwithstanding.

654
00:54:07,635 --> 00:54:09,114
What?

655
00:54:10,637 --> 00:54:13,515
You have such a sweetness about you.

656
00:54:15,558 --> 00:54:18,470
No, I'm not sweet.

657
00:54:18,685 --> 00:54:22,644
Well, you can be experienced
and have a sweetness about you.

658
00:54:22,897 --> 00:54:26,333
It's an innate thing with you, it seems.

659
00:54:29,444 --> 00:54:34,074
I haven't seen that quality in a person
in a long time.

660
00:54:34,364 --> 00:54:36,798
We're all going swimming!

661
00:54:38,993 --> 00:54:40,312
Oh, God.

662
00:54:40,453 --> 00:54:43,889
<i> I didn't realise it yet,
but I had set my sights on Herb,</i>

663
00:54:44,122 --> 00:54:46,113
<i>and once that happened, watch out.</i>

664
00:54:46,290 --> 00:54:49,885
She's making me nostalgic
for his first wife,

665
00:54:50,127 --> 00:54:52,516
and trust me, that's saying something.

666
00:54:54,172 --> 00:54:57,323
You're interesting, Pippa.
I've been observing you.

667
00:54:57,549 --> 00:55:02,418
- You have?
- You're like an ingénue femme fatale.

668
00:55:04,180 --> 00:55:08,173
- OK, and what are you like?
- Writers are vampires.

669
00:55:08,433 --> 00:55:11,903
I'm waiting for the right girl to come
along and make me a human being.

670
00:55:13,771 --> 00:55:16,683
You realise that if I leaned in
right now and kissed you,

671
00:55:16,898 --> 00:55:20,049
I'd be the third guy tonight.
Am I right?

672
00:55:21,819 --> 00:55:24,174
Yeah, you would.

673
00:55:38,123 --> 00:55:40,956
- Your turn.
- Alright.

674
00:55:44,253 --> 00:55:45,891
Come on!

675
00:55:47,172 --> 00:55:49,970
- There you go. Thanks.
- See you next week.

676
00:55:50,175 --> 00:55:51,654
Next?

677
00:55:54,803 --> 00:55:56,794
Fish tonight?

678
00:55:57,847 --> 00:56:02,921
Oh! Well, he, erm, comes all the way
from Maine every Thursday.

679
00:56:04,645 --> 00:56:08,320
- You feel guilty about the fish man?
- A little.

680
00:56:10,691 --> 00:56:14,127
- I'm sorry about the other day.
- Oh, that's alright.

681
00:56:16,237 --> 00:56:19,513
- How are you doing?
- Oh, fine.

682
00:56:20,866 --> 00:56:24,575
I-I actually went to see someone
about the sleepwalking,

683
00:56:24,827 --> 00:56:28,536
<i>and he basically thinks I'm off my nut,
basically.</i>

684
00:56:28,789 --> 00:56:31,587
Erm, see, it's a psychiatrist.

685
00:56:31,791 --> 00:56:35,500
That's because he thinks I'm gonna need
medication, and a locksmith.

686
00:56:35,753 --> 00:56:38,745
He suggested that we bolt
the bedroom door from the inside

687
00:56:38,963 --> 00:56:40,840
and Herb hide the key, and erm...

688
00:56:41,007 --> 00:56:46,127
<i>Oh, I'm supposed to take up a hobby.
I'm thinking bowling.</i>

689
00:56:47,929 --> 00:56:51,205
- Would you like to go for a drive?
- Sure.

690
00:56:51,432 --> 00:56:53,502
After you get your fish.

691
00:56:55,143 --> 00:56:57,418
I'll make pasta.

692
00:56:58,562 --> 00:57:00,757
Where do you want to go?

693
00:57:03,233 --> 00:57:06,305
<i>I don't know.  Erm...</i>

694
00:57:06,527 --> 00:57:10,361
- I could show you where I grew up.
- OK.

695
00:57:13,408 --> 00:57:15,205
How do I get there?

696
00:57:15,367 --> 00:57:20,441
It's straight for a couple of miles.
Then we'll make a turn. I'll tell you.

697
00:57:20,747 --> 00:57:23,056
It's close.

698
00:57:23,749 --> 00:57:25,421
There it is.

699
00:57:33,924 --> 00:57:37,473
- Seems so small.
- Is your family still here?

700
00:57:39,136 --> 00:57:41,127
No.

701
00:57:46,517 --> 00:57:49,748
That's my daughter, Grace. She hates me.

702
00:57:52,355 --> 00:57:54,152
I wonder...

703
00:57:55,566 --> 00:57:58,717
- What?
- If I got it all wrong with her.

704
00:58:00,278 --> 00:58:03,350
I just didn't want to suffocate her
the way my...

705
00:58:05,866 --> 00:58:10,303
I think it happens like that in families
sometimes, though.

706
00:58:10,578 --> 00:58:14,366
You just keep swinging back and forth
from generation to generation,

707
00:58:14,623 --> 00:58:18,013
getting it wrong, the opposite way.

708
00:58:21,670 --> 00:58:23,979
It was so simple with Ben.

709
00:58:27,133 --> 00:58:31,649
But you know, she, erm,
is a photographic journalist.

710
00:58:31,928 --> 00:58:35,967
Travels all over the world, wherever
it's exploding, takes photographs.

711
00:58:36,223 --> 00:58:37,895
- Wow.
- Yeah, I know.

712
00:58:38,058 --> 00:58:40,208
We must have done something right.

713
00:58:43,021 --> 00:58:45,171
Sounds like your daughter's like you.

714
00:58:47,357 --> 00:58:51,066
- Why?
- You said you were always in a drama.

715
00:58:54,029 --> 00:58:56,782
Well, I was reckless with my life,
that's true.

716
00:59:07,165 --> 00:59:09,281
I never saw her again.

717
00:59:12,044 --> 00:59:14,399
- Who?
- My mother.

718
00:59:14,587 --> 00:59:17,977
After I ran away, she died.
She had a heart attack.

719
00:59:20,801 --> 00:59:22,996
Oh, I can't wait to see.

720
00:59:25,388 --> 00:59:27,379
<i> If I could have anything,</i>

721
00:59:27,556 --> 00:59:30,468
<i>I would ask for one more afternoon
with my mother.</i>

722
00:59:30,683 --> 00:59:32,958
Look at her eyes.

723
00:59:33,144 --> 00:59:35,294
<i> I would be kind.</i>

724
00:59:35,479 --> 00:59:37,470
Beautiful.

725
00:59:45,112 --> 00:59:47,387
I've been going to Dot's pottery class.

726
00:59:47,572 --> 00:59:51,611
- Oh, good.
- Why do you think it's good?

727
00:59:51,867 --> 00:59:54,586
The doctor said
he thought you could use a hobby.

728
01:00:01,875 --> 01:00:04,992
- Tell me what you like about me.
- Right now?

729
01:00:05,211 --> 01:00:07,202
Yeah.

730
01:00:08,589 --> 01:00:11,581
- You put up with me, for one thing.
- That's it?

731
01:00:11,799 --> 01:00:13,994
Of course not.

732
01:00:16,595 --> 01:00:21,988
Herb, what happened to us? We used to
laugh so much. What happened?

733
01:00:22,308 --> 01:00:25,618
- Can't laugh all the time.
- Well, we have to laugh.

734
01:00:25,852 --> 01:00:27,968
- Or what?
- Or she died for nothing.

735
01:00:28,146 --> 01:00:31,104
- Not that again, OK?
- Why am I not allowed to mention her?

736
01:00:31,315 --> 01:00:35,228
I will not let this marriage turn into
a guilt fest. We have been through this.

737
01:00:35,485 --> 01:00:38,522
She was crazy. You get involved
with somebody like that,

738
01:00:38,738 --> 01:00:42,253
it's like putting your hand
in a blender. Your fingers get bloody.

739
01:00:42,491 --> 01:00:45,244
I just can't take it, I can't take it.
I keep seeing her.

740
01:00:45,451 --> 01:00:47,840
I keep seeing her. I keep...

741
01:00:49,371 --> 01:00:53,159
I keep seeing the past.
The past just keeps caving in.

742
01:00:54,542 --> 01:00:58,501
<i>I can't take it any more.
I can't take it.  I'm sorry.</i>

743
01:01:03,966 --> 01:01:06,639
Maybe you should be taking
antidepressants.

744
01:01:11,597 --> 01:01:13,110
What?

745
01:01:20,771 --> 01:01:23,569
You alright? You want to talk?

746
01:01:23,773 --> 01:01:26,651
My mother used to do this.
She'd suddenly disappear,

747
01:01:26,859 --> 01:01:30,374
and I'd find her on the bed in front of
the TV with toast on her belly.

748
01:01:30,612 --> 01:01:33,251
- That's how she died.
- Yes, I know.

749
01:01:34,824 --> 01:01:37,702
- I have to take your blood pressure.
- No, you don't.

750
01:01:53,756 --> 01:01:57,431
<i> I slept for a week
after the party at Herb's beach house.</i>

751
01:02:00,803 --> 01:02:03,556
<i>Maybe I was trying to avoid
my next boyfriend.</i>

752
01:02:06,099 --> 01:02:09,694
<i>When I woke up, I felt an overwhelming
need to hear Herb's voice.</i>

753
01:02:11,228 --> 01:02:14,186
<i>I missed him so much. It was strange.</i>

754
01:02:53,511 --> 01:02:55,900
<i> Hello?</i>

755
01:02:56,097 --> 01:03:01,490
<i>- Er, Mr Lee? Hi, it's Pippa Sarkissian.
- Pippa!</i>

756
01:03:01,810 --> 01:03:06,326
Hey. I-I was wondering,
do you want to go out to breakfast?

757
01:03:06,605 --> 01:03:12,202
<i>- It's three o'clock in the afternoon.
- I meant tomorrow.</i>

758
01:03:14,778 --> 01:03:18,691
<i> He treated me like a pal
at first. He was avuncular.</i>

759
01:03:18,948 --> 01:03:22,907
<i>He teased me about being a waster.
I called him an old fart.</i>

760
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:27,312
<i>We would get together every couple of
days and take a walk or eat something.</i>

761
01:03:27,580 --> 01:03:31,493
<i>He gave me reading lists.
He wanted to educate me.</i>

762
01:03:33,210 --> 01:03:36,247
- Hey. Sorry I'm late.
- You're always late.

763
01:03:36,462 --> 01:03:39,022
Well, maybe you're always early.

764
01:03:40,299 --> 01:03:44,690
I bought something for you.
Now, you only have to wear this once.

765
01:03:44,969 --> 01:03:47,324
I'll be alone at the beach house
this weekend,

766
01:03:47,513 --> 01:03:50,710
and I want you to come for lunch.

767
01:03:50,932 --> 01:03:53,844
- You weren't supposed to buy this.
- I needed to.

768
01:03:54,060 --> 01:03:58,815
<i> I loved being with Herb.
He made me feel protected.</i>

769
01:03:59,105 --> 01:04:00,936
<i> I thought I was a writer.</i>

770
01:04:01,107 --> 01:04:05,146
I thought it was my calling,
but it just wasn't. I, er...

771
01:04:06,695 --> 01:04:08,287
I-I couldn't flow.

772
01:04:08,446 --> 01:04:12,917
I have a very critical nature,
and it kept me from being able to flow.

773
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:18,433
Then I... was slightly lost for a while.
I had no idea what I was gonna do,

774
01:04:18,746 --> 01:04:22,864
and I had a friend in the publishing
business, and he offered me a job.

775
01:04:23,124 --> 01:04:25,354
- And here I am.
- Hmm.

776
01:04:30,797 --> 01:04:32,947
Tell me what you like about me.

777
01:04:35,301 --> 01:04:39,533
Well, you're not a show-off about it,
but I think you're very intelligent,

778
01:04:39,804 --> 01:04:44,002
and... you're beautiful,
but you're cool about it,

779
01:04:44,266 --> 01:04:47,224
and there's a sadness about you,

780
01:04:47,435 --> 01:04:51,826
and I like that, in moderation.

781
01:04:53,399 --> 01:04:57,915
- I like your jacket.
- And that's it?

782
01:04:59,111 --> 01:05:01,386
No.

783
01:05:01,572 --> 01:05:04,484
No, I...

784
01:05:06,701 --> 01:05:09,420
I like your face and your voice...

785
01:05:10,621 --> 01:05:13,931
<i>...and, erm...</i>

786
01:05:14,165 --> 01:05:17,157
- This is gonna sound strange.
- Say it.

787
01:05:19,086 --> 01:05:21,077
It's like, erm...

788
01:05:22,672 --> 01:05:25,584
Like I can feel what you're feeling.

789
01:05:25,799 --> 01:05:30,395
You know, if you feel nervous
or happy or sad, I can feel it.

790
01:05:31,929 --> 01:05:34,648
I-In my body, in my fingers.

791
01:05:36,099 --> 01:05:39,853
- What a remarkable thing.
- Oh.

792
01:05:40,102 --> 01:05:43,458
I'd like you not to feel as if you have
to censor yourself around me.

793
01:05:43,689 --> 01:05:47,887
Tell me something about yourself. Tell
me the most important thing about you.

794
01:05:51,528 --> 01:05:53,678
I'm a fuck-up.

795
01:06:01,661 --> 01:06:05,017
<i> I felt like I was being
rescued from a burning wreck.</i>

796
01:06:05,247 --> 01:06:07,602
If I'm good for anything in the world,

797
01:06:07,791 --> 01:06:10,669
it's for letting you know
how wonderful you are.

798
01:06:14,088 --> 01:06:16,443
You're my true wife, you know?

799
01:06:17,799 --> 01:06:21,917
No, you don't want me.
I only make people sad.

800
01:06:22,178 --> 01:06:24,248
I don't believe that.

801
01:06:27,557 --> 01:06:30,788
Anyway, you have a wife.

802
01:06:32,394 --> 01:06:37,104
If I have to live with that lunatic
for another week, I'll hang myself.

803
01:06:37,398 --> 01:06:40,674
For years, I've hoped she'd have
an affair so I can walk out on her,

804
01:06:40,901 --> 01:06:44,450
but she won't do it, the bitch.

805
01:06:56,246 --> 01:07:02,162
Mrs Lee still seems unwilling to work
her way up like the rest of us.

806
01:07:04,378 --> 01:07:09,088
- Oh, go stick it up your ass.
- What did you say to me?

807
01:07:16,763 --> 01:07:18,640
I don't understand.

808
01:07:18,806 --> 01:07:21,195
She agrees to divorce
if we have lunch with her?

809
01:07:21,391 --> 01:07:24,064
She wants to make the switch
in an elegant way.

810
01:07:24,269 --> 01:07:26,544
I can't believe you agreed to this!

811
01:07:26,729 --> 01:07:29,402
I owe her this much. Come on, let's go.

812
01:07:29,606 --> 01:07:31,995
Hello, Mr Lee. Nice to see you.
Hello, miss.

813
01:07:32,192 --> 01:07:34,660
- Hello, Alphonsa.
- Welcome.

814
01:07:34,860 --> 01:07:37,738
Hi, hi. Hello, hello, hello.

815
01:07:42,867 --> 01:07:45,222
- Hi.
- Sam! What a pleasant surprise.

816
01:07:45,410 --> 01:07:47,640
I told Ursa to bring in the champagne.

817
01:07:47,829 --> 01:07:50,423
- Perfect symmetry.
- What?

818
01:07:50,623 --> 01:07:55,413
- Come on.
- She invited me for lunch.

819
01:07:57,628 --> 01:08:00,188
Stop! Cheers.

820
01:08:05,009 --> 01:08:10,527
- Oh. You're such a baby.
- Thanks.

821
01:08:10,847 --> 01:08:14,396
<i> Let's face it,
I wanted Gigi's life at that moment.</i>

822
01:08:14,642 --> 01:08:16,633
<i>It wasn't the money, exactly.</i>

823
01:08:16,810 --> 01:08:19,722
<i>It was just that the money
made everything seem alright.</i>

824
01:08:19,938 --> 01:08:24,170
<i>It was the opposite of chaos,
of everything I had known up until then.</i>

825
01:08:24,441 --> 01:08:26,432
<i>I wanted to be sheltered at last.</i>

826
01:08:29,737 --> 01:08:33,047
- Madam.
- Lunch is served.

827
01:08:33,282 --> 01:08:34,351
Oh, my.

828
01:08:36,785 --> 01:08:38,218
Pippa?

829
01:08:39,328 --> 01:08:40,807
Herb.

830
01:08:43,874 --> 01:08:46,627
This lunch is in honour
of telling it like it is.

831
01:08:47,752 --> 01:08:50,107
You know how we all eat chops
and hamburgers,

832
01:08:50,295 --> 01:08:53,412
and we don't think of the faces
of who gets killed?

833
01:08:55,091 --> 01:08:58,401
- Anybody here a vegetarian?
- Here's the truth as I see it.

834
01:08:58,635 --> 01:09:03,789
- A pig for a cow. A fair exchange.
- And who's who?

835
01:09:04,890 --> 01:09:07,643
- Sorry.
- OK, let's have lunch. Who wants pig?

836
01:09:07,851 --> 01:09:10,285
- First, a toast.
- Aw, jeez!

837
01:09:11,396 --> 01:09:13,387
To transformation.

838
01:09:27,575 --> 01:09:28,974
Put the gun down.

839
01:09:30,828 --> 01:09:32,819
Put it down.

840
01:09:34,664 --> 01:09:36,700
Put it down, Gigi.

841
01:09:37,958 --> 01:09:40,677
Isn't it funny how men
always marry women

842
01:09:40,877 --> 01:09:45,155
who are easier and easier to dominate,
until they end up with an imbecile?

843
01:09:45,423 --> 01:09:48,017
Put the gun down.

844
01:09:50,593 --> 01:09:52,584
Put it down.

845
01:10:00,143 --> 01:10:02,577
Give me the... No!

846
01:10:21,743 --> 01:10:24,541
<i> Her image would haunt me
for the rest of my life.</i>

847
01:10:28,290 --> 01:10:31,600
<i>I knew without thinking
that not only would I marry Herb,</i>

848
01:10:31,835 --> 01:10:34,747
<i>I would give myself to him,
like a penitent.</i>

849
01:10:36,171 --> 01:10:39,004
<i>This was my last chance at goodness.</i>

850
01:10:39,215 --> 01:10:42,571
<i>If I fucked this up,
I would be fallen forever.</i>

851
01:10:42,802 --> 01:10:47,592
<i>Every day I tried to be good,
to erase the past.</i>

852
01:10:47,889 --> 01:10:50,323
<i>I stopped getting high.</i>

853
01:10:50,516 --> 01:10:53,314
<i>But I didn't know
how to be this new person.</i>

854
01:10:53,518 --> 01:10:57,830
<i>Like a dancer learning a new routine, I
relied on repetition to teach my brain.</i>

855
01:10:58,105 --> 01:11:00,255
Hello? Hello?

856
01:11:00,441 --> 01:11:02,511
Hello?

857
01:11:02,692 --> 01:11:07,527
<i>It wasn't till I had the babies though
that I really believed my own act.</i>

858
01:11:07,821 --> 01:11:11,257
<i>That was when Pippa Sarkissian
disappeared forever.</i>

859
01:11:12,867 --> 01:11:15,381
<i>That was how I became Pippa Lee.</i>

860
01:11:16,829 --> 01:11:22,506
I got thrown out of pottery class.
I got thrown out of pottery class!

861
01:11:28,797 --> 01:11:31,709
- Who is it?
- It's me.

862
01:11:31,924 --> 01:11:33,915
I'll be right there.

863
01:11:36,678 --> 01:11:40,034
- Everything OK?
- I got thrown out of pottery class.

864
01:11:40,264 --> 01:11:44,303
- Why?
- I told the teacher to screw off.

865
01:11:44,559 --> 01:11:46,868
Let me get my keys.
We'll get some coffee.

866
01:11:47,061 --> 01:11:50,053
She's a witch. She's...

867
01:11:51,106 --> 01:11:53,859
Why is this towel here, sweetheart?

868
01:11:54,067 --> 01:11:57,377
Were you eating, and you didn't
want to mess up the couch?

869
01:11:58,070 --> 01:11:59,423
No.

870
01:12:02,448 --> 01:12:03,722
What?

871
01:12:32,305 --> 01:12:36,981
- When did this start?
- Sometime after we moved here.

872
01:12:40,187 --> 01:12:46,023
I was hoping it was an affair,
but... it just isn't.

873
01:12:46,358 --> 01:12:50,909
I-I know this has got to be...
dreadful for you.

874
01:12:51,195 --> 01:12:55,871
I... I want you to have all the money.
You deserve everything.

875
01:12:56,158 --> 01:12:59,867
Thanks. Erm, well,
are you going to marry her?

876
01:13:00,119 --> 01:13:04,795
Well, at my age, it would be
pretty ridiculous, wouldn't it?

877
01:13:05,081 --> 01:13:08,869
And... I just wanna live.

878
01:13:09,126 --> 01:13:13,005
The past few years, I can feel you
starting to bury me, Pippa.

879
01:13:13,255 --> 01:13:17,726
I can feel the earth in my mouth, almost
as if you're looking forward to it.

880
01:13:18,008 --> 01:13:21,080
- How can you say that?
- I can feel you starting to pity me,

881
01:13:21,303 --> 01:13:25,740
being afraid of me.
You're already mourning. Don't deny it.

882
01:13:26,932 --> 01:13:30,083
I mean, of course, I-I am afraid
of you getting old and dying.

883
01:13:30,310 --> 01:13:32,380
It's normal to be afraid.

884
01:13:32,562 --> 01:13:35,872
Well, I don't want to be normal
or mourned. I am not a ghost!

885
01:13:36,106 --> 01:13:38,939
I wanna live!
Nobody knows when they're gonna die.

886
01:13:39,150 --> 01:13:43,382
You could die tomorrow, and fuck you
for making me feel like an old man!

887
01:13:43,654 --> 01:13:47,329
<i>But, Herb, you are an old man.</i>

888
01:13:51,952 --> 01:13:55,991
Oh, my... Oh, Sandra!

889
01:13:57,081 --> 01:13:59,231
Killing yourself
with a disposable razor.

890
01:13:59,416 --> 01:14:01,930
<i>I don't think
anyone's ever done that before.</i>

891
01:14:03,128 --> 01:14:06,040
She was in despair, you know.
She loves you.

892
01:14:06,255 --> 01:14:09,372
This first-aid kit came in handy,
didn't it?

893
01:14:14,512 --> 01:14:18,027
<i> I had the strangest feeling
walking down those stairs.</i>

894
01:14:18,265 --> 01:14:20,779
<i>I suddenly felt so light,</i>

895
01:14:20,975 --> 01:14:23,887
<i>as if a great weight
had been lifted off of me.</i>

896
01:14:36,112 --> 01:14:39,627
<i> Remember this moment,
sports fans. Remember where you were.</i>

897
01:14:39,865 --> 01:14:42,504
<i>Pippa Lee rounding the bend,
guilt baton in hand,</i>

898
01:14:42,701 --> 01:14:45,773
<i>coming up on Sandra Dulles,
and the pass is complete!</i>

899
01:14:45,995 --> 01:14:48,748
<i>Pippa Lee has passed
the guilt baton to Sandra Dulles!</i>

900
01:14:48,956 --> 01:14:51,231
<i>I never thought
I'd live to see this moment!</i>

901
01:15:25,193 --> 01:15:27,184
- Hi, there.
- Hi.

902
01:15:37,661 --> 01:15:39,652
What's going on?

903
01:15:41,748 --> 01:15:45,184
My husband has been having an affair
with a good friend of mine.

904
01:15:46,502 --> 01:15:48,493
So...

905
01:15:51,047 --> 01:15:53,720
<i>...it's official.
Nobody needs me any more.</i>

906
01:16:21,154 --> 01:16:25,067
- Hi, Ma.
- Dot!

907
01:16:26,158 --> 01:16:28,626
- Wait.
- Dot! No, no, no.

908
01:16:28,827 --> 01:16:31,819
Please, I didn't mean to upset you.
I really didn't.

909
01:16:32,038 --> 01:16:35,030
- That man is 35 years old.
- But we haven't done...

910
01:16:35,249 --> 01:16:40,926
And you are whatever you are.
It's none... It's none of my beeswax.

911
01:16:41,253 --> 01:16:44,563
It is just disappointing

912
01:16:44,798 --> 01:16:48,950
when someone turns out not to be
the person you thought they were.

913
01:16:56,057 --> 01:16:57,934
I lost control.

914
01:17:02,062 --> 01:17:05,896
I... I care about you tremendously.

915
01:17:07,274 --> 01:17:12,712
Why don't I feel anything? I mean, it
can't be that I don't love you any more.

916
01:17:13,029 --> 01:17:17,181
- I-I adored you only this morning.
- Maybe you're in shock.

917
01:17:17,449 --> 01:17:21,601
- It's all so tired.
- What is?

918
01:17:21,869 --> 01:17:25,578
This whole situation.
Let's just fast-forward to the divorce.

919
01:17:48,515 --> 01:17:50,506
<i>Where... </i>

920
01:17:54,186 --> 01:17:56,654
Where are they?

921
01:18:07,822 --> 01:18:09,813
Where were you going, Mom?

922
01:18:11,575 --> 01:18:14,169
Ben, I really don't see
that that's important.

923
01:18:14,369 --> 01:18:17,327
I just wanna get everything straight.

924
01:18:22,417 --> 01:18:26,251
I... I had chest pains.

925
01:18:28,922 --> 01:18:31,482
I feel like
the gods are punishing me.

926
01:18:31,675 --> 01:18:34,826
Oh, please stop being such an egomaniac
and drink your tea.

927
01:18:35,052 --> 01:18:37,691
You forgive me, Pippa?

928
01:18:39,097 --> 01:18:43,010
<i>- Forgive her for what?
- Oh...  I can't.</i>

929
01:18:44,727 --> 01:18:47,195
Ben, your father and Sandra were...

930
01:18:47,395 --> 01:18:49,829
They... They're in love.

931
01:18:50,023 --> 01:18:53,015
- That's why I was leaving.
- What?

932
01:18:53,233 --> 01:18:57,272
I'll jump out the window.
I'm so stupid! I'm stupid!

933
01:18:57,529 --> 01:19:00,043
I'm just so selfish!

934
01:19:00,239 --> 01:19:03,948
I'll jump out the window if you don't
forgive me. I'm so stupid!

935
01:19:04,201 --> 01:19:06,669
I forgive you. Get up.
Get up, please. OK.

936
01:19:09,288 --> 01:19:12,360
- You do not forgive her.
- You're right, I don't.

937
01:19:12,582 --> 01:19:15,016
How could Dad do that to you?

938
01:19:15,209 --> 01:19:19,168
Sweetheart, he... was afraid of dying.

939
01:19:19,421 --> 01:19:21,776
He fell in love.

940
01:19:21,965 --> 01:19:27,323
And I wasn't altogether there either,
as of late, so I don't know.

941
01:19:27,636 --> 01:19:29,149
Do you even care?

942
01:19:31,889 --> 01:19:34,244
How can I compete with that?

943
01:19:39,312 --> 01:19:42,110
- Hi. Where is he?
- Oh, sweetheart.

944
01:19:42,314 --> 01:19:44,544
Mrs Lee? You have a phone call.

945
01:19:44,733 --> 01:19:48,169
OK, Ben, will you take her in?
I'll be right back.

946
01:19:48,402 --> 01:19:49,551
Hello?

947
01:19:49,695 --> 01:19:51,925
<i> I just want to say,
in all the world,</i>

948
01:19:52,114 --> 01:19:55,709
<i>you are the one person to whom
none of this should be happening.</i>

949
01:19:55,950 --> 01:20:00,785
- Thank you, Sam.
- I also want to say that I love you.

950
01:20:01,079 --> 01:20:03,877
<i>- Me, too.
- I mean, really.</i>

951
01:20:04,082 --> 01:20:05,515
Oh.

952
01:20:08,502 --> 01:20:10,060
<i>- Call you later.
- OK.</i>

953
01:20:10,211 --> 01:20:11,326
<i>- Bye.
- Sam.</i>

954
01:20:11,462 --> 01:20:12,975
<i>Yeah?</i>

955
01:20:14,089 --> 01:20:17,638
I don't want to make butterflied lamb
any more.

956
01:20:19,636 --> 01:20:23,993
<i>- Oh.
- Do you see what I'm saying?</i>

957
01:20:29,143 --> 01:20:31,816
- Why did Ben get to stay?
- I don't know.

958
01:20:32,020 --> 01:20:34,090
He seemed to want it the most.

959
01:20:34,272 --> 01:20:39,062
Really? How do you measure that?
Do you have some sort of love-ometer?

960
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:41,351
Why don't we go home and rest?

961
01:20:41,528 --> 01:20:45,680
- Has someone been smoking in here?
- I don't know.

962
01:20:47,324 --> 01:20:48,916
Yuck.

963
01:20:50,994 --> 01:20:53,906
- Was it Daddy?
- What?

964
01:20:54,121 --> 01:20:57,113
- If Daddy's been smoking, then...
- No. No.

965
01:21:00,501 --> 01:21:04,460
So, his brain is just dead,
it's just completely dead?

966
01:21:04,713 --> 01:21:09,343
He'll never say anything ever again?
Not one thing?

967
01:21:10,760 --> 01:21:13,593
That's what the doctors
are telling us, sweetheart.

968
01:21:15,347 --> 01:21:18,419
You didn't even ask
for a second opinion.

969
01:21:28,440 --> 01:21:31,477
- Gracie, I know, sweetie...
- Goodnight.

970
01:21:44,578 --> 01:21:47,012
Why did you bother to lie?

971
01:21:53,502 --> 01:21:55,811
Oh, my God, you are smoking.

972
01:21:56,004 --> 01:21:57,676
I'm quitting soon.

973
01:22:08,597 --> 01:22:12,112
But I have never seen you smoke
in my whole life.

974
01:22:12,350 --> 01:22:14,341
I know.

975
01:22:27,112 --> 01:22:29,467
Aw.

976
01:22:29,656 --> 01:22:32,773
I'm so sorry this had to happen to you.

977
01:22:32,992 --> 01:22:36,746
I'm not crying because of Daddy.

978
01:22:39,163 --> 01:22:42,439
I'm crying because

979
01:22:42,666 --> 01:22:47,581
I'm so mean to you, all the time,
and I hate it.

980
01:22:47,879 --> 01:22:50,313
- Aw.
- And I don't want to be.

981
01:22:50,506 --> 01:22:54,897
<i>I really, really, really don't. </i>

982
01:22:58,887 --> 01:23:02,482
Sweetheart, it's not your fault.

983
01:23:02,724 --> 01:23:05,192
There's so many things
you don't know about me.

984
01:23:05,392 --> 01:23:07,383
No, not yet.

985
01:23:12,315 --> 01:23:15,546
I want to be your friend,

986
01:23:15,776 --> 01:23:18,085
because...

987
01:23:18,278 --> 01:23:21,793
Because... we still have time.

988
01:23:24,699 --> 01:23:28,897
- I'd be honoured to be your friend.
- No, not honoured.

989
01:23:29,161 --> 01:23:34,952
- Just happy.
- OK, happy.

990
01:23:35,291 --> 01:23:37,964
Mom.

991
01:24:02,063 --> 01:24:05,612
I saw your light on.
I wanted to see if you needed anything.

992
01:24:05,857 --> 01:24:08,087
My mom told me what happened.

993
01:24:08,276 --> 01:24:11,552
Oh. My son is at the hospital,

994
01:24:11,779 --> 01:24:14,134
and I'm supposed to be resting,
but I can't.

995
01:24:16,574 --> 01:24:20,965
I could drive you around a little bit.
Do they have your cell?

996
01:24:22,912 --> 01:24:26,109
- Don't you have work?
- I'm off till five.

997
01:24:28,417 --> 01:24:30,453
I could write Grace a note.

998
01:24:34,130 --> 01:24:35,722
OK.

999
01:24:49,183 --> 01:24:50,935
I'm leaving soon.

1000
01:24:52,686 --> 01:24:55,120
And where will you go?

1001
01:24:55,313 --> 01:24:57,269
Back out west, I guess.

1002
01:25:04,946 --> 01:25:07,460
What do you pray for when you pray?

1003
01:25:08,866 --> 01:25:11,061
For my kids to be happy, I guess.

1004
01:25:12,619 --> 01:25:14,814
And to be good.

1005
01:25:15,663 --> 01:25:18,416
It sounds so childish,
saying it out loud.

1006
01:25:19,916 --> 01:25:24,944
- Do you want to pray for your husband?
- It's hopeless.

1007
01:25:27,756 --> 01:25:32,432
- His brain is dead.
- Not for his brain.

1008
01:25:32,718 --> 01:25:34,709
For his soul.

1009
01:25:35,929 --> 01:25:38,363
- I don't know how to do that.
- Me, neither.

1010
01:25:39,348 --> 01:25:41,145
Let's try.

1011
01:27:51,662 --> 01:27:53,141
Sorry.

1012
01:28:38,324 --> 01:28:40,121
OK, Herb...

1013
01:28:41,577 --> 01:28:43,568
<i>...I'm gonna let you go.</i>

1014
01:28:48,874 --> 01:28:52,344
I'm sure you're pissed as it is
that I've left you like this so long,

1015
01:28:52,585 --> 01:28:54,815
but we wanted to wait for Grace.

1016
01:29:09,390 --> 01:29:11,665
I love you anyway, you know?

1017
01:29:18,856 --> 01:29:21,165
I'll always love you, you bastard.

1018
01:29:23,443 --> 01:29:25,434
Are you ready now?

1019
01:30:26,702 --> 01:30:29,057
<i>OK, it's time to turn the corner.</i>

1020
01:30:29,246 --> 01:30:31,919
<i>I'm going to stay with Ben
and his girlfriend in town.</i>

1021
01:30:32,123 --> 01:30:34,318
I'm gonna find a place near them,

1022
01:30:34,500 --> 01:30:37,890
and I'm gonna wait
to become a grandmother.

1023
01:31:39,218 --> 01:31:41,209
I'm awake.

1024
01:31:48,767 --> 01:31:53,682
- Hi, Momma.
- I'm going on a trip.

1025
01:31:53,980 --> 01:31:55,891
- A trip?
- Yes.

1026
01:31:56,065 --> 01:32:00,343
And I was wondering if you could
call these movers right here,

1027
01:32:00,610 --> 01:32:02,123
and take whatever you want,

1028
01:32:02,278 --> 01:32:05,748
and then tell them to give the rest
to goodwill. That would be great.

1029
01:32:05,989 --> 01:32:07,786
What about the memorial service?

1030
01:32:07,949 --> 01:32:11,021
Right, just call everybody on here
except for Sandra,

1031
01:32:11,243 --> 01:32:13,803
and just call me on my cell
and give me the date.

1032
01:32:13,996 --> 01:32:16,556
And you know what?
What the hell. Invite Sandra.

1033
01:32:16,748 --> 01:32:19,262
Mom, are you actually leaving?

1034
01:32:19,458 --> 01:32:22,097
- I'll be back.
- When?

1035
01:32:22,294 --> 01:32:25,730
Your father was in love with a woman
I cooked for two days a week

1036
01:32:25,963 --> 01:32:31,674
over the past four years. I am not going
to organise his memorial service.

1037
01:32:35,054 --> 01:32:37,363
- Who is that guy?
- He's my friend.

1038
01:32:37,556 --> 01:32:42,835
- A friend? What's going on?
- I'm not driving off into the sunset.

1039
01:32:43,144 --> 01:32:46,853
- I'm just seeing what happens next.
- I can't believe this is happening.

1040
01:32:47,105 --> 01:32:51,940
She's given us half her life.
Don't you think she deserves a vacation?

1041
01:33:04,286 --> 01:33:06,641
I love you, I love you, I love you.

1042
01:33:11,291 --> 01:33:14,124
<i> I don't know
how the rest of my story will go.</i>

1043
01:33:14,335 --> 01:33:16,565
<i>I don't know who I'll be in it.</i>

1044
01:33:17,796 --> 01:33:21,675
<i>All I know is
I feel like this is just the beginning.</i>

1045
01:33:38,646 --> 01:33:40,876
<i># I think I lost it</i>

1046
01:33:41,065 --> 01:33:44,102
<i># Let me know if you come across it</i>

1047
01:33:44,317 --> 01:33:49,345
<i># Let me know if I let it fall
along a back road somewhere</i>

1048
01:33:51,782 --> 01:33:54,376
<i># Money can't replace it</i>

1049
01:33:54,576 --> 01:33:57,613
<i># No memory can erase it</i>

1050
01:33:57,828 --> 01:34:02,458
<i># And I know I'm never gonna find
another one to compare</i>

1051
01:34:04,876 --> 01:34:07,993
<i># Give me some love to fill me up</i>

1052
01:34:08,212 --> 01:34:11,329
<i># Give me some time, give me some stuff</i>

1053
01:34:11,547 --> 01:34:12,980
