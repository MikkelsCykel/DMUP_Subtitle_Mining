Eh? Eh?

My seed, eh?

13
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:42,724
Is that what you think?

Here. Take your end.

15
00:03:15,595 --> 00:03:17,028

16
00:03:17,096 --> 00:03:18,393
That,s it.
Watch it.

17
00:03:18,498 --> 00:03:19,430
Go ahead.

18
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:20,488
That,s it.

19
00:03:22,101 --> 00:03:23,193
Gentle.

21
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:43,018
Nothing.

22
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:55,033
Did he hit you?

23
00:03:56,436 --> 00:03:58,870
Shame on you
for leng him.

24
00:03:58,938 --> 00:04:02,101
His father was
my father,s journean.

00:04:08,815 --> 00:04:09,782

40
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:38,902

41
00:05:38,938 --> 00:05:40,405
So am I.

42
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,806
Where are you
going, sir?

43
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:44,399
Chrisinster.

44
00:05:44,444 --> 00:05:47,607
Why do you
have to go?

45
00:05:59,225 --> 00:06:01,090
Do you see it?

46
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,457
Over there.

47
00:06:14,273 --> 00:06:16,207
everything else
for a while.

48
00:06:16,275 --> 00:06:18,300
You have to read
your books

49
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:20,778
when your friends
are out playing,

50
00:06:25,485 --> 00:06:28,420
study every chance
you get.

51
00:06:28,488 --> 00:06:30,513
One day,
it,ll all pay off.

52
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:31,989
I promise you.

53
00:06:32,024 --> 00:06:33,491
Once you,re there,

54
00:06:33,526 --> 00:06:35,187
everything,s
open to you.

55
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:37,423
You can become
anything you want.

56
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:40,694
You can choose
your future.

57
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:52,438
Man: Dinner.

58
00:06:53,713 --> 00:06:55,044
Hurry upJude.

59
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:11,753

60
00:07:11,864 --> 00:07:13,559
You staying and
eating with us todayJude?

61
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:14,598
No.

62
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:15,599
Thank you.

63
00:07:15,668 --> 00:07:16,896
Whoa, look
at thatJude.

64
00:07:16,969 --> 00:07:18,402
Have a piece of this cheese,
Jude. You,ll love it.

65
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:20,063
Who have you
got waiting, then?

66
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:21,767
A chip off
the old block, eh?

67
00:07:48,901 --> 00:07:50,835
"Swiftly she rose
from the gray sea

68
00:07:50,903 --> 00:07:52,495
like a mist. "

69
00:08:04,784 --> 00:08:05,773
Ow!

70
00:08:18,564 --> 00:08:19,963
Here,s the poet.

71
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:29,572
Nor me.

72
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:30,664
Anny.

73
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:34,471
None ofyou
threw it.

74
00:08:37,383 --> 00:08:38,475
He,s all right.

75
00:08:43,623 --> 00:08:45,318
A w, he,s shy.

76
00:08:47,927 --> 00:08:49,792
Bet you think
I threw it.

77
00:08:51,731 --> 00:08:52,823
No.

78
00:08:52,932 --> 00:08:54,297
Well, I did.

79
00:08:55,401 --> 00:08:57,392
But don,t tell anyone.

80
00:08:59,305 --> 00:09:00,670
My name,s Arabella.

81
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:03,265
My father,s a pig breeder.

82
00:09:03,342 --> 00:09:06,038
We were washing innards
for black pudding.

83
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:11,883
What?

84
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:13,043
Nothing.

85
00:09:14,787 --> 00:09:16,254
I don,t work Sundays.

86
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:18,257
You can see me then.

87
00:10:18,651 --> 00:10:19,743
Nothin, else?

88
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:30,925
some of the Greek
Testament.

89
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:32,429
Hoity toity.

90
00:10:33,866 --> 00:10:35,333
Well, I need to,

91
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:36,858
if I,m going to get
into Christminster.

92
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:38,436
Ha ha!
Christminster?

93
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:41,929
Yes. I,m going
to be a scholar,

94
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:44,169
maybe even
a professor one day.

95
00:10:44,243 --> 00:10:46,177
My, my.

96
00:10:46,245 --> 00:10:48,645
You ever seen me
climb a tree?

97
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:49,943
No.

98
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:58,146
A!

99
00:11:07,299 --> 00:11:08,789
Jude: I,lljust
tell him.

100
00:11:08,901 --> 00:11:10,334
Arabella: We didn,t
do anything.

101
00:11:33,926 --> 00:11:35,223
Where are you?

102
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:45,937
Get up, Abby.

103
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:47,130
Why?

104
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:56,046
Be careful.

105
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,334
It,s natural for a woman

106
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,233
to bring a live thing
into the world.

107
00:13:11,023 --> 00:13:12,786
Aunt Drusilla:
Jude.

108
00:13:13,893 --> 00:13:15,383
Yes?

109
00:13:15,427 --> 00:13:17,588
It,s late.

110
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:41,816
To the bride
and the groom.

111
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:48,859
Lisa.
What?

112
00:13:48,928 --> 00:13:50,361
Pass that
to Aunt Drusilla.

113
00:13:50,462 --> 00:13:51,520
Aunt Drusilla.

114
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:53,154
This is for Aunt Drusilla.

115
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:05,707
What shall we
call her?

116
00:14:05,778 --> 00:14:06,710
Rosie,s pick.

117
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:07,711
Rosie, what?

118
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,008
What about
Jemima Spot?

119
00:14:09,081 --> 00:14:10,207
Jemima Spot.
Do you like that?

120
00:14:49,755 --> 00:14:51,620
Jude: It isn,t
your own?

121
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,055
So?

122
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:56,820
What?

123
00:14:56,862 --> 00:14:58,523
Haven,t you got enough
ofyour own hair?

124
00:15:04,603 --> 00:15:06,161
Don,t you like it?

125
00:15:06,272 --> 00:15:07,296
No.

126
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:09,067
Then I won,t wear it.

127
00:15:17,116 --> 00:15:18,481
Leave it on.

128
00:15:22,888 --> 00:15:24,412
I want to see us.

129
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:27,220
You can close your eyes
ifyou like...

130
00:15:27,293 --> 00:15:29,386
and pretend it,s dark.

131
00:15:37,036 --> 00:15:38,128
Jude.

132
00:15:40,406 --> 00:15:41,896
Ask me nicely.

133
00:15:42,007 --> 00:15:43,304
Ask you what?

134
00:15:43,342 --> 00:15:44,934
Whatever you
want me to do.

135
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:46,739
I don,t know.

136
00:16:14,773 --> 00:16:16,570
A!

137
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,899
He,s never gonna get here.

138
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:46,827
He,s probably
bloody drunk.

139
00:16:52,911 --> 00:16:55,641
We,lljust have
to do it ourselves.

140
00:17:01,286 --> 00:17:03,652
Be careful
with those.

141
00:19:10,883 --> 00:19:12,646
Aunt Drusilla:
It,s a bit late

142
00:19:23,896 --> 00:19:26,160
You should have
listened to me.

143
00:19:34,773 --> 00:19:36,206
Please don,t say that.

144
00:19:44,283 --> 00:19:46,615
Shall I get
your room ready?

145
00:19:49,788 --> 00:19:52,086
No. I,d better go.

146
00:20:55,454 --> 00:20:56,853
I knowyou think

147
00:20:59,658 --> 00:21:01,285
I really believed
I was pregnant.

148
00:22:10,195 --> 00:22:11,992
Can I help you?

149
00:22:18,704 --> 00:22:20,137
This is nice.

150
00:23:20,198 --> 00:23:22,496
It,s the same city:

151
00:23:22,534 --> 00:23:25,628
maybe a 5minute walk

152
00:23:25,704 --> 00:23:28,639
from Church Street
to Scum Street.

153
00:23:28,707 --> 00:23:31,301
Why don,t we go over?

154
00:23:32,711 --> 00:23:34,645
Why don,t we go over

155
00:23:34,713 --> 00:23:36,112
and knock on their doors?

156
00:23:36,148 --> 00:23:39,140
Because theye convinced us
this is the way it is.

157
00:23:39,217 --> 00:23:41,151
No change.

158
00:23:41,219 --> 00:23:44,120
Why change?

159
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,421
to win their argument.

160
00:24:00,071 --> 00:24:02,062
Hello. I,m looking
forJude Fawley.

161
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:06,568
Thank you.

162
00:24:17,389 --> 00:24:18,481
Jude Fawley?

163
00:24:19,691 --> 00:24:21,818
I,m your cousin
Sue Bridehead.

164
00:24:21,927 --> 00:24:23,394
Aunt Drusilla wrote
and told me

165
00:24:23,495 --> 00:24:24,826
you were in Christminster.

166
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,527
Hello.

167
00:24:32,737 --> 00:24:34,034
Don,t either ofyou
take this wrong,

168
00:24:34,105 --> 00:24:35,333
but you don,t look
like cousins to me.

169
00:24:35,407 --> 00:24:36,840
Why is that?

170
00:24:36,908 --> 00:24:38,899
Because you,re
pretty and fine,

171
00:24:38,944 --> 00:24:41,139
andJude here has got
this dour slab of stone for a face.

172
00:24:41,213 --> 00:24:42,510
A big nose is a sign
of nobility.

173
00:24:42,547 --> 00:24:44,708
Shut up, tinker.

174
00:26:30,488 --> 00:26:32,388
Are you
superstitiousJude?

175
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:33,923
No.

176
00:26:33,992 --> 00:26:35,425
Nor am I,

177
00:26:35,493 --> 00:26:36,687
but I think
it,s better to be safe.

178
00:26:36,795 --> 00:26:37,989
Don,t you?

179
00:26:43,401 --> 00:26:44,834
away from
this university.

180
00:26:44,903 --> 00:26:46,336
But it,s
wonderful here.

181
00:26:46,404 --> 00:26:47,837
It,s all stone.

182
00:26:47,906 --> 00:26:49,635
You,re talking
about the buildings.

183
00:26:49,708 --> 00:26:52,142
I,m talking
about the scholars.

184
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:54,144
I was talking
about the scholars, too.

185
00:26:58,049 --> 00:26:59,539
Thank you.

186
00:27:16,001 --> 00:27:17,059
Uh!

187
00:27:17,102 --> 00:27:18,797
Finish it.

188
00:27:29,581 --> 00:27:31,071
How much are
these 2, please?

189
00:27:31,182 --> 00:27:32,274
10 shillings.

190
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:34,308
You,re not going
to buy them?

191
00:27:34,386 --> 00:27:35,580
Why not?

192
00:27:38,289 --> 00:27:40,314
Would you like me
to wrap them up?

193
00:27:40,425 --> 00:27:41,687
No, thank you.

194
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:47,921
Why have you
wrapped them up?

195
00:27:48,033 --> 00:27:50,194
Because I don,t want
to give my landlady

196
00:28:01,446 --> 00:28:03,778
You mean like me?

197
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:06,043
I didn,t know
you were a girl.

198
00:28:23,601 --> 00:28:25,466
Do I irritate you?

199
00:28:27,172 --> 00:28:28,161
No.

200
00:28:31,076 --> 00:28:34,477
Even when I keep trying to prove
how much cleverer than you I am?

201
00:28:34,512 --> 00:28:35,911
You are.

202
00:28:37,482 --> 00:28:38,881
Don,t say that.

203
00:28:38,917 --> 00:28:41,078
Why not?

204
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:13,449
Say something.

205
00:29:33,671 --> 00:29:37,471
"Hominus similis
daeus quis chaedit ad Latin. "

206
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:42,270
Godlike the man
who sits at her side,

207
00:29:52,423 --> 00:29:54,186
Nothing is left of me

208
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:56,692
each time I see her.

209
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:20,040
Beautiful.

210
00:30:35,233 --> 00:30:37,030
Don,t know about that.

211
00:30:40,538 --> 00:30:41,835
Quite common, I hear.

212
00:30:41,873 --> 00:30:43,534
What do you think,
Jude?

213
00:30:43,575 --> 00:30:45,236
You two are cousins.

214
00:30:45,276 --> 00:30:47,335
You tell me.

215
00:30:58,957 --> 00:31:00,015
Jude: Sue?

216
00:31:05,396 --> 00:31:08,194
You,ll have to do
better than that.

217
00:31:24,515 --> 00:31:25,914
That,s Wilks.

218
00:31:34,325 --> 00:31:36,225
I had a row
with my landlady.

219
00:31:36,327 --> 00:31:39,524
She found one ofmy statues and
threw it on the floor

220
00:36:50,841 --> 00:36:52,934
Joe: Do you want
a hatJude?

221
00:36:56,414 --> 00:36:57,506
What,s the problem?

222
00:36:57,548 --> 00:36:59,982
It,s raining.

223
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:02,985
It,s what?

224
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:04,487
Have a beer.

225
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:06,546
I thought you were
the intelligent one.

226
00:37:40,491 --> 00:37:41,423
Sue!

227
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:54,787
Jude Reading: "Sir,
I,ve read your letter with interest,

228
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:56,493
"andjudging from
your description ofyourself

229
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,897
"as a working man,

230
00:39:19,056 --> 00:39:21,251
All I know is I,d lick them
on their own ground

231
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:27,797
Aye, but can you say
the creed in Latin, man?

232
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:29,856
Yes, I can!
I definitely can!

233
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:32,300
Excuse me.
Quiet, please!

234
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:33,302
Quiet!

235
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:34,565
The gentleman in the corner

236
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,280
Joe: Here,s your chance.

237
00:41:47,538 --> 00:41:48,470
Jude: Sue!

238
00:41:48,539 --> 00:41:50,131
Sue!

239
00:41:55,446 --> 00:41:57,346
Jude.

240
00:41:57,381 --> 00:41:59,281
I,ve been drinking,
Sue.

241
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:01,614
Will you let me in?

242
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:03,482
All right.

243
00:42:06,991 --> 00:42:08,015
I can do it.

244
00:42:08,092 --> 00:42:09,889
Jude.

245
00:42:14,598 --> 00:42:17,226
You,ll learn more
than they can ever teach you.

246
00:42:21,739 --> 00:42:23,798
I,m sure this is the last thing
you want to hear,

247
00:45:20,384 --> 00:45:22,875
Since when did you stop
believing in them?

248
00:45:48,912 --> 00:45:50,743
No!

249
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:14,464
Sue: DearestJude,

250
00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:21,102
He is teaching
at a new school,

251
00:46:21,211 --> 00:46:23,179
and I am studying
at a training college.

252
00:46:23,213 --> 00:46:25,681
The rules here
are strict beyond belief,

253
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:27,978
and our visiting hours
are limited,

254
00:46:28,018 --> 00:46:30,077
but I,d love
to see you again.

255
00:46:45,135 --> 00:46:46,898
Your hands are rough,
Jude.

256
00:46:56,613 --> 00:46:57,545
What,s wrong?

257
01:36:39,126 --> 01:36:42,095
We,re lookin,
for somewhere to stay.

258
01:36:42,129 --> 01:36:44,893
Don,t take children.

259
01:36:44,932 --> 01:36:47,423
We,re lookin,
for somewhere to stay.

260
01:36:47,535 --> 01:36:50,003
No. I,m sorry. No room.

261
01:37:01,949 --> 01:37:03,746
Thank you. Thank you.

262
01:38:10,985 --> 01:38:13,146
I love this place...

263
01:38:15,189 --> 01:38:18,886
even though I know it looks down
on people like me.

264
01:38:18,959 --> 01:38:20,984
The self taught,

265
01:38:21,061 --> 01:38:23,154
too determined.

266
01:38:26,367 --> 01:38:31,168
Takes 2 or 3 generations
to do what I tried to do in one.

267
01:51:34,521 --> 01:51:37,217
Do you believe in God?

268
01:51:37,257 --> 01:51:39,248
You think so? Yes.

269
01:51:50,837 --> 01:51:53,135
Ha ha ha ha.

270
01:51:53,173 --> 01:51:55,641
Ha ha ha ha ha.

271
01:52:03,683 --> 01:52:07,585
How many times have you
missed a church service in your life?

272
01:52:07,620 --> 01:52:09,588
Why?

273
01:52:22,235 --> 01:52:24,795
What are you reading
at the moment?

274
01:52:24,904 --> 01:52:27,930
Ha ha ha ha ha.

275
01:53:39,813 --> 01:53:42,111
What do you
want with me?

276
01:53:42,148 --> 01:53:43,615
Come home.

277
01:53:46,252 --> 01:53:49,153
You don,t know
my badness.

278
01:53:49,222 --> 01:53:50,712
Yes, I do.

279
01:53:51,825 --> 01:53:55,261
You make me
hate Christianity and God

280
01:53:55,361 --> 01:53:58,330
and whatever
has reduced you to this state.

281
01:54:00,500 --> 01:54:02,195
It,s right
that I suffer.

282
01:54:02,268 --> 01:54:03,667
It,s wrong...

283
01:54:03,703 --> 01:54:04,965
that a woman
like you

284
01:54:05,004 --> 01:54:05,971
should give up
her mind,

285
01:54:06,005 --> 01:54:06,972
degrade herself
like this

286
01:54:07,006 --> 01:54:09,406
Don,t talk to me
like that!

287
01:54:13,079 --> 01:54:14,671
I,m sorry.

288
01:54:19,786 --> 01:54:21,481
Come home.

289
01:54:21,588 --> 01:54:23,021
No, I can,t.

290
01:54:24,691 --> 01:54:27,091
It,s all rightJude. I know what
to do. We,ll talk in the morning.

291
01:54:37,103 --> 01:54:40,004
Write to Arabella.
Ask her to take you back.

292
01:54:55,955 --> 01:54:57,445
No. How can you, Sue?
You love me.

293
01:54:57,557 --> 01:54:59,752
You love me, Sue.

294
01:55:01,194 --> 01:55:02,957
Say it, Sue.

295
01:55:04,764 --> 01:55:08,663
Say it.

296
01:55:08,768 --> 01:55:10,668
Say it. Say it.

297
01:55:22,582 --> 01:55:24,072
Not for me.

298
01:57:05,351 --> 01:57:07,478
How are you?

299
01:57:07,587 --> 01:57:09,054
All right.

300
01:57:10,289 --> 01:57:12,052
You look well.

301
01:57:12,158 --> 01:57:14,592
Do I?

302
01:57:32,712 --> 01:57:35,909
I won't stop trying.
I promised you that.

303
01:57:35,982 --> 01:57:37,506
Jude...

304
01:57:37,583 --> 01:57:38,982
Do you love me?

305
01:57:48,227 --> 01:57:51,025
You,ve always known.

306
01:57:52,331 --> 01:57:55,300
Sue, come with me.

307
01:57:57,303 --> 01:57:58,998
No Jude.
