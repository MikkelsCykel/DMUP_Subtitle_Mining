<i>Fucking Federales, dude.</i>

2
00:00:09,344 --> 00:00:11,403
I got weed on me.
I'll meet you on the other side.

3
00:00:11,513 --> 00:00:13,913
Don't worry, I'll take care of this.

4
00:00:14,015 --> 00:00:15,684
Hold on. Back up here.

5
00:00:17,219 --> 00:00:18,516
Excuse me.

6
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:24,081
Let us into Mexico, please?

7
00:00:29,431 --> 00:00:32,764
Okay, so, thank you!
I guess I checked out, then.

8
00:00:34,169 --> 00:00:36,933
Look at that! I guess our RV is tore up.

9
00:00:37,038 --> 00:00:38,938
Well, guess we'll have to take a plane
the rest of the way.

10
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,268
Oh, well. Come on, let's go.

11
00:00:40,375 --> 00:00:43,105
- Dude, what happened in there, man?
- Nothing. Really cool people.

12
00:00:43,211 --> 00:00:44,508
So, come on, let's book.

13
00:00:44,613 --> 00:00:45,978
What, really?
I mean, everything okay in there?

14
00:00:46,081 --> 00:00:47,480
- 'Cause you look really pale.
- Yeah.

15
00:00:47,582 --> 00:00:50,346
That's because I wear sun block,
you ass. Okay?

16
00:00:50,452 --> 00:00:52,784
So, come on, let's grab that airplane
and get out of here.

17
00:00:56,558 --> 00:00:59,391
- So, what happened in that room?
- Drop it.

18
00:00:59,494 --> 00:01:01,758
- Drop what?
- Okay, look, they...

19
00:01:01,863 --> 00:01:05,026
Oh, come on! I come in peace, brother.
Come on.

20
00:01:05,133 --> 00:01:07,829
You guys, the plane's boarding.
Come on.

21
00:01:07,936 --> 00:01:10,336
Hey guys, I need to tell you something.

22
00:01:10,438 --> 00:01:12,531
What, you're quitting?
Come on, no, it's...

23
00:01:12,641 --> 00:01:15,235
No, no, I'm not quitting.
It's actually the opposite.

24
00:01:15,343 --> 00:01:16,640
I wanted to thank you guys.

25
00:01:16,745 --> 00:01:21,273
I took this job 'cause I needed it,
but I also took it for other reasons.

26
00:01:21,383 --> 00:01:25,012
I figured a trip into the jungle would
be a kind of a forced sobriety for me,

27
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:28,715
and that's something
I really need in my life.

28
00:01:28,823 --> 00:01:31,986
My name's Bill W.
And I'm an alcoholic.

29
00:01:32,093 --> 00:01:33,924
- Hey, Bill.
- Hi, Bill.

30
00:01:34,029 --> 00:01:36,896
Because of that, I've never really fit in
anywhere, you know?

31
00:01:36,998 --> 00:01:41,833
I want to tell you guys.
Couple days ago, I took my last drink.

32
00:01:41,937 --> 00:01:46,533
And then I did yesterday, and, well,
God willing, this'll really be the last one.

33
00:01:46,641 --> 00:01:50,270
'Cause we're going to the jungle and
I got some tough times ahead of me.

34
00:01:50,378 --> 00:01:52,710
But you guys
have been really great to me.

35
00:01:52,814 --> 00:01:56,477
And I just want to say that you've
really made me part of your family

36
00:01:56,584 --> 00:01:58,211
and I wanna say thank you for that.

37
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,787
- That's so sweet.
- Thank you.

38
00:01:59,888 --> 00:02:04,689
Whitaker, that is some of the finest
words I've ever heard in my life.

39
00:02:04,793 --> 00:02:07,990
And just hearing them makes me feel
like I'm a better person.

40
00:02:08,096 --> 00:02:10,963
So, fuck it, man. Take a bow.

41
00:02:14,135 --> 00:02:18,834
He was like, "I'm an alcoholic."
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

42
00:02:53,375 --> 00:02:54,535
<i>Strange Wilderness?</i>

43
00:02:54,642 --> 00:02:58,305
That's us.
I'm Pete, and this is the rest of them.

44
00:02:59,914 --> 00:03:01,381
Hi, I'm Cheryl.

45
00:03:01,483 --> 00:03:03,781
- It is so nice to meet you.
- Good to meet you.

46
00:03:03,885 --> 00:03:07,048
Yeah, Bill told me
what Pierson did to his wife.

47
00:03:07,155 --> 00:03:09,487
Bill's a good man.
Shouldn't have happened to him.

48
00:03:09,591 --> 00:03:12,560
He's upset. That's why he asked me
to get you to Gus Hayden.

49
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:15,128
- That's great. Great.
- Now for the bad news.

50
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:16,720
Pierson's got about
a three-day jump on you.

51
00:03:16,831 --> 00:03:18,662
- Oh, no.
- But, hey, don't worry about it.

52
00:03:18,767 --> 00:03:19,825
We'll find him.

53
00:03:19,934 --> 00:03:21,094
Tell you what, we'll go up to Gus's

54
00:03:21,202 --> 00:03:23,796
and we'll head out from there
and make up for lost time.

55
00:03:23,905 --> 00:03:26,100
- All right.
- By the way, my name's Dick.

56
00:03:26,207 --> 00:03:27,572
Dick what?

57
00:03:29,377 --> 00:03:30,844
Just Dick.

58
00:03:30,945 --> 00:03:32,105
Dick?

59
00:03:33,148 --> 00:03:34,274
Dick.

60
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:37,113
Like Cher, but Dick?

61
00:03:38,486 --> 00:03:39,646
Dick.

62
00:03:40,822 --> 00:03:44,349
He's fucking... Who is this?

63
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:46,620
Dick, Dick, Dick, Dick, Dick.

64
00:03:51,099 --> 00:03:52,566
Gotta have more name than that, Dick.

65
00:03:52,667 --> 00:03:56,068
Nope. Just Dick.

66
00:03:56,171 --> 00:03:58,662
You say, "Dick," I come running.

67
00:04:01,342 --> 00:04:03,367
You come where?

68
00:04:03,478 --> 00:04:07,005
You like your name? You like Dick?

69
00:04:07,115 --> 00:04:09,948
Do you ever let your dog
lick your name?

70
00:04:10,051 --> 00:04:11,450
Yeah, do you like it?

71
00:04:11,553 --> 00:04:13,248
Is your name Dick?

72
00:04:14,856 --> 00:04:17,757
I don't wanna get started off
on the wrong foot with you guys.

73
00:04:17,859 --> 00:04:20,726
Does your name ever shrink
if you go in cold water?

74
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:23,764
Snicker one more time, I'll kick
your balls up in your fucking neck.

75
00:04:23,865 --> 00:04:25,196
- Check.
- 10-4.

76
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,460
Copy that.

77
00:04:26,568 --> 00:04:30,265
Our trail's about 23 clicks west of here.

78
00:04:30,371 --> 00:04:31,395
Right.

79
00:04:31,506 --> 00:04:32,996
Does your name ever get hard
in the morning?

80
00:04:33,108 --> 00:04:34,336
Shut the fuck up.

81
00:04:42,217 --> 00:04:45,380
<i>On our way to hook up
with legendary tracker, Gus Hayden,</i>

82
00:04:45,487 --> 00:04:50,015
<i>we encountered many jungle animals,
including our furry relative,</i>

83
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:51,854
<i>the monkey.</i>

84
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:55,896
<i>Monkeys make up over 80%
of the world's monkey population.</i>

85
00:04:57,165 --> 00:05:00,293
<i>Hundreds of ants are eaten each year
by monkeys.</i>

86
00:05:00,401 --> 00:05:03,700
<i>Researchers believe
that these numbers would be far less,</i>

87
00:05:03,805 --> 00:05:07,206
<i>if ants were the same size
or bigger than monkeys.</i>

88
00:05:07,308 --> 00:05:10,937
<i>Wow, look at that.
Those balls are sensational.</i>

89
00:05:11,045 --> 00:05:14,708
<i>To a lion,
these balls are called a "sack lunch."</i>

90
00:05:14,816 --> 00:05:18,377
<i>Over here,
we spot some South American gazelles.</i>

91
00:05:18,486 --> 00:05:21,148
<i>This gazelle is eating a flower.</i>

92
00:05:21,256 --> 00:05:23,918
<i>This lion is eating the gazelle.</i>

93
00:05:24,025 --> 00:05:27,188
<i>But he'll probably spit out the flower.</i>

94
00:05:27,295 --> 00:05:29,627
<i>These giraffes can't quit each other.</i>

95
00:05:29,731 --> 00:05:33,895
<i>I think it would be a good idea to tie
your brand new jeans to their heads.</i>

96
00:05:34,002 --> 00:05:37,904
<i>That way, your jeans
would get that distressed look.</i>

97
00:05:38,006 --> 00:05:41,203
<i>These birds are saying howdy
to the zebra.</i>

98
00:05:41,309 --> 00:05:44,938
<i>Actually, they're not saying howdy,
they're eating the shit out of him.</i>

99
00:05:45,046 --> 00:05:47,981
<i>If we held a microphone up to the zebra
and he could talk like,</i>

100
00:05:48,082 --> 00:05:52,280
<i>you know, Mr. Ed or something, it would
probably sound something like this,</i>

101
00:05:52,387 --> 00:05:56,346
<i>"Oh, my God. Oh, my God! Oh, my God!</i>

102
00:05:56,457 --> 00:05:59,358
<i>"Did one of you just
shove your beak up my ass?"</i>

103
00:06:06,334 --> 00:06:08,325
All right. We'll walk from here.

104
00:06:09,304 --> 00:06:12,102
All right, let's go, chop-chop.
It's about three clicks that way.

105
00:06:12,207 --> 00:06:14,539
Stay on the trail. Follow me. Let's go.

106
00:06:15,443 --> 00:06:16,740
Let's go!

107
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:44,130
All right. You're about to meet the
world's greatest tracker, Gus Hayden.

108
00:06:53,181 --> 00:06:55,581
Welcome to paradise.

109
00:06:55,683 --> 00:06:58,208
I hear we're gonna have a little fun.

110
00:06:59,621 --> 00:07:04,183
I shoved my knife through
the top of his skull into his brain.

111
00:07:04,292 --> 00:07:08,854
Then I grabbed my hand grenade,
pushed that into his head hole.

112
00:07:08,963 --> 00:07:12,763
And I shoved him back down into the
tunnel and ran like hell.

113
00:07:13,534 --> 00:07:14,865
Hey, Gus.

114
00:07:14,969 --> 00:07:16,527
That was a great Vietnam story.

115
00:07:16,638 --> 00:07:19,607
But I think...
You wanna let go of Fred there?

116
00:07:19,707 --> 00:07:22,437
I think you're close to killing him.

117
00:07:22,543 --> 00:07:25,376
Sorry, I forgot about you there, partner.

118
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,879
Anyway, the little gook bit me,

119
00:07:26,981 --> 00:07:30,348
and that's how I got this scar
right here on this thumb.

120
00:07:30,451 --> 00:07:31,475
Cool.

121
00:07:31,586 --> 00:07:33,850
So, Gus, tell us,
what are we in store for tomorrow?

122
00:07:33,955 --> 00:07:35,855
We'll break camp at 0600.

123
00:07:35,957 --> 00:07:39,916
I want you all to understand that when
we head into the Coconga Wilderness,

124
00:07:40,028 --> 00:07:43,395
we'll be going into a bad, dark place

125
00:07:43,498 --> 00:07:46,228
where death is about as routine
as a change of pants.

126
00:07:46,334 --> 00:07:48,928
Well, this crew here?

127
00:07:49,037 --> 00:07:51,835
We've been through some
pretty hairy adventures of our own.

128
00:07:51,939 --> 00:07:54,499
And I know you got that little scar
there on your thumb,

129
00:07:54,609 --> 00:07:58,443
but we've gotten a few scars
over the years ourselves.

130
00:07:58,546 --> 00:08:00,343
- Isn't that right, Fred?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

131
00:08:00,448 --> 00:08:02,439
I mean, look at this one.

132
00:08:04,585 --> 00:08:06,780
Eight years old. Fell off my bike.

133
00:08:06,888 --> 00:08:07,946
Shit.

134
00:08:08,056 --> 00:08:10,820
Check out this guy. See that?

135
00:08:10,925 --> 00:08:15,021
I was doing some Bondo work
on a '67 Pontiac Sky Chief

136
00:08:15,129 --> 00:08:20,226
and I was drunk, as usual,
and caught this on the hood ornament.

137
00:08:23,104 --> 00:08:24,298
Nasty.

138
00:08:24,906 --> 00:08:27,636
But... Hey, two days sober today, guys.

139
00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:30,712
Thank you. Thank you very much.

140
00:08:30,712 --> 00:08:31,269
Thank you. Thank you very much.

141
00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:36,783
Well, I don't have any scars,
but I have this really great birthmark.

142
00:08:38,853 --> 00:08:40,115
See?

143
00:08:42,757 --> 00:08:46,249
You see this right here?
Dog bit me when I was a kid.

144
00:08:46,361 --> 00:08:48,022
I was blowing in his face,
and he nipped...

145
00:08:48,129 --> 00:08:51,428
Well, now.
You're talking scars, I got one for you.

146
00:08:51,532 --> 00:08:52,863
About 10 years ago

147
00:08:52,967 --> 00:08:56,425
I was scouting out a location
for a mining company in the Amazon,

148
00:08:56,537 --> 00:09:00,735
when I was ambushed
by a tribe of Aloha pygmies.

149
00:09:00,842 --> 00:09:04,972
They tied me to a post and did to me
what they do to all white men.

150
00:09:13,121 --> 00:09:17,080
They cut my scrotum with a sharp stick.
Then they ran away.

151
00:09:17,191 --> 00:09:20,649
My testicles unraveled down
to the ground.

152
00:09:20,762 --> 00:09:23,754
I scooped up my testicles
from out of the dirt, rolled them up,

153
00:09:23,865 --> 00:09:27,596
shoved them back into my sac,
and then sewed it shut myself.

154
00:09:33,941 --> 00:09:37,502
Looks like a quilt. A ball quilt.

155
00:09:39,614 --> 00:09:41,479
Okay, well...

156
00:09:41,582 --> 00:09:46,315
I'd love to sit here
and swap some more scar stories,

157
00:09:46,421 --> 00:09:48,218
but I'm all out.

158
00:09:48,322 --> 00:09:50,222
I'm tired.

159
00:09:50,324 --> 00:09:51,916
Yeah, you know what? Yeah, yeah.

160
00:09:52,026 --> 00:09:53,687
I'm gonna saw some logs, myself.

161
00:09:53,795 --> 00:09:55,695
- Yeah.
- All right. All right.

162
00:09:55,797 --> 00:09:58,595
Must have the worst nightmares ever.

163
00:10:09,644 --> 00:10:10,838
Pete.

164
00:10:11,846 --> 00:10:13,404
- Hey!
- What?

165
00:10:13,514 --> 00:10:16,915
Dude, that tracker guy left,
and Cheryl ran off with him.

166
00:10:17,018 --> 00:10:19,612
Cheryl? Cheryl!

167
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,449
What? She ran off with Gus Hayden?

168
00:10:21,556 --> 00:10:24,252
She's gone, he's gone,
and all our shit's gone!

169
00:10:24,358 --> 00:10:27,919
- Hey, you're probably in on it!
- No!

170
00:10:28,029 --> 00:10:30,156
He left me just as stranded as you all.

171
00:10:30,264 --> 00:10:32,698
He took my bunker jeep.
We got nothing!

172
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,463
- Shit! Why would Cheryl do this to us?
- No, no, no.

173
00:10:36,571 --> 00:10:40,029
I saw her eyeing that fucking psycho
across the campfire last night.

174
00:10:40,141 --> 00:10:43,042
Shit! Shit! God!

175
00:10:44,312 --> 00:10:46,610
Shit! Shit!

176
00:10:47,982 --> 00:10:49,210
God!

177
00:10:49,317 --> 00:10:52,650
All right, calm down!
Everybody, just pull yourself together!

178
00:10:54,222 --> 00:10:58,386
Bill, I need you to take an inventory
of everything that's left, okay? Go, now.

179
00:10:58,493 --> 00:11:02,054
Okay. We got one sleeping bag,

180
00:11:02,163 --> 00:11:03,562
so I think we're pretty much fucked.

181
00:11:03,664 --> 00:11:08,294
No, I think we're gonna be okay.
I think we're great. Let's go find Bigfoot.

182
00:11:08,402 --> 00:11:10,836
What aren't you hearing?
He took the map!

183
00:11:10,938 --> 00:11:12,496
We can't find Bigfoot without a map!

184
00:11:12,607 --> 00:11:15,633
Yeah, but we can't give up, okay?
We can't!

185
00:11:15,743 --> 00:11:18,940
'Cause my dad wouldn't give up.
You know that. You knew him.

186
00:11:19,046 --> 00:11:23,039
I mean, he'd always make it work out.
And I'm just like my dad!

187
00:11:23,985 --> 00:11:27,978
All right. Okay.
I'll lead you through the jungle.

188
00:11:28,089 --> 00:11:31,081
I'm going as far as Temescal,
but after that, you're on your own.

189
00:11:31,192 --> 00:11:34,423
- Okay.
- That jungle is thick.

190
00:11:34,529 --> 00:11:37,794
I don't think anybody's
ever even been in there.

191
00:11:37,899 --> 00:11:42,131
You know, you should quit now,
while you're alive.

192
00:11:42,236 --> 00:11:44,568
Nope. Not on my watch.

193
00:11:44,672 --> 00:11:45,730
Guys?

194
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,034
I don't wanna die.

195
00:11:47,141 --> 00:11:50,167
For the first time in 11 years,
I'm seeing the world through sober eyes

196
00:11:50,278 --> 00:11:52,872
and it's exhilarating.

197
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,914
See, I have so much to live for
right now.

198
00:11:55,016 --> 00:11:58,508
I want to find a nice girl
and settle down and have kids

199
00:11:58,619 --> 00:12:01,281
and dance with them in the moonlight
and everything.

200
00:12:01,389 --> 00:12:03,687
I want to do it all, you know?

201
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:06,282
Fucking beautiful. Take a bow, man.

202
00:12:07,795 --> 00:12:13,256
He was like, "I'm wearing a blue shirt
and I'm sad in my heart."

203
00:12:13,367 --> 00:12:14,994
I didn't think you were gonna do that!

204
00:12:15,102 --> 00:12:17,730
Okay! Cooker, you need to...

205
00:12:20,508 --> 00:12:22,339
Is that a thong you're wearing?

206
00:12:22,443 --> 00:12:24,707
What the fuck did you say?

207
00:12:24,812 --> 00:12:26,677
Do you have a thong on?

208
00:12:27,648 --> 00:12:29,707
Yeah, I'm wearing a thong.

209
00:12:31,085 --> 00:12:32,450
I'll get the sleeping bag.

210
00:12:44,198 --> 00:12:46,223
Dick, there any snakes in this shit,
or what?

211
00:12:46,334 --> 00:12:48,894
Don't worry about fucking snakes.

212
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:53,766
Fuck you, dude.

213
00:12:55,276 --> 00:12:57,335
Shit, a porcupine.

214
00:13:13,628 --> 00:13:15,459
Hey. Hey!

215
00:13:15,563 --> 00:13:20,364
I think it stopped. I think it stopped.

216
00:13:20,468 --> 00:13:23,437
- Oh, God. This is insane.
- All right.

217
00:13:23,537 --> 00:13:27,303
No. It's gonna be okay, I think.
It's gonna be okay.

218
00:13:27,408 --> 00:13:31,105
Come on, let's just keep moving.
It'll be okay.

219
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:39,012
- What the fuck was that?
- Just keep going. It's gonna be fine.

220
00:13:47,895 --> 00:13:49,385
- Come on.
- Hey, come on!

221
00:13:49,497 --> 00:13:51,829
Guys, guys, guys, just a monkey.
It's just a monkey.

222
00:13:51,932 --> 00:13:53,126
Jesus.

223
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:01,404
- You guys!
- Oh, shit!

224
00:14:01,509 --> 00:14:05,775
I have been tracking you for hours.
Why did you leave me back there?

225
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:09,008
Well, we thought you ran off
with Gus Hayden.

226
00:14:10,618 --> 00:14:12,848
You really think I'd do that?

227
00:14:12,953 --> 00:14:14,079
Yeah.

228
00:14:14,188 --> 00:14:15,212
Gross.

229
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:19,856
I'd wanna fuck even you guys
before I'd wanna fuck him.

230
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,621
- Hey.
- All right.

231
00:14:21,729 --> 00:14:23,822
You guys, I woke up
and he was stealing all our stuff,

232
00:14:23,931 --> 00:14:26,729
so I pretended like
I wanted to go with him

233
00:14:28,202 --> 00:14:32,195
and I convinced him to give me this.

234
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:34,940
The map.

235
00:14:35,042 --> 00:14:37,101
You convinced him?

236
00:14:38,946 --> 00:14:41,380
What'd you have to do?

237
00:14:41,482 --> 00:14:43,973
Just a little something. Okay?

238
00:14:44,085 --> 00:14:46,280
I took one for the team.

239
00:14:48,022 --> 00:14:50,889
I have a map.

240
00:14:50,991 --> 00:14:53,789
- Me, too. I got a map.
- I got a bunch of maps.

241
00:14:53,894 --> 00:14:55,020
I have an atlas.

242
00:14:55,129 --> 00:15:00,066
I have some old Civil War maps
that are worth quite a bit.

243
00:15:00,167 --> 00:15:03,159
I have a map of the moon.
It's like... You can feel it.

244
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:06,000
I got a whole map store.
Maps everywhere.

245
00:15:06,107 --> 00:15:07,972
If we get back to the RV,
I got a Thomas Guide.

246
00:15:08,075 --> 00:15:10,475
Like a hundred pages of maps.

247
00:15:10,578 --> 00:15:13,069
Come here, you guys!

248
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:15,910
Just kidding. I don't have a map.

249
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:20,946
I'll tell you, I will be damned.
I will just be damned.

250
00:15:21,055 --> 00:15:25,617
You know, with that map
and my jungle survival skills,

251
00:15:25,726 --> 00:15:28,320
just might be able
to help you find Bigfoot after all.

252
00:15:28,429 --> 00:15:29,589
Yeah!

253
00:15:29,697 --> 00:15:31,665
Dick! Dick! Dick!

254
00:15:34,135 --> 00:15:35,432
- We love Dick!
- Yes, we are.

255
00:15:35,536 --> 00:15:39,836
Yes, we are. First, though,
we gotta cross the Mohate River.

256
00:15:52,086 --> 00:15:53,781
We're almost there.

257
00:15:53,888 --> 00:15:56,721
Just straight that way.
Okay, you're doing great, Fred.

258
00:15:56,824 --> 00:15:59,292
- Thank you, thank you.
- You're doing great.

259
00:16:01,061 --> 00:16:04,792
- Cooker, I'm proud of you.
- Hey, Dick. I'm proud of you in turn.

260
00:16:04,899 --> 00:16:07,060
You're the best. You're the best.

261
00:16:07,868 --> 00:16:10,837
Now, I know a secret quick way through
this jungle,

262
00:16:10,938 --> 00:16:13,839
and we can get to the rocky cliffs
and maybe cut off Pierson.

263
00:16:13,941 --> 00:16:16,341
Now, here's what you're gonna do.

264
00:16:17,278 --> 00:16:19,041
What the... Oh, God!

265
00:16:23,317 --> 00:16:26,252
Don't come in here! No! Stay out!

266
00:16:28,455 --> 00:16:30,719
Oh, Dick!

267
00:16:30,825 --> 00:16:33,327
Here's another one
of those piranha bastards.

268
00:16:33,494 --> 00:16:35,894
Fucking eat all these fucking stupid fish.

269
00:16:35,996 --> 00:16:39,932
We were gonna make it,
and then these bastards ate Dick!

270
00:16:40,034 --> 00:16:42,696
- How's it feel to get eaten, fish fuckers?
- Yeah!

271
00:16:42,803 --> 00:16:45,829
- How's it feel to get eaten?
- Stupid... Stupid fish!

272
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:49,740
You think we'd just let you get away
with eating Dick,

273
00:16:49,844 --> 00:16:52,745
you sons-of-bitches,
pieces of river trash!

274
00:16:52,847 --> 00:16:54,781
Fuck you! Fuck you!

275
00:16:56,016 --> 00:16:57,449
Hey, wait a minute.

276
00:16:59,153 --> 00:17:01,246
These are the fish that ate Dick, right?

277
00:17:01,355 --> 00:17:03,255
Yeah!

278
00:17:03,357 --> 00:17:05,257
All right, just go with me here.

279
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:10,126
If Dick is in the fishes,
and we're eating the fishes,

280
00:17:10,231 --> 00:17:12,791
doesn't that mean we're eating Dick?

281
00:17:17,705 --> 00:17:19,195
What the fuck?

282
00:17:25,946 --> 00:17:28,881
- It's gonna be okay! Come on! Fred.
- No!

283
00:17:29,016 --> 00:17:31,678
Not one single thing has gone our way!

284
00:17:31,785 --> 00:17:35,744
And I guarantee you
Pierson found Bigfoot's cave days ago.

285
00:17:35,856 --> 00:17:38,450
Come on, Fred!
Don't be so negative, okay?

286
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:42,017
Come on...
Our luck is gonna change, I can feel it.

287
00:17:42,129 --> 00:17:43,824
Oh, my God.

288
00:17:43,931 --> 00:17:47,492
You guys have to come with me.
I think I found something.

289
00:17:57,111 --> 00:18:01,070
- It's Pierson's team.
- Holy crap.

290
00:18:01,181 --> 00:18:03,149
Fred. Get over here, Fred.

291
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:08,119
Mr. Wah I'm So Bummed Out.
Pierson's Gonna Find Bigfoot First...

292
00:18:08,222 --> 00:18:11,282
I don't think so, buddy!
Looks like our luck is changing.

293
00:18:11,392 --> 00:18:13,952
We came out on top! Come on!

294
00:18:18,365 --> 00:18:22,131
Oh, yeah. Oh, right. This is tragic.

295
00:18:25,005 --> 00:18:28,771
Amen. Okay,
let's gather up their equipment, guys.

296
00:18:30,077 --> 00:18:31,601
Sweet axe.

297
00:18:35,549 --> 00:18:40,851
<i>Gentle clouds of Nazareth</i>

298
00:18:40,955 --> 00:18:44,857
<i>Massacred in Ecuador</i>

299
00:18:44,959 --> 00:18:49,726
<i>Life's too fucking short
Ask that guy</i>

300
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:52,856
Hey, that's Sky Pierson.

301
00:18:52,967 --> 00:18:55,231
- Oh, my God!
- Gaulke.

302
00:18:55,336 --> 00:18:56,735
- Hey.
- Gaulke.

303
00:18:56,837 --> 00:18:59,965
Hi, Sky. Wow, long time no see.

304
00:19:00,841 --> 00:19:02,035
So...

305
00:19:03,277 --> 00:19:06,713
I'm sorry. Sorry about that.
I just had some bad fish.

306
00:19:06,814 --> 00:19:10,409
So, what happened here?

307
00:19:10,517 --> 00:19:11,814
Attacked.

308
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:15,212
Coconga pygmies.

309
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:18,118
Horrible.

310
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,450
Hey, Sky,

311
00:19:22,596 --> 00:19:24,791
could you feel this?

312
00:19:24,898 --> 00:19:26,263
Dude.

313
00:19:26,367 --> 00:19:29,234
What are you poking him for, man?
The guy's dying.

314
00:19:29,336 --> 00:19:34,000
His upper half of his body
is not connected to his lower half.

315
00:19:34,108 --> 00:19:37,373
- Yeah, I know. Jesus Christ. What?
- Hey, Pete, Pete.

316
00:19:37,478 --> 00:19:40,879
You gonna punch him in the face
like Bill asked?

317
00:19:40,981 --> 00:19:44,007
Oh, shit. Forgot about that.

318
00:19:47,354 --> 00:19:49,288
It's your call.

319
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:53,690
Oh, man. I don't know.
I'm kind of on the fence about it.

320
00:19:53,794 --> 00:19:56,456
It's not like he's in any position
to punch you back.

321
00:19:56,563 --> 00:19:58,724
Fred, it has nothing to do with fear.

322
00:19:58,832 --> 00:20:01,460
I mean, don't you think it's a little
excessive, punching him in the face?

323
00:20:01,568 --> 00:20:04,036
He's missing the lower half of his body.

324
00:20:04,138 --> 00:20:05,332
Gaulke.

325
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:10,537
- Hey, we're back.
- Gaulke, you still here?

326
00:20:10,644 --> 00:20:12,111
Yeah, we're here.

327
00:20:14,181 --> 00:20:16,376
Hey, the cavalry has arrived.

328
00:20:20,454 --> 00:20:21,716
Sky.

329
00:20:25,926 --> 00:20:27,223
Oh, Sky.

330
00:20:29,096 --> 00:20:30,290
Let's go.

331
00:20:30,397 --> 00:20:32,763
Pick up what you can carry,
especially the camera equipment.

332
00:20:32,866 --> 00:20:34,629
Let's get the hell out of here.

333
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:14,399
See, I could've sworn
these are the markings!

334
00:21:14,508 --> 00:21:15,839
They're right there on the map.

335
00:21:15,943 --> 00:21:19,606
Well, then, where the hell is the cave?
It says it's on the map, but it's not there!

336
00:21:19,713 --> 00:21:21,112
Hey, does anyone else
get the feeling that,

337
00:21:21,215 --> 00:21:23,376
like, we've been going in circles
for a while?

338
00:21:23,484 --> 00:21:27,978
Shit! Shit! Shit! Fucking shit!

339
00:21:29,223 --> 00:21:30,190
Shit!

340
00:21:32,726 --> 00:21:34,853
Fuck! Such a fuck up!

341
00:21:37,164 --> 00:21:40,099
Give me that fucking map!

342
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,497
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

343
00:21:41,602 --> 00:21:45,732
You said that Bill Calhoun
took a real picture of the map, right?

344
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:48,034
Yeah, Pierson was holding it
in his hands.

345
00:21:48,142 --> 00:21:50,940
Okay. Bill was using
two security cameras.

346
00:21:51,044 --> 00:21:55,538
It's a mirror image. Look at the "N".
The map got printed out backwards.

347
00:21:55,649 --> 00:21:57,241
Flip the picture.

348
00:21:58,819 --> 00:22:01,253
Cheryl, you are a genius!

349
00:22:02,356 --> 00:22:04,824
Okay, so wait.
So all the directions are reversed.

350
00:22:04,925 --> 00:22:08,861
So then that means
that the cave is not here.

351
00:22:08,962 --> 00:22:12,261
It's gonna be over, around here.
Come on, let's go!

352
00:22:22,176 --> 00:22:23,666
That's it.

353
00:22:23,777 --> 00:22:25,870
That's the cave. It's gotta be. Map.

354
00:22:25,979 --> 00:22:28,447
See? Turn the map.

355
00:22:28,549 --> 00:22:32,747
Rock formation fits with the hill.
That cave is his cave.

356
00:22:47,668 --> 00:22:49,863
How do we know he's in there?

357
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:52,404
I can feel him. Okay, come on.

358
00:22:52,506 --> 00:22:56,340
We're gonna move closer,
but stealthily, like that of a cheetah.

359
00:23:09,756 --> 00:23:13,988
Oh, my God, I can hear him.
He's in there. Holy God. Okay.

360
00:23:14,094 --> 00:23:18,428
This is probably the most important
wildlife discovery of our time,

361
00:23:18,532 --> 00:23:20,796
and we're gonna chronicle it.

362
00:23:22,603 --> 00:23:23,763
Okay.

363
00:23:24,805 --> 00:23:27,171
Okay, over there. Cross, cross.

364
00:23:28,408 --> 00:23:29,705
This is crazy.

365
00:23:30,043 --> 00:23:31,738
Okay, set up the camera.

366
00:23:31,845 --> 00:23:34,712
Okay, listen up.
Here's what's gonna happen.

367
00:23:34,815 --> 00:23:37,249
I'm gonna do an intro throw announce,

368
00:23:37,351 --> 00:23:39,410
and then we're gonna
slowly steal inside

369
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:42,079
and catch this amazing creature
in his natural habitat, okay?

370
00:23:42,189 --> 00:23:43,588
Okay, ready?

371
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:47,319
Oh, remember. Okay, listen. Junior!

372
00:23:47,427 --> 00:23:48,758
- Listen.
- I am.

373
00:23:48,862 --> 00:23:51,490
Do not spook him, okay?

374
00:23:51,598 --> 00:23:55,090
He is probably very,
very frightened of us.

375
00:23:55,202 --> 00:23:57,693
- Okay.
- Okay.

376
00:23:57,804 --> 00:23:59,328
I got sound if you wanna go.

377
00:23:59,439 --> 00:24:00,804
Ready, rolling.

378
00:24:00,907 --> 00:24:05,241
And five, four, three, two, one, zero.
Talking now.

379
00:24:06,513 --> 00:24:10,745
<i>Hi. I'm Peter Gaulke,
and this is Strange Wilderness.</i>

380
00:24:10,851 --> 00:24:16,448
Camped here, waiting to film Bigfoot.

381
00:24:16,556 --> 00:24:18,854
That's right, you heard me, Bigfoot.

382
00:24:18,959 --> 00:24:22,224
Animals have long been known
as animals, not human,

383
00:24:22,329 --> 00:24:28,757
and have been described as stupid,
cowardly, aggressive, dimwitted,

384
00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:36,133
low beasts, eager to kill, eager to eat,
eager to fornicate,

385
00:24:36,243 --> 00:24:40,509
eager to stampede all...

386
00:24:40,614 --> 00:24:44,277
But is it animals we describe,
or is it mankind?

387
00:24:46,053 --> 00:24:50,490
Perhaps this Bigfoot creature can
bridge the divide between us and them.

388
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:54,082
Perhaps his gentle ways can teach us,
remind us

389
00:24:54,194 --> 00:24:59,860
that peace and harmony
are necessary if mankind is to survive.

390
00:24:59,966 --> 00:25:01,524
What?

391
00:25:01,635 --> 00:25:02,897
Oh, fuck!

392
00:25:29,563 --> 00:25:30,530
Hey...

393
00:25:31,498 --> 00:25:36,128
Does anybody remember what that
big bastard said before he came at us?

394
00:25:39,306 --> 00:25:45,142
I think he said, "Huh?"
Like he wasn't sure what was going on.

395
00:25:45,245 --> 00:25:48,578
- No. It was more of a growl.
- Yeah, totally.

396
00:25:48,682 --> 00:25:51,207
Actually, you know what?
It was more like a death growl.

397
00:25:51,318 --> 00:25:55,755
It was like, "I'm gonna kill you."
I mean, I heard that.

398
00:25:55,856 --> 00:25:57,721
- Yeah, no, I did, too. Yeah.
- Yeah.

399
00:25:57,824 --> 00:25:59,451
I heard it, too.

400
00:26:00,694 --> 00:26:03,754
- Didn't I?
- Yeah. No. Oh, yeah.

401
00:26:03,864 --> 00:26:05,491
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- That's what he said, man.

402
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:09,091
I've just, you know,
I've just never killed anything before.

403
00:26:09,202 --> 00:26:10,794
But it was in self-defense, so...

404
00:26:10,904 --> 00:26:12,496
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah. The lady's right.

405
00:26:12,606 --> 00:26:17,407
This mythological beast
was engineered by the French.

406
00:26:17,511 --> 00:26:21,174
Fuck, I was so blind to not see it before.

407
00:26:21,281 --> 00:26:24,512
It was designed by the French
in the early '50s

408
00:26:24,618 --> 00:26:29,078
to fuck and eventually
kill American people.

409
00:26:29,189 --> 00:26:34,024
He would've come
and fucking killed all of us.

410
00:26:34,127 --> 00:26:35,185
You know what?

411
00:26:35,295 --> 00:26:37,593
Like, if a mosquito is buzzing
around your ear, do you let it go?

412
00:26:37,697 --> 00:26:40,359
Like, "Keep on bothering me
and, like, sting me

413
00:26:40,467 --> 00:26:41,661
"and let me get West Nile Virus?"

414
00:26:41,768 --> 00:26:44,828
No, you fucking smack it, like we did.

415
00:26:44,938 --> 00:26:47,065
Only we did it with guns.

416
00:26:47,174 --> 00:26:49,301
- I don't know, guys. I mean...
- What?

417
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:51,807
Well, I mean...

418
00:26:53,547 --> 00:26:55,071
- Fuck him, right?
- Yeah.

419
00:26:55,182 --> 00:26:59,141
That prick deserved to die, right?
Big, hairy, carnivore son-of-a-bitch.

420
00:26:59,252 --> 00:27:02,619
You see the way he came at us,
all up in our face and all...

421
00:27:02,722 --> 00:27:04,553
Fucking fuck you, you fuck.

422
00:27:04,658 --> 00:27:06,216
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

423
00:27:09,296 --> 00:27:11,059
Fucking cocktease.

424
00:27:16,369 --> 00:27:20,237
But, you know, I've been thinking.

425
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:24,902
Maybe it's not the best way
to end our show, though?

426
00:27:25,011 --> 00:27:28,879
You know, actually killing Bigfoot?

427
00:27:29,483 --> 00:27:30,507
Yeah.

428
00:27:30,617 --> 00:27:33,484
Probably not gonna fly
with the TV station.

429
00:27:35,422 --> 00:27:38,448
Peter, I have a little idea.

430
00:27:49,169 --> 00:27:51,194
Those sharks
ate the living shit out of me,

431
00:27:51,304 --> 00:27:54,671
like my leg was a fucking piece of corn
on the cob with butter on it.

432
00:27:54,774 --> 00:27:56,867
I was yelling at them
that I wasn't no seal.

433
00:27:56,977 --> 00:27:58,410
"Hey, it's me, Danny-boy!"

434
00:27:58,512 --> 00:28:00,810
But they didn't understand
my human language.

435
00:28:00,914 --> 00:28:02,609
So I got this fake leg now.

436
00:28:02,716 --> 00:28:05,207
The doc comes in my room,
and he asks me what kind I want.

437
00:28:05,318 --> 00:28:06,410
What the fuck?

438
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,784
It turns out he's talking about
the wood or some shit.

439
00:28:08,889 --> 00:28:11,050
Mahogany, pine, or balsa?

440
00:28:11,157 --> 00:28:14,422
So, that gets me thinking,
"I should put a jackhammer on there,

441
00:28:14,528 --> 00:28:18,760
"so when I walk up the sidewalk
I could bust up the cement."

442
00:28:18,865 --> 00:28:21,129
Okay. All right, listen up, everybody.

443
00:28:21,234 --> 00:28:25,193
We're gonna have him eating out
of our hands when he sees this. This.

444
00:28:25,305 --> 00:28:27,637
The television show of the century, huh?

445
00:28:27,741 --> 00:28:28,969
Yeah.

446
00:28:29,075 --> 00:28:30,303
- Bring it.
- Let's do it.

447
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:31,707
- High five!
- Good luck.

448
00:28:32,846 --> 00:28:36,441
<i>We were all shivering with excitement
as we carefully moved in</i>

449
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:40,987
<i>for the first ever contact
with the legendary Bigfoot.</i>

450
00:28:41,087 --> 00:28:43,954
<i>What we found inside the cave
shocked us all.</i>

451
00:28:44,057 --> 00:28:47,458
<i>Apparently, the Bigfoot
had been experiencing depression</i>

452
00:28:47,561 --> 00:28:48,994
<i>and hung himself.</i>

453
00:28:49,095 --> 00:28:52,292
<i>Forced to live like an animal
in a cold dark cave,</i>

454
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:55,732
<i>I imagine any one of us
would've done the same thing.</i>

455
00:28:55,835 --> 00:28:58,235
<i>Unlike that dude on fire
at the peace rally,</i>

456
00:28:58,338 --> 00:29:01,239
<i>we sprung into action
to revive the Bigfoot.</i>

457
00:29:01,341 --> 00:29:03,002
<i>But it was too late.</i>

458
00:29:03,109 --> 00:29:05,976
<i>It made me feel so crappy.</i>

459
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:10,573
<i>And so ended our fantastic adventure,
"The Search for Bigfoot."</i>

460
00:29:10,684 --> 00:29:13,551
<i>Join us next week
for a show about beavers.</i>

461
00:29:14,821 --> 00:29:16,618
Are you insane?

462
00:29:16,723 --> 00:29:19,123
Did someone drop a safe on your head?

463
00:29:19,225 --> 00:29:21,693
That's the craziest shit I've ever seen!

464
00:29:21,795 --> 00:29:24,127
- Hey, quit shoving me, man!
- Yeah, what's that?

465
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:26,391
Man, you've been a dick since day one!

466
00:29:26,499 --> 00:29:29,400
- Yeah? Fuck you!
- Get out, assholes!

467
00:29:29,502 --> 00:29:30,935
- Fuck you, Judy.
- Yeah.

468
00:29:31,037 --> 00:29:32,800
You know what? This is all because of
you and your stupid idea

469
00:29:32,906 --> 00:29:35,067
about faking Bigfoot's suicide.

470
00:29:35,175 --> 00:29:38,201
You know, I should've never listened...
I should've never hired you!

471
00:29:38,311 --> 00:29:41,337
That's the most un-American thing
I've ever heard in my life.

472
00:29:41,448 --> 00:29:43,006
Excuse me, could you keep it down?

473
00:29:43,116 --> 00:29:46,449
Hey, sweetheart, we're having
a private company meeting here.

474
00:29:46,553 --> 00:29:47,850
So why don't you keep it down, okay?

475
00:29:47,954 --> 00:29:50,286
Hey, hey, we're in the middle
of a fucking conversation,

476
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:51,948
you turn around to hit on some chick.

477
00:29:52,058 --> 00:29:55,289
Hey, why you all up in my waist, man?
You feeling froggy, huh?

478
00:29:55,395 --> 00:29:57,727
- Why don't you take a leap?
- I can't. That's fucked up.

479
00:29:57,831 --> 00:29:59,958
You shouldn't talk to someone like that.

480
00:30:00,066 --> 00:30:03,797
You stone-wasted half-man party punk!
Shut the...

481
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:07,537
Whoa, seriously, man. Come on,
he's pathetic. Take it easy on him.

482
00:30:07,641 --> 00:30:11,634
Fuck you, Cheech.
You suck as a soundman, dude.

483
00:30:11,745 --> 00:30:15,408
You stupid fuck. Go buy some sandals.
Go buy some sandals.

484
00:30:15,515 --> 00:30:18,780
You want to fight? I'll fight your fight.
I haven't fought in 10 years.

485
00:30:18,885 --> 00:30:20,352
I'm fighting tonight.

486
00:30:21,955 --> 00:30:25,083
What you got? What you got?
Let's see. Throw down, bitch.

487
00:30:27,394 --> 00:30:28,622
Throw down, bitch.

488
00:30:28,728 --> 00:30:31,128
Hey, you know what? He's right, Fred!

489
00:30:31,231 --> 00:30:32,721
You suck as a soundman, okay...

490
00:30:32,832 --> 00:30:34,697
All right, that's it. I'm calling security.

491
00:30:34,801 --> 00:30:36,701
Oh, no, honey,
you are not calling security.

492
00:30:36,803 --> 00:30:38,668
- You understand me?
- Hey! Hey!

493
00:30:57,090 --> 00:30:59,888
And that is the whole ridiculous story.

494
00:31:01,961 --> 00:31:06,261
No, I haven't seen anybody in,
like, over a year.

495
00:31:06,366 --> 00:31:08,027
You know, things were said.

496
00:31:08,134 --> 00:31:10,932
I think they're a lot better off
without me around anyway.

497
00:31:11,037 --> 00:31:14,165
I'm such a failure. Oh, shit.

498
00:31:14,274 --> 00:31:16,572
Hey, thanks for listening, okay?

499
00:31:16,676 --> 00:31:19,304
I'll talk to you tomorrow. Great. Bye.

500
00:31:20,747 --> 00:31:22,180
Nobody's home!

501
00:31:26,953 --> 00:31:27,977
Pete.

502
00:31:28,088 --> 00:31:30,886
You know
when you yell out "Nobody's home,"

503
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:33,288
people know you're home
because otherwise

504
00:31:33,393 --> 00:31:36,590
who the hell would be yelling out
"Nobody's home."

505
00:31:39,099 --> 00:31:40,566
Brought out a smile.

506
00:31:42,836 --> 00:31:45,930
Well, you won't return my calls,

507
00:31:46,039 --> 00:31:49,566
so I thought I'd personally
hand-deliver a hello.

508
00:31:49,676 --> 00:31:52,873
No, I just couldn't hold it all together.

509
00:31:53,947 --> 00:31:55,812
You know what I've always been
wanting to tell you,

510
00:31:55,915 --> 00:31:58,281
all the times you have
beaten yourself up...

511
00:31:59,486 --> 00:32:02,978
Times were different then. It was easier.

512
00:32:03,089 --> 00:32:04,420
You know something?

513
00:32:04,524 --> 00:32:06,958
Your old man
could never have survived today.

514
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:09,028
I loved your dad, you know that,

515
00:32:09,129 --> 00:32:12,656
but he didn't have the tenacity
and the heart that you have.

516
00:32:12,766 --> 00:32:15,701
You were born into a wildlife family.

517
00:32:15,802 --> 00:32:20,967
Like your old man used to say,
"All it takes is one good idea."

518
00:32:21,074 --> 00:32:23,599
Yeah, he used to always say that.

519
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:26,474
With one good idea
anything can happen.

520
00:32:26,579 --> 00:32:30,811
- But it's up to you.
- Yeah.

521
00:32:30,917 --> 00:32:32,509
What do you say?

522
00:32:33,987 --> 00:32:36,080
I say, "Let's do it."

523
00:32:36,189 --> 00:32:39,716
- Pete Gaulke's back!
- Yeah. Right.

524
00:32:39,826 --> 00:32:42,852
You know what? Thanks, man.
I mean, I really get...

525
00:32:42,962 --> 00:32:45,328
- Hey, do you mind if I tap a bowl first?
- Go ahead.

526
00:32:45,431 --> 00:32:47,831
You know, because... Where's it?

527
00:32:47,934 --> 00:32:50,368
You know,
I have a bunch of great ideas,

528
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:53,337
and they seem like great ideas
for about 10 minutes,

529
00:32:53,439 --> 00:32:56,567
and then I'm sitting here for a while
and all of a sudden they seem stale.

530
00:32:56,676 --> 00:32:59,907
And then I forget about them,
I don't write them down anymore...

531
00:33:00,013 --> 00:33:04,712
I mean, I think what I need to do is
really kind of...

532
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:14,624
Oh, God. That little guy is gonna think
he's a shark.

533
00:33:14,727 --> 00:33:15,785
Hey, wait a minute.

534
00:33:15,895 --> 00:33:18,090
What a hell of an idea for a show.

535
00:33:18,198 --> 00:33:21,167
A show about sharks, huh?

536
00:33:21,267 --> 00:33:23,258
- One good idea.
- Good idea!

537
00:33:23,369 --> 00:33:25,166
Yeah, buddy!

538
00:33:25,271 --> 00:33:26,238
All right.

539
00:33:28,842 --> 00:33:30,742
<i>Hot Dog Hell, can I help you?</i>

540
00:33:30,844 --> 00:33:35,076
<i>Yeah, I need six hotdogs,
I need six cokes,</i>

541
00:33:35,181 --> 00:33:38,912
<i>and the best damn soundman
in the business.</i>

542
00:33:39,018 --> 00:33:41,554
I need Fred Wolf's ass in this car now.

543
00:33:41,554 --> 00:33:41,781
I need Fred Wolf's ass in this car now.

544
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:44,721
<i>Pete! Holy shit, man. You know what?</i>

545
00:33:44,824 --> 00:33:46,223
<i>I've been going through it in my head.</i>

546
00:33:46,326 --> 00:33:48,453
<i>Fifty different ways
on how to apologize to you</i>

547
00:33:48,561 --> 00:33:50,256
<i>for what I said that day, man.</i>

548
00:33:50,363 --> 00:33:52,888
We're all sorry
about all the stuff we said.

549
00:33:52,999 --> 00:33:55,399
<i>Hey, man, the world keeps turning,
you know?</i>

550
00:33:55,501 --> 00:33:57,992
<i>Hey, dads may die
and you may miss him every day,</i>

551
00:33:58,104 --> 00:33:59,731
<i>but you still have your friends.</i>

552
00:33:59,839 --> 00:34:02,000
<i>That was beautiful, man. Take a bow.</i>

553
00:34:03,443 --> 00:34:04,774
<i>Asshole!</i>

554
00:34:04,878 --> 00:34:07,346
Why are they using such bad language?

555
00:34:07,447 --> 00:34:10,041
<i>Yeah, I called Lawson,
and he was mad at first.</i>

556
00:34:10,149 --> 00:34:14,108
<i>He said, Bigfoot thing
was the craziest thing he ever saw.</i>

557
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:17,519
<i>Well, then he never saw R. Kelly's
Trapped in a Fucking Closet!</i>

558
00:34:17,624 --> 00:34:20,218
<i>But he said
if we could get a shark attack on film,</i>

559
00:34:20,326 --> 00:34:22,123
<i>he'd put us back on the air.</i>

560
00:34:26,366 --> 00:34:28,698
<i>So get in the fucking car and let's go!</i>

561
00:34:32,705 --> 00:34:33,694
Get in there!

562
00:34:42,382 --> 00:34:44,373
Excuse me. I didn't say... Hey, hey, hey!

563
00:34:45,285 --> 00:34:46,980
Hi, Ed, how are you?

564
00:34:47,086 --> 00:34:49,953
We got a shark episode
with a shark attack.

565
00:34:52,725 --> 00:34:56,559
<i>Hi, I'm Peter Gaulke
and this is Strange Wilderness.</i>

566
00:34:56,663 --> 00:35:00,190
<i>The ocean. Many words
have been used to describe it.</i>

567
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:02,734
<i>And now you can add one more.
Dangerous.</i>

568
00:35:02,835 --> 00:35:04,996
<i>Why? The shark.</i>

569
00:35:05,104 --> 00:35:06,901
<i>It was one year ago today,</i>

570
00:35:07,006 --> 00:35:10,464
that Danny was brutally attacked
on this very spot

571
00:35:10,576 --> 00:35:13,067
by one of these killing machines.

572
00:35:14,013 --> 00:35:19,713
In today's show, we'll be taking
a close look at this mysterious creature

573
00:35:19,819 --> 00:35:23,414
that should be named
"the asshole of the sea."

574
00:35:24,023 --> 00:35:25,854
<i>Menacing and terrifying,</i>

575
00:35:25,959 --> 00:35:30,623
<i>the shark has been menacing
and terrifying for over a decade.</i>

576
00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:34,029
<i>Sharks can only be found
in two places on earth,</i>

577
00:35:34,133 --> 00:35:37,398
<i>the Northern
and Southern Hemispheres.</i>

578
00:35:37,503 --> 00:35:42,440
<i>This shark is called a Hammerhead
because his head looks like a hammer.</i>

579
00:35:42,542 --> 00:35:44,908
<i>These sharks
are attacking Nicole Richie.</i>

580
00:35:47,246 --> 00:35:50,215
<i>Yes, the shark is a... What the fuck!</i>

581
00:35:50,316 --> 00:35:53,080
<i>Look at that thing's teeth.</i>

582
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:18,577
Okay, you guys ready?

583
00:36:18,678 --> 00:36:21,374
I've never been more ready
in my fucking life.

584
00:36:21,481 --> 00:36:24,473
It's like that shark was gnawing on me
like a rawhide stick.

585
00:36:24,584 --> 00:36:25,881
- This one's for you, Danny.
- How old are those?

586
00:36:25,985 --> 00:36:27,384
Three weeks old.

587
00:36:29,322 --> 00:36:30,653
For you, Danny.

588
00:36:32,091 --> 00:36:33,752
<i>Oh, my God, it's gonna come up.</i>

589
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:35,259
<i>Give me that shit.</i>

590
00:36:39,766 --> 00:36:42,564
All right, let's do this.
Fred, lower the steak.

591
00:36:42,668 --> 00:36:44,761
All right, come on. Let's do this.

592
00:36:45,772 --> 00:36:47,706
That's him. That's that same fucker.

593
00:36:47,807 --> 00:36:49,468
There's a fin. I see a fin.

594
00:36:49,575 --> 00:36:51,008
- I see it, too.
- Hey, shark!

595
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:54,273
We got something for you,
you fucking asshole!

596
00:36:55,815 --> 00:36:57,248
Oh, my God, he's...

597
00:37:01,454 --> 00:37:03,115
That was awesome.

598
00:37:05,191 --> 00:37:08,558
Fuck you, motherfucker!
How did that shit taste?

599
00:37:13,699 --> 00:37:15,189
<i>That did it.</i>

600
00:37:16,602 --> 00:37:17,796
Pete...

601
00:37:18,871 --> 00:37:21,271
Pete, people love shark attacks.

602
00:37:21,374 --> 00:37:24,277
Besides, Pierson's dead,
so you're back on the air.

603
00:37:24,277 --> 00:37:24,504
Besides, Pierson's dead,
so you're back on the air.

604
00:37:29,415 --> 00:37:31,383
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
