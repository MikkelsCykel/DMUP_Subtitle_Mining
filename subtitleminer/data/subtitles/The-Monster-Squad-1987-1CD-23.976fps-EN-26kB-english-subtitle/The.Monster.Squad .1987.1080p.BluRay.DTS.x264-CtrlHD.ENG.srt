1
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,501
Three minutes.
The girl. Now!

2
00:04:56,478 --> 00:04:58,012
Let's hurry a bit,
shall we?

3
00:04:59,748 --> 00:05:02,549
Come on!

4
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:04,018
Faster, faster!

5
00:05:24,372 --> 00:05:25,439
Read!

6
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,541
Or we're all
gonna die!

7
00:06:01,543 --> 00:06:02,576
No! Come back

8
00:06:41,591 --> 00:06:43,258
<i>Well, well, well.</i>

9
00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:46,094
<i>Are you two
sitting comfortably?</i>

10
00:06:46,095 --> 00:06:49,398
<i>Good. Now. Gentlemen.</i>

11
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:52,167
Do you see
these file folders?

12
00:06:52,168 --> 00:06:54,503
The ones with your names
on them?

13
00:06:54,504 --> 00:06:57,573
Can you guess
what's in these file folders?

14
00:06:57,574 --> 00:06:58,974
I'll give you
a hint.

15
00:06:58,975 --> 00:07:00,776
Discipline
reports.

16
00:07:00,777 --> 00:07:01,910
Lots of them.

17
00:07:01,911 --> 00:07:04,947
And some wonderful
artwork as well.

18
00:07:04,948 --> 00:07:05,814
This is...?

19
00:07:07,183 --> 00:07:09,218
Spider
with human head?

20
00:07:09,219 --> 00:07:11,386
I'm sorry. Spider?
With human head.

21
00:07:11,387 --> 00:07:15,357
Yeah. He eats dogs
and cats and rabbits.

22
00:07:15,358 --> 00:07:16,859
Does he?

23
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:18,861
Sean thought him up.
You see, sir,

24
00:07:18,862 --> 00:07:20,662
we kinda have
this monster club, okay?

25
00:07:20,663 --> 00:07:23,165
And we draw those pictures to put
on our clubhouse walls.

26
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:24,933
Correction,
Mr. Crenshaw.

27
00:07:24,934 --> 00:07:28,203
You draw pictures
during Mrs. Carlson's science class

28
00:07:28,204 --> 00:07:30,372
when you're supposed
to be paying attention.

29
00:07:30,373 --> 00:07:31,974
Wait. I just want
to say one thing.

30
00:07:31,975 --> 00:07:34,676
I mean, Ms. Carlson's
a nice teacher and all,

31
00:07:34,677 --> 00:07:36,979
but she's boring and
has an odd-shaped head.

32
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:39,014
That's why Sean and the guys
call her "Meow Mix,"

33
00:07:39,015 --> 00:07:41,016
'cause her head's
shaped like a cat head.

34
00:07:41,017 --> 00:07:43,352
But I don't, sir,
'cause... how rude.

35
00:07:46,823 --> 00:07:47,356
Boys...

36
00:07:48,992 --> 00:07:50,492
I hear you.

37
00:07:51,728 --> 00:07:53,362
I was a kid once.

38
00:07:53,363 --> 00:07:55,497
I thought monsters
were cool.

39
00:07:55,498 --> 00:07:57,432
And maybe, well...
well, gosh...

40
00:07:57,433 --> 00:07:58,767
maybe I'm
just a big kid,

41
00:07:58,768 --> 00:07:59,868
because, Sean, Patrick...

42
00:08:01,638 --> 00:08:03,605
...I think science

43
00:08:03,606 --> 00:08:04,373
is cool.

44
00:08:05,842 --> 00:08:07,676
I dig it, man.

45
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:11,480
Now, I'm sure
both of you know

46
00:08:11,481 --> 00:08:13,015
a great deal
about monsters,

47
00:08:13,016 --> 00:08:14,883
but that's not the issue here.
The issue is...

48
00:08:16,286 --> 00:08:18,687
...science is real.

49
00:08:18,688 --> 00:08:20,389
Monsters are not.

50
00:08:22,525 --> 00:08:23,859
We don't
know that, sir.

51
00:08:27,864 --> 00:08:29,631
God, can you believe
Mr. Metzger?

52
00:08:29,632 --> 00:08:32,501
Tell me about it. He touched me
and patted my shoulders and stuff.

53
00:08:32,502 --> 00:08:33,702
The guy was fully
homo-ing out.

54
00:08:33,703 --> 00:08:35,070
I smell like the '40s.

55
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:36,605
I mean, when they send you to school,
why don't they

56
00:08:36,606 --> 00:08:39,007
tell you about the homos and
people with cat heads...

57
00:08:46,216 --> 00:08:47,416
Sorry,
Mrs. Carlson.

58
00:08:51,287 --> 00:08:52,487
Meow. Meow.

59
00:08:52,488 --> 00:08:53,722
She's married, Sean.

60
00:08:53,723 --> 00:08:56,124
Oh, my God! Some guy
kisses her at night?

61
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:58,560
I mean, a priest said,
"I now pronounce you man and wife,"

62
00:08:58,561 --> 00:08:59,728
and it was
okay with him?

63
00:08:59,729 --> 00:09:00,429
Hey.
Where's Fat Kid?

64
00:09:04,734 --> 00:09:06,902
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen,
and welcome to our show.

65
00:09:06,903 --> 00:09:09,505
What makes Fat Kid fat?

66
00:09:09,506 --> 00:09:10,606
Fat kid?

67
00:09:10,607 --> 00:09:12,207
Get out of here,
E.J.

68
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:13,609
"Get out of here, E.J."
Nope.

69
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:15,244
Not a good answer.
Doesn't make any sense.

70
00:09:15,245 --> 00:09:17,145
Let's go to our man on the street. Derek.
Hi. I'm Derek,

71
00:09:17,146 --> 00:09:19,214
and I'm in the street
where Fat Kid is blocking traffic.

72
00:09:19,215 --> 00:09:20,449
Fat Kid, can't you
stop eating?

73
00:09:24,354 --> 00:09:26,455
Look, I have
a glandular problem, okay?

74
00:09:26,456 --> 00:09:29,458
At least I don't have a...
stupidity problem.

75
00:09:29,459 --> 00:09:31,293
What'd you say, faggot?
What'd you say?

76
00:09:31,294 --> 00:09:32,294
My name's Horace!

77
00:09:32,295 --> 00:09:33,295
Horace.

78
00:09:33,296 --> 00:09:33,962
Whore-ass.

79
00:09:39,269 --> 00:09:41,403
Oops.
I tore it.

80
00:09:41,404 --> 00:09:43,906
I guess I must have
a stupidity problem.

81
00:09:43,907 --> 00:09:46,575
What'd you say, faggot?
What'd you say?

82
00:09:46,576 --> 00:09:49,011
I said,
"You're an asshole."

83
00:10:08,765 --> 00:10:09,832
Hey, Rudy.

84
00:10:11,467 --> 00:10:12,334
E.J.

85
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:14,837
See you met
my friend Horace.

86
00:10:16,439 --> 00:10:17,840
You okay?

87
00:10:19,142 --> 00:10:20,342
Rudy, I, uh...

88
00:10:22,312 --> 00:10:23,879
You dropped
your candy bar, E.J.

89
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,214
It's his.

90
00:10:25,215 --> 00:10:26,849
It's your now.

91
00:10:29,319 --> 00:10:31,220
Rudy... Eat.

92
00:10:31,221 --> 00:10:33,755
Rudy, I'm not gonna...
Eat up!

93
00:10:33,756 --> 00:10:34,857
And we'll
call it a day.

94
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:59,381
Look, Patrick,
I told you before,

95
00:10:59,382 --> 00:11:01,517
Wolfman cannot drive a car.
Yes, he can.

96
00:11:01,518 --> 00:11:03,352
No, he can't!
Yes, he can.

97
00:11:03,353 --> 00:11:05,521
All I'm saying is,
Sean, he could if he had to.

98
00:11:05,522 --> 00:11:07,055
He could not. You're
being such a dork!

99
00:11:07,056 --> 00:11:08,524
I know you are, but what am I?
A dork.

100
00:11:08,525 --> 00:11:09,691
<i>I know you are,
but what am I?</i>

101
00:11:09,692 --> 00:11:10,893
Oh, great. A feeb.
A dork.

102
00:11:10,894 --> 00:11:12,461
I know you are,
but what am I?
A dork.

103
00:11:12,462 --> 00:11:14,263
<i>I know you are,
but what am I?
Infinity! Look,</i>

104
00:11:14,264 --> 00:11:16,899
Wolfman doesn't go to work.
He's not, like, a guy.

105
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:18,200
What are you
talkin' about?

106
00:11:18,201 --> 00:11:19,968
He walks around.
He wears pants.

107
00:11:19,969 --> 00:11:23,205
He had to wear pants
'cause those movies
were made in the '40s.

108
00:11:23,206 --> 00:11:25,207
He had to wear 'em
so you wouldn't see his...

109
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:25,908
wolf dork.

110
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:28,410
Wolf dork?

111
00:11:31,181 --> 00:11:32,881
You guys!

112
00:11:34,884 --> 00:11:37,052
I saw him.
He was watching us.

113
00:11:37,053 --> 00:11:38,053
Who?

114
00:11:38,054 --> 00:11:39,421
Scary German Guy.

115
00:11:41,724 --> 00:11:43,425
Sean, he give me
the creeps.

116
00:11:43,426 --> 00:11:45,394
Oh, he's just
a dude on welfare.

117
00:11:45,395 --> 00:11:46,962
Maybe he's
a German spy.

118
00:11:46,963 --> 00:11:49,164
Oh, good one.
We're not at war
with Germany anymore.

119
00:11:49,165 --> 00:11:51,033
We're at war
with Vietnam.

120
00:11:51,034 --> 00:11:52,034
What?

121
00:11:52,035 --> 00:11:53,202
<i>It's in Rambo.</i>

122
00:11:53,203 --> 00:11:55,470
You guys missed it!
Oh! Fat Kid!

123
00:11:55,471 --> 00:11:56,905
Rudy saved my life!

124
00:11:56,906 --> 00:11:59,241
Do you think we could
talk him into joining
the Monster Club?

125
00:11:59,242 --> 00:12:00,909
Can we?

126
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:01,443
Huddle.
Huddle.

127
00:12:02,912 --> 00:12:04,646
Sean, he's
in junior high.

128
00:12:04,647 --> 00:12:06,348
I hear he killed his dad.

129
00:12:06,349 --> 00:12:08,450
Get out of here,
Phoebe the Feeb!

130
00:12:13,423 --> 00:12:16,458
Okay, you guys.
We should let him in
on one condition.

131
00:12:18,228 --> 00:12:19,461
Monster test.

132
00:12:28,571 --> 00:12:30,772
You guys!
I saw Scary...

133
00:12:30,773 --> 00:12:31,807
I saw him!

134
00:12:31,808 --> 00:12:33,642
I saw Scary German Guy!

135
00:12:33,643 --> 00:12:34,476
He was watching!

136
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,947
<i>I'm depressed.</i>

137
00:12:38,948 --> 00:12:40,382
What for?
What do you mean,
what for?

138
00:12:40,383 --> 00:12:41,950
I'm flyin'
a World War II bomber

139
00:12:41,951 --> 00:12:43,552
with wooden crates in it
and dead bodies.

140
00:12:43,553 --> 00:12:44,686
I should have a party?

141
00:12:44,687 --> 00:12:47,289
Do they complain?
Do they get airsick?

142
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:48,991
Do they ask for more
of the little almond
things?

143
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:50,993
You're right.

144
00:12:52,462 --> 00:12:54,363
This is a great job.
I'm really happy.

145
00:13:02,472 --> 00:13:03,572
I thought they were dead.

146
00:13:03,573 --> 00:13:04,506
They are.

147
00:13:07,544 --> 00:13:08,510
I'm goin' to, uh...

148
00:13:10,647 --> 00:13:12,014
I'm gonna
check it out.

149
00:13:13,316 --> 00:13:15,017
Okay. Good.

150
00:13:16,319 --> 00:13:17,486
You do that.

151
00:13:19,155 --> 00:13:21,523
I'll stay here and
make spooky sounds.

152
00:13:45,014 --> 00:13:46,515
Come on.

153
00:13:46,516 --> 00:13:47,516
Come on.

154
00:13:47,517 --> 00:13:49,117
Come on.
Where are you,

155
00:13:49,118 --> 00:13:51,687
you son of a bitch?

156
00:14:57,754 --> 00:14:59,254
Two ways to kill
a vampire.

157
00:14:59,255 --> 00:15:00,756
Good one, Fat Kid.
Excellent question.

158
00:15:00,757 --> 00:15:01,757
Uh, stake through the heart.

159
00:15:01,758 --> 00:15:03,025
Right.
What else?

160
00:15:03,026 --> 00:15:04,226
Oh, real good.

161
00:15:04,227 --> 00:15:05,427
Eugene.
I wasn't talking.

162
00:15:05,428 --> 00:15:07,563
Get him in a muzzle,
will ya?
It was Pete.

163
00:15:07,564 --> 00:15:09,097
You guys meet up here
a lot, or, uh...

164
00:15:09,098 --> 00:15:10,265
Every day.

165
00:15:10,266 --> 00:15:11,266
Do we meet up here a lot?

166
00:15:11,267 --> 00:15:12,668
Eugene!
Man!

167
00:15:12,669 --> 00:15:14,203
Eugene, make
Pete shut up.

168
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:16,138
Do you really think
that was a good question?

169
00:15:16,139 --> 00:15:19,074
Rudy!
Are you gonna listen or
look out the window?

170
00:15:19,075 --> 00:15:20,709
I told you he didn't want
to be in the club.

171
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:21,710
Lighten up, Patrick.

172
00:15:21,711 --> 00:15:23,245
No way!

173
00:15:23,246 --> 00:15:24,613
Hey, we're tryin'
to do the test
here, you know.

174
00:15:24,614 --> 00:15:25,781
You're gonna
piss him off.

175
00:15:25,782 --> 00:15:26,882
I'm beginnin'
to like this club.

176
00:15:26,883 --> 00:15:29,785
Rudy! Come on.
It's a monster test.

177
00:15:29,786 --> 00:15:30,819
It's important. Okay?

178
00:15:34,624 --> 00:15:36,358
Second way
to kill a vampire.

179
00:15:38,461 --> 00:15:41,129
Mmm... I give up.

180
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:42,197
Daylight.

181
00:15:42,198 --> 00:15:43,966
Sunlight.
Ha ha ha!
Fat Kid,

182
00:15:43,967 --> 00:15:46,034
what other kind
of light is there
durin' the day?

183
00:15:46,035 --> 00:15:48,203
Go away, Pete!
Okay, question two.

184
00:15:48,204 --> 00:15:51,573
Is Frankenstein
the name of the monster
or the guy who made him?

185
00:15:51,574 --> 00:15:53,041
The guy.
Right.

186
00:15:56,312 --> 00:15:57,379
Can't you read?

187
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:59,481
Mom said you have to let me
in the club,

188
00:15:59,482 --> 00:16:01,617
or else it's prescruption.

189
00:16:01,618 --> 00:16:03,685
That's discrimination,
jerkoid.

190
00:16:03,686 --> 00:16:06,421
"Prescription" is drugs,
which you're on if you
think you're gettin' up here.

191
00:16:06,422 --> 00:16:08,257
Come on, Sean!
I know about monsters.

192
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:10,626
Come on! Let me in the club!
Two ways to kill a werewolf.

193
00:16:10,627 --> 00:16:11,627
Silver bullet?

194
00:16:11,628 --> 00:16:13,128
And?

195
00:16:13,129 --> 00:16:14,997
That's it. Shoot him
with a sliver bullet.

196
00:16:14,998 --> 00:16:16,198
Nope. Sorry, Rudy.

197
00:16:16,199 --> 00:16:17,266
Ha ha!

198
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:17,900
Okay, so, what's
the other way?

199
00:16:19,969 --> 00:16:20,969
What?

200
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:22,171
Second way
to kill a werewolf?

201
00:16:22,172 --> 00:16:24,106
Um...
Car crash?

202
00:16:24,107 --> 00:16:25,407
Accident
with power tools?

203
00:16:25,408 --> 00:16:27,609
Old age?
Falling out a window.

204
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:30,479
Onto a bomb!
Sean! Phoebe! Dinner!

205
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,413
Oops. Gotta go.

206
00:16:33,183 --> 00:16:35,417
Wait. Am I in or what?

207
00:16:38,188 --> 00:16:39,188
I mean it, spaz.

208
00:16:39,189 --> 00:16:41,023
You gotta
stop it.

209
00:16:42,759 --> 00:16:45,027
Wash up
for dinner,
guys.

210
00:16:45,028 --> 00:16:47,529
Boring guy, boring guy,
boring guy, boring guy.

211
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:48,530
What's this, Mom?

212
00:16:48,531 --> 00:16:50,532
Huh? Oh, I got that
for you today

213
00:16:50,533 --> 00:16:52,301
at Jane Burgess'
garage sale.

214
00:16:52,302 --> 00:16:53,468
Says it's
from that old house

215
00:16:53,469 --> 00:16:54,870
up on Shadowbrook Road.

216
00:16:54,871 --> 00:16:57,840
Holy shit! Uh, sor... cow.
Um, I'm sorry.

217
00:16:57,841 --> 00:16:59,007
Mom, do you know
who wrote this book?

218
00:16:59,008 --> 00:17:01,310
Yeah. It's, what,
Van Helsing something.

219
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:03,445
Now, he's the one
that fights Godzilla.
Right?

220
00:17:03,446 --> 00:17:04,780
Dracula, Mom.

221
00:17:04,781 --> 00:17:06,048
Well, then which
is the really tall one?

222
00:17:06,049 --> 00:17:08,016
That's Godzilla.

223
00:17:08,017 --> 00:17:10,118
My God!
Abraham Van Helsing.

224
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:10,953
This is great!

225
00:17:14,224 --> 00:17:14,957
This is German.

226
00:17:36,412 --> 00:17:37,479
Let it begin.

227
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,367
Hey, slick.

228
00:17:58,368 --> 00:17:59,001
Busy day?

229
00:18:02,605 --> 00:18:03,505
Not really.

230
00:18:04,774 --> 00:18:06,408
Shoot any crooks today?
Afraid not.

231
00:18:06,409 --> 00:18:08,644
But I still may
if you don't
wash up for dinner.

232
00:18:09,779 --> 00:18:11,613
What's
on your mind?

233
00:18:11,614 --> 00:18:13,682
Well, Dad, uh, some
of the guys and me

234
00:18:13,683 --> 00:18:16,885
<i>were maybe gonna go see
Groundhog Day Part 12 tonight,
only if it's okay with you.</i>

235
00:18:16,886 --> 00:18:17,886
Is it? Please?

236
00:18:17,887 --> 00:18:18,954
Oh, we got
a problem.

237
00:18:18,955 --> 00:18:20,622
No way!
Yes, way.

238
00:18:20,623 --> 00:18:22,324
I gotta go out
with your mother
tonight.

239
00:18:22,325 --> 00:18:23,892
You got a certain
5-year-old sister

240
00:18:23,893 --> 00:18:25,093
who needs baby-sitting.
Oh, come on, Dad!

241
00:18:25,094 --> 00:18:27,095
I've waited all year
to see this movie!

242
00:18:27,096 --> 00:18:29,865
Pal, it's only a movie.
Look, tomorrow night,

243
00:18:29,866 --> 00:18:31,233
<i>you and I'll go see
Groundhog Day.</i>

244
00:18:31,234 --> 00:18:33,101
I'll get home
early.

245
00:18:33,102 --> 00:18:35,437
Tomorrow night?
That'll be too late!

246
00:18:35,438 --> 00:18:37,639
The guys will blab
the entire plot!

247
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,975
What?
Did I hear "plot"?

248
00:18:39,976 --> 00:18:42,044
Sean, it is a guy
with an ax.

249
00:18:42,045 --> 00:18:44,146
Anyway, I thought
they killed him
in the last one.

250
00:18:44,147 --> 00:18:46,648
They did.
And he returns
from his grave.

251
00:18:46,649 --> 00:18:47,783
Returns
from the grave?

252
00:18:47,784 --> 00:18:50,652
Sean, he always
returns from the grave.

253
00:18:50,653 --> 00:18:52,421
If they blew him up,
put his head in a blender,

254
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:53,856
and mailed the rest
of the pieces to Norway,

255
00:18:53,857 --> 00:18:56,058
he would still
return from the grave.
That was part seven.

256
00:18:57,494 --> 00:18:59,127
You want to know
what the plot is?

257
00:18:59,128 --> 00:19:00,963
The plot separates you
from my five bucks.

258
00:19:00,964 --> 00:19:02,364
I want to see
a stupid movie.

259
00:19:02,365 --> 00:19:04,299
Well, you can't.
You're baby-sitting.

260
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:07,135
Fine. Can I have
five bucks anyway?

261
00:19:07,136 --> 00:19:08,504
Absolutely.

262
00:19:08,505 --> 00:19:10,339
So, where you two
goin' tonight?

263
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:11,840
Marriage counselor.

264
00:19:11,841 --> 00:19:12,841
Again?

265
00:19:12,842 --> 00:19:14,076
I thought
you quit smoking.

266
00:19:15,645 --> 00:19:16,578
Sean.

267
00:19:19,349 --> 00:19:22,851
Son, I love you dearly,
but do me a favor.

268
00:19:22,852 --> 00:19:23,986
Put your basic lid
on it.

269
00:19:25,955 --> 00:19:27,089
Now, get
outta here.

270
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,493
Hello. Yeah?

271
00:19:31,494 --> 00:19:32,995
Officer, please!
Lock me up!

272
00:19:32,996 --> 00:19:35,063
Lock...
Yeah. I'm a werewolf!
I'm a werewolf!

273
00:19:35,064 --> 00:19:36,532
Please. Please.
Hey, Del.

274
00:19:36,533 --> 00:19:38,100
I know it sounds
crazy, but...
Bad news.

275
00:19:47,277 --> 00:19:48,610
Listen, I gotta
go downtown.

276
00:19:50,547 --> 00:19:52,114
Can you reschedule
that appointment?

277
00:19:53,883 --> 00:19:55,117
Honey, I'm a cop,
okay?

278
00:19:56,386 --> 00:19:57,619
You knew that
when you bought
the package.

279
00:19:59,289 --> 00:20:00,856
Look.
It's important.

280
00:20:00,857 --> 00:20:02,191
I'm important.

281
00:20:02,192 --> 00:20:03,492
I love you.

282
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:05,727
Prove it.

283
00:20:05,728 --> 00:20:07,129
I'll see you
in a few hours.

284
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:10,833
Just for a night!

285
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:11,967
You see,
it's a full moon!

286
00:20:11,968 --> 00:20:13,268
And I'm a werewolf!
Take it easy.

287
00:20:13,269 --> 00:20:15,337
You don't understand!
You gotta lock me up!

288
00:20:15,338 --> 00:20:16,738
You gotta put me
in a cage!

289
00:20:16,739 --> 00:20:19,174
Buddy,
I'd like nothin' better!
Hold onto your pants!

290
00:20:19,175 --> 00:20:21,844
Oh, God! You
don't understand!
You've gotta...

291
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:23,912
Anything you say,
fella.

292
00:20:23,913 --> 00:20:25,414
Put the cuffs on him.

293
00:20:25,415 --> 00:20:28,317
I got it.
All right.
I got him now.

294
00:20:29,419 --> 00:20:30,986
Jesus Christ!
We need some backup!

295
00:20:34,657 --> 00:20:35,991
Bon voyage!

296
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,000
Lock me up!

297
00:20:50,273 --> 00:20:52,274
So, let me
get this straight.

298
00:20:52,275 --> 00:20:53,375
You tellin' me
there was

299
00:20:53,376 --> 00:20:55,611
this 2,000-year-old
mummy here, right?

300
00:20:55,612 --> 00:20:57,613
Yes, sir.

301
00:20:57,614 --> 00:20:59,515
Well, now he's not
here. He's gone.
Vanished. History.

302
00:20:59,516 --> 00:21:01,116
Yes, sir.

303
00:21:01,117 --> 00:21:02,684
And you're sayin'
you didn't hear anybody

304
00:21:02,685 --> 00:21:04,653
come in here or leave.
Is that right?

305
00:21:04,654 --> 00:21:06,221
Can you hear me now?
Hello?

306
00:21:06,222 --> 00:21:08,524
I can
hear you fine.

307
00:21:08,525 --> 00:21:10,092
So, nobody
took the mummy.

308
00:21:10,093 --> 00:21:11,793
I would've heard them.

309
00:21:11,794 --> 00:21:13,529
Of course he would've.
What a stupid question.

310
00:21:15,198 --> 00:21:16,365
Did you take him?

311
00:21:16,366 --> 00:21:17,432
No, sir!

312
00:21:17,433 --> 00:21:18,467
Just a shot.

313
00:21:18,468 --> 00:21:20,269
That's it, Del.

314
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:21,870
This case is
too hard, man.

315
00:21:21,871 --> 00:21:23,539
Let's be firemen
instead.

316
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:25,774
I'm glad you're gettin'
major laughs
out of this, Rich.

317
00:21:25,775 --> 00:21:29,077
The problem is,
2,000-year-old dead guys

318
00:21:29,078 --> 00:21:31,046
do not get up
and walk away
by themself.

319
00:21:51,267 --> 00:21:52,634
<i>Accident patrol,</i>

320
00:21:52,635 --> 00:21:54,336
<i>uh, request confirmation.</i>

321
00:21:54,337 --> 00:21:57,573
<i>You have the 915-H
officer-involved shooting
en route?</i>

322
00:22:33,042 --> 00:22:34,710
<i>My God!
You scared me!</i>

323
00:22:34,711 --> 00:22:35,944
<i>Where are Steve
and Judy?</i>

324
00:22:35,945 --> 00:22:37,379
<i>I thought
they were with you.</i>

325
00:22:41,384 --> 00:22:42,784
<i>Not funny.</i>

326
00:22:42,785 --> 00:22:44,887
<i>Well, something
funny's...</i>

327
00:22:44,888 --> 00:22:45,888
What did I miss?

328
00:22:45,889 --> 00:22:47,623
<i>Judy? Steve?</i>

329
00:22:50,226 --> 00:22:51,627
<i>Hey!</i>

330
00:22:51,628 --> 00:22:53,962
<i>Oh, sheriff.
You scared us.</i>

331
00:22:53,963 --> 00:22:55,097
<i>Never mind about that.</i>

332
00:23:00,904 --> 00:23:01,904
This is
the best part.

333
00:23:01,905 --> 00:23:03,238
<i>Judy!</i>

334
00:23:03,239 --> 00:23:04,406
<i>No!</i>

335
00:23:04,407 --> 00:23:05,407
Lieutenant,
you wanna come over

336
00:23:05,408 --> 00:23:06,675
and take a look at this?

337
00:23:06,676 --> 00:23:08,143
<i>Dispatch, Unit 7.</i>

338
00:23:09,245 --> 00:23:11,413
<i>Unit 7,
come in, please.</i>

339
00:23:11,414 --> 00:23:13,081
<i>Please copy.</i>

340
00:23:13,082 --> 00:23:14,850
Wonderful. Great!
Just what I need.

341
00:23:14,851 --> 00:23:16,251
<i>Come again? You're...
What?</i>

342
00:23:16,252 --> 00:23:17,886
<i>Uh, request,
uh, cadaver...</i>

343
00:23:17,887 --> 00:23:20,923
I can't hear you!
No, no, no!
I said "missing"!

344
00:23:20,924 --> 00:23:23,158
The body's missing!
It's the second one
tonight.

345
00:23:23,159 --> 00:23:25,093
<i>Confirmed. That
makes two tonight,
right, Lieutenant?</i>

346
00:23:25,094 --> 00:23:26,662
<i>Ha, ha.
That's very funny.</i>

347
00:23:26,663 --> 00:23:28,497
<i>And you want
to shut up about it?</i>

348
00:25:13,036 --> 00:25:14,269
It's been so long.

349
00:25:22,212 --> 00:25:23,779
So very long.

350
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,306
Wake up,
old friend.

351
00:25:53,376 --> 00:25:55,310
It is our time.

352
00:26:22,772 --> 00:26:25,340
Long... time...

353
00:26:26,743 --> 00:26:28,343
...Master.

354
00:26:46,963 --> 00:26:50,532
And you put the candle
next to your bed
like this.

355
00:26:50,533 --> 00:26:53,068
Your mom did this
when you were a little girl?

356
00:26:54,103 --> 00:26:55,637
It means
"I love you."

357
00:26:55,638 --> 00:26:57,906
And as long
as it's here, nothing
bad can happen.

358
00:26:57,907 --> 00:27:01,376
Sean says
when it lightnings,
monsters come.

359
00:27:01,377 --> 00:27:03,979
Oh, he's just trying
to scare you, honey.

360
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:05,647
Will lightning
hit the house?

361
00:27:05,648 --> 00:27:06,782
No.

362
00:27:06,783 --> 00:27:08,383
The candle
keeps it away?

363
00:27:09,886 --> 00:27:10,853
That's right.

364
00:27:12,488 --> 00:27:14,089
Say goodnight
to Scraps.

365
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:15,424
Goodnight, Scraps.

366
00:27:15,425 --> 00:27:17,059
Good night, Emily.
Mwah.

367
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:18,393
Good night,
sweetheart.

368
00:27:19,996 --> 00:27:21,897
Are you gonna
yell at him?

369
00:27:24,667 --> 00:27:26,869
Honey...
I love your father.

370
00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:28,804
What?

371
00:27:28,805 --> 00:27:30,339
I mean Sean,

372
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:31,907
for scaring me.

373
00:27:33,042 --> 00:27:34,676
Of course you did.

374
00:27:34,677 --> 00:27:36,678
I'll talk to him
about it, sweetheart.

375
00:27:36,679 --> 00:27:37,913
Sweet dreams.

376
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:45,621
You're thinkin'
about your job,

377
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:46,788
isn't that right?

378
00:27:46,789 --> 00:27:48,757
I can see it
in your eyes, Del.

379
00:27:48,758 --> 00:27:51,293
Yeah! I'm glad you can
see it in my eyes,

380
00:27:51,294 --> 00:27:53,128
'cause for a minute there
I thought I had you fooled.

381
00:27:53,129 --> 00:27:54,129
Come on, this isn't...
No, come on!

382
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:56,198
Look in my eyes.
Look in my eyes!

383
00:27:56,199 --> 00:27:57,699
I'll think
about stuff,
and you can tell me

384
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:59,034
when I'm
thinking correctly!

385
00:27:59,035 --> 00:28:00,035
Keep your
voice down.

386
00:28:00,036 --> 00:28:01,270
I don't want
the children...

387
00:28:01,271 --> 00:28:03,005
I had a lousy night,
all right?

388
00:28:03,006 --> 00:28:04,806
Every night
I have a lousy night.

389
00:28:04,807 --> 00:28:07,976
I'm sorry it's such
a pain in the ass for you
with my stupid little job!

390
00:28:07,977 --> 00:28:09,545
I am trying to explain...

391
00:28:09,546 --> 00:28:12,714
Some guy steals
a priceless Egyptian mummy...

392
00:28:12,715 --> 00:28:14,483
That happens every day.
Skip that.

393
00:28:14,484 --> 00:28:16,185
Then I get a call
from some nutcase

394
00:28:16,186 --> 00:28:17,753
who's shouting
he's a werewolf!

395
00:28:17,754 --> 00:28:18,987
Huh? You like that?

396
00:28:18,988 --> 00:28:21,023
What do they do?
They blow him away

397
00:28:21,024 --> 00:28:22,457
right there
in the police station!

398
00:28:22,458 --> 00:28:25,694
Wait a minute!
There is more to this!

399
00:28:31,734 --> 00:28:33,302
...marriage counseling!
For what?

400
00:29:08,137 --> 00:29:09,271
Wha?

401
00:29:09,272 --> 00:29:11,807
There's a monster
in my closet.

402
00:29:15,445 --> 00:29:17,279
Damn, son, look!

403
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,281
All of these monsters!

404
00:29:19,282 --> 00:29:20,949
Come on,
all of you monsters,
outta here!

405
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:23,385
Everyone,
out of this room!
Come...

406
00:29:23,386 --> 00:29:26,655
You, on the bed.
Come on. Out. Out.
Take a hike.

407
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:27,322
There he goes.

408
00:29:29,959 --> 00:29:30,826
You see
any more monsters?

409
00:29:36,466 --> 00:29:37,332
In the closet?

410
00:29:38,801 --> 00:29:40,802
Sure. We can go
into the closet.

411
00:29:40,803 --> 00:29:41,837
We can do that.

412
00:29:43,973 --> 00:29:45,841
Okay, monsters!

413
00:29:49,612 --> 00:29:52,147
Look at that big,
scary monster!

414
00:29:55,151 --> 00:29:57,319
Listen. You are
not gonna sleep

415
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,453
with your mother
and me tonight,

416
00:29:58,454 --> 00:29:59,621
so you can
forget it.

417
00:29:59,622 --> 00:30:01,089
And keep this up,

418
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:03,392
and you're not gonna look
at those monster magazines.

419
00:30:03,393 --> 00:30:04,359
Understand?

420
00:30:20,844 --> 00:30:22,244
Okay.
We're all here.

421
00:30:22,245 --> 00:30:23,512
What's
the deal?

422
00:30:23,513 --> 00:30:25,480
Yeah.
What the hell's
Monster Squad?

423
00:30:25,481 --> 00:30:26,849
It's us.

424
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:28,584
We're
the Monster
Squad.

425
00:30:28,585 --> 00:30:29,618
Since when?

426
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:30,686
Since now!

427
00:30:30,687 --> 00:30:32,688
What's a "squad"?

428
00:30:32,689 --> 00:30:33,889
<i>It's like
Miami Vice, I think.</i>

429
00:30:35,225 --> 00:30:37,359
Look. I think
there's monsters.

430
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,527
Like, real ones.

431
00:30:38,528 --> 00:30:40,195
I heard my dad talking
on the telephone

432
00:30:40,196 --> 00:30:41,730
to a guy down
at the police station.

433
00:30:41,731 --> 00:30:44,099
There was a guy screaming
he was a werewolf.

434
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:47,169
And they shot him.
And the body disappeared
from the coroner van.

435
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:49,037
And the coroner guy
was dead.

436
00:30:49,038 --> 00:30:52,140
So what? He got shot,
and the werewolf
took his body?

437
00:30:52,141 --> 00:30:55,644
<i>No, you pinhead!
He was a werewolf!
Maybe.</i>

438
00:30:55,645 --> 00:30:56,778
But if they shot him...

439
00:30:56,779 --> 00:30:58,080
They must've been
regular bullets,

440
00:30:58,081 --> 00:30:59,882
not silver ones.

441
00:30:59,883 --> 00:31:01,850
Look, I know
this will sound
pretty stupid,

442
00:31:01,851 --> 00:31:04,653
but a mummy disappeared
from the museum tonight.

443
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:06,922
Mummy came
in my house.

444
00:31:09,392 --> 00:31:10,893
And, guys...

445
00:31:10,894 --> 00:31:12,427
Dracula might
be here, too.

446
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:16,131
Aw, man,
Fat Kid farted!

447
00:31:16,132 --> 00:31:17,499
Oh, God.
Did not.

448
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,568
Can't you
hold it? God!

449
00:31:19,569 --> 00:31:22,304
God damn it,
would you shut up?

450
00:31:22,305 --> 00:31:23,639
Did you hear
a word I said?

451
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:26,074
The guys are dead!
Get a clue!

452
00:31:26,075 --> 00:31:27,976
Something's out there,
and it's killin' people!

453
00:31:27,977 --> 00:31:30,946
And if it's monsters,
nobody's gonna do a thing
about it but us.

454
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:34,449
So, what do we do?

455
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:37,586
Think this book
might be important.

456
00:31:37,587 --> 00:31:39,054
Look. It's
Van Helsing's diary.

457
00:31:39,055 --> 00:31:40,589
Mom said they found it
in an old house

458
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:42,257
on Shadowbrook Road.

459
00:31:42,258 --> 00:31:44,159
But I can't read it.
It's all in German.

460
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,094
My sister takes German
in high school.

461
00:31:46,095 --> 00:31:48,363
Your sister
doesn't speak German.
All she does

462
00:31:48,364 --> 00:31:50,866
is hang around,
and the guys
touch her tits.

463
00:31:50,867 --> 00:31:52,768
Your sister wouldn't
happen to live next-door,
would she?

464
00:31:52,769 --> 00:31:54,102
So what?

465
00:31:54,103 --> 00:31:55,938
That girl's
your sister?

466
00:31:57,874 --> 00:32:00,475
So, what do you say?
Are we Monster Squad...

467
00:32:01,778 --> 00:32:02,477
...or what?

468
00:32:08,952 --> 00:32:10,919
Cool.
All right.

469
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:13,488
How does that dog
get up here, anyways?

470
00:32:51,995 --> 00:32:53,028
Old friend.

471
00:32:54,664 --> 00:32:56,031
How do you like
your new home?

472
00:32:57,834 --> 00:32:58,534
Home.

473
00:33:18,521 --> 00:33:20,522
I must
sleep soon,

474
00:33:20,523 --> 00:33:22,257
so listen
very carefully.

475
00:33:22,258 --> 00:33:24,560
Van Helsing's diary...

476
00:33:25,728 --> 00:33:26,562
...is missing.

477
00:33:28,031 --> 00:33:29,565
I want you
to retrieve it
for me.

478
00:33:31,201 --> 00:33:32,067
You understand?

479
00:33:33,369 --> 00:33:34,870
Yes...

480
00:33:34,871 --> 00:33:36,004
Master.

481
00:33:36,005 --> 00:33:38,073
Children... possess it.

482
00:33:39,709 --> 00:33:43,178
I want you
to find them
and take the diary.

483
00:33:43,179 --> 00:33:45,080
If they do not
cooperate...

484
00:33:47,217 --> 00:33:48,083
...you will kill them.

485
00:33:52,722 --> 00:33:55,891
Gentlemen, I'd just like
to say three words:

486
00:33:55,892 --> 00:33:59,094
Scary German Guy.

487
00:34:02,732 --> 00:34:04,600
Who else are we
gonna get to translate
this thing?

488
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:08,904
Come on. Somebody
go up and knock.

489
00:34:08,905 --> 00:34:11,106
<i>You knock.
You're our leader.</i>

490
00:34:14,277 --> 00:34:15,677
Firstly, he's scary, okay?

491
00:34:15,678 --> 00:34:18,080
And "B,"
he's German.

492
00:34:18,081 --> 00:34:20,282
Maybe he doesn't
even speak English.

493
00:34:20,283 --> 00:34:22,117
Okay, so what's
German for...

494
00:34:22,118 --> 00:34:23,752
"Please don't
murder us"?

495
00:34:23,753 --> 00:34:26,622
<i>Bitte, moerden-zie
uns nicht.</i>

496
00:34:51,514 --> 00:34:53,282
Boys...

497
00:34:53,283 --> 00:34:56,652
time is almost up.

498
00:34:58,121 --> 00:35:01,390
It's your
last chance for pie.

499
00:35:01,391 --> 00:35:03,926
Thanks, Mister, uh, guy.
Now, here we go.

500
00:35:03,927 --> 00:35:05,160
I mean...
No, thanks.

501
00:35:10,533 --> 00:35:12,334
<i>So? Ja?</i>

502
00:35:12,335 --> 00:35:14,670
Now, where
were we?

503
00:35:16,639 --> 00:35:18,140
<i>Ah... ja.</i>

504
00:35:18,141 --> 00:35:21,109
"The amulet itself
is fairly small

505
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:24,446
and carved with
intricate symbols."

506
00:35:26,549 --> 00:35:27,950
Rather an odd-looking
thing,

507
00:35:27,951 --> 00:35:29,251
don't you think?

508
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:30,919
Scary German
Guy's bitchin'.

509
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:33,322
Sir, the thing
I don't understand is

510
00:35:33,323 --> 00:35:34,623
the part about
the equilibrium.

511
00:35:34,624 --> 00:35:36,925
Well, according
to this rather
curious book

512
00:35:36,926 --> 00:35:38,360
you have
brought me,

513
00:35:38,361 --> 00:35:41,797
"The forces
of good and evil..."

514
00:35:41,798 --> 00:35:45,601
Uh, that is a B-17,
in case you are
wondering.

515
00:35:45,602 --> 00:35:46,201
It's rad!

516
00:35:47,637 --> 00:35:48,637
"Good and evil

517
00:35:48,638 --> 00:35:50,105
"are
in constant flux,

518
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:51,306
"back and forth.

519
00:35:51,307 --> 00:35:54,243
"Only once,
every hundred years,

520
00:35:54,244 --> 00:35:56,912
are these forces
balanced."

521
00:35:56,913 --> 00:35:58,413
And what about
the amulet?

522
00:35:58,414 --> 00:36:02,351
The amulet,
so nearly as I
can translate,

523
00:36:02,352 --> 00:36:06,522
is "concentrated good.

524
00:36:06,523 --> 00:36:08,056
"It is a talisman

525
00:36:08,057 --> 00:36:12,194
which wards off evil
and is..."

526
00:36:12,195 --> 00:36:13,729
how you say, uh...

527
00:36:14,931 --> 00:36:16,865
"indestructible"?

528
00:36:16,866 --> 00:36:18,734
That means
it can't be
destroyed.

529
00:36:18,735 --> 00:36:20,536
Or, in any case,

530
00:36:20,537 --> 00:36:23,639
normally destroyed.
However,

531
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:26,375
and this part
is underlined...

532
00:36:26,376 --> 00:36:29,978
"Once
every hundred years,

533
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:33,048
"at the stoke
of midnight,

534
00:36:33,049 --> 00:36:37,219
"the amulet
becomes vulnerable,

535
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:39,087
"and at that moment,

536
00:36:39,088 --> 00:36:40,956
it can be
shattered."

537
00:36:42,192 --> 00:36:42,958
And if it is?

538
00:36:44,494 --> 00:36:45,494
Then the balance

539
00:36:45,495 --> 00:36:47,029
between
good and evil

540
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:50,465
will shift,
and evil will rule.

541
00:36:52,902 --> 00:36:55,637
However, our friend
Mr. Van Helsing

542
00:36:55,638 --> 00:37:00,576
claims there is a way
to stop the forces
of darkness.

543
00:37:00,577 --> 00:37:01,476
How?

544
00:37:02,579 --> 00:37:04,947
"If one
could gain possession

545
00:37:04,948 --> 00:37:07,983
of the amulet
before those forces..."

546
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:12,287
"...then
every hundred years,

547
00:37:12,288 --> 00:37:14,089
"at midnight,

548
00:37:14,090 --> 00:37:16,058
"there is
another option:

549
00:37:16,059 --> 00:37:21,497
"a ceremony which,
when followed
to the letter,

550
00:37:21,498 --> 00:37:24,199
"will open a hole

551
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,502
"into Limbo itself

552
00:37:26,503 --> 00:37:29,571
"where dwell
the damned;

553
00:37:29,572 --> 00:37:30,873
"a vortex,

554
00:37:30,874 --> 00:37:34,610
"which like
a great whirlwind,

555
00:37:34,611 --> 00:37:38,514
"can swallow
the forces of evil
forever."

556
00:37:41,751 --> 00:37:44,686
Well... does it describe
the procedure at all?

557
00:37:44,687 --> 00:37:45,888
In detail.

558
00:37:45,889 --> 00:37:47,990
This was the last entry.

559
00:37:47,991 --> 00:37:50,359
On this date,

560
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:54,096
he was to battle
those forces himself.

561
00:37:54,097 --> 00:37:55,631
Interesting.

562
00:37:55,632 --> 00:37:57,766
It is
tomorrow's date,

563
00:37:57,767 --> 00:38:00,035
one hundred years ago!

564
00:38:07,810 --> 00:38:09,044
A hundred years ago?

565
00:38:11,814 --> 00:38:13,549
Tomorrow night.

566
00:38:16,819 --> 00:38:17,953
Thank you very much.
Thanks.

567
00:38:17,954 --> 00:38:19,788
Bye. Thank you
very much
for all your time.

568
00:38:19,789 --> 00:38:21,757
Thank you.
I expect
you boys thought

569
00:38:21,758 --> 00:38:24,893
I was some kind
of monster myself?

570
00:38:24,894 --> 00:38:26,762
A vampire, perhaps?

571
00:38:26,763 --> 00:38:28,764
That's quite
all right.

572
00:38:28,765 --> 00:38:30,666
But I am not,
you know.

573
00:38:30,667 --> 00:38:32,568
If I were
a vampire,

574
00:38:32,569 --> 00:38:35,070
then I wouldn't have
a reflection.

575
00:38:38,508 --> 00:38:39,575
Now, would I?

576
00:38:41,177 --> 00:38:44,313
Man, you sure know
a lot about monsters.

577
00:38:44,314 --> 00:38:47,683
Now that
you mention it...

578
00:38:47,684 --> 00:38:49,585
I suppose I do.

579
00:38:55,091 --> 00:38:55,591
Guys, wait up!

580
00:38:59,028 --> 00:39:01,363
Tomorrow night?
What do we have to
do again?

581
00:39:01,364 --> 00:39:02,631
Blow a hole
in Dumbo?

582
00:39:02,632 --> 00:39:03,866
Limbo, stupid.

583
00:39:03,867 --> 00:39:05,100
So, how do
we know

584
00:39:05,101 --> 00:39:06,802
the amulet's
there, anyway?

585
00:39:06,803 --> 00:39:09,905
Because, you dweeb,
Dracula's obviously
here looking for it.

586
00:39:09,906 --> 00:39:13,208
If we don't find it
before he does,
we're beast bait.

587
00:39:13,209 --> 00:39:14,643
Okay, so,
say we get
the amulet.

588
00:39:14,644 --> 00:39:15,711
Then what?

589
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:17,212
Wait till
midnight... and?

590
00:39:17,213 --> 00:39:18,213
We get
a virgin.

591
00:39:18,214 --> 00:39:19,548
A virgin?
Yeah.

592
00:39:19,549 --> 00:39:22,050
Okay, right.
Then what?

593
00:39:22,051 --> 00:39:24,286
Well, our virgin
takes the amulet,

594
00:39:24,287 --> 00:39:25,888
reads the magic spell
from the book,

595
00:39:25,889 --> 00:39:28,724
and, blamo, we blow
a hole in Limbo.

596
00:39:28,725 --> 00:39:29,892
That's so easy.

597
00:39:29,893 --> 00:39:31,627
Oh, a cinch.
Piece of cake.
Yeah.

598
00:39:35,732 --> 00:39:37,399
Rudy. Question.

599
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,400
Shoot.

600
00:39:38,401 --> 00:39:39,134
Know any virgins?

601
00:39:41,905 --> 00:39:43,705
Okay. Rudy, find
some silver bullets.

602
00:39:43,706 --> 00:39:45,974
And where the hell
am I supposed to find
silver bullets?

603
00:39:45,975 --> 00:39:48,076
K-Mart?
I don't know.
Gimme a break.

604
00:39:48,077 --> 00:39:50,112
Fat Kid, get a map.
Find Shadowbrook
Road.

605
00:39:50,113 --> 00:39:52,848
What, do I look
in the index for
"big, scary mansion"?

606
00:39:52,849 --> 00:39:53,849
Oh, you're a riot.

607
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:54,650
You guys!

608
00:39:58,354 --> 00:40:00,389
How can we trust
Scary German Guy?

609
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:02,524
Why would he lie
about a thing
like this?

610
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:03,759
Sean!

611
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:04,893
Phoebe,
have a life.
Okay?

612
00:40:04,894 --> 00:40:05,894
You're being
a spaz!

613
00:40:05,895 --> 00:40:07,396
Ow! God!

614
00:40:07,397 --> 00:40:08,397
You bit me,
you brat!

615
00:40:08,398 --> 00:40:09,965
I'm tellin'
Mom on you!

616
00:40:09,966 --> 00:40:11,633
Would ya look?

617
00:40:45,869 --> 00:40:47,369
It's okay,
you guys!

618
00:40:47,370 --> 00:40:49,238
He's friends
with us.

619
00:40:49,239 --> 00:40:51,707
Come on!
Don't be chickenshit!

620
00:40:55,245 --> 00:40:56,712
Come on.
I want to show you
my friends.

621
00:41:06,823 --> 00:41:07,990
Sean, no.

622
00:41:07,991 --> 00:41:10,058
Oh, go for it.

623
00:41:10,059 --> 00:41:11,560
Sean, are you crazy?

624
00:41:11,561 --> 00:41:13,028
That's a walkin'
dead guy.

625
00:41:13,029 --> 00:41:14,730
Sean, please don't die.

626
00:41:21,337 --> 00:41:23,238
Are... are you dead?

627
00:41:23,239 --> 00:41:24,640
D-Dead?

628
00:41:24,641 --> 00:41:26,508
Does Mom know
about him?

629
00:41:26,509 --> 00:41:28,110
No. Only us.

630
00:41:28,111 --> 00:41:30,245
Hey, guys,
get over here!
He's great!

631
00:41:34,851 --> 00:41:37,753
Now can I be
in the Monster Club?

632
00:41:40,023 --> 00:41:42,024
I can't believe it.

633
00:41:42,025 --> 00:41:44,159
Frankenstein's monster
in our clubhouse.

634
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,195
Let's ask him
to leave, okay?

635
00:41:46,196 --> 00:41:47,763
You're not still
scared, are you?

636
00:41:47,764 --> 00:41:50,065
Well, he is
a little bit
gross, Sean.

637
00:41:50,066 --> 00:41:50,766
Scr...

638
00:41:52,135 --> 00:41:53,535
Scra-aps.

639
00:41:53,536 --> 00:41:55,003
I taught him
to talk.

640
00:41:55,004 --> 00:41:56,271
Bo-gus.

641
00:41:58,174 --> 00:41:59,541
Give me...

642
00:41:59,542 --> 00:42:01,443
a... break.

643
00:42:01,444 --> 00:42:02,277
Huddle up, you guys.

644
00:42:05,215 --> 00:42:06,882
Sean, we gotta
get an adult.

645
00:42:06,883 --> 00:42:09,284
And your dad's a cop,
so if we get your dad...

646
00:42:09,285 --> 00:42:11,887
Absolutely no
grown-ups. Okay?

647
00:42:11,888 --> 00:42:13,555
They'll lock him up
in a cage or something.

648
00:42:13,556 --> 00:42:14,556
Dissect him.

649
00:42:14,557 --> 00:42:16,892
Or put him
on TV!
Fat Kid.

650
00:42:16,893 --> 00:42:18,861
Ha ha ha!
Why are you
such a lame-oid?

651
00:42:18,862 --> 00:42:20,128
You're the lame one.

652
00:42:21,164 --> 00:42:21,797
Bogus!

653
00:42:23,266 --> 00:42:24,299
Bogus.

654
00:42:25,468 --> 00:42:26,301
Dudes,
check it out.

655
00:42:54,264 --> 00:42:55,464
Sc...

656
00:42:55,465 --> 00:42:56,298
Scary?

657
00:43:33,636 --> 00:43:36,305
The amulet is in here.
Very near, yes.

658
00:43:36,306 --> 00:43:38,173
Oh... Van Helsing,

659
00:43:38,174 --> 00:43:40,008
your disciples
were very clumsy,

660
00:43:40,009 --> 00:43:42,978
trying to hide from me
the very thing
that is mine.

661
00:43:42,979 --> 00:43:44,847
No hiding,
never, from me.

662
00:43:48,651 --> 00:43:50,786
Ah! It's here!

663
00:44:07,971 --> 00:44:10,873
My prize.

664
00:44:14,344 --> 00:44:16,512
Soon, Van Helsing...

665
00:44:16,513 --> 00:44:19,381
soon, the creatures
of the night
shall rule the world.

666
00:44:20,950 --> 00:44:25,320
And there is
no one to stop us!

667
00:44:43,706 --> 00:44:45,207
<i># I don't wanna go home?</i>

668

<i># We ain't gonna let
this feelin' under?</i>

672
00:45:01,791 --> 00:45:05,294

and turn it up all the way?

673
00:45:05,295 --> 00:45:06,929
<i># Rock until you drop?</i>

<i># Ooh, yeah, rock?</i>

718
00:47:13,523 --> 00:47:16,558
I do regret
the dosage,
my friend.

719
00:47:20,697 --> 00:47:23,665
Most, um... lethal...

720
00:47:23,666 --> 00:47:25,067
by human standards.

721
00:47:26,703 --> 00:47:28,637
But then, um,

722
00:47:28,638 --> 00:47:31,406
human standards
do not apply, do they?

723
00:47:33,243 --> 00:47:36,345
Well, uh, I'll,
uh, go have a bite

724
00:47:36,346 --> 00:47:39,715
while you change
into something
more, um...

725
00:47:39,716 --> 00:47:40,582
comfortable.

726
00:48:26,763 --> 00:48:29,164
Last night,
near the ambulance
crash,

727
00:48:29,165 --> 00:48:31,200
get this...
eyewitness report:

728
00:48:31,201 --> 00:48:34,236
long black hearse.
No plates.

729
00:48:34,237 --> 00:48:35,404
You wanna ask me
about the hood
ornament?

730
00:48:35,405 --> 00:48:36,505
What about
the hood ornament?

731
00:48:36,506 --> 00:48:39,041
I thought
you'd never ask.

732
00:48:39,042 --> 00:48:40,642
A silver skull.

733
00:48:43,246 --> 00:48:44,580
I consider this
an exciting lead.

734
00:48:44,581 --> 00:48:46,748
I am excited.
Are you excited?
I'm thrilled.

735
00:48:46,749 --> 00:48:48,016
Put out an APB.

736
00:48:48,017 --> 00:48:49,218
I already did.

737
00:48:49,219 --> 00:48:50,152
I'm a very good
policeman.
You know?

738
00:48:57,827 --> 00:48:58,861
Crenshaw.

739
00:48:58,862 --> 00:49:00,229
Hurry!
Get all your men
and send them

740
00:49:00,230 --> 00:49:02,097
down to 666
Shadowbrook road!

741
00:49:02,098 --> 00:49:03,732
It's an old mansion!

742
00:49:03,733 --> 00:49:05,901
He's found the amulet!
There's... There's no time!

743
00:49:05,902 --> 00:49:07,336
Who the hell is this?

744
00:49:07,337 --> 00:49:09,137
<i>I'm the one
they shot last night!</i>

745
00:49:09,138 --> 00:49:10,138
I'm a werewolf
now, but...

746
00:49:10,139 --> 00:49:11,139
<i>Have a nice night.</i>

747
00:49:11,140 --> 00:49:13,342
No! No! No! No!
Don't hang up!

748
00:49:13,343 --> 00:49:16,879
Uhh! He's gonna kill
your son!

749
00:49:58,021 --> 00:49:59,755
Patrick!
Come in. Patrick.

750
00:49:59,756 --> 00:50:00,856
<i>Patrick,
come in.</i>

751
00:50:00,857 --> 00:50:02,691
Yeah, we're here.
Where are you?

752
00:50:02,692 --> 00:50:04,760
We're almost there.
Everything set with you?

753
00:50:04,761 --> 00:50:06,228
Know in a minute.
Rudy?

754
00:50:07,397 --> 00:50:07,930
Rudy!

755
00:50:09,399 --> 00:50:10,933
This babe is major.

756
00:50:13,369 --> 00:50:14,703
Rudy's in love.

757
00:50:14,704 --> 00:50:16,405
Well, good for Rudy.

758
00:50:18,641 --> 00:50:20,442
Thanks a lot, Pete.

759
00:50:28,985 --> 00:50:31,420
Okay, remember...
rendezvous position "A",

760
00:50:31,421 --> 00:50:33,088
2200 hours.

761
00:50:33,089 --> 00:50:34,456
<i>Say what?</i>

762
00:50:34,457 --> 00:50:35,824
10:00, doofus.

763
00:50:35,825 --> 00:50:37,759
<i>How do we know
the amulet's there,
anyway?</i>

764
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:39,328
We don't, but it's
all we have to go on.
Sean.

765
00:50:39,329 --> 00:50:41,163
<i>Okay. Well.
Good luck,
butt love.
Sean.</i>

766
00:50:41,164 --> 00:50:42,531
I know you are,
but what am I?
Sean.

767
00:50:42,532 --> 00:50:43,465
Out.

768
00:50:45,869 --> 00:50:47,035
What, Eugene?

769
00:50:47,036 --> 00:50:48,971
Creature
stole my Twinkie.

770
00:50:55,245 --> 00:50:55,978
So?

771
00:50:57,313 --> 00:50:58,480
What did you want
to ask me?

772
00:50:59,749 --> 00:51:02,251
What do we want
to ask you.

773
00:51:02,252 --> 00:51:06,054
Okay. Um, Sis...
me and Ru...

774
00:51:06,055 --> 00:51:07,356
Rudy?

775
00:51:07,357 --> 00:51:08,357
Your show, Ace.

776
00:51:08,358 --> 00:51:10,225
Okay.

777
00:51:10,226 --> 00:51:13,195
We just wanted
to know...

778
00:51:13,196 --> 00:51:14,997
if you're a virgin.
What?

779
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:20,936
Okay. What we want
to know is...

780
00:51:20,937 --> 00:51:22,204
are you a...

781
00:51:22,205 --> 00:51:23,005
Ahem. Look.

782
00:51:24,474 --> 00:51:25,474
What your brother

783
00:51:25,475 --> 00:51:28,143
is so delicately
attempting to inquire,

784
00:51:28,144 --> 00:51:31,180
and let me, out of my own
personal curiosity,

785
00:51:31,181 --> 00:51:33,115
is the degree to which
you may have or...

786
00:51:33,116 --> 00:51:36,018
have not,
at some point in time...

787
00:51:40,657 --> 00:51:41,523
...been dorked?

788
00:51:43,293 --> 00:51:45,227
You guys are sick!

789
00:51:46,563 --> 00:51:47,496
Guess what.

790
00:51:48,765 --> 00:51:51,099
Fox Photo's got
a two-for-one deal
this week,

791
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:53,468
and wouldn't you know it,
there's a space

792
00:51:53,469 --> 00:51:54,736
on the bulletin board

793
00:51:54,737 --> 00:51:57,639
right between
the prom committee notes...

794
00:51:57,640 --> 00:51:58,540
and the football roster.

795
00:52:07,517 --> 00:52:08,750
Sean.

796
00:52:08,751 --> 00:52:11,320
About this
Monster Squad thing.

797
00:52:11,321 --> 00:52:13,255
Maybe we could go
back to the clubhouse

798
00:52:13,256 --> 00:52:15,123
and rethink it
with the other guys.

799
00:52:15,124 --> 00:52:18,160
Fat Kid... you're
bein' a wuss.

800
00:52:18,161 --> 00:52:20,395
Wuss?

801
00:52:20,396 --> 00:52:21,430
Can it, Frank.

802
00:52:21,431 --> 00:52:23,065
Time's runnin' out.

803
00:52:24,167 --> 00:52:25,634
Sean, no!

804
00:52:25,635 --> 00:52:28,170
Scary house...
real monsters...

805
00:52:28,171 --> 00:52:31,340
us... 12 years old?
Remember?

806
00:52:31,341 --> 00:52:33,909
Midnight...
end of world.
Remember?

807
00:52:33,910 --> 00:52:36,578
Master... is near.

808
00:52:39,015 --> 00:52:41,583
Master wants
children dead.

809
00:52:55,431 --> 00:52:56,431
Um, Sean?

810
00:52:56,432 --> 00:52:58,167
Maybe we could be

811
00:52:58,168 --> 00:53:00,569
like Math Squad
instead, you know...

812
00:53:00,570 --> 00:53:02,871
do math problems.
Stay home.

813
00:53:02,872 --> 00:53:04,039
Or Nature Squad.

814
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:06,108
We could look at rocks,
collect birds.

815
00:53:06,109 --> 00:53:07,809
Not be dead. See,

816
00:53:07,810 --> 00:53:09,611
it's this whole death thing
I'm not crazy about.

817
00:53:49,752 --> 00:53:52,588
Well... no amulet.

818
00:53:52,589 --> 00:53:53,622
Let's go.

819
00:53:53,623 --> 00:53:56,258
Look. We got
two consolations.

820
00:53:56,259 --> 00:53:58,260
Number one,
Frankenstein's
on our side.

821
00:53:58,261 --> 00:54:00,529
And number two,
my dad's a cop.

822
00:54:00,530 --> 00:54:03,165
Anybody fools around with us,
he kicks their ass.

823
00:54:04,567 --> 00:54:05,167
Hey, Frankie.

824
00:54:06,503 --> 00:54:07,169
Come on.

825
00:54:26,723 --> 00:54:27,656
Frank!

826
00:54:31,394 --> 00:54:34,062
Wake up!
Wake up!

827
00:54:34,063 --> 00:54:35,631
Eugene, get
away from there!

828
00:54:35,632 --> 00:54:37,466
He won't wake up!

829
00:54:37,467 --> 00:54:39,902
Fat Kid, use your eyes.
Does it look like
you can help him?

830
00:54:39,903 --> 00:54:42,471
But... But what
do I do, Sean?

831
00:54:42,472 --> 00:54:43,705
A monster!

832
00:54:43,706 --> 00:54:44,940
Don't call him
a monster.

833
00:54:44,941 --> 00:54:46,975
Well... what
if he's dead?

834
00:54:46,976 --> 00:54:48,710
Then he died
to help us.

835
00:54:49,879 --> 00:54:50,913
Now, look.

836
00:54:50,914 --> 00:54:53,982
I'm the leader
of this squad,

837
00:54:53,983 --> 00:54:54,716
so listen up.

838
00:54:56,486 --> 00:54:59,154
He said Dracula
knows we're here.

839
00:54:59,155 --> 00:55:01,690
So let's just try
to find the amulet...

840
00:55:04,494 --> 00:55:05,727
...and get the hell
outta here.

841
00:55:08,498 --> 00:55:10,499
Sean!

842
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:11,934
Kick him
in the nards!
What?

843
00:55:11,935 --> 00:55:13,001
Kick him in the nards!

844
00:55:13,002 --> 00:55:15,237
He doesn't have nards!
Do it! Do it!

845
00:55:18,174 --> 00:55:19,975
Wolfman's got nards!

846
00:55:19,976 --> 00:55:21,844
Come on! Come on!

847
00:55:57,313 --> 00:55:59,448
<i>What are you doin'?
Haven't you read
The Hardy Boys?</i>

848
00:55:59,449 --> 00:56:01,884
You pull some lever down
and a secret door opens!

849
00:56:01,885 --> 00:56:04,186
You gotta
be kidding!
You have
a better idea?

850
00:56:15,498 --> 00:56:17,332
Come on, Sean.

851
00:56:17,333 --> 00:56:19,168
Damn!
Where is he?

852
00:56:19,169 --> 00:56:20,235
Where are you?
Come in!

853
00:56:21,938 --> 00:56:23,505
Sean!

854
00:56:23,506 --> 00:56:25,240
Where are you,
Sean?

855
00:56:26,676 --> 00:56:28,977
10:00.
They're late.

856
00:56:28,978 --> 00:56:31,046
Maybe the monsters
got them.

857
00:56:31,047 --> 00:56:33,749
"Maybe the monsters
got them."

858
00:56:42,926 --> 00:56:44,693
Can we go home, Sean?
Oh, great.

859
00:56:44,694 --> 00:56:47,529
Please? Can't we go home?
Just great.

860
00:56:47,530 --> 00:56:49,164
Frankenstein's dead,

861
00:56:49,165 --> 00:56:50,499
Eugene's whining,

862
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:52,301
and we're sitting here
with Pirate Bill.

863
00:56:52,302 --> 00:56:54,536
Come on, Sean.
Man, we're dead.

864
00:56:54,537 --> 00:56:55,270
Eugene, stop it.

865
00:57:02,045 --> 00:57:02,778
Bingo.

866
00:57:28,538 --> 00:57:29,304
You guys, I got it!

867
00:57:30,907 --> 00:57:32,441
Give it to me.

868
00:57:32,442 --> 00:57:33,809
Give it to me!

869
00:57:36,079 --> 00:57:39,214
Get out of here!
Get out of here!

870
00:57:39,215 --> 00:57:40,649
Help!

871
00:57:40,650 --> 00:57:41,650
Give it to me!

872
00:57:44,220 --> 00:57:47,322
Garlic! Come on!
Get outta here!

873
00:58:05,275 --> 00:58:06,275
You guys,

874
00:58:06,276 --> 00:58:09,278
we got Scary German Guy
to help us!

875
00:58:09,279 --> 00:58:11,213
The cavalry!
Thank Christ.

876
00:58:11,214 --> 00:58:12,714
Yeah, we figured
you guys were in trouble.

877
00:58:12,715 --> 00:58:14,716
It was boss!
I saw Dracula!

878
00:58:14,717 --> 00:58:17,252
And I kicked Wolfman in the nards...
Fat Kid, bag it. Okay?

879
00:58:17,253 --> 00:58:18,921
Is she a virgin?
Why don't you put it

880
00:58:18,922 --> 00:58:20,556
on the 6:00 news,
you little shit?

881
00:58:20,557 --> 00:58:21,557
Yeah, she is.

882
00:58:21,558 --> 00:58:22,891
Perhaps we should all

883
00:58:22,892 --> 00:58:24,827
go back to my place
for some pie.

884
00:58:26,529 --> 00:58:28,630
The book was right.

885
00:58:28,631 --> 00:58:31,133
Don't you see?
It's all true!

886
00:58:31,134 --> 00:58:34,069
We found the amulet,
but now there's monsters after us.

887
00:58:34,070 --> 00:58:36,738
We gotta go to a place
where there's a lot of people.

888
00:58:36,739 --> 00:58:37,773
Church.
What?

889
00:58:37,774 --> 00:58:39,274
Church!
He's right.

890
00:58:39,275 --> 00:58:41,143
There's an old church
in the town plaza.

891
00:58:41,144 --> 00:58:42,144
Perfect.

892
00:58:42,145 --> 00:58:43,345
Monsters hate religious stuff.

893
00:58:46,149 --> 00:58:47,149
Del.

894
00:58:47,150 --> 00:58:48,150
Del. Del!

895
00:58:48,151 --> 00:58:49,151
Look, I'm sorry.

896
00:58:49,152 --> 00:58:50,586
What, you
tryin' to tell me

897
00:58:50,587 --> 00:58:51,987
that we're gonna go
all the way out to Shadowbrook Road

898
00:58:51,988 --> 00:58:53,755
because you get
a call from some guy

899
00:58:53,756 --> 00:58:55,290
who tells you
he's a werewolf?

900
00:58:55,291 --> 00:58:57,493
Ha ha ha!
Ho ho!

901
00:58:57,494 --> 00:58:58,794
Look, I'm sorry.

902
00:58:58,795 --> 00:59:00,062
I guess it's feasible, Del.

903
00:59:00,063 --> 00:59:01,597
Listen to me.
Come on, man.

904
00:59:01,598 --> 00:59:04,199
I apologize. All right?
Ha ha ha!

905
00:59:09,405 --> 00:59:12,241
Look! It's 20 minutes
till midnight!

906
00:59:12,242 --> 00:59:14,443
We pull this off,
I'm gonna shit!

907
00:59:21,584 --> 00:59:22,584
Holy shit!

908
00:59:22,585 --> 00:59:23,886
Jesus Christ!

909
00:59:29,792 --> 00:59:31,493
Give me some slack!
What are you doing?

910
00:59:31,494 --> 00:59:33,862
Patrick, just give me some slack!
No!

911
00:59:33,863 --> 00:59:35,864
You're closer! Just give me some slack!
No way!

912
00:59:35,865 --> 00:59:37,032
Don't be a wuss!

913
00:59:37,033 --> 00:59:38,233
Okay!

914
00:59:55,818 --> 00:59:57,886
Come on! Hurry!

915
01:00:00,957 --> 01:00:03,025
Yes!
Come on! Let go! Let go!

916
01:00:03,026 --> 01:00:06,061
Let go of her! Let go!

917
01:00:06,062 --> 01:00:07,062
Go! Go!

918
01:00:07,063 --> 01:00:08,664
Go! Look at that!
It's dust!

919
01:00:08,665 --> 01:00:11,300
Come on! Yes! Come on!

920
01:00:11,301 --> 01:00:11,934
Go!

921
01:00:13,870 --> 01:00:16,371
See you later...
Band-Aid breath.

922
01:00:20,577 --> 01:00:22,144
Del, I don't know
if you're aware of this,

923
01:00:22,145 --> 01:00:24,012
but we're going
a hundred miles an hour!

924
01:00:24,013 --> 01:00:25,647
I notice little things
like that.

925
01:00:25,648 --> 01:00:27,416
I'm a very good policeman.
You know that?

926
01:00:47,270 --> 01:00:48,704
I'm not sayin'
anything.

927
01:00:48,705 --> 01:00:52,140
Not a single word.

928
01:00:52,141 --> 01:00:52,975
I appreciate that.

929
01:01:33,149 --> 01:01:34,516
Meeting adjourned.

930
01:01:46,930 --> 01:01:49,064
<i>Dispatch to Unit 28. Please respond.</i>

931
01:01:49,065 --> 01:01:50,032
Freeze!

932
01:01:51,634 --> 01:01:53,535
You move, and
I'll kill you!

933
01:01:56,506 --> 01:01:58,473
Dispatch, we got a 10-35.

934
01:01:58,474 --> 01:02:00,542
Send backup! Hurry it up!

935
01:02:01,678 --> 01:02:03,011
Del!
Get outta there!

936
01:02:11,921 --> 01:02:13,055
That's enough.

937
01:02:28,037 --> 01:02:29,571
I will have your son.

938
01:02:49,359 --> 01:02:50,092
Del?

939
01:02:51,361 --> 01:02:52,728
Del?

940
01:02:52,729 --> 01:02:54,696
D-Del, what's happening?

941
01:02:54,697 --> 01:02:55,697
What?

942
01:02:55,698 --> 01:02:56,598
The kids.

943
01:02:57,901 --> 01:02:58,901
Sean?

944
01:02:58,902 --> 01:03:00,068
Phoebe.

945
01:03:00,069 --> 01:03:01,737
Phoebe?

946
01:03:01,738 --> 01:03:02,604
Sean!

947
01:03:03,740 --> 01:03:04,606
Phoebe!

948
01:03:09,746 --> 01:03:11,246
Sean, can you hear me?

949
01:03:11,247 --> 01:03:12,114
Where are you?

950
01:03:13,583 --> 01:03:16,752
Sean! Can you hear me?
Where are you?

951
01:03:16,753 --> 01:03:19,454
<i>Dad! I'm here!
We're almost to Town Square.</i>

952
01:03:19,455 --> 01:03:20,122
<i>Hurry up!</i>

953
01:03:38,775 --> 01:03:40,342
Don't kick the church!
It's religious!

954
01:03:40,343 --> 01:03:41,777
It's locked
is what it is.

955
01:03:41,778 --> 01:03:42,778
Fine.

956
01:03:42,779 --> 01:03:43,645
Okay.

957
01:03:45,815 --> 01:03:47,249
We'll just have to
do it right here.

958
01:03:47,250 --> 01:03:48,951
Like, really
religious, Sean.

959
01:03:48,952 --> 01:03:51,286
Why don't we just
go over and do it in Burger King?

960
01:03:51,287 --> 01:03:53,021
You guys!

961
01:03:56,960 --> 01:03:58,227
Oh, shit!

962
01:03:58,228 --> 01:03:59,361
Patrick,
come on!

963
01:03:59,362 --> 01:04:00,863
Okay, come on, read the book.
Go!

964
01:04:00,864 --> 01:04:01,864
Okay!

Will you speak English?
I can't understand you!

979
01:04:43,006 --> 01:04:44,206
I don't believe this.

980

Please read!
Oh, shit!

981

My God.

Suck on this,
you son of a bitch.

986
01:06:06,322 --> 01:06:08,223
Hey, asshole.

987

You looked.

988
01:06:20,603 --> 01:06:21,303
It's okay.

989
01:06:38,555 --> 01:06:41,890
All right, let's try it again,
now, shall we?

990
01:06:41,891 --> 01:06:42,991
Look, you've
got me upset!

991
01:06:42,992 --> 01:06:44,326
Read it?
Come on, read!

992

Oh, my God!

993
01:07:03,213 --> 01:07:04,546
I said it!

994
01:07:04,547 --> 01:07:05,681
Ho ho!

Where's Limbo?

998
01:07:27,570 --> 01:07:29,171
We just went through
some major shit,

999
01:07:29,172 --> 01:07:30,606
and where's
the big Limbo thing?

1000
01:07:38,515 --> 01:07:40,649
Jesus... Christ!

1001
01:07:40,650 --> 01:07:42,684
Holy shit!
Kid, watch it!

1002
01:07:47,190 --> 01:07:48,290
Let's get him!
Let's go!

1003
01:07:50,527 --> 01:07:51,393
Go! Go!

1004

1006
01:07:57,033 --> 01:07:59,535
You're not a virgin,

1007
01:07:59,536 --> 01:08:01,303
No? No, what do you
mean, no?

1008
01:08:01,304 --> 01:08:03,972
Well... Steve, but
he doesn't count!

1009
01:08:03,973 --> 01:08:04,907
Doesn't count?

1010
01:08:28,531 --> 01:08:30,432
Bang.

1011
01:08:37,440 --> 01:08:38,440

Is she a vershion?

1017
01:09:03,266 --> 01:09:05,767
She? A virgin?

1018
01:09:05,768 --> 01:09:09,171
Yes! A virgin!
We'll use the girl!

1019
01:09:09,172 --> 01:09:11,173
She can't read!
She's five years old!

Don't look up.

Hey, sweetheart.

Where are
the monsters?

1066
01:16:06,122 --> 01:16:07,589
The mummy
came in my house.

1067
01:16:12,195 --> 01:16:15,097
Can somebody tell me what the
Sam Hell is goin' on around here?
