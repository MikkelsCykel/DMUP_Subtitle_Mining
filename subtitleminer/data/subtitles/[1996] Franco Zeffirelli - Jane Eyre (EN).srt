- You'll stay here untiI you learn!
- Let me out!

2
00:00:29,843 --> 00:00:33,119
- Your father died in this room.
- His ghost is still there.

3
00:00:33,363 --> 00:00:34,113
No!

4
00:00:34,523 --> 00:00:38,038
- You'll stay there till morning.
- Aunt, I can t endure it.

5
00:00:38,283 --> 00:00:40,035
You'll do as you re told.

6
00:03:28,563 --> 00:03:30,554
The Reverend Mr. Brocklehurst.

7
00:03:31,003 --> 00:03:31,719
John.

8
00:03:42,563 --> 00:03:44,554
Good afternoon,
Mr. Brocklehurst.

9
00:03:45,603 --> 00:03:46,718
Mrs. Reed.

10
00:03:48,243 --> 00:03:49,437
Do come this way.

11
00:03:55,603 --> 00:03:56,513
My chiIdren.

12
00:03:59,803 --> 00:04:00,758
Enchanting.

13
00:04:02,043 --> 00:04:04,796
- Tea?
- Perhaps just this once.

14
00:04:10,283 --> 00:04:11,921
Pray, be seated.

15
00:04:13,603 --> 00:04:14,922
John, dear,

16
00:04:15,363 --> 00:04:16,796
would you go and find that

17
00:04:17,043 --> 00:04:18,442
wretched girl?

18
00:04:18,683 --> 00:04:19,559
Yes, mama.

19
00:04:20,803 --> 00:04:22,236
This has been a very

20
00:04:22,683 --> 00:04:24,480
difficult decision.

21
00:04:24,723 --> 00:04:26,076
- Come on!
- She s going!

22
00:04:26,323 --> 00:04:29,679
- Hooray! She'll never like it.
- I can t believe it.

23
00:04:29,923 --> 00:04:31,561
<i>Her mother...</i>

24
00:04:32,243 --> 00:04:34,882
was my late husband s sister.

25
00:04:36,243 --> 00:04:38,837
She married a clergyman,
penniless.

26
00:04:39,043 --> 00:04:40,874
Then both parents died

27
00:04:41,243 --> 00:04:43,837
of typhus when she was
a fewmonths old.

28
00:04:44,043 --> 00:04:45,556
Are you her only relative?

29
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:47,721
<i>There is...</i>

30
00:04:48,283 --> 00:04:49,318
an uncle.

31
00:04:50,443 --> 00:04:51,558
Her father's brother.

32
00:04:51,843 --> 00:04:53,754
<i>But he Iives abroad in...</i>

33
00:04:54,323 --> 00:04:56,075
Madeira,
I knownothing of him.

34
00:04:58,363 --> 00:04:59,193
Go on.

35
00:05:01,803 --> 00:05:03,156
I have done what I can

36
00:05:03,563 --> 00:05:04,552
for the chiId,

37
00:05:04,803 --> 00:05:05,838
but she has a

38
00:05:07,003 --> 00:05:08,721
willful obstinate nature.

39
00:05:10,723 --> 00:05:11,951
Ah, here she is.

40
00:05:14,243 --> 00:05:15,722
This is Jane Eyre.

41
00:05:17,563 --> 00:05:20,760
Jane, Mr. Brocklehurst
of Lowood School.

42
00:05:21,963 --> 00:05:23,078
How do you do, sir?

43
00:05:23,763 --> 00:05:26,436
I hear you re a wicked child,
Jane Eyre.

44
00:05:27,843 --> 00:05:29,481
Let me examine you.

45
00:05:36,163 --> 00:05:38,518
Knowwhere
the wicked go after death?

46
00:05:40,563 --> 00:05:41,313
To Hell.

47
00:05:43,403 --> 00:05:45,075
What is Hell?

48
00:05:45,523 --> 00:05:47,081
Can you tell me that?

49
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:50,202
A pit full of fire.

50
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:54,232
And should you like to fall
into that pit and

51
00:05:54,443 --> 00:05:56,399
and to burn there forever?

52
00:05:57,403 --> 00:05:58,313
No, sir.

53
00:05:58,843 --> 00:05:59,912
What must you do

54
00:06:00,203 --> 00:06:01,238
to avoid it?

55
00:06:03,243 --> 00:06:04,642
Keep well and not die.

56
00:06:06,483 --> 00:06:07,711
It is as I said.

57
00:06:08,323 --> 00:06:10,439
You must warn herteachers

58
00:06:11,283 --> 00:06:13,035
to keep an eye on her,

59
00:06:14,323 --> 00:06:17,156
and to guard
against her worst fault,

60
00:06:18,363 --> 00:06:19,796
hertendency to deceit.

61
00:06:21,243 --> 00:06:22,278
Deceit?

62
00:06:23,403 --> 00:06:26,076
We do not tolerate that
at Lowood.

63
00:06:26,323 --> 00:06:27,995
That's why I wrote to you.

64
00:06:29,483 --> 00:06:31,792
I want her to be
brought up in a manner

65
00:06:32,003 --> 00:06:33,356
befitting her prospects.

66
00:06:33,843 --> 00:06:35,435
To be made useful,

67
00:06:35,843 --> 00:06:37,356
to be kept humble.

68
00:06:37,883 --> 00:06:41,034
<i>And... As for the vacations...</i>

69
00:06:44,043 --> 00:06:45,362
<i>I would prefer...</i>

70
00:06:46,043 --> 00:06:47,715
if she spent them...

71
00:06:48,363 --> 00:06:49,239
with you.

72
00:06:49,763 --> 00:06:50,593
Of course.

73
00:06:53,243 --> 00:06:54,073
Come.

74
00:06:56,683 --> 00:06:58,480
Deceit is a sin.

75
00:06:58,923 --> 00:07:00,800
It is akin to falsehood.

76
00:07:01,243 --> 00:07:04,952
And all liars shall
spend eternity in that lake,

77
00:07:05,203 --> 00:07:07,398
burning with
brimstone and fire.

78
00:07:08,363 --> 00:07:11,082
- I m not deceitful.
- I beg your pardon?

79
00:07:11,923 --> 00:07:13,436
I'm not deceitful,

80
00:07:14,003 --> 00:07:15,482
and I m not a liar.

81
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:18,881
If I were,
I should say I loved you.

82
00:07:20,163 --> 00:07:21,596
I do not love you,

83
00:07:21,843 --> 00:07:24,562
I dislike you worst of anybody
in the world...

84
00:07:24,763 --> 00:07:25,434
except your son.

85
00:07:25,643 --> 00:07:27,201
Your bags, Jane Eyre.

86
00:07:32,763 --> 00:07:33,878
Did you see

87
00:07:34,683 --> 00:07:36,196
what a wicked child she is?

88
00:07:36,803 --> 00:07:38,919
Have no fear, Mrs. Reed,

89
00:07:39,163 --> 00:07:41,961
at Lowood we shall
tame her unruly spirit.

90
00:08:32,643 --> 00:08:33,553
The stool.

91
00:08:36,363 --> 00:08:37,478
Place her upon it.

92
00:08:45,683 --> 00:08:46,672
You see this...

93
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:49,195
this girl?

94
00:08:52,923 --> 00:08:55,312
Her name isJane Eyre.

95
00:08:56,603 --> 00:08:58,434
Be on your guard
against her.

96
00:08:59,403 --> 00:09:00,472
Avoid her company.

97
00:09:02,243 --> 00:09:04,359
Shut her out
of your conversations.

98
00:09:05,443 --> 00:09:07,957
This girl,
take a good look at her,

99
00:09:08,523 --> 00:09:10,161
this girl is a liar.

100
00:09:12,123 --> 00:09:14,034
Let her stand there all day.

101
00:09:14,723 --> 00:09:16,156
She shall have no food.

102
00:09:16,843 --> 00:09:19,755
And let no one speak to her.

103
00:09:28,923 --> 00:09:29,753
Alice.

104
00:09:30,603 --> 00:09:31,718
Pay attention.

105
00:09:33,563 --> 00:09:34,962
Back to your lessons.

106
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:45,115
Forgive me, Lord,

107
00:09:45,323 --> 00:09:48,042
for Thy dear son,

108
00:09:48,283 --> 00:09:53,437
the ill that I this day
have done.

109
00:09:53,723 --> 00:09:56,191
That with the world,

110
00:09:56,403 --> 00:09:57,313
myself

111
00:09:57,603 --> 00:09:59,116
and Thee,

112
00:09:59,323 --> 00:10:01,962
I, here I sleep,

113
00:10:02,203 --> 00:10:05,161
at peace may be.

114
00:10:05,683 --> 00:10:06,877
Let her sing.

115
00:10:08,803 --> 00:10:13,797
O may my soul
on Thee repose,

116
00:10:14,923 --> 00:10:17,437
and with sweet sleep

117
00:10:17,643 --> 00:10:20,157
mine eyelids close.

118
00:10:20,363 --> 00:10:23,082
Sleep that may me

119
00:10:23,323 --> 00:10:25,712
more vigorous make

120
00:10:26,003 --> 00:10:28,358
to serve my God

121
00:10:28,563 --> 00:10:32,476
when I awake.

122
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:46,274
Jane.

123
00:10:50,363 --> 00:10:51,273
What?

124
00:10:54,723 --> 00:10:56,395
Some bread and cheese.

125
00:10:57,123 --> 00:10:58,033
Thank you.

126
00:11:05,363 --> 00:11:06,352
What s your name?

127
00:11:07,243 --> 00:11:08,278
Helen Burns.

128
00:11:09,443 --> 00:11:11,115
Thank you, Helen.
God bless you.

129
00:11:13,163 --> 00:11:14,642
And you too, Jane.

130
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:18,353
Goodnight.

131
00:11:42,203 --> 00:11:43,192
Hands...

132
00:11:44,803 --> 00:11:45,713
<i>Bonnet...</i>

133
00:11:46,283 --> 00:11:47,159
Shoes.

134
00:11:49,123 --> 00:11:49,953
Hands.

135
00:11:50,963 --> 00:11:51,520
Bonnet.

136
00:11:51,723 --> 00:11:52,951
Bonnet, Jones!

137
00:11:56,323 --> 00:11:57,517
Burns, you re on the side

138
00:11:57,723 --> 00:11:58,838
your shoe.
Your toes out.

139
00:12:02,403 --> 00:12:03,597
Your chin is poking out.

140
00:12:04,523 --> 00:12:05,558
Your head up!

141
00:12:06,003 --> 00:12:08,358
I will not have
you so slovenly.

142
00:12:09,323 --> 00:12:10,676
Cover your mouth!

143
00:12:13,163 --> 00:12:15,313
Dirty, disagreeable girl.

144
00:12:16,003 --> 00:12:17,675
You haven t cleaned
your naiIs.

145
00:12:18,163 --> 00:12:19,482
The water was frozen.

146
00:12:19,683 --> 00:12:21,162
That is no excuse.

147
00:12:24,403 --> 00:12:25,392
Fetch me the birch.

148
00:12:30,443 --> 00:12:31,876
Obstinate girl.

149
00:12:34,483 --> 00:12:36,394
Nothing will cure you

150
00:12:36,603 --> 00:12:37,194
of your

151
00:12:37,403 --> 00:12:39,234
slatternly habits.

152
00:12:39,643 --> 00:12:41,235
Sorry, Miss Scatcherd.

153
00:12:42,403 --> 00:12:43,472
Put it away.

154
00:12:45,523 --> 00:12:46,638
Cleanliness...

155
00:12:47,323 --> 00:12:49,075
is next to Godliness.

156
00:12:52,363 --> 00:12:53,921
Time for your lessons.

157
00:12:58,403 --> 00:13:01,759
- You destroyed our day now!
- No one likes you.

158
00:13:02,843 --> 00:13:05,152
Go sit down,
I'll see you in a minute.

159
00:13:17,043 --> 00:13:19,955
- Who taught you to draw?
- I taught myself.

160
00:13:20,203 --> 00:13:22,398
I used to look at
my Aunt s books

161
00:13:22,603 --> 00:13:24,400
and copy the pictures.

162
00:13:24,603 --> 00:13:26,958
- You drawvery well.
- Not really.

163
00:13:27,203 --> 00:13:29,512
You do. You have a gift.
You re lucky.

164
00:13:33,203 --> 00:13:33,919
Helen.

165
00:13:35,283 --> 00:13:38,036
- Can I drawa portrait of you?
- Me?

166
00:13:39,843 --> 00:13:40,832
Yes.

167
00:13:41,843 --> 00:13:44,516
Take off your bonnet,
you have pretty hair.

168
00:14:17,763 --> 00:14:20,516
...seem fit to
burden us once more.

169
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:23,959
Who s that girl

170
00:14:24,203 --> 00:14:25,272
with red hair?

171
00:14:26,283 --> 00:14:28,194
Burns, sir. Helen Burns.

172
00:14:37,203 --> 00:14:38,602
Burns, step forward.

173
00:14:46,683 --> 00:14:47,798
Vanity.

174
00:14:48,723 --> 00:14:50,202
You see this vanity?

175
00:14:50,443 --> 00:14:53,116
Long curled hair,
masses of red curls.

176
00:14:53,723 --> 00:14:55,793
In defiance of our principles.

177
00:14:56,043 --> 00:14:57,112
You knowthat.

178
00:14:57,323 --> 00:14:58,881
It was my fault, sir.

179
00:14:59,123 --> 00:15:00,522
I told her to take it off.

180
00:15:00,723 --> 00:15:03,635
It s not her bonnet.
It s her hair, her vanity.

181
00:15:03,843 --> 00:15:06,676
It's not vanity, Mr. Brocklehurst.
Helen s

182
00:15:06,923 --> 00:15:08,322
hair curls naturally.

183
00:15:08,523 --> 00:15:11,720
And does she not sin
naturally as well?

184
00:15:12,723 --> 00:15:14,042
I teach you discipline.

185
00:15:14,523 --> 00:15:17,321
I am here to correct nature,
Miss Temple.

186
00:15:17,523 --> 00:15:19,991
I'll arrange it so
it doesn t offend you.

187
00:15:20,283 --> 00:15:23,355
Offending me is not the issue.
The chiId s

188
00:15:23,563 --> 00:15:25,474
vanity must be suppressed.

189
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:28,438
Remove far from me

190
00:15:28,723 --> 00:15:30,315
vanity and Iies.

191
00:15:31,363 --> 00:15:32,842
Proverbs.
Chapter 30, verse8.

192
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:36,992
- Her hair shall be cut off.
- No!

193
00:15:39,963 --> 00:15:42,113
Did someone speak?

194
00:15:42,323 --> 00:15:45,076
You'd punish her for the way
God made her?

195
00:15:48,323 --> 00:15:49,517
Fetch the scissors.

196
00:15:53,323 --> 00:15:54,756
You, Jane Eyre.

197
00:16:01,723 --> 00:16:02,712
Did you hear?

198
00:16:05,683 --> 00:16:07,992
I will not ask you again.

199
00:16:59,563 --> 00:17:01,758
Your hair will
grow again soon.

200
00:17:05,203 --> 00:17:08,081
And if it is cut again,
it will grow again.

201
00:17:09,843 --> 00:17:12,232
And it will be
more beautiful than before.

202
00:17:18,243 --> 00:17:19,517
Come, into bed.

203
00:17:28,363 --> 00:17:31,036
I'm sure you feel
sorry for yourselves.

204
00:17:33,163 --> 00:17:34,357
I m sure you all

205
00:17:34,563 --> 00:17:38,078
envy other girls who seem
to be blessed with happier lives.

206
00:17:39,243 --> 00:17:40,392
But you...

207
00:17:40,643 --> 00:17:43,555
have all been blessed
with intelligence.

208
00:17:45,203 --> 00:17:47,922
Intelligence
and a proper education

209
00:17:48,163 --> 00:17:51,155
will give you independence
of spirit,

210
00:17:51,803 --> 00:17:53,680
the greatest blessing of all.

211
00:17:55,603 --> 00:17:57,673
The only thing that matters

212
00:17:57,923 --> 00:17:59,914
is to be in harmony
with God.

213
00:18:01,043 --> 00:18:02,795
- What is this?
- Come, into bed.

214
00:18:04,043 --> 00:18:05,112
Go to bed!

215
00:18:06,003 --> 00:18:07,516
Lmmediately!
All of you!

216
00:18:07,723 --> 00:18:08,633
Miss Temple!

217
00:18:16,283 --> 00:18:18,399
I m worried about Helen Burns.

218
00:18:18,683 --> 00:18:21,800
- Hercough is worse.
- Most of them have a cough.

219
00:18:22,123 --> 00:18:23,920
We should call the doctor.

220
00:18:26,323 --> 00:18:28,359
Only Mr. Brocklehurst
can do that.

221
00:18:29,123 --> 00:18:31,114
Then I shall talk with him.

222
00:18:31,643 --> 00:18:33,201
No, Miss Temple.
I will.

223
00:19:54,323 --> 00:19:54,994
Helen?

224
00:19:57,683 --> 00:19:58,479
Jane?

225
00:20:00,363 --> 00:20:01,478
Is that you?

226
00:20:05,603 --> 00:20:07,116
What are you doing here?

227
00:20:07,763 --> 00:20:08,798
Lt's gone eleven.

228
00:20:10,003 --> 00:20:11,959
I couldnt sleep
till I d seen you.

229
00:20:15,763 --> 00:20:16,832
Your feet are bare.

230
00:20:18,683 --> 00:20:19,718
Lie down.

231
00:20:20,523 --> 00:20:23,117
Cover yourself
with my quilt.

232
00:20:37,123 --> 00:20:38,272
Don t cry.

233
00:20:39,443 --> 00:20:40,762
You mustn't cry.

234
00:20:41,483 --> 00:20:43,155
Please dont leave me.

235
00:20:46,123 --> 00:20:47,795
We'll be together again.

236
00:20:49,243 --> 00:20:49,834
When?

237
00:20:50,203 --> 00:20:50,953
Where?

238
00:20:53,563 --> 00:20:54,632
In Heaven...

239
00:20:55,363 --> 00:20:56,352
forever.

240
00:20:57,003 --> 00:20:58,038
Will we?

241
00:20:59,603 --> 00:21:02,675
- Don t you believe that?
- I dont know.

242
00:21:05,923 --> 00:21:09,074
You must believe it, Jane.
You must believe...

243
00:21:09,483 --> 00:21:11,474
God will take care of us.

244
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:17,072
Goodnight,

245
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:18,842
dearest Jane.

246
00:21:49,163 --> 00:21:50,232
Mr. Brocklehurst.

247
00:21:51,043 --> 00:21:52,271
Mr. Brocklehurst.

248
00:21:53,563 --> 00:21:54,996
I've found her, sir.

249
00:22:01,243 --> 00:22:02,073
Burns.

250
00:22:03,603 --> 00:22:04,160
Burns.

251
00:22:14,403 --> 00:22:15,438
I'll tend to it.

252
00:22:27,803 --> 00:22:29,475
Dont grieve, Jane.

253
00:22:31,003 --> 00:22:32,880
She s gone to a better place.

254
00:22:35,003 --> 00:22:36,641
May God have mercy
on her soul.

255
00:22:38,363 --> 00:22:39,318
Come, Jane.

256
00:23:36,563 --> 00:23:37,313
Jane.

257
00:23:37,843 --> 00:23:39,640
Hurry, the coach is here.

258
00:23:48,323 --> 00:23:50,598
I hope you don t think
I m ungrateful.

259
00:23:50,803 --> 00:23:52,794
Ungrateful,
what do you mean?

260
00:23:53,283 --> 00:23:56,514
Since I've come to Lowood,
you ve been my one friend.

261
00:23:56,723 --> 00:23:57,872
Apart from Helen.

262
00:23:58,683 --> 00:24:01,277
- I feel I m abandoning you.
- No, no.

263
00:24:02,203 --> 00:24:03,636
You mustn t think that.

264
00:24:04,603 --> 00:24:05,752
No. It s good

265
00:24:06,083 --> 00:24:08,597
and proper for you
to start a newlife.

266
00:24:10,043 --> 00:24:11,556
I wish you could come.

267
00:24:12,603 --> 00:24:13,558
Thank you.

268
00:24:16,523 --> 00:24:17,273
But...

269
00:24:17,963 --> 00:24:20,318
I believe it s God s will
I m here.

270
00:24:21,483 --> 00:24:22,518
I cannot leave.

271
00:24:31,443 --> 00:24:32,273
God bless you.

272
00:24:45,643 --> 00:24:48,316
- Howmuch further?
- About 20 miles.

273
00:24:49,083 --> 00:24:50,198
Oh, I see.

274
00:24:56,963 --> 00:24:58,191
If Miss Eyre,

275
00:24:58,403 --> 00:25:01,759
who advertised in the Yorkshire
Herald last Thursday,

276
00:25:02,123 --> 00:25:03,636
is in a position to give

277
00:25:03,843 --> 00:25:05,435
satisfactory references

278
00:25:05,643 --> 00:25:08,077
as to character
and competency,

279
00:25:08,283 --> 00:25:10,797
a situation can be
offered to her.

280
00:25:11,283 --> 00:25:13,080
There is but one pupil,

281
00:25:13,283 --> 00:25:15,922
a little girl
under ten years of age.

282
00:25:16,283 --> 00:25:19,036
The salary is30 pounds
per annum.

283
00:25:19,523 --> 00:25:21,115
Miss Eyre is requested

284
00:25:21,323 --> 00:25:24,554
to send references, name,
address

285
00:25:24,763 --> 00:25:28,551
and all particulars
to Mrs. Fairfax, Thornfield Hall.

286
00:25:41,363 --> 00:25:44,196
It'll be nice
to get out and stretch.

287
00:25:44,403 --> 00:25:45,722
- Goodbye, Miss.
- Goodbye.

288
00:25:45,963 --> 00:25:47,112
Goodbye, young lass.

289
00:26:11,323 --> 00:26:12,438
Come in, Miss.

290
00:26:17,043 --> 00:26:17,759
Come in.

291
00:26:21,123 --> 00:26:21,839
Leah!

292
00:26:22,443 --> 00:26:24,115
It s the new Governess.

293
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:40,321
Would you follow me, Miss?

294
00:26:44,963 --> 00:26:46,112
Mrs. Fairfax.

295
00:26:48,243 --> 00:26:49,232
Mrs. Fairfax.

296
00:26:49,723 --> 00:26:50,553
Miss Eyre.

297
00:26:53,923 --> 00:26:55,515
How do you do, my dear?

298
00:26:56,163 --> 00:26:58,882
It s a tedious journey.
You must be frozen.

299
00:26:59,483 --> 00:27:00,598
Let me help you.

300
00:27:01,843 --> 00:27:03,834
- Don t trouble yourself.
- No trouble.

301
00:27:04,243 --> 00:27:07,838
Your hands must be numb with cold.
Come to the fire

302
00:27:08,243 --> 00:27:09,358
and get warm.

303
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:11,595
There.
And I dare say

304
00:27:11,803 --> 00:27:14,192
a hot drink would be
most welcome too.

305
00:27:14,403 --> 00:27:15,518
- Sugar?
- No, thank you.

306
00:27:15,763 --> 00:27:17,401
Leah, cut a sandwich ortwo.

307
00:27:18,323 --> 00:27:19,836
- Do sit down.
- Thank you.

308
00:27:20,083 --> 00:27:20,799
The key.

309
00:27:21,043 --> 00:27:23,398
- What?
- The key, Mrs. Fairfax.

310
00:27:26,363 --> 00:27:27,113
Here.

311
00:27:27,763 --> 00:27:30,914
If Adele is still awake,
ask her to come down.

312
00:27:31,203 --> 00:27:32,431
Yes, Mrs. Fairfax.

313
00:27:33,283 --> 00:27:36,434
The chiId keeps
the most impossible hours.

314
00:27:36,803 --> 00:27:37,838
Her mother

315
00:27:38,363 --> 00:27:40,718
must have kept her up
the entire evening.

316
00:27:40,963 --> 00:27:42,032
She isn t your daughter?

317
00:27:42,963 --> 00:27:44,840
Oh, no, no.

318
00:27:45,443 --> 00:27:47,673
No, her name is Varens...
Adele

319
00:27:47,923 --> 00:27:48,594
Varens.

320
00:27:48,803 --> 00:27:50,521
No, I have no family.

321
00:27:54,163 --> 00:27:56,882
I am glad, I m so glad

322
00:27:57,123 --> 00:27:58,192
you are come.

323
00:27:59,203 --> 00:28:02,832
One can feel so isolated here,
especially in the winter.

324
00:28:03,523 --> 00:28:07,482
It will be most pleasant for me
to have someone to converse with

325
00:28:07,683 --> 00:28:09,275
on terms of equality.

326
00:28:10,243 --> 00:28:11,596
Of course to be sure,

327
00:28:11,923 --> 00:28:15,757
John and his wife Leah
are very decent people...

328
00:28:16,643 --> 00:28:18,679
Here is yourcharge.

329
00:28:19,763 --> 00:28:20,832
Come, Adele.

330
00:28:22,243 --> 00:28:23,801
This lady will teach you

331
00:28:24,043 --> 00:28:26,113
and make a clever woman
of you.

332
00:28:27,603 --> 00:28:28,558
My governess?

333
00:28:29,083 --> 00:28:32,041
That s right.
You may call me Miss Eyre.

334
00:28:32,243 --> 00:28:34,837
You speak French!
May we speak in French?

335
00:28:35,083 --> 00:28:38,075
Yes, Adele, but we re
with Mrs. Fairfax now,

336
00:28:38,283 --> 00:28:41,559
it is more polite
if we speak in English.

337
00:28:41,763 --> 00:28:42,593
You understand

338
00:28:42,803 --> 00:28:44,156
when she runs on like that?

339
00:28:44,563 --> 00:28:45,439
Oh yes.

340
00:28:45,843 --> 00:28:48,232
Shall I sing?
My mama taught be to sing.

341
00:28:48,603 --> 00:28:49,513
Where is your mama?

342
00:28:50,283 --> 00:28:51,955
Gone. She flew away

343
00:28:52,203 --> 00:28:53,477
to the Holy Virgin.

344
00:28:53,923 --> 00:28:55,402
She taught me
to dance and sing.

345
00:28:55,603 --> 00:28:57,082
Shall I sing for you?

346
00:28:57,643 --> 00:28:59,281
In the morning, Adele.

347
00:28:59,603 --> 00:29:00,558
It s late.

348
00:29:01,243 --> 00:29:04,474
And it is time you were in bed.
Come along.

349
00:29:05,843 --> 00:29:08,277
We shall come up
and hear your prayers.

350
00:29:10,323 --> 00:29:11,597
This way, my dear.

351
00:29:19,523 --> 00:29:20,433
Come on, Miss.

352
00:29:22,243 --> 00:29:25,792
Thornfield is a fine old hall,
perhaps a little neglected,

353
00:29:26,043 --> 00:29:29,319
but that could be remedied
if Mr. Rochester would come.

354
00:29:30,043 --> 00:29:31,556
Who is Mr. Rochester?

355
00:29:31,843 --> 00:29:35,199
Why, he is the Master
ofthis house.

356
00:29:35,403 --> 00:29:38,042
But you won't see him.
He never stops here.

357
00:29:38,243 --> 00:29:39,835
Of course he does,
sometimes.

358
00:29:40,083 --> 00:29:42,199
He brought you here,
didnt he?

359
00:29:42,963 --> 00:29:45,079
But it is true,
he s usually away.

360
00:29:45,563 --> 00:29:46,393
Miss.

361
00:29:48,923 --> 00:29:50,197
Will we be very happy?

362
00:29:51,763 --> 00:29:54,197
We shall work hard
and be content.

363
00:29:55,163 --> 00:29:58,951
- Goodnight, Adele. Say your prayers.
- Goodnight, Miss Eyre.

364
00:30:00,323 --> 00:30:01,836
Goodnight, Mrs. Fairfax.

365
00:30:03,003 --> 00:30:04,072
Goodnight, Adele.

366
00:30:08,443 --> 00:30:10,434
I'll not keep you up all night.

367
00:30:10,643 --> 00:30:12,952
I m sure you'll want
to retire early.

368
00:30:13,203 --> 00:30:16,752
And your room is just along here
near to Adele.

369
00:30:17,043 --> 00:30:19,796
It s small, but I thought
you d Iike it better

370
00:30:20,043 --> 00:30:21,556
than the ones in front.

371
00:30:22,843 --> 00:30:26,836
They re larger, but so solitary.
No one ever sleeps there.

372
00:30:28,003 --> 00:30:29,197
One would almost say

373
00:30:29,443 --> 00:30:33,152
if there was a ghost at Thornfield,
that would be its haunt.

374
00:30:34,483 --> 00:30:36,155
Now, here is your room.

375
00:30:43,243 --> 00:30:44,437
This is for me?

376
00:30:45,483 --> 00:30:47,155
Why, is anything the matter?

377
00:30:48,483 --> 00:30:50,872
Tomorrow I'll discover
this is a dream

378
00:30:51,123 --> 00:30:52,681
from which I must awaken.

379
00:30:55,563 --> 00:30:57,076
We are real,

380
00:30:57,483 --> 00:31:00,873
and you are most welcome here,
most welcome.

381
00:31:01,123 --> 00:31:04,513
- Goodnight. Sleep well.
- Thank you, Mrs. Fairfax.

382
00:31:25,763 --> 00:31:26,752
Up here

383
00:31:27,243 --> 00:31:28,835
is the main gallery.

384
00:31:31,083 --> 00:31:32,721
What a handsome place.

385
00:31:33,243 --> 00:31:35,962
I had the windows opened
to let in the air.

386
00:31:36,203 --> 00:31:36,919
Everything gets

387
00:31:37,163 --> 00:31:39,836
so damp in rooms
that are seldom entered.

388
00:31:40,443 --> 00:31:43,003
Let me show you
the rest of the house.

389
00:31:49,123 --> 00:31:51,762
Here are the Master s rooms.

390
00:32:04,763 --> 00:32:06,355
Is that Mr. Rochester?

391
00:32:06,643 --> 00:32:07,598
Oh, no.

392
00:32:08,363 --> 00:32:09,398
His father.

393
00:32:09,603 --> 00:32:13,039
Why Mr. Rochester keeps it
here despite everything,

394
00:32:13,283 --> 00:32:15,922
I do not know.
One of his strange ways.

395
00:32:18,563 --> 00:32:21,236
His father and his brother

396
00:32:22,203 --> 00:32:24,398
were very unfair to him.

397
00:32:27,403 --> 00:32:28,631
Some would say barbarous.

398
00:32:29,483 --> 00:32:31,599
He was the youngest son,
you see.

399
00:32:31,803 --> 00:32:33,316
And he was expected

400
00:32:33,523 --> 00:32:36,162
to sacrifice everything
for the family.

401
00:32:38,843 --> 00:32:43,121
He only inherited Thornfield
nine years ago.

402
00:32:49,803 --> 00:32:52,681
When he was a chiId,
he was a gentle boy.

403
00:32:53,283 --> 00:32:56,753
He s clearly not barbarous
if he s taking care of Adele.

404
00:32:57,123 --> 00:32:58,112
Oh, no.

405
00:32:58,723 --> 00:33:01,920
No, Mr. Rochester does accept
his responsibiIities.

406
00:33:02,443 --> 00:33:06,072
Hes a just and liberal
landlord to his tenants.

407
00:33:06,283 --> 00:33:08,672
He s well travelled

408
00:33:08,923 --> 00:33:10,720
and very intelligent.

409
00:33:12,003 --> 00:33:15,040
But when he talks to you,
you can t be sure

410
00:33:15,363 --> 00:33:17,752
whether he is in jest
or in earnest.

411
00:33:18,523 --> 00:33:21,321
Whether he is pleased
or the contrary.

412
00:33:26,163 --> 00:33:28,154
He is not a happy man.

413
00:33:30,523 --> 00:33:32,991
Oh my goodness, those flowers!

414
00:33:33,203 --> 00:33:36,957
I keep telling Leah that all the
rooms must be kept in readiness.

415
00:33:37,243 --> 00:33:39,677
Mr. Rochester s visits
may be rare,

416
00:33:39,923 --> 00:33:41,436
but we re never warned.

417
00:34:00,963 --> 00:34:02,078
What was that?

418
00:34:03,683 --> 00:34:06,914
One of the servants most Iikely,
Grace Poole.

419
00:34:07,123 --> 00:34:08,033
Did you hear it?

420
00:34:08,283 --> 00:34:09,238
Oh, yes.

421
00:34:09,963 --> 00:34:11,919
I often hear it.

422
00:34:13,523 --> 00:34:16,913
She does sewing in
one of these rooms.

423
00:34:19,283 --> 00:34:19,954
Grace!

424
00:34:23,803 --> 00:34:24,952
Too much noise!

425
00:34:26,283 --> 00:34:27,841
Remember instructions.

426
00:34:32,363 --> 00:34:33,591
We can go back this way.

427
00:35:12,283 --> 00:35:14,558
Your arithmetic
is not very good, Adele.

428
00:35:14,763 --> 00:35:17,231
It s dull.
I don t care for it.

429
00:35:18,243 --> 00:35:22,202
- Cant we do something else?
- I m here to give you an education.

430
00:35:22,643 --> 00:35:25,396
Arithmetic is
an important part of that.

431
00:35:26,043 --> 00:35:28,921
Mama said it was important
to sing and dance.

432
00:35:29,123 --> 00:35:30,078
That wasn t dull.

433
00:35:31,043 --> 00:35:33,876
If you re good,
I'll teach you the piano.

434
00:35:34,803 --> 00:35:35,679
Will you?

435
00:35:36,203 --> 00:35:38,159
- When?
- Perhaps tomorrow.

436
00:35:38,363 --> 00:35:41,992
- Why not now?
- Arithmetic today, piano tomorrow.

437
00:35:43,403 --> 00:35:46,361
I m going for a walk,
and when I come back,

438
00:35:46,683 --> 00:35:49,914
I want to see how many
of those sums

439
00:35:50,723 --> 00:35:51,838
you ve got right.

440
00:35:53,923 --> 00:35:57,711
- But they re so difficult.
- You can do it, I know you can.

441
00:37:12,283 --> 00:37:13,272
Are you injured?

442
00:37:19,603 --> 00:37:20,592
Can I do anything?

443
00:37:24,123 --> 00:37:25,795
You can stand to one side.

444
00:37:37,763 --> 00:37:39,879
If you re hurt,
I'll fetch help.

445
00:37:40,443 --> 00:37:43,116
Thank you.
I have no broken bones.

446
00:37:47,443 --> 00:37:48,398
Go on then.

447
00:37:50,123 --> 00:37:54,082
I cannot leave you here until
you re able to mount your horse.

448
00:37:55,483 --> 00:37:56,677
You should be at home.

449
00:37:58,123 --> 00:37:59,158
Where do you come from?

450
00:38:00,203 --> 00:38:00,999
There.

451
00:38:02,603 --> 00:38:04,241
That house
with the battlements?

452
00:38:04,763 --> 00:38:05,673
Yes, sir.

453
00:38:08,403 --> 00:38:09,472
Whose house is it?

454
00:38:09,963 --> 00:38:10,952
Mr. Rochester s.

455
00:38:13,363 --> 00:38:15,035
Do you know Mr. Rochester?

456
00:38:16,483 --> 00:38:17,916
I ve never seen him.

457
00:38:19,243 --> 00:38:20,801
What is your position?

458
00:38:21,523 --> 00:38:22,717
I mthe Governess.

459
00:38:24,323 --> 00:38:25,392
The Governess.

460
00:38:30,603 --> 00:38:33,515
I believe I must ask
your help after all.

461
00:38:33,723 --> 00:38:36,237
Would you get hold
of my horse s bridle

462
00:38:36,603 --> 00:38:37,558
and lead him to me?

463
00:38:40,603 --> 00:38:41,797
You re not afraid?

464
00:38:42,963 --> 00:38:43,839
No, sir.

465
00:38:56,163 --> 00:38:58,358
The mountain will
never come to Mahomet,

466
00:38:58,603 --> 00:39:00,559
so help Mahomet
go to the mountain.

467
00:39:00,763 --> 00:39:02,162
Would you come here?

468
00:39:05,563 --> 00:39:06,598
Excuse me.

469
00:39:07,403 --> 00:39:09,997
Necessity compels me
to make use of you.

470
00:39:30,523 --> 00:39:32,832
Thank you.
Would you hand me my hat?

471
00:39:33,123 --> 00:39:34,078
And crop.

472
00:39:40,003 --> 00:39:41,152
Thank you for your help.

473
00:39:44,843 --> 00:39:45,593
Now...

474
00:39:49,803 --> 00:39:51,680
make haste home as fast

475
00:39:52,323 --> 00:39:53,358
as you can.

476
00:40:29,923 --> 00:40:31,038
Whose dog is this?

477
00:40:31,443 --> 00:40:32,842
He came with the Master.

478
00:40:33,123 --> 00:40:35,159
- With whom?
- The Master.

479
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:36,672
Mr. Rochester.

480
00:40:36,923 --> 00:40:37,992
He just arrived.

481
00:40:48,123 --> 00:40:49,522
Here is Miss Eyre, sir.

482
00:40:56,843 --> 00:40:58,640
Is the leg more comfortable?

483
00:40:58,843 --> 00:41:00,435
Doctorwill be here
in the morning.

484
00:41:01,923 --> 00:41:04,073
Let Miss Eyre be seated.

485
00:41:09,283 --> 00:41:11,353
Look what Mr. Rochester
has brought me.

486
00:41:12,963 --> 00:41:14,919
Have you brought
Mademoiselle a present?

487
00:41:15,963 --> 00:41:17,874
<i>Did you expect a present?
Are you...</i>

488
00:41:20,843 --> 00:41:22,117
fond of presents?

489
00:41:23,123 --> 00:41:24,522
I hardly know, sir.

490
00:41:24,763 --> 00:41:26,560
I have little experience
ofthem.

491
00:41:27,043 --> 00:41:28,158
They are thought pleasant.

492
00:41:29,083 --> 00:41:30,675
Generally thought so,

493
00:41:31,043 --> 00:41:32,795
but what do you think?

494
00:41:33,683 --> 00:41:36,151
Apresent has many faces,
has it not?

495
00:41:38,003 --> 00:41:40,278
How long have you been
in my house?

496
00:41:40,643 --> 00:41:41,553
Four months.

497
00:41:42,443 --> 00:41:43,717
And you came from?

498
00:41:44,083 --> 00:41:45,675
Lowood School, Lancashire.

499
00:41:46,323 --> 00:41:47,358
Lowood!

500
00:41:48,523 --> 00:41:49,592
How long were you there?

501
00:41:50,123 --> 00:41:50,953
Ten years.

502
00:41:51,763 --> 00:41:52,798
Eight as a pupiI,

503
00:41:53,043 --> 00:41:54,362
two as a teacher.

504
00:41:54,723 --> 00:41:58,352
You must be tenacious to have
survived that place so long.

505
00:41:59,443 --> 00:42:02,082
You have
the look of another world.

506
00:42:03,363 --> 00:42:07,197
When I saw you, I thought
of fairy tales and almost asked

507
00:42:07,403 --> 00:42:09,121
if you d bewitched my horse.

508
00:42:10,363 --> 00:42:12,752
I m not sure yet
it is she who is

509
00:42:13,003 --> 00:42:14,721
responsible for my sprain.

510
00:42:14,963 --> 00:42:17,841
There was ice on the road.
It caused your horse

511
00:42:18,083 --> 00:42:18,993
to slip.

512
00:42:20,243 --> 00:42:21,073
Perhaps.

513
00:42:22,083 --> 00:42:23,516
I m not sure yet.

514
00:42:26,803 --> 00:42:28,316
Very well, Miss Eyre.

515
00:42:30,443 --> 00:42:31,842
I bid you goodnight.

516
00:42:48,243 --> 00:42:49,039
Adele.

517
00:42:49,803 --> 00:42:50,952
Watch and Iisten.

518
00:42:54,843 --> 00:42:56,071
You mean Iike this?

519
00:43:01,963 --> 00:43:03,681
I ve examined Adele.

520
00:43:04,443 --> 00:43:06,832
You ve taken great
pains with her.

521
00:43:08,363 --> 00:43:11,799
She s not bright,
she s no particular talent,

522
00:43:12,043 --> 00:43:14,193
yet she s made
much improvement.

523
00:43:14,403 --> 00:43:16,917
- Shes worked hard.
- You re teaching her piano?

524
00:43:17,243 --> 00:43:19,154
- Yes, sir.
- Are you fond of music?

525
00:43:19,363 --> 00:43:20,352
Do you play well?

526
00:43:20,643 --> 00:43:21,792
I'm very fond of it.

527
00:43:22,523 --> 00:43:23,512
I play a Iittle.

528
00:43:24,363 --> 00:43:26,672
Like any other
English schoolgirl.

529
00:43:26,923 --> 00:43:28,834
Perhaps better than some,
but not...

530
00:43:29,203 --> 00:43:30,033
well.

531
00:43:31,563 --> 00:43:33,315
Adele showed me some sketches.

532
00:43:35,963 --> 00:43:37,681
She said they were yours.

533
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:42,002
I don t knowif they
were of your doing...

534
00:43:43,683 --> 00:43:45,480
Perhaps a master helped you?

535
00:43:45,723 --> 00:43:46,951
No one helped me, sir.

536
00:43:48,203 --> 00:43:49,522
That wounds your pride.

537
00:43:54,083 --> 00:43:56,756
These pictures must have taken
much time.

538
00:43:58,203 --> 00:43:59,272
When did you do them?

539
00:44:00,163 --> 00:44:01,915
My last two vacations.

540
00:44:02,763 --> 00:44:03,798
Did you copy them?

541
00:44:04,043 --> 00:44:05,192
They came out of my head.

542
00:44:05,683 --> 00:44:08,322
That head I see now
on your shoulders?

543
00:44:09,243 --> 00:44:10,153
Yes, sir.

544
00:44:12,603 --> 00:44:15,401
Has it other furniture
of the same kind within?

545
00:44:15,843 --> 00:44:17,071
I think it may have.

546
00:44:17,403 --> 00:44:18,518
Better, I hope.

547
00:44:24,163 --> 00:44:26,393
Were you happy
when you painted them?

548
00:44:26,923 --> 00:44:29,881
I couldnt paint what was
in my imagination.

549
00:44:30,723 --> 00:44:32,873
I always wanted to achieve more.

550
00:44:35,643 --> 00:44:38,237
You may have
insufficient technique...

551
00:44:42,803 --> 00:44:44,873
but the thoughts are magical.

552
00:44:47,403 --> 00:44:48,756
Ah, nine o clock.

553
00:44:49,363 --> 00:44:51,923
- Is Adele in bed?
- Not yet, sir.

554
00:44:52,123 --> 00:44:55,718
She should be in bed.
I don't approve ofthese late hours.

555
00:44:57,043 --> 00:44:58,271
See to it, Miss Eyre.

556
00:45:08,923 --> 00:45:10,914
I would do the edges darker.

557
00:45:18,403 --> 00:45:19,802
His leg is better.

558
00:45:20,763 --> 00:45:22,515
He will be going away soon.

559
00:45:22,963 --> 00:45:23,839
Perhaps.

560
00:45:26,003 --> 00:45:27,675
It will break my heart.

561
00:45:29,483 --> 00:45:30,598
It s this one here.

562
00:45:34,123 --> 00:45:35,841
Could you draw me his picture?

563
00:45:36,283 --> 00:45:37,875
To always have him with me.

564
00:46:16,403 --> 00:46:18,394
You examined me,
Miss Eyre.

565
00:46:20,163 --> 00:46:21,516
You think me handsome?

566
00:46:22,603 --> 00:46:23,353
No, sir.

567
00:46:24,963 --> 00:46:28,353
There is something singular
about you. The air of a nun,

568
00:46:28,803 --> 00:46:32,318
quaint, quiet, grave and simple.
But when asked a question

569
00:46:32,923 --> 00:46:36,233
you are obliged to answer,
you rap out a reply

570
00:46:36,443 --> 00:46:39,162
which is at least brusque.
What do you mean?

571
00:46:39,723 --> 00:46:42,032
I was too plain.
I beg your pardon.

572
00:46:42,643 --> 00:46:44,873
I should have replied
that tastes differ.

573
00:46:45,163 --> 00:46:49,042
That beauty is of Iittle
consequence. Something Iike that.

574
00:46:50,123 --> 00:46:53,672
You will endure my surliness
without being hurt.

575
00:46:56,643 --> 00:47:00,158
Few masters would trouble
themselves to enquire

576
00:47:00,363 --> 00:47:02,479
if their employees
were offended.

577
00:47:03,643 --> 00:47:05,440
You never laugh, Miss Eyre?

578
00:47:07,683 --> 00:47:08,593
Never mind.

579
00:47:09,843 --> 00:47:12,960
Let me see what my employee
has been drawing.

580
00:47:18,363 --> 00:47:19,273
May I?

581
00:47:33,523 --> 00:47:35,115
You have me utterly.

582
00:47:38,403 --> 00:47:40,678
No, no, it's mine.

583
00:47:52,123 --> 00:47:53,112
Come, Miss Eyre.

584
00:47:55,363 --> 00:47:58,275
<i>Adele, continue with your work.
And remember...</i>

585
00:47:59,043 --> 00:48:01,159
shadows are as important
as Iight.

586
00:48:08,003 --> 00:48:10,392
- Do you believe that?
- What, sir?

587
00:48:12,163 --> 00:48:15,155
That shadows are as
important as Iight?

588
00:48:16,363 --> 00:48:18,513
I believe none of us is perfect,

589
00:48:19,523 --> 00:48:21,036
without some fault to hide.

590
00:48:28,603 --> 00:48:32,278
You are not naturally austere
nor I naturally vicious.

591
00:48:36,523 --> 00:48:39,037
I once had a heart
full of tender feelings.

592
00:48:41,843 --> 00:48:43,993
But fortune has knocked
me about.

593
00:48:46,043 --> 00:48:49,194
Now I m as hard and tough
as an India rubber ball.

594
00:49:00,323 --> 00:49:01,722
Is there any hope for me?

595
00:49:02,003 --> 00:49:03,152
Hope for what, sir?

596
00:49:03,923 --> 00:49:07,359
My being transformed from rubber
back to flesh and blood.

597
00:49:11,163 --> 00:49:12,198
Come on, Pilot.

598
00:49:30,603 --> 00:49:32,355
Is all well, my dear?

599
00:49:32,843 --> 00:49:34,435
What a strange man!

600
00:49:35,163 --> 00:49:37,313
So changeful and abrupt.

601
00:49:37,923 --> 00:49:40,517
I suppose I ve grown
accustomed to it.

602
00:49:41,563 --> 00:49:44,919
- And one has to make allowances.
- Why?

603
00:49:46,403 --> 00:49:48,314
Partly because it s his nature,

604
00:49:48,923 --> 00:49:51,198
and none of us
can help our nature.

605
00:49:51,763 --> 00:49:54,357
Partly...
family troubles.

606
00:49:54,563 --> 00:49:56,201
He has no family.

607
00:49:57,443 --> 00:49:59,354
There are painful memories

608
00:49:59,683 --> 00:50:01,799
which are perhaps
best forgotten.

609
00:50:45,683 --> 00:50:46,672
Well done, Adele.

610
00:50:48,763 --> 00:50:50,560
Is that how mama
danced for you?

611
00:50:53,643 --> 00:50:54,678
Precisely.

612
00:50:55,363 --> 00:50:56,352
Exactly.

613
00:50:58,123 --> 00:50:58,919
Now...

614
00:51:02,563 --> 00:51:04,758
Off to bed.
Fairfax, take her.

615
00:51:05,003 --> 00:51:06,800
Let me stay a while longer.

616
00:51:07,043 --> 00:51:08,954
- Let me dance again.
- You heard me.

617
00:51:09,363 --> 00:51:10,193
Please!

618
00:51:10,403 --> 00:51:10,960
Don t argue.

619
00:51:11,403 --> 00:51:12,631
Do as you re told.

620
00:51:13,163 --> 00:51:14,152
Come, Adele.

621
00:51:15,083 --> 00:51:15,720
Come.

622
00:51:27,603 --> 00:51:28,513
Well?

623
00:51:29,723 --> 00:51:33,079
Treat me as you will,
but dont treat a chiId thus.

624
00:51:33,283 --> 00:51:35,751
I will treat her
however I see fit.

625
00:51:38,723 --> 00:51:40,679
When I look at Adele,

626
00:51:41,083 --> 00:51:43,233
I see a miniature
of her mother.

627
00:51:43,963 --> 00:51:44,873
The same...

628
00:51:45,403 --> 00:51:48,475
beauty,
the same merciless charm.

629
00:51:50,283 --> 00:51:52,319
She was an opera dancer.

630
00:51:53,083 --> 00:51:55,313
I wasn t the first
to love her,

631
00:51:55,523 --> 00:51:58,321
but she told me that I...

632
00:51:58,963 --> 00:52:00,521
was Adele s father.

633
00:52:02,083 --> 00:52:04,392
At the time I wanted
to believe that.

634
00:52:04,603 --> 00:52:08,676
But one night, I found her in
the arms of a brainless viscount.

635
00:52:09,243 --> 00:52:11,677
I left a bullet
in his feeble wing,

636
00:52:12,563 --> 00:52:15,202
gave her my purse
and ordered heraway.

637
00:52:15,803 --> 00:52:16,633
<i>So...</i>

638
00:52:17,323 --> 00:52:19,678
perhaps you'll think
differently of the child.

639
00:52:19,923 --> 00:52:23,313
You'll tell me I should
look fora new Governess.

640
00:52:23,523 --> 00:52:26,083
She s not responsible
for her mother s faults.

641
00:52:26,283 --> 00:52:28,035
- Or yours.
- Or mine?

642
00:52:28,563 --> 00:52:30,713
What have I done but play
the village idiot?

643
00:52:30,963 --> 00:52:33,238
You've made Adele
feel unloved.

644
00:52:33,843 --> 00:52:35,799
Why didnt you
leave her in Paris?

645
00:52:36,043 --> 00:52:36,839
Because

646
00:52:37,083 --> 00:52:38,835
her mother abandoned her.

647
00:52:40,483 --> 00:52:43,839
When I looked around
I was all she had left.

648
00:52:46,323 --> 00:52:48,314
And I do honor
my obligations.

649
00:52:52,083 --> 00:52:53,721
However they were incurred.

650
00:52:57,163 --> 00:52:58,960
No one can deny me that.

651
00:53:03,763 --> 00:53:05,082
Goodnight, Miss Eyre.

652
00:54:13,763 --> 00:54:14,832
Mr. Rochester!

653
00:54:15,403 --> 00:54:16,677
Mr. Rochester, wake up!

654
00:54:27,123 --> 00:54:28,272
Wake up, sir, please!

655
00:54:36,923 --> 00:54:38,117
Is there a flood?

656
00:54:42,043 --> 00:54:42,998
Come on, sir.

657
00:54:58,443 --> 00:54:59,478
More water!

658
00:55:33,563 --> 00:55:34,518
What happened?

659
00:55:35,123 --> 00:55:36,192
I dont know.

660
00:55:37,923 --> 00:55:39,641
I heard a strange laugh.

661
00:55:40,363 --> 00:55:41,273
Grace.

662
00:55:42,923 --> 00:55:43,958
Where are you going?

663
00:55:44,443 --> 00:55:46,195
Stay here, don't move.

664
00:55:49,323 --> 00:55:50,961
Wrap yourself in my cloak.

665
00:55:52,643 --> 00:55:53,678
You re soaked.

666
00:56:11,603 --> 00:56:12,433
Grace!

667
00:56:16,283 --> 00:56:17,875
Open the door, Grace.

668
00:56:43,323 --> 00:56:44,915
It was as I thought.

669
00:56:45,603 --> 00:56:48,242
- Grace Poole, sir?
- Quiet so.

670
00:56:49,643 --> 00:56:51,042
You should send her away.

671
00:56:53,283 --> 00:56:55,672
Say nothing ofthis business.

672
00:56:57,603 --> 00:56:58,638
I will answer for

673
00:56:58,843 --> 00:56:59,753
all this.

674
00:57:03,323 --> 00:57:06,554
You can go to your room,
There s nothing more to fear.

675
00:57:15,443 --> 00:57:16,398
Goodnight, sir.

676
00:57:18,123 --> 00:57:18,953
What?

677
00:57:20,243 --> 00:57:21,517
Are you leaving me?

678
00:57:22,563 --> 00:57:23,632
You told me to go.

679
00:57:24,923 --> 00:57:27,721
Not in that brief, dry fashion.
Not without...

680
00:57:30,363 --> 00:57:31,478
taking leave.

681
00:57:32,043 --> 00:57:33,032
At least,

682
00:57:34,323 --> 00:57:35,472
shake hands.

683
00:57:42,083 --> 00:57:43,482
The roses had thorns.

684
00:57:51,003 --> 00:57:52,561
You have saved my life.

685
00:57:57,083 --> 00:57:58,482
I am in your debt.

686
00:57:58,963 --> 00:58:00,282
There is no debt,

687
00:58:00,603 --> 00:58:01,877
no obligation.

688
00:58:03,123 --> 00:58:05,956
I knew you d do me good
at some time.

689
00:58:06,163 --> 00:58:08,552
I saw it in your eyes
when I first beheld you.

690
00:58:10,563 --> 00:58:12,474
I'm glad I happened
to be awake.

691
00:58:17,283 --> 00:58:18,955
What s the matter?
You re shivering.

692
00:58:21,163 --> 00:58:22,118
I'm cold.

693
00:58:25,283 --> 00:58:26,238
Cold?

694
00:58:28,403 --> 00:58:29,438
You re cold?

695
00:58:30,123 --> 00:58:31,078
Yes, sir.

696
00:58:35,963 --> 00:58:37,157
Go then, Jane.

697
00:58:38,123 --> 00:58:39,351
Go back to bed.

698
00:58:50,043 --> 00:58:51,442
You call that clean?

699
00:58:51,963 --> 00:58:55,433
You and I are going
to have words downstairs.

700
00:59:02,123 --> 00:59:03,033
Good morning, Miss Eyre.

701
00:59:04,123 --> 00:59:04,999
What happened?

702
00:59:05,723 --> 00:59:08,283
The Master was reading
last night.

703
00:59:08,683 --> 00:59:12,358
He feel asleep with a candle lit
and the curtains got on fire.

704
00:59:12,763 --> 00:59:15,960
Luckily he woke up in time
to put the flames out.

705
00:59:16,163 --> 00:59:17,596
Here you are.
Hang them.

706
00:59:17,803 --> 00:59:19,316
Did nobody hear anything?

707
00:59:19,723 --> 00:59:20,758
Did nobody wake up?

708
00:59:21,363 --> 00:59:21,954
Perhaps

709
00:59:22,163 --> 00:59:23,312
you heard something?

710
00:59:24,523 --> 00:59:26,400
Yes, Grace... I did.

711
00:59:29,843 --> 00:59:31,322
I heard someone laughing.

712
00:59:35,043 --> 00:59:36,522
If I were you, Miss,

713
00:59:37,243 --> 00:59:41,361
I d get in the habit
of bolting my doorat night.

714
00:59:46,843 --> 00:59:49,801
Leah, that s one, and two...

715
00:59:51,283 --> 00:59:52,159
Good morning.

716
00:59:52,963 --> 00:59:53,998
Oh, Miss Eyre!

717
00:59:54,203 --> 00:59:56,273
You ve heard about the accident?

718
00:59:57,003 --> 00:59:58,755
It s a mercy he wasn t burnt

719
00:59:59,003 --> 01:00:00,755
in his bed. Leah!

720
01:00:01,523 --> 01:00:04,083
- Is he all right?
- Well enough...

721
01:00:04,683 --> 01:00:06,992
to be gone before breakfast.

722
01:00:07,203 --> 01:00:08,602
Gone? Gone where?

723
01:00:09,643 --> 01:00:12,157
Lord Ingram s,
the other side of Millcote.

724
01:00:12,363 --> 01:00:15,400
There s quite a party
assembled there. PiIlows.

725
01:00:16,923 --> 01:00:18,322
Do you expect himtonight?

726
01:00:18,763 --> 01:00:19,832
No, no.

727
01:00:20,083 --> 01:00:22,119
Nor tomorrow night either.

728
01:00:22,643 --> 01:00:26,238
When these fashionable people get
together, they re in no hurry.

729
01:00:26,643 --> 01:00:29,555
They may go to London
or the Continent.

730
01:00:31,963 --> 01:00:35,114
Mr. Rochester may not be back
for a year.

731
01:00:36,283 --> 01:00:38,922
Hes a favourite
with the ladies.

732
01:00:39,123 --> 01:00:39,999
Miss Blanche

733
01:00:40,203 --> 01:00:41,556
has been at him for years.

734
01:00:42,123 --> 01:00:43,078
Miss Blanche?

735
01:00:43,283 --> 01:00:46,275
Lord Ingram s daughter.
Prettiest girl in the county.

736
01:00:46,483 --> 01:00:47,518
She is, Miss.

737
01:00:48,403 --> 01:00:49,916
Does the Master like her?

738
01:00:51,083 --> 01:00:51,959
Oh, yes!

739
01:00:53,923 --> 01:00:56,278
He s different
when he s with her.

740
01:00:56,483 --> 01:00:59,316
So merry and lively
you wouldn t know him.

741
01:01:00,083 --> 01:01:00,993
Ah, Leah.

742
01:01:19,683 --> 01:01:20,877
You re a fool.

743
01:01:24,283 --> 01:01:26,001
I'll help you with this sheet.

744
01:01:28,683 --> 01:01:30,719
Hurry.
They'll be coming soon.

745
01:01:32,923 --> 01:01:35,596
James, hurry.
Take them to the dining room.

746
01:01:38,243 --> 01:01:39,915
My cornerto your corner.

747
01:01:42,003 --> 01:01:44,756
Have you something
we can keep a frog in?

748
01:01:45,003 --> 01:01:46,322
- Awhat?
- Afrog.

749
01:01:47,123 --> 01:01:49,353
My dear,
I have no time for frogs.

750
01:01:50,003 --> 01:01:51,959
Mr. Rochester
may be here any minute

751
01:01:52,163 --> 01:01:54,677
and all of Lord Ingrams friends
with him.

752
01:01:54,923 --> 01:01:56,720
Hes neverdone this before.

753
01:01:56,963 --> 01:01:59,761
They'll bring their maids
and theirvalets.

754
01:02:00,043 --> 01:02:02,841
In the past he couldn t wait
to leave Thornfield,

755
01:02:03,083 --> 01:02:05,916
now he s filling
the house with guests.

756
01:02:11,643 --> 01:02:13,634
- They re coming!
- What?

757
01:02:18,763 --> 01:02:21,880
Mademoiselle,
the beautiful ladies are coming!

758
01:02:26,043 --> 01:02:27,032
Lady Ingram.

759
01:02:27,803 --> 01:02:29,361
And Lady Eshton.

760
01:02:30,283 --> 01:02:31,636
Yes, and Lady Lynn.

761
01:02:34,483 --> 01:02:35,916
And that, of course,

762
01:02:36,483 --> 01:02:37,552
is Miss Blanche.

763
01:02:41,003 --> 01:02:42,402
- This way.
- Thank you.

764
01:03:04,363 --> 01:03:06,672
Is Mr. Rochester in love
with Miss Ingram?

765
01:03:07,523 --> 01:03:09,036
Don t ask such a question.

766
01:03:09,763 --> 01:03:10,513
Why not?

767
01:03:10,763 --> 01:03:12,116
It s none of our affair.

768
01:03:12,443 --> 01:03:14,434
It would be
ifthey got married.

769
01:03:14,683 --> 01:03:16,435
Adele, stop this conversation.

770
01:03:17,403 --> 01:03:18,722
Go back to your work.

771
01:03:20,603 --> 01:03:22,036
I hope he doesnt marry her.

772
01:03:22,843 --> 01:03:26,552
A maid told Leah she s only
interested in his money.

773
01:03:26,763 --> 01:03:28,515
She said he brought back bundles

774
01:03:28,723 --> 01:03:29,917
- fromJamaica.
- Adele!

775
01:03:40,483 --> 01:03:41,518
Miss Eyre!

776
01:03:44,443 --> 01:03:47,674
Mr. Rochester wants you
to bring Adele to the party,

777
01:03:48,003 --> 01:03:49,277
and he wants you to stay

778
01:03:49,483 --> 01:03:51,599
untiI it is her bedtime.

779
01:03:51,803 --> 01:03:53,361
He doesn t want me to stay?

780
01:03:53,563 --> 01:03:54,393
Oh, yes.

781
01:03:55,003 --> 01:03:56,755
'If she objects, tell her

782
01:03:57,003 --> 01:03:58,641
it is my particular wish.

783
01:03:59,323 --> 01:04:01,154
Those were his very words.

784
01:04:36,203 --> 01:04:37,113
Good evening.

785
01:04:37,403 --> 01:04:38,358
Good evening.

786
01:04:38,843 --> 01:04:40,071
What a Iittle puppet!

787
01:04:40,283 --> 01:04:42,194
That must be Mr. Rochester s ward.

788
01:04:42,403 --> 01:04:44,439
The Iittle French girl.

789
01:04:44,643 --> 01:04:47,077
- What s your name, chiId?
- Adele.

790
01:04:47,283 --> 01:04:49,433
So pretty, how charming.

791
01:04:50,483 --> 01:04:51,552
Adele, come here.

792
01:04:55,723 --> 01:04:58,999
Edward, I thought
you weren t fond of children.

793
01:04:59,643 --> 01:05:00,519
Nor am I.

794
01:05:01,003 --> 01:05:03,563
What persuaded you
to take charge of her?

795
01:05:04,763 --> 01:05:06,116
Where did you pick her up?

796
01:05:07,123 --> 01:05:10,195
I did not pick her up.
She was left on my hands.

797
01:05:10,403 --> 01:05:11,677
You should send her
to school.

798
01:05:12,083 --> 01:05:14,722
I couldnt afford it,
schools are expensive.

799
01:05:16,123 --> 01:05:17,476
You look after her?

800
01:05:18,163 --> 01:05:19,232
We have a Governess.

801
01:05:19,723 --> 01:05:22,601
AGoverness.
Yes, I thought I saw someone

802
01:05:22,803 --> 01:05:24,122
with her just now.

803
01:05:25,123 --> 01:05:27,000
You can tell a Governess
at first glance.

804
01:05:29,123 --> 01:05:30,112
They re plain,

805
01:05:30,403 --> 01:05:31,882
is a very special way.

806
01:05:32,683 --> 01:05:33,593
Arent they, Mama?

807
01:05:34,123 --> 01:05:35,602
Aren t who what?

808
01:05:36,123 --> 01:05:37,078
Governesses.

809
01:05:37,323 --> 01:05:39,200
Dont talk to me
about Governesses.

810
01:05:39,443 --> 01:05:42,116
The very word makes me
tremble with rage.

811
01:05:42,323 --> 01:05:44,439
I have suffered a martyrdom

812
01:05:44,643 --> 01:05:46,042
in their incompetence.

813
01:05:47,803 --> 01:05:48,394
What?

814
01:05:49,323 --> 01:05:49,960
Nothing.

815
01:05:50,603 --> 01:05:51,752
I said something wrong?

816
01:05:52,683 --> 01:05:54,913
She s sitting just
behind you.

817
01:05:56,003 --> 01:05:56,833
Who is?

818
01:05:57,083 --> 01:05:57,833
The Governess.

819
01:05:59,843 --> 01:06:01,595
Never mind.
It may do her

820
01:06:01,803 --> 01:06:02,952
good to hear the truth.
Come along...

821
01:06:07,963 --> 01:06:10,431
time for dancing.
I ve been idle too long.

822
01:06:10,643 --> 01:06:11,678
Bianca, will you do me

823
01:06:11,923 --> 01:06:12,833
the great honour?

824
01:06:13,803 --> 01:06:15,475
I didn t know you danced.

825
01:06:15,683 --> 01:06:16,479
He only dances

826
01:06:16,683 --> 01:06:18,913
- with me.
- Who else would I dance with?

827
01:06:19,323 --> 01:06:21,041
Mrs. Bennet, will you play?

828
01:07:10,643 --> 01:07:11,871
You look pale.

829
01:07:13,003 --> 01:07:13,913
Was my dancing

830
01:07:14,123 --> 01:07:15,442
- so clumsy?
- No, sir.

831
01:07:16,363 --> 01:07:18,797
Come back,
it s too early to go to bed.

832
01:07:19,043 --> 01:07:19,919
I'm tired, sir.

833
01:07:20,243 --> 01:07:21,756
And depressed.

834
01:07:25,203 --> 01:07:26,113
What about?

835
01:07:27,043 --> 01:07:30,399
- Nothing, sir. I m not depressed.
- But you are.

836
01:07:32,363 --> 01:07:36,038
Afew more words would bring
tears to your eyes.

837
01:07:36,803 --> 01:07:39,442
- I see them there now.
- Excuse me, sir.

838
01:07:39,643 --> 01:07:41,679
- I m very tired.
- Very well.

839
01:07:42,043 --> 01:07:43,032
I'll excuse you tonight,

840
01:07:43,243 --> 01:07:44,676
but while my visitors stay,

841
01:07:44,883 --> 01:07:47,192
I d like you to appear
in the drawing room every

842
01:07:47,403 --> 01:07:48,358
evening.

843
01:07:49,723 --> 01:07:52,112
It is my wish, Jane,
don t ignore it.

844
01:08:08,923 --> 01:08:10,151
May I help you, sir?

845
01:08:11,003 --> 01:08:11,879
I...

846
01:08:13,083 --> 01:08:14,516
I d Iike to see Mr. Rochester.

847
01:08:15,043 --> 01:08:16,476
We have guests.

848
01:08:18,083 --> 01:08:19,960
Mr. Rochester and I are old...

849
01:08:21,203 --> 01:08:24,832
old friends,
and I am very tired.

850
01:08:25,523 --> 01:08:28,799
I ve come a long way to see him.
FromJamaica.

851
01:08:38,443 --> 01:08:39,762
May I have your name, sir?

852
01:08:40,443 --> 01:08:40,955
<i>Mason...</i>

853
01:08:42,323 --> 01:08:43,472
Richard Mason.

854
01:08:45,243 --> 01:08:45,959
Peter.

855
01:08:46,683 --> 01:08:50,232
Take this gentleman
to the tapestry bedroom.

856
01:09:03,043 --> 01:09:04,556
Damn your luck, Dent!

857
01:09:10,563 --> 01:09:11,962
Anything else, sir?

858
01:09:13,283 --> 01:09:14,318
No, thank you.

859
01:10:16,963 --> 01:10:18,362
I need your help.

860
01:10:19,083 --> 01:10:20,038
What is it?

861
01:10:21,843 --> 01:10:22,878
Come with me.

862
01:10:27,723 --> 01:10:30,032
You don t turn sick
at the sight of blood?

863
01:10:30,923 --> 01:10:32,151
I don t think so.

864
01:10:32,963 --> 01:10:34,157
Give me your hand.

865
01:10:34,963 --> 01:10:36,919
It wont do to risk
your fainting.

866
01:10:44,683 --> 01:10:45,638
Here, Jane.

867
01:10:46,683 --> 01:10:48,355
There's a sponge
on the washstand.

868
01:10:48,723 --> 01:10:50,236
Try to stop the bleeding.

869
01:10:51,123 --> 01:10:53,239
I'll fetch the doctor.
I won t be long.

870
01:11:15,563 --> 01:11:16,359
<i>Sir...</i>

871
01:11:33,883 --> 01:11:35,362
I'll give you half an hour

872
01:11:36,443 --> 01:11:38,320
to dress his wound
and get him out.

873
01:11:43,763 --> 01:11:46,118
Why did you come,
why on earth?

874
01:11:46,323 --> 01:11:47,676
I thought
I could do some good.

875
01:11:47,923 --> 01:11:48,878
You thought.

876
01:11:50,403 --> 01:11:51,518
You thought!

877
01:11:52,603 --> 01:11:53,831
She said shed

878
01:11:54,043 --> 01:11:56,113
drain my heart.

879
01:11:58,043 --> 01:12:01,638
Keep him at your house untiI hes
well. I'll come in a day or two.

880
01:12:06,203 --> 01:12:07,682
Have pity on her.

881
01:12:08,403 --> 01:12:10,041
Let her be treated tenderly.

882
01:12:10,443 --> 01:12:11,637
- Let her be...
- Yes.

883
01:12:11,843 --> 01:12:13,162
I do my best.

884
01:12:14,923 --> 01:12:16,515
And will continue to do so.

885
01:12:18,563 --> 01:12:21,077
- It s not her fault.
- I knowthat.

886
01:12:21,283 --> 01:12:23,114
If anyones to blame,
it s you.

887
01:12:23,843 --> 01:12:24,753
Go.

888
01:12:35,963 --> 01:12:37,442
Ace of spades.

889
01:12:37,643 --> 01:12:39,554
You have the devil's own luck.

890
01:12:39,763 --> 01:12:43,073
You knowwhat they say.
Lucky in cards, unlucky in love.

891
01:12:43,283 --> 01:12:45,478
Penny, off you go
with the other guests.

892
01:12:46,563 --> 01:12:48,235
I m bored with this game.

893
01:12:49,403 --> 01:12:51,121
Why dont we play
something else?

894
01:12:52,643 --> 01:12:53,962
What would you Iike to play?

895
01:12:55,323 --> 01:12:58,998
Lord Brancaster has a billiard
table. Buy one, I adore

896
01:12:59,203 --> 01:13:00,113
billiards.

897
01:13:00,403 --> 01:13:01,961
They re rather expensive.

898
01:13:02,163 --> 01:13:03,562
I m not sure
I could afford one.

899
01:13:05,923 --> 01:13:07,675
Does that person want you?

900
01:13:15,603 --> 01:13:16,672
Is something wrong?

901
01:13:16,883 --> 01:13:17,952
May I speak to you?

902
01:13:18,563 --> 01:13:19,598
7 card whist?

903
01:13:23,523 --> 01:13:24,592
What is it?

904
01:13:25,563 --> 01:13:27,440
I received a letter
this morning.

905
01:13:27,883 --> 01:13:29,635
I want leave of absence.

906
01:13:30,003 --> 01:13:30,833
Why?

907
01:13:32,003 --> 01:13:34,961
- An old lady who s sick.
- What old lady?

908
01:13:35,443 --> 01:13:37,832
Her name is Mrs. Reed.
She s my aunt.

909
01:13:38,443 --> 01:13:41,833
- I thought you had no relatives.
- None that would own me.

910
01:13:42,163 --> 01:13:44,313
She cast me off
when I was a child.

911
01:13:44,523 --> 01:13:47,435
- Then why go offto see her?
- Shes dying.

912
01:13:47,963 --> 01:13:49,555
I cant ignore her dying wish.

913
01:13:52,283 --> 01:13:53,875
You wont be
persuaded to stay?

914
01:13:54,923 --> 01:13:55,878
No, sir.

915
01:13:57,083 --> 01:13:58,801
I will return to Thornfield.

916
01:14:02,083 --> 01:14:03,755
So we must say goodbye.

917
01:14:05,163 --> 01:14:06,073
Yes, sir.

918
01:14:08,883 --> 01:14:11,443
How does one perform that ceremony?
Teach me.

919
01:14:12,963 --> 01:14:15,602
They say farewell.
Or any form they prefer.

920
01:14:19,083 --> 01:14:20,482
Farewell, Miss Eyre.

921
01:14:24,523 --> 01:14:25,558
For the present.

922
01:14:28,843 --> 01:14:29,832
Is that all?

923
01:14:30,483 --> 01:14:31,279
Yes, sir.

924
01:14:33,843 --> 01:14:35,242
Why don t we shake hands?

925
01:14:45,243 --> 01:14:46,517
Remember your promise.

926
01:15:24,203 --> 01:15:25,192
Mr. Rivers?

927
01:15:25,523 --> 01:15:26,717
Miss Eyre is here.

928
01:15:28,283 --> 01:15:29,193
Miss Eyre.

929
01:15:30,003 --> 01:15:32,756
St. John Rivers, Rectorof
Gateshead. How do you do?

930
01:15:32,963 --> 01:15:33,918
Please come in.

931
01:15:34,643 --> 01:15:36,838
Your aunt is most anxious
to see you.

932
01:15:37,323 --> 01:15:38,995
He family is in trouble.

933
01:15:39,203 --> 01:15:42,479
John Reed, your cousin,
died last month in London.

934
01:15:42,883 --> 01:15:44,077
He died. How?

935
01:15:44,603 --> 01:15:47,163
He ruined his health
with bad company.

936
01:15:48,163 --> 01:15:50,119
That brought on
your aunt s illness.

937
01:15:51,683 --> 01:15:52,718
My sister, Mary.

938
01:15:53,523 --> 01:15:55,241
I mtaking her to see her aunt.

939
01:15:55,443 --> 01:15:56,762
I'll be back presently.

940
01:16:08,123 --> 01:16:09,442
You are Iike...

941
01:16:13,323 --> 01:16:14,802
Why, you are like...

942
01:16:16,443 --> 01:16:17,796
Jane Eyre.

943
01:16:18,683 --> 01:16:19,638
I am Jane Eyre.

944
01:16:22,963 --> 01:16:24,032
I am very ill.

945
01:16:30,763 --> 01:16:32,879
My mind is much troubled

946
01:16:34,043 --> 01:16:35,999
by two wrongs
I have done you.

947
01:16:37,443 --> 01:16:38,239
<i>One...</i>

948
01:16:39,083 --> 01:16:42,439
<i>was breaking my promise
to my husband...</i>

949
01:16:43,523 --> 01:16:44,751
to bring you up as

950
01:16:44,963 --> 01:16:46,442
one of my own.

951
01:16:47,523 --> 01:16:48,433
The other...

952
01:16:49,843 --> 01:16:51,913
Go to my writing case.

953
01:16:54,443 --> 01:16:56,399
Take out the letter
you find there.

954
01:17:13,523 --> 01:17:14,399
Read the letter.

955
01:17:24,523 --> 01:17:28,277
Will you have the goodness
to send the address of my niece,

956
01:17:28,763 --> 01:17:29,673
Jane Eyre,

957
01:17:30,523 --> 01:17:32,115
and to tell me how she is.

958
01:17:32,923 --> 01:17:36,882
It is my intention to ask her
to come to me at Madeira.

959
01:17:39,003 --> 01:17:41,312
<i>As I am unmarried
and childless...</i>

960
01:17:41,763 --> 01:17:44,118
<i>I wish to adopt her
during my Iife...</i>

961
01:17:44,603 --> 01:17:46,514
and bequeath her at my death...

962
01:17:46,843 --> 01:17:48,754
whatever I may
have to leave.

963
01:17:52,363 --> 01:17:54,194
This is dated 3 years ago.

964
01:17:55,843 --> 01:17:57,435
Why did he never write?

965
01:18:00,123 --> 01:18:01,602
<i>I wrote to him...</i>

966
01:18:05,443 --> 01:18:07,593
I said I knew
nothing about you.

967
01:18:12,203 --> 01:18:14,239
Now, act as you please.

968
01:18:16,443 --> 01:18:17,671
Write to him...

969
01:18:19,883 --> 01:18:21,111
tell him I Iied.

970
01:18:25,683 --> 01:18:28,402
You were born to be
my torment.

971
01:18:31,243 --> 01:18:32,722
I am not vindictive.

972
01:18:34,083 --> 01:18:35,562
Let us be friends.

973
01:18:43,043 --> 01:18:45,079
Love me or hate me as you will.

974
01:18:46,363 --> 01:18:48,638
You have my full
and free forgiveness.

975
01:19:01,683 --> 01:19:02,638
Mademoiselle!

976
01:19:03,883 --> 01:19:04,759
Mademoiselle!

977
01:19:04,963 --> 01:19:08,353
- I thought you d left for good.
- I said I d come back.

978
01:19:08,603 --> 01:19:10,878
You said a week.
It s almost a month.

979
01:19:11,083 --> 01:19:12,152
Forgive me, Adele.

980
01:19:12,843 --> 01:19:15,152
Mr. Rochester
is sending me to school.

981
01:19:15,843 --> 01:19:17,276
I was afraid I d be gone

982
01:19:17,523 --> 01:19:20,162
- and never see you again.
- To school?

983
01:19:20,363 --> 01:19:20,954
To Paris.

984
01:19:21,163 --> 01:19:22,721
Aschool for young ladies.

985
01:19:26,283 --> 01:19:26,999
Adele.

986
01:19:28,843 --> 01:19:31,118
Tell cook
Miss Eyre has returned.

987
01:19:31,843 --> 01:19:33,276
Another place at dinner.

988
01:19:35,683 --> 01:19:37,162
I'll ask her
to make a cake.

989
01:19:46,043 --> 01:19:47,556
You came back after all?

990
01:19:48,003 --> 01:19:48,992
As I promised.

991
01:19:51,243 --> 01:19:52,437
As you promised.

992
01:20:16,843 --> 01:20:18,595
You re very quiet
this evening.

993
01:20:23,683 --> 01:20:25,116
What s on your mind?

994
01:20:25,683 --> 01:20:26,832
Many things, sir.

995
01:20:27,603 --> 01:20:28,718
My aunt s death.

996
01:20:29,123 --> 01:20:30,795
Being back at Thornfield.

997
01:20:32,243 --> 01:20:33,073
And?

998
01:20:35,843 --> 01:20:38,357
Adele says you re sending
her to school.

999
01:20:38,603 --> 01:20:39,274
Yes.

1000
01:20:41,683 --> 01:20:44,993
It s a good idea, dont you think?
Paris is her home.

1001
01:20:47,043 --> 01:20:48,476
May I ask why, sir?

1002
01:20:49,523 --> 01:20:51,434
I thought you might
have guessed.

1003
01:20:54,083 --> 01:20:54,993
<i>Perhaps...</i>

1004
01:20:55,443 --> 01:20:57,320
because you re
going to be married.

1005
01:21:00,203 --> 01:21:01,192
Exactly.

1006
01:21:02,843 --> 01:21:03,832
Precisely.

1007
01:21:05,603 --> 01:21:08,595
With your usual acuteness,
you ve hit the nail on the head.

1008
01:21:10,363 --> 01:21:11,637
I amto be married.

1009
01:21:14,243 --> 01:21:16,632
Which means Adele
will go to school.

1010
01:21:19,123 --> 01:21:20,715
You'll need another situation.

1011
01:21:21,763 --> 01:21:25,199
<i>- I will advertise directly...
- No, you will not.</i>

1012
01:21:25,603 --> 01:21:27,480
I ve heard of a position
that suits you.

1013
01:21:28,163 --> 01:21:29,562
Governess to 5 daughters

1014
01:21:29,763 --> 01:21:31,196
of a family in Ireland.

1015
01:21:32,083 --> 01:21:33,436
It s a long way off.

1016
01:21:35,363 --> 01:21:37,638
Agirl of your sense
won t object to the voyage.

1017
01:21:37,843 --> 01:21:39,071
<i>But the distance...</i>

1018
01:21:39,283 --> 01:21:40,716
And the sea is a barrier.

1019
01:21:43,683 --> 01:21:45,321
From what, Jane?

1020
01:21:46,003 --> 01:21:47,152
From England, sir.

1021
01:21:48,003 --> 01:21:49,516
And from Thornfield.

1022
01:21:50,883 --> 01:21:51,599
And...

1023
01:21:57,203 --> 01:21:59,797
Sometimes I have the strangest
feeling about you...

1024
01:22:01,243 --> 01:22:03,598
Especially when you re near,
Iike now.

1025
01:22:04,963 --> 01:22:06,954
It s as though I had a string

1026
01:22:09,163 --> 01:22:12,075
tied here, under my rib,
where my heart is.

1027
01:22:14,963 --> 01:22:18,433
<i>Tightly knotted to you...
in a similar fashion.</i>

1028
01:22:20,123 --> 01:22:21,522
When you go to Ireland,

1029
01:22:22,843 --> 01:22:25,073
with all that distance
between us,

1030
01:22:26,203 --> 01:22:28,797
I m afraid this cord
will be snapped...

1031
01:22:29,843 --> 01:22:31,913
and I shall bleed inwardly.

1032
01:22:33,603 --> 01:22:34,592
But you are sensible.

1033
01:22:34,843 --> 01:22:36,834
- You'll forget.
- I'll never forget!

1034
01:22:38,163 --> 01:22:39,676
I wish I d never been born.

1035
01:22:40,123 --> 01:22:41,033
I wish I d never come

1036
01:22:41,243 --> 01:22:43,074
- to Thornfield.
- There are other houses.

1037
01:22:43,963 --> 01:22:45,681
How can you be so stupid?

1038
01:22:46,243 --> 01:22:47,881
How can you be so cruel?

1039
01:22:48,883 --> 01:22:52,034
I may be poor and plain,
but I m not without feelings.

1040
01:22:53,363 --> 01:22:55,433
It's not the house,
but the life here.

1041
01:22:55,843 --> 01:22:57,322
I was not trampled on.

1042
01:22:57,843 --> 01:22:59,401
I was not excluded.

1043
01:23:00,523 --> 01:23:02,559
I was treated as an equal.

1044
01:23:06,843 --> 01:23:08,481
And so you are, Jane.

1045
01:23:23,963 --> 01:23:24,952
<i>And so...</i>

1046
01:23:28,083 --> 01:23:29,072
<i>And so...</i>

1047
01:23:32,603 --> 01:23:33,877
Yes, so, sir...

1048
01:23:35,083 --> 01:23:37,551
And yet not so,
for you re a married man.

1049
01:23:37,963 --> 01:23:39,362
Or as good as married.

1050
01:23:39,923 --> 01:23:41,197
- Let me go.
- Be still.

1051
01:23:43,203 --> 01:23:46,320
Don t struggle. You re like
a bird clawing at its cage.

1052
01:23:46,523 --> 01:23:50,152
I m no caged bird. I m
a free human being, independent,

1053
01:23:50,363 --> 01:23:51,796
with a will of my own.

1054
01:23:54,163 --> 01:23:55,118
Then stay.

1055
01:23:58,363 --> 01:23:59,557
Stay and marry me.

1056
01:24:00,203 --> 01:24:02,876
- How dare you make fun of me?
- I mean it.

1057
01:24:03,883 --> 01:24:06,078
Stay at Thornfield.
Be my wife.

1058
01:24:07,163 --> 01:24:08,278
What of Miss Ingram?

1059
01:24:08,523 --> 01:24:11,037
I don t love her,
nor does she love me.

1060
01:24:14,683 --> 01:24:17,914
Jane, you strange,
almost unearthly thing,

1061
01:24:20,243 --> 01:24:22,438
I love you
as my own flesh.

1062
01:24:26,043 --> 01:24:27,522
I beg of you to marry me.

1063
01:24:31,923 --> 01:24:34,562
Say Edward, give me my name.

1064
01:24:38,243 --> 01:24:40,313
Say Edward, I will marry you.

1065
01:24:49,283 --> 01:24:49,999
Yes.

1066
01:24:51,363 --> 01:24:52,159
Yes.

1067
01:24:55,083 --> 01:24:56,072
Yes, Edward.

1068
01:25:09,243 --> 01:25:11,279
I hardly knowwhat to say.

1069
01:25:11,523 --> 01:25:14,913
I m so astonished,
I feel I must have been dreaming.

1070
01:25:16,683 --> 01:25:19,959
I thought Mr. Rochester
came in here

1071
01:25:20,443 --> 01:25:21,637
and said...

1072
01:25:22,323 --> 01:25:25,872
that in a month s time
you were to be his wife.

1073
01:25:26,763 --> 01:25:28,242
He said the same to me.

1074
01:25:29,443 --> 01:25:31,115
You know how much I like you,

1075
01:25:32,123 --> 01:25:33,351
Jane, but...

1076
01:25:35,323 --> 01:25:36,472
you re so young...

1077
01:25:38,003 --> 01:25:40,198
and little acquainted with men.

1078
01:25:42,603 --> 01:25:44,002
I have noticed

1079
01:25:44,203 --> 01:25:47,354
Mr. Rochester s growing
fondness for you...

1080
01:25:49,203 --> 01:25:51,273
And I have wanted
so many times...

1081
01:25:53,523 --> 01:25:55,002
for your sake,

1082
01:25:55,363 --> 01:25:57,274
to put you on your guard.

1083
01:25:57,603 --> 01:25:57,955
Why?

1084
01:26:00,203 --> 01:26:01,875
<i>There is an old saying...</i>

1085
01:26:03,043 --> 01:26:05,477
all is not gold
that glitters'.

1086
01:26:07,763 --> 01:26:09,958
<i>And in this case I fear...</i>

1087
01:26:11,883 --> 01:26:14,078
something different...

1088
01:26:14,883 --> 01:26:16,441
<i>may be found...</i>

1089
01:26:16,883 --> 01:26:18,839
from what you or I expect.

1090
01:26:19,523 --> 01:26:21,912
Is it impossible
that Mr. Rochester

1091
01:26:22,123 --> 01:26:24,159
should have a sincere
affection for me?

1092
01:26:24,363 --> 01:26:25,398
Oh, no, no.

1093
01:26:25,603 --> 01:26:27,434
<i>It is not that,
my dear, it s...</i>

1094
01:26:29,083 --> 01:26:30,596
He is a proud man.

1095
01:26:31,323 --> 01:26:33,234
All the Rochesters
were proud.

1096
01:26:35,443 --> 01:26:37,559
And gentlemen in his station

1097
01:26:37,843 --> 01:26:40,596
are not accustomed to marrying
their governesses.

1098
01:26:58,083 --> 01:26:59,198
Now, then...

1099
01:27:00,843 --> 01:27:02,913
Let s try the cape on,
shall we?

1100
01:27:03,603 --> 01:27:05,400
<i>There... Turn around.</i>

1101
01:27:05,843 --> 01:27:06,958
Turn around, dear.

1102
01:27:07,923 --> 01:27:10,596
Oh, you look beautiful.

1103
01:27:18,523 --> 01:27:21,481
- Have you been to the chapel?
- The parson s arrived.

1104
01:27:21,683 --> 01:27:23,992
- The carriage?
- The horses have been harnessed.

1105
01:27:24,203 --> 01:27:27,081
- We'll leave the moment it s over.
- Yes, sir.

1106
01:27:28,763 --> 01:27:30,799
- Jane!
- Yes, I'm here.

1107
01:27:39,163 --> 01:27:40,232
Any regrets?

1108
01:27:41,843 --> 01:27:45,552
Adele is away. Shed have
loved to see me in this dress.

1109
01:27:47,683 --> 01:27:49,560
I will have a portrait painted

1110
01:27:50,043 --> 01:27:51,396
and sent to her.

1111
01:27:52,363 --> 01:27:53,034
Like this,

1112
01:27:53,243 --> 01:27:54,881
with the morning Iight.

1113
01:28:16,963 --> 01:28:19,397
We are gathered together
in the sight of God...

1114
01:28:20,683 --> 01:28:23,834
to join together
this man and this woman

1115
01:28:24,243 --> 01:28:25,392
in Holy Matrimony.

1116
01:28:28,083 --> 01:28:31,234
<i>,... so many as are coupled together
but as God's word</i>

1117
01:28:31,443 --> 01:28:32,512
both allow,

1118
01:28:32,923 --> 01:28:34,834
are not joined by God...

1119
01:28:35,843 --> 01:28:37,435
The marriage cannot go on.

1120
01:28:37,683 --> 01:28:39,719
I declare an impediment.

1121
01:28:42,843 --> 01:28:44,515
- Continue, sir.
- I cannot.

1122
01:28:45,283 --> 01:28:47,001
What is the nature

1123
01:28:47,203 --> 01:28:48,477
of this impediment?

1124
01:28:52,443 --> 01:28:53,876
Mr. Rochester

1125
01:28:54,523 --> 01:28:55,638
is a married man.

1126
01:28:58,083 --> 01:29:00,278
- Who are you?
- My name is Briggs.

1127
01:29:00,683 --> 01:29:01,672
I'm a lawyer.

1128
01:29:02,323 --> 01:29:04,154
I am looking after
the interests

1129
01:29:04,363 --> 01:29:05,398
of your wife.

1130
01:29:05,603 --> 01:29:07,241
There is no wife!

1131
01:29:07,683 --> 01:29:11,881
'I affirm and can prove that
on the 20th day of October 1829,

1132
01:29:13,043 --> 01:29:16,956
Edward Fairfax Rochester of
Thornfield Hall, was married

1133
01:29:17,443 --> 01:29:18,717
to my sister,

1134
01:29:19,003 --> 01:29:20,834
Bertha Antoinetta.

1135
01:29:21,203 --> 01:29:22,272
Acopy of the wedding

1136
01:29:22,523 --> 01:29:25,401
certificate is now
in my possession.

1137
01:29:26,043 --> 01:29:28,841
Signed, Richard Mason.

1138
01:29:30,883 --> 01:29:34,159
That proves I ve been married,
not that she is still Iiving.

1139
01:29:34,523 --> 01:29:37,595
She was three months ago.
I have a witness.

1140
01:29:38,043 --> 01:29:39,192
Produce him, damn you!

1141
01:29:39,603 --> 01:29:41,161
Do not forget you are in

1142
01:29:41,443 --> 01:29:42,239
a sacred place.

1143
01:29:42,603 --> 01:29:45,436
Have the goodness
to step forward, sir.

1144
01:29:51,683 --> 01:29:52,718
Mason!

1145
01:30:04,323 --> 01:30:05,312
Close your book.

1146
01:30:08,323 --> 01:30:09,722
There'll be no wedding.

1147
01:30:13,203 --> 01:30:15,114
What these men say is true.

1148
01:30:16,203 --> 01:30:17,636
I have been married...

1149
01:30:21,003 --> 01:30:23,278
and the woman lives still.

1150
01:30:29,523 --> 01:30:30,922
Come to the house,
all of you...

1151
01:30:31,883 --> 01:30:34,443
<i>and meet Grace Pooles patient...</i>

1152
01:30:35,843 --> 01:30:37,242
My wife!

1153
01:30:59,763 --> 01:31:01,754
Stay out ofthe way, Grace.

1154
01:31:02,683 --> 01:31:03,672
Be careful, sir.

1155
01:31:04,283 --> 01:31:05,682
She s a bit snappish.

1156
01:31:10,923 --> 01:31:13,391
She s seen you, sir,
you d better not stay.

1157
01:31:13,603 --> 01:31:15,321
- We'd better leave.
- You stay here!

1158
01:31:16,363 --> 01:31:17,352
This is my wife.

1159
01:31:18,203 --> 01:31:19,636
Your sister, Mason.

1160
01:31:20,443 --> 01:31:22,911
Look at her. She is mad.

1161
01:31:23,603 --> 01:31:24,956
So was her mother.

1162
01:31:25,883 --> 01:31:26,872
So was her grandmother.

1163
01:31:28,363 --> 01:31:31,321
Three generations
of violent lunacy.

1164
01:31:31,523 --> 01:31:32,558
I wasnt told

1165
01:31:32,763 --> 01:31:34,355
about that,
was I, Mason?

1166
01:31:34,603 --> 01:31:36,002
All I was told about

1167
01:31:36,203 --> 01:31:39,752
was that my father had made a
suitable match to prop up

1168
01:31:39,963 --> 01:31:41,954
his dwindling fortune
and give your family

1169
01:31:42,163 --> 01:31:43,596
the Rochester name.

1170
01:31:44,763 --> 01:31:46,754
I did what I was told!

1171
01:31:51,603 --> 01:31:52,877
And Bertha

1172
01:31:54,203 --> 01:31:56,398
was kept away from me

1173
01:31:56,763 --> 01:31:58,276
untiI the wedding.
It was cleverly done.

1174
01:32:00,283 --> 01:32:02,160
Everyone got what they wanted

1175
01:32:03,003 --> 01:32:04,118
except me.

1176
01:32:05,243 --> 01:32:06,198
Even

1177
01:32:06,963 --> 01:32:10,080
<i>she is betteroff here
than in an asylum...</i>

1178
01:32:10,283 --> 01:32:13,320
but I have spent
the last 15 years in torment.

1179
01:32:19,443 --> 01:32:20,922
And this is what I...

1180
01:32:21,523 --> 01:32:23,002
what I wish to have.

1181
01:32:24,523 --> 01:32:28,198
This young girl stands
so grave and quiet at the mouth

1182
01:32:29,363 --> 01:32:30,352
of Hell.

1183
01:32:32,923 --> 01:32:34,356
- Bertha!
- No, Ma am.

1184
01:32:36,363 --> 01:32:38,718
Hold her down!

1185
01:32:38,923 --> 01:32:41,517
- Keep calm, lass, calm.
- Hold her, Grace.

1186
01:32:41,763 --> 01:32:42,354
Take care.

1187
01:32:42,603 --> 01:32:43,831
Calm, calm, lass.

1188
01:33:18,763 --> 01:33:19,832
I love you.

1189
01:33:20,523 --> 01:33:21,717
Say you love me.

1190
01:33:23,843 --> 01:33:25,322
I love you more than ever.

1191
01:33:25,843 --> 01:33:28,403
But this is the last time
I shall ever say it.

1192
01:33:29,763 --> 01:33:30,957
I must leave you.

1193
01:34:00,003 --> 01:34:01,755
Don t leave me, Jane!

1194
01:34:12,243 --> 01:34:13,119
The horse!

1195
01:34:26,763 --> 01:34:27,752
Mr. Rochester!

1196
01:34:29,963 --> 01:34:31,760
Mr. Rochester!
The house, sir!

1197
01:35:11,283 --> 01:35:13,672
<i>- Trust me, Bertha, trust me.
- Leah...</i>

1198
01:35:13,883 --> 01:35:15,760
John, wheres Mr. Rochester?

1199
01:35:16,123 --> 01:35:17,875
Mr. Rochester, help me!

1200
01:35:18,083 --> 01:35:19,835
Help me, somebody!

1201
01:35:29,603 --> 01:35:30,353
Bertha.

1202
01:35:31,603 --> 01:35:34,276
Bertha, come close to me,
don't be afraid.

1203
01:35:34,963 --> 01:35:35,839
Come to me.

1204
01:35:36,283 --> 01:35:37,398
Give me your hand.

1205
01:35:38,443 --> 01:35:39,717
Bertha, come to me.

1206
01:35:40,883 --> 01:35:42,362
I would never harm you.

1207
01:35:43,163 --> 01:35:45,074
Dont be afraid.
Come to me.

1208
01:35:46,123 --> 01:35:46,953
Please.

1209
01:35:47,883 --> 01:35:48,633
Come, come on.

1210
01:36:17,963 --> 01:36:19,112
Oh, here we are.

1211
01:36:24,843 --> 01:36:26,640
- This is for York.
- Thank you.

1212
01:36:27,043 --> 01:36:29,637
- And this is for you.
- Thank you.

1213
01:36:29,843 --> 01:36:30,798
Good day to you.

1214
01:36:33,243 --> 01:36:34,562
Miss Eyre, isnt it?

1215
01:36:36,363 --> 01:36:39,799
Remember me? I m Mary Rivers,
the rector's sister.

1216
01:36:42,963 --> 01:36:43,873
Are you ill?

1217
01:36:58,283 --> 01:37:00,239
- How is she?
- She s had a good sleep.

1218
01:37:00,443 --> 01:37:02,081
Now may be a good time
to talk to her.

1219
01:37:06,523 --> 01:37:08,593
- How are you feeling?
- You look better.

1220
01:37:09,603 --> 01:37:10,718
The doctor is pleased.

1221
01:37:10,923 --> 01:37:13,198
You'll be well enough
to come down soon.

1222
01:37:13,763 --> 01:37:15,719
I ve been here almost a month.

1223
01:37:15,963 --> 01:37:18,033
I can t stay here any longer.

1224
01:37:18,323 --> 01:37:20,553
I must find work
and somewhere to Iive.

1225
01:37:21,083 --> 01:37:22,596
Hush, be still.

1226
01:37:23,603 --> 01:37:25,002
Stay as long as you wish.

1227
01:37:26,763 --> 01:37:28,196
Don t make her talk any more.

1228
01:37:29,043 --> 01:37:29,953
Tell her.

1229
01:37:34,603 --> 01:37:35,479
Miss Eyre.

1230
01:37:37,363 --> 01:37:41,402
I did not want to excite you,
but I have some surprising news.

1231
01:37:42,083 --> 01:37:44,472
Agentleman has been here
looking for you.

1232
01:37:44,763 --> 01:37:45,513
A lawyer.

1233
01:37:46,443 --> 01:37:48,957
I took it upon myself
to act on your behalf.

1234
01:37:49,523 --> 01:37:50,433
A lawyer.

1235
01:37:51,283 --> 01:37:52,352
What did he want?

1236
01:37:54,763 --> 01:37:58,551
It seems your uncle in Madeira,
John Eyre, has died

1237
01:37:58,763 --> 01:38:00,401
and left you his estate.

1238
01:38:01,523 --> 01:38:05,402
He always believed you were alive
and that you would be found.

1239
01:38:06,883 --> 01:38:08,999
You re his only
surviving relative.

1240
01:38:11,443 --> 01:38:13,001
You have become a wealthy woman.

1241
01:38:17,603 --> 01:38:20,197
These are the papers relating
to your uncle,

1242
01:38:20,443 --> 01:38:23,799
and the fortune
you will inherit.

1243
01:38:25,603 --> 01:38:27,195
This is your uncle, John Eyre.

1244
01:38:33,683 --> 01:38:34,593
And your father...

1245
01:38:35,203 --> 01:38:36,716
the father you never knew.

1246
01:38:38,323 --> 01:38:39,722
How young he looks.

1247
01:38:40,323 --> 01:38:41,517
And how kind.

1248
01:38:42,163 --> 01:38:43,118
He was kind.

1249
01:38:44,203 --> 01:38:46,478
Amongst the papers
is the letter he wrote

1250
01:38:47,243 --> 01:38:49,518
to your uncle announcing
your birth.

1251
01:38:54,683 --> 01:38:56,196
You were deeply loved.

1252
01:38:59,443 --> 01:39:00,478
Please forgive me.

1253
01:39:03,323 --> 01:39:04,722
There is nothing to forgive.

1254
01:39:11,043 --> 01:39:13,113
I know you have suffered greatly.

1255
01:39:15,363 --> 01:39:17,115
But the past can no longer
harm you.

1256
01:39:19,843 --> 01:39:21,196
You are safe now.

1257
01:39:41,683 --> 01:39:44,834
Jane, you strange,
almost unearthly thing,

1258
01:39:45,443 --> 01:39:48,162
I love you as my own flesh.

1259
01:39:55,283 --> 01:39:56,272
I love you.

1260
01:39:57,603 --> 01:39:58,956
Say you love me.

1261
01:41:12,843 --> 01:41:13,992
Mrs. Fairfax?

1262
01:41:22,443 --> 01:41:23,159
Pilot.

1263
01:41:24,523 --> 01:41:25,592
Hello, Pilot.

1264
01:41:25,843 --> 01:41:26,480
Pilot!

1265
01:41:30,443 --> 01:41:31,080
Pilot!

1266
01:41:35,043 --> 01:41:36,112
No more noise.

1267
01:41:39,603 --> 01:41:40,513
Miss Eyre!

1268
01:41:55,043 --> 01:41:56,237
Mrs. Fairfax,

1269
01:41:57,163 --> 01:41:58,721
bring me a glass of water.

1270
01:42:14,203 --> 01:42:15,113
Who s there?

1271
01:42:16,843 --> 01:42:17,719
Who is it?

1272
01:42:19,523 --> 01:42:20,558
Pilot knows me.

1273
01:42:26,363 --> 01:42:28,274
My brain will burst.

1274
01:42:31,683 --> 01:42:33,560
What delusion is this?

1275
01:42:36,043 --> 01:42:37,396
What sweet madness!

1276
01:42:43,363 --> 01:42:44,557
Her fingers.

1277
01:42:44,843 --> 01:42:45,958
Her very fingers.

1278
01:42:46,883 --> 01:42:47,952
Jane Eyre.

1279
01:42:49,283 --> 01:42:50,352
Jane Eyre.

1280
01:42:52,923 --> 01:42:55,278
So many times I ve dreamed
ofthis moment.

1281
01:42:55,683 --> 01:42:58,197
Then the dream vanishes
and flies away.

1282
01:43:02,363 --> 01:43:04,672
Gentle dream.
Kiss me before you go.

1283
01:43:04,883 --> 01:43:06,521
I shall never leave you.

1284
01:43:19,923 --> 01:43:21,595
You will stay with me?

1285
01:43:23,963 --> 01:43:24,873
How?

1286
01:43:25,683 --> 01:43:29,232
I will be your friend,
your nurse, your companion.

1287
01:43:30,763 --> 01:43:33,561
You will not be alone
for so long as I Iive.

1288
01:43:46,523 --> 01:43:48,878
I m no better than a ruined tree.

1289
01:43:51,683 --> 01:43:54,675
I m Iightning struck
and decayed.

1290
01:43:55,123 --> 01:43:56,272
You re no ruin, sir.

1291
01:43:57,523 --> 01:43:59,479
You re vigorous
and full of Iife.

1292
01:44:01,683 --> 01:44:04,561
Plants will grow
and wind around you,

1293
01:44:05,363 --> 01:44:08,082
because your strength offers them
so safe a hold.

1294
01:44:26,763 --> 01:44:27,752
<i>And so...</i>

1295
01:44:28,683 --> 01:44:30,116
And so I married him.

1296
01:44:31,683 --> 01:44:33,321
Slowly but surely,

1297
01:44:33,523 --> 01:44:35,753
Edward began
to recover his sight.

1298
01:44:36,443 --> 01:44:39,037
When our first born
was put into his arms,

1299
01:44:39,243 --> 01:44:42,076
he could see the boy
had inherited his eyes

1300
01:44:42,443 --> 01:44:43,956
as they once were,

1301
01:44:44,523 --> 01:44:46,753
large and briIliant

1302
01:44:47,363 --> 01:44:48,921
and shining with Iife.

1303
01:44:50,443 --> 01:44:52,957
We sent for Adele,
she now Iives with us,

1304
01:44:53,163 --> 01:44:55,882
as beloved as if
she was our own daughter.

1305
01:44:57,603 --> 01:45:00,481
We are truly devoted,
my Edward and I.

1306
01:45:00,963 --> 01:45:02,760
Our hearts beat as one.

1307
01:45:03,363 --> 01:45:05,081
Our happiness is complete.

1308
01:45:06,081 --> 01:45:16,081
