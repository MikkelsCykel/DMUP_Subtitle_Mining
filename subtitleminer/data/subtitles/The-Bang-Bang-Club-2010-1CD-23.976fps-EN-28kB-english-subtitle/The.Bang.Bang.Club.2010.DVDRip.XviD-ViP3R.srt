apartheid government waged a secret war</b>

in the studio with me today

00:00:34,746 --> 00:00:37,130
award-winning photojournalist
Kevin Carter.

8
00:00:37,297 --> 00:00:40,634
We've read a lot
about the so called Bang Bang Club.

9
00:00:40,802 --> 00:00:43,637
Is there in fact such a club?

10
00:00:43,805 --> 00:00:46,640
Um, I mean, this, it's just a label.

11
00:00:46,808 --> 00:00:48,600
I mean, almost a joke really.

12
00:00:48,768 --> 00:00:52,230
Somebody called us that, and...
We go out together...

13
00:00:52,398 --> 00:00:53,940
on assignments

14
00:00:54,108 --> 00:00:55,150
and so we're always together.

15
00:00:55,317 --> 00:00:57,027
You know, safety in numbers.
That's the idea.

16
00:00:57,194 --> 00:00:59,529
And are you competitive
amongst yourselves?

17
00:00:59,697 --> 00:01:01,865
- I mean, do you compete?
- Oh yeah.

18

Everybody, at the end of the day,

19
00:01:04,118 --> 00:01:05,953
wants to come back with the best shot.

20
00:01:06,121 --> 00:01:10,791
So Kevin, what do you think
makes a photograph great?

21
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:12,668
Hmm...

Soweto residents say that
in the early hours of this morning,

27
00:01:49,834 --> 00:01:52,920
members of the Inkatha Freedom Party
attacked sections of Soweto,

known to be sympathetic to the ANC.

Armed with hangers and spears and
wearing their signature red headbands,

into a number of residential areas--

- Coming!

Are they going to give us money

Are they going to give us money

92

My brother was stopped by this comrade.

93
00:09:46,846 --> 00:09:50,516
He was from the shop,
carrying the plastic bag full of food.

94
00:09:50,684 --> 00:09:53,060
They told him that there was a boycott,

95
00:09:53,228 --> 00:09:56,522
so he should not go and buy food.

96
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:58,274
After that, you know what they did?

97
00:09:59,109 --> 00:10:02,028
They made him drink cooking oil
and paraffin

98
00:10:02,195 --> 00:10:05,574
and also they pushed
washing powder in his mouth.

99
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:22,216
What kind of a place is this

100

they tell their elders what to do?

101

I mean, what kind of a place is this

102
00:10:27,525 --> 00:10:30,224
where children do not
obey their parents?

103
00:10:30,267 --> 00:10:33,103
Today we taught them a very good lesson.

104

108
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:15,171
He's the enemy.
He's been shooting at everybody.

109
00:12:15,338 --> 00:12:18,133
I don't hear any shots.

110

Not a problem. Not a problem.

111

He's not Zulu.

112
00:14:14,383 --> 00:14:17,594

In the hostel? You don't mean inside?

124
00:15:50,861 --> 00:15:52,779
- Yeah, inside.
- Are you serious?

125
00:15:52,947 --> 00:15:54,156

130
00:16:04,751 --> 00:16:05,835

Ron, are you ever gonna grow some?

137
00:16:21,145 --> 00:16:24,981
We can use this one and this one

138

We don't get images like this every day.

139
00:16:27,818 --> 00:16:29,235
Yeah. All right. Maybe.

140
00:16:29,403 --> 00:16:31,154
Just show me a layout.

141
00:16:32,614 --> 00:16:34,450
The framing's weak.

142
00:16:34,617 --> 00:16:36,035
Half of them are soft.

143
00:16:36,202 --> 00:16:38,454

144
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:43,000
Greg, do you have a portfolio?

145
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:44,543
Sure.

146
00:16:44,711 --> 00:16:46,587
So which way did you get in, bru?

147
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:49,102
I could see where they were going
and I just followed them.

148
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:51,667
So did anyone stop you?
Were they cool with you?

149
00:16:51,735 --> 00:16:53,136
I thought they were
going to kill me, yeah,

150
00:16:53,304 --> 00:16:55,013
- but I could shoot for the most part.
- Fuck!

151
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:57,098
- It's not bad.
- Fucking Speen is back, man.

152
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:59,809
I was shooting some old time rituals.

153
00:17:01,813 --> 00:17:03,022
It's a circumcision ceremony there.

154
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:05,566
You shoot colour too, huh?

155
00:17:05,734 --> 00:17:08,527
Yeah, but this isn't the F64 club, bru.

156
00:17:08,695 --> 00:17:12,323
Yeah, what he means is our shit
doesn't sit still. Not like this.

157
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:15,035
I like this stuff.

158
00:17:15,203 --> 00:17:16,620
It's not bad.

159
00:17:16,788 --> 00:17:19,164
Okay, I'm out of here.

160
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:23,001
I think it's going to be better
if we go in earlier.

161
00:17:23,169 --> 00:17:25,295
Everybody else can sleep late
and file shit.

162
00:17:27,508 --> 00:17:28,633
I'll see you there, bru.

163
00:17:30,177 --> 00:17:32,553
- Cheers, Rob.
- Cheers.

00:17:36,183 --> 00:17:38,434
Joao. Joao Silva.

165
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,603
Pleasure.

166
00:17:40,771 --> 00:17:41,772
Well...

167
00:17:44,025 --> 00:17:47,402
- I told you to get in close, didn't I?
- You did, yeah.

168
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:50,364
Well done, bru. Well done.

169
00:17:50,532 --> 00:17:53,700
The, ah... the bill...
I don't have my wallet...

170
00:17:53,868 --> 00:17:55,703
- I got it, Kev, I got it.
- Thank you.

171
00:17:57,915 --> 00:18:00,583
Did I just get a job?

172
00:18:00,751 --> 00:18:02,752
No. Only Ken and Kevin are full-time.

173
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:06,714
But I'll give you the same deal as Joao.
On days that you work for us,

174
00:18:06,882 --> 00:18:09,051
I'll pay you a day rate.

175
00:18:09,219 --> 00:18:12,054
You get paid the same if we use
all of your pics or none of them.

176
00:18:12,222 --> 00:18:13,764
But you can sell
what we don't to AP or Reuters.

177
00:18:13,932 --> 00:18:16,684
That's where you make your real money.

178
00:18:16,852 --> 00:18:20,312
Here.It's for today's pics.

179
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,234
Shit.

180
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:28,738
Why did you go out there today?

181
00:18:28,906 --> 00:18:31,158
Because it scared me.

182
00:18:31,325 --> 00:18:34,745
Because it scared you?

183
00:18:34,913 --> 00:18:36,914
Do you always do things
just because they scare you?

184
00:18:37,082 --> 00:18:39,458
Not always, but sometimes.

185
00:18:42,921 --> 00:18:44,338
Can I buy you dinner?

186
00:18:46,258 --> 00:18:47,592
Can you afford to buy me dinner?

187
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:49,344
Oh, I can now.

188
00:18:51,598 --> 00:18:55,017
This time I'll buy you dinner. Use that
to buy yourself a better camera.

189
00:18:56,269 --> 00:18:59,271
We'll have to make it quick.
I have to be back at work in 40 minutes.

190
00:19:30,306 --> 00:19:32,178
Why don't you just get a new strap, bru?

191
00:19:32,367 --> 00:19:33,558
Because it's leather.

192
00:19:37,021 --> 00:19:39,314
I'm ready. I'm ready.

193
00:19:40,983 --> 00:19:42,693
The new guy.

194
00:19:42,861 --> 00:19:45,071
- How's it?
- New gear?

195
00:19:45,239 --> 00:19:47,657
- Yeah.
- Oh.

196
00:19:47,824 --> 00:19:49,659
Ready for some fun?

197
00:19:49,826 --> 00:19:51,744
One second.

198
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:56,166
It protects...

199
00:19:56,334 --> 00:20:00,963
the advance mechanism on the bottom.

200
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:04,007
I just saved you money on resale, bru.

201
00:20:04,175 --> 00:20:05,676
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

202
00:20:13,018 --> 00:20:14,143
How's it, Greg?

203
00:20:14,311 --> 00:20:15,270
How's it?

204
00:20:15,437 --> 00:20:16,604
- Nice camera, man.
- Thanks, bru.

205
00:20:16,772 --> 00:20:18,106
So what's the weather report?

206
00:20:18,274 --> 00:20:19,899
They say there's
about 2,000 Inkatha warriors

207
00:20:20,067 --> 00:20:21,192
two clicks from here.

208
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,695
They're heavily armed.
They're on their way to the comrades.

209
00:20:22,862 --> 00:20:23,904
Let's go.

210
00:20:24,072 --> 00:20:25,906
- Yeah.
- Let's go!

211
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:36,209
Hey, Joao, is that a fucking scanner?

212
00:20:36,377 --> 00:20:37,585
Yeah.

213
00:20:37,753 --> 00:20:39,462
You're a criminal degenerate,
you know that?

214
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:41,172
If the cops catch us with that,

215
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,216
- they'll put us in fucking jail, man.
- Well if they stop us,

216
00:20:43,384 --> 00:20:46,636
- it belongs to the new guy.
- Thanks.

217
00:20:46,804 --> 00:20:48,263
It's down there.

218
00:20:48,431 --> 00:20:49,890
Right there.

219
00:20:50,058 --> 00:20:52,018
Ah, what have we got here?

220
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:04,740
This is fun.

221
00:21:04,907 --> 00:21:06,950
Just smile and be cool.

222
00:21:08,661 --> 00:21:10,662
Press on foot. Press.

223
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:12,748
It's press, eh?

224
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:15,167
Press on foot.

225
00:21:15,335 --> 00:21:16,753
Press.

226
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:21,716
- Press, eh? Press.
- They're using muti.

227
00:21:23,719 --> 00:21:25,303
They think it makes them invulnerable.

228
00:21:28,015 --> 00:21:30,601
That's where they are, on the right.

229
00:21:30,769 --> 00:21:32,895
- Ah, shit. Here they come.
- All right.

230
00:21:33,063 --> 00:21:35,064
- Just park on the right there.
- Yeah.

231
00:21:38,234 --> 00:21:39,943
Okay. Here we go.

232
00:21:56,782 --> 00:22:00,363
<b>Khumalo Street, Thokoza Township</b>

233
00:22:17,819 --> 00:22:18,985
You ready?

234
00:22:19,153 --> 00:22:20,404
- Yeah.
- Are you sure?

235
00:22:20,571 --> 00:22:21,863
Yeah.

236
00:22:39,968 --> 00:22:42,010
Watch him.

237
00:22:42,178 --> 00:22:43,846
It's all about reading the moment.

238
00:22:46,558 --> 00:22:48,350
Watch him, man. He's the best.

239
00:22:49,519 --> 00:22:51,187
He always works from the outside in.

240
00:22:59,989 --> 00:23:01,614
And when it peaks...

241
00:23:06,246 --> 00:23:07,288
You're there.

242
00:23:09,124 --> 00:23:11,417
It's a thing of beauty, my friend.

243
00:23:12,502 --> 00:23:14,879
Then, you shoot a black frame.

244
00:23:15,714 --> 00:23:18,717
That just simply tells the desk
that's your best shot.

245
00:23:20,595 --> 00:23:23,930
Let's go find one ourselves. Huh?

246
00:23:50,335 --> 00:23:52,085
That's an army-issue R1 .

247
00:23:53,004 --> 00:23:55,088
Where the fuck are they
getting the guns?

248
00:23:55,256 --> 00:23:57,633
What the fuck do you care, man?
It doesn't matter.

249
00:23:57,801 --> 00:23:58,968
Just take the picture.

250
00:24:16,029 --> 00:24:18,989
I guess the muti isn't working so well
this morning.

251
00:24:19,157 --> 00:24:21,450
They still think it's working fine,
just not for them.

252
00:25:54,051 --> 00:25:55,926
Go.

253
00:26:31,841 --> 00:26:33,592
Can't you at least pretend to be scared?

254
00:27:30,821 --> 00:27:32,029
Cool.

255
00:27:41,791 --> 00:27:43,208
Hiya

256
00:27:47,673 --> 00:27:50,383
Come, let's grab a drink.
Let's get a drink.

257
00:27:58,517 --> 00:27:59,851
Joao!

258
00:28:02,189 --> 00:28:04,231
Hi, I'm Viv. You must be Greg.

259
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:05,691
Yeah, hi.

260
00:28:05,859 --> 00:28:09,195
So you decided to join up
with these crazies, eh?

261
00:28:09,362 --> 00:28:12,114
Ken!

262
00:28:12,282 --> 00:28:13,325
I want you meet someone.

263
00:28:15,286 --> 00:28:16,661
So is this the young man?

264
00:28:16,829 --> 00:28:19,206
Greg, this is Alf Khumalo.

265
00:28:19,373 --> 00:28:21,208
It's really nice to meet you, sir.
It's an honor.

266
00:28:21,375 --> 00:28:23,084
I know your photographs well.

267
00:28:23,252 --> 00:28:24,878
How are you feeling with our big chief?

268
00:28:25,046 --> 00:28:27,673
You're not gonna tell him
what a racist bastard I am, are you?

269
00:28:27,841 --> 00:28:31,219
Well, you still young, Ken,
you'll get over it, you know.

270
00:28:31,386 --> 00:28:33,471
So Ken, another whitey photographer
making money

271
00:28:33,639 --> 00:28:35,765
off the spilled blood of Africans, eh?

272
00:28:36,141 --> 00:28:38,392
Ah, Sonny. Cool it.

273
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:43,649
Let him be.

274
00:28:43,817 --> 00:28:45,192
Fuck it. I'm too thirsty
to have this argument.

275
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:49,696
Promised this oke a drink.
Alf, Sonny, Thoko.

276
00:28:49,864 --> 00:28:50,405
Cheers.

277
00:28:50,573 --> 00:28:52,825
- See you guys later.
- Welcome, Greg.

278
00:28:52,992 --> 00:28:54,160
Thanks, sir.

279
00:28:55,913 --> 00:28:57,247
Two beers, please.

280
00:28:57,414 --> 00:28:59,916
Whew, what was that about?

281
00:29:01,252 --> 00:29:02,794
Ah, it's much harder
if you're a black photographer.

282
00:29:02,962 --> 00:29:04,254
- Here you go.
- There you go, bru.

283
00:29:04,421 --> 00:29:05,421
Thanks.

284
00:29:05,589 --> 00:29:08,968
If you're an Inkatha supporter,
the ANC comrades want to kill you.

285
00:29:09,135 --> 00:29:11,595
If you're ANC,
the Inkatha Zulus want to kill you.

286
00:29:11,763 --> 00:29:13,055
So really, there's always somebody

287
00:29:13,223 --> 00:29:15,307
who wants to kill you.
Doesn't matter whose side you're on.

288
00:29:15,475 --> 00:29:17,685
And you...

289
00:29:17,853 --> 00:29:19,395
You're lucky 'cause you're white.

290
00:29:19,563 --> 00:29:21,439
As you've shown,

291
00:29:21,607 --> 00:29:24,192
you can go anywhere.

292
00:29:24,986 --> 00:29:26,987
School's out, china. Let's drink.

293
00:29:27,154 --> 00:29:29,114
- Cheers, man.
- Cheers!

294
00:29:30,783 --> 00:29:32,534
You're Ken Oosterbroek, aren't you?

295
00:29:32,702 --> 00:29:33,618
Yeah.

296
00:29:33,786 --> 00:29:35,371
- Hi.
- Hi.

297
00:29:40,961 --> 00:29:43,629
This is Greg. Greg, Sam.

298
00:29:43,797 --> 00:29:44,839
Pleasure.

299
00:31:02,715 --> 00:31:04,716
It's Kevin's.

300
00:31:05,927 --> 00:31:07,678
- It's great.
- Yeah.

301
00:31:07,845 --> 00:31:10,264
Come and see this.

302
00:31:12,726 --> 00:31:15,144
I'm calling it Our Hidden War.

303
00:31:17,314 --> 00:31:19,065
These are the shots I'm gonna use.

304
00:31:20,359 --> 00:31:22,653
Three of them are yours.

305
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:27,741
Shit.

306
00:31:32,414 --> 00:31:33,497
You should use this one too.

307
00:31:33,665 --> 00:31:35,583
Hands off.

308
00:31:35,751 --> 00:31:37,585
And, ah... that one.

309
00:31:37,753 --> 00:31:39,337
Stop. Stop it.

310
00:31:40,589 --> 00:31:43,758
- They'll never let you run this.
- They have to.

311
00:31:43,926 --> 00:31:46,052
These pictures are gonna show up
on front pages all over the world.

312
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:49,140
We'll look like idiots
if we don't use them ourselves.

313
00:31:49,307 --> 00:31:51,934
We don't know
what the government will do.

314
00:31:53,228 --> 00:31:55,021
We have no idea
what we can get away with.

315
00:31:55,188 --> 00:32:00,109
Oh, so you want to see
what you can get away with?

316
00:32:01,653 --> 00:32:04,781
You're a fucking troublemaker,
you know that?

317
00:32:06,451 --> 00:32:08,618
- Is it?
- Yeah.

318
00:32:10,121 --> 00:32:11,621
I don't date photographers.

319
00:32:11,789 --> 00:32:14,708
Yeah?

320
00:32:14,876 --> 00:32:16,169
You keep terrible hours,

321
00:32:16,336 --> 00:32:20,465
you drink too much and you're crazy.

322
00:32:21,467 --> 00:32:23,843
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

323
00:32:24,011 --> 00:32:26,137
And then there's some bad stuff too.

324
00:32:59,883 --> 00:33:04,845
Not too much to report
but anger and pain

325
00:33:05,013 --> 00:33:07,014
and thinking, "Where's the way out?"

326
00:33:08,183 --> 00:33:10,185
How do we get out of this mess?

327
00:33:13,356 --> 00:33:16,608
Bloody little daylight in the daylight,
if you catch my drift.

328
00:33:16,776 --> 00:33:20,028
But tonight, my brus,

329
00:33:20,196 --> 00:33:22,531
tonight the moon is high.

330
00:33:22,698 --> 00:33:26,035
You can see the new century
coming towards us

331
00:33:26,203 --> 00:33:31,541
and it sounds like this.

332
00:34:02,741 --> 00:34:04,493
You don't tell anyone about this.

333
00:34:09,166 --> 00:34:12,585
She knows what she's doing.
Anyway, it's about time.

334
00:34:12,752 --> 00:34:16,422
You know, I always thought
it was gonna be me.

335
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:19,426
Kev, it was never gonna be you, man.

336
00:34:19,594 --> 00:34:21,595
But Robin and the new guy?

337
00:34:23,264 --> 00:34:24,514
Yeah, the new guy.

338
00:34:26,601 --> 00:34:28,018
- How's it?
- How's it?

339
00:34:28,186 --> 00:34:29,311
Yeah. How's it?!

340
00:34:29,478 --> 00:34:30,897
- Out with it!
- Come on!

341
00:34:31,064 --> 00:34:33,107
- What? What?
- Sex with Robin.

342
00:34:33,275 --> 00:34:35,342
Okay, we make you join our little club
and then...

343
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,918
You're in the club now.

344
00:34:37,068 --> 00:34:38,362
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

345
00:35:42,349 --> 00:35:44,183
You're mad.

346
00:35:44,351 --> 00:35:45,977
There's cops in there.

347
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:51,441
Go on,

348
00:35:51,609 --> 00:35:53,860
they're too shit scared to much.

349
00:35:54,696 --> 00:35:56,697
Believe me.

350
00:35:57,573 --> 00:35:58,973
Jesus ...

351
00:35:59,715 --> 00:36:02,021
That's marijuana!
Just down there, by the wheel.

352
00:36:03,045 --> 00:36:04,622
Hey! You outside!

353
00:36:05,616 --> 00:36:07,656
Hey man! Put out that joint!

354
00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:13,337
There's a guy down here
smoking a fucking joint!

355
00:36:16,468 --> 00:36:17,677
It's marijuana!

356
00:36:28,878 --> 00:36:33,074
<b>Inhlazane Station - Soweto Township</b>

357
00:36:35,364 --> 00:36:39,743
Did you catch my show last night?

358
00:36:40,453 --> 00:36:45,082
Every... fucking cut, every one.

359
00:36:48,086 --> 00:36:50,254
Stones, every cut.

360
00:36:50,422 --> 00:36:51,756
Kevin, do you ever sleep?

361
00:36:51,923 --> 00:36:54,925
Can you believe it?
Can you fucking believe it?

362
00:36:55,093 --> 00:36:57,261
Kev, shut up.

363
00:37:20,871 --> 00:37:21,954
Shadows.

364
00:37:56,076 --> 00:37:59,120
- Fuck!
- What's wrong?

365
00:38:01,998 --> 00:38:04,333
I thought he was still alive.

366
00:38:05,210 --> 00:38:08,713
He's dead. It's just a body spasm.

367
00:38:11,592 --> 00:38:13,844
Kev, if you've got the shot,
move on, man.

368
00:39:34,223 --> 00:39:35,181
Ugh!

369
00:39:40,605 --> 00:39:43,315
- Who is he?
- He's Inkatha.

370
00:39:43,483 --> 00:39:45,400
- Are you sure?
- He's Zulu.

371
00:39:45,568 --> 00:39:47,319
Yeah he's Zulu,
but how do you know he's Inkatha?

372
00:39:47,487 --> 00:39:49,196
We know him. We are sure.

373
00:39:49,364 --> 00:39:51,949
Ugh! Ugh!

374
00:40:04,004 --> 00:40:05,129
Stop it! Stop!

375
00:40:05,297 --> 00:40:06,757
Stop taking pictures.

376
00:40:06,925 --> 00:40:08,717
Yeah, I'll stop taking pictures
when you stop killing him.

377
00:40:08,885 --> 00:40:10,219
You saw what they did to us.

378
00:40:10,387 --> 00:40:12,429
- What if he's not guilty?
- Doesn't matter.

379
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:21,731
It will be a warning for the next ones.

380
00:40:45,173 --> 00:40:46,799
Greg, behind you!

381
00:40:48,886 --> 00:40:50,470
Greg!

382
00:40:50,638 --> 00:40:52,764
Get out of there!

383
00:41:26,343 --> 00:41:29,304
Oh fuck. Oh fuck.

384
00:41:35,603 --> 00:41:37,395
He's burning. He's burning.

385
00:41:39,565 --> 00:41:43,736
So I ran after him.
The sun was right behind him.

386
00:41:44,738 --> 00:41:49,158
Didn't have time to check my meter,
so I press the button.

387
00:41:49,326 --> 00:41:51,744
I just kept thinking F 5.6, F 5.6.

388
00:41:53,163 --> 00:41:55,582
I started to frame for my next shot.

389
00:41:55,750 --> 00:41:58,752
Just then, this guy runs up
with a fucking panga...

390
00:42:00,254 --> 00:42:02,381
and brings it down on his head.

391
00:42:07,261 --> 00:42:08,346
You're shaking.

392
00:42:10,099 --> 00:42:12,517
But at least I've got the pictures.

393
00:42:15,437 --> 00:42:17,855
Greg you know we're not going to be able
to use the pictures.

394
00:42:18,023 --> 00:42:19,421
They're too graphic.

395
00:42:19,830 --> 00:42:21,568
Then what the fuck am I doing out there?

396
00:42:21,736 --> 00:42:24,279
- It wasn't my call.
- Yeah, I know, but fuck!

397
00:42:26,032 --> 00:42:27,032
Ah, there he is!

398
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,283
There's the little fucker.

399
00:42:28,451 --> 00:42:30,494
It was fucking mal out there today, huh?

400
00:42:30,662 --> 00:42:32,663
Okay.

401
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:34,415
Tell him.

402
00:42:34,583 --> 00:42:36,543
I sent your pictures to AP,
they sent it to London.

403
00:42:36,711 --> 00:42:39,212
They wanted every fucking shot
you took today.

404
00:42:39,379 --> 00:42:40,797
- Do you know what that means?
- What?

405
00:42:40,965 --> 00:42:43,641
Your shots all over the world.

406
00:42:44,308 --> 00:42:45,510
- You're joking.
- It's payday, buddy.

407
00:42:45,678 --> 00:42:47,637
- A joke...
- Money! Money, baby!

408
00:42:47,805 --> 00:42:50,182
- Yes! Woo!
- Yes! Greg!

409
00:42:50,350 --> 00:42:52,476
You did it!

410
00:43:20,841 --> 00:43:21,966
Robin Comly.

411
00:43:25,179 --> 00:43:27,472
Robin Comly, is she here?

412
00:43:30,185 --> 00:43:31,602
Yes.

413
00:43:31,770 --> 00:43:34,897
- I'm Robin.
- I'm looking for Greg Marinovich.

414
00:43:36,357 --> 00:43:38,066
What do you want him for?

415
00:43:38,234 --> 00:43:40,986
He has taken a photograph of a crime.
I want him and the rolls of film.

416
00:43:41,154 --> 00:43:43,490
Greg is freelance. He comes and goes.

417
00:43:43,657 --> 00:43:46,451
And we didn't use
this particular picture,

418
00:43:46,619 --> 00:43:48,036
so I don't think we can help you.

419
00:43:48,204 --> 00:43:49,829
A crime was committed.

420
00:43:49,997 --> 00:43:51,080
A man brutally murdered.

421
00:43:51,248 --> 00:43:54,083
We intend to obtain his photographs
and identify the perpetrators.

422
00:43:54,251 --> 00:43:55,961
I have here a 205 subpoena

423
00:43:56,129 --> 00:43:59,173
which compels Mr. Marinovich
to testify or face arrest.

424
00:44:00,550 --> 00:44:03,552
By law, you must sign
to acknowledge receipt.

425
00:44:09,143 --> 00:44:10,894
Make sure he gets it.

426
00:44:19,028 --> 00:44:20,445
- Shit.
- We've got no choice.

427
00:44:20,613 --> 00:44:23,533
We have to notify the police
that we've seen you.

428
00:44:24,451 --> 00:44:25,451
Are you okay?

429
00:44:25,619 --> 00:44:27,745
- I don't know, bru.
- What you gonna do?

430
00:44:27,913 --> 00:44:29,705
I'm not fucking testifying.

431
00:44:29,873 --> 00:44:32,250
I mean, I don't like what they did,
but I'm not fucking helping the cops.

432
00:44:32,417 --> 00:44:33,543
Just give them the photographs.

433
00:44:33,710 --> 00:44:35,629
- Fuck that.
- What do you want to be a hero for?

434
00:44:39,926 --> 00:44:41,885
There's only one reason
why he shouldn't.

435
00:44:42,053 --> 00:44:45,430
If he gives them the photographs
and if he testifies,

436
00:44:45,598 --> 00:44:48,600
the next day, in every township,
on every street, we're all targets.

437
00:44:50,104 --> 00:44:51,980
We'll have taken sides.

438
00:44:57,611 --> 00:44:59,654
I think you should make yourself scarce
for a while.

439
00:46:18,031 --> 00:46:19,323
Hi.

440
00:46:19,491 --> 00:46:22,868
Came off the telex 10 minutes ago.
It's a Pulitzer.

441
00:46:23,036 --> 00:46:24,037
You're joking?

442
00:46:24,205 --> 00:46:27,624
- No, I'm not.
- They can't arrest him now.

443
00:46:27,792 --> 00:46:30,126
- Too much publicity.
- Well, do you know where he is?

444
00:46:30,294 --> 00:46:31,211
Yeah.

445
00:46:31,379 --> 00:46:33,129
So what are you waiting for?
Give him a call.

446
00:46:37,886 --> 00:46:39,720
Yeah!

447
00:46:42,599 --> 00:46:45,935
- Another one for Greg! Pulitzer boy!
- Yeah!

448
00:46:47,062 --> 00:46:48,521
Woo!

449
00:46:51,067 --> 00:46:54,569
- Yes!
- Go, Kev! Kev, Kev, Kev, Kev!

450
00:46:56,739 --> 00:46:58,740
Thank you...

451
00:46:58,908 --> 00:47:01,410
Listen, can I, can I,
can I say a couple of words?

452
00:47:02,829 --> 00:47:04,288
Hello?

453
00:47:04,456 --> 00:47:07,250
I just-I just want to say
a couple of words.

454
00:47:07,418 --> 00:47:08,918
I'm Ronald Graham,

455
00:47:09,086 --> 00:47:12,296
and for those of you who don't know,
I'm the editor of The Star.

456
00:47:12,464 --> 00:47:14,549
And I just want to add my...

457
00:47:14,717 --> 00:47:19,221
I'd just like to add my voice
to the congratulations for Greg.

458
00:47:19,389 --> 00:47:22,016
You know, winning a Pulitzer
is no small thing.

459
00:47:23,184 --> 00:47:25,936
You know we are very,
very proud of Greg.

460
00:47:26,104 --> 00:47:27,312
Even though we weren't

461
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:28,939
the people who published the photos
in the first place.

462
00:47:29,107 --> 00:47:30,650
Big mistake!

463
00:47:30,818 --> 00:47:33,028
Oops! It's our mistake.

464
00:47:33,195 --> 00:47:35,238
Your mistake.

465
00:47:35,406 --> 00:47:37,657
But I think we're forgiven
because Greg is here tonight.

466
00:47:37,825 --> 00:47:39,409
Actually, you know, Greg,
when you, ah...

467
00:47:39,577 --> 00:47:41,202
When you went off to New York
to collect your prize,

468
00:47:41,370 --> 00:47:43,580
a lot of us thought you weren't
gonna come back again,

469
00:47:43,748 --> 00:47:45,458
but here you are.

470
00:47:45,625 --> 00:47:48,252
I had to come back, Ronnie.
There's no bang bang over there.

471
00:47:50,297 --> 00:47:53,007
Congratulations! It's well deserved!

472
00:47:53,175 --> 00:47:54,383
Woo!

473
00:47:59,223 --> 00:48:00,974
So, congratulations, Greg.
That was awesome.

474
00:48:01,142 --> 00:48:03,268
Oh, thank you. I appreciate that.

475
00:48:03,436 --> 00:48:05,353
Ah, fuck, Greg. Screw your award.

476
00:48:05,521 --> 00:48:07,898
Your fucking photograph,
it's everywhere.

477
00:48:08,066 --> 00:48:09,858
The government is using it to show

478
00:48:10,026 --> 00:48:13,071
how we animals cannot govern ourselves.
How the fuck do you like that?

479
00:48:13,238 --> 00:48:15,281
- Sonny, leave it.
- Even the ANC says

480
00:48:15,449 --> 00:48:18,701
it's a white man's photo
taken for white man's purposes.

481
00:48:18,869 --> 00:48:21,746
- Sonny, it's not his fault.
- Is that what you think?

482
00:48:23,082 --> 00:48:26,960
- Let him enjoy his moment, man.
- Sonny, is that what you think?

483
00:48:28,838 --> 00:48:30,339
Forgive him, Greg.

484
00:48:52,864 --> 00:48:54,198
You okay?

485
00:48:54,366 --> 00:48:56,826
No. No.

486
00:48:58,787 --> 00:49:01,705
Greg, I, I keep having this dream

487
00:49:01,873 --> 00:49:04,166
and in it, I'm dying.

488
00:49:05,211 --> 00:49:06,878
I think you've had
one pint too many, bru.

489
00:49:07,046 --> 00:49:09,214
No, it's... I'm getting...

490
00:49:10,466 --> 00:49:11,675
I'm getting crucified

491
00:49:11,843 --> 00:49:14,261
and there's this big fucking lens

492
00:49:14,428 --> 00:49:16,471
that just keeps zooming in on me.

493
00:49:16,639 --> 00:49:18,224
- Yeah?
- Yeah!

494
00:49:19,226 --> 00:49:20,309
It's just a dream, Kev.

495
00:49:21,562 --> 00:49:24,730
I wake up screaming my head off.

496
00:49:24,898 --> 00:49:26,107
Kev...

497
00:49:26,275 --> 00:49:27,859
What am I supposed to say?

498
00:49:28,026 --> 00:49:29,902
I don't know.

499
00:49:33,741 --> 00:49:35,409
Maybe you need to see a doctor.

500
00:49:35,577 --> 00:49:38,829
Yeah, yeah.

501
00:49:39,122 --> 00:49:40,308
You're just reading
into everything, huh?

502
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:41,603
Yeah, that's what I do.

503
00:49:42,638 --> 00:49:44,251
Let's get out of here.

504
00:49:44,419 --> 00:49:46,004
- Sure. Now?
- Yeah.

505
00:49:47,256 --> 00:49:49,966
- All right. We're going.
- Cheers.

506
00:49:50,134 --> 00:49:51,801
Cheers.

507
00:49:52,511 --> 00:49:54,429
You know, he didn't know what it was.

508
00:49:54,597 --> 00:49:56,931
I heard they had to tell him
what a Pulitzer was.

509
00:49:58,267 --> 00:49:59,685
It's dumb luck.

510
00:49:59,853 --> 00:50:02,688
Ask me, Ken. I'll tell you.
Pure dumb luck.

511
00:50:04,608 --> 00:50:06,609
Yeah, Jimmy.

512
00:50:08,612 --> 00:50:09,862
You just have the sheer bloody luck

513
00:50:10,030 --> 00:50:11,947
to find yourself ten feet away
from a burning man.

514
00:50:13,284 --> 00:50:16,286
Luckily, you're just two feet away
from an oke with a knife,

515
00:50:16,454 --> 00:50:18,288
taking swipes at the back of your neck.

516
00:50:19,957 --> 00:50:22,959
I mean, you'd be sure to keep your eye
nailed to your viewfinder, right?

517
00:50:23,127 --> 00:50:25,880
You check your F-stop,
used for a wall of flame.

518
00:50:26,048 --> 00:50:27,298
Right?

519
00:50:29,635 --> 00:50:31,302
So when you're that lucky,

520
00:50:32,387 --> 00:50:33,971
come see me.

521
00:50:35,724 --> 00:50:39,937
And we can talk about whether
Greg Marinovich deserves a Pulitzer.

522
00:50:41,314 --> 00:50:42,439
I'm just saying, Ken.

523
00:50:53,410 --> 00:50:55,328
It was a great night.

524
00:50:56,455 --> 00:50:59,958
I was really surprised
by Ronald's speech.

525
00:51:00,125 --> 00:51:02,335
I really didn't expect him
to do that.

526
00:51:04,004 --> 00:51:05,797
Ah, okay.

527
00:51:19,187 --> 00:51:20,689
Okay.

528
00:51:21,941 --> 00:51:22,941
Greg.

529
00:51:24,986 --> 00:51:27,112
Slow down. Slow down.

530
00:51:28,656 --> 00:51:30,073
Greg.

531
00:51:30,241 --> 00:51:32,075
Greg, stop. Greg.

532
00:51:32,243 --> 00:51:33,786
Greg. Stop.

533
00:51:33,954 --> 00:51:36,914
Greg, stop it. Stop it!
What's wrong with you?

534
00:51:37,082 --> 00:51:39,041
Nothing.

535
00:51:39,209 --> 00:51:42,295
Doesn't seem like nothing.

536
00:51:46,551 --> 00:51:47,509
I'm sorry.

537
00:51:49,554 --> 00:51:51,722
It's all fucked up.

538
00:51:53,391 --> 00:51:54,725
I win this prize

539
00:51:54,892 --> 00:51:58,687
and then the ANC publicly accuses me
of being a state spy.

540
00:51:58,855 --> 00:52:01,649
I fucking hate them all.

541
00:52:01,817 --> 00:52:03,192
All of them.

542
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:06,279
The... Inkatha, the comrades,
this place.

543
00:52:06,447 --> 00:52:08,489
- I fucking hate it all!
- Greg.

544
00:52:08,657 --> 00:52:10,908
Greg.

545
00:52:11,076 --> 00:52:14,413
It's okay.

546
00:52:18,418 --> 00:52:19,585
Okay.

547
00:52:25,425 --> 00:52:26,383
Hey.

548
00:52:26,551 --> 00:52:27,761
I'm Kevin.

549
00:52:27,928 --> 00:52:30,138
I know who you are.

550
00:52:30,306 --> 00:52:32,057
You do? Shit.

551
00:52:33,601 --> 00:52:35,101
My own mother
doesn't even know who I am.

552
00:52:36,937 --> 00:52:38,938
Um...

553
00:52:39,106 --> 00:52:40,399
You're one of those photographers

554
00:52:40,567 --> 00:52:42,151
who takes the pictures?

555
00:52:42,319 --> 00:52:43,944
Yeah, I am.

556
00:52:44,112 --> 00:52:45,821
I really like your pictures.

557
00:52:45,989 --> 00:52:48,115
Thank you.

558
00:52:48,283 --> 00:52:50,534
Are you a... are you a journalist?

559
00:52:52,204 --> 00:52:53,663
No, I'm-I'm a teacher.

560
00:52:55,458 --> 00:52:56,500
A teacher?

561
00:52:58,795 --> 00:53:02,297
Listen, um, my chinas and me,

562
00:53:02,465 --> 00:53:04,549
we're having a braai on Sunday.

563
00:53:04,717 --> 00:53:06,635
Okay.

564
00:53:06,803 --> 00:53:08,471
Would you come?

565
00:53:09,932 --> 00:53:11,766
I mean, your friends

566
00:53:11,934 --> 00:53:14,977
are-are more than welcome
to-to join... It'll...

567
00:53:15,145 --> 00:53:17,355
- I'd love that.
- Yes?

568
00:53:17,523 --> 00:53:20,943
- Yes.
- Okay.

569
00:53:27,951 --> 00:53:29,493
Here.

570
00:53:30,245 --> 00:53:32,246
Let's try this again.

571
00:53:36,335 --> 00:53:37,627
Cheers.

572
00:53:37,795 --> 00:53:39,838
Cheers.

573
00:53:48,515 --> 00:53:51,517
Greg, it's a great picture.

574
00:53:54,521 --> 00:53:56,021
Yeah.

575
00:53:57,524 --> 00:53:59,442
It is.

576
00:54:03,197 --> 00:54:06,199
You know, sometimes I think
about doing something else.

577
00:54:09,203 --> 00:54:10,704
I'm not sure I believe you.

578
00:54:10,872 --> 00:54:13,123
I'm not sure I'm telling the truth.

579
00:54:45,576 --> 00:54:46,659
Oh!

580
00:55:03,303 --> 00:55:04,512
- No!
- No?

581
00:55:20,112 --> 00:55:21,446
Ah!

582
00:55:28,497 --> 00:55:30,915
Fucking butchery this morning.

583
00:55:31,083 --> 00:55:33,209
I really like this one.

584
00:55:33,377 --> 00:55:35,087
She's not going to last
more than a week anyway.

585
00:55:36,965 --> 00:55:38,882
Hey, Joao, fuck you.

586
00:55:39,050 --> 00:55:41,677
What the fuck?

587
00:55:41,844 --> 00:55:44,346
Ken, come check this.

588
00:55:44,514 --> 00:55:46,056
We've just done a layout over here.

589
00:55:46,224 --> 00:55:48,560
It's a story about you guys.
You're going to love it, it's great.

590
00:55:48,727 --> 00:55:50,186
There's no way you're printing this.

591
00:55:50,354 --> 00:55:51,729
What, bru?

592
00:55:51,897 --> 00:55:53,231
We're not fucking paparazzi.

593
00:55:55,401 --> 00:55:56,776
Come on, you kind of are.

594
00:55:56,944 --> 00:55:58,987
Fuck you, man.
It's like saying we're fucking hyenas.

595
00:55:59,154 --> 00:56:02,424
No, no, look, it's a really
positive story about you guys, okay?

596
00:56:02,492 --> 00:56:05,619
Take it out, you fucking wanker,
or I'll take you out.

597
00:56:06,997 --> 00:56:08,581
He's right, bru.

598
00:56:08,748 --> 00:56:10,624
- Take it out.
- All right, all right, Joao.

599
00:56:10,792 --> 00:56:13,335
What about club?

600
00:56:14,671 --> 00:56:15,672
The Bang Bang Club?

601
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:18,717
That's so fucking lame.

602
00:56:18,884 --> 00:56:21,261
No, club's fine.

603
00:56:22,638 --> 00:56:25,932
Leave it in.
Sam, can you please get the plates?

604
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:28,018
I'm going to.

605
00:56:29,521 --> 00:56:32,356
Long have we awaited...

606
00:56:32,524 --> 00:56:35,026
- Bye, all. Thanks, Sam.
- Cheers.

607
00:56:38,113 --> 00:56:40,197
Ciao, Viv.

608
00:56:40,365 --> 00:56:43,201
Cheers.

609
00:56:43,369 --> 00:56:45,287
Excuse me, sir? Hello.

610
00:56:45,455 --> 00:56:48,832
I'm Abdul Shareef.
I'm a photographer as well and...

611
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,627
I'm just trying to find out
how do I join this Bang Bang Club.

612
00:56:51,794 --> 00:56:53,962
Just tell him it's fucking full.

613
00:56:55,048 --> 00:56:57,216
There's no club, man.

614
00:57:01,889 --> 00:57:04,057
You know the Macho Chicken
just off Old Potch Road?

615
00:57:04,224 --> 00:57:05,808
Yes sir, I can find it.

616
00:57:05,976 --> 00:57:08,186
Well if you turn up there one morning,
who knows.

617
00:57:08,354 --> 00:57:09,605
Thank you.

618
00:57:09,773 --> 00:57:12,191
Thank you.

619
00:57:12,359 --> 00:57:13,692
You were very nice to that guy.

620
00:57:13,860 --> 00:57:15,986
Not long ago I was that guy.

621
00:57:23,954 --> 00:57:25,538
Morning, my chinas.

622
00:57:25,706 --> 00:57:27,457
- How's it, bru?
- Morning.

623
00:57:27,625 --> 00:57:30,418
- Hey what's with all the journos?
- Greg. Morning.

624
00:57:30,586 --> 00:57:32,295
- Thanks.
- Ah, them?

625
00:57:32,463 --> 00:57:34,381
Yeah, they've been here every morning
the past week.

626
00:57:34,548 --> 00:57:35,715
Waiting.

627
00:57:35,883 --> 00:57:39,595
Yeah, I've been getting phone calls
about this fucking Bang Bang Club shit.

628
00:57:39,763 --> 00:57:41,752
Some Frenchman called me from Paris.

629
00:57:42,025 --> 00:57:43,224
Wants to know
how he can become a member.

630
00:57:43,392 --> 00:57:44,809
- What?
- No shit.

631
00:57:44,976 --> 00:57:46,435
- Yeah.
- Hey, bru.

632
00:57:46,603 --> 00:57:49,021
- Hey!
- Who's this?

633
00:57:49,189 --> 00:57:51,441
It's Abdul.
I told him he could ride along.

634
00:57:52,985 --> 00:57:55,153
Greg's been picking up stompies.

635
00:57:55,321 --> 00:57:57,823
- Come on.
- Kevin.

636
00:57:57,990 --> 00:58:00,951
- Abdul. Nice to meet you.
- Let's go, Kev.

637
00:58:04,456 --> 00:58:06,624
What the fuck?

638
00:58:06,792 --> 00:58:09,001
They're following us in.

639
00:58:09,169 --> 00:58:10,545
Come on man, fuck this shit.

640
00:58:13,006 --> 00:58:15,425
Ah... What's he doin'?

641
00:58:16,636 --> 00:58:18,011
Hey, assholes!

642
00:58:18,179 --> 00:58:19,680
You make me fucking sick!

643
00:58:19,848 --> 00:58:21,432
Find your own fucking bang bang!

644
00:58:21,599 --> 00:58:23,350
Sure...

645
00:58:24,728 --> 00:58:26,311
Hey.

646
00:58:26,479 --> 00:58:28,772
- Who else did you tell about
this place? - Nobody.

647
00:58:28,940 --> 00:58:31,651
- Don't fuck with me, man.
- Seriously, nobody.

648
00:58:31,819 --> 00:58:34,320
- How many people did you tell?
- It's not his fault.

649
00:58:34,488 --> 00:58:36,823
It's not his fault, Joao.
They followed us in.

650
00:58:39,660 --> 00:58:41,661
Ah, okay, man.

651
00:58:58,881 --> 00:59:01,984
<b>Nancefield, Soweto Township</b>

652
00:59:06,856 --> 00:59:08,648
Greg. Look down there.

653
00:59:40,142 --> 00:59:41,851
Get down! Get down!
The Zulus are over there, get down!

654
00:59:42,019 --> 00:59:43,520
- What's happening?
- There's no shooting.

655
00:59:43,687 --> 00:59:46,189
They got a sniper with a silencer.
Get down.

656
00:59:46,357 --> 00:59:48,107
Get down!

657
00:59:48,275 --> 00:59:49,901
Ah!

658
00:59:50,069 --> 00:59:51,445
He's been hit!

659
00:59:51,613 --> 00:59:53,072
Shit!

660
00:59:54,407 --> 00:59:56,283
Here! Here, here, here, here!

661
00:59:56,451 --> 00:59:57,493
Oh fuck!

662
00:59:57,661 --> 00:59:58,786
- Is he dead?
- How the fuck do I know?

663
00:59:58,954 --> 01:00:01,080
He's breathing. I think he's breathing.

664
01:00:01,248 --> 01:00:03,457
Fuck! I told him he could come.

665
01:00:03,625 --> 01:00:06,253
He wanted to come, man. He wanted in.

666
01:00:06,420 --> 01:00:08,091
Now you see
what we go through every day.

667
01:00:08,262 --> 01:00:09,205
- Get him in the car.
- Come on.

668
01:00:09,273 --> 01:00:10,966
- One, two, three, go.
- Go, go, go.

669
01:00:12,718 --> 01:00:13,927
- In the car.
- Go, go, go.

670
01:00:14,095 --> 01:00:15,720
I got the door.

671
01:00:15,888 --> 01:00:16,972
Watch, watch, watch your head.

672
01:00:17,139 --> 01:00:18,391
Let's go!

673
01:00:23,605 --> 01:00:25,189
Go!

674
01:00:31,906 --> 01:00:32,948
Faster, Joao!

675
01:00:35,201 --> 01:00:36,618
Come on bru, come on!

676
01:00:39,455 --> 01:00:41,456
Stay with us. Come on.

677
01:03:45,155 --> 01:03:46,322
Yeah...

678
01:03:46,490 --> 01:03:48,199
Kevin? Yeah, I know...

679
01:03:48,366 --> 01:03:51,452
He's what?... Ah, shit.
Okay, I'm on my way.

680
01:03:54,165 --> 01:03:56,166
Ah, he works for us.

681
01:03:59,337 --> 01:04:01,004
Is that it?

682
01:04:01,172 --> 01:04:03,006
We paid your bail.

683
01:04:03,174 --> 01:04:05,342
You okay?

684
01:04:05,510 --> 01:04:07,095
Kev, what the fuck happened, man?

685
01:04:08,806 --> 01:04:13,384
- I ripped my shirt, man. Fuck.
- All right, let's go.

686
01:04:13,852 --> 01:04:16,521
I'll tell you,
but you know how I was supposed

687
01:04:16,688 --> 01:04:19,690
to cover that thing with, um,
with Mandela at the hotel?

688
01:04:19,859 --> 01:04:21,193
You know? I was supposed to be there.

689
01:04:21,361 --> 01:04:23,695
But then... but then something
went wrong with my bakkie

690
01:04:23,863 --> 01:04:25,531
and then there's a fucking tree, man,

691
01:04:25,698 --> 01:04:27,491
and I fucking went right into it.

692
01:04:27,659 --> 01:04:30,410
And then, the fucking cops came
and they found my stash, man.

693
01:04:30,578 --> 01:04:34,165
Ken, I need a favour.

694
01:04:34,333 --> 01:04:35,792
What?

695
01:04:38,212 --> 01:04:40,630
I just need one frame of Mandela.

696
01:04:40,798 --> 01:04:43,049
That's it. You know,
you said you were going to cover it.

697
01:04:43,217 --> 01:04:45,802
You said you were going to cover it
for The Star.

698
01:04:45,970 --> 01:04:48,222
Right? That's all I need.
I need something to bring in.

699
01:04:48,390 --> 01:04:50,724
No. No way. Not again, man.

700
01:04:50,892 --> 01:04:52,518
My frames belong to the paper.

701
01:04:52,686 --> 01:04:54,353
- I wasn't there.
- You weren't there?

702
01:04:54,521 --> 01:04:56,063
-No.

703
01:04:56,231 --> 01:04:58,732
I just need one frame.
Something to bring in.

704
01:05:00,068 --> 01:05:01,736
Fuck you, Kev. No.

705
01:05:02,572 --> 01:05:03,989
Just give him a frame.

706
01:05:06,409 --> 01:05:10,579
Okay. But you must get your shit
together, you understand me?

707
01:05:11,414 --> 01:05:13,081
I promise.

708
01:05:19,923 --> 01:05:22,425
Calm down. Kevin... Kevin!

709
01:05:22,593 --> 01:05:24,635
Please.

710
01:05:24,803 --> 01:05:26,762
It wasn't my decision.

711
01:05:28,099 --> 01:05:29,766
Kevin.

712
01:05:29,934 --> 01:05:32,686
You bitch.

713
01:05:32,854 --> 01:05:36,273
She fired me and Ken watched it.

714
01:05:36,441 --> 01:05:38,595
You fucker. You watched it.

715
01:05:39,614 --> 01:05:41,279
Kevin...

716
01:05:45,951 --> 01:05:47,994
It was the drugs.

717
01:05:48,162 --> 01:05:50,955
Listen, my chinas.

718
01:05:53,125 --> 01:05:55,961
All-all I need is enough money
to cover airfare and hotel.

719
01:05:57,130 --> 01:05:58,464
I have to go to the Sudan with Joao.

720
01:06:09,310 --> 01:06:10,435
You're not gonna smoke that.

721
01:06:10,603 --> 01:06:12,437
It's full of cat hair.

722
01:06:12,605 --> 01:06:15,023
I'm going to get myself sorted.

723
01:06:15,191 --> 01:06:17,734
I need to get my shit together. Get...

724
01:06:17,902 --> 01:06:20,111
I'm gonna stop. I'm gonna get sorted.

725
01:06:20,279 --> 01:06:22,114
Did I tell you Allie threw me out?

726
01:06:22,282 --> 01:06:24,367
Mm-hmm. Aye, you told us.

727
01:06:24,534 --> 01:06:27,161
And then Joao's only leaving tomorrow,
so there's still time.

728
01:06:29,665 --> 01:06:30,665
Joao?

729
01:06:32,334 --> 01:06:33,751
Sure. Why not?

730
01:06:36,923 --> 01:06:39,007
That's all I've got.

731
01:06:40,760 --> 01:06:44,012
Here, Kev. I'll give you more
at the airport.

732
01:06:48,936 --> 01:06:50,937
Thanks.

733
01:06:57,695 --> 01:06:58,695
So they've gone?

734
01:06:58,862 --> 01:07:00,655
This morning, yeah.

735
01:07:00,823 --> 01:07:02,700
And you gave him money?

736
01:07:02,867 --> 01:07:05,995
He was really chuffed about it
when we put him on the plane, yeah.

737
01:07:07,497 --> 01:07:10,374
Maybe it'll do him some good.

738
01:07:11,710 --> 01:07:12,751
Hello...

739
01:07:12,919 --> 01:07:15,046
Yeah, it's Greg...

740
01:07:15,214 --> 01:07:17,549
Yeah...

741
01:07:17,717 --> 01:07:20,218
That's what you saw?...

742
01:07:20,386 --> 01:07:22,470
Okay...

743
01:07:22,638 --> 01:07:23,888
Yeah, great...

744
01:07:24,056 --> 01:07:25,724
Thanks...

745
01:07:25,891 --> 01:07:27,559
Thanks.

746
01:07:33,942 --> 01:07:37,445
- What are you doing?
- An Inkatha attack in Boipatong.

747
01:07:37,612 --> 01:07:39,572
There's armed men all over the township.

748
01:07:39,740 --> 01:07:42,117
My stringer says some are white
and wearing balaclavas.

749
01:07:42,285 --> 01:07:46,538
Maybe this time I can actually catch
the police doing something.

750
01:07:48,958 --> 01:07:50,667
No, you can't go in there on your own.

751
01:07:50,835 --> 01:07:53,128
You know Ken's in Bop,
covering a boxing match.

752
01:07:53,296 --> 01:07:55,214
It's important I'm there and I'm going.

753
01:07:56,216 --> 01:07:57,467
Jesus, Greg.

754
01:07:57,634 --> 01:07:59,469
This is bullshit.

755
01:07:59,636 --> 01:08:01,429
No one goes into Boipatong at night.

756
01:08:04,433 --> 01:08:06,893
You're behaving just like Kevin.

757
01:08:07,061 --> 01:08:09,396
A fucking junkie.

758
01:08:09,564 --> 01:08:10,773
Fuck.

759
01:08:12,776 --> 01:08:15,402
- I'm coming with you.
- Robin...

760
01:08:15,570 --> 01:08:17,404
If it's safe enough for you...

761
01:08:32,296 --> 01:08:34,798
- Would you light that, Robs?
- Yeah, sure.

762
01:08:51,084 --> 01:08:54,659
<b>Tugela Street, Boipatong Township</b>

763
01:09:52,883 --> 01:09:54,425
Can we have a seat?

764
01:10:03,644 --> 01:10:06,062
Hello, sir.

765
01:10:07,815 --> 01:10:09,775
Thank you for letting us into your home.

766
01:10:11,403 --> 01:10:13,237
I'm so sorry for your loss.

767
01:10:14,573 --> 01:10:17,909
But it's important that I find out
what happened here.

768
01:10:22,414 --> 01:10:25,250
They came in buses driven by white men.

769
01:10:26,586 --> 01:10:28,253
And I heard the white men.

770
01:10:29,797 --> 01:10:32,257
They gave them orders:

771
01:10:32,425 --> 01:10:35,260
"Don't talk, just shoot."

772
01:10:38,933 --> 01:10:42,435
I was here at my mother's house

773
01:10:42,603 --> 01:10:44,604
and my son was with me.

774
01:10:46,607 --> 01:10:49,275
And I left him with my mother

775
01:10:49,443 --> 01:10:51,612
to go home for my wife.

776
01:10:55,450 --> 01:10:59,620
I began to run and they ran after me.

777
01:11:00,956 --> 01:11:02,790
And I heard the white men again,

778
01:11:02,958 --> 01:11:04,960
"Catch him! Catch him!"

779
01:11:06,295 --> 01:11:08,588
But I ran faster

780
01:11:08,756 --> 01:11:11,299
and hid behind some bushes.

781
01:11:16,639 --> 01:11:18,891
And all around me...

782
01:11:19,059 --> 01:11:21,477
I heard them kill people.

783
01:11:22,646 --> 01:11:25,982
Pow! Pow! Pow!

784
01:11:27,985 --> 01:11:31,655
As you would kill insects,
stomping on them with your feet.

785
01:11:37,996 --> 01:11:39,413
When they were gone, I...

786
01:11:42,166 --> 01:11:43,667
I ran to my house...

787
01:11:46,338 --> 01:11:48,006
... found my wife.

788
01:11:51,010 --> 01:11:53,595
She was lying out there...

789
01:11:53,762 --> 01:11:55,847
in the dirt

790
01:11:56,015 --> 01:11:59,184
and her intestines were hanging out.

791
01:12:02,522 --> 01:12:06,025
She said to me, "Where is Isaac?

792
01:12:07,193 --> 01:12:08,694
Where's our son?"

793
01:12:11,532 --> 01:12:14,367
I said, "He's safe.
He's with my mother."

794
01:12:17,371 --> 01:12:19,372
She said, "Bring him to me."

795
01:12:24,379 --> 01:12:26,047
So I left her.

796
01:12:28,050 --> 01:12:31,719
I came back here to fetch my son.

797
01:12:34,723 --> 01:12:38,393
When I found my son...

798
01:12:38,561 --> 01:12:40,562
he was dead.

799
01:12:45,735 --> 01:12:47,569
They had no mercy.

800
01:13:09,260 --> 01:13:11,387
May I see your son?

801
01:13:13,223 --> 01:13:15,307
He's in the bedroom.

802
01:13:46,968 --> 01:13:48,468
Robs!

803
01:13:51,139 --> 01:13:52,472
Sorry.

804
01:13:56,936 --> 01:13:59,105
It's too dark.

805
01:14:01,650 --> 01:14:02,859
Come on.

806
01:14:17,208 --> 01:14:18,959
It's in my frame.

807
01:14:26,051 --> 01:14:29,082
You're moving too much. Please.

808
01:14:33,601 --> 01:14:35,560
Can you lean a bit in?

809
01:14:35,728 --> 01:14:38,605
- Just do it. Just do it.
- I'm nearly done.

810
01:14:43,153 --> 01:14:46,238
I can't! I can't! I can't!

811
01:15:39,213 --> 01:15:41,673
Maybe you have to be like that
to do what you do.

812
01:15:43,592 --> 01:15:45,468
Be like what?

813
01:15:47,931 --> 01:15:50,891
I think you have to forget
that those are real people.

814
01:15:51,935 --> 01:15:55,437
There was nothing I could do
for those people, any of them,

815
01:15:55,605 --> 01:15:57,106
except take a photograph.

816
01:15:57,274 --> 01:15:59,860
Nothing.

817
01:16:02,947 --> 01:16:04,698
What do you want from me, Robin?

818
01:16:07,243 --> 01:16:08,535
Nothing.

819
01:16:08,703 --> 01:16:11,872
Okay. Fine. Then why don't you just
leave me the fuck alone?

820
01:16:12,039 --> 01:16:12,957
Right.

821
01:16:48,410 --> 01:16:52,217
<b>UN Feeding Station - Ayod Hamlet, Sudan</b>

822
01:18:37,029 --> 01:18:39,155
Sorry to hear about you and Robin.

823
01:18:39,322 --> 01:18:41,783
Can't say I blame her.

824
01:18:43,619 --> 01:18:45,954
- How was it?
- The whole trip sucked.

825
01:18:46,122 --> 01:18:50,208
Never got near the fucking rebels.
Nothing but flies and skinny people.

826
01:18:52,462 --> 01:18:54,296
Well, we might be back in business here.

827
01:18:54,465 --> 01:18:56,299
After the massacre that night,

828
01:18:56,467 --> 01:18:57,967
I don't know if
this election's gonna happen.

829
01:18:58,135 --> 01:19:01,637
- No shit!
- Well, that's exciting for you guys.

830
01:19:04,725 --> 01:19:07,518
New York Times called.
They're running a Sudan story.

831
01:19:07,686 --> 01:19:09,730
Have you got anything from your trip?

832
01:19:09,898 --> 01:19:13,150
I got kak. Nothing.

833
01:19:14,486 --> 01:19:17,488
There might be something on Kev's roll.

834
01:19:17,655 --> 01:19:19,990
He's been raving about a pic
he took just before we left.

835
01:19:20,158 --> 01:19:22,285
Yeah?

836
01:19:22,453 --> 01:19:24,329
Anything?

837
01:19:25,664 --> 01:19:26,998
It's all shit.

838
01:19:36,343 --> 01:19:37,426
Check this.

839
01:19:47,604 --> 01:19:49,189
Jesus.

840
01:19:51,442 --> 01:19:53,610
Shit.

841
01:19:53,778 --> 01:19:57,697
The spectre of starvation
is haunting Africa once again.

842
01:19:57,865 --> 01:20:01,702
In southern Sudan, people caught
in a relentless cycle of civil war...

843
01:20:01,870 --> 01:20:05,540
The ongoing civil war
in the Sudan was given a spotlight today

844
01:20:05,707 --> 01:20:09,377
when a photograph taken by
South-African photographer Kevin Carter

845
01:20:09,545 --> 01:20:13,131
was published on the front page
of the New York Times.

846
01:20:13,298 --> 01:20:16,343
The picture, which shows a vulture
stalking a little girl,

847
01:20:16,511 --> 01:20:19,221
has caught the attention of the world...

848
01:20:21,891 --> 01:20:23,809
All right.

849
01:20:25,228 --> 01:20:26,478
- Kev.
- Yeah, hold on...

850
01:20:26,646 --> 01:20:29,274
Wake up. Kevin!

851
01:20:29,441 --> 01:20:31,151
Wake up, buddy. Wake up.

852
01:20:31,318 --> 01:20:33,236
Okay, Nancy, here he is.

853
01:20:33,404 --> 01:20:34,529
- Yo.
- Hey.

854
01:20:34,697 --> 01:20:35,822
Kev.

855
01:20:35,990 --> 01:20:38,533
It's Nancy Buirski,
from the New York Times.

856
01:20:38,701 --> 01:20:41,411
Good. Nancy, it's Kevin.

857
01:20:41,579 --> 01:20:43,205
I need an assignment.

858
01:20:43,373 --> 01:20:45,207
I need some money.

859
01:20:45,375 --> 01:20:48,085
Kevin, your photograph
of the child in Sudan

860
01:20:48,253 --> 01:20:49,420
just won the Pulitzer Prize.

861
01:20:49,588 --> 01:20:51,630
They're going...
they're going to throw me out.

862
01:20:51,798 --> 01:20:54,341
Kevin, did you hear what I said?

863
01:20:54,509 --> 01:20:56,595
You just won the Pulitzer Prize.

864
01:20:58,514 --> 01:20:59,514
What?

865
01:20:59,682 --> 01:21:02,434
You just won the Pulitzer Prize.

866
01:21:07,231 --> 01:21:09,358
- Can you hear me?
- Fuck.

867
01:21:09,526 --> 01:21:11,277
- Guys.
- Ke... Kevin?

868
01:21:11,445 --> 01:21:14,113
Nancy. Tell them...

869
01:21:14,281 --> 01:21:17,116
Tell them what you just told me.

870
01:21:17,284 --> 01:21:19,577
I won a Pulitzer.

871
01:21:19,745 --> 01:21:21,454
Kevin?

872
01:21:21,622 --> 01:21:23,665
I knew that when...

873
01:21:23,833 --> 01:21:26,793
when I was taking it,

874
01:21:26,961 --> 01:21:29,046
there was something special, yeah.

875
01:21:29,214 --> 01:21:30,631
Do you have a name for the picture?

876
01:21:30,798 --> 01:21:32,716
I don't name my pictures,

877
01:21:32,884 --> 01:21:35,260
but my friends, they, uh, they named it

878
01:21:35,428 --> 01:21:37,096
The Budgie Picture.

879
01:21:38,974 --> 01:21:40,266
Kevin, many of our readers

880
01:21:40,434 --> 01:21:42,185
have asked about the fate
of the young girl.

881
01:21:42,353 --> 01:21:44,145
The fate?

882
01:21:44,313 --> 01:21:45,355
What happened to the little girl, Kevin?

883
01:21:45,522 --> 01:21:48,483
I... I don't know exactly...

884
01:21:48,651 --> 01:21:49,985
- She...
- Did you chase the vulture away, Kevin?

885
01:21:50,153 --> 01:21:53,506
Yeah, the vulture, yeah... After...

886
01:21:53,626 --> 01:21:58,082
- After I got the, uh, picture...
- But did you physically help her?

887
01:21:58,828 --> 01:22:00,663
- The girl?
- Yeah.

888
01:22:01,915 --> 01:22:05,168
- Not physically.
- Kevin, you didn't pick her up?

889
01:22:05,255 --> 01:22:06,378
That's not his job.

890
01:22:06,545 --> 01:22:08,719
Since when are journalists exempt
from helping people?

891
01:22:08,837 --> 01:22:12,385
I'm not saying I'm exempt
from helping people.

892
01:22:12,443 --> 01:22:15,845
- I think my picture did more than that.
- Why not just make sure she was safe?

893
01:22:16,013 --> 01:22:17,390
Kevin, no one is saying
you shouldn't have taken the photo.

894
01:22:17,557 --> 01:22:18,933
Did you just leave her in the desert
to die, Kevin?

895
01:22:19,101 --> 01:22:20,434
And you see no problem
with the choice you made?

896
01:22:20,602 --> 01:22:22,979
I don't see a problem with the choice.

897
01:22:23,146 --> 01:22:27,024
I went there as a photographer.
I took a great photograph.

898
01:22:27,192 --> 01:22:28,526
Do you really think you did
the right thing?

899
01:22:28,694 --> 01:22:31,363
- You could've done something further.
- What about saving this little girl?

900
01:22:31,531 --> 01:22:34,533
- You don't know what happened?
- But why not just pick up the child?

901
01:22:34,701 --> 01:22:36,118
We need to go.

902
01:22:46,714 --> 01:22:48,548
Why didn't you just tell them the truth?

903
01:22:48,716 --> 01:22:50,758
I told them the truth.

904
01:22:50,926 --> 01:22:52,927
No, you change the story every time.

905
01:22:53,095 --> 01:22:55,305
Leave it alone.

906
01:22:57,976 --> 01:22:59,977
It's an amazing fucking picture.

907
01:23:07,402 --> 01:23:08,485
Okay.

908
01:23:12,283 --> 01:23:13,366
Greg.

909
01:23:15,578 --> 01:23:16,995
They're right, you know.

910
01:23:17,788 --> 01:23:18,705
Who?

911
01:23:18,873 --> 01:23:20,874
All of them.

912
01:23:21,042 --> 01:23:24,086
All of the people that
say that it's our job

913
01:23:24,254 --> 01:23:27,423
to sit there and watch people die.

914
01:23:28,759 --> 01:23:30,468
They're right.

915
01:23:34,097 --> 01:23:35,139
That's not me.

916
01:23:35,307 --> 01:23:36,640
Yes, it is.

917
01:23:36,808 --> 01:23:39,936
It's in your head, Kev, not mine.

918
01:23:40,104 --> 01:23:41,772
I'm not alone.

919
01:23:47,120 --> 01:23:49,863
The South African government
and the African National Congress

920
01:23:50,031 --> 01:23:53,451
have agreed to set a date for South
Africa's first non-racial election.

921
01:23:54,912 --> 01:23:57,413
Today's announcement did little,
however, to stop the violence

922
01:23:57,581 --> 01:24:00,708
which continues to threaten
South Africa's townships.

923
01:24:00,876 --> 01:24:03,169
In an attempt to control the violence,

924
01:24:03,337 --> 01:24:06,465
the two parties also unveiled
a new peacekeeping force.

925
01:24:08,134 --> 01:24:10,552
The newly formed
National Peacekeeping Force,

926
01:24:10,720 --> 01:24:12,971
deployed for the first time
in the townships,

927
01:24:13,139 --> 01:24:16,100
clearly unable to cope
with the high level of violence.

928
01:24:17,686 --> 01:24:19,687
They spent most of the day
hiding under their vehicles.

929
01:24:19,855 --> 01:24:23,775
One man was shot in the leg
by his own comrades.

930
01:24:26,487 --> 01:24:27,654
So how was New York, Jim?

931
01:24:27,822 --> 01:24:29,989
- Yeah, it was good, man. Yeah.
- When did you get in?

932
01:24:30,157 --> 01:24:31,242
Yesterday.

933
01:24:31,410 --> 01:24:34,829
So, what do you guys do
when this is all over?

934
01:24:34,996 --> 01:24:38,866
Well, if this war actually ends,
we're really screwed.

935
01:24:39,835 --> 01:24:41,607
I can't go back
to shooting circumcisions.

936
01:24:41,854 --> 01:24:44,714
What, not enough blood?

937
01:24:44,882 --> 01:24:47,175
No, I'm done with newspapers.

938
01:24:47,343 --> 01:24:48,927
It's magazine features for me now.

939
01:24:49,095 --> 01:24:50,137
I'm getting an appetizer.

940
01:24:50,304 --> 01:24:51,430
You guys want a round?

941
01:24:51,597 --> 01:24:52,347
- Mm.
- Sure.

942
01:24:52,515 --> 01:24:53,974
Thanks Jim.

943
01:24:54,142 --> 01:24:55,684
Times sends him all over the world.

944
01:24:55,852 --> 01:24:58,980
Northern lreland, Bosnia.
All the shitholes.

945
01:24:59,148 --> 01:25:00,565
That's what I want to do.

946
01:25:00,732 --> 01:25:02,191
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

947
01:25:02,359 --> 01:25:04,694
It's a tough gig, eh?

948
01:25:04,862 --> 01:25:06,028
Here you go, Joao.

949
01:25:06,196 --> 01:25:08,030
- Okay.
- Thanks.

950
01:25:08,198 --> 01:25:10,741
So I was thinking of going
to this big ANC rally tomorrow.

951
01:25:10,909 --> 01:25:11,785
How about you guys?

952
01:25:11,953 --> 01:25:14,538
Yeah. Their cause has been cooking
for the last couple of days.

953
01:25:14,706 --> 01:25:17,666
Okay, well let's do it. Can I tag along?

954
01:25:17,834 --> 01:25:20,252
- Of course.
- Jimmy, you don't have to ask.

955
01:25:20,420 --> 01:25:21,712
- Okay.
- Cheers.

956
01:25:21,880 --> 01:25:23,881
- Thanks, guys.
- Yeah. Cheers.

957
01:25:27,320 --> 01:25:32,040
<b>April 18, 1994
One week before election day</b>

958
01:25:32,057 --> 01:25:33,683
So Kevin.

959
01:25:33,851 --> 01:25:36,811
What do you think
makes a photograph great?

960
01:25:36,979 --> 01:25:39,440
Um...

961
01:25:39,608 --> 01:25:41,108
Kevin?

962
01:25:41,276 --> 01:25:44,403
I uh...

963
01:25:44,571 --> 01:25:46,906
I don't know, really.

964
01:25:47,073 --> 01:25:49,617
You take the picture
and you see what you have later.

965
01:25:49,784 --> 01:25:54,414
But, uh... But maybe
what makes a great picture

966
01:25:54,582 --> 01:25:57,417
is one that asks a question, you know?

967
01:25:57,585 --> 01:26:00,545
It's not just a spectacle,
it's more than that.

968
01:26:00,713 --> 01:26:02,339
And I think...

969
01:26:02,507 --> 01:26:06,177
I think mine was like that
and Greg's too.

970
01:26:07,262 --> 01:26:10,014
You go out and you see bad things,

971
01:26:10,182 --> 01:26:12,308
evil things

972
01:26:12,476 --> 01:26:15,061
and you want to do something about it,
so what you do

973
01:26:15,229 --> 01:26:17,271
is you take the picture that shows it.

974
01:26:17,731 --> 01:26:20,609
- Jeez. Jeez, man.
- Fuck.

975
01:26:21,945 --> 01:26:24,655
But not everybody is gonna like
what they see.

976
01:26:24,822 --> 01:26:27,741
You have to understand that
they might want to shoot the messenger.

977
01:26:29,619 --> 01:26:32,121
Now I'm sure you're aware
of all the controversy that surrounds

978
01:26:32,289 --> 01:26:34,791
the photograph of the vulture
and the child

979
01:26:34,959 --> 01:26:38,880
and a lot of people are asking
a lot of questions.

980
01:26:39,048 --> 01:26:40,647
This may be difficult for you to answer,

981
01:26:40,692 --> 01:26:43,299
but do you know
what happened to that child?

982
01:26:46,555 --> 01:26:47,638
Kevin?

983
01:26:49,057 --> 01:26:52,017
- What are they running from?
- I don't know.

984
01:26:58,316 --> 01:27:00,193
- Fuck! Fuck!
- Fuck!

985
01:27:00,361 --> 01:27:02,862
Fuck!

986
01:27:03,030 --> 01:27:04,155
- Shit!
- Fuck!

987
01:27:08,327 --> 01:27:10,328
Greg, pass me the phone.

988
01:27:17,337 --> 01:27:19,255
Robin, it's Ken...

989
01:27:20,382 --> 01:27:21,424
Yeah, we're in Thokoza.

990
01:27:22,259 --> 01:27:25,344
There's lots of guns here.
It's gonna get fucking hectic down here.

991
01:27:25,512 --> 01:27:27,014
A bunch of peacekeepers that don't know
what the fuck they're doing.

992
01:27:27,181 --> 01:27:29,016
Listen, we're going in.

993
01:27:29,183 --> 01:27:30,934
Make sure they use the fucking pictures.

994
01:27:32,687 --> 01:27:34,271
Let's go. Let's go.

995
01:27:34,439 --> 01:27:36,857
- What the fuck's going on?
- Who cares, it's bang bang.

996
01:27:41,862 --> 01:27:45,349
<b>Khumalo Street, Thokoza Township</b>

997
01:28:16,025 --> 01:28:19,099
<b>Mshaya ' zafe Workers Hostel</b>

998
01:28:22,407 --> 01:28:25,409
Fuck, this oke's been shot
across the road there.

999
01:28:45,264 --> 01:28:46,933
Shit! Look out, Ken! Ken! Ken! Ken!

1000
01:28:56,318 --> 01:28:57,944
Get the fucking shot.

1001
01:28:58,112 --> 01:28:59,737
Come on. Take it like a man.
You're a puss.

1002
01:28:59,906 --> 01:29:01,782
Fucking pussy.

1003
01:29:01,950 --> 01:29:04,159
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you, man.

1004
01:29:04,327 --> 01:29:06,412
- You get the shot.
- Puss.

1005
01:29:06,579 --> 01:29:07,871
Move, move. I'll get it.

1006
01:29:14,338 --> 01:29:16,756
Sheesh! Woo!

1007
01:29:17,296 --> 01:29:18,596
Yeah. Told you.

1008
01:29:41,117 --> 01:29:42,826
- What's going on?
- Welcome boys.

1009
01:30:00,596 --> 01:30:01,596
Who's thirsty?

1010
01:30:01,764 --> 01:30:02,680
- What?
- What?

1011
01:30:02,848 --> 01:30:04,599
- Who wants a Coke?
- What?

1012
01:30:04,767 --> 01:30:05,767
No, man.

1013
01:30:05,934 --> 01:30:07,394
No, I'm going to go
to that spot over there.

1014
01:30:07,562 --> 01:30:09,772
Okay, well if you're gonna go, go.

1015
01:30:09,939 --> 01:30:11,064
- Ready?
- Don't get shot, dude.

1016
01:30:11,232 --> 01:30:12,191
Oh!

1017
01:30:12,358 --> 01:30:14,485
Idiot.

1018
01:30:15,612 --> 01:30:17,863
- Woo!
- Yeah!

1019
01:30:19,449 --> 01:30:20,867
Hello!

1020
01:30:22,870 --> 01:30:25,955
Hello, anybody here?! Hello?

1021
01:30:26,123 --> 01:30:27,999
Ah... Two Cokes, my bru.

1022
01:30:28,167 --> 01:30:29,542
Two...

1023
01:30:29,710 --> 01:30:31,002
Two rand.

1024
01:30:36,968 --> 01:30:38,302
Shit.

1025
01:30:39,679 --> 01:30:40,930
Greg!

1026
01:30:41,097 --> 01:30:42,473
Run!

1027
01:30:49,857 --> 01:30:51,691
- Ah! Fuck!
- Run!

1028
01:30:54,904 --> 01:30:56,112
Thanks.

1029
01:31:04,706 --> 01:31:06,290
We're gonna take out
this nest of snipers, okay?

1030
01:31:06,458 --> 01:31:08,501
We're going to
move down along this wall.

1031
01:31:09,795 --> 01:31:11,879
As soon as you get around the corner,
you start firing.

1032
01:31:12,047 --> 01:31:13,130
All right?

1033
01:31:13,298 --> 01:31:15,759
I say when they go,
we go with the same wave.

1034
01:31:15,927 --> 01:31:16,927
- You got it, Joao?
- Yeah, yeah.

1035
01:31:17,095 --> 01:31:19,304
- Are we gonna fucking do this thing?
- Yes.

1036
01:31:19,472 --> 01:31:21,640
Okay. You guys can come in after us.

1037
01:31:21,808 --> 01:31:24,184
Okay, we're gonna get covering fire
from the Mamba. Bring in the Mamba!

1038
01:31:24,352 --> 01:31:26,895
- It's starting to heat up.
- Alright, get ready! Move down!

1039
01:31:28,607 --> 01:31:30,608
Go! Go! Go! Go!

1040
01:31:30,776 --> 01:31:32,694
Get in there, you fucking bastard!

1041
01:31:33,821 --> 01:31:35,488
Go, you piece of shit! Get in there!

1042
01:31:35,656 --> 01:31:37,448
Go! Go! Go!

1043
01:31:37,616 --> 01:31:40,493
Go! Bloody legged! Get off your ass!

1044
01:31:43,164 --> 01:31:44,748
Ugh!

1045
01:31:50,005 --> 01:31:51,130
I'm hit! I'm hit!

1046
01:31:51,298 --> 01:31:53,549
Hold your fire.

1047
01:31:53,717 --> 01:31:55,719
- Hold your fire!
- Cease fire!

1048
01:31:57,889 --> 01:32:00,140
Get your hands off those weapons!

1049
01:32:00,308 --> 01:32:01,516
Fuck!

1050
01:32:01,684 --> 01:32:03,101
Shit!

1051
01:32:03,269 --> 01:32:04,686
We've got another man down.

1052
01:32:04,854 --> 01:32:06,479
- Jesus! Ken's hit! Ken's been hit!
- Hold your fucking fire!

1053
01:32:06,647 --> 01:32:09,066
- Keep still. Keep still.
- Ken's been hit.

1054
01:32:12,988 --> 01:32:14,864
I'm okay. Help Ken.

1055
01:33:15,722 --> 01:33:18,766
- Where? Where?
- In there.

1056
01:33:18,934 --> 01:33:19,934
Ken!

1057
01:33:20,102 --> 01:33:21,811
Ken!

1058
01:33:53,137 --> 01:33:55,596
- Joao....
- Sam...

1059
01:33:55,764 --> 01:33:56,765
Is he?

1060
01:33:56,933 --> 01:33:58,726
Sam...

1061
01:33:58,893 --> 01:34:00,394
Sam...

1062
01:34:11,782 --> 01:34:12,866
Ken's dead.

1063
01:34:22,418 --> 01:34:24,628
Hi, Robs.

1064
01:34:24,796 --> 01:34:27,048
Hello.

1065
01:34:28,467 --> 01:34:29,717
Where's Ken?

1066
01:34:33,805 --> 01:34:34,889
Is he all right?

1067
01:34:36,476 --> 01:34:37,642
No.

1068
01:34:57,498 --> 01:34:59,248
I'll be back.

1069
01:35:21,857 --> 01:35:23,191
Hey.

1070
01:35:23,359 --> 01:35:25,193
Hi.

1071
01:35:29,198 --> 01:35:31,200
I just want them to all leave.

1072
01:35:33,870 --> 01:35:35,204
Yeah, I know.

1073
01:35:52,682 --> 01:35:54,933
The explosion of violence
in this township

1074
01:35:55,101 --> 01:35:57,061
is an ominous sign for South Africa

1075
01:35:57,229 --> 01:35:59,063
at the beginning of a week

1076
01:35:59,231 --> 01:36:01,482
of planned protests
and demonstrations by Inkatha.

1077
01:36:01,650 --> 01:36:03,484
I would like to express

1078
01:36:03,652 --> 01:36:07,405
my deepest sympathy

1079
01:36:07,573 --> 01:36:11,743
to the family of Ken Oosterbroek.

1080
01:36:11,911 --> 01:36:14,746
- To Ken Oosterbroek!
- Yeah!

1081
01:36:30,598 --> 01:36:31,764
- Sorry.
- You fucker.

1082
01:36:31,932 --> 01:36:33,766
- Sorry, man.
- You spilled my fucking drink.

1083
01:36:34,602 --> 01:36:35,935
I said I was sorry, man.

1084
01:36:36,103 --> 01:36:37,187
Fucking asshole.

1085
01:36:37,354 --> 01:36:39,440
- Watch your mouth, motherfucker.
- Think you can take me on?

1086
01:36:51,621 --> 01:36:55,957
I didn't tell you, but I got an offer
from AP a few days ago.

1087
01:36:58,294 --> 01:37:00,170
They want to send me to Afghanistan.

1088
01:37:00,338 --> 01:37:02,297
I'll be leaving next month.

1089
01:37:05,802 --> 01:37:08,304
It's what I've always wanted.

1090
01:37:11,308 --> 01:37:12,475
Viv?

1091
01:37:12,643 --> 01:37:14,310
Mm-hmm?

1092
01:37:15,646 --> 01:37:17,146
Will you marry me?

1093
01:37:19,651 --> 01:37:21,318
Yup.

1094
01:37:29,077 --> 01:37:31,996
Still non-stop jol, is it?

1095
01:37:33,999 --> 01:37:35,416
How you doing?

1096
01:37:36,752 --> 01:37:40,755
Better. Really better, yeah.

1097
01:37:46,012 --> 01:37:48,430
I've been thinking about us.

1098
01:37:50,433 --> 01:37:53,394
I think I lost the plot for a while.

1099
01:37:53,561 --> 01:37:55,354
I'm sorry.

1100
01:37:58,359 --> 01:38:02,028
I think it's an occupational hazard.

1101
01:38:09,840 --> 01:38:13,708
And minutes into
Wednesday April the 27 1994,

1102
01:38:13,875 --> 01:38:16,043
the flag of freedom and equality
for all races

1103
01:38:16,211 --> 01:38:18,337
flew over South Africa.

1104
01:38:22,050 --> 01:38:25,887
The enthusiasm for voting
among blacks of all ages and conditions

1105
01:38:26,055 --> 01:38:28,557
caught the mainly white organizers
unprepared.

1106
01:38:28,725 --> 01:38:31,393
Millions more ballot papers
had to be produced

1107
01:38:31,561 --> 01:38:34,396
and in six regions,
a fourth day allowed for voting.

1108
01:38:35,231 --> 01:38:37,232
Inkatha's late entry into the election

1109
01:38:37,400 --> 01:38:40,069
meant its candidates had to be added
to ballot papers.

1110
01:38:41,405 --> 01:38:42,739
Despite the problems,

1111
01:38:42,906 --> 01:38:46,034
the historic poll is expected
to be declared free and fair.

1112
01:39:24,117 --> 01:39:27,953
My name is Kevin Carter.

1113
01:39:28,121 --> 01:39:31,290
Without phone, money for rent,

1114
01:39:31,458 --> 01:39:34,252
Money for debts, money...

1115
01:39:35,397 --> 01:39:39,299
I'm haunted by the vivid memories
of killings and corpses

1116
01:39:39,467 --> 01:39:41,426
and anger and pain...

1117
01:39:41,594 --> 01:39:44,805
Of killer executioners...

1118
01:39:46,141 --> 01:39:50,144
Of trigger-happy madmen, often police.

1119
01:39:53,482 --> 01:39:58,569
I have gone to join Ken,
if I'm that lucky.

1120
01:40:51,591 --> 01:40:55,834
<b>In 2000, Joao Silva was made a contract

1121
