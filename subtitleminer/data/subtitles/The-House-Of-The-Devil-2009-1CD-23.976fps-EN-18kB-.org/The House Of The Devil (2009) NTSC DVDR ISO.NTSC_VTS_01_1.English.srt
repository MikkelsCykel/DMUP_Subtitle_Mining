1
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,495
I can tell you like it.

2
00:02:01,535 --> 00:02:03,969
Oh.
I love it.

3
00:02:04,004 --> 00:02:04,993
It's perfect.

4
00:02:05,038 --> 00:02:06,027
Well, great.

5
00:02:06,072 --> 00:02:07,733
It really is such a neat place.

6
00:02:07,774 --> 00:02:11,301
You know, I showed it
to another girl this morning.

7
00:02:11,344 --> 00:02:13,574
But to be honest,
I didn't like her very much.

8
00:02:13,613 --> 00:02:15,012
She looks like trouble,

9
00:02:15,048 --> 00:02:19,109
and I'm way too old to be
dealing with all that nonsense.

10
00:02:19,152 --> 00:02:22,553
I go a lot on my gut feelings,
and I have a good one about you.

11
00:02:22,589 --> 00:02:24,580
You remind me of my daughter.

12
00:02:24,624 --> 00:02:26,489
Oh, thank you.

13
00:02:26,526 --> 00:02:29,518
It's just what
I've been looking for.

14
00:02:29,563 --> 00:02:30,655
Well, great.

15
00:02:30,697 --> 00:02:36,533
Welcome to your new home.

16
00:02:48,715 --> 00:02:51,115
I'll get things moving
on your application,

17
00:02:51,151 --> 00:02:55,383
and we'll have you set up here
in no time.

18
00:02:55,422 --> 00:02:59,882
Um, about the deposit, um...

19
00:02:59,926 --> 00:03:01,484
Okay, I'll tell you what.

20
00:03:01,528 --> 00:03:04,053
If it'll help you out,
and I imagine it would,

21
00:03:04,097 --> 00:03:06,224
I'll agree to waive
all of the deposit stuff.

22
00:03:06,266 --> 00:03:08,131
You just give me
the first month's down.

23
00:03:08,168 --> 00:03:09,396
We'll call it a day, alright?

24
00:03:09,436 --> 00:03:10,425
Really?

25
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:12,028
That would be incredible.

26
00:03:12,072 --> 00:03:14,438
Well, I remember when
my daughter was looking

27
00:03:14,474 --> 00:03:15,941
for her first apartment.

28
00:03:15,976 --> 00:03:17,967
It's hard coming up
with all that money, isn't it?

29
00:03:18,011 --> 00:03:19,171
You just promise me

30
00:03:19,212 --> 00:03:21,680
that you are gonna take
good care of this place.

31
00:03:21,715 --> 00:03:22,841
I promise.

32
00:03:22,883 --> 00:03:24,680
Besides,
you'll be a good tenant.

33
00:03:24,718 --> 00:03:26,208
I always trust my gut.

34
00:03:26,253 --> 00:03:27,550
Well, you won't regret it.

35
00:03:27,587 --> 00:03:28,576
I swear.

36
00:03:28,622 --> 00:03:31,216
Oh, you know,
I have some things

37
00:03:31,258 --> 00:03:34,193
I have to still take care of
with the gal that lives here.

38
00:03:34,227 --> 00:03:35,819
You just get me the check
by Monday.

39
00:03:35,862 --> 00:03:37,295
I'll have you in by the end
of the week,

40
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:38,854
if that's okay with you.

41
00:03:38,899 --> 00:03:39,923
I can do whatever.

42
00:03:39,966 --> 00:03:40,990
Good.

43
00:03:41,034 --> 00:03:42,228
Thank you so much.

44
00:03:42,269 --> 00:03:43,827
You bet, sweetie.
Bye-bye.

45
00:07:06,439 --> 00:07:08,907
Heather, come on.

46
00:07:08,942 --> 00:07:12,070
It's morning.

47
00:08:27,754 --> 00:08:30,018
<i>Please leave a message</i>
<i>after the beep. </i>

48
00:08:31,558 --> 00:08:33,116
Hi.

49
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:34,353
This is Samantha Hughes.

50
00:08:34,394 --> 00:08:37,420
I'm calling in regards
to the babysitter flyer

51
00:08:37,463 --> 00:08:40,432
posted outside my dorm.

52
00:08:40,466 --> 00:08:42,127
I hope this is the right number.

53
00:08:42,168 --> 00:08:46,798
If it is, you can reach me
at 815-1920.

54
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,398
I'm very interested.

55
00:08:48,441 --> 00:08:50,671
Thank you.

56
00:09:26,512 --> 00:09:27,672
Hello?

57
00:09:27,714 --> 00:09:29,113
<i>Samantha. </i>

58
00:09:29,148 --> 00:09:30,740
Yes?

59
00:09:30,783 --> 00:09:35,243
<i>You just left me a message</i>
<i>about the babysitting position. </i>

60
00:09:35,288 --> 00:09:38,155
Oh, yeah, I did.

61
00:09:38,191 --> 00:09:40,182
How did you get this number?

62
00:09:40,226 --> 00:09:43,923
<i>Please excuse the urgency,</i>
<i>but if you're still interested,</i>

63
00:09:43,963 --> 00:09:45,931
<i>I would like to meet you. </i>

64
00:09:45,965 --> 00:09:46,954
Sure.

65
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,025
That would be fine.

66
00:09:49,068 --> 00:09:50,797
<i>Well, I'm afraid</i>
<i>I'm not too familiar</i>

67
00:09:50,837 --> 00:09:52,031
<i>with the layout over there. </i>

68
00:09:52,071 --> 00:09:53,095
<i>Perhaps you could meet me</i>

69
00:09:53,139 --> 00:09:55,699
<i>in front</i>
<i>of the Student Affairs office?</i>

70
00:09:55,742 --> 00:09:58,074
<i>That's where I dropped off</i>
<i>my advertisements. </i>

71
00:09:58,111 --> 00:10:00,671
Okay, I know where that is.

72
00:10:00,713 --> 00:10:02,010
<i>Wonderful. </i>

73
00:10:02,048 --> 00:10:03,777
<i>I'll see you there. </i>

74
00:10:03,816 --> 00:10:08,219
Right now?

75
00:10:08,254 --> 00:10:10,222
Hello?

76
00:11:14,153 --> 00:11:15,916
<i>Psst.

77
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:46,675
<i>Alright, everyone. </i>

78
00:11:48,821 --> 00:11:50,721
<i>Have a great holiday. </i>
<i>I'll see you guys next year. </i>

79
00:11:50,757 --> 00:11:53,624
<i>Whoo-hoo. </i>
<i>Whoo. </i>

80
00:13:01,127 --> 00:13:02,822
You have all the paperwork
for that?

81
00:13:02,862 --> 00:13:07,196
Yeah, it's really kind of far,
don't you think?

82
00:13:07,233 --> 00:13:10,225
When are you going to get back?

83
00:13:40,466 --> 00:13:42,491
So tell me all about it.

84
00:13:42,535 --> 00:13:46,266
I want details.

85
00:13:46,305 --> 00:13:48,671
Well, it's not too big.

86
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:50,073
When you walk in,

87
00:13:50,109 --> 00:13:53,203
there's, like, a little
living room area on the left

88
00:13:53,246 --> 00:13:54,543
and then a hallway
down the right.

89
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:55,979
Oh, it is carpet or hardwood?

90
00:13:56,015 --> 00:13:57,107
Hardwood.

91
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:58,139
Good.

92
00:13:58,184 --> 00:13:59,742
Oarpet's filth,

93
00:13:59,785 --> 00:14:01,980
especially for a germaphobe
like you.

94
00:14:02,021 --> 00:14:04,387
I'm not a germaphobe.

95
00:14:05,558 --> 00:14:06,718
What?

96
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:09,227
I don't like gross things.

97
00:14:09,262 --> 00:14:11,287
Anyway,
the kitchen's kind of blah,

98
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:12,524
and so is the bathroom.

99
00:14:12,565 --> 00:14:15,125
But I'll paint them cool colors
or something.

100
00:14:15,168 --> 00:14:16,157
Yeah.

101
00:14:16,202 --> 00:14:18,727
Oh.

102
00:14:18,771 --> 00:14:20,033
I wish you had pictures.

103
00:14:20,072 --> 00:14:21,369
Yeah, me, too.

104
00:14:21,407 --> 00:14:23,204
I'm sort of sucking
at explaining it right now.

105
00:14:23,242 --> 00:14:25,540
But you'll see it soon.

106
00:14:25,578 --> 00:14:28,376
Yeah, well, it sounds great.

107
00:14:29,949 --> 00:14:34,352
Mm.

108
00:14:34,387 --> 00:14:37,015
This pizza is nasty today.

109
00:14:37,056 --> 00:14:38,751
Gross.

110
00:14:38,791 --> 00:14:41,589
Ugh.

111
00:14:41,627 --> 00:14:43,788
Megan, how am I gonna afford
all this stuff?

112
00:14:43,829 --> 00:14:46,059
I'm...
you're gonna be fine.

113
00:14:46,098 --> 00:14:47,963
It's gonna work out.

114
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,331
That's easy for you to say.

115
00:14:49,368 --> 00:14:51,393
You're not the one
with $84 in her bank account

116
00:14:51,437 --> 00:14:52,927
and a check to write on Monday.

117
00:14:52,972 --> 00:14:55,440
Yeah, but just relax.

118
00:14:55,474 --> 00:14:57,032
It's Wednesday.

119
00:14:57,076 --> 00:14:59,567
You know, if it's a big problem,
I can always call my dad.

120
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:04,247
No, don't do that.

121
00:15:04,283 --> 00:15:07,116
No, look, he really
doesn't care at all.

122
00:15:07,153 --> 00:15:09,713
Look, I'm not saying
it's gonna get to that point,

123
00:15:09,755 --> 00:15:12,246
but if it does,
you're never gonna be homeless.

124
00:15:12,291 --> 00:15:13,952
Yeah?

125
00:15:17,029 --> 00:15:18,291
It's so weird and annoying

126
00:15:18,331 --> 00:15:20,060
the way that guy
stood you up today.

127
00:15:20,099 --> 00:15:23,068
I know.

128
00:15:23,102 --> 00:15:24,729
You're gonna find something.

129
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:26,101
Okay?

130
00:15:26,138 --> 00:15:31,576
Did you go to the job board
at the intern office?

131
00:15:31,611 --> 00:15:32,703
That ham-faced girl,

132
00:15:32,745 --> 00:15:34,144
you know, in my class?

133
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:37,843
Yeah, she said there's
good stuff there sometimes.

134
00:15:37,883 --> 00:15:39,145
No, I haven't been yet.

135
00:15:39,185 --> 00:15:40,311
Although it would be cool

136
00:15:40,353 --> 00:15:41,980
to get something easy
and under the table.

137
00:15:42,021 --> 00:15:44,285
That's what was so good about
the babysitter thing.

138
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:47,289
Yeah, but it
could have been awful.

139
00:15:47,326 --> 00:15:48,315
You know?

140
00:15:48,361 --> 00:15:49,623
The kid could be from hell.

141
00:15:49,662 --> 00:15:52,358
You don't even like kids anyway.

142
00:15:52,398 --> 00:15:54,195
Yeah, I guess.

143
00:15:57,536 --> 00:15:59,094
You know what you should do?

144
00:15:59,138 --> 00:16:01,038
You should go around campus

145
00:16:01,073 --> 00:16:04,907
and rip down all of the other
posters he put up,

146
00:16:04,944 --> 00:16:06,309
and then nobody else calls him.

147
00:16:06,345 --> 00:16:07,369
How do you like them apples?

148
00:16:07,413 --> 00:16:08,812
That's good payback, right?

149
00:16:08,848 --> 00:16:09,837
Nah.

150
00:16:09,882 --> 00:16:10,871
What?

151
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:12,281
It's genius,

152
00:16:12,318 --> 00:16:15,287
because then nobody else
will show up.

153
00:16:15,321 --> 00:16:17,516
No, I just want to forget it.

154
00:16:17,556 --> 00:16:18,545
No more drama.

155
00:16:20,726 --> 00:16:22,353
Alright then.

156
00:16:23,763 --> 00:16:24,752
You want to go?

157
00:16:24,797 --> 00:16:26,458
Yeah.

158
00:18:51,177 --> 00:18:53,668
Get a grip!

159
00:19:13,432 --> 00:19:15,332
What the hell time is it?

160
00:19:16,702 --> 00:19:18,465
Night.

161
00:19:19,805 --> 00:19:21,932
Oh, shit.

162
00:19:24,877 --> 00:19:26,401
Where's your friend?

163
00:19:28,347 --> 00:19:29,974
Who cares?

164
00:19:33,118 --> 00:19:35,746
Ugh.

165
00:19:40,392 --> 00:19:41,882
Someone called for you.

166
00:19:41,927 --> 00:19:43,519
Who?

167
00:19:43,562 --> 00:19:45,189
I don't know.

168
00:19:45,231 --> 00:19:48,723
Some dude, some guy.

169
00:19:48,767 --> 00:19:52,168
I left his number on your desk.

170
00:19:58,177 --> 00:20:01,112
Where?
Where did you put it?

171
00:20:01,146 --> 00:20:02,773
Ohill out.
It's there.

172
00:20:02,815 --> 00:20:04,612
I just...

173
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:05,639
I don't know.

174
00:20:05,684 --> 00:20:09,916
By your pens, maybe.

175
00:20:09,955 --> 00:20:12,924
When was this?

176
00:20:20,866 --> 00:20:23,198
<i>Please leave a message</i>
<i>after the beep. </i>

177
00:20:24,937 --> 00:20:27,303
Hello, this is
Samantha Hughes again.

178
00:20:27,339 --> 00:20:30,740
I got a message
that you called...

179
00:20:30,776 --> 00:20:31,902
<i>Samantha?</i>

180
00:20:31,944 --> 00:20:34,174
Yes?

181
00:20:34,213 --> 00:20:36,113
<i>Oh, thank goodness you called. </i>

182
00:20:36,148 --> 00:20:37,706
<i>Quite frankly,</i>
<i>I didn't think you would. </i>

183
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:38,944
<i>I'm so sorry about this morning. </i>

184
00:20:38,984 --> 00:20:41,111
<i>Things were very hectic for me,</i>

185
00:20:41,153 --> 00:20:43,747
<i>and I got caught up in lots</i>
<i>of last minute details. </i>

186
00:20:43,789 --> 00:20:45,723
<i>It was a bit of a catastrophe. </i>

187
00:20:45,758 --> 00:20:48,352
It's alright.
Don't worry about it.

188
00:20:48,394 --> 00:20:50,123
<i>I spoke with another girl</i>
<i>this morning</i>

189
00:20:50,162 --> 00:20:51,527
<i>who I thought was going</i>
<i>to work out,</i>

190
00:20:51,564 --> 00:20:54,795
<i>but she turned out to be</i>
<i>totally unreliable. </i>

191
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:56,425
<i>And while I can</i>
<i>certainly understand</i>

192
00:20:56,468 --> 00:20:59,266
<i>you being upset with me,</i>
<i>I must be honest. </i>

193
00:20:59,305 --> 00:21:01,239
<i>I'm in dire need of someone. </i>

194
00:21:01,273 --> 00:21:03,104
You mean tonight?

195
00:21:03,142 --> 00:21:04,734
<i>Yes. </i>

196
00:21:04,777 --> 00:21:06,005
<i>It's very important. </i>

197
00:21:06,045 --> 00:21:07,603
Um...

198
00:21:07,646 --> 00:21:10,171
<i>I will pay you double</i>
<i>what I would have normally. </i>

199
00:21:10,215 --> 00:21:12,206
<i>That's $100.</i>

200
00:21:12,251 --> 00:21:13,616
<i>It's very simple. </i>

201
00:21:13,652 --> 00:21:16,018
<i>It wouldn't take even</i>
<i>much of your time. </i>

202
00:21:16,055 --> 00:21:20,287
<i>We would be home soon</i>
<i>after midnight. </i>

203
00:21:20,326 --> 00:21:21,315
<i>Are you there?</i>

204
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:26,059
Yes, um...

205
00:21:26,098 --> 00:21:27,190
Okay.

206
00:21:27,232 --> 00:21:28,221
I think I can do it.

207
00:21:28,267 --> 00:21:30,428
<i>Oh, thank goodness. </i>

208
00:21:30,469 --> 00:21:31,902
<i>You're saving me. </i>

209
00:21:31,937 --> 00:21:34,337
<i>And I promise to make this</i>
<i>as painless for you as possible. </i>

210
00:21:34,373 --> 00:21:35,362
That's okay.

211
00:21:35,407 --> 00:21:36,772
I can always use the money.

212
00:21:36,809 --> 00:21:38,140
<i>Of course. </i>

213
00:21:38,177 --> 00:21:42,170
<i>Let me give you the address. </i>

214
00:21:55,661 --> 00:21:59,222
# <i>We had broken up for good</i>
<i>just an hour before,</i> #

215
00:21:59,264 --> 00:22:02,665
# <i>uh-uh-uh</i>
<i>uh-uh-uh-uh-uh. </i> #

216
00:22:06,205 --> 00:22:10,869
# <i>Uh-uh-uh</i>
<i>uh-uh-uh-uh-uh. </i> #

217
00:22:12,144 --> 00:22:14,169
- Hey.
- Hey.

218
00:22:14,213 --> 00:22:15,373
Thanks for the ride.

219
00:22:15,414 --> 00:22:17,712
I'm just your monkey
with a cigarette.

220
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:18,739
Okay.

221
00:22:24,423 --> 00:22:30,623
# <i>They don't write 'em</i>
<i>like that anymore. </i> #

222
00:22:32,031 --> 00:22:34,192
<i>(radio announcer) The whole kit</i>
<i>and caboodle kicks off tonight</i>

223
00:22:34,233 --> 00:22:35,757
<i>just after 10:30.</i>

224
00:22:35,801 --> 00:22:37,359
<i>I know it's late</i>
<i>for some of you folks,</i>

225
00:22:37,403 --> 00:22:39,769
<i>but stay up,</i>
<i>it's worth it. </i>

226
00:22:39,805 --> 00:22:42,137
<i>Be sure to find a good spot</i>
<i>where you can see the sky. </i>

227
00:22:43,942 --> 00:22:45,273
Ugh.

228
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:48,973
I'm so sick of hearing about
that stupid eclipse.

229
00:22:49,014 --> 00:22:51,915
It's like all anybody
can ever talk about.

230
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:53,508
They're like, "Oh, gosh.

231
00:22:53,552 --> 00:22:56,350
Are you gonna go see
the eclipse tonight? Buh. "

232
00:22:57,456 --> 00:22:59,481
Oh, God.

233
00:22:59,525 --> 00:23:02,824
You know, it's not like
the moon's gonna explode.

234
00:23:02,861 --> 00:23:06,592
Although that would be
pretty cool.

235
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:11,235
So do you want me
to come with you?

236
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:13,295
I don't have to see
Mark tonight.

237
00:23:13,338 --> 00:23:15,363
He hates me anyway.

238
00:23:15,407 --> 00:23:17,136
No, it's okay.

239
00:23:17,176 --> 00:23:20,339
But I feel a little weird,
you know,

240
00:23:20,379 --> 00:23:23,371
just dropping you out here
in, like,

241
00:23:23,415 --> 00:23:29,376
in the middle of Jabib
or wherever we are.

242
00:23:29,421 --> 00:23:32,652
I mean, I had to look at a map.

243
00:23:32,691 --> 00:23:33,749
Well, don't worry.

244
00:23:33,792 --> 00:23:34,781
I'm gonna be fine.

245
00:23:34,827 --> 00:23:36,089
Okay.

246
00:23:36,128 --> 00:23:40,155
Okay, but I have
to tell you something.

247
00:23:40,199 --> 00:23:43,532
But you got to promise that
you're not gonna get mad at me.

248
00:23:43,569 --> 00:23:44,695
What?

249
00:23:44,737 --> 00:23:46,034
You can't get mad at me.

250
00:23:46,071 --> 00:23:47,060
You got to promise.

251
00:23:47,106 --> 00:23:48,095
No.

252
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:49,164
No...

253
00:23:49,208 --> 00:23:50,470
I don't even know
what it is yet.

254
00:23:50,509 --> 00:23:54,502
God... okay.

255
00:23:59,551 --> 00:24:00,882
Where did you get these?

256
00:24:00,919 --> 00:24:02,011
I'm sorry.

257
00:24:02,054 --> 00:24:03,851
You were upset, and I felt bad.

258
00:24:03,889 --> 00:24:04,878
Megan!

259
00:24:04,923 --> 00:24:06,151
I know, I know.

260
00:24:06,191 --> 00:24:07,180
I'm sorry.

261
00:24:07,226 --> 00:24:08,250
But look, like,

262
00:24:08,293 --> 00:24:10,158
it was... it was like,

263
00:24:10,195 --> 00:24:11,856
he was such a jerk
for standing you up.

264
00:24:11,897 --> 00:24:13,023
Yes, he was.

265
00:24:13,065 --> 00:24:14,726
And you were super-bummed-out.

266
00:24:14,767 --> 00:24:15,859
You were.

267
00:24:15,901 --> 00:24:18,335
And, like, we had
a really good idea.

268
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:19,894
And I know that you
weren't gonna do it,

269
00:24:19,938 --> 00:24:21,132
so I had to do it, man.

270
00:24:21,173 --> 00:24:22,663
And I didn't know
he was gonna call you.

271
00:24:22,708 --> 00:24:23,766
How could I have known that?

272
00:24:23,809 --> 00:24:26,739
I'm sorry.

273
00:24:26,779 --> 00:24:30,510
Well, now I know why
I got the job.

274
00:24:30,549 --> 00:24:32,483
Nobody else called.

275
00:24:32,518 --> 00:24:34,748
Just please let me
stay with you.

276
00:24:34,787 --> 00:24:36,482
<i>Please let me stay with you.

277
00:24:36,522 --> 00:24:38,387
I will be so good.

278
00:24:38,423 --> 00:24:41,017
I won't touch anything
or eat their food.

279
00:24:41,059 --> 00:24:42,117
I won't take your money.

280
00:24:42,161 --> 00:24:43,253
I just... well, I'll be there,

281
00:24:43,295 --> 00:24:44,523
and we'll, like, hang out.

282
00:24:44,563 --> 00:24:47,396
Alright, okay, I heard you
the first fifty times.

283
00:24:47,432 --> 00:24:49,525
Oan I come then?

284
00:24:49,568 --> 00:24:51,468
Let's just wait
and see how it goes.

285
00:24:51,503 --> 00:24:53,494
They could be nice.
You don't know.

286
00:24:53,539 --> 00:24:54,733
No, I do know.

287
00:24:54,773 --> 00:24:56,604
Normal people do not pull
the kind of stuff

288
00:24:56,642 --> 00:24:58,234
that those people
pulled with you today.

289
00:24:58,277 --> 00:24:59,301
They just don't.

290
00:24:59,344 --> 00:25:00,641
Look who's talking.

291
00:25:00,679 --> 00:25:02,374
That's different.

292
00:25:02,414 --> 00:25:04,712
<i>People make mistakes.
It happens.

293
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:06,012
I mean, hey, they live

294
00:25:06,051 --> 00:25:07,643
all the way out here
in the country.

295
00:25:07,686 --> 00:25:09,085
So they're at least
normal enough

296
00:25:09,121 --> 00:25:10,850
to have real jobs
that pay tons of money.

297
00:25:10,889 --> 00:25:13,585
You think having lots of money
makes you normal?

298
00:25:13,625 --> 00:25:18,085
You've clearly never met
my family.

299
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:20,690
Well, we'll see.

300
00:25:21,967 --> 00:25:23,901
Yes, we will.

301
00:26:08,447 --> 00:26:09,937
Hey, yo, check it.

302
00:26:09,982 --> 00:26:12,849
Volvo.

303
00:26:12,885 --> 00:26:15,445
Safest car on the road.

304
00:26:23,528 --> 00:26:26,520
Holy crap.

305
00:26:55,794 --> 00:26:56,954
Hi.

306
00:26:56,995 --> 00:27:03,901
I'm Samantha,
the babysitter.

307
00:27:03,936 --> 00:27:06,734
This is my friend, Megan.

308
00:27:06,772 --> 00:27:08,399
Vincent Ulman.

309
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:12,103
Very nice to meet you both.

310
00:27:12,144 --> 00:27:14,339
Such beautiful girls.

311
00:27:15,614 --> 00:27:20,847
<i>Please come inside.

312
00:27:46,645 --> 00:27:49,637
Have a seat.

313
00:27:54,252 --> 00:27:56,652
You're a doll for agreeing
to this.

314
00:27:56,688 --> 00:27:58,053
I mean it.

315
00:27:58,090 --> 00:28:00,115
Oh, it's nothing, really.

316
00:28:00,158 --> 00:28:01,921
I can't tell you how much
of a relief it'll be

317
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:04,087
to get this night behind us.

318
00:28:04,129 --> 00:28:07,155
You know, we only arrived
in town very recently,

319
00:28:07,199 --> 00:28:09,326
and we really haven't had
a moment to spare,

320
00:28:09,368 --> 00:28:13,065
you know, what with the eclipse
and all.

321
00:28:13,105 --> 00:28:16,336
So are you a teacher
or something?

322
00:28:16,375 --> 00:28:18,138
No.

323
00:28:18,176 --> 00:28:19,939
I mean, not exactly.

324
00:28:19,978 --> 00:28:21,343
Just... did you know
both of you live

325
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:23,814
in one of the most perfect
places on Earth

326
00:28:23,849 --> 00:28:25,407
to get a clear view
of it tonight?

327
00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:29,477
We heard.

328
00:28:29,521 --> 00:28:32,979
Yeah, this place is quite
the astronomer's dream.

329
00:28:33,025 --> 00:28:35,323
Are you an astronomer?

330
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:38,386
No, not exactly.

331
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:40,295
Samantha, could I have
a word with you

332
00:28:40,332 --> 00:28:45,531
in the other room, please?

333
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:48,562
Um... sure.

334
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:16,824
I hope you don't have
a problem,

335
00:29:16,868 --> 00:29:19,894
but you have to understand
that I am only paying one person

336
00:29:19,938 --> 00:29:20,996
for their time.

337
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:23,132
Oh, yeah.

338
00:29:23,175 --> 00:29:24,938
No, Megan's not staying.

339
00:29:24,976 --> 00:29:26,375
She's just my ride.

340
00:29:26,411 --> 00:29:30,871
I don't have a car,
so she was just dropping me off.

341
00:29:30,916 --> 00:29:32,076
Oh, good.

342
00:29:33,418 --> 00:29:35,682
And please forgive me
for sounding rude.

343
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:40,748
It's just that my wife
is very on edge

344
00:29:40,792 --> 00:29:44,091
about this whole situation.

345
00:29:44,129 --> 00:29:45,187
You're not being rude.

346
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:49,132
I understand.

347
00:29:49,167 --> 00:29:52,364
Unfortunately, no,
I'm afraid you don't.

348
00:29:52,404 --> 00:29:54,201
Excuse me?

349
00:29:54,239 --> 00:29:56,730
<i>Please sit down.

350
00:31:03,375 --> 00:31:04,740
You have to forgive me,
Samantha,

351
00:31:04,776 --> 00:31:08,837
because I've not been
completely honest.

352
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:12,338
You see,
we actually don't have a child.

353
00:31:14,619 --> 00:31:16,610
We have a child, but he's grown.

354
00:31:16,655 --> 00:31:19,954
This job tonight
is not for a child

355
00:31:19,991 --> 00:31:21,652
but for my wife's mother.

356
00:31:22,928 --> 00:31:24,589
Oh.

357
00:31:24,629 --> 00:31:25,618
Hear me out.

358
00:31:25,664 --> 00:31:28,497
Mr. Ulman, um...

359
00:31:28,533 --> 00:31:30,967
I don't have any experience
with anything like that.

360
00:31:31,002 --> 00:31:32,492
I think maybe you should find...

361
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,468
Okay, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry.

362
00:31:36,508 --> 00:31:38,499
I didn't mean to...

363
00:31:40,812 --> 00:31:43,576
Listen, this is not anything
like you're imagining.

364
00:31:43,615 --> 00:31:45,105
There's nothing medical

365
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:46,583
that you would
have to do whatsoever.

366
00:31:46,618 --> 00:31:49,348
In fact, you don't have to do
much of anything and...

367
00:31:50,555 --> 00:31:52,045
I find this all a bit awkward.

368
00:31:52,090 --> 00:31:54,388
But you have to understand
I have only the best intentions.

369
00:31:54,426 --> 00:31:56,690
I've been putting advertisements
out for the past two weeks

370
00:31:56,728 --> 00:31:57,888
to get someone for tonight.

371
00:31:57,929 --> 00:31:59,624
But nobody responds
to elderly assistance

372
00:31:59,664 --> 00:32:01,131
or home care anymore.

373
00:32:01,166 --> 00:32:07,162
So I thought maybe "babysitter"
would get a better response.

374
00:32:07,205 --> 00:32:08,797
But to be honest,
it didn't do much.

375
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:11,809
And like I said on the phone,
I only got one other girl.

376
00:32:11,843 --> 00:32:16,337
And when I told her the truth,
she backed out, so...

377
00:32:16,381 --> 00:32:19,839
I'd figure
it's all the horror stories

378
00:32:19,884 --> 00:32:22,512
that you read in the paper
and see on TV

379
00:32:22,554 --> 00:32:26,388
that have scared away
girls of your age

380
00:32:26,424 --> 00:32:30,155
from these types
of opportunities.

381
00:32:30,195 --> 00:32:33,028
Yeah, there's a lot
of weirdos out there.

382
00:32:34,733 --> 00:32:37,626
You're right.

383
00:32:37,669 --> 00:32:39,660
And I sincerely apologize
for being dishonest,

384
00:32:39,704 --> 00:32:41,501
but what I'm asking of you
is not that different

385
00:32:41,539 --> 00:32:42,631
than what you expected.

386
00:32:42,674 --> 00:32:45,575
It's essentially
just like babysitting.

387
00:32:46,711 --> 00:32:47,700
I'm sorry.

388
00:32:47,746 --> 00:32:48,906
I appreciate your situation.

389
00:32:48,947 --> 00:32:49,971
I do.

390
00:32:50,015 --> 00:32:51,744
Okay, what would it take?

391
00:32:57,055 --> 00:33:02,254
How about if I gave you
another $100?

392
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:08,927
Okay, okay.

393
00:33:08,967 --> 00:33:11,299
$200.

394
00:33:11,336 --> 00:33:13,770
That's $300 for one night.

395
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,064
<i>Please.

396
00:33:16,107 --> 00:33:17,631
You have no idea
how important this is.

397
00:33:20,679 --> 00:33:23,671
$400.

398
00:33:32,123 --> 00:33:34,421
Hey!

399
00:33:34,459 --> 00:33:36,393
Megan!

400
00:33:36,428 --> 00:33:37,554
Jeez! Oome on!

401
00:33:37,595 --> 00:33:38,584
Hold on!

402
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:39,858
Megan.

403
00:33:39,898 --> 00:33:40,887
Oome on, wait a second.

404
00:33:40,932 --> 00:33:42,797
Are you out of your mind?

405
00:33:42,834 --> 00:33:44,096
Do you remember the game plan?

406
00:33:44,135 --> 00:33:45,898
The game plan was,
if they're weird, we leave.

407
00:33:45,937 --> 00:33:47,404
This is beyond weird.
It's mental.

408
00:33:47,439 --> 00:33:49,669
You know they lied to you.
They lied to you.

409
00:33:49,708 --> 00:33:51,073
- I know, okay.
- They're liars.

410
00:33:51,109 --> 00:33:52,235
I know you're right.

411
00:33:52,277 --> 00:33:53,505
But it's $400.

412
00:33:53,545 --> 00:33:57,208
It's $400 for four hours.

413
00:33:57,248 --> 00:33:58,977
This equals first month's rent
and then some,

414
00:33:59,017 --> 00:34:01,110
and all I have to do
is sit inside and watch TV.

415
00:34:01,152 --> 00:34:02,346
It's too good to be true.

416
00:34:02,387 --> 00:34:05,686
Did you ever think
it is too good to be true?

417
00:34:05,724 --> 00:34:06,952
Megan, please.

418
00:34:06,991 --> 00:34:08,856
I need the money.

419
00:34:08,893 --> 00:34:13,394
It's so stupid.

420
00:34:13,431 --> 00:34:16,195
Ugh.

421
00:34:16,234 --> 00:34:18,134
I'm so mad at you.

422
00:34:18,169 --> 00:34:20,194
Look, you're being
a great friend right now.

423
00:34:20,238 --> 00:34:21,603
But this is huge.

424
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:23,607
This one night changes
everything for me.

425
00:34:25,076 --> 00:34:26,270
Oome on.
It's only a few hours.

426
00:34:26,311 --> 00:34:27,903
That's it.

427
00:34:27,946 --> 00:34:30,278
Just promise me you'll be here
by 12:30, and then it's over.

428
00:34:30,315 --> 00:34:31,304
Just promise me.

429
00:34:31,349 --> 00:34:34,284
Okay, fine, fine.

430
00:34:34,319 --> 00:34:35,308
12:30, right?

431
00:34:35,353 --> 00:34:37,150
Okay, yeah.

432
00:35:21,332 --> 00:35:23,061
Oh, God, Sam.

433
00:35:23,101 --> 00:35:26,093
You can be such
a fucking idiot sometimes.

434
00:35:57,769 --> 00:36:00,464
Oh, my God!

435
00:36:00,505 --> 00:36:02,063
Oh, my gosh,
you scared the crap out of me.

436
00:36:02,106 --> 00:36:03,869
Take it easy.

437
00:36:03,908 --> 00:36:04,966
I'm sorry.

438
00:36:05,009 --> 00:36:06,636
I didn't mean to scare you.

439
00:36:06,678 --> 00:36:09,670
I just thought you could use
a light is all.

440
00:36:09,714 --> 00:36:11,682
So sue me for being helpful.

441
00:36:11,716 --> 00:36:13,149
I almost just died.

442
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:14,344
Oh, my God.

443
00:36:14,385 --> 00:36:16,080
I almost just had a heart attack
and died.

444
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:19,317
Here.
You do it.

445
00:36:19,357 --> 00:36:20,654
It's safer.

446
00:36:23,061 --> 00:36:26,053
Thanks.

447
00:36:30,635 --> 00:36:33,934
All better?

448
00:36:33,972 --> 00:36:36,964
Aces.

449
00:36:39,344 --> 00:36:43,280
It's freezing out here.

450
00:36:43,314 --> 00:36:46,306
Okay.

451
00:36:48,386 --> 00:36:50,286
Where the hell
did you come from?

452
00:36:50,321 --> 00:36:52,881
Did you just hide?

453
00:36:54,726 --> 00:36:57,718
Are you... are you not
the babysitter?

454
00:36:57,762 --> 00:36:59,821
No, I'm not the babysitter.
My friend...

455
00:37:40,038 --> 00:37:41,972
See, here we are.

456
00:37:42,006 --> 00:37:43,997
Half your payment in advance

457
00:37:44,042 --> 00:37:46,067
just to ease your mind.

458
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:48,135
And here's a little more
to get something to eat.

459
00:37:48,179 --> 00:37:49,612
There's a number
on the refrigerator

460
00:37:49,647 --> 00:37:51,205
for a pizza place.

461
00:37:51,249 --> 00:37:53,717
I know you college kids
love pizza.

462
00:37:53,751 --> 00:37:55,309
Mom is asleep,
and as I said before,

463
00:37:55,353 --> 00:37:57,378
there's really no need
for concern.

464
00:37:57,422 --> 00:38:00,823
She's old but she's actually
quite able-bodied.

465
00:38:00,858 --> 00:38:04,157
Actually,
more able-bodied than...

466
00:38:04,195 --> 00:38:05,253
than myself, I hate to say.

467
00:38:05,296 --> 00:38:06,957
But if she needs anything,

468
00:38:06,998 --> 00:38:08,192
she'll be able to get it
herself.

469
00:38:08,232 --> 00:38:09,256
She's quite independent.

470
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:10,790
Most likely
you won't even see her.

471
00:38:10,835 --> 00:38:12,200
But you need to be alert

472
00:38:12,236 --> 00:38:14,796
just in the off-chance
that there's an emergency.

473
00:38:14,839 --> 00:38:15,828
You understand?

474
00:38:15,873 --> 00:38:17,170
Mm-hmm.

475
00:38:17,208 --> 00:38:18,971
I mean, this is mostly
for my wife's benefit.

476
00:38:19,010 --> 00:38:21,240
She's, you know,
the paranoid type.

477
00:38:21,279 --> 00:38:22,337
But you get it.

478
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:24,644
It all sounds easy enough
to handle.

479
00:38:24,682 --> 00:38:25,671
Terrific.

480
00:38:25,717 --> 00:38:26,706
Oh, right.

481
00:38:26,751 --> 00:38:29,618
There's...

482
00:38:29,654 --> 00:38:31,781
it's the number where we'll be

483
00:38:31,823 --> 00:38:33,120
just in case you need us.

484
00:38:33,157 --> 00:38:36,285
Oh, yeah, there's a number
on fridge for pizz...

485
00:38:36,327 --> 00:38:37,954
I already said that, didn't I?

486
00:38:38,963 --> 00:38:40,055
Yeah.

487
00:38:40,098 --> 00:38:41,156
If this wasn't screwed on...

488
00:38:41,199 --> 00:38:43,724
but I've said too much as it is,

489
00:38:43,768 --> 00:38:46,828
so I'm gonna get upstairs
and get the missus.

490
00:38:46,871 --> 00:38:50,363
And you just make yourself
comfortable.

491
00:38:50,408 --> 00:38:53,275
And I'll be back in two shakes
of a lamb's tail.

492
00:38:53,311 --> 00:38:56,303
Okay, thanks.

493
00:39:17,702 --> 00:39:22,105
<i>I've done everything</i>
<i>you asked. </i>

494
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:25,974
<i>Well, there's not going to be</i>
<i>any more mistakes. </i>

495
00:39:26,010 --> 00:39:28,444
<i>No, this one, she's perfect. </i>

496
00:39:28,479 --> 00:39:29,776
<i>We're not missing a thing. </i>

497
00:39:29,814 --> 00:39:33,773
<i>After tonight, everything</i>
<i>will finally be complete. </i>

498
00:39:33,818 --> 00:39:36,480
<i>Please stop worrying. </i>

499
00:39:36,521 --> 00:39:41,288
<i>I have it all under control. </i>

500
00:40:01,112 --> 00:40:02,477
Are you here for mother?

501
00:40:02,513 --> 00:40:05,038
Yes, yes, I am.

502
00:40:05,083 --> 00:40:08,075
Wonderful.

503
00:40:11,255 --> 00:40:13,018
You're a godsend.

504
00:40:13,057 --> 00:40:15,116
It's nothing.

505
00:40:15,159 --> 00:40:19,118
Not to us, it's not.

506
00:40:19,163 --> 00:40:20,255
Well, I'm glad to do it.

507
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:23,997
Hmm.

508
00:40:25,970 --> 00:40:27,267
Vivian Ulman.

509
00:40:27,305 --> 00:40:28,294
Samantha.

510
00:40:28,339 --> 00:40:29,328
Sam.

511
00:40:29,373 --> 00:40:32,240
Nice to meet you.

512
00:40:33,244 --> 00:40:34,802
What's the matter, Sam?

513
00:40:34,846 --> 00:40:36,541
Oh, nothing.

514
00:40:36,581 --> 00:40:37,878
I just...

515
00:40:37,915 --> 00:40:41,043
I thought your husband
went upstairs looking for you,

516
00:40:41,085 --> 00:40:43,952
and I didn't expect to see you
come in from over there.

517
00:40:43,988 --> 00:40:46,980
I just... I get disoriented
sometimes.

518
00:40:47,024 --> 00:40:50,960
My friend Megan says
I'm out to lunch.

519
00:40:50,995 --> 00:40:52,292
I was downstairs
in the basement

520
00:40:52,330 --> 00:40:53,558
looking for my furs.

521
00:40:53,598 --> 00:40:56,726
I just can't get used
to this cold weather.

522
00:40:56,768 --> 00:40:59,032
I love the heat.

523
00:40:59,070 --> 00:41:00,731
We're from the desert, you know.

524
00:41:00,772 --> 00:41:01,796
Oh?

525
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:02,828
Mm-hmm.

526
00:41:02,874 --> 00:41:04,842
What about you?

527
00:41:04,876 --> 00:41:06,503
Is this your home?

528
00:41:06,544 --> 00:41:08,102
Yeah.

529
00:41:08,146 --> 00:41:10,671
Well, it's more downstate,
but it's pretty much the same.

530
00:41:10,715 --> 00:41:13,309
I don't like the cold
much either.

531
00:41:13,351 --> 00:41:15,012
And now you're in university.

532
00:41:15,052 --> 00:41:17,612
You look awfully young
to be in college.

533
00:41:17,655 --> 00:41:20,089
Everybody says that.

534
00:41:20,124 --> 00:41:21,614
But I'm a sophomore.

535
00:41:21,659 --> 00:41:23,456
Oh, a sophomore.

536
00:41:23,494 --> 00:41:25,121
Wow.

537
00:41:25,163 --> 00:41:28,030
You could have fooled me.

538
00:41:28,065 --> 00:41:30,829
I bet the boys really like you.

539
00:41:30,868 --> 00:41:31,994
I guess.

540
00:41:32,036 --> 00:41:33,401
Hmm, you guess.

541
00:41:33,437 --> 00:41:36,600
Of course they do.

542
00:41:36,641 --> 00:41:39,166
A fine young beauty like you.

543
00:41:39,210 --> 00:41:43,340
I remember when I was your age.

544
00:41:43,381 --> 00:41:46,908
Your mother must
worry herself silly.

545
00:41:52,323 --> 00:41:55,315
Here we go.

546
00:42:02,066 --> 00:42:04,227
Ah, you two have met.

547
00:42:04,268 --> 00:42:06,896
Excellent.

548
00:42:06,938 --> 00:42:10,032
Yes, and she's delightful.

549
00:42:10,074 --> 00:42:11,234
I couldn't be more pleased,

550
00:42:11,275 --> 00:42:12,833
and I know that mother
will feel the same.

551
00:42:12,877 --> 00:42:14,105
Good, very good.

552
00:42:14,145 --> 00:42:17,603
You see, things are working out
perfectly after all.

553
00:42:17,648 --> 00:42:18,740
And you doubted me.

554
00:42:18,783 --> 00:42:20,341
I know.

555
00:42:20,384 --> 00:42:22,409
You were right, and I was wrong.

556
00:42:22,453 --> 00:42:24,318
I'm sorry.

557
00:42:24,355 --> 00:42:26,118
Well, then let's get to it.

558
00:42:26,157 --> 00:42:28,682
Mustn't let the night
get away from us.

559
00:42:28,726 --> 00:42:29,954
Isn't that right, Samantha?

560
00:42:29,994 --> 00:42:32,019
That's right.

561
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:35,157
Oh, and mother
is very private.

562
00:42:35,199 --> 00:42:36,826
So don't be put off by it.

563
00:42:36,868 --> 00:42:38,199
It's just her way.

564
00:42:38,236 --> 00:42:39,464
Don't worry.

565
00:42:39,503 --> 00:42:41,994
I warned her about both of you.

566
00:42:45,643 --> 00:42:49,477
You did, did you?

567
00:42:54,151 --> 00:42:56,346
Oh, yeah, don't forget
the pizza on the refrigerator.

568
00:44:23,441 --> 00:44:24,430
<i>Hello?</i>

569
00:44:24,475 --> 00:44:25,669
Hey.

570
00:44:25,710 --> 00:44:29,339
<i>Oh, I'm not actually here. </i>

571
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:32,247
<i>But leave me a message,</i>
<i>and I'll call you right back. </i>

572
00:44:52,069 --> 00:44:53,832
<i>Hello?</i>

573
00:44:53,871 --> 00:44:57,204
<i>Oh, I'm not actually here. </i>

574
00:44:57,241 --> 00:45:00,335
<i>But leave me a message,</i>
<i>and I'll call you right back. </i>

575
00:45:01,412 --> 00:45:04,745
Megan, it's me.
<i>Pick up.

576
00:45:04,782 --> 00:45:07,979
You're still not home yet?

577
00:45:08,019 --> 00:45:11,921
Sorry if you're mad.

578
00:45:11,956 --> 00:45:13,184
Alright, I'll call you back.

579
00:45:13,224 --> 00:45:14,748
It's not that bad.

580
00:45:14,792 --> 00:45:16,783
Just hurry up and be home.

581
00:46:14,452 --> 00:46:16,010
<i>Pizza Pizza,</i>
<i>whatchya eating?</i>

582
00:46:16,053 --> 00:46:17,247
Yeah, hi.

583
00:46:17,288 --> 00:46:19,381
I'd like to place an order
for delivery.

584
00:46:19,423 --> 00:46:23,018
<i>Okay, your address?</i>

585
00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:25,722
Uh, one second.

586
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:35,436
Uh, it is 7714 East Beaumont.

587
00:46:35,473 --> 00:46:37,236
<i>East Beaumont?</i>

588
00:46:37,274 --> 00:46:39,401
<i>Very cool. </i>

589
00:46:39,443 --> 00:46:41,035
<i>What can I get for you?</i>

590
00:46:41,078 --> 00:46:42,170
<i>Extra anchovies?</i>

591
00:46:43,347 --> 00:46:45,747
No, just a small pizza
with pepperoni.

592
00:46:45,783 --> 00:46:47,148
<i>We don't have small. </i>

593
00:46:47,184 --> 00:46:48,708
<i>Only medium and large. </i>

594
00:46:48,752 --> 00:46:50,617
Okay, medium is fine.

595
00:46:50,654 --> 00:46:52,087
<i>Alright. </i>

596
00:46:52,123 --> 00:46:54,648
<i>One medium pepp. </i>

597
00:46:54,692 --> 00:46:57,684
<i>That's going to be eight bucks. </i>

598
00:46:57,728 --> 00:46:59,059
Okay, thank you.

599
00:46:59,096 --> 00:47:00,723
<i>No, thank you. </i>

600
00:47:00,764 --> 00:47:03,756
<i>See you in 30.</i>

601
00:51:07,611 --> 00:51:09,602
Hello, fish.

602
00:54:06,657 --> 00:54:08,022
<i>Good evening. </i>
<i>I'm Elaine Cross. </i>

603
00:54:08,058 --> 00:54:09,286
<i>And I'm Ted Stephen. </i>

604
00:54:09,326 --> 00:54:11,556
<i>And welcome back</i>
<i>to Channel 13 News. </i>

605
00:54:11,595 --> 00:54:14,723
<i>Tonight's big eclipse</i>
<i>is now well under way. </i>

606
00:54:14,765 --> 00:54:16,198
<i>It is a total lunar eclipse,</i>

607
00:54:16,233 --> 00:54:20,135
<i>which I'm told means up to</i>
<i>two hours of no moon visibility. </i>

608
00:54:20,170 --> 00:54:21,330
<i>More than half the moon</i>

609
00:54:21,371 --> 00:54:23,430
<i>has already entered</i>
<i>the Earth's shadow. </i>

610
00:54:23,473 --> 00:54:25,498
<i>Observers from all over</i>
<i>the western hemisphere</i>

611
00:54:25,542 --> 00:54:27,806
<i>are watching</i>
<i>this spectacular event. </i>

612
00:54:27,844 --> 00:54:30,039
<i>In fact, it's visible</i>
<i>from every continent</i>

613
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:32,207
<i>this side of the globe,</i>
<i>except Antarctica. </i>

614
00:54:32,249 --> 00:54:34,240
<i>The best time to see</i>
<i>this fascinating event</i>

615
00:54:34,284 --> 00:54:36,252
<i>will be just about</i>
<i>the stroke of midnight. </i>

616
00:54:36,286 --> 00:54:38,186
<i>That's when you'll be able</i>
<i>to see the moon itself</i>

617
00:54:38,221 --> 00:54:40,815
<i>actually disappear</i>
<i>into the Earth's shadow. </i>

618
00:54:40,857 --> 00:54:42,324
<i>And that's it for us tonight. </i>

619
00:54:42,359 --> 00:54:44,020
<i>Stay tuned</i>
<i>for a special presentation</i>

620
00:54:44,061 --> 00:54:46,461
<i>Of Frightmare Theatre</i>
coming up next.

621
00:54:46,496 --> 00:54:47,485
<i>Ooh, scary. </i>

622
00:54:47,531 --> 00:54:48,520
<i>Good night for a movie. </i>

623
00:54:48,565 --> 00:54:50,032
<i>Get the popcorn ready. </i>

624
00:54:50,067 --> 00:54:52,729
<i>I like mine with butter. </i>

625
00:55:36,279 --> 00:55:39,612
# <i>The deception with tact,</i> #

626
00:55:39,650 --> 00:55:43,086
<i>#just what are</i>
<i>you trying to say?</i> #

627
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:46,988
# <i>You've got a blank face</i>
<i>which irritates. </i> #

628
00:55:47,024 --> 00:55:48,013
# <i>Communicate. </i> #

629
00:55:48,058 --> 00:55:49,855
# <i>Pull out your party piece. </i> #

630
00:55:49,893 --> 00:55:54,023
# <i>You see dimensions in two. </i> #

631
00:55:54,064 --> 00:55:57,090
# <i>State your case</i>
<i>with black or white. </i> #

632
00:55:57,134 --> 00:55:59,932
# <i>But when one little cross</i>
<i>leads to shots,</i> #

633
00:55:59,970 --> 00:56:01,437
# <i>grit your teeth. </i> #

634
00:56:01,471 --> 00:56:03,439
# <i>You run for cover</i>
<i>so discreet. </i> #

635
00:56:03,473 --> 00:56:06,306
# <i>Why don't they</i>
<i>do what they say,</i> #

636
00:56:06,343 --> 00:56:07,867
# <i>say what you mean?</i> #

637
00:56:07,911 --> 00:56:10,846
# <i>One thing leads to another. </i> #

638
00:56:10,881 --> 00:56:12,041
# <i>You told me something wrong. </i> #

639
00:56:12,082 --> 00:56:13,777
# <i>I know I listened too long. </i> #

640
00:56:13,817 --> 00:56:18,254
# <i>But then one thing</i>
<i>leads to another. </i> #

641
00:56:20,724 --> 00:56:22,248
# <i>But the long face</i>
<i>that you sell</i> #

642
00:56:22,292 --> 00:56:25,159
# <i>passes in and out</i>
<i>like a scent,</i> #

643
00:56:25,195 --> 00:56:27,060
# <i>but the long face</i> #

644

# <i>that you see</i> #

645
00:56:29,199 --> 00:56:32,396

646
00:56:32,436 --> 00:56:33,960
# <i>If this is up,</i>

647
00:56:34,004 --> 00:56:36,564
# <i>But you're running</i>
<i>out of sight. </i> #

648
00:56:36,606 --> 00:56:39,040
# <i>You've seen your name</i>

Man...

662
00:57:34,598 --> 00:57:36,589
Frickin' idiot!

663
00:58:04,594 --> 00:58:07,654
Huh.

664
00:58:11,568 --> 00:58:14,560
I thought she said
these were in the basement.

665
00:58:44,301 --> 00:58:46,166
Hey, yo, check it.

666
00:58:46,203 --> 00:58:48,398
Volvo.

667

670
01:01:02,539 --> 01:01:05,599
Get a grip.

671
01:02:26,389 --> 01:02:31,292
Hello?

672
01:02:31,327 --> 01:02:34,524
Mrs. Ulman?

673
01:02:34,564 --> 01:02:37,556
Shit.

674
01:03:52,308 --> 01:03:56,301
Is everything alright
in there?

675
01:05:29,772 --> 01:05:31,467
Keep the change.

676
01:05:35,478 --> 01:05:36,968
Have a good night, ma'am.

677
01:05:37,013 --> 01:05:40,176
You, too.

682
01:07:03,199 --> 01:07:04,757
It's okay.

683
01:07:04,801 --> 01:07:06,393
Everything's fine.

684
01:07:06,436 --> 01:07:08,802
She's fine.

685
01:07:08,838 --> 01:07:12,069
Just relax.

686
01:07:12,108 --> 01:07:15,305
Just get a grip.

687
01:07:15,345 --> 01:07:16,903
Get a grip.

688
01:07:21,250 --> 01:07:22,239
Megan?

689

<i>This is Gloria</i>

I'm sorry.

692
01:07:29,726 --> 01:07:32,217
I thought I hung up

693
01:07:32,261 --> 01:07:35,389
<i>Do you have an emergency?</i>

694
01:07:35,431 --> 01:07:36,625
No.

695
01:07:36,666 --> 01:07:37,655
Everything is fine.

696
01:07:37,700 --> 01:07:39,725
I didn't mean to call.

697
01:07:39,769 --> 01:07:40,895

Yeah, I know.

701
01:07:46,042 --> 01:07:47,031
It was an accident.

702
01:07:47,076 --> 01:07:48,065
I'm sorry.

703
01:07:48,111 --> 01:07:50,477

704
01:07:50,513 --> 01:07:53,505
Thanks.

705
01:09:34,784 --> 01:09:37,776
Ugh.

706
01:12:27,356 --> 01:12:28,721
Ugh.

707
01:19:34,383 --> 01:19:36,611
Get her!

708
01:19:52,267 --> 01:19:55,325
My eye!

709
01:20:04,046 --> 01:20:07,038
Megan!

710
01:20:16,158 --> 01:20:18,592
Ah!

711
01:22:19,214 --> 01:22:21,978
There you are.

712
01:22:22,184 --> 01:22:24,943
Get up!

713
01:22:31,260 --> 01:22:32,818
It's happening.

714
01:22:32,861 --> 01:22:34,761
No matter what you do,
it won't stop.

715
01:22:34,796 --> 01:22:36,787
It can't be stopped.

716
01:22:36,832 --> 01:22:38,891
You'll see.

717
01:22:38,934 --> 01:22:41,926
It's gonna work in spite of you,
you little bitch.

718
01:22:52,614 --> 01:22:54,582
Talk to me, Lord.

719
01:22:54,616 --> 01:22:56,481
Talk to me.

720
01:22:56,518 --> 01:22:57,985
<i>Please.

721
01:23:00,322 --> 01:23:02,654
Talk to me.

722
01:23:02,691 --> 01:23:04,955
<i>Please, Lord.

723
01:23:04,993 --> 01:23:09,657
I beg you.

724
01:24:30,011 --> 01:24:32,605
Samantha! Wait!

725
01:25:22,931 --> 01:25:24,796
Samantha! Listen to me.

726
01:25:24,833 --> 01:25:25,822
Get away from me!

727
01:25:25,867 --> 01:25:26,856
Just stop.

728
01:25:26,902 --> 01:25:28,028
Just speak with me.

729
01:25:28,069 --> 01:25:29,969
Stay back!

730
01:25:30,005 --> 01:25:31,529
Alright.

731
01:25:31,573 --> 01:25:33,370
You don't need to do that.

732
01:25:35,210 --> 01:25:40,079
What have you done to me?

733
01:25:41,149 --> 01:25:42,411
They're calling to you.

734
01:25:42,451 --> 01:25:44,783
Just listen to them.

735
01:25:51,226 --> 01:25:52,215
He's given the sign.

736
01:25:52,260 --> 01:25:54,319
He's chosen you.

737
01:25:54,362 --> 01:25:56,159
It's your destiny to accept Him.

738
01:25:56,198 --> 01:25:57,460
No!

739
01:26:01,036 --> 01:26:02,025
Okay, go ahead.

740
01:26:02,070 --> 01:26:03,059
Go ahead.

741
01:26:03,104 --> 01:26:04,571
Kill me if you want.

742
01:26:04,606 --> 01:26:08,235
I'm just a messenger
who carries out His words.

743
01:26:12,514 --> 01:26:16,416
Only moments away now.

744
01:26:26,761 --> 01:26:27,921
No, no!
