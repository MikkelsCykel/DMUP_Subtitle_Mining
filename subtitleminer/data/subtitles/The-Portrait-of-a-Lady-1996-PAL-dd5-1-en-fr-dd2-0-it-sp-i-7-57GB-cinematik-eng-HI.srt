00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,073
(Woman ) 'The best part of a kiss,
I think,

3
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,958
'is when you see that head
coming towards you

4
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:21,838
'and you know
that you're going to get kissed.

5
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,515
'That moment just before
is so exquisite.'

6
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,195
(second woman ) 'I'd never felt
the touch of another person my age.

7
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,236
'The sensation flew through me.'

8
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,993
(Third woman ) 'I love it.
I love kissing.'

9
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:38,596
(Fourth woman ) 'We were addicted to
that being entwined with each other,

10
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:42,639
'whether it was really positive
or negative.'

11
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:46,918
(Fifth woman ) 'I get this intense
look that says "I'm so mysterious,

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,879
"'and there's so much more to me
than meets the eye to find out..."'

13
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:51,915
(Giggling)

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,070
(sixth woman ) 'I believe in fate,

15
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,709
'so that person will find me,
or we'll find each other somehow.'

16
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:02,191
(seventh woman ) 'It means finding
a mirror, the clearest mirror

17
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,635
'and the most loyal mirror,

18
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,350
'so when I love that person, I know
that they'll shine that back to me.'

19
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,635
There's one thing more, Miss Archer.

20
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:21,599
You know,
if you don't like Lockleigh,

21
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,070
if you think it's too damp
or anything of that sort,

22
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:28,152
you need never go
within 50 miles of it.

23
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:31,994
It's not damp, by the way. I've had
the house thoroughly examined,

24
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,834
and it's perfectly safe,
but if you shouldn't fancy it,

25
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,070
you needn't dream of living in it.

26
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,355
There's no difficulty about that.

27
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,635
I've plenty of houses.

28
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,276
I thought to let you know.

29
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,554
some people don't like a moat,
you know.

30
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,910
I adore a moat.

31
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,956
I'm very sure you know...

32
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,593
I don't go off easily...

33
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,753
but when I'm touched,
it's for life, Miss Archer.

34
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,990
It's for life.

35
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,231
(Dogs bark)

36
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,675
Look, here comes Miss Archer.

37
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:29,318
(Woman ) No... she's going up
to the house.

38
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:33,154
(second woman ) so she is.
Where is Lord Warburton?

39
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,276
He was with her.

40
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,113
Bunchie, go back. Back.

41
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,997
(Whispering)

42
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,715
shall I sit with you
until dinner, Daddy?

43
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:21,429
I would like that, but Isabel
has asked to talk with me.

44
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,509
(Knock on door)

45
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,273
Come in, my dear.

46
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,435
Do sit down. Hmm?

47
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,395
(Coughs )

48
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,749
Ahem.

49
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,472
Uncle, I...

50
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,790
I ought to let you know that...

51
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:55,111
Lord Warburton has asked me
to marry him.

52
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,713
Well!

53
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,951
I told you you'd be
a success over here.

54
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,474
Americans are highly appreciated...

55
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,835
and you're very beautiful, you know.

56
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,229
0h, yes, of course. I'm lovely.

57
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,309
I...

58
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:18,391
I know it seems tasteless
and ungrateful...

59
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:23,154
but I can't marry him.

60
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,954
You didn't find his proposal
sufficiently attractive?

61
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,758
It was attractive.

62
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:35,437
There was a moment when I would have
given my little finger to say yes,

63
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,988
but...

64
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,153
I think I have to begin by getting
a general impression of life.

65
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,196
Do you see?

66
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,034
And there's a light that has to dawn.

67
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,310
I can't explain it, but...

68
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,436
I know it's there.

69
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,832
I'm not afraid, you know.

70
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,070
He's a very fine man.

71
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,720
He earns 100,000 a year...

72
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,758
about half a dozen houses
to live in...

73
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:14,197
and a seat in Parliament
as I have one at my own dinner table.

74
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,077
Well...

75
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,232
I hope very much
I have no more offers.

76
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,390
They upset me completely.

77
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,314
Isabel, your uncle is quite right.

78
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:28,995
You certainly cannot go to London
without a proper escort.

79
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,674
Well, my friend Henrietta
will be with me.

80
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:34,399
Your friend sounds rather bohemian,

81
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:37,153
and no doubt she will want to stay
at a boarding house.

82
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:40,755
Ralph has put you down at his club.

83
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,671
With Ralph, you can go anywhere.

84
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,910
Isn't anything proper here?

85
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,719
You're too fond
of your own ways, miss.

86
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,756
Yes, I'm very fond of them.

87
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,198
Isabel, I do not expect you
to always heed my advice.

88
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,113
But as you have
neither mother nor father,

89
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:01,636
I do expect you to listen to it.

90
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,118
(Driver) Hup, hup, hup.

91
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:19,636
(Ralph ) shall I love
your reporter friend or hate her?

92
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:22,553
Whichever you do will matter
little to Henrietta.

93
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:25,598
she doesn't care a straw
what men think of her.

94
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,593
- Will she interview me?
- You're not important enough.

95
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,352
Henrietta!

96
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:49,189
- so sad.
- Morbid, isn't it?

97
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,919
(Whistle )

98
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,875
When I wrote to you from Liverpool,

99
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:02,111
I said I had something
in particular to tell you.

100
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,195
You haven't asked me what it is yet.

101
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,675
Is it because you suspected?

102
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,069
Mmm... suspected what?

103
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,991
What have you to tell me?

104
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,914
What I have to tell you
is about your American admirer.

105
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,357
Mr Goodwood has come over
on the steamer with me.

106
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,476
0h!

107
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,516
You say that right.

108
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,436
He's come after you.

109
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,151
Did he tell you so?

110
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,389
No.

111
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,516
He told me...nothing.

112
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,354
- But I spoke of you a great deal.
- I'm sorry you did that.

113
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,989
0h, no. It was a pleasure to me.
I like the way he listened.

114
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,520
He was so quiet,

115
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,192
so intense.

116
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,918
He drank it all in.

117
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,116
He thinks too well of me already.

118
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,156
He oughtn't be encouraged.

119
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,834
He's dying
for a little encouragement.

120
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,558
shh!

121
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,628
I can see his face now.

122
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:08,234
And his look while we talked.

123
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,790
I... I've never seen an ugly man
look so handsome.

124
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,468
He's very simple-minded...

125
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,516
and he's not so ugly.

126
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:24,433
Does your cousin go around all day
with his hands in his pockets?

127
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,670
What does he do for a living?

128
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:29,593
He's terribly ill.
He's quite unfit for work.

129
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,477
Don't you believe it.

130
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,551
I work when I'm sick.

131
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:38,473
I should like to show him up.
He'd make a beautiful specimen.

132
00:10:43,591 --> 00:10:46,947
(Ralph ) Daddy and I lived here
when he worked at the bank.

133
00:10:47,031 --> 00:10:48,987
We don't use it now.

134
00:10:50,551 --> 00:10:54,021
(Isabel) I love this time of day,
just as it gets dark.

135
00:10:55,511 --> 00:10:57,467
Don't you?

136
00:10:58,111 --> 00:10:59,988
- Ralph?
- Huh?

137
00:11:04,471 --> 00:11:08,862
- May I light a cigarette?
- You may do what you please,

138
00:11:08,951 --> 00:11:11,101
as long as you'll amuse me.

139
00:11:12,191 --> 00:11:13,749
(Ralph clears throat)

140
00:11:16,751 --> 00:11:20,027
What had you in mind
when you refused Warburton?

141
00:11:21,631 --> 00:11:24,748
I have his leave to let you know
he has told me.

142
00:11:25,831 --> 00:11:26,946
Did...?

143
00:11:27,031 --> 00:11:29,420
Did he ask you to talk to me?

144
00:11:29,511 --> 00:11:32,230
No, not that. He...

145
00:11:32,311 --> 00:11:34,745
told me because
he couldn't help it.

146
00:11:34,831 --> 00:11:38,221
We're old friends,
and he was very heavy-hearted.

147
00:11:40,871 --> 00:11:43,829
What had I in mind
when I refused him?

148
00:11:46,311 --> 00:11:48,871
What logic dictated
so remarkable an act?

149
00:11:48,951 --> 00:11:51,306
Why do you call it remarkable?

150
00:11:51,391 --> 00:11:54,463
As a man, Warburton
is hardly at fault.

151
00:11:54,551 --> 00:11:57,702
I refused him because
he was too perfect, then.

152
00:12:02,111 --> 00:12:06,707
If you've really given Warburton
his final answer, I'm rather glad.

153
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:10,704
I don't mean I'm glad for you,
and still less, of course, for him.

154
00:12:10,791 --> 00:12:12,747
I'm glad for myself.

155
00:12:17,551 --> 00:12:19,906
Are you thinking of proposing to me?

156
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:25,386
What I mean
is that I shall have the thrill

157
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:30,386
of seeing what a young lady does
who won't marry Lord Warburton.

158
00:12:33,871 --> 00:12:35,827
You asked about logic.

159
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:38,747
I'll tell you.

160
00:12:40,231 --> 00:12:43,268
- It's that I can't escape my fate.
- Your fate?

161
00:12:46,311 --> 00:12:48,302
It's not my fate to give up.

162
00:12:48,391 --> 00:12:51,110
You call marrying Lord Warburton
giving up?

163
00:12:51,191 --> 00:12:54,740
It's getting a great deal,
but it's giving up other chances.

164
00:12:54,831 --> 00:12:56,742
Chances for what?

165
00:12:57,991 --> 00:13:01,142
I don't mean chances to marry.
I mean...

166
00:13:02,831 --> 00:13:04,662
from life...

167
00:13:05,831 --> 00:13:08,629
from the usual chances and dangers.

168
00:13:12,951 --> 00:13:15,226
You've answered my question.

169
00:13:15,311 --> 00:13:17,984
It seems to me
I've told you very little.

170
00:13:18,071 --> 00:13:20,107
You've told me the great thing.

171
00:13:20,191 --> 00:13:23,786
The world interests you.
You want to throw yourself into it.

172
00:13:23,871 --> 00:13:28,422
- I never said that.
- You meant it. Don't repudiate it.

173
00:13:28,511 --> 00:13:30,467
It's so fine.

174
00:13:35,351 --> 00:13:37,387
(Crowd cheering)

175
00:13:41,431 --> 00:13:45,982
(Barker) There he is,
the Great santini.

176
00:13:46,071 --> 00:13:48,824
(Man ) Go on. Pull!

177
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:51,345
Pull! Pull!

178
00:13:51,431 --> 00:13:53,387
(santini roars )

179
00:14:17,311 --> 00:14:19,825
How did you know I was here?

180
00:14:19,911 --> 00:14:22,027
Miss stackpole let me know.

181
00:14:24,711 --> 00:14:26,861
That is not kind of her.

182
00:14:28,511 --> 00:14:32,345
You said you hoped never to hear
from me again. I know that.

183
00:14:32,431 --> 00:14:34,945
But I never accepted
any such rule as my own.

184
00:14:35,031 --> 00:14:37,499
I didn't say I hoped
never to hear from you.

185
00:14:37,591 --> 00:14:41,140
Not for five years, then.
Ten, twenty, it's the same thing.

186
00:14:42,231 --> 00:14:45,223
What good do you expect
to get by insisting?

187
00:14:47,271 --> 00:14:49,387
I disgust you very much.

188
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:51,029
Yes.

189
00:14:51,911 --> 00:14:54,630
You don't at all delight me.

190
00:14:54,711 --> 00:14:58,226
You don't fit in,
not in any way. Not now.

191
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:03,024
Think of me or not.
0nly leave me alone.

192
00:15:04,071 --> 00:15:06,027
Until when?

193
00:15:07,911 --> 00:15:10,300
For a year...or two.

194
00:15:11,951 --> 00:15:14,590
Well, which?
Between one year and two,

195
00:15:14,671 --> 00:15:17,424
there's all the difference
in the world.

196
00:15:18,631 --> 00:15:20,587
Call it two, then.

197
00:15:23,711 --> 00:15:27,021
You'll marry someone else
as sure as I stand here.

198
00:15:27,111 --> 00:15:29,830
I don't wish to be
a mere sheep in the flock.

199
00:15:29,911 --> 00:15:31,867
I shall probably never marry.

200
00:15:31,951 --> 00:15:33,145
(God.)

201
00:15:33,231 --> 00:15:37,224
If you hear it rumoured I'm near
marrying, remember what I've said...

202
00:15:38,471 --> 00:15:40,427
and doubt it.

203
00:15:43,671 --> 00:15:45,787
I hate to lose sight of you.

204
00:15:54,751 --> 00:15:56,389
Goodbye.

205
00:16:20,911 --> 00:16:22,344
Hmm.

206
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:30,424
(sighs )

207
00:17:58,111 --> 00:18:00,067
(Ralph ) I love you.

208
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,829
You acted very wrongly.

209
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:43,117
You don't mean to tell me
you've sent him off?

210
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,158
I asked him to leave me alone,

211
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,118
and I ask you the same, Henrietta.

212
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,316
If you marry one of these people,

213
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:54,392
I'll never speak to you again.

214
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,516
You better wait till I'm asked.

215
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,751
0h, you'll be asked quick enough.

216
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,549
Annie Climber was asked
three times in Italy.

217
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,949
Poor, plain, little Annie.

218
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:10,272
Well, if Annie Climber
wasn't captured, why should I be?

219
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:14,148
Well, I don't believe
Annie was pressed, but you'll be.

220
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,591
Do you know where you're going,
Isabel Archer?

221
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,830
No, and it's very pleasant not to.

222
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:25,718
You're drifting off
to some great mistake.

223
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,756
You make me shudder.

224
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,951
(Man coughing)

225
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:38,312
My father's had an attack
of his old malady.

226
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,233
It's quite severe,
I'm afraid. (Coughs )

227
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,952
By great good luck,
Dr Matthew Hope is in town,

228
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:49,589
and I shall make sure of
his coming down to Gardencourt.

229
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:53,274
There's...an express train at 2.45,

230
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,318
and you shall come with me or not,
as you prefer.

231
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,597
I shall go with you. I'll pack now.

232
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,156
(sighs )

233
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,876
I'm not at peace about Isabel.

234
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:13,397
I fear she may marry one of these
Europeans, and I want to prevent it.

235
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,352
What a rage you have
for organising people.

236
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:21,159
I simply want her to marry
Mr Caspar Goodwood.

237
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:24,118
He's followed her
all the way from Boston.

238
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,079
He was here, last night.

239
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,071
- (Dishes shatter)
- In Pratt's?

240
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:33,914
Mmm. It was a little plot of mine.

241
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,351
Is she very fond of him?

242
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,590
If she isn't, she ought to be.

243
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,955
He's simply wrapped up in her.

244
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:47,114
Three months ago, she gave him every
reason to suspect he was acceptable,

245
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,795
and it's not really of Isabel
to go back on a friend

246
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,111
simply because
she's changed the scene.

247
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:58,193
(Tapping glass ) Isabel...was cruel?

248
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,271
she gave him no satisfaction.

249
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,954
Her only idea was to be rid of him.

250
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,877
(Ralph ) Poor Mr Goodwood.

251
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,276
(Barking)

252
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,076
(Glasses clinking)

253
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:44,318
sir Matthew, he had some kind
of seizure last night,

254
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,834
but I feel a dreadful
cold coming on.

255
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:49,639
- You will leave me a powder?
- 0f course.

256
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:54,472
0h, my great friend from Rome
has arrived.

257
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,710
You will stay for tea?

258
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,756
(Muffled piano playing)

259
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,394
(Piano playing continues behind door)

260
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:50,280
It's very beautiful,

261
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:54,558
and your playing makes it
more beautiful still.

262
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,632
You don't think I disturbed
Mr Touchett, then?

263
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:01,429
His room is so far away,
and I play just...

264
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,511
just un peu des doigts.

265
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:08,750
No, I...I should think
that to hear such lovely music

266
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:11,070
would make him feel better.

267
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,515
I'm afraid there are moments in life

268
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,637
when even schubert
has nothing to say to us.

269
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:28,191
Would...would you
play something more?

270
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:32,795
If it will
give you pleasure, delighted.

271
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:37,072
(starts playing)

272
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:41,869
(stops playing) Are you the niece,
the young American?

273
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:46,590
- I'm my aunt's niece.
- C'est bon. We're compatriots.

274
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,636
I'm Madame Merle.

275
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,836
(starts playing)

276
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,437
(Dog panting)

277
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,716
(snores lightly )

278
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,398
Mmm.

279
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,192
(Door closes )

280
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,350
Who's that with me?

281
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,396
Is it my son?

282
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,116
Yes, it's your son, Daddy.

283
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,919
- Is there no one else?
- No one else.

284
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,752
Cigarette.

285
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:16,428
What you should do when I'm gone

286
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,476
is to marry.

287
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,270
What do you think of your cousin?

288
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:31,350
Do I...do I understand you to propose
that I should marry Isabel?

289
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,876
Well, that's what
it comes to in the end.

290
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,030
Don't you like Isabel?

291
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:41,073
Yes, very much.
I like Isabel very much.

292
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:44,550
- I've thought a great deal about it.
- so have I.

293
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,596
I don't mind telling you that.

294
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,636
You're in love with her, then?

295
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,918
I should think you would be.
It's as if she came over on purpose.

296
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:01,713
No, I'm not in love with her, but...

297
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:06,873
I should be, if...
certain things were different.

298
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:10,949
Things are always different
from what they might be.

299
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,476
I shall not live many years...

300
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:19,916
but I hope long enough to see
what Isabel does with herself.

301
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,037
I should like
to do something for her.

302
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:26,430
- I should like to make her rich.
- What do you mean by rich?

303
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,476
I call people rich

304
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:32,439
when they're able to meet the
requirements of their imagination.

305
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,476
To do what she likes with it?

306
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,630
Absolutely what she likes.

307
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:40,394
Good boy.

308
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,391
You win.

309
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,192
Down.

310
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,236
Who is this Madame Merle?

311
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:54,475
she's very charming.

312
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,994
she plays beautifully.

313
00:27:57,080 --> 00:28:00,834
- she does everything beautifully.
- You don't like her.

314
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:03,434
0n the contrary,
I was once in love with her.

315
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,988
And she didn't care for you?

316
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,991
That's why you don't like her?

317
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,674
How can we have
discussed such things?

318
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,876
Monsieur Merle was then living.

319
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,235
Is he dead now?

320
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:17,038
so she says.

321
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,076
Don't you believe her?

322
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,834
Yes, because...

323
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:26,754
the husband of Madame Merle
would be likely to pass away.

324
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,396
(Mme Merle ) Am I late?

325
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,596
I do apologise.

326
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,636
No, not at all.

327
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,233
Are you aware of the beautiful
walking paths round the estate?

328
00:28:45,089 --> 00:28:49,048
(Merle ) Americans certainly
make poor Europeans.

329
00:28:50,129 --> 00:28:52,723
We've no natural place here.

330
00:28:52,809 --> 00:28:56,688
But a woman, it seems to me,
has no natural place anywhere.

331
00:28:56,769 --> 00:29:00,523
Wherever she finds herself,
she must stay on the surface,

332
00:29:00,609 --> 00:29:02,565
and more or less crawl.

333
00:29:02,649 --> 00:29:04,002
I shall never crawl.

334
00:29:04,089 --> 00:29:07,126
Yes. 0n the whole,
I don't see you crawling.

335
00:29:08,769 --> 00:29:11,841
But the men, the Americans?

336
00:29:11,929 --> 00:29:13,920
Look at poor Ralph Touchett.

337
00:29:14,009 --> 00:29:16,523
What sort of figure do you call that?

338
00:29:16,609 --> 00:29:19,601
Fortunately, he has consumption.

339
00:29:19,689 --> 00:29:23,364
I say fortunately because
it gives him something to do.

340
00:29:23,449 --> 00:29:26,202
His consumption's his...carriere.

341
00:29:26,289 --> 00:29:28,484
It's a kind of position.

342
00:29:28,569 --> 00:29:31,083
If he were not ill,
he'd do something.

343
00:29:31,169 --> 00:29:33,922
He'd take his father's
place in the bank.

344
00:29:34,009 --> 00:29:36,569
I doubt it.
He's not at all fond of the bank.

345
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:40,965
- Are you not good friends?
- Perfectly!

346
00:29:41,049 --> 00:29:43,005
But he doesn't like me.

347
00:29:43,569 --> 00:29:45,207
What have you done to him?

348
00:29:45,289 --> 00:29:46,847
Nothing whatever,

349
00:29:46,929 --> 00:29:49,489
but one has no need
of a reason for that.

350
00:29:49,569 --> 00:29:53,721
For not liking you? I think one
has need of a very good reason.

351
00:29:54,249 --> 00:29:56,444
(Merle ) Ah. I love the English rain.

352
00:29:56,529 --> 00:30:00,408
There's always a little of it
and never too much at once.

353
00:30:00,489 --> 00:30:03,162
And it always...smells good.

354
00:30:04,169 --> 00:30:06,205
(sniffs ) Ah, delicious!

355
00:30:07,289 --> 00:30:09,849
Mmm, delicious!

356
00:30:11,409 --> 00:30:13,365
Mmm, it is!

357
00:30:29,009 --> 00:30:31,682
I'd give a good deal
to be your age again,

358
00:30:31,769 --> 00:30:34,283
to have my life before me.

359
00:30:34,889 --> 00:30:37,039
Your life's before you yet.

360
00:30:37,929 --> 00:30:41,558
No. The best part's gone,
and gone for nothing.

361
00:30:41,649 --> 00:30:43,446
0h, surely not for nothing.

362
00:30:43,529 --> 00:30:46,487
Why not? What have I got?

363
00:30:46,569 --> 00:30:51,689
Neither husband
nor child nor fortune.

364
00:30:52,929 --> 00:30:54,885
Nor even a house of my own.

365
00:30:55,449 --> 00:30:58,964
What should you like to
do that you've not done?

366
00:31:04,049 --> 00:31:06,244
I'm very ambitious.

367
00:31:06,329 --> 00:31:10,242
To me,
you're the vivid image of success.

368
00:31:13,689 --> 00:31:18,683
My dreams were so...great.

369
00:31:22,929 --> 00:31:27,559
I should make myself ridiculous
by talking of them.

370
00:31:29,929 --> 00:31:32,284
I should like you to have this.

371
00:31:32,369 --> 00:31:34,963
I am going to six places
in succession,

372
00:31:35,049 --> 00:31:38,359
and I shall meet no one
I like so well as you.

373
00:31:55,129 --> 00:31:56,482
Ahem.

374
00:32:51,729 --> 00:32:56,405
He has left me this house, but
naturally, I shall not live in it.

375
00:32:57,209 --> 00:33:01,088
I have a much better one
in Florence, as you know.

376
00:33:01,169 --> 00:33:04,366
And Ralph gets Gardencourt.

377
00:33:04,449 --> 00:33:09,728
serena, there is one remarkable
clause in my husband's will.

378
00:33:09,809 --> 00:33:11,800
I'll ring for tea?

379
00:33:12,889 --> 00:33:15,687
He has left my niece a fortune.

380
00:33:17,009 --> 00:33:19,682
- A fortune?
- Mm-hmm.

381
00:33:19,769 --> 00:33:24,559
Isabel steps into
something like L70,000.

382
00:33:29,609 --> 00:33:31,565
The clever creature.

383
00:33:56,649 --> 00:33:59,004
(Man ) she seems to me very genteel.

384
00:34:09,769 --> 00:34:12,329
she's really pretty.

385
00:34:12,409 --> 00:34:16,846
When her mother died, I sent her
to see what you'd make of her.

386
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:18,806
I had faith, you know.

387
00:34:18,889 --> 00:34:22,723
she's perfect. she has no faults.

388
00:34:22,809 --> 00:34:25,448
We've had her
since she was so small.

389
00:34:25,529 --> 00:34:28,885
- It's not certain you'll lose her.
- Monsieur,

390
00:34:28,969 --> 00:34:31,688
good as she is,
she's not one of us.

391
00:34:31,769 --> 00:34:35,284
she's made for the world.

392
00:34:36,009 --> 00:34:38,045
Nothing's settled yet.

393
00:34:46,969 --> 00:34:49,244
- Buon giorno.
- Buon giorno.

394
00:34:49,329 --> 00:34:51,320
(speaking Italian )

395
00:34:59,049 --> 00:35:02,121
It's only the colour
that's different, Mama.

396
00:35:02,209 --> 00:35:05,519
There are just as many
in one bunch as in the other.

397
00:35:05,609 --> 00:35:06,962
Grazie.

398
00:35:09,609 --> 00:35:11,600
Is there someone here?

399
00:35:11,689 --> 00:35:14,965
Yes, there is. someone you may see.

400
00:35:15,049 --> 00:35:18,519
- Madame Merle.
- I've come to welcome you home.

401
00:35:19,729 --> 00:35:21,526
May I not go to the carriage?

402
00:35:21,609 --> 00:35:24,965
It would please me better
if you'd remain with me.

403
00:35:32,169 --> 00:35:34,967
I do hope they see
that you wear gloves.

404
00:35:36,089 --> 00:35:38,444
Little girls usually dislike them.

405
00:35:38,529 --> 00:35:41,407
I used to dislike them,
but I like them now.

406
00:35:41,489 --> 00:35:44,481
I'll make you a present of a dozen.

407
00:35:44,569 --> 00:35:48,881
- And will they be very pretty?
- Not too pretty.

408
00:35:53,089 --> 00:35:55,444
she's going to give me some gloves.

409
00:35:56,809 --> 00:36:00,882
You're very kind to her.
But she has everything she needs.

410
00:36:00,969 --> 00:36:03,324
I'd think
she's had enough of the nuns.

411
00:36:03,409 --> 00:36:05,923
If we're discussing it,
she should leave.

412
00:36:06,009 --> 00:36:08,842
Let her stay.
We'll talk of something else.

413
00:36:12,209 --> 00:36:16,407
Go into the garden, mignonne,
and pluck a flower for our friend?

414
00:36:16,489 --> 00:36:18,639
That's just what I want to do.

415
00:36:25,929 --> 00:36:27,806
(Door closes )

416
00:36:32,889 --> 00:36:36,518
There's something I should
like you to do in Florence.

417
00:36:42,329 --> 00:36:45,162
There's a friend of mine
I want you to know.

418
00:36:46,449 --> 00:36:48,326
What good will that do me?

419
00:36:51,729 --> 00:36:53,208
It will amuse you.

420
00:36:53,289 --> 00:36:55,245
(Laughs sarcastically )

421
00:36:56,849 --> 00:37:00,000
0h, if only I could induce you
to make an effort.

422
00:37:00,089 --> 00:37:03,081
Ah, I knew
something tiresome was coming.

423
00:37:03,169 --> 00:37:08,163
What in the world that's likely to
show up here is worth an effort?

424
00:37:13,209 --> 00:37:15,086
Don't be foolish, 0smond.

425
00:37:16,929 --> 00:37:19,887
The person I came to Florence to see.

426
00:37:21,369 --> 00:37:24,042
she's a niece of Mrs Touchett.

427
00:37:25,089 --> 00:37:30,368
she's young, 23 years old.
I met her in England six months ago.

428
00:37:31,409 --> 00:37:33,365
I like her immensely.

429
00:37:34,969 --> 00:37:39,326
And I do what I don't
do every day, I...

430
00:37:40,569 --> 00:37:42,639
admire her.

431
00:37:43,169 --> 00:37:45,160
You'll do the same.

432
00:37:46,449 --> 00:37:48,405
Not if I can help it.

433
00:37:48,489 --> 00:37:51,242
You won't be able to help it.

434
00:37:51,329 --> 00:37:54,480
Is she beautiful,
clever, rich, splendid,

435
00:37:54,569 --> 00:37:58,687
universally intelligent,
unprecedentedly virtuous?

436
00:37:58,769 --> 00:38:02,808
It's only on those conditions
that I care to make her acquaintance.

437
00:38:02,889 --> 00:38:06,564
I know plenty of dingy people.
I don't want to know any more.

438
00:38:06,729 --> 00:38:08,685
Miss Archer isn't dingy.

439
00:38:10,809 --> 00:38:13,004
she fills all your requirements.

440
00:38:13,089 --> 00:38:14,681
More or less, of course.

441
00:38:14,769 --> 00:38:18,603
No. Quite literally.

442
00:38:32,609 --> 00:38:34,964
What do you want to do with her?

443
00:38:38,449 --> 00:38:43,364
What you see. Put her in your way.

444
00:38:45,849 --> 00:38:48,886
Isn't she meant
for something better than that?

445
00:38:48,969 --> 00:38:51,847
I don't pretend to know
what people are meant for.

446
00:38:51,929 --> 00:38:54,204
I only know what I can do with them.

447
00:38:54,289 --> 00:38:56,849
I'm sorry for Miss Archer.

448
00:38:57,929 --> 00:39:02,525
If that's the beginning of interest
in her, I take note of it.

449
00:39:02,609 --> 00:39:04,565
You're looking very well.

450
00:39:05,969 --> 00:39:09,757
You never look so well
as when you've got an idea.

451
00:39:10,969 --> 00:39:13,324
They're always becoming to you.

452
00:39:18,449 --> 00:39:22,237
I wish very much
you were not so heartless.

453
00:39:22,329 --> 00:39:26,561
It's always been against you,
and it will be against you now.

454
00:39:26,649 --> 00:39:29,447
I'm not so heartless as you think.

455
00:39:30,649 --> 00:39:35,245
Every now and then
something...touches me.

456
00:39:35,329 --> 00:39:38,002
As for instance,
your ambitions for me.

457
00:39:38,089 --> 00:39:42,560
Why would you think Mrs Touchett's
niece should matter to me when...

458
00:39:42,649 --> 00:39:44,719
..I myself have mattered so little?

459
00:39:44,809 --> 00:39:48,085
That is not what I
meant to say, of course.

460
00:39:49,169 --> 00:39:54,402
When I have known and appreciated
such a woman as you.

461
00:39:54,489 --> 00:39:56,923
Isabel Archer is better than I.

462
00:40:24,449 --> 00:40:26,405
Have you seen my latest?

463
00:40:26,489 --> 00:40:29,845
Isn't that one
of last year's sketches?

464
00:40:29,929 --> 00:40:31,726
The one you did in spain?

465
00:40:31,809 --> 00:40:33,959
I've made improvements since then.

466
00:40:34,049 --> 00:40:36,165
I don't care for your drawings.

467
00:40:36,249 --> 00:40:38,604
They're much better
than other peoples'.

468
00:40:38,689 --> 00:40:42,921
But as the only thing you do,
it's so little.

469
00:40:44,009 --> 00:40:48,207
I should have liked you to do so many
other things. I had my ambitions.

470
00:40:48,289 --> 00:40:51,998
- Things that were impossible.
- Things that were impossible.

471
00:40:58,929 --> 00:41:01,648
Your room, at least, is perfect.

472
00:41:01,729 --> 00:41:04,607
I'm struck with that afresh
whenever I come back here.

473
00:41:05,689 --> 00:41:07,645
You've such adorable taste.

474
00:41:10,769 --> 00:41:12,839
I'm sick of my adorable taste.

475
00:41:13,849 --> 00:41:16,602
You must let Miss Archer
come and see it.

476
00:41:18,929 --> 00:41:24,049
As cicerone of your museum,
you appear to particular advantage.

477
00:41:26,409 --> 00:41:28,365
Did you say she was rich?

478
00:41:31,129 --> 00:41:34,360
There's no doubt whatever
about her fortune.

479
00:41:39,602 --> 00:41:42,594
(speaking Italian )

480
00:41:42,682 --> 00:41:44,638
(Bell chimes )

481
00:41:59,602 --> 00:42:02,560
Do you think it good for me
to be made so rich?

482
00:42:02,642 --> 00:42:04,598
Henrietta doesn't.

483
00:42:05,442 --> 00:42:09,276
0h, hang Henrietta.
If you ask me, I'm delighted at it.

484
00:42:09,362 --> 00:42:12,991
Did you know your father intended
to leave me so much money?

485
00:42:13,082 --> 00:42:16,472
What does it matter?
My father was very obstinate.

486
00:42:16,562 --> 00:42:18,837
so you did know?

487
00:42:19,442 --> 00:42:20,875
Yes, he told me.

488
00:42:21,682 --> 00:42:24,958
How did he know I'll make good uses
of a large fortune?

489
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:26,953
How did he know I'm not weak?

490
00:42:27,042 --> 00:42:31,001
Don't ask yourself so much whether
this or that is good for you.

491
00:42:31,082 --> 00:42:35,439
Live as you like best, and your
character will take care of itself.

492
00:42:35,522 --> 00:42:38,639
I wonder if you know what you say.

493
00:42:38,722 --> 00:42:42,271
If you do,
you take a great responsibility.

494
00:42:44,882 --> 00:42:46,281
(Giggles )

495
00:42:46,642 --> 00:42:48,598
(Bell chimes )

496
00:43:05,282 --> 00:43:09,241
The facade is 16th century,
but the interior is much older.

497
00:43:09,322 --> 00:43:11,472
(Woman speaking Italian )

498
00:43:14,882 --> 00:43:18,033
I must tell you that 0smond
doesn't often invite me.

499
00:43:18,122 --> 00:43:20,955
It was quite my own idea,
coming today.

500
00:43:21,042 --> 00:43:24,921
I like to see new people,
and I'm sure you're very new.

501
00:43:25,002 --> 00:43:27,072
0h! But don't sit there.

502
00:43:27,162 --> 00:43:29,995
That chair's not what it looks.

503
00:43:30,082 --> 00:43:36,078
There are very good seats here, but
there are also some horrors. Pipi.

504
00:43:36,162 --> 00:43:37,720
(Isabel) I don't see any.

505
00:43:37,802 --> 00:43:40,521
Everything seems to me
beautiful and precious.

506
00:43:40,602 --> 00:43:44,117
Thank you.
I've a few good things.

507
00:43:45,242 --> 00:43:47,631
Indeed, I've nothing very bad.

508
00:43:47,722 --> 00:43:51,112
Poor 0smond with his old curtains
and crucifixes.

509
00:43:51,202 --> 00:43:55,195
Won't you have some tea?
You must be very tired.

510
00:43:55,282 --> 00:43:58,319
No, I'm not tired.
What have I done to tire me?

511
00:43:59,082 --> 00:44:01,038
You'll be tired when you go home

512
00:44:01,122 --> 00:44:04,512
if he shows you all his bibelots

513
00:44:04,602 --> 00:44:06,638
and gives you a lecture on each.

514
00:44:06,722 --> 00:44:08,792
Then I'll have learned something.

515
00:44:08,882 --> 00:44:12,158
0h, well, for me,
one should like a thing or not,

516
00:44:12,242 --> 00:44:14,756
but one shouldn't try
to reason it out.

517
00:44:14,842 --> 00:44:16,514
some very good feelings

518
00:44:16,602 --> 00:44:19,241
may have very bad reasons,
don't you know?

519
00:44:19,322 --> 00:44:22,075
It's a lovely day.
shall we go for a walk?

520
00:44:22,162 --> 00:44:27,998
0h! And then there are some very bad
feelings that have very good reasons.

521
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:31,631
This hill of my brother's
is impossible.

522
00:44:31,722 --> 00:44:34,316
It's terrible
to hear one's horses wheeze.

523
00:44:34,402 --> 00:44:37,121
What do you think of my sister?

524
00:44:42,282 --> 00:44:44,750
Don't ask me that, I- I...

525
00:44:44,842 --> 00:44:47,037
I've seen your sister too little.

526
00:44:47,122 --> 00:44:50,080
Yes, it's true,
you've seen her very little,

527
00:44:50,162 --> 00:44:54,952
but I should like to know how she
strikes a fresh, unprejudiced mind.

528
00:44:57,442 --> 00:45:01,674
I sometimes think
we've gotten into a rather bad way,

529
00:45:01,762 --> 00:45:06,472
living here amongst people and things
not our own.

530
00:45:07,562 --> 00:45:13,319
My sister's rather unhappy,
and as she's not of a serious turn,

531
00:45:13,402 --> 00:45:17,714
she doesn't tend to show it
tragically, but comically instead.

532
00:45:20,402 --> 00:45:24,953
shall I take that painting down?
You'll want more light.

533
00:45:36,162 --> 00:45:40,519
This is one of the first paintings
I bought when I came to Italy.

534
00:45:41,442 --> 00:45:44,320
I've seen the girl but this once,
I like her very much.

535
00:45:44,402 --> 00:45:46,074
so do I.

536
00:45:46,162 --> 00:45:48,676
You have a strange way of showing it.

537
00:45:48,762 --> 00:45:50,115
Do not agitate yourself.

538
00:45:50,202 --> 00:45:53,751
The matter concerns three persons
stronger in purpose than yourself.

539
00:45:53,842 --> 00:45:58,199
Three persons?
You and 0smond, of course.

540
00:45:58,282 --> 00:46:00,921
But is Miss Archer also very strong?

541
00:46:01,002 --> 00:46:03,675
Quite as much so as we.

542
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:07,117
You're capable of anything,
you and 0smond.

543
00:46:07,202 --> 00:46:09,193
- You're dangerous.
- Better leave us alone, then.

544
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:17,230
Madame Merle spoke of you having
some plan of going around the world?

545
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:21,392
I'm rather ashamed of my plans.

546
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:23,789
I make a new one every day.

547
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:28,112
I don't think you should be ashamed.
It's the greatest of pleasures.

548
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:31,795
I made a plan years ago
and I'm acting on it today.

549
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:35,475
Must have been a very pleasant one.

550
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:38,836
Mmm, it was. Very simple.

551
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:42,356
It was to be as quiet as possible.

552
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:45,672
As quiet?

553
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:50,752
Not to worry,
not to strive nor struggle.

554
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:53,832
To content myself with little.

555
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:59,069
I've spent many years here
on that plan,

556
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:02,197
and been not at all unhappy.

557
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:09,994
It polishes me up a bit
to talk to you.

558
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:16,912
But you'll be gone
before I see you three times.

559
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,913
That's what it is to live
in a country that people come to.

560
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:26,079
Have you had the opportunity
to wander in Florence at all?

561
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:28,594
(speaking Italian )

562
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:33,351
serena, you know everything.

563
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:36,955
Is that curious creature
making love to my niece?

564
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:41,396
Gilbert 0smond?

565
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:44,950
Heaven help us, that's an idea.

566
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:48,120
It hadn't occurred to you? Hmm?

567
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:51,909
He's called five times
in the course of a fortnight.

568
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:57,308
You make me feel an idiot,
but I confess it hadn't.

569
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:59,914
I wonder if it
has occurred to Isabel?

570
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,752
I shall ask her.

571
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:05,594
Don't put it in her head.
The thing would be to ask Mr 0smond.

572
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:09,309
I cannot. I'll not have him
inquire of me with that air of his.

573
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:11,630
I'll ask him myself.

574
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:16,190
I'll investigate and report to you.

575
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:19,272
she'd marry him
for the beauty of his opinions

576
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:22,079
or his autograph of Michelangelo.

577
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:26,196
(Man speaking Italian )

578
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:42,312
Excuse me.

579
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:53,469
Which day is that?

580
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:56,673
she wants me to go to Caparola
with her.

581
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:58,830
(speaking Italian )

582
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:05,756
To go with her?

583
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:08,276
To be there while she's there.

584
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:11,511
she proposed it.
0f course, I gave her the chance.

585
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:16,151
I rejoice to hear it,
but don't cry victory too soon.

586
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:17,639
0f course you'll go.

587
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:22,549
It makes me work, this idea of yours.

588
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:25,035
Don't pretend you don't enjoy it.

589
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:31,276
You've made a very good impression.
And I can see you've received one.

590
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:35,035
You've not come to Mrs Touchett's
so often to oblige me.

591
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:38,954
The girl's not disagreeable.
she has only one fault.

592
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:41,793
- What's that?
- Too many ideas.

593
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:44,678
I warned you she was clever.

594
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:47,194
Fortunately, they're very bad ones.

595
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:51,273
Why is that fortunate? - No loss if
they must be sacrificed.

596
00:49:57,600 --> 00:49:59,113
You're unfathomable.

597
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:02,749
I'm frightened at the abyss
into which I've cast her.

598
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:06,150
You can't draw back now.
You're in too far.

599
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:08,679
Very good.

600
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:11,115
But you must
do the rest yourself.

601
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:15,470
(Henrietta ) It's incredible.
There's so much work,

602
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:18,711
and they would have been
paid a pittance for it.

603
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:21,836
I forgot my parasol. I must go back.

604
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:23,911
- I'll get it.
- No, it's fine.

605
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,276
- Do you want some caffé?
- Yes, thank you.

606
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:07,958
0h!

607
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:12,670
so you decided to come?

608
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:15,479
Mm-hmm. I came last night.

609
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:17,437
Hmm.

610
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:19,670
The others are up above.

611
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:24,152
I didn't come here for the others.

612
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:26,151
I came to say goodbye.

613
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:30,358
Who knows if you'll come back?
You're under no obligation to.

614
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:33,432
- You think my travels ridiculous?
- No.

615
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:36,512
Go everywhere, do everything.

616
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:40,195
Be happy, be triumphant.

617
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:48,673
- What do you mean by triumphant?
- Well, doing what you like.

618
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:53,917
Doing all the vain things one likes
may be tiresome.

619
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,959
Exactly. And you'll be tired someday.

620
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:02,990
I don't know whether
I'd better not wait until then

621
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:05,753
for something I want
to say to you.

622
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:09,798
I can't advise you
without knowing what it is.

623
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:11,677
But I'm horrid when I'm tired.

624
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:13,478
I don't believe that.

625
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:16,438
You're angry sometimes,
that I can believe,

626
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:18,715
but I'm sure
you're never horrid.

627
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:22,356
Not even when I lose my temper?

628
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:26,399
You don't lose your temper, you
find it. And that must be beautiful.

629
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:33,750
If only I could find it now.

630
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:39,318
I'm not afraid.

631
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:45,996
I should fold my arms
and admire you.

632
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:53,275
What I wish to say is that
I find I'm in love with you.

633
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:56,796
0h... No, that had better wait.

634
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:59,519
No. You may heed it now or never,
as you please.

635
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:01,556
But after all, I must say it.

636
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:05,437
I'm absolutely in love with you.

637
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:08,918
Don't say that, please.

638
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,479
It will not matter to you.

639
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:14,075
I have neither fame nor fortune,
so I offer nothing.

640
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:18,277
I think I'm glad
that we're separating.

641
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:21,432
If you weren't going away,
you'd know me better.

642
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:23,670
I shall do that some other time.

643
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:30,869
There's one thing more, a little
service I should like to ask.

644
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:33,758
I'm going to Rome for a few days.

645
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:36,718
Would you visit my daughter
before you leave Florence?

646
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:43,511
Yes, of course.

647
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:51,638
0h...

648
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:34,836
(Henrietta ) Hello? Hello?

649
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:36,911
Isabel, are you down there?

650
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:41,710
We've got your coffee waiting!

651
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:45,999
Hello? Can you see her down there?

652
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:49,231
- (Ralph ) It's dark.
- Hello?

653
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:52,112
0h, hello.

654
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:03,549
I think they're the
most beautiful gardens in the world.

655
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:08,832
Not that I've been
everywhere in the world.

656
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:15,799
Papa says while he's away,
I'm not to go beyond this line.

657
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:19,996
Your father says that?

658
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:22,389
He thinks I will get scorched.

659
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:26,589
Hmm.

660
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:31,349
Here...share my parasol.

661
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:41,917
What is it?

662
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:52,038
No, you're right to do
as your father says.

663
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:56,875
He'll never ask you
anything unreasonable.

664
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:02,352
Want tea?

665
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:46,717
(Isabel) There it is!

666
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:55,116
(serena ) 'Nine, ten. Excuse me.'
(Isabel) 'No, no, no.'

667
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:04,630
(0smond) 'What I wish to say is that

668
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:07,792
'I'm absolutely in love with you.'

669
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:11,555
(Women's voices ) 'I'm absolutely in
love with you... in love with you.'

670
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:17,590
(0smond)
'I'm absolutely in love with you.'

671
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:22,433
(Isabel)
'Absolutely in love with you.

672
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:25,592
'I'm absolutely in love with you.'

(0smond)
'I'm absolutely in love with you.

674
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:33,399
'Absolutely in love with you.'

675
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:36,119
(Isabel)
'I'm absolutely in love with you.'

676
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:39,158
(0smond)
'I'm absolutely in love with you.'

677
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:42,471
(0smond and Isabel)
'I'm absolutely in love with you.'

678
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:44,198
(Isabel) 0h, oh, oh...

679
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:54,510
(Workers speaking Italian )

680
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:21,598
(speaking Italian )

681
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:44,117
I can't tell you how I hoped
you wouldn't come.

682
00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:51,917
I've no doubt of that.

683
00:58:56,080 --> 00:58:58,833
I gave you forewarning
I'd do as I choose.

684
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:03,198
I wanted to hear your explanation
of you having changed your mind.

685
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:04,633
An explanation?

686
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:08,190
- Do you think I'm bound to explain?
- You were very positive.

687
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:09,952
I did believe it.

688
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,638
I've not deceived you.

689
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:17,756
I was perfectly free.

690
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:23,159
When I had your letter, I thought
there might be some mistake.

691
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:27,031
There's no mistake whatever.

692
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:35,552
Well... I've done what I wished.

693
00:59:38,320 --> 00:59:40,072
I've seen you.

694
00:59:58,600 --> 01:00:01,637
Do you mean you came
simply to look at me?

695
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:09,472
(Door closes )

696
01:00:23,560 --> 01:00:24,959
(Coughing from inside )

697
01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:35,596
(Coughing)

698
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:43,877
You didn't come up for lunch.

699
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:50,029
(Coughing) I'm not hungry.

700
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:55,955
You ought to eat. You live on air.

701
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:03,116
I haven't congratulated you.

702
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:10,638
I wondered why you were silent.

703
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:14,110
I hardly got over my surprise
since my mother told me.

704
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:17,431
You're the last person
I expected to see caught.

705
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:22,793
I don't see why you call it "caught".

706
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:24,836
(Coughs )

707
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:31,113
Because you're going to be
put into a cage.

708
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:34,510
If I like my cage,
that needn't trouble you.

709
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:42,235
I'd treated myself... (Coughs )

710
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:44,675
to a charming vision of your future.

711
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:51,718
I'd amused myself with planning out
high destiny for you.

712
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:55,873
There was to be nothing
of this sort in it.

713
01:01:55,960 --> 01:01:58,952
You were not to come down
so easily or so soon.

714
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:00,996
"Come down"?

715
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:03,838
It hurts me.

716
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:08,511
Hurts me as if I'd fallen myself.

717
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:14,238
I don't understand you.

718
01:02:14,320 --> 01:02:16,675
I should have said...

719
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:20,355
the man for you
would have had a more...

720
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:21,919
active, larger...

721
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,560
freer sort of nature.

722
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:29,753
I can't get over the sense
that 0smond is...is somehow...

723
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:32,354
(Clears throat) ..well, small.

724
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:36,796
"small."

725
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:39,713
I think he's narrow...selfish.

726
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:42,109
He takes himself so seriously.

727
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:45,636
(Coughs )
He's the incarnation of taste.

728
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:47,517
His taste is exquisite.

729
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:51,718
You ever seen such a taste,
a really exquisite one, ruffled?

730
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:56,396
I hope I will never fail
to gratify my husband's.

731
01:02:56,480 --> 01:02:58,436
0h.

732
01:02:58,520 --> 01:03:01,592
That's...that's capital, that's...

733
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:03,238
wonderful!

734
01:03:03,320 --> 01:03:05,914
That's what every wife
would wish for.

735
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,912
But weren't you meant
for something better

736
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:12,754
than to guard the sensibilities
of a sterile dilettante?

737
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:18,835
I've said what I've had on my mind.

738
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:24,913
said it because I love you.

739
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,230
Then you're not disinterested.

740
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:35,075
I love you, but without hope.

741
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:45,796
I see Mr 0smond in quite another way.

742
01:03:45,880 --> 01:03:48,519
He's not important, no.
He's not rich.

743
01:03:49,640 --> 01:03:53,519
He has no titles
nor honours nor property.

744
01:03:55,080 --> 01:03:59,073
If that's what you mean by small,
he's as small as you please.

745
01:03:59,160 --> 01:04:01,355
I call that large.

746
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:04,710
It's the largest thing I know.

747
01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:09,948
He...he has the gentlest,

748
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:14,158
kindest, lightest spirit.

749
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:19,679
You've got hold of a false idea.

750
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:24,315
It's a pity, but I can't help it.

751
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:30,550
(Coughing)

752
01:04:46,520 --> 01:04:49,751
(0smond) They think I'm
in love with your money.

753
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:51,796
(Isabel) How do you know?

754
01:04:51,880 --> 01:04:54,110
You've not told me they're pleased,

755
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:56,998
and if they had been,
I should have had some sign of it.

756
01:04:58,600 --> 01:05:00,830
(0smond) I care for only one thing,

757
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:03,593
for you not having
the shadow of a doubt.

758
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:05,875
You know I have not, not one shadow.

759
01:05:05,960 --> 01:05:08,872
I have never in my life
tried to earn a penny.

760
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:11,428
I ought to be less
subject to suspicion

761
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:13,909
than most people one sees grubbing.

762
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:18,471
I won't pretend I'm sorry
you're rich, I'm delighted.

763
01:05:18,560 --> 01:05:22,314
At moments I'd like to kneel
by my uncle's grave and thank him.

764
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:25,829
It has made me better, loving you.

765
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:28,832
I'm not a failure,
as I used to think.

766
01:05:28,920 --> 01:05:30,876
I've succeeded in two things.

767
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:32,871
I am to marry the woman I adore,

768
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:36,032
and I've brought up
my child in the old way.

769
01:05:36,120 --> 01:05:40,636
(0smond) We'll amuse ourselves
making up some little life for her.

770
01:06:15,040 --> 01:06:17,838
(Man ) That's why
I wanted your advice...

771
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:20,798
as an old friend
of Miss 0smond's family.

772
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:25,351
What have you got besides your
spanish lace and Dresden teacups?

773
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:30,195
My collection's well thought of and
I've a comfortable little fortune,

774
01:06:30,280 --> 01:06:33,397
about 40,000 francs a year.

775
01:06:33,480 --> 01:06:36,631
Miss 0smond and I
can live beautifully on that.

776
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:41,432
Beautifully? No. sufficiently, yes.

777
01:06:42,520 --> 01:06:44,636
Her father can give you nothing.

778
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:48,434
He, uh, he lives like a rich man.

779
01:06:48,520 --> 01:06:50,078
The money's his wife's.

780
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:52,390
she brought him a large fortune.

781
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:56,314
Mrs 0smond is fond of her
stepdaughter, she may do something.

782
01:06:57,400 --> 01:07:00,631
For a lovesick man,
you have your wits about you.

783
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:07,871
No, she will probably prefer to keep
her money for her own children.

784
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:11,589
Her own children?
surely she has none.

785
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:13,955
she may have yet.

786
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:17,749
she had a poor little boy
who died almost two years ago.

787
01:07:18,760 --> 01:07:21,069
I'm...very sorry.

788
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:25,197
Uh, she's a splendid woman.

789
01:07:31,320 --> 01:07:34,118
I don't say your offer's
to be jumped at,

790
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:36,350
but there might be a worse one.

791
01:07:38,080 --> 01:07:41,470
Mr 0smond, however,
will believe he can do better.

792
01:07:44,320 --> 01:07:46,038
He can do better, perhaps,

793
01:07:46,120 --> 01:07:50,591
but his daughter can do no better
than marry the man she loves.

794
01:07:50,680 --> 01:07:52,352
Well, she does, you know.

795
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:56,399
And, in the meanwhile,
I'll say a word to Mrs 0smond.

796
01:07:56,480 --> 01:07:59,995
No. No, don't set her going,
or you'll spoil everything.

797
01:08:00,080 --> 01:08:03,072
Her husband's
sure to have other views.

798
01:08:03,160 --> 01:08:08,393
I advise you not to multiply the
points of difference between them.

799
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:12,830
Let the matter alone until
I've taken a few soundings.

800
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:15,593
Let the matter alone?

801
01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:17,238
But I'm in love!

802
01:08:19,160 --> 01:08:21,116
0h, you won't burn up.

803
01:08:45,880 --> 01:08:47,836
(Chattering)

804
01:09:04,360 --> 01:09:06,112
(speaking Italian )

805
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:14,035
(speaking Italian )

806
01:09:25,760 --> 01:09:27,478
(speaking Italian )

807
01:09:38,440 --> 01:09:39,839
Where is Pansy?

808
01:09:40,840 --> 01:09:42,796
she has already come down.

809
01:10:17,680 --> 01:10:19,477
(speaking Italian )

810
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:33,396
(0smond) I hate his proposal.

811
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:38,191
I let him see that.
I was rude to him on purpose.

812
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:41,111
I'll tell him you'll think it over.

813
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:44,158
No! Don't do that, he'll hang on.

814
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:46,470
I hate talking with a donkey...

815
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:48,551
(Imitates donkey )

816
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:52,436
He's a gentleman.

817
01:10:53,080 --> 01:10:55,116
He has a charming temper...

818
01:10:56,200 --> 01:10:58,714
and, after all, a comfortable income.

819
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:01,234
It's misery, genteel misery.

820
01:11:01,320 --> 01:11:03,675
It's not what I dreamed of for Pansy.

821
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:06,957
Fortunately, this doesn't
find me unprepared.

822
01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:09,190
It's what I educated her for.

823
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:12,829
It's all for this, that
when a case like this should come up,

824
01:11:12,920 --> 01:11:15,275
she should do what I prefer.

825
01:11:25,120 --> 01:11:29,079
I've never been treated so.
I don't know what's against me.

826
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:32,914
It's not how I'm considered.
I could have married 20 times.

827
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,195
You're not rich enough for Pansy.

828
01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:39,068
- she doesn't care about money.
- No. But her father does.

829
01:11:39,160 --> 01:11:42,311
0h, yes. Well, you would know that.

830
01:11:55,120 --> 01:11:56,872
You're offended.

831
01:11:57,880 --> 01:12:00,314
And now you'll never help me.

832
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:01,958
It's not that I won't...

833
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:05,510
I simply can't.

834
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:13,597
(0smond) Isabel,
I bring you an old friend.

835
01:12:13,680 --> 01:12:15,557
Lord Warburton.

836
01:12:15,640 --> 01:12:18,359
I've only just arrived
this afternoon.

837
01:12:18,440 --> 01:12:22,433
I knew you were at home
on Thursdays, so...I came.

838
01:12:22,520 --> 01:12:26,479
You see, the fame of your Thursdays
has spread to England. Excuse me.

839
01:12:30,280 --> 01:12:31,998
We're greatly flattered.

840
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:34,230
I'm really very glad to see you.

841
01:12:34,440 --> 01:12:38,319
There's something I must tell you
without further delay.

842
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:41,153
I've brought
Ralph Touchett with me.

843
01:12:41,240 --> 01:12:43,629
No, no, he's not here.
He's at the hotel.

844
01:12:43,720 --> 01:12:45,472
He was too tired to come.

845
01:12:45,560 --> 01:12:47,790
Why has he come to Rome?

846
01:12:47,880 --> 01:12:50,633
He's very far gone, Mrs 0smond.

847
01:12:50,720 --> 01:12:55,316
He can't keep warm. And the further
south we come, the colder he feels.

848
01:12:55,400 --> 01:12:57,197
If you don't mind my saying,

849
01:12:57,280 --> 01:13:02,070
it was the most extraordinary time
for Mrs Touchett to go to America.

850
01:13:05,360 --> 01:13:08,511
Do you know what your father
said to me just now?

851
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:12,275
Don't speak so loud.
Everyone will hear.

852
01:13:12,360 --> 01:13:14,396
He says you've forgotten me.

853
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:17,916
No... I don't forget.

854
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:22,397
Everything's just the same?

855
01:13:24,840 --> 01:13:28,753
Not the very same.
Papa's been terribly severe.

856
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:30,558
He forbids me to marry you.

857
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:32,437
Need you mind that?

858
01:13:33,720 --> 01:13:36,154
I can't disobey Papa.

859
01:13:36,240 --> 01:13:38,196
You sacrifice me like that?

860
01:13:42,640 --> 01:13:44,949
I love you just as much.

861
01:13:45,040 --> 01:13:46,871
What good will that do me?

862
01:13:48,360 --> 01:13:52,911
Please don't talk any more.
Papa said I was not to talk to you.

863
01:13:54,200 --> 01:13:55,952
It's too much.

864
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:06,116
- May I introduce you to some people?
- 0h, no, please don't.

865
01:14:06,200 --> 01:14:08,953
Unless it be to that young lady
at the tea table.

866
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:10,951
she has a charming face.

867
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:13,076
That's my husband's daughter.

868
01:14:13,160 --> 01:14:14,718
What a dear little maid.

869
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:18,713
- You must meet her.
- 0h, in a...in a moment.

870
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:21,876
I like looking at her from here.

871
01:14:26,920 --> 01:14:30,435
You know...you've changed a bit.

872
01:14:31,440 --> 01:14:32,793
Yes, a good deal.

873
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:35,394
I don't mean for the worse,
of course.

874
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:38,756
And yet how can I say for the better?

875
01:14:42,390 --> 01:14:45,109
(Clears throat) 0h.

876
01:15:03,070 --> 01:15:06,142
I think, after all,
that I shan't go to sicily.

877
01:15:06,230 --> 01:15:07,902
Won't go to sicily?

878
01:15:07,990 --> 01:15:09,901
(Isabel) Where will you go?

879
01:15:13,230 --> 01:15:15,027
I guess I won't go anywhere.

880
01:15:15,110 --> 01:15:16,668
You'll return to England?

881
01:15:17,750 --> 01:15:19,388
0h, dear, no.

882
01:15:19,470 --> 01:15:22,667
- I'll stay in Rome.
- (Warburton ) Rome won't do.

883
01:15:22,750 --> 01:15:25,947
- (Isabel) Rome's too cold.
- It will have to do.

884
01:15:28,710 --> 01:15:30,302
(Warburton ) Try sicily.

885
01:15:30,390 --> 01:15:32,620
I can't try.
I can't move further.

886
01:15:32,710 --> 01:15:36,498
I can't face the journey.
And I haven't a cousin in sicily.

887
01:15:38,110 --> 01:15:40,066
What does the doctor say?

888
01:15:42,710 --> 01:15:46,066
(sighs ) I haven't asked him,
and I don't care a fig.

889
01:15:46,150 --> 01:15:48,425
If I die here, you'll bury me.

890
01:15:49,470 --> 01:15:51,461
You shan't die here.

891
01:16:02,430 --> 01:16:05,103
(Ralph ) I can't believe
she's so cold.

892
01:16:05,190 --> 01:16:08,660
she's utterly changed. It's 0smond.

893
01:16:18,830 --> 01:16:20,821
(Begging alms in Italian )

894
01:16:22,950 --> 01:16:26,829
I recommend that you get
the doctor's consent all the same.

895
01:16:26,910 --> 01:16:30,869
(sighs ) The doctor's consent
would spoil it.

896
01:16:30,950 --> 01:16:34,863
You're sacrificing your health
to your curiosity, then?

897
01:16:34,950 --> 01:16:39,740
I'm not interested in my health,
I'm deeply interested in Mrs 0smond.

898
01:16:39,830 --> 01:16:41,821
so am I.

899
01:16:41,910 --> 01:16:43,866
Not as I once was.

900
01:16:43,950 --> 01:16:45,906
(Ralph coughs )

901
01:16:52,990 --> 01:16:56,300
Permit to ask whether it's
to bring out that fact

902
01:16:56,390 --> 01:16:59,427
that you're so very civil
to the little girl?

903
01:16:59,510 --> 01:17:01,944
Does that strike you as ridiculous?

904
01:17:03,070 --> 01:17:07,666
0f course, there's the difference
in our ages...more than 20 years.

905
01:17:09,110 --> 01:17:12,386
My dear Warburton...are you serious?

906
01:17:13,870 --> 01:17:17,226
Perfectly serious...
as far as I've got.

907
01:17:19,350 --> 01:17:21,306
(sighs )

908
01:17:23,750 --> 01:17:25,103
I'm glad.

909
01:17:25,190 --> 01:17:28,421
And heaven help us
how cheered up 0smond will be.

910
01:17:28,510 --> 01:17:31,627
I say, don't spoil it.
Do you judge she'll be pleased?

911
01:17:31,710 --> 01:17:34,065
The girl? Delighted, surely.

912
01:17:34,150 --> 01:17:36,584
No, no. I mean Mrs 0smond.

913
01:17:52,350 --> 01:17:54,500
(speaking Italian )

914
01:18:08,950 --> 01:18:10,906
Lord Warburton was here?

915
01:18:12,750 --> 01:18:16,060
Yes. He stayed half an hour.

916
01:18:18,710 --> 01:18:21,304
Did he talk to Pansy?

917
01:18:21,390 --> 01:18:23,540
He talked almost only to her.

918
01:18:30,430 --> 01:18:33,228
It seems to me he's attentive.

919
01:18:33,310 --> 01:18:35,141
Isn't that what you call it?

920
01:18:35,230 --> 01:18:39,826
I don't call it anything. I'm waiting
for you to give it a name.

921
01:18:39,910 --> 01:18:41,866
Will you excuse us?

922
01:18:57,670 --> 01:19:00,946
That's a consideration
you don't always show.

923
01:19:02,470 --> 01:19:07,669
I...I had determined this time
to try and act as you'd like.

924
01:19:15,790 --> 01:19:17,985
Are you trying to quarrel with me?

925
01:19:18,070 --> 01:19:21,426
No. I'm trying to live at peace.

926
01:19:21,510 --> 01:19:23,182
An excellent resolve.

927
01:19:24,390 --> 01:19:26,346
Your temper isn't good.

928
01:19:30,230 --> 01:19:35,020
That's partly why I've not spoken
about this business of my daughter's.

929
01:19:35,110 --> 01:19:38,261
I was afraid I should
encounter opposition.

930
01:19:45,030 --> 01:19:48,227
I've sent little Rosier
about his business.

931
01:19:49,310 --> 01:19:52,825
You see, I believe my daughter
only has to sit perfectly quiet

932
01:19:52,910 --> 01:19:54,582
to become Lady Warburton.

933
01:19:56,270 --> 01:19:59,228
Perhaps she won't sit
perfectly still.

934
01:19:59,310 --> 01:20:02,302
If she loses Mr Rosier,
she may jump up.

935
01:20:03,430 --> 01:20:06,581
Pansy would like to be a great lady.

936
01:20:06,670 --> 01:20:09,343
she wishes above all to please.

937
01:20:10,670 --> 01:20:12,626
To please Mr Rosier, perhaps?

938
01:20:13,870 --> 01:20:15,826
No. To please me.

939
01:20:25,270 --> 01:20:29,422
Meantime, I should like our
distinguished visitor to speak.

940
01:20:31,790 --> 01:20:34,145
He has spoken.

941
01:20:34,230 --> 01:20:38,667
He said it would be a great pleasure
to believe she could care for him.

942
01:20:39,350 --> 01:20:41,147
Why didn't you tell me that?

943
01:20:41,230 --> 01:20:43,869
There was no opportunity.

944
01:20:45,070 --> 01:20:47,026
You know how we live.

945
01:20:48,350 --> 01:20:50,739
Why didn't he speak to me, then?

946
01:20:51,510 --> 01:20:53,546
You should have patience.

947
01:20:53,630 --> 01:20:55,586
Englishmen are shy.

948
01:20:55,670 --> 01:20:58,309
This one's not,
not when he made love to you.

949
01:20:58,390 --> 01:20:59,584
I beg your pardon?

950
01:20:59,670 --> 01:21:01,467
He was extremely so.

951
01:21:01,550 --> 01:21:03,506
0h, I see.

952
01:21:06,470 --> 01:21:09,860
You must have a great deal
of influence with him.

953
01:21:10,630 --> 01:21:15,181
I'm sure the moment you really wish
it, you can bring him to the point.

954
01:21:24,510 --> 01:21:26,262
Well...

955
01:21:30,390 --> 01:21:32,142
It lies in your hands.

956
01:21:32,230 --> 01:21:34,869
I shall leave it there.

957
01:21:34,950 --> 01:21:37,828
With a little goodwill,
you may manage it.

958
01:21:39,310 --> 01:21:42,143
Think that over. Hmm?

959
01:21:43,350 --> 01:21:45,910
And remember how much I count on you.

960
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:58,752
(Ballroom music
and chattering in Italian )

961
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:03,591
It's all Pansy's.

962
01:23:03,680 --> 01:23:05,033
It must be hers.

963
01:23:05,120 --> 01:23:08,396
Yes. she gave it to me to hold.

964
01:23:08,480 --> 01:23:10,436
May I hold it?

965
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:14,956
May I at least have a flower?

966
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,719
It's frightful
what I'm doing for you.

967
01:23:29,800 --> 01:23:33,395
Don't put it in your buttonhole,
don't for the world.

968
01:23:35,120 --> 01:23:37,475
You pity me.

969
01:23:38,720 --> 01:23:40,870
But don't you pity her a little?

970
01:23:55,040 --> 01:23:56,519
(Waltz begins )

971
01:24:15,040 --> 01:24:18,271
(Warburton ) 'she's promised
a dance with me later.'

972
01:24:18,360 --> 01:24:20,476
(Isabel) 'For the cotillion?'

973
01:24:20,560 --> 01:24:23,870
'No, I didn't ask her for that.
It's a quadrille.'

974
01:24:23,960 --> 01:24:25,712
You're not clever.

975
01:24:25,800 --> 01:24:29,759
I told her to keep the cotillion
in case you should ask for it.

976
01:24:29,840 --> 01:24:32,195
Poor little maid. Fancy that.

977
01:24:32,280 --> 01:24:35,397
she didn't say.
0f course I will, if you like.

978
01:24:35,480 --> 01:24:39,075
If I like? 0h, you dance with her
only because I like it.

979
01:24:39,160 --> 01:24:41,116
I'm afraid I bore her.

980
01:24:42,200 --> 01:24:44,668
she has a lot of young fellows
on her book.

981
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:50,150
Please, let me understand.

982
01:24:50,240 --> 01:24:52,117
Understand what?

983
01:24:52,200 --> 01:24:55,272
You told me you'd like
to marry my stepdaughter,

984
01:24:55,360 --> 01:24:56,998
you've not forgotten it?

985
01:24:57,080 --> 01:25:00,436
Forgotten it? No.
I wrote to Mr 0smond this morning.

986
01:25:00,520 --> 01:25:03,273
He didn't mention to me
that he'd heard from you.

987
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:06,193
It's an awkward sort of letter
to write.

988
01:25:08,360 --> 01:25:10,316
Don't forget to send it.

989
01:25:40,720 --> 01:25:42,870
0h, most certainly.

990
01:25:45,160 --> 01:25:46,752
Are you not dancing?

991
01:25:46,840 --> 01:25:49,673
Certainly not,
if I can't dance with her.

992
01:25:51,680 --> 01:25:55,150
- You should leave, then.
- Not until she does.

993
01:26:03,080 --> 01:26:05,992
(Warburton ) Who's your dismal friend?

994
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:08,036
He has a face a yard long.

995
01:26:08,120 --> 01:26:10,076
He has reason.

996
01:26:10,160 --> 01:26:13,152
- My husband won't listen to him.
- 0h, dear me.

997
01:26:13,240 --> 01:26:16,152
He looked a well set-up young fellow.

998
01:26:16,240 --> 01:26:18,515
You've a kind thought
even for a rival.

999
01:26:19,800 --> 01:26:21,472
A rival?

1000
01:26:25,520 --> 01:26:28,159
You don't mean
that she cares for him?

1001
01:26:30,240 --> 01:26:31,912
Well, yes...

1002
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,230
I think she does.

1003
01:26:34,320 --> 01:26:38,438
You said she'd have no wish but her
father's and that he favoured me.

1004
01:26:38,520 --> 01:26:41,956
I told you she had an immense wish
to please her father.

1005
01:26:43,640 --> 01:26:45,596
That seems very proper.

1006
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:48,393
Very proper...

1007
01:26:53,920 --> 01:26:59,233
but hardly the sort of feeling a man
would wish to be indebted for a wife.

1008
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:07,316
Why are you so unwilling,
so...sceptical?

1009
01:27:24,440 --> 01:27:27,910
- You're the most wonderful dancer.
- 0h, thank you.

1010
01:28:05,880 --> 01:28:08,440
I want you to answer me a question.

1011
01:28:10,360 --> 01:28:12,316
It's about Lord Warburton.

1012
01:28:13,680 --> 01:28:15,636
(Clears throat)

1013
01:28:16,960 --> 01:28:18,916
Is...

1014
01:28:20,200 --> 01:28:22,555
Is he really in love?

1015
01:28:26,720 --> 01:28:29,553
Yes, I think, very much.
I can make that out.

1016
01:28:29,640 --> 01:28:31,198
0h.

1017
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:35,075
You seem disappointed.

1018
01:28:37,920 --> 01:28:39,273
No...

1019
01:28:40,840 --> 01:28:43,593
No, only mistaken.

1020
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:49,390
I'd made out that
he doesn't really care for Pansy.

1021
01:28:49,480 --> 01:28:51,471
0h, for Pansy, no.

1022
01:28:52,200 --> 01:28:54,316
But you just said now that he did.

1023
01:28:54,400 --> 01:28:56,356
That he cared for you.

1024
01:28:59,920 --> 01:29:03,674
- That is nonsense, you know.
- To me, he's denied it.

1025
01:29:11,920 --> 01:29:13,876
Ralph...

1026
01:29:15,720 --> 01:29:17,676
you give me no help.

1027
01:29:23,840 --> 01:29:25,910
How unhappy you must be.

1028
01:29:38,240 --> 01:29:41,755
When... When I talk of
your helping me, I...

1029
01:29:41,840 --> 01:29:44,354
I- I talk great nonsense.

1030
01:29:44,440 --> 01:29:49,275
The idea of troubling you
with my domestic embarrassments...

1031
01:29:50,040 --> 01:29:52,554
Your husband may think you haven't...

1032
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:54,278
pushed enough.

1033
01:29:54,360 --> 01:29:57,113
It's a matter we can hardly
quarrel about,

1034
01:29:57,200 --> 01:30:00,351
for almost all of the interest
is on his side.

1035
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:04,319
You know what his interest
will make him say?

1036
01:30:04,400 --> 01:30:08,473
It will make him say that your lack
of zeal is owing to jealousy.

1037
01:30:08,560 --> 01:30:11,552
- To jealousy?
- To jealousy of his daughter.

1038
01:30:13,080 --> 01:30:15,469
0h, you're not kind.

1039
01:30:16,440 --> 01:30:19,000
Be frank with me, and you'll see.

1040
01:31:10,400 --> 01:31:12,755
If I try to learn what you want...

1041
01:31:14,840 --> 01:31:16,751
what you desire...

1042
01:31:20,040 --> 01:31:22,918
it's only so that
I may act accordingly.

1043
01:31:25,200 --> 01:31:29,955
The only thing I want in life...
is to marry Mr Rosier.

1044
01:31:32,320 --> 01:31:35,915
Your father would like you
to make a better marriage.

1045
01:31:40,080 --> 01:31:42,150
What should you like me to do?

1046
01:31:42,240 --> 01:31:44,356
Lord Warburton...

1047
01:31:46,160 --> 01:31:48,196
has shown you great attention.

1048
01:31:48,280 --> 01:31:51,670
If you mean that
he'll propose for me,

1049
01:31:51,760 --> 01:31:54,354
I think you're mistaken.

1050
01:31:57,960 --> 01:32:00,474
Your father
would like it extremely.

1051
01:32:00,560 --> 01:32:04,030
Lord Warburton won't propose
simply to please Papa.

1052
01:32:04,120 --> 01:32:06,759
0h, no. There's no danger.

1053
01:32:07,240 --> 01:32:09,196
There's no danger.

1054
01:32:09,560 --> 01:32:11,073
It's as if he said to me,

1055
01:32:11,160 --> 01:32:14,232
"I like you very much,
but if it doesn't please you,

1056
01:32:14,320 --> 01:32:16,629
"I would never say it again."

1057
01:32:18,160 --> 01:32:21,311
And...he doesn't
care for me, either.

1058
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:24,994
0h, no. There's no danger.

1059
01:32:25,080 --> 01:32:27,514
You must tell your father that.

1060
01:32:30,520 --> 01:32:32,112
I'd rather not.

1061
01:32:34,240 --> 01:32:37,073
You wouldn't let him have
false hopes?

1062
01:32:39,880 --> 01:32:43,316
But it will be good for me
that he should.

1063
01:32:43,400 --> 01:32:46,073
Then Papa won't propose
anyone else...

1064
01:32:46,160 --> 01:32:49,869
and that will be
a great advantage for me.

1065
01:32:55,600 --> 01:32:57,079
(Whispering) Rosier.

1066
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:08,834
Does Warburton form his words
with such difficulty?

1067
01:33:10,280 --> 01:33:11,713
Hmm?

1068
01:33:12,760 --> 01:33:16,514
When he told you he intended to
write, what did you say to him?

1069
01:33:18,200 --> 01:33:20,316
I think I told him not to forget it.

1070
01:33:20,400 --> 01:33:23,710
Apparently, he has forgotten.
Please remind him.

1071
01:33:23,800 --> 01:33:27,509
If hands are to be laid on
Lord Warburton, lay them yourself.

1072
01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:29,989
It's hard with you
working against me.

1073
01:33:30,080 --> 01:33:31,991
I told you I'd do what I could.

1074
01:33:32,080 --> 01:33:34,753
Yes, that gained you time.

1075
01:33:36,720 --> 01:33:39,632
My husband and I were
just now talking of you.

1076
01:33:39,720 --> 01:33:44,316
We wondered what had become of you.
We thought perhaps you'd gone away.

1077
01:33:45,400 --> 01:33:47,231
I'm only on the point of going.

1078
01:33:47,320 --> 01:33:50,312
I find myself suddenly
recalled to England.

1079
01:33:50,400 --> 01:33:53,312
I'm awfully sorry
to leave poor Touchett.

1080
01:33:53,400 --> 01:33:55,630
Take poor Touchett with you.

1081
01:33:55,720 --> 01:33:58,109
He'd better wait for warmer weather.

1082
01:33:58,200 --> 01:34:01,476
I shouldn't advise him
to...to travel just now.

1083
01:34:01,560 --> 01:34:03,039
Hmm.

1084
01:34:03,120 --> 01:34:06,954
I have a letter to write
before dinner. Will you excuse me?

1085
01:34:07,040 --> 01:34:10,919
0f course, when you come to Rome,
you'll always look us up.

1086
01:34:22,120 --> 01:34:24,350
I'm glad it's the last time.

1087
01:34:27,280 --> 01:34:28,633
so am I.

1088
01:34:28,720 --> 01:34:30,711
she doesn't care for me.

1089
01:34:47,440 --> 01:34:49,396
Good night, Papa.

1090
01:34:50,120 --> 01:34:52,236
Good night. sleep well.

1091
01:34:56,560 --> 01:34:59,358
Don't go. I have
something to say to you.

1092
01:35:25,120 --> 01:35:27,839
I don't understand
what you wish to do.

1093
01:35:27,920 --> 01:35:30,229
I wish to go to bed. I'm very tired.

1094
01:35:38,440 --> 01:35:41,830
I think you're trying
to humiliate me.

1095
01:35:41,920 --> 01:35:44,388
You're playing a very deep game.

1096
01:35:44,480 --> 01:35:46,550
You've managed it beautifully.

1097
01:35:48,640 --> 01:35:50,039
What have I managed?

1098
01:35:50,120 --> 01:35:53,510
You've kept this matter
quite in your own hands.

1099
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:58,151
Will you tell me in the plainest
words of what it is you accuse me?

1100
01:36:00,320 --> 01:36:03,995
0f having prevented
Pansy's marriage to Warburton.

1101
01:36:04,080 --> 01:36:05,593
Are those words plain enough?

1102
01:36:05,680 --> 01:36:09,036
0n the contrary,
I took great interest in it.

1103
01:36:09,120 --> 01:36:12,351
When you counted on me,
I accepted the obligation.

1104
01:36:12,440 --> 01:36:13,759
I was a fool, but I did it.

1105
01:36:14,800 --> 01:36:16,153
You pretended to do it.

1106
01:36:16,240 --> 01:36:19,232
Where is the letter
you told me he'd written?

1107
01:36:20,520 --> 01:36:21,999
I haven't the least idea.

1108
01:36:23,360 --> 01:36:25,510
No, you destroyed it.

1109
01:36:29,720 --> 01:36:32,393
0h, Gilbert, for a man
who was so fine...

1110
01:36:32,480 --> 01:36:34,232
I was never so fine as you.

1111
01:36:34,320 --> 01:36:36,880
You've done everything
that you wanted.

1112
01:36:36,960 --> 01:36:39,599
You got him out of the way
without appearing to,

1113
01:36:39,680 --> 01:36:43,309
and you've placed me in the position
in which you wish to see me.

1114
01:36:43,400 --> 01:36:46,437
As a man who tried to marry
his daughter to a Lord,

1115
01:36:46,520 --> 01:36:48,158
but grotesquely failed.

1116
01:36:48,240 --> 01:36:51,471
- Pansy doesn't care for him.
- That has nothing to do with it!

1117
01:36:51,560 --> 01:36:55,712
- And he doesn't...
- That won't do! You told me he did!

1118
01:36:55,800 --> 01:36:59,395
After this, you must attend
to such things yourself.

1119
01:37:13,520 --> 01:37:16,796
I always thought you were
fond of my daughter.

1120
01:37:16,880 --> 01:37:19,838
I have never been more so than now.

1121
01:37:19,920 --> 01:37:22,480
Your affection has immense
limitations.

1122
01:37:22,560 --> 01:37:24,994
However, that, perhaps, is natural.

1123
01:37:25,080 --> 01:37:27,514
Is that all you wish to say to me?

1124
01:37:28,360 --> 01:37:31,158
Are you satisfied? Huh?

1125
01:37:32,920 --> 01:37:35,559
Am I sufficiently disappointed?

1126
01:37:35,640 --> 01:37:39,553
I don't think, on the whole,
you're disappointed.

1127
01:37:39,640 --> 01:37:43,235
You've had another opportunity
to try to stupefy me.

1128
01:37:54,040 --> 01:37:56,190
It's not that.

1129
01:37:57,520 --> 01:38:00,159
It's proved that Pansy can aim high.

1130
01:38:48,480 --> 01:38:52,155
I suppose you know you can't
go back to England alone.

1131
01:38:52,240 --> 01:38:56,916
(Clears throat) I had no idea of
doing that. I'll have people with me.

1132
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:58,718
What do you mean by people?

1133
01:38:58,800 --> 01:39:00,836
servants whom you pay?

1134
01:39:04,360 --> 01:39:06,555
After all, they're human beings.

1135
01:39:07,840 --> 01:39:10,115
I guess I'll go with you.

1136
01:39:10,200 --> 01:39:12,509
- (Clears throat) Go with me?
- Yes.

1137
01:39:12,600 --> 01:39:16,229
I know you don't like me
but I'll go with you.

1138
01:39:17,280 --> 01:39:20,113
And what's more,
I'll take care of you.

1139
01:39:22,880 --> 01:39:24,313
I like you very much.

1140
01:39:24,400 --> 01:39:26,834
You needn't think
you can buy me off.

1141
01:39:26,920 --> 01:39:30,071
I'm afraid I shall be
a fifth wheel to the coach.

1142
01:39:30,160 --> 01:39:32,720
Mrs 0smond wants me
to travel with you.

1143
01:39:34,840 --> 01:39:37,274
But that isn't the principal thing.

1144
01:39:37,360 --> 01:39:40,670
The principal thing is
she wants me to leave Rome.

1145
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,036
she wants us all to leave Rome.

1146
01:39:44,120 --> 01:39:46,076
(speaking Italian )

1147
01:40:00,960 --> 01:40:02,996
It's wonderfully good of you.

1148
01:40:03,080 --> 01:40:05,719
I can't tell you how kind
I think you.

1149
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:09,753
With a few words like that,
you make me go?

1150
01:40:09,840 --> 01:40:13,310
- You must come back someday.
- I don't care for your cousin.

1151
01:40:13,400 --> 01:40:15,311
Is that what you wish to tell me?

1152
01:40:15,400 --> 01:40:18,949
No. No, I don't want
to TELL you anything.

1153
01:40:20,320 --> 01:40:22,993
I can't understand.
What am I to believe?

1154
01:40:23,080 --> 01:40:25,389
What do you want me to think?

1155
01:40:25,480 --> 01:40:29,359
If you're happy, I'd like to know it.
That would be something for me.

1156
01:40:29,440 --> 01:40:31,032
You sAY you're happy,

1157
01:40:31,120 --> 01:40:33,111
and yet, somehow, you're so...

1158
01:40:33,200 --> 01:40:35,760
still, so smooth...

1159
01:40:35,840 --> 01:40:37,796
so hard.

1160
01:40:39,120 --> 01:40:42,590
You're completely changed.
You conceal everything.

1161
01:40:43,320 --> 01:40:46,915
- I haven't really come near you.
- You come very near.

1162
01:41:02,720 --> 01:41:05,712
You seem uncommonly glad
to get rid of us all.

1163
01:41:11,400 --> 01:41:13,072
My dear Ralph.

1164
01:41:16,320 --> 01:41:18,914
I've seen less of you
than I might have,

1165
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:21,230
but it's been better than nothing.

1166
01:41:22,600 --> 01:41:24,750
I've heard a great deal about you.

1167
01:41:25,840 --> 01:41:29,435
I don't know from whom,
living the life you've done.

1168
01:41:30,400 --> 01:41:32,550
From the voices of the air.

1169
01:41:40,600 --> 01:41:42,591
You've been my best friend.

1170
01:41:46,920 --> 01:41:49,718
It was for you
that I wanted to live,

1171
01:41:49,800 --> 01:41:51,995
but I'm of no use to you.

1172
01:41:52,920 --> 01:41:54,717
(speaking Italian )

1173
01:42:03,680 --> 01:42:05,955
If you should send for me...

1174
01:42:07,640 --> 01:42:09,119
I'd come.

1175
01:42:09,200 --> 01:42:11,555
Your husband
won't consent to that.

1176
01:42:11,640 --> 01:42:13,631
No, he won't like it,

1177
01:42:13,760 --> 01:42:16,320
but I might go all the same.

1178
01:42:21,920 --> 01:42:26,835
I'd hoped to find Lord Warburton here
and to be able to congratulate Pansy.

1179
01:42:26,920 --> 01:42:30,310
You shouldn't have gone to Naples,
but stayed to watch.

1180
01:42:30,400 --> 01:42:31,958
Is it too late?

1181
01:42:32,040 --> 01:42:34,190
It's all over. Please...

1182
01:42:34,280 --> 01:42:35,838
just let it rest.

1183
01:42:35,920 --> 01:42:39,356
I've no doubt 0smond will
happily discuss it with you.

1184
01:42:39,440 --> 01:42:43,513
0h, I know what he thinks.
He came to see me last evening.

1185
01:42:46,040 --> 01:42:47,598
As soon as you arrived?

1186
01:42:50,360 --> 01:42:52,749
Your husband judges you severely.

1187
01:42:57,160 --> 01:43:00,072
Wait. Please.

1188
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,878
I want, if possible,
to learn the truth.

1189
01:43:19,960 --> 01:43:22,030
What truth do you speak of?

1190
01:43:23,280 --> 01:43:25,874
Just this...

1191
01:43:27,760 --> 01:43:32,788
whether Lord Warburton changed
his mind quite of his own accord

1192
01:43:32,880 --> 01:43:35,030
or because you recommended it.

1193
01:43:36,360 --> 01:43:39,397
To please himself,
I mean, or to please you?

1194
01:43:39,480 --> 01:43:42,313
Now, don't be unreasonable.

1195
01:43:42,400 --> 01:43:44,118
Don't take offence.

1196
01:43:48,680 --> 01:43:51,911
If Lord Warburton simply
got tired of the child,

1197
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,389
that's one thing, and it's a pity.

1198
01:43:55,400 --> 01:43:58,392
But if he gave her up to please you,

1199
01:43:59,480 --> 01:44:01,550
that's another.

1200
01:44:01,640 --> 01:44:03,915
If that's the case...

1201
01:44:04,920 --> 01:44:06,876
let him off, let us have him.

1202
01:44:09,640 --> 01:44:11,232
Who are you?

1203
01:44:11,320 --> 01:44:13,550
Ah, you take it like that.

1204
01:44:14,480 --> 01:44:16,550
What have you to do with me?

1205
01:44:21,200 --> 01:44:22,792
Everything.

1206
01:44:30,161 --> 01:44:33,358
(serena ) I would give my right hand
to be able to weep.

1207
01:44:33,441 --> 01:44:35,477
What good would it do you to weep?

1208
01:44:38,001 --> 01:44:39,878
It would make me feel...

1209
01:44:41,241 --> 01:44:43,197
as I felt before I knew you.

1210
01:44:48,001 --> 01:44:50,640
If I've dried up your tears,
that's something,

1211
01:44:50,721 --> 01:44:52,677
but I've seen you shed them.

1212
01:44:52,761 --> 01:44:56,276
You'll make me cry still,
make me howl like a wolf.

1213
01:44:57,361 --> 01:44:59,033
I've a great need of that.

1214
01:44:59,121 --> 01:45:02,158
I was vile this afternoon.
I was horrid.

1215
01:45:04,761 --> 01:45:07,753
You may have said things
that were in bad taste.

1216
01:45:07,841 --> 01:45:09,832
I was full of something bad...

1217
01:45:13,081 --> 01:45:16,630
or something good, I don't know,
I couldn't help it.

1218
01:45:21,161 --> 01:45:25,154
You've not only dried up my tears,
you've dried up my soul.

1219
01:45:25,241 --> 01:45:27,357
You're very bad.

1220
01:45:38,841 --> 01:45:40,593
Is this the way we're to end?

1221
01:45:44,161 --> 01:45:46,117
How do bad people end?

1222
01:45:48,241 --> 01:45:50,835
Especially as to their common crimes?

1223
01:45:53,801 --> 01:45:57,157
You have made me as bad as yourself.

1224
01:45:57,241 --> 01:45:59,471
You seem to me quite good enough.

1225
01:46:08,041 --> 01:46:09,952
0h, God!

1226
01:46:10,041 --> 01:46:12,191
God!

1227
01:46:12,281 --> 01:46:14,033
(screams )

1228
01:46:14,481 --> 01:46:16,676
so you're going to weep after all?

1229
01:46:16,761 --> 01:46:18,672
Have I ever complained to you?

1230
01:46:18,761 --> 01:46:22,834
0f course you haven't,
you've enjoyed your triumph too much.

1231
01:46:24,161 --> 01:46:27,119
You made your wife
afraid of you, she was...

1232
01:46:27,521 --> 01:46:31,560
she was afraid of me today,
but it was really you she feared.

1233
01:46:31,641 --> 01:46:34,474
This whole idea
didn't originate with me.

1234
01:46:34,561 --> 01:46:36,517
Your genius brought it about.

1235
01:46:36,601 --> 01:46:38,671
I only ask that my wife
should like me.

1236
01:46:39,281 --> 01:46:42,114
0h, Jesus, she should
like you so much?

1237
01:46:42,201 --> 01:46:46,479
If you'll make a tragedy of that,
the tragedy is hardly for her.

1238
01:46:46,561 --> 01:46:48,552
It's for me.

1239
01:46:51,121 --> 01:46:54,193
I live with the consequences,
so must you.

1240
01:46:57,281 --> 01:47:00,353
Please be careful
with that precious object.

1241
01:47:00,441 --> 01:47:03,160
It already has a wee bit
of a tiny crack.

1242
01:47:11,361 --> 01:47:15,320
However, since my wife
doesn't like me,

1243
01:47:15,401 --> 01:47:18,313
I shall look for
compensation in Pansy.

1244
01:47:19,441 --> 01:47:22,513
Fortunately, I haven't a fault
to find with her.

1245
01:47:25,681 --> 01:47:27,637
(Children begging)

1246
01:47:28,841 --> 01:47:33,471
Mia! Listen to me. 0h! Leave me.

1247
01:47:39,481 --> 01:47:41,233
Pansy!

1248
01:47:46,641 --> 01:47:48,791
- 0h...
- Pansy.

1249
01:47:50,961 --> 01:47:53,475
Pansy? Pansy?

1250
01:47:54,321 --> 01:47:57,597
- Mrs 0smond? Mrs 0smond!
- Pansy.

1251
01:47:57,681 --> 01:47:59,751
Mrs 0smond!

1252
01:47:59,841 --> 01:48:01,399
I've been in Paris!

1253
01:48:01,481 --> 01:48:03,278
I've sold my bibelots!

1254
01:48:03,361 --> 01:48:06,637
The result's magnificent, $50,000!

1255
01:48:07,601 --> 01:48:10,354
Will Mr 0smond think me
rich enough now?

1256
01:48:14,001 --> 01:48:15,354
0h...

1257
01:48:16,921 --> 01:48:22,678
Pipi...eat your food.
Very good. Pipi.

1258
01:48:23,281 --> 01:48:25,749
0h.

1259
01:48:25,841 --> 01:48:27,797
(speaking Italian )

1260
01:48:41,561 --> 01:48:43,517
Is Pansy not well?

1261
01:48:46,161 --> 01:48:47,879
No. she is quite well,

1262
01:48:47,961 --> 01:48:50,316
but I've sent her to the convent.

1263
01:48:50,401 --> 01:48:54,838
I didn't speak of it to you because
I doubt if I can make you understand.

1264
01:48:54,921 --> 01:48:57,913
0ne's daughter should be
fresh and fair.

1265
01:48:58,001 --> 01:49:01,710
Pansy's a little dusty,
a little dishevelled.

1266
01:49:01,801 --> 01:49:04,361
she'll have time to think,

1267
01:49:04,441 --> 01:49:07,672
and there's something I want her
to think about.

1268
01:49:07,761 --> 01:49:10,116
It's very absurd, my dear 0smond.

1269
01:49:10,201 --> 01:49:13,398
Why don't you just say
you want to get her out of my way?

1270
01:49:15,121 --> 01:49:17,316
My dear Amy, if that were the case,

1271
01:49:17,401 --> 01:49:20,120
it would be much simpler
to banish you.

1272
01:49:20,201 --> 01:49:23,193
( Amy ) You know I think
very well of Mr Rosier.

1273
01:49:23,281 --> 01:49:24,680
I do, indeed.

1274
01:49:24,761 --> 01:49:27,594
He seems to be simpaticissimo.

1275
01:49:28,121 --> 01:49:31,511
He's made me believe in,
ah, true love.

1276
01:50:02,960 --> 01:50:06,316
0h... Excuse me
for disturbing you.

1277
01:50:06,400 --> 01:50:09,233
When I come into your room,
I always knock.

1278
01:50:09,320 --> 01:50:11,151
I forgot.

1279
01:50:12,240 --> 01:50:15,198
I had something else to think of.

1280
01:50:15,280 --> 01:50:17,032
My cousin's dying.

1281
01:50:17,880 --> 01:50:19,711
I don't believe that.

1282
01:50:19,800 --> 01:50:22,758
He was dying when we married.
He'll outlive us all.

1283
01:50:22,840 --> 01:50:24,637
My aunt telegraphed for me.

1284
01:50:26,480 --> 01:50:28,436
I must go to England.

1285
01:50:29,280 --> 01:50:34,308
- I don't see the need of it.
- I must see Ralph before he dies.

1286
01:50:35,720 --> 01:50:38,234
I shall not like it if you do.

1287
01:50:38,320 --> 01:50:40,276
You won't like it if I don't.

1288
01:50:42,560 --> 01:50:44,630
You like nothing I do or don't do.

1289
01:50:46,960 --> 01:50:49,155
You pretend to think I lie.

1290
01:50:53,480 --> 01:50:55,516
That's why you go, then?

1291
01:50:55,600 --> 01:50:59,354
Not to see your cousin,
but to take revenge on me?

1292
01:51:01,520 --> 01:51:04,830
You wish immensely
I would commit some folly.

1293
01:51:10,640 --> 01:51:14,758
If you leave Rome today, it will be
an act of the most deliberate,

1294
01:51:14,840 --> 01:51:17,274
the most calculated opposition.

1295
01:51:18,640 --> 01:51:21,438
I can't tell you
how unjust you seem to me.

1296
01:51:23,520 --> 01:51:26,512
It's your own opposition
that's calculated.

1297
01:51:27,960 --> 01:51:29,712
It's malignant.

1298
01:51:41,800 --> 01:51:45,509
I have an ideal of what my wife
should do and should not do.

1299
01:51:45,600 --> 01:51:50,628
she should not travel across Europe
to sit at the bedside of other men.

1300
01:51:50,720 --> 01:51:54,269
Your cousin is nothing to you.
He's nothing to us.

1301
01:51:55,200 --> 01:51:59,398
You smile most expressively
when I talk about us,

1302
01:51:59,480 --> 01:52:02,278
but I assure you that we...

1303
01:52:02,360 --> 01:52:04,510
we, Mrs 0smond...

1304
01:52:07,240 --> 01:52:09,196
is all I know.

1305
01:52:12,960 --> 01:52:16,873
You are nearer to me
than any other human creature,

1306
01:52:16,960 --> 01:52:19,155
and I am nearer to you.

1307
01:52:19,240 --> 01:52:21,595
It may be a disagreeable proximity,

1308
01:52:21,680 --> 01:52:24,831
but it is one of our own
deliberate making.

1309
01:52:26,160 --> 01:52:29,550
You don't like to be
reminded of that, I know...

1310
01:52:30,960 --> 01:52:33,713
but I am
perfectly willing, because...

1311
01:52:35,480 --> 01:52:40,031
because I believe we should accept
the consequences of our actions...

1312
01:52:41,600 --> 01:52:45,752
and what I value most in life
is the honour of the thing.

1313
01:53:30,249 --> 01:53:32,285
0h! My dear.

1314
01:53:32,369 --> 01:53:34,803
Do tell me some amusing book to read.

1315
01:53:34,889 --> 01:53:36,527
Would this do me any good?

1316
01:53:38,249 --> 01:53:40,444
My cousin, Ralph Touchett, is dying.

1317
01:53:40,529 --> 01:53:44,602
0h... He was so simpatico.

1318
01:53:44,689 --> 01:53:47,123
I'm awfully sorry for you.

1319
01:53:49,889 --> 01:53:51,322
You look very badly.

1320
01:53:51,409 --> 01:53:54,640
0smond says it's impossible
I should go to England.

1321
01:53:54,729 --> 01:53:58,278
And why does 0smond say
it's impossible?

1322
01:53:58,369 --> 01:54:00,485
Because we're so happy together

1323
01:54:00,569 --> 01:54:03,447
that we can't separate,
even for a fortnight.

1324
01:54:31,609 --> 01:54:33,440
You're very unhappy.

1325
01:54:35,889 --> 01:54:37,402
Yes.

1326
01:54:38,929 --> 01:54:41,648
But I don't think you can comfort me.

1327
01:54:42,809 --> 01:54:45,528
Will you give me leave to try?

1328
01:54:45,609 --> 01:54:48,840
There is something
I want you to know.

1329
01:54:50,289 --> 01:54:53,725
Perhaps you do.
Perhaps you've guessed it.

1330
01:54:53,809 --> 01:54:58,599
0h, in your place
I should have guessed it ages ago.

1331
01:54:58,689 --> 01:55:00,805
Have you never really suspected?

1332
01:55:04,729 --> 01:55:06,606
suspected what?

1333
01:55:06,689 --> 01:55:09,249
My first sister-in-law
had no children.

1334
01:55:12,529 --> 01:55:16,886
The poor woman was married hardly
three years and died childless.

1335
01:55:20,329 --> 01:55:22,718
Pansy's not my husband's child, then?

1336
01:55:22,809 --> 01:55:26,961
0h, your husband's in perfection,
but not his wife's.

1337
01:55:27,969 --> 01:55:32,201
0h, my dear Isabel,
with you, one must dot one's i's.

1338
01:55:32,289 --> 01:55:34,120
Whose child?

1339
01:55:34,209 --> 01:55:38,566
0h, she's been wonderfully clever,
magnificent about Pansy.

1340
01:55:38,649 --> 01:55:40,765
(Gasping and sobbing)

1341
01:55:45,049 --> 01:55:47,165
Had it never occurred to you

1342
01:55:47,249 --> 01:55:51,288
that serena Merle
was for six or seven years his lover?

1343
01:55:56,009 --> 01:55:58,159
At last you understand.

1344
01:56:30,809 --> 01:56:32,367
(speaking Italian )

1345
01:56:38,289 --> 01:56:40,439
You're surprised to find me here.

1346
01:56:41,649 --> 01:56:44,288
And I'm afraid you're not pleased.

1347
01:56:47,729 --> 01:56:52,325
I confess I've been indiscreet,
I ought to have asked permission.

1348
01:56:56,489 --> 01:56:58,445
I came to see Pansy.

1349
01:56:59,689 --> 01:57:03,648
It occurred to me this afternoon
that she must be rather lonely.

1350
01:57:14,329 --> 01:57:16,285
That it's a little dismal.

1351
01:57:20,569 --> 01:57:22,719
so I came, on...

1352
01:57:26,329 --> 01:57:28,285
the chance...

1353
01:57:42,689 --> 01:57:44,645
(Nun speaking Italian )

1354
01:58:13,289 --> 01:58:15,644
Don't you think I've made it pretty?

1355
01:58:15,729 --> 01:58:19,278
Yes. It seems...it seems comfortable.

1356
01:58:21,929 --> 01:58:24,682
I've come to bid you goodbye.

1357
01:58:24,769 --> 01:58:26,725
I'm going to England.

1358
01:58:32,249 --> 01:58:34,205
Not to come back?

1359
01:58:35,489 --> 01:58:37,445
My cousin is very ill.

1360
01:58:42,169 --> 01:58:44,125
Don't leave me here.

1361
01:58:44,209 --> 01:58:46,723
Will you come with me now?

1362
01:58:46,809 --> 01:58:49,084
Did Papa tell you to ask me that?

1363
01:58:50,009 --> 01:58:51,965
No. It's my own proposal.

1364
01:58:56,849 --> 01:58:58,885
I had better wait, then.

1365
01:59:00,009 --> 01:59:03,718
He thinks I have not
had enough, but I have.

1366
01:59:03,809 --> 01:59:08,041
He wished me to think a little,
and I have thought a great deal.

1367
01:59:08,129 --> 01:59:10,438
What have you thought?

1368
01:59:10,529 --> 01:59:12,884
That I must never displease Papa.

1369
01:59:16,129 --> 01:59:18,723
Grazie.

1370
01:59:22,329 --> 01:59:25,002
- (Gasps )
- I found I wished to wait for you.

1371
01:59:25,089 --> 01:59:27,398
But it's not to talk about Pansy.

1372
01:59:27,489 --> 01:59:29,559
Are you very fond of your cousin?

1373
01:59:29,649 --> 01:59:33,278
- I don't understand you.
- It's hard to explain.

1374
01:59:35,769 --> 01:59:38,761
Your cousin once did you
a great service. Have you...

1375
01:59:38,849 --> 01:59:40,248
never guessed it?

1376
01:59:40,329 --> 01:59:42,285
He made you rich.

1377
01:59:44,849 --> 01:59:46,407
He made me?

1378
01:59:46,489 --> 01:59:50,368
It was your uncle's money,
but it was your cousin's idea.

1379
01:59:50,449 --> 01:59:52,485
He brought his father over to it.

1380
01:59:52,569 --> 01:59:55,288
I don't know why
you say such things.

1381
01:59:55,369 --> 02:00:00,124
- I don't know how you know.
- I know only what I've guessed,

1382
02:00:00,209 --> 02:00:03,167
and I've guessed that.

1383
02:00:03,249 --> 02:00:06,127
At bottom, it's him you've to thank.

1384
02:00:06,209 --> 02:00:08,848
I believed it was you I had to thank.

1385
02:00:12,889 --> 02:00:15,039
You're very unhappy, I know.

1386
02:00:15,129 --> 02:00:17,848
But I'm more so.

1387
02:00:24,369 --> 02:00:26,121
(Thunder)

1388
02:01:05,400 --> 02:01:09,154
Hello. Isn't it wonderful she's come?

1389
02:01:11,280 --> 02:01:13,748
- How was the channel?
- Very fine.

1390
02:01:15,400 --> 02:01:16,879
No.

1391
02:01:17,880 --> 02:01:19,950
No, I believe it was very rough.

1392
02:02:05,360 --> 02:02:06,873
(Dogs barking)

1393
02:02:08,040 --> 02:02:10,395
(Isabel) Will he see me?

1394
02:02:10,480 --> 02:02:12,436
Can he speak to me?

1395
02:02:12,520 --> 02:02:14,715
(Mrs Touchett) You can try him.

1396
02:02:14,800 --> 02:02:18,076
- Is there really no hope?
- None whatsoever.

1397
02:02:18,160 --> 02:02:20,116
There never has been.

1398
02:02:36,240 --> 02:02:38,356
(Muttering)

1399
02:03:48,280 --> 02:03:50,396
It's very good of you to come.

1400
02:03:53,080 --> 02:03:55,594
I thought you would,
but I wasn't sure.

1401
02:03:55,680 --> 02:03:57,398
I wasn't sure, either...

1402
02:03:58,560 --> 02:04:00,596
till I came.

1403
02:04:04,640 --> 02:04:06,995
With me it's all over.

1404
02:04:10,040 --> 02:04:11,996
Isabel...

1405
02:04:15,840 --> 02:04:18,149
I wish it were over for you.

1406
02:04:23,560 --> 02:04:26,632
What is it you have done
for me in leaving Rome?

1407
02:04:28,800 --> 02:04:30,995
What is it you did for me?

1408
02:04:33,160 --> 02:04:35,310
You did something once.

1409
02:04:36,320 --> 02:04:38,436
You know it.

1410
02:04:40,680 --> 02:04:42,636
0h...

1411
02:04:44,360 --> 02:04:46,351
Ralph.

1412
02:04:46,440 --> 02:04:48,431
Keep me in your heart.

1413
02:04:48,520 --> 02:04:51,478
I shall be nearer to you
than I've ever been.

1414
02:04:52,400 --> 02:04:57,076
(sobbing) I never thanked you.

1415
02:04:57,160 --> 02:04:59,549
I...I never spoke.

1416
02:05:00,680 --> 02:05:03,035
I never was what I should be.

1417
02:05:04,640 --> 02:05:07,154
Yet how could I know?
I only know today

1418
02:05:07,240 --> 02:05:10,516
because there are people
less stupid than I.

1419
02:05:10,600 --> 02:05:12,795
Don't mind people.

1420
02:05:18,480 --> 02:05:20,869
Is it true?

1421
02:05:20,960 --> 02:05:23,076
That you've been stupid?

1422
02:05:24,040 --> 02:05:25,871
No.

1423
02:05:27,480 --> 02:05:30,040
He married me for the money.

1424
02:05:35,200 --> 02:05:37,760
I only want you to understand.

1425
02:05:37,840 --> 02:05:40,991
I always tried
to keep you from understanding.

1426
02:05:42,920 --> 02:05:45,150
But that's all over.

1427
02:05:49,120 --> 02:05:51,315
Was he very bad about your coming?

1428
02:05:51,400 --> 02:05:53,675
He made it very hard for me...

1429
02:05:53,760 --> 02:05:55,716
but I don't care.

1430
02:05:56,240 --> 02:05:59,710
Here...with you...

1431
02:06:02,160 --> 02:06:05,152
I'm happier than I've been
in a long time.

1432
02:06:07,480 --> 02:06:10,631
I want you to be happy.

1433
02:06:10,720 --> 02:06:12,676
To feel that I'm near you.

1434
02:06:16,040 --> 02:06:18,395
That I love you.

1435
02:06:21,400 --> 02:06:23,391
Why should there be pain?

1436
02:06:24,480 --> 02:06:26,550
That's not the deepest thing.

1437
02:06:39,240 --> 02:06:41,435
You must stay here.

1438
02:06:46,520 --> 02:06:48,397
Pain's deep...

1439
02:06:49,160 --> 02:06:52,072
but it...passes, after all.

1440
02:06:52,160 --> 02:06:53,957
- It's passing now.
- 0h...

1441
02:06:54,040 --> 02:06:56,031
But love remains.

1442
02:06:59,520 --> 02:07:02,239
I don't know why
we should suffer so much,

1443
02:07:02,320 --> 02:07:04,038
perhaps I should find out.

1444
02:07:05,640 --> 02:07:07,198
shh...

1445
02:07:12,560 --> 02:07:14,516
I don't believe...

1446
02:07:17,960 --> 02:07:21,191
I don't believe
such a generous mistake as yours

1447
02:07:21,280 --> 02:07:23,635
can hurt you
for more than a little.

1448
02:07:26,280 --> 02:07:28,475
And remember this...

1449
02:07:28,560 --> 02:07:30,630
that if you have been hated,

1450
02:07:30,720 --> 02:07:32,676
you've also been loved.

1451
02:07:35,480 --> 02:07:38,074
0h, but, Isabel...

1452
02:07:40,880 --> 02:07:42,996
..adored.

1453
02:08:55,720 --> 02:08:58,075
(Minister) Man that is born of woman

1454
02:08:58,160 --> 02:09:02,119
has but a short time to live
and is full of misery.

1455
02:09:02,200 --> 02:09:05,033
He cometh up and is cut down
like a flower.

1456
02:09:05,120 --> 02:09:10,353
He fleeth as it were a shadow
and never continueth upon this day.

1457
02:09:10,440 --> 02:09:12,795
In the midst of life
we are in death.

1458
02:09:12,880 --> 02:09:15,997
0f whom may we seek for succour
but of thee, o Lord,

1459
02:09:16,080 --> 02:09:19,516
who for our sins
art justly mispleased?

1460
02:09:37,560 --> 02:09:39,357
(Whispering) I adore him.

1461
02:09:41,280 --> 02:09:43,191
I adore him.

1462
02:09:53,480 --> 02:09:56,517
I adore him.

1463
02:09:57,280 --> 02:09:59,510
(Gasps ) 0h.

1464
02:10:01,400 --> 02:10:03,152
You frightened me.

1465
02:10:09,520 --> 02:10:11,670
I wanted to see you alone.

1466
02:10:11,760 --> 02:10:15,469
so I've been waiting and,
uh, walking about.

1467
02:10:21,240 --> 02:10:24,710
I don't wish to trouble you
as I did in Rome.

1468
02:10:24,800 --> 02:10:27,439
That was no use.
It only distressed you.

1469
02:10:27,520 --> 02:10:30,353
I knew I was wrong.

1470
02:10:30,440 --> 02:10:32,317
But I'm not wrong now.

1471
02:10:32,400 --> 02:10:35,392
It's very different now.
I can help you.

1472
02:10:35,480 --> 02:10:37,789
How can you help me?

1473
02:10:39,960 --> 02:10:43,270
It was good when you made me
come away with your cousin.

1474
02:10:43,360 --> 02:10:46,352
He was a good man. A fine man.

1475
02:10:48,240 --> 02:10:50,595
He told me how the case
stands for you.

1476
02:10:50,680 --> 02:10:52,910
He explained everything.

1477
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:55,230
He guessed my sentiments.

1478
02:11:03,680 --> 02:11:07,468
Do you know what he told me here
the last time I saw him?

1479
02:11:07,560 --> 02:11:10,313
He said,
"Do everything you can for her."

1480
02:11:12,080 --> 02:11:14,116
"Everything she'll let you."

1481
02:11:16,600 --> 02:11:18,909
You had no business to talk of me.

1482
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:20,558
Why not?

1483
02:11:20,640 --> 02:11:24,030
Why not, when we talked
in that way? He was dying.

1484
02:11:30,360 --> 02:11:33,318
It's too late to play a part.

1485
02:11:34,400 --> 02:11:37,870
Touchett knew and I knew
what it cost you to come here.

1486
02:11:37,960 --> 02:11:41,157
It will cost you your life.

1487
02:11:41,240 --> 02:11:44,038
Give me one word of truth.

1488
02:11:44,120 --> 02:11:46,076
You're afraid to go back.

1489
02:11:49,520 --> 02:11:52,239
You're perfectly alone.

1490
02:11:52,320 --> 02:11:54,515
Now I want you to think of me.

1491
02:11:56,440 --> 02:11:59,079
- To think of you.
- Turn to me.

1492
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:01,638
Why should you go back?

1493
02:12:01,720 --> 02:12:03,995
Why go through that ghastly form?

1494
02:12:04,080 --> 02:12:06,878
- To get away from you.
- I want to prevent that!

1495
02:12:13,280 --> 02:12:17,034
If you'd only for once listen to me.

1496
02:12:17,120 --> 02:12:19,076
Why shouldn't we be happy?

1497
02:12:19,240 --> 02:12:24,360
Why? Why, when it's here
before us? When it's so easy?

1498
02:12:24,440 --> 02:12:26,715
We can do absolutely as we please.

1499
02:12:26,800 --> 02:12:30,190
To whom under the sun
do we owe anything?

1500
02:12:32,480 --> 02:12:34,710
I beg you to go away.

1501
02:12:36,880 --> 02:12:39,235
Don't say that, don't kill me.

1502
02:18:31,120 --> 02:18:34,100
