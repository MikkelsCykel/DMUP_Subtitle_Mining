1
00:01:49,659 --> 00:01:51,627
<i>In other parts of the world,</i>

2
00:01:51,728 --> 00:01:54,561
<i>young men leave home
and travel far and wide...</i>

3
00:01:54,664 --> 00:01:57,360
<i>in search of a promising future.</i>

4
00:01:57,467 --> 00:02:01,927
<i>Theirjourneys are often fueled
by dreams of triumphing over evil,</i>

5
00:02:02,038 --> 00:02:04,131
<i>finding a great love...</i>

6
00:02:04,241 --> 00:02:07,768
<i>or the hope of fortunes
easily made.</i>

7
00:02:07,878 --> 00:02:12,781
<i>Here in St. Cloud's, not even
the decision to get off
the train is easily made,</i>

8
00:02:12,883 --> 00:02:16,910
<i>for it requires an earlier,
more difficult decision...</i>

9
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:21,286
<i>add a child to your life
or leave one behind.</i>

10
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:25,225
<i>The only reason people journey here
is for the orphanage.</i>

11
00:02:25,328 --> 00:02:27,592
<i>- Good morning.
- We have an appointment.</i>

12
00:02:27,697 --> 00:02:30,325
Yes. Come in.
Welcome to St. Cloud's.

13
00:02:30,433 --> 00:02:32,901
We're going right upstairs
to see Dr. Larch.

14
00:02:33,003 --> 00:02:35,494
<i>I came as a physician
to the abandoned children...</i>

15
00:02:35,605 --> 00:02:38,836
<i>and unhappily pregnant women.</i>

16
00:02:38,942 --> 00:02:41,502
<i>I had hoped to become a hero.</i>

17
00:02:41,611 --> 00:02:45,069
<i>But in St. Cloud's,
there was no such position.</i>

18
00:02:45,181 --> 00:02:47,945
<i>In the lonely, sordid world
of lost children,</i>

19
00:02:48,051 --> 00:02:51,077
<i>there were no heroes
to be found.</i>

20
00:02:51,187 --> 00:02:53,621
<i>And so I became the caretaker
of many,</i>

21
00:02:53,723 --> 00:02:55,714
<i>father of none.</i>

22
00:02:55,825 --> 00:02:59,124
<i>Well, in a way,
there was one.</i>

23
00:02:59,229 --> 00:03:01,220
Here he is.

24
00:03:01,331 --> 00:03:03,959
<i>His name
was Homer Wells.</i>

25
00:03:04,067 --> 00:03:08,470
I named him after
the Greek writer.

26
00:03:08,571 --> 00:03:10,562
You know, Homer, of course?

27
00:03:12,509 --> 00:03:17,105
<i>And I made his name Wells
because I could tell he was...</i>

28
00:03:17,213 --> 00:03:19,875
very deep.

29
00:03:19,983 --> 00:03:21,951
<i>In truth,
Nurse Angela named him.</i>

30
00:03:22,052 --> 00:03:25,283
<i>Her father drilled wells, and she once
owned a cat named Homer.</i>

31
00:03:25,388 --> 00:03:27,652
Bye-bye, Homer.

32
00:03:32,429 --> 00:03:35,421
<i>- Good night,
you Princes of Maine,
- Can we see the doctor?</i>

33
00:03:35,532 --> 00:03:38,433
You Kings of New England.

34
00:03:38,535 --> 00:03:40,765
<i>- Good night.
- Doctor?</i>

35
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:44,169
Doctor?
There's something wrong with him.

36
00:03:44,274 --> 00:03:47,505
<i>- He never makes a sound.
- He didn't cry.</i>

37
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:51,102
<i>Orphan babies learn
there's no point in it.</i>

38
00:03:51,214 --> 00:03:54,513
Do you think we could have a look
at someone a little different?

39
00:04:01,057 --> 00:04:04,993
<i>Thus was Homer Wells returned.
He was too happy a baby.</i>

40
00:04:05,095 --> 00:04:07,620
<i>Bye, Homer.</i>

41
00:04:07,731 --> 00:04:12,464
<i>The second
family to adopt him had a gift
for getting sounds out of Homer.</i>

42
00:04:12,569 --> 00:04:14,969
<i>They beat him.</i>

43
00:04:15,071 --> 00:04:17,437
<i>He couldn't stop crying.</i>

44
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:20,998
Shh, shh.
Shh, shh, shh.

45
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:26,442
It's okay now.

46
00:04:26,549 --> 00:04:29,040
Nobody's gonna hurt you
anymore.

47
00:04:29,152 --> 00:04:33,179
<i>Here in St.
Cloud's, I try to consider with
each rule I make or break...</i>

48
00:04:33,289 --> 00:04:36,850
<i>that my first priority
is an orphan's future.</i>

49
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,361
<i>Twice adopted,
twice returned.</i>

50
00:04:40,463 --> 00:04:42,829
<i>It didn't bode well.</i>

51
00:04:46,803 --> 00:04:51,365
<i>And yet it was always clear to
me that he was a special boy.</i>

52
00:04:51,474 --> 00:04:54,739
<i>Near the angle of the rib. And...</i>

53
00:04:54,844 --> 00:04:57,244
<i>- It was with
Homer's future in mind...
- Homer?</i>

54
00:04:57,347 --> 00:05:01,647
<i>- That I began his tutorials.
- Lf you're going to stay at St. Cloud's,</i>

55
00:05:01,751 --> 00:05:03,810
I expect you to be of use.

56
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,684
<i>I admit
that our lessons were, in part,</i>

57
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:11,318
<i>- the simple expression
of a father's love.
- Homer.</i>

58
00:05:11,428 --> 00:05:14,192
<i>But in failing to
withhold love...</i>

59
00:05:14,297 --> 00:05:17,232
<i>and making the orphanage
his home,</i>

60
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:22,771
<i>had I created a true
and everlasting orphan?</i>

61
00:05:22,872 --> 00:05:26,035
- No!
- Keep breathing. You're gonna be okay.

62
00:05:26,142 --> 00:05:29,942
<i>And so my
excellent pupil learned to look
after abandoned children...</i>

63
00:05:30,046 --> 00:05:34,005
<i>- and to deliver unwanted babies.
- Relax!</i>

64
00:05:34,117 --> 00:05:37,678
<i>Long ago, I had decided
that sometimes...</i>

65
00:05:37,787 --> 00:05:40,688
<i>it was the women
who needed to be delivered.</i>

66
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:50,699
<i>I chose my own path.</i>

67
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,236
<i>No one would ever choose
for Homer Wells.</i>

68
00:06:07,417 --> 00:06:10,648
# I saw the splendor of the moonlight #

69
00:06:10,753 --> 00:06:15,622
# On Honolulu Bay #

70
00:06:15,725 --> 00:06:18,888
#There's something tender
in the moonlight #

71
00:06:18,995 --> 00:06:23,762
# On Honolulu Bay #

72
00:06:23,867 --> 00:06:28,497
<i>#And all the beaches
are full of peaches #</i>

73
00:06:28,605 --> 00:06:32,564
#Who bring their youth along #

74
00:06:32,675 --> 00:06:35,838
#And in the glimmer
of the moonlight #

75
00:06:35,945 --> 00:06:40,973
<i># They love to sing
this song #</i>

76
00:06:41,084 --> 00:06:46,989
<i>#If you like
the Ukulele Lady #</i>

77
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:51,959
<i>- # Ukulele Lady like you ##
- Dr. Larch!</i>

78
00:06:54,464 --> 00:06:57,024
Dr. Larch!

79
00:06:59,469 --> 00:07:02,029
<i>Dr. Larch?</i>

80
00:07:02,138 --> 00:07:04,436
We have two new patients.

81
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:06,975
- One to deliver.
- Coming.

82
00:07:08,912 --> 00:07:12,040
<i>- First pregnancy?
- Yes, for both.</i>

83
00:07:12,148 --> 00:07:15,447
I presume you'd prefer
handling the delivery?

84
00:07:15,552 --> 00:07:18,214
All I said was,
I don't wanna perform abortions.

85
00:07:18,321 --> 00:07:20,812
I have no argument
with you performing them.

86
00:07:20,924 --> 00:07:24,189
You know how to help these women.
How can you not feel obligated...

87
00:07:24,294 --> 00:07:26,888
to help them when they can't
get help anywhere else?

88
00:07:26,996 --> 00:07:31,365
One: It's illegal. Two: I didn't ask
how to do it. You just showed me.

89
00:07:31,467 --> 00:07:35,836
What else could I have shown
you, Homer? The only thing
I can teach you is what I know.

90
00:07:35,939 --> 00:07:39,705
In any life,
you have to be of use.

91
00:07:39,809 --> 00:07:42,039
Of use? Of use.

92
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:48,915
That was good, Carla. That was perfect.
Everything's gonna be fine.

93
00:07:49,018 --> 00:07:52,852
- I don't wanna see it.
- You don't have to see it, dear.
Don't worry.

94
00:07:52,956 --> 00:07:56,687
I don't even wanna know
what sex it is, so don't tell me!

95
00:07:56,793 --> 00:08:00,593
- We won't tell you.
You're gonna be okay.
- Your baby's gonna be okay too.

96
00:08:00,697 --> 00:08:03,757
- I don't wanna know!
- That's a big boy.

97
00:08:03,866 --> 00:08:06,699
Let me see him.

98
00:08:06,803 --> 00:08:08,862
I wanna see him.

99
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:13,202
- Would you mind joining me
in the nursery?
- Okay.

100
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,215
Wilbur, the adopting couple
is waiting in your office.

101
00:08:20,316 --> 00:08:24,343
Life is waiting.
Let 'em wait.

102
00:08:24,454 --> 00:08:26,422
Where's the name sheet?

103
00:08:26,522 --> 00:08:28,854
Uh, nobody's named
this one yet.

104
00:08:28,958 --> 00:08:34,760
Oh, it's my turn. Henceforth,
you shall be Little Dorrit.

105
00:08:34,864 --> 00:08:37,196
<i>Oh.</i>

106
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:39,598
<i>No, you don't like that,
do you?</i>

107
00:08:39,702 --> 00:08:42,193
He's a boy, that's why.

108
00:08:42,305 --> 00:08:44,535
Can't a boy be a Dorrit?

109
00:08:44,641 --> 00:08:47,474
- I don't think so.
- You do it.

110
00:08:47,577 --> 00:08:49,909
Okay.

111
00:08:50,013 --> 00:08:53,449
Henceforth,
you shall be Little Wilbur.

112
00:08:56,686 --> 00:08:58,654
I'm not crazy about
the "Little."

113
00:08:58,755 --> 00:09:01,883
Okay, just Wilbur then.

114
00:09:01,991 --> 00:09:06,758
We haven't had a Wilbur in a year or so,
have we? We used to have dozens.

115
00:09:07,063 --> 00:09:09,463
He sniffs that ether.
I've seen him do it.

116
00:09:09,565 --> 00:09:12,329
It's because he's too tired
to sleep. He has to.

117
00:09:12,435 --> 00:09:14,460
He smells like he could
put you to sleep.

118
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:17,334
He's a doctor, Buster.
Doctors smell like ether.

119
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,068
- You're a doctor, Homer.
You don't smell like ether.
- I'm not a doctor.

120
00:09:20,176 --> 00:09:23,441
I haven't been to medical school.
I haven't even been to high school.

121
00:09:23,546 --> 00:09:28,142
- But you've studied
with the old man for years.
- I'm not a doctor.

122
00:09:29,285 --> 00:09:31,185
I'm sorry, Homer.

123
00:09:31,287 --> 00:09:33,118
<i>#I saw the splendor

125
00:09:36,592 --> 00:09:38,651
<i>Fuzzy is not uncommon.</i>

126
00:09:38,761 --> 00:09:43,824
There's something about the premature
babies of alcoholic mothers.

127
00:09:43,933 --> 00:09:46,925
They seem to be susceptible to every
damn thing that comes along.

128
00:09:47,036 --> 00:09:49,800
<i>I haven't read that.</i>

129
00:09:49,906 --> 00:09:52,932
I haven't either,
but you will.

130
00:09:53,042 --> 00:09:56,478
Those morons who write the books
ought to do some research here.

131
00:09:56,579 --> 00:09:59,104
Isn't Fuzzy just
underdeveloped?

132
00:09:59,215 --> 00:10:01,376
<i>When doesn't
he have bronchitis?</i>

133
00:10:01,484 --> 00:10:05,784
I wouldn't call his bronchial
infection underdeveloped, would you?

134
00:10:05,888 --> 00:10:08,652
Come on, Fuzz.

135
00:10:08,758 --> 00:10:11,955
Here we go. Feet up.

136
00:10:12,061 --> 00:10:14,291
There you are.

137
00:10:14,397 --> 00:10:17,161
<i>- What's going on here?
- Sit up straight.</i>

138
00:10:19,635 --> 00:10:23,969
<i>- Wilbur? Wilbur, can you
come out here, please?</i>

139
00:10:24,073 --> 00:10:27,167
There you go.

140
00:10:27,276 --> 00:10:30,973
- Hi, Homer.
- Hey. What is it, Mary Agnes?

141
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:34,914
<i>Now calm down.</i>

142
00:10:35,017 --> 00:10:38,919
- What is it?
- Look.

143
00:10:39,021 --> 00:10:42,218
Oh. Uh, did you bite it?

144
00:10:44,026 --> 00:10:46,859
- Did you bite your tongue?
- I don't remember.

145
00:10:48,598 --> 00:10:52,898
Uh, yeah. That looks like you bit it.
You'll be fine.

146
00:10:53,002 --> 00:10:57,063
Well, maybe I was kissing
someone and he bit me.

147
00:10:57,173 --> 00:11:00,267
Oh, I think you bit it. Maybe
in your sleep. Story time, Fuzzy.

148
00:11:00,376 --> 00:11:04,335
O Lord, support us
all the day long...

149
00:11:04,447 --> 00:11:08,543
until the shadows lengthen
and the evening comes...

150
00:11:08,651 --> 00:11:13,350
and the busy world is hushed
and the fever of life is over...

151
00:11:13,456 --> 00:11:15,424
and our work is done.

152
00:11:15,525 --> 00:11:17,516
<i>Then in Thy mercy,</i>

153
00:11:17,627 --> 00:11:22,223
<i>- grant us a safe lodging
and a holy rest...</i>

154
00:11:22,331 --> 00:11:24,299
And peace at the last.

155
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:27,858
- Amen.
- Amen.

156
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:30,029
<i>"A dog, which had lain
concealed till now...</i>

157
00:11:30,139 --> 00:11:32,937
<i>"ran backwards and forwards
on the parapet...</i>

158
00:11:33,042 --> 00:11:35,203
"with a dismal howl.

159
00:11:35,311 --> 00:11:37,472
"And collecting himself
for a spring,

160
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:40,947
"jumped for
the dead man's shoulders.

161
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:43,610
"Missing his aim,
he fell into a ditch...

162
00:11:43,719 --> 00:11:46,483
"turning completely over
as he went...

163
00:11:46,589 --> 00:11:48,750
<i>"and striking his head
against the stone,</i>

164
00:11:48,858 --> 00:11:51,622
dashed out his brains."

165
00:11:51,727 --> 00:11:53,752
<i>And that...</i>

166
00:11:53,863 --> 00:11:55,831
<i>Is the end of the chapter.</i>

167
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:03,565
That's it till tomorrow.

168
00:12:09,745 --> 00:12:13,078
Good night,
you Princes of Maine,

169
00:12:13,182 --> 00:12:15,150
you Kings of New England.

170
00:12:18,421 --> 00:12:21,515
<i>Good night,
Princes of Maine, Kings of New England.</i>

171
00:12:21,624 --> 00:12:23,615
Whoa.

172
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:28,093
John, you all right?

173
00:12:28,197 --> 00:12:31,428
Why does Dr. Larch
say that every night?

174
00:12:33,102 --> 00:12:36,594
- Maybe to scare us.
- No, you jerk.

175
00:12:36,706 --> 00:12:39,368
Dr. Larch loves us.

176
00:12:39,475 --> 00:12:42,137
But why does he do that?

177
00:12:42,245 --> 00:12:46,545
<i>- Does it because we like it.
- Do you like it, Curly?</i>

178
00:12:47,717 --> 00:12:49,810
Yeah.

179
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:52,479
I like it too.

180
00:12:52,889 --> 00:12:55,687
Watch the door.

181
00:12:55,791 --> 00:12:58,385
You two get Copperfield
and Curly. Buster's mine.

182
00:12:58,494 --> 00:13:01,622
- And remember, nobody touches Fuzzy.
- Attack!

183
00:13:01,731 --> 00:13:05,132
Hey!

184
00:13:14,143 --> 00:13:16,373
- Ow!
- Ouch.

185
00:13:26,422 --> 00:13:29,255
What do you think
you're doing?

186
00:13:29,358 --> 00:13:33,727
Children, stop it. No fighting.
Share the snowballs.

187
00:13:39,268 --> 00:13:41,236
Fuzzy. Fuzzy.

188
00:13:41,337 --> 00:13:43,703
Listen to you.
You've been running.

189
00:13:55,351 --> 00:13:57,876
Hey, over here!
Look! Pick me!

190
00:14:05,962 --> 00:14:09,363
<i>I know the type.
They'll take one of the babies.</i>

191
00:14:17,506 --> 00:14:19,474
Mary Agnes.

192
00:14:22,011 --> 00:14:26,209
Come here.
Don't run.

193
00:14:26,315 --> 00:14:28,374
<i>Fuzzy.</i>

194
00:14:28,484 --> 00:14:30,577
Curly.

195
00:14:37,326 --> 00:14:40,295
<i>John.</i>

196
00:14:42,498 --> 00:14:44,466
<i>Hazel.</i>

197
00:14:46,869 --> 00:14:48,962
Andy.

198
00:15:14,296 --> 00:15:17,424
They wanted a girl,
Curly.

199
00:15:17,533 --> 00:15:20,024
Nobody ever wants me.

200
00:15:20,136 --> 00:15:24,038
Oh, hey.
Hey, come on.

201
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:26,131
Come here.

202
00:15:26,242 --> 00:15:29,143
You know, you're one
of the best, Curly.

203
00:15:29,245 --> 00:15:31,475
And we wouldn't let
just anyone take you.

204
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:35,175
Dr. Larch wouldn't let
just anyone take any of us.

205
00:15:35,284 --> 00:15:37,275
Well, that's true.

206
00:15:37,386 --> 00:15:41,447
- Nobody's asked for me, have they?
- Nobody special enough, Curly.

207
00:15:41,557 --> 00:15:43,821
You mean somebody has?

208
00:15:43,926 --> 00:15:46,861
Only the right people
can have you.

209
00:15:46,962 --> 00:15:49,624
Now what do you say
we go unpack your suitcase?

210
00:15:49,732 --> 00:15:52,667
- It's movie night tonight, Curly.
- Okay.

211
00:16:22,465 --> 00:16:24,933
<i>Look. Kong thinks
she's his mother.</i>

212
00:16:25,034 --> 00:16:27,559
<i>- His mother?
- He thinks she's his mother.</i>

213
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:32,198
- He doesn't think
she's his mother, Fuzzy.
- He does so. He loves her.

214
00:16:32,308 --> 00:16:35,436
<i>- That's why he holds her.
- Shh, Fuzzy.</i>

215
00:16:38,614 --> 00:16:43,074
<i>Fuzzy, how can she
be his mother?</i>

216
00:16:43,185 --> 00:16:45,915
He just thinks she is.

217
00:16:50,292 --> 00:16:52,453
They want to replace me.

218
00:16:52,561 --> 00:16:55,257
The board of trustees
wants to replace me.

219
00:16:55,364 --> 00:16:57,594
They just want you
to hire some new help.

220
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:00,931
We don't need any more help.
Some new things would be useful.

221
00:17:01,036 --> 00:17:03,436
<i>Yuck!</i>

222
00:17:03,539 --> 00:17:06,770
<i>Aw, come on.</i>

223
00:17:06,876 --> 00:17:10,778
- Homer, I need you.
- Happens every time.

224
00:17:12,982 --> 00:17:15,314
Kong, Kong, Kong,
Kong, Kong, Kong!

225
00:17:15,417 --> 00:17:19,319
Thought you'd taken care of this.
Always breaks in the same place.

226
00:17:19,421 --> 00:17:24,256
- It's your splice, isn't it?
- No, it is your splice.
You blame me for everything.

227
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:28,228
Angela, we need a new movie,
a new projector, a new typewriter.

228
00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:30,298
That's what needs replacing
around here.

229
00:17:30,399 --> 00:17:33,596
- Wilbur, we have a delivery.
- Homer, would you get this one?

230
00:17:33,702 --> 00:17:37,263
She's a patient, right?
She should see a doctor.

231
00:17:37,373 --> 00:17:41,104
Homer, you are a skilled
and gifted surgeon...

232
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:44,941
with near perfect obstetrical
and gynecological procedure.

233
00:17:45,047 --> 00:17:48,949
I just mean that I'd rather
fix the movie tonight.

234
00:17:50,085 --> 00:17:52,610
Okay, sure.

235
00:17:52,721 --> 00:17:55,087
You splice,
I'll deliver.

236
00:18:02,898 --> 00:18:06,766
Come on, Fuzz.
Let's go. Let go. Come on.

237
00:18:06,869 --> 00:18:09,770
Homer, doesn't King Kong
think the woman is his mother?

238
00:18:09,872 --> 00:18:13,968
- That's right, Fuzz.
That's what Kong thinks.
- That's why Kong loves her.

239
00:18:14,076 --> 00:18:16,544
<i>It's your turn.
I'll get this.</i>

240
00:18:16,645 --> 00:18:20,172
Okay.
Story time!

241
00:18:24,653 --> 00:18:27,884
The Personal History
of David Copperfield.

242
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:31,391
Chapter one.
"I am born."

243
00:18:31,493 --> 00:18:35,361
"Whether I shall turn out to be
the hero of my own life...

244
00:18:35,464 --> 00:18:40,561
"or whether that station will be held
by anybody else, these pages must show.

245
00:18:40,669 --> 00:18:43,467
<i>"I was a posthumous child.</i>

246
00:18:43,572 --> 00:18:46,905
<i>- "My father's eyes had closed
upon the light of this world...</i>

247
00:18:47,009 --> 00:18:50,536
Six months
when mine opened on it."

248
00:18:50,646 --> 00:18:53,342
His father's dead, right?

249
00:18:53,449 --> 00:18:55,849
That's right, Fuzz.

250
00:18:55,951 --> 00:18:57,976
<i>Is your father dead?</i>

251
00:18:58,087 --> 00:19:01,420
Cirrhosis.
It's a disease of the liver.

252
00:19:03,092 --> 00:19:05,219
What, a liver killed him?

253
00:19:05,327 --> 00:19:09,661
<i>No, alcohol killed him.
He drank himself to death.</i>

254
00:19:09,765 --> 00:19:12,734
- But did you know him?
- Barely.

255
00:19:12,835 --> 00:19:15,736
But it hardly mattered
that I knew him.

256
00:19:15,838 --> 00:19:18,329
- Did you know your mother better?
- Mm-hmm.

257
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:22,399
She's dead now too.
She was a nanny.

258
00:19:22,511 --> 00:19:24,502
<i>What's a nanny do?</i>

259
00:19:24,613 --> 00:19:27,013
She looks after
other people's children.

260
00:19:28,317 --> 00:19:30,683
- Did she grow up around here?
- No.

261
00:19:30,786 --> 00:19:34,916
- She was an immigrant.
- What's an immigrant?

262
00:19:36,191 --> 00:19:38,182
Someone not from Maine.

263
00:19:42,464 --> 00:19:44,898
Let us be happy for Hazel.

264
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,299
Hazel has found a family.
Good night, Hazel.

265
00:19:48,404 --> 00:19:50,736
<i>Good night, Hazel.</i>

266
00:20:28,277 --> 00:20:33,180
I was dreaming about you.
How beautiful you were.

267
00:20:33,282 --> 00:20:35,750
- Ah, you weren't.
- I was.

268
00:20:35,851 --> 00:20:38,684
- And I was beautiful?
- You were.

269
00:20:38,787 --> 00:20:41,153
You are.

270
00:20:41,256 --> 00:20:43,451
It was fantastic.

271
00:20:46,228 --> 00:20:48,662
It was just the ether,
Wilbur.

272
00:21:01,577 --> 00:21:05,809
- Hi.
- Hey, Eddie, look at this.

273
00:21:05,914 --> 00:21:11,477
- Homer, do you ever think about
trying to find your parents?
- Not really.

274
00:21:11,587 --> 00:21:13,555
Why not?

275
00:21:13,655 --> 00:21:17,022
<i>Well, they never did the things
parents are supposed to do.</i>

276
00:21:17,126 --> 00:21:21,961
Dr. Larch did those things
and Nurse Edna and Nurse Angela.

277
00:21:22,064 --> 00:21:25,727
Well, I wish I could
meet mine anyway, sometimes.

278
00:21:26,902 --> 00:21:29,029
What for?

279
00:21:31,006 --> 00:21:35,807
Well, I'd like to show 'em
that I could cook a little.

280
00:21:35,911 --> 00:21:38,539
<i>- Mm-hmm.
- And...</i>

281
00:21:38,647 --> 00:21:40,706
that I could drive a truck.

282
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:44,009
Mm-hmm.

283
00:21:46,321 --> 00:21:51,224
Sometimes I wanna meet them so I can
kill them. Just sort of kill them.

284
00:22:00,335 --> 00:22:03,168
You know I'd never
kill anyone, right?

285
00:22:03,272 --> 00:22:05,433
<i>- Mm-hmm. I know.
- Get away!</i>

286
00:22:05,541 --> 00:22:08,032
Get the hell off of me!

287
00:22:08,143 --> 00:22:10,577
I think Mary Agnes
could kill someone.

288
00:22:10,679 --> 00:22:13,842
<i>- What the hell do you
think you're doing?
- I don't think so.</i>

289
00:22:13,949 --> 00:22:17,510
No, she's... she's just
an emotional girl.

290
00:22:17,619 --> 00:22:19,917
<i>What's she so emotional about?</i>

291
00:22:20,022 --> 00:22:23,753
She got left here
like the rest of us, didn't she?

292
00:22:31,533 --> 00:22:34,093
Throw it to Copperfield.

293
00:22:34,203 --> 00:22:36,296
I go first.

294
00:22:36,405 --> 00:22:39,033
I'll be on Buster's team.

295
00:22:43,512 --> 00:22:45,810
Look!

296
00:22:45,914 --> 00:22:47,973
<i>Her temperature is 104.</i>

297
00:22:48,083 --> 00:22:50,745
Scoot down.

298
00:22:50,853 --> 00:22:54,448
Come on. Good girl.
That's a girl. Little more.

299
00:22:54,556 --> 00:22:58,322
Dear child, it won't hurt when I look.
I'm just gonna look.

300
00:22:58,427 --> 00:23:00,918
All right.

301
00:23:09,438 --> 00:23:12,066
Dear child, did you, uh,
do something to yourself?

302
00:23:12,174 --> 00:23:14,904
It wasn't me.
It wasn't me.

303
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:17,478
- Did you go to someone else?
- He said he was a doctor.

304
00:23:17,579 --> 00:23:22,607
- I would never have stuck that
inside of me. It wasn't me.
- Listen, you've been very brave.

305
00:23:22,718 --> 00:23:25,084
<i>- I'm going to put you to sleep.
- It wasn't me.</i>

306
00:23:25,187 --> 00:23:28,452
Homer, I want you
to see this.

307
00:23:28,557 --> 00:23:31,583
You won't feel it any more.

308
00:23:33,729 --> 00:23:38,632
You've been very brave.
We'll make it deep.

309
00:23:38,734 --> 00:23:40,793
- You sure?
- You bet.

310
00:23:40,903 --> 00:23:45,272
The fetus is unexpelled.
Her uterus is punctured.

311
00:23:45,374 --> 00:23:50,710
<i>She has acute peritonitis,
and there's a foreign object.</i>

312
00:23:50,812 --> 00:23:52,871
<i>I think it's a crochet hook.</i>

313
00:23:56,118 --> 00:23:59,849
Take this.

314
00:23:59,955 --> 00:24:03,789
If she had come to you four months ago
and asked for a simple D&C,

315
00:24:03,892 --> 00:24:05,860
what would you have done?

316
00:24:05,961 --> 00:24:10,694
Nothing!
This is what doing nothing gets you.

317
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:15,133
It means that somebody else
is gonna do the job, some moron
who doesn't know how.

318
00:24:18,974 --> 00:24:21,534
I wish you'd have
come to me, dear child.

319
00:24:35,257 --> 00:24:37,384
What did she die of?

320
00:24:37,492 --> 00:24:39,653
She died of secrecy.

321
00:24:39,761 --> 00:24:44,528
- She died of ignorance.
- Oh.

322
00:24:44,633 --> 00:24:48,364
Homer, if you expect people to be
responsible for their children,

323
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:53,032
you have to give them the right to
decide whether or not to have children.

324
00:24:53,141 --> 00:24:56,406
- Wouldn't you agree?
- How about expecting people
to be responsible enough...

325
00:24:56,511 --> 00:24:58,604
to control themselves
to begin with?

326
00:24:58,714 --> 00:25:02,081
How about this child?
You expect her to be responsible?

327
00:25:02,184 --> 00:25:05,119
I'm not talking about her.

328
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:08,280
I'm talking about adults.

329
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:10,551
You know who I mean.

330
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:18,561
- What?
- It's just... It's just a marvel to me...

331
00:25:18,667 --> 00:25:22,899
that you still have such
high expectations of people.

332
00:25:23,005 --> 00:25:26,805
- I'm happy I amuse you.
- Look at it this way.

333
00:25:26,908 --> 00:25:30,742
What choice does Buster have?
What are his options?

334
00:25:30,846 --> 00:25:34,043
<i>- Nobody will ever adopt him.
- Look at it this way.</i>

335
00:25:34,149 --> 00:25:38,984
Buster and I are sitting here
right beside you. We could have
ended up in the incinerator.

336
00:25:39,087 --> 00:25:43,990
<i>Happy to be alive under any
circumstances. Is that your point?</i>

337
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:54,660
Happy to be alive?
Yeah, I guess so.

338
00:26:10,185 --> 00:26:14,952
- You're it.
- Pass it over here.

339
00:26:15,057 --> 00:26:19,517
- So many children.
Are they all orphans?
- Well, it is an orphanage.

340
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:23,660
- Who wants chocolate?
- I want some chocolate.

341
00:26:23,765 --> 00:26:26,199
Hi. Okay.

342
00:26:26,301 --> 00:26:29,759
<i>They're getting in the car.
Watch your fingers.</i>

343
00:26:29,871 --> 00:26:31,998
Hi.

344
00:26:32,107 --> 00:26:34,371
<i>- Hi.
- Hi.</i>

345
00:26:34,476 --> 00:26:37,343
- I'm the best.
- You are?

346
00:26:37,446 --> 00:26:40,176
Wow! The best?
The best at what?

347
00:26:40,282 --> 00:26:44,184
<i>- I'm the best one.
- The best one, huh?</i>

348
00:26:44,286 --> 00:26:46,686
- I'm the best one of all the kids.
- You are?

349
00:26:46,788 --> 00:26:48,847
He seems like
the best one.

350
00:26:55,597 --> 00:26:59,533
Well, let's see if we can take care
of that. Can you blow?

351
00:26:59,634 --> 00:27:02,228
I really am the best.
I just have a cold.

352
00:27:02,337 --> 00:27:05,898
Sorry. They're not used
to seeing a car like this.

353
00:27:06,007 --> 00:27:07,235
Ah, it's okay.
I don't mind.

354
00:27:07,342 --> 00:27:09,333
<i>Come on.</i>

355
00:27:09,444 --> 00:27:11,969
Come on. Let's get out.
Come on now.

356
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,514
<i>- Oh, sure you can. Come on.
- Good morning.</i>

357
00:27:16,518 --> 00:27:18,509
- Morning.
- Dr. Larch.

358
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:22,386
<i>- Candy.
- Hi, I'm Wally. I brought
some chocolates for the kids.</i>

359
00:27:22,491 --> 00:27:26,188
Chocolates? How thoughtful.
Come on, Curly.

360
00:27:30,165 --> 00:27:33,225
<i>- So, Mrs...
- Candy.</i>

361
00:27:33,335 --> 00:27:35,496
Candy Kendall.

362
00:27:35,604 --> 00:27:38,198
Wally. Wally Worthington.

363
00:27:49,217 --> 00:27:51,515
How many months are you?

364
00:27:57,025 --> 00:28:01,223
- Uh, two.
- Two.

365
00:28:04,733 --> 00:28:07,293
Um...

366
00:28:07,402 --> 00:28:11,099
Are you... Are you the...
Are you doing the...

367
00:28:11,206 --> 00:28:14,198
Oh, no. Dr. Larch will be
performing the procedure.

368
00:28:14,309 --> 00:28:16,743
- Oh, good.
- Okay.

369
00:28:16,845 --> 00:28:19,939
I was...
I was just curious.

370
00:28:20,048 --> 00:28:22,608
<i>Excuse me.</i>

371
00:28:22,717 --> 00:28:25,584
The woman you delivered last night,
she's complaining of pain.

372
00:28:25,687 --> 00:28:29,123
Okay. I'll take a look.
Couple of minutes. Thank you.

373
00:28:40,902 --> 00:28:42,893
<i>Are you okay?</i>

374
00:28:43,004 --> 00:28:46,735
Yeah. I think
it was the ether.

375
00:28:46,842 --> 00:28:50,471
Oh, the... That smell
must've got to me.

376
00:28:52,247 --> 00:28:55,842
Oh, God,
this is all my fault.

377
00:28:55,951 --> 00:28:59,409
<i>Homer, Steerforth got into the pantry.
He's eaten all the pie dough.</i>

378
00:28:59,521 --> 00:29:02,922
<i>- He wasn't sharing it either.
- He's down the hall throwing up.</i>

379
00:29:03,024 --> 00:29:06,516
<i>- He's such a pig.
- Don't call him a pig. It's
not nice to call people names.</i>

380
00:29:06,628 --> 00:29:09,028
<i>But he is a pig.</i>

381
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:14,762
What kind of planes
do you fly in?

382
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:16,838
<i>A B- 24 Liberator.</i>

383
00:29:16,938 --> 00:29:20,965
<i>Oh. Liberator.</i>

384
00:29:21,076 --> 00:29:24,273
You enlisted?

385
00:29:24,379 --> 00:29:27,871
They wouldn't take me. I'm Class 4.
I have a heart defect.

386
00:29:27,983 --> 00:29:30,474
<i>- Yeah? Is it serious?
- No.</i>

387
00:29:30,585 --> 00:29:34,521
No, it's not serious.
I'm just not supposed to get excited.

388
00:29:34,623 --> 00:29:37,683
You know, no strain, no stress.
I try to keep calm all the time.

389
00:29:37,792 --> 00:29:41,558
I can't imagine there's
any strain or stress around here.

390
00:29:41,663 --> 00:29:44,461
<i>Yeah.</i>

391
00:29:49,738 --> 00:29:52,366
- How she's doing?
- Just fine.

392
00:29:52,474 --> 00:29:54,806
Good.

393
00:29:56,578 --> 00:29:58,739
Boy or a girl?

394
00:29:58,847 --> 00:30:01,509
- It's all over, dear.
- Yeah, it's all over, honey.

395
00:30:07,022 --> 00:30:11,391
<i>I would really like
to have a baby one day.</i>

396
00:30:11,493 --> 00:30:13,518
<i>- I really would.
- Why, of course.</i>

397
00:30:13,628 --> 00:30:16,358
You can have as
many children as you want.

398
00:30:16,464 --> 00:30:21,595
- I'm sure you'll have
very beautiful children.
- Oh, yes, I'm sure. I'm sure.

399
00:30:24,039 --> 00:30:28,373
You'll have Princes of Maine.
You'll have Kings of New England.

400
00:30:30,779 --> 00:30:34,237
Lieutenant, I think you should
find yourself some fresh air.

401
00:30:46,828 --> 00:30:49,888
<i>- I still don't feel so good.
- Cut it out, children.</i>

402
00:30:49,998 --> 00:30:52,796
Homer, what's a runt?
Copperfield called me a runt.

403
00:30:52,901 --> 00:30:55,096
<i>He was just kidding, Fuzz.</i>

404
00:30:55,203 --> 00:30:57,899
<i>- Here.
- Orange is my favorite color.</i>

405
00:30:58,006 --> 00:31:00,907
<i>Should I keep
the teeth orange?</i>

406
00:31:01,009 --> 00:31:02,909
<i>Homer, look.</i>

407
00:31:03,011 --> 00:31:05,809
<i>Homer, look, look.</i>

408
00:31:07,148 --> 00:31:09,912
Homer, when is Halloween?

409
00:31:10,018 --> 00:31:12,714
- It's at the end of October.
- Is that soon?

410
00:31:12,821 --> 00:31:15,984
<i>That's a few months away, Fuzz.</i>

411
00:31:16,091 --> 00:31:20,494
<i>Oh, it's the best time.
Homer?</i>

412
00:31:20,595 --> 00:31:24,326
- What is Honolulu?
- Honolulu?

413
00:31:24,432 --> 00:31:26,957
Hmm. It's a city.

414
00:31:27,068 --> 00:31:30,435
Oh. What's the moonlight like?

415
00:31:32,374 --> 00:31:34,569
Well, I've never been there,

416
00:31:34,676 --> 00:31:38,908
<i>- but I think that it would
probably be very bright.
- Oh.</i>

417
00:31:39,014 --> 00:31:41,482
Why do we get pumpkins
only once a year?

418
00:31:44,419 --> 00:31:46,979
Don't get too excited,
Fuzzy.

419
00:31:54,095 --> 00:31:57,929
<i>Eeew, that's disgusting!
He does this all the time.</i>

420
00:31:58,033 --> 00:32:00,160
<i>Stop it right now.</i>

421
00:32:30,231 --> 00:32:33,689
- Hey.
- Hey. How's she doin'?

422
00:32:33,802 --> 00:32:36,327
- Oh, she's fine.
- Good.

423
00:32:38,406 --> 00:32:40,374
Fine.

424
00:32:43,845 --> 00:32:48,305
L... I was wondering
if you could give me a ride?

425
00:32:48,416 --> 00:32:50,543
Sure.

426
00:32:50,652 --> 00:32:54,383
I'd be glad to.
Uh, a ride where?

427
00:32:54,489 --> 00:32:56,252
Where you goin'?

428
00:32:56,357 --> 00:32:58,917
We're headin' back
to Cape Kenneth.

429
00:32:59,027 --> 00:33:03,157
Cape Kenneth?
That sounds fine.

430
00:33:04,499 --> 00:33:06,694
Okay.

431
00:33:18,646 --> 00:33:21,706
Doubtless you will let me know
what immensely worthwhile...

432
00:33:21,816 --> 00:33:25,411
or at least useful thing
that it is you find to do.

433
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:28,284
I wasn't intending to leave here
to be entirely useless.

434
00:33:28,389 --> 00:33:32,189
I expect I'll find some
other way to be of use.

435
00:33:32,293 --> 00:33:36,423
- In other parts of the world,
I suppose there are other ways.
- Of course.

436
00:33:36,531 --> 00:33:40,763
Are you so stupid you imagine you're
going to find a more gratifying life?

437
00:33:40,869 --> 00:33:43,804
What you will find is people
like the poor people who get left here.

438
00:33:43,905 --> 00:33:48,638
Only nobody takes care of them
half as well. You won't be able
to take care of them either.

439
00:33:48,743 --> 00:33:53,612
There's no taking care
of anybody, not out there.

440
00:33:53,715 --> 00:33:57,549
You know I'm grateful for everything
that you've done for me.

441
00:33:57,652 --> 00:34:02,112
- I don't need your gratitude.
- I don't need this.
I know all about my condition.

442
00:34:02,223 --> 00:34:06,125
It's your heart.
You ought to take it with you.

443
00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:19,135
Going where?
Does he have a plan of some kind?

444
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:22,937
- Will he be back soon?
- I don't know. He's just leaving.

445
00:34:23,044 --> 00:34:25,979
You were the one who says
he needs to see the world.

446
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:29,481
- That's what he'll do, is see the world.
- He's leaving.

447
00:34:29,584 --> 00:34:34,351
<i>- He'll need clothes.
He'll need some money.
- Let him try to make some money.</i>

448
00:34:34,455 --> 00:34:36,787
That's part of seeing
the world, isn't it?

449
00:34:36,891 --> 00:34:40,349
Oh, Wilbur, stop it. You knew this was
going to happen. He's a young man.

450
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:44,828
He's still a boy.

451
00:34:44,933 --> 00:34:48,494
Out in the world,

452
00:34:48,603 --> 00:34:51,003
he's still a boy.

453
00:34:51,105 --> 00:34:55,166
Just find him some clothes,
Wilbur.

454
00:34:55,276 --> 00:34:57,870
He could use some clothes.

455
00:35:24,138 --> 00:35:27,232
<i>Homer.</i>

456
00:35:27,342 --> 00:35:30,800
<i>Copperfield.
It'll be all right.</i>

457
00:35:30,912 --> 00:35:35,872
Children,
up on the porch. Up, up.

458
00:35:35,984 --> 00:35:39,215
<i>Say goodbye.
Wave from here.</i>

459
00:35:44,259 --> 00:35:46,318
- Bye. Bye.
- Bye, Homer.

460
00:35:54,535 --> 00:35:56,867
<i>Bye, Homer.</i>

461
00:35:58,706 --> 00:36:00,697
<i>Come on.</i>

462
00:36:19,394 --> 00:36:22,693
- I can walk. Put me down.
- Nope. I wanna carry you.

463
00:36:22,797 --> 00:36:26,893
- No, it's okay.
- Here, let me get this.

464
00:36:27,001 --> 00:36:29,970
Wally, put me down.

465
00:36:30,071 --> 00:36:32,539
Okay. Okay.

466
00:36:33,841 --> 00:36:36,366
Hey.

467
00:36:36,477 --> 00:36:40,140
Coming with us?
That's good.

468
00:36:40,248 --> 00:36:42,739
You never know when
you're gonna need a doctor.

469
00:36:42,850 --> 00:36:45,410
- Do you want me to put the top up?
- No.

470
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:48,546
- You might get cold.
- I want some fresh air.

471
00:36:56,331 --> 00:36:58,595
<i>She'll be just fine.</i>

472
00:37:02,937 --> 00:37:05,633
Is he gonna come out?

473
00:37:14,716 --> 00:37:18,516
- Bye, Homer.
- Bye, Curly.

474
00:37:18,619 --> 00:37:21,520
Sorry I have to go.

475
00:37:21,622 --> 00:37:25,285
It's not fair.
You're too old.

476
00:37:32,734 --> 00:37:37,194
I couldn't find Buster.
Maybe you could tell him that l...

477
00:37:49,083 --> 00:37:52,541
- Bye, Homer!
- Don't go too far!

478
00:37:52,653 --> 00:37:54,951
Homer, bye!

479
00:37:56,557 --> 00:37:58,650
Hey, Homer!

480
00:38:32,527 --> 00:38:34,825
<i>Let us be happy
for Homer Wells.</i>

481
00:38:34,929 --> 00:38:37,864
Homer has found a family.

482
00:38:37,965 --> 00:38:40,399
Aren't we all happy
for Homer?

483
00:38:40,501 --> 00:38:44,528
- Yes.
- Good night, Homer.

484
00:38:44,639 --> 00:38:46,937
Good night, Homer.

485
00:38:50,945 --> 00:38:52,913
<i>Good night, Homer.</i>

486
00:39:44,398 --> 00:39:48,425
<i>Actually, the army's
given me leave twice.</i>

487
00:39:48,536 --> 00:39:51,903
First, when my father died.
And now I'm on leave to help
my mom with the harvest.

488
00:39:52,006 --> 00:39:54,338
She's no farmer.
Apples were my dad's business,

489
00:39:54,442 --> 00:39:57,343
<i>but with the war on
she's short of pickers.</i>

490
00:39:57,445 --> 00:40:01,108
- Wally thinks apples are boring.
- I never said they were boring.

491
00:40:01,215 --> 00:40:04,810
<i>Yes, you did. You said apples
weren't exactly flying.</i>

492
00:40:04,919 --> 00:40:08,855
- They aren't.
- I think I would like
the apple business.

493
00:40:08,956 --> 00:40:11,686
<i>- You're a little overqualified,
aren't you?
- No.</i>

494
00:40:11,792 --> 00:40:15,990
<i>- No, not really. I need a job.
- Where are you headed?</i>

495
00:40:16,097 --> 00:40:18,827
<i>- I don't know.
- What are you gonna do?</i>

496
00:40:18,933 --> 00:40:21,197
I don't know.

497
00:40:21,302 --> 00:40:25,363
<i>Is your family in
the apple business too, Candy?</i>

498
00:40:25,473 --> 00:40:28,306
No. But I work there.
I like it.

499
00:40:28,409 --> 00:40:30,536
<i>My dad's a lobster man.</i>

500
00:40:30,645 --> 00:40:33,170
- Oh, wow.
- Mm-hmm.

501
00:40:35,082 --> 00:40:38,176
I've never actually seen
a lobster.

502
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:41,814
Are you serious?

503
00:40:41,923 --> 00:40:44,050
I've never seen
the ocean either.

504
00:40:44,158 --> 00:40:47,321
You... You've never
seen the ocean?

505
00:40:47,428 --> 00:40:50,056
<i>That's not funny.
That's serious.</i>

506
00:41:43,484 --> 00:41:45,679
It's beautiful.

507
00:41:47,888 --> 00:41:49,879
Yeah.

508
00:41:53,361 --> 00:41:55,522
Do you have cramps?

509
00:41:58,733 --> 00:42:01,201
They'll ease up soon.

510
00:42:01,302 --> 00:42:04,601
As long as the bleeding
isn't heavy, it's normal,

511
00:42:04,705 --> 00:42:07,139
it should taper
off tomorrow.

512
00:42:07,241 --> 00:42:09,801
<i>Catch!</i>

513
00:42:11,545 --> 00:42:13,536
All right.

514
00:42:13,648 --> 00:42:15,616
- Throw it back.
- Okay.

515
00:42:15,716 --> 00:42:17,980
All right!

516
00:42:18,085 --> 00:42:21,987
<i>Put your fingers on the laces.</i>

517
00:42:22,089 --> 00:42:24,319
<i>Here's China.
Here's India.</i>

518
00:42:24,425 --> 00:42:28,384
- Mm-hmm.
- Seven-hour round trip flight.
It's called the "Burma run."

519
00:42:28,496 --> 00:42:31,954
And this part's called " Flying over
the hump." These are the Himalayas.

520
00:42:32,066 --> 00:42:34,466
How high do you fly there?

521
00:42:34,568 --> 00:42:38,766
Well, I have to fly 15,000 feet
within the first 35 minutes.

522
00:42:38,873 --> 00:42:41,433
<i>Otherwise we won't make it
over the first mountain.</i>

523
00:42:41,542 --> 00:42:44,443
<i>- They got the worst
air currents in the world.
- Dangerous, huh?</i>

524
00:42:44,545 --> 00:42:48,641
Yeah. Actually,
I volunteered.

525
00:42:48,749 --> 00:42:51,775
Did you really?

526
00:42:55,022 --> 00:42:58,856
Hey, look. If you're serious
about wanting a job, picking
apples isn't that boring.

527
00:42:58,959 --> 00:43:02,451
Yeah? Oh, I would
love that, Wally.

528
00:43:07,968 --> 00:43:10,835
- See you around, Homer.
- Oh, yeah.

529
00:43:13,641 --> 00:43:17,099
- Thank you, for everything.
- Mm-hmm.

530
00:43:23,551 --> 00:43:25,519
<i>Hi, Sam.</i>

531
00:43:28,723 --> 00:43:30,691
Hi, Dad!

532
00:43:55,416 --> 00:43:57,646
Come on.
You're gonna meet my mom.

533
00:44:01,522 --> 00:44:05,481
By the way, I've been
at a wedding, all right?

534
00:44:05,593 --> 00:44:08,721
If it comes up, that's where
I met you, at the wedding.

535
00:44:17,271 --> 00:44:19,535
<i>Wally?
Wally, is that you?</i>

536
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:23,872
Mom, this is Homer Wells.

537
00:44:23,978 --> 00:44:26,572
- How do you do, Homer?
- Oh, good. How do you do?

538
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:30,741
He's the most overqualified
apple picker you'll ever meet,
but he's dying to learn.

539
00:44:30,851 --> 00:44:33,684
Really? Were you a friend
of the groom's, Homer?

540
00:44:33,788 --> 00:44:36,916
Homer's a friend of the groom's,
the bride's, everyone. Come on.

541
00:44:37,024 --> 00:44:41,051
In that case, maybe you'd
like to stay to dinner, Homer?

542
00:44:41,162 --> 00:44:44,461
<i>- Another time, Mom.
You gotta meet Mr. Rose.</i>

543
00:44:44,565 --> 00:44:46,965
You used up
all the hot water!

544
00:44:47,067 --> 00:44:49,262
- You're usin' my soap, ain't you?
- I ain't usin' no soap.

545
00:45:00,848 --> 00:45:02,873
<i>They're migrants.</i>

546
00:45:02,983 --> 00:45:07,044
They pick the fruit.
All kinds.

547
00:45:07,154 --> 00:45:10,146
They travel up and down
the coast with the seasons.

548
00:45:10,257 --> 00:45:13,385
The trick to Mr. Rose
is you have to let him be boss.

549
00:45:13,494 --> 00:45:15,587
Oh, excuse me.

550
00:45:15,696 --> 00:45:18,790
- The sink's backed up again, Wally.
- Not again.

551
00:45:18,899 --> 00:45:21,925
- Thought you said you was
gonna get us a plumber.
- Rose, this is Homer.

552
00:45:22,036 --> 00:45:25,836
- Homer, this is
Mr. Rose's daughter, Rose.
- You a plumber?

553
00:45:25,940 --> 00:45:29,239
Homer's the new picker.
He's gonna stay here with you.

554
00:45:31,545 --> 00:45:35,276
<i>- He's stayin' here?
- Yeah.</i>

555
00:45:35,382 --> 00:45:37,441
Uh-oh.

556
00:45:37,551 --> 00:45:41,783
This daughter of mine, she's just Miss
Hospitality, ain't she, Wally?

557
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:50,457
New picker?
You got lots of experience, I expect.

558
00:45:50,564 --> 00:45:52,532
<i>Homer's got no experience,
Arthur,</i>

559
00:45:52,633 --> 00:45:55,295
but he's smarter than I am
and he's a fast learner.

560
00:45:55,402 --> 00:45:57,962
Mr. Rose is gonna teach you
the apple business.

561
00:45:58,072 --> 00:46:01,337
Well, I believe
this is history.

562
00:46:01,442 --> 00:46:04,377
We're makin' history,
Wally, ain't we?

563
00:46:04,478 --> 00:46:07,311
We're makin' history
havin' this young man stay with us.

564
00:46:09,783 --> 00:46:13,310
<i>- Why don't you
show him around?</i>

565
00:46:21,495 --> 00:46:23,963
Your name is Rose Rose?

566
00:46:24,098 --> 00:46:26,157
- Pretty, ain't it?
- Very.

567
00:46:26,267 --> 00:46:30,966
- You like to read?
- I really can't read that good.

568
00:46:38,112 --> 00:46:43,140
Homer, what does
this say? Here.

569
00:46:49,089 --> 00:46:51,853
"I looked at the stars
and considered...

570
00:46:51,959 --> 00:46:55,360
<i>"how awful it would be for a man
to turn his face to them...</i>

571
00:46:55,462 --> 00:46:59,330
<i>"and he froze to death
and see no help or pity...</i>

572
00:46:59,433 --> 00:47:01,833
in all
the glittering multitude."

573
00:47:01,936 --> 00:47:04,496
More.

574
00:47:04,605 --> 00:47:07,096
<i>Since you the one...</i>

575
00:47:07,207 --> 00:47:09,437
who's smart enough to read,

576
00:47:09,543 --> 00:47:11,568
what's this here?

577
00:47:21,388 --> 00:47:25,017
<i>- It's a list of rules it seems.
- Whose rules?</i>

578
00:47:25,125 --> 00:47:27,286
I imagine they're for us,
I suppose.

579
00:47:27,394 --> 00:47:30,329
<i>Go on then.
Read 'em, Homer.</i>

580
00:47:31,732 --> 00:47:34,132
"One: Please don't smoke in bed.

581
00:47:38,238 --> 00:47:41,264
It's too late for that one.
Keep reading, Homer.

582
00:47:41,375 --> 00:47:45,402
Two: Please don't operate the grinder
or press if you've been drinking."

583
00:47:45,512 --> 00:47:48,276
You know, they ain't
our rules, Homer.

584
00:47:48,382 --> 00:47:51,749
We didn't write 'em.
I don't see no need to read 'em.

585
00:47:52,886 --> 00:47:54,820
Okay.

586
00:48:03,497 --> 00:48:06,762
<i>Good night,
you Princes of Maine,</i>

587
00:48:06,867 --> 00:48:08,994
<i>you Kings of New England.</i>

588
00:48:33,961 --> 00:48:36,361
Hoo! Remember this.

589
00:48:36,463 --> 00:48:40,991
In the morning when the grass
is wet, you can make it slide.

590
00:48:43,203 --> 00:48:45,967
- Feel it?
- Yeah.

591
00:48:46,073 --> 00:48:49,474
It's almost like flying.

592
00:48:49,576 --> 00:48:52,704
Watch out for the trees.

593
00:48:52,813 --> 00:48:55,008
Trees are flak,
antiaircraft fire...

594
00:48:55,115 --> 00:48:57,845
from the geeks
on the ground.

595
00:49:09,229 --> 00:49:11,823
- Hey, Homer.
- Hi.

596
00:49:11,932 --> 00:49:14,730
I was just showin' Homer
the orchard.

597
00:49:14,835 --> 00:49:17,269
- Kind of a geography lesson.
- Really?

598
00:49:17,404 --> 00:49:20,134
- Yeah.
- What's that?

599
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:24,643
- What?
- This, here. Looks like you've
been giving him flying lessons.

600
00:49:24,778 --> 00:49:27,338
Ah, he loved it.
Didn't you?

601
00:49:29,516 --> 00:49:31,916
Wally here thinks people
like being whacked by branches.

602
00:49:32,019 --> 00:49:35,978
- Oh, I liked it.
- Really?

603
00:49:36,123 --> 00:49:38,819
Yeah!

604
00:49:40,494 --> 00:49:43,088
- You're unbelievable.
- Well, thank you very much.

605
00:50:04,551 --> 00:50:07,076
Hey!
What's wrong with you?

606
00:50:07,187 --> 00:50:11,089
Sorry.

607
00:50:11,191 --> 00:50:15,423
That's Vernon. You better stay away from
him till he gets to know you better.

608
00:50:15,529 --> 00:50:19,226
<i>- Then you best stay away
from him even more.
- Homer.</i>

609
00:50:21,068 --> 00:50:23,730
Lieutenant's calling you.
You better watch your ass, Homer.

610
00:50:23,837 --> 00:50:25,771
Hey, Wally.

611
00:50:25,906 --> 00:50:27,874
- You gettin' along okay?
- Yeah.

612
00:50:32,513 --> 00:50:34,947
- Guess what.
- What?

613
00:50:35,082 --> 00:50:37,744
I'm shippin' out today.

614
00:50:37,851 --> 00:50:40,081
It's a little sooner
than I expected, but...

615
00:50:40,187 --> 00:50:45,591
I wanted to make sure that you're
settled and happy enough considering...

616
00:50:45,692 --> 00:50:48,388
Are you bored stiff or do you think
you can stick it out a bit?

617
00:50:48,495 --> 00:50:51,658
Yeah, of course.
I'm grateful for the job, Wally.

618
00:50:51,765 --> 00:50:54,893
I'm grateful too. It gives me
peace of mind knowin' you're
here keepin' an eye on things.

619
00:50:55,002 --> 00:50:57,436
<i>- Well, that's good.
- You about ready, Homer?</i>

620
00:50:57,538 --> 00:50:59,733
Yeah.

621
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:04,072
- Uh, look, Wally, thanks.
I'm lucky I met you.
- I'm the lucky one.

622
00:51:04,178 --> 00:51:06,510
- No, really, I'm lucky.
- Do you wanna fight about it?

623
00:51:07,915 --> 00:51:11,078
- Kidding.
- Oh, okay.

624
00:51:11,185 --> 00:51:13,244
- Take care of yourself.
- Okay.

625
00:51:13,387 --> 00:51:15,321
Bye.

626
00:51:16,523 --> 00:51:18,684
Okay, Mr. Rose.

627
00:51:46,587 --> 00:51:49,613
<i>Turn. That's right.
Turn and pull.</i>

628
00:51:49,756 --> 00:51:53,283
<i>Turn and pull.
Just like that. Good. Good.</i>

629
00:51:53,427 --> 00:51:56,726
<i>Okay, that's good. Right now
you're pickin'mostly cider apples.</i>

630
00:51:56,830 --> 00:51:59,697
All these drops here,
they good only for cider.

631
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:02,633
And you're picking apples with
the stem only half the time.

632
00:52:02,736 --> 00:52:05,637
Golden rule, Homer. You wanna
pick the apple with the stem.

633
00:52:05,739 --> 00:52:09,800
Now, see that there?
The spur right above the stem?

634
00:52:09,910 --> 00:52:13,038
That's the bud for next year's apple.
That's called the "spur."

635
00:52:13,146 --> 00:52:15,478
Pick the spur,
you're pickin' two years in one.

636
00:52:15,582 --> 00:52:19,484
You're pickin' next year's apple
before it have a chance to grow.
So you wanna leave that.

637
00:52:19,586 --> 00:52:22,214
<i>- Okay.
- All right, let me see you work.</i>

638
00:52:23,991 --> 00:52:26,858
<i>Yeah. That's good.</i>

639
00:52:28,829 --> 00:52:30,854
Yeah, that's much better.
That's better.

640
00:52:30,998 --> 00:52:33,432
I can see you got yourself
some education.

641
00:52:33,533 --> 00:52:36,434
<i>Them good hands you got.</i>

642
00:52:36,536 --> 00:52:39,869
Them hands you got, they know
what they're doin'. Ain't that right?

643
00:52:39,973 --> 00:52:43,704
<i>- I guess so.
- All right.</i>

644
00:52:43,810 --> 00:52:47,439
- You keep on workin', Homer.
I'll be right back.
- Okay.

645
00:52:47,547 --> 00:52:49,879
<i>Wilbur? Wilbur?</i>

646
00:52:51,718 --> 00:52:55,051
Wilbur?
You should read this.

647
00:52:55,155 --> 00:52:57,282
It's from the board.
Another letter.

648
00:52:57,391 --> 00:53:02,294
"Merely suggesting that some new blood
might benefit you all.

649
00:53:02,396 --> 00:53:05,832
Someone with new ideas in
the obstetrical and pediatric fields."

650
00:53:05,966 --> 00:53:09,766
I think they're just testing some ideas
for our next meeting.

651
00:53:09,870 --> 00:53:13,966
Dr. Holtz seems nice.
I think he only wants to help.

652
00:53:14,074 --> 00:53:18,568
He's a goddamn psychiatrist!
Of course he wants to help.

653
00:53:18,712 --> 00:53:20,907
He'd be happy to help
to commit me.

654
00:53:21,014 --> 00:53:23,539
It's this Mrs. Goodhall
you have to be careful of, Wilbur.

655
00:53:23,684 --> 00:53:26,482
We have to be more
than careful of Mrs. Goodhall.

656
00:53:26,586 --> 00:53:30,215
She has enough Christian zeal
to start her own country.

657
00:53:31,825 --> 00:53:34,726
I'd like to give her
a little ether.

658
00:53:34,828 --> 00:53:37,388
- So, what are you going to do?
- Take this.

659
00:53:40,567 --> 00:53:45,595
Homer Wells, born
Portland, Maine, March 2, 1915.

660
00:53:45,739 --> 00:53:47,934
<i>But Homer
was born here.</i>

661
00:53:48,041 --> 00:53:50,908
- In what was it? 1922?
- Mm-hmm.

662
00:53:51,011 --> 00:53:54,606
<i>Graduated Bowdoin College,
1935.</i>

663
00:53:54,715 --> 00:53:57,240
Harvard School of Medicine,
1939.

664
00:53:57,384 --> 00:54:00,512
<i>- That's you, Wilbur. You went there.
- An internship,</i>

665
00:54:00,620 --> 00:54:05,648
and two years of training at
the Boston Lying-In, South End Branch,

666
00:54:05,792 --> 00:54:08,522
he was judged an accomplished
gynecological...

667
00:54:08,628 --> 00:54:11,222
<i>- and obstetrical surgeon...
- That's not him.</i>

668
00:54:11,365 --> 00:54:13,799
With experience
in pediatric care.

669
00:54:13,934 --> 00:54:16,095
Wilbur, you're making
this up.

670
00:54:16,203 --> 00:54:20,503
Angela, the board
is going to replace me.

671
00:54:20,607 --> 00:54:23,576
That is what
the new blood is for.

672
00:54:23,710 --> 00:54:27,669
<i>You mean they're going to
replace you with someone
who doesn't perform abortions.</i>

673
00:54:27,814 --> 00:54:31,011
Well, we can only guess at that.
They are against the law.

674
00:54:31,118 --> 00:54:33,609
These credentials
are against the law.

675
00:54:33,754 --> 00:54:38,316
We all know I trained Homer, so his
credentials are as good as mine.

676
00:54:38,458 --> 00:54:41,359
And don't be holy to me
about the law.

677
00:54:41,461 --> 00:54:43,725
What has the law ever done
for anyone here?

678
00:54:45,298 --> 00:54:48,961
So, what do you think
about my candidate?

679
00:54:49,069 --> 00:54:53,403
What about school records?
Homer doesn't have any diplomas.

680
00:54:54,741 --> 00:54:58,006
Come here, Edna, please.
Come here.

681
00:55:04,951 --> 00:55:07,317
He will have them.

682
00:55:07,421 --> 00:55:09,981
Wilbur!

683
00:55:10,123 --> 00:55:12,216
<i>I don't know...</i>

684
00:55:15,829 --> 00:55:17,990
All of these on there, okay.

685
00:55:18,098 --> 00:55:20,157
- Gotta pack 'em tight now, y'all.
- I got it.

686
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:22,234
What do you think we do?

687
00:55:22,369 --> 00:55:25,736
- All aboard, Mrs. Worthington.
- Thank you, Arthur.

688
00:55:25,839 --> 00:55:28,740
How's this crew this year?
Got any rotten apples?

689
00:55:28,842 --> 00:55:30,833
<i>- It's a good crew, ma'am.
- Hey, Rose Rose.</i>

690
00:55:30,977 --> 00:55:33,411
<i>- You tryin' to break my finger? Damn!
- Just an accident.</i>

691
00:55:33,547 --> 00:55:36,345
<i>Excuse me.</i>

692
00:55:36,450 --> 00:55:41,353
Well, maybe we got one bad apple,
but it's nothing we can't handle.

693
00:55:41,488 --> 00:55:43,251
I see.

694
00:55:43,356 --> 00:55:45,881
<i>How's young Homer
working out?</i>

695
00:55:46,026 --> 00:55:47,994
<i>- Good. He's a smart young man.
- Hey, Homer.</i>

696
00:55:48,128 --> 00:55:50,892
<i>- Wally was right about him.
Real hard worker.
- Good.</i>

697
00:55:50,997 --> 00:55:53,363
<i>Mornin', Miss Worthington.</i>

698
00:55:53,467 --> 00:55:57,631
Why don't you come up and visit
me at the house? I know I've
got clothes that will fit you.

699
00:55:57,737 --> 00:56:00,399
- Okay.
- I'm sure I can find
a ton of things to fit you.

700
00:56:00,507 --> 00:56:04,443
<i>- Rose don't really need
any more pickin' clothes, ma'am.</i>

701
00:56:04,578 --> 00:56:07,672
- Uh-huh.
- Now don't be a party-pooper, Arthur.

702
00:56:07,814 --> 00:56:10,942
<i>I have
a beautiful blouse...</i>

703
00:56:11,051 --> 00:56:13,576
- Hey, Rose Rose.
- Homer.

704
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:15,779
- Hey.
- Hi.

705
00:56:15,922 --> 00:56:18,789
How you feelin'?

706
00:56:18,892 --> 00:56:21,793
When I'm not thinking
of Wally, I'm fine.

707
00:56:21,895 --> 00:56:25,262
I'm not really good
at being alone.

708
00:56:27,834 --> 00:56:30,997
Oh.

709
00:56:31,104 --> 00:56:33,766
Feeling much better.
Thanks.

710
00:56:36,009 --> 00:56:38,068
Hey, listen.

711
00:56:38,211 --> 00:56:43,012
<i>Maybe if you're free, you'd like to come
and have dinner at my dad's place?</i>

712
00:56:45,385 --> 00:56:49,617
- Okay.
- You haven't seen
a lobster yet, have you?

713
00:56:49,723 --> 00:56:52,453
<i>- No.
- Oh, good.</i>

714
00:57:07,941 --> 00:57:09,909
You're hungry, right?

715
00:57:26,459 --> 00:57:29,826
- What is that?
- It's a drive-in
movie theatre.

716
00:57:29,930 --> 00:57:31,864
- It's a movie outside?
- Yeah.

717
00:57:31,965 --> 00:57:33,933
<i>- Oh, can we see it?
- Okay.</i>

718
00:57:42,342 --> 00:57:45,834
- It's closed now
because of the blackouts.
- Oh.

719
00:57:47,113 --> 00:57:50,048
It's so big.

720
00:57:50,183 --> 00:57:52,583
You smoke?
You want a cigarette?

721
00:57:52,686 --> 00:57:55,177
Okay.

722
00:57:58,792 --> 00:58:02,956
Wally would kill me
if he saw me doin' this.

723
00:58:10,437 --> 00:58:13,201
- There you go.
- Thanks.

724
00:58:15,775 --> 00:58:17,709
<i>So, you like movies?</i>

725
00:58:17,844 --> 00:58:20,312
Yes. Seen only one, though.

726
00:58:23,216 --> 00:58:26,185
You've seen only one?
Which one?

727
00:58:26,319 --> 00:58:29,982
<i>Uh, King Kong.
It's really good.</i>

728
00:58:46,806 --> 00:58:48,740
Mmm. Oh.

729
00:58:48,875 --> 00:58:52,777
Wilbur, it's a pie apple. Here, look.
See? Try one of those.

730
00:58:52,912 --> 00:58:56,143
So he's an apple expert now,
is he?

731
00:58:59,052 --> 00:59:02,783
Oh, my, yes.
That's a far superior taste.

732
00:59:02,889 --> 00:59:04,857
And crisp too.

733
00:59:04,991 --> 00:59:07,459
So many apples
are disappointingly mealy.

734
00:59:07,594 --> 00:59:10,188
Wilbur, he picked these
for us himself.

735
00:59:10,330 --> 00:59:16,235
You don't find it depressing
that Homer Wells is picking apples?

736
00:59:16,336 --> 00:59:18,429
Or that he can't be bothered
to write us a proper letter?

737
00:59:18,571 --> 00:59:21,438
Wilbur, it's a gift.

738
00:59:21,541 --> 00:59:24,476
I'll show him a gift.

739
00:59:24,611 --> 00:59:27,102
I'll send him a gift
he can use.

740
00:59:34,020 --> 00:59:36,545
One of the most popular
stars on the screen.

741
00:59:36,690 --> 00:59:39,386
Today he's Lieutenant Stewart,
U.S.A.

742
00:59:46,466 --> 00:59:49,958
<i>Crossing the equator, there's a lighter
side, as novices are introduced...</i>

743
00:59:50,103 --> 00:59:53,129
<i>- to the traditional realm
of King Neptune.</i>

744
00:59:53,273 --> 00:59:58,108
<i>Boxing matches, helping relieve
the monotony of long, weary days at sea.</i>

745
01:00:19,799 --> 01:00:22,063
<i>Well, it looked
like you liked it.</i>

746
01:00:22,168 --> 01:00:25,160
<i>I did like it. All I said was,
it's no King Kong.</i>

747
01:00:25,305 --> 01:00:29,969
I mean, first she loved him,
then she didn't. Then no one
else could have him.

748
01:00:30,110 --> 01:00:33,705
No, but she did love him.
How many women have you known?

749
01:00:35,515 --> 01:00:39,315
And what did she
die of exactly?

750
01:00:39,419 --> 01:00:43,856
She was torn apart.
She died of a broken heart.

751
01:00:43,990 --> 01:00:47,221
Oh. Well, I just...

752
01:00:47,327 --> 01:00:50,057
I need a better
medical explanation.

753
01:00:52,132 --> 01:00:56,728
Torn apart. At least King Kong,
he knew what he wanted.

754
01:00:59,873 --> 01:01:02,808
Hey, what you doin'
with that Candy, Homer?

755
01:01:02,942 --> 01:01:06,901
Makin' history, I suppose.

756
01:01:07,046 --> 01:01:11,073
- You ain't gettin'
in no trouble, I hope.
- No trouble.

757
01:01:11,217 --> 01:01:15,654
That Candy, she's
the nicest girl I know.

758
01:01:15,789 --> 01:01:20,385
She's about the most beautiful
girl I've ever seen, but I
don't know if she's the nicest.

759
01:01:20,527 --> 01:01:24,190
She's the nicest and most beautiful
girl I've ever known.

760
01:01:24,330 --> 01:01:26,890
See, that sounds like
you in trouble already, Homer.

761
01:01:27,033 --> 01:01:29,092
Sounds like big trouble
to me, Homer.

762
01:01:31,871 --> 01:01:34,863
<i>- I'm not in trouble.
- Yeah, you is.</i>

763
01:01:35,008 --> 01:01:37,499
I know when people
are in trouble.
