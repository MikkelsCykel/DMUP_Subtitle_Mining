1
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,000
Tie them up.

2
00:02:01,001 --> 00:02:03,501
The hands are not the issue.

3
00:02:03,502 --> 00:02:06,202
The fight is the issue.

4
00:02:06,203 --> 00:02:08,503
The battle is the issue.

5
00:02:08,504 --> 00:02:13,004
Who imposes the terms of the battle,
will impose the terms of the peace.

6
00:02:13,305 --> 00:02:15,805
You think he has a handicap?
- No.

7
00:02:15,806 --> 00:02:19,906
The other guy has a handicap,
if he cannot control himself.

8
00:02:19,907 --> 00:02:23,407
You control yourself,
you control him.

9
00:02:25,508 --> 00:02:27,808
Take him to court.

10
00:02:30,309 --> 00:02:33,609
A man distracted is a man defeated.

11
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:37,310
That's right.
You've heard that before, huh?

12
00:02:37,311 --> 00:02:39,811
Try it again.

13
00:02:41,912 --> 00:02:45,812
Take him to court.
- Taking him to court.

14
00:02:46,313 --> 00:02:49,313
Good, got him down.
The fight is over.

15
00:02:49,314 --> 00:02:51,414
That's it.
The fight is over.

16
00:02:51,415 --> 00:02:54,415
Finish it here.
It is over.

17
00:02:56,916 --> 00:03:00,916
Ok, improve the position.
Improve the position.

18
00:03:01,417 --> 00:03:03,617
Keep the weight on his head.

19
00:03:03,618 --> 00:03:05,718
What next?

20
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:09,519
Watch the slam.
Keep your head up.

21
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,920
Nice. Nice.
You felt that, huh?

22
00:03:12,921 --> 00:03:15,521
Good.
Keep it back.

23
00:03:15,522 --> 00:03:17,922
Observe.

24
00:03:19,023 --> 00:03:20,823
Ok, improve.

25
00:03:20,824 --> 00:03:24,224
<i>Breath, breath.</i>

26
00:03:26,525 --> 00:03:30,625
<i>Good. Good.
You felt that. Good.</i>

27
00:03:32,826 --> 00:03:34,826
<i>Ok.</i>

28
00:03:34,827 --> 00:03:39,227
Improve the position.
Improve the position. Good.

29
00:03:39,228 --> 00:03:41,928
Where?
Take him to Brazil.

30
00:03:41,929 --> 00:03:43,729
Good. Good.

31
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:48,130
Arm grip. See that.
Excellent.

32
00:03:50,631 --> 00:03:55,231
Triangle. Hold.
Insist. Insist on him.

33
00:03:55,232 --> 00:03:57,432
Insist on the move.

34
00:03:59,233 --> 00:04:01,533
Good.
Now, what?

35
00:04:01,534 --> 00:04:05,734
Breath. Breath. Breath.

36
00:04:06,635 --> 00:04:08,935
Good.
Good hit.

37
00:04:10,036 --> 00:04:13,036
Ok.
Breath. Breath.

38
00:04:13,037 --> 00:04:15,937
Breath. You know the escape.
You know the escape.

39
00:04:15,938 --> 00:04:18,538
Breath. Breath.

40
00:04:18,539 --> 00:04:21,039
There's always an escape.

41
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:25,540
You know the escape.
You know the escape.

42
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:26,841
Breath.
There's always an escape.

43
00:04:26,842 --> 00:04:29,142
I'm passing out.

44
00:04:29,143 --> 00:04:31,143
All right.

45
00:04:34,044 --> 00:04:36,244
Great class.

46
00:04:36,845 --> 00:04:39,345
Great class.

47
00:04:40,646 --> 00:04:42,046
C'mon buddy.
- Great.

48
00:04:42,047 --> 00:04:44,347
Hey, stick around.

49
00:04:48,048 --> 00:04:50,348
You don't fight your way clear?

50
00:04:50,349 --> 00:04:52,749
I was passing out.

51
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,550
There is no situation,
you cannot escape from.

52
00:04:55,551 --> 00:04:57,751
You know the escape.

53
00:04:57,952 --> 00:05:00,052
You know the escape,
show it to me.

54
00:05:00,053 --> 00:05:01,553
Show it to me.

55
00:05:01,554 --> 00:05:03,254
Show me the escape.

56
00:05:03,255 --> 00:05:06,355
Good, good.
You know the escape.

57
00:05:06,356 --> 00:05:08,256
You just got tired.
What's the lesson?

58
00:05:08,257 --> 00:05:11,257
Don't get tired.
- Let the other guy get tired.

59
00:05:11,658 --> 00:05:14,858
You want to fight like a black belt, huh?

60
00:05:15,059 --> 00:05:17,859
You want to test for the black belt?

61
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:21,260
Snowflake, give him his wish.

62
00:05:21,261 --> 00:05:24,461
Alright, raise your hands.
Your hands, get them right up.

63
00:05:24,462 --> 00:05:28,763
Concentrate on the fight.

64
00:05:28,764 --> 00:05:32,464
Insist.
Insist.

65
00:05:34,565 --> 00:05:37,465
Did you tell me
this training saved your life?

66
00:05:37,466 --> 00:05:39,866
This is how you would pay me?

67
00:05:39,867 --> 00:05:42,567
Breath through it,
the moves work.

68
00:05:42,568 --> 00:05:44,868
Defend the neck.

69
00:05:46,669 --> 00:05:49,069
Take the fight out of your face.

70
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:52,070
Well, that's it.
Officer down.

71
00:05:52,271 --> 00:05:54,771
That makes you mad.

72
00:05:54,872 --> 00:05:59,472
Control your emotions.
Control your emotions!

73
00:05:59,473 --> 00:06:02,873
Breath.
Breath.

74
00:06:02,974 --> 00:06:04,874
Breath.

75
00:06:04,975 --> 00:06:10,475
Alright. Ok, that's it.
That's it.

76
00:06:14,376 --> 00:06:16,376
Good.

77
00:06:16,577 --> 00:06:19,877
Hit the showers and
come back in. Good.

78
00:06:22,778 --> 00:06:24,878
Good.

79
00:06:25,979 --> 00:06:27,779
You're ok?
- Yeah.

80
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:31,180
He is good, huh?
- Yeah, he is good.

81
00:06:39,381 --> 00:06:40,781
Hi, I'm lost.

82
00:06:40,782 --> 00:06:44,282
I can't find the fucking pharmacy.
What?

83
00:06:44,983 --> 00:06:47,183
I don't know.

84
00:06:48,384 --> 00:06:51,684
Well, you said I have to find it
before eight o'clock.

85
00:06:53,685 --> 00:06:56,685
Thank you.
Ok.

86
00:07:30,986 --> 00:07:34,186
Hey, hey.
Wait.

87
00:07:34,187 --> 00:07:37,487
Hey, stop.

88
00:07:44,388 --> 00:07:46,988
Answer the phone.

89
00:07:46,989 --> 00:07:49,689
Hi, yeah I missed the guy.

90
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:53,090
He needed your help with some
of those things.

91
00:07:53,091 --> 00:07:57,291
No, a regular doctor is not going to
fill the prescription.

92
00:07:57,492 --> 00:07:59,292
What?

93
00:07:59,693 --> 00:08:02,393
Because he is closed.

94
00:08:03,394 --> 00:08:08,394
The prescription is not going to
stand up at a straight pharmacy.

95
00:08:09,195 --> 00:08:11,395
Alright, but I need...

96
00:08:13,996 --> 00:08:16,296
Alright, ok.

97
00:08:27,697 --> 00:08:28,697
Hello?

98
00:08:28,698 --> 00:08:32,698
Hi, this is Sondra Terry with
Southside Ju-Jitsu.

99
00:08:33,199 --> 00:08:37,299
Yeah, I have your
invoice number 20903.

100
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:43,400
Yeah, you indicate that you didn't
receive our payment.

101
00:08:45,101 --> 00:08:49,601
Ok, but...
On my record it shows that...

102
00:08:49,602 --> 00:08:53,102
Look, I'm trying to run a business
just like you.

103
00:08:55,603 --> 00:08:57,603
I'll wait.

104
00:09:01,904 --> 00:09:04,204
As all the world knows,
tomorrow is Wednesday.

105
00:09:04,205 --> 00:09:06,605
So we will be on Wednesday schedule.

106
00:09:06,606 --> 00:09:08,306
9 AM.
Beginning self defense.

107
00:09:08,307 --> 00:09:10,407
11.15 AM.
I am watching the match.

108
00:09:10,408 --> 00:09:14,208
You going to have to train if you
want that black belt, officer Joe.

109
00:09:14,209 --> 00:09:15,509
Mike?

110
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:18,310
What you want the officer walk you home?

111
00:09:18,611 --> 00:09:19,911
It's rough out there.

112
00:09:19,912 --> 00:09:22,112
Well, after he gets his black belt
he can walk me to the car.

113
00:09:22,113 --> 00:09:23,313
That will make me feel secure.

114
00:09:23,314 --> 00:09:24,914
How is the belt going to make you feel secure?

115
00:09:24,915 --> 00:09:27,815
I know his fucking pants
are not going to fall down.

116
00:09:30,916 --> 00:09:33,516
Hey, by the way.
Aren't you going to buy a new rig?

117
00:09:33,517 --> 00:09:34,917
I was thinking about it.

118
00:09:34,918 --> 00:09:36,818
Oh, you were thinking about it.

119
00:09:36,819 --> 00:09:39,819
I tell you what, why don't you take
some of that good off-duty money..

120
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:43,020
..and buy a new shoulder-rig.
Why?

121
00:09:43,921 --> 00:09:46,521
A shoulder is nothing but a handlebar.
- Ok.

122
00:09:46,522 --> 00:09:48,722
Excuse me.
Eh, who is this?

123
00:09:48,723 --> 00:09:50,323
It's all right.
Come in, come in.

124
00:09:50,324 --> 00:09:51,524
Hi.
- Mike?

125
00:09:51,525 --> 00:09:54,325
I believe I..
- Mike, can you come here please?

126
00:09:54,326 --> 00:09:56,326
Yes, thank you.
I was driving..

127
00:09:56,327 --> 00:09:58,527
Take off your coat.
How can we help you?

128
00:09:58,528 --> 00:10:00,028
Look, I heard your car..

129
00:10:00,029 --> 00:10:02,529
Hey Joe, take the lady's coat. Come on.

130
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:04,330
..the car, I pay you cash.
So we can just..

131
00:10:04,331 --> 00:10:05,731
No, stay away from me!
- Miss?

132
00:10:05,732 --> 00:10:08,132
Don't touch me!
No, don't touch me.

133
00:10:15,433 --> 00:10:18,133
I am a police officer!

134
00:10:48,134 --> 00:10:50,434
The wind blew something into
the window.

135
00:10:50,435 --> 00:10:53,335
The wind blew something into the window?
- Yeah.

136
00:10:53,336 --> 00:10:57,936
Yeah, sure.
You're all ok?

137
00:10:57,937 --> 00:10:59,937
Yeah, we're fine.

138
00:10:59,938 --> 00:11:02,238
You want me to start to clean up?

139
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:05,139
Yeah, thanks Snowflake.

140
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:08,340
What else am I going to say,
she's trying to kill a police officer?

141
00:11:08,341 --> 00:11:12,341
Are you sure?
- I am sure.

142
00:11:15,942 --> 00:11:18,142
It's ok.

143
00:11:41,343 --> 00:11:44,543
I am an attorney, I...
I can't let...

144
00:11:44,544 --> 00:11:47,044
The officer thinks it didn't happen.

145
00:11:47,045 --> 00:11:48,845
Eh, I'm sorry...

146
00:11:48,846 --> 00:11:51,146
He thinks it didn't happen.

147
00:12:16,347 --> 00:12:19,847
I thought you were going to the mountains?
- No, that's funny.

148
00:12:19,848 --> 00:12:21,648
Joe?
Is Joe still inside?

149
00:12:21,649 --> 00:12:23,449
No, he just left.
- Left?

150
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:25,850
Yeah, maybe he went to the club.

151
00:12:25,851 --> 00:12:28,951
What happened to the window?
- Isn't he on at the club?

152
00:12:28,952 --> 00:12:33,252
Ehm, that's funny.
- Weren't you going to the mountains?

153
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:36,253
Why would he go to the club?
- Isn't he working tonight?

154
00:12:36,254 --> 00:12:40,254
The club? No, he hasn't worked
at the club in months.

155
00:12:40,355 --> 00:12:44,655
Listen, I have to tell him something.

156
00:12:44,856 --> 00:12:47,756
Ok, tell him.
- Why?

157
00:12:47,757 --> 00:12:50,457
Why what?
- Why hasn't he been working there?

158
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:53,558
Yeah, no.
Listen, I got to get home.

159
00:13:15,059 --> 00:13:19,759
Officer Joe let the girl walk?
- Yeah, I suppose he did.

160
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,060
That was generous of him.

161
00:13:22,161 --> 00:13:24,361
Yeah, I think so.

162
00:13:24,962 --> 00:13:27,362
Why did he do that?

163
00:13:27,363 --> 00:13:30,263
He didn't want to bring the sauna
on the academy.

164
00:13:30,264 --> 00:13:32,064
Yes, of course.

165
00:13:32,065 --> 00:13:34,265
I need a black belt for him.

166
00:13:34,266 --> 00:13:37,466
You didn't want to bring the sauna
on the academy.

167
00:13:37,967 --> 00:13:41,167
Yes, thank you.

168
00:13:43,168 --> 00:13:46,268
The car?
- Car?

169
00:13:46,269 --> 00:13:49,069
The girl drove into your car.

170
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:51,770
I didn't look at that.

171
00:13:51,971 --> 00:13:55,171
They want cash to get the window
bought it up.

172
00:13:55,372 --> 00:13:57,472
Do you have any cash?

173
00:13:57,973 --> 00:14:02,173
And on your business,
for which you have no cash.

174
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:04,774
We need to replace the window.

175
00:14:04,775 --> 00:14:06,775
Your cheque bounced.

176
00:14:06,776 --> 00:14:08,876
My cheque?

177
00:14:09,177 --> 00:14:11,577
The martial art supply.

178
00:14:11,778 --> 00:14:14,778
Mike, we're short.

179
00:14:14,779 --> 00:14:17,079
You have no cash.

180
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:20,880
If we pay the window,
I can't make the rent.

181
00:14:23,681 --> 00:14:25,581
Hello.

182
00:14:47,682 --> 00:14:51,382
You need your ass kick out
for a loan.

183
00:14:51,383 --> 00:14:55,383
Mike, you go ask him for a loan.

184
00:15:57,784 --> 00:15:59,884
Hey, Mike.

185
00:16:00,185 --> 00:16:02,285
Hey, Billy.

186
00:16:02,286 --> 00:16:04,686
Jimmy, you can't smoke in here.

187
00:16:04,687 --> 00:16:08,787
We got Mike Terry down here.
- The fucking world is turning into a dungeon.

188
00:16:09,988 --> 00:16:12,588
Hey, sorry. He's busy.
Five minutes.

189
00:16:12,589 --> 00:16:15,289
Cardo said that?
- No, Bruno. Ricardo is out.

190
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:17,690
Put the cigarette out.

191
00:16:21,491 --> 00:16:24,491
Hang on, I'll take a beer.
- You haven’t got no bouncer?

192
00:16:24,492 --> 00:16:26,992
Just weekends now.
- Officer Joe?

193
00:16:26,993 --> 00:16:30,393
Billy, I show you something for a drink.

194
00:16:30,394 --> 00:16:32,594
I hardly think so.
Joey, the cop?

195
00:16:32,595 --> 00:16:35,595
Yeah.
- Wait, come on. I'll wait for this drink.

196
00:16:35,596 --> 00:16:37,496
Check out this dice.

197
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:39,397
So where you've been,
the cruise ships?

198
00:16:39,398 --> 00:16:40,998
I worked on a cruise ship.

199
00:16:40,999 --> 00:16:43,299
Why Joe quit?
- Yeah, hold on a second.

200
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,500
Check this out.

201
00:16:50,101 --> 00:16:51,901
You ever seen that?

202
00:16:51,902 --> 00:16:55,102
I am fucking fantastic, somebody
buy me this fucking drink.

203
00:16:55,103 --> 00:16:58,003
Officer Joe, why did he quit?
- What?

204
00:16:58,004 --> 00:16:59,804
Why Joe quit?

205
00:16:59,805 --> 00:17:03,205
Because Bruno wasn't paying him.
They never paid him.

206
00:17:03,206 --> 00:17:05,406
They never paid him?

207
00:17:10,907 --> 00:17:13,307
<i>Coming from that
Brazilian Ju-Jitsu background,</i>

208
00:17:13,308 --> 00:17:17,008
<i>I spent a little time with Silva years ago
before he moved into MMA.</i>

209
00:17:17,009 --> 00:17:20,409
<i>He showed me his secret technique
that his grandfather showed him.</i>

210
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:24,310
<i>I said we'll be doing that since
I was twelve in High School wrestling.</i>

211
00:17:24,311 --> 00:17:26,911
We have a deal or we don't have a deal?

212
00:17:27,312 --> 00:17:30,312
<i>He's going to have his hands full of
Morisaki, but I think it's going to be a great fight.</i>

213
00:17:30,313 --> 00:17:32,813
<i>I don't know why everybody is not
coming to this fight.</i>

214
00:17:32,814 --> 00:17:34,914
<i>The main event for the IFA..</i>

215
00:17:35,115 --> 00:17:36,415
We got a deal.

216
00:17:36,416 --> 00:17:39,116
What good is a deal,
if nobody is making any money?

217
00:17:39,117 --> 00:17:40,517
Ricardo won't do it.

218
00:17:40,518 --> 00:17:42,118
What? He's to pure?

219
00:17:42,119 --> 00:17:44,719
What, it's not elegant?
That elegant life he lives.

220
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,020
How long is that going to last?
Answer me that.

221
00:17:47,021 --> 00:17:49,321
Morisaki is going to do it?

222
00:17:49,322 --> 00:17:50,422
This bullshit.

223
00:17:50,423 --> 00:17:53,923
Morisaki is a whore, he's going to do
whatever the fuck I tell his people.

224
00:17:53,924 --> 00:17:55,924
If he did this, he'll do anything.

225
00:17:55,925 --> 00:18:00,125
The golden ivory studded belt is
worth 250.000 dollar.

226
00:18:00,126 --> 00:18:03,726
It was presented to Taketa Morisaki
by the emperor of Japan.

227
00:18:03,727 --> 00:18:05,427
Is he on the level?

228
00:18:05,428 --> 00:18:08,728
The belt is a fucking national treasure,
it's worth 250.000 dollar.

229
00:18:08,729 --> 00:18:10,929
He's going to give it to
Ricardo if he loses?

230
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:13,830
It's publicity.
It's publicity.

231
00:18:13,831 --> 00:18:16,231
It's something to tell the papers.

232
00:18:16,232 --> 00:18:17,532
It's a story.

233
00:18:17,533 --> 00:18:22,433
I am a samurai. Should this guardian
defeat me, I will surrender my fucking belt.

234
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:24,334
And will he?

235
00:18:24,935 --> 00:18:26,735
We're not selling tickets.

236
00:18:26,736 --> 00:18:31,236
Sell the tickets, sell the show.
And we figure that out on the way to the bank.

237
00:18:31,237 --> 00:18:33,937
The point is,
you've got to sell the show.

238
00:18:33,938 --> 00:18:35,538
Ricardo is the biggest thing in Brazil.

239
00:18:35,539 --> 00:18:38,539
Read the street signs,
we're in America..

240
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:40,240
...Morisaki is doing his part.

241
00:18:40,241 --> 00:18:43,341
You've got to do yours,
Ricardo's got to do his.

242
00:18:43,342 --> 00:18:45,142
Where the fuck is he?

243
00:18:45,143 --> 00:18:47,443
Pay per view is pulling back
on the promotion.

244
00:18:47,444 --> 00:18:49,144
We need a gimmick.

245
00:18:49,145 --> 00:18:51,145
One more time.

246
00:18:51,146 --> 00:18:53,746
Ricardo brings the old man up
from Brazil.

247
00:18:53,747 --> 00:18:56,047
He fights for the honor of his mentor.

248
00:18:56,048 --> 00:18:59,548
Morisaki brings the belt,
he fights for the emperor.

249
00:18:59,549 --> 00:19:01,249
What do you got?
A grouch match.

250
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:03,850
It's back to the thirties.
Black against white.

251
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:07,351
Irish against Jew,
a racial grouch match.

252
00:19:07,352 --> 00:19:09,852
Give me some velocity,
velocity.

253
00:19:09,853 --> 00:19:12,553
Or else,
it's just two monkeys in the ring.

254
00:19:18,054 --> 00:19:20,154
Yeah, we will speak English here in front
of my friend.

255
00:19:20,155 --> 00:19:24,355
Marty Brown, this is my brother in law.
- Mike Terry, can I have a word with you?

256
00:19:26,956 --> 00:19:29,156
We're trying to do business, Mike.

257
00:19:29,157 --> 00:19:30,257
What do you want?

258
00:19:30,258 --> 00:19:32,358
I got to talk to you about money.
- Money?

259
00:19:32,359 --> 00:19:34,259
Yeah.
- You want money?

260
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:35,660
I tell you what.

261
00:19:35,661 --> 00:19:37,161
Fight on the under garden.

262
00:19:37,162 --> 00:19:38,662
I'll put you in the under garden.

263
00:19:38,663 --> 00:19:40,763
Round robin.
Winner takes home 50,000 dollar.

264
00:19:40,764 --> 00:19:42,564
You got a good chance of take
home the money.

265
00:19:42,565 --> 00:19:43,865
Fight on the under garden.

266
00:19:43,866 --> 00:19:46,266
Joe Collins, the cop.

267
00:19:46,267 --> 00:19:49,867
Joe Collins, the cop?
- Yeah, your bouncer.

268
00:19:49,868 --> 00:19:54,568
He worked here several months, now he's...
- All right! All right, I got it.

269
00:19:54,569 --> 00:19:55,969
Did you ever pay him?

270
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:58,270
Did I pay him?
- Yeah.

271
00:19:58,271 --> 00:20:00,271
What the fuck do you care?

272
00:20:00,272 --> 00:20:01,272
Did you pay him?

273
00:20:01,273 --> 00:20:03,773
No, I heard you but what business
is it of yours?

274
00:20:03,774 --> 00:20:05,274
The guy has got a family.

275
00:20:05,275 --> 00:20:07,475
I know what the fuck you are saying,
this guy has got a family

276
00:20:07,476 --> 00:20:09,376
and I owe him some money.
And what?

277
00:20:09,377 --> 00:20:11,577
Is this some business of yours?
- Did you pay him?

278
00:20:11,578 --> 00:20:13,478
I told him as I recall.

279
00:20:13,479 --> 00:20:17,179
He would have to wait for his money.
He got hotheaded and quit.

280
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:33,180
Yeah, this is Bruno Silva.
Put him on.

281
00:20:33,681 --> 00:20:35,781
Chet Frank just walked into the bar,

282
00:20:35,782 --> 00:20:38,482
without his wife,
without his bodyguard.

283
00:20:38,483 --> 00:20:41,683
No, no.
Get a news crew outside and...

284
00:20:41,684 --> 00:20:43,484
Who did they get the tip from?

285
00:20:43,485 --> 00:20:45,785
Some cabby driving by,
what the fuck do I care.

286
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:47,986
Chet Frank just walked into my bar.

287
00:20:47,987 --> 00:20:50,187
Would you call the newspapers?
Thank you.

288
00:20:50,188 --> 00:20:53,688
Thank you for stopping by.
How's my sister?

289
00:20:56,689 --> 00:20:59,489
I'll have paparinga.
- I'll have another one too.

290
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:02,290
I take care of the ladies drink.
- How you're doing these days, Chet?

291
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:05,591
Everything is a fucking struggle, you know?
- Take the high ground, Chet.

292
00:21:05,592 --> 00:21:07,692
Yeah, right.
- The lady thanks you.

293
00:21:07,693 --> 00:21:08,993
Anything for beauty.

294
00:21:08,994 --> 00:21:12,794
Nobody's tough when it comes to beauty.
- Indeed, indeed.

295
00:21:12,795 --> 00:21:13,995
Excuse me.
- My pleasure.

296
00:21:13,996 --> 00:21:16,696
I'd like to buy that,
she's a friend of mine.

297
00:21:16,697 --> 00:21:18,797
I admire your taste.
- What?

298
00:21:18,798 --> 00:21:21,798
I'm sorry, what did you say?
- I said, I admire your taste.

299
00:21:21,799 --> 00:21:24,299
Yeah I heard what you said,
I just don't know what it means.

300
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:26,000
All right.
- What does it mean?

301
00:21:26,001 --> 00:21:27,901
Whatever you want it to mean.

302
00:21:27,902 --> 00:21:30,902
I've had a tough day.
- And what the fuck is that to me!

303
00:21:30,903 --> 00:21:33,103
Fucking tough guy in the movies.
- Look...

304
00:21:33,104 --> 00:21:36,104
Hey, where is your protection tough guy?
- I didn't know that you knew the woman.

305
00:21:36,105 --> 00:21:38,805
Well, you insulted me and
then you insulted the young woman

306
00:21:38,806 --> 00:21:40,606
and don't you have a wife?

307
00:21:40,607 --> 00:21:43,207
Yeah, didn't I actually read
that you have a wife?

308
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:45,608
You come here for fighting or
you come here for a drink?

309
00:21:45,609 --> 00:21:47,709
Maybe you came to the wrong
fucking place.

310
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:49,310
You know what?
- Just calm down.

311
00:21:49,311 --> 00:21:51,611
Let me go, man. I'm calm.
You fucking calm down.

312
00:21:51,612 --> 00:21:53,612
Just cam down.
Have a seat.

313
00:21:53,613 --> 00:21:54,613
Have some ideas?

314
00:21:54,614 --> 00:21:57,614
I don't think you do.
- Oh, I don't?

315
00:21:59,115 --> 00:22:02,115
I just want to have a drink.

316
00:22:06,316 --> 00:22:10,216
Come on. How you like that, man?
Come on. Take that!

317
00:22:13,317 --> 00:22:16,417
All right, make a lane.

318
00:22:59,118 --> 00:23:01,618
Hey, baby.
You can hear me.

319
00:23:01,619 --> 00:23:03,819
You can hear me.

320
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,820
I'm all right.

321
00:23:09,321 --> 00:23:11,221
Do you think he's got a guy
or something?

322
00:23:11,222 --> 00:23:12,922
I'm sure they made the call.

323
00:23:12,923 --> 00:23:16,923
Hey pal, why did you come out alone?

324
00:23:17,624 --> 00:23:22,424
You looking for trouble?
- Huh?

325
00:23:23,625 --> 00:23:27,825
He's ok.
He's all right.

326
00:23:41,726 --> 00:23:44,626
You banished the professor down here?

327
00:23:54,827 --> 00:23:57,127
Here you go.

328
00:23:59,528 --> 00:24:02,728
I thought Joey was on the door?
- No.

329
00:24:02,729 --> 00:24:09,229
Hey Mike, what the fuck happened?
- I don't know some kind of bar fight.

330
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:13,930
Show it to me.

331
00:24:14,931 --> 00:24:19,331
What we're talking about here?
- A couple of bad boys jumped on a movie star.

332
00:24:19,332 --> 00:24:20,832
How about that?

333
00:24:20,833 --> 00:24:23,233
Loomis says him out of the ambulance.

334
00:24:23,234 --> 00:24:26,334
What happened to them,
they fall down?

335
00:24:26,335 --> 00:24:29,135
Something like that, I think.

336
00:24:30,036 --> 00:24:33,136
Our friend here is all by himself.

337
00:24:34,037 --> 00:24:36,237
Jesus Christ!

338
00:24:36,238 --> 00:24:40,038
You got the tape, I never threw a punch.

339
00:24:40,039 --> 00:24:42,639
I am a stone cold victim.

340
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:46,640
What happened to the other guys?
- How would I know?

341
00:24:47,641 --> 00:24:49,641
What about you?

342
00:24:50,242 --> 00:24:52,842
Nobody knows who I am.

343
00:25:32,543 --> 00:25:36,843
You didn't get the loan?
- Ricardo wasn't there.

344
00:25:36,844 --> 00:25:39,544
Did you ask Bruno for it?

345
00:25:42,045 --> 00:25:44,545
He didn't ask for it.

346
00:25:46,546 --> 00:25:49,046
Are you afraid of money?

347
00:25:50,247 --> 00:25:53,547
You tell me how we can run
the academy without money?

348
00:25:53,548 --> 00:25:58,348
You tell me that, so I can do it.
And not disturb you in your purity.

349
00:25:58,449 --> 00:26:01,349
How am I going to run my business,
all the time you need me.

350
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:04,650
All the time, all my money
is going to yours.

351
00:26:06,251 --> 00:26:09,251
There are some things,
I don't understand.

352
00:26:11,252 --> 00:26:15,152
My father made money,
my brothers make money

353
00:26:15,153 --> 00:26:18,853
and you are somehow to pure.

354
00:26:19,254 --> 00:26:22,554
You're to pure to compete.

355
00:26:22,555 --> 00:26:24,755
It weakens the fighter.
- That's right.

356
00:26:24,756 --> 00:26:28,756
Because the competition is not a fight.
- That's correct.

357
00:26:30,257 --> 00:26:33,457
And what about the fighters family,
Mike?

358
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:36,258
What are they going to eat?

359
00:26:36,259 --> 00:26:38,859
While he is being so pure.

360
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:44,560
I have to take money from my business,
which is making money.

361
00:26:44,961 --> 00:26:48,361
If you replace the window,
you can't pay your rent.

362
00:26:48,362 --> 00:26:51,562
The insurance will replace the window.

363
00:26:51,563 --> 00:26:53,863
Do you want to turn your friend in?

364
00:26:53,864 --> 00:26:56,664
Your precious friend?
- Yeah.

365
00:26:56,665 --> 00:26:58,865
Your proudest student?

366
00:26:58,966 --> 00:27:01,566
The policeman?

367
00:27:01,867 --> 00:27:04,667
The girl tried to kill him,
and he let her go.

368
00:27:04,668 --> 00:27:06,568
The girl, if he turned her in.

369
00:27:06,569 --> 00:27:09,069
The cops would have said it was
attempted murder.

370
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:12,570
And wasn't it?
- It was an accidental discharge.

371
00:27:12,571 --> 00:27:15,471
Was it?
- She is disturbed. All right?

372
00:27:15,472 --> 00:27:18,672
The girl was disturbed.
- And now well, you adopt her?

373
00:27:18,673 --> 00:27:21,373
She walks into your academy
and so you take responsibility for her crime?

374
00:27:21,374 --> 00:27:24,274
They would have prosecuted her,
she would have gone to jail.

375
00:27:24,275 --> 00:27:27,275
It would have ruined her life.
And so yes, he gave her a pass.

376
00:27:27,276 --> 00:27:30,676
I knew you think it was noble.
The code of the warrior.

377
00:27:30,677 --> 00:27:32,877
Do you think it is noble?
- No, I think it is correct.

378
00:27:32,878 --> 00:27:37,678
Well, that's fine. Except, as
we reported the wind blew in the window.

379
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:41,179
It was an act of God and not covered
under a specific policy.

380
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:43,280
And so, until we find the money

381
00:27:43,281 --> 00:27:46,581
we have to live with a broken window.

382
00:27:46,882 --> 00:27:50,782
And you tell me how that
brings money into your business.

383
00:27:52,983 --> 00:27:54,883
Hello.

384
00:27:55,384 --> 00:27:58,384
Hi Niki.
Yeah.

385
00:27:58,385 --> 00:28:01,885
No, I can't order the new fabric now.

386
00:28:02,186 --> 00:28:04,386
No, I can't.

387
00:28:04,987 --> 00:28:07,087
I can't.

388
00:28:07,588 --> 00:28:10,288
Of course I am going to re-order.

389
00:28:11,789 --> 00:28:15,889
Ok.
Niki, I'll see you in ten minutes, ok?

390
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:17,990
Ok, bye.

391
00:28:20,191 --> 00:28:22,191
Now I have to fix the window.

392
00:28:22,192 --> 00:28:28,192
Where am I getting the cash to buy the new fabric
for my business? Without which we cannot eat.

393
00:28:28,193 --> 00:28:30,193
One moment.

394
00:28:31,494 --> 00:28:34,194
Where did you get that cut?

395
00:28:37,595 --> 00:28:39,695
Thank you.

396
00:28:39,696 --> 00:28:42,096
It's for you.

397
00:28:48,797 --> 00:28:50,497
What is it?

398
00:28:50,498 --> 00:28:52,298
It's an invitation.

399
00:28:52,299 --> 00:28:55,199
Who is it from?
- From Chet Frank.

400
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:59,600
Chet Frank? - Yeah, we're invited
to his house for dinner tonight.

401
00:29:01,101 --> 00:29:04,601
To Chet Frank's house?
- That's right.

402
00:29:16,202 --> 00:29:18,202
Really?

403
00:29:28,403 --> 00:29:31,803
Where is Joe? - Oh Mike, tell him.
What's the best weapon in the world.

404
00:29:31,804 --> 00:29:34,104
The best weapon in the world is a flashlight.
- Tell him why.

405
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:36,705
So you can look deep in the other guys eyes.

406
00:29:36,706 --> 00:29:39,506
I heard they had a dust stop at the Sao Paula
last night. - Is that right?

407
00:29:39,507 --> 00:29:42,807
Yeah, two motherfuckers ran to Quisonar.
- You can't believe everything you hear.

408
00:29:42,808 --> 00:29:45,008
Fucking Lennie and Loomis saw the tape.

409
00:29:45,009 --> 00:29:47,109
They said it was better than Thai-tanic!

410
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:49,610
We're going to ride or you still getting pretty?
- I'll be right out.

411
00:29:49,611 --> 00:29:53,211
I wished I was there Mike?
- I wish I was there too. Hey Mike.

412
00:29:53,212 --> 00:29:55,912
Did you calm down because of that thing?

413
00:29:55,913 --> 00:29:57,613
Thing? What thing?

414
00:29:57,614 --> 00:30:00,014
I got something for you.

415
00:30:03,615 --> 00:30:06,515
No?
- Yeah.

416
00:30:07,916 --> 00:30:11,016
I don't deserve it.
- Yes, you do.

417
00:30:11,917 --> 00:30:14,317
The belt is just symbolic.

418
00:30:14,318 --> 00:30:18,418
The belt, as Snowflake says, is just
to keep your pants up.

419
00:30:24,119 --> 00:30:26,219
Thank you.

420
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:30,220
One thing.
- What?

421
00:30:30,221 --> 00:30:31,821
You said a reminder about the thing.

422
00:30:31,822 --> 00:30:34,122
The thing with the girl,
that never happened.

423
00:30:34,123 --> 00:30:37,123
Thank you.
- You're welcome.

424
00:30:40,824 --> 00:30:44,624
Open it later.
- What is it?

425
00:30:44,625 --> 00:30:47,225
Well, it's a wristwatch.

426
00:30:47,226 --> 00:30:49,826
Yours? Who's is it?
- It's yours.

427
00:30:49,827 --> 00:30:53,727
I set you up with a job with my people
who did stiffed you.

428
00:30:53,728 --> 00:30:57,128
Yeah, you went to the club?
- Why you didn't tell me they weren't paying you?

429
00:30:57,129 --> 00:31:00,329
You know, I...
- Well, they paid you now.

430
00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:05,130
That thing, take it.
Take your wife to the mountains.

431
00:31:06,631 --> 00:31:09,131
What does the black belt mean?

432
00:31:09,132 --> 00:31:13,132
That I represent the academy.
- Then respect your teacher.

433
00:31:29,833 --> 00:31:32,733
Hey, what's going on?

434
00:31:33,334 --> 00:31:37,434
Who ordered this?
Who's paying for this?

435
00:31:50,735 --> 00:31:55,235
Mr Terry, I'm hardly ashamed of what I did.
I am so sorry.

436
00:31:55,236 --> 00:31:59,236
I will of course make it well. This is a cheque,
for the damage I did to your car.

437
00:31:59,237 --> 00:32:03,137
And I would like to contact the police officer
to thank him, for what he did.

438
00:32:03,138 --> 00:32:04,538
I don't know what you're talking about.

439
00:32:04,539 --> 00:32:07,239
Mr Terry, I'm an attorney.
I know what the officer did.

440
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:11,940
Out of courtesy, he reframed from
actions that might have sent me to jail,

441
00:32:11,941 --> 00:32:15,141
or to some institutions.
- Hey, baby.

442
00:32:15,142 --> 00:32:17,042
Hey, Richard.

443
00:32:17,043 --> 00:32:18,743
Hey, who do you like in the
Morisaki fight?

444
00:32:18,744 --> 00:32:22,344
I'm sure one of them is going to win.
- A little word from a little bird.

445
00:32:22,345 --> 00:32:24,145
Yeah, I don't play that.

446
00:32:24,146 --> 00:32:26,746
Well if you did, who would you like?
- I can't help you, Richard.

447
00:32:26,747 --> 00:32:28,747
You sure? Because if you help me,
I am going to help you.

448
00:32:28,748 --> 00:32:30,048
That's the word to the wise.

449
00:32:30,049 --> 00:32:32,749
On this fight, it's sufficient to put some
groceries money in your pocket.

450
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:35,150
Who does it hurt, Mike?
- I can't help you, Richard.

451
00:32:35,151 --> 00:32:39,251
You know as much as me.
- I know as much as you?

452
00:32:46,252 --> 00:32:48,252
Mr Terry,

453
00:32:49,353 --> 00:32:52,253
as you can see, I...

454
00:32:52,754 --> 00:32:56,254
I have a problem,
I have something of a problem.

455
00:32:56,855 --> 00:33:02,155
Is there someway,
that I can help you?

456
00:33:12,456 --> 00:33:14,556
You work with the police?

457
00:33:14,557 --> 00:33:16,857
I've trained the police.

458
00:33:17,158 --> 00:33:19,958
And what do all the belts mean?

459
00:33:19,959 --> 00:33:22,759
The white belt is someone who walks
in of the street.

460
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:25,960
The black belt is someone that the teacher
recognizes is fit to instruct.

461
00:33:25,961 --> 00:33:29,361
In between we have blue, purple and brown.

462
00:33:32,362 --> 00:33:34,962
What do you have to do,
to get a red belt?

463
00:33:34,963 --> 00:33:37,263
There is only one.

464
00:33:37,764 --> 00:33:41,264
All right, I'm not going to touch you.

465
00:33:42,965 --> 00:33:46,965
But if you would have hold me,
could I strike you?

466
00:33:46,966 --> 00:33:51,066
If you put your arms around me
and hold me, could I strike you?

467
00:33:51,367 --> 00:33:53,667
With your knees.

468
00:33:53,768 --> 00:33:57,468
If you turned your body slightly,
and grassed me

469
00:33:57,469 --> 00:34:01,169
could I strike you from there?

470
00:34:01,970 --> 00:34:05,170
No. No!
- What?

471
00:34:11,171 --> 00:34:15,171
Could I strike you now?
- No.

472
00:34:15,472 --> 00:34:17,972
Where can I strike you?

473
00:34:33,573 --> 00:34:35,973
Don't stand there.

474
00:34:40,274 --> 00:34:42,974
An enrollment form,

475
00:34:44,375 --> 00:34:47,475
if you wish to continue your instruction.

476
00:35:03,676 --> 00:35:05,676
Yeah.

477
00:35:05,677 --> 00:35:08,177
I am looking at cinaty 7-c,
I got it.

478
00:35:08,178 --> 00:35:11,178
Well, an office is good as a feast.

479
00:35:11,379 --> 00:35:13,579
Ok, let's take a walk.
Come on.

480
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:16,580
Excuse me, but I have to ask you.
Where did you get your dress?

481
00:35:16,581 --> 00:35:19,481
I made it.
- Oh, she made it.

482
00:35:19,482 --> 00:35:22,982
Oh, did you do your coat too?
Where did you get the fabric?

483
00:35:22,983 --> 00:35:24,683
The fabric?
I made that too.

484
00:35:24,684 --> 00:35:28,584
You made that?
- Yeah, since I was a kid in Rio.

485
00:35:28,685 --> 00:35:32,085
You made the fabric?
- Yeah, I have a company in Brazil.

486
00:35:32,086 --> 00:35:35,086
No, I don't believe it.
I just don't believe it.

487
00:35:35,087 --> 00:35:38,187
Come and sit down. Lucy and I just
wrote a book about fabrics.

488
00:35:38,188 --> 00:35:40,188
Really?
- Yes.

489
00:35:40,189 --> 00:35:43,389
We have a company.
She has her decrement in textiles.

490
00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:45,590
I love this fabric.

491
00:35:45,591 --> 00:35:48,291
I have some people,
my family's people in Brazil

492
00:35:48,292 --> 00:35:50,892
and their the ones that bring..
- I love this fabric.

493
00:35:50,893 --> 00:35:51,993
Really?
- Yes.

494
00:35:51,994 --> 00:35:54,594
I would love..
If you guys want, I can show you more..

495
00:35:54,595 --> 00:35:56,695
..I have tons of..
- Of course.

496
00:35:56,696 --> 00:35:58,696
So what is Ju-Jitsu?

497
00:35:58,697 --> 00:36:02,197
You use the fighters strength against him?

498
00:36:02,198 --> 00:36:04,198
Yes, in a way.

499
00:36:04,199 --> 00:36:08,299
You let him use his strength,
and you use your understanding.

500
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:10,600
So it's a form of wrestling?

501
00:36:10,701 --> 00:36:12,001
Yeah.

502
00:36:12,002 --> 00:36:15,402
Like we see in the mixed martial arts
competition? - Yeah, that's right.

503
00:36:15,403 --> 00:36:17,603
Do you compete?
- No.

504
00:36:17,604 --> 00:36:21,904
Because...?
- Competition is weakening.

505
00:36:22,805 --> 00:36:24,705
Because it's fixed.

506
00:36:24,706 --> 00:36:27,106
Two guys in the ring,
people betting money.

507
00:36:27,107 --> 00:36:30,707
Maybe fixed?
Anyone fight, maybe fixed.

508
00:36:31,908 --> 00:36:36,008
But you train people to fight.
- No, I train people to prevail.

509
00:36:37,009 --> 00:36:39,309
In the street, in the alley

510
00:36:39,310 --> 00:36:41,010
in combat.

511
00:36:41,011 --> 00:36:46,011
The bodyguard, the cop, the soldiers.
One rule, put the other guy down.

512
00:36:46,012 --> 00:36:48,712
Now, you have to train them
to do that and any..

513
00:36:48,713 --> 00:36:52,213
any staged contests must have rules.

514
00:36:52,214 --> 00:36:56,214
Everything has rules, the problem
is stick 'em to them.

515
00:36:58,815 --> 00:37:01,915
Your wife, she's a beautiful woman.

516
00:37:01,916 --> 00:37:04,716
Thank you.

517
00:37:07,617 --> 00:37:09,717
Yes, she is.

518
00:37:09,918 --> 00:37:14,718
Booz, women. What in this life
doesn't get you in trouble?

519
00:37:15,819 --> 00:37:20,319
Turn to the side.
Everything has a force.

520
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:24,520
Embrace it or deflect it.
Why oppose it?

521
00:37:27,221 --> 00:37:29,521
How you're doing?
You're healing up?

522
00:37:29,522 --> 00:37:33,322
I'm good.
- Well, you're young.

523
00:37:34,723 --> 00:37:39,823
So there's a neck-line, the waist-line
and the hem-line. Right?

524
00:37:39,824 --> 00:37:41,124
Right.

525
00:37:41,125 --> 00:37:46,025
So, if you bring the hem-line down
in this direction.

526
00:37:46,326 --> 00:37:49,626
It gives a better rhythm, right?
- Yeah.

527
00:37:49,627 --> 00:37:53,727
If you repeat and the fabric is..
..one foot. Let's say.

528
00:37:53,728 --> 00:37:55,828
Repeat at one foot?
That's too costly.

529
00:37:55,829 --> 00:37:58,629
That's what I'm saying.
Not from my people in Brazil.

530
00:37:58,630 --> 00:38:00,030
And you can get this fabric?

531
00:38:00,031 --> 00:38:03,131
Absolute, and make their fabric
and have it to you in a week.

532
00:38:03,732 --> 00:38:07,132
Yeah?
- He's got to be on the set in five hours.

533
00:38:07,433 --> 00:38:09,833
Let's let these nice people go home.

534
00:38:09,834 --> 00:38:12,834
Sure honey.
Two heroes to obey.

535
00:38:21,135 --> 00:38:24,135
Thanks, pal.
- You're welcome.

536
00:38:25,036 --> 00:38:28,436
Jerry, take care of that thing
for tomorrow morning. - You bet ya.

537
00:38:28,437 --> 00:38:31,737
Movies, we get up early in the morning
like in the military.

538
00:38:31,738 --> 00:38:35,038
You were in the military?
- Yes, I was.

539
00:38:36,739 --> 00:38:39,139
I've never seen Chet socialize on
a school night.

540
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:41,640
The guy saved his life.

541
00:38:42,541 --> 00:38:44,340
Zena.
- Thank you.

542
00:38:44,341 --> 00:38:49,041
Tomorrow, I want to see you tomorrow.
Those are all my numbers, right there.

543
00:38:50,442 --> 00:38:52,042
Mike.

544
00:38:53,243 --> 00:38:55,843
Mike, tell them the story.
Oh no, they want to go to bed.

545
00:38:55,844 --> 00:38:57,844
Come on, baby.
Tell them the story.

546
00:38:57,845 --> 00:39:00,545
The fight is before a fight.
- Three marbles.

547
00:39:00,546 --> 00:39:03,346
Each fighter has a two and three odds
of choosing the white marble.

548
00:39:03,347 --> 00:39:04,647
White marble is a pass.

549
00:39:04,648 --> 00:39:07,448
White marble is a pass?
What if he picks the black marble?

550
00:39:07,449 --> 00:39:10,249
Black marble is a handicap.
- What does that mean a handicap?

551
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:12,250
No, you lose the use of an arm or...

552
00:39:12,251 --> 00:39:15,151
Because you never know
when you maybe disabled.

553
00:39:15,152 --> 00:39:17,152
Thank you, for a beautiful evening.

554
00:39:17,153 --> 00:39:19,953
Thank you for having us
to your lovely home.

555
00:39:19,954 --> 00:39:23,954
In fact it's a handicap.
Do they do that in competitions?

556
00:39:23,955 --> 00:39:26,055
No.
- No? They should.

557
00:39:26,056 --> 00:39:30,256
A lot of money in that.
It will be like a reality show.

558
00:39:30,257 --> 00:39:34,457
Chet wants you to come down to the
set in the morning. Can you do that?

559
00:39:34,658 --> 00:39:36,658
Yeah, ok.

560
00:39:46,159 --> 00:39:48,359
Mike, over here.

561
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:50,760
Yeah, hold on.

562
00:39:50,761 --> 00:39:54,261
Chet is a little bit late.
He's a little bit late.

563
00:39:54,262 --> 00:39:56,662
What do we need to make you comfortable?
Abbey?

564
00:39:56,663 --> 00:39:58,463
Yes, Jerry?
- Give him a script.

565
00:39:58,464 --> 00:40:02,164
Put him in the trailer if he wants.
Chet is running late.

566
00:40:02,465 --> 00:40:04,765
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Abbey!

567
00:40:10,166 --> 00:40:13,766
Pay attention.
Will you pay attention?

568
00:40:13,767 --> 00:40:16,667
Come on. What you going to do,
stab me with your purse?

569
00:40:16,668 --> 00:40:18,468
Come on.

570
00:40:19,069 --> 00:40:21,269
No, no, no.
This is bullshit.

571
00:40:21,270 --> 00:40:23,870
You got to stab me with the fucking thing.
- I'm trying, George.

572
00:40:23,871 --> 00:40:26,071
Well, try harder.
Let's go!

573
00:40:26,072 --> 00:40:29,572
Come on.
Come on, stick me!

574
00:40:29,573 --> 00:40:32,573
Come on.
Come on.

575
00:40:32,774 --> 00:40:35,274
You got to make it real.

576
00:40:36,275 --> 00:40:37,675
You got to make it real.

577
00:40:37,676 --> 00:40:40,976
Are you listening to me?
Or am I talking to a fucking wall?

578
00:40:44,577 --> 00:40:47,677
Make it look real.
You got to make it look real.

579
00:40:47,678 --> 00:40:51,578
Chet is not going to look real,
if you don't make him look real.

580
00:40:51,579 --> 00:40:54,179
Anybody could do this fucking move.

581
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:57,080
You? Yeah, you.
- Me?

582
00:40:57,081 --> 00:40:59,881
I'm going to show him
how to do the fucking move.

583
00:40:59,882 --> 00:41:03,882
Take the knife. It's not going to hurt you.
It's rubber.

584
00:41:06,483 --> 00:41:08,583
Mike, what the fuck are you doing here?

585
00:41:08,584 --> 00:41:09,984
I don't know.
I got asked by Jerry Weiss.

586
00:41:09,985 --> 00:41:13,485
Are you coming on the show?
- No, it just got all wannabe.

587
00:41:13,486 --> 00:41:16,486
Did he ask if you're in the military?
- Yeah.

588
00:41:16,487 --> 00:41:20,487
Did you tell him what you did?
- No, he didn't ask.

589
00:41:21,688 --> 00:41:25,888
You take the fucking knife.
He's Chet. I am you.

590
00:41:25,989 --> 00:41:28,889
You take the fucking knife
and you...

591
00:41:30,590 --> 00:41:33,890
Well, what we have here is a wise guy.

592
00:42:08,791 --> 00:42:10,991
How the fuck are you?
- I'm good.

593
00:42:10,992 --> 00:42:13,392
I don't want to take up any of your time.
- No, fuck.

594
00:42:13,393 --> 00:42:15,793
We're shooting something else.
There's always something else to shoot.

595
00:42:15,794 --> 00:42:18,194
Step in my office.

596
00:42:20,095 --> 00:42:22,695
What are we shooting today?

597
00:42:23,470 --> 00:42:24,569
Meet me

598
00:42:24,570 --> 00:42:27,569
0- Dark-3080C.

599
00:42:27,570 --> 00:42:29,339
I never served.

600
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:30,639
I know I didn't miss anything.

601
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:32,270
What are you going to say?

602
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:34,340
But how would I know?

603
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:36,849
This fucking guy who locked out.
- Here you go, Chet.

604
00:42:39,150 --> 00:42:42,280
Yeah, I'm just a fucking guy who locked out.

605
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,860
I drink too much.

606
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:52,299
I fool around.

607
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:54,600
Do you know how hard it is
for a man to step out?

608
00:42:54,670 --> 00:42:56,070
A famous man.

609
00:42:56,570 --> 00:42:58,200
And who can you trust?

610
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:01,300
What were you doing in the bar?

611
00:43:01,910 --> 00:43:04,709
I wanted to get a drink.
- Why didn't you bring your protection?

612
00:43:06,810 --> 00:43:08,710
I wanted to get into a fight.

613
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:11,319
Why didn't you fight him then?
- I wanted to beat him.

614
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:14,749
What are you a psychiatrist?
- No, I'm a fighter.

615
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:17,059
If that isn’t strong enough,
you tell me.

616
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:17,859
Thanks.

617
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:20,829
What are we shooting today?
- Golf war flashback.

618
00:43:22,330 --> 00:43:23,730
That's right.

619
00:43:23,830 --> 00:43:25,420
It's not my department.

620
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:28,770
What are these numbers doing on my boot?

621
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:31,930
If the guy been at combat,
they would have been worn of.

622
00:43:31,970 --> 00:43:34,769
I mean the sizes would have worn of, right?
- It's not the sizes.

623
00:43:34,770 --> 00:43:36,260
No?


624
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:38,840
The guys in the desert,

625
00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:41,540
ink their numbers
in their platoon on their boots.

626
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:45,249
Anyway if their legs got blown off
or their bodies got blown apart,

627
00:43:45,250 --> 00:43:48,240
somebody in their platoon would know
who it was.

628
00:43:58,670 --> 00:44:00,030
0- Dark-30.

629
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:01,800
EOC.

630
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:04,600
What does EOC mean?
- Es on curb.

631
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:06,140
Es on curb.

632
00:44:07,010 --> 00:44:08,340
That's good.

633
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:12,110
But is that something a guy would say?
- He might.

634
00:44:12,145 --> 00:44:14,510
It's hold on me, world war II.

635
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:18,149
Maybe the guy learnt it from the guy.
He's good.

636
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:22,119
You're free tonight?
You, me and Jerry.

637
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:25,119
I want to meet over in Fiori's,
have to be raff.

638
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:29,820
I want to make you a co-producer
on this film.

639
00:44:33,430 --> 00:44:35,430
Yeah, hey this is Mike Terry.

640
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:38,730
Yeah, George Coreani asked me
to sent me some materials.

641
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:41,869
Yeah, I found it.
Do you want me to fax it to you?

642
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:45,979
Ok, I'm going to fax it. I going to have
dinner with Jerry and Chet tonight.

643
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:47,780
Yeah, ok.

644
00:44:49,850 --> 00:44:51,680
They want to put it in the movie.

645
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:53,640
They put what in the movie?

646
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:57,380
This desert storm is a bunch of combat...

647
00:44:57,460 --> 00:44:59,890
George is doing it.
George is doing the stunts.

648
00:44:59,930 --> 00:45:02,189
George is doing their stunts?
- Yeah.

649
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:06,799
And why they want you for?

650
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:09,000
They want me to be a producer.

651
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:11,909
What does that mean?

652
00:45:11,910 --> 00:45:14,500
To begin with,
they want to use my training idea.

653
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:17,310
Golf war, they training for hand to hand.

654
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:21,109
The captain in the film, he's training
the guys using my training methods.

655
00:45:24,620 --> 00:45:27,419
Two seconds.
Sondra Terry?

656
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:29,210
Lucy, hi.

657
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:31,719
Yes, yes.
I'll be right up.

658
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:33,729
Yeah, I'll bring you the sample.

659
00:45:33,830 --> 00:45:35,220
Ok, bye.

660
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:38,729
Sorry baby, you were saying?
- They want me to be the producer.

661
00:45:39,330 --> 00:45:42,230
I'm going to the set,
and then I am going to dinner with...

662
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:45,730
What?

663
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:47,560
What?

664
00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:50,330
Who's going to take the beginners class?

665
00:45:52,550 --> 00:45:55,340
Baby, let the wheel come around.

666
00:45:56,050 --> 00:45:57,545
Just let it come around.

667
00:45:57,580 --> 00:45:59,989
Sometimes you can just let
the wheel come around.

668
00:45:59,990 --> 00:46:03,089
I can't just cancel the class.
What kind of message does that sent?

669
00:46:03,090 --> 00:46:05,690
You made Joe a black belt.
Right?

670
00:46:05,830 --> 00:46:09,090
And so he is qualified to aprove
the honor of the academy.

671
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,590
Let him teach the class.

672
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:20,530
Let him teach the class.

673
00:46:23,031 --> 00:46:24,531
Ok.

674
00:46:25,750 --> 00:46:27,810
Let the wheel come around.

675
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:38,950
Good for you.

676
00:46:40,730 --> 00:46:42,250
I got to go.

677
00:46:43,330 --> 00:46:44,930
See you later, ok?

678
00:46:48,230 --> 00:46:50,260
Their going to take me in their company.

679
00:46:50,961 --> 00:46:52,361
Ciao.

680
00:46:57,540 --> 00:46:59,140
Yeah, this is Mike Terry.

681
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:02,180
Yeah, did you get the fax
that I just sent you?

682
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:06,579
Ok, good.
Yeah, I'm going through the whole script here.

683
00:47:08,690 --> 00:47:11,020
Yeah, it's all about authenticity.

684
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:13,080
Am I supposed to meditate?

685
00:48:13,590 --> 00:48:15,820
No, just...

686
00:48:16,290 --> 00:48:17,880
sit for a moment.

687
00:48:22,930 --> 00:48:24,330
All right.

688
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:29,900
I don't understand.

689
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:33,130
The first step is the hardest.
- And what is the first step?

690
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:35,300
To leave the outside, outside.

691
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:49,650
I think, I've come to the wrong place.

692
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:51,950
I'm so sorry.

693
00:48:52,530 --> 00:48:56,229
Conquer your fear and
you'll conquer your opponent.

694
00:48:57,730 --> 00:48:58,830
Yes.

695
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:02,560
Mr Terry,

696
00:49:03,270 --> 00:49:05,290
a man raped me.

697
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:07,909
He held a knife to my throat

698
00:49:07,910 --> 00:49:09,810
a man twice my size.

699
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:11,970
And then he raped me.

700
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:16,179
He held a knife to your throat?
- Yes, look I..

701
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:18,470
I appreciate what you have done,
it's just..

702
00:49:19,290 --> 00:49:23,580
I don't think there's anything
that I could learn here that would really...

703
00:49:23,590 --> 00:49:26,229
There is no situation
that you cannot escape from.

704
00:49:26,230 --> 00:49:30,429
There is no situation that you cannot
turn to your advantage.

705
00:49:30,430 --> 00:49:32,420
A man was going to cut my throat.

706
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:34,190
Like this?

707
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:36,739
Don't move. There's a knife there.

708
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:39,000
There's a knife there.
Grab my arm.

709
00:49:39,410 --> 00:49:40,809
Drag it toward me.

710
00:49:40,810 --> 00:49:42,909
Toward me.
- Good.

711
00:49:42,940 --> 00:49:45,339
Move to the right, move to the right
and behind me.

712
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:48,410
Move to the right and behind me.
Good, now stab me with the knife.

713
00:49:49,050 --> 00:49:50,850
Good, stab me with the knife.

714
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:53,010
Good, stab me with the knife.

715
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:54,620
Stab me with the knife.

716
00:49:54,820 --> 00:49:57,159
Let's hear it.
Let it out.

717
00:49:57,160 --> 00:50:00,060
Let it out.

718
00:50:16,940 --> 00:50:18,770
It's all right.

719
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:22,450
There's nobody here but the fighters.

720
00:50:24,950 --> 00:50:26,580
Yeah.

721
00:50:27,290 --> 00:50:29,340
Yeah, this is Mike Terry.

722
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:32,650
Yeah, I put that stuff together for you.

723
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:34,990
Yeah, well eh...

724
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:37,450
It is good.
Yeah.

725
00:50:38,260 --> 00:50:40,660
Yeah. No, I'm working on the script now.

726
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:42,690
Yeah.

727
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:44,570
Ok.
No, thank you.

728
00:50:44,670 --> 00:50:47,170
Hey Joe, thanks for coming in.

729
00:50:48,710 --> 00:50:52,180
I want you to take the evening class.
White belts.

730
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:57,110
Hit escape, escape the mount,
pass the board, arm ball.

731
00:51:00,420 --> 00:51:04,019
What time you go on your shift?
- I've been suspended.

732
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:07,450
The wristwatch was hot.

733
00:51:07,860 --> 00:51:09,559
The wristwatch?
- The gold watch.

734
00:51:09,630 --> 00:51:11,529
The guy gave you, you gave me.

735
00:51:11,530 --> 00:51:13,649
I pound it, it was hot.
- It was hot?

736
00:51:13,684 --> 00:51:15,769
Two dollar pistol.
- You pound it?

737
00:51:15,770 --> 00:51:16,630
I did.

738
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:18,369
The pound shop called it in.

739
00:51:18,370 --> 00:51:22,279
The captain wants to know what I am
doing with a hot $20.000 dollar watch.

740
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:24,079
What did you tell him?
- I told him..

741
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:26,840
I told him, I got to tell him tomorrow.

742
00:51:27,380 --> 00:51:28,870
He suspended me.

743
00:51:32,350 --> 00:51:34,550
You told him where you got the watch?

744
00:51:34,590 --> 00:51:36,150
I didn't want to hurt the academy.

745
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:38,889
I couldn't tell him you gave me a hot watch.

746
00:51:38,890 --> 00:51:41,260
No, no.
Let me clean it up, it's easy.

747
00:51:42,460 --> 00:51:43,990
It's easy.

748
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:45,659
It's easy?
- Yeah, these guys..

749
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:49,669
..these guys. I'm sure, the guy who gave
me the watch. He got stiffed, it's easy.

750
00:51:49,670 --> 00:51:52,469
I'm sure he want to know.
Take the class, sweat it out.

751
00:51:52,670 --> 00:51:53,870
Sweat it out.

752
00:51:53,970 --> 00:51:56,870
It's ok, Joe.
It's easy.

753
00:52:19,030 --> 00:52:20,560
Sorry, I'm late.

754
00:52:21,730 --> 00:52:25,339
Chet might be shooting till down.
If he raps early, he will come down.

755
00:52:25,340 --> 00:52:27,039
He sent his regrets.

756
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:29,570
Here's what he wanted to talk to you about.

757
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:33,739
And you should get a lawyer because he wants
to make a business arrangement with you.

758
00:52:33,750 --> 00:52:36,949
He's got some big ideas.
Some of them might be even be mine.

759
00:52:37,450 --> 00:52:40,479
Here's one of them.
This could be money.

760
00:52:41,850 --> 00:52:43,919
What would you like to drink?
Wine?

761
00:52:43,954 --> 00:52:46,206
No, I'm good.
- You don't drink?

762
00:52:46,241 --> 00:52:48,459
I used to.
- You don't anymore?

763
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:50,890
Jerry.

764
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:55,260
There's a problem and
I need you to help me to work it out.

765
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:56,799
Of course.

766
00:52:57,100 --> 00:52:59,669
It's eh...
Its difficult for me to say.

767
00:52:59,704 --> 00:53:02,100
That's way I know.
Spit it out.

768
00:53:02,340 --> 00:53:04,600
Chet gave me a lavish gift.

769
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:06,509
A lavish gift.
- All right.

770
00:53:06,510 --> 00:53:09,209
There was a money issue and
I asked a friend of mine to pound it.

771
00:53:09,210 --> 00:53:11,750
To pound it?
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

772
00:53:12,820 --> 00:53:16,240
Chet sends you a wristwatch
and you pound it?

773
00:53:16,275 --> 00:53:17,620
Hey, look...

774
00:53:17,860 --> 00:53:20,720
He gave it to you. It's yours to
do with it as you want.

775
00:53:20,730 --> 00:53:22,959
Hey.
- How you're doing?

776
00:53:23,030 --> 00:53:24,220
You got a minute?

777
00:53:24,430 --> 00:53:26,359
I catch up with you.
- I got something, I think Chet might like.

778
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:28,660
Well, I'm coming right over.
- I'm going to call you about it.

779
00:53:28,740 --> 00:53:29,860
Ok.

780
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:35,039
Somebody pound the watch
that Chet gave you?

781
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:37,330
And he was told the watch was stolen.
- Stolen?

782
00:53:37,331 --> 00:53:38,331
Yeah.

783
00:53:38,850 --> 00:53:40,380
Son of a bitch.

784
00:53:40,450 --> 00:53:42,380
Some motherfucker sold..

785
00:53:42,950 --> 00:53:46,149
Someone sold Chet Frank a hot watch.

786
00:53:46,150 --> 00:53:48,850
I can't use the cell phone in here.

787
00:53:48,851 --> 00:53:52,089
I'm going to use the phone in the front.
I'm going to clean this up right now.

788
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:41,930
But she gave me this number.

789
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:45,070
Mrs. Frank gave me this number.

790
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:48,149
I called the other number
and it's out of service.

791
00:54:49,350 --> 00:54:50,850
It's out of service.

792
00:54:52,150 --> 00:54:53,415
Thanks.

793
00:54:53,450 --> 00:54:55,640
Their numbers are all out of service.

794
00:54:57,560 --> 00:54:59,989
How come it's out of service
if they gave it to me yesterday?

795
00:55:00,024 --> 00:55:01,629
Who?
- Zena Frank.

796
00:55:01,690 --> 00:55:03,420
I had a meeting with Jerry.

797
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:06,200
They've changed the number.

798
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:09,799
I've ordered $30.000 dollar of the fabric.

799
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:12,939
I placed an order to Brazil for
$30.000 dollar of the fabric.

800
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:14,630
Lucy Wise, please.

801
00:55:16,310 --> 00:55:18,610
She's on vacation?

802
00:55:21,210 --> 00:55:23,110
She won't take my call.

803
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:25,019
I had a meeting with Jerry.

804
00:55:25,020 --> 00:55:26,449
What did you do to screw this up?

805
00:55:26,650 --> 00:55:29,549
You placed an order to Brazil.
- What did you do to make them act this way?

806
00:55:29,584 --> 00:55:31,619
You placed an order to Brazil
for $30.000 dollar.

807
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:33,029
Yes.
- Why?

808
00:55:33,030 --> 00:55:34,929
Zena told me it was a done deal.

809
00:55:35,030 --> 00:55:36,959
Their were going to use
my fabric in their shop.

810
00:55:37,060 --> 00:55:38,450
Where did you get the credit?

811
00:55:38,660 --> 00:55:41,829
What?
- Where did you get $30.000 dollar credit?

812
00:55:41,930 --> 00:55:42,869
I paid cash.

813
00:55:42,870 --> 00:55:44,569
What?
- I paid cash.

814
00:55:44,570 --> 00:55:47,039
Are you deaf?
Do you know what's happening to my life, Mike?

815
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:48,340
Where did you get the cash?

816
00:55:48,740 --> 00:55:51,139
I took out a personal loan for two weeks.

817
00:55:51,140 --> 00:55:52,479
I was going to get the fabric..

818
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:53,479
We...

819
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:56,249
I was going to be a part of their company.

820
00:55:56,350 --> 00:55:58,180
You took out a personal loan

821
00:55:58,250 --> 00:56:01,619
for $30.000 dollar for two weeks.
From whom?

822
00:56:01,690 --> 00:56:03,419
It was a done deal.

823
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:04,880
Yes, but now it's not a done deal.

824
00:56:04,890 --> 00:56:06,989
I wasn't even going to need it
for two weeks, Mike.

825
00:56:06,990 --> 00:56:08,529
They told me, they were writing their cheque.

826
00:56:08,530 --> 00:56:11,129
Who gave you the loan?

827
00:56:11,130 --> 00:56:12,800
Richard gave me the loan.

828
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:20,600
You borrowed $30.0000 dollar
from a loan shop?

829
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:24,110
Are you crazy?

830
00:56:33,220 --> 00:56:34,619
She spent it.

831
00:56:34,620 --> 00:56:36,020
She spent it?

832
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:38,150
She spent the $30.000 dollar I gave her.
- That's right.

833
00:56:38,260 --> 00:56:40,750
She said she wanted
the money for two weeks.

834
00:56:41,430 --> 00:56:42,559
She spent it.

835
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:44,650
What the fuck am I going to do?

836
00:56:48,230 --> 00:56:49,670
What can you give me?

837
00:56:51,140 --> 00:56:52,730
How soon could you get it to me?

838
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:54,069
Richie.

839
00:56:54,070 --> 00:56:55,630
If you could carry me?

840
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:56,679
The money isn’t mine, Mike.

841
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:58,079
The money isn’t mine...

842
00:56:58,080 --> 00:57:01,209
I gave it out of my word. But I owe
that money to my guys, you understand?

843
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:02,870
It isn’t mine.

844
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:08,490
What do you own that you could turn to cash?
What do you got what you could liquidate?

845
00:57:09,890 --> 00:57:11,480
Something for you?

846
00:57:11,790 --> 00:57:15,829
<i>It's an Asian-samurai training technique
going back to the 17th century.</i>

847
00:57:15,864 --> 00:57:17,429
<i>Every fighter in the tournament,</i>

848
00:57:17,430 --> 00:57:20,490
<i>each match, each fighter
will pick a marble.</i>

849
00:57:20,491 --> 00:57:22,991
<i>Should he pick a white marble,
he'll be giving a pass.</i>

850
00:57:23,700 --> 00:57:27,299
<i>Should he pick a black marble,
he'll be given a handicap.</i>

851
00:57:27,310 --> 00:57:30,709
<i>So the fighters on the Undercard, each one
could get a handicap? - That's right.</i>

852
00:57:30,744 --> 00:57:31,909
<i>The samurai say that's this..</i>

853
00:57:33,610 --> 00:57:35,610
What do you got what's worth money?

854
00:57:35,620 --> 00:57:39,210
<i>..where one can never tell
if they might become disabled.</i>

855
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:41,819
<i>So there you have the Under card,
in the main event we have bad blood..</i>

856
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:44,920
<i>evidentially between Morisaki and your
brother Ricardo Silva.</i>

857
00:57:44,922 --> 00:57:47,929
<i>Morisaki feels like he's been insulted.
- That is correct, it is.</i>

858
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:52,659
<i>Unfortunate, but this competition has start into
a grouch match between my brother and Morisaki.</i>

859
00:57:52,970 --> 00:57:54,829
Under the laws of intellectual property,

860
00:57:54,930 --> 00:57:56,239
the copyright

861
00:57:56,240 --> 00:58:02,769
that is the possession of the idea and all
profits from its exploitation belongs to Mr. Terry.

862
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:04,409
The three marbles.

863
00:58:04,510 --> 00:58:06,079
You can't copyright an idea?

864
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:09,279
You can't copyright an idea but you can
copyright a particular expression,

865
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:12,519
which my client has done through use
to exploitation of his system

866
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:14,089
in order to earn his living.

867
00:58:14,090 --> 00:58:15,189
Into historical form.

868
00:58:15,190 --> 00:58:17,289
Which idea...
- It's a historical form.

869
00:58:17,290 --> 00:58:19,389
It's not a historical form. That's nonsense.
- The Japanese..

870
00:58:19,390 --> 00:58:22,789
The idea was discovered in a Japanese
training manual of the 19th century.

871
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:25,729
You show it to me in one historical document,
we'll pack up and go home.

872
00:58:25,730 --> 00:58:27,999
And you show me were your client
never transcribed ancient...

873
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:32,099
He has a document of his training regime
that he used for many years in his academy.

874
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:34,775
So he says,
and I'll give you that.

875
00:58:34,810 --> 00:58:37,339
Who has ever seen this form
outside of his academy?

876
00:58:37,340 --> 00:58:39,849
We can assume that the Silva's
and your client had access.

877
00:58:40,050 --> 00:58:42,309
The presumption of access.
- You can assume whatever you want.

878
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:46,419
I believe the courts will conquer the
relationship between the parties being so close.

879
00:58:46,620 --> 00:58:49,549
Is that your case?
Is that you want to roll the dice on?

880
00:58:49,820 --> 00:58:51,519
Are you sure you want to play in this league?

881
00:58:51,620 --> 00:58:54,819
What do they want?
Let's financesialize the problem.

882
00:58:57,560 --> 00:58:59,335
No, no.

883
00:58:59,370 --> 00:59:01,350
Please ask him to wait.

884
00:59:02,770 --> 00:59:04,170
However...

885
00:59:04,270 --> 00:59:07,000
My client is prepared to relinquish.

886
00:59:07,010 --> 00:59:08,300
Today.

887
00:59:08,470 --> 00:59:10,910
To relinquish all rights to his creation.

888
00:59:11,110 --> 00:59:14,879
In return for what?
- In return for a payment of $200.000 dollar.

889
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:17,279
Payable today.
- That's a lot of money.

890
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:19,279
It's a great idea.
- It's a good idea.

891
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:21,880
It's a great idea or why would
you promoting it?

892
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:26,590
No, ask him to wait.

893
00:59:27,530 --> 00:59:28,920
He's got to wait.

894
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:31,390
Your name could be here.

895
00:59:33,930 --> 00:59:37,829
You want to make some money?
Fight on the under card. $50.000 dollar.

896
00:59:38,100 --> 00:59:41,099
I saw you fight.
You've got a month to train.

897
00:59:41,110 --> 00:59:44,030
You want to make some money?
Give me a call.

898
00:59:44,210 --> 00:59:45,610
I will make you some money.

899
00:59:46,210 --> 00:59:50,409
Thank you that is very generous.
Today we need a cash payment of $200.000 dollar.

900
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:52,119
You can't go in there.
- You know, I don't think so.

901
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:56,419
Mr. Brown, I tried to stop him.
- It's ok, it's your new partner.

902
01:00:00,230 --> 01:00:04,829
It's Jerry Weiss, the producer.
I faxed him a copy of the train sheet.

903
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:13,439
It's a conspiracy.
You gave the one guy the information.

904
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:15,969
Who gave it to the other guy.
Who denied it.

905
01:00:15,970 --> 01:00:20,179
As A: It's theft.
B: It's conspiracy to fraud.

906
01:00:20,350 --> 01:00:23,549
You want to get cute? You threatening
with criminal prosecution into recon.

907
01:00:23,550 --> 01:00:26,880
I'm glad I caught you.
- You are about to become a wealthy man.

908
01:00:27,150 --> 01:00:30,649
You just blew your case back there, didn't you?
- If I can have just one moment.

909
01:00:30,660 --> 01:00:33,659
I will need some time to formulate
our new demands. - Of course.

910
01:00:33,660 --> 01:00:35,550
But I want to show you something.

911
01:00:35,560 --> 01:00:38,399
Joseph Collins.
Los Angeles police.

912
01:00:38,460 --> 01:00:41,469
On the night of June 12th,
you stole his weapon and fired on him.

913
01:00:41,470 --> 01:00:43,799
Here is the ejected shell from his pistol.

914
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:46,270
It has your fingerprints on it.

915
01:00:47,110 --> 01:00:49,969
Officer Collins did not file a report,
he's then also prosecutable

916
01:00:49,970 --> 01:00:51,770
and we will see to it that he is prosecuted.

917
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:52,809
Prosecuted for?

918
01:00:52,810 --> 01:00:55,210
He was witness to the attempted murder
on a police officer.

919
01:00:55,211 --> 01:00:56,219
Oh, please.

920
01:00:56,220 --> 01:00:57,679
Which he suppressed.
- Why would he do that?

921
01:00:57,680 --> 01:00:59,620
In exchange for a bribe.
- A bribe?.

922
01:00:59,621 --> 01:01:01,421
This will of course end his career with the
police department,

923
01:01:01,422 --> 01:01:04,322
and sent him as well as the person
who suborned him to jail.

924
01:01:04,460 --> 01:01:05,950
Along with the assailant.

925
01:01:06,030 --> 01:01:06,829
A bribe?

926
01:01:06,830 --> 01:01:10,250
Your client gave him a wristwatch,
worth $20.000 dollar.

927
01:01:10,285 --> 01:01:12,320
In exchange for his silence.

928
01:01:12,770 --> 01:01:15,229
I contacted the officer and shared with
him the alternatives.

929
01:01:15,230 --> 01:01:19,239
You withdraw your claim, or we will suspender him
and force him to incriminate you and Mr. Terry.

930
01:01:19,240 --> 01:01:21,569
For, which he understands,
you'll both stand trial.

931
01:01:21,570 --> 01:01:23,140
How would you like to proceed?

932
01:01:24,940 --> 01:01:27,340
I like to proceed directly to court.

933
01:01:28,650 --> 01:01:31,640
From the academy I'll need all your notebooks
and journals from day one.

934
01:01:31,850 --> 01:01:33,380
Thank you for your time.

935
01:01:33,650 --> 01:01:35,940
Speak to nobody about this case
from now on.

936
01:02:04,020 --> 01:02:06,850
You motherfucking son of a bitch.

937
01:02:07,350 --> 01:02:10,419
What have I got?
What have I got? Nothing.

938
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:15,359
Nothing. Do you know what the pension is
for an officer who kills himself?

939
01:02:15,860 --> 01:02:19,359
What is the pension of a suicide?

940
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:20,929
Do you know?

941
01:02:20,930 --> 01:02:24,029
It's nothing.
Tell him.

942
01:02:26,470 --> 01:02:28,130
Please don't touch that...

943
01:02:28,140 --> 01:02:31,570
He didn't want to bring disgrace on you.

944
01:02:31,740 --> 01:02:34,640
I have no husband.

945
01:02:34,750 --> 01:02:38,149
I have no husband, I can't pay my bills.

946
01:02:38,180 --> 01:02:42,289
I can't pay my rent.
And now I don't have even have his pension.

947
01:02:42,324 --> 01:02:47,359
And for what? For what?
For your stupid principles?

948
01:02:47,394 --> 01:02:52,590
You are a sick fool.
How am I going to live?

949
01:02:53,300 --> 01:02:57,099
Who's going to pay these bills?
Are you?

950
01:02:57,170 --> 01:03:01,800
Are you?
Are you going to take care of me?

951
01:03:01,801 --> 01:03:03,801
I need you to step outside now.

952
01:03:04,802 --> 01:03:06,602
How about that?

953
01:05:25,850 --> 01:05:29,520
Ok, copies of state regulation signed.

954
01:05:29,820 --> 01:05:34,429
All right, we want to get the main on,
if possible by 11.00 pm.

955
01:05:34,430 --> 01:05:38,429
First elimination Romero and Sanches.

956
01:05:38,630 --> 01:05:41,830

957
01:05:41,930 --> 01:05:44,330
The winner goes on to the second round.

958
01:05:45,840 --> 01:05:49,740
All right, it's new but it's
fairly straight forward.

959
01:05:50,140 --> 01:05:54,539
As your match is called,
you will be walked to the ring.

960
01:05:54,650 --> 01:05:58,870
We will now go to the ring then I will
release you to the Undercard room.

961
01:05:59,150 --> 01:06:04,520
Nobody is allowed in the Undercard room,
but fighters and trainers.

01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:18,239
So you'll take your corner.

966
01:06:18,340 --> 01:06:20,600
The referee will call you out.

967
01:06:20,710 --> 01:06:23,940
And an official will perform the ceremony.

968
01:06:24,710 --> 01:06:27,809
The efficient,
he will be wearing this mask,

969
01:06:27,810 --> 01:06:30,110
will show the bowl.

970
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:33,610
He will show the bowl and the marbles.

971
01:06:33,611 --> 01:06:36,811
He will then raise the bowl
and you will choose.

972
01:06:37,120 --> 01:06:39,720
Black is the handicap.

973
01:06:40,530 --> 01:06:43,860

01:06:47,630 --> 01:06:49,330
Right arm bound.

977
01:06:57,580 --> 01:07:02,309
Ok. If you have no questions, make your
way back to the Undercard room.

978
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,320
The spirit and honor of the samurai.

979
01:07:23,500 --> 01:07:26,300
For those who it is a life style.

980
01:07:26,410 --> 01:07:28,900
Good, good, good.

981

01:07:42,350 --> 01:07:46,310
While the fighters are in the ring, they will
be under the direct supervision of the referee.

984
01:07:46,530 --> 01:07:48,929
Any judgment made will be final.

985
01:07:48,930 --> 01:07:53,259
subject only to disqualification
pending a drug test.

986
01:07:54,370 --> 01:07:58,130
Trainers, I want to see those credentials
and I want to see them signed.

987
01:08:00,970 --> 01:08:04,370
According to the law, it is a legal procedure.

988
01:08:04,510 --> 01:08:09,370
Signifying your acceptance of the rules
under the statutes of the state of California.

989
01:08:09,780 --> 01:08:15,880
First up Sanchez and Romero.
First fight Sanchez and Romero.

990
01:08:16,620 --> 01:08:20,889
And Dillon here is explaining what the
three possible handicaps could be.

991
01:08:20,890 --> 01:08:22,289
What are they?
Break em down for us.

992
01:08:22,390 --> 01:08:25,929
The basically draw from the bowl, a black
or two white marbles.

993
01:08:25,930 --> 01:08:28,069
if you get a white marble,
you basically getting a pass.

994
01:08:28,070 --> 01:08:31,099
If you draw the black marble, you're either
going to have one arm tied to your body

995
01:08:31,100 --> 01:08:33,100
or potentially both arms tied to your body.

996
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:36,339
Or the application of a blindfold.
- Fighting with a blindfold?

997
01:08:36,410 --> 01:08:38,939
Yeah, how's that sound?
- That sounds like fun.

998
01:08:38,940 --> 01:08:42,000
Well, it's going to be fun for the
audience tonight. Tell me something more...

Great to be here tonight in this
explosion of mixed martial arts.

1000
01:09:37,602 --> 01:09:38,902
It's unbelievable.

1001
01:09:38,903 --> 01:09:41,603
Why do you think this sport
is so popular in America?

1002
01:09:58,020 --> 01:09:59,920
Let's go on.

1003
01:10:02,160 --> 01:10:04,690
Who are that back there?

Do you have your mouth piece?
Do you have your mouth piece? All right.

1005
01:10:33,492 --> 01:10:37,592
Do you have your mouth piece?
Ok.

1006
01:11:37,260 --> 01:11:39,950
Yeah, ok.
Just take it easy.

You got instructions in the dressing room.
Do you have any questions?

1012
01:12:51,860 --> 01:12:55,650
Fight hard, fight free and fight fair.
Ok, touch gloves.

1013
01:12:55,751 --> 01:12:57,651
To your corners.

Ok, here we go.

1015

While the fighters are in the ring, they will
be under the disgracing of the referee.

1032
01:15:47,170 --> 01:15:51,339

1033
01:15:51,480 --> 01:15:52,839

Excuse me, you can't smoke here.

1047
01:16:59,280 --> 01:17:01,579
Well. I don't know about you Eddy,
but I love it.

1048
01:17:01,580 --> 01:17:05,019
I think boxing is as dead at Woodrow Wilson.
- What a fight...

1049
01:17:05,020 --> 01:17:07,980
I've got eyes on the fighters.
Their walking.

1050
01:17:08,720 --> 01:17:09,989
Ok, handlers.

1051
01:17:09,990 --> 01:17:14,080
Keep a hand on your boy, keep your eyes on me.
You know the drill.

1052
01:17:14,130 --> 01:17:16,780
We've been to this before,
let's go.

1053
01:17:16,900 --> 01:17:19,129
We'll be under here for about 15 minutes.

1054
01:17:19,530 --> 01:17:22,330
Then the man will come through to
take you to the ring.

1055
01:17:22,331 --> 01:17:25,000
When you get to the ring,
listen to the referee.

1056
01:17:25,501 --> 01:17:27,001
Sorry.

1057
01:17:27,240 --> 01:17:30,200
I'm handing him of,
I'm coming up now under the bleachers.

1058
01:17:30,240 --> 01:17:33,639
The under card, what did we just see
in the first event?

1059
01:17:33,640 --> 01:17:36,200
Here's what we saw,
here's what the I.F.A has done...

1060
01:17:36,401 --> 01:17:38,701
Eyes on the price, Mike.

1061
01:17:39,002 --> 01:17:40,702
This is your road game.

1062
01:17:41,703 --> 01:17:43,403
<i>There's Mike Terry, an unknown.</i>

1063
01:17:43,404 --> 01:17:46,420
<i>Hey Mike, you saw the fight.
What do you think of this new competition?</i>

1064
01:17:46,421 --> 01:17:49,421
<i>One guy is ahead, how that would affect
you as a fighter?</i>

1065
01:17:49,622 --> 01:17:51,229
After the fight.

1066
01:17:51,230 --> 01:17:53,030
Leave my guy alone.

1067
01:18:00,510 --> 01:18:04,900
Goddamned shame, Mike.
Goddamned shame about Joey.

1068
01:18:05,480 --> 01:18:06,970
He was my companion, Mike.

1069
01:18:12,371 --> 01:18:16,771
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, we have a very
special guest with us tonight.</i>

1070
01:18:17,572 --> 01:18:20,772
<i>From Sao Paolo, Brazil.</i>

1071
01:18:20,890 --> 01:18:23,820
<i>The red belt himself.</i>

1072
01:18:23,900 --> 01:18:27,290
<i>The professor, the grandmaster.</i>

1073
01:18:27,500 --> 01:18:30,590
<i>Joao Moro.</i>

1074
01:18:47,291 --> 01:18:50,991
You, the fighter.
Back up. Back up.

1075
01:18:51,092 --> 01:18:55,692
Back up. Get out of the way,
I need some room. Back it up.

1076
01:19:38,500 --> 01:19:41,499
It's fixed.
- The fight is fixed?

1077
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:44,539
Of course it's fixed.
What the fuck do you think?

1078
01:19:56,420 --> 01:19:57,759
What do you want?

1079
01:19:57,760 --> 01:20:02,919
You brought the old man,
up from Brazil for this bullshit?

1080
01:20:03,230 --> 01:20:05,250
You run your business,
I run mine.

1081
01:20:05,630 --> 01:20:08,260
Who I brought to wear is of no
concern to you.

1082
01:20:08,530 --> 01:20:11,969
His life, his teachings.
- What do you know of his teachings?

1083
01:20:12,040 --> 01:20:14,040
What the hell do you know of his teachings?

1084
01:20:16,140 --> 01:20:17,939
It's my family business,

1085
01:20:17,940 --> 01:20:19,539
and it is a business, ok?

1086
01:20:19,540 --> 01:20:21,340
What the hell did you think it is?

1087
01:20:21,850 --> 01:20:23,640
There's television out there.

1088
01:20:23,680 --> 01:20:27,840
It's about to be big business.
And nobody has forgotten you.

1089
01:20:27,950 --> 01:20:30,050
So cool down and sit down.

1090
01:20:30,660 --> 01:20:32,659
None of the fighters know that
the fight is fixed.

1091
01:20:32,860 --> 01:20:34,890
You weren't suppose to know.

1092
01:20:35,260 --> 01:20:37,059
You weren't suppose to know.
- I don't get it?

1093
01:20:37,060 --> 01:20:39,550
We pick who get's the white marble.

1094
01:20:39,760 --> 01:20:42,060
Here's what you missing.
Here's what you invented.

1095
01:20:42,070 --> 01:20:45,700
The thing, it's not a way to insure
the fight is fair.

1096
01:20:45,970 --> 01:20:48,969
Any two guys fighting for money,
no way the fight is fair.

1097
01:20:48,970 --> 01:20:52,170
What you did is a way to fix the fight
without the fighters knowledge.

1098
01:20:52,710 --> 01:20:54,209
You stole my idea.

1099
01:20:54,210 --> 01:20:56,509
How about that?
So, look what?

1100
01:20:56,580 --> 01:20:58,279
Who gets the pass tonight?
You.

1101
01:20:58,280 --> 01:21:01,310
Every fight tonight,
the other guy gets the handicap.

1102
01:21:01,420 --> 01:21:04,919
You win, you go home with $50.000 dollar.
You settle your various debts.

1103
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:08,119
How about that?
Make a name for yourself.

1104
01:21:08,460 --> 01:21:10,629
I love a fighter.
What the fuck?

1105
01:21:10,630 --> 01:21:13,359
All right. All right.
Ricardo has got to rest.

1106
01:21:13,360 --> 01:21:14,529
Hold on?
- Are we done?

1107
01:21:14,530 --> 01:21:16,320
And? And?
- Are we done?

1108
01:21:16,530 --> 01:21:18,730
You come back in three months
for the re-match.

1109
01:21:18,740 --> 01:21:21,830
Ricardo fights Morisaki to re-take the crown.

1110
01:21:23,880 --> 01:21:25,605
You're throwing the fight tonight?

1111
01:21:25,640 --> 01:21:28,230
Everything in life,
the money is in the re-match.

1112
01:21:28,250 --> 01:21:29,940
Have you told him, he wins tonight?

1113
01:21:32,550 --> 01:21:35,250
You throw the fight in front of the professor?

1114
01:21:35,450 --> 01:21:37,440
The professor know the man.

1115
01:21:37,960 --> 01:21:40,050
And he doesn't have a family to support.

1116
01:21:40,060 --> 01:21:41,780
<i>Terry, Terry.</i>

1117
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:45,399
<i>15 minute warning on deck.</i>

1118
01:21:45,400 --> 01:21:48,060
<i>15 minute warning.</i>

1119
01:21:57,480 --> 01:21:59,370
A cop died.

1120
01:21:59,510 --> 01:22:02,210
Everybody dies.
You want to help his widow?

1121
01:22:08,350 --> 01:22:10,050
What about the stolen watch?

1122
01:22:10,760 --> 01:22:13,620
My friend shot himself because somebody
gave me a hot watch.

1123
01:22:13,621 --> 01:22:15,629
A fellow sold me a watch,
I got a deal on a watch.

1124
01:22:15,730 --> 01:22:17,920
How do I know where it came from?
I gave it to you.

1125
01:22:18,130 --> 01:22:20,429
Terry,
is he fighting or you want to call the fight?

1126
01:22:20,430 --> 01:22:23,560
What kind of stupid motherfucker pounds
a watch he got from Chet Frank?

1127
01:22:29,640 --> 01:22:32,039
How did you know how the window got broke?
- That isn't important.

1128
01:22:32,040 --> 01:22:33,340
No, no, no.
We were the only ones there.

1129
01:22:33,375 --> 01:22:34,379
Leave it, Mike.

1130
01:22:34,380 --> 01:22:37,570
A guy killed himself because a window
got broke. How did you know about the window?

1131
01:22:38,350 --> 01:22:40,480
Your wife sold you out.

1132
01:22:43,350 --> 01:22:46,759
Well, who did you think you married?

1133
01:22:48,290 --> 01:22:50,860
A Brazilian princess married the soldier.

1134
01:22:51,060 --> 01:22:53,660
5 years and the soldier is pumping gaps.

1135
01:22:54,100 --> 01:22:55,760
The smart girl is going to move on.

1136
01:22:55,770 --> 01:22:58,460
Your fight, or I am calling the fight
and your out.

1137
01:23:02,210 --> 01:23:05,400
Either way Mike, sometimes you
got to do business.

1138
01:23:06,410 --> 01:23:08,340
Pack it up, I'm going home.

1139
01:24:47,650 --> 01:24:49,570
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

1140
01:24:49,680 --> 01:24:52,379
<i>on the under card there is a substitution.</i>

1141
01:24:52,380 --> 01:24:55,480
<i>Our next fight a substitution.</i>

1142
01:24:56,190 --> 01:24:59,155
<i>Juan Toro Gracia.</i>

1143
01:24:59,190 --> 01:25:02,490
<i>And fighting in place of Mike Terry.</i>

1144
01:25:02,790 --> 01:25:06,190
<i>Steve "Moose" Malorin.</i>

1145
01:25:06,500 --> 01:25:12,300
<i>Steve "Moose" Malorin will fight
Juan Toro Garcia.</i>

1146
01:25:12,440 --> 01:25:18,809
But Jiu-Jitsu can, if all else goes wrong,
give you the ability to turn the fight around.

1147
01:25:18,810 --> 01:25:21,640
And turn the fight around is exactly
what we saw here tonight.

1148
01:25:21,710 --> 01:25:23,949
Teacher breaks up two boys
fighting in the schoolyard

1149
01:25:23,950 --> 01:25:25,619
ask to one boy, do you like to fight?

1150
01:25:25,620 --> 01:25:26,949
He said no, I like to win.

1151
01:25:27,250 --> 01:25:29,940
Well. After all, Dillon.
Isn't that what it is all about?

1152
01:25:30,020 --> 01:25:32,510
And that's why we're
here at the I.F.A tonight.

1153
01:25:33,620 --> 01:25:36,620
Are we out?
- Thanks.

1154
01:25:37,021 --> 01:25:38,821
Do you want me to take your microphone?

1155
01:25:38,860 --> 01:25:40,830
I'll see you at ringside in five minutes.

1156
01:25:45,170 --> 01:25:46,930
Mr. Flint?

1157
01:25:47,670 --> 01:25:50,030
Hey, hold on.
- Mr. Flint?

1158
01:25:50,540 --> 01:25:51,940
Mr. Flint?

1159
01:25:51,941 --> 01:25:53,870
Hey, stop him.
Stop him.

1160
01:25:53,871 --> 01:25:56,671
Hey, you quit.
- Mr. Flint?

1161
01:25:57,980 --> 01:25:59,870
Mr. Flint, I need to talk to you?

1162
01:26:03,290 --> 01:26:04,620
Mr. Flint?

1163
01:26:04,790 --> 01:26:07,690
Mike, Mike.
- I need to talk to you.

1164
01:26:07,691 --> 01:26:09,290
Stop him.

1165
01:26:09,590 --> 01:26:12,790
Will somebody stop him?
- Mr. Flint, I need to tell you something.

1166
01:26:19,591 --> 01:26:21,791
Will somebody stop him?

1167
01:26:23,192 --> 01:26:25,292
What's wrong with you?
- Mr. Flint?

1168
01:26:25,310 --> 01:26:27,609
You want to fight?
Why you don't go to the fucking ring?

1169
01:26:27,740 --> 01:26:29,140
Just a moment.

1170
01:26:30,441 --> 01:26:33,341
What do you do?
- Mike, you hear me?

1171
01:26:33,420 --> 01:26:36,410
I am going to rip it open.
- Oh, you going to fucking rip it open?

1172
01:26:36,450 --> 01:26:38,120
All right, great.

1173
01:26:43,030 --> 01:26:45,029
You think you're going to the ring?
Yeah?

1174
01:26:45,030 --> 01:26:47,929
You are going nowhere, Mike.
You are going nowhere.

1175
01:26:47,930 --> 01:26:51,029
You see?
You are going nowhere.

1176
01:26:51,730 --> 01:26:55,230
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.
That's right. That's right.

1177
01:26:55,431 --> 01:26:58,231
Fuck him up.
Fuck him up!

1178
01:27:12,820 --> 01:27:15,020
I'm ending this charade.

1179
01:27:40,720 --> 01:27:42,340
I'm going to the ring.

1180
01:27:43,650 --> 01:27:46,050
You're going to the ring,
to do what?

1181
01:27:46,060 --> 01:27:47,619
To do what,
to ruin my business?

1182
01:27:47,620 --> 01:27:48,429
That's right.

1183
01:27:48,430 --> 01:27:51,329
I prefer you didn't do that.
- I understand that.

1184
01:27:51,530 --> 01:27:55,759
You know, my sister was wrong.
You were wrong.

1185
01:27:55,770 --> 01:27:57,430
You know what you are?

1186
01:27:57,670 --> 01:28:00,970
You're addicted to poverty.
- I'm going to the ring.

1187
01:28:01,470 --> 01:28:07,360
I'm talking to you.
Ok, you want to play?

1188
01:28:11,080 --> 01:28:12,610
Let's do this thing.

1189
01:28:14,790 --> 01:28:16,520
Let's play the game.

1190
01:28:20,990 --> 01:28:24,799
A relatively new sport, it's only been
here in this country for 14 years

1191
01:28:24,890 --> 01:28:28,220
a little longer then that in Brazil and Japan.
But still relatively...

1192
01:28:28,230 --> 01:28:30,290
after all that is..
- It is in a vault.

1193
01:28:30,691 --> 01:28:32,891
The old meets the new.

1194
01:28:32,991 --> 01:28:35,291
I'm excited about the under card.

1195
01:28:35,292 --> 01:28:37,992
So, these competitors who we don't know yet.

1196
01:28:38,010 --> 01:28:40,800
Tomy, Tommy.
Check this out.

1197
01:28:41,510 --> 01:28:43,610
We got to see this.

1198
01:28:50,711 --> 01:28:52,811
It's the craziest thing I ever seen.

1199
01:29:00,700 --> 01:29:03,890
It's Terry.
- That's Mike!

1200
01:29:05,991 --> 01:29:08,391
It's here.
- Down there.

1201
01:29:09,892 --> 01:29:12,792
Come on, Mike.
- Win it.

1202
01:29:12,793 --> 01:29:14,293
Hang on it, Mike.

1203
01:29:16,694 --> 01:29:18,194
Skills, Mike.

1204
