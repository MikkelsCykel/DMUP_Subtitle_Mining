1
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:54,900
Hey, hey, you're digging
the master jock for solid rock...

2
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,400
...Sweet Al Monte blasting, babies.

3
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:00,800
Being bold and pouring coal on KRML
in quaint little Carmel-by-the-Sea.

4
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:04,700
We're next door to magnificent Monterey,
home of the annual jazz festival.

5
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,800
Although it's four months away,
you got to get your tickets...

6
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:10,100
...because they're going fast
and it can't last.

7
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:13,400
The time is 7:54
and there's a breeze of 50 degrees...

8
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:16,400
...around your loving hips,
and there's a taste of fog.

9
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,900
I say we got a bowl of soul,
and if you think your heart can take it...

10
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,200
...come fly higher with The Heavy!

11
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:26,000
Now we're gonna wrap it up
for the week, folks.

12
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:30,300
A brand-new release from the funk capital
of the world, Squeeze Me.

13
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:33,400
Here he comes, the big "D" himself,
Dave Garver.

14
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,500
And Dave is gonna bring you
five hours of mellow groove.

15
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,900
In the meantime,
this is Sweet Al Monte saying:

16
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,300
"Hang in there, babies, because everything
is going to be everything."

17
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,500
'Bye.

18
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:48,000
What's that letter you got there?
Is that that Frisco gig?

19
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,200
Yeah.

20
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,500
All right, so what's happening?

21
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,500
They want the usual thing:
A biography, pictures.

22
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,300
Really? Is that that Madge Brenner chick?

23
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,100
Yeah, she's the one putting it together.

24
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,500
In that case, David, you're in.

25
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,700
How do you figure that?

26
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,100
Now, David, come on, man.
Are you kidding?

27
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,900
She's a grandmother.

28
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,500
So when did that ever stop you?

29
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:29,200
You better get a move on.
I already played your theme.

30
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,800
Yeah, I heard it.
You're a real human being.

31
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:34,000
And you're on the air, baby.

32
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,100
All right.

33
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,100
"Men have destroyed the roads of wonder

34
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,300
"And their cities squat like black toads

35
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:54,600
"In the orchards of life
nothing is clean or real

36
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:58,100
"Or as a girl, naked to love
or be a man with"

37
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,300
This is Dave Garver with a little verse,
a little talk...

38
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:05,200
...and five hours of music
to be very, very nice to each other by.

39
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,500
- KRML, Dave Garver speaking.
- Hello?

40
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:19,000
- Hi, what'll it be?
- Play Misty for me.

41
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:20,100
Misty?

42
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:23,100
We have that right on the play rack.

43
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,900
Thanks for calling.

44
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:29,700
I see you got your little Misty chick
calling you again. All righty.

45
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,400
- Swing along.
- You take it easy now.

46
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,700
See you in the a.m.

47
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,800
KRML, Dave Garver.

48
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:12,900
- Hi, Murphy.
- Hi, Dave. No messages for you.

49
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,200
- No?
- Heard your show tonight.

50
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,800
It sure beats hell out
of working for a living.

51
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,500
- Thanks for the plug.
- What are friends for?

52
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,400
- Bartender.
- Coke? Coming right up.

53
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,500
She's waiting for someone.

54
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,000
You sure?

55
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:37,400
That's what she says.
Guys have been striking out all night.

56
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,500
One game?

57
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,400
- Cry Bastion?
- What else?

58
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:50,900
Okay, coach. You asked for it.

59
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,000
Don't take all night. Move.

60
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,400
Okay.

61
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:06,300
Move.

62
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,500
Palfrey's Gambit.

63
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,600
Dirty rat.
Are we playing Copenhagen rules?

64
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,900
Make it easy on yourself, Murph.

65
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,100
Cry Bastion.

66
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,700
Sorry, no Bastion.

67
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,700
Damn, I didn't see that.

68
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,600
It's too bad, Murphy. Too bad.

69
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:43,300
- Careful now.
- That ought to do it.

70
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,200
Be really careful now.

71
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,300
Careful.

72
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,300
Hi.

73
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,400
He doesn't see it.

74
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,500
Yeah?

75
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,200
Cry Bastion.

76
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:06,200
Fool's ploy, my man. Fool's ploy.

77
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,500
Care to play the winner?

78
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,300
I'll just watch.

79
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:15,400
- My name is Dave Garver.
- Evelyn Draper.

80
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:17,800
Sit down, Evelyn Draper?

81
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,600
Care for a drink?

82
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,100
Okay.

83
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,100
- What'll it be?
- Surprise me.

84
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,100
- Screwdriver.
- Nice game.

85
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,100
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

86
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,700
- What happened?
- I won.

87
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:33,100
How? When?

88
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,700
When you said, "Okay."

89
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,700
I ought to be mad.

90
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,500
But you're not.

91
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,800
Not really.

92
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:55,700
It certainly was nice of you
to bring me home, Mr. Garver?

93
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,100
That's right.

94
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,900
I don't think I've been stood up on a date
since the ninth grade back in Albany.

95
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,500
Is something wrong?

96
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:09,400
No, I keep getting the feeling
I know you from someplace.

97
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,700
- You do?
- Yeah.

98
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:15,000
Here. Why don't you let me do that?

99
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:17,200
Oh, no. That's all right. I've got it.

100
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:19,700
Why don't you see
if you can get the fire started?

101
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,400
All right.

102
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:29,700
There are some matches right next to it.

103
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,100
All right.

104
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:41,300
It's getting late.
You're sure I'm not keeping you up?

105
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,300
No. I rarely get to bed before 3:00 a.m.

106
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,100
I didn't have a date tonight.

107
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:54,400
I went there because you talk about it
on your program sometimes...

108
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,500
...and I wanted to meet you.

109
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,400
I listen to you all the time.

110
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,900
I knew somebody was out there.

111
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,400
- You're making fun of me.
- No, I'm not.

112
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:14,300
- Say something else.
- Such as?

113
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,300
Play Misty for me?

114
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,000
Very good.

115
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:25,700
- You sure I'm not keeping you up?
- Don't you like me?

116
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,300
You're a very nice girl.

117
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,700
But who needs nice girls?

118
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,800
No, I like them.

119
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,900
I'm kind of hung up on one.

120
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,900
And you don't want to complicate your life.

121
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,800
- That's exactly right.
- Neither do I.

122
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:46,700
But that's no reason we shouldn't
sleep together tonight if we feel like it.

123
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,800
Solid silicone.

124
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:03,300
Hi, David, my man! How you been, baby?

125
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:06,300
See you got the joint cleaned up for once.
The Heavy digs it.

126
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,300
- Care for a beer?
- Not really.

127
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:12,100
I could go for something more uplifting,
but not a brew, my man.

128
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:15,300
Beer is all we've got.
You're gonna have to ease on out.

129
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,900
I got a lot of work to do today.

130
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,300
You don't understand.
I've been sent here to get you.

131
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,500
By whom?

132
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,500
That old chick I go with. What's her name?

133
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,200
- Carol?
- That's the one.

134
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:28,800
Girl thinks you've been working too hard.
She said we should get together tonight.

135
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,100
Who's this "we"?

136
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,900
Me, you, her and one of them hens
that you can dig up.

137
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:37,700
There is a fantastic new Mexican place
in Carmel called Susinos.

138
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,500
The albóndigas soup is unbelievable.
It is a mind-bender...

139
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:44,100
I know the joint, but I don't have a date,
and I got a lot to do.

140
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,300
Big deal, man. Get one!

141
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,900
If you have any problems getting one,
I'll get one for you as nice as I look.

142
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,800
It's too late, and besides,
I've got a lot of work to do.

143
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,300
But you gotta eat, David.

144
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:58,000
I'm gonna whip up something
here in my own kitchen.

145
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:01,200
You know, David,
I'm really worried about your social life.

146
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,500
You'll make someone
a tremendous mother.

147
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,000
Too narrow in the pelvis.

148
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:10,000
I sure appreciate you dropping by, Al.
Come by again sometime, anytime.

149
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,800
Never let it be said
that Sweet Al Monte can't take a hint.

150
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:13,600
- Who's hinting?
- Hi.

151
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,700
Why, hi there, yourself.

152
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,000
Dave Garver live here?

153
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:21,000
That depends on your point of view.

154
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:22,700
Hi.

155
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
This stuff weighs a ton.
Where's the kitchen?

156
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,400
Right inside.
Just come on in and help yourself.

157
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,500
Swing right around the bend there.

158
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,300
I know, David, she's from Chicken Delight.

159
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,600
Look, don't work too hard, my man.

160
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,300
Don't strain yourself.

161
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,700
How come you don't have any beer?

162
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,900
And what is this? A shrunken head?

163
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,200
Does that guy live here?

164
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,100
- I wanted...
- I hope you like steak.

165
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,900
- You look like a steak-and-potatoes type.
- Hang on.

166
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,900
I said to myself,
a nice salad with Roquefort and tomatoes...

167
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,900
...and baked potato with...
- What's going on here?

168
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:01,900
- Don't send me away.
- No, I want to ask you a question.

169
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,400
I just wanted to surprise you.

170
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,900
Surprise?

171
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,800
What happens if he and I
had been talking business?

172
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:13,200
Or maybe I have female company
and you come traipsing in with groceries?

173
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:15,500
That would be some surprise.

174
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,300
I'm sorry.

175
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,300
Keep that stuff.
I think I've lost my appetite.

176
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,600
Hang on a minute.

177
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,500
I'm just trying to tell you something.

178
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,700
I don't understand.
Should I go or stay? What?

179
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:29,100
I'm telling you there's a telephone,
and I pick it up and I dial it.

180
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:32,000
You answer and I say,
"What are you doing?"

181
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,600
And I say, "I'll be right over."

182
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,900
Fine. Next time,
why don't we do it that way?

183
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,500
Okay. Any way you like. Next time.

184
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,200
How do you like your steak?

185
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,500
Extremely rare.

186
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,800
That's just how I like mine.
Extremely rare.

187
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,600
I'll get some wine here. A little vino.

188
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,900
Vino! All this and heaven, too!

189
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,400
Terrific!

190
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,100
This is gonna be some dinner.

191
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,900
What happened to that discussion
we had last time?

192
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,100
You know,
the deal about no strings and all that?

193
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,000
There are no strings,
but I never said anything...

194
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:15,000
...about not coming back for seconds, did I?

195
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:18,100
That's right. You didn't.

196
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:27,900
When will I see you?

197
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,900
I'll give you a call.

198
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,300
- Dave, you're funny.
- How's that?

199
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,900
If you want to keep playing these games,
okay, but...

200
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,400
...they're really not necessary anymore,
not for me.

201
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,300
People are trying to sleep here!

202
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,500
People are trying to talk here!

203
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,200
- How'd you like to tell that to the law?
- How'd you like to go screw yourself?

204
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,700
Take it easy!
Guy's just trying to sleep, that's all.

205
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,200
You're right.

206
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:01,300
It's a terrific morning.
Why be selfish with it?

207
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,100
Bye-bye.

208
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,700
Wait a minute!

209
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,600
Yeah?

210
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:33,500
Excuse me, I saw the sweater,
and I thought you were somebody else.

211
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,500
You must be David.

212
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,600
Where have you been?

213
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,900
Around.

214
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:02,600
I was trying to join the revolt
against the representational.

215
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,300
Didn't quite make that though.

216
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,900
So now I'm just trying to play it cool.

217
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,900
Not quite making that either.

218
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,600
Got time for a break?

219
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,900
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

220
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,300
- When did you get in town?
- Yesterday.

221
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:27,500
- You weren't gonna call me?
- Of course I was. I had to get settled first.

222
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,600
You shouldn't lend your sweaters
to blabbermouths.

223
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,800
You've gotten thinner.

224
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,100
No!

225
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,500
Well, so much for Sausalito.

226
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,400
Sausalito?

227
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:42,200
That's where I was staying.
Jay Jay's place.

228
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:45,000
- Jay Jay's place?
- It's nothing much, really.

229
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:48,000
It's just a little pied-à-terre,
but it's handy to the fleet.

230
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,100
You told me
you didn't know where she was.

231
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,200
So I lied. Picket me.

232
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:55,900
- Thanks a lot.
- Listen, stud, it wasn't my idea.

233
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,700
You should have caught her act.

234
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,600
The whole Bette Davis,
through-finished-kaput scene.

235
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:05,300
- And at 3:00 a.m.
- Come on, Jay Jay. He's exaggerating.

236
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,900
I'll check with Malcolm.
Maybe I can get you the afternoon off.

237
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,700
What happened, pussycat?

238
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:16,100
He ran into Anjelica.
She told him I was back.

239
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:19,800
That bitch should be hung by the thumbs
or something equally appropriate.

240
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,500
It's all set up.

241
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,100
Let's go.

242
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,300
It's nothing personal, really.

243
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,900
I happen to think
she could be a first-rate artist...

244
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,500
...if her damned hormones
didn't get in the way.

245
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:33,600
- There's not much he can do about that.
- He could kill himself.

246
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,000
Jay Jay,
why don't you go cruise some sailors?

247
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,800
Please, don't mention seafood.

248
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,200
Come on.

249
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,900
I really missed this place.

250
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:56,700
I missed you.

251
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:00,600
You'd do me a big favor
if you didn't say things like that.

252
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:02,400
Why is that?

253
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,800
I don't know.
Somehow it brings out the worst in me.

254
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:09,700
It makes me want to say things like,
"How's that redhead?"

255
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,100
What?

256
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,800
The redhead,
the one who worked in the bookstore.

257
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,500
She went back to Berkeley or whatever.

258
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,400
That's too bad.

259
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:22,800
You always have that blonde
from Santa Barbara to fall back on.

260
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,500
If that's the phrase I'm looking for,
and I think it probably is.

261
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,700
What are we gonna do?
Go through a whole list? Is that it?

262
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:32,300
Who's got that kind of time?

263
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,300
I just don't know if I'm up to it anymore.

264
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,700
Up to what?

265
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:42,200
Those nights sitting and waiting for you
to finish your program and come by.

266
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:44,900
Nights when it would start to get late...

267
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,700
...and I'd start to think:

268
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:51,500
"I wonder if he's run himself off a cliff
or maybe he's run into a blonde."

269
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:56,100
There was a time
when I started rooting for the accident.

270
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,700
I mean, if it was a choice
between that and a blonde.

271
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,700
You don't know
how secure you make me feel.

272
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,700
I didn't wish you anything too serious.

273
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:06,300
Just a couple of months in traction.

274
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,700
You're all heart.

275
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,000
You know, the thing I hate the most
in the whole world is a jealous female...

276
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,800
...and that's what I was becoming.

277
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,700
That's why I had to split.

278
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:23,000
I was starting to be
one of my most unfavorite people.

279
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,100
I hated it. I know you did, too.

280
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:33,300
That still works anyway.

281
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:36,400
- Too well sometimes.
- What does that mean?

282
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:40,900
I mean, there's a little spot in the middle
of each day, just about your size.

283
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,500
There's lots of girls my size
if you're really looking.

284
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,500
I'm not. That's what I'm trying to tell you.

285
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:53,700
You mean you've given up girls?

286
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:58,100
I haven't exactly been the monk
of the month or anything like that...

287
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,400
...but I have been making an effort.

288
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,900
There must be a real consternation
among those "gropies."

289
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,700
That's "groupies," isn't it?

290
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:08,900
I don't know, "groupies, gropies..."

291
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:12,900
You know, you've got to be fair.
It hasn't just been my fault.

292
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Listen, I know.
They kept overpowering you.

293
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,700
You get a little bit of the blame, too,
you know.

294
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:23,500
You and that parade of roommates
that keep moving in and out of your place.

295
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,300
I didn't realize
they were such a trial to you.

296
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,100
What trial? I enjoyed it.

297
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,700
You and I sitting in front of the fireplace...

298
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,700
...and then some chick sitting there
with a bathrobe on, eating Fig Newtons.

299
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,300
What about the one with the St. Bernard?

300
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,900
She was a real winner.
She took up enough space.

301
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,600
And then that other one
that took the flute lessons.

302
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:48,100
Yeah, maybe it was a little rough on you.

303
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,900
I can think of a thousand reasons
why we should try again.

304
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:08,800
I've got about seven billion things to do.

305
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:09,900
What do you think?

306
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
You want to try for a new start,
right from the letter "A"?

307
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:20,400
- What am I gonna do with you?
- A lot.

308
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:27,100
Hi. Excuse me.

309
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,300
Hi.

310
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,700
- You've met Anjelica, my...
- Roommate. Yes.

311
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:37,300
I think I'll drive into Carmel and see
if I can't find some cleaning solvent.

312
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,300
There's plenty under the sink.

313
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:41,000
Okay.

314
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:44,100
This house ought to have a revolving door.

315
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:47,500
You know when my father left me
this house, he left me payments.

316
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:51,900
I can't handle that expense by myself
and most girls don't like the isolation.

317
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,300
- It's a long way from town.
- I know.

318
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,100
I better get back to work.

319
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:03,300
- Thanks.
- That's it, "thanks"?

320
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,600
Four months in Sausalito is a long time.

321
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:14,100
I am not gonna get back
on that same old merry-go-round again.

322
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:17,000
What do I have to do,
give you a notarized statement?

323
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:21,700
I need a couple of more days to try and...

324
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,000
...figure out where I'm at.

325
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:29,500
Okay. You get your bearings,
and then you'll give me a call, all right?

326
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,800
- Hi, Murph.
- Hi, Dave.

327
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:47,200
Sardine Factory.

328
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,000
Dave Garver?

329
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,100
You said this is Evelyn?

330
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:54,800
No.

331
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:57,100
Sorry, you've just missed him.

332
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,800
- What do you mean?
- He's gone. He's not here.

333
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,900
I think you'd better look again.

334
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,000
Believe me, you just missed him.

335
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,900
Now if you're interested
in someone more sophisticated...

336
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,400
...l'll be happy to...

337
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,500
That's what I get for being a dirty old man.

338
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:18,100
There's a message for you,
a Madge somebody from San Francisco.

339
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:21,000
- Brenner?
- That's it. Al Monte gave her this number.

340
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,600
"Received pictures and biography.

341
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:27,000
"Please send a two-hour tape
of your show as soon as possible."

342
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,700
- Thanks, Murph.
- Don't mention it.

343
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:31,800
I can't tell you how thrilled I am
to be your social secretary.

344
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:35,900
You will put that on my tab?

345
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:56,700
Surprise!

346
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
What are you doing here?

347
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:07,500
I was calling you from that phone booth
and he told me you'd left...

348
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:11,000
...and I was staring right at your car.
Isn't that funny?

349
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:13,000
Yeah, kind of funny.

350
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:15,500
Why didn't you take my call?

351
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:19,700
Where does it say I gotta drop everything
and answer the phone every time it rings?

352
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:24,100
Do you know your nostrils flare out
into little wings when you're mad?

353
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,800
- It's kind of cute.
- Come on, Evelyn. I gotta go.

354
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:29,500
- I'd love a Coke.
- Not now, I gotta get to the station.

355
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:30,700
No, you don't.

356
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
You're talking to your No. 1 fan.
You don't work tonight.

357
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:39,900
I've got this show that I'm trying to set
and it's very important to me.

358
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,000
That means I gotta pick the music,
write the lead-ins and find some poetry.

359
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:45,800
- Come on, will you?
- Poetry?

360
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:48,900
- Let me help you. I'm terrific with poetry...
- Not tonight!

361
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,400
Does he want his keys?

362
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,500
- Come on, Evelyn.
- Speak.

363
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,400
- Come on!
- God!

364
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:06,800
Good boy! Let's hear it. Come on.

365
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,100
Come on. Give me my keys.

366
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:12,500
- Come on. Give me the keys.
- Come on.

367
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:16,600
Give me the keys, goddamn it!

368
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:20,000
- Having some trouble, lady?
- Get lost!

369
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,700
Yeah, get lost, assholes!

370
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,500
Let's split.
He's got enough trouble already.

371
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,300
Yeah. Excuse me.

372
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,900
'Bye. See you later.

373
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,600
Hi.

374
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,300
Get all your work done?

375
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,700
What do you want, Evelyn?

376
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:31,900
One Coke?

377
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:34,900
I'll tell you, tonight I'm really whipped.

378
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,500
What time is it?

379
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,600
Time for me to go home.

380
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:33,500
Go back to sleep.

381
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,700
- Hey, I've got an idea.
- What's that?

382
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:41,200
Some night this week, after the show...

383
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:44,200
...corned beef and potato salad,
dill pickles, the whole bit.

384
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:46,000
My place. Deal?

385
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:48,000
I'll call you.

386
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,700
Thursday's good for me.

387
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:08,700
And now from KRML,
the big-band sounds of Dee Barton.

388
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,800
Here's a fresh reel of tape
for your air check.

389
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:13,800
- You want me to thread it up?
- No, leave it here. Thanks.

390
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:17,800
I think I will go out and hit the streets,
but before doing that...

391
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:20,600
...I will blow me a little number.
Care to partake?

392
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:24,400
Take it in the other room.
I get zonked just breathing the air here.

393
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,000
All right, be that way.

394
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,600
- AI?
- Yeah?

395
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,400
Do you ever find yourself...

396
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:39,700
...being completely smothered
by somebody?

397
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:43,400
- Anybody I know?
- You met her at my house the other day.

398
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:45,800
Chicken Delight!

399
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:48,000
That's what I call
a pretty good smothering.

400
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:52,300
You start a relationship thinking
you're gonna be completely honest and...

401
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,700
...suddenly the whole thing
gets out of hand.

402
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,800
What's the problem?

403
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:59,800
The problem is I've been trying
to uncomplicate my life...

404
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:01,900
...and now I can't even answer the door.

405
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,700
Besides, Tobie's back.

406
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:06,700
Oh, really? Tobie? When?

407
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,400
- I ran into her Sunday.
- That was a goody.

408
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:12,100
I'll tell you the truth.

409
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:15,800
I've always thought Tobie was
one of the foxiest chicks on the peninsula.

410
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:19,900
And why you gotta have so much action,
I just don't understand it anyway.

411
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,700
It's just a hang-up I have, or had.

412
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,300
But now that I seem to have that
straightened out...

413
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:28,200
...I can't seem to solve this other problem.

414
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:32,500
Well, you know what they always say,
my man.

415
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,000
No, what?

416
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:39,900
"He who lives by the sword
shall die by the sword."

417
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:43,700
Don't let the door hit you in the ass
on the way out.

418
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:47,100
Later.

419
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:53,600
We'll have more smooth sounds
in just one minute...

420
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:57,600
...but first, at ten minutes to the hour,
we're broadcasting from KRML...

421
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:59,800
...in the Carmel Rancho Shopping Center...

422
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:03,200
...home of the buccaneer,
the man's boutique.

423
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,800
KRML, Dave Garver speaking.

424
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,500
The whole point
in having an answering service...

425
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:15,100
...is to call in once in a while
to check for messages.

426
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,300
Hi, Evelyn. What's happening?

427
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:20,500
What could be happening, darling?
You're not here yet.

428
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:21,900
"Yet"?

429
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,000
I hope you like pastrami,
because there was no corned beef.

430
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:27,000
Now, wait a minute. Just hold on.

431
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:31,000
Are you trying to tell me
you forgot that we have a date tonight?

432
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:33,700
I thought I was supposed
to call you on that.

433
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:37,300
I feel kind of silly sitting here
in my brand-new lounging pajamas.

434
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:40,100
I just assumed...

435
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,100
Apparently, I assumed wrong.

436
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:46,500
That's right. You assumed wrong.

437
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,500
You don't have to come over
if you've got something better to do.

438
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:56,100
I'll be over in a little while.
You and I are gonna have to have a talk.

439
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:58,500
Whatever you say.

440
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:01,100
In the meantime,
haven't you forgotten something else?

441
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:02,800
What's that?

442
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,600
Weren't you gonna play Misty for me?

443
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,100
Yeah. I have that one right here.

444
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,200
Thank you, darling.

445
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:33,600
And now we have a pretty one
for lonely lovers on a cool, cool night.

446
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,600
It's the great Erroll Garner classic, Misty.

447
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,400
And this one is especially for Evelyn.

448
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:42,500
Just a second.

449
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:02,900
Come in.

450
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,300
Hi.

451
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,100
Hi.

452
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,600
- Cold night?
- Yeah.

453
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,700
But you got here anyway. Stout fella.

454
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,900
There's something
we're gonna have to get straight.

455
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:24,300
It's amazing what a man will go through
for a hot pastrami sandwich.

456
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:25,700
- Look...
- Wait a minute.

457
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,900
You haven't told me how nice I look.

458
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,900
- You look fine.
- The sales lady guaranteed you'd flip.

459
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,500
- Now, listen. Can we talk?
- Wait.

460
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,000
First...

461
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:47,700
Surprise.

462
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,100
- Don't you like them?
- Yeah, they're great, but...

463
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:54,900
Don't spoil my fun, darling.
I love to give you things.

464
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,800
It's Madame Butterfly time.

465
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:01,800
First, friendly neighborhood geisha
remove honorable shoes.

466
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:03,300
Stop it, Evelyn!

467
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,300
Now, we've gotta talk!

468
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,700
Have I done something wrong?

469
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,900
I'm just trying to be straight with you,
that's all.

470
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:14,000
Be nice to me instead.

471
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,100
Jesus Christ!

472
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,000
I don't understand.

473
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:24,300
Are you trying to say
you don't love me anymore?

474
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,500
I never told you that I loved you.

475
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,100
Not in words maybe, but...

476
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:33,900
...there are ways of saying things
that have nothing to do with words.

477
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
I'm sorry you read it that way.

478
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:40,900
It's that other bitch, isn't it?

479
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:42,900
What are you talking about?

480
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,100
The silver-framed picture in your dresser.

481
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:49,300
- That picture's got nothing to do with you.
- What does have to do with me?

482
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:52,500
- I never lied to you.
- Big deal. He never lied to me.

483
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:55,400
What do you want for that?
The Congressional Medal of Honor?

484
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:58,600
- So long.
- What am I supposed to do?

485
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:00,900
Sit here all dressed up
in my little whore suit...

486
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,900
...waiting for my lord and master to call?

487
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,400
- Nobody asked you to wait for anything.
- You're not dumping me!

488
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:08,900
- Get off my back, Evelyn!
- Get off your back?

489
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,300
That's where you've been keeping me,
isn't it?

490
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:15,100
You're nothing!
You're not even good in bed!

491
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,500
I just felt sorry for you, that's all!

492
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:21,500
Bastard! You poor, pathetic bastard!

493
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,600
Hello?

494
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:50,000
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean those things I said.

495
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:52,200
Will I see you tomorrow?

496
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,200
You don't listen, do you?

497
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:57,500
Let me come over.
If I could just see you, just talk to you.

498
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:01,400
- No, Evelyn.
- But I love you, David. I love you.

499
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:20,000
David! If I could just...

500
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,900
What's the matter?

501
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,700
Nothing. Why?

502
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:49,900
No, come on.

503
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
You haven't heard a word I've been saying.

504
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:55,100
- I have. I've heard everything you said.
- You did?

505
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,700
All right, tell me.

506
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:00,100
- You don't believe me?
- Go ahead.

507
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:03,200
Okay, wise chick.

508
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:07,200
We're supposed to go to a party
at Big Sur tomorrow night.

509
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:10,100
I'm supposed to meet you there at 9:00.

510
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:14,400
And the address is...

511
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,100
I didn't tell you that.

512
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,100
See how you are?

513
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,900
I don't know myself yet.
I'll call you tomorrow about it.

514
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,100
Okay.

515
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,100
You call me tomorrow.

516
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,100
Honey, we better go.

517
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:33,800
- We're just getting to the best part.
- But I've got to pick Anjelica up at 6:00.

518
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:37,300
God! How the pain is setting in.

519
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,700
Come on. She's a very nice girl.

520
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:42,200
Anyway, she's moving out tonight.

521
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:46,300
Now, that's about the best news
I've heard in years.

522
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,400
And Madalyn's moving in.

523
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:49,800
Madalyn?

524
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:09,900
Shit.

525
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:38,400
- What's going on?
- Don't tell me he was asleep!

526
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:40,300
What else at this hour of the morning?

527
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,500
I'm surprised his conscience
was that clear!

528
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:45,800
- What do you want, Evelyn?
- "What do you want, Evelyn?"

529
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:47,300
Do I have to want something?

530
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,700
Can't I just come over?
Or is it inconvenient?

531
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:51,300
- Wait a...
- Did I make a boo-boo?

532
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,700
Has someone been sleeping
in Papa Bear's bed?

533
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:55,300
Wait a minute, goddamn it!

534
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:57,500
"Come out, come out, wherever you are!"

535
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:02,500
I thought...

536
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:10,100
God, don't look at me that way, Dave.

537
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:12,100
I just don't know what to say to you.

538
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:15,200
I'm sorry I mistrusted you.
I know you'd never spoil it.

539
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:16,900
To spoil what?

540
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:19,800
What we have between us.

541
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:23,200
We don't have a goddamn thing!
How many ways do I have to say this?

542
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:26,300
I don't care how many ways you say it,
it's not true!

543
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:30,000
- What do I have to do to convince you?
- It's not true!

544
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:31,600
It's not!

545
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:33,700
What are you doing?

546
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:36,500
I'm gonna get dressed and drive you home,
that's what.

547
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:40,500
Why are you playing these games?
Why are you pretending you don't love me?

548
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,900
I don't even believe I'm hearing this.

549
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:45,800
But I love you!

550
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,200
You haven't got the vaguest idea
what love is.

551
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:50,700
We don't even know each other.

552
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:53,800
Wait a minute.

553
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,400
You don't have to do that.
I'm okay. I can drive home.

554
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:01,300
Are you sure?

555
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:04,000
Positive. I'm fine.

556
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:07,100
Let me just wash my face.

557
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:13,900
You ready?

558
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:26,900
You okay?

559
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:50,700
Oh, no.

560
00:45:57,700 --> 00:45:59,400
How's she gonna be?

561
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,100
I sutured the wounds.
It wasn't quite as bad as it looked.

562
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:05,100
It couldn't have been.

563
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:10,400
You know, Dave,
I'm supposed to turn a report in on this.

564
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,900
But you won't. You see, Tobie's back.

565
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:17,500
I'd rather tell her, and not have her read it
in the paper somewhere.

566
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:21,400
I didn't know that. I'll tell Marie.
We'll do the spaghetti number.

567
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:25,700
- Somebody gonna be around here today?
- Me. I'll be here.

568
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:28,400
I bombed her out pretty good.

569
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:30,900
Let her sleep it off
before you take her home.

570
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,100
- And how long will that be?
- It's hard to say. Why?

571
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:38,100
- I'd like to take Tobie out tonight.
- No problem.

572
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:41,500
She'll wake up sometime this afternoon,
5:00 or so.

573
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
Is she gonna be all right?

574
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:49,100
The cuts were really pretty superficial.

575
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:51,900
I mean, do you think she'll try it again?

576
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:55,200
Chances are against it.

577
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:57,100
But I'd watch her.

578
00:46:57,300 --> 00:47:01,700
I wouldn't leave her alone if she seems
unusually depressed or insecure.

579
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,300
Better get some sleep yourself.
You look like hell.

580
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:07,900
Call me if you need me.

581
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,800
Thanks, Frank. I really appreciate it.

582
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:31,100
How are you feeling?

583
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:33,400
Okay. Fine.

584
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:35,500
Here.

585
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:40,200
Thank you.

586
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:42,400
Brought you a little soup.

587
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:45,900
It looks good.

588
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:52,500
I don't know what to say.

589
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:55,000
It frightens me thinking about it.

590
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:57,100
Don't think about it.

591
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:59,900
I don't mean me. I mean you.

592
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:06,500
"Girl commits suicide
in disc jockey's home."

593
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:10,700
It's not very good publicity
for a man in your position.

594
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:16,100
Get some rest. As soon as you feel better,
I'll take you home.

595
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:17,800
Thank you, David.

596
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:24,500
I got your clothes hung up
in the closet there.

597
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:27,300
Maybe you better answer the phone.

598
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:30,600
Yeah. I'll get it in the other room.

599
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:41,500
Hello.

600
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:45,000
Hi. I just wanted to check.
We still on for tonight?

601
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:48,100
Yeah, I'm ready to go.
What time is the party?

602
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:52,900
Madalyn's already left,
and she won't be back for a long time...

603
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:55,200
...and I was just thinking...

604
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:59,900
Would you be disappointed if we didn't go
to the party and just stayed here instead?

605
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:04,100
I think I can bear up under it.

606
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:06,900
Don't be too long.

607
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:09,700
- That's me at the door.
- David...

608
00:49:11,100 --> 00:49:14,800
...the way I look at it,
the hell with Sausalito.

609
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:17,800
Bye-bye.

610
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:51,100
Evelyn?

611
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,500
- What's the matter? Take it easy.
- I had a dream.

612
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:58,700
I was drowning in the ocean and
I called to you, but you just stood there...

613
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:00,800
...watching. Watching.

614
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:04,300
It was just a dream.

615
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:06,500
Oh, God, I'm so alone.

616
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,800
Hold me.

617
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:11,900
Hold me, Dave. Please.

618
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:14,000
Yeah.

619
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,300
Tighter.

620
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:19,300
Tighter.

621
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:22,500
Don't let me go.

622
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:25,100
Don't let me go.

623
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:42,500
David!

624
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:48,700
I woke up and you were gone.

625
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:59,700
If you have something planned for tonight,
you could just take me home.

626
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:02,000
Maybe that'd be best.

627
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:06,900
No, no, there's nothing.

628
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,000
Good.

629
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:16,300
Isn't this nice?

630
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:18,500
Just us here, together.

631
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:37,200
Here we go again.

632
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:43,000
Stone-cold dead in the market.

633
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:47,100
Must have been quite a party.

634
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:50,900
Go away, Birdie.

635
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:54,200
Any other bodies,
any other juiceheads around here?

636
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:59,400
Come back tomorrow, will you?
Or next year sometime.

637
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:01,800
I better check the workbench.

638
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:09,900
All right, break it up in here.

639
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:13,000
Looks like old times around this place.

640
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:14,700
Evelyn?

641
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:22,100
Lose something, tiger?

642
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:26,900
You couldn't find it within your heart
to come back at a later time, could you?

643
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,900
This is a later time, pussycat.

644
00:53:29,100 --> 00:53:31,700
I'm paying you back
for the day I blew last week.

645
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:33,000
Evelyn?

646
00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:39,400
Very funny, Birdie. Very funny.

647
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:43,800
What I can't figure out is,
with all this action going on in here...

648
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:46,400
...what are you doing
out there couching it?

649
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:48,600
What is this, some kind of Kinsey Report?

650
00:53:48,700 --> 00:53:51,500
Do I come over to your house
and ask a lot of dumb questions?

651
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:52,900
You just ought to, pussycat.

652
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,500
Might open up
a whole new way of life to you.

653
00:53:57,600 --> 00:53:58,600
Hold it.

654
00:53:58,700 --> 00:54:00,900
Let's try to show a little class, shall we?

655
00:54:04,300 --> 00:54:06,100
Mr. Garver's residence.

656
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:09,600
I'll see.

657
00:54:10,300 --> 00:54:12,700
Do you want to talk to a Madge Brenner?

658
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:14,600
Yeah. I want to talk to her.

659
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:16,300
Thanks. Hello.

660
00:54:16,700 --> 00:54:19,400
Hello, Mr. Garver? Madge Brenner.

661
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:22,900
We like the tape on your show.
Like it very much.

662
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,900
There are one or two others in the running,
but, frankly...

663
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,300
Can we have lunch today?

664
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:29,900
- Windjammer still good?
- Yeah, still very good.

665
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,600
Reserve a table in your name.

666
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:34,600
- See you then, Mr. Garver.
- Great. Bye-bye.

667
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,100
Looks like we found Evelyn.

668
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:43,600
"Good morning, darling. Gone shopping.

669
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:46,100
"Back in a flash with the hash."

670
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:48,200
A little humor in there.

671
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:50,300
"Love and kisses, Evelyn."

672
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,500
And then it says:

673
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:55,600
"If you can't find your keys, don't worry.

674
00:54:57,500 --> 00:54:59,300
"I borrowed your car."

675
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:08,600
Here's your key, and here's your copy.

676
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:10,900
That'll be $0.40, please.

677
00:55:16,100 --> 00:55:17,600
Thank you. Have a nice day.

678
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:56,200
David? I stopped by my...

679
00:55:57,900 --> 00:55:59,000
Hi.

680
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:01,600
Don't you look all gussied up?

681
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:05,600
Good. I was gonna cook brunch
but this calls for something more festive.

682
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:08,200
How about the Marquis? My treat.

683
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:12,400
- After all I put you through, it's the least...
- I have a lunch date. Business.

684
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:14,900
- Business?
- Yeah. Can I have my car keys?

685
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,000
Sure.

686
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:18,800
I think you ought to take it easy, anyway.
Get some rest.

687
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:22,200
Yeah, I do feel a little tired.

688
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:36,500
Very funny, Dave.

689
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:40,000
Now, let's talk show.
Tell me, what do you think of the concept?

690
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:42,000
The unstructured...

691
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:46,800
...the loosey-goosey, Monterey pop,
Woodstock kind of thing?

692
00:56:47,100 --> 00:56:50,000
I like it very much,
and I think I can handle it.

693
00:56:50,300 --> 00:56:51,900
So do I.

694
00:56:52,100 --> 00:56:55,100
I'll keep this
to promote your new career with.

695
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:59,000
You'll be working with kids,
bright and marvelous.

696
00:56:59,100 --> 00:57:00,400
But they take handling.

697
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:02,700
If this goes the way I think it will...

698
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:06,300
...there's no reason in the world why...
- Isn't this cozy?

699
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:08,000
So this is your business lunch?

700
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:09,900
How's business?

701
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:11,900
Friend of yours?

702
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,600
- Just another trick.
- That's enough.

703
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,800
Is that your idea of a dish?

704
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,100
She's a little old for you, isn't she?

705
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:20,400
What is this,
"Be Kind to Senior Citizens Week"?

706
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:21,600
Get outta here!

707
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:25,400
I don't mind you being a bastard,
but do you have to be a tasteless one?

708
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:29,200
Stop it, you son of a bitch!
She couldn't get laid in a lumber camp!

709
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:32,700
Stop it, you son of a bitch!
You're hurting me!

710
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,200
Stop it, you dirty bastard! No!

711
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:37,400
Stop it! Dave!

712
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:39,900
No! No!

713
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:44,100
Don't leave me! Don't leave me!

714
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:47,400
She's nothing! Nothing! Nothing!

715
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:52,900
- I love you!
- Get her outta here.

716
00:57:53,100 --> 00:57:54,200
Where to?

717
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:57,400
I did it because I love you.
Don't you understand that?

718
00:57:57,500 --> 00:57:58,700
- I love you!
- Where to?

719
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:02,000
- Move!
- It's because I love you! Dave, please.

720
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:40,900
This is a private beach.

721
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:44,000
- I want to talk to you.
- I don't want to talk to you.

722
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:51,900
Are you drunk?

723
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:54,400
No, but that's not a bad idea.

724
00:58:55,300 --> 00:58:57,800
- Why, David?
- Why what? Drunk?

725
00:58:58,100 --> 00:59:00,400
No. Why last night?

726
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:04,200
That's what I came to explain to you.

727
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:05,900
Okay, good.

728
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:10,400
I think we should understand each other.
I'm not very happy with you.

729
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:11,800
That's fair enough.

730
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,900
Whatever it was, you could have called me.

731
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:15,500
No, I couldn't.

732
00:59:16,300 --> 00:59:17,200
Why not?

733
00:59:21,300 --> 00:59:23,800
I couldn't tell you the truth last night.

734
00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:26,000
I'm not gonna lie to you anymore.

735
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:31,700
Now, why do you have to say that?

736
00:59:40,300 --> 00:59:43,900
I just didn't want to take a chance
she'd try it again.

737
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,600
What if she does?

738
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:49,400
I swear to you, if she ever tries it...

739
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:52,200
...l'd just let her go right on ahead.

740
00:59:59,100 --> 01:00:00,100
God!

741
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:05,200
Oh, my God.

742
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:12,600
What in the...

743
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:19,800
Oh, God, help me!

744
01:01:19,900 --> 01:01:21,600
Please, somebody, help me!

745
01:01:27,300 --> 01:01:28,900
Help me, somebody!

746
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,800
Oh, God, help me!

747
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:55,100
- Stay back, buddy.
- I live here, man.

748
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:04,000
Is she your housecleaning lady, Garver?

749
01:02:06,100 --> 01:02:08,300
Okay, boys, let's take her out.

750
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:12,700
Watch your step.

751
01:02:14,900 --> 01:02:19,100
It's gonna cost you double
to clean up this mess.

752
01:02:19,900 --> 01:02:21,300
Watch your step.

753
01:02:21,500 --> 01:02:24,000
- Dave Garver?
- Yeah.

754
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:26,200
I'm Sgt. McCallum.

755
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:29,600
Any ideas?

756
01:02:31,100 --> 01:02:32,400
About what?

757
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:35,400
About your girlfriend in there.

758
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:39,100
That's not my girlfriend.

759
01:02:39,700 --> 01:02:42,400
Let me get that straight right in front.

760
01:02:56,500 --> 01:02:59,300
More or less a casual acquaintance,
you'd say?

761
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:01,100
That's right.

762
01:03:01,300 --> 01:03:05,200
You're saying she came by to hack up
your wardrobe and your cleaning lady?

763
01:03:07,900 --> 01:03:10,200
I'm not trying to tell you anything,
Sergeant.

764
01:03:10,300 --> 01:03:13,200
Maybe you ought to.
The lady almost got herself killed.

765
01:03:13,700 --> 01:03:17,200
And I'm stumbling around
in my stupid way trying to find out why.

766
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:20,500
What'll you have?

767
01:03:20,700 --> 01:03:23,100
This Evelyn Draper,
where does she come from?

768
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:24,200
I don't know.

769
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:27,300
- What about her family?
- I don't know that either.

770
01:03:29,700 --> 01:03:34,000
She just listens to my radio show,
and we met one night. That's all.

771
01:03:34,300 --> 01:03:36,700
- Practically a stranger.
- That's right.

772
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:40,300
Then how does she happen to have
a key to your front door?

773
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:42,300
I don't know that either.

774
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:45,400
It boils down to,
you don't know a hell of a lot, do you?

775
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:48,600
What it boils down to is,
I'm getting sick of your questions.

776
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,400
And so am I!

777
01:03:50,700 --> 01:03:54,600
But they get upset with me
down at the store if I don't ask them.

778
01:03:54,700 --> 01:03:57,100
- Just take her through. I'll be right along.
- Right.

779
01:03:57,800 --> 01:04:00,600
- Take her through what?
- Booking.

780
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:06,200
What she really needs is psychiatric help.

781
01:04:07,300 --> 01:04:08,500
Really?

782
01:04:11,100 --> 01:04:14,300
Now, look, those cuts on her wrists...

783
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:17,700
Don't know anything about those.

784
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:24,600
There's one other thing.

785
01:04:24,900 --> 01:04:26,900
I know, "Don't leave town."

786
01:04:27,300 --> 01:04:31,100
I was gonna say, "Why don't you play
some Mantovani sometime?"

787
01:04:32,800 --> 01:04:34,500
Didn't know you liked the show.

788
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:36,800
I don't. I like Mantovani.

789
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:09,900
Go ahead, play!

790
01:11:17,100 --> 01:11:18,100
All right!

791
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,500
Those of you who may have played
brass instruments...

792
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:29,300
...you know that was triple-tonguin', baby.

793
01:11:29,400 --> 01:11:31,800
Let's give his tongue a nice hand!

794
01:11:32,300 --> 01:11:35,400
He might just be
the fastest tongue in the West!

795
01:11:37,900 --> 01:11:40,100
- Come on.
- All right, I'm coming.

796
01:12:55,100 --> 01:12:56,800
What do you say...

797
01:12:57,300 --> 01:13:00,200
- Something to eat?
- I've got to pick up my roommate, Annabel.

798
01:13:00,300 --> 01:13:03,600
- Madalyn's your roommate.
- I found my man, and I'm moving out.

799
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,200
- And Annabel's moving in.
- Right.

800
01:13:07,300 --> 01:13:08,600
- 'Bye.
- Ciao.

801
01:13:09,900 --> 01:13:10,900
See you later.

802
01:13:43,100 --> 01:13:45,400
Thank you. Thank you very kindly.

803
01:14:49,400 --> 01:14:51,200
That was the Cannonball Adderley Group.

804
01:14:51,300 --> 01:14:53,900
They're playing
at the Monterey Jazz Festival with...

805
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:57,200
...Duke Ellington, Woody Herman,
Joe Williams and many others.

806
01:14:57,300 --> 01:14:58,800
Still got tickets for Sunday.

807
01:14:58,900 --> 01:15:02,300
So get on out there
because that's where it's happening.

808
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:06,900
Now we're gonna hear from the Gator
Creek Organization and Feelin' Fine.

809
01:15:11,900 --> 01:15:13,600
KRML. Dave Garver.

810
01:15:15,900 --> 01:15:17,300
Hello.

811
01:15:17,700 --> 01:15:19,400
Play Misty for me.

812
01:15:23,400 --> 01:15:24,500
David?

813
01:15:25,700 --> 01:15:28,200
I didn't mean to shake you up. I'm sorry.

814
01:15:28,500 --> 01:15:30,200
Pretty stupid of me.

815
01:15:30,900 --> 01:15:32,000
I've been released.

816
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:35,600
Therapy. It was a bad dream, but it's over.

817
01:15:36,100 --> 01:15:39,100
- Where are you?
- The airport. San Francisco.

818
01:15:39,500 --> 01:15:41,300
I've only got a minute between planes.

819
01:15:41,500 --> 01:15:44,100
- Got a job in Hawaii.
- You're all right then?

820
01:15:44,900 --> 01:15:46,600
Fine, David. Fine.

821
01:15:48,100 --> 01:15:50,900
I just want to say
how sorry I am about everything.

822
01:15:51,400 --> 01:15:53,700
- Forget it. I have.
- I hope so.

823
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:57,000
"Because this maiden
she lived with no other thought

824
01:15:57,100 --> 01:15:59,400
"Than to love and be loved by you."

825
01:16:02,100 --> 01:16:03,400
Are you near a radio?

826
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:05,200
No.

827
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:07,800
But play it for me anyway.

828
01:18:16,200 --> 01:18:17,200
Hello.

829
01:18:17,300 --> 01:18:18,500
- Garver?
- Yeah.

830
01:18:18,700 --> 01:18:21,400
Sgt. McCallum. Sorry to wake you
but something's come up.

831
01:18:21,500 --> 01:18:24,500
I know. She just paid me a visit
with a butcher knife.

832
01:18:24,900 --> 01:18:25,900
Why?

833
01:18:26,200 --> 01:18:29,500
Because she was released on parole
pending further legal action.

834
01:18:29,700 --> 01:18:30,900
When?

835
01:18:32,600 --> 01:18:33,600
A week ago.

836
01:18:34,300 --> 01:18:37,000
I sure like the way you broke your ass
to let me know!

837
01:18:37,200 --> 01:18:40,600
- I just found out about it myself.
- Who's in charge down there anyway?

838
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:43,800
Now, look. Do you want to help find her...

839
01:18:43,900 --> 01:18:47,100
...or would you rather just sit there
and bellyache?

840
01:18:47,500 --> 01:18:49,500
- All right.
- Good.

841
01:18:50,200 --> 01:18:52,800
Now exactly what did she say to you?

842
01:18:53,100 --> 01:18:57,200
I told you. She said that she was well
and that she was going to Hawaii.

843
01:18:57,400 --> 01:18:59,000
What else?

844
01:18:59,900 --> 01:19:01,800
- I already told you.
- Tell me again.

845
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:04,600
You know,
you really make lousy conversation.

846
01:19:04,900 --> 01:19:08,500
You make lousy coffee.
Come on, what else did she say?

847
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:10,400
Nothing, except...

848
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:14,300
- Except what?
- It was nothing. It was a line from a poem.

849
01:19:15,500 --> 01:19:18,500
- What poem?
- Lf I knew that, I'd know the line.

850
01:19:18,700 --> 01:19:21,700
- Try to remember.
- You know, McCallum, it's getting late.

851
01:19:22,300 --> 01:19:24,000
You're sounding very monotonous.

852
01:19:24,100 --> 01:19:26,900
You're not exactly my idea
of a swinging date either.

853
01:19:27,200 --> 01:19:29,000
Good night, McCallum.

854
01:19:32,300 --> 01:19:35,400
- What happened to the Mantovani?
- The what?

855
01:19:36,500 --> 01:19:40,400
I heard the show,
but I never did hear you play Mantovani.

856
01:19:40,500 --> 01:19:42,500
You really did listen to the show?

857
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:45,400
Friend, if we had a TV
down at the station...

858
01:19:45,500 --> 01:19:48,000
...l'd break my arm
before I turned your show on.

859
01:19:48,100 --> 01:19:49,600
Thanks a lot.

860
01:19:51,500 --> 01:19:55,100
Just hope we're lucky enough
to grab her the next time she tries it.

861
01:19:55,300 --> 01:19:56,700
Tries what?

862
01:19:57,100 --> 01:19:58,600
To kill you.

863
01:19:59,200 --> 01:20:01,800
Yeah. And if you're not lucky enough?

864
01:20:02,200 --> 01:20:03,700
That'd be hell.

865
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:08,400
The guys down at the station
would have to chip in and buy a TV.

866
01:20:08,500 --> 01:20:10,200
You're a great comfort, Sergeant.

867
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,200
You will change the locks?

868
01:20:41,800 --> 01:20:42,800
Hi.

869
01:20:43,200 --> 01:20:47,800
Nothing like a nice brisk walk in the woods
to put roses on a girl's cheeks.

870
01:20:48,700 --> 01:20:50,000
How are you?

871
01:20:51,300 --> 01:20:53,000
Not so good, honey.

872
01:20:57,200 --> 01:20:59,000
- She's back.
- Who?

873
01:21:01,400 --> 01:21:04,400
Evelyn Draper,
the girl who tried to kill Birdie.

874
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:07,200
How can she be back?

875
01:21:07,300 --> 01:21:10,300
I thought they'd put her
in a state sanitarium.

876
01:21:10,900 --> 01:21:14,800
- They did, but they let her out.
- Does that mean she's all right?

877
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:17,600
Theoretically.

878
01:21:21,800 --> 01:21:23,400
What happens now?

879
01:21:26,900 --> 01:21:31,200
I think you and I ought to stay away
from each other for a couple of days...

880
01:21:31,300 --> 01:21:33,900
...just in case she's tagging after me.

881
01:21:36,200 --> 01:21:38,100
She's already following you, isn't she?

882
01:21:38,700 --> 01:21:41,400
I don't want you to worry about it.
I can handle myself.

883
01:21:41,500 --> 01:21:43,400
Yeah. So could Birdie.

884
01:21:59,700 --> 01:22:01,900
All right then, you stand by.

885
01:22:05,500 --> 01:22:08,100
They're all set to trace the call.

886
01:22:08,300 --> 01:22:11,400
When she phones, just mention her
by name right away, Evelyn...

887
01:22:11,500 --> 01:22:13,400
...and they start to trace her.

888
01:22:13,500 --> 01:22:16,200
All you gotta do after that
is just keep her talking.

889
01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:25,200
Fifteen minutes
before the hour here at KRML...

890
01:22:25,300 --> 01:22:27,700
...and here's It's Not Unusual.

891
01:22:33,400 --> 01:22:35,400
I guess it hasn't come to you yet.

892
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:38,100
- What?
- What she said.

893
01:22:38,700 --> 01:22:41,500
Over the phone last night?
Part of a poem or something.

894
01:22:41,600 --> 01:22:43,400
You were gonna try to remember.

895
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:47,200
I thought I had that, but I've forgotten.
Is it that important?

896
01:22:47,700 --> 01:22:49,900
Until we pick her up,
everything's important.

897
01:22:55,200 --> 01:22:56,600
What's wrong?

898
01:22:57,100 --> 01:22:59,800
I'm worried about my girlfriend
with all this going on.

899
01:22:59,900 --> 01:23:02,400
They're so damn isolated down there.

900
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:06,400
I'm thinking the best thing to do
is just have Al Monte sub for me.

901
01:23:06,500 --> 01:23:09,600
The only chance we've got
is when she phones in here tonight.

902
01:23:09,700 --> 01:23:11,600
You've got to be here, right on that mike.

903
01:23:11,700 --> 01:23:14,500
- Lf she phones.
- She will. Believe me.

904
01:23:15,300 --> 01:23:17,300
But only if you're here.

905
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:21,000
I'll tell you what I'll do.

906
01:23:21,100 --> 01:23:26,000
If it'll make you feel better, I'll go over
and check your girlfriend's house myself.

907
01:23:26,500 --> 01:23:28,700
I'd sure appreciate that.

908
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:33,600
She lives on Spindrift Road.
I think it's the fourth or fifth house down.

909
01:23:33,700 --> 01:23:36,900
- "Williams" is on the mailbox.
- Why don't you phone her?

910
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,500
- Okay.
- Tell her to be expecting me.

911
01:23:39,700 --> 01:23:41,000
McCallum.

912
01:23:42,300 --> 01:23:43,500
Thanks.

913
01:23:43,900 --> 01:23:45,300
Public servant.

914
01:23:56,100 --> 01:23:59,600
- Hello?
- Hi. I'm just checking in. You all right?

915
01:23:59,900 --> 01:24:01,400
Marvelous.

916
01:24:01,500 --> 01:24:05,700
I'm just getting ready to do my nails
and I got your program on.

917
01:24:05,900 --> 01:24:09,100
And Annabel's in the kitchen
making a couple of coffee grogs.

918
01:24:09,300 --> 01:24:11,100
What more could a girl ask for?

919
01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:13,200
No, honey, everything's fine.

920
01:24:13,300 --> 01:24:16,800
There's a Sgt. McCallum
that's gonna drop by for a second...

921
01:24:16,900 --> 01:24:20,300
...to see if you've buttoned up all right.
Let him in, but nobody else.

922
01:24:20,800 --> 01:24:21,900
Okay.

923
01:24:22,100 --> 01:24:26,700
David, you want to play something
soft and dreamy for us?

924
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:29,400
You got it. Bye-bye.

925
01:24:30,200 --> 01:24:31,500
'Bye, hon.

926
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:40,000
- Annabel, how's that stuff coming?
- Here's something soft and sentimental...

927
01:24:40,100 --> 01:24:42,800
...for Tobie and Annabel.

928
01:24:45,900 --> 01:24:47,900
Hope you like cinnamon in yours.

929
01:24:48,600 --> 01:24:49,900
Whatever's right.

930
01:24:59,100 --> 01:25:00,800
Annabel.

931
01:25:13,700 --> 01:25:14,800
Good?

932
01:25:15,400 --> 01:25:16,900
Too much.

933
01:25:22,100 --> 01:25:24,500
- So is this.
- Thank you.

934
01:25:25,700 --> 01:25:27,700
Just one thing. Do you mind?

935
01:25:28,200 --> 01:25:29,500
No, be my guest.

936
01:25:30,900 --> 01:25:32,600
The eyes are wrong.

937
01:25:35,700 --> 01:25:37,400
David's are more...

938
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:39,600
How shall I say?

939
01:25:40,700 --> 01:25:41,900
Colder.

940
01:25:42,900 --> 01:25:44,400
I didn't know you knew David.

941
01:25:46,100 --> 01:25:48,300
I didn't realize you and David...

942
01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:51,600
...were friends.

943
01:25:52,300 --> 01:25:53,500
Friends?

944
01:25:58,600 --> 01:26:00,200
No, not friends.

945
01:26:03,800 --> 01:26:05,200
Not friends.

946
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:21,600
God, you're dumb.

947
01:26:58,600 --> 01:27:01,000
"Because this maiden
she lived with no other thought

948
01:27:01,100 --> 01:27:03,200
"Than to love and be loved by you."

949
01:27:22,100 --> 01:27:25,500
- Tobie?
- We're waiting for you, David.

950
01:27:50,900 --> 01:27:53,600
This is Dave Garver with a little verse...

951
01:27:53,700 --> 01:27:55,800
...a little talk and five hours of music...

952
01:27:55,900 --> 01:27:58,500
...to be very, very nice to each other by.

953
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:42,800
Careful.

954
01:28:47,200 --> 01:28:48,400
Careful.

955
01:28:49,500 --> 01:28:51,400
I might put your eye out.

956
01:28:57,500 --> 01:28:59,700
I'll bet David loves your eyes.

957
01:29:13,500 --> 01:29:15,000
And your hair.

958
01:29:22,300 --> 01:29:25,100
Does he run his fingers through your hair?

959
01:29:35,200 --> 01:29:37,200
Have to get you all nice for David.

960
01:29:40,700 --> 01:29:42,000
For David.

961
01:29:51,800 --> 01:29:54,700
I hope he likes what he sees
when he walks in here...

962
01:29:55,800 --> 01:29:59,000
...because that's what
he's taking to hell with him.

963
01:30:59,800 --> 01:31:01,200
Miss Williams?

964
01:32:35,900 --> 01:32:37,100
McCallum?

965
01:36:39,100 --> 01:36:44,100
And now we have a pretty one
for lonely lovers on a cool, cool night.

966
01:36:44,600 --> 01:36:47,500
It's the great Erroll Garner classic, Misty.

967
01:36:47,700 --> 01:36:50,400
And this one is especially for Evelyn.
