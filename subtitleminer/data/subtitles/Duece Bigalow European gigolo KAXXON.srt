00:00:59,096 --> 00:01:00,764
My husband.

2
00:01:01,599 --> 00:01:02,850
Thank you for last night.

3
00:01:17,697 --> 00:01:19,323
Thank you for last night.

4
00:01:37,965 --> 00:01:39,717
Thank you for last night.

5
00:02:09,161 --> 00:02:10,745
Hey, what do you think
you're doing?

6
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:13,665
Shit.

7
00:02:27,636 --> 00:02:32,724
Today, these visually-impaired senior
citizens will fulfill a lifelong dream:

8
00:02:35,476 --> 00:02:37,103
To swim with dolphins.

9
00:02:39,522 --> 00:02:40,731
Hey, check this out.

10
00:02:41,732 --> 00:02:43,942
- What is that?
- Careful.

11
00:02:44,151 --> 00:02:46,194
That is four years of research.

12
00:02:46,361 --> 00:02:49,990
A technological breakthrough
which might just save a life or two.

13
00:02:50,198 --> 00:02:51,908
- What's it for?
- A device to prevent...

14
00:02:52,033 --> 00:02:53,826
...the beaching of cetaceans.

15
00:02:53,993 --> 00:02:56,746
- That's whales to you and me.
- Cetaceans, huh?

16
00:02:56,913 --> 00:02:59,040
That's a pretty big word
for a man-whore.

17
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:04,044
I'm not a man-whore.

18
00:03:04,253 --> 00:03:06,296
I'm a fish enthusiast.

19
00:03:06,546 --> 00:03:08,298
I stopped man-whoring
when I met my wife.

20
00:03:08,507 --> 00:03:10,675
My mom said your wife
got eaten on your honeymoon...

21
00:03:10,842 --> 00:03:12,552
...because you tried
to feed the sharks.

22
00:03:12,677 --> 00:03:15,263
You tell your mom I was
trying to feed the turtles.

23
00:03:15,388 --> 00:03:17,557
Didn't realize there was
meat sauce on the lettuce.

24
00:03:17,765 --> 00:03:20,976
Whatever. I bet that thing doesn't
even work, you stupid he-bitch.

25
00:03:21,143 --> 00:03:23,520
- Come on, I got it.
- Hey, you little bastards.

26
00:03:23,812 --> 00:03:25,898
Give that back! That's not a toy!

27
00:03:27,482 --> 00:03:29,693
That's the one. That's your grandma.

28
00:03:29,859 --> 00:03:31,611
Give me..! Come on! Give me..!

29
00:03:41,912 --> 00:03:44,915
Something seems to be going wrong.
I'm not sure what's happening.

30
00:03:48,251 --> 00:03:49,628
I gotcha! I got..!

31
00:04:01,013 --> 00:04:03,140
Hey, everybody. I'm home.

32
00:04:07,185 --> 00:04:09,646
Hi, Kate. I missed you today.

33
00:04:10,814 --> 00:04:12,941
The prototype's almost working.

34
00:04:13,233 --> 00:04:14,901
All it needs is a few
minor adjustments.

35

<i>Wes Takahashi in Malibu, where
three blind swimmers are missing. </i>

36

<i>I hope that man rots in hell!</i>

37
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:28,914
<i>It was some weird guy.
He tried to touch my ball...</i>

38
00:04:35,878 --> 00:04:38,130
<i>- Hello?
- Deucey, Deucey, Deucey. </i>

39
00:04:38,297 --> 00:04:39,882
<i>It's your old buddy T.J. Here. </i>

40
00:04:40,132 --> 00:04:42,009
<i>- T.J?
- I'm in Amsterdam. </i>

41
00:04:42,176 --> 00:04:45,137
Man, you'd love it here. It's like
Disneyland for college students.

42
00:04:45,429 --> 00:04:46,555
You wouldn't believe this.

43
00:04:46,722 --> 00:04:49,599
<i>Why don't you come and let your
friend T.J. Show you a good time. </i>

44
00:04:49,808 --> 00:04:51,768
- Oh, that's crazy. I can't.
- Look.

45
00:04:51,976 --> 00:04:54,312
It ain't like you got something
better to do over there.

46
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:56,314
Amsterdam is so far away.

47
00:04:56,522 --> 00:04:59,650
<i>Police have just released a sketch
of a man wanted for questioning. </i>

48
00:04:59,817 --> 00:05:03,987
<i>Witnesses report he is goofy-looking
and probably a virgin. </i>

49
00:05:04,655 --> 00:05:07,407
On the other hand,
far away could be good.

50
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:11,870
Is my wife gonna be okay in there?

51
00:05:12,036 --> 00:05:14,289
- She'll be fine, sir.
- All right.

52
00:05:14,497 --> 00:05:17,625
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, Flight 10

53
00:05:17,792 --> 00:05:20,461
Excuse me.
I think there's been a mix-up.

54
00:05:21,545 --> 00:05:23,255
Oh, sorry. Sorry.

55
00:05:23,422 --> 00:05:26,383
That's okay. I always wondered
what it felt like to be a white woman.

56
00:05:27,384 --> 00:05:29,386
- Can I borrow it?
- Give me that.

57
00:05:30,387 --> 00:05:31,346
Hold on.

58
00:05:31,721 --> 00:05:34,349
<i>All rows now boarding

59
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:42,940
Excuse me.

60
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:44,358
Okay.

61
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:56,119
Hey, how many people
get to do this on their honeymoon?

62
00:05:56,911 --> 00:05:58,663
You're sure it's safe
to feed the turtles?

63
00:05:58,871 --> 00:06:02,416
You have nothing to worry about.
I'm a fish expert, remember?

64
00:06:03,709 --> 00:06:05,586
What is that over there?

65
00:06:05,878 --> 00:06:08,964
Oh, that's just some kid with a fin
on his back, trying to scare us.

66
00:06:09,256 --> 00:06:11,132
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

67
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,510
Do you think the hotel would let us
swim if there were sharks?

68
00:06:15,595 --> 00:06:19,515
Come on. This is Mexico.

69
00:06:20,599 --> 00:06:22,559
They know what they're doing.

70
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:35,947
This shirt's gonna be
a great icebreaker.

71
00:06:36,114 --> 00:06:38,949
Fuck you, American,
you imperialist bastard!

72
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:42,411
I love America.
I love President Bush.

73
00:06:42,578 --> 00:06:44,955
Thank you for bringing
democracy to Iraq.

74
00:06:45,164 --> 00:06:47,416
- Shut up!
- Oh, shit!

75
00:06:49,251 --> 00:06:51,252
Oh, hello. Sir.

76
00:06:51,628 --> 00:06:54,505
- Is this okay?
- You did miss a spot.

77
00:07:00,177 --> 00:07:01,428
Did I get it?

78
00:07:01,971 --> 00:07:04,098
Put some elbow in it.

79
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:07,517
Sorry, honey.

80
00:07:13,398 --> 00:07:14,983
What's with all these red lights?

81
00:07:16,234 --> 00:07:18,611
I wonder if they know
their curtains are open.

82
00:07:21,363 --> 00:07:22,573
Oh, man.

83
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,910
Ahoy there!

84
00:07:27,411 --> 00:07:29,412
Big Deucey in Amsterdam.

85
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:32,415
Man, get on over here.

86
00:07:33,124 --> 00:07:34,751
Deucey.

87
00:07:35,293 --> 00:07:37,503
- Look at this boat.
- Check this out.

88
00:07:42,258 --> 00:07:43,842
You like that?

89
00:07:49,431 --> 00:07:50,932
I couldn't be happier for you.

90
00:07:51,099 --> 00:07:52,642
Come, let me
show you my float-crib.

91
00:07:52,934 --> 00:07:55,895
- Okay.
- Looking like money.

92
00:07:56,062 --> 00:07:59,398
I'm telling you, you gonna have
a good time, man, huh?

93
00:08:00,858 --> 00:08:03,360
Well, it ain't much, but it's home.

94
00:08:05,487 --> 00:08:08,115
It's nice.
I like what you've done with it.

95
00:08:08,323 --> 00:08:11,493
Now, if you gotta use the bathroom,
lift up the toilet seat.

96
00:08:11,659 --> 00:08:13,703
This is where I live.
This is my home.

97
00:08:13,912 --> 00:08:16,497
I don't want nobody
pissing on my toilet seat.

98
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,709
What do you think of the float-crib?
You feeling it?

99
00:08:20,876 --> 00:08:23,670
T.J., I think you got a bad leak here.

100
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:25,380
No, no, no. It's just high tide.

101
00:08:26,715 --> 00:08:29,050
Is that what I think it is?

102
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:32,137
Yeah. I brought Kate.

103
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:34,889
I really wanna show her
a good time, you know?

104
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:37,058
Maybe buy her a wooden shoe.

105
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:40,019
Deucey.

106
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:44,273
Keeping that leg is kind of creepy.

107
00:08:44,648 --> 00:08:47,359
- You gotta move on with your life.
- T.J!

108
00:08:49,528 --> 00:08:50,945
Hey, Lil' Kim, what's up?

109
00:08:51,112 --> 00:08:52,947
I no more man-whore.
Too much danger.

110
00:08:55,658 --> 00:08:57,076
Excuse us for a moment, Deucey.

111
00:08:59,495 --> 00:09:00,746
Listen up, Lil' Kim.

112
00:09:00,913 --> 00:09:03,957
When your little bony ass had SARS,
who got you out of quarantine?

113
00:09:04,917 --> 00:09:07,210
- Go make me some money.
- No way!

114
00:09:07,377 --> 00:09:09,296
I take my three inches elsewhere.

115
00:09:14,884 --> 00:09:17,053
So I thought I'd come over here
and make a killing.

116
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,138
Got myself a houseboat, some ho's.

117
00:09:19,347 --> 00:09:21,390
The only thing a woman love
more than a man-ho...

118
00:09:21,599 --> 00:09:23,809
...is a floating man-ho.
- Makes sense.

119
00:09:23,976 --> 00:09:26,019
Then all these man-whore
murders started.

120
00:09:26,311 --> 00:09:28,271
My he-bitches got too scared
to go to work.

121
00:09:28,438 --> 00:09:29,898
What kind of world do we live in...

122
00:09:30,106 --> 00:09:32,650
...where the streets ain't safe
for male prostitutes?

123
00:09:32,901 --> 00:09:34,736
Here's your hashish.

124
00:09:35,653 --> 00:09:37,697
- Enjoy.
- Hashish?

125
00:09:37,863 --> 00:09:39,657
- Yeah.
- No.

126
00:09:41,784 --> 00:09:43,285
I thought this was a coffee shop.

127
00:09:43,452 --> 00:09:45,871
Let me break it down for you.
You're in Amsterdam.

128
00:09:46,038 --> 00:09:48,748
If you want coffee, you go to a café.

129
00:09:48,915 --> 00:09:52,919
If you want marijuana, ganji or some
freaky-deaky, you go to a coffee shop.

130
00:09:53,127 --> 00:09:54,796
That's where you is now.

131
00:10:02,469 --> 00:10:05,055
Put that away. Cops. Cops!

132
00:10:05,889 --> 00:10:07,766
Hold it right there.

133
00:10:14,397 --> 00:10:17,817
Now, that joint looks loose.
If you want, I'll roll the next one.

134
00:10:18,859 --> 00:10:20,569
Have a good evening, huh?

135
00:10:21,695 --> 00:10:24,031
Oh, don't worry about it, Deucey.
This is Amsterdam.

136
00:10:24,156 --> 00:10:26,325
It's perfectly legal over here.
You want a hit?

137
00:10:26,491 --> 00:10:28,452
No. I'm not smoking nothing.

138
00:10:28,618 --> 00:10:29,911
Oh, come on, man.

139
00:10:30,203 --> 00:10:32,205
- Deucey don't smoke.
- Suit yourself.

140
00:10:32,372 --> 00:10:34,707
Well, well, well,
if it ain't Heinz Hummer...

141
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:37,001
...the gigolo with the most below.

142
00:10:37,168 --> 00:10:38,711
What do you want, T.J? I'm busy.

143
00:10:38,878 --> 00:10:41,213
I wanna introduce you to my friend,
Deuce Bigalow.

144
00:10:41,338 --> 00:10:43,966
- He's a gigolo from America.
- Hi.

145
00:10:47,969 --> 00:10:50,055
Sometimes you're really funny, T.J.

146
00:10:50,221 --> 00:10:52,474
How much you getting
for a Filthy Ramirez these days?

147
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,808
I could get you more.

148
00:10:53,975 --> 00:10:55,935
A Filthy Ramirez?
Where have you been?

149
00:10:56,144 --> 00:10:57,728
Nobody pays for that shit anymore.

150
00:10:57,895 --> 00:10:59,188
See you around, T.J.

151
00:10:59,397 --> 00:11:00,815
The Man-whore Awards
are coming up.

152
00:11:00,981 --> 00:11:02,399
You wanna win the Golden Boner?

153
00:11:02,524 --> 00:11:04,109
I already won it twice.

154
00:11:04,276 --> 00:11:05,903
Just ask your ex-fiancée.

155
00:11:06,653 --> 00:11:08,738
Man, why you gotta bring up
Delisha like that?

156
00:11:10,699 --> 00:11:12,742
I can't believe prostitution's
legal here.

157
00:11:12,951 --> 00:11:15,453
Oh, yeah, it's big business.
They got a union, dental plan.

158
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:18,372
Man, if I had a he-bitch
like Heinz Hummer...

159
00:11:18,539 --> 00:11:20,291
...put me back in the game.

160
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:22,418
- Is he that good?
- "Is he that good?"

161
00:11:22,584 --> 00:11:25,045
They don't call him "Lord
of the Wangs" for nothing.

162
00:11:25,462 --> 00:11:27,255
Man, what I wouldn't give...

163
00:11:27,714 --> 00:11:28,882
For Heinz's wang?

164
00:11:29,591 --> 00:11:32,177
No, I don't want Heinz's wang!
I want him as a client.

165
00:11:33,845 --> 00:11:35,513
Hey, man, keep your voice down.

166
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,599
Talking about me wanting
Heinz's big juicy wang.

167
00:11:38,808 --> 00:11:39,934
People would think I'm gay.

168
00:11:40,851 --> 00:11:43,103
Now, a pimp's only got
one thing in this world:

169
00:11:43,228 --> 00:11:44,730
His reputation.

170
00:11:44,855 --> 00:11:47,607
Here you are, gentlemen.
Fresh today.

171
00:11:48,942 --> 00:11:50,568
- What is this?
- Spacecake.

172
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:54,030
- Why do they call it that?
- You know...

173
00:11:54,238 --> 00:11:56,407
...it's what the astronauts eat.
Like Tang.

174
00:11:59,535 --> 00:12:01,328
I'm starving.

175
00:12:03,831 --> 00:12:06,792
- It's a little dry.
- Keep eating. It gets better.

176
00:12:07,959 --> 00:12:10,128
- You sure you don't want any?
- No.

177
00:12:10,253 --> 00:12:13,173
Never been high, never gonna be.

178
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:16,384
This is pretty good cake, though.

179
00:12:17,218 --> 00:12:18,469
Fucking excellent.

180
00:12:52,417 --> 00:12:53,960
You.

181
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:57,588
Come on in here.

182
00:12:58,047 --> 00:12:59,757
You..? You want me to..?

183
00:12:59,924 --> 00:13:01,342
Yes, you.

184
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:22,569
- Maybe you can help me.
- Really?

185
00:13:22,736 --> 00:13:26,490
I don't want a man who's
chiseled and sculpted.

186
00:13:27,115 --> 00:13:29,784
I like soft and weak.

187
00:13:29,951 --> 00:13:33,037
- You do?
- I want a man who's unemployed.

188
00:13:34,372 --> 00:13:36,833
And went to a community college.

189
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:39,293
I am, and I did.

190
00:13:39,502 --> 00:13:42,171
- You know what really turns me on?
- What?

191
00:13:42,379 --> 00:13:45,007
Is thinking about him
in his tighty whities...

192
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:47,050
...sitting at his computer...

193
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:49,594
...and visiting different porn sites...

194
00:13:49,761 --> 00:13:54,140
...and taking the free tour
with no intention of ever joining.

195
00:13:54,307 --> 00:13:55,850
I don't have a credit card!

196
00:13:56,017 --> 00:13:58,853
- Kiss my chest.
- Okay.

197
00:14:00,354 --> 00:14:01,897
Harder!

198
00:14:02,273 --> 00:14:03,440
- Bite me!
- You sure?

199
00:14:03,565 --> 00:14:04,942
Harder! Bite me harder!

200
00:14:07,069 --> 00:14:10,405
Get off of my titty,
you doped-up cracker!

201
00:14:12,824 --> 00:14:15,159
No more spacecakes for you.

202
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:21,624
Hey. I'm sorry about that, T.J.
I must have gotten a contact buzz.

203
00:14:21,832 --> 00:14:23,834
What'd I tell you about
making me look gay?

204
00:14:24,001 --> 00:14:26,003
Not ten minutes go by
and you got your mouth...

205
00:14:26,169 --> 00:14:27,671
...all over my breasteses.

206
00:14:27,879 --> 00:14:29,089
My nipple's ruined!

207
00:14:29,548 --> 00:14:31,508
You're lucky I was born with a spare.

208
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:36,095
There go one of my ho's.

209
00:14:36,387 --> 00:14:38,222
The old guy in the walker's
one of your ho's?

210
00:14:38,431 --> 00:14:41,892
Yeah. Why ain't his ancient ass
out there making me my money?

211
00:14:42,142 --> 00:14:45,145
Kaiser! Get your old ass
back in the booth!

212
00:14:45,395 --> 00:14:47,564
Deucey, meet me back
at the float-crib.

213
00:14:48,148 --> 00:14:50,859
Bitches out here act like
they never seen a pimp before.

214
00:14:51,109 --> 00:14:54,988
I raise my hand, they look at it like
it's a goddamn croissant. Then:

215
00:14:56,405 --> 00:14:58,324
Feel my pimp hand.

216
00:15:00,743 --> 00:15:01,911
Where's the boat?

217
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:16,007
Oh. You scared me.

218
00:15:18,217 --> 00:15:20,261
Hey. Do you know who I am?

219
00:15:20,427 --> 00:15:24,723
I am Heinz Hummer. I'm the gigolo
with the most below. Okay?

220
00:15:24,932 --> 00:15:27,309
I can give you a Filthy Lopez
like you never had before.

221
00:15:27,601 --> 00:15:30,145
I could give you
a Cambodian Creamsicle...

222
00:15:30,312 --> 00:15:32,439
...that will make you
scream all night. Okay?

223
00:15:32,605 --> 00:15:35,900
But not now because I'm busy.
So leave me alone, bitch.

224
00:15:38,611 --> 00:15:40,654
Wait a second. Do I know you?

225
00:15:44,116 --> 00:15:46,827
"New-jizz-fizz...

226
00:15:48,161 --> 00:15:50,830
...ver-bur-ger-king... "?

227
00:16:03,634 --> 00:16:05,177
Heinz.

228
00:16:11,808 --> 00:16:13,685
Man, are you wasted.

229
00:16:18,606 --> 00:16:20,065
I gotcha.

230
00:16:21,817 --> 00:16:23,694
<i>Coming up next, more weather. </i>

231
00:16:25,445 --> 00:16:26,863
What's this?

232
00:16:28,615 --> 00:16:30,450
Hey, Heinz, wake up, check this out.

233
00:16:32,452 --> 00:16:34,120
Holy shit.

234
00:16:35,455 --> 00:16:37,707
Europe just got a little better.

235
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:41,919
Damn. That old Kaiser's got legs.

236
00:16:42,544 --> 00:16:44,880
- You gotta keep your bitches in line.
- Yeah.

237
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:48,592
- What's he doing here?
- I found him passed out in the alley.

238
00:16:48,967 --> 00:16:51,052
I couldn't just leave him there.

239
00:16:51,261 --> 00:16:52,512
I put in a good word for you.

240
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:54,972
Thanks, Deucey. Much appreciated.

241
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:57,141
I knew you'd come around.

242
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:02,688
Oh, shit. Heinz ain't passed out.
Heinz is dead.

243
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:07,317
No. He can't be.

244
00:17:07,567 --> 00:17:10,904
I'm telling you, Heinz is dead.
See for yourself.

245
00:17:16,117 --> 00:17:17,368
Watch this.

246
00:17:22,998 --> 00:17:24,917
Maybe he's just a heavy sleeper.

247
00:17:31,006 --> 00:17:33,424
I can't believe you brought
a dead man-whore in my home.

248
00:17:33,591 --> 00:17:36,260
- What were you thinking?
- I didn't know you could die from pot.

249
00:17:36,427 --> 00:17:39,972
This is no pot-related fatality.
This is no ganja accident.

250
00:17:40,181 --> 00:17:41,849
This man was murdered.

251
00:17:44,268 --> 00:17:45,727
The Man-whore Killer did this?

252
00:17:48,647 --> 00:17:51,232
- We gotta call the police.
- No, no, no! Hey, hey!

253
00:17:51,358 --> 00:17:52,775
Goddamn, white boy.

254
00:17:52,984 --> 00:17:55,153
You think the police gonna believe
a black pimp...

255
00:17:55,278 --> 00:17:57,822
...had nothing to do with a dead
prosti-dude in his crib?

256
00:18:07,914 --> 00:18:10,625
Before I toss your dumb ass
in the canal, I just wanna say...

257
00:18:10,792 --> 00:18:12,877
...for the record,
under T.J.'s management...

258
00:18:13,044 --> 00:18:14,921
...this would have never happened.

259
00:18:18,341 --> 00:18:21,135
I just gotta see
what all the fuss was about.

260
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:26,932
Goddamn!

261
00:18:27,557 --> 00:18:29,684
No wonder Delisha never came back.

262
00:18:29,893 --> 00:18:32,520
That shit's the real
Loch Ness monster.

263
00:18:34,147 --> 00:18:35,565
What's over there?

264
00:18:37,441 --> 00:18:39,610
- Look where his hand is.
- What the shit is this?

265
00:18:40,694 --> 00:18:43,197
What you looking at?
Turn off them damn cameras!

266
00:18:43,447 --> 00:18:45,949
I ain't gay! I was only
looking down his pants...

267
00:18:46,116 --> 00:18:48,285
...because I heard his schlong
was so big and juicy.

268
00:18:48,493 --> 00:18:50,996
Wait a minute.
That didn't sound right.

269
00:18:51,204 --> 00:18:53,081
- Perv!
- Give me them damn cameras.

270
00:18:55,792 --> 00:18:56,918
Where is he?

271
00:18:57,126 --> 00:19:00,421
<i>We now interrupt Naked Seinfeld
for this special report. </i>

272
00:19:00,588 --> 00:19:02,089
<i>The suspected Man-whore Killer... </i>

273
00:19:02,298 --> 00:19:04,341

274

<i>... attempting to dispose
of his latest victim. </i>

Tiberius Jefferson Hicks. </i>

277

- Hold it!</i>

279
00:19:16,727 --> 00:19:18,271
Hey. Hey, guys! How's it going?

280
00:19:19,146 --> 00:19:21,148
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

281
00:19:23,525 --> 00:19:25,986
- Where is he?
- I swear I don't know.

282
00:19:27,112 --> 00:19:29,531
Your loyalty is impressive, sir.

283
00:19:30,073 --> 00:19:33,243
You've once been arrested for
man-whoring, were you not?

284
00:19:33,451 --> 00:19:35,370
Look, I wasn't really man-whoring...

285
00:19:35,536 --> 00:19:39,415
Please, Mr. Bigalow.
I've heard this a thousand times.

286
00:19:39,582 --> 00:19:41,792
You were cold, you were frightened.

287
00:19:41,917 --> 00:19:44,128
He took you under his arm
and fed you.

288
00:19:44,294 --> 00:19:46,004
He made you feel sexy.

289
00:19:46,171 --> 00:19:49,299
He told you how to hide money
in every orifice.

290
00:19:49,424 --> 00:19:52,969
But your friend is obviously a killer.

291
00:19:53,136 --> 00:19:54,387
T.J.'s not a killer.

292
00:19:55,304 --> 00:19:57,098
If he isn't a murderer...

293
00:19:57,265 --> 00:20:00,101
...then what was he doing
checking out a dead man's penis?

294
00:20:00,768 --> 00:20:02,978
I guess he was curious.

295
00:20:03,395 --> 00:20:06,523
He heard it was big and juicy...

296
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:08,900
...and wanted to see for himself.

297
00:20:09,067 --> 00:20:10,360
A lot of guys do that.

298
00:20:12,654 --> 00:20:15,865
No, they don't.

299
00:20:17,033 --> 00:20:18,617
Okay.

300
00:20:19,326 --> 00:20:20,619
T.J.'s gay.

301
00:20:20,995 --> 00:20:24,748
- Really?
- Not normal-gay, but, you know...

302
00:20:25,165 --> 00:20:27,709
...crazy-gay, you know?

303
00:20:28,335 --> 00:20:30,754
Musical-theater-gay.

304
00:20:32,338 --> 00:20:34,215
Is that why he puts lipstick...

305
00:20:35,591 --> 00:20:38,177
...on all his victims?

306
00:20:39,428 --> 00:20:40,846
Wait a minute.

307
00:20:41,055 --> 00:20:44,516
In the alley, I heard
someone whistling.

308
00:20:44,933 --> 00:20:46,226
And I saw someone.

309
00:20:48,562 --> 00:20:50,230
A woman...

310
00:20:51,481 --> 00:20:53,900
...in a leopard coat.

311
00:20:54,776 --> 00:20:58,321
People see a lot of crazy things
when they're high on spacecake.

312
00:20:58,529 --> 00:21:00,489
There's drugs in spacecake?

313
00:21:00,698 --> 00:21:04,493
Mr. Bigalow, I will find your pimp
whether you help me or not.

314
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:13,084
- T.J., thank God you're here.
- How'd you find me?

315
00:21:13,251 --> 00:21:15,545
It's the only chicken
and waffle place in Holland.

316
00:21:15,711 --> 00:21:18,506
So a black man's gotta be
at a chicken and waffles place?

317
00:21:18,589 --> 00:21:19,965
That's racist.

318
00:21:20,591 --> 00:21:23,844
- But you are here.
- Yeah, but figuring it out is racist.

319
00:21:26,305 --> 00:21:28,640
- It's a nice place.
- Did you know Holland invented...

320
00:21:28,765 --> 00:21:30,809
...chicken and waffles?
- Really?

321
00:21:30,975 --> 00:21:33,770
Before that, you could only
get chicken or waffles.

322
00:21:33,978 --> 00:21:36,772
But they were the first
to put them together.

323
00:21:37,148 --> 00:21:40,693
Black people all over the world will be
forever grateful to the Dutch for that.

324
00:21:40,818 --> 00:21:42,986
You do know the Dutch
started the slave trade.

325
00:21:43,487 --> 00:21:45,614
Those motherfuckers!

326
00:21:51,828 --> 00:21:53,162
Who let them print this?

327
00:21:53,371 --> 00:21:57,166
Look, we're gonna prove
that you didn't kill anyone.

328
00:21:57,375 --> 00:22:00,503
I don't give a damn about that.
It's the "extremely gay" part.

329
00:22:00,628 --> 00:22:03,213
If I'm a murderer, they'll welcome
me home with open arms.

330
00:22:03,422 --> 00:22:05,132
Get out of jail and
become a huge rapper.

331
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:06,758
But a gay pimp?

332
00:22:06,925 --> 00:22:09,844
- Like, where I'm going? Vermont?
- Look, T. J...

333
00:22:10,011 --> 00:22:11,888
...I think I saw the real killer.

334
00:22:12,097 --> 00:22:13,306
It was a woman.

335
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:16,184
Some she-john went
on a he-bitch killing spree...

336
00:22:16,267 --> 00:22:18,519
...because she wasn't satisfied
with a Filthy Lopez.

337
00:22:18,686 --> 00:22:21,272
- What's a Filthy Lopez?
- Forty bucks. Same as downtown.

338
00:22:21,438 --> 00:22:24,358
All we do is find the she-johns that
went out with the dead gigolos.

339
00:22:24,525 --> 00:22:26,234
- One of them is our killer.
- Makes sense.

340
00:22:26,443 --> 00:22:28,653
- You gotta get back on the horse.
- Horse? What horse?

341
00:22:28,862 --> 00:22:30,030
The man-whore horse.

342
00:22:30,155 --> 00:22:31,740
We gonna use your
white ass as bait.

343
00:22:31,906 --> 00:22:33,533
Bait? Look, I'm not man-whoring.

344
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,910
We'll find the killer
using your twat-sicle.

345
00:22:36,285 --> 00:22:39,663
Twat-sicle? Gross! No.

346
00:22:42,541 --> 00:22:44,293
Give this to my mama.

347
00:22:44,585 --> 00:22:46,837
Tell her I'm sorry I was
a disappointment to her.

348
00:22:47,004 --> 00:22:49,506
Sorry I called her friends
in the middle of the night...

349
00:22:49,673 --> 00:22:51,549
...when I was pleasuring myself.

350
00:22:51,674 --> 00:22:54,594
And tell her she don't have to worry
anymore about her baby.

351
00:22:56,888 --> 00:23:01,267
Even if I wanted to, how are we gonna
find a dead gigolo's customers?

352
00:23:01,433 --> 00:23:03,602
<i>We'll go to the man-whore union.
But be careful. </i>

353
00:23:03,727 --> 00:23:04,937
<i>They'll be looking for me. </i>

354
00:23:07,481 --> 00:23:11,067
Meeting of the Royal Order
of European Man-whores...

355
00:23:11,234 --> 00:23:13,444
...is now in session.

356
00:23:13,611 --> 00:23:16,072
These are the highest paid
he-bitches in Europe.

357
00:23:16,447 --> 00:23:18,991
That? That's Rodrigo.
He's from Spain.

358
00:23:19,158 --> 00:23:21,410
He can tie shoelaces
with his tongue.

359
00:23:22,411 --> 00:23:24,371
That? That's Enzo. He's Italian.

360
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:26,748
His nutsack is insured
for a million dollars.

361
00:23:26,957 --> 00:23:29,209
- That's 500 grand each.
- Check it out.

362
00:23:29,668 --> 00:23:31,378
That's Assapopulus from Greece.

363
00:23:31,503 --> 00:23:34,339
He can actually kiss you
with his butthole.

364
00:23:34,464 --> 00:23:35,923
I'd like to never see that.

365
00:23:36,257 --> 00:23:40,094
I'd like to say a few words about
our fallen comrade, Heinz Hummer.

366
00:23:40,302 --> 00:23:41,512
Who's the blond guy?

367
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,848
Chadsworth Buckingham.
Comes from a long line of ho's.

368
00:23:45,015 --> 00:23:47,809
His great-great-great grandmother
gave Henry VIII crabs.

369
00:23:48,018 --> 00:23:50,854
But I know Heinz would like to be
remembered for most...

370
00:23:51,479 --> 00:23:54,440
...was being a male prostitute.
- Hear, hear.

371
00:23:54,607 --> 00:23:57,318
He was also a supercilious cunt.

372
00:23:58,027 --> 00:24:01,572
- Who's that guy?
- Gian-Carlo. Silverback he-bitch.

373
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:04,575
Heinz Hummer was
undercutting all of us.

374
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,326
- What?
- Yes.

375
00:24:06,451 --> 00:24:09,204
He was charging the same price
for straight sex...

376
00:24:09,371 --> 00:24:11,581
...as he was for a
Turkish Snow Cone.

377
00:24:11,706 --> 00:24:13,666
<i>- What?
- Oh, yes.</i>

378
00:24:13,917 --> 00:24:17,920
He was also charging the same price
for a Belgian Steamer...

379
00:24:18,087 --> 00:24:21,131
...as he was for
a Portuguese Breakfast.

380
00:24:22,883 --> 00:24:25,719
As we sow, so shall we reap.

381
00:24:25,928 --> 00:24:28,889
Thank you, Gian-Carlo,
for those kind words.

382
00:24:29,055 --> 00:24:31,016
Until this insane killer
is apprehended...

383
00:24:31,182 --> 00:24:34,394
...the union is going to institute
a new security measure.

384
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:38,064
This ring locks snugly
over your va-guy-na...

385
00:24:39,023 --> 00:24:42,026
...and then communicates directly
with a global satellite system.

386
00:24:42,192 --> 00:24:46,071
There are rings of all sizes available,
smaller for our Asian members.

387
00:24:46,738 --> 00:24:48,115
Y'all know me.

388
00:24:49,074 --> 00:24:50,825
My name is McManus.

389
00:24:51,326 --> 00:24:55,747
I joined this union some
20-odd years ago for two reasons:

390
00:24:55,913 --> 00:24:58,499
To have intercourse
in exchange for cash...

391
00:24:58,666 --> 00:25:01,543
...and two, to protect me rights
as a man-whore.

392
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:02,878
But...

393
00:25:03,754 --> 00:25:05,422
...three years ago...

394
00:25:05,631 --> 00:25:09,718
...when this union
told we man-whores...

395
00:25:09,884 --> 00:25:13,888
...that we were to stop having
intercourse with underage girls...

396
00:25:14,097 --> 00:25:16,307
...I strongly disagreed.

397
00:25:16,474 --> 00:25:18,351
But I did not stand up.

398
00:25:18,684 --> 00:25:21,687
I'm ashamed to say I stood down!

399
00:25:22,146 --> 00:25:24,273
And then three months later...

400
00:25:24,439 --> 00:25:27,651
...this union told we man-whores...

401
00:25:27,818 --> 00:25:33,031
...that we were to begin washing our
private areas between customers.

402
00:25:33,239 --> 00:25:35,575
Our private areas.

403
00:25:36,367 --> 00:25:40,162
And once again, I'm ashamed
to report to you gentlemen...

404
00:25:40,788 --> 00:25:42,039
...I stood down!

405
00:25:42,831 --> 00:25:47,753
But now, sir, for what am I
to tell my 8-year-old boy...

406
00:25:48,044 --> 00:25:50,255
...when he comes to me
and he says:

407
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:52,257
"Daddy. Daddy.

408
00:25:52,423 --> 00:25:57,428
What's that thing hanging off
of your he-pussy?"

409
00:25:58,137 --> 00:26:00,014
How am I to tell him, sir?

410
00:26:06,228 --> 00:26:08,730
Deucey, you can do this.

411
00:26:08,855 --> 00:26:10,565
Due to high demand...

412
00:26:10,732 --> 00:26:13,693
...each member will be
only allowed two tickets...

413
00:26:13,818 --> 00:26:16,737
...to this year's Man-whore Awards.
- How's it going?

414
00:26:17,363 --> 00:26:20,491
I'm Deuce Bigalow.
I'm a gigolo from America.

415
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:24,828
My friend Tiberius Jefferson
is not the Man-whore Killer.

416
00:26:25,037 --> 00:26:26,288
Homo!

417
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:30,500
Now, I'm convinced
that the real killer...

418
00:26:31,709 --> 00:26:32,877
...is a she-john.

419
00:26:34,754 --> 00:26:37,006
Which means any one
of you could be next.

420
00:26:38,591 --> 00:26:40,843
Now, there are a couple hundred
gigolos in this room.

421
00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:43,303
Now, if we all work together...

422
00:26:43,512 --> 00:26:45,430
...we can find out
who the real killer is.

423
00:26:47,182 --> 00:26:48,808
What do you say?

424
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,233
How come you didn't
tell them I wasn't gay?

425
00:26:57,441 --> 00:27:00,277
Did you not just see me
get thrown through a window?

426
00:27:00,611 --> 00:27:02,529
- What do we do now?
- T.J. Has an old friend...

427
00:27:02,696 --> 00:27:06,533
...who just might be able to help us.
Come on. Watch your step.

428
00:27:08,451 --> 00:27:10,120
Right this way, please.

429
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:11,830
Deuce.

430
00:27:13,915 --> 00:27:15,666
Antoine?

431
00:27:16,167 --> 00:27:18,127
- Sit down.
- It's good to see you.

432
00:27:18,294 --> 00:27:19,462
It's been a long time.

433
00:27:25,217 --> 00:27:27,511
This is the list from
the man-whore union.

434
00:27:28,345 --> 00:27:31,806
It's got all the clients that went out
with the dead gigolos.

435
00:27:31,973 --> 00:27:33,224
Awesome!

436
00:27:37,395 --> 00:27:40,689
Please be quiet. I went through
a great deal of trouble to get this.

437
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:43,567
- Sorry.
- Now, if you want to compete...

438
00:27:43,692 --> 00:27:45,402
...with the European man-whores...

439
00:27:45,569 --> 00:27:48,738
...you need to learn how to really
please a woman.

440
00:27:49,072 --> 00:27:51,533
- I should write some of this down.
- Go ahead.

441
00:27:52,325 --> 00:27:55,370
You must be able
to pleasure a woman with...

442
00:27:56,621 --> 00:27:57,830
With your...

443
00:27:58,664 --> 00:27:59,999
Pleasure her with..?

444
00:28:04,753 --> 00:28:06,088
Do you want me to try?

445
00:28:14,887 --> 00:28:16,055
All right.

446
00:28:17,014 --> 00:28:18,933
Women really like that?

447
00:28:28,775 --> 00:28:30,193
Man-whore down.

448
00:28:34,822 --> 00:28:36,949
Get the list. It's in his pants.

449
00:28:37,158 --> 00:28:39,326
All right. I think I got it.

450
00:28:45,123 --> 00:28:47,542
Can't a brother stick his hand
down another man's pants...

451
00:28:47,751 --> 00:28:49,836
...without setting off
the faggot alarm?

452
00:28:51,921 --> 00:28:54,340
Marlene Alsmere.
She went out with Diego and Heinz.

453
00:28:54,549 --> 00:28:56,300
What am I gonna do
if she tries to kill me?

454
00:28:56,509 --> 00:28:59,095
Distract her with your magic she-nis,
I'll look for evidence.

455
00:28:59,261 --> 00:29:01,096
The lipstick and the leopard coat.

456
00:29:05,517 --> 00:29:09,771
All right. Hi, I'm Deuce Bigalow.
Hi, I'm Deuce Bigalow.

457
00:29:09,938 --> 00:29:12,899
Hi, I'm Deuce... Biggest lady
I've ever seen.

458
00:29:13,983 --> 00:29:16,027
That's a huge bitch.

459
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:20,906
Hi.

460
00:29:23,909 --> 00:29:25,327
Cute kids. Are they yours?

461
00:29:25,452 --> 00:29:29,623
Those pictures, they come with the
frames. I'm unable to have children.

462
00:29:30,165 --> 00:29:33,501
I'm so sorry. That must be
very hard for you.

463
00:29:42,051 --> 00:29:43,427
Evidence.

464
00:29:47,097 --> 00:29:48,849
That big ho got food everywhere.

465
00:29:50,433 --> 00:29:51,810
You're a nice man.

466
00:29:52,018 --> 00:29:54,103
Now, take off your clothes.

467
00:29:54,312 --> 00:29:57,315
Don't you wanna talk a little more?
You seem very interesting.

468
00:29:57,565 --> 00:29:59,108
Take them off!

469
00:30:01,819 --> 00:30:03,445
<i>"Dutch Bride. "</i>

470
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:27,259
Baby walk to Mommy.

471
00:30:28,135 --> 00:30:30,095
Come, come.

472
00:30:30,303 --> 00:30:32,555
No! Like baby!

473
00:30:32,722 --> 00:30:35,600
Baby walk to Mommy.

474
00:30:37,768 --> 00:30:39,645
Good baby.

475
00:30:45,234 --> 00:30:46,860
Come to Mommy.

476
00:30:53,116 --> 00:30:55,743
Baby hungry? Want booby?

477
00:30:57,787 --> 00:30:59,622
Baby never eat again.

478
00:31:11,549 --> 00:31:14,302
You like them big hairy balls,
don't you?

479
00:31:28,899 --> 00:31:31,359
Bad pussy! Bad pussy!

480
00:31:35,196 --> 00:31:36,405
Hold it!

481
00:31:36,614 --> 00:31:39,533
Hold it right there.
Is this truck full of marijuana?

482
00:31:39,658 --> 00:31:43,162
Is this truck full of marijuana?
Can't you read the sign?

483
00:31:43,287 --> 00:31:46,081
No unloading pot in the red zone.

484
00:31:46,373 --> 00:31:47,874
Write him up.

485
00:31:48,041 --> 00:31:50,585
- But, sir, it's my daughter's birthday.
- Inspector.

486
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:53,588
She's turning 13.
We need all this pot for the party.

487
00:31:53,796 --> 00:31:56,883
Inspector. I got these lipsticks
from Marlene Alsmere.

488
00:31:57,049 --> 00:31:59,176
She was a customer of Heinz.
She's big and strong.

489
00:31:59,343 --> 00:32:02,179
- She could easily be the killer.
- The lipstick the killer uses...

490
00:32:02,346 --> 00:32:03,555
...is a very rare one.

491
00:32:03,722 --> 00:32:09,436
Shimmer Lavender Love number 66.
Discontinued in 1984.

492
00:32:09,561 --> 00:32:10,645
But... But...

493
00:32:10,770 --> 00:32:14,482
Sir, I have a list of the women who
went out with the murdered gigolos.

494
00:32:15,149 --> 00:32:17,860
- Will you stop doing that?
- Will you stop playing these games...

495
00:32:18,027 --> 00:32:20,529
...and tell me where T.J.'s hiding?
- T.J.'s innocent.

496
00:32:20,696 --> 00:32:23,032
Oh, don't make me laugh.
"T.J.'s innocent. "

497
00:32:24,199 --> 00:32:26,743
Uncle! You forgot your lunch.

498
00:32:26,952 --> 00:32:29,246
That's very nice. Thanks.

499
00:32:34,459 --> 00:32:37,878
- Let me... Let me help you with that.
- Thank you.

500
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:42,049
Excuse me for asking...

501
00:32:42,216 --> 00:32:44,259
...but why did you
slap yourself like that?

502
00:32:45,677 --> 00:32:47,262
Promise you won't laugh?

503
00:32:47,846 --> 00:32:49,055
I promise.

504
00:32:50,849 --> 00:32:54,394
I have obsessive
compulsive disorder.

505
00:32:55,395 --> 00:32:58,773
I have these little rituals
that I can't help doing.

506
00:32:58,898 --> 00:33:02,318
I can't touch doorknobs,
I snap my fingers when I see a bus.

507
00:33:02,484 --> 00:33:05,070
And when someone sneezes,
I slap myself three times.

508
00:33:05,237 --> 00:33:07,489
I've heard of that. That's not so bad.

509
00:33:09,574 --> 00:33:12,118
I'm sorry. Bells make me do that.

510
00:33:12,911 --> 00:33:14,370
It got me kicked out of school.

511
00:33:14,537 --> 00:33:17,206
It's okay. Everyone's got
a few weird habits.

512
00:33:17,415 --> 00:33:20,751
Actually, I've got about 130.

513
00:33:21,835 --> 00:33:23,295
So you're above average.

514
00:33:24,296 --> 00:33:26,048
I mean...
I'm Deuce.

515
00:33:27,507 --> 00:33:29,426
I'm Eva.

516
00:33:30,552 --> 00:33:31,970
Is that a Sudanese Sweetlips?

517
00:33:32,178 --> 00:33:35,223
- How did you know?
- It's, like, my top-five favorite fish.

518
00:33:35,807 --> 00:33:38,017
They have one
here at the aquarium.

519
00:33:38,392 --> 00:33:39,977
I heard this place is incredible.

520
00:33:44,731 --> 00:33:46,483
The doorknob?

521
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:49,653
I'll get it. Okay.

522
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:52,906
Thanks. Thank you.

523
00:33:53,656 --> 00:33:54,949
He's beautiful.

524
00:33:55,783 --> 00:33:57,243
That's really good.

525
00:33:57,743 --> 00:33:59,286
Thank you.

526
00:34:11,047 --> 00:34:15,676
Excuse me, but in America they don't
allow smoking in aquariums.

527
00:34:17,261 --> 00:34:21,223
Well, in Europe, we don't unilaterally
attack a country just to steal their oil.

528
00:34:22,141 --> 00:34:23,517
What?

529
00:34:23,642 --> 00:34:27,479
"What?" Did I offend you?
Are you going to shock and awe me?

530
00:34:28,313 --> 00:34:31,274
Maybe you should check my pockets
for weapons of mass destruction!

531
00:34:31,441 --> 00:34:33,818
What? I just asked you
to put your cigarette out.

532
00:34:34,027 --> 00:34:35,194
And then what is next?

533
00:34:35,403 --> 00:34:37,321
Take wine away from my children?

534
00:34:37,655 --> 00:34:41,450
I put out this cigarette.
God bless America.

535
00:34:43,994 --> 00:34:46,330
The nicotine in that cigarette
is poisonous.

536
00:34:46,496 --> 00:34:49,082
- So they say.
- It could kill every fish in that tank.

537
00:34:49,249 --> 00:34:50,917
Poor little fishy.

538
00:34:53,586 --> 00:34:56,464
Hey. Why are you with that loser?

539
00:35:06,264 --> 00:35:08,391
You have a nice ass.

540
00:35:11,478 --> 00:35:13,396
I think this belongs to you.

541
00:35:19,443 --> 00:35:20,903
You dick!

542
00:35:21,278 --> 00:35:23,739
I would like to take you from behind.

543
00:35:27,159 --> 00:35:29,995
My penis is uncircumcised.

544
00:35:31,704 --> 00:35:33,373
No head.

545
00:35:33,539 --> 00:35:35,500
It's like a torpedo.

546
00:35:36,292 --> 00:35:39,962
- You pig.
- Oh, are you tired of swimming?

547
00:35:40,171 --> 00:35:43,507
Did the little fishies
not want to play with you?

548
00:35:54,225 --> 00:35:56,602
Fuck off, you Yank!

549
00:35:59,146 --> 00:36:00,981
I'm staying with
my uncle for the summer.

550
00:36:01,148 --> 00:36:03,025
Then I go back
to art school in Brussels.

551
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,736
Could I take you out
for coffee sometime?

552
00:36:05,902 --> 00:36:07,237
You mean like a date?

553
00:36:07,904 --> 00:36:09,364
Well, yeah.

554
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,245
Oh, the siren.

555
00:36:17,747 --> 00:36:20,291
Right. Right. Siren.

556
00:36:20,457 --> 00:36:24,086
Before I can go on a date I have to
collect five different colored tulips...

557
00:36:24,253 --> 00:36:27,798
...eat two herring and drink a beer
from a wooden shoe.

558
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:30,258
Well, that sounds doable.

559
00:36:35,930 --> 00:36:37,390
What is it?

560
00:36:40,267 --> 00:36:41,435
The accordion player?

561
00:36:48,942 --> 00:36:50,777
The Smelly Finger Dance.

562
00:36:57,783 --> 00:36:59,702
One cheek at a time.

563
00:37:00,995 --> 00:37:04,790
Hey, guys. I need a quick gigolo fix.
What do you say?

564
00:37:06,166 --> 00:37:09,252
I'm judging a sandcastle-building
competition this afternoon...

565
00:37:09,419 --> 00:37:11,004
...so I can't help you.

566
00:37:11,755 --> 00:37:14,465
The dog ate my penis.

567
00:37:17,426 --> 00:37:20,554
You don't have to walk me
any further. I just work over there.

568
00:37:20,721 --> 00:37:23,348
- I don't mind.
- I'm kind of embarrassed of my job.

569
00:37:23,515 --> 00:37:26,643
I'm kind of embarrassed of my job too.
What do you do?

570
00:37:27,519 --> 00:37:29,104
Bye, Deuce.

571
00:37:29,729 --> 00:37:34,108
Well, well, well. If it isn't
Deuce Not-So-Big-Below.

572
00:37:37,111 --> 00:37:38,571
It's Bigalow.

573
00:37:38,696 --> 00:37:40,823
What's your going rate, Douche?

574
00:37:40,948 --> 00:37:43,951
Well, I was getting $10.

575
00:37:45,953 --> 00:37:50,081
Okay, gigolo. Do you even know
when a woman is having an orgasm?

576
00:37:50,248 --> 00:37:52,167
Sure I know. It's when she says:

577
00:37:52,375 --> 00:37:56,295
"Please stop. It's okay. You tried.

578
00:37:57,505 --> 00:37:59,215
Now, get off me. "

579
00:38:03,218 --> 00:38:05,762
I bet he doesn't even know
how to give a Sneaky Castro.

580
00:38:05,971 --> 00:38:10,016
Well, that depends. If she wants it
regular sneaky or extra sneaky.

581
00:38:10,183 --> 00:38:12,852
There is no such thing
as an Extra Sneaky Castro.

582
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,147
Is there?

583
00:38:16,981 --> 00:38:18,607
It's when you stick it in their...

584
00:38:18,816 --> 00:38:22,903
It's pretty convenient, your friend
killing off all the competition.

585
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:26,239
I've got my eye on you, Small-Below.

586
00:38:26,406 --> 00:38:28,325
Small-Below.

587
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:34,580
<i>I'll be right down. </i>

588
00:38:40,127 --> 00:38:41,337
Okay.

589
00:38:42,713 --> 00:38:44,590
This is the woman
that went out with Heinz...

590
00:38:44,798 --> 00:38:46,758
...the night before
he was murdered.

591
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:53,097
Don't worry about it, Sherlock Ho.
I ain't gonna let you out of my sight.

592
00:38:56,517 --> 00:38:58,936
Hi, you must be Lily. I'm Deuce.

593
00:38:59,103 --> 00:39:01,230
Nice to meet you.

594
00:39:11,531 --> 00:39:13,241
Would you like some bread?

595
00:39:13,449 --> 00:39:15,368
Oh, I can't have bread.

596
00:39:15,576 --> 00:39:18,120
It's makes my
esophageal lining swell up...

597
00:39:18,287 --> 00:39:20,623
...and could block my throat-hole.

598
00:39:21,624 --> 00:39:23,542
- Excuse me for a second.
- Sure.

599
00:39:29,714 --> 00:39:32,050
Pardon me. I had to clear.

600
00:39:33,009 --> 00:39:34,469
Yeah.

601
00:39:35,678 --> 00:39:38,055
- So, what do you do?
- I just got fired.

602
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:40,975
- I'm sorry.
- I was a phone-sex operator.

603
00:39:42,685 --> 00:39:46,605
I only lasted a week.
They were jealous of me.

604
00:39:47,731 --> 00:39:50,483
I heard that Heinz Hummer
had a bit of a jealous streak.

605
00:39:50,650 --> 00:39:52,277
I bet you're glad he's dead.

606
00:39:52,485 --> 00:39:57,073
Heinz was the most
gentle man I ever knew.

607
00:39:57,281 --> 00:40:00,951
I miss him and his mangina.

608
00:40:02,786 --> 00:40:04,788
I can't take it anymore.

609
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:09,334
I'm sorry. I can see that
you really liked Heinz.

610
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:13,713
- Here, let me get that for you.
- Thanks.

611
00:40:20,177 --> 00:40:23,013
- Let's go.
- I think I'm gonna puke.

612
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:26,141
I started smoking again
when I lost my job.

613
00:40:26,350 --> 00:40:29,853
If I don't find another one pretty soon,
I'm gonna lose my house.

614
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:32,522
Well, we'll just have to find
you a new one.

615
00:40:33,064 --> 00:40:36,734
- Relax. Have some wine.
- Thanks.

616
00:40:49,329 --> 00:40:51,748
I don't normally drink red wine so...

617
00:40:53,166 --> 00:40:54,542
I have hiccups.

618
00:40:57,461 --> 00:41:00,464
- Gone down the wrong hole, I think.
- Check, please.

619
00:41:02,049 --> 00:41:05,260
Deuce, I can't thank you enough.

620
00:41:05,427 --> 00:41:08,847
It's good for you, it's good for them.
I'm just glad it worked out.

621
00:41:11,015 --> 00:41:14,310
- I better get to work.
- I'll be hearing from you.

622
00:41:14,477 --> 00:41:15,937
Okay.

623
00:41:18,064 --> 00:41:22,234
<i>The white zone is for loading
and unloading of vehicles only. </i>

624
00:41:22,401 --> 00:41:24,778
<i>There is no parking
in the white zone. </i>

625
00:41:24,903 --> 00:41:27,739
<i>Thanks, Deuce. I had fun last night. </i>

626
00:41:27,948 --> 00:41:29,115
<i>The white zone...</i>

627
00:41:30,367 --> 00:41:32,785
I am Rodrigo Bollas de Madera.

628
00:41:33,953 --> 00:41:37,873
I am here for my 12:30
ass-hair bleaching.

629
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:39,875
Okay. How blond do you wanna go?

630
00:41:41,418 --> 00:41:42,795
Gwyneth.

631
00:41:43,504 --> 00:41:44,713
Good choice.

632
00:41:55,807 --> 00:41:57,058
Oh, hey.

633
00:41:57,225 --> 00:42:01,228
I got a real Janeane Garofalo
situation back there, so go for it.

634
00:42:06,817 --> 00:42:09,319
So, Enzo...

635
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:11,821
...got any she-johns
lined up for tonight?

636
00:42:11,988 --> 00:42:15,199
Well, I did a Chili Rainbow
last night so I'm exhausted.

637
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:18,494
What about you, Assapopulus?

638
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:20,871
I've got the herpes so...

639
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:22,539
What are you gonna do?

640
00:42:24,374 --> 00:42:25,500
Liar!

641
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:28,378
- Mahmoud!
- What's your excuse?

642
00:42:28,587 --> 00:42:31,589
I just realized I'm gay.

643
00:42:33,466 --> 00:42:35,885
Any of you guys want a blowjob?

644
00:42:38,095 --> 00:42:39,513
I do.

645
00:42:40,848 --> 00:42:42,433
Well...

646
00:42:42,599 --> 00:42:46,812
Okay, then. I better go
put that penis in my mouth.

647
00:42:46,937 --> 00:42:49,147
You're all afraid
of the Man-whore Killer.

648
00:42:49,356 --> 00:42:50,732
- No. Come on.
- No, we're not.

649
00:42:50,857 --> 00:42:53,693
- Get down!
- I don't wanna die!

650
00:42:54,027 --> 00:42:56,821
You really should find
a better hiding place.

651
00:42:57,905 --> 00:42:59,448
Oh, you haven't heard.

652
00:43:00,241 --> 00:43:03,118
- Rodrigo's been killed.
- No.

653
00:43:03,327 --> 00:43:06,455
Oh, my God, why? He was just
having his ass hair bleached.

654
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:08,874
He got much more than that,
I can assure you.

655
00:43:12,293 --> 00:43:15,088
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm very happy that Scotland Yard... </i>

656
00:43:15,254 --> 00:43:19,175
<i>... has now joined the search
for the gay killer, Tiberius Jefferson. </i>

657
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:20,718
<i>Thank you very much. </i>

658
00:43:21,802 --> 00:43:24,972
So how about this next one?
Svetlana Revenko.

659
00:43:25,347 --> 00:43:27,766
The Russian women are
a little freaky down below.

660
00:43:27,891 --> 00:43:31,186
Hair start in the front,
don't end till it get to the back.

661
00:43:31,352 --> 00:43:33,313
So if you gotta give
a little mouth-to-south...

662
00:43:33,521 --> 00:43:35,231
...put a clothespin on your nose.

663
00:43:35,857 --> 00:43:37,275
I'll keep that in mind.

664
00:43:39,693 --> 00:43:41,487
Wish me luck.

665
00:43:41,612 --> 00:43:44,573
Gasov. You mind changing that
to the weather channel?

666
00:43:47,492 --> 00:43:49,119
It's gonna be cold tomorrow.

667
00:43:51,371 --> 00:43:53,706
I have been waiting for you,
Mr. Bigalow.

668
00:43:57,668 --> 00:44:01,297
Aren't you afraid to work with the
Man-whore Killer on the loose?

669
00:44:01,630 --> 00:44:02,798
What do you know about it?

670
00:44:02,965 --> 00:44:06,134
Apparently there's some maniac
who's killing them all.

671
00:44:06,259 --> 00:44:08,595
Some people say they deserve it.
What do you think?

672
00:44:08,762 --> 00:44:11,931
I think everything
happens for reason.

673
00:44:12,765 --> 00:44:15,268
You're probably wondering
why I'm wearing this veil.

674
00:44:15,518 --> 00:44:19,271
I wasn't, but if you
wanna talk about it, cool.

675
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:20,773
I grew up in Chernobyl.

676
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:22,107
Chernobyl.

677
00:44:23,108 --> 00:44:25,360
- What a pretty name.
- My mother...

678
00:44:25,527 --> 00:44:29,197
...she work in nuclear reactor
when she was pregnant with me.

679
00:44:29,656 --> 00:44:34,160
Instead of a nose, I was born
with an appendage on my face.

680
00:44:35,411 --> 00:44:37,830
A male appendage.

681
00:44:40,166 --> 00:44:41,458
No shit?

682
00:44:42,418 --> 00:44:46,463
I have always been a little
self-conscious about it.

683
00:44:46,588 --> 00:44:48,882
Well, you shouldn't. I mean...

684
00:44:49,007 --> 00:44:54,137
A lot of women would love
to have a guy's dick on their face.

685
00:44:54,262 --> 00:44:56,347
Yours is just permanent.

686
00:44:58,432 --> 00:44:59,975
You are sweet.

687
00:45:00,809 --> 00:45:03,353
And very handsome
for an American.

688
00:45:06,606 --> 00:45:08,066
I like you.

689
00:45:15,531 --> 00:45:18,576
I would love to hear
some Latin music.

690
00:45:18,701 --> 00:45:20,953
Well, I'll see if the penis knows any.

691
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:24,289
I mean the pianist.

692
00:45:24,957 --> 00:45:26,875
The guy playing the piano.

693
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:32,005
The band has started.
Aren't we lucky?

694
00:45:50,438 --> 00:45:52,190
Damn, no lipstick.

695
00:45:52,398 --> 00:45:55,359
- You smell nice. What is it?
- It's Old Nice.

696
00:45:56,402 --> 00:45:58,654
It's a knockoff of Old Spice.

697
00:45:58,821 --> 00:46:02,866
I like it, but I think
it makes me sneeze.

698
00:46:03,075 --> 00:46:04,993
What happens when you sneeze?

699
00:46:07,245 --> 00:46:09,289
Oh, Jesus, I'm sorry.

700
00:46:10,206 --> 00:46:13,626
Oh, good Lord.
Now is a good time to turn.

701
00:46:24,303 --> 00:46:25,679
Hi.

702
00:46:37,064 --> 00:46:39,191
How long are you going
to be staying in Holland?

703
00:46:39,358 --> 00:46:41,485
Only until I can prove
my friend T.J.'s innocent.

704
00:46:41,902 --> 00:46:43,904
Is there someone waiting
for you back home?

705
00:46:45,197 --> 00:46:46,615
It's kind of hard to explain.

706
00:46:47,908 --> 00:46:49,618
Would you like to meet her?

707
00:46:50,243 --> 00:46:51,870
She's here in Amsterdam?

708
00:46:52,829 --> 00:46:54,580
It's my wife.

709
00:46:56,415 --> 00:46:58,876
I got her right here in my duffle bag.

710
00:47:04,047 --> 00:47:06,717
Kate, this is my new friend, Eva.

711
00:47:08,051 --> 00:47:10,595
She passed away
a couple of years ago...

712
00:47:10,804 --> 00:47:12,847
...and this is all I have left
of her and I...

713
00:47:18,019 --> 00:47:19,979
Nice to meet you.

714
00:47:20,187 --> 00:47:25,150
She was very lucky to have
someone so devoted to her.

715
00:47:40,789 --> 00:47:42,958
Hey, can I see you
when you get off work?

716
00:47:43,083 --> 00:47:46,878
Oh, you know, I'd really love to,
but I'm going to be so tired.

717
00:47:47,003 --> 00:47:48,880
- Bye.
- Okay.

718
00:48:00,891 --> 00:48:02,810
Eva. Eva.

719
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:06,646
Did you just kiss me nine times
because you're OCD?

720
00:48:06,813 --> 00:48:09,357
No. It's because I like you.

721
00:48:11,192 --> 00:48:12,527
Excuse us, coming through.

722
00:48:16,030 --> 00:48:17,949
What are they doing
in there, anyway?

723
00:48:18,532 --> 00:48:20,242
They're making a movie.

724
00:48:20,367 --> 00:48:22,745
Cool. What kind of movie?

725
00:48:27,916 --> 00:48:30,251
- I better get to work.
- Okay.

726
00:48:30,502 --> 00:48:32,921
In there? You work in there?

727
00:48:33,796 --> 00:48:36,799
- Yeah. Well...
- Hi, Eva. Great work yesterday.

728
00:48:36,966 --> 00:48:39,051
- Thank you.
- Eva. Eva. Listen...

729
00:48:39,176 --> 00:48:42,513
...we really need you on the set.
All the guys are waiting.

730
00:48:42,721 --> 00:48:45,849
- All the guys?
- Yeah. I can't keep them waiting.

731
00:48:46,016 --> 00:48:47,225
Bye, Deuce.

732
00:48:48,185 --> 00:48:50,603
I'll put your name on the list.

733
00:49:05,993 --> 00:49:07,411
Hey, whoa, whoa.

734
00:49:07,619 --> 00:49:09,287
Back of the line, buddy.

735
00:49:09,496 --> 00:49:12,081
Trust me, she's worth the wait.

736
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:17,503
It's a closed set,
you can't come in.

737
00:49:17,712 --> 00:49:19,004
Like hell I can't.

738
00:49:20,422 --> 00:49:22,132
Get off her, you little freak!

739
00:49:30,265 --> 00:49:31,891
Eva, you don't have to do this.

740
00:49:34,602 --> 00:49:37,897
Hey, I agreed to one midget,
not two!

741
00:49:40,482 --> 00:49:41,984
Deuce?

742
00:49:42,860 --> 00:49:44,570
Eva, you don't have to do this.

743
00:49:44,987 --> 00:49:46,196
Do what?

744
00:49:47,072 --> 00:49:49,032
- This.
- What?

745
00:49:50,658 --> 00:49:52,118
This.

746
00:49:54,829 --> 00:49:56,205
You painted that?

747
00:49:56,956 --> 00:49:58,958
I'm a scenic artist.

748
00:49:59,125 --> 00:50:01,293
So that's what you do here.

749
00:50:04,379 --> 00:50:06,340
Hey, little friend.
I guess I owe you a big...

750
00:50:10,010 --> 00:50:12,637
Stoner Steve here! Who wants
to get high? Stoner Steve!

751
00:50:12,845 --> 00:50:14,972
- T.J., is that you?
- Quiet, you dumb prosti-dude.

752
00:50:15,098 --> 00:50:17,475
I've went out with every girl
on that list in Holland.

753
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:20,644
- Find the rest of those bitches.
- Those women live in other countries.

754
00:50:20,811 --> 00:50:24,898
Goddamn, white boy! Pack up that
snatch-pole and go find the real killer!

755
00:50:25,023 --> 00:50:27,567
Stoner Steve! Stoner Steve Café!

756
00:50:38,285 --> 00:50:39,286
Hi.

757
00:50:40,663 --> 00:50:41,705
Hi.

758
00:51:41,594 --> 00:51:43,011
Hey, look at that.

759
00:51:43,178 --> 00:51:44,638
Look at that, right there.

760
00:51:55,565 --> 00:51:56,899
Are you sure?

761
00:52:26,259 --> 00:52:27,511
T.J., there you are.

762
00:52:27,677 --> 00:52:29,804
The girl with the giant ears
heard Heinz talking...

763
00:52:30,013 --> 00:52:33,266
...about some photo in the man-whore
society. We gotta get in there.

764
00:52:33,433 --> 00:52:36,561
- Why aren't you in disguise?
- I'm in disguise.

765
00:52:37,186 --> 00:52:38,646
I'm in blackface.

766
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:41,357
- But you're black.
- Yeah, but I'm disguised...

767
00:52:41,565 --> 00:52:43,233
...as a different black guy.

768
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:45,319
- You look the same.
- What you trying to say?

769
00:52:45,527 --> 00:52:47,612
- We all look alike?
- No, that's not it.

770
00:52:47,779 --> 00:52:50,907
You're such a racist. I got half a mind
to stop helping you save me.

771
00:52:51,074 --> 00:52:52,867
Come on. Jeez, let's go.

772
00:52:59,248 --> 00:53:02,710
Excuse me. This is a private club.
Man-whores only.

773
00:53:02,793 --> 00:53:05,671
Hey, I'm a real good man-whore.
Just go ask your mama.

774
00:53:07,631 --> 00:53:10,216
Still. I'm going to have
to ask you to leave.

775
00:53:10,425 --> 00:53:12,969
That's what your mama said
after I bang her.

776
00:53:15,388 --> 00:53:16,681
Okay, that's it.

777
00:53:16,889 --> 00:53:18,265
Go, go, go!

778
00:53:23,395 --> 00:53:25,606
Hey, your mama is in here.

779
00:53:25,772 --> 00:53:27,482
It's okay. I know
what I'm talking about.

780
00:53:27,649 --> 00:53:31,069
If you're going to stick two in there,
you're gonna need a lot of lubricant.

781
00:53:31,444 --> 00:53:33,321
I know what I'm talking about, huh?

782
00:53:33,488 --> 00:53:35,073
Okay, I gotta go now, Ma.

783
00:54:02,348 --> 00:54:04,016
Hey, this thing is locked.

784
00:54:12,607 --> 00:54:15,693
Man! I only heard about this place.

785
00:54:15,902 --> 00:54:18,571
This is where
man-whoring all started.

786
00:54:20,072 --> 00:54:22,366
Check it out. You know who this is?

787
00:54:22,491 --> 00:54:24,826
He was the first guy
to keep from shooting his load...

788
00:54:24,952 --> 00:54:26,161
...by thinking about sports.

789
00:54:28,538 --> 00:54:31,666
This guy, here?
Baron Von Doggy Style.

790
00:54:31,833 --> 00:54:34,293
Led a pimping expedition
to the Arctic Circle.

791
00:54:34,460 --> 00:54:36,879
Froze to death
sixty-nining a moose.

792
00:54:37,088 --> 00:54:40,007
The only thing left of him
is this stick...

793
00:54:40,174 --> 00:54:43,177
...which he used
to bitch-slap Eskimos.

794
00:54:47,931 --> 00:54:51,142
Now, this brother here,
Kunta Kuntlicker.

795
00:54:51,643 --> 00:54:54,270
He's the Jackie Robinson
of ass-eating.

796
00:54:56,981 --> 00:54:58,441
Vladmir Suckmeov.

797
00:54:59,024 --> 00:55:01,527
The first man-ho in space.
They were studying...

798
00:55:01,735 --> 00:55:03,946
...the effects of zero gravity
on the reach-around.

799
00:55:04,112 --> 00:55:07,866
- Will you cut it out?
- I'm sorry. This is my Graceland.

800
00:55:10,285 --> 00:55:12,620
Hey. Wait a minute.
Hey, check this out.

801
00:55:14,163 --> 00:55:17,750
That's the blond lady with the
leopard coat. This must be the killer.

802
00:55:19,502 --> 00:55:22,046
So, what are you going to wear
to the Man-whore Awards?

803
00:55:22,254 --> 00:55:25,549
I thought I'd go with a tux and satin
chaps with my ass-plug cuff link...

804
00:55:26,925 --> 00:55:29,928
- You left the trophy case open again.
- Whoa, papa, that wasn't me.

805
00:55:30,095 --> 00:55:31,471
Deucey.

806
00:55:32,388 --> 00:55:34,891
- I gotta fart.
- You gotta what?

807
00:55:35,099 --> 00:55:37,476
- I gotta fart.
- Well, hold it.

808
00:55:39,687 --> 00:55:40,938
I hear something.

809
00:55:44,316 --> 00:55:47,360
I think the building is squeaking.

810
00:55:47,652 --> 00:55:49,195
Maybe it's a bird.

811
00:55:55,409 --> 00:55:56,911
You idiot!

812
00:56:00,414 --> 00:56:01,874
- Go.
- Bigalow!

813
00:56:02,750 --> 00:56:05,085
Security! Stop them!

814
00:56:07,045 --> 00:56:08,547
T.J.

815
00:56:21,141 --> 00:56:23,018
- Move the curtain!
- What the hell?

816
00:56:23,143 --> 00:56:24,686
Somebody smoked a he-bitch!

817
00:56:27,064 --> 00:56:29,524
- Enzo? He kill Enzo.
- No, no, I didn't do it.

818
00:56:29,733 --> 00:56:31,651
What is that?

819
00:56:32,694 --> 00:56:35,029
That is not a dick in my hand.

820
00:56:35,196 --> 00:56:39,075
Anybody got some antibacterial gel?
I got burnt dick on my hand.

821
00:56:46,707 --> 00:56:48,583
Eva. Eva.

822
00:56:48,708 --> 00:56:50,960
- I'm in the shower.
- T.J.'s been arrested.

823
00:56:51,086 --> 00:56:53,421
I can't hear you!
I'll be out in a minute!

824
00:56:53,504 --> 00:56:57,049
<i>In his gayest murder yet, the
homosexual Man-whore Killer... </i>

825
00:56:57,258 --> 00:56:59,760
<i>... murdered famed gigolo
Enzo Giarraputo. </i>

826
00:57:00,261 --> 00:57:04,431
<i>Our meteorologist Truus is sick today.
Filling in is Henk van de Berg. </i>

827
00:57:51,641 --> 00:57:54,352
What's the matter?
Why are you looking at me like that?

828
00:57:54,519 --> 00:57:55,978
Like what?

829
00:58:06,363 --> 00:58:09,199
I'll get that. I was a
Boy Scout for almost a week.

830
00:58:11,409 --> 00:58:13,119
So is your uncle home?

831
00:58:13,661 --> 00:58:16,539
No. We're completely alone.

832
00:58:17,748 --> 00:58:19,375
Would you like some cheese?

833
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:20,834
I'm lactose intolerant.

834
00:58:21,460 --> 00:58:23,337
Why are you so jumpy?

835
00:58:23,837 --> 00:58:25,547
Maybe I can help you relax.

836
00:58:30,051 --> 00:58:31,719
You're shaking.

837
00:58:33,263 --> 00:58:34,722
Maybe it's because I'm cold.

838
00:58:35,181 --> 00:58:36,766
I can fix that.

839
00:58:37,308 --> 00:58:39,101
Why don't you pour us a drink.

840
00:58:43,939 --> 00:58:47,359
So I guess we're all alone, huh?

841
00:58:49,027 --> 00:58:50,445
Yes.

842
00:58:51,863 --> 00:58:54,073
Deuce. You're scaring me.

843
00:58:54,741 --> 00:58:55,950
Eva.

844
00:58:58,327 --> 00:59:03,040
Listen, everything I'm about to do
is because I really care for you.

845
00:59:03,665 --> 00:59:04,958
Oh, Deuce.

846
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:06,752
Now, I don't know why...

847
00:59:08,461 --> 00:59:12,340
I don't know why you've done this, but
I'm gonna give you everything I've got.

848
00:59:38,864 --> 00:59:40,199
Deuce?

849
00:59:49,416 --> 00:59:51,251
- Don't go in there. Stop!
- Gaspar. Gaspar.

850
00:59:51,376 --> 00:59:54,629
I know who the killer is.
I know who the killer is.

851
01:00:01,093 --> 01:00:02,302
I know who the killer is.

852
01:00:02,428 --> 01:00:05,389
I knew sooner or later
someone would figure it out.

853
01:00:10,477 --> 01:00:12,687
I'm sorry I have to be
the one to tell you.

854
01:00:17,316 --> 01:00:18,818
It's Eva.

855
01:00:20,152 --> 01:00:21,779
It's Eva?

856
01:00:23,572 --> 01:00:25,574
You mean my niece Eva?

857
01:00:25,782 --> 01:00:27,701
I know it sounds crazy...

858
01:00:27,868 --> 01:00:30,704
...but I found the lipstick.
The same lipstick the killer used.

859
01:00:30,870 --> 01:00:34,665
Shimmer Lavender Love number 66,
at your house.

860
01:00:34,832 --> 01:00:38,544
And you found it in the pocket
of a trench coat hanging in the closet?

861
01:00:38,753 --> 01:00:42,506
Exactly. Plus, I heard her whistling the
same song I heard the killer whistle.

862
01:00:42,673 --> 01:00:44,007
Like:

863
01:00:50,805 --> 01:00:53,266
Now, you tell me.
Why would anyone but the killer...

864
01:00:53,474 --> 01:00:56,686
...be whistling that specific song?
The odds would be astronomical.

865
01:00:56,852 --> 01:00:58,562
Maybe the song
got stuck in her head...

866
01:00:58,729 --> 01:01:00,981
...because she overheard
the real killer whistling it.

867
01:01:01,190 --> 01:01:03,150
And maybe the real killer
is someone...

868
01:01:04,151 --> 01:01:07,571
...very near and dear to her,
though she doesn't realize.

869
01:01:08,947 --> 01:01:12,659
Sure. Or maybe the Hamburglar did it
and escaped with the Great Pumpkin.

870
01:01:13,284 --> 01:01:16,412
Look, I understand this must be
very difficult for you...

871
01:01:16,579 --> 01:01:19,123
...to be out-thunk
by a civilian like myself.

872
01:01:19,290 --> 01:01:21,250
But we have to put
our egos aside right now...

873
01:01:21,375 --> 01:01:22,793
...and do what's best for Eva.

874
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:24,920
She's clearly ill
and she needs our help.

875
01:01:25,128 --> 01:01:26,505
You're absolutely right.

876
01:01:26,671 --> 01:01:29,883
You know, the only thing
I can't think of is motive.

877
01:01:30,008 --> 01:01:32,135
I mean, what could she
have against man-whores?

878
01:01:32,343 --> 01:01:36,722
Maybe because they represent
a decline of this once glorious city...

879
01:01:36,847 --> 01:01:39,809
...which has become a new Sodom
and Gomorrah for rich college kids...

880
01:01:39,975 --> 01:01:42,978
...to smoke hash, to fornicate
with Venezuelan hookers...

881
01:01:43,103 --> 01:01:46,940
...or to defecate on our
historic cobblestone streets.

882
01:01:47,149 --> 01:01:49,567
They don't defecate on the streets.

883
01:01:54,447 --> 01:01:57,700
Well, how do you know he's a tourist?
I mean, he could be a local.

884
01:02:02,871 --> 01:02:04,206
Where is Eva now?

885
01:02:05,374 --> 01:02:07,084
She's at your house.

886
01:02:07,209 --> 01:02:08,793
Good.

887
01:02:15,842 --> 01:02:17,927
Do you really think you need
all those weapons?

888
01:02:18,052 --> 01:02:20,054
She doesn't seem that dangerous.

889
01:02:20,262 --> 01:02:23,891
- You're not gonna hurt her, are you?
- You can never be too careful.

890
01:02:25,767 --> 01:02:29,437
- That poor guy.
- What a dipshit.

891
01:02:30,188 --> 01:02:31,856
<i>Tonight, the sexually-inadequate men

- His mother. </i>

898

She's the woman that made me
start into prostitution...

899
01:02:54,085 --> 01:02:57,129
...made me go into prostitution.
I wanted to become a doctor, but...

900
01:02:57,338 --> 01:02:59,131
Uncle, you home?

904
01:03:09,599 --> 01:03:13,895
<i>Thank you very much. Can I just say,
ladies, gentlemen, man-whores... </i>

905
01:03:14,103 --> 01:03:18,691
<i>... a night where we celebrate guys
who can get wood no matter what. </i>

906
01:03:18,899 --> 01:03:20,651
<i>Do you know,

907
01:03:20,859 --> 01:03:23,070
- Oh, my God.
- Yes.

908
01:03:25,656 --> 01:03:28,867
- I'm going to kill them all.
- But why?

909
01:03:29,075 --> 01:03:31,995
Don't you see what's happening
to our country?

910
01:03:36,499 --> 01:03:38,751
But it's murder.

911
01:03:40,336 --> 01:03:44,840
During the final number, when these
man-whores are gathered on-stage...

912
01:03:44,965 --> 01:03:47,259
...I push this little button and:

913
01:03:48,468 --> 01:03:50,553
Bye-bye, gigolos.

914
01:03:50,678 --> 01:03:55,141
Shouldn't be that hard to pin the crime
on your good friend Deuce Bigalow.

915
01:03:55,308 --> 01:03:56,475
I won't let you!

916
01:03:59,228 --> 01:04:01,188
If you wanna stop me...

917
01:04:03,732 --> 01:04:06,943
...it's as simple as touching
this doorknob.

918
01:04:12,490 --> 01:04:15,326
- Where's Eva?
- Eva's gone to the Man-whore Awards.

919
01:04:15,493 --> 01:04:17,912
- I'm going there too.
- I'm coming with you.

920
01:04:18,537 --> 01:04:21,790
Yes. Yes, you should be there too.

921
01:04:35,553 --> 01:04:36,762
Now let me give you all
the lowdown on T.J.

922
01:04:36,804 --> 01:04:38,014
Now let me give you all
the lowdown on T.J.

923
01:04:38,180 --> 01:04:43,185
In Thailand, I got a job in a carnival
sideshow, eating broken glass.

924
01:04:43,352 --> 01:04:46,897
We did six shows a day.
That's a lot of broken glass.

925
01:04:47,105 --> 01:04:50,275
And it's all collected in the lining
of my anus.

926
01:04:50,900 --> 01:04:54,612
My ass is like one big,
nasty cheese grater.

927
01:04:56,531 --> 01:04:59,366
Here to perform his signature move,
the Chili Rainbow...

928
01:04:59,533 --> 01:05:03,871
...would you please welcome
Assapopulus Borealis.

929
01:05:26,725 --> 01:05:28,101
Deuce!

930
01:05:28,268 --> 01:05:29,853
Deuce! Right here!

931
01:05:30,020 --> 01:05:32,230
- Hey, Eva's right behind us.
- Deuce, stop!

932
01:05:34,732 --> 01:05:36,609
What are you doing?
She's right back there.

933
01:05:37,818 --> 01:05:39,695
- He's the killer!
- What?

934
01:05:39,904 --> 01:05:41,238
You're with the killer!

935
01:05:41,405 --> 01:05:43,782
- I'm with the dealer?
- He's the Man-whore Killer!

936
01:05:43,991 --> 01:05:45,742
Eighteen-wheeler?

937
01:05:46,576 --> 01:05:47,911
My uncle is the killer!

938
01:05:48,662 --> 01:05:51,456
Oh! I'm with the... You're the k...

939
01:05:51,623 --> 01:05:54,917
She says that I am the killer,
you stupido.

940
01:06:00,422 --> 01:06:02,633
But why? What did man-whores
ever do to you?

941
01:06:02,758 --> 01:06:04,426
What did they do to me?

942
01:06:05,761 --> 01:06:09,055
All my life I dreamed
of being one thing: A gigolo.

943
01:06:09,222 --> 01:06:11,474
Yes, me. Gaspar Voorsboch.

944
01:06:12,767 --> 01:06:16,020
I'll never forget that day. Never.

945
01:06:16,229 --> 01:06:18,856
<i>It was my first semester
at Man-whore University. </i>

946
01:06:19,023 --> 01:06:20,316
Now, today, class...

947
01:06:20,524 --> 01:06:24,987
...we shall learn how to give a lady
a proper Portuguese Breakfast.

948
01:06:25,153 --> 01:06:27,531
You take an egg and you crack it.

949
01:06:28,031 --> 01:06:29,991
You mix them up.

950
01:06:30,158 --> 01:06:32,994
Now, this is a good chance
to sweet-talk the client.

951
01:06:33,369 --> 01:06:35,538
- And?
- And we pour that in there.

952
01:06:35,663 --> 01:06:39,166
- Beautiful. Very nice, now. And...
- And don't forget the Canadian bacon.

953
01:06:39,375 --> 01:06:40,918
Canadian bacon.
I was getting to that.

954
01:06:41,126 --> 01:06:43,295
- What are you doing?
- It's a penis enlarger.

955
01:06:43,462 --> 01:06:45,505
Just a few pumps
and it gets your thing bigger.

956
01:06:45,672 --> 01:06:47,591
You mind if I give myself
a few pumps?

957
01:06:47,716 --> 01:06:49,009
Go nuts.

958
01:06:49,134 --> 01:06:51,261
There we go. So there you have it.

959
01:06:51,427 --> 01:06:54,680
Tell me. How was your
Portuguese Breakfast?

960
01:06:54,847 --> 01:06:56,307
Delicious.

961
01:06:56,474 --> 01:06:58,601
- Elsa?
- Gaspar?

962
01:07:05,399 --> 01:07:07,109
They knew she was my fiancée.

963
01:07:07,234 --> 01:07:09,611
And tonight I will get my revenge.

964
01:07:16,325 --> 01:07:17,785
Leave it!

965
01:07:28,795 --> 01:07:31,714
I'm from Canada and I'm wasted!

966
01:07:33,841 --> 01:07:35,051
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

967
01:07:35,259 --> 01:07:37,136
- Are you okay?
- Stop! Stop!

968
01:07:37,345 --> 01:07:38,888
Police business.

969
01:07:39,472 --> 01:07:40,764
Come on, we gotta stop him.

970
01:07:41,974 --> 01:07:44,351
Stop! Stop! Man-whore business.

971
01:07:44,476 --> 01:07:47,020
Before we present the award for
Man-whore of the Year...

972
01:07:47,229 --> 01:07:51,149
...let's take a moment to honor those
gigolos who have recently passed.

973
01:08:09,457 --> 01:08:12,210
Hey, Daddy. I was looking in your
underwear drawer and I found...

974
01:08:12,418 --> 01:08:13,920
...this bracelet.

975
01:08:14,879 --> 01:08:17,840
Holy mother of God.
That's not a bracelet, boy.

976
01:08:18,049 --> 01:08:21,635
That is a device that your daddy
has to wear on his he...

977
01:08:21,969 --> 01:08:23,095
His he...

978
01:08:23,345 --> 01:08:25,389
His he...

979
01:08:26,681 --> 01:08:28,850
Happy birthday, son,
you got a bracelet.

980
01:08:29,059 --> 01:08:30,268
Great.

981
01:08:31,978 --> 01:08:33,146
Let's go. Come on.

982
01:08:33,271 --> 01:08:35,064
Now the award you've all
been waiting for:

983
01:08:35,231 --> 01:08:36,649
The Man-whore of the Year.

984
01:08:36,857 --> 01:08:39,485
Listen. Go get help. I'll get
all the gigolos off the stage.

985
01:08:39,693 --> 01:08:41,528
Okay. Good luck.

986
01:08:42,154 --> 01:08:43,363
Excuse me.

987
01:08:43,572 --> 01:08:45,991
You have to get off the stage
now or you'll all be killed!

988
01:08:46,158 --> 01:08:48,868
Get the hell out of here, Douche,
before I have you thrown out.

989
01:08:48,952 --> 01:08:51,538
- There's a bomb on the stage!
- You idiot.

990
01:08:51,704 --> 01:08:53,373
You're all gonna die!

991
01:08:54,332 --> 01:08:56,417
I'm the Man-whore Killer.
This is a bomb!

992
01:08:56,584 --> 01:08:59,795
Everybody out!
Everybody get out!

993
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:01,630
You gotta get out of here!

994
01:09:06,593 --> 01:09:09,471
You'll die with the rest
of them, Bigalow.

995
01:09:11,723 --> 01:09:14,976
Those gigolos robbed me
of my manhood.

996
01:09:15,143 --> 01:09:19,188
I was never able to satisfy a woman.
I'll see to it that they won't either.

997
01:09:24,109 --> 01:09:28,238
You don't have to kill anyone, Gaspar.
Because you can please a woman.

998
01:09:29,572 --> 01:09:31,741
<i>Those gigolos don't know
what they're talking about. </i>

999
01:09:31,950 --> 01:09:33,826
Is he talking about us?

1000
01:09:37,830 --> 01:09:39,457
Do you really think
all a woman wants...

1001
01:09:39,665 --> 01:09:41,583
...is some guy to give her
a Mud Pretzel...

1002
01:09:41,709 --> 01:09:44,753
...or Turkish Snow Cone
or an Irish Facial?

1003
01:09:45,962 --> 01:09:48,632
- Yes, they do, liar.
- No, they don't.

1004
01:09:49,507 --> 01:09:53,177
A woman wants a guy who'll ask her
about her day and really listen to her.

1005
01:09:53,386 --> 01:09:55,263
- Or at least pretend to.
- Yes.

1006
01:09:55,638 --> 01:09:57,056
What?

1007
01:09:57,265 --> 01:09:58,891
When she's hurting...

1008
01:09:59,058 --> 01:10:00,684
...ask her how she feels.

1009
01:10:01,894 --> 01:10:04,104
<i>- Cry with her.
- Yeah!</i>

1010
01:10:04,229 --> 01:10:06,106
These gigolos are just
ripping women off!

1011
01:10:07,607 --> 01:10:10,902
I've never had any complaint
from any of those freaks!

1012
01:10:13,279 --> 01:10:14,947
I faked it.

1013
01:10:16,866 --> 01:10:19,243
A woman doesn't care
if you wear a Rolex watch...

1014
01:10:19,452 --> 01:10:21,787
...or have a gigantic schlong
like Heinz Hummer.

1015
01:10:22,830 --> 01:10:24,540
This guy knows his shit.

1016
01:10:27,876 --> 01:10:29,377
What are you doing?

1017
01:10:30,712 --> 01:10:32,547
Anyone else?

1018
01:10:37,718 --> 01:10:41,096
If you let a woman know you care,
maybe she'll give you an Irish Facial.

1019
01:10:50,855 --> 01:10:53,650
We will die together, man-whore.

1020
01:10:55,318 --> 01:10:58,320
- You don't have to do this.
- They ruined my life.

1021
01:10:58,446 --> 01:11:01,573
- Give me the detonator.
- No.

1022
01:11:01,740 --> 01:11:03,450
My penis exploded.

1023
01:11:04,826 --> 01:11:06,995
Okay, that's a tough one.
I'll give you that.

1024
01:11:08,622 --> 01:11:12,584
But having a penis
is way overrated. Trust me.

1025
01:11:14,252 --> 01:11:16,420
No. No.

1026
01:11:16,546 --> 01:11:18,005
Gaspar!

1027
01:11:26,513 --> 01:11:28,139
Are you okay?

1028
01:11:30,225 --> 01:11:32,185
We did it.

1029
01:11:37,815 --> 01:11:39,984
That's the grossest thing
I've ever seen.

1030
01:11:40,067 --> 01:11:42,069
And I've seen some
pretty gross things.

1031
01:11:42,236 --> 01:11:42,945
- In the car.
- Put your head down.

1032
01:11:42,945 --> 01:11:43,612
- In the car.
- Put your head down.

1033
01:11:43,821 --> 01:11:45,656
I'll be seeing you again, man-whore.

1034
01:11:46,823 --> 01:11:50,410
Deuce, you saved
the Man-whore Society.

1035
01:11:51,119 --> 01:11:52,787
The Golden Boner belongs to you.

1036
01:11:52,996 --> 01:11:55,206
Thanks. I'm... That's very...

1037
01:11:56,541 --> 01:11:58,167
This belongs to you too.

1038
01:11:59,710 --> 01:12:01,503
Hang it to the left.

1039
01:12:02,004 --> 01:12:03,547
You gonna eat that?

1040
01:12:03,672 --> 01:12:05,966
- Knock yourself out.
- Thank you.

1041
01:12:08,969 --> 01:12:12,263
So I guess this means
you're a real gigolo now.

1042
01:12:12,388 --> 01:12:14,098
I don't want you
to treat me differently.

1043
01:12:14,223 --> 01:12:16,184
How much would you
charge me for a kiss?

1044
01:12:16,559 --> 01:12:18,561
Well, the first one's always free.

1045
01:12:22,856 --> 01:12:25,275
- Deuce!
- What?

1046
01:12:25,859 --> 01:12:27,486
Oh, no. No, it's...

1047
01:12:27,611 --> 01:12:29,195
It's just this.

1048
01:12:50,507 --> 01:12:52,342
Deucey!

1049
01:12:52,467 --> 01:12:54,010
Thank you, Jesus.

1050
01:12:54,886 --> 01:12:56,345
Did anybody hurt you in there?

1051
01:12:57,471 --> 01:13:00,641
Oh, you asking if I got ass-punked.
Is that what's happening right now?

1052
01:13:00,849 --> 01:13:05,270
- Not if you don't wanna talk about it.
- Well, turns out I'm not that attractive.

1053
01:13:05,437 --> 01:13:07,063
Well, you've been cleared
of murder...

1054
01:13:07,230 --> 01:13:09,607
...but people still think you're gay.
- Hey, hey, hey.

1055
01:13:09,774 --> 01:13:11,776
Don't tell nobody I'm not gay.
Look at it:

1056
01:13:11,943 --> 01:13:14,695
T.J., the gay man's pimp.

1057
01:13:14,821 --> 01:13:17,531
I mean, I'm gonna corner the market.
Check out my new bitches.

1058
01:13:17,698 --> 01:13:19,700
- Hello, darling.
- Hi, sweetie.

1059
01:13:19,825 --> 01:13:21,327
Love you.

1060
01:13:23,078 --> 01:13:24,705
Let's get chicken and waffles.
My treat.

1061
01:13:24,871 --> 01:13:28,041
So the first thing a brother wants
out of prison is chicken and waffles?

1062
01:13:28,208 --> 01:13:30,418
- Oh, come on.
- Get your she-cocks back to work.

1063
01:13:31,418 --> 01:13:41,418
