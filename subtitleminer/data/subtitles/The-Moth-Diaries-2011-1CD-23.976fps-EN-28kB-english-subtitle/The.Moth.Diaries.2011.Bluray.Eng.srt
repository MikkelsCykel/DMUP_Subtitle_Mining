166
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:54,556
- Okay.

167
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:56,016
I got to grab my books
for English...

168
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:57,225
Check out
the cute new teacher.

169
00:07:57,226 --> 00:07:58,310
I'll see you at quiet hour?

170
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:01,646
- I said I would
spend it with Dora.

171
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:04,232
- It's our first day back.

172
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:05,233
- Okay.

173
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:07,319
I can see her another time.

174
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,653
- Okay, great.

175
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:14,993
- Hi.

176
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:16,244
- Hi.

177
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:18,830
- I'm Ernessa... Bloch.

178
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:22,292
- Yeah, I saw you last night.

179
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:24,294
How are you finding
everything?

180
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:26,546
It's a little strange.

181
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:27,589
- It must be hard,

182
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,299
with everyone already
knowing each other.

183
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,967
- What's that?

184
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:33,136
- It's a friendship necklace.

185
00:08:33,137 --> 00:08:35,096
My friend Rebecca
gave it to me.

186
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:40,477
- It's really pretty.

187
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:46,775
Would you show me around?

188
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:49,694
I don't really know
where I'm supposed to be.

189
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:51,696
- Yeah.

190
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:53,031
Yeah, come with me.

191
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:55,367
- In all of the classic Gothic
horror stories,

192
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:57,911
we see expressed
some kind of anxiety

193
00:08:57,912 --> 00:08:59,663
about the modern world.

194
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:01,206
In Bram Stoker's Dracula,

195
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:04,584
some critics see an anxiety
about female power,

196
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:07,712
female sexuality,

197
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:10,340
a fear that
the pure Victorian maiden

198
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:12,509
would be transformed
into a ravenous beast.

199
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,636
The story is a shape-shifter,

200
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:17,430
just like the vampire itself.

201
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:19,558
You find it in different forms
in almost all cultures,

202
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,393
but there are three things
you find

203
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:23,228
in every vampire story:

204
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:27,691
sex, blood, and death.

205
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:35,657
Becca?

206
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:37,951
Just want you to know,
I'm a great admirer

207
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:39,744
of your father's work.

208
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:41,037
I'm going to be running
a poetry workshop

209
00:09:41,038 --> 00:09:42,038
later this term.

210
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:43,039
I was hoping you'd take part.

211
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,916
- Yeah.

212
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:46,835
- Okay, good.

213
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:49,504
- Um, thank you.

214
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:01,349
Are you lost?

215
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,395
- No.

216
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:07,689
This is one of my favorite
places here.

217
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:09,357
- The passageway?

218
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:11,526
It's so dark; I always just run
straight through.

219
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:14,237
- I like looking out
the windows.

220
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:16,781
- I'm actually going to see
Miss Norris.

221
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:18,575
She teaches Greek.

222
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:19,909
I have lessons with her
on my own

223
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:22,370
because no one else
wants to do it.

224
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:25,206
- I used to study Greek
and Latin.

225
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:28,710
I was very serious,
even though I was a girl.

226
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:34,049
Then other things intervened.

227
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:39,512
- Okay, well, um...

228
00:10:39,513 --> 00:10:42,390

- So how's Mr. Davies' class?

246
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:54,921
- She has a huge crush on him.

247
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:57,465
And he's just lapping it up.

248
00:11:57,466 --> 00:11:58,717
It's sickening.

249

- Jealous much?

250
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,763
He's actually really cool.

00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:05,557
Hey, why don't you switch?

252
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,475
- No, I like the Romantic poets.

253
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:10,645
- I thought you hated poetry.

254
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:12,355
- No, I just never read
the right stuff.

255
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:14,691
You know, Ernessa says

00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:16,526
poetry is the purest
of all the arts.

257

- Ernessa?

258
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:19,946
- She's incredibly smart.

259
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:24,284
She's gonna help me
with my German.

260
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:27,912
She speaks it perfectly.

261

What are you reading?

Sit down.

pacing back and forth
under our window,

274

and she was in her bare feet.

00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:57,919
It was kind of weird
and creepy.

276

So what?

it's kind of strange?

I didn't know
you played the piano.

We're just talking

Now, with Carmilla,

308
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:39,414
we are looking at
one of the originators

309
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:40,957
of the Gothic tale,

310
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:43,376
20 years before Bram Stoker
wrote Dracula,

311
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:45,294
and I think it's fair to say,

312
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:46,963
it influenced him greatly.

313
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:49,632
All right, let's talk about
the character of Carmilla.

314
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:51,926
A mysterious stranger
comes from the West

315
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:54,595
and begins to take over
the narrator, Laura.

316
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:56,389
- "Sometimes
with gloating eyes,

"she drew me to her,

"traveled along
my cheeks in kisses,

almost in sobs,

You shall be mine.

You and I are one forever.'"

- What are you reading?
- CarmiIIa.

326
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,451
It's for Mr. Davies' class.

327

- Hey.

00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:24,792
- You know,
it's Gothic fiction.

330
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:26,127
- You're burning red.

331
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:28,296
How do you stand such hot water
on your skin?

332
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:30,339
- We always take hot baths
before bedtime.

333
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,050
It's relaxing.

334
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:35,595
- So I've brought us
a list of verbs to conjugate.

335
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:39,432
Let's start with baden,
to bathe.

336
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:40,475
- Baden.

337
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:41,476
- Mm-hmm.

338
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:45,480
Beginnen.

339
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,739
- Beginnen.

340
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,658
I'll show you how far I got.

341
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:02,914
- "The vampire is prone
to be fascinated

342
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:05,333
"by particular persons.

343
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:08,544
"With an engrossing vehemence
resembling the passion of love,

344
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:13,966
"it will never desist until
it has satiated its passion

345
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:17,678
and drained the very life
of its coveted victim."

346
00:18:29,024 --> 00:18:30,066
- Hello.

347
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:31,943
- Do you have a minute?
- Of course.

348
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:35,863
Here you go.

349
00:18:35,864 --> 00:18:38,032
Please.

350
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:42,411
- Um, it's about Carmilla.
- Okay.

351
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:44,205
- If she's in love with Laura,

352
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:45,915
then why does she want
to destroy her?

353
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,583
- Well, I don't know
that she wants to destroy her.

354
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:49,001
She wants to control her.

355
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:51,295
The vampire's
a very lonely figure.

356
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:53,464
Carmilla wants a companion
in her existence.

357
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:55,967
She wants someone
to be all hers, forever.

358
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:59,637
- But why does Laura want
to be friends with someone

359
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:01,931
who's so obviously evil?

360
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:04,058
- I suppose she's been
hypnotized in some way.

361
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:06,727
Remember, the vampire needs
the consent of the victim.

362
00:19:06,728 --> 00:19:09,397
- The vampire needs
the victim's consent?

363
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:11,149
- Yes-
well, in a way.

364
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,859
Remember, in Dracula,
he can only enter

365
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,694
if the victim
leaves the window open.

366
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:17,321
- It's Lucy's fault
for being such a weak person.

367
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:19,657
- Lucy?
- No, I mean Laura.

368
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:21,033
It's Laura's fault.

369
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:23,286
- Mm, in a way.

370
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:24,328
- Thank you.

371
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:25,413
It's been a big help.

372
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:32,837
Hey, Lu, do you have
the shoe polish?

373
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:34,088
Did you get new shoes?

374
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:36,924
I don't think those are allowed,
are they?

375
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:38,259
- These are Ernessa's.

376
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,969
- And why are you cleaning them?

377
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:41,721
- She doesn't know how.

378
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:43,514
She's never had to polish
her own shoes.

379
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:45,808
- It's really not that hard.

380
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:48,019
I'm sure she could do it
if she tried.

381
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:01,032
She never eats.
Have you noticed?

382
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:02,200
- What?

383
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:04,160
- Ernessa, she never eats
anything, ever.

384
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:05,453
- Maybe she's anorexic.

385
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:07,163
- Remember Annie Patterson
last year?

386
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:09,665
Her face looked like a skull,
and she still wouldn't eat.

387
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:11,834
- I just don't think
that'll ever be my problem.

388
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:13,294
- When you lose
that much weight,

389
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:14,879
your body can't even
keep itself warm,

390
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,672
and you begin to grow fuzz
all over your arms.

391
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:18,841
You can see it when they stand
against the light.

392
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:20,843
They call it "the glow."
Does Ernessa glow?

393
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:23,137
- No, and I don't think
she's starving herself.

394
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:25,306
Look at her.
She has a perfect body.

395
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:26,724
But if you think
she has anorexia,

396
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:28,768
you could just go up to her
and feel her arms.

397
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:31,187
- This is really fucking stupid.

398
00:20:33,857 --> 00:20:36,150
- Sorry.
- Whoa.

399
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:37,443
- She's too sensitive.

400
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:38,945
- What a way to start a morning.

401
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:48,788
Do you think Ernessa's
hooking up with someone

402
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:49,872
at Langley College?

403
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:51,040
- A boy?
No way.

404
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:52,500
- She's slipping out at night.

405
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:53,542
- What do you mean?

406
00:20:53,543 --> 00:20:55,002
- I heard her door open
last night.

407
00:20:55,003 --> 00:20:56,170
And she didn't come back in,

408
00:20:56,171 --> 00:20:58,005
at least not until after
I fell asleep.

409
00:20:58,006 --> 00:20:59,006
- Really?

410
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,091
- It's happened before too.

411
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:01,259
- Weirdo.

412
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,677
Maybe she goes out to score.

413
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:04,428
- In the middle of the night,
go into town?

414
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:05,805
- Let's follow her.

415
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:07,890
See where she goes,
what she gets up to.

416
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:10,935
- Can you see anything?

417
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:12,311
- I don't know.

418
00:21:12,312 --> 00:21:13,354
- It's fucking freezing.

419
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:16,190
What does Ernessa do out here?

420
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:17,817
- She watches us sleep.

421
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:30,413
Hey, you know when you see
the school from here,

422
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:32,164
you can totally imagine
what it looked like

423
00:21:32,165 --> 00:21:33,624
back when it was a hotel.

424
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:36,335
Guests drinking tea
on the lawn.

425
00:21:36,336 --> 00:21:37,670
- When I see the school
from here,

426
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:39,171
I think about how easy
it would be

427
00:21:39,172 --> 00:21:42,008
to just walk out.

428
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:44,677
- Well, I don't see Ernessa,
and it's cold.

429
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:46,012
Come on, let's go,

430
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:49,223
before the caretaker
creeps on us.

431
00:21:49,224 --> 00:21:50,558
- Dora, wait up.

432
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:04,113
- What are you doing?
- Come on.

433
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:12,413
- Deanndra,
comment for short skirt.

434
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:15,207
Charlotte, third comment
for messy hair.

435
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:19,253
Detention.

436
00:22:19,254 --> 00:22:22,006
Rebecca,
comment for dirty shoes.

437
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:24,800
And Mrs. Rood needs to see you
in her study now.

438
00:22:24,801 --> 00:22:27,053
- How can she give
wardrobe advice?

439
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:28,387
It's like we're in,
like, duty.

440
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:42,360
- When I was a little girl,

441
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:43,736
the farmers said that
a nosebleed

442
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:46,530
was a sign of good luck.

443
00:22:49,284 --> 00:22:50,618
You really shouldn't be sad

444
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:52,953
about these
cheap, sentimental things.

445
00:22:52,954 --> 00:22:55,831
I feel like sweeping them all
into a pile on the floor.

446
00:22:55,832 --> 00:22:57,041
- That's cruel.

447
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:58,667
Mrs. Rood lost her husband.

448
00:22:58,668 --> 00:23:00,795
She needs these things
to go on living.

449
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:05,049
- I don't need things
to remember my father.

450
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,509
- Neither do l.

451
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:37,289
Before Ernessa came here,
I was getting better.

452
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:38,707
I was happy.

453
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:46,006
Now all the darkness
has come flooding back.

454
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:50,719
It's like she's invading
my mind.

455
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,264
Even when I'm alone,
I can't escape her.

456
00:23:57,352 --> 00:24:01,605
There's this disgusting smell
that comes from her room:

457
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:04,442
sickly sweet but rotten.

458
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:07,194
Why doesn't anyone else
notice it?

459
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:12,992
Lucy?

460
00:24:16,204 --> 00:24:18,038
I haven't seen you all day.
Where have you been?

461
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:21,500
- I was busy.

462
00:24:21,501 --> 00:24:22,960
Why did you complain
to Mrs. Rood

463
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:24,211
about Ernessa's room?

464
00:24:24,212 --> 00:24:25,713
- Lucy, it's right across
the hall from me,

465
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:27,047
and it smells really bad.

466
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:29,175
- I thought you would be more
sensitive, considering.

467
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:30,384
- Considering what?

468
00:24:30,385 --> 00:24:32,720
- Her dad killed himself.

469
00:24:36,183 --> 00:24:37,516
- I didn't know.

470
00:24:37,517 --> 00:24:39,727
- I thought you, of all people,
would understand.

471
00:24:53,116 --> 00:24:54,450
- November 9th.

472
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:56,619
His last day on Earth.

473
00:25:01,124 --> 00:25:02,458
Lucy didn't remember.

474
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:03,959
She never said anything.

475
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:07,129
We spent it together
last year.

476
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:16,555
- What's your favorite memory
of your father?

477
00:25:16,556 --> 00:25:17,890
Let's think about that.

478
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:24,271
- If I had to pick one moment,

479
00:25:24,272 --> 00:25:27,608
it would be the night we saw
the Luna moth.

480
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:33,948
- Look.

481
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:35,950
There.

482
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:37,201
You see it?

483
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:41,372
I've never seen a moth
like that before.

484
00:25:52,133 --> 00:25:55,177
- The Luna moth was the most
beautiful thing I've ever seen.

485
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:01,934
Why weren't those things
enough for him?

486
00:26:05,146 --> 00:26:09,817
"A person may become a vampyre
if he dies unseen."

487
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:13,696
My father
wanted to die unseen,

488
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:16,824
like an animal who wants
to curl up and die alone.

489
00:26:21,496 --> 00:26:23,497
- Don't feel bad
about your father.

490
00:26:23,498 --> 00:26:27,668
Some of the greatest artists
went mad or committed suicide.

491
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:33,007
Some people find great joy
in the prospect of death.

492
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:34,925
Just thinking about it
can be a comfort,

493
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:40,097
like lying in your bed
and pulling up the covers.

494
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:45,060
The moment of death
is ecstatic.

495
00:26:45,061 --> 00:26:48,939
It's the most joyful sensation.

496
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:52,109
You're being born into
a new existence.

497
00:27:18,553 --> 00:27:21,597
- Is my father's illness
in my blood too?

498
00:27:25,435 --> 00:27:28,729
I wonder when he did it.

499
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:31,398
How much did it hurt?

500
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:36,070
And did it really
take the pain away?

501
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:08,102
- Party in my room tonight,
FYI.

502
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:09,645
- Okay.

503
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:21,532
- Hello, she.
What'd you bring me today?

504
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:23,492
- Hey, so tell me,
are you nervous?

505
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:25,244
- Of doing it?
- Yeah.

506
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:27,246
- Well, Kiki said
it wouldn't hurt that much.

507
00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:28,664
- I know.
It's just the whole thing.

508
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:30,082
I mean,
what if it feels weird?

509
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:33,419
Or what if you change your mind
right in the middle of it?

510
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:34,753
- I don't know.

511
00:28:34,754 --> 00:28:37,214
Part of me just wants
to get it over with, you know?

512
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:38,257
- Don't do that.

513
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:39,508
- We have to.
It hides the smell.

514
00:28:39,509 --> 00:28:40,926
- I mean it.
I'll have to leave.

515
00:28:40,927 --> 00:28:43,429
It'll suffocate me.
It's so sweet.

516
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:45,472
- All right.
You guys move to the window.

517
00:28:45,473 --> 00:28:47,850
We'll just
freeze our butts off.

518
00:28:50,687 --> 00:28:52,312
- Right.

519
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:55,983
- How does it feel?

520
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:58,152
- It's fine.
I don't even feel anything.

521
00:28:58,153 --> 00:29:00,863
- Are you serious, Becca?

522
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:03,073
- Are you okay?

523
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:06,076
Just lie down, okay?

524
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:08,078
- Don't cry about it.

525
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,677
- Speaking of yesterday,
of life.

526
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:24,678
Eccentric.

527
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:27,723
- What's going on?

528
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:41,445
- I need to tell you.

529
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:44,740
Listen to me.

530
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:47,201
I need to tell you,

531
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:50,204
tell you what it's like.

532
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:51,455
When I first came here,

533
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:54,041
we took the boat over.

534
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:57,252
I kept looking
at the gray waves,

535
00:29:57,253 --> 00:30:01,381
and I kept saying to myself,
"Jump, jump."

536
00:30:01,382 --> 00:30:06,345
But it was too cold.

537
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:09,807
The Brangwyn Hotel.

538
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:13,685
I arrived with the same secret
that you did:

539
00:30:13,686 --> 00:30:16,396
a father's suicide.

540
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:21,235
My mother brought me here
because she wanted to put

541
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:24,279
an ocean between his death
and me.

542
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:28,075
But to me,
an ocean was nothing.

543
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:29,576
Everywhere I went,

544
00:30:29,577 --> 00:30:34,665

it would just be really great

651
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:09,179
if we could get away.

652
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,638
I called John...

653
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:12,265
- Dora fell.

654
00:39:12,266 --> 00:39:15,101
She must have fallen.

655
00:39:15,102 --> 00:39:19,147
She went out there again
and slipped just like I did.

656
00:39:19,148 --> 00:39:20,982
Ernessa didn't walk
through glass.

657
00:39:20,983 --> 00:39:23,068
She couldn't.

658
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:24,486
The window
must have been open.

659
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:27,238
It was dark.

660
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:32,035
I won't let myself believe
things I know aren't possible.

661
00:39:44,757 --> 00:39:46,007
Hi.

662
00:39:46,008 --> 00:39:48,718
- Hi.

663
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:51,221
- Did you come in by train?

664
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:53,640
- My mom gave me a lift.

665
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:54,682
- How was your-

666
00:39:54,683 --> 00:39:57,227
- I got to return these
to the library.

667
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:59,145
- Wait.
Lucy, wait, please.

668
00:39:59,146 --> 00:40:01,523
I'm sorry.

669
00:40:01,524 --> 00:40:02,899
Last term, I just-

670
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:06,027
I guess I just got so jealous
of you and Ernessa.

671
00:40:06,028 --> 00:40:09,614
I think I went a little-

672
00:40:09,615 --> 00:40:11,783
I don't know.

673
00:40:11,784 --> 00:40:12,784
Crazy.

674
00:40:12,785 --> 00:40:15,412
I'm sorry.

675
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:16,663
- It's okay.

676
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:17,872
These things happen.

677
00:40:17,873 --> 00:40:20,625
- No, it's not okay.

678
00:40:20,626 --> 00:40:22,168
It's my fault about Dora.

679
00:40:22,169 --> 00:40:23,711
I made her go up on the roof.

680
00:40:23,712 --> 00:40:25,672
- Rebecca,
we all went up there.

681
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:27,924
You can't beat yourself up
over this.

682
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:29,509
- I've just been so stupid.

683
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:32,345
I-I hated being jealous.

684
00:40:32,346 --> 00:40:34,639
I never want to feel
like that again.

685
00:40:36,475 --> 00:40:39,769
- I didn't want to stop
being friends with you.

686
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:41,896
It's just that you wouldn't give
Ernessa a chance.

687
00:40:41,897 --> 00:40:45,191
- I've missed you so much.

688
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:50,029
- I missed you too.

689
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:57,203
- Let's just start over
and pretend like last term

690
00:40:57,204 --> 00:40:58,371
never even happened.

691
00:40:58,372 --> 00:40:59,664
- Yeah.

692
00:40:59,665 --> 00:41:01,291
It feels like
a bad dream anyway.

693
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:06,629
- But you have to be friends
with Ernessa.

694
00:41:08,257 --> 00:41:10,091
We were just talking
about you,

695
00:41:10,092 --> 00:41:12,510
how we should all
do something together.

696
00:41:12,511 --> 00:41:14,721
- Yes.
Let's.

697
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:17,265
- Maybe Sunday, we can all
go into town or something.

698
00:41:17,266 --> 00:41:18,308
- We could go to the movies.

699
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:19,309
- I would love that.

700
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:22,312
Oh, Sunday...

701
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:23,897
I booked two horses
to go riding.

702
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:24,898
- Oh...

703
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:26,065
- Can you ride?

704
00:41:26,066 --> 00:41:28,902
- No.

705
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:30,153
I never took lessons.

706
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:32,155
- We'll have to think
of something else.

707
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:33,156
We'll make a plan.

708
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:34,908
- We will for sure.

709
00:41:37,244 --> 00:41:38,912
- I'm sorry about Sunday.

710
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:41,664
But we're going to spend
a lot of time together

711
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:42,874
very soon.

712
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:45,210
We have so much in common.

713
00:41:52,051 --> 00:41:55,428
- "I heard a fly buzz
when I died.

714
00:41:55,429 --> 00:41:57,305
"But the stillness in the room

715
00:41:57,306 --> 00:41:59,724
"was like the stillness
in the air,

716
00:41:59,725 --> 00:42:01,976
between the heaves of storm."

717
00:42:01,977 --> 00:42:03,978
It's as if she's taking you
moment by moment

718
00:42:03,979 --> 00:42:06,314
through the experience
of dying.

719
00:42:07,733 --> 00:42:09,275
Okay, on that cheerful note,

720
00:42:09,276 --> 00:42:11,611
thank you very much, ladies.

721
00:42:14,782 --> 00:42:17,784
Uh, Rebecca?

722
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:19,619
I have something to show you.

723
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:28,795
It's a first edition
of your father's book.

724
00:42:28,796 --> 00:42:30,755
You know, I have to tell you,
I so admire

725
00:42:30,756 --> 00:42:33,174
the way your father kept writing
and working all those years.

726
00:42:33,175 --> 00:42:34,968
- The bank?

727
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:36,302
- Yes, the bank.

728
00:42:36,303 --> 00:42:38,346
- I think he kind of liked
having a real job.

729
00:42:38,347 --> 00:42:39,931
- You know,
I try to write at night,

730
00:42:39,932 --> 00:42:45,103
but there's marking papers,
and there's preparation.

731
00:42:45,104 --> 00:42:46,980
I don't know.

732
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:49,816
Sometimes I just feel my life
slipping away.

733
00:42:51,485 --> 00:42:53,987
- You know, with my dad,

734
00:42:53,988 --> 00:42:55,572
it feels like
all the bad stuff happened

735
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:57,740
when he was able to stay home
all day and write.

736
00:42:57,741 --> 00:43:00,410
- I will take that
as my inspiration.

737
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:03,329
He really is my hero,
you know.

738
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:05,415
- Mr. Davies?
- Yes?

739
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:06,749
- I need your supply list.

740
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:08,418
- Of course, uh-
- Thank you.

741
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:11,087
- I was just showing Rebecca
here this-this book.

742
00:43:11,088 --> 00:43:12,297
It's her father's.

743
00:43:12,298 --> 00:43:14,173
very rare.

744
00:43:14,174 --> 00:43:15,758
- Bye.

745
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:26,060
- Hey, are you joining
basketball?

746
00:43:26,061 --> 00:43:27,854
- I'm not going to do sports
this term.

747
00:43:27,855 --> 00:43:28,938
It's too tiring.

748
00:43:28,939 --> 00:43:29,981
- Why are you so tired?

749
00:43:29,982 --> 00:43:31,274
You know,
you should eat more.

750
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:33,276
- I do eat.
I eat all the time.

751
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:34,861
- I don't see you
at breakfast anymore.

752
00:43:34,862 --> 00:43:36,362
- I'm not hungry
in the morning.

753
00:43:36,363 --> 00:43:38,906
- You don't seem very hungry
at dinner either.

754
00:43:38,907 --> 00:43:42,243
- It's okay, Mom.
I'm fine.

755
00:43:42,244 --> 00:43:45,121
- Okay, okay.
I'm sorry.

756
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:46,956
I'll back off.

757
00:43:55,049 --> 00:43:56,716
Lucy?

758
00:43:58,761 --> 00:44:00,428
Where have you been?

759
00:44:00,429 --> 00:44:01,721
- I couldn't get up
this morning.

760
00:44:01,722 --> 00:44:03,014
I slept right through
the bell.

761
00:44:03,015 --> 00:44:05,642
- I see that Caroline Wallis
and Lucy Blake

762
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:08,478
were late for assembly.

763
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:11,314
You will report for detention
after classes.

764
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:14,275
Ernessa Bloch
has missed gymnastics

765
00:44:14,276 --> 00:44:16,736
for the fourth week
in a row.

766
00:44:16,737 --> 00:44:20,156
She will report to Miss Bobbie
to make up these classes.

767
00:44:20,157 --> 00:44:21,616
- Miss Bobbie
makes Ernessa swim laps

768
00:44:21,617 --> 00:44:23,993
every day after school.

769
00:44:23,994 --> 00:44:25,036
It's so unfair.

770
00:44:25,037 --> 00:44:27,413
It's like torture for her.

771
00:44:30,751 --> 00:44:33,252
- Now, into the pool.
Into the water.

772
00:44:33,253 --> 00:44:35,421
We don't have all afternoon.

773
00:44:40,427 --> 00:44:41,427
- Head up.
Breathe.

774
00:44:41,428 --> 00:44:42,470
Head down.

775
00:44:42,471 --> 00:44:44,430
Bend your elbows.

776
00:44:44,431 --> 00:44:45,431
Point your toes.

777
00:44:45,432 --> 00:44:46,683
Breathe.

778
00:45:07,788 --> 00:45:09,247
- Becca.

779
00:45:09,248 --> 00:45:12,625
I'm meeting Chris tonight
in the upper field to, uh...

780
00:45:12,626 --> 00:45:14,794
well, you know.

781
00:45:14,795 --> 00:45:15,878
- Really?

782
00:45:15,879 --> 00:45:17,338
- Yeah.

783
00:45:17,339 --> 00:45:19,757
I want you and Kiki
to keep guard.

784
00:45:19,758 --> 00:45:21,426
Will you do it?

785
00:45:21,427 --> 00:45:23,136
- Yeah, of course,
if you want us to.

786
00:45:23,137 --> 00:45:24,887
- Thank you.

787
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:38,067
- You know, if it rains tonight,
we're leaving.

788
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:29,327
- Can you see
their hovering spirits

789
00:46:29,328 --> 00:46:31,662
entwined through eternity?

790
00:46:31,663 --> 00:46:33,372
Just like a poem.

791
00:46:59,399 --> 00:47:01,567
- Hey, Rebecca.

792
00:47:06,949 --> 00:47:09,075
- So how was it?

793
00:47:09,076 --> 00:47:11,244
- It was kind of nothing.

794
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:14,789
I feel exactly the same way
I did before.

795
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:17,041
And I'm sure
I'm not in love with him.

796
00:47:17,042 --> 00:47:19,210
- Well, did you
at least enjoy it?

797
00:47:19,211 --> 00:47:20,670
- Not really.

798
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:22,255
Maybe I will
after I get used to it.

799
00:47:22,256 --> 00:47:24,048
- Okay.

800
00:47:24,049 --> 00:47:26,133
- I'm just glad
it's over with.

801
00:47:26,134 --> 00:47:28,970
I'm glad it was the first time
for both of us.

802
00:47:30,264 --> 00:47:31,806
- What is that?

803
00:47:35,853 --> 00:47:38,521
- Oh, my God.

804
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:42,441
- I regret to say
that a terrible accident

805
00:47:42,442 --> 00:47:45,945
has befallen one of our
teachers, Miss Bobbie.

806
00:47:45,946 --> 00:47:48,406
She died some time
last night.

807
00:47:48,407 --> 00:47:51,450
Please, girls, be quiet.

808
00:47:51,451 --> 00:47:53,035
Assembly is not yet over.

809
00:47:53,036 --> 00:47:56,747
Let us turn to hymn 51.

810
00:48:01,587 --> 00:48:06,757
♪ O, God,
our help in ages past ♪

811
00:48:06,758 --> 00:48:11,053
♪ Our hope for years to come ♪

812
00:48:11,054 --> 00:48:15,892
♪ Our shelter

- Rebecca.

815
00:48:21,315 --> 00:48:22,732
My mom came in early.

816
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:26,068
She won't let me come back
after spring break.

817
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:28,279
I shouldn't have said anything
about Miss Bobbie,

818
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:31,532
but I was so upset,
and I don't want to leave you.

819
00:48:34,077 --> 00:48:35,912
- All my friends are gone.

820
00:49:04,566 --> 00:49:08,444
Ernessa spends all her time
in Lucy's room.

821
00:49:08,445 --> 00:49:12,949
They always
keep the door shut.

822
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:16,369
Lucy's just a few feet away,

823
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:20,790
but she might as well be
on the other side of the world.

824
00:49:25,921 --> 00:49:27,129
- You look like death.

825
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:28,172
- It's cramps.

826
00:49:28,173 --> 00:49:30,091
I feel like I'm hemorrhaging.

827
00:49:30,092 --> 00:49:32,343
- I haven't had my period
in months.

828
00:49:33,845 --> 00:49:35,513
No, thanks.

829
00:49:35,514 --> 00:49:37,056
- How can you resist this?

830
00:49:37,057 --> 00:49:38,599
- Lucy, it's your favorite.

831
00:49:47,067 --> 00:49:49,068
- I'm going back to my room.

832
00:49:50,946 --> 00:49:53,364
- Okay, I have to talk to you
about Ernessa.

833
00:49:53,365 --> 00:49:55,825
- I'm not gonna indulge you
in your ridiculous obsession.

834
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:58,285
I'm sorry to say this,
but you're just jealous.

835
00:49:58,286 --> 00:49:59,954
- How can she survive
without eating?

836
00:49:59,955 --> 00:50:02,373
- I don't want to talk about
this anymore.

837
00:51:23,997 --> 00:51:25,831
- Wake up.
Wake up!

838
00:51:25,832 --> 00:51:27,666
Didn't you hear the sirens?

839
00:51:27,667 --> 00:51:29,543
- The what?

840
00:51:29,544 --> 00:51:31,587
- The ambulance.
They took Lucy.

841
00:51:31,588 --> 00:51:32,797
- What?

842
00:51:46,269 --> 00:51:47,770
I'll come back later.

843
00:51:56,905 --> 00:52:02,701
Something terrible
is happening to Lucy.

844
00:52:02,702 --> 00:52:04,870
I'm glad she's in hospital.

845
00:52:04,871 --> 00:52:07,748
At least she's away
from Ernessa.

846
00:52:14,256 --> 00:52:15,548
Hi.

847
00:52:17,092 --> 00:52:20,219
I brought you some chocolates
and a book.

848
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:21,846
- Thank you.

849
00:52:29,479 --> 00:52:30,646
- What's this?

850
00:52:30,647 --> 00:52:34,233
- Ernessa was just here.

851
00:52:34,234 --> 00:52:36,443
She brought that for me.

852
00:52:36,444 --> 00:52:37,987
I'm too tired to read.

853
00:52:37,988 --> 00:52:39,572
The book is so heavy.

854
00:52:39,573 --> 00:52:41,615
- Are you feeling any better?

855
00:52:41,616 --> 00:52:44,493
- It's not bad
feeling so weak.

856
00:52:44,494 --> 00:52:47,788
I just lie here
and think about breathing.

857
00:52:47,789 --> 00:52:49,081
- What happened to your flowers?

858
00:52:49,082 --> 00:52:51,584
They're all faded.

859
00:52:53,795 --> 00:52:56,338
- I guess they're starting
to die.

860
00:52:56,339 --> 00:52:58,757

00:53:49,392 --> 00:53:51,227
We're not allowed down there.

864
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:59,068
There's that same
horrible smell,

865
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:01,487
just like the one
from her room.

866

- Uh, sure.

873
00:54:31,059 --> 00:54:35,187
- It's my friend,
Lucy Blake.

874
00:54:35,188 --> 00:54:37,564
She hasn't been eating,
and now she's in the hospital.

875
00:54:37,565 --> 00:54:38,732
- Why don't we talk
in the car?

876
00:54:38,733 --> 00:54:39,900
- Yeah.

877
00:54:43,113 --> 00:54:47,700
There's this other girl,
Ernessa Bloch.

878
00:54:47,701 --> 00:54:49,702
She's just a bad influence
on Lucy.

879
00:54:49,703 --> 00:54:52,037
- What do you mean,
bad influence?

880
00:54:52,038 --> 00:54:55,541
- She's controlling her,
and Lucy just accepts it.

881
00:54:55,542 --> 00:54:57,668
- You think she's
enabling Ernessa?

882
00:54:57,669 --> 00:54:59,169
- Lucy adores her,

883
00:54:59,170 --> 00:55:01,714
but Ernessa doesn't have
her best interests at heart.

884
00:55:01,715 --> 00:55:04,383
I mean, Lucy's just getting
sicker and weaker and thinner,

885
00:55:04,384 --> 00:55:06,343
and Ernessa acts like
this is all good.

886
00:55:06,344 --> 00:55:08,929
- You're worried that she's
encouraging her eating disorder.

887
00:55:08,930 --> 00:55:10,764
- Well, it's more than that.
She's dangerous.

888
00:55:10,765 --> 00:55:13,267
She has some power over Lucy.

889
00:55:16,104 --> 00:55:18,314
- You know, cooped up here,
you girls get so close.

890
00:55:18,315 --> 00:55:21,317
All that emotion
can turn toxic.

891
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:23,193
I mean,
it's obvious Lucy needs help,

892
00:55:23,194 --> 00:55:26,071
but maybe you need to step away
for a little while.

893
00:55:26,072 --> 00:55:28,532
Put all this emotion
into your writing.

895
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:33,912
You're a very intelligent girl.

896
00:55:33,913 --> 00:55:36,540
You're one of the brightest
I've ever taught.

897
00:55:36,541 --> 00:55:38,417
You'll figure this out.

898
00:55:38,418 --> 00:55:39,501
Things get worse,

899
00:55:39,502 --> 00:55:40,961
don't be afraid
to come talk to me.

900
00:55:40,962 --> 00:55:42,212

901
00:55:42,213 --> 00:55:43,380

00:55:55,602 --> 00:55:57,353
- Is everything okay with you?

903
00:55:57,354 --> 00:55:58,354
- Not really.

904
00:55:58,355 --> 00:56:00,105
- You seem stressed.

905
00:56:00,106 --> 00:56:02,441
- I'm so worried about Lucy.

906
00:56:02,442 --> 00:56:03,609
It's been ten days,

907
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:04,818
and they still
won't let me see her.

908
00:56:04,819 --> 00:56:05,819
- Oh, she's much better.

909
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:07,446
- How do you know?

910
00:56:07,447 --> 00:56:08,489
- I don't know.

911
00:56:08,490 --> 00:56:09,615
- Come on.

912
00:56:09,616 --> 00:56:11,450
- Okay, Ernessa told me.

913
00:56:11,451 --> 00:56:12,493
She visited Lucy.

914
00:56:12,494 --> 00:56:13,994
- When?

915
00:56:13,995 --> 00:56:15,204
- Um, several times last week.

916
00:56:15,205 --> 00:56:16,872
- They let her see Lucy?

917
00:56:16,873 --> 00:56:18,290
- Well, Mrs. Rood
gave her permission,

918
00:56:18,291 --> 00:56:21,043
because she's Lucy's
very special friend.

919
00:56:23,546 --> 00:56:25,881
- You let Ernessa see her?

920
00:56:25,882 --> 00:56:27,674
- I don't know
what you're talking about.

921
00:56:27,675 --> 00:56:29,301
- You told me no visitors.

922
00:56:29,302 --> 00:56:31,136
Why would you let Ernessa
see her?

923
00:56:31,137 --> 00:56:34,098
- Lucy asked to see her.

924
00:56:34,099 --> 00:56:35,849
Now Ernessa can't visit her
either.

925
00:56:35,850 --> 00:56:37,267
- Well, she's my best friend.

926
00:56:37,268 --> 00:56:38,352
It's not fair.

927
00:56:38,353 --> 00:56:41,730
- Lucy has taken a turn
for the worse.

928
00:56:41,731 --> 00:56:44,483
The doctors don't think
she'll last the next few days.

929
00:56:44,484 --> 00:56:45,734
She's so weak.

930
00:56:45,735 --> 00:56:48,028
- No, l-

931
00:56:48,029 --> 00:56:49,655
I have to see her.

932
00:56:49,656 --> 00:56:51,698
I have to say good-bye.
I have to.

933
00:56:51,699 --> 00:56:53,617
- It's out of the question.

934
00:56:53,618 --> 00:56:56,328
Only family members
are allowed to visit.

935
00:56:57,497 --> 00:56:58,580
Oh!

936
00:56:58,581 --> 00:57:01,333
You disrespectful child!

937
00:57:06,423 --> 00:57:09,508
- You, me, Lucy?

938
00:57:09,509 --> 00:57:13,554
It would be better if we never
saw each other again.

939
00:57:13,555 --> 00:57:18,809
I'll give her up
if you just keep away from her.

940
00:57:18,810 --> 00:57:20,978
- Have you ever considered
how much we look alike?

941
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:48,881
- Miss Johnson,
the nurse...

942
00:57:48,882 --> 00:57:50,174
- Lucy.

943
00:57:50,175 --> 00:57:52,217
- She would bring me
all this green Jell-O.

944
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:55,053
- Lucy?

945
00:57:55,054 --> 00:57:56,054
- Look, she's back.

946
00:57:56,055 --> 00:57:57,306
And she's so much better.

947
00:57:57,307 --> 00:57:59,308
- Doctors think I'm a miracle.

948
00:58:11,738 --> 00:58:13,238
- Can I talk to you
about something?

949
00:58:13,239 --> 00:58:14,573
- Of course.

950
00:58:19,037 --> 00:58:21,705
- Look, I know what happened
with Dora and Miss Bobbie

951
00:58:21,706 --> 00:58:23,916
made everybody pretty crazy.

952
00:58:23,917 --> 00:58:25,792
- It'll calm down.

953
00:58:25,793 --> 00:58:27,711
Eventually, the school
will get back to normal.

954
00:58:27,712 --> 00:58:29,254
- No, it won't,

955
00:58:29,255 --> 00:58:30,756
because the person
who's doing this

956
00:58:30,757 --> 00:58:32,132
hasn't finished yet.

957
00:58:32,133 --> 00:58:33,884
She still has one more victim.

958
00:58:33,885 --> 00:58:34,968
It's the one she came for.

959
00:58:34,969 --> 00:58:36,470
The others,
they just got in her way.

960
00:58:36,471 --> 00:58:37,679
- I'm-I'm sorry?

961
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:39,848
- The girl I told you about,
Ernessa Bloch?

962
00:58:39,849 --> 00:58:42,309
- The next victim is who?

963
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:43,435
- Lucy Blake.

964
00:58:50,109 --> 00:58:51,443
- Why are you saying this?

965
00:58:51,444 --> 00:58:52,945
- Because this time,

966
00:58:52,946 --> 00:58:54,613
Lucy won't make it
to the hospital.

967
00:58:54,614 --> 00:58:55,948
- Rebecca, you know
what you're saying

968
00:58:55,949 --> 00:58:57,282
can't possibly be true.

969
00:58:57,283 --> 00:59:00,744
- Lucy got better when
the doctors banned all visitors.

970
00:59:00,745 --> 00:59:03,121
She got better because Ernessa
couldn't get to her.

971
00:59:03,122 --> 00:59:04,915
Ernessa won't let that
happen again.

972
00:59:04,916 --> 00:59:08,460
- Listen, Rebecca.

973
00:59:08,461 --> 00:59:10,671
I understand.

974
00:59:10,672 --> 00:59:12,506
This has been a difficult year
for you.

975
00:59:12,507 --> 00:59:13,674
You're still coming to terms

976
00:59:13,675 --> 00:59:15,133
with what happened
to your father,

977
00:59:15,134 --> 00:59:17,469
but you can't blame it all
on Ernessa.

978
00:59:17,470 --> 00:59:18,929
- It is Ernessa.

979
00:59:18,930 --> 00:59:20,180
Why can't anyone else
see that?

980
00:59:20,181 --> 00:59:21,932
- Rebecca.

981
00:59:24,852 --> 00:59:27,563
You're too young for all these
morbid thoughts.

982
01:00:09,439 --> 01:00:11,106
- Lucy?

983
01:00:13,109 --> 01:00:14,735
I know you're getting
sick again.

984
01:00:14,736 --> 01:00:16,695
I'm worried.
I need to call your mom.

985
01:00:19,198 --> 01:00:21,700
- I'm not sick.

986
01:00:21,701 --> 01:00:24,036
Really, I'm not sick.

987
01:00:24,037 --> 01:00:25,412
It's something else.

988
01:00:25,413 --> 01:00:28,290
- Don't you want your mom
to come get you?

989
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:29,708
- No, you can't call her.

990
01:00:29,709 --> 01:00:32,127
She'd come right away,
in the middle of the night.

991
01:00:32,128 --> 01:00:34,212
- Lucy, I just don't understand
why you won't let me help.

992
01:00:34,213 --> 01:00:35,547
- That's because
you just want to believe

993
01:00:35,548 --> 01:00:38,383
that I'm still the old Lucy.

994
01:00:38,384 --> 01:00:40,594
It's sad.

995
01:00:40,595 --> 01:00:43,597
You don't care about the new me,
the real Lucy.

996
01:00:43,598 --> 01:00:45,140
You don't even want
to know her.

997
01:00:45,141 --> 01:00:47,559
- This is all Ernessa's fault.

998
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:49,061
She's turned you against me.

999
01:00:49,062 --> 01:00:50,312
That's why you're saying this.

1000
01:00:50,313 --> 01:00:51,897
- Why do you want to blame her
for everything?

1001
01:00:51,898 --> 01:00:53,940
- Because she is to blame
for everything.

1002
01:00:53,941 --> 01:00:55,025
- No, no.

1003
01:00:55,026 --> 01:00:56,234
- If she hadn't come here
this year,

1004
01:00:56,235 --> 01:00:57,778
we would have had
a great year.

1005
01:00:57,779 --> 01:01:00,489
Don't you see she's ruined
everything for me?

1006
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:01,698
God, I hate her so much.

1007
01:01:01,699 --> 01:01:02,991
I'd kill her
if I had the chance.

1008
01:01:02,992 --> 01:01:04,743
- Don't talk like that.
It's sick.

1009
01:01:10,625 --> 01:01:13,335
- Look at yourself.

1010
01:01:13,336 --> 01:01:15,045
Tell me you don't look sick.

1011
01:01:15,046 --> 01:01:17,381
You can barely stand up.

1012
01:01:19,342 --> 01:01:21,426
- Look at yourself.

1013
01:01:23,137 --> 01:01:26,390
Just leave me alone, please.

1014
01:01:26,391 --> 01:01:30,060
I can't stand having you
around me all the time,

1015
01:01:30,061 --> 01:01:32,813
wanting me only for yourself.

You're a fucking drag.

1017
01:01:35,108 --> 01:01:38,652
You pull me down
with all your pain.

1018
01:01:42,573 --> 01:01:44,449
- You never said anything.

1019
01:02:01,467 --> 01:02:03,802
I'll never speak to her again.

1020

Thank you for coming to see me,
Rebecca.

They think you have some

Can you tell me a little
about his death?

1041
01:05:10,364 --> 01:05:13,700
- He slit his wrists.

1042
01:05:13,701 --> 01:05:14,951
Both of them.

1043
01:05:16,162 --> 01:05:17,537

the conversation

1046

you had the other day
with Mr. Davies.

1047

You don't really believe

do you?

He told you what I said?

1051
01:05:38,017 --> 01:05:39,184
- He talked to Miss Rood.

1052
01:05:39,185 --> 01:05:41,353
Obviously, he was concerned.

1053

Tea on the lawn
at the Brangwyn Hotel.

1083

We had picnics

"There's nothing
for you here."

One day, I filled the bath
