who's always thinking about

1132
01:22:18,356 --> 01:22:20,941
All the ways
to get to the end of it

1133
01:22:21,026 --> 01:22:23,486
You came around
And I think that I found

1134
01:22:23,570 --> 01:22:26,072
A good reason
to try and sit with it

1135
01:22:26,156 --> 01:22:28,699
You're taking me down
But I like the sound

1136
01:22:28,784 --> 01:22:31,202
And I want to get
with you anyway

1137
01:22:31,286 --> 01:22:33,579
Is this solid ground
Or am I getting drowned?

1138
01:22:33,663 --> 01:22:36,665
I'm just as happy
taking it day by day

1139
01:22:36,750 --> 01:22:41,420
And in the end
We all end up the same

1140
01:22:41,797 --> 01:22:46,509
Love and desire
Will be you once again

1141
01:22:46,843 --> 01:22:51,639
Life, listen and sing
We all end up the same

1142
01:22:52,015 --> 01:22:56,852
And in the end
It all goes up in flames

1143
01:23:01,775 --> 01:23:04,401
Scars on the skin
You're bringing me in

1144
01:23:04,486 --> 01:23:06,987
And I'm closer, closer
Every minute

1145
01:23:07,072 --> 01:23:09,406
We'll start to spin
And I'm in it to win

1146
01:23:09,491 --> 01:23:12,034
And I'm taking
every last bit of it

1147
01:23:12,119 --> 01:23:14,453
Looking at your face
Making my heart race

1148
01:23:14,538 --> 01:23:17,039
And I can't seem
Can't seem to make it stop

1149
01:23:17,124 --> 01:23:19,625
Sitting by your side
Want to go for a ride

1150
01:23:19,709 --> 01:23:22,461
And I'm waiting
Waiting for you to drive

1151
01:23:22,546 --> 01:23:27,550
And in the end
We all end up the same

1152
01:23:27,717 --> 01:23:32,805
Love and desire
Will be almost plain

1153
01:23:32,889 --> 01:23:37,852
Life, listen and sing
We all end up the same

1154
01:23:37,936 --> 01:23:42,857
And in the end
It all goes up in flames

1155
01:23:52,909 --> 01:23:53,909
