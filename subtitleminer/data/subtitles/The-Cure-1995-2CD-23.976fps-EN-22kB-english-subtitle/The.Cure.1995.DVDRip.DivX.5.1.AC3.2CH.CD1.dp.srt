1
00:01:29,715 --> 00:01:33,385
Hey, Erika, how is your
new boyfriend next door?

2
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:35,387
He's not next door, he's behind me,

3
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:36,805
I ain't never even seen him.

4
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:39,982
Who are your neighbors then,

5
00:01:40,017 --> 00:01:42,603
Gomer Pyle and his brother Goober?

6
00:01:42,895 --> 00:01:44,396
Eat shit...

7
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:45,522
What was that?

8
00:01:46,315 --> 00:01:48,025
Hey, come back here, faggot!

9
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:51,320
I said come back here!

10
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:48,812
Who's there?

11
00:03:49,897 --> 00:03:51,523
Are you asking me?

12
00:03:52,608 --> 00:03:54,026
Are you spying me?

13
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:57,613
No, I'm working on my mud fort,
what are you doing?

14
00:03:59,031 --> 00:04:00,699
I'm planting vegetables...

15
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:04,828
Thanks for moving in here,

16
00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:07,414
now the kids in school call me faggot

17
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:09,500
and walk on the other side of the hall...

18
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:10,918
I have to live somewhere...

19
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:14,338
Why don't you go inside, until
I get done working on my garden.

20
00:04:14,505 --> 00:04:16,096
Why?

21
00:04:16,131 --> 00:04:18,008
So I don't have to worry
about catching something,

22
00:04:18,043 --> 00:04:19,426
and dying!

23
00:04:19,927 --> 00:04:21,720
It can't be transmitted through the air.

24
00:04:24,223 --> 00:04:27,017
Just to be on the safe side,
I think you should go inside.

25
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:29,645
But I'm working on my mud fort...

26
00:04:35,317 --> 00:04:39,947
Hey, what would you do if I come over
there and whooped your ass?

27
00:04:42,241 --> 00:04:44,117
How long would that take?

28
00:04:44,243 --> 00:04:46,537
About ten seconds...

29
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:48,712
I would wait until you were finished

30
00:04:48,747 --> 00:04:50,916
and then I'd continue working on my mud fort.

31
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:53,836
You mean you'd just let me beat you up?

32
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:56,213
I'd try to stop you,

33
00:04:56,338 --> 00:04:59,132
but I probably won't be able to...
I'm not very big.

34
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:01,927
In that case it would only take 5 seconds...

35
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:06,348
So is that what you're gonna do?

36
00:05:09,852 --> 00:05:11,645
Maybe later...

37
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:16,316
Hello...

38
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:19,653
are you still there?

39
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:43,427
Shit!

40
00:05:51,627 --> 00:05:52,836
Son of a bitch!

41
00:05:57,049 --> 00:06:00,150
I warned you what would happen
if you got all dirty again...

42
00:06:18,351 --> 00:06:21,251
One, two, three, the winner!

43
00:06:29,451 --> 00:06:31,551
There's some boys outside playing baseball.

44
00:06:33,052 --> 00:06:35,952
If you can go make the effort
to get to know them,

45
00:06:36,453 --> 00:06:38,353
it'll be very nice...

46
00:06:39,054 --> 00:06:41,754
I'm gonna go out with some
girls from the office tonight,

47
00:06:41,755 --> 00:06:44,055
so cook yourself a dinner in microwave.

48
00:06:44,856 --> 00:06:47,756
Have you thought anymore about Colorado?

49
00:06:47,957 --> 00:06:49,257
I'm not going to camp!

50
00:06:49,358 --> 00:06:50,758
Yeah but if you just give it a chance,

51
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:51,859
you'd meet some extra friends...

52
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,760
Why can't I go see Dad?

53
00:06:56,961 --> 00:06:58,161
We'll call him,

54
00:06:58,162 --> 00:06:59,362
if he says yes,

55
00:06:59,363 --> 00:07:00,963
I'll put you on the next plane...

56
00:07:05,664 --> 00:07:07,664
You know, you and his little friend Cindy,

57
00:07:07,965 --> 00:07:10,465
can go to the movies
and get in for half price!

58
00:07:10,666 --> 00:07:12,066
She's 23, mom!

59
00:07:12,267 --> 00:07:14,767
Amazing, old enough to drink!

60
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:16,468
Yeah, but she doesn't...

61
00:07:21,669 --> 00:07:23,569
Man! I was on World Eight!

62
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:26,870
You know it's not good to spend too
much times with these games.

63
00:07:27,872 --> 00:07:30,353
What a bullshit! It's boring.

64
00:07:54,372 --> 00:07:57,072
I have nothing against going fishing,
but I'm not touching the worms.

65
00:07:58,073 --> 00:08:00,273
- I'll take care the worms.
- I'll take care the worms.

66
00:08:00,574 --> 00:08:02,174
- I will.
- Yeah, we'll see about that...

67
00:08:02,975 --> 00:08:03,975
Good night.

68
00:08:05,076 --> 00:08:06,076
Got ya first!

69
00:08:38,177 --> 00:08:42,077
They ended up giving me two pints of blood.
I guess it's a lot for baby.

70
00:08:42,778 --> 00:08:44,778
My grandmother said
you're going to hell,

71
00:08:44,979 --> 00:08:48,379
she says you'll suffer eternal torture
of a billion flames,

72
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,480
hotter than the center of the Sun.

73
00:08:50,781 --> 00:08:52,181
Then she must be some kind of genius...

74
00:08:53,182 --> 00:08:54,382
What?

75
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:56,083
My doctor's really smart,

76
00:08:56,384 --> 00:08:59,484
he says he has no idea what happens
to people after they die...

77
00:08:59,885 --> 00:09:01,885
If your grandmother knows,
she must be a genius.

78
00:09:02,286 --> 00:09:04,086
She's a clerk at K-Mart.

79
00:09:04,887 --> 00:09:06,887
Maybe she's just an underachiever.

80
00:09:07,188 --> 00:09:09,488
No, she's an idiot.

81
00:09:10,589 --> 00:09:12,589
So maybe I won't go to hell after all.

82
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:19,790
Are you sure those germs of yours
don't travel through the air?

83
00:09:20,991 --> 00:09:22,491
Yeah, Why?

84
00:10:00,392 --> 00:10:01,492
How old are you?

85
00:10:01,793 --> 00:10:02,893
Eleven.

86
00:10:03,294 --> 00:10:04,694
Jesus, you're a midget!

87
00:10:06,195 --> 00:10:10,195
Well, if you look at the lower limit
of what's considered normal for my age,

88
00:10:10,696 --> 00:10:12,796
I'm only 4 inches shorter.

89
00:10:14,497 --> 00:10:15,397
Oh...

90
00:10:18,398 --> 00:10:19,598
So...

91
00:10:22,899 --> 00:10:24,899
do you know how to play Battleship?

92
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,000
G9...

93
00:10:28,901 --> 00:10:30,001
Miss.

94
00:10:30,002 --> 00:10:31,202
Damn!

95
00:10:32,703 --> 00:10:33,603
Are you sure?

96
00:10:34,904 --> 00:10:35,804
Yup...

97
00:10:36,405 --> 00:10:37,505
D7...

98
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:41,906
Miss.

99
00:11:18,607 --> 00:11:19,907
I have to eat my lunch now.

100
00:11:20,308 --> 00:11:22,208
Why don't you just eat
whenever you're hungry?

101
00:11:22,909 --> 00:11:25,009
Cause if I only eat whenever
I was hungry, I wouldn't be here.

102
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:28,310
Do you wanna go to Peterson's?

103
00:11:29,111 --> 00:11:30,711
- What is that?
- It's a supermarket.

104
00:11:32,012 --> 00:11:33,012
Food...

105
00:11:34,713 --> 00:11:36,213
You got any money?

106
00:11:36,514 --> 00:11:37,714
In my bedroom.

107
00:11:42,315 --> 00:11:43,715
What should we do with him?

108
00:11:45,316 --> 00:11:46,516
You wanna burn him?

109
00:12:04,817 --> 00:12:06,317
Where did you get it all?

110
00:12:06,618 --> 00:12:08,318
Allowance...

111
00:12:08,419 --> 00:12:09,919
and fines.

112
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,020
Fines?

113
00:12:11,421 --> 00:12:13,221
It's a little hard to explain.

114
00:12:13,622 --> 00:12:16,222
This is great, since I know
where the store is,

115
00:12:16,323 --> 00:12:18,923
I'll be a the navigator
and you be treasurer.

116
00:12:19,024 --> 00:12:20,424
What's a treasurer will do?

117
00:12:20,925 --> 00:12:23,225
He carries all the money
and pays for things...

118
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:26,126
I'm to supposed to pay for both of us?

119
00:12:26,127 --> 00:12:28,627
I'm navigating for both of us,
you want to be fair don't you?

120
00:12:29,028 --> 00:12:30,028
How far is Peterson's?

121
00:12:30,329 --> 00:12:31,529
Why?

122
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:33,330
If I walk too far I get kinda tired.

123
00:12:37,031 --> 00:12:39,531
it'seems to me the depth of
the water would be the key...

124
00:12:39,732 --> 00:12:42,232
Obviously in the middle of the
ocean the shark would win.

125
00:12:42,433 --> 00:12:44,433
And on dry land the lion would win.

126
00:12:44,534 --> 00:12:46,134
So how much water are we talking about?

127
00:12:46,335 --> 00:12:47,835
2 and a half feet.

128
00:12:48,336 --> 00:12:49,836
And how big is the shark?

129
00:12:50,037 --> 00:12:51,437
Eleven feet.

130
00:12:53,238 --> 00:12:54,938
I'd still sayin' the lion would win...

131
00:12:55,239 --> 00:12:56,339
Wrong!

132
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,540
How can you be sure?

133
00:12:57,541 --> 00:12:59,741
Cause they did research on
Stanford University,

134
00:12:59,742 --> 00:13:01,342
the shark won easily.

135
00:13:02,343 --> 00:13:04,443
They just let two animals killed
each other at the college?

136
00:13:04,444 --> 00:13:08,344
No you idiot, they just had a fight
long enough to see who was gonna win,

137
00:13:08,345 --> 00:13:09,945
and then the trainers pulled them apart.

138
00:13:10,646 --> 00:13:11,446
How?

139
00:13:12,447 --> 00:13:13,847
Haven't you ever heard of a leash?

140
00:13:14,448 --> 00:13:15,848
Never heard a shark on a leash...

141
00:13:16,049 --> 00:13:18,849
Or there's a lot of things
you've never heard of.

142
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:20,650
I guess that's true...

143
00:13:20,651 --> 00:13:22,451
Hold on.

144
00:13:36,252 --> 00:13:39,252
My mom says that every drop
of water that lands in the water here,

145
00:13:39,353 --> 00:13:41,053
eventually end up in Mississippi.

146
00:13:41,254 --> 00:13:42,954
That means it goes to my dad,

147
00:13:43,055 --> 00:13:44,555
he still in New Orleans.

148
00:13:46,456 --> 00:13:47,656
What does he do?

149
00:13:48,157 --> 00:13:50,357
You've ever heard a rock
group called Led Zeppelin?

150
00:13:52,058 --> 00:13:52,758
No...

151
00:13:53,059 --> 00:13:54,659
They really famous,

152
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:56,760
you know who the guitar player is?

153
00:13:57,161 --> 00:13:57,961
Your dad?

154
00:13:58,362 --> 00:13:59,762
No, the guy named Jimmy Page,

155
00:14:00,163 --> 00:14:01,163
my daddy,

156
00:14:01,564 --> 00:14:04,164
sold him his car insurance.

157
00:14:05,265 --> 00:14:07,265
for a Pontiac TransAm...

158
00:14:08,866 --> 00:14:10,166
Know what you're gonna get?

159
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:13,267
I don't know, it's been a
long time since I've any candy.

160
00:14:14,368 --> 00:14:16,368
My mom has me eats a lot of vegetables.

161
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:19,070
Come here...

162
00:14:34,071 --> 00:14:34,871
We allowed to do this?

163
00:14:35,672 --> 00:14:38,172
Of course! How else are you supposed
to know what you're gonna get!

164
00:14:43,873 --> 00:14:47,073
- Wow!
- Not bad, huh...

165
00:14:48,574 --> 00:14:50,674
Well you got your money...

166
00:15:02,475 --> 00:15:04,575
Get out of the road!
Go on now!

167
00:15:05,376 --> 00:15:06,476
Asshole!

168
00:15:07,277 --> 00:15:08,277
3 degrees to the right,

169
00:15:08,978 --> 00:15:10,378
aim fire!

170
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:14,179
You missed!

171
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,780
Hey, how much did you pay for that faggot?

172
00:15:21,581 --> 00:15:23,081
You guys took a wrong turn,

173
00:15:23,082 --> 00:15:24,882
this is a no homo zone.

174
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:26,183
I ain't a homo!

175
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:28,084
And neither is he!

176
00:15:28,785 --> 00:15:30,485
He got from a blood transfusion...

177
00:15:30,586 --> 00:15:32,186
What tell what's that awful smell?

178
00:15:32,587 --> 00:15:36,387
Well, you see we were walking across the grass
and we accidentally stepped in your mother.

179
00:15:43,188 --> 00:15:44,388
What did you say?

180
00:15:49,489 --> 00:15:51,489
You can't hit it us all with that!

181
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:55,090
I only be aiming it at you...

182
00:16:08,791 --> 00:16:09,791
Come on then...

183
00:16:10,492 --> 00:16:11,892
And what about your little brother, huh?

184
00:16:13,993 --> 00:16:14,993
What about him?

185
00:16:15,394 --> 00:16:17,294
When he fell of the Jungle Jim at school,

186
00:16:17,295 --> 00:16:18,995
they'd to take him to the hospital,

187
00:16:18,996 --> 00:16:20,796
he could've caught something in...

188
00:16:20,897 --> 00:16:22,197
Yeah, but he didn't...

189
00:16:23,098 --> 00:16:24,398
But he could've!

190
00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:27,899
Then everybody be calling him
faggot and queer,

191
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:30,000
and he'd get sick and die!

192
00:16:30,401 --> 00:16:32,601
And you got homo on his headstone,

193
00:16:33,102 --> 00:16:34,702
and when your mother went
to bring him flowers,

194
00:16:34,803 --> 00:16:36,903
she would see her little Eddie Horner homo,

195
00:16:36,904 --> 00:16:39,004
You know the worst part of that would be?

196
00:16:39,005 --> 00:16:41,305
probably he before he died,
a bunch of assholes like you,

197
00:16:41,306 --> 00:16:42,306
who ain't sick and thought

198
00:16:42,307 --> 00:16:44,807
it might be fun just
to beat the shit out of him!

199
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:01,708
Come on man, let's beat!

200
00:17:15,109 --> 00:17:16,809
Sorry you're sick...

201
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:18,810
Thanks!

202
00:17:39,611 --> 00:17:40,911
What'd you do that for?

203
00:17:41,412 --> 00:17:42,412
Get 'em!

204
00:17:55,413 --> 00:17:57,413
So long faggots!

205
00:18:04,014 --> 00:18:06,114
Don't you think we should slow down?

206
00:18:07,815 --> 00:18:10,015
- How?
- Anyway would be fine!

207
00:18:17,716 --> 00:18:19,516
Ma'am get out of the way!

208
00:18:19,817 --> 00:18:21,617
- Move it!
- Move your ass!

209
00:18:25,718 --> 00:18:27,918
Oh God!

210
00:18:29,419 --> 00:18:31,419
Hold on! Go!

211
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,420
Go!

212
00:19:02,121 --> 00:19:03,721
So they really think I'm a faggot.

213
00:19:03,822 --> 00:19:06,122
Now all of a sudden I'm yelling
the same stuff at them.

214
00:19:06,323 --> 00:19:07,523
But they know I'm not a faggot,

215
00:19:07,623 --> 00:19:09,323
cause a faggot won't yell
a faggot back,

216
00:19:09,724 --> 00:19:11,224
Now that's why you should yell faggot too...

217
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:12,925
Well, just wouldn't be right saying that...

218
00:19:13,126 --> 00:19:14,226
Why the hell not!

219
00:19:15,827 --> 00:19:17,527
They were nice to me at the hospital,

220
00:19:17,528 --> 00:19:18,728
they played games with me...

221
00:19:18,829 --> 00:19:20,629
You played games with homos?

222
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:23,430
Just talk about something else...

223
00:19:23,631 --> 00:19:25,531
Sometimes I don't know about you.

224
00:19:26,532 --> 00:19:27,732
What's that supposed to mean?

225
00:19:29,133 --> 00:19:30,133
Nothing...

226
00:19:40,134 --> 00:19:41,934
Do you wanna play Nintendo?

227
00:19:43,135 --> 00:19:45,635
No... I'm getting kinda tired.

228
00:19:46,336 --> 00:19:47,736
I think I should go take a nap.

229
00:19:49,637 --> 00:19:51,537
We should work on the mud fort tomorrow,

230
00:19:51,638 --> 00:19:52,838
you want to?

231
00:19:56,839 --> 00:19:57,839
Okay.

232
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,140
Leave it...

233
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:14,541
Why can I eat in living room?

234
00:20:16,042 --> 00:20:17,642
I don't get home for dinner that often

235
00:20:17,743 --> 00:20:19,843
when I do, I want us to be together.

236
00:20:20,244 --> 00:20:22,344
It's part being a family, isn't it?

237
00:20:27,345 --> 00:20:30,545
You know some woman saw that little AIDS boy
down at the Peterson's yesterday..

238
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:31,946
It's in the newspaper?

239
00:20:32,248 --> 00:20:34,648
No... Jan told me...

240
00:20:35,449 --> 00:20:38,049
I've seen him in the backyard,
I didn't know he left the house.

241
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:44,350
The other day I heard him coughing.

242
00:20:47,251 --> 00:20:48,651
I said I heard him coughing.

243
00:20:49,152 --> 00:20:51,252
Oh, I don't think
you have to worry about anything,

244
00:20:51,853 --> 00:20:54,653
with that fence there,
you're not going to catch anything...

245
00:20:55,154 --> 00:20:57,254
What if wants to come over and play?

246
00:20:57,755 --> 00:21:00,055
Oh Erik, think of some excuse,

247
00:21:00,456 --> 00:21:01,856
you're so good at that...

248
00:21:04,357 --> 00:21:06,457
What if I bump into him out in the street?

249
00:21:06,658 --> 00:21:09,858
Well it's common sense,
you just keep a safe distance.

250
00:21:11,459 --> 00:21:13,359
What's a safe distance?

251
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:17,160
7 feet,

252
00:21:18,061 --> 00:21:20,261
guess that rules out sleepovers.

253
00:21:23,562 --> 00:21:25,262
My mom wants you to come to dinner.

254
00:21:26,363 --> 00:21:27,163
Well,

255
00:21:27,964 --> 00:21:30,564
mom's working late, so... cool.

256
00:21:32,365 --> 00:21:34,465
Well there's something
I have to warn you about...

257
00:21:35,166 --> 00:21:35,966
What?

258
00:21:37,867 --> 00:21:38,967
She likes to call me Sweetie.

259
00:21:41,268 --> 00:21:42,168
Sweetie?

260
00:21:43,269 --> 00:21:45,169
You gotta promise not to laugh.

261
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:49,870
You want some more carrots Sweetie?

262
00:21:50,171 --> 00:21:51,571
No, thanks.

263
00:21:54,472 --> 00:21:56,172
Are we ready for dessert then?

264
00:21:56,573 --> 00:21:59,073
- I'll try a little.
- Yeah I bet.

265
00:22:11,374 --> 00:22:14,074
You didn't even finish
your meatloaf, Love Muffin!

266
00:22:14,175 --> 00:22:15,275
Would you shut up!

267
00:22:16,977 --> 00:22:18,877
She's not gonna hear me sweetheart!

268
00:22:18,878 --> 00:22:19,878
Be quiet.

269
00:22:18,878 --> 00:22:21,578
You don't worry about it sweetie,
she's not gonna hear me!

270
00:22:23,779 --> 00:22:25,379
Here we go!

271
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:42,380
Dexter tells me you have a girlfriend.

272
00:22:42,581 --> 00:22:45,381
Yeah, well I did, but I have to dump her.

273
00:22:46,282 --> 00:22:47,982
Spin, spin, spin...

274
00:22:49,183 --> 00:22:50,983
His father has a girlfriend, named Cindy.

275
00:22:52,084 --> 00:22:53,884
Yes, as soon as they get settled in
their new apartment,

276
00:22:53,885 --> 00:22:55,185
I maybe goin' down there.

277
00:22:56,086 --> 00:22:57,486
And how's your mom feel about this.

278
00:23:02,287 --> 00:23:05,487
Actually we haven't really talk it out much

279
00:23:06,088 --> 00:23:07,088
yet...

280
00:23:10,089 --> 00:23:12,189
Well, I'd love to meet her.

281
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:14,990
She works quite a bit...

282
00:23:16,591 --> 00:23:19,191
20, 22 hours a day...

283
00:23:21,892 --> 00:23:22,992
What she do?

284
00:23:25,293 --> 00:23:26,393
A real estate

285
00:23:26,694 --> 00:23:28,794
and at night she works at a minimart.

286
00:23:29,195 --> 00:23:30,795
The one downtown...

287
00:23:34,896 --> 00:23:35,896
25 cents!

288
00:23:36,597 --> 00:23:37,797
I got you!

289
00:23:38,998 --> 00:23:41,698
Whenever I catch her twirling her hair,
she has to pay me a quarter.

290
00:23:41,799 --> 00:23:43,099
25 cents and this!

291
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,400
Are you gonna finish that?

292
00:23:50,401 --> 00:23:52,401
Well doctor says
"it's completely safe",

293
00:23:52,702 --> 00:23:55,302
but when it comes to
other people's children,

294
00:23:55,702 --> 00:24:01,202
we've decided not
to take any chances.

295
00:24:03,603 --> 00:24:04,903
Forgot...

296
00:24:06,604 --> 00:24:08,004
I've got plan...

297
00:24:09,105 --> 00:24:11,305
Just as soon as they find the cure,

298
00:24:11,506 --> 00:24:13,406
we're headin' out to Baskin Robbins,

299
00:24:13,507 --> 00:24:15,707
and ordering one of those monster sundaes

300
00:24:15,808 --> 00:24:18,008
where everybody just digs right in...

301
00:24:21,909 --> 00:24:24,109
It's a good plan...

302
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:42,310
What is it?

303
00:24:44,911 --> 00:24:46,711
She's afraid they might
not find the cure in time...

304
00:25:01,312 --> 00:25:02,512
Banzai!

305
00:25:03,213 --> 00:25:04,713
Oh my God!

306
00:25:06,314 --> 00:25:07,514
He's afraid of heights...

307
00:25:12,315 --> 00:25:13,815
Hey, what if they don't find the cure?

308
00:25:14,216 --> 00:25:15,616
I'm sure they will eventually...

309
00:25:16,117 --> 00:25:18,217
But what if they're looking
in the wrong place?

310
00:25:22,918 --> 00:25:23,818
What do you mean?

311
00:25:26,519 --> 00:25:28,319
Have you ever seen
that movie "Medicine Man"?

312
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:32,820
<i>We found a cure for cancer,</i>

313
00:25:32,921 --> 00:25:35,121
<i>and all you can say is: "I know"?</i>

314
00:25:43,022 --> 00:25:43,822
<i>What is it?</i>

315
00:25:44,123 --> 00:25:46,523
<i>Vermilliad. A flower.</i>

316
00:25:47,624 --> 00:25:48,924
You want me start eating flowers?

317
00:25:54,425 --> 00:25:56,125
We're not going to worry about what

318
00:25:56,426 --> 00:25:59,626
flowers, leaves maybe even pine cones.

319
00:26:00,427 --> 00:26:01,627
It can't hurt to try!

320
00:26:01,628 --> 00:26:04,428
My mom has me eating lots of vegetables,
especially broccoli.

321
00:26:04,429 --> 00:26:06,929
All I ever eat is candy and I never get sick.

322
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:09,630
Hey, that's it!

323
00:26:10,631 --> 00:26:13,531
Somebody gets sick and
all they eat is fruits and vegetables,

324
00:26:13,932 --> 00:26:16,232
it's the one thing they stop eating!

325
00:26:33,433 --> 00:26:34,433
This is stupid.

326
00:26:36,134 --> 00:26:39,334
About fifty years ago, a doctor knows
some mold was growing on his bread,

327
00:26:40,735 --> 00:26:42,235
he started feeding it to people...

328
00:26:43,136 --> 00:26:45,136
and everybody said "this is stupid",

329
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:48,237
you know what it out turned to be? Aspirin!

330
00:26:59,838 --> 00:27:01,338
It's still a hundred-point-two.

331
00:27:02,639 --> 00:27:04,439
- How are ya feeling?
- Okay.

332
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,240
Let's start "Butterfinger"

333
00:27:12,141 --> 00:27:14,641
combine with "Bubbelicious".

334
00:27:16,642 --> 00:27:19,342
I am not sure I understand
why you have to try this all stuff too.

335
00:27:21,043 --> 00:27:23,543
Don't you know anything
about scientific method?

336
00:27:23,544 --> 00:27:24,544
Little.

337
00:27:25,745 --> 00:27:29,545
You have to have a control group,
so you'll see if the results are uniform...

338
00:27:29,946 --> 00:27:31,346
You're in control group?

339
00:27:31,847 --> 00:27:32,647
Yup.

340
00:28:04,748 --> 00:28:05,548
Hallo...

341
00:28:06,249 --> 00:28:07,249
Is Dexter here?

342
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:09,450
Yes, he is, but he's grounded.

343
00:28:10,651 --> 00:28:11,351
Why?

344
00:28:12,552 --> 00:28:15,252
Because he used up all his money,
buying candy.

345
00:28:22,053 --> 00:28:23,353
How long is he grounded for?

346
00:28:24,254 --> 00:28:25,554
Till tomorrow...

347
00:28:29,055 --> 00:28:29,855
Why's that?

348
00:28:30,856 --> 00:28:32,456
We're gonna play submarine.

349
00:28:33,457 --> 00:28:34,757
Grounded is grounded, so

350
00:28:35,258 --> 00:28:36,858
you're gonna have to wait till tomorrow...

351
00:28:37,159 --> 00:28:38,159
I understand.

352
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:42,360
Just a minute, okay?

353
00:28:43,861 --> 00:28:46,061
Dexter, get your ass down here!

354
00:28:46,362 --> 00:28:47,062
Why?

355
00:28:47,162 --> 00:28:50,562
Coz I'm changing your punishment,
you have to play with Erik!

356
00:28:56,563 --> 00:28:59,263
- Thanks mom!
- Here's your paddle.

357
00:28:59,564 --> 00:29:00,564
Watch the flowers!

358
00:29:05,565 --> 00:29:06,565
How are you feeling?

359
00:29:07,866 --> 00:29:08,766
Terrible.

360
00:29:09,767 --> 00:29:12,167
Told you candy was a stupid idea...

361
00:29:20,568 --> 00:29:21,868
Hey, what'd ya think of this one?

362
00:29:23,069 --> 00:29:24,469
I'm wondering about something...

363
00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:27,470
Where do bugs go to bathroom?

364
00:29:28,071 --> 00:29:29,171
It's not on leaves.

365
00:29:29,572 --> 00:29:31,072
How can you be sure?

366
00:29:31,673 --> 00:29:32,973
Because bugs eat leaves,

367
00:29:33,174 --> 00:29:36,174
not even bugs are stupid
enough to shit on their own food...

368
00:29:39,475 --> 00:29:40,675
Now, what do you say?

369
00:29:58,276 --> 00:29:59,276
Go ahead...

370
00:30:05,977 --> 00:30:08,177
Oh, tastes like crap!

371
00:30:08,678 --> 00:30:10,878
No shit, don't you know
where bugs go to bathroom?

372
00:30:26,379 --> 00:30:27,679
Sweetened crap.

373
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,380
It looks too weird...

374
00:30:53,981 --> 00:30:55,281
You can't be afraid to try...

375
00:30:56,682 --> 00:30:57,782
I'm afraid to touch it.

376
00:31:21,683 --> 00:31:22,483
How do you feel?

377
00:31:23,084 --> 00:31:23,684
Okay.

378
00:31:27,085 --> 00:31:27,785
She's here!

379
00:31:43,186 --> 00:31:44,186
Dexter?

380
00:32:20,187 --> 00:32:20,987
You got me!

381
00:32:23,588 --> 00:32:24,588
Dexter?

382
00:32:25,189 --> 00:32:27,389
Is your friend Erik staying
for dinner again?

383
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:29,290
Wakkah!

384
00:32:29,891 --> 00:32:31,891
That means yes, white woman!

385
00:32:33,892 --> 00:32:35,392
Okay, hey, Allie.

386
00:32:45,993 --> 00:32:48,793
Settle down! Go get some yogurt.

387
00:32:50,394 --> 00:32:51,394
Wakkah!

388
00:32:56,495 --> 00:32:58,295
You guys really very well nuts today!

389
00:33:02,796 --> 00:33:03,996
Did Dexter take his nap?

390
00:33:04,697 --> 00:33:05,597
"Oekoo"

391
00:33:48,098 --> 00:33:48,898
Sorry.

392
00:33:51,399 --> 00:33:52,299
Good night.

393
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,100
I need to take Dexter
to his doctor tomorrow,

394
00:34:07,201 --> 00:34:08,501
we should back at one...

395
00:34:10,402 --> 00:34:11,702
- Good night
- Good night.

396
00:34:26,703 --> 00:34:28,503
Shit! The notebook!

397
00:35:17,704 --> 00:35:18,904
Where have you been?

398
00:35:24,405 --> 00:35:27,205
- I thought you won't...
- I asked you a question!

399
00:35:31,206 --> 00:35:34,006
Gordy Johnson asked me
if I wanna go to the mall with him,

400
00:35:34,707 --> 00:35:36,807
and I didn't think you'd won't mind.

401
00:35:41,408 --> 00:35:44,008
Is that that doctor's boy?

402
00:35:46,009 --> 00:35:46,909
Yeah...

403
00:35:51,010 --> 00:35:54,010
You really should've left a note for me...

404
00:35:59,111 --> 00:36:02,111
Maybe Gordy would like to go
with us to see the fireworks.

405
00:36:04,712 --> 00:36:05,712
Maybe...

406
00:36:17,002 --> 00:36:18,387
These are pennies?

407
00:36:21,006 --> 00:36:22,006
There's one, two...

408
00:36:25,010 --> 00:36:28,063
three... that's a dime,
isn't it? Oh, dear.

409
00:36:31,016 --> 00:36:31,716
There!

410
00:36:32,217 --> 00:36:34,817
Thank you very much, so neat of you!

411
00:36:42,218 --> 00:36:44,018
Oh, my God!

412
00:36:45,719 --> 00:36:48,819
The mysterious Dr. Fishburn
derives the extract from a plant,

413
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:51,320
found deep in the Louisiana bayou.

414
00:36:51,521 --> 00:36:54,021
At a backwater location he refuses to reveal...

415
00:36:54,522 --> 00:36:56,222
I knew it, it was a plant...

416
00:36:56,423 --> 00:36:58,823
The government's trying
to suppress its findings...

417
00:36:59,024 --> 00:36:59,924
Bastard!

418
00:37:00,025 --> 00:37:01,625
Why would they do that?

419
00:37:01,926 --> 00:37:03,526
Because they're embarrassed.

420
00:37:03,627 --> 00:37:06,327
I'm mean, think about the money
they spend each year,

421
00:37:06,328 --> 00:37:10,828
and this Dr. Fishburn got goes out in his
backyard in his underwear one morning,

422
00:37:10,829 --> 00:37:12,829
and picks up the cure for AIDS!

423
00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:17,030
Maybe your mom could drive us down there!

424
00:37:22,731 --> 00:37:23,831
It's right here!

425
00:37:23,932 --> 00:37:27,232
I don't want you boys thinking that
something like this cannot happen,

426
00:37:27,233 --> 00:37:30,333
but if it does and Dr. Jensen's gonna
know about it before the National...

427
00:37:30,734 --> 00:37:31,534
"Examiner"

428
00:37:31,635 --> 00:37:32,535
Examiner!

429
00:37:32,536 --> 00:37:33,736
Why don't we call him?

430
00:37:34,237 --> 00:37:35,337
No!

431
00:37:35,838 --> 00:37:38,938
Why don't we wait till your next appointment
and you can ask the man!

432
00:37:40,139 --> 00:37:41,739
It's for after lunch.

433
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:44,240
Like I didn't see that?

434
00:37:46,141 --> 00:37:48,741
You say your dad lives
in New Orleans, right?

435
00:37:50,042 --> 00:37:50,742
Yeah...

436
00:37:52,943 --> 00:37:55,543
Maybe he can get that some
of that secret extracts

437
00:37:55,644 --> 00:37:57,444
mail it to us...

438
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:03,145
Maybe it's already here...

439
00:38:04,046 --> 00:38:05,146
That one again?

440
00:38:07,147 --> 00:38:07,647
Yup...

441
00:38:08,348 --> 00:38:09,748
I just don't like it...

442
00:38:09,849 --> 00:38:10,849
Look at that thing,

443
00:38:10,850 --> 00:38:12,450
he's got all the look like a plant from the bayou,

444
00:38:12,452 --> 00:38:14,152
then I don't know bayous.

445
00:38:19,453 --> 00:38:21,153
This is the worse yet!

446
00:38:21,254 --> 00:38:24,354
My grandma says, that the
worst it tastes, the better it works.

447
00:38:26,355 --> 00:38:27,855
Your K-Mart clerk grandma?

448
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:31,656
Drink!

449
00:38:55,657 --> 00:38:57,557
I need to talk to Erik,

450
00:38:57,558 --> 00:39:01,258
some kind of leaf that he took in...

451
00:39:01,259 --> 00:39:02,259
Erik has something to do with this?

452
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:06,560
Erik, Erik...

453
00:39:06,561 --> 00:39:08,661
I need to know what you gave Dexter...

454
00:39:08,762 --> 00:39:11,062
I need to know what kind
of leaves you gave him,

455
00:39:11,163 --> 00:39:14,563
it's poisonous and he told me that
you have written it down in a notebook.

456
00:39:22,164 --> 00:39:24,364
Here's one it this,
it's down by the river...

457
00:39:24,365 --> 00:39:27,065
Where? Where the bridge crosses...

458
00:39:49,766 --> 00:39:51,066
Back inside...

459
00:39:59,767 --> 00:40:02,267
What were you thinking?

460
00:40:03,868 --> 00:40:04,868
What!

461
00:40:05,469 --> 00:40:06,269
Tell me!

462
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:07,770
Tell me!

463
00:40:09,971 --> 00:40:12,871
Not measles, not chicken pox, aids!

464
00:40:13,272 --> 00:40:14,272
What're you trying to do?

465
00:40:14,773 --> 00:40:15,873
What are you trying to do!

466
00:40:15,974 --> 00:40:17,474
Fucking kill us both?

467
00:40:18,675 --> 00:40:20,475
There's gonna be some big changes around here!

468
00:40:20,876 --> 00:40:21,876
Big changes!

469
00:40:40,477 --> 00:40:42,077
I don't really care what do you think,

470
00:40:43,078 --> 00:40:44,478
I don't want him over here,

471
00:40:44,879 --> 00:40:46,379
I don't want my son over there!

472
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,380
I don't care that they're friends,

473
00:40:48,681 --> 00:40:50,981
I don't want them
associating with each other.

474
00:40:50,982 --> 00:40:51,982
Period!

475
00:41:08,483 --> 00:41:10,383
He's gonna be fine. Thank god!

476
00:41:11,284 --> 00:41:13,084
His mother is officially on notice,

477
00:41:14,485 --> 00:41:15,885
she allows him to see you
I'm gonna have her ass

478
00:41:15,986 --> 00:41:17,686
thrown in jail.

479
00:41:18,087 --> 00:41:19,487
And for you,

480
00:41:20,388 --> 00:41:23,388
on Monday morning your
ass are going to summer camp!

481
00:41:46,889 --> 00:41:47,689
Hey Dad?

482
00:41:47,690 --> 00:41:52,390
<i>Sorry, we missed you. Cindy and I are in Lake Charleston
until Tuesday. Call you as soon as we get back...</i>

483
00:42:22,691 --> 00:42:23,991
When we're get down there,

484
00:42:25,092 --> 00:42:27,292
where we're gonna sleep,
where we gonna eat...

485
00:42:27,393 --> 00:42:28,793
We're not worry about that,

486
00:42:28,994 --> 00:42:31,494
I already talked to my dad,
he said we could stay with him...

487
00:42:32,495 --> 00:42:34,895
I might even be able to
talk him to take us fishing.

488
00:42:37,996 --> 00:42:39,196
I can't.

489
00:42:39,597 --> 00:42:40,897
You have to Dex!

490
00:42:40,998 --> 00:42:42,598
Tomorrow morning I'm out of here.

491
00:42:42,599 --> 00:42:44,399
And this time she would be
really really worried.

492
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,000
She's already worried because you're sick.

493
00:42:47,701 --> 00:42:50,701
And you and I both know that the
only thing that's gonna make her happy,

494
00:42:51,102 --> 00:42:54,302
is when we're going to New Orleans
and Dr. Fishburn has the cure...

495
00:43:04,803 --> 00:43:06,603
<i>Dear mom... I'm fine with Erik...</i>

496
00:43:07,104 --> 00:43:09,704
<i>but I brought along the medicines
so there's no reason to worry.</i>

497
00:43:10,605 --> 00:43:13,005
<i>We're planning to be careful
and sensible.</i>

498
00:43:13,406 --> 00:43:16,406
<i>Whatever you do make sure you
remember to tape Star Wars</i>

499
00:43:16,507 --> 00:43:17,707
<i>8 PM channel 5.</i>

500
00:43:18,808 --> 00:43:22,608
<i>I love you very much, sincerely Dexter...</i>

501
00:45:22,809 --> 00:45:26,309
The biggest fish in the world,
he weights over 2000 pounds...

502
00:45:26,910 --> 00:45:29,010
That's why they calling him
the General Steur.

503
00:45:30,411 --> 00:45:31,811
What if he decides to take us over?

504
00:45:32,812 --> 00:45:33,812
He wouldn't know that...

505
00:45:35,613 --> 00:45:36,813
One time this kid,

506
00:45:37,114 --> 00:45:38,714
he went swimming after eating,

507
00:45:38,915 --> 00:45:41,215
and he got a stomach cramp,
and he started to dry on

508
00:45:41,416 --> 00:45:44,116
but the General Steur grabbed him by shirt

509
00:45:44,117 --> 00:45:45,417
and put him on the shore.

510
00:45:50,018 --> 00:45:51,418
How fast do you think we're going?

511
00:45:55,019 --> 00:45:56,819
3 miles an hour.

512
00:45:59,020 --> 00:46:00,620
How far is this New Orleans?

513
00:46:02,121 --> 00:46:03,621
About 12 hundred miles.

514
00:46:08,622 --> 00:46:10,122
How long will it takes us to get there?

515
00:46:22,823 --> 00:46:24,523
Hey, where you headed?

516
00:46:25,424 --> 00:46:26,524

517
00:46:31,625 --> 00:46:32,625

518
00:46:32,826 --> 00:46:33,826
Memphis

519
00:46:34,127 --> 00:46:35,127
Centralia

520
00:46:35,528 --> 00:46:36,528
Peoria

521
00:46:36,629 --> 00:46:37,929
How much you got?

522
00:46:39,230 --> 00:46:39,930
What?

523
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:43,131
Wanna ride you gotta
pay for the gas, you know...

524
00:46:44,232 --> 00:46:45,332
Where you headed?

525
00:46:45,933 --> 00:46:46,933
New Orleans...

526
00:46:47,834 --> 00:46:49,534

527
00:46:49,635 --> 00:46:50,735
20 bugs?

528
00:46:50,836 --> 00:46:53,236
You wanna go to New Orleans for 20 bugs?

529
00:46:53,837 --> 00:46:55,937
I don't know, I think you're gonna
have to do better than that.

530
00:47:00,938 --> 00:47:03,538
Forty, it's all I got.

531
00:47:03,739 --> 00:47:05,839
Hey Pony, we ready to float, man!

532
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:07,840
What are you saying, we locked and loaded?

533
00:47:07,941 --> 00:47:09,341
Alright.

534
00:47:15,542 --> 00:47:16,842
162 dollars,

535
00:47:17,543 --> 00:47:19,343
check my pockets.
