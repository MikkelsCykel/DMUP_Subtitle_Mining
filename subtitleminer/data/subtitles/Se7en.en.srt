00:00:55,575 --> 00:00:57,054
Neighbours heard them
screaming at each other...

2
00:00:57,495 --> 00:00:59,451
Iike,for two hours.
Nothing new.

3
00:00:59,895 --> 00:01:01,886
Then they heard the gun go off,
both barrels.

4
00:01:03,215 --> 00:01:05,410
Crime of passion.

5
00:01:07,255 --> 00:01:09,405
Just look at all
the passion on that wall.

6
00:01:09,855 --> 00:01:12,449
Well, it's a done deal,
all but the paperwork.

7
00:01:15,935 --> 00:01:17,766
The kid see it?

8
00:01:18,215 --> 00:01:20,206
-What?
-The kid.

9
00:01:20,655 --> 00:01:23,772
What kind of
fucking question is that?

10
00:01:24,215 --> 00:01:25,568
We are all going
to be real glad...

11
00:01:26,015 --> 00:01:28,006
when we get rid of you,
Somerset.

12
00:01:28,455 --> 00:01:29,649
It's always
these questions with you.

13
00:01:30,095 --> 00:01:31,767
"Did the kid see it?"
Who gives a fuck?

14
00:01:32,215 --> 00:01:33,694
He's dead.
His wife killed him.

15
00:01:34,135 --> 00:01:36,968
Anything else,
it has nothing to do with us.

16
00:01:44,575 --> 00:01:46,645
Detective Somerset?

17
00:01:47,095 --> 00:01:49,404
I'm Detective Mills.

18
00:01:49,855 --> 00:01:51,925
Lieutenant,
I apologize for interrupting.

19
00:01:52,375 --> 00:01:56,129
I get in town 20 minutes ago,
they dump me here.

20
00:01:56,575 --> 00:01:58,054
Look, Mills?

21
00:01:58,495 --> 00:02:00,531
I thought we might
find a bar someplace.

22
00:02:00,975 --> 00:02:02,852
I'd like to get to the precinct,
if it's all the same.

23
00:02:03,295 --> 00:02:05,729
Not much time
for this transition thing.

24
00:02:06,175 --> 00:02:07,608
I meant to ask you something...

25
00:02:08,055 --> 00:02:10,523
when we spoke
on the phone before.

26
00:02:11,935 --> 00:02:14,927
-Why here?
-I don't follow.

27
00:02:15,375 --> 00:02:18,173
Well, all this effort
to get transferred.

28
00:02:18,615 --> 00:02:22,085
It's the first question
that popped into my head.

29
00:02:22,535 --> 00:02:24,969
I guess the same reasons
as you had...

30
00:02:25,415 --> 00:02:27,326
before you decided to quit,
yeah?

31
00:02:28,775 --> 00:02:31,528
You just met me.

32
00:02:31,975 --> 00:02:34,887
Maybe I'm not understanding
the question.

33
00:02:35,335 --> 00:02:37,007
It's very simple.

34
00:02:37,455 --> 00:02:41,289
You actually fought
to get reassigned here.

35
00:02:41,735 --> 00:02:43,532
I've just never seen it
done that way before.

36
00:02:43,975 --> 00:02:45,090
I thought
I could do some good.

37
00:02:45,535 --> 00:02:47,173
It would be great for me
if we didn't start out...

38
00:02:47,615 --> 00:02:50,413
kicking each other
in the balls.

39
00:02:50,855 --> 00:02:52,368
But you're calling the shots,
Lieutenant.

40
00:02:52,815 --> 00:02:57,889
Yes. I want you to look,
and I want you to listen.

41
00:02:58,335 --> 00:03:00,371
I wasn't guarding the Taco Bell.

42
00:03:00,815 --> 00:03:01,884
I've worked Homicide five years.

43
00:03:02,335 --> 00:03:03,734
-Not here.
-I understand that.

44
00:03:04,175 --> 00:03:05,574
Over the next seven days,
Detective...

45
00:03:06,015 --> 00:03:08,529
you'll do me the favour
of remembering that.

46
00:06:48,175 --> 00:06:49,654
Say it again.

47
00:06:51,615 --> 00:06:55,767
I thought we moved here
to get away from tractor pulls.

48
00:07:00,575 --> 00:07:02,566
Serpico's got to go.

49
00:07:03,015 --> 00:07:07,850
You might want to get rid of
this little crusty eye, Serpico.

50
00:07:08,295 --> 00:07:09,774
-Did you get it?
-Got it.

51
00:07:10,215 --> 00:07:11,330
Good.

52
00:07:26,855 --> 00:07:28,447
Coffee? No?

53
00:07:32,255 --> 00:07:35,247
Nothing's been touched.
Everything's like I found it.

54
00:07:35,695 --> 00:07:37,208
What time was death established?

55
00:07:37,655 --> 00:07:40,294
Like I said,
I didn't touch anything...

56
00:07:40,735 --> 00:07:42,885
but he's had his face
in a plate of spaghetti...

57
00:07:43,335 --> 00:07:44,768
for about
forty-five minutes now.

58
00:07:45,215 --> 00:07:47,046
No one bothers with vital signs?

59
00:07:47,495 --> 00:07:49,326
Did I stutter?
This guy ain't breathing...

60
00:07:49,775 --> 00:07:51,493
unless he started
breathing spaghetti sauce.

61
00:07:51,935 --> 00:07:53,368
So that's how
it's done around here?

62
00:07:53,815 --> 00:07:54,850
I beg your pardon, Detective...

63
00:07:55,295 --> 00:07:57,809
this guy's sitting in
a pile of his own piss and shit.

64
00:07:58,255 --> 00:08:00,485
If he wasn't dead,
he would have stood up by now.

65
00:08:00,935 --> 00:08:02,448
Thank you, Officer.

66
00:08:02,895 --> 00:08:04,726
Thank you.

67
00:08:13,015 --> 00:08:14,687
I wonder...

68
00:08:16,295 --> 00:08:17,967
What exactly was the point...

69
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:20,883
of the conversation
you were about to get into?

70
00:08:21,335 --> 00:08:23,610
Don't know. How many times
has Barney Fife...

71
00:08:24,055 --> 00:08:25,886
found dead bodies
that weren't dead?

72
00:08:27,415 --> 00:08:28,734
Drop it.

73
00:08:57,895 --> 00:09:01,444
Somebody phone Guinness.
I think we've got a record here.

74
00:09:17,295 --> 00:09:19,172
"Better Homes and Gardens."

75
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:31,094
Who said this was murder?

76
00:09:31,535 --> 00:09:33,924
No one.

77
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:38,493
His heart has got to be
the size of a canned ham.

78
00:09:40,815 --> 00:09:42,885
If this isn't a coronary...

79
00:09:43,335 --> 00:09:46,168
well, I don't know.

80
00:10:10,335 --> 00:10:12,405
How about that?

81
00:10:21,175 --> 00:10:23,643
We had this case once...

82
00:10:24,095 --> 00:10:28,373
guy dead on the ground,
knife in his back.

83
00:10:28,815 --> 00:10:30,567
Got to be murder, right?

84
00:10:31,615 --> 00:10:32,650
Fuck.

85
00:10:33,095 --> 00:10:35,563
Anyway, big insurance policy
involved, yeah?

86
00:10:36,015 --> 00:10:38,210
The guy took
the tip of the blade...

87
00:10:38,655 --> 00:10:40,611
stuck it in
his own shoulder blades.

88
00:10:41,055 --> 00:10:43,649
Must've screwed up a few times.
There was multiples.

89
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:45,892
Could you please be quiet?

90
00:10:55,335 --> 00:10:56,450
Wait a minute.

91
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:58,248
What?

92
00:11:00,415 --> 00:11:04,203
-Got a bucket here.
-What's in it?

93
00:11:09,135 --> 00:11:12,650
Oh, God! Fucking vomit.

94
00:11:14,535 --> 00:11:15,729
Any blood in it?

95
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:18,609
I didn't see any.
Help yourself.

96
00:11:24,015 --> 00:11:25,767
Are you thinking it's poison?

97
00:11:26,215 --> 00:11:29,093
Wonderful. Very moody.

98
00:11:29,535 --> 00:11:30,763
Are you thinking
it's poison, Somerset?

99
00:11:31,215 --> 00:11:33,524
You girls have got
Forensics waiting outside.

100
00:11:33,975 --> 00:11:36,409
I don't know
if we'll all fit, though.

101
00:11:36,855 --> 00:11:39,085
There's room.
Light's the problem. Hi.

102
00:11:39,535 --> 00:11:42,254
Detective Mills, would you
go help the officers...

103
00:11:42,695 --> 00:11:44,492
question the neighbours?

104
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:47,490
What?

105
00:11:47,935 --> 00:11:51,450
Send in Forensics
on your way out, please.

106
00:12:04,455 --> 00:12:05,968
He's dead.

107
00:12:07,535 --> 00:12:09,446
Thank you, Doctor.

108
00:12:14,255 --> 00:12:17,133
You've seen my files, right?
Things I've done?

109
00:12:21,975 --> 00:12:24,125
Well, I did my time
walking the beat.

110
00:12:24,255 --> 00:12:26,849
I did that shit for a long time.

111
00:12:27,295 --> 00:12:28,364
And?

112
00:12:28,815 --> 00:12:31,773
My badge says Detective,
the same as yours.

113
00:12:32,215 --> 00:12:34,410
Look, I made a decision.

114
00:12:34,855 --> 00:12:37,972
I had to consider
the integrity of the scene.

115
00:12:38,415 --> 00:12:39,734
Couldn't worry
whether you thought...

116
00:12:40,175 --> 00:12:41,893
you were getting enough time
on the playing field.

117
00:12:42,335 --> 00:12:44,326
Hey, man...

118
00:12:44,775 --> 00:12:46,493
just don't jerk me off.
That's all I ask.

119
00:12:46,935 --> 00:12:48,414
Don't jerk me off.

120
00:12:53,855 --> 00:12:56,494
He's been dead a long time...

121
00:12:56,935 --> 00:12:57,811
and I can tell you
it was not a poison.

122
00:12:58,255 --> 00:12:59,529
Oh, man.

123
00:12:59,975 --> 00:13:01,727
How does someone
let themselves go like that?

124
00:13:02,175 --> 00:13:06,009
It took four orderlies
just to get him on the table.

125
00:13:08,655 --> 00:13:10,213
How'd the fat fuck
ever fit out his front door?

126
00:13:10,655 --> 00:13:12,407
Please.
It's obvious he was a shut-in.

127
00:13:12,855 --> 00:13:15,653
Look at this.
See how big this stomach is?

128
00:13:16,095 --> 00:13:18,689
And the strange thing
is stretches.

129
00:13:19,135 --> 00:13:21,126
Look at the size
of the cardiac orifice...

130
00:13:21,575 --> 00:13:22,371
where the food...

131
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:25,409
I see,
but that means nothing to me.

132
00:13:25,855 --> 00:13:28,289
He's got lines of distension
across the duodenum...

133
00:13:28,735 --> 00:13:31,295
and the interior wall
is ripped open.

134
00:13:31,735 --> 00:13:34,044
This man ate till he burst?

135
00:13:34,495 --> 00:13:37,293
He didn't really burst,
not all the way...

136
00:13:37,735 --> 00:13:39,214
but he was haemorrhaging
internally.

137
00:13:39,655 --> 00:13:41,452
There was a haematoma
in the rectus.

138
00:13:41,895 --> 00:13:44,648
So he did die by eating.

139
00:13:45,095 --> 00:13:46,528
Yes and no.

140
00:13:48,255 --> 00:13:50,132
What about
these bruises up here?

141
00:13:51,535 --> 00:13:53,287
I haven't figured that out yet.

142
00:13:53,735 --> 00:13:55,248
Gun pressed against his head?

143
00:13:55,695 --> 00:13:56,605
Pressed hard enough, sure.

144
00:13:57,055 --> 00:13:57,965
Fuck, yeah.

145
00:13:58,415 --> 00:14:01,691
Marks from the front side
flush with the muzzle.

146
00:14:02,135 --> 00:14:06,333
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have ourselves a homicide.

147
00:14:09,255 --> 00:14:11,450
Killer put a bucket beneath him,
kept on serving.

148
00:14:11,775 --> 00:14:13,254
Took his time, too.

149
00:14:13,695 --> 00:14:15,970
Coroner said this could've
gone on more than twelve hours.

150
00:14:16,415 --> 00:14:19,373
Victim's throat was swollen,
probably from the effort...

151
00:14:19,815 --> 00:14:22,283
and there was definitely a point
when he passed out.

152
00:14:22,735 --> 00:14:24,373
The killer kicked him,
and he burst.

153
00:14:24,815 --> 00:14:26,373
Sadistic fucker, huh?

154
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:29,375
When you want somebody dead,
you drive by and shoot them.

155
00:14:29,815 --> 00:14:31,533
You don't risk the time
it takes to do this...

156
00:14:31,975 --> 00:14:33,852
unless the act itself
has meaning.

157
00:14:34,295 --> 00:14:35,330
Come on.

158
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:37,652
Somebody had a problem
with the fat boy...

159
00:14:38,095 --> 00:14:39,574
and decided to torture him.
Simple as that.

160
00:14:40,015 --> 00:14:42,210
In the grocery bags,
we found two receipts.

161
00:14:42,655 --> 00:14:44,691
That means the killer
stopped in the middle...

162
00:14:45,135 --> 00:14:47,205
and made a second trip
to the supermarket.

163
00:14:47,655 --> 00:14:49,213
So?

164
00:14:49,655 --> 00:14:50,849
Hey, man, it's his thing.

165
00:14:51,295 --> 00:14:52,569
I've been out
in the rain all day.

166
00:14:53,015 --> 00:14:54,528
This is beginning.

167
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:56,408
We've got one dead guy,
not three.

168
00:14:56,855 --> 00:14:57,810
No motive.

169
00:14:58,255 --> 00:15:02,771
Don't start your big brain
cooking on this. Please.

170
00:15:03,215 --> 00:15:05,604
I'd like to be reassigned.

171
00:15:06,055 --> 00:15:09,286
What? What in the hell
are you talking about?

172
00:15:09,735 --> 00:15:11,214
This can't be my last duty.

173
00:15:11,655 --> 00:15:13,213
It's just going to go on and on.

174
00:15:13,655 --> 00:15:14,644
You're retiring.

175
00:15:15,095 --> 00:15:17,245
Six more days
and you're all the way gone.

176
00:15:17,695 --> 00:15:19,845
Won't be the first time
you've left unfinished business.

177
00:15:20,295 --> 00:15:22,763
Those cases were taken as close
to conclusion as possible...

178
00:15:23,215 --> 00:15:24,694
and if I may speak freely...

179
00:15:25,135 --> 00:15:26,011
We're all friends here.

180
00:15:26,455 --> 00:15:27,729
This should not be
his first assignment.

181
00:15:28,175 --> 00:15:29,449
Come on! I knew it.

182
00:15:29,895 --> 00:15:31,806
This is not
my first assignment, dick.

183
00:15:32,255 --> 00:15:33,085
It's too soon for him.

184
00:15:33,535 --> 00:15:36,174
I'm here. You can say
that shit to my face.

185
00:15:36,615 --> 00:15:37,491
It's too soon.

186
00:15:37,935 --> 00:15:40,847
Captain, if we can just talk
in private.

187
00:15:41,295 --> 00:15:42,967
This isn't working.
It's a personal thing.

188
00:15:43,415 --> 00:15:44,734
Shut up, Mills.

189
00:15:45,175 --> 00:15:48,451
I don't have anyone else
to put on this.

190
00:15:48,895 --> 00:15:51,363
This is Metro.
You don't get to swap.

191
00:15:51,815 --> 00:15:53,806
-Give it to me.
-Say what?

192
00:15:54,255 --> 00:15:56,610
He doesn't want it, fuck him.
Sorry. See you later.

193
00:15:57,055 --> 00:15:58,283
Have a nice time.
Give it to me.

194
00:15:58,735 --> 00:16:00,726
No. I'm putting you
on something else.

195
00:16:03,135 --> 00:16:05,330
Go on, Mills. Just go on.

196
00:16:10,735 --> 00:16:12,566
I'm sorry, old buddy...

197
00:16:13,015 --> 00:16:17,486
but it looks like you're stuck
cleaning up the fat man.

198
00:16:32,735 --> 00:16:36,967
All right. Here we go.
Quiet down. Calm down.

199
00:16:37,415 --> 00:16:40,293
Calm down. Quiet down!

200
00:16:42,415 --> 00:16:45,248
Now, here's
how it's going to be...

201
00:16:45,695 --> 00:16:49,051
I'll answer questions
for ten minutes only.

202
00:16:49,495 --> 00:16:50,371
If those questions
do not come...

203
00:16:50,815 --> 00:16:52,646
in a calm, sane,
and orderly fashion...

204
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:54,005
I'm on my way out.

205
00:16:54,455 --> 00:16:55,410
Detective?

206
00:16:55,855 --> 00:16:58,085
Can I have a moment
of your time?

207
00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:05,774
I will not discuss the details
of this ongoing investigation...

208
00:17:06,215 --> 00:17:07,773
so don't bother asking.

209
00:17:12,495 --> 00:17:13,610
There he is.

210
00:17:14,055 --> 00:17:17,491
That's the guy.

211
00:17:17,935 --> 00:17:20,495
It looks like
we won't be eating dinner.

212
00:17:20,935 --> 00:17:23,085
Who is this kid, anyway?
Hotshot.

213
00:17:25,535 --> 00:17:27,366
What have you guys got for me?

214
00:17:27,815 --> 00:17:29,692
Nothing yet, boss.

215
00:17:31,695 --> 00:17:35,688
Why don't you guys
go get a coffee?

216
00:17:36,135 --> 00:17:37,966
We have
this breaking story for you.

217
00:17:38,415 --> 00:17:42,090
We're going live downtown where
defence attorney Eli Gould...

218
00:17:42,535 --> 00:17:43,809
was found murdered this morning.

219
00:17:44,255 --> 00:17:49,045
District Attorney Martin Talbot
is taking questions.

220
00:17:49,495 --> 00:17:50,974
Conflict of interest
between your office...

221
00:17:51,415 --> 00:17:53,406
That is ridiculous
to the point of being offensive.

222
00:17:53,855 --> 00:17:55,447
There is no conflict
whatsoever...

223
00:17:55,895 --> 00:17:58,489
and any claim there could be
is irresponsible.

224
00:17:58,935 --> 00:18:02,166
Is it true you're far from
apprehending a suspect?

225
00:18:02,615 --> 00:18:05,573
I've come from a meeting
of law enforcement officials...

226
00:18:06,015 --> 00:18:10,133
and they've assured me
their very best men are on this.

227
00:18:10,575 --> 00:18:16,013
This will be the very definition
of swift justice.

228
00:18:38,775 --> 00:18:40,606
Pardon me, George.

229
00:18:45,855 --> 00:18:47,004
Come in.

230
00:18:47,455 --> 00:18:48,968
Have you heard the news?

231
00:18:49,415 --> 00:18:50,450
Haven't heard.

232
00:18:50,895 --> 00:18:52,726
Eli Gould was found
murdered this morning.

233
00:18:53,175 --> 00:18:57,532
Someone broke into his law firm
and bled him to death...

234
00:18:57,975 --> 00:19:01,172
wrote the word "Greed"
on the floor.

235
00:19:05,255 --> 00:19:07,849
-Greed?
-In blood.

236
00:19:08,295 --> 00:19:10,206
Mills is heading up
the investigation.

237
00:19:10,655 --> 00:19:12,646
Excuse me.

238
00:19:13,095 --> 00:19:15,325
Could you not do that, please?

239
00:19:17,535 --> 00:19:18,604
Well, good for him.

240
00:19:19,055 --> 00:19:22,092
What in the hell are you
going to do with yourself...

241
00:19:22,535 --> 00:19:24,014
out there, Somerset?

242
00:19:24,455 --> 00:19:28,209
I'll work, maybe on a farm,
fix my house.

243
00:19:28,655 --> 00:19:30,134
Don't you feel that feeling?

244
00:19:30,575 --> 00:19:33,009
You're not going to be
a cop anymore.

245
00:19:33,455 --> 00:19:35,650
That's the whole idea.

246
00:19:37,095 --> 00:19:38,164
I don't think you're leaving.

247
00:19:38,615 --> 00:19:41,049
Hell, you can't leave all this.

248
00:19:43,055 --> 00:19:46,411
A guy's out walking his dog,
gets attacked.

249
00:19:46,855 --> 00:19:49,323
His watch is taken, his wallet.

250
00:19:49,775 --> 00:19:52,972
While he's lying there
on the sidewalk helpless...

251
00:19:53,415 --> 00:19:56,612
his attacker stabs him
in both eyes.

252
00:19:57,055 --> 00:20:00,365
This happened last night
about four blocks from here.

253
00:20:00,815 --> 00:20:02,248
I read about it.

254
00:20:02,695 --> 00:20:04,925
I don't understand
this place any longer.

255
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:06,888
It's the way it's always been.

256
00:20:07,335 --> 00:20:08,404
Maybe you're right.

257
00:20:08,855 --> 00:20:10,811
You do this work,
you were made for it...

258
00:20:11,255 --> 00:20:13,564
and I don't think
you can deny that.

259
00:20:14,015 --> 00:20:15,733
Maybe I'm wrong.

260
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:20,564
The coroner sent
this down for you.

261
00:20:21,015 --> 00:20:24,928
Found them in the fat boy's
stomach mixed with the food.

262
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:26,444
Looks like plastic.

263
00:20:26,895 --> 00:20:28,692
Set them on the desk, please.

264
00:20:32,855 --> 00:20:35,415
They were fed to him.

265
00:22:10,855 --> 00:22:13,289
Oh, Lord.

266
00:22:19,935 --> 00:22:21,971
This was found on the wall
behind the refrigerator...

267
00:22:22,415 --> 00:22:24,167
at the obesity murder scene.

268
00:22:25,815 --> 00:22:26,884
"Long is the way and hard...

269
00:22:27,335 --> 00:22:29,803
"that out of Hell
leads up to light."

270
00:22:30,255 --> 00:22:33,292
It's from Milton.
"Paradise Lost."

271
00:22:33,735 --> 00:22:35,805
All right. I'm confused.

272
00:22:36,255 --> 00:22:38,689
It means that this is beginning.

273
00:22:39,135 --> 00:22:41,774
This was found behind
the same refrigerator...

274
00:22:42,215 --> 00:22:44,046
written in grease.

275
00:22:44,495 --> 00:22:46,372
There are seven deadly sins,
Captain.

276
00:22:46,815 --> 00:22:48,134
Gluttony...

277
00:22:50,455 --> 00:22:51,888
greed...

278
00:22:53,975 --> 00:22:58,253
sloth, wrath, pride, lust...

279
00:22:58,695 --> 00:23:01,163
and envy. Seven.

280
00:23:01,615 --> 00:23:02,491
Hold on.

281
00:23:02,935 --> 00:23:04,891
This is not even my desk.

282
00:23:05,335 --> 00:23:08,247
You can expect
five more of these.

283
00:23:09,855 --> 00:23:11,686
Now wait a minute.

284
00:23:12,135 --> 00:23:14,569
I can't get involved in this.

285
00:23:17,615 --> 00:23:19,207
He wanted it.

286
00:23:20,335 --> 00:23:21,654
Damn.

287
00:23:22,095 --> 00:23:24,290
I'm all over it.

288
00:23:56,615 --> 00:23:58,287
Where you headed?

289
00:24:00,495 --> 00:24:02,690
Far away from here.

290
00:24:11,015 --> 00:24:13,609
Thanks, George.
How you doing?

291
00:24:14,055 --> 00:24:15,932
I've got a few things
to look up.

292
00:24:16,375 --> 00:24:17,854
Sit where you'd like.

293
00:24:18,295 --> 00:24:20,172
How's everybody?

294
00:24:21,215 --> 00:24:22,933
Hi there, Smiley.

295
00:24:23,375 --> 00:24:25,570
Come on, George.
Your cards are getting cold.

296
00:24:26,015 --> 00:24:27,334
Duty calls.

297
00:24:42,295 --> 00:24:45,810
Gentlemen, gentlemen.
I'll never understand.

298
00:24:46,255 --> 00:24:48,849
All these books...

299
00:24:49,295 --> 00:24:51,331
a world of knowledge
at your fingertips.

300
00:24:51,775 --> 00:24:54,767
What do you do?
Play poker all night.

301
00:24:55,215 --> 00:24:57,092
We got culture!

302
00:24:57,535 --> 00:25:00,333
We got culture
coming out our ass.

303
00:25:00,775 --> 00:25:02,925
All right!

304
00:25:03,375 --> 00:25:05,252
How's this for culture?

305
00:27:36,135 --> 00:27:41,209
Smiley,
you really going to miss us.

306
00:27:41,655 --> 00:27:43,486
I just might.

307
00:28:38,775 --> 00:28:40,254
Fucking Dante.

308
00:28:40,695 --> 00:28:45,086
Goddamned poetry-rhyming
faggot piece of shit!

309
00:28:45,535 --> 00:28:47,412
Fucker!

310
00:28:57,375 --> 00:28:59,047
Good work, Officer.

311
00:29:05,375 --> 00:29:07,013
Thank you, Lord.

312
00:29:14,215 --> 00:29:16,126
Sorry.

313
00:29:17,615 --> 00:29:20,448
Be out of your way in a second.

314
00:29:30,575 --> 00:29:32,054
You want your chair?

315
00:29:32,495 --> 00:29:34,804
No. You go right ahead.

316
00:30:11,535 --> 00:30:12,650
Phone.

317
00:30:13,095 --> 00:30:16,451
It's a package deal.
It comes with the office.

318
00:30:22,815 --> 00:30:25,124
Are you OK?
ls something wrong?

319
00:30:25,575 --> 00:30:28,043
You dingleberry.

320
00:30:28,495 --> 00:30:30,690
I told you
not to call me at work.

321
00:30:31,815 --> 00:30:34,204
Yeah. Why? Why?

322
00:30:46,455 --> 00:30:48,923
-It's my wife.
-Sorry?

323
00:30:49,375 --> 00:30:52,048
She'd like to speak to you.

324
00:31:00,895 --> 00:31:03,648
This is Detective Somerset.

325
00:31:04,975 --> 00:31:07,773
Well, it's nice
to talk to you, too.

326
00:31:08,215 --> 00:31:11,844
I appreciate the offer, but...

327
00:31:14,455 --> 00:31:17,015
Well, in that case,
I'd be delighted.

328
00:31:17,455 --> 00:31:20,128
Yes, thank you very much.

329
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:25,534
Hon, what...

330
00:31:32,735 --> 00:31:35,852
-Well?
-Sorry?

331
00:31:36,295 --> 00:31:39,173
I've been invited to
a late supper at your apartment.

332
00:31:39,615 --> 00:31:42,925
-I accepted.
-How's that?

333
00:31:43,375 --> 00:31:44,649
Tonight.

334
00:31:51,335 --> 00:31:52,973
Hello, men.

335
00:31:53,415 --> 00:31:54,734
-Hi, loser.
-Hi, idiot.

336
00:31:57,415 --> 00:32:00,248
This is Tracy.
Tracy, Somerset.

337
00:32:01,815 --> 00:32:05,091
Happy to meet you.
I've heard a lot about you.

338
00:32:05,535 --> 00:32:08,003
Except, of course,
your first name.

339
00:32:08,455 --> 00:32:09,524
It's William.

340
00:32:09,975 --> 00:32:13,809
It's a good name, William.

341
00:32:14,255 --> 00:32:16,132
William,
I'd like you to meet David.

342
00:32:16,575 --> 00:32:17,724
David, this is William.

343
00:32:18,175 --> 00:32:20,643
I'll be right back.
How are the kids?

344
00:32:21,095 --> 00:32:22,244
Good.
They're in their room.

345
00:32:22,695 --> 00:32:24,174
Come on in.

346
00:32:24,615 --> 00:32:27,891
Oh, good dogs!

347
00:32:31,295 --> 00:32:33,126
How are you?

348
00:32:39,815 --> 00:32:41,851
-Smells good.
-What?

349
00:32:42,295 --> 00:32:43,330
The...

350
00:32:43,775 --> 00:32:46,209
Yeah. I mean, thank you.

351
00:32:46,655 --> 00:32:48,566
Please, have a seat.

352
00:32:49,015 --> 00:32:50,164
Would you like something
to drink?

353
00:32:50,615 --> 00:32:52,970
No, thanks. I'll wait.

354
00:32:53,415 --> 00:32:54,325
Just throw that anywhere.

355
00:32:54,775 --> 00:32:58,211
Excuse all this mess.
We're still unpacking.

356
00:33:00,375 --> 00:33:03,014
I understand you two
were high-school sweethearts.

357
00:33:04,455 --> 00:33:06,923
Pretty hokey, huh?

358
00:33:07,375 --> 00:33:08,603
You know something?

359
00:33:09,055 --> 00:33:12,286
I knew on our first date
I was going to marry him.

360
00:33:12,735 --> 00:33:14,293
Really?

361
00:33:15,495 --> 00:33:17,884
He was the funniest guy
I'd ever met.

362
00:33:22,295 --> 00:33:23,444
Really?

363
00:33:25,575 --> 00:33:28,408
Well, it's kind of rare
nowadays, you know...

364
00:33:28,855 --> 00:33:32,006
that level of commitment.

365
00:33:36,575 --> 00:33:37,451
Don't worry.

366
00:33:37,895 --> 00:33:41,649
I won't wear it
to the dinner table.

367
00:33:42,095 --> 00:33:44,655
No matter how often
I see guns...

368
00:33:45,095 --> 00:33:47,609
I can't get used to them.

369
00:33:48,055 --> 00:33:49,966
Same here.

370
00:33:58,655 --> 00:34:01,123
Why aren't you married, William?

371
00:34:01,575 --> 00:34:03,372
Trace. What the hell?

372
00:34:03,815 --> 00:34:07,251
I was close once.
Just didn't happen.

373
00:34:07,695 --> 00:34:09,686
It surprises me.

374
00:34:10,135 --> 00:34:11,853
It really does.

375
00:34:12,295 --> 00:34:17,210
Anyone who spends a significant
amount of time with me...

376
00:34:17,655 --> 00:34:19,691
finds me disagreeable.

377
00:34:20,135 --> 00:34:21,329
Ask your husband.

378
00:34:21,775 --> 00:34:24,448
Very, very true.

379
00:34:25,495 --> 00:34:27,850
So how long have you lived here?

380
00:34:28,295 --> 00:34:30,365
Too long.

381
00:34:33,095 --> 00:34:34,414
How are you liking it?

382
00:34:36,335 --> 00:34:40,453
You know,
takes time to settle in.

383
00:34:40,895 --> 00:34:42,374
It'll be good.

384
00:34:42,815 --> 00:34:45,283
You get numb after a while.

385
00:34:45,735 --> 00:34:47,851
There are things to any city...

386
00:34:53,095 --> 00:34:54,494
The subway.

387
00:34:54,935 --> 00:34:56,414
It'll go away in a minute.

388
00:34:56,855 --> 00:34:58,083
It's nothing.

389
00:35:00,495 --> 00:35:02,486
That real-estate guy.

390
00:35:02,935 --> 00:35:04,846
Fucking piece of...
Sorry, hon.

391
00:35:05,295 --> 00:35:08,207
Shows us the place
a few times.

392
00:35:08,655 --> 00:35:11,294
I think it's good.
Trace likes it.

393
00:35:11,735 --> 00:35:14,249
Then I start wondering
why he only brings us here...

394
00:35:14,695 --> 00:35:16,287
five minutes at a time.

395
00:35:16,735 --> 00:35:18,214
We found out the first night.

396
00:35:18,655 --> 00:35:23,046
The soothing, relaxing,
vibrating home, huh?

397
00:35:31,615 --> 00:35:33,526
I'm sorry.

398
00:35:39,295 --> 00:35:41,684
All right, laugh it up.

399
00:35:43,495 --> 00:35:46,567
I don't know what
you're laughing at.

400
00:35:50,135 --> 00:35:51,966
All right already.

401
00:35:54,455 --> 00:35:57,049
The guy had to get
into the building...

402
00:35:57,415 --> 00:35:59,610
before the office was closed
and security tightened.

403
00:36:00,055 --> 00:36:01,374
Gould would have been
working late.

404
00:36:01,815 --> 00:36:04,727
I'm certain.
Biggest defence lawyer in town.

405
00:36:05,175 --> 00:36:06,085
Infamous, really.

406
00:36:06,535 --> 00:36:08,605
The body was found
Tuesday morning.

407
00:36:09,055 --> 00:36:10,488
The office was closed Monday.

408
00:36:10,935 --> 00:36:12,414
The guy could have
gotten in on Friday...

409
00:36:12,855 --> 00:36:14,129
Iaid low till
the cleaning crew left...

410
00:36:14,575 --> 00:36:18,409
and had his way all day
Saturday, Sunday, maybe Monday.

411
00:36:18,855 --> 00:36:20,049
Look at this.

412
00:36:20,495 --> 00:36:23,248
Gould was bound,
his right arm free.

413
00:36:23,695 --> 00:36:26,209
He was handed
a butcher's knife.

414
00:36:26,655 --> 00:36:28,646
Check out the scale.

415
00:36:29,095 --> 00:36:31,211
A pound of flesh?

416
00:36:36,455 --> 00:36:39,208
"One pound of flesh,
no more, no less.

417
00:36:39,655 --> 00:36:42,613
"No cartilage, no bone,
but only flesh."

418
00:36:43,055 --> 00:36:44,886
-"Merchant of Venice."
-Didn't see it.

419
00:36:45,335 --> 00:36:48,486
"His task done,
then he would go free."

420
00:36:48,935 --> 00:36:51,608
That chair
was soaked with sweat.

421
00:36:52,055 --> 00:36:53,329
Of course.

422
00:36:53,775 --> 00:36:56,573
The killer would have
wanted Gould to take his time...

423
00:36:57,015 --> 00:36:59,973
to sit and decide
which cut to make first.

424
00:37:00,415 --> 00:37:03,134
Imagine it--
there's a gun in your face.

425
00:37:03,575 --> 00:37:05,452
Which part of your body
is expendable?

426
00:37:05,895 --> 00:37:07,647
How about the love handle?

427
00:37:08,095 --> 00:37:11,724
Cut along the side
of his own stomach.

428
00:37:12,175 --> 00:37:15,008
Let's take a fresh look
at these.

429
00:37:15,455 --> 00:37:17,491
Even though the corpse is there,
look through it.

430
00:37:17,935 --> 00:37:19,334
Edit out the initial shock.

431
00:37:19,775 --> 00:37:22,414
The trick is to find
one item, one detail...

432
00:37:22,855 --> 00:37:26,291
and focus on it until
it's an exhausted possibility.

433
00:37:26,735 --> 00:37:28,612
I'm going to get another beer.
Beer?

434
00:37:29,055 --> 00:37:31,330
Wine, please.

435
00:37:38,215 --> 00:37:40,604
He's preaching.

436
00:37:41,055 --> 00:37:43,125
He's punishing.

437
00:37:44,375 --> 00:37:47,447
The sins were used
in medieval sermons.

438
00:37:47,895 --> 00:37:49,248
There were
seven cardinal virtues...

439
00:37:49,695 --> 00:37:51,845
and seven deadly sins
used as teaching tools.

440
00:37:52,295 --> 00:37:55,924
Like in "The Parson's Tale,"
and what's-his...Dante.

441
00:37:56,375 --> 00:37:58,684
-You read them.
-Parts.

442
00:37:59,135 --> 00:38:02,366
Remember in "Purgatory,"
Dante and his buddy...

443
00:38:02,815 --> 00:38:06,171
they're climbing up the hill,
checking out the sinners?

444
00:38:06,615 --> 00:38:08,446
Yeah. The Seven Terraces
of Purgation.

445
00:38:08,895 --> 00:38:12,410
Right, but pride comes first,
not gluttony.

446
00:38:12,855 --> 00:38:17,053
Let's consider that the books
were the inspiration.

447
00:38:17,495 --> 00:38:19,884
The sermons were
about atonement for sin.

448
00:38:20,335 --> 00:38:22,166
These murders
are like forced attrition.

449
00:38:22,615 --> 00:38:24,606
-Forced what?
-Attrition.

450
00:38:25,055 --> 00:38:27,615
When you regret your sins
but not because you love God.

451
00:38:28,055 --> 00:38:31,092
Because someone's sticking
a fucking gun in your face.

452
00:38:34,575 --> 00:38:36,930
No fingerprints.

453
00:38:37,375 --> 00:38:39,889
Totally unrelated victims.

454
00:38:40,335 --> 00:38:42,769
And no witnesses of any kind.

455
00:38:43,215 --> 00:38:47,970
Which I don't get because
the fucker had to get back out.

456
00:38:48,415 --> 00:38:52,408
In any major city, minding
your own business is a science.

457
00:38:52,855 --> 00:38:54,447
First thing they teach women
in rape prevention...

458
00:38:54,895 --> 00:38:56,374
is never cry for help.

459
00:38:56,815 --> 00:39:00,171
Always yell "Fire."
Nobody answers "Help."

460
00:39:00,615 --> 00:39:02,173
Holler "Fire,"
they come running.

461
00:39:02,615 --> 00:39:03,889
That's fucked up.

462
00:39:04,335 --> 00:39:06,803
Must have left
another puzzle piece.

463
00:39:08,535 --> 00:39:11,413
Know what? Thank you
for talking this out...

464
00:39:11,855 --> 00:39:14,210
but I got to sleep,
walk the dogs.

465
00:39:14,655 --> 00:39:16,646
This is to satisfy my curiosity.

466
00:39:17,095 --> 00:39:18,528
I'm still leaving
at the end of the week.

467
00:39:18,975 --> 00:39:20,886
Shit. Wait.

468
00:39:22,415 --> 00:39:25,213
Gould's wife was out of town...

469
00:39:25,655 --> 00:39:26,974
except this means
she saw something.

470
00:39:27,415 --> 00:39:28,404
What if it's a threat?

471
00:39:28,855 --> 00:39:33,212
I put her in a safe house.
She wasn't happy about it.

472
00:39:40,375 --> 00:39:42,445
What if it isn't
something she has seen...

473
00:39:42,895 --> 00:39:44,408
but something
she's supposed to see...

474
00:39:44,855 --> 00:39:46,493
but hasn't been given a chance?

475
00:39:46,935 --> 00:39:50,450
-What?
-I don't know.

476
00:39:52,055 --> 00:39:54,091
But that's the one thing.

477
00:40:37,335 --> 00:40:38,927
Sign us in.

478
00:40:39,255 --> 00:40:41,291
We've got to see Mrs. Gould.

479
00:40:43,815 --> 00:40:46,283
We want you to have
a phone line, but...

480
00:40:46,735 --> 00:40:49,772
Mrs. Gould?

481
00:40:53,655 --> 00:40:56,488
Mrs. Gould, I am sorry.
I truly am.

482
00:40:56,935 --> 00:40:58,971
I don't understand.

483
00:40:59,415 --> 00:41:03,966
I need you to look at each photo
very carefully.

484
00:41:04,415 --> 00:41:08,488
See if there's anything strange
or out of place...

485
00:41:08,935 --> 00:41:09,970
anything at all.

486
00:41:10,415 --> 00:41:12,975
-I don't see anything.
-You sure?

487
00:41:13,415 --> 00:41:15,770
Please, I can't do this
right now!

488
00:41:17,935 --> 00:41:19,209
It's got to be now.

489
00:41:19,655 --> 00:41:22,044
There may be something
we haven't seen.

490
00:41:30,255 --> 00:41:32,325
-Wait.
-What?

491
00:41:32,775 --> 00:41:34,003
Here.

492
00:41:37,055 --> 00:41:39,853
This painting is upside down.

493
00:41:46,695 --> 00:41:48,731
You sure your men
didn't move this?

494
00:41:49,175 --> 00:41:52,406
No. Those shots were taken
before Forensics.

495
00:41:55,095 --> 00:41:56,574
Nothing.

496
00:41:57,015 --> 00:41:59,654
There's got to be something.

497
00:42:09,935 --> 00:42:12,210
Moved the screws to rehang it.

498
00:42:16,295 --> 00:42:18,126
What the fuck is that?

499
00:42:19,215 --> 00:42:21,012
Switchblade.

500
00:42:28,695 --> 00:42:30,686
God damn it!

501
00:42:33,535 --> 00:42:35,765
Must be something.

502
00:42:40,295 --> 00:42:42,934
He didn't paint
the fucking thing.

503
00:42:50,735 --> 00:42:54,125
Now he's fucking with us.
That's what he's doing.

504
00:42:54,575 --> 00:42:56,725
See this? This is us.

505
00:42:58,015 --> 00:42:59,926
Just wait a minute.

506
00:43:02,655 --> 00:43:04,088
Now Somerset's
climbing on the furniture.

507
00:43:04,535 --> 00:43:06,093
Just wait a minute.

508
00:43:11,215 --> 00:43:12,534
You're kidding me.

509
00:43:12,975 --> 00:43:15,569
Call the print lab.

510
00:43:19,695 --> 00:43:22,129
Oh, man.

511
00:43:24,655 --> 00:43:28,648
Honestly, have you ever
seen anything like this?

512
00:43:32,535 --> 00:43:36,369
I can tell you just by looking
at the swirl pattern...

513
00:43:36,815 --> 00:43:39,045
they're not
the victim's fingerprints.

514
00:43:48,895 --> 00:43:50,567
I don't know, man.

515
00:43:51,015 --> 00:43:53,131
I'd say he's whacked enough.

516
00:43:54,775 --> 00:43:55,525
Doesn't fit.

517
00:43:55,975 --> 00:43:57,408
He doesn't want us
to help him stop.

518
00:43:57,855 --> 00:43:58,970
Who knows?

519
00:43:59,415 --> 00:44:03,090
Freaks doing evil deeds
they don't want to do.

520
00:44:03,535 --> 00:44:05,526
"Voices made me do it.
My dog made me do it.

521
00:44:05,975 --> 00:44:07,454
"Jodie Foster
told me to do it."

522
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:11,604
I've seen this take
three days to make a match...

523
00:44:12,055 --> 00:44:15,730
so maybe you want to cross
your fingers somewhere else.

524
00:44:18,535 --> 00:44:21,003
You meant what you said
to Mrs. Gould...

525
00:44:21,455 --> 00:44:22,934
about catching this guy?

526
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:29,373
I wish I still thought
the way you do.

527
00:44:29,815 --> 00:44:31,214
Why don't you tell me...

528
00:44:31,655 --> 00:44:33,930
what the hell it is
you think we're doing?

529
00:44:34,375 --> 00:44:36,331
Picking up the pieces.

530
00:44:37,575 --> 00:44:39,008
We're collecting
all the evidence...

531
00:44:39,455 --> 00:44:42,128
taking all the pictures
and samples...

532
00:44:42,575 --> 00:44:44,372
writing everything down...

533
00:44:44,815 --> 00:44:46,646
noting the time things happen.

534
00:44:48,095 --> 00:44:48,766
That's all?

535
00:44:49,215 --> 00:44:50,284
That's all.

536
00:44:50,735 --> 00:44:52,612
Putting everything
into neat little piles...

537
00:44:53,055 --> 00:44:56,047
and filing it away
on the off chance...

538
00:44:56,495 --> 00:44:59,009
it will ever be needed
in the courtroom.

539
00:45:01,095 --> 00:45:03,893
Picking up diamonds
on a deserted island...

540
00:45:04,335 --> 00:45:07,611
saving them
in case we get rescued.

541
00:45:10,095 --> 00:45:11,448
Bullshit.

542
00:45:13,295 --> 00:45:17,846
Even the most promising clues
usually only lead to others.

543
00:45:19,255 --> 00:45:22,565
So many corpses
roll away unrevenged.

544
00:45:25,335 --> 00:45:29,123
Don't tell me you didn't get
that rush tonight.

545
00:45:29,575 --> 00:45:30,974
I saw you.

546
00:45:32,055 --> 00:45:33,773
We're getting somewhere.

547
00:45:48,055 --> 00:45:49,966
Wake up, Glimmer Twins.

548
00:45:50,415 --> 00:45:52,531
You've got a winner.

549
00:45:58,215 --> 00:45:59,807
This guy goes by the name
of Victor.

550
00:46:00,255 --> 00:46:01,483
His real name is Theodore Allen.

551
00:46:01,935 --> 00:46:04,130
His prints were found
by Homicide.

552
00:46:04,575 --> 00:46:07,692
He's got a long history
of serious mental illness.

553
00:46:08,135 --> 00:46:10,365
His parents gave him a strict
Southern Baptist upbringing...

554
00:46:10,815 --> 00:46:13,693
but somewhere they fell short.

555
00:46:14,135 --> 00:46:16,524
Victor dabbled in drugs,
armed robbery, assault...

556
00:46:16,975 --> 00:46:20,251
spent time in prison here
for attempted rape of a minor...

557
00:46:20,695 --> 00:46:22,811
but his lawyer saw to it
that didn't last long.

558
00:46:23,255 --> 00:46:27,134
His lawyer is Eli Gould,
the Greed murder victim.

559
00:46:27,575 --> 00:46:29,247
We're going to finish
this today.

560
00:46:29,695 --> 00:46:31,094
Victor's been
out of circulation...

561
00:46:31,535 --> 00:46:33,844
but there's still
a residence in his name.

562
00:46:34,295 --> 00:46:36,251
You're not buying all this,
are you?

563
00:46:36,695 --> 00:46:39,892
-Doesn't seem like our guy.
-You tell me.

564
00:46:40,335 --> 00:46:42,565
Our killer seems
to have more purpose.

565
00:47:09,535 --> 00:47:11,253
You ever take a bullet?

566
00:47:11,695 --> 00:47:14,926
Never in my thirty-four years,
knock wood.

567
00:47:15,375 --> 00:47:17,445
I've only taken my gun out
three times...

568
00:47:17,895 --> 00:47:19,772
with the intention of using it.

569
00:47:20,215 --> 00:47:24,288
Never pulled the trigger.
Not once. You?

570
00:47:24,735 --> 00:47:27,454
Yeah, but--
No, I never took a bullet...

571
00:47:27,895 --> 00:47:30,773
but I pulled my gun once,
shot it once.

572
00:47:31,215 --> 00:47:32,091
Really?

573
00:47:32,535 --> 00:47:35,095
It was my first one of these.
Secondary unit.

574
00:47:35,535 --> 00:47:38,049
I was shaky going in.
I was a rookie.

575
00:47:38,495 --> 00:47:41,168
We bust open the door
looking for this junkie...

576
00:47:41,615 --> 00:47:43,014
and the fucker opened fire.

577
00:47:43,455 --> 00:47:46,367
One cop got hit in the arm.

578
00:47:48,095 --> 00:47:50,484
Christ, what was his name?

579
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:53,093
Spun him like a top.

580
00:47:53,535 --> 00:47:55,332
I mean, more like slow motion.

581
00:47:55,775 --> 00:48:01,213
I remember
riding in that ambulance.

582
00:48:01,655 --> 00:48:04,169
Well, he died right there.

583
00:48:04,615 --> 00:48:06,094
Right there.

584
00:48:06,535 --> 00:48:09,208
Christ,
what was his fucking name?

585
00:49:23,575 --> 00:49:27,488
SWAT goes before dicks.
Here.

586
00:49:29,455 --> 00:49:31,525
They love this.

587
00:49:31,975 --> 00:49:33,294
Police!

588
00:49:35,015 --> 00:49:36,494
Clear!

589
00:50:02,695 --> 00:50:04,333
Good morning, sweetheart.

590
00:50:05,535 --> 00:50:06,809
Get up now, motherfucker.

591
00:50:07,255 --> 00:50:08,483
Now!

592
00:50:16,655 --> 00:50:19,123
Get up, you sack of shit.

593
00:50:25,495 --> 00:50:27,804
Fuck me. Dicks!

594
00:50:28,255 --> 00:50:31,088
You want to come
take a look at this!

595
00:50:33,975 --> 00:50:35,533
Dicks!

596
00:50:41,975 --> 00:50:44,125
Jesus. Victor?

597
00:50:44,575 --> 00:50:46,213
That's just Victor.

598
00:50:46,655 --> 00:50:49,408
-Call an ambulance.
-A hearse, more like it.

599
00:50:49,855 --> 00:50:52,892
Get your people out of here.

600
00:50:53,335 --> 00:50:55,007
No one touches anything!

601
00:50:55,455 --> 00:50:57,047
Some kind of freaking
wax sculpture or something.

602
00:51:00,215 --> 00:51:02,126
"Sloth."

603
00:51:11,375 --> 00:51:13,491
Oh, man. God damn.

604
00:51:13,935 --> 00:51:17,371
This picture
was dated three days ago.

605
00:51:23,855 --> 00:51:26,528
This must be
the first one. Look.

606
00:51:26,975 --> 00:51:30,126
It's dated exactly
one year ago today.

607
00:51:32,095 --> 00:51:35,371
I got a hair sample,
a stool sample, piss.

608
00:51:35,815 --> 00:51:37,931
I got fingernails.

609
00:51:39,615 --> 00:51:40,525
He's laughing at us.

610
00:51:40,975 --> 00:51:43,614
You got what you deserved.

611
00:51:46,135 --> 00:51:48,091
He's alive! He's alive!

612
00:51:48,535 --> 00:51:50,207
That cocksucker's alive!

613
00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:55,046
Calm down!
Emergency on that ambulance!

614
00:52:08,935 --> 00:52:12,132
-He's playing games.
-No shit.

615
00:52:13,335 --> 00:52:16,054
We have to divorce ourselves
from emotion.

616
00:52:16,495 --> 00:52:18,884
We have to remain focused
on the details.

617
00:52:19,335 --> 00:52:21,053
Man, I feed off my emotions.

618
00:52:21,495 --> 00:52:23,963
-Are you listening?
-I hear you.

619
00:52:24,415 --> 00:52:25,291
Excuse me.

620
00:52:25,735 --> 00:52:28,044
Closed crime scene.
Get the fuck out.

621
00:52:28,495 --> 00:52:29,610
I got a right.

622
00:52:30,055 --> 00:52:34,014
Get out of here,
piece of shit!

623
00:52:34,455 --> 00:52:36,252
I got your picture, man.

624
00:52:36,695 --> 00:52:40,813
Detective Mills.
M-i-l-l-s! Fuck off!

625
00:52:41,255 --> 00:52:43,086
-I'm surprised you can spell.
-Fuck you!

626
00:52:43,535 --> 00:52:46,254
How do they get here
so fucking quick?

627
00:52:46,695 --> 00:52:49,892
They pay police for
the information and pay well.

628
00:52:50,335 --> 00:52:53,133
Hey, man, I'm sorry.

629
00:52:54,375 --> 00:52:55,603
Well, he pissed me off.

630
00:52:56,055 --> 00:53:01,254
It's impressive to see a man
feeding off his emotions.

631
00:53:06,455 --> 00:53:08,093
A year of immobility
seems about right...

632
00:53:08,535 --> 00:53:11,607
judging by the deterioration
of the spine muscles.

633
00:53:12,055 --> 00:53:14,933
Blood tests show many drugs
in his system...

634
00:53:15,375 --> 00:53:20,449
even an antibiotic to keep
bedsores from infecting.

635
00:53:20,895 --> 00:53:24,285
Has he tried to speak
or communicate in any way?

636
00:53:24,735 --> 00:53:27,295
Even if his brain
were not mush...

637
00:53:27,735 --> 00:53:30,169
he chewed off
his own tongue long ago.

638
00:53:31,735 --> 00:53:33,327
Doctor...

639
00:53:34,535 --> 00:53:37,003
is there absolutely no chance
he might survive?

640
00:53:37,455 --> 00:53:39,491
Detective,
he'd die of shock right now...

641
00:53:39,935 --> 00:53:42,369
if you shined
a flashlight in his eyes.

642
00:53:42,815 --> 00:53:45,249
He's experienced about
as much pain and suffering...

643
00:53:45,695 --> 00:53:48,448
as anyone I've encountered,
give or take...

644
00:53:48,895 --> 00:53:51,568
and he still has Hell
to look forward to.

645
00:53:52,015 --> 00:53:53,130
Good night.

646
00:54:05,695 --> 00:54:09,131
Hello, William?
It's Tracy.

647
00:54:09,575 --> 00:54:12,089
Is everything all right?

648
00:54:12,535 --> 00:54:14,844
Yes, everything's fine.

649
00:54:15,295 --> 00:54:16,045
Where's David?

650
00:54:16,495 --> 00:54:19,134
He's in the other room
in the shower.

651
00:54:19,575 --> 00:54:22,214
I'm sorry to call you like this.

652
00:54:22,655 --> 00:54:26,648
It's all right.
What can I do for you?

653
00:54:27,855 --> 00:54:28,970
I...

654
00:54:30,295 --> 00:54:33,731
I need someone to talk to.

655
00:54:34,175 --> 00:54:36,484
Do you think
you could meet me...

656
00:54:36,935 --> 00:54:38,766
somewhere
maybe tomorrow morning?

657
00:54:39,215 --> 00:54:41,649
I don't understand.

658
00:54:42,895 --> 00:54:46,092
I feel stupid calling...

659
00:54:46,535 --> 00:54:49,333
but you're the only person
that I know here.

660
00:54:49,775 --> 00:54:51,288
There's no one else.

661
00:54:51,735 --> 00:54:55,887
If you can,
just give me a call.

662
00:54:56,335 --> 00:54:57,563
I have to go now.

663
00:54:58,015 --> 00:54:58,891
Good night.

664
00:54:59,335 --> 00:55:00,848
Good night.

665
00:55:17,855 --> 00:55:20,494
It can be a hard place.

666
00:55:20,935 --> 00:55:23,927
I don't know
why I asked you to come.

667
00:55:24,375 --> 00:55:26,730
Why don't you talk to him
about it?

668
00:55:27,175 --> 00:55:28,608
Tell him how you feel.

669
00:55:29,055 --> 00:55:32,411
I can't be a burden...

670
00:55:32,855 --> 00:55:34,129
especially now.

671
00:55:36,375 --> 00:55:39,173
I'll get used to things.

672
00:55:39,615 --> 00:55:42,846
I think I just wanted to talk
to someone who's lived here...

673
00:55:43,295 --> 00:55:44,933
for a long time.

674
00:55:45,375 --> 00:55:46,251
I mean, upstate...

675
00:55:46,695 --> 00:55:50,768
it's a completely
different environment.

676
00:55:52,255 --> 00:55:52,971
Really.

677
00:55:53,415 --> 00:55:56,293
Did David tell you
that I teach fifth grade?

678
00:55:56,735 --> 00:55:57,963
Well, I did.

679
00:55:59,055 --> 00:56:01,649
He mentioned it.

680
00:56:04,455 --> 00:56:07,527
I'm going around,
looking at schools...

681
00:56:09,535 --> 00:56:12,925
but the conditions here
are horrible.

682
00:56:14,735 --> 00:56:16,612
What about private schools?

683
00:56:18,735 --> 00:56:19,884
I don't know.

684
00:56:21,415 --> 00:56:24,168
Why don't you tell me
what's really bothering you?

685
00:56:26,575 --> 00:56:29,647
David and I
are going to have a baby.

686
00:56:36,255 --> 00:56:40,567
I don't think I'm the one
to talk to about this.

687
00:56:41,015 --> 00:56:42,494
I hate this city.

688
00:56:46,375 --> 00:56:49,128
I had a relationship once.

689
00:56:49,575 --> 00:56:51,725
It was very much
like a marriage.

690
00:56:54,575 --> 00:56:56,247
We got pregnant.

691
00:56:57,295 --> 00:56:59,286
This was a long time ago.

692
00:57:04,615 --> 00:57:07,687
I remember getting up
one morning and going to work...

693
00:57:09,495 --> 00:57:11,008
just another day
like any other...

694
00:57:11,455 --> 00:57:12,888
except it was the first day...

695
00:57:13,335 --> 00:57:15,451
after I knew
about the pregnancy.

696
00:57:17,055 --> 00:57:21,810
And I felt this fear
for the first time ever.

697
00:57:24,175 --> 00:57:25,927
I remember thinking...

698
00:57:26,375 --> 00:57:28,730
how can I bring a child
into a world like this?

699
00:57:29,175 --> 00:57:32,565
How can a person grow up
with all this around them?

700
00:57:39,535 --> 00:57:42,413
I told her I didn't
want to have it...

701
00:57:43,895 --> 00:57:49,606
And over the next few weeks,
I wore her down.

702
00:57:51,615 --> 00:57:53,731
I want to have children.

703
00:57:57,815 --> 00:58:00,170
I can tell you now...

704
00:58:00,615 --> 00:58:03,334
I know--I mean...

705
00:58:04,575 --> 00:58:08,363
I'm positive I made
the right decision...

706
00:58:08,815 --> 00:58:10,771
but there's not a day
that passes...

707
00:58:11,215 --> 00:58:14,924
that I don't wish
I'd made a different choice.

708
00:58:18,455 --> 00:58:20,923
If you don't keep...

709
00:58:22,095 --> 00:58:23,369
the baby...

710
00:58:23,815 --> 00:58:25,328
if that's your decision...

711
00:58:27,175 --> 00:58:29,735
don't ever tell him
you were pregnant.

712
00:58:31,095 --> 00:58:34,292
But if you choose
to have this baby...

713
00:58:34,735 --> 00:58:37,693
you spoil that kid
every chance you get.

714
00:58:44,455 --> 00:58:48,733
That's about all the advice
I can give you.

715
00:58:55,695 --> 00:58:56,923
I got to go.

716
00:59:05,775 --> 00:59:07,174
Thank you.

717
00:59:20,175 --> 00:59:24,009
Victor's landlord said cash
was in the office mailbox...

718
00:59:24,455 --> 00:59:26,286
the first of every month.

719
00:59:30,735 --> 00:59:33,203
"I never heard
a single complaint...

720
00:59:33,655 --> 00:59:35,407
"from the tenant
in apartment 306...

721
00:59:35,855 --> 00:59:37,925
"and nobody ever
complained about him.

722
00:59:38,375 --> 00:59:40,843
"He was the best tenant
I've ever had."

723
00:59:41,295 --> 00:59:42,523
A landlord's dream...

724
00:59:42,975 --> 00:59:44,454
a paralysed tenant
with no tongue.

725
00:59:44,895 --> 00:59:47,090
Who pays the rent on time.

726
00:59:47,535 --> 00:59:48,763
I'm sick of all this waiting.

727
00:59:49,215 --> 00:59:50,967
This is the job.

728
00:59:51,415 --> 00:59:52,894
Why aren't we out there?

729
00:59:53,335 --> 00:59:57,692
Why sit here rotting
till the lunatic does it again?

730
00:59:58,135 --> 00:59:59,488
It's dismissive
to call him a lunatic.

731
00:59:59,935 --> 01:00:00,685
Don't make that mistake.

732
01:00:01,135 --> 01:00:03,410
He's insane. Look.

733
01:00:03,855 --> 01:00:07,325
He's probably dancing around
in his grandma's panties...

734
01:00:07,775 --> 01:00:10,573
rubbing himself
in peanut butter.

735
01:00:11,015 --> 01:00:11,686
How's that?

736
01:00:12,135 --> 01:00:13,454
I don't think so.

737
01:00:14,815 --> 01:00:16,851
His luck will run out.

738
01:00:17,295 --> 01:00:19,251
He's not depending on luck.

739
01:00:22,495 --> 01:00:24,725
We walked into that apartment
exactly one year...

740
01:00:25,175 --> 01:00:27,814
after he tied Victor to the bed.

741
01:00:28,255 --> 01:00:28,971
He wanted us to.

742
01:00:29,415 --> 01:00:30,609
You don't know that for sure.

743
01:00:31,055 --> 01:00:32,613
Yes, we do.

744
01:00:33,055 --> 01:00:36,650
This note he left,
his first words to us.

745
01:00:37,095 --> 01:00:38,244
"Long is the way and hard...

746
01:00:38,695 --> 01:00:42,165
"that out of Hell
leads up to light."

747
01:00:42,615 --> 01:00:44,173
Fuck him. So what?

748
01:00:44,615 --> 01:00:46,048
He's right so far.

749
01:00:46,495 --> 01:00:47,610
Imagine the will it takes...

750
01:00:48,055 --> 01:00:50,888
to keep a man bound
for a full year...

751
01:00:51,335 --> 01:00:54,725
to sever his hand and use it
to plant fingerprints...

752
01:00:55,175 --> 01:00:57,405
to insert tubes
into his genitals.

753
01:00:57,855 --> 01:01:00,323
This guy's methodical,
exacting...

754
01:01:00,775 --> 01:01:02,288
and worst of all, patient.

755
01:01:02,735 --> 01:01:03,804
He's a nut-bag.

756
01:01:04,255 --> 01:01:06,485
Just because the fucker's
got a library card...

757
01:01:06,935 --> 01:01:08,414
doesn't make him Yoda.

758
01:01:12,455 --> 01:01:13,729
How much money you got?

759
01:01:14,175 --> 01:01:16,006
I got fifty bucks.

760
01:01:16,455 --> 01:01:18,889
I propose a field trip.
Come on.

761
01:01:21,575 --> 01:01:22,485
We'll make a list.

762
01:01:22,935 --> 01:01:25,688
We'll put "Purgatory,"
"Canterbury Tales..."

763
01:01:26,135 --> 01:01:28,569
anything relating to
the Seven Deadly Sins.

764
01:01:29,015 --> 01:01:33,372
What would he study
to do the things he's done?

765
01:01:33,815 --> 01:01:36,807
What are his interests now?
Jack the Ripper?

766
01:01:37,255 --> 01:01:39,644
-Where are we going?
-The library.

767
01:01:53,135 --> 01:01:54,807
Coupons. Free coupons.

768
01:01:55,255 --> 01:01:57,132
Discount coupons.

769
01:01:57,575 --> 01:02:00,692
They must have had
fifty health violations...

770
01:02:01,135 --> 01:02:02,204
during their last inspection.

771
01:02:02,655 --> 01:02:04,691
Could you at least
sit across from me?

772
01:02:05,135 --> 01:02:07,330
I don't want people
thinking we're dating.

773
01:02:07,775 --> 01:02:09,447
Give me your money.

774
01:02:09,895 --> 01:02:11,169
I'm giving you this...

775
01:02:11,615 --> 01:02:14,527
but I ought to know
what we're doing.

776
01:02:17,135 --> 01:02:18,045
Fuck.

777
01:02:18,495 --> 01:02:20,850
Hey, Somerset.
How are you?

778
01:02:21,295 --> 01:02:23,411
I didn't expect
a mnage  trois.

779
01:02:23,855 --> 01:02:26,164
It's not a problem.
Sit down.

780
01:02:30,215 --> 01:02:32,490
Only for you do I do this.

781
01:02:32,935 --> 01:02:36,450
It's a big risk.
We're fair and square.

782
01:02:36,895 --> 01:02:39,011
-It's a deal.
-All right.

783
01:02:42,415 --> 01:02:43,768
About an hour.

784
01:02:46,135 --> 01:02:47,454
Help yourself.

785
01:02:49,775 --> 01:02:52,892
That was money well spent.

786
01:03:01,655 --> 01:03:04,294
All right.
By telling you this...

787
01:03:04,735 --> 01:03:06,612
I'm trusting you
more than most people.

788
01:03:07,055 --> 01:03:09,808
Good, because I'm about
ready to punch you.

789
01:03:10,255 --> 01:03:11,404
It's probably nothing...

790
01:03:11,855 --> 01:03:15,086
but it's no skin
off our teeth.

791
01:03:16,815 --> 01:03:20,444
The guy in the pizza parlour
is a friend from the Bureau.

792
01:03:22,015 --> 01:03:23,004
Who? Stinky Man?

793
01:03:23,455 --> 01:03:27,050
For years, the FBI has been
into the library system...

794
01:03:27,495 --> 01:03:28,644
keeping records.

795
01:03:29,095 --> 01:03:32,167
-Assessing fines.
-Monitoring reading habits.

796
01:03:32,615 --> 01:03:35,368
Look, certain books are flagged.

797
01:03:35,815 --> 01:03:40,172
Say, nuclear weapons
or "Mein Kampf."

798
01:03:40,615 --> 01:03:42,048
Anyone who checks out
a flagged book...

799
01:03:42,495 --> 01:03:45,328
has his library records
fed into FBI computers.

800
01:03:45,775 --> 01:03:47,254
Wait. How is this legal?

801
01:03:47,695 --> 01:03:50,129
Legal, illegal--
these terms don't apply.

802
01:03:51,535 --> 01:03:53,571
You can't use
the information directly.

803
01:03:54,015 --> 01:03:55,494
It's just a useful guide.

804
01:03:55,935 --> 01:03:58,403
It might sound silly, but you
can't get a library card...

805
01:03:58,855 --> 01:04:02,245
without an l.D.
and a phone bill.

806
01:04:04,135 --> 01:04:05,568
-So they run a list.
-Precisely.

807
01:04:06,015 --> 01:04:08,370
If you want to know
who's reading "Purgatory"...

808
01:04:08,815 --> 01:04:11,283
and "Paradise Lost"
and "Helter Skelter"...

809
01:04:11,735 --> 01:04:13,646
the FBl's computers
will tell us.

810
01:04:14,095 --> 01:04:15,494
Could give us a name.

811
01:04:15,935 --> 01:04:17,971
It could get a college kid...

812
01:04:18,415 --> 01:04:20,724
writing a term paper
on Twentieth-Century crime.

813
01:04:21,175 --> 01:04:23,609
At least you're
out of the office.

814
01:04:24,055 --> 01:04:25,647
Get a haircut.

815
01:04:26,095 --> 01:04:28,211
-How do you know all this?
-I don't.

816
01:04:28,655 --> 01:04:30,008
Neither do you.

817
01:04:30,455 --> 01:04:31,729
Exactly.

818
01:04:39,295 --> 01:04:42,651
"The Divine Comedy,"
"The History of Catholicism."

819
01:04:42,935 --> 01:04:45,369
There's a book called
"Murderers and Madmen."

820
01:04:45,815 --> 01:04:48,966
"Modern Homicide lnvestigation,"
"In Cold Blood..."

821
01:04:49,415 --> 01:04:51,087
"Of Human Bondage." Bondage?

822
01:04:51,535 --> 01:04:53,048
Not what you're thinking.

823
01:04:53,495 --> 01:04:56,726
-Marquis de Sharday.
-Marquis de Sade.

824
01:04:57,175 --> 01:05:00,133
Whatever. Writings of
St. Thomas Aqua-something.

825
01:05:00,575 --> 01:05:02,167
Saint Thomas Aquinas.

826
01:05:02,615 --> 01:05:04,526
He wrote about
the Seven Deadly Sins.

827
01:05:04,975 --> 01:05:06,408
Is that it?

828
01:05:08,255 --> 01:05:09,324
Let's try it.

829
01:05:09,775 --> 01:05:12,289
-Jonathan Doe?
-Whatever.

830
01:05:12,735 --> 01:05:14,771
We're sure about that name?

831
01:05:15,775 --> 01:05:17,811
You saw the list. John Doe.

832
01:05:18,255 --> 01:05:20,325
You wanna go back,
I'll go back.

833
01:05:20,775 --> 01:05:22,493
Let's take a look at him.
Talk to him.

834
01:05:22,935 --> 01:05:24,766
This is crazy.

835
01:05:25,215 --> 01:05:27,171
We'll just talk to him.

836
01:05:27,615 --> 01:05:28,570
Excuse me, sir.

837
01:05:29,015 --> 01:05:31,449
Are you, by any chance,
a serial killer?

838
01:05:34,335 --> 01:05:35,688
You do the talking.

839
01:05:37,095 --> 01:05:38,687
Put that silver tongue to work.

840
01:05:39,135 --> 01:05:41,012
Have you been talking
to my wife?

841
01:05:44,295 --> 01:05:46,172
This is retarded.

842
01:05:46,615 --> 01:05:47,843
Charlie's fucking Angels.

843
01:05:48,295 --> 01:05:50,570
Name off a computer.

844
01:06:05,455 --> 01:06:06,729
You're hit.

845
01:06:10,775 --> 01:06:12,333
He's going down!

846
01:06:28,455 --> 01:06:29,968
Fifth floor!

847
01:06:33,255 --> 01:06:37,168
Mommy! Mommy!

848
01:06:49,375 --> 01:06:51,252
Police.
Is there a back exit?

849
01:06:51,695 --> 01:06:53,048
Lock your door.

850
01:06:54,095 --> 01:06:55,164
What's going on?

851
01:06:55,615 --> 01:06:58,652
Get out of
the fucking hall, please.

852
01:07:22,775 --> 01:07:24,003
Get down!

853
01:07:26,015 --> 01:07:27,334
Get the fuck down!

854
01:07:59,671 --> 01:08:00,945
Shit.

855
01:08:02,431 --> 01:08:04,899
Shut the fuck up down there!

856
01:09:00,431 --> 01:09:01,659
God damn it!

857
01:09:11,711 --> 01:09:13,064
Fuck.

858
01:09:33,591 --> 01:09:35,263
Taxi!

859
01:10:01,631 --> 01:10:04,350
Get out of
the fucking way! Move!

860
01:11:30,151 --> 01:11:32,187
-Are you OK?
-I'm all right.

861
01:11:39,631 --> 01:11:41,986
-Where are you going?
-I'm going in.

862
01:11:42,431 --> 01:11:44,899
Wait, wait, wait.

863
01:11:45,351 --> 01:11:48,423
What are you talking about?
He fucking shot at us.

864
01:11:48,871 --> 01:11:52,341
-We need a warrant.
-Probable cause.

865
01:11:52,791 --> 01:11:55,430
How did we get here?
I can't tell anyone.

866
01:11:55,871 --> 01:11:57,384
I can't tell about the Bureau.

867
01:11:57,831 --> 01:12:00,709
We have no reason to be here.

868
01:12:01,151 --> 01:12:03,585
-Listen to me!
-Get the fuck off me!

869
01:12:04,031 --> 01:12:06,670
I'm sorry,
but just pay attention.

870
01:12:07,111 --> 01:12:10,706
If we leave a hole like this,
we can't prosecute.

871
01:12:11,151 --> 01:12:13,745
The guy will walk.
Is that what you want?

872
01:12:14,191 --> 01:12:17,228
By the time we get the warrant--
Fuck that! No!

873
01:12:17,671 --> 01:12:20,469
We need a reason
to knock on this door!

874
01:12:20,911 --> 01:12:22,469
Think about it!

875
01:12:29,151 --> 01:12:31,619
You're right.
I'm all fucked up.

876
01:12:32,071 --> 01:12:33,345
You're right.

877
01:12:42,071 --> 01:12:43,140
Well...

878
01:12:43,591 --> 01:12:45,388
No point in arguing anymore...

879
01:12:46,791 --> 01:12:48,543
unless you can fix that.

880
01:12:50,311 --> 01:12:52,506
You stupid son of a...

881
01:13:00,231 --> 01:13:02,540
How much money we got left?

882
01:13:02,991 --> 01:13:05,459
So, I noticed this guy...

883
01:13:05,911 --> 01:13:08,425
going out a lot when the murders
was happening...

884
01:13:08,871 --> 01:13:09,940
so l...

885
01:13:10,391 --> 01:13:12,302
You called
Detective Somerset, right?

886
01:13:12,751 --> 01:13:14,309
Right, so I called
the detective...

887
01:13:14,751 --> 01:13:16,662
'cause he looked
creepy and shit.

888
01:13:17,111 --> 01:13:19,579
And one of the murders
happened right over there.

889
01:13:20,031 --> 01:13:22,829
OK. I told you the rest.

890
01:13:23,271 --> 01:13:24,989
You got to sign it.

891
01:13:25,431 --> 01:13:26,944
Good, good, good.

892
01:13:27,391 --> 01:13:28,426
All right.

893
01:13:28,871 --> 01:13:30,589
-You did good.
-I did what you said.

894
01:13:31,031 --> 01:13:33,864
Here.
You get something to eat.

895
01:13:37,671 --> 01:13:39,184
Everybody stay outside.

896
01:14:38,311 --> 01:14:39,869
Victor.

897
01:16:27,991 --> 01:16:29,310
Fuck.

898
01:16:57,151 --> 01:16:59,585
-What?
-We had him.

899
01:17:00,031 --> 01:17:01,510
What are you talking about?

900
01:17:01,951 --> 01:17:05,341
It was the fucking photographer
on the stairs.

901
01:17:09,511 --> 01:17:11,786
We had him,
and we let him go.

902
01:17:18,031 --> 01:17:19,669
You're sure this is him?

903
01:17:20,111 --> 01:17:22,545
Yeah. Good, good.

904
01:17:22,991 --> 01:17:24,788
We've got nothing to go on.

905
01:17:25,231 --> 01:17:27,267
No address books.
Just this receipt.

906
01:17:27,711 --> 01:17:29,030
Then keep looking.

907
01:17:29,471 --> 01:17:31,826
This was under the bed--
his only source of funds.

908
01:17:32,271 --> 01:17:34,785
We got his money.
Fucking-A. Good work.

909
01:17:35,231 --> 01:17:37,062
One more thing
you won't believe.

910
01:17:37,511 --> 01:17:39,502
We haven't found
a fingerprint, not one.

911
01:17:39,951 --> 01:17:42,863
I don't believe you.
Keep looking.

912
01:17:46,871 --> 01:17:48,350
We could use some more men.

913
01:17:48,791 --> 01:17:51,828
I'm doing the best I can.
What's all this?

914
01:17:52,271 --> 01:17:54,102
There are 2,000 notebooks
on these shelves.

915
01:17:54,551 --> 01:17:56,906
Each contains about 250 pages.

916
01:17:57,351 --> 01:17:59,740
Forget it.
Anything about the killings?

917
01:18:00,191 --> 01:18:01,670
"What sick, ridiculous,
puppets we are.

918
01:18:02,111 --> 01:18:03,988
"What a gross little stage
we dance on.

919
01:18:04,431 --> 01:18:06,069
"What fun we have
dancing, fucking...

920
01:18:06,511 --> 01:18:07,990
"not a care in the world...

921
01:18:08,431 --> 01:18:09,625
"not knowing
that we are nothing.

922
01:18:10,071 --> 01:18:11,470
"We are not what was intended."

923
01:18:11,911 --> 01:18:15,187
No, wait.
There's a lot more.

924
01:18:15,631 --> 01:18:16,347
"On the subway today...

925
01:18:16,791 --> 01:18:18,702
"a man started
a conversation with me.

926
01:18:19,151 --> 01:18:20,027
"He made small talk...

927
01:18:20,471 --> 01:18:23,065
"a lonely man
talking about the weather.

928
01:18:23,511 --> 01:18:25,388
"I tried to be pleasant
and accommodating...

929
01:18:25,831 --> 01:18:27,867
"but my head began
to hurt from his banality.

930
01:18:28,311 --> 01:18:30,142
"I almost didn't notice
it had happened...

931
01:18:30,591 --> 01:18:33,059
"but I suddenly threw up
all over him.

932
01:18:33,511 --> 01:18:35,103
"He was not pleased...

933
01:18:35,551 --> 01:18:37,667
"and I couldn't stop laughing."

934
01:18:38,991 --> 01:18:40,219
No dates.

935
01:18:40,671 --> 01:18:44,107
Placed on the shelves
in no discernible order.

936
01:18:44,551 --> 01:18:47,349
Just his mind
poured out on paper.

937
01:18:47,791 --> 01:18:48,860
Looks like a life's work.

938
01:18:49,311 --> 01:18:53,099
Even with fifty men reading,
it would take two months.

939
01:18:53,551 --> 01:18:55,348
I know, I know.

940
01:18:57,751 --> 01:18:59,707
Where's that phone?

941
01:19:02,751 --> 01:19:05,549
Phone?

942
01:19:08,111 --> 01:19:09,703
People, quiet!

943
01:19:25,511 --> 01:19:26,466
I admire you.

944
01:19:26,911 --> 01:19:28,788
I don't know
how you found me...

945
01:19:29,231 --> 01:19:30,710
but imagine my surprise.

946
01:19:31,151 --> 01:19:34,939
I respect you law enforcement
agents more every day.

947
01:19:35,391 --> 01:19:38,189
I appreciate that, John.

948
01:19:38,631 --> 01:19:39,859
-I tell you...
-No, you listen.

949
01:19:40,311 --> 01:19:41,187
I'll be readjusting
my schedule...

950
01:19:41,631 --> 01:19:44,065
in light of
today's little setback.

951
01:19:44,511 --> 01:19:46,422
I just had to call
and express my admiration.

952
01:19:46,871 --> 01:19:49,305
I'm sorry I had to hurt
one of you...

953
01:19:49,751 --> 01:19:51,787
but I didn't
have a choice, did l?

954
01:19:52,231 --> 01:19:53,710
Will you accept my apology?

955
01:19:54,151 --> 01:19:56,711
I would say more,
but I'd ruin the surprise.

956
01:20:00,271 --> 01:20:01,784
I'll be readjusting
my schedule...

957
01:20:02,231 --> 01:20:03,710
in light of
today's little setback.

958
01:20:04,151 --> 01:20:05,630
Got it.

959
01:20:09,311 --> 01:20:11,506
All right,
everybody back to work.

960
01:20:13,311 --> 01:20:15,950
You were right.
He's preaching.

961
01:20:16,391 --> 01:20:20,543
Yeah. These murders
are his sermons to us.

962
01:20:20,991 --> 01:20:24,222
Look, we know him, him, him.

963
01:20:26,751 --> 01:20:28,264
Who's the blonde?

964
01:20:32,631 --> 01:20:33,825
Looks like a pro.

965
01:20:34,271 --> 01:20:37,308
Maybe she caught John Doe's eye.

966
01:20:42,511 --> 01:20:45,389
He collected it last night.

967
01:20:45,831 --> 01:20:47,901
Last night? This man?

968
01:20:48,351 --> 01:20:50,581
John Doe. Easy name.
He had a limp.

969
01:20:51,031 --> 01:20:52,703
What was the job
you did for him?

970
01:20:53,151 --> 01:20:56,382
I've got a picture.
One sweet piece.

971
01:20:56,831 --> 01:20:59,220
I thought he was one of them
performance artists.

972
01:20:59,671 --> 01:21:02,629
Sort of guy that pisses
in a cap onstage...

973
01:21:03,071 --> 01:21:04,948
and then drinks it.

974
01:21:05,391 --> 01:21:06,870
Performance art.

975
01:21:11,071 --> 01:21:12,982
I think I undercharged him,
actually.

976
01:21:13,431 --> 01:21:15,149
You made this for him?

977
01:21:15,591 --> 01:21:18,469
I've made weirder shit
than that. So what?

978
01:21:22,671 --> 01:21:24,548
They found the blonde.

979
01:21:27,391 --> 01:21:30,224
The picture!

980
01:21:31,431 --> 01:21:33,183
Fucking pigs!

981
01:21:37,271 --> 01:21:39,705
Get the fuck
out of the booth, pal!

982
01:21:40,151 --> 01:21:43,188
I've been in this cage
the whole time!

983
01:21:43,631 --> 01:21:44,746
Come on. This way!

984
01:21:50,431 --> 01:21:52,865
Can you do something
about this music?

985
01:21:53,311 --> 01:21:56,223
We're working on it.
We're looking for the guy.

986
01:22:08,031 --> 01:22:10,499
You from Homicide?
Better see this.

987
01:22:10,951 --> 01:22:12,225
Stay still, all right?

988
01:22:20,751 --> 01:22:24,141
God, get this thing off of me!

989
01:22:24,591 --> 01:22:27,947
Get him out of here now!

990
01:22:28,391 --> 01:22:31,224
Come on.
I want to hear it again.

991
01:22:31,671 --> 01:22:33,229
Tell me again.

992
01:22:35,111 --> 01:22:38,421
You heard nothing strange?
Saw nothing strange?

993
01:22:41,991 --> 01:22:45,267
He asked if I was married,
and I could see he had a gun.

994
01:22:45,711 --> 01:22:46,541
Where was the girl?

995
01:22:46,991 --> 01:22:48,743
The what? What?

996
01:22:49,191 --> 01:22:51,307
The girl. The prostitute.
Where was she?

997
01:22:51,751 --> 01:22:53,981
Someone comes
to your establishment...

998
01:22:54,431 --> 01:22:57,787
they want to go downstairs
to get a little whatever...

999
01:22:58,231 --> 01:23:00,222
they got to come to you?

1000
01:23:02,231 --> 01:23:04,904
You didn't see anyone
with a package...

1001
01:23:05,351 --> 01:23:07,467
a knapsack,
something under their arm?

1002
01:23:07,911 --> 01:23:09,060
Everybody
that comes in there...

1003
01:23:09,511 --> 01:23:11,786
has got a package
under their arms.

1004
01:23:12,231 --> 01:23:15,029
Some guys are carrying
suitcases full of stuff.

1005
01:23:15,471 --> 01:23:19,703
She was just sitting
on the bed.

1006
01:23:24,231 --> 01:23:26,062
Who tied her down,
you or him?

1007
01:23:26,511 --> 01:23:28,979
Do you like
what you do for a living?

1008
01:23:29,431 --> 01:23:30,705
These things you see?

1009
01:23:31,151 --> 01:23:34,302
No. No, I don't.

1010
01:23:36,191 --> 01:23:38,341
But that's life, isn't it?

1011
01:23:41,551 --> 01:23:43,587
He had a gun...

1012
01:23:44,031 --> 01:23:47,910
and he made it happen.

1013
01:23:49,391 --> 01:23:51,268
He made me do it.

1014
01:23:51,711 --> 01:23:54,384
He put that thing on me.

1015
01:23:54,831 --> 01:23:56,981
Then he made me wear it.

1016
01:23:57,431 --> 01:24:00,787
Then he told me to fuck her.

1017
01:24:02,791 --> 01:24:04,509
And I did. I fucked her!

1018
01:24:04,951 --> 01:24:06,782
Oh, God.

1019
01:24:07,231 --> 01:24:09,620
He had a gun in my mouth.

1020
01:24:10,071 --> 01:24:12,426
The fucking gun
was in my throat!

1021
01:24:12,871 --> 01:24:14,782
Fuck!

1022
01:24:16,711 --> 01:24:18,508
Oh, God! God!

1023
01:24:18,951 --> 01:24:20,509
God, help me. Please.

1024
01:24:20,951 --> 01:24:23,340
Please help me!

1025
01:24:39,791 --> 01:24:41,907
This isn't going
to have a happy ending.

1026
01:24:42,351 --> 01:24:45,184
Hey, man. We catch him,
I'll be happy enough.

1027
01:24:48,151 --> 01:24:49,425
If we catch John Doe...

1028
01:24:49,871 --> 01:24:52,305
and he turns out
to be Satan himself...

1029
01:24:52,751 --> 01:24:55,902
that might live up
to our expectations, but...

1030
01:24:56,351 --> 01:24:57,625
he's not the devil.

1031
01:24:59,231 --> 01:25:00,380
He's just a man.

1032
01:25:00,831 --> 01:25:07,100
You bitch and you complain
and tell me these things and...

1033
01:25:07,551 --> 01:25:09,621
If you're preparing me
for hard times...

1034
01:25:10,071 --> 01:25:11,186
thank you, but...

1035
01:25:11,631 --> 01:25:14,429
But you got to be a hero.

1036
01:25:14,871 --> 01:25:16,350
You want to be a champion.

1037
01:25:16,791 --> 01:25:18,270
People don't want a champion.

1038
01:25:18,711 --> 01:25:20,542
They want cheeseburgers,
lotto, and television.

1039
01:25:20,991 --> 01:25:24,666
How did you get like this?
I want to know.

1040
01:25:25,111 --> 01:25:26,100
Well...

1041
01:25:28,631 --> 01:25:31,464
It wasn't one thing,
I can tell you that.

1042
01:25:32,911 --> 01:25:34,185
Go on.

1043
01:25:36,511 --> 01:25:38,103
I just don't think
I can continue...

1044
01:25:38,551 --> 01:25:40,064
to live in a place
that embraces...

1045
01:25:40,511 --> 01:25:43,662
and nurtures apathy
as if it was a virtue.

1046
01:25:44,111 --> 01:25:45,624
You're no different,
no better.

1047
01:25:46,071 --> 01:25:48,539
I didn't say I was.
I'm not.

1048
01:25:48,991 --> 01:25:51,380
Hell, I sympathize completely.

1049
01:25:51,831 --> 01:25:53,822
Apathy is a solution.

1050
01:25:54,271 --> 01:25:57,229
It's easier to lose
yourself in drugs...

1051
01:25:57,671 --> 01:25:59,423
than it is to cope with life.

1052
01:25:59,871 --> 01:26:02,339
It's easier to steal
what you want than earn it.

1053
01:26:02,791 --> 01:26:05,100
It's easier to beat a child
than raise it.

1054
01:26:05,551 --> 01:26:07,781
Hell, love costs,
takes effort, work.

1055
01:26:08,231 --> 01:26:10,950
We are talking about people
who are mentally ill...

1056
01:26:11,391 --> 01:26:12,744
people who are fucking crazies.

1057
01:26:13,191 --> 01:26:14,988
-No, we're not.
-Yes, today.

1058
01:26:15,431 --> 01:26:17,899
We're talking about
everyday life here.

1059
01:26:18,351 --> 01:26:21,263
You can't afford
to be this naive.

1060
01:26:21,711 --> 01:26:22,939
Fuck off.

1061
01:26:24,431 --> 01:26:26,103
You should listen to yourself.

1062
01:26:26,551 --> 01:26:30,988
"The problem with people
is that they don't care...

1063
01:26:31,431 --> 01:26:33,547
"so I don't care about people."

1064
01:26:33,991 --> 01:26:35,424
That makes no sense.

1065
01:26:35,871 --> 01:26:38,704
-You care?
-Damn right.

1066
01:26:39,151 --> 01:26:40,220
And you're going to
make a difference.

1067
01:26:40,671 --> 01:26:41,706
Whatever.
The point is...

1068
01:26:42,151 --> 01:26:44,460
is that I don't
think you're quitting...

1069
01:26:44,911 --> 01:26:47,425
because you believe
these things you say.

1070
01:26:47,871 --> 01:26:49,145
I think you want
to believe them...

1071
01:26:49,591 --> 01:26:51,104
because you're quitting.

1072
01:26:52,991 --> 01:26:55,869
You want me to agree with you
and say, "Yeah, you're right.

1073
01:26:56,311 --> 01:26:58,461
"It's all fucked up.
It's a fucking mess.

1074
01:26:58,911 --> 01:27:02,187
"We should all go live
in a fucking log cabin."

1075
01:27:02,631 --> 01:27:05,748
But I won't say that.

1076
01:27:06,991 --> 01:27:08,390
I don't agree with you.

1077
01:27:08,831 --> 01:27:10,264
I do not.

1078
01:27:12,911 --> 01:27:14,469
I can't.

1079
01:27:24,031 --> 01:27:26,022
I'm going to go home.

1080
01:27:33,471 --> 01:27:35,029
Thank you, though.

1081
01:28:04,071 --> 01:28:07,905
I love you, honey, so much.

1082
01:28:09,391 --> 01:28:11,427
So much.

1083
01:28:15,791 --> 01:28:16,906
I know.

1084
01:29:16,711 --> 01:29:19,145
Nine-one-one.
What's your emergency?

1085
01:29:20,111 --> 01:29:20,782
Could you repeat that?

1086
01:29:21,231 --> 01:29:24,621
I've gone and done it again.

1087
01:29:33,671 --> 01:29:35,070
What have you got?

1088
01:29:35,511 --> 01:29:37,342
Sleeping pills...

1089
01:29:38,591 --> 01:29:39,910
glued to one hand.

1090
01:29:40,351 --> 01:29:41,784
Telephone glued to the other.

1091
01:29:43,311 --> 01:29:44,221
You see what he did?

1092
01:29:44,671 --> 01:29:48,710
He sliced her up,
then he bandaged her.

1093
01:29:49,151 --> 01:29:54,020
Call for help,
and you'll live disfigured...

1094
01:29:54,471 --> 01:29:57,304
or you can put yourself
out of your own misery.

1095
01:29:57,751 --> 01:29:59,184
Come on.

1096
01:29:59,631 --> 01:30:00,859
Cut off her nose.

1097
01:30:01,311 --> 01:30:02,585
To spite her face.

1098
01:30:03,031 --> 01:30:06,023
He did it very recently.

1099
01:30:11,951 --> 01:30:16,866
I've decided to stay on
till this is done.

1100
01:30:17,311 --> 01:30:18,949
One of two things will happen.

1101
01:30:19,391 --> 01:30:20,460
Either we'll get John Doe...

1102
01:30:20,911 --> 01:30:22,230
or he'll finish
his series of seven...

1103
01:30:22,671 --> 01:30:23,547
and this case
will go on for years.

1104
01:30:23,991 --> 01:30:25,663
You don't have
to do me any favours.

1105
01:30:26,111 --> 01:30:26,861
Thank you, but...

1106
01:30:27,311 --> 01:30:29,825
Keep me as your partner
a few more days.

1107
01:30:30,271 --> 01:30:32,148
You'll be doing me a favour.

1108
01:30:42,271 --> 01:30:45,069
You knew I'd say yes.
Hey, we're here.

1109
01:30:45,511 --> 01:30:46,182
Your wife called.

1110
01:30:46,631 --> 01:30:48,428
Get yourself
an answering machine.

1111
01:30:50,271 --> 01:30:52,227
Detective.

1112
01:30:54,071 --> 01:30:56,266
After this, I'm gone.

1113
01:30:56,711 --> 01:30:57,666
No big surprise.

1114
01:30:58,111 --> 01:30:59,988
Detective!

1115
01:31:01,231 --> 01:31:03,301
You're looking for me.

1116
01:31:05,831 --> 01:31:08,026
Don't fucking move!
On the floor!

1117
01:31:08,471 --> 01:31:10,029
Keep away from him!

1118
01:31:10,471 --> 01:31:11,108
I know you.

1119
01:31:11,551 --> 01:31:12,666
Now! Get down!

1120
01:31:13,111 --> 01:31:14,749
Get down!
On your stomach!

1121
01:31:15,191 --> 01:31:16,306
You piece of shit!

1122
01:31:16,751 --> 01:31:17,706
Now! All the way!

1123
01:31:18,151 --> 01:31:21,461
All the way, fucker!
Down! Faster!

1124
01:31:21,911 --> 01:31:23,503
Faster, fucker! Now!

1125
01:31:23,951 --> 01:31:25,828
Nose on the ground!

1126
01:31:28,591 --> 01:31:29,421
Jesus Christ.

1127
01:31:29,871 --> 01:31:31,304
What the fuck is this?

1128
01:31:31,751 --> 01:31:34,902
I'd like to speak
to my lawyer, please.

1129
01:31:36,511 --> 01:31:38,069
God damn it!

1130
01:31:39,271 --> 01:31:41,865
He cuts the skin
off his fingers.

1131
01:31:42,311 --> 01:31:45,940
That's why we couldn't
find one usable print.

1132
01:31:46,391 --> 01:31:48,427
He's been doing it
for quite some time.

1133
01:31:48,871 --> 01:31:51,101
What about the trace
on his bank accounts?

1134
01:31:51,551 --> 01:31:53,269
So far everything's
a dead end.

1135
01:31:53,711 --> 01:31:55,667
No credit history,
no employment records.

1136
01:31:56,111 --> 01:31:57,749
His bank account's
only five years old.

1137
01:31:58,191 --> 01:31:59,306
It was started with cash.

1138
01:31:59,751 --> 01:32:01,343
We're even trying
to trace his furniture.

1139
01:32:01,791 --> 01:32:03,907
The only thing we know
about that guy right now...

1140
01:32:04,351 --> 01:32:07,229
is he's independently
wealthy, well-educated...

1141
01:32:07,671 --> 01:32:08,786
and totally insane.

1142
01:32:09,231 --> 01:32:10,823
Because he's John Doe by choice.

1143
01:32:11,271 --> 01:32:12,386
When do we question him?

1144
01:32:12,831 --> 01:32:15,220
You don't.
He's going to court now.

1145
01:32:15,671 --> 01:32:17,901
There's no way he would
just turn himself in.

1146
01:32:18,351 --> 01:32:19,784
It doesn't make any sense.

1147
01:32:20,231 --> 01:32:22,904
There he sits.
It's not supposed to make sense.

1148
01:32:23,351 --> 01:32:24,466
He's not finished.

1149
01:32:24,911 --> 01:32:27,425
He's pissing in our faces
and we're taking it.

1150
01:32:27,871 --> 01:32:30,180
You know what
I'm talking about.

1151
01:32:30,631 --> 01:32:35,261
For the first time ever,
we are in total agreement.

1152
01:32:35,711 --> 01:32:37,508
So what the fuck, man?

1153
01:32:37,951 --> 01:32:40,749
He's two murders away
from completing his masterpiece.

1154
01:32:41,191 --> 01:32:44,342
We'll wait for his plea.

1155
01:32:47,351 --> 01:32:48,784
My client says
there are two more bodies...

1156
01:32:49,391 --> 01:32:51,541
two more victims hidden away.

1157
01:32:51,991 --> 01:32:54,266
He will take Detectives
Mills and Somerset to them...

1158
01:32:54,711 --> 01:32:56,303
but only Detectives
Mills and Somerset...

1159
01:32:56,751 --> 01:32:58,230
only at 6.00 today.

1160
01:32:58,671 --> 01:32:59,421
Why us?

1161
01:32:59,871 --> 01:33:02,226
He says he admires you.

1162
01:33:03,671 --> 01:33:04,740
It's part of the game.

1163
01:33:05,191 --> 01:33:07,227
My client claims
if they do not accept...

1164
01:33:07,671 --> 01:33:09,502
these bodies
will never be found.

1165
01:33:09,951 --> 01:33:12,465
Frankly, counsel,
I'm inclined to let them rot.

1166
01:33:12,911 --> 01:33:16,028
We've got him downstairs,
locked up, done deal.

1167
01:33:16,471 --> 01:33:19,429
He'll get room and board,
cable TV.

1168
01:33:19,871 --> 01:33:21,941
Hell, my wife doesn't
even have cable.

1169
01:33:22,391 --> 01:33:23,744
Why are we having
this conversation?

1170
01:33:24,191 --> 01:33:26,785
Something stinks.
And this one here...

1171
01:33:27,231 --> 01:33:29,062
Yeah, you,
in your $3,000 suit...

1172
01:33:29,511 --> 01:33:33,140
and that smug smile,
dealing for that shit...

1173
01:33:33,591 --> 01:33:35,866
I am required by law
to serve my clients.

1174
01:33:36,311 --> 01:33:37,187
Jesus Christ.

1175
01:33:37,631 --> 01:33:38,620
And their best interests.

1176
01:33:39,071 --> 01:33:40,663
We don't make deals here.

1177
01:33:41,111 --> 01:33:43,386
My client says
if you do not accept...

1178
01:33:43,831 --> 01:33:44,946
he will plead insanity.

1179
01:33:45,391 --> 01:33:48,906
Let him try it.
I'd like to see him try.

1180
01:33:49,351 --> 01:33:52,024
With the nature
of these crimes...

1181
01:33:52,471 --> 01:33:54,541
I could get him off
with such a plea.

1182
01:33:54,991 --> 01:33:56,709
I'm not letting
this conviction slide.

1183
01:33:57,151 --> 01:34:00,461
If you do accept,
under his specific conditions...

1184
01:34:00,911 --> 01:34:03,630
he will sign a full confession,
plead guilty right now.

1185
01:34:04,071 --> 01:34:06,221
It's your case.
Make a decision.

1186
01:34:07,951 --> 01:34:10,101
Full confession. I'm in.

1187
01:34:10,551 --> 01:34:13,145
It has to be the both of you.

1188
01:34:13,591 --> 01:34:15,627
If he were to claim insanity...

1189
01:34:16,071 --> 01:34:18,141
this conversation
is admissible...

1190
01:34:18,591 --> 01:34:20,866
the fact he's blackmailing us
with his plea.

1191
01:34:21,311 --> 01:34:23,302
My client reminds you
two more are dead.

1192
01:34:23,751 --> 01:34:26,265
The press would have
a field day if the police...

1193
01:34:26,711 --> 01:34:29,544
didn't seem too concerned
about finding them.

1194
01:34:29,991 --> 01:34:31,470
If there are two more dead.

1195
01:34:31,911 --> 01:34:35,824
The lab report came.
Quickie on Doe's clothing.

1196
01:34:36,271 --> 01:34:39,183
They found blood from Doe
slicing his fingers...

1197
01:34:39,631 --> 01:34:42,191
blood from the woman
whose face he cut off...

1198
01:34:42,631 --> 01:34:46,943
and blood from a third party,
as yet unidentified.

1199
01:34:49,431 --> 01:34:51,865
You'd be escorting
an unarmed man.

1200
01:34:54,431 --> 01:34:56,342
Let's finish it.

1201
01:34:59,311 --> 01:35:02,303
If John Doe's head opens
and a UFO flies out...

1202
01:35:02,751 --> 01:35:05,504
I want you
to have expected it.

1203
01:35:07,071 --> 01:35:08,390
I will.

1204
01:35:10,671 --> 01:35:13,185
Man, if I was to accidentally
shave off a nipple...

1205
01:35:13,631 --> 01:35:15,861
would it be covered
by workman's comp?

1206
01:35:19,831 --> 01:35:21,583
I suppose so.

1207
01:35:22,831 --> 01:35:25,106
If you were man enough
to file a claim...

1208
01:35:25,551 --> 01:35:28,065
I'd buy you one
out of my own pocket.

1209
01:35:28,511 --> 01:35:29,864
I keep coming home late...

1210
01:35:30,311 --> 01:35:32,302
my wife's going to think
something's up.

1211
01:35:40,871 --> 01:35:41,986
You know...

1212
01:35:50,231 --> 01:35:51,584
What?

1213
01:37:00,431 --> 01:37:01,546
Let's go!

1214
01:37:32,591 --> 01:37:34,104
Spin it around!

1215
01:37:34,551 --> 01:37:35,586
There he is.

1216
01:37:36,031 --> 01:37:38,545
Late model black sedan
at ten o'clock.

1217
01:37:47,591 --> 01:37:51,106
Who are you, John?
Who are you really?

1218
01:37:51,551 --> 01:37:52,461
What do you mean?

1219
01:37:52,911 --> 01:37:53,741
At this stage...

1220
01:37:54,191 --> 01:37:56,227
what harm can it do
to tell us about yourself?

1221
01:37:56,671 --> 01:37:59,504
Doesn't matter. Who I am
means absolutely nothing.

1222
01:37:59,951 --> 01:38:02,067
You need to stay
on your left up here.

1223
01:38:05,511 --> 01:38:07,103
So where are we heading?

1224
01:38:08,151 --> 01:38:09,061
You'll see.

1225
01:38:09,511 --> 01:38:13,629
We're not just going
to two more bodies, are we?

1226
01:38:14,071 --> 01:38:15,470
That wouldn't be
shocking enough.

1227
01:38:15,911 --> 01:38:18,471
We've got newspapers
to think about, yeah?

1228
01:38:19,791 --> 01:38:21,622
Wanting people to listen...

1229
01:38:22,071 --> 01:38:25,347
you can't just tap them
on the shoulder anymore.

1230
01:38:25,791 --> 01:38:27,861
You have to hit them
with a sledge hammer.

1231
01:38:28,311 --> 01:38:30,700
Then you'll notice you've got
their strict attention.

1232
01:38:31,151 --> 01:38:33,028
But the question is...

1233
01:38:33,471 --> 01:38:35,507
what makes you so special
that people should listen?

1234
01:38:35,951 --> 01:38:37,066
I'm not special.

1235
01:38:37,511 --> 01:38:40,503
I've never been exceptional.

1236
01:38:40,951 --> 01:38:43,260
This is, though,
what I'm doing.

1237
01:38:43,711 --> 01:38:44,427
My work.

1238
01:38:44,871 --> 01:38:46,384
Your work, John?

1239
01:38:47,791 --> 01:38:50,703
I don't see anything special
about it, John.

1240
01:38:51,151 --> 01:38:53,187
That's not true.

1241
01:38:53,631 --> 01:38:55,940
No, it is true,
and the funny thing is...

1242
01:38:56,391 --> 01:38:58,427
all this work,
two months from now...

1243
01:38:58,871 --> 01:39:01,510
no one's going to give a shit
or remember.

1244
01:39:01,951 --> 01:39:05,227
You can't see
the whole complete act yet...

1245
01:39:05,671 --> 01:39:07,343
but when this is done...

1246
01:39:07,791 --> 01:39:10,146
when it's finished...

1247
01:39:11,791 --> 01:39:13,383
it's going to be...

1248
01:39:15,951 --> 01:39:18,829
People will barely
be able to comprehend...

1249
01:39:19,271 --> 01:39:21,262
but they won't be able to deny.

1250
01:39:21,711 --> 01:39:24,179
Could the freak
be any more vague?

1251
01:39:24,631 --> 01:39:26,826
As far as master plans go...

1252
01:39:27,271 --> 01:39:31,389
I can't wait for you to see.
It's going to be something.

1253
01:39:31,831 --> 01:39:34,948
I'm going to be
right next to you...

1254
01:39:35,391 --> 01:39:38,303
so when this big thing happens,
let me know.

1255
01:39:38,751 --> 01:39:39,547
I wouldn't want to miss it.

1256
01:39:39,991 --> 01:39:43,301
Don't worry. You won't.

1257
01:39:45,151 --> 01:39:47,346
You won't miss a thing.

1258
01:39:52,991 --> 01:39:55,221
Roger. Going south.
Keep two miles separation.

1259
01:39:55,671 --> 01:39:56,990
Roger.

1260
01:40:11,991 --> 01:40:13,822
What's so exciting?

1261
01:40:14,271 --> 01:40:17,104
It's not too far now.

1262
01:40:23,751 --> 01:40:26,219
I've been trying to figure
something in my head.

1263
01:40:26,671 --> 01:40:28,548
Maybe you can help me out?

1264
01:40:30,071 --> 01:40:33,507
When a person is insane,
as you clearly are...

1265
01:40:33,951 --> 01:40:35,384
do you know
that you're insane?

1266
01:40:35,831 --> 01:40:37,742
Maybe you're reading
"Guns & Ammo..."

1267
01:40:38,191 --> 01:40:39,863
masturbating
in your own faeces...

1268
01:40:40,311 --> 01:40:41,903
do you stop and go...

1269
01:40:42,351 --> 01:40:45,388
"Wow, it is amazing
how fucking crazy I really am"?

1270
01:40:45,831 --> 01:40:48,470
Do you guys do that?

1271
01:40:48,911 --> 01:40:51,300
It's more comfortable
for you to label me insane.

1272
01:40:51,751 --> 01:40:52,786
It's very comfortable.

1273
01:40:53,231 --> 01:40:56,462
It's not something
I'd expect you to accept...

1274
01:40:56,911 --> 01:40:58,629
but I did not choose.

1275
01:40:59,071 --> 01:40:59,787
I was chosen.

1276
01:41:00,231 --> 01:41:00,947
Whatever.

1277
01:41:01,391 --> 01:41:03,825
I don't doubt
that you believe that...

1278
01:41:04,271 --> 01:41:05,226
but seems to me...

1279
01:41:05,671 --> 01:41:07,787
you're overlooking
a glaring contradiction.

1280
01:41:08,231 --> 01:41:09,505
Meaning what?

1281
01:41:09,951 --> 01:41:11,748
Glad you asked.

1282
01:41:13,871 --> 01:41:19,582
If you were chosen
by a higher power...

1283
01:41:20,031 --> 01:41:22,750
and if your hand was forced,
seems strange to me...

1284
01:41:23,191 --> 01:41:25,068
you would get
such enjoyment out of it.

1285
01:41:25,511 --> 01:41:28,230
You enjoyed torturing
those people.

1286
01:41:29,471 --> 01:41:33,066
Just doesn't seem in keeping
with martyrdom, does it?

1287
01:41:39,551 --> 01:41:41,223
I doubt
I enjoyed it any more...

1288
01:41:41,671 --> 01:41:43,821
than Detective Mills would
enjoy time alone with me...

1289
01:41:44,271 --> 01:41:46,307
in a room without windows.

1290
01:41:46,751 --> 01:41:48,343
Isn't that true?

1291
01:41:48,791 --> 01:41:50,986
How happy would it make you
to hurt me with impunity?

1292
01:41:51,431 --> 01:41:54,503
That hurts my feelings.

1293
01:41:54,951 --> 01:41:57,590
You wouldn't only because
there's consequences.

1294
01:41:58,751 --> 01:42:01,060
It's in those eyes of yours,
though.

1295
01:42:01,511 --> 01:42:03,945
Nothing wrong with a man
taking pleasure in his work.

1296
01:42:04,391 --> 01:42:07,030
I won't deny
my own personal desire...

1297
01:42:07,471 --> 01:42:10,383
to turn each sin
against the sinner.

1298
01:42:10,831 --> 01:42:13,709
I thought all you did
was kill innocent people.

1299
01:42:15,511 --> 01:42:17,706
Innocent?
ls that supposed to be funny?

1300
01:42:18,151 --> 01:42:22,383
An obese man, a disgusting man
who could barely stand up...

1301
01:42:22,831 --> 01:42:24,901
who you'd point
out to friends...

1302
01:42:25,351 --> 01:42:26,830
so they could join you
in mocking him.

1303
01:42:27,271 --> 01:42:29,068
If you saw him
while you were eating...

1304
01:42:29,511 --> 01:42:31,741
you wouldn't be able
to finish your meal.

1305
01:42:32,191 --> 01:42:33,180
After him,
I picked the lawyer...

1306
01:42:33,631 --> 01:42:35,383
and you both must have
secretly been thanking me.

1307
01:42:35,831 --> 01:42:41,269
This man dedicated his life
to making money by lying...

1308
01:42:41,711 --> 01:42:43,303
with every breath
that he could muster...

1309
01:42:43,751 --> 01:42:46,219
to keeping murderers
and rapists on the streets!

1310
01:42:46,671 --> 01:42:48,707
Murderers.
Murderers, John, like yourself.

1311
01:42:49,151 --> 01:42:52,507
A woman so ugly inside
that she couldn't bear living...

1312
01:42:52,951 --> 01:42:55,419
if she couldn't be beautiful
on the outside.

1313
01:42:55,871 --> 01:42:56,860
A drug dealer...

1314
01:42:57,311 --> 01:42:59,427
a drug-dealing pederast,
actually.

1315
01:42:59,871 --> 01:43:02,544
And let's not forget
the disease-spreading whore.

1316
01:43:04,751 --> 01:43:06,582
Only in a world this shitty...

1317
01:43:07,031 --> 01:43:08,942
could you even try to say
these were innocent people...

1318
01:43:09,391 --> 01:43:10,665
and keep a straight face.

1319
01:43:13,231 --> 01:43:15,028
But that's the point.

1320
01:43:16,551 --> 01:43:19,270
We see a deadly sin
on every street corner...

1321
01:43:19,711 --> 01:43:20,939
in every home...

1322
01:43:21,391 --> 01:43:22,267
and we tolerate it.

1323
01:43:22,711 --> 01:43:24,588
We tolerate it
because it's common...

1324
01:43:25,031 --> 01:43:27,226
it's trivial.

1325
01:43:27,671 --> 01:43:29,980
We tolerate it
morning, noon, and night.

1326
01:43:33,191 --> 01:43:35,261
Well, not anymore.

1327
01:43:37,031 --> 01:43:39,226
I'm setting the example...

1328
01:43:40,631 --> 01:43:43,862
and what I've done
is going to be puzzled over...

1329
01:43:44,311 --> 01:43:45,664
and studied...

1330
01:43:46,991 --> 01:43:48,185
and followed...

1331
01:43:49,831 --> 01:43:50,980
forever.

1332
01:43:54,151 --> 01:43:55,425
Delusions of grandeur.

1333
01:43:57,151 --> 01:43:58,869
You should be thanking me.

1334
01:43:59,311 --> 01:44:00,505
Why is that, John?

1335
01:44:00,951 --> 01:44:03,226
Because you're going to be
remembered after this.

1336
01:44:03,671 --> 01:44:04,945
Realize, Detective...

1337
01:44:05,391 --> 01:44:07,507
the only reason
that I'm here right now...

1338
01:44:07,951 --> 01:44:09,509
is that I wanted to be.

1339
01:44:09,951 --> 01:44:12,226
No. We would have
got you eventually.

1340
01:44:12,671 --> 01:44:15,265
Oh, really?
So, what were you doing?

1341
01:44:15,711 --> 01:44:17,827
Biding your time,
toying with me?

1342
01:44:18,271 --> 01:44:21,388
Allowing five innocent people
to die...

1343
01:44:21,831 --> 01:44:23,583
until you felt like
springing your trap?

1344
01:44:24,031 --> 01:44:25,510
What was
the indisputable evidence...

1345
01:44:25,951 --> 01:44:29,739
you were going to use on me
before I walked up to you...

1346
01:44:30,191 --> 01:44:32,068
and put my hands in the air?

1347
01:44:32,511 --> 01:44:34,149
John, calm down.

1348
01:44:34,591 --> 01:44:36,786
I seem to remember us
knocking on your door.

1349
01:44:37,231 --> 01:44:38,664
Oh, that's right.

1350
01:44:39,111 --> 01:44:42,581
And I seem to remember
breaking your face.

1351
01:44:46,791 --> 01:44:48,861
You're only alive
because I didn't kill you.

1352
01:44:49,311 --> 01:44:50,664
OK. Sit back.

1353
01:44:51,111 --> 01:44:52,464
I spared you.

1354
01:44:52,911 --> 01:44:54,981
Remember that every time
you look in the mirror...

1355
01:44:55,431 --> 01:44:57,991
at that face of yours
for the rest of your life...

1356
01:44:58,431 --> 01:45:02,060
or for the rest of what life
I've allowed you to have.

1357
01:45:02,511 --> 01:45:03,990
Sit back, you fucking freak!

1358
01:45:04,431 --> 01:45:05,910
Shut your fucking mouth!

1359
01:45:07,391 --> 01:45:09,951
You're no messiah.
You're a movie of the week.

1360
01:45:10,391 --> 01:45:13,747
You're a fucking T-shirt,
at best.

1361
01:45:26,151 --> 01:45:27,948
Don't ask me
to pity those people.

1362
01:45:28,391 --> 01:45:30,780
I don't mourn them any more
than the thousands that died...

1363
01:45:31,231 --> 01:45:32,186
at Sodom and Gomorrah.

1364
01:45:32,631 --> 01:45:35,020
Is that to say
what you were doing...

1365
01:45:35,471 --> 01:45:37,268
was God's good work?

1366
01:45:40,351 --> 01:45:43,423
The Lord works
in mysterious ways.

1367
01:45:45,111 --> 01:45:47,067
Do you see
those high-tension towers?

1368
01:45:47,511 --> 01:45:48,580
That's where we're headed.

1369
01:45:49,031 --> 01:45:50,464
I see where he's talking about.

1370
01:45:50,911 --> 01:45:52,230
Follow the access road.

1371
01:45:58,391 --> 01:46:00,985
-Your signal's breaking up.
-Un-fucking-avoidable, sir.

1372
01:46:01,431 --> 01:46:04,264
We're in Powerline City.
Deal with it.

1373
01:46:04,711 --> 01:46:07,703
There sure as shit
is no ambush out here.

1374
01:46:08,151 --> 01:46:09,470
No fucking nothing out here.

1375
01:46:09,911 --> 01:46:10,707
Can't land near those wires.

1376
01:46:11,151 --> 01:46:13,665
They're coming up behind us
in about two minutes.

1377
01:46:14,111 --> 01:46:15,305
Go up, way up.

1378
01:46:15,751 --> 01:46:19,380
Thirty seconds, back east.
On my mark. Thirty seconds.

1379
01:47:18,191 --> 01:47:19,704
I'm getting him out.

1380
01:47:24,631 --> 01:47:26,110
We've got you in sight.

1381
01:47:26,551 --> 01:47:27,506
Get out...

1382
01:47:27,951 --> 01:47:29,907
slowly.

1383
01:47:30,351 --> 01:47:31,864
Stop.

1384
01:47:32,311 --> 01:47:33,460
Stay.

1385
01:47:36,471 --> 01:47:37,790
What do you got?

1386
01:47:39,231 --> 01:47:40,550
Dead dog.

1387
01:47:41,951 --> 01:47:43,589
I didn't do that.

1388
01:47:49,191 --> 01:47:50,783
What time is it?

1389
01:47:51,231 --> 01:47:52,425
Why?

1390
01:47:52,871 --> 01:47:54,509
I'd like to know.

1391
01:47:57,471 --> 01:47:58,665
7.01 .

1392
01:48:01,671 --> 01:48:02,660
It's close.

1393
01:48:03,111 --> 01:48:05,022
Well, let's go take a look.

1394
01:48:08,391 --> 01:48:09,665
It's this way.

1395
01:48:11,671 --> 01:48:13,866
Bird Two, close your distance.

1396
01:48:14,311 --> 01:48:17,189
They're moving away
from the car.

1397
01:48:21,031 --> 01:48:22,510
We got them, we got them.

1398
01:48:22,951 --> 01:48:23,861
Closing in.

1399
01:48:24,311 --> 01:48:26,142
Negative, negative.

1400
01:48:55,511 --> 01:48:58,583
Down, down, down.

1401
01:48:59,711 --> 01:49:01,349
Watch him.

1402
01:49:01,791 --> 01:49:03,304
There he goes.

1403
01:49:03,751 --> 01:49:06,709
It's good we have
some time to talk.

1404
01:49:11,791 --> 01:49:12,701
Stay on the guy in red.

1405
01:49:13,151 --> 01:49:15,460
Do not take the cross hairs
off him!

1406
01:49:22,671 --> 01:49:26,220
There's a van coming
down the road from the north.

1407
01:49:34,751 --> 01:49:36,230
Be ready for anything now.

1408
01:49:36,671 --> 01:49:39,105
Wait for my signal.
Wait for me.

1409
01:49:44,031 --> 01:49:45,146
Get out of the van!

1410
01:49:47,391 --> 01:49:48,187
Out!

1411
01:49:48,631 --> 01:49:50,223
Jesus Christ, man.
Don't shoot me!

1412
01:49:50,671 --> 01:49:52,389
Step away!

1413
01:49:52,831 --> 01:49:54,264
Turn around.
Put your hands on your head!

1414
01:49:54,711 --> 01:49:56,030
What the hell is going on?

1415
01:49:56,471 --> 01:49:57,904
What are you doing here?

1416
01:49:58,351 --> 01:49:59,704
I'm just delivering
a package, man.

1417
01:50:00,151 --> 01:50:01,869
I got this package
for this guy David...

1418
01:50:02,311 --> 01:50:04,745
Detective David Mills.

1419
01:50:11,391 --> 01:50:12,267
Get it...

1420
01:50:12,711 --> 01:50:14,110
slowly.

1421
01:50:14,551 --> 01:50:16,701
He's opening
the back of the van.

1422
01:50:17,151 --> 01:50:19,221
We've got him in sight.

1423
01:50:24,831 --> 01:50:28,028
This guy paid me 500 bucks
to bring it out here, man.

1424
01:50:28,471 --> 01:50:30,268
He wanted it here
at exactly 7.00.

1425
01:50:30,711 --> 01:50:31,826
Put it down.

1426
01:50:32,871 --> 01:50:34,270
We got a box.

1427
01:50:34,711 --> 01:50:35,826
We got a box!

1428
01:50:36,271 --> 01:50:38,466
Call the bomb squad.
We got a box.

1429
01:50:38,911 --> 01:50:40,060
Face the van.

1430
01:50:40,511 --> 01:50:42,581
Hands up.

1431
01:50:49,311 --> 01:50:50,505
Turn around.

1432
01:50:52,071 --> 01:50:52,867
OK. Go.

1433
01:50:53,311 --> 01:50:55,871
Off you go. Go!

1434
01:50:56,311 --> 01:50:59,030
I'm sending the driver
out on foot.

1435
01:51:01,591 --> 01:51:03,468
He's headed north
along the road.

1436
01:51:03,911 --> 01:51:05,629
Have him picked up.

1437
01:51:14,471 --> 01:51:15,984
I don't know.

1438
01:51:21,791 --> 01:51:23,304
I'm going to open it.

1439
01:51:23,751 --> 01:51:25,548
When I said I admired you...

1440
01:51:25,991 --> 01:51:27,788
I meant what I said.

1441
01:51:44,791 --> 01:51:46,270
There's blood.

1442
01:51:46,711 --> 01:51:48,588
You've made quite a life
for yourself, Detective.

1443
01:51:49,031 --> 01:51:50,225
You should be very proud.

1444
01:51:50,671 --> 01:51:52,707
Shut the fuck up,
you piece of shit.

1445
01:52:18,551 --> 01:52:20,030
California,
stay away from here.

1446
01:52:20,471 --> 01:52:22,780
Stay away from here.
Don't come in here.

1447
01:52:23,231 --> 01:52:24,949
Whatever you hear, stay away.

1448
01:52:25,391 --> 01:52:27,859
John Doe has the upper hand.

1449
01:52:29,551 --> 01:52:30,427
Here he comes.

1450
01:52:30,871 --> 01:52:32,429
-Throw your gun down!
-What?

1451
01:52:32,871 --> 01:52:34,782
I wish I could have
lived like you did.

1452
01:52:35,231 --> 01:52:37,426
What the fuck you talking about?

1453
01:52:37,871 --> 01:52:38,986
Do you hear me, Detective?

1454
01:52:39,431 --> 01:52:41,899
I'm trying to tell you
how much I admire you...

1455
01:52:42,351 --> 01:52:43,306
and your pretty wife.

1456
01:52:43,751 --> 01:52:45,184
What?

1457
01:52:45,631 --> 01:52:46,586
Tracy.

1458
01:52:47,031 --> 01:52:48,623
What you fuckin' say?

1459
01:52:49,071 --> 01:52:51,505
It's disturbing how easily
a member of the press...

1460
01:52:51,951 --> 01:52:54,465
can purchase information
from the men in your precinct.

1461
01:52:54,911 --> 01:52:56,344
What the fuck?

1462
01:52:56,791 --> 01:52:58,588
Throw your gun down!

1463
01:52:59,031 --> 01:53:02,626
I visited your home
this morning after you'd left.

1464
01:53:03,071 --> 01:53:05,631
I tried to play husband.

1465
01:53:06,071 --> 01:53:09,586
I tried to taste
the life of a simple man.

1466
01:53:10,031 --> 01:53:10,747
Throw it away!

1467
01:53:11,191 --> 01:53:13,147
It didn't work out...

1468
01:53:13,591 --> 01:53:17,379
so I took a souvenir...

1469
01:53:18,791 --> 01:53:20,588
her pretty head.

1470
01:53:24,871 --> 01:53:27,101
What the fuck's
he talking about?

1471
01:53:27,551 --> 01:53:28,427
What's going on over there?

1472
01:53:28,871 --> 01:53:30,463
Put the gun down.

1473
01:53:30,911 --> 01:53:31,787
What was in the box?

1474
01:53:32,231 --> 01:53:33,664
Because I envy
your normal life...

1475
01:53:34,111 --> 01:53:34,827
Put the gun down.

1476
01:53:35,271 --> 01:53:36,590
...it seems that envy is my sin.

1477
01:53:37,031 --> 01:53:38,544
Oh, what's in the box?

1478
01:53:38,991 --> 01:53:40,310
What's in the fucking box?

1479
01:53:40,751 --> 01:53:42,070
He just told you.

1480
01:53:42,511 --> 01:53:43,261
You lie!

1481
01:53:43,711 --> 01:53:45,144
You're a fucking liar!

1482
01:53:45,591 --> 01:53:46,706
That's what he wants.

1483
01:53:47,151 --> 01:53:48,903
He wants you to shoot him.

1484
01:53:51,951 --> 01:53:53,782
You tell me that it's not true.

1485
01:53:54,231 --> 01:53:55,869
Become vengeance, David.

1486
01:53:56,311 --> 01:53:57,300
She's all right.
Tell me.

1487
01:53:57,751 --> 01:53:59,582
Become...wrath.

1488
01:54:00,031 --> 01:54:00,827
Tell me she's all right!

1489
01:54:01,271 --> 01:54:03,262
If you murder a suspect,
David...

1490
01:54:04,431 --> 01:54:06,581
You can't throw it all away...

1491
01:54:07,031 --> 01:54:08,749
She begged for her life,
Detective.

1492
01:54:09,191 --> 01:54:12,388
She begged for her life
and for her baby's life.

1493
01:54:12,831 --> 01:54:13,980
Shut up!

1494
01:54:30,711 --> 01:54:32,463
He didn't know.

1495
01:54:45,311 --> 01:54:47,381
Give me the gun, David.

1496
01:54:53,951 --> 01:54:56,545
If you kill him...

1497
01:54:57,831 --> 01:54:59,708
he will win.

1498
01:55:02,831 --> 01:55:04,822
Oh, God!

1499
01:55:21,871 --> 01:55:23,463
Oh, fuck.
He shot him!

1500
01:55:44,591 --> 01:55:46,627
Set it down somewhere.

1501
01:55:48,271 --> 01:55:50,023
Come on. Set us down.

1502
01:55:52,831 --> 01:55:56,187
Holy Christ,
somebody call somebody.

1503
01:55:56,631 --> 01:55:58,542
Call somebody.

1504
01:56:12,231 --> 01:56:15,348
Well, we'll take care of him.

1505
01:56:23,511 --> 01:56:25,024
Whatever he needs.

1506
01:56:26,271 --> 01:56:27,943
Where are you going to be?

1507
01:56:30,351 --> 01:56:31,625
Around.

1508
01:56:35,831 --> 01:56:37,264
I'll be around.

1509
01:56:41,391 --> 01:56:43,268
Ernest Hemingway once wrote...

1510
01:56:43,711 --> 01:56:45,303
"The world is a fine place...

1511
01:56:45,751 --> 01:56:47,469
"and worth fighting for."

1512
01:56:48,791 --> 01:56:51,464
I agree with the second part.
