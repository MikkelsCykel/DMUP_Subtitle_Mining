2
00:03:22,435 --> 00:03:24,403
- Good morning.
- 'Morning.

3
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:28,497
Can you spell "parakeet"?

4
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:30,134
Parakeet.

5
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:32,871
B-l-R-D.

6
00:03:34,147 --> 00:03:36,115
- Wrong. Try again.
- Wrong?

7
00:03:36,183 --> 00:03:38,378
Wrong, Aunt Trish. Try again.

8
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:41,017
- What's for breakfast?
- My turn?

9
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:45,021
Darling, Donna has locked herself
in our bathroom.

10
00:03:45,092 --> 00:03:46,957
Would you get her out of there?

11
00:03:47,027 --> 00:03:50,053
- My favorite role, the wicked stepmother.
- Absolutely.

12
00:03:50,864 --> 00:03:54,129
- It's chilly in here this morning.
- I'll check that.

13
00:03:54,201 --> 00:03:57,568
- You making breakfast?
- Aunt Trish said it's my turn.

14
00:03:57,838 --> 00:03:59,999
Shh with that "Aunt Trish" stuff.

15
00:04:00,441 --> 00:04:03,569
I have been begging you since you got here
not to call her that.

16
00:04:03,645 --> 00:04:07,706
- It's been a month already.
- Bruce, old habits die hard, you know.

17
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:11,852
- Right, they do.
- My mom always calls her Trish.

18
00:04:12,153 --> 00:04:14,383
My grandma always called her Trish.

19
00:04:14,489 --> 00:04:18,220
But Aunt Pat hates it.
She thinks it's déclassé.

20
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,222
Déclassé?

21
00:04:21,696 --> 00:04:24,722
- Call her Pat, will you?
- I'll try.

22
00:04:24,866 --> 00:04:27,391
- You want to help me make breakfast?
- I'd love to.

23
00:04:27,469 --> 00:04:29,437
What does "déclassé" mean?

24
00:04:31,374 --> 00:04:33,808
Come on.
I heard Mom and Pop called last night.

25
00:04:33,876 --> 00:04:34,934
Yeah, they did.

26
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:38,746
Just a second.

27
00:04:38,814 --> 00:04:42,580
We're gonna be late again,
and you still have to use my eyeliner...

28
00:04:42,652 --> 00:04:44,119
which I have.

29
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:49,380
- Here.
- Thanks.

30
00:04:50,026 --> 00:04:51,550
You look great.

31
00:04:51,727 --> 00:04:53,820
Now remember, less is more.

32
00:04:57,334 --> 00:05:01,270
We got eggs, sausage, bacon, dill pickles.
What will it be?

33
00:05:01,872 --> 00:05:03,237
Toast'ems.

34
00:05:03,807 --> 00:05:06,037
No. Not again.

35
00:05:06,209 --> 00:05:08,234
I cook. You set the table.

36
00:05:09,546 --> 00:05:11,776
- Done.
- A masterpiece.

37
00:05:12,015 --> 00:05:15,382
- A veritable Picasso.
- He would have put your nose over here.

38
00:05:17,154 --> 00:05:18,678
Can I borrow this?

39
00:05:20,992 --> 00:05:24,428
- You look like an Eskimo.
- I'm a California person.

40
00:05:24,495 --> 00:05:26,326
I'm not used to wearing this stuff.

41
00:05:26,397 --> 00:05:28,888
Listen, surfer girl,
the week before you got here...

42
00:05:28,966 --> 00:05:32,231
the temperature got above zero
for about six minutes.

43
00:05:32,303 --> 00:05:36,763
If it's this cold inside, you're gonna
appreciate those when you get outside.

44
00:05:37,275 --> 00:05:39,368
Doesn't it ever get warm in Chicago?

45
00:05:39,444 --> 00:05:42,504
You are going to regret
that remark come August, young lady.

46
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:45,572
August? I'm supposed to go home
before August.

47
00:05:46,819 --> 00:05:49,720
If I had my way, I'd keep you here forever.

48
00:05:53,926 --> 00:05:57,362
- What are you gonna wear tonight?
- Last year's salary.

49
00:05:57,529 --> 00:06:00,692
- It wasn't that expensive.
- Yeah?

50
00:06:00,966 --> 00:06:03,161
- What are you gonna wear, Dad?
- My tux.

51
00:06:03,235 --> 00:06:05,999
- The one you wore to your wedding?
- Yeah, that one.

52
00:06:06,071 --> 00:06:10,405
- Fashion's never been your father's thing.
- It's a year old, dear.

53
00:06:10,476 --> 00:06:12,944
I think he looks handsome
in his wedding pictures.

54
00:06:13,012 --> 00:06:15,412
- There you are. The voice of sanity.
- I agree.

55
00:06:15,482 --> 00:06:17,916
- Handsome, but conservative.
- I agree.

56
00:06:17,984 --> 00:06:20,384
Wait a minute,
you're on my side, remember?

57
00:06:20,453 --> 00:06:23,081
A woman's entitled to change her mind.

58
00:06:27,494 --> 00:06:30,019
No, thanks. We'll take the next one.

59
00:06:33,967 --> 00:06:36,094
- Who's driving me to work?
- Me.

60
00:06:36,169 --> 00:06:37,193
Let's go.

61
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:50,815
All aboard.

62
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,649
Thank you, my lady.

63
00:06:56,991 --> 00:06:58,891
Fasten your seat belts.

64
00:06:59,693 --> 00:07:01,888
You better be careful, honey.

65
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:05,963
- Remember what happened to Narcissus.
- Who?

66
00:07:06,668 --> 00:07:10,502
Greek mythology. He loved looking
at his reflection in a pond so much...

67
00:07:10,572 --> 00:07:11,971
he fell in and drowned.

68
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:15,476
- Only a boy could be that clumsy.
- You got that right.

69
00:07:24,252 --> 00:07:25,719
What's wrong?

70
00:07:28,857 --> 00:07:31,382
Every new building has its problems.

71
00:07:32,028 --> 00:07:35,293
We'll get those problems
before they get us, right?

72
00:07:38,167 --> 00:07:39,327
Right?

73
00:07:51,714 --> 00:07:53,306
Hold it, please!

74
00:08:18,642 --> 00:08:20,940
- Bye, honey.
- Have a good day.

75
00:08:21,612 --> 00:08:23,910
- Thanks for the lift.
- 'Bye, Dad.

76
00:08:25,216 --> 00:08:27,446
'Morning, Gene. How you doing?

77
00:08:31,222 --> 00:08:33,315
- 'Morning, Bruce.
- 'Morning.

78
00:08:37,629 --> 00:08:38,929
- 'Morning, Mr. Gardner.
- 'Morning. What's with the heat?

79
00:08:38,929 --> 00:08:40,396
- 'Morning, Mr. Gardner.
- 'Morning. What's with the heat?

80
00:08:40,463 --> 00:08:43,364
I'm checking it now.
Probably a thermo on the fritz.

81
00:08:43,433 --> 00:08:47,665
Get it fixed and have somebody check out
Freight Elevator 15. It's got a stutter in it.

82
00:08:47,737 --> 00:08:48,999
15? Sure.

83
00:08:58,416 --> 00:08:59,508
Wait up!

84
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:12,222
Great! I don't have to go
to that creepy school today.

85
00:09:13,331 --> 00:09:14,355
Oh, no.

86
00:09:14,432 --> 00:09:17,162
Come on, we'll cut them off at the pass.

87
00:09:26,278 --> 00:09:28,405
Our 50 elevators will be carrying...

88
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,745
approximately 12,000 passengers a day...

89
00:09:31,817 --> 00:09:35,446
swiftly and conveniently,
to our many shops, offices...

90
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,750
condominiums, and restaurants.

91
00:09:38,423 --> 00:09:39,651
Come on!

92
00:09:43,629 --> 00:09:47,861
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen,
to a glimpse of the future.

93
00:09:47,934 --> 00:09:49,026
Taxi!

94
00:09:53,339 --> 00:09:55,534
It's hotter than Hell out here.

95
00:09:56,676 --> 00:09:58,200
There they are.

96
00:10:02,181 --> 00:10:05,116
Look, there's that snot Donna
and her yucky little cousin.

97
00:10:05,184 --> 00:10:07,846
- They're late again.
- Cool it, Marcie.

98
00:10:14,294 --> 00:10:15,591
Hi, Donna.

99
00:10:18,565 --> 00:10:22,023
- Sorry.
- It's okay. Your turn on Monday.

100
00:10:22,102 --> 00:10:25,071
You get two fun-filled weeks
to pilot the Enterprise.

101
00:10:25,139 --> 00:10:27,607
- Two weeks?
- Two kids, two weeks.

102
00:10:28,242 --> 00:10:31,700
- Just like me.
- Come on, Mom. We're going to be late.

103
00:10:31,912 --> 00:10:33,277
- Okay.
- 'Bye.

104
00:10:48,997 --> 00:10:53,661
In fact, we like to think we are a city,
a safe, efficient metropolis...

105
00:10:54,169 --> 00:10:57,036
that will take us into the 21st century.

106
00:11:15,891 --> 00:11:17,119
Hi, Mary.

107
00:11:17,193 --> 00:11:19,218
Konnichiwa.

108
00:11:22,465 --> 00:11:25,332
Did you forget to pay the heating bill?
It's freezing here.

109
00:11:25,401 --> 00:11:28,199
I know, it's strange. It's warmer outside.

110
00:11:28,972 --> 00:11:30,667
Why are they moving the Tods?

111
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:34,107
Takamitsu doesn't want them
intermingling with his work, darling.

112
00:11:34,177 --> 00:11:35,940
Is he going to be responsible...

113
00:11:36,012 --> 00:11:39,607
for $26,000 worth
of postmodern neo-abstraction?

114
00:11:39,683 --> 00:11:41,844
You're the one who gave him carte blanche.

115
00:11:41,918 --> 00:11:44,216
Is everything set?
Caterers, brochures, music?

116
00:11:44,287 --> 00:11:47,484
Everything is set.
Calm down, go sit down and relax.

117
00:11:47,557 --> 00:11:49,218
Nothing is gonna go wrong.

118
00:11:52,497 --> 00:11:55,933
- Not over there!
- That's where he told us to put it.

119
00:12:01,405 --> 00:12:03,805
- Take it easy.
- Watch it!

120
00:12:04,142 --> 00:12:05,336
Got it!

121
00:12:05,409 --> 00:12:07,206
It's okay. We got it.

122
00:12:09,881 --> 00:12:12,008
Nothing's going to go wrong.

123
00:12:28,133 --> 00:12:30,761
- You're coming to my party tonight?
- I don't think so.

124
00:12:30,836 --> 00:12:33,396
- How come?
- She can't come to our party tonight.

125
00:12:33,472 --> 00:12:36,168
She has to stay upstairs
and take care of Carol Anne.

126
00:12:36,241 --> 00:12:40,405
Because her mother's having her own party
tonight. I heard her mother tell Mom.

127
00:12:40,479 --> 00:12:44,677
- It's my party, not ours.
- Listen, mouth, Pat's not my mother.

128
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:48,015
And if I wanted to come
to your brother's party, I could.

129
00:13:05,271 --> 00:13:08,035
- You got a second?
- Yeah, what's up, Nate?

130
00:13:08,107 --> 00:13:10,098
Come here, let me show you something.

131
00:13:13,914 --> 00:13:15,939
All right. Where are we going?

132
00:13:25,993 --> 00:13:28,188
What? Somebody broke the mirror.
Replace it.

133
00:13:28,262 --> 00:13:32,995
Not just this panel. Every panel from
the concourse all the way up to the top.

134
00:13:36,837 --> 00:13:38,304
You guys have to see this.

135
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,018
Ice.

136
00:14:01,062 --> 00:14:03,587
Now, how the hell could that happen?

137
00:14:04,033 --> 00:14:06,934
I kind of hoped you'd tell us, Mr. Gardner.

138
00:14:12,541 --> 00:14:15,999
Sally, call the heating
and air conditioning contractor.

139
00:14:16,078 --> 00:14:19,741
Tell Stan to get to my office
with a schematic for the ventilation system.

140
00:14:19,815 --> 00:14:22,443
- Pronto.
- Yes, sir, Mr. Gardner.

141
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:45,870
How come you go to
the Seaton school for weirdoes?

142
00:14:45,976 --> 00:14:48,604
It's for smart kids, not weirdoes.

143
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:50,613
That's why you don't go there.

144
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:55,509
- There she is.
- Yeah, okay.

145
00:15:03,995 --> 00:15:05,963
Thank you, Mrs. Moyer.

146
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:10,197
- Seen any ghosts lately?
- Leave her alone.

147
00:15:10,268 --> 00:15:13,328
- You a cop or something?
- Watch it, you little asshole.

148
00:15:14,372 --> 00:15:15,862
Shut the door.

149
00:15:23,716 --> 00:15:25,445
You're so déclassé.

150
00:15:36,161 --> 00:15:37,253
Damn.

151
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:43,927
Yeah, I know.
The kids have started teasing her.

152
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:47,630
I was hoping we could keep her ghosts
in my closet.

153
00:15:47,706 --> 00:15:50,231
This doesn't make my job any easier.

154
00:15:50,443 --> 00:15:54,038
- That's why you get the big bucks, Doc.
- Funny, Deborah.

155
00:15:54,247 --> 00:15:56,977
- You could call in an exorcist.
- Funnier.

156
00:16:18,272 --> 00:16:21,002
I'm really sorry
you're not coming to the party.

157
00:16:21,075 --> 00:16:22,702
I kind of hoped...

158
00:16:23,677 --> 00:16:24,735
you were.

159
00:16:24,812 --> 00:16:28,304
Scott, my knight in shining acne.

160
00:16:28,449 --> 00:16:30,679
Shut up, and leave them alone.

161
00:16:31,051 --> 00:16:33,952
Maybe we could catch a movie
tomorrow night.

162
00:16:34,121 --> 00:16:35,679
Maybe. Call me.

163
00:16:43,064 --> 00:16:44,793
He's still panting.

164
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:47,562
I wish Dusty would pant that way for me.

165
00:16:47,636 --> 00:16:49,126
Jeff's constantly in heat.

166
00:16:49,204 --> 00:16:52,401
I practically have to muzzle him every night.
It's a real drag.

167
00:16:52,474 --> 00:16:54,772
Maybe he could give Dusty ideas?

168
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:59,173
- I don't know if you could handle it.
- It'll be totally radical to try.

169
00:16:59,247 --> 00:17:02,084
Get a grip, girls.

170
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:11,654
This...

171
00:17:11,961 --> 00:17:15,294
is the Second Piano Concerto by Chopin.

172
00:17:18,701 --> 00:17:21,693
I'll bet all of you probably think...

173
00:17:22,071 --> 00:17:25,973
this was written by some old geezer
who looked like Dr. Seaton.

174
00:17:28,678 --> 00:17:31,408
Well, it wasn't. In fact...

175
00:17:31,848 --> 00:17:36,342
Freddy Chopin composed this
when he was only 19 years old...

176
00:17:37,621 --> 00:17:39,919
and he'd already written a lot.

177
00:17:40,357 --> 00:17:44,157
He'd been playing by ear
and making up tunes since he was 6.

178
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:47,792
At 8...

179
00:17:47,865 --> 00:17:51,096
he had written
his first of several polonaises.

180
00:17:52,169 --> 00:17:55,036
And at the ripe old age of 1 2...

181
00:17:55,439 --> 00:17:58,374
he was asked to play for the Czar of Russia.

182
00:18:01,312 --> 00:18:04,145
Pretty scary, even for an old-timer of 1 2.

183
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:14,487
In this school, where we're dealing with
gifted children with emotional problems...

184
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:16,186
we have to open them up.

185
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:18,195
So, we make them aware of the fact...

186
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:21,562
that other famous child prodigies
shared similar problems.

187
00:18:21,633 --> 00:18:24,727
It makes them comfortable
to know they're not that different.

188
00:18:24,802 --> 00:18:28,431
These kids are about to find out
that Chopin was crippled by shyness...

189
00:18:28,507 --> 00:18:31,442
- And used music to overcome it.
- Excuse me, Dr. Seaton...

190
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:35,844
that little blonde girl keeps staring
at the mirror as if she sees us.

191
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:40,714
- Do you think she can?
- No.

192
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:43,888
But you think she's staring straight at you?

193
00:18:46,392 --> 00:18:50,260
That is one of her dubious talents,
making people believe things.

194
00:18:50,563 --> 00:18:53,259
- Has she ever...
- Let's talk in the hall.

195
00:19:12,385 --> 00:19:14,979
She's a very interesting case,
our Carol Anne.

196
00:19:15,055 --> 00:19:17,888
Reasonably well-balanced,
extremely intelligent...

197
00:19:17,959 --> 00:19:21,690
IQ well into the 150s,
and one hell of an imagination.

198
00:19:21,862 --> 00:19:23,625
- Most bright kids do.
- True...

199
00:19:23,698 --> 00:19:28,067
but even the brightest ones allow adults
to intimidate them back to reality.

200
00:19:28,135 --> 00:19:30,865
"Dad, there's a purple cow in our yard."

201
00:19:31,005 --> 00:19:33,599
"What, are you nuts? Get out of here."

202
00:19:33,674 --> 00:19:36,837
But Carol Anne's different
than most of our other geniuses.

203
00:19:36,911 --> 00:19:39,744
She seems able to project her imagination...

204
00:19:39,814 --> 00:19:43,079
convince others that
the purple cow in the yard is real.

205
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:47,883
Apparently, she actually convinced
an entire neighborhood that it was haunted.

206
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:49,621
There's a talent.

207
00:19:49,691 --> 00:19:52,717
You think she's able to create
some sort of mass hysteria?

208
00:19:52,794 --> 00:19:56,321
No, not really. It's more like mass hypnosis.

209
00:19:56,999 --> 00:20:01,163
As I work with her, try to work with her,
the child's impossible...

210
00:20:01,236 --> 00:20:06,003
the more I'm convinced she actually might
be capable of inducing mass hypnosis.

211
00:20:06,108 --> 00:20:09,566
- Have you put her under?
- Only once. It was terrifying.

212
00:20:09,779 --> 00:20:11,508
- For her?
- For both of us.

213
00:20:11,581 --> 00:20:14,516
I started to experience what she was seeing.

214
00:20:43,113 --> 00:20:44,478
My God.

215
00:20:46,016 --> 00:20:47,483
He found her.

216
00:20:53,691 --> 00:20:56,125
I'm sorry. Stay and finish your tea.

217
00:20:56,527 --> 00:20:58,051
I've got to go.

218
00:21:03,301 --> 00:21:06,998
Mommy, where are you? I can't see you!
Where are you?

219
00:21:07,339 --> 00:21:10,308
He's after me, Mommy! I'm scared!

220
00:21:10,842 --> 00:21:12,969
Yes, I am ready!

221
00:21:13,044 --> 00:21:15,569
I can't find you! He's getting closer!

222
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:16,705
Who?

223
00:21:16,981 --> 00:21:19,541
The man! The ugly man!

224
00:21:20,018 --> 00:21:22,646
I've got you, Carol Anne. You're safe.

225
00:21:24,356 --> 00:21:27,519
You're in your room in Cuesta Verde.
You're safe.

226
00:21:27,792 --> 00:21:29,453
Everything's calm.

227
00:21:44,243 --> 00:21:46,734
Tell me about what's just happened.

228
00:21:47,646 --> 00:21:50,581
The man wanted me
to lead him into the light.

229
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:54,383
It's so cold there. I heard them talking.

230
00:21:54,721 --> 00:21:57,451
He said it was my daddy's fault
because of the houses...

231
00:21:57,524 --> 00:22:00,357
the houses my daddy built on their graves.

232
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:04,123
He said I had to lead them into the light.
Into the light.

233
00:22:04,398 --> 00:22:07,959
- Why do you have to lead them?
- I was born in that house.

234
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:13,465
- Robbie! The tree's eating Robbie!
- Sleep.

235
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:24,777
I'm going to count to three.

236
00:22:25,486 --> 00:22:28,387
And when I snap my fingers,
you will awaken.

237
00:22:28,623 --> 00:22:31,057
You will not remember any of this.

238
00:22:31,225 --> 00:22:32,385
One...

239
00:22:32,794 --> 00:22:33,954
two...

240
00:22:34,529 --> 00:22:35,689
three.

241
00:22:38,933 --> 00:22:40,525
How do you feel?

242
00:22:41,102 --> 00:22:42,194
Okay.

243
00:22:43,838 --> 00:22:45,100
One word.

244
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:48,040
How do you feel deep down inside?

245
00:22:48,844 --> 00:22:50,106
One word.

246
00:22:51,346 --> 00:22:52,813
I don't know.

247
00:22:54,716 --> 00:22:56,206
Lonely, maybe.

248
00:23:02,791 --> 00:23:03,985
Lonely?

249
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:09,922
Sure, why not?

250
00:23:10,766 --> 00:23:13,360
It gets Ionely being away from home,
doesn't it?

251
00:23:13,436 --> 00:23:15,028
Yeah. Aunt...

252
00:23:16,272 --> 00:23:20,333
Pat and Bruce and Donna are real nice,
but I miss my mom and dad.

253
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:22,139
And even my brother.

254
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:35,417
That's very good.

255
00:23:35,892 --> 00:23:38,588
- What?
- The way you made me look in the mirror.

256
00:23:38,661 --> 00:23:40,720
I didn't make you look at anything.

257
00:23:40,798 --> 00:23:43,289
That's what he meant, manipulation.

258
00:23:43,767 --> 00:23:46,099
What were you looking at
that made me turn?

259
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:47,398
Nothing.

260
00:23:48,672 --> 00:23:50,902
You were looking at something.

261
00:23:51,575 --> 00:23:53,236
I don't want to talk about it.

262
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:56,837
When you talk about things
that bother you, they go away.

263
00:23:56,914 --> 00:23:59,439
No, if you talk about things, they happen.

264
00:23:59,517 --> 00:24:01,178
Who told you that?

265
00:24:01,819 --> 00:24:03,047
Go away!

266
00:24:16,568 --> 00:24:18,160
Are you all right?

267
00:24:24,676 --> 00:24:27,270
What happened? What broke the mirror?

268
00:24:31,684 --> 00:24:34,414
A little demonstration in mass hypnosis.

269
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:37,316
She made me believe I saw a coffee mug...

270
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:39,824
fly off my desk into the mirror...

271
00:24:39,992 --> 00:24:42,961
while giving you a suggestion to smash it.

272
00:25:14,828 --> 00:25:16,853
Beautiful sight, isn't it?

273
00:25:18,732 --> 00:25:22,031
Did I ever tell you
how to make a little girl laugh?

274
00:25:22,636 --> 00:25:24,035
I never did?

275
00:25:24,405 --> 00:25:26,498
It takes a lot of practice.

276
00:25:26,874 --> 00:25:29,172
The first thing you got to do...

277
00:25:29,911 --> 00:25:32,311
is tickle right here in the ribs.

278
00:25:35,383 --> 00:25:38,119
Don't worry about
that seven years' bad luck stuff.

279
00:25:38,252 --> 00:25:39,913
That's old wives' tales.

280
00:25:39,987 --> 00:25:42,421
- I didn't break it.
- I believe you.

281
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:44,655
But I'll tell you a secret.

282
00:25:44,725 --> 00:25:47,853
If that old nerd were my doctor,
I would have done it.

283
00:25:47,928 --> 00:25:49,793
I didn't. He did.

284
00:25:50,465 --> 00:25:51,659
Dr. Seaton?

285
00:25:54,836 --> 00:25:57,361
I don't want to talk about it, okay?

286
00:26:29,372 --> 00:26:30,999
How's Carol Anne?

287
00:26:32,008 --> 00:26:33,475
I don't know.

288
00:26:36,679 --> 00:26:41,013
How would you feel if some quack told you
you had supernatural powers?

289
00:26:41,217 --> 00:26:43,879
Do you remember that guy
who was on all the talk shows?

290
00:26:43,954 --> 00:26:47,219
What was his name?
He was from Israel or someplace.

291
00:26:47,291 --> 00:26:49,919
He used to bend keys, fix watches...

292
00:26:50,093 --> 00:26:52,584
took Polaroids of himself in the dark.

293
00:26:52,663 --> 00:26:54,358
Maybe Carol Anne...

294
00:26:54,498 --> 00:26:56,261
Please, not you, too.

295
00:26:56,667 --> 00:26:58,294
Give the kid a break, please.

296
00:26:58,368 --> 00:27:01,235
First your crazy brother-in-law
uses her as a scapegoat...

297
00:27:01,305 --> 00:27:03,830
for those $250,000
collapsible homes he builds...

298
00:27:03,907 --> 00:27:06,569
- Steven didn't...
- Steven and your sister have put...

299
00:27:06,643 --> 00:27:10,909
that poor thing through hell, with
those weirdo psychics and witch doctors.

300
00:27:11,216 --> 00:27:14,743
Weirdo psychics and witch doctors!
Come on!

301
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:19,583
Darling, you are the only sane person
in your family.

302
00:27:19,991 --> 00:27:21,185
Please.

303
00:27:22,794 --> 00:27:25,024
Don't let that pompous-ass shrink...

304
00:27:25,096 --> 00:27:29,226
tell you she's Carrie or Houdini
or some damn thing like that.

305
00:27:29,934 --> 00:27:33,392
Nobody really knows
what happened there this afternoon.

306
00:27:35,274 --> 00:27:37,936
Maybe we shouldn't leave
the girls here alone tonight.

307
00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:41,002
Maybe we should forget
the opening altogether.

308
00:27:41,313 --> 00:27:42,905
Don't be stupid.

309
00:27:44,316 --> 00:27:47,217
We're both being stupid.
You have opening night jitters...

310
00:27:47,286 --> 00:27:49,880
- I have a building falling apart.
- Exactly.

311
00:27:49,955 --> 00:27:54,449
We needed my sister pressuring us to take
her kid like we needed a hole in the head.

312
00:27:54,526 --> 00:27:57,825
I really don't mind
a house full of beautiful women.

313
00:27:58,864 --> 00:28:01,992
- The more the merrier.
- Then hire us a maid.

314
00:28:03,036 --> 00:28:05,061
Swedish, about 24?

315
00:28:06,139 --> 00:28:09,939
- 5'2"? Talk about pressure.
- Will you go get dressed?

316
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:11,534
What did I say?

317
00:28:28,195 --> 00:28:30,993
Hi, sweetie. Can I have a good night kiss?

318
00:28:34,902 --> 00:28:36,130
All set.

319
00:28:36,971 --> 00:28:39,667
- Have a good night's sleep.
- Good night.

320
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,034
Be right with you.

321
00:28:44,312 --> 00:28:48,373
She's got the hots for him. I'm serious.
I see her every single day.

322
00:28:48,516 --> 00:28:51,178
Look for her at the start of the day.
I'm dead serious.

323
00:28:51,252 --> 00:28:54,085
She follows him all the time. Yeah, what?

324
00:28:54,156 --> 00:28:56,056
Will you do me a favor?

325
00:28:56,591 --> 00:28:59,583
- No ghost stories tonight, all right?
- Gotcha.

326
00:29:02,397 --> 00:29:04,331
- Good night.
- 'Bye.

327
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:06,833
My dad.
I don't know what he's talking about.

328
00:29:13,141 --> 00:29:14,665
Not bad at all.

329
00:29:15,844 --> 00:29:17,175
Forget it.

330
00:29:17,646 --> 00:29:19,978
However, after the opening...

331
00:29:38,735 --> 00:29:42,262
I know it's going to be a great party,
but I can't come.

332
00:29:42,505 --> 00:29:45,599
No, I'm brat-sitting.
She's not even a relative.

333
00:29:46,076 --> 00:29:48,874
She's sort of a relative, but not really.

334
00:29:50,114 --> 00:29:53,140
Yeah, if Scott wants to call me
from the party...

335
00:29:53,217 --> 00:29:54,980
I might talk to him.

336
00:30:00,257 --> 00:30:01,315
'Bye.

337
00:30:03,427 --> 00:30:06,089
- What you doing?
- Eavesdropping.

338
00:30:07,131 --> 00:30:10,225
- Why don't you go to Martin's party?
- You know I can't.

339
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:12,996
I'll cover for you, they'll never know.

340
00:30:13,838 --> 00:30:15,931
If I get caught, we'll be in trouble.

341
00:30:16,007 --> 00:30:17,770
I can take the heat.

342
00:30:19,778 --> 00:30:22,872
I didn't mean
what I said to Sandy on the phone.

343
00:30:22,981 --> 00:30:26,940
I don't mind being "sort of a relative."
As long as we're friends.

344
00:30:27,385 --> 00:30:28,477
Good.

345
00:31:04,424 --> 00:31:07,791
There are some people over here
I'd like you to meet.

346
00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:26,602
It looks like the show is a success, darling.

347
00:31:28,215 --> 00:31:31,844
- Like the art. Love the sushi.
- It's nice to see you.

348
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:34,649
Excuse me, Pat, come here,
I've got to talk to you.

349
00:31:34,722 --> 00:31:36,087
Hello, Mary.

350
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:40,884
- Are you trying to save money on the heat?
- I wish that were the case. New equipment.

351
00:31:40,962 --> 00:31:44,454
- Trying to work out the bugs and all that.
- Good to see you.

352
00:31:55,811 --> 00:31:58,109
- You look great.
- Anne Klein II.

353
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:00,148
Remember, less is more.

354
00:32:03,619 --> 00:32:05,143
You look great.

355
00:32:13,662 --> 00:32:15,926
Maybe I ought to stay home
with you tonight.

356
00:32:15,998 --> 00:32:18,228
Just go already. I'll be fine.

357
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:33,671
How come you're taking
your dad's passkey?

358
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:37,686
I'm gonna use the emergency stairs
so nobody sees me in the elevator.

359
00:32:37,754 --> 00:32:40,120
You got Martin's number, right?

360
00:32:40,189 --> 00:32:41,986
- I won't stay long.
- Have fun.

361
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:46,087
- Be good.
- I will.

362
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:25,600
- What's the matter? Is the stereo broken?
- It's my parents.

363
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:28,468
- Thought they weren't gonna be home.
- Tell me about it.

364
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:33,102
My father's not well, and my mom says
if she can hear the party, it's over.

365
00:33:33,645 --> 00:33:37,547
I thought you couldn't come.
Couldn't stay away from hot Scott?

366
00:33:37,616 --> 00:33:40,881
Back to your cage. It's feeding time.

367
00:33:42,254 --> 00:33:45,246
- $50 and she's history.
- You're on!

368
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,463
Hi there.

369
00:33:57,203 --> 00:33:59,865
I can't believe
I risked getting into trouble for this.

370
00:33:59,939 --> 00:34:03,510
I bet we could find some trouble.
Your parents aren't home.

371
00:34:03,643 --> 00:34:06,271
Sounds great.
How many bedrooms have you got?

372
00:34:06,747 --> 00:34:08,840
- Shut up.
- Carol Anne's up there.

373
00:34:08,916 --> 00:34:10,781
Is anything open in the galleria?

374
00:34:10,851 --> 00:34:13,479
Forget it, didn't bring my fake ID.

375
00:34:15,222 --> 00:34:17,520
My stepmom's having a party there.
I can't go.

376
00:34:17,591 --> 00:34:19,991
You're a real killjoy tonight, aren't you?

377
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:23,496
- Isn't there a pool in this building?
- It's locked at night.

378
00:34:23,564 --> 00:34:24,758
But...

379
00:34:29,937 --> 00:34:32,167
G-O-R...

380
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:35,304
l-L-L-A.

381
00:34:36,411 --> 00:34:37,878
That is correct.

382
00:34:37,946 --> 00:34:40,915
Can you spell "pheasant"?

383
00:34:40,982 --> 00:34:43,280
P-H...

384
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:44,013
We're back!

385
00:35:45,882 --> 00:35:48,043
- Leave me alone!
- I've got you!

386
00:35:48,118 --> 00:35:49,585
Let go of me!

387
00:35:53,558 --> 00:35:56,584
You can't get away. I've got you.

388
00:35:57,929 --> 00:35:59,692
You can't get away!

389
00:36:09,774 --> 00:36:11,503
You can't get away.

390
00:36:14,078 --> 00:36:15,477
We need you.

391
00:36:17,316 --> 00:36:19,682
Come here, Carol Anne.

392
00:36:23,722 --> 00:36:24,916
Closer.

393
00:36:29,561 --> 00:36:32,291
You can't get away. I've got you!

394
00:36:33,999 --> 00:36:35,432
I've got you!

395
00:36:35,501 --> 00:36:36,866
Break the mirror.

396
00:36:37,436 --> 00:36:39,063
Break the mirror.

397
00:36:45,478 --> 00:36:46,502
No!

398
00:37:02,195 --> 00:37:03,184
Hello?

399
00:37:05,865 --> 00:37:08,663
- Who is this?
- Carol Anne needs your help.

400
00:37:09,402 --> 00:37:13,133
Kane found her, and it's all your fault.

401
00:37:13,808 --> 00:37:17,972
Carol Anne, are you on this line?
This is one of your little pranks?

402
00:37:18,446 --> 00:37:19,470
Hello?

403
00:37:25,986 --> 00:37:28,045
- Who was that?
- A pest.

404
00:37:29,824 --> 00:37:32,224
Bruce Gardner, please, on Michigan Avenue.

405
00:37:32,293 --> 00:37:35,751
My little pest from the west
playing her little tricks.

406
00:37:36,698 --> 00:37:38,029
Thank you.

407
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:45,636
Jesus Christ!

408
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:51,536
- What did that?
- It's not a what, it's a who.

409
00:37:52,047 --> 00:37:55,073
I'm gonna nip that little prank
right in the bud.

410
00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:56,412
Where are you going?

411
00:37:56,485 --> 00:37:59,784
To that art gallery opening
we decided not to go to.

412
00:37:59,955 --> 00:38:01,980
Put dinner on a low flame.

413
00:38:03,292 --> 00:38:05,317
Don't forget the cilantro.

414
00:38:09,098 --> 00:38:12,431
Hello, Mrs. Moyer? This is Carol Anne.

415
00:38:15,138 --> 00:38:16,662
Is Donna there?

416
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,307
Are you sure?

417
00:38:21,344 --> 00:38:23,369
Okay, thank you.

418
00:38:38,462 --> 00:38:40,760
There's a camera in the hallway.

419
00:38:40,831 --> 00:38:43,561
We'll go in twos. I'll tell you when to go.

420
00:38:43,634 --> 00:38:46,797
Run under the camera
and stand against the door.

421
00:38:47,137 --> 00:38:48,468
You ready?

422
00:38:53,610 --> 00:38:54,634
Go!

423
00:39:02,754 --> 00:39:03,914
Ready?

424
00:39:18,002 --> 00:39:19,333
Get ready.

425
00:39:21,707 --> 00:39:22,969
Let's go.

426
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,542
Hurry up!

427
00:39:40,659 --> 00:39:44,652
Watch the camera. When the red light
goes off, go into the locker rooms.

428
00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:47,597
- There's always suits on the clotheslines.
- Who needs a suit?

429
00:39:47,667 --> 00:39:49,931
- You do!
- Come on.

430
00:41:14,223 --> 00:41:15,451
Come on.

431
00:41:16,726 --> 00:41:18,125
We need you.

432
00:41:36,981 --> 00:41:40,109
Sam, the stairway alarm just went off on 70.

433
00:41:40,651 --> 00:41:42,619
Anything on the monitor?

434
00:41:44,421 --> 00:41:47,219
It looks like that camera ain't working either.

435
00:41:47,291 --> 00:41:49,191
Better go check it out.

436
00:41:52,162 --> 00:41:53,151
Come on.

437
00:41:53,831 --> 00:41:58,461
You knock on the door, tell Burt
you saw some creepy guy walking on 67.

438
00:41:58,536 --> 00:42:00,970
As soon as he leaves, we'll go in.

439
00:42:01,706 --> 00:42:04,197
- He's coming out.
- Where's he going?

440
00:42:06,344 --> 00:42:09,211
- He just got in the elevator.
- Wait.

441
00:42:11,216 --> 00:42:12,740
Okay, let's go.

442
00:42:28,868 --> 00:42:30,733
What are you gonna do?

443
00:42:31,070 --> 00:42:33,197
Gonna run the videotape back two hours...

444
00:42:33,272 --> 00:42:35,840
then I'm going to change the monitor
from camera to VCR.

445
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:36,135
then I'm going to change the monitor
from camera to VCR.

446
00:42:36,207 --> 00:42:40,109
When he comes back in, he'll be watching
two hours of videotape on the monitor.

447
00:42:44,815 --> 00:42:47,716
- Okay, let's go.
- Have you got a key for that?

448
00:42:51,389 --> 00:42:53,755
- Yeah. Why?
- Beer.

449
00:42:54,392 --> 00:42:57,020
- I'm not going to steal...
- I got money.

450
00:43:01,766 --> 00:43:03,393
- No way.
- Yes.

451
00:43:37,837 --> 00:43:40,397
I'm your friend, Carol Anne.

452
00:44:06,667 --> 00:44:09,295
We need you to lead us into the light.

453
00:44:14,175 --> 00:44:16,075
Lead us into the light.

454
00:44:37,633 --> 00:44:38,861
Come on.

455
00:44:40,102 --> 00:44:41,364
Let's go.

456
00:44:55,017 --> 00:44:56,245
Come on.

457
00:45:16,272 --> 00:45:17,500
Come on.

458
00:45:25,615 --> 00:45:27,412
Want to see real panic?

459
00:45:33,491 --> 00:45:34,981
Pretty impressive.

460
00:45:37,728 --> 00:45:40,288
This is the police. We have you surrounded.

461
00:45:40,364 --> 00:45:43,492
Come out with your hands up
and your pants down!

462
00:45:45,169 --> 00:45:49,128
Hello, this is your camp director.
Jeff, quit pissing in the pool.

463
00:45:52,076 --> 00:45:54,476
Scott had a girl

464
00:45:54,813 --> 00:45:57,509
And Donna was her name

465
00:45:58,583 --> 00:46:01,484
Donna, Donna

466
00:46:10,128 --> 00:46:11,220
Shit!

467
00:46:19,439 --> 00:46:21,031
Don't be afraid.

468
00:46:22,542 --> 00:46:24,203
We won't harm you.

469
00:46:25,111 --> 00:46:26,510
We love you.

470
00:46:28,915 --> 00:46:30,906
You are the only angel...

471
00:46:31,617 --> 00:46:33,915
who can lead us into the light.

472
00:46:34,353 --> 00:46:36,321
We would never hurt you.

473
00:46:37,156 --> 00:46:38,316
Never!

474
00:46:38,925 --> 00:46:40,825
Don't run away from me.

475
00:46:43,930 --> 00:46:47,866
We need you, Carol Anne.
Lead us into the light.

476
00:47:10,424 --> 00:47:13,325
Help me! Let go of me! Help!

477
00:47:26,541 --> 00:47:29,066
Donna! Help!

478
00:47:29,144 --> 00:47:32,136
Help me! Donna! Quick!

479
00:47:36,451 --> 00:47:38,282
Holy shit!

480
00:47:38,354 --> 00:47:39,787
Donna, help!

481
00:47:45,928 --> 00:47:47,862
- Just hold on!
- Please help me!

482
00:47:48,531 --> 00:47:50,726
- Grab on to me!
- Donna, pull.

483
00:47:56,572 --> 00:47:59,302
- Pull her! I got her!
- Hang on!

484
00:48:01,343 --> 00:48:03,709
- Pull her! Hold on!
- Help me!

485
00:48:08,985 --> 00:48:10,452
Don't let go.

486
00:48:10,954 --> 00:48:13,081
- Hold on to her!
- Pull!

487
00:48:14,191 --> 00:48:16,523
- Pull!
- Hang on!

488
00:48:16,893 --> 00:48:18,121
Hold on.

489
00:48:53,397 --> 00:48:55,490
I love that! Love it! Yeah!

490
00:49:12,050 --> 00:49:14,280
Smoking more now and enjoying it less?

491
00:49:14,353 --> 00:49:16,514
Thinking more and enjoying it less.

492
00:49:16,588 --> 00:49:19,182
- There's something wrong.
- Tell me about it.

493
00:49:19,258 --> 00:49:22,352
Takamitsu offended
everyone he talked to tonight.

494
00:49:22,528 --> 00:49:25,053
Excuse me, Mr. Gardner. I just got a call.

495
00:49:25,131 --> 00:49:27,861
There's a bunch of kids
partying up in the pool...

496
00:49:27,934 --> 00:49:30,767
who claim they're guests of your daughter.

497
00:49:31,404 --> 00:49:32,735
Excuse me.

498
00:49:42,181 --> 00:49:46,618
Okay, so you all left the party together,
and they let you in here...

499
00:49:46,686 --> 00:49:49,951
went to the security room
to turn off the camera...

500
00:49:50,090 --> 00:49:54,083
- And then where did they go?
- I don't know where Scott and Donna went.

501
00:49:54,161 --> 00:49:56,994
We didn't hurt anything.
All we were doing was swimming.

502
00:49:57,064 --> 00:50:00,431
- Where was Carol Anne through all this?
- Not with us.

503
00:50:05,172 --> 00:50:07,834
Thanks, guys. Take the kids back to 56-E.

504
00:50:07,908 --> 00:50:11,435
- I'll talk with their parents later.
- Right, Mr. Gardner. Come on!

505
00:50:11,512 --> 00:50:14,504
My parents are going to ground me
till I'm 40.

506
00:50:14,649 --> 00:50:16,446
It'll give you time to study.

507
00:50:16,518 --> 00:50:19,783
You might get something
besides Auto Shop this year.

508
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:26,786
- They got Donna.
- Who's got Donna?

509
00:51:26,856 --> 00:51:30,451
- They got Donna and Carol Anne.
- Who's got Carol Anne?

510
00:51:30,526 --> 00:51:32,653
- They got them.
- Who, damn it?

511
00:51:39,603 --> 00:51:42,766
- What happened?
- He just came up through the ice.

512
00:51:43,908 --> 00:51:46,035
- What ice?
- The ice in the...

513
00:51:48,012 --> 00:51:49,104
pool.

514
00:51:53,350 --> 00:51:57,309
She's gotten to you, too.
It's a suggestion, Mr. Gardner.

515
00:51:57,855 --> 00:51:59,880
A posthypnotic suggestion.

516
00:52:00,292 --> 00:52:03,728
They got them. They got Donna,
and they got Carol Anne.

517
00:52:04,062 --> 00:52:06,758
They got them both. They've got them.

518
00:52:27,853 --> 00:52:31,118
Aunt Trish, help me!

519
00:52:41,667 --> 00:52:43,362
She's mine!

520
00:52:47,239 --> 00:52:49,173
Please help me.

521
00:52:49,241 --> 00:52:50,674
Help me!

522
00:52:53,180 --> 00:52:55,478
- Help me!
- Hang on, I'm pulling!

523
00:52:56,450 --> 00:52:57,678
Hang on.

524
00:53:07,461 --> 00:53:08,928
I've got you.

525
00:53:09,830 --> 00:53:11,195
Hold on!

526
00:53:11,665 --> 00:53:12,757
Help!

527
00:53:19,741 --> 00:53:22,232
Hold on, Carol Anne! We've got you!

528
00:53:22,577 --> 00:53:23,669
Pull!

529
00:53:27,148 --> 00:53:29,810
- Grab hold of her!
- I've got her.

530
00:53:29,884 --> 00:53:32,079
Pull! Don't let go!

531
00:53:37,925 --> 00:53:39,187
Get away!

532
00:53:42,597 --> 00:53:44,622
That's not Carol Anne!

533
00:53:45,734 --> 00:53:46,996
Damn you!

534
00:53:54,576 --> 00:53:55,907
Stay back.

535
00:53:56,945 --> 00:53:59,709
He's got the girls and now he wants you.

536
00:54:00,549 --> 00:54:03,643
- What are you talking about?
- The preacher Kane.

537
00:54:04,186 --> 00:54:07,417
He knows as long as there's someone
on this side that loves them...

538
00:54:07,489 --> 00:54:09,354
you can get them back.

539
00:54:09,692 --> 00:54:12,422
How did you know that wasn't Carol Anne?

540
00:54:13,463 --> 00:54:15,488
What surprised me, dear...

541
00:54:16,132 --> 00:54:17,861
is that you didn't.

542
00:54:20,437 --> 00:54:22,234
Who the hell are you?

543
00:54:24,407 --> 00:54:26,898
I'm one of your brother-in-law's...

544
00:54:27,477 --> 00:54:29,069
weirdo psychics.

545
00:54:32,315 --> 00:54:35,216
Carol Anne and Donna are not in that room.

546
00:54:38,589 --> 00:54:41,387
- Some goddamned thing is.
- Yes.

547
00:54:42,059 --> 00:54:44,857
Anger, rage...

548
00:54:45,930 --> 00:54:48,694
evil, they are in that room.

549
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:51,265
Can you feel the cold?

550
00:54:51,469 --> 00:54:55,166
He's devouring the heat, the energy.

551
00:54:56,340 --> 00:54:58,467
He's gathering his strength.

552
00:54:58,843 --> 00:55:02,142
We must find the girls
before he becomes too strong.

553
00:55:02,647 --> 00:55:05,912
If Donna and Carol Anne aren't in that room,
then where are they?

554
00:55:06,885 --> 00:55:08,409
The other side.

555
00:55:09,054 --> 00:55:13,548
Before we can find the girls,
we must find out where they entered.

556
00:55:15,527 --> 00:55:18,189
Where did Dr. Rasputin...

557
00:55:18,463 --> 00:55:19,828
take Scott?

558
00:55:21,867 --> 00:55:23,732
Excuse me, Dr. Seaton?

559
00:55:26,271 --> 00:55:27,602
Excuse us.

560
00:55:35,314 --> 00:55:37,282
Do your stuff.

561
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:49,692
I want you to look at the light.

562
00:55:51,264 --> 00:55:52,925
Look at the light.

563
00:56:07,381 --> 00:56:09,781
- Security.
- Burt, this is Gardner.

564
00:56:10,184 --> 00:56:13,745
Get your guys together. My daughter
and niece are roaming the building...

565
00:56:13,820 --> 00:56:17,017
and I'd like them found
as soon as possible, okay?

566
00:56:19,026 --> 00:56:20,118
What?

567
00:56:21,629 --> 00:56:22,857
Damn it!

568
00:56:23,998 --> 00:56:25,363
Yeah, okay.

569
00:56:27,435 --> 00:56:28,697
Terrific.

570
00:56:30,171 --> 00:56:33,334
First the heating,
then the electrical problems...

571
00:56:34,275 --> 00:56:36,300
now the security monitors.

572
00:56:38,146 --> 00:56:40,637
This is really happening, isn't it?

573
00:56:40,715 --> 00:56:43,206
Depends on who you want to believe.

574
00:56:46,755 --> 00:56:48,723
Tweedledum or Tweedle-dumber.

575
00:56:57,299 --> 00:56:59,995
You and Donna are at the swimming pool.

576
00:57:01,403 --> 00:57:02,927
You're leaving.

577
00:57:03,138 --> 00:57:04,901
Where are you going?

578
00:57:06,408 --> 00:57:08,069
The security room.

579
00:57:08,777 --> 00:57:11,177
We saw Carol Anne on the monitor.

580
00:57:11,981 --> 00:57:13,471
Which monitor?

581
00:57:14,384 --> 00:57:16,249
She was in the garage.

582
00:57:18,822 --> 00:57:20,187
The puddle!

583
00:57:21,258 --> 00:57:23,453
Hands came out of the puddle!

584
00:57:24,027 --> 00:57:26,120
They grabbed us, the hands!

585
00:57:27,464 --> 00:57:29,329
Keep her away from me!

586
00:57:36,706 --> 00:57:38,105
What puddle?

587
00:57:45,283 --> 00:57:46,773
In the garage.

588
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:17,275
They're between dimensions...

589
00:58:17,883 --> 00:58:19,680
behind reflections...

590
00:58:20,452 --> 00:58:22,943
behind mirrors, stealing images.

591
00:58:33,667 --> 00:58:34,998
The light!

592
00:58:38,038 --> 00:58:41,371
The light, it's so cold!

593
00:58:44,110 --> 00:58:45,577
Listen to me.

594
00:58:46,179 --> 00:58:48,170
Find your way back to your room.

595
00:58:48,248 --> 00:58:50,478
You must go back to your room.

596
00:58:51,785 --> 00:58:53,377
He won't let me!

597
00:58:53,820 --> 00:58:55,481
I'm so cold!

598
00:58:57,591 --> 00:59:00,754
Find Donna and go back to your room. Run!

599
00:59:00,828 --> 00:59:03,854
Enough. Stop this stupid sideshow.

600
00:59:04,832 --> 00:59:08,734
It's a great act. Carol Anne creates the fire,
and you feed it.

601
00:59:09,336 --> 00:59:11,133
You made this happen.

602
00:59:11,205 --> 00:59:14,663
You made her talk about him,
you made her remember him.

603
00:59:14,875 --> 00:59:17,810
He was lost. You brought him here.

604
00:59:18,412 --> 00:59:19,743
Ludicrous.

605
00:59:21,015 --> 00:59:22,744
It's your choice...

606
00:59:23,885 --> 00:59:25,477
Tweedledum...

607
00:59:25,887 --> 00:59:28,321
or Tweedle-dumber.

608
00:59:34,362 --> 00:59:36,091
Tell us what to do.

609
00:59:38,066 --> 00:59:41,194
Pray that Carol Anne heard me and listens.

610
00:59:41,837 --> 00:59:44,533
We must get up there as fast as we can.

611
00:59:47,542 --> 00:59:51,603
This is stupid, idiotic!
What's the matter with you people?

612
00:59:51,681 --> 00:59:53,876
Can't you see Carol Anne's behind this?

613
00:59:53,950 --> 00:59:57,249
She's making us believe this is happening.
It's all a hypnotic...

614
00:59:57,320 --> 00:59:58,810
That's as stupid and idiotic...

615
00:59:58,888 --> 01:00:01,516
as you hypnotizing that coffee cup
through the mirror.

616
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:18,039
That's good.

617
01:00:19,610 --> 01:00:21,510
He'll try to trick you.

618
01:00:21,912 --> 01:00:23,937
He'll try to separate you.

619
01:00:24,348 --> 01:00:25,838
Don't let him.

620
01:00:25,916 --> 01:00:28,214
Your love, your bond...

621
01:00:28,685 --> 01:00:33,384
your caring for these two children,
is our most valuable weapon.

622
01:00:42,433 --> 01:00:44,526
Let me take the chances.

623
01:00:46,304 --> 01:00:49,330
What's that? Some sort of mystical amulet?

624
01:00:49,741 --> 01:00:52,437
- A tool of your trade?
- It was a gift...

625
01:00:53,845 --> 01:00:55,608
from a good friend...

626
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:59,207
a powerful medicine man,
who walked among the spirits...

627
01:01:00,418 --> 01:01:01,976
and returned.

628
01:01:04,389 --> 01:01:06,118
There's power here.

629
01:01:07,091 --> 01:01:09,753
I only pray it is enough.

630
01:01:17,436 --> 01:01:20,234
Because Kane still thinks he needs her.

631
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:23,440
He was insane when he lived.

632
01:01:23,909 --> 01:01:27,276
And now, in death, that insanity...

633
01:01:27,980 --> 01:01:29,880
has become the beast.

634
01:01:30,416 --> 01:01:32,884
He wants Carol Anne now...

635
01:01:33,352 --> 01:01:35,115
before she grows up.

636
01:01:35,822 --> 01:01:38,382
Youth is a strong life force.

637
01:01:39,326 --> 01:01:42,261
Innocence is pure life force.

638
01:01:42,762 --> 01:01:46,425
We lose strength as we lose our innocence.

639
01:01:46,900 --> 01:01:50,734
You see, innocence is the only gift
we're given in life.

640
01:01:51,571 --> 01:01:54,335
All else must be fought for.

641
01:01:55,775 --> 01:01:58,767
In that gift is purity.

642
01:02:00,080 --> 01:02:02,173
In that purity...

643
01:02:02,650 --> 01:02:04,550
lies strength.

644
01:02:05,486 --> 01:02:08,387
- That's a lot of meaningless crap.
- Shut up.

645
01:02:21,402 --> 01:02:22,733
Unlock it.

646
01:02:31,413 --> 01:02:34,075
Can you spell "gorilla"?

647
01:02:35,317 --> 01:02:36,682
G-O...

648
01:02:37,953 --> 01:02:39,477
R-I...

649
01:02:40,389 --> 01:02:43,119
L-L-A.

650
01:02:44,226 --> 01:02:47,923
That is correct. Now try "pheasant. "

651
01:02:48,730 --> 01:02:50,163
Look at the mirror.

652
01:02:50,265 --> 01:02:52,256
...H- E...

653
01:02:52,734 --> 01:02:53,792
A...

654
01:02:54,637 --> 01:02:56,366
S-A...

655
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:59,431
N-T.

656
01:03:00,543 --> 01:03:04,673
That is correct. Can you spell "parakeet"?

657
01:03:07,016 --> 01:03:08,005
P...

658
01:03:09,552 --> 01:03:10,746
...R...

659
01:03:14,390 --> 01:03:18,121
Come back to this side, Carol Anne.
Come through the mirror.

660
01:03:19,997 --> 01:03:22,124
We want you to come join us.

661
01:03:23,500 --> 01:03:24,899
We miss you.

662
01:03:25,202 --> 01:03:27,727
You can come back through the mirror.

663
01:03:32,076 --> 01:03:35,239
Please come back through the mirror.

664
01:03:35,312 --> 01:03:37,837
Come back to this side, sweetie.

665
01:03:45,423 --> 01:03:48,324
Come to me, Carol Anne.
Don't be frightened.

666
01:03:49,661 --> 01:03:52,186
Don't be afraid, sweetie. Come to us.

667
01:03:53,365 --> 01:03:55,856
Won't you join us, Carol Anne?

668
01:04:09,180 --> 01:04:10,807
- Come here!
- No!

669
01:04:40,347 --> 01:04:43,908
Don't just stand there!
Get over here, for Christ's sake!

670
01:05:24,792 --> 01:05:27,022
I got you, baby. It's okay.

671
01:05:28,696 --> 01:05:29,822
Here you go.

672
01:05:34,436 --> 01:05:36,370
You're all right.

673
01:05:36,438 --> 01:05:38,565
- Where is she?
- Carol Anne is drowning!

674
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:40,232
- She's drowning!
- Where?

675
01:05:43,478 --> 01:05:44,843
You're safe now.

676
01:05:45,914 --> 01:05:47,006
Where?

677
01:05:48,049 --> 01:05:51,485
- She's drowning!
- What does it matter anymore?

678
01:05:51,553 --> 01:05:53,646
Who the hell goddamn cares?

679
01:05:54,156 --> 01:05:55,248
Baby.

680
01:05:56,159 --> 01:05:58,093
Take care of her for a minute.

681
01:06:02,198 --> 01:06:03,597
It's okay.

682
01:06:03,866 --> 01:06:05,766
Carol Anne's drowning!

683
01:06:06,836 --> 01:06:10,795
- You got to get a hold of yourself.
- I can't deal with this anymore.

684
01:06:11,174 --> 01:06:14,007
I love you and Donna. That's our family.

685
01:06:14,744 --> 01:06:16,234
Let's get out of here.

686
01:06:16,312 --> 01:06:19,145
- Let Dr. Seaton deal with Carol Anne.
- She's your niece.

687
01:06:19,215 --> 01:06:20,341
I don't care.

688
01:06:20,416 --> 01:06:23,442
I can't take these sick little games anymore.

689
01:06:23,787 --> 01:06:27,314
I never should have let Steven and Diane
send her to us.

690
01:06:29,459 --> 01:06:30,721
Bruce, please!

691
01:06:53,218 --> 01:06:54,276
Dad!

692
01:06:55,787 --> 01:06:57,084
Relax, Donna.

693
01:06:58,823 --> 01:07:00,222
You're safe.

694
01:07:00,525 --> 01:07:02,823
You're just having a bad dream.

695
01:07:03,695 --> 01:07:05,890
We're all having a bad dream.

696
01:07:07,465 --> 01:07:09,695
Where's my dad? I want my dad.

697
01:07:10,201 --> 01:07:11,930
Lie here and relax.

698
01:07:12,670 --> 01:07:14,467
I'll go get your dad.

699
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:29,080
Hello?

700
01:09:47,064 --> 01:09:48,964
And they thought I was her.

701
01:10:44,791 --> 01:10:46,088
I saw her.

702
01:10:46,159 --> 01:10:48,957
- You think you saw her.
- I saw her, damn it!

703
01:10:49,462 --> 01:10:52,488
Your daughter's upstairs,
a shivering, emotional wreck.

704
01:10:52,565 --> 01:10:56,001
Then you run out on me
to chase after that evil little brat again.

705
01:10:56,069 --> 01:10:59,004
Don't you understand?
Don't you see what she's doing?

706
01:10:59,072 --> 01:11:00,733
It's just like Dr. Seaton said.

707
01:11:00,807 --> 01:11:04,072
Nothing Seaton said
explains what happened tonight.

708
01:11:07,013 --> 01:11:08,241
Come on.

709
01:11:20,494 --> 01:11:22,894
The man, he grabbed my hand!

710
01:12:16,085 --> 01:12:18,178
Remember what Tangina said.

711
01:12:51,354 --> 01:12:52,446
Open!

712
01:13:03,968 --> 01:13:05,868
Help us!

713
01:13:16,013 --> 01:13:17,207
Oh, God!

714
01:13:26,592 --> 01:13:29,083
Outside in!

715
01:13:32,131 --> 01:13:34,395
Help us!

716
01:13:38,704 --> 01:13:41,298
Outside in!

717
01:14:05,765 --> 01:14:07,733
Tangina gave this to me.

718
01:14:10,270 --> 01:14:12,033
She gave this to us!

719
01:14:14,208 --> 01:14:17,302
She's trying to save us.
She's trying to bring us through this.

720
01:14:17,378 --> 01:14:20,609
- It's a lie. It's not true, any of this!
- No, baby.

721
01:14:20,681 --> 01:14:22,239
It's not true! You're a liar!

722
01:14:22,316 --> 01:14:24,944
None of this is true! You're a liar!

723
01:14:25,019 --> 01:14:28,921
She's trying to get us through.
She's trying to save our lives.

724
01:14:28,989 --> 01:14:30,456
Just hold on.

725
01:14:32,927 --> 01:14:34,656
Just hold on, baby.

726
01:15:33,424 --> 01:15:34,584
No!

727
01:15:40,498 --> 01:15:41,897
Who are you?

728
01:15:48,005 --> 01:15:50,769
- What do you want?
- You!

729
01:18:01,744 --> 01:18:03,609
It's not cold anymore.

730
01:18:04,747 --> 01:18:06,374
She said we could do it!

731
01:18:06,448 --> 01:18:09,576
She said we could beat them!
It's over, baby.

732
01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:11,719
It's over, darling!

733
01:18:11,788 --> 01:18:14,586
- I want to believe that.
- Believe it!

734
01:18:17,494 --> 01:18:20,429
It's finished, and we did it together.

735
01:18:42,687 --> 01:18:44,086
Look at you.

736
01:18:44,789 --> 01:18:47,223
You two are pitiful. You know what?

737
01:18:47,291 --> 01:18:50,590
No, I don't want to know.
I understand these things.

738
01:18:50,728 --> 01:18:53,822
Anyway, everybody went home.
And it went fine. I locked up.

739
01:18:53,898 --> 01:18:57,527
You two can read about it tomorrow
in the society columns.

740
01:18:58,502 --> 01:18:59,969
Newlyweds.

741
01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:05,672
Donna's been looking for you. She called.
She and Carol Anne are with that shrink...

742
01:19:05,744 --> 01:19:09,373
what's-his-name from the school.
You ought to talk to him.

743
01:19:09,448 --> 01:19:12,815
He's probably never met anybody
with a garage fetish.

744
01:19:13,952 --> 01:19:15,442
Mañana, y'all.

745
01:19:35,641 --> 01:19:38,474
Mr. And Mrs. Stanley, how are you tonight?

746
01:19:39,012 --> 01:19:41,480
I did some plumbing.
Sorry for the inconvenience.

747
01:19:41,547 --> 01:19:43,777
What inconvenience?
We didn't have a problem.

748
01:19:43,850 --> 01:19:45,909
If there was a problem, I'm sorry.

749
01:19:45,985 --> 01:19:48,545
But the hot water's gonna be on very soon.

750
01:19:51,657 --> 01:19:54,285
I had to say something. I mean, look at us.

751
01:19:54,895 --> 01:19:57,420
I didn't get much use
out of last year's salary.

752
01:19:57,498 --> 01:19:59,363
I think you look great wet.

753
01:19:59,433 --> 01:20:02,869
- You can lie like that anytime you want to.
- I usually do.

754
01:20:02,936 --> 01:20:04,130
I know.

755
01:20:05,672 --> 01:20:09,233
I can't wait to get upstairs,
stretch out in bed...

756
01:20:09,910 --> 01:20:11,275
and act normal.

757
01:20:11,779 --> 01:20:15,237
- Getting upstairs sounds great.
- What have you got in mind?

758
01:20:15,315 --> 01:20:17,647
Packing everything
that belongs to that brat...

759
01:20:17,718 --> 01:20:20,152
and sending her home to my sister.

760
01:20:23,224 --> 01:20:24,987
It wasn't her fault.

761
01:20:26,928 --> 01:20:28,361
Yes, it is!

762
01:23:03,924 --> 01:23:05,118
Oh, my God!

763
01:23:15,035 --> 01:23:16,696
- Outside in!
- What?

764
01:23:16,836 --> 01:23:19,828
Damn it! Outside in.
That's what Tangina said.

765
01:23:20,207 --> 01:23:24,940
He controls the inside, but not the outside!
We can still get to him. Come on.

766
01:24:07,222 --> 01:24:08,814
Don't look down.

767
01:25:57,770 --> 01:25:59,533
All right, hold onto this.

768
01:25:59,606 --> 01:26:02,200
No matter what happens, don't let go.

769
01:26:17,457 --> 01:26:19,357
Fucking son of a bitch!

770
01:26:54,129 --> 01:26:55,528
Go away!

771
01:26:56,365 --> 01:26:58,993
He doesn't want them! He only wants me!

772
01:26:59,535 --> 01:27:02,527
You don't love me. You don't want me here!

773
01:27:02,604 --> 01:27:06,199
My parents don't love me, either!
They sent me away!

774
01:27:06,909 --> 01:27:09,173
Kane loves me! Kane wants me!

775
01:27:09,812 --> 01:27:14,078
Give me Tangina's necklace,
and you can have Bruce and Donna back.

776
01:27:14,817 --> 01:27:16,580
They're your family.

777
01:27:17,019 --> 01:27:18,714
I'll go with Kane.

778
01:27:18,922 --> 01:27:21,117
Your mom and dad do love you!

779
01:27:21,958 --> 01:27:23,858
They love you very much.

780
01:27:24,928 --> 01:27:26,691
And I love you, too!

781
01:27:26,930 --> 01:27:30,457
It's hard for me to show it sometimes,
but I do love you!

782
01:27:30,533 --> 01:27:32,023
Save your family!

783
01:27:32,101 --> 01:27:34,865
They're the ones who
mean something to you, not me.

784
01:27:34,938 --> 01:27:36,530
That's not true!

785
01:27:37,273 --> 01:27:39,400
You are part of my family!

786
01:27:40,577 --> 01:27:43,375
You and Donna are like my children!

787
01:27:44,615 --> 01:27:48,073
I love you, and I'll do anything to prove that!

788
01:27:48,152 --> 01:27:49,813
You've got to believe me!

789
01:27:49,887 --> 01:27:51,616
No! Go away!

790
01:27:53,023 --> 01:27:54,251
Go away!

791
01:29:28,155 --> 01:29:29,213
God!

792
01:29:34,796 --> 01:29:36,559
Where are you, Kane?

793
01:29:36,831 --> 01:29:39,129
Where have you taken my family?

794
01:29:39,767 --> 01:29:41,394
I want them back!

795
01:29:42,770 --> 01:29:44,965
Tangina said you can't take them...

796
01:29:45,039 --> 01:29:47,530
as long as someone here loves them.

797
01:29:49,110 --> 01:29:50,509
I love them.

798
01:29:52,013 --> 01:29:55,414
And I have this to protect me.

799
01:30:15,270 --> 01:30:17,067
The necklace!

800
01:30:24,781 --> 01:30:26,578
Give me the necklace!

801
01:30:27,150 --> 01:30:28,174
No.

802
01:30:28,685 --> 01:30:30,152
The necklace!

803
01:30:35,892 --> 01:30:36,950
Oh, God!

804
01:31:09,694 --> 01:31:11,685
Give her back her family.

805
01:31:12,897 --> 01:31:14,762
You don't need them!

806
01:31:14,833 --> 01:31:16,960
You don't need Carol Anne!

807
01:31:17,035 --> 01:31:19,265
I can lead you into the light!

808
01:31:20,405 --> 01:31:24,364
I have the knowledge and the power!

809
01:31:39,992 --> 01:31:42,517
No! Tangina, don't!

810
01:31:42,795 --> 01:31:46,424
Tell me how to use the necklace
so I can save all of you.

811
01:31:46,566 --> 01:31:48,090
Thank you, Pat.

812
01:31:48,267 --> 01:31:50,667
But this is the way it has to be.

813
01:31:51,471 --> 01:31:53,962
Say goodbye to Carol Anne for me.

814
01:31:54,607 --> 01:31:57,440
Tell her I'll always love her...

815
01:31:58,911 --> 01:32:01,880
and that her nightmare is over.

816
01:32:17,765 --> 01:32:19,255
Tangina, wait!

817
01:32:22,236 --> 01:32:23,760
Where are they?

818
01:33:33,710 --> 01:33:35,075
She did it.

819
01:33:36,847 --> 01:33:38,314
She saved us.

820
01:33:56,000 --> 01:34:00,099
