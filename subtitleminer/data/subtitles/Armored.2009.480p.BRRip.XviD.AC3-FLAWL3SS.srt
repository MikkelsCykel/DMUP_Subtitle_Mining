1
00:01:26,853 --> 00:01:30,220
Rise and shine. Let's go.
Gonna miss the bus. Get up.

2
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:31,982
Please stop acting like Dad.

3
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:36,019
Boy, I don't got time for this.
Get up. I'm gonna be late.

4
00:01:36,196 --> 00:01:38,164
Your lunch is in the kitchen.

5
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:26,912
Come on, man.

6
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:40,888
<i>Negative on that, Control.
We're short-handed already.</i>

7
00:03:03,216 --> 00:03:07,380
Now, that's what I'm talking about.
M4 Benelli scattergun.

8
00:03:07,554 --> 00:03:09,749
State of the art.
Blah!

9
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:12,882
Yeah, boys.

10
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:17,489
I wish somebody would mess with us
on the... What?

11
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:20,964
Looks like the devil made that.

12
00:03:21,668 --> 00:03:23,829
Cut the shit, Palmer.

13
00:03:24,437 --> 00:03:27,668
You and the devil was real tight
not too long ago, huh?

14
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:30,606
God saved my life, yes,

15
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:33,436
and he could still save yours.

16
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:36,374
- What's up?
- Good morning.

17
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:39,814
Good morning.
Yo, yo, little Mike.

18
00:03:40,486 --> 00:03:41,714
Check this baby out.

19
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:44,416
What do you think of that?

20
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:46,354
Looks like you're overcompensating.

21
00:03:47,927 --> 00:03:49,189
What are you talking about?

22
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:51,626
- What am I talking about?
- What you talking about?

23
00:03:51,798 --> 00:03:55,928
You know what they say. Bigger
the gun, smaller the, uh, pistol.

24
00:03:59,339 --> 00:04:01,603
Okay, okay. Good one,
good one, good one.

25
00:04:01,774 --> 00:04:05,210
Oh, you know. Shit, I'm gonna
remember that shit. That's all right.

26
00:04:05,378 --> 00:04:08,836
Next Monday,
Teams 1, 3, 5 and 7

27
00:04:09,015 --> 00:04:13,611
will commence training
on the new 425X 7 ACTs.

28
00:04:13,786 --> 00:04:17,654
Ladies and gentlemen,
we are entering the modern age.

29
00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:21,726
All new trucks
will be equipped with GPS.

30
00:04:21,894 --> 00:04:24,385
This is mandatory training,

31
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:27,697
and I will accept no excuses.

32
00:04:27,867 --> 00:04:29,425
No hall passes.

33
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,470
<i>Uh, ten-four, Control.</i>

34
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:16,578
<i>Eagle Shield 32,
check in on your next job.</i>

35
00:05:17,884 --> 00:05:19,784
<i>Yeah, Eagle Shield 32.</i>

36
00:05:19,952 --> 00:05:24,150
<i>Yeah, we're, uh, 10-5 on that drop.</i>

37
00:05:27,393 --> 00:05:29,588
<i>Twenty minutes, 32.</i>

38
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:32,256
<i>Yeah, 10-4, thanks.</i>

39
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:38,229
<i>Your next scheduled check-in after
drop will be in 30 minutes. Stand by.</i>

40
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:45,268
<i>Eagle 24, we're 2400 block,
uh, Madison.</i>

41
00:05:47,313 --> 00:05:50,441
<i>Two-four, stand by.
Tow is en route to, uh, 24.</i>

42
00:05:57,156 --> 00:05:58,282
What's going on?

43
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:01,154
I got a black van.
He circled us twice.

44
00:06:03,262 --> 00:06:05,753
All right, eyes and ears open.

45
00:06:05,998 --> 00:06:07,659
<i>Ten-four.</i>

46
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:13,263
I wish they would
try something.

47
00:07:02,855 --> 00:07:04,379
Whoa, whoa,
what's going on?

48
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:11,453
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

49
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:13,098
Ty, keep your eyes open.

50
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:20,094
- I don't know. She just cut out on me.
- Check your gauges.

51
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,534
Everything looks good.

52
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:25,836
Hey, wait, whoa, whoa.

53
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:27,775
You smell that?
Anybody smell that?

54
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:30,939
Sm... Smell... Smell what?
I don't smell nothing, Baines.

55
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:35,144
I smell it. Burnt sugar.
Somebody got to the fuel line.

56
00:07:35,321 --> 00:07:37,118
No, no, this ain't good, man.
- Team 12 to Base.

57
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,019
This ain't good.
Team 12 to Base, come in.

58
00:07:40,426 --> 00:07:41,723
Keep keying that thing.
Keep keying it.

59
00:07:41,894 --> 00:07:44,328
Team 12 to Base, come in,
goddamn it. Where are you?

60
00:07:44,497 --> 00:07:47,193
- We got a code black here.
- Come on. What's going on?

61
00:07:47,366 --> 00:07:50,335
- Keep keying the thing.
- I am, I am, I'm trying.

62
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:53,105
Come on.

63
00:07:53,406 --> 00:07:54,998
Team 12 to Base, come in.

64
00:07:55,174 --> 00:07:57,165
Where the hell are you?
We got a code black.

65
00:07:57,343 --> 00:07:59,140
- We're in a dead zone.
- Damn.

66
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:02,679
Holy shit.

67
00:08:03,115 --> 00:08:06,414
Holy shit, holy shit. Holy shit!

68
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:10,683
- My seat belt's stuck.
- Hit the deep locks.

69
00:08:10,857 --> 00:08:12,347
My seat belt's stuck.

70
00:08:14,126 --> 00:08:16,651
Keep keying it! Keep keying it!
She won't turn over!

71
00:08:19,298 --> 00:08:20,788
Bomb!

72
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:22,935
Baines, come on.

73
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:27,798
Come on.

74
00:08:27,974 --> 00:08:29,805
She won't turn over.
She won't turn over!

75
00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:44,280
I can't take it.
- "Bomb!"

76
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:47,119
- We got you, man.
- We got you, man.

77
00:08:47,293 --> 00:08:48,988
We got you.

78
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:51,853
Oh, buddy, you did great.

79
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:54,727
- You were quiet in the crisis, man.
- Jesus.

80
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,899
Oh, no, can't get his belt off!

81
00:09:05,845 --> 00:09:08,370
You should have seen
the look on your face.

82
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:11,540
Don't worry. Dobbsie was crying
when we did it to him.

83
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:13,548
No, no, no. Don't... Don't...

84
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:16,620
We had to change your diaper,
Dobbsie. What the hell...?

85
00:09:16,789 --> 00:09:18,222
Hey, hey, hey.

86
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:20,484
I tried to stop them,
bro, all right?

87
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,252
You're supposed to have my back.

88
00:09:22,428 --> 00:09:24,658
Hold on. Hold on.

89
00:09:25,531 --> 00:09:28,056
I got something I'd like to say.

90
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:29,929
Hold on a second.

91
00:09:31,003 --> 00:09:34,837
You know, when your old man
asked me to be your godfather,

92
00:09:35,007 --> 00:09:37,305
that was a big moment in my life.

93
00:09:37,476 --> 00:09:41,378
He was a great mentor to me

94
00:09:41,547 --> 00:09:44,778
and he was...
He was my best friend.

95
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:49,384
I don't know how much of this
he expressed to you,

96
00:09:49,555 --> 00:09:53,286
how deeply proud he was of you
when you joined the service.

97
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:58,394
And I know both he and your mom
would be proud

98
00:09:58,564 --> 00:10:03,433
to see the way that you stepped up
for your brother, Jimmy.

99
00:10:03,669 --> 00:10:06,103
Real proud.
- Yeah.

100
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:07,796
And I'm proud of you too.

101
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:13,043
So let's take a moment
to lift up our glasses to Ty.

102
00:10:13,412 --> 00:10:15,107
To Ty, Jr.
- To Ty.

103
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:17,306
- Ty.
- Ty.

104
00:10:17,483 --> 00:10:19,383
You passed your probation.

105
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:20,951
Starting tomorrow,

106
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,556
you're a full-fledged guard
with Eagle Shield Security.

107
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:26,954
To Eagle Shield.
- Eagle Shield!

108
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:28,954
Eagle Shield Security.

109
00:10:30,162 --> 00:10:32,062
Ty
Here's to it.

110
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:36,868
They dropped a power line
on the truck.

111
00:10:37,236 --> 00:10:38,897
Fifty thousand volts.

112
00:10:39,071 --> 00:10:41,232
Fried everybody inside.

113
00:10:41,741 --> 00:10:44,175
They were lucky they went fast.

114
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:47,041
- Remember Omaha?
- Oh, man.

115
00:10:47,213 --> 00:10:50,011
Yeah, they tried to use a
demolition charge to blow the door.

116
00:10:50,182 --> 00:10:52,241
The door held,

117
00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:54,477
but the fuel tank
went up in flames.

118
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:57,145
They were cooked alive.

119
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:00,918
So has Eagle Shield
ever got jacked?

120
00:11:01,093 --> 00:11:05,029
Once. A couple of guards
got killed in a five-man ambush.

121
00:11:05,865 --> 00:11:07,264
How much they get?

122
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:12,200
Not one dollar. The last guard
in the crew dropped all five of them.

123
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:14,931
One guard?
Yes.

124
00:11:15,307 --> 00:11:16,365
Ashcroft.

125
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:19,810
Ashcroft? Our Ashcroft?

126
00:11:19,979 --> 00:11:22,504
- That's why he's got the cane.
- No.

127
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:25,708
Still carrying a couple
of slugs in his back.

128
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:29,582
I got an even better one.
Back in October of '88,

129
00:11:29,755 --> 00:11:33,213
a crew making a $4-million
cash transfer to Abilene

130
00:11:33,592 --> 00:11:35,423
stopped at a car accident.

131
00:11:35,594 --> 00:11:38,859
Only it wasn't an accident,
it was a setup.

132
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:42,728
The guard who got out of the truck,
well, they just grabbed him,

133
00:11:42,902 --> 00:11:45,735
put a sawed-off shotgun
to the back of his head.

134
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:48,203
Then what happened?

135
00:11:48,507 --> 00:11:52,671
Crew just gave up the money
and they let the guard go.

136
00:11:52,845 --> 00:11:54,437
The guards just gave up the money?

137
00:11:54,613 --> 00:11:58,515
It was either that
or sacrifice one of their brothers.

138
00:11:59,351 --> 00:12:01,046
The funny thing about it is,

139
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:04,189
they still never caught up
with those hijackers.

140
00:12:04,356 --> 00:12:06,324
- Right?
- Nope.

141
00:12:07,093 --> 00:12:09,687
And they never
found that money either.

142
00:12:11,163 --> 00:12:12,824
See,

143
00:12:12,998 --> 00:12:15,796
not everybody's a hero,
soldier boy.

144
00:12:22,441 --> 00:12:24,875
So when are you gonna tell us
about all them kills

145
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:27,444
you got over there
in Baghdad?

146
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:30,405
We'd like to hear about that.

147
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,047
I gotta take a leak.

148
00:12:40,226 --> 00:12:42,217
You're out of line, man.

149
00:12:58,911 --> 00:13:01,903
You should be proud
of what you did over there.

150
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:06,943
I'm not.

151
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,551
A lot of innocent people
died out there.

152
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:15,024
Right, right. But you were just trying
to protect the guys in your unit.

153
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:19,395
Those guys were
your brothers.

154
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:22,862
Anybody would've done
the same thing.

155
00:13:25,604 --> 00:13:29,472
So you'd think.
That's what you'd think.

156
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:36,839
We're not gonna let the bank
take your house.

157
00:13:37,016 --> 00:13:40,281
- I got that under control.
- Hey, don't bullshit me, Ty.

158
00:13:41,587 --> 00:13:44,021
Don't worry about it.
We're gonna think of something.

159
00:13:50,229 --> 00:13:51,753
All right.

160
00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:53,523
Say hi to Jimmy.

161
00:13:54,733 --> 00:13:57,065
- Drive safe, man.
- All right.

162
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,911
Jimmy.

163
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:19,814
Jimmy?

164
00:14:23,162 --> 00:14:24,629
Jimmy, let's eat.

165
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:38,167
Jimmy.

166
00:14:40,579 --> 00:14:42,206
Jimmy!

167
00:14:45,117 --> 00:14:48,382
What are you doing? Huh?

168
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:51,751
Your bedroom is one thing.
You know this is the kitchen, right?

169
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:56,026
What's for dinner?

170
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:59,060
I'm starved.

171
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:00,896
"I'm starved."

172
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:03,758
You're really
testing me, bro.

173
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,571
Every day.

174
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:16,181
- Every day, it's something with you.
- What took you so long?

175
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,577
What took...? No, Jimmy.

176
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:20,514
Where'd you get
the supplies?

177
00:15:20,686 --> 00:15:24,213
You ain't getting no money from me,
so where are you getting it, Jimmy?

178
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:28,190
You better not be stealing it from
the store. Where'd you get them?

179
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,227
No, man. I'm not stealing them
from the store.

180
00:15:31,397 --> 00:15:33,490
Okay, tell me something.

181
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:37,960
But school has a real nice supply.

182
00:15:40,906 --> 00:15:42,567
School.

183
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:47,302
Boy.

184
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:52,145
At least you're going to school, man.

185
00:15:56,221 --> 00:15:57,711
In the kitchen.

186
00:15:59,758 --> 00:16:03,216
Remember how Dad
used to always freak Mom out

187
00:16:03,395 --> 00:16:05,022
and tell her all those stories?

188
00:16:05,197 --> 00:16:06,664
Yeah, I remember.

189
00:16:06,832 --> 00:16:09,892
Like there was an owl
living in the attic.

190
00:16:10,736 --> 00:16:12,863
There was an owl up there.

191
00:16:16,175 --> 00:16:17,540
- Come on.
- What?

192
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:20,611
- A real owl?
- A real owl.

193
00:16:28,053 --> 00:16:29,486
You think it's gone too?

194
00:16:35,794 --> 00:16:37,625
You got skills, man.

195
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:41,165
Thanks.

196
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:47,798
All right, listen up.

197
00:16:49,074 --> 00:16:50,974
One more thing.

198
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,808
As I was getting the collections
together for Freddy's widow,

199
00:16:58,584 --> 00:17:00,279
I found this.

200
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:05,616
"For a good time, call 555-0125."

201
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:16,058
You're sick, Baines. You need help.

202
00:17:16,935 --> 00:17:19,335
How you know it was me?
Did you call the number, chief?

203
00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:25,842
I can't believe you let your sister
marry this pig.

204
00:17:26,011 --> 00:17:27,979
She was always bringing home strays.

205
00:17:28,147 --> 00:17:31,207
You know, maybe she's got
a thing for sick animals.

206
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:32,407
Ooh.

207
00:17:32,584 --> 00:17:33,608
That's you,
that's you.

208
00:17:33,786 --> 00:17:36,050
All right, settle down, settle down.

209
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:38,052
Tomorrow begins the CCD cycle,

210
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:41,386
so if you can't be here on time,
be early.

211
00:17:43,595 --> 00:17:47,224
And I expect each of you to pay
extra special attention to detail.

212
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:50,835
Half our ACTs will be carrying
HC priority loads.

213
00:17:51,003 --> 00:17:52,868
Yeah, I got his priority load.

214
00:17:55,674 --> 00:17:56,834
All right, keep your eyes

215
00:17:57,009 --> 00:17:59,204
open out there.
Open out there.

216
00:18:08,887 --> 00:18:11,981
- Hey, you got a second, Top?
- What is it, Hackett?

217
00:18:14,026 --> 00:18:17,291
Hey, I was wondering if you could,
uh, throw a few more shifts my way.

218
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:23,030
Yeah, I know. I know it's a problem.
But I just need some help, man.

219
00:18:23,202 --> 00:18:26,228
Getting letters from the bank,
some real ugly letters.

220
00:18:27,072 --> 00:18:30,269
I'm sorry, kid.
Not enough to go around.

221
00:18:32,578 --> 00:18:34,671
All right. Thanks, Top.

222
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:54,560
Eagle 12 to Control.

223
00:18:55,534 --> 00:18:57,468
<i>We're code five and en route.</i>

224
00:18:57,636 --> 00:19:00,696
Copy, Truck 12.
Next radio check-in in 15 minutes.

225
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:02,568
<i>Eagle 12, out.</i>

226
00:19:06,211 --> 00:19:08,304
I think I know what happened
to that money.

227
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:12,379
The Abilene job.

228
00:19:12,851 --> 00:19:15,342
They never caught those guys
because they don't exist.

229
00:19:17,389 --> 00:19:19,914
Crew hid the 4 million.

230
00:19:20,592 --> 00:19:23,925
And then they just made up
that story about getting jacked.

231
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:27,293
Hide the money, fake being jacked.
That's classic.

232
00:19:27,466 --> 00:19:29,297
That's pretty good, huh?

233
00:19:29,468 --> 00:19:31,834
The only thing is,
they made one big mistake.

234
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,130
What's that?

235
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:36,270
They didn't take enough.

236
00:19:43,649 --> 00:19:44,707
This is the bank.

237
00:19:46,218 --> 00:19:47,845
What?

238
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,545
It's trying to take the house.

239
00:20:04,002 --> 00:20:08,200
You know, the more things change,
the more they stay the same.

240
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:11,936
Shit, I don't know what that means.
Well,

241
00:20:12,744 --> 00:20:17,078
your dad worked two jobs,
barely made ends meet, right?

242
00:20:17,649 --> 00:20:21,346
And then, God bless them,
but he and your mother die,

243
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,614
and they leave you with
a house with two mortgages

244
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:27,054
and a pile of hospital bills.

245
00:20:27,793 --> 00:20:30,125
That's not what they wanted for you.

246
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:32,520
They wanted you to
get out of this place

247
00:20:32,698 --> 00:20:35,360
and have the life
that they never had.

248
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:37,725
And now look at you.

249
00:20:38,637 --> 00:20:40,366
Here you are
in the same old shit.

250
00:20:44,509 --> 00:20:46,773
Guys like your old man
used to bust their hump

251
00:20:46,945 --> 00:20:49,277
working in places like this.

252
00:20:51,183 --> 00:20:53,981
Then you go off to Iraq,
you serve your country,

253
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:56,583
and you earn a Silver Star.

254
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:58,484
For what?

255
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:06,056
Don't get me started.

256
00:21:09,034 --> 00:21:11,270
Come on,
let's get something to eat.

257
00:21:15,507 --> 00:21:17,998
Hey, kid, I'd get you another one,
but you usually stop at four.

258
00:21:18,176 --> 00:21:19,643
Thanks, Joe.
Take another Coke.

259
00:21:19,811 --> 00:21:21,335
- You got it.
- Thanks.

260
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:28,946
You really love them, don't you?

261
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:33,280
My father used to take me
to ball games when I was a kid.

262
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:35,517
We'd put away four
of those things apiece.

263
00:21:35,694 --> 00:21:37,457
Every time I eat those, I'm...

264
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:38,687
<i>Any available unit,</i>

265
00:21:38,864 --> 00:21:42,265
<i>we have reported gunshots in
the vicinity of Franklin and Durango.</i>

266
00:21:42,434 --> 00:21:44,459
<i>- Unit 8, show en route.
- Ten-four, 8.</i>

267
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:46,103
Thanks, Joe.
Get me next time.

268
00:21:46,271 --> 00:21:47,636
I'II get you this time.

269
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:49,932
You be safe.

270
00:22:08,727 --> 00:22:12,219
This is one spot in the old 'hood
that's gonna be here forever.

271
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:15,326
- Hey, Joe.
- What's up, Joe?

272
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,401
Two regulars, one with cheese.

273
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:21,164
And get me another one to go.
Another one to go.

274
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,932
- For Jimmy.
- Thanks, man.

275
00:22:23,108 --> 00:22:24,973
How's he doing?

276
00:22:26,611 --> 00:22:28,772
Driving me crazy.

277
00:22:29,047 --> 00:22:31,447
- It's hard for him, you know?
- Yeah.

278
00:22:32,417 --> 00:22:34,078
I hear you.

279
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:40,982
You know,

280
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:44,586
I really appreciate
everything you do, man.

281
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:49,224
- What, are you kidding me?
- Well, you do a lot, man.

282
00:22:50,068 --> 00:22:51,933
You're like family to me, man.

283
00:22:52,104 --> 00:22:55,665
You and Jimmy. You'II
always be family to me.

284
00:22:58,777 --> 00:23:00,677
I'm really
starting to feel it, Mike.

285
00:23:02,514 --> 00:23:06,143
The whole damn world, bro.
Pwooh.

286
00:23:10,021 --> 00:23:12,489
Have you talked to Jimmy
about the situation?

287
00:23:12,657 --> 00:23:17,356
He knows the bank wants the house,
but he thinks I'II figure it out.

288
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:22,397
- Good dog, Joe.
- Thanks.

289
00:23:22,701 --> 00:23:24,328
Listen.

290
00:23:25,504 --> 00:23:26,528
Let's take a walk.

291
00:23:26,705 --> 00:23:29,333
There's something I've been
meaning to talk to you about.

292
00:23:29,508 --> 00:23:31,999
Thanks, Joe.
All right. See you around.

293
00:23:35,981 --> 00:23:39,382
Tomorrow's the start
of a new CCD cycle.

294
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:41,750
It only happens twice a year.

295
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:45,822
Yeah, I heard this morning.
"Can't be on time, be early."

296
00:23:46,224 --> 00:23:47,486
Yeah.

297
00:23:47,659 --> 00:23:52,153
The banks will be looking
to crown their vault reserves,

298
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:56,461
which means we're gonna be transporting
something in the neighborhood of

299
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:58,998
42 million.

300
00:23:59,171 --> 00:24:02,698
Damn.
That's a lot of money.

301
00:24:03,074 --> 00:24:05,065
Damn straight.

302
00:24:05,644 --> 00:24:07,509
So...

303
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:11,180
So think about it.

304
00:24:13,218 --> 00:24:15,186
Think we might get jacked?

305
00:24:15,353 --> 00:24:17,412
As a matter of fact, I do.

306
00:24:18,056 --> 00:24:20,718
We're gonna take that money, Ty.

307
00:24:20,892 --> 00:24:24,259
You, me, Baines, Quinn,
Palmer and Dobbs.

308
00:24:24,429 --> 00:24:25,453
What?

309
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:28,030
It's gonna be just like
the Abilene job,

310
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,431
only we don't make
the same mistake they did.

311
00:24:31,603 --> 00:24:33,400
We're going big.

312
00:24:34,506 --> 00:24:36,133
Come on.

313
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:39,072
What, you think last week
was a joke?

314
00:24:39,244 --> 00:24:40,939
It was a test run.

315
00:24:41,112 --> 00:24:44,639
Because that's exactly the way
this robbery's gonna play out.

316
00:24:44,916 --> 00:24:47,544
It's our alibi.
We stash the money

317
00:24:49,054 --> 00:24:51,045
and we tell them we got jacked.

318
00:24:52,457 --> 00:24:55,915
You're planning
to yank $42 million?

319
00:24:56,094 --> 00:24:59,586
No. We're planning
on yanking $42 million.

320
00:24:59,764 --> 00:25:01,288
Because I need you in this.

321
00:25:01,466 --> 00:25:04,629
- Are you crazy?
- It's gonna work. Think about it.

322
00:25:04,803 --> 00:25:08,295
- The cops are gonna be all over you.
- Forget the cops.

323
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:11,404
Of course they're gonna be
all over us in the beginning.

324
00:25:11,576 --> 00:25:15,569
But we got a rock-solid alibi,
and all we gotta do is stick with it.

325
00:25:15,747 --> 00:25:18,045
- The trucks, Mike.
- We're gonna torch the trucks.

326
00:25:18,216 --> 00:25:20,013
- There's gonna be no evidence left.
- "We're gonna torch the trucks"?

327
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:22,813
- Are you listening to yourself, Mike?
- Ty, it's clean.

328
00:25:22,988 --> 00:25:24,478
It's clean.

329
00:25:24,656 --> 00:25:26,487
Come on, man.
There's no bad guys.

330
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:29,960
Look, there's just us.
Nobody's gonna get hurt.

331
00:25:30,262 --> 00:25:31,286
Think about it.

332
00:25:31,463 --> 00:25:33,727
There's nothing to think
about. I'm not doing it.

333
00:25:33,899 --> 00:25:36,891
- All right.
- Me and Jimmy, we gonna be all right.

334
00:25:37,302 --> 00:25:40,567
Look, look, I understand. You're
a little bit worked up about this.

335
00:25:40,739 --> 00:25:45,039
I don't blame you. It's a
little last-minute, I understand.

336
00:25:47,012 --> 00:25:50,379
I want you to go home, sleep on it.

337
00:25:50,916 --> 00:25:54,818
And if you want in,
be at the bus stop in the morning.

338
00:25:55,287 --> 00:25:57,016
I won't be there.

339
00:25:57,188 --> 00:25:59,088
- All right. Where you going?
- I'm walking.

340
00:25:59,257 --> 00:26:01,919
- I'll drive you.
- I need the fresh air.

341
00:26:02,093 --> 00:26:04,425
Ty, come on.

342
00:26:04,663 --> 00:26:07,393
Promise me you're gonna think about it.

343
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:09,431
Ty!

344
00:26:12,938 --> 00:26:14,929
Come on, man.

345
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:16,967
Look.

346
00:26:18,944 --> 00:26:23,472
All right, I know
I can trust you with this.

347
00:26:23,648 --> 00:26:25,616
Hm?

348
00:27:36,554 --> 00:27:38,078
Ty.

349
00:27:38,256 --> 00:27:41,282
This lady came here to see you.
She's from Child Welfare.

350
00:27:41,459 --> 00:27:43,086
Sir, are you
Mr. Tyler Hackett?

351
00:27:43,261 --> 00:27:45,821
Child Welfare, Ty.
- Yeah, yeah, wait, wait, wait.

352
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:47,259
What's going on?
What's going on?

353
00:27:47,432 --> 00:27:49,866
I kept telling her
we ain't on no damn welfare,

354
00:27:50,035 --> 00:27:51,502
but she didn't wanna listen.

355
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:54,798
And I've tried to explain
it's not that kind of welfare.

356
00:27:54,973 --> 00:27:57,806
It's Child Supervision and Services.
Whatever, lady. Whatever.

357
00:27:57,976 --> 00:28:00,570
My brother got a job, okay?
We don't need no welfare.

358
00:28:00,745 --> 00:28:02,645
Jimmy, shut up!

359
00:28:04,783 --> 00:28:06,648
Okay?

360
00:28:08,486 --> 00:28:09,510
Come in.

361
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:10,848
In the past 10 months,

362
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:13,889
during the little time
he's actually appeared at school,

363
00:28:14,059 --> 00:28:17,517
James has had two suspensions,
four arrests.

364
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:20,859
For tagging.
He's artsy.

365
00:28:23,435 --> 00:28:25,596
Look at that.
Tell me that's not art.

366
00:28:29,808 --> 00:28:32,743
Okay. Come on, lady.

367
00:28:33,845 --> 00:28:35,813
He's a good kid.

368
00:28:36,781 --> 00:28:39,011
When I was his age,
I was hot-wiring cars.

369
00:28:40,685 --> 00:28:42,209
Okay.

370
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:43,820
That came out wrong.

371
00:28:43,988 --> 00:28:45,819
Your brother's school
has notified us

372
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:49,448
he's missed more days
than he's attended this year.

373
00:28:49,961 --> 00:28:52,429
What's she talking about, Jimmy?

374
00:28:53,098 --> 00:28:55,498
I asked you a question, boy.

375
00:28:58,703 --> 00:29:01,501
I was looking for a job
so we could keep the house.

376
00:29:01,673 --> 00:29:02,833
You're losing your house,
Mr. Hackett?

377
00:29:03,007 --> 00:29:04,838
No, we're not
losing the house.

378
00:29:05,009 --> 00:29:08,069
You have to understand, Mr. Hackett, if
James doesn't have the proper lodging...

379
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:10,305
I didn't know he was missing school.

380
00:29:11,216 --> 00:29:13,878
As a result, the Department
of Child Welfare

381
00:29:14,052 --> 00:29:16,816
is legally obligated
to intervene on James' behalf

382
00:29:16,988 --> 00:29:20,082
to determine if he's a candidate
for state-funded care.

383
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:22,552
Foster care.

384
00:29:24,028 --> 00:29:26,963
No, foster care,
that must be a mistake.

385
00:29:27,132 --> 00:29:29,828
I'm Jimmy's legal guardian.
I take care of him.

386
00:29:31,636 --> 00:29:33,763
Okay, all right.

387
00:29:34,672 --> 00:29:36,264
I admit it's been tough.

388
00:29:37,509 --> 00:29:42,037
He lost both...
We lost both our parents this year.

389
00:29:43,248 --> 00:29:47,207
- I understand, Mr. Hackett...
- Nobody's splitting us up, lady.

390
00:29:48,486 --> 00:29:51,717
He's my brother. You
know what that means, huh?

391
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:55,587
I'm all he's got. He's all I got.

392
00:29:59,697 --> 00:30:01,824
Nobody's splitting us up.

393
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:04,457
Period.

394
00:31:42,634 --> 00:31:44,864
No one gets hurt, right?

395
00:31:46,938 --> 00:31:48,462
How?

396
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:51,098
There's no bad guys.

397
00:31:51,276 --> 00:31:52,834
Only good guys.

398
00:31:56,714 --> 00:31:58,739
Jimmy needs me.

399
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:02,011
I cannot go to jail.

400
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:05,184
You hear me?

401
00:32:06,691 --> 00:32:08,921
No more blood on my hands.

402
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:14,895
Promise me nobody gets hurt.

403
00:32:15,967 --> 00:32:18,902
Nobody gets hurt. That's a promise.

404
00:33:01,713 --> 00:33:02,941
Hackett,
hold up a minute.

405
00:33:10,221 --> 00:33:11,449
Came in today.

406
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:15,281
It's official, kid. Now
you've got the tin to prove it.

407
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:19,627
I want you to know it's an honor
having a decorated veteran on my crew.

408
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,559
I mean that.

409
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:26,761
Come on, let's roll out.

410
00:34:32,503 --> 00:34:34,130
Gentlemen.

411
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:50,512
<i>Courtesy transport 3489.
Copy that.</i>

412
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,234
- Reserves, Federal Reserve Bank.
- It's fine.

413
00:35:54,118 --> 00:35:55,745
Yeah, that's right, that's right.
We all done?

414
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,080
Yeah.
All right.

415
00:35:57,255 --> 00:35:58,779
All right, gentlemen.

416
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:02,183
All right.

417
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:04,521
We're all good.
Let's roll out.

418
00:36:50,341 --> 00:36:52,434
It's time to check in.

419
00:36:59,317 --> 00:37:01,148
Eagle 12, Control.

420
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:04,149
Go ahead, 12.

421
00:37:04,522 --> 00:37:06,649
Twelve is, uh...

422
00:37:09,493 --> 00:37:10,926
<i>Code five.</i>

423
00:37:14,799 --> 00:37:16,699
Code five.

424
00:37:17,368 --> 00:37:21,429
Situation normal. We're on
Jefferson headed back to the barn.

425
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:23,870
<i>Copy, 12.</i>

426
00:37:24,842 --> 00:37:27,902
Next check-in
in 58 minutes.

427
00:37:28,813 --> 00:37:31,907
Copy that. Eagle 12, out.

428
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,364
Whoo!

429
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:41,443
That's beautiful.
- See what I mean?

430
00:39:41,612 --> 00:39:43,807
You smell that?
- Yes. The smell of freedom.

431
00:39:43,981 --> 00:39:46,074
No. Smells like ours.

432
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:49,014
Baines, stop that. You want
the cops smelling booze on you?

433
00:39:49,186 --> 00:39:51,677
- Come on, put it away. Put it away.
- Okay, okay, okay.

434
00:39:51,856 --> 00:39:53,915
All right, look,
we got 51 minutes

435
00:39:54,091 --> 00:39:57,060
to stash this money and then
get jacked. Let's go. Come on.

436
00:39:57,361 --> 00:39:58,385
Come on.

437
00:40:00,331 --> 00:40:03,061
Take that gear off. I got a
job for you. Let's go. Let's go.

438
00:40:03,801 --> 00:40:05,268
Whoo!

439
00:40:05,436 --> 00:40:06,869
Now is not
the time to pray.

440
00:40:08,606 --> 00:40:11,006
Come on, Hackett.
All right, keep it moving.

441
00:40:11,175 --> 00:40:13,735
Come on, come on, come on.
Keep it moving.

442
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:14,935
That's it.

443
00:40:15,112 --> 00:40:18,275
Put the money in these bags.
Put them in the hole, all right?

444
00:40:18,449 --> 00:40:20,974
Keep it moving. Let's go.

445
00:40:21,152 --> 00:40:23,882
Come on, guys.
Let's move, let's move.

446
00:40:24,054 --> 00:40:25,248
All right, let's go.

447
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:28,324
Keep it coming. Come on.
Ohh, all this money.

448
00:40:30,995 --> 00:40:33,429
Yeah, yeah. Come on.

449
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:37,831
Here it comes, here it comes.

450
00:40:38,002 --> 00:40:40,095
Come on, come on.
All right, keep it coming.

451
00:40:51,148 --> 00:40:54,948
That's it. This one's empty.
All right.

452
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:57,178
Last one, let's go.

453
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:07,424
Someone's here.

454
00:41:47,037 --> 00:41:48,698
Easy, Grandpa.

455
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:52,104
Easy.

456
00:42:01,385 --> 00:42:03,353
Mike. Mike. Mike.

457
00:42:06,423 --> 00:42:09,187
Wait, wait. Wait one sec.
Let's just put the money back.

458
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,850
I don't like this, Mike.
Shit!

459
00:42:11,028 --> 00:42:12,586
Everybody, okay, let's stay calm.

460
00:42:12,763 --> 00:42:14,890
He saw our faces, man!
- We let him go!

461
00:42:15,065 --> 00:42:16,965
He saw our freaking faces, man!

462
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:23,904
Shit.
Are you out of your mind?

463
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:33,611
Hey, calm down!
Calm down right now!

464
00:42:34,618 --> 00:42:37,109
Jesus Christ!
- Are you all right?

465
00:42:38,322 --> 00:42:41,052
Come on, chief. You wanna go?
Just calm down.

466
00:42:41,592 --> 00:42:43,025
Let him go.

467
00:42:43,193 --> 00:42:44,387
Let him go.
You're crazy.

468
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:46,826
Come on! Come on, chief!
- Ty, where you going?

469
00:42:47,598 --> 00:42:50,032
Ty, he's not gonna make it.

470
00:42:50,501 --> 00:42:51,832
Ty, stop!

471
00:43:06,951 --> 00:43:08,179
I had to do it.

472
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:12,722
I had no choice.

473
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,250
I do.

474
00:43:18,929 --> 00:43:20,294
No, you don't.

475
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:22,827
Mike.

476
00:43:32,209 --> 00:43:33,267
Come on, Ty.

477
00:43:34,178 --> 00:43:35,736
Open up.

478
00:43:35,913 --> 00:43:37,403
We gotta figure this thing out.

479
00:43:37,581 --> 00:43:40,482
You just shot that...
You just killed that man.

480
00:43:40,651 --> 00:43:42,915
He was gonna die
before you got him to a hospital.

481
00:43:43,087 --> 00:43:44,520
You don't know that.
You don't know that!

482
00:43:44,688 --> 00:43:46,815
Yes, I do, and so do you.

483
00:43:46,991 --> 00:43:50,483
Look. Ty, he was gonna
land us in jail anyway.

484
00:43:50,661 --> 00:43:52,561
Don't you understand?

485
00:43:52,796 --> 00:43:57,130
Ty, open this door so we can figure
this thing out together like a team.

486
00:43:57,301 --> 00:44:00,498
You just want me to
walk out there, huh?

487
00:44:00,671 --> 00:44:02,161
Baines just tried to kill me!

488
00:44:02,339 --> 00:44:04,534
Forget Baines.
I'II deal with Baines, I promise.

489
00:44:04,708 --> 00:44:08,337
- Your promises don't mean shit.
- Look, I admit Baines screwed up.

490
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:11,280
You're absolutely right about that.

491
00:44:11,582 --> 00:44:14,642
But I didn't want us
to all go down for his mistake.

492
00:44:16,286 --> 00:44:17,685
We gotta clean this up.

493
00:44:17,855 --> 00:44:21,621
If we keep our cool,
this thing could still work.

494
00:44:24,361 --> 00:44:26,261
Think about Jimmy.

495
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:28,789
He needs you.

496
00:44:31,702 --> 00:44:33,260
Control?

497
00:44:35,005 --> 00:44:37,530
Control, Eagle 12, this is Eagle...

498
00:44:39,943 --> 00:44:42,810
Come on, Ty. Come on,
we can still make this work.

499
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:45,814
Open the door.

500
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:48,277
Open this door!

501
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:23,367
- Hear that, Joe?
- Hear what?

502
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:35,481
Pop the hood.

503
00:47:44,962 --> 00:47:47,624
Get out of the truck. Come on.

504
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:58,440
We're dead, man.
No, it's gonna be okay.

505
00:47:58,609 --> 00:48:00,338
Just be cool, Dobbs.
We stick to the plan, we're okay.

506
00:48:00,510 --> 00:48:03,138
Oh, stick to the plan? Was shooting
that guy part of the plan, Baines?

507
00:48:03,313 --> 00:48:05,474
Stop whining.
Huh? Was it?

508
00:48:06,984 --> 00:48:08,645
Maybe he's right, we should leave.

509
00:48:08,819 --> 00:48:10,309
And go where?
I don't know.

510
00:48:10,487 --> 00:48:13,615
You guys can sit here and you can
wait for the cops. I am done.

511
00:48:13,790 --> 00:48:16,816
- You're not going anywhere.
- Dobbs is right.

512
00:48:18,128 --> 00:48:21,393
In 40 minutes, when we fail
to check in with Ashcroft,

513
00:48:21,565 --> 00:48:24,193
this whole area
is gonna be crawling with cops.

514
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:31,170
Here's what we can do. We can
forget about the money in my truck

515
00:48:31,708 --> 00:48:35,303
and take the 21 mil from Quinn's
truck and split it up five ways.

516
00:48:35,479 --> 00:48:36,673
Still a lot of money.

517
00:48:36,847 --> 00:48:40,112
It's a lot of money. But then what?

518
00:48:40,517 --> 00:48:42,849
Cat's out of the bag now.

519
00:48:44,121 --> 00:48:47,022
This changes everything.
Well, what do we do?

520
00:48:47,190 --> 00:48:49,351
Yeah, what do you wanna do, Mike?

521
00:48:53,163 --> 00:48:54,494
We get the kid out of the truck.

522
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:57,400
How?

523
00:48:57,668 --> 00:49:00,159
The hinges.
Hinges?

524
00:49:00,804 --> 00:49:03,602
Those hinges are
tempered steel.

525
00:49:03,774 --> 00:49:05,002
Yeah, but the pins aren't.

526
00:49:05,175 --> 00:49:09,805
If we can drive the pins through,
the hinges will come undone.

527
00:49:10,113 --> 00:49:12,206
We got less than 40 minutes
to do this.

528
00:49:12,416 --> 00:49:15,010
And then what?
- And then,

529
00:49:16,086 --> 00:49:18,281
when the cops arrive,

530
00:49:18,855 --> 00:49:22,723
we tell them that Ty died
saving our lives.

531
00:49:24,394 --> 00:49:26,624
That he died a hero.
That'II work.

532
00:49:29,933 --> 00:49:31,730
All you had to do was open the door.

533
00:49:35,372 --> 00:49:39,172
Come on, let's get something
to open this goddamn hinge.

534
00:49:47,451 --> 00:49:49,817
I would've protected you.

535
00:50:28,392 --> 00:50:30,485
- Ah!
- Jesus!

536
00:50:32,796 --> 00:50:34,923
All right, well, let's go.
We got 36 minutes.

537
00:50:57,020 --> 00:50:58,681
<i>Eagle 24, what's your 10-20?</i>

538
00:50:58,855 --> 00:51:03,053
Request for 500,000 CTO
from WLH Trust.

539
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:09,426
- Hold for 12 and 17.
- You got it, boss.

540
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:11,567
They're due in 30.

541
00:51:19,543 --> 00:51:21,670
- Come on, give it to me.
- Okay.

542
00:51:21,845 --> 00:51:23,904
All right, you and me. Let's go.

543
00:51:52,075 --> 00:51:54,873
Mike. Come on,
this is taking too long.

544
00:51:55,812 --> 00:51:58,872
- You got a better idea?
- Keep going.

545
00:52:09,626 --> 00:52:11,287
Dobbs.

546
00:52:13,230 --> 00:52:14,891
Dobbs.

547
00:52:26,843 --> 00:52:28,435
What?

548
00:52:28,645 --> 00:52:30,613
Help me, man.

549
00:52:32,349 --> 00:52:34,283
I can't.

550
00:52:34,551 --> 00:52:38,715
- You should've stuck with us.
- Come on, Dobbs.

551
00:52:40,557 --> 00:52:42,024
We're not murderers.

552
00:53:01,945 --> 00:53:05,472
Just help me out, man.
You gotta help me out.

553
00:53:07,484 --> 00:53:09,076
No.

554
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:11,453
No, I don't.

555
00:53:21,331 --> 00:53:23,526
- Gonna come out now, soldier boy?
- What the hell are you doing?

556
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:25,565
What's it
look like I'm doing?

557
00:53:27,037 --> 00:53:29,096
Hey, come on, Baines.

558
00:53:30,473 --> 00:53:32,031
Are you out of your mind?

559
00:53:33,410 --> 00:53:35,105
You want some?

560
00:53:35,278 --> 00:53:36,836
Come on.

561
00:53:37,581 --> 00:53:38,741
Hey!

562
00:53:38,915 --> 00:53:40,177
Hey! Hey!

563
00:53:40,350 --> 00:53:42,113
Let him go! Come on!

564
00:53:45,021 --> 00:53:46,352
Come on!

565
00:53:46,523 --> 00:53:48,320
Come on! Come on! Come on!

566
00:53:52,095 --> 00:53:55,531
Goddamn it! You broke my tooth,
you damn moron.

567
00:53:56,099 --> 00:53:57,566
Next time I'II break your head.

568
00:53:57,734 --> 00:54:00,259
You burn the truck,
you burn the money, you idiot.

569
00:54:00,437 --> 00:54:03,099
I'm gonna tell your sister
you called me that.

570
00:54:28,932 --> 00:54:31,264
Unit 8 to Dispatch.

571
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:36,697
Dispatch.

572
00:55:03,833 --> 00:55:04,891
Sorry.

573
00:55:06,670 --> 00:55:08,831
Okay, keep going.

574
00:55:24,921 --> 00:55:27,685
Cops! There's a cop car coming.

575
00:55:49,379 --> 00:55:51,472
He stopped.
I can take care of it.

576
00:55:51,648 --> 00:55:54,947
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
No, he's not here for us.

577
00:55:55,118 --> 00:55:58,451
Don't do anything stupid.
I'm gonna get rid of him.

578
00:55:59,889 --> 00:56:01,481
Hey there.
Hey!

579
00:56:01,658 --> 00:56:05,389
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey. I'm a good guy. I'm a good guy.

580
00:56:05,595 --> 00:56:07,324
Is everything okay?

581
00:56:07,497 --> 00:56:11,433
- What are you doing here?
- I'm a security guard. Yeah.

582
00:56:11,601 --> 00:56:14,866
Yeah, I also do
some maintenance work as well.

583
00:56:15,038 --> 00:56:17,768
Yeah. Is everything okay?

584
00:56:19,142 --> 00:56:20,905
I thought I heard a siren.

585
00:56:21,978 --> 00:56:26,472
Siren? No, no sirens here. At
least to the best of my knowledge.

586
00:56:26,816 --> 00:56:29,410
What do they need security
at an abandoned building for?

587
00:56:29,886 --> 00:56:32,081
Well, it's for insurance purposes.

588
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:34,120
They've got vagrants
running around here.

589
00:56:34,391 --> 00:56:38,191
They're stealing copper
and just stripping the place clean.

590
00:56:38,695 --> 00:56:40,754
It's really terrible.

591
00:56:41,297 --> 00:56:42,764
I heard some banging too.

592
00:56:42,932 --> 00:56:46,095
Oh. Where?

593
00:56:46,436 --> 00:56:48,427
Couldn't tell you where from.

594
00:56:53,643 --> 00:56:56,009
Well, I've had to chase them
out of here numerous times.

595
00:56:56,179 --> 00:56:59,876
They're mostly bums, but if one of them
gets hurt, the owner's still liable.

596
00:57:00,583 --> 00:57:03,450
- Everybody wants a piece of the pie.
- Yeah.

597
00:57:04,854 --> 00:57:06,344
So, uh,

598
00:57:06,523 --> 00:57:09,959
there's nothing over here
in this particular unit.

599
00:57:10,126 --> 00:57:11,991
Sounded like it was
coming from in there.

600
00:57:12,162 --> 00:57:16,326
Yeah, I just came from in there
and I, uh, didn't see anything.

601
00:57:16,499 --> 00:57:19,024
Of course, I don't like
going in there much, you know.

602
00:57:19,202 --> 00:57:22,729
I can show you around, but you
might wanna cover your nose.

603
00:57:22,906 --> 00:57:24,305
Why's that?

604
00:57:24,474 --> 00:57:26,339
An old dog crawled in there
and died.

605
00:57:30,847 --> 00:57:34,544
The rats have eaten most of him, but the
stench is so bad, it'II make you puke.

606
00:57:34,717 --> 00:57:39,017
They've got these rats,
they're the size of a big old fat cat.

607
00:57:39,589 --> 00:57:41,420
Come on in, I'II show you the dog.

608
00:57:41,591 --> 00:57:43,559
- I'II take your word for it.
- You sure?

609
00:57:43,726 --> 00:57:45,125
Yeah.

610
00:57:48,064 --> 00:57:50,055
Well, thanks for stopping by.

611
00:57:50,233 --> 00:57:52,758
If I hear anything,
I'II be sure to let you know.

612
00:58:13,656 --> 00:58:16,056
Come on. Help me get him inside.

613
00:58:26,936 --> 00:58:29,427
Should've never trusted you.
He was coming inside!

614
00:58:29,606 --> 00:58:30,937
He heard the siren!

615
00:58:31,107 --> 00:58:33,701
What was I supposed to do?
Damn it.

616
00:58:36,179 --> 00:58:37,305
What the hell was that?

617
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:40,415
I didn't know what else to do!
What else did you want me to do?

618
00:58:40,583 --> 00:58:42,517
He was coming inside! Damn it!

619
00:58:42,685 --> 00:58:44,243
Come on.

620
00:58:46,189 --> 00:58:48,419
No, no, no!

621
00:58:51,928 --> 00:58:53,657
What the hell is wrong with you?

622
00:58:53,830 --> 00:58:56,355
Well, what was I supposed to do?
He was coming inside!

623
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,399
He was coming inside!

624
00:59:00,470 --> 00:59:02,438
Oh, shit.

625
00:59:13,483 --> 00:59:15,747
Don't look at me like that.

626
00:59:15,919 --> 00:59:18,387
- What did you want me to do?
- You did this, man. You did this.

627
00:59:18,555 --> 00:59:21,285
Yeah, yeah, he's alive.
Move your head!

628
00:59:22,725 --> 00:59:24,693
What's going on?
I don't know.

629
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:32,390
Fuck!

630
00:59:33,937 --> 00:59:35,063
No!

631
00:59:35,238 --> 00:59:37,672
No, no, no.

632
00:59:41,277 --> 00:59:44,110
Oh, no. Oh, no, no, no.

633
01:00:03,132 --> 01:00:05,123
Okay, okay, okay, hang on.

634
01:00:05,301 --> 01:00:07,064
God. What's happening to me?

635
01:00:07,236 --> 01:00:09,727
You're just going into shock.
Okay? All right.

636
01:00:12,408 --> 01:00:13,534
I need you to stay with me.

637
01:00:13,710 --> 01:00:15,200
What's happening to me?

638
01:00:32,729 --> 01:00:34,287
Okay, okay, all right.

639
01:00:34,464 --> 01:00:36,295
Just look at me, look at me,
look at me.

640
01:00:36,466 --> 01:00:38,991
Okay, I need you to breathe.
Breathe, breathe.

641
01:00:39,402 --> 01:00:41,734
There we go. Slow and steady.
That's better.

642
01:00:41,904 --> 01:00:44,498
I'm gonna have to clean this up and
stop the bleeding. All right? Okay.

643
01:00:46,609 --> 01:00:48,304
Fuck!

644
01:00:57,453 --> 01:00:59,148
All right.

645
01:00:59,422 --> 01:01:00,446
I got an idea.

646
01:01:00,623 --> 01:01:03,251
Pressure, pressure, pressure.
Keep pressure on the wound.

647
01:01:03,426 --> 01:01:06,953
Can you do that, huh?
Can you hear me? All right. All right.

648
01:01:07,296 --> 01:01:09,856
Okay, I'm gonna call...
I'm gonna call in and report you.

649
01:01:10,299 --> 01:01:12,597
Officer down. Officer down.

650
01:01:21,077 --> 01:01:23,602
Okay, all right.
We just stop the bleeding,

651
01:01:23,780 --> 01:01:26,476
we can wait this out.
Me and you. Okay?

652
01:01:26,649 --> 01:01:28,879
You're not dying today. Okay.

653
01:01:39,162 --> 01:01:40,459
What's your name, man?

654
01:01:41,431 --> 01:01:43,626
Eckehart.
Jake Eckehart.

655
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:46,030
Jake. How long
until your backup comes?

656
01:01:46,235 --> 01:01:47,668
I don't know, an hour maybe.

657
01:01:47,837 --> 01:01:49,862
There was a glitch.
I'm bleeding again, man.

658
01:01:51,340 --> 01:01:53,240
I know, I know. Keep pressure
on it, keep pressure on it.

659
01:01:53,409 --> 01:01:55,070
- Okay? All right?
- Okay.

660
01:01:55,244 --> 01:01:56,472
You gotta breathe, though.

661
01:01:56,946 --> 01:02:00,746
Breathe. The more you
breathe, the less it hurts.

662
01:02:18,668 --> 01:02:20,568
Come on, Palmer.

663
01:02:21,604 --> 01:02:23,629
You watch my hand.

664
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:32,801
Ty?

665
01:03:34,577 --> 01:03:36,044
Ty?

666
01:03:40,216 --> 01:03:41,808
Ty?

667
01:03:42,852 --> 01:03:44,479
Are you home?

668
01:03:48,157 --> 01:03:49,784
Ty?

669
01:03:52,028 --> 01:03:53,552
Ty?

670
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:12,079
Is he still alive?

671
01:04:12,248 --> 01:04:15,615
He's not gonna be
if we don't get help soon.

672
01:04:16,752 --> 01:04:18,686
Okay, listen to me.

673
01:04:18,888 --> 01:04:21,880
Cochrane pulled the main fuse
from the engine.

674
01:04:22,425 --> 01:04:23,517
It's in his coat pocket.

675
01:04:24,594 --> 01:04:27,062
- I'm scared, Ty.
- Dobbs.

676
01:04:27,697 --> 01:04:29,062
I need you to get it.

677
01:04:29,966 --> 01:04:32,400
It's our only way out of here.

678
01:04:34,103 --> 01:04:36,071
Get it, Dobbs.

679
01:04:36,672 --> 01:04:37,832
Get it.

680
01:04:49,986 --> 01:04:51,010
He's doing it.

681
01:04:52,221 --> 01:04:56,487
He's doing it.
Nice. Nice and easy now.

682
01:05:58,654 --> 01:06:01,054
I don't know what we're doing here

683
01:06:01,691 --> 01:06:04,683
- anymore, man.
- I know.

684
01:06:05,695 --> 01:06:08,858
This is not what we agreed to,
Mike. I mean...

685
01:06:11,067 --> 01:06:12,728
Palmer.

686
01:06:12,902 --> 01:06:15,996
Don't let them do anything to me,
man, please?

687
01:06:19,442 --> 01:06:21,137
I won't.

688
01:06:26,248 --> 01:06:28,011
Okay.

689
01:06:28,951 --> 01:06:31,920
Okay. All right, man.

690
01:06:55,878 --> 01:06:56,936
I'm sorry, man.

691
01:06:57,113 --> 01:06:58,273
- It's okay.
- I'm sorry.

692
01:06:58,447 --> 01:07:00,381
- It's okay.
- I can't do it.

693
01:07:00,549 --> 01:07:02,642
- I know, I know. I know.
- I can't do it.

694
01:07:02,818 --> 01:07:04,683
I just wanna go home.

695
01:07:04,854 --> 01:07:08,290
I wanna go home, man.
I wanna see my kid and...

696
01:07:09,125 --> 01:07:11,821
- It's gonna be okay.
- I'm sorry, man. I'm really sorry.

697
01:07:37,620 --> 01:07:40,018
No one was
supposed to get hurt.

698
01:07:42,358 --> 01:07:43,916
I'm gonna bleed to death.

699
01:08:10,252 --> 01:08:12,686
- I need your radio.
- It's right here.

700
01:08:14,590 --> 01:08:16,785
- What are you doing?
- I'm getting us some cover.

701
01:08:26,068 --> 01:08:27,797
Hey, Palmer.

702
01:08:31,240 --> 01:08:33,731
Palmer. Hold up.

703
01:08:37,012 --> 01:08:39,537
Palmer? You with us?

704
01:08:39,715 --> 01:08:42,240
Let's go. Get back to work.

705
01:08:55,297 --> 01:08:56,321
What are you doing?

706
01:08:56,499 --> 01:09:00,629
They can't see us, they don't
know what we're doing. Right?

707
01:09:03,806 --> 01:09:05,706
- You with me? You with me?
- Yeah.

708
01:09:05,875 --> 01:09:08,435
- All right. Hang tight, hang tight.
- Yeah.

709
01:09:33,769 --> 01:09:35,202
Hurry up.

710
01:09:35,771 --> 01:09:38,968
Keep talking. Keep breathing.

711
01:09:40,643 --> 01:09:43,544
- Talk to me, talk to me.
- I'm fine. I'm all right.

712
01:10:07,403 --> 01:10:09,030
Yeah. Yeah.

713
01:10:33,095 --> 01:10:36,258
Okay. I'm going up to the roof.
I'm gonna try to get a signal.

714
01:10:36,432 --> 01:10:39,060
Okay? You just keep pressure
on that thing. I'II be back.

715
01:10:39,235 --> 01:10:40,634
Why would you come back?

716
01:10:42,771 --> 01:10:45,535
Because I'm the reason
you're in this mess, Jake.

717
01:10:46,976 --> 01:10:49,672
- Just stay put.
- Yeah.

718
01:12:41,023 --> 01:12:42,115
Come on.

719
01:12:47,162 --> 01:12:49,653
Shh.

720
01:12:53,702 --> 01:12:56,899
I think I heard something.
What?

721
01:12:58,474 --> 01:12:59,998
Palmer.

722
01:13:00,175 --> 01:13:02,143
Go check it out.

723
01:13:13,822 --> 01:13:15,557
Let's go.

724
01:13:43,652 --> 01:13:44,846
Come on.

725
01:13:45,020 --> 01:13:47,011
<i>Unit 8, what's your 20?</i>

726
01:13:47,189 --> 01:13:49,851
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we have...
We have an officer down.

727
01:13:50,025 --> 01:13:52,585
We have an officer down.
I need help.

728
01:13:52,761 --> 01:13:54,228
<i>What is your location?</i>

729
01:13:54,396 --> 01:13:56,057
Uh...

730
01:13:56,231 --> 01:13:59,564
We're at the Steele...
Steele Industry Center.

731
01:13:59,735 --> 01:14:02,226
<i>- State your name, please.
- Just...</i>

732
01:14:02,404 --> 01:14:04,269
Just get here, please.

733
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:06,806
<i>Units en route, code three.</i>

734
01:14:11,580 --> 01:14:13,138
It's done.

735
01:14:15,517 --> 01:14:17,178
It's over.

736
01:14:17,786 --> 01:14:19,617
You stupid kid.

737
01:14:19,788 --> 01:14:22,052
Just put the gun down.

738
01:14:22,624 --> 01:14:23,716
Okay?

739
01:14:24,193 --> 01:14:28,960
Don't make it... Don't make it
worse. Just put the gun down.

740
01:14:29,331 --> 01:14:31,822
Why couldn't you just go along?

741
01:14:32,935 --> 01:14:35,130
Palmer, listen to me, just...

742
01:14:35,537 --> 01:14:37,437
Just put the gun down.

743
01:14:37,739 --> 01:14:39,707
Okay, okay.

744
01:14:39,908 --> 01:14:41,876
- You didn't hurt anybody.
- Shut up!

745
01:14:42,044 --> 01:14:43,671
Shut your fucking mouth!

746
01:14:44,446 --> 01:14:46,107
Okay.

747
01:14:47,115 --> 01:14:49,675
You don't know a thing.

748
01:14:52,688 --> 01:14:55,748
You don't want...
You don't wanna do this.

749
01:14:57,059 --> 01:14:58,686
You don't wanna do this.

750
01:15:00,529 --> 01:15:01,553
Just put the gun...

751
01:15:01,730 --> 01:15:04,221
Just put the gun down
and we both go home.

752
01:15:04,399 --> 01:15:08,267
- We could go home. It's a bad day.
- Shut up! Shut up!

753
01:15:08,637 --> 01:15:10,935
Shut the hell up!

754
01:15:25,420 --> 01:15:27,945
You think God
will forgive me?

755
01:16:18,941 --> 01:16:21,637
No, you can't go to sleep.
You can't go to sleep.

756
01:16:21,810 --> 01:16:24,608
Jake, you can't go to sleep.

757
01:16:25,747 --> 01:16:28,181
They're coming. I got
through. I got through.

758
01:16:57,679 --> 01:17:00,045
Jimmy. Don't you touch him!

759
01:17:01,483 --> 01:17:02,609
Get out of the truck.

760
01:17:21,670 --> 01:17:24,104
I'm not messing around.

761
01:17:24,406 --> 01:17:26,772
Get out of the truck.

762
01:17:28,143 --> 01:17:29,735
Ty.

763
01:17:30,178 --> 01:17:33,011
- You got three seconds, Ty.
- Ty, help me.

764
01:17:33,181 --> 01:17:34,580
Come on, soldier boy.

765
01:17:34,750 --> 01:17:38,153
One, two...

766
01:18:05,914 --> 01:18:08,644
Ty? Ty? Ty?

767
01:18:25,734 --> 01:18:28,669
All right.
Are you okay? Are you okay?

768
01:18:28,837 --> 01:18:30,930
Are you okay?

769
01:18:38,246 --> 01:18:40,510
Come on, Jimmy, let's move!

770
01:18:40,682 --> 01:18:42,206
Move!

771
01:18:49,257 --> 01:18:51,487
You okay? You hurt?
Huh?

772
01:18:52,327 --> 01:18:55,524
Okay, I'm gonna make sure the cops
know how to find us. I'II be back.

773
01:18:55,697 --> 01:18:59,895
- No, no, no, Ty.
- Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy.

774
01:19:01,336 --> 01:19:02,997
I'II be back.

775
01:19:05,073 --> 01:19:06,665
All right?

776
01:22:21,569 --> 01:22:23,833
Cop told us what you did.

777
01:22:31,379 --> 01:22:33,813
There's talk of a reward.

778
01:22:43,591 --> 01:22:44,922
Hey.

779
01:22:46,594 --> 01:22:48,528
We going home?

780
01:22:53,635 --> 01:22:54,659
Yeah.
