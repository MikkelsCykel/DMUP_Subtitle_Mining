1
00:01:03,272 --> 00:01:05,399
Take off your clothes.

2
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:06,650
What?

3
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:14,408
I said, take off
your clothes.

4
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:27,254
But you saw everything
last night.

5
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:30,299
Mm, but I need
to check something.

6
00:01:30,382 --> 00:01:31,925
Shh.

7
00:01:35,387 --> 00:01:37,431
Only for three seconds.

8
00:01:56,408 --> 00:01:57,826
The bastard.

9
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:00,245
How does he
do it?

10
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,351
I've got to go.

11
00:02:22,434 --> 00:02:27,981
Don't you ever spend the night
at the woman's place?

12
00:02:31,944 --> 00:02:33,487
Never.

13
00:02:35,447 --> 00:02:39,493
What about when a woman's
at your place?

14
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:45,332
I tell her
I get insomnia...

15
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:47,334
anything.

16
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:51,004
Besides, I have
a very narrow bed.

17
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:57,511
Are you afraid
of women, Doctor?

18
00:03:00,973 --> 00:03:02,516
Of course.

19
00:03:06,478 --> 00:03:08,856
I really like you,
Tomas.

20
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:12,401
You are the complete
opposite of kitsch.

21
00:03:12,484 --> 00:03:14,862
In the kingdom
of kitsch,

22
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:16,905
you would be...

23
00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:18,532
a monster.

24
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,369
No, wait.

25
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:24,872
Sabina, I've got to go.

26
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:26,373
Ah!

27
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:28,041
Ha ha ha!

28
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:37,926
Oh...

29
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:40,053
Oh... oh...

30
00:03:41,972 --> 00:03:44,558
No, wait. Wait.

31
00:03:56,528 --> 00:03:58,405
Ha ha!

32
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:00,449
Now. What am I?

33
00:04:00,532 --> 00:04:02,409
Ha ha ha ha!

34
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:04,828
Grrr... a monster.

35
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:07,080
Ha ha ha!

36
00:05:35,586 --> 00:05:37,171
Room 6.

37
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:16,210
Here we go.

38
00:09:13,804 --> 00:09:15,889
Oh! Oh...

39
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:26,400
Ah...

40
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:41,248
Oh...

41
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:43,083
Oh!

42
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:29,314
Oh, cognac.

43
00:11:47,249 --> 00:11:50,169
Can you charge it
to my room?

44
00:11:50,252 --> 00:11:51,753
Yes, of course.

45
00:11:54,173 --> 00:11:55,799
Oh, that's funny.

46
00:11:58,135 --> 00:12:00,345
You're in Room 6.

47
00:12:00,429 --> 00:12:02,222
So?

48
00:12:02,306 --> 00:12:06,643
And my shift
finishes at 6:00.

49
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:10,355
And at 6:00,

50
00:12:10,439 --> 00:12:13,525
I have to be
back in Prague.

51
00:12:16,111 --> 00:12:17,529
Well...

52
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:21,658
around 6:00.

53
00:12:47,142 --> 00:12:49,061
Oh, I'll be back.

54
00:12:49,144 --> 00:12:52,564
Wait.

55
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:12,543
Lo lo lo

56
00:13:12,626 --> 00:13:15,587
Lo lo lo lo lo...

57
00:13:39,027 --> 00:13:41,947
You know,
this is my bench.

58
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,490
Your bench?

59
00:13:43,574 --> 00:13:46,451
Yes, I come here
every day to read,

60
00:13:46,535 --> 00:13:48,453
to this same bench.

61
00:13:48,537 --> 00:13:50,747
Isn't that funny?

62
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:54,293
Yes.

63
00:13:56,587 --> 00:13:58,463
What are you
reading?

64
00:13:58,547 --> 00:14:01,133
Anna Karenina,
by Tolstoy.

65
00:14:02,092 --> 00:14:04,011
Oh, yes,

66
00:14:04,094 --> 00:14:05,971
that Anna Karenina.

67
00:14:06,054 --> 00:14:07,639
Yeah.

68
00:14:10,225 --> 00:14:12,519
I would have come
earlier,

69
00:14:12,603 --> 00:14:15,772
but... my mother...

70
00:14:15,814 --> 00:14:18,650
You live
with your mother?

71
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:31,038
Well, I've checked out
of my room.

72
00:14:31,121 --> 00:14:32,998
Are you leaving?

73
00:14:33,081 --> 00:14:35,167
Yes, it's getting late.

74
00:14:36,585 --> 00:14:39,004
I just came
for an operation.

75
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:42,549
A colleague of mine
was supposed to come,

76
00:14:42,633 --> 00:14:44,843
but he injured
himself, so...

77
00:14:54,436 --> 00:14:55,395
Well...

78
00:14:55,479 --> 00:14:58,398
maybe I'll
come back sometime.

79
00:14:58,482 --> 00:15:01,527
Why would you
come back here?

80
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:03,820
It's so boring.

81
00:15:08,158 --> 00:15:10,035
Nobody here reads.

82
00:15:10,118 --> 00:15:12,037
Nobody here
discusses anything.

83
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,206
You know what I mean?

84
00:15:15,332 --> 00:15:17,584
Yes.

85
00:15:17,668 --> 00:15:19,711
Yes, I do.

86
00:15:22,631 --> 00:15:24,216
Well.

87
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:31,056
Nice to meet you.

88
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:33,225
Good-bye.

89
00:16:01,003 --> 00:16:02,546
Tomas.

90
00:16:06,508 --> 00:16:07,593
Tomas.

91
00:16:57,518 --> 00:17:00,604
Are you only
searching for pleasure?

92
00:17:02,523 --> 00:17:05,442
Or is every woman
a new land

93
00:17:05,526 --> 00:17:09,613
whose secrets
you want to discover?

94
00:17:16,036 --> 00:17:19,998
You want to know what
she's going to say

95
00:17:20,082 --> 00:17:22,000
when she makes love?

96
00:17:22,084 --> 00:17:24,461
Or how she will smile?

97
00:17:24,545 --> 00:17:26,964
How she will whisper?

98
00:17:27,047 --> 00:17:29,967
Groan... scream?

99
00:17:35,556 --> 00:17:41,144
Maybe the very smallest...
unimaginable details...

100
00:17:45,065 --> 00:17:48,026
Tiny things
that make one woman

101
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:50,487
totally unlike
any other.

102
00:17:50,571 --> 00:17:53,824
What's my detail,
Doctor?

103
00:18:00,581 --> 00:18:02,666
Your hat, Sabina.

104
00:18:25,647 --> 00:18:27,691
The hat...

105
00:18:31,612 --> 00:18:34,072
comes from
my grandfather's...

106
00:18:34,156 --> 00:18:36,283
grandfather.

107
00:18:39,661 --> 00:18:44,416
He lived
a long, long time ago.

108
00:18:55,677 --> 00:18:57,596
A long time ago.

109
00:19:05,687 --> 00:19:07,064
Tomas.

110
00:19:07,147 --> 00:19:10,234
What are you
looking at?

111
00:19:13,195 --> 00:19:14,738
Your eyes.

112
00:19:56,947 --> 00:19:59,491
Hello.

113
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:03,370
So...

114
00:20:03,453 --> 00:20:05,122
you are in Prague.

115
00:20:05,163 --> 00:20:07,124
I just arrived.

116
00:20:07,207 --> 00:20:09,126
I have friends to see.

117
00:20:09,168 --> 00:20:11,837
I'm here
on some business.

118
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,839
Mm-hmm.

119
00:20:15,674 --> 00:20:18,635
I'm looking
for another job.

120
00:20:18,677 --> 00:20:20,262
Ha...

121
00:20:21,054 --> 00:20:23,807
Why don't you come in?

122
00:20:23,891 --> 00:20:26,143
Are you alone?

123
00:20:26,185 --> 00:20:28,145
Yeah.

124
00:20:50,918 --> 00:20:52,961
Take off your clothes.

125
00:20:57,758 --> 00:20:58,717
Achoo!

126
00:21:00,761 --> 00:21:01,637
Achoo!

127
00:21:01,678 --> 00:21:03,138
Excuse me.

128
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:07,351
I must have caught a cold
on the train.

129
00:21:07,392 --> 00:21:11,188
Perhaps I better
take a look at you.

130
00:21:11,271 --> 00:21:12,814
Come here.

131
00:21:31,792 --> 00:21:33,710
My hands cold?

132
00:21:37,214 --> 00:21:39,174
I'm very ticklish.

133
00:21:39,258 --> 00:21:41,343
Does it hurt there?

134
00:21:45,305 --> 00:21:46,723
Look up.

135
00:21:46,765 --> 00:21:47,724
Down.

136
00:21:47,766 --> 00:21:49,726
Left.

137
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:50,727
Right.

138
00:21:50,811 --> 00:21:52,104
Ha ha...

139
00:21:57,818 --> 00:21:59,361
Don't worry.

140
00:22:00,779 --> 00:22:02,865
I'm a doctor.

141
00:22:06,285 --> 00:22:08,245
A bit higher.

142
00:22:08,328 --> 00:22:10,747
That's it.

143
00:22:13,834 --> 00:22:15,252
Breathe.

144
00:22:19,339 --> 00:22:20,883
Again.

145
00:22:26,346 --> 00:22:27,890
Cough.

146
00:22:29,349 --> 00:22:30,851
That's fine.

147
00:22:35,814 --> 00:22:37,900
Up we go.

148
00:22:49,369 --> 00:22:51,288
Everything looks fine.

149
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:53,415
Fine.

150
00:23:04,468 --> 00:23:06,428
Open your mouth.

151
00:23:08,347 --> 00:23:09,932
Tongue.

152
00:23:12,476 --> 00:23:14,311
Ah! Mmm...

153
00:23:14,394 --> 00:23:16,605
Ooh!

154
00:23:16,647 --> 00:23:19,983
Mmm! Mm!

155
00:23:29,868 --> 00:23:31,453
Ah!

156
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:07,364
Aah!

157
00:25:40,707 --> 00:25:42,125
Hi.

158
00:26:06,066 --> 00:26:07,484
Tomas?

159
00:26:07,526 --> 00:26:09,486
They called
from Geneva.

160
00:26:09,528 --> 00:26:12,489
They are still
offering you that job.

161
00:26:12,531 --> 00:26:14,992
Why should I go
to Geneva?

162
00:26:15,075 --> 00:26:16,994
Everything's
fine here.

163
00:26:17,035 --> 00:26:18,996
Well... I hope so.

164
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:21,498
You think the Russians
won't interfere?

165
00:26:21,582 --> 00:26:24,001
Think about what
happened in Hungary.

166
00:26:24,084 --> 00:26:27,004
They couldn't.
The world wouldn't allow it.

167
00:26:27,087 --> 00:26:30,007
Besides, we have socialism
with a human face.

168
00:26:30,048 --> 00:26:32,009
Who could be
against it?

169
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:34,011
Ah, my patient is here.

170
00:26:34,052 --> 00:26:36,513
Which one?
Pigs are not allowed.

171
00:26:36,555 --> 00:26:39,516
I told him to wait
in the truck.

172
00:26:39,558 --> 00:26:42,144
But we will make
an exception.

173
00:26:43,562 --> 00:26:46,523
Hello, Doctor.
You are not angry with me

174
00:26:46,565 --> 00:26:48,525
because I brought
Mephisto?

175
00:26:48,567 --> 00:26:51,028
Look, Doctor,
a gift for you.

176
00:26:51,111 --> 00:26:52,529
Wonderful.

177
00:26:52,613 --> 00:26:54,531
Oh, thank you!
Hmm.

178
00:26:54,573 --> 00:26:57,534
So... Pavel.

179
00:26:57,618 --> 00:26:59,036
Ha ha!

180
00:26:59,077 --> 00:27:01,038
We operated
a month ago.

181
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:02,039
Yeah.

182
00:27:02,122 --> 00:27:03,540
Any pains?

183
00:27:03,582 --> 00:27:04,541
No.

184
00:27:04,583 --> 00:27:06,043
Dizziness? Headaches?

185
00:27:06,084 --> 00:27:07,044
No.

186
00:27:07,085 --> 00:27:10,047
Good. You can get
back to your farm.

187
00:27:10,088 --> 00:27:12,549
We just need
a small procedure

188
00:27:12,633 --> 00:27:14,218
to replace
the bone flap.

189
00:27:25,604 --> 00:27:30,067
What time shall I expect
your visit tonight?

190
00:27:30,108 --> 00:27:32,569
Ah...

191
00:27:32,653 --> 00:27:36,573
I'm sorry,
I can't make it tonight.

192
00:27:36,657 --> 00:27:38,075
Too bad.

193
00:27:38,116 --> 00:27:42,079
Um... how about
tomorrow afternoon?

194
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:44,706
Tomorrow night.

195
00:27:47,167 --> 00:27:49,586
So what I heard
was right.

196
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:52,089
Somebody has moved
into your place.

197
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:53,590
No.

198
00:27:53,632 --> 00:27:56,718
I have my spies.
Good-bye, Doctor.

199
00:28:10,774 --> 00:28:13,735
Ah...

200
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:43,140
Ah!

201
00:28:43,182 --> 00:28:45,267
Ah...

202
00:28:52,733 --> 00:28:54,902
It's not here.

203
00:28:54,985 --> 00:28:57,196
You must have come
without your sock.

204
00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:00,866
How could I have
come without it?

205
00:29:00,949 --> 00:29:03,327
I wouldn't wear
only one sock.

206
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:06,705
You've been absent-minded lately,
always in a hurry.

207
00:29:06,788 --> 00:29:08,832
Always looking
at your watch.

208
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:16,006
I'll lend you one
of my stockings.

209
00:29:41,448 --> 00:29:44,409
You want me
to put this on?

210
00:29:44,493 --> 00:29:46,870
It's cold out,
Doctor.

211
00:29:49,289 --> 00:29:51,375
Mm-hmm.

212
00:30:14,314 --> 00:30:16,900
You think I'm doing
something silly.

213
00:30:18,819 --> 00:30:21,864
Maybe.
How can I know?

214
00:30:23,824 --> 00:30:26,410
What are we
talking about?

215
00:30:27,911 --> 00:30:30,706
Tereza.

216
00:30:35,752 --> 00:30:37,754
If I had two lives...

217
00:30:37,838 --> 00:30:41,258
with one, I'd have her
stay at my place.

218
00:30:41,341 --> 00:30:44,261
With the other,
I'd kick her out.

219
00:30:44,344 --> 00:30:47,306
Then I'd compare
and see which was best.

220
00:30:47,389 --> 00:30:49,933
But we only live once.

221
00:30:51,894 --> 00:30:54,688
Life's so light...

222
00:30:54,771 --> 00:30:58,317
like an outline
we can't ever...

223
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,776
fill in...

224
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:02,321
or correct...

225
00:31:02,404 --> 00:31:04,281
make any better.

226
00:31:04,364 --> 00:31:05,782
It's frightening.

227
00:31:05,866 --> 00:31:10,662
She's looking for something
to do here in Prague, and I...

228
00:31:12,915 --> 00:31:14,291
Now...

229
00:31:14,374 --> 00:31:18,295
you want me
to help her?

230
00:31:18,378 --> 00:31:20,797
She is not
qualified for anything,

231
00:31:20,881 --> 00:31:22,799
but she takes
beautiful pictures.

232
00:31:22,883 --> 00:31:25,802
I was wondering
if you might...

233
00:31:25,886 --> 00:31:27,304
You mean...

234
00:31:27,387 --> 00:31:30,349
you want me
to help you.

235
00:32:01,922 --> 00:32:04,508
Come on in, Tereza.

236
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:10,347
Let's have some tea.

237
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:13,016
Yes. Why don't
you fix it?

238
00:32:14,685 --> 00:32:16,270
Yeah, sure.

239
00:32:19,857 --> 00:32:21,692
Hee hee!

240
00:32:34,955 --> 00:32:37,416
It's very messy
around here.

241
00:32:37,499 --> 00:32:42,212
I always try not to get
too attached to a place,

242
00:32:42,254 --> 00:32:44,047
to objects.

243
00:32:47,467 --> 00:32:49,636
Or to people.

244
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,054
Hmm.

245
00:32:54,266 --> 00:32:56,351
Tereza, come over here.

246
00:32:59,021 --> 00:33:03,066
I want to show you
some pictures.

247
00:33:05,986 --> 00:33:07,905
You know Man Ray?

248
00:33:07,988 --> 00:33:09,573
No.

249
00:33:11,992 --> 00:33:13,577
I like...

250
00:33:15,037 --> 00:33:18,081
I like this one very much.

251
00:33:20,042 --> 00:33:21,585
Mmm.

252
00:33:26,507 --> 00:33:29,927
This is Lee Miller.

253
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:31,678
She's so...

254
00:33:33,013 --> 00:33:34,932
She's so beautiful.

255
00:33:37,559 --> 00:33:39,937
Tomas says
you're a photographer.

256
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:43,398
Well, I like to
take pictures, but...

257
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,944
Take pictures of what's
going on in the streets.

258
00:33:47,027 --> 00:33:49,363
I'll help get
them published.

259
00:33:49,446 --> 00:33:50,948
Thanks, Sabina.

260
00:33:51,031 --> 00:33:53,992
I love
those pictures.

261
00:33:54,076 --> 00:33:56,620
They were trying
something different.

262
00:33:58,038 --> 00:34:00,624
Searching for
a new beauty.

263
00:34:03,085 --> 00:34:04,628
Yes.

264
00:34:07,548 --> 00:34:09,132
Something higher.

265
00:34:12,594 --> 00:34:15,097
Here's the tea I made.

266
00:34:35,325 --> 00:34:37,661
Aaah. Aaah.

267
00:34:41,582 --> 00:34:44,168
What is it?
Tereza?

268
00:34:51,133 --> 00:34:53,177
Oh, I had a dream.

269
00:35:03,604 --> 00:35:06,190
I was at her place.

270
00:35:07,608 --> 00:35:09,067
Sabina's.

271
00:35:09,151 --> 00:35:11,278
In her studio...

272
00:35:11,361 --> 00:35:14,698
and you were
making love to her.

273
00:35:16,742 --> 00:35:19,703
In that
big bed of hers.

274
00:35:21,622 --> 00:35:24,583
You made me
stand by a wall

275
00:35:24,666 --> 00:35:27,211
and not move at all.

276
00:35:29,671 --> 00:35:32,216
You made me watch.

277
00:35:40,641 --> 00:35:43,560
And I had such pain
from seeing you

278
00:35:43,644 --> 00:35:47,606
that I started to pierce needles
under my fingernails

279
00:35:47,689 --> 00:35:50,484
to stop the pain
in my heart.

280
00:35:52,694 --> 00:35:54,821
It hurt so much.

281
00:35:57,658 --> 00:36:00,410
Why did you
do it to me?

282
00:36:04,706 --> 00:36:06,875
It was just a dream.

283
00:36:14,174 --> 00:36:17,636
Try to sleep.

284
00:36:17,719 --> 00:36:19,137
I can't sleep.

285
00:36:19,221 --> 00:36:21,640
Yes, you can. Come here.

286
00:36:21,723 --> 00:36:23,767
I can't fall asleep.

287
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:30,607
You can sleep.

288
00:36:30,691 --> 00:36:32,776
Sleep in my arms.

289
00:36:37,698 --> 00:36:39,783
Like a baby bird.

290
00:36:44,705 --> 00:36:47,124
Like a broom...

291
00:36:47,207 --> 00:36:50,669
among brooms...

292
00:36:50,752 --> 00:36:54,464
in a broom closet.

293
00:37:01,221 --> 00:37:03,807
Like a tiny parrot.

294
00:37:08,729 --> 00:37:10,814
Like a whistle.

295
00:37:13,233 --> 00:37:16,320
Like a little song.

296
00:37:19,781 --> 00:37:23,702
A song sung by a forest...

297
00:37:23,785 --> 00:37:26,830
within a forest...

298
00:37:28,749 --> 00:37:32,836
a thousand years ago.

299
00:38:39,319 --> 00:38:40,404
Oh!

300
00:39:03,385 --> 00:39:06,763
Look! They are here!
Tereza's pictures!

301
00:39:06,847 --> 00:39:08,265
Two full pages!

302
00:39:08,348 --> 00:39:09,808
Thanks, Sabina!

303
00:39:09,892 --> 00:39:11,268
Congratulations!

304
00:39:11,351 --> 00:39:12,936
They're really great!

305
00:39:14,855 --> 00:39:17,316
Tereza, this is
my colleague Jiri,

306
00:39:17,399 --> 00:39:19,318
and this is the chief.

307
00:39:19,401 --> 00:39:20,944
- I'm pleased.
- Hello.

308
00:39:22,362 --> 00:39:26,950
Wonderful! You've really
captured a new spirit here.

309
00:39:28,368 --> 00:39:30,787
You can see how
everything is changing.

310
00:39:30,871 --> 00:39:33,332
Not everything.
Look over there.

311
00:39:33,415 --> 00:39:36,210
Our comrades
with the Russians.

312
00:39:38,295 --> 00:39:41,006
Some people
never change.

313
00:39:42,007 --> 00:39:44,760
Some people are
always scoundrels.

314
00:39:44,801 --> 00:39:46,803
How can you tell?

315
00:39:46,845 --> 00:39:49,264
Does it show
in a man's face?

316
00:39:49,306 --> 00:39:52,267
Can we judge
by a man's face

317
00:39:52,309 --> 00:39:55,312
if he is
a scoundrel or not?

318
00:39:55,354 --> 00:39:57,940
Let's look
at them and see.

319
00:40:01,485 --> 00:40:10,410
Scoundrel.

320
00:40:10,494 --> 00:40:12,538
- Scoundrel.
- Scoundrel.

321
00:40:12,621 --> 00:40:14,331
- Definitely.
- No doubt.

322
00:40:16,166 --> 00:40:17,584
We know you.

323
00:40:17,668 --> 00:40:19,545
Scoundrels.

324
00:40:24,842 --> 00:40:27,386
What would you say
about Tomas?

325
00:40:27,469 --> 00:40:29,012
Hmmm.

326
00:40:29,096 --> 00:40:30,556
He's definitely
scoundrel.

327
00:40:30,639 --> 00:40:32,057
Why?

328
00:40:33,517 --> 00:40:35,435
Why?

329
00:40:35,519 --> 00:40:37,688
Is it the mouth?

330
00:40:38,981 --> 00:40:40,440
The sly eyes?

331
00:40:40,524 --> 00:40:43,151
No, it's carefully hidden...

332
00:40:43,193 --> 00:40:44,653
in the brain.

333
00:40:44,695 --> 00:40:48,407
Such things are hidden
in all of our brains.

334
00:40:48,490 --> 00:40:50,409
So what makes
the difference?

335
00:40:50,492 --> 00:40:52,452
Maybe only
one millionth part.

336
00:40:52,536 --> 00:40:54,413
Maybe there is
no difference.

337
00:40:54,496 --> 00:40:58,792
These men don't even know
if they're scoundrels or not.

338
00:41:11,555 --> 00:41:13,473
Are you serious?

339
00:41:13,557 --> 00:41:16,435
More than 100,000 people
were imprisoned, tortured,

340
00:41:16,518 --> 00:41:18,937
executed in their regime.

341
00:41:19,021 --> 00:41:21,815
And now,
these men cry out

342
00:41:21,899 --> 00:41:24,610
that they didn't
know anything...

343
00:41:26,069 --> 00:41:30,407
that they were
misled or manipulated.

344
00:41:30,449 --> 00:41:32,868
That they were... innocent.

345
00:41:32,910 --> 00:41:34,411
Not innocent,

346
00:41:34,453 --> 00:41:36,455
but, um...

347
00:41:36,538 --> 00:41:38,415
unaware, perhaps.

348
00:41:38,457 --> 00:41:41,543
They had to know
what they were doing.

349
00:41:41,627 --> 00:41:43,712
Otherwise,
it's unthinkable.

350
00:41:43,795 --> 00:41:46,882
It doesn't matter
whether they knew or not.

351
00:41:55,849 --> 00:41:58,852
- Boo! -
Boo! - Boo!

352
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:19,540
I've been thinking
about Oedipus.

353
00:42:19,623 --> 00:42:21,500
Good King Oedipus.

354
00:42:21,583 --> 00:42:26,672
Is sleeping with your mother
the same sort of crime?

355
00:42:28,131 --> 00:42:32,052
When Oedipus realized that
he had killed his father-

356
00:42:32,135 --> 00:42:34,263
unknowingly...

357
00:42:34,346 --> 00:42:36,306
unknowingly killed his father...

358
00:42:36,348 --> 00:42:39,142
and was sleeping
with his mother...

359
00:42:39,226 --> 00:42:41,562
and that because of his crimes

360
00:42:41,645 --> 00:42:43,564
plagues were
ravaging his city,

361
00:42:43,647 --> 00:42:47,568
he couldn't bear
the sight of what he'd done.

362
00:42:47,651 --> 00:42:51,530
He plucked out
his own eyes and left.

363
00:42:51,613 --> 00:42:54,032
He did not feel innocent.

364
00:42:54,116 --> 00:42:57,578
He felt he had to
punish himself.

365
00:42:57,661 --> 00:42:59,580
But...

366
00:42:59,663 --> 00:43:01,999
our leaders, unlike Oedipus,

367
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:05,502
they felt
they were innocent.

368
00:43:05,586 --> 00:43:10,966
And when the atrocities
of the Stalinist period became known,

369
00:43:11,008 --> 00:43:13,051
they cried,
"We didn't know!

370
00:43:13,135 --> 00:43:16,054
We weren't aware
of what was going on.

371
00:43:16,138 --> 00:43:18,056
Our conscience is clear. "

372
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:20,642
But the important
difference is...

373
00:43:25,147 --> 00:43:27,566
they stayed in power.

374
00:43:27,649 --> 00:43:30,736
And they should have
plucked their eyes out.

375
00:43:34,531 --> 00:43:36,450
All I'm saying is that

376
00:43:36,533 --> 00:43:38,410
morality has changed
since Oedipus.

377
00:44:19,243 --> 00:44:20,661
Come on.

378
00:44:20,744 --> 00:44:21,787
Yes!

379
00:44:23,705 --> 00:44:26,124
Why don't you
write it down?

380
00:44:26,208 --> 00:44:28,126
I'm not a writer.

381
00:44:28,210 --> 00:44:31,630
It will be published.
Our politics are in it.

382
00:44:31,713 --> 00:44:34,842
I don't really care
about politics.

383
00:44:39,721 --> 00:44:42,599
What do you
care about?

384
00:45:07,291 --> 00:45:09,209
Is something
bothering you?

385
00:45:09,293 --> 00:45:10,836
No, why?

386
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:19,720
What's wrong?

387
00:45:19,803 --> 00:45:20,762
Nothing.

388
00:45:20,846 --> 00:45:22,181
No...

389
00:45:22,264 --> 00:45:26,852
When I watched you
dancing with another man...

390
00:45:28,312 --> 00:45:33,650
I thought to myself,
"He could be her lover. "

391
00:45:33,734 --> 00:45:35,861
You are jealous.

392
00:45:37,154 --> 00:45:39,031
No, I'm not jealous.

393
00:45:39,114 --> 00:45:40,741
You are.

394
00:45:40,824 --> 00:45:42,409
I'm not.

395
00:45:42,492 --> 00:45:44,369
I'm not jealous, Tereza.

396
00:45:44,453 --> 00:45:46,288
He's jealous.

397
00:45:46,330 --> 00:45:48,415
No, he isn't.
Who's he?

398
00:45:48,498 --> 00:45:49,917
He's jealous

399
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,376
I'm not jealous.

400
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:53,378
He's jealous,
he's jealous

401
00:45:53,462 --> 00:45:55,380
Whatever you say, Tereza.

402
00:45:55,464 --> 00:45:56,924
You're jealous.

403
00:45:57,007 --> 00:45:58,383
I'm not.

404
00:45:58,467 --> 00:45:59,885
Yes, you are.

405
00:45:59,968 --> 00:46:01,428
You're jealous.

406
00:46:01,512 --> 00:46:02,888
I'm not jealous.

407
00:46:02,971 --> 00:46:04,389
You're jealous.

408
00:46:04,473 --> 00:46:05,974
Doo be doo
be doo be doo

409
00:46:06,058 --> 00:46:07,434
No!

410
00:46:07,518 --> 00:46:08,936
You are!

411
00:46:09,019 --> 00:46:10,437
I'm not.

412
00:46:10,521 --> 00:46:11,897
You are!

413
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:13,398
Let go!

414
00:46:13,482 --> 00:46:15,943
I won't let go!
You're jealous!

415
00:46:16,026 --> 00:46:17,444
You are!

416
00:46:17,528 --> 00:46:19,404
I'm not!

417
00:46:19,488 --> 00:46:21,406
No! No! No!

418
00:46:21,490 --> 00:46:25,285
No! No! No!
Ha ha ha ha!

419
00:46:25,369 --> 00:46:27,412
Will you marry me?

420
00:46:27,496 --> 00:46:28,956
What? No!

421
00:46:29,039 --> 00:46:29,915
Yes!

422
00:46:29,998 --> 00:46:30,958
No!

423
00:46:31,041 --> 00:46:31,917
Yes!

424
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,669
- Yes.
- No.

425
00:46:33,710 --> 00:46:35,587
- No.
- Yes.

426
00:46:35,671 --> 00:46:37,297
Yes? Ha!

427
00:46:37,381 --> 00:46:38,882
Be my witness?

428
00:46:38,966 --> 00:46:40,425
Of course!

429
00:46:40,509 --> 00:46:43,428
I'll have to buy
Mephisto a black tie.

430
00:46:43,512 --> 00:46:46,765
Did you hear, Mephisto?
A black tie.

431
00:46:49,059 --> 00:46:50,477
My dear fiances,

432
00:46:50,561 --> 00:46:52,688
I am welcoming you

433
00:46:52,771 --> 00:46:56,483
from the deep bottom
of my heart

434
00:46:56,567 --> 00:46:58,944
on this very special day

435
00:46:59,027 --> 00:47:05,492
when you freely decided
to be legally man and wife.

436
00:47:05,576 --> 00:47:10,455
I suppose that
both of you know your duties

437
00:47:10,539 --> 00:47:13,208
in supporting each other,

438
00:47:13,250 --> 00:47:16,211
and I am sure
both of you know

439
00:47:16,253 --> 00:47:18,380
your own medical records?

440
00:47:20,048 --> 00:47:22,467
I have to
tell you this.

441
00:47:22,551 --> 00:47:27,389
Don't think a life is
a walk on a sunny meadow.

442
00:47:27,431 --> 00:47:30,475
Life isn't a walk
on a sunny meadow,

443
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:35,314
and life isn't a walk
on a rose garden.

444
00:47:35,397 --> 00:47:41,486
Our socialist country
has done much for you.

445
00:47:41,570 --> 00:47:45,157
Now it's up to you.

446
00:47:47,117 --> 00:47:48,368
Shh.

447
00:47:48,452 --> 00:47:50,454
Shh!

448
00:47:52,998 --> 00:47:55,709
I make you laugh?

449
00:47:55,792 --> 00:47:57,419
No... no.

450
00:47:59,046 --> 00:48:00,005
Shh!

451
00:48:00,088 --> 00:48:03,050
You are laughing at me?

452
00:48:04,593 --> 00:48:06,678
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

453
00:48:09,848 --> 00:48:11,934
I refuse to go on.

454
00:48:12,017 --> 00:48:15,562
In this country,
is nothing sacred anymore?

455
00:48:15,646 --> 00:48:18,190
If you can't be serious,

456
00:48:18,273 --> 00:48:20,901
you don't deserve
to be married!

457
00:49:04,695 --> 00:49:06,113
Mmm!

458
00:49:06,196 --> 00:49:08,615
Let's take one, Tomas.

459
00:49:08,699 --> 00:49:11,827
It will make us happy.

460
00:49:11,910 --> 00:49:13,954
Choose one.

461
00:49:16,665 --> 00:49:18,250
This one.

462
00:49:19,459 --> 00:49:21,587
Hey!

463
00:49:21,670 --> 00:49:24,464
My nephew from
the country's here!

464
00:49:27,968 --> 00:49:29,136
Uncle!

465
00:49:29,219 --> 00:49:30,762
Hey!

466
00:49:38,562 --> 00:49:40,606
Let's call him Tolstoy.

467
00:49:40,689 --> 00:49:42,649
When I first met you,

468
00:49:42,733 --> 00:49:44,776
you were
reading Tolstoy.

469
00:49:48,739 --> 00:49:50,657
It can't be Tolstoy.

470
00:49:50,741 --> 00:49:52,159
It's a girl.

471
00:49:52,242 --> 00:49:53,660
It's a girl!

472
00:49:53,744 --> 00:49:56,788
How about Anna Karenina?

473
00:49:59,208 --> 00:50:02,127
It doesn't look at all
like Anna Karenina.

474
00:50:02,211 --> 00:50:04,129
Look.
It's a man's face.

475
00:50:04,213 --> 00:50:06,798
It looks more
like Anna's husband.

476
00:50:10,219 --> 00:50:12,221
Let's call her Karenin.

477
00:50:35,285 --> 00:50:36,662
Karenin.

478
00:50:36,745 --> 00:50:39,331
Come on, Karenin.
Let's go home.

479
00:50:47,297 --> 00:50:49,258
Heh heh heh...

480
00:50:55,806 --> 00:50:57,683
I like it very much.

481
00:50:57,766 --> 00:50:59,893
King Oedipus.

482
00:50:59,977 --> 00:51:02,688
It's a very good idea.

483
00:51:02,771 --> 00:51:07,693
And with those changes,
we can publish next week.

484
00:51:07,776 --> 00:51:11,363
Eva, will you
type this, please?

485
00:51:20,497 --> 00:51:23,709
Now we can publish
a piece like this.

486
00:51:23,792 --> 00:51:25,377
It's fantastic.

487
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:26,837
Think about it.

488
00:51:26,879 --> 00:51:29,923
Complete rehabilitation of
the people who were prosecuted.

489
00:51:30,007 --> 00:51:32,801
Complete freedom of speech,
of the press,

490
00:51:32,843 --> 00:51:35,429
emancipation
from the Russians.

491
00:51:35,512 --> 00:51:37,139
That's all we wanted.

492
00:51:37,222 --> 00:51:41,435
And you think the Russians
will let us emancipate?

493
00:51:41,518 --> 00:51:43,478
What can they do?

494
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:45,480
Nothing, Doctor.

495
00:51:45,522 --> 00:51:49,109
Nothing, nothing, nothing!

496
00:51:51,528 --> 00:51:52,946
Keep on writing.

497
00:51:53,030 --> 00:51:55,657
Thanks, but surgery's easier.

498
00:54:41,615 --> 00:54:43,659
Take me to them.

499
00:54:45,202 --> 00:54:46,787
Oh, you're awake.

500
00:54:52,209 --> 00:54:54,169
Take me to them.

501
00:54:54,211 --> 00:54:55,838
To whom?

502
00:54:57,047 --> 00:54:59,174
To the other women.

503
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:07,683
Take me to them
when you make love to them.

504
00:55:07,724 --> 00:55:10,185
I'll undress them for you.

505
00:55:10,227 --> 00:55:12,312
I'd like to.

506
00:55:16,233 --> 00:55:17,818
Really.

507
00:55:19,236 --> 00:55:22,948
I'll give them a bath
and bring them to you.

508
00:55:23,031 --> 00:55:25,659
I'll do anything you like.

509
00:55:25,742 --> 00:55:29,830
Other women's bodies
will be our playthings.

510
00:55:34,751 --> 00:55:37,588
Tereza, what are
you talking about?

511
00:55:39,756 --> 00:55:42,217
I know you see
other women.

512
00:55:42,259 --> 00:55:43,719
I know it!

513
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:46,638
You can't hide it from me.

514
00:55:54,771 --> 00:55:57,691
Every day,
I try to tell myself,

515
00:55:57,774 --> 00:55:59,860
"Well, it's nothing.

516
00:56:02,779 --> 00:56:04,239
It's not important.

517
00:56:04,281 --> 00:56:06,742
He's just playing around.

518
00:56:06,783 --> 00:56:08,702
He can't resist it.

519
00:56:08,785 --> 00:56:10,704
But he loves me.

520
00:56:10,787 --> 00:56:12,706
I'm sure about that.

521
00:56:12,789 --> 00:56:14,374
He loves me. "

522
00:56:15,792 --> 00:56:17,878
"He loves me!"

523
00:56:20,297 --> 00:56:22,716
But I can't stand it.

524
00:56:22,799 --> 00:56:24,218
I tried hard.

525
00:56:24,301 --> 00:56:25,719
I just can't.

526
00:56:25,802 --> 00:56:28,805
Take me to them.
Don't leave me alone!

527
00:56:28,889 --> 00:56:30,432
Tereza, calm down.

528
00:56:30,516 --> 00:56:32,476
Stop talking.
Try to sleep.

529
00:56:32,518 --> 00:56:34,478
You need
some sleep now.

530
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:37,105
I don't
want to sleep.

531
00:56:41,652 --> 00:56:43,612
You're tired of me.

532
00:56:43,695 --> 00:56:46,532
I know that.

533
00:56:50,994 --> 00:56:54,331
I can see it
in your eyes.

534
00:56:59,586 --> 00:57:02,506
Arf! Arf! Arf!
Arf! Arf! Arf!

535
00:57:08,470 --> 00:57:09,888
Hello.

536
00:57:09,972 --> 00:57:11,515
Yes.

537
00:57:12,933 --> 00:57:13,851
What?

538
00:57:13,934 --> 00:57:15,310
Tereza!

539
00:57:29,283 --> 00:57:30,909
Here they come!
