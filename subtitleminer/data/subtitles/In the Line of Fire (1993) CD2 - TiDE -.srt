00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:08,471
I couldn't help wondering why you'd
risk your life to save such a man.

2
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:13,595
You have such a strange job. I can't
decide if it's heroic or absurd.

3
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:18,715
Why would you risk your life
to kill a man like that?

4
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:23,516
<i>- Read my psychological profile. </i>
- I don't believe in them.

5
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:28,396
Nor do I. A man's actions don't equal
the sum of his psychological parts.

6
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:31,239
- It doesn't work that way.
- Just how does it work?

7
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:41,796
It doesn't work. God doesn't punish
the wicked and reward the righteous.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,118
<i>Everyone dies. </i>
<i>Some die because they deserve to. </i>

9
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,952
<i>Others die because they come</i>
<i>from Minneapolis. It's meaningless. </i>

10
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,517
If none of this means anything,
why kill the President?

11
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:03,396
- To punctuate the dreariness.
- You need to get yourself laid.

12
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,271
You're the same. Name one thing
in your life that has any meaning.

13
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,596
- I play the piano.
<i>- That's not enough. </i>

14
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,313
How do you know? Do you play?

15
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,913
I've seen you in your bar alone.

16
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:26,389
There's no cause worth fighting for.
All we have is the game.

17
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:31,116
- I'm on offence. You're on defense.
- When do we start playing the game?

18
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:35,470
The clock's ticking, Frank.
Take care.

19
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,549
He scrambled it. I missed him.

20
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:48,433
Fuck!

21
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:19,034
Jesus, Frank.

22
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:24,956
I called for hours.
I thought something happened to you.

23
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:32,271
I'm sick, I'm tired
and I'm armed, too. So be careful.

24
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:37,713
- You're also maybe a genius.
- Not to be recognized in this lifetime.

25
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,117
- Did you listen to the call?
- Yeah, remember...?

26
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,276
Call the field office in Minneapolis.

27
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,511
See what you can find
about the accidental deaths.

28
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:49,110
Frank!
Will you listen to me, please?

29
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,638
- Spit it out, damn it!
- We spoke to some model builders.

30
00:02:53,840 --> 00:03:00,871
There is a professor at Pasadena
College. I think we've got something.

31
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:05,835
I met him at a design conference
in New Orleans a year ago.

32
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:11,433
We ordered a few rounds of drinks.
He seemed like a nice enough guy.

33
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:15,394
But when we talked politics
he got a nasty edge.

34
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:21,835
He said the government betrayed him
and he was out for revenge.

35
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,873
The way he said it scared me.

36
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:29,790
I said, "Nice talking to you. "
And I got the hell out of there.

37
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,712
For the life of me
I cannot remember his name.

38
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:38,993
But I'm pretty sure
he said he was from Phoenix.

39
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:44,957
You ought to talk to a guy
in Phoenix named Walter Wickland.

40
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:50,154
- We're going to Phoenix.
- Let's get a police artist.

41
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:55,753
- Have a sketch faxed to us.
- You figured that out by yourself?

42
00:03:55,960 --> 00:04:00,636
- Kiss my ass, Frank.
- I told you you'd make a good agent.

43
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:07,834
That doesn't look much like him,
but it's got to be Mitch Leary.

44
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:13,757
- I haven't seen him in over a year.
- What do you know about the guy?

45
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:17,999
You see this wheelchair?
Mitch bought it for me.

46
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:21,795
It cost over $1,000.

47
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,834
- You see this?
- Take it easy now.

48
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:29,237
This is in case he ever comes back.

49
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,637
He accused me
of ripping off his design.

50
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:36,150
He said my penalty for disloyalty
was death.

51
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:39,910
If you put him away,
I'll sleep better.

52
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:45,234
- Where can we find him?
- I've got his address somewhere.

53
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,994
Don't move.

54
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,236
Drop it!

55
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,158
- Let him go, Horrigan.
- I got him.

56
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:26,911
It's okay. We're on the same team.

57
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:32,797
- Hands, motherfucker!
- I'm getting my identification!

58
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:37,030
- Give it to me.
- David Coppinger. CIA.

59
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,631
- And who's this asshole?
- He's with me.

60
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,709
- God dammit!
- Are you here for Leary or me?

61
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:52,311
Mr. Leary used to be
one of our operatives.

62
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:58,588
- He's threatened to kill the President.
- We didn't think he was serious.

63
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,519
- But you knew. You and the FBI.
- I understand your frustration.

64
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:05,759
You understand my frustration?
You pompous son of a bitch!

65
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,915
What did Leary do for you?
Run drugs? Sell arms to Iran?

66
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:15,398
It's a C-12 matter,
so this is off the record.

67
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,477
If asked, I'm going to deny it.

68
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:26,117
- Leary's what we call a wet boy.
- What's a wet boy, Frank?

69
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:34,159
- Leary's an assassin.
- He's more like a predator.

70
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:54,518
- Was that you shooting?
- Yes.

71
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,555
- What kind of gun is that?
- Something I made.

72
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:04,837
You made it?
That beats paying for it.

73
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,873
- Can I see it?
- Yeah.

74
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:13,311
- It's light. What's it made of?
- It's composite. Like plastic.

75
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:18,271
Pretty neat!
Mind if I give her a little dance?

76
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:22,075
- Not at all.
- Go for it.

77
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:33,112
That is great! That is really great!

78
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:42,593
- Would you sell it?
- No, I need it.

79
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:48,193
- For what?
- To assassinate the President.

80
00:08:55,400 --> 00:09:00,110
- Why would you want to do that for?
- Why did you kill that bird?

81
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:12,320
Leary was one of our most effective
contractors, but times changed.

82
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:16,911
Cutbacks had to be made.
Leary didn't take it too well.

83
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:22,752
- We've not been able to locate him.
- We can work together on this.

84
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:27,909
- Wouldn't that be refreshing?
- We have fingerprints and photos.

85
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:34,230
- These are at least 15 years old.
- He's camera-shy.

86
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:40,351
He'll be in disguise, anyway.
We need photo alterations, Sam.

87
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:45,793
What I'm about to show you
is highly classified.

88
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:51,473
This is a former colleague
of Leary's. A close friend.

89
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:56,834
He went by Leary's home to try
and get him to accept counseling.

90
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:01,113
This is how Leary
treats his friends.

91
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:12,118
We need every possible variable.
Facial hair, glasses, weight change.

92
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,835
Keep in mind
he's 15 years older now.

93
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,437
As good as they are, they aren't
much good. The eyes are dead.

94
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:45,519
You can always tell a man
by his eyes.

95
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:49,989
- Tomorrow morning I'd like you to...
- I'm resigning tomorrow.

96
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,873
What?

97
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:58,393
What for? Because you were scared
down in Phoenix? I was scared too.

98
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:05,872
I have nightmares about that
boat with the bag over my head.

99
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:09,959
I can't breathe.
Phoenix clinched it.

100
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:15,837
- The service has counselors.
- I've been to counselors.

101
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:20,717
- We can get this guy.
- I can't do it!

102
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:27,439
Stop this cockamamie shit.
Come on, pal, I need you.

103
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:30,279
Please.

104
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:38,397
Okay, Frank.

105
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:49,511
Cockamamie. That's a word
your generation hasn't embraced yet.

106
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:53,998
You ought to use it once in a while
to keep it alive.

107
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:57,237
- Cockamamie!
- Yeah.

108
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,512
- Oh, God!
- Well, it made you laugh.

109
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,671
You kill me, Frank.

110
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:16,756
Hello, Frank. And let me welcome
all of you joining our programme.

111
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:19,838
I know who you are, Leary.

112
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:29,550
I'm glad. Friends should be able
to call each other by name.

113
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,116
- We're not friends.
<i>- Sure, we are. </i>

114
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,237
I've seen what you do to friends.

115
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:42,110
- What's that supposed to mean?
- You slit your friend's throat.

116
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:55,356
- You talked to Coppinger?
<i>- Yeah. </i>

117
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:59,348
Did you de-louse?
The man's a professional liar.

118
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:04,118
- I saw the photos.
<i>- No, you saw what he wanted you to see. </i>

119
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:07,750
I saw a picture of your friend
with his throat cut.

120
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:12,636
What you don't know
is that they sent my best friend...

121
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:17,311
...to my home to kill me!

122
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:21,875
<i>- Your voice is shaking. </i>
- I haven't lied to you, Frank!

123
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:26,437
Everyone who ever knew you
says you're sick.

124
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:31,634
- Your colleagues. Your wife.
<i>- What does your wife say about you?</i>

125
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:35,628
Frank, I want you to understand.

126
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:41,198
We both used to think that this
country was a very special place.

127
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:46,793
Do you have any idea
what I've done for God and country?

128
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,514
Some horrible things!

129
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:54,350
I don't even remember who I was
before they got their claws into me.

130
00:13:54,720 --> 00:14:01,876
- They made you into a real monster.
- And now they want to destroy me.

131
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,634
What do you see when you're in
the dark and the demons come?

132
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:19,638
I see you standing over the grave
of another dead President.

133
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,958
- That's not gonna happen.
- Fuck you, Frank.

134
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:28,393
I'm willing to trade my life
for his and that's all it takes.

135
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:32,593
That President is coming home
from California in a box.

136
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:37,359
- Where in California?
- The address?

137
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:41,633
I'll keep you in the game,
but I won't throw it for you.

138
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:46,914
- I want you to give yourself up.
<i>- To live a long and fruitful life?</i>

139
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:53,397
Don't lie to me.
I have a rendezvous with death.

140
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,639
So does the President.
And so do you, if you get too close.

141
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:04,791
- You have a rendezvous with my ass!
- You know how easily I could kill you?

142
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,436
I've watched you go home.

143
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:12,872
<i>You are alive because</i>
<i>I have allowed you to live. </i>

144
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:16,152
Show me some damn respect!

145
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,315
St. Francis Hotel!

146
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,279
Frank.

147
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:37,311
Take my hand, Frank.

148
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:41,509
Take it. If you don't, you'll die.

149
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,993
Take it.

150
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:06,358
You're gonna shoot me
after I saved your life?

151
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:15,633
The only way to save the President
is to shoot me.

152
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,435
Are you willing
to trade your life for his...

153
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:22,871
...or is life too precious?

154
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:41,032
Leary, don't move!

155
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,954
I got him!

156
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,912
Al?

157
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:29,518
There's nothing here.

158
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:21,148
Frank, you've got a phone call.

159
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:36,431
Frank, you looked so sad on the bus.
I'm sorry, it was self-defense.

160
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:48,198
- Tell me about Skellum.
<i>- Skellum is worthless. </i>

161
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:53,713
- Are you gonna meet him in L.A.?
- You're way behind in the game.

162
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,993
I'm way ahead. I know what you
look like. I've seen your eyes.

163
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:01,317
<i>- They might look different next time. </i>
- Not what's behind them.

164
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:06,355
- You better pray I never find you.
- You want to kill me, Frank?

165
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:09,358
That's right.

166
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:13,394
<i>- The irony's so thick here. </i>
<i>- There is no irony!</i>

167
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:19,277
The same government that trained
me to kill, trained you to protect.

168
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:23,109
Now you want to kill me.
Up on that roof I protected you.

169
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,078
They'll write books about us.

170
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:31,071
- I'm tired of your bullshit!
- Don't be a poor sport.

171
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:38,118
You could have taken me out,
but you chose to save your ass.

172
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,398
It does make me wonder about Dallas.

173
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:50,439
<i>Did you really do all you could,</i>
<i>or did you make a choice there too?</i>

174
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,599
Do you really have the guts
to take a bullet?

175
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:58,793
I'll be thinking about that
when I'm pissing on your grave.

176
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:06,994
There's no one named Skellum
in all of Los Angeles?

177
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:11,239
- What about Louisiana?
<i>- Hang on. </i>

178
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:17,675
<i>No Skellums. Sorry. </i>

179
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:20,519
Damn it!

180
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:32,831
- The election's in three weeks.
- Just stay out of California.

181
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:36,794
If this guy's so smart, he's not gonna
tell you where he'll do it.

182
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,309
I don't think he'd lie to me.

183
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,796
You've become that close?

184
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,198
California is the key
to the whole race.

185
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:53,032
- We can't let up now.
- We have to change our procedure.

186
00:23:53,240 --> 00:24:00,635
- Frisk people within 50 yards.
- At $10,000 dinners?

187
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:04,833
- You're overreacting.
- Lf I don't, the President's dead.

188
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:09,192
- Why is he even here?
- He's heading this investigation.

189
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:13,678
Then let him investigate,
but keep him out of sight.

190
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,075
If you'll excuse me,
I'm in the middle of a campaign.

191
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:29,275
Frank. Hi.

192
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:35,992
- Up late?
- L.A. Will be a lot of work.

193
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:40,478
- What's up?
- I've got a request.

194
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:46,311
I'd like you to talk to Watts.
Get me on your team.

195
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:55,470
- He thinks you'll overreact.
- What do you think?

196
00:24:55,680 --> 00:25:00,834
- You're too close to all this.
- That's why I've got to be there.

197
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:05,830
- I can spot him. Anticipate him.
- You think he'll be in California?

198
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:11,831
- Why would he tip you off?
- He wants to keep the game close.

199
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:20,079
This has nothing to do with
you and me. Strictly professional.

200
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:24,554
But that son of a bitch
killed my partner. My friend.

201
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:28,630
I know. I'm sorry.

202
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:35,878
You're looking at a living legend.

203
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:40,312
The only active agent
who ever lost a President.

204
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:45,319
Please.

205
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:01,068
Mr. Horrigan, welcome to Los Angeles.

206
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:07,790
<i>Can the President close the gap</i>
<i>in the little time he has left?</i>

207
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:13,711
<i>Today he's in California for a rally</i>
<i>at the Bonaventure Hotel. </i>

208
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:27,794
<i>Field office, the advance team</i>
<i>is at the Bonaventure. </i>

209
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,753
- Any problems?
- No.

210
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:25,110
<i>We've swept the motorcade route. </i>

211
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:30,952
<i>Manholes are secured. Mailboxes</i>
<i>removed. Abandoned vehicles towed. </i>

212
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,952
We'll need sharpshooters
on both those towers.

213
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:46,154
We need sharpshooters
to cover those restricted areas.

214
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:50,239
<i>Other polls today had the President</i>
<i>three points behind. </i>

215
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:54,752
<i>He'll have to close that margin</i>
<i>in California. </i>

216
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:06,838
<i>Welcome to Los Angeles</i>
<i>International Airport. </i>

217
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:05,993
- Raines, double-checking those exits?
<i>- Yes, this is the third time now. </i>

218
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:18,072
Alert, section five.

219
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,998
Secret Service.

220
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:41,191
- Robert Stermer.
- He's a bellboy. He's cleared.

221
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:48,877
- Robert, have a nice day.
- No questions.

222
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:53,358
Come on, pack it up and move.

223
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:57,589
Mr. Carney, all set.

224
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:01,110
Finally we meet!
You are James Carney?

225
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:07,589
- You must be Sandy Riggs.
- So you really do exist.

226
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:13,557
- I'm very much human.
- Let's go up to the bar.

227
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:19,830
- When does the President arrive?
- Tomorrow, before dinner.

228
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:25,717
Here's an invitation. Don't lose it.
The Secret Service is acting crazy.

229
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:30,391
You've got a great seat,
just across from the President.

230
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:35,633
So what is Microspan Corporation
all about?

231
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:40,356
I just came to meet the President.
I won't bore you with business.

232
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:44,314
I don't blame you.
I don't understand high-tech.

233
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:48,638
I can't wait to introduce you.
Look at this beautiful view.

234
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:51,758
Yes, very pretty.

235
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:58,318
Give me the list of dinner guests.
Who was the organizer?

236
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:03,150
Sanford Riggs
of the California Victory Fund.

237
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:08,479
Call LAPD and make sure
they have no uniforms missing.

238
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:15,029
- It's been taken care of.
- Call the hospital about blood.

239
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:20,799
Your average American businessman
who looks at product marketing...

240
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:25,994
...sees the length and width of it.
The Japanese see the depth.

241
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:31,593
We plan the next fiscal quarter.
They plan the next quarter century.

242
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:38,751
- Our people don't understand that.
- Mr. Riggs, can I talk to you?

243
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:43,394
- Who's that?
- Secret Service agent.

244
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:47,430
- Do you know all these people?
- I sure do.

245
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:52,839
- How about these pictures here?
- I went through all this yesterday.

246
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:56,589
I'll cooperate, but this is
bordering on harassment.

247
00:32:56,800 --> 00:33:00,076
I'm a harassing kind of guy.

248
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,631
No, no, no, no.

249
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,230
I'll be right back, Mr. Carney.

250
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,312
He did what anyone of us would.

251
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:12,069
<i>He beat up a bellboy on television. </i>
<i>I'd say he was overwrought. </i>

252
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:15,232
We're all overwrought.
Leary's out there someplace.

253
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:18,432
<i>- You don't think he's a liability?</i>
- No.

254
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:21,399
<i>Well, you're in the minority. </i>
<i>I want him gone. </i>

255
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:25,878
<i>- Send him on to San Diego. </i>
- By whose order?

256
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:30,073
<i>Traveler. </i>
<i>Do you want to tell him or should I?</i>

257
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:34,558
Miss Raines, somebody's
approaching Traveler’s suite.

258
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:12,239
- Hi.
- Hi.

259
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:20,756
- What are you doing up here?
- Seeing what I could do.

260
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:27,952
Between the LAPD,
the FBI and the rest of us...

261
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:33,359
...there are 229 people
protecting Traveler tomorrow.

262
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:37,191
A lot of guns.

263
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:43,193
If Leary gets off a shot,
we could be killed in the crossfire.

264
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:47,638
Frank.

265
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:53,876
- Bill Watts just called.
- Heard about the bellman?

266
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:57,117
So did Traveler.

267
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:02,792
They want you to go to San Diego
and assist in the advance.

268
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,231
Just like that.

269
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:11,071
It's not just you against Leary.

270
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:15,558
Have some faith in the rest of us.

271
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:20,317
You know something?

272
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:26,359
For years I've been listening
to all these idiots...

273
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:31,270
...with their pet theories on Dallas.

274
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:35,075
It was the Cubans, or the CIA.

275
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:38,317
The white supremacists, or the mob.

276
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:43,674
Whether it was one weapon
or whether it was five.

277
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:48,350
None of that meant too much to me.

278
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,879
But Leary...

279
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:57,835
He questioned whether I had the guts
to take that fatal bullet.

280
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:03,829
God, that was a beautiful day.

281
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:09,430
The sun was out.

282
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:13,317
It had been raining all morning.

283
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:21,596
The first shot
sounded like a firecracker.

284
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:25,793
I looked over and saw him.
I could tell he was hit.

285
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:32,031
I don't know why I didn't react.

286
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:36,711
I should've reacted.
I should've been running.

287
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:41,436
I just couldn't believe it.

288
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:49,430
If only I'd reacted,
I could've taken that shot.

289
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:58,189
It would've been all right with me.

290
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:48,753
- What's the number in San Diego?
- 619 ukulele.

291
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:52,709
- Ukulele?
- That's how I remember it.

292
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:57,038
You just push U-K-E-L-E-L-E.

293
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:03,594
- Ukulele? Isn't that U-K-U?
- I don't know.

294
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:08,828
But the phone number is U-K-E-L-E-L-E.

295
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:22,836
U- K-E-L. Wait a second.

296
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:42,469
Jesus.

297
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:47,111
We have an arrival.
Chopper standing by.

298
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:04,469
<i>- Southwest Savings, may I help you?</i>
- Southwest?

299
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:10,073
<i>- Yes. May I help you? Hello?</i>
- What's your address?

300
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:17,436
Taxi!

301
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:25,470
- Post check. Post 3?
<i>- In place. </i>

302
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:28,114
- Post 6?
<i>- In place. </i>

303
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,959
<i>- Post 12?</i>
- In place.

304
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:39,678
Wait right here.

305
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:44,870
There's no Leary in our accounts.

306
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:50,108
Try to imagine him in disguise.
A hat, wigs, that sort of thing.

307
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:56,278
- I haven't been here long.
- Who was here before you?

308
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:00,996
- Pam Magnus.
- Where can I find her?

309
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:07,118
She's dead. She was murdered.

310
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:42,910
- She was murdered.
- They won't cancel.

311
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:47,238
- Then make the arrival underground.
- They want a big show.

312
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:51,194
- We need proof.
- How about a dead president?

313
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:04,192
I'm pulling up all the accounts
Pam made, but it'll take time.

314
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:07,073
Fax me the list
as soon as you get them.

315
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:13,552
All agents in position.

316
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:20,629
- Please step back.
- Empty your pockets.

317
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:25,358
Thank you.

318
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:17,399
You're from Texas, right?

319
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:43,234
I'm sorry.

320
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:58,156
Frank! Watts is gonna shit
if he sees you!

321
00:44:58,360 --> 00:45:03,514
- Have you got a fax for me?
- Yeah, what is it? What's this about?

322
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:10,914
What the hell is going on, Frank?

323
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:26,428
James Carney.

324
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:44,835
Carney, James.

325
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:10,793
- What the hell is he doing here?
- I don't know.

326
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:15,155
- Who gave you permission...
- He's here. His name is Carney.

327
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:20,388
- I want the seating chart.
- Give him the chart.

328
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:50,838
Gun!

329
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:06,237
Stop! Put the gun down!

330
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:29,435
Get down!

331
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:37,358
Don't shoot!

332
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,072
Get him in the car!

333
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:48,199
Hold your fire!

334
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:56,954
Get out of his way!

335
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:00,151
He's got a hostage!

336
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:11,676
Raines to shooters.
If you have a shot, take it.

337
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:25,799
Nice view.

338
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:33,230
- What's the plan, Captain?
- It's your man. You tell me.

339
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:38,833
Get me sharpshooters
on the north and west towers.

340
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:42,396
Take the subject out.

341
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:00,476
You had the guts.
You took the bullet.

342
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:06,794
- I broke my damn ribs.
- Sorry, I wasn't aiming at you.

343
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:11,790
Where the hell are the shooters?

344
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:16,915
- West tower in place. No lights.
- No shot from the north.

345
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:20,669
A bulletproof vest
is a bit of a cheat.

346
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:25,237
- Otherwise, you played a good game.
- It's no game, Leary.

347
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:29,797
I was doing my job.
What do we do now?

348
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,753
Do you believe
in the nobility of suicide?

349
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:34,556
No.

350
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:38,349
But if you want to blow your head off,
be my guest.

351
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:44,396
Nicely put, but I don't want
to leave this world alone.

352
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:49,990
- West tower, do you have a shot?
- Negative, too dark. Target unclear.

353
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:57,708
- It's better to die with a friend.
- Friend? You're a damn killer!

354
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:01,629
I saved your life. You owe me.

355
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:06,675
- I don't owe you shit.
- I was always honest with you.

356
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:11,749
- Go ahead and shoot.
- It's Frank. Quiet!

357
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:14,952
<i>- Come on. </i>
- Are you talking to me?

358
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:18,516
- What are you waiting for?
- Waiting for?

359
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:22,395
I'm waiting for some gratitude.

360
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:26,991
Without me, you're a sad-eyed,
piano-playing drunk.

361
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:30,909
<i>I brought you into this game. </i>
<i>I let you keep up with me. </i>

362
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:34,670
- I made you a hero today.
- You didn't make me anything.

363
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:37,678
I redeemed your pathetic life.

364
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:40,753
I just did my job.
You're the one with a pathetic life.

365
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:45,715
<i>- Go ahead and shoot!</i>
- Lf they fire you'll be hit.

366
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:50,630
- I want you to thank me first.
- Shut up and shoot.

367
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:56,039
- All right, Frank.
- Stand by to fire on my command.

368
00:50:56,074 --> 00:50:58,319
- All right, Frank.
- Stand by to fire on my command.

369
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:03,954
- Sleep well, my friend.
- Just one thing, aim high.

370
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:06,549
- What?
- Aim high!

371
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:08,796
- Now!
- You bastard!

372
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:02,394
Take my hand.
If you don't, you'll die.

373
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:10,188
- You want to save me, Frank?
- To be honest, no. But it's my job.

374
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:18,274
Take it.

375
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:14,355
Are you okay?

376
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:21,355
We've worked with Agent Horrigan
for some time.

377
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:25,473
He exemplifies
courage and self-sacrifice. Frank!

378
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:30,199
I guess I overreacted again, Harry.

379
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:54,391
Agent Horrigan, why are you
retiring from the Secret Service?

380
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:58,912
Well, I hate desk work and I'm
too old for running around.

381
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:04,513
And thanks to all this press,
I'm no good for undercover work.

382
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:10,753
How are you, Frank?
The President sent his limo for you.

383
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:14,794
- That's the least he could do.
- Good. I love public transportation.

384
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:21,272
Come on in.

385
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:25,836
Make yourself at home.

386
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:41,476
- So, what do you think?
- I like it.

387
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:47,789
<i>Hello, Frank. By the time</i>
<i>you hear this, it'll be over. </i>

388
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:53,028
<i>The President is most likely dead</i>
<i>and so am I.</i>

389
00:54:53,240 --> 00:55:00,396
<i>Frank, did you kill me? Who won</i>
<i>our game? Not that it matters. </i>

390
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:07,119
<i>Among friends, like you and me, it's</i>
<i>how you play the game. The game's done. </i>

391
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:10,437
<i>It's time to get on with your life. </i>

392
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:15,270
<i>I worry that</i>
<i>you have no life to get on with. </i>

393
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:18,233
<i>You're a good man. </i>

394
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:22,399
<i>Good men, like you and me,</i>
<i>are destined to travel a lonely road. </i>

395
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:26,437
<i>Goodbye and good luck. </i>

396
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:35,348
I bet you that brown pigeon
flies off before the white one.

397
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:38,074
How do you know?

398
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:43,269
I know things about pigeons, Lilly.

399
