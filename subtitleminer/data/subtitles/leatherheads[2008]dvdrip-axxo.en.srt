00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,348
Hey, Carter, one more year
and you graduate.

2
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,158
- What's waiting for you out there?
- Don't know, Nate.

3
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,959
Get a job, make a couple bucks,
maybe even buy your paper.

4
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,871
- Will you miss football?
- Heck, yeah, I'll miss it,

5
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,359
- but what are you gonna do?
- Beats me.

6
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,318
- Nothing much you can do.
- You could always go pro.

7
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,312
You know, Stump,
there are several time-tested methods

8
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,153
for diverting the defence
from the ball carrier.

9
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,470
Throwing your body in front of them
with a certain amount of force.

10
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,357
- What, you mean blocking?
- Sounds kind of rough.

11
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,271
- You know, that could hurt, Dodge.
- Yes, it could.

12
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,917
Frank? You got to get me a blocker.

13
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,638
I've been thinking the same thinking, Dodge,

14
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,233
and I'm looking
at this high school kid over at Penrose.

15
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:14,153
- High school?
- Yeah, but he's mature for his age.

16
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,272
Like Bug over there?

17
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:29,080
57, 11...

18
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,879
No, forget the water bucket, Bug.
Go and get that ball!

19
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,313
It's the only ball we got.

20
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,792
Get rid of it.

21
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,636
- We're down to the third?
- Yeah.

22
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,472
Let's give them the Rin Tin Tin.

23
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,193
Okay, Coach,
we need another ball.

24
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:25,033
Well, ask them other fellas, why don't you?
That's the only ball we have.

25
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,192
Well, then, you better find one, and fast,
or you're gonna have to forfeit.

26
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,674
Forfeit?

27
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,630
- We're creaming these mutts.
- The home team provides the game ball.

28
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,029
You don't have another ball,
you forfeit the game. That's the rules.

29
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,270
Where's that written?
- It ain't written. It's just the rules.

30
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:41,079
- Well, I never heard of it.
- Maybe you're going deaf, old man.

31
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,236
Dear, there must be better ways
to promote the starch business.

32
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,191
Tough loss there, Dodge.

33
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:16,596
Hate to end a home stand like that
on a technicality.

34
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:20,117
- You ever heard of that rule?
- Me? No. I never heard of any rules.

35
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:23,795
My point exactly.
Goddamn rules are ruining the game.

36
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,032
Goddamn rules.

37
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,712
Bug, when you're done with the water,
grab my shaving kit from my suitcase.

38
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,711
Grab your own damn shaving kit!
- For Christ's sake, Frank,

39
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,199
how much can a football cost?

40
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,759
You think footballs are grown
out of thin air?

41
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,512
So, you get a few simoleons
from the Starch King.

42
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,352
Hey, Dodge, do I feel hot to you?

43
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,150
- No more than the next man.
- Fever runs in my family, you know.

44
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:45,033
Everything runs in your family, Ralph,
except your feet.

45
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,714
Look what you made me...
I have to start again.

46
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,837
It's no big joke.
You'll make us miss the train to Milwaukee.

47
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,992
- Milwaukee? What about Akron?
- Akron team folded day before yesterday.

48
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,514
- We gonna play Milwaukee instead.
- I can't go to Milwaukee.

49
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,431
- I got a wrestling match tonight.
- Get out of it.

50
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,192
- It pays $100.
- We'll see you when you get back.

51
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:03,078
- That's okay. I got this kid coming.
- The high school kid from Penrose?

52
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,799
Yeah. He can only practise after class,
but wait till you see him.

53
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,108
- When's he coming?
- He's gonna meet us

54
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,758
at the Waterford station
when the train stops.

55
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:12,515
- Hey, I got an extra fin coming my way.
- You lost that last game.

56
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,637
I did not. Dodge, didn't I have this tooth
today when we started the game?

57
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,917
Curly, I learnt long ago
never to stare directly into your face.

58
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,752
Show me the lost tooth,
I'll give you the 5.

59
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,478
If I had it, it wouldn't be lost.

60
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,393
- Ready, Suds?
- Yeah, shoot.

61
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:29,078
The Duluth Bulldogs
lost to the Toledo Bullets today

62
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,151
in a dirty game
of professional league football,

63
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:34,915
where a new and dangerous element
has been creeping in, rules.

64
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,560
- Goddamn rules.
- The lone moment of glory came...

65
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,638
Say, Joe.
- Nice hat, Lexie.

66
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,312
Thanks, I just bought it.

67
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:00,358
Listen, can you get me in a room
with Hank Kelly at the comptroller's desk?

68
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:04,035
- He won't talk to reporters in fancy hats.
- Hey, Lexie. You going hunting?

69
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:07,157
It's a very expensive hat,
your whole year's salary.

70
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,832
Harvey wants to see you in his office.

71
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,273
I'd take that mack off before you go in there.

72
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,999
- You would, would you?
- He might think there's an air raid.

73
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:17,073
Good, boys, complete sentences.
Next week, let's try paragraphs.

74
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:20,915
- Say, Pete, see about Hank Kelly, will you?
- He doesn't talk to reporters.

75
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,956
- Say, Harvey.
- Nice piñata.

76
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,951
- Don't you start.
- Pull up a chair.

77
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,799
Best seat in the house. Who are you, Sarge?

78
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,791
Mack Steiner. Lieutenant.

79
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,632
Lexie, I got one for you.

80
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,631
You ever hear of Carter Rutherford,
"the Bullet"?

81
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:36,599
Football boy? War hero football boy?

82
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,557
Good-looking war hero football boy.

83
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,596
Took time out
of college to fight the war.

84
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,671
Got a whole platoon of Jerries to surrender.

85
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:45,228
Just dropped their guns
and gave up from the sound of his voice.

86
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:48,118
You ought to hire him.
Get rid of this pack of geniuses.

87
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,031
- We're gonna do a story on him.
- What's your angle?

88
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,315
- It ain't true.
- It's all a crock.

89
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,032
The kid's doing radio shows
and advertisements.

90
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,031
He's hired a promoter named CC Frazier

91
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,633
to put himself
on the cover of every magazine.

92
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,154
I like those razors.
- Sure. Who doesn't?

93
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,873
So what's the story, Mack?

94
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:06,033
I served with him.
I was there in the Argonne. He ain't no hero.

95
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,839
You're gonna meet with Carter and CC.
He's gonna be in town next month.

96
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,275
And you're gonna do a story
on the virtues of the Bullet.

97
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,839
The many virtues!

98
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:16,959
And then we're gonna break the myth
of the War Hero Bullet.

99
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,757
Listen, you got fellas
who'd be perfect for this.

100
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,751
Three Knickerbockers out there,
for instance,

101
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,308
who'd trade their high school diplomas
for a crack at it.

102
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,477
- It's not my kind of story.
- Lexie,

103
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:32,757
<i>CC Frazier wants the Chicago Tribune
to do a story on his protégé.</i>

104
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,468
We're gonna oblige him,
and you're gonna do it.

105
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,990
Can I talk to you alone for a minute?

106
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,992
Captain, would you excuse us?

107
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:44,232
It's Lieutenant. I'll wait in the hall.

108
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,192
Thanks, Lieutenant.

109
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,235
Why me?

110
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,318
Because it's a big story and you're the best.

111
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,709
Thought you'd say
it's 'cause I have the best legs in the office.

112
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,789
No, Joe does.

113
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,794
Okay, Harvey, I'll make you a deal.

114
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,316
If I throw some facts together
about this Bombshell...

115
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,389
- Bullet.
- Bullet.

116
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,598
- And we chop down his apple tree...
- You get the assistant editor's desk.

117
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,674
Okay, Chief.

118
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:27,075
You get Mack's story,
and I'll get you your Bullet.

119
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:35,477
"The lone moment of glory
came in the 4th quarter,

120
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:38,597
"when Jimmy 'Dodge' Connelly
lateraled to Bakes Davis,

121
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:41,399
"who ran through a trio of open-field tackles

122
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,948
"and into the Duluth end zone.

123
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:47,749
"And whereas the hotly disputed contest
will go down in the books

124
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:52,072
"as a Toledo victory,
the hearts and minds of all who witnessed

125
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:56,870
"the classic gridiron confrontation
were clearly won by the Duluth Bulldogs."

126
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,798
- Awfully good, Suds.
- Sure is a great thing to read, Suds.

127
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:04,348
When the muse strikes, who am I to resist?

128
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,112
It's almost like
you were playing the game yourself.

129
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:10,273
What I try to achieve in my prose
is a sense of flight.

130
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,271
Now that's a crowd, ain't it, Dodge?

131
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,588
Sure is. We didn't have crowds
like that when I was in school.

132
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,113
You went to college?
- Colleges.

133
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:22,517
Waterford! Waterford next!

134
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,032
Waterford next!

135
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,114
Waterford!

136
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,958
Is that Big Gus Schiller?

137
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,678
- How you doing, boy?
- Hey, how you doing?

138
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,671
Here, get in this car.

139
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:51,553
Boys, I want you to be meeting
our newest player.

140
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:55,076
This is Big Gus Schiller
from Penrose High School.

141
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,600
Hi. How you doing? How's it going?

142
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:11,193
- So you're in high school, are you?
- Yeah.

143
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,152
Got held back, did you?

144
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,555
No.

145
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:53,518
Hey, kid, what position did you play
in high school?

146
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,195
Kicker.

147
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,232
- Kicker?
- What the hell?

148
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,672
Coach thought it'd be
the best position for me.

149
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:03,228
- Who's your coach?
- Math teacher.

150
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,435
Huddle up.

151
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,034
Hooked it.

152
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:36,399
17, 32, 24, hike!

153
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,473
God! Right in the...

154
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:49,794
Gus, look. You stand over here, next to him,
and you hit anybody that comes near him.

155
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,791
Anybody that comes near him!

156
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,874
41,

157
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:58,239
33, 37, hike!

158
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,273
Oh, I like him.

159
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,990
Dodge, I need to have a speech with you.

160
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,911
What do you mean folded?
Milwaukee can't fold.

161
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:38,039
They're broke, is what.
Like Akron. No money, no team.

162
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,592
We're broke, too.

163
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,077
- We're broke now? Our season just started!
- Look, we're broke, I'm telling you.

164
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,879
If you got no money to pay salaries,
no money to buy train tickets,

165
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,428
no money to rent a field, then you're broke.

166
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:55,151
It's over, Dodge.
It's time to pack it up and go home.

167
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:59,354
The Starch King is gonna sell us
51% of the team as soon as he can.

168
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,351
What's gonna happen to these guys?

169
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,075
I don't know.

170
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:12,070
And I thought the Milwaukee game
would turn it around,

171
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,628
what with Big Gus coming on board for us.

172
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,555
Milwaukee got Joe Washburn
playing good, but...

173
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,031
Now there's no Milwaukee game.

174
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,313
It's finished.

175
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,839
Half these guys will probably end up
back in the mines.

176
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,835
This isn't exactly the cream
of America's work force.

177
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,672
They don't have a lot of options.

178
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,235
Shit!

179
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,550
<i>I'll read you what he had to say.</i>

180
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,998
<i>"I regret to inform you that Perennial Starch</i>

181
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:50,073
<i>"is hereby terminating our sponsorship
of the Duluth Bulldogs."</i>

182
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,751
<i>So that's it, fellas.</i>

183
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,911
<i>It's the end of the line for us.</i>

184
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:01,350
<i>This will be your last paycheque.
From here on out, you're on your own.</i>

185
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:06,312
<i>But I want to say
what a privilege it's been to coach you boys.</i>

186
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,989
<i>What you've done on the field
has been amazing.</i>

187
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:14,159
<i>Big Gus, I want to say to you, son,
thank you for coming.</i>

188
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,550
- Name?
- Connelly.

189
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,914
Dodge Connelly.

190
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,552
- Age?
- 38.

191
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,309
39?

192
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:38,312
45. Skill?

193
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,793
How do you mean?

194
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,432
Are you a welder or a machinist
or a pipe fitter? You know, skills.

195
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,794
I got you.

196
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,359
Did you serve in the war?

197
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,834
- Yes.
- Well, you must have learnt a trade there.

198
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,712
Not one you'd like.

199
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,039
Mr Connelly, if you have no trade skills,

200
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:08,476
how have you made a living
in the last 20 years?

201
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:18,473
- A cup of coffee. How much is coffee?
- 10 cents.

202
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,189
Here's 15. You keep it.

203
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,432
Now I can buy that house I always wanted.

204
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,476
<i>And while
only halfway through the Princeton season,</i>

205
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:29,473
<i>Carter "the Bullet" Rutherford
has piled on a whopping 14 touchdowns</i>

206
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,596
<i>and 720 yards.</i>

207
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,591
<i>We spoke to the Medal of Honor winner
after the game.</i>

208
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,480
<i>- Carter, how you feeling?
- Feel pretty good, Mac.</i>

209
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:39,313
<i>Their defence just kept coming at you,
but I figured I might get around them</i>

210
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,958
<i>if I just put my mind to it.</i>

211
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,871
<i>Guess I've learnt something
from dodging those Jerries.</i>

212
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,714
<i>And that's the kind of
bravery on display every Saturday, folks.</i>

213
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:50,076
<i>The kind of fearlessness
that brings in those fans by the thousands.</i>

214
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,754
<i>Some 40,000 people on hand
just last Saturday.</i>

215
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,910
<i>Now here's a little ditty
I'm sure you'll all know.</i>

216
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,752
40,000 people?

217
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,958
I'm trying to reach CC Frazier.
Do you know how...

218
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,152
Well, why can't you tell me?

219
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,119
Listen, my name's Connelly.
It's about football.

220
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,231
I've never heard of you, either, Miss.

221
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,152
No, what I... Hello?

222
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,074
Sheez!

223
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,750
- 'Cause I said I liked your dress?
- Stop saying that!

224
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,068
- It's true.
- It's boring.

225
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:00,152
- It's all I wanted to say.
- I'm starting to think it's all you can say.

226
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,559
- What's your name?
- Leonard.

227
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:04,438
Leonard, you better run along
before my fiancé gets here.

228
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,875
He's far less tolerant
of your existence than I am.

229
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,474
There's no reason to be angry.
I was simply paying you a compliment.

230
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:13,348
Stop it. You're just acting like a big baby
'cause you miss your mother's bosoms.

231
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,677
- My mother's what?
- Her bosoms, you goof!

232
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,751
You're substituting my bosoms
for your mother's.

233
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:22,674
- What? No, I'm not.
- Why not? What's wrong with my bosoms?

234
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,956
Honestly, Miss Littleton,
we're in public. The rules of etiquette apply.

235
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:34,396
Leonard, it's 1925. There are no rules.

236
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,948
Except that boys like you are tedious
until they're 40,

237
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:39,315
at which point
they become unbearably tedious.

238
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:42,915
- I didn't come over here to be insulted.
- No? Where do you usually go?

239
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,912
And don't think
just 'cause you haven't said anything

240
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,513
that I don't know what you're up to.

241
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,478
I'm talking to you, behind the magazine.

242
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:57,598
Don't you know I could have you arrested
for eavesdropping?

243
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,752
- Excuse me?
- Or are you really an avid reader

244
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,115
<i>- of Ladies' Home Journal?
- I never miss an issue.</i>

245
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,435
I see.

246
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,271
- Waiting for someone?
- I'm sorry, were you speaking to me?

247
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,272
No, just practising my American accent.
Of course I was speaking to you.

248
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,713
As a matter of fact,
I was waiting for someone.

249
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,631
- Who?
- A business associate.

250
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:17,190
A business associate. So cryptic. So manly.

251
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,238
Clearly beyond the comprehension
of a feeble female.

252
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,635
If you say so.

253
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,549
What I want to know is why you chose
to come in here from the lobby,

254
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,914
where you obviously had business,

255
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,150
to sit next to me
and listen to my conversation?

256
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,757
Tell me. Or are you afraid to say?

257
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,913
I'm not afraid to say it.

258
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,279
I'm in love with Leonard.

259
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:37,949
Go ahead and laugh, everyone does.

260
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:40,315
We had something beautiful
until you came along.

261
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,914
You think you can just toss him away
like a sack of flour.

262
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,037
- That's funny.
- Hey, haven't you done enough?

263
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,997
No, really, who are you?

264
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,672
- What's your name?
- I'm Dodge.

265
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:53,389
- Dodge Connelly of Duluth, Minnesota.
- Lexie Littleton. Champaign, Illinois.

266
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:57,314
Hey, Lexie, what are you doing for dinner?

267
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,752
You're a lot of fun, Mr Connelly,

268
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,751
and I'm sorry
I'm not gonna get to know you better,

269
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:05,958
but you should leave
before my fiancé gets here. He's kind of big.

270
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,509
- I can handle myself.
- No, really, Mr Connelly.

271
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,592
Mr Connelly is buried next to my mother.
I'm Dodge.

272
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:15,752
- Dodge, it'd be better if you go.
- Better for whom?

273
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,591
Don't get familiar, Mr Connelly.

274
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:22,069
Just because we had a laugh
doesn't mean you know me.

275
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:27,117
- My apologies.
- Apology accepted.

276
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,358
But I do know you.

277
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,757
- You think so?
- Oh, yeah.

278
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:33,875
- Really?
- Yeah.

279
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,439
You're the kind of cocktail
that comes on like sugar,

280
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,873
but gives you a kick in the head.

281
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,791
The only thing you hate worse
than a guy making a play

282
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,313
is when a guy doesn't make a play.

283
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,231
Were you making a play? I hadn't realised.

284
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,476
It might work on my Aunt Lurleen.
She's a little near-sighted.

285
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:48,109
There's an article on peach-canning in here
that I'm dying to get back to.

286
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,232
Well, I know you, too, Dodge Connelly.

287
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,118
You think you're the slickest operator
in Duluth, and maybe you are,

288
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,636
but being the slickest operator in Duluth is
kind of like being the world's tallest midget,

289
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,597
- if you ask me.
- It's too bad we know each other so well.

290
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,999
- We might have gotten along.
- Well, I'll live.

291
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,274
Alone.

292
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,554
Lexie?

293
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,390
Mr Frazier, Lexie Littleton.

294
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,952
I do apologise for keeping you waiting.

295
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:15,432
- So, where is this cute boyfriend of mine?
- Well, I thought he was behind me.

296
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,153
There he is now.

297
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:22,917
He finds it very difficult
moving around in public.

298
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,954
Carter.

299
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,715
Say, CC!

300
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,872
He loves his fans.

301
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:34,315
<i>Carter, this is Miss Littleton of the Tribune.
She's doing a piece on you.</i>

302
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,958
Well, that'll be fine.

303
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,315
- A pleasure, Mr Rutherford.
- Carter, Miss Littleton.

304
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,719
Lexie, Carter.

305
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,956
- Say, CC...
- There you are.

306
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,991
Could you bring the car around?
We're ready to leave.

307
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,389
- I don't think this gentleman works here.
- No?

308
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,755
He certainly looks like the retrieving type.

309
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:54,438
- Do you work here, Dodge?
- No, CC, I came to talk to you.

310
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:59,150
Yes, well, I'm afraid we're going to dinner.
Come, let's find a real valet, shall we?

311
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:05,517
I have $20,000
that says you might want to talk.

312
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,391
So if I understand you correctly,
Mr Connelly,

313
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:12,517
it's your intention
to legitimise professional football?

314
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,431
- That's right.
- Well, let me say straight off,

315
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,875
there's no such beast
as professional football.

316
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:20,874
There's only miners and farmers and
shell-shocked veterans of the Great War,

317
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,712
smashing each other's skulls together

318
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:25,837
in a million turnip fields
from Duluth to East Jesus.

319
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,472
Now I ask you,
how do you intend to legitimise that?

320
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,309
By keeping it alive, by investing in a team.

321
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,790
Well, you see, there's the catch.
I'm not interested in investing.

322
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:40,670
I'm more of a 20-percenter.
New talent, new ideas interest me.

323
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,156
Professional football
does not attract new talent,

324
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:46,596
and investing in a professional
football team is not a new idea.

325
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,673
Dodge,

326
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:52,479
we had some laughs a few years ago.

327
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,869
- You had some laughs.
- Yes.

328
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,671
Yes, I guess I did.

329
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,589
- So...
- Okay.

330
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,232
How about this for a new idea?

331
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,119
Carter Rutherford leaves Princeton
to play for the Duluth Bulldogs.

332
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,872
- What?
- Hear me out.

333
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,757
Carter, you're a pretty remarkable guy,
aren't you?

334
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,836
- I just play football.
- You don't have to be modest with me.

335
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:13,989
I know your story.

336
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,117
How you put your education on hold
to serve your country, to fight in the war.

337
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,474
I was just doing what I thought was right.

338
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,152
The President
gave you a medal for bravery.

339
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,231
I was just in
the right place at the right time.

340
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,471
That's not what the papers said.
They called you the hero of the Argonne.

341
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:28,438
Then, when you went back to school,
you turned out to be a football hero, too.

342
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,511
- Mr Connelly, I'm just a guy...
- Carter.

343
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,349
Do kids chase you down the hallway
at school?

344
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,429
Sometimes.

345
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,397
Follow you around?
Ask you for an autograph?

346
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,119
It happens, yeah,
but you can't take that stuff too seriously.

347
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,839
You feel like sometimes
everybody wants something from you?

348
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,871
And how are you compensated for living
your life under that kind of public scrutiny?

349
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,839
By paying tuition to Princeton.

350
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:00,592
Let me ask you a question.
Do you like playing football?

351
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,268
I love playing football.

352
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:05,113
Good. You got one more year and that's it.
That's all she wrote.

353
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,919
What are you gonna do then?

354
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,430
Actually, I've already been accepted
to Yale Law School.

355
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,431
I have a position waiting for me
at Hager, Danes and Upton

356
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,078
when I get my law degree.

357
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:16,197
It turns out, I'm not too bad a student,
when I put my mind to it.

358
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:21,116
You... That's good. It's good.

359
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,557
And all of that will be waiting for you,
no question about it.

360
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,312
But the world's full of good lawyers.

361
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,709
In football,
there's only one Carter Rutherford.

362
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:31,678
You don't need any more teaching
to be what you are out on the field.

363
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:35,833
You ought to be playing football, and
you ought to be rewarded for your talent.

364
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,110
Makes sense. Sort of.

365
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:43,549
So did bloodletting at the time.

366
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,470
You're very passionate, Mr Connelly.
What exactly do you have in mind?

367
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,830
Carter Rutherford takes a temporary leave
from Princeton to play for Duluth,

368
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:58,631
and in exchange
he is guaranteed $5,000 a game.

369
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,393
Let's you and I have another drink,
Mr Connelly.

370
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,799
You're the boss.

371
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:10,269
Why don't you two run along,
conduct your interview,

372
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:13,517
whilst Mr Connelly and I
thrash out your future?

373
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,793
Come on, Carter.

374
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,071
Carter Rutherford wouldn't sit on a bench
for that kind of money.

375
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,513
Did I say 5? I meant 10.

376
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,318
I assume you'll be paying this
out of the gate receipts?

377
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,118
- That's right.
- Of course, I'll want it in the form

378
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,919
of a guarantee.
Plus I get a percentage of the overages.

379
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,070
Of course. In the neighbourhood of 5%.

380
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,072
I was thinking a little more uptown.

381
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,190
- 10?
- 25.

382
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:47,157
I'll understand if you decline.
Most teams would.

383
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,670
Most, but not all.

384
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,953
<i>Sudsy? Listen up.</i>

385
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:03,713
<i>Carter Rutherford's gonna be playing
for the Duluth Bulldogs starting Sunday.</i>

386
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:07,110
We're... What? No, just listen.
We're taking a Pullman to Duluth tonight.

387
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,555
We're gonna get there in the morning.
Round up everybody you can.

388
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:12,837
Get the word around. I want a nice
welcoming committee when we pull in.

389
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:16,276
What? Just trust me. Thanks, pal.

390
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:21,112
Harvey, change of plans. I'm taking a train
with these knuckleheads to Duluth.

391
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,590
What? No, I haven't been drinking!
It's a long story.

392
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:27,513
Just give me a few days.
Hey, how'd it go with Mack Steiner?

393
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,512
So don't use his name.

394
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:32,558
Believe me, Harvey, by the end of the week,
this kid will cook his own goose.

395
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,633
I got to go.

396
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,713
Hey, what are you doing?

397
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,315
Sorry.

398
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:05,392
You know, truth be told,
I was a better baseball player.

399
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,835
But college baseball isn't too popular.

400
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:11,915
What about the war?
Where'd all that courage come from?

401
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,151
I don't know about courage.

402
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:17,119
A platoon of German soldiers
surrendered to you.

403
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:20,557
Quite a few have made a lot
out of much less.

404
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,671
Let's talk about something else.

405
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,830
Like, how did Miss Lexie Littleton
get so curious

406
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:29,993
- she worked her way up a newspaper room?
- Not really the homemaker type.

407
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,710
Depends on the home, I guess.

408
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,953
This is me.

409
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:51,399
- An eventful day, Mr Bullet.
- Good night, Lexie.

410
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:55,357
Bright and early, Bullet.
You got a big day ahead.

411
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,514
Hey, Lexie,

412
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:05,678
you think I did the right thing
about this Duluth deal?

413
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:09,517
I think you did the right thing
about the Duluth deal.

414
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,794
Well, I'm glad.

415
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,551
I'm happy you're glad.

416
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,554
Good night.

417
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,872
I'm glad you're glad.

418
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,909
You've got a lot of moxie!

419
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,356
I didn't know it was your berth.
I would have armed myself.

420
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,715
I'm calling the porter.

421
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:35,155
- I'm not decent.
- Well, there's an understatement!

422
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,275
Neither are you.

423
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:38,271
- You looked?
- I glanced.

424
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,552
- Need help with that hook?
- No.

425
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,909
- Good evening.
- Yes, it is.

426
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,639
You know, this may seem a little awkward

427
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,518
coming from the man
who only promotes the man of your dreams,

428
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,192
but I've had a little thought.

429
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:03,513
- Perhaps it can wait till tomorrow?
- Probably, but that's not my style.

430
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:07,150
You see, Miss Littleton,
Carter is very important to me.

431
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,310
I want to make sure you treat him fairly
in your newspaper.

432
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,789
- I resent the implication that I wouldn't.
- Lexie,

433
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:14,917
Carter is good for the country.
He's a war hero.

434
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:18,396
<i>Good for the Tribune, they sell newspapers.
Good for me.</i>

435
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,119
- Good for you.
- Lexie...

436
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:26,076
I'm having a conversation
with a rather beautiful woman,

437
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:29,437
and she and I were wondering
if you'd care to join us for a nightcap?

438
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,988
- Good night, CC.
- Good night, Lexie.

439
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,758
- What?
- I think I'll sleep up here tonight.

440
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:44,075
You most certainly will not!

441
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,759
Really?

442
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:49,270
"Believe me, Harvey, by the end of the week,
this kid will cook his own goose."

443
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:52,398
- You were spying on me!
- I was observing.

444
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:55,995
- So, you want to play dirty?
- Maybe later. I'm a little tired right now.

445
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,033
So here we are.

446
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,958
- Not sure what the next move is.
- It happens.

447
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,959
- It's the first time for me.
- They all say that.

448
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:17,199
- I'm sure you snore.
- Attagirl!

449
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:20,432
Listen, I'm sorry
if what I said today upset you.

450
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,234
Don't be.

451
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,958
- Which part?
- The "kick in the head" part.

452
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,793
It's forgotten.

453
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:33,675
- I'm sorry if what I said today upset you.
- Don't be.

454
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:38,477
- Which part?
- The "tallest midget" part.

455
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,472
What about the "I know you" part?

456
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:44,477
- I still mean that.
- Then I'm still upset.

457
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:38,513
You're the tops!
- Hey, Carter!

458
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,074
Carter! Carter!

459
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:52,311
It's a three-ring circus
with Carter as the dancing bear.

460
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,152
Yeah.
Wonder what that makes us.

461
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,277
Dodge, look, look!
Welcome to show business!

462
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:58,874
Hi!

463
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,192
When's the last
Princeton game, Carter?

464
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,872
I guess I already played it.

465
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,871
So, you going to shake up the team?
Anybody you want fired?

466
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:12,430
No, no, no, of course not. I'm not the coach.
Besides, they're a great bunch of players.

467
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,158
Hey, where the hell is everybody?

468
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:25,073
CC moved practise over to Ennis Field,
at the university.

469
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,389
What?

470
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,395
Why?

471
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,354
Is it illustrated?

472
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,759
- You're late.
- Says who?

473
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,319
It's 8:30. You're late.

474
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,789
- How's your story coming?
- Swell, thanks.

475
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,313
Cooked his goose yet?

476
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,637
You get crowds like this
when you practised?

477
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,950
- By the thousands.
- Yeah, I'll bet.

478
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,029
Dodge!

479
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:27,120
You saw the crowd? For a practise!

480
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:31,154
I tell you, our shit has really come in!
And look at this!

481
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:36,633
- That must make you happy, huh?
- It must.

482
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:43,712
- Hey, Dodge, you see the new uniforms?
- Can you believe it?

483
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:44,789
Yeah.

484
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,916
Hey, Dodgie, look at this thing!

485
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,877
- Brand spanking new!
- Nice.

486
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,712
- Say, Dodge.
- Hey, Dodge.

487
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:51,989
Hey, fellas.

488
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,115
Say, Dodge,
you missed callisthenics.

489
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,918
- Thank God!
- Couple of plays we ran at Princeton.

490
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,638
- A couple?
- Now, I was thinking,

491
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:59,153
we should switch
to the Single Back Formation

492
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,196
rather than sticking with the Wing.
What do you think?

493
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,430
Well, the Single Back's good,
but, see, the way we ran the team...

494
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:06,990
- Which one is me?
- That's you, right there, behind the guard.

495
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:09,355
I guess I should get a couple of diagrams
of the plays we run.

496
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:13,513
Sure. Yeah. These are a lot like your plays,
only a little more effective.

497
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:17,115
- Well, a lot of our plays are pretty strong.
- Some yes, some no.

498
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:19,920
But all that matters is that we win.
We want to win, don't we, boys?

499
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,479
Yeah!
- You said it, Carter!

500
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:25,598
Hey, they're here! Come on, fellas!

501
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,718
- You're a 10.5, right, Dodge?
- 11.

502
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,999
<i>Well, today's the big day, folks.</i>

503
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:59,799
<i>Princeton's Carter Rutherford is playing
his first professional game,</i>

504
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:02,838
<i>and it's right here at Ennis Field
with Duluth's own Bulldogs.</i>

505
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,433
<i>People have been coming in
to town all week</i>

506
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:07,432
<i>from locations as far as Akron, Ohio
and Lexington, Kentucky</i>

507
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:10,080
<i>just to get a glimpse of the 6'3" phenom.</i>

508
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:13,836
<i>Tickets are 75 cents adults
and 25 cents for the rascals under 12.</i>

509
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,911
<i>And if you're a Huskers fan, it's $10.</i>

510
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,991
<i>Just kidding, gang.
We love those Cleveland fans.</i>

511
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:20,112
<i>See you at the game.</i>

512
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:36,792
Come on, folks! Root for Carter!
Go, Bulldogs!

513
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,910
They're calling for rain today, boys.

514
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:54,512
- Hey! What's a girl doing in the press box?
- Rutherford says she knows her stuff.

515
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:57,194
Yeah? I'm thinking maybe he knows
her stuff.

516
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,399
<i>- Who you write for, honey?
- Tribune, fatso.</i>

517
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:06,269
- Since when do they cover pro football?
- Since I decided to write about it.

518
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:13,915
- You planning on taking notes?
- No. Got a mind like an elephant.

519
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,675
It's like the Library of Congress up there.
Nothing gets lost. Nothing gets stolen.

520
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,239
- Ain't that right, Bob?
- Bill!

521
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,514
Here we go.

522
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:53,551
2, 34, hike!

523
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,150
That Carter is really something, huh?

524
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,711
Great catch, Dodge.
- Nice, Dodge.

525
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,798
23, hike!

526
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:44,837
13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5,

527
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:49,158
4, 3, 2, 1!

528
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:50,349
Bulldogs!

529
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,392
See you, boys.

530
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:10,876
<i>"In his eagerly awaited debut
as a professional football player,</i>

531
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:14,714
<i>"Carter 'the Bullet' Rutherford
ran for an astonishing 162 yards.</i>

532
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:18,158
"Given his reported salary,
that's nearly $100 a yard.

533
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:21,038
"But the fleet-footed newcomer
earned every penny.

534

"Unstoppable, unbeatable and uncatchable,

"the Bullet has arrived, and pro football

00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:29,912
"will never be the same."

537
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,879
Well, he had a little help out there, Dodge.
You sure you want me to write it like that?

538
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:36,599
- We didn't fold, did we?
- No, we didn't fold, Dodge.

539
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:43,200
- He's a hell of a player.
- Yeah.

540
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:53,079
- And what do you get out of all this?
- 10% of your gross income.

541
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:54,715
10% of our...

542
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:58,713
It's very little, when you consider
how much I can increase your salary.

543
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:03,436
Well, just ask Carter.
MGM wants to sign him to a contract.

544
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,238
You think that
I could be in the movies?

545
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:07,515
Sure, Zoom. Just buy a ticket.

546
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:11,115
Now, I want you to peruse
this diet and exercise plan,

547
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,760
which Carter has evolved
for aspiring athletes.

548
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:19,360
The Rutherford Diet, patent pending,
is based on scientific research.

549
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:40,075
So, tell me,
where could I find a Lexie Littleton?

550
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:45,114
- Chicago, I guess. There are a lot of us.
- Well, then I'm going to Chicago.

551
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:48,874
How old are you?

552
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,837
- A gentleman doesn't ask...
- I'm not a gentleman.

553
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:53,639
I'm a football player. Are you 30?

554
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:59,476
I'm just shy of that mark, thank you.
How old are you? 24?

555
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:02,438
Just past that mark, thank you.

556
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,350
- That's a lie.
- Yes, it is.

557
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,990
- I'm 31.
- Yup.

558

<i>Do you have a question?</i>

559
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:20,998
<i>Pro football's got
a completely different style, Carter.</i>

560
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:23,514
<i>They play two, three games a week.
How do you plan on adjusting to that?</i>

561
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:26,319
<i>Well,
maybe they'll kind of adjust to me.</i>

562
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:32,711
<i>There goes the gun.
Is it possible, folks?</i>

Lexie.

580

- I know, Harvey.
- It's been four weeks. Where's my war hero?

Everyone's a little coy.
This story will loosen them up.

582
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,119
Just give me a little more time.

583
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:27,272
I just don't want another sports fan
writing a love letter.

584
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:29,351
Dust off that editor's desk, Harvey.

585
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:31,032
Assistant editor.

586
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:44,238
Stump, feel like crashing a gin mill or two?

587
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:46,880
No, thanks, Dodge. Some other time, maybe.

588
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:52,878
Hey, what do you say, Curly?
Feel like hitting the town?

589
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:55,030
No, I'm hitting the hay instead, Dodge.
Sorry.

590
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:59,117
Zoom, you old lounge lizard,
what do you say?

591
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:01,589
Gee, Dodge, I can't. There's a curfew.

592
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:03,995
A curfew? Since when?

593
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:05,752
We voted on the train.

594
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:07,194
Where was I?

595
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:08,999
Asleep.

596
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:40,635
I would have left you, too.
- Was that a bad move? I sent her flowers.

597
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:43,280
Well, then all is forgiven.

598
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:45,912
Yes, it is.

599
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:54,870
Why don't you like to talk
about the Argonne?

600
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:58,550
- Who's asking?
- Just me.

601
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:02,710
Stories get bigger over time.

602
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:06,077
- You never went to France.
- No, not that big.

603
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:09,119
Everything they say happened, happened.

604
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:12,796
It's just that the telling of it gets
a little better.

605
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:14,713
How much better?

606
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:20,471
We were pinned down in a gully.

607
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:24,479
We were there about three days, I guess.

608
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:27,030
It had been raining for about a week.

609
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:29,912
So some of the fellas and I,

610
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:33,596
<i>we hunkered down in a foxhole,
and we just waited for the weather to break.</i>

611
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:36,639
<i>A writer from The Times was with us.</i>

612
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:41,278
<i>Now, you know I never drink,
but it was so cold and so wet.</i>

613
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:44,071
<i>I started to
take a few slugs off a flask.</i>

614
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:46,310
Easy there, Carter.
That stuff will melt your teeth.

615
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:47,709
<i>Ja! Sehr gut.</i>

616
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:51,270
<i>- Tell me again. Ich gebe surrender?
- Auf.</i>

617
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:55,478
<i>Ich gebe auf. If you have no way out,
you lay down your rifle</i>

618
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:58,518
<i>and yell, "Ich gebe auf,"
otherwise they'll shoot you.</i>

619
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:00,678
<i>Ich gebe auf!</i>

620
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:04,318
<i>We were nearly out of ammo,
we were down to about nine fellas,</i>

621
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:06,868
and we had this plan
that we were gonna speak enough German

622
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:10,555
to get us out of there.
Take our chances in a war camp.

623
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:14,395
All through the night the fighting continued,
until we were all out of ammo.

624
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:19,192
Sitting ducks.
And we had been up for 36 hours.

625
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:21,752
<i>That, and the drinking...</i>

626
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:24,400
Okay, fellas,
we ain't taking this spot any time soon.

627
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:26,391
So let's call it a night and try again.

628
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:42,390
<i>I don't know how long I was there.</i>

629
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:44,199
<i>But it had to have been a few hours,</i>

630
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:46,794
<i>because by that time,
the Jerries had taken the foxhole.</i>

631
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:49,759
<i>But I was so covered up, they never saw me.</i>

632
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:51,353
<i>And I never saw them.</i>

633
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:07,512
<i>I knew we were goners, so I jumped up,
and I yelled, "Ich gebe auf!"</i>

634
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:13,230
<i>- Ich gebe auf!
- Ich gebe auf!</i>

635
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:16,957
<i>They thought I was one of them,
so they just dropped their weapons.</i>

636
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:19,830
<i>They just gave up.</i>

637
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:27,359
<i>Ich gebe auf! I'm unarmed!</i>

638
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:31,115
<i>And it was right about then
that I started to have a really bad feeling.</i>

639
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:32,709
Carter?

640
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:34,119
<i>When it was all sorted out,</i>

641
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:36,953
<i>the Lieutenant thought it was best
if we all just kept our mouths shut.</i>

642
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:38,473
<i>One for The Times, Private.</i>

643
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:40,710
<i>Let the chips fall where they may.</i>

644
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:44,310
<i>And then the story got bigger.</i>

645
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:46,232
The President gave you a medal.

646
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:49,154
I would have made liars out of all the fellas.

647
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:50,389
We were stuck.

648
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:53,109
That's a lot of responsibility
for a young man.

649
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:55,672
I grew up pretty fast.

650
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:00,872
It's quite a story.

651
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:02,953
And now you know.

652
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:07,433
Are we still friends?

653
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:21,516
There's this one joint off of Halstead
that's at the bottom of a meat locker.

654
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:25,036
Hey, Mikey. And you have to walk
through all this meat,

655
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:28,556
like hanging beef, like beef, like bacon beef.

656
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:31,200
And by the time you get in there,
you smell like a brewery.

657
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:33,191
Butcher shop.
- Butcher shop.

658
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:36,238
Mr Ziegfeld says that I'm the best dancer
in the line-up.

659
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:37,548
- You don't say.
- Yeah.

660
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:40,074
My kicks are so high
that I almost knock myself out.

661
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:41,991
That's dangerous.
- Yeah, well...

662
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:43,593
And I'm super flexible, too.

663
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:46,148
I can arch my back
so that my head hits my heels.

664
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:47,878
Watch yourself there.

665
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:51,640
Is Carter Rutherford very tall?
'Cause he looks really tall.

666
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:53,278
But maybe that's just because
you're kind of short.

667
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:54,349
Hey.

668
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:59,430
- Hiya, Dodge. Come on in.
- Hey, Sully.

669
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:22,559
- Evening, Dodge.
- Mr Mayor.

670
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:24,634
You know the Mayor?

671
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:27,228
I ought to. I voted for him five times
in the last election.

672
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:32,993
Well, if it isn't Dodge Connelly,
middle-aged boy wonder.

673
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:35,879
Why, Lexie Littleton, breaking curfew.

674
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:37,952
I won't tell if you don't.

675
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:42,478
Let me introduce you
to Miss Belinda Whippleworth.

676
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:44,113
- A pleasure.
- Charmed.

677
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:45,952
I have to pee.

678
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:52,392
Enchanting girl. I thought you had to be 21
to get into a place like this.

679
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:53,834
She is 21.

680
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,069
I meant her IQ.

681
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:56,912
I wasn't planning on running her
for Congress.

682
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:59,679
No? What were you planning
on doing with her?

683
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:01,239
You know, the usual.

684
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:04,199
Put her in shoulder pads and a helmet,
and knock her brains out?

685
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:05,833
I think somebody beat me to it.

686
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,069
She'll do well in Congress.

687
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:09,390
You're only as young
as the women you feel.

688
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:14,152
How quiet it must be at the Algonquin
with you here in Duluth.

689
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:19,270
So, are you flying solo,
or is the Bullet casting about?

690
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:23,794
What do you care?
You're here to entertain Miss Nipplewidth.

691
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:26,713
It wouldn't look good for you
to get caught in a place like this.

692
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:30,634
I'd dare say it wouldn't look good
for anyone to be caught in a place like this.

693
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:48,552
Come on, let's dance.

694
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:52,869
Hey.

695
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:56,793
Come on.

696
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:40,272
What happened tonight?

697
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:45,828
Our boy's taken a liking to yours truly.

698
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:48,150
Seems mutual, if you ask me.

699
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:49,958
So much so

700
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:54,670
that he felt compelled to clear his
conscience on his Sergeant York routine.

701
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:59,555
You mean he didn't take out a whole platoon
with a bow and arrow?

702
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:39,111
It's a raid! Let's go!

703
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:41,430
Everybody beat it! Get out of here!

704
00:53:58,160 --> 00:53:59,434
Wait, wait, wait!

705
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:09,835
Go, go.

706
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:35,834
Would you have someone bring a bottle
of whisky and some ice to Room 404?

707
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:37,433
I'm sorry, sir, we don't...

708
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:39,590
Of course, sir. Excuse me for one minute.

709
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:43,637
Ambassador Hotel.

710
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:44,835
Excuse me?

711
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:47,351
I'm sorry,
Miss Littleton is out for the evening.

712
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:48,873
May I take a message?

713
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:51,599
And who shall I say is calling?

714
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:53,033
Harvey?

715
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:55,350
<i>Yes. From the Tribune.</i>

716
00:54:56,800 --> 00:55:00,475
Yes, "Boy Wonder." Right.

717
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:03,150
Yes. "Cook his..."

718
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:06,678
I'm sorry, how do you spell that?
Oh, "goose."

719
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:08,557
Yes, good. All right.

720
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:10,631
Thank you... Thank you, Harvey.

721
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:15,000
Stop, you two! Stop or I shoot!

722
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:17,237
- He says he'll shoot!
- He always says that.

723
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:21,238
I thought
you said he always says that!

724
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:23,231
He does, just before he shoots.

725
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:34,148
Give me that.

726
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,672
Don't do it!

727
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:53,075
We got your mother here.
She wants to talk to you!

728
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:56,189
Johnny, come on down, Son!

729
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:58,398
Let's talk about this!

730
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:00,869
I don't want to live any more!

731
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:09,432
Johnny, please come down!

732
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:10,915
No!

733
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:13,791
All right, follow my lead.

734
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:16,512
We don't want to live any more, either!

735
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:21,192
Who are you?

736
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:24,673
What difference does it make?
We're going to kill ourselves!

737
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:29,435
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
Don't do anything drastic!

738
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:31,034
It's too late!

739
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:32,235
Come on.

740
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:35,112
Goodbye, cruel world!

741
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:37,952
Here they come!

742
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:41,193
Thanks, fellas!

743
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:46,070
Hey, look, there's two more!

744
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:53,474
Mom?

745
00:56:58,560 --> 00:56:59,788
Say, CC.

746
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:01,518
Did you say anything
to Miss Littleton tonight

747
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:03,955
that might compromise your service record?

748
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:06,076
- No.
- She's a reporter, Carter.

749
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:08,071
No, nothing she'd repeat.

750
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:10,996
- Let me buy you a drink.
- I don't drink.

751
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:12,195
You will.

752
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:27,629
So then he jumps up
and he yells, "I give up!" in German,

753
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:30,109
and the Jerries think he's one of them,
because of the rain and the mud.

754
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:31,599
You got a little soot in your eye.

755
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:35,036
So you see, he's not this big war hero, but...

756
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:36,835
I don't know.

757
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:39,673
<i>Ich gebe auf. Do you know what
that means? Ich gebe auf?</i>

758
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:42,399
"I give up" or something.
Here, close your eye.

759
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:43,789
Let me see.

760
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:47,753
Now let me see.

761
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:54,874
That's got it.

762
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:06,471
You know that sad Sunday night feeling
you'd get

763
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:09,279
when you knew the next day
you'd be back in school?

764
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,560
I've got that feeling right now.

765
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:17,675
Listen.

766
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:22,797
You wouldn't be surprised to hear
that I'm nuts about you.

767
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:25,432
You got guys telling you...

768
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:45,716
- I've got some decisions to make.
- In a minute.

769
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:00,072
Come on, I'll walk you.

770
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:25,598
CC tells me you're printing that story.

771
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,115
I haven't decided.

772
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:30,715
- You're not a reporter. You're a liar.
- Slow down there, Kaiser.

773
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:33,633
<i>If you just wanted a story, then why
didn't the Trib send one of their hacks</i>

774
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:35,358
with a cigar stuffed in their snout?

775
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:38,159
But, no,
they sent you to snuggle up and play nice.

776
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:40,959
I never was much for cigars,
but if it'd make you feel better...

777
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:43,429
Maybe I should just leave $20
on the bed stand.

778
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,228
Take it easy, Carter.

779
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:49,072
I thought you liked me.

780
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:50,957
Look, she's too old for you.

781
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:53,600
What? Well, you're too old for me!

782
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:55,318
You got me on that one.

783
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:56,992
Why I ever let you...

784
00:59:57,600 --> 00:59:59,352
Wait. Where were you two?

785
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:02,552
- Out.
- Nowhere.

786
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:03,834
Did you kiss her?

787
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:05,956
- Now, wait a minute!
- I want answers!

788
01:00:06,040 --> 01:00:09,794
Yeah, I kissed her! On the mouth, twice!
And I liked it a lot.

789
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:11,472
- You did, did you?
- Yeah.

790
01:00:11,560 --> 01:00:12,879
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

791
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:15,428
Okay, well, we can do this right here,
or we can go outside.

792
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:16,509
Get him, Dodge.

793
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:17,635
- We got a game in five days.
- What?

794
01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:19,312
- What, you think you're gonna hurt me?
- I might.

795
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:21,277
- Did you hear what he just called me?
- He's a little drunk.

796
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:23,590
I am not drunk, you coward!

797
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:25,033
Really? 'Cause your sleeve's on fire.

798
01:00:25,120 --> 01:00:26,678
Really?

799
01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:32,510
You two are a pair.

800
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:46,109
You've created quite a stir, Lexie.

801
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:49,192
I'm just getting started.

802
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:53,675
You know, you have many qualities that
I like, not the least of which is intelligence.

803
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:57,438
If you write that story, I'll have your job.

804
01:00:57,760 --> 01:00:59,079
You wouldn't be very good at it.

805
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:01,833
- You're quick, too.
- And I got great legs.

806
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:03,512
First thing I noticed.

807
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:08,991
The story runs tomorrow.

808
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:15,512
See you tomorrow, Lexie.

809
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:28,316
- Let's get this over with.
- Yeah.

810
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:33,754
Outside.

811
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:53,351
Go ahead. Throw one.

812
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:55,670
No, you're the injured party.
You get the first punch.

813
01:01:59,360 --> 01:02:00,588
That's not bad.

814
01:02:02,040 --> 01:02:04,474
Now when I get up,
I'm going to punch you back.

815
01:02:04,560 --> 01:02:05,834
I just want to say,

816
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:08,073
stay away from my right knee.

817
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:10,794
Watch my left shoulder.

818
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:13,034
I will.

819
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:16,349
Also my right hindquarter.

820
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:19,432
Behind my right thigh, but really,
the whole hindquarter.

821
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:25,552
Well, you wouldn't punch me in the back,
would you? Because I got a bad back.

822
01:02:25,640 --> 01:02:26,755
No, never.

823
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:32,960
- Let's just go for the face.
- Me too, just hit me in the face.

824
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:46,552
Say, Harvey, I'm coming home.

825
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:47,629
<i>Did you get him?</i>

826
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:50,075
I got him, but you're not gonna like it.

827
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:54,314
It's going to read, "We wanted a war hero
so badly, we went out and got one."

828
01:02:54,560 --> 01:02:57,279
<i>You did your job.
Now, come on home and write it.</i>

829
01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:02,072
<i>You know something, Harvey?
Sometimes this job stinks.</i>

830
01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:05,837
<i>A lot of times, kid.
See you tomorrow.</i>

831
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:08,230
<i>Yeah, I'll see you tomorrow.</i>

832
01:03:27,040 --> 01:03:28,632
That ought to hold you.

833
01:03:31,560 --> 01:03:32,993
How's your hand?

834
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:35,990
I didn't mean to hurt it with my face.

835
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,513
I think I'll play for Chicago.

836
01:03:58,440 --> 01:04:00,032
I thought you should know.

837
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:04,873
Good team.

838
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:06,234
When you going?

839
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:09,594
Tomorrow.

840
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:15,273
We play Chicago Sunday.

841
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:17,755
I know.

842
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:23,190
Well, then we'll just have to beat you.

843
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:28,313
Not likely.

844
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:05,072
This ought to be good.

845
01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:06,434
Nice turnout.

846
01:06:15,040 --> 01:06:18,032
Gentlemen, thank you very much
for coming out this morning.

847
01:06:18,120 --> 01:06:21,192
<i>I will be brief. Two days ago, the Tribune</i>

848
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:25,432
made a salacious and quite outrageous
accusation that my client,

849
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:27,715
Carter Rutherford, a great war hero,

850
01:06:27,800 --> 01:06:30,519
was less than truthful about
his service to his country.

851
01:06:30,600 --> 01:06:32,591
They produced one witness.

852
01:06:32,680 --> 01:06:37,993
Anonymously. One man, who'd served
alongside Carter on the frontlines.

853
01:06:38,080 --> 01:06:40,594
The only other corroborating story
came from

854
01:06:40,680 --> 01:06:44,639
Miss Lexie Littleton,
who claimed that Carter confessed to her

855
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:47,553
that his war story was a lie.

856
01:06:47,640 --> 01:06:49,835
However, I have with me today

857
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:53,549
Mr Mack Steiner, a veteran of the Great War.

858
01:06:53,640 --> 01:06:55,710
Mr Steiner, please.

859
01:07:00,320 --> 01:07:03,915
Hello.
My name is Lieutenant Mack Steiner.

860
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,309
I am a veteran of the Great War.

861
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:09,915
I also served with Mr Rutherford in that war.

862
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:13,072
And I think what would be
of most interest to you

863
01:07:13,160 --> 01:07:17,631
<i>is that I am the source the Tribune
has quoted in its damning article.</i>

864
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:22,110
All I can tell you is that article,
written by Miss Littleton,

865
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:26,557
is filled with half-truths
and exaggerated facts.

866
01:07:28,320 --> 01:07:30,311
The whole truth

867
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:33,995
is that Mr Rutherford is a war hero.

868
01:07:34,080 --> 01:07:35,991
I was honoured to serve with him!

869
01:07:36,760 --> 01:07:40,275
So who got to you, Mack?
How much you getting paid?

870
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:41,515
Once again we...

871
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:43,989
How much are you getting paid, huh, Mack?

872
01:07:45,560 --> 01:07:48,552
<i>We demand that the Tribune
issue an apology</i>

873
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:51,359
and recant this story immediately!

874
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:53,398
Come back, Miss Littleton!

875
01:07:53,480 --> 01:07:55,357
Come back and face your critics!

876
01:07:57,400 --> 01:08:00,676
Ladies and gentlemen.
Ladies and gentlemen!

877
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:05,708
Good morning, folks.
My name is Pete Harpen.

878
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:08,394
I was a prosecutor
for the State of Wisconsin

879
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:10,311
until 10:00 a.m. this morning.

880
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:14,871
At that time, Congress appointed me
the Commissioner of Professional Football.

881
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,753
This new job will start immediately,
and my first charge

882
01:08:17,840 --> 01:08:21,435
will be to get to the bottom of this scandal,
and then move on.

883
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:26,833
That means rules adhered to,
codes of ethics, owners, players.

884
01:08:26,920 --> 01:08:31,630
Everything pertaining to football
will now have me to answer to.

885
01:08:31,720 --> 01:08:35,872
<i>And that means right now
the Chicago Tribune has me to answer to.</i>

886
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:39,475
So, fellas,
I think this press conference is concluded.

887
01:08:43,720 --> 01:08:45,199
It doesn't matter. You're writing a retraction.

888
01:08:45,280 --> 01:08:48,192
- But I didn't make it up. The story's true.
- That part doesn't matter.

889
01:08:48,280 --> 01:08:50,077
There must have been nine or ten
other soldiers there.

890
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:51,275
Give me a chance to round them up.

891
01:08:51,360 --> 01:08:54,318
Mickey already found five or six.
Private Mike Stone, Private Henry Maggio...

892
01:08:54,400 --> 01:08:56,436
- They all say none of them will talk.
- Little more time, Harvey.

893
01:08:56,520 --> 01:08:59,432
Well, I'll get somebody.
I'll find a couple of those krauts if I have to.

894
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:01,078
We don't have the time, God damn it.

895
01:09:01,160 --> 01:09:02,798
We're cutting our losses and getting out.

896
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:05,269
I'm not gonna write it. You can grab
one of these clowns if you want to,

897
01:09:05,360 --> 01:09:07,032
but I'm the one getting my wings clipped.

898
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:08,792
Sorry, Harvey.
Lexie, there's somebody here to see you.

899
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:10,711
- Who?
- Dodge Connelly.

900
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:14,392
Tell him I'm not here.

901
01:09:14,480 --> 01:09:15,833
I heard that!

902
01:09:17,760 --> 01:09:19,352
God damn it.

903
01:09:20,480 --> 01:09:23,836
You know, Dodge, you've got a knack
for showing up at the perfect time.

904
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:26,639
- Some call it a skill.
- Did you come to gloat?

905
01:09:26,720 --> 01:09:29,917
- I was just in the neighbourhood.
- Chicago. Just out for a stroll?

906
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:36,872
- Can I talk to you in private?
- Fine.

907
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,833
So, ready for the big game Sunday?
- Not really.

908
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:43,957
Queer, you saying that.
I've never known you to quit before a game.

909
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:45,672
Well, we got ourselves
a new football commissioner.

910
01:09:45,760 --> 01:09:46,875
He doesn't like the way we play the game.

911
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:48,791
I know your new appointee.

912
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:52,919
I've been called to the carpet. I got to go
in tomorrow and lay before the king.

913
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,560
- You get to keep your job?
- If I play by their rules.

914
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:59,389
So play by their rules. It's fourth down.
Punt, you'll get the ball back.

915
01:09:59,480 --> 01:10:00,799
- Punt?
- That's what I'd do.

916
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:01,995
You would, would you?

917
01:10:02,080 --> 01:10:03,638
You get him again next Sunday.

918
01:10:03,720 --> 01:10:06,518
You go find the rest of the soldiers,
and you get the real story.

919
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:09,672
We called them all.
None of them will go on the record.

920
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:13,594
So now what, Mr Newspaper Man?
Statue of Liberty play?

921
01:10:13,680 --> 01:10:17,195
- Quit.
- Quit? And do what, Dodge?

922
01:10:18,120 --> 01:10:20,793
- Get married.
- There's a fine idea.

923
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:23,348
Can't make it in the big tough man's world,
so get out.

924
01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:24,839
And who should I marry, Dodge?

925
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:27,309
- A farmer? Be a milkmaid?
- Nothing wrong with football players.

926
01:10:27,400 --> 01:10:29,118
Nothing wrong with them?
There's nothing right with them.

927
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:30,918
Grown men in tights and headgear.

928
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:32,479
Is that what you came down here for,
Dodge?

929
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:35,120
To sweep me away from all of this
dull newspaper stuff to get married?

930
01:10:35,200 --> 01:10:37,953
- As a matter of fact it was.
- Well, tomorrow I've got to...

931
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:41,874
It was?

932
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:46,789
Lexie, Carter Rutherford on the line for you.

933
01:10:50,680 --> 01:10:51,954
Lexie?

934
01:10:57,760 --> 01:10:59,512
Should I tell him you're busy?

935
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:08,474
You're busy.

936
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:22,711
Oh, nuts.

937
01:11:30,680 --> 01:11:32,033
This better be good.

938
01:11:34,720 --> 01:11:36,392
Sure is a mess.

939
01:11:37,480 --> 01:11:39,198
Gonna get worse.

940
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:40,554
<i>For somebody.</i>

941
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:42,232
Is that what you wanted to say?

942
01:11:45,320 --> 01:11:46,753
Probably not.

943
01:11:48,760 --> 01:11:50,637
I'll see you at the hearing, Carter.

944
01:11:50,720 --> 01:11:52,790
I'm sure you'll get everything you want.

945
01:11:54,160 --> 01:11:55,673
Probably not.

946
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:13,992
A shot of whisky, please.

947
01:12:19,960 --> 01:12:21,234
What do you think?

948
01:12:22,280 --> 01:12:23,554
About?

949
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:26,949
We got a shot at beating Chicago now?

950
01:12:27,640 --> 01:12:30,871
You kidding?
We had them beat when we pulled in.

951
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:32,075
Yup.

952
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:36,955
How about that Lexie?
Who'd have thought it?

953
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:39,153
Not me.

954
01:12:40,240 --> 01:12:41,992
I liked her, too.

955
01:12:42,080 --> 01:12:43,593
Stand ready, boys.

956
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:53,914
Say, Mac. Give me some beers
and a bottle of your second-finest bourbon.

957
01:12:57,760 --> 01:12:58,749
Thank you.

958
01:12:59,400 --> 01:13:02,233
A toast! A toast!

959
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:04,470
To the greatest football team in the world!

960
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:07,474
- Chicago!
- To Chicago!

961
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:11,192
To the Bulldogs!

962
01:13:12,360 --> 01:13:14,920
To the greatest game in the world!

963
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:23,198
Get the hell off me, shit for brains!

964
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:26,877
Put the boy down, asshole.

965
01:13:33,080 --> 01:13:34,433
We were just horsing around.

966
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:38,477
There's no need to call
people names, Grandpa.

967
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:54,789
Now, I appreciate that
you fellows are in uniform,

968
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:58,668
so I'm going to give you an opportunity
to extract yourself from this situation.

969
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:01,718
- To do what?
- Back off the throttle, kid.

970
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:05,110
I sure do hate to hit an old man.

971
01:14:31,680 --> 01:14:32,954
Sorry, Dodge.

972
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:38,232
Hey, Dodge!

973
01:14:39,800 --> 01:14:40,789
Eddie?

974
01:14:40,880 --> 01:14:43,155
Jesus, it's been years. You look great!

975
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:45,192
You do, too. You still in uniform?

976
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:46,872
I'm a sergeant now. No more taking orders.

977
01:14:47,120 --> 01:14:50,669
Hey, Frankie, this is Dodge Connelly.
We fought in France together.

978
01:14:50,760 --> 01:14:53,558
- You don't say. Nice to meet you.
- You, too.

979
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:54,829
Yeah.

980
01:14:55,280 --> 01:14:56,952
So, what are you doing in town?

981
01:14:57,040 --> 01:14:59,270
We're off to China in a week.
Thought we'd hit the town.

982
01:14:59,360 --> 01:15:00,588
This is the best spot.

983
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:05,469
<i>Over there, over there</i>

984
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:09,594
<i>Send the word, send the word over there</i>

985
01:15:09,960 --> 01:15:14,431
<i>That the Yanks are coming
The Yanks are coming</i>

986
01:15:14,520 --> 01:15:18,399
<i>The drums rum-tumming everywhere</i>

987
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:20,550
<i>So prepare</i>

988
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:22,312
When you shipping out?

989
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:25,517
Friday. We're gonna hit all the joints
and try to get in the game in the morning.

990
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:29,030
You know, Eddie, I play for the Bulldogs.

991
01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:31,429
I know, Dodge. Everybody knows.

992
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:33,909
They do? What do they say about me?

993
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,798
They like you, but the game's changing.

994
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:39,235
Yeah. For the better?

995
01:15:39,320 --> 01:15:43,871
Don't know. I do know we like the Bullet.
He plays for us now.

996
01:15:43,960 --> 01:15:47,157
Yeah. He's a hell of a player.

997
01:15:47,240 --> 01:15:49,390
<i>And a war hero, no thanks to the Tribune.</i>

998
01:15:49,480 --> 01:15:53,359
<i>We'll be over, we're coming over</i>

999
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:59,959
<i>And we won't come back till it's over
over there</i>

1000
01:16:00,240 --> 01:16:01,514
What time is it?

1001
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:03,753
6:00 a.m.

1002
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:07,871
Eddie, you want to get your boys
in the game this afternoon?

1003
01:16:07,960 --> 01:16:09,029
Do I?

1004
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:12,157
Can I borrow something from you fellas?
In exchange for front-row seats.

1005
01:16:13,160 --> 01:16:16,357
Depends. Just what do you want to borrow?

1006
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:20,076
<i>The drums rum-tumming everywhere</i>

1007
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:24,633
<i>So prepare, say a prayer</i>

1008
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:29,192
<i>Send the word, send the word to beware</i>

1009
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:34,754
<i>We'll be over, we're coming over</i>

1010
01:16:35,040 --> 01:16:41,354
<i>And we won't come back till it's over
over there</i>

1011
01:16:49,120 --> 01:16:51,350
Mr Harpen will see you now.

1012
01:16:53,320 --> 01:16:55,390
Funny how things work out.

1013
01:16:56,280 --> 01:16:58,032
New set of rules today.

1014
01:16:59,480 --> 01:17:01,710
Why was this woman put on the story?

1015
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:05,509
Harvey, I think that question is for you.

1016
01:17:06,600 --> 01:17:08,033
She's the best.

1017
01:17:08,120 --> 01:17:09,394
Is that right?

1018
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:11,832
Miss Littleton, are you the best?

1019
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:14,391
You want me to answer that?

1020
01:17:15,640 --> 01:17:16,993
We'll get back to you.

1021
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:21,197
Mr Rutherford, the story of your
accomplishments smells of legend.

1022
01:17:21,280 --> 01:17:23,919
Mr Commissioner,
the men who served with Carter back up...

1023
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:25,718
Back his story? That's fine.

1024
01:17:25,800 --> 01:17:28,553
There were many fine men
who served in this war.

1025
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:30,870
Let's say you just sit there, CC.

1026
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:33,433
I know you.

1027
01:17:37,480 --> 01:17:39,710
Harvey, I want that retraction in your paper.

1028
01:17:40,760 --> 01:17:42,352
Front page.

1029
01:17:43,280 --> 01:17:47,432
Miss Littleton, you're going to write it,
or I'll run you out of this town on a rail.

1030
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:49,158
- It's going to run tomorrow morning.
- I'll resign.

1031
01:17:49,240 --> 01:17:50,309
That's fine.

1032
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:52,470
Mickey Patterson from the Metro desk
can write it.

1033
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:56,269
And may I just add that although
you cannot un-tell a lie,

1034
01:17:56,360 --> 01:17:59,636
<i>I hope the Tribune will bend over backwards
to restore the reputation of my client.</i>

1035
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:02,598
We have many lucrative contracts...

1036
01:18:02,680 --> 01:18:04,272
I'm sorry, Mr Harpen. He just barged in!

1037
01:18:04,360 --> 01:18:05,839
It was important for me to be here,

1038
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:08,480
- since it's my player that's been traded.
- It's all right, Bonnie.

1039
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:10,835
Mr Connelly, the Chicago trade
is not one of the subjects...

1040
01:18:10,920 --> 01:18:12,148
Hey, Carter, how's tricks?

1041
01:18:12,240 --> 01:18:13,832
Don't you have a game today?
You look like hell.

1042
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:15,433
That's because I've been up
drinking all night.

1043
01:18:15,520 --> 01:18:16,555
Say, Lexie!

1044
01:18:16,640 --> 01:18:17,914
Say, Dodge.
What are you doing?

1045
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:19,433
Here's the skinny.

1046
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:21,511
So, I'm out all night at a joint called
The Green Room,

1047
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:22,635
where they serve liquor.

1048
01:18:22,720 --> 01:18:24,199
Which is illegal, last time I checked.

1049
01:18:24,280 --> 01:18:27,511
Right you are, Pete,
and a young cocktail waitress named Ya Ya

1050
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:31,673
said to send you her best,
which from what I hear, is miraculous.

1051
01:18:31,760 --> 01:18:34,354
Not key to this story. My point is, I was out

1052
01:18:34,440 --> 01:18:36,715
drinking and celebrating
with a bunch of Chicago fans

1053
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:39,360
who also happen to be veterans
of the Great War.

1054
01:18:39,440 --> 01:18:41,396
As what goes on at a place like this,
we get to talking,

1055
01:18:41,480 --> 01:18:44,074
and you come to find out that
six or seven of these fellas

1056
01:18:44,160 --> 01:18:46,913
served with Carter
when he beat the Kaiser single-handedly.

1057
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:51,755
Well, Mr Connelly, we've established
that Mr Rutherford's war record is intact.

1058
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:53,239
Right you are, Pete.

1059
01:18:53,320 --> 01:18:55,754
So I tell these guys
that I'm playing with Carter later on today,

1060
01:18:55,840 --> 01:18:59,435
and they tell me that they really
want to see their buddy face to face.

1061
01:19:01,040 --> 01:19:02,712
To thank him, I would suppose.

1062
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:05,268
I can't think of any other reason.
Can you, Carter?

1063
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:09,791
So here's the fun part. I say to myself,

1064
01:19:09,880 --> 01:19:11,598
I say, "Dodge, what the hell!

1065
01:19:11,680 --> 01:19:14,956
"Carter's just down at the courthouse.
These fellows can see him right now!"

1066
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:18,191
They flipped. They jumped into the back
of the truck. They're down here right now,

1067
01:19:18,280 --> 01:19:21,113
in the pouring rain,
waiting to see their buddy.

1068
01:19:21,200 --> 01:19:22,952
Carter, they really wanted to see you.

1069
01:19:23,040 --> 01:19:25,395
There's this one fellow,
I don't remember his name.

1070
01:19:25,480 --> 01:19:28,313
Little guy, he's got dark hair, he's...

1071
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:29,674
Private Maggio?

1072
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:31,273
Maggio, yeah. He's a lieutenant now.

1073
01:19:31,360 --> 01:19:34,432
And then another guy,
big, stocky fellow with a crew cut.

1074
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:36,317
He's bulky, kind of heavy-set.

1075
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:37,992
- Stone?
- Mike Stone?

1076
01:19:38,080 --> 01:19:40,150
Mike Stone! Mike Stone.
Yeah, he's put on a lot of weight.

1077
01:19:40,240 --> 01:19:43,073
Pete, come on, let's do a little something
nice for our boys in the uniform.

1078
01:19:43,160 --> 01:19:46,470
Well, let's make it quick. Bonnie,
send those soldiers up, if you would.

1079
01:19:46,560 --> 01:19:49,916
Hey, boys! Come on up here!
He's dying to see you!

1080
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:53,671
- What did he say?
- He wants us to go up.

1081
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:55,193
Come on, we got to go.

1082
01:19:57,600 --> 01:19:59,192
Let's go down and meet them.
They don't have to walk up.

1083
01:19:59,280 --> 01:20:01,077
CC, I'd like to thank
those fellows for their service.

1084
01:20:01,160 --> 01:20:04,197
They shouldn't come in here.
It would be a mistake for them to come here.

1085
01:20:04,280 --> 01:20:05,633
What are you talking about,
mistake?

1086
01:20:05,720 --> 01:20:06,755
Because these soldiers,

1087
01:20:06,840 --> 01:20:08,478
they've been up all night at a speakeasy
with some gal named Ya Ya.

1088
01:20:08,560 --> 01:20:10,596
What do you say we just stop?

1089
01:20:10,680 --> 01:20:13,069
- No...
- CC, stop.

1090
01:20:22,960 --> 01:20:26,157
It's my fault. I should have put an end to it.

1091
01:20:26,840 --> 01:20:28,432
Put an end to what?

1092
01:20:34,680 --> 01:20:35,954
It's all true.

1093
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:38,311
Lexie's story.

1094
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:40,516
And the soldiers down in that truck,
they know it.

1095
01:20:42,080 --> 01:20:44,958
That's why CC doesn't want these fellows
to come up here.

1096
01:20:48,160 --> 01:20:50,230
What about Mack Steiner's story?

1097
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:55,750
I guess CC paid him off.

1098
01:21:04,320 --> 01:21:06,072
Sit down, all of you.

1099
01:21:15,560 --> 01:21:17,312
It's funny how things work out.

1100
01:21:19,680 --> 01:21:21,671
Lexie, you and Harvey can go.

1101
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:24,391
You're not going to write a retraction.

1102
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:27,517
I thought you'd see it our way,
Commissioner. I'll get my hat.

1103
01:21:31,160 --> 01:21:32,149
Lexie.

1104
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:36,314
Thanks, fellas.

1105
01:21:40,760 --> 01:21:42,034
See you, Lex.

1106
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:45,030
Be seeing you, Dodge.

1107
01:21:52,040 --> 01:21:54,156
I'll be with you in a second, Mr Connelly.

1108
01:21:58,400 --> 01:22:01,915
Mr Rutherford, you got one play here.

1109
01:22:02,400 --> 01:22:03,879
You go to the press and tell them

1110
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:07,748
you were part of a great group of boys
who fought for their country,

1111
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:09,751
and you got too much credit.

1112
01:22:12,640 --> 01:22:14,312
You think that will settle it?

1113
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:19,833
That, and you're gonna donate 50%
of your earnings to the American Legion.

1114
01:22:20,520 --> 01:22:23,398
- Is that before or after commissions?
- Before.

1115
01:22:24,160 --> 01:22:26,549
But that's not gonna matter
a whole hell of a lot.

1116
01:22:29,360 --> 01:22:31,590
Got a new book of rules.

1117
01:22:33,680 --> 01:22:38,993
"All agents and representatives of players
will be licensed by the state."

1118
01:22:39,080 --> 01:22:40,877
I'm the state.

1119
01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:43,758
I'm the one who approves your licence, CC.

1120
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:45,353
You're out of football.

1121
01:22:46,760 --> 01:22:48,398
I'll fight you in court.

1122
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:50,630
You get your lawyer, I'll get mine.

1123
01:22:57,120 --> 01:22:58,633
Good day, gentlemen.

1124
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:23,520
It is funny how things work out.

1125
01:23:24,080 --> 01:23:25,638
Do you know Chicago bookmakers

1126
01:23:25,720 --> 01:23:29,633
are betting on the game of professional
football not lasting a year?

1127
01:23:29,720 --> 01:23:31,472
Even with Carter.

1128
01:23:32,080 --> 01:23:35,197
And then where will all the little boys
who won't grow up go?

1129
01:23:39,680 --> 01:23:41,272
There's always baseball.

1130
01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:50,356
How much longer you think
you might be playing?

1131
01:23:50,440 --> 01:23:51,589
Why?

1132
01:23:54,200 --> 01:23:56,873
The game of professional football
has come of age.

1133
01:23:56,960 --> 01:24:00,157
Now we got to abide by
a uniform set of rules.

1134
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:03,678
It's too much, too much money now.

1135
01:24:04,880 --> 01:24:08,077
No more hiding footballs under your jersey.

1136
01:24:08,160 --> 01:24:11,994
No more Pig in the Poke.
No more Crusty Bobs.

1137
01:24:13,200 --> 01:24:17,512
No more all-nights in a speakeasy
with my friend Ya Ya.

1138
01:24:18,840 --> 01:24:20,990
It's time for you to retire, Dodge.

1139
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:25,272
But you can't make me.

1140
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:27,674
No.

1141
01:24:28,720 --> 01:24:31,757
But I can fine the hell out of you
till you're broke.

1142
01:24:32,960 --> 01:24:36,475
And if you pull a stunt today,
I'll kick you out.

1143
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:39,030
- You got that much gas?
- Try me.

1144
01:24:43,440 --> 01:24:45,158
Have a good game today, Dodge.

1145
01:24:46,240 --> 01:24:47,992
Have a good, clean game.

1146
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:00,475
Thanks, fellas.

1147
01:25:00,560 --> 01:25:02,949
- It doesn't seem fair.
- We never played any game clean.

1148
01:25:03,040 --> 01:25:05,998
- We played Wabash clean last year.
- They only had nine men.

1149
01:25:06,080 --> 01:25:07,672
Yeah, but still...

1150
01:25:16,400 --> 01:25:19,119
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
good afternoon and welcome.</i>

1151
01:25:19,200 --> 01:25:23,034
<i>It is a fine day for professional football
here in Chicago.</i>

1152
01:25:23,120 --> 01:25:26,954
<i>Rain has been coming down in buckets
but, at least for the moment, has subsided.</i>

1153
01:25:27,040 --> 01:25:28,792
<i>That's making for some muddy conditions</i>

1154
01:25:28,880 --> 01:25:31,917
<i>as the league-leading Chicago team,
with their new star</i>

1155
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:33,513
<i>Carter "the Bullet" Rutherford,</i>

1156
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:36,910
<i>hosts the Duluth Bulldogs,
who are out for revenge.</i>

1157
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:38,718
<i>Field conditions are simply horrible.</i>

1158
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:41,268
<i>That should favour
the ground game of Chicago.</i>

1159
01:25:41,360 --> 01:25:43,078
<i>But the real story today is the match-up</i>

1160
01:25:43,160 --> 01:25:45,958
<i>between the Bullet
and old team-mate Dodge Connelly.</i>

1161
01:25:46,040 --> 01:25:48,998
<i>And we're proud to bring you
all the action live on the radio.</i>

1162
01:25:49,080 --> 01:25:52,550
Joining me in the broadcast booth
is Saul Keller, our sound engineer.

1163
01:25:52,640 --> 01:25:55,473
And we remind you that our programme
is brought to you in part by

1164
01:25:55,560 --> 01:25:57,835
Coca-Cola, "Delicious and refreshing,"

1165
01:25:57,920 --> 01:26:00,480
and Standard Motor Gasoline.

1166
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:18,550
Go home, you bums!

1167
01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:26,957
I hope Big Gus didn't stretch
your uniform out too bad, Eddie.

1168
01:26:27,040 --> 01:26:28,314
Lose this one for us, will you, Dodge?

1169
01:26:29,360 --> 01:26:30,793
We just might.

1170
01:27:09,840 --> 01:27:11,956
Never thought I'd see the day.

1171
01:27:12,040 --> 01:27:13,314
Times are changing.

1172
01:27:13,440 --> 01:27:15,078
It's a hell of a thing.

1173
01:27:15,160 --> 01:27:16,912
You can't say "hell" over the radio.

1174
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:18,795
Why not?

1175
01:27:18,880 --> 01:27:20,552
Those are the rules.

1176
01:27:20,640 --> 01:27:21,755
Jesus.

1177
01:27:21,840 --> 01:27:23,831
You can't say "Jesus," either!

1178
01:27:33,200 --> 01:27:35,509
- Say, Sudsey.
- Hiya, doll.

1179
01:27:37,040 --> 01:27:38,439
Hell of a crowd.

1180
01:27:38,520 --> 01:27:40,033
Are you two related?

1181
01:27:43,200 --> 01:27:45,350
<i>Well,
we are ready for the coin toss.</i>

1182
01:27:45,440 --> 01:27:49,353
<i>The two captains, Connelly and Rutherford,
are going to head to the 50-yard line.</i>

1183
01:27:49,440 --> 01:27:53,274
<i>And who wouldn't want to be down there
on the field for this exchange?</i>

1184
01:27:59,800 --> 01:28:01,233
Dodge.

1185
01:28:01,320 --> 01:28:02,753
- Fellas.
- Carter.

1186
01:28:02,840 --> 01:28:05,638
Okay, so, the winner of the coin toss

1187
01:28:05,720 --> 01:28:07,950
gets to determine which side of the field
they want to play on.

1188
01:28:08,040 --> 01:28:11,555
For example, Dodge,
if you want to play from this end zone...

1189
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:15,991
Jimmy, what happens after that?

1190
01:28:17,320 --> 01:28:18,992
It's a new rule.

1191
01:28:25,080 --> 01:28:29,039
Oh, yeah. Okay. Then the opposing team,
that would be you, Carter,

1192
01:28:29,120 --> 01:28:31,031
you decide whether you want to kick off
or receive.

1193
01:28:31,120 --> 01:28:33,714
And that's all determined by the coin toss.

1194
01:28:33,800 --> 01:28:34,994
Who calls that?

1195
01:28:38,880 --> 01:28:40,472
Hell, I don't care.

1196
01:28:40,560 --> 01:28:43,916
Carter, you call it. You're the home team.

1197
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:45,911
Write that down. That's a good one.

1198
01:28:46,600 --> 01:28:47,715
Heads.

1199
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:55,115
It's heads.

1200
01:28:55,200 --> 01:28:56,235
We'll take the ball.

1201
01:28:58,920 --> 01:28:59,989
We'll take that side of the field.

1202
01:29:00,080 --> 01:29:02,913
Okay, well,
then let's get this damn thing started!

1203
01:29:05,560 --> 01:29:07,232
It's a whole new game.

1204
01:29:07,880 --> 01:29:10,519
- I'll try not to hurt you.
- Yeah, you do that.

1205
01:29:15,160 --> 01:29:18,994
<i>And here we go, folks.
Duluth is set to kick off to Chicago.</i>

1206
01:29:19,080 --> 01:29:21,435
<i>Hardleg Hansen boots the ball in the air.</i>

1207
01:29:21,520 --> 01:29:23,238
<i>And Rutherford snags it.</i>

1208
01:29:23,320 --> 01:29:26,551
<i>He's to the 10, the 20.
Look out, he's at the 30!</i>

1209
01:29:26,640 --> 01:29:28,835
<i>Side-stepped Ralph Banning.
Look at him go!</i>

1210
01:29:28,920 --> 01:29:31,718
<i>He's at the 40, the 50!
He's got one guy to beat.</i>

1211
01:29:31,800 --> 01:29:34,473
<i>Yes, folks, it's number 7, Dodge Connelly!</i>

1212
01:29:34,560 --> 01:29:37,916
<i>Connelly brings down Rutherford
at the Bulldogs' 49-yard line.</i>

1213
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:41,709
<i>Chicago fans are on their feet.
Now, that's how you start a game!</i>

1214
01:29:41,800 --> 01:29:42,915
<i>Wow!</i>

1215
01:29:46,440 --> 01:29:49,637
18, 24, hike!

1216
01:29:50,760 --> 01:29:53,957
<i>The ball is handed
off to Rutherford at the line of scrimmage,</i>

1217
01:29:54,040 --> 01:29:58,352
<i>and he's slammed to the ground by
Big Gus Schiller from Penrose High School.</i>

1218
01:30:01,400 --> 01:30:02,674
It's a run.

1219
01:30:11,240 --> 01:30:13,470
<i>Well,
after three very safe plays,</i>

1220
01:30:13,560 --> 01:30:15,869
<i>Chicago is finding itself facing a fourth down</i>

1221
01:30:15,960 --> 01:30:17,473
<i>with 8 yards to go.</i>

1222
01:30:17,560 --> 01:30:21,075
<i>They'll line up for a field goal and hope
to walk away with just three points here.</i>

1223
01:30:21,400 --> 01:30:24,198
<i>That is some well-played defence
by the Bulldogs.</i>

1224
01:30:25,400 --> 01:30:27,834
It's all right, fellas.
We're just going to wear them down.

1225
01:30:27,920 --> 01:30:31,435
Let's take three and put them
back on their heels, all right? Let's go.

1226
01:30:32,520 --> 01:30:37,310
<i>Hauser is lined up for the kick.
The snap is down and the kick is...</i>

1227
01:30:38,440 --> 01:30:40,192
<i>Good!</i>

1228
01:30:40,280 --> 01:30:41,918
<i>It only took six minutes into the first quarter</i>

1229
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:43,956
<i>to get on the board,
and Chicago has done it.</i>

1230
01:30:44,040 --> 01:30:45,359
<i>They lead, 3 to nil.</i>

1231
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:47,874
Legs Hauser is set to kick off for Chicago.

1232
01:30:47,960 --> 01:30:50,076
Sudsey, can I have
a shot of your giggle water?

1233
01:30:50,160 --> 01:30:52,958
Yeah, but don't drink it all. I'm in need.

1234
01:30:54,520 --> 01:30:58,832
Word is the new commissioner told Dodge
he had to play the game clean

1235
01:30:58,920 --> 01:31:00,831
or he'd kick him out of football.

1236
01:31:00,920 --> 01:31:02,399
Clean?

1237
01:31:02,480 --> 01:31:05,552
No Pig in a Poke? No Chasing the Cattail?

1238
01:31:05,640 --> 01:31:07,392
Not even a Crusty Bob.

1239
01:31:09,160 --> 01:31:10,593
Christ!

1240
01:31:12,480 --> 01:31:13,754
Sorry.

1241
01:31:14,600 --> 01:31:16,511
Can he win like that?

1242
01:31:16,600 --> 01:31:18,670
Without question, he cannot.

1243
01:31:18,960 --> 01:31:21,633
But the worst part is...

1244
01:31:21,720 --> 01:31:22,789
Boring.

1245
01:31:23,320 --> 01:31:25,515
<i>Well, with 10
minutes left to go in the second quarter,</i>

1246
01:31:25,600 --> 01:31:30,116
<i>Chicago still leads, 3 to nothing.
Neither team seems to be moving the ball.</i>

1247
01:31:30,200 --> 01:31:33,795
<i>The Bulldogs with just 48 yards
of total offence.</i>

1248
01:31:38,200 --> 01:31:40,316
All right, how many yards did we get,
seven?

1249
01:31:40,400 --> 01:31:41,389
Two.

1250
01:31:41,480 --> 01:31:43,391
- Really?
- One-and-a-half.

1251
01:31:43,480 --> 01:31:46,153
- What down is it, second?
- Third. Third.

1252
01:31:46,240 --> 01:31:48,390
- All right, let's throw the ball down the field.
- Okay.

1253
01:31:48,480 --> 01:31:51,392
Curly, you run down the sideline,
and you beat that dwarf to the 40, okay?

1254
01:31:51,480 --> 01:31:52,515
- Okay, Dodge.
- All right.

1255
01:31:58,240 --> 01:32:01,437
<i>Well, the first half has
ended pretty much the way we started here,</i>

1256
01:32:01,520 --> 01:32:03,317
<i>3 to nil, Chicago.</i>

1257
01:32:03,400 --> 01:32:04,879
<i>And after two quarters of play,</i>

1258
01:32:04,960 --> 01:32:08,111
<i>I guess you could blame
the low-scoring game on field conditions.</i>

1259
01:32:08,200 --> 01:32:09,679
That's all right, Ralphie.

1260
01:32:09,760 --> 01:32:11,239
We can win this.

1261
01:32:11,320 --> 01:32:14,630
They just want to wear us down,
but we can win this!

1262
01:32:14,720 --> 01:32:16,790
Come on. Tell them, Dodge.

1263
01:32:17,720 --> 01:32:19,995
- We can win this.
- Yeah!

1264
01:32:20,080 --> 01:32:22,958
Yeah, Bulldogs! Come on, guys.

1265
01:32:24,160 --> 01:32:26,151
Put it down with the Bulldogs. Come on.

1266
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:28,117
<i>Gone are the big plays.</i>

1267
01:32:28,200 --> 01:32:31,237
<i>Gone are the on-field antics
that have made this Duluth team</i>

1268
01:32:31,320 --> 01:32:33,231
<i>so successful up to now.</i>

1269
01:32:33,360 --> 01:32:36,909
<i>So far, the big match-up between
Dodge Connelly and Carter Rutherford</i>

1270
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:39,719
<i>seems to be little more
than a wrestling match in the mud.</i>

1271
01:32:40,280 --> 01:32:44,876
57, 20 and hike!

1272
01:32:52,520 --> 01:32:54,351
<i>It looks
like Lake Michigan out there</i>

1273
01:32:54,440 --> 01:32:56,476
<i>and certainly seems to
be affecting both teams.</i>

1274
01:33:04,640 --> 01:33:05,914
Go on in.

1275
01:33:12,600 --> 01:33:14,192
What? I've never heard of that!

1276
01:33:14,280 --> 01:33:15,474
You can't block a man in the back!

1277
01:33:15,560 --> 01:33:18,518
You got to be kidding me!
Not even at his knees?

1278
01:33:20,200 --> 01:33:23,670
Pall Mall for that smooth, go anywhere taste.

1279
01:33:31,480 --> 01:33:33,311
<i>And as
we head into the fourth quarter here,</i>

1280
01:33:33,400 --> 01:33:37,473
<i>the scoreboard still reads
Chicago 3, Duluth 0.</i>

1281
01:33:37,560 --> 01:33:41,269
Today's match-up not exactly
the offensive showdown we'd hoped for.

1282
01:33:41,360 --> 01:33:43,669
More like a muddy snooze fest so far

1283
01:33:43,760 --> 01:33:46,274
as Carter "the Bullet" Rutherford has
a grand total of about 300 yards...

1284
01:33:46,360 --> 01:33:47,952
I can't tell who's who.

1285
01:33:48,040 --> 01:33:50,838
<i>Well, folks, with just
under a minute left in the fourth quarter,</i>

1286
01:33:50,920 --> 01:33:53,673
<i>Duluth is pinned down on their own 35.</i>

1287
01:33:53,760 --> 01:33:55,352
<i>It's fourth down at four yards to go.</i>

1288
01:33:55,440 --> 01:33:58,079
<i>The Bulldogs really have no choice
but to go for it.</i>

1289
01:34:01,240 --> 01:34:04,437
<i>Connelly takes a lateral from Zoom,
and look out, he's at the 45!</i>

1290
01:34:04,520 --> 01:34:07,318
<i>The 50! Rutherford tailing him!
He's at the 45!</i>

1291
01:34:07,400 --> 01:34:09,960
<i>Rutherford hot on his heels!
He brings down Connelly</i>

1292
01:34:10,360 --> 01:34:13,033
<i>on the 38-yard line of Chicago!
How about that?</i>

1293
01:34:14,200 --> 01:34:17,397
<i>Time-out on the field now,
and these fans are not happy.</i>

1294
01:34:17,480 --> 01:34:20,119
<i>And they're letting Rutherford
and his boys know.</i>

1295
01:34:22,200 --> 01:34:25,317
- How many time-outs we got left?
- Two.

1296
01:34:25,400 --> 01:34:27,675
Two? Good. We got time for two more plays.

1297
01:34:27,760 --> 01:34:28,829
We're gonna take it down the right side,

1298
01:34:28,920 --> 01:34:30,990
we're gonna get it out of bounds
and stop the clock.

1299
01:34:31,080 --> 01:34:34,038
Get about 8 more yards,
then Hardleg can tie this thing up.

1300
01:34:38,680 --> 01:34:39,954
What?

1301
01:34:41,080 --> 01:34:43,230
Let's just beat them now, Dodge.

1302
01:35:21,880 --> 01:35:23,632
You guys having fun?

1303
01:35:26,200 --> 01:35:27,474
Heck, yeah.

1304
01:35:31,880 --> 01:35:35,316
Okay, God damn it. Let's beat them now.

1305
01:35:35,400 --> 01:35:38,517
I got a new play.
It's called the Sergeant York.

1306
01:35:54,280 --> 01:35:56,589
Listen up, watch
the wing. Nobody gets out of bounds.

1307
01:35:58,560 --> 01:36:01,438
15, 33, hike!

1308
01:36:03,160 --> 01:36:05,628
<i>Bulldogs run
a sweep to the right side of the field,</i>

1309
01:36:05,720 --> 01:36:07,915
<i>and that's not fooling anyone.</i>

1310
01:36:24,040 --> 01:36:25,234
- Stretcher!
- Stretcher!

1311
01:36:25,320 --> 01:36:27,629
<i>And there
seems to be an injury on the field.</i>

1312
01:36:27,720 --> 01:36:30,109
A Duluth player,
can't quite make out which one.

1313
01:36:30,200 --> 01:36:32,430
They're gonna bring
the stretcher out to pick him up,

1314
01:36:32,520 --> 01:36:34,829
<i>but, boy, you hate to see that,
especially so late in the game.</i>

1315
01:36:34,920 --> 01:36:36,831
<i>Just 15 seconds left to go here.</i>

1316
01:36:36,920 --> 01:36:40,469
<i>That's bad luck for Coach Ferguson, too.
He's down to just 10 players.</i>

1317
01:36:40,560 --> 01:36:41,879
You need another player.

1318
01:36:42,280 --> 01:36:44,794
Well, that's all we got. We'll go with 10.

1319
01:36:44,880 --> 01:36:47,633
<i>And that's
going to cost him one of his time-outs.</i>

1320
01:36:47,720 --> 01:36:49,950
See if you can see which player that is.

1321
01:36:51,240 --> 01:36:52,673
Where's Dodge?

1322
01:36:52,760 --> 01:36:55,593
No time on the clock!
Watch that line. Nobody gets out of bounds!

1323
01:36:55,680 --> 01:36:57,830
Watch that line. Nobody gets out of bounds!

1324
01:37:01,640 --> 01:37:02,789
Nine!

1325
01:37:04,400 --> 01:37:05,435
Twenty-one!

1326
01:37:07,160 --> 01:37:09,879
Here we go! No time left! This is it, boys!

1327
01:37:16,200 --> 01:37:18,998
<i>Zoom takes
the snap. And here comes Chicago.</i>

1328
01:37:19,080 --> 01:37:21,594
<i>He looks down the field. He's still looking.</i>

1329
01:37:21,680 --> 01:37:23,557
<i>All the receivers are well covered.</i>

1330
01:37:23,640 --> 01:37:26,359
<i>Zoom slides left,
almost gets tackled by his own player!</i>

1331
01:37:26,800 --> 01:37:30,475
<i>Rutherford has him in his sights!
There's the gun! No time left!</i>

1332
01:37:32,680 --> 01:37:34,671
<i>Zoom throws up a Hail Mary!</i>

1333
01:37:34,760 --> 01:37:36,478
<i>The ball's in the air.</i>

1334
01:37:37,240 --> 01:37:38,275
<i>And...</i>

1335
01:37:41,560 --> 01:37:45,030
<i>It popped right out of the hands
of Bakes Davis!</i>

1336
01:37:45,120 --> 01:37:49,398
<i>I can't tell. The ball is somewhere down
in a pile of some four or five players.</i>

1337
01:37:50,160 --> 01:37:52,833
<i>The referee is pulling them apart, and...</i>

1338
01:37:54,360 --> 01:37:55,839
<i>It's...</i>

1339
01:37:57,560 --> 01:38:00,120
<i>It's intercepted! It's intercepted!</i>

1340
01:38:00,440 --> 01:38:04,558
<i>Chicago wins!
My, oh my, oh my, what a finish!</i>

1341
01:38:04,640 --> 01:38:09,270
<i>Chicago has intercepted and blanked the
Bulldogs today, and this crowd is loving it!</i>

1342
01:38:09,480 --> 01:38:10,469
Yeah!

1343
01:38:28,440 --> 01:38:30,635
- Where's Dodge?
- What?

1344
01:38:36,200 --> 01:38:40,034
<i>Wait a minute. There
seems to be some confusion on the field.</i>

1345
01:38:42,080 --> 01:38:44,310
<i>Ich gebe auf!</i>

1346
01:38:45,480 --> 01:38:47,311
<i>Ich gebe auf!</i>

1347
01:38:48,720 --> 01:38:50,472
<i>Ich gebe auf!</i>

1348
01:38:54,520 --> 01:38:58,354
<i>It's a touchdown,
not an interception! A touchdown!</i>

1349
01:38:58,600 --> 01:39:01,478
<i>Dodge Connelly has caught the ball
in the end zone with no time left!</i>

1350
01:39:01,560 --> 01:39:04,757
<i>Duluth has stunned this crowd!
The Bulldogs won!</i>

1351
01:39:04,840 --> 01:39:06,558
They won! They won!

1352
01:39:06,640 --> 01:39:08,995
The Bulldogs have beat Chicago, 6 to 3.

1353
01:39:09,080 --> 01:39:12,436
It's a Bulldog victory! Fantastic finish!

1354
01:39:21,600 --> 01:39:25,115
Dodge caught the ball!
Dodge caught the ball!

1355
01:39:33,240 --> 01:39:34,593
Shit.

1356
01:39:55,160 --> 01:39:57,594
They're going to kick you out
for that one, Dodge.

1357
01:39:58,040 --> 01:39:59,473
Yes, they will.

1358
01:40:00,760 --> 01:40:01,795
It was fun.

1359
01:40:08,760 --> 01:40:10,034
Take care, Carter.

1360
01:40:11,560 --> 01:40:12,675
Dodge.

1361
01:40:17,720 --> 01:40:19,870
I'm going to confess everything tomorrow.

1362
01:40:21,160 --> 01:40:22,832
The whole story.

1363
01:40:31,320 --> 01:40:32,309
Yeah.

1364
01:40:35,520 --> 01:40:39,911
I was with Sergeant York that day that
he took out 30 Germans single-handedly.

1365
01:40:40,720 --> 01:40:43,280
He got a lot of them. I got a few myself.

1366
01:40:45,080 --> 01:40:47,469
We like our heroes, Carter.

1367
01:40:50,680 --> 01:40:52,591
- You just made that up.
- Yes, I did.

1368
01:41:02,440 --> 01:41:03,475
Be seeing you.

1369
01:41:36,680 --> 01:41:38,989
So, I'm working on my lead story
for tomorrow.

1370
01:41:40,320 --> 01:41:41,594
Headline's something about

1371
01:41:41,680 --> 01:41:44,638
a single man taking on
an entire team by himself.

1372
01:41:44,720 --> 01:41:47,393
Well, there were other players on my team.

1373
01:41:47,480 --> 01:41:49,232
I was talking about Carter.

1374
01:41:50,040 --> 01:41:51,632
So you're a sportswriter now.

1375
01:41:52,280 --> 01:41:53,599
Why not?

1376
01:41:53,680 --> 01:41:55,671
Well, certain jobs are always
going to be done by men.

1377
01:41:56,320 --> 01:41:59,198
Big, strapping men? What else?

1378
01:41:59,640 --> 01:42:01,870
Auto mechanics, plumbers...

1379
01:42:02,360 --> 01:42:03,952
Motorcycles?

1380
01:42:04,600 --> 01:42:06,113
You want to drive?

1381
01:42:06,840 --> 01:42:09,718
Hop on, Mr Connelly.
I'll buy you a soda pop.

1382
01:42:30,720 --> 01:42:32,551
Worried about your reputation?

1383
01:42:36,320 --> 01:42:38,072
As a matter of fact, I am.

1384
01:42:52,120 --> 01:42:54,350
The trick is to hang on.

1385
01:43:00,040 --> 01:43:03,112
<i>What will become of us, Dodge?</i>

1386
01:43:03,200 --> 01:43:06,715
<i>Ride off into the sunset?
Live happily ever after?</i>

1387
01:43:07,160 --> 01:43:09,230
- Well, marriage.
- Of course.

1388
01:43:09,320 --> 01:43:12,039
- Kids, I suppose.
- Naturally.

1389
01:43:12,440 --> 01:43:14,510
I guess some sort of scandal.

1390
01:43:15,800 --> 01:43:18,109
- Taxes, maybe.
- Lose all our money.

1391
01:43:18,200 --> 01:43:19,758
The family home?

1392
01:43:19,840 --> 01:43:21,432
Then, after a brief turn in jail...

1393
01:43:21,800 --> 01:43:23,233
You'll like it there!

1394
01:43:23,320 --> 01:43:24,753
Not me, you.

1395
01:43:26,280 --> 01:43:28,271
Quickly followed by dementia.

1396
01:43:28,360 --> 01:43:29,713
What was your name, again?

1397
01:43:30,120 --> 01:43:32,429
- My friends call me Lexie.
- Fine.

1398
01:43:32,520 --> 01:43:34,750
You can call me Miss Littleton.

1399
01:43:35,160 --> 01:43:38,038
That'd be nice. Well, Miss Littleton...

1400
01:43:38,520 --> 01:43:43,007
You should be warned that the way
you're holding me now, you're choking me.
