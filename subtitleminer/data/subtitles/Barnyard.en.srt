1
00:01:33,193 --> 00:01:35,058
All right, now.

2
00:01:35,161 --> 00:01:38,324
I'm just heading to the fields, Duke.
I'll be back.

3
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:07,923
Clear!

4
00:02:11,197 --> 00:02:12,494
Hey, Jerry, how's your mama?

5
00:02:16,002 --> 00:02:20,132
Oh, yeah, it's a beautiful day.
Well, time to go to work.

6
00:02:25,545 --> 00:02:26,978
Morning, Ben.

7
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:31,817
Thanks, Miles.

8
00:02:32,418 --> 00:02:34,079
Let me know if you see Otis.

9
00:02:34,187 --> 00:02:36,280
I'm staying out of that one.

10
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:39,656
- Okay, meeting's in five minutes.
- Okay, boss.

11
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:41,954
And I want everyone present.

12
00:02:42,862 --> 00:02:44,420
Duke, have you seen Otis?

13
00:02:44,531 --> 00:02:46,226
Nope, I haven't seen him.

14
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:49,060
Now where was I? Oh, oh, yeah.

15
00:02:52,972 --> 00:02:54,837
The Jersey cows.

16
00:02:57,043 --> 00:02:59,511
- Hey, Benny boy.
- Hi.

17
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:02,641
Hey, you seen Otis around?

18
00:03:02,749 --> 00:03:05,240
Yes, I know exactly where Otis is.

19
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:08,479
You boys just steer clear
of Otis, all right?

20
00:03:09,088 --> 00:03:10,749
Anything you say there, Ben.

21
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:12,222
We'll take a rain check
on the meeting, though.

22
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:15,260
- Yeah, rain check.
- Yeah, that. Check.

23
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:16,328
Hey.

24
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:21,898
Hey, I stepped in something.
What's on my hoof?

25
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:24,127
Etta?

26
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:28,340
- Otis?
- Oh, Ben, don't worry.

27
00:03:28,441 --> 00:03:31,069
I'm sure he's heading
for the meeting right now.

28
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:36,276
Okay, let go. Let go. I got it.

29
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:37,974
- He said, "Let go."
- All right. He's okay.

30
00:03:38,084 --> 00:03:40,882
All right, boys, here's the dealio.

31
00:03:40,987 --> 00:03:45,151
It's a little creation of mine
I like to call "hill surfing."

32
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:47,589
- Watch your hoof.
- I'll spot you. I'll spot you.

33
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:50,026
Are you sure this is safe, Otis?

34
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:52,125
Peck! Come on, safe?

35
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:55,300
It's completely safe!
Since when isn't surfing safe?

36
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:56,629
He's got a point.

37
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:59,500
Okay, salt lick.

38
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:04,775
- It's go time!
- I'll try it. I'm down.

39
00:04:04,877 --> 00:04:06,344
- Shotgun!
- Piggyback!

40
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:08,744
Never! You are all gonna die.

41
00:04:11,184 --> 00:04:12,674
- Freddy?
- Nothing.

42
00:04:12,785 --> 00:04:14,616
Wait a second. Photo op.

43
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:16,086
Okay, get together!

44
00:04:21,227 --> 00:04:22,717
- Hey, Pig?
- What?

45
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:24,990
- Where'd you get that apple?
- This apple?

46
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:28,465
Oh, well,
it originally was attached to this.

47
00:04:32,372 --> 00:04:33,566
Otis?

48
00:04:33,673 --> 00:04:36,335
What? What? What happened?

49
00:04:37,176 --> 00:04:40,634
You know, it's times like this
when I really like to say...

50
00:04:41,047 --> 00:04:42,173
Oh, caca!

51
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,842
You didn't do that!

52
00:05:05,271 --> 00:05:07,796
Okay, okay! Look, this is bad enough!

53
00:05:07,907 --> 00:05:10,467
Please, no one scream, "Tree!"

54
00:05:10,877 --> 00:05:13,277
Tree!

55
00:05:21,087 --> 00:05:22,452
Let's surf!

56
00:05:32,231 --> 00:05:35,257
Hang on now, boys! Yeah! Hang hoof!

57
00:05:35,368 --> 00:05:38,269
Otis? Are we supposed to
not yell, "Rock"?

58
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:02,585
We got a gusher!

59
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,367
Chicken farm!

60
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:18,068
Oh, I get it.
We can't yell "Tree" or "Rock",

61
00:06:18,177 --> 00:06:19,804
but you get to yell, "Chicken farm."

62
00:06:33,359 --> 00:06:34,986
Morning, everyone.

63
00:06:35,628 --> 00:06:38,688
Okay, before we get started,
we have a birthday.

64
00:06:39,298 --> 00:06:42,131
Everett the dog turned 13 today.

65
00:06:43,202 --> 00:06:45,500
Boy, those dog years are rough, huh?

66
00:06:48,174 --> 00:06:49,732
Also, remember it's...

67
00:06:57,283 --> 00:06:58,477
Whassup?

68
00:06:59,685 --> 00:07:03,644
Hey, Pop. Look, I know you're probably
looking for an explanation regarding

69
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:07,817
the exploded chicken on me,
and the sticky black... The oil stuff.

70
00:07:11,564 --> 00:07:14,761
You are gonna love this! I'll tell you...
You the most, because

71
00:07:14,867 --> 00:07:17,028
you, my friend, are a laugher.
And every...

72
00:07:17,136 --> 00:07:19,536
- Didn't we all know that? Right?
- Just take a seat.

73
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:21,937
I'll... I'll take a seat.

74
00:07:25,878 --> 00:07:26,936
Cool.

75
00:07:28,915 --> 00:07:31,008
Oh, sorry about that.

76
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:34,580
Little tight.

77
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:38,390
As I was saying,

78
00:07:38,491 --> 00:07:40,982
remember tonight at the hoedown,
it's free cider night.

79
00:07:41,093 --> 00:07:44,756
Hey. Hey, Pig,
I think there's a dead bee in your nostril.

80
00:07:46,566 --> 00:07:47,590
That's not dead.

81
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:51,761
Okay, the first matter at hand:
Gray market goods.

82
00:07:52,004 --> 00:07:54,370
As if I needed to say it again.

83
00:07:54,707 --> 00:07:58,438
The purchase of human articles
from the gopher underground

84
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:00,578
is strictly prohibited.

85
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:02,870
<i>Hello, Moto!</i>

86
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:12,152
Hey, Otis.
Yeah, listen, I think your Nikes are...

87
00:08:12,258 --> 00:08:15,161
Yeah, this really isn't the best time.

88
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:17,796
Hang on a second. Frankie, come here.
Frankie, come here.

89
00:08:17,897 --> 00:08:20,092
No, I'm not... Come here. I'm not
gonna hurt you. Frankie, come here.

90
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:23,293
<i>I told you never to do that again,</i>
<i>as long as I live!</i>

91
00:08:23,402 --> 00:08:25,597
<i>Now, put it over there! Now!</i>

92
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:28,405
Sorry about that. Frankie's out of hand.

93
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:29,702
Oh, the Nikes. What's the make again?

94
00:08:29,809 --> 00:08:34,678
Yeah. Yeah, I really should go,
Mr. Jordan Air.

95
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,213
Wrong number.

96
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:38,146
Thank you.

97
00:08:40,953 --> 00:08:42,318
Second item.

98
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:46,283
Lest I remind you, this is coyote season.

99
00:08:46,392 --> 00:08:47,416
That's right.

100
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:50,325
These are ruthless
and desperate creatures.

101
00:08:50,897 --> 00:08:53,195
Rule number one: Stay in groups.

102
00:08:53,966 --> 00:08:58,494
Rule number two: Stay inside
the perimeter of the fence at all times.

103
00:08:59,171 --> 00:09:02,106
And number three: Be careful out there.

104
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,266
Okay, let's hit it.

105
00:09:09,815 --> 00:09:12,875
And leaving quickly. Walking out.
Walking out. Step, step, step wider...

106
00:09:12,985 --> 00:09:16,045
Otis, why don't you stick around
for a minute?

107
00:09:16,155 --> 00:09:17,713
He's scary. Bye.

108
00:09:18,157 --> 00:09:20,421
Okay, Miles. What do you think?

109
00:09:20,693 --> 00:09:22,354
I think you're lucky.

110
00:09:22,461 --> 00:09:24,520
Most cows only have four hooves,

111
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:27,098
but you're gonna have an extra one
right up your...

112
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:29,292
Okay, that's nice. Dad!

113
00:09:32,138 --> 00:09:33,969
- Sit.
- And I'm sitting.

114
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:36,772
Okay. First off,

115
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:40,039
I don't even want to know
who was on the other end of that phone.

116
00:09:40,146 --> 00:09:42,046
- It was the gophers, wasn't it?
- Well, I...

117
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:45,174
No, I don't want to know.
Was it the gophers?

118
00:09:45,651 --> 00:09:48,279
- Here's...
- No, don't. I don't want to know.

119
00:09:48,854 --> 00:09:52,119
Why do you do this to me?
How do you think that makes me look?

120
00:09:52,224 --> 00:09:53,987
So this... This is about you?

121
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,389
Where were you this morning, Otis?

122
00:09:56,495 --> 00:09:58,895
I was having a little fun.
I mean, you should try it.

123
00:09:58,998 --> 00:10:02,263
It starts with a smile,
then slowly builds and...

124
00:10:02,368 --> 00:10:05,064
You promised to help me
with the brush around the fence.

125
00:10:05,171 --> 00:10:07,071
You know it's coyote season.

126
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:12,008
Geez, coyotes. I don't get it.
What's the big deal? They're coyotes.

127
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:16,411
Them tiny, us big!
What are they gonna do?

128
00:10:16,515 --> 00:10:18,073
You have a lot to learn.

129
00:10:18,184 --> 00:10:20,243
And you know what,
I don't get the fence thing.

130
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:22,048
Really, it can't keep them out.

131
00:10:22,154 --> 00:10:25,282
That fence defines our space.

132
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:27,518
And as long as I'm still kicking,

133
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:31,859
no animal will be harmed
inside that fence.

134
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:34,159
Okay, that's what you do. You.

135
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:36,826
Okay, if you're trying to groom me
to be the big leader,

136
00:10:36,936 --> 00:10:39,097
just give it up. It's not me, Pop.

137
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:41,173
I mean, if I were in charge,
things would be different.

138
00:10:41,273 --> 00:10:44,436
Every animal for himself.
That's the way it should be.

139
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:45,868
Otis.

140
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:49,347
A strong man stands up for himself.

141
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:53,080
A stronger man stands up for others.

142
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,314
Oh, shoot. You know, I forgot my pen.

143
00:10:55,421 --> 00:10:58,049
- And your shift tonight?
- I'll be there.

144
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:00,648
Otis, you're gonna have to
grow up one day.

145
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:04,321
You'll never be happy
if you spend all your time goofing off.

146
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:06,762
No? Just watch me.

147
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:14,198
Manabunga!

148
00:11:21,213 --> 00:11:23,875
Freddy, is this great or what?

149
00:11:23,983 --> 00:11:27,919
Oh, yeah.
I could just eat your head right off!

150
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:32,323
I mean... You know, it's fun up here.

151
00:11:42,435 --> 00:11:43,402
Pip?

152
00:11:44,804 --> 00:11:46,237
I'd go with the wood on this one.

153
00:12:08,294 --> 00:12:11,730
That's what I'm talking about!
Sweet mama!

154
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:14,497
Hey, there's animals over there!

155
00:12:16,635 --> 00:12:18,500
Nice shoes.

156
00:12:18,771 --> 00:12:22,798
<i>Oh, doctor!</i>
<i>What a game we have here today!</i>

157
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:27,506
Yeah!

158
00:12:28,047 --> 00:12:30,811
<i>He got the ball on the 30.</i>
<i>He's down on the 20. Lifts it up...</i>

159
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,406
<i>It's a touchdown!</i>

160
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:34,782
Yeah!

161
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,288
Bacon!

162
00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:17,787
Hamburger!

163
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:19,455
Chorizo!

164
00:13:19,565 --> 00:13:22,090
- Filet!
- What are you doing?

165
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:25,904
I'm naming the kinds of cuts of meat
to the animal I'm jumping on.

166
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:26,972
Machaca!

167
00:13:27,072 --> 00:13:28,232
Pork chops!

168
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:30,205
Rump roast!

169
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:33,138
You know what?
You don't need to be doing this.

170
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:36,771
Oaty-oaty! Oaty-oaty!

171
00:13:37,516 --> 00:13:38,744
Hi, Oaty.

172
00:13:40,186 --> 00:13:42,586
Hey, Maddie. Looking good over there.

173
00:13:42,922 --> 00:13:44,981
Chubba Face, you crazy cow.

174
00:13:46,792 --> 00:13:48,487
Say, "I'm smooshy."

175
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:51,224
I am smooshy.

176
00:13:52,932 --> 00:13:54,456
Okay, now you.

177
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,601
Say, "Boy, is it windy."

178
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:59,162
Boy, is it windy.

179
00:14:02,575 --> 00:14:04,372
My turn, my turn.

180
00:14:05,711 --> 00:14:08,236
- Okay, chick. Just run along now.
- Bye, Oaty.

181
00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:13,209
All righty.

182
00:14:15,287 --> 00:14:16,845
Hey, who is she?

183
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:19,820
They just showed up.
Farmer took them in.

184
00:14:19,925 --> 00:14:21,620
Thank you, Farmer.

185
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:23,961
Yeah, something happened
with their herd.

186
00:14:24,063 --> 00:14:26,156
They're the only two that made it.

187
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:27,964
She needs a friend.

188
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:29,591
Wait, wait, wait!

189
00:14:30,102 --> 00:14:33,037
Excuse me, but I couldn't help
notice you over there.

190
00:14:34,506 --> 00:14:37,703
Hey! Oh, look at you. You're all...

191
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:40,804
- Pregnant?
- Yeah, sure. I mean...

192
00:14:40,913 --> 00:14:43,211
Really? 'Cause, I mean,
it isn't that noticeable, you know.

193
00:14:43,315 --> 00:14:45,044
I mean, especially when you
stand straight on,

194
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:46,708
and you don't look at it.

195
00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:48,719
You know, when you turn to the side,
it gets a little lumpy.

196
00:14:48,821 --> 00:14:51,051
I mean glowy. Glowy. It's a glow.

197
00:14:52,524 --> 00:14:53,923
I'm... I'm Otis.

198
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:57,961
Back off, Daisy.
There's an "L" on that boy's forehead.

199
00:14:58,097 --> 00:15:00,793
No, that's just me,
the contortion mouse.

200
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:03,793
C!

201
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,029
X!

202
00:15:05,137 --> 00:15:06,126
N!

203
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:09,002
- Q!
- Oh, man, you're killing me, dude.

204
00:15:10,276 --> 00:15:13,609
Look, I just wanted to welcome you
to the barnyard.

205
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:15,711
I'm sure that you and your...

206
00:15:16,181 --> 00:15:19,446
Not looking. The key word, "not".

207
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:22,281
Work with me. Not looking.

208
00:15:23,355 --> 00:15:24,754
This is my friend, Bessy.

209
00:15:24,857 --> 00:15:26,518
Yeah, she's a cupcake.

210
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,422
- It was nice to meet you, Otis.
- Yeah, too you.

211
00:15:31,797 --> 00:15:33,890
You know what? Switch those.

212
00:15:34,466 --> 00:15:35,831
Oh, boy.

213
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:39,735
There's nothing for you there,
but I kind of like her friend.

214
00:16:00,926 --> 00:16:01,893
He's out!

215
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:10,393
All clear! Sweet!

216
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:18,376
<i>Now, every heifer, every cow</i>

Wow! This is amazing.

244
00:17:55,707 --> 00:17:57,140
What you looking at?

245
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:58,834
What? You want some of this?

246
00:17:58,944 --> 00:18:00,741
Oh, yeah, I didn't think so.

247
00:18:01,513 --> 00:18:03,572
Sit right here, honey.

248
00:18:03,682 --> 00:18:05,707
The flowers are beautiful.

249
00:18:16,462 --> 00:18:19,659
See? On time, just like I...

250
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:20,891
Right.

251
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,961
Cramp! That's a cramp!

252
00:18:23,068 --> 00:18:24,558
Oh, it's cramping!

253
00:18:29,141 --> 00:18:30,836
And release.

254
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:33,275
- Hello, Son.
- Dad,

255
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,913
I've been thinking,

256
00:18:36,348 --> 00:18:38,407
and I'm willing to accept your apology.

257
00:18:38,517 --> 00:18:41,645
- Really?
- Sure. I mean, it's only right. I mean...

258
00:18:44,389 --> 00:18:45,447
Okay.

259
00:18:46,725 --> 00:18:51,025
I don't mean to let you down, Pop.
I'm just out trying to have some fun.

260
00:18:53,265 --> 00:18:55,165
It's a beautiful night.

261
00:18:55,267 --> 00:18:58,361
I remember when I used to
sit out here with your sister.

262
00:18:58,604 --> 00:19:00,663
- I don't have a sister.
- Oh, yeah.

263
00:19:01,206 --> 00:19:03,071
That was you, wasn't it?

264
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:05,667
Thank you, all right.

265
00:19:06,512 --> 00:19:08,002
So, are we okay?

266
00:19:09,014 --> 00:19:10,447
- We're okay.
- Great.

267
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:11,743
See, 'cause I wanted
to ask you something.

268
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:13,647
My friends are all going
to the barn tonight,

269
00:19:13,752 --> 00:19:15,947
and not that it matters either way to me,

270
00:19:16,054 --> 00:19:17,112
but evidently, I'm needed.

271
00:19:17,222 --> 00:19:19,383
I'm a sort of an integral part
of a musical number.

272
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:22,392
Yeah, I tried to tell them no, you know?
But they were just so...

273
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:25,054
I told them, "My dad's not gonna
wanna cover my shift.

274
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:29,032
"I mean, it's my shift, not his.
It isn't his!" You know?

275
00:19:29,134 --> 00:19:32,297
"I don't want to be selfish.
What's mine is mine, and..."

276
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:34,364
What do you think?

277
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:37,335
Otis...

278
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,678
I never thought
I was gonna amount to much.

279
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:48,718
I certainly didn't think
I'd be in charge of anything.

280
00:19:49,454 --> 00:19:51,615
But that all changed one day.

281
00:19:52,424 --> 00:19:54,619
It was the day you showed up.

282
00:19:55,727 --> 00:19:57,388
I head out into the meadow

283
00:19:57,496 --> 00:20:00,363
and I see this little baby calf all alone,

284
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:02,558
stumbling around.

285
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:05,530
You know,
before you became a nightmare.

286
00:20:07,005 --> 00:20:09,599
Well, I took you home that night,

287
00:20:11,777 --> 00:20:14,268
and I know it doesn't sound possible,

288
00:20:14,446 --> 00:20:16,539
but I looked up into the sky

289
00:20:17,149 --> 00:20:19,276
and I would have swore

290
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:21,614
I saw the stars dance.

291
00:20:23,322 --> 00:20:26,257
At that moment,
I knew my place was here,

292
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:28,790
taking care of things.

293
00:20:30,295 --> 00:20:32,763
I guess you helped me realize that.

294
00:20:33,865 --> 00:20:35,423
I love you, Son.

295
00:20:37,869 --> 00:20:39,996
- You still want to go, don't you?
- Yeah, I really do.

296
00:20:40,105 --> 00:20:43,734
Not that your stuff... You know, the stuff
you're saying isn't nifty and everything...

297
00:20:43,842 --> 00:20:45,400
No one says "nifty".

298
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:48,274
I say "nifty." I do, and sometimes
even "swifty." I'll say that.

299
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:49,938
Very impressive.

300
00:20:50,315 --> 00:20:53,079
Go ahead, have fun. I'll cover your shift.

301
00:20:53,452 --> 00:20:55,147
Thanks, Pop. You're the best.

302
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:56,653
- Otis?
- Yeah?

303
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:58,450
Be the stronger man.

304
00:20:58,557 --> 00:21:00,422
Yeah. Yeah, that's
that saying thing, right?

305
00:21:00,525 --> 00:21:02,254
"A strong man stands up for himself.

306
00:21:02,361 --> 00:21:05,353
"A stronger man can
bridge the gap between..."

307
00:21:05,464 --> 00:21:07,557
Got it locked in the vault.

308
00:21:09,868 --> 00:21:11,301
See? I learn.

309
00:21:23,081 --> 00:21:25,140
<i>Mr. Boombastic</i>

310
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:30,449
<i>What you want is a boombastic</i>
<i>Romantic, fantastic lover</i>

311
00:21:30,555 --> 00:21:34,116

<i>Say me fantastic</i>

312
00:21:34,226 --> 00:21:38,253
<i>Touch me in me back</i>
<i>She says I'm Mr. Romantic</i>

313
00:21:38,363 --> 00:21:40,228
<i>Call me fantastic</i>

314
00:21:40,332 --> 00:21:43,199
<i>Touch me in me back</i>
<i>She says I'm Mr. Ro...</i>

315
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:45,193
<i>Smooth</i>

316
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:48,398
Who's here? Moo! It's me! Moo!

317
00:21:48,507 --> 00:21:51,408
Whassup? Milk me!

318
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:52,807
Hey, babe.

319
00:21:55,547 --> 00:21:58,141
My barn. That's right, my barn.

320
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,579
You're late. Come on.

321
00:22:03,689 --> 00:22:05,782
He's a real winner, that one.

322
00:22:05,891 --> 00:22:08,382
Oh, stop. I think he's kind of cute.

323
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:10,859
<i>Lay down in my Jacuzzi</i>
<i>and get some bubble bath</i>

324
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:13,829
<i>Only sound you will hear</i>
<i>is the beating of my heart</i>

325
00:22:13,932 --> 00:22:16,867
<i>And we will mmm-mmm</i>
<i>And have some sweet pillow talk</i>

326
00:22:16,968 --> 00:22:22,270
<i>I'm Boombastic, really fantastic</i>
<i>Mr. Boom Boom Boom Boom</i>

327
00:22:22,774 --> 00:22:26,938
Give it up for the one and only,
Biggy Cheese!

328
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:29,746
We're gonna have some fun
tonight, y'all.

329
00:22:29,948 --> 00:22:32,439
Hey, Buck.
Get your hooves off the stage.

330
00:22:32,651 --> 00:22:34,710
You ain't in show business.

331
00:22:38,657 --> 00:22:41,387
What, were you raised in a barn?

332
00:22:46,231 --> 00:22:48,222
Well, you're a good horse. Okay...

333
00:22:49,134 --> 00:22:51,329
What you looking at, Turkey?

334
00:22:53,972 --> 00:22:56,133
Somebody pass me
the cranberry sauce.

335
00:22:57,743 --> 00:22:59,734
Dead turkey walking.

336
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:02,138
We all gonna die,
but we don't know the date.

337
00:23:02,247 --> 00:23:04,545
We know your date, Thanksgiving!

338
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:12,987
Okay, to kick things off tonight,
I got a special treat.

339
00:23:13,091 --> 00:23:15,059
Back by popular demand.

340
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,594
Ladies, this one's for you.

341
00:23:17,696 --> 00:23:21,462
Our own Otis and the Crew!

342
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:31,407
<i>Well, down on the farm</i>

343
00:23:32,444 --> 00:23:35,277
<i>Where they all ask for you</i>

344
00:23:41,686 --> 00:23:43,984
Parties all hours of the night.

345
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:49,420
What is that farmer up to?
You know what?

346
00:23:49,561 --> 00:23:52,189
- I'm gonna call someone.
- Oh, leave him be.

347
00:23:52,297 --> 00:23:55,266
Well, I'll just call whoever I want,
whenever I want to.

348
00:23:55,367 --> 00:23:56,959
That's exactly what I'll do.

349
00:23:57,068 --> 00:24:00,003
Because I know
what a rave is, Mr. Lump.

350
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:03,404
"I'm going to sit and watch TV
and be a lump."

351
00:24:03,508 --> 00:24:07,171
Okay, Mr. Lumpy. It's just not right.

352
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:11,912
<i>They all ask for you</i>

353
00:24:13,084 --> 00:24:15,746
<i>They all ask for you</i>

354
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:18,953
<i>Down on the farm</i>

355
00:24:20,659 --> 00:24:27,462
<i>They all ask for you</i>

356
00:24:46,785 --> 00:24:48,252
I'll check it.

357
00:24:51,723 --> 00:24:54,283
It's all right. Calm down.
It's just the pizza guy.

358
00:24:54,392 --> 00:24:55,882
I'm on it.

359
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:57,586
Watch out. I got it. I got it.

360
00:24:57,696 --> 00:24:59,163
Pizza, pizza, pizza.

361
00:25:04,603 --> 00:25:07,163
Thanks. You want change?

362
00:25:07,272 --> 00:25:08,603
No, keep it.

363
00:25:08,707 --> 00:25:11,369
So, you really ordered a lot of pizzas.

364
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:14,404
Well, yes.
We're having a big human party.

365
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:16,413
Just a party. A big one.

366
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:19,712
With us celebrating our humanness.

367
00:25:19,885 --> 00:25:22,615
- Dude, I love parties! Can I...
- No.

368
00:25:23,955 --> 00:25:26,890
Okay. Well, then, I'll see you.

369
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:34,590
Ouch!

370
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:37,334
My arm fell off.

371
00:25:37,435 --> 00:25:39,699
My fake arm, I mean.

372
00:25:40,405 --> 00:25:44,171
Wow, I am so sorry about that.

373
00:25:44,276 --> 00:25:46,870
- Do you need any help?
- No, I don't like help.

374
00:25:48,179 --> 00:25:52,240
It's just against my religion.
I'm a Nohelpian.

375
00:25:54,352 --> 00:25:56,547
Cool, I'm a Lutheran.

376
00:25:57,188 --> 00:25:58,416
What about this?

377
00:25:58,523 --> 00:26:00,957
You know what? You keep it.
It's dirty now.

378
00:26:01,426 --> 00:26:02,950
Really? All right.

379
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:05,256
Dude, I got a arm!

380
00:26:05,997 --> 00:26:08,397
Yeah! Righteous!

381
00:26:33,725 --> 00:26:36,990
<i>Well, I won't back down</i>

382
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:41,395
<i>No, I won't back down</i>

383
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:46,632
<i>You can stand me up</i>
<i>at the gates of hell</i>

384
00:26:46,738 --> 00:26:49,866
<i>But I won't back down</i>

385
00:26:50,909 --> 00:26:54,470
<i>Gonna stand my ground</i>

386
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:58,738
<i>Won't be turned around</i>

387
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:03,512
<i>And I'll keep this world</i>
<i>from dragging me down</i>

388
00:27:03,655 --> 00:27:06,920
<i>Gonna stand my ground</i>

389
00:28:02,047 --> 00:28:03,810
Good evening, ladies.

390
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:06,177
Sorry to call on you
so late in the evening,

391
00:28:06,284 --> 00:28:08,377
but we did have a previous engagement.

392
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:14,852
Now, we're gonna take six of you.

393
00:28:14,959 --> 00:28:17,757
Anyone makes a sound,
we don't mind the extra company.

394
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:20,126
Boys, take your pick.

395
00:28:20,498 --> 00:28:23,058
You won't be taking any hens tonight.

396
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:27,630
And you're gonna stop us?

397
00:28:28,339 --> 00:28:33,208
Is that what's gonna happen?
Are you gonna stop us, hen?

398
00:28:33,311 --> 00:28:35,643
How are you gonna do that?

399
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:41,644
No, he is.

400
00:28:45,523 --> 00:28:48,390
Ben. How are you, Ben?

401
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:51,060
We would've said hello,
had we seen you.

402
00:28:51,162 --> 00:28:52,993
Put the hen down, Dag.

403
00:28:53,531 --> 00:28:56,830
Sure, Ben. Whatever you say.

404
00:28:57,368 --> 00:29:00,064
We're just doing a little courting,
that's all.

405
00:29:00,171 --> 00:29:02,662
You know how much we like the hens.

406
00:29:04,375 --> 00:29:07,708
You know me, ladykiller.

407
00:29:08,546 --> 00:29:11,674
You have us
at a bit of a disadvantage here, Ben.

408
00:29:12,217 --> 00:29:13,809
There's six of us,

409
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:17,811
and only one old, fat you.

410
00:29:54,259 --> 00:29:56,819
Oh, baby! Party time!

411
00:31:10,401 --> 00:31:11,459
Otis!

412
00:31:12,136 --> 00:31:13,103
Otis!

413
00:31:17,242 --> 00:31:19,472
Otis! Otis!

414
00:31:20,078 --> 00:31:21,511
It's Ben.

415
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:32,823
Oh, no. No, no.

416
00:33:16,527 --> 00:33:19,496
Yeah. You hang on there, buddy.

417
00:33:28,473 --> 00:33:30,600
All right now, Otis. Just lift.

418
00:33:30,708 --> 00:33:33,768
Ten and two. Ten and two.

419
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:38,873
Not like that. Now lift, and two.

420
00:33:40,118 --> 00:33:41,415
You dog!

421
00:33:46,157 --> 00:33:47,920
Come here, fisherman.

422
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:05,937
What do we do now? Who's gonna
protect us from the coyotes?

423
00:34:06,277 --> 00:34:08,268
Anybody got a pistol?

424
00:34:08,813 --> 00:34:11,304
Order, here! Hey, am I bothering you?

425
00:34:11,416 --> 00:34:13,407
Let's get this meeting started.

426
00:34:13,518 --> 00:34:16,043
- Duke, who's gonna run the meeting?
- That's what the meeting's about.

427
00:34:16,154 --> 00:34:18,850
The meeting's about
finding someone to run the meeting?

428
00:34:18,956 --> 00:34:20,423
Is that a good idea?

429
00:34:20,525 --> 00:34:21,958
We should take a meeting about it.

430
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:24,358
Someone has to do this.
We don't have Ben.

431
00:34:24,462 --> 00:34:27,260
Therefore, I would like
to nominate myself.

432
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,490
Dogs are... Listen to me.

433
00:34:30,601 --> 00:34:33,695
Dogs are watchful,
they're loyal, and very protective.

434
00:34:33,805 --> 00:34:35,238
And they lick themselves.

435
00:34:35,339 --> 00:34:36,738
I don't want a leader who licks himself.

436
00:34:36,841 --> 00:34:38,103
- Me, neither.
- That's nasty.

437
00:34:38,209 --> 00:34:39,233
I can't even reach mine.

438
00:34:39,343 --> 00:34:40,708
I don't do that.

439
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:43,005
Anymore.

440
00:34:43,114 --> 00:34:46,379
One time, I was bored,
lonely, and a little snackish.

441
00:34:46,551 --> 00:34:48,542
Yeah, I saw you drink
out of a toilet once.

442
00:34:48,653 --> 00:34:51,918
- Hey, you drink potty water.
- You drink potty water!

443
00:34:52,523 --> 00:34:56,220
My bowl was empty, my friend.
Come on, we're getting off track here.

444
00:34:57,228 --> 00:35:00,823
Duke, with all respect,
I think there are certain traits

445
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:03,400
that would make you unqualified
to be leader.

446
00:35:03,501 --> 00:35:04,991
Yeah, such as?

447
00:35:14,879 --> 00:35:16,210
Your point?

448
00:35:16,514 --> 00:35:18,675
Hey, come on, I do that for fun,

449
00:35:19,217 --> 00:35:21,583
not 'cause I have to. Go on!

450
00:35:33,865 --> 00:35:37,824
So, big deal. I fetch balls.
One little flaw.

451
00:35:47,912 --> 00:35:52,076
This doesn't mean anything.

452
00:35:55,019 --> 00:35:58,648
All right, all right, let's take a vote.
Come on, let's take a vote here.

453
00:35:58,756 --> 00:36:01,486
All those in favor
of me being the new leader.

454
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:08,692
Those opposed?

455
00:36:10,735 --> 00:36:13,203
- Can you see my hand?
- Listen now, listen up.

456
00:36:13,304 --> 00:36:17,104
You all know that Ben always
intended for Otis to take his place.

457
00:36:17,208 --> 00:36:19,199
All right, Otis is in charge.

458
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:21,471
I second that motion. Sweet!

459
00:36:27,451 --> 00:36:28,782
Here we go.

460
00:36:30,922 --> 00:36:32,856
Try and catch me.

461
00:36:34,959 --> 00:36:36,426
Stay in line.

462
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:38,893
Maddie, we don't want to lose you.

463
00:36:54,011 --> 00:36:56,309
Oh, I think that would be just fine.

464
00:36:57,915 --> 00:36:59,940
Oaty-oaty! Hey, Oaty!

465
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:08,453
Hey, Maddie, now really isn't a good...

466
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:12,259
What are you doing?
Would you stop? Come on.

467
00:37:13,097 --> 00:37:15,930
Hey, hey, hey, guys, guys...

468
00:37:16,033 --> 00:37:18,399
- Oh, goodness gracious.
- What is it? What is it?

469
00:37:34,318 --> 00:37:37,048
Otis, it's a madhouse! Isn't it just great?

470
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:41,758
You got hit with a soccer ball.

471
00:38:01,412 --> 00:38:04,245
I thought I'd be the first
to congratulate you, Otis.

472
00:38:04,348 --> 00:38:06,782
- You're in charge now.
- I'm what?

473
00:38:07,551 --> 00:38:09,485
Miles, I am not in charge, okay?

474
00:38:09,587 --> 00:38:13,079
I don't do "In charge".

475
00:38:13,758 --> 00:38:16,226
- This is not my responsibility.
- I hear you.

476
00:38:16,327 --> 00:38:18,955
But you were elected fair and square.

477
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:21,628
Congratulations, boss.

478
00:38:25,603 --> 00:38:26,934
Hey!

479
00:38:31,175 --> 00:38:33,268
Have you all lost your mind?

480
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:36,374
It's daylight.
The Farmer's gonna be back.

481
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,779
This is so off limits.

482
00:38:40,551 --> 00:38:42,018
Come on, Otis,

483
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:46,589
I know your weak spot.

484
00:38:47,258 --> 00:38:49,226
Wild Mike!

485
00:38:49,694 --> 00:38:51,958
- What?
- Wild Mike.

486
00:38:52,296 --> 00:38:55,823
Wild Mike. Wild Mike.

487
00:38:55,933 --> 00:38:57,400
- Wild Mike.
- I'm not doing this, okay?

488
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:59,059
- There's no way this is happening.
- Wild Mike. Wild Mike.

489
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:00,933
- Everybody just get back to your...
- Wild Mike. Wild Mike.

490
00:39:01,038 --> 00:39:04,701
- Return to your designated quadrants.
- Wild Mike. Wild Mike.

491
00:39:05,643 --> 00:39:08,840
Wild Mike! Wild Mike!

492
00:39:08,979 --> 00:39:10,674
- This is ridiculous!
- Wild Mike!

493
00:39:10,781 --> 00:39:14,114
I'm not gonna dance
just because you're getting Wild Mike.

494
00:39:14,618 --> 00:39:16,381
- Pip, help me out here.
- Wild Mike. Wild Mike.

495
00:39:16,487 --> 00:39:20,753
You can't fight it, Otis.
You're a born party animal.

496
00:39:21,225 --> 00:39:24,956
Wild Mike! Wild Mike! Wild Mike!

497
00:39:25,062 --> 00:39:28,361
Wild Mike! Wild Mike! Wild Mike!

498
00:39:33,938 --> 00:39:35,872
Let's boogie!

499
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:43,806
<i>We're heading for the West</i>
<i>Not heading for the East</i>

500
00:39:43,914 --> 00:39:47,213
<i>We're gonna live our dream</i>
<i>'Cause we're wild and free</i>

501
00:39:47,318 --> 00:39:48,910
Look at that freaky thing.

502
00:39:49,019 --> 00:39:50,884
What kind of animal is that?

503
00:39:50,988 --> 00:39:53,479
I don't know, but he sure can dance.

504
00:40:08,305 --> 00:40:11,536
I say, let's kill it.
Give me that piece of wood over there.

505
00:40:24,121 --> 00:40:27,488
Sweet legs! Get the sweet legs!
I got the sweet legs!

506
00:41:11,836 --> 00:41:12,860
Moo?

507
00:41:15,072 --> 00:41:16,562
What did you do that for?

508
00:41:16,674 --> 00:41:19,108
What else was I gonna do? He saw you.

509
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:21,235
You could have killed him!

510
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:26,472
I got a pulse.

511
00:41:28,853 --> 00:41:32,311
Oh, this is bad. This is bad.
This is so bad.

512
00:41:32,423 --> 00:41:33,822
Baaad.

513
00:41:33,924 --> 00:41:37,951
Everybody, just calm down.
Just calm down, all right?

514
00:41:38,062 --> 00:41:41,225
What are we gonna do?
What are we gonna do?

515
00:41:43,901 --> 00:41:44,925
What?

516
00:41:45,035 --> 00:41:47,196
Come on. You're our leader. Lead us.

517
00:41:47,304 --> 00:41:49,431
That does not apply to this.

518
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:53,408
This is a totally, situationally
different suspect.

519
00:41:53,944 --> 00:41:55,434
Hey, whoa, no.

520
00:41:55,546 --> 00:41:58,276
- We gotta ditch the body.
- Stop it!

521
00:41:58,382 --> 00:42:01,510
He knows too much.
We gotta take care of him.

522
00:42:01,619 --> 00:42:05,146
- We gotta whack him.
- There will be no whacking, okay?

523
00:42:05,256 --> 00:42:07,451
The Farmer's a good guy.
He's been good to us.

524
00:42:07,558 --> 00:42:09,753
He's a vegan, God bless him.

525
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:13,023
And what is a vegan, again?

526
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:14,222
I know this one.

527
00:42:14,331 --> 00:42:16,697
No, I got it. It means
you can't eat anything with a face.

528
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,495
No, no, no, that's a vegetarian.

529
00:42:18,602 --> 00:42:20,570
Vegetarians have to eat
in the dark, right?

530
00:42:20,671 --> 00:42:22,298
That's a vampire. Come on.

531
00:42:22,406 --> 00:42:23,498
You can't eat cheese?

532
00:42:23,607 --> 00:42:27,008
It's not just cheese.
Vegans can't have any dairy products.

533
00:42:27,111 --> 00:42:28,840
- Cake?
- Cake has egg products.

534
00:42:28,946 --> 00:42:30,436
But you can't have any dairy.

535
00:42:31,181 --> 00:42:34,912
No dairy? I love dairy.
Does that mean I can't be a vegan?

536
00:42:35,019 --> 00:42:37,715
I love the smell of bacon.
There, I said it.

537
00:42:42,092 --> 00:42:43,286
Would you not do that?

538
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:45,919
It's not like we have a lot of options.

539
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:49,488
Boy, that's a doozy.
That thing's bigger than me.

540
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:50,589
Push it.

541
00:42:50,701 --> 00:42:53,534
- He wakes up, you got my back, right?
- Yeah.

542
00:43:01,111 --> 00:43:02,373
Come on. Come on.

543
00:43:02,479 --> 00:43:06,711
Okay, watch this. Off his nose,
on the belly, on the floor. Check it.

544
00:43:14,925 --> 00:43:16,051
Book.

545
00:43:24,468 --> 00:43:26,868
Okay, now.
He was sitting here, he was reading.

546
00:43:26,971 --> 00:43:30,168
- Something fell on his head, and...
- I got it.

547
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:37,542
Too light.
Couldn't cause a bump like that.

548
00:43:37,648 --> 00:43:39,172
I bet it could.

549
00:43:40,684 --> 00:43:43,517
Would you cut it out?
We need something bigger.

550
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:45,418
Can I have the apple?

551
00:43:47,725 --> 00:43:49,522
What's with the look?

552
00:44:06,143 --> 00:44:07,667
He's buying it.

553
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:10,875
He's not buying it.

554
00:44:12,383 --> 00:44:13,907
He's buying it.

555
00:44:14,752 --> 00:44:16,447
He's not buying it.

556
00:44:17,421 --> 00:44:19,981
No, he's buying it.

557
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:39,908
Will you stop doing that?

558
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:44,071
Well, unless you get him a blindfold,
I'm going to kick him!

559
00:44:44,748 --> 00:44:46,272
Okay, let's go.

560
00:45:05,969 --> 00:45:08,062
There. See? Good as new.

561
00:45:08,172 --> 00:45:10,367
I'll tell you,
this being in charge thing isn't so tough.

562
00:45:10,474 --> 00:45:14,103
You know what I'm talking about?
You know what I'm talking about. Yeah.

563
00:45:25,289 --> 00:45:28,884
Yeah, hi. Hey, there.
Having a good day? Yeah.

564
00:45:30,427 --> 00:45:33,021
So, this was Otis's idea?

565
00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:36,156
Oh, yeah.
We're like the second line of defense.

566
00:45:36,266 --> 00:45:40,930
We see or hear anything suspicious,
and I just signal Otis with a crow.

567
00:45:41,038 --> 00:45:44,405
And I've really been
working on it. Listen.

568
00:45:53,350 --> 00:45:55,682
Well, you know, in the moment,
it'll be really strong.

569
00:45:55,786 --> 00:45:58,380
But for now, we just stand watch.

570
00:45:58,489 --> 00:46:00,480
Yeah, watch.

571
00:46:10,534 --> 00:46:12,297
Come and get it!

572
00:46:12,903 --> 00:46:14,894
Freddy, you okay?

573
00:46:15,005 --> 00:46:17,906
Boneless white meat!
What? I'm not hungry!

574
00:46:18,008 --> 00:46:21,205
I mean, I don't wanna eat anyone...
Thing... You...

575
00:46:21,311 --> 00:46:23,643
What happened? What? What? What?

576
00:46:27,951 --> 00:46:32,752
Okay, quick little once
around the barnyard, then, hello, party!

577
00:46:39,496 --> 00:46:43,523
Hey, look at this.
It's our new inside connection.

578
00:46:44,234 --> 00:46:45,826
Congrats, Otis.

579
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:48,965
Oh, will you look at that?

580
00:46:52,676 --> 00:46:54,541
Don't wake up the cow.

581
00:47:05,689 --> 00:47:07,714
That's called cowtipping.

582
00:47:11,862 --> 00:47:13,887
Oh, that so steams me!

583
00:47:14,131 --> 00:47:16,395
Man, I wish I could get
a hold of that little... I would...

584
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:18,695
Hey, I'm in charge, right?

585
00:47:18,802 --> 00:47:22,101
Oh, we are so talking.
Are we not talking?

586
00:47:22,206 --> 00:47:25,607
- Talking the talk and walking the walk.
- Walkie-talkie, huh?

587
00:47:25,709 --> 00:47:26,698
Let's go.

588
00:47:27,144 --> 00:47:30,238
Then I said, "That's called cowtipping."

589
00:47:38,789 --> 00:47:41,986
I hear music over there again.
Do you hear music?

590
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:44,520
That farmer's out of control.

591
00:47:45,128 --> 00:47:48,188
We should call someone.
We should call someone.

592
00:47:50,234 --> 00:47:51,997
- I smell buttermilk.
- Shut up! Shut up!

593
00:47:52,102 --> 00:47:54,696
- What's that smell?
- Stop it! Stop it!

594
00:48:06,583 --> 00:48:08,915
Randall, there is a cow outside.

595
00:48:10,487 --> 00:48:13,615
This is a cow farm.
You're gonna find cows outside.

596
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:15,521
No, I mean right outside.

597
00:48:15,626 --> 00:48:20,222
Right outside this house,
looming like a ghost. Like a reaper.

598
00:48:20,330 --> 00:48:23,458
No, cows don't like houses much.

599
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:27,930
They prefer it out in the meadow,
where they can get a graze on.

600
00:48:28,338 --> 00:48:32,240
Nathan Randall the Third,
I am not crazy.

601
00:48:32,609 --> 00:48:35,339
I am medicated
for a chemical imbalance.

602
00:48:35,746 --> 00:48:39,409
Don't you sit there
and think that I am crazy.

603
00:48:41,518 --> 00:48:44,112
Your mind's gone, woman.

604
00:48:44,221 --> 00:48:46,883
Where'd it go? I don't know.

605
00:48:46,990 --> 00:48:48,617
It's gone.

606
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:55,497
- Oh geez, you're on my foot again.
- Sorry.

607
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:58,864
This is so sweet.
This is so wicked sweet.

608
00:48:58,969 --> 00:49:00,834
I love the new you, Otis.

609
00:49:00,938 --> 00:49:03,202
Okay, lgg,
you remember how to do this?

610
00:49:03,307 --> 00:49:04,899
- Oh, he remembers.
- I remember.

611
00:49:05,008 --> 00:49:06,669
- Yeah, he remembers.
- He's remembering.

612
00:49:06,777 --> 00:49:07,801
Right now.

613
00:49:23,527 --> 00:49:26,826
Well, pinch me, I'm dreaming.
Here is a first.

614
00:49:26,930 --> 00:49:29,262
Otis joining us on a joyride.

615
00:49:29,366 --> 00:49:33,632
- That's the animal sin of sins, huh?
- "Sin of sins," I like that.

616
00:49:33,737 --> 00:49:36,001
Hey, old Bud. Bud, you bring the stuff?

617
00:49:36,106 --> 00:49:38,700
It's right here.

618
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:41,403
- Show it. Show it.
- It's right here.

619
00:49:41,511 --> 00:49:42,808
- Show it.
- It's right here.

620
00:49:42,913 --> 00:49:44,505
- Show it.
- It's right there.

621
00:49:47,451 --> 00:49:49,817
We're rebels! We're rebels!

622
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:51,581
We're the wildest!

623
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:53,547
There they are.

624
00:49:58,628 --> 00:50:01,392
- Too bad we can't go in there.
- Yeah.

625
00:50:01,498 --> 00:50:03,090
Breaks my heart.

626
00:50:11,775 --> 00:50:13,800
Now remember, honey, I told you,

627
00:50:13,910 --> 00:50:16,572
we can't be staying out this late
on a school night.

628
00:50:17,347 --> 00:50:19,440
"We can't be staying out late."

629
00:50:22,185 --> 00:50:24,449
Whatever. I'll do what I want.

630
00:50:24,921 --> 00:50:28,789
Do what I want, when I want,
'cause I want to do it.

631
00:50:32,662 --> 00:50:34,994
You've come to the wrong place.

632
00:50:43,373 --> 00:50:45,398
- What is that?
- I'm lactose intolerant.

633
00:50:45,509 --> 00:50:48,137
- Oh, man.
- Here we go. I know.

634
00:50:48,478 --> 00:50:50,878
- One, two...
- Yeah.

635
00:50:50,981 --> 00:50:52,073
Two, yeah.

636
00:50:52,349 --> 00:50:53,782
Moo!

637
00:50:59,289 --> 00:51:01,723
That's called boytipping!

638
00:51:07,564 --> 00:51:09,532
- Let's get out of here!
- Come on, move it!

639
00:51:09,633 --> 00:51:11,396
Let me out!

640
00:51:12,402 --> 00:51:14,267
Okay, go!

641
00:51:21,011 --> 00:51:22,706
Never go to meadows.
Never go to meadows.

642
00:51:22,813 --> 00:51:24,872
Never go to meadows.
Never go to meadows.

643
00:51:24,981 --> 00:51:26,642
Treat cows nicely.

644
00:51:26,850 --> 00:51:28,750
Okay, no more Red Bull.

645
00:51:34,491 --> 00:51:38,154
Put crowns on our heads,
'cause we are the kings!

646
00:51:48,638 --> 00:51:50,367
Did you see his face?

647
00:51:50,474 --> 00:51:51,600
- Price...
- Less.

648
00:51:51,708 --> 00:51:52,697
- Price...
- Less.

649
00:51:52,809 --> 00:51:53,776
- Pr...
- Ice...

650
00:51:53,877 --> 00:51:54,866
Less.

651
00:51:57,481 --> 00:52:00,575
A toast! To a new world order.

652
00:52:00,684 --> 00:52:02,948
We are calling the shots now!

653
00:52:03,053 --> 00:52:05,453
- Yeah, it's all about us now.
- You've got that right, Otis.

654
00:52:05,555 --> 00:52:07,853
Nothing can touch us.

655
00:52:10,393 --> 00:52:11,985
Oh, man! Oh, man!

656
00:52:12,095 --> 00:52:13,790
- Oh, man!
- Man, oh, man!

657
00:52:13,897 --> 00:52:15,694
Let me out! You gotta let me out!

658
00:52:15,799 --> 00:52:19,098
<i>Pull over to the side of the road.</i>

659
00:52:19,402 --> 00:52:21,165
Oh, no, they're talking to us now.

660
00:52:21,271 --> 00:52:23,330
Pull over! You gotta pull over!

661
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:25,169
We can't pull over!

662
00:52:25,275 --> 00:52:26,537
Hang on!

663
00:52:26,643 --> 00:52:28,838
What could be worse than this?

664
00:52:30,547 --> 00:52:32,879
What we got here
is probably some teenagers

665
00:52:32,983 --> 00:52:35,508
going out for a joyride
in their mom's car.

666
00:52:35,619 --> 00:52:38,952
Yeah, we'll shake them up a bit,
send them home. You know kids.

667
00:52:39,055 --> 00:52:42,115
Nothing a little strip search
won't cure, yeah.

668
00:52:43,326 --> 00:52:45,191
Is this thing still on?

669
00:52:45,395 --> 00:52:46,794
Is that a camera?

670
00:52:46,897 --> 00:52:48,228
- This is it. Goodbye.
- They're taping <i>Cops.</i>

671
00:52:48,331 --> 00:52:52,028
Mommy! Mooo-mmy!

672
00:52:52,135 --> 00:52:56,003
Hey, relax. We can lose them.
I mean, it's just a car, right?

673
00:52:56,339 --> 00:52:59,274
It's a chopper! It's a chopper!

674
00:52:59,709 --> 00:53:01,677
We're gonna die!

675
00:53:01,778 --> 00:53:05,373
<i>We interrupt this program with</i>
<i>a breaking news story. Police are in...</i>

676
00:53:05,482 --> 00:53:08,508
Would you look at that?
The world is going crazy.

677
00:53:08,618 --> 00:53:12,952
These kids get all hopped up on
Diet Coke and Jolly Ranchers and just...

678
00:53:13,657 --> 00:53:14,919
That's our car!

679
00:53:16,493 --> 00:53:21,055
That was a hoof.
There's a cow in our car! That is a hoof!

680
00:53:28,305 --> 00:53:30,364
Yes, this is Nora Beady.

681
00:53:30,473 --> 00:53:32,338
What do you mean, "What now?"

682
00:53:32,442 --> 00:53:36,378
My car is on TV,
and I think there's a cow in it.

683
00:53:36,479 --> 00:53:40,347
And I saw a cow outside my window.
I think they may be linked.

684
00:53:41,651 --> 00:53:44,051
Don't think I can't call again, Gary.

685
00:53:48,258 --> 00:53:49,987
Oh, that's nice. Good.

686
00:53:51,294 --> 00:53:54,593
They're gonna catch us
and they're gonna dissect us.

687
00:53:56,132 --> 00:53:57,895
We are ditching out!

688
00:54:08,211 --> 00:54:11,840
Two all-beef patties, that's our future!

689
00:54:16,519 --> 00:54:17,713
Out! Run!

690
00:54:17,821 --> 00:54:19,789
- Run!
- Stop touching me!

691
00:54:20,991 --> 00:54:22,959
They're making a run for it. Let's go.
Come on.

692
00:54:23,059 --> 00:54:26,893
<i>This is Gray Badger in Chopper 219.</i>
<i>We've got suspects in sight.</i>

693
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:29,224
I'm chafing!

694
00:54:29,532 --> 00:54:31,591
Okay. Hurry up, fellows.
They're right over there.

695
00:54:31,701 --> 00:54:32,793
Oh, milk me!

696
00:54:32,902 --> 00:54:33,926
Okay, here we go! Here we go!

697
00:54:34,037 --> 00:54:35,026
Milk me!

698
00:54:35,138 --> 00:54:36,469
Geez, these guys are big.

699
00:54:36,573 --> 00:54:37,733
I see them over there.

700
00:54:37,841 --> 00:54:39,308
Cut it right!

701
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:45,438
We got them!

702
00:55:04,534 --> 00:55:07,671
Could you guys believe that?
Did you guys see me?

703
00:55:08,405 --> 00:55:10,270
Me, I am fearless, baby.

704
00:55:10,373 --> 00:55:12,432
- Oh, yeah, fear...
- Less.

705
00:55:12,776 --> 00:55:14,971
I think I rolled over my foot.

706
00:55:15,745 --> 00:55:18,270
We left it the same way we found it.

707
00:55:23,219 --> 00:55:27,656
Okay, toodle-oo, Otis.
Same time tomorrow night?

708
00:55:28,024 --> 00:55:31,687
Hey, guys, can you imagine
Ben doing something like that?

709
00:55:33,296 --> 00:55:35,161
- No way. No way.
- We'd be in trouble.

710
00:55:35,265 --> 00:55:36,698
- Trou...
- Ble.

711
00:55:58,088 --> 00:56:01,353
Okay, explain to me exactly
why are we doing this?

712
00:56:01,458 --> 00:56:03,585
Because it's what my dad would do.

713
00:56:03,693 --> 00:56:06,093
Why don't you just go have fun,
all right? I can do this.

714
00:56:06,196 --> 00:56:08,892
No way. We're homeboys.
I'm here with you.

715
00:56:09,032 --> 00:56:10,329
Really, it's all right.

716
00:56:10,433 --> 00:56:12,492
Okay, I tried! Later, dude.

717
00:56:12,602 --> 00:56:15,571
I'll bring you back a drink or something.
Be back.

718
00:56:22,345 --> 00:56:25,405
Come on back, I'm right here.

719
00:56:26,116 --> 00:56:27,276
Mind if I join you?

720
00:56:27,384 --> 00:56:31,343
No. I mean, sure. I no mind you...

721
00:56:31,621 --> 00:56:33,282
Geez, I can't even talk to you!

722
00:56:34,891 --> 00:56:36,552
Hang on a second.

723
00:56:40,630 --> 00:56:42,825
Here. You know, just let me...

724
00:56:42,932 --> 00:56:45,696
No, I can still sit on my own, I think.

725
00:56:46,703 --> 00:56:49,638
Oh, my gosh!
Oh, my gosh, the baby's coming!

726
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:50,831
What?

727
00:56:51,775 --> 00:56:53,367
I made you jump.

728
00:56:53,843 --> 00:56:56,937
Nice. Nice. Thank you.
I about swallowed my cud.

729
00:57:00,150 --> 00:57:02,584
- It's beautiful, isn't it?
- My cud?

730
00:57:03,753 --> 00:57:07,245
- The night.
- Yeah, that, too. Yeah, it's nice.

731
00:57:10,427 --> 00:57:12,691
My dad had a thing about stars.

732
00:57:14,197 --> 00:57:16,825
- Tell me, what was he like?
- My pop?

733
00:57:17,467 --> 00:57:20,300
He was amazing.
Bigger than life, you know?

734
00:57:20,703 --> 00:57:22,898
Funny, we're not even related.

735
00:57:23,206 --> 00:57:25,868
He found me and he took me in.

736
00:57:27,210 --> 00:57:31,044
I never thought about it before,
but everything he did was for me.

737
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:34,110
He's the only family I've ever known.

738
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:39,316
The last time we talked,
he told me that the night he found me

739
00:57:39,422 --> 00:57:44,359
he looked up into the sky
and he said that the stars...

740
00:57:47,597 --> 00:57:49,121
God, I miss him.

741
00:57:52,802 --> 00:57:56,260
What about you?
I mean, if that's too personal, you know.

742
00:57:56,372 --> 00:57:59,466
If I'm overstepping like a boundary or...

743
00:58:00,343 --> 00:58:02,504
You know what? Too bad. Cough it up.

744
00:58:02,612 --> 00:58:03,704
Okay.

745
00:58:05,615 --> 00:58:07,515
Well, where do I start?

746
00:58:08,551 --> 00:58:12,009
I was married, and life was good.

747
00:58:14,624 --> 00:58:17,457
Yeah. It seems like
forever ago now, but...

748
00:58:18,027 --> 00:58:20,325
One day, a bad storm rolled in.

749
00:58:21,297 --> 00:58:25,427
Bessy and I were in the meadow
and we found a place on high ground.

750
00:58:26,803 --> 00:58:28,668
But when we went home,

751
00:58:30,206 --> 00:58:34,006
well, everyone was gone.

752
00:58:37,914 --> 00:58:39,347
You know what I think?

753
00:58:39,449 --> 00:58:42,350
I think some good things are gonna
start happening to you and me.

754
00:59:47,550 --> 00:59:50,075
What, do you wanna be a hero, cow?

755
01:00:04,934 --> 01:00:07,494
Hey, you're Ben's kid.

756
01:00:08,204 --> 01:00:09,762
Otis, right?

757
01:00:10,740 --> 01:00:13,334
So they left you in charge?

758
01:00:15,645 --> 01:00:17,408
Oh, that's precious.

759
01:00:19,148 --> 01:00:21,742
You thought you could fill his shoes?

760
01:00:23,553 --> 01:00:25,748
Otis, where were you?

761
01:00:26,222 --> 01:00:31,159
Were you off having fun?
Laughing with your barnyard buddies?

762
01:00:31,260 --> 01:00:33,751
Yeah, you could have made a difference
had you been there for him,

763
01:00:33,863 --> 01:00:34,989
but you weren't. Were you?

764
01:00:36,232 --> 01:00:40,293
Okay, from here on out,
this is the way it's gonna work.

765
01:00:41,037 --> 01:00:44,564
We show up, you look the other way.

766
01:00:44,907 --> 01:00:47,535
A few animals missing here and there.

767
01:00:47,644 --> 01:00:50,579
Hey, it's the natural order of things.

768
01:00:51,047 --> 01:00:53,140
It'll be our little secret.

769
01:00:53,783 --> 01:00:56,343
Oh, and Ben's kid,

770
01:00:56,452 --> 01:01:00,047
if you should think about getting
a sudden burst of courage,

771
01:01:00,156 --> 01:01:02,647
we slaughter every animal in sight.

772
01:01:02,759 --> 01:01:05,819
Now, you go back,
make everyone feel all safe,

773
01:01:05,928 --> 01:01:09,364
and we'll be seeing you tomorrow night.
That's a date.

774
01:01:11,734 --> 01:01:13,258
See you around.

775
01:01:15,772 --> 01:01:17,706
"Round." You're fat.

776
01:02:21,771 --> 01:02:23,033
Hey, Pop.

777
01:02:23,806 --> 01:02:26,775
I wanted to come by and...

778
01:02:29,812 --> 01:02:32,781
Look, you were just a great dad.

779
01:02:35,218 --> 01:02:36,708
You see, I...

780
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:41,814
I don't know what I was thinking,
but, for a minute, I actually thought

781
01:02:41,924 --> 01:02:43,892
I could take your place.

782
01:02:45,461 --> 01:02:47,292
But those coyotes?

783
01:02:48,131 --> 01:02:51,692
I mean, you'd have stood up to them
and you wouldn't have backed down.

784
01:02:53,503 --> 01:02:56,472
I gotta tell you, I was so afraid.

785
01:02:59,075 --> 01:03:03,239
You know, I know I always said
that I wasn't you, and I'm not.

786
01:03:05,848 --> 01:03:07,440
But I wish I was.

787
01:03:09,485 --> 01:03:11,214
I can't do it, Pop.

788
01:03:11,854 --> 01:03:13,219
I gotta go.

789
01:03:14,390 --> 01:03:15,721
I'm sorry.

790
01:03:25,268 --> 01:03:27,463
And Duke will handle things,
and everything will be fine.

791
01:03:27,570 --> 01:03:30,835
Wait. What are you talking about?

792
01:03:30,973 --> 01:03:32,736
Could you just not say anything?

793
01:03:32,842 --> 01:03:35,743
Okay, I don't want to make
a big thing about this.

794
01:03:35,845 --> 01:03:39,508
Hey, everybody!
Otis is leaving the barnyard!

795
01:03:40,817 --> 01:03:43,115
- What's going on?
- I don't believe it.

796
01:03:50,026 --> 01:03:51,721
Oat, seriously,

797
01:03:51,828 --> 01:03:56,128
I mean, you and me,
we're like best friends.

798
01:03:56,232 --> 01:03:57,961
No, Pip. It's over!

799
01:03:58,434 --> 01:04:01,961
I'm leaving, all right? No big whoop.
Continue your day.

800
01:04:02,471 --> 01:04:04,496
Come on, Otis, we'll do what you say.

801
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:06,575
That's the point.
I don't want you to do what I say.

802
01:04:06,676 --> 01:04:08,473
I don't want any of you
to have to listen to me.

803
01:04:08,578 --> 01:04:10,341
Don't listen to him!

804
01:04:11,180 --> 01:04:13,045
Stop doing what I say!

805
01:04:14,217 --> 01:04:19,120
Okay, so what you're saying is,
you'll stay if we don't do what you say.

806
01:04:19,222 --> 01:04:20,416
Dead bee.

807
01:04:20,890 --> 01:04:22,187
Thanks.

808
01:04:23,226 --> 01:04:24,716
Again, alive.

809
01:04:24,827 --> 01:04:27,261
Duke, you're in charge.
Get the dogs together.

810
01:04:27,363 --> 01:04:29,456
You guys can handle things
better than I ever could.

811
01:04:29,565 --> 01:04:31,294
Sure, Otis. If you say.

812
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:34,233
I've got my own life to lead, all right?
I don't belong here anymore.

813
01:04:55,524 --> 01:04:57,890
- Hi.
- Hey.

814
01:04:59,128 --> 01:05:03,155
What happened, Otis?
Oh, please don't say, "Nothing."

815
01:05:04,467 --> 01:05:06,367
Look, it's complicated.

816
01:05:06,469 --> 01:05:10,064
If you're hurting, let me help.
I'd like to help.

817
01:05:12,475 --> 01:05:15,035
You know what happened?
I froze. Okay?

818
01:05:15,378 --> 01:05:19,838
Last night, I didn't run the coyotes off.
I couldn't do anything.

819
01:05:20,883 --> 01:05:24,148
They're gonna come back tonight,
and I can't protect anyone.

820
01:05:24,253 --> 01:05:28,815
Everyone here, they all trust me.
And I can't protect a single one of them.

821
01:05:30,459 --> 01:05:33,986
Otis, the best leader
isn't the biggest or the strongest.

822
01:05:34,463 --> 01:05:37,432
The best leader is the one
who cares the most.

823
01:05:37,967 --> 01:05:41,994
Yeah, that's a nice thought, Daisy.
That's a really nice thought.

824
01:05:43,272 --> 01:05:47,174
I'll tell you one thing.
I am really going to miss Bessy.

825
01:05:53,049 --> 01:05:56,314
Okay. If this is what you have to do,
I understand.

826
01:05:56,953 --> 01:05:59,581
But I just want you to know one thing.

827
01:05:59,789 --> 01:06:03,555
Even if you do leave, I believe in you.

828
01:06:15,905 --> 01:06:17,873
Otis! Otis!

829
01:06:24,313 --> 01:06:26,747
All right, Peck, take it easy.
What's the matter?

830
01:06:27,183 --> 01:06:30,778
They took... We got to... Come on!

831
01:06:33,756 --> 01:06:35,417
I found him, guys!

832
01:06:37,860 --> 01:06:40,124
Otis, the coyotes. It just happened.

833
01:06:40,229 --> 01:06:43,721
They took Etta, Hanna,
maybe six, seven others, I don't know.

834
01:06:43,833 --> 01:06:46,199
They've never come
during the day before.

835
01:06:46,302 --> 01:06:48,736
They knew I wouldn't be
expecting them until tonight.

836
01:06:48,838 --> 01:06:50,135
They played me.

837
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:51,763
- What?
- Nothing.

838
01:06:52,441 --> 01:06:54,966
Otis, they took Maddie.

839
01:07:00,082 --> 01:07:02,050
Those coyotes are strong.

840
01:07:04,453 --> 01:07:05,613
What?

841
01:07:05,721 --> 01:07:08,155
The coyotes, they're strong.

842
01:07:09,225 --> 01:07:12,956
I was just wondering
what a stronger man might do.

843
01:07:33,282 --> 01:07:35,978
- You'll look after things?
- Be proud to.

844
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:38,987
I'll be back.

845
01:07:54,503 --> 01:07:57,370
- I'm going, too.
- No, Pip, stay here.

846
01:07:57,473 --> 01:07:59,941
You can't do this alone.
They could kill you.

847
01:08:00,042 --> 01:08:02,033
Yeah, I guess they could.

848
01:08:42,518 --> 01:08:45,919
It's nice that you ladies
could join us this evening.

849
01:08:46,255 --> 01:08:50,351
Thank you for being so patient.
We prefer dining at night.

850
01:08:56,565 --> 01:08:58,760
You're a wonderful species.

851
01:08:59,201 --> 01:09:03,604
I love chicken.
My favorite part is the skin.

852
01:09:03,706 --> 01:09:05,469
You're a big meanie.

853
01:09:05,574 --> 01:09:07,667
- What?
- You're a meaner.

854
01:09:07,776 --> 01:09:11,803
Meaner, meaner.
Meaners got to eat, too.

855
01:09:11,914 --> 01:09:13,506
Leave her alone.

856
01:09:14,383 --> 01:09:15,714
This one's mine.

857
01:09:15,818 --> 01:09:18,616
Cook her while I have the little one
for an appetizer.

858
01:09:18,721 --> 01:09:21,121
You know, because I'm a meaner.

859
01:09:26,996 --> 01:09:28,987
Put the chick down, Dag.

860
01:09:34,503 --> 01:09:36,471
- Otis!
- Oaty!

861
01:09:38,140 --> 01:09:41,405
We suddenly got a burst of courage,
did we?

862
01:09:41,510 --> 01:09:42,977
Okay. All right.

863
01:09:43,078 --> 01:09:46,605
Well, first, what I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna take that chick from you.

864
01:09:46,715 --> 01:09:49,479
Then, while you're picking yourself
up off the ground,

865
01:09:49,585 --> 01:09:52,952
I'm gonna gather up the hens
and I'm gonna leave.

866
01:09:53,055 --> 01:09:56,183
And exactly how do you propose
you're going to do that?

867
01:10:04,333 --> 01:10:05,698
Kill him!

868
01:10:05,801 --> 01:10:08,998
<i>Well, I know what's right</i>

869
01:10:10,072 --> 01:10:13,166
<i>I got just one life</i>

870
01:10:14,343 --> 01:10:18,712
<i>In a world that keeps on</i>
<i>pushing me around</i>

871
01:10:18,814 --> 01:10:21,942
<i>But I'll stand my ground</i>

872
01:10:22,985 --> 01:10:26,216
<i>And I won't back down</i>

873
01:10:27,790 --> 01:10:30,588
<i>Hey, baby</i>

874
01:10:32,394 --> 01:10:34,828
<i>There ain't no easy way out</i>

875
01:10:36,365 --> 01:10:38,560
<i>Hey</i>

876
01:10:38,667 --> 01:10:43,331
<i>I will stand my ground</i>

877
01:10:44,273 --> 01:10:47,731
<i>And I won't back down</i>

878
01:10:48,210 --> 01:10:50,144
Oh, you like that, yeah?

879
01:11:00,990 --> 01:11:03,959
That should do. That should do.

880
01:11:06,262 --> 01:11:09,595
Well, look at the hero.

881
01:11:10,499 --> 01:11:13,332
You thought you could come
into my den?

882
01:11:14,270 --> 01:11:17,330
Now, why don't you lay there and watch

883
01:11:17,439 --> 01:11:20,067
while we eat your friends?

884
01:11:33,455 --> 01:11:35,082
What's this?

885
01:11:36,592 --> 01:11:39,561
A strong man stands up for himself.

886
01:11:40,996 --> 01:11:44,193
A stronger man stands up for others.

887
01:11:46,568 --> 01:11:48,331
This should be fun.

888
01:11:57,646 --> 01:11:59,443
I smell fear.

889
01:12:00,015 --> 01:12:02,415
Shoot! I told you they can smell it!

890
01:12:02,518 --> 01:12:04,179
They can smell it?

891
01:12:05,454 --> 01:12:08,287
Oh, yeah, I have it. I have a lot of it.

892
01:12:08,390 --> 01:12:10,950
Just stick near me, guys,
and you'll be all right.

893
01:12:11,060 --> 01:12:13,654
Yeah, I'll watch your juicy back.

894
01:12:14,096 --> 01:12:15,654
I mean, your regular back.

895
01:12:17,866 --> 01:12:19,697
- Hey!
- Sorry, man.

896
01:12:19,802 --> 01:12:22,236
They're just pellets. I'm nervous.

897
01:12:23,205 --> 01:12:24,832
That's your army?

898
01:12:30,446 --> 01:12:34,348
Something tells me you may want
to take a couple steps back.

899
01:12:40,289 --> 01:12:41,483
Here we come!

900
01:12:41,590 --> 01:12:42,955
- Here comes trou...
- Ble!

901
01:12:43,058 --> 01:12:44,320
- Trou...
- Ble!

902
01:12:44,426 --> 01:12:45,893
- Trou...
- Ble!

903
01:12:58,140 --> 01:12:59,471
Pip, talk me into it. Talk me into it.

904
01:12:59,575 --> 01:13:01,941
Flip the lid a little bit.
You're mad! You're a pig!

905
01:13:02,044 --> 01:13:04,137
- You're mad!
- Let's do this!

906
01:13:14,957 --> 01:13:18,654
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna go right in your ear!

907
01:13:20,095 --> 01:13:23,622
There's a mouse in my ear!
There's a mouse in my ear!

908
01:13:25,067 --> 01:13:27,160
Oh, yeah. Step on it, baby!

909
01:13:32,941 --> 01:13:36,809
All right, come on.
Give me your best shot.

910
01:13:36,912 --> 01:13:40,006
Oh, sorry. Here. You know what?
Let me give you a hand.

911
01:13:40,115 --> 01:13:43,278
Yeah, give him the puncher!
Smack him!

912
01:14:11,079 --> 01:14:13,912
Well, well, whatever will I do?

913
01:14:19,054 --> 01:14:22,490
Oh, don't worry,
I got something special for you.

914
01:14:42,010 --> 01:14:43,978
I just love that little guy.

915
01:14:44,079 --> 01:14:45,512
Come on, hurry.

916
01:14:50,752 --> 01:14:52,049
- No!
- Hi!

917
01:14:55,123 --> 01:14:57,023
It tastes like chicken!

918
01:14:57,726 --> 01:14:58,852
Chicken!

919
01:14:58,961 --> 01:15:00,622
Chick, chick, chickity-chick, chicken!

920
01:15:00,729 --> 01:15:03,892
Come here,
you furry, four-legged chickens!

921
01:15:07,736 --> 01:15:09,431
Take it easy, man.

922
01:15:09,538 --> 01:15:12,473
Come on, what you got going?
There's nothing there.

923
01:15:21,917 --> 01:15:23,248
Hey, Otis, look out!

924
01:15:23,352 --> 01:15:25,343
- Behind you!
- Watch out!

925
01:15:28,423 --> 01:15:30,015
Watch out!

926
01:15:34,930 --> 01:15:36,488
Look behind you.

927
01:15:43,038 --> 01:15:44,437
Remember me?

928
01:15:44,973 --> 01:15:46,463
I'm Ben's kid.

929
01:15:59,888 --> 01:16:02,686
Never come back!

930
01:16:05,694 --> 01:16:08,595
- Pip?
- I'd have to go with the iron, man.

931
01:16:25,881 --> 01:16:27,815
Then I said
I was gonna hit him with a stick.

932
01:16:27,916 --> 01:16:30,510
We know. We know.
I heard you say that.

933
01:16:30,852 --> 01:16:32,285
Quite a night, huh?

934
01:16:32,387 --> 01:16:34,855
We took down the coyotes,
Peck learned to crow,

935
01:16:34,957 --> 01:16:36,254
and by the time we get back,

936
01:16:36,358 --> 01:16:38,553
we'll have a new member
of the barnyard running around.

937
01:16:39,328 --> 01:16:42,161
Daisy. She like went into labor
after you left.

938
01:16:43,932 --> 01:16:45,991
- Daisy's...
- She's having her baby, dude.

939
01:16:46,101 --> 01:16:47,500
What you think was gonna happen?

940
01:16:47,603 --> 01:16:49,434
She would just keep getting
bigger or something?

941
01:16:49,538 --> 01:16:52,371
- Is she all right? We've gotta get back.
- Yeah.

942
01:16:52,474 --> 01:16:54,908
Doubtful we'll make it
back in time walking.

943
01:16:55,010 --> 01:16:57,308
I'm sure she's gonna be all right, Otis.

944
01:16:57,412 --> 01:17:00,006
Miles, I've got to be there.

945
01:17:05,587 --> 01:17:08,021
Please remember, mister,
that I am a lady.

946
01:17:08,123 --> 01:17:11,320
When you are with me,
your eyes are on me, not her.

947
01:17:15,664 --> 01:17:18,326
We can call and tell them
where to pick them up.

948
01:17:39,287 --> 01:17:40,345
Car!

949
01:17:44,226 --> 01:17:46,251
Righteous!

950
01:18:02,310 --> 01:18:03,572
Duke, what's happening?

951
01:18:03,679 --> 01:18:07,877
Otis, come on. You know, I think...
I'm pretty sure... Yeah, it's time.

952
01:18:15,891 --> 01:18:16,949
Boy.

953
01:18:43,852 --> 01:18:47,049
Otis, I was so worried.

954
01:18:47,155 --> 01:18:50,215
Worried about what?
I so had that covered.

955
01:18:51,093 --> 01:18:52,856
It's okay, I'm here.

956
01:18:55,564 --> 01:18:58,328
And I'm here for you, too.

957
01:19:00,402 --> 01:19:03,929
Okay, girl, you're doing fine.
Now, just breathe.

958
01:19:35,570 --> 01:19:37,504
Man, that looks like it hurts.

959
01:19:37,606 --> 01:19:40,234
Oh, that's very profound, Insight-Man.

960
01:19:40,342 --> 01:19:42,435
Well, excuse me for being a pig.

961
01:19:42,544 --> 01:19:44,535
How come nothing's happened yet?

962
01:19:44,646 --> 01:19:46,910
She's gonna be all right, though, huh?

963
01:19:47,015 --> 01:19:50,178
Yeah, like, like...
What if it gets stuck or something?

964
01:19:50,285 --> 01:19:54,551
What? You mean like stuck halfway,
so she'd be a cow and a half?

965
01:19:54,656 --> 01:19:56,556
I didn't say "cow and a half."

966
01:19:56,658 --> 01:19:58,216
Yes, you did. You just did.

967
01:19:58,326 --> 01:20:02,353
- Hey, Duke, did I say "Cow and a half"?
- I'm not doing this.

968
01:20:02,697 --> 01:20:04,096
No, look.

969
01:20:09,738 --> 01:20:12,332
It's a beautiful little boy.

970
01:20:15,777 --> 01:20:17,039
Go ahead.

971
01:20:24,619 --> 01:20:26,086
He's perfect.

972
01:20:27,422 --> 01:20:29,720
What are you gonna name him?

973
01:20:30,292 --> 01:20:32,886
I was thinking I kind of like

974
01:20:34,663 --> 01:20:35,755
Ben.

975
01:20:41,937 --> 01:20:43,905
Oh, I think that's just great.

976
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:46,940
Hey, there, little Ben.

977
01:20:49,644 --> 01:20:52,943
Hey, there, little buddy. Look at you.

978
01:20:54,149 --> 01:20:56,117
Look at my little buddy.

979
01:20:57,219 --> 01:20:58,584
Here you go.

980
01:21:10,866 --> 01:21:12,390
Hey, Otis, we were all talking,

981
01:21:12,500 --> 01:21:15,128
and we know you may have
other plans, we understand that,

982
01:21:15,237 --> 01:21:18,263
but we really, really appreciate
what you did around here.

983
01:21:18,373 --> 01:21:20,500
And, well, we were wondering,
I don't know,

984
01:21:20,609 --> 01:21:23,271
if maybe you planned
on staying around a little longer?

985
01:21:23,378 --> 01:21:25,869
<i>Freedom is a song</i>

986
01:21:26,014 --> 01:21:27,777
<i>Freedom is a spirit</i>

987
01:21:28,950 --> 01:21:31,646
<i>To take another's hand</i>

988
01:21:33,121 --> 01:21:34,816
I'll just say this,

989
01:21:34,923 --> 01:21:36,754
as long as I'm still kicking,

990
01:21:36,858 --> 01:21:41,022
no animal will be harmed
inside that fence.

991
01:21:48,036 --> 01:21:49,298
High paw!

992
01:21:50,639 --> 01:21:52,163
Hey, all right.

993
01:21:57,445 --> 01:21:59,936
<i>Freedom is a song</i>

994
01:22:00,448 --> 01:22:02,939
<i>Freedom is a spirit</i>

995
01:22:03,084 --> 01:22:05,644
<i>For people who are strong</i>

996
01:22:06,054 --> 01:22:08,386
<i>Freedom is a spirit</i>

997
01:22:08,990 --> 01:22:11,550
<i>Freedom is a land</i>

998
01:22:11,960 --> 01:22:14,554
<i>Freedom is the courage</i>

999
01:22:14,663 --> 01:22:16,995
<i>To take another's hand</i>

1000
01:22:39,452 --> 01:22:42,853
I, Nora Beady, am a precious object

1001
01:22:42,955 --> 01:22:45,549
and shall treat myself as such.

1002
01:22:48,594 --> 01:22:52,291
Gosh, I wonder why...
I forgot to use conditioner or...
