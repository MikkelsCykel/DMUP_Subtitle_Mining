1
00:00:21,246 --> 00:00:23,867
So? Tell me about last night.

2
00:00:23,998 --> 00:00:27,201
Are you kidding me?
Are you pulling my leg?

3
00:00:27,335 --> 00:00:30,087
- So?
- So tits out to here.

4
00:00:30,463 --> 00:00:34,081
- Some 20 years old.
- You must be fooling. You devil.

5
00:00:34,217 --> 00:00:36,293
You think she hadn't gone the route?

6
00:00:36,427 --> 00:00:40,721
- She knew the route, did she?
- Are you kidding? She wrote the route.

7
00:00:40,848 --> 00:00:43,968
- So where am I?
- Probably at the Pancake House.

8
00:00:45,436 --> 00:00:50,597
I'm over at the Pancake House, and this
chick walks over to the cash register.

9
00:00:50,733 --> 00:00:55,312
19 or 20 years old.
She wants to buy a pack of Viceroys.

10
00:00:55,446 --> 00:01:01,864
She gets the smokes and says
she forgot her purse up in her room.

11
00:01:01,995 --> 00:01:04,283
- Was she a pro?
- At that age?

12
00:01:04,414 --> 00:01:05,872
At this point, we don't know.

13
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:09,948
So we sit down and get coffee
and she says:

14
00:01:10,086 --> 00:01:13,040
"Come up to my room
and I'll pay you back for the smokes."

15
00:01:13,172 --> 00:01:19,045
- You're shitting me. Was she a pro?
- At this point, we don't know.

16
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:23,549
She says, "sit down, you want a drink?"
I say, "what have you got?" "Bourbon."

17
00:01:23,683 --> 00:01:25,592
Then what shot does she pull?

18
00:01:25,727 --> 00:01:30,969
A) she says:
"I think I'll take a shower".

19
00:01:31,107 --> 00:01:35,568
- And B) she says: "Then let's fuck."
- She said that?

20
00:01:35,695 --> 00:01:38,862
- Was she a pro?
- At this point, we don't know.

21
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:44,281
So I say: "I'll join you in the shower,
if you have no objections".

22
00:01:44,412 --> 00:01:51,494
So in we go, and does she have a body?
Are you kidding me? The tits. The legs.

23
00:01:51,628 --> 00:01:54,379
Are you fucking fooling me?
The ass on this broad.

24
00:01:54,505 --> 00:01:57,957
- Young ass?
- Well, young broad, young ass.

25
00:01:58,092 --> 00:02:02,920
So we get out and towel each other off
in his and her full glory.

26
00:02:03,056 --> 00:02:06,259
While we're toweling off,
I flick the towel at her ...

27
00:02:06,392 --> 00:02:11,303
and by accident, I hit her on the ass,
and we got this big red mark.

28
00:02:11,606 --> 00:02:15,141
I'm all sorry and so forth,
but what does this broad do -

29
00:02:15,276 --> 00:02:19,772
- but let out a squeal of pleasure
that would fucking kill a horse.

30
00:02:19,906 --> 00:02:23,820
What the hell, I'm liberal,
so I heave a chair at her.

31
00:02:23,952 --> 00:02:27,036
- Draw blood?
- Not yet. But what does she say?

32
00:02:27,163 --> 00:02:31,161
"Wait a minute!" She pulls out
a suitcase from under the bed -

33
00:02:31,292 --> 00:02:34,708
- with a World War II flak suit.

34
00:02:34,837 --> 00:02:38,088
Zip, zip, she gets into the flak suit,
we get down on the bed.

35
00:02:38,216 --> 00:02:40,125
- What are you doing?
- Fucking!

36
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:44,968
- But she's in a flak suit.
- She leaves the zipper open.

37
00:02:45,139 --> 00:02:48,306
But the shot is,
every thirty seconds or so, -

38
00:02:48,434 --> 00:02:52,384
- she wants me to go "BOOM"
at the top of my lungs.

39
00:02:52,522 --> 00:02:56,733
So we're humping and pumping,
and every once in a while, I go "boom".

40
00:02:56,859 --> 00:03:01,023
In the middle of everything,
she turns on a little tape recorder.

41
00:03:01,155 --> 00:03:07,953
I don't know what the shot is.
All of a sudden I hear:

42
00:03:10,331 --> 00:03:13,783
I'm pumping away, the tape recorder
is making airplane noises.

43
00:03:13,918 --> 00:03:18,331
Every once in a while, I go "boom",
and the broad starts going crazy.

44
00:03:18,464 --> 00:03:20,587
She's moaning and groaning -

45
00:03:20,717 --> 00:03:23,718
- and screaming,
"Red Dog One to Red Dog Squadron".

46
00:03:23,845 --> 00:03:29,183
Suddenly, she screams, "Wait!"
and pulls out a five-gallon jerry-can.

47
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:33,520
It's full of gasoline.
She splashes it over the walls -

48
00:03:33,646 --> 00:03:38,723
- pulls out a zippo and "whoosh",
the room goes up in flames.

49
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:42,525
So the tape recorder is going ...
the room is full of smoke ...

50
00:03:42,655 --> 00:03:48,859
- and the broad screams,
"Do it now, for the love of Christ!"

51
00:03:55,585 --> 00:04:02,750
So I look at the broad,
and I figure, fuck this nonsense.

52
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:06,923
I struggle into my shorts,
make it to the elevator.

53
00:04:08,097 --> 00:04:10,137
The place is filled with smoke.

54
00:04:10,266 --> 00:04:13,801
The elevator arrives,
and the hall is filled with firemen.

55
00:04:13,978 --> 00:04:19,139
- Those firemen make out like bandits.
- Nobody does it normally anymore.

56
00:04:19,275 --> 00:04:22,691
These young broads don't know
what the fuck they want.

57
00:04:22,946 --> 00:04:27,857
- You think she was a pro?
- A pro, Dan?

58
00:04:28,868 --> 00:04:34,823
A pro is how you think of yourself.
See my point?

59
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:38,877
Come on you scumbags, last inning.

60
00:04:43,299 --> 00:04:46,917
- Where, where?
- Right there.

61
00:04:47,679 --> 00:04:51,427
Here comes Debbie's boss.
He looks good, let's see if he can hit.

62
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,270
Out!

63
00:05:07,657 --> 00:05:09,116
No stick.

64
00:05:09,242 --> 00:05:12,741
The second baseman has a nice ass.

65
00:05:13,121 --> 00:05:16,988
I refuse to go out with a man,
whose ass is smaller than mine.

66
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:19,450
Your dates will be pretty scarce.

67
00:05:32,807 --> 00:05:34,930
Nice catch, Danny.

68
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:43,190
I'm making a beer run. Anybody?

69
00:05:47,113 --> 00:05:52,783
- Go get him.
- It's the guy with the cute ass.

70
00:06:04,422 --> 00:06:07,174
Let me help you.

71
00:06:14,057 --> 00:06:17,675
- Anytime I can give you a hand ...
- I'm finished. Give yourself a hand.

72
00:06:58,184 --> 00:07:02,312
Mother's is giving a party tonight.
Winners and losers.

73
00:07:02,438 --> 00:07:06,899
- Good game, Mr Carlson.
- I don't want to hear about it now.

74
00:07:08,444 --> 00:07:12,738
- Steve, are you going to Mother's?
- I doubt it.

75
00:07:14,158 --> 00:07:19,235
I've been meaning to mention
that it's stupid to fuck your boss.

76
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:23,452
It's a damn good way to lose your job.

77
00:07:36,598 --> 00:07:40,346
- Guess who was here last night.
- Not the redhead.

78
00:07:40,476 --> 00:07:46,396
- She was here? What did she say?
- Ask Bernie, he took her home.

79
00:07:47,483 --> 00:07:52,478
- Redheads lack pigmentation.
- They're almost albino.

80
00:07:52,614 --> 00:07:57,074
You bang albino?
Well, I have and they're nuts.

81
00:07:57,327 --> 00:08:01,241
Welcome to Mother's, ladies.
We're honoured, come on.

82
00:08:04,792 --> 00:08:08,457
- Where are the guys from your team?
- Sulking.

83
00:08:08,588 --> 00:08:10,995
First round is on Mother.

84
00:08:11,758 --> 00:08:14,213
I'll be back in a minute.

85
00:08:14,969 --> 00:08:18,421
They'll come at me tomorrow
like savages.

86
00:08:18,556 --> 00:08:21,925
- Marauding beasts bent on destruction.
- Stop it.

87
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:26,805
Deborah, you work in advertising.
It is a civilized business.

88
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:31,518
- I work with monsters.
- You're talking about five-year-olds.

89
00:08:31,653 --> 00:08:36,361
And my job is to break their spirit.
That's what kindergarten is about.

90
00:08:36,491 --> 00:08:42,743
The Germans invented it. Think about it.
God, Pat's going in for the kill.

91
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:46,826
That's a nice turn.

92
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,248
- Coy.
- With just a hint of giddiness.

93
00:08:49,379 --> 00:08:55,797
Her big move will come at any moment.
The combination hair flip with a giggle.

94
00:08:55,927 --> 00:09:00,505
There's a 3.2 degree difficulty.
Let's see if she can pull it off.

95
00:09:08,523 --> 00:09:10,765
9.0!

96
00:09:13,403 --> 00:09:18,195
Tell me that getting those
advertising girls here wasn't perfect.

97
00:09:18,283 --> 00:09:20,192
Pick a pair.

98
00:09:20,285 --> 00:09:22,822
Like shooting fish in a barrel.

99
00:09:24,163 --> 00:09:28,624
- We do pretty well for ourselves.
- We? Did you say "we"?

100
00:09:28,751 --> 00:09:32,583
You've got balls.
I do the work, you take the credit.

101
00:09:32,714 --> 00:09:35,287
You know what your problem is?
Your face.

102
00:09:35,425 --> 00:09:40,799
Come on, you're too good-looking.
Girls go out with you and get nervous.

103
00:09:40,972 --> 00:09:43,214
They feel dumpy,
they don't want to compete.

104
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:49,304
They want a guy like ... like me.
A guy who'll make them look good.

105
00:09:49,439 --> 00:09:53,436
- A basic Neanderthal type.
- The swarthy type. A man's man.

106
00:09:53,568 --> 00:09:57,186
- The kind of guy who's ...
- Oozing testosterone?

107
00:09:57,322 --> 00:10:00,192
A young woman today
wants a little bulk in her diet.

108
00:10:00,325 --> 00:10:03,361
A big guy who sweats.

109
00:10:03,494 --> 00:10:07,907
Best thing that could happen to you
is an industrial accident.

110
00:10:14,005 --> 00:10:18,881
- You're not leaving, are you?
- No, we're walking in backwards.

111
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:21,762
- I'm Debbie.
- Hi ... Dan.

112
00:10:23,139 --> 00:10:28,560
This is Joan, my roommate.
She specializes in unsolicited attacks.

113
00:10:28,686 --> 00:10:34,392
We're going to Irving's.
A 4 o'clock dive for us Kamikaze pilots.

114
00:10:34,692 --> 00:10:38,393
I've been bombed there
a couple of times myself.

115
00:10:38,529 --> 00:10:40,937
Quit while you're ahead.

116
00:10:49,999 --> 00:10:55,623
I couldn't help noticing you
and noticing you noticing me.

117
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:57,748
There was a clock over your head.

118
00:11:56,649 --> 00:11:59,816
I'll bet these have been put
to a lot of use.

119
00:11:59,944 --> 00:12:04,820
Oh, they work.
Good, I just got them today.

120
00:13:11,432 --> 00:13:15,560
- You don't have to run off.
- Yes, I do.

121
00:13:15,687 --> 00:13:22,140
It's been a slice of heaven, I just
have to go home. It's a habit of mine.

122
00:13:24,028 --> 00:13:27,812
- I can turn on a light.
- No, that's alright.

123
00:13:31,077 --> 00:13:33,449
Bye.

124
00:13:38,376 --> 00:13:41,911
- I can drive you home.
- No, thanks.

125
00:13:42,171 --> 00:13:46,252
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

126
00:13:57,270 --> 00:14:03,059
- What are you doing out here?
- I have this guy in my room. A big guy.

127
00:14:03,401 --> 00:14:05,192
Real drunk. Real cute.

128
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:08,819
This guy is huge.

129
00:14:10,158 --> 00:14:15,496
He's lying face down on the bed
like a beached whale. You have to see.

130
00:14:16,289 --> 00:14:19,159
He's dead drunk.
He's out like a light.

131
00:14:22,587 --> 00:14:25,872
It would take a crane to get him out.

132
00:14:31,929 --> 00:14:36,805
- Should I tell you?
- Did you have a nice evening?

133
00:14:37,018 --> 00:14:42,439
- Yes, and then I crawled away in shame.
- Aren't we a couple of sluts?

134
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:49,108
- I slept with him on the first date.
- It wasn't even a date.

135
00:14:52,492 --> 00:14:57,652
I could not help myself
because he's so gorgeous.

136
00:14:57,789 --> 00:15:01,786
But can he type?

137
00:15:04,921 --> 00:15:08,337
I guess you'll have the bed to yourself.

138
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:12,170
She's got this fur-lined bed.

139
00:15:12,303 --> 00:15:14,973
- What kind of fur?
- I don't know, but it's fur.

140
00:15:15,098 --> 00:15:20,554
The static electricity from it
is sending sparks right to my nuts.

141
00:15:21,062 --> 00:15:24,396
I felt like a human jumper cable.

142
00:15:28,111 --> 00:15:30,981
Did you score last night?

143
00:15:31,906 --> 00:15:34,990
Double headphone deal?

144
00:15:36,828 --> 00:15:40,161
That chick, was she hot?

145
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:45,454
- She was fun.
- Fun?

146
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:50,001
She was fun?

147
00:15:52,844 --> 00:15:54,836
Have you ever done it in a plane?

148
00:15:54,971 --> 00:16:01,175
Yeah. I once nailed two stewardesses
in a 747 at 35,000 feet.

149
00:16:04,105 --> 00:16:06,477
It was "fun".

150
00:16:06,608 --> 00:16:10,023
I had a "fun" time.

151
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:19,984
Haven't ordered silverware in 6 months.
Your customers eat with their toes?

152
00:16:20,121 --> 00:16:22,493
I'll throw in the steak markers.

153
00:16:22,624 --> 00:16:25,459
If some kid throws up on them,
they're okay.

154
00:16:25,585 --> 00:16:30,792
- Push the French fries.
- The French fries are fabulous.

155
00:16:43,603 --> 00:16:46,604
- Hello?
- Hello?

156
00:16:49,192 --> 00:16:52,892
- Who's this?
- It's Dan. Dan Martin.

157
00:16:53,029 --> 00:16:55,781
From last night.

158
00:16:56,574 --> 00:16:59,528
I want to talk to you about last night.

159
00:16:59,661 --> 00:17:03,160
That's what I'm calling about.

160
00:17:03,289 --> 00:17:08,532
I was pretty drunk last night.
Did anything happen?

161
00:17:08,836 --> 00:17:11,790
No, absolutely nothing.
Want to do it again?

162
00:17:11,923 --> 00:17:16,300
- I mean, want to meet for a drink?
- I'm awfully sorry.

163
00:17:16,427 --> 00:17:19,001
We called at the same time. It's a sign.

164
00:17:19,138 --> 00:17:22,922
It was a fluke, just like last night.

165
00:17:25,561 --> 00:17:29,476
Could you send up two pages
of Bodini Bold press?

166
00:17:29,607 --> 00:17:33,984
- Could you bring this to Room E?
- Is that your boss?

167
00:17:34,654 --> 00:17:36,812
Meet me at Mother's at 6 o'clock.

168
00:17:36,948 --> 00:17:40,032
Don't take me for granted,
I'll only wait for 4 or 5 hours.

169
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:43,575
No, I won't need any.

170
00:17:46,249 --> 00:17:48,325
The broad from last night?

171
00:17:48,459 --> 00:17:52,409
I pick up the phone
and she's on the line.

172
00:17:52,505 --> 00:17:54,711
Pull this and it plays "Jingle Bells".

173
00:17:57,051 --> 00:18:00,716
- I'm sorry about last night.
- That's okay.

174
00:18:00,847 --> 00:18:06,221
That happens when you take life too
seriously. What did you do last night?

175
00:18:06,436 --> 00:18:09,721
Went home and took some lithium. You?

176
00:18:11,608 --> 00:18:15,142
Are you busy for lunch?
A nice long one in my apartment.

177
00:18:15,236 --> 00:18:19,945
- I can't. This is due tonight.
- Tomorrow.

178
00:18:25,246 --> 00:18:29,873
They're fine. The first week
they're too scared to cause trouble.

179
00:18:31,044 --> 00:18:34,876
Lisa, honey, I'm on the telephone.

180
00:18:35,632 --> 00:18:41,752
Did the baseball player call you?
You shouldn't be wandering the halls.

181
00:18:43,765 --> 00:18:46,884
I will go with you
if you need a chaperone.

182
00:18:47,018 --> 00:18:50,932
I need to pick up some art supplies.
Meet me at Horder's.

183
00:18:51,064 --> 00:18:53,815
I will buy you
a Mickey Mouse pencil-holder.

184
00:18:58,947 --> 00:19:03,443
I really have to go.
I'll meet you at five.

185
00:19:04,118 --> 00:19:06,740
It's okay, honey.

186
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:15,915
Everybody wets their pants,
and nobody has to know about it.

187
00:19:16,464 --> 00:19:18,172
What size do you wear?

188
00:19:18,216 --> 00:19:24,254
Six-X? I just happen to have
an extra pair in my locker.

189
00:19:25,723 --> 00:19:29,507
They have pictures of Wonder Woman
all over them.

190
00:19:31,229 --> 00:19:34,645
- Bernie, they're here.
- I guess I get the dog.

191
00:19:37,026 --> 00:19:39,980
Come on, sit down. Here you go.

192
00:19:40,113 --> 00:19:43,363
Bernie, this is Debbie.
Debbie, this is Bernie.

193
00:19:44,909 --> 00:19:50,283
You're a very attractive woman.
Anyone tell you that before?

194
00:19:51,249 --> 00:19:54,914
Bernie, this is ...

195
00:19:56,921 --> 00:19:59,293
Joan.

196
00:19:59,424 --> 00:20:05,177
- That's a nice name. Want a drink?
- No, I don't want anything.

197
00:20:05,305 --> 00:20:09,219
- I have to go.
- Wait.

198
00:20:11,728 --> 00:20:16,271
What do you do? For a living?

199
00:20:16,649 --> 00:20:21,857
- I'm a neurosurgeon. You?
- I'm a professional boxer.

200
00:20:21,988 --> 00:20:25,986
Know much about fighting?
I'm world heavyweight champion .

201
00:20:26,117 --> 00:20:30,826
- Nice to meet you, Champ.
- Wait. One drink won't hurt.

202
00:20:30,955 --> 00:20:33,742
I have something better to do.

203
00:20:34,292 --> 00:20:37,743
I'll meet you at the steam bath
tomorrow at six.

204
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:43,045
Nice meeting you.

205
00:20:44,969 --> 00:20:50,723
Interesting broad. Did she develop
her personality in a car crash?

206
00:20:50,975 --> 00:20:54,510
She's nice once you get to know her.

207
00:20:57,982 --> 00:21:02,810
- Are you going to sit down?
- Shoot, no.

208
00:21:02,946 --> 00:21:06,895
I'm going to let you do
what you got to do.

209
00:21:07,033 --> 00:21:11,196
Don't worry about me. I'll go home.
Make a little macaroni and cheese.

210
00:21:11,621 --> 00:21:14,373
Seal the windows and turn on the gas.

211
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:18,407
I'll see you tomorrow.

212
00:21:23,132 --> 00:21:25,042
Fashionably late.

213
00:21:26,302 --> 00:21:31,509
I just thought you might be
fool enough to sit here until midnight.

214
00:21:35,853 --> 00:21:38,142
Don't look at me like the cat
who just ate the canary -

215
00:21:38,272 --> 00:21:42,104
- because this is as far
as this goes tonight.

216
00:21:49,075 --> 00:21:54,662
- Are you cold? Do you want a T-shirt?
- I don't need anything.

217
00:21:56,416 --> 00:22:00,330
Are you okay? I mean, did you ...

218
00:22:00,545 --> 00:22:04,673
Yeah ... couldn't you tell?

219
00:22:07,635 --> 00:22:11,550
I mean, girls sometimes ...

220
00:22:11,681 --> 00:22:14,598
I mean, guys ... you know.

221
00:22:16,269 --> 00:22:19,887
We just keep you in the dark
to make you work harder.

222
00:22:20,023 --> 00:22:23,855
- You're full of secrets.
- It's a conspiracy.

223
00:22:27,697 --> 00:22:29,820
You want to know something else?

224
00:22:29,949 --> 00:22:34,611
We went out with older guys in
high school to make you jealous.

225
00:22:34,746 --> 00:22:38,695
I knew that, too. Come on, what else?

226
00:22:40,501 --> 00:22:46,374
Our girlfriends ...
They're really lesbian lovers.

227
00:22:46,549 --> 00:22:52,255
- You must hate us as a race. Don't you?
- Yes, we do.

228
00:22:54,766 --> 00:22:58,135
- Tell me one.
- What? A secret?

229
00:22:58,269 --> 00:23:02,598
I don't have any secrets.
What you see is what you get.

230
00:23:08,488 --> 00:23:10,895
You going home?

231
00:23:12,158 --> 00:23:15,859
I was stretching.
Do you want me to go home?

232
00:23:16,663 --> 00:23:19,617
No, I ... Do you want to?

233
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:25,707
Do you want me to stay?
I don't know if it's such a good idea.

234
00:23:25,838 --> 00:23:29,338
It doesn't mean anything if you stay.

235
00:23:32,345 --> 00:23:36,177
I'd like you to stay ... if you want to.

236
00:23:44,399 --> 00:23:48,231
All right. I'll stay.

237
00:23:48,361 --> 00:23:53,700
I am getting sick and tired
of you making fun of me.

238
00:25:10,777 --> 00:25:13,018
What?

239
00:25:13,363 --> 00:25:15,355
I like this place.

240
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:19,322
"Place". Come on, this is a joint.

241
00:25:20,203 --> 00:25:26,075
Look at the fixtures in here. You can't
get this kind of Formica anymore.

242
00:25:26,209 --> 00:25:28,534
Everything in here is art deco.

243
00:25:29,754 --> 00:25:33,040
Yeah, kind of.

244
00:25:34,384 --> 00:25:38,333
- Yo, Gus. How about a refill?
- Yo, Dan. You know where the coffee is.

245
00:25:38,471 --> 00:25:43,631
- I'm trying to impress my date.
- You shouldn't have brought her here.

246
00:25:43,768 --> 00:25:48,845
Is this the way you talk to all
your customers? All three of them?

247
00:25:54,445 --> 00:25:57,612
I like this joint.

248
00:26:15,133 --> 00:26:21,171
Remember last night in bed?
You wanted to know something about me.

249
00:26:23,558 --> 00:26:26,843
I want to own my own restaurant.

250
00:26:28,354 --> 00:26:33,597
- Just a real first class joint.
- "Danny's".

251
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:38,819
Who am I kidding?
I'll never have that kind of money.

252
00:26:38,948 --> 00:26:44,322
- It all falls apart right there.
- You have to get a liquor license.

253
00:26:44,454 --> 00:26:48,072
- It's an outrage.
- It's a goddam scandal.

254
00:26:48,166 --> 00:26:54,500
- Washed up at 24. It's tragic.
- You know what? You're alright.

255
00:27:09,437 --> 00:27:12,189
If you answer it, I'll kill you.

256
00:27:19,447 --> 00:27:23,908
- Where have you been?
- I got hung up.

257
00:27:24,494 --> 00:27:27,578
- Steve called.
- What did he say?

258
00:27:27,705 --> 00:27:33,126
- He said where the hell were you?
- What did you tell him?

259
00:27:34,253 --> 00:27:39,710
That you have to wait 24 hours before
you file a missing person's report.

260
00:27:39,801 --> 00:27:43,170
I thought you were in somebody's trunk.

261
00:27:48,226 --> 00:27:54,430
- I was with Danny.
- I waited for you at the steam bath.

262
00:27:54,857 --> 00:27:59,934
Just sweating my ass of with some
fat women from the old country -

263
00:28:00,029 --> 00:28:02,318
- who don't speak any English.

264
00:28:02,448 --> 00:28:05,817
- Was I supposed to talk to myself?
- I'm sorry.

265
00:28:08,371 --> 00:28:11,906
It's the same old thing.

266
00:28:12,333 --> 00:28:17,873
I bet in high school, you just dropped
your friends whenever some guy called.

267
00:28:18,006 --> 00:28:21,754
- Who didn't?
- I didn't.

268
00:28:21,884 --> 00:28:24,755
But I didn't have a whole lot of dates.

269
00:28:25,013 --> 00:28:28,216
- Don't pull that.
- It's not fair.

270
00:28:28,349 --> 00:28:33,142
We've stayed friends, because we don't
take each other for granted.

271
00:28:34,731 --> 00:28:38,349
I'm sorry. I got hurt.

272
00:28:39,527 --> 00:28:42,943
I must be a little too sensitive.

273
00:28:44,449 --> 00:28:47,818
- What's for breakfast?
- Egg McMuffin on Broadway.

274
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:58,118
- He was supposed to come today.
- He came a day earlier.

275
00:28:58,254 --> 00:29:02,038
You must expect that, Danny.
This is a business.

276
00:29:02,175 --> 00:29:06,469
You don't do what you did.
I'd like to spend a day with my kid.

277
00:29:06,596 --> 00:29:11,590
Miss Lyons would like to spend a day
with her family, but we don't do that.

278
00:29:11,726 --> 00:29:15,474
I really don't know, Danny.
Let me ask you something.

279
00:29:15,605 --> 00:29:19,603
- Who should get the commission?
- I spent 3 months setting up this deal.

280
00:29:19,734 --> 00:29:22,854
Who signed it? Me.
Who put it to bed? Me.

281
00:29:22,987 --> 00:29:26,819
It all boils down to the same thing.
Business is a game of inches.

282
00:29:26,949 --> 00:29:31,446
- Then don't give it to me.
- I want you to have it.

283
00:29:31,579 --> 00:29:36,371
When you started here, I said,
"Welcome aboard", and I meant it.

284
00:29:36,501 --> 00:29:39,786
All I'm trying to do
is show you a lesson.

285
00:29:46,761 --> 00:29:50,095
I'll be just a few more minutes.

286
00:29:50,223 --> 00:29:53,473
- How was work?
- I caught hell.

287
00:29:54,352 --> 00:29:59,595
- God, another smoker. Would you mind?
- I'm sorry, you're eating.

288
00:29:59,983 --> 00:30:04,894
- My boss is mad at me, too.
- I bet he was.

289
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:11,608
I just added another
seven minutes to your life.

290
00:30:13,246 --> 00:30:17,078
- I don't expect a thank you.
- Thank you.

291
00:30:29,262 --> 00:30:34,387
- Worried about Western civilization?
- Not particularly. Not tonight.

292
00:30:34,517 --> 00:30:40,805
- It's collapsing, or didn't you notice?
- I live in a pretty good neighbourhood.

293
00:30:41,482 --> 00:30:43,440
Sorry I kept you waiting.

294
00:30:44,277 --> 00:30:47,313
We have to go,
our movie starts in ten minutes.

295
00:30:48,781 --> 00:30:50,821
- Want to come?
- Sure.

296
00:30:55,538 --> 00:30:58,111
Give me a minute to get ready.

297
00:31:08,051 --> 00:31:11,301
Tomorrow ...
are we going to the auto show?

298
00:31:11,429 --> 00:31:15,296
- I was going to call Debbie.
- Seeing a lot of her, huh?

299
00:31:16,059 --> 00:31:19,973
- Have you called her this week?
- Twice.

300
00:31:20,063 --> 00:31:25,401
You called her twice? Never call
a broad more than once a week

301
00:31:29,322 --> 00:31:34,114
He forgets to call one day, big deal.
Two days, it's an oversight.

302
00:31:34,243 --> 00:31:39,155
- But 3 days? He's sleeping around.
- It's a free country.

303
00:31:45,922 --> 00:31:49,457
- That's ... what's-her-name.
- Debbie.

304
00:31:58,977 --> 00:32:01,432
We're in the middle of an issue.

305
00:32:01,562 --> 00:32:07,352
If he's going to sleep over 3 nights
a week, he can pay half the rent.

306
00:32:08,194 --> 00:32:14,363
But if I ask him to pay half the rent,
it's like asking him to move in with me.

307
00:32:14,617 --> 00:32:17,155
What's in it for you?

308
00:32:17,453 --> 00:32:22,115
- Maybe she loves the guy.
- Maybe I enjoy it.

309
00:32:22,417 --> 00:32:27,577
Would you put up with a dog
that came home three nights a week?

310
00:32:27,714 --> 00:32:31,379
- I'm going to make a phone call.
- That was funny.

311
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:46,352
Oh God, I'm sorry. This is no good.

312
00:32:49,777 --> 00:32:53,063
I don't think I can see you anymore.

313
00:32:53,197 --> 00:32:57,195
Don't be offended, because I like you.
I think you're terrific.

314
00:32:57,327 --> 00:33:03,032
It's just that I'm seeing someone else.

315
00:33:04,959 --> 00:33:09,502
- Who?
- Nobody. You don't know him.

316
00:33:11,799 --> 00:33:13,792
If that's the way you want it.

317
00:33:13,926 --> 00:33:17,093
See what happens when people
don't say, "I love you"?

318
00:33:17,889 --> 00:33:20,973
Sometimes you can be
a real son-of-a-bitch.

319
00:33:23,061 --> 00:33:27,354
Come on.
I thought we had something special.

320
00:33:27,482 --> 00:33:34,315
No, it was kind of sleazy.
And now ... it's kind of over.

321
00:33:40,119 --> 00:33:42,278
Just a minute.

322
00:33:51,965 --> 00:33:54,669
Are you okay? Is something wrong?

323
00:33:54,801 --> 00:33:57,920
Nothing. Everything is great.

324
00:34:00,515 --> 00:34:03,266
- Bye.
- Wait a minute.

325
00:34:05,353 --> 00:34:11,806
I wanted to let you know I was fine.
And now I have, so good night.

326
00:34:13,444 --> 00:34:16,860
I was going to call and ...
I should have called.

327
00:34:16,990 --> 00:34:21,782
Don't try to make me feel better.
I don't care if you call.

328
00:34:21,911 --> 00:34:26,075
In fact, don't!
Don't try to make me feel better.

329
00:34:26,207 --> 00:34:31,581
- Want to come in?
- I may be easy, but I'm not stupid.

330
00:34:31,713 --> 00:34:35,793
Just for a minute. I missed you.

331
00:34:35,925 --> 00:34:39,045
- Just for a minute.
- Absolutely not.

332
00:35:05,121 --> 00:35:09,830
You're so good.
You're the best.

333
00:35:09,959 --> 00:35:14,336
- You say that to all your guys.
- Yep, and they believe it.

334
00:35:17,383 --> 00:35:20,218
God, I love y ...

335
00:35:20,678 --> 00:35:26,384
- I love making love with you.
- I love making love with you, too.

336
00:35:28,936 --> 00:35:33,895
You're getting serious.
She seemed like a hell of a girl.

337
00:35:34,108 --> 00:35:38,651
What little I saw of her.
Not too this, not too that.

338
00:35:42,742 --> 00:35:48,994
I only saw her for a minute.
First impressions are often misleading.

339
00:35:51,334 --> 00:35:56,673
Does she give head?
To you. Does she give head to you?

340
00:36:00,677 --> 00:36:02,385
Forget it.

341
00:36:11,062 --> 00:36:15,391
Don't look at me like that.
Just get out of bed, you bum.

342
00:36:20,029 --> 00:36:22,864
I've been thinking.

343
00:36:22,991 --> 00:36:28,530
For the last two months, you've been
carrying your undies in a paper bag.

344
00:36:28,663 --> 00:36:31,699
I think you ought to have a drawer here.

345
00:36:31,833 --> 00:36:35,581
A drawer? A whole drawer?

346
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:40,834
That's a big step.
You'd better think about it.

347
00:36:40,967 --> 00:36:45,178
- Take a drawer.
- Are you sure?

348
00:36:45,263 --> 00:36:51,099
Maybe a small one in the kitchen
next to the utensils or something.

349
00:36:52,395 --> 00:36:58,231
Look at the divorce rate.
Men and women fight for their lives.

350
00:36:58,901 --> 00:37:02,353
The sexes relate in a very violent way.

351
00:37:02,488 --> 00:37:07,400
And we're the ones, who end up
giving up so much of ourselves.

352
00:37:07,535 --> 00:37:13,158
We lose so much along the way.
Come on, disagree with me.

353
00:37:13,291 --> 00:37:17,917
- I mean, it's a dirty job.
- I disagree with you.

354
00:37:20,423 --> 00:37:23,958
Are you going to drink that soda?

355
00:37:26,763 --> 00:37:32,883
- Perhaps I could have it.
- I'm moving in with Danny.

356
00:37:36,731 --> 00:37:38,439
I give you two months.

357
00:37:43,071 --> 00:37:46,605
What the hell do you think you're doing?

358
00:37:46,741 --> 00:37:49,149
Some of those are Joan's.

359
00:37:49,285 --> 00:37:52,986
- You want to separate them?
- They won't separate themselves.

360
00:37:53,122 --> 00:37:57,583
I don't suppose they will.
Is this your Shostakovich?

361
00:37:57,710 --> 00:38:02,419
It's Sho-sta-ko-vich, and it's mine.

362
00:38:02,674 --> 00:38:06,623
- What are we going to do about the TV?
- Why don't you keep it? I have a TV.

363
00:38:06,761 --> 00:38:12,431
Good for you. I insist on paying
half of it, so I'll write you a check.

364
00:38:12,558 --> 00:38:18,312
- Fine. I'll get it next week.
- Can you come by Tuesday night?

365
00:38:18,439 --> 00:38:22,982
- Can Debbie come by Tuesday night?
- That's funny.

366
00:38:23,111 --> 00:38:26,776
Why don't you take this,
and shove it up your ass?

367
00:38:26,906 --> 00:38:32,612
Very telling. On your instructions,
I am supposed to torture myself anally.

368
00:38:32,745 --> 00:38:37,573
Does Deborah know what you're into?
You're moving out, so move out.

369
00:38:37,709 --> 00:38:42,205
- She's moving out.
- Move her out and the hell with you.

370
00:38:42,338 --> 00:38:44,746
I hope you'll be very happy.

371
00:38:57,812 --> 00:38:59,390
I got it.

372
00:39:09,198 --> 00:39:11,191
That's it.

373
00:41:19,454 --> 00:41:23,534
- Do you want a cup of tea?
- Tea? No, thanks. I'm a coffee drinker.

374
00:41:23,666 --> 00:41:27,118
Come on, expand your horizons a little.

375
00:41:29,255 --> 00:41:31,497
I got it.

376
00:41:34,886 --> 00:41:38,006
Danny? Hi, it's Alex.

377
00:41:38,139 --> 00:41:40,630
Long time no see.

378
00:41:44,646 --> 00:41:50,648
- Is this a bad time?
- No ... I kind of met somebody.

379
00:41:55,448 --> 00:41:58,021
You think my husband and kids are
replicants?

380
00:41:58,159 --> 00:42:02,786
Sweetheart, we all have to make
sacrifices in our relationships.

381
00:42:04,874 --> 00:42:10,794
She's there.
Well, give her a kiss from me.

382
00:42:11,422 --> 00:42:15,420
I'd like to leave you
with one final bit of advice.

383
00:42:15,551 --> 00:42:18,387
I'm in the book.

384
00:42:19,764 --> 00:42:23,596
To tell you the truth,
we're living together.

385
00:42:24,727 --> 00:42:27,514
Her name is Debbie.

386
00:42:28,064 --> 00:42:31,184
Thank you, I'll tell her.

387
00:42:37,323 --> 00:42:42,484
- Don't tell me. Your cousin.
- No, that was my mom.

388
00:42:43,246 --> 00:42:48,489
Mom disappointed that you won't
be sleeping with her anymore?

389
00:42:48,584 --> 00:42:55,382
It was an old girlfriend. It's history.
You heard me say it, right?

390
00:42:55,466 --> 00:43:00,128
It's okay.
I'll just have to get used to it.

391
00:43:02,765 --> 00:43:05,968
What kind of tea is this?
It's actually pretty good ...

392
00:43:06,102 --> 00:43:09,685
What's going on?
Do you not want me here?

393
00:43:09,814 --> 00:43:14,642
You're right. We gave it our best shot,
but it didn't work out.

394
00:43:14,777 --> 00:43:20,697
This is nuts! We talked about it once
for 10 minutes in bed.

395
00:43:20,867 --> 00:43:25,244
- It's not that complicated.
- It's already different.

396
00:43:26,956 --> 00:43:29,625
Things are going to change a bit.

397
00:43:30,043 --> 00:43:33,708
We're not Siamese twins
fused at the hip.

398
00:43:33,963 --> 00:43:36,454
And we're not talking about marriage.

399
00:43:36,591 --> 00:43:39,378
- Are we?
- No.

400
00:43:39,969 --> 00:43:43,718
You'll have your life and your friends,
and I'll have ...

401
00:43:43,848 --> 00:43:48,095
You always have the right thing to say.

402
00:43:49,937 --> 00:43:54,765
You think my responses are programmed?

403
00:43:54,901 --> 00:44:00,061
- You think I'm a ... a replicant?
- Shit!

404
00:44:02,742 --> 00:44:08,246
- What are you doing? Give me that!
- I'm sorry.

405
00:44:09,248 --> 00:44:14,835
- I made this in Girl Scouts'.
- It's nice.

406
00:44:18,549 --> 00:44:22,879
It was for my hope chest.

407
00:44:31,896 --> 00:44:35,479
This is our place.

408
00:44:37,485 --> 00:44:41,697
You're not an overnight guest anymore.

409
00:44:44,617 --> 00:44:46,325
Danny, heads up.

410
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:51,698
- Who the hell is that?
- It's Carmen. She works in shipping.

411
00:44:51,833 --> 00:44:57,171
See that look she just gave you?
You know she isn't wearing underpants.

412
00:44:57,255 --> 00:45:02,000
Here she comes.
Hi, how are you?

413
00:45:02,135 --> 00:45:04,376
This is Danny.

414
00:45:07,765 --> 00:45:12,178
- How's what's-her-name?
- Debbie. She's great.

415
00:45:13,187 --> 00:45:18,395
What do you guys do?
Go to the zoo? Go shopping?

416
00:45:18,526 --> 00:45:23,769
She looks very intellectual.
That's not always a bad thing.

417
00:45:23,906 --> 00:45:29,861
If a guy wants to get on with a broad
on a stable basis, who's to say no.

418
00:45:31,164 --> 00:45:34,580
A lot of broads today,
you just don't know.

419
00:45:34,709 --> 00:45:38,327
A woman in today's society
who's 22-23 ...

420
00:45:38,463 --> 00:45:42,412
You don't know
where the fuck she's been.

421
00:45:42,592 --> 00:45:44,881
It's your business.

422
00:45:45,011 --> 00:45:50,052
You guys go out and have lunch.
We'll make you a lot of money.

423
00:45:50,183 --> 00:45:54,477
- Danny. Shit-can the Sparrow.
- The Swallow?

424
00:45:54,604 --> 00:46:00,891
No more credit, he's two months behind.
Danny, he's a loser. Cut him off.

425
00:46:07,033 --> 00:46:10,153
For $600 I can have him put to sleep.

426
00:46:10,286 --> 00:46:14,200
Don't do this to me.
You're cutting my throat.

427
00:46:14,332 --> 00:46:18,910
How many years do we go back?
I've always paid.

428
00:46:19,045 --> 00:46:21,168
I'll change the menu. Look at me.

429
00:46:23,925 --> 00:46:28,385
It was my Dad's place. I'm begging you.

430
00:46:28,513 --> 00:46:32,557
In front of God, my family,
the neighbourhood ...

431
00:46:32,684 --> 00:46:36,302
Please, don't do this to me.

432
00:46:43,903 --> 00:46:46,275
I'm sorry, honey.

433
00:46:47,407 --> 00:46:49,446
It's alright.

434
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:54,575
Is everything okay?

435
00:46:57,792 --> 00:47:00,200
Are you sure?

436
00:47:00,753 --> 00:47:05,830
- Sure. Are you okay?
- Sure.

437
00:47:22,066 --> 00:47:26,479
Dan, you up?

438
00:47:27,322 --> 00:47:32,446
Are you sleeping? You asleep?

439
00:47:34,954 --> 00:47:38,904
I can't sleep.

440
00:47:41,002 --> 00:47:45,463
Are you sleeping? Did I wake you?

441
00:48:06,986 --> 00:48:11,981
- Nose hair clippers.
- I didn't know what ...

442
00:48:13,117 --> 00:48:18,194
- Nose hair.
- I'm sorry, I shouldn't be ...

443
00:48:18,331 --> 00:48:21,996
- I was snooping.
- It's okay.

444
00:48:22,126 --> 00:48:25,745
No, it's not right. It's wrong.

445
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:28,667
It's wrong
that I don't know you very well.

446
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:32,667
I'm sneaking through your drawers,
looking for I don't know what.

447
00:48:35,390 --> 00:48:40,514
- This is wrong. Everything's wrong.
- What's wrong?

448
00:48:40,728 --> 00:48:44,940
I don't want to be your roommate.

449
00:48:45,024 --> 00:48:49,152
I had a roommate.

450
00:48:49,237 --> 00:48:53,365
I want to be closer.
I want to be a couple.

451
00:48:55,118 --> 00:49:00,076
- We can do that. I thought you said ...
- I don't care what I said.

452
00:49:00,206 --> 00:49:04,286
I just want to know you better.

453
00:49:04,419 --> 00:49:09,460
And when something's bothering you,
I want to know about it.

454
00:49:09,590 --> 00:49:15,629
- Because it's my problem, too.
- We can do that.

455
00:49:18,474 --> 00:49:25,307
- I just don't want you to be unhappy.
- I'm not unhappy. I'm not.

456
00:52:37,090 --> 00:52:43,258
- I hope we didn't wake Mrs Boelter.
- I know she can hear us.

457
00:52:50,770 --> 00:52:53,095
- Don't move.
- What?

458
00:52:53,231 --> 00:52:57,394
- You look so good in that light.
- What light?

459
00:52:57,527 --> 00:53:01,904
- The light coming through the window.
- Get out of here.

460
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:09,078
God, you're so beautiful.

461
00:53:18,423 --> 00:53:21,340
I love you, Danny.

462
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:25,298
I love you, too.

463
00:53:45,033 --> 00:53:49,445
- Who said it first?
- I did.

464
00:53:52,749 --> 00:53:55,952
Was it before you came or after?

465
00:54:00,673 --> 00:54:04,042
- That bathroom is so tiny.
- Was he home?

466
00:54:04,177 --> 00:54:10,844
- When you called, was he home?
- No, but it's sandwich night anyway.

467
00:54:17,273 --> 00:54:21,401
Two nights a week I cook.
Two nights a week he cooks.

468
00:54:21,527 --> 00:54:26,189
Two nights we go out.
And then there's sandwich night.

469
00:54:26,407 --> 00:54:29,741
I bet your sex life is a real thrill.

470
00:54:29,869 --> 00:54:33,487
Two nights a week you're on top.
Two nights a week he's on top.

471
00:54:33,623 --> 00:54:36,956
So what is it you do on sandwich night?

472
00:54:41,255 --> 00:54:45,585
So is this guy going to marry you?

473
00:54:45,718 --> 00:54:49,930
Are you insane?
We don't talk about marriage.

474
00:54:50,056 --> 00:54:53,389
We don't talk about next week.

475
00:54:54,060 --> 00:54:58,354
We just don't talk about things -

476
00:55:00,191 --> 00:55:04,141
- that are just stuff like that.
You know?

477
00:55:10,994 --> 00:55:13,781
So how about those Cubs, huh?

478
00:55:17,458 --> 00:55:19,581
Hi, honey.

479
00:55:24,841 --> 00:55:28,210
- Is something wrong?
- No, it's fine.

480
00:55:30,263 --> 00:55:35,719
- Don't worry. You're not a daddy.
- I'm not? Was I?

481
00:55:36,477 --> 00:55:41,685
No, I was late and I was worried,
so I just checked it out.

482
00:55:44,569 --> 00:55:48,946
- I thought we were being careful.
- We were.

483
00:55:49,073 --> 00:55:54,613
I was ... I am. I was late and
I was worried that I was pregnant.

484
00:55:55,872 --> 00:55:57,330
But you're not.

485
00:55:58,541 --> 00:56:01,114
No, I'm not.

486
00:56:03,755 --> 00:56:05,878
Great.

487
00:56:13,639 --> 00:56:17,886
- I'm sorry, honey.
- It's no big deal.

488
00:56:19,437 --> 00:56:23,648
- You look sad.
- I'm fine.

489
00:56:25,026 --> 00:56:27,813
- Are you disappointed?
- No.

490
00:56:29,572 --> 00:56:33,617
Honest to God,
I didn't want to be pregnant.

491
00:56:33,743 --> 00:56:36,151
I just, you know ...

492
00:56:36,287 --> 00:56:39,703
I was ... I thought ...

493
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:46,412
Well, maybe I am a little.

494
00:56:52,929 --> 00:56:56,843
Martin, you're 14-carat fuck-up!

495
00:56:56,974 --> 00:57:00,509
- Something wrong?
- Goddam "smart mouth".

496
00:57:00,645 --> 00:57:04,856
You think people like that mouth?
Mr big shot.

497
00:57:04,982 --> 00:57:07,652
- Why didn't you cut out that dump?
- The Swallow?

498
00:57:07,777 --> 00:57:13,447
I say dump, you connect it with
the Swallow. You know what a swallow is?

499
00:57:13,574 --> 00:57:18,949
- It's a bird.
- Yeah, a loser bird. A dodo.

500
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:23,658
- He gave us a lot of business.
- I told you to freeze him out.

501
00:57:23,793 --> 00:57:28,455
- The guy's got a family.
- The whole country's full of families!

502
00:57:28,589 --> 00:57:32,089
- Business is business. Cut him off.
- Fuck you.

503
00:57:32,218 --> 00:57:34,791
- Fuck me? Fuck you.
- Fuck you!

504
00:57:34,929 --> 00:57:37,088
Fuck you, Martin.

505
00:57:42,895 --> 00:57:46,514
Good morning, officer.
Top of the morning to you.

506
00:57:48,609 --> 00:57:54,445
Honey, I'll be home around six.
Shall I pick you up some beer?

507
00:57:58,161 --> 00:58:01,115
Are you going to be okay?

508
00:58:02,415 --> 00:58:05,120
I hate that son-of-a-bitch.

509
00:58:05,251 --> 00:58:07,493
If you don't want to go back to work,
don't go.

510
00:58:07,628 --> 00:58:09,787
Honey, it's what I do.

511
00:58:09,922 --> 00:58:13,754
I have spent my life stuffing
more unneeded restaurant supplies -

512
00:58:13,885 --> 00:58:18,926
- on the shelves of more unneeded
restaurants than any other salesman.

513
00:58:19,057 --> 00:58:24,299
I didn't finish college. I don't have
a million bucks. What am I going to do?

514
00:58:24,437 --> 00:58:28,304
You've said you wanted to
open up your own restaurant.

515
00:58:28,441 --> 00:58:33,103
- How? With what?
- You can go to a bank.

516
00:58:33,237 --> 00:58:37,187
- Honey, it's complicated.
- It's not that complicated.

517
00:58:37,325 --> 00:58:41,572
I'm making plenty of money
to tide us over.

518
00:58:49,837 --> 00:58:53,206
I'm sorry. Just trying to help.

519
00:59:02,016 --> 00:59:04,851
- Favio wants you back.
- Did he apologize?

520
00:59:04,977 --> 00:59:09,022
- You want a fucking dozen roses?
- I should have decked him.

521
00:59:09,148 --> 00:59:11,355
You're a lunatic.

522
00:59:11,484 --> 00:59:16,775
In six more years,
you get profit sharing and Favio's job.

523
00:59:16,864 --> 00:59:21,941
And I'm plugging Mrs Lyons and
chewing the ass of guys like you and me.

524
00:59:22,078 --> 00:59:28,199
You didn't say that 3 months ago.
Come on, what is it?

525
00:59:28,334 --> 00:59:31,917
- Does she want you out?
- What?

526
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:38,754
Is she pushing you to get out?
The permanent piece at home.

527
00:59:38,803 --> 00:59:44,046
- Don't start on her.
- What the fuck is your problem?

528
00:59:44,183 --> 00:59:47,220
You don't go here, you don't go there.
You have no job.

529
00:59:47,353 --> 00:59:50,140
You're as much fun as a stick.

530
00:59:50,398 --> 00:59:56,519
I'd cut him off, but it's your decision.
I just wish you'd come back.

531
01:00:06,497 --> 01:00:08,407
I miss you, man.

532
01:00:24,390 --> 01:00:28,684
I know you did what you could.

533
01:00:28,895 --> 01:00:31,730
Thanks.

534
01:00:36,319 --> 01:00:38,276
In here.

535
01:00:40,948 --> 01:00:44,199
Are you going to play basketball?

536
01:00:44,952 --> 01:00:50,029
- Could I show you this first ...
- Could you clean up some of this shit?

537
01:00:51,542 --> 01:00:56,085
- Did you get a turkey for tomorrow?
- No, I got a ham.

538
01:00:56,214 --> 01:00:59,665
You can't have ham for Thanksgiving,
you have to have a turkey.

539
01:00:59,801 --> 01:01:03,419
You'll have turkey sandwiches
until Easter.

540
01:01:03,554 --> 01:01:06,721
- I told Bernie we'd have turkey.
- You asked Bernie?

541
01:01:06,849 --> 01:01:11,179
- He's my friend.
- Then I'll ask Joan.

542
01:01:11,312 --> 01:01:15,357
- They'll be at each other's throats.
- Then don't invite her.

543
01:01:15,483 --> 01:01:19,777
- I will, she's my friend.
- Suit yourself.

544
01:01:21,197 --> 01:01:26,025
- Did I do something wrong?
- No.

545
01:01:28,037 --> 01:01:32,865
I went back to work today
with my goddam tail between my legs.

546
01:01:39,424 --> 01:01:42,378
I'll leave you alone.

547
01:02:19,839 --> 01:02:24,216
I don't care what you did
or who you were with.

548
01:02:24,344 --> 01:02:27,677
I would have appreciated a call
and maybe a little help today.

549
01:02:27,805 --> 01:02:32,384
- I'm hung over, so shoot me.
- Don't tempt me.

550
01:02:33,102 --> 01:02:37,100
Besides, they can't eat all this.
Don't work so hard for Bernie.

551
01:02:38,775 --> 01:02:43,235
It's for Joan, too. Please put
the cranberry sauce in that dish.

552
01:02:43,363 --> 01:02:47,028
All of these airs and graces
are for Joan.

553
01:02:47,158 --> 01:02:52,449
It's for both.
At least Joan sits down while she eats.

554
01:02:52,580 --> 01:02:56,364
She's a real lady, that one.

555
01:02:56,501 --> 01:03:02,124
You want me to make Bernie feel at home?
I'll serve him some bread and Velveeta.

556
01:03:02,256 --> 01:03:09,469
He's a better person than that bitch
on wheels. She's trying to sabotage us.

557
01:03:09,597 --> 01:03:16,347
And he's full of comfort and support.
He hates me and I'm slaving for him.

558
01:03:16,521 --> 01:03:19,391
- I did all the hard stuff.
- You did not!

559
01:03:20,650 --> 01:03:23,567
- Danny, please, you did not!
- I did, too.

560
01:03:23,736 --> 01:03:28,197
I mashed the potatoes, made the stuffing
and a salad. You cooked the turkey.

561
01:03:28,324 --> 01:03:31,907
You son-of-a-bitch! I did all the
shopping, all the preparations.

562
01:03:32,161 --> 01:03:35,447
Look at this goddam spread.

563
01:03:46,676 --> 01:03:51,919
God, she looks great.
And she baked us a pie. That's terrific.

564
01:03:52,432 --> 01:03:57,972
Your vulgarian friend is downstairs
denting innocent people's fenders.

565
01:04:05,403 --> 01:04:08,190
Nice feed.

566
01:04:08,698 --> 01:04:12,316
You got a terrific little homemaker.

567
01:04:21,461 --> 01:04:26,206
- Guess who's been asking about you.
- Carmen? What did she say?

568
01:04:26,341 --> 01:04:30,338
- You're practically a married man.
- Come on, what did she say?

569
01:04:30,470 --> 01:04:34,514
Basically, she's got this desire
to GRAB YOUR JOINT!

570
01:04:35,892 --> 01:04:39,142
Shut up! Touchdown!

571
01:04:44,192 --> 01:04:47,276
It's official. I've become my mother.

572
01:04:47,403 --> 01:04:50,772
- Did he help at all?
- Hardly. I hate this spoon.

573
01:04:50,907 --> 01:04:54,774
Let me tell you about Gary.

574
01:04:54,911 --> 01:05:01,827
He's tall. He's nice to me.
He's intelligent.

575
01:05:02,835 --> 01:05:06,251
And he doesn't make me sleep
in the wet spot.

576
01:05:06,381 --> 01:05:09,335
It's a trick. I bet he's a shit.

577
01:05:09,592 --> 01:05:12,878
I think he is truly concerned
with my happiness.

578
01:05:13,012 --> 01:05:17,888
Then he'll be a big help next year,
when we all come to your house.

579
01:05:18,017 --> 01:05:24,102
He's asked me out for New Year's.
And did I mention that he is a lawyer?

580
01:05:25,692 --> 01:05:31,362
I have to meet him in half an hour
so let's smoke this now.

581
01:05:33,866 --> 01:05:39,655
I haven't been stoned in ages.
He doesn't like to smoke.

582
01:05:54,971 --> 01:05:57,972
Do I seem different to you?

583
01:06:00,601 --> 01:06:04,184
All I'm saying is that maid service
is not included in the package -

584
01:06:04,313 --> 01:06:07,564
- and if you want to do this
little domestic show in the future -

585
01:06:07,692 --> 01:06:10,812
- just be ready to handle the weight.

586
01:06:14,407 --> 01:06:20,659
I should have, but I didn't.
I won't always follow your grand plan.

587
01:06:20,788 --> 01:06:24,738
- I don't have any grand plan.
- Who invented sandwich night?

588
01:06:24,876 --> 01:06:28,458
That has nothing to do with this.
All I'm asking for is help.

589
01:06:28,588 --> 01:06:33,131
Because you tried to turn this dinner
into a damn Norman Rockwell painting.

590
01:06:33,259 --> 01:06:36,710
Please don't put this on the counter.
See this black stuff?

591
01:06:36,846 --> 01:06:39,930
It gets in the porcelain,
and then on my fingers.

592
01:06:40,058 --> 01:06:41,600
I'll make an effort.

593
01:06:41,726 --> 01:06:47,432
And make an effort to put these
wrappers in the trash. Or flush them.

594
01:06:48,566 --> 01:06:50,938
You want me to waste
8 gallons of water -

595
01:06:51,069 --> 01:06:54,235
- so you don't have to see
paper with "Tampax" written on it?

596
01:06:54,364 --> 01:06:58,693
You didn't even say "Tampax".
Does it offend you that much?

597
01:06:58,826 --> 01:07:03,903
- Just hit the trash can or the toilet.
- I'll work on my dunk shot.

598
01:07:04,040 --> 01:07:08,334
You don't need all that shit.
You look pretty the way you are.

599
01:07:08,461 --> 01:07:12,589
You look great the way you are.

600
01:07:12,840 --> 01:07:16,920
Why do you wear all that stuff?
To impress your boss?

601
01:07:18,638 --> 01:07:24,142
- Bernie says you go out with him.
- I used to. It's no big secret.

602
01:07:24,644 --> 01:07:28,179
- Then why didn't I know about it?
- You never asked.

603
01:07:28,314 --> 01:07:32,691
- Did you sleep with him?
- No, we were bowling partners.

604
01:07:32,819 --> 01:07:37,481
So you fucked him, and you see him
every goddam day. That's just great.

605
01:07:37,615 --> 01:07:43,736
I'm not sleeping around. If that's what
you want, then have the balls to say so.

606
01:07:46,666 --> 01:07:49,833
- Where are you going?
- I'm not staying here.

607
01:07:49,961 --> 01:07:52,831
- I'll leave.
- Don't be ridiculous. You live here.

608
01:07:52,964 --> 01:07:55,336
We live here!

609
01:08:11,774 --> 01:08:14,859
He is not worth it.

610
01:08:14,986 --> 01:08:19,944
- I hate that number they play.
- Establishing dominance?

611
01:08:20,033 --> 01:08:23,318
I feel like a fire hydrant
that's been pissed on.

612
01:08:23,453 --> 01:08:27,497
Maybe it's job-related.
He does sell toilet paper.

613
01:08:33,171 --> 01:08:36,836
I don't know what I'm doing.

614
01:08:37,884 --> 01:08:42,593
I feel like we're
a couple of kids playing house.

615
01:08:43,431 --> 01:08:49,884
- What's it supposed to be like?
- Holidays are hard on some guys.

616
01:08:51,272 --> 01:08:55,519
That's not it. I used the big "L" word.

617
01:08:55,651 --> 01:09:00,990
You tell someone you love them
and all you get is a headache.

618
01:09:02,075 --> 01:09:06,119
- What's going on?
- There's someone I want you to meet.

619
01:09:10,416 --> 01:09:16,537
- Nice to meet you. Excuse the attire.
- She had a blow-out with her boyfriend.

620
01:09:18,508 --> 01:09:22,173
Guys can be real assholes sometimes.

621
01:09:22,303 --> 01:09:27,677
Get some sleep and it'll all get fixed
in the morning. He'll come around.

622
01:09:27,934 --> 01:09:32,014
And if he doesn't,
you can always move back in here.

623
01:10:16,858 --> 01:10:22,445
"And then an angel of the Lord
descended upon the Virgin Mary"

624
01:10:22,572 --> 01:10:28,491
- What's "descended"?
- Came down from out of the sky.

625
01:10:30,246 --> 01:10:35,323
"And then an angel of the Lord
descended upon the Virgin Mary ... "

626
01:10:35,460 --> 01:10:38,164
What's a virgin?

627
01:10:40,757 --> 01:10:47,126
- That is someone who's never had sex.
- What's sex?

628
01:10:49,432 --> 01:10:55,684
- Sex is how men and women make babies.
- Are you a virgin?

629
01:10:57,190 --> 01:11:01,104
- No.
- So you have a baby?

630
01:11:02,528 --> 01:11:08,816
No ... Men and women
who don't want babies, also have sex.

631
01:11:08,951 --> 01:11:12,486
- What for?
- For about 10 or 15 minutes.

632
01:11:16,584 --> 01:11:23,298
And Santa came down the chimney ...
Dan, hold on a second.

633
01:11:28,304 --> 01:11:32,384
There's a broad who's dying
to meet you. Come here.

634
01:11:32,600 --> 01:11:36,016
This is Carmen. This is Danny.

635
01:11:39,315 --> 01:11:44,772
Bernie says you want to go dancing
later on. Like, what time?

636
01:11:45,738 --> 01:11:49,024
I have to take a rain check tonight.

637
01:11:53,705 --> 01:11:57,572
Come dancing.
We'll go to my place, have a party.

638
01:11:57,709 --> 01:12:03,545
- Play "Spin the Pickle".
- I can't. There's been tension at home.

639
01:12:04,215 --> 01:12:10,170
I'm sorry about that, Dan.
But Carmen is a sure thing. She's hot.

640
01:12:10,346 --> 01:12:13,798
She'll grab your joint
on the dance floor.

641
01:12:13,891 --> 01:12:16,513
Merry Christmas, Bernie.

642
01:12:17,979 --> 01:12:20,268
Yeah, merry Christmas, Danny.

643
01:12:21,524 --> 01:12:25,652
My friend, Alan. How are you?

644
01:12:29,657 --> 01:12:31,484
Hold this for me, please.

645
01:12:47,425 --> 01:12:51,968
- Don't you think about me anymore?
- Sure.

646
01:12:52,096 --> 01:12:57,636
- What we had was pretty good.
- It was fine.

647
01:12:59,020 --> 01:13:02,353
Remember last year's party?
What we did in here?

648
01:13:02,482 --> 01:13:08,187
- Steve, don't. Just turn on the lights.
- I couldn't keep you from laughing.

649
01:13:09,947 --> 01:13:13,399
- There's somebody else now.
- I don't see a ring.

650
01:13:13,534 --> 01:13:19,786
I don't need a ring, asshole.
Look at me. Don't I look different?

651
01:13:19,957 --> 01:13:24,916
I'm in love, can't you tell?
This has never happened to me before.

652
01:13:25,004 --> 01:13:29,631
I want to have ten kids with this guy.
Jesus, doesn't it show?

653
01:13:31,552 --> 01:13:34,257
Does he love you?

654
01:13:35,681 --> 01:13:38,089
I don't know.

655
01:13:43,481 --> 01:13:45,723
Good luck.

656
01:13:51,364 --> 01:13:54,863
This is my boss, Steve.
This is Dan.

657
01:13:55,660 --> 01:13:58,495
Take it easy, it's alright.

658
01:14:00,206 --> 01:14:02,364
Take it easy.

659
01:15:34,217 --> 01:15:37,134
This is great, honey.

660
01:15:42,058 --> 01:15:46,138
- You look very elegant in that suit.
- My girlfriend picked it out.

661
01:15:46,270 --> 01:15:48,844
She did?

662
01:15:53,820 --> 01:16:00,190
To you ... to me ... to us.
And to a happy New Year.

663
01:16:13,548 --> 01:16:15,706
Like it?

664
01:16:15,800 --> 01:16:19,501
I used pecans in the dressing.

665
01:16:29,022 --> 01:16:34,941
This is Bernie. You with your girl?
Get your ass down to Mother's now.

666
01:16:37,363 --> 01:16:42,405
- Bernie?
- What's left of him. He's at Mother's.

667
01:16:43,369 --> 01:16:46,204
Everybody's at Mother's.

668
01:17:00,762 --> 01:17:03,679
- Let's go.
- Are you sure?

669
01:17:21,824 --> 01:17:25,739
Happy New Year.
I've been waiting for you.

670
01:17:25,870 --> 01:17:29,453
This is Crystal.
I want to show you this bit.

671
01:17:29,582 --> 01:17:32,832
I won't let you go until you do it.

672
01:17:37,465 --> 01:17:43,088
- It gets old if you do it too much.
- This is Debbie. Show her your tattoo.

673
01:17:43,221 --> 01:17:47,966
Let's get a drink.
I'll be the Refrigerator, you be Payton.

674
01:17:50,144 --> 01:17:52,896
Danny, dance with me.

675
01:18:02,156 --> 01:18:04,943
- You look great.
- So do you.

676
01:18:25,555 --> 01:18:27,263
Let's go.

677
01:18:43,197 --> 01:18:47,658
I bet you're terrific.
I know I am.

678
01:18:47,744 --> 01:18:50,661
Maybe someday we'll find out.

679
01:18:53,958 --> 01:18:56,449
Wait, wait ... now!

680
01:19:02,967 --> 01:19:07,012
Good to see you again.
I've been waiting all night to see you.

681
01:19:07,180 --> 01:19:12,138
- How about now?
- Right here?

682
01:19:15,855 --> 01:19:19,687
I couldn't tell you before.

683
01:19:19,817 --> 01:19:26,698
- Just one little kiss.
- One New Year's kiss.

684
01:19:36,209 --> 01:19:39,660
- Joan, please. Calm down!
- Get away from me!

685
01:19:39,796 --> 01:19:44,292
Let me get by. Get away from me.
You are a son-of-a-bitch.

686
01:19:46,552 --> 01:19:49,090
You stay away from me.

687
01:19:57,563 --> 01:20:02,984
- Joan, what's wrong?
- What the hell do you care?

688
01:20:03,111 --> 01:20:08,781
I care ... I'm sorry.
I haven't been a good friend lately.

689
01:20:10,243 --> 01:20:14,905
- Nothing! Just leave me alone!
- Just give us a minute.

690
01:20:15,039 --> 01:20:20,626
- I am such a fool.
- Tell me. I'm your best friend.

691
01:20:20,753 --> 01:20:26,708
- He's going back with his wife.
- I didn't even know he was married.

692
01:20:26,801 --> 01:20:30,051
Neither did I.

693
01:20:38,771 --> 01:20:44,940
- Chug it, Bernie.
- I can't drink any more champagne.

694
01:20:48,156 --> 01:20:51,275
- I'm taking Joan home.
- It's almost midnight.

695
01:20:51,409 --> 01:20:52,951
She's really a mess.

696
01:20:53,077 --> 01:20:57,407
She always falls apart
so you have to take care of her.

697
01:20:57,540 --> 01:20:59,367
Gary just dumped her.

698
01:20:59,500 --> 01:21:04,495
Proving to herself once again
that all men are selfish bastards.

699
01:21:04,630 --> 01:21:07,881
That broad doesn't know a thing
about keeping a guy happy.

700
01:21:08,009 --> 01:21:10,761
I'm surprised he didn't
leave skid marks.

701
01:21:10,887 --> 01:21:13,841
- Just put her in a cab.
- It's New Year's Eve.

702
01:21:13,973 --> 01:21:18,469
Give the cabbie $50
and maybe she'll get a New Year's pop.

703
01:21:18,603 --> 01:21:23,015
- Sometimes you're just slime.
- Don't you see a pattern here?

704
01:21:23,149 --> 01:21:29,733
She puts her hooks in him and he tries
for daylight and he's the asshole.

705
01:21:29,864 --> 01:21:32,948
No, you're the asshole!

706
01:21:40,166 --> 01:21:44,033
- What the hell was that all about?
- She needs me.

707
01:21:44,170 --> 01:21:48,666
- I need you.
- To help you have a good time?

708
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:51,801
When was the last time
we had a good time?

709
01:21:51,928 --> 01:21:58,511
Go back to your friends in the bar.
The hooks are out, so run for daylight.

710
01:21:58,601 --> 01:22:03,892
That's great. Happy New Year.

711
01:22:15,952 --> 01:22:18,241
In here.

712
01:22:36,180 --> 01:22:38,506
I'm sorry. It's not working out, is it?

713
01:22:41,436 --> 01:22:43,559
Here we go.

714
01:22:46,983 --> 01:22:48,940
Just say it.

715
01:22:51,446 --> 01:22:55,775
Just say what you're going to say.

716
01:23:07,545 --> 01:23:11,709
I think one of us should move out.

717
01:23:15,636 --> 01:23:18,803
I do, too.

718
01:23:19,891 --> 01:23:23,010
I'm sorry.

719
01:23:23,811 --> 01:23:27,856
- I said I'm sorry.
- What are you sorry for?

720
01:23:30,276 --> 01:23:35,816
I'm sorry that it didn't work out.
I need some time.

721
01:23:36,699 --> 01:23:40,567
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

722
01:23:40,703 --> 01:23:46,243
You started strong and you're finishing
like a wimp. Quit while you're ahead.

723
01:23:46,376 --> 01:23:50,788
- That's what I'm trying to do.
- Let's see your face on that one.

724
01:23:54,092 --> 01:23:56,168
Do you mind?

725
01:23:56,511 --> 01:24:01,932
Good. I think we've been
in the dark long enough.

726
01:24:10,983 --> 01:24:15,692
I know why I'm leaving.
What killed it for you?

727
01:24:15,822 --> 01:24:20,116
The radical change in your lifestyle?
Decided you wanted to travel light?

728
01:24:21,994 --> 01:24:26,573
Or did you fear someone better would
come along while you were stuck with me?

729
01:24:26,708 --> 01:24:31,832
Why can't you see it for what it is?
Nothing more, nothing less.

730
01:24:32,130 --> 01:24:37,586
Two people committed to screwing
until they get sick of each other?

731
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:42,090
I don't want marriage.
I don't want children.

732
01:24:43,516 --> 01:24:47,181
I don't want to be tied down.

733
01:24:49,105 --> 01:24:51,596
I'm not happy.

734
01:24:53,234 --> 01:24:58,311
I don't ... love you anymore.

735
01:25:05,121 --> 01:25:10,281
Fine.
I'm gone. It's done.

736
01:25:11,586 --> 01:25:14,622
You can go back to doing
whatever you want to do -

737
01:25:14,756 --> 01:25:19,418
- with whoever you want to do it with
in whatever orifice you want to.

738
01:25:19,552 --> 01:25:23,881
You leave here knowing one thing.
I never fooled around.

739
01:25:24,932 --> 01:25:32,145
Let's give the boy a medal.
I didn't know it was such a sacrifice.

740
01:26:23,783 --> 01:26:26,072
Are you okay?

741
01:26:26,202 --> 01:26:31,362
Could you not be here tomorrow
so I can pick up the rest of my stuff?

742
01:26:36,254 --> 01:26:41,592
Honey, I hope you find him someday.

743
01:27:16,836 --> 01:27:20,170
- I knew you'd be back on your feet.
- You know what? I like women.

744
01:27:20,298 --> 01:27:23,133
I like all kinds of women.

745
01:27:23,259 --> 01:27:28,135
I especially like women
I don't know very well.

746
01:27:28,306 --> 01:27:31,722
He's back. He's happening.

747
01:27:38,024 --> 01:27:41,191
This is the place.

748
01:27:41,861 --> 01:27:43,735
Tonight we ride.

749
01:27:43,863 --> 01:27:48,988
A bottle of your best cognac
and fresh horses for the men.

750
01:27:51,037 --> 01:27:53,706
I have a little confession to make.

751
01:27:53,831 --> 01:27:59,288
When Ira told me he was fixing
me up with Joan's best friend -

752
01:27:59,921 --> 01:28:05,377
- I was a tad apprehensive.
You know how awful this can be, right?

753
01:28:05,510 --> 01:28:11,050
I was not the least bit prepared for
her to be so charming and delightful.

754
01:28:11,182 --> 01:28:13,340
You're very sweet.

755
01:28:13,476 --> 01:28:19,514
And that accent. Couldn't you
just listen to him all night?

756
01:28:20,233 --> 01:28:23,684
Colin's too bashful to mention it,
but he's a whiz at card tricks.

757
01:28:23,820 --> 01:28:27,402
Don't put me on the spot like that.

758
01:28:27,532 --> 01:28:31,232
Those are exquisite earrings.

759
01:28:33,037 --> 01:28:36,951
Where did this come from?
Did you know it was up there?

760
01:28:49,303 --> 01:28:52,139
I'm going home.

761
01:29:06,112 --> 01:29:09,232
Good morning to you.

762
01:29:09,365 --> 01:29:14,111
I had such a wonderful time last night.
You were so good.

763
01:29:14,245 --> 01:29:18,112
I have breakfast in the oven.
I hope you like soufflé.

764
01:29:18,249 --> 01:29:21,001
And I talked to my mother ...

765
01:29:54,118 --> 01:29:56,325
Are we doing it here
because it's exotic -

766
01:29:56,454 --> 01:29:59,621
- or are you having your place
bombed for roaches?

767
01:30:06,923 --> 01:30:10,208
Do you live around here?

768
01:30:23,689 --> 01:30:27,734
- I'm sorry.
- Are you going in?

769
01:30:29,195 --> 01:30:32,529
I really like you a lot.

770
01:30:42,375 --> 01:30:44,747
I can't do this.

771
01:30:44,877 --> 01:30:50,548
I have my eyes closed
and I'm thinking you're somebody else.

772
01:30:50,675 --> 01:30:55,835
I'm really sorry.
What am I going to do?

773
01:30:59,016 --> 01:31:03,892
You didn't close?
Is that what you're telling me?

774
01:31:04,021 --> 01:31:07,853
- You leave a chick like that hanging?
- I don't know.

775
01:31:07,984 --> 01:31:10,938
Tits and ass, tits and ass ...

776
01:31:12,613 --> 01:31:16,279
Bloody blue, bloody blue ...

777
01:31:17,785 --> 01:31:20,703
- I don't know.
- So don't know.

778
01:31:20,830 --> 01:31:24,993
You want to sell your birthright
for a bit of pussy?

779
01:31:25,418 --> 01:31:27,457
You back off!
She was the best thing that ...

780
01:31:27,587 --> 01:31:33,340
She was the best fuck you ever had.
You're thinking with your dick.

781
01:31:33,468 --> 01:31:38,710
No, I loved her. Don't you understand?
I still love her.

782
01:31:39,807 --> 01:31:43,757
I understand.

783
01:31:46,397 --> 01:31:51,558
I do. You know this babe last night?

784
01:31:51,819 --> 01:31:54,820
You got her number or what?

785
01:31:54,947 --> 01:31:58,447
You've got problems.

786
01:32:00,328 --> 01:32:03,661
Don't ever lose your sense of humour.

787
01:32:23,017 --> 01:32:27,679
Hey, stranger.
How's it going?

788
01:32:27,814 --> 01:32:34,267
We have a bad connection.
I can't hear you. Let's talk over lunch.

789
01:32:34,404 --> 01:32:38,484
- You're serious?
- Yeah, I am. Hang on a second.

790
01:32:43,788 --> 01:32:46,030
I'm sorry.

791
01:32:46,165 --> 01:32:50,377
I don't know what I was trying to
figure out. These last few weeks ...

792
01:32:50,503 --> 01:32:53,076
They've been miserable.

793
01:32:53,214 --> 01:32:59,003
I can't stand going out or being
at home, because it reminds me of you.

794
01:32:59,429 --> 01:33:01,137
I can't work.

795
01:33:01,431 --> 01:33:03,340
Everything is falling apart -

796
01:33:03,474 --> 01:33:08,813
- because I miss you.
I need to see you again.

797
01:33:09,397 --> 01:33:11,852
I'll send you a picture.

798
01:33:13,401 --> 01:33:17,778
Just give me one more chance.

799
01:33:18,823 --> 01:33:23,200
I don't want you ever
to bother me again.

800
01:33:56,778 --> 01:34:02,780
- Are you sure you want to be here?
- It's St. Patrick's Day.

801
01:34:03,493 --> 01:34:08,155
- Guess who I met at the supermarket?
- St. Patrick?

802
01:34:08,998 --> 01:34:12,747
I see we took our happy pill today.
Danny.

803
01:34:14,003 --> 01:34:15,794
He said hello to me.

804
01:34:16,297 --> 01:34:18,918
I ignored him, so guess what he does.

805
01:34:19,050 --> 01:34:24,257
He starts screaming at the top
of his lungs. "Hello! Hello!"

806
01:34:24,389 --> 01:34:27,425
Like a lunatic.
I got the hell out of there.

807
01:34:27,517 --> 01:34:31,051
That guy is a maniac.

808
01:34:31,145 --> 01:34:38,358
Do you think he was hitting on me?
To get back at you.

809
01:34:40,405 --> 01:34:42,942
Speak of the devil.

810
01:34:47,620 --> 01:34:51,036
Stop following me. I don't want
to start drinking in the suburbs.

811
01:34:51,165 --> 01:34:55,033
- I love you.
- Let's not get corny.

812
01:34:55,169 --> 01:34:58,704
- I love you.
- I'm going home.

813
01:35:04,137 --> 01:35:07,671
- Just get away from me.
- I love you.

814
01:35:07,807 --> 01:35:10,678
When we were together
you couldn't say it.

815
01:35:10,810 --> 01:35:15,187
- I did say it.
- Once. You didn't even mean it.

816
01:35:15,314 --> 01:35:18,648
- I did. I love you.
- It will pass.

817
01:35:19,652 --> 01:35:23,187
- I miss you. I miss what we had.
- We had nothing.

818
01:35:23,322 --> 01:35:29,990
- It's not true. It was the best.
- We had nothing. We had good sex.

819
01:35:30,872 --> 01:35:34,075
Don't say that. I love you.

820
01:35:35,376 --> 01:35:39,208
Bullshit. You don't know what love is.

821
01:35:39,338 --> 01:35:41,461
You've got everything
you've always wanted -

822
01:35:41,591 --> 01:35:45,375
- but now there's something you want
that you can't have.

823
01:35:45,511 --> 01:35:49,924
But you had it. I gave you love.
But you asked me to leave.

824
01:35:50,058 --> 01:35:52,809
Let's talk about it.

825
01:35:55,229 --> 01:36:01,102
It took me a long time to get over it,
and it was so hard.

826
01:36:02,779 --> 01:36:06,990
Dan, get on with your life.
It's over.

827
01:37:21,983 --> 01:37:27,439
Mr Martin. So nice of you to show up.
The Prince of Plates is here.

828
01:37:43,463 --> 01:37:48,171
Vic, come on, where are you going.
We're going to get you home.

829
01:37:48,301 --> 01:37:50,708
Get him a cab.

830
01:37:50,845 --> 01:37:54,380
- Give me a gin and tonic.
- Last call was half an hour ago.

831
01:37:54,515 --> 01:37:59,094
- Give me one or I'll kill you.
- Just one.

832
01:38:02,774 --> 01:38:08,894
I've always wanted to do this. I'd like
to buy the house a round of drinks.

833
01:38:10,031 --> 01:38:14,574
And I didn't think you had
a decent bone in your entire body.

834
01:38:14,702 --> 01:38:18,570
- Leave my bone out of this.
- You're a filthy scumbag.

835
01:38:18,706 --> 01:38:21,458
And you dress for shit.

836
01:38:23,294 --> 01:38:27,541
A toast to Danny and Debbie.

837
01:38:31,886 --> 01:38:34,970
- They're better off anyway.
- Fuckin' A.

838
01:38:35,431 --> 01:38:39,844
- She's happy, right? So is he.
- Ecstatic.

839
01:38:40,853 --> 01:38:45,100
- I bet she starts banging her boss.
- I bet he catches a disease.

840
01:38:47,110 --> 01:38:48,853
You know what?

841
01:38:48,986 --> 01:38:52,071
If you didn't have a pussy
there'd be a bounty on your head.

842
01:38:52,532 --> 01:38:58,368
You're a psychopathic, schizophrenic,
maladjusted social misfit -

843
01:38:58,496 --> 01:39:04,036
- clearly in the middle
of a deep homosexual panic.

844
01:39:05,753 --> 01:39:08,838
So you want to dance or what?

845
01:40:05,313 --> 01:40:08,267
- I love it.
- To you, this is culture.

846
01:40:08,399 --> 01:40:11,186
To me, it's soda pop.

847
01:40:12,070 --> 01:40:14,774
Everyone said you were dead.
They said -

848
01:40:14,906 --> 01:40:18,855
- "Dan is dead", but I said "No, no".

849
01:40:18,993 --> 01:40:22,409
"He was my best friend.
He would've called me for the funeral."

850
01:40:23,206 --> 01:40:27,334
- Hello, Litko.
- Shut up and cut the small talk.

851
01:40:29,212 --> 01:40:32,996
I have a deal for you.
I have some tall fountain glasses.

852
01:40:34,133 --> 01:40:35,877
Where did you find those?

853
01:40:36,010 --> 01:40:41,633
I have matching banana boats.
And take a fucking look at this.

854
01:40:41,849 --> 01:40:47,804
A shitload of Fiestaware.
All yours at the low Litko discount.

855
01:40:48,147 --> 01:40:52,192
- How much?
- 100% off.

856
01:40:52,610 --> 01:40:57,568
- Bernie, I can't do that.
- Come on, I can't do better than that.

857
01:40:57,865 --> 01:41:00,439
- I can't.
- I stole it.

858
01:41:00,576 --> 01:41:02,735
You did not.

859
01:41:02,870 --> 01:41:06,571
I tell you I'm a thief,
and you call me a liar.

860
01:41:06,707 --> 01:41:09,377
Nice guy. What's this?

861
01:41:09,502 --> 01:41:13,452
A menu? A pink menu?

862
01:41:23,433 --> 01:41:28,011
$4.95 for a burger?
I can get one down the street for $1.50.

863
01:41:28,187 --> 01:41:32,980
No parking.
You won't catch me around here.

864
01:41:33,109 --> 01:41:37,854
Awnings. Nice touch, Danny.
The place ought to do okay.

865
01:41:38,030 --> 01:41:41,814
You'll meet a nice girl,
settle down, get married.

866
01:41:41,951 --> 01:41:44,620
She'll divorce you and take your money.

867
01:41:45,580 --> 01:41:47,987
"You learn from your mistakes."

868
01:41:48,124 --> 01:41:52,501
"Man is the one animal
that has that capacity."

869
01:41:52,920 --> 01:41:57,962
"And in the end, what do you have?
You have your friends."

870
01:41:58,092 --> 01:42:03,003
It's not really therapy.
It's like a workshop.

871
01:42:03,139 --> 01:42:08,015
Don't you think it's about time
you tried helping yourself?

872
01:42:08,144 --> 01:42:11,762
It's not me helping myself.
It's you helping myself.

873
01:42:11,898 --> 01:42:18,150
This workshop was made for you.
A weekend dealing with rage and anger.

874
01:42:18,279 --> 01:42:23,819
With men and women. Sharing.
Working out their hate.

875
01:42:23,910 --> 01:42:27,113
I'm sick of hating.
Don't you understand?

876
01:42:27,246 --> 01:42:33,367
- I don't think I have any hate left.
- Yes, you do. You just don't know it.

877
01:42:33,461 --> 01:42:39,795
Just wait a second.
I'll tell you something about yourself.

878
01:42:39,884 --> 01:42:42,838
You and this psycho-babble
are full of shit.

879
01:42:42,970 --> 01:42:46,968
You did everything
in your power to break us up.

880
01:42:47,100 --> 01:42:49,637
Don't you dare tell me about friendship.

881
01:42:55,942 --> 01:42:59,809
I'm such a bitch.

882
01:43:00,738 --> 01:43:04,818
How do you put up with me?

883
01:43:04,951 --> 01:43:08,367
If I didn't love you so much,
I'd throw you out the window.

884
01:43:15,461 --> 01:43:20,123
Will you look at those nipples?
T-shirt, blue shorts.

885
01:43:20,258 --> 01:43:24,469
Are you fucking kidding me?
Are you pulling my leg?

886
01:43:24,679 --> 01:43:29,804
- That is a sensitive lady.
- I think I can see her beaver.

887
01:43:30,268 --> 01:43:33,103
- I'm telling you.
- Get out of here.

888
01:43:34,355 --> 01:43:37,439
- See?
- I can't make it out.

889
01:43:37,775 --> 01:43:42,022
- When she bends over. Top of her legs.
- I know where it is!

890
01:43:42,155 --> 01:43:44,824
You have to look really close.

891
01:43:48,035 --> 01:43:53,326
That fucking pisses me off.
How does she get off with that?

892
01:43:53,791 --> 01:43:58,952
Coming to the ballpark.
Flaunting her body.

893
01:43:59,088 --> 01:44:04,593
What's a fellow to think?
A fellow comes here to play ball, right?

894
01:44:04,719 --> 01:44:09,215
We're talking about space.
Recreational fucking space!

895
01:44:09,348 --> 01:44:13,477
- Are you alright?
- Do I look alright?

896
01:44:13,603 --> 01:44:18,561
- You look fine.
- Then let's assume I'm alright.

897
01:44:23,821 --> 01:44:28,033
Look at those ...
Shit. It's what's-her-name.

898
01:44:34,248 --> 01:44:38,080
Pretend you don't see her.
Don't look at her.

899
01:44:44,801 --> 01:44:47,588
- Now she sees you.
- For Christ's sake.

900
01:44:47,720 --> 01:44:53,675
The way I see it, either you can
stay here and keep blaming me -

901
01:44:57,563 --> 01:45:02,391
- or go talk to him
and only have yourself to blame.

902
01:45:10,660 --> 01:45:12,783
Perfect.

903
01:45:27,468 --> 01:45:31,513
- Could you excuse us?
- Sure, go ahead.

904
01:45:31,639 --> 01:45:36,100
- Come on, man.
- Don't be a jerk your whole life.

905
01:45:37,270 --> 01:45:40,271
She said don't be an asshole.

906
01:45:40,398 --> 01:45:44,265
You're trying ... you want to talk.
Go ahead.

907
01:45:44,402 --> 01:45:48,980
Want a hot dog?
Deb, you want a hot Italian sausage?

908
01:45:57,790 --> 01:46:03,414
- How have you been?
- Great. You look great.

909
01:46:04,714 --> 01:46:07,964
Thanks. So do you.

910
01:46:15,391 --> 01:46:20,137
- I'm sorry things got so screwed up.
- I'm sorry, too.

911
01:46:24,901 --> 01:46:29,029
That's really all I wanted to say.

912
01:46:33,451 --> 01:46:39,038
- We really ripped it to shreds.
- It wasn't that bad.

913
01:46:40,166 --> 01:46:45,291
As bad as it got, I really think
it was the best thing around.

914
01:46:47,590 --> 01:46:53,011
I thought it was to be the way
it was with my parents.

915
01:46:53,096 --> 01:46:57,176
I just wish I hadn't pushed.
Maybe if we'd gone slower ...

916
01:46:57,308 --> 01:47:00,060
No, it was me.

917
01:47:01,771 --> 01:47:07,275
- I thought it would be different ...
- Than what it was really like.

918
01:47:07,402 --> 01:47:11,862
Me, too.
Maybe we were just too naive.

919
01:47:13,783 --> 01:47:19,868
- Maybe we knew too much.
- That, too.

920
01:47:21,582 --> 01:47:26,825
But how can you be against freedom?
Freedom's good.

921
01:47:30,675 --> 01:47:34,091
You have to believe in something.

922
01:47:37,682 --> 01:47:43,518
I want you to know that when we were
together ... I was really happy.

923
01:47:53,322 --> 01:47:55,149
I've got to go.

924
01:47:59,787 --> 01:48:04,496
- Could we have dinner sometime?
- Yeah, we could.

925
01:48:08,045 --> 01:48:12,292
My roommate is going
out of town for the weekend -

926
01:48:12,425 --> 01:48:16,090
- and I don't have any special
plans for tonight even.

927
01:48:16,220 --> 01:48:19,672
If you were in the neighbourhood,
we could do Chinese or something.

928
01:48:19,807 --> 01:48:25,050
- I know a great new restaurant.
- Let's just go to some old joint.

929
01:48:25,605 --> 01:48:29,270
It's not new.
It's an old joint that's been re ...

930
01:48:45,666 --> 01:48:48,870
Let's sit with this a while.

931
01:48:49,378 --> 01:48:52,083
I'll ride off into the sunset.

932
01:48:52,757 --> 01:48:57,170
- Mind if I watch?
- I was hoping you would.

933
01:49:00,306 --> 01:49:04,635
I can't believe we're doing this.
Why are we doing this?

934
01:49:13,277 --> 01:49:16,777
Boy, she had a bug up her ass.

935
01:49:22,495 --> 01:49:27,371
I'm going to stick around all day
with that face, with that attitude?

936
01:49:27,500 --> 01:49:31,961
You're no good to the team.
Get lost ... Come on, go home.

937
01:49:45,226 --> 01:49:47,598
Isn't this a coincidence.

938
01:49:47,728 --> 01:49:50,302
I was thinking ...

939
01:49:50,773 --> 01:49:52,433
What?
