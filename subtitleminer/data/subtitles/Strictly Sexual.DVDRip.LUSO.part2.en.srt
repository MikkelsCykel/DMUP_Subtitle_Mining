00:00:03,523 --> 00:00:05,582
Donna, you've read me all wrong.

2
00:00:05,792 --> 00:00:08,386
I wasn't trying to hit you up
for a loan.

3
00:00:16,769 --> 00:00:18,760
I know you weren't.

4
00:00:21,307 --> 00:00:22,569
Look, Christi Ann,
your store does well...

5
00:00:22,775 --> 00:00:25,073
and if that rep knows
what she's talking about, then...

6
00:00:25,278 --> 00:00:28,304
it's not a favor.
It's a good investment.

7
00:00:32,685 --> 00:00:34,380
Are you serious?

8
00:00:36,355 --> 00:00:38,118
Okay.

9
00:00:38,324 --> 00:00:40,417
Yeah, let's do it.

10
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:42,493
But you have to promise me
you'll finish that script...

11
00:00:42,695 --> 00:00:45,323
and start sending it out.
No more excuses.

12
00:00:46,566 --> 00:00:49,399
- Okay.
- Okay.

13
00:00:52,138 --> 00:00:54,197
Gee, this is crazy. Why am I gonna
show my new men's clothes?

14
00:00:54,407 --> 00:00:56,068
I just started making these.

15
00:00:56,275 --> 00:00:57,936
- They look great to me.
- Thank you.

16
00:00:58,144 --> 00:01:01,511
Alright, the word's out, lots of buzz.
All the critics are gonna be there...

17
00:01:01,714 --> 00:01:03,306
mostly because of the celebrities.

18
00:01:03,516 --> 00:01:05,575
You know, I'm not sure
who I hate more frankly.

19
00:01:05,785 --> 00:01:10,381
Actually, no, that's not true. I hate
them all. But I do love this dress.

20
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:13,119
Please tell me
you're sleeping with him.

21
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:16,927
- No, he's just an employee.
- Put him on the runway.

22
00:01:17,196 --> 00:01:19,323
- Well, I don't know if I'm...
- No, you have to.

23
00:01:19,532 --> 00:01:20,658
It'll be a fun surprise.

24
00:01:20,867 --> 00:01:24,735
Think about it: hot new designer
puts warehouse boy on catwalk.

25
00:01:24,937 --> 00:01:29,431
It's brilliant. It's a tease.
Leave them wanting more. I gotta go.

26
00:01:32,912 --> 00:01:36,245
- This is the last box.
- Will you do me a favor?

27
00:01:36,983 --> 00:01:38,917
Will you try this on?

28
00:01:47,293 --> 00:01:52,026
I wish I was as confident as you look.
Will you model this for me?

29
00:01:55,034 --> 00:01:58,060
Yeah, sure. Why not?

30
00:01:58,671 --> 00:02:02,801
Thank God. I need as many pillars
of strength around me as possible.

31
00:02:03,009 --> 00:02:06,206
Christi Ann, this looks fine.

32
00:02:06,712 --> 00:02:09,806
Hey, come on now.

33
00:02:10,616 --> 00:02:13,483
This is all good.
It's exciting!

34
00:02:13,686 --> 00:02:16,246
Look, no matter what
the critical people say...

35
00:02:17,657 --> 00:02:20,182
might as well enjoy
what's going on.

36
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:23,228
Come here.

37
00:02:43,816 --> 00:02:46,182
<i>- You got brothers and sisters?
- Yeah.</i>

38
00:02:47,987 --> 00:02:50,615
I mean, I got a brother
and I got a sister.

39
00:02:51,224 --> 00:02:55,718
- Older, younger?
- One's older, one's younger.

40
00:02:56,062 --> 00:02:57,689
Why do people always ask this?
I don't...

41
00:02:57,897 --> 00:02:59,797
Who cares about
somebody's brothers and sisters?

42
00:02:59,999 --> 00:03:03,935
- Do you talk to your parents a lot?
- No. We got an understanding.

43
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:06,235
What kind of understanding?

44
00:03:06,806 --> 00:03:10,139
I left when I was 17.
I gave them one of these.

45
00:03:11,978 --> 00:03:14,037
What's that?
What does that mean?

46
00:03:15,381 --> 00:03:18,544
My mom and dad weren't
very bright people.

47
00:03:18,751 --> 00:03:19,740
Which would've been okay
if they were nice...

48
00:03:19,952 --> 00:03:22,386
I mean, there's plenty of dumb
but sweet people in the world.

49
00:03:22,588 --> 00:03:26,422
But, I don't know, they were shitty
too. They were just mean people.

50
00:03:28,094 --> 00:03:31,154
- How were they mean?
- They just always said mean things.

51
00:03:31,364 --> 00:03:37,234
You know, told me I was a fucking liar
and a goddamned bullshiter.

52
00:03:37,837 --> 00:03:41,273
I go to a therapist. I've been going
for three years actually and...

53
00:03:41,474 --> 00:03:46,605
I've learned that you have to move on,
that you have to forgive them.

54
00:03:46,812 --> 00:03:48,677
Right, yeah.

55
00:03:49,649 --> 00:03:53,085
I mean, I forgive them. Like I say,
they weren't bright people.

56
00:03:53,286 --> 00:03:56,255
They had me.
They didn't abort me.

57
00:03:56,455 --> 00:04:00,221
I mean, they raised me, kind of
a fucked up way to do it, but...

58
00:04:00,426 --> 00:04:03,088
maybe them being so harsh
made me the way I am today...

59
00:04:03,296 --> 00:04:05,093
you know, like resilient?

60
00:04:06,966 --> 00:04:08,866
Gotta thank them for that, huh?

61
00:04:09,068 --> 00:04:12,401
Yeah, so whatever.
That's why I gave them one of these.

62
00:04:13,906 --> 00:04:15,897
'Cause what it means is...

63
00:04:16,208 --> 00:04:18,768
you did your best to love me.
I did my best to love you back.

64
00:04:18,978 --> 00:04:23,142
We just reached a point where
there's nothing left to say, so...

65
00:04:23,783 --> 00:04:27,583
...good luck.
- I like how you explain things.

66
00:04:29,355 --> 00:04:31,084
You ever thought about writing?

67
00:04:33,459 --> 00:04:35,393
- Me?
- Seriously.

68
00:04:35,594 --> 00:04:37,619
- Come on!
- Seriously.

69
00:04:38,597 --> 00:04:41,395
Seriously. You definitely
have a way with words.

70
00:04:42,001 --> 00:04:45,027
I think you should write stuff
down, you know? Not to...

71
00:04:45,237 --> 00:04:48,365
not to be rich or famous
or anything, but to...

72
00:04:49,675 --> 00:04:51,666
to express yourself.

73
00:04:55,481 --> 00:04:57,608
I'm gonna get you a notebook
and a pen. Just try it.

74
00:04:57,817 --> 00:04:59,580
Just jot stuff down.

75
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,616
Okay, yeah.

76
00:05:10,262 --> 00:05:12,127
Good luck with the show.
We can't wait to see it.

77
00:05:12,331 --> 00:05:14,492
Thank you.
See you on the front row!

78
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,327
Thanks.

79
00:05:18,637 --> 00:05:21,128
"See you on the front row"?
How ass-kissy was that?

80
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:22,705
Honey, you don't even
need to be kissing her ass.

81
00:05:22,908 --> 00:05:26,071
She's just a manufacturer.
I gotta go.

82
00:05:35,921 --> 00:05:37,513
- Thanks for coming.
- Sure.

83
00:05:37,723 --> 00:05:40,715
You know, I think you're
making me addicted to sex.

84
00:05:40,926 --> 00:05:42,291
Thanks.

85
00:05:43,629 --> 00:05:45,688
And, you know, I've never...

86
00:05:46,799 --> 00:05:50,166
given a blowjob to a guy in a car.

87
00:05:50,403 --> 00:05:53,895
I'm just gonna... I just wanna...

88
00:06:00,746 --> 00:06:04,182
You've gotten really good at that.

89
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,913
When you're through with that can
you please call the silk place back...

90
00:06:10,122 --> 00:06:13,091
and tell them that you're
repped by me? They'll knock off 20/º.

91
00:06:26,672 --> 00:06:28,469
Where is everybody?

92
00:06:28,674 --> 00:06:30,505
Joe's helping out Christi Ann
at her store.

93
00:06:30,709 --> 00:06:33,906
Good. Did you get
any writing done today?

94
00:06:34,113 --> 00:06:37,480
- Yeah, yeah, no, it's really cool.
- So what you writing about?

95
00:06:40,052 --> 00:06:42,714
Never mind.
Just keep getting it down on paper.

96
00:06:42,922 --> 00:06:44,253
Okay.

97
00:06:44,457 --> 00:06:47,187
Had the printer print up like
100 copies of my script today.

98
00:06:47,393 --> 00:06:49,122
Getting ready to send it out
to agents.

99
00:06:49,328 --> 00:06:51,159
- Great.
- Tell you what...

100
00:06:51,464 --> 00:06:55,696
when you're ready to take a break,
why don't you come inside?

101
00:06:55,901 --> 00:06:57,994
Okay. I will.

102
00:08:19,718 --> 00:08:24,781
I'm sorry! I know, I'm a bad little slut
and you're the big strong man!

103
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:27,083
That's right.
I'm not done fucking you.

104
00:08:27,293 --> 00:08:29,124
I'm gonna fuck you harder
and you're gonna like it.

105
00:08:29,328 --> 00:08:32,559
Oh, no, no!

106
00:08:34,733 --> 00:08:36,860
Don't punish me! Hey!

107
00:08:38,804 --> 00:08:42,900
- Baby, I can't do this anymore.
- Why? What's wrong?

108
00:08:43,108 --> 00:08:47,875
This... this whole routine
of me holding you down and...

109
00:08:48,247 --> 00:08:50,807
your begging me to stop...

110
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:53,311
it's fucking weird, I don't know.
It's just...

111
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:57,080
Well, you seemed to enjoy it just fine
every day for the past three weeks.

112
00:08:57,289 --> 00:09:00,918
I know. Look, at first I did.
It's just lately...

113
00:09:02,027 --> 00:09:05,190
It's 'cause I care about you,
and I don't wanna do that...

114
00:09:05,397 --> 00:09:08,798
...to somebody I care about.
- Look, we're just playing. Come on.

115
00:09:09,001 --> 00:09:10,593
I mean, we're just...

116
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:13,565
Why are we even having
this conversation?

117
00:09:13,772 --> 00:09:15,034
You have a simple job, Stanny.

118
00:09:15,241 --> 00:09:17,709
Are you telling me that you can't
fulfill it? Because, you know what?

119
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:20,674
There are a lot of guys in this city
that would be more than happy...

120
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:23,040
to do this without complaining.

121
00:09:25,718 --> 00:09:27,549
Are you fucking kidding me?

122
00:09:28,687 --> 00:09:30,917
Is that all that I am to you?

123
00:09:32,424 --> 00:09:36,417
I think you'd better
take the blindfold off now.

124
00:09:48,474 --> 00:09:50,772
I'm such a fucking idiot.

125
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:53,171
I'm an asshole.

126
00:09:53,912 --> 00:09:56,642
I mean, I was like ready to tell...

127
00:09:56,849 --> 00:09:58,282
What?

128
00:10:02,755 --> 00:10:05,724
I think I'm falling
in love with you.

129
00:10:14,967 --> 00:10:17,731
Okay. Can you untie me, please?

130
00:10:52,805 --> 00:10:55,000
I think you and Joe
need to move out.

131
00:11:07,586 --> 00:11:09,645
Joe, get up. We gotta go.

132
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:13,815
Seriously. I'm not fucking
around, man. Pack your shit.

133
00:11:14,026 --> 00:11:16,358
Stanny, what did you do?

134
00:11:16,562 --> 00:11:19,963
I didn't do anything shitty. I stopped
being shitty. Figure that one out.

135
00:11:20,165 --> 00:11:23,032
Come on, we got a pretty good deal
going on here, man.

136
00:11:23,235 --> 00:11:25,965
How long did you think this was
gonna last, you know, seriously?

137
00:11:26,171 --> 00:11:27,729
Okay, it's been a fun month
or two, but...

138
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:30,807
we milked this for as much
as we could. The milk's gone sour.

139
00:11:49,595 --> 00:11:52,894
What did you?
Joe, what the hell's going on?

140
00:11:53,098 --> 00:11:54,656
- We're leaving.
- Hold on!

141
00:11:54,867 --> 00:11:58,303
- Did you get in a fight with Donna?
- What the fuck you think?

142
00:11:58,504 --> 00:12:01,996
I guess we're gonna go and try
and find our own place.

143
00:12:02,207 --> 00:12:04,573
No, I don't want you to go.
I don't want either one of you to go.

144
00:12:04,777 --> 00:12:05,937
Well, you don't always get
what you want.

145
00:12:06,145 --> 00:12:08,511
- Take care.
- Wait! Wait!

146
00:12:08,714 --> 00:12:11,274
Hold on one minute!

147
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:13,815
Hold on.

148
00:12:20,392 --> 00:12:24,055
- Donna, what's going on?
- I guess they're leaving.

149
00:12:24,263 --> 00:12:25,355
And you're just gonna sit there?

150
00:12:25,564 --> 00:12:27,759
Yeah,
what am I supposed to be doing?

151
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:30,500
What happened?

152
00:12:30,702 --> 00:12:32,932
It was just getting too...

153
00:12:33,605 --> 00:12:36,438
...I don't know, too weird.
- Too weird?

154
00:12:36,642 --> 00:12:39,668
Why is it that every time you like
a guy things get too weird?

155
00:12:39,878 --> 00:12:42,608
- Who says I like the guy?
- You're full of shit.

156
00:12:42,815 --> 00:12:45,147
And I don't have time to sit here
and listen to you lie to yourself...

157
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:48,285
because they're leaving!
What do you wanna do?

158
00:12:49,388 --> 00:12:52,414
- Well, Joe doesn't have to go.
- Joe goes wherever Stanny goes!

159
00:12:52,624 --> 00:12:56,151
And I'm not about to let him do that
because you got this thing about...

160
00:12:56,361 --> 00:12:57,487
What? This thing about what?

161
00:12:57,696 --> 00:12:59,596
I don't know,
but you've got this thing!

162
00:13:00,032 --> 00:13:01,431
And...

163
00:13:03,235 --> 00:13:06,966
if you look at me and tell me
that you don't like the guy...

164
00:13:07,406 --> 00:13:11,467
fine, I'll say goodbye
to both of them.

165
00:13:17,549 --> 00:13:19,983
Tell me what happened.

166
00:13:21,487 --> 00:13:25,389
He said he thought
he was falling in love with me.

167
00:13:26,558 --> 00:13:29,652
Okay. Well...

168
00:13:30,128 --> 00:13:34,224
the guy who loves you
is walking out the door right now.

169
00:13:34,566 --> 00:13:37,364
Is that what you want?

170
00:13:41,907 --> 00:13:43,898
Let's get out of here.
This is friggin' humiliating.

171
00:13:44,109 --> 00:13:47,567
She asked us to wait a minute,
so we're gonna wait.

172
00:13:48,013 --> 00:13:51,779
- It's been over a minute. Let's go.
- It's an expression, Stanny.

173
00:13:51,984 --> 00:13:54,316
Okay? It's like "hold on a sec".
It's more than a second.

174
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,988
Okay, it's a stupid fucking
expression then.

175
00:14:04,496 --> 00:14:05,986
Just...

176
00:14:06,265 --> 00:14:08,699
don't ask me to say it to you
'cause I can't, Stanny. I'm sorry.

177
00:14:08,901 --> 00:14:15,329
- I just can't say it to you.
- Just... just let me love you.

178
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:00,710
I was close.

179
00:15:01,386 --> 00:15:03,718
It's alright.

180
00:15:03,922 --> 00:15:08,120
I'm sorry. My mind's just
on the fashion show.

181
00:15:08,827 --> 00:15:11,853
Don't be sorry.

182
00:15:12,397 --> 00:15:16,993
Joe, how come you never
slept in my bed?

183
00:15:19,338 --> 00:15:22,535
You never asked me to.

184
00:15:22,741 --> 00:15:27,110
Well, will you sleep here with me?
I mean...

185
00:15:28,413 --> 00:15:33,180
just for the next two nights
until the fashion show.

186
00:15:36,154 --> 00:15:37,849
Well...

187
00:15:38,657 --> 00:15:40,784
sure, girl.

188
00:15:41,893 --> 00:15:44,521
Be happy to.

189
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:05,438
- What about the cuteness?
- What about the dumbness?

190
00:16:05,651 --> 00:16:07,710
- You're dumb.
- No, you're dumb.

191
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:12,481
- What about the sweetness?
- Guys, do it in private! Jeez!

192
00:16:12,691 --> 00:16:13,680
You guys, really.

193
00:16:13,892 --> 00:16:15,757
Why don't you just
give each other hickies?

194
00:16:15,961 --> 00:16:17,861
You have rug burns on your elbows.

195
00:16:18,063 --> 00:16:20,258
You broke your nails
scratching his back!

196
00:16:20,465 --> 00:16:21,989
I chipped my tooth last week...

197
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,326
'cause we were doing it
doggy style...

198
00:16:23,535 --> 00:16:27,938
and she friggin' jerks her head
back right into my jaw. You did!

199
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:31,371
My God, Christi Ann!
Remember back in college...

200
00:16:31,576 --> 00:16:34,067
when I was giving a blowjob
to that guy...

201
00:16:34,279 --> 00:16:35,712
that would not take the beret off?

202
00:16:35,914 --> 00:16:38,781
My God. the bathroom is in-between
our two bedrooms...

203
00:16:38,984 --> 00:16:40,542
which is right next to this
little tiny living room.

204
00:16:40,752 --> 00:16:42,549
So I'm ready
to come out and spit...

205
00:16:42,754 --> 00:16:45,917
and there's like ten people
in the goddamned living room.

206
00:16:46,124 --> 00:16:50,060
So I come out and my mouth's like
this 'caused it's all full of his cum.

207
00:16:50,262 --> 00:16:52,822
And I come out and
everybody starts laughing.

208
00:16:53,031 --> 00:16:54,726
And then I start to laugh...

209
00:16:54,933 --> 00:16:56,628
and then everyone's jumping back
out of the way...

210
00:16:56,835 --> 00:16:59,770
'cause they're like terrified I'm gonna
spit up right there on the carpet.

211
00:16:59,971 --> 00:17:03,270
So I got running into the bathroom
and I spit out and...

212
00:17:03,575 --> 00:17:05,873
I get a standing ovation.

213
00:17:06,978 --> 00:17:09,674
That's disgusting. Ew!

214
00:17:17,456 --> 00:17:19,481
Honey, you know
what I was just thinking?

215
00:17:19,691 --> 00:17:22,990
- How adorable you are?
- No, I think pretty highly on myself...

216
00:17:23,195 --> 00:17:25,220
but I ain't best described
as adorable.

217
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:27,295
No, I was thinking about
how we first met and all.

218
00:17:27,499 --> 00:17:28,591
It's funny, I used to be
so choosey.

219
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,826
Like every girl I dates
had to have a perfect ass.

220
00:17:32,037 --> 00:17:33,299
Joe and I used to argue
about it all the time.

221
00:17:33,505 --> 00:17:35,666
If the girl had like
a big square man ass...

222
00:17:35,874 --> 00:17:38,468
forget it. I couldn't do it.
And it's funny when I met you...

223
00:17:38,677 --> 00:17:42,135
I was like, "This chick is hot-looking,
but what does her ass look like?

224
00:17:42,347 --> 00:17:43,837
So we get naked
and we start fucking...

225
00:17:44,049 --> 00:17:46,517
And I'm like,
"Wow, this chick has a big ass!

226
00:17:46,718 --> 00:17:50,245
But I'm diggin' it. It's great."
It's like you converted me.

227
00:17:50,455 --> 00:17:54,391
Now I'm like all the black and Puerto
Rican guys I used to give shit to...

228
00:17:54,593 --> 00:17:58,723
'cause they always went for the
big booty. I love big asses now.

229
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:01,797
It's weird how like your taste
could change like that.

230
00:18:03,635 --> 00:18:05,796
How about how adorable you are?

231
00:18:06,004 --> 00:18:08,063
Don't fuckin' touch me. I cannot
believe you just told me I was fat.

232
00:18:08,273 --> 00:18:09,262
I didn't say you were fat!

233
00:18:09,474 --> 00:18:12,466
I said I love you no matter
what your body looks like.

234
00:18:14,446 --> 00:18:17,506
Another sacrifice to the beer gods.

235
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:24,584
Man, Donna's making me insane.

236
00:18:25,824 --> 00:18:29,817
Yep. Well, you're in love with her.

237
00:18:30,028 --> 00:18:33,759
Yeah. Still, she's got
some mental problems.

238
00:18:34,266 --> 00:18:36,700
Women just have
more emotions than we do.

239
00:18:36,902 --> 00:18:40,201
And they don't think of all the things
they're thinking as mental problems.

240
00:18:40,405 --> 00:18:42,339
That's just their
daily way of thinking.

241
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:46,739
And he repeats himself. I think
he's borderline schizophrenic.

242
00:18:47,379 --> 00:18:50,644
We argue and I explain to him
how he's being ridiculous.

243
00:18:50,849 --> 00:18:51,838
He admits it.

244
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:54,518
He apologizes for it and then he does
it again the very next day!

245
00:18:54,719 --> 00:18:55,708
Well, what're you arguing about?

246
00:18:55,921 --> 00:18:57,218
It just depends on what
you're fighting about.

247
00:18:57,422 --> 00:19:00,186
It has nothing to do
with what you were fighting about.

248
00:19:00,392 --> 00:19:02,383
She always gives me this
psycho-friggin'-logical bullshit...

249
00:19:02,594 --> 00:19:04,152
I ain't in touch with my feelings.

250
00:19:04,462 --> 00:19:07,124
After about an hour of yelling, I just
say, "Yeah, whatever. You're right".

251
00:19:07,332 --> 00:19:09,857
And then the next day we have the
same argument like a bad rerun!

252
00:19:10,068 --> 00:19:12,764
You're lucky.
Joe seems a lot more sensitive.

253
00:19:12,971 --> 00:19:15,201
- He tries.
- Yeah, he tries.

254
00:19:15,407 --> 00:19:17,932
Bro, just make it look like
you're trying. Don't say nothing.

255
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:21,772
At most just say, "I wish
I was more aware like you guys.

256
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:25,882
- But I'm still learning".
- He says that? That is so sweet!

257
00:19:26,685 --> 00:19:29,745
And Stanny can be so great.
I mean, he really can.

258
00:19:29,955 --> 00:19:35,291
And that's why it kills me
to get rejected like that.

259
00:19:35,493 --> 00:19:38,087
What does she expect me to say?
I feel like saying to her...

260
00:19:38,463 --> 00:19:41,455
"All those years shoveling concrete
I had a lot of shitty days.

261
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:44,362
Would've been really nice to just
lay on a couch on a doctor's office...

262
00:19:44,569 --> 00:19:46,901
and talk about my feelings".
It ain't fair!

263
00:19:47,105 --> 00:19:49,596
I worked so hard
to get to this point.

264
00:19:49,808 --> 00:19:51,935
My therapist is so proud
of my progress.

265
00:19:52,143 --> 00:19:54,168
But this whole relationship
is putting me in a tailspin.

266
00:19:54,379 --> 00:19:56,609
You're not thinking of breaking up
with him, are you?

267
00:19:56,815 --> 00:20:01,013
No! Well, thinking about it
but no, I mean...

268
00:20:01,219 --> 00:20:03,744
we've come this far and
we should try and get through this.

269
00:20:03,955 --> 00:20:05,946
You ever cry in front of her?

270
00:20:06,258 --> 00:20:07,748
No.

271
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,326
You don't cry ever, do you?

272
00:20:11,663 --> 00:20:13,528
No.

273
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:21,334
You ever cry in front of Donna?

274
00:20:23,408 --> 00:20:25,433
Yeah, I suppose. This once.

275
00:20:26,344 --> 00:20:27,971
And he cries.

276
00:20:28,179 --> 00:20:30,340
- Really?
- He cries a lot, actually.

277
00:20:30,548 --> 00:20:32,072
And more and more lately.

278
00:20:32,784 --> 00:20:34,843
Joe doesn't cry
in front of you, huh?

279
00:20:35,453 --> 00:20:37,614
Well, no.

280
00:20:37,822 --> 00:20:42,259
Just take it in a notch, Stanny.
I know you, man, you don't let shit go.

281
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:45,120
- This chick could turn on you.
- No.

282
00:20:45,363 --> 00:20:48,389
You kidding me?
This chick is crazy about me.

283
00:20:49,167 --> 00:20:50,498
You really love her, don't you?

284
00:20:52,938 --> 00:20:55,668
Joe, I never loved nothing
like I love that girl.

285
00:20:55,874 --> 00:21:01,141
Joe is... he'll open up. He's the type
of guy who grows on you.

286
00:21:01,346 --> 00:21:02,574
He's somebody you
fall in love with slowly.

287
00:21:02,948 --> 00:21:03,937
Love him like a friend.

288
00:21:04,149 --> 00:21:05,480
You don't say "I love you"
to each other?

289
00:21:05,684 --> 00:21:07,709
- No! You don't say that to friends.
- Yes, you do. We do.

290
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:10,217
- I mean, you know I love you.
- I love you too!

291
00:21:10,422 --> 00:21:13,448
- But guys don't say that as friends.
- You're right.

292
00:21:13,658 --> 00:21:17,219
- Joe, I fucking love you, man.
- I love you too, bro.

293
00:21:34,779 --> 00:21:36,940
Christi Ann...

294
00:21:37,482 --> 00:21:40,246
you gotta relax.

295
00:21:41,219 --> 00:21:44,552
I want you to know something, okay?

296
00:21:45,423 --> 00:21:48,153
Sex isn't about...

297
00:21:48,693 --> 00:21:50,888
talking dirty or...

298
00:21:51,096 --> 00:21:53,929
some silly new position.

299
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:57,927
It's about trust.

300
00:21:59,437 --> 00:22:01,769
Do you trust me?

301
00:22:06,011 --> 00:22:07,740
It's tender...

302
00:22:09,114 --> 00:22:10,775
soft.

303
00:22:12,017 --> 00:22:14,781
I'm gonna kiss you delicately.

304
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:19,384
If it makes sense, give it back.

305
00:23:43,641 --> 00:23:46,940
This is going to be a great show.

306
00:23:52,050 --> 00:23:53,881
Yeah, it is.

307
00:24:53,044 --> 00:24:56,241
- You're amazing. Okay.
- Thank you.

308
00:24:57,315 --> 00:24:59,010
This is insane!

309
00:25:05,056 --> 00:25:06,148
I think you're gonna get backers.

310
00:25:06,357 --> 00:25:08,882
I've gotten so many cards
I can't even keep track!

311
00:25:09,093 --> 00:25:10,560
That's awesome.

312
00:25:11,529 --> 00:25:14,464
- Do you know that guy over there?
- Mark.

313
00:25:14,832 --> 00:25:18,427
He's like, "Come to Europe.
You know...

314
00:25:18,703 --> 00:25:21,103
the fashion season's
just starting".

315
00:25:21,306 --> 00:25:25,242
Like, he told me I could be making
a couple grand a day just doing this.

316
00:25:25,543 --> 00:25:28,706
- Is he like for real or what?
- Well, he owns a modeling agency.

317
00:25:28,913 --> 00:25:31,677
- He's for real.
- It was nice for him to say it and all...

318
00:25:31,883 --> 00:25:33,748
but I don't know if he meant it,
you know?

319
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:38,286
Christi Ann. I want you to meet Arthur.
He's an editor from Vogue Magazine.

320
00:25:38,489 --> 00:25:41,822
Love your show, very elegant.

321
00:25:59,944 --> 00:26:01,411
Nikki, you don't care about fashion.

322
00:26:01,613 --> 00:26:02,910
You're just here for the
party afterwards.

323
00:26:03,114 --> 00:26:04,581
How can you blame me?
You always seem to have...

324
00:26:04,782 --> 00:26:06,807
the most entertaining guests.

325
00:26:07,018 --> 00:26:08,417
I'm sure he's already
told you ladies...

326
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:10,918
but Nikki sold his first
screenplay last year.

327
00:26:11,122 --> 00:26:12,885
And now he's in production
on his next film.

328
00:26:13,091 --> 00:26:14,115
Congratulations.

329
00:26:14,325 --> 00:26:15,314
Of course when I sell
one of my scripts...

330
00:26:15,526 --> 00:26:18,859
I'm gonna have to surround myself
with a bevy of beautiful men...

331
00:26:19,063 --> 00:26:22,294
which I'll have to secretly blow
because I have a boyfriend.

332
00:26:22,734 --> 00:26:23,928
You know...

333
00:26:24,135 --> 00:26:27,627
you always have to talk about cock
and fucking and it's really disgusting.

334
00:26:29,307 --> 00:26:31,070
Excuse us.

335
00:26:34,646 --> 00:26:38,446
I am trying to host a party here
so back the fuck off.

336
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:40,413
Okay, can you not
embarrass me, please?

337
00:26:40,618 --> 00:26:41,744
Can not talk like that
in front of me?

338
00:26:41,953 --> 00:26:43,580
Stop smoking that thing in my face.

339
00:26:43,788 --> 00:26:46,518
I smoke wherever I want.
How do you like that?

340
00:26:46,724 --> 00:26:48,954
You're drunk.
You're such an ass.

341
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:07,369
- Stanny, you won't believe this shit.
- I've figured it out. Relationships...

342
00:27:07,578 --> 00:27:10,706
it's all about control. If you're
in control you don't get hurt.

343
00:27:10,915 --> 00:27:11,904
'Cause everyone's afraid
of getting hurt.

344
00:27:12,116 --> 00:27:13,811
I gotta tell you what this guy
was saying to me.

345
00:27:14,018 --> 00:27:15,679
You know what?
These girls, they just own us.

346
00:27:15,887 --> 00:27:17,252
It was never about sex.
It was about...

347
00:27:17,455 --> 00:27:19,889
being able to give us shit
and we couldn't give shit back.

348
00:27:20,091 --> 00:27:22,958
I know Donna can be shitty
at times but Christi Ann...

349
00:27:23,161 --> 00:27:24,287
Yeah, yeah, she's more subtle at it.

350
00:27:24,495 --> 00:27:27,623
You don't even realize you got
a leash around your neck.

351
00:27:30,234 --> 00:27:32,634
You know what?
You ain't always right, Stanny.

352
00:27:33,171 --> 00:27:36,698
You ain't always right about shit
and you're wrong about that girl.

353
00:27:36,908 --> 00:27:39,900
Yeah, right. You're falling all over
these phony who wants to be...

354
00:27:40,111 --> 00:27:43,342
...a high-class designer.
- Why do always do this?

355
00:27:43,548 --> 00:27:45,778
Why is that every time
I like a girl...

356
00:27:45,983 --> 00:27:48,281
you say she's no good
'cause of something?

357
00:27:49,053 --> 00:27:52,420
You say it like she's trying
to split you and me up or something.

358
00:27:52,824 --> 00:27:54,291
You know what?

359
00:27:54,492 --> 00:27:57,188
- I think it's the other way around.
- You really think...

360
00:27:57,495 --> 00:28:00,191
that that girl
considers you her equal?

361
00:28:00,698 --> 00:28:02,723
Brother, that girl considers
herself above you.

362
00:28:06,771 --> 00:28:09,934
I'm just saving you
from a painful fall!

363
00:28:10,408 --> 00:28:14,139
My girlfriend's got me buying
every goddamned thing here.

364
00:28:14,345 --> 00:28:16,040
That's wonderful! Or maybe not.

365
00:28:16,247 --> 00:28:17,839
I wouldn't be here
if it weren't for her.

366
00:28:18,049 --> 00:28:20,210
I'm blowing cash
on that dress, this skirt...

367
00:28:20,418 --> 00:28:21,544
Don't even listen to him.

368
00:28:21,753 --> 00:28:24,085
- He can afford it. He's a lawyer.
- Lawyer my ass.

369
00:28:24,288 --> 00:28:28,315
She's got one hand in my pants,
one hand in my goddamned wallet.

370
00:28:28,526 --> 00:28:31,188
- Your illustrious model.
- He's not really a model.

371
00:28:31,396 --> 00:28:34,422
He's actually my personal cabana boy.

372
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:37,731
Come with me right now.

373
00:28:43,374 --> 00:28:46,810
That's exactly what I'm talking about.
Great. Okay, talk to you later.

374
00:28:47,779 --> 00:28:49,178
Don't be showing up
at my girlfriend's house.

375
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:50,847
You guys are boyfriend
and girlfriend now?

376
00:28:51,048 --> 00:28:52,037
- That's cool.
- Yeah.

377
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:54,878
So maybe you don't need
to be stopping by here anymore.

378
00:28:55,086 --> 00:28:56,713
Christi Ann invited me.

379
00:28:56,921 --> 00:28:59,253
You wanna push it?
We'll settle this old school.

380
00:28:59,457 --> 00:29:01,118
What? We're gonna break dance?

381
00:29:01,793 --> 00:29:04,489
Look, shit. I forgot
to tell you about him.

382
00:29:04,695 --> 00:29:06,458
Tell him about me what?
I'm standing right fucking here.

383
00:29:06,664 --> 00:29:08,188
Don't talk about me like
I'm a piece of friggin' wood.

384
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:09,388
Easy, fella, you don't gotta...

385
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,397
"Easy, fella"? Do I look like a fucking
horse to you?

386
00:29:11,602 --> 00:29:14,002
Do I have fucking hooves?
Don't fucking say "easy fella" to me!

387
00:29:14,205 --> 00:29:15,934
Did you say the word "fuck"
enough in that sentence?

388
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:18,665
No, let me add a few more.
Fuck you. And fuck you too!

389
00:29:18,876 --> 00:29:20,400
Let's just all cool out.

390
00:29:20,845 --> 00:29:22,312
- Stanny!
- Wanna try to grab me again, fucker?

391
00:29:22,513 --> 00:29:24,606
- Easy, fella, just...
- Quit saying "easy fella" to me!

392
00:29:24,816 --> 00:29:26,283
- Just chill the fuck out!
- Stanny!

393
00:29:26,651 --> 00:29:29,677
- Don't you lay a hand on me!
- I'm not gonna lay a hand on you.

394
00:29:29,887 --> 00:29:30,876
Didn't even lay a hand on him.

395
00:29:31,088 --> 00:29:32,146
I knocked him on his ass
with my elbow.

396
00:29:32,356 --> 00:29:35,621
Stanny, get in the goddamned house.
And, Damien, you can go!

397
00:29:37,528 --> 00:29:39,655
- I hope you're proud of yourself.
- I hope you're proud of yourself...

398
00:29:39,864 --> 00:29:42,594
using that stupid fuck
to get a reaction out of me.

399
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:46,031
Yeah, go ahead, keep fooling yourself.
At least you're fooling somebody.

400
00:29:51,909 --> 00:29:57,506
- Joe, I'm gonna cum...
- You motherfuckin' shit!

401
00:30:07,124 --> 00:30:09,251
Thank you, Joe.

402
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:13,328
Was that good?
Was that good, Joe?

403
00:30:15,299 --> 00:30:18,393
Do you want me to get you a towel?

404
00:30:53,237 --> 00:30:56,536
Just fucking listen to me, alright?
You realize what you do to me?

405
00:30:56,741 --> 00:31:01,075
You insist that I throw you down
and treat you like a cheap whore...

406
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:02,337
'cause it's the only way
you can get off.

407
00:31:02,547 --> 00:31:05,277
Then in daily life if I show
any form of aggression...

408
00:31:05,483 --> 00:31:08,919
or jealousy, you freak the fuck out.
Do you know how confusing it is...

409
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,486
...to be in a relationship with you?
- What we do in the bedroom...

410
00:31:11,689 --> 00:31:14,157
and what we do in our relationship
out in the real world...

411
00:31:14,358 --> 00:31:15,882
those are two goddamned
different things, Stanny.

412
00:31:16,093 --> 00:31:19,790
So just as long as we do everything
the way you want on your terms...

413
00:31:19,997 --> 00:31:21,396
then we'll be fine.

414
00:31:21,599 --> 00:31:23,829
Why do you have to be
so combative with me?

415
00:31:24,035 --> 00:31:27,903
I'm not the combative one, okay?
This is what you do. It's not funny.

416
00:31:28,105 --> 00:31:30,630
You pick fights with me and then
you yell at me for fighting!

417
00:31:30,841 --> 00:31:33,537
I'm not the one who's fucking
yelling here, okay, buddy?

418
00:31:33,744 --> 00:31:35,143
You instigate me to do shit.

419
00:31:35,346 --> 00:31:38,042
Then when I do you get to point out
how fucked up I am.

420
00:31:38,249 --> 00:31:41,912
'Cause you're so pathetically afraid
I might realize how fucked up you are.

421
00:31:42,119 --> 00:31:44,781
Oh, I'm the fucked up one?
I'm the fucked up one?

422
00:31:44,989 --> 00:31:48,789
Honey, I gotta fucking hold you down
and call you a whore for you to cum...

423
00:31:48,993 --> 00:31:50,688
and you say I got self-esteem issues?

424
00:31:50,895 --> 00:31:53,022
You know what?
Fuck this and fuck you...

425
00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:56,597
because I am not gonna do this
with you, fucking asshole!

426
00:31:56,801 --> 00:32:00,293
- I am through!
- Be a fucking rich bitch crybaby.

427
00:32:00,504 --> 00:32:04,065
It doesn't affect me anymore 'cause
I'm done back-peddling just so...

428
00:32:04,275 --> 00:32:07,676
I don't notice what a goddamned
psycho you are. You're a head case.

429
00:32:07,878 --> 00:32:10,438
I am not the fucked up one.
I am not the psycho, okay?

430
00:32:10,648 --> 00:32:14,778
I'm not the one that's hit people.
You should be in goddamned therapy!

431
00:32:14,986 --> 00:32:16,977
You're the one who's fucked up,
just like your goddamned parents.

432
00:32:17,188 --> 00:32:19,418
- You're just like them!
- Well, I don't have the luxury...

433
00:32:19,624 --> 00:32:24,527
of your rich parents to pay for
your goddamned therapist, alright?

434
00:32:24,729 --> 00:32:27,391
And you know what? All that
money you waste on that bullshit...

435
00:32:27,598 --> 00:32:31,728
I'll solve your problem right now
in three words: eat less food!

436
00:32:40,845 --> 00:32:45,373
You're a fucking asshole,
you know what?

437
00:32:46,617 --> 00:32:48,847
You're a fucking asshole.

438
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:52,847
And I loved you. I did.
I loved you.

439
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:57,286
I don't know why. I don't know
why I did! I was stupid!

440
00:32:57,495 --> 00:33:02,125
I was really dumb! I'm sorry!
I'm sorry I did this to us!

441
00:33:02,333 --> 00:33:06,133
I did it and I'm sorry!
You gotta go!

442
00:33:35,066 --> 00:33:37,899
- Here we go again.
- No, it's for real this time, bro.

443
00:33:38,903 --> 00:33:42,202
- What happened?
- I stopped thinking with my dick.

444
00:33:42,807 --> 00:33:45,241
No, I take that back.
I stopped thinking with my wallet.

445
00:33:45,443 --> 00:33:47,968
You think if I had a job I'd be putting
up with that bullshit?

446
00:33:48,179 --> 00:33:49,646
I just wanted to sleep late.

447
00:33:49,847 --> 00:33:52,509
I've been working hard my whole life
and I wanted a break.

448
00:33:52,717 --> 00:33:55,982
We got a break.
Now what?

449
00:33:56,320 --> 00:34:00,416
Now what? I'll get myself
a job tending bar at night...

450
00:34:00,725 --> 00:34:02,716
write during the day...

451
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:05,187
I'm gonna be a starving artist.

452
00:34:05,396 --> 00:34:08,297
Look, you don't gotta come
with me, alright? Stay here.

453
00:34:08,499 --> 00:34:10,194
This works for you.
Doesn't work for me.

454
00:34:10,401 --> 00:34:12,096
Stanny, just calm down.

455
00:34:12,303 --> 00:34:15,534
Just sleep over it. Maybe you'll feel
different about it in the morning.

456
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:17,833
I ain't gonna feel any different
about it tomorrow, Joe.

457
00:34:18,042 --> 00:34:20,510
Where the fuck are you
gonna go at three a. m?

458
00:34:32,857 --> 00:34:35,155
Bro, just go back to the party.

459
00:34:35,826 --> 00:34:38,420
Go have fun, alright?

460
00:34:38,629 --> 00:34:41,291
Don't worry about me.

461
00:34:45,402 --> 00:34:48,894
Just try and get
some sleep, alright?

462
00:35:33,984 --> 00:35:35,474
So...

463
00:35:36,086 --> 00:35:39,954
I think I'm gonna take
that guy up on that offer.

464
00:35:40,157 --> 00:35:41,647
What guy?

465
00:35:42,393 --> 00:35:44,293
That agent guy. He...

466
00:35:44,995 --> 00:35:47,190
said he'd get me a plane ticket
and that his...

467
00:35:47,398 --> 00:35:49,423
agency has some sort
of a deal with a...

468
00:35:49,633 --> 00:35:54,229
hotel in... Milan.
It's in Europe.

469
00:35:59,476 --> 00:36:01,569
I leave tomorrow.

470
00:36:03,147 --> 00:36:08,244
- The fashion season starts soon so...
- I know when the season starts.

471
00:36:11,088 --> 00:36:15,024
It's kinda cool though, right?
I mean, never been to Europe.

472
00:36:15,693 --> 00:36:18,423
Shit, I've never been anywhere.

473
00:36:22,466 --> 00:36:25,299
How am I ever gonna
repay you for this?

474
00:36:30,674 --> 00:36:33,700
I think it's a great opportunity.

475
00:36:39,149 --> 00:36:41,174
- Christi Ann.
- Hi!

476
00:36:41,385 --> 00:36:44,047
- Hi. These are my friends. Justin.
- Justin.

477
00:36:44,255 --> 00:36:46,553
- And this is Carlos.
- Hi. How you doing?

478
00:36:46,757 --> 00:36:48,884
- Thanks for the invitation...
- Yeah.

479
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:54,295
...for your party.
- It was fantastic. The show...

480
00:37:37,374 --> 00:37:42,539
- So you'll be back in four months?
- Yeah, when the season ends.

481
00:37:44,081 --> 00:37:46,572
Well, good luck.

482
00:37:48,352 --> 00:37:51,150
You too.

483
00:38:06,937 --> 00:38:10,429
Well, at least your show
was a big hit.

484
00:38:18,816 --> 00:38:20,943
And to think I didn't want to go
to California with you.

485
00:38:21,151 --> 00:38:25,281
- Wherever we go, we go together.
- Yeah.

486
00:38:25,489 --> 00:38:28,549
This is gonna be a tough act
to follow, though.

487
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:32,918
But I bet there's all kinds of
different countries and shit in Europe.

488
00:38:34,832 --> 00:38:37,027
Man, my best friend's gonna be
a friggin' supermodel.

489
00:38:37,234 --> 00:38:39,532
We're gonna be balls deep
in ass over there.

490
00:38:41,905 --> 00:38:43,270
Wow...

491
00:38:43,941 --> 00:38:47,604
...what a summer.
- Tell me about it.

492
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:52,173
Goddamn it, I smoke too much pot.

493
00:38:54,351 --> 00:38:58,481
I'm sorry that it didn't work out
with Stanny.

494
00:38:59,356 --> 00:39:02,348
Yeah. I'm sorry too.

495
00:39:04,528 --> 00:39:07,190
Guess it's just
you and me again, kiddo.

496
00:39:12,302 --> 00:39:14,133
They sure were funny.

497
00:39:17,975 --> 00:39:20,068
Yeah.

498
00:39:20,744 --> 00:39:23,144
You said we'd look back
on this and laugh.

499
00:39:29,053 --> 00:39:30,918
We're crazy, aren't we?

500
00:39:31,822 --> 00:39:36,623
Yeah.
But we're damned great at it.

501
00:39:48,605 --> 00:39:50,596
My God!

502
00:39:56,513 --> 00:40:00,950
- You're gonna miss her, ain't you?
- You're gonna miss Christi Ann?

503
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:04,353
Joe...

504
00:40:05,556 --> 00:40:07,820
look, I'm starting
to like this LA thing...

505
00:40:08,025 --> 00:40:10,493
like writing movies and...

506
00:40:11,962 --> 00:40:14,123
I don't know if I'd like Europe
all that much.

507
00:40:15,365 --> 00:40:20,496
- Bro, you gotta come with me.
- No. This writing thing, I gotta do it.

508
00:40:20,704 --> 00:40:23,036
Well, I don't wanna go
over there all by myself.

509
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:27,237
I don't think you really want
to go there in the first place.

510
00:40:27,611 --> 00:40:30,808
Look, I gotta leave that house,
but you don't.

511
00:40:32,449 --> 00:40:36,943
And what I said about you and
Christi Ann last night, I was wrong.

512
00:40:37,721 --> 00:40:42,715
I mean, thank God girls bitch at us:
make you dress better, motivate you.

513
00:40:44,561 --> 00:40:49,362
I ain't the expert on relationships
obviously, but I know this:

514
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,929
you don't wanna leave your girl.

515
00:40:55,639 --> 00:40:59,871
- Did you love Donna?
- Despite how much I hated her...

516
00:41:00,410 --> 00:41:02,139
I always will.

517
00:41:06,350 --> 00:41:07,977
You think I'm in love?

518
00:41:10,454 --> 00:41:12,922
Do you think you are?

519
00:41:36,914 --> 00:41:40,816
Me and you ain't breaking up.
Go on, get out of here.

520
00:42:26,897 --> 00:42:30,765
You wouldn't kick me out or nothing
if I told you I loved you, would you?

521
00:42:32,002 --> 00:42:33,731
I love you too.

522
00:43:33,597 --> 00:43:37,055
<i>So it's kind of a happy ending,
for Joe and Christi Ann anyways.</i>

523
00:43:37,567 --> 00:43:39,000
<i>Don't worry about me and Donna.</i>

524
00:43:39,202 --> 00:43:41,261
<i>You know real life,
it ain't like the movies.</i>

525
00:43:41,471 --> 00:43:42,870
<i>Life is just a bunch of stories
you go through...</i>

526
00:43:43,073 --> 00:43:44,597
<i>and they all end sooner or later.</i>

527
00:43:45,442 --> 00:43:48,878
<i>But it's okay. I'm gonna go
find my next story.</i>

528
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:51,108
<i>Hope you do the same.</i>

529
00:48:02,599 --> 00:48:05,591
