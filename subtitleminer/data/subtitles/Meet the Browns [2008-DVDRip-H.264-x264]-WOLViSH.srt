# Ain't nobody crying #

# Lying to the races,

# I said it sure
feels good to me... #

21
00:01:54,723 --> 00:01:56,486
Hurry up. Come on.

22
00:01:56,558 --> 00:01:58,355
Mmm.

23
00:01:59,728 --> 00:02:03,129
- Morning, Miss Mildred.
- Girl, you got my money?

24
00:02:03,198 --> 00:02:05,496
I get paid today. I'll have it
for you when I pick her up.

25
00:02:05,567 --> 00:02:07,160
Bye, baby.
Mommy loves you.

26
00:02:07,236 --> 00:02:10,000
- All right.
- Here you go.

27
00:02:10,072 --> 00:02:11,868
Don't you see me
trying to get to work?

28
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,772
Harry, these ain't
nothing but bills.

29
00:02:13,843 --> 00:02:15,777
Just put 'em in the box
next time.

30
00:02:15,845 --> 00:02:18,507
Come on,
come on, come on.

31
00:02:18,581 --> 00:02:20,070
All right.
Have a good one.

32
00:02:20,148 --> 00:02:22,515
- Bye, baby.
- Bye, Mama.

33
00:02:24,653 --> 00:02:27,986
Cheryl, please don't do this to me.
Please don't do this. Please.

34
00:02:28,057 --> 00:02:30,548
Henry, you know we ride
this bus every day.

35
00:02:30,626 --> 00:02:32,092
- She is coming!
- Tell her come on.

36
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,129
Tell her come on.
Tell her come on!

37
00:02:38,299 --> 00:02:39,995
You know what?
I'm moving the bus.

38
00:02:40,069 --> 00:02:43,197
- And I'll sue you and this bus company.
- Calm down.

39
00:02:43,272 --> 00:02:45,399
- You ain't suing nobody.
- You're not going anywhere!

40
00:02:45,474 --> 00:02:47,442
- Your donuts can wait!
- Don't you worry about my donuts.

41
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:49,239
I'ma drive off.
Get out of the door.

42
00:02:49,311 --> 00:02:52,007
- She can't be late for work.
- We all gonna be late for work.

43
00:02:52,081 --> 00:02:53,946
And you shut up!
I don't know you.

44
00:02:54,016 --> 00:02:56,450
Cheryl, will you stop talking
to the patrons like that?

45
00:02:58,454 --> 00:03:01,218
Get out of the door.

46
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:04,316
Don't you be cussing at me.

47
00:03:04,393 --> 00:03:07,362
Tell her to come on.
I'ma lose my job!

48
00:03:13,803 --> 00:03:15,567
- She's coming!
- Tell her come on.

49
00:03:17,873 --> 00:03:22,276
Oh! Thanks, Henry.
You're the best.

50
00:03:22,344 --> 00:03:24,142
You have something to say?

51
00:03:26,182 --> 00:03:28,116
Mm-hmm.
That's what I thought.

52
00:03:28,184 --> 00:03:31,620
Oh. Oh, God.

53
00:03:41,631 --> 00:03:45,589
Sorry. The kids were
running... running late.

54
00:03:45,668 --> 00:03:48,035
I was not gonna
let him leave without you.

55
00:03:48,104 --> 00:03:52,632
Good looking out. You know
I can't afford to get docked.

56
00:03:52,709 --> 00:03:55,177
- What's all that?
- Bills.

57
00:03:55,245 --> 00:03:58,737
Brenda, has Michael given you
any money for your son?

58
00:03:58,815 --> 00:04:02,546
Don't ask. Oh, speaking of...
can you loan me $100?

59
00:04:02,619 --> 00:04:04,917
I've got to give
Miss Mildred something.

60
00:04:04,988 --> 00:04:06,888
She won't keep Lena
for me next week.

61
00:04:06,957 --> 00:04:08,288
Come on. I know.

62
00:04:08,358 --> 00:04:12,556
Okay, let me look at my bills
and I'll let you know.

63
00:04:12,629 --> 00:04:16,360
- Thank you.
- I may be able to give you a joint loan.

64
00:04:16,433 --> 00:04:20,233
- What is a joint loan?
- A loan from my joint money.

65
00:04:20,303 --> 00:04:23,398
Girl. You know what?
You insane.

66
00:04:23,474 --> 00:04:26,033
You know you ain't supposed
to be smoking that stuff

67
00:04:26,109 --> 00:04:28,475
- with your condition.
- Whatever.

68
00:04:29,647 --> 00:04:33,138
- What's that?
- It says my daddy died.

69
00:04:33,216 --> 00:04:37,448
No. Your daddy died?

70
00:04:38,756 --> 00:04:40,690
It says the funeral
is on Saturday.

71
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:43,790
Ay, Brenda, I'm sorry.

72
00:04:43,861 --> 00:04:45,828
- I never met the man.
- Ah.

73
00:04:45,896 --> 00:04:48,228
And what is this here?

74
00:04:48,298 --> 00:04:51,199
Three bus tickets to Georgia.

75
00:04:51,268 --> 00:04:55,035
- Are you going?
- I don't know these people.

76
00:04:55,106 --> 00:04:58,234
They know you. How else would they
know where to send the tickets?

77
00:04:58,309 --> 00:05:00,709
Yeah, but there's four of us, huh?

78
00:05:00,778 --> 00:05:02,677
But that's a good question.

79
00:05:03,848 --> 00:05:05,975
And read this...

80
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:08,280
there is a will.

81
00:05:08,351 --> 00:05:11,048
Oh my God, what if
he was superrich

82
00:05:11,122 --> 00:05:13,886
and left you millions
and millions of dollars?

83
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:17,792
Right. I doubt that.
We never talked about him.

84
00:05:17,862 --> 00:05:20,353
You know, since she used
to do anything for money,

85
00:05:20,431 --> 00:05:23,798
if he was, believe me,
she'd have still been with him.

86
00:05:23,868 --> 00:05:27,065
I think you should go.
You never know, mami.

87
00:05:27,138 --> 00:05:29,436
- You never know.
- Girl.

88
00:05:29,507 --> 00:05:31,738
I ain't going to no Georgia.

89
00:05:34,513 --> 00:05:36,139
What the hell?

90
00:05:37,349 --> 00:05:39,043
What's going on?

91
00:05:41,118 --> 00:05:42,848
Excuse us.
Excuse us.

92
00:05:42,921 --> 00:05:45,354
- Coming through.
- Excuse me.

93
00:05:45,423 --> 00:05:47,823
Excuse me, ma'am.
What's going on, girl?

94
00:05:47,892 --> 00:05:49,224
- Look.
- What happened?

95
00:05:49,294 --> 00:05:51,022
They shut the place down, Cheryl.

96
00:05:51,095 --> 00:05:52,654
They said they moved
the plant to Mexico.

97
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:54,790
- Hurry!
- And they didn't tell us!

98
00:05:54,866 --> 00:05:56,958
- Move move!
- Go go! Come on!

99
00:05:57,035 --> 00:05:59,970
Wait! We were supposed
to get paid today!

100
00:06:02,206 --> 00:06:05,198
- I've got to pay my light bill today.
- Who has a match?!

101
00:06:05,276 --> 00:06:09,111
I'm going to burn this place down!
Who has a match?!

102
00:06:09,181 --> 00:06:11,376
Don't give this fool
no match. She bipolar.

103
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:14,283
No, seriously. She gotta take
medication just to stay right.

104
00:06:14,353 --> 00:06:17,413
I know one of you have a match!
You smoke, Georgia!

105
00:06:17,489 --> 00:06:19,456
Give me a match.
Give it to me.

106
00:06:26,865 --> 00:06:29,095
Cheryl, put that out.

107
00:06:30,635 --> 00:06:32,535
Come on, I'm trying
to chill out.

108
00:06:32,604 --> 00:06:34,697
You know with your
chemical imbalance

109
00:06:34,773 --> 00:06:36,468
you're not supposed
to do drugs.

110
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:38,805
- Did you take your medicine?
- I was trying to,

111
00:06:38,877 --> 00:06:41,175
but then you started talking
about "put that out."

112
00:06:41,246 --> 00:06:44,147
All right. I'm just
looking out for you.

113
00:06:44,216 --> 00:06:48,118
I'm fine. I just can't believe they
would do something like that.

114
00:06:48,187 --> 00:06:51,782
- Hello, ladies.
- Oh, hi, Miss Mildred.

115
00:06:51,857 --> 00:06:54,849
- How you doing?
- Hi, Mildred.

116
00:06:54,926 --> 00:06:58,293
Miss Mildred to you.

117
00:06:58,363 --> 00:07:02,926
- Girl, you got my money?
- We lost our job today, Miss Mildred.

118
00:07:03,002 --> 00:07:05,094
Now I'm running a daycare,
not a welfare.

119
00:07:05,171 --> 00:07:08,231
You're running an illegal daycare,
so relax.

120
00:07:08,307 --> 00:07:11,299
Little girl, you don't know nothing
about my business.

121
00:07:14,547 --> 00:07:15,945
This is the last day.

122
00:07:16,014 --> 00:07:19,006
I'm not keeping your daughter
another minute.

123
00:07:19,084 --> 00:07:21,609
I'll come get her.

124
00:07:21,686 --> 00:07:23,678
She's taking a nap now.

125
00:07:23,756 --> 00:07:26,657
That's the trouble
with you young mothers...

126
00:07:26,726 --> 00:07:28,489
only think about yourselves.

127
00:07:28,561 --> 00:07:30,551
You just said
come get her.

128
00:07:30,629 --> 00:07:34,396
And I meant it...
after she wakes up and eats.

129
00:07:36,234 --> 00:07:38,726
- Okay.
- The child is sleeping.

130
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,164
Thank you,
Miss Mildred!

131
00:07:42,241 --> 00:07:45,335
- She's crazy.
- Naw, she's all right.

132
00:07:45,411 --> 00:07:48,539
Shoot. I don't know what
I'm gonna do now though.

133
00:07:48,614 --> 00:07:51,447
- She don't play with her money.
- Yeah, me neither.

134
00:07:51,517 --> 00:07:53,985
If I had known they were going
to close down the plant,

135
00:07:54,053 --> 00:07:57,489
I would have beat
my supervisors up yesterday.

136
00:07:59,693 --> 00:08:01,284
Well, what you gonna do?

137
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,022
Shoot, I'm barely
getting by as it was.

138
00:08:04,097 --> 00:08:06,292
What you have to do is

139
00:08:06,365 --> 00:08:08,732
go and file child support
on that Michael.

140
00:08:08,801 --> 00:08:11,430
- Hm-mmm.
- You know that Jenny got

141
00:08:11,505 --> 00:08:13,666
$8,000 in back child support.

142
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:16,402
They'll get it for you
and they'll kick his ass.

143
00:08:16,477 --> 00:08:20,140
8,000? Shoot.

144
00:08:20,214 --> 00:08:22,876
No, he'd kill me.

145
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:26,408
Mamacita,
you go talk to him.

146
00:08:26,487 --> 00:08:30,217
Let me know if you need me
and my nine to pay him a little visit.

147
00:08:32,226 --> 00:08:33,625
All right.

148
00:08:33,827 --> 00:08:38,264
# Troubled little angel #

149
00:08:38,331 --> 00:08:43,065
# Inconsistent, flying blind
most of the time #

150
00:08:43,137 --> 00:08:47,767
# Drama queen... #

151
00:08:49,843 --> 00:08:53,870
# Preening and untangling #

152
00:08:53,947 --> 00:08:55,882
# Feathers in her wings #

153
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:58,474
# Captured by her dreams... #

154
00:08:58,552 --> 00:09:01,852
- Good morning, Mama.
- Hey, sweetheart.

155
00:09:05,425 --> 00:09:07,893
# Needy little baby... #

156
00:09:09,963 --> 00:09:12,158
# Open up your heart... #

157
00:09:13,501 --> 00:09:15,229
Are you crying, Mama?

158
00:09:15,302 --> 00:09:17,930
No no, I'm fine.

159
00:09:18,005 --> 00:09:19,870
We're gonna be
all right, Ma.

160
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:23,205
We've been here before,
and don't we always make it?

161
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:26,507
- Yeah, we do.
- Yeah.

162
00:09:28,082 --> 00:09:30,050
Let me cook this for you.

163
00:09:31,085 --> 00:09:32,711
Relax.

164
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:42,426
Uh-oh.
Here you go, Mama.

165
00:09:42,497 --> 00:09:45,557
It's one of them
old songs. Come on.

166
00:09:45,633 --> 00:09:47,396
- Dance with me.
- Michael. Michael.

167
00:09:47,468 --> 00:09:49,458
- No, baby.
- It's your song. You'll feel better.

168
00:09:49,536 --> 00:09:51,835
- Come on, dance with me.
- Michael.

169
00:09:51,906 --> 00:09:53,874
Come on.

170
00:09:55,443 --> 00:09:57,707
Do I have to listen to this?

171
00:09:57,779 --> 00:09:59,679
Yes, and you're
gonna like it.

172
00:10:02,517 --> 00:10:04,485
# You make me happy... #

173
00:10:04,552 --> 00:10:06,543
All we got to eat
is oatmeal?

174
00:10:06,621 --> 00:10:09,454
Yes, and you're gonna
like that too.

175
00:10:09,524 --> 00:10:11,958
Baby, this is for you.
You eat that, all right?

176
00:10:12,026 --> 00:10:13,960
Mama, huh-uh.

177
00:10:14,028 --> 00:10:16,394
I got honeys at school
that'll give me breakfast.

178
00:10:16,464 --> 00:10:18,763
Michael, I want you to eat this.

179
00:10:18,834 --> 00:10:22,963
Come on now. What would
I do without you, hmm?

180
00:10:43,558 --> 00:10:45,049
Hey hey, man, come on.

181
00:10:45,127 --> 00:10:46,754
- Please, don't do that.
- I'm sorry.

182
00:10:46,829 --> 00:10:48,762
Come on, have a heart...
for my baby.

183
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:51,129
- Lady, I'm doing what they tell me.
- I called!

184
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,828
- I told them I needed a couple days!
- I'm sorry.

185
00:10:54,902 --> 00:10:56,871
Come on, man.

186
00:11:06,782 --> 00:11:08,409
Come on.

187
00:11:12,821 --> 00:11:14,983
Go up, go up!

188
00:11:20,029 --> 00:11:22,293
- Yes!
- There you go!

189
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:30,670
- Defense! Defense!
- Right here!

190
00:11:30,739 --> 00:11:34,368
Defense! Defense!

191
00:11:40,717 --> 00:11:42,650
Time out! Time out!

192
00:11:42,718 --> 00:11:44,277
Time out.

193
00:11:47,524 --> 00:11:49,355
Come on!

194
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:02,633
Go go go!

195
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,872
You the man!

196
00:12:11,948 --> 00:12:14,041
Get up!

197
00:12:15,352 --> 00:12:16,819
Whoo!

198
00:12:21,224 --> 00:12:23,385
That's what
I'm talking about.

199
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:24,859
What'd I say?
What'd I say?

200
00:12:28,365 --> 00:12:30,697
Good job, my Mikey.

201
00:12:30,767 --> 00:12:34,568
- Goodbye, everybody. See you tomorrow.
- Bye.

202
00:12:35,772 --> 00:12:38,935
Ma, you see me score?

203
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:40,908
Whoo! I saw ya!

204
00:12:40,977 --> 00:12:43,810
Saw those shoes too.

205
00:12:45,315 --> 00:12:47,545
Now don't worry
about that, Ma.

206
00:12:47,617 --> 00:12:51,053
I told the guys on the team
that they're my lucky shoes.

207
00:12:51,121 --> 00:12:54,580
I didn't know you
were coming.

208
00:12:54,658 --> 00:12:57,183
- Thought you had to work.
- Yeah, I did too.

209
00:12:57,261 --> 00:12:59,228
- I lost my job.
- What?

210
00:12:59,295 --> 00:13:01,695
- Oh my gosh!
- We're gonna be all right.

211
00:13:01,765 --> 00:13:05,725
- Don't worry.
- My teacher can help me get a job.

212
00:13:05,803 --> 00:13:09,170
- No. Hm-mmm.
- But, Mama, you've gotta let me help.

213
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,800
No, you're staying
in school, all right?

214
00:13:11,876 --> 00:13:13,570
But I can work
and go to school, Ma.

215
00:13:13,643 --> 00:13:16,476
Listen, baby, I thought
the same thing. Huh?

216
00:13:16,546 --> 00:13:18,071
I end up having
to drop out of school,

217
00:13:18,149 --> 00:13:20,242
working a bunch of dead-end jobs
just to make ends meet.

218
00:13:20,317 --> 00:13:22,250
I don't want you working.

219
00:13:22,318 --> 00:13:25,755
Now you just... you just
concentrate on them books

220
00:13:25,823 --> 00:13:27,552
and... and playing ball.

221
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:29,286
I'm gonna make it work.

222
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,294
Are you sure?

223
00:13:31,362 --> 00:13:32,659
Hey.

224
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:34,630
One thing a black woman
know how to do...

225
00:13:34,698 --> 00:13:37,098
that's make it. Hmm?

226
00:13:42,507 --> 00:13:45,408
- Yo, what's up, Mike?
- Hey, what's up, Cal?

227
00:13:45,477 --> 00:13:46,841
Chilling.
Good game tonight though.

228
00:13:46,911 --> 00:13:48,812
Thanks. Nice whip, man.

229
00:13:48,879 --> 00:13:50,870
I appreciate it, man.
I just bought this.

230
00:13:50,948 --> 00:13:53,610
It's my baby.
How you doing, Miss Brown?

231
00:13:53,684 --> 00:13:56,882
- Hey.
- Hey, we're going to kick it tonight,

232
00:13:56,955 --> 00:13:59,388
celebrate a little bit.
You want to roll with us?

233
00:14:01,225 --> 00:14:03,887
No, man. I've gotta walk
my mom and my sisters home.

234
00:14:05,297 --> 00:14:07,093
I can give y'all a ride.
You want a ride?

235
00:14:07,164 --> 00:14:09,632
- No.
- Okay.

236
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,896
- Hey, Cal.
- Yes, ma'am?

237
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:15,700
- Who's car is that?
- It's mine. I just bought this.

238
00:14:15,773 --> 00:14:17,969
Calvin, where you working?

239
00:14:18,043 --> 00:14:20,511
Hmm? Huh?

240
00:14:20,579 --> 00:14:23,810
You know your mama'd turn over
in her grave if she knew, don't you?

241
00:14:23,882 --> 00:14:26,077
All right all right,
I'll holler, man.

242
00:14:26,151 --> 00:14:28,676
- All right, man. You be easy.
- Come on, Ma.

243
00:14:28,753 --> 00:14:30,744
Bye, Miss Brown.

244
00:14:30,822 --> 00:14:34,258
I don't want you hanging with them boys.
I don't even want you talking to 'em.

245
00:14:34,326 --> 00:14:37,818
But, Ma, you know me and Calvin
been hanging since the third grade.

246
00:14:37,896 --> 00:14:39,295
Yeah, well, he done changed.

247
00:14:39,364 --> 00:14:41,264
and I don't want you
with him, all right?

248
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:43,801
- But, Ma, Calvin's cool.
- Look, do you think I'm crazy?

249
00:14:43,869 --> 00:14:46,963
- Huh? Do you?
- No.

250
00:14:47,038 --> 00:14:48,869
Now I know them boys
is in the dope game.

251
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:51,534
I don't want you with them.
Do you hear me?

252
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:54,135
- Do you?
- Yes, ma'am.

253
00:14:54,212 --> 00:14:56,408
All right.

254
00:14:57,449 --> 00:15:00,316
Come on, y'all.
Come on.

255
00:15:13,933 --> 00:15:16,993
- Hey. Mike?
- Yeah.

256
00:15:17,069 --> 00:15:21,027
I'm Harry Belton. Your coach wanted me
to fly up here and see you play.

257
00:15:21,106 --> 00:15:24,564
You're pretty good.
You've got a lot of potential.

258
00:15:24,643 --> 00:15:27,237
Potential?
That's what you call it?

259
00:15:27,312 --> 00:15:29,405
Who is this?
Who are you?

260
00:15:29,481 --> 00:15:32,382
I'm Harry. Mike's coach wanted me
to see your brother play.

261
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:35,147
We run a camp in the summer
for high-school players.

262
00:15:35,221 --> 00:15:38,088
Are your parents around? I'd like
to talk to them about Mike attending.

263
00:15:38,157 --> 00:15:40,887
- I'm his mama.
- Nice try though.

264
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:43,724
Oh. Uh, Mrs. Brown...

265
00:15:43,796 --> 00:15:46,094
- Miss.
- Miss Brown,

266
00:15:46,165 --> 00:15:48,998
can I take you to lunch

267
00:15:49,068 --> 00:15:51,059
so we can talk about Mike?

268
00:15:51,137 --> 00:15:54,038
What? No. Look, mister,
I don't know where you're from,

269
00:15:54,106 --> 00:15:56,007
but what his coach
should've told you

270
00:15:56,075 --> 00:15:59,044
is that I don't want Mike to even
think about basketball until after

271
00:15:59,111 --> 00:16:02,274
he gets into college, which, judging by
his grades, might not even happen.

272
00:16:02,348 --> 00:16:05,511
I agree. Grades are important,
especially the way Mike plays.

273
00:16:05,585 --> 00:16:07,883
Whoa whoa, what's that
supposed to mean?

274
00:16:07,954 --> 00:16:10,013
It means you're talented,
but talent's not enough.

275
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:11,920
You need the right attitude
plus skill.

276
00:16:11,991 --> 00:16:13,754
Look, man.
Hold on, I got skills.

277
00:16:13,826 --> 00:16:16,455
Watch your mouth.
You know what?

278
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:18,394
The reason that coach sent
you over here by yourself

279
00:16:18,464 --> 00:16:20,159
is 'cause he knows
he don't do nothing

280
00:16:20,232 --> 00:16:23,099
but tell these boys in this neighborhood
that they can make it to the pros.

281
00:16:23,169 --> 00:16:24,933
And when they end up
with their hearts broken

282
00:16:25,005 --> 00:16:26,494
they walk around here
mad at the world.

283
00:16:26,572 --> 00:16:28,767
That ain't happening
to my son, okay?

284
00:16:28,841 --> 00:16:30,104
So you're gonna
have to excuse me.

285
00:16:30,177 --> 00:16:32,144
I've got too much on my mind
to deal with this.

286
00:16:32,211 --> 00:16:34,475
Come on, Michael.
Come on.

287
00:16:36,316 --> 00:16:38,944
Potential? Huh.

288
00:16:50,063 --> 00:16:51,928
Girl, you got my money?

289
00:16:51,999 --> 00:16:55,297
No, but I was just wondering
if you could keep her

290
00:16:55,368 --> 00:16:57,633
for just a few hours
while I try and go get it?

291
00:16:57,704 --> 00:16:59,467
Girl, do you think
I'm crazy?

292
00:16:59,539 --> 00:17:02,508
Now you got to pay your money
like all the other mothers in here.

293
00:17:03,543 --> 00:17:06,239
Okay. Thank you.

294
00:17:06,313 --> 00:17:09,282
- Come on.
- Come on in here.

295
00:17:13,754 --> 00:17:16,587
- You hungry?
- No, ma'am.

296
00:17:16,657 --> 00:17:19,217
Yes, you are. Quit lying.

297
00:17:19,292 --> 00:17:21,056
When you bring that baby,

298
00:17:21,129 --> 00:17:23,893
oh, she be starving,
so I know you must be too.

299
00:17:23,965 --> 00:17:26,023
Here, eat that.

300
00:17:31,238 --> 00:17:34,139
I don't know what's the matter
with you young girls

301
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:36,767
having all these babies
you know you can't take care of.

302
00:17:36,843 --> 00:17:40,279
Look, I don't need no lecture from you.
I know what I've done.

303
00:17:40,347 --> 00:17:42,713
They're here now,
they're my responsibility.

304
00:17:42,783 --> 00:17:45,843
You know what?
Lena, come on. Let's go.

305
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:48,013
Oh, sit down, girly.
I'm just talking to you.

306
00:17:55,963 --> 00:17:57,827
Eat and settle down.

307
00:17:57,898 --> 00:17:59,696
Eat.

308
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:04,061
- You're a good mother.
- Huh!

309
00:18:04,138 --> 00:18:07,733
I've got enough bad ones running
through here to know that.

310
00:18:07,809 --> 00:18:10,835
Now what is
going on with you?

311
00:18:14,549 --> 00:18:17,450
I don't know.

312
00:18:20,823 --> 00:18:24,952
Somehow I always managed
to make it through,

313
00:18:25,026 --> 00:18:28,359
but now it's just
getting harder and harder.

314
00:18:28,429 --> 00:18:31,728
It ain't somehow,
it's the Lord.

315
00:18:31,799 --> 00:18:34,597
And all that means is you're getting
close to a breakthrough.

316
00:18:34,669 --> 00:18:37,229
Till then you just keep praying.

317
00:18:37,305 --> 00:18:39,500
I pray.

318
00:18:39,574 --> 00:18:41,940
I try to pray

319
00:18:42,009 --> 00:18:43,602
and I try to live right,

320
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:46,443
but where's it getting me?
Look at me.

321
00:18:46,515 --> 00:18:49,678
If you had seen the look
on my babies' faces

322
00:18:49,752 --> 00:18:51,845
when that man turned
my lights off...

323
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,682
Now you listen to me.

324
00:18:53,755 --> 00:18:56,883
Don't you ever get tired
of doing the right thing,

325
00:18:56,958 --> 00:19:00,155
'cause in the end,
that's what pays off.

326
00:19:00,228 --> 00:19:02,924
You're the best mother
I have seen,

327
00:19:02,997 --> 00:19:05,363
that's why I'm gonna
keep that baby.

328
00:19:06,401 --> 00:19:08,459
Oh.

329
00:19:08,536 --> 00:19:10,903
I wouldn't do that
for these other ones here.

330
00:19:10,973 --> 00:19:13,134
At least they can afford
to pay you, Miss Mildred.

331
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:15,574
Huh! Honey, I don't
want to know half

332
00:19:15,644 --> 00:19:18,442
of what they're doing
to get that money.

333
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:25,079
Go on now.
Take that with you.

334
00:19:29,024 --> 00:19:31,721
Thank you,
just a couple of hours.

335
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:33,591
I swear.
Thank you, Miss Mildred.

336
00:19:47,009 --> 00:19:48,374
All right.

337
00:19:49,479 --> 00:19:51,538
Hold it. Ladies, ladies,

338
00:19:51,614 --> 00:19:54,275
you can't be here.
This is a hard-hat area.

339
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:58,615
Oh. Hi, I'm looking
for Michael Rose.

340
00:19:58,687 --> 00:20:01,122
- Is he here?
- Who's asking?

341
00:20:01,191 --> 00:20:04,648
- Brenda.
- Well, he's busy.

342
00:20:04,726 --> 00:20:07,889
Man, look here.
You'd better go find him.

343
00:20:07,963 --> 00:20:10,898
I'm his baby mama,
and if I don't find him,

344
00:20:10,966 --> 00:20:13,491
you are going to regret it.

345
00:20:23,246 --> 00:20:26,613
- I don't see him, anyway.
- Go take care of this, all right?

346
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:28,115
Wait wait wait wait wait.

347
00:20:28,183 --> 00:20:30,414
All right, all right.
I'm sorry, man.

348
00:20:36,092 --> 00:20:37,821
Brenda, what are
you doing here?

349
00:20:37,894 --> 00:20:41,193
I've been calling you.
You haven't returned my calls.

350
00:20:41,264 --> 00:20:43,232
You know, this job
pays me $25 an hour.

351
00:20:43,299 --> 00:20:44,732
I'm busy.
What do you want?

352
00:20:45,769 --> 00:20:47,827
I lost my job, Michael.

353
00:20:47,904 --> 00:20:49,997
- I ain't got no money.
- Michael...

354
00:20:50,073 --> 00:20:52,439
I've been raising
your son by myself

355
00:20:52,508 --> 00:20:54,636
and in 17 years I ain't never
asked you for nothing.

356
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:58,044
You know, now I just need
a little help.

357
00:20:58,114 --> 00:21:00,810
- I ain't got no money.
- Well, you'd better go find some,

358
00:21:00,884 --> 00:21:03,217
'cause your kids
are hungry, you fool.

359
00:21:03,287 --> 00:21:05,619
- Who the hell is she?
- My name is Child Welfare,

360
00:21:05,689 --> 00:21:07,679
and I'm gonna lock you up.

361
00:21:07,757 --> 00:21:10,487
- Are you threatening me?
- Oh, yeah. What, you don't know

362
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,188
when someone is
threatening you, huh?

363
00:21:12,263 --> 00:21:14,857
Mike... Michael, look.

364
00:21:14,932 --> 00:21:17,127
They turned my lights off,
all right?

365
00:21:17,201 --> 00:21:20,398
Your son, he needs some...
some clothes.

366
00:21:20,471 --> 00:21:22,268
- I told you.
- Could you...

367
00:21:22,339 --> 00:21:25,706
could you just give me
some money for food?

368
00:21:25,776 --> 00:21:27,868
I'll tell you what... y'all need
to take your asses on

369
00:21:27,945 --> 00:21:30,778
and don't you come
to my job no more.

370
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:35,381
Huh! Heh.

371
00:21:35,452 --> 00:21:37,215
Come on.

372
00:21:37,288 --> 00:21:39,654
- Let's go.
- Okay.

373
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:43,226
I'll be right there.

374
00:21:44,962 --> 00:21:46,554
- Cheryl.
- You all right?

375
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:49,463
- Run. Run!
- Oh my God!

376
00:21:54,972 --> 00:21:57,532
I can't go anywhere
with you, Cheryl!

377
00:21:57,608 --> 00:22:00,304
- You could've hit him in the head.
- So? He deserved it!

378
00:22:00,377 --> 00:22:02,902
- You're going to jail.
- Ay, I don't care.

379
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:05,176
I've been there, mamacita.

380
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:07,342
Ai, we need money.

381
00:22:07,418 --> 00:22:09,249
You need money.
I'm gonna rob a bank.

382
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,913
Come on, be serious.

383
00:22:12,556 --> 00:22:15,047
Cheryl, why are
you so crazy?

384
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:17,787
Because it's fun,
because I like it.

385
00:22:17,861 --> 00:22:21,297
You know what? I've been thinking
a lot about your father.

386
00:22:21,365 --> 00:22:23,890
I think you really should
go down there to Georgia.

387
00:22:23,968 --> 00:22:25,869
- What if he left you something?
- No, Cheryl.

388
00:22:25,937 --> 00:22:28,030
Come on. Why not?

389
00:22:29,773 --> 00:22:32,708
Because I'm tired of getting my hopes up
for things that don't happen.

390
00:22:32,776 --> 00:22:35,404
So what? You have nothing
to lose right now.

391
00:22:37,449 --> 00:22:38,779
Come on, there's the bus.

392
00:22:59,671 --> 00:23:01,195
Watch your step.

393
00:23:01,272 --> 00:23:03,934
Watch your step there.

394
00:23:04,009 --> 00:23:05,772
All right,
have a good day now.

395
00:23:18,691 --> 00:23:20,555
This is country.

396
00:23:20,625 --> 00:23:21,957
You can say that again.

397
00:23:22,028 --> 00:23:24,792
Looks like we gonna
see slaves at any minute.

398
00:23:24,864 --> 00:23:26,956
She look like she about
to fight somebody.

399
00:23:27,032 --> 00:23:29,398
Uh, excuse me,
you must be Brenda.

400
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:34,732
I told you.
It's Chicken George.

401
00:23:34,806 --> 00:23:36,900
- Yeah.
- I knowed it! I knowed...

402
00:23:36,976 --> 00:23:38,534
I said to myself...
I said, "Self."

403
00:23:38,611 --> 00:23:40,840
Myself said, "Hmm?"
I said, "That's Brenda.

404
00:23:40,912 --> 00:23:43,506
That's got to be her." All these peoples,
I picked you out...

405
00:23:43,581 --> 00:23:47,143
looked you in the face.
Girl, I'm Leroy Brown.

406
00:23:47,219 --> 00:23:49,550
- Hi.
- My friends call me Leroy Brown.

407
00:23:49,621 --> 00:23:51,453
- You can just call me...
- Leroy Brown?

408
00:23:51,524 --> 00:23:52,923
Yeah yeah,
how'd you know?

409
00:23:52,992 --> 00:23:56,519
- This is my daughter Cora.
- Hello, nice to meet you.

410
00:23:56,595 --> 00:23:58,392
- This is my baby.
- Nice to meet you too.

411
00:23:58,464 --> 00:24:01,228
Oh, look at you!
Hey, who are you?

412
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:03,325
Mommy, I like the clown.

413
00:24:03,402 --> 00:24:05,370
He looks like a flag.

414
00:24:05,438 --> 00:24:08,339
- Yeah.
- Leroy Brown?

415
00:24:08,407 --> 00:24:10,500
You, um... you must be L.B.

416
00:24:10,576 --> 00:24:12,510
Oh no, that's my brother
Larry Brown.

417
00:24:12,579 --> 00:24:14,341
They just call him...
they call him L.B.

418
00:24:14,413 --> 00:24:17,382
Mm-hmm. That's my oldest brother
on my daddy's side.

419
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:19,475
He told me to come
by here and get y'all.

420
00:24:19,552 --> 00:24:21,487
Yeah. Y'all ready to go?

421
00:24:21,555 --> 00:24:23,955
- Yeah, we're ready.
- Grab your stuff. Let's go.

422
00:24:24,024 --> 00:24:26,014
Oh, I'm glad
y'all made it safely.

423
00:24:26,092 --> 00:24:28,424
Come on. You need
some help with that?

424
00:24:28,494 --> 00:24:30,588
I'll get it. I'll get it.
Here, Cora, hold that.

425
00:24:30,663 --> 00:24:33,224
My back is messed up.
Y'all be careful now.

426
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:36,700
L.B., he was gonna come to get y'all,
but he had to go somewhere.

427
00:24:36,769 --> 00:24:38,533
He had to go to Bingo,
I think. You see...

428
00:24:38,605 --> 00:24:40,094
Ooh, Lord.

429
00:24:40,172 --> 00:24:42,334
If y'all feel some jerking,
that's my transmission.

430
00:24:42,409 --> 00:24:43,899
It just "snips" sometimes.

431
00:24:43,977 --> 00:24:47,003
I got it fixed at church
the other day. Yeah.

432
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:49,605
- So how was your ride?
- Oh, it was fine.

433
00:24:49,683 --> 00:24:51,809
- Yes, thank you.
- When my... L.B. told me

434
00:24:51,884 --> 00:24:54,478
I needed to come get you,
he said you's a friend of the family.

435
00:24:54,553 --> 00:24:56,317
I said I'm gonna go get her,

436
00:24:56,389 --> 00:24:58,550
'cause she's a friend of him,
he's a friend of mine.

437
00:24:58,625 --> 00:25:00,751
That's all right.
So where you from?

438
00:25:00,827 --> 00:25:02,886
- Um, Chicago.
- Chicago.

439
00:25:02,963 --> 00:25:05,898
Chicago! That's where them big
buildings is, ain't it?

440
00:25:05,966 --> 00:25:07,661
Yeah, they got
a lot of big buildings.

441
00:25:07,734 --> 00:25:10,726
- Ain't that where that S... Serus Tower?
- The Sears Tower.

442
00:25:10,804 --> 00:25:13,568
Yeah, my daddy...
my daddy just loved it there.

443
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:17,201
He had a... he was there
and everything. I miss my daddy.

444
00:25:17,277 --> 00:25:18,801
It's going to be
all right, Mr. Brown.

445
00:25:18,879 --> 00:25:20,574
I just can't take it.
Lord, take the wheel.

446
00:25:20,647 --> 00:25:22,239
I want you to look
at the road, Mr. Brown!

447
00:25:22,315 --> 00:25:24,146
Get the wheel!

448
00:25:24,217 --> 00:25:27,414
- Chicago's a nice town.
- Yeah, I like it.

449
00:25:27,487 --> 00:25:29,751
- Mm-hmm.
- See, she likes it.

450
00:25:29,823 --> 00:25:32,315
- I couldn't live there.
- Would you look at the road?

451
00:25:32,393 --> 00:25:35,385
Huh-uh, gimme the South.
Yes, I like the trees of the South.

452
00:25:35,463 --> 00:25:38,829
I don't like it. There's too much
smog and stuff there.

453
00:25:38,899 --> 00:25:40,663
- Yeah?
- My daddy liked it though.

454
00:25:40,735 --> 00:25:43,499
- It's okay, Mr. Brown.
- He was always in Chicago.

455
00:25:43,571 --> 00:25:45,800
It's all right. I want you
to watch the road.

456
00:25:45,872 --> 00:25:47,806
Oh wait, now watch the road!

457
00:25:47,874 --> 00:25:50,343
He just taught me so much.

458
00:25:50,411 --> 00:25:52,174
He taught me how
to dance and swim.

459
00:25:52,246 --> 00:25:53,678
I miss him.

460
00:26:00,086 --> 00:26:03,180
- Now this is when he was a young boy.
- Mm-hmm.

461
00:26:03,257 --> 00:26:05,850
Oh, he was so handsome.

462
00:26:05,926 --> 00:26:08,258
Now over here...

463
00:26:08,328 --> 00:26:10,524
- this is when he married.
- That's my mama.

464
00:26:10,598 --> 00:26:11,929
Oh, wow.

465
00:26:11,999 --> 00:26:14,024
So how you know our daddy?

466
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:17,867
- Well, my mama...
- Where is everybody? Oh!

467
00:26:17,939 --> 00:26:19,964
- Here we go.
- Y'all Daddy go.

468
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:22,134
Oh, Lord, help me.
Help me.

469
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:25,373
Vera, will you get somewhere
and sit down without all that drama?

470
00:26:25,446 --> 00:26:27,539
Go on, y'all, daddy dead!

471
00:26:27,615 --> 00:26:29,606
Vera, get ahold
of yourself now.

472
00:26:29,684 --> 00:26:32,744
Oh, Lord, oh, Lord, I just don't know
what I'm gonna do, y'all.

473
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:34,811
I can't sleep.
I can't eat.

474
00:26:34,889 --> 00:26:37,187
- You want some cake?
- Oh, yes, cake would help.

475
00:26:37,258 --> 00:26:40,056
That would definitely help me.
Got any rum in that?

476
00:26:40,127 --> 00:26:41,526
I don't know. Here you go.

477
00:26:41,596 --> 00:26:44,895
Oh Lord, who's this big
yellow woman blinding me?

478
00:26:44,966 --> 00:26:48,231
Good Lord, eclipse.
Eclipse!

479
00:26:48,302 --> 00:26:51,135
- This is my daughter Cora.
- Your daughter?!

480
00:26:51,205 --> 00:26:55,267
Brown, I didn't know
your soldiers marched.

481
00:26:55,344 --> 00:26:57,437
Yeah, you remember in school

482
00:26:57,512 --> 00:27:00,345
and you had on them tight pants,
you had a pencil stuck in the pocket?

483
00:27:00,415 --> 00:27:03,213
And then he fell.

484
00:27:03,285 --> 00:27:06,584
- Instant vasectomy.
- D'oh!

485
00:27:06,655 --> 00:27:09,624
That ain't funny.
I got lead poisoning...

486
00:27:09,691 --> 00:27:11,248
on my privacy.

487
00:27:11,325 --> 00:27:14,386
- Good one.
- You do look a little familiar.

488
00:27:14,463 --> 00:27:18,832
- Who's your mama?
- Oh, um... Madea.

489
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:20,925
Madea!

490
00:27:25,907 --> 00:27:28,899
- Brown, that's just nasty.
- Oh, you don't know my mother.

491
00:27:28,977 --> 00:27:31,537
You gonna roll up on me?
Hell to the no!

492
00:27:31,613 --> 00:27:33,410
I got my purse.
I got something for you.

493
00:27:33,482 --> 00:27:35,746
- Bring it!
- Don't go gospel gangster on her, baby.

494
00:27:35,817 --> 00:27:37,182
Just relax.
That's your Aunt Vera.

495
00:27:37,252 --> 00:27:39,049
What? Ain't no auntie of mine
acting like that.

496
00:27:39,121 --> 00:27:41,248
- She drinks and smokes.
- Sit down.

497
00:27:41,323 --> 00:27:43,314
- Sit down.
- You can't tell me to calm.

498
00:27:43,392 --> 00:27:45,917
- Please excuse my mother.
- Oh, this is your cousin Will.

499
00:27:45,994 --> 00:27:48,429
- He a doctor... a "gonorrheacologist."
- Oh!

500
00:27:49,798 --> 00:27:52,426
- A gynecologist.
- Oh, okay. Nice to meet you.

501
00:27:52,501 --> 00:27:54,197
Same thing.

502
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:56,669
Brown, I want to know
what these strangers

503
00:27:56,738 --> 00:27:59,229
are doing here
during our time of bereavement.

504
00:27:59,308 --> 00:28:02,801
- Vera, don't be so mean!
- How are y'all doing? I'm Will.

505
00:28:02,879 --> 00:28:05,439
- Vera's son.
- Hello.

506
00:28:05,515 --> 00:28:07,505
Who are you?
Now wait... hey hey hey!

507
00:28:07,582 --> 00:28:09,948
Hey, Brown,
this your daughter too?

508
00:28:12,021 --> 00:28:13,989
I'm Brenda
and this is Michael,

509
00:28:14,057 --> 00:28:16,115
Lena and Tosha.

510
00:28:16,191 --> 00:28:18,183
Brenda came down
for the funeral.

511
00:28:18,261 --> 00:28:20,923
- Where'd she come from?
- Chicago.

512
00:28:20,997 --> 00:28:24,591
Daddy! Daddy!

513
00:28:24,666 --> 00:28:27,931
- Okay, Ma.
- My daddy lived in Chicago long ago.

514
00:28:28,004 --> 00:28:29,835
Help me, Jesus!

515
00:28:29,906 --> 00:28:33,069
Come on, y'all. I'm gonna show you
where you're gonna sleep.

516
00:28:33,141 --> 00:28:35,872
- Oh, thank you.
- Just go on up the stairs

517
00:28:35,945 --> 00:28:38,470
- and turn to your left.
- See you later.

518
00:28:38,548 --> 00:28:40,038
- Good night.
- Mm-hmm.

519
00:28:40,116 --> 00:28:43,950
And, Vera, you all can sleep
in Pop Brown's old room.

520
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:48,218
Oh, now I ain't sleeping in some room
some dead man died in.

521
00:28:48,291 --> 00:28:51,351
I've been sleeping
with a dead man for years.

522
00:29:05,075 --> 00:29:08,567
- Hey!
- You following us or something?

523
00:29:10,012 --> 00:29:12,310
No. It's my hometown.
I live here.

524
00:29:12,382 --> 00:29:15,249
- What are you doing here?
- Minding my business.

525
00:29:15,318 --> 00:29:18,515
Oh yes, that's Harry.

526
00:29:18,588 --> 00:29:21,716
Yo, hey, Harry!

527
00:29:21,791 --> 00:29:23,656
- Hey, Mr. Brown.
- You doing all right?

528
00:29:23,726 --> 00:29:25,024
- Yeah.
- Yeah yeah yeah.

529
00:29:25,095 --> 00:29:26,857
Sorry to hear
about your daddy.

530
00:29:26,929 --> 00:29:29,830
Oh, it's okay. People's dying
that ain't never died before.

531
00:29:29,899 --> 00:29:31,891
Yeah, he's in a better place now.

532
00:29:31,969 --> 00:29:33,368
Mm-hmm, he gone to heaven.

533
00:29:33,437 --> 00:29:35,267
What's up, Harry?
How you doing, man?

534
00:29:35,338 --> 00:29:36,966
- Big Will!
- Long time no see.

535
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:39,167
- I know.
- Thanks for coming. What's going on?

536
00:29:39,243 --> 00:29:40,733
Just came by to pay
my condolences.

537
00:29:40,811 --> 00:29:42,676
Oh, you ain't got to pay
for nothing.

538
00:29:42,746 --> 00:29:44,508
We got $25,
everything is covered.

539
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:47,413
Yeah, Daddy left a big insurance
policy for that much.

540
00:29:47,484 --> 00:29:49,475
Hey, Mike, I was watching you
from upstairs.

541
00:29:49,553 --> 00:29:51,077
- You're pretty good.
- Oh, thanks.

542
00:29:51,155 --> 00:29:52,747
He just needs
to watch his elbow.

543
00:29:52,823 --> 00:29:54,347
Who are you to be
giving me advice?

544
00:29:54,425 --> 00:29:56,655
Mike, this is Harry Belton...

545
00:29:56,727 --> 00:29:59,252
high-school all-American,
college standout.

546
00:29:59,329 --> 00:30:01,730
And a pretty good professional player
until he retired.

547
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,633
- I ain't never heard of him.
- You ain't never heard of him?

548
00:30:04,702 --> 00:30:08,501
Where you been? All you know is that
young boy "Lebanon" James, ain't it?

549
00:30:08,572 --> 00:30:11,097
Gimme the basketball,
I'm gonna show you... whoa!

550
00:30:11,175 --> 00:30:13,939
- That's nice, Uncle Brown.
- You done scratched my suit.

551
00:30:15,947 --> 00:30:18,848
Harry's a high-school coach
here now and college recruiter

552
00:30:18,917 --> 00:30:21,909
and does camps and develops
talent over the summer, right?

553
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:24,454
- Yep.
- Oh, the coach of Hillbilly High, huh?

554
00:30:24,522 --> 00:30:26,113
Oooh, you're so "disrespected."

555
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:28,681
And arrogant.

556
00:30:28,759 --> 00:30:30,887
We've got some
talented kids like you.

557
00:30:30,962 --> 00:30:33,795
But they listen, so that would
make 'em better than you.

558
00:30:33,865 --> 00:30:36,356
Please.

559
00:30:36,434 --> 00:30:38,094
Oooh, you arrogant.

560
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:41,536
- Still got it.
- "Squish"!

561
00:30:41,606 --> 00:30:43,039
- "Squish."
- One on one.

562
00:30:43,107 --> 00:30:45,075
- Do it.
- All right.

563
00:30:45,143 --> 00:30:47,111
You got some money?

564
00:30:48,146 --> 00:30:50,046
I don't gamble.

565
00:30:50,114 --> 00:30:52,308
Me neither. I'm safe.
I'ma... I got knicks.

566
00:30:52,382 --> 00:30:55,648
I'm gonna change into my good clothes.
You don't know nothing about basketball.

567
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,687
Check it out.
Come on.

568
00:30:58,222 --> 00:31:00,714
Whoo, I'm just coming in here
to keep y'all company.

569
00:31:00,792 --> 00:31:03,488
Don't ask me to cook nothing.
Last time I was in the kitchen

570
00:31:03,561 --> 00:31:05,392
I burned myself
and cut myself.

571
00:31:07,398 --> 00:31:10,367
Child, slow down.
Dinner gonna be in a while.

572
00:31:10,435 --> 00:31:13,233
Vera, don't start.

573
00:31:13,304 --> 00:31:17,798
- Your mama don't feed you?
- Sometimes we don't have enough to eat.

574
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:22,313
- Really?
- Well, you just eat all you want here.

575
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:24,110
You hear?
We got plenty.

576
00:31:24,183 --> 00:31:25,809
That's right.
Miss Sarah's a great cook.

577
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:27,749
Look like you been
eating here for years.

578
00:31:27,819 --> 00:31:29,081
Oh look, you don't know me.

579
00:31:29,153 --> 00:31:30,950
- You gonna make me go in my purse.
- Do it.

580
00:31:31,022 --> 00:31:32,752
- Don't hurt me, baby.
- You want some more, baby?

581
00:31:32,825 --> 00:31:36,453
I'd love to, but I gotta save
some for my sister and brother.

582
00:31:36,528 --> 00:31:38,963
Well, it look like you ate it all.

583
00:31:39,031 --> 00:31:41,795
Oooh, wow.

584
00:31:41,867 --> 00:31:44,427
Something sure smells good.

585
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:47,868
- Uh, Mom?
- Yeah, baby?

586
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:50,374
I didn't mean to eat it all.

587
00:31:50,442 --> 00:31:52,672
It was just so good.
I'm sorry.

588
00:31:52,745 --> 00:31:54,507
Oh, honey, don't be upset.

589
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:57,105
Old mean Vera here
was just kidding.

590
00:31:57,181 --> 00:32:00,207
We got plenty.

591
00:32:00,285 --> 00:32:02,117
Tosha, sweetheart,

592
00:32:02,187 --> 00:32:04,417
do me a favor,
go check on your sister.

593
00:32:06,457 --> 00:32:08,323
- So sweet.
- Yeah.

594
00:32:08,394 --> 00:32:10,419
I'm sorry. We've just been
having it...

595
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:12,293
- kinda rough lately.
- Mm-hmm.

596
00:32:12,364 --> 00:32:14,696
Well, get up there.
Have a seat. Sit down, honey.

597
00:32:14,767 --> 00:32:16,632
- Take a load off.
- Come on.

598
00:32:16,702 --> 00:32:19,000
- Thank you.
- Here.

599
00:32:19,071 --> 00:32:21,699
Oh, thanks.

600
00:32:21,774 --> 00:32:25,437
I lost my job lately, but even
before then, it was... it was...

601
00:32:25,511 --> 00:32:27,536
it was kinda tough.

602
00:32:27,613 --> 00:32:30,548
- God will make a way. Won't He, Sarah?
- Mm-hmm.

603
00:32:30,616 --> 00:32:32,380
Sure wanna believe that.

604
00:32:32,452 --> 00:32:36,444
You must believe it, baby,
and don't you be ashamed to speak out.

605
00:32:36,522 --> 00:32:38,786
We got your back.

606
00:32:38,857 --> 00:32:41,883
'Cause I remember when my
husband died, if it wasn't for family,

607
00:32:41,961 --> 00:32:44,521
I don't know how me and my two girls
would have made it.

608
00:32:44,597 --> 00:32:46,589
I don't have much family.

609
00:32:46,666 --> 00:32:49,794
- Where these kids' daddy at?
- They're not in our lives.

610
00:32:49,869 --> 00:32:52,235
- They?!
- Vera.

611
00:32:54,039 --> 00:32:55,905
- Yeah, they.
- As in...

612
00:32:55,976 --> 00:32:58,137
more than one?

613
00:32:58,211 --> 00:33:00,805
- Three.
- Vera.

614
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:03,440
Stay out of her business.

615
00:33:03,516 --> 00:33:05,449
Well...

616
00:33:05,517 --> 00:33:08,452
I wasn't trying to get in her business.
I'm gonna help her out.

617
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,648
Here, this should help
you get a little bit.

618
00:33:10,724 --> 00:33:14,090
- Uh, no no no. I can't take that.
- It's the South, baby.

619
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:15,991
You can take it.
It'll help out a little bit.

620
00:33:16,062 --> 00:33:17,654
No no no, thank you.

621
00:33:19,566 --> 00:33:21,659
I'm gonna go
check on my kids.

622
00:33:25,572 --> 00:33:29,702
Vera! $10, Vera? $10!

623
00:33:29,776 --> 00:33:31,607
What is she gonna do
with $10, Vera?

624
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:35,011
First of all, she gonna buy
that kid a box of perm.

625
00:33:35,081 --> 00:33:38,312
- You see that child's head?!
- She has dreads.

626
00:33:38,385 --> 00:33:40,819
Dreads.
Let me spell that for you:

627
00:33:40,887 --> 00:33:44,118
N-A-P-P-Y.
Pshh!

628
00:33:47,827 --> 00:33:49,523
Uh-oh, watch the tree.

629
00:33:49,596 --> 00:33:51,565
All right, this game's points.

630
00:33:53,033 --> 00:33:55,264
- Be nice to him. Don't be...
- Whoa whoa whoa.

631
00:33:55,336 --> 00:33:57,827
- Oh!
- Oooh!

632
00:33:57,905 --> 00:34:00,465
What happened?

633
00:34:00,541 --> 00:34:02,735
- Oh, I see what happened.
- Hey!

634
00:34:02,809 --> 00:34:05,004
- Did you win?
- You know it, Mama.

635
00:34:05,078 --> 00:34:06,478
Aw, that's my baby.

636
00:34:06,547 --> 00:34:08,070
You said you want some of this?

637
00:34:08,148 --> 00:34:10,878
I got on my clothes,
my basketball clothes. You ready?

638
00:34:10,950 --> 00:34:12,816
Come on.
Gimme the ball.

639
00:34:12,887 --> 00:34:15,856
You... don't stand there
looking like you ain't never seen this.

640
00:34:15,923 --> 00:34:18,790
Come on.
You wanna play?

641
00:34:21,262 --> 00:34:22,489
Hey.

642
00:34:23,898 --> 00:34:25,023
Hey.

643
00:34:25,098 --> 00:34:27,363
Harry, Brenda;
Brenda, Harry.

644
00:34:27,435 --> 00:34:28,868
Harry's a friend of the family.

645
00:34:28,936 --> 00:34:30,836
- We met already.
- Oh yeah?

646
00:34:30,905 --> 00:34:33,135
In Chicago. She kicked me
out of her house...

647
00:34:33,207 --> 00:34:36,040
when I told her her son had
potential to play pro ball.

648
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:37,873
And what, you didn't
believe him?

649
00:34:37,945 --> 00:34:39,936
If Harry says it's true,
then it's the truth.

650
00:34:40,014 --> 00:34:41,982
So, what, you decided
to stalk us?

651
00:34:42,049 --> 00:34:44,074
No.

652
00:34:44,151 --> 00:34:46,244
- This is where I live.
- What?

653
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,083
Harry, you see him foul me?

654
00:34:48,155 --> 00:34:50,180
You fouled me. Didn't...
you seen him, Harry?

655
00:34:50,257 --> 00:34:51,781
He fouled me.
You hit me on the leg.

656
00:34:51,859 --> 00:34:53,724
Excuse me.
Let me go ref this game.

657
00:34:55,362 --> 00:34:56,590
Game point!

658
00:34:56,664 --> 00:34:58,723
I'd still like to take
you out to lunch.

659
00:34:58,799 --> 00:35:01,131
Dinner's ready, you guys.

660
00:35:01,202 --> 00:35:02,727
That's my cue.
I'm coming, Cora!

661
00:35:02,804 --> 00:35:04,566
Ooh.

662
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:09,575
Michael, come on. It's time
for dinner. I need you to wash up.

663
00:35:09,643 --> 00:35:13,545
- All right.
- It was really good seeing you again.

664
00:35:14,850 --> 00:35:16,282
Harry.

665
00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:18,784
- Huh?
- Harry.

666
00:35:18,853 --> 00:35:21,186
Harry.

667
00:35:21,255 --> 00:35:23,588
Sly dog. Ha ha ha!

668
00:35:23,658 --> 00:35:25,853
- I'll talk to you after dinner.
- Whoa whoa whoa!

669
00:35:25,927 --> 00:35:27,359
Man, hey hey.

670
00:35:27,428 --> 00:35:29,761
You didn't hear that?

671
00:35:29,831 --> 00:35:32,356
What, is that your way of asking
to stay for dinner?

672
00:35:32,434 --> 00:35:35,096
- Why, thank you.
- Whoa whoa whoa.

673
00:35:36,872 --> 00:35:40,273
If you trying to holler at her, man, you
need to come out of that sweaty shirt.

674
00:35:40,342 --> 00:35:42,310
Right.

675
00:35:42,377 --> 00:35:44,572
- I'll be right back.
- All right.

676
00:35:44,646 --> 00:35:46,375
Hey, I'll save you a seat.

677
00:35:46,448 --> 00:35:49,747
- Hey, right next to her.
- All right.

678
00:35:49,818 --> 00:35:52,912
And that was when we all
cried like babies.

679
00:35:52,988 --> 00:35:55,218
You don't know how
to tell no stories.

680
00:35:55,290 --> 00:35:57,690
L.B., Vera, y'all remember when

681
00:35:57,759 --> 00:35:59,625
Daddy tried to teach us
how to swim?

682
00:35:59,694 --> 00:36:01,787
- No, I don't remember that.
- Oh, I remember.

683
00:36:01,863 --> 00:36:04,491
I remember it because it was
like it was yesterday.

684
00:36:04,566 --> 00:36:08,969
I remember it was
Christmas Eve, 19...

685
00:36:09,037 --> 00:36:10,095
1940-something,
whatever.

686
00:36:10,172 --> 00:36:11,799
I remember.

687
00:36:11,873 --> 00:36:13,671
Daddy said he couldn't get us
nothing for Christmas.

688
00:36:13,743 --> 00:36:15,835
So he come in and he said,
"I'm gonna get the truck ready."

689
00:36:15,911 --> 00:36:18,106
- He loaded up horse on the truck.
- Uh-huh.

690
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:19,842
You know, we ain't have
no engine in the truck.

691
00:36:19,916 --> 00:36:22,680
We just had a, you know,
old one-horsepower truck.

692
00:36:22,752 --> 00:36:24,116
- That was the horse.
- Giddy-up.

693
00:36:24,186 --> 00:36:25,654
Yeah, giddy-up, giddy-up.

694
00:36:25,721 --> 00:36:29,054
We went down to that river.
I didn't want to jump in right off.

695
00:36:29,125 --> 00:36:30,956
That water was 50-below zero!

696
00:36:31,027 --> 00:36:32,960
- Whoo!
- Sho'nuff.

697
00:36:33,028 --> 00:36:35,929
Daddy got out there and he said,
"Get in the water!"

698
00:36:35,997 --> 00:36:38,192
And I said, "I ain't
getting in that water!"

699
00:36:38,266 --> 00:36:40,235
And he looked at me, he had
an extension cord in his hand.

700
00:36:40,303 --> 00:36:41,769
I didn't want to be no disobedient.

701
00:36:41,838 --> 00:36:44,465
So I got to that water
and I looked at it,

702
00:36:44,539 --> 00:36:48,032
and I teenched up there
and then I teeter-tottered.

703
00:36:48,110 --> 00:36:49,974
- Whoo.
- I teeter-tottered.

704
00:36:50,045 --> 00:36:52,708
Teeter-totter, next thing
you know...

705
00:36:52,782 --> 00:36:54,545
bang!

706
00:36:56,185 --> 00:36:58,710
I never learned to swim.

707
00:36:58,788 --> 00:37:01,416
I couldn't get the rhythm
of the stroke.

708
00:37:01,490 --> 00:37:04,482
Why is it that I felt
that I might choke?

709
00:37:04,561 --> 00:37:07,688
Mr. Brown is crazy.

710
00:37:07,763 --> 00:37:10,960
Harry, how is your mother?

711
00:37:11,033 --> 00:37:13,661
- She's good.
- Uh-huh.

712
00:37:13,736 --> 00:37:16,535
I'm glad she's good 'cause I know
she almost had a heart attack

713
00:37:16,606 --> 00:37:19,575
when she heard about all that trouble
you were in with all that illegal...

714
00:37:19,642 --> 00:37:21,234
Mama! Want some cake?

715
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:23,244
Gimme the part
where they got that rum

716
00:37:23,312 --> 00:37:26,145
sopped up in there. Gimme that piece.
Gimme just that rum piece.

717
00:37:26,215 --> 00:37:27,706
I'm just glad to see you all right

718
00:37:27,784 --> 00:37:30,514
'cause I was praying for you.

719
00:37:30,587 --> 00:37:32,713
That prayer didn't get
no higher than the ceiling.

720
00:37:34,490 --> 00:37:37,085
- Mom.
- What, baby?

721
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:39,458
- I got a tummy ache.
- Oh, honey,

722
00:37:39,529 --> 00:37:41,520
that's probably
because you ate too much.

723
00:37:41,598 --> 00:37:44,191
- Let me get you something.
- Don't worry about it, Ma.

724
00:37:44,268 --> 00:37:46,132
- I'll take care of her.
- Thank you.

725
00:37:46,202 --> 00:37:48,296
Young man, you know
where you going?

726
00:37:48,372 --> 00:37:50,363
Oh, yes, sir.
Excuse me a minute.

727
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:52,430
Come on, Mike.

728
00:37:52,508 --> 00:37:53,874
All right. Night, baby.

729
00:37:53,944 --> 00:37:54,968
- Good night.
- Night.

730
00:37:55,044 --> 00:37:56,444
- Night.
- Later, Mike.

731
00:37:56,513 --> 00:37:59,573
Brenda, he seems like
such a nice young man.

732
00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:01,173
Thank you. He is.

733
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:02,912
I couldn't make it without him.

734
00:38:03,086 --> 00:38:05,452
You know what? Now just a minute,
just a minute.

735
00:38:05,522 --> 00:38:09,481
I'm just curious. Anybody else at this
table want to know who this woman is?

736
00:38:09,559 --> 00:38:14,155
- Vera!
- All day y'all been skirting the issue.

737
00:38:14,231 --> 00:38:16,461
I want to know
who this woman is.

738
00:38:16,533 --> 00:38:19,127
- Mama...
- No no, uh uh uh uh!

739
00:38:19,202 --> 00:38:21,398
Who are you?

740
00:38:27,312 --> 00:38:29,040
Well, um...

741
00:38:29,112 --> 00:38:33,049
apparently Pop Brown
was my daddy.

742
00:38:33,117 --> 00:38:35,141
- What?
- Huh-uh, you's a liar.

743
00:38:35,218 --> 00:38:36,913
Apparently nothing.
You a liar!

744
00:38:36,987 --> 00:38:38,751
Huh-uh, the devil is a liar.

745
00:38:38,823 --> 00:38:42,281
Oh, hell to the no.
My daddy wasn't no rolling stone.

746
00:38:42,359 --> 00:38:44,055
Well, that's what
my mama said.

747
00:38:44,128 --> 00:38:46,790
- Who's your mama?
- Her name was Carol Cassidy.

748
00:38:46,864 --> 00:38:48,387
I don't know no Cassidy.
Who's that?

749
00:38:49,968 --> 00:38:51,798
I ain't got no reason
not to tell the truth.

750
00:38:51,868 --> 00:38:54,166
W-wait a minute.
I got something.

751
00:38:54,237 --> 00:38:56,570
Yeah, let's see what you got.

752
00:38:56,641 --> 00:38:58,905
Look at her.
She does look just like us.

753
00:38:58,977 --> 00:39:01,707
Look, I'm the baby of this family.
She ain't coming up in here.

754
00:39:01,779 --> 00:39:04,407
All that attitude and carrying on.
"We're from Chicago."

755
00:39:04,482 --> 00:39:06,142
What you got, girl?

756
00:39:06,216 --> 00:39:08,879
I got this letter and it
told me to come down here.

757
00:39:08,952 --> 00:39:11,251
Let me see this.
It's L.B.'s writing.

758
00:39:11,322 --> 00:39:13,415
- L.B., what the hell is this?
- L. B?

759
00:39:13,491 --> 00:39:15,823
- What the hell is it?
- What's going on, L. B?

760
00:39:15,893 --> 00:39:19,294
- Yeah, L.B., what's going on?
- I know all about this.

761
00:39:19,364 --> 00:39:22,094
Papa Brown been talking
to you about her?

762
00:39:22,166 --> 00:39:24,464
Yes, her and her mother.

763
00:39:24,535 --> 00:39:26,629
You see, when Pop Brown
got real sick,

764
00:39:26,704 --> 00:39:30,401
he started to tell me everything
about his past life.

765
00:39:30,475 --> 00:39:34,468
You know, before he got saved
and became a deacon.

766
00:39:34,545 --> 00:39:36,342
So you mean to tell me...

767
00:39:36,414 --> 00:39:38,474
you have a sister?

768
00:39:38,549 --> 00:39:40,483
Yep, and her mother

769
00:39:40,551 --> 00:39:42,951
was the love of his life
in Chicago.

770
00:39:43,021 --> 00:39:44,613
Oh, really?

771
00:39:44,689 --> 00:39:46,851
- Mm-hmm, yeah.
- Huh-uh-uh!

772
00:39:46,925 --> 00:39:49,119
'Cause I don't agree.
What are you saying?

773
00:39:49,194 --> 00:39:51,753
You see, when Pop Brown
was in Chicago,

774
00:39:51,829 --> 00:39:53,456
he was a pimp.

775
00:39:53,531 --> 00:39:56,500
And her mother was
his bottom ho.

776
00:39:56,567 --> 00:39:58,934
You don't talk
about my daddy.

777
00:39:59,004 --> 00:40:01,199
Hell to the no,
this is blasphemy.

778
00:40:01,273 --> 00:40:04,674
L.B., you don't talk about my daddy
like this, not at the dinner table.

779
00:40:04,743 --> 00:40:08,234
- Our daddy was a saint.
- Your daddy was a pimp!

780
00:40:10,049 --> 00:40:13,416
He was not a pim... my daddy
used to date nice women.

781
00:40:13,485 --> 00:40:15,453
- Remember sweet Sadie?
- Yes.

782
00:40:15,521 --> 00:40:18,115
- Good girl.
- She was one of his whores.

783
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:21,626
- Ho ho.
- What about Agnes with the freckles?

784
00:40:21,693 --> 00:40:23,558
She was a good girl... Agnes.

785
00:40:25,497 --> 00:40:27,055
Freckle-faced ho.

786
00:40:27,132 --> 00:40:29,032
What about Arnette?

787
00:40:30,402 --> 00:40:33,633
- Latin ho.
- What about Tommy Lee?

788
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:37,206
- Backdoor whore.
- What about Shirley?

789
00:40:37,276 --> 00:40:40,006
Shirley, the one that used to make
cupcakes for me when I was a child.

790
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:42,809
Please don't tell me Shirley was no ho.
What about Shirley?

791
00:40:42,881 --> 00:40:45,679
- City ho.
- Miss Edna?

792
00:40:45,751 --> 00:40:48,219
She's a double ho.

793
00:40:48,287 --> 00:40:51,381
What about L.B. mama?

794
00:40:54,293 --> 00:40:55,590
L. B?

795
00:40:55,661 --> 00:40:59,859
Nasty ho.

796
00:40:59,932 --> 00:41:02,298
Ain't nothing going
on here but the truth.

797
00:41:06,272 --> 00:41:08,832
Brenda, you sure you okay?

798
00:41:08,908 --> 00:41:10,568
Oh yeah. I'll be fine.

799
00:41:10,642 --> 00:41:12,907
But it's a good thing
this funeral's tomorrow

800
00:41:12,979 --> 00:41:16,539
- so I can get out of here.
- Let me welcome you to the Brown family.

801
00:41:16,615 --> 00:41:20,780
- Some welcome.
- I know it.

802
00:41:20,854 --> 00:41:23,186
This is getting pretty full.
I should take it out.

803
00:41:23,256 --> 00:41:24,984
Oh, okay. You sure
you want to do that?

804
00:41:25,057 --> 00:41:27,151
- Yeah, where?
- Just take it right out front.

805
00:41:31,364 --> 00:41:33,798
Ladies, I'm gonna say
good night.

806
00:41:33,866 --> 00:41:37,030
- Well, good night.
- Nice meeting you.

807
00:41:37,103 --> 00:41:39,469
Nice meeting you too.

808
00:41:45,745 --> 00:41:48,077
- Hey, let me help you with that.
- Oh, I got it.

809
00:41:48,148 --> 00:41:50,878
Around here men do that.

810
00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:53,350
Where I'm from women do it all.

811
00:41:58,091 --> 00:42:00,424
Well, then maybe
you should live here.

812
00:42:00,493 --> 00:42:02,427
God forbid.

813
00:42:02,495 --> 00:42:05,693
What?
What's wrong with my town?

814
00:42:05,766 --> 00:42:09,065
- You call this a town?
- Yeah.

815
00:42:09,136 --> 00:42:11,570
It's calming.

816
00:42:11,639 --> 00:42:13,265
It's too quiet here.

817
00:42:13,339 --> 00:42:16,137
Then maybe you should let me
show you how great a town it is.

818
00:42:16,209 --> 00:42:20,078
You know, I'm here for my father's funeral
and you're flirting with me.

819
00:42:20,147 --> 00:42:22,307
That is in poor taste.

820
00:42:22,382 --> 00:42:24,509
- Yeah.
- I'm sorry.

821
00:42:26,487 --> 00:42:28,580
Good night.

822
00:42:28,656 --> 00:42:30,350
Good night.

823
00:42:45,906 --> 00:42:49,865
Well, we are here today to say

824
00:42:49,944 --> 00:42:52,879
- goodbye...
- Lord, that's my daddy!

825
00:42:52,947 --> 00:42:54,881
...to one of our dear
beloved sons.

826
00:42:54,949 --> 00:42:56,974
Daddy, you should've
let me go with you!

827
00:42:57,051 --> 00:42:58,712
Daddy!

828
00:42:58,786 --> 00:43:02,154
Mom, Mom, take it easy.
Sit down, Mom.

829
00:43:02,224 --> 00:43:04,191
And I need you to understand

830
00:43:04,258 --> 00:43:07,888
that God will see you
through all this, sister.

831
00:43:10,966 --> 00:43:13,024
What the hell does
he got on his head?

832
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:16,593
- And you must realize that...
- Monster, Mama, monster.

833
00:43:16,671 --> 00:43:20,004
- Baby, it's all right.
...in this hour of bereavement,

834
00:43:20,075 --> 00:43:23,407
there is such
a word as comfort.

835
00:43:23,477 --> 00:43:26,310
Yeah, Southern Comfort!
Yes, sir!

836
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:29,043
- Hmph.
- And God is faithful

837
00:43:29,117 --> 00:43:32,847
- to do exactly what he says he's gonna do.
- Preacher? Excuse me, Pastor?

838
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:35,354
He do, He do!

839
00:43:35,422 --> 00:43:36,617
Psst!

840
00:43:36,691 --> 00:43:38,419
- l...
- Put me on the program.

841
00:43:38,492 --> 00:43:40,586
I wanted to say something
about my daddy.

842
00:43:40,662 --> 00:43:43,426
- Don't, please.
- You can put me on program.

843
00:43:43,498 --> 00:43:45,261
I'm trying to do
the sermon, please.

844
00:43:45,333 --> 00:43:48,268
- I'm preaching right now.
- You ain't doing no...

845
00:43:48,336 --> 00:43:50,827
you ain't doing no good job.
You're boring everybody.

846
00:43:50,905 --> 00:43:53,465
Look at my daddy's face.

847
00:43:55,243 --> 00:43:58,337
Deacon, he dead.

848
00:43:58,413 --> 00:44:00,904
- Put me on the program.
- I need to finish my sermon.

849
00:44:00,982 --> 00:44:03,143
- Remember that...
- Psst!

850
00:44:03,218 --> 00:44:05,846
You can let me say something
about my daddy. He my daddy.

851
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:08,582
- Is he your daddy? Act like he your daddy.
- All right.

852
00:44:08,657 --> 00:44:10,818
- Just put me on the program.
- Come on.

853
00:44:10,892 --> 00:44:12,723
- Oh, Daddy!
- All right.

854
00:44:12,794 --> 00:44:15,092
Now I have more to say,
but right now

855
00:44:15,163 --> 00:44:17,256
his son Leroy Brown

856
00:44:17,332 --> 00:44:19,823
has a few words
that he wants to say.

857
00:44:19,901 --> 00:44:22,495
Leroy Brown, come on
and say something

858
00:44:22,570 --> 00:44:23,832
right up on that.

859
00:44:23,905 --> 00:44:25,532
- Me?
- Oh yes.

860
00:44:25,607 --> 00:44:27,542
- What?
- Let's go. Come on now.

861
00:44:27,610 --> 00:44:29,941
- Shut your mouth. Is he sure?
- Yes, Deacon.

862
00:44:30,011 --> 00:44:32,571
- They want me to say something?
- Come on up here, Deacon.

863
00:44:32,647 --> 00:44:33,910
I don't know what to say.

864
00:44:33,983 --> 00:44:35,677
You want me to say
something, L. B?

865
00:44:35,750 --> 00:44:38,241
- Till we all dead.
- Okay.

866
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:40,584
I'm "nerveless."

867
00:44:40,655 --> 00:44:44,284
I didn't plan on saying
nothing today.

868
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:48,160
I just was in my room and I
jotted down a few things.

869
00:44:48,230 --> 00:44:50,994
- Can y'all hear me?
- Go on, Brown. Go on, baby.

870
00:44:51,067 --> 00:44:53,865
Is this on?

871
00:44:53,936 --> 00:44:55,527
It's on.

872
00:44:55,603 --> 00:44:59,199
I didn't plan on saying nothing.
Let the church say "amend."

873
00:44:59,275 --> 00:45:03,507
- Amen.
- Let the church say "amend" again.

874
00:45:03,579 --> 00:45:05,206
Amen.

875
00:45:05,281 --> 00:45:09,217
I want to let everybody know
today that Daddy died happy.

876
00:45:09,285 --> 00:45:12,311
He was happy...
I'm gonna miss my daddy.

877
00:45:12,388 --> 00:45:14,049
Bye-bye, Daddy.

878
00:45:14,123 --> 00:45:16,023
My daddy loved his people...

879
00:45:16,092 --> 00:45:20,051
I'm getting sick of this. It don't take nobody
that long to put nobody in the ground.

880
00:45:20,129 --> 00:45:22,962
- Stay calm, stay calm.
- I am calm. I'm just sick of it.

881
00:45:23,032 --> 00:45:26,024
He'll always be right here, y'all,

882
00:45:26,102 --> 00:45:27,592
right here in my heart.

883
00:45:27,670 --> 00:45:31,162
And I won't chatter no...
this ain't no funeral.

884
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:33,470
- This is a "celebrate."
- Yeah!

885
00:45:33,542 --> 00:45:35,977
And we here to celebrate Daddy.

886
00:45:36,046 --> 00:45:38,206
And I'm telling y'all today,

887
00:45:38,281 --> 00:45:41,182
- my daddy was a happy man.
- Sit down!

888
00:45:41,251 --> 00:45:43,514
- That's what we need...
- Sit down, Brown!

889
00:45:43,586 --> 00:45:46,384
- more superheroes in this church.
We need peoples

890
00:45:46,455 --> 00:45:48,855
that'll stand up and be
heroes for the Lord.

891
00:45:48,924 --> 00:45:51,586
- That's enough.
- Show him, baby.

892
00:45:52,963 --> 00:45:54,930
Oh God.

893
00:45:54,997 --> 00:45:57,329
I gotta stop smoking.

894
00:45:57,400 --> 00:46:00,836
# Amazing #

895
00:46:00,903 --> 00:46:04,237
# Gra-a-a-ace #

896
00:46:04,307 --> 00:46:07,538
# How sweet, yes #

897
00:46:07,611 --> 00:46:09,875
# The sound... #

898
00:46:09,946 --> 00:46:13,006
One more time, Sarah.
She got one more time.

899
00:46:13,083 --> 00:46:16,541
Jesus, why?
Tell me why?

900
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:20,351
That's it. Vera's really getting
on my nerves.

901
00:46:20,424 --> 00:46:23,291
# That saves... #

902
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:28,730
# A wre-eeee-etch #

903
00:46:28,799 --> 00:46:32,429
# Like me-eee... #

904
00:46:35,639 --> 00:46:38,074
- Uncle L. B!
- L.B., what's wrong with you?

905
00:46:38,142 --> 00:46:40,439
You wanna go with her?
There's room for you too, you know?

906
00:46:40,510 --> 00:46:42,171
I'll wait.

907
00:46:43,815 --> 00:46:47,341
I'm the baby of this family
and I deserve some respect.

908
00:46:47,417 --> 00:46:49,818
- Right.
- L.B. pushed me in that grave.

909
00:46:49,961 --> 00:46:51,359
I know, Mama. I know.

910
00:46:51,428 --> 00:46:53,589
Everybody's act a fool.

911
00:46:53,664 --> 00:46:56,633
Should have let them put the dirt
on you too... acting a damn fool.

912
00:46:56,700 --> 00:46:59,033
- Calm down, everybody.
- That's just crazy!

913
00:46:59,104 --> 00:47:00,400
Uh, hey, y'all.

914
00:47:00,471 --> 00:47:02,735
It was nice meeting
all of you, but, um...

915
00:47:02,806 --> 00:47:04,672
- I think we're gonna go now.
- Oh no.

916
00:47:04,743 --> 00:47:08,303
You have to stay till tomorrow
for the reading of the will.

917
00:47:08,379 --> 00:47:11,041
- Yeah.
- No! Daddy ain't left her nothing.

918
00:47:13,084 --> 00:47:16,247
No, um, I really think
we ought to be going.

919
00:47:16,321 --> 00:47:18,346
You can't leave, baby,

920
00:47:18,423 --> 00:47:21,756
'cause... the bus only
come every three days.

921
00:47:21,826 --> 00:47:24,761
- It'll be here tomorrow.
- Tomorrow, what?

922
00:47:24,829 --> 00:47:27,389
- It'll be okay.
- No no!

923
00:47:27,465 --> 00:47:29,797
I gotta go.
l... no...

924
00:47:29,868 --> 00:47:31,961
You know what?
You know what I'm gonna do?

925
00:47:32,037 --> 00:47:34,699
I'm gonna go change and I'm gonna
be back in 15 minutes.

926
00:47:34,773 --> 00:47:36,741
I'm gonna take you
and your kids

927
00:47:36,808 --> 00:47:39,106
to see my town.

928
00:47:42,147 --> 00:47:43,705
Ah... you'll like it.

929
00:47:43,782 --> 00:47:46,979
- I promise.
- Okay okay okay.

930
00:47:47,052 --> 00:47:49,317
- Okay, all right. Okay, all right.
- 15 minutes.

931
00:47:49,388 --> 00:47:51,856
- All right.
- Oh my God.

932
00:47:51,924 --> 00:47:54,984
All right, you know
I don't know you that well,

933
00:47:55,061 --> 00:47:57,655
but you'd better
watch out for him. Pshaw!

934
00:47:57,730 --> 00:48:00,255
Flashing that pretty smile...

935
00:48:00,333 --> 00:48:02,800
and that nickel-slick talk.

936
00:48:02,867 --> 00:48:06,429
He done broke a lot of women's hearts
out here in these backwoods.

937
00:48:08,908 --> 00:48:11,432
You be careful... sister.

938
00:48:11,510 --> 00:48:14,069
Brenda.

939
00:48:14,145 --> 00:48:15,909
Brown, where you all at?

940
00:48:15,982 --> 00:48:17,005
We over here.

941
00:48:17,082 --> 00:48:19,243
Where that money
you owe me?

942
00:48:20,686 --> 00:48:22,209
- I'm gonna give you two.
- Thank you.

943
00:48:22,287 --> 00:48:24,586
Thank you. Gracias.

944
00:48:24,657 --> 00:48:26,784
You didn't know
I spoke Spanish, did you?

945
00:48:26,859 --> 00:48:29,123
Oooh, you should have
got one.

946
00:48:29,195 --> 00:48:30,889
See, it's not so bad.

947
00:48:30,962 --> 00:48:33,329
Hey, Harry.

948
00:48:35,835 --> 00:48:37,359
- Hey.
- Mmm.

949
00:48:37,436 --> 00:48:39,404
One of your women?

950
00:48:39,472 --> 00:48:42,134
- No, it's my cousin.
- Oh.

951
00:48:42,208 --> 00:48:45,143
That don't mean nothing
down here, do it?

952
00:48:46,412 --> 00:48:48,404
Oh ho.

953
00:48:48,482 --> 00:48:50,574
That's cold.

954
00:48:50,650 --> 00:48:53,642
I'm kidding.

955
00:48:53,719 --> 00:48:56,313
- Hi, Mommy!
- Hi, Mommy!

956
00:48:56,389 --> 00:48:59,324
Hi, baby! Oh.

957
00:48:59,392 --> 00:49:01,121
They're having fun.

958
00:49:01,193 --> 00:49:03,593
Yeah.

959
00:49:06,365 --> 00:49:08,664
Why don't you have
a woman, anyway?

960
00:49:08,735 --> 00:49:11,431
- Huh?
- I'm divorced.

961
00:49:11,505 --> 00:49:13,438
Ooooh.

962
00:49:13,506 --> 00:49:15,974
Six years, three kids

963
00:49:16,042 --> 00:49:18,068
and a whole lot of drama.

964
00:49:18,145 --> 00:49:20,136
My drama trumps your drama.

965
00:49:26,687 --> 00:49:29,155
Hey, step right up,
step right up.

966
00:49:29,222 --> 00:49:32,316
Who can get the ball in the basket?
How about you, young man?

967
00:49:32,392 --> 00:49:34,257
- Huh huh?
- Hey, Harry?

968
00:49:34,327 --> 00:49:35,851
Yeah, you there, sir.

969
00:49:37,998 --> 00:49:39,625
Get the ball in the basket,

970
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:42,430
you can win a cute little doll
for the lovely lady back there.

971
00:49:42,502 --> 00:49:45,437
- Maybe you're scared.
- You got some money?

972
00:49:45,505 --> 00:49:48,668
The young man's going to clean
me out of all my profits.

973
00:49:48,742 --> 00:49:51,370
I'm in, but I'll just play.
Not for money.

974
00:49:52,646 --> 00:49:54,637
- Run it.
- How about every one we win

975
00:49:54,715 --> 00:49:56,080
you buy back from us?

976
00:49:56,149 --> 00:49:58,310
All right.

977
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:01,817
Keep that elbow in, all right?

978
00:50:02,923 --> 00:50:04,322
That's what I'm talking, dawg.

979
00:50:04,391 --> 00:50:06,689
- Bing bing bing.
- Oh ho ho!

980
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:08,058
That's good form.

981
00:50:08,129 --> 00:50:10,562
That's the difference
right there, man.

982
00:50:10,630 --> 00:50:12,564
Come on, man, get some more,
get some more animals, man...

983
00:50:12,632 --> 00:50:15,658
- Oh, man, look at you.
- Too easy.

984
00:50:20,241 --> 00:50:23,074
- Tosha, take this in the house for Mama.
- Okay.

985
00:50:23,144 --> 00:50:25,112
Hey, wait up.

986
00:50:30,585 --> 00:50:33,280
Hey, man, here's your cut.

987
00:50:33,353 --> 00:50:35,821
Oh no, you keep it.

988
00:50:38,291 --> 00:50:40,385
Thanks.

989
00:50:44,899 --> 00:50:46,867
Think I'm winning him over.

990
00:50:46,933 --> 00:50:49,402
Don't be so sure about that.

991
00:50:51,472 --> 00:50:54,964
He hasn't really had
a real man in his life.

992
00:50:55,042 --> 00:50:57,875
And I sure can't afford
to let another one come running in

993
00:50:57,945 --> 00:50:59,936
and out of it.

994
00:51:05,319 --> 00:51:08,914
Is it his life or your life
we're talking about?

995
00:51:08,990 --> 00:51:10,685
What?

996
00:51:10,758 --> 00:51:13,125
I don't know who
you're protecting, you or him.

997
00:51:16,064 --> 00:51:18,965
Both of us, I guess.

998
00:51:21,837 --> 00:51:23,303
I see.

999
00:51:23,371 --> 00:51:25,703
You really think
he's that good?

1000
00:51:28,177 --> 00:51:29,609
I do.

1001
00:51:29,677 --> 00:51:33,170
Well, how would that work?
I mean, how would you coach him?

1002
00:51:33,248 --> 00:51:35,647
I mean, you're here.
He's with me in Chicago.

1003
00:51:35,716 --> 00:51:38,241
And look, he's not
moving down here.

1004
00:51:38,319 --> 00:51:40,184
I can make a few trips up there,

1005
00:51:40,254 --> 00:51:42,587
give him some drills.

1006
00:51:42,658 --> 00:51:45,218
Maybe in the summer,
he can do a camp

1007
00:51:45,294 --> 00:51:47,524
with me and some
of the other players.

1008
00:51:47,596 --> 00:51:51,430
Hmm, what about
his education?

1009
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:53,058
I promise you

1010
00:51:53,135 --> 00:51:56,536
he'll come back
smarter than he left.

1011
00:51:59,374 --> 00:52:03,174
Yeah, well, I'll think about it.

1012
00:52:03,245 --> 00:52:05,475
- Take your time.
- I have to ask him.

1013
00:52:05,547 --> 00:52:08,516
Yeah, do that.

1014
00:52:10,586 --> 00:52:12,451
Hey, thank you for the day.

1015
00:52:12,521 --> 00:52:14,489
I really appreciate it.

1016
00:52:14,556 --> 00:52:17,184
No, thank you.

1017
00:52:17,259 --> 00:52:18,420
Goodbye...

1018
00:52:18,494 --> 00:52:21,463
and thank you
so much, Harry.

1019
00:52:23,131 --> 00:52:25,099
Goodbye.

1020
00:52:29,204 --> 00:52:31,172
Oh.

1021
00:52:39,548 --> 00:52:41,744
It's for you.

1022
00:52:45,254 --> 00:52:48,019
Thanks.

1023
00:53:02,639 --> 00:53:04,800
Excuse me.

1024
00:53:06,174 --> 00:53:08,507
I'm just gonna go and pack.

1025
00:53:08,578 --> 00:53:10,512
No, you are gonna stay

1026
00:53:10,580 --> 00:53:12,707
for the reading
of the will, aren't you?

1027
00:53:12,782 --> 00:53:15,774
Oh, no no no no.

1028
00:53:15,852 --> 00:53:18,582
Stay? Daddy didn't
leave her nothing.

1029
00:53:18,655 --> 00:53:20,919
- Vera.
- You should stay.

1030
00:53:20,990 --> 00:53:22,924
- No, really.
- Come on.

1031
00:53:22,992 --> 00:53:24,857
Come on, sit down.

1032
00:53:24,928 --> 00:53:27,294
- Come on over here.
- He your daddy too.

1033
00:53:27,363 --> 00:53:30,264
Brenda, come on.

1034
00:53:30,333 --> 00:53:31,960
Come on.
Come on in here now.

1035
00:53:32,035 --> 00:53:33,900
Come on, you'll probably
thank me too.

1036
00:53:33,970 --> 00:53:35,665
You're Daddy's child,
you may as well.

1037
00:53:35,738 --> 00:53:37,399
- You never know.
- Why don't you shut...

1038
00:53:37,473 --> 00:53:38,906
Sit down now, sit sit.

1039
00:53:38,975 --> 00:53:40,306
L.B., she ain't no puppy.

1040
00:53:40,376 --> 00:53:42,310
What, you gonna have
her sit and do tricks?

1041
00:53:42,378 --> 00:53:44,903
Brother Sam, you read
the last will and "testicles."

1042
00:53:44,981 --> 00:53:47,814
Yeah, that's what
I've been waiting for.

1043
00:53:47,884 --> 00:53:49,910
I got dressed up
for this. Come on.

1044
00:53:49,987 --> 00:53:51,544
Okay, folks...

1045
00:53:51,621 --> 00:53:54,385
Pop Brown's last
will and testament.

1046
00:53:54,457 --> 00:53:56,550
Here it is.

1047
00:53:56,626 --> 00:54:00,323
"To L.B. and his
beautiful wife Sarah..."

1048
00:54:00,396 --> 00:54:03,388
Beautiful? Must have been blind,
crippled and crazy.

1049
00:54:05,368 --> 00:54:07,428
"...I leave all my money..."

1050
00:54:07,504 --> 00:54:10,029
- Whoo! Thank you, Daddy.
- Sweet!

1051
00:54:10,107 --> 00:54:14,840
- "...a total amount of $575."
- You rich! You rich!

1052
00:54:14,912 --> 00:54:17,505
- That ain't nothing.
- What? 500?

1053
00:54:17,580 --> 00:54:20,310
We... we took care
of that sucker till he died.

1054
00:54:20,383 --> 00:54:22,579
He just leave us
nothing but that?

1055
00:54:22,653 --> 00:54:25,486
$575.

1056
00:54:25,556 --> 00:54:28,525
I washed his toes
and cleaned his nose!

1057
00:54:28,592 --> 00:54:31,186
He's so happy he can't
get his words out. He's rich.

1058
00:54:31,261 --> 00:54:32,819
And and and...
keep reading, baby.

1059
00:54:32,896 --> 00:54:35,364
- "To Vera..."
- Yes.

1060
00:54:35,432 --> 00:54:38,367
"...I leave all my love."

1061
00:54:38,435 --> 00:54:39,800
Love, yes, and...

1062
00:54:39,870 --> 00:54:42,065
"May it keep you warm at night."

1063
00:54:43,707 --> 00:54:45,641
There's got to be more.
You keep reading, baby.

1064
00:54:45,709 --> 00:54:47,700
Keep reading 'cause I know
there's more for me.

1065
00:54:47,778 --> 00:54:49,643
"And to Brown..."

1066
00:54:49,713 --> 00:54:51,773
Oh, boy, this is good.

1067
00:54:51,850 --> 00:54:53,976
"...I leave my house."

1068
00:54:54,051 --> 00:54:55,848
The house?

1069
00:54:55,919 --> 00:54:59,377
I'd rather have the love.
That house is tore up, Brown.

1070
00:54:59,456 --> 00:55:01,515
Shut up, Vera.
We grew up in that house.

1071
00:55:01,592 --> 00:55:04,459
Yeah, us and several families

1072
00:55:04,528 --> 00:55:07,190
of rats and roaches.
What the hell is that?

1073
00:55:07,264 --> 00:55:09,631
"To my daughter Brenda..."

1074
00:55:09,701 --> 00:55:11,395
- Brenda?
- Brenda?

1075
00:55:11,468 --> 00:55:15,269
- Wh...
- "...I leave my old rental property."

1076
00:55:15,340 --> 00:55:18,832
Oh, Brenda,
that's wonderful.

1077
00:55:18,910 --> 00:55:21,208
He left me a house?

1078
00:55:52,377 --> 00:55:55,210
Do you think we're living here?

1079
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:57,578
Do you think
we're living here now?

1080
00:55:57,649 --> 00:56:01,312
Okay, well, it has potential.

1081
00:56:01,386 --> 00:56:04,446
Potential to be torn down.

1082
00:56:04,522 --> 00:56:06,252
Is this our house, Mama?

1083
00:56:06,324 --> 00:56:08,258
Looks that way, baby.

1084
00:56:08,327 --> 00:56:10,851
- I'm gonna go back to the projects.
- Yeah, me too.

1085
00:56:10,929 --> 00:56:12,487
Me three.

1086
00:56:14,467 --> 00:56:16,764
I'd stay with you, brother.

1087
00:56:21,539 --> 00:56:23,508
Hmm.

1088
00:56:31,951 --> 00:56:34,044
Come on.

1089
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:36,087
At least go inside.

1090
00:56:37,423 --> 00:56:39,083
All right, but, Tosha, Lena,

1091
00:56:39,157 --> 00:56:41,558
y'all wait in the car.
Come on, go ahead.

1092
00:56:41,627 --> 00:56:43,595
Looks dangerous in here.

1093
00:56:47,066 --> 00:56:48,727
Ma.

1094
00:56:50,668 --> 00:56:52,637
It got a welcome mat.

1095
00:56:59,479 --> 00:57:01,446
Ooh.

1096
00:57:05,818 --> 00:57:08,446
- It's a nice house.
- Really?

1097
00:57:08,521 --> 00:57:10,854
What you looking at?

1098
00:57:12,858 --> 00:57:14,792
It just needs a little work.

1099
00:57:14,860 --> 00:57:17,351
This house don't need
no little nothing.

1100
00:57:17,429 --> 00:57:19,523
- Ma, come on.
- What?

1101
00:57:19,599 --> 00:57:21,532
Can we please get out of here?

1102
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:23,192
I'm not trying to miss the bus.

1103
00:57:23,269 --> 00:57:26,466
Could you just give me a minute?
Let me ask you something.

1104
00:57:26,539 --> 00:57:29,440
What do you think about
Harry coaching you?

1105
00:57:29,508 --> 00:57:32,739
- Hmm?
- I'm cool with it if it gets us out of here.

1106
00:57:34,381 --> 00:57:37,179
Oh, he cool with it.

1107
00:57:37,250 --> 00:57:38,682
That's good.

1108
00:57:38,751 --> 00:57:41,379
Uh-huh.

1109
00:57:41,453 --> 00:57:44,718
You know, I really wish
you weren't leaving.

1110
00:57:44,791 --> 00:57:48,249
Well, gotta get back to my life.

1111
00:57:48,328 --> 00:57:51,195
- Ma, come on!
- I'm coming.

1112
00:57:56,536 --> 00:57:58,504
Brenda, you leaving
me so soon?

1113
00:57:58,572 --> 00:58:00,836
Yeah, we got to be heading back.

1114
00:58:00,907 --> 00:58:02,807
Okay, well, look,
here's my number.

1115
00:58:02,876 --> 00:58:04,604
I want you to keep in touch, okay?

1116
00:58:04,678 --> 00:58:07,545
- Oh, I will.
- All right.

1117
00:58:07,614 --> 00:58:09,172
And here...

1118
00:58:09,249 --> 00:58:11,649
What's this?

1119
00:58:11,718 --> 00:58:14,551
It's from me and Sarah.
We wanted to bless you with something.

1120
00:58:14,621 --> 00:58:16,782
No, Cora, no. No, I can't.

1121
00:58:16,856 --> 00:58:19,121
- No, take it.
- I can't.

1122
00:58:19,193 --> 00:58:21,626
You have to take it.
We wanted to bless you with it.

1123
00:58:21,696 --> 00:58:23,720
It's just a little something.
Brenda, please.

1124
00:58:23,797 --> 00:58:26,027
Ain't no telling when
I'd be able to pay y'all back.

1125
00:58:26,099 --> 00:58:28,091
Oh, honey,
don't worry about that.

1126
00:58:28,169 --> 00:58:30,467
If some of these fathers
don't take care of these babies,

1127
00:58:30,538 --> 00:58:33,473
then us single mothers have
to stick together. Please take it.

1128
00:58:35,775 --> 00:58:38,836
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1129
00:58:38,913 --> 00:58:41,905
This is the nicest thing
that anybody's ever done for me.

1130
00:58:41,983 --> 00:58:44,007
- Really?
- Yeah.

1131
00:58:44,084 --> 00:58:46,245
Well, maybe you need
to change your friends.

1132
00:58:48,656 --> 00:58:52,113
- Thank you, thank you.
- Oh, you're so welcome.

1133
00:59:01,469 --> 00:59:04,062
- What did he say?
- Yeah, he hiring all right,

1134
00:59:04,137 --> 00:59:06,072
but not for the job
he advertising for.

1135
00:59:06,140 --> 00:59:08,540
- I go kill him now.
- No no no no.

1136
00:59:08,609 --> 00:59:10,736
- Cheryl.
- Let me go.

1137
00:59:10,811 --> 00:59:13,439
Stop it, calm down.

1138
00:59:13,514 --> 00:59:17,348
Hey, don't you wanna
hear about my trip, huh?

1139
00:59:17,418 --> 00:59:20,353
- You never told me about the trip.
- Don't ask.

1140
00:59:20,421 --> 00:59:22,912
- Brenda, you just...
- I'm just kidding.

1141
00:59:22,990 --> 00:59:25,049
Did he leave you
anything at least?

1142
00:59:25,126 --> 00:59:27,594
Yeah, a house.

1143
00:59:27,662 --> 00:59:30,154
- When are we moving?
- Huh-uh, girl, it's so raggedy.

1144
00:59:30,232 --> 00:59:32,928
You can't live in it.
Compared to that, we live in a palace.

1145
00:59:33,001 --> 00:59:34,592
Brenda, don't be selfish.

1146
00:59:34,669 --> 00:59:36,694
Let's move to Georgia
so I can find me one

1147
00:59:36,771 --> 00:59:39,865
of those big old
Jethro-looking papis

1148
00:59:39,940 --> 00:59:42,932
so I can cucuchanga.

1149
00:59:43,010 --> 00:59:45,945
Girl, you know what?
I think I might have met somebody

1150
00:59:46,013 --> 00:59:47,948
- who'd be just your style.
- For me?

1151
00:59:48,016 --> 00:59:49,243
Uh-huh.

1152
00:59:49,317 --> 00:59:51,285
His name's Brown.

1153
00:59:53,388 --> 00:59:57,016
I got it.

1154
00:59:57,091 --> 00:59:59,924
Who is it?

1155
00:59:59,994 --> 01:00:02,020
Hey.

1156
01:00:02,097 --> 01:00:03,894
Hey.

1157
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:07,625
What you doing here?

1158
01:00:07,703 --> 01:00:09,637
I've been thinking
about what you said,

1159
01:00:09,705 --> 01:00:11,865
and I'm gonna help you out.

1160
01:00:11,939 --> 01:00:15,033
So can I come in,

1161
01:00:15,109 --> 01:00:17,044
please?

1162
01:00:20,282 --> 01:00:23,046
Yeah.

1163
01:00:23,118 --> 01:00:25,086
Come on in.

1164
01:00:37,265 --> 01:00:40,234
Damn, girl, this how you live?

1165
01:00:41,737 --> 01:00:44,002
You gonna give me
some money or not?

1166
01:00:44,073 --> 01:00:46,803
What you gonna give me, huh?

1167
01:00:46,876 --> 01:00:49,902
I ain't gonna
give you nothing.

1168
01:00:49,979 --> 01:00:53,470
- Aw, come on, girl, damn it.
- No, stop it, stop it.

1169
01:00:53,548 --> 01:00:56,108
You oughta wanna do the right thing
and take care of your son.

1170
01:00:56,184 --> 01:00:57,880
- You're right.
- Why I gotta threaten you

1171
01:00:57,954 --> 01:00:59,716
with child support
to take care of him?

1172
01:00:59,788 --> 01:01:01,381
Damn, Brenda, do it.

1173
01:01:01,457 --> 01:01:05,017
- The boy probably ain't mine anyway.
- You bastard!

1174
01:01:05,093 --> 01:01:06,618
You need this money,
don't you, right?

1175
01:01:06,696 --> 01:01:08,322
So come on, baby,
where's the bedroom?

1176
01:01:08,397 --> 01:01:11,230
No, stop it. I don't sleep
with men for money.

1177
01:01:11,299 --> 01:01:14,598
Well, your mama used to,
didn't she?

1178
01:01:14,669 --> 01:01:17,604
I ain't my mama. Get the hell
out of my house!

1179
01:01:20,676 --> 01:01:23,907
Forget you then.
You all ain't getting nothing.

1180
01:01:23,980 --> 01:01:26,312
I don't care if both of y'all
starve to death.

1181
01:01:26,382 --> 01:01:29,681
You bastard. You would
do that to your own son?

1182
01:01:29,752 --> 01:01:31,719
- Hey.
- You're just evil.

1183
01:01:31,787 --> 01:01:35,246
I told you when you was pregnant I
didn't give a damn about you or the boy.

1184
01:01:35,324 --> 01:01:38,760
Matter of fact, what did you do with
the $200 I gave you for the abortion?

1185
01:01:38,828 --> 01:01:40,921
I'll bet you wish
you had that $200 now.

1186
01:01:40,997 --> 01:01:43,465
- Don't you?
- Hey, Michael, baby.

1187
01:01:44,867 --> 01:01:47,427
Hey, Mike. What's up, boy?

1188
01:01:50,173 --> 01:01:52,437
Mama, why you begging like this?

1189
01:01:52,508 --> 01:01:54,739
No no, he ain't gotta help us.

1190
01:01:54,812 --> 01:01:56,904
No, I know how to make some things
happen on my own.

1191
01:01:56,979 --> 01:01:58,810
You don't need
to beg this motherf...

1192
01:01:58,881 --> 01:02:01,077
Leave it.
He's still your father.

1193
01:02:01,151 --> 01:02:04,119
- Get your hand out of my face.
- Boy, better watch your mouth!

1194
01:02:04,187 --> 01:02:07,122
- No, no, it's not worth it.
- Mama, are you defending him?

1195
01:02:07,190 --> 01:02:09,751
Look, if you ain't
man enough to help us,

1196
01:02:09,827 --> 01:02:12,887
I know how to make some things
happen on my own.

1197
01:02:12,963 --> 01:02:15,431
- No, baby. Where are you going?
- No no.

1198
01:02:15,499 --> 01:02:17,467
Michael! Mike, stop him.

1199
01:02:17,534 --> 01:02:20,128
That boy ain't my responsibility.
It isn't my problem.

1200
01:02:23,006 --> 01:02:26,533
No, Michael!

1201
01:02:26,610 --> 01:02:28,474
Michael!

1202
01:02:54,872 --> 01:02:56,305
Michael.

1203
01:02:56,373 --> 01:02:58,170
- Hey.
- Hey.

1204
01:02:58,242 --> 01:03:01,075
Can I come in?

1205
01:03:01,144 --> 01:03:03,204
Yeah yeah, come on in.

1206
01:03:10,587 --> 01:03:12,555
Have a seat.

1207
01:03:14,859 --> 01:03:17,760
I'm sorry. I thought
you were Michael.

1208
01:03:17,829 --> 01:03:20,730
He's not here?

1209
01:03:20,798 --> 01:03:22,287
No.

1210
01:03:22,366 --> 01:03:25,427
Did you tell him about the practice
sessions I set up for him?

1211
01:03:25,503 --> 01:03:27,629
Yeah, I did.

1212
01:03:27,704 --> 01:03:29,696
I'm sorry.

1213
01:03:31,576 --> 01:03:33,566
What's going on?

1214
01:03:44,988 --> 01:03:46,650
What's up, man?

1215
01:03:46,724 --> 01:03:49,215
What's up? You're just
the man I need to see.

1216
01:03:49,294 --> 01:03:50,726
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

1217
01:03:50,794 --> 01:03:53,821
You can't win a game
with your shoes falling off, dawg.

1218
01:03:53,898 --> 01:03:56,662
- Here.
- These are for me?

1219
01:03:56,734 --> 01:03:58,998
You know it. I got money
on this game, dawg.

1220
01:03:59,070 --> 01:04:00,731
I need you on your "A."

1221
01:04:02,473 --> 01:04:05,840
- Thanks, Calvin.
- It's all good, dawg.

1222
01:04:05,910 --> 01:04:08,344
Hey, man,

1223
01:04:08,413 --> 01:04:09,903
you hanging tonight?

1224
01:04:09,981 --> 01:04:12,211
Yeah.

1225
01:04:12,283 --> 01:04:15,218
You working?

1226
01:04:15,286 --> 01:04:16,584
Yeah.

1227
01:04:16,655 --> 01:04:18,713
You want in?

1228
01:04:20,592 --> 01:04:24,358
Yeah, show me
what I gotta do.

1229
01:04:24,429 --> 01:04:27,694
- All right.
- Mike.

1230
01:04:27,765 --> 01:04:30,735
Who is this fool?

1231
01:04:30,803 --> 01:04:33,270
- He 5-0?
- No, man, I'll handle it.

1232
01:04:37,476 --> 01:04:39,410
Dude, what are you doing here?

1233
01:04:39,478 --> 01:04:40,910
Your mother's looking for you.

1234
01:04:40,979 --> 01:04:43,210
You got some nerve
coming around here.

1235
01:04:43,282 --> 01:04:45,580
- So you gonna do this, huh?
- Why not?

1236
01:04:45,651 --> 01:04:48,916
- You're too smart for this.
- Dude, you don't know nothing about me.

1237
01:04:48,988 --> 01:04:52,151
I know you're about
to make a stupid mistake.

1238
01:04:52,224 --> 01:04:54,283
Harry, you don't know
nothing about my life.

1239
01:04:54,360 --> 01:04:56,658
You don't know
what we're up against.

1240
01:04:56,729 --> 01:04:58,821
It doesn't matter
what you're up against.

1241
01:04:58,896 --> 01:05:02,333
You could make a stupid mistake and have
everything in the world going for you.

1242
01:05:05,371 --> 01:05:08,033
I was in the league.

1243
01:05:08,107 --> 01:05:09,665
I started gambling.

1244
01:05:09,742 --> 01:05:13,304
Lost everything,
including my wife and kids.

1245
01:05:15,414 --> 01:05:19,078
I made mistakes
I'm still paying for today.

1246
01:05:19,152 --> 01:05:21,312
I know a few things about
going down the wrong road.

1247
01:05:21,387 --> 01:05:24,687
And this is the wrong road.

1248
01:05:25,758 --> 01:05:27,989
- All right, man.
- Dude,

1249
01:05:28,061 --> 01:05:29,789
you better get out of here.

1250
01:05:29,862 --> 01:05:32,831
Okay.

1251
01:05:32,898 --> 01:05:34,957
We're supposed to practice
tomorrow at 3:00.

1252
01:05:36,670 --> 01:05:39,468
If you show up,

1253
01:05:39,539 --> 01:05:42,099
then I'll know you're as smart
as I think you are.

1254
01:05:44,176 --> 01:05:46,041
Yeah, whatever, man.

1255
01:05:46,111 --> 01:05:47,977
I'm gonna be here for two days.

1256
01:05:51,751 --> 01:05:55,208
- All right?
- Yeah, let's do this.

1257
01:06:09,702 --> 01:06:11,671
Come here.

1258
01:06:21,715 --> 01:06:24,081
What?

1259
01:06:24,150 --> 01:06:26,744
Where you been all night, huh?

1260
01:06:28,621 --> 01:06:30,021
I was with Calvin.

1261
01:06:30,091 --> 01:06:32,422
Okay, so you're a man now.

1262
01:06:32,492 --> 01:06:34,392
You gonna sell dope, huh?

1263
01:06:34,461 --> 01:06:36,258
Now you think
that makes you a man?

1264
01:06:36,329 --> 01:06:38,855
Why not, Mama?
We ain't got nothing.

1265
01:06:38,933 --> 01:06:41,299
- Boy, are you crazy?
- No, you work like a dog,

1266
01:06:41,368 --> 01:06:42,766
and what has it gotten you?

1267
01:06:42,836 --> 01:06:44,771
You talk about God
making a way.

1268
01:06:44,839 --> 01:06:46,829
Mama, I'm not trying
to die to get to heaven.

1269
01:06:46,907 --> 01:06:48,430
I want mine here on earth.

1270
01:06:48,508 --> 01:06:50,409
Then you know what?

1271
01:06:50,478 --> 01:06:52,878
You gonna have to get out
of my house then, huh?

1272
01:06:52,947 --> 01:06:55,541
You think you're grown? Go.

1273
01:06:55,616 --> 01:06:57,014
Get out!

1274
01:06:57,083 --> 01:06:59,018
Mama, where am I gonna go?

1275
01:06:59,086 --> 01:07:01,646
I don't wanna hear it.
I done my best by you.

1276
01:07:01,722 --> 01:07:04,247
I done tried. Get out.

1277
01:07:04,325 --> 01:07:06,554
Who's gonna help you
with Lena and Tosha?

1278
01:07:06,626 --> 01:07:08,787
Don't you even worry
about that, okay? I got that.

1279
01:07:08,862 --> 01:07:10,694
You just get out.

1280
01:07:10,765 --> 01:07:13,165
- No no, I'm not going, Mama.
- Go on.

1281
01:07:13,234 --> 01:07:16,169
No child of mine is gonna
sell dope, you hear me?

1282
01:07:16,237 --> 01:07:19,968
I ain't sitting up in here waiting
to hear that you done got killed.

1283
01:07:20,040 --> 01:07:21,871
Get out. Hit the bricks.

1284
01:07:21,942 --> 01:07:23,533
No, Mama, I'm not going.

1285
01:07:23,610 --> 01:07:26,205
No, if I go, I'm a coward
just like my dad.

1286
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:27,770
I'm your son.

1287
01:07:27,848 --> 01:07:30,476
I'm not gonna leave you
like them other dudes.

1288
01:07:30,551 --> 01:07:32,485
Mama, I'm just tired

1289
01:07:32,553 --> 01:07:34,646
of seeing you hurt
and struggling.

1290
01:07:34,722 --> 01:07:36,246
I'm sorry.

1291
01:07:36,323 --> 01:07:39,087
Mama, I'm sorry.

1292
01:07:40,796 --> 01:07:44,287
- I'm sorry.
- We gonna be all right.

1293
01:07:44,365 --> 01:07:45,957
You hear me?

1294
01:07:46,033 --> 01:07:49,093
- I'm sorry.
- We gonna be all right.

1295
01:07:49,170 --> 01:07:52,937
We gonna be all right.
I promise. I promise.

1296
01:07:53,008 --> 01:07:56,238
I'm sorry, Mama.

1297
01:07:56,310 --> 01:07:58,802
I love you, baby.
I love you.

1298
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:02,007
- I love you too. I'm sorry.
- All right, all right, all right.

1299
01:08:02,082 --> 01:08:04,210
Okay, just...

1300
01:08:04,286 --> 01:08:06,516
just... just go to bed, all right?

1301
01:08:06,588 --> 01:08:09,819
Go now.

1302
01:08:24,339 --> 01:08:26,637
All right, let's go.
On the whistle, chest passes.

1303
01:08:26,708 --> 01:08:28,335
Passer makes the shooter.

1304
01:08:28,410 --> 01:08:31,810
Pass it like you want him
to shoot the ball.

1305
01:08:33,048 --> 01:08:35,516
Are you coachable?
Do you listen?

1306
01:08:37,552 --> 01:08:39,486
It's good to see you.

1307
01:08:41,289 --> 01:08:44,588
On the whistle,
chest passes.

1308
01:08:56,771 --> 01:08:59,239
- What's up, Calvin?
- What's up, dawg?

1309
01:08:59,307 --> 01:09:01,332
I won six large
on you tonight.

1310
01:09:01,409 --> 01:09:03,469
You play with heart, son.

1311
01:09:04,980 --> 01:09:07,744
Here.

1312
01:09:09,418 --> 01:09:12,148
Look, man, that's what
I came to tell you.

1313
01:09:12,221 --> 01:09:14,553
Calvin, I can't do this.

1314
01:09:16,892 --> 01:09:20,020
Here, this is all the money.

1315
01:09:20,095 --> 01:09:22,859
It's your cut and mine.

1316
01:09:22,931 --> 01:09:25,695
I'm sorry, dude.

1317
01:09:25,767 --> 01:09:29,067
You know what?
I understand that.

1318
01:09:29,138 --> 01:09:30,900
You ain't got this
in you, man.

1319
01:09:30,972 --> 01:09:34,500
You go on now.
You go play basketball.

1320
01:09:34,577 --> 01:09:37,569
Me? I'm gonna be
a hood rat.

1321
01:09:37,647 --> 01:09:39,171
That's all I'll ever be.

1322
01:09:39,248 --> 01:09:41,239
Calvin, you can be
whatever you want to be.

1323
01:09:41,317 --> 01:09:44,548
No, kid.

1324
01:09:47,757 --> 01:09:51,249
Yo, son, you think
you can just sell on my turf?

1325
01:09:52,528 --> 01:09:54,758
Mike, run!

1326
01:10:07,710 --> 01:10:10,679
Mike's great. I wish he
was playing in my gym.

1327
01:10:10,746 --> 01:10:13,738
What about you?
What about your house?

1328
01:10:13,816 --> 01:10:15,249
What about it?

1329
01:10:15,318 --> 01:10:17,879
What you gonna do with it?

1330
01:10:17,955 --> 01:10:20,753
Let it do what it's been doing
for the last whatever years.

1331
01:10:20,824 --> 01:10:22,587
Which is what?

1332
01:10:22,659 --> 01:10:24,956
Sit there.

1333
01:10:25,027 --> 01:10:28,589
- That ain't no good.
- Try this. You'll like it.

1334
01:10:28,665 --> 01:10:30,655
Get in there. Come on.

1335
01:10:32,169 --> 01:10:34,399
Oh, man, that's good.
What is that?

1336
01:10:34,471 --> 01:10:36,631
- Is that pork?
- That's pork, baby.

1337
01:10:36,706 --> 01:10:39,436
I don't even eat pork,
and that's good.

1338
01:10:57,761 --> 01:10:59,524
Brenda, I like talking to you.

1339
01:10:59,596 --> 01:11:01,325
Thanks.

1340
01:11:01,398 --> 01:11:04,663
But this is about
helping my son, right?

1341
01:11:04,735 --> 01:11:06,293
Yeah.

1342
01:11:06,370 --> 01:11:09,362
What if I also enjoy spending
as much time with you

1343
01:11:09,439 --> 01:11:11,498
- as I do coaching your son?
- Harry.

1344
01:11:12,909 --> 01:11:15,173
I ain't going down
that road, okay?

1345
01:11:17,381 --> 01:11:19,373
- Thanks, girl.
- You're welcome.

1346
01:11:19,450 --> 01:11:22,283
- All right now, I work for tips.
- I know.

1347
01:11:22,353 --> 01:11:24,650
- This is your neighborhood, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

1348
01:11:24,721 --> 01:11:26,211
It ain't so bad, is it?

1349
01:11:26,289 --> 01:11:29,622
You'd rather live here
than in your own house?

1350
01:11:29,693 --> 01:11:32,821
Well, I know this. I don't know
nothing about Georgia.

1351
01:11:32,896 --> 01:11:34,797
So it's friends
keeping you here.

1352
01:11:34,866 --> 01:11:38,631
If I could live here,
I ain't afraid of nothing.

1353
01:11:39,737 --> 01:11:41,863
Brenda, aye, mami.

1354
01:11:41,938 --> 01:11:44,532
- Cheryl, hi, girl.
- I've been looking all over for you.

1355
01:11:44,608 --> 01:11:46,201
We have to go to the hospital.

1356
01:11:46,277 --> 01:11:48,802
- The hospital, why?
- They shot him.

1357
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:51,280
- What happened, Cheryl?
- Mikey... they shot him!

1358
01:11:51,349 --> 01:11:52,975
Michael.

1359
01:12:01,993 --> 01:12:03,927
I never had much of a mother,

1360
01:12:03,995 --> 01:12:07,726
so I was determined
to be the best that I could.

1361
01:12:07,799 --> 01:12:10,461
When he was young,
I gave him to the Lord.

1362
01:12:10,535 --> 01:12:12,935
I said, "Lord, protect my baby.

1363
01:12:13,004 --> 01:12:14,938
Watch him for me."

1364
01:12:15,006 --> 01:12:16,940
But I can't...

1365
01:12:17,008 --> 01:12:18,908
I can't feed him.

1366
01:12:18,977 --> 01:12:20,944
I can't give him what he need.

1367
01:12:23,014 --> 01:12:24,949
There are nights
when I go to bed hungry

1368
01:12:25,017 --> 01:12:28,452
'cause I know they didn't
get enough to eat all day.

1369
01:12:32,457 --> 01:12:34,687
You know, I just...

1370
01:12:34,759 --> 01:12:36,887
feel so bad.

1371
01:12:39,932 --> 01:12:42,628
Why did I do this to them?

1372
01:12:42,701 --> 01:12:46,397
You know, I can't even
keep 'em out of harm's way.

1373
01:12:46,471 --> 01:12:48,372
Hey hey hey hey.

1374
01:12:48,440 --> 01:12:50,499
You've done more than most.

1375
01:12:53,345 --> 01:12:56,542
Look, thank you.
I know you have to go.

1376
01:12:56,615 --> 01:12:58,081
No, I'm not going anywhere

1377
01:12:58,149 --> 01:13:00,674
unless you want me to go.

1378
01:13:00,751 --> 01:13:02,777
No.

1379
01:13:02,855 --> 01:13:05,415
I'm here with you.

1380
01:13:06,824 --> 01:13:09,759
Thank you.

1381
01:13:13,966 --> 01:13:17,732
Hey, Brenda, what's up with all these
emergency phone calls?

1382
01:13:17,803 --> 01:13:19,771
Michael Jr.,
he was shot last night

1383
01:13:19,838 --> 01:13:21,772
trying to hustle money for me.

1384
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:23,899
But I ain't paying for no funeral.

1385
01:13:23,976 --> 01:13:26,638
He ain't dead. You bastard.

1386
01:13:26,712 --> 01:13:28,805
Hold on here. Don't call me.

1387
01:13:28,881 --> 01:13:31,179
- You know what happened last night.
- Hey hey!

1388
01:13:31,250 --> 01:13:33,275
- Is everything all right here, Brenda?
- Yeah.

1389
01:13:33,352 --> 01:13:36,117
I'm fine.

1390
01:13:38,958 --> 01:13:41,950
I gotta go to work.

1391
01:13:42,028 --> 01:13:44,758
Hey hey.

1392
01:13:44,831 --> 01:13:46,297
- Michael.
- What?

1393
01:13:48,133 --> 01:13:51,193
This is my last $25.

1394
01:13:51,270 --> 01:13:54,171
That's what you make?
Can I buy an hour of your time

1395
01:13:54,239 --> 01:13:55,798
to spend with your son?

1396
01:13:58,611 --> 01:14:00,544
Don't you call my house again.

1397
01:14:00,612 --> 01:14:03,672
You're pissing off my wife.

1398
01:14:09,421 --> 01:14:12,789
- You okay?
- Miss Brown.

1399
01:14:12,859 --> 01:14:15,156
- Yes.
- Hi. Now we managed

1400
01:14:15,227 --> 01:14:17,389
to get the bullet
and stop the bleeding.

1401
01:14:17,463 --> 01:14:19,624
It's a miracle that
it missed his vital organs.

1402
01:14:19,699 --> 01:14:21,462
Is he gonna be okay?

1403
01:14:21,534 --> 01:14:23,467
Yes, he's gonna be fine.

1404
01:14:23,535 --> 01:14:24,867
I need to see him.

1405
01:14:24,938 --> 01:14:26,495
Well, he's in recovery right now,

1406
01:14:26,572 --> 01:14:29,041
but he'll be in I.C.U.
in just a little bit.

1407
01:14:29,108 --> 01:14:31,303
Thank you, thank you.

1408
01:14:31,377 --> 01:14:34,210
You're welcome.
You're welcome. All right.

1409
01:14:58,672 --> 01:15:01,835
# This life can make me
so confused #

1410
01:15:01,908 --> 01:15:04,275
# But it's all right #

1411
01:15:04,345 --> 01:15:06,870
# Living day by day,
I feel so used #

1412
01:15:06,947 --> 01:15:09,882
# That ain't right #

1413
01:15:09,950 --> 01:15:12,544
# I just want to run and hide #

1414
01:15:12,620 --> 01:15:14,644
# But I don't have
the time to cry #

1415
01:15:14,721 --> 01:15:16,916
# It's all right #

1416
01:15:16,990 --> 01:15:19,551
# It's all right, all right #

1417
01:15:21,128 --> 01:15:24,063
# Many thoughts are
runnin' through my head #

1418
01:15:24,131 --> 01:15:26,292
# It's all right #

1419
01:15:26,367 --> 01:15:29,028
# Wishing to be
somewhere else but here #

1420
01:15:29,103 --> 01:15:30,934
# And it's all right #

1421
01:15:32,239 --> 01:15:34,468
# I can't wait
to see your face #

1422
01:15:34,540 --> 01:15:36,702
# I need a smile
and your embrace #

1423
01:15:36,777 --> 01:15:39,007
# I'm all right #

1424
01:15:39,079 --> 01:15:42,480
# I'm all right, yeah #

1425
01:15:42,549 --> 01:15:45,609
# Life can bring us
through any changes #

1426
01:15:45,686 --> 01:15:47,381
# It's all right #

1427
01:15:47,454 --> 01:15:49,445
- # Never give up #
- # Just don't give up #

1428
01:15:49,523 --> 01:15:52,356
# Know that it's
gonna be all right #

1429
01:15:54,028 --> 01:15:56,519
- # People come and they go #
- # They go #

1430
01:15:56,597 --> 01:15:59,566
# It's just the way that it goes #

1431
01:15:59,633 --> 01:16:01,328
# Everything is everything #

1432
01:16:02,369 --> 01:16:04,701
# It's all right #

1433
01:16:04,772 --> 01:16:06,206
# Sometime the rain #

1434
01:16:06,274 --> 01:16:08,970
# It makes me sad
and it's all right #

1435
01:16:10,511 --> 01:16:13,036
# Some things in the world
they make me mad #

1436
01:16:13,113 --> 01:16:15,605
# And it's all right #

1437
01:16:15,684 --> 01:16:18,482
# In the morning
when I see the sun #

1438
01:16:18,553 --> 01:16:20,544
# I know I'm not the only one #

1439
01:16:20,622 --> 01:16:23,352
# And it's all right #

1440
01:16:23,425 --> 01:16:25,585
# It's all right... #

1441
01:16:25,659 --> 01:16:27,684
I can't believe you're leaving.

1442
01:16:27,761 --> 01:16:29,559
I know, but you're
welcome to come.

1443
01:16:29,631 --> 01:16:31,291
I don't think so.

1444
01:16:31,365 --> 01:16:33,697
I'll come visit
or something, but no.

1445
01:16:33,767 --> 01:16:36,430
And anyways, look at that.

1446
01:16:36,504 --> 01:16:38,096
You're in very good hands.

1447
01:16:38,173 --> 01:16:40,300
I know, I can't even believe
he stayed as long as he did.

1448
01:16:40,375 --> 01:16:43,674
Ay, you know I don't like half
the men you've dated,

1449
01:16:43,745 --> 01:16:46,407
but this one...

1450
01:16:46,481 --> 01:16:47,948
I like him a lot.

1451
01:16:48,016 --> 01:16:49,847
Mmm.

1452
01:16:49,918 --> 01:16:51,579
Uh, we ain't dating.

1453
01:16:51,653 --> 01:16:54,178
Yeah, call it whatever you want.
You might not be dating him,

1454
01:16:54,256 --> 01:16:57,588
- but he's definitely dating you.
- Huh-uh.

1455
01:16:57,659 --> 01:16:59,149
Come on.

1456
01:17:00,862 --> 01:17:03,330
Hey, beautiful,

1457
01:17:03,398 --> 01:17:04,865
you mess with my girl,

1458
01:17:04,933 --> 01:17:08,597
I come down there
and I get you...

1459
01:17:08,671 --> 01:17:10,331
- English, Cheryl, English.
- Mm-hmm.

1460
01:17:10,405 --> 01:17:12,566
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm!

1461
01:17:18,813 --> 01:17:21,441
What are you
doing with that bag?

1462
01:17:25,253 --> 01:17:27,448
# Everything is everything #

1463
01:17:30,058 --> 01:17:32,550
- # It's gonna be #
- # All right #

1464
01:17:33,061 --> 01:17:36,087
# Life can bring us
through many changes #

1465
01:17:36,164 --> 01:17:39,190
# It's all right... #

1466
01:17:45,541 --> 01:17:48,567
Are you serious?

1467
01:17:48,644 --> 01:17:50,373
Oh, Tosha.

1468
01:17:51,414 --> 01:17:53,472
Oh my God.

1469
01:17:53,548 --> 01:17:55,039
Welcome home.

1470
01:17:55,117 --> 01:17:57,017
What is this? Harry!

1471
01:18:01,257 --> 01:18:02,690
I can't believe this.

1472
01:18:02,758 --> 01:18:04,191
It's your house.

1473
01:18:04,260 --> 01:18:06,285
Oh my God.

1474
01:18:06,362 --> 01:18:09,456
Hey! Don't y'all just
stand there.

1475
01:18:09,532 --> 01:18:10,726
Come on in this house!

1476
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:13,234
Come on now!
Come on!

1477
01:18:13,302 --> 01:18:15,099
Oh, Harry told us
what happened.

1478
01:18:15,171 --> 01:18:17,298
- We all prayed for you, Mike.
- Thank you.

1479
01:18:17,373 --> 01:18:19,774
Y'all come on in.
I decorated.

1480
01:18:19,843 --> 01:18:21,810
- What?
- No he didn't.

1481
01:18:23,646 --> 01:18:25,239
Baby. Awww.

1482
01:18:25,315 --> 01:18:26,781
Come here.
Come on.

1483
01:18:37,227 --> 01:18:38,693
Oh my gosh.

1484
01:18:40,397 --> 01:18:42,297
Mom!

1485
01:18:42,365 --> 01:18:44,059
Mama, I got my own room!

1486
01:18:44,133 --> 01:18:45,965
I know, baby.

1487
01:18:47,036 --> 01:18:50,028
Oh! Oh, God,
thank you.

1488
01:18:50,105 --> 01:18:54,065
Thank you. How did you
afford to do all of this?

1489
01:18:54,144 --> 01:18:57,409
Well, I pitched in
most of the money.

1490
01:18:57,481 --> 01:18:59,972
If you call $45 most of it,

1491
01:19:00,050 --> 01:19:02,280
well then, okay.

1492
01:19:03,553 --> 01:19:05,680
No, we had a fundraiser
at the church.

1493
01:19:05,755 --> 01:19:08,019
- Yeah, and we all pitched in.
- Thank you. Thank you.

1494
01:19:08,091 --> 01:19:11,424
l... I don't know what to say.

1495
01:19:11,495 --> 01:19:13,326
Money shot.

1496
01:19:13,396 --> 01:19:16,126
Here you go. Go up strong.
Always go up strong.

1497
01:19:21,738 --> 01:19:25,196
You know, I think
that Harry's a nice man.

1498
01:19:25,275 --> 01:19:26,936
- Yes, he is.
- Mm-hmm.

1499
01:19:27,010 --> 01:19:30,469
- Thank you.
- He put up the most money for this house.

1500
01:19:30,548 --> 01:19:32,378
- He sure did.
- He did?

1501
01:19:32,449 --> 01:19:34,041
And I think he likes you.

1502
01:19:34,117 --> 01:19:36,712
Mm-hmm.

1503
01:19:36,787 --> 01:19:38,344
- Mama?
- Yeah, baby.

1504
01:19:38,421 --> 01:19:40,082
Where do these
two lovebirds go?

1505
01:19:40,156 --> 01:19:42,091
Come on, I'll show you.

1506
01:19:46,596 --> 01:19:48,497
I think...

1507
01:19:48,566 --> 01:19:50,625
he likes her son.

1508
01:19:50,701 --> 01:19:52,190
What are you talking about?

1509
01:19:52,269 --> 01:19:53,760
Honey, are you that naive?

1510
01:19:53,838 --> 01:19:56,204
You haven't noticed all that attention
he been giving that boy?

1511
01:19:56,274 --> 01:19:58,002
What are you trying to say, Vera?

1512
01:19:58,074 --> 01:20:00,339
Oh, not like that.

1513
01:20:00,411 --> 01:20:03,811
He's being so nice to her
because her son

1514
01:20:03,880 --> 01:20:05,314
is a gold mine.

1515
01:20:05,383 --> 01:20:07,283
Okay? He's trying to get in

1516
01:20:07,351 --> 01:20:10,115
so he can get that boy to go pro
so he can get some of them perks...

1517
01:20:11,422 --> 01:20:14,050
maybe pay off some of them
gambling debts, okay?

1518
01:20:14,125 --> 01:20:18,356
Child, please.
This is an investment.

1519
01:20:18,428 --> 01:20:20,158
She better watch out.

1520
01:20:20,231 --> 01:20:22,392
- I don't believe none of that.
- Me neither.

1521
01:20:22,466 --> 01:20:24,627
Why else would
a man be this nice

1522
01:20:24,702 --> 01:20:26,465
to a woman with three...

1523
01:20:26,537 --> 01:20:29,028
count 'em... three kids.

1524
01:20:29,106 --> 01:20:31,939
Well, you know, Vera, there are
some good men in this world.

1525
01:20:32,009 --> 01:20:34,068
And Harry happens
to be one of them.

1526
01:20:34,145 --> 01:20:37,239
- That's right.
- Not according to the local bookies.

1527
01:20:37,315 --> 01:20:39,545
Why you think he got
kicked out of the league?

1528
01:20:39,617 --> 01:20:42,677
Don't sit there acting like y'all don't
know this boy got a gambling problem.

1529
01:20:42,753 --> 01:20:45,347
- Don't be acting like you don't know.
- You need to stop

1530
01:20:45,423 --> 01:20:47,585
- listening to all that gossip, Vera.
- Please.

1531
01:20:47,659 --> 01:20:51,150
- Stop being messy.
- Hush your mouth before she hears you.

1532
01:20:51,228 --> 01:20:53,493
- Yes.
- If you ain't happy,

1533
01:20:53,565 --> 01:20:55,726
you don't want nobody else to be.

1534
01:20:55,801 --> 01:20:58,291
Well, I called it like
I see it and smell it!

1535
01:20:58,370 --> 01:21:01,099
Well, you're always
smelling up some mess.

1536
01:21:01,173 --> 01:21:02,764
That's right.

1537
01:21:02,840 --> 01:21:05,105
Do your negative
smelling somewhere else

1538
01:21:05,177 --> 01:21:07,077
'cause you're always
smelling up a mess.

1539
01:21:11,682 --> 01:21:13,173
- Cora!
- What?

1540
01:21:13,251 --> 01:21:14,979
- Cora!
- Yeah!

1541
01:21:15,052 --> 01:21:17,816
I'm in the kitchen!
I'm in the kitchen!

1542
01:21:17,888 --> 01:21:21,120
Your mama done went crazy!
People just everywhere!

1543
01:21:21,193 --> 01:21:23,683
Mr. Brown, please!

1544
01:21:23,761 --> 01:21:26,253
Cora, you slapped your daddy?
I oughta whup your butt.

1545
01:21:26,331 --> 01:21:27,855
Calm down. What's wrong?

1546
01:21:27,933 --> 01:21:29,365
Just sit down. Sit down.

1547
01:21:29,433 --> 01:21:30,765
- Turn the TV on.
- Okay...

1548
01:21:30,836 --> 01:21:32,599
- Turn the TV on!
- What happened on the TV?

1549
01:21:32,671 --> 01:21:34,639
- Get the TV on.
- I'm trying to get it on. Hold on.

1550
01:21:34,706 --> 01:21:36,674
- What happened?
- Look!

1551
01:21:36,742 --> 01:21:40,439
A routine traffic stop turned
into one of the largest and most bizarre

1552
01:21:40,512 --> 01:21:42,605
and shocking police pursuits

1553
01:21:42,681 --> 01:21:44,808
that we have ever seen.

1554
01:21:44,883 --> 01:21:47,750
This old woman is driving
like she has a lot to lose.

1555
01:21:47,819 --> 01:21:49,788
Who could this be calling
me right now? Hello.

1556
01:21:49,856 --> 01:21:52,654
Cora, hey.
How you doing, baby?

1557
01:21:52,725 --> 01:21:54,453
Madea, please tell me
that's not you.

1558
01:21:54,526 --> 01:21:55,959
Yeah, it's me, honey.

1559
01:21:56,028 --> 01:21:57,256
Yeah.

1560
01:21:57,329 --> 01:21:58,956
Madea, why don't you
just pull over?

1561
01:21:59,031 --> 01:22:00,589
- You can't out...
- I can't pull over.

1562
01:22:00,666 --> 01:22:02,634
- You goin' to jail.
- These police is after me.

1563
01:22:02,701 --> 01:22:04,135
Hold on, I'm gonna put you
on speakerphone.

1564
01:22:04,203 --> 01:22:05,931
Mabel, pull over. Just stop.

1565
01:22:06,004 --> 01:22:08,564
Oh, Lordy, there's helicopters
and everything now.

1566
01:22:08,640 --> 01:22:11,734
- Pull your car over...
- Mabel, you can't outrun

1567
01:22:11,810 --> 01:22:13,801
- the "helichoppers."
- Please, Madea, please!

1568
01:22:13,879 --> 01:22:16,643
- They ain't taking me to jail!
- Like hell they ain't.

1569
01:22:16,715 --> 01:22:18,877
...just gonna send me to jail.
I'm going all the way this time.

1570
01:22:18,951 --> 01:22:20,816
I'm going all the way this time.

1571
01:22:20,887 --> 01:22:22,717
Madea, please
pull the car over.

1572
01:22:22,788 --> 01:22:25,053
They ain't gonna get me!
They ain't gonna get me!

1573
01:22:25,124 --> 01:22:26,819
I'm gonna be on "Cops."

1574
01:22:26,893 --> 01:22:28,383
No, you can't. Madea, please.

1575
01:22:28,460 --> 01:22:30,326
I love you, honey.
Please just pull over.

1576
01:22:30,396 --> 01:22:31,988
I can't pull over, Cora.

1577
01:22:32,065 --> 01:22:34,555
Y'all come down there to DeKalb County,
put $20 on my book.

1578
01:22:34,633 --> 01:22:36,693
I'm running out of gas.
I might have to stop.

1579
01:22:36,769 --> 01:22:39,795
If it's any "constipation,"
I love you.

1580
01:22:39,872 --> 01:22:42,170
I always have
and I always will.

1581
01:22:42,241 --> 01:22:44,232
Madea, please.
I love you, honey, please...

1582
01:22:44,310 --> 01:22:46,176
Yeah, I love you too.
Go to hell.

1583
01:22:49,116 --> 01:22:50,946
- Hey, Ma.
- Hey, sweetheart.

1584
01:22:52,019 --> 01:22:53,781
- Guess what.
- What?

1585
01:22:53,853 --> 01:22:56,151
Harry took me to his lawyer
to sign a contract with him.

1586
01:22:56,222 --> 01:22:58,588
- He's my manager now.
- He did what?

1587
01:22:58,658 --> 01:23:00,684
Yeah, I sent some
footage to a pro scout.

1588
01:23:00,761 --> 01:23:02,660
I don't know
how the word got out,

1589
01:23:02,729 --> 01:23:06,166
but next thing I know, there's bunch
of agents at the gym pressuring Mike.

1590
01:23:06,233 --> 01:23:09,532
You know, I had him sign something...
so they wouldn't take advantage of him.

1591
01:23:09,603 --> 01:23:13,094
- Harry knows his stuff, Mama.
- I know a little bit.

1592
01:23:13,172 --> 01:23:15,403
Michael, why don't you
go check on your sisters,

1593
01:23:15,476 --> 01:23:18,673
- make sure they wash up?
- Okay.

1594
01:23:21,014 --> 01:23:22,913
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1595
01:23:24,017 --> 01:23:26,417
You been awful quiet
the last few days.

1596
01:23:26,487 --> 01:23:28,317
I'm fine.

1597
01:23:28,387 --> 01:23:30,219
Harry, can I
ask you something?

1598
01:23:30,290 --> 01:23:32,121
Yeah.

1599
01:23:33,193 --> 01:23:36,026
What's in this for you?

1600
01:23:36,096 --> 01:23:39,065
- What are you talking about?
- Why is he so important to you?

1601
01:23:39,133 --> 01:23:41,624
- Hmm?
- l...

1602
01:23:41,702 --> 01:23:44,000
- Hmm.
- Mike's a good kid.

1603
01:23:44,071 --> 01:23:45,936
He's a talented kid.

1604
01:23:47,708 --> 01:23:49,232
What are you
talking about?

1605
01:23:51,245 --> 01:23:53,611
I don't like you spending
all this time with him.

1606
01:23:53,680 --> 01:23:57,139
And I don't understand why you're
sending footage to pro scouts.

1607
01:23:58,218 --> 01:23:59,776
Trying to... trying to help.

1608
01:23:59,853 --> 01:24:01,514
Why? Why? What for?

1609
01:24:01,588 --> 01:24:03,079
What's in it for you?

1610
01:24:03,157 --> 01:24:05,387
I mean, if he gets
a million-dollar contract,

1611
01:24:05,459 --> 01:24:07,154
you think you
gonna get your cut?

1612
01:24:07,227 --> 01:24:08,661
Is this some
kinda game to you?

1613
01:24:08,730 --> 01:24:10,321
Whoa whoa whoa, hold on.

1614
01:24:10,397 --> 01:24:13,423
Where is this coming from?

1615
01:24:13,500 --> 01:24:16,492
Huh? What, have that many men hurt
you that you can't trust one?

1616
01:24:16,570 --> 01:24:18,538
This ain't about me, all right?

1617
01:24:18,605 --> 01:24:20,631
This is about you.

1618
01:24:20,708 --> 01:24:22,733
Now, how much gambling
debt are you in?

1619
01:24:22,811 --> 01:24:24,971
You didn't think
I'd hear about that?

1620
01:24:32,220 --> 01:24:35,655
- You think I'm in it for some money?
- Well, are you?

1621
01:24:35,722 --> 01:24:37,156
Is that what you think of me?

1622
01:24:37,225 --> 01:24:39,989
Should that be
what I think of you?

1623
01:24:40,061 --> 01:24:43,861
- Brenda...
- You're not going to be his manager.

1624
01:24:46,267 --> 01:24:48,827
- Brenda...
- No, just go. Go. Go, please.

1625
01:24:48,903 --> 01:24:53,430
I paid all of my gambling debts.
I don't owe anybody anything.

1626
01:24:54,976 --> 01:24:56,910
Get out.

1627
01:25:12,694 --> 01:25:14,719
Oh, hell. I'm running out of gas.

1628
01:25:14,796 --> 01:25:16,662
Pull your car over to the side.

1629
01:25:16,732 --> 01:25:19,063
Cora, here.

1630
01:25:20,168 --> 01:25:23,194
Go bail your mama out.
Give her this $20.

1631
01:25:23,271 --> 01:25:24,966
What... what is this for?

1632
01:25:25,039 --> 01:25:26,734
It's for back child support.

1633
01:25:26,808 --> 01:25:28,470
Back...

1634
01:25:28,544 --> 01:25:30,602
I owe it to ya.

1635
01:25:30,678 --> 01:25:32,202
And there it is.

1636
01:25:32,280 --> 01:25:34,647
- As fast as it started...
- Oh, they got her.

1637
01:25:34,717 --> 01:25:36,149
But it still has gone down

1638
01:25:36,217 --> 01:25:39,152
as one of the longest
police pursuits in history.

1639
01:25:39,220 --> 01:25:41,780
What the hell? They gonna
send "helichoppers"

1640
01:25:41,856 --> 01:25:43,824
and all these police cars
for a little old woman.

1641
01:25:43,892 --> 01:25:46,759
- Get out of the vehicle now.
- Don't shoot.

1642
01:25:46,828 --> 01:25:50,264
I'm getting out of the car.
They gonna lock your ass up.

1643
01:25:52,167 --> 01:25:54,761
I ain't got no weapon.

1644
01:25:54,837 --> 01:25:56,498
I ain't never do nothing wrong.

1645
01:25:56,572 --> 01:25:58,835
- You gonna leave me up here...
- I ain't got no weapon.

1646
01:25:58,907 --> 01:26:01,001
All of this for me, huh?

1647
01:26:02,378 --> 01:26:04,675
What the hell you
got me surrounded for?

1648
01:26:04,746 --> 01:26:07,579
She got a gun!
She... she kidnapped me.

1649
01:26:07,649 --> 01:26:10,915
Get out of your
vehicle with your hands up.

1650
01:26:18,360 --> 01:26:20,123
Very slowly!
Very slowly!

1651
01:26:23,465 --> 01:26:24,956
Put your hands
on the car, ma'am.

1652
01:26:25,035 --> 01:26:26,729
- Hands on the car right now...
- Hold on one minute.

1653
01:26:26,802 --> 01:26:29,066
- Let me tell you something here.
- Put your hands on the car.

1654
01:26:29,138 --> 01:26:31,936
I ain't finna put my hands on the car
'cause my hands is hurtin'.

1655
01:26:32,007 --> 01:26:33,771
- Ma'am, put your hands...
- Who the hell you talkin' to?

1656
01:26:33,843 --> 01:26:35,605
- You don't want...
- Put your hands on the car!

1657
01:26:35,678 --> 01:26:37,441
- You ain't gonna take me down!
- Settle down, ma'am!

1658
01:26:37,513 --> 01:26:38,981
Put your hands on the car now.

1659
01:26:39,049 --> 01:26:40,948
I'm Madea!

1660
01:26:41,016 --> 01:26:43,007
There's another charge.

1661
01:26:43,085 --> 01:26:45,247
And another charge.

1662
01:26:45,322 --> 01:26:48,553
- Man down! Man down!
- Another charge. That's six more years.

1663
01:26:48,625 --> 01:26:50,650
Get her off me!

1664
01:26:52,828 --> 01:26:55,319
One, two, three!

1665
01:26:57,400 --> 01:26:59,129
You giving me a mammogram!

1666
01:26:59,202 --> 01:27:00,691
Hell, you ain't going...

1667
01:27:02,305 --> 01:27:04,295
Get in the car, ma'am.
Get in the car.

1668
01:27:04,373 --> 01:27:07,240
Get in the car.

1669
01:27:07,310 --> 01:27:10,279
- Transport chase suspect. Over.
- Affirmative.

1670
01:27:13,883 --> 01:27:16,408
- Stay back, people.
- All right, everybody.

1671
01:27:41,479 --> 01:27:43,070
Just a minute.

1672
01:27:47,084 --> 01:27:49,517
- Hi. How may I help you?
- Yeah, I'm Richard Carney.

1673
01:27:49,586 --> 01:27:52,282
I'm looking for Brenda
and Michael Brown.

1674
01:27:52,355 --> 01:27:55,814
- What about?
- I'm a sports agent and, well, can we talk?

1675
01:27:55,893 --> 01:27:58,190
Uh, what about?
How'd you get my address?

1676
01:27:58,261 --> 01:28:00,286
Ma, Ma, please.

1677
01:28:03,433 --> 01:28:05,026
Come on in.

1678
01:28:06,569 --> 01:28:08,037
Hi.

1679
01:28:08,105 --> 01:28:09,628
- How you doing?
- Good.

1680
01:28:11,042 --> 01:28:13,340
I sent your son's tape
to two professional teams.

1681
01:28:14,378 --> 01:28:16,209
And they were very impressed.

1682
01:28:16,280 --> 01:28:17,712
I've already got two teams

1683
01:28:17,781 --> 01:28:20,250
that are interested
in signing him right now.

1684
01:28:20,317 --> 01:28:21,875
- Really?
- Yes.

1685
01:28:21,952 --> 01:28:23,816
And I can make a really
good deal for your son.

1686
01:28:25,222 --> 01:28:27,747
So what do you want to do?

1687
01:28:27,825 --> 01:28:29,451
Hmm?

1688
01:28:29,526 --> 01:28:31,017
What do you think?

1689
01:28:34,432 --> 01:28:35,990
So what about college?

1690
01:28:36,067 --> 01:28:37,659
We'll have you take
college courses,

1691
01:28:37,735 --> 01:28:39,828
- even help you get a degree.
- Mama...

1692
01:28:46,377 --> 01:28:48,038
Let's do it.

1693
01:28:48,112 --> 01:28:49,977
- Okay. All right.
- Yeah?

1694
01:28:50,047 --> 01:28:52,744
- Mm-hmm.
- Let's do it.

1695
01:28:52,818 --> 01:28:54,717
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1696
01:28:54,785 --> 01:28:58,313
Um, he signed a contract
with someone to be his manager.

1697
01:28:58,390 --> 01:29:01,325
Does that person have any legal grounds
to any of his money?

1698
01:29:01,393 --> 01:29:03,155
- You mean Harry Belton?
- Yeah.

1699
01:29:03,227 --> 01:29:06,355
That contract didn't ask for money.
It was more of a guidance thing.

1700
01:29:06,430 --> 01:29:07,920
He wasn't even trying to get paid.

1701
01:29:07,998 --> 01:29:10,194
I guess with all of his
knowledge of this business,

1702
01:29:10,268 --> 01:29:12,327
he just didn't want him
to be taken advantage of.

1703
01:29:16,041 --> 01:29:18,100
Listen, Miss Brown,

1704
01:29:18,176 --> 01:29:19,836
I'll be in touch in a week, okay?

1705
01:29:19,910 --> 01:29:21,742
And you, young man,

1706
01:29:21,813 --> 01:29:24,543
- you get ready.
- Yes, sir.

1707
01:29:24,616 --> 01:29:28,574
We'd like to say that the Thunderhawks
are very happy to have him onboard.

1708
01:29:28,652 --> 01:29:31,621
A million dollars is a lot of money...

1709
01:29:31,689 --> 01:29:34,658
- I'm his daddy.
...are other players going to be jealous...

1710
01:29:34,725 --> 01:29:36,626
Hey, son, how you doing?

1711
01:29:36,695 --> 01:29:38,526
Look, son, can I holler
at you a minute?

1712
01:29:38,597 --> 01:29:42,465
- Mama.
- He's still your daddy.

1713
01:29:42,534 --> 01:29:45,196
- What is he to me?
- I just want to say congratulations, boy.

1714
01:29:45,270 --> 01:29:47,465
- I'm proud of you. You did it.
- Hey hey hey.

1715
01:29:47,539 --> 01:29:50,702
When you had the chance to be in my life,
you didn't want no part of me.

1716
01:29:50,775 --> 01:29:52,936
You should have thought
about all this before.

1717
01:29:53,011 --> 01:29:55,172
Hey, now, come on.
Don't be like that.

1718
01:29:55,247 --> 01:29:56,680
I don't know why you here, man.

1719
01:29:56,748 --> 01:29:58,272
That $25 an hour is waiting on you.

1720
01:29:58,350 --> 01:29:59,977
What position is he
going to play?

1721
01:30:00,051 --> 01:30:03,579
Coach, what do you think Mike's
gonna do with all the money?

1722
01:30:03,656 --> 01:30:05,885
Why don't we let Mike
answer that question?

1723
01:30:05,957 --> 01:30:09,189
Mike, what are you gonna
do with all that money?

1724
01:30:10,962 --> 01:30:12,487
Make sure my mom and my sisters

1725
01:30:12,565 --> 01:30:15,125
are taken care of.

1726
01:30:15,201 --> 01:30:18,761
- And he's gonna finish school.
- And finish school.

1727
01:30:18,837 --> 01:30:20,897
Hey, Mike, what are you
gonna do for your dad?

1728
01:30:20,973 --> 01:30:23,441
- Who?
- Isn't that your father?

1729
01:30:23,509 --> 01:30:25,032
Well, that's funny.

1730
01:30:25,110 --> 01:30:27,409
I've... I've seen my father
twice since I was four.

1731
01:30:29,048 --> 01:30:30,537
My mom's been breaking her back

1732
01:30:30,615 --> 01:30:33,084
to make sure my sisters and I

1733
01:30:33,152 --> 01:30:34,813
had food on the table.

1734
01:30:34,887 --> 01:30:37,447
We lived in the projects
while he went on

1735
01:30:37,523 --> 01:30:40,686
and started his life with someone else
living the good life,

1736
01:30:40,760 --> 01:30:44,355
but somehow he seemed
to make it to my big day.

1737
01:30:44,430 --> 01:30:47,922
Why don't I let my dad answer that
for you? Come on, Dad.

1738
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:49,763
Are you proud of your son?

1739
01:30:49,835 --> 01:30:51,598
What was he like as a kid?

1740
01:30:51,671 --> 01:30:53,605
How were his grades
growing up?

1741
01:30:53,673 --> 01:30:56,335
- Tell us about the moves he got from you.
- Favorite game memory?

1742
01:30:56,409 --> 01:30:58,400
Well, l... you know,
that was a long time ago.

1743
01:30:58,477 --> 01:31:01,674
He's always been a good boy.
He's always been real athletic

1744
01:31:01,747 --> 01:31:04,545
and... and he's always
loved his basketball.

1745
01:31:04,617 --> 01:31:06,414
How do you feel
about your son's comments?

1746
01:31:08,689 --> 01:31:10,246
Hey, you... you know, it...

1747
01:31:11,858 --> 01:31:13,620
you know what?

1748
01:31:13,693 --> 01:31:15,490
Are you gonna spend
more time with him now?

1749
01:31:15,561 --> 01:31:17,587
That's up to my boy.
That's up to Mike.

1750
01:31:17,664 --> 01:31:19,962
- I hope so.
- With you showing up at this time,

1751
01:31:20,033 --> 01:31:22,763
some folks would consider
that gold digging.

1752
01:31:22,836 --> 01:31:25,133
But hey, this is
all about my son, right?

1753
01:31:25,204 --> 01:31:26,796
This is all about
my boy, all right?

1754
01:31:26,872 --> 01:31:29,137
This is not about me.

1755
01:31:41,221 --> 01:31:42,882
This isn't the way home.

1756
01:31:42,956 --> 01:31:44,513
Yeah, I know.

1757
01:31:45,559 --> 01:31:47,254
What?

1758
01:31:48,996 --> 01:31:50,428
Ma, you were wrong about Harry.

1759
01:31:50,496 --> 01:31:53,159
Michael, you don't know
nothing about that, okay?

1760
01:31:53,233 --> 01:31:56,066
No, that's a good dude, Mama.

1761
01:31:56,136 --> 01:31:58,104
And you need to fix it.

1762
01:31:58,171 --> 01:32:01,334
Well, isn't that
what you would tell me?

1763
01:32:04,344 --> 01:32:05,811
Yeah.

1764
01:32:07,414 --> 01:32:09,143
He's in there.

1765
01:32:42,650 --> 01:32:44,139
Hey.

1766
01:32:49,623 --> 01:32:51,114
Hey.

1767
01:32:52,793 --> 01:32:56,229
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

1768
01:32:56,296 --> 01:32:57,764
Talent, attitude, skill.

1769
01:32:57,832 --> 01:33:00,164
He deserves it.

1770
01:33:00,234 --> 01:33:02,225
Thank you
for all your help.

1771
01:33:05,139 --> 01:33:06,663
It's all good.

1772
01:33:10,277 --> 01:33:12,178
You know, um...

1773
01:33:12,246 --> 01:33:14,009
I can pay you back now

1774
01:33:14,082 --> 01:33:16,744
for all you did for us...

1775
01:33:16,818 --> 01:33:18,786
the house, the move,

1776
01:33:18,853 --> 01:33:20,616
everything.

1777
01:33:20,688 --> 01:33:23,953
- You don't get it, do you?
- Get what?

1778
01:33:24,025 --> 01:33:26,255
I didn't do all of that
so you could pay me back.

1779
01:33:26,327 --> 01:33:27,920
I'm sorry.

1780
01:33:29,330 --> 01:33:31,992
I'm just so used to being
taken advantage of...

1781
01:33:32,066 --> 01:33:34,591
Yeah, that you don't even know
when somebody loves you.

1782
01:33:36,305 --> 01:33:37,828
You love me?

1783
01:33:39,708 --> 01:33:41,174
Yeah.

1784
01:33:43,277 --> 01:33:45,303
Tell Mike I said congratulations.

1785
01:33:56,458 --> 01:34:00,121
Hey, what if I told you
I love you too,

1786
01:34:00,195 --> 01:34:02,595
but I just got scared for a second,

1787
01:34:02,664 --> 01:34:06,361
but I'd rather be scared and with you

1788
01:34:06,434 --> 01:34:10,201
than not scared and not have you?

1789
01:34:12,141 --> 01:34:14,200
What... why would I scare you?

1790
01:34:19,548 --> 01:34:22,779
Because you're everything
I always wanted in a man.

1791
01:34:24,420 --> 01:34:26,820
Then let me be that for you.

1792
01:35:14,237 --> 01:35:17,070
Cora, do you miss
your granddaddy?

1793
01:35:18,741 --> 01:35:20,208
I never met him.

1794
01:35:20,276 --> 01:35:22,574
- You what?
- I never met him.

1795
01:35:22,645 --> 01:35:24,670
Let me introduce you
to your granddaddy.

1796
01:35:26,149 --> 01:35:29,880
- He dead.
- Cora, that man died, but he can still hear.

1797
01:35:29,953 --> 01:35:32,820
Whoo! Don't you know
that angels got ears, Cora?

1798
01:35:32,889 --> 01:35:34,413
Come here, Cora.

1799
01:35:34,491 --> 01:35:37,460
You got to meet him.
Look the way he dressed.

1800
01:35:37,527 --> 01:35:38,960
Look at Daddy.

1801
01:35:39,028 --> 01:35:41,588
Cora, our daddy was ugly,
but he was our daddy.

1802
01:35:42,932 --> 01:35:44,422
Yes, he was. Cora, look at him.

1803
01:35:44,501 --> 01:35:45,934
This is your granddaddy.

1804
01:35:46,002 --> 01:35:48,266
- Don't touch it.
- That's our granddaddy.

1805
01:35:48,338 --> 01:35:49,772
It's our granddaddy.

1806
01:35:49,840 --> 01:35:51,670
- Cora... look at him, Cora.
- I'm looking at him.

1807
01:35:51,741 --> 01:35:54,175
Look at him!
Look down at him!

1808
01:35:54,244 --> 01:35:56,371
Look at him!

1809
01:35:56,446 --> 01:35:57,674
Look down
at him!

1810
01:35:57,747 --> 01:36:00,716
Go up close, Cora.
Cora, look... look... kiss him.

1811
01:36:00,783 --> 01:36:02,842
Kiss your granddaddy.
Kiss him on the forehead.

1812
01:36:02,919 --> 01:36:04,148
Huh-uh,
huh-uh, huh-uh!

1813
01:36:04,221 --> 01:36:05,949
Let her alone!

1814
01:36:06,022 --> 01:36:07,887
How strong is your faith?

1815
01:36:07,957 --> 01:36:09,687
You believe he can come back?

1816
01:36:09,760 --> 01:36:11,954
You believe he can
be like Nazareth?

1817
01:36:12,028 --> 01:36:14,155
Put your hand
on his heart, Cora.

1818
01:36:14,230 --> 01:36:15,664
You can beat some life in...

1819
01:36:15,733 --> 01:36:17,963
beat his heart, Cora!
Beat into him, Cora!

1820
01:36:18,035 --> 01:36:20,025
Don't touch my daddy!

1821
01:36:20,103 --> 01:36:22,129
Cora, I just wanted
you to have...

1822
01:36:22,206 --> 01:36:24,037
this is your daddy, Cora.

1823
01:36:24,108 --> 01:36:26,440
Cora, look at him.
You know who this is?

1824
01:36:26,510 --> 01:36:30,310
- My granddaddy?
- # This is your granddaddy #

1825
01:36:30,381 --> 01:36:33,873
# This is your granddaddy #

1826
01:36:33,951 --> 01:36:36,545
# This is your granddaddy,
your granddaddy #

1827
01:36:36,620 --> 01:36:39,817
# Your granddaddy... #

1828
01:36:39,890 --> 01:36:41,187
Sing it!

1829
01:36:41,258 --> 01:36:43,316
# This is your
granddaddy... #

1830
01:36:43,393 --> 01:36:46,295
# This is your granddaddy #

1831
01:36:46,363 --> 01:36:48,991
# Your granddaddy,
your granddaddy. #

1832
01:36:49,065 --> 01:36:50,931
Sing it!

1833
01:36:51,001 --> 01:36:53,231
This movie's been pretty deep so far,

1834
01:36:53,304 --> 01:36:54,795
so let's have a good time.

1835
01:36:55,873 --> 01:36:57,306
Cora, I'm trying...

1836
01:36:57,374 --> 01:36:59,069
It's okay. It's okay.

1837
01:36:59,143 --> 01:37:01,668
Please, you have
to open your eyes.

1838
01:37:02,880 --> 01:37:05,348
Hello. Yeah.

1839
01:37:05,416 --> 01:37:06,906
You mean... I'm driving.

1840
01:37:06,984 --> 01:37:08,508
They tell you you can't be talking

1841
01:37:08,586 --> 01:37:10,451
on your cell phone
while you driving.

1842
01:37:10,521 --> 01:37:13,183
Hey!

1843
01:37:13,257 --> 01:37:15,556
Yeah, I'm gonna pray now.
Thank you.

1844
01:37:15,627 --> 01:37:17,754
Y'all bow your heads.

1845
01:37:17,829 --> 01:37:19,557
Bow your heads, I'm praying.

1846
01:37:19,630 --> 01:37:21,428
Heavenly Father,

1847
01:37:21,499 --> 01:37:24,491
I ask that You would
put them chickens back in that coop

1848
01:37:24,568 --> 01:37:26,196
so she can get eggs...

1849
01:37:26,271 --> 01:37:28,295
...to make her pies
and cakes for the church.

1850
01:37:28,372 --> 01:37:30,932
- I need you to watch the road.
- We thank You... help, Cora, turn.

1851
01:37:31,008 --> 01:37:32,943
We thank you, Lord,
that You have made a way

1852
01:37:33,011 --> 01:37:34,706
for her to make cakes for the church.

1853
01:37:34,779 --> 01:37:36,473
Bless them chickens!

1854
01:37:36,547 --> 01:37:37,981
- Yes.
- Amen. Amen.

1855
01:37:38,049 --> 01:37:39,141
Amen.

1856
01:37:39,217 --> 01:37:41,117
I promise you I didn't know.

1857
01:37:41,186 --> 01:37:43,484
Anybody feel bereaved?

1858
01:37:43,555 --> 01:37:46,490
Why so many people from
the Bereaved family die?

1859
01:37:46,558 --> 01:37:49,288
- I'm bereaved now.
- I don't know why so many...

1860
01:37:49,361 --> 01:37:51,659
peoples are always dying
in the Bereaved family.

1861
01:37:51,730 --> 01:37:55,291
Every time you read the paper,
it say the Bereaved family.

1862
01:37:55,367 --> 01:37:57,232
They gonna run out

01:37:57,302 --> 01:37:58,826
if they keep on dying.

1865
01:38:00,872 --> 01:38:03,102
I didn't even know she was kin
of the Bereaved family.

1866
01:38:03,174 --> 01:38:05,665
Whoo. Cora, don't go

1867
01:38:05,745 --> 01:38:07,575
It ain't worth it.
It ain't worth it.

1868
01:38:07,646 --> 01:38:10,012
- Don't tell me to calm...
- Cora, just relax.

1869
01:38:10,081 --> 01:38:11,709
- Don't do it, Cora.

01:38:11,784 --> 01:38:13,444

1871
01:38:13,518 --> 01:38:14,985
Cora, just sit down.

1872
01:38:15,053 --> 01:38:17,851
Ooh, you gonna be in that
jail and you gonna rot.

1873
01:38:17,922 --> 01:38:19,914
You gonna rot if

1874
01:38:19,992 --> 01:38:22,118
Don't do it.

01:38:22,193 --> 01:38:24,423
And cut.

1876
01:38:26,265 --> 01:38:27,891

01:38:27,966 --> 01:38:30,400
