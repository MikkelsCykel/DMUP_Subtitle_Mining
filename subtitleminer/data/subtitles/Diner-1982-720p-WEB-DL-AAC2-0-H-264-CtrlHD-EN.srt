00:00:49,845 --> 00:00:51,138
- Hi.
- Hi, girls.

3
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:54,517
How are you?

4
00:01:26,423 --> 00:01:28,717
- Eddie, have you seen Boogie?
- He's over there.

5
00:01:35,015 --> 00:01:36,642
Boogie! Come here.

6
00:01:40,646 --> 00:01:43,023
I was just downstairs in the basement.

7
00:01:43,107 --> 00:01:45,818
Fenwick is breaking windows
with his bare hands.

8
00:01:45,943 --> 00:01:48,529
He's punching out the windows
with his bare hands.

9
00:01:48,612 --> 00:01:50,906
And he'll break every one in the place.

10
00:01:51,031 --> 00:01:52,533
I'll go talk to him.

11
00:02:07,631 --> 00:02:08,841
What's up, Fen?

12
00:02:10,634 --> 00:02:12,845
Just breakin' windows, Boog.

13
00:02:17,224 --> 00:02:18,225
What for?

14
00:02:19,143 --> 00:02:20,436
It's a smile.

15
00:02:24,023 --> 00:02:25,733
Come on, don't be a schmuck.

16
00:02:25,816 --> 00:02:28,736
I know glass is made from sand.

17
00:02:29,612 --> 00:02:31,614
How come you can see through it?

18
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:35,117
Leave the windows alone.
What's wrong with you?

19
00:02:35,242 --> 00:02:38,412
- It's a smile, that's all.
- Yeah, I'm cracking up.

20
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:43,542
Fenwick, you break another window,
and I'm gonna give you a fat lip.

21
00:02:46,128 --> 00:02:48,047
Now, where's your date?

22
00:02:48,839 --> 00:02:50,341
Gave her away.

23
00:02:51,717 --> 00:02:52,510
What?

24
00:02:52,635 --> 00:02:55,930
I gave her away.
David Frazer said she was death.

25
00:02:56,013 --> 00:02:59,225
So, I said, "If you like the way
she looks, take her."

26
00:03:00,226 --> 00:03:02,436
What are you, the Salvation Army?

27
00:03:02,436 --> 00:03:04,522
I charged him $5.

28
00:03:08,025 --> 00:03:09,610
Come on upstairs.

29
00:03:11,111 --> 00:03:12,238
Come on.

30
00:03:16,408 --> 00:03:17,618
You really are nuts.

31
00:03:17,743 --> 00:03:20,621
What about her? She didn't have to go.
I'm nuts. Get that.

32
00:03:20,621 --> 00:03:22,831
That's what you get
for dating 11th-graders.

33
00:03:22,831 --> 00:03:25,709
- Her brains aren't developed yet.
- Yeah, but her tits were.

34
00:03:25,835 --> 00:03:26,919
Falsies.

35
00:03:27,044 --> 00:03:29,129
- Were they?
- Firsthand info.

36
00:03:29,839 --> 00:03:32,007
Shit. Then what am I pissed about?

37
00:03:40,516 --> 00:03:43,727
- It looks like you're having a lot of fun.
- Perk up.

38
00:03:44,228 --> 00:03:47,439
- How could you take Frazer over the Fen?
- 'Cause.

39
00:03:49,024 --> 00:03:52,736
Diane, did you know that Frazer
paid $5 for you?

40
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,738
That's the kind of guy he is.

41
00:03:54,947 --> 00:03:56,031
He did?

42
00:03:58,617 --> 00:04:01,120
Do you want to leave with Frazer?

43
00:04:02,621 --> 00:04:05,207
Not really. Fenwick scares me.

44
00:04:05,708 --> 00:04:07,042
He's all right.

45
00:04:07,209 --> 00:04:09,044
Why don't you take me home?

46
00:04:09,336 --> 00:04:12,047
I go to law school now.
I have to go home and study.

47
00:04:12,047 --> 00:04:16,510
The only reason I came by here is
'cause I appreciate the fine music.

48
00:04:17,511 --> 00:04:21,348
- I thought you worked in a beauty parlor.
- Yeah, I do, during the day.

49
00:04:22,141 --> 00:04:25,519
Would you do me a favor?
Would you go home with the Fen?

50
00:04:27,229 --> 00:04:28,314
Okay?

51
00:04:28,814 --> 00:04:29,815
Okay?

52
00:04:42,828 --> 00:04:44,538
- Are you cold?
- No.

53
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:46,749
I could turn the heat on.

54
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:53,339
Elyse feels that Eddie is getting
very sensitive about the wedding.

55
00:04:53,422 --> 00:04:55,508
Yeah, I know. We were talking about it.

56
00:04:57,718 --> 00:05:00,429
You know what word
I'm not comfortable with?

57
00:05:00,513 --> 00:05:05,142
"Nuance." It's not a real word.
Like "gesture." "Gesture" is a good word.

58
00:05:05,309 --> 00:05:07,728
At least you know where you stand
with gesture.

59
00:05:07,728 --> 00:05:11,732
But, "nuance," I don't know.
Maybe I'm wrong.

60
00:05:13,817 --> 00:05:16,946
- Aren't you chilly?
- No, I feel good. I feel good.

61
00:05:17,112 --> 00:05:19,240
- Am I going too fast for you?
- No. No.

62
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,241
Good.

63
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:35,422
Look at that Fenwick go.

64
00:05:43,931 --> 00:05:46,642
Elyse's mother is very upset with Eddie.

65
00:05:46,642 --> 00:05:49,645
They picked out this yellow and white
motif for the wedding.

66
00:05:49,645 --> 00:05:52,815
You know, like we did.
Napkins, tablecloths, bridesmaids...

67
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:56,610
...maid of honor, the whole bit.
Anyway, Eddie objected.

68
00:05:56,944 --> 00:05:59,947
He wanted blue and white,
the Colt's colors.

69
00:06:00,239 --> 00:06:01,824
He refused to give in.

70
00:06:02,533 --> 00:06:03,325
So?

71
00:06:04,326 --> 00:06:06,328
You know how stubborn Eddie is.

72
00:06:07,913 --> 00:06:09,540
Could have been worse.

73
00:06:09,623 --> 00:06:12,543
Could have been black and gold,
the Steeler's colors.

74
00:06:14,628 --> 00:06:16,922
Billy's coming in on a train this morning.

75
00:06:16,922 --> 00:06:19,717
I thought he was just coming in
for the wedding.

76
00:06:19,717 --> 00:06:22,845
We didn't want to mention it.
It's a surprise for Eddie.

77
00:06:22,928 --> 00:06:25,639
- What the hell's going on?
- I don't know.

78
00:06:40,738 --> 00:06:41,947
Stay here.

79
00:06:47,244 --> 00:06:48,412
Oh, Jesus.

80
00:06:56,629 --> 00:06:58,339
You son of a bitch.

81
00:07:01,425 --> 00:07:03,427
I really got you guys, didn't I?

82
00:07:03,636 --> 00:07:07,431
I've been carrying this ketchup bottle
around for weeks.

83
00:07:10,142 --> 00:07:11,227
You asshole.

84
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:12,311
Weeks!

85
00:07:12,937 --> 00:07:16,649
I hid behind the car. I didn't want
to get any ketchup on my dress.

86
00:07:16,649 --> 00:07:19,527
Weeks! Just waitin' for the right time.

87
00:07:20,236 --> 00:07:24,114
Well, you got me. Christ, I really thought
you'd bought it.

88
00:07:24,323 --> 00:07:27,743
Real hard, holdin' back the laughs.
Real hard.

89
00:07:29,328 --> 00:07:31,247
You really outdid yourself, Fenwick.

90
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:33,040
That's very mature, Fenwick.

91
00:07:33,249 --> 00:07:34,542
Fuck mature.

92
00:07:36,335 --> 00:07:37,628
Sorry, Beth.

93
00:07:38,212 --> 00:07:40,214
Did you overturn this yourself?

94
00:07:40,339 --> 00:07:42,633
Yeah, give me a hand.

95
00:07:44,635 --> 00:07:45,636
No way.

96
00:07:47,137 --> 00:07:48,722
Come on, guys.

97
00:07:49,932 --> 00:07:52,726
Boog? Modell, come on.

98
00:07:53,727 --> 00:07:55,312
Hey, guys, come on.

99
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:01,235
Fenwick, you turned it over by yourself.
You've got to turn it back.

100
00:08:01,235 --> 00:08:04,029
But it was easy gettin' it over,
'cause of the angle.

101
00:08:04,029 --> 00:08:05,739
It'll be a bitch getting it...

102
00:08:05,823 --> 00:08:09,034
Come on. Did you try it?
I'll bet you didn't even try it yet.

103
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:11,912
I'm buyin' at the diner.

104
00:08:13,831 --> 00:08:15,541
Fenwick, you're a schmuck.

105
00:08:15,624 --> 00:08:18,544
Another five seconds,
you would've had it for free.

106
00:08:23,716 --> 00:08:26,343
I'll see you guys later at the diner, okay?

107
00:08:29,013 --> 00:08:31,432
You're a sick person, you know that?

108
00:08:31,515 --> 00:08:33,350
You're not a normal person.

109
00:08:33,642 --> 00:08:36,312
You guys really are sick, you know that?

110
00:08:36,645 --> 00:08:39,648
- That's 'cause you got no sense of humor.
- Yeah, right.

111
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:02,546
You can't compare Mathis to Sinatra.
There's no way, no way.

112
00:09:02,713 --> 00:09:05,216
They're in totally different leagues.

113
00:09:05,216 --> 00:09:07,635
Eddie, they're both great singers.

114
00:09:07,635 --> 00:09:10,930
You know the thing about Sinatra,
he's good, but he's too thin.

115
00:09:11,013 --> 00:09:12,223
I don't like that.

116
00:09:12,348 --> 00:09:16,810
Yeah, but you can't compare them.
Sinatra is the Lord. All right?

117
00:09:17,144 --> 00:09:19,813
He's big in movies. He's big in nightclubs.

118
00:09:20,147 --> 00:09:22,149
Let me ask you another question:

119
00:09:22,942 --> 00:09:25,945
Who do you make-out to?
Sinatra or Mathis?

120
00:09:28,113 --> 00:09:30,824
- That's a stupid question.
- One question, answer that.

121
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:33,744
It's irrelevant. I won't answer it. Mathis.

122
00:09:34,245 --> 00:09:36,539
There you go. How about you, Shrevie?

123
00:09:37,122 --> 00:09:40,251
- I'm married. We don't make out.
- That's funny.

124
00:09:41,126 --> 00:09:43,420
- George, do you have a Band-Aid?
- No.

125
00:09:43,629 --> 00:09:45,631
- You have a Band-Aid.
- I don't have one.

126
00:09:45,714 --> 00:09:47,341
- What's wrong?
- I don't know.

127
00:09:47,341 --> 00:09:49,635
- You don't know?
- I cut myself shaving.

128
00:09:49,635 --> 00:09:53,222
Sorry about that Diane thing.
I didn't know you had a thing for her.

129
00:09:53,347 --> 00:09:54,849
Yeah, it's okay.

130
00:09:54,932 --> 00:09:56,934
What about my $5?

131
00:09:57,017 --> 00:09:59,436
- Give me a couple of days.
- A couple days?

132
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:02,314
Can I have French fries and gravy,
with a cherry Coke?

133
00:10:02,439 --> 00:10:05,234
Sinatra doesn't like fatty foods, I think.

134
00:10:05,943 --> 00:10:07,528
Look who's here.

135
00:10:07,945 --> 00:10:08,946
How'd it go?

136
00:10:08,946 --> 00:10:11,532
Pretty good. Said she never wanted
to see me again.

137
00:10:11,532 --> 00:10:13,617
You're a charming person, you know that?

138
00:10:13,742 --> 00:10:14,743
What happened?

139
00:10:14,743 --> 00:10:19,039
I just parked the car on a nice, lonely road.
I looked at her and I said, "Fuck or fight?"

140
00:10:19,123 --> 00:10:21,625
That's a good line.
I'll use that myself sometime.

141
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:22,835
You're a maniac.

142
00:10:22,918 --> 00:10:25,337
You always know exactly what to say.
I love this.

143
00:10:25,421 --> 00:10:27,923
- How old is she?
- She's jailbait.

144
00:10:28,048 --> 00:10:29,717
- What is she, 12?
- She'll be 12.

145
00:10:29,842 --> 00:10:30,718
Jailbait.

146
00:10:30,843 --> 00:10:33,512
She's old enough to know better.
I'm kidding.

147
00:10:33,721 --> 00:10:37,516
She said she wanted to see me again.
She liked me, sort of.

148
00:10:37,933 --> 00:10:39,643
- Get out of here.
- Come on.

149
00:10:40,019 --> 00:10:43,647
George, will you come here
and talk to him? He's driving me wild.

150
00:10:50,237 --> 00:10:51,947
What's that? Roast beef?

151
00:10:52,448 --> 00:10:54,950
Don't ask me this anymore, Modell. Yes.

152
00:10:55,326 --> 00:10:56,619
You gonna finish that?

153
00:10:56,744 --> 00:11:00,748
Yeah, I'm gonna finish it. I paid for it.
I'm not gonna give it to you.

154
00:11:00,748 --> 00:11:03,125
If you're not going to finish it, I'd eat it.

155
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:06,545
- What do you want? Say it.
- Go ahead. You eat it. That's all right.

156
00:11:06,629 --> 00:11:09,840
Say, "I want the roast beef sandwich,"
and I'll give you some.

157
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:13,636
- Would you guys cut this out?
- He doesn't talk. He just...

158
00:11:13,636 --> 00:11:16,347
- You know what he means, right?
- I know what he means.

159
00:11:16,347 --> 00:11:18,516
If he'd say the words, I'd give him some.

160
00:11:18,641 --> 00:11:20,351
If I wanted it, wouldn't I ask?

161
00:11:20,351 --> 00:11:23,145
- Then ask. You know he wants it.
- Just let it go.

162
00:11:23,229 --> 00:11:24,647
You're annoying as hell.

163
00:11:24,647 --> 00:11:27,024
I'm annoying?
I'm trying to eat a meal by myself.

164
00:11:27,149 --> 00:11:30,528
If you want to give him the sandwich,
give it to him. If you don't...

165
00:11:30,611 --> 00:11:33,322
- I don't want to...
- Then eat the sandwich, and shut up.

166
00:11:33,447 --> 00:11:35,449
- Look at his eyes.
- I asked a simple question.

167
00:11:35,533 --> 00:11:38,035
Know what you're problem is?
You don't chew your food.

168
00:11:38,035 --> 00:11:40,538
That's why you get so irritable.
You get lumps.

169
00:11:40,621 --> 00:11:43,749
You have roast beef in your heart
that just stays there.

170
00:11:43,749 --> 00:11:47,628
Modell, you're really getting me mad.
My blood is boiling.

171
00:11:47,837 --> 00:11:49,421
- I'll take the sandwich.
- Don't...

172
00:11:49,421 --> 00:11:52,550
- Fine. I'll take the sandwich.
- See what you do. Every time!

173
00:11:52,633 --> 00:11:55,427
Why are you blaming me?
He took your sandwich.

174
00:11:55,636 --> 00:11:57,137
- You want this?
- No!

175
00:11:57,137 --> 00:11:58,514
- You want this?
- I don't want it.

176
00:11:58,639 --> 00:11:59,515
I do.

177
00:11:59,515 --> 00:12:02,518
I can't believe you're eating...
You two play against me.

178
00:12:02,518 --> 00:12:05,229
That's the problem.
You're both on each other's side.

179
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:10,025
Come on, George. Lend me another $10.

180
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:13,320
What do you want from me?
You owe me $10 already. Get out of here.

181
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,322
- Boog, come here.
- Don't be like that.

182
00:12:15,447 --> 00:12:16,323
Wait, Bagel.

183
00:12:16,323 --> 00:12:18,033
Come here a second, Boog.

184
00:12:18,117 --> 00:12:20,744
Get out. I don't want to talk to you.

185
00:12:24,123 --> 00:12:26,917
- What, Bagel?
- Did you lay down a bet with Barnett?

186
00:12:28,544 --> 00:12:30,629
- I don't remember.
- Yeah, right.

187
00:12:30,629 --> 00:12:33,549
Nobody bets $2,000 and forgets, Boogie.

188
00:12:34,425 --> 00:12:35,634
What's the point?

189
00:12:35,718 --> 00:12:39,013
The point is, Boog, where are you going
to get the $2,000?

190
00:12:39,138 --> 00:12:41,140
You haven't got a pot to piss in.

191
00:12:41,724 --> 00:12:43,517
Look, the game is a lock.

192
00:12:44,143 --> 00:12:47,146
Nothing's a lock, Boog. Nothing's a lock.

193
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:49,148
You want me to call it off?

194
00:12:49,231 --> 00:12:51,817
Out of respect for your father,
may he rest in peace.

195
00:12:51,817 --> 00:12:53,944
Look, leave my father out of it.

196
00:12:54,737 --> 00:12:57,114
Listen, Bagel, you should get in.

197
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:00,618
I've gotta go.

198
00:13:01,952 --> 00:13:03,245
See you around.

199
00:13:03,412 --> 00:13:05,331
- Kids, man.
- Very crazy.

200
00:13:06,123 --> 00:13:08,918
Nobody's interested in making
an honest buck anymore.

201
00:13:09,043 --> 00:13:10,628
I heard he's going to law school.

202
00:13:10,628 --> 00:13:14,215
That's what I'm talking about.
You call that an honest buck?

203
00:13:28,812 --> 00:13:31,315
Bagel heard about my basketball bet.

204
00:13:32,233 --> 00:13:34,652
I'm already down for $10.

205
00:13:35,819 --> 00:13:37,821
- Big spender.
- Come on.

206
00:13:38,447 --> 00:13:42,743
Listen, Eddie. If you guys want in on this,
I'm going to tell you now...

207
00:13:42,826 --> 00:13:46,413
...they're shaving points in this game.
- You heard they're shaving points?

208
00:13:46,539 --> 00:13:49,416
- How do you know?
- I know. This is no bullshit tip.

209
00:13:50,125 --> 00:13:52,920
I heard about your tips before.
Cost me $50.

210
00:13:53,045 --> 00:13:54,713
- How do you know?
- No way.

211
00:13:54,713 --> 00:13:56,924
- What's your resource?
- Don't get in.

212
00:13:57,216 --> 00:14:00,219
Will you listen to me?
They are shaving points on this game.

213
00:14:00,344 --> 00:14:01,554
You want in or not?

214
00:14:01,554 --> 00:14:03,931
They're definitely shaving points?
You feel secure?

215
00:14:03,931 --> 00:14:05,349
- Forget it.
- Who's the guy?

216
00:14:06,225 --> 00:14:07,852
Why do you ask so many questions?

217
00:14:07,935 --> 00:14:10,521
'Cause I don't know who the guy is.
You trust him?

218
00:14:10,521 --> 00:14:13,232
Let me make it $15. Because... make it $15.

219
00:14:13,524 --> 00:14:15,025
Let me ask you a question.

220
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:17,236
If you're really sure, make it $20.

221
00:14:17,319 --> 00:14:20,447
Don't do it, Modell.
I'm telling ya. I lost $50 last game.

222
00:14:20,531 --> 00:14:23,242
All right. Will you guys hop off
of the subject?

223
00:14:23,325 --> 00:14:25,452
- Can you quiet...?
- $15 would be good.

224
00:14:25,536 --> 00:14:28,330
Modell. Who do you pick,
Sinatra or Mathis?

225
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:32,543
- Would you just let that die? Please.
- It's important to me.

226
00:14:32,543 --> 00:14:34,628
- It's annoying me.
- It's important in my life.

227
00:14:34,753 --> 00:14:38,048
You've been asking that question
to every man that walks in here.

228
00:14:38,048 --> 00:14:39,550
Would you just forget it?

229
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:42,052
Maybe I have something to gain
from the answer.

230
00:14:42,136 --> 00:14:44,513
- Did you ever think of that?
- What does it matter?

231
00:14:44,638 --> 00:14:47,433
Let the man speak.
Let the man speak. Speak.

232
00:14:49,518 --> 00:14:50,519
Presley.

233
00:14:50,853 --> 00:14:51,937
Elvis Presley?

234
00:14:52,021 --> 00:14:54,023
There's the definitive answer.

235
00:14:54,148 --> 00:14:58,027
- Sinatra or Mathis? It's Presley. Fine.
- You're sick. You're sick.

236
00:14:58,319 --> 00:15:00,654
You feel better? Did you learn something?

237
00:15:00,738 --> 00:15:03,741
You've gone like two steps below
in my book.

238
00:15:07,036 --> 00:15:08,454
Once again...

239
00:15:09,622 --> 00:15:11,123
I guess you're full?

240
00:15:25,054 --> 00:15:29,934
Did I tell you guys that I've got a date
with Carol Heathrow tomorrow night?

241
00:15:30,226 --> 00:15:32,228
You're taking out Carol Heathrow?

242
00:15:32,353 --> 00:15:34,021
No, you're taking her out.

243
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:36,148
She is death.

244
00:15:39,151 --> 00:15:40,736
I only go for the best.

245
00:15:40,819 --> 00:15:42,321
Heathrow's cold.

246
00:15:43,113 --> 00:15:46,033
She's not a smart girl.
Did you ever talk to her?

247
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:49,620
You wanna bet she goes for my pecker
on our first date?

248
00:15:49,745 --> 00:15:52,248
The only hand on your pecker
is gonna be your own.

249
00:15:52,331 --> 00:15:55,543
Do you want to bet me?
Do you want to bet me $20?

250
00:15:56,126 --> 00:15:57,419
You got it.

251
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:00,214
- I'm in.
- Me too.

252
00:16:00,422 --> 00:16:03,717
Yeah, I'm in too,
but we need validation of this.

253
00:16:04,635 --> 00:16:06,428
All right. I'll arrange it.

254
00:16:06,637 --> 00:16:09,431
How? Are you gonna get fingerprints?

255
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:12,852
I'm tellin' ya, I'm not gonna do the dusting.

256
00:16:22,444 --> 00:16:25,823
- Did you bring your car?
- No, I walked. Yeah, I brought my car.

257
00:16:25,823 --> 00:16:27,533
You're going straight home?

258
00:16:27,616 --> 00:16:31,245
No, I'm going by way of Atlantic City.
What kind of question is that?

259
00:16:31,328 --> 00:16:33,914
'Cause if... I'll wait for the other guys.

260
00:16:34,039 --> 00:16:37,126
You constantly do this. You walk out
behind me. You stand there...

261
00:16:37,251 --> 00:16:40,337
- Maybe you got plans.
- I have no plans. It's 4:00 in the morning.

262
00:16:40,421 --> 00:16:42,631
- You want a ride?
- I'll go with you if you want.

263
00:16:42,715 --> 00:16:45,634
- You want me to go with you?
- Say the words, "I want a ride."

264
00:16:45,718 --> 00:16:46,927
I don't have to go.

265
00:16:47,052 --> 00:16:49,346
I enjoy your company. Do you want a ride?

266
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:50,431
I'll go with you.

267
00:16:50,514 --> 00:16:53,142
You got gas money? Just kidding.

268
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:55,352
You're so serious lately, Modell.

269
00:17:15,414 --> 00:17:18,334
You're too much. How'd you know
I was coming in this morning?

270
00:17:18,417 --> 00:17:20,252
We know, man. We know everything.

271
00:17:20,336 --> 00:17:21,921
You up for some diner?

272
00:17:22,046 --> 00:17:24,423
Hold on a sec.
I'm gettin' some coffee here.

273
00:17:24,548 --> 00:17:27,426
You're getting coffee before
we go to the diner to have coffee?

274
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:29,220
I want coffee. Coffee.

275
00:17:29,553 --> 00:17:32,348
I can't believe that Eddie's gettin' married.

276
00:17:32,515 --> 00:17:36,852
It's crazy. I mean, with Shrevie here,
it was nuts. But with Eddie, it's lunacy.

277
00:17:36,936 --> 00:17:39,230
Marriage is all right. I'm not complaining.

278
00:17:39,355 --> 00:17:41,649
Not complaining, huh?
That sounds wonderful.

279
00:17:41,732 --> 00:17:44,652
Of course it's not a 100-percent
sure thing yet. Right?

280
00:17:44,735 --> 00:17:47,530
- He's getting married New Year's Eve.
- No, no.

281
00:17:48,239 --> 00:17:50,115
Not until she takes the test.

282
00:17:50,449 --> 00:17:52,451
- What are you talking about?
- Tell him.

283
00:17:52,535 --> 00:17:56,455
Eddie's giving Elyse a football quiz.
If she fails, the marriage is off.

284
00:17:57,122 --> 00:18:00,251
Football quiz? Come on, you guys.
Are you puttin' me on?

285
00:18:00,334 --> 00:18:01,627
Is this a joke or what?

286
00:18:01,752 --> 00:18:04,922
No. You know Eddie and the Colts.
It's very serious stuff.

287
00:18:05,422 --> 00:18:08,926
The test has got something like, what,
140 questions.

288
00:18:09,051 --> 00:18:11,428
True and false, multiple choice,
short answer.

289
00:18:11,554 --> 00:18:14,515
It's an oral test.
He doesn't want any cheating.

290
00:18:14,515 --> 00:18:17,226
So, wait a second.
What happens if she fails?

291
00:18:17,351 --> 00:18:19,228
- He's going to call it off?
- Yeah.

292
00:18:19,353 --> 00:18:23,315
He swears to it. The test was supposed
to be two months ago.

293
00:18:23,524 --> 00:18:26,944
But Elyse keeps putting it off.
She's got a lot of pressure on her.

294
00:18:27,027 --> 00:18:27,820
I guess.

295
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:30,656
It's not the best way
to start off a marriage.

296
00:18:31,323 --> 00:18:32,741
Eddie's crazy.

297
00:18:52,553 --> 00:18:55,139
- Billy, you're missing all the action now.
- Yeah?

298
00:18:55,139 --> 00:18:58,017
Yeah. Half the guys are
at U of B night school.

299
00:18:58,642 --> 00:19:00,728
It's a lot of fucking laughs now.

300
00:19:00,936 --> 00:19:03,856
- A master's in business. That's the lowest.
- Yeah.

301
00:19:04,148 --> 00:19:06,817
What are you majoring in now, Fenwick?
Still...?

302
00:19:10,029 --> 00:19:13,449
- So, who's at U of B?
- Eddie's going, of course.

303
00:19:15,534 --> 00:19:17,453
- And then there's me.
- Yeah?

304
00:19:18,245 --> 00:19:19,955
- You going to law school?
- Yeah.

305
00:19:20,039 --> 00:19:22,249
I thought I would give it a pop.

306
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:24,919
I'm still working at the beauty salon
in the daytime.

307
00:19:25,044 --> 00:19:29,048
- But you were so good at the beauty salon.
- Cut and fuck. $2.50.

308
00:19:29,632 --> 00:19:31,133
All right, you guys laugh.

309
00:19:31,217 --> 00:19:33,844
- You ever think of doing your own hair?
- You guys laugh.

310
00:19:34,428 --> 00:19:36,430
- It looks good.
- I'll tell you something.

311
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:41,227
I get more action in a week
than you've had in your whole life.

312
00:19:41,227 --> 00:19:43,354
No, I get it every night.

313
00:19:52,238 --> 00:19:55,741
Billy. You're in town already.

314
00:19:56,617 --> 00:19:59,328
Yeah, I thought I'd come
and spend the holiday here.

315
00:19:59,453 --> 00:20:02,122
I heard there are a lot of good parties
and stuff.

316
00:20:02,248 --> 00:20:04,333
- You know your parents are out of town?
- No.

317
00:20:04,416 --> 00:20:07,044
They're in Florida.
They'll be back for Eddie's wedding.

318
00:20:07,044 --> 00:20:08,337
Is he still sleeping?

319
00:20:08,337 --> 00:20:12,633
What else? It's only 2:30. Wake him.
I can't wait till he's out of the house.

320
00:20:33,946 --> 00:20:35,739
How you doin', Bill?

321
00:20:37,032 --> 00:20:39,451
- What are you doin'?
- Don't fuck with me.

322
00:20:42,037 --> 00:20:43,831
Still the early riser, huh?

323
00:20:44,331 --> 00:20:46,250
Yeah. Nothin' changes.

324
00:20:46,542 --> 00:20:50,254
- Except you're getting married.
- Yeah. Ain't that a kick?

325
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,930
I thought you weren't coming
until New Year's Eve?

326
00:21:00,055 --> 00:21:02,850
Nothing happening around campus, so...

327
00:21:03,642 --> 00:21:06,020
Did you bring that girl with ya?

328
00:21:06,353 --> 00:21:07,646
No. We broke up.

329
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:09,732
That's a shame. You know...

330
00:21:10,733 --> 00:21:12,651
...that picture you sent me?

331
00:21:14,028 --> 00:21:16,822
It looked like she had
a great set of knockers.

332
00:21:18,741 --> 00:21:22,244
- Didn't figure on you and Elyse so soon.
- Yeah, well...

333
00:21:23,746 --> 00:21:26,457
Figured New Year's Eve would be good.

334
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:30,252
Get married. Party through the night,
you know.

335
00:21:31,253 --> 00:21:33,756
I was pissed off.
I figured you'd at least call me...

336
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:36,217
...and let me know you were planning it.

337
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:38,427
Yeah, well, you know.

338
00:21:38,719 --> 00:21:41,138
But you're my best man, right?

339
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:44,141
Right?

340
00:21:45,935 --> 00:21:48,646
What do you think?
Of course I'm your best man.

341
00:21:51,148 --> 00:21:54,527
So, Boogie and the guys picked me up
at the train station.

342
00:21:54,818 --> 00:21:55,819
Yeah?

343
00:21:57,446 --> 00:21:59,448
They didn't say anything to me.

344
00:22:00,741 --> 00:22:02,326
Surprise, I guess.

345
00:22:03,118 --> 00:22:04,119
I guess.

346
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,831
- How'd they know?
- Barbara Kohler told Fenwick.

347
00:22:08,332 --> 00:22:11,252
Oh, yeah? You keep in touch, huh?

348
00:22:11,418 --> 00:22:12,419
Yeah.

349
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:17,132
Still nailing her, aren't you, son of a bitch?

350
00:22:17,258 --> 00:22:18,425
Never did.

351
00:22:19,218 --> 00:22:23,138
You're kidding? What else would you be
doing with her all these years?

352
00:22:23,138 --> 00:22:24,348
Talking.

353
00:22:25,224 --> 00:22:29,228
- Talking? Am I losing my hair?
- You've still got a little up there.

354
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,439
If you want to talk, you always have
the guys at the diner.

355
00:22:32,523 --> 00:22:34,733
You don't need a girl if you want to talk.

356
00:22:34,859 --> 00:22:36,527
Eddie, you'll never change.

357
00:22:37,528 --> 00:22:41,824
Yeah, I saw it. It was in the papers
this morning, Marion. Yes, this morning.

358
00:22:43,617 --> 00:22:46,829
- You and I gonna shoot some pool?
- I haven't shot pool in ages.

359
00:22:46,954 --> 00:22:49,248
It's about time,
otherwise you lose your edge.

360
00:22:49,331 --> 00:22:52,251
- You still have the morning paper?
- Mom, what's for breakfast?

361
00:22:52,251 --> 00:22:53,919
The kitchen is closed.

362
00:22:54,336 --> 00:22:55,754
I'm hungry here.

363
00:22:56,547 --> 00:23:00,134
You want something to eat? Make it.
I don't have all day to wait on you.

364
00:23:00,134 --> 00:23:04,054
Come on, Ma. Don't give me that shit.
A fried baloney sandwich would be good.

365
00:23:04,138 --> 00:23:06,432
Get out of the house.
Billy, take him out of here.

366
00:23:06,432 --> 00:23:08,851
A fried baloney sandwich isn't
a lot to ask for!

367
00:23:08,934 --> 00:23:10,936
Hold the wire, Marion, will you?

368
00:23:11,937 --> 00:23:14,440
You're giving me a headache. Take a walk.

369
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:17,526
What are you going to do?
You going to stab me?

370
00:23:18,027 --> 00:23:19,028
Come on.

371
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:23,532
You miserable creature.

372
00:23:24,158 --> 00:23:27,036
- How did you get to be such a thing?
- Take your best shot.

373
00:23:27,036 --> 00:23:30,956
- Who do you think you are?
- And then I'm gonna punch your lights out.

374
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,833
You don't even look like me.

375
00:23:34,251 --> 00:23:37,755
Where'd you come from? Get married
and get out of this house. Quick!

376
00:23:37,755 --> 00:23:41,258
Come on, go for the gut.
Then you, you're going down and out.

377
00:23:41,425 --> 00:23:43,719
Come on, I've got fists of granite.

378
00:23:43,719 --> 00:23:47,431
- How did you turn into such a thing?
- I won't look. Hit me right here.

379
00:23:47,556 --> 00:23:49,850
And ruin my good knife on you?
It's not worth it.

380
00:23:49,934 --> 00:23:52,853
Sit down. I'll fix you something to eat,
and that's it.

381
00:23:53,354 --> 00:23:55,731
Eat a sandwich, then give me some peace.

382
00:23:56,357 --> 00:23:58,234
- Billy, you want something?
- No, thanks.

383
00:23:58,234 --> 00:24:01,153
- You sure? It's no trouble.
- No, really, I'm fine.

384
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:03,322
A lot's changed around here.

385
00:24:04,823 --> 00:24:06,825
I'm never going to get married.

386
00:24:07,243 --> 00:24:09,328
Never, never.

387
00:24:10,538 --> 00:24:12,122
Aren't you, my Jo?

388
00:24:12,623 --> 00:24:15,543
Is this show in color
or is something wrong with this set?

389
00:24:15,626 --> 00:24:19,547
No, there's nothing wrong with the set.
This is a black-and-white set.

390
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:23,050
I don't think they're showing
the movie in color anyway.

391
00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:25,052
I don't like color television.

392
00:24:25,636 --> 00:24:27,930
Don't like color for nothing.

393
00:24:29,223 --> 00:24:33,727
I saw Bonanza over at my in-laws,
and it was not for me.

394
00:24:34,353 --> 00:24:36,230
The Ponderosa looked faked.

395
00:24:37,857 --> 00:24:39,859
I hardly recognized Little Joe.

396
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:41,819
Maybe you had to tune it.

397
00:24:41,944 --> 00:24:45,030
Not for me. Have you got an Emerson?
I hear they're real good.

398
00:24:45,155 --> 00:24:48,659
Yeah. I've got an Emerson right here.
It's a good set.

399
00:24:49,034 --> 00:24:52,538
- What's all that stuff?
- This? You've got a high-fidelity system.

400
00:24:52,621 --> 00:24:55,541
I don't want any high-fidelity system
with my television.

401
00:24:55,624 --> 00:24:59,920
All I want is a 21-inch Emerson,
cabinet style.

402
00:25:01,422 --> 00:25:06,218
Kenny, have we got any Emersons,
21 inches, without the record player in it?

403
00:25:07,219 --> 00:25:10,848
- I'll check in the warehouse.
- He's going to check that in the warehouse.

404
00:25:10,848 --> 00:25:13,350
It'll take a few minutes.
Why don't you look around?

405
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:16,228
I'll look around
at some of the television sets.

406
00:25:16,353 --> 00:25:17,646
You do that.

407
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:24,320
I talked to Boog.
He's taking Carol to the Strand tonight.

408
00:25:24,445 --> 00:25:25,654
The Strand?

409
00:25:26,447 --> 00:25:29,033
- He's going to try it in the Strand?
- Yeah.

410
00:25:29,533 --> 00:25:30,826
What do you want to do?

411
00:25:30,951 --> 00:25:32,745
I'll be there. A few seats away.

412
00:25:32,745 --> 00:25:36,248
Yeah, I'll be there too.
I got $20 on this thing.

413
00:25:36,749 --> 00:25:38,250
Don't want any judgement calls.

414
00:25:38,334 --> 00:25:40,753
He has a couple of C's
riding on this already.

415
00:25:40,753 --> 00:25:42,630
He's making bets left and right.

416
00:25:42,755 --> 00:25:44,423
He has $200 on this already?

417
00:25:44,548 --> 00:25:47,134
Yeah. A lot of people bet for Carol.

418
00:25:52,348 --> 00:25:54,850
What have you been doin'?
You been drinking already?

419
00:25:54,850 --> 00:25:56,560
Yeah. I guess so.

420
00:25:57,353 --> 00:25:58,854
What for? It's too early.

421
00:25:58,938 --> 00:26:03,150
I don't know. I'm getting antsy
or something. I can't figure out what.

422
00:26:03,234 --> 00:26:05,319
I'll see you at the Strand tonight.

423
00:26:08,447 --> 00:26:09,657
Hey, Fen.

424
00:26:13,619 --> 00:26:15,538
Are you sure you're all right?

425
00:26:15,538 --> 00:26:16,539
Yeah.

426
00:26:24,421 --> 00:26:26,423
What do you say, Knocko?

427
00:26:26,549 --> 00:26:27,758
Hey, Billy.

428
00:26:27,758 --> 00:26:30,261
- How're you doing?
- Eat, sleep, you know.

429
00:26:30,636 --> 00:26:32,638
I never see you and the guys anymore.

430
00:26:32,721 --> 00:26:35,140
You know how it is.
Time to move on, I guess.

431
00:26:35,224 --> 00:26:37,434
You got change for a quarter?

432
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:40,145
- Doin' okay, Billy?
- I'm going for my master's.

433
00:26:40,521 --> 00:26:42,022
Hey, wonderful.

434
00:26:42,231 --> 00:26:44,650
Take seven. It's got a new felt.

435
00:26:46,735 --> 00:26:48,153
What are you doin' it for?

436
00:26:48,153 --> 00:26:51,031
It's not like I'm doin' it
just to make her happy.

437
00:26:51,323 --> 00:26:52,825
To hell with that.

438
00:26:53,826 --> 00:26:56,245
No, you wouldn't want to make her happy.

439
00:26:56,829 --> 00:27:00,040
Anyway, she's the only one
I really care about.

440
00:27:00,541 --> 00:27:04,628
It's not like I go looking for girls to date,
or anything like that.

441
00:27:05,045 --> 00:27:07,756
It seems like the right time and all.

442
00:27:08,632 --> 00:27:10,426
At least she's not a ballbreaker.

443
00:27:10,551 --> 00:27:14,346
Christ. If she was a ballbreaker,
there'd be no way.

444
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:17,057
Right?

445
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:21,145
How you doin'?

446
00:27:21,228 --> 00:27:24,940
"It's one thing to wear your dog collar,
but when it turns into a noose...

447
00:27:25,024 --> 00:27:28,360
"...l'd rather have my freedom.
A man in jail is always for freedom.

448
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:31,655
"Except, if you'll excuse me, J.J.,
I'm not in jail.

449
00:27:31,739 --> 00:27:34,325
"You're blind, Mr. McGoo.
This is the crossroad for me.

450
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:37,620
"I won't get Kello. Not for a lifetime pass
to the polo grounds.

451
00:27:37,745 --> 00:27:40,539
"Not if you serve me Cleopatra on a plate.

452
00:27:40,623 --> 00:27:43,042
"And that is why you put your hands
on my sister.

453
00:27:43,042 --> 00:27:44,835
"J.J., please. Susie tried to..."

454
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:48,631
It's Methan's favorite movie,
The Sweet Smell of Success.

455
00:27:48,923 --> 00:27:51,133
- He memorized the whole movie?
- Yeah.

456
00:27:51,425 --> 00:27:55,137
These younger guys, I tell ya,
they're crazier than we were.

457
00:27:55,429 --> 00:27:57,932
Eddie, are you taking
any of Boogie's action?

458
00:27:58,057 --> 00:28:00,434
Yeah. No way he pulls this off.

459
00:28:06,232 --> 00:28:08,859
There's a boy up there watching me.

460
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:28,546
There he goes. Funny feeling,
being looked at without knowing it.

461
00:28:55,447 --> 00:28:56,323
What?

462
00:29:07,126 --> 00:29:08,544
Pants off.

463
00:29:45,956 --> 00:29:47,833
The rose's thorn scratched you.

464
00:29:48,125 --> 00:29:49,543
It's nothing.

465
00:29:51,462 --> 00:29:53,631
Did you ever catch fireflies?

466
00:29:53,756 --> 00:29:56,342
When I was young,
I used to put them in a bottle...

467
00:29:56,425 --> 00:29:59,053
...and see if I could get enough to read by.

468
00:29:59,136 --> 00:30:01,138
There used to be goldfish here.

469
00:30:01,222 --> 00:30:04,433
- Did you ever catch any?
- No. I wasn't supposed to.

470
00:30:04,558 --> 00:30:08,354
Last winter, we forgot to take them out
and they all froze solid.

471
00:30:10,856 --> 00:30:13,859
That poor cupid.
He looks lost without them.

472
00:30:14,235 --> 00:30:17,154
He looks like he's waiting to be kissed.

473
00:30:18,948 --> 00:30:20,032
He is.

474
00:30:22,034 --> 00:30:23,536
How can you tell?

475
00:30:24,537 --> 00:30:26,330
Well, I can't really.

476
00:30:27,248 --> 00:30:29,250
Ljust know how he feels.

477
00:30:40,553 --> 00:30:42,346
Shrevie, what's going on?

478
00:30:42,721 --> 00:30:44,056
I have no idea.

479
00:30:45,933 --> 00:30:47,643
Would you hold on a second?

480
00:30:47,726 --> 00:30:48,853
You're disgusting.

481
00:30:48,936 --> 00:30:53,440
I know it was really terrible.
It was horrible, but it was an accident.

482
00:30:53,858 --> 00:30:54,942
An accident?

483
00:30:55,359 --> 00:30:58,654
No, Carol, seriously. It was an accident.
I swear to God.

484
00:30:59,238 --> 00:31:02,825
An accident. Your thing just got
into a box of popcorn.

485
00:31:06,662 --> 00:31:08,455
Well, damn near that.

486
00:31:10,749 --> 00:31:12,751
Listen, can I be straight with you?

487
00:31:12,835 --> 00:31:15,462
Wait, look. There's a real good reason...

488
00:31:15,754 --> 00:31:19,550
...but it's a little embarrassing to me.

489
00:31:20,342 --> 00:31:23,846
So maybe if you don't want to hear it,
I'll understand.

490
00:31:24,138 --> 00:31:26,348
Go on. I want to hear this.

491
00:31:28,934 --> 00:31:30,728
I don't know, it's just...

492
00:31:31,437 --> 00:31:35,733
I don't like to tell this to girls,
but you really are a knockout.

493
00:31:36,442 --> 00:31:40,154
No, you really are. And sitting down
next to you in there got me crazy.

494
00:31:40,237 --> 00:31:41,739
I got a hard on.

495
00:31:42,448 --> 00:31:45,659
I don't like to admit it, but I did.

496
00:31:45,743 --> 00:31:50,331
I mean, you don't know me. I try
to come off like I'm being cool all the time.

497
00:31:51,123 --> 00:31:55,461
I don't like to look like I'm hustling,
and there I was next to you with a boner.

498
00:31:57,630 --> 00:31:59,256
Am I embarrassing you?

499
00:32:00,549 --> 00:32:01,550
Go on.

500
00:32:02,843 --> 00:32:05,763
I don't know, it's just that
the pain was killing me.

501
00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:09,558
It was to stop the pain.
It was digging into the side of my leg.

502
00:32:09,642 --> 00:32:13,354
So what I did was,
I opened my fly to loosen everything up.

503
00:32:13,562 --> 00:32:15,731
Just to give it a little air.

504
00:32:15,856 --> 00:32:17,149
And it worked.

505
00:32:17,441 --> 00:32:21,654
Everything settled down and then I got
caught back up in the picture.

506
00:32:21,737 --> 00:32:25,241
And then, when Sandra got her leg caught
on the bush...

507
00:32:25,324 --> 00:32:28,452
...and she lifted up her dress.
It just popped right up.

508
00:32:28,536 --> 00:32:31,163
And it went through the bottom
of the popcorn box.

509
00:32:31,247 --> 00:32:34,124
And the force of it just opened up the flap.

510
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:37,044
It just pushed the flap open?

511
00:32:37,545 --> 00:32:40,256
It's Ripley's.
It just pushed the flap right open.

512
00:32:40,339 --> 00:32:44,260
And I couldn't move the box.
You would have seen it.

513
00:32:46,428 --> 00:32:47,847
That's true.

514
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,144
Let's go back inside.

515
00:32:55,062 --> 00:32:56,438
- Okay?
- Okay.

516
00:32:56,939 --> 00:32:58,148
Come on.

517
00:32:58,649 --> 00:32:59,733
All right.

518
00:33:02,528 --> 00:33:04,947
We'll just get a seat in the back here.

519
00:33:05,739 --> 00:33:09,660
Do you care if I kiss you right here
in front of God and everybody?

520
00:33:09,952 --> 00:33:11,662
I can't wait either.

521
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:18,836
What's that guy's name? The actor?

522
00:33:19,253 --> 00:33:20,629
Troy Donahue.

523
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:23,632
Troy. What kind of name is Troy?

524
00:33:24,133 --> 00:33:25,551
He's gorgeous.

525
00:33:25,759 --> 00:33:28,637
You ever hear of a guy
with the name of Troy?

526
00:33:28,929 --> 00:33:31,223
Yeah. Troy Swartzman from Towanda.

527
00:33:31,348 --> 00:33:35,144
This movie was written by the author
of The Man in the Grey Flannel Suit.

528
00:33:35,227 --> 00:33:37,354
I wonder where that Barbara girl
and Billy are?

529
00:33:37,438 --> 00:33:39,356
I'd really like to see this again.

530
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,150
You can take Elyse.

531
00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:42,443
Hi.

532
00:33:44,737 --> 00:33:47,948
Fellas, don't forget to bring
some tens tonight.

533
00:33:48,824 --> 00:33:50,034
Ten whats?

534
00:33:50,451 --> 00:33:51,452
I don't know.

535
00:33:51,535 --> 00:33:54,955
Death. I'd give up your life
if I could have her.

536
00:34:15,226 --> 00:34:16,435
We're even.

537
00:34:17,436 --> 00:34:18,854
Take it easy.

538
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:20,856
Is he okay?

539
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:23,025
Damn. That's Willard Broxton.

540
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:26,654
Long time comin', huh, Bill?

541
00:34:26,654 --> 00:34:30,324
I couldn't believe it. There he was.
I didn't want to hit him, but I had to.

542
00:34:30,449 --> 00:34:33,160
Definitely. You had to.
I mean, Willard Broxton.

543
00:34:33,244 --> 00:34:34,537
Who's Willard Broxton?

544
00:34:34,537 --> 00:34:36,455
You should have said something.

545
00:34:36,539 --> 00:34:39,124
- What am I gonna say?
- I got Willard!

546
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:44,046
- Shrevie, who is Willard Broxton?
- I always liked Willard Broxton.

547
00:34:44,129 --> 00:34:46,257
- You liked him?
- I used to take his milk money.

548
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:48,759
That was outstanding.
I'll see you guys later.

549
00:34:48,843 --> 00:34:50,845
- Are we going to go eat?
- I'm not in the mood.

550
00:34:50,928 --> 00:34:51,846
Going to the diner?

551
00:34:51,929 --> 00:34:54,431
Later. I'm going to the TV station
to see Barbara.

552
00:34:54,849 --> 00:34:57,226
Shrevie, who is Willard Broxton?

553
00:34:58,352 --> 00:35:02,565
It was the 11th grade.
No, it was the 10th grade. That's right.

554
00:35:03,065 --> 00:35:06,443
Billy was playin' ball against
one of the high school fraternities.

555
00:35:06,527 --> 00:35:08,445
I think they were ULP.

556
00:35:08,654 --> 00:35:12,658
So Billy comes sliding into second base
to break up the double play...

557
00:35:12,741 --> 00:35:16,328
...and the second baseman thought
that Billy was trying to hurt him.

558
00:35:16,537 --> 00:35:19,832
So he jumped on Billy.
So Billy punched the guy.

559
00:35:19,957 --> 00:35:23,043
And then, the whole ULP team
jumped on Billy.

560
00:35:23,252 --> 00:35:24,837
They beat the crap out of him.

561
00:35:24,962 --> 00:35:27,548
He's been waiting for them
after all these years?

562
00:35:27,631 --> 00:35:31,051
- He swore he'd get them.
- That was forever ago, Shrevie.

563
00:35:31,552 --> 00:35:35,931
So, Broxton makes it eight. Or seven.
Seven? No, no. It's eight. That's right.

564
00:35:36,056 --> 00:35:37,850
There's one guy left.

565
00:35:38,350 --> 00:35:41,061
What are you waitin' for? It's open.

566
00:35:45,941 --> 00:35:49,236
What about the slides?
I didn't hear anything about the slides.

567
00:35:49,361 --> 00:35:53,240
- There's not much time before the news.
- Yeah, I tried to call.

568
00:35:53,657 --> 00:35:56,327
The switchboard closes down at 10:00.

569
00:35:58,245 --> 00:36:01,165
I was just getting the feeling
that you were avoiding me.

570
00:36:01,248 --> 00:36:03,125
That's not true, Billy.

571
00:36:19,642 --> 00:36:22,228
Do you want to run down
the film chains for me?

572
00:36:22,353 --> 00:36:25,356
The governor's press conference on 3.
There's a B roll of it.

573
00:36:25,356 --> 00:36:27,149
And the slides? One.

574
00:36:36,450 --> 00:36:37,826
Stand by for cold tease.

575
00:36:37,952 --> 00:36:39,245
Ten seconds.

576
00:36:40,037 --> 00:36:43,332
- Who's the visitor?
- Friend of mine. Five seconds.

577
00:36:44,834 --> 00:36:46,335
And, one. Mike, cue!

578
00:36:46,544 --> 00:36:49,338
President Eisenhower returns
from the World Peace Tour.

579
00:36:49,463 --> 00:36:53,843
Steel dispute continues. Interviews
with John Unitas and coach Ewbank...

580
00:36:54,134 --> 00:36:56,846
...in preparation for tomorrow's
championship game.

581
00:36:56,846 --> 00:36:59,056
These and other stories next.

582
00:36:59,139 --> 00:37:00,933
Roll three, three and track.

583
00:37:01,058 --> 00:37:04,436
Willy, after this I still have
a lot of work to do.

584
00:37:04,728 --> 00:37:06,647
Why don't you call in the morning?

585
00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:08,732
- Where's the news opening?
- Six.

586
00:37:09,441 --> 00:37:11,151
Okay. What's good?

587
00:37:12,027 --> 00:37:14,864
Church services are at 10:00, 8:30, 9:00.

588
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,325
Punch I.D., and announce.

589
00:37:19,535 --> 00:37:23,664
This is WBAL TV, Channel 11
in Baltimore, wishing all our viewers...

590
00:37:23,831 --> 00:37:26,750
...a Merry Christmas
and a Happy New Year.

591
00:37:56,155 --> 00:37:58,949
Let's see. It's two more days till the test.

592
00:37:59,366 --> 00:38:03,746
And if she passes, it's two more days
till the thing. The marriage.

593
00:38:04,455 --> 00:38:06,540
Where are you guys going, Puerto Rico?

594
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:07,750
No, Cuba.

595
00:38:07,833 --> 00:38:12,129
Cuba, that's nice. My parent's friends,
the Copelands, they go there every year.

596
00:38:12,254 --> 00:38:14,256
- They said it's nice?
- Really nice.

597
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:15,633
Yeah, I heard.

598
00:38:19,053 --> 00:38:21,931
Shrev, are you happy
with your marriage or what?

599
00:38:23,766 --> 00:38:25,142
I don't know.

600
00:38:25,226 --> 00:38:27,728
What do you mean, you don't know?

601
00:38:27,937 --> 00:38:30,147
- You don't know?
- What?

602
00:38:30,231 --> 00:38:33,526
How could you not... You don't know?
How could you not know?

603
00:38:33,526 --> 00:38:34,944
I don't know.

604
00:38:36,529 --> 00:38:40,366
Beth is terrific and everything,
but Jesus, I don't know.

605
00:38:42,826 --> 00:38:45,663
A big part of the problem
when you get married...

606
00:38:45,746 --> 00:38:47,540
When you're dating...

607
00:38:48,332 --> 00:38:50,751
...everything is talkin' about sex, right?

608
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,754
Where can we do it? Why can't we do it?

609
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:57,967
Are your parents going to be out
so we can do it?

610
00:38:58,926 --> 00:39:01,637
Trying to get a weekend
just so that we can do it.

611
00:39:01,637 --> 00:39:02,763
So you can do it.

612
00:39:02,847 --> 00:39:06,058
Everything is just always talkin'
about getting sex.

613
00:39:06,267 --> 00:39:08,561
And then planning the wedding.

614
00:39:09,144 --> 00:39:10,563
All the details.

615
00:39:11,355 --> 00:39:12,731
Details, shit.

616
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:15,943
But then, when you get married...

617
00:39:17,945 --> 00:39:21,365
It's crazy, I don't know.
You can get it whenever you want it.

618
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:23,868
You wake up in the morning,
and she's there.

619
00:39:23,951 --> 00:39:27,037
And you come home from work,
and she's there.

620
00:39:27,329 --> 00:39:30,541
And so all that sex-planning talk
is over with.

621
00:39:31,458 --> 00:39:34,962
And so is the wedding-planning talk
'cause you're already married.

622
00:39:37,464 --> 00:39:42,344
So, you know, I can come down here
and we can bullshit the whole night away.

623
00:39:42,428 --> 00:39:45,764
But I cannot hold
a five-minute conversation with Beth.

624
00:39:46,348 --> 00:39:48,350
It's not her fault. I'm not blaming her.

625
00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:50,936
- She's great. It's...
- No, of course not.

626
00:39:52,229 --> 00:39:54,732
It's just, we've got nothing to talk about.

627
00:39:57,735 --> 00:39:59,653
But, it's good, it's good.

628
00:39:59,737 --> 00:40:01,030
It's good?

629
00:40:01,947 --> 00:40:03,741
- It's nice, right?
- Yes.

630
00:40:04,033 --> 00:40:05,451
- It's nice.
- Right.

631
00:40:09,538 --> 00:40:12,333
Well, you've always got the diner.

632
00:40:14,335 --> 00:40:16,962
Yeah. We've always got the diner.

633
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,050
Don't worry about it.

634
00:40:21,133 --> 00:40:22,635
I'm not worried.

635
00:40:23,844 --> 00:40:25,137
Don't back out on me.

636
00:40:25,137 --> 00:40:27,640
I'm not going to back out on you, either.

637
00:40:28,557 --> 00:40:31,936
Unless, of course, she fails the test.
It's out of my hands.

638
00:40:53,541 --> 00:40:57,044
Hey, Boog. Did you hear? They won by 14.

639
00:40:57,336 --> 00:41:00,631
God! They weren't supposed to roll up
that high of a score!

640
00:41:00,756 --> 00:41:03,259
You gonna listen to me next time?

641
00:41:54,351 --> 00:41:56,854
Come here. Your mother
let you loose like this?

642
00:41:56,937 --> 00:41:59,064
Look at those pants.
I got charcoal pants here.

643
00:41:59,148 --> 00:42:00,941
You want to get inside the diner?

644
00:42:01,066 --> 00:42:03,569
Come here. Look at these. Charcoal gray.

645
00:42:04,445 --> 00:42:06,238
Special sale, $12.50.

646
00:42:06,238 --> 00:42:10,034
- $12.50? You offered him $7.
- For you, $11.98. These are better.

647
00:42:10,159 --> 00:42:13,662
You think I'll tell him?
Don't tell anyone where you got these.

648
00:42:13,746 --> 00:42:16,165
- How much money have you got?
- $4.

649
00:42:16,248 --> 00:42:19,168
$4? I've got a good shirt for you.
Forget the pants.

650
00:42:21,962 --> 00:42:23,839
- It's incredible.
- Unbelievable.

651
00:42:23,964 --> 00:42:25,466
Where's he now?

652
00:42:25,633 --> 00:42:29,261
He's already up to the Pimlico. Right?
Then he's got the Junction.

653
00:42:29,261 --> 00:42:32,848
And the Avalon and the Garrison.
That's the George's Deluxe in the corner.

654
00:42:32,932 --> 00:42:34,266
Oh, yeah.

655
00:42:34,642 --> 00:42:36,060
You know what that is?

656
00:42:36,143 --> 00:42:40,731
One, two. The whole left side of the menu.
What a triumph if he pulls it off.

657
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:44,652
You're talking about 15, 16 more
if you include the...

658
00:42:44,735 --> 00:42:46,529
...the Maryland fried-chicken dinner.

659
00:42:46,529 --> 00:42:49,448
No. I think he's just talking
club sandwiches.

660
00:42:49,532 --> 00:42:52,451
Excuse me, Earl. Does that include
the fried-chicken dinner?

661
00:42:52,535 --> 00:42:53,869
- Yes.
- It does.

662
00:42:54,954 --> 00:42:58,666
Twenty-two deluxe sandwiches
and the fried-chicken dinner!

663
00:42:58,666 --> 00:43:02,169
It's not human. He's not a person.
He's like a building with feet.

664
00:43:02,253 --> 00:43:04,338
You know what I mean? It's unbelievable.

665
00:43:04,463 --> 00:43:05,548
I won't pay you.

666
00:43:05,631 --> 00:43:06,549
It's not fair.

667
00:43:06,549 --> 00:43:10,553
She was supposed to grab your pecker,
not reach into the popcorn and get it.

668
00:43:10,553 --> 00:43:12,638
- Exactly.
- She grabbed my pecker.

669
00:43:12,638 --> 00:43:16,350
Boog, the bet was to touch your pecker,
not pecker in popcorn.

670
00:43:16,433 --> 00:43:19,436
That's right. It was pecker-touching
without intention.

671
00:43:20,062 --> 00:43:23,858
I'm not going to pay you.
No, she was supposed to grab your pecker.

672
00:43:24,567 --> 00:43:26,443
- Give me some money.
- I don't buy it.

673
00:43:26,569 --> 00:43:29,947
Yeah. I want it on the up-and-up.
Me too. This one was default.

674
00:43:30,030 --> 00:43:31,866
Let it ride. I'll tell you what.

675
00:43:31,866 --> 00:43:34,952
I'll bet you that I can ball Carol Heathrow
on our next date.

676
00:43:35,035 --> 00:43:36,161
Now, you're nuts.

677
00:43:36,161 --> 00:43:37,746
- No.
- Come on, Boog.

678
00:43:37,830 --> 00:43:40,249
You want to bet me $50 a guy?

679
00:43:40,332 --> 00:43:41,250
$50?

680
00:43:42,251 --> 00:43:44,628
It's like stealing money from you, Boog.

681
00:43:45,129 --> 00:43:47,965
- Are you in?
- Yeah, I'm in. I'm in.

682
00:43:48,340 --> 00:43:49,633
- Are you in?
- I'm in.

683
00:43:49,758 --> 00:43:51,051
- Are you in?
- I'm in.

684
00:43:51,135 --> 00:43:52,261
All right.

685
00:43:53,429 --> 00:43:55,139
Are you in, Billy?

686
00:43:55,764 --> 00:43:57,266
No, I'm not in.

687
00:43:57,850 --> 00:43:59,935
I'll take all the action I can get.

688
00:44:00,853 --> 00:44:02,438
We need validation.

689
00:44:02,563 --> 00:44:06,233
All right, you want validation?
Okay, you can be there to validate.

690
00:44:06,233 --> 00:44:07,234
Sure.

691
00:44:16,744 --> 00:44:19,038
- Earl is the king.
- The whole left side.

692
00:44:19,455 --> 00:44:22,458
The Portland. I didn't think he could eat
any more than that.

693
00:44:22,541 --> 00:44:25,252
Do you want to look at some desserts?
He's locking up.

694
00:44:25,336 --> 00:44:26,754
Get 'em now or forget it.

695
00:44:26,837 --> 00:44:29,840
- Can he do it?
- Yes. He's getting in the car.

696
00:44:31,467 --> 00:44:32,968
Good breakfast, Earl.

697
00:44:33,344 --> 00:44:38,140
- Try to keep it down, Earl.
- Standing ovation for the Earl. Standing O.

698
00:44:38,265 --> 00:44:39,642
The car moves.

699
00:44:40,434 --> 00:44:42,269
Don't get in the way.

700
00:44:42,561 --> 00:44:44,939
That was beautiful. Grind 'em.

701
00:44:45,731 --> 00:44:47,858
Peel some rubber now, Earl.

702
00:44:48,234 --> 00:44:51,070
Let's meet here at 12:00
and go to the game in my car.

703
00:44:51,153 --> 00:44:54,240
Let's make it quarter to.
I don't want to miss any pre-game crap.

704
00:44:54,365 --> 00:44:57,451
Why don't we just go now?
That way we won't miss anything.

705
00:44:57,535 --> 00:45:00,829
Shrevie! Wait a minute, we're talkin'
about the championship game.

706
00:45:00,829 --> 00:45:03,832
For Christ's sake, let's get serious.
A quarter to.

707
00:45:04,834 --> 00:45:07,253
- All right. I'll see you later.
- So long.

708
00:45:09,129 --> 00:45:10,256
You got a ride?

709
00:45:10,256 --> 00:45:12,132
- You going straight home?
- Yeah. Get in.

710
00:45:12,258 --> 00:45:15,261
- It's no problem?
- Modell! Don't give me that. Get in.

711
00:45:15,344 --> 00:45:18,556
You want me to go? I'll go.
Whatever you want.

712
00:46:00,639 --> 00:46:02,933
I have to meet that girl. She is death.

713
00:46:06,145 --> 00:46:08,230
- Very nice.
- Man, I'm in love.

714
00:46:08,939 --> 00:46:11,442
Miss! Whoa, miss!

715
00:46:15,446 --> 00:46:17,239
- Hey, miss!
- Watch the road.

716
00:46:24,038 --> 00:46:25,664
Hold on a second.

717
00:46:40,137 --> 00:46:41,847
I was admiring your horse.

718
00:46:42,932 --> 00:46:43,849
Were you?

719
00:46:45,059 --> 00:46:47,269
Do you ride Western as well?

720
00:46:47,561 --> 00:46:51,065
I do, but I prefer English.
There's a finer sense of control.

721
00:46:53,359 --> 00:46:54,652
What's your name?

722
00:46:54,735 --> 00:46:57,571
Jane Chisholm. As in the Chisholm Trail.

723
00:47:02,660 --> 00:47:04,745
What fucking Chisholm Trail?

724
00:47:05,955 --> 00:47:10,042
Do you ever get the feeling there's
something going on we don't know about?

725
00:47:15,756 --> 00:47:19,260
Do you get the feeling
that she gave me a fake name?

726
00:47:31,355 --> 00:47:34,859
- Do you want to keep driving?
- Might as well call it a night.

727
00:48:21,864 --> 00:48:23,949
Is there anything wrong, Barb?

728
00:48:24,658 --> 00:48:25,451
No.

729
00:48:28,662 --> 00:48:30,831
Yes. I think I'm pregnant.

730
00:48:44,261 --> 00:48:45,137
Me?

731
00:48:47,348 --> 00:48:48,349
Yes.

732
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:54,647
Our one night in New York last month.

733
00:48:56,649 --> 00:49:00,569
Six years of a platonic relationship,
and then that night.

734
00:49:01,946 --> 00:49:03,239
And this happens.

735
00:49:06,450 --> 00:49:08,369
- Maybe it's for the best.
- No.

736
00:49:10,371 --> 00:49:11,163
I don't think so.

737
00:49:14,458 --> 00:49:16,168
Do you want to marry me?

738
00:49:17,753 --> 00:49:18,671
Yes.

739
00:49:19,964 --> 00:49:23,634
Is that why you came back
a few days early? To ask?

740
00:49:25,469 --> 00:49:28,347
Well, I thought after New York,
you know...

741
00:49:30,266 --> 00:49:32,434
Seven weeks is a long time
when you miss someone.

742
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:34,270
New York was a mistake.

743
00:49:36,856 --> 00:49:41,861
Maybe it wasn't as romantic as we'd like it
to be, but I think it will happen.

744
00:49:44,446 --> 00:49:46,240
It isn't perfect yet, but...

745
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:51,662
I love you, Barb.

746
00:49:54,665 --> 00:49:59,044
You're confusing a friendship
with a woman and love.

747
00:50:00,546 --> 00:50:01,964
It's not the same.

748
00:50:07,845 --> 00:50:10,347
That's the opening whistle
and our game begins.

749
00:50:10,347 --> 00:50:13,142
You're still playing
for a 30-point bonus question.

750
00:50:13,142 --> 00:50:16,437
Here's another toss up in English.
Are you ready?

751
00:50:16,937 --> 00:50:21,859
A spaceship is stranded on the planet
Mercury outside of the libration areas.

752
00:50:22,359 --> 00:50:25,070
It is night, and pitch black outside.

753
00:50:25,362 --> 00:50:29,533
For 10 points, how long must the explorers
wait until sunrise?

754
00:50:29,658 --> 00:50:31,452
Sun doesn't rise on Mercury.

755
00:50:31,535 --> 00:50:32,953
Bryn Mawr. Stebbins.

756
00:50:33,037 --> 00:50:35,539
They won't get a sunrise
because Mercury has one side...

757
00:50:35,664 --> 00:50:38,459
...perpetually turned toward the Sun
and the other away from it.

758
00:50:38,542 --> 00:50:42,254
That's right. They would have
to wait forever. That's the answer.

759
00:50:42,338 --> 00:50:44,256
I have a 20-point bonus coming up.

760
00:50:44,256 --> 00:50:49,136
Here's your toss-up. For 10 points:
What would a man probably have...

761
00:50:49,553 --> 00:50:53,641
...if he had a visible contusion
near the upper part of his zygomatic arch?

762
00:50:54,058 --> 00:50:55,059
A black eye.

763
00:50:55,351 --> 00:50:56,852
A sharp lump on his head.

764
00:50:56,852 --> 00:50:58,354
Black eye, you bozo.

765
00:50:58,771 --> 00:50:59,939
Bryn Mawr. Stebbins.

766
00:51:00,064 --> 00:51:03,651
I think, let's see, he would have
a bump here.

767
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:06,654
You look like you've got a bump
on your head.

768
00:51:06,737 --> 00:51:07,863
A black eye.

769
00:51:08,239 --> 00:51:10,866
All right. We were looking for a black eye.

770
00:51:11,158 --> 00:51:13,536
But I must accept a bruised cheekbone.

771
00:51:16,956 --> 00:51:21,252
Yeah, Ma. I know I owe $2,000.
Guess what? I heard it before you.

772
00:51:22,336 --> 00:51:24,046
What am I gonna do?

773
00:51:24,755 --> 00:51:28,467
I'm choice. I'm gonna have to find
a way to pay it off.

774
00:51:28,634 --> 00:51:30,845
Me? I've got $56 to my name.

775
00:51:32,471 --> 00:51:34,640
Yeah, I know I'm in trouble.

776
00:51:34,765 --> 00:51:37,852
Then they'll kill me. What can I tell you?

777
00:51:38,769 --> 00:51:42,857
Here's your toss-up. For 10 points:
What home-grown philosopher said:

778
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:45,568
- "The masks of men lead lives..."
- Thoreau!

779
00:51:45,651 --> 00:51:47,152
- Cornell. Pearlman.
- Thoreau.

780
00:51:47,236 --> 00:51:49,947
Right, for 10 points. "Lead lives of quiet..."

781
00:51:59,748 --> 00:52:01,250
That's right, for 10 points.

782
00:52:01,250 --> 00:52:03,752
The statement inscribed
in the US Post Office:

783
00:52:03,836 --> 00:52:06,338
"Neither snow, nor rain, nor heat,
nor gloom of night..."

784
00:52:06,338 --> 00:52:07,464
Herodotus!

785
00:52:08,841 --> 00:52:11,343
For 10 points, what classical author
wrote it?

786
00:52:11,343 --> 00:52:13,762
- Herodotus.
- Right, for 10 points.

787
00:52:14,638 --> 00:52:17,641
Hey, Cornell! Take a walk, you bozo.

788
00:52:17,766 --> 00:52:20,269
...final half, with the score:
Bryn Mawr College, 104...

789
00:52:20,352 --> 00:52:22,062
...and Cornell University, 60.

790
00:52:22,146 --> 00:52:24,565
I talked to Shrevie.
He's going to lend me $200.

791
00:52:24,648 --> 00:52:26,358
- You going over now?
- Yeah.

792
00:52:27,651 --> 00:52:31,071
I might drop in on my brother,
maybe get some bucks from the toast.

793
00:52:31,155 --> 00:52:32,156
Howard?

794
00:52:33,657 --> 00:52:34,658
Really?

795
00:52:35,659 --> 00:52:37,453
I appreciate that, Fen.

796
00:52:37,536 --> 00:52:40,039
I know how you guys feel
about each other.

797
00:52:41,373 --> 00:52:45,753
Listen. With the Heathrow bet
I'm gonna be close. I'll see ya later.

798
00:53:14,073 --> 00:53:15,074
Beth?

799
00:53:17,368 --> 00:53:18,869
- What?
- Come here.

800
00:53:19,161 --> 00:53:21,163
I'm doing a crossword puzzle.

801
00:53:21,372 --> 00:53:22,540
Come here!

802
00:53:28,671 --> 00:53:29,672
What?

803
00:53:30,047 --> 00:53:32,174
Have you been playing my records?

804
00:53:32,341 --> 00:53:33,634
Yeah. So?

805
00:53:33,759 --> 00:53:35,970
So, didn't I tell you the procedure?

806
00:53:36,554 --> 00:53:40,266
You told me all about it, Shrevie.
They have to be in alphabetical order.

807
00:53:40,641 --> 00:53:42,059
And what else?

808
00:53:43,352 --> 00:53:47,356
They have to be filed alphabetically
and according to year as well. Okay?

809
00:53:48,274 --> 00:53:49,650
And what else?

810
00:53:52,361 --> 00:53:54,572
- And what else?
- I don't know.

811
00:53:55,364 --> 00:53:58,367
You don't know?
Let me give you a hint, okay?

812
00:53:58,450 --> 00:54:03,372
I found my James Brown record filed
under the J's, instead of the B's.

813
00:54:03,539 --> 00:54:05,958
I don't know who taught you
to alphabetize.

814
00:54:06,041 --> 00:54:08,836
But to top it off, he's in
the rock-and-roll section...

815
00:54:08,961 --> 00:54:12,464
...instead of the R & B section.
How can you do that?

816
00:54:12,548 --> 00:54:15,968
It's too complicated, Shrevie.
See, every time I pull out a record...

817
00:54:16,051 --> 00:54:18,846
...there's this whole procedure
I have to go through.

818
00:54:18,846 --> 00:54:21,348
I just want to hear the music, that's all.

819
00:54:21,348 --> 00:54:24,768
Is it too complicated to just keep
my records in the category?

820
00:54:24,768 --> 00:54:27,146
Just put the rock-and-roll
in with the rock-and-roll.

821
00:54:27,271 --> 00:54:30,065
Put the R & B in with the R & B.

822
00:54:31,066 --> 00:54:35,154
You're not going to put Charlie Parker
in with the rock-and-roll, would you?

823
00:54:35,946 --> 00:54:37,156
Would you?

824
00:54:37,364 --> 00:54:40,075
I don't know. Who is Charlie Parker?

825
00:54:42,161 --> 00:54:44,038
Jazz! Jazz!

826
00:54:44,455 --> 00:54:47,958
He was the greatest jazz saxophone player
that ever lived!

827
00:54:49,043 --> 00:54:50,961
What are you getting so crazy about?

828
00:54:51,045 --> 00:54:54,048
It's just music. It's not that big a deal.

829
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:58,469
It is. Don't you understand?
This is important to me.

830
00:55:00,346 --> 00:55:02,348
Shrevie, why do you yell at me?

831
00:55:05,142 --> 00:55:07,561
I never hear you yell at any of your friends.

832
00:55:07,645 --> 00:55:09,939
Look. Pick a record. Okay?

833
00:55:10,147 --> 00:55:12,066
- What?
- Just pick any record.

834
00:55:12,358 --> 00:55:13,943
Any record. Okay.

835
00:55:14,652 --> 00:55:16,362
What's the hit side?

836
00:55:18,948 --> 00:55:20,658
Good Golly Miss Molly.

837
00:55:20,950 --> 00:55:23,369
Now, ask me what's on the flip side.

838
00:55:23,744 --> 00:55:24,662
Why?

839
00:55:25,538 --> 00:55:28,374
Just ask me what's on the flip side. Okay?

840
00:55:28,457 --> 00:55:30,042
What is on the flip side?

841
00:55:30,042 --> 00:55:34,463
Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey. 1958.
Specialty Records.

842
00:55:37,174 --> 00:55:42,137
See, you don't ask me things like that.
You never ask me what's on the flip side.

843
00:55:42,763 --> 00:55:45,266
No. Because I don't give a shit.

844
00:55:45,766 --> 00:55:48,352
Who cares about what's on the flip side
of a record?

845
00:55:48,435 --> 00:55:49,353
I do.

846
00:55:50,855 --> 00:55:53,274
Every one of my records means something.

847
00:55:54,149 --> 00:55:57,361
The label. The producer.
The year it was made.

848
00:55:57,653 --> 00:56:00,948
Who was copying whose styles.
Who was expanding on that.

849
00:56:01,073 --> 00:56:02,867
Don't you understand?

850
00:56:03,158 --> 00:56:04,952
When I listen to my records...

851
00:56:05,035 --> 00:56:08,038
...they take me back to certain points
in my life. Okay?

852
00:56:08,038 --> 00:56:10,666
Just don't touch my records. Ever.

853
00:56:13,169 --> 00:56:14,962
The first time that I met you...

854
00:56:15,045 --> 00:56:19,049
...Modell's sister's high-school
graduation party. Right? 1955.

855
00:56:19,175 --> 00:56:23,137
And Ain't That A Shame was playing
when I walked in the door.

856
00:57:03,844 --> 00:57:05,763
- Hi, Boogie.
- How're you doin'?

857
00:57:06,263 --> 00:57:07,765
- Is Shrevie here?
- No.

858
00:57:08,641 --> 00:57:12,561
He's not here? I called him
a little while ago, and he said he'd be in.

859
00:57:14,772 --> 00:57:16,357
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

860
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:19,151
- Did I come at a bad time?
- No, it's all right.

861
00:57:19,568 --> 00:57:22,446
What's the matter? Maybe I should go.
I'll come back later.

862
00:57:22,571 --> 00:57:25,241
Should I leave? Should I?
What's the matter?

863
00:57:25,449 --> 00:57:27,576
Boogie, does he ever yell at you?

864
00:57:27,660 --> 00:57:29,745
What? What happened, baby?

865
00:57:34,250 --> 00:57:35,751
We had a fight.

866
00:57:36,377 --> 00:57:38,838
- Why did you have a fight?
- I don't know.

867
00:57:43,175 --> 00:57:45,177
Do you want me to talk to him?

868
00:57:45,469 --> 00:57:48,347
- Tell me why you had a fight.
- I don't know...

869
00:57:48,472 --> 00:57:50,349
Come on, don't cry. Come on.

870
00:57:51,141 --> 00:57:53,644
- Come on, baby.
- I did something wrong.

871
00:58:29,555 --> 00:58:32,766
He's in trouble. Don't you know
about friendship, Howard?

872
00:58:33,058 --> 00:58:34,643
$500?

873
00:58:34,643 --> 00:58:38,272
$400, $300. Whatever you can afford.

874
00:58:38,772 --> 00:58:40,649
Maybe this is a lesson for you.

875
00:58:40,649 --> 00:58:43,861
If you worked, you'd have
some money to lend him.

876
00:58:44,069 --> 00:58:47,740
Yeah, I know. I'm irresponsible.
I dropped out of college.

877
00:58:47,948 --> 00:58:51,243
I won't work in the family business.
I'm a disgrace.

878
00:58:51,243 --> 00:58:55,247
That's a good reason to keep me
out of your house, God knows.

879
00:58:55,247 --> 00:58:56,457
You're a bad example.

880
00:58:56,540 --> 00:59:00,377
Far be it for me to disagree.
Give me some money, Howard.

881
00:59:01,545 --> 00:59:03,255
Do you ever read a book?

882
00:59:04,673 --> 00:59:05,674
Read.

883
00:59:05,758 --> 00:59:07,760
- Do you ever read?
- Never.

884
00:59:07,843 --> 00:59:11,263
You should read Dale Carnegie's
How to Win Friends and Influence People.

885
00:59:11,347 --> 00:59:13,140
Give me some money, Howard.

886
00:59:14,058 --> 00:59:15,643
Where'd you get this attitude?

887
00:59:15,768 --> 00:59:19,438
I borrowed it. I have to have it back
by midnight. Howard!

888
00:59:19,563 --> 00:59:22,441
I should talk to Daddy about stopping
your trust fund.

889
00:59:22,566 --> 00:59:24,443
It's killing your initiative.

890
00:59:25,444 --> 00:59:29,365
Some big trust fund.
$100 a month till I'm 23.

891
00:59:29,448 --> 00:59:31,867
Yeah, Granddad was a real Rockefeller.

892
00:59:33,160 --> 00:59:34,161
Howard.

893
00:59:35,371 --> 00:59:36,539
It's important.

894
00:59:37,164 --> 00:59:38,874
I wouldn't come otherwise.

895
00:59:39,166 --> 00:59:42,878
I don't like to see you,
so you know it's got to be very important.

896
00:59:44,255 --> 00:59:45,339
Get off.

897
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:48,551
I despise you, and yet I'm here.

898
00:59:49,677 --> 00:59:50,845
Get off.

899
00:59:57,268 --> 01:00:01,438
It's funny. You know, when I was
a little kid I always wanted a brother...

900
01:00:01,564 --> 01:00:05,150
...and I told that to Mom once.
And she said, "You have a brother."

901
01:00:05,276 --> 01:00:09,238
And I said, "Oh, that's who the asshole
in the other bed is."

902
01:00:14,451 --> 01:00:17,371
If I had my way,
I'd just date Elyse all my life.

903
01:00:17,663 --> 01:00:19,874
- Hey, watch it, pal.
- Just date her.

904
01:00:20,165 --> 01:00:21,876
I personally like dating.

905
01:00:21,876 --> 01:00:25,171
- What are you doing it for?
- I've been datin' Elyse for five years.

906
01:00:25,254 --> 01:00:28,549
I have no choice. You know how girls are.
Security and all that.

907
01:00:28,549 --> 01:00:31,177
They need that thing, that marriage thing.

908
01:00:38,851 --> 01:00:40,060
What am I watching?

909
01:00:40,144 --> 01:00:42,855
The movie just started
and I don't know what's going on.

910
01:00:42,938 --> 01:00:44,356
It's symbolic.

911
01:00:53,073 --> 01:00:54,575
Who's that guy?

912
01:00:55,743 --> 01:00:58,245
That's Death walking on the beach.

913
01:01:00,539 --> 01:01:05,169
I've been to Atlantic City 100 times
and I never saw Death walk on the beach.

914
01:01:16,347 --> 01:01:17,264
Kids.

915
01:01:18,140 --> 01:01:19,558
Kids did this.

916
01:01:28,776 --> 01:01:31,153
It's a sacrilege for Christ's sake.

917
01:01:42,456 --> 01:01:43,541
What is this?

918
01:01:43,749 --> 01:01:45,376
- Come on.
- What's wrong?

919
01:01:45,459 --> 01:01:46,460
It's an emergency.

920
01:01:46,544 --> 01:01:48,254
- What's up?
- Fenwick's in the manger.

921
01:01:48,254 --> 01:01:50,840
- What?
- He's in the manger and he won't leave.

922
01:01:51,173 --> 01:01:53,467
I've never seen him like this.

923
01:01:56,262 --> 01:02:00,474
"O little town of Bethlehem

924
01:02:01,350 --> 01:02:04,854
"How still we... lie"

925
01:02:10,442 --> 01:02:12,862
- This is crazy.
- I told you.

926
01:02:15,865 --> 01:02:18,367
Three more wise men.
They've heard of the miracle.

927
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:19,577
Let's go, Fen.

928
01:02:19,660 --> 01:02:21,871
You must have traveled far.

929
01:02:22,454 --> 01:02:25,374
Come. Come rest your weary feet.

930
01:02:26,750 --> 01:02:27,459
Come on.

931
01:02:27,543 --> 01:02:30,880
Get out of there. Someone'll spot you.
The police will be here.

932
01:02:31,046 --> 01:02:33,174
Come on, Fen. Put your pants on.

933
01:02:36,051 --> 01:02:39,847
This is a big smile. Don't you think?

934
01:02:39,972 --> 01:02:41,765
Yeah, come on.

935
01:02:42,850 --> 01:02:43,851
Come on.

936
01:02:44,351 --> 01:02:46,562
- Let's go.
- No! No!

937
01:02:46,770 --> 01:02:48,772
- Here we go.
- Fen, no! Fen!

938
01:02:48,856 --> 01:02:51,066
- Eddie, get him.
- Get his arms.

939
01:02:52,359 --> 01:02:53,861
Billy, grab him.

940
01:02:57,239 --> 01:02:59,575
- I got him.
- Keep him. Hold on.

941
01:03:04,580 --> 01:03:07,041
- Back! Back!
- Fenwick, put that sheep down.

942
01:03:07,041 --> 01:03:09,251
- Put the sheep down.
- Stop screwing around.

943
01:03:09,376 --> 01:03:12,963
Put the sheep down. We'll pick up
the three wise men and get out of here.

944
01:03:22,973 --> 01:03:23,974
Police.

945
01:03:25,142 --> 01:03:27,853
Fortunately, my work is done.

946
01:03:30,272 --> 01:03:31,941
Nice, Fen. Very nice.

947
01:03:33,275 --> 01:03:34,652
What do we do now?

948
01:03:34,860 --> 01:03:35,861
Choice.

949
01:03:37,446 --> 01:03:38,739
Thanks, pal.

950
01:03:45,663 --> 01:03:47,957
I have some killer questions for the test.

951
01:03:48,040 --> 01:03:50,042
Tomorrow night's the showdown.

952
01:03:50,251 --> 01:03:51,961
Is she studying hard?

953
01:03:53,170 --> 01:03:55,756
Better be. Otherwise,
she's off to Cuba alone.

954
01:04:02,847 --> 01:04:04,765
Wish I knew what to do about Barbara.

955
01:04:04,849 --> 01:04:07,852
You get married. You take her back
to school with ya.

956
01:04:08,060 --> 01:04:09,770
You get a part-time job.

957
01:04:09,854 --> 01:04:14,149
And by the time you've got your master's,
kid's arrived, all's well.

958
01:04:14,775 --> 01:04:16,277
What about her job?

959
01:04:17,152 --> 01:04:18,279
Her job?

960
01:04:20,447 --> 01:04:21,574
Her job...

961
01:04:22,449 --> 01:04:26,078
I give you an answer and you confuse it
by bringing her into the problem.

962
01:04:26,161 --> 01:04:27,955
Do you want to take a walk?

963
01:04:30,666 --> 01:04:32,543
Look, Ed. She's in this thing.

964
01:04:33,252 --> 01:04:35,045
There's two of us, you know.

965
01:04:35,379 --> 01:04:37,047
She loves her work and...

966
01:04:38,841 --> 01:04:41,969
...she doesn't want to marry me.
That's the bottom line.

967
01:04:42,761 --> 01:04:46,056
You're dealing with an irrational girl.
That's your problem.

968
01:04:48,267 --> 01:04:51,145
Do you want to find someplace else
to stand, buddy?

969
01:04:51,270 --> 01:04:53,772
You going to do something about it?

970
01:04:55,441 --> 01:04:57,651
You heard him! Schmuck, back off!

971
01:04:57,651 --> 01:05:00,279
You going to do something about it?

972
01:05:05,075 --> 01:05:08,662
Do you want to fight?
Is that what you want? Come on.

973
01:05:09,663 --> 01:05:11,874
Come on, you son of a bitch.

974
01:05:12,166 --> 01:05:15,544
I'll hit you so hard,
I'll kill your whole family.

975
01:05:30,059 --> 01:05:31,477
What's going on?

976
01:05:31,477 --> 01:05:32,561
What?

977
01:05:34,355 --> 01:05:35,773
I've got him right here.

978
01:05:35,773 --> 01:05:40,277
We called Timmy's father, but he said
he wouldn't post bail until the morning.

979
01:05:40,361 --> 01:05:42,780
He wants to teach him a lesson.

980
01:05:42,947 --> 01:05:45,866
We get back from Florida, open the door,
and the police call.

981
01:05:45,866 --> 01:05:47,743
That's what I call good timing.

982
01:05:47,868 --> 01:05:49,578
- How's Mom?
- She's fine.

983
01:05:55,960 --> 01:05:59,380
- He was punching out wise men?
- Yeah, he was punching out the wise men.

984
01:05:59,463 --> 01:06:01,465
He was so drunk I couldn't believe it.

985
01:06:01,465 --> 01:06:05,052
I can't believe that his father leaves him
in jail overnight.

986
01:06:05,177 --> 01:06:08,264
He's punching out the wise men
and knocks over the whole manger?

987
01:06:08,347 --> 01:06:12,768
His family situation is not the best.
Between his father and his brother...

988
01:06:12,852 --> 01:06:15,855
"But why furnish your enemies
with ammunition?

989
01:06:16,564 --> 01:06:19,358
"You're a family man, Harvey.
And someday, God willing...

990
01:06:19,358 --> 01:06:23,153
"...you may want to be president.
And there you are, out in the open...

991
01:06:23,153 --> 01:06:27,575
"...where any hep person knows that
this guy is toting this guy around with you.

992
01:06:27,658 --> 01:06:29,952
- "Are we kids, or what?"
- Get out of here!

993
01:06:30,077 --> 01:06:33,372
"Thanks, J.J., for what I consider
sound advice."

994
01:06:33,455 --> 01:06:35,165
Would you get out of here?

995
01:06:35,249 --> 01:06:37,960
- Is he crazy, or am I mistaken?
- He's weird.

996
01:06:41,046 --> 01:06:44,550
Do you think I'm doing the right thing
by getting married?

997
01:06:45,050 --> 01:06:47,261
Eddie, I can't tell you that.

998
01:06:47,553 --> 01:06:51,056
I keep thinking that I'm going to be
missing out on things.

999
01:06:53,058 --> 01:06:55,144
That's what marriage is all about.

1000
01:06:58,647 --> 01:07:01,442
But I never did a lot before. You know.

1001
01:07:03,068 --> 01:07:04,069
What?

1002
01:07:05,654 --> 01:07:07,072
I never did a lot of...

1003
01:07:08,574 --> 01:07:10,659
...not a lot of screwing around.

1004
01:07:10,743 --> 01:07:13,454
Some, you know. Of course. A little.

1005
01:07:15,873 --> 01:07:16,874
A little?

1006
01:07:18,375 --> 01:07:19,376
A little.

1007
01:07:22,046 --> 01:07:23,756
You son of a bitch.

1008
01:07:25,466 --> 01:07:27,676
You're a virgin, aren't you?

1009
01:07:30,554 --> 01:07:31,847
Technically.

1010
01:07:37,353 --> 01:07:39,271
You've got a lot to learn.

1011
01:07:43,776 --> 01:07:45,653
Who am I gonna learn it from?

1012
01:07:46,445 --> 01:07:47,279
Elyse?

1013
01:07:47,363 --> 01:07:49,573
Elyse doesn't know anything.

1014
01:07:52,451 --> 01:07:54,370
We could be in trouble.

1015
01:08:01,168 --> 01:08:03,879
Barbara, this is stupid. I mean, it's crazy.

1016
01:08:09,844 --> 01:08:12,555
I don't understand you, Barbara.
It's mine as well.

1017
01:08:12,680 --> 01:08:14,849
I have something to say in this too.
Don't I?

1018
01:08:14,849 --> 01:08:17,768
I'm not talking about
doing anything drastic.

1019
01:08:18,060 --> 01:08:19,979
An abortion, or anything like that.

1020
01:08:20,062 --> 01:08:23,482
- I have the feeling that I'm not included.
- Keep your voice down.

1021
01:08:23,566 --> 01:08:26,944
Who do you think you're talking to?
I'm half responsible for this mess.

1022
01:08:26,944 --> 01:08:29,071
Please, don't talk so loud.

1023
01:08:30,072 --> 01:08:33,242
This isn't the time or place
to talk about this very private matter.

1024
01:08:33,367 --> 01:08:35,744
- When is the time to talk about it?
- You're yelling...

1025
01:08:35,870 --> 01:08:38,581
Why don't we take a 10-minute break?

1026
01:08:47,381 --> 01:08:49,842
Barbara, what are we going to do?

1027
01:08:50,467 --> 01:08:53,053
We've got to talk about this.
We've got to try...

1028
01:09:01,854 --> 01:09:06,567
I can't believe this happened to me.
I'm hardly the adventurous type.

1029
01:09:09,361 --> 01:09:13,073
Somehow it just doesn't seem fair,
and that makes it very difficult.

1030
01:09:13,073 --> 01:09:14,575
Of course it's difficult.

1031
01:09:14,658 --> 01:09:16,952
Whether it's fair or not
makes no difference.

1032
01:09:17,077 --> 01:09:19,079
It's happened,
we must work it out together.

1033
01:09:19,163 --> 01:09:20,164
I know.

1034
01:09:22,666 --> 01:09:27,171
I have a great feeling for you, Willy.

1035
01:09:28,255 --> 01:09:30,257
You're my closest friend.

1036
01:09:31,383 --> 01:09:33,052
Barbara, I want you to marry me.

1037
01:09:36,472 --> 01:09:39,558
I will not marry you.
Not out of convenience.

1038
01:09:40,976 --> 01:09:44,271
Not because it's the thing to do,
which is what everybody else does.

1039
01:09:44,271 --> 01:09:46,774
Do you think that I'm asking you
to marry me because...

1040
01:09:46,857 --> 01:09:48,651
...it's what everybody else does?

1041
01:09:52,655 --> 01:09:56,075
Someday I may change my hairstyle,
but not yet.

1042
01:09:58,160 --> 01:10:00,871
- Okay. Whenever you're ready.
- All right.

1043
01:10:04,458 --> 01:10:06,752
The style you have
looks really good on you.

1044
01:10:06,877 --> 01:10:08,045
Thank you.

1045
01:10:11,048 --> 01:10:12,383
Watch your head.

1046
01:10:15,261 --> 01:10:16,345
Hi, Boog.

1047
01:10:17,054 --> 01:10:18,848
How you doin', Beth?

1048
01:10:20,182 --> 01:10:22,268
- Here's the Post.
- Thank you.

1049
01:10:23,853 --> 01:10:25,271
Is Mr. Andre here?

1050
01:10:25,354 --> 01:10:29,358
No. Mr. Andre, he stepped out
to get some coffee and donuts.

1051
01:10:29,483 --> 01:10:31,151
He'll be back. What's up?

1052
01:10:31,151 --> 01:10:34,071
We're all supposed to have our hair done
for the wedding.

1053
01:10:34,154 --> 01:10:35,656
The bridesmaids, the whole group.

1054
01:10:35,781 --> 01:10:39,368
And I'm in charge to make sure
that Mr. Andre can handle it...

1055
01:10:39,577 --> 01:10:44,081
...without any problems. Maybe get some
extra operators or something.

1056
01:10:44,164 --> 01:10:47,459
Yeah, I don't know what he has...
Can you get this?

1057
01:10:47,543 --> 01:10:49,670
I don't know what he has planned.

1058
01:10:49,879 --> 01:10:52,256
You're not going to go to work
that day are you?

1059
01:10:52,381 --> 01:10:55,050
No, but I'm sure he's got
something arranged.

1060
01:10:55,676 --> 01:10:58,554
Why don't you sit down over there
and he'll be right in.

1061
01:10:58,679 --> 01:10:59,555
Okay.

1062
01:11:00,681 --> 01:11:02,975
I'm gonna go out for a second.

1063
01:11:15,154 --> 01:11:19,158
- It's cold out here. I should get my coat.
- Come on. It's not that cold.

1064
01:11:19,867 --> 01:11:21,577
Where are we gonna go?

1065
01:11:21,869 --> 01:11:23,871
Let's go down here to my office.

1066
01:11:23,871 --> 01:11:25,664
- This is your office?
- Yeah.

1067
01:11:29,084 --> 01:11:30,044
Get in.

1068
01:11:30,753 --> 01:11:33,380
- What's the matter?
- You had a payment to make.

1069
01:11:33,464 --> 01:11:34,673
I'm going to make it.

1070
01:11:34,757 --> 01:11:38,344
You were supposed to make it last night.
Nobody in the office got a call.

1071
01:11:38,344 --> 01:11:42,056
That was a mistake. I forgot.
I've placed some bets tonight.

1072
01:11:42,264 --> 01:11:43,682
I'm gonna have it.

1073
01:11:43,849 --> 01:11:46,644
- Don't bullshit me, Boogie.
- I'm not bullshitting.

1074
01:11:47,853 --> 01:11:50,064
Tank, cut it out. I'm gonna make it.

1075
01:11:52,566 --> 01:11:54,360
Tank, what are you doing?

1076
01:11:56,278 --> 01:11:59,448
Who do you think you're fuckin' with,
some kid?

1077
01:11:59,573 --> 01:12:00,950
What are you doing?

1078
01:12:01,075 --> 01:12:03,244
Fun and games, a little kids' play
or something?

1079
01:12:03,369 --> 01:12:04,662
- I'll have it.
- I'm not amused.

1080
01:12:04,745 --> 01:12:07,164
- I'm not amused. Hear me?
- Don't hit me.

1081
01:12:07,248 --> 01:12:10,459
- Tank, what are you doing?
- No ifs, ands, or buts. All right?

1082
01:12:10,584 --> 01:12:12,378
- I'm gonna have it.
- Tonight.

1083
01:12:15,756 --> 01:12:17,174
Tank, don't...

1084
01:13:03,470 --> 01:13:04,471
Carol.

1085
01:13:05,681 --> 01:13:07,683
I was just thinking about you.

1086
01:13:09,351 --> 01:13:10,352
What?

1087
01:13:11,770 --> 01:13:12,855
The flu?

1088
01:13:14,773 --> 01:13:17,568
Yeah, I know.
That doesn't sound too good.

1089
01:13:18,777 --> 01:13:19,778
Yeah.

1090
01:13:22,364 --> 01:13:23,949
102°, huh?

1091
01:13:24,366 --> 01:13:26,452
Yeah, well listen. All right.

1092
01:13:27,286 --> 01:13:29,371
All right. Take care, and...

1093
01:13:30,581 --> 01:13:31,665
All right.

1094
01:13:31,874 --> 01:13:35,377
I'll call you back later and check up on you.

1095
01:13:36,462 --> 01:13:37,963
Okay. Bye-bye.

1096
01:14:06,575 --> 01:14:08,285
You feeling better?

1097
01:14:08,953 --> 01:14:13,457
Yeah, well, I'm not crying.
I think that's about the only improvement.

1098
01:14:17,962 --> 01:14:20,464
Boog, I want to thank you for last night.

1099
01:14:23,050 --> 01:14:25,261
I guess I just needed someone.

1100
01:14:26,762 --> 01:14:31,559
Don't thank me. It was... I don't know.
It just kind of felt like old times, you know?

1101
01:14:32,351 --> 01:14:36,355
Standing in the doorway,
I kind of felt like I was dating you again.

1102
01:14:39,650 --> 01:14:42,862
Boog, when we were datin',
did you care for me?

1103
01:14:43,779 --> 01:14:45,072
Sure I did.

1104
01:14:45,781 --> 01:14:48,784
No, I don't mean just because
you could do stuff to me, but...

1105
01:14:48,868 --> 01:14:51,287
...but because you really cared.

1106
01:14:51,453 --> 01:14:56,166
Of course, Beth. I mean there was plenty
of girls around for a quick pop.

1107
01:14:56,959 --> 01:14:58,878
If that's what I wanted.

1108
01:14:58,878 --> 01:15:01,964
But I got to tell you, you were good.

1109
01:15:04,884 --> 01:15:05,759
I was?

1110
01:15:07,553 --> 01:15:08,846
Believe me.

1111
01:15:11,765 --> 01:15:13,350
How would I rate?

1112
01:15:14,768 --> 01:15:17,354
You would rate way up there.

1113
01:15:17,980 --> 01:15:21,358
'Cause, I never told you this, but...

1114
01:15:23,360 --> 01:15:26,071
...I often think of the nights
that we spent together.

1115
01:15:26,155 --> 01:15:28,866
And that was a long time ago.

1116
01:15:29,366 --> 01:15:33,662
I don't have any sense of myself anymore.

1117
01:15:36,081 --> 01:15:38,083
I don't know what I am.

1118
01:15:41,462 --> 01:15:43,881
I don't know if I'm pretty or if I'm...

1119
01:15:46,050 --> 01:15:48,761
I just, I have no sense of me anymore.

1120
01:15:51,472 --> 01:15:52,473
Listen.

1121
01:15:53,474 --> 01:15:56,060
I don't know what Shrevie doesn't tell you.

1122
01:15:56,769 --> 01:15:58,854
But you don't have anything
to worry about.

1123
01:15:58,979 --> 01:16:01,649
You're a definite looker.
You're a very, listen to me...

1124
01:16:01,774 --> 01:16:04,985
...you're a very sexy lady. You are.

1125
01:16:10,157 --> 01:16:11,867
I think maybe we should...

1126
01:16:12,660 --> 01:16:14,453
...well, go out sometime.

1127
01:16:16,664 --> 01:16:18,666
I think we should get together.

1128
01:16:20,751 --> 01:16:23,087
Is Shrevie going to go over...

1129
01:16:24,672 --> 01:16:26,757
...for Elyse's football test?

1130
01:16:26,966 --> 01:16:27,883
Yeah.

1131
01:16:29,552 --> 01:16:30,553
Well?

1132
01:16:32,179 --> 01:16:33,472
I don't know.

1133
01:16:34,557 --> 01:16:35,975
Are you going?

1134
01:16:38,060 --> 01:16:38,978
No.

1135
01:16:43,649 --> 01:16:45,359
What do you think?

1136
01:16:49,071 --> 01:16:51,782
Maybe we can go out tonight, huh, Boog?

1137
01:16:54,952 --> 01:16:55,953
Yeah.

1138
01:17:02,168 --> 01:17:04,253
Yeah, we can get together.

1139
01:17:09,550 --> 01:17:12,553
Was George Shaw a first-round
draft choice?

1140
01:17:15,347 --> 01:17:17,766
First-round draft choice? True.

1141
01:17:18,058 --> 01:17:20,186
Wrong. He was a bonus pick.

1142
01:17:20,477 --> 01:17:22,271
Elyse, did you study?

1143
01:17:23,480 --> 01:17:27,484
Okay. That concludes the true-and-false
section of the test.

1144
01:17:27,985 --> 01:17:30,487
Let me get the short-answer stuff in order.

1145
01:17:30,571 --> 01:17:32,072
- Can I have a glass of water?
- No.

1146
01:17:32,156 --> 01:17:33,657
How's she doing?

1147
01:17:34,867 --> 01:17:38,787
Elyse has about a 72 so far.
But she's hitting a bad streak.

1148
01:17:39,079 --> 01:17:42,666
Before the Cleveland Browns joined
the NFL, they were in another league.

1149
01:17:42,750 --> 01:17:44,460
What was it called?

1150
01:17:45,085 --> 01:17:46,587
They were in another league?

1151
01:17:46,587 --> 01:17:48,547
- Yes, they were.
- I don't know.

1152
01:17:48,672 --> 01:17:50,257
This is hot. You have anything cold?

1153
01:17:50,382 --> 01:17:53,260
Elyse, don't get too close
to the answer sheet. Okay?

1154
01:17:53,385 --> 01:17:54,678
What's it now, Shrev?

1155
01:17:54,678 --> 01:17:55,971
Let me see.

1156
01:17:56,847 --> 01:17:58,682
What, passing is 65?

1157
01:17:59,266 --> 01:18:00,976
No. Passing is 65.

1158
01:18:01,060 --> 01:18:04,855
Buddy Young played for a team
that no longer exists.

1159
01:18:06,148 --> 01:18:08,484
What was the name of that team?

1160
01:18:11,987 --> 01:18:13,364
Anybody know that?

1161
01:18:13,364 --> 01:18:14,782
Not a chance.

1162
01:18:15,074 --> 01:18:17,076
The New York Yankees football team.

1163
01:18:17,159 --> 01:18:19,286
The New York Yankees football team?

1164
01:18:19,787 --> 01:18:23,165
They also were part of
the All-American Football Conference.

1165
01:18:23,249 --> 01:18:25,167
I contributed that question.

1166
01:18:27,878 --> 01:18:32,550
What was the longest run from scrimmage
by a rookie in his first game?

1167
01:18:33,467 --> 01:18:34,677
Alan Ameche.

1168
01:18:34,760 --> 01:18:36,971
Hey! We heard that in here.

1169
01:18:37,388 --> 01:18:39,765
I'm disqualifying this question.

1170
01:18:40,182 --> 01:18:43,185
I knew that. Seventy-nine yard run,
opening day 1955.

1171
01:18:43,185 --> 01:18:44,770
Good, Shrevie. You blew that.

1172
01:18:44,854 --> 01:18:48,148
I'm sorry. I got excited.
It's one of the few questions that I knew.

1173
01:18:48,274 --> 01:18:49,275
Sorry, Elyse.

1174
01:18:49,275 --> 01:18:51,652
- How many more?
- I don't know. I lost count.

1175
01:18:52,987 --> 01:18:55,573
Elyse's mother is on the phone.
How's she doing?

1176
01:18:55,656 --> 01:18:57,658
The guys think it could go either way.

1177
01:18:57,783 --> 01:18:59,368
Either way. Okay.

1178
01:19:01,787 --> 01:19:05,374
- Can I go to the bathroom?
- No. Okay. The Colts signed him.

1179
01:19:05,666 --> 01:19:08,377
A Heisman Trophy winner who decided
to play in Canada.

1180
01:19:08,377 --> 01:19:11,755
Now, however, he plays for the team.
What's his name?

1181
01:19:12,256 --> 01:19:13,966
Heisman Trophy winner.

1182
01:19:14,049 --> 01:19:16,260
- L.G. Dupre.
- No. Billy Vessels.

1183
01:19:16,260 --> 01:19:18,470
- I should've known that.
- Should-ofs don't count.

1184
01:19:18,470 --> 01:19:20,556
Vessels. Out of Oklahoma.

1185
01:19:21,056 --> 01:19:23,058
She could have racked up points
on that one.

1186
01:19:23,058 --> 01:19:25,186
I have no idea what the score is now.

1187
01:19:25,269 --> 01:19:28,480
You want to bet she goes down
for the count?

1188
01:19:28,564 --> 01:19:32,359
Last question. The Colts had a team here,
lost the franchise...

1189
01:19:32,568 --> 01:19:34,069
...then got one from Dallas.

1190
01:19:34,153 --> 01:19:36,864
What were the colors
of the original Colt team?

1191
01:19:37,948 --> 01:19:39,074
Ball buster.

1192
01:19:39,158 --> 01:19:41,660
- The original colors?
- My mother quizzed me on this.

1193
01:19:41,785 --> 01:19:43,370
Also my question.

1194
01:19:46,665 --> 01:19:48,375
- Green and gray.
- Right.

1195
01:19:49,668 --> 01:19:50,753
What a scrapper.

1196
01:19:50,878 --> 01:19:53,172
A tough question and she pulls it
out of the bag.

1197
01:19:53,172 --> 01:19:54,381
Very impressive.

1198
01:19:54,465 --> 01:19:55,758
Total's coming up.

1199
01:19:55,758 --> 01:19:58,052
True and false, 72.

1200
01:19:59,470 --> 01:20:01,972
Killer choices. Very confusing.

1201
01:20:02,556 --> 01:20:04,767
Short answer, 64.

1202
01:20:05,559 --> 01:20:08,187
- What do you think?
- I don't know. Pick 'em.

1203
01:20:08,771 --> 01:20:10,189
Cliffhanger.

1204
01:20:10,481 --> 01:20:12,066
The total is 63.

1205
01:20:12,983 --> 01:20:14,068
Sixty-three.

1206
01:20:14,360 --> 01:20:17,071
- I think you better check that again.
- Two points.

1207
01:20:17,571 --> 01:20:19,365
I checked the figures thoroughly.

1208
01:20:19,448 --> 01:20:21,659
- What will he do?
- He'll give 'em to her.

1209
01:20:21,784 --> 01:20:24,161
Good sportsmanship is worth two points.

1210
01:20:24,286 --> 01:20:28,249
Eddie, what about the Alan Ameche
question? I knew that one.

1211
01:20:31,460 --> 01:20:33,254
The marriage is off.

1212
01:20:49,061 --> 01:20:50,062
Hi.

1213
01:20:52,481 --> 01:20:55,484
- Where are we going?
- We'll go to Fenwick's apartment.

1214
01:20:56,151 --> 01:20:58,070
Hey, listen. Put this on.

1215
01:21:01,156 --> 01:21:02,575
What's that for?

1216
01:21:02,783 --> 01:21:04,159
In case somebody sees us.

1217
01:21:04,285 --> 01:21:07,454
They'll think you're Carol Heathrow
or somebody like that.

1218
01:21:09,957 --> 01:21:11,667
It's the craziest thing.

1219
01:21:17,965 --> 01:21:19,383
How does it look?

1220
01:21:21,051 --> 01:21:22,386
You look good.

1221
01:21:23,179 --> 01:21:24,680
Okay. Let's go.

1222
01:21:30,769 --> 01:21:34,356
I gave him the questions. What's thisjazz?
They were wonderful questions.

1223
01:21:34,356 --> 01:21:35,649
Go drive your truck.

1224
01:21:35,774 --> 01:21:38,569
Ask your son if they weren't
wonderful questions.

1225
01:21:39,069 --> 01:21:42,156
- I wasjust trying to have some fun.
- Don't raise your voice.

1226
01:21:42,281 --> 01:21:46,952
- I don't want you to raise your voice...
- How did I know it would end up like this?

1227
01:21:47,786 --> 01:21:51,165
- I'm going to the diner. Want to go?
- I got to validate the Heathrow bet.

1228
01:21:51,290 --> 01:21:52,958
Yeah, that's right.

1229
01:21:53,667 --> 01:21:55,753
Do you mind if I go with ya?

1230
01:21:56,587 --> 01:21:59,089
Come on. I'm not going to make any noise.

1231
01:21:59,882 --> 01:22:02,885
- It's a small closet. You've got to be still.
- Okay.

1232
01:22:03,052 --> 01:22:06,889
- Okay, let's take my car.
- No. Let's take mine. Get some fresh air.

1233
01:22:07,389 --> 01:22:10,267
Let's put the top up. It's freezing out here.

1234
01:22:15,564 --> 01:22:17,066
- Let's go.
- Okay.

1235
01:22:18,651 --> 01:22:21,487
- Let's go. Let's fly.
- Okay, Shrev. All right.

1236
01:22:23,864 --> 01:22:25,866
Any forward gear will do here.

1237
01:22:28,786 --> 01:22:31,455
Beth would kill me if she knew
what I was doing.

1238
01:22:57,565 --> 01:22:58,357
My Prayer?

1239
01:22:58,482 --> 01:23:01,861
Flip side, Heaven on Earth, recorded by
The Platters for Mercury Records.

1240
01:23:01,986 --> 01:23:03,779
Color of the label, maroon. Another.

1241
01:23:03,863 --> 01:23:05,072
I'm Stickin' With You?

1242
01:23:05,155 --> 01:23:08,284
I'm Stickin' With You,
flip side is Ever Lovin' Fingers.

1243
01:23:08,450 --> 01:23:11,370
Recorded by Jimmy Bowen
for Roulette Records.

1244
01:23:11,871 --> 01:23:14,790
Color of the label is orange. All right.

1245
01:23:15,082 --> 01:23:16,375
- Donna?
- Donna.

1246
01:23:16,375 --> 01:23:19,086
- Flip side?
- I thought Donna was the flip side.

1247
01:23:19,170 --> 01:23:20,462
It's La Bamba.

1248
01:24:05,382 --> 01:24:07,885
- Come on, I'll crouch. You stand.
- Fine.

1249
01:24:12,765 --> 01:24:14,850
- All right?
- Yeah, that'll be good.

1250
01:24:15,267 --> 01:24:16,560
- Can you see?
- Yeah.

1251
01:24:17,478 --> 01:24:18,562
I'm okay.

1252
01:24:18,562 --> 01:24:22,066
- Let's leave it open. I'm claustrophobic.
- Come on, Shrev.

1253
01:24:24,777 --> 01:24:28,072
- I should have taken my coat off too.
- Take it off. It's a closet.

1254
01:24:47,383 --> 01:24:48,467
Oh, God.

1255
01:24:49,677 --> 01:24:51,053
She's beautiful.

1256
01:24:59,770 --> 01:25:01,063
That's good?

1257
01:25:02,982 --> 01:25:06,777
You're going to have to be real quiet
when we get inside. No talking.

1258
01:25:06,986 --> 01:25:09,989
I think you're being a little paranoid, Boog.

1259
01:25:10,990 --> 01:25:13,868
The wall's are very, very thin.
You promise?

1260
01:25:14,577 --> 01:25:15,578
Okay.

1261
01:25:20,374 --> 01:25:22,251
Did you leave the door open?

1262
01:25:22,459 --> 01:25:23,669
What door?

1263
01:25:26,463 --> 01:25:27,756
What's going on?

1264
01:25:28,090 --> 01:25:30,176
They should be here by now.

1265
01:25:30,968 --> 01:25:34,555
- Boog, what are you talking about?
- Bet or no bet, it's not right.

1266
01:25:35,556 --> 01:25:38,475
Boog? Boog, what are you talking about?

1267
01:25:39,977 --> 01:25:41,478
Where are they?

1268
01:25:42,271 --> 01:25:45,482
- They're taking their time.
- I wonder what's happening down there.

1269
01:25:45,566 --> 01:25:48,277
- Come on, Boog.
- I think we're missing the show.

1270
01:25:57,286 --> 01:25:59,663
So, I was supposed to be Carol Heathrow?

1271
01:26:00,956 --> 01:26:02,166
That's right.

1272
01:26:03,792 --> 01:26:05,461
It was a sick thing to do.

1273
01:26:06,378 --> 01:26:07,463
I'm sorry.

1274
01:26:24,772 --> 01:26:26,065
Thanks, Boog.

1275
01:26:27,858 --> 01:26:28,984
What for?

1276
01:26:29,860 --> 01:26:33,989
You had enough respect for me
to call it off. That says a lot.

1277
01:26:35,282 --> 01:26:39,078
Look. I think you and Shrevie
should try to work out your thing.

1278
01:26:39,453 --> 01:26:41,789
Yeah. I just wish I knew what to do.

1279
01:26:44,291 --> 01:26:46,377
Yeah, I don't know. It's like...

1280
01:26:49,088 --> 01:26:53,384
This kind of problem with a girl,
I'm not too good about talking about it.

1281
01:26:53,467 --> 01:26:57,388
But, you know me.
If I have a problem with a girl, I just split.

1282
01:26:58,264 --> 01:27:01,767
But I think you and Shrevie should
work your thing out.

1283
01:27:03,060 --> 01:27:05,271
I think it would be worth it.

1284
01:27:06,856 --> 01:27:09,859
Boog, when I came to the beauty parlor
this morning, and...

1285
01:27:09,984 --> 01:27:11,986
...you said all those things...

1286
01:27:12,862 --> 01:27:14,280
...were you lying?

1287
01:27:17,867 --> 01:27:20,369
You'll always rate right up there.

1288
01:27:25,875 --> 01:27:27,668
- Come on, let's go.
- Okay.

1289
01:27:36,468 --> 01:27:38,971
What are you going to do
about the money?

1290
01:27:39,972 --> 01:27:41,390
I don't know.

1291
01:27:42,766 --> 01:27:45,269
Come on, Boog. Don't let us down, buddy.

1292
01:27:49,356 --> 01:27:52,985
We're missing all the action.
I'll bet he's getting her in hallway.

1293
01:27:57,156 --> 01:27:59,366
Can we have a couple more beers
over here?

1294
01:27:59,491 --> 01:28:01,660
Do you remember coppin' a feel?

1295
01:28:01,785 --> 01:28:03,078
How could I forget?

1296
01:28:03,078 --> 01:28:05,581
Boogie was the first. Seventh grade.

1297
01:28:07,791 --> 01:28:10,377
When I took out Ruth Ray,
I figured I had to do it.

1298
01:28:10,461 --> 01:28:12,463
- Ruth Ray, eighth grade.
- Right.

1299
01:28:14,757 --> 01:28:17,593
Sat on the couch
in her club cellar for hours...

1300
01:28:17,593 --> 01:28:20,179
...trying to figure out
how to get my arm around her.

1301
01:28:20,262 --> 01:28:22,681
Finally, I learned the move.

1302
01:28:23,182 --> 01:28:24,683
Do you know the move?

1303
01:28:24,975 --> 01:28:27,561
I yawned and put my arm
around her shoulder.

1304
01:28:27,686 --> 01:28:30,189
Then... Man, was I young.

1305
01:28:30,564 --> 01:28:34,360
Then came the big task of getting my hand
down to her breast.

1306
01:28:35,069 --> 01:28:37,988
By the time I got the nerve
to move down...

1307
01:28:38,155 --> 01:28:40,282
...I realized that my arm was asleep.

1308
01:28:40,366 --> 01:28:41,492
- No?
- Yeah.

1309
01:28:41,492 --> 01:28:45,663
There wasn't time enough to take it away,
get the feeling again, and start over.

1310
01:28:45,663 --> 01:28:48,374
I had to be in by 11:00.
Time was runnin' out.

1311
01:28:48,791 --> 01:28:52,670
The breast was moved toward,
with my arm asleep.

1312
01:28:53,254 --> 01:28:55,965
My first copping a feel was like this.

1313
01:28:58,259 --> 01:29:00,094
That doesn't even count.

1314
01:29:00,261 --> 01:29:02,763
Then I see the guys. You were there.

1315
01:29:02,888 --> 01:29:05,266
They say, "Did you cop a feel?"

1316
01:29:05,474 --> 01:29:09,478
I said, "Yeah." The guys said,
"How was it?" I said, "Great."

1317
01:29:09,562 --> 01:29:12,690
Do you mean to tell me that
you never copped a feel from Ruth Ray?

1318
01:29:12,773 --> 01:29:13,566
No.

1319
01:29:13,691 --> 01:29:14,984
You lied to me?

1320
01:29:15,276 --> 01:29:17,570
- I ought to kill you.
- You believed me.

1321
01:29:18,362 --> 01:29:19,655
I was dumb.

1322
01:29:23,993 --> 01:29:25,953
And you believed me, you dick.

1323
01:29:30,082 --> 01:29:33,085
Yeah, the whole thing with girls is painful.

1324
01:29:34,587 --> 01:29:38,465
And it seems like it keeps getting
more painful instead of easier.

1325
01:29:43,262 --> 01:29:44,889
Hey, Boog's here.

1326
01:29:55,858 --> 01:29:58,986
Where were you tonight?
We missed you Boog?

1327
01:29:59,069 --> 01:30:00,988
Yeah. You chicken out?

1328
01:30:03,073 --> 01:30:04,783
Yep, I chickened out.

1329
01:30:06,493 --> 01:30:09,872
Listen, Boog.
I think you should get out of here.

1330
01:30:10,164 --> 01:30:11,582
Tank's inside.

1331
01:30:11,790 --> 01:30:14,460
Why don't you wait out here till he splits?

1332
01:30:17,171 --> 01:30:20,174
He's just going to catch up with me
sooner or later.

1333
01:30:22,384 --> 01:30:26,263
I mean the hand is dealt.
I might as well just play the cards.

1334
01:30:30,684 --> 01:30:34,271
What do you think we should do,
in case something happens?

1335
01:30:34,688 --> 01:30:36,065
I don't know.

1336
01:30:49,370 --> 01:30:50,788
How're you doin', Tank?

1337
01:30:51,288 --> 01:30:52,957
You're a lucky man, Boog.

1338
01:30:54,291 --> 01:30:55,960
Yeah. Is that so?

1339
01:30:56,669 --> 01:31:01,257
This donkey in here, Bagel,
he paid your whole tab.

1340
01:31:04,885 --> 01:31:06,887
Bagel paid the money that I owe you?

1341
01:31:06,971 --> 01:31:09,682
Yeah, Boog. You're straight, like an arrow.

1342
01:31:12,393 --> 01:31:13,769
Shame, shame.

1343
01:31:14,478 --> 01:31:15,855
- Hey, Tank.
- Yeah?

1344
01:31:19,358 --> 01:31:20,776
All right, Boogie!

1345
01:31:22,862 --> 01:31:24,280
I owed you that.

1346
01:31:25,281 --> 01:31:26,490
What a punch!

1347
01:31:27,783 --> 01:31:30,494
Nice punch, Boogie. He put him down.

1348
01:31:30,661 --> 01:31:33,873
Smile of the week.
Definitely the smile of the week!

1349
01:31:34,290 --> 01:31:36,375
- What do you say, George?
- Nothing.

1350
01:31:42,381 --> 01:31:45,092
Thanks a lot, Bagel. I really appreciate it.

1351
01:31:46,677 --> 01:31:48,179
Your mother called me.

1352
01:31:48,262 --> 01:31:50,389
- She did?
- Yeah. She was hysterical.

1353
01:31:51,390 --> 01:31:54,059
So, out of respect for your father.

1354
01:31:55,686 --> 01:31:59,356
Your mother told me you're just
wasting your time in law school.

1355
01:31:59,481 --> 01:32:01,567
It's not for you. What do you say?

1356
01:32:02,484 --> 01:32:03,986
She's probably right.

1357
01:32:04,778 --> 01:32:06,989
So, why don't you come work for me?

1358
01:32:07,072 --> 01:32:08,282
You can't imagine...

1359
01:32:08,365 --> 01:32:11,785
...how much money there is to be made
in the home-improvement business.

1360
01:32:11,869 --> 01:32:15,789
And I can't think of anybody
who'd do it better than you would.

1361
01:32:17,791 --> 01:32:20,794
I'll tell ya. I was only going to law school...

1362
01:32:22,296 --> 01:32:24,590
...as a come-on for the girls.

1363
01:32:25,382 --> 01:32:26,675
They like that.

1364
01:32:26,675 --> 01:32:29,470
- Do they like it a lot?
- Yeah. They like it.

1365
01:32:30,596 --> 01:32:33,057
I mean, what the hell? I could lie.

1366
01:32:36,060 --> 01:32:39,855
Florence, could I have some French fries
with gravy please?

1367
01:32:41,565 --> 01:32:43,984
We'll call the $2,000 an advance.

1368
01:32:51,992 --> 01:32:54,995
Okay, but I've got
to tell you something, Bagel.

1369
01:32:55,371 --> 01:32:59,166
I'll work with you for a little while
until we square it off.

1370
01:32:59,375 --> 01:33:01,377
But, you know I got plans.

1371
01:33:03,462 --> 01:33:05,256
Always a dreamer, hey, Boog?

1372
01:33:06,882 --> 01:33:10,469
If you don't have good dreams, Bagel,
you got nightmares.

1373
01:33:17,560 --> 01:33:20,479
I'll tell you one thing that happens
when you get married.

1374
01:33:20,479 --> 01:33:22,773
You have to give up your old friends.

1375
01:33:22,982 --> 01:33:25,776
Because the wife wants you
to get new friends.

1376
01:33:25,860 --> 01:33:27,361
And new friends?

1377
01:33:28,279 --> 01:33:31,574
Nope. Cause you and me, buddy...

1378
01:33:31,866 --> 01:33:33,993
...we got secrets she'll never know.

1379
01:33:34,285 --> 01:33:37,872
Never know. Those new friends
could never be as good.

1380
01:33:38,080 --> 01:33:39,081
Nope.

1381
01:33:41,792 --> 01:33:43,377
We've got a history.

1382
01:33:44,295 --> 01:33:45,588
A history.

1383
01:33:47,756 --> 01:33:50,676
It won't change, Ed. Only if you let it.

1384
01:33:52,887 --> 01:33:55,764
This is getting me crazy. Come on.
Pick it up, guys!

1385
01:34:02,188 --> 01:34:03,856
You want to pick up the beat?

1386
01:34:03,856 --> 01:34:07,067
- Be quiet or we'll get thrown out.
- You going to pick up the beat?

1387
01:34:41,894 --> 01:34:43,187
It's classical.

1388
01:35:01,497 --> 01:35:02,790
That's crazy, man.

1389
01:35:16,679 --> 01:35:18,597
I'll pay for it. No problem.

1390
01:35:21,183 --> 01:35:22,184
My buddy!

1391
01:35:30,985 --> 01:35:32,278
That's better.

1392
01:35:44,456 --> 01:35:46,584
Come on, honey. You can shake it.

1393
01:37:16,090 --> 01:37:17,967
Billy, you've got magic fingers.

1394
01:37:18,092 --> 01:37:19,760
A regular Fats Domino.

1395
01:37:32,273 --> 01:37:33,482
Hold on a second.

1396
01:37:33,566 --> 01:37:35,359
Come on. Firstjoke you remember.

1397
01:37:38,988 --> 01:37:41,365
Fifth grade, Junior Scholastic Magazine.

1398
01:37:43,284 --> 01:37:46,996
Okay. "Hickory dickory doc.
The mouse ran up the clock.

1399
01:37:47,663 --> 01:37:51,667
"The clock struck one, and the other two
escaped with minor injuries."

1400
01:37:54,587 --> 01:37:57,089
- That's terrible.
- Fifth-grade humor.

1401
01:37:57,464 --> 01:38:00,885
Since then, it's moved up
to the sixth grade. Is that it?

1402
01:38:06,390 --> 01:38:09,185
- You're all right.
- You guys have really made my night.

1403
01:38:09,268 --> 01:38:11,478
You should come down
and hang out more often.

1404
01:38:11,562 --> 01:38:13,898
I can't. I'm gettin' married.

1405
01:38:14,899 --> 01:38:18,360
She would have gotten the Alan Ameche
question that Shrev screwed up.

1406
01:38:18,485 --> 01:38:20,779
- Benefit of the doubt.
- Exactly.

1407
01:38:21,363 --> 01:38:22,698
I love weddings.

1408
01:38:23,866 --> 01:38:27,369
I just never found the time to settle,
or even wanted to.

1409
01:38:28,495 --> 01:38:29,496
And you?

1410
01:38:30,581 --> 01:38:31,665
No marriage.

1411
01:38:31,790 --> 01:38:33,083
Got a girl?

1412
01:38:34,460 --> 01:38:36,587
Not really. Just in love.

1413
01:38:37,379 --> 01:38:40,090
- Does the girl know?
- Yeah, I told her about it.

1414
01:38:40,799 --> 01:38:41,884
Told her.

1415
01:38:42,676 --> 01:38:44,178
Didn't you show her?

1416
01:39:31,976 --> 01:39:33,269
Nice morning.

1417
01:39:33,686 --> 01:39:34,979
Yes, it is.

1418
01:39:36,397 --> 01:39:39,775
Mornings, I've often felt,
are a nice time to ride.

1419
01:39:41,193 --> 01:39:44,280
- Do you live around here?
- Not around here. Here.

1420
01:39:45,197 --> 01:39:47,283
Which means, you're trespassing.

1421
01:39:48,659 --> 01:39:51,495
- I'm just waiting for an invite.
- So, let's ride.

1422
01:39:51,996 --> 01:39:53,163
What's your name?

1423
01:39:53,163 --> 01:39:54,290
Boogie.

1424
01:39:54,498 --> 01:39:56,292
- Boogie?
- Bobby Sheftell.

1425
01:40:15,686 --> 01:40:17,396
Isn't she beautiful?

1426
01:40:26,280 --> 01:40:29,491
- What is that music?
- It's the Colt's marching song.

1427
01:40:30,201 --> 01:40:32,661
It's very tasteful. Very tasteful.

1428
01:40:41,670 --> 01:40:46,300
In the presence of this company
as witness, you have spoken the words...

1429
01:40:46,675 --> 01:40:50,095
...and performed the rites
which unite your lives.

1430
01:40:51,096 --> 01:40:55,976
I therefore declare, you Edward,
and you Elyse...

1431
01:40:56,769 --> 01:40:58,270
...husband and wife.

1432
01:41:00,189 --> 01:41:03,776
And now I ask you,
and all your dear ones here...

1433
01:41:04,485 --> 01:41:06,987
...to bow your heads in reverence.

1434
01:41:07,780 --> 01:41:11,367
Silently, let us pray,
that God will bless your home...

1435
01:41:11,867 --> 01:41:15,371
...and help you to achieve
your highest hopes.

1436
01:41:16,288 --> 01:41:17,289
Amen.

1437
01:41:24,672 --> 01:41:27,091
- You look very pretty.
- Thank you.

1438
01:41:27,299 --> 01:41:28,676
Blue becomes you.

1439
01:41:31,387 --> 01:41:33,973
I made us some reservations...

1440
01:41:35,266 --> 01:41:37,268
...for the summer in the Poconos.

1441
01:41:37,268 --> 01:41:38,686
For how long?

1442
01:41:38,894 --> 01:41:41,272
I think we might go for 10 days.

1443
01:41:41,480 --> 01:41:43,399
Ten days is good, yeah.

1444
01:42:04,587 --> 01:42:06,964
I'm thinking of going to Europe.

1445
01:42:09,300 --> 01:42:12,761
Why don't you stay in the United States
and just travel around?

1446
01:42:13,387 --> 01:42:17,683
I don't know. It's been done. Europe.
Europe looks like a smile.

1447
01:42:22,271 --> 01:42:24,690
Yes, I'll have my master's in business.

1448
01:42:25,399 --> 01:42:28,277
And then, I guess I'll come back.

1449
01:42:28,986 --> 01:42:30,988
"Blue moon

1450
01:42:33,574 --> 01:42:36,785
"You saw me standing alone"

1451
01:42:37,077 --> 01:42:39,997
Every time we go to a wedding,
we have to listen to this guy.

1452
01:42:40,080 --> 01:42:43,292
"Without a dream in my heart..."

1453
01:42:44,793 --> 01:42:46,170
I'll visit you, of course.

1454
01:42:46,170 --> 01:42:48,088
I'm not moving to another country.

1455
01:42:48,172 --> 01:42:51,675
Please come back soon.
I'll make you sandwiches. All right?

1456
01:42:55,095 --> 01:42:56,972
"Blue moon

1457
01:42:59,683 --> 01:43:03,395
"You knewjust what I was there for

1458
01:43:06,482 --> 01:43:09,902
"You heard me say a prayer for..."

1459
01:43:09,902 --> 01:43:12,488
I'm getting some hors d'oeuvres.
Would you like any?

1460
01:43:12,571 --> 01:43:16,367
Yeah, Bobby. Can I have a few more
of whatever these are?

1461
01:43:18,661 --> 01:43:20,663
They're good. Thank you.

1462
01:43:32,800 --> 01:43:33,968
Hi, boys.

1463
01:43:35,970 --> 01:43:37,388
Hello, test.

1464
01:43:38,973 --> 01:43:43,185
I don't want to bother you.
Ljust wanted to say a few words.

1465
01:43:43,894 --> 01:43:46,772
I didn't prepare anything or anything.

1466
01:43:46,772 --> 01:43:50,276
The guys told me to come up
and say a few words.

1467
01:43:50,568 --> 01:43:54,572
I was thinking that now
that Eddie's getting married, and...

1468
01:43:56,198 --> 01:43:59,368
...he won't really be hanging out
with the guys anymore...

1469
01:43:59,702 --> 01:44:03,163
...ljust wanted to say that we were
never really that crazy about you.

1470
01:44:03,289 --> 01:44:05,165
I'll be quite honest.

1471
01:44:05,499 --> 01:44:09,587
I didn't want to tell you sooner
because you're a sensitive person.

1472
01:44:10,379 --> 01:44:14,800
Ljust want to thank everybody
who's responsible for your being here.

1473
01:44:15,885 --> 01:44:19,889
I don't know if everybody knows what
Elyse had to go through to get married.

1474
01:44:19,972 --> 01:44:24,393
She was two points away from spending
the rest of her life by herself.

1475
01:44:24,393 --> 01:44:26,478
It was very... It was a sad thing.

1476
01:44:26,562 --> 01:44:30,566
And now she knows more about football
than most girls in America.

1477
01:44:30,566 --> 01:44:32,484
It's important, it really is.

1478
01:44:32,985 --> 01:44:37,865
We all know most marriages depend
on a firm grasp of football trivia.

1479
01:44:41,994 --> 01:44:45,789
Eddie gets crazy sometimes with sports.
I don't know if you know him, but...

1480
01:44:45,873 --> 01:44:49,877
...it's one thing to dress the room
in blue and white, with banners...

1481
01:44:50,169 --> 01:44:53,672
...and the cake in the shape of a football.
It was a little too much.

1482
01:44:53,797 --> 01:44:56,675
I thought it was out of line
when Eddie asked the Rabbi...

1483
01:44:56,675 --> 01:45:01,180
...to wear black and white stripes
and a whistle. That was wrong.

1484
01:46:13,169 --> 01:46:14,670
Would you look at this?

1485
01:46:14,795 --> 01:46:17,590
Another article talking
about this theory of evolution.

1486
01:46:17,673 --> 01:46:18,883
Can I have the sport's page?

1487
01:46:18,883 --> 01:46:21,468
Do you believe this?
I don't buy the whole thing.

1488
01:46:21,468 --> 01:46:25,097
They're saying that millions of years ago
there was a swamp.

1489
01:46:25,264 --> 01:46:26,682
I don't want to hear it.

1490
01:46:26,765 --> 01:46:31,187
In the middle of this murky, disgusting,
boggy water swamp, there's an amoeba.

1491
01:46:31,270 --> 01:46:32,980
This amoeba meets another amoeba...

1492
01:46:32,980 --> 01:46:35,774
...and they have a kid who's a fish
who crawls onto land.

1493
01:46:35,900 --> 01:46:38,402
And from one lousy amoeba
millions of years ago...

1494
01:46:38,402 --> 01:46:42,489
...that today there's some guy with
a winter coat on a corner yelling "Taxi!"

1495
01:46:42,865 --> 01:46:45,367
Where's that connection?
How can that possibly be?

1496
01:46:45,492 --> 01:46:48,078
- An amoeba has no legs.
- Why do you care how we evolved?

1497
01:46:48,204 --> 01:46:49,496
They can float.

1498
01:46:50,372 --> 01:46:53,167
- We're all animals.
- You're going to argue this with him?

1499
01:46:53,292 --> 01:46:56,670
It's notjust people.
It's not even animals, chickens, come on.

1500
01:46:56,795 --> 01:46:59,590
- How could chickens live in a swamp?
- That's ridiculous.

1501
01:46:59,590 --> 01:47:01,884
They can't even make it
out of a pot of frying oil.

1502
01:47:01,967 --> 01:47:05,471
Think of chickens, dogs, birds, cows,
little Cocker Spaniel puppies...

1503
01:47:05,596 --> 01:47:08,390
...living in a muddy swamp.
It's enough to make you sick.

1504
01:47:08,474 --> 01:47:11,685
Girls don't come from the same swamp,
that's for sure.

1505
01:47:11,769 --> 01:47:14,063
I don't know who makes up this stuff.

1506
01:47:14,188 --> 01:47:18,067
It's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.
People do not come from swamps.

1507
01:47:18,192 --> 01:47:20,069
They come from Europe.

1508
01:47:22,571 --> 01:47:26,700
- Where do people in Europe come from?
- What am I? Rand-McNally? It's...

1509
01:47:29,203 --> 01:47:31,372
Let me ask you something personal.

1510
01:47:31,497 --> 01:47:32,498
Sure.

1511
01:47:32,665 --> 01:47:35,292
Is it true that you took out Arlene Stanton?

1512
01:47:36,085 --> 01:47:37,378
- You heard that?
- Yeah.

1513
01:47:37,503 --> 01:47:39,463
Get out of here. Of course not.

1514
01:47:39,797 --> 01:47:42,800
Come on, it was Arlene.
Would you look at her?

1515
01:47:42,883 --> 01:47:44,593
- Would you touch...
- Would you?

1516
01:47:44,677 --> 01:47:48,180
- You're embarrassed, don't want to say.
- Get out of here.

1517
01:47:48,389 --> 01:47:51,183
- Once. I took her once.
- Did you spend money on her?

1518
01:47:51,267 --> 01:47:53,602
I'm not marrying her.
I went out for a drive.

1519
01:47:53,602 --> 01:47:56,689
- Why did you deny it when I asked you?
- I didn't deny that.

1520
01:47:56,772 --> 01:47:57,982
Wouldn't you deny it?

1521
01:47:58,065 --> 01:48:00,985
Ljust want to ask you a question.
Did you touch her, at all?

1522
01:48:01,068 --> 01:48:02,278
Of course not.

1523
01:48:02,403 --> 01:48:05,197
- Did you touch anything she touched?
- Did she touch you?

1524
01:48:05,281 --> 01:48:07,366
You guys are sick, you know that.

1525
01:48:07,575 --> 01:48:09,577
I heard you kissed her goodnight.

1526
01:48:09,702 --> 01:48:12,288
I'm dropping her off. You got to be polite.

1527
01:48:12,788 --> 01:48:14,665
Remind me never to kiss you.

1528
01:48:14,874 --> 01:48:18,502
- I'll make a note about that one, Shrev.
- Disgusting, Shrevie.

1529
01:48:18,502 --> 01:48:20,296
- You want to hear one?
- Yeah, go.

1530
01:48:20,379 --> 01:48:23,090
This guy's going home from work.
He has a brand new car.

1531
01:48:23,174 --> 01:48:24,675
- What kind of car?
- Doesn't matter.

1532
01:48:24,800 --> 01:48:27,469
- Brand new car, it doesn't matter.
- Let's hear it.

1533
01:48:27,595 --> 01:48:29,388
So, he pulls into this bar.

1534
01:48:29,763 --> 01:48:33,392
He says "Give me,
give me a scotch and soda."

1535
01:48:34,685 --> 01:48:36,395
He's drunk, right.

1536
01:48:39,690 --> 01:48:42,902
Would you let me tell thejoke?
So, he says:

1537
01:48:42,985 --> 01:48:46,488
"Yeah, give me a scotch and soda."
And so the bartender says:

1538
01:48:46,780 --> 01:48:49,074
"Do you really think
you should be having one?"

1539
01:48:49,200 --> 01:48:50,367
Why?

1540
01:48:50,701 --> 01:48:53,204
- Why what?
- Why should he not be having one?

1541
01:48:53,787 --> 01:48:57,374
I'mjust telling you thejoke.
I don't know why he asks him.

1542
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:00,002
So he looks at the guy and says:

1543
01:49:00,085 --> 01:49:03,088
"Sir, maybe it's none
of my business, but..."

1544
01:49:03,172 --> 01:49:04,965
- Oh, what?
- He forgot something.

1545
01:49:05,090 --> 01:49:07,384
This guy has no arms and no legs.

1546
01:49:07,468 --> 01:49:10,971
- How could he drive the car?
- It's a funnyjoke, but it doesn't work now.

1547
01:49:11,096 --> 01:49:11,889
Finish it.

1548
01:49:11,972 --> 01:49:15,100
No, I'm starting ajoke.
I spend 10 minutes building ajoke up.

1549
01:49:15,184 --> 01:49:17,770
- Let him finish.
- Now it's not going to be funny.

1550
01:49:17,895 --> 01:49:19,605
- Come on.
- It's not funny now.

1551
01:49:19,688 --> 01:49:21,190
- Tell thejoke.
- Just say it.

1552
01:49:21,273 --> 01:49:25,402
Do you remember that time
they brought a girl in here?

1553
01:49:25,903 --> 01:49:26,904
When was that?

1554
01:49:26,987 --> 01:49:30,074
- The only girl that ever set foot...
- They brought a girl here.

1555
01:49:30,199 --> 01:49:31,784
There's never been a woman.

1556
01:49:31,867 --> 01:49:34,578
- When we were in 10th grade...
- Everyone was younger.

1557
01:49:34,703 --> 01:49:36,997
- This place was great then.
- It was great.

1558
01:49:37,081 --> 01:49:38,874
Nice cars then, huh?

1559
01:49:39,291 --> 01:49:42,586
It used to be so cool to be older
and hang out here. But now...

1560
01:49:42,670 --> 01:49:46,882
But now we're older, and we're cooler,
and we're still hangin' out here.

1561
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:50,108
