1
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:21,866
What do you have for us?

2
00:03:21,968 --> 00:03:24,869
I think I may have found
something of interest.

3
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:30,671
Look at this.

4
00:03:30,777 --> 00:03:34,577
Some say she is an abomination
of nature.

5
00:03:34,681 --> 00:03:36,308
Carnival freaks?

6
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:39,010
Julius, don't waste our time.

7
00:03:39,118 --> 00:03:41,586
Yes, sir.
What can I get for you?

8
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:43,883
A glass of absinthe.

9
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:46,151
Right away, sir.

10
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:48,523
Flame it, and make sure
the glass is clean.

11
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:50,721
Yes, sir.

12
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:03,269
I like you Brimstone people.

13
00:04:03,376 --> 00:04:05,207
You never make a mess of the place.

14
00:04:06,112 --> 00:04:09,878
This woman-
What have you heard?

15
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:14,613
What might only be
the tall tales of drunks.

16
00:04:15,955 --> 00:04:20,722
<i>This person has tricks</i>
<i>that go beyond the things...</i>

17
00:04:20,827 --> 00:04:22,795
<i>normal people can do.</i>

18
00:04:22,895 --> 00:04:26,797
Come on, folks! Come on!

19
00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:30,462
The amazing Amanda!

20
00:04:34,073 --> 00:04:35,404
Yes!

21
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:38,877
Step right up!

22
00:04:38,978 --> 00:04:42,311
See the freak of all freaks!

23
00:04:42,415 --> 00:04:43,973
Ladies and gentlemen...

24
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:48,383
I give you the beautiful Rayne!

25
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:54,617
A creature so sensitive to water...

26
00:04:56,529 --> 00:04:58,292
the very touch of it...

27
00:05:01,167 --> 00:05:02,828
burns her skin!

28
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:07,268
Now-

29
00:05:11,611 --> 00:05:13,511
Painful.

30
00:05:13,613 --> 00:05:15,979
So look on.

31
00:05:18,017 --> 00:05:21,748
You are about to witness
a horrifying spectacle!

32
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:30,291
Look! Look at that!
Look at that!

33
00:05:43,543 --> 00:05:48,276
Her skin is healed!

34
00:05:49,315 --> 00:05:51,476
Look! The miracle!

35
00:05:52,318 --> 00:05:55,287
Look! The monster!

36
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:08,832
Inside.

37
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:26,544
Your fee.

38
00:06:26,652 --> 00:06:29,120
How long do you think
it will take to get there?

39
00:06:34,026 --> 00:06:38,861
Rayne, are you all right?

40
00:06:40,032 --> 00:06:42,660
I'm working on a plan
to get us out of here.

41
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:45,499
My uncle- He's a sailor...

42
00:06:45,605 --> 00:06:48,938
and he once told me of a place
where people play all day...

43
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:52,841
and the trees grow fruits
in every color of the rainbow...

44
00:06:52,945 --> 00:06:56,608
and the sunsets
set the whole sky on fire.

45
00:06:56,716 --> 00:07:00,049
Doesn't it sound wonderful, Rayne?

46
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:01,882
He'll send for us soon.
I know it.

47
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:06,124
Until then,
keep this close to you...

48
00:07:10,863 --> 00:07:12,888
for protection.

49
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:16,631
Good night, my friend.

50
00:07:36,522 --> 00:07:38,581
Good evening, Master Kagan.

51
00:07:38,691 --> 00:07:40,625
Domastir, how does the night find you?

52
00:07:40,726 --> 00:07:43,957
I have some disconcerting news.

53
00:07:44,063 --> 00:07:45,428
Out with it.

54
00:07:45,531 --> 00:07:48,728
There was an incident of blood rage
at the Sherban Carnival.

55
00:07:48,835 --> 00:07:51,770
A dhamphir.
A young woman.

56
00:07:56,943 --> 00:07:58,740
<i>Where is the girl?</i>

57
00:07:58,845 --> 00:08:00,176
There is no girl.

58
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:05,451
- We'll find her.
- No.

59
00:08:07,753 --> 00:08:11,154
Then she is alive, the little one
who slipped through my fingers.

60
00:08:11,257 --> 00:08:14,488
You must find her.
She poses a threat to my plans.

61
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:17,358
Send out your best spies, Domastir.

62
00:08:17,463 --> 00:08:18,862
Master Kagan.

63
00:09:15,688 --> 00:09:17,553
Lay still.

64
00:10:02,702 --> 00:10:03,930
Get away!

65
00:10:50,383 --> 00:10:54,342
Kagan is building an army of thralls,
and we're on our way to a carnival.

66
00:10:54,453 --> 00:10:58,617
Am I the only one
who thinks this is madness? Katarin?

67
00:10:58,724 --> 00:11:01,921
Then how do you suggest
we deal with this army, Sebastian?

68
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:05,556
Brimstone is a shadow
of its former self.

69
00:11:07,299 --> 00:11:10,826
I have yet to see the point
in finding this carnival.

70
00:11:10,936 --> 00:11:15,339
Listen, you two, when has a vampire
ever been held in captivity...

71
00:11:15,441 --> 00:11:17,534
let alone by a circus troupe?

72
00:11:17,643 --> 00:11:21,044
- She may be the one.
- You're focusing your energies on Kagan.

73
00:11:21,147 --> 00:11:23,047
This is what I've decided to do.

74
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:26,516
Haven't we wasted enough time
with fairy tales?

75
00:11:57,316 --> 00:12:01,810
This is the work of a young vampire
out of control.

76
00:12:04,523 --> 00:12:07,981
- Blood rage.
- Or, perhaps, a young dhamphir.

77
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:10,221
We have work to do.

78
00:12:38,624 --> 00:12:40,251
Sit still.

79
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:46,257
Did you see who it was
that bit you?

80
00:12:51,737 --> 00:12:53,602
Rayne, take my sword.

81
00:13:09,054 --> 00:13:12,080
I didn't see anything.
I don't even remember what happened.

82
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:15,558
You were bitten by a vampire, and you
don't remember anything that happened?

83
00:13:15,661 --> 00:13:17,652
- We should kill her now.
- Please.

84
00:13:17,763 --> 00:13:20,755
She didn't mean to bite me.
She's not a vampire.

85
00:13:20,866 --> 00:13:24,632
She was wearing a crucifix
I gave her when it happened.

86
00:13:24,737 --> 00:13:26,671
She is my friend.

87
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:40,008
We have more work to do.

88
00:13:41,086 --> 00:13:43,987
We passed a small village
not too far back.

89
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:47,354
I will see if I can find her hiding there.
With your permission.

90
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:49,154
Yeah.

91
00:13:52,798 --> 00:13:56,825
If she's what I think she is, we're
likely not the only ones looking for her.

92
00:14:25,097 --> 00:14:27,895
You requested me, Viscount.

93
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,468
I have a message for my daughter.

94
00:14:32,571 --> 00:14:34,129
Dearest Katarin-

95
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:40,872
All right, Katarin.

96
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:43,448
Although we've had our differences
in the past...

97
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:47,349
I beseech you now
to put away all grudges...

98
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:49,387
for the good of humanity.

99
00:14:49,488 --> 00:14:52,389
It pains me to admit...

100
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:56,052
that our beloved but weakened
Brimstone Society...

101
00:14:56,161 --> 00:14:58,425
can no longer defeat Kagan...

102
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:03,866
yet he must not be allowed to acquire
Beliar's artifacts nor legacy.

103
00:15:03,969 --> 00:15:07,427
Thus I turn to you, my daughter...

104
00:15:07,539 --> 00:15:11,498
<i>to help me protect...</i>

105
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:13,441
the souls of this land.

106
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:18,079
You and I are the only ones
who know what is hidden...

107
00:15:18,183 --> 00:15:22,347
in Brimstone Fortress-
its value, its importance.

108
00:15:22,454 --> 00:15:25,890
<i>I need you to bring</i>
<i>this artifact to me.</i>

109
00:15:25,991 --> 00:15:29,119
<i>It must be protected from those</i>
<i>who wish to use it to undermine me.</i>

110
00:15:30,062 --> 00:15:31,586
Scratch that.

111
00:15:31,697 --> 00:15:36,191
To undermine freedom
and humanity.

112
00:15:37,236 --> 00:15:39,796
And together we will stop
this madness...

113
00:15:39,905 --> 00:15:42,271
and bring peace to these lands.

114
00:15:42,374 --> 00:15:45,468
Your beloved father,
et cetera, et cetera.

115
00:15:45,577 --> 00:15:46,703
What do you think?

116
00:15:46,812 --> 00:15:49,975
A very compelling argument, master.

117
00:15:50,082 --> 00:15:52,607
You're such a suck-up.

118
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:32,957
Find your own meal.

119
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:54,335
Keep away from us.

120
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:06,848
I will not harm you.
I only wish to kill vampires.

121
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:23,508
- I'm sorry about your friend.
- He was my brother.

122
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:26,373
I'm sorry that
we had to leave him there.

123
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:31,140
- Why did you save us?
- I don't know.

124
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:35,880
- Where is your family?
- I don't have a family.

125
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:57,329
<i>Dhamphir, Dhamphir.</i>

126
00:18:57,436 --> 00:19:00,530
<i>Follow me. Follow me.</i>

127
00:19:09,548 --> 00:19:11,709
- Got it.
- Come on.

128
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:15,749
I see a journey in your future.

129
00:19:17,422 --> 00:19:19,913
A journey, perhaps, to within.

130
00:19:22,294 --> 00:19:26,594
Dhamphir, you don't know, do you?

131
00:19:28,967 --> 00:19:32,198
- I will stand.
- I was expecting you.

132
00:19:32,304 --> 00:19:35,705
- There's a reason you're here.
- What did you call me?

133
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:39,844
Most believe that your kind
are merely legends.

134
00:19:39,945 --> 00:19:43,039
It is rare to see a live dhamphir.

135
00:19:43,148 --> 00:19:45,343
Part vampire, part human.

136
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:50,183
Mostly they die at birth.
Generally they are exterminated.

137
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:51,847
You've hidden well.

138
00:19:57,062 --> 00:19:58,962
My tales hold some truth, I see.

139
00:19:59,064 --> 00:20:01,965
- There was a man.
- A man? Kagan?

140
00:20:02,067 --> 00:20:05,525
Kagan's not a man. He's a vampire.
And you are his creation.

141
00:20:05,637 --> 00:20:08,197
He killed my mother.

142
00:20:08,307 --> 00:20:12,175
Dhamphirs are rarely a product of a happy
union between a vampire and a human.

143
00:20:12,277 --> 00:20:13,244
You lie.

144
00:20:15,113 --> 00:20:17,104
Your poor mother.

145
00:20:24,022 --> 00:20:27,514
I will kill him.

146
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:32,662
Listen to me, Dhamphir-
and this is not easy to tell you...

147
00:20:32,764 --> 00:20:36,222
and will likely result
in great danger for all involved-

148
00:20:36,335 --> 00:20:40,669
Kagan has become
the most powerful vampire...

149
00:20:40,772 --> 00:20:43,502
taking advantage of a land with no law.

150
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:47,204
I do not care.
How do I find him?

151
00:20:48,547 --> 00:20:51,277
- You are naive.
- Tell me.

152
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:54,614
He resides in a guarded castle
beyond the dark mountains...

153
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,585
but there are no safe entrances.

154
00:20:56,688 --> 00:20:57,916
But...

155
00:20:59,891 --> 00:21:01,586
there is an ancient talisman...

156
00:21:01,693 --> 00:21:04,093
an eye that Kagan seeks.

157
00:21:04,196 --> 00:21:07,563
If you possess it,
you will certainly get an audience.

158
00:21:08,634 --> 00:21:11,626
- Why do you tell me this?
- Because it's my purpose...

159
00:21:11,737 --> 00:21:13,796
and the prophecy.

160
00:21:13,905 --> 00:21:17,033
They say this Talisman of the Eye...

161
00:21:17,142 --> 00:21:19,906
is kept in the Solambria Monastery
to the south.

162
00:21:20,012 --> 00:21:24,312
Be careful, my child. The Eye
is far more than a mere trinket.

163
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:26,611
The talisman holds great power...

164
00:21:26,718 --> 00:21:29,312
but it's important
that you move quickly.

165
00:21:29,421 --> 00:21:33,585
You will be doing the entire world
a great service keeping this from Kagan.

166
00:21:33,692 --> 00:21:38,254
I'm not interested in the world.
Only in Kagan.

167
00:21:39,164 --> 00:21:40,597
I thank you.

168
00:22:20,272 --> 00:22:23,969
The fortune-teller had a visitor.
This dhamphir is now in search of the Eye.

169
00:22:24,076 --> 00:22:26,271
Good. She can lead us to it.

170
00:22:26,378 --> 00:22:29,870
I highly doubt that her intent
is to deliver it to her long-lost father.

171
00:22:29,981 --> 00:22:33,781
Kill her. Let her find the Eye
or let her try, then kill her.

172
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,879
A dhamphir should be no match for you.

173
00:22:55,407 --> 00:22:59,207
Your suspicion was correct.
Domastir's on the move.

174
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,878
What is it, my child?

175
00:24:16,988 --> 00:24:19,218
I have been separated from my family...

176
00:24:19,324 --> 00:24:22,487
and have been traveling for three days
and nights without food or sleep.

177
00:24:22,594 --> 00:24:25,620
May I seek solace in your monastery
for a night's rest?

178
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:29,496
Please come in, my child.
Welcome to the Solambria Monastery.

179
00:24:43,849 --> 00:24:46,875
Enjoy your food,
and then you may rest.

180
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:48,384
Thank you.

181
00:29:18,056 --> 00:29:19,717
I suggest you follow me.

182
00:29:42,347 --> 00:29:44,508
You're not one of Kagan's, are you?

183
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:47,483
No. I mean you no harm...

184
00:29:47,585 --> 00:29:49,280
but I must leave now.

185
00:29:49,387 --> 00:29:51,287
I'm sorry.
You cannot leave.

186
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:55,025
It seems that you absorbed the Eye.

187
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:58,254
Our order has been guarding it
for centuries.

188
00:30:02,767 --> 00:30:04,325
Why do you protect it?

189
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:08,238
Because the Eye holds powers.

190
00:30:08,339 --> 00:30:12,332
Why do you think water
no longer burns you?

191
00:30:12,443 --> 00:30:16,777
There are three talismans-
an eye, a rib and a heart.

192
00:30:16,881 --> 00:30:21,341
They all belonged to a long-dead
vampire named Beliar.

193
00:30:21,452 --> 00:30:26,480
He discovered a method to defy
those elements that destroy vampires-

194
00:30:26,591 --> 00:30:31,290
water, sunlight and a cross.

195
00:30:31,396 --> 00:30:33,864
When he was finally defeated...

196
00:30:33,965 --> 00:30:36,456
his body was quickly dismembered...

197
00:30:36,568 --> 00:30:39,901
<i>and parts of it were hidden</i>
<i>all over the lands...</i>

198
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:42,234
<i>out of the reach of vampires.</i>

199
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:44,706
If they become united again...

200
00:30:44,809 --> 00:30:49,644
they could make a vampire
powerful enough to control the world.

201
00:30:49,747 --> 00:30:52,011
Beliar's not my concern.

202
00:30:52,116 --> 00:30:55,313
My mission is my own
and not of evil intent.

203
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:57,786
You are a vampire...

204
00:30:57,889 --> 00:31:01,052
yet you are immune to the cross.

205
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:03,184
I am a dhamphir.

206
00:31:03,294 --> 00:31:06,889
So Kagan's own offspring
is his enemy?

207
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:09,391
How is it you know about me?

208
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:12,367
There has been talk for years
that Kagan was in search...

209
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:14,768
of a prodigious child.

210
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:17,535
His bloodline is strong enough
to produce one.

211
00:31:18,643 --> 00:31:20,508
<i>He is our biggest threat.</i>

212
00:31:20,612 --> 00:31:23,911
<i>He has an army of thralls</i>-

213
00:31:24,015 --> 00:31:27,576
<i>humans who choose to work for him</i>
<i>rather than die.</i>

214
00:31:28,786 --> 00:31:32,051
<i>And they can do things</i>
<i>vampires cannot.</i>

215
00:31:32,156 --> 00:31:36,490
Now you understand why
I cannot let you leave with the Eye.

216
00:31:36,594 --> 00:31:40,394
Father! Father!
The monastery's being attacked!

217
00:32:17,335 --> 00:32:19,462
Don't let Kagan get the Eye.

218
00:33:52,964 --> 00:33:54,056
Where's the Eye?

219
00:33:59,904 --> 00:34:01,667
You fool.

220
00:34:05,843 --> 00:34:07,174
Kill her.

221
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:14,744
Hurry! Let's go!

222
00:35:31,863 --> 00:35:36,391
He's taking her to Kagan's.
You must go back to Brimstone.

223
00:35:36,501 --> 00:35:39,698
Put them on full alert that
the monastery has been attacked...

224
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:41,169
and the Eye is gone.

225
00:35:59,724 --> 00:36:01,419
Brimstone.

226
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:20,109
Come closer.

227
00:36:26,751 --> 00:36:28,651
Don't be afraid.

228
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:31,874
- Leonid's lair.
- Why would Domastir bring her here?

229
00:37:31,983 --> 00:37:34,543
Perhaps she needs to feed,
or the sun.

230
00:37:34,652 --> 00:37:37,678
Now that she has the Eye,
we must capture her.

231
00:37:37,788 --> 00:37:40,313
Bring her back to Brimstone
before it's too late.

232
00:37:59,977 --> 00:38:03,242
Domastir, Domastir,
why do you come here...

233
00:38:03,347 --> 00:38:07,647
and insult my palace
with your stench?

234
00:38:07,752 --> 00:38:09,481
I need shelter till nightfall.

235
00:38:31,208 --> 00:38:33,438
Is that a gift you've laid
at my feet, Domastir?

236
00:38:33,544 --> 00:38:37,036
How delightful.

237
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:39,776
No, Leonid, she is Kagan's.

238
00:38:48,759 --> 00:38:52,286
Kagan, the mightiest...

239
00:38:52,396 --> 00:38:56,526
of all vampires.

240
00:39:01,572 --> 00:39:02,937
Funny, Domastir.

241
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:08,372
I do not see him.

242
00:39:22,226 --> 00:39:23,488
Yes.

243
00:39:24,628 --> 00:39:28,189
She'll make a fine addition
to my collection.

244
00:39:28,299 --> 00:39:30,529
Touch her and your fingers are gone!

245
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:35,198
Such a dedicated peon.

246
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:38,265
Fine. Take her, then.

247
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:40,401
I have more than enough...

248
00:39:42,012 --> 00:39:44,845
to satisfy my needs.

249
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:56,686
But none with an eye like that.

250
00:39:58,362 --> 00:39:59,989
She stays.

251
00:40:00,097 --> 00:40:01,997
Remove him.

252
00:40:29,794 --> 00:40:31,056
Help me.

253
00:40:31,162 --> 00:40:32,322
Cut it.

254
00:40:45,876 --> 00:40:49,368
Where did you acquire such a gem?

255
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,380
Give it to me...

256
00:40:51,482 --> 00:40:54,713
and I will let you live.

257
00:40:54,819 --> 00:40:56,719
Give it to me.

258
00:41:04,862 --> 00:41:07,888
You have the Eye!
You give it to me!

259
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,860
Give it to me,
or I'll rip it out of your face!

260
00:41:45,202 --> 00:41:47,932
So, we meet again.

261
00:41:48,038 --> 00:41:51,804
Vladimir, I've always admired your spirit.
It's a shame you must die.

262
00:41:53,477 --> 00:41:54,739
You fool, Vladimir!

263
00:42:05,089 --> 00:42:07,751
The Eye. The Eye!

264
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:32,011
Let's get her out.

265
00:43:01,545 --> 00:43:03,706
How can you be certain
she'll be useful to us?

266
00:43:03,814 --> 00:43:07,841
She has already been useful.
She stopped Kagan from getting the Eye.

267
00:43:07,952 --> 00:43:09,817
- Yes, Vladimir, but-
- Listen.

268
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,684
I've been hunting vampires
since before you were born...

269
00:43:14,558 --> 00:43:19,621
and there was always one
that I suspected, or hoped, existed.

270
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:22,062
We have to consider
what she is, Vladimir.

271
00:43:22,166 --> 00:43:25,727
If she was simply a vampire,
crossing the water would kill her.

272
00:43:25,836 --> 00:43:29,135
And there's also that...

273
00:43:29,239 --> 00:43:32,731
which most vampires
are not fond of having.

274
00:43:32,843 --> 00:43:34,208
Where are you taking me?

275
00:43:34,311 --> 00:43:36,040
You should be grateful you're still alive.

276
00:43:36,146 --> 00:43:39,843
We helped each other.
I do not need you anymore.

277
00:43:43,687 --> 00:43:46,019
I should skin you
and hang you on display.

278
00:43:46,123 --> 00:43:49,991
- Where's the Eye?
- It has somehow become a part of her.

279
00:43:50,094 --> 00:43:52,062
It has assimilated.

280
00:43:52,162 --> 00:43:53,925
She must be brought to me alive.

281
00:43:54,031 --> 00:43:55,999
Leave me.
I'll send further instructions.

282
00:43:57,968 --> 00:44:01,563
Does she have a name, the dhamphir?

283
00:44:01,672 --> 00:44:03,765
I have heard she is called Rayne.

284
00:44:05,009 --> 00:44:06,499
Rayne?

285
00:44:11,615 --> 00:44:13,105
What is this place?

286
00:44:13,217 --> 00:44:16,050
Welcome to the headquarters
of the Brimstone Society.

287
00:44:28,365 --> 00:44:29,957
All in good reason, I hope.

288
00:44:30,067 --> 00:44:33,195
There was a messenger killed
in the monastery.

289
00:44:42,413 --> 00:44:45,541
Master, the talisman has arrived.

290
00:44:47,284 --> 00:44:49,081
Excellent.

291
00:44:50,821 --> 00:44:53,517
This dhamphir's inconsequential.

292
00:44:53,624 --> 00:44:55,751
It's Kagan you should be interested in.

293
00:44:56,727 --> 00:44:59,821
There was a Brimstone in Rome.

294
00:44:59,930 --> 00:45:02,660
It has been completely annihilated.

295
00:45:02,766 --> 00:45:05,326
And that's not all.

296
00:45:05,436 --> 00:45:07,461
Kagan has the Rib.

297
00:45:08,505 --> 00:45:09,836
Release me.

298
00:45:12,242 --> 00:45:14,142
What would make us think
that you won't attack?

299
00:45:14,244 --> 00:45:16,178
I told you...

300
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:18,510
I do not thirst for human blood.

301
00:45:19,783 --> 00:45:24,277
If you have live animals here-
rats, even-

302
00:45:24,388 --> 00:45:27,846
I will regain my strength quickly
and be on my way.

303
00:45:27,958 --> 00:45:29,448
I don't trust her.

304
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,824
I want what you want-

305
00:45:31,929 --> 00:45:35,228
to bring Kagan to ruin.

306
00:45:35,332 --> 00:45:39,462
I speak the truth.
He raped my mother...

307
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:43,973
and murdered her
in front of my own eyes.

308
00:46:56,446 --> 00:46:58,073
Where is she?

309
00:47:05,289 --> 00:47:07,689
- Where is the girl?
- There is no girl.

310
00:47:33,884 --> 00:47:35,613
I will find her.

311
00:48:13,490 --> 00:48:15,685
Sometimes
we must have faith in others.

312
00:48:16,526 --> 00:48:20,360
I believe you know that it's useless
to fight Kagan alone.

313
00:48:20,464 --> 00:48:23,160
If you wish, you're welcome
to stay here and train with us.

314
00:48:23,267 --> 00:48:25,497
Thank you.

315
00:48:26,904 --> 00:48:28,701
May I have my swords?

316
00:48:30,407 --> 00:48:33,137
All in good time.

317
00:48:33,243 --> 00:48:35,177
Give her what she needs.

318
00:48:49,893 --> 00:48:52,020
Yes, Katarin?

319
00:48:52,129 --> 00:48:55,530
What lies ahead? Will you be
opening up the gates to the thralls?

320
00:48:57,935 --> 00:48:59,459
That's ridiculous.

321
00:48:59,569 --> 00:49:01,230
I am loyal to you, Vladimir...

322
00:49:01,338 --> 00:49:04,364
yet you're breaking the very laws
and teachings you swore by.

323
00:49:04,474 --> 00:49:07,136
Your new found faith scares me.

324
00:49:07,244 --> 00:49:09,371
What will happen to Brimstone
in the event of battle?

325
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:12,248
I don't have all the answers.

326
00:49:15,018 --> 00:49:17,578
We're growing weak.

327
00:49:31,668 --> 00:49:33,295
Come on!

328
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:44,777
Control.

329
00:49:44,881 --> 00:49:47,782
Physical strength without control
means nothing.

330
00:49:47,884 --> 00:49:49,875
Once again, from the beginning.

331
00:51:07,631 --> 00:51:09,622
They belonged to a friend.

332
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:12,861
I know someone
that might be able to help.

333
00:51:24,948 --> 00:51:29,214
Our seamstress has prepared
some clothing.

334
00:51:29,319 --> 00:51:31,879
I hope they're to your liking.

335
00:51:35,959 --> 00:51:38,655
Are you all right?

336
00:51:38,762 --> 00:51:43,529
Ever since I got here, there are
these noises that persist in my head.

337
00:51:45,435 --> 00:51:47,335
I'm sure there's some reason for that.

338
00:51:47,437 --> 00:51:49,166
I don't know.

339
00:51:49,272 --> 00:51:51,502
If you're feeling up to it...

340
00:51:51,608 --> 00:51:53,838
you're more than welcome
to join us for dinner.

341
00:51:54,878 --> 00:51:57,813
I don't think the food you have there
will be of interest to me.

342
00:51:59,616 --> 00:52:04,019
You act as though
you're the only one who feels pain.

343
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:07,090
What do you know of pain?

344
00:52:07,190 --> 00:52:08,987
My father's Kagan.

345
00:52:09,092 --> 00:52:12,084
My mother was killed
before my own eyes.

346
00:52:17,667 --> 00:52:22,161
My mother and father
were both killed...

347
00:52:22,272 --> 00:52:23,830
by Vladimir.

348
00:52:25,242 --> 00:52:29,269
They had turned,
and I was to be slaughtered.

349
00:52:29,379 --> 00:52:34,248
Had he not arrived,
I would not be here today.

350
00:55:03,266 --> 00:55:05,564
Your food.

351
00:55:05,669 --> 00:55:08,502
What, are we sitting
at the table of the children?

352
00:55:08,605 --> 00:55:10,334
We're running out of food.

353
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:14,274
We have to go to the mainland
and get supplies.

354
00:55:14,377 --> 00:55:16,277
No. It's not a good idea.

355
00:55:16,379 --> 00:55:20,008
- We'll have to make do with what we have.
- We have to eat.

356
00:55:28,825 --> 00:55:33,785
Perhaps your savior
can multiply our supplies.

357
00:55:36,866 --> 00:55:40,859
Welcome.
Won't you come sit with us?

358
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:53,649
It seems you've become very popular.

359
00:55:53,750 --> 00:55:58,380
I think you've breathed
some new hope into the Society.

360
00:55:58,488 --> 00:56:01,719
- This surprises you?
- I thought they would be afraid of me.

361
00:56:01,825 --> 00:56:04,794
They only fear what they do not know.

362
00:56:05,762 --> 00:56:07,389
Can I see your teeth?

363
00:56:08,765 --> 00:56:09,959
Darius.

364
00:56:11,701 --> 00:56:13,601
So you're satisfied
with your new clothing?

365
00:56:14,738 --> 00:56:17,172
Yes. Thank you.

366
00:56:28,752 --> 00:56:30,276
<i>Father...</i>

367
00:56:30,387 --> 00:56:33,015
<i>in the days since</i>
<i>I received your letter...</i>

368
00:56:33,123 --> 00:56:37,685
<i>I have come to see certain truths</i>
<i>that now give me pause.</i>

369
00:56:37,794 --> 00:56:40,490
<i>I believe that you are right.</i>

370
00:56:40,597 --> 00:56:43,794
<i>Brimstone is lost.</i>

371
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:47,199
Be sure this message arrives.

372
00:56:47,303 --> 00:56:51,103
- It is of grave importance.
- Yes, Katarin.

373
00:57:04,888 --> 00:57:07,413
The spoils of Rome.

374
00:57:07,524 --> 00:57:10,118
Only one Brimstone remains.

375
00:57:10,226 --> 00:57:12,524
Bring me my thralls.

376
00:57:14,998 --> 00:57:18,900
<i>The time has come to fulfill your oaths,</i>
<i>my loyal thralls.</i>

377
00:57:19,002 --> 00:57:21,562
<i>Scour the land.</i>
<i>Find Brimstone and destroy it.</i>

378
00:57:21,671 --> 00:57:25,402
<i>Bring the dhamphir to me.</i>
<i>Leave no human alive that crosses you.</i>

379
00:57:25,508 --> 00:57:28,409
<i>The promise of eternal life</i>
<i>awaits those who succeed.</i>

380
00:57:28,511 --> 00:57:30,411
<i>Those who fail will find only death.</i>

381
00:57:38,488 --> 00:57:41,355
- Nice form.
- Finally we agree on something.

382
00:57:44,861 --> 00:57:48,319
Vladimir needs you.
He's in the courtyard.

383
00:57:48,431 --> 00:57:50,661
Good match.

384
00:57:50,767 --> 00:57:52,735
Until we duel again.

385
00:57:57,607 --> 00:57:59,404
You duel?

386
00:57:59,509 --> 00:58:01,500
A little.

387
00:58:11,988 --> 00:58:15,549
Your form is weak.
You're lacking passion.

388
00:58:15,658 --> 00:58:18,855
It's part of my plan.
I am tiring you out.

389
00:58:18,962 --> 00:58:21,430
Your plan is lacking passion as well.

390
00:58:25,235 --> 00:58:28,033
I see they have taught you well.

391
00:58:28,137 --> 00:58:32,972
Hardly. I was trained in battle
by a great warrior...

392
00:58:33,076 --> 00:58:35,943
one whom has long disappeared
fighting alongside Brimstone.

393
00:58:36,045 --> 00:58:37,808
My father.

394
00:58:40,049 --> 00:58:43,416
- Where is this warrior now?
- He is now a cursed enemy.

395
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:46,489
A vampire.
My loyalties lie with Vladimir...

396
00:58:46,589 --> 00:58:50,252
and the Brimstone
my father protected as a human.

397
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:52,760
And what do your loyalties consist of?

398
00:58:52,862 --> 00:58:56,889
You're a curious one. My purpose
is to fulfill my father's will-

399
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,628
killing the very thing he's become.

400
00:59:02,772 --> 00:59:06,139
It seems all this chatter
has veered me from the task at hand.

401
00:59:06,242 --> 00:59:08,267
You should pay more attention.

402
00:59:11,180 --> 00:59:14,479
Keep your friends close,
enemies even closer.

403
00:59:14,584 --> 00:59:16,814
Vladimir taught me that.

404
00:59:18,688 --> 00:59:20,519
We shall continue this later.

405
00:59:33,937 --> 00:59:37,464
Good evening, Viscount.
Kagan sends his regards.

406
00:59:40,543 --> 00:59:45,310
I assume you were expecting this message
from Brimstone from Katarin?

407
00:59:47,317 --> 00:59:49,615
Would you stop throwing things at me?

408
00:59:49,719 --> 00:59:54,053
You know, Elrick, Kagan has
little patience for ambitious vampires...

409
00:59:54,157 --> 00:59:56,853
especially those that were once Brimstone.

410
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:58,985
Can a vampire not receive word
from his own daughter...

411
00:59:59,095 --> 01:00:01,723
without being cast as a rebel
in search of power?

412
01:00:01,831 --> 01:00:05,198
- Is that the plan?
- Plans are for humans.

413
01:00:05,301 --> 01:00:07,201
I think destiny
is a more appropriate term.

414
01:00:07,303 --> 01:00:11,034
Where is Brimstone? Tell me now,
or suffer the consequences.

415
01:00:11,140 --> 01:00:14,303
Even you must sense
that change is upon us.

416
01:00:14,410 --> 01:00:16,537
This land has become unsettled.

417
01:00:16,646 --> 01:00:20,309
The future must be held
in the hands of human-born...

418
01:00:20,416 --> 01:00:22,384
and vampire-perfected.

419
01:00:23,486 --> 01:00:25,579
That is an invitation, by the way.

420
01:00:27,624 --> 01:00:30,354
Spare Katarin, unseat Kagan...

421
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:34,920
and join me in a, shall we say,
more colorful reign.

422
01:00:37,767 --> 01:00:41,168
Kagan's gratitude or Kagan's wrath.

423
01:00:41,270 --> 01:00:43,067
Now, where's Brimstone?

424
01:00:43,172 --> 01:00:45,265
You honestly expect me...

425
01:00:46,676 --> 01:00:48,576
to betray my daughter?

426
01:00:48,678 --> 01:00:50,543
You know, it's funny.

427
01:00:50,647 --> 01:00:52,842
You never struck me
as the paternal type.

428
01:00:52,949 --> 01:00:54,849
Now, get me the map.

429
01:00:56,452 --> 01:00:59,216
Give us our destiny.

430
01:00:59,389 --> 01:01:02,950
We leave now,
and that will be the end of it.

431
01:01:03,059 --> 01:01:05,619
You should travel with Sebastian.

432
01:01:07,530 --> 01:01:09,930
Is there something
you want to speak about?

433
01:01:11,968 --> 01:01:14,129
You should not travel with her.

434
01:01:14,237 --> 01:01:17,968
She's a danger to you.
Kagan is surely out looking for her.

435
01:01:18,074 --> 01:01:21,976
You're an important part
of the Brimstone Society.

436
01:01:22,078 --> 01:01:25,445
Your work defending the fortress...

437
01:01:25,548 --> 01:01:28,483
is essential to
our struggle and survival.

438
01:01:28,584 --> 01:01:32,076
And no one has ever questioned that.

439
01:01:32,188 --> 01:01:34,452
I am not seeking praises.

440
01:01:34,557 --> 01:01:38,084
- I seek to feel secure.
- You are a leader.

441
01:01:38,194 --> 01:01:39,718
Rayne is a fighter.

442
01:01:39,829 --> 01:01:43,424
I will take Sebastian if it pleases you.

443
01:02:03,052 --> 01:02:05,646
Iancu's been a friend for many years...

444
01:02:05,755 --> 01:02:07,882
and a defender of the Society.

445
01:02:09,792 --> 01:02:11,692
We're very fortunate to have him.

446
01:02:17,366 --> 01:02:19,391
Iancu has visitors.

447
01:02:20,770 --> 01:02:23,933
Come for some chops, have you?

448
01:02:26,976 --> 01:02:28,603
We'll be downstairs.

449
01:02:35,551 --> 01:02:38,714
Watch your step.
It's a long way down.

450
01:02:38,821 --> 01:02:40,812
Your kind of place.

451
01:02:54,537 --> 01:02:56,164
Domastir.

452
01:02:59,075 --> 01:03:01,066
We must move quickly.

453
01:03:08,251 --> 01:03:09,878
What are those?

454
01:03:11,154 --> 01:03:13,918
Black powder from China.

455
01:03:14,991 --> 01:03:16,959
We will take them.

456
01:03:18,828 --> 01:03:20,693
Is everything ready?

457
01:03:23,132 --> 01:03:24,827
Take anything else you need.

458
01:03:25,735 --> 01:03:27,362
Holy water.

459
01:03:44,187 --> 01:03:47,884
- A gift from Brimstone.
- Thank you.

460
01:04:30,533 --> 01:04:33,434
Brimstone's attacked.
They're all dead.

461
01:04:33,536 --> 01:04:37,404
- That's not possible.
- It was Domastir and the thralls.

462
01:04:41,210 --> 01:04:42,734
Are there any survivors?

463
01:04:44,847 --> 01:04:47,543
You can't go back.
There's too many.

464
01:04:47,650 --> 01:04:51,017
- They came looking for you.
- How did they find us?

465
01:04:53,856 --> 01:04:56,222
I have dressings for his wounds.

466
01:05:02,231 --> 01:05:04,859
This doesn't feel right.

467
01:05:04,967 --> 01:05:08,198
- How would they know?
- This is what Kagan wants.

468
01:05:08,304 --> 01:05:12,206
To lure back
what's left of Brimstone to him...

469
01:05:12,308 --> 01:05:14,208
so he can destroy us
once and for all.

470
01:05:14,310 --> 01:05:17,746
Domastir will pay with his life for this.

471
01:05:17,847 --> 01:05:20,941
If they want a fight,
a fight they will get.

472
01:05:26,222 --> 01:05:27,621
It was Katarin.

473
01:05:27,723 --> 01:05:31,386
You must choose.
Bargain for freedom...

474
01:05:31,494 --> 01:05:34,054
or leave your children motherless
as a Brimstone martyr.

475
01:05:34,163 --> 01:05:35,323
Never!

476
01:05:37,566 --> 01:05:39,659
<i>She's turned.</i>

477
01:05:52,848 --> 01:05:55,146
He's dead.

478
01:06:30,619 --> 01:06:32,610
-Just let me go.
- I can't.

479
01:06:32,722 --> 01:06:34,690
- You will.
- Where are you going?

480
01:06:34,790 --> 01:06:36,758
I'm going on my own.

481
01:06:38,427 --> 01:06:40,588
Everyone who comes near me dies.

482
01:06:40,696 --> 01:06:43,130
They came looking for me and the Eye.

483
01:06:43,232 --> 01:06:46,690
None of those people had to die.
You too will be dead if I stay with you.

484
01:06:46,802 --> 01:06:50,568
- You don't have to do this.
- I'm going to find the Heart.

485
01:06:50,673 --> 01:06:54,507
With two of the talismans,
I will stand a chance against Kagan.

486
01:06:54,610 --> 01:06:56,578
How do you expect to find the Heart?

487
01:06:56,679 --> 01:06:58,806
I can hear it.

488
01:07:00,716 --> 01:07:02,741
Good-bye, Sebastian.

489
01:07:05,287 --> 01:07:08,654
Just wait. Wait.
Stop. Here.

490
01:07:11,894 --> 01:07:13,452
You can wear this with pride.

491
01:07:15,765 --> 01:07:17,392
Please?

492
01:07:20,436 --> 01:07:21,801
And here.

493
01:07:25,441 --> 01:07:28,239
This will protect you.

494
01:08:43,586 --> 01:08:46,885
Sir, we've searched the entire grounds.
There's no sign of the dhamphir.

495
01:08:48,657 --> 01:08:51,524
She is not amongst the dead either, sir.

496
01:08:52,995 --> 01:08:54,519
Perhaps she was never here.

497
01:09:00,002 --> 01:09:03,768
We must return to Kagan.
She could be on her way there now.

498
01:09:03,873 --> 01:09:07,001
- Prepare the boats!
- Yes, sir.

499
01:09:29,165 --> 01:09:31,190
The Heart.

500
01:09:42,945 --> 01:09:45,277
Perhaps there's some truth
to this prophecy after all.

501
01:09:45,381 --> 01:09:48,942
Even if she has the Heart,
she can't face Kagan alone.

502
01:10:05,134 --> 01:10:06,601
Nothing yet.

503
01:10:06,702 --> 01:10:09,432
- Are you certain that it's down there?
- Are you questioning me?

504
01:10:09,538 --> 01:10:11,597
My grandfather placed it there.

505
01:10:11,707 --> 01:10:13,834
I would not risk all on folktales.

506
01:10:13,943 --> 01:10:16,207
Why did we let the others die?

507
01:10:16,312 --> 01:10:19,008
It was them or all of us.

508
01:10:20,616 --> 01:10:24,313
We sacrifice animals to survive.
Brimstone is no different.

509
01:10:24,420 --> 01:10:26,615
I will kneel before no one...

510
01:10:26,722 --> 01:10:30,283
nor will I sit here under
Vladimir's command and await death.

511
01:10:31,727 --> 01:10:35,424
I will not allow Kagan
to take away our freedom.

512
01:10:35,531 --> 01:10:37,556
The Heart will go to my father.

513
01:10:37,666 --> 01:10:42,000
And if you want to live, you will
secure the entrance until I return.

514
01:10:42,104 --> 01:10:43,867
Yes, Katarin.

515
01:12:51,300 --> 01:12:53,632
She's not coming.
It's too late.

516
01:12:53,736 --> 01:12:56,466
Have faith, Sebastian.
She will be here.

517
01:13:05,881 --> 01:13:07,405
I am here for Kagan.

518
01:13:08,617 --> 01:13:10,448
What is she doing?

519
01:13:16,125 --> 01:13:19,356
I have brought the Heart for my father.

520
01:13:19,461 --> 01:13:22,157
Give it to me.
Come on.

521
01:13:25,734 --> 01:13:28,532
You have what you want.
Now take me to Kagan.

522
01:13:28,637 --> 01:13:31,868
All in good time.
Take her.

523
01:13:34,376 --> 01:13:36,037
Well, Sebastian...

524
01:13:38,380 --> 01:13:41,315
I'm afraid there's only one way in.

525
01:13:51,126 --> 01:13:52,320
Get in!

526
01:14:18,487 --> 01:14:20,114
Master.

527
01:14:21,423 --> 01:14:24,392
The dhamphir has come to her senses
and delivered the Heart.

528
01:14:25,461 --> 01:14:27,088
Excellent.

529
01:14:29,798 --> 01:14:32,562
- Shall I bring her in?
- No, not yet.

530
01:14:34,903 --> 01:14:36,530
An historic night.

531
01:14:38,307 --> 01:14:40,241
Prepare to witness
the beginning of a new era.

532
01:14:41,810 --> 01:14:43,437
Clear the room.

533
01:14:45,681 --> 01:14:49,549
- Clear the room!
- Thralls! Forward!

534
01:14:49,651 --> 01:14:52,085
March!

535
01:15:07,302 --> 01:15:08,735
Come on!

536
01:15:19,648 --> 01:15:23,448
Capture them alive.
Take them to the dungeon.

537
01:15:23,552 --> 01:15:25,179
To the dungeon!

538
01:15:37,266 --> 01:15:40,827
There may be more. Leave them
in the cell for now and scour the castle.

539
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:46,938
The rats will be eating well tonight.

540
01:15:49,211 --> 01:15:51,771
Enjoy your stay.

541
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:56,783
And you, my dear,
you will stay here until the ceremony.

542
01:15:56,885 --> 01:16:00,286
- I know nothing of a ceremony.
- The Eye, dhamphir.

543
01:16:00,389 --> 01:16:03,085
The ceremony to extract the Eye.

544
01:16:07,462 --> 01:16:10,488
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

545
01:16:10,599 --> 01:16:12,658
It is good to know
that you are both alive.

546
01:16:12,768 --> 01:16:16,499
- I fear we're the only ones.
- What of Katarin? Is she still alive?

547
01:16:18,473 --> 01:16:22,204
If not, then she died with honor...

548
01:16:22,311 --> 01:16:24,279
fighting for her people.

549
01:16:26,648 --> 01:16:29,446
What do you know of this ceremony?

550
01:16:29,551 --> 01:16:34,147
It's an ancient vampire ritual
created to protect the talismans...

551
01:16:34,256 --> 01:16:36,019
in case they fall
into the wrong hands.

552
01:16:36,124 --> 01:16:38,183
What will come of me?

553
01:16:41,129 --> 01:16:46,192
It is only a legend
said to remove the soul.

554
01:16:54,676 --> 01:16:56,337
Listen.

555
01:17:00,515 --> 01:17:03,143
I do not know
what is going to happen to me now.

556
01:17:03,251 --> 01:17:06,015
I hope that you know
that I am not foolish enough...

557
01:17:06,121 --> 01:17:10,353
to think that I'm going
to prevail against him.

558
01:17:11,627 --> 01:17:17,156
But I do not intend
to stop fighting for a second.

559
01:17:30,646 --> 01:17:32,671
Nor will we.

560
01:17:41,089 --> 01:17:42,750
Open up.

561
01:17:42,858 --> 01:17:45,019
And bind her hands.

562
01:17:48,463 --> 01:17:50,055
It is time for the ceremony.

563
01:17:52,367 --> 01:17:53,994
Come.

564
01:17:58,774 --> 01:18:02,710
- We've got to find a way out of here.
- Well, let's get out then.

565
01:18:13,555 --> 01:18:16,115
Even in absolute defeat,
you're still not humble.

566
01:18:16,224 --> 01:18:18,590
If I'm defeated
and you're so powerful...

567
01:18:18,694 --> 01:18:21,254
then why must I be shackled
when surrounded by your thralls?

568
01:18:21,363 --> 01:18:25,129
You're still a risk. I should thank you
now that Brimstone is eradicated...

569
01:18:25,233 --> 01:18:27,133
and you have so kindly
handed me the Heart.

570
01:18:27,235 --> 01:18:29,135
I would never have believed
it would have been so easy.

571
01:18:31,239 --> 01:18:33,571
If you live through this,
which is unlikely...

572
01:18:33,675 --> 01:18:36,303
you may remain here in my castle.

573
01:18:36,411 --> 01:18:39,505
I would sooner rot in your dungeon
than sit at your table.

574
01:18:41,249 --> 01:18:43,274
So be it.

575
01:18:43,385 --> 01:18:45,751
Let us begin.

576
01:18:45,854 --> 01:18:48,687
Thrall, my companion is gone.

577
01:18:48,790 --> 01:18:51,281
I don't know
what's become of him.

578
01:18:53,061 --> 01:18:54,688
Stand back.

579
01:19:06,108 --> 01:19:08,076
Can't believe that worked.

580
01:19:17,385 --> 01:19:19,046
Savage!

581
01:19:22,090 --> 01:19:23,785
Please continue.

582
01:21:47,702 --> 01:21:49,670
This is the end of Brimstone.

583
01:22:36,952 --> 01:22:39,079
You have the Heart.
Give it to me.

584
01:22:39,187 --> 01:22:41,052
You will have to cut it from me.

585
01:22:41,156 --> 01:22:43,420
So be it.

586
01:22:55,704 --> 01:22:57,934
You're strong, Rayne,
but not skilled enough.

587
01:22:58,039 --> 01:23:00,007
Give me the Heart,
and I shall spare your life.

588
01:23:00,108 --> 01:23:03,441
I would choose death
over seeing you as my ruler.

589
01:23:03,545 --> 01:23:05,911
You're interfering with fate.
With the talismans joined...

590
01:23:06,014 --> 01:23:08,380
vampires shall rule the earth.

591
01:23:08,483 --> 01:23:10,917
As if your interests are noble.

592
01:23:13,154 --> 01:23:16,988
For centuries, we've been cursed to
the shadows, slaughtered by the fearful.

593
01:23:17,092 --> 01:23:18,992
Have you not always longed for freedom?

594
01:23:19,094 --> 01:23:21,528
You condemned me
the day you raped my mother.

595
01:23:21,629 --> 01:23:23,597
I will see she has vengeance.

596
01:23:42,050 --> 01:23:44,450
Ungrateful bitch.

597
01:24:03,671 --> 01:24:06,902
Choose to be human
and die like one.

598
01:24:28,329 --> 01:24:30,695
<i>I will find her.</i>

599
01:25:13,908 --> 01:25:16,877
- The talismans.
- I don't care. Kagan is dead.

600
01:25:16,978 --> 01:25:19,173
But what about you?

601
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:21,976
No! No, no.

602
01:25:23,818 --> 01:25:26,150
Please. Please.

603
01:25:26,254 --> 01:25:28,347
Please, you don't have to leave me.

604
01:25:28,456 --> 01:25:31,016
It's my time.

605
01:25:31,126 --> 01:25:33,117
Kagan's finished.
