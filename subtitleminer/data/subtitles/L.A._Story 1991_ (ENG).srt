00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,517
My name is Harris K. Telemacher.

2
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:55,668
I live in L.A. And I've
had seven heart attacks, all imagined.

3
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,074
I was deeply unhappy
but I didn't know it,

4
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,829
cause I was happy all the time.

5
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:15,432
I have a favorite quote about L.A.
By Shakespeare:

6
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,799
"This other Eden...

7
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,798
demi-paradise...

8
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,435
this precious stone...

9
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:26,998
set in the silver sea of this earth,
this ground... this Los Angeles.

10
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,229
Anyway, this is what happened to me,

11
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,871
and I swear, it's all true.

12
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:40,510
"Watch out L.A., it's major gridlock
out there this morning..."

13
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,156
No, no, no...

14
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:06,634
It's the perfect situation! - I can't
be in a parade. I'm in the news.

15
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:10,635
You won't see Dan Rather in a parade.
- 15 seconds to air.

16
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:15,756
What is good about waving at people?
- It's gonna make you beloved.

17
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:20,672
Waving is not what I do best. It
looks fake. - That's a great wave!

18
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,238
Look! I have to maintain my dignity.
People have to believe what I say.

19
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,514
This is news! This is truth!
...Telemacher with his report.

20
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,997
Hey, it's time for the
wac-wac-Wacky Weekend Weather!

21
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,830
Let's look at our weather map.

22
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,635
There's a low

23
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,516
coming in over Pasedna...
that's Pasadena, here,

24
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:46,949
no, there...

25
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:52,157
There were clouds here but the Council
decided against it, so there's no rain

26
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,476
in Beverly Hills.

27
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:59,677
We'll just have some sun, and snow,
and 72 and snow is what we'll have.

28
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,033
And now the car phone report.

29
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:08,430
Sunspot activity is at a minimum,
so there will be little interference.

30
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:13,192
So make that big important call.
You probably won't be disconnected.

31
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,471
And that's my report.
Gail and Bob.

32
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,199
Harris, somebody told me

33
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:24,154
you have a PhD. In Arts and
Humanities. - I do.

34
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,033
Did you a lotta good.

35
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,112
Harris, what's wacky?

36
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,715
What's wacky?

37
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:36,436
What's wacky about your last forecast?
- To me it was wacky.

38
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,030
No, not wacky.
- Not wacky?

39
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:43,792
That's we bought with you. You do
intellectual stuff. - Intellectual?

40
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,038
Maybe intellectual for you.
Because of your education.

41
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:50,597
This is an intellectual free zone!
- More wacky...

42
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:56,398
More wacky, let me make a note of
that. What was your name again?

43
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,029
We're late, aren't we?
- It's only one.

44
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,391
That's when we should be there.

45
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:11,039
I figure if I get here at 12:40,
we'll get there in plenty of time.

46
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:14,313
But I don't count on
the 20 minutes of "busyness"

47
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:17,433
that goes on after I get here.

48
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,632
I'm doing 30 minute lips.

49
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,957
Besides, they can wait.

50
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:27,758
You look so ready that I get ready
and I get up and stand by the door,

51
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:32,637
and I stand there for 10 minutes
until I realize you aren't ready.

52
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:36,038
So, I sit back down.
Then, I think you're ready again.

53
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,835
But I realize you just gave off

54
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:43,398
an illusion of being ready that I
interpreted as not being an illusion.

55
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,199
I'll be in the car.

56
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,835
Sitting there at that moment,
I thought of Shakespeare again.

57
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,198
He said, "Hey, life is pretty stupid.

58
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:03,110
Lots of hubbub to keep you busy
but really not ammounting to much."

59
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,039
Of course I'm paraphrasing.

60
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,431
"Life is a tale told by an idiot,

61
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:11,077
full of
sound and fury, signifying nothing."

62
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,115
You look nice.

63
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:35,439
Like this one better? I could change.
- No, that's all right.

64
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,191
Who are we having lunch with?

65
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:43,839
Friends and friends of friends.
And some of my gift service clients.

66
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,275
Frank will be there.
- I just saw Frank.

67
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,676
He wanted me to be in a parade.

68
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:53,999
If it weren't impossible for me
to fire people, I'd get somebody else.

69
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,433
20 minutes past one...

70
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:02,909
Hey, if you sense something
in the air, it's not the smog!

71
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,352
It's the first day of spring!

72
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,755
What did he say?

73
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,509
The first day of spring.

74
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,156
Shit!

75
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,911
Open season on the L.A. Freeway.

76
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,715
Look in the glove compartment!

77
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:22,230
Is it loaded? - It only has
two bullets. - Then load it!

78
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:25,638
Get over!
- Do bullets go bad?

79
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,992
No, no, it's not like milk! Hurry!

80
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,795
Don't point it at me!
- Sorry.

81
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,795
You son of a bitch!

82
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,914
Don't ruin our brunch!

83
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,319
Keep low!
- Ok!

84
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,273
You little cocker!

85
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,549
My hair!

86
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,629
Do you have my blue pants?
- I took them to the cleaners.

87
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,471
I'm not kissing anyone hello!

88
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:07,998
Just shake hands. - Are you
kidding? I just washed my hands!

89
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,635
Cowles, party of ten.

90
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,829
Yes, you're the first ones to arrive.

91
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,159
This way, please.

92
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,430
Hello!
- Hello! - How you doing?

93
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,039
I hurt my back playing tennis.

94
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,557
We saw them together.
- So, I see this film,

95
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,629
and I'm gonna give it an 8.
As I'm leaving the parking lot,

96
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,433
I realize the producer

97
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,031
got this great space by the entrance,

98
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,471
and they put me far away in back.

99
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,239
So I gave it a three.

100
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,435
Good for you.

101
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,235
Sheila is studying
the art of conversation.

102
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,478
You're taking a course
in conversation? - Yes.

103
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,915
I teach my clients the point system.

104
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:19,670
You should never have more than
7 points. Earrings are 2 points.

105
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,553
Those daisies are 3.

106
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,309
Before you go out,

107
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:28,912
look in the mirror. The first thing
that catches your eye has to go.

108
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,913
I had this thing in my hair before.
And I pulled it right out.

109
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,955
Marilyn Monroe did that.
- Don't get dumped

110
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:41,153
in L.A. In New York
you can meet someone on the street.

111
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:46,230
Here you have to hit someone in your
car. Some girls speed to meet cops.

112
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,036
We met on a hit in West Hollywood.

113
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:02,798
Loud talkers in restaurants.
I despise them and I want them to die.

114
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,315
Sara's here.

115
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,272
Shoot them like dogs.

116
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,916
I thought you were lost!

117
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,078
Let me sit you down.

118
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,158
This is Sara McDowel.

119
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:30,912
Harris, Trudy. - Frank Swan.
- Shawn. - How do you do?

120
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,396
...Cynthia.
Sara was just in London.

121
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:34,875
You must be exhausted.

122
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:38,153
It's nothing that some sleep and
a good fuck wouldn't cure,

123
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,318
as my sister used to say.

124
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,715
You have to forgive Sara.
- I'm sorry, it was a

125
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,275
figure of speech.

126
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,355
I've been on a plane for 12 hours.

127
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:57,876
What do you give the flight?
- What? - On a scale of 1 to 10.

128
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,590
An eight.

129
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,477
What would you like to eat?

130
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,876
What kind of food do they have?

131
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,879
California Cuisine!

132
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,632
And these damn wrong number dialers.
What the hell do we do about them?

133
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,877
Sara, what do you do?
- I'm here writing

134
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,958
about L.A. For the "London Times."

135
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,755
You've come to the right place.

136
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,320
What do you do, Rollie?
- I deal in English paintings.

137
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:29,514
Abstract or Realistic?
- Depends on how you look at them.

138
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,835
What's this?

139
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,755
It's an earthquake.
How strong is it, Harris?

140
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,238
I give it a 4.

141
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,473
When a business person needs a gift,

142
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,753
I go and pick something appropriate.

143
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,679
I gifted the entire

144
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,429
Sherman law firm last Christmas.

145
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:04,599
Sherman, I recieved something
from them, a stun gun!

146
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,632
That was me!

147
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,634
Did you get it monogrammed?

148
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,236
She ought to interview Harry Zell.
- Who's Harry Zell?

149
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:22,038
The most powerful agent in town.
- Beyond powerful. The miracle worker.

150
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:23,829
He's supposed to be nice.

151
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,954
He would never stab you in the back.

152
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,110
Napkin?

153
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,830
I think I'm a grown-up, but I'm not.

154
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:45,632
I'll have a de-caf coffee.
- De-caf espresso. - Cappuccino.

155
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:50,835
Do you have de-caf coffee ice cream?
- I'll have a de-caf double half caf.

156
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:55,632
I'll have a twist of lemon.
- Me, too. - Me, too. - Me, too.

157
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,991
I would love to do a make-over on you.

158
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,953
I hope your nose turns out.

159
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,870
As far as I'm concerned, there are
three mystical places in the world.

160
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,830
The desert outside Santa Fe,

161
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:11,033
the tree of life
in the Arab emirates of Bahrain,

162
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,114
and the restaurant
at Sunset and Crescent.

163
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:18,519
Because that's
where I first met her and touched her.

164
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,877
Wasn't that girl, Sara, awful?

165
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:29,431
What's with that accent?
- It's because she's English.

166
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:34,510
Or she's trying to impress everybody.
- Like that big phoney, Churchill.

167
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,191
About what you said...
- What?

168
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:41,632
About sleep, and having a boff.
- Listen, if I say that

169
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:45,197
sort of thing again,
tie me up and gag me.

170
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:48,438
We tried that once,
but you started laughing.

171
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:51,030
Leave off alone, there's a dicker.

172
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,754
You've come all this way.
We really should give it another try.

173
00:15:56,200 --> 00:16:00,159
But I'm happy the way things are.
I'm getting my life sorted out.

174
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:05,879
I'm so passionate about you. Let me
take you for a hot dog on Sunday.

175
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:10,233
Your ticket, please.
- It's the cream thingy, there.

176
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:14,035
It's late. I've got to go.

177
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:23,637
And she kept her hat on all through
brunch. I'm sure she has bad hair.

178
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:27,152
You don't know how unattractive
hate is. - Excuse me!

179
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,271
Hello!

180
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:32,600
Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

181
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,837
When do people here get up?

182
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,838
It depends. Why?

183
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:43,188
When can a person start making noise?
- What kind of noise?

184
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:47,758
Like construction?
- No, like deep sustained booms.

185
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:51,237
Deep sustained booms...
Around 9 or 9: 15.

186
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,512
Great. Thanks. Bye.

187
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,231
She's used to driving on the left.

188
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:28,318
I'm sorry. I was... I was just
concentrating on... - I know what.

189
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,272
Do you like those?
- Yes...

190
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,153
Sorry, what?
- Your pants.

191
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,478
Shall I mark them for you?
- I don't know. Are these

192
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:20,151
the same price as these others?
- A little more.

193
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,833
How do I look in these?

194
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,836
You look... fabulous!

195
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,919
Okay, mark them.

196
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:40,550
You have to stand up straight,
or they won't be right. - Ok.

197
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,117
Do you like a break in them?
- A little.

198
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:45,950
Like that?

199
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,708
That's fine.

200
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,315
When's pick-up?

201
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:03,715
Just about anytime you want.
Wednesday all right?

202
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,434
Yeah, fine.

203
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,869
I'll just slip out of these.

204
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:31,753
There are two events in my life
that I consider magical,

205
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,589
that couldn't
be explained scientifically.

206
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,438
The first of them was about to happen.

207
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:19,915
Hi.

208
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,035
Ruok?

209
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,635
Are you okay?

210
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:32,589
Oh, "Are you okay?" Yeah, I'm fine.

211
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,235
- What?

212
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,669
Who are you?

213
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,994
I can see that.

214
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:51,955
I'm being filmed, I know.
I'm being filmed.

215
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,428
All right.

216
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:08,634
- Is this a joke or something?

217
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,158
How am I in trouble?

218
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,357
So, what do I do?

219
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,669
What?

220
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,634
- Oh, do it again!

221
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:51,354
Well, I'll work on it.

222
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,839
Bye, bye.

223
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,436
The sign spoke to me.

224
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,357
It said I was in trouble.
- If you talked to a sign, you are.

225
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:23,273
So I'll see you Sunday?
- I got a shower Sunday.

226
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,992
Yeah, I should take a bath. Monday?

227
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,637
Pick me up at 8:30.
- 8:30? No one eats at six anymore?

228
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:40,911
Quiet! Quiet! It's me, quiet!

229
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,036
Will you be quiet!

230
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,237
I don't need a key.

231
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,596
Who's daddy?

232
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,958
An entire block in North Hollywood

233
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,631
had to be evacuated today,
cause of a shower of tennis balls.

234
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,229
It seems the cargo...

235
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:33,750
Ready.

236
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,509
Mom!
- Say name again.

237
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:43,038
What a surprise this weekend when
the weather turned unseasonably low.

238
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:46,278
Here's our wacky weatherman
with a report.

239
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:47,954
When the weather

240
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:52,435
dropped down to 58 this weekend,
how did you cope?

241
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,677
We just shut all the windows.

242
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,554
And what about your pets?

243
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,878
The cats were out until around 10:00

244
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,356
but it got too cold and they came in.

245
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:08,113
The cats were out until 10:00 but
it got too cold and they came in.

246
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,438
That's how L.A. Coped with

247
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,429
that low of 58 that made
the weekend a real weenie shrinker.

248
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:15,676
Thank you.

249
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,198
And now, the toupee report.

250
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:23,997
Winds 5 to 10 miles an hour,
gusting to 15 in the late afternoon.

251
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:27,069
So stay indoors, or wear a hat!

252
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:28,715
This is Harris K. Telemacher

253
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,879
with the wiggy weekend weather.

254
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,278
Hello, this is Harris.
Please start talking at the beep.

255
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,429
Hello?
- Hello.

256
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,591
Is this a person?
- Yes.

257
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,958
Harris Telemacher?
- Yes.

258
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,192
This is Sara McDowel. We met at lunch?

259
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,598
Yeah, you're the reporter.
- Journalist.

260
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,996
And you're the weatherman.

261
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,512
Meteorologist.
- I just got

262
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:15,317
your number from Trudi Cowles.
I want to interview you for my piece.

263
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,833
English, French, or Italian?

264
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:21,955
You speak all those languages?
- No, just English.

265
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,675
Bugger!

266
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:27,836
Ready.

267
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,038
Dial Mom.

268
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:37,237
Domino's Pizza, this is Julian...
- Sorry, sorry...

269
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:01,039
Want some trail mix? Fruit? Cookies?

270
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:03,630
How do you stay so thin?

271
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,833
Maybe women burn fat faster than men.

272
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,633
That's disguisting.

273
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:12,595
That's my friend,
smart, pretty, and quite a fat burner.

274
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,519
You're just jealous.
- I don't know.

275
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:18,555
I couldn't be a woman because
I'd play with my breasts all day.

276
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,959
Where's June? - Upstairs,
recovering from the alcohol.

277
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,432
Want some juice?
- Sure.

278
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:28,235
Be my taster, it's a new mixture.

279
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,035
This is Ariel.

280
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,228
Hey, what's up?

281
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,878
That's a job for Supergirl.

282
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:41,629
It's like licking a shag carpet!

283
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,230
I'll bring it down in an hour.

284
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:49,029
Can we take your car
so I can leave mine for June. - Sure.

285
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,630
Today will be rough. There's coffee.

286
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:58,632
Hey, Harris. God, was I stupid...
- Have some juice.

287
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,589
I'll make you some eggs.

288
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:04,430
Can you hold on a sec?
- The Museum is open till five.

289
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,313
I keep busy this way.

290
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:02,230
I call it performance art,
but Ariel calls it wasting time.

291
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,911
History will decide.

292
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:23,231
You're on time.
- I'm late. - You're right on time.

293
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:26,069
But I had planned on being early.

294
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,394
Don't! Stop! Let me pose at least.

295
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,513
Listen, I had this idea,

296
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,678
rather than an...
- Hang on.

297
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:40,634
Rather than do an interview, which
would be fascinating because of the

298
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,433
interesting words I use,

299
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,836
I'd rather show you around town.

300
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:48,636
You know,
a kind of cultural tour of L.A.

301
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:51,116
That's the
first fifteen minutes, then what?

302
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:52,675
A cynic.

303
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,156
First stop is six blocks.
- Why don't we walk?

304
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:56,829
Walk?

305
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,438
A walk in L.A.?

306
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:05,436
Architecture. Some of these buildings

307
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,359
are over 20 years old!

308
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:11,839
This house is Greek revival. The
Greek owner must be revived every day.

309
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,754
Here's a Tudor mansion.
And a four door mansion.

310
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:21,432
You're nobody in L.A. Unless
you live in a house with a big door.

311
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:24,190
Let's go the Museum of Musicology.

312
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:27,839
Verdi's baton.

313
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,632
Mozart's quill.

314
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,354
Beethoven's balls.

315
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:45,072
I'll take you to the graveyard.
Lots of famous people

316
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:49,308
are buried here.
Rocky Marciano, Benny Goodman, and

317
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,034
William Shakespeare.

318
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,234
I think he wrote "Hamlet" Part 8

319
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,033
"The Revenge," here.

320
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,149
Whose grave is this?

321
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:13,635
Mine.
- No,

322
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,832
who'll be buried here? His name?

323
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:18,191
It's not a he.
- Ok, she.

324
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,868
Not a woman either.

325
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,398
Used to be a woman, now she's dead.

326
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,468
A funny gravedigger.

327
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:29,718
Wanna know how long it takes
a body to rot? - Boy, do we!

328
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,355
Well, if they're not already

329
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:36,270
rotten, 8 or 9 years.
The Beverly Hills women can last 12.

330
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:42,078
How come? - Their skin is so tanned.
It's all stretched and polished up.

331
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:46,195
That'll keep the water out,
and water's what ruins a dead body.

332
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:50,758
And they have them extra parts.
That stuff's not biodegradable.

333
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,590
This bloke's been here 35 years.

334
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,029
Who was he?

335
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,879
The magician, Blunderman.

336
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:01,311
Not so great now, is he?

337
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,432
I knew him.

338
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:11,199
He was funny. He taught me magic.

339
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,795
A fellow of infinite jest...
- Yeah. - That's it.

340
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:19,515
He hath borne me
on his back a thousand times.

341
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,678
She knows, she's got it.

342
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,758
Where be your gibes now?

343
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:28,157
Your merriment
that would set the table on a roar?

344
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:36,276
Interesting people usually make me
feel like I have to be interesting.

345
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,199
Am I interesting?

346
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:42,554
When I'm around you,
I find myself showing off,

347
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,639
which is the
idiot's version of being interesting.

348
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:49,351
Are you seeing anyone now?

349
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:55,309
Yeah.
- Me, too. So that's sort of out.

350
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,391
Can I have your friend's head back?

351
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,193
Sure. Sorry.

352
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:05,349
I should get to work.
- Me, too.

353
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:13,154
Come back, they all do! Don't they?

354
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:18,636
What a weekend! We have sun, earth,
and atmosphere, so we have weather!

355
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:22,436
Not weather, sun, sun, sun, sun, sun!

356
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,154
It will...

357
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,711
My watch! Turn off the magnet!

358
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,631
I've got it!

359
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,990
Okay... Turn off the magnet!

360
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,793
Now, the financial report.

361
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:40,630
'89 Mercedes
up 400 dollars at 28,640...

362
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:45,232
used '88 Mercedes,
unchanged at 26, 100 dollars.

363
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,639
And... cut.

364
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,192
Ok, let's see what we've got.

365
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:55,076
You'll run that on Saturday?
- Pretaping the weather?

366
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:59,035
Coming in on weekends is tough.
My busy weekend schedule.

367
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,596
It's L. A, what's gonna change?

368
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:20,679
There are two reasons
for the detour I was embarking on.

369
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:22,275
See you tomorrow!

370
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:27,836
Are you closed?
- Yeah, sorry.

371
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,831
First, I believed the relationship

372
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,032
with Sara was impossible.

373
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:40,237
The second reason was,
I was a big dumb male.

374
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,432
I came to pick up pants.

375
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,835
You sold me some pants and a tie.

376
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:50,238
I remember. You wanna pick them up?
- Yeah.

377
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:55,915
I can get them. - I wouldn't have to
come back. - That wouldn't be so bad.

378
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,588
I don't have my ticket.

379
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:01,589
I remember what they look like.
I'll be right back.

380
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,109
I'm getting all wet.

381
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,073
I'll be right back.

382
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:18,231
They're not ready yet.
We'll call you. What's the number?

383
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:20,238
I'll write it.

384
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,634
You got paper?

385
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,708
Ok, we'll call you when they're ready.

386
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,678
Expecting a call?

387
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,430
Were you shocked?
- Shocked but glad.

388
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:33,634
I could tell you wanted my number,
so I just asked for yours.

389
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:36,469
I didn't know, until it was too late.

390
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:40,037
I went to this psychic once,

391
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:44,234
and he told me I had
this special fifth sense about things.

392
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:46,159
About guys?

393
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:49,797
Any guy would want your number.
- That's sweet.

394
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,355
Weather guy!

395
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,233
How you doing?

396
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,952
I'm nervous here.

397
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,356
You're not doing anything wrong.

398
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:03,039
You must have a boyfriend?
- He doesn't care. He can't care.

399
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:07,029
He gave me this big speech,
how even though we live together,

400
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:08,635
we should be able

401
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:11,435
to see other people. I said ok, but

402
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,752
it backfires on him sometimes.

403
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,349
Where is he now?

404
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,679
He's at the bar.

405
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,150
What?

406
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,318
This was his idea.

407
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:22,875
This is him!

408
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,228
Do you want my number?

409
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,231
No, no! That would be a disaster.
Then I might call you.

410
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:38,639
It's 5-5-5-2-3-1-2. Say it back!
- No, I don't want to know it.

411
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:42,231
5-5-5-2...
- Stop it! You'll make me memorize it!

412
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:44,352
5-5-5...

413
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:48,236
2-3-1-2.
- Geez, now I know it. 5-5-5...

414
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,033
2-3-1-2.

415
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:53,669
Your name again?

416
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:59,033
It's nice
but everybody has weird names now,

417
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:03,359
like Tiffany with p-h-i,
and instead of Nancy it's Nanceen.

418
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:07,156
Big S and D, two E's, second one big.
- What?

419
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,875
S-a-n-D-e-E. And a star at the end.

420
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,271
I called you when I got out of class.

421
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:54,757
What class are you taking?
- For spokesmodeling.

422
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,509
What is a spokesmodel?
- Just a model

423
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:02,238
who speaks, and she
points at things like merchandise,

424
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:07,310
like a car or washer and dryer,
or a book or fine art prints.

425
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:10,991
They have classes for that?
- It's harder than it looks.

426
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:15,069
I'll be your robber today.
- How are you? - How long is class?

427
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:18,239
About three hours.
- What made you want to do that?

428
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:20,238
Well, I always like pointing.

429
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:25,237
So, why won't you sleep with me?
- With my ex-husband?

430
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:26,954
It happens all the time.

431
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:30,631
It might be just like it was.
- That would be terrible.

432
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:36,233
Come on, we're a perfect match.
- Because our mothers hunt together?

433
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:39,638
For God's sake,
your mother shot my mother!

434
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:42,236
Someone fell, it was an accident.

435
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,159
You're the only normal one,

436
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,033
and you're barely hanging on.

437
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:49,233
Remember when your mom found out
whose dog was crapping in front of

438
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:52,956
your house and she put their name
on paper in the center of the pile?

439
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:56,915
These are not things grown-ups do!
I'm the only sane thing in your life.

440
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,354
Yes, possibly.
- I want you back.

441
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:04,236
I'll cook and sew for you.
Just give me one weekend.

442
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,836
We can see how it is.

443
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,233
Will you come?

444
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:15,875
I went roller skating once
at the Brooklyn Rollerdome.

445
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:20,229
It was awful.
I was completely out of control.

446
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:26,550
I went slamming into this 8-foot tall
black guy in a green satin jump suit.

447
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:30,431
I said, "I'm sorry, could you
help me?" And he looked at me

448
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:36,034
with stoned eyes and said: "Let your
mind go and your body will follow."

449
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:47,435
Well, how was that?

450
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,436
It was very nice, thanks.

451
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:58,436
I hope I wasn't too young in my
thinking for you. - What? - Joke.

452
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:03,831
I don't pressure you, do I?
- No. I don't pressure you, do I?

453
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:07,033
No, there shouldn't be any.
- Tell me if I do.

454
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:09,436
Ok, and you tell me if I do.

455
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:14,432
You ever had a high colonic?

456
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,836
Pardon me?
- A high colonic.

457
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,836
You mean an enema?
- Yeah.

458
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:22,639
Is this a joke?

459
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:27,198
They're great. They purify you.
They do it in a place in Santa Monica.

460
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:29,029
They're great.

461
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:33,229
Is this where you live?
- Yeah, here.

462
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,238
It's really groovy.

463
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:40,555
Well...

464
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:42,395
Good night.

465
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,029
Good night.

466
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,037
Take me off that speakerphone!
- Relax.

467
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:18,278
It's just a modern day device.
- I have to see you.

468
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,233
You were out last night?
- Yeah.

469
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:24,036
There was no shower?
- I didn't go at the last minute.

470
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:29,829
Having sex with my agent. I told you
a thousand... - How did you know?

471
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:34,510
I was right? I was right?

472
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:40,430
I was making a bad joke.
My agent, Frank?

473
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,632
And this is how I find out?

474
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:47,119
You tell me?
- We just decided I should tell you.

475
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:51,476
I thought he only took ten percent.
- We were here.

476
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,231
Then...
- After he made love to you, what?

477
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:57,238
We went to the Hard Rock Cafe.

478
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:58,829
What time?

479
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:01,431
I don't know... 11:00 or 11:30.

480
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:05,552
I felt I had to tell you
in case anyone saw us there.

481
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:07,839
It was a dumb thing to do.

482
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:09,554
How long has this gone on?

483
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:14,031
Three years.
- Three years! - I'm sorry.

484
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,030
This has gone on since the 80's?

485
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:25,590
I'm sorry.
I just can't be here right now.

486
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:43,955
I'm out of my relationship,
I'm out of the agency!

487
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,675
And I only looked
like a fool for 3 years!

488
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:49,472
Now, if I could get out of weather.

489
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,518
Will you stop predicting things!

490
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:58,039
Have you always been a freeway sign?

491
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:02,029
Or did you start as a stop sign
and work your way up from there?

492
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:05,479
I BELI EVE I USED TO BE A BAGPI PE

493
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:08,589
Oh, alright.

494
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:19,669
- Would you stop predicting then?

495
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:21,838
- Yes.

496
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:29,154
So I pretape the weather

497
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:31,033
and some sailors lost their boats.

498
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:34,233
Big deal! Besides, what kind of

499
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:39,117
asshole sailor would trust the
wacky weatherman anyway? - This one.

500
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:40,913
You lost your boat?
- Yes.

501
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:42,475
You're fired.

502
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:44,638
I never want to see you.

503
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:50,711
I said I never want to see you.
You're fired.

504
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:59,040
The weather
will change your life, twice.

505
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:02,039
That's once.

506
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:07,236
You and Trudy broke up?
I knew your relationship was a "two."

507
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:13,435
If love is ruining your day,

508
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:16,792
it's always good to
ruin your best friend's day, too.

509
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:25,238
Trudi wasn't for me. The only fun
we had was sex and watching TV.

510
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:28,189
Good turn.
- I hate to say this,

511
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:30,312
but if sex and watching

512
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:34,753
TV are fun, you really got something.
- What happened to my plant?

513
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:38,991
Is anybody else out there?

514
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:42,557
There is, but it's impossible.
- Does she like you?

515
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:46,033
I don't know.

516
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:48,516
Just call this Sandy girl.

517
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:50,712
At least you could take her out.

518
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:57,396
Thanks a lot, it was great!

519
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:04,193
What do you think?

520
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:08,799
I think it was a total washout.
- It really clears out your head.

521
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:13,028
Head? You should go back in there
and tell them they're doing it wrong.

522
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:17,031
It was a great lunch and enema.

523
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:21,033
You gonna see me again?
- Sure, if you want to.

524
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:24,189
When?
- Friday. Friday okay?

525
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:26,957
Yeah.
- Where do you wanna go?

526
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:29,835
There's this new restaurant...

527
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:35,432
..."L'ldiot." - I've heard of that.
"L'ldiot," you and me on Friday.

528
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,075
Hello, "L'ldiot..."

529
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:40,431
Reservation for two for Friday.

530
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:44,629
Saturday?

531
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:50,439
Sunday? Good... 8:30?

532
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:53,438
5:30 or 10:30?

533
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:55,835
Um, 5:30.

534
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,035
Visa.

535
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:01,156
I'm a weatherman.

536
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:03,033
Yes, I'm on TV.

537
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:05,634
Renting.

538
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:08,191
I just sold a condo!

539
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:10,631
Yes, in this soft market!

540
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:14,036
That's none of your business.

541
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:17,036
In the low fifties.

542
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:20,038
I can meet you at 3:00.

543
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:23,952
I have Visa and Mastercard.

544
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:26,436
They all have both.

545
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:30,634
Mr. Pardeau is looking for
more than a promise to pay.

546
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:33,753
He's looking for a kind of depth

547
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:35,997
in your financial sea.

548
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:40,357
Let's make this easier.
Suppose you get

549
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:43,075
the reservation and suppose

550
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:45,988
you come down and we honor it.

551
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:50,229
What might you order?

552
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:56,558
I might like the duck.

553
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,070
You can't.
- You can't.

554
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:03,149
Why? - With this financial statement,
you think you can have the duck?

555
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:07,837
Where do you summer?

556
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:09,555
Excuse me?

557
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,753
Where do you spend your summers?

558
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:16,035
Here.

559
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:19,348
The chicken.
- You can have the chichen.

560
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:21,631
What about my date?

561
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:24,719
You can urge her in one direction.

562
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:31,440
Either we go there and she orders
what she wants or let's forget it.

563
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:39,354
Alright.

564
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:41,313
I like a little gamble.

565
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:43,159
We can take you...

566
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:46,548
in eight weeks.

567
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:50,280
Sandy,
I heard bad things about "L'ldiot".

568
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:55,635
And I went down there and the chef
had a big open sore on his lip.

569
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:59,951
I know, I know, I did.
I'm really sorry.

570
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:04,992
What if we went away for the weekend,
like Santa Barbara?

571
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:10,160
Roland thinks
L.A. Is for the braindead.

572
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:13,956
He says if the sprinklers stopped
you'd have a desert.

573
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:15,833
But I think...

574
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:19,234
I don't know.
It's not what I expected.

575
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:24,392
It's where they've taken the desert
and turned it into their dreams.

576
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:34,278
I think it's also a place of secrets.

577
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:37,632
Secret houses, lives, pleasures...

578
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:39,718
And no one is looking

579
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:43,232
for verification
that what they're doing is ok.

580
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:48,638
What do you say, Roland?

581
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:51,876
It's a place for the braindead.

582
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:54,591
Why do you have to be so snotty?

583
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:57,630
I think you're being superior.

584
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:01,558
I've met some
pretty intelligent people here.

585
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:19,828
I'm sorry...

586
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:26,834
This is
one of the people I spoke about.

587
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:29,874
Harris Telemacher, Roland Mackey.
You met at lunch.

588
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:32,436
Have you tried the Guggenheim?
- I get that.

589
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:35,952
Because it's circular and downhill.
- I got it.

590
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:41,471
Ariel, this is Roland Mackey
and Sara McDowel.

591
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:44,879
I loved your TV bit.
- I loved yours, too.

592
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:46,878
But...
- I can...

593
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:49,880
Oh I see. - It's a...
- You're very funny.

594
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:53,073
You have a lot of verve.

595
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:55,755
Verve?

596
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:59,113
Want to walk with us?

597
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:04,435
I like the relationships.
Each character has his own story.

598
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:09,032
The puppy is a bit too much,
but you have to overlook that.

599
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:14,153
The way he's holding her,
it's almost... filthy.

600
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:19,436
He's about to kiss her
and she's pulling away...

601
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:23,511
The way
his leg is smashed up against her...

602
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:29,038
Look how he's painted the blouse,
sort of translucent,

603
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:33,109
you can make out her breast,
and it's sort of touching him...

604
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:36,677
It's really pretty torrid,
don't you think?

605
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:42,229
And of course you have the onlookers
peeking out like they're all shocked.

606
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:44,439
They wish.

607
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:50,036
I must admit, when I see a painting
like this, I get emotionally...

608
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:51,595
Erect.

609
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:08,600
Those paintings of food got me hungry.
- I could eat some paintings of food.

610
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:11,628
It was fun.

611
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:15,834
It was lovely to meet you.
- Great running into you.

612
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:21,836
What were you doing in there?
- That's the girl I like.

613
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:26,029
You've really blown it.
- Let's all go out for dinner.

614
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:32,473
I've heard of meeting accidentally and
going to dinner, but I never did it.

615
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:35,873
He loves me. - Everyone does.
- "L'ldiot"?

616
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:40,108
I've heard of that place.
- We'll never get in, it's impossible.

617
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:43,438
There's a phone.
- Suit yourself.

618
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:48,039
I can't go. Could they take you home?
- I don't want to impose.

619
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:52,268
It's no problem. We got two cars.
- Ariel, are you coming?

620
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:54,631
I can't.
- Dinner for three.

621
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:59,631
It's all set. How should we do this?
- Why doesn't he come with me?

622
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:03,313
I know where it is and she doesn't

623
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:08,038
so I could tell her where it was,
otherwise we'd end up drawing a map,

624
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:12,598
unless I drove your car
and you went with her...

625
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:15,031
Is Roland your boyfriend?
- No, just friends.

626
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:20,349
That's good. I mean it's fine
that I can drive with you.

627
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:25,551
Right side! Get on the right side!

628
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:32,156
I don't think he can hear you.

629
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:01,996
Your usual table, Mr. Christopher?
- No, a good one.

630
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:03,759
That is impossible.

631
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,877
Part of the new cruelty?
- Yes.

632
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:09,038
Table 253.

633
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:12,069
What do you want?

634
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:13,999
Want our specials?

635
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:18,353
I'm gonna tell you
what we got to eat,

636
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:22,839
we got primavera pasta,
and six different kinds of meat!

637
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:26,072
Wow, I'm done already.

638
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:29,830
"We got spicy guacamole

639
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:31,838
and brie quesadilla,

640
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:35,875
we got goat cheese pizza
on a blue corn tortilla..."

641
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:37,753
Floss?

642
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:40,668
I'll have floss.
- Diet or regular? - Regular.

643
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:44,669
"We got hot bread,
milk-fed veal and new potatoes,

644
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:46,872
we got a hundred different ways

645
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:49,959
to cook a couple of tomatoes."

646
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:58,275
I'll take you home.
- What?

647
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:01,992
I live near you. I'll take you.
- The cars are here.

648
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:05,432
I can take him. He lives near me.
- Are you sure?

649
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:10,032
Yeah, no problem.
- That's good, I live in the valley.

650
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:17,040
I should take a cab. The drive over
was a bit risky. - C'mon, get in.

651
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:21,034
Promise me you'll see me this weekend?

652
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:24,712
I will. I promise.

653
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:27,828
See you at the weekend.

654
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:34,633
Right side!

655
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:52,110
It was fun.
- Yes, it was.

656
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:55,479
I like Roland.

657
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:59,629
Yes, he's nice, isn't he?
- Yeah, it's interesting that you

658
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:01,718
can have a relationship

659
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:03,718
that's more friendly

660
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:05,593
than sexual.

661
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:11,349
So... Good night.

662
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:26,513
Car's rolling!

663
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:29,230
It's locked!
- It's locked here, too!

664
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:34,959
Where are the keys? - In the ignition.
- How did the car get locked?

665
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:38,631
I didn't lock it!
- We gotta stop it from rolling.

666
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:42,834
Are we on a hill?
- Yeah, but it's sloped the other way!

667
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:45,510
I got it!
- I got it!

668
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:59,874
I think I know what this is.

669
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:02,433
Get in!
- What?

670
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:06,037
It's alright.
You can trust me. Go ahead, get in!

671
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:13,232
It's alright. Stay in!

672
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:18,755
I think we're fine. Don't paw me!

673
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:23,834
Get over here!
Let me not drive! - Why?

674
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:38,670
This is the sign I told you about.

675
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:40,838
What is it?

676
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:43,390
I think I figured out the car.

677
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:46,992
I read an article in the Times...

678
00:57:58,080 --> 00:57:59,513
...electrical currents...

679
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:19,430
My head hurts.

680
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:23,156
I think I should go.

681
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:36,831
Do you want to come in?

682
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:39,314
Why?

683
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:43,879
Yeah... sorry.
We're moving too fast.

684
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:49,511
But we should see each other again.
- Yes.

685
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:52,239
I suppose.

686
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:57,834
What's today?
- Thursday.

687
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:00,833
The weekend?

688
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:07,433
I'm supposed to see my ex
this weekend. I'm sorry.

689
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:10,675
I promised. It's a deal.

690
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:14,237
I've got a few things to do, also.

691
00:59:15,560 --> 00:59:16,754
My mother

692
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:19,476
has a bridge luncheon...

693
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:24,155
I'm supposed to go
to a fund-raising dinner tomorrow.

694
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:26,158
It's formal, you know...

695
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:28,830
but I thought to take you would be...

696
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:31,309
fantastic.

697
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:34,513
Not a date, just a do.
Are you interested?

698
00:59:35,320 --> 00:59:37,550
Alright.
- Alright? - Yes.

699
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,991
So I'll take that as a "yes."

700
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:48,799
It's wonderful you see your mother.
That reminds me, I should call mine.

701
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:53,029
Yeah, you got your ex,
and I got that whole bridge thing.

702
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:08,233
Hello... Mom?
- Hello, darling. How are you?

703
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:09,476
I'm fine.

704
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:12,150
Are you busy?
- I'm making 56

705
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:15,239
papier-mache hats.
- Do you want to play?

706
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:18,035
Always, darling. The usual?

707
01:00:58,560 --> 01:01:00,630
Night-night, mom.
- Night, darling.

708
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:58,031
You play the tuba?
- No.

709
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:02,635
I used to. But not now.
I mean, I was before you arrived.

710
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:04,433
I did.

711
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:06,633
I forgot something.

712
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:12,029
Ready.

713
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:16,829
Are you alright?
- Yeah, I'm just going out too much.

714
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:22,197
When you go out too much,
you feel like you never stay home.

715
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:25,598
Are you upset about last night?
- No, I understand.

716
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:28,838
My car rolled,
then your tongue was in my mouth.

717
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:33,671
That was a lozenge. - My mouth
shouldn't accept lozenges right now.

718
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:38,633
You're passionate.
You just keep denying it.

719
01:02:39,080 --> 01:02:41,310
Just relax and give in to it.

720
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:43,438
You don't.
- What?

721
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:47,634
I can hardly contain myself
when I'm around you. I go crazy

722
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:50,036
when I see you.
- That's the trouble.

723
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:53,472
You're rollerskating, amusing
yourself, your friends, and me.

724
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:56,229
It's just a lot of noise.
- What?

725
01:02:56,680 --> 01:03:01,356
I mean, we all try to prevent
getting hurt. That's how you do it.

726
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:03,199
Should we just forget it then?

727
01:03:03,640 --> 01:03:06,313
If that's what you want, fine.
- Fine.

728
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:09,479
Full service or self service?
- Full, Tony.

729
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:28,312
And I knew

730
01:03:28,760 --> 01:03:34,676
it was a great project.
If the city were willing

731
01:03:35,120 --> 01:03:38,908
to partially finance
my private museum. It would be

732
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:45,719
a great bonus for the people.
And so...

733
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:47,195
I met with Ron.

734
01:03:49,240 --> 01:03:50,195
Ron...

735
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:53,232
I toast you.

736
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:55,113
Are you alright?

737
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:57,636
I just feel a little dizzy.

738
01:03:59,080 --> 01:04:01,435
I should get some air, I'm nauseous.

739
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:05,392
I'll take him out.

740
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:11,038
And Ron felt like I did.

741
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:15,119
What's the matter?
- I don't know.

742
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:19,235
Something in my stomach
or my head or my heart or...

743
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:21,238
Can I do anything?

744
01:04:24,520 --> 01:04:26,988
I can't, this is how Mummy met Daddy.

745
01:04:28,320 --> 01:04:30,675
Let your mind go
and your will follow.

746
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:54,511
And now let us all move forward
with great enthusiasm

747
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:58,350
to build the greatest
private museum in the world.

748
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:08,796
Are you feeling any better?
- Much better, thanks.

749
01:05:09,240 --> 01:05:10,434
Yes, thanks.

750
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:23,434
We didn't know what to say
so we wandered down Melrose

751
01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:28,237
and had the kind of small talk
necessary to cover what had happened.

752
01:05:28,680 --> 01:05:31,831
The station wants to try serious news

753
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:35,511
with me as the anchor.
No laughing or chit-chatting.

754
01:05:36,680 --> 01:05:40,195
So there I was
jabbering about my new job,

755
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:42,039
about anything at all.

756
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:44,392
But all I thought was:

757
01:05:44,920 --> 01:05:48,754
Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful...

758
01:07:12,920 --> 01:07:16,037
Who wrote the "Tonight Show" theme?

759
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:20,633
Where will we stay?

760
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:25,917
Don't bounce. I came to tell you

761
01:07:26,360 --> 01:07:28,316
that I can't go away with you.

762
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,514
I've been seeing someone, and it

763
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:37,428
wouldn't be good to go away with you.

764
01:07:37,880 --> 01:07:39,438
I'm really sorry.

765
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:43,635
So, you're seeing her this weekend?

766
01:07:44,080 --> 01:07:48,835
No, she's got this obligation
to her ex, to see if it can work.

767
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:51,431
She's seeing someone else?
- Yes.

768
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:53,632
She's going away with him.

769
01:07:55,320 --> 01:07:57,231
Share how that makes you feel.

770
01:07:57,680 --> 01:08:00,638
Share? Share? It drives me crazy!

771
01:08:01,080 --> 01:08:04,152
I mean, especially since
I've been working out!

772
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:06,397
Look at the effort I put in!

773
01:08:06,840 --> 01:08:11,356
But it's fair, since she had
this obligation before we even met.

774
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:16,237
But you had this obligation.
Why should you suffer all weekend?

775
01:08:18,120 --> 01:08:19,838
No.
- Go away with me.

776
01:08:20,280 --> 01:08:23,875
I can't. I would just be
using you to get even with her.

777
01:08:24,320 --> 01:08:25,878
I don't mind.
- Let's go.

778
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:31,428
We should be there
in an hour and half.

779
01:08:31,880 --> 01:08:35,998
I booked at the "El Pollo del Mar".
- Beautiful. Wave to Jack! Bye.

780
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:40,192
A million stars! And the beach...

781
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:43,837
I want to spin on the beach.
- They have a special beach for that.

782
01:08:44,280 --> 01:08:50,037
And I don't think we should make love.
- Ok, we'll just have sex.

783
01:08:53,960 --> 01:08:58,431
What was Sam Spade's partner's name?
- Archer.

784
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:02,714
We might meet people at the Ysidero,

785
01:09:03,160 --> 01:09:05,037
I put us in the "El Pollo del Mar".

786
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:08,439
I'm really excited!

787
01:09:12,360 --> 01:09:13,634
Me too.

788
01:09:19,240 --> 01:09:21,674
Who knew Groucho's secret word?

789
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:25,634
Groucho's secret word...
I give up.

790
01:09:26,680 --> 01:09:30,798
The Duck? - The Duck knew.
Say the word and divide 100 dollars.

791
01:09:31,240 --> 01:09:36,598
When Wittgenstein's house was built,
language philosophy hit the Bauhaus.

792
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:39,031
I saw the house not long ago.

793
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:44,195
Who played "The Beav?"
- Jerry Mathers. - Yes!

794
01:09:44,760 --> 01:09:50,153
"Oh wind, if winter comes, can spring
be far behind?" - Beautiful.

795
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:56,036
Who was Howdy Doody's closest friend?
- Buffalo Bob.

796
01:10:21,880 --> 01:10:26,237
Fantastic! Do they have a pool?
- Yes! Do you have a pool?

797
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:30,436
I love this place!

798
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:18,438
This breeze is great!

799
01:11:19,960 --> 01:11:23,350
It feels great!
- I love hotel sheets, and they feel

800
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:26,550
so good against your bare skin.

801
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:28,353
I'll put your bag in here.

802
01:11:29,200 --> 01:11:30,428
Come here first.

803
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:42,553
Come here again.

804
01:11:54,920 --> 01:11:59,118
Sandy, your breasts feel weird.
- Oh, that's cause they're real.

805
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:06,273
Let me get this shoe off. My God!

806
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:10,039
I should warn you,

807
01:12:11,080 --> 01:12:15,232
I'm old and if I take a while...
My God, I'm young again!

808
01:12:17,160 --> 01:12:21,199
It's been great to see you again.
- It's nice seeing you, too.

809
01:12:21,640 --> 01:12:22,834
How are you?

810
01:12:24,680 --> 01:12:26,716
Well, I'm confused.

811
01:12:29,560 --> 01:12:32,438
Hey, listen to this.
- What? - Listen.

812
01:12:42,720 --> 01:12:47,589
What on earth are they doing?
- Oh God, they're going crazy.

813
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:30,433
Jack told me he wants
to make our relationship exclusive.

814
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:32,791
He's not gonna go out anymore?

815
01:13:33,240 --> 01:13:36,630
I don't think
he could ever get a date.

816
01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:39,640
Seeing me go out drove him nuts.

817
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:41,149
What now?

818
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:46,833
I don't know. I really like him,
even though he's not so smart.

819
01:13:53,960 --> 01:13:55,439
Listen.
- What?

820
01:13:56,880 --> 01:14:01,112
Through the wall.
- What is it? - Somebody's doing it.

821
01:14:01,560 --> 01:14:06,634
How beautiful. - They're really
excited. They must be cheating.

822
01:14:28,200 --> 01:14:31,875
I don't believe it!
Are you staying here? - Yes.

823
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:37,155
There goes our cover. There are no
secrets anymore. - I think there is.

824
01:14:41,480 --> 01:14:45,359
Roland, this is Sandy.
Sandy, this is Roland, this is Sara.

825
01:14:46,760 --> 01:14:48,273
Where are you headed?

826
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:50,438
The restaurant.
- Us, too.

827
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:54,190
Why don't you join us?
- That would be neat. - No,

828
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:58,838
you guys should be alone. - Don't be
silly. We can't do that. Come on.

829
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:14,037
What's that clanging sound?
- It's my damn testicles.

830
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:27,030
Is it okay to spin here?
- Sure.

831
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:32,953
Shall I get your sweater?
I'm cold. - Yes, thanks.

832
01:15:33,400 --> 01:15:34,833
I'll run and get it.

833
01:15:35,800 --> 01:15:38,314
Harris, want to come with me?
- Sure.

834
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:41,631
Actually, I'll stay here.

835
01:15:42,920 --> 01:15:44,751
Back in a flash!

836
01:15:46,360 --> 01:15:49,193
You liar!
- I come here thinking

837
01:15:49,640 --> 01:15:53,633
you're with your ex, and you're
really giving it to my best friend!

838
01:15:54,080 --> 01:15:58,278
Your best friend? You've
never even seen him without me!

839
01:15:58,720 --> 01:16:00,551
There's a bond among men!

840
01:16:02,280 --> 01:16:05,078
Anyway, there's two liars here.
- Roland is my ex!

841
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:10,038
Okay, one.
- Hey, watch!

842
01:16:13,120 --> 01:16:15,554
Great!
- Thank you!

843
01:16:17,080 --> 01:16:19,310
You just broke up with someone?

844
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:24,117
How do you know that? - When men just
break up with someone, they always

845
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:28,314
run around with someone much younger.
- She'll be 27 in 4 years.

846
01:16:30,160 --> 01:16:32,879
I'm with her but only think about you.

847
01:16:33,320 --> 01:16:35,197
Is that why you fucked her today?

848
01:16:35,640 --> 01:16:36,629
Yes!

849
01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:39,396
I know that doesn't make sense.

850
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:42,434
But you almost broke through our wall!

851
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:46,395
You know how that made me feel?
- You didn't even know it was me!

852
01:16:47,160 --> 01:16:50,038
Yeah...
but I projected back when I found out.

853
01:16:51,320 --> 01:16:52,435
Coming!

854
01:16:55,080 --> 01:16:58,038
So close, we're this close to it!

855
01:16:58,640 --> 01:17:00,119
Stay here in L.A.

856
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:03,556
What? How would it work?

857
01:17:04,120 --> 01:17:08,159
We'd see each other,
take it easy at first and then...

858
01:17:09,160 --> 01:17:11,037
marriage, kids, old age, and death.

859
01:17:12,160 --> 01:17:13,718
What if I were to go?

860
01:17:15,520 --> 01:17:20,389
All I know is, on the day your plane
was to leave, if I had the power,

861
01:17:20,840 --> 01:17:22,432
I would turn the winds around,

862
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:26,032
roll in the fog,
I would bring in storms,

863
01:17:26,840 --> 01:17:31,038
I would change the polarity of
the earth so compasses couldn't work,

864
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:33,675
so your plane couldn't take off.

865
01:17:41,880 --> 01:17:44,235
This is everything I didn't want.

866
01:17:44,680 --> 01:17:48,559
Pain... lying... complications.

867
01:17:51,160 --> 01:17:52,957
I'm hot from running now.

868
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:56,513
Let's all walk down to the pier.
- Cool.

869
01:17:57,120 --> 01:18:01,113
Do you ever wonder why the water
doesn't fly up into the sky?

870
01:18:06,360 --> 01:18:10,638
Do you want this in the trunk
or up front? - That... up front.

871
01:18:18,160 --> 01:18:21,436
What's the matter? You ok?
- Oh, sorry... I'm okay.

872
01:18:22,600 --> 01:18:26,912
I've been working on Sara to come
back with me. I'm her ex-husband.

873
01:18:27,560 --> 01:18:29,710
England and America are different.

874
01:18:30,160 --> 01:18:32,993
The English keep civil relations
with their ex's.

875
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:35,396
The Americans sue them.

876
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:41,830
She told me today it's not right.

877
01:18:42,920 --> 01:18:46,230
Really? - Evidently,
she's been seeing some American.

878
01:18:46,680 --> 01:18:49,797
That can happen.
- She's not going with him either.

879
01:18:50,240 --> 01:18:53,630
She's going back to London
as soon as she can.

880
01:18:54,360 --> 01:18:55,634
Pity,

881
01:18:56,880 --> 01:18:58,632
I so wanted this to work out.

882
01:18:59,080 --> 01:19:01,435
I wanted a relationship, you know,

883
01:19:02,760 --> 01:19:04,432
like you and Sandy have.

884
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:14,832
I've been thinking.
I can be a man worth staying for.

885
01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:19,239
First, I can cry. Usually,
it's when I'm hurt, but it's a start.

886
01:19:19,680 --> 01:19:23,036
I know there's something
that would make you stay!

887
01:19:23,480 --> 01:19:25,789
The right word, attitude, plan...

888
01:19:26,240 --> 01:19:28,993
but these are all tricks!
So let's forego that!

889
01:19:29,440 --> 01:19:32,955
Let's assume that it happened,
that my hand went down

890
01:19:33,400 --> 01:19:35,789
your throat,
grabbed your heart and squoze it!

891
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:39,715
There comes a time
when it's now or never!

892
01:19:40,160 --> 01:19:42,799
It's now or never! Listen to a poem.

893
01:19:43,240 --> 01:19:46,516
"Oh pointy birds, oh pointy,
pointy, anoint..."

894
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:53,709
And now, here's
Morris Frost with a cinema review.

895
01:19:55,480 --> 01:19:57,596
The film, "Sliced Up Mommy,"

896
01:19:58,040 --> 01:20:01,635
is an effort to intertwine
the psychological nature of...

897
01:20:02,920 --> 01:20:05,036
I'd like to turn this car in.

898
01:20:05,480 --> 01:20:08,233
And now, the weather report.

899
01:20:09,160 --> 01:20:10,115
Sunny...

900
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:11,994
72...

901
01:20:12,720 --> 01:20:13,835
That's the weather.

902
01:20:16,160 --> 01:20:20,153
Our next weather report
will be in 4 days. - Thank you.

903
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:24,634
We'll be right back
after this commercial ad.

904
01:20:30,440 --> 01:20:34,228
Why is it that we don't always
recognize when love begins,

905
01:20:35,120 --> 01:20:38,237
but we always know when it ends?

906
01:20:49,720 --> 01:20:51,551
Final destination is London?

907
01:23:43,040 --> 01:23:44,598
That's twice.

908
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:16,435
Forget for this moment,
the smog and the cars and the skating

909
01:24:17,040 --> 01:24:18,473
and remember only this:

910
01:24:19,520 --> 01:24:24,833
A kiss may not be the truth,
but it is what we wish were true.

911
01:24:30,040 --> 01:24:34,830
Wow! That was really something!
- It was fantastic,

912
01:24:35,280 --> 01:24:37,919
it was...
- It had real class!

913
01:24:38,360 --> 01:24:42,239
Is there anything we can do
to thank you? A gift or anything?

914
01:24:42,680 --> 01:24:44,432
- Name it.

915
01:24:45,320 --> 01:24:48,710
- Done.

916
01:24:49,160 --> 01:24:51,116
I never figured out the riddle.

917
01:24:57,440 --> 01:24:59,829
"How Daddy is doing."

918
01:25:00,280 --> 01:25:03,113
It's a riddle too tough for me.
- I know it.

919
01:25:04,520 --> 01:25:06,238
It's an English crossword clue.

920
01:25:06,680 --> 01:25:09,240
See, unscramble means rearrange.

921
01:25:12,560 --> 01:25:14,630
Change the "s" with the "h,"

922
01:25:15,800 --> 01:25:18,872
move the "ing" after the "s,"

923
01:25:19,480 --> 01:25:20,629
put the "do" after them.

924
01:25:22,080 --> 01:25:23,911
Swap the "h" and the "s."

925
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:27,394
And put the "i" behind the "d."

926
01:25:31,560 --> 01:25:35,030
"Sing Doo Wah Diddy?"
That's the mystery of the ages?

927
01:25:38,080 --> 01:25:39,035
I sat up nights

928
01:25:39,480 --> 01:25:42,950
working on that. But I forgive you.

929
01:25:45,760 --> 01:25:47,637
There's one thing I need to know.

930
01:25:49,280 --> 01:25:54,195
Did you do this?
Did I do this? How did this happen?

931
01:25:59,400 --> 01:26:01,072
Hey, you got your voice back!

01:26:35,080 --> 01:26:38,436
There are only two things
in my life I will never forget.

933
01:26:39,440 --> 01:26:42,432
One is that
there is someone for everyone.

934
01:26:43,240 --> 01:26:47,153
Even if you need a pickax, a compass,
and night goggles to find them.

935
01:26:47,600 --> 01:26:49,556
And the other... is tonight.

936
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:54,437
When I learned that romance
does exist deep in the heart of L.A.
