1
00:04:07,847 --> 00:04:08,996
Happy Birthday, Princess!

2
00:04:12,527 --> 00:04:13,642
Is this for me?

3
00:04:14,247 --> 00:04:15,521
Certainly, Princess.

4
00:04:17,967 --> 00:04:19,525
It's for you.
Here.

5
00:04:20,967 --> 00:04:22,639
Congratulations... and Happy Birthday.

6
00:04:23,887 --> 00:04:24,922
Thank you.

7
00:04:25,127 --> 00:04:26,321
Where did you get it?

8
00:04:26,607 --> 00:04:28,086
What a nice bicycle!

9
00:04:29,207 --> 00:04:30,481
Yes it's fantastic,

10
00:04:31,007 --> 00:04:33,646
And it has a basket, side pockets,
and it's 18 speed.

11
00:04:34,527 --> 00:04:36,483
These friends of yours,
who are they?

12
00:04:37,607 --> 00:04:39,359
They help me with stuff, mom.

13
00:04:39,607 --> 00:04:40,756
Yeah? What stuff?

14
00:04:42,527 --> 00:04:43,960
Answer me, what kind of stuff?

15
00:04:47,327 --> 00:04:48,442
Why!

16
00:04:49,927 --> 00:04:53,044
We take tourist on tours around the city,
I do it in english.

17
00:04:54,007 --> 00:04:55,007
What else?

18
00:04:55,247 --> 00:04:56,600
I got many brains!

19
00:04:58,247 --> 00:04:59,566
Later, Princess.

20
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:02,357
All right, come with me,
and I'll show you around.

21
00:05:03,447 --> 00:05:06,166
No, it's too dangerous,
with all these foreigners.

22
00:05:06,447 --> 00:05:07,926
Why do you act like this?

23
00:05:08,647 --> 00:05:10,603
Mom, I bought it, it's paid for.

24
00:05:11,127 --> 00:05:14,403
Why can't you behave,
like your sister for an example..

25
00:05:14,607 --> 00:05:19,679
You wouldn't talk to me like this,
if your father was here.

26
00:05:20,007 --> 00:05:21,326
Well he's not here!

27
00:05:28,487 --> 00:05:29,522
Be back later, mom.

28
00:05:30,487 --> 00:05:33,126
Will you be back later today to spend the night?

29
00:05:33,527 --> 00:05:35,916
You will be back later, no?

30
00:05:38,047 --> 00:05:40,242
You can't use this bike, I forbid it.

31
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:43,840
Why not?
The Lord created bicycles for this purpose.

32
00:05:44,087 --> 00:05:47,238
The Lord did not create bicycles,
and I wont let you ride it!

33
00:05:52,367 --> 00:05:54,358
Time is money, my friends!
I got to run!

34
00:06:06,767 --> 00:06:09,122
My name is Veronica.
How are you?

35
00:06:10,407 --> 00:06:11,476
And?

36
00:06:13,447 --> 00:06:15,199
I am happy to be here.

37
00:06:15,527 --> 00:06:17,995
That's real good, you're getting better.

38
00:06:26,807 --> 00:06:28,007
Welcome to Mexico city.

39
00:06:28,008 --> 00:06:29,042
Thanks you.

40
00:06:29,207 --> 00:06:30,242
Attention please!

41
00:06:30,487 --> 00:06:34,526
Passenger Ramona Lopez, please go
to the nearest pager phone...

42
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:36,406
Is this it?

43
00:06:36,727 --> 00:06:39,001
Ok. Girls let's go.
This way

44
00:06:43,367 --> 00:06:47,443
Girls, this is Vadim Yochenko
head of the Agency

45
00:06:47,527 --> 00:06:49,597
And this is...
- Manuel

46
00:06:49,927 --> 00:06:51,918
Manuel.
He will be escorting you to Los Angeles.

47
00:06:52,127 --> 00:06:54,401
Welcome to Mexico.

48
00:06:55,527 --> 00:06:58,040
What a pretty smile.

49
00:07:00,167 --> 00:07:03,556
Let's go, we'll talk in the car.

50
00:07:06,087 --> 00:07:08,806
Oh I forgot... can I get your passports please.

51
00:07:11,167 --> 00:07:14,318
It's ok.
Thanks you.

52
00:07:16,007 --> 00:07:18,360
Excuse me, but there's something wrong?

53
00:07:18,487 --> 00:07:20,522
What's wrong?

54
00:07:20,767 --> 00:07:24,802
The passports.

55
00:07:25,087 --> 00:07:28,682
Forgive me, but why have you taken our passports?

56
00:07:29,327 --> 00:07:30,521
Visas.

57
00:07:32,087 --> 00:07:33,884
But we already have visas.

58
00:07:38,007 --> 00:07:42,762
Shut up, don't forget we know where your parents live,
and we also know about your little son.

59
00:08:20,487 --> 00:08:24,320
Hey! What's up my friend?
You're alone?

60
00:08:24,427 --> 00:08:27,702
I can show you around,
museum of fertility?

61
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:29,340
No thank's... I'm cool

62
00:08:29,387 --> 00:08:30,087
What?

63
00:08:30,127 --> 00:08:32,240
Mui... cool... suave?

64
00:08:32,247 --> 00:08:35,939
Hey! But you got to take a look Mr. Cool.
Look, just look.

65
00:08:36,327 --> 00:08:39,080
Please, look... look... just a second.

66
00:08:39,327 --> 00:08:42,521
Here... please

67
00:08:43,607 --> 00:08:46,357
You want a true Mexican experience?

68
00:08:47,327 --> 00:08:50,521
We got treasures that look better
than these fucking pyramids.

69
00:08:52,047 --> 00:08:54,800
Your dollars will go a long long way down here.

70
00:08:55,727 --> 00:08:58,321
The one on the left there
- Rosita, La Ra Rosita.

71
00:08:59,007 --> 00:09:03,363
She's first class,
she gives real good head.

72
00:09:11,247 --> 00:09:15,559
Come on!
We're close.

73
00:09:27,527 --> 00:09:30,758
Forgive me my friend, you wont get
to taste today any Mexican pussy.

74
00:09:31,287 --> 00:09:32,402
Don't kill me.

75
00:09:32,607 --> 00:09:36,680
Yes sir you'll be giving us everything, ok.

76
00:09:36,887 --> 00:09:39,957
You know what, if I was you?
I bet you hate all Mexicans right now.

77
00:09:40,847 --> 00:09:45,443
Guys, what do we do to Gringos?
Who disrespect the Mexicans?

78
00:09:48,487 --> 00:09:49,715
Show him!

79
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:54,480
Die bitch.

80
00:10:42,367 --> 00:10:44,403
Down with Americans, America sucks!

81
00:10:48,727 --> 00:10:51,002
To my brother with love, from Adriana.

82
00:12:19,927 --> 00:12:22,600
No! No! No!

83
00:12:41,687 --> 00:12:43,120
Look's like they're enjoying themselves.

84
00:12:44,007 --> 00:12:45,360
You're not kidding!

85
00:12:48,127 --> 00:12:50,402
Hey!
This bicycle looks familiar.

86
00:12:52,127 --> 00:12:55,516
Hey! Hey...
stop!

87
00:13:00,047 --> 00:13:01,799
What's the matter?
What's going on?

88
00:13:04,327 --> 00:13:05,396
What's the matter?

89
00:13:09,287 --> 00:13:12,482
Hey you, son of a bitch,
you stole my sister bicycle.

90
00:13:12,487 --> 00:13:13,881
No! I found it in the street!

91
00:13:13,887 --> 00:13:15,202
Tell that to your mother!

92
00:13:15,447 --> 00:13:16,596
Really!
Really!

93
00:13:16,807 --> 00:13:17,842
I found it,
believe me!

94
00:13:18,167 --> 00:13:19,395
Alright!
Alright!

95
00:13:19,767 --> 00:13:21,995
I'll show you where I found it!

96
00:13:22,167 --> 00:13:24,395
Let's go!
Hurry up move! Faster!

97
00:13:30,167 --> 00:13:31,486
Show me where you found it?

98
00:13:31,767 --> 00:13:33,882
Right there.

99
00:13:48,867 --> 00:13:50,882
Hey!

100
00:14:17,167 --> 00:14:18,236
Hey!
Where you going?

101
00:14:18,487 --> 00:14:20,159
Jorge, what are you doing?
That was my sisters!

102
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:23,720
Why?, why?

103
00:14:26,167 --> 00:14:28,078
Did you see the girl on the bicycle?

104
00:14:28,567 --> 00:14:31,320
My son is a sleep, and I can't...
God help you.

105
00:14:32,367 --> 00:14:36,121
Nobody saw a damn thing,
it's time to go and see Don Victor.

106
00:14:39,007 --> 00:14:40,326
Let's go!

107
00:14:48,767 --> 00:14:51,076
If she was taken in this part of city,
it means the Russian took her.

108
00:14:51,487 --> 00:14:52,966
Russian?

109
00:14:53,207 --> 00:14:54,322
They're animals.

110
00:14:54,527 --> 00:14:56,438
They buy and sell anything
they get there hands on.

111
00:14:57,727 --> 00:14:59,797
A pretty girl, like your sister,
it's very possible,

112
00:15:00,047 --> 00:15:02,436
And for them a virgin...
is solid gold.

113
00:15:04,607 --> 00:15:08,066
She's only 13, Don Victor.
Please tell me, where I can find her!

114
00:15:08,087 --> 00:15:10,520
Help me please!
With the Russian?

115
00:15:10,527 --> 00:15:12,042
They're everywhere.

116
00:15:12,247 --> 00:15:14,044
Heard about globalization?
It's ridiculous.

117
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:18,276
How about in Mexico City, Don Victor.

118
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:21,758
What are you gonna do?
Go there and knock on his door?

119
00:15:22,567 --> 00:15:24,922
I am not afraid of them.
Besides, my friends will back me up.

120
00:15:30,727 --> 00:15:34,163
These two blockheads?
Look at them!

121
00:15:34,647 --> 00:15:36,797
You don't have any idea about the Russian!
You guys wont be a treat to them

122
00:15:37,487 --> 00:15:38,681
They will go with me!

123
00:15:45,007 --> 00:15:47,999
Why the long faces?
Are we not in fact brothers?

124
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:50,761
She is my sister, God Damn!
You chickenshits!

125
00:15:50,927 --> 00:15:55,876
It's my sister, for Christ sake!
Kiss my ass, jerkoffs!

126
00:15:57,007 --> 00:15:58,520
Calm down!
Calm down!

127
00:16:00,247 --> 00:16:03,159
Calm down right now!
Stay calm!

128
00:16:04,087 --> 00:16:05,645
Take it easy...
easy.

129
00:16:09,687 --> 00:16:12,838
If they really taken her,
she's probably in route by now.

130
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:15,041
In route where?

131
00:16:16,927 --> 00:16:19,487
After they kidnap the girls,
they get'm across the border

132
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:27,521
As soon as possible and there they sell them,
they do the same thing over and over again.

133
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:32,196
If it is who I think it is,
they always use the same routine.

134
00:16:32,807 --> 00:16:34,923
They stay usually in a
place close by the airport.

135
00:16:35,847 --> 00:16:41,202
And they get more money if
they sell them to... pedophiles.

136
00:16:56,927 --> 00:16:57,962
Thanks you

137
00:16:58,927 --> 00:17:00,962
In there

138
00:17:09,327 --> 00:17:10,999
Don't touch me, please.

139
00:17:11,487 --> 00:17:18,837
Come on, lay down and enjoy yourself.
We know, where your son is.

140
00:17:53,567 --> 00:17:55,523
Mexico - The cheapest way there?

141
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:02,437
This here is the best choice.

142
00:18:06,007 --> 00:18:09,124
I need to make some money,
so I can take my son to America.

143
00:18:19,327 --> 00:18:20,919
Mom is back!

144
00:18:24,167 --> 00:18:29,605
You'll be very happy with this travel package,
I agree it's the best way,

145
00:18:31,567 --> 00:18:34,206
The names and the address of my parents,
is that really necessary?

146
00:18:34,487 --> 00:18:36,796
Usual bureaucratic procedure.

147
00:18:48,087 --> 00:18:49,087
It's here.

148
00:18:54,367 --> 00:18:58,076
Why! Is it necessary for us to be here?

149
00:18:59,767 --> 00:19:01,246
No it's not necessary.

150
00:19:50,447 --> 00:19:51,641
Take this.

151
00:20:21,807 --> 00:20:27,245
Vitamins... It'll help for the pain.

152
00:20:32,807 --> 00:20:36,277
Take it,
understand!

153
00:21:34,367 --> 00:21:36,244
Do you speak spanish?

154
00:21:41,887 --> 00:21:43,286
English?

155
00:21:44,687 --> 00:21:46,166
A little.

156
00:21:46,527 --> 00:21:49,200
Me too... a little.

157
00:21:59,847 --> 00:22:01,724
I wish all this would end.

158
00:22:04,007 --> 00:22:09,081
I want to go home, I miss my mother.

159
00:22:22,167 --> 00:22:23,919
You believe in it?

160
00:22:28,647 --> 00:22:30,319
You pray to it?

161
00:22:32,607 --> 00:22:36,236
Yes.
Very strong.

162
00:22:37,367 --> 00:22:41,918
She's great,
she'll make my brother to find me.

163
00:22:43,367 --> 00:22:44,800
You have a brother?

164
00:22:46,127 --> 00:22:47,640
That's good.

165
00:22:58,847 --> 00:23:00,439
Hey! Hello!

166
00:23:01,527 --> 00:23:03,995
Did you see a girl,
about this tall, with long hair?

167
00:23:04,527 --> 00:23:06,916
Dark hair, brown eyes, very pretty?

168
00:23:07,287 --> 00:23:08,800
No.
- Thanks.

169
00:23:14,247 --> 00:23:17,500
This tall, long dark hair,
with a ribbon?

170
00:23:18,067 --> 00:23:19,002
No.

171
00:23:19,167 --> 00:23:20,295
Did you see her?

172
00:23:21,087 --> 00:23:21,822
No.

173
00:23:22,087 --> 00:23:24,218
Dark hair, dark eyes, like yours.

174
00:23:24,227 --> 00:23:26,924
We got to go, hurry up, hurry...

175
00:23:27,527 --> 00:23:29,165
Did you see a little girl?

176
00:23:29,807 --> 00:23:31,365
Did you see a little girl, that tall?

177
00:23:31,687 --> 00:23:33,961
No, no, no, I didn't see her.

178
00:23:33,967 --> 00:23:35,266
With a ribbon.

179
00:23:35,467 --> 00:23:38,242
Watch where you're going,
why don't you look?

180
00:23:38,447 --> 00:23:39,846
Keep a look out and watch them

181
00:23:40,447 --> 00:23:43,165
Let's get going, get a move on.

182
00:23:47,927 --> 00:23:50,239
Come on sweety.

183
00:23:53,487 --> 00:23:57,825
Here we go, get in there,

184
00:24:20,887 --> 00:24:21,956
This guy has some fucking nerve!

185
00:24:24,807 --> 00:24:26,235
Shit!

186
00:24:26,247 --> 00:24:27,441

187
00:24:28,247 --> 00:24:31,521
Where the hell's he going, that bastard?

188
00:24:31,807 --> 00:24:33,081

193
00:25:50,727 --> 00:25:52,718
What flowers have you brought us today?

194
00:26:03,367 --> 00:26:05,835
How you all doing?

195
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:12,404
Which one do you like?

00:26:12,967 --> 00:26:15,276
The nice blonde.

197
00:26:15,527 --> 00:26:16,926
She's very young.

198
00:26:20,687 --> 00:26:23,326
You, you and you, get out.

Let's go! Hurry up! Let's move it!

200
00:26:26,807 --> 00:26:30,959
Very well, they wont be any trouble.

00:26:35,127 --> 00:26:38,403
Over here! Let's go!

202
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:44,519
Good morning, senorita.

Right here, let's go, hurry up!

205
00:27:18,247 --> 00:27:20,124
The documents have to be

206
00:27:21,087 --> 00:27:24,966
Forgive me, my friend,
but nothing get's done here without money.

207
00:27:36,007 --> 00:27:39,556
Here are a lot of scoundrels.
Really, how about the officer?

208
00:27:43,607 --> 00:27:44,801
Probably.

209
00:27:50,487 --> 00:27:55,607
Come here, stand right there.

210
00:28:01,127 --> 00:28:06,121
Pose.
Pose, like a cover girl for a magazine.

00:28:11,927 --> 00:28:13,440
Pose, and smile damn it!
Do it right,

00:29:19,527 --> 00:29:20,527

It's good, yes?
You must to eat.

217
00:30:46,647 --> 00:30:47,875
Hey, mommy.

218
00:30:48,127 --> 00:30:51,961
I don't know when, but one day you'll suffer
from the same cruelty, you've been giving us.

219
00:31:05,607 --> 00:31:11,523
Fucking communists.
Sure it was hard, yes?

220
00:31:13,127 --> 00:31:14,799
Devil's communists.

221
00:31:27,527 --> 00:31:28,846
Can I use your phone please?

222
00:31:29,727 --> 00:31:31,080
Sure, you can make a call.

223
00:31:48,487 --> 00:31:51,206
Hello?
Who is it?

224
00:31:54,167 --> 00:31:55,725
Hello? Why?

225
00:31:58,047 --> 00:31:59,605
Why?

226
00:34:05,367 --> 00:34:06,367
Hello?

227
00:36:08,487 --> 00:36:09,681
Everybody down!
Stay down! Stay down!

228
00:36:18,087 --> 00:36:19,236
We're on the border.

229
00:36:29,527 --> 00:36:30,721
Be careful.

230
00:36:31,167 --> 00:36:32,361
Good luck, let's go.

231
00:36:40,487 --> 00:36:41,522
What?

232
00:37:34,887 --> 00:37:36,843
Well, we made it across

233
00:37:45,887 --> 00:37:47,843
Shut your mouth or your
family will end up dead.

234
00:37:49,607 --> 00:37:51,916
Police!
Hands up! Don't move!

235
00:38:10,567 --> 00:38:12,762
Ray, is it you?

236
00:38:12,967 --> 00:38:13,967
Hi, honey.

237
00:38:14,167 --> 00:38:16,317
What's going on?
Where are you?

238
00:38:16,607 --> 00:38:19,041
I'm in Juarez.
I'll be home tomorrow.

239
00:38:19,687 --> 00:38:20,915
How is Ramona doing?

240
00:38:21,087 --> 00:38:24,363
Not so good,
I had to take her to the Vet again.

241
00:38:26,127 --> 00:38:27,958
What you're doing in Juarez?

242
00:38:29,967 --> 00:38:33,642
Nothing really, get some sleep.
I'll see you tomorrow.

243
00:39:05,367 --> 00:39:07,642
Delivering a speech from the oval office, the President
emphasized the importance of security at the border

244
00:39:07,967 --> 00:39:11,403
Now it's a 1.9 billion dollar
campaign to tighten border security.

245
00:39:12,687 --> 00:39:17,158
He hopes to win the backing from conservatives
to overhaul the immigration laws.

246
00:39:17,767 --> 00:39:20,759
And plans to order thousands
of troups to the Mexican border.

247
00:39:20,967 --> 00:39:22,002
Welcome back, sir.

248
00:39:22,567 --> 00:39:23,602
Thank you

249
00:39:28,887 --> 00:39:29,922
Open the gate.

250
00:39:30,767 --> 00:39:31,995
As you can see.

251
00:39:59,047 --> 00:40:00,241
Bring in the next - The following.

252
00:40:00,447 --> 00:40:01,766
You, you and you!

253
00:40:12,927 --> 00:40:13,962
Sir! Sir!

254
00:40:15,287 --> 00:40:16,356
What you want?

255
00:40:16,567 --> 00:40:18,319
We've been kidnapped!
We're kidnapped.

256
00:40:18,567 --> 00:40:20,285
Yeah yeah right.
Sit back down.

257
00:40:20,927 --> 00:40:24,476
Children, you're welcome to walk around,
you'll meet your teacher back here in 30 minutes.

258
00:40:26,087 --> 00:40:27,202
So, we shall begin.

259
00:40:27,567 --> 00:40:29,762
Everybody fallow me.
What will happen to them?

260
00:40:30,087 --> 00:40:33,124
They'll send them back to Mexico,
and release them.

261
00:40:33,407 --> 00:40:35,682
Most of them will cross
the border again tomorrow.

262
00:40:37,427 --> 00:40:42,715
Hello, I'm a student from
El Paso High

263
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:47,806
I study spanish and my teacher is Mr. Perez,

264
00:40:48,847 --> 00:40:52,362
And for four hours we do public service.

I'm also part Spanish.

266
00:40:55,447 --> 00:40:59,725
Here, I hope you like it.

267
00:41:11,007 --> 00:41:14,841
Vehicle 174, you should
make the border by 5:30.

268
00:41:15,327 --> 00:41:17,966
Copy that, be there in three minutes.

269
00:42:03,167 --> 00:42:06,806
Hey! Hey! Hold...

270
00:42:07,167 --> 00:42:09,806
What are you doing in my trunk?

271
00:42:11,647 --> 00:42:13,444
How did you get in?
When did you get in?

272
00:42:13,587 --> 00:42:14,836
In Juarez!

273
00:42:15,407 --> 00:42:16,476
Juarez?

274
00:42:16,647 --> 00:42:18,205
I had to get across the border, man!

275
00:42:21,367 --> 00:42:22,800
You took the wrong ride, dude.

276
00:42:24,447 --> 00:42:25,846
Hey!

277
00:42:26,847 --> 00:42:27,962
Get in the car!

278
00:42:28,167 --> 00:42:29,167
In the car!

279
00:42:30,767 --> 00:42:31,882
Sit down!

280
00:42:33,967 --> 00:42:36,356
Open it!

281
00:42:37,967 --> 00:42:38,356
Hey... hey...

282
00:42:39,847 --> 00:42:40,962
Do not move.

283
00:42:45,767 --> 00:42:46,802
Where are we going?

284
00:42:47,007 --> 00:42:48,007
Going to the Police.

285
00:42:48,247 --> 00:42:49,396
Fuck!

286
00:42:49,607 --> 00:42:53,077
You broke the law, son.
And you got real unlucky, because I'm a cop.

287
00:42:53,527 --> 00:42:54,880
Fuck that!

288
00:42:55,167 --> 00:42:58,407
Watch your language in my car.
Fasten your seat belt.

289
00:42:58,408 --> 00:42:59,442
What?

290
00:42:59,607 --> 00:43:01,279
Your belt!
Put it on!

291
00:43:02,087 --> 00:43:03,156
All right!

292
00:43:06,207 --> 00:43:07,481
Watch your language.

293
00:43:07,807 --> 00:43:09,126
I did!

294
00:43:24,247 --> 00:43:27,523
Look Mr... you can't take me to the police.

295
00:43:28,407 --> 00:43:29,920
Well I have to.

296
00:43:30,247 --> 00:43:32,477
They'll send me back,
I got to stay here!

297
00:43:32,727 --> 00:43:34,683
I'm looking for my little sister!
She was kidnapped!

298
00:43:34,685 --> 00:43:35,322
I'm not kidding, man!

299
00:43:36,527 --> 00:43:37,596
Sure.

300
00:43:37,927 --> 00:43:39,326
My little sister she's just 13!

301
00:43:40,607 --> 00:43:44,236
They took her in Mexico city, and I followed
them all the way up to that house in Juarez!

302
00:43:45,647 --> 00:43:46,966
What house?

303
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:50,237
You know the house,
you were there.

304
00:43:55,367 --> 00:43:57,517
Please, Mr... I need to get to New Jersey?

305
00:43:57,967 --> 00:43:59,195
Why New Jersey?

306
00:43:59,407 --> 00:44:02,046
To find her!
It's my fault she got taken!

307
00:44:02,567 --> 00:44:04,239
If your a cop?
Why can't you help me?

308
00:44:04,687 --> 00:44:08,440
I not that kind of cop.
And why should I believe you anyway.

309
00:44:11,247 --> 00:44:14,045
If your telling the truth,
the police will help you.

310
00:44:14,447 --> 00:44:15,960
Sure the will the fucking police!

311
00:44:16,807 --> 00:44:18,081
This isn't Mexico.

312
00:44:18,807 --> 00:44:21,002
Yeah right,
like the cops are so different here!

313
00:44:21,527 --> 00:44:25,236
They'll do nothing but send me back,
then my sister will be here all alone!

314
00:44:27,767 --> 00:44:31,043
Don't you understand?
They will do something terrible to her!

315
00:44:31,767 --> 00:44:33,598
She is pure!
She never...

316
00:44:33,807 --> 00:44:35,206
All right!

317
00:44:35,447 --> 00:44:36,800
So what you gonna do?

318
00:44:37,087 --> 00:44:39,396
Go to the police.
I hate liars.

319
00:44:41,487 --> 00:44:44,684
Forgive me, last time we had some problem.
This time I am more informed.

320
00:44:44,967 --> 00:44:48,322
Stay back, let me take a look.
- Fine

321
00:44:48,847 --> 00:44:49,246
Yes, yes okay!

322
00:45:05,427 --> 00:45:09,279
Quiet... get down!

00:45:12,608 --> 00:45:14,642
Please god help me!

324
00:45:19,607 --> 00:45:20,607
All right, they're gone.

325
00:45:21,847 --> 00:45:23,439
Let's go! Move it.

326
00:45:34,807 --> 00:45:35,956
Sacred Virgin, Sacred Maiden,
please hear my prayer...

327
00:45:36,487 --> 00:45:38,796
The Lord be with you,
and blessed are thee...

328
00:45:39,367 --> 00:45:41,039
Forgive me for what I have done...

329
00:45:41,487 --> 00:45:45,002
Sacred Mary, Sacred Virgin,
pray for us sinners...

330
00:45:56,247 --> 00:45:57,247
Can I help you ma'am?

331
00:45:57,487 --> 00:45:58,487
Somebody broke in.

332
00:45:59,607 --> 00:46:00,960
The back was door was locked.

333
00:46:01,367 --> 00:46:03,722
My husband is out of town,
and we moved in recently.

334
00:46:03,967 --> 00:46:06,401
Can somebody come out to the house...

335
00:46:06,687 --> 00:46:08,247
Sure ma'am.
We'll get an officer out there right the way.

336
00:46:08,248 --> 00:46:09,248
Your name ma'am?

337
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:13,559
Ms. Bjukenen, your address?

338
00:46:14,207 --> 00:46:16,801
6525 Glennbrook Lane.

339
00:46:18,247 --> 00:46:19,396
Do not move.

340
00:46:20,247 --> 00:46:21,919
We'll try to get somebody
out there right the way

341
00:46:22,167 --> 00:46:25,159
Sorry to interrupt.
I need to see your Commanding Officer.

342
00:46:25,447 --> 00:46:27,597
I got a boy here,
he says his sister been kidnapped.

343
00:46:27,687 --> 00:46:28,687
Which boy?

344
00:46:42,767 --> 00:46:45,520
Come here.
Where're you going?

345
00:46:45,927 --> 00:46:47,440
New Jersey, I told you.

346
00:46:47,727 --> 00:46:49,797
If you're going to I
you're going the wrong direction.

347
00:46:50,087 --> 00:46:51,156
It is that way.

348
00:46:53,727 --> 00:46:55,319
You just gonna take me back to the cops.

349
00:46:55,447 --> 00:46:56,447
No, I won't

350
00:46:58,167 --> 00:47:00,237
Listen, if your sister is in New Jersey,

351
00:47:00,487 --> 00:47:03,206
I know someone there,
who might be able to help us.

352
00:47:03,887 --> 00:47:05,002
Us!

353
00:47:05,367 --> 00:47:07,278
A guy I went to the academy
with he's a good man.

354
00:47:07,767 --> 00:47:09,359
Come on we should try to see him.

355
00:47:13,647 --> 00:47:15,080
Is it far away from here?

356
00:47:17,127 --> 00:47:20,836
It's a little out of the way,
but... I'll take you.

357
00:47:22,327 --> 00:47:23,760
Why should I trust you?

358
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:25,326
I don't think you a have choice.

359
00:47:33,447 --> 00:47:34,562
Come on.

360
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:44,485
Please change the music.

361
00:47:46,327 --> 00:47:49,683
You don't like that?
Put your seat belt on.

362
00:47:57,647 --> 00:47:59,160
What for, it's stupid.

363
00:48:12,967 --> 00:48:16,243
Middle of the damn day?
Don't do it again stupid.

364
00:48:16,607 --> 00:48:18,563
You think the cops taking a nap?

365
00:48:19,207 --> 00:48:20,401
Are you crazy?

366
00:48:23,087 --> 00:48:24,406
That ain't bad.

367
00:48:25,007 --> 00:48:32,357
We are here, aren't we?
And I'm not crazy.

368
00:48:36,207 --> 00:48:39,324
Hurry, hurry, let's go!
Pick up a knot! Move!

369
00:48:52,287 --> 00:48:56,838
You got a name?
I thought, even Mexicans have name's.

370
00:48:57,247 --> 00:48:58,726
Fuck!
What's your problem?

371
00:49:06,007 --> 00:49:07,725
Jorge, please to meet you Jorge.
I'm Ray.

372
00:49:09,887 --> 00:49:12,526
How come you speak english so well?

373
00:49:13,807 --> 00:49:15,638
I work in tourist industry.

374
00:49:17,207 --> 00:49:18,401
Put your foot down!

375
00:49:18,647 --> 00:49:20,877
My god!
What's the big deal!

376
00:49:21,647 --> 00:49:22,841
The car can be cleaned!

377
00:49:23,047 --> 00:49:24,639
Exactly.

378
00:49:34,327 --> 00:49:35,840
That's yours now.

379
00:49:40,247 --> 00:49:42,238
So... how come you there
in that house in Juarez?

380
00:49:42,727 --> 00:49:44,206
Private investigation.

381
00:49:46,127 --> 00:49:48,038
What kind of investigation Ray,

382
00:49:49,047 --> 00:49:51,959
It's private.
That means I don't want to talk about it.

383
00:49:52,007 --> 00:49:53,007
Why not?

384
00:49:53,207 --> 00:49:54,356
Because I don't!

385
00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:58,043
Oh, Jesus!
Why you getting so pissed off?

386
00:50:02,967 --> 00:50:04,685
We got to find a rest stop.

387
00:50:07,127 --> 00:50:08,958
When's the last time you took a shower?

388
00:50:09,487 --> 00:50:10,522
What?

389
00:50:10,727 --> 00:50:12,922
If you haven't noticed it, you stink.

390
00:50:19,767 --> 00:50:22,564
Stop here, we'll make some real
good pocket change off of this

391
00:50:27,647 --> 00:50:29,080
They're not real busy yet.

392
00:50:29,527 --> 00:50:30,960
You stay with the rest of them.

393
00:50:42,407 --> 00:50:43,920
You, come here.

394
00:50:44,847 --> 00:50:46,447
No!
Take me!

395
00:50:46,448 --> 00:50:47,487
Let her go.

396
00:50:47,488 --> 00:50:48,488
Take me!

397
00:50:48,489 --> 00:50:49,622
Hey! Let her go!
Take me!

398
00:50:50,727 --> 00:50:54,322
She's really scared, don't take her,
let me go instead,

399
00:51:01,327 --> 00:51:02,840
Veronica!

400
00:51:11,567 --> 00:51:13,444
You will be called Princess,
that's your new name

401
00:51:28,607 --> 00:51:31,804
But no fucking this one.
I have to keep her a real virgin.

402
00:51:33,087 --> 00:51:34,156
How much?

403
00:51:34,407 --> 00:51:35,556
$80.00

404
00:52:20,207 --> 00:52:22,481
I'm a virgin.

405
00:53:42,707 --> 00:53:44,424
It's only 14 more kilometers.

406
00:54:30,442 --> 00:54:32,000
Patty is something wrong?

407
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:37,717
Why?
How's Ramona?

408
00:54:40,477 --> 00:54:43,274
The Vet had to put her to sleep.

409
00:54:46,274 --> 00:54:47,752
When?

410
00:54:48,353 --> 00:54:49,785
This afternoon.

411
00:54:51,751 --> 00:54:55,537
If you've taken your God-Damn cell phone
with you, I could have reached you.

412
00:54:58,188 --> 00:54:59,586
I'm so sorry Patty.

413
00:55:01,266 --> 00:55:05,257
It's good to hear that.
It's really good to hear that.

414
00:55:06,523 --> 00:55:09,422
Patty?
I can't talk anymore Ray.

415
00:55:12,820 --> 00:55:14,094
Good night.

416
00:55:14,659 --> 00:55:16,038
Let's eat.

417
00:55:16,039 --> 00:55:17,273
Who's Ramona?

418
00:55:17,278 --> 00:55:18,546
It's our cat.

419
00:55:19,097 --> 00:55:20,332
You have a cat?

420
00:55:21,176 --> 00:55:22,813
Yeah, people do have pets, you know.

421
00:55:23,415 --> 00:55:24,449
I hate cats.

422
00:55:24,774 --> 00:55:25,809
Okay.

423
00:55:26,054 --> 00:55:27,122
Any kids?

424
00:55:27,373 --> 00:55:28,600
Kids? No.

425
00:55:34,049 --> 00:55:35,562
So you guys live alone with a cat?

426
00:55:36,808 --> 00:55:37,922
Yeah.

427
00:55:38,083 --> 00:55:40,118
That's cool?

428
00:55:46,202 --> 00:55:49,751
New T-shirt, pretty cool huh?

429
00:55:55,239 --> 00:55:58,991
Listen, I only have pesos.
Are you going to pay?

430
00:55:59,356 --> 00:56:01,311
Do I have a choice?
You order what you want.

431
00:56:01,515 --> 00:56:02,789
Okay then.

432
00:56:03,594 --> 00:56:05,185
Are you guys all ready to order?

433
00:56:06,113 --> 00:56:10,309
Yes I'll have orange juice, coffee
an omelette with cheese and bacon.

434
00:56:10,711 --> 00:56:11,745
Thank you.

435
00:56:12,070 --> 00:56:17,141
I want a cup of coffee too, an orange juice, an
omelette with cheese, ham, mushrooms and onions.

436
00:56:17,187 --> 00:56:22,122
A fruit salad with yogurt, and a New York
ribeye steak medium rare with fries,

437
00:56:22,185 --> 00:56:26,937
Pancakes with blueberries and
a strawberry milk shake please.

438
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:33,218
What?

439
00:56:34,138 --> 00:56:36,093
You said I could order what ever I want.

440
00:56:36,497 --> 00:56:37,850
Right.

441
00:56:42,014 --> 00:56:44,285
I know that kid.

442
00:57:03,523 --> 00:57:06,399
Hey! Stay away from my van,
you God-Damn little punk!

443
00:57:10,079 --> 00:57:13,433
What's going on here?

444
00:57:14,197 --> 00:57:15,471
I'm looking for somebody!

445
00:57:15,676 --> 00:57:16,711
Let me see some I.D.

446
00:57:17,276 --> 00:57:18,947
I left them at home sir.

447
00:57:19,195 --> 00:57:20,263
Where do you live?

448
00:57:20,314 --> 00:57:20,849
I live...

449
00:57:20,893 --> 00:57:22,062
Allen, Texas.

450
00:57:22,073 --> 00:57:24,090
This is my son, Officer.
Where the hell have you been?

451
00:57:24,112 --> 00:57:25,080
Allen P.D.

452
00:57:25,151 --> 00:57:27,269
I'm looking all over for you.

453
00:57:27,270 --> 00:57:30,146
No problem.
Have a nice night.

454
00:57:30,149 --> 00:57:31,941
Thank you,
you too.

455
00:57:34,907 --> 00:57:35,975
What the hell is going on?

456
00:57:36,186 --> 00:57:37,221
I knew that kid!

457
00:57:37,266 --> 00:57:38,334
From where?

458
00:57:38,705 --> 00:57:40,820
He was with my sister!
I saw him!

459
00:57:41,024 --> 00:57:43,298
He's one of the kids that they took.

460
00:57:43,542 --> 00:57:45,930
Excuse me sir,
can I talk to you for a second?

461
00:57:46,220 --> 00:57:49,659
Hey, you! I wanna ask you a question,
is this boy your son?

462
00:57:49,660 --> 00:57:50,660
I'm sorry?

463
00:57:50,859 --> 00:57:52,177
I asked you if this boy is your son?

464
00:57:52,578 --> 00:57:53,692
There's a misunderstanding.

465
00:57:53,897 --> 00:57:55,454
Sure. Come on.

466
00:57:55,656 --> 00:57:57,646
I'm trying to find the boys parents!
I didn't do anything!

467
00:57:58,135 --> 00:57:59,806
Listen!
Where did you get the boy?

468
00:57:59,894 --> 00:58:00,974
I don't know what you're talking about.

469
00:58:00,975 --> 00:58:02,053
You son of a bitch!

470
00:58:03,212 --> 00:58:04,327
Where's my sister,
you son of a bitch!

471
00:58:04,532 --> 00:58:05,759
You fucking bastard!
I hope, you'll die!

472
00:58:06,971 --> 00:58:08,198
Calm down!
Calm down!

473
00:58:09,430 --> 00:58:16,280
I want you to take the boy
outside and give him to the police.

474
00:58:16,430 --> 00:58:17,280
Go with him outside...

475
00:58:18,604 --> 00:58:21,595
I hope you'll die, motherfucker!

476
00:58:26,121 --> 00:58:30,191
Okay we got two possibilities here?

477
00:58:30,878 --> 00:58:32,196
There's cops out there.

478
00:58:32,437 --> 00:58:36,223
If you like, we scan go out there
and let them handle this whole thing.

479
00:58:36,675 --> 00:58:38,744
And you know,
they love guys like you.

480
00:58:39,754 --> 00:58:42,346
Or we can handle this just between us?

481
00:58:43,791 --> 00:58:45,429
What do you want from me?

482
00:58:46,070 --> 00:58:47,469
All I want is information.

483
00:58:49,389 --> 00:58:51,344
You okay?
Can you understand what I'm saying?

484
00:58:52,427 --> 00:58:53,905
Can you tell what happened?

485
00:58:54,506 --> 00:58:55,779
I'll be back in a second.

486
00:58:56,385 --> 00:58:57,453
What we got?

487
00:58:57,664 --> 00:58:58,779
Possibly child molester.

488
00:58:58,984 --> 00:59:00,177
So?

489
00:59:01,502 --> 00:59:02,537
Nothing.

490
00:59:02,862 --> 00:59:04,010
Nothing?

491
00:59:05,020 --> 00:59:06,692
He doesn't know where
the other kids are.

492
00:59:08,179 --> 00:59:09,372
Hands on your head!

493
00:59:09,698 --> 00:59:11,130
Enough we gotta roll.

494
00:59:11,417 --> 00:59:12,645
Yes, yes.

495
00:59:52,636 --> 00:59:57,502
Okay don't cry.
Tell me.

496
00:59:59,033 --> 01:00:04,343
I want to go home.
My mom don't love me no more.

497
01:00:05,309 --> 01:00:08,856
Your mom always loves you.
Always.

498
01:00:14,425 --> 01:00:16,494
It's party time.

499
01:00:16,703 --> 01:00:19,262
Leave us alone,
we don't want.

500
01:00:23,900 --> 01:00:26,174
It's no question about
volunteering, bitch.

501
01:00:32,975 --> 01:00:36,522
You see?
Well, good gal.

502
01:00:38,572 --> 01:00:41,926
Swallow now, swallow,
like a good girl.

503
01:00:56,003 --> 01:00:57,674
Good gal.

504
01:01:08,637 --> 01:01:09,910
Cyber cafe.

505
01:01:32,065 --> 01:01:33,213
Enter password.

506
01:01:38,901 --> 01:01:40,174
Orchid.

507
01:01:47,177 --> 01:01:49,087
Enter password.

508
01:01:52,014 --> 01:01:53,810
Greenhouse.

509
01:02:10,365 --> 01:02:13,116
Just come to get you. I need your help.

510
01:02:13,643 --> 01:02:17,236
Sir... that's my sister.

511
01:02:20,919 --> 01:02:22,715
Her name is Adriana not Maria.

512
01:02:41,309 --> 01:02:43,696
Bidding starts at $500.00 coming soon

513
01:02:44,107 --> 01:02:45,460
Stay tuned!

514
01:02:47,026 --> 01:02:52,700
I'm gonna kill the motherfucker
who does this. I kill them.

515
01:02:56,901 --> 01:02:59,174
Yeah, yeah.
I tried the password, it checks out

516
01:03:01,538 --> 01:03:03,732
Bidding starts.
Probably, in a day.

517
01:03:04,297 --> 01:03:06,526
I leave it up to you.
Alright.

518
01:03:16,850 --> 01:03:20,761
So... what did your friend say?

519
01:03:21,168 --> 01:03:22,566
Good news,
he's on the case.

520
01:03:22,767 --> 01:03:25,075
I gave him all the information.
The password all that stuff.

521
01:03:26,365 --> 01:03:29,162
He's gonna pass it on to his
friend at the Internet Crime Unit.

522
01:03:29,604 --> 01:03:31,400
They'll take care of it.

523
01:03:32,282 --> 01:03:35,398
Password? That's what the
guy gave you in the bathroom.

524
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:38,832
Yeah,
he bought that kid on the Internet.

525
01:03:39,799 --> 01:03:43,028
He was the highest bidder,
he flew all the way from Thailand.

526
01:03:43,277 --> 01:03:45,709
He paid $25,000.00,
that's how it works.

527
01:03:47,754 --> 01:03:49,709
I am sorry I didn't tell you before.

528
01:03:50,953 --> 01:03:53,227
I just wanted to make sure.
I'm just trying to protect you.

529
01:03:53,471 --> 01:03:54,471
Thanks.

530
01:03:56,270 --> 01:03:57,748
Jorge this is good news.

531
01:03:58,509 --> 01:04:02,625
Jesus!
You don't trust anybody, do you?

532
01:04:04,426 --> 01:04:08,463
Not everyone is your enemies, you know.
Try a little optimism sometime.

533
01:04:09,063 --> 01:04:10,178
It wont kill you.

534
01:04:11,502 --> 01:04:13,378
And be like you,
and end up with a cat?

535
01:04:23,576 --> 01:04:26,169
Sorry, I didn't mean it like that.

536
01:04:30,972 --> 01:04:32,120
When is the auction?

537
01:04:32,371 --> 01:04:36,123
Soon, I like to be in New Jersey
when it happens, wouldn't you?

538
01:04:37,049 --> 01:04:38,083
Do you drive?

539
01:04:38,568 --> 01:04:40,239
You want me to drive?

540
01:04:40,487 --> 01:04:41,522
I'm tired.

541
01:04:41,766 --> 01:04:43,643
But if I drive,
we need to play another music.

542
01:04:43,925 --> 01:04:45,358
What is your problem with my music?

543
01:04:46,124 --> 01:04:48,557
It puts me to sleep,
you want us to get killed or something?

544
01:04:55,399 --> 01:04:56,798
You can't stay here.

545
01:04:56,999 --> 01:04:59,830
Two guys and three girls, that's to many!
It's gonna look suspicious!

546
01:05:02,475 --> 01:05:04,864
It's only two girls.

547
01:05:05,193 --> 01:05:08,831
Have you gone crazy?
Look, I know that, we leave tomorrow.

548
01:05:11,751 --> 01:05:12,785
What?

549
01:05:12,990 --> 01:05:14,184
Nothing.

550
01:05:22,785 --> 01:05:24,661
Hello? How you doing?

551
01:05:27,023 --> 01:05:31,572
Listen, we've been on the
road day and night, simply...

552
01:05:32,660 --> 01:05:36,412
Okay calm down, calm down.

553
01:05:38,377 --> 01:05:39,855
All right, I've got it. Yeah.

554
01:05:42,415 --> 01:05:49,045
Son of a bitch. They set up
the next auction for tomorrow.

555
01:05:49,452 --> 01:05:50,725
You've got to be kidding me.

556
01:05:50,971 --> 01:05:54,757
That's what they want, she's next.

557
01:05:55,728 --> 01:05:58,036
We have to be in New Jersey by tomorrow.

558
01:06:00,166 --> 01:06:02,201
That's unreal.

559
01:06:05,683 --> 01:06:06,718
Get up.

560
01:06:09,521 --> 01:06:11,112
Get up!

561
01:06:21,875 --> 01:06:23,148
Good morning.

562
01:07:10,770 --> 01:07:16,125
Good morning.
What kind of cop are you?

563
01:07:16,886 --> 01:07:18,921
I'm in the Fraud Department.

564
01:07:19,125 --> 01:07:20,194
What kind of fraud?

565
01:07:20,484 --> 01:07:21,803
Insurance, mainly.

566
01:07:22,763 --> 01:07:24,957
You work for insurance companies?

567
01:07:25,522 --> 01:07:26,590
Well, yes.

568
01:07:27,161 --> 01:07:29,628
I think, you work for the wrong side.

569
01:07:43,593 --> 01:07:45,105
You have Mexicans friends?

570
01:07:45,352 --> 01:07:48,023
I have Mexican friends.
A very good friend in fact.

571
01:07:48,270 --> 01:07:51,341
He works in the office
right next to mine.

572
01:07:51,788 --> 01:07:53,584
You only have one Mexican friend?

573
01:07:55,346 --> 01:07:56,859
A good friend.

574
01:07:58,385 --> 01:08:01,295
How can you live in Texas, and not
have hundreds of Mexican friends?

575
01:08:04,182 --> 01:08:07,172
Okay wise ass do you have
a hundred American friends?

576
01:08:07,620 --> 01:08:08,972
All my friends are Americans.

577
01:08:09,139 --> 01:08:10,174
Really?

578
01:08:10,459 --> 01:08:11,493
Yes.

579
01:08:11,698 --> 01:08:17,372
All Mexicans are Americans, and all my friends
are Mexicans, so, all my friends are Americans.

580
01:08:17,935 --> 01:08:21,050
It's Northern America, Central
America and South America.

581
01:08:21,453 --> 01:08:25,569
That's America. And not
just you, in one country?

582
01:08:35,593 --> 01:08:37,708
Heeeyyy...

583
01:08:59,593 --> 01:09:00,708
Now!

584
01:09:25,940 --> 01:09:27,054
What the fuck!

585
01:09:27,979 --> 01:09:30,207
What did I tell you!
What did I tell you!

586
01:09:32,736 --> 01:09:33,851
Stupid son of a bitch!

587
01:09:34,255 --> 01:09:36,051
You idiot! Let's go,
move it, faster idiot!

588
01:10:15,275 --> 01:10:19,312
Go... I call my family.

589
01:10:19,432 --> 01:10:21,740
Look there, the police. Look.

590
01:10:22,670 --> 01:10:24,421
Run.

591
01:10:40,061 --> 01:10:41,335
Operator may I help you?

592
01:10:41,581 --> 01:10:42,808
Yes... collect... collect to Poland.

593
01:10:43,140 --> 01:10:47,416
Hold on, I'll give you international.

594
01:10:47,697 --> 01:10:49,016
This is international can I help you?

595
01:10:49,217 --> 01:10:50,365
Yes... collect to Poland.

596
01:10:50,496 --> 01:10:51,495
Number

597
01:10:51,655 --> 01:10:55,629
7, 3, 7, 5, 5, 1, 5

598
01:10:55,813 --> 01:10:56,712
And your name?

599
01:10:56,772 --> 01:10:57,607
Veronica.

600
01:10:57,812 --> 01:10:59,580
One moment please.

601
01:11:01,134 --> 01:11:02,134
Mamma?

602
01:11:02,169 --> 01:11:04,361
Veronica, where are you?

603
01:11:05,128 --> 01:11:09,438
Mamma, I'm glad to hear your
voice. Listen, I have a problem.

604
01:11:10,165 --> 01:11:12,155
Is everything alright?
Mamma! Mamma!

605
01:11:12,404 --> 01:11:14,495
You need to leave there.
You and dad are in danger!

606
01:11:15,363 --> 01:11:17,839
Have you made it to America yet?

607
01:11:18,082 --> 01:11:19,081
Go!

608
01:11:19,641 --> 01:11:21,870
What are you saying?
With what?

609
01:11:22,240 --> 01:11:26,310
People from Agency came by.
They have shown me documents.

610
01:11:26,557 --> 01:11:28,036
They've taken them from me.

611
01:11:28,516 --> 01:11:32,951
Mamma they're gangsters.
Mamma they're holding me... help!

612
01:11:39,830 --> 01:11:45,663
Get them in the van! Hurry!

613
01:11:47,246 --> 01:11:49,754
Who did you call?
Who the fuck did you call?

614
01:11:50,264 --> 01:11:53,182
Who do you think she called asshole?
She called the cops!

615
01:11:53,703 --> 01:11:56,535
Who did you call?
Well you can forget it, you will now pay for this.

616
01:11:56,782 --> 01:11:58,214
And your son.

617
01:12:19,890 --> 01:12:22,448
Get your ass out there,
and keep it out of site.

618
01:13:14,222 --> 01:13:18,770
You pay for this, I will show you.

619
01:13:29,294 --> 01:13:38,846
No! No! No!

620
01:16:33,919 --> 01:16:34,953
Come in.

621
01:16:40,155 --> 01:16:41,190
You're late, Manuel.

622
01:16:43,034 --> 01:16:44,102
Here.

623
01:16:51,469 --> 01:16:52,663
Sit down.

624
01:16:59,185 --> 01:17:00,504
You're, probably Adriana, yes?

625
01:17:02,864 --> 01:17:03,898
Yes.

626
01:17:04,783 --> 01:17:12,174
What a beautiful name.
Is this what everyone calls you?

627
01:17:15,457 --> 01:17:18,254
You have no idea,
how to deal with young girls, do you?

628
01:17:20,295 --> 01:17:21,807
Where are the other girls?

629
01:17:29,970 --> 01:17:32,163
You hear me?
Where are the other girls?

630
01:17:33,048 --> 01:17:40,041
The Brazilians kept one of them,
and the other...

631
01:17:40,684 --> 01:17:43,754
We lost on the way here,

632
01:17:44,720 --> 01:17:46,994
She had an accident.

633
01:17:47,720 --> 01:17:48,994
Which one?

634
01:17:51,119 --> 01:17:52,346
Which one?

635
01:17:52,598 --> 01:17:54,110
The one from Poland.

636
01:17:54,957 --> 01:17:56,594
Another accident?

637
01:17:58,115 --> 01:18:02,868
One more accident, and we wouldn't
have any business at all

638
01:18:03,352 --> 01:18:04,831
Looks like you can't handle this job.

639
01:18:05,191 --> 01:18:09,068
You have to deal with Vadim on this
and it's not going to be very pleasant.

640
01:18:10,669 --> 01:18:11,896
What a loser.

641
01:18:15,666 --> 01:18:17,098
You're an imbecile.

642
01:18:19,264 --> 01:18:21,493
Let's go Adriana,
we got things to do.

643
01:18:22,702 --> 01:18:25,579
I'm leaving got to take care of business.

644
01:18:37,055 --> 01:18:39,329
Hello! Welcome to the Holiday Inn,
how may I help you?

645
01:18:39,933 --> 01:18:41,809
I need two rooms if you got them.

646
01:18:42,052 --> 01:18:43,246
Single or double, sir?

647
01:18:43,492 --> 01:18:44,606
Let's see what you got..

648
01:18:46,490 --> 01:18:51,323
It's fake.
You have internet here?

649
01:18:51,647 --> 01:18:53,239
Sure, in the amusement center over there.

650
01:18:54,046 --> 01:18:55,922
The passwords is (?), right?

651
01:18:57,324 --> 01:18:59,200
Would you like to pay on a credit card?

652
01:19:01,522 --> 01:19:05,115
Excuse me,
my wallet is here.

653
01:19:06,522 --> 01:19:08,115
Be right out.

654
01:19:11,416 --> 01:19:13,754
Hey... 2 pm

655
01:19:14,755 --> 01:19:17,347
Here is your room key,
you go up and get some rest.

656
01:19:17,834 --> 01:19:19,869
I'll be in his office,
I'm going over there now.

657
01:19:22,272 --> 01:19:25,228
Detective Sheridan, how exactly
did you get involved in this case?

658
01:19:25,630 --> 01:19:27,859
Ray not only investigates insurance fraud.

659
01:19:28,069 --> 01:19:30,627
But in resent occasions he also get's involved with...

660
01:19:31,547 --> 01:19:35,663
Detective Jefferson, no offense, but I like
to hear the story from Detective Sheridan himself.

661
01:19:36,544 --> 01:19:39,894
The bottom line is, this girl
will be auctioned of in a few hours,

662
01:19:39,942 --> 01:19:43,939
And I need to know what you
guys gonna do about that auction,

663
01:19:43,940 --> 01:19:48,455
Look we've been monitoring this
group for quit some time.

664
01:19:49,378 --> 01:19:51,492
We know where there Jersey operations are.

665
01:19:52,176 --> 01:19:54,928
Ray, the real problem is
that this thing is global

666
01:19:55,734 --> 01:19:59,850
Even though this group might be based in Mexico City,
they have operations all over the US..

667
01:20:00,492 --> 01:20:01,890
And over every one of the continents.

668
01:20:02,091 --> 01:20:05,001
Their server for example,
is located somewhere in Maldives.

669
01:20:05,529 --> 01:20:07,280
Their banking is in South Africa.

670
01:20:07,808 --> 01:20:09,718
There are many jurisdictions at work here

671
01:20:09,927 --> 01:20:12,917
CIA, State Department, the
Interpol etc... etc...

672
01:20:13,445 --> 01:20:19,152
So what we do is follow the money, connect
all the dots and we'll come up with the source.

673
01:20:20,282 --> 01:20:25,670
I get all that, but you know
where the operation is in New Jersey.

674
01:20:26,039 --> 01:20:27,038
Yeah.

675
01:20:27,838 --> 01:20:31,955
But you can't be bothered and do
anything about this little Mexican girl,

676
01:20:31,996 --> 01:20:34,863
You got bigger plans.

677
01:20:35,993 --> 01:20:40,030
That's what you're saying,
or did I hear you wrong?

678
01:20:41,391 --> 01:20:43,108
Well gentlemen, if you excuse me?

679
01:20:44,829 --> 01:20:45,863
Thanks you

680
01:20:46,428 --> 01:20:47,746
We are the fucking Gringos, aren't we?

681
01:20:49,027 --> 01:20:50,061
Sorry?

682
01:20:50,786 --> 01:20:53,617
I said we are the fucking Gringos!

683
01:21:39,561 --> 01:21:42,869
Hi Patty, I'll be home in a few more days.

684
01:21:45,238 --> 01:21:48,930
I want you to take out a big hunk
of money from our savings.

685
01:21:48,936 --> 01:21:51,870
But I don't wanna do it unless
you say it's alright.

686
01:21:52,254 --> 01:21:54,823
I guess I wont have to ask what it's for.

687
01:21:55,712 --> 01:22:00,830
I'll tell you all about it when I get home,
and I promise no more secrets.

688
01:22:01,869 --> 01:22:03,142
Have you found her?

689
01:22:05,507 --> 01:22:06,781
Karla?

690
01:22:08,346 --> 01:22:10,415
Karla that's her name?

691
01:22:13,143 --> 01:22:14,212
Yeah.

692
01:22:15,582 --> 01:22:22,098
Ray... if you find your daughter,
I want you to bring her home.

693
01:22:29,615 --> 01:22:32,111
If I do, I will.

694
01:22:32,932 --> 01:22:35,451
Patty...
Yeah?

695
01:22:38,490 --> 01:22:40,081
Thanks you

696
01:22:41,129 --> 01:22:43,358
You shouldn't thank me
for loving you, Ray.

697
01:22:45,087 --> 01:22:46,565
Bye bye.

698
01:22:56,541 --> 01:22:58,689
Hey, hey,
what's going on?

699
01:22:58,690 --> 01:23:02,717
I got us some money,
you and me gonna do the auction.

700
01:23:02,798 --> 01:23:03,932
And what about your friend?

701
01:23:04,437 --> 01:23:05,755
Forget about him.

702
01:23:09,054 --> 01:23:11,891
Sure you got tell to me something Gringo.

703
01:23:15,231 --> 01:23:16,788
Why are you doing this?

704
01:23:27,465 --> 01:23:28,533
Who is it?

705
01:23:29,984 --> 01:23:31,177
It's my daughter.

706
01:23:31,423 --> 01:23:32,696
Your daughter?

707
01:23:33,182 --> 01:23:34,296
Yeah.

708
01:23:36,340 --> 01:23:38,619
This is what you've been looking for?

709
01:23:39,419 --> 01:23:42,807
That picture was taken 10 years ago,
I really don't know what I'm looking for.

710
01:23:51,253 --> 01:23:56,005
I met her mother just after I was married

711
01:23:56,330 --> 01:24:00,965
To Patty my wife,
and I was a happily married man

712
01:24:02,767 --> 01:24:08,301
And then I met Eleanore,
and everything changed. She was...

713
01:24:12,888 --> 01:24:20,192
Oh she was so... wild and alive.

714
01:24:23,916 --> 01:24:27,350
I don't know what I was expecting
but I was ready to give up everything.

715
01:24:29,033 --> 01:24:35,024
My marriage, everything,
so stupid!  Stupid...

716
01:24:36,269 --> 01:24:42,453
And then she met this other guy and...

717
01:24:42,945 --> 01:24:48,736
He was everything I wasn't, I mean...
she found him exiting... and alive...

718
01:24:50,822 --> 01:24:56,655
Anyway and then she told to me,
that she was pregnant with his child. And a...

719
01:24:58,538 --> 01:25:04,893
That kind of did it, I left and a...
went back to Patty

720
01:25:05,134 --> 01:25:06,408
Did Patty take you back?

721
01:25:07,613 --> 01:25:08,613
Yep.

722
01:25:10,532 --> 01:25:11,930
Go figure.

723
01:25:12,531 --> 01:25:14,202
That would never happen in Mexico.

724
01:25:21,006 --> 01:25:25,713
Just a few days ago I get a knock at my door from a
couple of officers and they told me that Eleanore has died.

725
01:25:25,864 --> 01:25:27,881
From an overdose.

726
01:25:28,522 --> 01:25:31,558
And they found this letter
in her apartment with my name on it.

727
01:25:32,680 --> 01:25:35,557
That she's written 10 years
before, but never sent.

728
01:25:36,598 --> 01:25:46,991
And she says she needs money,
and that Karla is my daughter.

729
01:25:48,032 --> 01:25:51,503
Which I always... wondered about.

730
01:25:52,390 --> 01:25:54,539
You didn't know she had a daughter did you?

731
01:25:57,267 --> 01:25:58,461
I did.

732
01:26:03,984 --> 01:26:06,019
We had our ups and downs years

733
01:26:06,303 --> 01:26:09,179
We helped her out all we could,
but she's always in trouble

734
01:26:09,621 --> 01:26:10,621
And the daughter?

735
01:26:10,860 --> 01:26:14,931
In foster homes mostly,
but I always managed to get her back.

736
01:26:17,377 --> 01:26:18,775
After you.

737
01:26:27,252 --> 01:26:31,526
She went over the border to
Juarez about ten years ago.

738
01:26:31,730 --> 01:26:33,924
Probably at the time when she
wrote you that letter.

739
01:26:34,688 --> 01:26:35,916
Was her daughter with her?

740
01:26:36,447 --> 01:26:37,846
We have no idea.

741
01:26:38,406 --> 01:26:42,920
We do know, that she got back here
two years later,

742
01:26:43,106 --> 01:26:44,320
The girl was gone

743
01:26:44,442 --> 01:26:47,791
And the house was still a mess.
Did you...

744
01:26:47,819 --> 01:26:52,826
Did you ask her what happened to the daughter.

745
01:26:54,317 --> 01:26:57,549
She told us that she left her with her daddy.

746
01:26:57,574 --> 01:27:03,626
We didn't know what kind of daddy she was talking about?
We couldn't prove anything, what are you talking about?

747
01:27:03,633 --> 01:27:09,982
We think, she sold the girl
I don't know, but with junkies that happens

748
01:27:13,228 --> 01:27:14,979
She sold her.

749
01:27:18,746 --> 01:27:25,623
If I... if I gotten that letter 10 years before,
everything would be different.

750
01:27:26,063 --> 01:27:29,834
Me and Patty always wanted a child.

751
01:27:32,418 --> 01:27:33,976
She's pretty, ain't she?

752
01:27:35,737 --> 01:27:37,947
Yes, she has beautiful eyes.

753
01:27:38,775 --> 01:27:41,412
Green.. Like her mothers.

754
01:27:46,811 --> 01:27:49,983
So, that's what you where
doing in the house in Juarez.

755
01:27:50,409 --> 01:27:55,986
Well, by the time you climbed in to my trunk,
I've pretty much givin' up on everything.

756
01:27:56,807 --> 01:28:03,801
But now I realized I gave up to soon.
Which is something I do a lot of...

757
01:28:04,807 --> 01:28:05,801
I guess.

758
01:28:09,200 --> 01:28:14,710
Veronica, I hope, you are happy in heaven.
If you can talk to Virgin Mary for me,

759
01:28:14,757 --> 01:28:19,908
And ask her to have a good and
kind person buy me at the auction.

760
01:28:20,754 --> 01:28:25,064
I'm very scared. Please help me.

761
01:28:29,754 --> 01:28:30,064
Be well.

762
01:28:39,184 --> 01:28:40,377
It's started already.

763
01:28:41,663 --> 01:28:44,858
We need a name. Write: World Traveler.

764
01:28:45,341 --> 01:28:46,409
Okay.

765
01:28:54,216 --> 01:28:55,568
Alright we're in.

766
01:28:55,775 --> 01:28:57,844
One bidder is on line, at $8,000.00,

767
01:28:58,374 --> 01:28:59,772
Go $10,000.00

768
01:29:10,488 --> 01:29:12,239
Little Buddha goes to twelve.

769
01:29:12,766 --> 01:29:15,085
Try... try thirteen.

770
01:29:24,981 --> 01:29:26,332
It's fifteen now

771
01:29:26,399 --> 01:29:28,071
Go to eighteen.

772
01:29:36,394 --> 01:29:38,861
A new one from South Africa went to...

773
01:29:38,872 --> 01:29:41,371
All right. All right
21?

774
01:29:41,376 --> 01:29:42,264
Yeah.

775
01:29:54,065 --> 01:29:57,056
Please, god help, I promise, no more tricks.

776
01:29:57,503 --> 01:29:59,538
I shall not steal any more.

777
01:30:03,300 --> 01:30:04,813
Go 25.

778
01:30:12,616 --> 01:30:14,207

779
01:30:14,655 --> 01:30:19,721
All right, all right go twenty
nine. No, go to 32,000.00.

780
01:30:19,812 --> 01:30:23,325
But wait till there's only 2 seconds left

781
01:30:32,765 --> 01:30:33,834
Now!

782
01:30:40,921 --> 01:30:43,036
The auction is closed! The winner:
World Traveler.

783
01:30:43,959 --> 01:30:45,187
Thanks!

784
01:30:47,038 --> 01:30:48,436
Let's find out where she is

785
01:30:48,557 --> 01:30:49,591
Okay.

786
01:30:52,995 --> 01:30:54,063
They wanna know where we are.

787
01:30:54,394 --> 01:30:59,987
All right give them the address of the hotel
and tell them to ask for World Traveler

788
01:31:01,150 --> 01:31:02,265
Yes.

789
01:31:02,550 --> 01:31:03,743
Congratulations.

790
01:31:03,949 --> 01:31:05,142
Thank you

791
01:31:05,388 --> 01:31:09,345
You're a lucky guy,
we have your package real close by.

792
01:31:09,666 --> 01:31:10,859
Okay.

793
01:31:11,105 --> 01:31:13,140
Why are you in hotel?
You're from out of town?

794
01:31:13,504 --> 01:31:15,573
Yeah, I'm on the road a lot

795
01:31:15,943 --> 01:31:17,421
What do you do?

796
01:31:17,702 --> 01:31:19,020
I'm a sales rep.

797
01:31:19,261 --> 01:31:22,093
Well you sure got a lot of dough for a sales rep.

798
01:31:23,419 --> 01:31:26,216
You must really like virgins pussy ha?

799
01:31:26,497 --> 01:31:28,691
Oh yeah.

800
01:31:30,136 --> 01:31:33,206
You gonna get an address in your computer
we'll pick you up there.

801
01:31:33,774 --> 01:31:36,684
You bring the money,
we bring the girl, it's that simple.

802
01:31:57,841 --> 01:31:58,910
World Traveler?

803
01:31:59,200 --> 01:32:00,679
Yeah.

804
01:32:01,639 --> 01:32:02,867
You got the money?

805
01:32:06,757 --> 01:32:08,109
Where's my girl?

806
01:32:08,316 --> 01:32:09,589
Not far from here.

807
01:32:12,394 --> 01:32:14,145
Leave your car here,
we'll pick her up.

808
01:32:14,473 --> 01:32:15,700
No, I follow you.

809
01:32:15,912 --> 01:32:17,185
No, no, no.

810
01:32:17,471 --> 01:32:22,747
You get your ass over here in my car,
or there wont be virgin pussy for you today?

811
01:32:24,147 --> 01:32:26,864
But you gotta bring me back.

812
01:32:27,026 --> 01:32:28,936
Why sure. I'm your driver.

813
01:33:10,324 --> 01:33:12,041
Fuck! Fuck man!

814
01:33:24,237 --> 01:33:25,715
It's here.

815
01:33:25,916 --> 01:33:26,984
Follow me.

816
01:33:34,191 --> 01:33:35,191
Hello.

817
01:33:38,589 --> 01:33:39,941
How you doing?

818
01:33:40,508 --> 01:33:42,065
Fine, how are and you?

819
01:33:42,267 --> 01:33:45,144
Good, have a seat.

820
01:34:01,457 --> 01:34:03,890
No, no, no, give him the money.

821
01:34:14,690 --> 01:34:18,477
So? Do you like her?

822
01:34:19,168 --> 01:34:21,203
Better in person, ha?

823
01:34:22,047 --> 01:34:24,241
Very.

824
01:34:24,445 --> 01:34:26,594
Adriana say hello to the Senor.

825
01:34:31,362 --> 01:34:32,589
It's all there.

826
01:34:35,680 --> 01:34:36,953
The money is all there

827
01:34:37,359 --> 01:34:40,190
Good.
Come here.

828
01:34:41,357 --> 01:34:43,153
She's a little shy.

829
01:34:50,912 --> 01:34:52,902
Sit next to him.

830
01:35:06,724 --> 01:35:08,922
Where you from?

831
01:35:09,022 --> 01:35:11,240
Why you wanna know?

832
01:35:11,421 --> 01:35:13,219
No reason.

833
01:35:13,620 --> 01:35:14,135
No reason.

834
01:35:14,340 --> 01:35:17,727
Look you remind me of someone

835
01:35:17,898 --> 01:35:19,296
Who would that be?

836
01:35:20,137 --> 01:35:21,928
Some one I knew a long time ago.

837
01:35:22,136 --> 01:35:24,251
You're very nosey

838
01:35:24,314 --> 01:35:26,566
Are you a cop?

839
01:35:26,613 --> 01:35:28,567
No I'm not a cop.

840
01:35:28,612 --> 01:35:31,060
What do you think Manuel?
I think he's a cop.

841
01:35:31,212 --> 01:35:32,060
Get up!

842
01:35:34,029 --> 01:35:38,988
Look why don't you just give me the girl,
I'm telling you I'm not a cop

843
01:35:39,407 --> 01:35:40,481
Sit down.

844
01:35:40,486 --> 01:35:43,541
You're gonna prove you're not a cop

845
01:35:43,645 --> 01:35:45,816
Prove it how? How would I prove it?

846
01:35:45,824 --> 01:35:49,594
Easy, first fuck is here.

847
01:35:54,559 --> 01:35:55,359
Sorry?

848
01:35:55,519 --> 01:35:58,347
You gonna fuck the little virgin right here.

849
01:35:58,716 --> 01:36:01,553
That's not part of the deal.

850
01:36:01,555 --> 01:36:07,528
I know. But let's say it's kind
of my insurance policy.

851
01:36:07,593 --> 01:36:11,689
If you're not a cop, it means once
you've been with her you won't talk.

852
01:36:11,710 --> 01:36:15,187
But if you're a cop you wont
fuck her and then you're fucking death.

853
01:36:19,586 --> 01:36:21,018
You want some water?

854
01:36:25,344 --> 01:36:28,414
So, what's it gonna be?

855
01:36:32,459 --> 01:36:35,734
I think, for this amount of money
I deserved a little private.

856
01:36:35,977 --> 01:36:41,007
Sure,
you can get your very own room

857
01:36:41,068 --> 01:36:42,520
No, no, no,

858
01:36:56,068 --> 01:36:58,920
Go with him.

859
01:37:03,083 --> 01:37:05,038
You go and be a nice little girl.

860
01:37:08,441 --> 01:37:14,558
Oh and ah...
I wanna see blood on the sheets.

861
01:37:52,538 --> 01:37:57,052
It's okay...
I'm not gonna hurt you.

862
01:37:59,774 --> 01:38:05,049
Amigo...
I'm a friend of your brothers.

863
01:38:06,074 --> 01:38:07,849
Jorge...

864
01:38:08,170 --> 01:38:12,521
Jorge your brother, he's here with me.
We're gonna get you out.

865
01:38:12,528 --> 01:38:14,677
I'm not sure how exactly

866
01:38:23,562 --> 01:38:24,710
Wait.

867
01:38:45,751 --> 01:38:50,517
I don't trust this guy,
go check up them!

868
01:38:51,051 --> 01:38:52,017
Let's go!

869
01:39:30,063 --> 01:39:31,029
Manuel!

870
01:39:39,763 --> 01:39:44,629
Remember, Veronica is watching,
it's not to late.

871
01:40:39,212 --> 01:40:40,406
And?

872
01:40:51,966 --> 01:40:55,842
That son of a bitch has already justified
your so called insurance policy.

873
01:41:10,556 --> 01:41:15,068
Just what I like to see a satisfied customer

874
01:41:15,070 --> 01:41:17,468
Manuel is gonna take you back to your car.

875
01:41:37,542 --> 01:41:41,658
Adios Adriana,
good bye World Traveler.

876
01:41:55,213 --> 01:41:57,248
What a nice daddy.

877
01:42:12,037 --> 01:42:13,271
Jorge!

878
01:42:25,837 --> 01:42:28,271
Police! Police!
Drop your weapons!

879
01:42:35,353 --> 01:42:37,024
Don't move!
On the ground now!

880
01:42:40,469 --> 01:42:42,821
Don't move!
Stay on the ground!

881
01:42:46,028 --> 01:42:47,338
Stay on the ground!
Show me your hands!

882
01:42:47,986 --> 01:42:49,976
Please. Please.

883
01:42:53,803 --> 01:42:56,055
Come on!
Get up!

884
01:42:57,460 --> 01:42:58,575
All clear!

885
01:43:03,498 --> 01:43:05,696
I knew I had to keep an eye on you.

886
01:43:05,697 --> 01:43:06,496
Stop to resist!

887
01:43:06,656 --> 01:43:07,808
Don't touch me,
you pig!

888
01:43:09,334 --> 01:43:11,369
It'll be all right.

889
01:43:12,013 --> 01:43:13,127
I got to get back to base.

890
01:43:13,412 --> 01:43:14,606
Here we go.

891
01:43:15,371 --> 01:43:16,803
Thank you all.

892
01:43:17,130 --> 01:43:18,130

01:44:23,278 --> 01:44:25,213
They'll make sure you get on the
plane so you'll get home all right

901
01:44:25,495 --> 01:44:26,689
Your keys, sir.

902
01:44:26,774 --> 01:44:27,842
Thanks.

903
01:44:28,493 --> 01:44:31,451
They're good people,
trust them for once

904
01:44:31,492 --> 01:44:32,911
Can you do that?

905
01:44:33,331 --> 01:44:37,004
Okay, but you gotta come and visit us in
Mexico City, once in a while

906
01:44:37,069 --> 01:44:38,796
I'll give you a tour.

907
01:44:38,869 --> 01:44:39,796
Right.

908
01:44:42,806 --> 01:44:43,734
For you.

912
01:44:48,243 --> 01:44:50,756
You've got a good brother.
He'll look after you.

913
01:44:51,042 --> 01:44:52,190
I'll be the best.

914
01:44:56,599 --> 01:44:57,792
