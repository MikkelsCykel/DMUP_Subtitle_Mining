The following story is fictional and
does not depict any actual person or event.

2
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:08,232
In New York City's war on crime,

3
00:00:08,232 --> 00:00:11,352
the worst criminal offenders
are pursued by the detectives

4
00:00:11,352 --> 00:00:13,236
of the Major Case Squad.

5
00:00:13,236 --> 00:00:15,771
These are their stories.

6
00:00:17,712 --> 00:00:21,163
I was, I was hoping for more.

7
00:00:21,163 --> 00:00:23,947
I'll go another 500 for that Hamilton.

8
00:00:25,323 --> 00:00:28,024
No, not my father's watch.

9
00:00:28,024 --> 00:00:30,339
He gave it to me in the hospital.

10
00:00:30,339 --> 00:00:32,334
It's hard to part with family things.

11
00:00:32,334 --> 00:00:34,751
Maybe 600.

12
00:00:40,609 --> 00:00:43,003
Hope this girl's worth it.

13
00:00:43,485 --> 00:00:46,702
Sorry to be running you around like this
for just a stupid watch band.

14
00:00:46,702 --> 00:00:49,572
Miss, if I didn't sell bands,
I couldn't pay the rent.

15
00:00:49,572 --> 00:00:51,815
Spotty leopard.

16
00:00:51,815 --> 00:00:53,399
What about in back?

17
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:55,074
Anything you haven't put out yet?

18
00:00:55,074 --> 00:00:57,418
Let me check.

19
00:00:59,782 --> 00:01:05,209
M-a-r-q-u-i-s, Marquise.

20
00:01:05,209 --> 00:01:08,175
Okay. Gotta go.

21
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,080
Sorry.

22
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:24,719
Don't choke. Can't choke.

23
00:01:25,772 --> 00:01:27,962
How lucky was that?

24
00:01:27,962 --> 00:01:29,788
I'm out.

25
00:01:30,157 --> 00:01:32,984
Bitch! Let me win it back.

26
00:01:33,921 --> 00:01:36,822
Come on! Triple or nothing!

27
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:39,927
I'm in love with love.
That's what it is.

28
00:01:39,927 --> 00:01:43,435
- I thought you were set on the Marquis.
- But now I'm asking myself,

29
00:01:43,435 --> 00:01:46,238
who's the beauty,
the ring or the girl?

30
00:01:46,238 --> 00:01:51,213
Princess setting or the pear shape?

31
00:01:51,213 --> 00:01:53,316
Nice kid, but yap, yap, yap.

32
00:01:53,316 --> 00:01:55,493
Whatever you choose will be right.

33
00:01:55,493 --> 00:01:59,142
I'm nervous.
I pawned my dad's watch for this.

34
00:01:59,831 --> 00:02:01,565
Say, Mr. Pullman...

35
00:02:01,565 --> 00:02:05,365
$600 for a 1950s Hamilton.

36
00:02:05,365 --> 00:02:08,984
- You think I got ripped off?
- I'm not an expert on antique watches.

37
00:02:08,984 --> 00:02:11,078
It's eating me up.

38
00:02:11,078 --> 00:02:13,177
Is 600 fair?

39
00:02:15,501 --> 00:02:17,865
They even took my laptop.

40
00:02:17,865 --> 00:02:20,561
I'm calling 911.

41
00:02:20,725 --> 00:02:23,310
Jack, why are you in the closet?

42
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:26,441
I had some cash up here.
It's gone.

43
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,714
Shut up! Nobody move!

44
00:02:32,714 --> 00:02:33,865
You!

45
00:02:37,129 --> 00:02:39,161
Diamonds in there!

46
00:02:40,453 --> 00:02:41,597
Help her!

47
00:02:41,597 --> 00:02:43,845
Come on, faster! Go!

48
00:02:44,447 --> 00:02:48,083
Don't move! Don't move!

49
00:02:50,427 --> 00:02:52,128
Shut up!

50
00:02:52,128 --> 00:02:54,150
Go! Go! Come on!

51
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:55,410
Come on!

52
00:02:58,675 --> 00:02:59,911
Open it! / Daniel!

53
00:02:59,911 --> 00:03:02,661
- Open it!
- Daniel, buzzer's on your belt.

54
00:03:02,661 --> 00:03:04,731
Come on, open it!

55
00:03:06,148 --> 00:03:07,936
Not fast enough.

5x02 Diamond Dogs

65
00:03:54,606 --> 00:03:58,186
ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON NBC:  2005/10/02

66
00:03:59,992 --> 00:04:03,358
Everybody's got the same story.
Friendly kid, hung out 40 minutes.

67
00:04:03,358 --> 00:04:06,747
Thrilled to buy an engagement ring.
Then, boom, he flipped out.

68
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:08,310
How'd he get away?

69
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:10,582
- Foot, car, subway?
- Don't know yet.

70
00:04:10,582 --> 00:04:12,322
Let's get someone
on the street and find out.

71
00:04:12,322 --> 00:04:13,655
We got a security tape to watch?

72
00:04:13,655 --> 00:04:15,619
- Yeah, we're setting it up right now.
- Good.

73
00:04:15,619 --> 00:04:17,423
Ooh, check this out.

74
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:21,872
These are known diamond fences
in the Bronx current as of last year.

75
00:04:21,872 --> 00:04:24,159
Daniel just, uh, froze there.

76
00:04:24,159 --> 00:04:26,295
I told him the buzzer was on his belt.

77
00:04:26,295 --> 00:04:28,057
He pressed it.

78
00:04:28,404 --> 00:04:30,683
And the door opened?

79
00:04:31,647 --> 00:04:35,570
- And then what did the young man do?
- He, uh...

80
00:04:38,446 --> 00:04:40,651
just take a breath.

81
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:46,113
Take another one.

82
00:04:46,113 --> 00:04:48,937
He, uh, he said, uh,

83
00:04:48,937 --> 00:04:50,585
"not fast enough."

84
00:04:50,585 --> 00:04:53,080
Then he shot Daniel. Twice.

85
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,156
And ran out.

86
00:04:58,348 --> 00:05:03,424
Mr. Jolinari, we need you to write down
everything that was taken.

87
00:05:06,749 --> 00:05:08,916
45 caliber. That's a big gun.

88
00:05:08,916 --> 00:05:13,326
Hey, can we get a bulletin out to all
the pawnshops before they close today?

89
00:05:13,326 --> 00:05:15,041
All right, do that.

90
00:05:19,075 --> 00:05:20,016
What?

91
00:05:20,016 --> 00:05:22,333
Relax, you got the job.

92
00:05:23,007 --> 00:05:25,619
We got the tape cued up.

93
00:05:29,462 --> 00:05:31,702
40 minutes.

94
00:05:31,702 --> 00:05:34,790
Didn't knock out the camera.
It doesn't...

95
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:37,223
care who sees him.

96
00:05:37,223 --> 00:05:38,580
Hey, Barak.

97
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:41,194
Security tape'ready.

98
00:05:43,778 --> 00:05:46,343
Friendly little bastard.

99
00:05:46,521 --> 00:05:48,730
His hands in his pockets.

100
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:49,753
No prints.

101
00:05:49,753 --> 00:05:53,463
So, hmm, his idea of being a pro.

102
00:05:53,913 --> 00:05:55,636
You know, you might
want to get a cell phone.

103
00:05:55,636 --> 00:05:58,129
That way people won't think
you're talking to yourself.

104
00:05:58,129 --> 00:06:01,160
Been working alone too long.

105
00:06:01,717 --> 00:06:02,907
There he goes.

106
00:06:02,907 --> 00:06:05,572
Flared trigger guard.
Extended barrel.

107
00:06:05,572 --> 00:06:07,814
Could be an HK mark 23.

108
00:06:07,814 --> 00:06:09,679
Can you back it up?

109
00:06:12,155 --> 00:06:13,552
There.

110
00:06:13,552 --> 00:06:14,867
Freeze.

111
00:06:14,867 --> 00:06:16,255
Uh, his wrist.

112
00:06:16,255 --> 00:06:20,141
Mr. Jolinari, before
he was tapping his wrist.

113
00:06:20,141 --> 00:06:22,409
He was ranting about his father's watch.

114
00:06:22,409 --> 00:06:24,864
Uh, a 1950s Hamilton.

115
00:06:24,864 --> 00:06:28,390
He thought he'd been slicked
by a pawnbroker.

116
00:06:29,226 --> 00:06:32,088
An antique watch.

117
00:06:32,867 --> 00:06:35,848
Something else for
the pawnbroker's bulletin.

118
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,707
Home of Jack & Miriam Engles
28 Prince Street
Thursday, September 8

119
00:06:38,707 --> 00:06:41,635
Yes, this is my watch.
Where'd you find it?

120
00:06:41,635 --> 00:06:47,009
Turned up at a pawn brokers
yesterday along with these items.

121
00:06:47,194 --> 00:06:48,608
Unbelievable.

122
00:06:48,608 --> 00:06:50,066
This is our stuff.

123
00:06:50,066 --> 00:06:54,657
See? I told you it was smart
to file a report with the police.

124
00:06:54,657 --> 00:06:56,440
Is there a problem, Mr. Engles?

125
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,594
I mean, people are usually happy
to get their goods back.

126
00:06:58,594 --> 00:07:00,603
We're very lucky.

127
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:08,166
Was something else stolen
that didn't make the report?

128
00:07:08,427 --> 00:07:11,353
All right, look, pal,
this busted look on your face,
I've been there.

129
00:07:11,353 --> 00:07:16,634
So, either she tells us
or you can save us a step.

130
00:07:22,528 --> 00:07:24,155
I, uh...

131
00:07:24,594 --> 00:07:26,563
I may have had a gun.

132
00:07:26,702 --> 00:07:28,903
He did.
It was hidden in the closet.

133
00:07:28,903 --> 00:07:31,594
I told him that I didn't
want guns in the house.

134
00:07:31,594 --> 00:07:34,755
Was it an HK mark 23?

135
00:07:35,673 --> 00:07:36,920
Beautiful.

136
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,607
Who knew you were out of town?

137
00:07:38,607 --> 00:07:42,155
Only our work and my son.

138
00:07:42,155 --> 00:07:43,972
He's at Princeton.

139
00:07:43,972 --> 00:07:47,446
- Stopped the paper?
- I called on the way to the cruise ship.

140
00:07:47,446 --> 00:07:51,337
Earliest they could stop
it was three days later. Thursday.

141
00:07:51,337 --> 00:07:53,690
Your calendar clock
is off by four days.

142
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:56,489
That's because they unplugged it
when they took my laptop.

143
00:07:56,489 --> 00:07:58,299
I just forgot to reset it.

144
00:07:58,299 --> 00:08:00,985
You plugged it back in on Monday?

145
00:08:01,457 --> 00:08:03,953
Count back four days.

146
00:08:03,953 --> 00:08:06,781
It was unplugged on Thursday.

147
00:08:07,234 --> 00:08:09,915
The stop-delivery date for the newspaper.

148
00:08:09,915 --> 00:08:13,363
You wanna know who's out of town,
you ask the paperboy.

149
00:08:17,159 --> 00:08:20,184
Cherry tomatos,
they're from my garden.

150
00:08:20,969 --> 00:08:23,465
Well, what else you grow?

151
00:08:23,465 --> 00:08:25,363
Cabbage.

152
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:28,088
Polish food.

153
00:08:28,088 --> 00:08:30,403
I love pierogies.

154
00:08:30,403 --> 00:08:32,095
Are your mother's any good?

155
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:34,745
No, they weren't her thing.

156
00:08:35,662 --> 00:08:39,557
So what did Mrs. Logan make her boy?

157
00:08:40,546 --> 00:08:43,521
Rum punch.

158
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:49,069
Private joke.

159
00:08:50,693 --> 00:08:54,659
There she is. The 3:10 to Yuma.

160
00:08:56,522 --> 00:08:59,309
There's our paper boy.

161
00:09:00,282 --> 00:09:02,797
Hey, police!

162
00:09:02,797 --> 00:09:04,806
How you doing?

163
00:09:05,802 --> 00:09:07,950
Boaz?

164
00:09:09,709 --> 00:09:12,569
Hey, you got badges too, huh?

165
00:09:13,073 --> 00:09:14,451
Oh, yeah.

166
00:09:14,649 --> 00:09:18,563
I got three five-year badges.
That's for newspaper delivery.

167
00:09:18,563 --> 00:09:20,997
I got three one-year badges.

168
00:09:20,997 --> 00:09:22,871
Um, and guess what?

169
00:09:22,871 --> 00:09:25,712
I put in 18 years.

170
00:09:25,712 --> 00:09:28,495
You deliver the paper to the Engles?

171
00:09:28,495 --> 00:09:30,311
They were away last week.

172
00:09:30,311 --> 00:09:32,917
Jack, on Minetta lane,
stop delivery.

173
00:09:32,917 --> 00:09:36,805
Anybody ask if, uh, maybe
somebody went out of town?

174
00:09:36,805 --> 00:09:40,027
Maybe some guy last week?

175
00:09:41,239 --> 00:09:44,038
You don't like talking
to guys you don't know, huh?

176
00:09:44,038 --> 00:09:45,889
But you'll talk to girls?

177
00:09:45,889 --> 00:09:48,449
Only if they talk to me first.

178
00:09:48,449 --> 00:09:50,873
Last week, it was a girl
who asked you who was away?

179
00:09:50,873 --> 00:09:54,157
She was nice.
She gave me this cartoon badge.

180
00:09:54,157 --> 00:09:57,973
And guess what?
It's from Japan.

181
00:09:58,132 --> 00:09:59,995
What else do you remember about her?

182
00:09:59,995 --> 00:10:01,501
Black hair.

183
00:10:01,501 --> 00:10:04,032
And guess what? 
A hat.

184
00:10:05,905 --> 00:10:08,196
Yeah, I remember her now.

185
00:10:08,196 --> 00:10:13,753
She was in early in the day
running Daniel around for a watchband.

186
00:10:13,949 --> 00:10:16,554
Think you can improve on this sketch?

187
00:10:16,554 --> 00:10:18,313
Sure.

188
00:10:18,739 --> 00:10:22,143
The mouth was poutier.

189
00:10:24,138 --> 00:10:28,429
Tell our artist about her pouty mouth.

190
00:10:34,249 --> 00:10:35,765
He make her?

191
00:10:35,765 --> 00:10:38,124
Well, she cased the store
earlier in the day.

192
00:10:38,124 --> 00:10:40,164
Unfortunately, the security
system's inexpensive,

193
00:10:40,164 --> 00:10:42,272
so it tapes over itself every hour.

194
00:10:42,272 --> 00:10:45,199
We got no hit off the prints.
And the swag hasn't turned up anywhere.

195
00:10:45,199 --> 00:10:48,276
So three days in,
you got Nancy and Sluggo here.

196
00:10:48,276 --> 00:10:51,184
- And an ID on the weapon.
- We'll do better.

197
00:10:51,184 --> 00:10:53,218
I'm counting on it.

198
00:11:01,207 --> 00:11:03,357
Just take the jewels,
Just please take the jewels.

199
00:11:03,357 --> 00:11:07,531
- You're giving me permission?
- No, no!

200
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:18,407
Oh, Lucas, oh, my god.

201
00:11:18,815 --> 00:11:21,616
Oh, Lucas, no.

202
00:11:22,337 --> 00:11:24,472
Oh, Lucas...

203
00:11:30,889 --> 00:11:34,116
I, I saw it in his eyes.

204
00:11:34,116 --> 00:11:36,254
I thought I was gonna die.

205
00:11:36,254 --> 00:11:39,396
Then he just ran away.

206
00:11:40,376 --> 00:11:43,112
Something happen?
Somebody came in?

207
00:11:43,112 --> 00:11:45,653
He just changed his mind.

208
00:11:45,653 --> 00:11:48,206
He was looking at engagement rings.

209
00:11:48,206 --> 00:11:50,997
And he said that he was
in love with love,

210
00:11:50,997 --> 00:11:56,347
so he killed my husband of 22 years.

211
00:11:58,463 --> 00:12:01,387
I'm very sorry, Mrs. Crais.

212
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:03,076
We're gonna get someone
to take you home.

213
00:12:03,076 --> 00:12:06,616
No, I wanna stay with Lucas.

214
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:11,152
Excuse me, these marks on your blouse?

215
00:12:11,152 --> 00:12:13,305
That's where he grabbed me.

216
00:12:13,305 --> 00:12:16,245
Hey, take a look at that.

217
00:12:17,406 --> 00:12:21,607
One, two, three.

218
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:25,509
Plus two in the back wall is nine.

219
00:12:28,093 --> 00:12:30,145
He shot out the camera.
He's getting smarter.

220
00:12:30,145 --> 00:12:31,133
Angrier.

221
00:12:31,133 --> 00:12:34,735
Fired nine shots in all.
He's losing control.

222
00:12:34,735 --> 00:12:36,067
What's that?

223
00:12:36,067 --> 00:12:38,004
Pool chalk.

224
00:12:38,004 --> 00:12:39,310
It was on his hands.

225
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:42,371
Transferred to the lady's blouse
when he grabbed her.

226
00:12:42,371 --> 00:12:46,861
Maybe he played a game to steady
his nerves before he came here.

227
00:12:47,048 --> 00:12:49,360
Any good with a stick?

228
00:12:50,354 --> 00:12:53,593
Fortran's Bar
Long Island City, New York
Saturday, September 10

229
00:12:53,593 --> 00:12:56,812
This got to do will all
those sirens a couple hours ago?

230
00:12:56,812 --> 00:12:59,956
Sir, you answered our question
with a question.

231
00:13:01,292 --> 00:13:03,473
You're not hiding anything, are you?

232
00:13:03,473 --> 00:13:07,096
Okay, there was a guy
in here around 1.

233
00:13:07,096 --> 00:13:08,565
Might be this guy.

234
00:13:08,565 --> 00:13:11,058
Did he shoot any games with this crowd?

235
00:13:11,058 --> 00:13:14,816
No, people made him
as a hustler and stayed away.

236
00:13:14,816 --> 00:13:17,250
I think I left my pad in the car.

237
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:19,309
I'll be right back.

238
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,778
What's your hurry?
You got a date with a doughnut?

239
00:13:32,778 --> 00:13:35,476
Just skipping out on my tab, man.

240
00:13:43,462 --> 00:13:44,796
What's this?

241
00:13:44,796 --> 00:13:47,279
It's personal use, man.
That's all!

242
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:49,249
Try again.

243
00:13:54,602 --> 00:13:56,969
Guy made a move for the John.
Logan picked him out.

244
00:13:56,969 --> 00:13:58,654
He's one of those cops.

245
00:13:58,654 --> 00:14:00,540
Always looking for the crook in the room.

246
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:03,549
I'm telling you, man,
I don't sell no smack.

247
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:06,233
Look, you see at guy there
next to my partner?

248
00:14:06,233 --> 00:14:07,566
That's my boss.

249
00:14:07,566 --> 00:14:09,679
And if I don't come through for him,

250
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:11,776
he's gonna boot my ass
back to Staten island.

251
00:14:11,776 --> 00:14:13,957
What's that got to do with me?

252
00:14:16,775 --> 00:14:19,161
I need you to give me
something on this guy.

253
00:14:19,161 --> 00:14:21,734
But I ain't never seen him.

254
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:26,361
He's got an interesting interview style.

255
00:14:26,361 --> 00:14:28,413
Very affable.

256
00:14:28,413 --> 00:14:30,359
Cuddly cop.
Not what I expected.

257
00:14:30,359 --> 00:14:31,903
And I'll owe you.

258
00:14:31,903 --> 00:14:35,236
I'm good for it, ask anybody.
Mike Logan.

259
00:14:35,236 --> 00:14:37,340
How about it?

260
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:41,650
All right.

261
00:14:42,859 --> 00:14:47,394
Now I'm gonna pound
my fist on the table, okay?

262
00:14:51,597 --> 00:14:54,304
That's the Logan I expected.

263
00:14:57,429 --> 00:15:00,511
Mr. Kellogg has something for us.

264
00:15:01,805 --> 00:15:04,420
Your pool player came in
looking to buy from me today.

265
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:05,927
He said he was Maya's boyfriend.

266
00:15:05,927 --> 00:15:07,532
She used to be a customer.

267
00:15:07,532 --> 00:15:10,177
Then you two came in,
I figure I been set up.

268
00:15:10,177 --> 00:15:11,550
That's Maya up there.

269
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:15,342
He says she was living
in a squat on hunter near 43rd.

270
00:15:15,342 --> 00:15:17,259
Let's go get her.

271
00:15:19,324 --> 00:15:21,647
Thanks, pal.

272
00:15:25,213 --> 00:15:28,341
Whoa, back up speed racer.

273
00:15:28,832 --> 00:15:31,101
Okay! Heads up, ladies and gents.

274
00:15:31,101 --> 00:15:32,651
We got a message for the class.

275
00:15:32,651 --> 00:15:37,197
We need help finding this girl.
Her name is Maya.

276
00:15:37,197 --> 00:15:38,933
She could be in danger.

277
00:15:38,933 --> 00:15:40,352
The quicker you help us,

278
00:15:40,352 --> 00:15:42,812
the faster you go make a connection.

279
00:15:42,812 --> 00:15:44,937
Maya got pinched for shoplifting.

280
00:15:44,937 --> 00:15:46,990
She got the community service
last month.

281
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:48,734
She don't come back.

282
00:15:48,734 --> 00:15:51,160
- She leave this behind?
- Oh, mon dieu.

283
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:54,743
Same as the pin she gave
the paperboy. What's wrong?

284
00:15:57,101 --> 00:16:00,178
You're afraid of it? Why?

285
00:16:04,348 --> 00:16:07,783
He touched it.
It's bad luck.

286
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:10,636
Who touched it?

287
00:16:11,022 --> 00:16:13,450
Maya's brother Roy.
He's feeble-minded.

288
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:16,655
Maya'd bring him here.
That's his toy.

289
00:16:16,655 --> 00:16:19,942
Maya has a mentally retarded brother.

290
00:16:19,942 --> 00:16:21,990
She brought here.

291
00:16:23,534 --> 00:16:25,855
What do we got here?

292
00:16:26,726 --> 00:16:30,512
My guess, liquid methadone.

293
00:16:30,512 --> 00:16:35,694
Except these folks don't look like
high priority candidates for rehab programs.

294
00:16:35,694 --> 00:16:38,219
But Maya's brother would be.

295
00:16:40,682 --> 00:16:45,697
A mentally retarded addict'd get
fast tracked into the methadone program.

296
00:16:46,014 --> 00:16:48,478
Methadome Clinic
Long Island City, New York
Monday, September 12

297
00:16:48,478 --> 00:16:50,475
So just in case I need an interpreter,

298
00:16:50,475 --> 00:16:53,303
how many languages do you speak?

299
00:16:56,484 --> 00:17:01,548
Well, Spanish, Yiddish,
Italian, Polish, Creole.

300
00:17:01,548 --> 00:17:02,709
Some Russian.

301
00:17:02,709 --> 00:17:06,339
Some Cantonese from
working in chinatown.

302
00:17:07,684 --> 00:17:08,747
You?

303
00:17:08,747 --> 00:17:13,022
I can say "stop, police" and "what's
your sign?" in 15 different languages.

304
00:17:13,022 --> 00:17:15,285
Roy Sampson!

305
00:17:15,852 --> 00:17:18,466
No. Go, no!

306
00:17:19,258 --> 00:17:20,694
- Let's go.
- We'll take that.

307
00:17:20,694 --> 00:17:22,831
Maya, you're under arrest.

308
00:17:22,831 --> 00:17:24,997
Me? I can't abandon my brother.

309
00:17:24,997 --> 00:17:27,364
We'll get him to his group home.
Come on, Roy.

310
00:17:27,364 --> 00:17:30,557
No! / Wait, let me tell him
I love him, please.

311
00:17:30,557 --> 00:17:32,353
Give him a break, honey.

312
00:17:34,366 --> 00:17:35,529
It's the same guy, Maya.

313
00:17:35,529 --> 00:17:37,941
Robbing the same jewelry stores
you were in.

314
00:17:37,941 --> 00:17:40,500
Me at a jewelry store?

315
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,242
Do I look like I'm getting married?

316
00:17:42,242 --> 00:17:43,834
You don't wise up,

317
00:17:43,834 --> 00:17:46,302
you're gonna take the weight
for everything he's done.

318
00:17:46,302 --> 00:17:48,916
Two murders, two robberies.

319
00:17:48,916 --> 00:17:51,073
I wanna talk to my lawyer.

320
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:55,674
Fresh tracks.

321
00:17:55,674 --> 00:17:58,030
Is that all since you left the squat?

322
00:17:58,030 --> 00:18:01,092
You didn't used
to like needles, did you?

323
00:18:01,446 --> 00:18:03,909
You used to snort heroin,

324
00:18:03,909 --> 00:18:06,784
until you met this boy.

325
00:18:10,714 --> 00:18:12,405
Does he fix you up?

326
00:18:12,405 --> 00:18:13,990
Is that his idea?

327
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:16,977
Nobody tells me anything.

328
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:20,157
Lawyer.

329
00:18:26,045 --> 00:18:29,735
You're sitting in the lawyer's chair.
We need you to move.

330
00:18:34,725 --> 00:18:36,421
So she follows directions.

331
00:18:36,421 --> 00:18:37,780
What else do we know about her?

332
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:41,587
Well, a half dozen shoplifting
beefs last two years.

333
00:18:41,587 --> 00:18:43,264
Keeps getting community service, too,

334
00:18:43,264 --> 00:18:46,648
being "the caregiver of
a mentally retarded relative."

335
00:18:46,648 --> 00:18:48,636
He's a soft target,
like the paperboy.

336
00:18:48,636 --> 00:18:50,536
If it's the same girl.

337
00:18:50,536 --> 00:18:53,507
Shoplifting to robbery-homicide
in a month is quick work.

338
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:55,284
Matches her escalating heroin use.

339
00:18:55,284 --> 00:18:59,008
She went from snorting it
to spiking four or five times a day.

340
00:18:59,008 --> 00:19:01,884
She's probably keeping pace
with her boyfriend.

341
00:19:01,884 --> 00:19:04,603
Those stolen diamonds are going
straight up their arms.

342
00:19:04,603 --> 00:19:07,284
If it's the same girl.

343
00:19:07,442 --> 00:19:10,016
Call me when the lawyer gets here.

344
00:19:12,314 --> 00:19:14,676
It's gotta be her, right?

345
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:17,622
Oh, god.

346
00:19:19,473 --> 00:19:21,307
Oh, it won't open.

347
00:19:21,467 --> 00:19:23,710
Oh, god, I can't get it open.

348
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:25,120
Hurry up, Zoilo!

349
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,433
Open it!

350
00:19:26,433 --> 00:19:28,423
Be quiet, I can't get it open.

351
00:19:28,423 --> 00:19:31,096
Open it! Open it!

352
00:19:31,096 --> 00:19:34,743
Mama, please be quiet.
Be quiet. Be quiet, okay?

353
00:19:35,929 --> 00:19:38,391
- I can't get it open.
- Come on, Milo.

354
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:41,922
- Let's go!
- Get out of the way, I'll do it!

355
00:19:41,922 --> 00:19:43,660
Mama, no! I got it!

356
00:19:50,434 --> 00:19:51,824
Let's go.

357
00:20:06,388 --> 00:20:07,837
We got another one.

358
00:20:08,038 --> 00:20:09,567
Back in the Bronx.

359
00:20:10,463 --> 00:20:13,265
Same M.O., Two dead,
suspect matches ours,

360
00:20:13,265 --> 00:20:17,714
and he had an accomplice
driving the getaway car.

361
00:20:17,903 --> 00:20:20,119
A dark haired female.

362
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,986
I don't wanna hear it.

363
00:20:21,986 --> 00:20:23,984
Just get going!

364
00:20:29,626 --> 00:20:33,625
Angry, angry, angry.

365
00:20:34,736 --> 00:20:36,927
Every mom and pop he hits,
it gets worse.

366
00:20:36,927 --> 00:20:39,746
Something about happy families
this kid does not like.

367
00:20:39,746 --> 00:20:43,930
More specifically, he put
more rounds into mom than pop.

368
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:46,551
- You noticed that.
- Hard to miss.

369
00:20:47,675 --> 00:20:51,188
Okay, so, the getaway car
was a beige four-door compact.

370
00:20:51,188 --> 00:20:54,597
New York plates, no numbers.
Driver, female, white.

371
00:20:54,597 --> 00:20:57,376
Brown or black hair,
take your pick.

372
00:20:57,376 --> 00:21:01,122
And just to make it easy, sunglasses.

373
00:21:01,122 --> 00:21:02,834
Well...

374
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:04,731
Maybe Maya is a dead end.

375
00:21:04,731 --> 00:21:06,441
Oh, I'm not giving up on her yet.

376
00:21:06,441 --> 00:21:09,184
This guy could have
a harem working for him.

377
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:19,850
I'm gonna have to say...

378
00:21:20,833 --> 00:21:23,808
number five.

379
00:21:24,422 --> 00:21:27,166
Or number three.

380
00:21:27,166 --> 00:21:29,889
I, I'm sorry.
It's the mouth.

381
00:21:29,889 --> 00:21:32,550
They got the same pouty mouth.

382
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:34,549
Thank you for coming in.

383
00:21:35,111 --> 00:21:38,370
Four eye-witnesses.
Not one positive ID.

384
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:41,118
I'm so happy,
my toes are curling.

385
00:21:41,118 --> 00:21:43,181
Don't roll your eyes at me, detective.

386
00:21:43,181 --> 00:21:45,867
We're done.
Thank you for coming in.

387
00:21:46,959 --> 00:21:49,057
The tip that led to this girl?

388
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:50,647
From a smack dealer.

389
00:21:50,647 --> 00:21:52,361
He recognized her off a sketch.

390
00:21:52,361 --> 00:21:55,427
A sketch provided by
a mentally retarded paperboy?

391
00:21:55,427 --> 00:21:57,876
This was your lead, detective Logan?

392
00:21:57,876 --> 00:21:59,184
The tip was good.

393
00:21:59,184 --> 00:22:03,204
The day I can't read a dope dealer
is the day I hang it up.

394
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:10,087
A word, captain.

395
00:22:17,076 --> 00:22:20,123
This is now a press case.

396
00:22:20,123 --> 00:22:23,572
Assigning a cop with
an asterisk next to his name

397
00:22:23,572 --> 00:22:25,346
could come back to bite you.

398
00:22:25,346 --> 00:22:27,802
I knew that going in, counselor.

399
00:22:27,802 --> 00:22:30,444
But thanks for reminding me.
Anything else?

400
00:22:30,444 --> 00:22:32,781
Yes, you can release Maya Sampson.

401
00:22:32,781 --> 00:22:37,741
I'm not wasting resources
on a misdemeanor drug sale.

402
00:22:41,436 --> 00:22:44,528
The DA declines to file charges.
We're kicking the girl.

403
00:22:44,528 --> 00:22:47,496
- It's a mistake.
- We're letting her go.

404
00:22:48,717 --> 00:22:50,088
Captain.

405
00:22:52,437 --> 00:22:54,814
I don't wanna become an issue here.

406
00:22:54,814 --> 00:22:56,555
You quitting?

407
00:22:56,555 --> 00:22:58,114
No.

408
00:22:58,301 --> 00:23:00,230
But the bodies are piling up.

409
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:02,155
Look, it's not about
me making a bust.

410
00:23:02,155 --> 00:23:04,392
It's about catching this guy.

411
00:23:04,392 --> 00:23:08,345
You become a problem for me,
I'll be the first to tell you.

412
00:23:11,477 --> 00:23:13,330
Here's a lost opportunity.

413
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:16,326
Maya's mother is downstairs
looking for her daughter.

414
00:23:16,326 --> 00:23:19,433
An hour earlier, she could
have helped us get through to her.

415
00:23:19,433 --> 00:23:22,294
Be nice to spend some
quality time with these two.

416
00:23:22,294 --> 00:23:25,224
Maya's been without a fix for...

417
00:23:26,211 --> 00:23:27,741
12 hours.

418
00:23:27,741 --> 00:23:31,158
Be remiss if we didn't let
a doctor look at her.

419
00:23:33,193 --> 00:23:36,412
They told me at Roy's
group home what happened.

420
00:23:36,412 --> 00:23:39,842
I can't hardly believe it.
Maya's always been good to her brother.

421
00:23:39,842 --> 00:23:42,282
Sounds like you haven't
seen her in a while.

422
00:23:42,282 --> 00:23:44,556
She came home for a week
about two months ago

423
00:23:44,556 --> 00:23:47,200
and then off she went.

424
00:23:48,403 --> 00:23:50,953
Do you have idea what
she's gotten herself into?

425
00:23:50,953 --> 00:23:52,788
- You mean the drugs?
- No.

426
00:23:52,788 --> 00:23:56,709
We mean a mad-dog boyfriend
who robs jewelry stores and kills people.

427
00:23:56,709 --> 00:23:59,063
Mad dog?

428
00:23:59,063 --> 00:24:01,560
That is a joke, right?
You're getting me worried here.

429
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,306
It's no joke.

430
00:24:06,716 --> 00:24:11,932
The district attorney's willing to be
lenient with Maya if she helps us.

431
00:24:11,932 --> 00:24:14,848
Oh, excuse me.

432
00:24:16,218 --> 00:24:18,391
She's showing early signs of withdrawal.

433
00:24:18,391 --> 00:24:23,426
But unless she wants to check herself
into detox, it's time to street her.

434
00:24:26,151 --> 00:24:29,521
The doctor told her she could leave.

435
00:24:29,889 --> 00:24:31,806
Did you tell her
what we talked about?

436
00:24:31,806 --> 00:24:33,859
She says she wasn't
mixed up in any of it.

437
00:24:33,859 --> 00:24:35,618
Like she'd tell you?

438
00:24:35,618 --> 00:24:36,793
She would.

439
00:24:36,793 --> 00:24:38,897
Come on, sweetie, get dressed.

440
00:24:39,056 --> 00:24:40,413
You've got her confused
with someone else.

441
00:24:40,413 --> 00:24:42,164
I don't think we have.

442
00:24:42,164 --> 00:24:44,785
I know my girl.
She has been in enough trouble.

443
00:24:44,785 --> 00:24:46,512
All those hours of com-service.

444
00:24:46,512 --> 00:24:49,781
Cleaning graffiti off the walls
with the stinking solvent.

445
00:24:49,781 --> 00:24:52,386
She has learned her lesson.
Right, sweetie?

446
00:24:52,386 --> 00:24:54,215
Come on, let's go.

447
00:24:55,683 --> 00:24:58,137
Thank you, officers.

448
00:25:04,463 --> 00:25:05,861
Some mom.

449
00:25:05,861 --> 00:25:09,586
A mom who doesn't get upset her
daughter strips in front of strangers.

450
00:25:09,586 --> 00:25:12,024
My mom would have killed me.

451
00:25:12,467 --> 00:25:16,991
This mom knew a little
too much about "com-service."

452
00:25:17,145 --> 00:25:21,314
Nurse, we're gonna need
fingerprints off of that.

453
00:25:21,766 --> 00:25:23,611
Community Service Detail #9
El Train Overpass
Queens, New York
Wednesday, September 14

454
00:25:23,611 --> 00:25:27,743
Sure, she did 100 hours a month ago
for possession of drug paraphernalia.

455
00:25:27,743 --> 00:25:29,243
Dede. Dede Feist.

456
00:25:29,243 --> 00:25:32,691
Or Dede Worchak, or Dede Carbone.

457
00:25:32,691 --> 00:25:34,880
Yeah, that gal told me
she'd had a few husbands.

458
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:38,462
She's in love with love,
that is how she put it.

459
00:25:39,112 --> 00:25:41,708
This girl was on Dede's crew.

460
00:25:41,708 --> 00:25:43,471
Maya Sampson.

461
00:25:43,471 --> 00:25:44,850
She and Dede were tight.

462
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:47,041
- They know each other before?
- Don't think so,

463
00:25:47,041 --> 00:25:48,938
but by the end of the week,

464
00:25:48,938 --> 00:25:51,155
Dede was sharing
her box lunch with Maya.

465
00:25:51,155 --> 00:25:53,004
Then they were showing up together.

466
00:25:53,004 --> 00:25:56,176
I heard Dede talking to Maya
about introducing her to her son.

467
00:25:56,176 --> 00:25:58,531
I read something
about a son in her file.

468
00:25:58,531 --> 00:26:02,564
Went into foster care
when he was 11.

469
00:26:02,564 --> 00:26:04,404
- There it is, Jonathan?
- Johnny.

470
00:26:04,404 --> 00:26:05,758
That's what she called him.

471
00:26:05,758 --> 00:26:08,661
You have any idea where this
roof over her head might be? / No.

472
00:26:08,661 --> 00:26:10,278
Another thing is,
she was late one day

473
00:26:10,278 --> 00:26:13,322
because she said she had
to put her sick aunt in a hospice.

474
00:26:13,322 --> 00:26:15,203
Yeah, well, these junkies,
they break your heart.

475
00:26:15,203 --> 00:26:16,964
That's what I thought.

476
00:26:16,964 --> 00:26:18,580
So I called the hospice.

477
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:19,936
It checked out.

478
00:26:19,936 --> 00:26:22,257
St. Timothy's in Forest hills.

479
00:26:22,257 --> 00:26:23,940
Thank you very much.

480
00:26:24,601 --> 00:26:29,318
Well, if the aunt's in the hospice,
I wonder who's feeding the cat.

481
00:26:33,397 --> 00:26:34,657
Bedroom clear!

482
00:26:34,836 --> 00:26:37,385
- Bathroom clear!
- Closet clear!

483
00:26:46,002 --> 00:26:47,703
Found the cat.

484
00:26:48,142 --> 00:26:50,637
Dissociative cutting.

485
00:26:50,637 --> 00:26:53,849
Self-mutilation, turned outward.

486
00:26:53,849 --> 00:26:55,560
Little Johnny's got issues.

487
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,958
From shallow to deep.

488
00:26:57,958 --> 00:27:00,833
The angrier he gets,
the harder he stabs.

489
00:27:00,833 --> 00:27:03,520
Hard to see where he gets the energy
with all the smack they're shooting.

490
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,328
I'm seeing hundreds
of empty dime bags.

491
00:27:06,328 --> 00:27:08,030
Well, Dede's the lifetime addict.

492
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:10,168
She's doing 15, 20 bags a day.

493
00:27:10,168 --> 00:27:14,283
Some parents send their kids out
to get them booze.

494
00:27:14,283 --> 00:27:18,400
Dede has Johnny knocking off
jewelry stores to feed her habit.

495
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,364
No personal effects, no clothes.

496
00:27:21,364 --> 00:27:22,699
No makeup.

497
00:27:22,699 --> 00:27:25,632
Yeah, they flew the coop.

498
00:27:26,176 --> 00:27:27,698
Hey...

499
00:27:28,685 --> 00:27:30,964
black wig.

500
00:27:33,601 --> 00:27:36,812
The one Dede wore
to ride the getaway car.

501
00:28:01,703 --> 00:28:03,350
Oh, man.

502
00:28:04,205 --> 00:28:07,645
They were shooting up
right on top of her.

503
00:28:07,797 --> 00:28:10,566
That's just...

504
00:28:14,201 --> 00:28:15,865
I miss her, mom.

505
00:28:15,865 --> 00:28:18,446
The police have her, Johnny.

506
00:28:18,834 --> 00:28:20,914
There's nothing we can do.

507
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:22,217
We...

508
00:28:22,430 --> 00:28:23,914
We could bust her out!

509
00:28:23,914 --> 00:28:26,227
Don't be stupid.

510
00:28:26,495 --> 00:28:27,982
I'll get you another.

511
00:28:27,982 --> 00:28:30,233
Next one's for Maya!

512
00:28:33,887 --> 00:28:39,133
Maya didn't just OD.
She sent the tox screen off the chart.

513
00:28:39,834 --> 00:28:42,655
Whether it's an accident or not,
it's impossible to know.

514
00:28:42,655 --> 00:28:43,633
They killed her.

515
00:28:43,633 --> 00:28:45,656
They couldn't take a chance
she'd get pinched again.

516
00:28:45,656 --> 00:28:47,357
Any idea where they might be heading?

517
00:28:47,357 --> 00:28:50,169
Oh, who knows?
Have smack, will travel.

518
00:28:50,169 --> 00:28:53,467
The getaway car belonged to aunt Ruthie.
We got a tri-state alarm out.

519
00:28:53,467 --> 00:28:56,212
You got Dede's file.
Start working her known contacts.

520
00:28:56,212 --> 00:28:59,024
Abusive ex-husbands, boyfriends

521
00:28:59,024 --> 00:29:02,620
it's what she's had to put up with
in order to support her habit.

522
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:04,419
Let me get out my violin.

523
00:29:04,419 --> 00:29:06,239
I'll make sure Mr. Carver sees this.

524
00:29:06,239 --> 00:29:08,728
It's always good to share the pain.

525
00:29:12,483 --> 00:29:16,212
I was taught in catechism, even
the worst sinner deserves our compassion.

526
00:29:16,212 --> 00:29:20,153
Yeah? Yours, maybe.
I'll save mine.

527
00:29:20,153 --> 00:29:21,821
These dumps off aunt Ruthie's phone.

528
00:29:21,821 --> 00:29:27,286
Two hours after each robbery
there's four, five calls to the same pool hall.

529
00:29:27,286 --> 00:29:30,025
Pepe's in Brooklyn.
And only after each robbery.

530
00:29:30,025 --> 00:29:33,451
Maybe Johnny's got a pool hall fence.

531
00:29:40,485 --> 00:29:42,958
Third table on the right.

532
00:29:42,958 --> 00:29:44,607
The tall guy.

533
00:29:44,607 --> 00:29:47,918
He's got a jeweler's loop
hanging around his neck.

534
00:29:49,786 --> 00:29:51,008
Hi.

535
00:29:51,738 --> 00:29:55,200
We're getting engaged.
I'm looking for a diamond solitaire.

536
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,874
I'm not in the jewelry business.

537
00:29:57,874 --> 00:29:59,460
Yeah, you sure?

538
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:01,341
I'm sure.

539
00:30:03,977 --> 00:30:04,983
What's the loop for?

540
00:30:04,983 --> 00:30:07,778
So you can find your Jingus
when you take a leak?

541
00:30:07,778 --> 00:30:09,708
You fencing rocks for Johnny Feist?

542
00:30:09,708 --> 00:30:12,790
I don't know no Johnny Feist.

543
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:14,408
You know, I had a partner.

544
00:30:14,408 --> 00:30:17,173
Oh, what a great stick man he was.

545
00:30:17,173 --> 00:30:21,199
Here's something he had way
too much decency to teach me.

546
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:24,905
What are you gonna do with that, huh?

547
00:30:26,981 --> 00:30:29,514
I'm a rageaholic cop who took
a swing at a city councilman.

548
00:30:29,514 --> 00:30:31,468
Everybody thinks
that I'm a ticking bomb.

549
00:30:31,468 --> 00:30:33,997
Maybe today's the day I blow.
I don't know. It's up to you.

550
00:30:33,997 --> 00:30:36,057
Come on, man.
This is sick, man.

551
00:30:36,057 --> 00:30:38,784
- Don't hurt me.
- Hurt you? Hurt you?

552
00:30:38,784 --> 00:30:40,807
How much you pay Johnny
for those rocks?

553
00:30:40,807 --> 00:30:42,937
You profit by the people he kills.

554
00:30:42,937 --> 00:30:44,731
You encourage him to kill more.

555
00:30:44,731 --> 00:30:47,636
I have absolutely zero
compassion for you.

556
00:30:47,636 --> 00:30:49,568
You know what?
Rudy's not the mayor anymore.

557
00:30:49,568 --> 00:30:52,243
But that doesn't mean
we still can't have some fun.

558
00:30:52,243 --> 00:30:55,474
Man, okay, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

559
00:30:55,474 --> 00:30:56,916
I'll tell you.

560
00:30:56,916 --> 00:31:00,598
Johnny came in yesterday.
He took his money and went to AC.

561
00:31:00,598 --> 00:31:03,032
- He's gambling.
- He's playing for the big score.

562
00:31:03,032 --> 00:31:06,384
He's going on about
some papoose that loved him.

563
00:31:06,384 --> 00:31:07,658
Say what?

564
00:31:07,658 --> 00:31:14,065
Uh, it's a nickname for a nickel slot casino
outside the Atlantic city bus station.

565
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:17,260
Thanks, pal.

566
00:31:17,553 --> 00:31:20,682
Keno-Sabe Casino
Atlantic City, New Jersey
Saturday, September 17

567
00:31:20,682 --> 00:31:22,312
They came in late last night.

568
00:31:22,312 --> 00:31:24,094
Went straight to the crap table.

569
00:31:24,094 --> 00:31:26,282
Dede keeps egging him on.

570
00:31:26,743 --> 00:31:30,197
Rubbing his shoulders,
playing with his hair.

571
00:31:30,197 --> 00:31:32,665
Like he's her toy poodle.

572
00:31:33,387 --> 00:31:35,438
Bust out.
How much he lose?

573
00:31:35,438 --> 00:31:37,186
Everything he had, about 12 grand.

574
00:31:37,186 --> 00:31:40,392
Half a million in jewelry.
Fence takes his cut.

575
00:31:40,392 --> 00:31:43,554
What they don't spend
on smack he loses in...

576
00:31:43,554 --> 00:31:44,969
57 minutes.

577
00:31:44,969 --> 00:31:47,155
Uh, can you back up there, please?

578
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:48,448
There.

579
00:31:49,054 --> 00:31:51,034
Yeah, right there.

580
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:55,233
That's three times she's
chatted up this waitress.

581
00:31:56,362 --> 00:31:57,913
Dede?

582
00:31:58,256 --> 00:32:00,689
She kept singing her boy's praises.

583
00:32:00,689 --> 00:32:02,478
She was selling you on him.

584
00:32:02,478 --> 00:32:05,764
And you know, a gambling
addiction is such a turn on.

585
00:32:05,764 --> 00:32:09,390
Hey, that's a ring around your neck.
Is that an engagement ring?

586
00:32:10,057 --> 00:32:11,307
Thanks.

587
00:32:11,307 --> 00:32:13,912
I could lose my job
is the customers saw this.

588
00:32:13,912 --> 00:32:16,963
A cocktail waitress
has to seem available.

589
00:32:16,963 --> 00:32:19,758
- Did Dede see that?
- She looked disappointed.

590
00:32:19,758 --> 00:32:21,347
Then she asked where we got it.

591
00:32:21,347 --> 00:32:23,757
So I told her,
double down's jewelry.

592
00:32:23,757 --> 00:32:25,991
Across from the trop.

593
00:32:27,726 --> 00:32:30,573
Double Down Jewelry

594
00:32:43,333 --> 00:32:45,704
You okay, sweetie?

595
00:32:46,619 --> 00:32:49,746
I just lost my job cleaning rooms

596
00:32:49,746 --> 00:32:53,449
and my boyfriend took off
with my savings.

597
00:32:53,449 --> 00:32:55,263
I'll tell you what.

598
00:32:55,263 --> 00:32:58,846
I can spare a few dollars
if you help me fold this.

599
00:33:00,568 --> 00:33:02,064
Here, sweetie.

600
00:33:02,405 --> 00:33:05,981
You can start with my son's T-shirts.

601
00:33:05,981 --> 00:33:08,402
He's at work right now.

602
00:33:08,645 --> 00:33:10,033
Hey.

603
00:33:10,255 --> 00:33:12,888
Can I get a smile?

604
00:33:14,989 --> 00:33:19,154
Who's the real beauty,
the ring or the girl?

605
00:33:19,690 --> 00:33:21,765
What do you think, ring or girl?

606
00:33:21,765 --> 00:33:24,463
Oh, I have to go with the girl.
Always the girl.

607
00:33:24,463 --> 00:33:26,814
Like my Rosie.

608
00:33:26,989 --> 00:33:28,537
I'm with him.

609
00:33:28,537 --> 00:33:31,000
Go with the girl.

610
00:33:31,329 --> 00:33:34,187
But then, I'm in love with love.

611
00:33:40,476 --> 00:33:42,069
Where is she, Johnny?

612
00:33:42,245 --> 00:33:43,160
Where's your mother?

613
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:45,632
Every cop in this city
has a shoot to kill order.

614
00:33:45,632 --> 00:33:47,083
You don't want anything
to happen to her, do you?

615
00:33:47,083 --> 00:33:48,774
She's got nothing
to do with this!

616
00:33:48,774 --> 00:33:51,446
You can't believe
what Maya told you!

617
00:33:51,608 --> 00:33:54,937
My mom doesn't even know I'm in here!
She's just out being a mom!

618
00:33:54,937 --> 00:33:56,867
Where?

619
00:34:03,859 --> 00:34:06,084
Drop the laundry bag, Dede!

620
00:34:10,442 --> 00:34:12,693
The future Mrs. Johnny Feist?

621
00:34:13,333 --> 00:34:14,926
Let's go.

622
00:34:16,023 --> 00:34:18,440
Of course I can charge
his mother as an accomplice.

623
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:22,173
But that charge would have
the life span of a flea.

624
00:34:22,173 --> 00:34:24,689
There's nothing in here
that sustains it.

625
00:34:24,689 --> 00:34:28,260
Unless he testifies against his mother.

626
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:30,753
- What will it take?
- What are you prepared to offer?

627
00:34:30,753 --> 00:34:33,345
Minimum, he's facing four life
sentences without parole.

628
00:34:33,345 --> 00:34:36,037
You could offer him a walk,
but he's not gonna roll on her.

629
00:34:36,037 --> 00:34:38,273
He's not out to save his own skin.

630
00:34:38,273 --> 00:34:40,620
You need to get through
to this kid.

631
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:44,158
He doesn't seem to know
that Maya's dead.

632
00:34:44,158 --> 00:34:46,540
Dede's the one that
gave her the hot shot.

633
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:49,269
Now, Johnny boy might not be too
thrilled when we tell him.

634
00:34:49,269 --> 00:34:52,878
A child's relationship
with an addicted parent...

635
00:34:52,878 --> 00:34:55,705
is very complicated.

636
00:34:55,705 --> 00:35:00,534
If we wanna turn him against her,
anger is just the beginning.

637
00:35:01,209 --> 00:35:05,181
Four concurrent sentences
of 25 to life.

638
00:35:05,181 --> 00:35:07,960
District attorney won't oppose
parole after 25 years.

639
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,982
That's the offer in writing.

640
00:35:09,982 --> 00:35:11,320
An interesting offer.

641
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:14,947
Considering the evidence against him,
it should come with a bow on it.

642
00:35:14,947 --> 00:35:17,399
All he has to do
is give up his mother.

643
00:35:17,399 --> 00:35:20,196
She doesn't know anything.
I told you.

644
00:35:20,196 --> 00:35:22,231
By all rights, Johnny,
you shouldn't even be here.

645
00:35:22,231 --> 00:35:24,783
You were getting along fine
in your foster home.

646
00:35:24,783 --> 00:35:26,310
Is it your idea to leave?

647
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:28,064
Or was it Dede's?

648
00:35:28,064 --> 00:35:31,597
How did she put it like
I can't get along without him?

649
00:35:35,310 --> 00:35:39,460
Hey, if you wanna vent on your mom,
you've got our permission.

650
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:41,815
I got nothing to vent.

651
00:35:41,815 --> 00:35:44,628
I'm not angry at her.

652
00:35:44,961 --> 00:35:49,384
My partner knows
about that kind of anger.

653
00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:54,594
His mother used to send him out
to buy booze for her.

654
00:35:55,514 --> 00:35:58,857
Tell Johnny how
she used to thank you.

655
00:35:58,857 --> 00:36:01,768
He needs to hear it.

656
00:36:10,405 --> 00:36:16,918
Well, after the first drink,
it was all hugs and kisses.

657
00:36:17,127 --> 00:36:22,193
Then a few drinks later,
she'd grab whatever she could...

658
00:36:22,552 --> 00:36:25,481
and start hitting me.

659
00:36:25,481 --> 00:36:30,770
And when she got tired of holding
whatever it was she was hitting me with...

660
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:34,910
she'd just go at me with her fists.

661
00:36:36,843 --> 00:36:38,852
And, uh...

662
00:36:39,582 --> 00:36:42,585
the next day...

663
00:36:43,890 --> 00:36:47,396
she'd send me back to the liquor store.

664
00:36:47,593 --> 00:36:50,914
Isn't that what
your mom's done to you?

665
00:36:50,914 --> 00:36:53,341
Just turned you into her errand boy?

666
00:36:53,341 --> 00:36:55,860
Go out and steal for her
to feed her addiction?

667
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:57,321
It's not the same.

668
00:36:57,321 --> 00:36:58,924
You're right.

669
00:36:58,924 --> 00:37:02,472
My mother didn't make me
drink with her.

670
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:07,973
You didn't even have a drug problem
until you went to live with your mother.

671
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,268
- You have every right to be angry at her.
- I'm not angry.

672
00:37:11,268 --> 00:37:15,596
You're not angry
but you pumped seven bullets
into that woman in the Bronx!

673
00:37:15,596 --> 00:37:19,395
You take out your anger everywhere
you can except for where it belongs.

674
00:37:19,395 --> 00:37:21,386
She lights your smokes,
she fluffs up your hair.

675
00:37:21,386 --> 00:37:22,889
You're her poodle boy, Johnny.

676
00:37:22,889 --> 00:37:24,784
- Does she let you eat off her plate?
- You shut up!

677
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:27,457
And the one thing that your mother
couldn't provide for you,

678
00:37:27,457 --> 00:37:31,093
she found somebody who would.

679
00:37:32,622 --> 00:37:35,481
Maya's a pretty girl.

680
00:37:36,332 --> 00:37:38,847
You like her, don't you?

681
00:37:39,772 --> 00:37:41,663
You turned her against us.

682
00:37:41,663 --> 00:37:43,435
We didn't have the chance.

683
00:37:43,435 --> 00:37:46,014
We had to let her go.
Your mother picked her up.

684
00:37:46,014 --> 00:37:46,872
That's not true.

685
00:37:46,872 --> 00:37:49,247
She must have brought her back
to aunt Ruthie's while you were out,

686
00:37:49,247 --> 00:37:53,149
gave her a welcome home fix.
Tucked her in, like a good mother does.

687
00:37:53,149 --> 00:37:56,444
Did you sit up on the couch that night?
Feet up on the trunk?

688
00:37:56,444 --> 00:38:01,673
While your mother told you what
an ungrateful disloyal girl Maya was?

689
00:38:01,673 --> 00:38:04,643
How could you, you bitch!

690
00:38:04,918 --> 00:38:07,500
She was mine!

691
00:38:07,699 --> 00:38:12,676
You had no right!
You lying bitch! Oh, god.

692
00:38:15,401 --> 00:38:17,180
No!

693
00:38:18,213 --> 00:38:21,647
What are you gonna
do about this, Johnny?

694
00:38:22,393 --> 00:38:25,144
You wanna tell us what happened?

695
00:38:26,979 --> 00:38:31,083
How your mother helped you
with the robberies?

696
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:41,141
Maybe we should get you a soda.

697
00:38:59,914 --> 00:39:01,570
Yeah.

698
00:39:01,932 --> 00:39:05,128
I bet you're sorry now, huh?

699
00:39:05,128 --> 00:39:06,435
All that anger.

700
00:39:06,435 --> 00:39:09,969
What did you call her?
A lying bitch?

701
00:39:12,497 --> 00:39:14,925
She can't help herself.

702
00:39:14,925 --> 00:39:17,622
It's the heroin.

703
00:39:17,838 --> 00:39:20,452
Look at her, the poor thing.

704
00:39:20,452 --> 00:39:24,060
I wonder how she'll do back
on the street without your help.

705
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:26,552
I do worry about that.

706
00:39:26,859 --> 00:39:31,534
- Right now, I'm worrying about that.
- Of course you are.

707
00:39:31,534 --> 00:39:34,190
After all, she's not a street person.

708
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:36,053
She's your mom.

709
00:39:36,053 --> 00:39:38,788
She could go back
to one of her boyfriends.

710
00:39:38,788 --> 00:39:40,898
Real Romeos.

711
00:39:41,066 --> 00:39:44,568
This guy put her in the hospital twice.
Broken jaw, concussion.

712
00:39:44,568 --> 00:39:47,262
She won't just be with anybody.

713
00:39:47,262 --> 00:39:50,099
She's got a $300-a-day habit, Johnny.

714
00:39:50,099 --> 00:39:52,029
She'll be with whoever can pay for it.

715
00:39:52,029 --> 00:39:53,363
Can't...

716
00:39:53,748 --> 00:39:56,394
Can't you put her in a program?

717
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:59,041
She needs long term care, Johnny.

718
00:39:59,041 --> 00:40:01,215
That's for rich people.

719
00:40:01,215 --> 00:40:06,212
People like your mother are lucky
to get 72 hours in Bellevue.

720
00:40:07,493 --> 00:40:10,946
Hey, how about this guy, Lippman?

721
00:40:10,946 --> 00:40:14,757
Yeah, two years ago, he threw her
half naked out of a moving car.

722
00:40:14,757 --> 00:40:17,413
Oh, sorry, that wasn't a boyfriend.
That was one of her Johns.

723
00:40:17,413 --> 00:40:18,845
Don't tell me that!

724
00:40:18,845 --> 00:40:21,167
A junkie's gotta do what a junkie's gotta do.
You know that.

725
00:40:21,167 --> 00:40:23,843
Johnny, we wanna protect her.

726
00:40:24,002 --> 00:40:26,474
You don't want her
to go back to that life.

727
00:40:26,474 --> 00:40:27,985
What if...

728
00:40:27,985 --> 00:40:33,224
you just put her someplace
for her own protection?

729
00:40:33,224 --> 00:40:35,548
We don't just lock people up
for their health.

730
00:40:35,548 --> 00:40:38,073
You tell us what she did,
she'll go to prison.

731
00:40:38,073 --> 00:40:41,354
A woman's prison with a hospital.

732
00:40:42,901 --> 00:40:47,351
It's just better than
what she's looking at now.

733
00:40:49,484 --> 00:40:51,066
Look at her.

734
00:40:51,066 --> 00:40:54,610
You don't want her 60 years old
turning tricks to support her habit.

735
00:40:54,610 --> 00:40:59,202
I've seen women like that, Johnny.
And it is not pretty.

736
00:40:59,896 --> 00:41:05,212
Your mom, she deserves better.

737
00:41:10,555 --> 00:41:15,146
I wanted to pawn that gun
after I stole it.

738
00:41:15,146 --> 00:41:20,569
But mom said to use it
to do jewelry stores.

739
00:41:20,569 --> 00:41:23,022
She knew the ones to hit.

740
00:41:23,022 --> 00:41:25,656
She drove me to them.

741
00:41:25,836 --> 00:41:27,724
She said...

742
00:41:28,904 --> 00:41:32,847
"Better not leave witnesses."

743
00:41:33,397 --> 00:41:35,651
"Use the gun."

744
00:41:35,651 --> 00:41:40,704
"Step up and be a man.
Take care of your mom."

745
00:41:40,704 --> 00:41:43,407
That's what she told me.

746
00:41:43,407 --> 00:41:45,752
"Be a man."

747
00:41:54,354 --> 00:41:56,621
Oh, about time.

748
00:41:56,807 --> 00:41:58,000
You letting me out?

749
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,737
You're being charged with murder, Dede.

750
00:42:01,294 --> 00:42:03,021
What?

751
00:42:03,021 --> 00:42:06,529
- Your son gave you up.
- Johnny? Never.

752
00:42:06,858 --> 00:42:08,859
Not my Johnny.

753
00:42:14,628 --> 00:42:16,412
Johnny...

754
00:42:17,436 --> 00:42:20,377
You go to hell, Johnny.

755
00:42:22,718 --> 00:42:24,682
Do you hear me?
You go to hell.

756
00:42:24,682 --> 00:42:26,810
I should have left you
in that foster home.

757
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:28,828
Should have left you
in that foster home!

758
00:42:28,828 --> 00:42:31,222
Who would have mothered
you then, Johnny, huh?

759
00:42:31,222 --> 00:42:33,414
You answer me, some foster mother?

760
00:42:33,414 --> 00:42:35,770
There is no mothering
like real mothering!

761
00:42:35,770 --> 00:42:37,203
You hear me, Johnny!

762
00:42:37,203 --> 00:42:38,265
Go to hell!

763
00:42:38,265 --> 00:42:40,295
You got no one, Johnny.

764
00:42:40,295 --> 00:42:42,233
You're all alone.

765
00:42:53,209 --> 00:42:57,227
Should have warned him
don't expect any thanks.
