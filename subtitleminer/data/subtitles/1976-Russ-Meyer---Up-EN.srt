1
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:15,655
THIS IS NOT
A TALE OF FEES. 

2
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:20,370
Hello!

3
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:24,776
I am your ancient chorus.

4
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:26,254
The incarnation

5
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:31,093
body,
your sherpa of suspense.

6
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:37,213
Take my hand and if you dare,

7
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:39,252
declad your sword.

8
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:41,049
Ready Etes you?

9
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:52,859
MEGAVIXENS

10
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:57,250
September 19 9h47

11
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:30,291
You manias better the whip!

12
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:35,251
My old friend Roehm
would have been impressed.

13
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:54,375
Limehouse!

14
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:39,214
We draw.
Let us go by car in Salmon Creek

15
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:42,533
to swim and treat to good time.

16
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:44,697
You will return by bus.

17
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:18,614
You did not forget
something?

18
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,738
Your task is not finished.

19
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,489
I am washed.

20
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,019
Which is this name...

21
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:28,255
Cursed English...

22
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:31,969
Ah yes! A no-claims bonus!

23
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:36,410
Exact, ducon.
Bring or keep silent yourself.

24
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:42,291
How much?

25
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:46,059
I will be generous.

26
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:53,890
Approach...
bridal layer.

27
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:51,969
Didn't you forget anything?

28
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:58,371
In my wallet...

29
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,972
a ticket of 100 marks.

30
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,452
Thank you for the no-claims bonus.

31
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:19,688
Come here!

32
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:24,253
I said "come here"! Schnell!

33
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:34,290
And for the 2nd ticket of 100 DM?

34
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:36,655
Quickly. I am in a hurry.

35
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:07,137
In Thursday, Adolf!

36
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:09,455
Even hour!

37
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:23,335
Eh, Gwendolyn...

38
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:25,969
Soft Alice, I will climb you.

39
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,458
As I said...

40
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:32,455
Wait a little.

41
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:35,893
Let us speak initially.

42
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,419
Idles a little...

43
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:42,931
Good God, wait!

44
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:37,211
I charge you
to unearth a super trick.

45
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:39,490
This gode, it is pure poetry!

46
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:44,972
Begin again to me with the return.

47
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:46,448
I will have innovations.

48
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,574
With in 15 days!

49
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:50,048
Hello, headstock!

50
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:41,296
You do not have anything to make
in my bathroom.

51
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:45,737
You did not include/understand?

52
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,579
A fish???

53
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:52,896
A piranha?

54
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:57,533
In Paraguay,
I saw some devouring a cow.

55
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:39,810
Poor Schwartz died...

56
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:44,055
one day terrible and beautiful.

57
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:46,530
Harry, the tool of the massacre.

58
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:49,374
Who unchained
its wild appetite?

59
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:52,015
Such is the question.

60
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:56,492
Headsperson, hired killer,
service returns at low prices.

61
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:59,011
The Ethiopian cooker,

62
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:03,936
hammering joyeusement
the scrotum of the colonizer.

63
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:07,974
Limehouse, girl of the Raising Sun,

64
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:12,015
kamikaze of the cunnilingus.

65
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:14,015
Paul,

66
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:16,495
father founder, husband,

67
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:18,170
torturer...

68
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:21,571
and lover, ready with all the engagements,

69
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:23,776
everywhere, always,

70
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:25,976
choosing, comparing

71
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:29,849
one with the other...
Alice...

72
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,374
beauty queen,

73
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:33,172
phantom of passion,

74
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:35,893
vautrée in the lust.

75
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:41,858
Gwendolyn with the impetuous kidneys,

76
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:43,533
nave of cathedral...

77
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:48,493
And the intruder,
penetrating at Schwartz,

78
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:50,896
like Sparte in Athens,

79
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:54,177
y leaving devouring it tool of death.

80
00:16:56,180 --> 00:17:00,970
You know all.
But before the Court withdraws itself,

81
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:04,453
you must all examine.

82
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:32,460
I can help you, Miss?

83
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:33,530
Broken down?

84
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:35,852
Not, I keep the form.

85
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:38,170
I never saw you.

86
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:41,330
I have just arrived at Miranda.

87
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:44,048
Dancer? Stripper?

88
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:45,449
Interpret.

89
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:48,493
You go up?

90
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,534
It is not casher.

91
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:54,335
No importance.
I am the only cop of the corner.

92
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:58,376
Go up. You are already in form.

93
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:01,090
I need exercise.

94
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:02,815
Your name?

95
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:07,049
Margo Winchester. And yours?

96
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:09,455
Homer Johnson.

97
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,379
My word!

98
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:59,178
An appearance!

99
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:04,733
Be deaf for you or what?

100
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:11,051
OK, I repeat...

101
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:13,139
Where do you go?

102
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:14,415
Miranda.

103
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:34,656
Music?

104
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:37,018
As you will like it.

105
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:42,613
- You remainders with Miranda?
- Of passage.

106
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:45,176
I can make you change opinion.

107
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:50,258
Ca would astonish me.

108
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:07,612
- It is a short cut.
- I suspect it.

109
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:14,373
Bitch!

110
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:20,812
It was super!

111
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,214
It morflé...

112
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:22,293
It ceased suffering.

113
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:24,292
Regain the road!

114
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:26,814
Advance!

115
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:43,418
Why devil have killed it?

116
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:46,015
You had removed his combativeness to him

117
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:48,216
right before removing the life to him.

118
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:51,295
This karate is frightening.

119
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:54,572
What I see,

120
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:56,572
you can defend yourself.

121
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:58,930
Ca is not any doubt.

122
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:08,019
Go up in it.

123
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:11,210
Magne.

124
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:13,970
Get into the car!

125
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:25,649
It took on board you...

126
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,456
You had to cause it.

127
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:35,538
If I believe about it
my experiment of cop,

128
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:39,169
the girls create problems...

129
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:42,892
especially with half-naked.

130
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:55,253
In addition, an exception
is possible with Léonard Box,

131
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:58,615
it is the name of the type,

132
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:02,529
it was a foutor of shit.

133
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:08,131
Nobody will regret it,
except his/her father.

134
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:15,369
He hardly liked it,
but it belonged to him,

135
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:18,410
like the mill of Belcher' S Flat.

136
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:22,092
It is full with the aces.
It would give large

137
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:25,015
so that you stagnate in clink.

138
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:27,729
And then?

139
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:31,330
Let us see the things differently...

140
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:35,131
You avoided many paperworks
in the State.

141
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:42,819
It was to finish thus,
considering its control...

142
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:45,136
In the Kneader, with a large P.

143
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:52,736
You can arrange your weapon...

144
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:12,498
I did not attend the scene.
I was going to see Charlie Sumner

145
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:14,133
In Lucas Meadows.

146
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:20,056
This stubborn person refuses the telephone.

147
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:24,814
One did not see it in Miranda
since a lease,

148
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:27,098
it is perhaps sick.

149
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:30,093
I saw 2 people
to fight at the edge of the ravine,

150
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:32,572
just as I passed.

151
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:37,255
You fell both.

152
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:42,851
I believed you foutus.
A whore of fall!

153
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:44,931
To break the back.

154
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:47,740
I ran and I saw Box

155
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:50,414
spread out at the bottom of the ravine.

156
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:56,458
Then, hung to you with a root.

157
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:58,938
You have escaped it beautiful.

158
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:01,297
A cord... I went up you,

159
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:10,051
setting on the back seat.
You were hysterical.

160
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:14,652
Ca is included/understood.

161
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:18,220
I called the coroner Lou Dougal.

162
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:22,456
It had evil to recover the type.

163
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:25,857
Fortunately that it had two assistances.

164
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:30,537
It examined the body.

165
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:34,778
Cause death: broken back.

166
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:39,974
Reason: fall mortal.
I forgot anything?

167
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:41,979
Your commission.

168
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:43,659
One will speak about it at home.

169
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:06,971
You are a villain.
I saw it immediately.

170
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:09,131
What does one say on the desire?

171
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:11,336
With each one it his.

172
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:16,416
One will not continue thus!

173
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:18,055
Why not?

174
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:21,174
- tempo should be changed.
- Already inaccurate...

175
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:26,258
You will not know anything of it. And then...

176
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,372
I should not speak while sleeping.

177
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:33,328
You either, Homer.

178
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:38,091
You broke my glasses!

179
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:39,890
Afflicted,

180
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:42,578
I do not know my force.

181
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:47,250
A trick in plan was left.

182
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:03,050
Instead of the equality in front of the law,

183
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:05,939
Margo finds the equality under Homer.

184
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:09,497
The nest of the vulture where all is played.

185
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:12,857
The most macabre murder
ever made.

186
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:14,528
The Paul, most suspect,

187
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:17,578
inspired by 3 Muses,

188
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:19,970
jealousy, avarice and ambition.

189
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:23,139
Margo, machine with pleasure

190
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:27,654
that any man dreams to impale.

191
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:33,379
Headsperson,
white pink of death,

192
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:36,134
provider of pain.

193
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:37,859
The Ethiopian One,

194
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:40,409
hurricane of passion and trick.

195
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:42,335
Limehouse,

196
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:46,129
disconcerting
like a speech of Mao,

197
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:48,811
its body: a gold zither.

198
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:53,855
Alice, girl, lesbian,

199
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:58,491
protective princess of the sanctuary.

200
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:00,056
Gwendolyn,

201
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:04,255
have fornication, pseudo-husband.

202
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,013
Soft Alice...

203
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:10,093
Homer,
threatened by the axe and the cord,

204
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:11,295
in its dreams,

205
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:16,853
the gleam crimson saw,
heard the voice. was crucifié.

206
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:18,570
Leonard Box,

207
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:22,689
victim of its lust.
Dead end in truth

208
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:24,896
if he is the killer of the Nazi.

209
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:28,771
One of these creatures made

210
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:31,375
a horrible crime. Who?

211
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:39,448
Mister?

212
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:41,810
A sandwich with tuna and chips!

213
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:50,250
Of nothing, Ken.

214
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:17,571
Homer will fill
its monthly quota...

215
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:21,576
Then, that comes?

216
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:23,608
It is ready, treasure.

217
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:32,778
Bring back your bottom here...

218
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:50,248
Touch my centres...

219
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:54,209
Attempt at corruption?

220
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:57,129
- What do you look at?
- I admire.

221
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:00,615
I suck well...

222
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:07,535
I badly was never sucked.

223
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:16,939
This will rectify it.

224
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:05,973
Homer is made lubricate
early.

225
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:19,014
Look at the head of the chick!

226
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:17,252
Less than 30 seconds...

227
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:20,333
It was a warning.

228
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:21,569
Slip by, salts bitchy girl!

229
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:23,014
Bar yourself before...

230
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:26,491
that I remember
that I am the Law and the Order.

231
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:31,574
The warning...

232
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:51,056
Shit!
What does it believe, this whore?

233
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:18,457
Thus say, Homer,

234
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:24,338
what does it occur here?

235
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:27,774
Two murders! Bones of Adolf

236
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:30,898
scoured by a quite fatty fish!

237
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:34,768
Box broken into two!

238
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:38,292
With the girl, it acts of an accident.

239
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:42,529
I want the facts, Homer.
This which been able history.

240
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:44,419
Rafe, as usual?

241
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:46,895
With French bread.

242
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:49,739
I do not believe in it.

243
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:55,648
Darling, of the ration of oats for Rafe.
With the job!

244
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:57,209
Négrière!

245
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:04,698
It was said to me that the girl of the accident
was superb,

246
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:06,652
with an impressing name.

247
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:09,249
That is said?

248
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:10,779
Why not?

249
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:14,777
I do not have anything of to better do...

250
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:27,376
Speak to me
of this Margo Winchester.

251
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:35,136
I like the large milks,
but it converted me.

252
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:40,010
She has a époustouflant bottom.

253
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:42,813
You will not gourez.

254
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:46,888
Its milks are enormous.
With nipples

255
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:48,812
as large as of the centres.

256
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:54,096
But this bottom! Last night,
it sucked me with knees,

257
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:59,299
it returned nut to me!

258
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:01,610
Would have you need for assistance...

259
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:03,009
And how!

260
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:04,249
Saw you the panel?

261
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:08,974
ONE ENGAGES

262
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:11,131
It has been there for 15 days.
Nobody.

263
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:17,298
I know somebody...

264
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:19,093
I see you coming...

265
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:22,412
You refuse
what your Jules sees this vamp?

266
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:26,417
After me, it has right to the remainders.

267
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:29,450
One is made a remainder?

268
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:31,539
The job initially.

269
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:34,891
I will reserve to you
one moment this afternoon.

270
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:46,172
Not so quickly!

271
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:48,611
The stones hurt me!

272
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:50,412
There are not time.

273
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:54,810
A step beyond
abyssals zone of the extase.

274
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:59,611
The face of Teuton
is it binding to the lovers?

275
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:03,253
The mystery it is buried

276
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:08,258
or it is shamelessly
in front of our eyes...?

277
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,491
A vicious, but real murder.

278
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:17,494
Return quickly!

279
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:23,369
Ham sandwich,

280
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:26,811
fried, salad, 2 sandwiches hot!

281
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:33,053
Let us dispatch!

282
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:37,370
I bet that they are
like honey drops.

283
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:00,935
From which come do all these people?

284
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:02,776
I pigé.

285
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:06,736
Appointment after the job.

286
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:21,694
A double Chile-mustard
without onion.

287
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:23,168
It left.

288
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:25,178
Chile without onion.

289
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:27,251
I know. Double Chile,

290
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:30,293
much mustard,
no the onion.

291
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:32,009
I was right.

292
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:34,057
You attract the customers.

293
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:36,216
It is my personality...

294
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:41,898
Then! This hot dog?

295
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:50,971
I have shame to pay it if little.
The tip must compensate.

296
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:54,777
What a bottom!

297
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:57,539
Ouais, not badly.

298
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:01,655
One is succeeding,
treasure,

299
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:04,449
to really succeed.

300
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:22,090
Darling,

301
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:25,855
the purchases should be doubled
sausages and of bread.

302
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:28,255
Another thing, darling?

303
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:33,575
Avoid raising weight.

304
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:58,655
Thank you for your assistance, Margo.

305
00:43:58,860 --> 00:44:00,213
Ca occupies me.

306
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:01,775
Homer is taken.

307
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:07,939
Ca says to you to go in Garberville
to make races?

308
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:10,335
I want to go to swim

309
00:44:10,540 --> 00:44:12,895
In Salmon Creek,
close from Homer.

310
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:14,694
Deep splits,

311
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:17,534
superb surroundings... I go there.

312
00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:20,049
I would like to attach you...

313
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:21,852
Good joke!

314
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:24,613
Will make your purchases.

315
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:09,892
How is water?

316
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:14,136
Useless to press itself,
there are all our time.

317
00:47:05,580 --> 00:47:07,013
Hurry, décampe!

318
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:11,496
In the reserve, Pocahontas!

319
00:47:31,660 --> 00:47:34,811
It is red!
Kissed you with a squaw!

320
00:47:40,340 --> 00:47:42,296
The murder claims revenge.

321
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:44,974
The murderer rôde among us.

322
00:47:45,220 --> 00:47:46,494
It will be betrayed

323
00:47:46,740 --> 00:47:48,571
by its glance, its emotion?

324
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:52,452
Its efforts
to choke its culpability?

325
00:47:53,340 --> 00:47:56,491
Paul, with the émacié face,

326
00:47:56,740 --> 00:47:57,855
with the various dashes,

327
00:47:58,700 --> 00:48:03,012
leave its mark
on the belly of its prey,

328
00:48:03,260 --> 00:48:06,172
alleviating only its devouring thirst.

329
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:10,609
_ its eye himself embuent in front of the gold

330
00:48:10,820 --> 00:48:13,857
piled up by the new barbarians.

331
00:48:17,540 --> 00:48:22,978
Margo,
soft myrrh with the pointed centres.

332
00:48:23,180 --> 00:48:25,136
Why is it there? Plundering

333
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:27,211
and draining the men.

334
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:31,655
Lust and the desire
mixed in a figure

335
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:33,572
of Superwoman.

336
00:48:34,220 --> 00:48:36,336
Alice, diligent wife,

337
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:41,451
sharing the daily problems
with its Master,

338
00:48:41,740 --> 00:48:43,696
faithful... even if

339
00:48:43,940 --> 00:48:46,374
its variations lesbians

340
00:48:46,620 --> 00:48:48,815
profane the marital extase,

341
00:48:50,380 --> 00:48:54,692
the palate of the gourmet excites.

342
00:48:55,860 --> 00:49:00,376
Angel... or demon?

343
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:02,055
Alas! A whore!

344
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:07,773
Homer, ex-champion of the law,
has a devouring appetite

345
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:10,011
for sexual excesses.

346
00:49:10,260 --> 00:49:11,852
A bull

347
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:15,534
who takes part in the decathlon...

348
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:19,455
10 tests
pornographic figures.

349
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:23,772
Gwendolyn, black horse
in the race with the murder.

350
00:49:24,860 --> 00:49:27,215
The duet became a double duet.

351
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:30,612
The quartet became a trio.

352
00:49:30,860 --> 00:49:33,613
It is not between Paul and Alice,

353
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:37,053
but with them,
each one being conscious

354
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:39,052
relations of the other.

355
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:41,894
Inaccurate Gwendolyn has it...

356
00:49:42,140 --> 00:49:43,858
opened the Pandora's box,

357
00:49:44,340 --> 00:49:47,650
releasing the manes
of Desdémone and Othello?

358
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:50,209
Here is the difficulty.

359
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:55,615
Let us see the observers. Their innocence
does it hiding place the evil?

360
00:49:56,580 --> 00:49:59,890
Rafe, a ram

361
00:50:00,140 --> 00:50:01,812
drawn up like Gibraltar.

362
00:50:02,060 --> 00:50:03,732
The Ethiopian cooker,

363
00:50:04,020 --> 00:50:07,410
the black sheep does not carry out
always the herd.

364
00:50:07,660 --> 00:50:10,174
The Young Mamelue Thing,

365
00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:15,211
pulverizing the seed
Gendarmerie.

366
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:19,730
Léonard Box...
deaths are dumb.

367
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:23,094
Limehouse,
it tightens its satin skin.

368
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:26,898
1/2 H later,
would it kill again?

369
00:50:28,180 --> 00:50:30,330
Headsperson, the gloutonne,

370
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:34,459
able to milk the flow of the life.

371
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:38,170
The only language
included/understood by the savage,

372
00:50:38,420 --> 00:50:39,569
it is the fire of the gun.

373
00:50:43,020 --> 00:50:46,092
You all studied them.

374
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:47,928
But which?

375
00:50:48,180 --> 00:50:51,889
When illegitimate couples
link themselves,

376
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:55,931
the face of dying Teuton
impose yourself it

377
00:50:56,180 --> 00:50:58,136
with the lover without law,

378
00:50:58,380 --> 00:51:01,178
and the memory of the crime to the extase?

379
00:51:06,060 --> 00:51:07,459
Higher, Fred.

380
00:51:11,660 --> 00:51:13,491
Like that?

381
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:16,648
Hang it.

382
00:51:23,940 --> 00:51:25,168
It is the great evening!

383
00:51:25,420 --> 00:51:28,378
You succeeded well,
you two....

384
00:51:28,620 --> 00:51:30,736
To open a new bar...

385
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:33,848
Motus! It is for Margo!

386
00:51:34,580 --> 00:51:37,140
It prepares for this evening,

387
00:51:37,340 --> 00:51:39,854
wait to see its behaviour!

388
00:51:41,740 --> 00:51:43,731
I will miss the spectacle,

389
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:47,331
I must go to Eureka
this afternoon...

390
00:51:47,620 --> 00:51:50,259
Box, that which violated Margo,

391
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:52,809
would have known Adolf Schwartz.

392
00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:58,099
One never knows...

393
00:53:16,620 --> 00:53:19,054
To burst a tire one evening similar!

394
00:53:20,020 --> 00:53:21,248
Where is Alice?

395
00:53:21,620 --> 00:53:23,611
Part to get dressed...

396
00:53:23,820 --> 00:53:26,209
Will seek others of them.
On the rack.

397
00:53:30,020 --> 00:53:32,693
My uncle broke a leg.

398
00:53:33,020 --> 00:53:34,055
Motor bikes of shit!

399
00:53:37,460 --> 00:53:38,779
What a foot, this evening!

400
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:41,453
Beer is missed.

401
00:53:49,860 --> 00:53:51,771
Everyone is burst!

402
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:53,248
George, the beer!

403
00:54:02,060 --> 00:54:03,857
Is Rafe, where thus your axe?

404
00:54:08,140 --> 00:54:08,936
Give him.

405
00:54:20,180 --> 00:54:21,135
Beer!

406
00:54:22,340 --> 00:54:23,329
What a weak!

407
00:54:58,580 --> 00:54:59,649
With hair! With hair!

408
00:55:03,580 --> 00:55:05,252
Thank you, the guy,

409
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:07,019
for this ovation.

410
00:55:09,380 --> 00:55:11,894
The speeches, it is not my style.

411
00:55:12,140 --> 00:55:13,050
Aim its tits!

412
00:55:13,340 --> 00:55:14,170
The juke-box...

413
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:40,449
Send the other!

414
00:56:59,420 --> 00:57:00,330
Two for Rafe.

415
00:57:34,060 --> 00:57:34,776
Cool, Raoul...

416
00:57:37,340 --> 00:57:39,615
Rafe wants a recall.

417
00:58:04,020 --> 00:58:05,533
Call Smokey!

418
00:58:08,220 --> 00:58:10,893
Homer...
It is the only one with being able to calm

419
00:58:11,140 --> 00:58:12,778
this soak of Rafe.

420
00:58:13,020 --> 00:58:16,979
Let us go, it takes good time.

421
00:58:19,460 --> 00:58:21,815
Slip by to telephone!

422
00:58:22,580 --> 00:58:24,935
I will try to contain it.

423
00:58:25,140 --> 00:58:28,496
I hate this secrete way.

424
00:58:59,660 --> 00:59:00,490
Not touches!

425
00:59:03,900 --> 00:59:05,413
Remove your hands from there!

426
00:59:07,820 --> 00:59:09,253
Does not touch it, Rafe!

427
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:30,694
What do you make?

428
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:33,338
Release me!

429
00:59:47,100 --> 00:59:50,490
Known as In Homer Johnson
to come illico!

430
01:00:08,060 --> 01:00:09,698
Poor jerk!

431
01:00:40,340 --> 01:00:41,170
Go ahead, Rafe!

432
01:00:56,660 --> 01:00:58,139
Here is Cavalry!

433
01:00:59,620 --> 01:01:00,370
We draw!

434
01:01:27,260 --> 01:01:31,173
Withdraw your whore of tail!
The Help |!

435
01:01:47,260 --> 01:01:49,137
Release me!

436
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:02,495
Child of bastard!

437
01:02:27,820 --> 01:02:28,570
The axe!

438
01:02:47,220 --> 01:02:49,051
Do not cry any more. It is finished.

439
01:03:39,180 --> 01:03:42,172
Dumb! You wounded Paul.

440
01:05:18,380 --> 01:05:20,132
Rosebud!

441
01:05:20,380 --> 01:05:22,018
It is best.

442
01:06:25,260 --> 01:06:29,412
Meeting again
and treasons continue,

443
01:06:29,620 --> 01:06:33,454
the actors enlisent themselves in the extase,

444
01:06:34,100 --> 01:06:37,695
taken in a hurricane
of fire and passion.

445
01:06:38,500 --> 01:06:40,536
Where ground the killer?

446
01:06:40,740 --> 01:06:44,858
Unsuspected, anxious and dissimulated.

447
01:06:45,060 --> 01:06:48,257
Gather the indices,
there will not be more.

448
01:07:24,460 --> 01:07:26,894
Heard. I hang up again.

449
01:09:25,020 --> 01:09:27,818
Yes, me. Soft the small Alice!

450
01:09:28,060 --> 01:09:29,334
The least suspect!

451
01:09:29,580 --> 01:09:30,854
You are cop,

452
01:09:31,140 --> 01:09:35,418
you are not a waitress...
It was obvious. you and Homer...

453
01:09:35,940 --> 01:09:39,615
Error, loophole!
Our relation is fortuitous.

454
01:09:39,900 --> 01:09:43,097
I have evil to believe it.

455
01:09:45,420 --> 01:09:48,059
Your death will not be fortuitous!

456
01:09:51,980 --> 01:09:53,891
Why you? Your mobile?

457
01:09:54,140 --> 01:09:56,734
I will be the best!

458
01:09:57,380 --> 01:10:00,895
You and your muscular bottom!

459
01:10:01,140 --> 01:10:04,257
With what it will be used to you
in this combat with death?

460
01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:07,253
When did I reveal my identity?

461
01:10:07,660 --> 01:10:09,491
Your identity? Ah!

462
01:10:10,260 --> 01:10:11,932
You are only one whore!

463
01:10:13,140 --> 01:10:15,335
Then why to attack me?

464
01:10:16,660 --> 01:10:18,378
What do you believe?

465
01:10:18,620 --> 01:10:21,373
To have violated...

466
01:10:21,620 --> 01:10:23,372
raped my Paul!

467
01:10:23,620 --> 01:10:25,178
To have tripoté your guy?

468
01:10:25,780 --> 01:10:28,294
A weakling
and a poor fucker!

469
01:10:28,540 --> 01:10:31,100
Perhaps.

470
01:10:31,340 --> 01:10:34,571
Paul has innocence
and the stupidity of a child.

471
01:10:34,820 --> 01:10:37,050
He deserves forgiveness.

472
01:10:37,300 --> 01:10:39,894
As for its sexual value,

473
01:10:40,140 --> 01:10:43,291
28 cm, it are not to scorn.
Last night

474
01:10:43,540 --> 01:10:46,577
in full orgasm,

475
01:10:46,980 --> 01:10:49,540
it murmured your name,

476
01:10:51,580 --> 01:10:54,811
whereas it was still hidden

477
01:10:55,060 --> 01:10:57,858
in the splendour of my body.

478
01:11:00,740 --> 01:11:04,289
Who is a true woman?

479
01:11:05,940 --> 01:11:06,816
Pretty centres!

480
01:11:11,860 --> 01:11:14,499
Well drawn Pelvis! But Paul

481
01:11:15,820 --> 01:11:19,699
is a victim of the flesh,
a man what!

482
01:11:20,140 --> 01:11:21,334
Here it is!

483
01:11:22,580 --> 01:11:23,649
Retain that well,

484
01:11:24,140 --> 01:11:27,689
nobody will play
with the feelings of Paul.

485
01:11:28,180 --> 01:11:29,659
I always protected it,

486
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:34,094
even against this fag of Adolf.

487
01:11:34,300 --> 01:11:39,420
Which importance
if it were made put by Schwartz?

488
01:11:40,100 --> 01:11:41,613
It was my father.

489
01:11:41,860 --> 01:11:45,773
Then your maiden name
is Schwartz?

490
01:11:46,060 --> 01:11:47,379
My bottom!

491
01:11:48,340 --> 01:11:50,092
My true name
is Eva Braun Jr,

492
01:11:50,340 --> 01:11:52,854
bastard girl of Adolf Hitler

493
01:11:53,100 --> 01:11:55,250
and of its mistress fair oakum.

494
01:11:59,660 --> 01:12:03,289
But corpses
found in the Bunker?

495
01:12:03,540 --> 01:12:08,455
My mother sacrificed herself,
she aged,

496
01:12:08,660 --> 01:12:11,493
dad preferred the jeunettes...

497
01:12:11,700 --> 01:12:14,498
Both
worried for me...

498
01:12:17,380 --> 01:12:18,893
I waste my time.

499
01:12:19,140 --> 01:12:20,459
Where is this dagger?

500
01:12:20,700 --> 01:12:23,419
But the holocaust...
the hooligans Nazis

501
01:12:23,660 --> 01:12:25,855
fleeing the ship in perdition?

502
01:12:27,580 --> 01:12:29,013
The paddle of 3rd Reich?

503
01:12:29,860 --> 01:12:32,533
Wait one minute!

504
01:12:32,820 --> 01:12:35,653
The provided evidence
by the Russians?

505
01:12:35,900 --> 01:12:39,529
Concoctées twaddles
to like Stalin.

506
01:12:40,500 --> 01:12:44,015
Nobody likes to lose.
With the devil History!

507
01:12:44,420 --> 01:12:47,093
I killed my father
to save my marriage.

508
01:12:47,300 --> 01:12:49,530
- To save your marriage?
- Exact.

509
01:12:49,860 --> 01:12:51,896
Dad and me, one did not get along.

510
01:12:52,340 --> 01:12:55,650
It had been put to the boys
and 28 cm of Paul...

511
01:12:55,900 --> 01:12:57,697
I was tolerant.

512
01:12:58,260 --> 01:13:02,651
But the night, it did not ensure any more.
Exhausted by these meetings.

513
01:13:02,900 --> 01:13:04,697
It kissed for corn,

514
01:13:05,060 --> 01:13:07,733
this rotted corn
that my father extorted

515
01:13:08,460 --> 01:13:10,052
with poor guy.

516
01:13:10,300 --> 01:13:12,336
This corn which it gave to Paul

517
01:13:12,580 --> 01:13:15,890
to be made glitter

518
01:13:16,140 --> 01:13:19,018
by humiliating its virility.

519
01:13:19,260 --> 01:13:21,899
Its money financed the bar,

520
01:13:22,100 --> 01:13:25,934
not alleged success
"Coffee of Alice".

521
01:13:26,180 --> 01:13:29,013
This male chauvinist pig deserved to burst.

522
01:13:29,220 --> 01:13:32,417
All is recut.
This business is complex.

523
01:13:33,020 --> 01:13:36,137
The secrecy of Eva Braun Jr
will die with you,

524
01:13:36,380 --> 01:13:37,972
woodcock!
- Is wary,

525
01:13:38,220 --> 01:13:39,699
hedgehopping!
- Bitch!

526
01:13:41,340 --> 01:13:44,491
You have appointment
with eternity,

527
01:13:44,700 --> 01:13:47,214
prepare
to undergo my revenge!

528
01:13:48,460 --> 01:13:51,816
Murder and revenge combine
with the obscenity of Adolph.

529
01:13:53,220 --> 01:13:55,575
The law requires an equitable lawsuit

530
01:13:55,820 --> 01:13:58,539
and me, I will make you put at knees.

531
01:13:58,740 --> 01:14:00,492
Balivernes!

532
01:14:11,500 --> 01:14:16,893
I like that better.
It was a question of time.

533
01:14:23,980 --> 01:14:26,699
Rosebud... I will go until the end.

534
01:14:27,260 --> 01:14:28,978
One crescendo

535
01:14:29,220 --> 01:14:32,292
of removed from rim extravagance

536
01:14:32,500 --> 01:14:36,095
be a prelude to with the events to come.

537
01:14:38,780 --> 01:14:42,898
A camionneuse friend,
expert in godemichés,

538
01:14:43,100 --> 01:14:45,056
brought back for me of Frisco 2 tricks

539
01:14:45,300 --> 01:14:47,939
that I die of desire for testing.

540
01:14:48,500 --> 01:14:51,890
According to it, they offer
"the best of the 2 worlds",

541
01:14:52,100 --> 01:14:54,739
if you see what it wants to say.

542
01:14:55,220 --> 01:14:57,859
Here a bed in charge of history.

543
01:14:58,060 --> 01:15:00,654
It belonged to a girl
named Vixen.

544
01:15:08,380 --> 01:15:10,371
Paul, why?

545
01:15:11,020 --> 01:15:13,614
You killed Mr. Schwartz!

546
01:15:15,740 --> 01:15:19,050
Poor Adolf...
if misunderstood, condemned

547
01:15:19,460 --> 01:15:23,419
to have wanted to save the world...

548
01:15:25,380 --> 01:15:26,813
You hurt me, Paul!

549
01:15:29,980 --> 01:15:31,095
The ideal wife.

550
01:15:32,220 --> 01:15:34,495
My needs, its requirements.

551
01:15:34,780 --> 01:15:35,849
Soft Alice,

552
01:15:37,980 --> 01:15:40,653
if pretty... if egoïist.

553
01:15:43,980 --> 01:15:46,813
Always after my prick,
but for it only.

554
01:15:47,340 --> 01:15:48,295
Punish it, Paul.

555
01:15:51,980 --> 01:15:53,379
You resemble to him.

556
01:15:54,340 --> 01:15:55,489
A simple whore.

557
01:15:56,820 --> 01:15:57,889
A egoïist

558
01:15:59,020 --> 01:16:02,649
who wishes my body of sylphid
for it only.

559
01:16:05,380 --> 01:16:06,859
You also, you must perish.

560
01:16:14,860 --> 01:16:15,929
You hurt him!

561
01:16:16,180 --> 01:16:18,899
Do not move or parks with your bottom.

562
01:16:19,740 --> 01:16:22,129
Only one gesture and bye bye!

563
01:16:22,380 --> 01:16:24,018
I love you and I hate you!

564
01:16:24,620 --> 01:16:26,611
Be reasonable... The Company

565
01:16:26,860 --> 01:16:28,452
you will save.

566
01:16:28,660 --> 01:16:31,174
You with your large centres
and your large bottom!

567
01:16:35,660 --> 01:16:37,412
Sergeant,

568
01:16:37,700 --> 01:16:39,691
your direction of the duty,

569
01:16:39,940 --> 01:16:41,931
your contempt of the danger,

570
01:16:42,220 --> 01:16:45,132
deserve my admiration
and my gratitude.

571
01:16:45,420 --> 01:16:46,455
It was with joy.

572
01:16:47,580 --> 01:16:49,013
Can I tighten you the hand?

573
01:16:51,740 --> 01:16:56,052
Alas, your mission is ungrateful

574
01:16:56,300 --> 01:16:58,734
and infinite. I ask you

575
01:16:58,980 --> 01:17:01,574
of replonger in the brawl

576
01:17:02,540 --> 01:17:05,850
and to destroy
another kind of vermin

577
01:17:06,620 --> 01:17:10,613
who pollutes our people.
These naïives hearts

578
01:17:10,860 --> 01:17:13,613
of which the force
resist less than ours.

579
01:17:14,180 --> 01:17:16,250
I know that your prowesses,

580
01:17:16,660 --> 01:17:18,218
your direction of the duty,

581
01:17:20,260 --> 01:17:23,775
your pride to be useful
you will be useful.

582
01:17:23,980 --> 01:17:25,333
God blesses you...

583
01:17:27,860 --> 01:17:28,656
and keeps you.

584
01:17:29,860 --> 01:17:31,930
Another thing, chief?

585
01:17:36,460 --> 01:17:38,451
With The De luxe hotel Bar With 8h15,

586
01:17:40,420 --> 01:17:41,535
precise.

587
01:17:43,860 --> 01:17:46,772
The fly took the spider.

588
01:17:47,300 --> 01:17:50,451
I will reveal you
intimacy and sensuality

589
01:17:50,700 --> 01:17:51,735
merry.

590
01:17:53,900 --> 01:17:55,777
You came by far.

591
01:18:00,700 --> 01:18:05,296
Think of those
that my accounts effleurés.

592
01:18:07,140 --> 01:18:10,052
Rafe, the coléreux giant,

593
01:18:10,780 --> 01:18:13,578
victim of the silly thing and alcohol.

594
01:18:13,820 --> 01:18:15,173
Homer Johnson,

595
01:18:16,220 --> 01:18:17,858
the man behind the badge,

596
01:18:19,980 --> 01:18:21,732
obliging but unsubdued.

597
01:18:22,340 --> 01:18:24,808
Its emblem shines again.

598
01:18:28,380 --> 01:18:30,894
Soft small Alice...

599
01:18:31,380 --> 01:18:34,417
... in other words Eva Braun Jr...

600
01:18:35,940 --> 01:18:39,171
It is good...
Kindness does not have anything to see in it.

601
01:18:40,060 --> 01:18:41,857
The which gallops filly

602
01:18:42,220 --> 01:18:44,529
and left, very wet.

603
01:18:46,900 --> 01:18:48,333
Paul Reynart,

604
01:18:48,540 --> 01:18:50,292
how it is good!

605
01:18:51,700 --> 01:18:56,979
A fox running after its tail.
That it is done

606
01:19:01,620 --> 01:19:03,178
Margo Winchester!

607
01:19:03,420 --> 01:19:07,049
No too high summits,
too broad rivers

608
01:19:07,260 --> 01:19:10,775
of too hard furrow with biner!

609
01:19:11,580 --> 01:19:12,456
I enjoyed!

610
01:19:14,260 --> 01:19:17,457
Winchester... über Alles!

611
01:19:36,580 --> 01:19:39,811
Moron! I had defended you
to give this disc.

612
01:19:40,020 --> 01:19:41,692
In your orders, Martin!
