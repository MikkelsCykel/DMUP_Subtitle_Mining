00:02:37,133 --> 00:02:40,125
Being a policeman
is not what you see on TV.

2
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:43,405
l've never had to pick between
the red and blue wires.

3
00:02:43,613 --> 00:02:48,562
Never seen a police car flip and cause
other cars to burst into flames.

4
00:02:48,773 --> 00:02:53,642
Never had to jump across rooftops.
l investigate crimes, track leads. . .

5
00:02:53,853 --> 00:02:59,371
. . .and sit in court. lt's difficult,
tedious work, and you won't get rich.

6
00:02:59,533 --> 00:03:02,366
But l've done it for 28 years.

7
00:03:02,573 --> 00:03:06,805
l'm a detective. That's what l do.
lf you break the law. . .

8
00:03:07,013 --> 00:03:10,926
. . .l'll do all l can to hunt you down
and put you behind bars.

9
00:03:12,493 --> 00:03:15,166
l won't say that l succeed every time.

10
00:03:15,373 --> 00:03:19,366
But l try to make sure that
if you do the crime, you'll do time.

11
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:20,966
Any questions?

12
00:03:25,533 --> 00:03:29,651
Well, Detective Preston,
why don't you tell us about. . .

13
00:03:29,853 --> 00:03:32,162
. . .the lighter side of police work?

14
00:03:33,133 --> 00:03:35,363
You know. The fun days.

15
00:03:37,173 --> 00:03:40,290
l chased him over three roofs.
You can't do this!

16
00:03:40,493 --> 00:03:43,246
lt's from the mayor.
You're a loose cannon.

17
00:03:43,453 --> 00:03:46,206
-You destroyed a city block!
-He fired first.

18
00:03:46,413 --> 00:03:47,687
l should read him his rights?

19
00:03:47,893 --> 00:03:53,968
-You should've called for backup.
-My only backup is in a hospital bed!

20
00:03:57,333 --> 00:04:01,963
His doctor called five minutes ago.
Jimmy didn't make it.

21
00:04:03,413 --> 00:04:04,402
Oh, God.

22
00:04:09,933 --> 00:04:11,525
Oh, God, no.

23
00:04:12,493 --> 00:04:14,085
No!

24
00:04:15,573 --> 00:04:18,485
-He was talking about getting out.
-lt's hard.

25
00:04:18,733 --> 00:04:21,930
He was like a brother to me, captain.

26
00:04:22,093 --> 00:04:25,768
Since we was kids, we was partners.
We used to hang out. . .

27
00:04:25,973 --> 00:04:29,409
. . .and dream about
being on the force together.

28
00:04:29,613 --> 00:04:32,650
That was the dream.
Just two little lrish boys. . .

29
00:04:32,853 --> 00:04:36,607
. . .fighting, scrapping,
thinking about making a difference.

30
00:04:36,813 --> 00:04:38,769
God, l'm gonna miss him!

31
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:44,690
l'll need your gun
and your shield, Pete.

32
00:04:51,573 --> 00:04:55,202
l may be off the force,
but l am not off this case!

33
00:04:55,773 --> 00:05:00,244
-That's not in the script.
-l just threw that in at the end.

34
00:05:00,453 --> 00:05:04,492
-l thought l should get the last line.
-Nailed it!

35
00:05:05,613 --> 00:05:08,002
Trey, it was great. Very believable.

36
00:05:08,213 --> 00:05:11,649
-But l'm not married to it.
-You can't fix perfect.

37
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:13,445
We have imaginations.

38
00:05:13,773 --> 00:05:15,445
Thanks. We'll call you.

39
00:05:15,653 --> 00:05:17,883
-You got my number.
-Right here.

40
00:05:18,093 --> 00:05:20,323
-Moved to tears. Bye-bye.
-Take care.

41
00:05:20,493 --> 00:05:22,449
-You too.
-Restroom on the left.

42
00:05:22,733 --> 00:05:26,009
-Don't give up the day job.
-Unless it's acting.

43
00:05:31,093 --> 00:05:33,448
1 L43, clear from code 7.

44
00:05:33,613 --> 00:05:37,128
Roger, 1 L43.
Hope you had a nice lunch.

45
00:06:28,453 --> 00:06:31,013
Getting ready to break my old score.

46
00:06:39,493 --> 00:06:41,370
Gonna break my old record!

47
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:48,803
Now l get my grades in kills.

48
00:06:52,653 --> 00:06:55,247
Just broke it!
l got the top 1 0 spots now!

49
00:06:55,413 --> 00:07:00,692
-Anybody want to take on the lce Trey?
-Way to lay down the law, Top Cop.

50
00:07:43,253 --> 00:07:45,642
-How you doing?
-What's up?

51
00:07:46,813 --> 00:07:52,604
-Mitchie Mitch! How's it going, man?
-This is a friend of mine. Rich guy.

52
00:07:52,813 --> 00:07:56,442
-How you doing?
-l'm all right.

53
00:08:03,053 --> 00:08:08,844
Requesting assistance, possible 21 1 at
the TV repair shop on 1 st and Santee.

54
00:08:09,613 --> 00:08:11,763
Maxis Network Channel 3 chopper.

55
00:08:11,973 --> 00:08:17,252
We got a hit on the police scanner.
Something going down at 1st and Santee.

56
00:08:18,973 --> 00:08:21,771
This is Maxis Mobile One.
We're on our way.

57
00:08:22,253 --> 00:08:24,926
A quick left, quick right.

58
00:08:26,133 --> 00:08:27,725
All day.

59
00:08:28,813 --> 00:08:32,852
-We got a couple of big spenders.
-Don't get up for us.

60
00:08:43,893 --> 00:08:46,248
You all want to do something?

61
00:08:46,413 --> 00:08:50,850
Yeah, we were wondering
if maybe you'd throw in a free set.

62
00:08:51,013 --> 00:08:53,811
Two free sets.
One for him, one for me.

63
00:08:59,893 --> 00:09:01,372
What's in the bag?

64
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:04,051
-Let's do it.
-All right.

65
00:09:27,053 --> 00:09:28,486
lt's all here.

66
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:30,285
-All good?
-Good to go.

67
00:09:30,613 --> 00:09:33,081
Good. So you show us yours.

68
00:09:36,173 --> 00:09:37,925
Don't look, now.

69
00:09:41,493 --> 00:09:42,482
Touchdown.

70
00:09:48,813 --> 00:09:52,852
-Check the metal detector's batteries.
-How about that, Re?

71
00:10:14,253 --> 00:10:15,368
Thirsty?

72
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:17,807
A lifesaver.

73
00:10:19,253 --> 00:10:22,370
That's some pretty high-quality shit.

74
00:10:22,573 --> 00:10:25,292
All right. So we're on, right?

75
00:10:31,373 --> 00:10:33,284
What the hell is this?

76
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:36,884
-What the hell is going on?
-Wait. Hold on.

77
00:10:37,093 --> 00:10:39,653
-This some police shit?
-What?

78
00:10:39,853 --> 00:10:44,768
-You brought the police back here?
-Take it easy!

79
00:10:44,973 --> 00:10:48,648
-Don't tell me to take it easy!
-Don't tell me to shut up.

80
00:10:48,813 --> 00:10:51,691
You better calm your punk ass down!

81
00:10:51,893 --> 00:10:54,088
Stop pointing that shit at me!

82
00:10:55,533 --> 00:10:58,206
-Put that away.
-You think it's a game?

83
00:11:00,173 --> 00:11:01,686
Put the gun away.

84
00:11:02,253 --> 00:11:05,484
See, it's gone.
lt's all over. Let's go. Come on.

85
00:11:10,613 --> 00:11:13,685
Let's wrap it up.
l don't want them coming back.

86
00:11:13,893 --> 00:11:15,042
All right.

87
00:11:17,973 --> 00:11:19,725
What the hell is going on?

88
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:25,485
-Shit, we on Channel 5!
-l'm gonna blast these fools!

89
00:11:52,053 --> 00:11:55,568
-What was that, a bazooka?
-You shot the wrong brother.

90
00:11:55,773 --> 00:11:59,891
-l'll find the guy with the cannon.
-Hands behind your back.

91
00:12:00,533 --> 00:12:04,731
l'm calling Johnnie Cochran.
l got his number. You're going down.

92
00:12:06,213 --> 00:12:07,487
Okay, showtime.

93
00:12:10,693 --> 00:12:11,842
Stop, police!

94
00:12:23,973 --> 00:12:26,567
Okay, round two, baby.

95
00:12:27,573 --> 00:12:30,133
-Freeze! L.A.P.D. !
-Undercover narcotics!

96
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:33,689
-Drop it!
-We got an officer-involved shooting!

97
00:12:33,893 --> 00:12:39,251
Put your weapon down, right now!
Right now! Down!

98
00:12:42,373 --> 00:12:44,045
Good job, officer!

99
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:57,566
-Smile for the camera, lce Trey.
-Get back here! You're under arrest!

100
00:13:00,453 --> 00:13:04,332
Turn that shit off!
Turn that shit off!

101
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:15,443
Out of my way! Police officer!

102
00:13:22,493 --> 00:13:23,482
Look out!

103
00:13:30,293 --> 00:13:32,090
Get that camera out of here!

104
00:13:39,533 --> 00:13:41,603
-Are you okay?
-lt went through my vest.

105
00:13:41,813 --> 00:13:44,691
-We need an R.A. unit. Get away!
-l'm staying.

106
00:13:44,893 --> 00:13:48,966
-Get the goddamn camera out of here.
-l'm just doing my job.

107
00:13:50,013 --> 00:13:51,526
What are you doing?

108
00:13:52,853 --> 00:13:54,445
Get a real job.

109
00:13:57,333 --> 00:14:00,928
Talk to us.
Give us some information, something.

110
00:14:03,853 --> 00:14:07,004
-Have a statement?
-Don't break the police tape.

111
00:14:07,253 --> 00:14:10,370
-We have a right--
-To keep on the other side.

112
00:14:10,573 --> 00:14:14,088
Aren't you the cop who got busted
with his own cuffs?

113
00:14:14,253 --> 00:14:16,767
Think an officer doing his job
is funny?

114
00:14:16,973 --> 00:14:21,046
Let's see how funny it is
when l move this tape back 20 feet.

115
00:14:21,253 --> 00:14:24,006
-He'll be a Bloopers classic.
-Get B-roll.

116
00:14:24,173 --> 00:14:28,963
Come over the tape, you'll get B-roll
of me kicking your ass down to Sunset.

117
00:14:29,293 --> 00:14:32,126
-Detective Preston!
-Detective Preston!

118
00:14:33,853 --> 00:14:38,722
-Why did you shoot the camera?
-Are you a loose cannon?

119
00:14:41,693 --> 00:14:42,842
What happened?

120
00:14:48,653 --> 00:14:50,723
-Give me all you got.
-Brad?

121
00:14:50,933 --> 00:14:52,332
Hi, Chase. Go.

122
00:14:52,493 --> 00:14:56,372
l have the show to pull your
network from the ratings toilet.

123
00:14:56,533 --> 00:14:59,730
-You can do public executions?
-Meet Mitch Preston.

124
00:15:01,293 --> 00:15:04,683
-You know l don't read.
-Look at the pictures. Annie.

125
00:15:04,893 --> 00:15:07,612
Get that f* * *ing thing out of here!

126
00:15:07,813 --> 00:15:08,928
What was that?

127
00:15:09,253 --> 00:15:12,211
''Detective Preston
destroys Maxis TV camera. ''

128
00:15:12,413 --> 00:15:15,291
-That's ours.
-''Rogue cop guns down camera. ''

129
00:15:15,493 --> 00:15:16,846
-We can sue.
-Exactly.

130
00:15:17,213 --> 00:15:21,252
He's Dirty Harry, he's real
and we've got him by the balls.

131
00:15:21,453 --> 00:15:25,048
l see where you're going with this.
A reality show.

132
00:15:25,413 --> 00:15:28,211
-How is it different than Cops?
-Did you see?

133
00:15:28,413 --> 00:15:30,244
He's a modern-day cowboy.

134
00:15:30,413 --> 00:15:34,486
He's sexy, volatile. He's a bad boy,
and women love bad boys.

135
00:15:34,693 --> 00:15:37,571
-He could frisk me.
-You like getting frisked?

136
00:15:37,933 --> 00:15:41,289
Brad, focus. Want to see it again
in slow motion?

137
00:15:41,453 --> 00:15:43,683
-l get the point. Shit!
-What?

138
00:15:43,853 --> 00:15:48,005
-l was outbid for an A-Team lunch box.
-Okay, Brad.

139
00:15:48,293 --> 00:15:53,287
-So we've got this Mitch Preston?
-We're with him 24 hours a day.

140
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:58,129
Because he's gonna blow again,
and when he does, we'll be there.

141
00:15:58,453 --> 00:16:01,126
lf he makes a lot of arrests,
he gets a prize?

142
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:03,688
-Who gets the prize?
-lt's not a game show.

143
00:16:03,853 --> 00:16:08,643
This is one man, on his own,
kicking ass and taking names.

144
00:16:10,853 --> 00:16:14,084
-Can we give him a partner?
-That's a good idea.

145
00:16:14,253 --> 00:16:19,043
-We'll give him a funny-minority type.
-That'll get the NAACP off my back.

146
00:16:19,253 --> 00:16:22,245
-Or is it the NCAA?
-Do we have a deal?

147
00:16:22,453 --> 00:16:24,728
-Fine, go make a pilot.
-No, Brad.

148
00:16:24,933 --> 00:16:27,891
This guy isn't a pilot, he's a series.

149
00:16:28,093 --> 00:16:31,210
Trust me.
l'll stake my entire reputation on it.

150
00:16:31,733 --> 00:16:37,046
What reputation? You still get shit
for faking the flammable pajama story.

151
00:16:37,253 --> 00:16:39,926
You can't tell me that wasn't good TV.

152
00:16:40,093 --> 00:16:44,564
Are you in or out? l'm pitching
this at Fox in half an hour.

153
00:16:44,853 --> 00:16:48,163
-l'll give a six-episode commitment.
-Yes!

154
00:16:48,373 --> 00:16:53,367
But if it's all pit stops at Krispy
Kreme, l'm pulling the plug. . .

155
00:16:53,573 --> 00:16:57,043
-. . .and you're out of a job.
-We'll all be out of a job.

156
00:16:57,253 --> 00:17:00,882
What do they teach you in China?
Let's go. Bring it on.

157
00:17:01,813 --> 00:17:03,929
-You rocked!
-We're screwed.

158
00:17:04,133 --> 00:17:08,172
-We know nothing about these shows.
-There are rules.

159
00:17:08,373 --> 00:17:12,048
Call L.A.P.D. and get clearances.
And find a cameraman.

160
00:17:12,253 --> 00:17:15,484
-ls Julio out of traction?
-l'll call the hospital.

161
00:17:15,693 --> 00:17:20,892
-What if our Dirty Harry says no?
-Everybody wants to be on TV.

162
00:17:27,493 --> 00:17:32,203
1 0-36. lt looks like the stolen cuffs
were an inside job.

163
00:17:32,413 --> 00:17:34,722
That's very funny, guys.

164
00:17:36,053 --> 00:17:38,009
Very funny. Very well-written.

165
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:47,370
What are you reading,
the Jenny Craig newsletter?

166
00:17:47,573 --> 00:17:51,407
FYl, my friend,
a lot of this is muscle.

167
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:55,248
lt's a flyer for some new
reality-TV cop show.

168
00:18:00,533 --> 00:18:05,448
-l got to be part of this.
-Thought you wanted to be a detective.

169
00:18:05,653 --> 00:18:08,451
l'm a cop
and l'm a professional actor.

170
00:18:08,653 --> 00:18:13,488
Your career consists of a few lines
on an episode of Diagnosis Murder.

171
00:18:13,933 --> 00:18:17,767
All l need is the right part
and l'll get my big break.

172
00:18:17,973 --> 00:18:21,852
Know how old Sam Jackson was
when he got his break? He was 42.

173
00:18:22,053 --> 00:18:26,410
Okay, but he's got, gosh,
what's that thing called? Talent.

174
00:18:26,613 --> 00:18:30,652
l'm talented. l ain't no Sam Jackson,
but l'm talented.

175
00:18:30,853 --> 00:18:35,085
Your partner will be Mitch Preston.
We know who'd wear the cuffs there.

176
00:18:35,373 --> 00:18:37,125
He nailed the other lead?

177
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:40,803
He's front-page news.
Everybody's talking about him.

178
00:18:41,013 --> 00:18:44,210
l'd blow his old ass off the screen
every night.

179
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:46,568
You crazy? Mitch Preston, please!

180
00:18:46,773 --> 00:18:50,083
l said, ''Do you wanna take your feet
off the desk?''

181
00:18:51,573 --> 00:18:54,485
Get your feet off the desk.
Where's Lazy Boy?

182
00:18:54,653 --> 00:18:58,123
My client's taking the Fifth.
He's the victim here.

183
00:18:59,213 --> 00:19:03,525
Got yourself a pricey lawyer.
Had to sell a lot of TVs for that.

184
00:19:03,693 --> 00:19:07,003
-Who's paying?
-That's privileged information.

185
00:19:07,213 --> 00:19:10,205
The captain needs to see you
when you're done.

186
00:19:10,373 --> 00:19:14,252
He's done. Come on, ReRun.
This interview is over.

187
00:19:14,413 --> 00:19:18,292
-We don't talk, we walk.
-For now.

188
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:24,849
-Do you want me to start filming?
-Yeah, everything you see. Perfect.

189
00:19:26,253 --> 00:19:27,527
Oh, my God.

190
00:19:27,973 --> 00:19:31,363
This place is so depressing.
lt looks like a tomb.

191
00:19:31,533 --> 00:19:33,330
Well, you wanted reality.

192
00:19:33,533 --> 00:19:36,605
We need a reality change.
This is hideous.

193
00:19:37,453 --> 00:19:42,083
l'm not doing it.
Let them follow somebody else.

194
00:19:42,293 --> 00:19:45,922
They don't want anyone else.
You the man of the hour.

195
00:19:46,133 --> 00:19:50,411
-All l did was shoot a video camera.
-You made us look like savages.

196
00:19:50,573 --> 00:19:53,565
-The network is suing for $ 1 0 million.
-What?

197
00:19:53,773 --> 00:19:57,322
They said you could have killed
their cameraman.

198
00:19:57,533 --> 00:19:59,649
Maybe l should have killed him.

199
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:05,361
The chief already cut the deal.
Do the show, and they drop the suit.

200
00:20:05,613 --> 00:20:08,491
What?
That's extortion! They can't do that.

201
00:20:08,693 --> 00:20:12,925
We need good PR.
Community relations are in the toilet.

202
00:20:13,133 --> 00:20:17,649
-You the best detective we got.
-So, what about this big gun?

203
00:20:17,813 --> 00:20:22,603
Am l supposed to let them follow me
around while l track down the weapon?

204
00:20:22,893 --> 00:20:27,091
-Look, l did an episode of Cops once.
-You did an episode of Cops?

205
00:20:27,293 --> 00:20:30,171
You forget the camera is even there.

206
00:20:30,373 --> 00:20:35,242
-This is real work. l'm not an actor.
-No one is saying you can't work.

207
00:20:35,813 --> 00:20:40,807
But you screwed up. And now
you've got to play ball. End of story.

208
00:20:42,213 --> 00:20:46,684
You'll be reporting
to the show's producer, Chase Renzi.

209
00:20:46,893 --> 00:20:49,691
Chase Renzi? ls that a real name?

210
00:20:50,053 --> 00:20:53,762
l won't take orders from some
coked-out Hollywood dickhead.

211
00:20:53,933 --> 00:20:56,527
Not in a million years.
That l won't do.

212
00:20:56,773 --> 00:21:00,004
That's good,
because she doesn't have a dick.

213
00:21:01,253 --> 00:21:05,326
Check her out for yourself.
She's outside, waiting for you.

214
00:21:09,893 --> 00:21:12,248
Well. Better looking than l thought.

215
00:21:14,053 --> 00:21:19,411
We gotta bring in color, some light.
Do you think these windows move?

216
00:21:20,493 --> 00:21:22,290
Detective Preston, hi.

217
00:21:22,493 --> 00:21:25,451
l can see you're busy.
We'll talk tomorrow.

218
00:21:25,613 --> 00:21:27,365
He's not very friendly.

219
00:21:27,533 --> 00:21:30,730
Find out where he eats.
Make a reservation for two.

220
00:21:41,773 --> 00:21:44,651
-Here you go, cover boy.
-Thanks.

221
00:21:45,773 --> 00:21:49,732
Detective Preston, Chase Renzi.
lt's a pleasure to meet you.

222
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:53,403
-How you doing?
-Good. l see you've already ordered.

223
00:21:54,053 --> 00:21:57,409
-Make it quick, l have work to do.
-What can l get you?

224
00:21:57,653 --> 00:22:01,441
Same as him. A cheeseburger, rare,
fries and a Coke.

225
00:22:01,773 --> 00:22:03,604
-Diet?
-Regular.

226
00:22:06,213 --> 00:22:09,125
So, Detective Preston. . . .
Can l call you Mitch?

227
00:22:10,733 --> 00:22:14,203
Why don't l just launch
into a few basic questions. . .

228
00:22:14,413 --> 00:22:18,804
-. . .and find out what makes you tick.
-l don't tick.

229
00:22:19,413 --> 00:22:22,485
-Sure you do. Everybody ticks.
-Not me.

230
00:22:23,693 --> 00:22:27,049
Tell me about yourself.
You have a girlfriend, a wife?

231
00:22:27,253 --> 00:22:29,562
-Ex-wife.
-Ex-wife.

232
00:22:29,773 --> 00:22:31,889
Was it a painful divorce?

233
00:22:32,493 --> 00:22:36,691
l only ask because l was divorced,
and l know it can be difficult.

234
00:22:36,893 --> 00:22:38,531
l mean, did you drink?

235
00:22:38,733 --> 00:22:43,124
Lady, l'm here because my captain
made me. l had no choice.

236
00:22:43,293 --> 00:22:46,842
l have no interest in you,
your questions or your show.

237
00:22:47,133 --> 00:22:51,172
Not only do l understand
your resistance, l appreciate it.

238
00:22:51,533 --> 00:22:53,171
You do, huh? Good.

239
00:22:53,373 --> 00:22:58,572
l'm not into making the same bullshit
cop show we've seen a million times.

240
00:22:58,733 --> 00:23:03,204
That's why l believe if we're honest
and open with each other. . .

241
00:23:03,373 --> 00:23:06,206
. . .we could do something
very special here.

242
00:23:07,053 --> 00:23:09,613
l don't know
what you're talking about.

243
00:23:09,773 --> 00:23:13,243
-l'm talking about reality, Mitch.
-There you go.

244
00:23:13,573 --> 00:23:16,531
Letting the world find out
who you really are.

245
00:23:16,973 --> 00:23:21,125
You're looking for loose cannon,
cop-on-the-edge Serpico bullshit.

246
00:23:21,293 --> 00:23:24,126
l'm telling you,
you're wasting your time.

247
00:23:25,773 --> 00:23:27,764
See that anger, Mitch?

248
00:23:28,133 --> 00:23:30,169
lt's working for you.

249
00:23:30,373 --> 00:23:33,570
The audience will connect
with that in a major way.

250
00:23:33,853 --> 00:23:35,605
l'm out of here.

251
00:23:35,973 --> 00:23:39,249
l'll call you later
to discuss your new partner.

252
00:23:40,933 --> 00:23:43,208
Want that in a doggy bag?

253
00:23:44,653 --> 00:23:48,202
No.
Thanks, though. lt was delicious.

254
00:23:52,333 --> 00:23:56,008
-How did it go? ls he intense?
-l need cherry Tums, quick.

255
00:23:56,173 --> 00:24:00,530
-ls he psyched about the show?
-lt may be harder than l thought.

256
00:24:01,333 --> 00:24:03,608
-Hey!
-You son of a bitch!

257
00:24:08,813 --> 00:24:10,849
Freeze! L.A.P.D. !

258
00:24:19,213 --> 00:24:21,886
Wait! Wait!

259
00:24:37,253 --> 00:24:40,802
Bad idea. l only got two things
bigger than my mouth.

260
00:24:40,973 --> 00:24:43,407
One of them is pointed at your head.

261
00:24:45,253 --> 00:24:49,804
-You want to do this the hard way?
-l'll stick you, pig!

262
00:25:01,453 --> 00:25:05,128
-Okay, officer. You nice with yours.
-You damn right.

263
00:25:05,293 --> 00:25:10,242
lf your boys want to know who put the
smack down on you, my badge is 38723.

264
00:25:10,533 --> 00:25:14,003
l go by the name of Trey Sellars,
patrolman.

265
00:25:23,053 --> 00:25:28,081
-l believe this belongs to you, ma'am.
-Chase Renzi. That was incredible.

266
00:25:28,493 --> 00:25:32,532
Just doing my job, like the badge
says, protecting and serving.

267
00:25:32,733 --> 00:25:36,203
-Get this psycho off me!
-What's with the Superfly shit?

268
00:25:36,413 --> 00:25:39,769
-l got the situation in hand.
-Top Cop, how you doing?

269
00:25:39,973 --> 00:25:41,452
This is my collar.

270
00:25:41,613 --> 00:25:44,332
Never leave a suspect
who's not cuffed.

271
00:25:44,533 --> 00:25:47,206
-He could've had a gun.
-Nobody got no gun.

272
00:25:47,413 --> 00:25:51,247
Trey, l think you broke a rib.
Tell him to get the cuffs off.

273
00:25:51,533 --> 00:25:54,093
l told you l can't do handcuffs.

274
00:25:54,253 --> 00:25:57,006
Quiet!
You have the right to remain silent!

275
00:25:57,333 --> 00:25:59,244
-You know each other?
-No.

276
00:25:59,453 --> 00:26:02,286
Never seen him before.
Just another criminal.

277
00:26:02,493 --> 00:26:06,532
Bullshit. We took a stage combat class
together last fall.

278
00:26:06,733 --> 00:26:07,961
Nice try, pal.

279
00:26:08,173 --> 00:26:11,609
He's just trying to weasel
his way out of the crime.

280
00:26:11,813 --> 00:26:15,203
-That's what he's doing.
-He looks like a real menace.

281
00:26:15,413 --> 00:26:16,766
Who wants to explain?

282
00:26:16,973 --> 00:26:21,125
Trey said he'd give me $50 if l
snatched the lady's purse and ran.

283
00:26:21,293 --> 00:26:24,251
He'd pull up in his police car,
jump out. . .

284
00:26:24,453 --> 00:26:27,490
. . .chase me up a fence,
beat me down, kick me--

285
00:26:27,693 --> 00:26:29,524
All right, all right. Okay.

286
00:26:30,573 --> 00:26:33,371
l set the whole thing up.
lt was a big setup.

287
00:26:35,373 --> 00:26:38,410
l set it up to make it look
like l was. . . .

288
00:26:38,573 --> 00:26:42,088
-l was auditioning to get this part.
-What part?

289
00:26:42,253 --> 00:26:44,721
Your partner.
We've been interviewing.

290
00:26:44,933 --> 00:26:46,730
lt won't be this moron.

291
00:26:46,893 --> 00:26:49,612
l should report you
for impersonating a cop.

292
00:26:51,213 --> 00:26:55,206
Put a lock on that ''moron'' shit.
Why you take everything so seriously?

293
00:26:55,373 --> 00:26:58,251
You should be protecting,
not staging crimes.

294
00:26:58,413 --> 00:27:00,722
-Someone could've got hurt.
-Like me.

295
00:27:00,933 --> 00:27:04,050
l'm learning from a guy
who shot a news camera?

296
00:27:04,253 --> 00:27:08,087
You got the part already.
l'm just trying to spruce it up.

297
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:12,366
-That's what you normally do at work.
-Better watch your mouth.

298
00:27:12,573 --> 00:27:15,963
What are you gonna do,
wrap me up in caution tape?

299
00:27:17,213 --> 00:27:20,489
No, l ain't gonna wrap you up
in caution tape.

300
00:27:20,653 --> 00:27:26,330
But l'll tell you, punk, l might whip
your ass up and down the parking lot.

301
00:27:27,013 --> 00:27:30,642
Work on your Starsky and Hutch
routine on your own time.

302
00:27:30,853 --> 00:27:34,163
You better walk off.
l was getting ready to slap you.

303
00:27:34,373 --> 00:27:36,807
-He's a disgrace.
-You'd work with him?

304
00:27:36,973 --> 00:27:38,725
Never in a million years.

305
00:27:42,333 --> 00:27:45,882
-l think we have good chemistry.
-Riveting.

306
00:27:46,093 --> 00:27:48,448
-Amazing.
-Really?

307
00:27:49,773 --> 00:27:51,331
Thank you. All right.

308
00:27:51,653 --> 00:27:55,202
The guy's a joke.
There's no way l'll work with him.

309
00:27:55,413 --> 00:27:58,485
l don't want to hear it.
Shit, come on.

310
00:28:00,853 --> 00:28:01,842
Thanks.

311
00:28:03,773 --> 00:28:07,004
You're doing this. That's an order.

312
00:28:08,493 --> 00:28:10,961
Trapped in the jaws, he struggled.

313
00:28:12,293 --> 00:28:16,081
You'll never see no brothers
messing with no sharks.

314
00:28:16,253 --> 00:28:17,242
Never.

315
00:28:23,253 --> 00:28:24,242
Hello?

316
00:28:26,373 --> 00:28:29,490
l saw you on TV,
shooting up the neighborhood.

317
00:28:32,893 --> 00:28:36,488
What's going on, Vargas?
l was trying to call you, dog.

318
00:28:36,733 --> 00:28:37,722
Oh, yeah?

319
00:28:37,933 --> 00:28:41,403
l got cell phones, call waiting,
e-mail, voice mail. . .

320
00:28:41,613 --> 00:28:44,411
. . .and l haven't heard una chingada
from you.

321
00:28:44,613 --> 00:28:46,251
lt ain't like that, dog.

322
00:28:46,413 --> 00:28:50,042
l'm laying low till everything
dies down. lt got crazy.

323
00:28:50,253 --> 00:28:52,562
And did l say you could use my gun?

324
00:28:53,213 --> 00:28:55,886
You know, Lazy Boy, I trusted you.

325
00:28:56,413 --> 00:28:58,244
And you let me down.

326
00:28:58,413 --> 00:29:02,088
And now you put
my entire shipment at risk.

327
00:29:02,493 --> 00:29:05,246
You used that gun
without my permission.

328
00:29:07,853 --> 00:29:12,244
We don't want that getting
into the wrong hands, do we now?

329
00:29:14,533 --> 00:29:19,766
No, l was just borrowing it.
Just testing it out, you know?

330
00:29:21,293 --> 00:29:26,083
-And how did it work?
-Real good. l got it right here.

331
00:29:30,733 --> 00:29:32,246
So we cool, right?

332
00:29:35,653 --> 00:29:37,962
-Yeah. We cool.
-l'm sorry about--

333
00:29:38,213 --> 00:29:42,604
Don't worry. We cool, Lazy Boy. Okay?

334
00:29:42,853 --> 00:29:44,445
-We're cool.
-All right.

335
00:29:44,653 --> 00:29:48,202
You two have a nice night. Okay?

336
00:29:48,413 --> 00:29:49,846
All right.

337
00:29:58,373 --> 00:30:00,443
What the hell was that all about?

338
00:30:04,933 --> 00:30:05,922
What the hell?

339
00:30:10,213 --> 00:30:13,808
-What's that?
-Stop playing this shit, man.

340
00:30:15,613 --> 00:30:16,602
Get down!

341
00:31:03,693 --> 00:31:04,921
Freeze! L.A.P.D.

342
00:31:08,813 --> 00:31:10,041
What do l do?

343
00:31:10,253 --> 00:31:12,164
Cut, cut, cut, cut. Cut.

344
00:31:13,533 --> 00:31:14,932
Let's do it again.

345
00:31:15,733 --> 00:31:16,768
Freeze! L.A.P.D.

346
00:31:18,733 --> 00:31:20,086
That how he's doing it?

347
00:31:20,333 --> 00:31:24,326
l'm laying my shit out.
Freeze! L.A.P.D. That shit is right.

348
00:31:24,533 --> 00:31:25,522
Ready?

349
00:31:25,853 --> 00:31:28,287
Patrolling your area at Friday. . . .

350
00:31:28,613 --> 00:31:31,002
Friday night at 8. Eight.

351
00:31:31,373 --> 00:31:33,443
Patrolling every Friday at 8.

352
00:31:33,613 --> 00:31:35,968
Yeah, good, and be happy.

353
00:31:36,173 --> 00:31:38,164
Why should l? l'm patrolling.

354
00:31:38,373 --> 00:31:41,570
You're happy because
you're patrolling.

355
00:31:41,773 --> 00:31:43,206
Keeping it safe, Mitch.

356
00:31:43,493 --> 00:31:45,768
Patrolling every Friday at night.

357
00:31:46,093 --> 00:31:48,004
Every Friday night at 8.

358
00:31:51,533 --> 00:31:55,526
This guy is the worst actor
l have ever seen.

359
00:31:57,613 --> 00:32:00,730
-Get out.
-Wait a minute, hold it, cut, cut.

360
00:32:00,933 --> 00:32:04,482
Mitch, you can't just
toss a cameraman aside.

361
00:32:04,653 --> 00:32:09,443
Give me a pad, l'll show you
how a TV cop comes through the door.

362
00:32:09,693 --> 00:32:12,161
The doors fly open.

363
00:32:12,333 --> 00:32:15,723
They fly open. You burst in.
You scan the room.

364
00:32:15,933 --> 00:32:20,245
You do the turn, toss yourself around.
And now! You're set and--

365
00:32:20,453 --> 00:32:23,331
But don't turn your head
too far from camera.

366
00:32:23,533 --> 00:32:28,129
That little lady is your lover. Don't
respect her, she won't respect you.

367
00:32:28,333 --> 00:32:31,370
-Always know where she is.
-She's in my way.

368
00:32:31,573 --> 00:32:34,565
What's wrong?
You're getting tips from T.J. Hooker.

369
00:32:34,733 --> 00:32:38,009
Which is the most underrated show
in history.

370
00:32:38,213 --> 00:32:41,762
-Nobody came through a door like you.
-Thank you.

371
00:32:41,933 --> 00:32:45,323
-This guy is no detective.
-l'm playing a detective.

372
00:32:45,533 --> 00:32:48,093
-l'm playing detective.
-All right, guys.

373
00:32:48,293 --> 00:32:50,329
-l'm playing a detective.
-Okay.

374
00:32:50,893 --> 00:32:53,407
Let's go do some hood-jumping.

375
00:32:53,973 --> 00:32:54,962
What's that?

376
00:32:55,173 --> 00:32:59,007
-What do you think? We jump over hoods.
-Something you'd know.

377
00:32:59,693 --> 00:33:00,682
Freeze!

378
00:33:01,613 --> 00:33:06,448
That was great, Trey.
Beautiful. That was really great.

379
00:33:06,653 --> 00:33:11,602
-Okay, Mitch. Come here.
-l'm not going on the hood of a car.

380
00:33:11,813 --> 00:33:13,769
-What do you mean?
-Forget it.

381
00:33:13,933 --> 00:33:18,085
l entertained viewers everywhere
in the '80s, jumping on car hoods.

382
00:33:18,293 --> 00:33:21,603
One of a TV cop's greatest weapons.
l'll show you.

383
00:33:22,733 --> 00:33:27,523
You gotta stop them, see? Halt!
And you throw your body. Halt!

384
00:33:30,813 --> 00:33:32,041
You okay, T.J.?

385
00:33:38,053 --> 00:33:39,042
Moving on.

386
00:33:39,373 --> 00:33:40,852
Who stole the money?

387
00:33:41,053 --> 00:33:42,406
Deep in thought.

388
00:33:42,573 --> 00:33:46,248
Now the eyebrows arch,
ever so slightly.

389
00:33:46,893 --> 00:33:49,043
And Hooker solves another case.

390
00:33:49,253 --> 00:33:53,132
Okay? All right, Trey, you try it.
Go ahead. Ready?

391
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:56,007
-Get loose now. Loosen up. Ready?
-Yeah.

392
00:33:56,813 --> 00:33:58,804
Trey, who stole the money?

393
00:33:59,373 --> 00:34:04,128
Good. You nailed it, first take.
Give me five. That was good!

394
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:07,848
Okay, Mitch.
Come on, show me some magic.

395
00:34:08,093 --> 00:34:10,482
Mitch, who stole the money?

396
00:34:12,973 --> 00:34:14,725
Look at that, Trey. Look.

397
00:34:14,933 --> 00:34:17,925
Look at the anger in his eyes.
Look at that.

398
00:34:18,173 --> 00:34:22,132
See, that slight squint says,
''Hey, l'm Mitch. l'm the man.

399
00:34:23,133 --> 00:34:25,522
Don't mess with me. ''

400
00:34:26,093 --> 00:34:28,368
Okay. Let's taste some drugs.

401
00:34:28,533 --> 00:34:32,003
Hooker's got a bag
of white powder in his hand.

402
00:34:32,173 --> 00:34:34,971
Spears it open with a pocketknife.

403
00:34:35,893 --> 00:34:38,168
Takes his little pinkie. . .

404
00:34:38,373 --> 00:34:40,284
. . .in the powder.

405
00:34:40,893 --> 00:34:44,647
And he touches it,
gently, on his tongue.

406
00:34:46,293 --> 00:34:47,772
Watch the eyebrows.

407
00:34:48,213 --> 00:34:50,329
Hooker knows it's cocaine.

408
00:34:51,053 --> 00:34:52,452
What if it's cyanide?

409
00:34:56,533 --> 00:35:00,890
Hello? Hold on. There's a reason
real cops don't taste drugs, Bill.

410
00:35:01,573 --> 00:35:03,245
lt's never cyanide.

411
00:35:03,413 --> 00:35:05,768
Show me the thing with your eyebrow.

412
00:35:05,973 --> 00:35:08,168
-Okay, l'm on my way.
-lt's tricky.

413
00:35:08,493 --> 00:35:12,611
-Where are you going?
-l gotta wash this shit out of my hair.

414
00:35:12,813 --> 00:35:16,249
We have some action?
We have some action, finally.

415
00:35:27,653 --> 00:35:29,405
-Beep, beep!
-Hey, Mitch.

416
00:35:29,573 --> 00:35:32,610
-What'd you do to my car?
-We added micro cameras.

417
00:35:32,773 --> 00:35:37,085
ln the wheel, the glove compartment
and a crook-cam in the back.

418
00:35:37,253 --> 00:35:39,847
-Pretend they're not there.
-Pretend.

419
00:35:40,013 --> 00:35:44,643
-See? You're catching on already.
-We'll be right behind you in the van.

420
00:35:44,813 --> 00:35:47,202
You'll be right behind me?

421
00:35:55,173 --> 00:35:56,401
What are you doing?

422
00:35:56,573 --> 00:36:00,282
l'm on the case. l'm your partner.
We're together.

423
00:36:01,213 --> 00:36:03,408
Unbelievable.

424
00:36:04,373 --> 00:36:06,011
What's the mean face for?

425
00:36:06,333 --> 00:36:08,289
Listen. Don't speak, listen.

426
00:36:08,453 --> 00:36:11,570
There's a few things
l need to tell you.

427
00:36:11,933 --> 00:36:16,006
First of all, you gotta know
that l got your back covered. . .

428
00:36:16,213 --> 00:36:18,807
. . .and l gotta know
you got mine covered.

429
00:36:18,973 --> 00:36:20,088
No doubt.

430
00:36:20,253 --> 00:36:25,247
When we're on the job you're
the only person l can depend on.

431
00:36:25,413 --> 00:36:28,371
Not friends, family,
not anybody, just you.

432
00:36:28,613 --> 00:36:29,602
You got that?

433
00:36:29,773 --> 00:36:32,651
That's important.
There's no other way.

434
00:36:32,813 --> 00:36:35,202
And it's gotta start right now.

435
00:36:37,773 --> 00:36:41,766
You know, ever since l was 8,
l wanted to be a cop.

436
00:36:42,093 --> 00:36:45,165
l wanted to be on the force
like Uncle Reggie.

437
00:36:45,373 --> 00:36:48,968
He was the first in the family
on the force. Big muscles.

438
00:36:49,133 --> 00:36:50,202
Uncle Reggie.

439
00:36:50,853 --> 00:36:54,050
He used to let me ride
in the squad car with him.

440
00:36:54,213 --> 00:36:57,091
Once he let me play with the siren.
From then on. . .

441
00:36:57,253 --> 00:36:59,528
. . .l knew l was gonna be a cop.

442
00:36:59,693 --> 00:37:01,206
Uncle Reggie.

443
00:37:02,093 --> 00:37:03,446
Yeah.

444
00:37:03,973 --> 00:37:05,725
My uncle--

445
00:37:08,333 --> 00:37:11,086
Uncle Reggie passed away
two years ago.

446
00:37:11,253 --> 00:37:13,972
He got caught in the line
of some fire.

447
00:37:15,013 --> 00:37:18,801
Didn't slow me down.
l remember how he set me on my way.

448
00:37:19,013 --> 00:37:22,926
He's looking down on me
from a big precinct in the sky.

449
00:37:23,133 --> 00:37:28,332
He's thinking, ''You've done all right,
Trey. You've done right by me. ''

450
00:37:31,373 --> 00:37:34,092
What does that
got to do with anything?

451
00:37:34,253 --> 00:37:38,132
-You got a speech, so l get a speech.
-That wasn't a speech.

452
00:37:38,333 --> 00:37:40,893
That ''l'm your partner. ''
That was a speech.

453
00:37:41,213 --> 00:37:44,603
You burned up 90 seconds of air.
That was a speech.

454
00:37:44,813 --> 00:37:48,772
When we get to the crime scene,
stay out of my way.

455
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:51,606
This isn't studio shit.
This is real.

456
00:37:58,133 --> 00:38:00,931
-Get your camera out of here.
-Hey, watch it.

457
00:38:01,133 --> 00:38:03,567
Julio has to shoot. That's the show.

458
00:38:03,733 --> 00:38:06,122
-He's done. . . .
-Jerry Springer.

459
00:38:06,293 --> 00:38:09,251
That's right. Whatever you need,
l'm there.

460
00:38:09,413 --> 00:38:14,407
lf l get shot, stabbed, it's cool.
Whatever. l'm getting good footage.

461
00:38:14,573 --> 00:38:18,009
Just remember three words:
Go to Trey.

462
00:38:18,173 --> 00:38:19,242
-l'm Trey.
-Julio.

463
00:38:19,453 --> 00:38:22,490
-You worked on Springer?
-Springer, Girls Gone Wild.

464
00:38:22,693 --> 00:38:25,571
Get that camera out of here.
Who's in the bag?

465
00:38:25,773 --> 00:38:26,967
We don't know yet.

466
00:38:27,173 --> 00:38:30,165
Whoever shot him didn't care
for open caskets.

467
00:38:30,333 --> 00:38:32,244
Thinking what l'm thinking?

468
00:38:32,413 --> 00:38:34,165
l seriously doubt it.

469
00:38:34,893 --> 00:38:38,124
l'm thinking there's dirty
cops on the streets. . .

470
00:38:38,333 --> 00:38:41,689
. . .cleaning the streets up
on they own terms, partner.

471
00:38:41,893 --> 00:38:44,965
This is payback for a drug deal
gone sour.

472
00:38:45,453 --> 00:38:47,762
Whoever this guy worked for
got pissed.

473
00:38:48,013 --> 00:38:51,528
Even better. This is a bad guy
retribution scenario.

474
00:38:51,733 --> 00:38:54,566
Good thinking, partner.
Good thinking.

475
00:38:56,813 --> 00:38:59,771
l think l can identify
one of the victims.

476
00:39:02,293 --> 00:39:05,808
Those are 1 2-gauge, armor-piercing
uranium shells.

477
00:39:05,973 --> 00:39:07,486
-Charlie.
-Hey, Mitchell.

478
00:39:07,653 --> 00:39:11,202
l found explosive and incendiary
rounds scattered around.

479
00:39:11,453 --> 00:39:14,684
The same gun that put holes
in your TV repair shop.

480
00:39:14,853 --> 00:39:19,290
lt appears to be hand-held, automatic,
with interchangeable magazines.

481
00:39:19,493 --> 00:39:22,087
Technically, this gun doesn't exist.

482
00:39:22,333 --> 00:39:26,008
-What do you mean?
-This gun is like the 50-foot shark.

483
00:39:26,173 --> 00:39:27,526
Speak English.

484
00:39:27,733 --> 00:39:30,566
lt's out there,
but nobody's ever seen it.

485
00:39:31,093 --> 00:39:33,209
Any idea who made it?

486
00:39:34,213 --> 00:39:38,570
lt's a custom job. My guess is,
it's out of Eastern Europe.

487
00:39:38,973 --> 00:39:42,329
-Thanks, Charlie. Keep your eyes open.
-You bet.

488
00:39:47,373 --> 00:39:49,489
-What are you doing?
-Take it easy.

489
00:39:49,693 --> 00:39:54,403
-You're not supposed to touch.
-l didn't. l turned it over.

490
00:39:54,573 --> 00:39:57,292
-Let me know when you touch--
-l don't have to--

491
00:39:57,453 --> 00:40:00,889
-What's going on?
-He's contaminating my crime scene.

492
00:40:01,093 --> 00:40:03,766
l'm doing a sweep of the area.

493
00:40:03,973 --> 00:40:08,410
You never know where a crucial
bit of evidence may be hiding.

494
00:40:08,973 --> 00:40:10,850
Like this, for instance.

495
00:40:11,053 --> 00:40:15,365
Did anybody think to pull some prints
off this water bottle?

496
00:40:15,773 --> 00:40:17,889
Can l get an evidence bag?

497
00:40:18,093 --> 00:40:21,449
Put down my water.
l'm not finished drinking it.

498
00:40:23,293 --> 00:40:25,011
That's an honest mistake.

499
00:40:25,213 --> 00:40:30,207
You got your water amongst potential
evidence so l thought it was. . . .

500
00:40:30,413 --> 00:40:33,564
Hey, T.J., go solve the case
somewhere else.

501
00:40:33,893 --> 00:40:35,804
Don't give me orders,
l'm your partner!

502
00:40:36,013 --> 00:40:38,243
No, l partner with real cops.

503
00:40:38,653 --> 00:40:41,690
-Get me a copy of that report.
-All right, Mitch.

504
00:40:41,853 --> 00:40:45,163
Well, l am your partner,
so you better accept that.

505
00:40:45,413 --> 00:40:46,732
l am your partner!

506
00:40:49,373 --> 00:40:54,322
He won't open up. You know how hard
it is to work with somebody like that?

507
00:40:54,493 --> 00:40:59,408
l know. Mitch has been a lot
more resistant than l'd hoped for.

508
00:40:59,613 --> 00:41:02,969
l think that you and Mitch
need some bonding time.

509
00:41:03,493 --> 00:41:05,051
You're right. We do.

510
00:41:05,253 --> 00:41:10,168
We need some QT time together.
Two guys hanging out, have some beers.

511
00:41:10,333 --> 00:41:13,245
l'll call to see
if he wants to hang out.

512
00:41:14,013 --> 00:41:17,130
Let's not call him.
Let's just go over.

513
00:41:17,533 --> 00:41:19,728
-Just show up?
-Surprise him.

514
00:41:22,293 --> 00:41:23,806
What are you doing?

515
00:41:24,133 --> 00:41:27,648
How hard is it to say,
''Hi, Trey, nice to see you''?

516
00:41:27,853 --> 00:41:30,003
Hi, Trey. What are you doing here?

517
00:41:30,213 --> 00:41:33,171
We got off on the wrong foot.
l got some food.

518
00:41:33,373 --> 00:41:36,206
We can eat the food and bond a bit.

519
00:41:36,773 --> 00:41:38,650
-Bond?
-Yeah.

520
00:41:38,813 --> 00:41:40,929
How'd you get my address?

521
00:41:41,773 --> 00:41:44,162
-Hi, Mitch.
-Oh, shit.

522
00:41:44,413 --> 00:41:46,051
-Yeah.
-l gave it to him.

523
00:41:46,253 --> 00:41:49,404
-Will you invite us in? Don't be rude.
-Do l have to?

524
00:41:49,773 --> 00:41:53,129
You got us out in the hall
like a Jehovah's Witness.

525
00:41:53,293 --> 00:41:55,966
l gotta see where my star cop lives.

526
00:41:56,133 --> 00:41:57,725
Come on, Mitch.

527
00:41:59,173 --> 00:42:01,971
-Oh, my God.
-Mitch. . . !

528
00:42:04,733 --> 00:42:06,086
Nice.

529
00:42:06,253 --> 00:42:10,212
Got a little smell to it.
Not a stinky smell, an odd one.

530
00:42:10,413 --> 00:42:11,607
What is that smell?

531
00:42:11,773 --> 00:42:14,241
ls this here your actual living area?

532
00:42:14,413 --> 00:42:19,851
This is my Batcave. A tunnel
in the garage leads to my mansion.

533
00:42:22,013 --> 00:42:23,765
What's the problem?

534
00:42:23,973 --> 00:42:28,524
Research tells us buddy cops
live in visually distinctive places.

535
00:42:28,693 --> 00:42:34,165
Like a trailer on the beach or
a loft downtown. That kind of thing.

536
00:42:34,333 --> 00:42:37,723
Your research shows that, huh?
Where does he live?

537
00:42:38,213 --> 00:42:41,046
l rent a guesthouse from a producer.

538
00:42:41,213 --> 00:42:43,966
-Kind of gives off a Magnum vibe.
-Totally.

539
00:42:44,173 --> 00:42:48,007
lt's unique. You know what, Mitch?
We can make this work.

540
00:42:48,333 --> 00:42:50,608
Did a crackhead make this cup?

541
00:42:51,613 --> 00:42:55,526
-lt's not visually exciting enough?
-No. lt's just--

542
00:42:56,013 --> 00:43:00,962
The point is to let the audience
in on all aspects of your life.

543
00:43:01,173 --> 00:43:05,928
They want to spend time in a place
that speaks to your personality.

544
00:43:06,093 --> 00:43:08,766
This does speak to my personality.

545
00:43:09,173 --> 00:43:13,132
Mitch, l think you need some time
away from the job.

546
00:43:13,493 --> 00:43:16,132
l just found the crackhead's shop.

547
00:43:16,653 --> 00:43:18,245
Hey, don't go in there.

548
00:43:18,413 --> 00:43:21,291
This is what you smell
all over the place.

549
00:43:21,453 --> 00:43:24,570
Wow, a pottery studio!

550
00:43:24,813 --> 00:43:28,123
You're full of surprises.
How long you been doing this?

551
00:43:28,293 --> 00:43:32,332
-Six years, give or take.
-You really got a knack for it.

552
00:43:32,493 --> 00:43:35,291
This room's off-limits.
lt's not for show.

553
00:43:35,493 --> 00:43:37,688
Okay, Mitch.

554
00:43:37,893 --> 00:43:40,805
We haven't done any bonding
at all yet.

555
00:43:41,173 --> 00:43:43,767
Bond with yourself, l got work to do.

556
00:44:48,853 --> 00:44:50,002
Check this out.

557
00:44:50,173 --> 00:44:52,971
Must be some Hollywood dickhead.

558
00:45:43,693 --> 00:45:47,481
-Not bad, huh?
-A cop never slides across the hood.

559
00:45:47,693 --> 00:45:52,642
-Why? lt's not police procedure?
-Your holster scratches the paint.

560
00:45:57,693 --> 00:45:58,921
Nice.

561
00:46:01,693 --> 00:46:03,888
They can buff that shit out.

562
00:46:04,213 --> 00:46:07,091
-l'm trying for detective.
-You take the exam?

563
00:46:07,253 --> 00:46:10,165
-Twice.
-And you think you won't fail again?

564
00:46:10,333 --> 00:46:12,449
Now l'm working with Mitch Preston.

565
00:46:12,653 --> 00:46:17,283
Give me some tips, and l'll tip you
on how to look better on camera.

566
00:46:17,493 --> 00:46:22,089
-Tips like what?
-You wear plaids, like fishermen.

567
00:46:22,253 --> 00:46:26,212
That's ugly shit. Wear solids.
You look slimmer on camera.

568
00:46:26,613 --> 00:46:29,491
-l'll keep that in mind.
-Got any tips for me?

569
00:46:29,653 --> 00:46:33,089
Yeah, stay out of my way
and l won't shoot you.

570
00:46:35,173 --> 00:46:37,050
What the hell's going on?

571
00:46:37,253 --> 00:46:41,883
Welcome to America's window
on your world.

572
00:46:42,853 --> 00:46:43,842
What is this?

573
00:46:44,013 --> 00:46:47,847
-We made your workspace camera-ready.
-My workspace?

574
00:46:48,053 --> 00:46:52,285
l think it captures the reality
of an inner-city precinct.

575
00:46:52,493 --> 00:46:54,723
ls this where you do the makeup?

576
00:46:54,893 --> 00:46:59,409
No. This is good. You have to see it.
Mitch, you have to see this.

577
00:46:59,973 --> 00:47:03,761
-Look at your desk. lt's so beautiful.
-ls this my desk?

578
00:47:03,973 --> 00:47:08,205
That's your desk. And that's yours,
Mitch. We didn't change it.

579
00:47:08,493 --> 00:47:11,769
But this is a confessional. All right?

580
00:47:11,933 --> 00:47:13,969
Talk about anything you want.

581
00:47:14,173 --> 00:47:16,812
You can talk about the job,
each other. . .

582
00:47:16,973 --> 00:47:21,330
. . .your sex lives. l mean,
only if you want to. Direct to camera.

583
00:47:21,533 --> 00:47:25,492
-No, thanks.
-You could put a pottery wheel there.

584
00:47:25,733 --> 00:47:28,964
Look, Mitch, this is an integral
part of the show.

585
00:47:29,173 --> 00:47:32,643
You're obligated to spend
five minutes a day in here.

586
00:47:32,853 --> 00:47:36,971
We've provided a chair.
All you have to do is sit and share.

587
00:47:37,133 --> 00:47:40,091
-Share?
-Learn how to turn on your heart light.

588
00:47:40,293 --> 00:47:41,885
-Exactly.
-Chase!

589
00:47:42,093 --> 00:47:44,561
Brad loves the promo footage.

590
00:47:44,773 --> 00:47:49,244
-But they need a catch phrase.
-l got one. ''l wish l was dead. ''

591
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:51,888
You need a catch phrase? l got it.

592
00:47:53,293 --> 00:47:57,206
-When l'm about to make a bust--
-When did you ever make a bust?

593
00:47:58,013 --> 00:47:59,048
Don't tell me.

594
00:47:59,213 --> 00:48:03,047
When l'm about to make a bust,
to get in the moment. . .

595
00:48:03,213 --> 00:48:08,810
. . .l take three deep breaths and say to
myself, ''Okay, Trey, it's showtime! ''

596
00:48:09,013 --> 00:48:11,243
-You say that?
-That's stupid.

597
00:48:11,413 --> 00:48:13,449
-What's stupid about it?
-Know what?

598
00:48:13,613 --> 00:48:15,683
Don't say it, please.

599
00:48:15,853 --> 00:48:19,402
No, l have to say it, Mitch.
''Showtime. '' lt's amazing.

600
00:48:19,613 --> 00:48:25,165
-That could be the name of our show!
-See? lt's not stupid. lt's perfect.

601
00:48:25,733 --> 00:48:27,724
Say it again for the camera.

602
00:48:27,933 --> 00:48:32,484
Do it again with the breathing.
My God, you're a natural.

603
00:48:34,013 --> 00:48:35,002
lt's showtime!

604
00:48:49,293 --> 00:48:54,526
This is Harley Barley taking calls
from fans of the new series Showtime.

605
00:48:54,733 --> 00:48:58,521
Let's go to Pete from Idaho.
You're on the air.

606
00:48:58,733 --> 00:49:01,770
I wanted to say to Mitch,
I know how you feel.

607
00:49:01,933 --> 00:49:05,562
I mean, I got a lot of anger
inside me too.

608
00:49:05,813 --> 00:49:08,930
I want to take my gun
and blow everybody away!

609
00:49:09,133 --> 00:49:12,762
Thank you, Pete.
You sure you're not calling from Waco?

610
00:49:12,933 --> 00:49:15,731
Let's go to line three.
Mandy, you're on.

611
00:49:15,933 --> 00:49:21,530
I just love me some Showtime.
I'm your biggest fan. Trey is so fine.

612
00:49:21,733 --> 00:49:23,644
-I could ride that.
-What?

613
00:49:23,853 --> 00:49:25,445
Thank you, Mandy.

614
00:49:25,613 --> 00:49:29,128
I'm on Showtime. What's up?

615
00:49:35,213 --> 00:49:37,204
Trey! Marry me, Trey!

616
00:49:37,373 --> 00:49:39,523
Marry me, Trey!

617
00:49:41,653 --> 00:49:43,928
I'm gonna be honest, you know.

618
00:49:44,133 --> 00:49:47,762
It's natural, when you're in
a situation that's shitty...

619
00:49:48,093 --> 00:49:52,848
... to think about what it might be
like to have a different partner.

620
00:49:56,773 --> 00:49:59,651
Like somebody that was
closer to your age.

621
00:49:59,853 --> 00:50:02,606
Charismatic, with a little flair
and shit.

622
00:50:02,813 --> 00:50:05,407
You kicking it with him,
have some fun.

623
00:50:07,693 --> 00:50:11,845
Me and a Wesley Snipes type.
I know you won 't get Wesley.

624
00:50:12,053 --> 00:50:14,851
I see Wesley Snipes types
all the time.

625
00:50:15,053 --> 00:50:18,011
Me and a Wesley Snipes type?

626
00:50:18,213 --> 00:50:20,169
Can you imagine?

627
00:50:21,253 --> 00:50:22,481
Wesley Snipes type?

628
00:50:28,573 --> 00:50:31,690
Do you feel lucky, punk?
Huh? Do you?

629
00:50:32,013 --> 00:50:37,007
Basically, I'm saying the whole show
is slowed down just a half a beat...

630
00:50:37,333 --> 00:50:41,690
-I'm too old for this shit.
-...so Mitch can keep up.

631
00:50:41,893 --> 00:50:45,169
Because I'm working out.
I do free-weights.

632
00:50:45,333 --> 00:50:46,812
Go ahead. Make my day.

633
00:50:47,093 --> 00:50:49,766
I'm taking care of mine. Mitch is not.

634
00:50:51,773 --> 00:50:55,243
That's it. I'm taking care of mine
and Mitch is not.

635
00:50:55,453 --> 00:50:58,570
Trey, look at this. lt's all for you.

636
00:51:18,893 --> 00:51:22,363
-Trey, I'm right here.
-Yo, Trey.

637
00:51:32,933 --> 00:51:34,491
Five minutes up yet?

638
00:51:42,653 --> 00:51:44,052
It's showtime!

639
00:52:06,653 --> 00:52:09,213
What are you looking at that for,
Magnum?

640
00:52:12,126 --> 00:52:16,278
-How come we're not talking to him?
-Because he's sitting in county.

641
00:52:16,486 --> 00:52:19,558
A jailhouse.
That could be the next episode.

642
00:52:19,806 --> 00:52:22,115
Forget it. l put him there.

643
00:52:22,406 --> 00:52:25,000
He's the one who knows
about this gun.

644
00:52:25,166 --> 00:52:28,283
He won't talk to me. l already tried.

645
00:52:29,446 --> 00:52:30,561
He'll talk to me.

646
00:52:30,806 --> 00:52:33,320
What makes you think
he'll talk to you?

647
00:52:33,526 --> 00:52:36,165
l won't go in like a bulldog like you.

648
00:52:36,326 --> 00:52:39,796
-l'll talk. l'll be in character.
-ln character!

649
00:52:40,446 --> 00:52:43,518
That's great.
You mean, like undercover?

650
00:52:43,726 --> 00:52:48,925
A little finesse, catch him off guard,
have him think l'm someone else.

651
00:52:49,526 --> 00:52:52,757
Character. What kind of a character?

652
00:52:53,366 --> 00:52:54,640
l don't know.

653
00:52:58,006 --> 00:53:02,921
ReRun! How you doing, my man? l'm Trey
Sellars from the Justice Channel.

654
00:53:03,126 --> 00:53:07,005
-Have a seat, please. You being strong?
-Yeah.

655
00:53:07,206 --> 00:53:11,916
-Thanks for coming. You okay?
-I ain 't heard of no Justice Channel.

656
00:53:12,126 --> 00:53:16,563
That's because we got started
while you was rotting away in here.

657
00:53:16,846 --> 00:53:21,397
The Justice Channel is devoted to
shining the light on victims like you.

658
00:53:21,566 --> 00:53:25,798
-He's got talent, Mitch, come on.
-We're wasting our time.

659
00:53:26,366 --> 00:53:28,516
ls that a new shirt?

660
00:53:28,686 --> 00:53:31,246
lt looks good. l like you in solids.

661
00:53:31,406 --> 00:53:34,443
What's this shit about you
getting me out?

662
00:53:34,606 --> 00:53:39,726
Not me, brother, the TV show.
l'm hosting a show called Framed.

663
00:53:40,046 --> 00:53:43,436
Let me tell you about the show.
We spotlight you.

664
00:53:43,646 --> 00:53:47,559
Put a light on your situation.
Let the people see you.

665
00:53:47,766 --> 00:53:52,078
Hopefully, we get a grassroot
campaign started and get you out.

666
00:53:52,286 --> 00:53:55,244
l got three people out.
You can be number four.

667
00:53:55,406 --> 00:53:59,285
-Like Mandela.
-Similar. You ain't as noble.

668
00:53:59,446 --> 00:54:02,597
You ain't no Nelson. You're ReRun.

669
00:54:02,766 --> 00:54:05,234
You your own man. We want ReRun out.

670
00:54:05,406 --> 00:54:07,715
Mandela's shit stink too.

671
00:54:07,886 --> 00:54:10,002
Trey, l'll talk you through this.

672
00:54:10,246 --> 00:54:11,884
-Not so loud.
-Say what?

673
00:54:12,206 --> 00:54:14,356
l wasn't that loud.

674
00:54:14,526 --> 00:54:17,484
You don't have to talk too loud.

675
00:54:17,646 --> 00:54:19,762
Shouldn't my lawyer be here?

676
00:54:19,966 --> 00:54:23,925
That's the wrong thing you can do.
Let me explain something.

677
00:54:24,086 --> 00:54:27,396
Research has shown people
don't want to hear lawyers.

678
00:54:27,566 --> 00:54:30,683
They want to hear it
straight from your mouth.

679
00:54:30,846 --> 00:54:33,644
l got Johnnie Cochran.
No offense, bro.

680
00:54:33,846 --> 00:54:37,122
Cochran will get a response
l'm not trying to get.

681
00:54:37,286 --> 00:54:40,198
l'm trying to get people
to connect with you.

682
00:54:40,406 --> 00:54:43,239
lf they see Johnnie Cochran
in a $ 1 000 suit. . .

683
00:54:43,406 --> 00:54:46,478
. . .they ain't going to get you
out of prison.

684
00:54:46,686 --> 00:54:50,474
Ain't no cops here.
Just me and you. Brother to brother.

685
00:54:50,686 --> 00:54:51,914
l'm your brother.

686
00:54:52,086 --> 00:54:56,079
Take it slow. Nice and easy.
He's still on the fence.

687
00:54:56,886 --> 00:55:01,004
All right! You and Lazy Boy
got this gun from somebody!

688
00:55:01,166 --> 00:55:04,522
You work for the same person!
Who you working for?

689
00:55:04,686 --> 00:55:07,917
What the hell?
What kind of reporter are you?

690
00:55:08,086 --> 00:55:11,078
-l don't tiptoe around the truth!
-Back off.

691
00:55:11,286 --> 00:55:15,643
And l will not back off
until l find out the truth!

692
00:55:16,446 --> 00:55:20,678
Brother, look at me. They selling
your black ass down the river.

693
00:55:20,926 --> 00:55:22,325
You say ''ass'' on TV?

694
00:55:22,526 --> 00:55:25,484
This is cable.
l can say whatever l want to.

695
00:55:25,646 --> 00:55:27,716
Did they tell you plea-bargain?

696
00:55:27,886 --> 00:55:29,638
Take the hit, do the time?

697
00:55:29,806 --> 00:55:32,001
That's what was said, isn't it?

698
00:55:33,726 --> 00:55:34,761
Yeah.

699
00:55:35,966 --> 00:55:38,116
See if you can get a name.

700
00:55:38,286 --> 00:55:39,719
It's time, ReRun.

701
00:55:39,886 --> 00:55:43,276
lt is time to shine the light
on who's behind this.

702
00:55:43,486 --> 00:55:45,875
Who's the puppet master?

703
00:55:46,166 --> 00:55:48,600
Whose time are you doing?

704
00:55:48,766 --> 00:55:51,599
While you're in here
he's smelling freedom.

705
00:55:51,806 --> 00:55:53,876
-And tasting it.
-What you smell?

706
00:55:54,046 --> 00:55:57,959
-Ass.
-Ass and feet, and tension and stress.

707
00:55:58,126 --> 00:56:02,483
Hey, brother, that ain't for you.
Look in that camera right now.

708
00:56:02,646 --> 00:56:05,479
Make a connection.
Look right into the lens.

709
00:56:05,646 --> 00:56:09,480
Say who it is that's supposed to be
in here instead of you.

710
00:56:09,646 --> 00:56:12,683
Look in the camera and say it.
I'm with you.

711
00:56:13,166 --> 00:56:15,077
l'm right here with you.

712
00:56:16,206 --> 00:56:19,357
All the people out there in TV land. . .

713
00:56:19,526 --> 00:56:21,994
. . .and Mama, l'm coming home soon. . . .

714
00:56:22,206 --> 00:56:26,040
-Your baby be home soon, Mama.
-Yes.

715
00:56:26,206 --> 00:56:27,400
The culprit...

716
00:56:27,566 --> 00:56:29,158
You'll see Mama soon.

717
00:56:29,366 --> 00:56:33,564
... that put me on the streets
to do his dirty work...

718
00:56:33,726 --> 00:56:36,160
. . .that's shitting on my freedom. . .

719
00:56:36,326 --> 00:56:37,645
Tell them.

720
00:56:37,846 --> 00:56:39,916
. . .is none other. . .

721
00:56:40,366 --> 00:56:42,561
This is an emotional moment.

722
00:56:42,766 --> 00:56:47,282
I get caught up when I know a brother
is ready to leave. I love it.

723
00:56:51,966 --> 00:56:53,843
... than Vargas!

724
00:56:55,286 --> 00:56:56,685
Caesar Vargas!

725
00:56:57,326 --> 00:56:58,361
He said it!

726
00:56:59,566 --> 00:57:01,682
Hope you're watching, bitch.

727
00:57:01,846 --> 00:57:04,440
-Shit.
-You did the right thing, brother.

728
00:57:04,606 --> 00:57:05,959
Find out where he is.

729
00:57:06,166 --> 00:57:09,841
-You going down, baby.
-You made a connection.

730
00:57:10,006 --> 00:57:13,999
When the people see this,
they'll get rallied up. l can tell.

731
00:57:14,206 --> 00:57:17,437
Now, where would a guy
like Vargas kick it?

732
00:57:18,526 --> 00:57:21,404
-You trying to get a brother killed--
-Not at all.

733
00:57:21,606 --> 00:57:24,837
l do this for the viewers.
We don't point fingers.

734
00:57:25,006 --> 00:57:29,875
We'll say, ''lf you don't want to run
into Vargas don't go to this place. ''

735
00:57:30,086 --> 00:57:36,082
Hanging out with him, you wind up
in this place. That's how you got here.

736
00:57:36,246 --> 00:57:38,316
Look to the camera.

737
00:57:38,526 --> 00:57:43,077
Think about the babies, the children.
Save the babies, brother.

738
00:57:43,886 --> 00:57:45,478
People...

739
00:57:45,686 --> 00:57:49,998
...and children in TV land and all
the little kids around the world...

740
00:57:50,166 --> 00:57:52,043
. . .don't be like me.

741
00:57:52,206 --> 00:57:55,403
And if you want to stay
out of harm's way. . .

742
00:57:58,326 --> 00:58:01,841
. . .don't go to Club Cuba Loca
on Figueroa.

743
00:58:02,046 --> 00:58:04,435
It's a bad place. Don 't go.

744
00:58:05,726 --> 00:58:06,795
He's just lucky.

745
00:58:07,006 --> 00:58:10,840
Brother, you did the right thing.
Don't you feel good?

746
00:58:11,526 --> 00:58:14,199
-We connected.
-A weight off my shoulders.

747
00:58:14,366 --> 00:58:17,164
You going down, bitch.
l got backup now.

748
00:58:17,686 --> 00:58:19,483
Hey, that's a wrap.

749
00:58:20,126 --> 00:58:22,276
Yeah! Come on, Mitch.

750
00:58:22,486 --> 00:58:25,717
Now it's time for us
to get down to my story.

751
00:58:25,886 --> 00:58:29,720
l was born in a corn field,
Grandma was a stripper--

752
00:58:29,926 --> 00:58:33,680
Save all that for when you do
The Oprah Winfrey Show.

753
00:58:33,886 --> 00:58:36,036
Yo, we going to the club tonight.

754
00:58:55,286 --> 00:58:56,924
Now what?

755
00:59:00,126 --> 00:59:01,878
Watch me.

756
00:59:06,206 --> 00:59:09,642
ls the mike on?
Can you turn the mike up?

757
00:59:15,246 --> 00:59:19,080
Sorry to bother everybody.
ls Mr. Vargas here?

758
00:59:21,006 --> 00:59:24,123
Anybody know where Mr. Vargas is?
Mr. Vargas?

759
00:59:24,286 --> 00:59:26,595
There he is.
See how easy that was?

760
00:59:26,766 --> 00:59:29,041
Don't get up, we'll come to you.

761
00:59:29,406 --> 00:59:31,124
Sorry. Go on back. . .

762
00:59:31,326 --> 00:59:33,794
. . .to living la vida loca.

763
00:59:34,606 --> 00:59:38,918
Sorry, l always wanted to do that.
Be right with you, Mr. Vargas.

764
00:59:43,886 --> 00:59:45,365
lnteresting approach.

765
00:59:45,526 --> 00:59:48,643
Just doing my part.
He's over this way.

766
00:59:59,486 --> 01:00:02,842
-That button-cam was a good idea.
-Yeah, l told you.

767
01:00:11,886 --> 01:00:13,638
-Mr. Vargas?
-Yes.

768
01:00:13,846 --> 01:00:18,476
l'm Detective Preston, L.A.P.D.
l'd like to ask you some questions.

769
01:00:18,686 --> 01:00:21,120
l am in the middle of dinner.

770
01:00:21,766 --> 01:00:26,203
-Hope this doesn't ruin your appetite.
-l got a strong stomach.

771
01:00:27,446 --> 01:00:31,519
-Who's he?
-One of your employees. You know that.

772
01:00:31,966 --> 01:00:35,561
A lot of people work for me.
l don't know this guy.

773
01:00:36,166 --> 01:00:38,361
And what about this guy?

774
01:00:41,326 --> 01:00:43,237
What's his name?

775
01:00:48,126 --> 01:00:49,684
He's big. . .

776
01:00:50,126 --> 01:00:54,597
. . .probably big enough to go through
those bulletproof vests you wear.

777
01:00:56,406 --> 01:00:57,521
Am l right?

778
01:01:00,206 --> 01:01:02,879
Bulletproof vest, huh?

779
01:01:03,246 --> 01:01:04,361
And you are. . .?

780
01:01:04,686 --> 01:01:08,804
You can't miss me. l'm across
the street on the billboard.

781
01:01:10,486 --> 01:01:12,078
You are the TV cops.

782
01:01:12,606 --> 01:01:14,597
Right.

783
01:01:14,846 --> 01:01:16,598
What's your line again?

784
01:01:16,806 --> 01:01:18,205
''lt's showtime! ''

785
01:01:18,846 --> 01:01:21,155
lt's showtime!

786
01:01:22,446 --> 01:01:24,084
l told you it was good.

787
01:01:24,286 --> 01:01:26,720
See how funny this is
once we arrest you.

788
01:01:27,046 --> 01:01:28,195
And then what?

789
01:01:28,526 --> 01:01:31,563
What'll you do?
Try me in The People's Court?

790
01:01:31,726 --> 01:01:35,480
We're gonna be watching
your punk ass 24-7, slick.

791
01:01:37,686 --> 01:01:40,041
Are you going to arrest me?

792
01:01:40,846 --> 01:01:45,397
Because if you're not, get out.
Or l have to call the real cops.

793
01:01:45,566 --> 01:01:48,524
-Hey, we are the real cops.
-Sure you are.

794
01:01:48,686 --> 01:01:52,315
-You don't think we're real cops?
-l think you're a joke.

795
01:01:54,086 --> 01:01:56,600
lt's all right. He cannot touch me.

796
01:01:56,806 --> 01:02:02,005
Not this time, but next time
l'll drag you out of here in cuffs.

797
01:02:03,326 --> 01:02:05,203
You see, l told you.

798
01:02:05,406 --> 01:02:07,601
They are a joke.

799
01:02:08,006 --> 01:02:08,995
Right?

800
01:02:18,846 --> 01:02:21,883
-lt's a joke. lt's a Showtime joke.
-Showtime.

801
01:02:31,166 --> 01:02:32,724
That's great TV!

802
01:02:42,366 --> 01:02:46,678
We can take this car and meet girls
who wouldn't normally look at us.

803
01:02:46,886 --> 01:02:48,524
Yeah, l'll pass.

804
01:02:48,726 --> 01:02:51,445
You gotta go whip up
some dinner plates?

805
01:02:51,646 --> 01:02:56,197
-Why don't you stop the car?
-All right, l'll leave you alone.

806
01:03:02,966 --> 01:03:06,959
-What's this, your picture and rsum?
-Those are my 8-by-1 0s.

807
01:03:07,246 --> 01:03:08,565
l just want to look.

808
01:03:09,086 --> 01:03:12,203
All these special skills
must come in handy, huh?

809
01:03:12,366 --> 01:03:13,640
l've never. . .

810
01:03:13,846 --> 01:03:15,757
. . .never met a. . .

811
01:03:15,966 --> 01:03:18,400
. . .mime. ls that it? Mime?

812
01:03:18,566 --> 01:03:20,443
Yeah, l'm a mime. l mime.

813
01:03:21,006 --> 01:03:24,521
l'm curious about these movies:
Beach Party Bonzo?

814
01:03:24,686 --> 01:03:29,680
Yes, it's a semi-independent film.
Very low-budget, semi-independent.

815
01:03:29,886 --> 01:03:33,162
Planet Gorthon, 3 1 A.D. ?

816
01:03:33,926 --> 01:03:37,805
Kind of light porn,
but l don't even want to go into it.

817
01:03:38,286 --> 01:03:41,323
You try out for the Village People?

818
01:03:42,086 --> 01:03:45,999
-l'm adding pottery to that list.
-Don't knock pottery.

819
01:03:46,366 --> 01:03:50,803
Of all the things a man can do,
why would somebody throw a pot?

820
01:03:51,526 --> 01:03:55,075
-lf l tell you, will you drop it?
-Please tell me.

821
01:03:55,246 --> 01:04:00,195
My marriage counselor. My ex and l were
on the rocks. He said get a hobby.

822
01:04:00,406 --> 01:04:02,283
-And that's it?
-That's it.

823
01:04:02,646 --> 01:04:04,841
Why are you so crappy at it?

824
01:04:05,006 --> 01:04:08,362
lt's like you and work.
l never took it seriously.

825
01:04:08,926 --> 01:04:11,599
-Can l ask you something?
-Yeah.

826
01:04:11,766 --> 01:04:14,280
Why'd you become a cop, anyway?

827
01:04:14,606 --> 01:04:19,157
-Because l was a shitty waiter.
-You mean you were a better mime?

828
01:04:19,326 --> 01:04:24,639
l was an excellent mime. Still am.
Would you like to see my skills?

829
01:04:25,006 --> 01:04:26,803
l got the car. Don't worry.

830
01:04:27,766 --> 01:04:30,917
See? Now my face
is against the glass.

831
01:04:32,606 --> 01:04:34,562
You can mime words too. Watch.

832
01:04:34,766 --> 01:04:37,326
-Fuck you.
-Okay.

833
01:04:37,726 --> 01:04:39,796
l'm impressed.

834
01:04:40,726 --> 01:04:42,956
There's a glass wall here.

835
01:04:50,606 --> 01:04:51,880
Thanks for the ride.

836
01:04:52,086 --> 01:04:56,602
-We got to bond, don't you think?
-No. Not really.

837
01:04:59,166 --> 01:05:01,999
-What?
-l never leave my lights on.

838
01:05:09,246 --> 01:05:10,599
Surprise!

839
01:05:10,766 --> 01:05:12,119
What did you do?

840
01:05:12,286 --> 01:05:14,595
-You don't like it?
-No, l don't.

841
01:05:15,686 --> 01:05:18,644
Tell Don Johnson
we found his apartment.

842
01:05:18,846 --> 01:05:22,680
l don't know what you were thinking.
l want it back. Now!

843
01:05:22,886 --> 01:05:25,002
Okay, Mitch. Just relax, okay?

844
01:05:25,206 --> 01:05:28,994
We didn't touch the pottery.
We're giving you sex appeal.

845
01:05:29,166 --> 01:05:31,964
lt looks like a gay porno star
lives here.

846
01:05:32,166 --> 01:05:34,202
And here they are, right here.

847
01:05:34,406 --> 01:05:35,555
Just stop.

848
01:05:35,766 --> 01:05:39,076
You can't change the place
without my permission.

849
01:05:39,246 --> 01:05:42,443
You don't have the right.
Get this dog out.

850
01:05:43,166 --> 01:05:44,679
Powder's yours.

851
01:05:44,846 --> 01:05:47,565
Mine? l don't want some dog.
What is this?

852
01:05:47,766 --> 01:05:50,678
He used to be a drug sniffer
in the K-9 unit.

853
01:05:50,886 --> 01:05:52,444
He looks like an addict.

854
01:05:52,606 --> 01:05:57,316
-He makes you look sympathetic.
-A kennel won't make him sympathetic.

855
01:05:57,526 --> 01:06:00,359
Want me to be sympathetic?
Put my stuff back.

856
01:06:00,526 --> 01:06:03,643
l'll be sympathetic.
Until then, l won't be.

857
01:06:04,646 --> 01:06:07,718
How can you say no to that face,
Mitch?

858
01:06:09,166 --> 01:06:12,044
l can say no very easily.
No, Powder. Get out.

859
01:06:12,206 --> 01:06:13,764
Don't be like that.

860
01:06:13,966 --> 01:06:15,240
lt's just a dog, man.

861
01:06:15,446 --> 01:06:17,960
Come here, Powder.
You're a good boy.

862
01:06:20,246 --> 01:06:21,361
Shit!

863
01:06:21,566 --> 01:06:24,205
Maybe Mitch is right.
Get rid of the dog.

864
01:06:24,366 --> 01:06:26,596
l don't know.
l like his instincts.

865
01:06:27,086 --> 01:06:28,724
Watch your ass, Powder.

866
01:06:50,126 --> 01:06:51,718
Okay. Move it.

867
01:07:00,806 --> 01:07:03,240
Dispatch, this is Armor 323--

868
01:07:11,846 --> 01:07:12,881
Go! Go!

869
01:07:31,566 --> 01:07:32,760
Go.

870
01:07:59,086 --> 01:08:01,884
This is Showtime One.
We're on it.

871
01:08:15,606 --> 01:08:16,834
Okay.

872
01:08:17,046 --> 01:08:19,924
Annie, get the dish up.
Julio, go!

873
01:08:29,006 --> 01:08:30,837
That's definitely our gun.

874
01:08:32,286 --> 01:08:33,275
Watch it!

875
01:09:12,206 --> 01:09:13,321
Hey! Hey!

876
01:09:16,366 --> 01:09:19,005
-Let's go!
-Move it!

877
01:10:30,606 --> 01:10:32,278
Damn! We lost picture!

878
01:10:41,686 --> 01:10:43,085
Slow down!

879
01:11:19,486 --> 01:11:20,680
There he is!

880
01:11:20,846 --> 01:11:22,040
l got him!

881
01:11:29,486 --> 01:11:31,477
-lncoming!
-Watch it!

882
01:11:42,206 --> 01:11:44,276
-You getting this?
-Yeah!

883
01:11:48,246 --> 01:11:49,645
Jump!

884
01:11:49,806 --> 01:11:51,080
Jump! Jump!

885
01:11:51,886 --> 01:11:54,081
You gotta jump! Now!

886
01:11:54,286 --> 01:11:55,799
-Come on, Mitch!
-Do it!

887
01:12:14,206 --> 01:12:16,674
Now that was some good hood-jumping!

888
01:12:17,086 --> 01:12:18,758
You all right?

889
01:12:18,966 --> 01:12:20,365
You okay?

890
01:12:20,526 --> 01:12:22,801
l think two drops of pee came out.

891
01:12:28,006 --> 01:12:31,635
You're off the show, Sellars.
You're busted to patrol.

892
01:12:42,006 --> 01:12:43,758
Showtime is over.

893
01:12:43,966 --> 01:12:46,116
And we're screwed.

894
01:12:46,926 --> 01:12:49,884
See you back on the tape, Top Cop.

895
01:12:53,486 --> 01:12:56,842
Being a police officer is not
what you see on TV!

896
01:12:57,006 --> 01:12:59,839
l've never seen you do
anything like this!

897
01:13:00,046 --> 01:13:02,799
Your showboating
put this city at risk.

898
01:13:03,006 --> 01:13:05,236
l expect that of Trey, not you.

899
01:13:05,446 --> 01:13:07,562
lt just escalated.

900
01:13:07,726 --> 01:13:12,356
Mitch, it's over. lt's over.
Chief is pulling the plug on the show.

901
01:13:12,526 --> 01:13:17,236
-Good. Now l can get back to work.
-No, you can't. You're off the case.

902
01:13:17,526 --> 01:13:20,165
-What?
-PR is having a heart attack.

903
01:13:20,326 --> 01:13:23,159
This is worse than
when you shot the camera.

904
01:13:23,366 --> 01:13:26,881
lf Vargas gets more guns,
we'll be even worse off.

905
01:13:27,086 --> 01:13:31,477
You blew it. l'm relieving you of
duty, pending an investigation.

906
01:13:32,006 --> 01:13:36,636
What, do you want me to turn in
my gun and my badge? Ben, come on.

907
01:13:36,846 --> 01:13:40,475
l just want you to go home
till this shitstorm settles.

908
01:13:40,686 --> 01:13:42,916
What am l supposed to do at home?

909
01:13:43,086 --> 01:13:46,237
l don't know. Read a book.
Watch some TV.

910
01:13:46,446 --> 01:13:48,960
Do your pottery projects.

911
01:13:53,406 --> 01:13:54,680
What?

912
01:13:55,886 --> 01:13:57,160
What?

913
01:13:58,286 --> 01:14:00,436
He's touching the pecker-cam.

914
01:14:01,846 --> 01:14:03,723
There's a lens in those eyes.

915
01:14:03,886 --> 01:14:04,875
My woodpecker?

916
01:14:05,086 --> 01:14:07,441
-Don't break it.
-I said no cameras.

917
01:14:09,006 --> 01:14:11,839
l hope you got all of this.
You hear me?

918
01:14:12,046 --> 01:14:13,479
I hope you got it all.

919
01:14:15,286 --> 01:14:16,435
He broke it.

920
01:14:19,446 --> 01:14:21,164
l'll get you another one.

921
01:14:21,366 --> 01:14:24,756
Talk to him. He's got issues.
He hates cameras.

922
01:14:42,846 --> 01:14:45,679
-We're here to take the dog.
-The dog stays.

923
01:14:46,006 --> 01:14:48,156
-We have orders.
-He's an officer.

924
01:14:48,326 --> 01:14:51,124
Touch him and l'll shoot you.

925
01:14:56,246 --> 01:14:57,645
Go, go, go.

926
01:14:58,126 --> 01:15:00,765
Good boy, Powder. Good boy.

927
01:15:02,286 --> 01:15:04,038
Nobody will take you away.

928
01:15:04,206 --> 01:15:08,119
Trey, forget Showtime.
We'll do our own buddy cop show.

929
01:15:08,326 --> 01:15:11,875
l got a treatment worked out
in my head. Check it.

930
01:15:12,046 --> 01:15:14,435
You're Nick Load, and l'm John Lock.

931
01:15:14,646 --> 01:15:16,841
-Nick who?
-Nick Load.

932
01:15:17,046 --> 01:15:21,324
You're Nick Load. l'm John Lock.
Together, we're Lock and Load.

933
01:15:21,486 --> 01:15:24,876
We are the baddest bicycle cops
on Venice Beach.

934
01:15:25,086 --> 01:15:27,236
ls that hot shit, or what?

935
01:15:27,526 --> 01:15:30,563
Listen, George Clooney
had 1 8 shows fail. . .

936
01:15:30,766 --> 01:15:33,883
. . .before he hit big with ER.
So you see?

937
01:15:35,006 --> 01:15:38,442
l don't wanna be the guy
putting up the caution tape.

938
01:15:38,646 --> 01:15:40,841
l was feeling this detective thing.

939
01:15:41,006 --> 01:15:44,681
Listen, you have heat
on your acting career right now.

940
01:15:44,846 --> 01:15:48,998
lf you don't strike while the iron
is hot, it'll pass you by.

941
01:15:49,966 --> 01:15:54,721
Whatever. l'm gonna go see
this last episode of Showtime.

942
01:16:02,766 --> 01:16:05,155
You had your food. None for you.

943
01:16:06,446 --> 01:16:10,121
You're off the show, Sellars.
You're busted to patrol.

944
01:16:10,286 --> 01:16:13,358
-What happens to Mitch?
-He's relieved of duty.

945
01:16:13,566 --> 01:16:17,525
Mitch is my partner.
He's the only person I can depend on.

946
01:16:17,726 --> 01:16:20,718
Not my family, not my friends.
Just him.

947
01:16:20,926 --> 01:16:24,521
That's beautiful, Sellars.
What do you want me to do?

948
01:16:24,686 --> 01:16:29,635
-If he's relieved, I should be.
-If you want it, you're relieved too.

949
01:16:29,846 --> 01:16:31,120
Okay.

950
01:16:32,246 --> 01:16:34,885
-I'm relieved, then.
-Okay.

951
01:16:35,086 --> 01:16:38,123
-Want my gun and badge?
-Get out of here.

952
01:16:38,326 --> 01:16:39,805
All right.

953
01:16:52,086 --> 01:16:55,840
-Who is this?
-lt's me, Mitch.

954
01:16:56,046 --> 01:16:57,559
What do you want?

955
01:16:57,766 --> 01:17:02,396
-Are you watching the show?
-No, l'm not. lt's ancient history.

956
01:17:02,766 --> 01:17:06,202
-New day, new way.
-Me too. l'm eating a TV dinner.

957
01:17:06,406 --> 01:17:11,560
-So what's up?
-l just, you know. . . .

958
01:17:11,726 --> 01:17:14,115
l wanted to tell you that. . .

959
01:17:14,926 --> 01:17:18,919
. . .what you did was a pretty
standup thing and. . .

960
01:17:19,326 --> 01:17:22,955
. . .if you take that detective exam,
l'm there for you.

961
01:17:23,126 --> 01:17:25,401
Whatever questions, l'll be around.

962
01:17:25,606 --> 01:17:29,394
-l'd make a great detective?
-You'd make an okay detective.

963
01:17:30,286 --> 01:17:33,358
-Let me get that on my machine.
-l'm hanging up.

964
01:17:33,566 --> 01:17:34,794
No. Quick question.

965
01:17:35,006 --> 01:17:39,238
Could you make me a pair of those
shitty-ass mugs that you make?

966
01:17:40,046 --> 01:17:43,356
-You gotta be kidding.
-Relax. l'm just joking, man.

967
01:17:43,566 --> 01:17:45,443
No, something on the show.

968
01:17:45,646 --> 01:17:48,206
-So you are watching the show.
-Yeah.

969
01:17:48,406 --> 01:17:52,684
-Me too. What did you see?
-Charlie Hertz, works for ballistics.

970
01:17:52,886 --> 01:17:57,482
-That guy outside Lazy Boy's.
-Yeah, but l gotta see it again.

971
01:17:57,686 --> 01:18:00,837
Don't worry, l'm recording it.
l record them all.

972
01:18:01,046 --> 01:18:04,482
-Why am l not surprised?
-Let me rewind this thing.

973
01:18:08,646 --> 01:18:10,637
-lt is Charlie Hertz.
-lt is?

974
01:18:10,846 --> 01:18:14,043
-lt's definitely him.
-What's he doing with Vargas?

975
01:18:37,886 --> 01:18:39,524
Where are the lights?

976
01:18:44,446 --> 01:18:47,165
We definitely found our gunmaker.

977
01:18:48,006 --> 01:18:50,156
This is definitely his workshop.

978
01:18:50,926 --> 01:18:52,598
Look at all this shit.

979
01:18:53,286 --> 01:18:57,074
What happened to the days
when people just grew pot?

980
01:18:57,286 --> 01:18:59,516
How about we star-69 his last call?

981
01:19:00,846 --> 01:19:02,996
King Rental Trucks,
may I help you?

982
01:19:03,286 --> 01:19:05,675
This is Detective Mitch Preston--

983
01:19:05,886 --> 01:19:09,003
You mean the Mitch Preston?
The one on Showtime?

984
01:19:09,166 --> 01:19:11,361
-That's me.
-Oh, my God!

985
01:19:11,766 --> 01:19:16,237
Calm down, we just need some
information about a truck.

986
01:19:16,446 --> 01:19:20,644
-Did you rent one to a Charles Hertz?
-I'll just check, honey.

987
01:19:20,846 --> 01:19:23,485
Mr. Hertz picked one up this morning.

988
01:19:23,686 --> 01:19:27,759
-Was there a tracking device on it?
-Yes, Mitch, there was.

989
01:19:28,686 --> 01:19:31,041
Is Trey with you?
Can I speak to him?

990
01:19:31,246 --> 01:19:32,679
Sure, here.

991
01:19:32,846 --> 01:19:35,235
-Trey? This Trey?
-Yeah.

992
01:19:35,446 --> 01:19:37,641
I love you, baby!
Say, ''Showtime. ''

993
01:19:37,806 --> 01:19:40,081
lt's showtime!
This bitch is crazy.

994
01:19:40,286 --> 01:19:44,325
Okay, all right. Bye-bye.
See how popular l am?

995
01:19:47,526 --> 01:19:48,675
All right, thanks.

996
01:19:48,846 --> 01:19:51,565
We got a hit on the truck
at the Bonaventure.

997
01:19:51,766 --> 01:19:53,677
-What's going on?
-Gun show.

998
01:20:10,566 --> 01:20:12,522
Nice guns.

999
01:20:12,686 --> 01:20:14,438
Come on back.

1000
01:20:15,326 --> 01:20:16,600
lt's okay.

1001
01:20:41,246 --> 01:20:43,635
-Thanks for the call.
-Find that footage?

1002
01:20:43,846 --> 01:20:46,121
Here are the printouts.
Good luck.

1003
01:20:46,286 --> 01:20:47,719
You went out on a limb.

1004
01:20:47,926 --> 01:20:51,396
l want to help. Plus l need
an ending for the finale.

1005
01:20:59,566 --> 01:21:00,999
Excuse me.

1006
01:21:01,646 --> 01:21:02,920
Hello, gun lovers.

1007
01:21:03,126 --> 01:21:07,722
My name is Chase Renzi
from the hit series Showtime.

1008
01:21:09,606 --> 01:21:12,245
That's sweet. Very sweet, very sweet.

1009
01:21:12,446 --> 01:21:15,006
l'm here because we need your help.

1010
01:21:15,206 --> 01:21:18,357
We believe these two men
are in the building.

1011
01:21:18,566 --> 01:21:22,081
They are armed
and extremely dangerous.

1012
01:21:22,566 --> 01:21:23,919
What the hell?

1013
01:21:24,686 --> 01:21:26,165
There they are!

1014
01:21:33,446 --> 01:21:34,595
Vargas!

1015
01:21:50,566 --> 01:21:51,555
Don't move.

1016
01:21:57,966 --> 01:22:00,196
Oh, shit!

1017
01:22:05,206 --> 01:22:06,355
Mitch!

1018
01:22:16,646 --> 01:22:17,761
Guys, wait up!

1019
01:22:17,966 --> 01:22:22,278
-Roger that.
-Ghost 3, Bonaventure Hotel.

1020
01:22:23,246 --> 01:22:26,443
Why don't l go up and
make a nice list of demands?

1021
01:22:26,766 --> 01:22:28,199
l can help you here.

1022
01:22:46,606 --> 01:22:51,077
-Get in!
-Just take it easy, all right? Easy!

1023
01:22:58,046 --> 01:22:59,957
Vargas? There's no way out.

1024
01:23:00,166 --> 01:23:01,724
l've got a list of demands.

1025
01:23:01,886 --> 01:23:04,354
Let us in and tell us what they are.

1026
01:23:04,526 --> 01:23:07,757
All right. But first, slide your
weapons in here.

1027
01:23:07,926 --> 01:23:10,804
-What did you say?
-l don't know. What?

1028
01:23:11,006 --> 01:23:12,678
Slide your weapons in here.

1029
01:23:12,846 --> 01:23:14,916
-What?
-What'd you say?

1030
01:23:15,086 --> 01:23:17,520
You don't understand English?

1031
01:23:17,686 --> 01:23:19,119
Slide in your weapons.

1032
01:23:19,326 --> 01:23:22,238
Slide the weapons.
lt's okay. l got a backup.

1033
01:23:22,446 --> 01:23:25,085
Hold on. l gotta change the tape.

1034
01:23:28,606 --> 01:23:31,564
-You thinking what l'm thinking?
-Yeah, l am.

1035
01:23:34,166 --> 01:23:37,044
-What are you doing?
-Shut up.

1036
01:23:37,246 --> 01:23:38,281
Mitch, no.

1037
01:23:38,446 --> 01:23:40,960
-Did you hear me?
-Hold on.

1038
01:23:41,166 --> 01:23:43,077
Don't do that. Man!

1039
01:23:44,246 --> 01:23:45,565
l've got demands.

1040
01:23:45,766 --> 01:23:49,475
See those news choppers out there?
We're hooked in live.

1041
01:23:49,646 --> 01:23:54,117
We have a cameraman out here so
you can tell the world what you want.

1042
01:23:55,286 --> 01:23:58,596
Okay. Throw in your weapons.

1043
01:23:58,766 --> 01:24:00,722
Here they come.

1044
01:24:11,206 --> 01:24:12,195
Ready?

1045
01:24:16,206 --> 01:24:17,764
There are the guns.

1046
01:24:17,966 --> 01:24:19,558
-Stay there.
-Easy.

1047
01:24:19,846 --> 01:24:22,280
-Stay there.
-Okay. Just take it easy.

1048
01:24:22,446 --> 01:24:25,085
-Where's the cameraman?
-He's afraid.

1049
01:24:25,286 --> 01:24:28,995
We don't want to put him in danger,
so he'll do the shooting.

1050
01:24:29,166 --> 01:24:30,281
l'll do it.

1051
01:24:30,446 --> 01:24:32,960
You ever been on TV before?

1052
01:24:33,606 --> 01:24:36,882
lt's very simple.
Look at the red light.

1053
01:24:37,086 --> 01:24:39,884
Tell the people what's on your mind.

1054
01:24:41,006 --> 01:24:42,917
You got him all lined up?

1055
01:24:44,086 --> 01:24:46,281
Yeah. Let's shoot.

1056
01:24:46,806 --> 01:24:50,196
Okay. All right.
lt's showtime.

1057
01:25:21,126 --> 01:25:22,559
You okay?

1058
01:25:30,286 --> 01:25:31,844
Mitch?

1059
01:25:50,166 --> 01:25:52,600
-Trey! Where are you?
-Over here!

1060
01:25:56,446 --> 01:25:58,914
-What are you doing?
-Hold on!

1061
01:26:04,286 --> 01:26:05,560
Oh, God!

1062
01:26:18,006 --> 01:26:22,318
Now it's your turn to smile
for the cameras.

1063
01:26:26,406 --> 01:26:30,479
-Get that camera out of here!
-Keep that camera where it is!

1064
01:26:46,846 --> 01:26:49,963
Annie, you deal with it, girl.

1065
01:26:50,846 --> 01:26:54,077
What's going on
with your new recruits?

1066
01:26:54,286 --> 01:26:57,323
l'm tired of your voice.
You're on my last nerve.

1067
01:26:57,486 --> 01:27:01,035
-They're not bonding.
-They don't have our chemistry.

1068
01:27:01,246 --> 01:27:05,797
Which is why you ought
to guest star in the next episode.

1069
01:27:05,966 --> 01:27:08,196
-Not in a million years.
-That's a yes.

1070
01:27:08,406 --> 01:27:11,159

l'm working on him.

1071
01:27:13,566 --> 01:27:15,079
See you at 8, Mitch.

1072
01:27:15,246 --> 01:27:19,398
Look at what you get. What do l get?
Nothing. l'm going to work.

1073
01:27:21,526 --> 01:27:25,155
l made you something.
For passing the detective exam.

1074
01:27:25,366 --> 01:27:27,561
That is nice of you to do that.

1075
01:27:31,166 --> 01:27:33,521
Mitch, that's nice.

1076
01:27:34,726 --> 01:27:36,364
What is that?

1077
01:27:36,646 --> 01:27:41,640
-What is it? lt's a loose change dish.
-Of course it's a loose change dish.

1078
01:27:41,806 --> 01:27:45,640
l haven't seen this level of
craftsmanship since kindergarten.

1079
01:27:45,806 --> 01:27:47,683
lt's appreciated, partner.

1080
01:27:47,886 --> 01:27:52,038
-Detectives, your suspect's waiting.
-Be right with you.

1081
01:27:52,206 --> 01:27:55,403
''Detective Sellars. ''
lt has a nice ring to it.

1082
01:27:55,566 --> 01:27:58,080
Come on, Top Cop, it's showtime.

1083
01:27:59,446 --> 01:28:01,721
Hi. l'm Detective Mitch Preston.

1089
01:28:15,606 --> 01:28:18,757
This Preston character
needs to come to life.

1090
01:28:18,926 --> 01:28:20,996
He doesn't have any balls.

1091
01:28:21,206 --> 01:28:22,764
Well, he has balls.

1092
01:28:22,926 --> 01:28:25,645
They gotta come out.
Bada-bing, bada-boom balls.

1093
01:28:26,286 --> 01:28:28,083
Do you feel lucky, punk?

1094
01:28:29,046 --> 01:28:30,195
Who said that?

1095
01:28:30,366 --> 01:28:31,355

Could you come a little closer?

l'm sorry, l did the wrong thing.

1100
01:28:51,726 --> 01:28:56,277
Wrap me up in caution tape,

You need a daddy?
Yes or no?

''Oh, Bill. '' That's what l get now.
