1
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,720
Look alive!

2
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,000
Damn it!
Goddamn it!

3
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:34,400
You call that blocking,
you pussy-pukes?

4
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:36,520
You gotta pick up
the linebacker!

5
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:40,160
Goddamn it! Get off the fucking field,
you limp-ass blowdicks!

6
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,680
Consider yourselves dead
Friday night! Dead!

7
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,640
You gonna rejoin
the living tomorrow, Stan?

8
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,040
You've got to feel the pressure
closing in on you!

9
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,120
Then you get rid of the rock!

10
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:57,480
Now get focused
or get the fuck off my team!

11
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,280
- Shit!
- Let it go.

12
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,520
This better be important or somebody's
gonna be doing laps until sunrise.

13
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,560
Yeah? What?

14
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:54,560
Please let me finish this
so we can go home. It's late.

15
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,360
Mrs Brummel, with all sadness,
no new computers.

16
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,520
- Oh, but--
- Get the service guy down here
and get the old ones juiced.

17
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,760
Mr Tate,
you're dreaming.

18
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,640
Absolutely no field trips
to New York City.

19
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,560
I don't think
that you understand.

20
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,520
You're not getting out
of Ohio. Rethink it.

21
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,200
And, finally,
Mrs Olson.

22
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,240
There's just no money
for a musical this year.

23
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,280
But I bet the football team gets their
new jerseys and their new equipment.

24
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:30,160
Have you seen the football stadium
on a Friday night, Mr Tate?

25
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:33,960
The entire town is there. This is
a football town, let me remind you,

26
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:37,200
and, yes, the team will get
new jerseys and new knee pads...

27
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,400
and new jock straps and anything else
they want in the name of education...

28
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,120
because that is what
the school board wants.

29
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,200
Because that is what
the parents in this town want.

30
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,120
I'm sorry.

31
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,320
My frustrated hands are tied.

32
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,600
I don't see why we can't have
a few new computers...

33
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,160
so the children will learn
a little set up.

34
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:06,920
Miss Drake, the Drama Club had their
heart set on Guys and Dolls this year.

35
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:12,000
Well... maybe if they use
last year's set from Our Town.

36
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,720
Shit, I forgot my keys.
I have to go back.

37
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,760
See you in the morning,
Mrs Olson.

38
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,800
Coach Willis.
What can I do for you?

39
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:10,120
You look...
very, very pretty tonight,

40
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,520
- Miss Drake.
- Have you been drinking, Coach?

41
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:16,600
I'm sorry to bother you,
but, uh...

42
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:21,840
I can't seem to find a pencil.

43
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,040
You don't need a pencil, Coach.
You need a good night's sleep.

44
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,160
- I need a pencil.
- Sleep it off, Coach.

45
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,120
Do you have a pencil?

46
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:34,560
Jesus Christ, yes, I have a pencil.
I have plenty of pencils.

47
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,960
Look, why don't you and your pencil
go home. It's late.

48
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:45,320
You look...
very, very pretty tonight.

49
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:48,960
Harassment has a really fine line,
Coach. Haven't you read your handbook?

50
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,480
-
- I've always wanted to do that.

51
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,280
Would Miss Drake please report...

52
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,120
to the principal's office?

53
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,480
-
- Oh!

54
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:52,160
- I forgot my grade book.
- Unlock the door!
Coach Willis attacked me!

55
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,080
- Unlock the door, goddamn it!
- I don't have my keys.

56
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,960
- Let me get help.
- No, don't leave me!

57
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,400
- Where are your keys?
- Wait--

58
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,840
In the office.

59
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,800
I'm gonna get my keys now,
Mrs Olson.

60
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,720
- Please, let me get help.
-
No, just talk to me, okay?

61
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,440
Miss Drake...

62
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,480
please be careful.

63
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,920
He's insane.

64
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,240
-
- Miss Drake, he's coming!

65
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,360
Hurry! Hurry!

66
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,080
Hurry, Miss Drake!
Hurry!

67
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,320
-
- Hurry!

68
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,960
- Shit!
- No!

69
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,640
Hurry!

70
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,720
Help me!

71
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,240
-
- Prick.

72
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,440
I always wanted to do that.

73
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:33,600
You fucking bitch!

74
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,880
What the hell
were you doing?

75
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:44,560
Whatever.
All right?

76
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,360
Sorry. My fault.

77
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,320
Crash and burn, Casey.

78
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,000
Get out of the fucking car,
you stupid bitch!

79
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,480
Goddamn you!

80
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,200
- Whoa, whoa. You okay?
- Walk much?

81
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,440
You ran into me, beast.

82
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,680
Okay, now listen up. Since
we're all wearing the same uniforms,

83
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,600
Iet's keep
the hair the same.

84
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,920
No hair spray, no teasing,
just elegant.

85
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,080
- Simple. Great.
- Hey.

86
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:22,520
Ooh, Stan, watch it. Those are Estee
Lauder lips. Takes 72 minutes to apply.

87
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,440
Sorry.

88
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,840
- Hey, can we talk?
- I can't right now.

89
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,080
I need a new headline
for the school paper. It's important.

90
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,960
- So is this.
- I'm sure you think so, honey.

91
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:36,480
In fact... it could be just the story
you're looking for.

92
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,480
Do the words "editor-in-chief"
mean anything to you?

93
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,480
Leave the news
to me, okay?

94
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,960
Later.

95
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,120
-
- That chick weakens legs, meat.

96
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,360
- One, two, three--
- No, not the pole!

97
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,880
Oh! Yeah, do it again!

98
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,920
Yeah!|

99
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,120
Excuse me.

100
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:04,920
Could you please tell me where
the office is? It's my first day here.

101
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:11,080
Thank you.
I'm Marybeth Louise Hutchinson.

102
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:14,200
I really love what you've done
with your nose ring. It brings
out the colour in your eyes.

103
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,760
You're such a fucking pussy.
Hey, fuck you! Fuck you!

104
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:28,800
Fuck you, man!
Fuck you!

105
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,760
Dude, that's not me.

106
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,920
Doesn't even look like me.

107
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,280
It's fifty bucks,
right?

108
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,560
- Does that look like me?
- It's the new you.

109
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:49,080
I don't know, man. How do we
know these things are even gonna work?

110
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,760
Trust me, man.
I'm brilliant.

111
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Then why are you repeating
your senior year?

112
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,960
All right, look, man.

113
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,240
I'll throw in
a couple hits of this.

114
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:05,000
Scat. My own recipe.
Guaranteed to jack you up.

115
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,280
Up the nose, right?

116
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,720
Whatever works, man.

117
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,920
Fuck.

118
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,320
-
- Excuse me, Mr Tate.

119
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:38,080
Try to remember, Harry,
the projector's got teeth.

120
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,680
Sharp ones.

121
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:43,200
We should be getting hazard
pay for this sort of faulty equipment.

122
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,440
- Yeah, right.
- Hey, good morning, Miss Harper.

123
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,720
- I, uh-- I called you this weekend.
-

124
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:52,440
I got your machine.
How's your cold?

125
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:56,600
- Oh, I can't get rid of it.
- Hello. How are you today?

126
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:00,000
-
- A bit tired,
but no complaints.

127
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,120
- Oh.
- I-l got it.

128
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:07,160
Can we say,
"retirement"?

129
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,960
-
- Maybe you should just go home.

130
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,880
No, thank you.

131
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:17,080
I'm saving my sick days
for when I feel better.

132
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,800
Maybe I should just put
a pen in my eye.

133
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,320
When will that bitch turn
the air conditioning back on?

134
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,040
Hey, speaking of which,
has anybody seen Principal Drake?

135
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:38,280
Oh, maybe she had
a sunstroke and died.

136
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,720
What's up with the coach?
He's thirsty.

137
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:50,040
Probably a pregame ritual.

138
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,760
Just looking at him
makes me want to take a piss.

139
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,600
Good morning, Mrs Olson.

140
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,520
You look
very, very pretty today.

141
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:21,640
So, um...
what was Crusoe's...

142
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,560
greatest fear?

143
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,840
Anyone?

144
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,280
Uh, yes, Zeke.

145
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:38,280
Crusoe's afraid that he'd be
stuck on that island forever...

146
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,200
with nothing but calluses.

147
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,600
-
- No, that's not correct.

148
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:46,120
Isolation
was his greatest fear.

149
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,320
Yes, but...

150
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,720
his external existence
in no way compared...

151
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,800
to the internal agony
of the loneliness he felt.

152
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,560
That's very good.

153
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,560
- Like I said, calluses.
-

154
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,080
So Cathy tells me one thing,
and then Liz says another...

155
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,000
and then, of course,
Jenny's got her own story,

156
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,080
so which one
do you want me to print?

157
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,000
Print them all.
He's a jerk.

158
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,240
- Hey, we need to talk.
- No, Stan, baby, I'm in a crunch.

159
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,160
Could we back-burner it?

160
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,040
- I'm quitting football.
- You're not playing tomorrow?

161
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,920
I'm not playing this year.
Would you listen to me?

162
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:26,120
I'm quitting the team.
I'm not playing ball... anymore.

163
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,960
- What brought this on?
-

164
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,280
Well, I've been weighing
the importance of being a jock...

165
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:35,640
- with my impending future,
and I decided--
- You just decided?

166
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,680
Stan, what about college? The football
scholarship is your only shot.

167
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:41,200
If I quit now, I can work
harder at studying,

168
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,600
maybe raise
my grades a little.

169
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:47,320
I'd rather go to college...
based on my intellect.

170
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,320
You're not good
at studying.

171
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,200
Stan, you're good at football.
Stick to what you're good at.

172
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,800
Yeah, I've always been good
at football and basketball
and every other sport I try.

173
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:59,480
I think maybe it's time I try something
I'm not so good at, something different.

174
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:02,360
And what am I supposed to do
while you're on a yellow-brick
quest for a brain?

175
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:05,520
- What?
- The accepted social order...

176
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:09,280
is head cheerleaders date star
quarterbacks, not academic wanna-bes.

177
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,520
Don't be superficial.

178
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,320
"Superficial. "
Four syllables.

179
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,600
That's really good, Stan.
You're on your way.

180
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,640
Let me know how
the cancer cure goes.

181
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:24,880
I was hoping
you'd be with me on this.

182
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:40,600
Now, if everyone will turn
to chapter four:

183
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:43,320
"The Nation of the State. "

184
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:46,520
"Only through conformity
among the masses...

185
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:52,280
can the unified state offer the benefits
of power order and security. "

186
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:56,280
Actually, we covered that
last week, Mr Tate.

187
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,480
We're on chapter five.

188
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,920
Whatever.

189
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:05,560
Now if you could all please
join Stan on chapter five:

190
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:08,480
"lndividual Action in Society. "

191
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,040
What are you reading?

192
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,880
Double Star.
Robert Heinlein.

193
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:30,400
You one of those
science fiction people?

194
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:35,280
Y'all believe in alternate universes
and alien beings and stuff?

195
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,760
I'm feeling pretty alien
myself today.

196
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:41,680
I'm Marybeth Louise Hutchinson
of Atlanta. I'm new here.

197
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,560
- No shit.
- What's your name?

198
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,240
Why do you want
to know my name?

199
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:49,720
'Cause I don't have
any friends.

200
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:53,040
Correct me if I'm wrong, but you seem
to have one less than that.

201
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:57,160
- So I just thought--
- Stokely, are you seducing
the new students again?

202
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,080
Hi. I'm Delilah.

203
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:01,240
- Happy to have you at Herrington.
- Thank you.

204
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:05,200
Don't you love the way Stokely
accessorizes different shades
of black in her ensemble?

205
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,440
- Fuck you, gutter slut.
- I don't know why you insist...

206
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,720
on being such a bad example
for your people.

207
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,760
- What people?
- I hope you're not a violent
lesbian like your new friend.

208
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,800
Uh, no.

209
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:17,440
I'm not aware of any lesbianism
in my lineage.

210
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,320
That's too bad, Stokely. You'll just
have to keep looking for Miss Right.

211
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,160
Bipolar bitch.

212
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:25,080
Violent.

213
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,000
Yeah.

214
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:16,040
- What are you doing?
- I was just eating my lunch, sir.

215
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,080
This ain't the cafeteria, son.

216
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:22,280
Yes, sir.
I'm sorry about that, sir.

217
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:25,280
You're, uh--

218
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,960
- I forget your name.
- Casey.

219
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:33,000
Right.
I've seen you around.

220
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,000
You're not really
into sports.

221
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:38,840
I don't think a person should run
unless he's being chased.

222
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,960
"Being chased. "

223
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,040
I like that.

224
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,880
Get outta here.

225
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:14,320
- Mrs Brummel,
may I have a word with you?
- Certainly.

226
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,160
Man, get a fucking eye dog.

227
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:29,840
Maybe if you didn't paint
your fucking eyes shut.

228
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:37,520
- Mr Furlong.
- Present.

229
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,440
Found something
on the football field.

230
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,360
Thought you might want
to take a look.

231
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,400
- What is it?
- I was hoping you could tell me.

232
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,320
Want to be
lab partners?

233
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,160
I didn't know
you were a lesbian.

234
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,880
I don't think
I've ever met one before.

235
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,560
Have you been out long?

236
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,440
I think it's very impressive
and evolved of you--

237
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,960
I'm not a lesbian,
all right?

238
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:05,840
Be one. Please.
Fly free.

239
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,000
You were right about me. I don't have
any friends, and I like it that way.

240
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:13,800
- Being a lesbian is just my security.
- Your security against what?

241
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,640
People like you.

242
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,320
Complex.

243
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,160
Certain mesozoan...

244
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:26,880
only exist in the kidney
of certain squid and octopi.

245
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:33,120
- Which doesn't make sense because--
- This is Ohio.

246
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,760
Right.

247
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:38,600
It's a pelagic organism.

248
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:41,360
- What's pelagic?
- A sea-dwelling organism.

249
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,320
Exactly.

250
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:49,040
But I don't recognize
this surface tissue at all.

251
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,120
Casey, I don't want to blow
smoke up your butt, but I think
you found a new species.

252
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,680
Yeah, right.

253
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:57,360
It could happen. New species
are discovered every day.

254
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,680
- Don't be so cynical.
- Could it be gnathostomulida?

255
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:03,320
- No.
- They escaped detection
till the mid-20th century.

256
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,160
You just know
everything.

257
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:08,360
I'm a contradiction.

258
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,480
Check the mesodermic follicles
on its underbelly.

259
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:14,320
- What does that mean?
- It means we gotta call the university,

260
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:18,000
Iet them take a look, maybe get in
on some of that federal grant money.

261
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,720
Our secret...
all right?

262
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,920
- Hey, Stokely, maybe
it's from your planet.
- Blow me, blood fart.

263
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,720
Whoa.
Did you see that?

264
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,560
What is it doing?

265
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:42,320
- You think it's amphibian?
- Water resuscitated it.

266
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,240
Yeah,
but couldn't this kill it?

267
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,160
Yeah, you don't want
to drown it.

268
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,080
- One way to find out.
- Oh, man.

269
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,400
-
- It's all right.

270
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,520
It's okay.

271
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,200
Mr Furlong,
what are you doing?

272
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,120
I'm just gonna check
his prostate.

273
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,040
Actually,
the surface texture changed,

274
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,280
so... I want to feel it.

275
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:31,360
It can replicate.
Jesus.

276
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,720
Ah, fuck!

277
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:38,040
Goddamn it!

278
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:44,400
- I'm okay.
- It has teeth.

279
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:47,800
Where did it get teeth?

280
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:50,600
I'm gonna call the university.

281
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:05,480
I've just been
thinking ahead, Coach,

282
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,880
and, uh...

283
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:11,240
I've decided
to quit the team...

284
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:14,920
and concentrate
on my academics.

285
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:18,200
Okay.

286
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,960
Stan, we'll miss you.

287
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,160
That's it?

288
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,320
Well, what do you
want me to say?

289
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:28,680
My star quarterback comes to me the day
before we play Brun County,

290
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:31,400
the only team in the district
that can kick our ass,

291
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:34,440
and tells me
he doesn't want to play.

292
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,680
There's something up with that.

293
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:40,200
You seem to be going through
some life-defining turning point,

294
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:43,760
and I'm not gonna stand in the way
of the human condition.

295
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,520
You do what you have to do.

296
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:50,280
Thanks for not reaming me,
Coach.

297
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:53,680
What kind of human being
would I be if I did that?

298
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,240
Hey, give me that back.

299
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:13,800
Hey, yo, piss wad,
you're in my way.

300
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,720
I'm sorry.
I was breathing here.

301
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,000
Yeah, that's the problem.
You're occupying my air, you anal probe.

302
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,160
Hey.

303
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:27,520
Yo, Stan.
Tomorrow night, right?

304
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:30,240
That's right.
We'll kill them!

305
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,400
We draw blood! Yeah!

306
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:40,360
- It must really blow being you.
- You have no idea.

307
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,520
Yo, Casey, is that you?

308
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,440
- Mrs Brummel, what the fuck--
- Please.

309
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,600
Help me.
I can't breathe.

310
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,480
Get help!

311
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:46,520
You don't know what's happening.
They want everyone.

312
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,360
- It's okay.
-

313
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,280
Is Mrs Brummel
gonna be okay?

314
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:09,240
Stan, Mrs Brummel has been
diagnosed with cancer,

315
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:12,200
and she's on a lot
of medication at the moment.

316
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:15,080
It causes
disorientation.

317
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:19,880
We were hoping that she would
get through the school year,
but unfortunately it--

318
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:23,240
I hope you can understand
the sensitive nature of the situation.

319
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,480
Yeah.

320
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,200
Yeah,
I can keep it quiet.

321
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:33,360
Casey? You understand?

322
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,800
Casey, you understand?

323
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:41,360
- Casey?
- Yeah.

324
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,680
Sure.

325
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:54,920
- It's Neve Campbell?
- And Jennifer Love Hewitt, right?

326
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,320
Yep.
Party of prettiness.

327
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,920
- And they're naked?
- Full frontal.

328
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:14,400
Zeke, you cannot conduct
personal business on school property.

329
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:17,680
Well, Miss Burke,
we have a problem...

330
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,320
because I'm sitting on my car
and that's my property.

331
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:24,320
Well, um, I've had complaints
from several students...

332
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,720
that you've sold them
mind-altering substances.

333
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,200
You want to tell me about it
or take it up with Principal Drake?

334
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:33,440
You're too tense, Miss Burke,
but I've got just the thing for you.

335
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,880
You know, Zeke, I'm the authority figure
here. It's time you realized that.

336
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:38,480
"For gentle relief of blockage
caused by dietary stress. "

337
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,120
- Chocolate-flavoured laxatives.
- You know...

338
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:43,040
if you applied
just five percent...

339
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,160
- of that intellect to your studies,
- Not a chocolate lover, huh?

340
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,640
you could have made up
your finals last summer.

341
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:52,360
- You didn't have to
repeat your senior year.
- How about these?

342
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,120
Condoms.

343
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:57,880
Magnum-sized,
and they're cherry-flavoured.

344
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:02,480
Oh, come on, Miss Burke.
They're on me.

345
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:06,040
That's so rude.

346
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:18,000
I need a lead story.
I have no page one.

347
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:22,800
Well, we found a new phylum
in Biology. It's bizarre.

348
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,520
Really bizarre. Mr Furlong thinks
it might be a new species.

349
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:28,240
Ooh, let me race
to the stands for that issue.

350
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,480
- Why do you rag on me so much?
What did I do?
- Nothing.

351
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,560
It's just your fate.
You're that geeky Stephen King kid.

352
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,480
There's one of you
in every school.

353
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,560
- We can't go in here.
- Come on, Casey.

354
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,520
You're with me.
Be brave.

355
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:45,040
Okay, so what are
we looking for?

356
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,000
Anything.

357
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:57,320
Nurse Harper is medicated.
Big surprise.

358
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,240
Hey.

359
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:03,200
No, I exposed Mr Tate's alcoholism
last year. Nobody cares.

360
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:07,040
Well, his wife certainly didn't
when she ran off with the baby-sitter.

361
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,840
God.

362
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,080
- You can be such a...
- What?

363
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:18,480
pretty cool human being when you're
not being a first-class, grade-A bitch.

364
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,080
You hitting on me, Casey?

365
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:26,240
No. No.

366
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:29,040
I just think
you can be cool.

367
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,960
Sometimes.

368
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,920
This not being
one of them.

369
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:01,000
- Where's Brummel?
- She didn't make it.

370
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:03,600
Her body was too old.
The heat got to her.

371
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:07,400
Be careful of the climate.
It compromises your nervous system.

372
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,960
It makes one impulsive.

373
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:12,040
Has the entire faculty
been commuted?

374
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,920
Almost.

375
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:18,120
- What about the students?
- Soon.

376
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:20,600
-
-

377
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,000
What are you two
still doing here?

378
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:26,200
I thought I was
the only left.

379
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:32,960
There are not enough drugs
in this world.

380
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,360
What?

381
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,400
I have a pain.

382
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:08,160
Right here.

383
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:22,360
Get off of me! Jesus!

384
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,400
-
- Casey!

385
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,160
What the hell
is going on?

386
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:20,800
- Slow down there.
- Help us. They killed
Mrs Brummel. They're after us.

387
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,440
- What are you talking about?
- Coach Willis.
- And Mrs Olson.

388
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:26,920
- What's going on?
- Ask Nurse Harper, okay?
They attacked her.

389
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:29,160
Who attacked who?
What is going on?

390
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:32,160
I have no idea. I joined this right
in the middle of it.

391
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:35,080
Mrs Brummel wigged out
in the shower, and then we found
her body in the faculty closet.

392
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,840
What were you doing
in the faculty closet?

393
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,600
- Coach Willis and Mrs Olson
attacked Nurse Harper.
- Why would they do that?

394
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,400
There's Nurse Harper.
Just ask her.

395
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,720
Ah.

396
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,720
Now we can get
to the bottom of this.

397
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,120
- Oh, fuck.
- Delilah, run!

398
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,680
Delilah, wait!

399
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:23,080
In here?

400
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:26,080
Yes. The body
was in the closet.

401
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:30,800
- And why would Mrs Brummel
be in the closet?
- Because they killed her.

402
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,520
- Oh, that's right.
- Hey, Casey.

403
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:36,640
Sorry about that mix-up earlier.
Didn't mean to scare you.

404
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,960
Apparently, there's been
a misunderstanding.

405
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,120
Still, if we could just
see inside the closet.

406
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:43,200
Certainly.

407
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:57,200
- It's a doll.
- Meet Resuscitation Annie.

408
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:00,200
We use her to teach C. P. R.
to the students,

409
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:03,240
although I guess she does
resemble Mrs Brummel slightly.

410
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:06,320
- You dialled 911 for a dead doll?
- That wasn't there.

411
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:09,200
They put that there.
Look, I'm not making this up.

412
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:11,920
- You gotta call Delilah.
- We called her. She isn't home.

413
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:14,160
She was here with me.
She saw it too.

414
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,480
They attacked Nurse Harper.

415
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:20,560
- Nurse Harper is epileptic.
She's prone to grand mals.
- She had an attack.

416
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:23,880
Luckily, she carries
her medicine in her bag,
so we were able to help her.

417
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:27,600
We think it was brought on
by this terrible cold she's had.
I took her home myself.

418
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:31,240
- You can call her if you like.
- It is procedure.

419
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,360
You can use the phone
in my office.

420
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:40,920
That was some fast running
you did down the hall, son.

421
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:45,200
We could sure use your speed.

422
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:48,240
There's plenty of chasing
on the field.

423
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:51,720
Did you hear that, Casey?
He said you had speed.

424
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:55,360
- Thank you.
- Good luck in that game
tomorrow, Coach.

425
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:02,160
This way.

426
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,840
Cas,
what's gotten into you?

427
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,040
Evelyn knows someone downtown.
A professional.

428
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,840
- I'm gonna make an appointment.
-

429
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:23,720
He's a straight-A student,
and now he needs a professional?

430
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:28,120
- Christ.
- I don't need a shrink.
I know what I saw.

431
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:31,080
Well, we've just spoken...

432
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,920
with both Mrs Brummel
and Nurse Harper.

433
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:41,440
- They got him.
- There's nothing here.

434
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:44,680
Just some kid looking
for some attention. Let's go.

435
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,680
All right.

436
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,440
Well--

437
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:58,200
I am so sorry,
Miss Drake.

438
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:00,240
Maybe if you and I spoke privately,
we could come up with--

439
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,160
No. No, Mom.
Maybe you're right.

440
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:05,320
Maybe I should see
this woman, this doctor.

441
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:07,240
Can we just go?

442
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:11,280
We'll take care of this at home, Miss
Drake. Again, sorry for all the trouble.

443
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,200
I can see how it all
got out of hand.

444
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:17,120
It's a pretty bizarre
series of events.

445
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,560
It's our fault.
It won't happen again.

446
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:22,200
See you tomorrow, Casey.

447
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:31,040
Check his school books.

448
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:34,040
They hide the drugs in the spine
of the book. We saw it on Dateline.

449
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:37,000
- What are you on, son?
- I'm not on drugs.

450
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:39,520
That's government property, Dad.

451
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:41,440
Shit.

452
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:46,280
Look, we love you, son.
We want to help you.

453
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:50,440
Then believe me.
I'm telling the truth.

454
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:54,600
Something really weird
is happening at school. The teachers--

455
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,840
- Something's happened to them.
- Don't push it, all right?

456
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,080
- I'm bending as far as I can,
but if you push it--
- Just let me call Delilah.

457
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,760
Please?

458
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:05,160
Okay, that's it.

459
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,920
Your privileges
are now over.

460
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:11,440
No phone. Sorry. Over.
No internet.

461
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:16,680
You'll go to school, straight
to school, and you'll come
straight home. You got it?

462
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:20,360
I'm not going back to that school.
They're waiting for me.

463
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:24,240
Oh, you'll go. If I have to tie you
to the desk myself, you'll go.

464
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,320
No music.

465
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,920
His porno.

466
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:30,320
Porno.

467
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:37,120
Sorry, pal. No more
flogging the bishop.

468
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:40,800
We are gonna
get you help. Don't worry.

469
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:43,920
Get your room
cleaned up.

470
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:24,720
-
- What the hell do you
think you're doing?

471
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:27,040
Dad. They're here.

472
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:29,360
-
- The faculty.

473
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:34,200
Get in the house, now.

474
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,240
I'm losing it.

475
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:06,760
- Go on, son.
- Dad, I'm begging you.

476
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,880
Please.

477
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,920
Come home
right after school.

478
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:13,960
Your mom's
looking into a doctor.

479
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,480
Mr Connor.

480
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,680
Whoa! Delilah.
Wow, you look--

481
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:13,080
Don't. Come on.

482
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,000
Your attention, please.

483
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:17,040
Will the following students
report to the office:

484
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:20,360
James Archuleta,
Tina Dannhausen,

485
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:22,760
and Delilah Proffitt.

486
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,000
- This is all your fault.
- What do you mean?

487
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:27,000
Do you think I'm in drag
for the aesthetics?

488
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:28,920
They're after me.

489
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:31,120
- Did you tell your parents?
- My mom didn't believe me.

490
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,160
She drinks.
It was a nightmare.

491
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:35,080
- Look, we have to go to the police.
- No.

492
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,400
- They've got the police.
- We don't know what they've got.

493
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,960
Look, you saw it.
Mrs Brummel was dead.

494
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:42,200
- They attacked Nurse Harper.
- "They"? Who are "they"?

495
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:44,840
Casey, we don't even know
who "they" are.

496
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,760
Why did she act
like everything was okay?

497
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,680
It's a devil's cult
or something.

498
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:50,840
Maybe they worship comets.
Who the fuck knows?

499
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,760
I'm not gonna stay in a handicapped
bathroom for the rest of my life.

500
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:54,400
- They couldn't have gotten to everyone.
- Where are you going?

501
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:57,800
- I'm going to find Stan.
- Stan? Why Stan?

502
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:36,960
Will the following students
please report to the office:

503
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:40,560
Jennifer Qulick,
Randy Knotson and Thomas Nicks.

504
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:42,480
You should just
go talk to him.

505
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:45,240
No way.

506
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:49,000
I'm sorry.

507
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,960
So you-- Are you ready
for the big game?

508
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:57,040
I quit the team.

509
00:41:57,160 --> 00:42:00,960
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

510
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:02,880
Why?

511
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:11,120
Just tired of everyone kissing my ass
'cause I'm captain of the football team.

512
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:16,640
You know... the coach, the students,
even the teachers.

513
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,120
Last year after we won
the 2A Conference--

514
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,400
That was thanks to you
and your completed passes.

515
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:24,480
You follow the games?

516
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:28,000
I wouldn't
have guessed that.

517
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:30,280
I made a "D" on a biology test
right after,

518
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:33,920
and Mr Furlong
changed it to an "A. "

519
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:37,000
He said I deserved
for having such a strong arm.

520
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:40,040
That really bugged me,
you know?

521
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:44,280
I worked hard for that "D. "
That was my "D. " I deserved that "D. "

522
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:49,440
I just wish people
would let me be, you know--

523
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,360
A "D" student.

524
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:54,160
Yeah.

525
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:05,160
Okay, class, listen up.

526
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:08,840
Today we are going to write
a living family history.

527
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,440
Everyone take out a piece of paper
and write down the name...

528
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:14,440
of every living member
of your family.

529
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:17,960
Begin with your immediate family--
those living with you--

530
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:21,280
then include the names
of your nearest living relatives.

531
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,920
What?

532
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:28,360
- Is this gonna be on the test?
- This is the test.

533
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:34,880
What is that?

534
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:39,800
It's magic dust.

535
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:43,480
- You want some?
- No, I have a low tolerance,
but thank you.

536
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:46,360
- You sure?
- I'm allergic to aspirin,

537
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:49,120
so that would
probably kill me.

538
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:52,720
- We wouldn't want to do that.
- No.

539
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:56,320
I'm Marybeth Louise Hutchinson
of Atlanta.

540
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:58,760
Atlanta.
I know.

541
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:01,080
That's right.
You know everything.

542
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:03,080
I'm Zeke.

543
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:05,720
- I know.
- It's a pleasure.

544
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:07,960
The pleasure's
all mine.

545
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:13,560
There's a mandatory meeting
in the office at lunch today
for all club presidents.

546
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:16,280
Remember, tonight we take on
the Brun County Changa.

547
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:19,440
- Please come at 5:30
and show your support.
- Hey, that's mine.

548
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:23,480
Weird,
isn't it?

549
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:27,040
- What do you think it is?
- Locker search maybe?

550
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:29,840
Something weird
is going on here.

551
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:44,560
Hey, Football.

552
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:47,120
Hey, Gabe.

553
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:50,480
- You're not pissed, are you?
- About what?

554
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:52,200
I'm the new team captain.

555
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:01,640
What's going on here?

556
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:05,680
Nurse Harper, she's giving an ear exam
or some shit like that.

557
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:07,680
And that takes the police?

558
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:11,600
Stan, I need
to talk to you.

559
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:13,520
I didn't know
you wore glasses.

560
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:16,000
Contacts.
Come on, it's important.

561
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,880
Stokely, got a second?
I need your help.

562
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:29,800
So after the accident, I came here
to live with relatives, you know.

563
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:35,400
So I moved in
with my cousins and... here I am.

564
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:39,560
Fucking do something,
you pussy puke!

565
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:41,480
Yeah, my mom and dad
are dead too.

566
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:44,200
- Really?
- Yeah.

567
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:47,360
They're still breathing,
but for all intents and purposes,

568
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:49,440
they're very much dead.

569
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:54,360
You've fucking gone weird.
Fuck you, you pussy.

570
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:57,560
- Fuck you!
- You and I have a lot in common then.

571
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,400
Yeah.

572
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:07,480
- You notice anything off
today here at school?
- I'm from the south.

573
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:10,080
- Y'all are off.
- Dude, we need some scat.

574
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:12,160
Yeah, man, we can't deal.
There's some weird shit going down here.

575
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:16,480
Five bucks a pop. Hey, man,
how's the new you working out?

576
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:19,440
Working out just fine.

577
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:21,520
Hey, you got any more?

578
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:23,520
- Sure, man.
- Really?

579
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:27,400
Why don't you give us
all you got?

580
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:29,840
All right.
Dough.

581
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:34,200
- You got any more?
- Not on me, man.

582
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:38,080
- What about in your locker?
- How about in your car?
Got any more there?

583
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:43,760
- Use in moderation, boys.
- Come on, Zeke. Hook us up.

584
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:47,000
Check out
Miss Burke. Wow, what happened to her?

585
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:52,480
Oh, man, I'm really not in the mood,
Miss Burke. I'm clean.

586
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:55,600
- What's up with her?
- Not today.

587
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:58,440
It's too damn hot, and I got
zero-fucking-tolerance.

588
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:04,040
Eat me, you asshole. I'm the one with
no tolerance, you pathetic little runt.

589
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:06,960
Ouch. Comeback.

590
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:08,960
What are you gonna do?
Are you gonna call my mother?

591
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:11,600
And how am I supposed to do
that, little Zekey boy?

592
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:13,680
Do you even know
where she is?

593
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:18,600
Europe, Sri Lanka, Japan? I wonder what
remote location she went to this week...

594
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:22,840
to hide from her
great big bastard mistake.

595
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
I've taken your shit
for too fucking long,

596
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:27,840
you dickless drug-induced
excuse for a human being.

597
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,840
- Whoa. Woman, what are you on?
- "Woman"? Did you just say, "woman"?

598
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,160
I'm sick of you,
little boy.

599
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:36,680
And if I see you peddling
your wonder dust again,

600
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:40,160
I'm gonna shove my foot
so far up your ass...

601
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:42,480
you'll be sucking my toes
till graduation.

602
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:48,080
Big trouble. Oh, wow.

603
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,960
She got some bad shit.

604
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:56,280
And then they chased us,
but we got away.

605
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:58,760
All this started when Mrs Brummel
did a wet and wild...

606
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:01,360
- in the boys' locker room?
- I think so.

607
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:06,440
Everybody's been acting really strange,
especially the faculty.

608
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:09,360
Tell me about it. It's like they've
all turned into fucking pod people...

609
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:10,800
- or something.
- Into what people?

610
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:16,320
Invasion of the Body Snatchers.
A small town was taken over by aliens.

611
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:17,800
That was a joke.

612
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:20,200
Look, what if it
really happened?

613
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:24,000
- What if that really happened?
- I think something's
taking over our school.

614
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:26,720
The Body Snatchers is a story
somebody made up, dingus.

615
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:28,640
It's located in the fiction
section of the library.

616
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:32,520
So is Schindler's List. All fiction
is based on some truth, right?

617
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:35,120
What does Miss Burke teach us
in English 101? Write what you know.

618
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:37,040
How do we know
this writer guy...

619
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:38,800
- Jack Finney.
- didn't encounter aliens
in his high school...

620
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:41,840
which led him to write a book
about an alien invasion?

621
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,080
- Your conspiracy theory is flawed.
- How so?

622
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:46,600
Jack Finney's The Body Snatchers
is a blatant rip-off...

623
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:48,520
of The Puppet Masters
by Robert Heinlein.

624
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:50,760
So you can completely disregard
that entire work.

625
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:52,760
Whatever.
The point is they're here,

626
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:54,680
they've been here
and they're here again.

627
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:57,440
You know, Casey, I think you've
been racked into the flagpole
one too many times.

628
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:59,080
Look, how do you know
there's not a conspiracy?

629
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:01,080
Maybe X-Files is right.

630
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:03,720
Where do all these movies
come from anyway?

631
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:06,240
How do we know Spielberg,
Lucas, Sonnenfeld,

632
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:09,000
Emmerich haven't been
visited by aliens?

633
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:10,920
You know, maybe they're
aliens themselves.

634
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:13,280
Maybe they're simply preparing us
for what's to come.

635
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:15,360
You know what, Casey,
it's fiction. Okay?

636
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:17,400
- It's science fiction.
- Exactly.

637
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:20,320
Everybody gets hung up on the science
part, which has nothing to do with it.

638
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:22,440
They're getting at us
through the fiction.

639
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:25,200
So, aliens have just been
setting us up over the years,

640
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:27,200
creating this happy little
make-believe existence...

641
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:29,120
with their E. T.
and their Men ln Black movies...

642
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:31,680
just so that nobody would believe it
if it really happened?

643
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:34,800
I think so.
Yeah.

644
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:39,720
- You're not buying this, are you?
- No, I'm not.

645
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:43,240
But it's kind of cool.

646
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:45,080
Okay, so what's missing?

647
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:48,640
Well, in The Body Snatchers,
they were pods, but where are they?

648
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:50,560
I mean, where are the pods?

649
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:52,880
There are no pods.

650
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:55,800
There's gotta be
something else.

651
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:59,480
In Puppet Masters,
they were parasites.

652
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:08,520
- I filled Stan in.
- Come with us. Stokely's
onto something.

653
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:10,400
Really?

654
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:14,040
Shit.

655
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:18,680
Furlong must have sent it
up to the university.

656
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:21,800
- Doubtful.
- Where else could it be?

657
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:24,720
-
- What? What is it?

658
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:29,600
Will someone please tell me
what the hell's going on here?

659
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:34,080
It all started yesterday when
I found this thing, this new species.

660
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:36,040
Which is now missing.

661
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:43,080
We think aliens are
taking over our school.

662
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:48,360
Right. Come on.

663
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:49,800
You saw what Brummel
did in the shower.

664
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:52,520
I saw her dead body
in the closet.

665
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:56,200
They've been calling students
into the office. The students
with the most influence on down,

666
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:58,440
including the new team captain.

667
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:00,360
Looks like you picked
the right week to quit football.

668
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:02,280
You think aliens have
infested our school?

669
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:07,040
That would explain their weird
behaviour, wouldn't it?

670
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:09,160
Give me a fucking break.

671
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:21,240
So, what are we
doing in here?

672
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:24,400
Shopping.

673
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:28,640
- I've got a very large grocery list.
- What are you talking about?

674
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:30,720
This is where
I get my equipment.

675
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:32,800
You borrow it
from science labs?

676
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:35,280
I like to think of it
as stealing, actually.

677
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:40,720
-
- Just doing my part to
the deconstruction of America.

678
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:48,240
So if anybody
finds us in here,

679
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:50,320
just grab ahold of me and pretend
we're making out.

680
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:52,920
The punishment
will be less severe.

681
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:10,440
- Aliens?
- Do you have
a better explanation, Stan?

682
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:14,800
Great. Just listen
to yourselves. Our teachers are aliens?

683
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:17,720
- Shh.
- That's not weird,
that's fucking psychotic.

684
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:20,040
Come on, guys.
Uh-- This is nuts.

685
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:22,440
Then leave, Stan. Why are you
hanging around? Go win a Pulitzer.

686
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:24,600
Blow me, Delilah,
'cause I'm sick of your shit.

687
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:27,640
- Get the fuck out of here and
take your freak dyke with you.
- Fuck you, tit bags.

688
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:30,880
- Will everybody calm down, please?
- All right, Casey.

689
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:35,760
Let's go alien for a second.
Why here?

690
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:37,840
Why Ohio?

691
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,920
If you were going
to take over the world,

692
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:42,440
would you blow up the White House
lndependence Day style...

693
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:45,760
or sneak in
through the backdoor?

694
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:53,560
-
-

695
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:57,360
Casey.

696
00:52:57,520 --> 00:53:01,560
Man, the only person
in this school who is an alien...

697
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:03,520
is you, man.

698
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:07,440
- Fuck you, Zeke.
- Oh.

699
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:09,400
What's going on here?

700
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:13,960
Shouldn't you people
be in class?

701
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:17,320
Well, it's like this,
Mr Furlong,

702
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:21,040
Casey here
thinks you're an alien.

703
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:28,600
- Really?
- The whole faculty, actually.

704
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:31,880
Is that true?

705
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:37,160
Casey?

706
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:42,120
The, uh, thing I found yesterday--
Where is it?

707
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:44,360
I sent it to the university.

708
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:47,160
Do they know what it is?

709
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:53,960
Look, sorry to impose and
disrupt, Mr Furlong, but--

710
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:56,960
If you'd kindly take your seats,
this will be over quite quickly.

711
00:53:57,120 --> 00:53:59,160
Now sit down!

712
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:11,880
- Put him the fuck down, Furlong.
- This is for the best, Zeke.

713
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:17,680
Goddamn it!

714
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:19,680
Come on.

715
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:22,080
No!

716
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:28,240
-
-

717
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:10,160
-
- Zeke.

718
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:25,600
This is usually the point where somebody
says, "Let's get the fuck outta here. "

719
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:27,760
Let's get the fuck outta here.

720
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:35,000
Aliens are taking over
the fucking school.

721
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:39,960
We gotta have proof.

722
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:43,280
All right, everybody,
here's the deal.

723
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:45,520
We're heading straight
for the parking lot.

724
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:48,520
Pull it together,
and try to stay calm.

725
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:23,480
Stokely.

726
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:29,880
What's Stan
hanging out with those guys for?

727
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:40,680
Delilah.

728
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:57,800
My car.

729
00:56:57,960 --> 00:57:01,080
- Where are we going?
- Anywhere but here.

730
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:03,200
Wait.
Stan!

731
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:06,080
- There he is. Let's go.
- Where you going, buddy?

732
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:08,480
- We're going to, uh--
- Come on, Stan. Jesus Christ.

733
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:10,760
- Get in the fucking car.
- Sure you don't want to play with us?

734
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:13,720
Nah, Gabe... but thanks.

735
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:27,760
What the fuck is going on?

736
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:29,920
Let's see if anybody's talking.|

737
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:39,000
-
- Who the fuck are these guys?

738
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:41,280
All right,
pull over here, fellas.

739
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:45,320
- Fuck this shit.
- Hey!

740
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:16,480
- Where's your mom and dad?
- Europe, I think.

741
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:24,760
Oh, shit.

742
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:28,480
- Oh, my God.
- This is some serious shit.

743
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:39,800
This is your big secret?
Caffeine pills?

744
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:42,000
You didn't see that.

745
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:45,360
What are we gonna do with
the police not being an option?

746
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:47,680
I can call my dad.
He'd know what to do.

747
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:49,800
If he's even
your dad anymore.

748
00:58:55,480 --> 00:58:57,440
It's called a gun, man.

749
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:09,920
What is it?

750
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:13,800
We're gonna find out.

751
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:17,440
Hey, come here, Oscar.

752
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:19,840
Come here, buddy.

753
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:38,120
Jeez.

754
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:53,200
Now what?

755
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:55,440
I'm sorry, buddy.

756
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:20,720
See? It's a parasite.

757
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:24,840
It attaches itself to a host,
and then it controls it.

758
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:33,680
- It's incomplete.
- What do you mean?

759
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:36,720
It can survive on its own, but it's
really part of a greater organism.

760
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:40,240
Look, it has the ability to replicate,
but it needs a host.

761
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:42,200
Something moist.

762
01:00:42,360 --> 01:00:45,080
See what it did to Oscar's insides.
It dried them out.

763
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:47,800
Hey, isn't a human body
composed mainly of water?

764
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:48,960
They're using us.

765
01:00:49,120 --> 01:00:51,120
- Drying us out.
- Like Mrs Brummel, right?

766
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:52,880
I overheard the coach.

767
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:54,800
Her body was too old.
She didn't take.

768
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:56,800
See, this partially explains
what happened to Furlong.

769
01:01:01,840 --> 01:01:06,320
That drug's a diuretic.
Dries it out. Kills it.

770
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:09,080
They're using us as hosts. They're just
turning us into mindless slaves...

771
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:12,200
- they can control.
- How do you know that?

772
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:15,000
She doesn't.
She's a Trekkie sci-fi freak.

773
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:17,480
Who's been right so far.

774
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:19,520
How do we stop it?

775
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:22,680
Yeah, Stokely,
this is your area.

776
01:01:24,840 --> 01:01:27,200
In theory,
they're all connected.

777
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:30,280
- If we kill the master,
we get them all.
- "ln theory. "

778
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:32,360
What happens to everybody else?

779
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:34,920
The ones who've been taken over?
Do they just die?

780
01:01:35,080 --> 01:01:37,680
No, they don't.
They would become human again.

781
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:40,320
But that is
in theory, so--

782
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:42,680
So if we found the leader
and killed it,

783
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:45,400
- we'd beat it.
- What are we even talking about?

784
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:47,560
- I say we get the fuck out of town.
- And go where?

785
01:01:47,720 --> 01:01:51,000
Don't you see? We got to stop it
or it's gonna spread.

786
01:01:51,160 --> 01:01:53,280
It took the high school
in a day and a half.

787
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:56,640
Give it a week,
we'll never outrun it.

788
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:59,240
- We have to fight.
- Fight what?

789
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:02,040
We don't even know
who's alien and who's not.

790
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:04,640
What if one of us was an alien
right now? How would we know?

791
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:07,800
He's right. How do I know
you're really Casey?

792
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:09,600
How do I know
you're really you?

793
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:12,720
In Body Snatchers,
humans became emotionless.

794
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:15,880
- They completely lost their identities.
- The coach had emotion.

795
01:02:16,040 --> 01:02:18,840
I mean, he's usually a real hard-ass,
but he was different somehow.

796
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,160
His behaviour
was slightly odd.

797
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:24,120
Like a star quarterback who mysteriously
quits the football team?

798
01:02:24,280 --> 01:02:26,040
What are you doing, Delilah?

799
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:27,960
I'm just pointing out
your "slightly odd" behaviour, Stan.

800
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:30,560
You've been acting really weird
the last couple of days.

801
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:33,720
I'm not an alien,
I'm discontent.

802
01:02:33,880 --> 01:02:36,920
- There's another big word.
- You want to talk slightly odd?

803
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:38,920
What about you? You haven't been
without your contacts...

804
01:02:39,080 --> 01:02:40,760
or hair spray
since birth.

805
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:44,320
- I'm incognito.
- We just have to trust each other.

806
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:48,360
And I'm supposed to trust you?
Tell me something, Miss Lesbian,
when did you start liking boys?

807
01:02:48,520 --> 01:02:51,360
- What the fuck you talking about?
- I see the way you look at Stan.

808
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:54,560
So when did you stop
muff-diving?

809
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:56,120
She's not a lesbian.
That was a hoax.

810
01:02:56,280 --> 01:02:58,240
- Really?
- Yeah.

811
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:00,960
And what about you,
Miss Atlanta?

812
01:03:01,080 --> 01:03:04,520
It's just really convenient that
you showed up the second all
these things started happening.

813
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:08,600
- What are you doing in Ohio anyway?
- It's not my fault.

814
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:10,920
Hey, shut up.

815
01:03:11,080 --> 01:03:13,000
She's got a point, Zeke.

816
01:03:14,120 --> 01:03:16,720
Yeah, Zeke, Professor.

817
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:19,960
I mean, you seem to know an awful lot
about this stuff.

818
01:03:20,120 --> 01:03:24,040
No offence, but you're not exactly known
for your academic achievements.

819
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:26,520
Neither are you, man.

820
01:03:26,680 --> 01:03:30,600
- Casey, when did you
become Sigourney Weaver?
- Wha--

821
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:32,880
All right,
this is getting us nowhere.

822
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:48,280
I got a solution.

823
01:03:48,440 --> 01:03:52,600
We know this outs them, right?
Take a hit.

824
01:03:52,760 --> 01:03:56,200
No way, man.
I don't do drugs.

825
01:03:56,360 --> 01:03:59,960
Aw, come on, man. If you're not an
alien, you got nothing to worry about.

826
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:02,360
Zeke's right.

827
01:04:02,520 --> 01:04:05,280
This is the only way
to know for sure.

828
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:07,680
Yeah, come on, Stan.
What are you afraid of, man?

829
01:04:07,840 --> 01:04:10,040
Look, we all do it.

830
01:04:14,840 --> 01:04:17,880
- Casey.
- Why me first?

831
01:04:18,040 --> 01:04:19,720
It's your birthright, man.
Just fucking take it.

832
01:04:32,760 --> 01:04:34,800
-
- Easy, boy.

833
01:04:41,720 --> 01:04:45,200
What about you, Zeke? How do we know
you're not one of those fucking things?

834
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:50,240
I don't get high
on my own stash, man.

835
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:52,120
Fuck that, man!
You're taking it.

836
01:04:52,280 --> 01:04:55,160
You're taking it.

837
01:04:58,840 --> 01:05:01,160
-
- Now what the hell's wrong with him?

838
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:03,160
-
- Nothing's wrong
with him, you asshole.

839
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:05,000
He's tweaking.
Let him fucking tweak!

840
01:05:07,160 --> 01:05:09,400
Tweak. Tweak.

841
01:05:09,560 --> 01:05:11,520
Now you.

842
01:05:26,440 --> 01:05:28,800
Your turn.|

843
01:05:50,360 --> 01:05:52,280
Stokely.

844
01:05:53,720 --> 01:05:56,280
I'm not putting that hack drug
up my nose.

845
01:05:56,440 --> 01:06:00,760
- It's so '80s.
- Aliens are taking over
the Earth. Weigh it.

846
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:06,840
- What's in it?
- Mostly caffeine.
Some other household shit.

847
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:15,640
Oh, shit.

848
01:06:19,160 --> 01:06:21,520
Now you,
Delilah.

849
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:27,680
- No. Her first.
-

850
01:06:27,840 --> 01:06:30,760
- I'm allergic.
- Yeah, and I'm Portuguese. Who cares?

851
01:06:34,360 --> 01:06:36,560
Is she always this much fun, man?

852
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:39,640
Sometimes she can be a real bitch.

853
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:45,800
You know what I'm saying? You know?

854
01:06:51,080 --> 01:06:53,320
You both take it.|

855
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:56,120
Zeke, I can't.
You know, I can't.

856
01:06:59,080 --> 01:07:00,840
You have to take it.

857
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:12,200
Showdown.|

858
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:31,640
Del?

859
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:39,560
Oh, shit!

860
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:51,840
Shoot her. Shoot her
in the head, Casey.

861
01:07:51,960 --> 01:07:54,440
- Stan, I don't know what's happening.
- Shoot her, Casey.

862
01:07:54,600 --> 01:07:58,200
- Don't shoot her, Casey.
- Shoot her, Casey. She's
fucking one of them, man!

863
01:07:58,360 --> 01:08:01,120
There's nowhere to go.

864
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:02,520
Nowhere to hide.
We're everywhere.

865
01:08:02,680 --> 01:08:05,040
I'll fucking shoot her.|

866
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:08,400
Ah, shit!

867
01:08:14,120 --> 01:08:15,600
Jesus!

868
01:08:19,640 --> 01:08:21,440
Get her!

869
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:24,000
-
- She's getting away!

870
01:08:24,160 --> 01:08:27,240
- Hurry!
- Aw, shit!

871
01:08:33,360 --> 01:08:36,440
I should have known that
crazy bitch was one of them.

872
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:38,400
We can get her back, Zeke.

873
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:40,440
We can get them all back.

874
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:44,200
She destroyed
most of my supply.

875
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:49,640
Look, if we kill the queen,
we can get them all back.

876
01:08:53,400 --> 01:08:55,240
Fuck!

877
01:09:02,360 --> 01:09:05,600
- How much do we have left?
- Not much.

878
01:09:05,760 --> 01:09:07,640
But we only need enough
to get the queen.

879
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:10,480
- We get her, we get them all, right?
- I think so.

880
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:15,320
- Where are we gonna find her?
- Friday night?
Only one place she can be.

881
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:36,680
He crosses the field!
Eludes the tacklers!

882
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:39,960
Tackled by four Hornets
with authority.

883
01:09:45,400 --> 01:09:50,200
Oh, somebody stung
by the Hornets!

884
01:09:56,600 --> 01:10:00,440
Come on, ladies!
Let's play four quarters!

885
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:01,800
-
- Jesus.

886
01:10:09,720 --> 01:10:11,320
Get in there
and take his fucking head off.

887
01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:16,560
Kill! Kill!

888
01:10:26,920 --> 01:10:29,080
Kill!

889
01:10:38,040 --> 01:10:40,040
- You think it's Principal Drake?
- Who else?

890
01:10:40,200 --> 01:10:42,880
She's in charge.
It would make perfect sense.

891
01:10:45,080 --> 01:10:49,240
They're getting everybody.
I mean, the whole town is here.

892
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:53,160
By morning, there won't be
a human left.

893
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:07,920
Come on.

894
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:28,520
Where are you guys?

895
01:11:28,720 --> 01:11:31,440
We found Drake.
She's at the game.

896
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:33,520
What are you kids
doing in here?

897
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:42,080
The gym is closed.
All of you come with me.

898
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:45,760
We can't do that,
Miss Drake.

899
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:50,600
Why is that?|

900
01:11:50,760 --> 01:11:53,120
-
- Get her.

901
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:55,320
- Quick, Zeke, get the doors!
-

902
01:11:57,400 --> 01:12:00,520
Get me out!
You're all expelled!

903
01:12:00,680 --> 01:12:03,960
- Stop the act. No one's buying it.
- We know who you are.

904
01:12:05,400 --> 01:12:08,520
You're in a lot of trouble.

905
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:11,640
What are you doing?

906
01:12:13,880 --> 01:12:16,720
- You ready?
- Yep.

907
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:20,840
Sniff this.

908
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:24,320
- No.
- Sniff it or he shoots you.

909
01:12:24,440 --> 01:12:27,400
I will not.

910
01:12:27,560 --> 01:12:29,360
Now what?

911
01:12:36,160 --> 01:12:37,920
We do it the hard way.

912
01:12:38,080 --> 01:12:41,800
With Mr Furlong, we plunged it into his
eye, and the reaction was instantaneous.

913
01:12:41,960 --> 01:12:44,640
You stick her, and then I'll shoot her
before it erupts all over the place.

914
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:46,360
Casey, are you on drugs?

915
01:12:49,640 --> 01:12:52,440
- What's wrong?
- Are we sure?

916
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:54,560
Please don't, Casey!

917
01:12:54,720 --> 01:12:56,600
Don't wuss out, Casey!
Just do it!

918
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:12,720
What if we were wrong?

919
01:13:14,760 --> 01:13:17,120
Stab it
and find out.

920
01:13:28,040 --> 01:13:30,760
I think we made a mistake, guys.

921
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:34,480
She's dead.|

922
01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:43,200
- Easy!
-

923
01:13:48,240 --> 01:13:50,000
Is that it?

924
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,320
Let's see if it worked.

925
01:14:20,600 --> 01:14:22,360
It better have worked,

926
01:14:22,520 --> 01:14:25,000
or there are gonna be
a lot of infected people going home.

927
01:14:25,160 --> 01:14:28,080
We're right at ground zero.

928
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:34,160
You guys stay here.
I'll go check it out.

929
01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:38,560
I'm gonna need some scat.

930
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:42,000
Use it wisely, man.

931
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:50,640
- What if it wasn't Drake?
-

932
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:52,560
Then we're fucked.

933
01:15:06,360 --> 01:15:08,440
I just don't want
to never have done that.

934
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:22,800
What are you looking at?

935
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:35,280
Coach.

936
01:15:53,160 --> 01:15:55,600
Jesus, I wish I'd never come here.
I don't like this place.

937
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:58,000
Any sign of him?

938
01:16:00,440 --> 01:16:02,960
I can't tell.
I can barely see anything.

939
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:05,680
Quick, Stokely,
open the door.

940
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:07,720
No, Stokely! We don't know
if it's still him.

941
01:16:07,880 --> 01:16:09,800
No, it's me.
Listen, it wasn't Drake.

942
01:16:09,960 --> 01:16:12,080
It's the coach,
and he's right after me. Open the door.

943
01:16:12,240 --> 01:16:14,520
Don't do it, Stoke.
Prove it, Stan. Where's the drug?

944
01:16:14,680 --> 01:16:18,400
I lost it. The coach was too
fast for me. Please, Stokely,
don't leave me out here.

945
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:22,440
- Last one, man.
- Please, I'm begging you!
Don't leave me out here!

946
01:16:22,600 --> 01:16:24,960
- Come on, Stokely. Open the door.
- There, try it.

947
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:27,080
Okay, I'll do it. I'll--
Just let me do it inside.

948
01:16:27,240 --> 01:16:29,280
Do it right now, man.

949
01:16:29,400 --> 01:16:31,520
- Take the test, man.
- Stan, take the drug, man.
Prove it to us.

950
01:16:31,680 --> 01:16:33,560
Okay.

951
01:16:45,440 --> 01:16:46,840
Fuck!

952
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:50,920
Fuck!

953
01:16:51,080 --> 01:16:53,440
Open the door.

954
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:56,760
It is so much better.

955
01:16:56,920 --> 01:16:59,240
There's no fear...
or pain.

956
01:16:59,360 --> 01:17:01,680
It's beautiful.

957
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:05,240
And you will be beautiful.

958
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:07,080
You'll be beautiful.

959
01:17:07,240 --> 01:17:10,640
No problems or worries.

960
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:13,840
We want you.

961
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,160
I want you.

962
01:17:16,320 --> 01:17:18,880
I want you.

963
01:17:19,040 --> 01:17:21,000
Now open the fucking door!

964
01:17:21,160 --> 01:17:22,920
- Open the door!
- Come away.

965
01:17:23,080 --> 01:17:25,800
- Go a-fucking-way, Stan!
-

966
01:17:25,960 --> 01:17:29,600
It's too late, Stokely.
We've already won.

967
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:31,600
No pain, Stan?

968
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:34,640
Well, come in here,
and I'll show you some fucking pain!

969
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:51,280
I say we go for the coach.

970
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:53,520
He turned Stan.
He's the one.

971
01:17:55,320 --> 01:17:57,440
Would you rather wait
for them to come to us?

972
01:17:57,600 --> 01:18:00,280
Either way,
we're completely unarmed.

973
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:02,560
Maybe not. I might
have some more scat.

974
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:04,160
Where?

975
01:18:04,320 --> 01:18:07,520
- In my trunk.
- ln your trunk.

976
01:18:07,680 --> 01:18:12,320
In your car, amongst the aliens.
Oh, that's convenient.

977
01:18:12,440 --> 01:18:15,360
You got a better idea?

978
01:18:17,400 --> 01:18:19,240
Stan?

979
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:23,160
You out there, buddy?

980
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,800
-
- Does it really take two of us
to get to your car?

981
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:59,480
Nope. One of us
is a decoy.

982
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:05,040
Get him!

983
01:19:07,680 --> 01:19:10,320
Where did he go?

984
01:19:10,440 --> 01:19:13,480
- Check over there.
- Come on! Find him!

985
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:20,360
- Hello, Casey.
-

986
01:19:21,400 --> 01:19:23,200
Where are you gonna go,
huh?

987
01:19:23,320 --> 01:19:26,400
Class wuss.
Eternal little loser...

988
01:19:26,560 --> 01:19:30,720
who comes to school every day
knowing that this is it.

989
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:32,720
You've been
labelled pathetic...

990
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:36,080
since first grade, and you're
afraid it's gonna bleed over
for the rest of your life.

991
01:19:36,240 --> 01:19:38,000
But we can stop it, Casey.

992
01:19:38,160 --> 01:19:40,320
We can help you belong.
Isn't that what you really want?

993
01:19:40,440 --> 01:19:42,000
Please don't do this,
Delilah.

994
01:19:42,160 --> 01:19:45,160
I haven't been this happy
since probably--

995
01:19:45,320 --> 01:19:47,360
since before my dad died.

996
01:19:49,040 --> 01:19:50,640
You know you want me, Casey.

997
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:53,720
Come on.
Let's do it together.

998
01:20:02,400 --> 01:20:05,600
-
-

999
01:20:22,440 --> 01:20:25,200
Hello, Miss Burke.|

1000
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:27,120
Hello, sweetie pie.

1001
01:20:29,240 --> 01:20:32,720
- What are you looking for?
- Nothing important.

1002
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:36,080
So, I take it you changed your mind
about the chocolate laxatives?

1003
01:20:36,240 --> 01:20:41,040
Actually, I had my heart set
on something cherry-flavoured.
You know what I mean?

1004
01:20:41,200 --> 01:20:43,600
Sorry, I'm all out of those.

1005
01:20:47,280 --> 01:20:50,120
I might have something else
for you though.

1006
01:20:50,280 --> 01:20:52,320
- Yeah?
- Oh, yeah.

1007
01:20:52,440 --> 01:20:56,800
- Something tasty?
- Let me hook you up.

1008
01:21:06,640 --> 01:21:08,560
Hello, Zekey boy.

1009
01:21:08,720 --> 01:21:10,400
-
-

1010
01:21:15,760 --> 01:21:19,840
You're too tense, honey.
Relax.

1011
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:27,200
Fuck this.
I'm outta here.

1012
01:22:36,680 --> 01:22:40,120
I always thought the only
alien in this high school was me.

1013
01:22:43,200 --> 01:22:47,520
Not the case.

1014
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:53,520
Who do you think it is,
the master alien, the queen bee?

1015
01:22:53,680 --> 01:22:57,360
It could be anyone.

1016
01:22:57,520 --> 01:22:59,320
What happens at the end
of these stories, Stokely?

1017
01:22:59,440 --> 01:23:02,720
How does lnvasion of the
Body Snatchers turn out?

1018
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:06,720
They get us.
They win. We lose.

1019
01:23:09,120 --> 01:23:13,400
Do we?
Maybe we really win.

1020
01:23:13,560 --> 01:23:15,560
Stan didn't
look unhappy.

1021
01:23:15,720 --> 01:23:18,080
That's 'cause
it wasn't Stan.

1022
01:23:18,240 --> 01:23:20,040
They took away
who he was.

1023
01:23:22,680 --> 01:23:25,800
Maybe they just bettered
who he was,

1024
01:23:25,960 --> 01:23:29,280
cleared away
his confusion.

1025
01:23:32,560 --> 01:23:38,160
I know you pride yourself
on being the outsider, Stokely,

1026
01:23:38,320 --> 01:23:42,440
but aren't you tired
of being something you're not?

1027
01:23:46,760 --> 01:23:48,760
I know I am.

1028
01:24:02,200 --> 01:24:03,880
No fucking way!

1029
01:24:21,520 --> 01:24:24,000
Oh, shit!

1030
01:24:28,880 --> 01:24:31,280
Run, Stokes!|

1031
01:24:35,440 --> 01:24:37,120
Stokes!

1032
01:24:47,280 --> 01:24:49,880
Stokely!

1033
01:24:50,040 --> 01:24:54,560
Stokes! Stokes!

1034
01:24:58,520 --> 01:25:01,080
Stokely!

1035
01:25:02,960 --> 01:25:05,640
No!

1036
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:08,200
Stokely!

1037
01:25:15,120 --> 01:25:18,640
Come on, Stokes.
Run!

1038
01:25:20,280 --> 01:25:21,160
Come on!

1039
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:13,440
- Hello?
- Zeke, I'm over here.

1040
01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:16,040
Watch out.
It's her.

1041
01:26:16,200 --> 01:26:20,440
- Zeke, don't believe her. It's her.
- She attacked me. Please, Zeke.

1042
01:26:20,600 --> 01:26:22,720
- What's going on here, Marybeth?
- Please, it is her.

1043
01:26:22,880 --> 01:26:24,640
She's lying.
She's trying to fake you out.

1044
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:30,000
We don't know what she is:
gay, straight, alien.

1045
01:26:31,320 --> 01:26:34,160
Answer me something,
Marybeth:

1046
01:26:34,320 --> 01:26:36,440
Why are you naked?

1047
01:26:38,840 --> 01:26:42,000
Does it bother you,
Zeke? My body?

1048
01:26:42,160 --> 01:26:45,800
- I'm getting kind of
used to it myself.
- But I saw you take the test.

1049
01:26:45,960 --> 01:26:50,560
Zeke, how the hell can you
be sure what you saw?

1050
01:26:51,920 --> 01:26:55,800
It was sweet of you
to bond with me.

1051
01:26:55,960 --> 01:26:57,760
To be nice to me was sweet.

1052
01:27:00,960 --> 01:27:02,920
Will it work again, baby?

1053
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:06,560
Do you like
what you see?

1054
01:27:10,640 --> 01:27:13,120
Zeke.

1055
01:27:30,640 --> 01:27:33,360
- Take this.
- Now, Marybeth.

1056
01:27:33,520 --> 01:27:35,800
- You sniff it.
- You're out of your fucking mind.

1057
01:27:35,960 --> 01:27:38,880
I'm not taking any chances. I leave for
five minutes, and everyone's an alien.

1058
01:27:39,040 --> 01:27:42,000
Now if I have to Men ln Black your ass,
you're gonna fucking sniff it.

1059
01:27:44,120 --> 01:27:46,240
Happy now?

1060
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:07,840
Jesus. I'm fucking
seeing two of everything.

1061
01:28:10,480 --> 01:28:13,200
Zeke. Zeke!

1062
01:28:20,560 --> 01:28:23,120
Come on, buddy.
Get up.

1063
01:28:26,560 --> 01:28:28,840
-
- He's over here.

1064
01:28:43,760 --> 01:28:48,280
Casey, come out, come out,
wherever you are.

1065
01:28:53,880 --> 01:28:56,440
You know,
in my world, Casey,

1066
01:28:56,560 --> 01:29:00,200
there were limitless oceans
as far as the eye could see.

1067
01:29:00,360 --> 01:29:03,000
A beautiful home
until it started to dry up.

1068
01:29:03,160 --> 01:29:05,200
So I escaped,

1069
01:29:05,360 --> 01:29:08,560
came here and met you.

1070
01:29:08,720 --> 01:29:11,040
All of you.

1071
01:29:11,200 --> 01:29:13,600
All of you were different
from the others.

1072
01:29:13,760 --> 01:29:15,560
Thanks, pal.

1073
01:29:15,720 --> 01:29:18,040
You were lost and lonely,
just like me.

1074
01:29:18,200 --> 01:29:23,000
And I thought that maybe
I could give you a taste of my world:

1075
01:29:23,160 --> 01:29:27,480
a world without anger,
without fear, without attitude.

1076
01:29:27,640 --> 01:29:30,840
Where the underachiever
goes home at night to parents who care.

1077
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,720
The jock can be smart,
the ugly duckling beautiful,

1078
01:29:33,880 --> 01:29:35,960
and the class wuss doesn't
have to live in terror.

1079
01:29:36,120 --> 01:29:41,320
And the new girl-- Well,
she can just fit right in with
people who are just like her.

1080
01:29:44,920 --> 01:29:48,600
You see, Casey, even Marybeth's
feelings can be hurt...

1081
01:29:48,760 --> 01:29:51,480
by a bunch of pathetic,
lost, little outcasts...

1082
01:29:51,640 --> 01:29:55,160
who truly believe that their
disaffected lonely life...

1083
01:29:55,320 --> 01:29:57,560
is the only way
they can survive.

1084
01:29:57,720 --> 01:30:01,840
I can make you a part of something
so special, Casey, so perfect,

1085
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,120
so fearless.

1086
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:08,760
Don't you want that, Casey?

1087
01:30:08,920 --> 01:30:11,760
I'd rather be afraid.

1088
01:30:11,920 --> 01:30:15,080
Fine. All right.
Have it your way.

1089
01:30:15,240 --> 01:30:18,080
'Cause this is where your land
of fiction gets it right.

1090
01:30:18,240 --> 01:30:21,480
We win.
End of story.

1091
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:53,400
-
-

1092
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:30,000
Guaranteed to jack you up.|

1093
01:31:35,480 --> 01:31:37,640
-
-

1094
01:31:38,760 --> 01:31:41,720
-
-

1095
01:32:09,440 --> 01:32:12,360
You wouldn't have
liked it here anyway.

1096
01:32:36,600 --> 01:32:39,760
Stokes. Stokes.

1097
01:32:42,680 --> 01:32:46,440
Are you... you?

1098
01:32:47,520 --> 01:32:50,720
I think so.

1099
01:32:50,880 --> 01:32:53,320
I hope so.

1100
01:32:56,920 --> 01:32:59,360
-
- Fuck!

1101
01:33:02,120 --> 01:33:05,360
- Shit!
- Is it over?

1102
01:33:07,960 --> 01:33:09,720
Yeah.

1103
01:33:21,080 --> 01:33:24,280
All right, you little fuck-pukes,
quit screwing around!

1104
01:33:24,440 --> 01:33:27,800
As you
can see, life has returned
to normal at Herrington High...

1105
01:33:27,960 --> 01:33:32,680
after the mysterious disappearance of
several faculty members one month ago.

1106
01:33:32,840 --> 01:33:35,920
Both the local authorities and
the F. B. I. have largely discounted...

1107
01:33:36,080 --> 01:33:39,880
several students' claim
that an extraterrestrial was involved.

1108
01:33:40,040 --> 01:33:42,440
A spokesperson for the F. B. I.
has indicated...

1109
01:33:42,600 --> 01:33:45,440
that no substantiating evidence
has been found.

1110
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:47,680
That goes for you too, Zeke!

1111
01:33:47,840 --> 01:33:51,160
Just 'cause you're the new guy doesn't
mean we're gonna cut you any slack!

1112
01:33:51,320 --> 01:33:53,560
Put that butt out
and get in there!

1113
01:33:53,720 --> 01:33:56,440
Now bring that camera over here.

1114
01:33:58,840 --> 01:34:00,720
When do you think they're
gonna find a new story?

1115
01:34:00,880 --> 01:34:03,320
Haven't they milked our little
high school invasion to death?

1116
01:34:03,480 --> 01:34:06,040
Although
there has been no evidence of foul play,

1117
01:34:06,200 --> 01:34:08,280
the criminal investigation
is ongoing.

1118
01:34:11,640 --> 01:34:13,880
No regrets?

1119
01:34:14,040 --> 01:34:15,800
None whatsoever.

1120
01:34:38,960 --> 01:34:40,520
So, how does it feel
to be a hero?

1121
01:34:42,240 --> 01:34:44,480
It's all right, I guess.

1122
01:34:46,080 --> 01:34:47,280
I don't know, it's...

1123
01:34:54,480 --> 01:34:57,240
- different.
-
That's him over there. Hey, Casey.

1124
01:34:57,400 --> 01:34:58,960
Your fan club's here again.

1125
01:34:59,120 --> 01:35:01,000
Network or local?

1126
01:35:01,160 --> 01:35:03,040
Both.

1127
01:35:03,200 --> 01:35:05,840
You know, you can be
pretty cool sometimes.

1128
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:09,080
Things sure have changed,
haven't they?

1129
01:35:17,480 --> 01:35:19,960
# One way out #

1130
01:35:20,120 --> 01:35:24,320
# Is all you're ever
gonna get from #

1131
01:35:24,480 --> 01:35:28,680
# Those who'll hand it out #

1132
01:35:28,840 --> 01:35:31,320
# Don't ever let it upset you #

1133
01:35:31,480 --> 01:35:36,840
# 'Cause they'll put words
into your mouths #

1134
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,440
# They're making you
feel so ashamed #

1135
01:35:41,080 --> 01:35:44,600
# They're making you
take all the blame #

1136
01:35:44,760 --> 01:35:48,080
# They're making you cold
in the night #

1137
01:35:48,240 --> 01:35:51,480
# They're making you question
your heart and your soul #

1138
01:35:51,640 --> 01:35:54,600
# And I think that
it's not quite right #

1139
01:35:57,560 --> 01:36:02,280
# Hey, stay young
and invincible #

1140
01:36:02,440 --> 01:36:04,880
# 'Cause we know
just what we are and #

1141
01:36:05,040 --> 01:36:09,640
# Come what may
we're unstoppable #

1142
01:36:09,800 --> 01:36:13,200
# 'Cause we know

1143
01:36:13,360 --> 01:36:16,760
# Yeah, we know

1144
01:36:16,920 --> 01:36:19,640
# Yeah, we know

1145
01:36:28,600 --> 01:36:33,760

1146
01:36:33,920 --> 01:36:36,400
# They're making me

1158
01:37:40,680 --> 01:37:43,440
# But never leave the stream #

1159
01:37:43,600 --> 01:37:45,760
# Of warm impermanence and #

1160
01:37:45,920 --> 01:37:48,720
# So the days
float through my eyes #

1161
01:37:48,880 --> 01:37:52,440
# But the days
still seem the same #

1162
01:37:52,600 --> 01:37:56,800
# And these children
that you spit on #

1163
01:37:56,960 --> 01:38:00,920
# As they try
to change their worlds #

1164
01:38:01,080 --> 01:38:04,800
# Are immune
