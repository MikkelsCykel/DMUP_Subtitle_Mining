Hold it, hold it, hold it. Georgia.

00:01:09,502 --> 00:01:12,665
Sister Abernathy is singing
three times as loud as you...

3
00:01:12,772 --> 00:01:15,138
and she just had her tonsils out, sugar.

4
00:01:17,777 --> 00:01:22,043
- How you gonna account for that?
- I'm sorry, Reverend, I thought I was.

5
00:01:22,148 --> 00:01:24,048
It's all right, baby. It's all right.

6
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:27,517
Now, as an incentive for us all
to be in full voice...

7
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:31,283
on Sunday, our very own
Senator Dillings will be here...

8
00:01:31,391 --> 00:01:34,952
to help us kick off our Community
Redevelopment Program. Amen.

9
00:01:35,061 --> 00:01:36,619
Amen!

10
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:23,772
Hi, ma'am.

11
00:02:24,377 --> 00:02:25,435
Okay.

12
00:02:27,514 --> 00:02:31,211
Okay, here we go.
Domino, Lean Cuisine.

13
00:02:32,018 --> 00:02:35,419
You take the paper towel, right?
Oh, and mayonnaise.

14
00:02:36,956 --> 00:02:37,945
That's it.

15
00:02:38,057 --> 00:02:39,046
- That's it?
- Yes.

16
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:58,171
- Hey, little mama, that pretty.
- Check it out, man. Yeah.

17
00:02:58,278 --> 00:03:01,270
Let me holla at you for a sec.
Don't you got no time for nobody?

18
00:03:21,167 --> 00:03:22,634
Hey, Miss Byrd.

19
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:25,800
Hey. Any problems with the car today?

20
00:03:25,905 --> 00:03:28,430
Some gunshots.
Nobody mess with the car, though.

21
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:31,908
Okay, Darius, so you come by
in exactly 75 minutes and I'll be ready.

22
00:03:32,011 --> 00:03:33,740
Yes, ma'am. Me, too.

23
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:40,280
<i>Yeah! Welcome back!
Welcome back to Emeril Live!</i>

24
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:43,082
<i>Emeril Lagasse here. We're
making chicken four ways tonight.</i>

25
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:46,181
<i>Wait till you see this dish
that I got coming up right now for you.</i>

26
00:03:46,292 --> 00:03:48,590
Poulet Tchoupitoulas.

27
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:50,993
<i>Poulet Tchoupitoulas.</i>

28
00:03:51,097 --> 00:03:52,359
<i>Oh, yeah, baby!</i>

29
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:55,828
<i>You can't see this at home,
but he is happy, this chicken.</i>

30
00:03:55,935 --> 00:03:58,495
<i>He's clapping for Doc Gibbs
and the Emeril Live Band!</i>

31
00:03:58,605 --> 00:04:00,163
<i>He's just... Oh, yeah.</i>

32
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:05,370
<i>You gotta split him in half...</i>

33
00:04:05,478 --> 00:04:08,106
<i>and then we're gonna make
what I call a paste.</i>

34
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:11,275
<i>This chicken, skin-side down...</i>

35
00:04:11,384 --> 00:04:12,851
Skin-side down.

36
00:04:13,686 --> 00:04:16,621
<i>Now, for this Poulet Tchoupitoulas...</i>

37
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:19,191
<i>maybe some of this fumé blanc
would work.</i>

38
00:04:19,292 --> 00:04:22,318
<i>So, a little splash like this. Okay?</i>

39
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:23,952
<i>Or a big splash!</i>

40
00:04:25,531 --> 00:04:26,691
<i>Like that!</i>

41
00:04:28,701 --> 00:04:32,797
<i>Bread pudding with onions,
with sweet corn, and andouille sausage.</i>

42
00:04:32,905 --> 00:04:34,395
<i>Okay? Oh, yeah.</i>

43
00:04:34,507 --> 00:04:37,704
<i>'Cause the Poulet Tchoupitoulas with
the bread pudding.</i>

44
00:04:37,844 --> 00:04:38,868
<i>Bam!</i>

45
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:41,838
Look at that! That's looking good!

46
00:04:49,722 --> 00:04:51,690
I don't suppose you're gonna have any?

47
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:54,589
Lord, no.
I don't eat nothing but my Lean Cuisine.

48
00:04:56,329 --> 00:04:58,024
What is that book, anyway?

49
00:04:59,832 --> 00:05:03,359
- How do you like them greens?
- Oh, man, it's the bomb!

50
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:05,835
Well, good.
I mixed them this time, you know.

51
00:05:05,938 --> 00:05:07,530
Collard greens...

52
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:11,201
and of course, your favorite,
turnip greens.

53
00:05:12,745 --> 00:05:15,646
- And I got plenty for your grandpa.
- Cool, thanks.

54
00:05:22,755 --> 00:05:23,881
Sugar!

55
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:27,390
I just got these pants.

56
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,491
Always doing this.

57
00:05:59,325 --> 00:06:01,088
Darius, what are you doing?

58
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:03,423
That is my private property.

59
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:06,225
- I was just looking. What is it?
- It's nothing.

60
00:06:06,332 --> 00:06:08,630
It's just what it says, just possibilities.

61
00:06:08,735 --> 00:06:10,635
Just things I'm interested in.

62
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:12,937
Including this guy?

63
00:06:14,107 --> 00:06:15,699
- He your boyfriend?
- No.

64
00:06:16,776 --> 00:06:18,300
He's just an idea.

65
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:20,436
I mean, he's a real guy...

66
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:23,037
Why are you snooping around
my stuff, anyway?

67
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:31,155
So, what's his name?

68
00:06:31,824 --> 00:06:32,813
Who?

69
00:06:34,093 --> 00:06:35,651
None of your business.

70
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:38,724
I'll tell you what his name is.
His name is lucky mother...

71
00:06:38,831 --> 00:06:39,889
What?

72
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:42,157
I know you might as well
go ahead leave my house now...

73
00:06:42,268 --> 00:06:44,031
if you're gonna be using
that kind of language.

74
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:45,866
I'm sorry,
but short of you telling me his name...

75
00:06:45,972 --> 00:06:47,530
I don't know anything better to call him.

76
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,971
His name is Sean.

77
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:52,439
- Sean Williams.
- Sean Williams, huh?

78
00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:54,638
And you better not say anything
to anybody.

79
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:55,736
I ain't.

80
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:05,255
There he is, there he is.
Okay, I'm not gonna say anything.

81
00:07:05,358 --> 00:07:07,986
- You just talk to him.
- No, I'm not going to talk to him.

82
00:07:10,863 --> 00:07:12,888
...just to say hello. All right?

83
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:15,194
Go and talk to him. Stop him.

84
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:19,595
- Good morning, Miss Byrd.
- Mr. Williams.

85
00:07:19,972 --> 00:07:22,566
What was that? Was that power flirting?

86
00:07:22,675 --> 00:07:23,869
I don't know.

87
00:07:23,976 --> 00:07:26,877
Oh, my, my, my.
You could crack a walnut with that ass.

88
00:07:26,979 --> 00:07:28,037
Girl, stop!

89
00:07:31,184 --> 00:07:32,913
Don't you have somewhere to be?

90
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:34,111
You know what we need to do?

91
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:37,314
We need to get you out of these
frumpy clothes and into something...

92
00:07:37,423 --> 00:07:40,790
- that shows off the real estate a little bit.
- No. Rochelle! This is a workplace.

93
00:07:40,893 --> 00:07:42,417
Seriously. Then you need
to go down there...

94
00:07:42,528 --> 00:07:43,825
and you need to talk to Mr. Big Stuff...

95
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:45,921
and you need to tell him
what you want for Christmas.

96
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:48,296
- You just sit in his lap...
- Hey! Rochelle, come on, now.

97
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:50,164
What? No...
What are you worried about?

98
00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:51,361
That they're going to fire you
in this place?

99
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:52,597
Take your coffee and go!

100
00:07:52,705 --> 00:07:55,196
You're the best damn worker they got
in this whole damn place.

101
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:57,333
They're not gonna fire you.
You're just scared.

102
00:07:57,443 --> 00:08:00,173
You're scared of some man
getting a hold of all that booty of yours!

103
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:01,507
Would you stop?

104
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:04,544
He could hold my booty.

105
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,509
Sean!

106
00:08:09,388 --> 00:08:10,650
<i>Attention Kragen shoppers...</i>

109
00:08:15,194 --> 00:08:16,957
Right. This piece goes here.

110
00:08:19,031 --> 00:08:20,396
There we go.

111
00:08:22,068 --> 00:08:25,697
It's still crooked, but, yeah, that's good.

112
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:27,796
- It's good, huh?
- No, no, no.

but that's all right.

115
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:39,075
Thank you.

116
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:54,059
- Miss Byrd.
- Georgia.

117
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:59,929
You had some light bulbs to change
or something, remember?

118
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:04,241
Yeah! Oh, yeah, yeah, light bulbs.

119
00:09:05,478 --> 00:09:07,309
Light bulbs.
You know, they be relying on me...

120
00:09:07,413 --> 00:09:08,402
Hey, I'll see you later.

121
00:09:08,514 --> 00:09:09,811
Yeah. Sure. Yeah.

122
00:09:15,755 --> 00:09:17,780
Is there something I can help you with?

123
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:20,758
That's quite a nice grill.

124
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:24,554
- Stainless steel, huh?
- Yeah. Durable.

125
00:09:26,165 --> 00:09:29,293
- Easy to clean?
- You just hose it down.

126
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:31,398
Just hose it down, huh?

127
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:41,675
- Are you on your break?
- Yes.

128
00:09:42,381 --> 00:09:45,714
Well, that's why I'm here.
I wanted to ask you something.

129
00:09:45,818 --> 00:09:47,012
Ask me what?

130
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:54,521
Do you think I'll get my store discount
if I buy this thing?

131
00:09:55,294 --> 00:09:57,922
Well, of course.
Of course you get your store discount.

132
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:00,157
But I just sold you a grill last week,
remember?

133
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:03,827
Yeah. But that was a hibachi.
That was for traveling.

134
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:09,105
I think somebody should've told you
when you got this thing...

135
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:12,837
that you're supposed to have a lawn
or a backyard or something.

136
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:16,881
Okay, how about a little more lifting
and a little less talking?

137
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:21,051
That looks good. Smells good, too.

138
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,045
All right, there you have it.

139
00:10:24,156 --> 00:10:28,490
<i>A simple Creole roasted duck hash
en croute.</i>

140
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:31,626
Now, what you can do with this here...

141
00:10:31,998 --> 00:10:34,592
is you can take a little bit
of the parsley...

142
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,999
and onion if you like,
if that's what you like.

143
00:10:38,104 --> 00:10:41,699
But here's what I like to do.
Now, this is only for the brave ones.

144
00:10:42,174 --> 00:10:44,642
For those
who don't get a lot of heartburn.

145
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:49,777
I like to kick some of that hot sauce
on there, spice it up something.

146
00:10:49,882 --> 00:10:52,112
Please, come on and enjoy some.

147
00:10:55,254 --> 00:10:56,551
Excuse me.

148
00:10:57,757 --> 00:11:00,191
Now, I made this special for you.

149
00:11:00,292 --> 00:11:01,691
I left the pine nuts out...

150
00:11:01,794 --> 00:11:04,262
'cause I know they get up
under your bridgework sometimes.

151
00:11:04,363 --> 00:11:05,625
Aren't you sweet?

152
00:11:05,731 --> 00:11:07,289
- Thank you.
- Excuse me.

153
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:12,030
Are you bucking for General
of the Salvation Army or what?

154
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:13,866
Stop feeding the moochers.

155
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:16,530
We always have...

156
00:11:16,642 --> 00:11:19,076
our Wednesday morning
sales demonstration, Mr. Adamian.

157
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:21,476
No, no.
That's exactly the kind of thinking...

158
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:24,014
that put this store in Chapter 11
in the first place.

159
00:11:24,116 --> 00:11:27,347
Now, Mr. Kragen, he's trying
to change the culture around here.

160
00:11:27,453 --> 00:11:29,944
And by culture, I mean money.

161
00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:32,354
Now, if you care about
your future here...

162
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:35,086
I suggest
you get with the program, Miss Byrd.

163
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:37,287
Have you read this? Kragen's awesome.

164
00:11:37,396 --> 00:11:39,694
- Everybody got one.
- Read it again.

165
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:42,361
Yeah. Yup?

166
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:44,036
Yup. Yup.

167
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:47,401
Well, then, hire another Santa.
Of course, he has to be fat.

168
00:11:47,506 --> 00:11:48,803
<i>Attention Kragen shoppers...</i>

169
00:11:48,908 --> 00:11:51,536
<i>today's pre-Christmas sales
are on the second level.</i>

170
00:11:56,515 --> 00:11:58,983
Georgia. I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to scare you. I'm sorry.

171
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:01,349
Oh, my God. I'm sorry.

172
00:12:01,454 --> 00:12:03,479
No. I'm sorry.

173
00:12:03,589 --> 00:12:06,524
I'm kind of in my own little world
up here.

174
00:12:07,293 --> 00:12:08,885
What brings you to cookware?

175
00:12:08,994 --> 00:12:11,724
It's that smell, to tell you the truth.
I can't help it.

176
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:15,096
It wafts down the escalator,
usually I can resist, but...

177
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:16,368
Oh.

178
00:12:16,702 --> 00:12:18,465
Oh, well, please have some.

179
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,868
I'll probably get fired over this.

180
00:12:20,973 --> 00:12:23,305
Did you ever have a smell
that triggers a memory?

181
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:25,775
This smells like my mama's house.

182
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,044
Thank you.

183
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:42,022
That's incredible. Incredible.

184
00:12:42,128 --> 00:12:44,790
You know,
I'm just trying to sell the cookware.

185
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:48,324
Where did you become a chef?

186
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:51,130
France, or someplace European
or something?

187
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:54,536
Oh, no, I'm not a chef.
I've never been to France.

188
00:12:55,407 --> 00:12:57,967
I ain't never been further north
than Mobile, Alabama.

189
00:12:58,077 --> 00:13:02,810
You know, it's just a hobby.
Something I really enjoy doing.

190
00:13:02,915 --> 00:13:06,009
- A hobby, huh?
- I never trained or anything.

191
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,981
- You gonna train?
- I don't know.

192
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:11,318
Someday. Maybe.

193
00:13:12,258 --> 00:13:16,319
Look. I was wondering,
sometime, if you're free...

194
00:13:17,229 --> 00:13:18,992
I thought maybe we could...

195
00:13:19,932 --> 00:13:22,025
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- I'll get it. I'll get it.

196
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:23,101
You got...

197
00:13:23,202 --> 00:13:24,567
Oh... Georgia!

198
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,916
Whoa! What happened? Is she okay?

199
00:13:44,023 --> 00:13:45,320
She hit her head.

200
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:49,218
- Give me a hand, please.
- So what? It's just a bump.

201
00:13:50,262 --> 00:13:52,628
Watch her head.
Don't hit her head again.

202
00:14:31,503 --> 00:14:35,132
Miss Byrd, can you hear me?
Can you hear me, Miss Byrd?

203
00:14:35,574 --> 00:14:38,771
Can you hear the words
that are coming out of my mouth?

204
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:40,937
How many fingers am I holding up?

205
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:43,844
Is it one, two, or more?

206
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:48,744
- What's going on here?
- Georgia, are you okay? Georgia?

207
00:14:49,121 --> 00:14:50,213
Oh, man.

208
00:14:50,322 --> 00:14:51,846
I think we should do a CAT scan.

209
00:14:51,957 --> 00:14:53,515
What?
That's a big ticket number, isn't it?

210
00:14:53,626 --> 00:14:55,594
I didn't think we did that kind of thing
around here.

211
00:14:55,694 --> 00:14:58,185
Well, we got a new machine.
Used, but new to us.

212
00:14:58,297 --> 00:14:59,821
Yeah, I don't know.

213
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:02,924
Sir, there could be
a huge workman's comp payout...

214
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:04,263
if we don't follow procedure.

215
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:06,167
All right,
only if it's absolutely necessary.

216
00:15:06,272 --> 00:15:09,139
I knew you'd understand.
Paperwork. Follow me.

217
00:15:10,776 --> 00:15:14,507
- Are you okay, Miss Byrd?
- Kind of nice to be off my feet.

218
00:15:15,481 --> 00:15:16,573
Here we go.

219
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:27,923
<i>Now, don't worry now, Miss Byrd.
Everything will be just fine.</i>

220
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,058
What?

221
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:40,031
No, this can't be right.

222
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:44,306
Oh, my God.

223
00:15:45,711 --> 00:15:47,042
Oh, my God.

224
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,450
<i>We're just going to try
one more time, Miss Byrd.</i>

225
00:15:58,490 --> 00:15:59,821
This is not good.

226
00:16:00,993 --> 00:16:02,654
This is not good at all.

227
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:05,829
What are we looking at?

228
00:16:05,931 --> 00:16:09,264
Well, we're looking at the results
of a virus you have, ma'am.

229
00:16:09,902 --> 00:16:12,336
- Virus?
- I believe it to be Lampington's disease.

230
00:16:12,438 --> 00:16:15,874
It's very rare and it's very harmless,
in most cases.

231
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,538
- In most cases?
- Yes.

232
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:20,009
What about my case?

233
00:16:20,112 --> 00:16:23,639
Well, I thought I'd misread
the first scan, so I did the second scan.

234
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:25,910
But that just confirmed it, you see?

235
00:16:27,219 --> 00:16:29,346
- Okay, so I have Lampington's?
- Yes.

236
00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:32,747
Well, which one do I have
if not the harmless one?

237
00:16:32,858 --> 00:16:35,554
Ma'am, I'm very sorry to tell you...

238
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:36,593
But l...

239
00:16:36,695 --> 00:16:38,754
You see,
in my opinion it's the kind that...

240
00:16:38,864 --> 00:16:42,322
Ma'am, please! This is very, very
difficult for me. I'm just...

241
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:43,927
Oh, dear.

242
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:46,437
I need to lie down.

243
00:16:47,706 --> 00:16:49,401
You see this area here?

244
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:52,033
- This is your mass.
- My mass?

245
00:16:52,144 --> 00:16:53,475
Your tumor.

246
00:16:53,645 --> 00:16:57,081
And this, and this, and this.

247
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:01,145
I'm sorry, Georgia,
but the virus has caused...

248
00:17:01,253 --> 00:17:03,744
a very advanced case
of Lampington's lesions.

249
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:06,919
Okay, well, exactly what
does that mean, Lampington's lesions?

250
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,961
And Dr. Gupta hasn't told you anything
about this, right?

251
00:17:10,062 --> 00:17:11,654
Well, I tried.

252
00:17:13,098 --> 00:17:14,258
Thanks.

253
00:17:15,734 --> 00:17:17,964
Without treatment, it's terminal.

254
00:17:19,438 --> 00:17:21,872
What? Like I'm gonna die?

255
00:17:22,474 --> 00:17:23,941
I'm very, very sorry.

256
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:26,071
But I feel fine.

257
00:17:26,178 --> 00:17:29,204
I feel great.
I just finished a Fat Flush and...

258
00:17:29,314 --> 00:17:31,680
No dizziness or fainting?

259
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:34,685
No. I got a tiny bump on my head,
that's all.

260
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:37,915
It's diabolical. Such a sneaky disease.

261
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:43,354
I'm afraid, in your condition,
you've got about three weeks to live.

262
00:17:43,595 --> 00:17:46,689
What? I got three weeks to live?

263
00:17:47,299 --> 00:17:48,561
Are you shitting me?

264
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:51,363
Four on the outside. I'm sorry.

265
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:55,201
You're sorry? Well, I'm sorry.
I can't accept that.

266
00:17:55,641 --> 00:17:58,109
Then I think you should see
Katherine Lenz.

267
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:00,075
Okay. Fine.

268
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:02,977
That's what I'm talking about.
Katherine Lenz, okay.

269
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:05,744
- Is that the brain specialist?
- No.

270
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:07,716
She's your HMO administrator.

271
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:11,954
Let me just save you some time here,
Miss Byrd.

272
00:18:12,057 --> 00:18:13,991
We won't cover you for this operation.

273
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,651
Well, what do you mean,
you won't cover me?

274
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:17,661
I'm covered through my HMO.

275
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:21,722
If you feel you're being treated unfairly,
these are our appeals procedures...

276
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:24,302
which you have every legal right
to pursue.

277
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:34,706
Well, what if I pay for it myself?
How much would that cost me?

278
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:50,353
The cost
of a median cranial debulking surgery...

279
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:53,226
is around $340,000.

280
00:18:53,732 --> 00:18:55,427
That's without anesthesia.

281
00:18:56,435 --> 00:18:57,732
You'll want that.

282
00:18:59,705 --> 00:19:01,366
Check again,
make sure I'm not covered.

283
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:30,201
You wait and you wait
for something big to happen...

284
00:19:32,604 --> 00:19:34,936
and then you find out you're gonna die.

285
00:19:49,087 --> 00:19:51,021
I really wanted to meet you.

286
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:55,420
And I should've ate that.

287
00:19:57,329 --> 00:19:59,297
I should've ate all that stuff.

288
00:20:00,265 --> 00:20:01,596
Especially this.

289
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:05,060
Put my foot in that. Darius loved that.

290
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:09,432
Now I'll never get to Karlovy Vary.

291
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:13,375
Chef Didier.

292
00:20:28,627 --> 00:20:30,686
<i>- Hello?
- Hi.</i>

293
00:20:30,796 --> 00:20:33,890
Hiya, sis!
I was just getting ready to call you.

294
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:36,331
You know, there's this guy
that I met in this club...

295
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:39,427
<i>and he said he's gonna introduce me
to some of his friends in Nashville...</i>

296
00:20:39,538 --> 00:20:42,598
I just need you
to take care of the kids for three days.

297
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:45,240
What you gonna do in Nashville?

298
00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:49,405
Girl, I am finally going to be
a country western singer.

299
00:20:50,816 --> 00:20:52,147
<i>Isn't that great?</i>

300
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:55,516
Tanya, ain't no such thing
as a black country singer.

301
00:20:55,621 --> 00:20:59,284
<i>You know, I am not asking you to
comment on the validity of my dreams.</i>

302
00:20:59,391 --> 00:21:03,418
Now can you...
Hold on. Anton, would you stop it?

303
00:21:03,528 --> 00:21:06,725
<i>- This child is going to kill himself!
- Listen, that's why I'm calling you...</i>

304
00:21:06,832 --> 00:21:09,596
What are you doing? Why can't you
watch the kids? What are you...

305
00:21:10,002 --> 00:21:11,663
<i>- I'm gonna have to call you back.
- But, I'm...</i>

306
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:15,001
<i>I told you to stop jumping.
Do it again and see what happens.</i>

307
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:16,665
<i>You think I'm playing?</i>

308
00:21:19,645 --> 00:21:23,376
Georgia, where have you been?
Adamian's been looking for you.

309
00:21:23,482 --> 00:21:24,949
Good, 'cause I'm looking for him, too.

310
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:26,881
- Why?
- I'm gonna take your advice.

311
00:21:26,985 --> 00:21:27,952
Huh?

312
00:21:28,053 --> 00:21:31,113
Look, remember when you said
life was too short to live the way I do?

313
00:21:31,223 --> 00:21:34,283
- Oh, I say a lot of things.
- Yeah, well, you were right.

314
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:37,422
What? What did I say?
What are you gonna do?

315
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:39,953
Georgia?

316
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:44,792
What did I say?

317
00:21:52,277 --> 00:21:53,437
You don't knock?

318
00:21:53,545 --> 00:21:56,139
You better have a hell of an excuse
for where you've been, Ms. Byrd.

319
00:21:56,248 --> 00:21:57,545
I do, I do.

320
00:21:58,684 --> 00:22:00,584
You see, Mr. Adamian...

321
00:22:01,253 --> 00:22:04,017
Excuse me, would you mind?
This is very important.

322
00:22:04,122 --> 00:22:08,115
- Actually, it's a matter of life and...
- What?

323
00:22:08,794 --> 00:22:10,125
Just turn it off.

324
00:22:13,198 --> 00:22:14,256
Yeah.

325
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:17,427
You're killing me
with the potato peelers.

326
00:22:17,536 --> 00:22:20,061
Move them
or I'll shove them down your throat.

327
00:22:24,776 --> 00:22:26,141
You got a problem?

328
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:28,644
Yes, I do.

329
00:22:35,887 --> 00:22:37,377
That's a $400 phone.

330
00:22:44,796 --> 00:22:46,127
Now I feel better.

331
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:49,198
That's company property.

332
00:22:49,301 --> 00:22:50,928
That's going to come out
of your paycheck.

333
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:54,301
Take it. Take the whole thing, okay?
It's worth it.

334
00:22:54,406 --> 00:22:57,967
This is not about you, okay?
It's not about me.

335
00:22:58,076 --> 00:22:59,270
It's about business.

336
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:01,437
- It's about the company.
- Mr. Adamian.

337
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:04,538
I want you to hear this.
This man lives his philosophy.

338
00:23:06,518 --> 00:23:10,249
<i>Rule One:
Life is not a popularity contest...</i>

339
00:23:10,355 --> 00:23:12,346
<i>but it is a contest.</i>

340
00:23:12,457 --> 00:23:14,687
<i>Boo-hoo, they don't like me.</i>

341
00:23:14,793 --> 00:23:18,092
<i>Rule Two: You grab
that scared little loser inside you...</i>

342
00:23:18,196 --> 00:23:20,061
<i>and beat the living crap out of him!</i>

343
00:23:20,165 --> 00:23:24,033
<i>Rule three: When is enough, enough?
Enough is never enough.</i>

344
00:23:27,806 --> 00:23:30,502
Enough is enough right now,
Mr. Adamian!

345
00:23:30,609 --> 00:23:32,304
I'm trying to talk to you!

346
00:23:32,944 --> 00:23:35,344
I'm trying to tell you what's...

347
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:39,474
Why am I even wasting my time
trying to talk to you?

348
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:41,575
You know what? I quit.

349
00:23:41,686 --> 00:23:43,415
- You what?
- I quit.

350
00:23:43,522 --> 00:23:46,184
- You can't.
- Why can't I?

351
00:23:46,291 --> 00:23:48,555
Fourth quarter sales are in the toilet
in this store...

352
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:50,594
and all the other stores, too,
for that matter.

353
00:23:50,695 --> 00:23:53,061
Your department has
the highest profit record in the place.

354
00:23:53,165 --> 00:23:55,156
I just... I can't afford to lose you.

355
00:23:56,468 --> 00:23:58,527
How come
you never told me this before?

356
00:23:58,637 --> 00:24:00,969
I didn't want you to do
what you're doing right now.

357
00:24:01,072 --> 00:24:02,334
Holding me up for more money.

358
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:05,842
Which I'm happy to pay.
As God is my witness.

359
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:09,471
As God is your witness, huh?
As God is your witness?

360
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:15,281
All right. I'm prepared to offer you
50 cents more an hour!

361
00:24:16,221 --> 00:24:18,985
75 cents more an hour. 75.

362
00:24:21,827 --> 00:24:26,730
<i>Ms. Byrd, $1 more an hour. $1.50.</i>

363
00:24:31,169 --> 00:24:34,161
Hey, Georgia. Your shift done already?

364
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:37,570
Yeah, I'm done.

365
00:24:38,009 --> 00:24:40,705
Listen, I feel terrible
about what happened the other day.

366
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:43,872
- I wanted to make it up to you.
- It wasn't your fault.

367
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:46,539
Well, anyway...

368
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:50,348
Hey, I have a pair of tickets
to the Hornets game.

369
00:24:50,722 --> 00:24:52,849
Now, the game
is a couple of weeks away...

370
00:24:52,958 --> 00:24:56,485
but I know you're a busy woman,
so I wanted to put my bid in early.

371
00:24:56,595 --> 00:25:00,964
Sean, there is nothing I would rather do
than to go to that game with you.

372
00:25:01,066 --> 00:25:02,590
Yeah? That's great.

373
00:25:03,768 --> 00:25:07,329
Well, look, I figured we'll go
to dinner early, then after the game...

374
00:25:07,439 --> 00:25:08,770
I can't go, Sean.

375
00:25:10,242 --> 00:25:12,733
I mean, it's not like I don't want to. I...

376
00:25:15,213 --> 00:25:16,407
I can't.

377
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:20,950
You have to be somewhere else.

378
00:25:22,254 --> 00:25:23,312
Yeah.

379
00:25:26,424 --> 00:25:28,415
Hey, well, Georgia. Georgia!

380
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:30,084
Look.

381
00:25:30,996 --> 00:25:33,123
I already paid for the ticket, so...

382
00:25:35,901 --> 00:25:37,994
maybe your plans might change, huh?

383
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:53,681
Brothers and Sisters...

384
00:25:54,352 --> 00:25:56,217
I'm sad to announce that...

385
00:25:56,321 --> 00:26:00,621
Senator Dillings will not be gracing
our flock this morning as planned.

386
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:03,751
Pressing business
in our nation's capital has kept him.

387
00:26:03,862 --> 00:26:08,162
But I'd like to take a moment of prayer
for the Senator.

388
00:26:08,934 --> 00:26:12,836
He toils so hard
toting the burden of our welfare.

389
00:26:13,171 --> 00:26:17,130
And I ask the good Lord
to guide his hand...

390
00:26:17,642 --> 00:26:20,907
in his important good works. Amen.

391
00:26:21,012 --> 00:26:22,775
- Amen.
- Amen.

392
00:26:24,983 --> 00:26:26,348
Oh, why me?

393
00:26:29,487 --> 00:26:32,422
- Oh, dear Lord, why me?
- Georgia?

394
00:26:32,524 --> 00:26:34,151
Why me, Lord? Why me, Lord?

395
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:37,695
- Oh, dear Lord! Lord, why me?
- Bless the Lord.

396
00:26:37,796 --> 00:26:40,026
Oh, Lord, no!

397
00:26:40,131 --> 00:26:43,328
Oh, no, no.

398
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:46,765
Lord! Lord, come on!

399
00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:49,370
Come on, Lord, why?

400
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:53,844
I don't understand!

401
00:26:54,746 --> 00:26:57,340
<i>I followed your Commandments, Lord</i>

402
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:59,349
<i>I followed your Commandments, Lord</i>

403
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:01,043
<i>Why in heavens me?</i>

404
00:27:01,152 --> 00:27:03,245
<i>Why in heavens me?</i>

405
00:27:03,355 --> 00:27:06,586
<i>I never slept around
even though my sister did!</i>

406
00:27:07,525 --> 00:27:09,356
<i>Why in heavens me, Lord?</i>

407
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:11,156
<i>Why in heavens me?</i>

408
00:27:11,262 --> 00:27:14,595
<i>I never cussed my boss
or nothing like that!</i>

409
00:27:14,699 --> 00:27:16,633
<i>Why in heavens me, Lord?</i>

410
00:27:16,735 --> 00:27:18,293
<i>Why in heavens me?</i>

411
00:27:18,403 --> 00:27:20,030
<i>- Why?
- Why?</i>

412
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:21,435
<i>- Why?
- Why?</i>

413
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:22,836
<i>- Why?
- Why?</i>

414
00:27:22,941 --> 00:27:24,033
<i>- Why?
- Why?</i>

415
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:25,541
<i>- Why?
- Why?</i>

416
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:29,705
<i>Come on, now, somebody tell me why!</i>

417
00:27:30,582 --> 00:27:31,981
<i>- Why?
- Why?</i>

418
00:27:32,083 --> 00:27:33,050
<i>Why, Lord?</i>

419
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:34,118
<i>Why, Lord?</i>

420
00:27:34,219 --> 00:27:35,208
<i>- Why, please?
- Why?</i>

421
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,287
<i>I got to know</i>

422
00:27:36,388 --> 00:27:38,253
<i>I got to know, God!</i>

423
00:27:38,356 --> 00:27:39,687
<i>Why me?</i>

424
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:44,587
<i>Why? Oh, why?</i>

425
00:27:44,896 --> 00:27:48,388
<i>Why, Lord? Why? Oh, come on</i>

426
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:54,495
<i>Why? Why? Why?</i>

427
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:59,067
<i>Why? Why? Why?</i>

428
00:28:55,033 --> 00:28:58,969
You're sure you want to liquidate
the entire IRA? All of it?

429
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:01,061
Yeah, and the bonds my mama left me.

430
00:29:01,172 --> 00:29:04,505
Well, I'm sure a disciplined woman
such as yourself...

431
00:29:04,609 --> 00:29:07,544
has a very useful purpose
for this money.

432
00:29:11,649 --> 00:29:12,741
Yes, I do.

433
00:29:14,385 --> 00:29:15,943
I'm just gonna blow it.

434
00:29:18,823 --> 00:29:20,723
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
we want to thank you...</i>

435
00:29:20,825 --> 00:29:22,520
<i>for flying with us on Christmas Day.</i>

436
00:29:22,627 --> 00:29:25,755
<i>We're going to make your trip
as comfortable as possible.</i>

437
00:29:28,366 --> 00:29:29,799
Stewardess...

438
00:29:30,168 --> 00:29:33,001
this person behind me
is giving me a hard time.

439
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:34,662
Okay, sure, sir.

440
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:37,537
Ma'am, would you mind
lowering your knees...

441
00:29:37,642 --> 00:29:40,873
so the gentleman in front of you
can put his seat back down?

442
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:45,514
Actually, I very much would mind.

443
00:29:46,317 --> 00:29:48,945
Am I going to have to
call the Air Marshal, ma'am?

444
00:29:49,053 --> 00:29:51,385
People been calling me ma'am
a lot lately...

445
00:29:51,489 --> 00:29:53,855
and, you know,
I'm hardly older than you.

446
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:55,152
Do people call you ma'am?

447
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:57,820
No... No, they don't.

448
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:00,664
Is there a problem here?

449
00:30:10,241 --> 00:30:13,267
Yes. Yes, there is.

450
00:30:13,945 --> 00:30:16,038
I'm gonna tell you what the problem is.

451
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:19,939
This greedy airline put all these seats
so close together...

452
00:30:20,051 --> 00:30:21,643
just so they can make more money.

453
00:30:21,753 --> 00:30:23,516
- Makes sense.
- Yeah.

454
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:24,952
All right?

455
00:30:25,089 --> 00:30:27,250
Now, I'm not flying
all the way to Prague...

456
00:30:27,358 --> 00:30:29,189
with some stranger in my lap.

457
00:30:29,694 --> 00:30:31,218
I know that's right.

458
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:34,628
That's a big boy.
That's a big old man right there.

459
00:30:34,732 --> 00:30:35,994
I can't... Look at him.

460
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:39,864
Had you chosen to fly first class...

461
00:30:41,639 --> 00:30:43,732
Ma'am? Hi.

462
00:30:44,142 --> 00:30:46,804
Had you chosen to fly first class
instead of economy...

463
00:30:46,911 --> 00:30:49,436
you would have had plenty of room
in one of our cocoons.

464
00:30:49,547 --> 00:30:51,708
- How much is it?
- Beg your pardon?

465
00:30:51,816 --> 00:30:53,977
How much for the damn cocoon?

466
00:30:54,085 --> 00:30:55,347
- Work it!
- I like that.

467
00:30:55,453 --> 00:30:57,011
- All right.
- Hear, hear.

468
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:05,051
For our first class clients
flying with us during the holidays...

469
00:31:05,163 --> 00:31:07,495
we thought we would do
something special.

470
00:31:21,746 --> 00:31:25,011
Thank you. Wait, don't go.
Just leave that right here.

471
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:40,495
Look at that taxi line.

472
00:31:41,499 --> 00:31:43,763
Oh, this is gonna take forever.

473
00:32:30,682 --> 00:32:34,243
That's it. That's the Pupp.
That's the hotel I'm going to.

474
00:32:46,497 --> 00:32:47,657
Who is that?

475
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:52,929
- What's going on?
- I'm not sure, Congressman.

476
00:32:53,438 --> 00:32:54,803
Who is that?

477
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:59,003
All I know, Senator, is that the last time
someone arrived by helicopter...

478
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:01,738
it was Elton John. Sir Elton John.

479
00:33:02,113 --> 00:33:03,137
Wow.

480
00:33:16,627 --> 00:33:18,618
Hello. Welcome!

481
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:20,459
- Thank you.
- Welcoming.

482
00:33:21,399 --> 00:33:25,267
- You are here for retreat of the health?
- I guess you could say that.

483
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:27,369
How are you?

484
00:33:27,538 --> 00:33:30,439
Well I'm hung-over, I'm jet-lagged.
I'm dying.

485
00:33:30,541 --> 00:33:33,601
- Other than that, I'm fine, thank you.
- Great, great.

486
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:41,516
Oh, you are from Louisiana?

487
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:44,484
Your Senator Dillings, he here now.
Skiing.

488
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:47,685
- Senator Dillings is here skiing?
- Yes.

489
00:33:47,792 --> 00:33:50,818
Well, that explains why he didn't make it
to our meeting on Sunday.

490
00:33:50,928 --> 00:33:53,590
- Please, I'll meet you at reception desk.
- Okay.

491
00:33:58,002 --> 00:34:00,197
And here I was thinking I might not fit in.

492
00:34:20,124 --> 00:34:23,355
<i>- Excuse me. Georgia Byrd.
- Madame Byrd?</i>

493
00:34:25,263 --> 00:34:27,322
Welcome to Grandhotel Pupp.

494
00:34:27,698 --> 00:34:29,928
Come on. Y'all really say it like that?

495
00:34:30,034 --> 00:34:31,433
- Pupp.
- Pupp.

496
00:34:31,536 --> 00:34:32,901
- Pupp.
- Pupp.

497
00:34:33,304 --> 00:34:35,738
I'm sorry, Miss Byrd,
but your room is not ready yet.

498
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:38,308
We weren't expecting you
for two more hours.

499
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:41,071
Well, I wasn't expecting
to take a helicopter.

500
00:34:41,546 --> 00:34:44,037
But my time is kind of precious
lately now.

501
00:34:44,148 --> 00:34:45,877
Don't y'all have anything available now?

502
00:34:45,983 --> 00:34:47,450
I'll check it.

503
00:35:01,065 --> 00:35:03,829
Don't that ceiling ever just
make you want to cry?

504
00:35:04,235 --> 00:35:06,226
I've never noticed, madam.

505
00:35:07,138 --> 00:35:09,231
Only the presidential suite.

506
00:35:10,074 --> 00:35:13,134
It's €3,000 a night.

507
00:35:14,011 --> 00:35:16,479
About $4,000 a night.

508
00:35:18,549 --> 00:35:20,312
Did you see me blink?

509
00:35:22,153 --> 00:35:23,882
Madam Byrd, welcome.

510
00:35:23,988 --> 00:35:26,991
I know that you will find our
presidential suite most comfortable.

511
00:35:27,258 --> 00:35:30,625
- Mr. Kragen, would you sign my book?
- Yes.

512
00:35:32,396 --> 00:35:35,456
- Matthew Kragen.
- You know Mr. Kragen?

513
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:39,534
We are so honored that he comes
to our hotel every year at this time.

514
00:35:42,406 --> 00:35:45,102
- You playing with me, right?
- Pardon me?

515
00:35:45,409 --> 00:35:47,900
- Oh, not you, Him.
- Excuse me.

516
00:35:48,112 --> 00:35:49,704
Is the spelling okay?

517
00:35:50,948 --> 00:35:52,848
You get yourself
young, hip and rich, okay?

518
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:54,508
- Thank you.
- Mr. Kragen, sir.

519
00:35:54,619 --> 00:35:57,144
- I hope everything's okay.
- Wonderful, Arturo, wonderful.

520
00:35:57,255 --> 00:36:00,850
- And will Mrs. Kragen be joining us?
- Well, not this trip, Arturo.

521
00:36:00,958 --> 00:36:02,425
This is strictly business.

522
00:36:02,527 --> 00:36:06,019
As always, if there's anything,
even the slightest thing, you will tell me.

523
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:09,258
- Well, I won't, but she will.
- Lf I need you, I'll call you.

524
00:36:09,367 --> 00:36:10,664
Excellent.

525
00:36:11,602 --> 00:36:13,365
Can you believe that?

526
00:36:17,141 --> 00:36:19,939
Don't worry about it. Now, listen,
just double-check everything...

527
00:36:20,044 --> 00:36:22,512
and I want to keep tabs
on the Congressman and the Senator.

528
00:36:22,613 --> 00:36:26,208
Schmooze, impress, whatever it takes.
This deal's got to happen.

529
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:29,813
Madam Byrd.
Felipe will show you to your suite.

530
00:36:29,921 --> 00:36:30,979
Okay.

531
00:36:32,423 --> 00:36:34,789
Matthew, Miss Burns.

532
00:36:35,126 --> 00:36:38,653
The Senator's gone skiing
for the 83rd time. Let's go have a drink.

533
00:36:40,097 --> 00:36:42,622
Get upstairs and put some silk on.

534
00:36:43,134 --> 00:36:44,499
Congressman!

535
00:36:49,006 --> 00:36:52,498
If it's any consolation,
he's gonna have a shitty fourth quarter.

536
00:36:55,313 --> 00:36:56,678
Who is that?

537
00:36:56,981 --> 00:37:01,281
<i>Oh, Mademoiselle Byrd. Very rich.
From Louisiana.</i>

538
00:37:02,587 --> 00:37:04,953
She and Senator Dillings
were supposed to have...

539
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:07,183
a very important meeting together.

540
00:37:10,962 --> 00:37:14,693
Hang on, let me give you a little
something for your troubles.

541
00:37:14,799 --> 00:37:17,597
I haven't quite figured out
this money yet.

542
00:37:18,202 --> 00:37:21,069
Did I just give you
a ridiculously large tip?

543
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:23,671
No, madam.

544
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:26,676
Now, more reasonable.

545
00:37:30,615 --> 00:37:32,674
- Bye-bye.
- Bye!

546
00:37:44,528 --> 00:37:46,587
What world was I living in?

547
00:37:54,672 --> 00:37:57,698
Make me international.

548
00:37:59,877 --> 00:38:01,344
We could try.

549
00:38:28,873 --> 00:38:30,465
Give me my money.

550
00:38:31,676 --> 00:38:33,303
I can't wear this.

551
00:38:33,544 --> 00:38:36,638
Oh, yeah, there we go. Like that.

552
00:38:54,532 --> 00:38:57,262
You think anybody'd call me ma'am
in this outfit?

553
00:38:57,668 --> 00:38:59,499
- No.
- Definitely not.

554
00:39:13,217 --> 00:39:16,448
<i>- Table for one, please.
- Yes, mademoiselle.</i>

555
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:18,515
Please.

556
00:39:29,066 --> 00:39:31,034
May I take your pashmina?

557
00:39:31,836 --> 00:39:34,134
Oh, is that what this thing is?

558
00:39:36,107 --> 00:39:37,165
Sure.

559
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:40,271
Hello, sister.

560
00:39:43,981 --> 00:39:45,710
Who the hell is she?

561
00:39:46,117 --> 00:39:48,085
<i>- Mademoiselle.
- Thank you.</i>

562
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:01,427
Her name is Georgia Byrd.

563
00:40:01,532 --> 00:40:05,263
She's loaded and she's an old crony
of Dillings from Louisiana.

564
00:40:07,471 --> 00:40:08,438
L...

565
00:40:08,606 --> 00:40:09,937
I'm sorry.

566
00:40:11,475 --> 00:40:13,136
No. It's okay, it's okay.

567
00:40:13,844 --> 00:40:15,744
Water. Flat. No ice.

568
00:40:16,046 --> 00:40:17,638
- Please, serve everyone.
- Of course.

569
00:40:17,748 --> 00:40:20,273
Matthew, what are the chances
of our meeting Chef Didier?

570
00:40:20,384 --> 00:40:23,046
Margaret here's got a couple
of his books. She's a big fan.

571
00:40:23,154 --> 00:40:25,088
Is that right? Arturo!

572
00:40:25,523 --> 00:40:26,751
Yes, sir.

573
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:32,688
Make sure Didier comes and says hello
to the table.

574
00:40:32,797 --> 00:40:34,697
And fire that guy.

575
00:40:42,406 --> 00:40:46,103
<i>For the specialties de maison,
we have the cassoulet.</i>

576
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:49,406
We have risotto Barolo with truffles.

577
00:40:49,814 --> 00:40:53,250
<i>The rouget citrus beurre blanc
with capers.</i>

578
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:56,476
Roast quail with brioche stuffing.

579
00:40:57,121 --> 00:41:01,820
And a braised lamb shank
with blood orange relish.

580
00:41:02,259 --> 00:41:04,352
Blood orange relish.

581
00:41:05,229 --> 00:41:06,992
Now, that all sounds so good.

582
00:41:07,097 --> 00:41:08,758
Will he have the same specials
tomorrow night?

583
00:41:08,866 --> 00:41:12,233
No. Chef Didier never creates
the same menu twice.

584
00:41:13,237 --> 00:41:15,967
Well, I guess I better try them all
tonight then.

585
00:41:17,274 --> 00:41:19,708
<i>Tout? AII?</i>

586
00:41:20,578 --> 00:41:23,240
<i>Tout, baby! Tout de suite.</i>

587
00:41:23,614 --> 00:41:26,378
Do you think he would do a risotto
without the dairy?

588
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:29,510
I think I'm going to have
the rouget citrus without the potatoes...

589
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:31,144
<i>and the blanc without the beurre.</i>

590
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:43,326
No butter, no cream, no wheat,
no dairy, no fat!

591
00:41:43,534 --> 00:41:45,900
<i>Merde! Why do they bother to eat?</i>

592
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:48,301
Next time, stick this in my neck!

593
00:42:04,321 --> 00:42:05,788
And no substitutions?

594
00:42:20,304 --> 00:42:22,033
I will do it myself.

595
00:42:23,507 --> 00:42:26,772
She has got them eating
right out of her hand.

596
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:30,775
Well, she's sure not watching
her cholesterol.

597
00:42:30,948 --> 00:42:33,382
I wish I could command
attention like that.

598
00:42:35,486 --> 00:42:36,953
Is that the lamb?

599
00:42:37,154 --> 00:42:40,248
<i>- Mademoiselle.
- Oh, look at that!</i>

600
00:42:43,294 --> 00:42:47,287
Looks so good!
Everything looks so good.

601
00:42:54,171 --> 00:42:55,536
<i>Bon appétit.</i>

602
00:42:57,441 --> 00:42:58,806
<i>Bon appétit.</i>

603
00:43:00,611 --> 00:43:01,669
Amen.

604
00:43:02,046 --> 00:43:05,846
I was thinking maybe we could get Bob
up to speed tomorrow at lunchtime.

605
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:08,350
Yes, Matthew. I'd like to know more
about this merger.

606
00:43:08,452 --> 00:43:09,612
Here he is!

607
00:43:14,124 --> 00:43:16,718
<i>How do you find everything,
mademoiselle?</i>

608
00:43:16,827 --> 00:43:18,624
- Arturo.
- Yes, sir.

609
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:21,159
I think he'll be by.

610
00:43:23,133 --> 00:43:25,294
I'm sure he'll be right over, sir.

611
00:43:26,136 --> 00:43:29,572
- I'll be up there, on top of the mountain.
- Okay. Will Margaret join us?

612
00:43:29,673 --> 00:43:31,231
Because we do need to talk
some business.

613
00:43:31,342 --> 00:43:32,900
Okay, what time?

614
00:43:33,477 --> 00:43:35,536
Depends on Kragen's schedule.

615
00:43:35,646 --> 00:43:37,580
You know, where I come from...

616
00:43:37,748 --> 00:43:41,115
we do a barbecue quail
with an andouille pudding.

617
00:43:41,485 --> 00:43:43,749
I think you would just love it.

618
00:43:44,855 --> 00:43:47,119
And, you know, call me crazy...

619
00:43:47,224 --> 00:43:50,091
but am I tasting rendered lards
of pork belly here?

620
00:43:50,194 --> 00:43:51,218
<i>Oui?</i>

621
00:43:51,528 --> 00:43:52,859
Pork belly?

622
00:43:54,264 --> 00:43:55,390
Oink, oink.

623
00:43:56,266 --> 00:43:57,961
Very sensitive palate.

624
00:43:58,068 --> 00:44:02,027
Half clarified butter and half pork fat.

625
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:05,233
- I knew it.
- No? But you keep it to yourself.

626
00:44:05,909 --> 00:44:09,675
You know how some people are
about pork's fat.

627
00:44:10,447 --> 00:44:11,414
Yeah.

628
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:15,110
They don't like the pork...

629
00:44:22,226 --> 00:44:24,217
Chef Didier, you're crazy!

630
00:44:27,931 --> 00:44:31,389
Matthew, you seem to know everybody.
Who is she?

631
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:34,069
I was gonna ask the Senator
the same question.

632
00:44:34,438 --> 00:44:37,339
- I don't know her.
- Really? You sure about that?

633
00:44:37,441 --> 00:44:40,376
Well, for your information,
I don't know everyone who's black.

634
00:44:41,078 --> 00:44:43,774
Well, apparently she knows you
from New Orleans?

635
00:44:43,881 --> 00:44:48,284
Really? Maybe it was last year's
Entrepreneurs of Diversity.

636
00:44:48,619 --> 00:44:51,417
Well, whoever she is, I'd sure like
to have her ordering 10 plates...

637
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:53,820
at a $10,000-a-plate fundraiser.

638
00:44:54,191 --> 00:44:56,557
Why, Bob?
Haven't I've been contributing enough?

639
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:58,252
No, Matthew, I didn't mean it that way.

640
00:44:58,362 --> 00:45:01,024
You've been very generous
and it's much appreciated.

641
00:45:11,975 --> 00:45:13,272
Dr. Gupta.

642
00:45:16,447 --> 00:45:17,778
Dr. Gupta.

643
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:23,914
Sir, if this is a medical question,
I'm still on my break...

644
00:45:25,723 --> 00:45:27,384
for two and a half more minutes.

645
00:45:27,491 --> 00:45:30,426
Well, actually, excuse me,
it's not about me.

646
00:45:30,527 --> 00:45:33,553
It's about Georgia Byrd.
Remember the lady who hit her head?

647
00:45:33,664 --> 00:45:37,191
Sir, why do you think
I'm so desperately trying to relax?

648
00:45:37,367 --> 00:45:39,597
Well, she's been acting
really strange lately.

649
00:45:39,703 --> 00:45:41,933
She up and quit her job.
Nobody's seen her.

650
00:45:42,039 --> 00:45:45,531
And I was wondering if you had said
anything that might have upset her?

651
00:45:45,642 --> 00:45:47,769
- Or if you know something...
- I'm sorry.

652
00:45:47,878 --> 00:45:51,177
Patient privacy prevents me
from commenting, I'm very sorry...

653
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:53,982
- You're gonna tell me!
- Okay, okay.

654
00:45:54,151 --> 00:45:56,551
- Sir?
- Tell me!

655
00:45:56,987 --> 00:45:59,182
Georgia Byrd is going to die.

656
00:45:59,523 --> 00:46:01,115
- What?
- I'm very sorry.

657
00:46:01,225 --> 00:46:03,318
- What?
- I'm very sorry, sir.

658
00:46:04,228 --> 00:46:05,889
No, this can't be.

659
00:46:06,797 --> 00:46:09,960
My break is over. We can talk about it.
Come, put me down.

660
00:46:19,409 --> 00:46:20,740
That's nice.

661
00:46:53,377 --> 00:46:55,004
I do it with love.

662
00:47:00,184 --> 00:47:01,242
Okay.

663
00:47:13,363 --> 00:47:16,730
And the gonging, flushing
negative energy.

664
00:47:20,904 --> 00:47:24,396
Wait. I gotta use the bathroom.

665
00:47:37,254 --> 00:47:39,848
They say these waters
have curative powers...

666
00:47:40,224 --> 00:47:41,987
let you live to be 100.

667
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:45,059
Yeah, well, I hope they work fast.

668
00:47:46,129 --> 00:47:50,088
Clarence Dillings.
Senator Clarence Dillings.

669
00:47:50,634 --> 00:47:53,831
- I know who you are.
- Oh, so, we have met.

670
00:47:54,271 --> 00:47:56,296
Entrepreneurs of Diversity?

671
00:47:56,607 --> 00:47:59,132
- No, afraid not.
- Washington?

672
00:48:07,551 --> 00:48:09,246
They do know each other.

673
00:48:09,753 --> 00:48:10,811
Well.

674
00:48:15,893 --> 00:48:17,053
Church?

675
00:48:18,428 --> 00:48:21,761
- But I didn't go to church last Sunday.
- That's right.

676
00:48:22,766 --> 00:48:26,258
You know, you left a whole lot
of church folk disappointed, Senator.

677
00:48:26,370 --> 00:48:28,338
People who voted for you.

678
00:48:31,241 --> 00:48:34,301
I hope you'll communicate
my sincerest regrets.

679
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:38,377
I don't wanna have nothing
to do with your regrets.

680
00:48:38,482 --> 00:48:40,450
I got my hands full of my own.

681
00:48:41,518 --> 00:48:44,248
I got a gut feeling about that woman.
She's trouble.

682
00:48:44,354 --> 00:48:47,414
You know, Matthew,
who was it who said:

683
00:48:47,524 --> 00:48:50,982
"Adversity is the stone
on which I sharpen my blade"?

684
00:48:51,295 --> 00:48:52,284
Me.

685
00:49:04,107 --> 00:49:05,404
Excuse me.

686
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:13,375
Ms. Byrd, is it?
We've not been introduced.

687
00:49:14,718 --> 00:49:16,151
- My name...
- There's no need.

688
00:49:16,253 --> 00:49:18,221
Everybody knows Matthew Kragen.

689
00:49:18,355 --> 00:49:22,086
The man for whom
"enough is never enough."

690
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:33,102
I mean, who is she?

691
00:49:33,303 --> 00:49:34,827
How do I know she's not part of some...

692
00:49:34,938 --> 00:49:36,667
consumer watchdog group
or something?

693
00:49:36,773 --> 00:49:38,434
Well, it's not like there's some law...

694
00:49:38,542 --> 00:49:41,534
against being at the same hotel
with a congressman and a senator.

695
00:49:41,645 --> 00:49:44,113
Actually, there is,
if they're on my plane and my dime.

696
00:49:44,214 --> 00:49:48,913
Well, watchdogs don't stay
in $4,000-a-night hotel suites, okay?

697
00:49:49,987 --> 00:49:52,717
So, how about you and I
just forget all about...

698
00:49:52,856 --> 00:49:55,154
retail empire building...

699
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:58,351
and let's just take a little bath? Yeah?

700
00:49:59,529 --> 00:50:00,587
I'll take a bath, all right.

701
00:50:00,697 --> 00:50:03,291
A $500-million bath
if these mergers don't go through.

702
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:06,494
You just keep your eyes open
and remember why we're here.

703
00:50:17,748 --> 00:50:19,978
Are you all right, Madam Byrd?

704
00:50:21,485 --> 00:50:25,444
Yeah. I just... I just love these sheets.

705
00:50:25,822 --> 00:50:29,622
I love them. I was just taking them
for a little ride around the block.

706
00:50:29,826 --> 00:50:32,294
I am Gunther. Floor valet.

707
00:50:32,796 --> 00:50:36,027
Oh, that was you
that put my clothes away.

708
00:50:36,366 --> 00:50:38,334
- Yeah.
- Okay.

709
00:50:38,969 --> 00:50:42,405
Well, Miss Gunther,
what do you do for fun around here?

710
00:50:42,773 --> 00:50:44,866
What do I do for fun, madam?

711
00:50:45,776 --> 00:50:49,234
I shine the guests' shoes
when they leave them out in the hall.

712
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:53,148
If that will be all.

713
00:50:53,984 --> 00:50:56,885
No, actually, that won't, Miss Gunther.

714
00:50:58,055 --> 00:51:00,615
I'm gonna be wanting to have
one of these snowboarding lessons.

715
00:51:00,724 --> 00:51:04,387
- Very good. Will that be all?
- No, no.

716
00:51:04,861 --> 00:51:06,294
No, it won't.

717
00:51:06,963 --> 00:51:10,364
I want some more
of these spa services. Like maybe...

718
00:51:11,868 --> 00:51:16,464
Maybe this algae flotation wrap
and the reflexology massage.

719
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:19,272
No anti-aging treatment?

720
00:51:21,511 --> 00:51:24,878
- No, I ain't worried about aging.
- So, that will be all?

721
00:51:27,617 --> 00:51:30,882
Yes! The colon irrigation treatment.

722
00:51:31,621 --> 00:51:35,853
That's my gift to you.
Sort of like a "let's be friends" gesture.

723
00:51:37,727 --> 00:51:40,161
Now, you think of me
when you're having it!

724
00:51:43,033 --> 00:51:44,022
Oh.

725
00:51:50,507 --> 00:51:52,737
I've been waiting my whole life
to do something like this.

726
00:51:52,843 --> 00:51:54,470
- All right then, let's go.
- Okay.

727
00:51:54,578 --> 00:51:56,603
- Just lean forward. Lean forward.
- Lean forward.

728
00:51:56,713 --> 00:51:59,546
Left leg, that's it. And go!

729
00:51:59,649 --> 00:52:04,416
Go, that's it. Just go! Yeah!
You got it, lean forward! Balance!

730
00:52:04,688 --> 00:52:06,656
Yeah! That's it. Lean...

731
00:52:08,592 --> 00:52:09,923
Are you all right?

732
00:52:11,061 --> 00:52:12,028
Let's go.

733
00:52:12,996 --> 00:52:14,588
- Let's turn.
- Oh, man.

734
00:52:14,698 --> 00:52:16,427
- You feel the rhythm?
- I feel the rhythm.

735
00:52:16,533 --> 00:52:18,228
- Yeah. Feel the rhythm.
- That's good.

736
00:52:18,335 --> 00:52:20,462
- That's it. Right. You got it?
- I think I got it.

737
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:23,368
So, go! Just lean forward.
Lean forward and go!

738
00:52:23,473 --> 00:52:26,704
Lean forward. Lean forward.
Lean forward.

739
00:52:26,877 --> 00:52:28,674
- Lean forward.
- Yeah, that's it, that's great.

740
00:52:28,778 --> 00:52:31,246
- Oh, Lord.
- That's great. No, no, no.

741
00:52:32,315 --> 00:52:35,773
Slow down. Slow down a bit.
No. Slow down!

742
00:52:36,052 --> 00:52:39,988
Turn the board sideways!
Slow, slow down!

743
00:52:42,692 --> 00:52:43,750
Stop!

744
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:54,727
<i>Scusi! Watch out!
Get out of my way! Watch it!</i>

745
00:53:03,079 --> 00:53:04,137
What?

746
00:53:10,554 --> 00:53:11,782
It's steep here, Matthew.

747
00:53:11,888 --> 00:53:14,322
Hey, Matthew, this is
a Black Diamond run.

748
00:53:14,424 --> 00:53:15,982
Yeah, you're looking good.

749
00:53:18,728 --> 00:53:21,329
- Look at her go!
- Matthew?

750
00:53:23,333 --> 00:53:24,459
Matthew!

751
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:46,318
- Enjoying yourself?
- Not really.

752
00:53:46,423 --> 00:53:47,515
Please, don't do that.

753
00:53:47,624 --> 00:53:49,251
I guess you don't believe in turning?

754
00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:52,419
I believe in it,
I just don't know how to do...

755
00:53:53,096 --> 00:53:54,927
Oh, hold me, hold me! Please!

756
00:53:57,934 --> 00:54:01,267
- Please get off of my skis!
- Okay, I think I've got it.

757
00:54:01,371 --> 00:54:02,395
Let me go.

758
00:54:03,106 --> 00:54:06,667
Sorry. I'm okay! I'm okay!

759
00:54:06,776 --> 00:54:08,004
Damn you!

760
00:54:08,245 --> 00:54:11,442
Nobody makes me do a face-plant!
Damn it!

761
00:54:11,548 --> 00:54:13,413
Watch your mouth!

762
00:54:18,054 --> 00:54:20,579
What the hell are you doing?
You trying to kill me?

763
00:54:20,690 --> 00:54:21,987
Watch out!

764
00:54:31,334 --> 00:54:33,165
Get over here, you!

765
00:54:34,971 --> 00:54:37,769
They should get you off this mountain!
You figure...

766
00:55:01,731 --> 00:55:04,256
You... You ski like that...

767
00:55:04,634 --> 00:55:07,000
you're gonna be in court
for the next two years!

768
00:55:07,103 --> 00:55:09,128
That's fine with me, baby.

769
00:55:14,744 --> 00:55:16,075
Oh, my God.

770
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:26,648
And we are going to leave you now...

771
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:30,187
- to relax and meditate.
- Thank you.

772
00:55:35,131 --> 00:55:36,428
Why, Lord?

773
00:55:38,101 --> 00:55:39,830
I don't want to die.

774
00:55:41,271 --> 00:55:42,761
I want to live.

775
00:55:49,112 --> 00:55:51,046
What are you trying to do to me, huh?

776
00:55:51,147 --> 00:55:53,138
You have big knot in neck.

777
00:55:53,583 --> 00:55:58,020
You do something at work where
you hold head in strange position.

778
00:55:58,121 --> 00:56:00,612
Excuse me? Are you suggesting that l...

779
00:56:00,724 --> 00:56:03,318
Too much holding phone
on neck, maybe.

780
00:56:04,494 --> 00:56:06,621
You know what?
Why don't you just shut up...

781
00:56:06,730 --> 00:56:09,255
and do what you're supposed to do,
okay?

782
00:56:09,366 --> 00:56:11,596
You're a masseuse, not a life coach!

783
00:56:11,701 --> 00:56:12,998
Excuse me.

784
00:56:21,644 --> 00:56:23,578
Hey. Hey!

785
00:56:25,815 --> 00:56:28,443
I don't like the way
you're talking to that woman.

786
00:56:28,885 --> 00:56:32,412
I'm sorry if I disturbed you, Ms. Byrd.
She was hurting me, though.

787
00:56:32,522 --> 00:56:36,014
I don't care. You don't talk
to working people that way.

788
00:56:36,359 --> 00:56:38,759
Now, it's plain to see
what the problem is here.

789
00:56:38,862 --> 00:56:41,831
You got tension in your neck 'cause
you keep going down on Mr. Kragen.

790
00:56:41,931 --> 00:56:43,330
And he's a married man.

791
00:56:43,433 --> 00:56:45,867
At least this poor lady
is trying to work it out of you.

792
00:56:45,969 --> 00:56:47,834
Don't take it out on Brigitta.

793
00:56:48,671 --> 00:56:49,763
Thank you.

794
00:56:52,776 --> 00:56:55,074
Anyway, enjoy your massage.

795
00:56:55,178 --> 00:56:57,476
- Thank you very much.
- Bye.

796
00:57:21,070 --> 00:57:24,039
Is it that obvious
that I'm sleeping with him?

797
00:57:29,846 --> 00:57:31,143
I knew it.

798
00:57:33,316 --> 00:57:36,513
None of the other women
at the company will even talk to me.

799
00:57:36,619 --> 00:57:38,348
I'm marked by this.

800
00:57:39,589 --> 00:57:43,116
And there's no one in my life
who I can talk to about it.

801
00:57:43,593 --> 00:57:47,188
Well, I wouldn't lose too much sleep
over what other people think.

802
00:57:47,864 --> 00:57:50,890
Now, come on, girl,
we're supposed to be meditating.

803
00:57:52,235 --> 00:57:54,703
I've been at the company six years.

804
00:57:55,371 --> 00:57:57,771
I've worked really hard, you know?

805
00:57:59,275 --> 00:58:02,244
Oh, you don't understand.
I hate the retail business.

806
00:58:02,345 --> 00:58:04,609
Oh, believe me, baby, I understand.

807
00:58:05,014 --> 00:58:07,949
I worked in the retail business
for 10 years myself.

808
00:58:10,587 --> 00:58:12,817
Look, I know this whole story.

809
00:58:13,690 --> 00:58:16,158
My sister was seeing a married man.

810
00:58:16,759 --> 00:58:18,488
Matthew's gonna leave his wife.

811
00:58:18,595 --> 00:58:21,758
It's a bad time for her right now,
but he is gonna leave his wife.

812
00:58:21,865 --> 00:58:25,460
Baby, come on, now.
I know you're holding out some hope...

813
00:58:26,236 --> 00:58:30,366
but come on, they're never bad people,
they're greedy people.

814
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:33,832
They want a little bit of this,
little bit of that, little bit of that...

815
00:58:33,943 --> 00:58:35,433
They ain't leaving their wives.

816
00:58:35,545 --> 00:58:38,309
Yeah, you just need to leave him.

817
00:58:39,115 --> 00:58:42,846
It's not that easy.
If I leave him, I'll have to quit my job.

818
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:46,018
What am I going to do?
I didn't finish school.

819
00:58:47,257 --> 00:58:49,623
Well, then you go back to school.

820
00:58:49,993 --> 00:58:52,052
There now, we solved it.

821
00:58:52,228 --> 00:58:54,890
Let's tackle something heavy,
like world hunger.

822
00:58:55,798 --> 00:58:58,858
Well, did you at least find out
what she's doing here?

823
00:58:59,002 --> 00:59:02,165
She's just here enjoying herself.
Unlike us.

824
00:59:02,272 --> 00:59:03,637
How can I enjoy myself?

825
00:59:03,740 --> 00:59:05,708
Dillings is suddenly telling me
that his committee...

826
00:59:05,808 --> 00:59:07,366
has problems with my acquisitions.

827
00:59:07,477 --> 00:59:10,173
Matthew, what does that
have to do with Georgia?

828
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:14,116
Oh, Georgia, is it now?
Oh, well, why don't you tell me?

829
00:59:14,217 --> 00:59:17,914
I don't know, Matthew.
She said she worked in retail.

830
00:59:18,688 --> 00:59:20,952
Did I mention to you how she told me...

831
00:59:21,057 --> 00:59:23,287
you were gonna have
a shitty fourth quarter?

832
00:59:24,093 --> 00:59:26,084
How can she possibly know
about our fourth quarter?

833
00:59:26,195 --> 00:59:27,685
I barely know about our fourth quarter.

834
00:59:27,797 --> 00:59:30,664
Well, maybe she's an executive
for Wal-Mart.

835
00:59:30,767 --> 00:59:33,258
I mean, the competition
wouldn't want to see you...

836
00:59:33,369 --> 00:59:36,338
triple the size of your retail empire,
would they?

837
00:59:36,539 --> 00:59:39,167
You know what? That's it. That's it!

838
00:59:39,542 --> 00:59:43,205
She's here to drive a wedge
between me and those guys.

839
00:59:43,947 --> 00:59:46,814
If I don't have their support,
my bill is dead on the floor.

840
00:59:46,916 --> 00:59:51,444
That's what's gonna happen, see?
I need to relax, that's what I need to do.

841
00:59:52,488 --> 00:59:55,252
Oh, God, my blood pressure is...

842
00:59:55,725 --> 00:59:59,354
You know what?
I need to just do something to relax.

843
01:00:00,763 --> 01:00:03,163
- Come here...
- Take a cold plunge, Matthew.

844
01:00:03,666 --> 01:00:04,724
What?

845
01:00:09,706 --> 01:00:10,900
Georgia?

846
01:00:19,015 --> 01:00:22,246
- You guys seen Georgia?
- I ain't seen her in a while.

847
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:23,608
No.

848
01:00:32,662 --> 01:00:35,062
Hey, what are you doing,
casing the place?

849
01:00:36,532 --> 01:00:39,524
- Where's Georgia?
- Hey, you're that guy.

850
01:00:39,636 --> 01:00:41,729
You're the Possibilities man.
The guy in the book.

851
01:00:41,838 --> 01:00:43,965
What? What book?
What are you talking about?

852
01:00:44,073 --> 01:00:45,438
- Where's Georgia?
- Hold on.

853
01:00:45,541 --> 01:00:47,372
- What?
- Hold on.

854
01:01:00,156 --> 01:01:02,090
Here, I found this in her garbage can.

855
01:01:02,191 --> 01:01:04,159
That's my employee of the month photo.

856
01:01:12,001 --> 01:01:14,299
- Did she say anything about me?
- No.

857
01:01:14,804 --> 01:01:16,567
Why? You like her, right?

858
01:01:17,607 --> 01:01:20,599
Easy, killer.
Did she say where she was going?

859
01:01:21,377 --> 01:01:23,845
A place with healing waters
or something.

860
01:01:23,946 --> 01:01:27,746
Look, it's really important that you
remember, all right, little man?

861
01:01:27,950 --> 01:01:30,111
Maybe it's in here somewhere.

862
01:01:30,453 --> 01:01:32,921
I know she told me before she left.

863
01:01:33,656 --> 01:01:38,116
I think this is it.
Calamari Vary, I think the name is.

864
01:01:38,227 --> 01:01:41,196
- Karlovy Vary?
- Yeah, Karlovy Vary, that's it!

865
01:01:49,539 --> 01:01:51,166
- Oh, good evening, Georgia.
- Hi.

866
01:01:51,274 --> 01:01:52,707
- How are you this evening?
- Good, thanks.

867
01:01:52,809 --> 01:01:53,935
Why don't you join us?

868
01:01:54,043 --> 01:01:57,012
We got plenty of room at our table,
don't we, Matthew?

869
01:01:57,847 --> 01:02:01,305
- Sure, yeah, why not?
- No, please. Please, come join us.

870
01:02:01,417 --> 01:02:04,011
- Yes, come, it's decided.
- Good evening, Ms. Byrd.

871
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:08,386
Chef Didier has reserved a special table
for you. If you'd like to come with me.

872
01:02:08,658 --> 01:02:12,424
Well, thank you,
but why don't you join me?

873
01:02:12,528 --> 01:02:14,359
It seems I have a special table.

874
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:21,336
- Thanks so much for having us.
- Oh, thank you. Thank you.

875
01:02:21,437 --> 01:02:23,200
You really look beautiful.

876
01:02:23,306 --> 01:02:24,898
- Yes, you do.
- Thank you.

877
01:02:25,007 --> 01:02:26,804
- You really do.
- Thank you.

878
01:02:28,377 --> 01:02:30,038
Pull up a chair, Matthew.

879
01:02:35,485 --> 01:02:37,680
Glad you decided to join us, Matthew.

880
01:02:43,292 --> 01:02:47,058
Could you maybe just... A little room.

881
01:02:52,668 --> 01:02:53,657
It...

882
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:57,069
Hi. Thank you so much, Chef Didier.

883
01:02:57,173 --> 01:02:59,038
No, you are my preferred guest...

884
01:02:59,142 --> 01:03:02,805
and I have prepared a special menu
just for you tonight.

885
01:03:03,713 --> 01:03:06,079
But I will make no substitutions.

886
01:03:06,349 --> 01:03:07,316
Don't worry.

887
01:03:07,416 --> 01:03:10,647
We will have your special menu
exactly the way you make it.

888
01:03:11,420 --> 01:03:12,819
No substitutions?

889
01:03:15,224 --> 01:03:16,816
No substitutions.

890
01:03:22,465 --> 01:03:24,126
That was delicious.

891
01:03:25,401 --> 01:03:27,266
- Oh, my goodness, I hurt myself.
- Thank you.

892
01:03:27,370 --> 01:03:30,134
So, Georgia,
Ms. Burns tells me you're in retail.

893
01:03:30,339 --> 01:03:31,465
I was.

894
01:03:31,607 --> 01:03:34,201
Well, you've obviously done very well
for yourself.

895
01:03:34,310 --> 01:03:36,744
Actually, I just clipped a lot of coupons.

896
01:03:38,314 --> 01:03:41,647
And when you say coupons,
you obviously mean bonds?

897
01:03:41,751 --> 01:03:44,584
No. No, I sold all my bonds.

898
01:03:44,921 --> 01:03:46,980
You sold all of your bonds?

899
01:03:47,223 --> 01:03:49,191
Ms. Byrd, as Chairman
of the Commerce Committee...

900
01:03:49,292 --> 01:03:52,227
<i>I'm always interested in how
sayw people such as yourself...</i>

901
01:03:52,328 --> 01:03:53,795
operate the market.

902
01:03:53,896 --> 01:03:56,660
Did you think that rates
were going up, or were you...

903
01:03:56,766 --> 01:03:58,358
pessimistic about the future?

904
01:03:58,467 --> 01:04:01,630
- Well, Congressman...
- Bob, please. Bob.

905
01:04:02,004 --> 01:04:06,270
Well, Bob, I find that the future
is too depressing to think about.

906
01:04:06,409 --> 01:04:08,138
Oh, come on, Georgia.

907
01:04:08,244 --> 01:04:09,768
Miss Byrd,
what are you doing tomorrow?

908
01:04:09,879 --> 01:04:11,676
I would very much like to continue this...

909
01:04:11,781 --> 01:04:13,442
Well, hold on, hold on, hold on.

910
01:04:13,549 --> 01:04:17,076
You see, tomorrow I've arranged
for our group to go to Moser.

911
01:04:17,186 --> 01:04:18,380
Moser? What's that?

912
01:04:18,487 --> 01:04:22,355
Moser! Glass. Factory.
All of us. Special tour.

913
01:04:22,959 --> 01:04:24,984
That's what we're doing tomorrow.

914
01:04:25,862 --> 01:04:28,797
To answer your question,
I'm going BASE-jumping, Bob.

915
01:04:28,898 --> 01:04:32,390
Really, BASE-jumping?
You're kidding! Well, why?

916
01:04:32,702 --> 01:04:35,671
Well, I hear it's a completely
liberating experience.

917
01:04:36,038 --> 01:04:38,199
Well, at least that's what
the brochure says.

918
01:04:40,843 --> 01:04:42,504
Oh, that is amazing.

919
01:04:42,612 --> 01:04:44,773
Oh, come on, Matthew,
why don't we all go along and watch?

920
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:46,109
It sounds like fun! Let's do that.

921
01:04:46,215 --> 01:04:48,683
That is a great idea.
Better than some glass factory.

922
01:04:48,784 --> 01:04:53,118
Fine, fine, fine.
But I'm not going there to watch.

923
01:05:01,764 --> 01:05:05,291
So, because it's a dam
and not a straight jump...

924
01:05:05,401 --> 01:05:06,390
Yes.

925
01:05:06,502 --> 01:05:09,733
...when you don't do it right,
you will catch the current...

926
01:05:09,839 --> 01:05:12,706
and it will slam you
in the side of the dam.

927
01:05:13,209 --> 01:05:15,404
So, we don't want that, okay?

928
01:05:16,178 --> 01:05:18,373
- So, are you ready?
- Yes, I am.

929
01:05:19,348 --> 01:05:21,407
- Go get them, Matthew!
- Come on!

930
01:05:24,620 --> 01:05:25,678
Damn.

931
01:05:27,690 --> 01:05:29,555
Okay, now we're gonna do this.

932
01:05:29,659 --> 01:05:32,219
I don't know what the hell makes people
want to do something like this.

933
01:05:32,328 --> 01:05:34,159
I try to avoid any plummeting sports.

934
01:05:34,263 --> 01:05:37,289
Matthew's only doing it
because Georgia's doing it.

935
01:05:37,533 --> 01:05:39,524
He's the most competitive person
in the world.

936
01:05:39,635 --> 01:05:41,364
He may have met his match in Georgia.

937
01:05:41,470 --> 01:05:42,664
Camcorder!

938
01:05:42,772 --> 01:05:44,501
Oh. Bob, Bob, the camera.
You got the camera going?

939
01:05:44,607 --> 01:05:46,871
- We're rolling! Go ahead!
- Okay!

940
01:05:46,976 --> 01:05:49,444
Oh, oh. He's gonna... There we go.
He's going over the rail.

941
01:05:49,545 --> 01:05:51,274
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, wow.

942
01:05:51,380 --> 01:05:53,075
Oh, my God.

943
01:05:53,215 --> 01:05:54,273
Oh, come on.

944
01:05:55,985 --> 01:05:57,612
All right, here we go.

945
01:05:57,753 --> 01:06:00,551
Okay. Look.

946
01:06:02,525 --> 01:06:04,493
I have told you before...

947
01:06:04,860 --> 01:06:08,091
we have lost a couple of people
doing this.

948
01:06:08,998 --> 01:06:11,193
- What, like people died?
- Yeah.

949
01:06:11,434 --> 01:06:14,096
- Sugar.
- Which one first?

950
01:06:14,770 --> 01:06:16,203
Ladies first.

951
01:06:16,939 --> 01:06:18,668
Ladies first. Okay.

952
01:06:19,108 --> 01:06:20,234
Ready?

953
01:06:20,776 --> 01:06:22,767
- Three...
- Wait, wait, wait, wait!

954
01:06:23,913 --> 01:06:28,213
- Okay. All right.
- Three, two, one, go!

955
01:06:38,794 --> 01:06:39,988
Perfect.

956
01:06:44,467 --> 01:06:45,934
Whoa, baby!

957
01:06:46,369 --> 01:06:47,427
Okay.

958
01:06:48,671 --> 01:06:52,573
Three, two, one, go!

959
01:06:54,410 --> 01:06:55,843
Is there a problem?

960
01:06:56,045 --> 01:06:58,343
Yeah, I'd say there's a problem, Klaus.

961
01:06:58,447 --> 01:06:59,846
I know a thing or two
about BASE-jumping.

962
01:06:59,949 --> 01:07:02,782
I know that the canopy is supposed to
be connected to the rigging and it's not.

963
01:07:02,885 --> 01:07:05,410
And that's how people get killed.
No wonder you've lost a few people.

964
01:07:06,255 --> 01:07:08,155
Here I come. Watch it now!

965
01:07:08,657 --> 01:07:10,784
Oh, hold it now!

966
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:12,393
I can't jump!

967
01:07:13,029 --> 01:07:15,725
Canopy not connected to rigging!

968
01:07:16,165 --> 01:07:18,429
- Mechanical difficulties!
- It's all right.

969
01:07:18,534 --> 01:07:20,798
- I don't know why this happens!
- It's all right.

970
01:07:20,903 --> 01:07:23,929
- What are you doing?
- Klaus, just shut up!

971
01:07:24,840 --> 01:07:26,034
Oh, man.

972
01:07:28,611 --> 01:07:29,942
- It's so...
- Disappointing.

973
01:07:41,190 --> 01:07:42,384
Really?

974
01:07:44,794 --> 01:07:47,854
She's the most amazing person
who ever came to this hotel.

975
01:07:47,963 --> 01:07:48,930
Oh, yeah.

976
01:07:49,231 --> 01:07:50,789
She lives on the edge.

977
01:07:51,267 --> 01:07:54,031
She say what she wants.
She does what she wants.

978
01:07:54,370 --> 01:07:55,962
True existentialist.

979
01:07:56,872 --> 01:08:01,707
Hero worship, bought with a kiss
and an extravagant tip.

980
01:08:02,678 --> 01:08:04,612
She's a fraud, I tell you.

981
01:08:04,713 --> 01:08:08,911
<i>Look what eating sauerkraut has done
to your heart, Fräulein Gunther.</i>

982
01:08:23,899 --> 01:08:25,662
- Mr. Kragen.
- How are you?

983
01:08:25,768 --> 01:08:26,826
Good.

984
01:08:27,670 --> 01:08:30,468
Do me a favor. Georgia Byrd...

985
01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:35,639
just find out where she's from,
what she does.

986
01:08:36,245 --> 01:08:38,577
- Quietly.
- Of course, Mr. Kragen.

987
01:08:44,282 --> 01:08:48,981
Prince Dominic comes tonight.
He's insisted on my venison roast.

988
01:08:49,720 --> 01:08:51,347
A prince? A real prince?

989
01:08:51,456 --> 01:08:54,323
They have a charity dinner in town...

990
01:08:54,459 --> 01:08:56,723
where everybody gets to feel generous.

991
01:08:58,029 --> 01:09:00,361
I tell you, these people are all alike.

992
01:09:12,643 --> 01:09:14,941
Yes, you know, I tell you,
they are all alike.

993
01:09:15,046 --> 01:09:16,809
Oh, people are not as bad as you think.

994
01:09:16,914 --> 01:09:19,678
No, you're wrong, Georgia,
you're wrong. They are.

995
01:09:20,117 --> 01:09:24,315
Like Kragen at the hotel
who looks for life everlasting...

996
01:09:24,422 --> 01:09:27,983
in a tablespoon of extra-virgin olive oil,
you know.

997
01:09:32,897 --> 01:09:34,228
You know...

998
01:09:35,433 --> 01:09:39,233
you and I, we know the secret of life.

999
01:09:39,737 --> 01:09:41,295
Well, what is that?

1000
01:09:41,439 --> 01:09:44,738
The secret of life is butter.

1001
01:09:46,043 --> 01:09:48,477
Butter? Don't tell nobody.

1002
01:09:49,580 --> 01:09:51,241
- Butter, huh?
- Butter, yes!

1003
01:09:52,283 --> 01:09:54,478
<i>Three cases of écrevisses.</i>

1004
01:09:55,453 --> 01:09:56,579
Hotel.

1005
01:10:50,975 --> 01:10:54,206
- Georgia, there you are.
- We were worried you checked out.

1006
01:10:54,312 --> 01:10:56,371
- No, not quite yet.
- Are you gonna join us for Smokey?

1007
01:10:56,480 --> 01:10:58,539
- Kragen's got it all arranged.
- No, I don't think so.

1008
01:10:58,649 --> 01:11:00,674
I'm a little lightheaded
from all that rich food.

1009
01:11:00,785 --> 01:11:03,754
Come on, Georgia, you have to join us
for some gambling.

1010
01:11:03,854 --> 01:11:05,651
Look, I just think I want to...

1011
01:11:05,756 --> 01:11:07,849
Yeah, well, you look exhausted
from all the heroics.

1012
01:11:07,959 --> 01:11:09,688
You probably just wanna take it easy.

1013
01:11:09,794 --> 01:11:13,093
Oh, no, come on, Georgia.
It won't be half as much fun without you.

1014
01:11:13,197 --> 01:11:15,631
I don't know how much fun
it's gonna be. It's a charity event.

1015
01:11:15,733 --> 01:11:18,361
Oh, it'll be a great time and Georgia
can help us liven up the evening.

1016
01:11:18,469 --> 01:11:20,061
- It's gonna be great.
- Great time. Great time.

1017
01:11:20,171 --> 01:11:21,729
Great time had by all.

1018
01:11:21,839 --> 01:11:23,739
- Fine, fine.
- Good, it's settled then.

1019
01:11:23,841 --> 01:11:26,105
Smokey Robinson.
You can't miss Smokey.

1020
01:11:26,210 --> 01:11:27,768
Just take a little nap.

1021
01:11:31,048 --> 01:11:34,950
<i>If you're reading this letter,
my disease has run its course.</i>

1022
01:11:37,521 --> 01:11:40,081
<i>Enclosed is some money for my burial.</i>

1023
01:11:43,561 --> 01:11:45,654
<i>I would like to be cremated.</i>

1024
01:11:46,297 --> 01:11:48,492
<i>Spent my whole life in a box.</i>

1025
01:11:49,367 --> 01:11:51,733
<i>I don't want to be buried in one.</i>

1026
01:11:55,640 --> 01:11:57,631
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
because of turbulence...</i>

1027
01:11:57,742 --> 01:11:59,607
<i>the captain has turned on
the "fasten seat belt" sign.</i>

1028
01:11:59,710 --> 01:12:00,677
Excuse me.

1029
01:12:00,778 --> 01:12:01,767
<i>Please return to your seats
and remain seated...</i>

1030
01:12:01,879 --> 01:12:05,110
<i>with your seat belt fastened
while the sign is illuminated.</i>

1031
01:12:06,150 --> 01:12:07,481
Scared of flying?

1032
01:12:09,487 --> 01:12:12,752
- Do I look scared to you?
- I used to be scared, too.

1033
01:12:14,125 --> 01:12:15,956
It helps if you color.

1034
01:12:25,436 --> 01:12:28,098
Georgia, whatever you got,
give me some.

1035
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:30,940
Believe me, you don't want it.

1036
01:12:31,409 --> 01:12:32,706
Place your bets.

1037
01:12:32,810 --> 01:12:34,004
Don't know where to go.

1038
01:12:34,111 --> 01:12:36,705
I'm following you wherever you go.

1039
01:12:36,814 --> 01:12:40,045
That's a lunatic bet.
That's just a lunatic bet right there.

1040
01:12:40,151 --> 01:12:42,278
Georgia, that's a lot of money.

1041
01:12:42,386 --> 01:12:43,478
I know, huh?

1042
01:12:43,587 --> 01:12:45,851
- You always bet on black, baby.
- Yeah?

1043
01:12:45,956 --> 01:12:48,550
- Yes.
- All right. I'll give that a try.

1044
01:12:52,229 --> 01:12:54,629
- No more bets.
- Matthew, Matthew...

1045
01:12:54,732 --> 01:12:57,292
doing it your own way.
Georgia's our Lady Luck tonight.

1046
01:12:57,401 --> 01:12:58,766
Come on, 17.

1047
01:13:00,471 --> 01:13:01,631
Come on, 17.

1048
01:13:01,739 --> 01:13:03,468
- Here we go.
- There it goes.

1049
01:13:04,842 --> 01:13:07,709
- 17 black.
- Yeah!

1050
01:13:10,448 --> 01:13:12,848
- That's the ball over there.
- Where to next, lucky?

1051
01:13:12,950 --> 01:13:14,474
- What was that number I just played?
- 17.

1052
01:13:14,585 --> 01:13:16,416
Seventeen. Sounds good to me.

1053
01:13:16,520 --> 01:13:18,954
Isn't it a bit reckless
to bet on the same number twice?

1054
01:13:19,056 --> 01:13:22,321
I guess that's why they call it gambling
and not crocheting.

1055
01:13:23,027 --> 01:13:24,289
Gambling it is.

1056
01:13:24,495 --> 01:13:26,725
- Well, the house is loving you guys.
- I'm in.

1057
01:13:26,831 --> 01:13:28,560
- Place your bets.
- Me, too.

1058
01:13:29,266 --> 01:13:31,700
Here we go, here we go,
here we go. Red.

1059
01:13:33,270 --> 01:13:34,703
No more bets.

1060
01:13:35,206 --> 01:13:37,299
- Come on, show me something.
- Come on, 17.

1061
01:13:37,408 --> 01:13:39,638
- Come on.
- Big money, big money!

1062
01:13:39,744 --> 01:13:42,178
- Come on, come on, come on.
- Red, come on.

1063
01:13:43,247 --> 01:13:44,475
17 black!

1064
01:13:45,082 --> 01:13:46,413
- What?
- Yes!

1065
01:13:46,851 --> 01:13:48,512
Oh, my Lord!

1066
01:13:49,720 --> 01:13:51,654
Give me a little kickback over here.

1067
01:13:53,390 --> 01:13:54,687
- Thank you.
- Wow.

1068
01:13:54,792 --> 01:13:56,623
<i>Mesdames et messieurs,
place your bets.</i>

1069
01:13:56,727 --> 01:13:58,752
Place it, place it.
What are we doin' here?

1070
01:13:58,863 --> 01:14:00,490
I'm going with 17.

1071
01:14:00,931 --> 01:14:02,592
Georgia, you can't go there a third time.

1072
01:14:02,733 --> 01:14:03,722
A third time? Come on!

1073
01:14:03,834 --> 01:14:06,029
Come over here
and get some of this luck.

1074
01:14:06,137 --> 01:14:08,128
Maybe I am pushing it a little bit.

1075
01:14:08,239 --> 01:14:09,706
I was born on the 13th.

1076
01:14:09,807 --> 01:14:11,502
Thirteen, thirteen.
Put this on the thirteen.

1077
01:14:11,609 --> 01:14:13,099
You sure about that?

1078
01:14:13,744 --> 01:14:16,736
But then again,
I lost my mama when I was 11.

1079
01:14:16,847 --> 01:14:18,781
Good idea.
Double me up. Double me up.

1080
01:14:18,883 --> 01:14:21,181
Eleven. Yeah. Thank you. Eleven.

1081
01:14:22,086 --> 01:14:25,180
- I love my mama.
- Could you please just place the bet?

1082
01:14:25,589 --> 01:14:28,183
But my mama was born on the 17th.
What am I doing?

1083
01:14:28,292 --> 01:14:31,887
- Oh, come on, bet!
- Wherever you're going, I'm following.

1084
01:14:31,996 --> 01:14:33,190
No more bets.

1085
01:14:33,297 --> 01:14:34,321
Thank you.

1086
01:14:38,836 --> 01:14:41,669
- Here we go!
- Come on, come on.

1087
01:14:43,307 --> 01:14:44,899
- Come on, come on.
- Come on, come on.

1088
01:14:45,009 --> 01:14:46,874
Come on, please, 17. 17. 17.

1089
01:14:48,913 --> 01:14:50,141
17 black.

1090
01:14:50,815 --> 01:14:51,873
What?

1091
01:14:52,183 --> 01:14:53,377
Georgia!

1092
01:14:59,824 --> 01:15:02,952
Great. Now you change my luck
for the better?

1093
01:15:04,528 --> 01:15:06,519
You know what?
I'm not playing with you no more.

1094
01:15:06,630 --> 01:15:09,724
- Can I cash in my chips, please?
- Yes, I'd like to cash in mine, as well.

1095
01:15:09,834 --> 01:15:11,699
And me, too. Thank you.

1096
01:15:15,706 --> 01:15:16,695
Gosh, how much?

1097
01:15:16,807 --> 01:15:21,676
That's 3,546,305 crowns.

1098
01:15:21,779 --> 01:15:22,803
Wow.

1099
01:15:23,948 --> 01:15:27,850
- How much would you guess that is?
- That's about $100,000.

1100
01:15:28,886 --> 01:15:29,875
Wow!

1101
01:16:13,464 --> 01:16:15,056
Not very well-traveled.

1102
01:16:20,504 --> 01:16:22,335
Sales associate?

1103
01:16:22,740 --> 01:16:26,676
I wonder if your new friends would be
so impressed if they knew the truth.

1104
01:17:23,200 --> 01:17:24,963
<i>Oh, mademoiselle...</i>

1105
01:17:41,952 --> 01:17:46,321
You were incredible tonight.
You amazed us all.

1106
01:17:47,324 --> 01:17:48,882
And myself, too.

1107
01:17:49,526 --> 01:17:53,394
So, how is it the two of us never
bumped into each other back home?

1108
01:17:53,497 --> 01:17:56,091
Probably because you're not home
that much anymore.

1109
01:17:56,200 --> 01:17:58,430
Well, Washington
is a hard place to resist.

1110
01:17:58,535 --> 01:18:00,799
Come visit me sometime. You'll see.

1111
01:18:00,938 --> 01:18:04,601
I'm sorry,
but I just can't seem to get past...

1112
01:18:04,708 --> 01:18:08,144
that big flashing "for sale" sign
on your forehead.

1113
01:18:08,245 --> 01:18:11,180
- What are you talking about?
- You know what I'm talking about.

1114
01:18:11,281 --> 01:18:13,442
What are you doing here with Kragen?

1115
01:18:13,550 --> 01:18:16,314
I mean, what exactly is it
that you two do for each other?

1116
01:18:16,420 --> 01:18:20,186
I'm helping him over some regulatory
hurdles in committee, that's all.

1117
01:18:20,290 --> 01:18:23,316
Well, it seems like you should be
helping some of your own people...

1118
01:18:23,427 --> 01:18:24,826
over some hurdles.

1119
01:18:24,928 --> 01:18:26,486
I mean, precious little's happened...

1120
01:18:26,597 --> 01:18:29,498
with that Community Redevelopment
Program of yours.

1121
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:33,468
And nothing ever will happen with
that youth center unless I get re-elected.

1122
01:18:33,570 --> 01:18:37,336
Having generous supporters
like Matthew Kragen is a political reality.

1123
01:18:37,574 --> 01:18:39,041
Yeah, well...

1124
01:18:39,943 --> 01:18:41,535
I'm sorry, but...

1125
01:18:43,180 --> 01:18:47,241
I only have time for reality realities.
Good night.

1126
01:18:49,753 --> 01:18:51,220
Good night, Georgia.

1127
01:18:58,462 --> 01:19:02,762
<i>Mademoiselle Byrd, I hear you were
the highlight at the casino tonight.</i>

1128
01:19:04,234 --> 01:19:07,397
- I don't know about that.
- But there's no need to be humble.

1129
01:19:07,504 --> 01:19:09,699
Did you have a marvelous time?

1130
01:19:10,541 --> 01:19:12,566
Why're you being so nice to me?

1131
01:19:12,676 --> 01:19:16,544
Yeah, I know. I'm a bitch.
At least that's what people tell me.

1132
01:19:17,281 --> 01:19:18,543
Oh, Miss Gunther...

1133
01:19:18,649 --> 01:19:21,584
no, you're not. You're just like
a lot of women who work too hard.

1134
01:19:21,685 --> 01:19:23,949
And yet you are always so kind.

1135
01:19:24,855 --> 01:19:28,086
You are a woman of distinction
and courage.

1136
01:19:29,726 --> 01:19:32,320
Yeah, apparently I am, all of a sudden.

1137
01:19:32,863 --> 01:19:35,423
Wish it had happened a little sooner.

1138
01:19:39,970 --> 01:19:41,130
Miss Gunther.

1139
01:19:41,505 --> 01:19:43,370
I hope you're not trying
to make a pass at me...

1140
01:19:43,474 --> 01:19:45,942
'cause I really can't handle that
right now.

1141
01:19:46,743 --> 01:19:50,770
Please don't die, Miss Byrd.
I read the note.

1142
01:19:52,015 --> 01:19:55,746
- You went through my stuff?
- Oh, yeah, I go through everyone's stuff.

1143
01:19:55,986 --> 01:19:57,385
I apologize.

1144
01:19:59,823 --> 01:20:01,688
Well, to tell you the truth,
I'm kind of relieved...

1145
01:20:01,792 --> 01:20:03,851
to have somebody to share it with.

1146
01:20:04,528 --> 01:20:08,259
Don't worry, I'll be with you here
to the very end.

1147
01:20:13,003 --> 01:20:15,870
I don't know if I want to be here
to the very end.

1148
01:20:15,973 --> 01:20:18,840
Why are you here
with these terrible people?

1149
01:20:19,843 --> 01:20:21,970
You should be with people you love.

1150
01:20:23,814 --> 01:20:26,282
Yeah, I've been thinking
about that myself.

1151
01:20:27,284 --> 01:20:28,911
One in particular.

1152
01:20:30,821 --> 01:20:32,880
It's time I go home and find him.

1153
01:20:45,002 --> 01:20:46,264
Thank you, God.

1154
01:21:49,933 --> 01:21:51,696
That's a lot of snow.

1155
01:21:57,874 --> 01:22:00,206
- What's going on here?
- It's an avalanche.

1156
01:22:00,310 --> 01:22:02,972
I'm sorry, but we'll have to go back.

1157
01:22:03,080 --> 01:22:05,913
I can't believe this happened
on New Year's Eve.

1158
01:22:06,016 --> 01:22:09,042
You're just not gonna cut me
any slack at all, are you?

1159
01:22:11,655 --> 01:22:13,623
You're telling me there's nothing else?

1160
01:22:13,724 --> 01:22:17,751
- I wanted you to find out everything...
- As I told you before, nothing.

1161
01:22:18,829 --> 01:22:20,922
- Nothing?
- Nothing out of the ordinary.

1162
01:22:21,031 --> 01:22:23,192
Except that she is a saint.

1163
01:22:23,867 --> 01:22:25,926
- And from New Orleans.
- Yes.

1164
01:22:27,004 --> 01:22:30,201
- And her occupation?
- You should know. She works for you.

1165
01:22:30,507 --> 01:22:32,600
- Now, please.
- Wait, wait, wait.

1166
01:22:32,709 --> 01:22:35,439
- She works for me?
- That's all I know and all I'm telling.

1167
01:22:35,545 --> 01:22:37,035
Here's your tip back.

1168
01:22:45,822 --> 01:22:47,949
At this rate,
we're going to be here all night.

1169
01:22:48,058 --> 01:22:51,459
Oh, no, we are not.
We are going back down the mountain.

1170
01:22:52,029 --> 01:22:54,463
I prefer to spend the night with my wife.

1171
01:22:58,769 --> 01:23:01,101
Hey, what are you doing?

1172
01:23:02,239 --> 01:23:06,141
- Are you crazy? It's dangerous.
- Yeah, I know.

1173
01:23:06,543 --> 01:23:09,034
But I don't have much time.
Keep the change.

1174
01:23:10,547 --> 01:23:11,741
Wish me luck.

1175
01:23:34,271 --> 01:23:35,636
I hate snow.

1176
01:23:38,241 --> 01:23:39,799
Snow sucks.

1177
01:23:43,213 --> 01:23:45,613
Cookware? Are you sure?

1178
01:24:14,644 --> 01:24:17,545
I heard you were a little shorthanded
because of this avalanche.

1179
01:24:17,647 --> 01:24:20,514
I just thought I'd check
to see if you needed any help.

1180
01:24:20,617 --> 01:24:22,983
But I don't want to get in your way
or nothing.

1181
01:24:23,086 --> 01:24:25,782
No, no, no, it would be an honor,
a privilege.

1182
01:24:28,625 --> 01:24:30,058
What is this?

1183
01:24:31,261 --> 01:24:32,728
It's a turnip.

1184
01:24:33,397 --> 01:24:36,161
No, it's not. That can't be no turnip.

1185
01:24:37,267 --> 01:24:40,896
The poor baby turnips.
Nobody likes them, you know?

1186
01:24:41,671 --> 01:24:42,638
Of course.

1187
01:24:42,739 --> 01:24:45,833
Life is easy if you are a truffle
or a shiitake mushroom.

1188
01:24:46,176 --> 01:24:48,872
But the turnip is to be loved...

1189
01:24:49,613 --> 01:24:52,673
because she's a self-made woman
of vegetables.

1190
01:24:52,783 --> 01:24:55,911
All the others you can only destroy
with cooking.

1191
01:24:56,119 --> 01:24:58,815
But the turnip, she gets better.

1192
01:24:59,589 --> 01:25:02,183
So, you see, it's not how you start...

1193
01:25:06,329 --> 01:25:08,024
but how you finish.

1194
01:25:11,668 --> 01:25:13,158
That's gonna be good!

1195
01:25:14,571 --> 01:25:16,630
The first time I saw you...

1196
01:25:16,907 --> 01:25:21,241
I was so happy
to see your appetite for food...

1197
01:25:22,646 --> 01:25:23,874
for life.

1198
01:25:29,686 --> 01:25:31,119
I'm so sorry.

1199
01:25:32,355 --> 01:25:33,549
Gunther.

1200
01:25:37,160 --> 01:25:38,752
Does anybody else know?

1201
01:25:40,030 --> 01:25:41,054
No.

1202
01:25:42,165 --> 01:25:43,223
Okay.

1203
01:25:43,834 --> 01:25:46,928
Well, good.
Let's not say anything, all right?

1204
01:25:47,871 --> 01:25:50,135
Let's just... Let's just cook.

1205
01:25:53,944 --> 01:25:56,105
The onions, they make me cry.

1206
01:27:52,629 --> 01:27:55,189
You have been very lucky.

1207
01:27:57,867 --> 01:28:00,768
Well, you didn't get everything
you wanted...

1208
01:28:00,971 --> 01:28:02,302
but you have...

1209
01:28:06,710 --> 01:28:09,702
Next time, we do things different.

1210
01:28:10,280 --> 01:28:13,181
We will laugh more, we'll love more.

1211
01:28:15,085 --> 01:28:16,814
We'll see the world.

1212
01:28:17,821 --> 01:28:19,880
We just won't be so afraid.

1213
01:28:27,797 --> 01:28:29,287
Happy New Year.

1214
01:28:34,704 --> 01:28:36,069
Look at you.

1215
01:29:00,063 --> 01:29:03,931
Now, see, look at these tumors.
Georgia Byrd, Mr. Smith, and mine.

1216
01:29:04,067 --> 01:29:06,262
Now there's no way,
even if we all had it...

1217
01:29:06,369 --> 01:29:08,701
that they would be
exactly in the same place.

1218
01:29:08,805 --> 01:29:12,206
So, I said to myself, "Rabindranath,
it has to be the machine."

1219
01:29:14,411 --> 01:29:15,776
Oh, my God.

1220
01:29:30,326 --> 01:29:31,816
Thanks. I'll see you.

1221
01:29:34,297 --> 01:29:36,527
Excuse me, young man,
do you live here?

1222
01:29:36,633 --> 01:29:37,861
Yeah, I live right here.

1223
01:29:37,967 --> 01:29:41,130
- Please tell me you know Georgia Byrd.
- Yeah, I know Georgia.

1224
01:29:41,237 --> 01:29:42,135
Thank you.

1225
01:29:45,108 --> 01:29:47,235
Tonight I'd like to make a toast...

1226
01:29:47,343 --> 01:29:49,834
to a woman whose presence
has captivated us.

1227
01:29:51,081 --> 01:29:52,639
To Georgia Byrd.

1228
01:29:53,016 --> 01:29:54,608
Well, hear, hear.

1229
01:29:54,718 --> 01:29:55,878
To Georgia.

1230
01:29:55,985 --> 01:29:58,453
Now, who is this fascinating woman?

1231
01:29:58,755 --> 01:30:01,781
It's the question
we've been asking ourselves all week.

1232
01:30:01,891 --> 01:30:05,292
Is she a representative
from a competing boardroom?

1233
01:30:05,729 --> 01:30:09,688
Is she a power broker from the corridors
of our nation's capital?

1234
01:30:10,066 --> 01:30:14,230
Is she a brash
and successful entrepreneur?

1235
01:30:14,838 --> 01:30:19,400
The truth, which I discovered tonight,
will amuse you.

1236
01:30:19,642 --> 01:30:22,941
You see, Georgia Byrd is a sales clerk...

1237
01:30:23,480 --> 01:30:25,414
in my New Orleans store.

1238
01:30:25,548 --> 01:30:27,778
In the cookware department, no less.

1239
01:30:27,884 --> 01:30:30,876
Salary? $29,000 a year.

1240
01:30:31,454 --> 01:30:32,421
Cheers, Georgia.

1241
01:30:32,522 --> 01:30:34,183
- What?
- No.

1242
01:30:35,058 --> 01:30:37,219
Or as we might say back home:

1243
01:30:38,261 --> 01:30:42,254
"Attention Kragen shoppers,
impostor, aisle three."

1244
01:30:44,934 --> 01:30:47,402
Oh, come on. Georgia, is this true?

1245
01:30:52,008 --> 01:30:53,839
Mr. Kragen is right about me.

1246
01:30:54,444 --> 01:30:57,140
I'm just a sales associate
in one of his stores.

1247
01:30:57,914 --> 01:31:01,680
One of the best.
Or I was up until a couple of weeks ago.

1248
01:31:02,318 --> 01:31:05,287
- That's when...
- You owe these people no explanation.

1249
01:31:05,388 --> 01:31:07,788
No, excuse me. I think she does.

1250
01:31:07,891 --> 01:31:10,792
She's had plenty to say
about our behavior all week...

1251
01:31:10,894 --> 01:31:12,623
and the only reason we took it was...

1252
01:31:12,729 --> 01:31:15,220
because we thought
she was somebody.

1253
01:31:15,331 --> 01:31:16,889
Well, I'm sorry.

1254
01:31:17,133 --> 01:31:20,364
I didn't come here to give anybody
the wrong impression about me.

1255
01:31:20,470 --> 01:31:23,405
I just came here to blow
every last cent of my money.

1256
01:31:26,442 --> 01:31:27,704
You see...

1257
01:31:29,979 --> 01:31:31,446
I'm gonna die.

1258
01:31:32,115 --> 01:31:34,583
- Georgia, please.
- Oh, it's okay, it's okay.

1259
01:31:34,951 --> 01:31:36,213
It's all right.

1260
01:31:39,722 --> 01:31:43,123
Yeah, see, I had that same reaction
when I found out...

1261
01:31:43,226 --> 01:31:45,217
I only had three weeks to live.

1262
01:31:45,328 --> 01:31:49,128
I mean, I tried to keep it to myself
for exactly this reason.

1263
01:31:50,266 --> 01:31:52,461
It's a party-killer, ain't it?

1264
01:31:57,874 --> 01:32:00,342
But I did land on that mountaintop.

1265
01:32:01,544 --> 01:32:04,707
And I ended up on the cover
of a ski magazine.

1266
01:32:06,382 --> 01:32:08,577
Don't feel sorry for me, baby.

1267
01:32:09,786 --> 01:32:12,050
Never in my life did I think...

1268
01:32:12,388 --> 01:32:15,186
I would end up
in such a beautiful place...

1269
01:32:15,692 --> 01:32:17,751
doing so many incredible things.

1270
01:32:20,430 --> 01:32:21,488
So...

1271
01:32:23,166 --> 01:32:24,929
I'm sorry if I was...

1272
01:32:25,869 --> 01:32:28,337
maybe a little too honest with you.

1273
01:32:30,039 --> 01:32:33,236
But I wasted too much of my life
being quiet.

1274
01:32:36,779 --> 01:32:38,610
I was afraid, I guess.

1275
01:32:40,016 --> 01:32:41,711
You know how it is.

1276
01:32:42,352 --> 01:32:46,220
You keep your head down
and you hustle and hustle.

1277
01:32:47,323 --> 01:32:49,757
Then you look up one day and wonder:

1278
01:32:49,859 --> 01:32:52,259
"How did I even get here?"
Huh, bro?

1279
01:32:54,330 --> 01:32:58,289
See, some of the things
we care about a lot are pretty worthless.

1280
01:33:00,737 --> 01:33:01,795
So...

1281
01:33:04,007 --> 01:33:06,601
I hope I haven't spoiled your evening.

1282
01:33:08,177 --> 01:33:09,303
And...

1283
01:33:12,081 --> 01:33:13,878
it's truly been my pleasure.

1284
01:33:16,019 --> 01:33:17,509
Happy New Year.

1285
01:33:19,822 --> 01:33:22,313
- Happy New Year, Georgia.
- Thank you.

1286
01:33:28,131 --> 01:33:29,325
Asshole.

1287
01:33:30,967 --> 01:33:33,834
That's a very appropriate sentiment,
darling.

1288
01:33:36,472 --> 01:33:39,873
I second that.
Happy New Year, Matthew.

1289
01:33:46,816 --> 01:33:48,545
Where are you going?

1290
01:33:50,386 --> 01:33:52,752
Well, first I'm gonna find Georgia.

1291
01:33:53,122 --> 01:33:54,919
And then I'm gonna go back to school...

1292
01:33:55,024 --> 01:33:57,219
and I'm going to get
my business degree.

1293
01:33:57,327 --> 01:34:00,626
And then one day, when your wife
finally decides to divorce you...

1294
01:34:00,730 --> 01:34:02,698
and takes half of everything you have...

1295
01:34:02,799 --> 01:34:06,997
I'll only be too happy to help her figure
out exactly how much that should be.

1296
01:35:02,291 --> 01:35:04,316
Marie, what are you doing?

1297
01:35:05,495 --> 01:35:08,293
Has that ceiling
ever made you want to cry?

1298
01:35:11,934 --> 01:35:15,301
What ceiling? Get back to work.

1299
01:35:28,518 --> 01:35:29,815
- Hey.
- Hey.

1300
01:35:30,887 --> 01:35:33,754
Georgia, I just wanted to say
how sorry I am that...

1301
01:35:34,390 --> 01:35:37,291
Girl, it's okay. I know you are.

1302
01:35:38,327 --> 01:35:42,229
I left Matthew.
I'm going to the airport now.

1303
01:35:43,366 --> 01:35:46,028
Oh, well, I don't know if they've cleared
the road yet to the airport.

1304
01:35:46,135 --> 01:35:47,500
- What do you mean?
- The avalanche and stuff.

1305
01:35:47,603 --> 01:35:49,730
Ms. Byrd,
something terrible has happened.

1306
01:35:49,839 --> 01:35:52,171
Matthew Kragen's
jumped out a window?

1307
01:35:52,275 --> 01:35:54,766
Pity, but not yet. He's still on the ledge.

1308
01:35:55,211 --> 01:35:56,235
- What?
- Come on.

1309
01:35:56,345 --> 01:35:57,778
I'll get my jacket.

1310
01:35:59,382 --> 01:36:01,009
What's going... Wait a minute.

1311
01:36:01,117 --> 01:36:03,608
Who? Hey, that's Kragen!

1312
01:36:04,987 --> 01:36:08,787
- What the hell is he doing?
- He does not take rejection well.

1313
01:36:13,062 --> 01:36:14,256
Matthew!

1314
01:36:16,766 --> 01:36:18,563
Matthew, what are you doing?

1315
01:36:30,012 --> 01:36:32,606
- What you doing?
- Thinking.

1316
01:36:33,249 --> 01:36:35,843
- About what?
- Not falling.

1317
01:36:36,953 --> 01:36:39,820
- Oh, no. What's she doing out there?
- Oh, my goodness.

1318
01:36:39,922 --> 01:36:41,549
This is crazy.

1319
01:36:48,164 --> 01:36:50,598
You don't have to be nice to me.
I know I'm a jerk.

1320
01:36:50,700 --> 01:36:52,793
You don't think I know I'm a jerk?

1321
01:36:53,035 --> 01:36:55,526
Oh, so, this is where jerks come
to hang out?

1322
01:36:57,073 --> 01:36:59,598
You're starting to get
a little crowd down there.

1323
01:36:59,709 --> 01:37:00,937
Happy New Year!

1324
01:37:01,477 --> 01:37:04,002
- Wave to the people.
- Happy New Year!

1325
01:37:04,113 --> 01:37:05,637
I can't believe this guy.

1326
01:37:05,748 --> 01:37:07,716
- Happy New Year!
- Happy New Year!

1327
01:37:07,817 --> 01:37:11,309
- They'd like me to jump.
- Well, don't start people-pleasing now.

1328
01:37:12,622 --> 01:37:15,147
Matthew. Come back in here.

1329
01:37:15,258 --> 01:37:18,455
You know you're not gonna jump.
You couldn't even jump off the dam.

1330
01:37:18,561 --> 01:37:20,188
Equipment failure.

1331
01:37:20,897 --> 01:37:23,991
- See? You know...
- Miss Burns, let me handle this, please.

1332
01:37:25,501 --> 01:37:29,631
Mr. Kragen, you know what?
You're really starting to piss me off.

1333
01:37:30,273 --> 01:37:32,673
- Give me that.
- No, no, no.

1334
01:37:32,808 --> 01:37:34,241
Oh, heads up!

1335
01:37:36,546 --> 01:37:38,446
Damn, that is a long drop.

1336
01:37:39,682 --> 01:37:43,982
Look, a guy like you has all the money
and time in the world...

1337
01:37:44,153 --> 01:37:46,553
to turn things around for himself,
you know?

1338
01:37:46,656 --> 01:37:48,749
So, just stop whining and get with it.

1339
01:37:48,858 --> 01:37:50,723
Get with what, exactly?

1340
01:37:51,661 --> 01:37:53,652
I don't know. I mean, I don't have...

1341
01:37:53,763 --> 01:37:56,960
Georgia Byrd's five rules
to how to be a better human being.

1342
01:37:57,066 --> 01:37:59,261
All I know is, if you want somebody
to care about you...

1343
01:37:59,368 --> 01:38:01,962
stop trying to buy and sell them
all the time.

1344
01:38:03,039 --> 01:38:04,199
Do I do that?

1345
01:38:05,908 --> 01:38:07,170
And you know what?

1346
01:38:07,276 --> 01:38:10,973
Get your pasty face off the cover
of your own magazine every month.

1347
01:38:11,614 --> 01:38:14,014
Yep, that's the face right there.

1348
01:38:15,351 --> 01:38:16,477
Every month!

1349
01:38:19,121 --> 01:38:21,885
I can't believe I had somebody like you
working for me all this time.

1350
01:38:21,991 --> 01:38:23,856
Well, I wasn't gonna work
for you forever.

1351
01:38:23,960 --> 01:38:25,484
I had plans, you know.

1352
01:38:25,595 --> 01:38:27,756
Yeah? What were you gonna do?

1353
01:38:28,197 --> 01:38:31,689
Well, nothing big by your standards.

1354
01:38:33,035 --> 01:38:35,833
But I was gonna open me up
a little restaurant.

1355
01:38:36,239 --> 01:38:37,672
Bistro style.

1356
01:38:38,441 --> 01:38:42,241
And, of course, a husband and a family.

1357
01:38:46,616 --> 01:38:48,550
Do you have a boyfriend?

1358
01:38:49,885 --> 01:38:52,149
Well, I wouldn't call him that.

1359
01:38:52,655 --> 01:38:55,783
He works for your company, too.
His name is Sean.

1360
01:38:56,025 --> 01:38:58,084
Georgia!

1361
01:38:59,829 --> 01:39:02,093
- It's starting to happen.
- What?

1362
01:39:02,698 --> 01:39:05,826
I mean, I can hear him
calling my name right now.

1363
01:39:06,502 --> 01:39:09,266
Well, someone actually
did call your name.

1364
01:39:11,774 --> 01:39:12,968
Georgia!

1365
01:39:13,476 --> 01:39:16,240
- Is that...
- Sean, what are you doing here?

1366
01:39:19,181 --> 01:39:20,773
Wait, I'm coming!

1367
01:39:27,189 --> 01:39:29,749
- You are here to see Miss Byrd?
- Yeah, how did you know?

1368
01:39:29,859 --> 01:39:31,224
Lucky guess.

1369
01:39:41,671 --> 01:39:44,139
Do you have the arrivals list
for tomorrow?

1370
01:39:46,676 --> 01:39:50,077
And where is everyone?
I don't have any help upstairs.

1371
01:40:04,360 --> 01:40:06,225
Yeah, I'll take care of this.

1372
01:40:07,263 --> 01:40:08,389
Georgia!

1373
01:40:09,432 --> 01:40:11,400
What the hell? I mean...

1374
01:40:12,435 --> 01:40:13,459
Come on.

1375
01:40:13,569 --> 01:40:14,968
How many people
can get on that ledge?

1376
01:40:15,071 --> 01:40:16,538
Who the hell is that?

1377
01:40:16,639 --> 01:40:18,504
Sean, what you doing here?

1378
01:40:18,674 --> 01:40:22,075
Well, I found out, you know,
about the Lampington's disease...

1379
01:40:22,178 --> 01:40:24,169
and, well, I up and quit my job.

1380
01:40:24,280 --> 01:40:26,339
Well, what would make you do
something like that?

1381
01:40:26,449 --> 01:40:30,146
I didn't feel like I had a future there.
Besides, after you quit...

1382
01:40:31,253 --> 01:40:33,847
I didn't feel like I had a reason
to be there.

1383
01:40:35,391 --> 01:40:38,417
It seemed like there should be
more possibilities in life.

1384
01:40:38,527 --> 01:40:41,894
Oh, no! You done up
and read my Possibilities book.

1385
01:40:42,331 --> 01:40:44,925
Well, what exactly
is a Possibilities book?

1386
01:40:45,034 --> 01:40:48,265
Georgia, I gotta talk to you.

1387
01:40:48,571 --> 01:40:51,005
Okay. Talk to me.

1388
01:40:51,374 --> 01:40:53,842
I can't do it now, here on a ledge!

1389
01:40:54,643 --> 01:40:56,008
Come on now, you're gonna have to.

1390
01:40:56,112 --> 01:40:58,580
I'm kind of in the middle
of something here.

1391
01:40:59,882 --> 01:41:01,474
Well, look, I...

1392
01:41:02,818 --> 01:41:05,946
Georgia, I had all kind of thoughts
running through my mind.

1393
01:41:06,055 --> 01:41:10,389
I should've told you this a long time ago.
I don't know what I thought or...

1394
01:41:10,493 --> 01:41:12,757
It doesn't even matter what I thought.

1395
01:41:15,998 --> 01:41:17,659
I have feelings for you.

1396
01:41:19,034 --> 01:41:21,502
Georgia Byrd, I want to be with you.

1397
01:41:22,405 --> 01:41:26,967
Whether if it's for five minutes
here on this ledge, or 50 years.

1398
01:41:28,944 --> 01:41:32,209
- I like this guy. Good guy.
- Me, too.

1399
01:41:35,084 --> 01:41:37,314
Oh, come on, knock it off.

1400
01:41:37,420 --> 01:41:39,251
Now, why you gonna send him
all the way around here...

1401
01:41:39,355 --> 01:41:41,380
when you know I gotta die?

1402
01:41:42,224 --> 01:41:44,692
- Who you talking to, baby?
- God.

1403
01:41:46,629 --> 01:41:47,755
Hello!

1404
01:41:48,564 --> 01:41:50,088
Oh, God.

1405
01:41:50,866 --> 01:41:53,801
- We're the only ones not up there.
- We should join them.

1406
01:41:53,903 --> 01:41:58,465
Urgent fax to Miss Georgia Byrd
from Dr. R. Gupta!

1407
01:41:58,607 --> 01:42:02,543
You were misdiagnosed
due to a faulty dog scan.

1408
01:42:02,778 --> 01:42:07,215
You don't have Lampington's disease.
You're going to live!

1409
01:42:07,483 --> 01:42:09,781
- I'm not gonna die?
- No!

1410
01:42:09,985 --> 01:42:12,112
- I'm gonna live?
- Yes!

1411
01:42:12,221 --> 01:42:17,056
I'm gonna live! I'm gonna live!
I'm going to live, everybody!

1412
01:42:21,430 --> 01:42:24,331
I hope that doesn't mean you want
to rethink that last statement.

1413
01:42:24,433 --> 01:42:27,129
About the five minutes or the 50 years,
and all that.

1414
01:42:27,236 --> 01:42:28,396
Oh, no.

1415
01:42:29,104 --> 01:42:32,699
Five minutes, 50 years, 100 years,
a million years...

1416
01:42:34,143 --> 01:42:35,337
my whole life!

1417
01:42:39,782 --> 01:42:41,113
All right!

1418
01:42:47,056 --> 01:42:48,250
All right!

1419
01:42:48,357 --> 01:42:50,291
- Can we get off this ledge now?
- Yeah.

1420
01:42:50,392 --> 01:42:52,792
It's colder than a snowman's ass
out here.

1421
01:42:54,029 --> 01:42:56,054
What do you say, Mr. Kragen?
You ready?

1422
01:42:56,165 --> 01:42:59,828
- You had enough of this?
- Yeah, go in inside.

1423
01:43:00,002 --> 01:43:03,438
- Yeah, it's time to get warm.
- Give me your hand. Careful, careful.

1424
01:43:03,539 --> 01:43:04,904
I want to tell you, thank you...

1425
01:43:05,007 --> 01:43:07,703
and I'm gonna make
a lot of changes in my life.

1426
01:43:08,110 --> 01:43:11,637
I'm gonna put somebody else
on the cover of the magazine, too.

1427
01:43:13,749 --> 01:43:16,274
You are funny.
You had me going for a minute.

1428
01:43:16,552 --> 01:43:18,281
You so wrong.
How you gonna do me like that?

1429
01:43:18,387 --> 01:43:20,685
Come on, baby. Come on.

1430
01:43:32,268 --> 01:43:34,828
Yeah, now we go.
Put them crawfish in there, baby.

1431
01:43:34,937 --> 01:43:36,928
How about a little taste? Smell.

1432
01:43:37,606 --> 01:43:39,938
Don't ask me. I'm only here on holiday.

1433
01:43:42,678 --> 01:43:45,010
Yeah, don't be careful now, huh?

1434
01:43:47,349 --> 01:43:50,841
Hey, it's getting crazy out there!
Everybody's arriving.

1435
01:43:53,455 --> 01:43:56,424
- Come on, baby, let's go.
- Go out and see to your friends.

1436
01:43:56,525 --> 01:43:58,322
And I'll take care of the rest.

1437
01:43:58,427 --> 01:43:59,416
- Okay?
- Okay.

1438
01:43:59,528 --> 01:44:02,520
Remember, it's not how you start,
it's how you finish.

1439
01:44:02,631 --> 01:44:03,962
Okay, all right.

1440
01:44:05,234 --> 01:44:06,360
<i>Merci!</i>

1441
01:44:16,278 --> 01:44:20,214
- Welcome. Welcome. Welcome.
- Thank you for coming.

1442
01:44:20,316 --> 01:44:23,217
- Thank you so much for coming.
- Welcome to Georgia's.

1443
01:44:23,919 --> 01:44:26,183
- My baby!
- Tough guy!

1444
01:44:26,522 --> 01:44:28,990
- Who's my little guy?
- Congratulations.

1445
01:44:30,426 --> 01:44:32,724
- Rochelle.
- Thank you. Thank you.

1446
01:44:33,796 --> 01:44:35,127
You did it!

1447
01:44:36,432 --> 01:44:37,831
- I quit my job.
- Thank you.

1448
01:44:37,933 --> 01:44:39,457
You did? Oh, congratulations.

1449
01:44:39,568 --> 01:44:41,593
- I quit my job!
- You should never have had that job.

1450
01:44:41,704 --> 01:44:43,194
- I'm so glad.
- Hi, I quit my job!

1451
01:44:43,305 --> 01:44:46,866
Hi, Mr. Mayor. Hi, Mrs. Dean.
How're you doing?

1452
01:44:46,976 --> 01:44:48,841
- Welcome.
- Come on in to Georgia's.

1453
01:44:48,944 --> 01:44:51,310
Good to see you.
Mrs. Dean, it's a pleasure.

1454
01:44:54,650 --> 01:44:57,175
Congratulations!
Thank you so much for inviting me.

1455
01:44:57,286 --> 01:44:59,982
- Thank you for coming!
- Thank you. Congratulations.

1456
01:45:00,089 --> 01:45:01,716
- She loves you.
- Congratulations.

1457
01:45:01,824 --> 01:45:03,223
Thanks for coming.

1458
01:45:03,325 --> 01:45:04,292
Pleasure.

1459
01:45:05,292 --> 01:45:15,292
