At GCC Northeast,

2
00:00:36,436 --> 00:00:38,802
we have the largest cellular
network in the five state...

3
00:00:38,838 --> 00:00:40,567
Join the fun at Mondo Net.

4
00:00:40,607 --> 00:00:42,541
You get instant access
to your friends...

5
00:00:55,655 --> 00:00:57,919
coast-to-coast connectivity...

6
00:00:57,957 --> 00:01:01,085
...important conversations...

7
00:01:01,127 --> 00:01:04,062
Set your spirit free with...

8
00:01:04,097 --> 00:01:06,657
...services, 24 hours a day...

9
00:01:06,699 --> 00:01:08,564
now you can be
at your computer

10
00:01:08,601 --> 00:01:10,159
anywhere on our network...

11
00:01:45,171 --> 00:01:49,335
has nothing
to do with me, okay?

12
00:03:06,386 --> 00:03:08,877
Are you okay?

13
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:11,857
Yeah. Fine. I'm fine.

14
00:04:11,851 --> 00:04:14,411
Zeigler?

15
00:04:24,063 --> 00:04:25,792
Zeigler?

16
00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:39,001
Excuse me.

17
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:54,092
Zeigler!

18
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:27,624
Zeig?

19
00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:33,932
Zeigler?

20
00:06:15,608 --> 00:06:17,508
My boy hooked me up, okay?

21
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:19,477
I mean, I'm talking, now,
free passwords

22
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:20,672
to, like, over 100 sites.

23
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:22,874
So we're talking... Thank you...

24
00:06:22,915 --> 00:06:24,143
horny coeds,

25
00:06:24,183 --> 00:06:26,947
Japanese girls in bondage
and...

26
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:28,247
what... granny trannys...

27
00:06:28,287 --> 00:06:29,311
Okay, you did not just say that.

28
00:06:29,355 --> 00:06:30,686
I never looked at 'em. Okay?

29
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:32,623
I'm just saying,
I have the passwords...

30
00:06:32,658 --> 00:06:35,092
- He totally looked.
- You know he did.

31
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:37,824
I call it
having access to information.

32
00:06:37,864 --> 00:06:39,695
It's called
having a girlfriend, Stone.

33
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:40,892
You should check it out.

34
00:06:40,933 --> 00:06:42,127
- Damn!
- Wow, that's harsh.

35
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:44,102
Sorry.
Shrink in training...

36
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:45,399
I gotta tell it like it is.

37
00:06:45,438 --> 00:06:47,099
Ha!

38
00:06:51,511 --> 00:06:52,808
Tim!

39
00:06:52,845 --> 00:06:54,813
I'm right here.

40
00:06:54,847 --> 00:06:55,939
What?

41
00:06:55,982 --> 00:06:58,815
Mm! Check this out.

42
00:06:58,851 --> 00:07:00,978
- Oh, he's cute.
- Oh, yeah.

43
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,851
Scroll down...

44
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:04,584
Gay!

45
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:05,852
Absolutely.

46
00:07:05,892 --> 00:07:06,859
What?!

47
00:07:06,893 --> 00:07:08,656
It's a boy-toy,
who saw your name is Izzie

48
00:07:08,694 --> 00:07:10,161
and thought you was a guy.

49
00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:12,357
You need to stop hatin'.

50
00:07:12,398 --> 00:07:13,365
- Oh, I'm hatin'?
- Yeah.

51
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:15,162
Tim?!

52
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:16,498
What?! It's not me!

53
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:17,833
I swear!

54
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,402
Okay, who we shutting down?

55
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:23,841
No one.

56
00:07:23,876 --> 00:07:25,935
No, I just...

57
00:07:26,045 --> 00:07:28,946
thought Josh might call.

58
00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:30,539
He's been avoiding me
for over a week.

59
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:33,711
Our relationship
has been reduced

60
00:07:33,753 --> 00:07:35,050
to text-messaging.

61
00:07:35,087 --> 00:07:36,384
How tragic is that?

62
00:07:36,422 --> 00:07:37,855
Okay, Mattie, come on.

63
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:39,858
I know... I know.

64
00:07:39,892 --> 00:07:42,827
I guess I'm still hoping
he'll just...

65
00:07:42,862 --> 00:07:44,056
figure it out.

66
00:07:44,096 --> 00:07:45,427
You need to let go, okay?

67
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:48,696
You guys have been breaking up
way longer than you hooked up.

68
00:07:48,734 --> 00:07:51,225
If he can't recognize
that you got it going on,

69
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:53,636
then... you don't need
to be involved with him.

70
00:07:53,673 --> 00:07:55,868
Besides, look,
it's raining men right now.

71
00:07:55,908 --> 00:07:57,341
Right, guys?

72
00:07:57,376 --> 00:07:59,503
Yo. Ready to dance?

73
00:07:59,545 --> 00:08:00,739
We could do that.

74
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,611
That's what I'm talking about.

75
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:03,876
- Come on.
- No.

76
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:04,883
- Come on!
- Come on.

77
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:07,408
Have you seen me dance?
It's not pretty.

78
00:08:12,692 --> 00:08:15,183
Good night.

79
00:08:29,742 --> 00:08:31,107
Hey!

80
00:08:31,143 --> 00:08:32,201
Don't... do that.

81
00:08:32,245 --> 00:08:33,234
Oh. Sorry.

82
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,941
I wanted out of there.

83
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:37,209
Thought I'd walk with you.

84
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,911
You live the other way.

85
00:08:38,951 --> 00:08:40,077
I'll take the spiral route.

86
00:08:40,119 --> 00:08:42,553
Plus, you know, single guy,
walking alone, late at night...

87
00:08:42,588 --> 00:08:46,115
Well, thanks.
I'm good from here.

88
00:08:46,158 --> 00:08:47,785
See you tomorrow?

89
00:08:47,827 --> 00:08:49,055
Sure.

90
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:50,255
Okay. Bye.

91
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:14,647
You have two new messages.

92
00:09:14,687 --> 00:09:17,247
First message, 9:37 P.M.

93
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:19,281
Mattie, it's Mom.

94
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:21,088
This is call number three,
honey.

95
00:09:21,127 --> 00:09:24,290
I know you're busy,
but call me back, okay?

96
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:26,821
I miss you.

97
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:30,267
Next message, 10:47 P.M.

98
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:35,070
Mattie, it's Josh. Um...

99
00:09:35,107 --> 00:09:36,574
Never mind.

100
00:09:50,122 --> 00:09:51,487
This is Josh.

101
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:53,185
I'm not here right now.
Leave a message.

102
00:09:53,225 --> 00:09:54,590
Josh, it's Mattie.

103
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:56,117
Pick up.

104
00:09:56,162 --> 00:09:58,153
You haven't returned
one of my calls,

105
00:09:58,197 --> 00:10:00,859
and now...

106
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,800
what's with the weird message?

107
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:29,624
Hey, Iz, are you here?

108
00:10:55,087 --> 00:10:56,987
Ugh...

109
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:28,819
You know you have to get up.

110
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:30,151
You have class.

111
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,249
Get up! Now!

112
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:44,961
<i>Of course there are</i>

113
00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:47,234
<i>other kinds of stalking.</i>

114
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:49,002
There is public stalking.
There is cyber stalking.

115
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:51,509
Each with its
own set of behaviors.

116
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:54,479
What I want to talk about now...

117
00:11:54,513 --> 00:11:58,313
is stalking,
the pathological mind...

118
00:12:00,186 --> 00:12:02,780
...and the other.

119
00:12:02,822 --> 00:12:05,222
Now, the pathological mind...

120
00:12:08,694 --> 00:12:13,757
The pathological mind can only
satisfy its need for the other

121
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:15,960
by consuming the other;

122
00:12:16,001 --> 00:12:18,868
leading, once again,
to great need,

123
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:21,805
and, of course,
the cycle begins again.

124
00:12:21,841 --> 00:12:23,433
Now, what I'd like you to do

125
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:27,537
Friday, in preparation
for the midterm,

126
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:31,949
is write an essay on
what we've spoken about today,

127
00:12:31,984 --> 00:12:33,212
including in it ritual...

128
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:35,277
<i>Come on, Mattie, you know</i>
<i>you're gonna have fun.</i>

129
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:36,982
Chill out, relax.
Have a drink.

130
00:12:37,056 --> 00:12:38,489
- Yeah, but...
- You're gonna come.

131
00:12:38,524 --> 00:12:40,685
We're gonna hang out.
We need this, okay?

132
00:12:40,726 --> 00:12:42,785
I'm gonna call you
right back.

133
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:46,462
Damn. Y'all look good.

134
00:12:49,568 --> 00:12:50,728
A'ight. Check this out.

135
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:51,998
I got all the new joint...

136
00:12:52,037 --> 00:12:54,164
Actually, these last four,
y'all have already.

137
00:12:54,206 --> 00:12:55,696
And then, these five,
right here,

138
00:12:55,741 --> 00:12:57,436
won't even be out
for another month.

139
00:12:57,476 --> 00:12:59,239
Plus, I have some
other ones here...

140
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:01,644
Yeah. You know, you should
just save us a few little

141
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,739
tax dollars and drive yourself
to jail right now.

142
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:04,909
Can I use your car?
And don't forget,

143
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,076
I gotta take you with me

144
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:08,109
because you did buy
some of the stuff.

145
00:13:08,154 --> 00:13:10,918
Oh, and your boy Josh...
genius!

146
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:14,255
For every minute
I use on my cellphone,

147
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:15,760
I get credited for two.

148
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:18,093
It's a beautiful thing.

149
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,825
Excuse me for one second.
What's up?

150
00:13:19,865 --> 00:13:21,662
All right,
we're going to lunch, right?

151
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,759
Uh, actually, I'm gonna
hang here for a bit.

152
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:24,770
But I'll call you.

153
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:25,771
Okay. Um...

154
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:26,829
I'm gonna see you later then?

155
00:13:26,872 --> 00:13:28,305
Maybe.

156
00:14:16,388 --> 00:14:18,720
Josh?

157
00:14:26,932 --> 00:14:28,923
Josh, it's Mattie.

158
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:33,232
Josh?

159
00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:22,852
Oh, shit!

160
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:34,224
Josh.

161
00:15:38,003 --> 00:15:39,698
Hey.

162
00:15:42,574 --> 00:15:44,337
Why don't you answer my calls?

163
00:15:44,376 --> 00:15:47,368
Everyone is worried about you.

164
00:15:55,821 --> 00:15:59,154
Stay here. All right?

165
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:28,617
Oh, my... Josh!

166
00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:33,057
Josh?

167
00:16:43,102 --> 00:16:44,694
Oh, my God.

168
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:25,073
Hello, this is Louise Webber.

169
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:27,874
Leave your name and message
and I'll get back to you.

170
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,812
Hey, Mom. Tag, you're it.

171
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:36,787
Hey, call me as soon
as you get this, okay?

172
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:39,052
Something happened.

173
00:17:42,528 --> 00:17:45,190
I'll just tell you about it
when you call, okay?

174
00:17:46,598 --> 00:17:48,395
I love you.

175
00:18:05,717 --> 00:18:08,277
- <i>Josh.</i>
- <i>Mattie...</i>

176
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,720
<i>Are you there?</i>

177
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:13,554
<i>I'm not me anymore.</i>

178
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:16,425
<i>Something's wrong with me.</i>

179
00:18:31,577 --> 00:18:33,511
<i>I know it's very difficult</i>

180
00:18:33,545 --> 00:18:34,876
<i>for us to talk about loss.</i>

181
00:18:34,913 --> 00:18:37,677
So many conflicting emotions
involved.

182
00:18:37,716 --> 00:18:40,617
This might sound pat to you,

183
00:18:40,652 --> 00:18:42,279
but it is okay to cry, Mattie.

184
00:18:42,321 --> 00:18:44,312
I have.

185
00:18:44,356 --> 00:18:46,221
You have?

186
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:50,118
What, five minutes,
is that all I get, Mattie?

187
00:18:50,162 --> 00:18:51,424
I'm wasting your time.

188
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:53,795
You're not wasting my time.

189
00:18:53,832 --> 00:18:55,527
You're wasting mine.

190
00:18:55,567 --> 00:18:56,591
You're angry.

191
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:58,227
That's normal.

192
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:01,702
Actually,
I'm just late for class.

193
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:04,140
You loved him, didn't you?

194
00:19:04,176 --> 00:19:05,734
And you think it's something
that you did

195
00:19:05,777 --> 00:19:07,039
that might've caused this.

196
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:12,678
The only person I blame...

197
00:19:12,718 --> 00:19:14,208
is Josh.

198
00:19:16,188 --> 00:19:18,019
You sure about this?

199
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:25,456
Fuck...

200
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:27,226
Come on.

201
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,628
Talk.

202
00:19:34,239 --> 00:19:36,799
I don't know why
I didn't see the signs.

203
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:39,936
I should've been there;
done something.

204
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:42,640
Sometimes,
there aren't any signs.

205
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:45,172
This was an intensely lonely
young man.

206
00:19:45,217 --> 00:19:47,117
More than you can ever know.

207
00:19:47,152 --> 00:19:49,279
He was very skilled
at hiding his loneliness.

208
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:50,948
And when he couldn't hide it

209
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:54,459
anymore, he hid himself.

210
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:58,890
Have you ever felt
that kind of loneliness?

211
00:19:58,931 --> 00:20:00,296
Hmm?

212
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,934
Don't worry. I read your book.

213
00:20:03,969 --> 00:20:05,937
I'm not a suicide risk.

214
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:06,938
You psych students,

215
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:09,270
you all have a tendency
to resist self-analysis.

216
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:10,900
Don't.

217
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:12,240
Don't avoid your fears.

218
00:20:12,277 --> 00:20:13,301
Confront them.

219
00:20:13,345 --> 00:20:14,972
You can keep your emotions down
for a while,

220
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,672
but somehow, some way,
they will come out;

221
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:17,977
and they will be
even more painful

222
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:19,846
and more destructive.

223
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:21,910
Do you understand that?

224
00:20:31,296 --> 00:20:32,661
Hey.

225
00:20:32,698 --> 00:20:34,427
You good?

226
00:20:38,704 --> 00:20:41,104
Everything's
going to be okay.

227
00:21:14,139 --> 00:21:15,606
<i>It has to be a virus.</i>

228
00:21:15,641 --> 00:21:17,506
I mean, his computer is
probably still logged on.

229
00:21:17,542 --> 00:21:18,907
It's just hitting
his address book.

230
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:19,968
They said, "Help me."

231
00:21:20,012 --> 00:21:21,274
Yeah, but viruses always have

232
00:21:21,313 --> 00:21:22,644
some important-sounding shit.

233
00:21:22,681 --> 00:21:24,546
I mean, just the other day,
I got one that said,

234
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:25,777
"Urgent, Stone. Read me now."

235
00:21:25,817 --> 00:21:26,977
I mean, that's a natural
occurrence.

236
00:21:27,085 --> 00:21:29,451
- It happens all the time...
- That was from me, you idiot.

237
00:21:29,488 --> 00:21:31,456
Damn.
That was pretty strong.

238
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:35,119
Well, someone should at least
log Josh's computer off.

239
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:39,096
I'd do it, but I don't want
to go back over there.

240
00:21:44,836 --> 00:21:46,804
All right, I'll go.

241
00:21:46,838 --> 00:21:48,396
Thanks.

242
00:22:36,621 --> 00:22:38,248
Yeah...

243
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:26,483
<i>There was something so strange</i>

244
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:28,550
about him
when I went over there...

245
00:25:28,593 --> 00:25:30,060
like he wasn't himself.

246
00:25:31,162 --> 00:25:33,096
But he really wasn't. It...

247
00:25:33,131 --> 00:25:35,929
It was like looking
at a different person.

248
00:25:35,967 --> 00:25:37,457
Why did he do it?

249
00:25:37,502 --> 00:25:39,265
I don't know.

250
00:25:39,304 --> 00:25:43,502
And I think that's
what's driving me crazy...

251
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:45,908
that I didn't see it coming.

252
00:25:45,944 --> 00:25:47,343
None of us did, okay?

253
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:49,813
You know, it's not all on you.

254
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:53,908
Are you still getting
those messages?

255
00:25:53,952 --> 00:25:55,920
Yeah. What's the deal?

256
00:25:55,954 --> 00:25:58,286
Did Stone not get over there?

257
00:25:58,323 --> 00:25:59,847
You know, he didn't even
show up to class today.

258
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:02,086
I haven't spoken to him.

259
00:26:23,148 --> 00:26:24,445
Hello?

260
00:26:24,482 --> 00:26:25,881
Hey, Stone.

261
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:27,714
Hey, Izzie.

262
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:29,413
It's Mattie.

263
00:26:29,454 --> 00:26:31,388
What's up, Mattie?

264
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:32,617
Are you still getting

265
00:26:32,657 --> 00:26:34,648
those messages from Josh?

266
00:26:34,693 --> 00:26:36,126
I haven't signed on.

267
00:26:36,161 --> 00:26:39,653
I've just been kind of leaving
my computer alone.

268
00:26:39,698 --> 00:26:43,657
Did you log off Josh's computer?

269
00:26:45,904 --> 00:26:48,896
Did you turn it off?

270
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:51,966
Are you okay?

271
00:26:53,578 --> 00:26:55,739
I just been kind of down,
you know?

272
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,714
Yeah, I know.

273
00:26:57,749 --> 00:26:59,410
We all are.

274
00:27:43,895 --> 00:27:45,260
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

275
00:27:54,806 --> 00:27:56,501
You here to see the apartment?

276
00:27:57,876 --> 00:28:00,367
Well, take a look.

277
00:28:00,412 --> 00:28:04,542
New paint.
Gonna have new carpet.

278
00:28:07,285 --> 00:28:09,412
You won't beat the rent.

279
00:28:09,454 --> 00:28:11,422
Mm-mm!

280
00:28:12,457 --> 00:28:14,118
The guy who lived here
was a friend of mine.

281
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:16,684
I need his computer.

282
00:28:16,728 --> 00:28:18,457
Computer?

283
00:28:18,496 --> 00:28:19,929
What'd you do with it?

284
00:28:19,964 --> 00:28:22,398
I don't know nothing
about no computer.

285
00:28:22,434 --> 00:28:24,026
His computer was
right over there,

286
00:28:24,069 --> 00:28:25,593
with all the rest of his stuff.

287
00:28:25,637 --> 00:28:27,070
Girl, you better get out
of my face

288
00:28:27,105 --> 00:28:28,197
or I'm calling the police.

289
00:28:28,239 --> 00:28:29,297
Why don't I call the police?

290
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:31,171
All right.

291
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:32,938
All right! Don't get crazy.

292
00:28:34,612 --> 00:28:36,580
For two months,
that boy lived here

293
00:28:36,614 --> 00:28:38,878
- and didn't pay his rent.
- You sold it?!

294
00:28:38,917 --> 00:28:40,612
For two months...
what was I supposed to do?

295
00:28:40,652 --> 00:28:41,914
Who did you sell it to?

296
00:28:41,953 --> 00:28:43,318
Mm-hmm!

297
00:28:43,354 --> 00:28:45,185
Dead cats,
and he done killed himself,

298
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:46,520
and here, now, you
come here bugging me

299
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:47,820
about a damn computer.

300
00:28:58,269 --> 00:29:00,396
You tell him he still
owe me a hundred bucks.

301
00:29:00,438 --> 00:29:02,804
<i>The bank didn't take</i>
<i>his raggedy-ass check.</i>

302
00:29:10,348 --> 00:29:11,872
Dexter McCarthy.

303
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:13,144
What, it bounced?

304
00:29:13,184 --> 00:29:15,652
I guess that doesn't
really matter,

305
00:29:15,687 --> 00:29:17,848
since you bought
a stolen computer.

306
00:29:17,889 --> 00:29:20,016
She seemed pretty honest to me.

307
00:29:20,058 --> 00:29:21,548
Why are you e-mailing me?

308
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:22,685
E-mailing you?

309
00:29:22,727 --> 00:29:24,319
I don't even know who you are.

310
00:29:24,362 --> 00:29:26,592
That computer belonged
to someone I know.

311
00:29:26,631 --> 00:29:28,565
You found his password.
Now you're messing

312
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,261
with the people
in his address book?

313
00:29:30,301 --> 00:29:31,563
That's a really shitty
thing to do.

314
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:32,695
Really?

315
00:29:35,907 --> 00:29:36,931
Come here.

316
00:29:44,082 --> 00:29:45,572
That's not possible.

317
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:48,313
I have a procrastination
problem.

318
00:29:48,353 --> 00:29:50,913
It hasn't been plugged in...
since you bought it?

319
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:53,287
No. Look, stolen or not,
the thing cost me

320
00:29:53,324 --> 00:29:55,349
400 bucks... you want
to get me a refund?

321
00:29:55,393 --> 00:29:57,691
Your boyfriend can have
his computer back.

322
00:29:57,729 --> 00:29:59,924
Keep it.
He doesn't need it anymore.

323
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:01,329
He's dead.

324
00:30:06,337 --> 00:30:07,395
Classic.

325
00:31:25,583 --> 00:31:26,982
What's that?

326
00:31:28,653 --> 00:31:29,950
It's from Josh.

327
00:31:29,988 --> 00:31:33,617
This is his handwriting.

328
00:31:33,658 --> 00:31:35,626
When was it sent?

329
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:36,991
Seventeenth.

330
00:31:37,028 --> 00:31:39,690
That's two days before he died.

331
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:58,242
Keeps what out?

332
00:31:58,283 --> 00:32:00,808
He obviously went nuts,
that's all.

333
00:32:00,852 --> 00:32:01,910
What about Stone?

334
00:32:01,953 --> 00:32:03,045
What about him?

335
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:04,418
Wait, what's up with Stone?

336
00:32:04,455 --> 00:32:05,945
He didn't sound like himself.

337
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:08,390
I can't explain it.

338
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:10,417
Kinda got the same feeling.

339
00:32:10,461 --> 00:32:12,326
The same feeling as what?

340
00:32:14,499 --> 00:32:16,797
As when I was at Josh's.

341
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:23,932
Later on in this broadcast,

342
00:32:23,975 --> 00:32:25,670
we'll show how
you and your family

343
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:27,735
can stay healthy and germ-free

344
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:29,269
at home and in the workplace.

345
00:32:29,314 --> 00:32:33,114
And here's Skip Warren
with a late-breaking story.

346
00:32:33,151 --> 00:32:35,119
A spokesman
for the County Health Department

347
00:32:35,153 --> 00:32:37,451
is calling a recent cluster
of suicides in the city

348
00:32:37,488 --> 00:32:40,582
"tragic and very unfortunate,"

349
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:42,820
and he added that there's
no evidence to suggest

350
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:44,521
that they are connected
in any way.

351
00:32:46,564 --> 00:32:48,998
Hey.

352
00:32:50,068 --> 00:32:51,831
Go on.

353
00:32:51,869 --> 00:32:52,995
It's okay.

354
00:32:53,104 --> 00:32:54,230
Okay.

355
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:55,967
Go ahead, I got it.

356
00:32:57,475 --> 00:33:00,273
How well did you
actually know this guy?

357
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:02,711
- Why?
- 'Cause he was into

358
00:33:02,747 --> 00:33:04,305
some scary shit.

359
00:33:04,349 --> 00:33:06,180
Can I show you something?

360
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:22,626
What are we looking for?

361
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:24,760
You'll see.

362
00:33:26,571 --> 00:33:29,369
So, your friend,

363
00:33:29,407 --> 00:33:31,068
was it an accident?

364
00:33:31,109 --> 00:33:33,134
No.

365
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:34,769
Then what was it?

366
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:38,782
I'm not sure.

367
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:45,853
I thought it was just looping

368
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:48,188
the same clips over and over
again, but it's not.

369
00:33:48,226 --> 00:33:49,921
They don't always
do the same thing.

370
00:33:49,961 --> 00:33:52,452
It's some kind of Web-cam feed.

371
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:56,197
Ah, Bag Man. Watch.

372
00:33:56,234 --> 00:33:57,531
Every time he tries
to take it off,

373
00:33:57,568 --> 00:33:59,695
the image just cuts... it goes
right back to the beginning.

374
00:33:59,737 --> 00:34:01,295
How did this get on there?

375
00:34:01,339 --> 00:34:03,773
All I did was plug it in.

376
00:34:03,808 --> 00:34:05,833
How long have you been
watching this?

377
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:07,367
No, I think the question is,

378
00:34:07,412 --> 00:34:09,437
is how long have they
been watching me?

379
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:18,916
Damn it.

380
00:34:21,526 --> 00:34:23,619
Yeah?

381
00:34:23,661 --> 00:34:26,027
Look, look, man...

382
00:34:28,833 --> 00:34:30,733
Turn it off. Turn it off!

383
00:34:30,768 --> 00:34:32,963
Turn it off.

384
00:34:33,004 --> 00:34:34,904
I can't believe
you showed me that.

385
00:34:34,939 --> 00:34:36,600
It was your friend's computer.

386
00:34:36,641 --> 00:34:38,131
Did he get off on the stuff?

387
00:34:38,176 --> 00:34:41,145
Was he shooting those videos
and selling them on-line?

388
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:42,476
What was he doing?

389
00:34:42,513 --> 00:34:44,538
Josh tied a phone cord
around his neck

390
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:47,142
and hanged himself...
that's what he was doing.

391
00:34:47,185 --> 00:34:50,416
Mattie... Mattie,
don't you think

392
00:34:50,455 --> 00:34:52,582
that your friend having
the video feeds

393
00:34:52,623 --> 00:34:56,320
and then doing what he did
is not a coincidence?

394
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,850
And if those people,

395
00:34:57,895 --> 00:34:59,886
if what they're doing,
if it's real,

396
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:02,365
- if they're all dead...
- You know what I think?

397
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:06,866
I think, no matter what...

398
00:35:06,904 --> 00:35:09,065
Josh is still gonna be gone.

399
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:11,405
I think you need
to go back upstairs

400
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:13,069
and erase his hard drive.

401
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:14,305
I tried.

402
00:35:14,345 --> 00:35:15,869
It won't let me.

403
00:35:18,749 --> 00:35:21,081
I need to move on.

404
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:23,019
I'm sorry.

405
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:29,191
Don't you want to know why?

406
00:36:37,461 --> 00:36:38,689
Hello, this is Louise Webber.

407
00:36:38,729 --> 00:36:40,526
Leave your name and message
and I'll get back...

408
00:36:50,074 --> 00:36:51,871
Oh!

409
00:37:41,058 --> 00:37:42,753
Josh?

410
00:37:42,793 --> 00:37:45,318
Josh, it's Mattie.

411
00:37:45,363 --> 00:37:48,423
Mattie.

412
00:37:48,466 --> 00:37:50,093
Are you there?

413
00:37:50,134 --> 00:37:53,160
I feel all alone.

414
00:37:53,204 --> 00:37:54,330
Josh?

415
00:38:01,412 --> 00:38:02,879
Josh.

416
00:38:02,913 --> 00:38:05,108
Something is wrong with me.

417
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:52,928
<i>I have seen two people</i>

418
00:38:52,963 --> 00:38:54,487
kill themselves.

419
00:38:54,532 --> 00:38:58,332
My psych professor stepped out
in front of a moving bus.

420
00:38:58,369 --> 00:38:59,961
All in the last week.

421
00:39:00,037 --> 00:39:02,528
Have you walked
around campus lately?

422
00:39:02,573 --> 00:39:04,438
Every classroom is half-empty

423
00:39:04,475 --> 00:39:07,035
and no one is talking
about it.

424
00:39:07,078 --> 00:39:09,911
Something is following me.

425
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:12,448
It's in my dreams.

426
00:39:12,483 --> 00:39:14,747
- I saw it on the bus.
- Come on, Mattie,

427
00:39:14,785 --> 00:39:17,015
do you honestly feel
there are ghosts of some kind

428
00:39:17,054 --> 00:39:18,316
walking around out there?

429
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:20,085
I don't know.

430
00:39:20,124 --> 00:39:22,183
But something is wrong.

431
00:39:23,394 --> 00:39:24,588
You're a very smart young woman.

432
00:39:24,628 --> 00:39:26,459
I want you to add this up
for me.

433
00:39:26,497 --> 00:39:28,931
A flu epidemic breaks out.

434
00:39:28,999 --> 00:39:31,695
People are in a weakened state;
they're fearful of each other.

435
00:39:31,736 --> 00:39:33,431
And then add a trigger event:

436
00:39:33,471 --> 00:39:36,872
this coincidental clustering
of suicides.

437
00:39:36,907 --> 00:39:38,772
The e-mail rumor mill
goes into overdrive,

438
00:39:38,809 --> 00:39:41,801
and suddenly people are seeing
strange things in the shadows?

439
00:39:41,846 --> 00:39:42,813
I'm not imagining this!

440
00:39:42,847 --> 00:39:45,782
Why do you think
you came here again?

441
00:39:45,816 --> 00:39:47,283
It certainly isn't
because you thought

442
00:39:47,318 --> 00:39:48,478
that I would agree with you.

443
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:50,544
You knew what my response
would be; you knew that

444
00:39:50,588 --> 00:39:51,612
you needed to hear it.

445
00:39:51,655 --> 00:39:53,179
You can't articulate
what you think

446
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:54,657
is going on out there, Mattie,

447
00:39:54,692 --> 00:39:57,252
because it isn't real.

448
00:40:00,998 --> 00:40:05,162
So what am I supposed to do?

449
00:40:05,202 --> 00:40:06,669
Just ignore everything
I'm feeling?

450
00:40:06,704 --> 00:40:08,228
No. No.

451
00:40:08,272 --> 00:40:10,570
You have to face what you
think is happening out there.

452
00:40:10,608 --> 00:40:12,667
You have to stand ground,
take a good, long look,

453
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:17,044
and you'll see it's not there.

454
00:42:59,677 --> 00:43:01,941
You're not real.

455
00:43:02,012 --> 00:43:04,310
You're not real.

456
00:43:21,632 --> 00:43:22,826
Stone?

457
00:43:45,589 --> 00:43:47,989
- I don't want to die!
- Stone...

458
00:43:48,092 --> 00:43:50,390
I don't want to do it myself.

459
00:43:50,427 --> 00:43:51,155
S-S...

460
00:43:51,195 --> 00:43:53,959
I don't want to die!

461
00:43:53,998 --> 00:43:56,990
- Stone! What's happening!
- I don't want to die!

462
00:43:57,034 --> 00:43:59,662
I don't want to do it myself!

463
00:43:59,703 --> 00:44:01,295
Stone!

464
00:47:29,646 --> 00:47:32,410
Oh, my God!

465
00:47:44,962 --> 00:47:47,396
I'm ready to know.

466
00:47:47,431 --> 00:47:49,262
What did you find?

467
00:47:49,299 --> 00:47:51,130
Well, his hard drive
was fried,

468
00:47:51,168 --> 00:47:54,331
but I was able to retrieve
most of the shit off of it.

469
00:47:54,371 --> 00:47:55,303
Apparently your boy's

470
00:47:55,339 --> 00:47:57,603
into stockpiling some
pretty serious viruses.

471
00:47:57,641 --> 00:47:58,573
Why would he do that?

472
00:47:58,609 --> 00:47:59,576
It's a power trip.

473
00:48:00,444 --> 00:48:02,207
It's like keeping nukes
in your closet.

474
00:48:02,246 --> 00:48:04,441
I found some other stuff that

475
00:48:04,481 --> 00:48:05,778
I think you need to see.

476
00:48:05,816 --> 00:48:09,252
When I booted the drive,
this is what came up.

477
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:14,023
Josh?

478
00:48:14,057 --> 00:48:15,854
This message is
for Douglas Zeigler.

479
00:48:15,893 --> 00:48:18,760
I'm Josh Ockmann, I'm the guy
who hacked into your system.

480
00:48:18,795 --> 00:48:23,255
I'm sorry...
but now I got to talk to you.

481
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:25,768
He kept a video diary?

482
00:48:25,802 --> 00:48:27,633
It's more like a play-by-play.

483
00:48:27,671 --> 00:48:30,299
Zeigler, it's Josh again.

484
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:33,275
How can I convince you
to talk to me?

485
00:48:33,310 --> 00:48:35,278
Whatever you had locked up
in your system,

486
00:48:35,312 --> 00:48:36,939
I let it loose.

487
00:48:37,014 --> 00:48:38,140
I let...

488
00:48:38,181 --> 00:48:40,274
And now I don't know
how to stop it.

489
00:48:40,317 --> 00:48:42,308
You okay with this?

490
00:48:42,352 --> 00:48:44,820
Yeah.

491
00:48:46,123 --> 00:48:48,057
I need to know
what you had in there.

492
00:48:48,091 --> 00:48:49,353
I... I need to know.

493
00:48:49,393 --> 00:48:51,054
I've never seen
anything like it,

494
00:48:51,094 --> 00:48:52,823
but it's burning
through every firewall,

495
00:48:52,863 --> 00:48:54,228
it's frying every circuit.

496
00:48:54,264 --> 00:48:55,697
I need your help.

497
00:48:56,867 --> 00:48:58,960
I bookmarked the rest.

498
00:48:59,069 --> 00:49:00,764
Zeig, I got your e-mail.

499
00:49:00,804 --> 00:49:02,829
I think I figured out
a way to stop it.

500
00:49:02,873 --> 00:49:05,239
I'm writing a virus
that could shut it down.

501
00:49:05,275 --> 00:49:07,937
Meet me at the library
at 5:00 today.

502
00:49:10,914 --> 00:49:13,439
Check this one out.

503
00:49:13,483 --> 00:49:15,610
I saw something in the library.

504
00:49:15,652 --> 00:49:17,711
I can still feel it.

505
00:49:17,754 --> 00:49:20,052
Like it reached inside of me,

506
00:49:20,090 --> 00:49:23,389
like it took something
out of me.

507
00:49:23,427 --> 00:49:24,894
My life.

508
00:49:24,928 --> 00:49:26,691
Why won't you answer me, Zeig?

509
00:49:26,730 --> 00:49:28,527
I need your help.

510
00:49:28,565 --> 00:49:31,728
Goddamn it,
why didn't you warn me?

511
00:49:33,236 --> 00:49:35,033
Is that it?

512
00:49:35,072 --> 00:49:36,369
There's one more,

513
00:49:36,406 --> 00:49:38,931
but...

514
00:49:39,009 --> 00:49:40,601
I want to see it.

515
00:49:41,511 --> 00:49:45,379
It's breaking me down.

516
00:49:45,415 --> 00:49:47,679
I feel like
there's nothing left of me.

517
00:49:47,718 --> 00:49:51,279
I can't think, I can't move,

518
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:54,085
I can't take the pain.

519
00:49:54,124 --> 00:49:56,524
I just can't.

520
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:58,687
I'm not even me anymore.

521
00:49:58,729 --> 00:50:00,162
It's all gone.

522
00:50:00,197 --> 00:50:03,189
I... can't go on.

523
00:50:06,903 --> 00:50:08,894
I'm sorry, Mattie.

524
00:50:11,541 --> 00:50:13,839
I'm so sorry, Mattie.

525
00:50:24,187 --> 00:50:25,552
What if it's all connected?

526
00:50:25,589 --> 00:50:27,921
- What?
- The suicides,

527
00:50:27,958 --> 00:50:30,620
the... Internet people,
the things I saw.

528
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:32,287
The ghosts?

529
00:50:32,329 --> 00:50:34,194
I'm not buying it, Mattie.

530
00:50:34,231 --> 00:50:36,461
Josh thought he saw them...

531
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:39,799
and it messed him up
so bad, he...

532
00:50:41,171 --> 00:50:43,002
...he did what he did.

533
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,974
W...

534
00:50:45,008 --> 00:50:48,102
Okay, what do you think
drove him over the edge?

535
00:50:48,145 --> 00:50:50,113
Josh had some pretty
bad shit going on.

536
00:50:50,147 --> 00:50:52,775
Josh wasn't on a power trip
with viruses.

537
00:50:52,816 --> 00:50:55,478
He saw something horrible...

538
00:50:55,519 --> 00:50:56,918
something like this...

539
00:50:56,953 --> 00:51:00,184
and he wanted to stop it.

540
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:02,191
Hackers do this stuff
all the time.

541
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:05,092
It's a prank.

542
00:51:05,128 --> 00:51:07,494
He got it off the Internet.
Come on.

543
00:51:07,531 --> 00:51:09,055
But it wasn't hooked up
to the Internet.

544
00:51:09,099 --> 00:51:10,930
- The cable was unplugged.
- So?

545
00:51:10,967 --> 00:51:13,094
It came through the Wi-Fi.

546
00:51:13,136 --> 00:51:16,071
Just like Josh said,
he pulled something through...

547
00:51:16,106 --> 00:51:18,802
Pulled ghosts through the Wi-Fi?

548
00:51:18,842 --> 00:51:20,810
It just doesn't make any sense.

549
00:51:20,844 --> 00:51:23,642
It makes all the sense
in the world.

550
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:27,138
Do you have any idea
of the amount of data

551
00:51:27,184 --> 00:51:29,084
that's floating out there?

552
00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:30,984
The amount of information

553
00:51:31,021 --> 00:51:32,249
we just beam into the air?

554
00:51:32,289 --> 00:51:33,347
We broadcast

555
00:51:33,390 --> 00:51:36,655
to everyone where we are,
and we think we're safe?

556
00:51:36,693 --> 00:51:38,126
The whole freakin' city

557
00:51:38,161 --> 00:51:39,992
is going insane,

558
00:51:40,030 --> 00:51:42,464
and we're acting like
it's nothing.

559
00:51:42,499 --> 00:51:44,330
Well, it's not nothing.

560
00:51:44,367 --> 00:51:47,234
It's something
we don't understand,

561
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:49,295
and it is coming for us.

562
00:51:49,339 --> 00:51:51,807
You're freaking us out, man.

563
00:51:51,842 --> 00:51:54,333
It's the end of the world.

564
00:51:54,377 --> 00:51:56,868
That's what it is.

565
00:51:59,883 --> 00:52:01,350
Maybe it's the booze
in your coffee.

566
00:52:04,921 --> 00:52:06,252
What about Zeigler?

567
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:07,916
This whole thing
started with him.

568
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:09,721
He was one of Josh's
hacker friends.

569
00:52:09,759 --> 00:52:11,488
There's got to be
someone at school

570
00:52:11,528 --> 00:52:13,257
who knows how we can find him.

571
00:52:13,296 --> 00:52:16,891
Maybe he knows
what the hell is going on.

572
00:52:40,657 --> 00:52:42,784
...computer virus

573
00:52:42,826 --> 00:52:45,124
is affecting Internet service
worldwide.

574
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:47,653
Authorities are requesting
those of you who do not need

575
00:52:47,697 --> 00:52:49,665
to use your computers,
to shut them down now

576
00:52:49,699 --> 00:52:51,530
to avoid spreading the bug.

577
00:53:31,875 --> 00:53:33,365
Hey.

578
00:53:39,683 --> 00:53:41,776
I'm starting to think
I'm the only one living here.

579
00:53:45,322 --> 00:53:47,950
Is there anything
going on tonight?

580
00:53:47,991 --> 00:53:50,824
I don't really go out much.
Sorry.

581
00:53:55,265 --> 00:53:57,495
Bitch.

582
00:55:32,195 --> 00:55:33,685
"Douglas Zeigler."

583
00:55:36,266 --> 00:55:38,564
Zeigler, the virus is inside...

584
00:55:38,601 --> 00:55:39,727
inside... inside...

585
00:55:48,912 --> 00:55:50,504
Inside?

586
00:55:57,954 --> 00:55:59,854
Are you saying...

587
00:56:50,039 --> 00:56:51,666
...not available for comment,

588
00:56:51,708 --> 00:56:55,200
but we are receiving reports
of... mass disappearances

589
00:56:55,245 --> 00:56:56,940
in other cities, as well.

590
00:56:56,980 --> 00:56:59,608
By all accounts, the crisis
appears to be spreading,

591
00:56:59,649 --> 00:57:02,174
and the federal government
is mobilizing a response,

592
00:57:02,218 --> 00:57:03,913
as more and more law enforcement

593
00:57:04,020 --> 00:57:05,920
and emergency systems
appear to be...

594
00:57:05,955 --> 00:57:08,515
simply shutting dow...

595
00:57:48,364 --> 00:57:51,299
I just wanted
to see you, Mattie.

596
00:57:51,334 --> 00:57:52,562
Tim?

597
00:57:52,602 --> 00:57:55,400
I just wanted to see you.

598
00:57:55,438 --> 00:57:58,373
How are you doing this?

599
00:57:58,408 --> 00:58:00,137
I see you.

600
00:58:05,615 --> 00:58:08,049
Izzie, are you in there?

601
00:58:37,247 --> 00:58:40,045
- This voice mail is no longer
- Hey, I'm looking for Izzie.

602
00:58:40,083 --> 00:58:41,516
accepting incoming messages.

603
00:58:41,551 --> 00:58:42,950
Please try again later.

604
00:58:43,052 --> 00:58:44,349
Message 687.

605
00:59:00,236 --> 00:59:02,067
Isabelle?

606
00:59:09,979 --> 00:59:12,914
Oh...

607
00:59:15,485 --> 00:59:19,546
Come here. Come here.

608
00:59:27,997 --> 00:59:29,931
You'll be okay.

609
00:59:44,647 --> 00:59:47,639
You know what dying tastes like?

610
00:59:50,186 --> 00:59:52,518
Metal.

611
00:59:52,555 --> 00:59:54,648
You don't want to breathe.

612
00:59:54,691 --> 00:59:57,319
Because every time, it's...

613
00:59:59,395 --> 01:00:03,195
...it's more of it inside you.

614
01:00:03,232 --> 01:00:08,101
I want to die but I'm
too afraid to do it.

615
01:00:08,137 --> 01:00:10,071
You're not gonna die.

616
01:00:11,941 --> 01:00:13,568
I <i>want</i> to.

617
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:16,511
What do they want?

618
01:00:16,546 --> 01:00:20,038
They want what they
don't have anymore.

619
01:00:20,316 --> 01:00:22,944
They want life.

620
01:00:24,887 --> 01:00:27,219
They're coming for you, too.

621
01:00:29,158 --> 01:00:31,718
There's nothing
you can do about it.

622
01:00:31,761 --> 01:00:35,959
God, you're freezing.

623
01:00:35,999 --> 01:00:38,160
Wait... here a second.

624
01:00:44,674 --> 01:00:46,198
You have reached 911 emergency.

625
01:00:46,242 --> 01:00:48,107
Sorry, all operators are busy.

626
01:00:48,144 --> 01:00:51,636
Please stay on the line
for the next available operator.

627
01:00:57,520 --> 01:00:59,511
I'm sorry, Mattie.

628
01:01:04,427 --> 01:01:07,089
Izzie!

629
01:01:23,212 --> 01:01:24,975
- Hello. This is Louise Webber.
- Hello?

630
01:01:25,048 --> 01:01:26,982
- Leave your name and message...
- Damn it!

631
01:01:32,188 --> 01:01:33,553
Mattie!

632
01:01:33,589 --> 01:01:34,613
Dexter...

633
01:01:34,657 --> 01:01:36,124
Isabelle's gone.

634
01:01:36,159 --> 01:01:37,251
What do you mean she's gone?

635
01:01:37,293 --> 01:01:39,557
I'm packing a bag.
I'll meet you out front.

636
01:01:39,595 --> 01:01:40,926
I'm on my way.

637
01:02:23,639 --> 01:02:27,735
She was just standing there,
empty...

638
01:02:27,777 --> 01:02:29,677
like she wanted to die.

639
01:02:29,712 --> 01:02:31,270
And she was just nothing.

640
01:02:32,949 --> 01:02:35,144
Just... ash, just this

641
01:02:35,184 --> 01:02:36,173
Mattie, look at me.

642
01:02:36,219 --> 01:02:37,709
...black, floating ash.
- Look at me!

643
01:02:37,754 --> 01:02:40,416
I saw it... the thing Josh was
talking about, it came for me.

644
01:02:41,657 --> 01:02:43,625
- Right after I found this.
- What?

645
01:02:43,659 --> 01:02:44,956
The virus Josh was working on.

646
01:02:44,994 --> 01:02:47,087
I found it taped
inside of his computer case.

647
01:02:47,130 --> 01:02:49,155
Off-line, where they
couldn't get to it.

648
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:52,692
- Will it work?
- I don't know.

649
01:02:52,735 --> 01:02:54,134
But Zeigler will.

650
01:02:54,170 --> 01:02:56,798
You found Zeigler?

651
01:02:56,839 --> 01:02:58,397
We're gonna get some answers.

652
01:02:58,441 --> 01:03:00,341
Yeah.

653
01:03:00,376 --> 01:03:02,776
We're gonna shut it down.

654
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:06,771
We're gonna shut it down.

655
01:03:25,301 --> 01:03:29,067
Mattie... Mattie...

656
01:03:29,105 --> 01:03:30,231
You all right?

657
01:03:30,273 --> 01:03:32,298
Yeah.

658
01:03:34,977 --> 01:03:36,205
Get out of the car.

659
01:03:36,245 --> 01:03:37,837
Get out of the car.

660
01:03:51,060 --> 01:03:53,085
Is he all right?

661
01:03:53,129 --> 01:03:54,790
- Let's go.
- What?!

662
01:03:54,831 --> 01:03:57,265
Come on.

663
01:03:57,300 --> 01:03:59,768
There's nobody in the car?

664
01:03:59,802 --> 01:04:01,099
No.

665
01:04:01,137 --> 01:04:04,971
Come on. Come on.

666
01:04:27,296 --> 01:04:28,786
Don't you move!

667
01:04:28,831 --> 01:04:29,798
What the f...

668
01:04:29,832 --> 01:04:30,821
- Don't come any closer!
- Don't shoot!

669
01:04:30,867 --> 01:04:32,835
Put the gun down!
Calvin, are you crazy?

670
01:04:32,869 --> 01:04:35,394
They're safe, they're not...
they're just kids!

671
01:04:35,438 --> 01:04:36,735
We're not going to hurt you.

672
01:04:36,772 --> 01:04:38,467
Put it down.

673
01:04:38,507 --> 01:04:39,974
We've got to keep moving.

674
01:04:40,042 --> 01:04:41,134
We're wasting time.

675
01:04:41,177 --> 01:04:42,872
We've got to get out
of the city!

676
01:04:42,912 --> 01:04:44,470
They came through the computer.

677
01:04:44,513 --> 01:04:45,605
We saw them.

678
01:04:45,648 --> 01:04:47,741
We think we have a solution.

679
01:04:47,783 --> 01:04:48,977
Are you people insane?

680
01:04:49,085 --> 01:04:51,076
You stay here, you're dead.

681
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:52,781
We shouldn't be out here...
they say it's spreading.

682
01:04:52,822 --> 01:04:54,119
They say
that they don't know how long

683
01:04:54,156 --> 01:04:55,282
until it's everywhere.

684
01:04:55,324 --> 01:04:56,348
The cops are gone!

685
01:04:56,392 --> 01:04:57,882
People are dying
all over the place! Come on!

686
01:04:57,927 --> 01:04:59,258
We heard it's safe
in the dead zones,

687
01:04:59,295 --> 01:05:00,455
anywhere there's no computers,

688
01:05:00,496 --> 01:05:01,690
no phones, no Wi-Fi.

689
01:05:01,731 --> 01:05:02,698
Come on!

690
01:05:02,732 --> 01:05:04,791
Anywhere where they
can't come through.

691
01:05:04,834 --> 01:05:06,597
- Let's go!
- Save yourselves!

692
01:05:06,636 --> 01:05:09,070
Hurry!

693
01:05:16,345 --> 01:05:18,609
What if they got Zeigler?

694
01:05:18,648 --> 01:05:19,945
What if we can't get out?

695
01:05:20,049 --> 01:05:23,246
He's alive!

696
01:05:23,286 --> 01:05:25,982
He's got to be.

697
01:06:00,489 --> 01:06:02,787
Douglas Zeigler?

698
01:06:02,825 --> 01:06:03,883
Zeigler!

699
01:06:08,798 --> 01:06:10,925
Whoa.

700
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,467
My God.

701
01:06:25,948 --> 01:06:27,779
He's not here.

702
01:06:28,918 --> 01:06:32,217
No! You're going
to let them in!

703
01:06:35,591 --> 01:06:37,183
- Who are you?!
My friend Josh

704
01:06:37,226 --> 01:06:38,352
needed to see you. Why?

705
01:06:38,394 --> 01:06:40,555
That's the little prick
who let them in.

706
01:06:40,596 --> 01:06:41,528
Let what in?

707
01:06:41,564 --> 01:06:44,089
The slightest leak,
the slightest hole,

708
01:06:44,133 --> 01:06:45,828
that's how.

709
01:06:45,868 --> 01:06:47,836
We need to know
what you were working on.

710
01:06:47,870 --> 01:06:48,962
What was it?!

711
01:06:49,005 --> 01:06:51,496
It was a telecom project!

712
01:06:51,540 --> 01:06:52,905
It was my baby.

713
01:06:52,942 --> 01:06:54,910
It was super-wide band.

714
01:06:54,944 --> 01:06:57,845
We found frequencies that we
didn't even know existed,

715
01:06:57,880 --> 01:06:59,313
and they came through.

716
01:06:59,348 --> 01:07:01,748
Who did?

717
01:07:05,888 --> 01:07:07,913
We didn't know
what it was at first.

718
01:07:07,957 --> 01:07:11,393
We thought it was
like a radio wave interference.

719
01:07:11,427 --> 01:07:13,395
Then, we realized
that there was a pattern to it.

720
01:07:14,830 --> 01:07:16,320
Every time that we'd try
to monitor them,

721
01:07:16,365 --> 01:07:18,196
they would stop, or they
would change frequencies.

722
01:07:18,234 --> 01:07:20,293
I mean, they were smart.

723
01:07:20,336 --> 01:07:23,203
<i>They were reacting to us,</i>
<i>and then...</i>

724
01:07:23,239 --> 01:07:27,232
<i>we started seeing things</i>
<i>around the lab.</i>

725
01:07:27,276 --> 01:07:29,506
<i>But shadows can't hide</i>
<i>underneath the desk.</i>

726
01:07:29,545 --> 01:07:31,069
<i>Shadows can't walk</i>

727
01:07:31,113 --> 01:07:33,673
across a room
in broad daylight.

728
01:07:33,716 --> 01:07:37,948
There was this tape.

729
01:07:37,987 --> 01:07:39,545
Red utility tape.

730
01:07:39,588 --> 01:07:41,180
Have you seen it?

731
01:07:43,926 --> 01:07:45,553
It must have blocked
part of the spectrum

732
01:07:45,594 --> 01:07:46,959
that they needed
for transmissions,

733
01:07:47,063 --> 01:07:48,553
so we could keep them
out of a room,

734
01:07:48,597 --> 01:07:49,825
but we couldn't keep them out.

735
01:07:49,865 --> 01:07:51,526
I mean, they were coming through
so fast,

736
01:07:51,567 --> 01:07:53,125
it was like a blur.

737
01:07:54,970 --> 01:07:57,734
The last thing you want,
the last thing you ever want

738
01:07:57,773 --> 01:08:00,105
is for them to get to you.

739
01:08:00,142 --> 01:08:04,306
'Cause when they grab ahold,
they take your will to live.

740
01:08:04,346 --> 01:08:05,677
Everything that made you

741
01:08:05,714 --> 01:08:07,443
you is gone.

742
01:08:07,483 --> 01:08:08,780
You don't want to talk,

743
01:08:08,818 --> 01:08:10,115
you don't want to move.

744
01:08:10,152 --> 01:08:13,053
You're a shell.

745
01:08:13,089 --> 01:08:14,852
And then come the bruises.

746
01:08:14,890 --> 01:08:16,380
They spread all over.

747
01:08:16,425 --> 01:08:18,916
Your body dies
right out from under you,

748
01:08:19,028 --> 01:08:22,555
and the next thing you know,
you're just a pile of ash!

749
01:08:22,598 --> 01:08:24,589
I saw it happen to Tillman.

750
01:08:24,633 --> 01:08:27,932
I saw it happen to Plummer.

751
01:08:28,037 --> 01:08:29,095
What are they?

752
01:08:29,138 --> 01:08:30,400
I wish I knew.

753
01:08:30,439 --> 01:08:34,307
I just watched
my best friends die, Zeigler.

754
01:08:34,343 --> 01:08:35,503
That's not the answer

755
01:08:35,544 --> 01:08:36,568
I came here for.

756
01:08:36,612 --> 01:08:40,275
Well, what do you want me
to say?

757
01:08:40,316 --> 01:08:42,511
They've already crawled in
the entire regional network.

758
01:08:42,551 --> 01:08:44,041
Everywhere...
cellphones, Pads...

759
01:08:44,086 --> 01:08:45,485
We can't stop them.

760
01:08:45,521 --> 01:08:47,148
We have to crash
the entire system.

761
01:08:47,189 --> 01:08:49,487
How are we supposed
to crash the system?

762
01:08:49,525 --> 01:08:51,823
This is what Josh
was working on.

763
01:08:51,861 --> 01:08:53,055
A virus configured

764
01:08:53,095 --> 01:08:54,494
to the specs of your system.

765
01:08:55,598 --> 01:08:58,931
Where's your server?

766
01:08:58,968 --> 01:09:01,528
In a highly non-optimum place.

767
01:09:01,570 --> 01:09:03,367
Where is it?!

768
01:09:03,405 --> 01:09:05,305
It's in the basement,
in the computer lab!

769
01:09:05,341 --> 01:09:07,866
It doesn't matter,
because even if you upload it,

770
01:09:07,910 --> 01:09:10,743
it still doesn't mean
that it's going to work!

771
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:15,514
No-no-no-no-no-
no-no-no-no!

772
01:09:15,551 --> 01:09:16,711
No!

773
01:10:09,872 --> 01:10:10,998
Run!

774
01:10:12,808 --> 01:10:14,537
Go!

775
01:10:23,652 --> 01:10:24,880
Come on!

776
01:10:29,225 --> 01:10:30,283
Dexter!

777
01:10:30,326 --> 01:10:31,725
Go!

778
01:13:59,868 --> 01:14:00,835
Mattie.

779
01:14:06,842 --> 01:14:08,833
Josh?

780
01:14:11,914 --> 01:14:12,744
Josh?

781
01:14:16,218 --> 01:14:17,344
I'm sorry, Mattie.

782
01:14:39,541 --> 01:14:40,974
No, don't look!

783
01:14:41,009 --> 01:14:42,874
Just run!

784
01:14:48,750 --> 01:14:50,650
Mattie! Mattie!

785
01:14:50,686 --> 01:14:51,653
Come back to me.

786
01:14:51,687 --> 01:14:53,382
I saw it, Dex.

787
01:14:53,422 --> 01:14:54,389
I saw...

788
01:14:54,423 --> 01:14:55,981
Okay. Stay right here.

789
01:14:56,091 --> 01:14:58,082
I'll be right back.
I'll be right back.

790
01:14:58,126 --> 01:14:59,286
No!

791
01:14:59,328 --> 01:15:00,522
- I have to.
- It's too late.

792
01:15:00,562 --> 01:15:01,654
There's nothing we can do.

793
01:15:01,697 --> 01:15:03,028
I can still
shut the system down.

794
01:15:03,065 --> 01:15:04,760
Don't you get it?

795
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:06,768
There's no system to shut down.

796
01:15:06,802 --> 01:15:07,769
They are the system.

797
01:15:07,803 --> 01:15:08,792
I have to go.

798
01:15:08,837 --> 01:15:10,828
No... no...

799
01:16:17,873 --> 01:16:19,864
It worked.

800
01:16:46,535 --> 01:16:48,969
Let's get the hell
out of here! Come on!

801
01:16:49,071 --> 01:16:51,631
Come on! Run!

802
01:17:11,660 --> 01:17:14,094
Geez!

803
01:17:34,616 --> 01:17:36,106
Hey!

804
01:18:18,293 --> 01:18:20,318
How much gas do we have left?

805
01:18:20,362 --> 01:18:21,920
Half a tank.

806
01:18:21,997 --> 01:18:23,965
How far is that gonna get us?

807
01:18:26,001 --> 01:18:28,401
We're gonna find out.

808
01:19:38,573 --> 01:19:40,165
This is an emergency message

809
01:19:40,208 --> 01:19:41,937
from the United States Army.

810
01:19:42,010 --> 01:19:43,272
Search and rescue units

811
01:19:43,311 --> 01:19:46,075
have been dispatched to assist
survivors of the crisis.

812
01:19:46,114 --> 01:19:47,638
We have established safe zones

813
01:19:47,682 --> 01:19:49,775
in locations without wireless
or cellphone coverage.

814
01:19:49,818 --> 01:19:51,843
Cellphones, computers

815
01:19:51,887 --> 01:19:54,856
and Pads are all conduits
for the invasion.

816
01:19:54,890 --> 01:19:58,257
Dispose of all technology before
proceeding to these locations.

817
01:20:30,759 --> 01:20:32,954
Hold on, Mattie!

818
01:21:09,664 --> 01:21:10,631
You all right?

819
01:21:10,665 --> 01:21:12,223
Yeah. What happened?

820
01:21:12,267 --> 01:21:13,256
I don't know.

821
01:21:23,178 --> 01:21:25,203
We must've hit a dead zone.

822
01:21:27,215 --> 01:21:30,810
They can't exist
without a signal.

823
01:22:09,291 --> 01:22:11,156
<i>We can never go back.</i>

824
01:22:11,192 --> 01:22:13,490
<i>The cities are theirs.</i>

825
01:22:13,528 --> 01:22:16,827
<i>Our lives are different now.</i>

826
01:22:16,865 --> 01:22:19,857
