1
00:01:32,569 --> 00:01:35,613
Security has been tightened.

2
00:01:35,781 --> 00:01:38,492
All borders have been placed on full alert.

3
00:01:38,658 --> 00:01:42,162
Exit visas have been suspended
for the entire week.

4
00:01:42,328 --> 00:01:47,500
In addition, we have assurance
from our undercover agents in the West

5
00:01:47,667 --> 00:01:51,754
that our actions to date
have gone completely undetected.

6
00:01:51,922 --> 00:01:54,633
All military leaves have been cancelled,

7
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,178
and we have doubled the guard
around Dr Flammond.

8
00:01:58,344 --> 00:02:02,140
Finally, all systems are in readiness

9
00:02:02,306 --> 00:02:05,142
for deployment of the Polaris Mine.

10
00:02:05,309 --> 00:02:10,272
- As you ordered, General Streck.
- Well done, von Horst.

11
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,609
By Sunday, the entire NATO
submarine fleet will be here

12
00:02:13,776 --> 00:02:17,321
on their manoeuvres,
and completely vulnerable.

13
00:02:19,072 --> 00:02:23,202
Major Crumpler, what is the progress
of our diversionary plan?

14
00:02:23,368 --> 00:02:27,706
The schedule for the cultural festival
is now complete, Herr General.

15
00:02:27,873 --> 00:02:31,961
You should be pleased to note,
that at your personal request,

16
00:02:32,127 --> 00:02:36,382
the Soviets have agreed to send
their celebrated tenor, Vladimir Biletnikov.

17
00:02:36,548 --> 00:02:41,637
Well done, Herr Major.
Then everything has gone to plan?

18
00:02:41,803 --> 00:02:45,640
Well, not exactly, mein General.

19
00:02:45,807 --> 00:02:50,270
The American, Leonard Bernstein,
unfortunately has had to cancel.

20
00:02:50,436 --> 00:02:53,023
They are sending
another performer in his place.

21
00:02:53,189 --> 00:02:58,111
In fact, we have just received
this copy of his most recent record.

22
00:02:58,277 --> 00:03:02,240
His name is...Nick Rivers.

23
00:03:02,406 --> 00:03:04,826
I'm sure he will be quite adequate.

24
00:03:04,992 --> 00:03:08,287
As long as the world's attention
is fixed on our cultural festival,

25
00:03:08,455 --> 00:03:10,540
no one will know what is about to happen.

26
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:18,381
Once again, Germany will become
united under one rule. Ours!

27
00:03:18,547 --> 00:03:22,634
After Sunday there will be no one
to stop us.

28
00:06:16,347 --> 00:06:17,764
A pen.

29
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:22,603
A table.

30
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:28,066
A table.

31
00:06:29,693 --> 00:06:35,656
The pen is on the table.

32
00:06:42,414 --> 00:06:45,125
There is sauerkraut in my lederhosen.

33
00:06:48,086 --> 00:06:49,878
Come in.

34
00:06:57,678 --> 00:06:59,888
What did he say?

35
00:07:00,056 --> 00:07:02,599
I think we're at the East German
checkpoint.

36
00:07:02,767 --> 00:07:05,269
Better have our passports ready.

37
00:07:05,436 --> 00:07:08,730
This is the first time rock music
has been allowed in this country.

38
00:07:08,898 --> 00:07:13,694
You're not just a performer. You're
an ambassador representing America.

39
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:16,530
And above all, we play by their rules.

40
00:07:16,655 --> 00:07:19,449
Martin, I've been practising.
How's this?

41
00:07:23,661 --> 00:07:26,915
- What does that mean?
- Is your daughter 1 8?

42
00:07:31,711 --> 00:07:34,005
Your papers, please.

43
00:07:39,802 --> 00:07:41,888
Mr Nick Rivers.

44
00:07:42,055 --> 00:07:45,558
We have been awaiting the arrival
of the famous American singer.

45
00:07:58,696 --> 00:08:02,367
- Where are they taking him?
- They are not taking him anywhere.

46
00:08:08,039 --> 00:08:11,750
Do not let your American curiosity
lead you into trouble.

47
00:08:11,918 --> 00:08:16,880
You are a guest here,
only because it serves our purposes.

48
00:08:17,048 --> 00:08:21,551
I suggest that during your stay, it would
be wise to keep to your own affairs.

49
00:08:26,222 --> 00:08:28,392
Good day.

50
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:36,858
What the hell did you say to him?

51
00:08:37,025 --> 00:08:41,780
I just told him I'd put his name
on the Montgomery Ward mailing list.

52
00:08:43,866 --> 00:08:46,784
I'm sorry.
He's just a little tired from the trip.

53
00:08:46,952 --> 00:08:49,037
Normally he wouldn't say...

54
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:54,125
Your attitude is being noted, Mr Rivers.

55
00:09:03,093 --> 00:09:07,805
If that was your idea of being an
ambassador, we're headed for trouble.

56
00:09:54,602 --> 00:09:56,770
I want a schnauzer
with my Wiener schnitzel.

57
00:10:47,528 --> 00:10:50,322
from all over the world as our guests,

58
00:10:50,698 --> 00:10:52,741
we wish to express our appreciation

59
00:10:52,908 --> 00:10:55,369
by offering to you these keys to our city,

60
00:10:55,619 --> 00:11:01,333
which will be presented by our
East German Women's Olympic Team.

61
00:11:21,811 --> 00:11:28,109
Tonight, we begin our Festival
at the Concert Hall,

62
00:11:28,276 --> 00:11:32,531
where the distinguished Madam Bergerone
and her ballet company

63
00:11:32,697 --> 00:11:34,949
will perform "The Nutcracker Suite".

64
00:11:36,659 --> 00:11:41,414
Souvenirs. Novelties. Party tricks.

65
00:11:42,665 --> 00:11:47,253
Souvenirs. Novelties. Party tricks.

66
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,886
Do you know any good white
basketball players?

67
00:11:56,053 --> 00:12:00,182
There are no good white basketball
players, my friend.

68
00:12:00,349 --> 00:12:03,019
There was trouble on the Berlin Express.

69
00:12:03,185 --> 00:12:05,729
They knew I was on that train.

70
00:12:05,896 --> 00:12:10,776
We suspect there is a traitor
somewhere in the Resistance.

71
00:12:10,942 --> 00:12:14,738
We must proceed nonetheless.
There is too much at stake.

72
00:12:14,905 --> 00:12:20,618
Here, kind sir, smell this flower.
It never fails to amuse at parties.

73
00:12:23,913 --> 00:12:27,584
It's very good.
The German's are planning something.

74
00:12:27,751 --> 00:12:29,960
Time is running out.

75
00:12:30,128 --> 00:12:34,090
Have you found out
where Dr Flammond is being kept?

76
00:12:34,257 --> 00:12:38,719
Here, this is one of our most popular items.

77
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:44,058
That's very good.

78
00:12:44,225 --> 00:12:47,895
We do not know
where they are keeping Dr Flammond.

79
00:12:48,063 --> 00:12:51,149
Only that they are forcing him
to build a new weapon.

80
00:12:51,315 --> 00:12:53,985
What are my instructions?

81
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:59,740
Here, try this. This will make you
very popular at social gatherings.

82
00:13:03,661 --> 00:13:07,873
Go tonight to the ballet.
Use this ticket.

83
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:11,752
You will meet the leader of the Resistance,
a man known as "The Torch".

84
00:13:11,918 --> 00:13:14,213
Until then, wait at the Howard Johnson's

85
00:13:14,379 --> 00:13:16,841
on the corner of Der Fuhrer Strasse
and Goebbels Platzen.

86
00:13:17,007 --> 00:13:19,802
Good luck, kind sir, and God be with you.

87
00:13:19,968 --> 00:13:23,638
Wait. You dropped your phoney dog pooh.

88
00:13:23,805 --> 00:13:26,349
What phoney dog pooh?

89
00:13:26,517 --> 00:13:30,395
Souvenirs. Novelties. Party tricks.

90
00:13:32,939 --> 00:13:35,691
And now we conclude our ceremony

91
00:13:35,859 --> 00:13:39,904
with the singing of our
East German National Anthem.

92
00:13:40,823 --> 00:13:44,368
HAIL, HAIL, EAST GERMANY

93
00:13:44,534 --> 00:13:48,371
LAND OF VINE AND GRAPE,

94
00:13:48,537 --> 00:13:52,750
LAND WHERE YOU'LL REGRET

95
00:13:52,917 --> 00:13:56,337
AND TRY TO ESCAPE

96
00:13:56,503 --> 00:13:58,547
NO MATTER IF YOU TUNNEL UNDER

97
00:13:58,715 --> 00:14:01,092
OR TAKE A RUNNING JUMP
AT THE WALL,

98
00:14:01,258 --> 00:14:03,386
THE GUARDS WILL KILL YOU,

99
00:14:03,552 --> 00:14:05,972
IF THE ELECTRIFIED FENCE
DOESN'T FIRST.

100
00:14:14,104 --> 00:14:17,817
Driver, why are we stopped here?
This isn't the Howard Johnson's.

101
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:11,744
Good evening. A table for two, please.
The name is Rivers.

102
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:14,330
Ah, yes. Mr Rivers.

103
00:15:14,497 --> 00:15:20,753
I have it right here, but we require
a jacket and tie for the dining room.

104
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:24,215
We will be very happy
to provide you with one.

105
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:26,300
That'll be fine.

106
00:15:26,466 --> 00:15:28,094
Jurgen.

107
00:15:29,804 --> 00:15:31,723
This way, sir.

108
00:15:34,891 --> 00:15:38,186
General Streck, Comrade Biletnikov.

109
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:42,650
- I have your table ready for you.
- Very good, Heinz.

110
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:46,653
As you know, Comrade Biletnikov
holds a very high rank in the party.

111
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,947
We wish to afford him every courtesy.

112
00:15:49,113 --> 00:15:51,575
But of course, mein General.

113
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:56,954
Perhaps Comrade Biletnikov could be
persuaded to sing for us this evening.

114
00:15:57,163 --> 00:15:59,874
I will take care of it.

115
00:16:06,964 --> 00:16:08,342
Thank you.

116
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:14,973
Nick, I'm sorry I won't be
able to join you for dinner tonight.

117
00:16:15,139 --> 00:16:18,643
I'm coming down with a sore throat.
So, I've decided to turn in early.

118
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:21,061
Don't forget to be at the theatre at 8:30.

119
00:16:23,773 --> 00:16:26,234
- This doesn't help at all.
- Don't worry, Martin.

120
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:29,529
Why don't you get some sleep?
Is there anything you need?

121
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:32,865
No. I just wanted to make sure
you got those new arrangements.

122
00:16:33,032 --> 00:16:35,492
I got them right here.

123
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:41,332
By the way, I ordered that '84 Ripple Blanc
for you that they recommended.

124
00:16:41,498 --> 00:16:43,667
- It's very good.
- Thanks.

125
00:17:12,988 --> 00:17:16,199
Who do you favour
in the Virginia Slims Tournament?

126
00:17:16,366 --> 00:17:20,536
In women's tennis,
I always root against the heterosexual.

127
00:17:20,704 --> 00:17:22,664
Have you heard from Cedric?

128
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:26,417
He was just here. Wait in your hotel
room. He will meet you there.

129
00:17:26,584 --> 00:17:29,629
This letter has to be in New York
by T uesday.

130
00:17:29,796 --> 00:17:32,548
Now, go! Quickly!

131
00:18:07,374 --> 00:18:12,796
I'm sorry, madam, but this evening
is only for guests of the cultural festival.

132
00:18:17,342 --> 00:18:20,054
Your Ripple Blanc, sir.

133
00:18:44,577 --> 00:18:47,497
Jurgen, escort this lady out.

134
00:18:50,667 --> 00:18:54,044
Excuse me, this lady is with me.

135
00:18:54,212 --> 00:18:57,673
Mr Rivers,
a thousand pardons, madam.

136
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:01,928
After you, my dear.
You're just in time.

137
00:19:02,094 --> 00:19:06,015
I don't think I've ever seen you
looking so lovely.

138
00:19:10,602 --> 00:19:14,397
- That was very kind of you.
- My pleasure.

139
00:19:14,565 --> 00:19:17,276
I was looking for someone to dance with.

140
00:19:17,442 --> 00:19:20,571
- You're an American.
- That's right.

141
00:19:20,737 --> 00:19:23,823
- My uncle was born in America.
- Really?

142
00:19:23,991 --> 00:19:26,827
But he was one of the lucky ones.

143
00:19:26,993 --> 00:19:31,998
He managed to escape in a balloon
during the Jimmy Carter presidency.

144
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:35,043
- I bet he's got a lot of great stories.
- Yes!

145
00:19:35,209 --> 00:19:39,547
He would tell me about
the large houses and expensive cars.

146
00:19:39,714 --> 00:19:44,093
How young people waste time watching
television and listening to rock and roll.

147
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:47,055
- What's wrong with television?
- Not all television.

148
00:19:47,222 --> 00:19:49,683
"M*A*S*H" was OK
and the "Mary Tyler Moore Show".

149
00:19:49,849 --> 00:19:54,061
It just seems like young people
of America take freedom for granted.

150
00:19:54,229 --> 00:19:56,273
Wait. I don't think you're being fair.

151
00:19:56,439 --> 00:19:59,818
My history class once spent
an entire week in Philadelphia.

152
00:19:59,984 --> 00:20:04,489
Maybe so. You can talk
about freedom all you want,

153
00:20:04,655 --> 00:20:09,744
but still don't know
what it's like to have to fight for it.

154
00:20:30,472 --> 00:20:32,516
Perhaps my lecture was unwarranted.

155
00:20:32,683 --> 00:20:35,143
I am grateful for what you did back there.

156
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:37,979
You'd really like America.
We've got the Liberty Bell,

157
00:20:38,147 --> 00:20:41,024
Disneyland on both coasts.
It's happening.

158
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:45,070
I'm sorry. I really don't know any German.

159
00:20:45,237 --> 00:20:48,781
That's all right. I know a little German.
He's sitting over there.

160
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:56,331
What do you recommend?

161
00:20:56,498 --> 00:20:58,416
I recommend the pork bellies

162
00:20:58,582 --> 00:21:01,252
marinated in diced pig entrails

163
00:21:01,377 --> 00:21:04,089
or the roast swine knuckles

164
00:21:04,255 --> 00:21:08,635
poached with flaming hog balls.

165
00:21:10,345 --> 00:21:12,388
Anything's fine.

166
00:21:16,726 --> 00:21:19,437
- Thank you...
- Hillary.

167
00:21:19,603 --> 00:21:22,314
That's an unusual name.

168
00:21:22,482 --> 00:21:27,946
It's German. It means,
she whose bosoms defy gravity.

169
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:33,868
Pleased to meet you.
My name's Nick.

170
00:21:34,034 --> 00:21:36,829
Nick, what does that mean?

171
00:21:36,995 --> 00:21:40,165
Nothing. My dad thought of it
while he was shaving.

172
00:21:45,295 --> 00:21:48,883
Are you in some kind of trouble
with the police?

173
00:21:49,049 --> 00:21:51,719
Some things are better left unsaid.

174
00:21:52,677 --> 00:21:54,262
Like what?

175
00:21:54,429 --> 00:22:01,061
Sometimes when you blow your nose
into a tissue and put it in your purse.

176
00:22:01,227 --> 00:22:07,483
Then you reach for your lipstick, your hand
gushes into it, and it goes all over...

177
00:22:07,651 --> 00:22:10,236
You're right.
Some things are better left unsaid.

178
00:22:14,241 --> 00:22:16,242
Thank you very much.

179
00:22:17,368 --> 00:22:19,496
Ladies and gentlemen.

180
00:22:19,662 --> 00:22:25,125
We are fortunate to have with us tonight,
a singer, whose great talent

181
00:22:25,293 --> 00:22:29,547
is exceeded only by his devotion
to his country.

182
00:22:29,714 --> 00:22:32,550
He truly has the gift of song.

183
00:22:32,717 --> 00:22:34,760
A golden voice. Inspired talent and...

184
00:22:34,926 --> 00:22:37,805
Is there something wrong?

185
00:22:37,971 --> 00:22:40,224
I was afraid this might happen.

186
00:22:40,391 --> 00:22:45,270
General Streck of the High Command
is a most fervent admirer,

187
00:22:45,437 --> 00:22:48,774
and owns a complete set of his works.

188
00:22:48,941 --> 00:22:52,277
He is a very shy and gentle man,

189
00:22:52,444 --> 00:22:56,490
but perhaps we could persuade him
to sing for us.

190
00:22:56,657 --> 00:22:58,826
Shall we ask him?

191
00:23:03,246 --> 00:23:07,376
I better do what they want.
I promised my manager.

192
00:23:21,514 --> 00:23:23,433
Thank you, sir.

193
00:23:25,352 --> 00:23:28,020
Watch the change
in the second chorus.

194
00:23:28,188 --> 00:23:29,564
Oh, my God.

195
00:25:45,738 --> 00:25:48,116
Your hog balls, sir.

196
00:26:04,965 --> 00:26:06,425
Cedric!

197
00:26:19,104 --> 00:26:22,525
- What have they done to you?
- It was a trap!

198
00:26:22,691 --> 00:26:26,320
They must have known
I was staying at the Howard Johnson's.

199
00:26:26,486 --> 00:26:29,531
- But who did this?
- Never mind about that.

200
00:26:29,699 --> 00:26:32,242
We've got to rescue your father
before it's too late.

201
00:26:32,408 --> 00:26:34,620
But what are we going to do?

202
00:26:34,786 --> 00:26:35,955
I was...

203
00:26:37,998 --> 00:26:40,751
...supposed to go to the ballet tonight,

204
00:26:40,917 --> 00:26:43,587
to meet a man called "The Torch".

205
00:26:43,753 --> 00:26:45,381
Thank you.

206
00:26:45,547 --> 00:26:49,176
He's the leader of the Resistance.
He'll help us find your father.

207
00:26:49,342 --> 00:26:53,095
- I'll go.
- No, you can't go. It's too dangerous.

208
00:26:53,263 --> 00:26:56,057
I must! He'll be tortured.

209
00:26:56,224 --> 00:26:59,227
All right, but be very careful at the ballet.

210
00:26:59,394 --> 00:27:01,604
Where is the ticket?

211
00:27:01,772 --> 00:27:04,106
In the glove compartment.

212
00:27:04,274 --> 00:27:05,984
Can you reach it from the inside?

213
00:27:09,529 --> 00:27:11,864
How about the other hand?

214
00:27:16,202 --> 00:27:18,454
No, that's not it. Let me try.

215
00:27:23,334 --> 00:27:25,127
Here it is.

216
00:29:21,616 --> 00:29:24,118
Come on, we've got to get out of here.

217
00:29:24,286 --> 00:29:28,623
- Shouldn't we wait for the police?
- That was the police!

218
00:29:34,796 --> 00:29:36,673
In here.

219
00:29:45,432 --> 00:29:47,558
We can get out this way.

220
00:29:47,725 --> 00:29:51,561
- Wait. First you can explain.
- I'm not sure I can.

221
00:29:57,735 --> 00:30:00,029
I only know I have put you in great danger.

222
00:30:00,195 --> 00:30:02,197
Trust me. You must come with me.

223
00:30:02,364 --> 00:30:05,867
I don't know what trouble you're in,
but don't worry about me.

224
00:30:06,035 --> 00:30:08,871
I'm a guest of the government.
I can explain everything.

225
00:30:09,037 --> 00:30:11,623
But you're mistaken. They'll put you in...

226
00:30:13,542 --> 00:30:16,837
Go while you still can.
They can't do anything to me.

227
00:30:41,569 --> 00:30:47,868
Martin, boy am I glad to see you.
I've been here 20 minutes already.

228
00:30:50,452 --> 00:30:53,790
Nick, I've tried everything.

229
00:30:53,956 --> 00:30:57,210
The Embassy, the German Government,
the consulate.

230
00:30:57,376 --> 00:31:01,505
I even talked to the UN Ambassador.
It's no use.

231
00:31:01,672 --> 00:31:04,758
I just can't bring my wife to orgasm.

232
00:31:06,718 --> 00:31:09,430
That's a shame, Martin.

233
00:31:09,597 --> 00:31:11,848
Have you tried one of these?

234
00:31:16,103 --> 00:31:18,981
Thanks. I'll give it a whirl.

235
00:31:20,524 --> 00:31:25,988
I'm getting worried about this place.
I don't think they've even heard of a trial.

236
00:31:26,154 --> 00:31:29,449
All I know is, after you left the cafe
last night, I met a girl.

237
00:31:29,617 --> 00:31:31,993
Later at the ballet she was alone.

238
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:34,871
Then I see this guy with a gun at her head.

239
00:31:35,038 --> 00:31:39,209
He's looking like he's gonna kill her
and might have if I hadn't stepped in.

240
00:31:39,375 --> 00:31:43,714
There's got to be someone you can call,
to straighten this mess out.

241
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:48,009
I figure they've got to let you out
for your concert, Friday night.

242
00:31:48,176 --> 00:31:50,845
They're beaming it live by satellite
to 85 countries.

243
00:31:51,012 --> 00:31:55,558
Just relax and remember,
there's nothing to worry about.

244
00:32:40,977 --> 00:32:43,062
Amen.

245
00:32:51,655 --> 00:32:54,116
We wish to impress upon you, Mr Rivers,

246
00:32:54,282 --> 00:32:57,911
that we have methods of dealing
with those who will not cooperate.

247
00:32:58,077 --> 00:33:02,332
For the last time,
why did you attack Sergeant Kruger?

248
00:33:02,498 --> 00:33:05,961
I didn't know who it was.
I just saw him pull a gun on a girl.

249
00:33:06,127 --> 00:33:11,715
Might I remind you, Mr Rivers, the penalty
for murder is death by firing squad.

250
00:33:11,883 --> 00:33:15,970
Let us hope for your sake
that Sergeant Kruger survives.

251
00:33:20,265 --> 00:33:22,935
It is the hospital, mein General.

252
00:33:23,101 --> 00:33:26,980
What is the condition of Sergeant Kruger?

253
00:33:27,148 --> 00:33:33,195
I see. Let me know if there
is any change in his condition.

254
00:33:33,821 --> 00:33:35,656
He is dead.

255
00:33:40,452 --> 00:33:44,706
You leave me no alternative,
but to introduce two of my associates.

256
00:33:45,916 --> 00:33:49,878
Bruno is almost blind.
He has to operate wholly by touch.

257
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:55,508
Klaus is a moron, who knows only what
he reads in "The New York Post".

258
00:33:55,676 --> 00:33:58,762
I believe they never let a man
lose consciousness

259
00:33:58,928 --> 00:34:01,0140
however long they may work on him.

260
00:34:01,181 --> 00:34:03,016
You don't scare me.

261
00:34:03,183 --> 00:34:06,144
My manager is on his way
to the American Consulate.

262
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:09,314
Do not be so sure, Mr Rivers.

263
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,524
Evidently, your friend did not realise

264
00:34:11,692 --> 00:34:15,319
that here in East Germany
we use 220 volt current.

265
00:34:15,486 --> 00:34:19,865
He was found in his hotel room impaled
on a large electrical device.

266
00:34:20,033 --> 00:34:22,076
Our surgeons did what they could

267
00:34:22,243 --> 00:34:27,040
but it took them two hours
just to get the smile off his face.

268
00:34:29,709 --> 00:34:32,795
Perhaps the American
has chosen to reconsider.

269
00:34:43,722 --> 00:34:47,435
Make sure they leave no marks.

270
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:14,503
Do you know which room
the final chemistry exam is in?

271
00:35:14,669 --> 00:35:17,881
All the exams are over.
Haven't you been to class?

272
00:35:18,048 --> 00:35:20,591
- No.
- But it's the end of the semester.

273
00:35:20,759 --> 00:35:26,722
No, I haven't studied.
Oh no, I'm back in school.

274
00:35:26,890 --> 00:35:29,935
I can't believe I'm back in school.

275
00:35:33,355 --> 00:35:34,940
Thank God.

276
00:35:39,986 --> 00:35:41,446
Well?

277
00:35:41,612 --> 00:35:44,782
They're still working on him.
He won't break.

278
00:35:44,949 --> 00:35:47,201
They've tried everything.

279
00:35:47,368 --> 00:35:50,079
Do you want me to bring out
the LeRoy Neiman paintings?

280
00:35:50,246 --> 00:35:54,374
No. We cannot risk violating
the Geneva Convention.

281
00:35:54,542 --> 00:35:56,669
We'll break him tomorrow.

282
00:37:15,871 --> 00:37:18,582
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

283
00:37:18,749 --> 00:37:22,336
My name is Nick Rivers.
Who are you?

284
00:37:22,502 --> 00:37:28,342
I am Dr Paul Flammond.
I am a prisoner here, just like you.

285
00:37:28,508 --> 00:37:31,969
A year ago, I was close to perfecting

286
00:37:32,137 --> 00:37:35,473
the first magnetic desalinisation process.

287
00:37:35,641 --> 00:37:39,561
So revolutionary,
it was capable of removing the salt

288
00:37:39,728 --> 00:37:43,189
from over 500 million gallons
of sea water a day.

289
00:37:43,357 --> 00:37:47,485
Do you realise what that could mean
to the starving nations of the earth?

290
00:37:49,654 --> 00:37:52,323
They'd have enough salt to last forever.

291
00:37:53,491 --> 00:37:56,244
But then one night,
the Secret Police broke into my house.

292
00:37:56,410 --> 00:37:59,623
They tore me from my family,
ransacked my laboratory

293
00:37:59,789 --> 00:38:02,459
and brought me to this dungeon.

294
00:38:02,584 --> 00:38:04,169
That sucks!

295
00:38:04,335 --> 00:38:07,046
For the first time in my life,

296
00:38:07,212 --> 00:38:11,550
- I am ashamed of being a scientist.
- What do you mean?

297
00:38:11,717 --> 00:38:15,596
They are forcing me to create
a horrible weapon.

298
00:38:15,763 --> 00:38:19,141
- Can't you refuse?
- I wish I could.

299
00:38:19,308 --> 00:38:22,145
But they are holding my daughter.

300
00:38:22,311 --> 00:38:26,607
They'll kill her unless I complete
the Polaris Mine by Sunday.

301
00:38:26,773 --> 00:38:30,111
Sunday? That's Simchas Torah.

302
00:38:30,277 --> 00:38:33,197
And the day the entire NATO
submarine fleet

303
00:38:33,363 --> 00:38:35,740
passes through the Straits of Gibraltar.

304
00:38:35,908 --> 00:38:38,034
Is this the Polaris mine?

305
00:38:38,202 --> 00:38:43,039
Yes. By Sunday I will be able to arm it
with a nuclear warhead.

306
00:38:43,207 --> 00:38:46,543
- How does it work?
- It is a magnetic mine

307
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:51,173
so powerful it will attract itself
to submarines miles away.

308
00:38:51,339 --> 00:38:54,968
- How about that?
- Oh, no.

309
00:39:02,141 --> 00:39:06,062
Go quickly. If they find out
you've seen this, your life will be worth less

310
00:39:06,229 --> 00:39:09,440
than a truck load of dead rats
in a tampon factory.

311
00:39:18,908 --> 00:39:20,409
Right away.

312
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:23,371
- Von Horst!
- Ja, mein General.

313
00:39:23,537 --> 00:39:26,416
The government wishes to avoid
an international incident.

314
00:39:26,582 --> 00:39:29,252
Mr Rivers must perform
his concert tonight.

315
00:39:29,418 --> 00:39:32,088
He is to be executed this very minute.

316
00:39:32,254 --> 00:39:36,425
- It'll have to wait. Call them at once.
- Ja, mein General.

317
00:44:13,613 --> 00:44:15,448
Those bikes!

318
00:44:28,836 --> 00:44:31,713
That is no excuse!
Search the road again!

319
00:44:42,432 --> 00:44:44,559
They're in the Eastern sector.

320
00:44:44,726 --> 00:44:47,021
I want the whole area sealed off!

321
00:45:04,579 --> 00:45:06,998
There's a used book store
somewhere around here.

322
00:45:07,165 --> 00:45:08,791
The owner is a member of the Resistance.

323
00:45:08,958 --> 00:45:13,504
- If we can find him...
- Resistance? Wait a minute.

324
00:45:13,671 --> 00:45:18,134
Don't you think it's about time
you told what this is all about?

325
00:45:18,301 --> 00:45:21,387
I'm sorry, I guess I do owe
you an explanation.

326
00:45:21,554 --> 00:45:26,558
Only a year ago I was teaching
a course in black history

327
00:45:26,726 --> 00:45:29,520
at the University of Blaupunkt.

328
00:45:29,687 --> 00:45:35,067
One night, I came home to find my father
had been arrested by the Secret Police.

329
00:45:35,233 --> 00:45:38,487
I've been trying to find him ever since.

330
00:45:39,238 --> 00:45:42,241
Wait a minute. That's Dr Flammond.

331
00:45:42,408 --> 00:45:45,077
I saw him yesterday in Flurgendorf Prison.

332
00:45:45,243 --> 00:45:47,495
Flurgendorf Prison? Is he all right?

333
00:45:47,663 --> 00:45:50,123
- He looks fine.
- Thank God, he's safe.

334
00:45:50,290 --> 00:45:53,377
We must get this information
to the Resistance.

335
00:45:53,543 --> 00:45:57,005
- Maybe they can help us.
- Let's go.

336
00:46:36,752 --> 00:46:41,590
There it is.
It's a Swedish book store.

337
00:47:01,401 --> 00:47:02,986
May I help you?

338
00:47:04,071 --> 00:47:06,281
My father is Dr. Paul Flammond

339
00:47:06,447 --> 00:47:10,327
I'm sorry. I don't know a Dr. Flammond.

340
00:47:11,077 --> 00:47:15,373
He told me you may have a book of
Swedish poems by Von Brieson.

341
00:47:17,626 --> 00:47:20,211
So you are Hillary Flammond!

342
00:47:23,923 --> 00:47:27,802
What can I do for you?

343
00:47:28,844 --> 00:47:30,847
We must speak with "The Torch".

344
00:47:31,013 --> 00:47:33,141
That will be very difficult.

345
00:47:41,315 --> 00:47:44,027
But I will try to arrange it.

346
00:47:45,028 --> 00:47:47,321
Can we leave tonight?

347
00:47:51,366 --> 00:47:54,120
It is too dangerous to travel at night.

348
00:47:57,081 --> 00:47:59,917
You will be taken in the morning
to a potato farm.

349
00:48:00,084 --> 00:48:02,461
Where can we stay tonight?

350
00:48:02,627 --> 00:48:04,296
There is a loft upstairs.

351
00:48:04,462 --> 00:48:06,965
You can use that fire pole.

352
00:48:20,103 --> 00:48:26,693
That's OK. Don't feel bad.
It happens to lots of men the first time.

353
00:48:26,859 --> 00:48:28,903
Just relax. I'll pour you a drink.

354
00:48:29,070 --> 00:48:32,073
We can always try again
in a couple of hours,

355
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:36,578
she said, as she laid down beside him
and caressed his chest.

356
00:48:36,744 --> 00:48:39,289
Can you believe they print this trash?

357
00:48:39,455 --> 00:48:43,084
Don't worry about it. You were going
to tell me something about your childhood.

358
00:48:45,586 --> 00:48:47,964
When I was a young girl,

359
00:48:48,130 --> 00:48:50,591
my uncle took me on a tropical cruise.

360
00:48:50,759 --> 00:48:52,760
But there was a terrible storm

361
00:48:52,927 --> 00:48:55,221
and the boat sank.

362
00:48:55,387 --> 00:48:57,849
I managed to swim to a deserted island

363
00:48:58,015 --> 00:49:00,310
with a young boy, named Nigel.

364
00:49:00,476 --> 00:49:03,020
Together we had to learn to survive.

365
00:49:06,023 --> 00:49:08,526
Fortunately the ocean provided its bounty,

366
00:49:08,692 --> 00:49:11,528
which Nigel would catch every day.

367
00:49:11,696 --> 00:49:14,739
Later, I would forage inland
for fruit and vegetables

368
00:49:14,907 --> 00:49:19,537
from the endless varieties
of trees and bushes all over the island.

369
00:49:19,703 --> 00:49:23,457
We busied ourselves chopping palm
fronds and lacing them to bamboo

370
00:49:23,623 --> 00:49:26,043
with dried seaweed and snot.

371
00:49:26,209 --> 00:49:29,379
This not only provided us
with a safe haven from the rain.

372
00:49:29,547 --> 00:49:32,382
but sheltered us
from the relentless Santa Ana winds

373
00:49:32,549 --> 00:49:35,301
which would periodically
ravage the island.

374
00:49:35,469 --> 00:49:38,179
The years passed and as we grew up,

375
00:49:38,346 --> 00:49:42,851
we began to notice
strange new feelings awakening in us.

376
00:49:43,018 --> 00:49:45,479
There was no one around to explain this.

377
00:49:45,645 --> 00:49:48,397
We had to learn by ourselves.

378
00:50:17,968 --> 00:50:20,638
Then one day he went fishing.

379
00:50:20,804 --> 00:50:24,267
That was the last I ever saw of Nigel.

380
00:50:24,433 --> 00:50:27,394
I spent months by myself on that island,

381
00:50:27,561 --> 00:50:31,023
until I was finally rescued
by a passing ship.

382
00:50:31,190 --> 00:50:33,775
I'll never forget my feeling of relief.

383
00:50:33,943 --> 00:50:35,986
You can't imagine what it's like

384
00:50:36,153 --> 00:50:38,196
to be separated from your family

385
00:50:38,364 --> 00:50:40,407
at such a young age.

386
00:50:40,574 --> 00:50:42,325
I think I can.

387
00:50:45,996 --> 00:50:50,625
When I was about six years old,
my momma took me to the city.

388
00:50:50,792 --> 00:50:55,338
We went to one of those big old
department stores, and I got lost.

389
00:50:55,505 --> 00:50:57,966
They tried to page her,

390
00:50:58,132 --> 00:51:01,177
but the PA system was on the fritz.

391
00:51:02,303 --> 00:51:05,264
I never saw my momma again.

392
00:51:05,432 --> 00:51:08,142
Some people
from the cosmetics department

393
00:51:08,309 --> 00:51:10,562
fed me a bowl of soup and some bread.

394
00:51:10,728 --> 00:51:12,772
Days stretched into weeks.

395
00:51:12,939 --> 00:51:15,065
One February they got jammed up

396
00:51:15,233 --> 00:51:17,902
during the semi-annual
Lincoln's birthday sale.

397
00:51:18,027 --> 00:51:20,529
They asked me to help out
in Pre-Teen Maternity.

398
00:51:22,949 --> 00:51:25,409
Then one day I overheard
a conversation in personnel

399
00:51:25,576 --> 00:51:28,620
about them needing a new jingle
for their radio ad.

400
00:51:28,788 --> 00:51:32,374
So I picked up my guitar
and I wrote down a tune

401
00:51:32,541 --> 00:51:36,670
that had been mulling and creeping
and crawling around in my head.

402
00:51:36,837 --> 00:51:39,340
It went something like this.

403
00:52:53,496 --> 00:52:55,163
Oh, Nick.

404
00:53:40,041 --> 00:53:42,293
All right, this is it.

405
00:53:42,459 --> 00:53:44,628
I must leave you here.

406
00:53:45,963 --> 00:53:48,257
Go now, quickly.

407
00:53:51,093 --> 00:53:54,304
- Is he all right?
- He caught a cold the other day.

408
00:53:54,472 --> 00:53:56,557
He's just a little hoarse.

409
00:53:56,724 --> 00:53:58,768
Giddy-up, Mario.

410
00:54:10,988 --> 00:54:13,699
- Yes?
- Is this the potato farm?

411
00:54:13,865 --> 00:54:18,161
Yes, I am Albert Potato. Who are you?

412
00:54:18,329 --> 00:54:21,415
We were sent by Sven Jorgensen.

413
00:54:25,543 --> 00:54:27,253
Come this way.

414
00:54:53,697 --> 00:54:57,866
- What do you want?
- We wanna see "The Torch".

415
00:54:58,034 --> 00:55:00,911
No one is allowed to see "The Torch".

416
00:55:01,078 --> 00:55:06,709
But we have important information about
my father, Dr Paul Flammond.

417
00:55:06,875 --> 00:55:09,545
We shall see.

418
00:55:22,641 --> 00:55:25,477
- Nigel!
- Hillary!

419
00:55:32,276 --> 00:55:36,029
It is you. My darling, Hillary.

420
00:55:36,196 --> 00:55:38,991
If only you knew how I've yearned
for this day to come.

421
00:55:39,157 --> 00:55:43,870
Sleepless nights, lonely hours,
hoping, praying that once more

422
00:55:44,037 --> 00:55:47,290
I would gaze
into your ravishing brown eyes.

423
00:55:47,457 --> 00:55:51,169
Who is this I should thank
for bringing you back to me?

424
00:55:51,335 --> 00:55:54,296
This is Nick.
Nick Rivers, he's a friend.

425
00:55:54,464 --> 00:55:58,593
Forgive us, Mr Rivers,
if we have been less than hospitable.

426
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:04,515
Recently we've had reason to believe
there is a traitor in the Resistance.

427
00:56:04,682 --> 00:56:08,394
Du Quois,
introduce the American to the men.

428
00:56:08,561 --> 00:56:10,271
Very well.

429
00:56:11,105 --> 00:56:17,320
This is Chevalier, Montage, Detente,

430
00:56:17,486 --> 00:56:21,950
Avant Garde, and Deja Vu.

431
00:56:22,908 --> 00:56:25,494
Have we not met before, Monsieur?

432
00:56:26,453 --> 00:56:28,288
I don't think so.

433
00:56:33,043 --> 00:56:34,544
Over there...

434
00:56:34,712 --> 00:56:39,633
Croissant, Souffle, Escargot,

435
00:56:39,799 --> 00:56:42,219
and Chocolate Mousse.

436
00:56:48,266 --> 00:56:51,686
Now, Mr Rivers,
what is the news that you bring us?

437
00:56:51,853 --> 00:56:54,981
I've seen Dr Flammond
in Flurgendorf prison.

438
00:56:55,148 --> 00:56:58,819
He told me the Polaris mine
will be ready on Sunday.

439
00:57:00,027 --> 00:57:01,196
Sacrebleu.

440
00:57:02,614 --> 00:57:04,782
We'll have to move out tonight.

441
00:57:04,950 --> 00:57:06,993
I'll be back in a moment, my darling.

442
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:09,370
Prepare the gear for the jump.

443
00:57:09,537 --> 00:57:11,288
Cordon bleu. Zut!

444
00:57:11,456 --> 00:57:14,375
- I want to explain.
- What's to explain?

445
00:57:14,542 --> 00:57:17,921
I'm not the first guy who fell in love
with a girl he met in a restaurant,

446
00:57:18,087 --> 00:57:21,173
who turned out to be the daughter
of a kidnapped scientist,

447
00:57:21,341 --> 00:57:24,677
to lose her to her childhood lover
she'd last seen on a deserted island

448
00:57:24,843 --> 00:57:28,264
who, 1 5 years later, is the leader
of the French underground.

449
00:57:28,430 --> 00:57:31,684
It all sounds like some bad movie.

450
00:57:38,606 --> 00:57:43,945
Forget it. It'll be better for everyone
if we just forget what's happened.

451
00:57:44,071 --> 00:57:48,284
We've arranged for your safe
transportation across the border tonight.

452
00:57:48,450 --> 00:57:51,704
It's the least we can do
to show our gratitude.

453
00:57:51,870 --> 00:57:57,334
Come, my darling, let me show you
what I've done to the fallout shelter.

454
00:58:19,856 --> 00:58:22,192
Do not take it so hard, Nick.

455
00:58:22,358 --> 00:58:25,653
Life is filled with its little miseries.

456
00:58:25,820 --> 00:58:29,824
Each of us, in his own way,
must learn to deal with adversity

457
00:58:29,990 --> 00:58:32,826
in a mature and adult fashion.

458
00:58:43,962 --> 00:58:47,257
- Mind if I have a swig of this?
- Go right ahead.

459
00:58:47,425 --> 00:58:50,927
- What the hell is this stuff?
- Gasoline.

460
00:58:55,557 --> 00:58:59,561
Don't worry, my darling.
I'm sure your friend will get over it.

461
00:58:59,728 --> 00:59:02,188
He seems a good chap, really.

462
00:59:02,356 --> 00:59:04,816
How wonderful you've returned to me,

463
00:59:04,983 --> 00:59:08,487
when I desperately need you
by my side, to fight for the cause...

464
00:59:08,653 --> 00:59:12,323
- Our cause.
- Oh, Nigel, I am proud of you.

465
00:59:12,491 --> 00:59:17,037
But I'm so confused.
All these years I thought you were dead.

466
00:59:17,203 --> 00:59:19,623
And by all rights I should be.

467
00:59:19,789 --> 00:59:22,333
I floated at sea for days,
nearly unconscious.

468
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:25,670
Then as luck would have it,
I was picked up by a passing freighter.

469
00:59:25,837 --> 00:59:28,589
I tried to get them to save you too.

470
00:59:28,756 --> 00:59:31,509
It was a foreign ship
and they didn't understand English.

471
00:59:31,718 --> 00:59:36,806
I yelled and screamed, but it only
seemed to excite them all the more.

472
00:59:36,973 --> 00:59:40,101
They took advantage of me
in ways I cannot describe.

473
00:59:40,267 --> 00:59:46,024
Oh, Nigel, it must have been awful.

474
00:59:51,946 --> 00:59:53,822
Latrine!

475
00:59:57,410 --> 01:00:00,788
- What did you find out, Latrine?
- Where are the others?

476
01:00:00,954 --> 01:00:02,789
We never had a chance.

477
01:00:02,957 --> 01:00:04,792
It was a slaughter.

478
01:00:04,958 --> 01:00:08,003
We must put a stop
to these afternoon football games.

479
01:00:08,169 --> 01:00:11,464
- Which direction did they come from?
- Up the road.

480
01:00:13,133 --> 01:00:16,637
- Take cover!
- They're gonna kill us all.

481
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:31,901
Take this.

482
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:39,008
Grenade.

483
01:01:51,021 --> 01:01:54,524
We're running out of time.
The plane will not wait for us.

484
01:01:54,691 --> 01:01:56,734
We'll have to make a break for it.

485
01:01:56,901 --> 01:01:59,403
Rendezvous at the cafe
near the landing field.

486
01:01:59,570 --> 01:02:00,654
Wait!

487
01:02:17,755 --> 01:02:19,674
Nice shooting.

488
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:20,925
My man!

489
01:02:46,199 --> 01:02:49,119
Good. Now everybody's accounted for.

490
01:02:49,286 --> 01:02:52,497
Here's the plan.
We'll be taking off at 1 :00 am.

491
01:02:52,664 --> 01:02:54,540
What about the American?

492
01:02:54,708 --> 01:02:57,460
A truck will be here
at exactly midnight.

493
01:02:57,627 --> 01:03:00,505
He'll jump on the back
and be driven on to the border.

494
01:03:00,672 --> 01:03:04,550
Wait. Nick is the only one
who knows the inside of that prison.

495
01:03:08,054 --> 01:03:12,350
Well, Monsieur Rivers,
it seems that you have become,

496
01:03:12,516 --> 01:03:15,270
how do you say, indispensable?

497
01:03:15,436 --> 01:03:17,230
Indispensable.

498
01:03:18,690 --> 01:03:20,734
That's what I thought.

499
01:03:20,900 --> 01:03:24,820
Sorry, fellas. I've done my time
in Flurgendorf prison.

500
01:03:24,987 --> 01:03:27,406
I got a truck to meet.

501
01:03:30,367 --> 01:03:34,246
Nick, ask any price you want,
but you must help us.

502
01:03:34,413 --> 01:03:38,542
Seems as long as I know my way
around that prison, I'll never be lonely.

503
01:03:38,709 --> 01:03:40,753
I know how you feel about me.

504
01:03:40,919 --> 01:03:44,006
But put your feelings aside
for something more important.

505
01:03:44,173 --> 01:03:47,634
Like what a great cause
you and Nigel are fighting for?

506
01:03:47,802 --> 01:03:50,888
- But this was your cause too.
- My only cause is my music.

507
01:03:51,054 --> 01:03:53,139
That's exactly what I mean.

508
01:03:53,307 --> 01:03:58,353
Didn't you see the eyes of those kids
at your concert? You must help us.

509
01:03:58,520 --> 01:04:00,855
If not for me, for the cause of freedom.

510
01:04:03,275 --> 01:04:04,943
Latrine.

511
01:04:06,194 --> 01:04:10,115
- A traitor in our midst.
- Well done, Latrine.

512
01:04:10,281 --> 01:04:13,242
I see you have dealt with him
appropriately.

513
01:04:13,410 --> 01:04:15,245
Not the bird, you fool!

514
01:04:15,411 --> 01:04:19,373
This is a carrier pigeon on its way
to German headquarters.

515
01:04:19,541 --> 01:04:22,043
Look, a message.

516
01:04:22,210 --> 01:04:27,841
Resistance planning to free Flammond,
Sunday, 8:00 am.

517
01:04:28,007 --> 01:04:32,594
That means the traitor
is someone at this very table.

518
01:04:38,809 --> 01:04:43,689
Excuse me, aren't you Nick Rivers,
the American rock and roll star?

519
01:04:45,483 --> 01:04:47,318
No, I'm not.

520
01:04:47,484 --> 01:04:50,613
But you must be.
Won't you sing us one song?

521
01:04:50,779 --> 01:04:53,615
I'm sorry. You must have me confused
with somebody else.

522
01:04:53,783 --> 01:04:57,203
I'm Mel Torme.

523
01:05:02,207 --> 01:05:03,875
That was close.

524
01:05:04,042 --> 01:05:07,880
- Perhaps a bit too close.
- What do you mean?

525
01:05:08,046 --> 01:05:11,967
We have no proof
that this man is who he claims to be.

526
01:05:12,133 --> 01:05:16,262
Yet we're asking him to lead us into
Germany's most heavily guarded prison.

527
01:05:16,430 --> 01:05:19,975
- That's absurd!
- Just a moment, my darling.

528
01:05:20,141 --> 01:05:22,310
He came to us with no credentials.

529
01:05:22,477 --> 01:05:26,606
The Germans never knew the location
of our headquarters, until he arrived.

530
01:05:26,773 --> 01:05:29,276
And we've been
infiltrated by a traitor.

531
01:05:29,442 --> 01:05:32,153
Nigel, what are you saying?

532
01:05:33,279 --> 01:05:36,865
How do we know
he's not Mel Torme?

533
01:05:50,045 --> 01:05:52,340
Look, he's at the jukebox.

534
01:07:56,168 --> 01:07:58,171
This is not Mel Torme.

535
01:08:27,283 --> 01:08:29,034
Oh, Nick.

536
01:08:31,495 --> 01:08:32,955
Yes?

537
01:08:33,121 --> 01:08:36,750
We don't know
what's going to happen down there.

538
01:08:36,917 --> 01:08:41,462
This may be the last time I'll see you.
There's something I wanted to say.

539
01:08:41,630 --> 01:08:44,341
- You don't have to say anything.
- But I want to.

540
01:08:44,507 --> 01:08:46,594
You must know that when we were
together last night,

541
01:08:46,760 --> 01:08:49,430
I had no idea that Nigel
was still alive.

542
01:08:49,555 --> 01:08:51,932
And now that you know?

543
01:08:53,516 --> 01:08:56,853
Oh, Nick, his work is so important to him.

544
01:08:57,020 --> 01:09:02,274
I must stay with him.
He pleaded with me not to leave.

545
01:09:02,442 --> 01:09:06,779
I just hope you realise
that's all he means to me.

546
01:09:06,947 --> 01:09:10,533
Oh, I don't know what's right any longer.

547
01:09:14,370 --> 01:09:17,915
I only wish I didn't love you so much.

548
01:10:04,419 --> 01:10:06,588
I've spotted the herd.

549
01:10:06,754 --> 01:10:09,257
They're the key to the whole plan.

550
01:10:09,424 --> 01:10:12,218
Now, we're here.

551
01:10:14,386 --> 01:10:16,139
Every morning at 7:1 5

552
01:10:16,305 --> 01:10:19,643
the prison guards bring the cows
from here, up this road

553
01:10:19,809 --> 01:10:22,520
towards the prison
for their morning milking.

554
01:10:22,686 --> 01:10:26,482
Du Quois and I will merge
with the herd here.

555
01:10:26,649 --> 01:10:31,612
And sneak in through the gate
in the electrified fence.

556
01:10:31,779 --> 01:10:34,240
Then we'll break away from the other cows

557
01:10:34,406 --> 01:10:36,617
and enter the generator building here.

558
01:10:36,783 --> 01:10:41,413
At exactly 7:25 we cut the power.

559
01:10:41,581 --> 01:10:45,710
The rest of you come through here,
scale this wall,

560
01:10:45,876 --> 01:10:48,337
and Nick can lead you to Flammond's cell.

561
01:10:48,503 --> 01:10:51,882
Meanwhile, Hillary will steal this truck
by the railway crossing

562
01:10:52,049 --> 01:10:55,136
and pick us up back here.
Then we drive to the landing field

563
01:10:55,302 --> 01:10:58,013
where the plane will be waiting for us.
Let's go.

564
01:11:11,484 --> 01:11:14,363
No, you take the head.
I'm taking the back.

565
01:11:14,529 --> 01:11:16,573
- But the plan was...
- Forget it.

566
01:11:16,740 --> 01:11:20,369
I give the orders.
Shut up and give me the back half.

567
01:11:20,535 --> 01:11:23,746
All right, be an asshole.

568
01:11:33,631 --> 01:11:36,551
- Here they come.
- OK, let's move out.

569
01:11:42,973 --> 01:11:45,643
All right, let's go. Double time.

570
01:11:54,818 --> 01:11:58,948
We only have five minutes to get
to the circuit box and throw the switch.

571
01:11:59,114 --> 01:12:02,034
We've got to hurry.
Can you see the gate?

572
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:05,704
- Yes, it's just ahead.
- Where are the guards?

573
01:12:05,871 --> 01:12:08,665
I can only see one.

574
01:12:08,833 --> 01:12:11,293
There girl, move along.

575
01:12:19,009 --> 01:12:21,511
Stay behind the guards.

576
01:12:21,679 --> 01:12:25,265
Once we're round the corner
we'll break away from the herd.

577
01:12:25,432 --> 01:12:27,433
OK, now!

578
01:12:29,393 --> 01:12:31,021
I think we did it.

579
01:12:34,941 --> 01:12:39,237
- Can you see the generator?
- It's behind the feed bin.

580
01:12:39,404 --> 01:12:42,114
All right, let's go. We've got to hurry.

581
01:12:43,199 --> 01:12:44,993
Mon Dieu!

582
01:12:50,582 --> 01:12:53,500
Nigel, you OK?

583
01:12:53,668 --> 01:12:55,419
Oh, yeah.

584
01:12:55,587 --> 01:12:57,421
Let's go.

585
01:12:57,588 --> 01:13:02,301
What's the hurry? Why are you always
in such a bloody rush?

586
01:13:02,468 --> 01:13:05,680
I just wanted to take a...rest.

587
01:13:24,240 --> 01:13:27,743
- The guards have passed.
- How long till they cut the power?

588
01:13:27,910 --> 01:13:30,578
Three more minutes.

589
01:13:30,746 --> 01:13:32,956
Then we can cut the wire.

590
01:13:57,605 --> 01:13:59,733
There it is.

591
01:14:48,821 --> 01:14:50,115
Lovely.

592
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:07,966
You're all right now. I'm here.

593
01:15:08,883 --> 01:15:10,802
It's all right.

594
01:15:17,224 --> 01:15:18,684
Hey.

595
01:15:38,036 --> 01:15:39,079
Here, here.

596
01:15:46,545 --> 01:15:48,546
Vive la France!

597
01:16:03,145 --> 01:16:05,647
- Nigel, what are you doing?
- Never you mind.

598
01:16:05,813 --> 01:16:08,275
Why do you want to go back
to the meter shed?

599
01:16:08,441 --> 01:16:12,571
- We're turning the power back on.
- But that will set off the alarms.

600
01:16:12,737 --> 01:16:15,448
- The others will be trapped. I refuse!
- Oh?

601
01:16:17,074 --> 01:16:20,453
This gun says you won't.
Now, move.

602
01:16:20,619 --> 01:16:25,542
So, it is you who is the traitor!

603
01:16:40,765 --> 01:16:45,185
Don't take it too badly.
You're no more a fool than the others.

604
01:16:45,352 --> 01:16:48,272
Now, get over there and...

605
01:16:53,736 --> 01:16:56,988
- Dr Flammond.
- Nick!

606
01:16:57,156 --> 01:16:59,700
- We're taking you out of here.
- But my daughter.

607
01:16:59,867 --> 01:17:02,327
Don't worry. Hillary's with us.

608
01:17:02,495 --> 01:17:05,163
Thank God, but how ironic.

609
01:17:05,331 --> 01:17:09,459
Another day and I would have
completed my tunnel.

610
01:17:16,174 --> 01:17:17,884
Nice work.

611
01:17:41,866 --> 01:17:43,075
Nigel.

612
01:17:43,242 --> 01:17:45,245
Very clever, my darling.

613
01:17:45,411 --> 01:17:48,080
You've put the pieces together
very nicely,

614
01:17:48,206 --> 01:17:51,708
but unfortunately it's too late
for you and the others.

615
01:17:51,876 --> 01:17:55,713
- But how could you?
- It wasn't difficult.

616
01:17:55,880 --> 01:17:59,049
I could have returned to rescue you
from that wretched island,

617
01:17:59,216 --> 01:18:02,344
but it would have meant leaving
my new found comrades.

618
01:18:02,511 --> 01:18:04,513
Comrades?

619
01:18:05,514 --> 01:18:08,517
Yes, it was a Russian ship.

620
01:18:08,684 --> 01:18:12,062
They taught me all about you...
Imperialist swine.

621
01:18:12,229 --> 01:18:16,274
I was exposed to the works
of great thinkers. Karl Marx, Lenin,

622
01:18:16,442 --> 01:18:18,569
L Ron Hubbard, Freddie Laker.

623
01:18:18,735 --> 01:18:22,530
Now get in the truck.
We're going for a ride.

624
01:18:47,347 --> 01:18:49,391
Something's wrong. Where's the truck?

625
01:18:49,557 --> 01:18:51,601
- Where's Hillary?
- I'm hungry.

626
01:18:59,401 --> 01:19:01,443
What happened?

627
01:19:02,569 --> 01:19:06,282
Nigel made me go back to the meter shed.

628
01:19:06,448 --> 01:19:09,159
He ordered me to set off the alarm.

629
01:19:10,285 --> 01:19:13,496
And what does he want us to do now?

630
01:19:13,664 --> 01:19:16,416
Nothing, you numbskull, Nigel's the traitor.

631
01:19:44,736 --> 01:19:46,488
Latrine!

632
01:19:48,657 --> 01:19:52,618
Nigel took Hillary in the truck. That way.

633
01:19:52,786 --> 01:19:55,706
I cannot leave the country
without my daughter.

634
01:19:55,872 --> 01:19:59,459
I'm going after them.
I'll meet you at the landing field.

635
01:19:59,625 --> 01:20:01,710
Nick, whether you make it back or not,

636
01:20:01,878 --> 01:20:05,507
that plane must take off
with Dr Flammond at 1 8:00.

637
01:20:05,673 --> 01:20:09,051
But we recommend you be there
at least 45 minutes before departure,

638
01:20:09,218 --> 01:20:11,429
especially at this time of year.

639
01:20:11,595 --> 01:20:14,348
- Good luck, Nick.
- Let's go.

640
01:20:14,515 --> 01:20:16,059
Good luck.

641
01:20:24,984 --> 01:20:29,237
You've go to hand it to the Germans,
they make great cars.

642
01:22:57,716 --> 01:22:59,801
Goodbye.

643
01:23:30,498 --> 01:23:33,375
There's no more time.
We've got to take off now.

644
01:23:33,543 --> 01:23:35,587
I will not leave without my daughter.

645
01:23:35,753 --> 01:23:38,632
Listen, old chap,
in a few minutes it'll be dawn

646
01:23:38,798 --> 01:23:42,302
and we'll be sitting ducks
to their anti-aircraft guns.

647
01:23:42,468 --> 01:23:44,595
There they are!

648
01:23:49,266 --> 01:23:52,436
Oh, Father. Thank God, you're safe.

649
01:23:52,603 --> 01:23:55,564
How I feared I would never see you again.

650
01:23:55,731 --> 01:23:58,066
I am so proud of you, my beloved.

651
01:23:58,234 --> 01:24:01,862
There'll be time to talk on the plane.
You'd better hurry.

652
01:24:02,029 --> 01:24:05,115
- But I can't go on that plane.
- But Hillary!

653
01:24:05,282 --> 01:24:09,953
I'm needed here. For as long
as a single man is forced to cower

654
01:24:10,120 --> 01:24:12,163
under the iron fist of oppression,

655
01:24:12,331 --> 01:24:14,375
as long as a child cries out in the night,

656
01:24:14,541 --> 01:24:18,837
or an actor can be elected president,
we must continue the struggle.

657
01:24:19,004 --> 01:24:20,297
No, Hillary.

658
01:24:20,463 --> 01:24:23,383
It is too dangerous for you
in Germany, now.

659
01:24:23,551 --> 01:24:26,594
Yes, go with Nick. Don't worry about us.

660
01:24:26,762 --> 01:24:29,430
We will hear his music
on the "Voice of America".

661
01:24:29,555 --> 01:24:33,685
We will hear it in the hearts of people,
and in elevators everywhere.

662
01:24:33,852 --> 01:24:38,023
And as long as we do,
we know we are not alone in our fight.

663
01:24:38,189 --> 01:24:41,776
They're right, Hillary.
And when we get to America...

664
01:24:41,943 --> 01:24:45,196
- Who knows what will be then.
- Everything will be fine.

665
01:24:45,363 --> 01:24:51,160
Things change, people change,
hairstyles change...

666
01:24:51,327 --> 01:24:53,204
I want you to be with me.

667
01:24:53,371 --> 01:24:57,291
Interest rates fluctuate. Who knows?

668
01:24:57,459 --> 01:25:01,587
Don't you want to come with me?
If you don't, say it now.

669
01:25:01,753 --> 01:25:06,885
Want!
Want more than anything!

670
01:25:07,051 --> 01:25:10,053
Take me. Take me with you!

671
01:25:23,275 --> 01:25:27,613
Goodbye, Chocolate Mousse.
I'll never forget you.

672
01:25:27,779 --> 01:25:31,616
Goodbye, Du Quois.
Take care of yourself.

673
01:25:33,034 --> 01:25:36,955
Goodbye, Deja Vu.
I will always remember you.

674
01:25:37,121 --> 01:25:41,000
And I'll miss you, most of all, Scarecrow.
