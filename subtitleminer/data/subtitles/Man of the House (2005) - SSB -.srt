Says your source got religion
while he was in the can.

2
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,990
- You trust him?
- No.

3
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,070
Sharp, we're going to a church.

4
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,749
That's why I didn't bring a helicopter.

5
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,796
Everybody, get your hands up.

6
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,638
Now keep them up...

7
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,677
and say, "Hey!"

8
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,154
Say, "Oh!"

9
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,349
All right. Then go ahead.

10
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:28,753
We have learned from the three wise men...

11
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,999
The O'Jays...

12
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,355
Eddie, Walter, and the other guy...

13
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,433
that there is a train coming...

14
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,909
and it is a train of love.

15
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,553
Michael rowed his boat ashore.

16
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:53,950
Because he, too, wanted to get
off that water and get on the train.

17
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,639
<i>Had the ticket. </i>

18
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,238
And I, too, want to be on that same train.

19
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,870
So I will see everyone next week. Hopefully.

20
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,077
Percy Stevens. What's it been?

21
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,833
Three to five years with time off
for good behavior?

22
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,195
Sharp, how are you?

23
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,914
This is a church, all right?

24
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,798
A place that's sacred.
And it shall remain untainted.

25
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:42,350
We're looking for an old cellmate of yours,
Morgan Ball. You seen him?

26
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,112
He's a key witness in one of my cases.

27
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:47,590
Come on, man.
I don't hang with that crowd anymore.

28
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,550
I am a prophet in a non-profit world.

29
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,319
Aren't you worried about him getting away?

30
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:23,752
I'm more worried
about him having a heart attack.

31
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,034
You want me to call an ambulance for you?

32
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:55,555
Look, man, I don't even know
why I'm running in the first place.

33
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,959
I'm on God's side now.

34
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,951
Give us the phone, Percy.

35
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:03,475
Man, why are you all treating me
like I'm some little punk kid?

36
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,676
Besides, the Lord says:

37
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,638
"He who is without sin cast the first stone. "

38
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,718
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- It slipped.

39
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,316
Where's the damn phone at?

40
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,034
Holy cow!

41
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,478
It's a musical cow. Look at it. It's a miracle.

42
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,630
Like the parting of the Red Sea.

43
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,837
Or the time I saw Mike Tyson's face
in a taco.

44
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,111
What is he doing?

45
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:40,678
No. I know he's not about to do that.
Come on, man.

46
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,716
He gonna really put his hand up that cow?

47
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,758
You can't do that.
It's against the cow's rights, man.

48
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,039
What's up with the...

49
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,350
All the way... In the hand...

50
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,153
It's for you.

51
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,075
Hello.

52
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,959
Hey, Morgan. Calm down, man.

53
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,512
All units, stand by for the whereabouts
of our friend Morgan Ball.

54
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,678
They're coming in.

55
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:40,789
Texas Rangers looking for Morgan Ball!
Sure hope we don't have the wrong house!

56
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,199
Go to hell!

57
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,236
Morgan, don't run.

58
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,600
Eddie Zane, FBI.
How the hell did that fire start?

59
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,193
I don't know. We heard some shots.

60
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,669
- Who's in there?
- Sharp and Swanson.

61
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,954
Christ.

62
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,870
You know what's in those barrels, right?

63
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,349
One wrong shot and we could all go.

64
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:58,679
Look, Ball, you have three choices:

65
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,310
A: You could stay in this hellhole
and burn to death.

66
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:06,275
B: You can come with us
and testify against John Cortland.

67
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,952
A and B suck.

68
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,713
What about C?

69
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,036
C is my personal favorite.

70
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,193
Take it easy.

71
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,840
I'm sure there's a way
we can work out this whole thing.

72
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,480
Seems like it's pretty well worked out to me.

73
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,869
I got money. Lots of money.

74
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,634
If you get me out of here,
I'll make you both rich.

75
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,678
Look, see this key? It's yours.

76
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,716
Thank you. I'll put that in evidence.

77
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:33,759
Look, I can't testify.
Cortland will kill me. It's a death sentence.

78
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,790
Let's go outside and talk it over.

79
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,757
You gotta be kidding me.

80
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,668
Nice job, Sharp.

81
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:02,479
What's that they say?
"Texas Rangers always get their man"?

82
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,391
That's the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.

83
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:07,517
You both have funny hats and funny boots.
Who can tell you apart?

84
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,397
- Long time, Eddie.
- More than five years.

85
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:12,756
Margaret Swanson, Eddie Zane.
He's with the Federal Bureau of Idiots.

86
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:16,116
I'd have become a Ranger
if they said my partner would look like you.

87
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:19,272
If you were a Ranger,
you'd have caught this bastard by yourself.

88
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,557
That's the beautiful thing
about working for the federal government.

89
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:25,029
Other people do your grunt work for you.

90
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,558
- How's your daughter doing?
- Real good.

91
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,517
Excuse me, I'm bleeding here.

92
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,988
Get down!

93
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,594
You're gonna be okay.

94
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:45,194
Just hang in there. EMT is on the way.

95
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:45,317
Oh, my God, you guys. It is so hot out there.

96
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,072
I'm so hot, I think I'm sweaty.

97
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:50,357
Oh, God. I need to get some air.

98
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:58,199
Oh, my God. You guys, come here.

99
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,112
- What?
- Just come here.

100
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,157
Guys, come here.

101
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,991
I think this guy got mugged or something.

102
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,115
- What?
- Where?

103
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,316
- Should we call the cops?
- No.

104
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:14,354
I think this guy's coming to help him.

105
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,356
<i>Once again, put it together... </i>

106
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:26,070
<i>for the lovely ladies</i>
<i>of your Texas Longhorn cheer squad. </i>

107
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,954
What the hell happened?

108
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,191
I heard a shot.
I turned the corner, I got clipped.

109
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,628
- Did you get a good look at him?
- No.

110
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,515
Hello.

111
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,318
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

112
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,679
- I ordered for you.
- Good.

113
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,716
- Medium rare, right?
- Yeah.

114
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,359
How's school?

115
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,755
You know. The usual.

116
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,639
How's your mum?

117
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,756
I wouldn't really know.
She and Keith took up scuba diving.

118
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:26,152
Anyway, she was cleaning the house
and she wanted you to have these.

119
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,999
This is a beautiful picture of you
and your mum there in little bathing suits.

120
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,991
Oh, there's that donkey.

121
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:43,675
I keep looking for a picture of you and me,
but I guess I was always taking the pictures.

122
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,791
No, you were just never there.

123
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,629
Or that.

124
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:54,394
So, I'm applying to a few colleges.
Rice, SMU and...

125
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,475
Sharp.

126
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,752
Yeah, I'm on my way.

127
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:05,153
- Look, I've got to...
- Go. I get it.

128
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,235
Sorry.

129
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,069
I'm fine.

130
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:25,479
- Looks like you've been busy.
- Yes, sir.

131
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,316
- Hell, ain't it?
- Yes, sir.

132
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,397
They said you had some witnesses.

133
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,994
Yeah, they came waltzing in here
about a half hour ago.

134
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,433
Said they saw the whole thing.

135
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,590
- Anybody else know about this?
- No.

136
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:39,319
Can we keep it that way?
I'm tired of being shot at.

137
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,594
You bet.

138
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,677
Who are your witnesses?

139
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,639
Cheerleaders.

140
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,070
<i>You know, I think we could be on the news. </i>

141
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:52,948
<i>I'm not talking local. </i>
<i>I'm thinking maybe Katie Couric or Oprah. </i>

142
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,197
<i>We shouldn't have come here. </i>

143
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,634
<i>I need to get to the library. </i>

144
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,474
<i>Now I'll never get my psych paper done. </i>
<i>I'll just keep seeing his head explode. </i>

145
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,039
<i>Evie, remember what we said?</i>

146
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:05,999
<i>You got to breathe. </i>
<i>Let air in, and now let that air out, okay?</i>

147
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,078
I totally have a double chin.

148
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,229
I don't trust cops.

149
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,675
We shouldn't say anything
till our lawyers get here.

150
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,228
<i>We don't need lawyers. </i>
<i>We didn't do anything. </i>

151
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,357
<i>Relax, everybody. </i>
<i>We just came here to tell them what we saw. </i>

152
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,396
- Do we have to?
- Yes.

153
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:22,757
As cheerleaders,
we're role models to the community at large.

154
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:25,638
If we don't do the right thing,
how can we expect others to?

155
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,199
Now I'm gonna throw up.

156
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,714
I'm not gonna be staying here all night long.

157
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:33,429
Why don't we just tell these people
that we need to reschedule for tomorrow?

158
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,875
Well, I can't do morning.
I'm having my legs waxed.

159
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,518
I have a biochem lab at noon.

160
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,592
I'm good between 2:30 and 4:00.
Would that work for everybody?

161
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,238
Don't work for me.

162
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,595
And who are you?

163
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,989
Roland Sharp, Texas Ranger.

164
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,958
Oh, my God. Do you know Derek Jeter?

165
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,396
No, he means the other Texas Rangers.
You know, like the Lone Ranger.

166
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,313
He had that cool Indian friend.
What was his name?

167
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,469
Tonto?

168
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,472
He was hot.
Why don't guys wear loincloths anymore?

169
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:03,269
A Texas Ranger was shot this evening
in connection to the murder you witnessed.

170
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,749
Anything you remember,
no matter how insignificant...

171
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:08,070
may be of the utmost importance.

172
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,831
- Do you want a piece?
- No, I do not.

173
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,478
- You don't like gum?
- No.

174
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:19,348
Chewing gum is the most significant factor
in the decline of Western civilization.

175
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,668
The decline of what?

176
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:23,513
When people chew gum,
nobody can read their expressions.

177
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,113
Like with BOTOX.

178
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:36,428
I like an older man
who knows what he wants.

179
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,634
All right.

180
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,356
We should so not get involved in this.

181
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,396
Oh, God, here she goes again.

182
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,755
- She do this a lot?
- Whenever she gets nervous.

183
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:48,229
She drops, like, 10 pounds around finals.

184
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,231
Can anybody describe the perpetrator?

185
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,639
"Perpetrator"?

186
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,031
The bad man with the gun.

187
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,111
Actually, he was kind of cute.

188
00:15:56,200 --> 00:16:00,318
Gross. He was a total skank.
On a scale of 1 to 10, I'd give him a 4.

189
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:03,437
No, a ruthless killer's kind of sexy.
I give him an 8.

190
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:06,159
Let's try to concentrate. How tall was he?

191
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,878
Average. Like, 5'10".

192
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,678
No way. 6'2" at least.

193
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,432
I thought he was kind of short.

194
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,078
What about his hair?

195
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,718
Definitely needs to rethink his cut.

196
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:19,396
- I mean the color of his hair.
- It was dark. Almost black.

197
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,754
I thought it was blond.

198
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:23,229
- What?
- This is bad.

199
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,112
Did he have any...

200
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:29,877
distinctive facial characteristics?

201
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:38,638
Sideburns? A moustache?

202
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,156
- There might've been a moustache.
- No, definitely not.

203
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,794
Was I the only one who saw a goatee?

204
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,872
Look at these guys.

205
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,639
You guys, wait.

206
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:07,193
Wait. Looks like your ex-boyfriend,
Brook Burton.

207
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,879
No, he doesn't.

208
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,919
Morning, Cap.

209
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:13,759
The Dixie Chicks here...

210
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:18,311
looked at 5,759 mug shots last night.

211
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,119
<i>Wee. Look at this bad boy. </i>

212
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,555
<i>He is yummy!</i>

213
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:28,269
<i>He's kind of a cross between</i>
<i>the Unabomber and Mark Wahlberg. </i>

214
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,997
I now know the hottie rating
of every ex-convict...

215
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,196
in the western United States.

216
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:39,591
Been up all night,
haven't learned a goddamn thing.

217
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,794
<i>Please tell me this sweet thing</i>
<i>is out on parole. </i>

218
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,711
<i>Look at him. He's fine. </i>

219
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,789
<i>Girl, good. </i>

220
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:49,350
<i>Oh, my God, you guys,</i>
<i>I think this guy is in my poli- sci class. </i>

221
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:52,950
They all said they could ID that feller
if they saw him again.

222
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:03,114
That's a two-way mirror, girl.
People are watching you.

223
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,749
I know.

224
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,232
What do you think?

225
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,911
I don't know what to think.

226
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,518
I feel really...

227
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,515
old.

228
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,594
Excuse me, Captain.

229
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:35,719
The Governor's office just called.

230
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,355
Good.

231
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,596
Thanks for coming, fellas.

232
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:50,434
I'm getting phone calls from some daddies
that are worried about their daughters.

233
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,397
They have good reason to be concerned, sir.

234
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,189
If Cortland finds out there are witnesses,
he'll come after them sure as hell.

235
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:59,989
Gentlemen, I told those guys we'd take care
of their daughters. Stay with them.

236
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,150
- Yes, sir.
- Good luck, Roland.

237
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:32,112
Is the taller blond Anne or Barb?
I can't remember their names.

238
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,713
- HE-BAT.
- "He" what?

239
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,438
HE-BAT. It's a mnemonic device, son.

240
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,353
Heather, Evie, Barbara, Anne, Teresa.
HE-BAT.

241
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,871
This is a plainclothes operation.

242
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,872
Take your hat off. Conceal your badge.
Try to look normal.

243
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:47,953
Yes, sir. And I just want to say thank you
for taking me along on this one, sir.

244
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:50,190
That's the third time today
you've thanked me...

245
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:54,432
and I can honestly say at this point
I feel the full brunt of your gratitude.

246
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,639
Thank you again, sir.

247
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,392
Get in the damn van.

248
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,793
You, move over.

249
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,551
You think you could turn some music on
or something?

250
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,190
- Turn the motor off.
- Problem, sir?

251
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,713
We don't have a secure cabin.

252
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,633
This vehicle will not move
until all these ladies buckle up.

253
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18,755
You're kidding, right?

254
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:23,231
One thing you'll learn about me is
I do not kid, or jest, or joke, or jape...

255
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,709
or quip.

256
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,079
Looks like we're waiting on you, Teresa.

257
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,359
I saw that.

258
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,313
I saw that, too.

259
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,958
I see everything.

260
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:58,395
Mr. Cortland, do you expect
any further charges to be filed against you?

261
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:01,358
Mr. Cortland,
how do you feel about the verdict?

262
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,317
After failing to produce any evidence...

263
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:06,392
the government has dropped all charges
against John W. Cortland.

264
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,040
Needless to say,
my client is pleased with this outcome.

265
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,953
What about the murder
of a key government witness last night?

266
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:15,396
If you'll excuse us, Mr. Cortland
is anxious to get home to his family.

267
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,469
No further comment.

268
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,710
Are you denying any prior knowledge?

269
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,149
Zane.

270
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:36,152
<i>It's me. I still don't have the money</i>
<i>Ball stole from me. </i>

271
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,674
<i>And the shooter you brought in</i>
<i>shot a Ranger. </i>

272
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,751
I covered for him. The job got done.

273
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:43,752
<i>Even shot myself in the arm. </i>
<i>You're a free man. </i>

274
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:47,150
Yeah, well, here's the thing.
You left some witnesses.

275
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,197
Hey, pull up over here.

276
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:58,317
Now you listen here.
You better start cleaning this mess up.

277
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,358
Already on it.

278
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,155
I got to shower.

279
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,437
Triple-lock all the doors,
put magnetic contacts on all the windows.

280
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,794
I only want one port of entry.

281
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:44,555
Y'all can put your audio and visual stuff
upstairs and downstairs.

282
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,519
I want you to check all the crawl spaces,
if they got any, for outside access.

283
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:52,639
Put a tap on that telephone and a bunch
of Barq's Root Beer in the refrigerator.

284
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,358
Where do you want your stuff at, sir?

285
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,590
On the couch in the front room,
facing the door.

286
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:59,069
Yes, sir. Where do we bed down, sir?

287
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:02,154
With that bunch of scholars over there.

288
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,994
Have fun.

289
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:20,389
Ladies, if I might have y'all assemble
in the living area.

290
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,710
Is my root beer in the refrigerator?

291
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,799
Root beer? No, sir.

292
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,757
Then why are you still here?

293
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,193
Antonio? Baby! Where are you?

294
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,118
- It's her boyfriend.
- It's a very co-dependent relationship.

295
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,237
Well, at least I have a relationship.
What do you have? Nothing.

296
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,039
Antonio.
Teresa's gonna have to get back to you.

297
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:05,793
You couldn't possibly be talking about
my mother because she's allergic to dogs.

298
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:09,031
- First rule: No cell phones.
- What?

299
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:12,874
No pagers, no Palm Pilots and no e-mail.

300
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:17,033
And the telephone downstairs may be used
in the event of emergencies only.

301
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,473
Give it up.

302
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,955
Send us back to the Stone Age,
why don't you?

303
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:23,349
You don't understand
what serious business this is.

304
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,637
In order for us to do our job,
we're gonna need your cooperation...

305
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,836
and that means paying attention
to what I say...

306
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:31,480
and doing what I ask you to do
when I ask you to do it.

307
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:34,950
Furthermore, I'd appreciate it
if you'd cover yourselves in our presence.

308
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,712
I realize how very proud you are...

309
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,758
of your tattoos, piercings,
and other body modifications.

310
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,354
However, my colleagues and I
do not need to see these.

311
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,634
Are there any questions?

312
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:46,473
I have one. Are you always such a dick?

313
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:49,438
Yes. There will be no guests
in the house ever.

314
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,318
Nobody may leave the house
without an escort.

315
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,833
But this is our house.

316
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:56,673
What about classes?
I'm in an advanced pre-med program.

317
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,876
- I have a...
- 4.0, we know.

318
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,748
Okay, guys. If I miss my biochem class,
I'm gonna lose my scholarship.

319
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,432
There are five of y'all, three of us.

320
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:07,751
You'll have to pare your schedules down
to the absolute essentials.

321
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,559
I'll skip all my classes
for the greater good of the group.

322
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,039
Work it out amongst yourselves.

323
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:14,759
- What about dates? Barb's got two tonight.
- Not anymore.

324
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:17,035
Hello! We've got a game on Saturday.

325
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,350
Don't even think about telling us
we're not going.

326
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,714
You're not going.

327
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,028
Don't say it.

328
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:26,591
As captain of this squad, I must inform you
that to stop us from cheerleading...

329
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:30,468
you're gonna have to pry the pom-poms
from our cold, dead hands.

330
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,833
I'm all clear.

331
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:53,717
Come on, Asst. Cheerleading Coach Sharp,
show me your spirit.

332
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,313
Where's your happy face?

333
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,152
This is my happy face.

334
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:01,355
Well, I think we're gonna have to turn
that frown upside down.

335
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:06,350
Now this cannot be how you helped
Florida State to the regional finals.

336
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:09,030
- Coach Beauregard?
- Please, Binky.

337
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,394
Okay, Binky.

338
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,550
I specialize in strength and conditioning...

339
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,757
and I'm gonna leave the grinning
and the smiling up to you.

340
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:19,628
Well, okey-dokey then.
Assignment accepted.

341
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,194
<i>Time-out... </i>

342
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,475
<i>Texas. </i>

343
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,235
Gun!

344
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,315
A water gun, sir.

345
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,709
Please don't hurt me. It's just a joke.

346
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,468
Nice hit!

347
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,599
Check it out.

348
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,038
Howdy, neighbor.

349
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,631
I'm Jimmy from next door.

350
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:38,316
Just wanted to come by
and welcome you to the building.

351
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:42,479
And, you know,
if you need any weed or anything...

352
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,476
just come bang on my door.

353
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:49,031
That's good to know, Jimmy.

354
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,033
- You'll definitely be hearing from us.
- Cool.

355
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,713
2200 hours.

356
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,313
<i>HE-BAT is secure. </i>

357
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:01,198
Roger that. We'll see y'all in the morning.

358
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,393
I don't sleep.

359
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,197
Isn't that your partner?

360
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,431
- Shouldn't you have gone to the hospital?
- No.

361
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,554
I'm here.

362
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,956
Right. But she's been shot.

363
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,871
That's part of the job.

364
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,636
You ever kill anyone, Sharp?

365
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:54,399
Cold bastard probably doesn't even care.

366
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,351
Her middle name is Ellen.

367
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,589
A lot of the fellas weren't happy when
the Rangers started recruiting women...

368
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,830
and I was sure enough one of them.

369
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,352
She changed my mind.

370
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,271
I also hear everything.

371
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:26,636
"The brightness of her cheek
would shame those stars

372
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,711
"As daylight doth a lamp

373
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:31,030
"her eyes in heaven

374
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,350
"Would through the airy region
stream so bright

375
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:36,876
"That birds would sing
and think it were not night"

376
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:41,878
So your assignment is
to write a five-page paper...

377
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,678
due a week from Friday...

378
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:46,797
describing the function
of the recurrent imagery...

379
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,952
of light against darkness
in <i>Romeo and Juliet. </i>

380
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:53,032
What does it mean? How does it mean it?

381
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:56,240
And is it possible that this play...

382
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:59,796
is more than just a teenage romance
with a sad ending?

383
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:06,949
Miss Thompson.
I want to see you in my office. Now.

384
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,390
- She'd like to see you.
- What for?

385
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,913
I don't know.

386
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:26,957
Mr. Sharp. Come in. Have a seat.

387
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:35,357
So, I understand you're
the new assistant cheerleading coach.

388
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,429
That's right.

389
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,431
May I ask what you were doing in my class?

390
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:42,593
That's the way we do things on our squad.
If somebody's in the...

391
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,671
Let me be blunt, Mr. Sharp.

392
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:47,752
Barb's cheerleading
is interfering with her work.

393
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,197
And for the record, you should know
I think cheerleading is stupid.

394
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:53,510
I couldn't agree with you more.

395
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:58,519
She downloaded this paper
on plant imagery in <i>Macbeth... </i>

396
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,153
off the Internet.

397
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:04,233
I know, because I wrote it 20 years ago
when I was an undergraduate.

398
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,636
Must be a hell of a paper.

399
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,909
Yes, I thought it was pretty good.

400
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:14,792
But that is not the point.
Plagiarism is simply not acceptable.

401
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:17,435
I've given Barb an F on that assignment.

402
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:21,195
If she wants to remain on the squad,
or in the school, for that matter...

403
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:24,795
her next paper on <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>
had better be wholly original.

404
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,552
I'll explain your position to Barb...

405
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,757
and make sure she understands it,
explicitly.

406
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,359
Well, good.

407
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:34,909
Fine.

408
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:40,677
Okay, what's the big deal?
Presidents don't write their speeches.

409
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:44,230
When you're President, you can be
as lenient as you want to on plagiarism.

410
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,276
But wait. This play has five acts.

411
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:48,396
She can't expect me to read the whole thing.

412
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,948
It's all written in ye olde
weird English anyway.

413
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:53,600
- Hey, Barb.
- Hi, Scoot.

414
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:58,078
Besides, people think being a cheerleader
is this nonstop party and everything...

415
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,957
but, you know, they're so wrong.

416
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,837
- Hey, Barb.
- Hi, Chase.

417
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,310
Aside from all my games and my practices...

418
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:08,154
they still expect me to maintain
this 2.0 average, and I can't do that.

419
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,832
You need to manage your time better.

420
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:13,117
Time? What time? I don't have any time.

421
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,475
- Hey, Barb.
- Hi, Tim.

422
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:18,393
- Tom.
- Shoot! Sorry. Tom.

423
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,074
I really liked him, too.

424
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:22,549
You got some admirers on this campus,
don't you?

425
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:25,200
Don't be jealous. They're just silly boys.

426
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:28,078
We can stop this charade
and run away together.

427
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,673
You got a paper to write.

428
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,320
I know. But if I write it myself,
it'll just be stupid.

429
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,436
You don't know that
because you haven't tried.

430
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:36,909
Cheating is a hell of a lot worse
than being stupid.

431
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:41,278
Plagiarism is an academic crime.
It is punishable by academic death.

432
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,069
What do you care anyway?

433
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:48,153
I wanna see you stay alive, academically,
physically, and every other way.

434
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,956
- You like me, don't you?
- No.

435
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,391
<i>Guys, stand by one moment. </i>

436
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,911
Sergeant, your pizza's here.

437
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:28,479
Roger that.

438
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:33,832
Set the pizza on the porch...

439
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:37,390
take two steps back,
and place your hands behind your head.

440
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:55,389
What's the problem, dude?

441
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:58,199
If that pizza's hot,
there won't be any problem.

442
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:12,232
- All right, what do I owe you?
- $13.75.

443
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,759
Hey, do you live here with all these girls?

444
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,193
Temporarily.

445
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,231
Dude, you're my new hero.

446
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,550
Imagine what that means to me.

447
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,916
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

448
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:39,072
Without my phone, I am nothing,
I am worthless.

449
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,555
I need to speak to my Antonio...

450
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:47,436
- What is that?
- The Carnivore.

451
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:52,471
Pepperoni, sausage, ground beef, ham, and
olive loaf, all together in one savory pie.

452
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,399
With jalapeños.

453
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,557
- Want some?
- Yes. No.

454
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,438
Extra-thick crust.

455
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,511
- I can't. I'm on the Zone.
- What zone?

456
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:04,273
The proper combination
of protein, fat, and carbohydrates.

457
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,998
This combination's proper as hell.

458
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,433
I'm a total Atkins girl.

459
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,748
I do Weight Watchers.

460
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:11,752
You'll probably blow all your daily points
with just one bite.

461
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:16,231
This baby has one point and one point only,
and that is tasting good.

462
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:20,712
I don't know why you girls are on a diet.
You couldn't weigh any more than...

463
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,713
Don't even go there.

464
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,189
No, there are some things
we just don't discuss.

465
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,111
My daughter has a very healthy appetite.

466
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,589
Interesting. You never mentioned
you had a daughter.

467
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:30,795
- What's her name?
- Emma.

468
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,393
- How old is she?
- Seventeen.

469
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,118
- Is she a cheerleader?
- I hope not.

470
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,953
- What's her favorite band?
- You got me.

471
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,393
How about her sign?

472
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,152
Is she sexually active?

473
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,992
- Hell, no.
- She probably is.

474
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:44,674
68% of high-school students
in Texas have had sex...

475
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,716
by the time they've reached the 12th grade.

476
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,836
Slightly higher than the national average.

477
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,319
Thank you for ruining my day.

478
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:53,597
I'll tell you one thing about this daughter
you know nothing about.

479
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:57,559
She must be supremely messed up
in the head from living in a house with you.

480
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,232
She lives with her mother.

481
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,753
Why did your marriage fall apart?

482
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:03,638
That's one of many things
that you and I will never discuss.

483
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:06,632
You see, you clearly don't know
how to speak to women.

484
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:10,315
I know how to speak to women.
I clearly choose not to.

485
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:42,958
We need to establish
this bathroom at the end of the hall...

486
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,871
is a 100% masculine bathroom.

487
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:48,999
From this moment on, it is off-limits to
you people and your foolish undergarments.

488
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:51,753
- You want an egg-white omelette?
- Does that mean no yolks?

489
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,068
- No yolks.
- No, thanks.

490
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,878
- Want some kamut flakes?
- What?

491
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:58,157
- Ancient grain. Tastes great with soymilk.
- Soymilk.

492
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:03,754
- Who ate all my kamut flakes?
- Not me.

493
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:07,799
What am I,
the Organization to End World Hunger?

494
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:10,155
This is my cereal.

495
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:14,679
Why do you girls find it necessary
to listen to this constant crap?

496
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,872
You don't like vagina music?

497
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:20,350
Do you have to use that word
before I've had my coffee and soymilk?

498
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:22,874
- Vagina.
- Whose?

499
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:27,115
- What did I tell y'all about wearing clothes?
- Jog bras are clothes.

500
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,554
That's it.

501
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:32,355
That is it.

502
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,792
Just sign right there.

503
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,553
- Awful big unit for a house this size.
- I get hot.

504
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:06,959
I hear you.

505
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:33,915
All right. You win, okay?
We all agree to put on more clothes.

506
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,911
Now, can you please
turn the temperature up?

507
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,639
That's a very mature decision
and I'm proud of you girls.

508
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,790
But we should come
to a common understanding...

509
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:43,792
the meaning, the definition
of the word "more. "

510
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,958
We thought you might say that.

511
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:47,109
Barb!

512
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:53,033
All righty.
This is Courtney Ryan, my personal hero.

513
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:57,468
Like Courtney, we feel we should not
be penalized for maximizing our assets.

514
00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:00,791
However, we've all agreed to cover up...

515
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,992
these areas here...

516
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,992
and this area right here.

517
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,115
Good.

518
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:10,274
But what about these other problem areas?

519
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:12,269
Here...

520
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,189
here...

521
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,234
and here.

522
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:19,072
You're killing me.

523
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,394
Come here.

524
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,235
All right. We'll cave on the first two.

525
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:33,675
But we absolutely must maintain
navel visibility.

526
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,751
We want to be realistic, not Amish.

527
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,671
- One inch on either side.
- Three.

528
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,113
- Two.
- Done.

529
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,956
<i>These girls are a different kettle of worms. </i>

530
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:54,838
Something just came up. I'll get back to you.

531
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,309
I need to speak to your witnesses.

532
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,752
Eddie, how's the arm?

533
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:05,752
Let's not change the subject.

534
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,273
There are no witnesses.

535
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:10,477
Even if there was, I couldn't let you
talk to them. You know that.

536
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:13,028
Come on, Captain,
we're on the same team here.

537
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:14,758
I think I can help.

538
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:17,912
At least let me talk to Sharp.
That was him on the phone, right?

539
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,230
Sharp's in the field right now.

540
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:21,829
Right.

541
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:25,428
Your Ranger screwed up my whole case.

542
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:27,915
He blew up that lab
and all the evidence in it.

543
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,673
Ball is dead
and I got shot in the arm, for Christ's sake.

544
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:35,151
I need to speak to those witnesses.
So I'm asking you again. Where are they?

545
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:44,554
This "One Riot, One Ranger" shit won't fly
when I slap a subpoena on your desk.

546
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,471
My desk's already a mess.

547
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:49,757
One more piece of paper
won't make me no never mind.

548
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:54,956
Circle the wagons if you want.
This is a federal case.

549
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:19,080
- You learn quick.
- Five years of college.

550
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:21,913
$13.75, right? Here's $14. Keep the change.

551
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,672
How's my favorite pep-squad leader?

552
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:32,795
What?

553
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:35,030
I said, how's my favorite
pep-squad leader?

554
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:38,749
Not real peppy.
Would somebody turn that music down?

555
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:40,715
Hang on, Cap.

556
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,791
Is there any more pizza left?

557
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:49,440
Somebody, please turn that music off!

558
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:51,033
Throw this away.

559
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:58,670
I cannot hear myself think.

560
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:04,995
Okay, as we involuntarily enter
into this enforced period of silence...

561
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:07,753
can I ask if there's any medication
you forgot to take...

562
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:09,831
or some I might recommend you should try?

563
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,036
Yes. Like take a chill pill.

564
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:13,912
I only need one witness.

565
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,149
Get out.

566
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,155
What's up, Cap?

567
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:21,516
It's a subpoena from your buddy Zane.
The feds want our witnesses.

568
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:23,750
<i>We're now officially in contempt. </i>

569
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:27,719
Don't worry. If Cortland don't send
somebody to kill them soon, I'll do it myself.

570
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:31,588
One other thing.
I got this invoice here for an air conditioner.

571
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:35,832
$7,572.44.

572
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:37,035
Can you explain that to me?

573
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:38,951
I'll have to get back to you on that one.

574
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:40,519
Where do you think you're going?

575
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:42,830
To the Cactus Cafe.
Asleep at the Wheel's playing.

576
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:45,957
Too many people. You know the rules.
Nobody goes out after dark.

577
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:49,112
We're young, we're strong,
and we're tired of being cooped up.

578
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,919
I haven't had phone sex with my boyfriend
in almost a week.

579
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,149
I have oats to plow.

580
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:55,310
You got oats to sow,
and it ain't gonna happen.

581
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:59,598
Like hell it's not. What's to stop me
from walking out that door? The <i>Tontos?</i>

582
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:01,352
I eat men like that for breakfast.

583
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:04,910
And what, you?
I'd like to see you try it, Mr. Ranger-man.

584
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:08,229
Come on.

585
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:25,280
Anybody else wanna go see
Asleep at the Wheel?

586
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:30,591
You think he needs backup?

587
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:32,669
No.

588
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:35,391
I think he can handle it.

589
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:50,070
Let me guess, Clay.
You're looking for Jimmy.

590
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:55,395
Totally. Dude, are you like a psychic
or some kind of shit?

591
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:57,792
Some kind of shit.

592
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:59,353
The thing is...

593
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:00,993
Jimmy moved.

594
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:03,709
- Where to?
- Travis County Jailhouse.

595
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:06,078
That ain't good.

596
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:17,198
Okay, a hairdo this phenomenal
only happens twice a year.

597
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:20,598
Please. It really needs to be shared
with the world.

598
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:23,478
- What if we have to go to the bathroom?
- Go ahead.

599
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:25,158
You're evil, you know that?

600
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:27,435
Face it, girl. You're with me tonight.

601
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:29,158
We didn't ask for this.

602
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:31,913
We just went into the bathroom
and saw a guy die.

603
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,788
We could've kept quiet, but we didn't.
I feel like we're getting punished for it.

604
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:39,077
- Sorry, but you're not being punished.
- Then let us out of here.

605
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:42,277
Even prisoners on death row
get a little yard time.

606
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:45,637
- How about the mall?
- Shopping with y'all? I don't think so.

607
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:47,995
- What about a movie?
- Not in the mood.

608
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:51,629
As captain of the cheerleading squad,
I demand that you take us someplace...

609
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:54,757
where you can protect us
and we can have some fun.

610
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:22,758
Look who's skating!

611
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:34,790
Last time I was here, it was Emma's
sixth birthday. She loved this place.

612
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:36,677
You don't speak to her much, do you?

613
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:38,478
I don't think Emma wants to talk to me.

614
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:42,348
Every girl wants to talk to her dad.
She may act like she doesn't, but she does.

615
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:46,069
Everything I say around her is wrong.
I've been wrong since she turned 11.

616
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:48,993
Maybe you're just not asking her
the right questions.

617
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:51,548
First of all, never ask, "So how's school?"

618
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:54,837
Nope. Dumb question. It's too easy.
Our brains just shut off.

619
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:58,754
And don't become her best friend.
We have enough friends, thank you.

620
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:00,512
What do you wish you could say to her?

621
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:02,591
That I wish I could see her more...

622
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:05,717
and I'm sorry it didn't work out
between her mother and me...

623
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:08,633
and it wasn't her fault, and stuff like that.

624
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:11,837
If my daddy told me them things,
I'd be the happiest girl alive.

625
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:14,480
I haven't seen my dad
since he left me nine years ago.

626
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:15,834
I'm sorry that happened to you.

627
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:18,559
You have a daughter and you love her.
You should tell her.

628
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:21,950
Yeah, maybe you should take her
skating again, because you know what?

629
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:24,076
You're getting pretty good.

630
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:25,833
I am getting the hang of it.

631
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:30,072
All right, we're going to let you go.
Show us your funky groove. Come on, boy!

632
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:34,069
All right! Yes, sir!

633
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:40,830
- Are you okay?
- That was bad.

634
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,433
Morning, Emma.

635
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:50,789
Mr. Zane?

636
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:52,871
Look at you, you're all grown up.

637
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:55,235
Yeah. Wow, it's been a long time.

638
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:56,355
Sure has.

639
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:57,475
What are you doing here?

640
00:47:57,560 --> 00:48:00,154
I'm looking for your father.
It's a professional matter.

641
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:02,037
You got any idea where I might find him?

642
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:04,350
No. He doesn't really tell me anything.

643
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:06,112
What happened to your arm?

644
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:08,794
It's just one of the hazards of the job.

645
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:11,480
You wouldn't happen
to have a number on him, would you?

646
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:12,629
Is he in trouble?

647
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:15,792
No. It's just that I'm working on a case
and I need his help.

648
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:17,632
If I need to get ahold of him...

649
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:21,508
I usually call dispatch and
they patch me through on a restricted line.

650
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:23,716
- I'll give that a try then.
- Okay.

651
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:25,870
- Good to see you again.
- Bye.

652
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:31,878
Sharp, look here.

653
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:35,472
Remember that John Doe
they pulled out of a rest stop last week?

654
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:38,552
Rifle from his trunk matches the bullet
they dug out of Swanson.

655
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:41,234
Is this the fella y'all see shoot Morgan Ball?

656
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:44,438
No. The guy who shot Ball
seemed a lot nicer.

657
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:46,033
And a lot less dead.

658
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:48,429
- It was like Ball knew him or something.
- Knew him?

659
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:52,195
Yeah. If you're through playing detective,
can you get us home so we can rest?

660
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:53,315
Nope.

661
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:54,719
- Please?
- Come on.

662
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:56,069
Load up.

663
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,879
Yeah, I like that.
That's where we're gonna kill them.

664
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:21,953
Remind me to take a collection
right after that.

665
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:24,600
That's gonna be a good time
to get the money.

666
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:27,194
Well, if it ain't Martin Luther Vandross.

667
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:30,556
Why don't you all take a break.
Everybody go ahead, real quick.

668
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:33,598
This man's probably got
a lot of sins he needs to confess.

669
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:35,398
Probably may have to exorcise him.

670
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:37,596
Y'all go about your business.

671
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:40,551
Can't you see
I'm doing the Lord's business?

672
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:42,232
You know this guy?

673
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:45,792
I mean, that is...

674
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:48,917
He got roughed up.
That is pretty bad right there.

675
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:51,196
- Is he dead?
- He way dead.

676
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:55,071
Yeah, I mean, looks like a guy
that was in the can with me.

677
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:58,038
Think his name's Jack Carter.

678
00:49:58,120 --> 00:49:59,314
He work for Cortland?

679
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:01,960
No. He was more of a freelance artist...

680
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:04,759
if you know what I'm saying.

681
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:11,035
Looks like Cortland hired a second shooter.
Pull up Jack Carter, see what we got on him.

682
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:15,592
So, you girls are cheerleaders, huh?

683
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:20,238
Y'all recognize me? It's me, Percy.

684
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:24,039
Yeah. Percy "Pirouette"...

685
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:26,114
Stevens.

686
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:29,351
Class of '89. I was bad. I was a bad man.

687
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:33,237
Y'all think that's funny? I'm good. Okay.

688
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:36,830
All right, you think that's funny?
You wait one second.

689
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:56,037
"Ungawa, Texas got the power

690
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:58,236
"I said, yes"

691
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:04,069
Yeah, that was real fresh, Bobby Brown.

692
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:05,388
Oh, yeah?

693
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:07,717
Yeah, let me tell you something.

694
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:09,836
Now, I may have missed the '90s...

695
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:12,997
due to a previous engagement...

696
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:15,875
but back in my day, we brought it.

697
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:19,072
Oh, yeah. I'm talking real old school.

698
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:22,272
Not like that little tired crap you trot out to.

699
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:25,477
A- G-G-I-E.

700
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:27,392
What's that spell?

701
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:29,038
What's that smell?

702
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:31,229
Ladies.

703
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:34,596
- All set?
- You bet.

704
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:38,912
"More power, more power
more power to the hour

705
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,595
"More bounce, more bounce
more bounce to the ounce"

706
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:43,874
Boring.

707
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:47,398
"Hot, now show us what you got"

708
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:42,432
Now that's old school.

709
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:58,315
<i>Hello?</i>

710
00:52:58,400 --> 00:52:59,435
- Hi, Emma, it's...
<i>- Psych!</i>

711
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:01,909
<i>You got my machine. You know what to do. </i>

712
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:05,390
Hey, Emma, it's your father.

713
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:07,509
Dad.

714
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,991
I was just calling to see how you're doing.

715
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:14,629
It's kind of hard to reach me right now.
I'm working on a case.

716
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:20,757
You know, like I'm always doing.
Just working on a case.

717
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:26,918
Anyway, I'd like to talk to you.
So call me. You know how to reach me.

718
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:31,709
If you feel like it.
There's no pressure or anything like that.

719
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:35,154
You know.

720
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:41,318
- So I guess that's it.
- Tell her you miss her.

721
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:44,117
Except, I miss you, baby.

722
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:47,713
Can I help you?

723
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:49,876
Teresa had a visit from her little friend.

724
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:52,349
What did I tell you people about visitors?

725
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:55,398
Not that kind of visitor. Her menses.

726
00:53:55,720 --> 00:53:58,678
- The curse of Eve. The crimson tide.
- I get it.

727
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:02,230
So, someone has to go shopping.
Do you want me to go?

728
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:04,199
<i>Holt, get over here. </i>

729
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:06,271
<i>I'm going out for some air. </i>

730
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:17,151
<i>Attention. </i>
<i>Price check on register three, please. </i>

731
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:40,511
Can't make up your mind?

732
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:45,153
Do I need the slim fit, the regular protection
or the one with wings?

733
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:48,198
The ones with the wings. Definitely.

734
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:53,950
Cucumber-melon body spray.

735
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:56,315
Vanilla-smoothie bikini cream.

736
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:58,795
Sounds like a busy and painful night
for your wife.

737
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:00,552
I'm divorced. These are for the girls.

738
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:03,677
The cheerleaders?
You do their shopping for them?

739
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:07,034
You are a curious fella, Mr. Sharp. You gay?

740
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:09,509
No. Girls are all tied up, studying.

741
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:12,520
I volunteered to help out
and pick up a few things.

742
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:15,398
Are you sleeping with any
or possibly all of these girls?

743
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:16,469
No.

744
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:18,357
Wanna have dinner with me
tomorrow night?

745
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:19,668
Negative.

746
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:23,477
- Negative?
- It's not really possible, with work and all.

747
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:27,397
Well, okay, that plane just flew
into the side of the mountain.

748
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:30,711
Call off the search, no survivors.
Have a pleasant evening.

749
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:48,039
These yours?

750
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:52,390
- Yes.
- You left them on the counter.

751
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:54,034
Thank you.

752
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:03,074
Thank you.

753
00:56:03,160 --> 00:56:05,310
I think I made a mistake back there.

754
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:06,753
Didn't want the wings after all?

755
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:09,513
No. In regard to dinner.
It's not that I don't want to.

756
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:12,114
It's hard for me to get away
with my busy schedule...

757
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:14,998
as an assistant cheerleading coach.

758
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:18,791
This whole cheerleading thing
must be a really tough racket.

759
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:20,438
You have no idea.

760
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:22,114
Anyway, I was thinking...

761
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:25,875
maybe you could come over
to the house tomorrow and I'll fix dinner.

762
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:32,149
Okay.

763
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:35,552
- 8:00?
- Yeah, good.

764
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:43,275
By the way, I'm Molly.

765
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:44,959
I'm Roland.

766
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:55,033
You're not on the Zone or counting points
or anything like that, are you?

767
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:56,629
No.

768
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:05,231
Is that the North Star?

769
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:10,112
No. I think that's an airplane.
You see the way it's moving?

770
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:13,152
That's the North Star.

771
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:16,109
So that's where they've been keeping it.

772
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:19,674
Someday I want to do more
than look at the stars.

773
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:21,876
I'm fixing to soar with them.

774
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:24,714
What, you mean,
like an astronaut or something?

775
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:28,076
No, not exactly. Not a living one, at least.

776
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:30,835
They got this company out of Beaumont...

777
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:33,753
and they will launch your remains
right out into outer space.

778
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:35,956
Really? I love shit like that.

779
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:38,349
- But how?
- What they do is they park you...

780
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:40,749
Holt, what the hell are you doing?

781
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:45,398
Contemplating the vastness
of the universe, sir.

782
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:59,398
It's supposed to be red.
Does this look like red to you?

783
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:02,438
Just shoot her, Sharp.
You'd be doing her a favor.

784
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:05,149
- Where are Teresa and Anne?
- I don't know.

785
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:06,593
You're lying.

786
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:09,150
- How do you know?
- You broke eye contact.

787
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:11,390
It's a sign of stress and possible deception.

788
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:14,313
So is picking at your clothes.
Stop picking at your clothes.

789
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:16,550
Look me in the eye
and tell me where they're at.

790
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:18,551
Teresa and Antonio had a really big fight.

791
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:22,428
She had to blow off some steam,
so they went to the Buffalo Billiards.

792
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:24,715
You stay here.

793
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:27,519
Don't be contemplating the universe
with anybody.

794
00:58:40,840 --> 00:58:43,638
Look, a native approaches.
Avoid eye contact.

795
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:51,357
You guys are the cheerleaders, right?
The ones with the calendar?

796
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:52,475
Nope.

797
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:55,552
Could have sworn you were June.
June kicks ass.

798
00:58:55,720 --> 00:58:57,312
Sorry, wrong girl.

799
00:58:57,400 --> 00:59:01,757
Well, me and my buddies over there,
we go to every game.

800
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:03,399
Have you seen us?

801
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:05,277
Yeah.

802
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:07,710
I thought I recognized you guys.

803
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:11,714
You guys were the ones getting really drunk
going, "woo, woo," right?

804
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:13,870
- You saw us.
- No.

805
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:16,551
Your school spirit sucks.

806
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:20,030
I'm captain of the cheer squad.
Our school spirit kicks ass.

807
00:59:20,120 --> 00:59:23,954
Yeah, and it's getting hit on
by idiots like you that really sucks.

808
00:59:24,040 --> 00:59:26,349
You're a sassy bitch. I like that.

809
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:29,750
- Get your hands...
- Hang on now.

810
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:33,477
Everybody cool off.
We've had enough fun tonight.

811
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:37,239
Now I've had enough fun.

812
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:41,791
Was that completely necessary? You could
seriously injure a young man by doing that.

813
00:59:50,680 --> 00:59:52,272
I should warn you.

814
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:54,273
I know karate.

815
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:56,431
You better know something.

816
00:59:58,680 --> 01:00:01,717
Any of the rest of you boys here
wanna play the winner?

817
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:13,951
We had the situation under control.

818
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:17,476
Yeah. We were about to go all Buffy
on their gringo asses.

819
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:31,118
I brought you a pillow.

820
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:33,316
It's better than the ones you've been using.

821
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:36,358
Buckwheat hulls. It's good for neck support.

822
01:00:36,840 --> 01:00:38,114
Thank you.

823
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:42,279
That was cool what you did for the girls.

824
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:44,633
It was cool.

825
01:00:46,360 --> 01:00:48,157
That's one big honking bullet.

826
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:50,515
You fixing to send a monkey up
in that thing?

827
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:53,353
That thing
is a personnel suppressor deluxe.

828
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:56,712
Personnel suppressor? You mean killing?

829
01:00:57,200 --> 01:01:00,670
Can't you just wound them or something?
Shoot the gun out of their hand?

830
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:02,432
No, it's impossible.

831
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:08,599
You're not really the cheerleading type,
are you?

832
01:01:08,680 --> 01:01:10,989
For me, it's more penance than a passion.

833
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:14,311
Religious ascetics wear a hair shirt,
I carry the pom-poms.

834
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:16,193
I don't know.

835
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:19,679
I guess it's the duality of man, you know?

836
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:21,956
"That Jungian thing, sir. "

837
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:24,031
Matthew Modine, <i>Full Metal Jacket. </i>

838
01:01:24,120 --> 01:01:27,271
Peace sign on one side of his helmet,
"Born to Kill" on the other.

839
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:28,998
It's my favorite movie.

840
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:33,994
My favorite movie is <i>The Sound of Music. </i>

841
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:42,038
"What's in a name?

842
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:46,439
"That which we call a rose
By any other name would smell as sweet"

843
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:48,598
I don't understand any of this.

844
01:01:48,680 --> 01:01:52,195
Pretty simple, really.
She's a Capulet, he's a Montague.

845
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:56,592
The two families have always hated each
other and they always will hate each other.

846
01:01:56,680 --> 01:01:59,911
- Why couldn't Shakespeare say it like that?
- He could have.

847
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,753
But nobody would be talking about it
410 years later.

848
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:05,035
How do you know so much
about <i>Romeo and Juliet?</i>

849
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:06,109
I read the play.

850
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:09,556
- Why would you read the play?
- Molly's coming over for dinner tonight.

851
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:10,675
Who's Molly?

852
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:12,193
Professor McCarthy.

853
01:02:12,280 --> 01:02:13,633
You call her Molly?

854
01:02:13,720 --> 01:02:16,678
This whole house totally reeks.
What is that smell?

855
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:19,479
Five Alarm Chili. It's my specialty.

856
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,434
You're putting meat into my lentil pot?

857
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:24,358
He's making dinner for Molly.

858
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:25,759
Who's Molly?

859
01:02:25,840 --> 01:02:28,035
Professor McCarthy, Intro to English Lit.

860
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:31,590
I had her last quarter. She's a babe.
And this is what you're serving her?

861
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:32,999
It's his specialty.

862
01:02:33,080 --> 01:02:34,399
My wife loved my chili.

863
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:36,835
Your wife left your gassy old ass.

864
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:39,388
- What's going on?
- Sharp's got a date.

865
01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:46,559
- What are you gonna wear?
- Clothes.

866
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:48,676
- Pants, sport coat.
- Not that butt-ugly thing.

867
01:02:48,760 --> 01:02:49,795
I like that sport coat.

868
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:51,313
I grabbed everything I could find.

869
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:53,755
What comes first,
astringent or exfoliating lotion?

870
01:02:53,840 --> 01:02:54,875
I don't use that stuff.

871
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:56,871
You've got pores
the size of manhole covers.

872
01:02:56,960 --> 01:03:00,919
And the ears, the nose.
We better do something about all this hair.

873
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,070
You can use some bronzer.
You need some color.

874
01:03:03,160 --> 01:03:05,754
- I don't bronze.
- You'll bronze, white boy.

875
01:03:05,840 --> 01:03:09,549
I have been successfully grooming myself
for longer than y'all have been alive.

876
01:03:09,640 --> 01:03:11,676
Some things have changed
since you were young.

877
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:13,990
We've discovered fire and the wheel.

878
01:03:14,080 --> 01:03:16,878
She's right. If you wanna get over,
you better listen to us.

879
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:18,109
I'm just having dinner.

880
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:21,636
Not looking like that you won't.
Barb, can you do anything with the hair?

881
01:03:21,720 --> 01:03:23,039
Shave it all off.

882
01:03:23,120 --> 01:03:24,997
Go talk to her. Give me that.

883
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:32,039
Come on. I mean, it's never gonna work out
between you and Sharp.

884
01:03:32,120 --> 01:03:34,236
He's old enough to be your...

885
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:38,434
great-great-great-great grandfather.

886
01:03:39,040 --> 01:03:42,999
And you have an opportunity to help him.
You went to beauty school.

887
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:44,993
I flunked out.

888
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:46,589
I know.

889
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:48,713
But he doesn't know that.

890
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:05,636
"Natural-looking dramatic highlights...

891
01:04:05,720 --> 01:04:08,598
"that enhance and brighten
your natural hair color. "

892
01:04:08,680 --> 01:04:09,908
- Yes.
- No.

893
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:24,555
Okay, let's focus on the conversation.
How are you gonna get things rolling?

894
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:25,629
I don't know.

895
01:04:25,720 --> 01:04:27,950
It's been a long time
since I went out on a date.

896
01:04:28,040 --> 01:04:31,112
That's okay.
Look, just give us a little preview.

897
01:04:32,320 --> 01:04:33,469
I'm her.

898
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:34,914
I come in.

899
01:04:35,320 --> 01:04:36,309
Go.

900
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:38,675
Well, I'll start out by saying "hello. "

901
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:40,318
No, I'll say "hi. "

902
01:04:41,480 --> 01:04:43,550
No, "hello" is better. I think.

903
01:04:43,640 --> 01:04:45,551
I'll wait and see how I feel at the time.

904
01:04:45,640 --> 01:04:48,108
Then I'll probably start out saying...

905
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:50,751
Asking her if she ever...

906
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:57,396
We'll start talking about...

907
01:05:00,360 --> 01:05:02,271
I'm in deep shit, ain't I?

908
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:08,154
Who knew you were such a babe?

909
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:10,231
Even if you didn't let us frost your tips.

910
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:11,958
You clean up pretty nice, Sergeant.

911
01:05:12,040 --> 01:05:14,554
- You're all that and then some.
- Thank you.

912
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:17,108
Remember, a woman is like a horse.

913
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:20,272
She likes the guy on the saddle
to have a tight grip on the reins.

914
01:05:20,360 --> 01:05:23,591
Excuse me, a woman is not a horse.
Just be yourself.

915
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:26,513
I'm not so sure being himself
is going in the right direction.

916
01:05:26,600 --> 01:05:30,115
Okay. Just be yourself,
but not the you who you really are.

917
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:32,919
Be the you who you would be
if you were somebody else.

918
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,719
- Somebody better.
- That's what I mean. Somebody better.

919
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:37,597
- Maybe we ought to call this off.
- Okay.

920
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:38,669
No!

921
01:05:39,160 --> 01:05:41,879
It's too late.
Okay, just don't be the schizoid Sharp.

922
01:05:41,960 --> 01:05:44,155
Be the Sharp who embraces life.

923
01:05:49,120 --> 01:05:52,271
Now, don't worry.
We'll be with you every step of the way.

924
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:55,995
Sgt. Holt provided us
with a spare set of eyes and ears.

925
01:05:56,840 --> 01:05:58,353
Can you hear me?

926
01:05:58,760 --> 01:06:00,432
Can you hear me now?

927
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:03,511
- Out of here!
- Sorry.

928
01:06:05,240 --> 01:06:07,276
Just take these.

929
01:06:11,720 --> 01:06:12,755
Get!

930
01:06:19,360 --> 01:06:20,509
Hello.

931
01:06:20,840 --> 01:06:21,989
Come in.

932
01:06:33,640 --> 01:06:35,517
Tell her she looks nice.

933
01:06:37,320 --> 01:06:38,753
You look nice.

934
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:41,309
Thank you. So do you.

935
01:06:41,680 --> 01:06:43,079
Nifty jacket.

936
01:06:45,040 --> 01:06:46,553
Give her the flowers.

937
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:48,198
Girls thought you might like those.

938
01:06:48,280 --> 01:06:49,759
No, they were your idea.

939
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:53,549
They're my idea,
but the girls thought you might like those.

940
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:56,512
Well, they were right.

941
01:06:57,480 --> 01:06:59,232
- They're not here, are they?
- No.

942
01:06:59,320 --> 01:07:01,390
Good. That would have been
a little awkward.

943
01:07:01,480 --> 01:07:03,072
<i>Yes. Real awkward. </i>

944
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:05,633
Take the wine.

945
01:07:06,120 --> 01:07:07,269
<i>Take it. </i>

946
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:09,431
I'll just go open this.

947
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:20,678
Where do you keep the corkscrew?

948
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:22,876
Left of the sink, top drawer.

949
01:07:34,360 --> 01:07:35,429
Look.

950
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:38,512
Base to Ranger One, we've got
a makeup check in the dining room.

951
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:41,717
<i>- I repeat, makeup check in the dining room. </i>
- What does that mean?

952
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:44,678
It means she digs you, man.
Now, loosen the hell up.

953
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:55,034
Thank you.

954
01:07:56,080 --> 01:07:57,069
Root beer.

955
01:07:57,160 --> 01:07:59,310
I gave up alcohol about 10 years ago.

956
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:01,630
Didn't like yourself
when you were drinking, huh?

957
01:08:01,720 --> 01:08:05,793
Hell, I loved myself when I drank.
It was other people that had the problem.

958
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:08,429
He's a dork.

959
01:08:13,120 --> 01:08:15,793
Well, why don't I put these in some water.

960
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:21,798
All right, look, you got a laugh.
Now go to the table and light the candles.

961
01:08:21,880 --> 01:08:24,110
No, that's such a lame move.

962
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:25,872
<i>Candles are a total cliché. </i>

963
01:08:25,960 --> 01:08:28,394
<i>What do you know about clichés?</i>
<i>You've got a waterbed. </i>

964
01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:30,550
I say, light the candle. It's sexy.

965
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:34,679
<i>He might as well pull out the bearskin rug</i>
<i>and the disco ball, for God's sake. </i>

966
01:08:34,760 --> 01:08:36,159
I need confirmation.

967
01:08:36,240 --> 01:08:39,312
<i>Is lighting the candle</i>
<i>a cool move or not a cool move?</i>

968
01:08:39,400 --> 01:08:40,435
Fine.

969
01:08:41,280 --> 01:08:42,633
All in favor of candles?

970
01:08:42,720 --> 01:08:44,631
- Me.
- Opposed?

971
01:08:46,240 --> 01:08:49,118
Mission Control to Sharp.
Light those candles.

972
01:08:56,440 --> 01:08:57,839
<i>I don't know. </i>

973
01:08:58,080 --> 01:09:02,596
<i>So many of my colleagues just stick it out</i>
<i>for the paycheque and the benefits. </i>

974
01:09:03,160 --> 01:09:05,355
Or, in my ex-husband's case...

975
01:09:05,440 --> 01:09:08,637
for the endless supply
of fresh, young co-eds.

976
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:12,509
Why would a man want to be with a girl
when he can be with a woman?

977
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:15,872
Or in your case, with five girls.

978
01:09:17,160 --> 01:09:18,832
What is your story?

979
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:21,596
My work became my mistress.

980
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:25,028
Before I knew it, that was all I had.

981
01:09:44,520 --> 01:09:45,953
Willie Nelson.

982
01:09:49,400 --> 01:09:51,231
Man after my own heart.

983
01:09:53,160 --> 01:09:54,752
You want to dance?

984
01:10:07,720 --> 01:10:09,950
So, what's really going on here?

985
01:10:14,080 --> 01:10:15,229
Dancing.

986
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:19,476
No, I mean here.

987
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:23,553
What is a man like you doing in this house?

988
01:10:25,320 --> 01:10:26,753
Well, it's...

989
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:29,911
a temporary assignment.

990
01:10:32,360 --> 01:10:36,512
And I venture to guess it has nothing
to do with cheerleading, does it?

991
01:10:36,680 --> 01:10:38,079
Not much, no.

992
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:41,431
It's kind of complicated.

993
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:48,710
You want to go in the living room?

994
01:10:51,720 --> 01:10:52,789
Yeah.

995
01:10:57,320 --> 01:11:00,198
Gross. What are you gonna do,
bag her on the couch?

996
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:13,440
<i>Good night, Barb. Do your homework. </i>

997
01:11:14,720 --> 01:11:16,438
I can still see you.

998
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:22,552
You're killing me.

999
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:42,515
<i>Hello?</i>

1000
01:11:42,920 --> 01:11:46,276
Hi, I'm returning a call
from somebody named Evie.

1001
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:48,710
<i>That's me. Is this Emma?</i>

1002
01:11:48,920 --> 01:11:51,434
Yeah. I'm sorry, do I know you?

1003
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:53,556
No. But I know your dad.

1004
01:11:53,920 --> 01:11:56,434
I got your number from his cell phone.

1005
01:11:56,600 --> 01:11:59,831
I hope you don't mind,
but I'm doing this psych paper...

1006
01:11:59,920 --> 01:12:02,912
and I was wondering
if I could ask you some questions.

1007
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:05,031
<i>- Yeah, okay. </i>
<i>- Great. </i>

1008
01:12:05,560 --> 01:12:07,278
<i>I have this Hex Rally tomorrow night... </i>

1009
01:12:07,360 --> 01:12:10,397
<i>but I was wondering</i>
<i>if we can get started tonight. </i>

1010
01:12:22,360 --> 01:12:24,271
Five, six, seven, eight.

1011
01:12:37,280 --> 01:12:39,396
- This is...
- Terrible, I know.

1012
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:41,318
I was gonna say good.

1013
01:12:41,680 --> 01:12:43,671
I'm proud of you. It's good.

1014
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:47,269
- What are y'all doing?
- Getting pumped for Hex Rally.

1015
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:49,112
- We'll have to nix the Hex Rally.
- What?

1016
01:12:49,200 --> 01:12:52,192
No. There's no nixing the Hex.
It must go on.

1017
01:12:52,280 --> 01:12:54,271
You can't stop the Hex, Mr. Ranger-man.

1018
01:12:54,360 --> 01:12:56,271
- It's bigger than all of us.
- Is that right?

1019
01:12:56,360 --> 01:13:00,990
If we were doctors, we'd cure cancer.
If we were nurses, we'd give people shots.

1020
01:13:01,280 --> 01:13:05,114
If we were astronauts,
we would do other things.

1021
01:13:05,240 --> 01:13:09,313
But we're not. We're cheerleaders.
And we're going to the Hex Rally.

1022
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:12,149
- You don't respect cheerleading, do you?
- No.

1023
01:13:12,240 --> 01:13:14,231
That's because you still don't get it.

1024
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:16,959
Samuel L. Jackson, Sandra Bullock,
Cameron Diaz...

1025
01:13:17,040 --> 01:13:19,315
Calista Flockhart, Madonna and Halle Berry.

1026
01:13:19,400 --> 01:13:23,393
Not to mention Franklin D. Roosevelt,
Ronald Reagan, George W. Bush...

1027
01:13:23,480 --> 01:13:26,119
and the governor of our fair state,
Rick Perry.

1028
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:27,315
All cheerleaders.

1029
01:13:27,400 --> 01:13:31,359
See, you're a negative person, Sharp.
Cheerleading is all about the positive.

1030
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:35,115
Our job is to inspire, support and electrify.

1031
01:13:35,200 --> 01:13:37,077
Any fool can feel good
when you're winning.

1032
01:13:37,160 --> 01:13:39,754
But when you're down 27 points
in the fourth quarter...

1033
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:43,037
that's when you got to ask yourself,
"Who you gonna call?"

1034
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:48,791
I might call Halle Berry.

1035
01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:33,433
<i>Hey, Longhorns. </i>
<i>Are we ready to take A&M to the mat?</i>

1036
01:14:36,040 --> 01:14:38,554
<i>I don't think these guys can hear you. </i>

1037
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:44,276
<i>All right, well, now that we've put the hex</i>
<i>on those Aggies... </i>

1038
01:14:44,360 --> 01:14:46,555
<i>I want y'all to raise your flames up high... </i>

1039
01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:49,074
<i>for someone who knows</i>
<i>a thing or two about spirit. </i>

1040
01:14:49,160 --> 01:14:53,392
<i>I am talking about</i>
<i>Assistant Cheer Coach Roland Sharp. </i>

1041
01:14:57,320 --> 01:14:58,912
What am I supposed to do with this?

1042
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,275
Inspire and electrify. Go!

1043
01:15:03,680 --> 01:15:04,954
<i>All right. </i>

1044
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:06,314
Bring it.

1045
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:10,593
<i>This torch right here represents... </i>

1046
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:13,269
<i>the spirit burning deep within the heart... </i>

1047
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:16,557
<i>of each and every Longhorn</i>
<i>that never can be extinguished. </i>

1048
01:15:26,080 --> 01:15:27,399
<i>All right. </i>

1049
01:15:28,080 --> 01:15:30,389
<i>All right, you're all here because... </i>

1050
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:33,517
<i>you want to see your Longhorns</i>
<i>emerge victorious. </i>

1051
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:36,837
<i>You want to see them</i>
<i>dominate the football field... </i>

1052
01:15:37,320 --> 01:15:39,993
<i>and win the football game. </i>

1053
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:46,076
<i>Well, then it's up to each</i>
<i>and every one of us to help them. </i>

1054
01:15:46,160 --> 01:15:48,037
<i>We got to raise them up. </i>

1055
01:15:48,280 --> 01:15:50,316
<i>We got to hoist them high... </i>

1056
01:15:50,720 --> 01:15:53,393
<i>to put them on a platform of positivity. </i>

1057
01:15:54,720 --> 01:15:56,790
<i>Any fool can feel good</i>
<i>when you're winning. </i>

1058
01:15:56,880 --> 01:15:59,553
<i>But when you're down 27 points</i>
<i>in the fourth quarter... </i>

1059
01:15:59,640 --> 01:16:02,791
<i>you got to ask yourself,</i>
<i>"Who you gonna call?"</i>

1060
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:06,794
<i>I tell you who I'm going to call,</i>
<i>and that's these ladies right here. </i>

1061
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:09,952
<i>They're the most spirited group</i>
<i>of young ladies I've ever seen... </i>

1062
01:16:10,040 --> 01:16:13,953
<i>or had a chance to get to know and</i>
<i>had the privilege of coming in contact with. </i>

1063
01:16:14,040 --> 01:16:16,634
<i>Praise the Lord and pass the ammunition!</i>

1064
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:37,116
Okay, now can I get a witness?
This man has got the spirit.

1065
01:16:37,200 --> 01:16:40,192
Swear to God, I thought
he was gonna start speaking in tongues.

1066
01:16:40,280 --> 01:16:42,271
What about "platform of positivity"?

1067
01:16:42,360 --> 01:16:45,989
I was gonna do a cartwheel,
but didn't want to steal the limelight.

1068
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:49,592
I think Sharp just made a joke.

1069
01:16:49,680 --> 01:16:52,240
It's more of a jape or a jest,
but still, it's progress.

1070
01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:54,709
- Can we go to the party?
<i>- Negativo,</i> baby.

1071
01:16:55,520 --> 01:16:59,274
Please. When are you guys
gonna get over yourselves?

1072
01:16:59,400 --> 01:17:02,358
Nobody, I repeat, nobody is trying to kill us.

1073
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:10,069
Get out of this van, right now! Let's go.

1074
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:11,354
Come on.

1075
01:17:11,680 --> 01:17:14,114
This thing is not working.

1076
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:16,312
- I'm stuck.
- Let's go!

1077
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:18,391
I'm stuck! I can't get out!

1078
01:17:20,280 --> 01:17:21,474
Get down!

1079
01:17:36,680 --> 01:17:39,433
Okay, maybe somebody is trying to kill us.

1080
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:44,550
How did they, like, find us?

1081
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:46,312
They looked for us.

1082
01:17:47,080 --> 01:17:49,435
- What about Emma?
- She doesn't know where I am.

1083
01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:53,115
Yes, sir, she does.
She called last night on the house phone.

1084
01:17:54,520 --> 01:17:56,476
She was returning my call.

1085
01:17:56,640 --> 01:17:58,312
Was that a mistake?

1086
01:18:01,480 --> 01:18:02,879
Get them upstairs.

1087
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:04,592
Come on, let's go.

1088
01:18:06,040 --> 01:18:07,473
Come on, move.

1089
01:18:13,680 --> 01:18:14,669
Hello?

1090
01:18:14,760 --> 01:18:16,796
- Where you at?
- I'm at home.

1091
01:18:16,880 --> 01:18:17,949
Where's your mother?

1092
01:18:18,040 --> 01:18:21,191
Dad, I told you. She and Keith
went to Cancún for a couple of days.

1093
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:22,713
<i>You don't have to check up on me. </i>

1094
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:25,394
Your friend from the FBI is here.
He told me everything.

1095
01:18:25,480 --> 01:18:27,152
Let me talk to him.

1096
01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:30,391
He wants to talk to you.

1097
01:18:31,440 --> 01:18:33,431
Hey, Sharp. How are your witnesses doing?

1098
01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:34,555
Everyone safe?

1099
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:36,437
You're making a big mistake.

1100
01:18:36,520 --> 01:18:40,399
Good. I was just telling Emma that
a desperate guy is trying to cover a crime...

1101
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:43,631
and if he couldn't get to you,
he might come looking for her.

1102
01:18:43,720 --> 01:18:46,712
Don't worry.
I'm here now, and everything's cool.

1103
01:18:48,360 --> 01:18:50,032
Emma doll, is there any more coffee?

1104
01:18:50,120 --> 01:18:52,156
- Sure, Mr. Zane.
- Thank you.

1105
01:18:57,480 --> 01:18:59,118
<i>I'm a dead man, Sharp. </i>

1106
01:18:59,200 --> 01:19:01,031
<i>I don't care about your witnesses anymore. </i>

1107
01:19:01,120 --> 01:19:04,112
<i>All I want is the money</i>
<i>Ball stole from Cortland. </i>

1108
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:08,270
<i>All right, the night you arrested Ball,</i>
<i>you took a key from him. </i>

1109
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:09,675
Yeah.

1110
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:11,876
Good. Here's what you're gonna do.

1111
01:19:11,960 --> 01:19:15,077
<i>You go to the bank,</i>
<i>take the money out of the safe deposit box... </i>

1112
01:19:15,160 --> 01:19:18,277
<i>put the money in a duffle bag,</i>
<i>get in your truck... </i>

1113
01:19:18,560 --> 01:19:21,916
<i>and meet me in Eagle Pass</i>
<i>near the border at 2:00 p. m.</i>

1114
01:19:22,240 --> 01:19:25,038
<i>Only you, Sharp. No one else. </i>

1115
01:19:55,680 --> 01:19:59,514
Put your keys in the bag
and get out of the truck with the money.

1116
01:20:09,280 --> 01:20:10,872
Bag on the ground.

1117
01:20:12,160 --> 01:20:14,230
Put your weapon in the bag.

1118
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:20,316
Put your cell phone in the bag,
get back in the truck...

1119
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:22,868
and handcuff yourself to the steering wheel.

1120
01:20:22,960 --> 01:20:26,748
Don't try any tricks, Sharp.
I will shoot her right here and now.

1121
01:20:57,720 --> 01:20:59,676
Thanks, Roland. You're a good parent.

1122
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:01,432
<i>Please board immediately. </i>

1123
01:21:03,280 --> 01:21:05,111
<i>This is the last announcement... </i>

1124
01:21:05,200 --> 01:21:09,113
<i>for the bus leaving</i>
<i>for Laredo, Nuevo Laredo... </i>

1125
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:16,313
What the hell?

1126
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:23,314
- What are y'all doing here?
- Barb's got a plan.

1127
01:21:23,400 --> 01:21:24,913
Barb has a plan?

1128
01:21:26,200 --> 01:21:27,519
You know what you're doing?

1129
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:30,114
I spent a year in juvenile detention
for stealing cars.

1130
01:21:30,200 --> 01:21:32,350
It was an educational experience.

1131
01:21:39,320 --> 01:21:41,788
- How'd y'all get here?
- Brand-new car.

1132
01:22:22,280 --> 01:22:24,840
I think I'm having the baby.

1133
01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:29,514
I can't.

1134
01:22:29,920 --> 01:22:32,878
Evie, get it together.
I know you can do it. Just breathe.

1135
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:34,871
Come on. Breathe. Ready?

1136
01:22:40,680 --> 01:22:43,672
Driver, stop the bus!
My friend's having a baby!

1137
01:22:50,560 --> 01:22:51,709
I did it!

1138
01:23:00,160 --> 01:23:04,472
I have to get off <i>el autobús!</i>
I have to have my baby in America!

1139
01:23:05,120 --> 01:23:06,712
I've got the bags.

1140
01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:14,868
Whoa, that's my bag.

1141
01:23:15,360 --> 01:23:17,874
- No, it's mine.
- It's my bag.

1142
01:23:21,920 --> 01:23:24,957
Hi, Emma. We're friends of your dad's,
so just follow me, okay?

1143
01:23:25,040 --> 01:23:26,871
Look, it's my bag, okay?

1144
01:23:27,080 --> 01:23:28,479
Drop the bag.

1145
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:29,993
It's my bag!

1146
01:23:30,720 --> 01:23:32,119
Drop the bag.

1147
01:23:43,200 --> 01:23:44,519
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1148
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:51,349
It's just like dismounting a stretch pyramid.

1149
01:23:51,440 --> 01:23:53,078
Off the bus!

1150
01:23:53,280 --> 01:23:54,554
You ready?

1151
01:23:54,760 --> 01:23:55,988
One, two.

1152
01:23:58,240 --> 01:23:59,719
Move it!

1153
01:24:00,600 --> 01:24:02,716
- Come on, Emma.
- Are you guys serious?

1154
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:03,949
I'm a math major.

1155
01:24:04,040 --> 01:24:05,189
Move it!

1156
01:24:06,080 --> 01:24:08,116
You, too! Off the bus, now!

1157
01:24:13,040 --> 01:24:15,190
- Come on, you can do it!
- Jump!

1158
01:24:44,360 --> 01:24:45,793
You all right?

1159
01:24:53,160 --> 01:24:54,388
I'm fine.

1160
01:26:46,560 --> 01:26:47,879
Halt, <i>señor. </i>

1161
01:27:15,160 --> 01:27:19,312
Eddie, there's doctors, air conditioning
and three meals a day back in town.

1162
01:27:19,400 --> 01:27:21,277
And I need you to testify.

1163
01:27:23,120 --> 01:27:25,509
You're gonna have to kill me, Sharp.

1164
01:27:36,280 --> 01:27:37,269
God!

1165
01:27:38,160 --> 01:27:39,195
Damn.

1166
01:28:12,120 --> 01:28:13,838
Looking sharp, Sharp.

1167
01:28:14,480 --> 01:28:17,517
I don't know.
Maybe we should do another mask.

1168
01:28:17,760 --> 01:28:20,513
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry. I almost forgot.

1169
01:28:24,160 --> 01:28:25,229
Cute.

1170
01:28:25,320 --> 01:28:28,153
Oh, my God! I'm so sorry. Damn it.

1171
01:28:28,840 --> 01:28:31,957
The language! Hello, we're in a church.

1172
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:35,913
Look at you.

1173
01:28:37,440 --> 01:28:40,477
Hey, you guys.
Could you excuse us for a second?

1174
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:42,592
- Sure.
- Yeah, okay.

1175
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:44,319
Don't be nervous.

1176
01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:48,029
And Sharp, remember,
inspire and electrify, okay?

1177
01:28:48,280 --> 01:28:49,759
See you. Great.

1178
01:28:54,720 --> 01:28:56,676
I feel like a freak show in this dress.

1179
01:28:56,760 --> 01:28:59,911
Prettiest freak show I ever saw.
Wait till they see you at Vassar.

1180
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:01,319
Actually...

1181
01:29:01,600 --> 01:29:05,434
I was thinking of turning Vassar down
and becoming a cheerleader.

1182
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:09,432
Dad, that was a joke.

1183
01:29:10,320 --> 01:29:12,834
A joke. That's why I'm laughing so hard.

1184
01:29:19,680 --> 01:29:21,272
I love you, Daddy.

1185
01:29:25,800 --> 01:29:27,597
I love you, too, baby.

1186
01:29:29,320 --> 01:29:30,878
Dearly beloved...

1187
01:29:31,160 --> 01:29:33,799
we are gathered here for this most...

1188
01:29:34,200 --> 01:29:38,557
splendiferous and loquacious occasion...

1189
01:29:40,120 --> 01:29:42,998
to join this couple in holy matrimony.

1190
01:29:43,680 --> 01:29:45,591
Now, Roland...

1191
01:29:46,440 --> 01:29:49,989
do you promise to love this woman, and...

1192
01:29:50,760 --> 01:29:53,672
before you answer, remember that...

1193
01:30:10,880 --> 01:30:12,029
Percy!

1194
01:30:13,760 --> 01:30:15,034
Get on with it.

1195
01:30:15,280 --> 01:30:16,952
Sure, but of course.

1196
01:30:17,840 --> 01:30:19,512
- Well, do you?
- I do.

1197
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:21,592
And, Molly...

1198
01:30:22,480 --> 01:30:24,914
radiant, beautiful Molly.

1199
01:30:25,840 --> 01:30:28,718
Molly. Good Golly, Miss Molly.

1200
01:30:33,120 --> 01:30:36,430
Do you promise to love Roland...

1201
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:39,829
when he is odiferous...

1202
01:30:40,480 --> 01:30:42,710
indifferent, belligerent?

1203
01:30:42,960 --> 01:30:43,995
I do.

1204
01:30:44,960 --> 01:30:46,552
- You do?
- I do.

1205
01:30:48,160 --> 01:30:49,229
Well.

1206
01:30:49,760 --> 01:30:53,116
By the power vested in me
in the state of Texas...

1207
01:30:53,400 --> 01:30:55,675
I now pronounce you man and wife.

1208
01:30:55,760 --> 01:30:57,591
You may kiss your bride.

1209
01:31:13,560 --> 01:31:16,438
Come on, y'all, let's get this party started.

1210
01:31:57,760 --> 01:31:59,398
Who put this table here?
