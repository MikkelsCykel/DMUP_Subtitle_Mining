1
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,037
This place gives me the juice bumps.

2
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,669
- Maybe we should go back.
- Very back.

3
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:44,955
We can't go back now.
Okey-dokey Jones never goes back!

4
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,390
Hang on to your diapies,
we're going in!

5
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:59,038
That’s Tommy Pickles.
He’s the bravest baby l ever knowed.

6
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:04,030
And that’s Phil and Lil.
They like worms.

7
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:10,395
And I’m Chuckie.
I’m not so brave.

8
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:16,709
That’s Okay, 'cause I’ve got Tommy,
and he’s my bestest friend.

9
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,111
Watch out!

10
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:45,119
- Keep going!
- It's right behind us!

11
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:57,874
Tommy!
Tommy ...

12
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,713
Come on, Chuckie!

13
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:10,033
Tommy, you kids
shouldn't be playing in here.

14
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:14,790
We thought the fun times
would last forever.

15
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,510
But we was wrong.

16
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:25,915
- oh, my ...
- Upsy-daisy, Didi.

17
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:30,193
Thank you for inviting me
to your baby shower, Mrs. Pickles.

18
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,791
- Glad you could be here, Suzy.
- What a pretty dress, Angelica.

19
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,472
My mummy's assistant bought it
especially for Aunt Didi's party.

20
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:44,070
Don't say a word.

21
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:48,114
$20 on 8 pounds, 6 ounces.
Who's got 8-7?

22
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:54,236
- 12 pounds, are you crazy?
- You can't see she's gained weight.

23
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:58,399
I mean, from behind.

24
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:02,957
Look what we got for you.
Boris, move your tuchis!

25
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,118
A goat?
Mum, you shouldn't have.

26
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:09,198
Nothing better for her
than goat's milk.

27
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:16,875
Except maybe yak. But you try
finding good yak these days.

28
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:21,312
Here you go, Kinderlach,
some chocolate coins.

29
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:29,790
- Aren't you gonna eat it, Tommy?
- I’m saving it for my baby sister.

30
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,833
- She finally came?
- Not yet.

31
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,158
But they're giving her this party,
so I’m pretty sure today's the day.

32
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,353
Do you think she got losted
on the way to the party?

33
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,199
Maybe we should look for her.

34
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,359
- Come on.
- But she could be anywhere.

35
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,678
- Watch it, pups.
- Careful.

36
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,953
- How's our little man?
- Dr. Lipschitz says it's a girl.

37
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:01,233
That windbag thought
Phil and Lil were intestinal gas.

38
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,479
- ''Riding high, it's a guy.''
- You know what they say:

39
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,513
''Born under Venus, look for a ...''

40
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,999
Dr. Lipschitz is the expert.
None of you have a Ph.D. in Latin.

41
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:18,273
Pig Latin, maybe. Let's just hope
for Tommy's sake it's a girl.

42
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:22,598
How my pups would squabble
if they were both boys!

43
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,395
Let's not do any
gender stereotyping. After all, -

44
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,114
- Stu and drew are brothers,
and they get along fine.

45
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:34,074
- Pushy! Bossy!
- Lazy! Inconsiderate!

46
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:38,717
- Why can't you listen to me?
- We're talking about a real job.

47
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:44,392
I’m not gonna waste my life as a
clock-punching, paper-pushing ...

48
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,397
No offence.

49
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:51,993
You got no insurance, no savings
and another kid on the way.

50
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,875
For your information, bro,
I am working on something now -

51
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:00,198
- that will put this branch of the
Pickles family on easy street.

52
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:05,269
- What now, an electric sponge?
- of course not. That was last year.

53
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:08,438
This is the Reptar wagon!

54
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:13,156
The ultimate in toddler
transportation. The perfect toy!

55
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:19,913
In my day, we had plenty of fun
just throwing rocks at each other.

56
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:23,556
The Reptar Corp is holding
a toy-design contest.

57
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:27,309
The winner gets $500.

58
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,991
There'll be plenty more if this toy
is a hit. And I’ll be famous!

59
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:35,988
That's what you said
when you built that stupid thing.

60
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:41,797
Maybe Ducktar was a little complex.
But this ... watch!

61
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,833
I am Reptar. Hear me roar.

62
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:49,238
I am Reptar. Hear me roar.

63
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:57,354
Can't a man work in his own basement
without getting barbecued?

64
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:03,669
Okay, so maybe real fire isn't
the best idea for a children's toy.

65
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:12,630
Tommy,
somebody's been colouring your room.

66
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,513
Yup, it's for my new sister.

67
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:19,918
- How are we gonna find her?
- We don't know what she looks like.

68
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:24,875
Well, she's a girl like me,
so we know she'll be prettyful.

69
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:29,949
You babies got a lot to learn
about the facts of life.

70
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:35,917
I must get back to the dessert table
before the grown-ups eat it all.

71
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:39,351
Angelica, can you help us
find my baby sister?

72
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,632
I wouldn't be in such a hurry.

73
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:48,756
When she gets here, she'll get all
the toys and love and attention.

74
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,475
Your mummy and daddy
will forget all about you.

75
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:57,196
''Look, Didi, there's that little
bald kid in the house again.''

76
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:02,713
- My mum and dad won't forget me.
- That's what Spike said.

77
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:06,674
- Back when his name was Paul.
- Paul?

78
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:11,670
Then you came. They put him out in
the rain and he turned into a dog.

79
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:16,271
That's not gonna happen to me.
My mum and dad will always love me.

80
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:22,316
A baby is really neat
a baby is a Special treat...

81
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:26,035
Who does Suzy Carmichael
think she is?

82
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:35,835
A baby is a little dickens
a baby is a cuddly chicken

83
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:42,275
- A baby is lots of joy
- A baby will get all the toys!

84
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:47,076
- A baby has a smiley face
- A baby is from Southside Space

85
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:54,072
- A baby is extra fancy
- A baby poops in his pantsies

86
00:08:55,280 --> 00:09:00,229
like a birdie Singing in a tree

87
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:05,070
More like Reptar
screaming in your ear

88
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:10,070
A baby is a gift
a gift from a Bob

89
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:15,070
A baby is a gift
from a Bob, Bob, Bob

90
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:19,068
A baby is a gift...

91
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:23,068
Do you really think
babies are a gift from a Bob?

92
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:27,956
lf Bob bringed a gift,
it's probably one of them.

93
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:33,712
- A baby is very special
- A baby is not!

94
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:39,518
- Betty, it's time.
- It’s time? oh, boy.

95
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:44,396
Everybody to your stations.
Charlotte, call the hospital.

96
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,160
Didi, start your breathing.
Good girl.

97
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:54,395
Up we go, sprout.
We got a Pickle to deliver.

98
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:02,676
Now that’s what l call
a baby shower.

99
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:09,594
Welcome to the Werner P. Lipschitz
Centre for holistic birthing.

100
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:14,430
offering the state of the art
in primitive birth alternatives.

101
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:23,432
Mrs. Pickles!
You weren't due till next week.

102
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:27,713
Well, we can try to squeeze you in.

103
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:32,789
But Dr. Lipschitz promised us the
Zen experience in the Tibetan Room.

104
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,676
In my day, a woman dropped her baby
in the potato field and kept going.

105
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:42,192
Ah, yes, the old Country Room.

106
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:47,076
- Do you have anything cleaner?
- Maybe the Aquatic Immersion Room.

107
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:53,238
She's having a baby,
not a gefilte fish!

108
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:58,514
Stu, Didi, Randy called
to say you were on your way.

109
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,439
l didn't realise
you were bringing the whole party!

110
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:07,192
- How far apart are the pains?
- They're pretty much constant.

111
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:13,111
- Didi, let's get you settled in.
- Here you go, sprout.

112
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:18,713
Don't worry, sweetie.
Mummy's going to be okay.

113
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:25,794
Gosh, Tommy,
your mummy sure seems upset.

114
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,675
Maybe your baby sister
really is losted.

115
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:36,035
- Maybe we can buy a new one.
- Where would we find a baby here?

116
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,516
- Got any queens?
- Go fish.

117
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:59,478
- Hey, a baby store!
- Nice and wiggly.

118
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:03,992
Help me pick one my mum will like.

119
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,749
- Where am l?
- Today’s different than yesterday

120
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:19,397
- So this is the world?
- l miss my old womb

121
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,639
- This world is something strange
- l need a change

122
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:27,594
- This world is something new to me
- oh, my head!

123
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:31,634
- What is this? l can't take it
- me, either

124
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:37,592
- I’m hungry
- l love the extra leg room

125
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:42,351
- Man, they cut my cord
- Consider yourself lucky

126
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:46,348
- This world is way too big
- And populated y s by fuzzy pigs

127
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,519
- This world is something new to me
- This world is such a gas

128
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,918
- Where’s your class?
- This world is something new to me

129
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,557
- Can't a guy get some shut-eye?
- It’s so noisy in here

130
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,593
l can barely hear myself suck!

131
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:07,078
- The food here tastes pretty good
- My compliments to the chef

132
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:10,795
- You've got to holler to get fed
- But l could get used to that

133
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,275
- This world is way too bright
- Turn down the light

134
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:21,234
- So that’s what it looks like
- All things here are meant for play

135
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:26,673
- it’s gonna be a real cool day
- this world is something new to me

136
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:32,198
Real cool ...

137
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:35,836
this world is something new to me.

138
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,117
There you are.

139
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,915
Oh Gevalt! You kinder
gave my ticker such a scare!

140
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,678
All right, Didi, you can do it.
Push now.

141
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:59,668
Have we got a good reading
on the EFM?

142
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,157
oh, Didi, she's so beautiful.

143
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:21,079
She's a boy.

144
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:27,116
Hello, my wonderful, sweet baby boy.

145
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,678
l guess we won't be naming him
after my mother.

146
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:41,432
- what about my cousin Dillon?
- Dillon Prescott Pickles ...

147
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,835
Dill Pickles.

148
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:47,237
Yeah, l like it!

149
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:53,235
Here you go, sprout.

150
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,870
Tommy, l want you to meet
someone very special.

151
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:05,200
This is your brother Dillon.
Dill, this is Tommy.

152
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:10,073
Baby ...

153
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:13,511
See? They already love each other.

154
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:27,438
well, that's a start.

155
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,913
what are we gonna do?

156
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,829
He hasn't stopped crying
since we brought him home.

157
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:49,636
Somehow it's not
as much fun here anymore.

158
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:53,276
- what's your brother so sad about?
- l don't know.

159
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:56,995
But whatever it is,
it must be really bad.

160
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,873
- maybe he's broked.
- what?

161
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:04,312
- Broked!
- Broked?

162
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:09,878
He's not broked,
he's ... just a little loud.

163
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:13,914
That baby's getting on my nerves!

164
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,151
Direct from Moscow,
the Banana Bros Monkey Circus!

165
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,955
Featuring the Most amazing Monkey
Since Brezhnev.

166
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:29,076
so Trotsky on down
to the Banana Bros Monkey Circus!

167
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:32,829
Grandpa, can we go to the circus?

168
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:38,198
It's enough of a circus
around here already!

169
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:48,311
Sergei, you watch the monkeys.
I’ll get us coffee.

170
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:51,876
No, Igor, you watch the monkeys.
I’ll get us coffee.

171
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,594
No! The monkeys watch you.
I’ll get coffee.

172
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:03,436
- Coffee's better in St Petersburg.
- No, it's better in Kei.

173
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:07,872
- It’s better in St Petersburg.
- Nothing's better in St Petersburg.

174
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,992
Look! The train!

175
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:18,828
Stop!

176
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,919
Then the wizard looked down
at the little boy and said:

177
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:11,875
'Your wish has been granted.''
And the little boy ...

178
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:18,076
- Please, help!
- I’ll be back, sweetie.

179
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,714
All l did was cough.
l tried not to.

180
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:28,793
But l coughed and now he's crying.
And now he's got the hiccups.

181
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,073
oh, Stu!

182
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:40,913
- Sing Dill a lullaby.
- I’m too tired to sing.

183
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:45,352
All right, I’ll make something up.

184
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:50,714
Baby, please, rest your head

185
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:55,277
now it is time for bed

186
00:18:55,480 --> 00:19:00,156
- you're cuter than ...
- Uncle Ned

187
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:04,797
- Our little ...
- quadruped.

188
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,594
oh, Stu!

189
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:10,917
It didn't work. He's still awake.

190
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,317
I’ve got one.

191
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:19,833
Twinkle, twinkle
how time flies

192
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:24,670
Slowly in the Starry Skies

193
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:30,000
baby, please, close your eyes

194
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:34,751
- you're as Sweet as ...
- apple pies

195
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:39,715
as you grow and love and play

196
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:44,152
in Our hearts you'll always Stay

197
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:51,471
so Sleep and dream the night away

198
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,916
That was good.

199
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:02,398
baby, please, rest your head

200
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:09,119
now it is time for bed

201
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:14,519
please Stop, don’t you see?

202
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:20,397
l want Mum and Dad for me.

203
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:53,950
Hey sprouts,
a crate's no place for you to play.

204
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:59,917
you might get shipped to Japan.
I’d better keep an eye on this.

205
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:04,398
Dill, that's Tommy's blanket.

206
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:07,273
yeah, it used to sleep with me
before we even got you.

207
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,508
- my blanket!
- He's not very nice.

208
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,269
That's not how
you get things from a brother.

209
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,313
Here, watch.

210
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:23,035
- That's my Reptar, Lillian.
- It is not, Philip.

211
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:27,756
- It is tool
- It is not.

212
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:31,589
see, Tommy?
Now you try it.

213
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:45,677
- mine!
- mine!

214
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:50,790
Gosh, Dill learns fast.

215
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:58,319
Hurry, Pop. They'll be here
to pick it up any minute.

216
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:02,877
why can't l watch Shirleylock Holmes
at our house?

217
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:07,119
I’ll never be able to hear it
with that new baby squawking.

218
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:13,236
dad's got to work overtime, so mummy
won't be so ashamed of his earnings.

219
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,557
Hi, Uncle Stu, sorry to hear
your pony is so slow.

220
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,591
what pony?

221
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:23,794
you told mummy
Aunt Didi got saddled with a loser.

222
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,355
- l ...
- Excuse me.

223
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:29,074
my tax deductions are crying.

224
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:33,398
you can't deduct them
if you don't have any income!

225
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,550
Boys, what are you doing?

226
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:55,471
Dill, what say we give Tommy
a little turn with the bear?

227
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:01,752
or not.

228
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:06,510
Hey, champ,
come with me a minute.

229
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:11,714
I've got something to show you
that's better than a teddy bear.

230
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,436
we weren't going to give you this
till you were older, -

231
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,632
- but l think now is the right time.

232
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:27,472
Grandpa put your picture inside.
l know it's hard, Tommy.

233
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:30,478
you have a little brother now,
and that's a big change.

234
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:36,869
They can be pretty tough
to get along with.

235
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:40,390
They aren't always
what you hoped they'd be.

236
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:45,958
That's why big brothers
have to have faith. y you’ll see.

237
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:49,596
He'll change.

238
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:55,033
After all, you’ve got
responsibility now.

239
00:23:55,240 --> 00:24:01,588
l know you'll stick by Dill's side
and be a swell big brother.

240
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:05,835
Sponsativity...

241
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:15,669
- what is that?
- A Reptar.

242
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:20,670
- Unreal. what you think it's for?
- l don't know.

243
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:25,317
- we could ride to the baby store.
- Great idea.

244
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:32,232
we could take Dill to the hopsicle,
and get Tommy's money back.

245
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:38,151
- Tommy won't be happy about this.
- well, he's sure not happy now.

246
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:44,356
once Dill goes back to the
baby store Tommy will be happy.

247
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:48,075
l don't know about this.

248
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:54,719
- what are you doing?
- Lillian was ...

249
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:59,630
we're taking Dill back to the
hopsicle to get your money back.

250
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:03,310
you can't.
my parents want to keep him.

251
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:08,116
- why? All he does is cry and poop.
- So do you.

252
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:11,153
- l don't cry that much.
- you poop a lot.

253
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:15,638
- Look who's talking.
- l am not a poopy monster.

254
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:19,469
y Shirleylock Holmes, girl detective.

255
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:22,114
we thought you'd be happy, Tommy.

256
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:28,190
Knock it off! Cynthia and me
are trying to watch TV.

257
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:35,756
Hands off the merchandise.

258
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:41,476
Pretty good.

259
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,870
Be nice, Angela, he didn't mean it.

260
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:50,756
you want to ride in a wagon?
I’ll give you a ride.

261
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:54,350
To outside space.

262
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:01,234
my show! Next commercial,
you babies are in big trouble.

263
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:04,716
All aboard!

264
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:10,233
Just walk away, Chuckie.
walk away.

265
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:13,193
wait for me!

266
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:22,509
- which way to the hopsicle?
- we're not going to the hopsicle.

267
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,439
well, we're going somewhere.

268
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,073
Pick up for Pickles, to Japan.

269
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:43,989
Take it away!

270
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,398
yeah, have a good day.

271
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:01,914
Pipe down, Spike.

272
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:06,432
me and Cynthia are watching ...
Cynthia?

273
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:12,829
Nice try babies,
now give me back my ...

274
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:18,594
Cynthia!

275
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:46,118
They took Cynthia. Come on,
you're going to be my butthound.

276
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:50,518
we’ve got to search every doghouse,
tree house and doll's house.

277
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,918
l want those fugitives
back in custody.

278
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:01,709
Bad dog! Stop!

279
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:07,040
Just go to the spa and relax.
Pop and l are taking care of ...

280
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:11,233
Pop, where's the crate?

281
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,113
The delivery folks must’ve come.

282
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:18,279
They loaded her up and everything.

283
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:22,951
Sure you can talk to Tommy.
Pop, where are the kids?

284
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:28,678
They were here a minute ago,
playing in the ...

285
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:32,953
The crate!
Honey ...

286
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:36,516
I’m going to have to call you back.

287
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:50,192
How could you fall asleep? you were
supposed to be watching the kids.

288
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:58,156
we'll never find the babies
with this jerk in front of us.

289
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:14,037
This is more fun
than picking noses.

290
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:19,189
l don't know if l should
throw up or throw down.

291
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:37,991
I’ve turned this plane upside down,
but there are no children.

292
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:42,751
we found a kid, but he's
not the one you're looking for.

293
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:53,271
- Tommy.
- Sprout.

294
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:57,234
- Dill.
- Angelica.

295
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:02,389
- we’ve got to find them.
- Find what?

296
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:06,559
- Einstein here lost the kids.
- l lost the kids?

297
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:09,069
see?

298
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:23,990
- where are we?
- l don't know.

299
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:27,954
- It looks like the park.
- only bigger.

300
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:35,475
This place is bigger than the park
and the backyard all put together.

301
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:40,515
This is bad, you guys.
This is bad.

302
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:43,712
Tommy,
l think your brother's broked again.

303
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:50,314
- Are you okay?
- l think he's gonna explode.

304
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:54,274
- Poopie.
- what?

305
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:58,439
Poopie.

306
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:03,839
- l guess we'll have to change him.
- what do you mean ''we''?

307
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:15,957
you left him with your father?
The man slept through Pearl Harbor.

308
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,116
l sounded the alarm.

309
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:24,111
did your son have any enemies?
Any mob connections?

310
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,629
He is a baby!

311
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:35,912
- The powder goes on his bottom.
- I’m doing the best l can.

312
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:40,557
- Pee-pee.
- Look out.

313
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:47,989
Frog!

314
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:58,319
y our brother made a frog jump on me.

315
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:01,318
you stop it.

316
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:05,672
Let's stop playing around
and figure out how to get home.

317
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:08,633
we don't know where we are.

318
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:15,109
- l know! I’ve got my sponsativity!
- what's a sponsativity?

319
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:18,153
you get it for being a big brother.

320
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:22,194
It's just like when okey-dokey Jones
had to find his way home.

321
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:28,589
- l thought that was a crumpus.
- my dad says it's a sponsativity.

322
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:33,920
where does it say to go?

323
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:37,556
This way ...

324
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:42,554
That's the way,
straight up that hill!

325
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:46,594
Bad dog! Stop!

326
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:21,951
you know, not all dogs go to heaven.

327
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:28,476
There he is!

328
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:33,390
Mr. Pickles, is it true you shipped
your own children to Tokyo?

329
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:36,194
did a dingo eat your baby?

330
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:40,439
How many pecks of pickled peppers
did you pick?

331
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:50,312
Childhood: a time of innocence.
a time of joy.

332
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:54,991
a time of unspeakable,
unrelenting tragedy.

333
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:59,637
Tell us how it feels to know you
May never see your children again.

334
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:03,674
- Can't you show some compassion?
- So sorry.

335
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:09,830
Please, tell us how it feels to know
you may not see your children again.

336
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:13,953
Let me at him.

337
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:20,515
That crowd would indicate
a yard sale or a family tragedy.

338
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,790
I’ll get back to you.

339
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:28,393
How does it feel knowing your
brother lost your only daughter?

340
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:32,070
Share your pain.

341
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:36,596
- y you’re breaking my arm.
- Because l can't reach your neck.

342
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:41,476
There you have it. Two sour Pickles.

343
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:45,150
young Tammy, baby Dale,
the twins, Bill and Jill, -

344
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:51,037
- little Chunky and poor Amelia,
all vanished without trace.

345
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:57,554
I’m Rex Pester and I’ll be back
with More big-action news.

346
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:02,515
Mr. Swenson saw Angelica and Spike
head north on l-99.

347
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:05,439
- my baby!
- Let's go.

348
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:18,475
Private first-class Pickles,
reporting for duty.

349
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:26,509
Good job, you guys.
we're almost there.

350
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:31,714
- Dill, play nice.
- It’s not much fun back there.

351
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:35,959
we're doing okay.
That's some good hitting, Dill.

352
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:42,030
Right about now my dad would
make me a fried baloney sandwich.

353
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:46,756
l can almost smell it.
All crunchy ...

354
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:50,157
Stop it, you're making me hungry.

355
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:58,670
- oh, no!
- we can't see your houses.

356
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:06,798
we can't see any houses.
we're doomed! doomed, l tell you!

357
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:18,958
Mrs. Pickles,
can you identify this binkie?

358
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,037
This is all Dill's fault.
Right, Chuckie?

359
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:31,031
This never would have happened
if you hadn't put him in the wagon.

360
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:37,031
It’s not our fault
you got a naughty baby brother.

361
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:42,997
He's not naughty.
He's just ... a baby.

362
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:47,159
How can you be mad
just because ...

363
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:51,114
... you're standing there
all naked?

364
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:54,517
I’m sure he's just trying to help.

365
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:58,554
It’s hot,
exploring in the woods all day.

366
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:02,548
A little breeze feels good.
Just what l needed.

367
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,512
Thank you, Dill.

368
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:07,951
Those hiccups
are starting to bug me.

369
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:12,517
Face it, having a baby brother
isn't what you expected.

370
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:17,669
Look, somebody's house.
Tommy was right.

371
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:21,759
my sponsativity does work.

372
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:25,953
who'd have a house
way out here in the forest?

373
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,833
maybe a lizard lives there.

374
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:34,558
you know, a guy with a pointy hat
that grants wishes.

375
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:39,629
we just knock on the door
and say we want to go home.

376
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:44,436
- Everything will be back to Norman.
- Thank Bob.

377
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:49,475
Come on, guys.
we're off to see the lizard.

378
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:55,277
- Are you okay?
- l just tripped in a little hole.

379
00:38:55,480 --> 00:39:01,157
It looks kind of like Spike's feet,
if he was a giant.

380
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:06,992
l saw a wolf make prints like that
in a storybook, then he ate a girl.

381
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:11,034
- The wolf ate a girl?
- They got her out ...

382
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:16,837
l don't think it's a wolf.
lf it was, we'd hear him say ...

383
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:24,435
- That was pretty good.
- l didn't do anything.

384
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,669
wolf!

385
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:35,958
- do you see the wolf?
- what does he look like?

386
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:41,439
- Big teeth and furl And teeth!
- No, Dill.

387
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:45,189
Bad, Dill. No.

388
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:54,359
l am Reptar!

389
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:04,070
Margaret, I’m sure you’ve run afoul
of many a scary pedestrian.

390
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:07,716
But out here
we have what you might call ...

391
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:11,196
... actual danger.

392
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:18,158
Grizzlies that will rip the top off
your car. Bobcats, wolies ...

393
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:22,680
And dragons?

394
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:28,876
- l saw some grown-ups. Stop!
- l don't know how.

395
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:35,910
l hope you figure it out because
l didn't bring my bathing suit.

396
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:54,070
Any further and l would
have needed a fresh diapie.

397
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:02,313
Dill, no!

398
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:14,597
aqua Reptar engage.

399
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:24,672
I’m telling you, l saw a dragon.

400
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:29,590
A big, green, fire-breathing dragon.
I’ve got to call headquarters.

401
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:34,032
while you're at it, ask for
a new assignment. Say, a city park.

402
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:39,997
out here in the country
you have to be a little tougher.

403
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:46,230
- A dragon! I saw it!
- Where?

404
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:52,949
A wrapper from a Cynthia sweet bar.

405
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:57,711
- my angel, she's been here.
- She's tracking the sprouts.

406
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:04,996
It’s the Pickles blood. l myself
remember tracking Sitting Bull ...

407
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:12,276
over here! We found some
wheel tracks heading into the woods.

408
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:17,998
- They must be in my Reptar wagon.
- you and your stupid inventions!

409
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:21,636
my stupid inventions ...
That's it!

410
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:27,358
The pups are in the woods.
you men follow those tracks.

411
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:34,269
- Stu, where are you going?
- Trust me. l have a plan.

412
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:44,720
Swab the poop deck, Mr. Phil.
Hoist the anchor, Number one.

413
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:49,198
- a pirate’s life is the life for me
- Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of Yum

414
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:53,871
- l get Seasick on the Sea
- Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of Yum

415
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:58,392
- hoist the Reptar flag real high
- my Sword is pointed to the Sky

416
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:03,230
you need a patch across your eye

417
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:08,711
from Zanzibar to candy bar
Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of Yum

418
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:13,152
we Search for treasures near and far

419
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:17,638

- we'll Shoot through your Mast

420
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:23,392

421
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:28,310
a pirate’s life is a life for me
Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of Yum

422
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:34,197
adventure on the Open Sea
Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of Yum.

423
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:37,631
Dill!

424
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:42,071
Help me, Tommy!

425
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:51,554
Fish!

426
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,350
man overboard!

427
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:58,393
Hang on, Chuckie.

428
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:02,434
Look at him go.

429
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:16,439
Tommy, why didn't you help me?

430
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:22,317
I’m sorry.
Dill needed me, and he's ...

431
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:26,798
... just a baby.

432
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:36,713
Turn around.

433
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:40,913
Help me, you guys.

434
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:53,509
Dill, no!

435
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:14,758
l knew my Ducktar
would come in handy.

436
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:23,670
Pop, are you okay?

437
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:35,428
do you think we'll still be able
to find the lizard's house?

438
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:43,672
Sure. As long as I’ve got my
sponsativity, we'll never be lost.

439
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:48,829
which way are we supposed to go?

440
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:52,350
That way.

441
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:10,115
Look, footprints. maybe there's
other babies around here.

442
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:15,075
- Those are our footprints.
- we're going around and around.

443
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:19,319
- It was working before.
- l don't think it ever worked.

444
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:22,398
y our sponsativity is broke,
just like your brother.

445
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:27,230
- my brother is not broke.
- He pulled the lever.

446
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:32,230
He tried to send us
into the big Jacuzzi.

447
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:37,468
- Hey, you guys, look!
- what is it, Chuckie?

448
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:44,433
what's a train doing
in the middle of the forest?

449
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:48,792
maybe a giant baby
losted his choo-choo.

450
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:13,877
- what do you want?
- Hungry.

451
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:23,675
l want to go play with the monkeys.

452
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:31,630
Hungry.

453
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:44,198
watch my brother.
I’ve got to get the diapie bag.

454
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:53,829
Leave him alone. He's not a nana.

455
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:57,749
Guys, help.

456
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:03,114
The monkeys are trying
to take Tommy's brother.

457
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:08,155
- So?
- Just help me, okay?

458
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:16,193
- Let go.
- okay.

459
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:22,597
This is just great.

460
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:26,315
It can't get any worser than ...

461
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:31,236
... this.

462
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:37,276
- At least the monkeys are gone.
- And they took baby Dill with them.

463
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:46,313
where are you going, you dumb dog?

464
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:54,229
Hey! My rolleyblade is cracked.

465
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:59,830
Cynthia, are they
taking care of you?

466
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:06,991
will they know to comb your hair,
or put you into your sport jumper?

467
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:11,796
Spike ...
dog breath!

468
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,595
Spike?

469
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:30,191
This time she'll fly.
I’m facing into the wind.

470
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:36,357
- Ready? Go?
- No!

471
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:51,873
- This is bad.
- Here comes Tommy.

472
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:56,710
- Put the blankie on him.
- okay, I’ve got it.

473
00:50:56,920 --> 00:51:01,994
- l think it's going to rain.
- we'd better go.

474
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:08,548
- l must finish feeding my brother.
- He's not hungry.

475
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:12,150
Besides, he's a ...

476
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:15,511
- A monkey?
- Look at that!

477
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:19,713
my brother turned into a monkey?

478
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:24,311
- we’ve got to get out of here.
- Not while my brother's a monkey.

479
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:27,796
we must find the lizard's house.

480
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,436
That's it! The lizard can wish him
back into a people.

481
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:34,757
what if we only get one wish?

482
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:38,509
lf you use it up on Dill,
how are we going to get home?

483
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:41,632
l have to wish him back.

484
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:44,115
- you can't.
- l can.

485
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:48,996
- what if Phil turned into a monkey?
- That's different. l like Philip.

486
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:54,638
you'd be wasting your wish anyway,
because that's not your brother.

487
00:51:54,840 --> 00:52:01,393
- wait a minute ...
- what Lillian means is ...

488
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:06,720
The monkeys took baby Dill. would
you mind a baby monkey instead?

489
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:09,878
- what?
- Nobody like him, Tommy.

490
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:15,757
we're going to find that lizard.
Find your brother by yourself.

491
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:20,192
- will you help me, Chuckie?
- Sorry, Tommy.

492
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:24,359
- But you're my bestest friend.
- yeah ...

493
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:29,873
Then how come, when l got
thrown up on, you didn't help me?

494
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:34,631
when l falled overboard,
you didn't help me.

495
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:40,790
when a monkey dropped me,
you didn't care about my boo-boo.

496
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:46,315
you don't got
a bestest friend no more.

497
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:49,273
All you got is a brother.

498
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:58,035
Fine ...
I’ll go find him by myself.

499
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:24,757
you dumb butthound.
l hope you turn into a frog.

500
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:28,191
I’ll find Cynthia myself.

501
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:33,872
one way or another
I’m gonna find you

502
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:39,552
some way or another
I’m gonna win you

503
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:44,788
Cynthia, oh Cynthia
l need to see you

504
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:50,836
from that kid or his brother
I’m gonna get you

505
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:56,239
I’ll find the full diaper bag

506
00:53:56,440 --> 00:54:01,468
and lf you're ripped or you're hurt

507
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:06,356
I’ll push them in dirt
Yeah!

508
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:24,519
Give me back my brother.

509
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:28,508
Get out of here, you monkey.

510
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:40,159
Let's get out of this rain.

511
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:46,316
you rookies can get excited
and lose your heads.

512
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:50,069
Veterans like me
remain cool and collected.

513
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:56,993
our kids are lost in the storm.
you've got to help us.

514
00:54:57,200 --> 00:55:00,829
There's dragons out there!
I’m a park ranger, -

515
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:05,875
- not a knight of the round table.
Go find somebody with a lance.

516
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:09,914
Never mind him. Come with me.

517
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:19,871
Have a little bottle and take a nap.

518
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:24,517
- Everything will be okay.
- mine!

519
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:29,077
But I’m hungry, too.
Stop that!

520
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:32,989
Dill, that's enough.

521
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:38,634
you didn't leave any for me.

522
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:40,831
All gone.

523
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,468
Dill.

524
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:58,994
Dill!

525
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:01,509
my blanket!

526
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:05,349
- Dill!
- my blanket! My blanket!

527
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:10,190
- l need some blankie, too.
- mine! Mine!

528
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:27,359
It’s not funny! They were right.
y you’re a bad, naughty baby.

529
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:31,314
y you’re never gonna get any better.
I’m through being your big brother!

530

531
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:46,555

532
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:51,072
you want monkeys?
I’ll give you monkeys.

533
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:57,150
y you’ll have a monkey mummy and
a monkey daddy and a monkey brother.

534
00:56:57,360 --> 00:57:00,909
l should have let my friends
take you back to the hopsicle.

535
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:05,318
l said you didn't mean it.
you were only playing.

536
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:10,196
l was wrong.
Now l don't even have friends.

537
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:21,237
He wants monkeys,
and monkeys want bananas ...

538
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:27,072
Everybody gets what they want.

539
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:56,919
I’m sorry, Dill.

540
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:04,837
It’s okay.
Everything’s going to be okay.

541
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:31,959
Phil? Lil?

542
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:38,358
- oh, Phil!
- Chuckie.

543
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:45,079
He always loved climbing trees.
Now a tree's climbed on him.

544
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:48,556
He was my favorites brother.

545
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:51,752
Speak to me, Philip.

546
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:56,636
- Have you guys seen my shoes?
- Philip!

547
00:58:56,840 --> 00:59:03,154

- This time we really are doomed.

548
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:07,592
doomed! doomed!

549
00:59:10,560 --> 00:59:13,472
Snap out of it.

550
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:20,438
lf we find the lizard before Tommy,
how is he going to get home?

551
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:25,475
what are you worried about him for?
He left you to the fish.

552
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:28,797
All he cares about is baby Dill.

553
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:34,120
well somebody has to ... don't they?

554
00:59:55,400 --> 01:00:01,270

Hang on, Angelica.

603
01:06:27,160 --> 01:06:30,516
A truck load of babies and
their pet horse lost in the woods.

604
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:36,158
our hearts go out
to their grief-stricken parents.

Pickles, now look what you’ve done.
