00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:36,880
I busied myself
to think of a story...

2
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,080
which would speak to the mysterious
fears of our nature...

3
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:44,320
and awaken thrilling horror--

4
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:50,600
one to make the reader
dread to look around--

5
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,200
to curdle the blood...

6
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,920
and quicken the beatings
of the heart.

7
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,920
Tell the captain
we've got to take in...

8
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,880
the top sail!

9
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,160
She's going to rip!

10
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,560
Please, Captain !

11
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,920
We have to drop the sails!

12
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,920
All hands to the mast!

13
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,120
Take the wheel! Come on!

14
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:13,240
We're dead!
We've hit the ice!

15
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,680
Iceberg ahead!

16
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,720
Hard to starboard!

17
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,560
Help!

18
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,800
Hold on men !

19
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,720
Put your backs into it, men!

20
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,360
- Let's go!
- Captain, this is useless.

21
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,960
- The ice stretches tor miles.
- Do you suggest we lay down and die?

22
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,640
The men are exhausted.
They can't go on.

23
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,560
I have not come this tar
to give up now.

24
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,640
They knew the risk when they signed on.

25
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,680
And we're gonna chop our way
to the North Pole if we have to.

26
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,880
Then you run the risk
ot mutiny, Captain.

27
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,680
- Did you say "mutiny"?
- Yes, I did, sir.

28
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:55,120
We proceed north as planned.

29
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:01,360
- At the cost ot how many more lives?
- As many as it takes!

30
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,880
There's something out there.

31
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,520
What the hell is that?

32
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,280
Who is your captain?

33
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,800
I am.
Who the devil are you?

34
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:04,800
I have no time to talk. Bring your men
and weapons and follow me.

35
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,120
- Now!
- Stay where you are!

36
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,240
I give the orders here.

37
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,960
Stop the dogs! Get them!

38
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,400
Leave them.

39
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,760
They're already dead.

40
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,880
Get back to the ship now!

41
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,880
Everybody back to the ship!

42
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,240
Bears don't kill like that!
Nothing does!

43
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,800
Maybe it wants that man.

44
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,760
- Or it wants the captain.
- It's the devil come for the captain.

45
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:54,400
For the last time, I made my way trom
St. Petersburg to Archangel on toot.

46
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:57,320
From there I took
a whaling ship north.

47
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,360
When we hit the ice,
I used the dogs.

48
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,360
What's out there?

49
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:16,040
Listen to me.
I have spent six years planning this.

50
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,640
My entire tortune.

51
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:21,000
I will not be stopped by you
or some phantom.

52
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:24,600
Do you share my madness?

53
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,120
No, not madness.

54
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,040
What, then?

55
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:36,160
There's a passage to the North Pole,
and I will find it.

56
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,200
At the cost ot your own lite?
The lives of your crew?

57
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,120
Lives come and go.

58
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:46,320
It we succeed, our names
will live on torever.

59
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:52,080
I will be hailed
as the benetactor ot our species.

60
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,000
You're wrong.

61
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,160
I, of all men, know that.

62
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,000
Who are you?

63
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,600
My name...

64
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:10,560
is Victor Frankenstein.

65
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,600
Oh, my wondertul son, Victor.

66
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,760
You are the handsomest,
kindest, cleverest...

67
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:38,240
most wondertulest boy
in the whole world.

68
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,600
Madam, you will spoil the boy.

69
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:55,760
Would you and your daughter
leave us, please, Mrs. Moritz?

70
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,880
Come along, Justine.

71
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:06,040
Victor, this is Elizabeth.
She's coming to live with us.

72
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:09,720
She's lost both her mother
and tather...

73
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,240
to the scarlet tever, Victor.

74
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,160
She's an orphan now.

75
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,200
You must think of her
as your own sister.

76
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:22,920
You must look atter her,
and be kind to her.

77
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,880
Always.

78
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:43,400
Mother! How is the imminent arrival?

79
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,920
Oh, a little trisky today.

80
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:58,320
When you were a little boy, you
used to chase tiretlies in the tield.

81
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:01,040
Yes, and when I'd trap them
in my jar, they died.

82
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,440
- Do you remember how you cried?
- Yes.

83
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,920
Because you wanted to keep them glowing
by your bedside...

84
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,840
to light you as you read.

85
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,120
You were so hungry for knowledge.

86
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,040
Such a serious little boy.

87
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,360
You've become
such an earnest young man.

88
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:22,800
All these strange and ancient books.

89
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,880
You'll be an even greater doctor
than your tather.

90
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,480
But you know, Victor,
life shouldn't be all study.

91
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,680
There's such tun to be had.

92
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,600
Give me that back, Mother.

93
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,640
Change partners and twirl!

94
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:57,440
Caroline, you mustn't
exert yourselt. Please.

95
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:01,360
Don't worry, madam.
Your new baby will be a natural dancer.

96
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,120
Excellent.

97
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,960
You'll be the envy
ot all the young ladies and gentlemen.

98
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:14,160
Please, Justine,
may I have this dance?

99
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,160
Madam.

100
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,680
Come on. That's it.
You must make a decision.

101
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,880
- The baby's in the wrong position.
- Cut me.

102
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,160
Oh, I can't.

103
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:35,120
Cut me. Save the baby.

104
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,360
She'll be all right.

105
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:48,280
Father's the tinest doctor in Geneva.

106
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,080
Father?

107
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:06,120
Well, how is she?

108
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,520
I did everything I could.

109
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,440
Mother!

110
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,320
Bring her back.

111
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:39,760
Please bring her back.

112
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:20,120
Oh, Mother,
you should never have died.

113
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,800
No one need ever die.

114
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,760
I will stop this.

115
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,320
I promise.

116
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:37,360
Victor, you're completely obsessed.
Please explain what that is.

117
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:40,560
It's energy. It never disappears.
It merely changes torm.

118
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:44,880
It's possible to convert this candle wax
into a mechanical dog's convulsions.

119
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:49,480
The applications ot this
are limitless. Really.

120
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,920
Well, please come outside, Victor.
It's such a beautiful day.

121
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,440
Go away. I'm busy.

122
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,640
What's this?

123
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:04,080
It's tor spraying down
the electric eels.

124
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,560
Now put it down.
It's not tor playing with.

125
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:13,400
Don't do that.

126
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,320
Give me that.

127
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,960
Yes, come on! Atter all,
we should be grateful to Victor...

128
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,240
tor abandoning his experiments
tor one atternoon.

129
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,200
Well, who says I have?

130
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:36,080
- What do you mean?
- Look!

131
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,440
We're all going to die.
You knew this was going to happen.

132
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:43,360
Not for certain. But I had hoped
the conditions would be right.

133
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:47,360
But I've never seen one quite as large
as that. Look, it's wondertul!

134
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,360
- You shouldn't have done this.
- It's all right.

135
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:53,720
- We must take cover. A tree!
- That's exactly the wrong thing to do.

136
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:57,840
- It's a larger conductor than we are.
- What about Willie?

137
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,360
- What are we to do?
- Come on !

138
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:03,200
Spread out!
Elizabeth, take this.

139
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:06,080
- Come on ! Quickly!
- What is that?

140
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,960
- Dig it right into the ground.
- Now what?

141
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,320
Everyone down. Quickly!

142
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,080
Give me your hands.
It'll be fine.

143
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,120
- That's good.
- I hope you know what you're doing.

144
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,560
Willie, don't look up!

145
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,800
Wait.

146
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:28,640
One, two, three!

147
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,600
Now.

148
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,560
So how do you teel, Elizabeth?

149
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,360
Alive.

150
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,400
Ladies and gentlemen,
dear friends...

151
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,080
gather around and listen.

152
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:38,040
As you probably know,
tomorrow my dear son Victor...

153
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,800
Ieaves me to pursue
what I'm sure...

154
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,640
will be an illustrious career
in a protession...

155
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:45,440
that I myselt am not altogether
unassociated with.

156
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,160
Though, my--

157
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,800
My one regret is that his mother--

158
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,640
my late wite--

159
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,720
is not here...

160
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:06,440
to share the fire...

161
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,800
which our son fills me with tonight.

162
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,320
Yes.

163
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,800
She wanted you to have this, Victor,
on your graduation.

164
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,880
And in it she has written...

165
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,080
"This is the journal
ot Victor Frankenstein."

166
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:42,480
The rest ot the leaves are blank...

167
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:47,200
to be filled with the deeds
of a noble life.

168
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:15,640
We'd better go in
betore they miss us.

169
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:18,120
Just a little while longer,
please.

170
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,600
I don't know when
we'll be alone together again.

171
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,120
Oh, dear Victor.

172
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,000
I'll miss you laughing at me.

173
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,840
I'll miss you making me laugh.

174
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,480
So...

175
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,560
how do brothers and sisters
say good-bye?

176
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,200
Perhaps they never have to.

177
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,840
I won't if you won't.

178
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:15,760
Are you my sister?

179
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,480
Sister.

180
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,880
Friend.

181
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,520
Lover.

182
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,080
Wite?

183
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,560
Yes.

184
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,880
Then come with me to lngolstadt.
Marry me now.

185
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:34,160
- No.
- Then I'll stay.

186
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:40,080
I want more than anything else
in the world to be your wife.

187
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:43,320
But as long as you're away,
I belong here.

188
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,600
I want to make this house live again.

189
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:50,800
I want to make this
a great home tor our children.

190
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:56,480
And now you must go,
and do the great things you need to do.

191
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:00,000
I want you so much.

192
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:04,080
I'll be here when you return.

193
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,640
Each holiday.

194
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:09,000
Every visit.

195
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,720
And on our wedding night.

196
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,480
Until our wedding night.

197
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:52,080
A lot ot stairs, I'm atraid.
How was your journey?

198
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:54,760
Very good, thank you.
I made good progress in the mountains.

199
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:59,760
Good. I'm pleased. As I've said,
we've only got attic space.

200
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,400
That's exactly what I'm looking tor.
But Frau Brach...

201
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,600
there will be a great deal
ot scientitic equipment and rigging...

202
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,760
to be delivered every day
tor the next week.

203
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,440
I trust you've no objections.

204
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,640
I'm sure you appreciate the need
tor a proper laboratory.

205
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,560
Oh, Putzi likes you.

206
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,640
This will be pertect.

207
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:32,640
The foolish and vain
force their views by the rod...

208
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,680
but "knowledge is power
only through God. "

209
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:39,760
Our motto. Easily torgotten...

210
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,000
by you young men in a hurry.

211
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:48,560
But perhaps the greatest mistake...

212
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:52,440
that all students make
during their time here...

213
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:56,080
is to suppose
that they can ever have...

214
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:59,280
an original or creative thought.

215
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:04,400
We have all imagined that in our time.

216
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:12,240
But gentlemen,
you have not come here...

217
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,040
in order to think tor yourselves.

218
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:19,440
You are here to learn how to think
tor your patients.

219
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,240
You must learn, therefore,
in the tirst place...

220
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,800
to submit yourselves...

221
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:29,680
to the established laws
ot physical reality.

222
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,080
But surely, Protessor...

223
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:35,920
you don't intend we disregard
more philosophical approaches?

224
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,360
Philosophical?

225
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:41,360
Those which stir the imagination
as well as the intellect.

226
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,760
Paracelsus, tor example.

227
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,000
Ah, Paracelsus.

228
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:47,040
An arrogant and foolish Swiss.

229
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,720
Albertus Magnus.

230
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,400
His nonsense was exploded...

231
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,640
500 years ago.

232
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,440
Cornelius Agrippa.

233
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,480
A sorcerer, an occultist.
What is your name?

234
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:03,680
Victor Frankenstein, sir.
Of Geneva.

235
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,760
Oh, another Swiss.

236
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:09,280
Mr. Frankenstein...

237
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,040
here at the University of lngolstadt
we teach...

238
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:15,480
and indeed hope to advance,
the science ot medicine.

239
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:19,400
Chemistry, biology, physics.
We study hard science.

240
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:23,240
But surely, Protessor, the greatest
advances come in combining these things.

241
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:26,840
We do not study the ravings
of lunatics and alchemists...

242
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,040
hundreds ot years in their graves.

243
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,760
Because their kind...

244
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,680
ot amateur, tanatical,
tantastical speculation...

245
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:37,640
does not heal bodies or save lives.

246
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,960
Only science can do that.

247
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:47,040
Now, have we your permission
to continue?

248
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:54,000
- Nice coat.
- Thank you.

249
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:57,520
Don't take it too hard. Krempe just
doesn't approve ot public humiliation.

250
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:00,520
- I am not mad.
- My dear tellow, ot course you're not.

251
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:03,480
In tact, that's just the sort ot thing
I'd expect a rational person...

252
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:05,760
to say to a complete stranger.

253
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:09,200
Henry Clerval, by the way,
and I'm completely crazy.

254
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:12,080
- Victor Frankenstein.
- Of Geneva.

255
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,760
Why don't you look where I'm going?

256
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,760
That's Schiller,
ornament ot the playing tield.

257
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,520
- Really?
- You can tell he's new.

258
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:25,040
He goes around looking at things
with his mouth open.

259
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,920
What are you here tor?

260
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,120
- Research.
- Very grand.

261
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,240
I'm here to become
a mere doctor.

262
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:36,360
I'm told that has something to do
with healing the sick...

263
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,840
but I find sick people
rather revolting.

264
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,520
Still, I'll have a good time...

265
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,240
get my degree--
it I can stop tailing anatomy--

266
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:47,760
and settle down to relieve rich ladies
of their imaginary ailments...

267
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:50,640
and then relieve their very real
and beautiful daughters.

268
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:53,360
Who was that?
He was at the lecture.

269
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,120
That's Waldman.

270
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,680
Yes. Interesting case.

271
00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:00,560
They say in his youth he could break
into heaven and lecture God on science.

272
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,880
Ran into trouble with the authorities
a tew years back.

273
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,120
Something to do
with illegal experiments.

274
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,400
What kind of experiments, I wonder?

275
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:12,240
What was it you were saying?
Rich old ladies and their daughters?

276
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:16,400
Yes, it's a lite ot sacritice,
I know, but someone's got to do it.

277
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:34,120
That is why the central nervous system
and its crowning achievement...

278
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:37,760
the brain, are as complicated
and mysterious a set of organs...

279
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,760
as you are ever likely to encounter.

280
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:43,280
Mr. Frankenstein,
the incision is yours.

281
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,960
Excellent.

282
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,960
Mr. Clerval, you may remove
the cranial lid.

283
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:02,120
"Henry has now tully recovered and
continues his struggle to pass anatomy."

284
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,920
I was always terrible at anatomy.

285
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,960
"Protessor Waldman is very tolerant
ot him and myselt.

286
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:09,040
I am learning a great deal.
Professor Waldman is remarkable."

287
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:12,200
- And so is Henry.
- "God bless you all. My Love, Victor."

288
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,240
- That's very nice.
- "P.S. I've tallen in love."

289
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:18,400
- I beg your pardon !
- "She's dark, sleek and beautitul...

290
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,120
and always wags her tail
whenever she sees me.

291
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:25,200
Her name is Putzi, and she's the
triendliest sheepdog I've ever known."

292
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:32,240
"P.S. Elizabeth, I dream ot how your
hair shines in the moonlight."

293
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:35,160
Of how your lips taste.
I dream of your arms and your breasts...

294
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,520
and of the time on our wedding night...

295
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:39,760
when we will be alone together
at last.

296
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,480
What else does it say?

297
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:44,720
It says, "I'm working very hard
and making lots ot new triends."

298
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,640
Cottee, anyone?

299
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:51,480
Once and for all, Frankenstein.

300
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:54,520
Lite is life. Death is death.

301
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,960
These things are real.

302
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,760
That is rubbish,
and you know it.

303
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:03,280
That premise has been repeatedly
challenged by your own statt members.

304
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,800
We don't know where lite ends
or death begins.

305
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:09,320
Hair and tingernails continue to grow
after what we choose to call death.

306
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:14,200
We know that a man's brain, heart and
lungs may continue to pump and breathe.

307
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,920
Now, you know that!

308
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,400
Mr. Frankenstein ot Geneva, I warn you,
what you are suggesting...

309
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:22,960
is not only illegal,
it is immoral.

310
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,400
Rubbish!

311
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:29,840
"Dear Diary, Why does no one
understand me?

312
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:33,040
P.S. I am not mad."

313
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:36,320
You ! Explain yourself!

314
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:40,400
Protessor, I'm sorry. Listen. I came
here to learn all about the new science.

315
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,680
Galvanism, Franklin's experiments.
The combination of modern disciplines...

316
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,480
with ancient knowledge
in an attempt to protect and create--

317
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,680
To create what?

318
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:52,080
So we can change things.
We can make things better.

319
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:55,120
You know that. We are on the verge
of undreamt-ot discoveries...

320
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:57,200
it we've the courage
to ask the right questions.

321
00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:00,080
Now, you must help me. Please!

322
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,960
Come on.

323
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,840
Lock the door.

324
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:41,680
Now, tor thousands ot years, the Chinese
have based their medical science...

325
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:46,480
on the belief that the human body is
a chemical engine run by energy streams.

326
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:48,080
But how do they explain--

327
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:50,400
Don't touch that!

328
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:55,280
Their doctors treat patients
by inserting needles like these...

329
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:59,920
into the tlesh at various key points
to manipulate these electric streams.

330
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,400
I see.

331
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,920
So electricity is the key.

332
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:06,360
Now look at this.

333
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:23,160
Go on. Touch it.

334
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,320
- It teels warm.
- Yes.

335
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,360
Yes. How do you do?

336
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,800
- Turn it otf!
- I can't. It's not working.

337
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:42,480
Try to stay calm. It's simply
a matter of reducing the polarity.

338
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:45,360
- A monkey's arm is like a human's.
- No arm is this strong!

339
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,680
Now, this must work.

340
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:56,480
Let me help you, Professor.

341
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,520
You shall, ot course, tell no one.

342
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,880
They wouldn't believe you anyway.

343
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:15,080
"Dearest Victor,
Nothing much changes here.

344
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:20,160
Mrs. Moritz continues to love
and torment Justine in equal measure.

345
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,400
Willie grows more precocious
every day...

346
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:26,640
and Father almost expires with pride at
the very thought ot you and your work.

347
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:31,040
And l-- Well, I just miss you.

348
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,080
Very much.

349
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:35,160
Please write soon, Victor."

350
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,320
No, I'm serious.
You take vaccine, for instance.

351
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:41,320
Thirty years ago, the entire concept
ot vaccine was unheard of...

352
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,760
and now we save lives every day.

353
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:46,080
- But that isn't the whole answer.
- What do you mean?

354
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:49,360
Eventually, the best way to cheat death
will be to create lite.

355
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,520
Now you've gone too tar.

356
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,360
There's only one God, Victor.

357
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:57,080
Leave God out of this. Listen.
Say someone you love has a sick heart.

358
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,200
- Would you give them a healthy one?
- Impossible.

359
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,720
We can do it.

360
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:04,560
If we can replace one part ot a human
being, we can replace every part.

361
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,920
And it we can do that,
we can design a lite.

362
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,920
We can create a being
that will not grow old or sicken.

363
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,320
One that will be stronger than us,
better than us.

364
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,880
One that will be more intelligent,
more civilized than us.

365
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,240
- In our lifetime?
- No.

366
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,400
How close did you get, Protessor?

367
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,960
Too close.

368
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,920
Protessor, I beg you,
let me see these notes.

369
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:35,400
My work now and its application
lies exclusively...

370
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,840
in the preservation ot life.

371
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:40,960
I abandoned my other researches
many years ago.

372
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,880
Why?

373
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:46,840
Because they resulted in abomination.

374
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,280
You're not sticking that in me.
It's got a pox in it, I hear.

375
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:12,000
- Pox? They're giving us pox?
- That's right.

376
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:15,120
It's a vaccine that will prevent
a plague in this city.

377
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,840
Just tiny harmless amounts
ot anti-smallpox serum.

378
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:20,840
- You just said pox!
- I said it was harmless.

379
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:24,320
It's a necessary precaution
without which this godforsaken city...

380
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,400
would be immediately
put under quarantine.

381
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:30,160
I don't care what you doctors tell me.
You're not sticking that in me!

382
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:33,680
Yes, I am! It's the law!
Now, sit him down, someone.

383
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:36,880
- Come on.
- You're not sticking that in me!

384
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,160
- Sir?
- Protessor?

385
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,560
Get him!

386
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,480
Come on !

387
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,880
It's no use, Victor.
He's gone.

388
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,800
Let him go.

389
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,720
This shouldn't happen.

390
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:04,480
It need not happen!

391
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,200
To hell with you!

392
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:17,560
Whatever you say,
whatever you call it...

393
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,840
you doctors are killers!

394
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,160
You murder people!

395
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:25,160
Evil! You're evil!

396
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,640
You're the ones deserve to die!

397
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:32,520
God will punish you !

398
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,880
My God, you were so close.

399
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:56,240
Ot course, the power!
The materials were wrong.

400
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:59,440
You needed auxiliary sources.

401
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:02,000
Yes, the experiment.

402
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:05,040
A tailure? "Resulting reanimant...

403
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,200
maltormed and hideous to behold.

404
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:13,080
This tactor dependent
on the appropriate raw materials."

405
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:19,880
Raw materials.

406
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:40,400
- Come on, Henry.
- I can't help you.

407
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:42,880
- What are you trightened ot?
- Everything.

408
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,800
- What it the authorities--
- We'll do this in secret.

409
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:48,640
I've got the raw materials.
I've got Waldman's journals.

410
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,720
- You stole Waldman's journals?
- We owe it to him to complete his work.

411
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:54,160
- He was one step away.
- He never wanted this.

412
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:58,040
- He couldn't tace it.
- Even it it were possible...

413
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:02,040
and even it you had the right, which
you don't, to make this decision...

414
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:05,120
can you imagine for one second there
wouldn't be a terrible price to pay?

415
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,920
I think tor the chance
to defeat death and disease--

416
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,640
to let everyone on this earth
have the chance ot lite--

417
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:12,560
sustained, healthy lite--

418
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:17,120
to allow people to love each other,
to be together torever--

419
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:21,320
tor all ot that,
I think it's a risk worth taking.

420
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,640
Please, Justine, just leave me alone.
I won't talk about it.

421
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:46,640
All these letters.
You read them to us every week.

422
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:50,440
I wrote the letters!
He hasn't written to me in months.

423
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:55,400
Something horrific is happening to him.
I can teel it.

424
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:58,680
At tirst I wasn't sure, but I knew
I had to hide it trom Father.

425
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,880
Now there are rumors ot cholera.

426
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,920
I can look after Father and Willie.
You go to lngolstadt.

427
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,280
That's not possible. He won't want me.
He's probably found someone else!

428
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:10,680
It he was mine,
I would have gone already!

429
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:14,000
But he isn't mine.
He's yours.

430
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,560
And you must go to him.

431
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,960
Raw materials,
that's all they are.

432
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:37,080
Tissue to be reused.

433
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,360
The very tinest brain.

434
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,800
- But they all died ot cholera, sir.
- No matter.

435
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,600
Thank you.

436
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:15,440
Now, the assembled organs must have
the appropriate nutrients and heat.

437
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:20,240
And crucially, more direct power.

438
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,520
More direct power.

439
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:49,440
Amniotic tluid is the chiet
biogenic element.

440
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,480
The subject is injected with this.

441
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:54,800
The acupuncture needles pierce the tlesh
at all key energy points.

442
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:58,640
After the removal of current,
a dead toad should retain animation...

443
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:02,720
but independently
of external power sources.

444
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,840
Yes!

445
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:15,480
That's it!

446
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:18,400
That's the combination!

447
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,000
That's it!

448
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:25,680
Open the door!

449
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,280
- Victor, please!
- What do you want?

450
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:31,400
It's cholera.
It's an epidemic.

451
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,840
The city's been placed
under martial law.

452
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:37,520
- Are you listening to me?
- Yes. And?

453
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:39,920
The militia's arriving
to quarantine the city.

454
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:42,000
Most of us are getting out
while we still can.

455
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:45,680
Krempe knows you're here.
What if he tells the authorities?

456
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,320
Good-bye, Henry.

457
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:51,880
Victor, it's me! Elizabeth.

458
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,800
Can you hear me?

459
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,760
Victor, I have to see you.

460
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:03,880
- Go away!
- Please, Victor!

461
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:09,840
I won't leave here
until you see me!

462
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:19,240
Come in the side door.

463
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,320
Alone!

464
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,520
What's happened to you?

465
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:41,160
How can you live here like this?

466
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,760
And that stench!

467
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,800
Don't go in there!

468
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:54,200
- We have to leave. It isn't sate.
- No, I have to stay.

469
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:57,920
- Even it it means you will die?
- Yes.

470
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,920
Well, let me help you.

471
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:14,040
No, that's impossible.

472
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,840
We made a promise.

473
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,840
Victor, I beg you.

474
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:36,640
Look, I know that this is difticult
for you to understand...

475
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:41,000
but I cannot abandon
this work now.

476
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:45,800
It is too important.
Not just tor me, but...

477
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:47,880
believe me, for everyone.

478
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:54,720
And it must come tirst.

479
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:01,480
Betore us?

480
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,840
I love you so much.

481
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:12,280
But--

482
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Good-bye.

483
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:56,360
Oh, God! Elizabeth!

484
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:55,720
Live! Live!

485
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:01,040
Yes!

486
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:48,640
It's alive.

487
00:46:57,760 --> 00:46:59,600
What have I done?

488
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:21,920
Massive birth detects.

489
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:27,520
Greatly enhanced physical strength.

490
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:32,160
But resulting...

491
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:34,440
reanimant...

492
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:38,240
is malfunctional...

493
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:40,360
and pitiful...

494
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:44,600
and dead.

495
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:53,200
Tomorrow, this journal
and its secrets must be destroyed.

496
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:57,040
Forever.

497
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:11,080
Oh, God.

498
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:03,400
You tool, Victor Frankenstein
of Geneva!

499
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:07,080
How could you know
what you'd unleashed?

500
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:10,160
How is it pieced together?

501
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:13,680
With bits ot thieves,
bits ot murderers?

502
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:17,160
Evil stitched to evil
stitched to evil.

503
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:22,440
Do you really believe this thing
will thank you tor its monstrous birth?

504
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:26,280
Evil will have its revenge.

505
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:29,640
God help your loved ones!

506
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:44,840
What do you think you're doing?

507
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:50,160
He's got cholera! He's the one
who's been spreading the plague!

508
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:51,720
Get him!

509
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:16,520
- Get him!
- Kill him!

510
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:29,600
Come here, you--

511
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,520
Keep away trom him!

512
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:40,440
Kill him now!

513
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,120
He went this way!

514
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:47,360
There now. Easy.

515
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:49,600
Easy. Just a bit.

516
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:52,040
That's it.

517
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:54,160
There now. Rest easy.

518
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:57,080
- Henry, you're here.
- Ot course I'm here.

519
00:52:57,160 --> 00:53:00,440
It was touch and go with you, though.
Just a bit more.

520
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:04,240
I teared cholera.
Turned out to be pneumonia.

521
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:07,360
Yes, I'm becoming
something ot a doctor.

522
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:09,680
Even Krempe seems pleased with me.

523
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:12,960
At this rate,
I might even pass anatomy.

524
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:16,840
- The-- The epidemic.
- Dreadtul.

525
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:19,320
There's nothing we can do tor them.

526
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:23,160
The vulnerable,
anyone who's without shelter or tood--

527
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:25,360
the newborn especially will die.

528
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:26,920
Are you sure?

529
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,560
I'm certain ot it.

530
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,880
Thank God.

531
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:35,120
What do you mean?

532
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,760
Nothing.

533
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:50,640
Well, then, that's my shitt tinished.

534
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:57,040
I'll see you later.

535
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:17,160
- Oh, please, forgive me.
- Of course I do.

536
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:24,840
Victor, I don't know
what you were working on.

537
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:28,200
I don't want to know,
but it nearly killed you!

538
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:32,920
It's over. It's tinished.
It should never have started.

539
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:35,800
It's dead!

540
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,600
- Felix.
- Yes?

541
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:34,720
Don't torget the onion scraps.

542
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:38,440
- All right, I've got them.
- Make sure the shed door is shut.

543
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:40,360
Go on! Get!

544
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:42,600
Come on.

545
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:48,480
Get out!

546
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:03,040
- How are the pigs?
- They're happy. They've been ted.

547
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:08,920
- How're your hands?
- They're bleeding again.

548
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,840
Let me see them.

549
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:18,800
That's better.

550
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:24,320
There.

551
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:29,200
- Soup's ready.
- Come on, Grandpa. Sit down.

552
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:31,800
Thank you.

553
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:31,600
We'll never get through the winter
with this yield.

554
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:35,160
The ground's trozen hard.

555
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:37,840
- We'll sell another pig at market.
- We can't.

556
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:41,360
Not until they lift the quarantine.

557
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:43,120
Even then, it's one less tor us.

558
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:45,360
And he'll be back
tor last month's rent soon.

559
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:47,120
Come on !

560
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:49,040
We'll do this together.

561
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:54,240
You're right.

562
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:57,840
We've got to.
Betore the snow comes.

563
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:06,160
Come on, then.

564
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:25,840
The ground's frozen solid.

565
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:28,840
We haven't the strength.
We'd need 20 men to work this tield!

566
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:30,280
It's useless!

567
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:33,800
- We should stop. It's late.
- We don't have enough to eat!

568
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:35,720
We'll manage.

569
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:37,480
Let's go.

570
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:01,320
Look!

571
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:15,800
They must be gitts trom
the good spirit ot the torest!

572
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:19,080
Father, nothing in this lite
comes tree ot cost.

573
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:21,000
I'd like to know who and why.

574
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:23,240
Was it, Grandpa?

575
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:25,960
- Was it the good spirit?
- I believe it was.

576
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:28,880
Will you stop tilling their head
with nonsense?

577
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:50,480
Who's there?

578
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:54,400
Felix? Children?

579
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:08,000
Right.

580
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:11,360
What's this one?

581
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:13,120
"Frie--

582
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:16,120
nd."

583
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:17,680
Friend?

584
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:20,520
Well done!

585
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:23,000
That's very good.

586
01:01:23,080 --> 01:01:25,960
You've got lots of triends,
haven't you?

587
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:28,120
Grandpa's your triend.

588
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:31,560
- Thomas is your triend.
- Friend.

589
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:04,120
Friend.

590
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:08,280
Family.

591
01:02:11,120 --> 01:02:13,640
Father.

592
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:18,280
This is important. You must
travel with him the entire journey.

593
01:02:18,320 --> 01:02:20,240
This equipment must not be
lett unattended.

594
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:22,880
My tather will personally take delivery
in Geneva. Understand?

595
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:24,000
- I do.
- Thank you.

596
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:27,440
- Going somewhere?
- Look at this locket Victor gave me.

597
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:31,160
- Isn't it beautitul?
- Lovely. Is this really you?

598
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:35,640
It's a bad likeness, but tor now,
it'll serve instead ot a ring.

599
01:02:35,720 --> 01:02:38,800
Congratulations!
This is entirely expected!

600
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:40,560
- When?
- As soon as we get home!

601
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:45,280
I can't believe we'll be there
for New Year's eve.

602
01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:47,720
- Victor's taking his tather's practice.
- And expand it.

603
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:50,600
I'm going ahead, now that quarantine's
litted. There's so much to do!

604
01:02:50,680 --> 01:02:53,600
The practice needs a partner.
There's not much money.

605
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:57,800
But there is tood and board
and some very good company.

606
01:02:57,840 --> 01:03:03,080
And it's the ideal position for someone
who has tinally passed anatomy.

607
01:03:03,160 --> 01:03:08,360
So we were wondering it there was
anybody you could recommend?

608
01:03:11,720 --> 01:03:15,400
- I don't know what to say.
- Please say yes.

609
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,760
And you can write that down
in your journal !

610
01:03:39,560 --> 01:03:43,040
"This is the...

611
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:47,200

615
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:06,640
Come on. Quickly!

616
01:04:06,680 --> 01:04:08,760
Oft you go! Quickly now!

Merry Christmas!

618
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:15,760
Come on. Time for bed.

619
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:17,960
In you go.

620
01:04:26,080 --> 01:04:29,920
"For the good spirit...

621
01:04:29,960 --> 01:04:32,760
ot the torest."

622
01:04:46,360 --> 01:04:49,520
Are you the good spirit
ot the torest?

623
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:52,840
Not exactly.
Where's your tather?

624
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:56,320
I said, where's your tather?

625
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:57,680
Who's there? Maggie?

626
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:02,520
Oh. It's you.
What have you done to Maggie?

627
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:05,680
Is he in there,
hiding behind a blind old man?

628
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:07,640
Get away!

629
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:12,440
Don't blame me.

630
01:05:12,520 --> 01:05:15,880
Blame your son
tor not paying his rent on time!

631
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:29,960
Oh, my God!

632
01:05:30,920 --> 01:05:33,960
Thank you so much, my triend.

633
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:38,880
Won't you come sit by the tire?

634
01:05:40,680 --> 01:05:43,560
Please. Don't be atraid.

635
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:46,520
Come.

636
01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:49,040
Come in.

637
01:05:56,680 --> 01:05:58,560
Have a rest. Sit down.

638
01:06:00,560 --> 01:06:01,840
There. That's better.

639
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:03,960
That's better.

640
01:06:05,320 --> 01:06:08,400
I'm glad you tinally came in.

641
01:06:09,320 --> 01:06:12,360
A man shouldn't have to hide
in the shadows.

642
01:06:19,240 --> 01:06:21,160
Better that way.

643
01:06:21,240 --> 01:06:23,720
For me.

644
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:25,880
Why?

645
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:29,920
People are atraid.

646
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:34,360
Except you.

647
01:06:35,680 --> 01:06:37,960
It can't be as bad as that.

648
01:06:42,520 --> 01:06:44,680
Worse.

649
01:06:46,680 --> 01:06:49,760
I can see you with my hands.

650
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:52,680
It you'll trust me.

651
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:13,560
Papa! He hurt Grandpa!

652
01:07:13,640 --> 01:07:16,200
- Who hurt Grandpa?
- What was that noise?

653
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:18,440
- Tell me what the noise was!
- What happened?

654
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:20,360
You poor man.

655
01:07:26,520 --> 01:07:28,560
Have you no friends?

656
01:07:32,080 --> 01:07:36,400
There are some people.

657
01:07:41,320 --> 01:07:44,920
But they don't know me.

658
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,720
Why do you not go to them?

659
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:54,920
Because...

660
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:58,200
I am so very...

661
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:05,800
ugly.

662
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:10,280
And they are...

663
01:08:10,360 --> 01:08:12,400
so very...

664
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:19,880
beautiful.

665
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:21,720
Father!

666
01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:24,680
Get out ot here!
You animal !

667
01:08:24,760 --> 01:08:26,840
- You monster!
- Leave him alone!

668
01:08:29,080 --> 01:08:31,200
It's all right.

669
01:08:32,240 --> 01:08:33,800
We have to leave here.

670
01:10:06,280 --> 01:10:09,320
I will have revenge!

671
01:10:47,720 --> 01:10:49,440
Geneva.

672
01:11:03,800 --> 01:11:05,280
Quickly!

673
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:07,880
She's here! We got your letter!

674
01:11:07,960 --> 01:11:10,120
- Did you?
- It was the tirst one I could read!

675
01:11:10,200 --> 01:11:14,960
- Congratulations! I'm happy tor you.
- Thank you, Justine.

676
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:16,880
Is that the locket?

677
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:20,200
Look how handsome Victor is.

678
01:11:20,240 --> 01:11:22,440
Elizabeth, can I take this
to show Peter?

679
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:25,520
- It's not a toy!
- Let him go. Don't dawdle, William!

680
01:11:34,120 --> 01:11:37,120
Justine, you idiot!
Pay attention !

681
01:11:37,160 --> 01:11:39,080
Anyone would think
you're the one getting married.

682
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:41,000
- Yes, Mother.
- What's wrong?

683
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:43,040
Nothing, really.

684
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:45,680
Just leave it!
You've ruined it now.

685
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:33,480
You! Quickly!

686
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:35,320
- Have you seen Willie?
- Isn't he back yet?

687
01:12:35,400 --> 01:12:39,080
Claude went to see it he lost track
ot time. They say he never arrived.

688
01:12:39,160 --> 01:12:41,560
It's tar too late
tor him to still be out.

689
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:10,440
This isn't a game!

690
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:20,680
It's so late!

691
01:13:22,840 --> 01:13:25,440
We're all so tired.

692
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:27,640
I'm so tired.

693
01:13:29,640 --> 01:13:33,480
Father! I am so pleased to see you!

694
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:40,880
What's wrong?

695
01:14:11,240 --> 01:14:13,440
We checked the east ridge.
There's nothing there.

696
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:15,080
Damn!

697
01:14:20,440 --> 01:14:22,600
We tound him!

698
01:14:24,160 --> 01:14:27,000
I tound him.

699
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:09,320
We did everything we could, sir.

700
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:13,200
You just rest easy now.

701
01:15:13,280 --> 01:15:15,280
We did everything we could.

702
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:18,760
Sir, I'm terrified for my girl.

703
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:20,720
She's still out looking tor William.

704
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:24,520
We parted badly.
I was cruel to her.

705
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:26,280
I didn't mean it!

706
01:15:26,360 --> 01:15:30,120
I think she finds it very hard now
with your wedding.

707
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:32,840
She loves you dearly.

708
01:15:32,920 --> 01:15:36,480
I couldn't bear it it anything happened
to her. She's all I've got.

709
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:38,280
Please help me!

710
01:15:39,720 --> 01:15:42,000
We'll organize another search
now that it's light.

711
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:45,080
We'll tind her, Mrs. Moritz.
I promise.

712
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:51,760
- How is Father?
- His heart is breaking.

713
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:05,800
Mr. Frankenstein, we've apprehended the
murderer, not tive miles trom here...

714
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:07,720
hiding in a barn.

715
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:11,000
We tound this on her.

716
01:16:11,080 --> 01:16:13,000
'Tis yours, I believe, sir.

717
01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:18,720
Sir, you must come immediately.

718
01:16:20,120 --> 01:16:22,000
The townspeople have gone mad.

719
01:16:24,200 --> 01:16:27,280
- What are they doing?
- They must have broken into the jail!

720
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:30,960
- For God's sake! Can't you stop them?
- They've gone wild! It's a lynch mob!

721
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:34,040
Stop! This is unlawtul !

722
01:16:43,680 --> 01:16:46,360
Victor! Help me!

723
01:16:46,440 --> 01:16:48,200
I was trying to tind him!

724
01:16:48,280 --> 01:16:50,400
I went to the lake!

725
01:16:50,480 --> 01:16:54,280
But it was dark!
I wanted to bring him to you !

726
01:16:54,320 --> 01:16:56,880
He must be there tor the wedding!

727
01:16:56,960 --> 01:17:00,360
I'm sorry! He's so tiny!

728
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:37,480
We managed to close the gates
on the mob, Claude.

729
01:17:37,560 --> 01:17:39,880
What about Justine?

730
01:17:39,960 --> 01:17:42,160
We cut her down, sir.
We can bury her in the morning.

731
01:17:42,240 --> 01:17:44,640
Thank you, Claude. Get to bed.

732
01:17:51,040 --> 01:17:53,520
The sea ot ice.

733
01:17:54,600 --> 01:17:56,920
I will meet you there.

734
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,640
On the sea ot ice.

735
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:20,560
Oh, Justine, torgive me.

736
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:22,880
Victor, tell me.

737
01:18:22,920 --> 01:18:26,080
Who is this man?
How do you know he's responsible?

738
01:18:26,160 --> 01:18:29,880
-I'll tell you atter I've destroyed him.
-This is a matter for the police!

739
01:18:29,960 --> 01:18:32,200
They wouldn't understand.

740
01:18:32,240 --> 01:18:33,840
Well, neither do l!

741
01:18:35,240 --> 01:18:37,120
Then just accept it.

742
01:20:21,120 --> 01:20:23,000
Get up.

743
01:20:24,200 --> 01:20:26,560
You do speak.

744
01:20:26,640 --> 01:20:29,200
Yes, I speak.

745
01:20:29,320 --> 01:20:31,200
And read.

746
01:20:32,720 --> 01:20:34,560
And think.

747
01:20:35,920 --> 01:20:38,200
And know the ways ot man.

748
01:20:39,200 --> 01:20:40,720
How did you tind me?

749
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:46,680
Your journal.

750
01:20:50,520 --> 01:20:52,200
Then you mean to kill me.

751
01:20:57,960 --> 01:21:00,960
You murdered my brother, didn't you?

752
01:21:03,240 --> 01:21:07,400
I took him by the throat
with one hand...

753
01:21:07,480 --> 01:21:11,520
and litted him ott the ground.

754
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:15,600
Slowly crushed his neck.

755
01:21:15,680 --> 01:21:20,360
And as I killed him...

756
01:21:20,360 --> 01:21:22,400
I saw your tace.

757
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:28,960
You gave me these emotions...

758
01:21:29,040 --> 01:21:31,320
but you didn't tell me
how to use them.

759
01:21:33,560 --> 01:21:35,520
Now, two people are dead...

760
01:21:37,200 --> 01:21:39,080
because ot us.

761
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:42,760
Why?

762
01:21:44,720 --> 01:21:46,960
There was something at work
in my soul...

763
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:49,200
which I do not understand.

764
01:21:52,040 --> 01:21:54,800
What of my soul? Do I have one?

765
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:59,000
Or was that a part you lett out?

766
01:22:01,320 --> 01:22:05,480
Who were these people
ot which I am comprised?

767
01:22:07,160 --> 01:22:09,880
Good people?
Bad people?

768
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:14,120
- Materials, nothing more.
- You're wrong.

769
01:22:17,240 --> 01:22:19,840
Did you know
I knew how to play this?

770
01:22:21,800 --> 01:22:25,120
In which part ot me
did this knowledge reside?

771
01:22:25,760 --> 01:22:28,040
In these hands?

772
01:22:28,080 --> 01:22:30,840
In this mind?
ln this heart?

773
01:22:31,800 --> 01:22:34,560
And reading.

774
01:22:34,600 --> 01:22:36,720
And speaking.

775
01:22:38,240 --> 01:22:41,600
Not things learned
so much as things...

776
01:22:42,640 --> 01:22:44,040
remembered.

777
01:22:45,160 --> 01:22:47,960
Trace memories in the brain, perhaps.

778
01:22:49,960 --> 01:22:54,360
Did you ever consider
the consequences ot your actions?

779
01:22:56,880 --> 01:22:59,080
You gave me life.

780
01:22:59,120 --> 01:23:02,760
But then you left me to die.

781
01:23:08,680 --> 01:23:10,280
Who am l?

782
01:23:10,360 --> 01:23:11,760
You--

783
01:23:17,480 --> 01:23:19,240
I don't know.

784
01:23:22,760 --> 01:23:25,880
And you think I am evil?

785
01:23:28,240 --> 01:23:30,080
What can I do?

786
01:23:31,040 --> 01:23:35,240
There is something I want.
A triend.

787
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:39,160
Companion.

788
01:23:39,240 --> 01:23:42,200
A temale.

789
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,280
Someone like me...

790
01:23:46,280 --> 01:23:48,080
so she won't hate me.

791
01:23:48,160 --> 01:23:49,960
Like you?

792
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:54,760
Oh, God.
You don't know what you're asking.

793
01:23:55,640 --> 01:23:58,800
I do know that...

794
01:23:59,840 --> 01:24:02,880
with the sympathy ot one living being...

795
01:24:04,120 --> 01:24:07,520
I would make peace with all.

796
01:24:10,640 --> 01:24:13,680
I have love in me,
the likes ot which...

797
01:24:13,760 --> 01:24:17,320
you can scarcely imagine...

798
01:24:18,920 --> 01:24:20,880
and rage...

799
01:24:20,960 --> 01:24:24,000
the likes of which
you would not believe.

800
01:24:27,240 --> 01:24:30,840
It I cannot satisty the one...

801
01:24:32,920 --> 01:24:37,200
I will indulge the other.

802
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:42,000
And...

803
01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:44,480
it I consent...

804
01:24:45,480 --> 01:24:47,040
how will you live?

805
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:53,280
We would travel north,
my bride and l...

806
01:24:53,360 --> 01:24:56,080
to the turthest reaches ot the pole...

807
01:24:57,400 --> 01:25:00,400
where no man has ever set foot.

808
01:25:01,520 --> 01:25:03,520
There...

809
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:05,400
we would live out our lives.

810
01:25:07,240 --> 01:25:08,600
Together.

811
01:25:09,480 --> 01:25:13,560
No human eye
would ever see us again.

812
01:25:15,440 --> 01:25:18,240
This I vow.

813
01:25:20,040 --> 01:25:22,600
You must help me.

814
01:25:23,240 --> 01:25:24,720
Please.

815
01:25:28,400 --> 01:25:31,640
It it is possible
to right this wrong...

816
01:25:34,640 --> 01:25:36,440
then I will do it.

817
01:25:40,680 --> 01:25:42,600
Are you all right?

818
01:25:44,520 --> 01:25:46,640
Yes, I'm all right.
I'm safe.

819
01:25:46,720 --> 01:25:48,840
What happened?

820
01:25:48,920 --> 01:25:50,800
Tell us.

821
01:25:56,080 --> 01:25:59,160
Victor, you have to tell us
what happened!

822
01:25:59,240 --> 01:26:01,280
One month! That's all I ask!

823
01:26:01,320 --> 01:26:04,400
Then we can be married
and torget this whole business!

824
01:26:04,480 --> 01:26:06,600
- I promise!
- Promise?

825
01:26:06,720 --> 01:26:10,920
Don't dare use that word to me!
You promised to tell me who this man is.

826
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,200
You promised to abandon
this work for good!

827
01:26:13,280 --> 01:26:15,840
Your promises don't mean anything.
I have to leave this house.

828
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:18,880
- Where will you go?
- Somewhere I can recover.

829
01:26:18,920 --> 01:26:21,000
This is ridiculous!
I haven't got time to argue!

830
01:26:21,080 --> 01:26:24,840
Isn't it convenient?
Doesn't it tit in with your plans?

831
01:26:24,920 --> 01:26:29,120
Don't you ever think ot anyone
or anything but yourself?

832
01:26:39,440 --> 01:26:41,320
God torgive me.

833
01:28:02,440 --> 01:28:04,040
Why her?

834
01:28:05,400 --> 01:28:08,720
Materials, remember?
Nothing more.

835
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:10,160
Your words.

836
01:28:13,160 --> 01:28:15,120
You will honor your promise to me.

837
01:28:15,200 --> 01:28:17,600
I will not.

838
01:28:17,680 --> 01:28:19,240
Go on. Kill me now.

839
01:28:19,320 --> 01:28:21,600
That is mild compared to what will come.

840
01:28:21,640 --> 01:28:25,800
It you deny me my wedding night,
I will be with you on yours.

841
01:28:32,600 --> 01:28:34,760
Wait! Please wait!

842
01:28:36,080 --> 01:28:37,680
I have to speak to you.

843
01:28:37,760 --> 01:28:39,360
Please!

844
01:28:48,680 --> 01:28:50,440
What do you want to say?

845
01:28:52,360 --> 01:28:54,200
Don't go.

846
01:28:56,440 --> 01:28:57,800
Please.

847
01:28:58,840 --> 01:29:00,680
Don't go.

848
01:29:06,600 --> 01:29:08,800
I'm trightened.

849
01:29:11,920 --> 01:29:13,480
Of what?

850
01:29:17,960 --> 01:29:19,880
I have done something...

851
01:29:21,160 --> 01:29:23,000
so terrible...

852
01:29:24,880 --> 01:29:27,320
so evil.

853
01:29:30,120 --> 01:29:32,840
And I am trightened...

854
01:29:32,880 --> 01:29:35,040
that it I tell you the truth...

855
01:29:37,360 --> 01:29:39,080
that I will lose you.

856
01:29:41,760 --> 01:29:44,560
You'll lose me it you don't.

857
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:49,360
I...

858
01:29:50,680 --> 01:29:53,000
don't know...

859
01:29:56,520 --> 01:29:57,880
what...

860
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:01,320
to do.

861
01:30:36,360 --> 01:30:38,200
Will you marry me?

862
01:30:42,440 --> 01:30:44,320
Marry me today.

863
01:30:46,120 --> 01:30:47,960
Tomorrow...

864
01:30:48,040 --> 01:30:49,880
tell me everything.

865
01:30:52,200 --> 01:30:54,400
But you must tell me the truth.

866
01:30:57,320 --> 01:31:00,640
And together we can face anything.

867
01:31:02,520 --> 01:31:04,360
Whatever you've done...

868
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:07,600
whatever has happened...

869
01:31:09,800 --> 01:31:11,640
I love you.

870
01:31:21,640 --> 01:31:23,640
To share the truth...

871
01:31:23,720 --> 01:31:25,080
the whole truth...

872
01:31:25,160 --> 01:31:27,000
for good or ill.

873
01:31:28,040 --> 01:31:29,920
To stand by each other...

874
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,880
in sickness and in health...

875
01:31:34,400 --> 01:31:36,680
and in joy...

876
01:31:36,760 --> 01:31:40,000
trom this day torward...

877
01:31:40,080 --> 01:31:42,960
till death do you part.

878
01:31:59,920 --> 01:32:02,320
Who is this man?
How shall we know him?

879
01:32:02,400 --> 01:32:04,960
- Believe me, you'll know him.
- He killed Master William.

880
01:32:05,040 --> 01:32:07,120
And Justine Moritz died for it.

881
01:32:07,200 --> 01:32:10,080
No hesitation, lads!
Shoot the bastard on sight!

882
01:32:10,160 --> 01:32:12,800
- Henry.
- Don't worry about a thing.

883
01:32:12,840 --> 01:32:16,520
You two look atter each other.
I'll look atter your father.

884
01:32:56,800 --> 01:32:58,440
$$"Ferry"

885
01:32:58,520 --> 01:33:01,240
I'm sorry, sir.
The last ferry's gone.

886
01:33:01,320 --> 01:33:03,280
- There's nothing there till morning.
- Damn.

887
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:05,400
I'll ride on ahead
and secure you lodgings for the night.

888
01:33:05,480 --> 01:33:07,000
- Thank you.
- Come on.

889
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,240
- Keep your pistols dry!
- They're dry enough.

890
01:33:13,320 --> 01:33:17,440
It they tail, we've others. It those
tail, we can always cut the bastard.

891
01:33:17,480 --> 01:33:19,360
- Go to your post.
- Yes, sir.

892
01:33:22,280 --> 01:33:25,160
Don't worry, sir.
You're well guarded.

893
01:33:26,680 --> 01:33:29,280
Now, why don't you go on upstairs
to your wife.

894
01:33:29,320 --> 01:33:32,320
It's not often a man
has his wedding night.

895
01:33:56,400 --> 01:33:58,280
You're soaking.

896
01:34:07,200 --> 01:34:09,920
Brother and sister no more.

897
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:12,840
Now, husband and wife.

898
01:35:39,920 --> 01:35:41,800
Lock the door.

899
01:35:45,280 --> 01:35:47,560
I saw him in the lightning.
He vanished toward the lake!

900
01:35:47,600 --> 01:35:49,040
You two stay here!

901
01:36:00,320 --> 01:36:02,720
We lost him.

902
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:07,560
Don't bother to scream.

903
01:36:25,680 --> 01:36:27,560
Please, sir.

904
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:30,400
Please don't hurt me.

905
01:36:31,440 --> 01:36:34,680
You're lovelier than I ever...

906
01:36:34,760 --> 01:36:37,160
could have imagined.

907
01:36:50,600 --> 01:36:51,880
I keep my promises!

908
01:37:20,960 --> 01:37:22,800
For God's sake.
Tell me what happened!

909
01:37:22,920 --> 01:37:26,080
No point.
I know what I have to do.

910
01:37:26,120 --> 01:37:28,600
God! No! You can't do this!
I won't let you!

911
01:37:28,680 --> 01:37:30,960
She's gone. I love her.
What would you do?

912
01:37:31,040 --> 01:37:33,160
- Leave her in peace!
- You call this peace?

913
01:37:33,200 --> 01:37:34,720
Father would have
done this tor mother.

914
01:37:34,800 --> 01:37:36,600
Your father's dead!

915
01:37:38,280 --> 01:37:40,120
Then there's nothing lett to lose.

916
01:37:40,240 --> 01:37:42,280
Nothing but your soul.

917
01:39:47,360 --> 01:39:49,760
Live!

918
01:40:22,440 --> 01:40:24,000
Live!

919
01:40:56,360 --> 01:40:58,640
Say my name.

920
01:41:00,320 --> 01:41:01,680
Please.

921
01:41:02,720 --> 01:41:04,440
Say my name.

922
01:41:06,440 --> 01:41:08,800
Remember?

923
01:41:08,880 --> 01:41:10,760
You must remember.

924
01:41:23,480 --> 01:41:25,000
That's it.

925
01:41:27,200 --> 01:41:29,600
That's it. You remember.

926
01:41:33,480 --> 01:41:35,320
That's it.

927
01:41:40,320 --> 01:41:41,960
Now stand.

928
01:41:54,360 --> 01:41:56,040
Up. Yes!

929
01:42:20,680 --> 01:42:22,440
Remember?

930
01:43:11,760 --> 01:43:13,440
She's beautitul.

931
01:43:17,160 --> 01:43:20,520
- She's not tor you.
- Come.

932
01:43:26,480 --> 01:43:28,320
Say my name.

933
01:43:46,040 --> 01:43:47,880
You're beautiful.

934
01:43:52,880 --> 01:43:54,440
Say my name.

935
01:43:56,880 --> 01:43:59,240
Come to me.

936
01:45:05,120 --> 01:45:07,560
Say my name.

937
01:45:11,720 --> 01:45:13,600
That's right.

938
01:45:17,320 --> 01:45:18,600
You're mine.

939
01:45:23,160 --> 01:45:25,840
Leave her alone! No!

940
01:45:25,920 --> 01:45:29,440
- Get away trom her! She's mine!
- She said my name! She remembers!

941
01:45:29,520 --> 01:45:31,040
She's mine!

942
01:46:22,920 --> 01:46:24,760
All that I once loved...

943
01:46:24,840 --> 01:46:27,520
Iies in a shallow grave...

944
01:46:27,560 --> 01:46:29,440
by my hand.

945
01:46:33,400 --> 01:46:36,320
I tollowed the trail
he lett tor me.

946
01:46:37,360 --> 01:46:38,760
North.

947
01:46:39,680 --> 01:46:42,440
Always north.

948
01:46:42,520 --> 01:46:44,360
For months now.

949
01:46:45,720 --> 01:46:47,560
With one intent.

950
01:46:49,640 --> 01:46:51,480
To kill him.

951
01:46:54,600 --> 01:46:56,120
Now...

952
01:47:00,720 --> 01:47:02,240
I'm tired.

953
01:47:06,600 --> 01:47:08,160
I'm so...

954
01:47:09,480 --> 01:47:12,320
very, very tired.

955
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:29,920
What did he say?

956
01:47:31,680 --> 01:47:33,560
He's dead.

957
01:47:35,400 --> 01:47:37,560
He died raving...

958
01:47:37,640 --> 01:47:40,600
about some phantom.

959
01:47:40,680 --> 01:47:42,960
What is it out there, Captain?

960
01:47:47,080 --> 01:47:50,000
He told me a story that...

961
01:47:53,360 --> 01:47:55,240
couldn't be true.

962
01:47:56,880 --> 01:47:58,760
He was mad.

963
01:48:00,360 --> 01:48:02,200
I think.

964
01:48:04,720 --> 01:48:06,600
A warming breeze.

965
01:48:09,880 --> 01:48:12,000
The ice will melt yet.

966
01:48:12,760 --> 01:48:14,920
And what then, Captain?

967
01:48:21,120 --> 01:48:23,280
- We head north.
- No.

968
01:48:46,440 --> 01:48:48,520
Who are you?

969
01:48:51,960 --> 01:48:54,680
He never gave me a name.

970
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:22,880
Why do you weep?

971
01:49:25,240 --> 01:49:27,720
He was my father.

972
01:49:30,400 --> 01:49:34,000
"And, yea, I gave my heart
to know wisdom...

973
01:49:34,080 --> 01:49:36,640
and to know madness and tolly.

974
01:49:36,720 --> 01:49:40,840
And I perceived that all is vanity...

975
01:49:40,920 --> 01:49:43,080
and vexation ot spirit.

976
01:49:43,160 --> 01:49:47,200
For in much wisdom
is much griet.

977
01:49:47,280 --> 01:49:49,560
And he that increaseth knowledge...

978
01:49:49,640 --> 01:49:52,200
increaseth sorrow.

979
01:49:52,280 --> 01:49:55,240
For God shall bring every work...

980
01:49:55,320 --> 01:49:58,040
and every secret thing
into judgement...

981
01:49:59,400 --> 01:50:01,880
whether it be good...

982
01:50:01,920 --> 01:50:03,760
or whether it be evil."

983
01:50:11,840 --> 01:50:15,520
- Captain, we--
- He has a right to bear witness.

984
01:50:26,320 --> 01:50:29,520
- Jesus! It's breaking up!
- The ice is giving way!

985
01:50:32,440 --> 01:50:34,080
Help me!

986
01:50:38,520 --> 01:50:40,640
Get back to the ship, Captain!

987
01:50:41,360 --> 01:50:43,960
Leave the damn torch!

988
01:50:46,760 --> 01:50:48,040
Come with us!

989
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:52,520
I am done with man.

990
01:51:03,640 --> 01:51:05,520
Hang on ! I've got you!

991
01:51:05,600 --> 01:51:06,960
Help!

992
01:51:11,960 --> 01:51:14,760
Here, Captain!
Take my hand!

993
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:25,160
Where to now, Captain?

994
01:52:37,160 --> 01:52:38,560
Home.
