1
00:01:17,343 --> 00:01:21,609
When I first met Clarice in college,
I was completely sprung.

2
00:01:24,217 --> 00:01:28,244
She was smart, passionate, driven.

3
00:01:28,455 --> 00:01:30,423
The sweetest thing I'd ever met.

4
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:33,657
You know the kind of woman
I'm talking about, right?

5
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:35,555
The got-your-back kind of woman?

6
00:01:36,663 --> 00:01:39,063
I did what a good man does
when he finds the woman...

7
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:41,199
...he's been dreaming about
his whole life.

8
00:01:41,401 --> 00:01:42,891
I went all the way.

9
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:48,564
For if one falls down,
the other is there to pick him up.

10
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:49,799
That's right.

11
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:54,469
Even better
is a cord of three strands...

12
00:01:55,248 --> 00:01:58,115
...because it is not easily broken.

13
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:06,090
My brother, my sister,
life is going to try to knock you down.

14
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:07,384
Amen.

15
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:11,086
And it's hard to keep
the good in a good marriage...

16
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:12,764
...when bad things happen.

17
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:19,196
The two of you represents
the first two strands.

18
00:02:21,007 --> 00:02:24,408
But God represents the third.

19
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:28,581
And as long as you stay
close to him...

20
00:02:28,781 --> 00:02:31,614
...your marriage
will be a three-stranded cord...

21
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:34,616
...this world can never break.

22
00:02:52,572 --> 00:02:54,631
-l love you.
-l love you.

23
00:02:56,109 --> 00:03:00,102
Congregation,
Mr. and Mrs. David Johnson.

24
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:06,545
On our wedding night...

25
00:03:06,753 --> 00:03:09,916
...it was just the two of us
in a little slice of heaven.

26
00:03:11,424 --> 00:03:13,688
We didn't come up for air
for two days.

27
00:03:27,307 --> 00:03:30,367
Together,
we had goals and dreams.

28
00:03:30,577 --> 00:03:32,841
We were going places in this world.

29
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:36,439
She was gonna be
a real-estate rainmaker.

30
00:03:36,649 --> 00:03:38,617
I was gonna be
a major-league ball player...

31
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:41,912
...with hall-of-fame numbers,
a big contract...

32
00:03:42,121 --> 00:03:45,284
...an entrepreneur, daddy.

33
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:47,550
The big life.

34
00:03:48,294 --> 00:03:51,491
Till it all ended shattering my leg
sliding into home plate...

35
00:03:51,698 --> 00:03:55,759
...during the final game
of my rookie season.

36
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:09,941
Yeah, that's how young love
always starts out.

37
00:04:11,784 --> 00:04:14,753
Feels like the honeymoon
will last forever.

38
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,254
But like the bishop said...

39
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:27,228
...life has a way
of knocking the hell out of you.

40
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:30,702
-Oh, hey, baby, sorry l'm late.
-Hey, baby.

41
00:04:30,903 --> 00:04:33,371
There was this bumper-to-bumper
traffic on the 5.

42
00:04:33,573 --> 00:04:34,972
-lt's okay.
-But look at you.

43
00:04:35,174 --> 00:04:39,406
Look at you in my little favorite,
sexy, big, grown-girl outfit.

44
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:42,072
Oh, no, baby,
l just touched my face up.

45
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:43,806
Can't go there.

46
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:45,450
All right.

47
00:04:46,886 --> 00:04:48,183
-This is it.
-What's that?

48
00:04:48,388 --> 00:04:50,379
This new property
l've been dying to show.

49
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:52,455
l think l'm gonna get
an offer on it soon.

50
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:54,217
-When are you showing it?
-Tonight.

51
00:04:54,427 --> 00:04:55,917
-Oh, baby, not tonight.
-Why?

52
00:04:56,329 --> 00:04:59,696
You know, l thought we could get
a little quality time, you know?

53
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:02,197
Oh, God, Dave,
l would love to spend quality time.

54
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:05,235
But, you know,
my commissions pay for this house.

55
00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:08,339
And besides, these clients could pay
for that new work truck...

56
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:10,338
...we've been dying to get you.

57
00:05:10,543 --> 00:05:13,103
You think l want
my big, strong, chocolate kiss...

58
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,508
...driving around
in that beat-up old thing?

59
00:05:16,282 --> 00:05:19,410
David, you're building
a business, okay?

60
00:05:19,619 --> 00:05:20,984
And appearance is everything.

61
00:05:21,187 --> 00:05:22,916
lt's about time we put the pro back...

62
00:05:23,122 --> 00:05:25,147
...in Dave's All Pro
Building and Remodeling.

63
00:05:25,358 --> 00:05:27,451
Appearance is everything,
that's what you said?

64
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,958
l'm saying, you can't show up
to someone's house...

65
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:32,597
...talking about you're here
to remodel and rebuild...

66
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,494
...in that beat-up old rusty truck.

67
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:37,295
-l happen to like that truck with rust.
-lt's a bucket.

68
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:40,666
-The rust, everything, l like that truck.
-Okay, okay, okay.

69
00:05:40,873 --> 00:05:45,207
What about this weekend,
you and l close ourselves in...

70
00:05:45,411 --> 00:05:48,574
...and try out that new Jacuzzi tub
we bought?

71
00:05:48,915 --> 00:05:50,576
l like that idea.

72
00:05:50,783 --> 00:05:52,876
-But it has to be after Saturday.
-Why?

73
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:54,951
l'm meeting the boys
and team on Saturday.

74
00:05:55,154 --> 00:05:56,451
-The boys?
-But....

75
00:05:56,656 --> 00:06:00,456
But after that-- After that, it can then
be just you and me, and me and you.

76
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:04,562
And then we could talk
about little miniature you and mes.

77
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:06,493
Oh, God, please.
Don't press your luck.

78
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:10,999
And there goes our quality time,
so that's on you, brother.

79
00:06:11,604 --> 00:06:14,732
-Are you gonna hoop later?
-Yeah, meet Brock and Tree about 7.

80
00:06:14,941 --> 00:06:18,809
Good, good, you know, because l feel
a little extra around the middle section.

81
00:06:19,011 --> 00:06:20,706
-You ain't feeling--
-Yes, l do, baby.

82
00:06:20,913 --> 00:06:24,815
l'm feeling a little spare tire.
Get your hoops on tonight.

83
00:06:25,017 --> 00:06:26,507
-For-- For real, you feel--
-Yeah.

84
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:29,483
-You don't-- You--
-l'll see you later, okay?

85
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:56,337
Good morning.

86
00:06:56,549 --> 00:06:58,278
You've been holding out on me,
Clarice.

87
00:06:58,484 --> 00:07:01,681
-What?
-You didn't tell me you was...

88
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:04,556
...taking Oprah and Stedman
out to look at houses.

89
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:07,624
Oh, hush, girl,
that's Mr. and Mrs. Reid.

90
00:07:07,827 --> 00:07:10,694
He's a federal judge
and she's a chichi art dealer.

91
00:07:10,897 --> 00:07:13,092
They're looking to get
into a new zip code.

92
00:07:13,299 --> 00:07:15,494
Well, you are already
Salesperson of the Year.

93
00:07:15,701 --> 00:07:17,726
How come you can't throw
your girl charity...

94
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:20,064
...and help me meet
my quota for the month?

95
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:23,970
Because, sister girl, that's not how
l got to be Salesperson of the Year.

96
00:07:24,177 --> 00:07:26,042
When you live the life,
you pay the price.

97
00:07:26,245 --> 00:07:28,236
And these bills
are about to strangle me.

98
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,313
What about Dave?

99
00:07:30,516 --> 00:07:32,541
Go make that money, girl.

100
00:07:32,752 --> 00:07:35,243
Sorry l asked.

101
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:39,754
Hey, Eminem, Eminem,
you wanna turn that down a little bit?

102
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:40,948
Sorry, man.

103
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,355
Give my neighbors a heart attack.

104
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:45,297
You guys think l'm getting fat?

105
00:07:45,498 --> 00:07:47,261
-You what?
-What did you say?

106
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,765
Yeah, Reesie says
it looks like l'm gaining weight.

107
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:51,459
lf she's says it's your ass, yes.

108
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:52,968
Yes, your ass did get bigger.

109
00:07:53,172 --> 00:07:54,696
Not looking at my ass, are you?

110
00:07:54,907 --> 00:07:57,671
lf l am looking at your ass right now,
l got good reason to.

111
00:07:57,877 --> 00:08:00,539
Since Vanessa got pregnant,
she won't let me see her naked.

112
00:08:00,746 --> 00:08:02,611
So ass is an ass right now.

113
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:05,283
l can't wait to play ball today.

114
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,248
l'm giving everybody a good play.

115
00:08:07,453 --> 00:08:10,115
Speaking of big asses,
how did that disposition thing go...

116
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:11,688
...with your divorce attorney?

117
00:08:11,891 --> 00:08:14,451
-You mean, deposition, Tree?
-Depo-- That's what l said.

118
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:15,957
-Yeah, right.
-What did l say?

119
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:19,131
-You said disposition.
-All right, l'm sorry, human thesaurus.

120
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,926
-How did your deposition go?
-Oh, man, it's ridiculous.

121
00:08:22,134 --> 00:08:23,328
l'm a dead man.

122
00:08:23,536 --> 00:08:26,869
Fiona's gonna try to take everything.
My house, this car, half my salary.

123
00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:28,472
That is ridiculous, man.

124
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:31,040
What, she gonna let you keep
the big screen, though?

125
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:33,712
Please tell me
she not gonna take your big screen.

126
00:08:33,913 --> 00:08:35,312
-Oh, damn.
-That--

127
00:08:35,781 --> 00:08:37,271
Can we talk about something else?

128
00:08:37,483 --> 00:08:39,951
-You know, l will leave that alone.
-Thank you.

129
00:08:40,152 --> 00:08:43,349
You over here worried
about your weight, he's losing a TV.

130
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,386
-All right, all right. Come on. Let's go.
-Come on, y'all.

131
00:08:56,936 --> 00:08:58,369
Damn.

132
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:02,197
Keep away from him, keep away.

133
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:07,076
Putting it up.

134
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:18,754
-Oh, no.
-Shake it off, babe.

135
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:21,017
Don't bring that here.
Don't bring that here.

136
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:22,353
What was that?

137
00:09:27,366 --> 00:09:29,357
-Get off me.
-What was that, man?

138
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:32,367
Chill, yo.
Darnell, what's wrong with--?

139
00:09:33,105 --> 00:09:35,630
Bringing in here street ball.
You brought it in here.

140
00:09:35,841 --> 00:09:37,536
-That's what's wrong.
-Check yourself.

141
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:39,438
You ain't in the prison yard no more.

142
00:09:39,645 --> 00:09:40,634
-What?
-You heard me.

143
00:09:40,846 --> 00:09:42,677
You don't know
what you're talking about.

144
00:09:42,882 --> 00:09:44,975
You don't know
what you're talking about.

145
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:47,880
-Ball up top, ball up top.
-Yeah, ball up top.

146
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:50,180
-l got my integrity, boy.
-Don't drop the soap.

147
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:52,983
You ain't nothing like you used to be.
l see how you are.

148
00:09:53,192 --> 00:09:55,990
-Whatever. You-- l'm from the 'hood.
-You not from the 'hood.

149
00:09:56,195 --> 00:09:58,425
-You ain't from the 'hood?
-l know where l'm from.

150
00:09:58,631 --> 00:10:00,496
-You're acting like you're not.
-Whatever.

151
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:03,168
-You Starbucks soldier.
-Don't drop the soap.

152
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:04,393
Starbucks security.

153
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,970
Get out of here with this bull--

154
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:09,141
Hey, watch out, Dave.

155
00:10:12,044 --> 00:10:13,841
Oh, that's it, huh?
Game's over, huh?

156
00:10:14,046 --> 00:10:16,310
What are you...?
Aren't you with him?

157
00:10:16,515 --> 00:10:17,641
Why are you still here?

158
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:19,283
You're not on our side.

159
00:10:19,752 --> 00:10:22,016
Big, just bully for no reason.

160
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,284
He's starting to shoot.
He's shooting.

161
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:28,054
Look at that view.

162
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,694
Big garage there,
lt's beautiful, solar-lit.

163
00:10:30,896 --> 00:10:32,420
Now, isn't this beautiful?

164
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:34,156
Look at this open space.

165
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:37,734
And what l love about this house
for you, Judge Reid...

166
00:10:37,937 --> 00:10:41,464
...are the floor-to-ceiling built-ins
in the study for all of your law books.

167
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:44,643
And for you, Mrs. Reid,
the east-facing front door.

168
00:10:44,844 --> 00:10:46,277
So feng shui.

169
00:10:47,213 --> 00:10:48,544
Feng what?

170
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:50,841
lt's Chinese, baby.
lt means harmony.

171
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:54,714
l assume the sellers
are looking for full price.

172
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:58,287
Well, we can ask, but l doubt
they will be willing to come down.

173
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:01,423
But there aren't many homes
in this neighborhood...

174
00:11:01,627 --> 00:11:04,687
...with a garage big enough
for your vintage-car collection.

175
00:11:04,897 --> 00:11:06,489
How did you know
about my Corvettes?

176
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:10,499
Oh, l make it my business to know
the unique needs of all of my clients.

177
00:11:11,771 --> 00:11:14,399
l think l'd like to see
how my chi flows...

178
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:17,872
-...through the master bedroom.
-Sure. l'll leave this with the judge.

179
00:11:18,077 --> 00:11:19,806
Wait until you see
the bedroom balcony.

180
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:21,070
The view is spectacular.

181
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,373
Funk shwa.

182
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:26,643
Don't know why Darnell
needs to hate like that.

183
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:29,412
Come on, man. l kind of thought
we'd been over this, D.

184
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:31,988
Yeah, it was 1 5 years ago.
He needs to get over it.

185
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:34,421
-Got three more.
-You gotta look at it like this.

186
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:38,256
-He feel he got dealt a bad hand.
-Nobody forced him to sling that crack.

187
00:11:38,464 --> 00:11:41,661
Well, he just needs to realize
that life isn't always fair, man.

188
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:43,095
Believe me, l know.

189
00:11:43,502 --> 00:11:46,164
Come on, now, just what part...

190
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:48,863
...of your magnificent life
are you whining about now?

191
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:50,508
What are you talking about, man?

192
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,644
l'm getting screwed
by the divorce lawyers.

193
00:11:52,845 --> 00:11:54,676
Well, B, you act
like you don't know why.

194
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,745
You getting screwed
because you a hound.

195
00:11:56,949 --> 00:12:00,009
-l'm not a hound.
-You get more tail than a public toilet.

196
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,187
True, but with Fiona,
l was always faithful.

197
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,549
l mean, l may have browsed,
but l never bought.

198
00:12:04,757 --> 00:12:06,486
-You never bought?
-l never bought.

199
00:12:06,692 --> 00:12:07,681
-Never bought?
-Never.

200
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:09,918
What about the Thai massages
you like to get?

201
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:12,188
All right, so what?
l bought once or twice.

202
00:12:12,665 --> 00:12:14,223
See, that's your problem, man.

203
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:16,401
Me, personally, l don't browse,
l don't buy.

204
00:12:16,602 --> 00:12:18,866
l keep my eyes straight ahead.
l'm focused.

205
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,699
l don't see nothing else.
l even turned in my player card.

206
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:24,068
Yeah, man, l feel you.
Clarice has radar.

207
00:12:24,643 --> 00:12:27,703
She can even see my eyes moving
behind my sunglasses.

208
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:29,346
You wanna know what l do,
though?

209
00:12:29,548 --> 00:12:31,482
When l wake up,
l just tell Vanessa sorry.

210
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:33,914
l don't care if l did anything.
l tell her sorry.

211
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,054
l tell her sorry
about 1 0 times a day. Why?

212
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:38,416
Because if l do something,
l already apologized.

213
00:12:38,624 --> 00:12:40,455
She has nothing to say.
Makes her happy.

214
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:42,889
And a happy wife equals what?
A happy husband.

215
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:45,461
That isn't living.
That's just breathing.

216
00:12:45,664 --> 00:12:47,154
Hey, l tell you what.

217
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:50,961
l'm not the one losing my big screen.
And why is the chair so low?

218
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:53,035
Put it so l can use the machine, Brock.

219
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:56,231
-Julie, Julie. That's my girl.
-Who's that?

220
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:58,740
-My girl, Julie.
-Dave.

221
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:01,913
And the guy at the front desk
says she's single.

222
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:03,103
So am l.

223
00:13:03,315 --> 00:13:04,577
Well, almost.

224
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:08,242
Tell me why you walked over here.
What are you even looking at?

225
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:09,580
This is not our ballpark.

226
00:13:09,989 --> 00:13:13,356
We're focusing, Brock.
Eyes on the prize.

227
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:16,527
l got my eyes on the prize.

228
00:13:19,031 --> 00:13:21,693
Hey, looking good. Keep going.

229
00:13:22,601 --> 00:13:25,161
Keep pushing, Bryson. Don't quit.

230
00:13:25,604 --> 00:13:26,628
Keep pushing, buddy.

231
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:28,204
Last half lap.

232
00:13:28,874 --> 00:13:30,364
Push to the end, Bryson.

233
00:13:30,576 --> 00:13:33,044
Finish strong, buddy. Kick it.

234
00:13:33,245 --> 00:13:34,769
Good. Good job, buddy.

235
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:37,846
Great heat, baby.

236
00:13:39,218 --> 00:13:40,810
How did that feel, Bryson?

237
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,317
Good, l guess.

238
00:13:42,521 --> 00:13:44,318
Feel that good?

239
00:13:45,257 --> 00:13:46,849
New record.

240
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,857
Remember to count your strokes so
you know when you're near the wall.

241
00:13:51,063 --> 00:13:52,496
You see that scar?

242
00:13:52,698 --> 00:13:53,858
No accidents.

243
00:13:54,066 --> 00:13:56,534
-Sorry, coach, l forgot that time.
-All right.

244
00:13:56,735 --> 00:13:59,568
Now, with the regional finals
coming up, what would you say...

245
00:13:59,772 --> 00:14:02,206
...if l included your freestyle
in the 400 medley?

246
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:05,336
lt's the 1 4-year-olds,
but l want you to start steering...

247
00:14:05,544 --> 00:14:07,944
...toward the Junior Olympics
for next year.

248
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:10,408
l'll take that as a yes.

249
00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:13,277
-We're gonna get some pizza.
-l'm so excited.

250
00:14:13,485 --> 00:14:16,318
-Mom, stop, it's embarrassing.
-Why? l'm excited.

251
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:19,685
You just cleaned the clocks
of a bunch of high school freshmen.

252
00:14:23,295 --> 00:14:25,058
Baby, you awake?

253
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,330
l am now.

254
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:33,232
Are you drunk?

255
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:35,270
No, l'm not drunk.

256
00:14:35,841 --> 00:14:39,004
-Just had a beer with the fellas.
-That's nice.

257
00:14:39,745 --> 00:14:42,111
-You know what l was thinking?
-What?

258
00:14:42,314 --> 00:14:48,344
l was thinking that we need to get back
to the loving part of our marriage.

259
00:14:48,787 --> 00:14:50,152
l know what this is about.

260
00:14:50,356 --> 00:14:52,256
Trying to keep up
with Tree and Vanessa.

261
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:56,292
-No, l ain't trying to keep up--
-Yes, you are, yes, you are.

262
00:14:56,495 --> 00:15:01,899
l just look at you, and l just think that
we could have some beautiful babies.

263
00:15:02,334 --> 00:15:07,203
David, how many times
do we have to have this discussion?

264
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:08,737
l'm not ready for babies.

265
00:15:08,941 --> 00:15:11,000
Would you move over?
lt's hot in here.

266
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:12,700
l'm not ready for babies.

267
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:15,779
l have a career, l have dreams,
l have places l wanna go.

268
00:15:15,981 --> 00:15:18,279
-l do too.
-A baby's just gonna get in the way.

269
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:21,510
Besides, you're building a business,
okay?

270
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,621
You can't come home
all hours of the night...

271
00:15:24,823 --> 00:15:28,259
...after drinking with your boys,
and then expect to have sex...

272
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:31,452
...like rabbits all night long.

273
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:35,992
Oh, by the way,
l need you home by 5:00 tomorrow...

274
00:15:36,201 --> 00:15:37,361
...for my awards ceremony.

275
00:15:37,569 --> 00:15:38,900
Yeah.

276
00:15:39,505 --> 00:15:40,699
Whatever.

277
00:15:43,542 --> 00:15:45,976
Like that rag on your head.

278
00:15:47,012 --> 00:15:48,673
That's why you're not getting any.

279
00:15:49,648 --> 00:15:50,637
There we go, get it.

280
00:15:50,849 --> 00:15:52,749
Keep your butt down.
Keep your butt down.

281
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:55,386
See the ball into the glove.
You'll get it, Marcus.

282
00:15:55,587 --> 00:15:57,179
All right, here we go.

283
00:15:58,557 --> 00:16:00,024
Get in there.

284
00:16:00,225 --> 00:16:02,693
-There you go.
-Good play, that's what l like to see.

285
00:16:02,895 --> 00:16:05,159
-That's what l like to see.
-Yeah, boy, yeah, boy.

286
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:07,389
Who's your daddy now, sucker?

287
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:08,827
Please, cracker.

288
00:16:09,034 --> 00:16:11,468
You looking like your white mama
making that play.

289
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:13,535
-What?
-Hey, not today.

290
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:14,728
Hey.

291
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,407
Hey.

292
00:16:16,709 --> 00:16:19,041
-Just let go.
-Go, fight, fight, fight.

293
00:16:19,244 --> 00:16:20,268
Get-- Hey, hey.

294
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,468
-What--?
-Come on, man.

295
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,375
-Get your hands--
-Break it up.

296
00:16:23,582 --> 00:16:25,812
-Boy, you better get up.
-Bring it in.

297
00:16:26,018 --> 00:16:27,849
-Get up.
-Bring it in.

298
00:16:30,055 --> 00:16:33,286
Des, what's wrong with you, huh?
How many times do l have to tell you?

299
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:36,984
Nobody is gonna disrespect
anybody on this team.

300
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:38,390
You got that?

301
00:16:39,398 --> 00:16:40,729
Now, both of you look at me.

302
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,458
What race am l?

303
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:43,965
Black.

304
00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:45,700
Wrong.

305
00:16:45,904 --> 00:16:47,769
You know what Brother King said?

306
00:16:47,973 --> 00:16:51,500
He said l'm human first,
then l'm black.

307
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:54,640
There's only one race of people,
and that's the human race.

308
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:58,248
But there's two kinds of people,
the good ones and bad ones.

309
00:16:58,717 --> 00:17:00,207
Now, Darius, look at Coach Brock.

310
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:03,920
What race is he?

311
00:17:04,456 --> 00:17:05,923
White.

312
00:17:07,626 --> 00:17:09,287
We're gonna have to work on that.

313
00:17:09,495 --> 00:17:11,861
Hit the bases. Let's go.

314
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,499
What are you saying, man?

315
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,168
Martin Luther King
never said those words.

316
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:18,495
No, that was Tyrone King.

317
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:21,366
You know, he owns that barber shop
down there on Florence.

318
00:17:21,573 --> 00:17:22,835
You're lying. l know Tyrone.

319
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:25,306
He stutter.
He don't even talk like that.

320
00:17:25,511 --> 00:17:28,139
Look, look, we got company, dude.

321
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,113
Come on.

322
00:17:32,851 --> 00:17:35,081
You gotta get up out of here
with that King Cobra.

323
00:17:35,287 --> 00:17:37,847
l ain't got to get up
out of nowhere, man.

324
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,389
l can come see my boy
anywhere l want to.

325
00:17:40,592 --> 00:17:42,617
Not drunk on your ass, you can't.

326
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:45,353
lt's a bad influence on the boys
and against league rules.

327
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:46,929
Get out of here, man, come on.

328
00:17:47,132 --> 00:17:49,100
Oh, what, you gonna go
get the police on me?

329
00:17:49,301 --> 00:17:51,826
Because of the rules,
you gonna go get the police on me?

330
00:17:52,037 --> 00:17:54,096
All right,
l ain't gonna cause no trouble.

331
00:17:54,306 --> 00:17:55,967
Darius, let's go.

332
00:17:56,175 --> 00:17:57,403
Coach said we gotta go.

333
00:17:57,609 --> 00:17:59,133
l ain't finished playing yet.

334
00:17:59,344 --> 00:18:00,333
What?

335
00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:03,743
Man, get your ass over here right now.
l said it's time to go.

336
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:07,145
-God.
-l'll drag your ass out of here.

337
00:18:07,352 --> 00:18:09,081
Get over here now.

338
00:18:10,823 --> 00:18:13,053
Who you talking to like that?

339
00:18:13,692 --> 00:18:16,092
Better not ever talk to me
like that, boy.

340
00:18:17,563 --> 00:18:19,929
No wonder Darius has an attitude.

341
00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:22,259
With him as his father.

342
00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:24,197
Well, see, he's his daddy.

343
00:18:24,403 --> 00:18:26,337
He's a long way
from being his father, man.

344
00:18:26,538 --> 00:18:28,904
Let's go. Here we go.

345
00:18:32,077 --> 00:18:33,669
Why you gotta make me
quit the team?

346
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:37,542
You better watch how you talk to me,
boy, before l put my foot in your ass.

347
00:18:39,751 --> 00:18:41,378
But l wanna play ball like you did.

348
00:18:41,587 --> 00:18:43,646
Oh, now you're saying
you wanna be like me?

349
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:47,151
You really wanna be like me,
then buck up.

350
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:48,417
Do you see me out there?

351
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:52,393
l ain't chasing after no empty dreams
in no field wasting my damn time.

352
00:18:52,598 --> 00:18:55,362
l'm in the real world.
You wanna come to the real world?

353
00:18:55,567 --> 00:18:58,764
Because the real world eats your ass
and spits your ass out.

354
00:19:00,405 --> 00:19:02,032
Wake up.

355
00:19:03,242 --> 00:19:05,335
Stop dreaming.

356
00:19:26,532 --> 00:19:29,194
Did you really forget
about my awards ceremony?

357
00:19:29,401 --> 00:19:32,268
l know, l just got carried away
with the boys, baby, all right?

358
00:19:32,471 --> 00:19:35,998
-Give me five minutes. Five minutes.
-You are so insensitive and selfish.

359
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:39,644
Everything is about you
and those damn boys.

360
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:44,980
Do you have any idea
how important this night is for me?

361
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:47,049
How hard l've worked for us?

362
00:19:47,252 --> 00:19:50,346
Or what an honor it is
to be Salesperson of the Year?

363
00:19:50,556 --> 00:19:52,615
Look, l know it's a big night
for you, okay?

364
00:19:52,824 --> 00:19:55,884
l'm sorry. l got a little caught up
on the field, l apologize.

365
00:19:56,094 --> 00:19:58,062
Why do you waste your time
with those boys?

366
00:19:58,263 --> 00:20:00,823
Clarice, don't start. Don't start.

367
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:03,695
You know how important it is for me
to be coaching kids.

368
00:20:03,902 --> 00:20:06,302
They're not gonna do nothing
but end up in prison...

369
00:20:06,505 --> 00:20:08,439
...like their ghetto-pass-carrying
daddies.

370
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,973
l saw your lips moving, but it was
your mother's nagging-ass voice--

371
00:20:12,177 --> 00:20:14,907
You leave Mama out of this.
You leave Mama out of this.

372
00:20:15,314 --> 00:20:17,805
All l know is if you spent
half of the time at home...

373
00:20:18,016 --> 00:20:20,280
...you do with those boys,
we wouldn't be having--

374
00:20:20,485 --> 00:20:22,510
-Look, l said l was sorry.
-Oh, whatever--

375
00:20:38,937 --> 00:20:40,529
Clarice.

376
00:20:42,007 --> 00:20:44,066
Clarice, baby, you okay?

377
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:55,250
-All right, what do you got for me?
-BP is 85l55.

378
00:20:55,454 --> 00:20:57,820
-Resp. is 1 2 and falling.
-Distal pulse is dropping.

379
00:20:58,023 --> 00:21:00,389
-We got a line in.
-There's obvious abdominal edema.

380
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:02,059
-Get the O.R. ready.
-l'll call.

381
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:03,751
-Come on, people, let's go.
-Move.

382
00:21:03,962 --> 00:21:05,156
We will take care of her.

383
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:07,662
-Someone needs to take care of that.
-She needs me.

384
00:21:07,866 --> 00:21:09,891
-lt's hospital policy.
-All right, all right.

385
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:12,696
-You're hurt, we'll take care of you.
-l got it.

386
00:21:15,374 --> 00:21:17,308
Why don't you spend
a few moments with her?

387
00:21:17,509 --> 00:21:19,204
She's still coming out of anesthesia.

388
00:21:19,411 --> 00:21:22,903
She's under a lot
of pain medication.

389
00:21:23,849 --> 00:21:25,441
You got one tough cookie here.

390
00:21:25,651 --> 00:21:28,620
She told me l wasn't allowed
to remove any of her body parts...

391
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:30,913
...without her permission.

392
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:32,988
That's my Reesie.

393
00:21:33,992 --> 00:21:36,017
Tough as nails.

394
00:21:36,228 --> 00:21:39,789
Can l speak to you outside
for a minute?

395
00:21:39,998 --> 00:21:42,398
Mr. Johnson,
this is a very severe injury.

396
00:21:42,601 --> 00:21:44,967
lf she doesn't wanna park
in the handicapped spot...

397
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:48,537
...the rest of her life, she's gonna need
months of physical therapy.

398
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:51,231
You need to make her
understand that.

399
00:21:51,543 --> 00:21:52,874
Okay.

400
00:21:53,512 --> 00:21:55,571
-Are you gonna be all right?
-Yeah, thank you.

401
00:21:55,781 --> 00:21:57,078
You're welcome.

402
00:21:58,383 --> 00:22:00,180
How is she doing?

403
00:22:00,786 --> 00:22:02,845
Her leg was broke pretty bad.

404
00:22:03,055 --> 00:22:05,046
ls she gonna be all right?

405
00:22:05,757 --> 00:22:07,224
Yeah.

406
00:22:07,859 --> 00:22:09,554
lt could've been
a lot worse, though.

407
00:22:09,761 --> 00:22:12,321
Yeah, it makes you count
your blessings.

408
00:22:12,531 --> 00:22:14,999
You gonna be able to take over
the team for a while?

409
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,031
-Yeah, don't worry about it.
-Yeah, yeah.

410
00:22:17,235 --> 00:22:19,669
We do most of the work
anyway, right?

411
00:22:20,038 --> 00:22:22,939
Here, look,
l got Clarice some flowers.

412
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:24,566
She'll like these.

413
00:22:24,776 --> 00:22:27,506
Yeah, l got you a bear.

414
00:22:27,713 --> 00:22:28,975
You got him a bear?

415
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:30,978
Yes, l got him a bear.

416
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:34,050
-You bought that for him?
-Brock, yes, l brought him-- Yes.

417
00:22:34,252 --> 00:22:35,310
lt's my money.

418
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,885
Clarice Johnson.

419
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:38,920
l'm looking for Clarice Johnson.

420
00:22:39,124 --> 00:22:41,422
-She's in Recovery, right there.
-Thank you.

421
00:22:41,626 --> 00:22:43,685
Dave, Dave.

422
00:22:43,895 --> 00:22:46,489
Okay, okay, what--?
Just tell me what happened.

423
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:48,290
She's okay, all right?

424
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:51,094
-Now, she had to have surgery--
-Surgery.

425
00:22:51,303 --> 00:22:54,500
-Why didn't you call me sooner?
-Everything was happening so fast.

426
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:55,934
l wasn't thinking straight.

427
00:22:56,141 --> 00:22:59,042
lt looks like you had time to call
everybody else. Where is she?

428
00:22:59,244 --> 00:23:00,677
-We're gonna go.
-We're gonna go.

429
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:02,312
-Nice to see you.
-What happened?

430
00:23:02,514 --> 00:23:05,142
-Okay, where is she?
-Okay, it was an accident, all right?

431
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:08,285
Somebody ran a red light and hit us.
lt just came from nowhere.

432
00:23:08,487 --> 00:23:10,216
You know what?
l don't wanna hear that.

433
00:23:10,422 --> 00:23:13,289
She called me when she was at home
waiting for you.

434
00:23:13,492 --> 00:23:16,256
Now, if you hadn't been late
coaching those kids...

435
00:23:16,862 --> 00:23:20,093
...you would've paid more attention.
You wouldn't have been in a hurry.

436
00:23:20,298 --> 00:23:21,629
This is your fault, Dave.

437
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:23,095
This is your fault.

438
00:23:23,301 --> 00:23:24,427
Now, where is she?

439
00:23:25,203 --> 00:23:26,966
Two-fifteen.

440
00:23:35,046 --> 00:23:38,413
Once, I heard a radio host
ask the question:

441
00:23:39,217 --> 00:23:42,186
''Why do bad things happen
to good people?''

442
00:23:45,023 --> 00:23:47,719
During Clarice's weeks
in the hospital...

443
00:23:48,126 --> 00:23:50,458
...we asked that question a lot.

444
00:23:56,368 --> 00:23:59,804
I tried to be there for her
in every way a husband should.

445
00:24:00,238 --> 00:24:03,264
But it just seemed
like it was never enough.

446
00:24:03,475 --> 00:24:05,306
And when we came home...

447
00:24:05,911 --> 00:24:09,904
...the reality that everything
had changed began to sink in.

448
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:12,811
-We gonna get you through this.
-We?

449
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:17,718
We aren't the ones with their leg
twisted up like a damn pretzel.

450
00:24:19,157 --> 00:24:21,785
Got everything in the house
already taken care of for you.

451
00:24:21,993 --> 00:24:24,860
We got about a week's worth
of meals in the freezer.

452
00:24:25,063 --> 00:24:26,826
When we get inside....

453
00:24:27,399 --> 00:24:28,889
-You all right?
-Yeah.

454
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,864
When we get inside, l'm gonna warm
you up a hot little plate.

455
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:34,038
-Oh, boy.
-And get some food. l got you.

456
00:24:34,239 --> 00:24:36,366
-l've moved in.
-Mama.

457
00:24:36,575 --> 00:24:37,701
Hey, baby.

458
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:41,870
Well, don't just stand there.
Bring her on in.

459
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:45,106
Look, l appreciate your concern
and all that, but l got this, okay?

460
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:48,650
l'm capable of taking care of my wife,
and l got-- l got you, baby, okay?

461
00:24:48,854 --> 00:24:51,914
Dave, l figured l was gonna have
to break this down to you.

462
00:24:52,123 --> 00:24:54,591
Now, if things was jiggy as all that...

463
00:24:54,793 --> 00:24:56,886
...l wouldn't have to be here now,
would l?

464
00:24:57,095 --> 00:24:59,222
-Okay.
-Like l said, bring her on in here.

465
00:24:59,431 --> 00:25:02,491
-Come on.
-l'm so glad you're here, Mama.

466
00:25:02,701 --> 00:25:03,725
l'm here, baby.

467
00:25:03,935 --> 00:25:04,924
-Dave.
-See that?

468
00:25:05,136 --> 00:25:07,001
-That's what l'm talking about.
-l got it.

469
00:25:07,205 --> 00:25:08,832
-Be careful with her.
-l got it.

470
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,474
So rough.

471
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:16,508
-She already had one accident.
-Now you gonna break my other foot.

472
00:25:16,715 --> 00:25:18,444
l know, that's what l'm talking about.

473
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:25,379
The only way you're gonna get
Mama out of the house...

474
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:27,820
...is to get Clarice back on her feet.

475
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:32,486
The doctor told me she wants me
to get Clarice into physical therapy.

476
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:34,995
Oh, you know--?
Remember that girl l had my eye on?

477
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,599
-Which girl?
-No, the girl--

478
00:25:36,801 --> 00:25:39,793
-lt's the girl over at the pool, Julie.
-Oh, okay, l do.

479
00:25:40,005 --> 00:25:42,769
Word around the club
is she's one of the top therapists.

480
00:25:42,974 --> 00:25:45,704
You should give her a call.
See if she makes house calls.

481
00:25:45,911 --> 00:25:49,472
-There you go.
-And then, you know, let me know.

482
00:25:50,081 --> 00:25:51,446
You know what D's problem is?

483
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:54,141
He hasn't learned from the lessons
l've learned from.

484
00:25:54,352 --> 00:25:56,843
l try to tell you things,
but you do not listen, man.

485
00:25:57,055 --> 00:25:59,216
The other night,
Vanessa's taking a bubble bath.

486
00:25:59,424 --> 00:26:01,892
She's in the tub, looking good.

487
00:26:02,093 --> 00:26:05,654
Normally, that's my green light to go in
there and do what l'm supposed to do.

488
00:26:05,864 --> 00:26:10,096
So l go in there, to get a little cuddly
with her, and she shoved me off.

489
00:26:10,302 --> 00:26:12,702
Like, pushed me.
She's bigger than me, you know that.

490
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:14,496
So when she pushed me, l fell back.

491
00:26:14,706 --> 00:26:17,368
And she was like, you know,
''Get away, you stinky man.''

492
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:19,441
Now, what l need to know--
Not wanna know.

493
00:26:19,644 --> 00:26:21,737
What l need to know,
am l a stinky man?

494
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:23,509
Seriously, like, do l smell?

495
00:26:23,715 --> 00:26:27,412
Am l the friend that stink and
y'all don't tell me, because we close?

496
00:26:27,619 --> 00:26:29,780
-Do l have stinky breath?
-l don't know.

497
00:26:29,988 --> 00:26:31,888
-Do l have stinky breath?
-l don't know.

498
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:33,955
-Tell me. Smell my breath.
-l'm not gonna.

499
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:35,990
-Smell my breath.
-l'm not gonna smell--

500
00:26:36,194 --> 00:26:38,219
You're gonna smell my breath.

501
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:41,629
-l figured that.
-l'm telling you, man.

502
00:26:41,833 --> 00:26:46,861
Even after everything Fiona and l
have been through, l still miss her.

503
00:26:47,072 --> 00:26:51,133
-Are you serious?
-lt's something about the way she....

504
00:26:51,343 --> 00:26:52,469
She crosses those legs...

505
00:26:52,677 --> 00:26:57,239
...and she just bounces
those high heels up and down.

506
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:59,849
My thing is when l just get home...

507
00:27:00,051 --> 00:27:02,451
...Reesie's just getting out
the shower.

508
00:27:02,654 --> 00:27:06,613
She puts on one
of my little old tank tops.

509
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:09,290
Starts painting her toenails.

510
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:11,091
You know what l like?

511
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:12,490
l like it....

512
00:27:12,697 --> 00:27:17,225
l like it when Vanessa has me rub
this skin cream on her back.

513
00:27:17,435 --> 00:27:19,733
She's got bad eczema.

514
00:27:19,938 --> 00:27:21,462
Big bumps on her back.

515
00:27:21,673 --> 00:27:23,368
And it needs to be moisturized.

516
00:27:23,575 --> 00:27:25,805
And l do it. l do it.

517
00:27:26,011 --> 00:27:31,005
lt's a little rocky moisturizing roll
on her back, but l don't mind.

518
00:27:31,216 --> 00:27:34,708
Because that's what she has me do,
you know.

519
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:36,819
-Years l've been doing that.
-Tree.

520
00:27:37,722 --> 00:27:39,280
-Are you crying?
-What?

521
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:43,723
-Are you crying? No, look at me.
-Come on, l'm enjoying myself, right?

522
00:27:43,928 --> 00:27:45,953
-You are crying.
-l'm not crying, man.

523
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:47,722
lt's not even tears, man.

524
00:27:47,932 --> 00:27:51,026
l feel like these women
got us in a beam, so we--

525
00:27:51,236 --> 00:27:56,196
They got us in one of them
Star Wars contractor-beam things.

526
00:27:56,408 --> 00:27:58,774
lt's pulling us in.
You know what l'm talking about?

527
00:27:58,977 --> 00:28:03,243
lt's like we couldn't escape that beam
if we wanted to, you know.

528
00:28:03,448 --> 00:28:05,541
lt's like you want to, but you love it.

529
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:07,581
You love it so much that you can't.

530
00:28:07,786 --> 00:28:09,344
You can't escape it.

531
00:28:09,954 --> 00:28:12,855
lt's an interesting way of putting it,
Star Wars.

532
00:28:13,058 --> 00:28:16,255
-That's what you said, Star Wars?
-Star Wars, man, it's a beam.

533
00:28:16,461 --> 00:28:18,861
lt's a beam, it's like a light.
They shine it at you.

534
00:28:19,397 --> 00:28:22,423
lt mess with your body, your nerves
and stuff, and you can't move.

535
00:28:22,634 --> 00:28:25,296
You just gotta allow yourself
to get pulled in.

536
00:28:25,503 --> 00:28:27,937
And l'm getting pulled in.

537
00:28:28,139 --> 00:28:31,336
You need to get pulled in
and you need to get pulled in.

538
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:32,874
Accept it, man.

539
00:28:33,078 --> 00:28:34,841
Accept your life.

540
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:36,513
-l accept mine.
-No, no, no.

541
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:38,706
-You're right, l probably had enough.
-Yeah.

542
00:28:38,917 --> 00:28:40,282
l probably had too many.

543
00:28:44,756 --> 00:28:48,624
-Oh, no, honey, we're not buying--
-l got this, l got this.

544
00:28:48,827 --> 00:28:51,091
l hope l have the right address.
l'm Julie Sawyer.

545
00:28:51,296 --> 00:28:53,321
You called for an in-home
physical therapist?

546
00:28:53,531 --> 00:28:54,691
-Yeah, that's right.
-Okay.

547
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:56,924
-Dave Johnson, come on in.
-Nice to meet you.

548
00:28:57,135 --> 00:29:00,002
Reesie, this is the physical therapist
l was telling you about.

549
00:29:00,205 --> 00:29:03,174
Please have a seat.
This is Miss Sawyer.

550
00:29:03,374 --> 00:29:06,537
And l'm Mrs. Clark, her mother.

551
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:08,508
How do you do?

552
00:29:09,214 --> 00:29:10,408
Mrs. Johnson?

553
00:29:11,216 --> 00:29:14,549
Look, Mrs. Johnson,
l know after all you've been through...

554
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:17,551
...the last thing you want
is a stranger in your life, so....

555
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:19,553
How about we get to know
each other--?

556
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:24,161
l'm not looking for anyone
to psychoanalyze me either.

557
00:29:24,796 --> 00:29:29,233
Okay, well, that's good,
because that's not why l'm here.

558
00:29:30,368 --> 00:29:31,733
But, you know, to be honest...

559
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:34,166
...talking about how you're feeling
emotionally...

560
00:29:34,372 --> 00:29:36,670
...can help me design a better plan
to get you on--

561
00:29:39,477 --> 00:29:42,969
How l feel.
Lord Jesus, where did y'all find her?

562
00:29:43,181 --> 00:29:45,979
How l feel?
You wanna know how l feel?

563
00:29:46,184 --> 00:29:49,017
l feel like Humpty Dumpty,
that's how l feel.

564
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:51,586
Clarice, you need to calm down.

565
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:54,350
Let this woman do her job.

566
00:29:54,859 --> 00:29:56,918
Now, you do know
what you're doing, right?

567
00:29:57,128 --> 00:29:58,959
Yes, ma'am.

568
00:29:59,164 --> 00:30:02,292
Mrs. Johnson, l understand.

569
00:30:04,035 --> 00:30:06,868
So why don't l just come back
tomorrow, and we'll begin then?

570
00:30:07,071 --> 00:30:08,766
Bingo, that's a great place to start.

571
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:11,066
How about you come back never?
What about that?

572
00:30:11,276 --> 00:30:14,939
-That works for me.
-Okay, no, we're gonna do this today.

573
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:17,114
And you're gonna calm down.

574
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:19,745
You stop acting like this.

575
00:30:19,951 --> 00:30:22,044
Come on now.

576
00:30:22,754 --> 00:30:26,884
Just leave me alone, okay?
Just leave me alone.

577
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:33,293
Just....

578
00:30:39,971 --> 00:30:43,168
The bishop used to tell a story
about Adam and Eve.

579
00:30:43,374 --> 00:30:46,502
When God made Adam,
he instructed him to do three things:

580
00:30:46,711 --> 00:30:50,875
-Work, cultivate, protect.
-Two, three, down.

581
00:30:51,416 --> 00:30:55,011
-That's great.
-Oh, my God, that's incredible, okay.

582
00:30:55,987 --> 00:30:58,182
What we're gonna do today
is have a little fun.

583
00:30:59,057 --> 00:31:01,321
Down through history,
men have been measured...

584
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:04,256
...by how hard they've worked
and cultivated...

585
00:31:04,462 --> 00:31:07,659
...by how well they've protected
their wives and children.

586
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:12,400
Down, three, two, one.

587
00:31:12,604 --> 00:31:18,042
Up again. Up, one, two, three, hold.

588
00:31:18,243 --> 00:31:19,301
In the old days...

589
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:23,970
...women saw their men
as conquerors, providers, heroes.

590
00:31:24,182 --> 00:31:26,207
But somewhere along the line,
that changed.

591
00:31:26,651 --> 00:31:28,380
Push, push.

592
00:31:28,586 --> 00:31:30,850
Women started becoming
their own heroes.

593
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:32,215
Okay, how's this there?

594
00:31:32,423 --> 00:31:35,119
Maybe it was because their men
forgot how to be heroic.

595
00:31:36,461 --> 00:31:39,487
Or because women
didn't wanna be protected anymore.

596
00:31:39,697 --> 00:31:42,325
Or maybe women
had to be their own heroes...

597
00:31:42,533 --> 00:31:45,696
...because of the pain
they had to endure in life.

598
00:31:58,716 --> 00:32:00,081
Look, he's handsome.

599
00:32:00,285 --> 00:32:02,082
-Bryson.
-Bryson.

600
00:32:02,287 --> 00:32:04,778
He's so handsome.

601
00:32:05,823 --> 00:32:08,121
But whatever the cause...

602
00:32:08,326 --> 00:32:11,989
...the world took away
a man's reasons for being a man.

603
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:15,827
They told him
he wasn't important anymore.

604
00:32:16,034 --> 00:32:18,002
And when that happened...

605
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:22,533
...it turned the whole world
upside-down.

606
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,778
-l don't know how to thank you.
-You don't need to.

607
00:32:31,983 --> 00:32:33,917
You really don't.
You know what you can do?

608
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:36,484
You could write a letter
to my boss at the clinic...

609
00:32:36,688 --> 00:32:39,782
...saying you've never met a skilled
or more professional therapist.

610
00:32:39,991 --> 00:32:41,288
l wanna thank you too, Julie.

611
00:32:41,492 --> 00:32:43,289
Look at her.
She's doing extremely well.

612
00:32:43,494 --> 00:32:45,826
Yes, you are truly gifted
at what you do.

613
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:47,292
Thank you.

614
00:32:49,534 --> 00:32:51,092
-Okay, l'll see you Monday?
-Yeah.

615
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:52,929
-Okay, great.
-Get home safely, okay?

616
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:54,126
-l will.
-Take care.

617
00:32:54,339 --> 00:32:56,273
-Enjoy your evening, okay?
-l will.

618
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:58,442
-Hey, baby.
-Hey, what's up?

619
00:32:59,243 --> 00:33:01,040
Not much.

620
00:33:04,115 --> 00:33:06,549
No, no, no, don't worry.
lt does it all the time.

621
00:33:06,751 --> 00:33:08,776
lt's probably just the battery.
l'll be fine.

622
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:12,787
-lt sounds more than just the battery.
-No, no, please go on inside, go on.

623
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:14,822
Nonsense,
you can't be late for your son.

624
00:33:15,026 --> 00:33:16,391
-Dave will run you home.
-Good.

625
00:33:16,594 --> 00:33:18,459
-No, it's my hoop night.
-Hoops night?

626
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:21,223
l ain't gonna miss my night.
l can call her a tow truck.

627
00:33:21,432 --> 00:33:24,162
Miss your hoops, are you insane?

628
00:33:24,369 --> 00:33:27,338
You're missing the point here.
This woman saved your wife's life.

629
00:33:27,538 --> 00:33:30,302
-He can miss his hoops.
-Okay, l don't wanna put anyone out.

630
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:34,205
-lt'll make me feel worse, please.
-Little girl, little girl.

631
00:33:34,412 --> 00:33:36,539
Get your ass in this car.

632
00:33:40,251 --> 00:33:41,240
Let me ask a question.

633
00:33:41,452 --> 00:33:46,219
l have a friend who has actually
been wanting to ask you out on a date.

634
00:33:46,758 --> 00:33:48,191
-Me?
-Yeah, you.

635
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:50,687
But he's in a complicated situation.

636
00:33:50,895 --> 00:33:52,726
Oh, God, no, don't tell me.

637
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:55,421
He's recently broken up
or getting divorced...

638
00:33:55,633 --> 00:33:58,067
...or lives with his mother?

639
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:00,329
Getting divorced.

640
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:03,006
No, l appreciate that,
but l think l'll pass.

641
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:05,232
Single mothers
don't have a lot of options...

642
00:34:05,443 --> 00:34:09,709
...but l don't really need
to be his rebound relationship.

643
00:34:10,314 --> 00:34:11,872
lf it's all the same.

644
00:34:13,017 --> 00:34:14,450
So how long
has he been swimming?

645
00:34:14,652 --> 00:34:17,678
Oh, as soon as l could get him
in the water. He loves it.

646
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:20,019
-Hey, Bry.
-Hi, Mom.

647
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:22,385
This is Dave. His wife's my patient.

648
00:34:22,593 --> 00:34:24,561
-Remember, the ones in the accident?
-Right.

649
00:34:24,762 --> 00:34:26,696
-How do you do, sir?
-How's it going?

650
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:30,561
My car broke down again,
but Dave offered to give us a ride.

651
00:34:30,768 --> 00:34:31,757
Cool.

652
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:34,135
So you like baseball, Bryson?

653
00:34:34,338 --> 00:34:36,238
Well, l've always wanted to try it.

654
00:34:36,441 --> 00:34:37,738
But Mom throws like a girl.

655
00:34:37,942 --> 00:34:39,034
Watch it.

656
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:41,609
Well, l coach a team
over at East Side Field...

657
00:34:41,813 --> 00:34:44,247
...and if you want,
you could stop by some time...

658
00:34:44,449 --> 00:34:46,212
...and l could show you
a few pointers.

659
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:47,714
-Really?
-Yeah.

660
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:50,717
That would be totally sick.

661
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:51,911
Oh, ours is....

662
00:34:52,123 --> 00:34:53,385
The street up there.

663
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:56,719
The minute l get in the house,
l'll call for a tow for that car.

664
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:58,418
You don't have to do that.

665
00:34:58,629 --> 00:35:00,460
l know a mechanic
that owes me a favor...

666
00:35:00,665 --> 00:35:02,394
...so l'll have him take a look at it.

667
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,828
Clarice and l owe you.

668
00:35:04,035 --> 00:35:05,935
-Are you sure?
-Yeah, no problem.

669
00:35:06,137 --> 00:35:07,661
Thank you.

670
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:17,414
All right.

671
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:18,639
-All right.
-Lord, yes.

672
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:19,908
Oh, yeah.

673
00:35:21,219 --> 00:35:23,414
-All right.
-Praise the Lord.

674
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:25,755
-Hallelujah.
-Hallelujah.

675
00:35:26,757 --> 00:35:28,748
Hallelujah.

676
00:35:33,231 --> 00:35:36,359
Jesus called out to the multitudes.

677
00:35:36,567 --> 00:35:39,593
-He said, ''Come to me.
-Come.

678
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:44,104
-All who are weary, come to me.
-Come to me.

679
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:46,242
-And l will give you rest.''
-Yes, he will.

680
00:35:46,444 --> 00:35:50,608
He said, ''l will give you rest
if you come to me.''

681
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:51,804
Amen.

682
00:35:52,016 --> 00:35:56,214
So today, l want you to stand up
and come down to the altar.

683
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:57,409
Come down.

684
00:35:57,622 --> 00:36:00,147
I always felt church
is like a hospital.

685
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:03,491
It's where sick people go
to get well.

686
00:36:03,694 --> 00:36:06,561
Anybody out there
that needs praying for today.

687
00:36:06,764 --> 00:36:09,198
Or maybe you just need
just a little encouragement.

688
00:36:09,867 --> 00:36:10,925
Jesus said....

689
00:36:11,135 --> 00:36:14,593
Whenever I went to church,
I felt hope.

690
00:36:14,805 --> 00:36:17,774
Come on, come to me.

691
00:36:17,975 --> 00:36:20,102
-Yes.
-Amen.

692
00:36:20,311 --> 00:36:21,573
Glory, hallelujah.

693
00:36:21,779 --> 00:36:25,476
Girl, when l saw you,
hey, l almost went in.

694
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:28,083
l said my D was looking
like Miss America...

695
00:36:28,286 --> 00:36:29,548
-...up in here.
-Stop it.

696
00:36:29,754 --> 00:36:32,416
l hope this don't mean you're about
to come back to work...

697
00:36:32,623 --> 00:36:34,682
...and l gotta start fighting you
for clients.

698
00:36:34,892 --> 00:36:36,917
-Well....
-Oh, you know, l meant to tell you.

699
00:36:37,128 --> 00:36:40,427
Mr. Hastings forced me to take some
of your clients while you were gone.

700
00:36:40,631 --> 00:36:41,996
Girl, don't worry about that.

701
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,293
-l would do the same thing to you.
-Okay.

702
00:36:44,502 --> 00:36:47,266
But you better bring
your boxing gloves to work.

703
00:36:47,471 --> 00:36:49,598
Girl, l can't fight.
l just got my nails done.

704
00:36:49,807 --> 00:36:51,900
You crazy, come here, girl.

705
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:55,004
lt was really good to see you folks
in church today.

706
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:58,114
Well, with what we've been through,
it's good to be seen.

707
00:36:58,316 --> 00:37:00,011
The Lord's been good, bishop.

708
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:02,652
Clarice has got her trainer,
has her walking again...

709
00:37:02,853 --> 00:37:05,845
...and Dave's been a real trouper.

710
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:08,082
No, no, you have.

711
00:37:08,292 --> 00:37:11,261
We are here for you, 2 4l7.

712
00:37:11,462 --> 00:37:13,362
Even if you just wanna come in
and talk.

713
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:15,998
-Come here.
-lt is so good to see you.

714
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,498
-You too, love you.
-l love you too, girl.

715
00:37:18,703 --> 00:37:19,761
-Okay.
-See you tomorrow.

716
00:37:19,971 --> 00:37:21,268
You better bring your gloves.

717
00:37:21,472 --> 00:37:23,064
l'm glad it ain't a street fight...

718
00:37:23,274 --> 00:37:26,243
...because you know l don't wanna get
my face scratched up.

719
00:37:26,444 --> 00:37:28,503
Hey, baby, how you doing?

720
00:37:28,713 --> 00:37:30,772
-Okay, take care of my girl.
-Todd, let's go.

721
00:37:30,982 --> 00:37:32,847
Come on, now,
you know l'm hungry.

722
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:34,483
l got to get to brunch.

723
00:37:34,685 --> 00:37:35,913
You're walking all slow.

724
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:45,229
lt's sickening, man.

725
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:47,761
He really disgusts me, dude.

726
00:37:48,733 --> 00:37:51,327
-Hi, Julie.
-Yes?

727
00:37:51,535 --> 00:37:55,301
l'm Brock Houseman.
l'm a friend of Dave Johnson's.

728
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,535
Yeah, l....

729
00:37:57,742 --> 00:37:59,334
Has he mentioned me at all?

730
00:38:00,711 --> 00:38:02,736
Yeah-- No, well....

731
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:06,007
Bet you $ 1 0, he's gonna take
all the credit for fixing the car.

732
00:38:06,217 --> 00:38:09,516
You fixed my car?
l don't know what to say.

733
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,950
-No, don't.
-Thank you. No, you don't understand.

734
00:38:12,156 --> 00:38:13,851
Don't say anything. lt's my pleasure.

735
00:38:14,058 --> 00:38:16,083
Why are we even here?
Tell me why we're here.

736
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:17,818
We're part of the problem, man.

737
00:38:18,029 --> 00:38:20,190
-No, we're accomplices.
-No, we're not, you are.

738
00:38:20,398 --> 00:38:22,491
-All right.
-You drove, l'm not a part of this.

739
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:24,327
-Look at him.
-Look, look, look.

740
00:38:24,535 --> 00:38:26,503
What? Why are you so happy?

741
00:38:27,538 --> 00:38:30,632
-What?
-Nothing, nothing at all, Satan.

742
00:38:30,841 --> 00:38:32,138
Satan? Hey, hey, l--

743
00:38:32,343 --> 00:38:34,038
l can't help it. l am not ashamed.

744
00:38:34,245 --> 00:38:36,839
-Get in the back.
-l have no problem getting in the back.

745
00:38:37,048 --> 00:38:38,675
Better not tell Vanessa l was here.

746
00:38:39,216 --> 00:38:40,513
So l think you can see...

747
00:38:40,718 --> 00:38:43,812
...how a retail space in this
neighborhood can be a home run.

748
00:38:44,021 --> 00:38:46,489
Well, l like what l see, Clarice.

749
00:38:46,691 --> 00:38:50,058
-lt's actually quite impressive, really.
-Yeah, it has lots of potential.

750
00:38:50,261 --> 00:38:52,786
Excuse me,
who will be taking the check?

751
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:55,295
-We will. Sure?
-No, no, no, l got it.

752
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:56,659
-Please, l insist.
-No, l--

753
00:38:56,867 --> 00:38:57,925
-l insist.
-No, l got it.

754
00:38:58,135 --> 00:38:59,727
-Are you sure?
-Yeah, l'm positive.

755
00:38:59,937 --> 00:39:01,598
Go ahead, Dave.

756
00:39:05,609 --> 00:39:08,100
-Thank you very much.
-You're so welcome.

757
00:39:08,312 --> 00:39:10,746
lt's nice to see you back up
on your feet now.

758
00:39:10,948 --> 00:39:13,314
lt is so good to be back.

759
00:39:13,718 --> 00:39:15,549
l can only imagine.

760
00:39:15,753 --> 00:39:18,813
Dave, tell me, l'm interested
in getting your perspective.

761
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:22,015
What's it like to have a wife
who is as progressive as Clarice?

762
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:25,688
Well, you know,
anything Clarice puts her mind to...

763
00:39:25,896 --> 00:39:29,161
...is gonna be successful,
so you guys are in good hands.

764
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:30,834
Oh, impressive.

765
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:33,526
As a general contractor,
l thought you might be able...

766
00:39:33,738 --> 00:39:35,763
...to weigh in
and share your perspectives...

767
00:39:35,973 --> 00:39:38,840
...from a professional level
on the architectural flow chart...

768
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:40,772
...that she's presented to us today.

769
00:39:40,978 --> 00:39:43,572
Well, see, with this particular project,
my approach....

770
00:39:43,781 --> 00:39:46,511
l mean, l would approach it
in a way that....

771
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:50,384
Actually, the projects l work on
are a little bit smaller.

772
00:39:50,588 --> 00:39:53,523
-About 3000 to 5000 square feet.
-Dave, Dave, don't be so--

773
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:58,127
He's just being modest. David owns
a very lucrative construction company.

774
00:39:58,329 --> 00:39:59,591
-Really?
-Yes, sweetheart.

775
00:39:59,797 --> 00:40:02,561
l was just letting them know
that the projects l normally--

776
00:40:02,767 --> 00:40:05,429
You don't have to let everybody
know everything. lt's okay.

777
00:40:05,636 --> 00:40:08,400
-We're looking to get into--
-l was just telling the man--

778
00:40:08,606 --> 00:40:11,439
-Don't tell the man everything.
-Maybe we could work together.

779
00:40:11,642 --> 00:40:15,078
You might be able to be the general
contractor, do the finish-out work.

780
00:40:15,279 --> 00:40:17,907
-Yeah.
-Perfect, l think that's a great idea.

781
00:40:18,115 --> 00:40:21,312
Excuse me, sir, l'm sorry,
but your card has been declined.

782
00:40:21,752 --> 00:40:23,549
You know what?
lt's gotta be a mistake.

783
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:25,779
-We'll take care of it.
-No, no, no, l can--

784
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:27,787
Let me give you another credit card.

785
00:40:27,992 --> 00:40:30,483
Did l bring it with me?
l brought the American Express.

786
00:40:30,694 --> 00:40:32,127
-Do l have it?
-Think you got it.

787
00:40:32,329 --> 00:40:34,991
-Clarice, please.
-No, l can do it.

788
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:37,258
l'll handle this.

789
00:40:37,468 --> 00:40:38,901
Thank you.

790
00:40:41,372 --> 00:40:42,566
Thank you.

791
00:40:48,245 --> 00:40:49,678
Nice music.

792
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:52,974
Oh, and the food....

793
00:41:00,491 --> 00:41:03,722
l've never been so humiliated
in all of my life.

794
00:41:03,928 --> 00:41:06,624
-You realize how you made me look?
-How l made you look?

795
00:41:06,831 --> 00:41:10,062
Well, if l embarrassed you in front
of Mr. Big-Time-Development-Head...

796
00:41:10,267 --> 00:41:11,291
...that's too damn bad.

797
00:41:11,502 --> 00:41:14,335
Think twice before you open
your big-ass mouth talking about--

798
00:41:14,538 --> 00:41:19,703
Big-ass-- lt is irresponsible of you to
be over your limit on your credit card.

799
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:22,276
Do you mean to tell me
you don't have $200?

800
00:41:23,447 --> 00:41:25,278
-l'm done.
-While you was recuperating...

801
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:28,145
...l was the only one bringing money
up into this house.

802
00:41:28,352 --> 00:41:29,580
l was the one paying bills.

803
00:41:29,787 --> 00:41:31,414
Overextended? lt's because of you.

804
00:41:31,622 --> 00:41:35,752
-This mortgage's about to bankrupt us.
-Oh, please, don't be so dramatic.

805
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:39,123
This mortgage
is not going to bankrupt us.

806
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:42,094
And as soon as l clean up
this little mess you made...

807
00:41:42,299 --> 00:41:43,357
...we will be fine.

808
00:41:43,567 --> 00:41:46,900
We're gonna take the insurance
money, put it down on an Escalade.

809
00:41:47,104 --> 00:41:50,369
l just let you talk me into buying a 300.
We ain't buying no Escalade.

810
00:41:50,574 --> 00:41:54,340
My clients don't ride in anything
but an Escalade, okay?

811
00:41:54,545 --> 00:41:58,811
-They're gonna be walking, then.
-Hey, hey, hey, settle down.

812
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:00,979
l can hear y'all all the way upstairs.

813
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:04,348
And if l can hear you,
the whole neighborhood can hear you.

814
00:42:04,555 --> 00:42:05,988
And you know what, Dave?

815
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:08,488
l've been waiting to tell you this
for a long time.

816
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:10,592
Maybe if you stop
spending so much time...

817
00:42:10,794 --> 00:42:13,490
...with them little gangsters-in-training
down there...

818
00:42:13,697 --> 00:42:16,962
...and spend more time in this house
handling your business...

819
00:42:17,167 --> 00:42:19,397
...you wouldn't be having
this argument right now.

820
00:42:19,603 --> 00:42:21,833
You better stop talking
about my boys like that.

821
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:23,802
Now, look, l said what l got to say.

822
00:42:24,008 --> 00:42:25,976
You know what, Mama?
l got this, l got this.

823
00:42:26,176 --> 00:42:29,543
David, l have worked too hard
to get us to where we are...

824
00:42:29,747 --> 00:42:32,716
...and hell will freeze over
before l let you take us backward--

825
00:42:32,917 --> 00:42:34,612
-Know what you need to work on?
-What?

826
00:42:34,818 --> 00:42:38,049
Work on not being in a fantasyland,
trying to be somebody that you not.

827
00:42:38,255 --> 00:42:40,246
Hey, hey, hey, wait a minute.

828
00:42:40,991 --> 00:42:43,425
-Don't talk to my daughter like that.
-That's my wife.

829
00:42:43,627 --> 00:42:46,790
-l'll talk to her any way l want.
-Don't talk to my mother like that.

830
00:42:46,997 --> 00:42:49,465
Are you crazy?
Have you lost your mind?

831
00:42:53,003 --> 00:42:54,766
l'm out of here.

832
00:42:57,041 --> 00:43:01,478
-Wait a minute, Dave--
-Hey, don't you dare run after him.

833
00:43:24,568 --> 00:43:28,595
Sometimes when you don't know
where to turn...

834
00:43:28,806 --> 00:43:31,434
...you got to turn to what you know.

835
00:43:31,642 --> 00:43:36,579
I knew my chair, my records,
my music.

836
00:43:38,048 --> 00:43:42,542
Only problem is,
when the song is over...

837
00:43:42,953 --> 00:43:45,547
...you're right back
where you started.

838
00:43:52,730 --> 00:43:56,359
l'm telling you, l don't know how much
longer l can put up with all this drama.

839
00:43:56,567 --> 00:43:59,934
Then why don't you just try to sit
Clarice down and talk it all through?

840
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:02,037
l could talk all day long.

841
00:44:02,239 --> 00:44:05,106
l think her and her mother
are missing the listening gene.

842
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:06,298
Brock Houseman.

843
00:44:07,678 --> 00:44:09,441
Yes, ma'am,
thanks for calling me back.

844
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:11,512
Look, l was hoping
we could talk about--

845
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:14,408
ls that right?

846
00:44:14,618 --> 00:44:17,382
No, no, l understand.
l'm just sorry to hear that.

847
00:44:17,855 --> 00:44:19,220
l will let him know.

848
00:44:19,423 --> 00:44:20,515
Okay, bye.

849
00:44:22,059 --> 00:44:23,253
Darius' mom.

850
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:26,429
She said Darnell still won't let the boy
back on the team.

851
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:29,724
What's he trying to do?
Guarantee his son ends up like him?

852
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:33,993
-What's Julie doing here?
-l never thought they'd show up.

853
00:44:34,204 --> 00:44:36,695
Well, l'm glad she did.
l'm feeling a little leg cramp.

854
00:44:36,907 --> 00:44:39,603
-Maybe she could rub it out.
-See, there you go.

855
00:44:40,477 --> 00:44:42,308
-All right, this is Bryson.
-Hey, Bryson.

856
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:45,505
-He's gonna be having fun with us.
-Oh, what's cracking, y'all?

857
00:44:46,116 --> 00:44:48,346
Somebody be watching
too much BET.

858
00:44:48,552 --> 00:44:51,919
-All right, come on.
-That's enough. Hit the field, let's go.

859
00:44:54,291 --> 00:44:55,918
-Nice swing.
-That's okay, Bryson.

860
00:44:56,126 --> 00:44:59,493
Keep your eye on the ball, give me
a swing, make contact. You got it.

861
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:01,130
Here we go.

862
00:45:03,133 --> 00:45:06,660
Yo, coach, my little sister could hit
that pitch and she's blind in one eye.

863
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:09,031
Oh, come on,
my grandma can hit that.

864
00:45:09,239 --> 00:45:11,230
-Bryson, come here.
-My goodness, you suck.

865
00:45:11,442 --> 00:45:13,239
Get off the field, man.

866
00:45:14,211 --> 00:45:17,510
Listen, it's okay, all right?
l don't want you to listen to any of that.

867
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:18,704
-You hear me?
-Yeah.

868
00:45:18,916 --> 00:45:22,443
Now, l want you to go back up there.
l want it just to be you and the ball.

869
00:45:23,087 --> 00:45:24,179
-Okay.
-You got that?

870
00:45:24,388 --> 00:45:26,720
-Let's go, buddy, here we go.
-Okay.

871
00:45:26,924 --> 00:45:28,414
-Let's go, come on.
-Here we go.

872
00:45:52,850 --> 00:45:54,374
See that?

873
00:45:56,453 --> 00:45:58,785
Good job, Bryson, good job.

874
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:05,485
Nice hit, dog.

875
00:46:11,401 --> 00:46:13,232
Good job, Bryson.

876
00:46:13,570 --> 00:46:14,559
Good job.

877
00:46:14,772 --> 00:46:18,833
Hey, Julie, l wanted to give you
my contact info.

878
00:46:19,042 --> 00:46:22,478
You know, just in case Bryson ever
wants to come back to practice again.

879
00:46:22,679 --> 00:46:24,977
-Or when your car breaks down.
-Thanks.

880
00:46:25,182 --> 00:46:26,308
Or dinner.

881
00:46:26,817 --> 00:46:28,375
-Dinner, okay.
-Okay, no.

882
00:46:28,585 --> 00:46:31,076
-Coffee, doesn't have to be dinner.
-No, it's not that.

883
00:46:31,288 --> 00:46:35,019
lt's just l probably
should just stop you right there.

884
00:46:35,225 --> 00:46:37,693
l feel like l've dated you before.

885
00:46:37,895 --> 00:46:40,125
No, no, no,
l would have remembered that.

886
00:46:40,330 --> 00:46:43,458
No, not you, your type, and l....

887
00:46:43,834 --> 00:46:44,823
l get it, okay.

888
00:46:45,035 --> 00:46:47,003
You just wanna cut
past the foreplay.

889
00:46:47,204 --> 00:46:49,798
-lt's okay.
-Okay, l guess, l--

890
00:46:50,007 --> 00:46:51,406
No, l know what you mean.

891
00:46:51,608 --> 00:46:54,236
No offense, because l really
appreciate you fixing my car.

892
00:46:54,444 --> 00:46:56,674
But l just don't have the time
or the energy.

893
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:58,404
You know, dating's not my thing.

894
00:46:58,615 --> 00:47:00,173
My kid's my thing.

895
00:47:00,384 --> 00:47:03,683
So if l were to get
into a relationship...

896
00:47:03,887 --> 00:47:07,118
...it would have to be with someone
who could be a potential husband...

897
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:11,260
...and a father to my son, and
l'm pretty sure that's not your thing.

898
00:47:11,461 --> 00:47:12,894
No, l....

899
00:47:13,096 --> 00:47:15,894
-Well, l could do that.
-You could?

900
00:47:16,099 --> 00:47:17,361
-Sure.
-Okay.

901
00:47:17,568 --> 00:47:19,502
Bryson, grab your bag. We gotta go.

902
00:47:19,703 --> 00:47:21,603
Okay.

903
00:47:21,905 --> 00:47:23,930
You're not gonna stalk me now,
are you?

904
00:47:24,141 --> 00:47:27,474
-Not unless you want me to.
-l think l'll take a pass on that.

905
00:47:28,011 --> 00:47:30,070
l'm really glad
we had this conversation.

906
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:31,474
Cleared everything up.

907
00:47:31,882 --> 00:47:32,871
Call me, okay?

908
00:47:33,083 --> 00:47:36,109
-Good job out there today.
-Bye, thanks, coach.

909
00:47:37,721 --> 00:47:40,554
She will not leave me alone.

910
00:47:40,757 --> 00:47:44,056
-l'm telling you, she wants me.
-Yeah, l could see it all over her face.

911
00:47:44,261 --> 00:47:45,250
-Can you?
-Yeah.

912
00:47:45,462 --> 00:47:47,396
Really?
l don't know what l'm gonna do.

913
00:48:15,459 --> 00:48:17,359
College boy,
what the hell you want?

914
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:21,998
Got a beef with me, let's do it. Don't
kill your son's future because of it.

915
00:48:22,199 --> 00:48:24,133
What l do with my son,
that's my business.

916
00:48:24,334 --> 00:48:27,792
l'm making it my business. Knock
that victim chip off your shoulder.

917
00:48:28,005 --> 00:48:29,836
Or Darius is gonna end up
just like you.

918
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:32,099
Your punk ass would know
all about that too.

919
00:48:32,309 --> 00:48:36,405
When are you gonna stop blaming the
world for punching my college ticket?

920
00:48:36,613 --> 00:48:38,581
Didn't nobody force you
to sling that crack.

921
00:48:38,782 --> 00:48:41,683
What l do with my son,
it's my son, it's my business.

922
00:48:41,885 --> 00:48:44,479
Well, give your son an opportunity.

923
00:48:47,391 --> 00:48:49,256
Hey, and the next time
you come up here...

924
00:48:49,459 --> 00:48:51,654
...you better come up here strapped.

925
00:48:54,197 --> 00:48:56,529
Talking that beef garbage.

926
00:48:59,703 --> 00:49:02,638
Carmen, I've been looking
for two days for you.

927
00:49:02,973 --> 00:49:04,099
For two days, Carmencita.

928
00:49:04,308 --> 00:49:06,572
I inquired at the factory,
and you were absent.

929
00:49:06,777 --> 00:49:09,507
Why do we have to watch this?
Can't we watch something else?

930
00:49:09,713 --> 00:49:12,511
Girl, shut up, you know
we ain't changing this channel.

931
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:15,081
Hello?

932
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:18,847
Yeah, hold on a second.

933
00:49:19,056 --> 00:49:20,785
To the magi-- Magistrate.

934
00:49:20,991 --> 00:49:22,322
To the magistrate?

935
00:49:22,526 --> 00:49:24,585
He'll send me to prison.
I can't go to prison.

936
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:27,696
It's just he died in the prison.
And I had no money to survive--

937
00:49:27,898 --> 00:49:30,594
Coach, hey, can you come
to my swim meet Saturday...

938
00:49:30,801 --> 00:49:32,325
...so l can show you my stuff?

939
00:49:33,337 --> 00:49:36,431
lt would have to be in the afternoon.
We have a game in the morning.

940
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:38,471
Okay, cool, l'll see you at the pool.

941
00:49:38,675 --> 00:49:40,040
Give me that phone.

942
00:49:40,243 --> 00:49:42,803
l'm so sorry, honestly,
and if it's too much pressure--

943
00:49:43,013 --> 00:49:44,446
No, no, look, it's no problem.

944
00:49:44,648 --> 00:49:45,672
Tell him l'll be there.

945
00:49:45,882 --> 00:49:47,543
Oh, I know. Believe me, I know.

946
00:49:48,352 --> 00:49:50,479
-Are you seeing this?
-What?

947
00:49:50,988 --> 00:49:54,355
Since when he gotta go outside
to answer a phone call?

948
00:49:54,558 --> 00:49:57,550
I'm not afraid of hard work.
I'm a good, honest, working girl.

949
00:49:57,761 --> 00:49:59,251
But who would take care of me--?

950
00:49:59,463 --> 00:50:02,193
Honey, l spent too many years
with your raggedy-ass daddy...

951
00:50:02,399 --> 00:50:04,162
...to know when something's wrong.

952
00:50:08,505 --> 00:50:09,631
See this?

953
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:12,240
These movies had romance.

954
00:50:12,442 --> 00:50:14,307
Good movies, good writing.

955
00:50:14,511 --> 00:50:19,244
I'm ready to go now, soldier.
Please take me away from here.

956
00:50:46,410 --> 00:50:49,345
-This scares me, David.
-What?

957
00:50:49,546 --> 00:50:51,309
This.

958
00:50:52,616 --> 00:50:55,585
The silence between us.

959
00:50:57,921 --> 00:51:00,151
l was thinking,
with our anniversary coming up...

960
00:51:00,357 --> 00:51:03,986
...maybe we should just get away
for the weekend, you know?

961
00:51:04,194 --> 00:51:07,186
Because l know it's been stressful
since the accident, l know.

962
00:51:07,397 --> 00:51:09,092
lt's been a lot longer than that.

963
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:14,261
Okay, that's fair.

964
00:51:17,641 --> 00:51:22,169
l've never felt
some of the feelings l'm feeling...

965
00:51:22,379 --> 00:51:24,779
...and l just don't know
how to deal with them.

966
00:51:25,348 --> 00:51:28,249
l guess what scares me the most
is you pulling away like this...

967
00:51:28,452 --> 00:51:31,046
...because it's not like you, David.

968
00:51:35,826 --> 00:51:38,386
Can we talk
to someone about it, please?

969
00:51:40,464 --> 00:51:42,227
lf that's what you want.

970
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:08,289
Since the accident, l know l've been
a little difficult to get along with.

971
00:52:08,492 --> 00:52:11,825
l know that.
And l've been depressed, you know?

972
00:52:12,028 --> 00:52:15,464
And that should be understandable.
l'm getting over a major injury.

973
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:19,230
But David's pulling away
and l don't know why.

974
00:52:19,436 --> 00:52:24,100
l-- l feel like he's doing it on purpose.
Like l've done something.

975
00:52:24,307 --> 00:52:27,333
Like he's paying me back for
something l don't even know l've done.

976
00:52:27,544 --> 00:52:32,709
And then he spends all of his time with
these boys, this Little League team.

977
00:52:32,916 --> 00:52:35,316
And that's time he could be
spending with me at home.

978
00:52:35,519 --> 00:52:37,919
Working on our marriage.

979
00:52:38,388 --> 00:52:43,257
Dave, what do you wanna say
to Clarice right now?

980
00:52:43,727 --> 00:52:44,887
l mean, what's the point?

981
00:52:45,095 --> 00:52:47,529
You heard her.
She has everything figured out, so....

982
00:52:47,731 --> 00:52:50,165
You see what l mean?
This attitude is--

983
00:52:50,367 --> 00:52:53,393
lt makes my skin crawl
because that's not us, bishop.

984
00:52:53,603 --> 00:52:56,629
We used to talk things through.
We talked about everything--

985
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:59,400
No, no, we never used to
talk about everything, okay?

986
00:52:59,609 --> 00:53:01,042
You used to do all the talking.

987
00:53:01,244 --> 00:53:03,542
l used to sit,
listen to her and her mother cackle.

988
00:53:03,747 --> 00:53:06,045
Cac-- He has no respect
for my mother.

989
00:53:06,249 --> 00:53:07,716
-Let's just--
-Mama loves you.

990
00:53:07,918 --> 00:53:10,011
No, no, she doesn't love me,
she tolerates me.

991
00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:12,586
Because she loves you.
But l'm cool with that.

992
00:53:12,789 --> 00:53:15,587
-Can't believe you just sit up in this--
-Dave, Clarice.

993
00:53:17,694 --> 00:53:19,184
Why do you say that, Dave?

994
00:53:20,096 --> 00:53:22,155
Well, the truth of the matter,
bishop...

995
00:53:22,365 --> 00:53:27,530
...is that l feel like
l'm just visiting this marriage.

996
00:53:28,872 --> 00:53:29,930
See? See?

997
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:32,904
l mean, nothing l ever do,
nothing l ever say is ever enough.

998
00:53:33,109 --> 00:53:34,201
-Oh, God.
-That's honest.

999
00:53:34,411 --> 00:53:37,539
-Please, that's David being dramatic.
-Clarice.

1000
00:53:37,747 --> 00:53:39,942
-You should get an award for that one.
-Clarice.

1001
00:53:41,284 --> 00:53:44,014
What irks you about Dave
coaching those Little Leaguers?

1002
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:46,689
He's never home, bishop.
You know?

1003
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:50,417
He's always with them.
He's always with those boys.

1004
00:53:50,627 --> 00:53:52,959
That's all he cares about.

1005
00:53:53,163 --> 00:53:57,395
You mean like what a father
would like to do if he had a son?

1006
00:53:57,601 --> 00:53:58,727
Maybe.

1007
00:53:58,935 --> 00:54:03,634
-But he knows we can't afford children.
-No, we can afford kids, okay?

1008
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:07,105
lf someone didn't live beyond
their means, we could afford kids.

1009
00:54:07,310 --> 00:54:08,641
Please, David.

1010
00:54:09,546 --> 00:54:11,878
Look at us, look at us.

1011
00:54:12,082 --> 00:54:16,382
Trying to fix our marriage. Do you
really think a baby is gonna help?

1012
00:54:16,586 --> 00:54:19,714
-l used to.
-That's enough.

1013
00:54:19,923 --> 00:54:21,982
Are you finished?

1014
00:54:23,827 --> 00:54:26,728
Do the two of you remember
how I told you on your wedding day...

1015
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:29,558
...how hard life can be?

1016
00:54:30,667 --> 00:54:32,225
Well, that three-stranded cord...

1017
00:54:32,435 --> 00:54:36,804
...I wrapped around your shoulders
that day, will always be there.

1018
00:54:37,641 --> 00:54:40,474
Unless, of course,
you've chosen to remove it.

1019
00:55:07,504 --> 00:55:09,472
Does that feel good?

1020
00:55:24,454 --> 00:55:26,854
Dave.

1021
00:55:41,004 --> 00:55:42,995
Are you okay?

1022
00:55:43,707 --> 00:55:45,174
You were moaning.

1023
00:55:48,345 --> 00:55:50,506
Yeah, l was....

1024
00:55:52,148 --> 00:55:54,480
l'm gonna get a drink of water.

1025
00:56:17,874 --> 00:56:19,466
l guess that makes it ours.

1026
00:56:19,676 --> 00:56:22,474
-Yes.
-Oh, l love it, Clarice.

1027
00:56:22,679 --> 00:56:25,773
And you managed to keep it alive
while we made up our minds.

1028
00:56:25,982 --> 00:56:29,315
Well, actually it was Michelle here
who kept it alive...

1029
00:56:29,519 --> 00:56:31,953
...and that's why she's gonna share
in the commission.

1030
00:56:32,422 --> 00:56:33,514
-Well, thank you.
-Okay.

1031
00:56:33,723 --> 00:56:36,123
-l've got to get to the courthouse.
-No, you don't.

1032
00:56:36,326 --> 00:56:39,193
You first have to see new tile samples
for the master bathroom.

1033
00:56:39,396 --> 00:56:41,489
l got a full caseload.
Court won't wait for me.

1034
00:56:41,698 --> 00:56:43,859
The tile samples.

1035
00:56:46,569 --> 00:56:48,400
Yes.

1036
00:56:50,607 --> 00:56:52,097
Yes.

1037
00:56:54,911 --> 00:56:56,606
Okay, Clarice, what's wrong?

1038
00:56:56,813 --> 00:56:59,680
We just closed one
of the biggest deals of your life...

1039
00:56:59,883 --> 00:57:02,408
...and you walking around
like somebody stole your bike.

1040
00:57:02,619 --> 00:57:04,644
-What's going on?
-Nothing.

1041
00:57:04,854 --> 00:57:06,287
-l'm fine.
-Nothing, yes, it is.

1042
00:57:06,489 --> 00:57:08,218
Tell me, come on now.

1043
00:57:08,425 --> 00:57:09,858
This is me, tell it.

1044
00:57:10,059 --> 00:57:12,721
lt's-- l'm just having
one of those days, okay?

1045
00:57:12,929 --> 00:57:14,419
Just....

1046
00:57:15,098 --> 00:57:19,592
Do not make me go Oprah on you,
because l will.

1047
00:57:23,006 --> 00:57:25,338
l think David's having an affair.

1048
00:57:26,443 --> 00:57:28,206
-What?
-Yes.

1049
00:57:28,411 --> 00:57:30,174
Oh, honey, are you sure?

1050
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:33,281
Yes, Michelle.
l can see it in his eyes.

1051
00:57:34,350 --> 00:57:37,114
lt's always in the eyes, ain't it?

1052
00:57:38,087 --> 00:57:40,146
And it's my physical therapist.

1053
00:57:40,356 --> 00:57:42,620
What?
That skinny little white thing?

1054
00:57:43,092 --> 00:57:44,491
-lt's Julie Sawyer.
-Okay.

1055
00:57:44,694 --> 00:57:46,389
Oh, girl. What?

1056
00:57:46,596 --> 00:57:49,326
You got to go over there
and open up a good old can...

1057
00:57:49,532 --> 00:57:51,659
...of soul-sister power
on her narrow behind.

1058
00:57:51,868 --> 00:57:54,666
l can't do that.
l don't have any real proof.

1059
00:57:55,271 --> 00:57:57,705
We got to go over there
and snatch her.

1060
00:57:57,907 --> 00:58:00,398
Michelle, l can't do that.

1061
00:58:00,610 --> 00:58:03,010
Snatch her by her hair...

1062
00:58:03,213 --> 00:58:08,651
...and squeeze until that heifer tell us
everything we wanna know, okay?

1063
00:58:08,852 --> 00:58:10,911
You want me to do it?

1064
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:12,382
Look at me, look at me.

1065
00:58:13,223 --> 00:58:16,386
Don't go all
Waiting to Exhale on me.

1066
00:58:16,593 --> 00:58:18,322
Dave is too good a man
for you to lose.

1067
00:58:18,528 --> 00:58:21,224
And you don't want
to do something all crazy...

1068
00:58:21,431 --> 00:58:22,728
...that you can't take back.

1069
00:58:22,932 --> 00:58:25,400
Now, you take that from me. l know.

1070
00:58:25,602 --> 00:58:28,002
Don't tell me Todd is cheating too.

1071
00:58:30,707 --> 00:58:31,731
l did the cheating.

1072
00:58:31,941 --> 00:58:33,636
-What?
-l know.

1073
00:58:33,843 --> 00:58:35,572
Don't look at me like that, l know.

1074
00:58:35,778 --> 00:58:39,009
How--?
How was he able to forgive you?

1075
00:58:40,016 --> 00:58:44,316
lt was not easy, okay?
lt took a long time.

1076
00:58:44,521 --> 00:58:48,548
But he forgave me, after all that.

1077
00:58:48,758 --> 00:58:52,660
And l will never sacrifice
his heart like that again.

1078
00:58:53,663 --> 00:58:55,528
Yeah, well,
that's good for you guys...

1079
00:58:55,732 --> 00:59:00,863
...but l just don't think
l have it in me to do that.

1080
00:59:01,070 --> 00:59:03,538
Yes, you do.

1081
00:59:04,474 --> 00:59:07,534
Now, are you sure you don't want me
to go snatch the white girl?

1082
00:59:07,744 --> 00:59:08,870
Why are you so crazy?

1083
00:59:09,078 --> 00:59:11,569
l'm just saying.
lt'll make you feel better.

1084
00:59:11,781 --> 00:59:16,548
-No, it'll make you feel better.
-Yes, yes, it will make me feel better.

1085
00:59:16,753 --> 00:59:18,880
Oh, my friend.

1086
00:59:19,088 --> 00:59:22,319
-l am so sorry.
-Me too.

1087
00:59:22,525 --> 00:59:24,959
Maybe we should snatch Dave too.

1088
00:59:25,161 --> 00:59:27,891
Just do a drive-by snatching,
and snatch everybody.

1089
00:59:33,770 --> 00:59:35,863
You can do it.

1090
00:59:44,447 --> 00:59:46,039
-lt's all right.
-Way to go for it.

1091
00:59:46,616 --> 00:59:48,481
Good job, Bryson.

1092
00:59:48,985 --> 00:59:52,079
Let me tell you something, Bryson.
You were a beast up in that pool.

1093
00:59:52,288 --> 00:59:55,189
-Thanks, coach.
-l can't wait to come to another meet.

1094
00:59:55,391 --> 00:59:58,724
Well, l'm here all weekend if l keep
winning. The finals are tomorrow.

1095
00:59:58,928 --> 01:00:00,623
Hey, Bryson, wait up.

1096
01:00:01,331 --> 01:00:03,959
There is a rep here
from the Junior Olympics.

1097
01:00:04,167 --> 01:00:05,566
And l want you to meet him.

1098
01:00:06,069 --> 01:00:08,367
-Are you serious?
-You're on your way, young man.

1099
01:00:08,571 --> 01:00:11,404
Okay, well, go.
We'll be out here waiting for you.

1100
01:00:11,608 --> 01:00:12,905
Okay.

1101
01:00:13,109 --> 01:00:14,633
Hey, listen, thank you so much...

1102
01:00:14,844 --> 01:00:17,312
...for taking the time
to come out here today and--

1103
01:00:17,513 --> 01:00:19,879
l mean, it really means
the world to both of us.

1104
01:00:20,083 --> 01:00:22,210
Hey, a deal's a deal, right?

1105
01:00:24,854 --> 01:00:26,378
Hey, Dave?

1106
01:00:26,789 --> 01:00:28,757
Don't take this
the wrong way or anything...

1107
01:00:28,958 --> 01:00:32,621
...but we single girls
are experts at a few things.

1108
01:00:32,829 --> 01:00:35,491
-Like what?
-Like good men.

1109
01:00:36,399 --> 01:00:40,165
l was telling Clarice just the other day
about how all the guys like you...

1110
01:00:40,370 --> 01:00:43,828
...are already taken
and that she's a very lucky woman.

1111
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:45,598
Thanks.

1112
01:00:48,544 --> 01:00:49,670
Can l ask you a question?

1113
01:00:50,380 --> 01:00:52,678
l saw your college photo
at the house.

1114
01:00:52,882 --> 01:00:55,180
What happened
to your baseball career?

1115
01:00:55,818 --> 01:00:58,048
Anterior cruciate ligament
happened to my career.

1116
01:00:58,254 --> 01:01:00,017
-Oh, man.
-Yeah.

1117
01:01:00,723 --> 01:01:02,122
l was sliding into home plate.

1118
01:01:02,325 --> 01:01:04,953
My knee went one way
and my body went the other.

1119
01:01:05,628 --> 01:01:08,188
Along with my dreams
of making it into the big leagues.

1120
01:01:08,398 --> 01:01:12,198
Well, at least you're passing those
dreams on to those Little Leaguers.

1121
01:01:12,402 --> 01:01:14,427
Yeah, somebody's
got to take care of them.

1122
01:01:14,637 --> 01:01:16,867
-And that you do.
-That l do.

1123
01:01:17,707 --> 01:01:19,174
And who takes care of you?

1124
01:01:22,512 --> 01:01:23,706
Hello, hello.

1125
01:01:23,913 --> 01:01:25,710
-Hey.
-Hey.

1126
01:01:25,915 --> 01:01:28,577
-What are you doing here?
-l can ask you the same question.

1127
01:01:28,785 --> 01:01:30,309
l was just bringing flowers.

1128
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:33,546
l never brought flowers before
in my entire life, just so you know.

1129
01:01:33,756 --> 01:01:35,724
And they aren't for you,
my married friend.

1130
01:01:35,925 --> 01:01:37,586
Yeah, well, l didn't think so.

1131
01:01:37,794 --> 01:01:41,059
Okay, l think l'm gonna go
check on the boys inside.

1132
01:01:44,033 --> 01:01:45,625
Oh, they're beautiful.

1133
01:01:45,835 --> 01:01:48,565
Hey, these flowers don't mean
l'm stalking you.

1134
01:01:49,138 --> 01:01:50,605
No, they're beautiful. Yeah.

1135
01:01:50,807 --> 01:01:54,436
-We had a conversation.
-Okey-doke.

1136
01:01:56,045 --> 01:01:58,878
Okay, that's weird.

1137
01:01:59,882 --> 01:02:04,182
Clearly l don't have a chance with this
girl, which is deeply baffling to me.

1138
01:02:04,987 --> 01:02:07,581
So seriously, man.

1139
01:02:08,257 --> 01:02:10,782
-What are you doing here?
-What am l doing here?

1140
01:02:10,993 --> 01:02:13,518
You don't think l see
what's going on here?

1141
01:02:14,297 --> 01:02:17,460
You got everything a man could want.
A gorgeous wife, beautiful home.

1142
01:02:17,667 --> 01:02:20,397
And you think that
that makes it all good for me?

1143
01:02:21,838 --> 01:02:24,102
l just don't want to see you
screw up your life.

1144
01:02:24,307 --> 01:02:27,868
Too late for that.
My life's already screwed up.

1145
01:02:30,847 --> 01:02:32,439
Dave.

1146
01:02:33,483 --> 01:02:34,780
Who takes care of me?

1147
01:02:37,019 --> 01:02:40,546
-Hey, Dave.
-That's a damn good question.

1148
01:02:46,662 --> 01:02:49,631
A question
I didn't have an answer for.

1149
01:02:59,308 --> 01:03:00,798
Hi.

1150
01:03:02,211 --> 01:03:03,940
You didn't notice the candles?

1151
01:03:07,250 --> 01:03:08,911
-Reesie, l--
-Come on, baby.

1152
01:03:09,118 --> 01:03:11,279
You remember the candles.

1153
01:03:11,487 --> 01:03:14,786
When we first got married,
they were always my signal...

1154
01:03:14,991 --> 01:03:17,926
...to let you know
l was gonna put something on you.

1155
01:03:20,096 --> 01:03:21,188
l know.

1156
01:03:22,131 --> 01:03:26,830
l know it's been a long time
since l lit my candles for you, l....

1157
01:03:28,738 --> 01:03:29,898
You don't have to do this.

1158
01:03:30,106 --> 01:03:32,700
Baby, we need this.

1159
01:03:34,043 --> 01:03:37,069
l sent Mama on a long errand,
so she won't be back for a long time.

1160
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:40,113
Come here, please.

1161
01:03:49,859 --> 01:03:52,020
Like you said,
it's time for us to get back...

1162
01:03:52,228 --> 01:03:54,423
...to the loving part of our marriage.

1163
01:03:54,630 --> 01:03:58,828
-Oh, baby, l want you so bad.
-Stop.

1164
01:04:10,513 --> 01:04:13,380
-Are you sleeping with her?
-What?

1165
01:04:14,283 --> 01:04:15,375
l'm not stupid, David.

1166
01:04:15,585 --> 01:04:18,520
-Are you sleeping with Julie?
-No, l'm not sleeping with her.

1167
01:04:19,222 --> 01:04:21,918
Well, then, what is it? What--?

1168
01:04:22,124 --> 01:04:25,218
Since when have you had
to take phone calls outside?

1169
01:04:25,428 --> 01:04:27,896
What are all
the phone calls about, anyway?

1170
01:04:28,097 --> 01:04:30,725
David, what's happening?
Tell me the truth.

1171
01:04:30,933 --> 01:04:34,266
Things haven't been right between us
and l think we both know that.

1172
01:04:34,470 --> 01:04:36,233
l know that.

1173
01:04:38,674 --> 01:04:40,164
So l'm not gonna lie to you.

1174
01:04:43,179 --> 01:04:46,171
l do have some feelings for her.

1175
01:04:51,954 --> 01:04:53,785
That's worse.

1176
01:04:54,624 --> 01:04:57,286
She's taken your heart from me?

1177
01:05:02,231 --> 01:05:04,461
So, what do you want me to do?

1178
01:05:06,435 --> 01:05:08,596
l don't know, David.

1179
01:05:26,022 --> 01:05:28,490
-Clarice.
-How could you, Julie?

1180
01:05:28,691 --> 01:05:31,319
-What?
-How could you betray me like this?

1181
01:05:31,527 --> 01:05:33,654
-Betray you, what--?
-l respected you.

1182
01:05:33,863 --> 01:05:35,023
l thought we were friends.

1183
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:38,860
Okay, l gotta stop you right there
if this is what l think it's about.

1184
01:05:39,068 --> 01:05:41,593
Dave and l are friends.
Just like you and l are friends.

1185
01:05:41,804 --> 01:05:43,965
Nothing more, nothing less.
We're just friends.

1186
01:05:44,173 --> 01:05:47,665
Girl, as much as l would like
to snatch you right now...

1187
01:05:47,877 --> 01:05:49,504
...l'm not gonna do that.

1188
01:05:49,712 --> 01:05:51,339
l'm gonna rise above this.

1189
01:05:52,348 --> 01:05:55,340
But let me make myself very clear.

1190
01:05:55,551 --> 01:05:58,179
Stay the hell away
from my husband.

1191
01:05:59,422 --> 01:06:01,515
You wanna blame someone
for your problems?

1192
01:06:01,724 --> 01:06:03,885
You didn't need to leave
your doorstep to do it.

1193
01:06:04,093 --> 01:06:06,118
And you certainly don't need
to come to mine.

1194
01:06:06,329 --> 01:06:07,796
Oh, girl.

1195
01:06:07,997 --> 01:06:11,364
ln case you didn't hear me
the first time...

1196
01:06:11,567 --> 01:06:15,867
...stay away from my man.

1197
01:07:02,885 --> 01:07:04,318
Yeah.

1198
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:06,784
-Yeah, come on.
-Here we go.

1199
01:07:08,024 --> 01:07:09,889
Take your marks.

1200
01:07:26,409 --> 01:07:29,674
-Come on.
-Kick, kick, kick.

1201
01:08:06,649 --> 01:08:08,617
Go, Bryson!

1202
01:08:08,818 --> 01:08:11,548
Come on, Bryson! Keep pushing!

1203
01:08:32,675 --> 01:08:34,609
-Come on, Bryson!
-Go!

1204
01:08:39,381 --> 01:08:41,076
Oh, my God!

1205
01:08:43,119 --> 01:08:44,347
Oh, my God!

1206
01:08:45,521 --> 01:08:48,718
Oh, he's done it! Oh, my God!

1207
01:09:01,137 --> 01:09:02,434
Why don't we say it's a draw?

1208
01:09:12,414 --> 01:09:15,713
Let me ask you this, man to man.
Ain't nobody in here but me and you.

1209
01:09:19,188 --> 01:09:22,624
Who gets that baseball scholarship
if we back in the day?

1210
01:09:26,328 --> 01:09:27,386
You do.

1211
01:09:28,664 --> 01:09:30,791
But l was a better athlete.

1212
01:09:31,634 --> 01:09:32,999
Right.

1213
01:09:34,970 --> 01:09:37,666
So you think all the hell
l've been through was my fault.

1214
01:09:37,873 --> 01:09:40,467
Man, everybody got problems.

1215
01:09:40,676 --> 01:09:42,974
See, you just don't know
how good you got it.

1216
01:09:43,179 --> 01:09:45,739
You talking about Darius, right?

1217
01:09:45,948 --> 01:09:50,817
l'd trade that scholarship and
everything l had for a son like Darius.

1218
01:10:16,579 --> 01:10:17,876
Oh, hell, no.

1219
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:20,173
Yeah, that's right. That's right.

1220
01:10:20,382 --> 01:10:21,610
We putting you out of here.

1221
01:10:21,817 --> 01:10:24,047
And don't think Clarice
is gonna change her mind.

1222
01:10:24,253 --> 01:10:25,686
What you doing, you old woman?

1223
01:10:25,888 --> 01:10:28,413
-Old? Oh, no, hell, no.
-Mama, please!

1224
01:10:28,624 --> 01:10:30,251
No, no, no, let her talk.

1225
01:10:30,459 --> 01:10:32,950
She's always had an equal vote.
Why change it now?

1226
01:10:33,162 --> 01:10:34,925
What is wrong with you?

1227
01:10:35,130 --> 01:10:38,122
You got this beautiful
black queen right here.

1228
01:10:38,334 --> 01:10:40,234
What in your mind
makes you think...

1229
01:10:40,436 --> 01:10:42,301
...you gotta go out
and get a white woman?

1230
01:10:42,504 --> 01:10:44,062
Shut up
and mind your own business.

1231
01:10:44,273 --> 01:10:46,503
-David.
-No.

1232
01:10:47,142 --> 01:10:51,044
He been living high on the hog
leeching off your money for years.

1233
01:10:51,247 --> 01:10:53,579
lt's time you got his black ass
out of here.

1234
01:10:53,782 --> 01:10:56,148
She more of a man
than you'll ever be.

1235
01:10:57,052 --> 01:10:59,748
So you just gonna stand there
and let her say that to me?

1236
01:11:01,690 --> 01:11:03,351
Clarice.

1237
01:11:03,559 --> 01:11:07,791
You are just gonna stand there
and let her say that to me?

1238
01:11:10,299 --> 01:11:14,360
Well, then you're right.
lt is time for me to get out of here.

1239
01:11:14,570 --> 01:11:16,731
Because l don't give
a damn about this house...

1240
01:11:16,939 --> 01:11:20,204
...your money or this marriage.

1241
01:11:20,676 --> 01:11:21,665
l'm done.

1242
01:11:21,877 --> 01:11:23,310
Dave.

1243
01:11:24,847 --> 01:11:25,836
Hey, where you been?

1244
01:11:26,048 --> 01:11:28,915
l've been trying to call your cell.
There was an accident.

1245
01:11:29,118 --> 01:11:30,449
-lt's Bryson.
-What happened?

1246
01:11:30,653 --> 01:11:32,678
l don't know,
he went into the wall too hard.

1247
01:11:32,888 --> 01:11:36,517
They rushed him to the hospital.
lt's bad, man, really bad.

1248
01:11:40,462 --> 01:11:41,588
Come on, l'll drive.

1249
01:11:41,797 --> 01:11:44,527
-l should go.
-You ain't going nowhere.

1250
01:11:44,733 --> 01:11:46,667
Go on in the house.

1251
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:53,239
Coach.

1252
01:12:00,282 --> 01:12:02,011
Please, what are you doing?

1253
01:12:02,217 --> 01:12:03,980
No, no, no. Please, no.

1254
01:12:04,186 --> 01:12:06,746
No, no.

1255
01:12:07,923 --> 01:12:10,084
Oh, please, God.

1256
01:12:40,489 --> 01:12:42,582
She's all alone.

1257
01:12:43,525 --> 01:12:46,892
l don't think she has anyone
to help her through this.

1258
01:12:47,996 --> 01:12:49,759
She has us.

1259
01:12:58,707 --> 01:13:02,768
''The Lord is my shepherd.
l shall not want.

1260
01:13:03,379 --> 01:13:06,007
He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures.

1261
01:13:06,215 --> 01:13:08,945
He leadeth me
beside the still waters.

1262
01:13:09,151 --> 01:13:11,449
He restoreth my soul.

1263
01:13:12,321 --> 01:13:17,190
He leadeth me in the paths
of righteousness for his name's sake.

1264
01:13:17,393 --> 01:13:20,021
Though l walk through
the valley of the shadow of death...

1265
01:13:20,229 --> 01:13:24,222
...l will fear no evil,
for thou art with me.

1266
01:13:24,433 --> 01:13:28,164
Thy rod and Thy staff,
they comfort me.

1267
01:13:28,971 --> 01:13:32,236
Thou preparest a table before me
in the presence of mine enemies.

1268
01:13:32,441 --> 01:13:35,706
Thou anointest my head with oil.''

1269
01:14:23,692 --> 01:14:26,183
''My cup runneth over.

1270
01:14:26,929 --> 01:14:32,697
Surely goodness and mercy
shall follow me all the days of my life.

1271
01:14:32,901 --> 01:14:38,806
And l will dwell in the house
of the Lord forever.'' Amen.

1272
01:15:23,986 --> 01:15:27,683
Clarice, be honest with me.

1273
01:15:29,791 --> 01:15:32,851
ln the last meeting
l had with you and Dave...

1274
01:15:33,061 --> 01:15:35,359
...l asked you
a very important question.

1275
01:15:36,431 --> 01:15:37,762
Yeah.

1276
01:15:39,167 --> 01:15:43,627
Has God been
the third strand in that cord...

1277
01:15:43,839 --> 01:15:47,832
...l wrapped around
your shoulders all those years ago?

1278
01:15:49,645 --> 01:15:50,976
No.

1279
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:56,847
Well, without that third strand...

1280
01:15:57,719 --> 01:16:00,847
...you find yourself
sitting here alone.

1281
01:16:04,393 --> 01:16:07,829
Your mother is a good woman.

1282
01:16:08,830 --> 01:16:15,235
But because you listened to her
in matters of your marriage...

1283
01:16:16,672 --> 01:16:21,006
...that acorn hasn't fallen
too far from the tree.

1284
01:16:23,078 --> 01:16:25,808
Now, l got to go bury this child.

1285
01:16:27,316 --> 01:16:29,250
But, Clarice...

1286
01:16:31,386 --> 01:16:36,881
...you're in the right place
at the right time.

1287
01:16:51,673 --> 01:16:53,197
When I drive through this city...

1288
01:16:53,408 --> 01:16:56,468
...and hear the sounds of sirens
and alarms going off...

1289
01:16:56,678 --> 01:17:00,614
...I see the looks of panic
on the faces of people I don't know.

1290
01:17:01,116 --> 01:17:04,677
I realize how afraid we all are
in this world.

1291
01:17:05,420 --> 01:17:10,255
Life is so unpredictable, fragile.

1292
01:17:10,459 --> 01:17:14,987
We're only alive one breath,
one heartbeat at a time.

1293
01:17:34,950 --> 01:17:37,680
And so when death comes
to one of us...

1294
01:17:37,886 --> 01:17:39,945
...it comes to all of us.

1295
01:17:40,155 --> 01:17:43,522
Because it's the one thing
we all have in common.

1296
01:17:43,725 --> 01:17:48,788
Sooner or later,
it's the one place we're all headed.

1297
01:18:11,053 --> 01:18:12,714
And even though
some of us believe...

1298
01:18:12,921 --> 01:18:17,688
...that life doesn't end
on this side of the grave...

1299
01:18:17,893 --> 01:18:23,058
...our grief drives us to hunger
for a human touch.

1300
01:18:41,950 --> 01:18:43,417
Mama, what's that?

1301
01:18:43,618 --> 01:18:46,587
ls that a picture of Daddy?
Let me see that.

1302
01:18:46,788 --> 01:18:48,483
Give it here.

1303
01:18:49,825 --> 01:18:52,350
-So you still love him?
-No.

1304
01:18:52,561 --> 01:18:55,496
That's a piece of him
l keep as a reminder...

1305
01:18:55,697 --> 01:18:58,029
...that l made the right decision.

1306
01:18:58,233 --> 01:19:00,701
Do you miss him at all?

1307
01:19:05,941 --> 01:19:09,377
Do you remember that
cheerleading competition l won?

1308
01:19:09,578 --> 01:19:13,036
l remember all your accomplishments,
Clarice. What you want?

1309
01:19:13,248 --> 01:19:16,376
That was the same weekend
Daddy left.

1310
01:19:18,086 --> 01:19:19,519
But all l remember you saying--

1311
01:19:19,721 --> 01:19:24,385
Don't start dredging up all that mess.
That's good riddance to bad rubbish.

1312
01:19:24,993 --> 01:19:29,760
All l remember you ever saying to me
was how he cheated on you...

1313
01:19:29,965 --> 01:19:32,559
...and how he was
a horrible husband.

1314
01:19:32,768 --> 01:19:34,565
Never really got his side.

1315
01:19:35,303 --> 01:19:39,797
Finally talked to Daddy, and he said
that he never slept with that woman.

1316
01:19:40,008 --> 01:19:42,033
He said you drove him
out of the house, Mama.

1317
01:19:42,244 --> 01:19:44,007
He didn't sleep with her until after--

1318
01:19:44,212 --> 01:19:46,840
-l'm not having this conversation.
-Why?

1319
01:19:47,048 --> 01:19:50,347
Because my bedroom drama with your
daddy ain't none of your business.

1320
01:19:50,552 --> 01:19:52,383
Excuse me?

1321
01:19:53,989 --> 01:19:55,718
The way you're all up in my marriage?

1322
01:19:55,924 --> 01:19:58,984
You convinced me
to put my husband out of my house.

1323
01:19:59,194 --> 01:20:01,185
l think it is my business, Mama.

1324
01:20:01,396 --> 01:20:03,296
Don't talk to me like that.

1325
01:20:03,865 --> 01:20:06,527
Okay, all right.

1326
01:20:09,905 --> 01:20:11,873
You wanna know?

1327
01:20:12,073 --> 01:20:13,597
Yes.

1328
01:20:15,043 --> 01:20:16,943
Your daddy was rotten.

1329
01:20:18,814 --> 01:20:22,978
You were too young to understand
what was going on in that house.

1330
01:20:26,087 --> 01:20:27,816
He was a nasty bastard.

1331
01:20:28,023 --> 01:20:30,617
-Mama--
-Don't ''Mama'' me.

1332
01:20:34,196 --> 01:20:36,494
He hit me...

1333
01:20:41,002 --> 01:20:43,232
...in my face.

1334
01:20:45,273 --> 01:20:48,470
Now, you listen to me real good.

1335
01:20:49,778 --> 01:20:54,806
When they stay,
and they done already left...

1336
01:20:56,418 --> 01:20:58,716
...they get mean.

1337
01:21:02,123 --> 01:21:03,420
l hated your daddy.

1338
01:21:03,625 --> 01:21:05,024
-Mama.
-No, l hated him.

1339
01:21:05,227 --> 01:21:06,694
l hated him!

1340
01:21:07,762 --> 01:21:11,596
You were right to throw Dave's ass
out of here before he hits you.

1341
01:21:11,800 --> 01:21:15,429
No. No, David's not like that.

1342
01:21:16,338 --> 01:21:18,704
And that wasn't the way
to handle that.

1343
01:21:18,907 --> 01:21:20,568
l shouldn't have listened to you.

1344
01:21:24,112 --> 01:21:26,137
l shouldn't have listened to you.

1345
01:21:26,348 --> 01:21:28,646
l'm not gonna talk about this.

1346
01:21:28,850 --> 01:21:30,442
l'm not.

1347
01:21:33,121 --> 01:21:37,524
Black women have to be strong
and you know that.

1348
01:21:37,726 --> 01:21:39,318
l don't know what kind of pain...

1349
01:21:39,527 --> 01:21:41,654
...you are holding on to
in your heart, Mama...

1350
01:21:41,863 --> 01:21:45,629
...but you need to let it go.
You need to just let it go.

1351
01:21:47,402 --> 01:21:50,530
And in all your lessons about
how l need to be strong...

1352
01:21:50,739 --> 01:21:52,730
...and proud
and independent, Mama...

1353
01:21:52,941 --> 01:21:55,239
...you left out
some very important things.

1354
01:21:55,443 --> 01:21:59,174
-What?
-How to love, Mama.

1355
01:22:00,482 --> 01:22:05,385
How to really care about somebody.
How to forgive.

1356
01:22:05,921 --> 01:22:08,082
l cared about you.

1357
01:22:10,125 --> 01:22:13,993
l loved you the best l could.

1358
01:22:16,164 --> 01:22:20,498
l gave you everything in me
that he didn't take.

1359
01:22:22,771 --> 01:22:25,171
And he took everything.

1360
01:22:28,043 --> 01:22:29,977
Can't you see that?

1361
01:22:30,178 --> 01:22:32,305
l know you did, Mama.

1362
01:22:34,015 --> 01:22:40,079
And if that ain't good enough for you,
then l'm sorry for you.

1363
01:22:40,288 --> 01:22:41,880
No.

1364
01:22:42,524 --> 01:22:45,823
Mama, l'm so sorry for you.

1365
01:22:48,196 --> 01:22:52,496
l didn't mean to come out here
and disrespect you, l really didn't.

1366
01:22:56,171 --> 01:22:58,605
But it's time for me to grow up...

1367
01:22:58,807 --> 01:23:02,072
...and l'm gonna have to ask you
to leave my house...

1368
01:23:02,277 --> 01:23:04,268
...because l want my husband.

1369
01:23:04,913 --> 01:23:09,282
l want my husband back,
and l want to fight for my marriage.

1370
01:23:09,484 --> 01:23:13,284
Because, Mama,
l don't want to end up like you.

1371
01:23:13,488 --> 01:23:14,921
l don't.

1372
01:23:18,393 --> 01:23:20,623
l'm gonna pray for you, Mama.

1373
01:23:23,598 --> 01:23:26,066
l love you so much.

1374
01:23:29,771 --> 01:23:31,398
Little girl.

1375
01:23:35,377 --> 01:23:37,845
You pray for yourself.

1376
01:23:40,815 --> 01:23:43,147
l'll be gone when you get back.

1377
01:23:44,753 --> 01:23:46,380
Go on.

1378
01:23:47,822 --> 01:23:49,380
Okay.

1379
01:23:51,092 --> 01:23:52,650
Okay.

1380
01:24:03,171 --> 01:24:06,607
I'm not sorry about what we did.
I love you.

1381
01:24:06,808 --> 01:24:08,469
-Please leave.
-Not until we talk.

1382
01:24:08,676 --> 01:24:11,941
We can't.
If Shawn comes up here and....

1383
01:24:12,147 --> 01:24:14,581
-He can never find out about this.
-He won't.

1384
01:24:15,450 --> 01:24:18,248
Then why are you even doing this?

1385
01:24:18,453 --> 01:24:21,047
Hey, hey!
Hey, come on, Dave, knock.

1386
01:24:21,256 --> 01:24:23,190
-You scared me.
-What are you doing here?

1387
01:24:23,391 --> 01:24:25,518
What do you mean?
Why didn't you knock?

1388
01:24:25,727 --> 01:24:26,785
l just came by.

1389
01:24:26,995 --> 01:24:31,091
Talked to the manager. l told him l was
your probation officer, he let me up.

1390
01:24:31,299 --> 01:24:34,234
-So, what are you doing here?
-l can't come by to see my friend?

1391
01:24:34,436 --> 01:24:35,926
l know what you're going through.

1392
01:24:36,137 --> 01:24:39,300
l wanna make sure that everything
that you are going through is cool.

1393
01:24:39,507 --> 01:24:42,067
-Make sure you're copasetic.
-What are you watching?

1394
01:24:42,277 --> 01:24:44,302
Just something to
make me feel better. l had--

1395
01:24:44,512 --> 01:24:46,377
Vanessa kicked your ass out,
didn't she?

1396
01:24:46,581 --> 01:24:51,018
First of all, that's just crazy to even
think that she would kick me out.

1397
01:24:51,219 --> 01:24:53,380
Okay, why would she kick
her husband out?

1398
01:24:53,588 --> 01:24:55,613
Her husband,
the man she's supposed to love.

1399
01:24:55,824 --> 01:24:58,793
Can l tell you what she said to me?
Can l tell you what she said?

1400
01:24:58,993 --> 01:25:00,927
-Listen, look at me.
-What did she say?

1401
01:25:01,129 --> 01:25:02,756
She told me l'm too emotional.

1402
01:25:04,099 --> 01:25:06,033
l'm way too in touch
with my feminine side.

1403
01:25:06,234 --> 01:25:09,294
No man should apologize
to nobody that much.

1404
01:25:09,504 --> 01:25:11,495
My feet, she don't like my feet now.

1405
01:25:11,706 --> 01:25:13,435
All of a sudden
my feet is a problem?

1406
01:25:13,641 --> 01:25:15,074
But her back, l can accept that?

1407
01:25:15,276 --> 01:25:17,870
-You can't accept my feet?
-Here's what l want you to do.

1408
01:25:18,079 --> 01:25:19,410
Go back home to your wife.

1409
01:25:19,614 --> 01:25:21,479
No, l'm gonna make her think
l'm cheating.

1410
01:25:21,683 --> 01:25:23,776
You need to go back home
to your wife.

1411
01:25:23,985 --> 01:25:26,010
-Why don't you--?
-Go back home to your wife.

1412
01:25:26,221 --> 01:25:29,190
Can you talk to me? Listen,
can you talk to me for two seconds?

1413
01:25:29,390 --> 01:25:33,690
Why can't me and you get in touch,
figure out why this keep happening?

1414
01:25:33,895 --> 01:25:35,362
-l'm emotional now.
-Good men.

1415
01:25:35,563 --> 01:25:37,394
-Good brothers.
-Emotional, here we go.

1416
01:25:37,599 --> 01:25:38,588
We're good black men.

1417
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:40,358
-Got my toiletry bag?
-Here you go.

1418
01:25:40,568 --> 01:25:42,297
-Because l don't want to--
-Here we go.

1419
01:25:42,504 --> 01:25:44,131
l love you, l don't tell you enough.

1420
01:25:44,339 --> 01:25:46,307
-Here we go.
-All right, you right.

1421
01:25:46,508 --> 01:25:48,203
-Thank you, Dave.
-Have a good night.

1422
01:25:48,409 --> 01:25:50,775
Do you got my toiletry bag? Okay.

1423
01:26:19,107 --> 01:26:20,597
Hello.

1424
01:26:50,638 --> 01:26:53,801
Thank you for coming.

1425
01:26:55,510 --> 01:26:58,104
And thank you
for taking care of everything. l--

1426
01:27:01,049 --> 01:27:02,846
l couldn't have done it.

1427
01:27:03,184 --> 01:27:04,515
Are you okay?

1428
01:27:05,453 --> 01:27:10,755
l think he was so focused
on winning and that medal, he....

1429
01:27:12,627 --> 01:27:13,958
His coach told him about--

1430
01:27:15,496 --> 01:27:17,088
Why didn't l remind him?

1431
01:27:22,470 --> 01:27:26,429
''You have to take the trash out
when we get home.''

1432
01:27:28,243 --> 01:27:29,232
What?

1433
01:27:29,911 --> 01:27:33,813
That's the last thing l said to him.
Before the race.

1434
01:27:34,015 --> 01:27:38,452
''You have to take the trash out
when we get home.''

1435
01:27:40,455 --> 01:27:42,389
Not ''l love you.''

1436
01:27:43,958 --> 01:27:46,756
Not ''l'm so proud of you.''

1437
01:27:47,128 --> 01:27:49,119
Not ''l'm so lucky to be your mom.''

1438
01:27:49,330 --> 01:27:51,628
''You've got to take the trash out
when we get home.''

1439
01:27:51,833 --> 01:27:54,301
-lt's okay.
-No, it is not gonna be okay.

1440
01:27:57,205 --> 01:28:00,902
lt's-- lt's never gonna be okay.

1441
01:28:04,512 --> 01:28:06,275
Oh, my God. lt's just not gonna be.

1442
01:28:06,481 --> 01:28:09,882
-lt's all right.
-You can't make it better.

1443
01:28:12,186 --> 01:28:14,347
Just stop.

1444
01:28:15,857 --> 01:28:18,417
lt's not. lt never is.

1445
01:28:42,784 --> 01:28:45,150
Wait, no, wait.

1446
01:28:47,422 --> 01:28:49,481
l can't do this.

1447
01:28:56,364 --> 01:28:57,991
l know.

1448
01:29:01,102 --> 01:29:02,899
l'm sorry.

1449
01:29:04,739 --> 01:29:06,070
l know.

1450
01:29:39,774 --> 01:29:42,140
Now, you tell the crew for me
there are four ways...

1451
01:29:42,343 --> 01:29:43,935
...of doing things onboard my ship:

1452
01:29:44,145 --> 01:29:46,875
The right way, the wrong way,
the Navy way, and my way.

1453
01:29:47,448 --> 01:29:49,882
If they do things my way,
we'll get along.

1454
01:29:50,084 --> 01:29:51,745
-Aye, aye, sir.
-Okay.

1455
01:29:53,855 --> 01:29:56,824
Oh, the manager gave me a key.

1456
01:29:57,024 --> 01:29:59,788
-l can leave if you--
-No, no, no, it's cool.

1457
01:30:01,129 --> 01:30:03,689
That manager
would give a key to anybody.

1458
01:30:11,139 --> 01:30:13,937
David, l just need you
to let me say some things, okay?

1459
01:30:15,943 --> 01:30:19,674
l have been round
and round with my heart...

1460
01:30:20,948 --> 01:30:22,745
...and l want you to know two things.

1461
01:30:22,950 --> 01:30:25,544
First of all, Mama has lost...

1462
01:30:25,753 --> 01:30:28,119
...all of her voting privileges
in this marriage.

1463
01:30:29,957 --> 01:30:32,187
And, second...

1464
01:30:34,962 --> 01:30:38,261
...no one ever taught me
how to be one of those wives...

1465
01:30:38,466 --> 01:30:41,663
...who holds on
to her man's every word.

1466
01:30:41,869 --> 01:30:46,738
And no one taught me how to trust him
to take care of me, you know?

1467
01:30:47,942 --> 01:30:51,901
l really don't know
if l could ever be that woman...

1468
01:30:53,114 --> 01:30:56,242
...but l do want to learn
how to be your partner.

1469
01:30:58,853 --> 01:31:01,549
And whatever you decide...

1470
01:31:03,558 --> 01:31:06,356
...l need you to know
that l can't live without you, David.

1471
01:31:06,561 --> 01:31:10,429
l don't want to live without you
and l love you so much.

1472
01:31:14,302 --> 01:31:15,701
Come here.

1473
01:31:18,306 --> 01:31:19,830
What's that?

1474
01:31:20,842 --> 01:31:23,208
l heated you up a plate...

1475
01:31:23,411 --> 01:31:28,314
...because you're staying in
a roach motel and l wanted you to eat.

1476
01:31:29,383 --> 01:31:31,647
-l cooked it.
-You cooked it?

1477
01:31:31,853 --> 01:31:33,821
-Yes.
-There ain't poison in this, is there?

1478
01:31:39,427 --> 01:31:40,519
You're not gonna eat it?

1479
01:31:40,728 --> 01:31:42,958
You're not gonna eat the food?

1480
01:31:47,235 --> 01:31:49,032
Hi.

1481
01:32:31,178 --> 01:32:32,611
What up?

1482
01:32:36,150 --> 01:32:37,276
What up?

1483
01:32:38,019 --> 01:32:39,384
You know, l was hoping, man...

1484
01:32:39,587 --> 01:32:42,351
...l can get Darius
back on your team, you know?

1485
01:32:46,861 --> 01:32:51,958
lt's like you, you know--
You helping him to be a better man.

1486
01:33:00,875 --> 01:33:02,843
Why don't we both do that?

1487
01:33:25,900 --> 01:33:26,992
Darius, where you at?

1488
01:33:28,803 --> 01:33:32,671
Okay. Listen,
l got you back on the team, man.

1489
01:33:35,509 --> 01:33:37,841
Yeah, and l got you a new glove.

1490
01:33:38,045 --> 01:33:43,984
So l want you to come back home
and be there by, like, 5:00.

1491
01:33:45,786 --> 01:33:47,583
And....

1492
01:33:50,024 --> 01:33:52,390
l love you, man. You know?

1493
01:33:55,429 --> 01:33:56,794
Yeah.

1494
01:34:00,034 --> 01:34:01,433
All right.

1495
01:34:04,505 --> 01:34:09,499
I found out that if you wanna know
the purpose of a thing...

1496
01:34:09,710 --> 01:34:12,474
...you can't ask the thing to tell you.

1497
01:34:12,680 --> 01:34:15,046
A car doesn't know why it's a car.

1498
01:34:15,249 --> 01:34:18,741
Only the manufacturer knows
what it was made to do.

1499
01:34:19,587 --> 01:34:23,318
And I guess that's the way it is
with us and God.

1500
01:34:24,225 --> 01:34:25,487
You know...

1501
01:34:28,829 --> 01:34:31,855
...you'd make
an excellent daddy someday.

1502
01:34:32,700 --> 01:34:34,497
Well, l hope so.

1503
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:43,776
What about in, like,
seven and a half months?

1504
01:34:46,080 --> 01:34:47,240
Are you saying that...?

1505
01:35:11,072 --> 01:35:14,701
God didn't just make Dave Johnson
to be a husband...

1506
01:35:14,909 --> 01:35:19,972
...or a coach, a friend, or a daddy.

1507
01:35:20,281 --> 01:35:24,980
Those are just roles,
not who I am as a man.

1508
01:35:31,258 --> 01:35:33,317
But I guess, sometimes...

1509
01:35:33,527 --> 01:35:36,690
...he has to let life
turn you upside-down...

1510
01:35:40,801 --> 01:35:45,898
...so you can learn how to live
right side up.
