00:00:38,852 --> 00:00:42,117
I still have the dream sometimes.

2
00:00:43,457 --> 00:00:47,587
I do. I come home from the store
and find you on my doorstep

3
00:00:47,694 --> 00:00:48,854
with a suitcase.

4
00:00:48,962 --> 00:00:51,624
And not your entire wardrobe.

5
00:00:51,732 --> 00:00:54,997
Just a carry-on, a duffel bag.

6
00:00:55,602 --> 00:00:57,502
We don't say anything,

7
00:00:57,604 --> 00:01:01,631
<i>but you have this look
in your eye that kills me. </i>

8
00:01:02,008 --> 00:01:03,669
<i>It just...</i>

9
00:01:05,345 --> 00:01:08,314
And I unlock the door and let you in.

10
00:01:08,415 --> 00:01:13,114
And that's it.
That's the dream.

11
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:16,587
<i>When I wake up, I wake up happy...</i>

12
00:01:17,457 --> 00:01:21,086
<i>vibrating for a few seconds
with my head in the sand...</i>

13
00:01:21,194 --> 00:01:23,492
<i>content. </i>

14
00:01:27,567 --> 00:01:31,901
Then it goes away, and you go away.

15
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:36,470
I really don't want
to get out of bed then

16
00:01:36,576 --> 00:01:38,168
because it's cold out there,

17
00:01:38,278 --> 00:01:40,439
but I do.

18
00:01:40,947 --> 00:01:45,008
I get up. Life goes on.

19
00:01:56,196 --> 00:01:59,791
Most days you never
even cross my mind.

20
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:06,296
Tell me that you love me.

21
00:02:22,422 --> 00:02:24,515
<i>My name is Dakota Skye. </i>

22
00:02:24,691 --> 00:02:27,182
<i>I'm 18 years old,
only medium-cute,</i>

23
00:02:27,294 --> 00:02:30,786
<i>and I have a superpower. </i>

24
00:02:33,266 --> 00:02:36,394
<i>I can't fly,
I can't turn invisible,</i>

25
00:02:36,503 --> 00:02:41,805
<i>and I'm pretty sure that a bullet
would make me good and dead. </i>

26
00:02:42,275 --> 00:02:45,642
<i>I don't have x-ray vision, either. </i>

27
00:02:45,946 --> 00:02:48,881
<i>Well, not exactly. </i>

28
00:02:50,116 --> 00:02:55,952
<i>The fact is I am
incapable of being lied to. </i>

29
00:02:56,122 --> 00:02:58,420
<i>When someone tells a lie, any lie,</i>

30
00:02:58,525 --> 00:03:01,961
<i>to me, to anyone, I know the truth,
what they really mean,</i>

31
00:03:02,062 --> 00:03:05,964
<i>so there are no lies in my world,</i>

32
00:03:06,132 --> 00:03:08,123
<i>or there are nothing but. </i>

33
00:03:08,235 --> 00:03:10,396
<i>It's kind of hard to explain. </i>

34
00:03:10,504 --> 00:03:12,734
<i>It's like movies from other countries. </i>

35
00:03:12,839 --> 00:03:14,431
<i>Somebody says something in French</i>

36
00:03:14,541 --> 00:03:17,840
<i>like "Voulez-vous
coucher avec mol, ce solr?"</i>

37
00:03:17,944 --> 00:03:21,710
<i>and at the bottom
of the screen it says...</i>

38
00:03:22,382 --> 00:03:25,909
<i>I don't know what it says.
I flunked French. </i>

39
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:29,615
<i>But I've been this way since...</i>

40
00:03:29,723 --> 00:03:33,022
<i>I guess since I was little. </i>

41
00:03:37,631 --> 00:03:38,893
Who are you?

42
00:03:39,065 --> 00:03:41,397
It's me, Santa Claus.

43
00:03:41,501 --> 00:03:43,298
Liar!

44
00:03:43,703 --> 00:03:47,537
In this section,
we're going to look at explorers.

45
00:03:47,641 --> 00:03:52,669
Christopher Columbus
discovered America in 1492.

46
00:03:52,779 --> 00:03:54,713
He was a great explorer,

47
00:03:54,814 --> 00:03:59,945
and really the first important figure
in the history of our country.

48
00:04:17,604 --> 00:04:19,231
Is Daddy gonna be okay?

49
00:04:22,742 --> 00:04:27,441
He's going to be just fine.

50
00:04:28,114 --> 00:04:29,547
<i>And sophomore year,</i>

51
00:04:29,649 --> 00:04:31,844
<i>when Jacob Barrow
told me that he loved me,</i>

52
00:04:31,952 --> 00:04:34,648
<i>well, I let him
take my virginity anyway. </i>

53
00:04:34,754 --> 00:04:36,654
<i>It had to go sometime. </i>

54
00:04:37,857 --> 00:04:39,381
<i>And to the best of my knowledge,</i>

55
00:04:39,559 --> 00:04:41,527
<i>I've never been bitten
by a radioactive spider</i>

56
00:04:41,628 --> 00:04:44,688
<i>or dosed with an overabundance
of gamma rays -- </i>

57
00:04:44,798 --> 00:04:46,561
<i>whatever those are. </i>

58
00:04:49,102 --> 00:04:50,467
<i>I have no explanation. </i>

59
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:53,869
<i>I'm just involuntarily
cursed with the truth,</i>

60
00:04:53,974 --> 00:04:58,070
<i>something people spend
their entire lives looking for. </i>

61
00:04:58,645 --> 00:05:00,704
<i>Lucky me. </i>

62
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,982
Dorian Wallace.

63
00:05:12,659 --> 00:05:14,388
Hey.

64
00:05:16,062 --> 00:05:18,963
I'm so happy for you.

65
00:05:19,099 --> 00:05:21,329
<i>I know. I know...</i>

66
00:05:23,136 --> 00:05:24,569
All right.
Well, see you there, okay?

67
00:05:24,671 --> 00:05:27,139
Okay. Yeah, I'm just gonna go home
and change really fast, okay?

68
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,798
Us, too.

69
00:05:29,576 --> 00:05:30,702
Hey, Dakota!

70
00:05:31,544 --> 00:05:33,205
Yeah?

71
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:35,470
Congratulations.

72
00:05:37,484 --> 00:05:40,009
Thanks. You too.

73
00:05:48,028 --> 00:05:50,963
<i>So, in order to explain
why I'm about to ditch my friends</i>

74
00:05:51,131 --> 00:05:53,292
<i>and drive 2,500 miles across country</i>

75
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:56,028
<i>less than an hour
after graduating high school,</i>

76
00:05:56,136 --> 00:05:59,594
<i>I'll have to tell you a story,</i>

77
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,641
<i>a story about a different
Dakota Skye. </i>

78
00:06:07,414 --> 00:06:12,351
<i>You see, every superhero
has a nemesis, an archenemy. </i>

79
00:06:13,053 --> 00:06:17,752
<i>Mine is a cute
stoner boy named Jonah. </i>

80
00:06:29,436 --> 00:06:33,099
<i>This Dakota Skye
Is only 17 years old. </i>

81
00:06:36,176 --> 00:06:37,803
What frame were we on?

82
00:06:37,911 --> 00:06:39,606
8.

83
00:06:39,713 --> 00:06:41,613
What's my score?

84
00:06:41,981 --> 00:06:44,449
184.

85
00:06:44,551 --> 00:06:45,813
What's yours?

86
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:47,511
Don't worry.
I think you're gonna win.

87
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:49,554
Come on. Tell me your score.
What is it?

88
00:06:49,756 --> 00:06:53,055
- 42.
- Ah, see? You're getting better, babe.

89
00:07:01,067 --> 00:07:03,695
Ha! Take that, bitches!

90
00:07:05,638 --> 00:07:07,196
How about a kiss?

91
00:07:07,307 --> 00:07:09,502
Your turn.

92
00:07:30,396 --> 00:07:32,091
- What was I saying before?
- The demo.

93
00:07:32,198 --> 00:07:33,597
Yes, demo.

94
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,895
Jacob said he's going to get it to his
cousin once we get the mix done.

95
00:07:36,002 --> 00:07:37,469
- His cousin?
- Yeah.

96
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:38,969
The one who works at Sub- Pop.
I told you about that.

97
00:07:39,072 --> 00:07:42,200
Oh, that's right. You did.

98
00:07:43,143 --> 00:07:45,611
Are you gonna come with me
on Wednesday to band practice?

99
00:07:45,712 --> 00:07:46,906
Where?

100
00:07:47,213 --> 00:07:48,475
At Jacob's.

101
00:07:49,582 --> 00:07:51,516
- Maybe.
- Maybe? Why not?

102
00:07:51,618 --> 00:07:52,710
I said "maybe. "

103
00:07:52,886 --> 00:07:54,615
- Yeah, but you meant "no. "
- Jacob hates me.

104
00:07:54,721 --> 00:07:57,519
He does not!

105
00:08:08,034 --> 00:08:09,592
Want to get out of here?

106
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:23,210
Oh, God, I love you.

107
00:08:27,787 --> 00:08:29,652
Are you okay?

108
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:32,824
Yeah?

109
00:08:33,526 --> 00:08:34,788
Are you gonna come?

110
00:08:35,394 --> 00:08:40,230
Keep going.

111
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:50,470
Oh, God, I love you.

112
00:08:57,450 --> 00:08:59,384
Oh, don't move.

113
00:09:09,696 --> 00:09:10,526
Oh, yeah.

114
00:09:12,498 --> 00:09:16,798
<i>Kevin is a liar,
but no more than anybody else. </i>

115
00:09:17,871 --> 00:09:20,499
<i>Certainly no more than me. </i>

116
00:09:25,578 --> 00:09:27,512
<i>I hate Kevin
less than almost anybody,</i>

117
00:09:27,614 --> 00:09:29,582
<i>and his looks don't make me vomit. </i>

118
00:09:29,682 --> 00:09:31,843
<i>So he's my boyfriend. </i>

119
00:09:31,951 --> 00:09:37,253
<i>And he's talented and a nice guy,
and we have fun,</i>

120
00:09:37,357 --> 00:09:40,793
<i>and the first couple of times that he
told me that he loved me he meant It. </i>

121
00:09:40,894 --> 00:09:43,124
<i>At least, he thought he did. </i>

122
00:09:43,229 --> 00:09:46,824
<i>And if he ever cheats on me,
well, I'll know. </i>

123
00:09:50,637 --> 00:09:54,437
<i>"Dearest Dakota, gone to L. A.
Be back tomorrow night. </i>

124
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:59,273
<i>Left cash in the cookie jar.
Love, Mom. "</i>

125
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,041
<i>Junior year is almost over,
and everyone -- </i>

126
00:10:03,149 --> 00:10:08,177
<i>all my friends, all the teachers --
all they talk about is the future,</i>

127
00:10:08,288 --> 00:10:12,019
<i>about college and careers
and all that shit. </i>

128
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:15,356
<i>I have never been able
to think that far. </i>

129
00:10:15,461 --> 00:10:17,691
<i>Beth is the worst of them. </i>

130
00:10:17,797 --> 00:10:22,097
<i>I think she's got the next 25 years
of her life planned down to the hour. </i>

131
00:10:22,201 --> 00:10:24,362
<i>I don't think
she even likes me anymore. </i>

132
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:28,930
<i>Well, being me, I know
she doesn't like me anymore. </i>

133
00:10:29,042 --> 00:10:29,701
<i>Why should she?</i>

134
00:10:29,809 --> 00:10:34,837
<i>I mean, I'm bitchy and sad
and angry and distant all the time. </i>

135
00:10:34,948 --> 00:10:37,940
<i>I'm not even sure I like me anymore. </i>

136
00:10:38,051 --> 00:10:42,249
<i>We're friends because we have been
for the better part of the last 12 years. </i>

137
00:10:42,355 --> 00:10:46,416
<i>No other reason.
We are because we are. </i>

138
00:10:47,493 --> 00:10:51,486
<i>So, year after year, lie after lie,</i>

139
00:10:51,597 --> 00:10:54,566
<i>It's all been building
inside my head like a snowball. </i>

140
00:10:54,667 --> 00:10:55,964
You're right, Jeannie--

141
00:10:56,369 --> 00:10:57,927
Thomas Jefferson
did own some slaves.

142
00:10:58,037 --> 00:11:00,096
He was, after all, a man of his times,

143
00:11:00,206 --> 00:11:01,764
but he treated the slaves

144
00:11:01,874 --> 00:11:03,603
that he owned quite well.

145
00:11:05,645 --> 00:11:07,306
<i>I used to be able to keep it in check. </i>

146
00:11:07,413 --> 00:11:11,406
<i>When it was my folks and teachers,
It seemed okay. </i>

147
00:11:11,517 --> 00:11:16,079
On his deathbed, in fact,
he freed many of them.

148
00:11:16,289 --> 00:11:18,519
<i>And then boys and sex
came into the picture,</i>

149
00:11:18,624 --> 00:11:23,425
<i>and with boys, more lies,
with sex, more lies. </i>

150
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:26,521
<i>I go through weeks at a time
just praying someone</i>

151
00:11:26,632 --> 00:11:29,795
<i>will actually say
what they mean for once. </i>

152
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:34,201
<i>Like I said,
It's kind of hard to explain. </i>

153
00:11:42,782 --> 00:11:44,215
Hey!

154
00:11:44,584 --> 00:11:46,245
Hey.

155
00:11:47,153 --> 00:11:48,518
Dakota, what's wrong?

156
00:11:48,888 --> 00:11:50,253
Nothing.

157
00:11:50,423 --> 00:11:51,685
I forgot to bring in your CD.

158
00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:54,419
I'll bring it back tomorrow, okay?

159
00:11:54,527 --> 00:11:56,154
Yeah. Sure.

160
00:11:56,863 --> 00:11:58,057
Hey, guys.

161
00:11:58,164 --> 00:12:00,098
Hey, Denise.

162
00:12:00,199 --> 00:12:01,632
So, what time tonight?

163
00:12:01,734 --> 00:12:04,202
- Say, like, 5:00?
- 5:00's good.

164
00:12:04,303 --> 00:12:05,770
Do you want us to bring anything?

165
00:12:05,938 --> 00:12:08,065
- Soda, maybe snacks.
- What are you guys talking about?

166
00:12:08,174 --> 00:12:10,870
We're studying for the S.A.T.'s
at my house tonight, remember?

167
00:12:11,044 --> 00:12:12,477
You said you'd come.

168
00:12:12,578 --> 00:12:14,205
That does not sound like me.

169
00:12:14,313 --> 00:12:15,712
The test is in 2 weeks.

170
00:12:15,882 --> 00:12:17,213
We really need to study.

171
00:12:18,885 --> 00:12:22,343
Oh, what is this? An intervention?

172
00:12:22,455 --> 00:12:25,049
No.

173
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:33,722
- Let's go.
- So, you'll be there?

174
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:36,425
I don't even know
if I want to go to college.

175
00:12:36,602 --> 00:12:39,093
Well, we already signed you up
for the next test.

176
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:41,306
That can't be legal.

177
00:12:41,574 --> 00:12:45,738
- So, you'll be there?
- Sure.

178
00:12:46,779 --> 00:12:48,007
Good.

179
00:12:48,981 --> 00:12:50,778
Come on, guys.

180
00:12:53,719 --> 00:12:56,586
<i>God, it's hot here. </i>

181
00:12:59,792 --> 00:13:02,488
Hey, little girl.
You want some candy?

182
00:13:02,595 --> 00:13:05,189
I don't know. My mommy told me
never to talk to strangers.

183
00:13:05,364 --> 00:13:08,333
Oh, I guess it will be
our little secret, then, huh?

184
00:13:08,768 --> 00:13:12,295
Mm, okay, if you got candy.

185
00:13:27,987 --> 00:13:30,478
What time is it?

186
00:13:31,357 --> 00:13:34,793
I don't know.
Like, 11:00. 12:00, maybe.

187
00:13:34,894 --> 00:13:39,524
- Don't you have school?
- Not until morning.

188
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:43,564
Where were you?

189
00:13:43,669 --> 00:13:45,034
Where was I what?

190
00:13:45,138 --> 00:13:47,129
Tonight. Denise's.

191
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,674
Oh, I guess I forgot. I'm sorry.

192
00:13:49,775 --> 00:13:52,073
Oh, I was worried.

193
00:13:52,178 --> 00:13:53,202
Why?

194
00:13:53,312 --> 00:13:57,806
Well, for starters, you're not studying,
you're not sleeping,

195
00:13:57,917 --> 00:14:01,148
you're barely keeping a C average,
it's 1:00 in the morning,

196
00:14:01,254 --> 00:14:02,619
and you're at freakin' Jim's.

197
00:14:02,722 --> 00:14:05,213
Hey, leave Jim's out of this.

198
00:14:05,324 --> 00:14:07,690
And you make a C average
sound bad.

199
00:14:08,694 --> 00:14:11,527
Beth, seriously, I'm fine.

200
00:14:11,631 --> 00:14:13,929
I am fine.

201
00:14:14,033 --> 00:14:17,491
Kev, will you please
tell your girl to straighten up?

202
00:14:17,603 --> 00:14:19,093
Well, she's sitting right there.
You tell her.

203
00:14:19,205 --> 00:14:21,969
All right, fine. We're doing another
S. A. T. thing on Thursday night.

204
00:14:22,074 --> 00:14:25,009
Will you please just come?

205
00:14:25,111 --> 00:14:27,511
Oh, wow. Yeah. That's amazing.

206
00:14:27,613 --> 00:14:29,171
I got to piss. Could you scoot?

207
00:14:29,282 --> 00:14:30,112
Thanks.

208
00:14:30,216 --> 00:14:33,185
You piss more than a girl.

209
00:14:35,788 --> 00:14:37,756
Well, fuck me with a stiff midget.

210
00:14:37,857 --> 00:14:39,290
Yo, T!

211
00:14:39,392 --> 00:14:42,953
Holy shit, dude!
When the fuck did you get in town?

212
00:14:43,129 --> 00:14:45,689
How did I know
I'd find you assholes here?

213
00:14:45,798 --> 00:14:47,322
Broadway Danny Rose.

214
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,524
- Hey.
- Good to see you.

215
00:14:48,634 --> 00:14:50,067
You too, man.
Good to see you, Terry.

216
00:14:50,169 --> 00:14:53,195
Oh, Jonah! it's been so long!

217
00:14:53,306 --> 00:14:54,568
Yeah, yeah. How you been?

218
00:14:54,674 --> 00:14:56,505
- Oh, good, good.
- Nice.

219
00:14:56,709 --> 00:15:00,304
<i>This is um...uh...fuck...Beth,</i>

220
00:15:00,413 --> 00:15:02,938
and this is my girlfriend Dakota.

221
00:15:03,115 --> 00:15:06,380
- Girls, I give you Jonah Moreno.
- Nice to meet you!

222
00:15:06,552 --> 00:15:07,849
It's a pleasure.

223
00:15:09,522 --> 00:15:11,285
Hey, Heather! Cup of coffee?

224
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:12,322
Sure thing, Jonah.

225
00:15:12,425 --> 00:15:14,052
Black?

226
00:15:15,761 --> 00:15:16,785
This is so weird.

227
00:15:16,896 --> 00:15:19,296
- When did you get into town?
- Uh, last night.

228
00:15:19,398 --> 00:15:23,129
- I started driving Sunday.
- You drove across country?

229
00:15:23,236 --> 00:15:25,329
This kid's crazy.

230
00:15:25,438 --> 00:15:26,905
Jonah's from New York.

231
00:15:27,573 --> 00:15:30,269
My name is Jonah,
and I'm a starving actor.

232
00:15:30,376 --> 00:15:32,071
Jonah's, like, one
of my best friends, too.

233
00:15:32,245 --> 00:15:33,974
I thought I was your best friend.

234
00:15:34,146 --> 00:15:35,636
You are, baby.

235
00:15:35,748 --> 00:15:36,942
How long are you in town for?

236
00:15:37,149 --> 00:15:39,583
Tell I get sick of you fucks.

237
00:15:39,785 --> 00:15:41,776
Ha-ha. That's my boy.

238
00:15:43,155 --> 00:15:44,315
I was looking to get
into some trouble tonight.

239
00:15:44,423 --> 00:15:48,018
You guys got to do anything
tomorrow morning?

240
00:15:49,095 --> 00:15:50,494
Dude, fuck that. I'm down.

241
00:15:50,596 --> 00:15:52,530
Let's go get lifted. We'll drop off
Dakota on the way home.

242
00:15:52,632 --> 00:15:53,257
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

243
00:15:53,366 --> 00:15:56,164
- You think Bobby would be down?
- Dude, Bobby's always fucking down.

244
00:16:08,281 --> 00:16:10,181
- Good night.
- 'Night.

245
00:16:10,283 --> 00:16:11,215
It's nice meeting you, Dakota.

246
00:16:11,317 --> 00:16:14,252
Yeah, you too.
What are you guys gonna do tonight?

247
00:16:29,001 --> 00:16:32,368
<i>God damn It. It's hot. </i>

248
00:17:24,523 --> 00:17:25,615
Hey!

249
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:27,554
Hey. What are you doing here?

250
00:17:28,127 --> 00:17:30,152
Kev called. He said band practice
is going really well.

251
00:17:30,262 --> 00:17:31,354
He didn't want to break it off.

252
00:17:33,099 --> 00:17:35,761
Get in the car.
I'll take you over to Jacob's.

253
00:17:35,935 --> 00:17:38,802
No, you don't have to do that.
It's fine.

254
00:17:38,904 --> 00:17:40,701
Don't be retarded.

255
00:17:41,073 --> 00:17:42,973
Okay.

256
00:17:48,848 --> 00:17:51,681
Thanks.

257
00:18:01,761 --> 00:18:04,355
So, you guys had fun last night?

258
00:18:04,463 --> 00:18:06,226
So high.

259
00:18:06,532 --> 00:18:10,366
I'd never seen that look on Kevin's
face until you walked in the door.

260
00:18:10,469 --> 00:18:11,834
What look was that?

261
00:18:11,937 --> 00:18:13,370
Joy.

262
00:18:14,173 --> 00:18:16,664
That was just stoner anticipation.

263
00:18:17,243 --> 00:18:19,404
I don't think so.

264
00:18:19,812 --> 00:18:22,781
Are you fucking my boyfriend?

265
00:18:23,215 --> 00:18:24,273
No!

266
00:18:27,486 --> 00:18:28,919
You have a girl back East?

267
00:18:29,021 --> 00:18:31,785
<i>Nothing serious. Just...</i>

268
00:18:31,891 --> 00:18:33,950
I don't know.
No one that makes me--

269
00:18:34,059 --> 00:18:35,856
Horny?

270
00:18:36,028 --> 00:18:38,963
Happy? Hungry?

271
00:18:42,067 --> 00:18:44,900
No. Plenty of that.

272
00:18:45,671 --> 00:18:48,105
I don't know.

273
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,266
<i>No one that makes me...</i>

274
00:18:51,377 --> 00:18:53,106
<i>...vibrate, I guess. </i>

275
00:18:53,212 --> 00:18:54,509
Vibrate?

276
00:18:54,613 --> 00:18:56,547
You know,
when you're with someone,

277
00:18:56,715 --> 00:19:00,173
you just want to be filled up
with this, this energy,

278
00:19:00,286 --> 00:19:03,744
<i>you know, you just want to...</i>

279
00:19:03,856 --> 00:19:04,788
<i>I don't know. </i>

280
00:19:05,424 --> 00:19:07,051
You gotta vibrate.

281
00:19:07,159 --> 00:19:09,684
I guess.

282
00:19:09,962 --> 00:19:13,090
I know. I don't bullshit, right?

283
00:19:13,332 --> 00:19:15,664
Not at all.

284
00:19:21,974 --> 00:19:24,169
So, how long have you
and Kevin been going out?

285
00:19:24,276 --> 00:19:26,073
9 months.

286
00:19:26,178 --> 00:19:28,772
That's got to be a record for him.

287
00:19:28,881 --> 00:19:30,143
Me, too.

288
00:19:30,316 --> 00:19:31,476
So, what's he calling the new band?

289
00:19:33,285 --> 00:19:35,446
Brookhaven Three.

290
00:19:35,554 --> 00:19:37,351
Aren't there 4 people in his band?

291
00:19:37,456 --> 00:19:39,617
I don't know. I don't get it, either.

292
00:19:40,192 --> 00:19:42,490
Well, I'm glad to see
he's still playing.

293
00:19:42,661 --> 00:19:44,959
Yeah, they sound
pretty good, actually.

294
00:19:45,064 --> 00:19:46,224
But don't tell him I said that,

295
00:19:46,332 --> 00:19:49,893
because I'm trying really hard
to appear apathetic.

296
00:19:50,135 --> 00:19:52,569
We were in a band in high school.
Did he tell you that?

297
00:19:53,672 --> 00:19:56,835
Dude, up until the other day,
I didn't even know you existed.

298
00:19:59,645 --> 00:20:02,910
Well, we sucked. I sucked.

299
00:20:03,015 --> 00:20:06,041
- Really?
- Yeah, believe me.

300
00:20:06,619 --> 00:20:09,019
I do.

301
00:20:33,445 --> 00:20:36,175
Stop. Dude, stop.
Jacob, stop! What, are you deaf?

302
00:20:37,349 --> 00:20:38,680
Dude, are you fucking deaf?

303
00:20:38,784 --> 00:20:40,012
I'm sorry.

304
00:20:40,386 --> 00:20:42,251
Fuck.

305
00:20:43,689 --> 00:20:44,519
Well?

306
00:20:45,724 --> 00:20:47,282
That sucked.

307
00:20:47,459 --> 00:20:48,448
Yeah, I know, dude.
It's our second go at it.

308
00:20:48,561 --> 00:20:51,029
We'd be better if our fucking drummer
could keep up with the beat.

309
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:52,256
You guys know any covers?

310
00:20:52,364 --> 00:20:54,491
I mean, maybe you
could get some wedding gigs.

311
00:20:56,035 --> 00:20:57,161
Oh, keep laughing over there,
Dakota.

312
00:20:57,269 --> 00:21:01,933
You'll be laughing real hard
when I'm balls deep in groupies!

313
00:21:02,374 --> 00:21:04,808
- Oh, we got a show on Sunday.
- I'll be there.

314
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:08,471
Fuck, yeah, you'll be there. You guys
want to hear some better shit?

315
00:21:08,647 --> 00:21:12,242
- Do you have anything better?
- Fuck you. Say yes.

316
00:21:12,418 --> 00:21:15,080
All right, bitches. Try to keep up.
That means you.

317
00:21:27,733 --> 00:21:31,260
<i>"Dearest Dakota,
at the conference until Friday. </i>

318
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:36,239
<i>There's cash in the usual spot,
and I love you. Mom. "</i>

319
00:21:38,477 --> 00:21:43,505
- What are you gonna get?
- I don't know yet.

320
00:21:43,616 --> 00:21:46,346
I don't know what I want.

321
00:21:46,452 --> 00:21:47,885
You're gonna get
the chili cheeseburger plate

322
00:21:47,987 --> 00:21:50,478
and the vanilla Coke --
that's what you always get.

323
00:21:50,589 --> 00:21:51,578
That's not true.

324
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:52,588
Yes, it is.

325
00:21:52,691 --> 00:21:54,283
You always think you're
gonna get something different,

326
00:21:54,393 --> 00:21:56,327
but when Heather
comes over here you still say

327
00:21:56,428 --> 00:21:59,397
"chili cheeseburger plate
and a vanilla Coke"-- every time.

328
00:21:59,498 --> 00:22:02,399
Well, maybe tonight
I'll get something different.

329
00:22:02,501 --> 00:22:05,163
<i>I used to love this place...</i>

330
00:22:06,138 --> 00:22:08,868
<i>more than my own home. </i>

331
00:22:09,274 --> 00:22:10,764
You guys still like it here?

332
00:22:11,744 --> 00:22:13,803
Dude, it's Jim's.

333
00:22:13,979 --> 00:22:15,344
You?

334
00:22:15,881 --> 00:22:17,712
Yeah, sure, I guess.

335
00:22:17,883 --> 00:22:19,942
I don't know, man.

336
00:22:20,753 --> 00:22:22,448
You can't even smoke here anymore.

337
00:22:22,554 --> 00:22:25,022
Hey, kids.
You're eating with us tonight?

338
00:22:25,124 --> 00:22:27,319
Yeah, I want hash browns.

339
00:22:27,426 --> 00:22:29,360
And a chocolate shake.

340
00:22:29,461 --> 00:22:32,658
And how about you, special guy?
Chili cheeseburger? Vanilla Coke?

341
00:22:32,765 --> 00:22:35,563
- Uh, yeah.
- Amazing.

342
00:22:36,835 --> 00:22:38,826
- De Niro?
- Biscuits and gravy.

343
00:22:39,705 --> 00:22:42,799
- Can I get a fill-up on the coffee?
- Absolutely. Be right back.

344
00:22:42,975 --> 00:22:44,966
Thank you, Heather.

345
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:47,938
Love that girl.

346
00:22:54,019 --> 00:22:55,213
Good night.

347
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:55,945
Good night, Dakota.

348
00:22:56,055 --> 00:22:58,421
<i>Good night, uh...</i>

349
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:15,664
<i>Okay, Skye, there's got to be
a logical explanation. </i>

350
00:23:15,774 --> 00:23:17,469
<i>So, he hasn't lied once</i>

351
00:23:17,576 --> 00:23:20,602
<i>In the 2 days
that you've known him. </i>

352
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:27,047
<i>This doesn't mean anything. </i>

353
00:23:27,219 --> 00:23:28,743
<i>He'll lie soon enough. </i>

354
00:23:28,854 --> 00:23:32,381
<i>I'm sure he's just like the rest of us. </i>

355
00:23:38,363 --> 00:23:41,264
Ambulatory is to Mobile
as Fruitful is to:

356
00:23:41,366 --> 00:23:46,201
Nefarious, Fertile, Munificent,
or Pernurious?

357
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:50,474
Fertile!

358
00:23:50,909 --> 00:23:53,139
<i>Good. Okay, Dakota...</i>

359
00:23:54,413 --> 00:23:57,405
intrepid is to Valorous
as Multitudinous is to:

360
00:23:57,516 --> 00:24:00,485
Prostrate, Flagrant,
Plethoric, or Static?

361
00:24:00,586 --> 00:24:04,579
- Are you speaking English?
- Come on. Try it.

362
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:06,817
I don't know any of those words.

363
00:24:07,259 --> 00:24:10,422
Okay. Well, just think
of their relation to each other.

364
00:24:10,529 --> 00:24:15,432
<i>Intrepid is to Valorous
as Multitudinous is to...</i>

365
00:24:16,401 --> 00:24:17,732
"B. "

366
00:24:20,105 --> 00:24:21,902
No, sorry. It's "C. "

367
00:24:23,609 --> 00:24:26,601
Damn it all to hell!
I'm not fit to live among men!

368
00:24:26,712 --> 00:24:28,680
Dakota, you just
have to try and study--

369
00:24:28,781 --> 00:24:30,772
Um, maybe we should
take a break, okay,

370
00:24:30,883 --> 00:24:33,147
and we'll pick this back up
at Denise's later.

371
00:24:33,619 --> 00:24:35,849
Thank Christ.

372
00:24:39,992 --> 00:24:42,085
<i>I want to touch
I want to kiss</i>

373
00:24:42,261 --> 00:24:44,456
<i>I want to feel so close to this</i>

374
00:24:44,563 --> 00:24:48,124
<i>Is there any way
That someone could feel the same</i>

375
00:24:48,233 --> 00:24:52,693
<i>If I promised them everything...</i>

376
00:24:54,606 --> 00:24:56,597
You look like shit.

377
00:24:59,211 --> 00:25:02,977
- Yeah. I'm okay.
- What did you guys do last night?

378
00:25:03,081 --> 00:25:05,015
Just fucked around.

379
00:25:05,117 --> 00:25:09,451
Smoked a little pot, went to Noel's,
played some video games, whatever.

380
00:25:09,555 --> 00:25:13,423
We were just hung out and
stayed there last night, you know?

381
00:25:13,525 --> 00:25:14,287
His floor is, like,

382
00:25:14,393 --> 00:25:15,724
crazy uncomfortable, though.

383
00:25:15,828 --> 00:25:17,796
It sucks.

384
00:25:17,896 --> 00:25:20,922
Wow, that sounds like a lot of fun.

385
00:25:24,403 --> 00:25:26,735
Whatever.

386
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:32,576
Hey, I can't stay out late
tonight, all right? I got to study.

387
00:25:35,914 --> 00:25:38,439
That's cool.

388
00:25:49,828 --> 00:25:52,319
<i>Fuck this.
Time to get this guy to lie. </i>

389
00:25:53,465 --> 00:25:57,629
So, do you watch a lot of porn?

390
00:26:00,639 --> 00:26:02,504
A sizable amount, I guess.

391
00:26:02,608 --> 00:26:03,597
Why?

392
00:26:03,709 --> 00:26:05,142
'Cause I was over
at Bobby and Noel's,

393
00:26:05,244 --> 00:26:07,109
and they were watching this porn
about these Asian girls

394
00:26:07,212 --> 00:26:09,510
and a dildo that can only
be described as epic,

395
00:26:09,615 --> 00:26:11,105
and it was really gross.

396
00:26:11,283 --> 00:26:13,012
They said that they knew that, though,
that they thought that it was gross

397
00:26:13,185 --> 00:26:15,585
that they watched it
because it was funny.

398
00:26:16,021 --> 00:26:18,216
<i>- They're lying.
- No shit. </i>

399
00:26:18,323 --> 00:26:19,483
Really?

400
00:26:19,591 --> 00:26:22,059
Porn is purely functional.
It's not entertainment.

401
00:26:22,527 --> 00:26:23,858
It's functional?

402
00:26:24,196 --> 00:26:26,994
Yeah, porn has a singular purpose
in its existence.

403
00:26:27,099 --> 00:26:30,694
It's a tool, an aid, a catalyst
in the act of pleasuring yourself.

404
00:26:32,437 --> 00:26:34,268
Jerking off for guys is so casual.

405
00:26:34,439 --> 00:26:36,805
It's like, you know, we don't
want to be bogged down

406
00:26:36,909 --> 00:26:39,207
coming up with some sort
of scenario or something.

407
00:26:39,311 --> 00:26:42,007
Pop in a video, open a magazine,
stream it online --

408
00:26:42,114 --> 00:26:45,606
bam, done,
on with the rest of your day.

409
00:26:47,019 --> 00:26:48,145
- What?
- Nothing.

410
00:26:48,253 --> 00:26:49,447
So, how often do you do this?

411
00:26:49,554 --> 00:26:52,022
- Lots.
- Oh.

412
00:26:52,257 --> 00:26:54,418
Who has time to be embarrassed?

413
00:27:07,439 --> 00:27:09,634
Oh, shit.

414
00:27:09,741 --> 00:27:13,142
Dude, did I play you guys
our new song yet?

415
00:27:22,287 --> 00:27:23,481
Yeah?

416
00:27:23,588 --> 00:27:27,046
<i>The son-of-a-bitch doesn't lie. </i>

417
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:32,688
<i>What kind of a guy doesn't lie?</i>

418
00:27:32,798 --> 00:27:36,529
<i>This is really starting
to get on my nerves. </i>

419
00:28:04,796 --> 00:28:07,492
Hey, I can have Kevin take me home.

420
00:28:07,599 --> 00:28:10,329
Not this shit again.

421
00:28:21,179 --> 00:28:22,806
What?

422
00:28:22,981 --> 00:28:24,778
Do you got anywhere to be?

423
00:28:27,219 --> 00:28:30,677
<i>Enigmatic is to inscrutable
as Surreptitious is to...</i>

424
00:28:31,656 --> 00:28:34,648
Not really. Why?

425
00:28:49,941 --> 00:28:52,375
I haven't hiked up Papago
since I was a kid.

426
00:28:59,084 --> 00:29:04,112
One time me and Kev came up here
after school, and we fell asleep,

427
00:29:04,222 --> 00:29:09,421
and then a park ranger comes,
closes the place down, right?

428
00:29:13,398 --> 00:29:15,593
I talk to much, don't I?

429
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:18,294
No, I don't mind.

430
00:29:20,038 --> 00:29:22,063
You, on the other hand,
are a woman of few words.

431
00:29:23,642 --> 00:29:25,610
No, I talk.

432
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:28,406
Yeah, but you don't say much.

433
00:29:29,314 --> 00:29:31,680
Nothing personal.

434
00:29:33,385 --> 00:29:35,410
Prove it.

435
00:29:36,955 --> 00:29:40,948
Passions, goals, turn-ons, turn-offs?

436
00:29:41,793 --> 00:29:44,091
All right.

437
00:29:45,063 --> 00:29:52,993
My turn-ons are cigarettes,'70s punk,
boys with rings in their lips,

438
00:29:53,105 --> 00:29:57,007
and long, pointless walks up rocks.

439
00:29:59,744 --> 00:30:02,304
3 for 4.

440
00:30:03,849 --> 00:30:05,180
Turn-offs?

441
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:07,584
Pretty much everything else.

442
00:30:08,987 --> 00:30:11,512
Yeah, I get that.

443
00:30:12,023 --> 00:30:13,422
Give me an example.

444
00:30:20,999 --> 00:30:22,990
Here, I got one.

445
00:30:23,535 --> 00:30:26,504
All my friends can talk about
are the S.A.T.'s, right?

446
00:30:26,605 --> 00:30:28,596
About "college is this"
and "my future that. "

447
00:30:28,707 --> 00:30:32,404
I mean, fucking shit, like,
do I really have to go to college?

448
00:30:32,511 --> 00:30:36,072
Like, what if I want to knit
fucking baskets or fucking --

449
00:30:36,181 --> 00:30:38,046
or wait tables at Jim's or something?

450
00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:40,618
I mean, do I really have
to get a higher education for that?

451
00:30:40,719 --> 00:30:43,654
Like, what degree
do you suggest I get for that?

452
00:30:43,755 --> 00:30:46,952
I mean, Jesus-fucking-Christ, man!

453
00:30:52,464 --> 00:30:53,590
Oh, shit.

454
00:30:54,099 --> 00:30:55,930
Are you, like,
a Bible nut or something?

455
00:30:56,034 --> 00:30:59,003
You can talk, can't you?

456
00:30:59,137 --> 00:31:01,970
<i>Yeah, well...</i>

457
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,800
<i>...it sucks. </i>

458
00:31:05,177 --> 00:31:07,839
It does suck.

459
00:31:09,648 --> 00:31:11,275
What did you get on your S.A.T.'s?

460
00:31:11,383 --> 00:31:14,875
<i>- Like 1350 or something.
- Oh, my God!</i>

461
00:31:14,986 --> 00:31:18,717
- Honest.
- I believe you.

462
00:31:18,823 --> 00:31:20,984
All right. Come on.

463
00:32:19,217 --> 00:32:21,811
Are you hung over today?

464
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,912
I was this morning.

465
00:32:24,623 --> 00:32:26,682
Really? What did you guys
do last night?

466
00:32:27,626 --> 00:32:30,026
Got real high and went to a bar.

467
00:32:31,296 --> 00:32:33,321
That's it?

468
00:32:37,168 --> 00:32:38,601
Talked to a couple of girls
who blew us off

469
00:32:38,703 --> 00:32:43,163
for these Abercrombie-model dudes
who said they had coke.

470
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:46,543
Now, don't worry.

471
00:32:46,645 --> 00:32:48,340
Kev was a good boy.

472
00:32:48,713 --> 00:32:50,374
<i>No, he...</i>

473
00:32:50,482 --> 00:32:53,246
He can talk to who he likes.

474
00:32:54,319 --> 00:32:56,879
Sure.

475
00:32:57,656 --> 00:32:59,590
He played me the demo.
It was good.

476
00:32:59,691 --> 00:33:01,249
Yeah, it's really good.

477
00:33:01,359 --> 00:33:04,294
It was good the first time I heard it.
It was good the hundredth.

478
00:33:05,163 --> 00:33:07,791
He's really proud of it.

479
00:33:07,899 --> 00:33:11,130
Almost makes me sorry
I quit our old band.

480
00:33:20,879 --> 00:33:24,076
How far down do you think that is?

481
00:33:25,583 --> 00:33:27,949
I don't know.

482
00:33:28,053 --> 00:33:29,918
Far.

483
00:33:33,224 --> 00:33:35,488
What?

484
00:33:37,095 --> 00:33:39,529
Okay. All right.

485
00:33:39,631 --> 00:33:44,898
Imagine you threw yourself
from here, all right?

486
00:33:45,003 --> 00:33:48,200
Your, your wife leaves you,
your stocks bottom out,

487
00:33:48,373 --> 00:33:50,273
Beatles break up.

488
00:33:50,375 --> 00:33:52,434
You know
that already happened, right?

489
00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:53,838
Yeah, whatever.

490
00:33:53,945 --> 00:33:56,140
So, imagine you take it
upon yourself to jump.

491
00:33:56,247 --> 00:33:57,680
Okay.

492
00:33:57,782 --> 00:34:02,481
On the way down, which way
would you rather be facing?

493
00:34:04,723 --> 00:34:06,315
You're a weird guy.

494
00:34:06,758 --> 00:34:08,248
I get that.

495
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:11,796
No, but really, I mean, would you
rather be looking back up at the sky,

496
00:34:12,397 --> 00:34:15,696
no idea when the end is gonna hit?

497
00:34:16,534 --> 00:34:18,832
Or would you rather go face-first,

498
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:21,561
aware of the moment
when everything cuts to black,

499
00:34:22,407 --> 00:34:28,175
knowing that this second
is your last?

500
00:34:30,115 --> 00:34:31,844
Face-up.

501
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:33,549
Face-up?

502
00:34:33,651 --> 00:34:36,882
Yeah, just kick back
and enjoy the ride.

503
00:34:38,289 --> 00:34:41,258
I'd want to see it coming.

504
00:34:42,394 --> 00:34:46,057
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I'd want to see it coming.

505
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:30,400
Thanks for the ride.

506
00:35:30,508 --> 00:35:35,002
<i>You ever get the urge to just. . .
get in the car and drive?</i>

507
00:35:35,113 --> 00:35:36,478
I mean, nowhere in particular,

508
00:35:36,581 --> 00:35:38,446
just to take control of your life
for a moment?

509
00:35:38,716 --> 00:35:40,650
You know, to make a choice,

510
00:35:40,752 --> 00:35:43,346
even if that choice
is to not make a choice?

511
00:35:45,356 --> 00:35:47,586
I don't drive.

512
00:35:49,394 --> 00:35:52,386
- Right.
- Good night.

513
00:35:52,497 --> 00:35:53,657
'Night!

514
00:36:01,706 --> 00:36:04,038
- Hey, Dakota?
- What?

515
00:36:05,577 --> 00:36:06,236
Never mind.

516
00:36:06,344 --> 00:36:08,278
Come on! I hate that!
I really hate that!

517
00:36:08,379 --> 00:36:09,812
I hate it when guys do that!

518
00:36:09,914 --> 00:36:11,506
They want you to know
they want to say something,

519
00:36:11,616 --> 00:36:13,277
but they're too afraid
to actually say it,

520
00:36:13,384 --> 00:36:15,409
and then try to bait you
to ask them!

521
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,750
- I'm sorry.
- Do you wanna say something, Jonah?

522
00:36:20,925 --> 00:36:23,951
Yes.

523
00:36:24,329 --> 00:36:26,797
What is it, then?

524
00:36:29,133 --> 00:36:32,000
Well, what is it?

525
00:36:38,343 --> 00:36:41,403
I can't tell you.

526
00:36:41,913 --> 00:36:43,881
Why not?

527
00:36:46,985 --> 00:36:49,715
- Because I can't.
- Ugh, fine!

528
00:36:49,821 --> 00:36:52,949
I want to tell you that I like you.

529
00:36:53,925 --> 00:36:57,452
But I can't tell you that, can I?

530
00:37:03,001 --> 00:37:06,493
I want to tell you to forget about him.

531
00:37:07,005 --> 00:37:09,997
He's a great guy, the best,

532
00:37:10,108 --> 00:37:11,234
and he's my brother
in everything but blood,

533
00:37:11,342 --> 00:37:13,105
and you two are good together,
but I still want to tell you

534
00:37:13,211 --> 00:37:15,008
to tell him to fuck off
and to be with me.

535
00:37:15,947 --> 00:37:20,714
I want to tell you
that since the moment I met you

536
00:37:20,818 --> 00:37:24,345
I can't even get your face
out of my brain.

537
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:28,590
But I can't tell you that,

538
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:32,321
that all I want right now
in the world

539
00:37:32,830 --> 00:37:34,798
is to take you away with me.

540
00:37:34,899 --> 00:37:38,892
No him, no here, no this.

541
00:37:39,003 --> 00:37:41,563
Just us.

542
00:37:43,308 --> 00:37:47,904
If just for a day. You know?

543
00:37:54,352 --> 00:37:57,014
But I can't tell you that.

544
00:37:57,121 --> 00:37:59,146
I mean, you can't make me.

545
00:38:02,293 --> 00:38:04,227
I mean, what kind
of a person would I be

546
00:38:04,329 --> 00:38:07,355
if I went and told you
something like that?

547
00:38:16,107 --> 00:38:18,905
<i>I'd appreciate it if...</i>

548
00:38:19,177 --> 00:38:23,170
<i>...if you didn't tell Kevin
what I didn't say. </i>

549
00:38:26,584 --> 00:38:29,553
<i>Of course not, because. . .
you didn't say it. </i>

550
00:38:30,421 --> 00:38:32,116
No.

551
00:38:32,457 --> 00:38:34,789
No, I didn't.

552
00:38:37,095 --> 00:38:38,289
Good night.

553
00:38:41,199 --> 00:38:43,565
Good night, Dakota.

554
00:39:16,034 --> 00:39:18,730
<i>Who does he think he Is
saying those things,</i>

555
00:39:18,836 --> 00:39:21,270
<i>or "not" saying those things?</i>

556
00:39:21,372 --> 00:39:24,341
<i>Seriously, who does
something like that?</i>

557
00:39:24,442 --> 00:39:27,673
<i>Does he think he can just
make up some speech</i>

558
00:39:27,779 --> 00:39:30,839
<i>that I'm sure he's practiced
over and over again in the shower</i>

559
00:39:30,948 --> 00:39:34,941
<i>and I would just -- I would just...?</i>

560
00:39:37,922 --> 00:39:41,858
<i>Seriously, who does
something like that?</i>

561
00:39:57,475 --> 00:40:00,672
- So, you ditched us again last night.
- Yeah, I guess I did.

562
00:40:00,845 --> 00:40:02,540
Denise almost had a fit.

563
00:40:02,647 --> 00:40:06,413
Denise is to annoying
as Dakota is to doesn't give a fuck.

564
00:40:06,517 --> 00:40:09,509
- We were worried.
- What, Mom, am I grounded?

565
00:40:09,787 --> 00:40:11,015
Jesus Christ, you can be

566
00:40:11,122 --> 00:40:12,180
a mean little bitch.

567
00:40:13,357 --> 00:40:14,722
What?

568
00:40:16,427 --> 00:40:18,918
I mean, honestly,
we're just trying to help, and--

569
00:40:19,097 --> 00:40:20,997
Yeah, I know that. I'm sorry.

570
00:40:21,165 --> 00:40:23,895
What makes you think that you're
so much better than the rest of us?

571
00:40:24,602 --> 00:40:28,061
<i>The key dilemma
in any young superhero's life-- </i>

572
00:40:28,172 --> 00:40:30,436
<i>Does she reveal
her identity to the world</i>

573
00:40:30,541 --> 00:40:31,906
<i>or does she keep it a secret,</i>

574
00:40:32,009 --> 00:40:35,274
<i>assuring her security
but also her alienation?</i>

575
00:40:35,379 --> 00:40:36,607
Hello?

576
00:40:38,416 --> 00:40:39,440
Look, I don't know, all right?

577
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:42,519
You're just-- you're way
ahead of me, that's all.

578
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:45,589
<i>I don't...I don't think
about the future much. </i>

579
00:40:45,757 --> 00:40:47,088
Why not?

580
00:40:47,258 --> 00:40:50,386
<i>Because...there's
nothing I can do about it. </i>

581
00:40:50,495 --> 00:40:53,692
There's nothing you can do about it.
It is what it is.

582
00:40:53,798 --> 00:40:57,029
I don't know why I even
bother with you anymore.

583
00:40:57,135 --> 00:41:00,434
Because in the 3rd grade we made
each other friendship bracelets.

584
00:41:08,679 --> 00:41:13,343
<i>You'd be surprised how much
this stuff is actually true. </i>

585
00:41:14,051 --> 00:41:17,111
Say you were gonna jump
off of a building, all right?

586
00:41:17,488 --> 00:41:18,477
I'm sorry, why would I do that?

587
00:41:18,589 --> 00:41:21,922
Just imagine that you're gonna
jump off of a building, okay?

588
00:41:22,026 --> 00:41:23,926
No. Why would I do that?

589
00:41:24,028 --> 00:41:26,394
I don't know. Whatever.
The band breaks up.

590
00:41:26,564 --> 00:41:28,498
We've broken up,
like, a thousand times.

591
00:41:28,599 --> 00:41:31,762
- Okay, maybe I break up with you.
- Well, that's not gonna happen.

592
00:41:33,738 --> 00:41:36,764
Say it was your dick
in a motorcycle accident.

593
00:41:37,275 --> 00:41:38,833
Yeah.

594
00:41:38,943 --> 00:41:39,807
Okay, I'm with you. Shoot.

595
00:41:39,911 --> 00:41:42,345
All right. So, you're gonna jump.

596
00:41:42,446 --> 00:41:47,145
Would you rather land
face-down or face-up?

597
00:41:48,352 --> 00:41:49,250
What does it matter?
Dead is dead.

598
00:41:49,353 --> 00:41:51,412
- God, does it have to be my dick?
- But it does matter.

599
00:41:51,589 --> 00:41:53,614
Face-down, you're facing the end,

600
00:41:53,724 --> 00:41:56,249
you'll know the exact moment
that you're gonna hit the ground.

601
00:41:56,427 --> 00:42:00,796
Face-up, though, you can just
kick back and enjoy the ride,

602
00:42:00,898 --> 00:42:03,298
enjoy it while it lasts,
and let the end sneak up on you.

603
00:42:06,003 --> 00:42:07,265
Face-up.

604
00:42:08,039 --> 00:42:09,666
Face-up?

605
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:18,971
Wow, you're really, like,
fucking up my high.

606
00:42:19,083 --> 00:42:21,051
It's, like, whoa!

607
00:42:21,385 --> 00:42:24,081
- I'm sorry.
- That's okay.

608
00:42:24,188 --> 00:42:26,383
- Want some?
- No!

609
00:42:26,490 --> 00:42:27,980
Sorry.

610
00:42:36,734 --> 00:42:38,031
No!

611
00:42:39,604 --> 00:42:40,764
No!

612
00:42:57,355 --> 00:42:58,344
Hello?

613
00:42:58,990 --> 00:43:00,184
Hey.

614
00:43:02,593 --> 00:43:03,651
Hi.

615
00:43:04,629 --> 00:43:06,494
<i>Um...</i>

616
00:43:07,231 --> 00:43:08,562
Come over.

617
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:11,762
- No.
- No?! What do you mean "no"?

618
00:43:11,936 --> 00:43:13,096
I mean no.

619
00:43:13,271 --> 00:43:14,363
- First you're--
- Listen, there are rules.

620
00:43:14,472 --> 00:43:16,838
<i>- I can't just--
- And now you're just gonna...?</i>

621
00:43:16,941 --> 00:43:19,239
Oh, wow.
Okay, whatever. That's fine.

622
00:43:19,343 --> 00:43:21,174
No.

623
00:43:21,279 --> 00:43:23,611
No, no, no!

624
00:43:31,489 --> 00:43:33,457
I'll be there in 10 minutes.

625
00:44:34,485 --> 00:44:36,715
Drive.

626
00:44:38,055 --> 00:44:40,717
I said "drive. "

627
00:44:41,726 --> 00:44:47,358
<i>- Where?
- I don't care where. Just...far away. </i>

629
00:44:58,509 --> 00:45:03,037
<i>Let me be that love</i>

630
00:45:03,147 --> 00:45:08,016
<i>If you have lots of others</i>

631
00:45:08,185 --> 00:45:10,346
<i>Please let me be</i>

632
00:45:10,454 --> 00:45:15,482
<i>Please let me be one</i>

633
00:45:15,726 --> 00:45:20,254
<i>Let me be one</i>

634
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:26,866
<i>If you like undressing</i>

635
00:45:26,971 --> 00:45:31,305
<i>Please let me find out</i>

636
00:45:31,409 --> 00:45:36,312
<i>If you like large intestines</i>

637
00:45:36,414 --> 00:45:38,609
<i>Please let me find</i>

638
00:45:38,716 --> 00:45:43,983
<i>Please, please, please
Let me find out</i>

639
00:45:44,088 --> 00:45:50,391
<i>Let me find out</i>

640
00:45:50,494 --> 00:45:55,488
<i>Or if you're gone
For weeks on end</i>

641
00:45:55,599 --> 00:45:59,899
<i>Crazy situations</i>

642
00:46:00,004 --> 00:46:04,873
<i>And don't know
Why you drive through cars</i>

643
00:46:04,975 --> 00:46:09,503
<i>In dirty, foreign towns</i>

644
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:15,619
<i>Please let me find out</i>

645
00:46:16,887 --> 00:46:20,846
<i>If you shield your eyes</i>

646
00:46:20,958 --> 00:46:25,395
<i>For glory every time</i>

647
00:46:25,496 --> 00:46:29,762
<i>And drag your mouth to smile</i>

648
00:46:29,867 --> 00:46:35,271
<i>And sickness is your cover...</i>

649
00:46:40,411 --> 00:46:42,879
Why did we stop?

650
00:46:42,980 --> 00:46:47,007
Couldn't drive any further.

651
00:47:07,171 --> 00:47:10,231
That's a big fuckin' hole.

652
00:47:10,341 --> 00:47:13,606
That's a Grand fuckin' hole.

653
00:47:35,466 --> 00:47:39,527
We always find ourselves
looking down on things.

654
00:47:39,837 --> 00:47:42,237
I think that's a thing for us.

655
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:44,835
Why is that?

656
00:47:44,942 --> 00:47:49,208
Well, it's our obvious superiority
above all others.

657
00:48:04,695 --> 00:48:07,129
- Sorry.
- For what?

658
00:48:07,998 --> 00:48:10,933
I don't know if that
was the right thing to do.

659
00:48:11,035 --> 00:48:13,799
In fact, I know that was not
the right thing to do,

660
00:48:13,904 --> 00:48:17,738
but I wanted to, anyway.

661
00:48:18,976 --> 00:48:21,308
What are we gonna do?

662
00:48:22,346 --> 00:48:24,041
I don't know.
This is pretty bad.

663
00:48:24,148 --> 00:48:27,914
- This is so bad.
- Yeah.

664
00:48:28,452 --> 00:48:31,785
- I just feel like--
- I know.

665
00:48:34,592 --> 00:48:36,025
Hey, how about this?

666
00:48:36,126 --> 00:48:40,290
How about let's just pretend
like this is all a dream, okay?

667
00:48:40,397 --> 00:48:41,056
Okay.

668
00:48:41,165 --> 00:48:43,463
And nothing that we say or do
counts in the waking world,

669
00:48:43,567 --> 00:48:46,832
and out there, I mean,
we might be horrible people,

670
00:48:46,937 --> 00:48:54,434
but right here in our dream,
you and me, this is all okay.

671
00:48:54,578 --> 00:48:58,537
- Just for today.
- Just for right here and right now.

672
00:48:59,683 --> 00:49:02,049
You know, eventually we're gonna
have to wake up from this dream.

673
00:49:02,219 --> 00:49:04,585
Yeah, but not right now.

674
00:49:11,829 --> 00:49:14,696
Not for a little while, anyway.

675
00:50:47,725 --> 00:50:51,183
<i>So, I think I'm falling in love. </i>

676
00:50:51,295 --> 00:50:53,786
<i>involuntarily blessed with something</i>

677
00:50:53,897 --> 00:50:58,334
<i>people spend their entire lives
searching for. </i>

678
00:50:58,969 --> 00:51:01,699
<i>Lucky me. </i>

679
00:51:07,211 --> 00:51:09,236
Are you tired?

680
00:51:09,747 --> 00:51:12,443
Tell me again why you don't drive.

681
00:51:12,549 --> 00:51:15,416
Uh, I don't have a license.

682
00:51:15,519 --> 00:51:17,009
Why not?

683
00:51:17,121 --> 00:51:20,750
Because I always had a ride.

684
00:51:20,991 --> 00:51:23,983
<i>And you don't have
a cell phone because...?</i>

685
00:51:24,094 --> 00:51:25,652
Somebody might call it.

686
00:51:32,069 --> 00:51:35,095
You know, something
just occurred to me.

687
00:51:35,339 --> 00:51:38,604
We've been gone almost 2 4 hours.
Aren't your parents gonna freak?

688
00:51:40,210 --> 00:51:42,405
My mom's out of town.

689
00:51:42,513 --> 00:51:44,481
And your dad?

690
00:51:44,581 --> 00:51:51,009
<i>My dad died when I was little, so. . .
I think we're in the clear. </i>

691
00:51:52,790 --> 00:51:54,451
I'm sorry.

692
00:51:54,558 --> 00:51:56,526
It's okay.

693
00:51:56,627 --> 00:51:59,619
It's cancer. It happens.

694
00:52:00,631 --> 00:52:01,598
I guess--

695
00:52:01,698 --> 00:52:03,393
If you say "I guess
that explains a few things",

696
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:06,128
you lose a testicle.

697
00:52:06,637 --> 00:52:07,433
I wasn't gonna say--

698
00:52:07,538 --> 00:52:10,371
I don't date older guys
looking for Daddy.

699
00:52:10,474 --> 00:52:12,669
I don't. I'm not looking
for a father figure.

700
00:52:12,776 --> 00:52:16,371
I have a dad.
He's just not here anymore.

701
00:52:17,848 --> 00:52:19,281
That would have really
put me in my place

702
00:52:19,383 --> 00:52:22,113
if I would have said anything.

703
00:52:23,454 --> 00:52:25,786
<i>I'm sorry. I just...</i>

704
00:52:26,790 --> 00:52:29,190
<i>Kevin just always...</i>

705
00:52:31,228 --> 00:52:33,526
Never mind.

706
00:52:56,453 --> 00:52:58,512
Told you.

707
00:53:02,693 --> 00:53:07,221
- You want the tour?
- Yeah.

708
00:53:08,999 --> 00:53:16,462
<i>Kitchen, dining room,
den, living room...</i>

709
00:53:16,573 --> 00:53:18,302
Hold on. Follow me.

710
00:53:18,475 --> 00:53:20,841
Hallway.

711
00:53:23,981 --> 00:53:30,011
Oh, goodness! My room!
How did we get in here?

712
00:54:12,296 --> 00:54:13,888
Do we have to wake up yet?

713
00:54:46,063 --> 00:54:50,022
- I can't do this.
- But we already are.

714
00:54:50,133 --> 00:54:51,998
We can't.

715
00:54:52,302 --> 00:54:57,638
- I know, but I want to.
- Oh, God. So do I.

716
00:54:59,176 --> 00:55:02,737
- We can't.
- We can't.

717
00:55:28,839 --> 00:55:29,828
Hello?

718
00:55:29,940 --> 00:55:31,305
<i>Hey, where have you been all day?</i>

719
00:55:31,408 --> 00:55:33,171
I've been studying at Denise's.

720
00:55:33,343 --> 00:55:34,970
You comin'?

721
00:55:35,512 --> 00:55:36,444
What?

722
00:55:36,546 --> 00:55:38,207
<i>What do you mean, "what"?
To the show. Hello?</i>

723
00:55:38,315 --> 00:55:40,283
Oh, yeah! Of course!

724
00:55:40,450 --> 00:55:41,508
Fuck, yeah, of course.
Can you do me a favor?

725
00:55:41,618 --> 00:55:43,518
<i>- Yeah, sure.
- Do you have Jonah's number?</i>

726
00:55:43,620 --> 00:55:45,815
Yeah, yeah. I got it somewhere.

727
00:55:45,922 --> 00:55:48,390
<i>All right, well, could you
give him a call for me, then?</i>

728
00:55:48,492 --> 00:55:49,481
Okay.

729
00:55:49,660 --> 00:55:50,786
All right. Cool. Well, hook up
a ride with him to get here,

730
00:55:50,894 --> 00:55:53,988
- because I'm already at the show.
- Okay. Bye.

731
00:56:05,976 --> 00:56:08,843
I guess it's time to wake up.

732
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:11,347
Yeah.

733
00:56:17,354 --> 00:56:20,221
<i>My heart beats more slowly</i>

734
00:56:20,323 --> 00:56:22,791
<i>But you're not here to hold me</i>

735
00:56:22,893 --> 00:56:26,192
<i>Baby, it can be so lonely</i>

736
00:56:26,363 --> 00:56:29,161
<i>Is it any wonder why I love you</i>

737
00:56:29,332 --> 00:56:32,267
<i>You're beautiful, so beautiful</i>

738
00:56:32,602 --> 00:56:35,264
<i>They're jealous, so jealous</i>

739
00:56:35,439 --> 00:56:38,067
<i>You're beautiful, just beautiful</i>

740
00:56:38,241 --> 00:56:41,836
<i>Is it any wonder why I love you</i>

741
00:57:04,801 --> 00:57:07,326
<i>My heart beats more slowly</i>

742
00:57:07,571 --> 00:57:10,597
<i>But you're not here to hold me</i>

743
00:57:10,707 --> 00:57:13,540
<i>Baby, it can be so lonely</i>

744
00:57:13,643 --> 00:57:16,544
<i>Is it any wonder why I love you</i>

745
00:57:16,646 --> 00:57:19,171
<i>Oh my heart beats more slowly</i>

746
00:57:19,282 --> 00:57:22,547
<i>But you're not here to hold me</i>

747
00:57:22,652 --> 00:57:25,212
<i>Baby, it can be so lonely</i>

748
00:57:25,322 --> 00:57:28,416
<i>Is it any wonder why I love you</i>

749
00:57:28,592 --> 00:57:31,527
<i>You're beautiful, so beautiful</i>

750
00:57:31,628 --> 00:57:34,620
<i>They're jealous, so jealous</i>

751
00:57:34,731 --> 00:57:37,461
<i>You're beautiful, just beautiful</i>

752
00:57:37,634 --> 00:57:40,603
<i>Is it any wonder why I love you</i>

753
00:57:48,078 --> 00:57:50,103
Thank you, thank you.
We are Brookhaven Three

754
00:57:50,213 --> 00:57:52,078
from Scottsdale, A - Z.

755
00:57:54,251 --> 00:57:55,479
I've got a little surprise
for you guys, tonight.

756
00:57:55,585 --> 00:57:56,745
Dakota, come up on stage.

757
00:57:57,687 --> 00:57:58,483
Yeah, that's you.

758
00:57:58,588 --> 00:58:00,954
Come on. Let's go.

759
00:58:06,596 --> 00:58:07,585
I'm gonna do a cover for you guys

760
00:58:07,697 --> 00:58:08,994
of a song you probably
never heard before,

761
00:58:09,099 --> 00:58:10,794
but you're gonna hear it now,
so enjoy it.

762
00:58:10,901 --> 00:58:11,663
<i>Jake...</i>

763
00:58:23,180 --> 00:58:27,981
<i>Some days I feel affected</i>

764
00:58:28,084 --> 00:58:33,181
<i>And it all disappears</i>

765
00:58:33,757 --> 00:58:38,592
<i>The rain and clouds
Above my head</i>

766

<i>Breathe as two
But think as one</i>

777

01:00:54,197 --> 01:00:57,963
<i>Got my list</i>

790
01:00:59,269 --> 01:01:03,000
<i>Got my list</i>

791
01:01:36,940 --> 01:01:38,430
Well?

792
01:01:38,742 --> 01:01:41,210
What can I say?
Motherfucking rock star.

793
01:01:41,311 --> 01:01:43,074
Fucking straight, dude.

794
01:01:43,179 --> 01:01:44,612
We're out.

795
01:01:44,714 --> 01:01:46,341
You guys did a really great show.

796
01:01:46,449 --> 01:01:48,314
Peace, brother-man.

797
01:01:48,418 --> 01:01:50,249
Good show, dude.

798
01:01:57,827 --> 01:01:58,816
Jim's?

799
01:01:58,928 --> 01:02:00,418
Hell, yeah! Can you give me a ride?

800
01:02:00,530 --> 01:02:02,760
- Yeah.
- Thanks. Let's go.

801
01:02:09,973 --> 01:02:11,702
I didn't know you could sing.

802
01:02:12,776 --> 01:02:14,175
I can't.

803
01:02:14,344 --> 01:02:17,871
- Beg to differ.
- So, what were you doing today?

804
01:02:19,382 --> 01:02:20,542
I can't remember the last time
you said you were studying,

805
01:02:20,717 --> 01:02:23,481
with Denise, no less.

806
01:02:24,020 --> 01:02:28,548
- Yeah, I was studying for the S. A. T.'s.
- Oh, look at that.

807
01:02:28,658 --> 01:02:31,889
My little braniac.
What about you, punk-ass?

808
01:02:31,995 --> 01:02:33,587
I must have left you,
like, 500 messages.

809
01:02:33,797 --> 01:02:35,731
- I--
- Hi, guys. What'll it be?

810
01:02:35,832 --> 01:02:37,094
- Coffee.
- Coffee.

811
01:02:37,367 --> 01:02:38,299
Coffee.

812
01:02:38,401 --> 01:02:41,063
Well, damn. I'll get a chili
cheeseburger and a vanilla Coke.

813
01:02:41,271 --> 01:02:44,434
- Of course you will.
- Thanks.

814
01:02:44,541 --> 01:02:46,236
What were you saying?
Where were you today?

815
01:02:46,342 --> 01:02:47,866
Um, I went and I was--

816
01:02:47,977 --> 01:02:50,639
Kev, you were
so good out there tonight!

817
01:02:50,814 --> 01:02:51,803
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

818
01:02:51,915 --> 01:02:54,748
- Thanks.
- Yeah. You rocked the house, dude.

819
01:02:54,918 --> 01:02:57,716
Yeah, make you sorry
that you quit the old band?

820
01:02:57,821 --> 01:03:00,585
Oh, hell no! Don't believe
this motherfucker for a second!

821
01:03:00,690 --> 01:03:03,750
You didn't quit the band! We kicked
him out because he sucked!

822
01:03:03,860 --> 01:03:04,724
Bad?

823
01:03:04,828 --> 01:03:07,922
Bad? On a scale of 1 to 10,
he was, like, negative 142.

824
01:03:10,900 --> 01:03:13,801
I thought you said
you quit the band.

825
01:03:14,504 --> 01:03:15,994
Hey, yo, Terry!

826
01:03:16,106 --> 01:03:18,768
What kind of douche-bags
come to Jim's at 2:00 in the morning?

827
01:03:18,875 --> 01:03:21,867
This some S.A.T. study group?

828
01:03:22,479 --> 01:03:23,810
Nerd.

829
01:03:31,821 --> 01:03:34,415
- Later, guys.
- Have a good night, Terry.

830
01:03:34,524 --> 01:03:36,492
Later. 'Kota, do you need a lift?

831
01:03:36,593 --> 01:03:38,652
No, I'll take her, man.

832
01:03:38,761 --> 01:03:41,787
Um, could I get a ride home?

833
01:03:42,599 --> 01:03:45,693
Uh, yeah.

834
01:03:46,236 --> 01:03:48,704
'Night, guys.

835
01:03:58,248 --> 01:04:00,478
- Can I come inside?
- No, not tonight.

836
01:04:00,583 --> 01:04:03,780
<i>- Why? Your mom home?
- Yeah. No. I mean...</i>

837
01:04:03,887 --> 01:04:07,220
- Then, what?
- I have school in the morning!

838
01:04:07,323 --> 01:04:08,255
Oh, come on.

839
01:04:08,358 --> 01:04:11,691
I'm still so amped up
from the show, from the concert.

840
01:04:13,530 --> 01:04:14,997
Come on!

841
01:04:15,665 --> 01:04:18,225
Don't you want to fuck a rock star?

842
01:04:31,648 --> 01:04:36,517
Yeah. I hit that shit last night.

843
01:04:39,455 --> 01:04:41,047
Like I fucking care

844
01:04:41,157 --> 01:04:43,955
if I pass that stupid class.

845
01:04:47,130 --> 01:04:48,427
Just stayed home

846
01:04:48,531 --> 01:04:50,897
and played video games.

847
01:04:53,069 --> 01:04:54,502
Right now I'm really just trying

848
01:04:54,604 --> 01:04:57,539
to concentrate on my work.

849
01:05:01,244 --> 01:05:05,374
<i>Same as ever. I don't get It. </i>

850
01:05:10,186 --> 01:05:14,179
<i>He didnt quit the band.
They kicked him out. </i>

851
01:05:14,290 --> 01:05:17,259
<i>Why didnt I know that?</i>

852
01:05:17,393 --> 01:05:20,829
<i>I have to do something about this.
I can't tell when he's lying. </i>

853
01:05:20,930 --> 01:05:24,457
<i>He could have been lying
this whole time. </i>

854
01:05:27,103 --> 01:05:30,595
Hey, Chris. It's Chris, right?

855
01:05:30,707 --> 01:05:32,937
Okay.

856
01:05:33,209 --> 01:05:35,177
<i>So, I've been poring
over these things all night,</i>

857
01:05:35,278 --> 01:05:37,246
<i>and I've learned 2 things. </i>

858
01:05:37,347 --> 01:05:39,815
<i>1, despite all non-scientific knowledge,</i>

859
01:05:39,916 --> 01:05:41,884
<i>an intense dose of radiation
won't kill you. </i>

860
01:05:41,985 --> 01:05:44,715
<i>It'll just make you big
and green and cranky. </i>

861
01:05:44,821 --> 01:05:48,222
<i>And 2, every superhero
has a weakness,</i>

862
01:05:48,324 --> 01:05:51,225
<i>something that brings them down
with the rest of the mortals. </i>

863
01:05:51,327 --> 01:05:52,157
<i>Maybe that's it!</i>

864
01:05:52,262 --> 01:05:54,594
<i>Maybe Jonah is my archenemy,</i>

865
01:05:54,697 --> 01:05:57,996
<i>the one being out there
that can nullify my superpower. </i>

866
01:05:58,101 --> 01:06:00,729
<i>Has our heroine
finally met her match?</i>

867
01:06:00,837 --> 01:06:01,531
<i>Find out next month In-- </i>

868
01:06:08,678 --> 01:06:10,612
Hello.

869
01:06:21,658 --> 01:06:24,786
Take that, bitches!

870
01:06:24,894 --> 01:06:25,883
What's my score?

871
01:06:25,995 --> 01:06:27,462
140.

872
01:06:27,563 --> 01:06:28,928
And what's yours?

873
01:06:29,032 --> 01:06:30,363
56.

874
01:06:30,466 --> 01:06:32,934
God, you suck!

875
01:06:33,436 --> 01:06:36,701
Bowling's my favorite nonport.

876
01:06:40,810 --> 01:06:43,074
So, are we gonna
do this all night or what?

877
01:06:43,846 --> 01:06:45,313
Do what? Bowl?

878
01:06:46,916 --> 01:06:51,376
Not talk about this.
About the other night.

879
01:06:51,487 --> 01:06:53,478
- Yes.
- Yes, what?

880
01:06:53,589 --> 01:06:56,581
Yes, we're gonna
not talk about this all night.

881
01:06:58,695 --> 01:07:00,788
I think I'm in love with you.

882
01:07:01,030 --> 01:07:02,930
- What?!
- No, fuck that.

883
01:07:03,032 --> 01:07:06,832
I'm absolutely, positively
in love with you.

884
01:07:11,007 --> 01:07:12,941
I said I love you.

885
01:07:15,578 --> 01:07:17,205
How do I know?

886
01:07:19,449 --> 01:07:24,443
- Well, for starters, I just told you.
- Yeah, but how do I know?

887
01:07:27,890 --> 01:07:29,858
I guess you're just gonna
have to trust me.

888
01:07:30,426 --> 01:07:36,524
You see, that's it. I don't know
how to do that, trust you.

889
01:07:37,133 --> 01:07:39,567
Excuse me?

890
01:07:41,270 --> 01:07:47,607
I don't know how to do that.
That's the problem.

891
01:07:48,111 --> 01:07:51,103
I guess I thought
that I would have earned it by now.

892
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:52,406
Don't you see?
That's the problem.

893
01:07:52,515 --> 01:07:53,982
<i>I...</i>

894
01:07:57,687 --> 01:08:00,281
How do I know?

895
01:08:03,826 --> 01:08:07,227
It's really hard to explain.

896
01:08:08,598 --> 01:08:10,725
It's not that hard.

897
01:08:20,943 --> 01:08:23,434
Fucking hell.

898
01:08:44,867 --> 01:08:47,893
I've known him since I was 9.

899
01:08:48,070 --> 01:08:51,528
He used to steal the lunch money
from the kids who stole mine,

900
01:08:51,641 --> 01:08:54,667
and we'd go buy fireworks.

901
01:08:55,011 --> 01:08:57,775
First car I ever drove was his.

902
01:08:58,514 --> 01:09:01,244
Lit my first cigarette.

903
01:09:03,219 --> 01:09:06,086
Had a lot of firsts with him.

904
01:09:06,956 --> 01:09:11,791
<i>Now, it's the first time I've ever
tried to steal anyone's girlfriend, so...</i>

905
01:09:12,895 --> 01:09:16,524
<i>guess it fits that I go through
that with him, too. </i>

906
01:09:25,908 --> 01:09:28,206
Do you love him?

907
01:09:29,545 --> 01:09:31,979
I don't know.

908
01:09:36,986 --> 01:09:39,216
Do you love me?

909
01:09:41,257 --> 01:09:42,588
If I knew the answer to that,

910
01:09:42,692 --> 01:09:46,150
I'd probably know the answer
to the other.

911
01:09:51,501 --> 01:09:54,436
You're right not to trust me. Look
what I'm doing to my best friend.

912
01:09:54,537 --> 01:09:58,735
- It's not that I don't trust you, it's just--
- No, no. It's cool.

913
01:10:00,476 --> 01:10:02,808
I understand.

914
01:10:06,082 --> 01:10:08,073
Let's go.

915
01:10:09,318 --> 01:10:13,015
- Where are we going?
- Home. It's late.

916
01:10:25,301 --> 01:10:29,863
Aristocrat is to imperious
as Supplicant is to:

917
01:10:30,039 --> 01:10:34,271
Cowardly, Awkward,
Servile, or Arrogant?

918
01:10:34,443 --> 01:10:36,570
Give me the choices
one more time.

919
01:10:36,679 --> 01:10:42,675
Cowardly, Awkward,
Servile, or Arrogant?

920
01:10:44,487 --> 01:10:46,216
Servile?

921
01:10:46,322 --> 01:10:47,448
- Very good!
- Fuck, yeah!

922
01:10:47,557 --> 01:10:53,120
Bring on the bull-shit, S.A.T.'s!
I'm-a fuck them up!

923
01:10:54,997 --> 01:10:56,965
<i>So...</i>

924
01:10:58,067 --> 01:11:00,433
<i>how's Jonah?</i>

925
01:11:01,671 --> 01:11:03,400
I don't know.
You'd have to ask him.

926
01:11:08,010 --> 01:11:10,604
- What?
- Nothing.

927
01:11:13,416 --> 01:11:14,713
Let's trade secrets.

928
01:11:14,984 --> 01:11:16,383
No.

929
01:11:16,485 --> 01:11:18,453
I'll tell you a secret,
then you tell me one.

930
01:11:18,554 --> 01:11:20,146
- No.
- Come on. It will be fun.

931
01:11:20,256 --> 01:11:22,952
Like we're at a slumber party.

932
01:11:25,194 --> 01:11:27,355
Okay. I'll go first.

933
01:11:29,565 --> 01:11:34,525
Bookstores make me
have to go shit.

934
01:11:35,705 --> 01:11:37,935
- What?!
- Yeah, I don't know what it is.

935
01:11:38,040 --> 01:11:40,736
I can't be in a bookstore
for more than, like, 15 minutes

936
01:11:40,843 --> 01:11:42,276
before I have to go.

937
01:11:42,445 --> 01:11:44,606
- That's disgusting!
- Oh, come on!

938
01:11:44,714 --> 01:11:48,172
Maybe it's some repressed
Barnes & Noble trauma

939
01:11:48,284 --> 01:11:51,515
deep in my childhood,
but it happens without fail.

940
01:11:51,687 --> 01:11:56,147
- I sit next to you in English!
- Okay. Your turn.

941
01:11:56,425 --> 01:11:57,414
No!

942
01:11:57,560 --> 01:11:59,425
Come on! That was
really embarrassing!

943
01:11:59,528 --> 01:12:01,052
You have to give me something.

944
01:12:01,163 --> 01:12:02,994
Dude, that is your own
damn problem.

945
01:12:03,099 --> 01:12:06,262
One of many, it seems.

946
01:12:10,506 --> 01:12:13,737
I know about you and Jonah.

947
01:12:15,645 --> 01:12:17,840
What about me and Jonah?

948
01:12:17,947 --> 01:12:21,314
That you were together all day
Sunday and then lied about it.

949
01:12:21,417 --> 01:12:22,748
Bookstores?

950
01:12:22,852 --> 01:12:26,344
Seriously, I was joking about that.

951
01:12:27,923 --> 01:12:30,414
I'm perceptive, you know?

952
01:12:30,526 --> 01:12:33,393
I can tell when people are lying.

953
01:12:33,796 --> 01:12:36,924
<i>Come on. Let me just...</i>

954
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:39,994
<i>be your friend for once. </i>

955
01:12:40,469 --> 01:12:43,370
I'd really like to.

956
01:12:55,217 --> 01:12:57,515
He likes me, and I like him.

957
01:12:57,920 --> 01:13:00,115
More than Kevin?

958
01:13:00,856 --> 01:13:03,416
Different than Kevin.

959
01:13:03,526 --> 01:13:08,520
I understand. Jonah is a good guy.

960
01:13:08,631 --> 01:13:10,565
<i>Have you guys...?</i>

961
01:13:11,167 --> 01:13:13,032
No.

962
01:13:16,072 --> 01:13:17,767
Kind of.

963
01:13:17,873 --> 01:13:20,671
Almost.

964
01:13:21,510 --> 01:13:22,568
But it doesn't matter,

965
01:13:22,678 --> 01:13:25,408
because all I have to do
is wait a few more days, right,

966
01:13:25,514 --> 01:13:28,972
and then he'll be gone,
and then the decision makes itself.

967
01:13:29,085 --> 01:13:31,815
Only if you let it.

968
01:13:31,921 --> 01:13:34,890
- You want to know what I think?
- No, not really.

969
01:13:34,990 --> 01:13:37,823
You need to make
that decision for yourself.

970
01:13:38,094 --> 01:13:42,861
Don't take the easy way out,
or you'll regret it.

971
01:13:44,200 --> 01:13:46,464
Well, I'm pretty sure I'm gonna
end up regretting something

972
01:13:46,569 --> 01:13:49,470
when this is over,
no matter what I do.

973
01:13:55,211 --> 01:13:57,679
<i>The only thing that bugs me more
than when Beth shares secrets</i>

974
01:13:57,780 --> 01:14:00,613
<i>Is when Beth is right. </i>

975
01:14:01,617 --> 01:14:04,347
<i>This is a decision
I have to come to myself. </i>

976
01:14:04,453 --> 01:14:08,822
<i>I can't just ride this out
and accept the default answer. </i>

977
01:14:09,125 --> 01:14:12,219
<i>Predictable
doesn't always mean boring. </i>

978
01:14:12,394 --> 01:14:14,862
<i>Lust doesn't always mean love. </i>

979
01:14:14,964 --> 01:14:18,456
<i>Near doesn't always mean close. </i>

980
01:14:24,173 --> 01:14:26,607
<i>New doesn't always mean exciting. </i>

981
01:14:26,742 --> 01:14:29,677
<i>Different doesn't always mean better. </i>

982
01:14:29,779 --> 01:14:32,714
<i>Far doesn't always mean distant. </i>

983
01:14:33,616 --> 01:14:36,050
<i>Knowing everything
doesn't make you wise. </i>

984
01:14:36,152 --> 01:14:39,178
<i>Knowing the truth
doesn't make you superior. </i>

985
01:14:39,288 --> 01:14:43,748
<i>Knowing your problem
doesn't solve It. </i>

986
01:14:43,859 --> 01:14:46,851
<i>Sitting between
your past and your future</i>

987
01:14:46,962 --> 01:14:52,457
<i>doesn't mean you're in the present. </i>

988
01:14:55,638 --> 01:14:57,606
What did you think?

989
01:14:57,706 --> 01:14:59,674
Sucks.

990
01:14:59,775 --> 01:15:01,367
Yeah.

991
01:15:03,813 --> 01:15:06,941
I'm leaving. Going home.

992
01:15:07,516 --> 01:15:10,110
- When?
- Now.

993
01:15:10,219 --> 01:15:11,982
What do you mean, "now"?

994
01:15:12,154 --> 01:15:15,817
Now, like this minute.
I can't be here.

995
01:15:17,193 --> 01:15:19,423
Please don't go.
I don't want you to.

996
01:15:19,595 --> 01:15:22,189
Yeah. I know.
That makes two of us.

997
01:15:22,298 --> 01:15:23,492
But I think you're
trying to make a decision,

998
01:15:23,599 --> 01:15:25,499
and I'm gonna make it easier on you.

999
01:15:25,601 --> 01:15:29,059
I'm eliminating myself as a choice.

1000
01:15:32,808 --> 01:15:34,742
So, a great fucking movie, or what?

1001
01:15:34,844 --> 01:15:35,776
It sucked!

1002
01:15:35,878 --> 01:15:37,038
What the fuck?
Are you deaf, dumb, and blind?

1003
01:15:37,146 --> 01:15:39,046
That movie was amazing, dude!

1004
01:15:39,148 --> 01:15:42,481
Kev, I'm gonna
head out of town tonight.

1005
01:15:42,585 --> 01:15:43,882
What the fuck? Why?

1006
01:15:43,986 --> 01:15:47,149
I got to get back-tuff to do.

1007
01:15:47,890 --> 01:15:49,380
Why didn't you say
some shit earlier, dude?

1008
01:15:49,558 --> 01:15:50,786
We could have planned
a party or something.

1009
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:51,927
I know. It's cool.

1010
01:15:52,027 --> 01:15:53,858
I'm with the only people
I want to see.

1011
01:15:54,730 --> 01:15:57,130
Dude. All right, bro.

1012
01:15:58,934 --> 01:16:00,333
- Well, good seeing you, man.
- You too.

1013
01:16:00,436 --> 01:16:01,403
I love you, bro.

1014
01:16:02,471 --> 01:16:05,702
- You too.
- All right.

1015
01:16:08,611 --> 01:16:09,839
- Bye.
- Bye.

1016
01:16:11,447 --> 01:16:14,575
I'm sorry for coming in
and fucking up your life.

1017
01:16:20,489 --> 01:16:23,686
See you later, kids.

1018
01:16:27,062 --> 01:16:29,758
Well, I guess I know where you'll be
if we ever break up.

1019
01:16:29,865 --> 01:16:32,060
- What?
- "What?"

1020
01:16:32,167 --> 01:16:33,099
A couple more seconds in that hug,

1021
01:16:33,202 --> 01:16:36,069
and I'd have to fucking
drop-kick his ass.

1022
01:16:36,372 --> 01:16:38,966
You're stupid. Shut up.

1023
01:16:39,074 --> 01:16:41,838
You know, he's a really good guy.

1024
01:16:41,944 --> 01:16:44,378
I like him.

1025
01:16:44,713 --> 01:16:46,977
Me, too.

1026
01:16:49,585 --> 01:16:52,179
Come on. Let's go.

1027
01:17:04,934 --> 01:17:06,993
Did you notice something funny
about Jonah tonight?

1028
01:17:08,938 --> 01:17:10,200
Like how?

1029
01:17:10,306 --> 01:17:15,107
<i>I don't know.
Like, he looked all, like...sad. </i>

1030
01:17:16,445 --> 01:17:20,381
- Yeah, I suppose he did.
- Yeah.

1031
01:17:21,784 --> 01:17:24,947
I haven't seen that look on his face
since we asked him to quit the band.

1032
01:17:25,421 --> 01:17:27,082
I thought that you kicked him out.

1033
01:17:28,624 --> 01:17:32,082
Kicked him out, asked him to quit.
Same thing. Whatever.

1034
01:17:33,362 --> 01:17:36,593
<i>Same thing. Whatever. </i>

1035
01:17:39,001 --> 01:17:40,161
Want to go bowling?

1036
01:17:42,338 --> 01:17:43,930
Not really.

1037
01:17:50,279 --> 01:17:51,644
Want to go back to your place?

1038
01:17:52,848 --> 01:17:54,873
My mom came home today.

1039
01:17:59,488 --> 01:18:03,948
<i>Same thing. Whatever. </i>

1040
01:18:04,827 --> 01:18:05,919
What?

1041
01:18:18,440 --> 01:18:21,637
<i>I know that I have to
make a choice,</i>

1042
01:18:21,744 --> 01:18:24,941
<i>regret it or not. </i>

1043
01:18:25,114 --> 01:18:28,481
<i>I choose to be alone. </i>

1044
01:18:29,885 --> 01:18:32,376
<i>I choose to jump face-first,</i>

1045
01:18:32,488 --> 01:18:36,481
<i>to not just kick back
and enjoy the ride. </i>

1046
01:18:36,592 --> 01:18:43,464
<i>I choose nether my future
nor my past, but my present, my now. </i>

1047
01:19:12,961 --> 01:19:16,920
<i>So, it turns out senior year sucked
a little bit less than junior year,</i>

1048
01:19:17,032 --> 01:19:20,468
<i>and Beth is still, well, Beth,</i>

1049
01:19:20,636 --> 01:19:22,695
<i>still obsessed with college
and careers and all that shit,</i>

1050
01:19:22,805 --> 01:19:25,171
<i>but we're friends again,</i>

1051
01:19:25,274 --> 01:19:29,677
<i>not because we are, but because
we actually like each other. </i>

1052
01:19:31,980 --> 01:19:33,811
<i>There are even times
when I don't mind</i>

1053
01:19:33,916 --> 01:19:37,010
<i>being able to see
through all the bullshit. </i>

1054
01:19:38,287 --> 01:19:40,482
<i>I mean, what the hell
am I supposed to do, you know?</i>

1055
01:19:40,589 --> 01:19:42,750
<i>It is what it is. </i>

1056
01:19:42,858 --> 01:19:46,385
<i>And there are
a lot of liars out there. </i>

1057
01:19:46,495 --> 01:19:50,192
<i>Now I'm just starting to do
something about It. </i>

1058
01:19:54,002 --> 01:19:57,130
<i>Same thing. Whatever. </i>

1059

<i>Those 3 stupid words

- Shouldn't you be studying?
- Mom, I'll be fine.

1077
01:21:09,178 --> 01:21:12,409
- Remember, keeps your hands at--
- 10 and 2, Mom. I know.

1078
01:21:12,514 --> 01:21:14,982
There will probably be a few
trick questions on the test.

<i>Mom...</i>

1080

Your father would have been
a much better driving instructor.

1081
01:21:22,524 --> 01:21:24,958
I like the one I had just fine.

1082
01:21:25,060 --> 01:21:26,459
Well, I tried.

1083
01:21:26,628 --> 01:21:29,358
And you succeeded.

1084
01:21:29,865 --> 01:21:31,594
Now serving B52.

1085
01:21:31,700 --> 01:21:34,328
- Is that you?
- No.

1086
01:21:35,304 --> 01:21:36,464
You know, you never did tell me

1087
01:21:36,572 --> 01:21:38,733
why this sudden urge
to get your license.

1088
01:21:40,475 --> 01:21:43,273
I got sick of relying
on people for a ride.

1089
01:21:44,012 --> 01:21:46,037
Well, I don't want you
driving at night.

1090
01:21:46,315 --> 01:21:49,978
- Okay.
- Now serving B21 .

Oh, that's me!

1092
01:21:51,386 --> 01:21:53,320
Wish me luck, okay?

1093

Remember to put your seat belt on.

1099
01:23:14,036 --> 01:23:16,266
<i>Somehow</i>

1100
01:23:17,773 --> 01:23:22,540
<i>I'm leading someone else's life</i>

1101
01:23:22,644 --> 01:23:25,408
<i>I cut a star down</i>

1102
01:23:26,982 --> 01:23:28,745
<i>With my knife</i>

1103
01:23:32,020 --> 01:23:34,682
<i>And right now</i>

1104
01:23:36,224 --> 01:23:41,787
<i>I still see the way the moon</i>

1105
01:23:43,198 --> 01:23:45,723
<i>Plays this tune</i>

1106
01:23:45,834 --> 01:23:48,894
<i>Though our lights died</i>

1107
01:23:52,507 --> 01:23:55,965
<i>My hands shake</i>

1108
01:23:56,345 --> 01:23:59,576
<i>Every superhero has a nemesis. </i>

1109
01:24:01,983 --> 01:24:04,178
<i>It's every day</i>

1110
01:24:04,286 --> 01:24:05,776
<i>Someone that negates her powers</i>

1111
01:24:05,887 --> 01:24:08,754
<i>and brings her down
amongst the mortals. </i>

1112
01:24:08,857 --> 01:24:11,121
<i>Then came you</i>

1113
01:24:11,226 --> 01:24:13,387
<i>And as you</i>

1114
01:24:13,495 --> 01:24:15,929
<i>Keep your picture</i>

1115
01:24:16,398 --> 01:24:20,164
<i>Someone that makes her
no more than human. </i>

1116
01:24:20,402 --> 01:24:22,563
<i>Then came you</i>

1117
01:24:22,671 --> 01:24:24,662
<i>When I'm lost</i>

1118
01:24:24,773 --> 01:24:28,709
<i>Look at my picture of you</i>

1119
01:24:37,018 --> 01:24:39,282
<i>And somehow</i>

1120
01:24:41,123 --> 01:24:45,617
<i>I'll make tonight our own</i>

1121
01:24:45,727 --> 01:24:49,026
<i>Show you every way I've grown</i>

1122
01:24:49,131 --> 01:24:52,965
<i>Sometimes I think I made him up,</i>

1123
01:24:55,971 --> 01:24:59,236
<i>And I reached out through the ether,
through the haze,</i>

1124
01:24:59,341 --> 01:25:00,706
<i>and tapped him
on the shoulder and said,</i>

1125
01:25:00,809 --> 01:25:03,801
<i>"Hey, please, come wake me up. "</i>

1126
01:25:03,912 --> 01:25:08,906
<i>I'll learn the parts and play along</i>

1127
01:25:09,017 --> 01:25:11,281
<i>If you let me</i>

1128
01:25:11,620 --> 01:25:15,317
<i>Every superhero has a nemesis. </i>

1129
01:25:15,424 --> 01:25:17,392
<i>My hands shake</i>

1130
01:25:17,492 --> 01:25:20,928
<i>Mine is a cute
stoner boy named Jonah. </i>

1131
01:25:21,029 --> 01:25:23,759
<i>My knees quake</i>

1132
01:25:24,933 --> 01:25:28,232
<i>It's every day</i>

1133
01:25:29,271 --> 01:25:31,705
<i>The same way</i>

1134
01:25:31,807 --> 01:25:34,037
<i>'Cause then came you</i>

1135
01:25:34,142 --> 01:25:36,303
<i>Then there's you</i>

1136
01:25:36,411 --> 01:25:38,743
<i>I keep your picture</i>

1137
01:25:38,847 --> 01:25:41,145
<i>In my worn-through shoes</i>

1138
01:25:41,249 --> 01:25:43,183
<i>Then there's you</i>

1139
01:25:43,285 --> 01:25:45,515
<i>Then came you</i>

1140
01:25:45,620 --> 01:25:47,588
<i>When I'm lost</i>

1141
01:25:47,756 --> 01:25:51,886
<i>I look at my picture of you</i>

1142
01:25:54,930 --> 01:25:57,125
<i>If you let me</i>

1143
01:25:57,232 --> 01:26:02,499
<i>I'll show the world to you</i>

1144
01:26:04,105 --> 01:26:07,597
<i>Yes, if you let me</i>

1145
01:26:07,709 --> 01:26:10,701
Tell me you love me.
