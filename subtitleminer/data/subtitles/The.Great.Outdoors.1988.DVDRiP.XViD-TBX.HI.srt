(Woman) I would have thought
they'd made some improvements.

Come on. Everybody.

Our Lady of Victory, pray for us.
Break! Let's go.

(Man) Watch the doors.

Whoa! Trees in the parking lot!

(Laughing) Oh.

34
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,829
Nature all around us, boys.

00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,871
Take it in. Take it all in.

36
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:44,151
(Inhales) I'm gonna go check us in.

00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,031
This is great.

38
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,592
Well? Is this a real north woods
lodge or what?

39
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,710
- Uh-huh.
- It's great.

40
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,433
Check out the shotgun lamp.

41
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,029
Isn't that something?
You don't see that every day.

42
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,068
Hey!

43
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,716
Hello? Anybody home?

44
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:20,070
- Looks the same, doesn't it?
- Doesn't it?

45
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:23,351
- Smells the same too.
- Yeah, it does. Hello!

46
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,309
- Do they have chickens?
- What's this?

47
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,396
"For prompt service, blow me."

48
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,910
- Interesting touch.
- Charming.

49
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,911
- Blow it.
- Shall I?

00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,910
Whoa!

53
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,393
Jeez!

54
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,469
Don't mind Wormer. She hates people.

55
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,717
Wormer, shut the frig up.
What can I do you for?

56
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,797
What happened to that dog's face?

57
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,877
Porcupine quills.
Loves porcupines, hates people.

58
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,672
She's in heat too.

59
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,598
Too bad you're not a dog.
What can I do you for?

60
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,312
Has your dog ever had a bath before?

61
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,999
There she is.
That's a gorgeous cabin.

62
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:26,312
OK. Hold it. That's good enough.

63
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,999
That's bigger
than our honeymoon cabin.

64
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,715
You city-dwelling fools
are lucky to have this cabin.

65
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:37,197
- It became available yesterday.
- We call it "the loon's nest".

66
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:41,119
- Know what a loon is?
- Yeah, we have one in our family.

67
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:45,199
We had a fishing party in there.
They caught their limit and blew.

68
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,629
- It's all redecorated.
- Every bit.

69
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:52,356
We sank over 300 bucks into it,
not counting what we spent on Lysol.

70
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,473
- Is that right?
- It's beautiful. Enjoy your stay.

71
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,478
- Thanks.
- How could you not in this place?

72
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,954
You could get the shits
from the well water.

73
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,468
- What did he say?
- I missed it.

74
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,311
What a gas.

75
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:35,079
Chet's gonna shit a solid gold brick!

76
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,794
I'll go see where he's bivouacked
the family.

77
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,354
This is very unfair, Roman.

78
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,233
What? We're a family,
for crying out loud!

79
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:47,716
We're always inviting Chet and Connie
to the islands.

80
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:51,673
- We weren't invited here.
- They'll be tickled to see us.

81
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:55,156
Honey? I found out
what was stinking up the shower.

82
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,554
A present from me to you.

83
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:03,430
How thoughtful.
Put it in there with the others.

84
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:06,040
There's fish everywhere.
Look, a pink one.

85
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,709
All right, let's leave this stuff
right here, OK?

86
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,479
Get your bathing suit
and we'll go to the lake.

87
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:15,796
No, you go.
I just can't seem to relax in filth.

88
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,593
We'll all clean up later. Let's go.

89
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,552
Someone has to find the toilet seat.

90
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,717
- Buck found it on the sun porch.
- Sun porch?

91
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,955
- It makes you wonder.
- No excuses.

92
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,831
- What are you doing?
- I don't know.

93
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,757
- Stop it.
- The kids are at the lake.

94
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,189
- Chet, what are you doing?
- Nothing.

95
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,673
Honey, no.

96
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,598
We got the house to ourselves. Hello!

97
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:40,438
Oh, no, what happened? I'm sorry.

98
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,711
I just don't feel like this.
I'm tired, I'm stinky.

99
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,671
- Come on.
- What are you doing?

100
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,712
- We got the house by ourselves.
- What about the kids?

101
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,830
- They're down the lake.
- Don't!

102
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,235
- Let's go to the bedroom.
- Why?

103
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,238
That's the great thing
about being in the woods.

104
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:59,033
- What are you feeding me now?
- Come on.

105
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:02,550
You can run around naked
and you won't run into anybody.

106
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,909
- Is that right?
- Yes.

107
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,234
Really?

108
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:11,149
Do you think it's possible
that we could play fashion parade?

109
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,111
- I don't want to play.
- Why?

110
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:16,869
- You get to wear the good outfits.
- I'll let you wear them.

111
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,718
- You will?
- You will be Shelana.

112
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,712
- Shelana, the oak tree woman.
- I love being the oak tree woman!

113
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:28,070
- Temptress of the woods.
- Yes!

114
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:31,795
And I will be Burt. A guy named Burt.

115
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,236
I love it when you're Burt.
You're always so manly.

116
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,635
Or I could be Smokey's cousin Horny.

117
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:41,558
- He has endurance too.
- Yes, he does.

118
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,556
(Roman) Anybody home?

119
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,875
(Chuckling)

120
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:52,596
Shelana the woods temptress
with Horny the bear, Smokey's cousin?

121
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,552
OK. OK.

122
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,910
- Turn that off.
- Oh, yeah! No, Chester, you said it.

123
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,554
Do it on the floor!

124
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,636
Beautiful style. That's all right.

125
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:08,468
Role-playing helps in a marriage
after a while.

126
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,511
Turn the damn thing off.

127
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:17,556
That was quite a surprise.
You got me.

128
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,556
(Chuckles)

129
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,194
And the whole week you'll be here.

130
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,879
Ha-ha, OK!

131
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:27,559
Oh, wow. Just something.

132
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,028
Anyway, you're an intelligent man.

133
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,593
Thank you.

134
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,631
- Make a good living.
- Not bad.

135
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,750
- Got a good life.
- Pretty good.

136
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,552
- Answer me this.
- Sure.

137
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,910
Why would you want to come
to a no-man's-land like this

138
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,633
and live like a barbarian for a week?

139
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:47,558
- You wouldn't understand.
- Try me.

140
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:52,513
I have great memories of this country.
I used to come here with my dad

141
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,279
and I want the boys to have
the same memories.

142
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:59,598
Look around you, Roman, for God's
sakes, this is beautiful country.

143
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,392
Take a good look.

144
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,557
I'll tell you what I see,
if you want to know.

145
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,591
Yeah, I'm curious.

146
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,553
The underdeveloped resources
of Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan,

147
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:14,912
a consortium exploiting over
a billion dollars in forest products.

148
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,997
I see a paper mill
and a mining operation,

149
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:21,430
a green belt between lakeside condos
and a waste management facility

150
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:25,029
focusing on the newest rage in waste -
medical refuse.

151
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:28,675
Infected bandages, body parts,
IV tubing, syringes,

152
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,792
fluid, blood, radioactive waste -
all contained,

153
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,957
sunken in the lake
and sealed for centuries.

154
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,468
I ask you, what do you see?

155
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,870
I just see...

156
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,911
see trees.

157
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:48,157
No one ever accused you
of having a grand vision.

158
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:51,510
While the ambitious scramble
for wealth and power,

159
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,835
the Chets of the world can lay back

160
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,997
and casually stroll along life's path.

161
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,429
- That's a compliment.
- Oh, thanks.

162
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:03,439
The rest of us will probably die
of strokes long before you!

163
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,789
I hope so. Wouldn't that be great?

164
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:10,789
To see a bunch of people drop
that you hate. That'd be something else.

165
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,320
My goodness! My goodness me.

166
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:17,158
I'm going to walk down life's path
right now.

167
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,270
Get the barbecue going, hot dogs...

168
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,471
Wait a minute. No way.
Wait a hot shit minute.

169
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:25,398
Rule one - no relative of mine
is eating hot dogs

170
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,079
as long as he's sharing my cabin. Katie!

171
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:32,516
Do you sense the presence
of an alien life form?

172
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:37,274
Now you mention it, I do sense
something kind of strange.

173
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,312
Oh, sh...

174
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,158
(# Theme from The Twilight Zone)

175
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,550
Did I tell you
about the futures market?

176
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,831
- Probably.
- We got a Deutschmarks contract,

177
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,917
sat on it a week, sold it,
took in a 300% profit.

178
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:02,309
Well, easy money
is money easily lost.

179
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:05,830
I can't believe how old-fashioned
your thinking is.

180
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,079
- 300% profit, huh?
- Sometimes 200% or 100%.

181
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,588
Take the good with the bad.

182
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:16,359
Yeah. Still, that's pretty good.

183
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:20,359
Point of the matter is,
you should have your piece too.

184
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,638
Whoa! Hot!

185
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:26,832
- How are those tails?
- They're 28 bucks a pop.

186
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:31,795
28? Oh, my God. Chet and I haven't
had lobster since our anniversary.

187
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,991
- Oh, my God. A jumping lobster!
- Save that one.

188
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:38,634
- That'll be for me.
- I'll make sure of that.

189
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:41,240
The gourmet here wanted hot dogs.

190
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,310
You know what they're made of?

191
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,271
Lips and assholes.

192
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,233
(Sarcastic laughter)
I'm old-fashioned. I like assholes.

193
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,032
Ha! And I like lips!

194
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:57,114
If I could market lips like those,
I'd make another million!

195
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,151
(Laughter)

196
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,356
(Roman) Lobster turned out all right,
if I do say so myself.

197
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:11,511
We should go into town
and pick up a ski boat.

198
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,551
What do you say? Sound good, guys?

199
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,990
Uncle Roman will blow some coin
on a kick-ass drag boat.

200
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,917
We're renting a pontoon boat.

201
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:22,191
Pontoon boat. What are you going to do
with a pontoon boat?

202
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,595
Retake Omaha Beach?

203
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:28,599
Not at all. A pontoon boat,
you go out and cruise the lake.

204
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,234
You swim from them, fish from them,

205
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:34,795
even bring the barbecue out.
You have a great time.

206
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,876
You tour the lake in comfort.

207
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:39,150
You guys want to cruise in comfort

208
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,919
or would you rather skim the waves
in a jet boat?

209
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,951
Jet boat!

210
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,389
- Sorry, Dad.
- (Roman) Attaboy, Benny!

211
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,795
All right, that's my man.

212
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,796
Care to put it to a vote?

213
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:54,594
We don't need a vote.
You want a jet boat, get a jet boat.

214
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:57,871
- Buck and I are getting a pontoon boat.
- Sorry, Dad.

215
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,036
Directly from the mouths of babes!

216
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,913
Are you going to argue
or enjoy yourselves?

217
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,837
I'm enjoying, Chet's arguing!

218
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:08,793
How about if the kids catch fireflies?
We can play cards.

219
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:13,311
Cara, Mara. You little dolls want
to go outside and catch fireflies?

220
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,555
Honey, they don't like bugs.

221
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,558
What? All kids like bugs. They're cute.

222
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,876
Especially fireflies.
Their butts light up.

223
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,911
(Screams echo)

224
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,988
I am a killer Monopoly player.

225
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,474
Roman taught me. He's vicious.

226
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:35,115
- (Roman) Buddy Riecher died.
- Oh, no.

227
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,151
President of Energy Resources.

228
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,430
- Honey.
- Died in bed.

229
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:42,916
- He was your mentor, wasn't he?
- A man I admired.

230
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:45,872
- I'm trying to read here!
- Sorry. Sorry.

231
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,992
I think I have to, er, tell you this story.

232
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:53,669
A story that might save your lives
up here in the woods.

233
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:56,280
I know the Heimlich maneuver.

234
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,671
No. This is a...

235
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,871
a bear story.

236
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,871
A true bear story.

237
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,914
Connie and I honeymooned
at this very lake.

238
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,757
Big spender!

239
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:17,315
- We stayed at my uncle's cabin.
- Uncle George?

240
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,510
Yeah. That's right.

241
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,949
One night
we were getting ready for bed

242
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,790
and we heard this terrible noise
out by the trash cans.

243
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:29,149
You remember? And, er...

244
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:33,512
I went downstairs to check it out,
looked out the window...

245
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,591
and there...

246
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:42,475
was the biggest,
baddest bear in the north woods.

247
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:47,150
- Sure, Dad.
- No, it's true. It's true.

248
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:51,432
This bear was over eight feet high.

249
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,910
With big, white teeth.

250
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:59,270
- (Growling)
- Fangs...

251
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,311
stained pink...

252
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:06,189
from whatever it killed
before it got to our cabin.

253
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,590
It was frightening.

254
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,911
Frightening.

255
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:18,715
- The paws on this thing were immense.
- Urgh.

256
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:21,558
With big, black claws.

257
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,790
Razor sharp...

258
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,274
like Freddy Krueger.

259
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,276
(Screams)

260
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,635
Only worse, worse.

261
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:36,878
This wasn't a movie.
This was happening right in front of me.

262
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:39,832
And all that separated me
from that bear...

263
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,478
was a pane of glass.

264
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:45,193
Honey, maybe we shouldn't
tell this story...

265
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,595
- It's fine.
- I'm thinking about nightmares.

266
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:50,473
No, no. They have to hear this.

267
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:55,548
Like I say,
it might save their life one day.

268
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:02,111
Now, I saw that bear. It saw me.

269
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,911
And it was hungry.

270
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,791
Hungry for blood!

271
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,355
Human blood.

272
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:14,870
You see, once a bear gets a taste
for blood...

273
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,991
it craves it.

274
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,755
It needs it.
It will do anything it can to get it.

275
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:26,075
That bear had become...

276
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,111
a man-eater!

277
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:32,709
Our eyes locked. My heart was pumping.

278
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:38,790
Pump, pump, pump, pump, pump.

279
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:42,879
I ran into the living room,
grabbed the shotgun off the mantle,

280
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:48,040
turned around, and there was that bear
right in the window.

281
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:51,709
Its breath was fogging up the glass.

282
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:58,598
And suddenly,
it let out this god-awful roar.

283
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:02,428
(Roaring)

284
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:07,031
It started smashing the walls.
Pots and pans started rattling,

285
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:10,311
the walls shimmering
and the floorboards lifting.

286
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:13,955
I knew then that it was either the bear
or your mom and I.

287
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,073
So I raised the rifle,
I took aim and I fired.

288
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,599
(Gunshot echoes)

289
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,710
- You wasted her?
- No, Benny.

290
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,991
- A shotgun's not going to kill that.
- What happened?

291
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:29,192
The buckshot shaved the hair
clean off the top of its head.

292
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:32,232
It ran off. We never saw it again.

293
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,595
I hear from my uncle now and then...

294
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:42,318
and he'd tell us about
the baldheaded killer bear in the area.

295
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:46,918
The baldheaded killer bear...

296
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:50,315
of Clare County.

297
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:55,912
- Is she still around?
- Oh! No, no. That bear's gone.

298
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:59,748
Well, she may be out there. (Sighs)

299
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:02,598
Crazy, bloodthirsty as ever.

300
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:06,638
So when you go to bed tonight...

301
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:09,433
if you hear a noise...

302
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,471
whatever you do...

303
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,512
don't look out the window.

304
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,436
Because it might be a bear!

305
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,675
(Screaming)

306
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,995
Christ! I'm half-drunk here, Chet!

307
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:25,510
- Are you trying to give me nightmares?
- Come on.

308
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:28,233
I can't believe you, Dad!

309
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,748
- Benny, honey.
- Thank you!

310
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:35,749
I'm 25 pounds overweight, I don't
need a blast to the ticker like that!

311
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:41,033
- Really inappropriate, Chet.
- What? It was a story. Come on.

312
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,993
Oh, come on.
It was a kind of true story.

313
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:49,635
Part of it happened.
I just embellished a bit. Come on!

314
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,955
What? What is that look?

315
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,558
So now I get the look?
I was just trying to have fun.

316
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,197
Oh, God!

317
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,800
So I made the fangs a little bigger. Jeez!

318
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:13,792
(Chet) You have nothing
to be afraid of, OK? I mean it.

319
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,795
It's a story my dad told me
and I'm sure his dad told him,

320
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:21,354
and I'm telling you. It's made up.

321
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:25,393
One day you're going to tell it
to your kids, I guarantee it.

322
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:32,309
Good evening. How's it going?

323
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,195
Listen, girls...

324
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,435
As your father,

325
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:42,756
I feel it incumbent upon me
to set the record straight

326
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,997
on the validity of the tale
Uncle Chet shared with us.

327
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:50,629
A story like that
coming from an authority figure

328
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,830
could be traumatizing for kids.

329
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,953
I had a similar experience with
my Uncle Roy and a story he told

330
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,357
about a family who were attacked
by a band of psychiatric patients

331
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:04,312
who had been subjected
to violent, hellish

332
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,920
behavior modification experiments.

333
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,236
They escaped from the metal boxes
the army kept them in,

334
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:13,397
found this family in the woods,
fell upon them,

335
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,590
slaughtered them and ate them.

336
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:19,110
That story gave me nightmares
not to be believed,

337
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:23,073
so I don't want Uncle Chet's
bear story to upset you.

338
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,554
So I'm here to say
that there is no bear

339
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:30,310
and that all Uncle Chet was saying
was just a yarn for our entertainment

340
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:34,239
and even if there were a bear,
I'm in the house to protect you.

341
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:39,990
So, no more thinking about bears,
all right?

342
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,031
No more unpleasant things.

343
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,514
We're going to close our eyes

344
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:48,348
and dream about nice things.

345
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:53,235
About cuddly, soft, fluffy things.

346
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,875
OK?

347
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,717
Super.

348
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:01,069
Good night. Sleep tight.

349
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:12,597
(Raccoons chittering) 'Hey, kids...
New people in the loon's nest.'

350
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,756
'They have Illinois plates, Mom.'

351
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:20,430
'lf they're from Chicago,
we'll be eating good.

352
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,235
'Lobster tails!

353
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:28,634
'A shitload of raw hot dogs.'

354
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:32,592
'You know what they're made of...

355
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,915
'lips and assholes!'

356
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,236
(Snoring)

357
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,396
(Clock ticking)

358
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,678
Honey?

359
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:08,116
Chet? Where are you?

360
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:15,153
Oh, God! That's rotted. Oh!

361
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,518
Jerry Asner, please. Roman Craig.

362
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:23,394
Yeah, I can't hold for long.
My signal's kind of weak.

363
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,871
- Honey?
- Yes, Roman?

364
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:41,071
Why do Chet's kids look at him
like he's Zeus?

365
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:45,079
My kids look at me like
I'm a rack of yard tools at Sears.

366
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,719
I mean, why can't they connect
with me?

367
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:54,589
Maybe if you spent less time at work,
things would be different.

368
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,871
Put a cork in it, honey.
Talkin' business. Jerry?

369
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,070
Roman. How are you?

370
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:03,032
I'll save us trouble
and cut right to the chase.

371
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:05,548
I've got an investment opportunity.

372
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,797
You got about three minutes
and 25 grand? Jerry?

373
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,512
Did you hear what I said?

374
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:13,279
Lost the signal.
These phones don't work.

375
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:17,438
- Maybe he hung up.
- Why would a minister hang up?

376
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:20,790
- I've been to his church.
- Oh, yeah. Once!

377
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,030
All right!

378
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:27,275
How about that?

379
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:30,357
We'll be scraping the bugs
off our teeth with this!

380
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,392
- Dad.
- That's too much boat.

381
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,431
- Look...
- It's just too much.

382
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:38,916
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure. You hungry?

383
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,191
Give me four chili dogs
and two plain dogs, please.

384
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:45,676
- That's six hot dogs.
- It's for everybody.

385
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,711
And I'm hungry.

386
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,432
- So?
- Yeah.

387
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:54,109
Do you mind if I just walk around?
Cruise the town?

388
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:56,720
I can walk back when I'm done.

389
00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:01,231
All right. But you gotta promise me
we'll spend some time together.

390
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,271
- That's why we're here.
- I know.

391
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:06,437
That's the whole point -
to be in the woods,

392
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,153
together, rugged,
manly, the full nine yards.

393
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,555
- Exactly.
- Right?

394
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,836
- Give me a hug.
- What?

395
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,110
- Give me a hug.
- Dad...

396
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:21,233
- I'm too old for hugs.
- You're never too old for hugs.

397
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:24,158
- Can I go now? Thank you very much.
- Go.

398
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:28,796
Bring back your friends
for a ride in "suck my wake".

399
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,111
(Engine roars)

400
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,874
Great!

401
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,790
You've got it in neutral!

402
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,319
It's OK.

403
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:46,113
It's in neutral. You gotta put it...

404
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:58,520
(Laughter)

405
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:05,876
- OK.
- I'll figure it out. Just give me the skis.

406
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:09,151
I'm sorry. I forgot.
You're a professional skier.

407
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,191
You don't need any notes.

408
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:14,550
Any help from someone
who might know about skiing.

409
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:17,319
- We'll go over it once more.
- Fine.

410
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,237
- This is important.
- OK!

411
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:21,316
What are we doing sitting here?

412
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,989
He's teaching the kid.
He wants Benny to be safe.

413
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:27,793
Lean back. That feel better?

414
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:31,196
There you go. We're leaning back.
There's trouble.

415
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,993
- What?
- Trouble. There's trouble.

416
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:37,874
Come on. What do we do?
Let go of the rope.

417
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:41,593
If you're in trouble,
let go of the rope.

418
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:45,633
Remember, go loose when you fall.
Just go loose.

419
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,671
- What's he doing?
- I don't know.

420
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:50,109
- He's shaking.
- He's got a new dance.

421
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:54,039
- Hold this. Thanks, Dad.
- Are you going to ski or what?

422
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:57,470
I can't tell you how important this is.

423
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,875
(Roman) Let's go. Ski or flee.

424
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,911
Honey, he's waving.

425
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:08,554
- He's going?
- He's going. Great.

426
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,309
Whoa!

427
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,071
Hey, Dad, let go of the rope!

428
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:26,156
Oh, my God!

429
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,236
Help me, for God's sake!

430
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:31,397
Holy shit!

431
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,590
Oh, no!

432
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,477
Wow!

433
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,272
Whoa!

434
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,789
You bastard!

435
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,074
(Chet yelling)

436
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,710
- You bastard!
- What's he saying?

437
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,037
- You bastard!
- What's he saying?

438
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:03,071
- Faster.
- Faster?

439
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,917
Go faster.

440
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,110
(Roman cackling)

441
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,791
What the hell are you doing?

442
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:13,274
I'd love to see him rocksie!

443
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,829
I'm dead! I'm dead! I'm dead!

444
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,474
I'm dead! I'm dying! I'm dying!

445
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,796
I'm dying! I'm dying!

446
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:32,836
I'm alive. I'm alive.
Thank you. Thank you.

447
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,870
Oh, no!

448
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:45,353
(Screams)

449
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:00,431
(Groaning)

450
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,632
(Panting)

451
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:13,311
(Cheering)

452
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,079
(Man) What a show! What a champion!

453
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:28,718
- What are you doing?
- What does it look like?

454
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:31,558
I am not taking any more
of Roman's crap.

455
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,716
You can stay cos I'm out of here.

456
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,832
What happened that got you so crazy?

457
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:39,917
What happened?
Come on, what happened?

458
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:44,238
How about Roman dragging me
all over the goddamn lake?

459
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,953
- Have you seen my ass?
- Not recently.

460
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,719
I'll be picking splinters out of it till I die!

461
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:53,514
- Honey, come on.
- You find that funny? Hysterical!

462
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:56,279
It wasn't funny
but because I love you...

463
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:59,471
- Thanks a lot!
- What about the kids?

464
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,830
His kids? All right.
Let's talk about his kids.

465
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:08,193
They're spooky. I'm waiting for their
heads to rotate and vomit pea soup.

466
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:12,756
- I mean our kids.
- Our kids already do that.

467
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:16,793
What about this father-son thing?
You're gonna leave? Come on.

468
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:19,832
- He's driving me crazy!
- You're a big man.

469
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:22,678
You're a nice man
and you're above all this.

470
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,188
- Oh, don't.
- You are.

471
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:27,913
- Come on.
- I know it to be true.

472
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,190
Don't. Come on, I'm mad. I'm mad.

473
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,557
Come on. All right, all right.
Am I being silly?

474
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,750
Crazy. Stop.

475
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:43,395
- Why do you always do this?
- I'm crazy about you. Kiss me.

476
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:48,196
- Feel better?
- I do. I'm sorry. I feel like a kid.

477
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,912
OK.

478
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:52,349
Why did you do this? I was ready to go!

479
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:55,631
Why? I was almost in the car.

480
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:59,036
Now I've got to spend a week
with Roman.

481
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:01,992
You're gonna have fun from now on.

482
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:05,271
Roman's making goat-cheese pizza
to take to the lodge.

483
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:07,959
- Making what?
- Er...

484
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,672
- What did you say?
- Pizza.

485
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:12,393
- You said something else.
- Big man pizza.

486
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:14,670
What are you hiding?

487
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,392
- Tell me what it is.
- Pizza.

488
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:20,797
No. You said a goat. Is he making
goat pizza? Hey, come here!

489
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:26,277
Roman, I've got a few things
to gnaw over with you.

490
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,833
What's up?

491
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:30,599
I found your kids
inside the mine perimeter.

492
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:34,110
- What mine?
- There's an old mica mine.

493
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:37,948
It's full of boreholes,
sinkholes, pits, caves, hollows.

494
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,276
The war shut the facility down.

495
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:44,471
Anyway the kids go there
and yell down the holes

496
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,636
so they can hear their voices echo.

497
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,989
I won't tell you
what the teenagers do.

498
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:52,600
- I'll bet!
- Tell Ripley too.

499
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,073
Done.

500
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:56,111
Take care of them, Roman.

501
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:01,834
We could see a female
Elvis impersonator at Whitewater

502
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:04,872
and you want to wish happy birthday
to some guy?

503
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:07,150
If you want to go to Whitewater, go.

504
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,272
I find it more interesting
to pay my respects

505
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:13,517
to a man who's lived on this earth
109 years.

506
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:17,109
He's the oldest man in Canada.
Isn't that something?

507
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:20,516
I'd rather see a 46-inch bust
singing Burning Love.

508
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,152
Yeah.

509
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:28,594
Hey, Wally.
How about a nice club soda?

510
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,870
I'm driving tonight.

511
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:35,118
Nice outfit.
You're Mr. Coordinated tonight.

512
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,674
- Well...
- Quite the look on you.

513
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:42,032
Yeah. Well, the pants are riding
up the butt something fierce but...

514
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,310
look at that.

515
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:48,592
- Wally, how's the bear dump situation?
- We got a good one.

516
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,995
Good evening, sir. Happy birthday.

517
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:54,555
He must be hard of hearing
or something. Try again.

518
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:57,831
Sprechen Sie Deutsch?
Do you speak English?

519
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:00,440
Our sincerest congratulations, sir.

520
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:03,472
You wishing Mr. Tomkins
a happy birthday?

521
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:06,080
I don't think the guy can hear us.

522
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:09,954
How about a nice group photo?
Everybody get in there.

523
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,468
- I push the red button?
- (Buck) Yeah.

524
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,351
- How do you focus?
- You don't.

525
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,709
- You don't focus?
- Push the button.

526
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:21,436
I don't like them climbing around
Mr. Tomkins. He ain't no jungle gym.

527
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:24,677
Girls, why don't you kiss Mr. Tomkins
on the cheek?

528
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,870
- No.
- A nice kiss on the cheek.

529
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:30,708
Come on, it's cute!
What old man wouldn't like it?

530
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:34,070
A dead one.
Bill died in the car on the way over.

531
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:38,318
- Jesus, Dad!
- Go wash. Go wash.

532
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:40,920
- I touched him.
- In the bathroom.

533
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,758
- How could you do that?
- I didn't. He did it.

534
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,995
You're disgusting! Kids?

535
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:48,031
(# Rock)

536
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:07,077
That was a really good shot, Ben.
Really good.

537
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,918
What the hell?

538
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:31,232
Hey! You gave her a class goose
with the pool cue.

539
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:33,032
She's so cute.

540
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:37,193
Violent but cute.
You got chalk right there.

541
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:41,996
- Look, I'll be back in a minute.
- What about the bear dump?

542
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:44,429
(Bears growling)

543
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:51,759
(Chet) Hey, it's crowded. This is great.

544
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:55,349
- (Ben) Yeah, Dad.
- A lot of people are hip to this.

545
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,868
Oh, yeah. Hey!

546
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:03,516
Right. Look at those bears. Huh?

547
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:06,438
Are you scared or what?
Look at the bears!

548
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,914
- They're great, Dad.
- "They're great, Dad."

549
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:12,554
You're gonna see some bears.

550
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,795
- Dad?
- Shh, shh, shh.

551
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:20,269
Here you go! A nice Zagnut.

552
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,870
Yeah. Come on.

553
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,916
Come on.

554
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:30,315
Come on. More.

555
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,954
Come on. Here's some more.

556
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:38,759
Jeez. Boy, he likes those.

557
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,836
Now we'll get some action.

558
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:44,678
Big head on him. Ooh, boy.

559
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:47,075
Easy, easy there. Easy.

560
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:52,238
Come on, watch the paint job! Hey, shoo!

561
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:55,158
Look at the size of those teeth. Whoo.

562
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:59,917
- Hey! Shoo! Go on.
- Dad, I wouldn't do that.

563
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:03,077
All right. Maybe you're right.
He's looking at us.

564
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:07,033
He's not finished.
When he finishes, he'll go.

565
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:11,637
- Pretty big bear.
- Very big.

566
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:15,593
Just let him eat his candy bar
and shoo shoo shoo.

567
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,750
Hi. How you doing?

568
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:22,272
Whoo.

569
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,878
Oh, Jeez! All right, all right. OK.

570
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:31,798
Erm, let me rethink this.

571
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:34,593
Hey! What the hell?

572
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:46,395
All right.

573
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:50,479
- I've told you I love you, right?
- Yeah.

574
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,670
Good.

575
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:57,233
- What do you say we call it a night?
- (Banging)

576
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:01,398
Holy Jeez! Oh, boy!
Oh, boy. We've started something.

577
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,873
Erm...

578
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:05,912
- Let's call it an evening.
- Yeah. I'm tired.

579
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:09,270
- Me too. Yeah. Let's just go.
- Yeah.

580
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:11,754
(Engine starts)

581
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:14,872
- (Beeps horn)
- That didn't scare him, Dad.

582
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:18,151
I'm, erm... gonna move now.
I'm moving now!

583
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,953
All right. I'll just drive out.

584
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,152
He'll jump right off.
Don't you worry.

585
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:30,239
Dad? Isn't it illegal to drive
with a bear on your hood?

586
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:32,350
I don't know in this state, son.

587
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,072
(Bear growling)

588
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:36,759
(Chet) It's Yogi and Boo Boo in the flesh.

589
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:39,360
I wish Ranger Smith
would get out here.

590
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:42,790
- (Banging)
- Hey, easy on the roof, pal!

591
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:45,400
Should have brought Uncle Roman's car.

592
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:48,271
(Whooping and laughter)

593
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:52,671
Knock knock.

594
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:56,110
You, er, didn't give me
a chance to apologize.

595
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:05,118
- Can I sit down?
- I don't own the park.

596
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,151
Oh.

597
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:11,517
Look...

598
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,710
- I just got here. I'm from...
- Chicago.

599
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,268
- How did you know?
- It's no big trick.

600
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:22,438
You live in this town,
it becomes like second nature.

601
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:26,871
- I guess I just met my first local.
- You don't know how local I am.

602
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:31,437
You know...

603
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,838
It's a...

604
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:38,872
It's a really beautiful town. I mean...

605
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:41,673
It's a hole in the earth.

606
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:45,759
Look, save your breath.
I'm not a tourist attraction.

607
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,557
What did I do?

608
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:02,554
Hey, Dad.

609
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:05,398
- How are you?
- What are you doing down here?

610
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:08,637
Oh... getting a breath of night air.

611
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:14,590
Hey... You want to take a spin
in the rowboat?

612
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,591
- Now?
- What the hell?

613
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,949
- In the dark?
- We'll check out some stars.

614
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,560
- I don't know.
- Let's do something.

615
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:25,034
- Let's go.
- Dad...

616
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:27,310
Come on. I'll let you row.

617
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:29,396
- Oh, great.
- It'll be fun.

618
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:34,680
(Chet) Boy, what a beautiful sky.

619
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,148
Smell that air. Isn't that something?

620
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,838
(Buck coughs)

621
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:44,396
That's the city in your lungs.
You're getting the good air in now.

622
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:49,234
One day, you'll be coming up here
with your kids.

623
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:52,397
- Yeah. Maybe.
- I want to give you something.

624
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:56,274
You're not going to kiss me
in the boat under the moon?

625
00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:00,154
I'm not going to kiss you.
I want to give you my ring.

626
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,872
- Why?
- Why? Because...

627
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:08,310
my father gave it to me
and I'm giving it to you.

628
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:10,476
You're grown-up now. You deserve it.

629
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:12,511
So, like, er...

630
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:17,838
you and I coming to the woods
is like your father bringing you here?

631
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:20,792
- Yeah. I guess so.
- Yeah. I understand.

632
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,391
Thanks for the ring.

633
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:27,871
(Chittering)

634
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:31,880
'Rocks on top of the cans.

635
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:34,559
'That never works.

636
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:37,239
'We'll just knock the cans over.'

637
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,510
'Of course we will.

638
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:45,633
'Can I stay up again and watch
the big guy rake up all the mess?'

639
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,750
How are you doing... Cammie?

640
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:23,790
Can I help you?

641
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:26,195
I don't know.
What's the house specialty?

642
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:30,798
Where am I supposed to put the tray?

643
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:34,515
Going by last night, I'm sure you can
think of some good places.

644
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:37,472
I'm sorry. I was in kind of a bad mood.

645
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:40,669
Don't worry. It's no big deal.

646
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:44,395
That doesn't mean I didn't mean
what I said. It's true.

647
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:49,150
Wait. You don't even know me.
How can you say that's true of me?

648
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,589
- It's a safe assumption.
- (Man) Excuse me?

649
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:55,349
- Can we get some service?
- I'll be right there. I gotta go.

650
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:58,358
- What time do you finish work?
- Eight o'clock.

651
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,391
Eight o'clock?

652
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:03,193
And where are you
going to be after work?

653
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:05,549
I'll be around.

654
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:09,878
- Can I see you?
- Yeah. If you can find me.

655
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,829
I got you. I got you!

656
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:48,511
Come on, Chet!

657
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:51,677
If you trail behind,
the Indians will get you!

658
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:55,599
- Come on, honey.
- Uncle Roman, wait for Dad.

659
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:58,029
Come on! Hurry up.

660
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:01,675
Watch out for those Wisconsin
rattlers and wild boar.

661
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:04,518
(Connie) Honey, come on!

662
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,791
(Ben) Wait up, you guys.

663
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,950
Come on. Whoa. Hey. Ow!

664
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,912
Easy. All right. OK.

665
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:17,077
OK. Have it your way. I'll just get off.

666
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:23,948
You all right? OK.
We're walking. Come on.

667
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:28,311
Come on, let's go. Hey!

668
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:32,876
Easy, easy. Let's just walk back
to the stable, all right?

669
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:37,232
I'm walking, you're walking.
Let's have a nice easy walk.

670
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:44,234
All right. That was your last chance.
That's it. Have it your way.

671
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:49,156
I don't want to do this
but you forced me to.

672
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:56,391
I hate to do this to you.
I'm normally not a mean person but I...

673
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:59,953
Hey! Come back, you son of a bitch!

674
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,231
That baby I was riding
was a purebred -

675
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:06,271
purebred mule horse!

676
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:11,598
- You rode it like it was.
- That baby was bred for packing.

677
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:14,677
- You looked great on that horse.
- Here he comes.

678
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:17,678
Where is he? Hi, honey.

679
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:21,269
(Roman) He's lost his mount.
How are you doing, trouper?

680
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:24,517
Where's that ball-slappin' nag
you were riding?

681
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:27,233
- (Connie) He looks the worse for wear.
- OK, Dad?

682
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,953
- I'm OK.
- Did that horse buck you off?

683
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,834
What happened? You got hungry
and had to eat the nag, huh?

684
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:35,677
- Let's go home.
- What?

685
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:37,631
- Go home.
- Home?

686
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:40,240
- We've got the whole day planned!
- A nap.

687
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:41,918
- Come on!
- Oh, yeah.

688
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:45,669
- Come on!
- I'm fine. It was OK.

689
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:17,398
I know musky's the big deal fish
in these waters

690
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:19,670
but come with me
off the coast of Virginia,

691
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:22,951
I'll let you hook into
a thousand-pound blue marlin

692
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,231
and you'll know what fishing's
all about with a capital F!

693
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:30,398
Excuse him. After a few cocktails,
he's an expert on everything.

694
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:33,750
- Was that a shot?
- No, that was the truth.

695
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:36,394
- That was a shot.
- That was a shot.

696
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:38,635
Speaking of shots, set us up!

697
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:42,397
- This guy's a riot.
- Isn't he?

698
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:44,954
- Everybody loves him, right?
- Oh, yeah.

699
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,719
You make a lot of tips on this job?

700
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:50,433
- I do all right.
- Who handles your investments?

701
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,869
My wife's got some egg money
put aside

702
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:55,434
but she won't give it up to me.

703
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:58,153
I'll take her number, I'll change that.

704
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:00,430
That's what I do - investments.

705
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:02,391
How you doing?

706
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:06,831
Well, it-it-it-it-it-it
ain't-ain't r-r-r-raining.

707
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:11,590
- It ain't r-r-r-raining, so t-t-that's good.
- Yeah. I guess so.

708
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:14,438
- You fellas met Reg?
- I don't think so.

709
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:17,995
How you doing? Roman Craig.
Pleased to meet you.

710
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:21,555
Er, Chet Ripley. How do you do?

711
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:23,909
That's quite a hairdo you got.

712
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:25,996
- A neo-skunk thing?
- Roman!

713
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:28,395
- The hair!
- You don't have to say it.

714
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:31,671
His hair turned white
cos lightning hit him.

715
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:35,876
He's been struck by lightning...
How many times, Reg?

716
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:39,356
S-S-S-Six...

717
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:40,594
Six times?

718
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:43,677
S-S-Six...

719
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:45,711
Sixty-six times.

720
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:49,673
In-n-n...

721
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:51,199
the head!

722
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:53,879
Sixty-six times?

723
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:58,073
God! That's gotta hurt.

724
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:02,318
You'll never meet a guy more tuned in
to the barometric pressure than Reg.

725
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:08,117
Yeah. You see him running like hell
for home, head for cover. Right, Reg?

726
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:11,118
Hey, you pay. I gotta go to the john.

727
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:13,674
Introduce Mr. Thick Dick
to Mr. Urinal Cake.

728
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:15,870
Jeez, Roman! Do you have to?

729
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:20,232
What I really want to say is...
thank you.

730
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:22,635
This is very important
to Roman and me.

731
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:26,229
- I miss you, Connie.
- Oh, honey!

732
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:32,109
It's so lonely being wealthy.

733
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:34,196
Hm. I wouldn't know about that.

734
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:38,552
No, I mean it, honey.
I mean it, it is lonely.

735
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:41,797
He works terrible hours. Travels.

736
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:46,038
We go a month
without going to bed together.

737
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,150
Really? A month? That long?

738
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:50,758
Mm-hm.

739
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:54,998
I get pleasure by leaning against
the washer during the spin cycle.

740
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:59,991
- Does that work?
- Have you ever seen whiter whites?

741
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:02,315
(Kate giggling)

742
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:09,713
- When do you go back to Chicago?
- Erm, three days.

743
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:15,874
I've never had a boyfriend
for longer than two weeks.

744
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:20,277
- Get outta here.
- That's why I was such a bitch.

745
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:22,880
- No, you weren't a bitch.
- Yes, I was.

746
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:24,911
It's no big deal.

747
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:27,952
I don't understand
what I'm doing here.

748
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,560
Look, I've never even had a girlfriend.

749
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:37,348
I've dated girls
but never one I'd call my girlfriend.

750
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:41,716
- What would you call me?
- Officially?

751
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:47,719
Girlfriend?

752
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:52,510
And you're leaving in three days.
See what I mean?

753
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:54,437
Yeah.

754
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:57,040
- Well?
- Well what?

755
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:14,234
(Woman screaming)

756
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:20,036
- What? What?
- It touched me!

757
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:22,514
It's been touching you for 12 years.

758
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:24,516
- Not you!
- What?

759
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:26,278
- A thing.
- What thing?

760
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:29,710
What's going on for God's sakes?
What is it?

761
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:32,035
That thing!

762
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:36,390
That's just a little sparrow.

763
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:38,476
Come on, Roman, it's got ears.

764
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:40,670
Jesus!

765
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:43,314
(All yelling)

766
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:46,397
Jesus, it's a tiny flying mouse,
not a bear.

767
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:48,635
I am not going back in till it's out.

768
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:50,955
- We'll get it out. Chet.
- What?

769
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:55,198
Get a shovel, go in there
and get that radar-guided vermin.

770
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:59,793
- Why me?
- It's your cabin. We didn't order bats.

771
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:02,229
- You stay here too.
- You're the hosts.

772
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:04,874
- So what?
- Stop fighting and go kill it.

773
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:07,115
- We don't have to kill it.
- Kill it!

774
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:10,709
- It didn't do anything.
- It attacked me.

775
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:13,194
He's wimping out. I'll take care of it.

776
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:17,028
I am not wimping, I'm thinking.
There's a big difference.

777
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:19,548
If you want me to take care of it, I will.

778
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:24,310
I'm just wondering who's gonna do it.
I'll do it. I'd like to get some sleep.

779
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:27,231
Afraid of a little bat.

780
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:37,233
- So?
- It buzzed me.

781
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:41,512
We need a plan. It's bigger than
I thought. It's about a two-pounder.

782
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:43,835
- Two-pounder?
- Yeah, big wings.

783
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:46,599
- It's got the teeth. Frightening.
- Wow.

784
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:50,398
I think we have to do something.

785
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:53,830
What we need, Roman - big plan.
That's what we need.

786
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:04,712
We'll have this baby
squealing Mayday by midnight.

787
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:06,671
Let's split up.

788
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:14,671
- You see him?
- He's hiding.

789
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:18,599
Turn out the lights. He's nocturnal.
He'll think it's daytime like this.

790
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:20,631
Good point.

791
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:27,269
- Have you got him?
- Come on, you sonar-guided rodent.

792
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:33,314
- Connie, bats carry rabies, don't they?
- Yeah, among other things.

793
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:35,510
I'm gonna call him now.

794
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:37,312
OK, just be still.

795
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:40,193
(Kissing sounds)

796
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:43,676
- Are you kissing him or calling him?
- I'm calling him!

797
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:46,712
- That's the sound they make.
- OK, OK.

798
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:50,518
(Both shouting)

799
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:55,152
(All shouting at once)

800
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:57,350
- Dad!
- Oh, no...

801
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:01,715
(Roman) I got him!

802
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:07,472
Keep back.

803
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:10,990
- Get the light on him.
- Keep your eye on the bat.

804
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:12,678
Whoa!

805
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:14,836
Look at that thing move!

806
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:17,711
(Screams)

807
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:19,716
Christ Almighty!

808
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:21,671
Ooh, I hit my head.

809
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:23,517
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

810
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:26,074
He's in the rafters. Where are you?

811
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:28,076
I'm here!

812
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:30,236
- He's on my face!
- Hold still!

813
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:33,954
- (Chet groaning)
- Honey...

814
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,911
We got it!

815
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:38,918
- We got it!
- Oh, the pain.

816
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:42,077
- (Roman) We got it!
- Ooh, that had to hurt.

817
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:47,798
What a fighter.
Boy, he was something. I salute him.

818
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:51,954
But we got to get some sleep.

819
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:54,875
(All groan)

820
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:04,632
Hey.

821
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:07,513
- Glad to see you.
- What time do you get off work?

822
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:09,994
- Eight.
- Great. I'll meet you at nine.

823
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:13,237
- Where?
- I don't know! You live here.

824
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:16,397
- Erm, the bait shop?
- Sure.

825
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:18,431
I'll buy you some worms.

826
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:23,598
- You wanna ditch me?
- Wait a second. Why would I ditch you?

827
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:26,757
I don't know.
I'm just waiting for it to happen.

828
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:28,392
If I ditch you,

829
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:32,194
you have my permission never
to speak to me for as long as we live.

830
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:34,276
- Promise?
- Promise.

831
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:43,116
I got to go.

832
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:45,355
- See you later.
- Bye.

833
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:51,311
(Chet) Yeah, that should do it.
(Connie) Good idea.

834
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:55,433
I'll have the Royal Canadian Mounted
beef barley soup.

835
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:58,790
- Ooh, yeah.
- And then that bucket of salad.

836
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:02,230
- I'll split that with you.
- You will? That would help.

837
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:04,714
And then the medley of perch.

838
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:07,593
That's my favorite. OK.

839
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:11,030
Miss, what's the Old '96er?

840
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:14,709
That's our world-famous
Paul Bunyan's blue ox steak.

841
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:17,752
It is a 96-ounce prime-aged beef steak

842
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:22,032
and if any member of your party
orders the Old '96er and finishes,

843
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:24,071
everybody eats for free.

844
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:27,749
- Not bad, huh?
- Wanna go for it, girls?

845
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:30,792
- How about you, Chet?
- (Waitress) People like it.

846
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:34,515
- I'll try it. What the heck?
- Has anybody ever eaten one?

847
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:38,348
Oh... no. Not in my lifetime, no.

848
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:01,516
Bon apptit.

849
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:03,039
Oh, good God.

850
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:07,429
(Man) Let's check it out.

851
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:45,828
How is he?

852
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:47,836
(Rumbling)

853
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:51,793
That's good. Processing very nicely.
All right, continue.

854
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:53,910
(Excited chatter)

855
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:10,148
- All right.
- I did it!

856
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:18,637
- That just about does it.
- He's not done yet.

857
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:21,638
He may take a while
with that last bite but it'll go.

858
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:24,240
- That ain't the last bite.
- Sure it is.

859
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:27,078
There's nothing left but gristle and fat.

860
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:31,034
- Oh, God, no.
- No problem.

861
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:33,674
(Roman) If I can get a dessert down him,

862
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:36,598
can we get some
Paul Bunyan hats for the kids?

863
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:39,473
- (Woman) Bye.
- (Applause)

864
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:43,319
Mom, can I go now?

865
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:46,272
They'll be telling their grandkids
about this.

866
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:48,436
(Roman) What a night!

867
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:50,391
Where's he going?

868
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:54,433
That Jimbo's not a bad guy.
I just had a word with him out back.

869
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:58,316
(Chittering) 'Where're the garbage cans?'

870
00:55:58,360 --> 00:56:00,874
'He probably put them in the cabin.'

871
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:02,433
'Garbage in the cabin?'

872
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:06,029
'They're not the cleanest species
on the face of the earth, you know.

873
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:08,799
'It's not a problem.
We'll just have to break in.'

874
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:10,671
'Can we do that?'

875
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:13,632
'What do you think we have these
wonderfully articulate fingers for?

876
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:15,591
'To scratch our asses!'

877
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:30,591
Shit!

878
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:50,279
- Oh, my God.
- Jesus.

879
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:53,710
(Roman) Look at the size of the maggots
on that meat.

880
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:58,271
Oh, honey!

881
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:03,390
(Chet retching)

882
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:05,476
(All screaming)

883
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:08,158
Oh, my God.

884
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:12,597
(Chet) Let's go everybody.
Move it out. It's 5am.

885
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:14,631
Fishing boat goes in 15 minutes.

886
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:16,910
(All groaning)

887
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:20,236
These are the biggest worms ever.

888
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:24,432
(Chet) They're leeches.
(Buck) I am not touching leeches!

889
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:27,233
- They don't bite.
- (Ben) No, they suck blood.

890
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:30,909
(Chet) Would you watch the hook?!
Where's the flashlight?

891
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:33,599
(Roman) Behind you.
You owe me big for this!

892
00:57:33,640 --> 00:57:35,631
(Big splash, Roman laughing)

893
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:37,671
(Chet) Very funny.

894
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:41,315
Give me a leech, will you?
Has everybody got their leech?

895
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:44,636
All right, on the count of three,
insert your hook.

896
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:47,752
One, two, three.

897
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:49,870
(All groan)

898
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:55,476
(Snoring)

899
00:57:57,360 --> 00:57:59,351
(Thunder rumbles)

900
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:04,075
(All screaming)

901
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:20,317
May I speak with Cammie?

902
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:22,794
Hold on just a minute. Cammie, phone.

903
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:27,473
Cammie's really busy,
may I take a message?

904
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:32,234
All right, just tell her that Buck called.

905
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:34,475
OK, fine, Buck. Goodbye.

906
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:49,799
- What are you up to?
- What's it look like?

907
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:53,879
- It looks like you're wanking your crank.
- I'm trying to build a fire.

908
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:56,434
You'll never get a fire going that way.

909
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:59,790
You don't crumple a newspaper up,
you twist it,

910
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:02,718
lengthwise, to simulate kindling.

911
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:08,078
Maybe, Roman, just maybe,
I'm trying to heat up the flue.

912
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:13,751
He's heating the flue. Meanwhile,
the humans are freezing to death.

913
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:17,918
- I'm really not cold. Not at all.
- Thank you for sharing that.

914
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:21,350
I'm so sorry, Roman. Forgive me.

915
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:24,233
Why don't you come over
and show me how to do it?

916
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:26,999
You talk a great game,
let's see some action.

917
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:31,511
After all, you know everything.
You always know exactly what to do.

918
00:59:31,560 --> 00:59:35,109
Katie, you were right,
we should have gone to Europe

919
00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:37,435
or Antarctica or the Dead Sea.

920
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:39,835
We would have had more fun.

921
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:44,635
Is that a fact? Nobody forced you
to come up here, buddy boy.

922
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:48,798
As a matter of fact,
I don't remember anybody inviting you.

923
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:50,751
Do you remember inviting him?

924
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:54,880
I sure as hell don't.

925
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:59,471
- And what does that statement mean?
- You figure it out for yourself.

926
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:03,911
You specify, you clarify for me.
Just as a common courtesy.

927
01:00:03,960 --> 01:00:08,715
- You know what he means.
- They're saying we're not welcome.

928
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:12,309
Oh! What did I hear? We've got a bingo!

929
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:15,079
You did figure it out, Kate.

930
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:19,671
So, now it's all starting to ooze out.
It's very interesting, isn't it?

931
01:00:19,720 --> 01:00:21,199
Yeah, very.

932
01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:25,756
Especially since we threw aside our
plans, and we had a great trip planned,

933
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:28,075
to come up here
to show these dead-asses

934
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:30,793
how to start to learn to have a good time.

935
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:33,308
Thanks for ruining my vacation.

936
01:00:34,360 --> 01:00:38,751
What was that? Ruining your vacation?
Is that what you said?

937
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:43,999
Oh, come on, I don't believe
I heard you say that.

938
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:47,157
- You'd better believe it.
- Don't push it.

939
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:51,273
You ain't even seen pushing yet.
The trouble with you, Ripley,

940
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:54,437
is you wouldn't know a good time
if it fell on you.

941
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:56,311
(Sighs)

942
01:00:56,360 --> 01:00:59,352
You got an awful lot of nerve,
a lot of nerve.

943
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:02,631
It's served me well.
I'm the one with the Mercedes.

944
01:01:02,680 --> 01:01:04,830
By the way, is it paid for?

945
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:07,872
- Are you jealous, Chester?
- Don't call me Chester.

946
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:10,992
Call me that and you'll go home
with a dent in your forehead.

947
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:15,431
- Yeah, that'll be the day.
- Would you like one to match his?

948
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:19,075
- You wanna go right now?
- Dad, no one's denting anybody.

949
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:22,396
- Thanks, Bucky.
- Bite the big one, Uncle Roman.

950
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:24,715
- Don't talk to adults that way.
- Why not?

951
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:28,070
- Because it's rude.
- Oh, blow it out your ass.

952
01:01:28,120 --> 01:01:31,271
- Let's go. Come on, girls.
- (Roman) Good idea.

953
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:35,233
(Chet) It's the first good idea you've had
since you've been here.

954
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:37,396
And don't steal any of our stuff.

955
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:40,716
- Ha! What stuff is there to steal?
- We got stuff!

956
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:45,311
- You're a louse.
- Well, go find yourself a spin cycle.

957
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:47,920
Yeah, go find yourself a spin cycle.

958
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:52,435
- What does that mean?
- Never mind.

959
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:55,916
- Dad?
- Yes, Ben.

960
01:01:55,960 --> 01:01:59,430
Does this mean we won't get
a present from Uncle Roman?

961
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:01,550
Blow it out your ass.

962
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:04,319
Nobody's blowing anything
out their ass.

963
01:02:04,360 --> 01:02:09,070
It's just a little problem, it doesn't mean
we don't love your uncle and aunt,

964
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:11,680
it just means
we are having some emotions.

965
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:15,633
What it means is that I'd like
to blow Uncle Roman out my ass.

966
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:19,912
I don't want any more about
anyone blowing anything out their ass.

967
01:02:19,960 --> 01:02:23,714
You might as well
blow the whole family out your ass, Dad.

968
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:27,958
Do you understand what's going on?
You understand what we're saying?

969
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,355
Aunt Kate and Uncle Roman
are buttheads.

970
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:31,549
Exactly.

971
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:47,034
All right, troops, mount up.
We're ready to roll.

972
01:02:47,080 --> 01:02:51,073
- You all packed?
- Actually, I was thinking things over.

973
01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:55,318
And I'm gonna tell you something
I had previously decided not to.

974
01:02:55,360 --> 01:02:57,351
I came up here for a reason.

975
01:02:58,840 --> 01:03:01,752
I came here to talk to you
about an investment.

976
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:05,475
In fact, I came up to solicit
$25,000 from you.

977
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:08,432
I knew it, I knew it, I knew it.

978
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:11,711
Look, a unique investment opportunity
came my way

979
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:15,958
and I'm thinking of people
that I'm gonna bless with this chance

980
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,560
cos this is so good it should be illegal.

981
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:21,034
- And it probably is.
- It's not.

982
01:03:21,080 --> 01:03:23,719
It's inside but it's not illegal.

983
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:26,797
The upside is phenomenal,
the downside is zip.

984
01:03:26,840 --> 01:03:30,719
I'm thinking about who I could involve
in this and your name came up.

985
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:33,832
Why? Because you are family.

986
01:03:33,880 --> 01:03:36,633
If a guy can't help his family,
what good is he?

987
01:03:36,680 --> 01:03:40,229
I came up here to offer you a chance
to make some big money.

988
01:03:40,280 --> 01:03:42,999
It's funny you didn't mention this before.

989
01:03:43,040 --> 01:03:46,715
- You didn't want to talk about money.
- Baloney!

990
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:50,594
(Roman) I was picking my moment.
(Chet) You were picking your nose.

991
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:54,915
There's no mystery here, Chet.

992
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:57,952
- I know how you really feel about me.
- Do you?

993
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,752
Yep.

994
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:03,429
I knew if I gave you something,
you'd figure there'd be strings.

995
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:06,199
- Is that a fact?
- Yeah, that's a fact.

996
01:04:08,080 --> 01:04:10,071
At our wedding...

997
01:04:11,120 --> 01:04:15,796
you were in the john, with Kate
and Connie's dad, you were talking.

998
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:20,231
Do you happen to remember
the substance of that conversation?

999
01:04:20,280 --> 01:04:22,669
- No, I don't.
- Well, I do.

1000
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:26,075
It's one I'll never forget

1001
01:04:26,120 --> 01:04:29,999
because I heard you say, and I quote,

1002
01:04:30,040 --> 01:04:33,555
"That Roman Craig
is a crooked son of a bitch."

1003
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:38,435
The next time you stab somebody in
the back, check under the stalls for feet.

1004
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:44,077
You may think I'm made out of armor
but I'm just like any other human being

1005
01:04:44,120 --> 01:04:46,998
and when I get cut it hurts
and that cut me.

1006
01:04:47,040 --> 01:04:49,190
And I hurt.

1007
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:53,349
Roman, I'm...

1008
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:55,391
I'm sorry, I...

1009
01:04:56,440 --> 01:04:59,671
I had a lot to drink that night and, er...

1010
01:04:59,720 --> 01:05:03,030
I really don't remember saying that
but if you said I did...

1011
01:05:04,680 --> 01:05:07,035
then...

1012
01:05:07,080 --> 01:05:09,230
I must have.

1013
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:14,515
I apologize to you both.
It was a terrible thing to say.

1014
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:20,475
I don't hold grudges
and I don't have any hard feelings.

1015
01:05:20,520 --> 01:05:22,670
To show you I can forgive and forget,

1016
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:26,395
I'd still like to offer you
a piece of that investment.

1017
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:30,357
Sweetie.

1018
01:05:31,600 --> 01:05:34,478
I don't know what to say, Roman, I...

1019
01:05:34,520 --> 01:05:36,511
I feel like a real idiot.

1020
01:05:37,560 --> 01:05:41,394
- What is this thing?
- 25,000. What's your cash position?

1021
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:46,872
It isn't 25,000,
that's an awful lot of money.

1022
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:49,434
Can you get it?

1023
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:50,959
No!

1024
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:56,632
I, er... I think I can make an arrangement
or two at the bank on Monday.

1025
01:05:56,680 --> 01:05:58,671
Look, whatever you want to do.

1026
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:03,157
You can write a cheque now
and I'll make up the difference.

1027
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:06,317
If that's OK?
Is your chequebook in the purse?

1028
01:06:06,360 --> 01:06:09,750
- Yeah.
- (Chet) Great. Then that's fine.

1029
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:17,956
- Bye.
- Goodbye.

1030
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:21,675
I think it's a real testament
to the strength of the family

1031
01:06:21,720 --> 01:06:23,950
that we can disagree so vehemently

1032
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:27,709
and get on each other's nerves so badly
over the past week

1033
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:29,751
and still part on good terms.

1034
01:06:29,800 --> 01:06:31,791
Absolutely.

1035
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,594
After all the disagreements you two had,

1036
01:06:35,640 --> 01:06:38,996
you still thought to include him
in that investment.

1037
01:06:39,040 --> 01:06:43,830
It was a wonderful moment of trust on
his part that he wrote you that cheque.

1038
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:48,829
That's a lot of money for him. From what
I gather, it's half a year's salary.

1039
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:52,111
It may well be
Ben and Buck's college money.

1040
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:57,075
You have a knack with money and I think
it's great you're sharing it with him

1041
01:06:57,120 --> 01:06:59,236
and that he accepted your offer,

1042
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:02,556
that he trusts you
with his financial wellbeing.

1043
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:06,275
Oh, I hope this investment
really works out for them.

1044
01:07:06,320 --> 01:07:07,753
(Tires screech)

1045
01:07:07,800 --> 01:07:11,839
- I got to go back.
- Did you forget something?

1046
01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:15,873
- You're scaring me, are you all right?
- I will be once I settle this.

1047
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:33,394
(Kate) Roman, what are you doing?

1048
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:35,715
- Katie, sit down.
- What?

1049
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:39,036
You'll need to sit down
to hear what I have to say.

1050
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:44,190
- Gee, it's wet.
- Hurry up.

1051
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:46,117
Let's go.

1052
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:51,314
Chet, I'm gonna level with you.
I'm a phony, a fraud, a fake.

1053
01:07:51,360 --> 01:07:56,354
From my imitation Bally slip-ons
to our replicated Rolexes.

1054
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:59,756
We're broke. We're bankrupt.
We're busted.

1055
01:07:59,800 --> 01:08:01,791
We're busted?

1056
01:08:03,640 --> 01:08:06,677
We were living well, right?
Well beyond our means.

1057
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:11,277
I haven't been trading in over two years.

1058
01:08:12,560 --> 01:08:15,313
This deal looked good,
I got overextended,

1059
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:19,638
couldn't meet my calls.
I lost my seat on the exchange.

1060
01:08:19,680 --> 01:08:22,148
I go to work every morning.

1061
01:08:22,200 --> 01:08:25,033
Now I wear a blue runner's jacket
and fetch coffee.

1062
01:08:25,080 --> 01:08:27,548
I lost everything.

1063
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:30,398
Did you think
that I wouldn't understand?

1064
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:32,908
Baby, I knew you'd understand

1065
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:37,556
but I also knew you wouldn't let me
put the bite on Connie and Chet.

1066
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:41,832
Look, Roman. You know I'd never
turn my back on family.

1067
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:44,235
I know, that's why I came up here.

1068
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:48,510
That story about you and your brother
in the can at the wedding,

1069
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:50,630
I made it up.

1070
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:56,348
You what? You made it up?

1071
01:09:04,440 --> 01:09:06,829
All right, all right. I got it, I got it.

1072
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:09,511
Holy...

1073
01:09:10,360 --> 01:09:12,430
Holy jeez.

1074
01:09:14,160 --> 01:09:16,720
Whoo.

1075
01:09:16,760 --> 01:09:19,877
- (Groaning)
- (Connie) What happened?

1076
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:23,230
- Power's out.
- Where's the flashlight?

1077
01:09:23,280 --> 01:09:25,919
- Chet?
- What happened to the lights?

1078
01:09:25,960 --> 01:09:27,996
You kids got the flashlight?

1079
01:09:28,040 --> 01:09:32,716
Look at this. $110 for a lighter,
it doesn't even work.

1080
01:09:32,760 --> 01:09:35,069
79 cents. Ha.

1081
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:37,031
Whoo! Hot!

1082
01:09:37,080 --> 01:09:40,277
I haven't seen weather like this for years.

1083
01:09:42,520 --> 01:09:45,398
Roman, where are the girls?

1084
01:09:46,720 --> 01:09:48,836
Have you seen them?

1085
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:50,871
- Have you seen them?
- No.

1086
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:55,232
Spread out, let's look for them.
They'll be hiding under a bed.

1087
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:03,238
- Come on, it's this way.
- No, it's this way. I remember.

1088
01:10:04,240 --> 01:10:06,356
That big hole.

1089
01:10:10,280 --> 01:10:13,238
- We'll find them.
- They're gonna be all right.

1090
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:15,191
Don't worry about a thing.

1091
01:10:15,240 --> 01:10:18,312
Boys, stay here.
Look after your mother and aunt.

1092
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:21,477
- We'll help you.
- There's too much lightning.

1093
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:24,512
- We're near the cave.
- Here's the fence.

1094
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:27,916
Wait for me.

1095
01:10:27,960 --> 01:10:30,758
Cara! Mara!

1096
01:10:33,280 --> 01:10:35,191
- Try this way.
- OK.

1097
01:10:35,240 --> 01:10:37,470
Thank you.

1098
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:40,988
There we go. There we go.

1099
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:46,233
We find the candles,
then the light comes back on.

1100
01:10:46,280 --> 01:10:48,714
I win.

1101
01:10:51,400 --> 01:10:56,155
- I found it. I wanna go first.
- No, I wanna. Me!

1102
01:10:56,200 --> 01:10:57,952
Hello!

1103
01:10:58,000 --> 01:10:59,797
(Both) Hello!

1104
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:02,950
(Screaming)

1105
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:13,833
- Cara! Mara!
- Girls!

1106
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:27,113
- Cara!
- Mara!

1107
01:11:27,160 --> 01:11:29,958
Girls! Cara, Mara!

1108
01:11:34,840 --> 01:11:37,593
Cara! Mara!

1109
01:11:37,640 --> 01:11:40,279
Help!

1110
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:42,470
Put your light up there.

1111
01:11:42,520 --> 01:11:44,556
There.

1112
01:11:45,560 --> 01:11:48,438
Girls, is that you?

1113
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:51,153
It's Uncle Chet. Are you all right?

1114
01:11:51,200 --> 01:11:54,670
- Help!
- We'll be right down. Go on.

1115
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:56,711
- Not me.
- What?

1116
01:11:56,760 --> 01:12:01,231
- I'm claustrophobic. What if I lose it?
- You won't lose it.

1117
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:04,078
- What if I blow it?
- We gotta get some help.

1118
01:12:04,120 --> 01:12:06,998
(Chet) We don't have time. You can do it.

1119
01:12:07,040 --> 01:12:10,157
They're your children. Be their father.

1120
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:13,510
For the first time in your life,
be their father.

1121
01:12:13,560 --> 01:12:16,677
Come on. Get in there
and help your kids.

1122
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:22,437
Your dad'll be right down.
Daddy's coming.

1123
01:12:22,480 --> 01:12:24,630
Let's go. You can do it.

1124
01:12:24,680 --> 01:12:27,240
- All right.
- Here we go.

1125
01:12:27,280 --> 01:12:30,556
I'm gonna go get a light
and some rope, OK?

1126
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:33,239
All right? Take it easy.

1127
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:37,990
Don't think about tight places
like a submarine or a coffin.

1128
01:12:38,040 --> 01:12:40,554
- Come back.
- I'll be back.

1129
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:51,600
No!

1130
01:12:54,560 --> 01:12:58,075
Oh. My little sweeties.

1131
01:12:58,120 --> 01:13:00,111
Oh, I love you.

1132
01:13:06,160 --> 01:13:10,119
Chet! They're all right!

1133
01:13:10,160 --> 01:13:12,833
Apollo unicell...

1134
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:15,671
It's dynamite.

1135
01:13:15,720 --> 01:13:17,676
Wet, old dynamite.

1136
01:13:19,400 --> 01:13:21,755
It's fine. It's fine.

1137
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:23,995
Chet. Chet!

1138
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:28,875
Ripley.

1139
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:31,718
OK, we want to get out of here.

1140
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:35,673
It's cold, it's wet
and you don't want to stay here.

1141
01:13:35,720 --> 01:13:38,792
You hang on to Daddy
as tight as you can.

1142
01:13:40,040 --> 01:13:42,110
OK. Come on.

1143
01:13:43,160 --> 01:13:46,675
Ooh! Ah! Ooh! Big one. Big spider.

1144
01:13:46,720 --> 01:13:51,589
OK, climb on, Cara.
Mara, get on your sister's back.

1145
01:13:51,640 --> 01:13:55,315
Grab hold of my jacket. Hang on tight.

1146
01:13:57,960 --> 01:14:00,076
OK, my babies.

1147
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:13,796
Which way?

1148
01:14:15,640 --> 01:14:18,518
Hang on, we're almost there.

1149
01:14:25,880 --> 01:14:27,916
Jeez, damn.

1150
01:14:27,960 --> 01:14:29,916
Come on.

1151
01:14:32,440 --> 01:14:34,715
Go, Cara. Go!

1152
01:14:47,320 --> 01:14:50,039
Let's go back to the cabin.

1153
01:14:51,560 --> 01:14:54,757
Your mother's probably
worried sick about you.

1154
01:14:56,680 --> 01:14:58,477
Here we go. OK.

1155
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:02,309
Hang on. Hang on.

1156
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:06,877
Roman, girls, I'm back.

1157
01:15:06,920 --> 01:15:09,115
I got everything. I'm here.

1158
01:15:09,160 --> 01:15:13,039
I'll have you out in a second.
Just a minute. Hold on.

1159
01:15:13,080 --> 01:15:16,231
I'm sorry it took so long. I'll explain later.

1160
01:15:17,240 --> 01:15:20,038
Just a sec. Get off me. I got a rope.

1161
01:15:20,520 --> 01:15:24,433
You'll be fine. I'm gonna tie a rope
at the end of this thing.

1162
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:26,436
I'm gonna throw it down

1163
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:30,792
and, one at a time, I'll pull you up, OK?

1164
01:15:30,840 --> 01:15:34,116
Here comes the rope. Watch your heads.

1165
01:15:34,160 --> 01:15:36,230
Here it comes.

1166
01:15:40,360 --> 01:15:43,193
All right, have you got it?

1167
01:15:45,320 --> 01:15:48,357
OK. You got it? Good.

1168
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:52,313
You let me know when
you're ready to come up, OK?

1169
01:15:52,360 --> 01:15:54,749
Then I'll pull you up.

1170
01:15:55,680 --> 01:15:57,636
Fine, you're ready.

1171
01:15:57,680 --> 01:15:59,511
Just a second.

1172
01:15:59,560 --> 01:16:04,236
OK, girls, Uncle Chet's here. OK.

1173
01:16:04,280 --> 01:16:06,840
Roman, you could help, you know.

1174
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:11,112
All right. One, two, three, go.

1175
01:16:12,920 --> 01:16:15,036
Hey, what the hell are you doing?

1176
01:16:16,120 --> 01:16:19,590
When I say ready, huh?
When I say ready.

1177
01:16:19,640 --> 01:16:22,029
All right. I'm ready.

1178
01:16:25,640 --> 01:16:28,200
Come on. Help out a bit, will you?

1179
01:16:29,880 --> 01:16:32,713
Here it comes.
We'll be going home soon.

1180
01:16:35,200 --> 01:16:38,192
Roman and I are going to
have a talk, later on.

1181
01:16:38,240 --> 01:16:41,312
We're going to talk about helping people.

1182
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:45,035
OK. Here we go.
Everybody help Uncle Chet.

1183
01:16:45,080 --> 01:16:46,877
Come on.

1184
01:16:49,400 --> 01:16:52,278
We did it. I did it.

1185
01:17:01,960 --> 01:17:03,871
A baldheaded bear!

1186
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:06,434
(Screams)

1187
01:17:23,560 --> 01:17:25,869
(Bear growls, Chet screams)

1188
01:17:30,840 --> 01:17:32,910
Whoa!

1189
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:35,076
Nice bear. Oh, God.

1190
01:17:38,200 --> 01:17:40,668
I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die!

1191
01:17:40,720 --> 01:17:42,233
No, I'm not.

1192
01:17:42,280 --> 01:17:44,350
Leave me alone. Go away.

1193
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:46,868
I gotta move faster.

1194
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,275
He's back, everybody.

1195
01:18:05,320 --> 01:18:07,515
Chet! Hi.

1196
01:18:07,560 --> 01:18:11,838
- Where the hell were you?
- Come in, I'm making you a sandwich.

1197
01:18:11,880 --> 01:18:14,235
Big, big, whoo big...

1198
01:18:14,280 --> 01:18:16,077
All right, we'll make a big one.

1199
01:18:16,120 --> 01:18:18,873
- Big bear.
- Big bear!

1200
01:18:18,920 --> 01:18:22,037
No! True. True. Out there.

1201
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:24,435
We're glad you're home, honey.

1202
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:27,552
- Big bear... chase...
- What is he saying?

1203
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:30,239
- What?
- Big bear chase me.

1204
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:32,792
(Growling)

1205
01:18:37,480 --> 01:18:41,359
Up the stairs! Get upstairs!
Oh, my God, it's a bear!

1206
01:18:43,200 --> 01:18:45,475
It's a bear, it's a bear!

1207
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:47,875
Get off, you son of a bitch.

1208
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:53,837
Roman! Roman! Wow! Wow!

1209
01:18:55,360 --> 01:18:57,396
Uncle, uncle, uncle.

1210
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:02,834
Oh, my God. Protect us!

1211
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:04,598
Hold on.

1212
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:07,991
Mom.

1213
01:19:15,440 --> 01:19:18,000
Connie, stay down.

1214
01:19:28,720 --> 01:19:31,188
Hit him with the poker.

1215
01:19:37,280 --> 01:19:39,111
Look out!

1216
01:19:46,240 --> 01:19:48,834
Big bear... Big bear chase me.

1217
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:58,436
This big.

1218
01:20:09,800 --> 01:20:13,475
- Thank God you're here.
- Shoot him.

1219
01:20:13,520 --> 01:20:16,671
- It's a goddamn lamp.
- But it's loaded.

1220
01:20:16,720 --> 01:20:18,756
I can't hold out much longer!

1221
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:21,109
- Quit pushing me.
- Give it me.

1222
01:20:24,920 --> 01:20:26,194
Shoot him.

1223
01:20:27,960 --> 01:20:30,554
Oh! Right in the...

1224
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:32,830
(Bear squealing)

1225
01:20:43,400 --> 01:20:45,630
(Squealing continues)

1226
01:20:47,240 --> 01:20:49,196
OK, let's roll.

1227
01:20:49,240 --> 01:20:51,993
Can't believe that I'm gonna
miss this place.

1228
01:20:52,040 --> 01:20:54,235
- Uncle Chet.
- Yes, sweetheart.

1229
01:20:54,280 --> 01:20:57,670
- I had a really good time.
- Well, I'm glad.

1230
01:20:57,720 --> 01:21:01,713
- Thanks, Uncle Chet.
- My pleasure, sweetheart.

1231
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:05,150
We had a nice time having you.
We're gonna miss you.

1232
01:21:05,200 --> 01:21:08,431
Will I see you soon?
And don't drive too fast.

1233
01:21:08,480 --> 01:21:12,837
- Take your seats, in the trunk.
- (Kate) Knock it off.

1234
01:21:14,840 --> 01:21:17,832
Cammie, if you're out there...

1235
01:21:17,880 --> 01:21:21,998
I just want you to know
I don't blame you for hating me.

1236
01:21:22,040 --> 01:21:25,237
(Cammie) City boys
always talk to themselves?

1237
01:21:31,320 --> 01:21:33,515
Look, I'm really sorry.

1238
01:21:33,560 --> 01:21:37,553
I want you to go back to Chicago
a crazed, lovesick maniac.

1239
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:41,593
When you look at another girl,
you'll compare her to me.

1240
01:21:41,640 --> 01:21:43,870
Sounds good to me.

1241
01:21:48,600 --> 01:21:52,513
- You're a good man. You're the best.
- You're not so bad.

1242
01:21:53,960 --> 01:21:57,748
- You drive safely.
- Thanks.

1243
01:21:57,800 --> 01:22:00,234
- Race you home.
- You got it.

1244
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:04,036
Race you home.

1245
01:22:05,400 --> 01:22:07,550
Take care.

1246
01:22:09,080 --> 01:22:11,196
Bye-bye.

1247
01:22:14,040 --> 01:22:16,315
Race you home.

1248
01:22:18,360 --> 01:22:21,557
Why would he say that?
He lives out in Oak Park.

1249
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:23,716
It's just till he gets on his feet.

1250
01:22:23,760 --> 01:22:27,594
I think you should be proud of him
not taking your loan.

1251
01:22:27,640 --> 01:22:31,679
- What are you saying?
- We have plenty of room.

1252
01:22:31,720 --> 01:22:33,790
He is not staying at our house.

1253
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:36,832
If he beats us, he'll get
the good spot in the garage.

1254
01:22:36,920 --> 01:22:39,912
- To the memories.
- To the memories.

1255
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:43,430
- Chester!
- Buckley!

1256
01:22:43,480 --> 01:22:47,951
Get in the car, we've got to beat
Roman home. Move it.
