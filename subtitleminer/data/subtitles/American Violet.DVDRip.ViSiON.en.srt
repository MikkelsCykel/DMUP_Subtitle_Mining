00:22:49,705 --> 00:22:51,764
"You know how many times I've
been through this with you?

498
00:22:51,874 --> 00:22:53,364
"I'm gonna tell you right now,
you gonna have to arrest me,

499
00:22:53,475 --> 00:22:54,464
'cause I don't give a shit"-

500
00:22:54,576 --> 00:22:56,203
- Excuse me.

501
00:22:56,311 --> 00:22:58,905
Do y'all know
where I might find Judge Pryor?

502
00:22:59,014 --> 00:23:01,744
[Knocking on door]

503
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:02,839
- Judge Pryor?

504
00:23:02,951 --> 00:23:04,282
- Yes, Sam?

505
00:23:04,386 --> 00:23:06,286
- I have someone here
who'd like to speak with you.

506
00:23:06,388 --> 00:23:07,855
- Yeah, come on in.

507
00:23:07,956 --> 00:23:09,753
- Appreciate it.

508
00:23:09,858 --> 00:23:11,758
- And I think
the U.S. Supreme Court-

509
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:14,328
- We-
we've counted all the votes.

510
00:23:14,429 --> 00:23:16,090
We counted them
on election day.

511
00:23:16,198 --> 00:23:17,927
- We haven't counted them.
- The machine...

512
00:23:18,033 --> 00:23:19,796
- Hey, y'all.

513
00:23:19,902 --> 00:23:21,301
- Hi, Alma.

514
00:23:21,403 --> 00:23:22,734
- Girl, how you doing?

515
00:23:22,838 --> 00:23:25,272
- This is what
I called y'all about.

516
00:23:25,374 --> 00:23:28,138
- Girl, how Dee doing?
We sure miss her.

517
00:23:28,243 --> 00:23:29,972
- She-
she all right.

518
00:23:30,078 --> 00:23:32,410
The judge say
he'll lower Dee's bail

519
00:23:32,514 --> 00:23:34,004
if enough folks
sign this here.

520
00:23:34,116 --> 00:23:38,280
It say you have never seened her
doing or selling drugs.

521
00:23:38,387 --> 00:23:40,378
That color's
sure looking good on you, girl.

522
00:23:40,489 --> 00:23:42,047
- I love it.
I love it.

523
00:23:42,157 --> 00:23:43,488
- I think
I want to bump it up, though.

524
00:23:43,592 --> 00:23:44,786
- Give Dee our love.

525
00:23:44,893 --> 00:23:47,384
- And tell her we sure
miss her around here, okay?

526
00:23:47,496 --> 00:23:48,656
- Y'all know I will.

527
00:23:49,698 --> 00:23:52,826
Tamika,
I need you to sign.

528
00:23:53,468 --> 00:23:54,526
[Chatter]

529
00:23:54,603 --> 00:23:55,900
- Listen up.
Listen to me now.

530
00:23:56,004 --> 00:23:56,993
Listen to me.

531
00:23:57,105 --> 00:23:58,402
Year after year,

532
00:23:58,507 --> 00:24:02,603
we have endured these raids
on our community.

533
00:24:02,711 --> 00:24:06,545
And I, for one,
have had enough.

534
00:24:06,648 --> 00:24:09,845
So I put in a call
to my old friend

535
00:24:09,952 --> 00:24:13,251
Joe Fischer
up at Baylor Law School.

536
00:24:13,355 --> 00:24:15,915
Professor Fischer
has a long history

537
00:24:16,024 --> 00:24:18,822
of fighting
for what's right here in Texas.

538
00:24:18,927 --> 00:24:20,121
And we thank him for that.

539
00:24:20,229 --> 00:24:24,359
[Applause]

540
00:24:24,466 --> 00:24:27,458
Well, Joe didn't let us down,

541
00:24:27,569 --> 00:24:28,900
'cause next thing I know,

542
00:24:29,004 --> 00:24:33,236
I'm talking to a Mr. David Cohen
at the ACLU.

543
00:24:33,342 --> 00:24:34,900
Mr. Cohen,
thank you.

544
00:24:35,010 --> 00:24:36,534
Thank you for coming.

545
00:24:36,645 --> 00:24:38,408
- Thank you, Reverend.

546
00:24:38,513 --> 00:24:40,777
My associate
Byron Hill and I

547
00:24:40,882 --> 00:24:44,079
appreciate your inviting us
here tonight.

548
00:24:44,186 --> 00:24:48,350
What's happening in Melody is
happening all over our country.

549
00:24:48,457 --> 00:24:51,290
Drug task forces
use military tactics

550
00:24:51,393 --> 00:24:53,293
to terrorize poor people.

551
00:24:53,395 --> 00:24:57,525
And drug laws selectively target
people of color.

552
00:24:57,633 --> 00:25:01,296
Meanwhile, federal money
goes to the counties

553
00:25:01,403 --> 00:25:03,132
that convict
the most people.

554
00:25:03,238 --> 00:25:06,730
And plea bargains
are aggressively pushed

555
00:25:06,842 --> 00:25:09,606
to hasten those convictions.

556
00:25:09,711 --> 00:25:12,680
Now, can anyone guess
what percentage

557
00:25:12,781 --> 00:25:15,045
of the criminal cases
in our country

558
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:16,913
are settled
by plea bargains?

559
00:25:20,322 --> 00:25:21,983
Just guess.

560
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:25,548
How many folks never see
a jury of their peers?

561
00:25:25,661 --> 00:25:26,753
- Half.

562
00:25:26,862 --> 00:25:28,989
- 95%.

563
00:25:29,097 --> 00:25:33,090
For most people, the penalties
of not taking the plea

564
00:25:33,201 --> 00:25:35,101
are so frightening
that even if they're innocent,

565
00:25:35,203 --> 00:25:36,397
they plead guilty.

566
00:25:36,505 --> 00:25:38,268
- My son James got arrested
up in the projects.

567
00:25:38,373 --> 00:25:39,362
- Uh-huh.

568
00:25:39,474 --> 00:25:40,600
- Can you
help him post bail?

569
00:25:40,709 --> 00:25:45,305
- The ACLU
does not post bail money.

570
00:25:45,414 --> 00:25:47,712
But we do offer
legal advice

571
00:25:47,816 --> 00:25:48,976
and expert testimony.

572
00:25:49,084 --> 00:25:51,746
- Young man,
I'm grateful for your offer,

573
00:25:51,853 --> 00:25:54,754
but I don't know
that an ACLU Yankee lawyer

574
00:25:54,856 --> 00:25:56,847
can help my child
with no Texas jury.

575
00:25:56,958 --> 00:26:01,088
- Look, he's here,
and he wants to help.

576
00:26:01,196 --> 00:26:03,960
'Cause there ain't no way
my son gonna get a fair trial

577
00:26:04,066 --> 00:26:06,534
as long as Beckett
cuts the cords.

578
00:26:06,635 --> 00:26:10,537
Now, the DA wants Brian
to take an eight-year plea.

579
00:26:10,639 --> 00:26:14,666
If he doesn't,
they pushing for 25 years.

580
00:26:14,776 --> 00:26:20,009
- The story you're telling
is exactly why we're here.

581
00:26:20,115 --> 00:26:25,018
- Our oldest boy
fought charges three years ago.

582
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,782
He didn't stand a chance.

583
00:26:27,889 --> 00:26:30,756
He's in for 15 years.

584
00:26:33,628 --> 00:26:38,258
- Yeah, yeah, something
really exciting and fun.

585
00:26:38,367 --> 00:26:40,665
- [Baby talk]

586
00:26:40,769 --> 00:26:43,135
- Count to 17.

587
00:26:43,238 --> 00:26:44,865
- That could be fun.

588
00:26:44,973 --> 00:26:47,339
Well, do you want to start it
or shall I?

589
00:26:47,442 --> 00:26:48,841
- I'll start it, Big Bird.

590
00:26:48,944 --> 00:26:51,469
- Okay, you start.

591
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:53,946
- One...
- Two...

592
00:26:54,049 --> 00:26:56,017
- Tanya, come on, so I can
change your diaper, girl.

593
00:26:56,118 --> 00:26:57,176
Come on.

594
00:26:57,285 --> 00:26:59,150
- Three?
- Three!

595
00:26:59,254 --> 00:27:00,721
Yeah, three!

596
00:27:00,822 --> 00:27:03,290
Then we have, um...

597
00:27:03,392 --> 00:27:04,381
four!

598
00:27:04,493 --> 00:27:06,518
- Come on, Tanya.
Your diaper got to be full.

599
00:27:06,628 --> 00:27:10,325
- [Laughing]

600
00:27:10,432 --> 00:27:12,696
- Five!

601
00:27:12,801 --> 00:27:17,534
- Texas law says
a grand jury

602
00:27:17,639 --> 00:27:20,506
can indict them on the word
of a single informant.

603
00:27:20,609 --> 00:27:23,134
- So all I have to do
is accuse you...

604
00:27:23,245 --> 00:27:25,975
- And then I can be indicted
and arrested,

605
00:27:26,081 --> 00:27:28,481
and I'm told
to take the plea or else.

606
00:27:28,583 --> 00:27:30,778
- And this system
is an abomination.

607
00:27:30,886 --> 00:27:33,582
Poor black folks
are easy pickins.

608
00:27:33,688 --> 00:27:35,246
- But we can
change the system.

609
00:27:35,357 --> 00:27:38,554
We're gonna hit this DA
really hard.

610
00:27:41,329 --> 00:27:43,092
- Up in the city,

611
00:27:43,198 --> 00:27:45,029
a DA
may not be a big deal,

612
00:27:45,133 --> 00:27:47,567
but down here,

613
00:27:47,669 --> 00:27:50,729
he rules like a king.

614
00:27:50,839 --> 00:27:53,933
Beckett's been the DA
for nine years.

615
00:27:54,042 --> 00:28:01,505
White folks vote for him
'cause he keeps the town quiet.

616
00:28:01,616 --> 00:28:04,983
Black folks...

617
00:28:05,086 --> 00:28:07,020
half of 'em
are too lazy to vote,

618
00:28:07,122 --> 00:28:11,388
and the other half can't vote
'cause they're felons.

619
00:28:11,493 --> 00:28:17,625
I'll find you
your lead plaintiff,

620
00:28:17,732 --> 00:28:21,498
but they gonna be in
for a hell of a ride.

621
00:28:30,545 --> 00:28:33,412
- Roberts.

622
00:28:33,515 --> 00:28:34,880
Your lawyer's here.

623
00:28:34,983 --> 00:28:36,177
- You got
what I been asking for?

624
00:28:36,284 --> 00:28:37,581
I really need 'em.

625
00:28:37,686 --> 00:28:40,621
- You too good to wad up toilet
paper like everybody else?

626
00:28:40,722 --> 00:28:42,713
Let's go.

627
00:28:42,824 --> 00:28:46,351
- DA's
playing hardball with us.

628
00:28:46,461 --> 00:28:48,019
He says he might
withdraw his plea offer

629
00:28:48,129 --> 00:28:49,756
if you don't take it soon.

630
00:28:56,238 --> 00:28:59,901
Look, I've learned a little bit
about their case.

631
00:29:00,008 --> 00:29:02,238
All right,
the DA has an informant

632
00:29:02,344 --> 00:29:04,904
and audio tapes
of people selling him drugs.

633
00:29:05,013 --> 00:29:07,038
The informant claims
he bought crack from you.

634
00:29:07,148 --> 00:29:08,877
The tapes confirm it.

635
00:29:08,984 --> 00:29:12,886
And two police offers say
they witnessed the whole thing.

636
00:29:15,991 --> 00:29:17,982
It's pretty strong stuff,
Miss Roberts.

637
00:29:21,463 --> 00:29:22,953
- It's bullshit.

638

[Gunshots]

639
00:29:30,772 --> 00:29:34,037
- Sam Conroy?

640
00:29:34,142 --> 00:29:35,234
- Yeah.

641
00:29:35,343 --> 00:29:37,834
- Hi, I'm David Cohen
with the ACLU.

642
00:29:37,946 --> 00:29:40,312
Joe Fischer up at Baylor
told me I might find you here.

643
00:29:40,415 --> 00:29:42,542
Do you have a second?

644
00:29:42,651 --> 00:29:45,518
There's a case I'd like
to discuss with you.

645
00:29:49,658 --> 00:29:53,355
- Girl, anyone that can make
Laquathia look that good

646
00:29:53,461 --> 00:29:54,928
is a damn genius.

647
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:56,292
- You just jealous.

648
00:29:56,398 --> 00:29:57,865
- [Chuckles]

649
00:29:59,067 --> 00:30:00,967
- Gladys Williams?

650
00:30:01,069 --> 00:30:03,401
Come on,
you're going home.

651
00:30:03,505 --> 00:30:05,132
- Going home?
Gladys?

652
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,229
- I took the plea.

653
00:30:06,341 --> 00:30:08,673
I'm sorry.

654
00:30:08,777 --> 00:30:10,176
I'm just
not as strong as you are.

655
00:30:13,381 --> 00:30:14,575
- Don't-
don't worry about it.

656
00:30:14,683 --> 00:30:18,676
Gladys, you got to do
what you think is right.

657
00:30:18,787 --> 00:30:23,247
So you know...

658
00:30:23,358 --> 00:30:24,347
All right.

659
00:30:24,459 --> 00:30:25,824
- Bye, girl.

660
00:30:28,897 --> 00:30:30,728
- Say hi to my babies.

00:31:11,473 --> 00:31:12,838
- Leona?

662
00:31:12,941 --> 00:31:14,431
- Hey.

663
00:31:14,542 --> 00:31:16,203
- Hey.

664
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:21,178
I got your medication.

665
00:31:23,051 --> 00:31:24,279
How are you feeling?

666
00:31:24,386 --> 00:31:27,014
- I'm good.

667
00:31:27,122 --> 00:31:28,111
Thank you.

- [Mumbling]

669
00:31:33,895 --> 00:31:35,419
- What are you reading?

670
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:37,623
You've been snortin'
and sputterin' over there

671
00:31:37,732 --> 00:31:38,721
for an hour.

672
00:31:38,833 --> 00:31:40,198
- Well,
this background on a case

673
00:31:40,301 --> 00:31:42,326
Joe Fischer
recommended me for.

674
00:31:42,437 --> 00:31:44,064
- Joe Fischer?
- Yeah.

675
00:31:44,172 --> 00:31:46,163
- Well, that's flattering.

676
00:31:46,274 --> 00:31:47,434
- Well, I suppose.

677
00:31:47,542 --> 00:31:52,479
But what it is
is that the ACLU

678
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:55,208
is trying to sue
Calvin Beckett

679
00:31:55,316 --> 00:31:56,578
and a whole lot
of other people,

680
00:31:56,685 --> 00:31:59,984
including your employer,
the sheriff,

681
00:32:00,088 --> 00:32:02,386
'cause of the raids
down in Melody.

682
00:32:02,490 --> 00:32:05,789
They're claiming
it's a racial thing,

683
00:32:05,894 --> 00:32:07,122
racial bias.

684
00:32:11,366 --> 00:32:12,355
- You think it's true?

685
00:32:12,467 --> 00:32:15,527
- Maybe.

686
00:32:15,637 --> 00:32:18,470
Probably.

687
00:32:18,573 --> 00:32:20,473
Maybe.

688
00:32:20,575 --> 00:32:24,409
But you know, racist intent
is very hard to prove.

689
00:32:24,512 --> 00:32:29,108
And I mean,
I got to work down here.

690
00:32:29,217 --> 00:32:32,015
I don't want to get tagged
with the ACLU people.

691
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,519
That's...

692
00:32:33,621 --> 00:32:35,054
- So you're not
gonna do it?

693
00:32:35,156 --> 00:32:36,487
- I don't know.

694
00:32:39,928 --> 00:32:41,156
I don't know.

[Indecipherable speech]

697
00:33:43,525 --> 00:33:46,050
- I didn't order apple pie.

698
00:33:46,161 --> 00:33:49,324
I ordered tuna on rye.

699
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:52,058
The pie
rhymes with the rye.

700
00:33:52,167 --> 00:33:53,429
- Oh.

701

[Door opens]

Come here.
Come to your mommy.

706
00:34:02,544 --> 00:34:04,341
- They got me
watching <i>Sesame Street,</i>

707
00:34:04,445 --> 00:34:05,776
and I don't like that show.

Oh, dang.

00:34:10,785 --> 00:34:11,945
- Oh.

she was coming back.

Yeah.

716
00:34:20,395 --> 00:34:22,192
- Where Sherice at?

717
00:34:43,818 --> 00:34:46,753
Mm.

00:34:46,855 --> 00:34:48,823

[Chuckles]

Looks like it need
a little bit of a treatment.

00:34:57,699 --> 00:34:59,633
Mind if we work on it tonight?

722
00:35:07,642 --> 00:35:09,803
You been scared
I wasn't coming home?

It's okay, baby.

I'm here now, okay?

I'll never...

I won't let
anything happen to you.

All right, baby?

729
00:36:28,823 --> 00:36:30,757
- Let there be no doubt,

730

while I strongly disagree
with the court's decision,

731
00:36:34,629 --> 00:36:35,618
I accept it.

- Whole system's crazy, Dee.

735
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:46,830
Take the Mexicans.

736
00:36:46,941 --> 00:36:48,636
No one else
will work in the kitchen.

737
00:36:48,743 --> 00:36:50,074
But if you hire them,

738

government comes and busts
for hiring illegals.

I need my job back.

you been working here?

00:37:00,388 --> 00:37:03,323
Six?
- Seven.

742
00:37:03,424 --> 00:37:07,588
- Dee, after the police
came and got you,

743
00:37:07,695 --> 00:37:09,219
they came back...

744
00:37:09,330 --> 00:37:10,820
twice.

745
00:37:10,932 --> 00:37:13,162
First time,
looking for drugs in your stuff.

746
00:37:13,267 --> 00:37:14,598
And then a week later,

747
00:37:14,702 --> 00:37:17,569
to talk to me about the papers
on my guys in the kitchen.

748
00:37:21,209 --> 00:37:23,439
I can't be fighting
with the DA.

749
00:37:26,814 --> 00:37:28,008

00:37:28,116 --> 00:37:29,276
- Please, take it.

00:37:29,384 --> 00:37:31,784
- Don't worry about it.
- Take it.

752
00:37:31,886 --> 00:37:33,786
Please.

753
00:37:39,594 --> 00:37:41,255
- Thank you.

00:37:41,362 --> 00:37:44,126
- You're welcome.

755
00:37:44,232 --> 00:37:46,826
- Um...

756
00:37:46,934 --> 00:37:48,834
I'm sorry.

757
00:37:48,936 --> 00:37:49,925
- Me too.

758
00:38:20,868 --> 00:38:22,597
- So did you get a chance
to read the material

759
00:38:22,703 --> 00:38:23,727
that I gave you?

760
00:38:23,838 --> 00:38:26,773
- What do you need
local counsel for?

761
00:38:26,874 --> 00:38:28,842
Doesn't the ACLU
have enough lawyers?

762
00:38:28,943 --> 00:38:31,503
- We need insight
into the local justice system.

763
00:38:31,612 --> 00:38:32,601
- It's simple.

764
00:38:32,713 --> 00:38:34,578
The DA
decides what he wants,

765
00:38:34,682 --> 00:38:35,808
the cops
go and get it for him,

766
00:38:35,917 --> 00:38:38,215
and the judges
bless what they have done.

767
00:38:40,254 --> 00:38:42,916
- Are you hostile toward
this case for some reason,

768
00:38:43,024 --> 00:38:44,218
Mr. Conroy?

769
00:38:46,094 --> 00:38:48,085
- Mr. Cohen, when Joe Fischer
recommended me to you,

770
00:38:48,196 --> 00:38:49,857
did he tell you,
before I became a lawyer,

771
00:38:49,964 --> 00:38:51,261
I'd been a drug cop
for ten years

772
00:38:51,365 --> 00:38:53,060
and that I trained
the task force officers

773
00:38:53,167 --> 00:38:54,464
you're planning on suing?

774
00:38:56,370 --> 00:38:59,464
- Mr. Fischer told me
you were a man of principle,

775
00:38:59,574 --> 00:39:00,973
a fair man.

776
00:39:01,075 --> 00:39:02,565
Does what happened
at Arlington Springs

777
00:39:02,677 --> 00:39:03,735
seem fair to you?

778
00:39:03,845 --> 00:39:06,439
- Not much
seems fair to me these days,

779
00:39:06,547 --> 00:39:08,515
Mr. Cohen,
so I deal in practicalities.

780
00:39:08,616 --> 00:39:11,380
You're asking me to sue
everybody I ever met

781
00:39:11,486 --> 00:39:12,748
for racial discrimination.

782
00:39:12,854 --> 00:39:14,446
Now, you know
where we are down here?

783
00:39:14,555 --> 00:39:16,921
You might as well ask me
to stick a shotgun up my ass

784
00:39:17,024 --> 00:39:19,254
and blow my head off.

785
00:39:21,596 --> 00:39:24,656
- Well, that's very colorful.

786
00:39:24,765 --> 00:39:27,097
I apologize
for wasting your time.

787
00:39:33,007 --> 00:39:34,235
- You don't
have to be sorry.

788
00:39:34,342 --> 00:39:35,900
You're just doing
what you think is right,

789
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:38,706
and despite how it may look,
so am I.

790
00:39:41,115 --> 00:39:43,447
But I got to live down here.

791
00:39:43,551 --> 00:39:46,486
You're gonna be able to go back
where you come from.

792
00:39:46,587 --> 00:39:47,986
I'm gonna ask you again.

793
00:39:48,089 --> 00:39:49,954
Why do you want
local counsel?

794
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:55,795
- We intend
to file very quickly.

795
00:39:55,897 --> 00:39:59,355
To handle discovery,
depositions,

796
00:39:59,467 --> 00:40:01,332
and a trial,

797
00:40:01,435 --> 00:40:05,428
I need somebody who knows
how to navigate shit down here,

798
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:10,239
somebody to whom witnesses
and a local jury can relate.

799
00:40:10,344 --> 00:40:13,279
I think we both know
that isn't me.

801
00:40:17,485 --> 00:40:19,453
Well, that's a sensible answer
there, Mr. Cohen.

Who is your plaintiff?

804

- Hello.
Is your mom home?

805
00:40:30,064 --> 00:40:31,827
- Who's that, Sherice?

806
00:40:33,868 --> 00:40:35,733
- Hi, are you Dee Roberts?

807
00:40:35,836 --> 00:40:36,928
- Mm-hmm.

808
00:40:37,038 --> 00:40:40,269

Reverend Sanders suggested
that we come talk to you.

811
00:40:47,582 --> 00:40:50,312
- Reverend Sanders?

812
00:40:50,418 --> 00:40:51,407
Mm-hmm.

813
00:40:51,519 --> 00:40:52,508
Okay.

814
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:54,781
Bye, babies.

Get into Mommy's room.

Got a visitor.

817
00:40:57,458 --> 00:41:00,018
Sharonda, make sure your
sisters keep quiet, all right?

818
00:41:02,263 --> 00:41:03,958
All right.

819
00:41:04,065 --> 00:41:06,158
- So, Miss Roberts,

820
00:41:06,267 --> 00:41:08,758
what has happened to you
and others here in Melody

821
00:41:08,869 --> 00:41:10,598
is simply wrong.

822
00:41:10,705 --> 00:41:13,936
The ACLU wants to make sure
that it doesn't happen again.

823
00:41:14,041 --> 00:41:17,135
And we plan to sue
the district attorney,

824
00:41:17,245 --> 00:41:18,610
the county,

825
00:41:18,713 --> 00:41:20,010
the drug task force,

826
00:41:20,114 --> 00:41:23,880
and the policemen
involved in the raids.

827
00:41:23,985 --> 00:41:27,751
We'd like to do it
in your name.

828
00:41:27,855 --> 00:41:29,846
- Are you kidding me?

829
00:41:29,957 --> 00:41:32,255
You want her to sue
Calvin Beckett?

830
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,691
- Yes, ma'am.

831
00:41:33,794 --> 00:41:35,193
- Y'all must be
the ones doing drugs

832
00:41:35,296 --> 00:41:37,890
if you think my daughter's
gonna sue the DA

833
00:41:37,999 --> 00:41:40,695
and Harmon County,
Texas.

834
00:41:40,801 --> 00:41:43,565
- Would y'all excuse me
for a second, please?

835
00:41:47,708 --> 00:41:49,005
- Huh.

836
00:41:55,583 --> 00:41:56,572
Hey.

837
00:41:56,684 --> 00:41:58,345
Mm-mm.
Mm-mm.

838
00:42:00,688 --> 00:42:04,488
Since when
did you start smoking?

839
00:42:04,592 --> 00:42:06,583
- Since I spent
21 days in jail.

840
00:42:06,694 --> 00:42:09,185
- I can't believe Reverend
Sanders sent them round here,

841
00:42:09,297 --> 00:42:11,322
talking about sue Beckett.

842
00:42:11,432 --> 00:42:12,956
You can't beat Beckett.

843
00:42:13,067 --> 00:42:14,500
- I would need to.

844
00:42:14,602 --> 00:42:16,229
He wants to put me in prison
for 16 years.

845
00:42:16,337 --> 00:42:18,635
- Beckett
don't care nothing about you.

846
00:42:18,739 --> 00:42:20,366
You take the plea,
he will leave you alone.

847
00:42:20,474 --> 00:42:21,566
You stay to yourself,

848
00:42:21,676 --> 00:42:23,109
he ain't gonna bother you
never again.

849
00:42:23,210 --> 00:42:24,871
- Why should I
have to keep to myself?

850
00:42:24,979 --> 00:42:26,879
I did not do anything.

851
00:42:26,981 --> 00:42:28,573
- Dee,
it ain't always about you.

852
00:42:28,683 --> 00:42:29,980
You got kids
to take care of.

853
00:42:30,084 --> 00:42:32,450
- Mama, these police
been raiding these projects

854
00:42:32,553 --> 00:42:33,542
since I was a kid.

855
00:42:33,654 --> 00:42:37,715
Now they done
started on my kids.

856
00:42:37,825 --> 00:42:40,817
Look at Sherice in there.

857
00:42:40,928 --> 00:42:42,919
It scared her
half to death.

858
00:42:43,030 --> 00:42:44,827
You think it's gonna stop
'cause I plead guilty?

859
00:42:44,932 --> 00:42:45,921
- Excuse me.

860
00:42:46,033 --> 00:42:47,660
Why is that
any of your business?

861
00:42:51,205 --> 00:42:53,070
- After what
they done to me, Mama,

862
00:42:53,174 --> 00:42:55,540
they made it my business.

863
00:42:55,643 --> 00:42:56,803
- Dee!

864
00:42:56,911 --> 00:42:58,208
Dee, wait a minute!
- No, Mama.

865
00:43:06,887 --> 00:43:08,855
I want to help.
- Great.

866
00:43:08,956 --> 00:43:11,584
- May I?

867
00:43:11,692 --> 00:43:13,159
- Please.

868
00:43:15,996 --> 00:43:18,021
- Miss Roberts,
I know Calvin Beckett.

869
00:43:18,132 --> 00:43:20,191
I know him personally.

870
00:43:20,301 --> 00:43:25,000
And filing this suit
against him,

871
00:43:25,106 --> 00:43:28,564
it may make him
change his plans.

872
00:43:28,676 --> 00:43:30,974
But more than likely,

873
00:43:31,078 --> 00:43:34,377
he's gonna come after you
even harder.

874
00:43:34,482 --> 00:43:36,245
He may come after you
very hard.

875
00:43:36,350 --> 00:43:38,648
You need to remember that you
still have criminal charges

876
00:43:38,753 --> 00:43:41,745
pending against you.

877
00:43:41,856 --> 00:43:42,845
- He's right.

878
00:43:45,559 --> 00:43:50,519
- [Mumbling]

879
00:43:50,631 --> 00:43:54,727
He ain't gonna leave me alone
unless I plead guilty.

880
00:43:54,835 --> 00:43:57,030
And I ain't doing that.

881
00:43:57,138 --> 00:44:00,574
So...

882
00:44:00,674 --> 00:44:02,301
what exactly
do you need me to do?

883
00:44:11,819 --> 00:44:15,186
- So why does it seem
such a hard choice, Sam?

884
00:44:15,289 --> 00:44:17,416
- Well, it makes me take sides.

885
00:44:17,525 --> 00:44:20,460
It'll seem kind of like
a political thing, doesn't it?

886
00:44:20,561 --> 00:44:21,926
And I'm not
a political person.

887
00:44:22,029 --> 00:44:23,291
You know that.

888
00:44:23,397 --> 00:44:24,762
And I mean,

889
00:44:24,865 --> 00:44:28,028
well, okay, I'm gonna sue
the district attorney down here.

890
00:44:28,135 --> 00:44:32,003
I mean, the establishment would
be done with me, wouldn't it?

891
00:44:32,106 --> 00:44:35,234
And Leona has been sick.

892
00:44:35,342 --> 00:44:36,570
And we can't afford-

893
00:44:36,677 --> 00:44:40,807
- Then why are you thinking
about doing it at all?

894
00:44:43,751 --> 00:44:46,117
- Hey, did you know that
when I was in high school,

895
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:47,778
I was in West Louisiana,

896
00:44:47,888 --> 00:44:51,688
and used to work
at a town pool out there?

897
00:44:51,792 --> 00:44:55,421
And blacks and whites were just
beginning to swim together.

898
00:44:55,529 --> 00:44:59,260
The idea wasn't very popular
with anybody at that time.

899
00:44:59,366 --> 00:45:02,733
And one afternoon,

900
00:45:02,837 --> 00:45:05,431
I was out there,

901
00:45:05,539 --> 00:45:08,235
and there were
two blacks in the pool,

902
00:45:08,342 --> 00:45:11,038
and there was one black man
in the shower room.

903
00:45:11,145 --> 00:45:13,136
It was in the pool house

904
00:45:13,247 --> 00:45:15,147
where I was mopping down
the floor in there.

905
00:45:15,249 --> 00:45:18,616
And this white man
comes in and he says,

906
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:21,517
"Sam, get out of here."

907
00:45:21,622 --> 00:45:23,180
And I said,
"Well, I work here.

908
00:45:23,290 --> 00:45:24,780
I'm mopping up the floor.
What do you"-

909
00:45:24,892 --> 00:45:26,325
And he said,
"Get the hell out of here."

910
00:45:26,427 --> 00:45:27,416
And I said,
"I can't do that.

911
00:45:27,528 --> 00:45:28,620
I'm not finished
mopping up."

912
00:45:28,729 --> 00:45:30,094
And he pulled out
a tire iron and said,

913
00:45:30,197 --> 00:45:32,688
"Boy, you get your ass
out of here right now."

914
00:45:35,469 --> 00:45:37,699
And I did.

915
00:45:37,805 --> 00:45:39,136
And as I'm running out,

916
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:41,299
all these men
come running in.

917
00:45:41,408 --> 00:45:45,276
They're carrying metal rods,
sticks, pipes.

918
00:45:45,379 --> 00:45:50,009
And as I'm running out,
I heard, you know,

919
00:45:50,117 --> 00:45:52,608
the sound...

920
00:45:56,891 --> 00:46:00,725
And, um...

921
00:46:00,828 --> 00:46:02,819
man died that night.

922
00:46:08,569 --> 00:46:11,094
Couple weeks later,

923
00:46:11,205 --> 00:46:13,400
the FBI
came to my house.

924
00:46:13,507 --> 00:46:15,475
And they wanted to know
what I'd seen.

925
00:46:22,416 --> 00:46:24,316
- What did you tell them?

926
00:46:24,418 --> 00:46:26,943
- I didn't say anything.

927
00:46:31,358 --> 00:46:36,125
I knew
who those men were,

928
00:46:36,230 --> 00:46:38,790
and I didn't say anything.

929
00:46:49,310 --> 00:46:51,505
- Lavosha.

930
00:46:51,612 --> 00:46:53,807
- Hey, Dee, girl.

931
00:46:53,914 --> 00:46:55,882
Baby, how you doing?

932
00:46:55,983 --> 00:46:58,315
It's so good to see you.

933
00:46:58,419 --> 00:46:59,408
- Mm, I'm...

934
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:01,818
[chuckles]

935
00:47:04,091 --> 00:47:05,353
- There.

936
00:47:05,459 --> 00:47:07,324
A whole new you.

937
00:47:07,428 --> 00:47:09,191
- Wow, thank you, Vosha.

938
00:47:09,296 --> 00:47:11,730
I promise,
when I get a new job...

939
00:47:11,832 --> 00:47:13,026
- Mm-mm.

940
00:47:13,133 --> 00:47:15,033
Don't worry about it.
It's on me, honey.

941
00:47:15,135 --> 00:47:16,796
Anytime.

942
00:47:18,539 --> 00:47:19,836
- Thank you so much.

943
00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:22,841
- Aw, sweetie.

944
00:47:22,943 --> 00:47:24,274
- This is good.

945
00:47:24,378 --> 00:47:25,868
- Yeah.

946
00:47:37,057 --> 00:47:39,082
- Okay.

947
00:47:41,128 --> 00:47:42,652
Well, okay.

948
00:47:42,763 --> 00:47:44,628
Well, it's nice to meet you,
Miss Roberts.

949
00:47:44,732 --> 00:47:46,825
Do you think you could
start next Monday?

950
00:47:46,934 --> 00:47:48,196
- Can I start sooner?

951
00:47:48,302 --> 00:47:50,600
- We're just gonna do
a background check first.

952
00:47:50,704 --> 00:47:53,400
You know, arrest record
and all that stuff.

953
00:47:53,507 --> 00:47:57,068
But it shouldn't take long.

954
00:47:57,177 --> 00:47:58,644
- It was nice to meet you.

955
00:47:58,746 --> 00:48:00,077
- Nice to meet you.

956
00:48:12,359 --> 00:48:13,348
- No.

957
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:14,552
- Look...

958
00:48:14,662 --> 00:48:16,095
- No, we're not hiring
at the moment.

959
00:48:16,196 --> 00:48:17,891
No.

960
00:48:17,998 --> 00:48:19,090
- I'm a hard worker.

961
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:21,030
You won't
have to pay me much.

962
00:48:21,135 --> 00:48:22,864
- I'm sorry.

963
00:48:22,970 --> 00:48:26,269
- I'll do dishes,
bus tables, anything.

964
00:48:26,373 --> 00:48:27,601
- No.
- Come on.

965
00:48:27,708 --> 00:48:29,369
- I said no.

Thanks.

1007
00:50:06,774 --> 00:50:08,503
they put them
on a little piece of glass

1008

00:55:36,303 --> 00:55:38,430
You made the paper.

1146
00:55:38,538 --> 00:55:40,938
- Yeah, lucky me.

1147
00:55:41,041 --> 00:55:42,531
- I just spoke
to David Higgins.

1148
00:55:42,642 --> 00:55:43,700
He should be here
any minute.

1149
00:55:43,810 --> 00:55:48,213
Did he listen
to that tape with you?

1150
00:55:48,315 --> 00:55:49,543
- Right there in jail.

1151
00:55:49,649 --> 00:55:51,116
Wasn't nothing
but a lot of crackling

1152
00:55:51,218 --> 00:55:53,345
and some men arguing.

1153
00:55:53,453 --> 00:55:56,422
Not a woman's voice
on the tape.

1154
00:55:56,523 --> 00:55:58,821
- Oh, speak of the devil.

1155
00:55:58,925 --> 00:56:00,825
Hello, David.

1156
00:56:00,927 --> 00:56:02,792
Have a seat.

1157
00:56:02,896 --> 00:56:03,988
I think you know Dee.

1158
00:56:04,097 --> 00:56:06,759
David Cohen,
David Higgins.

1159
00:56:06,867 --> 00:56:09,859
- I'm here
because of George Bush...

1160
00:56:09,970 --> 00:56:12,495
- I just can't find it.

1161
00:56:12,606 --> 00:56:16,007
- Are you telling me
you lost the tape?

1162
00:56:16,109 --> 00:56:18,805
- Well, did you call the DA
about a copy?

1163
00:56:18,912 --> 00:56:21,210
- It seems theirs
is missing too.

1164
00:56:24,217 --> 00:56:26,151
- Okay,
what about the arrest warrant

1165
00:56:26,253 --> 00:56:28,847
that Dee gave you?

1166
00:56:28,955 --> 00:56:31,253
- Well, I'm sure we'll
find it sooner or later.

1167
00:56:31,358 --> 00:56:33,451
- Oh, come on, David.

1168
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:35,926
You can't really expect us
to believe this bullshit.

1169
00:56:36,029 --> 00:56:37,690
- Well, I don't really care what
you believe.

1170
00:56:37,797 --> 00:56:39,765
- Mr. Higgins,
at the very least,

1171
00:56:39,866 --> 00:56:41,299
you're guilty
of gross dereliction

1172
00:56:41,401 --> 00:56:42,800
of your responsibilities.

1173
00:56:42,903 --> 00:56:44,165
And you may
very well be guilty

1174
00:56:44,271 --> 00:56:45,670
of criminal obstruction
of justice.

1175
00:56:45,772 --> 00:56:48,798
- You be very careful
what you say, Mr. Cohen.

1176
00:56:48,909 --> 00:56:50,467
As Sam can tell you,
down here,

1177
00:56:50,577 --> 00:56:51,942
you make enemies for life.

1178
00:56:52,045 --> 00:56:54,673
Miss Roberts, let me
give you some free advice.

1179
00:56:54,781 --> 00:56:56,271
You take the plea.

1180
00:56:56,383 --> 00:56:57,611
You do a little time
on probation,

1181
00:56:57,717 --> 00:56:59,412
and you go back
to your family in peace.

1182
00:56:59,519 --> 00:57:01,248
Be careful
you don't get sent away

1183
00:57:01,354 --> 00:57:02,844
just so some
self-important asshole

1184
00:57:02,956 --> 00:57:05,015
can play civil rights lawyer.

1185
00:57:14,501 --> 00:57:15,968
- Well, that went well.

1186

[Knocking on door]

1187

- I'll get it.

1188
00:57:31,451 --> 00:57:33,942
- Hi.

1189
00:57:34,054 --> 00:57:35,885
Is your mommy here?

1190
00:57:35,989 --> 00:57:37,456
Would you
tell her that Mr. Moss

1191
00:57:37,557 --> 00:57:40,287
from Child
Protective Services is here.

[Camera clicks]

1193
00:57:43,830 --> 00:57:47,459
Miss Roberts, our office has
received a number of complaints

1194
00:57:47,567 --> 00:57:52,834
from the girls' father,
a Mr. Darrell Hughes.

1195
00:57:52,939 --> 00:57:55,806
He claims you're negligent
and abusive.

1196
00:57:55,909 --> 00:57:58,343
- Do you see them,
Mr. Moss?

1197
00:57:58,445 --> 00:58:01,039
Do they look abused?

1198
00:58:01,147 --> 00:58:04,014
- Well, that's what
we're here to evaluate.

1199
00:58:04,117 --> 00:58:06,483
Here is your notice
for a custody hearing

1200
00:58:06,586 --> 00:58:08,281
before the district attorney.

1201
00:58:12,859 --> 00:58:14,087
- Calvin!

1202
00:58:14,194 --> 00:58:16,219
- Calvin, care to comment
on the jury's decision?

1203
00:58:16,329 --> 00:58:17,728
- The jury made a mistake.

1204
00:58:17,831 --> 00:58:19,492
Mr. Green should
never have been acquitted.

1205
00:58:19,599 --> 00:58:21,533
I'm convinced he's guilty,
and he should be in jail.

1206
00:58:21,635 --> 00:58:23,193
- Did the ACLU lawsuit
have anything to do

1207
00:58:23,303 --> 00:58:24,736
with your decision
to drop the charges

1208
00:58:24,838 --> 00:58:26,328
against the other defendants?

1209
00:58:26,439 --> 00:58:28,600
- Look, since the jury
made clear today

1210
00:58:28,708 --> 00:58:31,336
that they do not consider
Mr. Porter a credible witness,

1211
00:58:31,444 --> 00:58:34,140
I'm forced to drop the charges
against everyone we arrested

1212
00:58:34,247 --> 00:58:35,737
in the sweep in Melody.

1213
00:58:35,849 --> 00:58:37,612
Make no mistake,

1214
00:58:37,717 --> 00:58:39,912
I'm certain everyone
was guilty as sin.

1215
00:58:40,020 --> 00:58:41,078
Just can't prove it...

1216
00:58:41,187 --> 00:58:42,245
this time.

1217
00:58:42,355 --> 00:58:45,722
- What about the people
who already pled guilty?

1218
00:58:45,825 --> 00:58:47,019
- What about them?

1219
00:58:47,127 --> 00:58:48,651
They pled guilty.

1220
00:58:48,762 --> 00:58:49,922
They're guilty.

1221
00:58:50,030 --> 00:58:51,657
- Is there gonna be...
- Calvin!

1222

- Dee, that's great news.

1223
00:58:57,437 --> 00:58:58,461
- Mm.

1224
00:58:58,571 --> 00:59:00,539
But he said I'm guilty.

1225
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:02,107
- Doesn't matter
what he said.

1226
00:59:02,208 --> 00:59:03,470
The charges are dropped.

1227
00:59:11,084 --> 00:59:12,449
- What you think, David?

1228
00:59:12,552 --> 00:59:15,715
- Well, it's good news for you.

1229
00:59:15,822 --> 00:59:18,256
And your suit
and the jury's verdict

1230
00:59:18,358 --> 00:59:20,155
have forced Beckett
to change his plans.

1231
00:59:20,260 --> 00:59:23,457
But the system
isn't changing.

1232
00:59:23,563 --> 00:59:25,758
He could raid
Arlington Springs tomorrow

1233
00:59:25,865 --> 00:59:27,799
and start
all over again.

1234
00:59:27,901 --> 00:59:29,493
He's not even
throwing out the convictions

1235
00:59:29,602 --> 00:59:30,933
of people like Gladys,

1236
00:59:31,037 --> 00:59:32,527
who pled guilty
under duress.

1237
00:59:32,639 --> 00:59:33,628
- Excuse me.

1238
00:59:33,740 --> 00:59:36,709
What does this
have to do with Dee?

1239
00:59:36,810 --> 00:59:39,142
- She filed the case
against Beckett.

1240
00:59:39,245 --> 00:59:42,043
If she quits,
the case is over.

1241
00:59:42,148 --> 00:59:44,878
- So you expect her
to keep going?

1242
00:59:47,253 --> 00:59:48,652
What you think?

1243
00:59:51,958 --> 00:59:55,018
- If Dee wants to drop the case,
now's the time to do it.

1244
00:59:59,866 --> 01:00:02,596
But what David's saying is true.

1245
01:00:02,702 --> 01:00:05,000
Beckett's not gonna change.

1246
01:00:05,105 --> 01:00:06,572
The system's
not gonna change.

1247
01:00:06,673 --> 01:00:08,231
- Y'all crazy.

1248
01:00:08,341 --> 01:00:10,172
Dee got a custody hearing
in front of this man.

1249
01:00:10,276 --> 01:00:13,439
- Would y'all please stop
talking about "Dee"

1250
01:00:13,546 --> 01:00:16,640
like I'm not here?

1251
01:00:16,750 --> 01:00:18,342
Just...
I don't know.

but it's your family,

got to be your decision.

and I was real ready
to cooperate.

1305
01:05:10,209 --> 01:05:12,200
- Mr. Porter,
what happened

1306
01:05:12,311 --> 01:05:15,144
after you were taken
to Mr. Beckett's office?

1307
01:05:15,248 --> 01:05:16,476
- He told me about,

1308
01:05:16,582 --> 01:05:22,487
that I know
I could get 60 years and...

1309
01:05:22,588 --> 01:05:27,025
he was real tired
of seeing me.

1310
01:05:27,126 --> 01:05:30,823
So he was gonna watch for my
no-good drug-head ass family.

1311
01:05:30,930 --> 01:05:35,594
- So he threatened you
and your family with jail terms?

1312
01:05:35,702 --> 01:05:37,192
- Yes.

1313
01:05:37,303 --> 01:05:39,567
- Did he threaten you
with bodily harm?

1314
01:05:39,672 --> 01:05:44,075
- He told me
he'd make a phone call

1315
01:05:44,177 --> 01:05:48,341
and get the biggest-dicked
son of a bitch he could find-

1316
01:05:48,448 --> 01:05:51,246
excuse my language, y'all,
but these his exact words:

1317
01:05:51,350 --> 01:05:54,478
"I'm gonna get you locked up,

1318
01:05:54,587 --> 01:05:55,884
"and I'm gonna
make a phone call

1319
01:05:55,988 --> 01:05:57,922
"and get the biggest-dicked
son of a bitch I can find

1320
01:05:58,024 --> 01:06:00,822
to screw you every day for the
rest of your natural born life."

1321
01:06:00,927 --> 01:06:02,224
- Those were his exact words?

1322
01:06:02,328 --> 01:06:04,023
- That was his words to me,
yes.

1323
01:06:04,130 --> 01:06:07,190
- Are you uncomfortable,
Mr. Porter?

1324
01:06:09,202 --> 01:06:10,965
- Well, I said
I didn't want him here.

1325
01:06:11,070 --> 01:06:12,059
- Who are you
referring to?

1326
01:06:12,171 --> 01:06:15,368
- Him.

1327
01:06:15,475 --> 01:06:16,601
- Let the record show

1328
01:06:16,709 --> 01:06:19,906
that Mr. Porter has pointed
at Calvin Beckett.

1329
01:06:20,012 --> 01:06:21,673
- I'm always
gonna be here, Eddie.

1330
01:06:21,781 --> 01:06:23,373
That's my rag.

1331
01:06:23,483 --> 01:06:25,041
I ain't going anywhere.

1332
01:06:30,289 --> 01:06:32,951
- I was given
a list of names.

1333
01:06:33,059 --> 01:06:34,048
- By Beckett?

1334
01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:35,491
- Yeah.

1335
01:06:35,595 --> 01:06:36,721
He had them
right there.

1336
01:06:36,829 --> 01:06:39,229
- Mr. Porter, was Dee Roberts'
name on the list

1337
01:06:39,332 --> 01:06:41,766
the DA gave you?

1338
01:06:41,868 --> 01:06:44,132
- Uh, I don't remember.

1339
01:06:44,237 --> 01:06:45,465
- Oh, come on, Mr. Porter.

1340
01:06:45,571 --> 01:06:49,200
Did you put Dee Roberts'
name down as a drug dealer

1341
01:06:49,308 --> 01:06:52,937
because your cousin Claudia
asked you to?

1342
01:06:53,045 --> 01:06:54,273
- I-I-I can't remember.

1343
01:06:54,380 --> 01:06:56,143
- But you do know
who Claudia is, right?

1344
01:06:56,249 --> 01:06:57,273
You...

1345
01:06:57,383 --> 01:06:59,374
She's-
she lives with Darrell Hughes.

1346
01:06:59,485 --> 01:07:00,952
- I know her.
She my cousin, yeah.

1347
01:07:01,053 --> 01:07:02,543
- Boy, did you put
Dee Roberts' name down

1348
01:07:02,655 --> 01:07:04,418
because your cousin Claudia
asked you to or not?

1349
01:07:04,524 --> 01:07:05,616
- I don't know.

1350
01:07:05,725 --> 01:07:07,283
Look, all they needed
was five more names,

1351
01:07:07,393 --> 01:07:09,258
and they didn't care
who they was.

1352
01:07:12,031 --> 01:07:15,330
- Mr. Porter,
my name is Mark Shelby.

1353
01:07:15,434 --> 01:07:20,133
Mr. Porter, generally, would you
say that you tell the truth?

1354
01:07:20,239 --> 01:07:22,366
- I try to,

1355
01:07:22,475 --> 01:07:24,636
unless I feel
like I'm in danger

1356
01:07:24,744 --> 01:07:27,076
or I got to protect myself.

1357
01:07:27,180 --> 01:07:28,704
- Mm-hmm.

1358
01:07:28,815 --> 01:07:30,043
And were you telling the truth

1359
01:07:30,149 --> 01:07:32,743
when you testified under oath
at the Green trial?

1360
01:07:32,852 --> 01:07:34,877
'Cause the truth
you're telling today

1361
01:07:34,987 --> 01:07:37,979
is not exactly the same truth
you were telling back then.

1362
01:07:38,090 --> 01:07:40,718
- So I'm just trying to figure
out what about today's truth

1363
01:07:40,827 --> 01:07:42,761
is true.

1364
01:07:42,862 --> 01:07:45,660
- Well,
he had me locked up then.

1365
01:07:45,765 --> 01:07:48,859
He could've did anything
he wanted to do to me.

1366
01:07:48,968 --> 01:07:51,198
And now I got to do
what's right,

1367
01:07:51,304 --> 01:07:52,601
'cause the truth
will set you free.

1368
01:07:52,705 --> 01:07:54,070
- Which truth
we talking about,

1369
01:07:54,173 --> 01:07:56,368
the truth you told before
or the truth you're telling now?

1370
01:07:56,475 --> 01:07:59,205
'Cause I'm
a little confused by all that.

1371
01:07:59,312 --> 01:08:00,540
Mr. Porter,

1372
01:08:00,646 --> 01:08:02,307
you ever had
any mental problems?

1373
01:08:04,550 --> 01:08:06,245
- Yeah.

1374
01:08:06,352 --> 01:08:09,253
- Could you tell me
what type?

1375
01:08:09,355 --> 01:08:13,189
- I was diagnosed
with paranoid schizophrenia,

1376
01:08:13,292 --> 01:08:15,522
and I can't remember
the other one.

1377
01:08:15,628 --> 01:08:17,562
- That's all right,
Mr. Porter.

1378
01:08:17,663 --> 01:08:20,188
That's probably enough.

1379
01:08:20,299 --> 01:08:23,063
Now, you understand that we're
embroiled in a lawsuit here.

1380
01:08:23,169 --> 01:08:27,538
And these plaintiffs
are seeking damages.

1381
01:08:27,640 --> 01:08:29,403
And if these
allegations are proven,

1382
01:08:29,508 --> 01:08:32,568
a lot of police officers,
some good men,

1383
01:08:32,678 --> 01:08:34,373
not being
police officers anymore.

1384
01:08:34,480 --> 01:08:38,507
- Is there going to be an end
to this cascade of rhetoric?

1385
01:08:38,618 --> 01:08:43,214
- I'm just trying to determine
if Mr. Porter here

1386
01:08:43,322 --> 01:08:45,187
truly comprehends
the seriousness

1387
01:08:45,291 --> 01:08:46,383
of these allegations,

1388
01:08:46,492 --> 01:08:48,187
allegations
that were brought forth

1389
01:08:48,294 --> 01:08:51,092
by a paranoid schizophrenic

1390
01:08:51,197 --> 01:08:53,028
that can't remember
what else he is.

1391
01:08:53,132 --> 01:08:57,831
- I understand the seriousness
of this whole situation.

1392
01:08:57,937 --> 01:09:02,271
I understand the seriousness
of people being incarcerated.

1393
01:09:02,375 --> 01:09:04,400
I understand the seriousness
of people's lives

1394
01:09:04,510 --> 01:09:08,947
being changed forever
and affected.

1395
01:09:09,048 --> 01:09:10,106
I understand the seriousness

1396
01:09:10,216 --> 01:09:14,016
of not being able
to sleep good at night

1397
01:09:14,120 --> 01:09:17,681
'cause you worried about
somebody coming to your house

1398
01:09:17,790 --> 01:09:23,319
and harming you
or your family members.

1399
01:09:23,429 --> 01:09:25,329
I understand a lot.

1400
01:09:28,167 --> 01:09:30,226
And I know my life
will never be the same.

1401
01:09:48,721 --> 01:09:50,916
- They'll destroy
Porter on the stand.

1402
01:09:51,023 --> 01:09:53,856
- Well, we need to turn his
unreliability back against them.

1403
01:09:53,960 --> 01:09:58,090
- We need a change in venue.

1404
01:09:58,197 --> 01:10:00,631
- The motion is denied.

1405
01:10:00,733 --> 01:10:01,961
- But the district attorney

1406
01:10:02,068 --> 01:10:04,229
has appeared
before you 16 times.

1407
01:10:04,337 --> 01:10:07,670
Surely a change in venue would
result in a fairer trial.

1408
01:10:07,773 --> 01:10:11,470
- The motion
has been denied.

1409
01:10:11,577 --> 01:10:13,169
Is there something
about the word "denied"

1410
01:10:13,279 --> 01:10:15,713
that you don't understand,
Counselor?

1411
01:10:15,815 --> 01:10:17,146
- No, Your Honor.

1412
01:10:17,249 --> 01:10:18,409
- Good.

1413
01:10:24,557 --> 01:10:26,752
- Did you hold a gun
to Eddie Porter's head

1414
01:10:26,859 --> 01:10:28,451
and threaten
to kill him

1415
01:10:28,561 --> 01:10:30,119
if he didn't help you
with your drug cases?

1416
01:10:30,229 --> 01:10:33,528
- No.

1417
01:10:33,632 --> 01:10:35,964
- Did you
give him crack cocaine...

1418
01:10:36,068 --> 01:10:37,092
- No.

1419
01:10:37,203 --> 01:10:38,534
- So he could make
drug buys for you?

1420
01:10:38,637 --> 01:10:39,695
- Absolutely not.

1421
01:10:39,805 --> 01:10:41,170
- Did you suspect
he was using drugs?

1422
01:10:41,273 --> 01:10:42,706
- No.

1423
01:10:42,808 --> 01:10:44,537
- Did you test him?

1424
01:10:44,643 --> 01:10:47,840
- No.

1425
01:10:47,947 --> 01:10:49,608
- You think Eddie Porter
is mentally stable?

1426
01:10:49,715 --> 01:10:50,704
- Objection.

1427
01:10:50,816 --> 01:10:54,308
My client's
not a psychiatrist.

1428
01:10:54,420 --> 01:10:56,388
- You go ahead
and answer the question.

1429
01:10:59,291 --> 01:11:01,623
- I still can't believe
you're doing this.

1430
01:11:01,727 --> 01:11:03,888
- Well, here I am.

1431
01:11:03,996 --> 01:11:06,294
Now please
answer the question.

1432
01:11:10,569 --> 01:11:12,059
- Look,
I can answer any question

1433
01:11:12,171 --> 01:11:13,866
y'all want to throw at me, okay?

1434
01:11:13,973 --> 01:11:15,463
Just 'cause
I didn't go to law school

1435
01:11:15,574 --> 01:11:16,666
doesn't mean shit.

1436
01:11:16,776 --> 01:11:20,974
Eddie Porter is crazier
than a $3 bill, okay?

1437
01:11:21,080 --> 01:11:22,843
He wouldn't know
which way the sky was

1438
01:11:22,948 --> 01:11:24,848
unless I pointed him
up to it.

1439
01:11:24,950 --> 01:11:26,212
The shit that boy did-

1440
01:11:26,318 --> 01:11:28,479
I mean, I had to walk him
through every single step

1441
01:11:28,587 --> 01:11:30,214
every time.

1442
01:11:32,591 --> 01:11:36,391
- Then why'd you trust him
as a confidential informant?

1443
01:11:36,495 --> 01:11:38,963
- Mr. Arnold,
you were a combined

1444
01:11:39,065 --> 01:11:42,432
county drug task force commander
in November of 2000,

1445
01:11:42,535 --> 01:11:43,832
were you not?

1446
01:11:43,936 --> 01:11:45,426
- Yes.

1447
01:11:45,538 --> 01:11:48,063
- Was the drug task force
racist in its design?

1448
01:11:48,174 --> 01:11:50,005
- Absolutely not.

1449
01:11:53,979 --> 01:11:56,379
- I'd like to enter this
as exhibit 5.

1450
01:11:56,482 --> 01:11:58,006
It comes
from your files.

1451
01:11:58,117 --> 01:12:02,781
And it's dated a month before
the raid at Arlington Springs.

1452
01:12:02,888 --> 01:12:07,018
Are those the folks
whom you arrested that day?

1453
01:12:07,126 --> 01:12:08,115
- Most of them.

1454
01:12:08,227 --> 01:12:09,854
- Do you know them?

1455
01:12:11,430 --> 01:12:12,897
- Most of them.

1456
01:12:16,535 --> 01:12:18,503
- Could you tell us
each person's race?

1457
01:12:25,878 --> 01:12:27,402
- Black-

1458
01:12:27,513 --> 01:12:30,448
African American.

1459
01:12:30,549 --> 01:12:32,949
Black,
don't know,

1460
01:12:33,052 --> 01:12:35,646
black, black,
black, black.

1461
01:12:35,754 --> 01:12:37,779
I believe black.

1462
01:12:37,890 --> 01:12:40,381
Black, don't know,

1463
01:12:40,493 --> 01:12:42,222
gonna assume black,

1464
01:12:42,328 --> 01:12:43,317
black, black,

1465
01:12:43,429 --> 01:12:44,919
assume black again,

1466
01:12:45,030 --> 01:12:48,261
black, black,
black, black,

1467
01:12:48,367 --> 01:12:51,461
black, black, black,
don't know,

1468
01:12:51,570 --> 01:12:53,128
black.

1469
01:13:03,782 --> 01:13:05,511
- Mr. Lloyd,
I warned you last time.

1470
01:13:05,618 --> 01:13:06,778
- What?

1471
01:13:06,886 --> 01:13:09,411
He ain't fit
to take the kids.

1472
01:13:09,522 --> 01:13:11,251
All right, the first chance
he has to go to a bar,

1473
01:13:11,357 --> 01:13:12,824
he'll leave
their ass hungry.

1474
01:13:12,925 --> 01:13:15,189
- True, but I'm not gonna leave
the children with you either.

1475
01:13:15,294 --> 01:13:16,693
They're gonna have to go
to a group home.

1476
01:13:16,795 --> 01:13:17,784
- Look, I got a house.

1477
01:13:17,897 --> 01:13:18,886
They belong
with their mama.

1478
01:13:18,998 --> 01:13:19,987
- Miss Lloyd?
- What?

1479
01:13:20,099 --> 01:13:21,088
- This is not a debate society.

1480
01:13:21,200 --> 01:13:22,189
You're done here.

1481
01:13:22,301 --> 01:13:23,666
- Those are my kids.

1482
01:13:23,769 --> 01:13:25,066
They belong
with their mama.

1483
01:13:25,171 --> 01:13:26,934
- Thank you very much.

1484
01:13:28,240 --> 01:13:30,265
- Next case.
- Here you are, sir.

1485
01:13:32,344 --> 01:13:34,471
- Hughes versus Roberts.

1486
01:13:36,415 --> 01:13:37,712
- Dee.

1487
01:13:42,821 --> 01:13:44,254
- She's violent.

1488
01:13:44,356 --> 01:13:45,345
She's abusive.

1489
01:13:45,457 --> 01:13:47,391
Just last month,

1490
01:13:47,493 --> 01:13:49,654
she was arrested
for a criminal attack.

1491
01:13:49,762 --> 01:13:51,457
- The attack
was on his truck

1492
01:13:51,564 --> 01:13:53,156
because he kidnapped my girls.

1493
01:13:53,265 --> 01:13:55,790
- Well, they my children too.

1494
01:13:55,901 --> 01:13:57,892
- I've never
abandoned my daughters.

1495
01:13:58,003 --> 01:14:00,403
I was in jail, and I left them
with their grandmother,

1496
01:14:00,506 --> 01:14:02,474
my mother,
who's an excellent caregiver.

1497
01:14:02,575 --> 01:14:04,975
- Well, Miss Roberts,
you do seem to have

1498
01:14:05,077 --> 01:14:08,478
a rich and varied
relationship with the law.

1499
01:14:08,581 --> 01:14:10,606
Larceny, criminal attack,

1500
01:14:10,716 --> 01:14:12,240
repeated disturbances
of the peace.

1501
01:14:12,351 --> 01:14:14,376
- You mean where I'm screaming
'cause he's beating me?

1502
01:14:14,486 --> 01:14:17,182
- An arrest for selling drugs
in a school zone.

1503
01:14:19,391 --> 01:14:20,949
- Those charges
have been dropped.

1504
01:14:21,060 --> 01:14:22,687
- Mm.

1505
01:14:22,795 --> 01:14:25,320
One can see
why Mr. Hughes is concerned.

1506
01:14:25,431 --> 01:14:26,762
- If he is so concerned,

1507
01:14:26,865 --> 01:14:28,958
maybe he should make some
of his child support payments.

1508
01:14:29,068 --> 01:14:30,296
- I do pay child-

1509
01:14:30,402 --> 01:14:32,131
it's called "child support"
not "Dee support."

1510
01:14:32,238 --> 01:14:33,227
I pay for my children.

1511
01:14:33,339 --> 01:14:34,897
- Or stop seeing a woman

1512
01:14:35,007 --> 01:14:36,702
who's been convicted
for child molesting.

1513
01:14:36,809 --> 01:14:39,004
- All right, now,
you know that's not true.

1514
01:14:39,111 --> 01:14:41,841
Mr. Hughes, if I want
any more input from you,

1515
01:14:41,947 --> 01:14:43,278
I will ask for it.

1516
01:14:47,653 --> 01:14:49,348
You seem to have a point,
Miss Roberts.

1517
01:14:49,455 --> 01:14:52,788
Perhaps these girls shouldn't be
with Mr. Hughes either.

1518
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:57,485
Unfit parents are why the state
has homes for children,

1519
01:14:57,596 --> 01:15:00,156
after all.

1520
01:15:00,266 --> 01:15:03,793
- I am not
an unfit mother.

1521
01:15:03,902 --> 01:15:07,633
Now, if you want to hurt me
because I'm suing you,

1522
01:15:07,740 --> 01:15:10,868
go ahead and do it.

1523
01:15:10,976 --> 01:15:14,343
But so help me God,
if you hurt my children...

1524
01:15:23,389 --> 01:15:25,983
I'm not an unfit mother.

1525
01:15:29,962 --> 01:15:32,089
- [Sighs]

1526
01:15:35,034 --> 01:15:39,198
- I have a report here
from CPS Inspector Moss.

1527
01:15:39,305 --> 01:15:41,899
Hm.

1528
01:15:42,007 --> 01:15:45,738
Based on that, I am leaving
the children with you for now.

1529
01:15:45,844 --> 01:15:47,539
But, Miss Roberts,

1530
01:15:47,646 --> 01:15:53,278
do not assume that I will be
so lenient next time.

1531
01:15:53,385 --> 01:15:55,080
Next case.

1532
01:16:14,273 --> 01:16:16,537
- Do you think
it will help?

1533
01:16:16,642 --> 01:16:17,631
- Help?

1534
01:16:17,743 --> 01:16:19,301
- The lawsuit.

1535
01:16:19,411 --> 01:16:21,208
Will it really help?

1536
01:16:21,313 --> 01:16:23,110
- Will it-
Dee?

1537
01:16:23,215 --> 01:16:25,410
An African-American man
has a better chance

1538
01:16:25,517 --> 01:16:28,975
of being charged for a crime
than graduating college.

1539
01:16:29,088 --> 01:16:36,654
The system
is so fundamentally broken...

1540
01:16:36,762 --> 01:16:40,198
Oh, God,
I don't know.

1541
01:16:40,299 --> 01:16:41,926
Yes.

1542
01:16:42,034 --> 01:16:44,867
I think it'll help.

1543
01:16:44,970 --> 01:16:46,335
I hope it'll help.

1544
01:16:49,875 --> 01:16:52,343
Are you ready for tomorrow?

1545
01:16:52,444 --> 01:16:56,107
- I'll be fine.

1546
01:16:56,215 --> 01:16:58,046
Thank you.

1547
01:16:58,150 --> 01:16:59,139
- I should be thanking you.

1548
01:16:59,251 --> 01:17:00,775
I don't...

1549
01:17:00,886 --> 01:17:04,982
I don't know how you have
the strength to keep going.

1550
01:17:05,090 --> 01:17:06,352
- I had help.

1551
01:17:11,830 --> 01:17:13,491
- All right.

1552
01:17:13,599 --> 01:17:14,930
Shall we?

1553
01:17:18,036 --> 01:17:20,004
- Miss Roberts,
do you have a job?

1554
01:17:20,105 --> 01:17:21,163
- No.

1555
01:17:21,273 --> 01:17:24,003
- Are you currently
seeking employment?

1556
01:17:24,109 --> 01:17:25,235
- Yes.

1557
01:17:25,344 --> 01:17:28,336
But it's hard
because of the drug thing.

1558
01:17:28,447 --> 01:17:31,314
- So you have
no source of income?

1559
01:17:32,785 --> 01:17:34,275
- But my mama's
helping me out.

1560
01:17:34,386 --> 01:17:37,822
- Sounds to me like
you could use some money.

1561
01:17:37,923 --> 01:17:39,914
I bet a big, old, fat settlement
check from my clients

1562
01:17:40,025 --> 01:17:41,117
would come in handy,
wouldn't it?

1563
01:17:41,226 --> 01:17:42,215
What do you think, Gus?

1564
01:17:42,327 --> 01:17:43,316
- Objection.

1565
01:17:43,429 --> 01:17:44,418
Is that a question?

1566
01:17:44,530 --> 01:17:45,656
- [Chuckles]

1567
01:17:45,764 --> 01:17:47,698
I knew that was coming.

1568
01:17:47,800 --> 01:17:50,530
Speaking of that drug thing,

1569
01:17:50,636 --> 01:17:53,036
you'd been arrested before,
hadn't you,

1570
01:17:53,138 --> 01:17:55,299
and since.

1571
01:17:55,407 --> 01:17:56,567
- Yes.

1572
01:17:56,675 --> 01:17:59,974
- Now, it seems to me that
the more you do something,

1573
01:18:00,078 --> 01:18:02,945
the more used to it
you get,

1574
01:18:03,048 --> 01:18:04,845
the less stressful
it should become.

1575
01:18:04,950 --> 01:18:06,781
- Oh, come on, Mark.
What are you do-

1576
01:18:06,885 --> 01:18:08,352
are you asking a question,

1577
01:18:08,454 --> 01:18:10,547
or is this a monologue?

1578
01:18:10,656 --> 01:18:12,487
- Just an observation, Sam.

1579
01:18:12,591 --> 01:18:14,752
Tell me about
your first arrest.

1580
01:18:14,860 --> 01:18:16,555
- It was for theft.

1581
01:18:16,662 --> 01:18:17,720
It was a very long time ago.

1582
01:18:17,830 --> 01:18:19,798
- You were guilty?

1583
01:18:19,898 --> 01:18:22,662
- Well, yes, but-
- You were guilty.

1584
01:18:22,768 --> 01:18:23,996
So your second arrest,

1585
01:18:24,102 --> 01:18:26,832
that was for selling drugs
in a school zone.

1586
01:18:26,939 --> 01:18:28,133
We know all about that,
don't we?

1587
01:18:28,240 --> 01:18:29,434
- Those charges
were dropped.

1588
01:18:29,541 --> 01:18:31,975
- What about
this most recent arrest?

1589
01:18:32,077 --> 01:18:34,773
Tell me about that.

1590
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:37,371
- It was for criminal mischief.

1591
01:18:37,483 --> 01:18:39,917
I busted up Darrell's truck

1592
01:18:40,018 --> 01:18:42,009
so he would give me
my girls back.

1593
01:18:42,120 --> 01:18:43,815
- You were guilty
of that one too?

1594
01:18:43,922 --> 01:18:45,048
- Those charges
were dropped.

1595
01:18:45,157 --> 01:18:46,954
- But you were guilty.
- Objection.

1596
01:18:47,059 --> 01:18:49,323
Mr. Shelby,
this is not a court of law,

1597
01:18:49,428 --> 01:18:51,089
and you're not a judge.

1598
01:18:51,196 --> 01:18:53,061
- Uh, who's this guy Darrell?

1599
01:18:53,165 --> 01:18:54,462
- Darrell Hughes,
he's the father

1600
01:18:54,566 --> 01:18:55,931
of my two youngest kids.

1601
01:18:56,034 --> 01:18:57,626
- But I thought
you had four children.

1602
01:18:57,736 --> 01:19:00,466
- I do have four children.

1603
01:19:00,572 --> 01:19:02,267
- The oldest two
have different fathers.

1604
01:19:02,374 --> 01:19:03,932
- Fathers,
like plural?

1605
01:19:05,377 --> 01:19:07,436
- [Laughs]
Damn, woman.

1606
01:19:07,546 --> 01:19:09,138
How many different men
have you had sex with

1607
01:19:09,248 --> 01:19:10,306
in the past eight years, huh?

1608
01:19:10,415 --> 01:19:11,404
- Objection!

1609
01:19:17,289 --> 01:19:18,984
- You okay?

1610
01:19:19,091 --> 01:19:20,991
- Uh-huh.

1611
01:19:21,093 --> 01:19:22,890
Seen better days.

1612
01:19:22,995 --> 01:19:25,896
- Well, you're doing good.

1613
01:19:25,998 --> 01:19:29,593
Remember, they're just as afraid
of you as you are of them.

1614
01:19:29,701 --> 01:19:31,896
- [Sighs]

1615
01:19:38,343 --> 01:19:41,710
- All right, let's get back
to these multiple fathers

1616
01:19:41,813 --> 01:19:43,280
we were talking about
before the break.

1617
01:19:43,382 --> 01:19:44,974
Now, we know about
Darrell Hughes,

1618
01:19:45,083 --> 01:19:48,280
but what can you tell me
about the other two?

1619
01:19:48,387 --> 01:19:50,651
Where do they
currently reside?

1620
01:19:50,756 --> 01:19:51,780
- They in prison.

1621
01:19:51,890 --> 01:19:53,221
- Both of them?

1622
01:19:55,260 --> 01:19:56,693
- Mm-hmm.

1623
01:19:56,795 --> 01:19:59,559
- Why?
What were they convicted of?

1624
01:19:59,665 --> 01:20:02,634
- You know,
I believe drugs.

1625
01:20:02,734 --> 01:20:03,962
- Drugs.

1626
01:20:04,069 --> 01:20:05,161
What kind of drugs?

1627
01:20:06,305 --> 01:20:07,294
- Cocaine.

1628
01:20:07,406 --> 01:20:08,930
- Cocaine.
Crack cocaine?

1629
01:20:10,142 --> 01:20:12,906
Would you mind
repeating that for the record?

1630
01:20:15,047 --> 01:20:16,446
- Crack cocaine.

1631
01:20:16,548 --> 01:20:19,039
- That's the same drug that you
were arrested for dealing,

1632
01:20:19,151 --> 01:20:20,914
was it not?

1633
01:20:21,019 --> 01:20:22,008
- Well, I didn't do that.

1634
01:20:22,120 --> 01:20:24,179
- Yeah, so you say.
- Objection!

1635
01:20:24,289 --> 01:20:27,918
Miss Roberts
is not on trial here.

1636
01:20:28,026 --> 01:20:29,288
- Well, Counselor,
forgive me,

1637
01:20:29,394 --> 01:20:31,589
but I'm just having a tough time
trying to understand

1638
01:20:31,697 --> 01:20:34,860
why it is that this arrest
has caused Miss Roberts

1639
01:20:34,967 --> 01:20:37,561
so much mental duress.

1640
01:20:37,669 --> 01:20:40,137
I mean, it seems to me
like she and her whole family

1641
01:20:40,238 --> 01:20:43,173
have been in
and out of jails and prisons

1642
01:20:43,275 --> 01:20:47,405
and police stations
her whole life long.

1643
01:20:47,512 --> 01:20:49,480
So what is it
about this particular arrest

1644
01:20:49,581 --> 01:20:51,105
that is so different?

1645
01:20:51,216 --> 01:20:52,547
- Mr. Shelby-

1646
01:20:52,651 --> 01:20:54,585
- I'll tell you what
made this arrest so different.

1647
01:20:54,686 --> 01:20:56,381
I've only spent
one night in jail before this.

1648
01:20:56,488 --> 01:20:57,750
I was 16 years old,

1649
01:20:57,856 --> 01:21:00,848
was arrested for stealing
diapers and milk for my babies.

1650
01:21:00,959 --> 01:21:03,223
I did it.
They kept me for one night.

1651
01:21:03,328 --> 01:21:04,795
I knew
I was getting right out.

1652
01:21:04,896 --> 01:21:08,764
To be locked up
for 21 days

1653
01:21:08,867 --> 01:21:10,391
away from my girls

1654
01:21:10,502 --> 01:21:13,767
not knowing if I was gonna
get out to see them again,

1655
01:21:13,872 --> 01:21:17,364
21 days in a cage...

1656
01:21:17,476 --> 01:21:19,205
I may not
have all your schooling,

1657
01:21:19,311 --> 01:21:21,472
but it seems
pretty different to me.

1658
01:21:28,186 --> 01:21:30,017
- Judge Belmont
has decided

1659
01:21:30,122 --> 01:21:33,819
that Beckett only has to answer
our questions for three hours.

1660
01:21:33,925 --> 01:21:37,827
Any more time would be
wasting the DA's time.

1661
01:21:37,929 --> 01:21:41,023
- We knew he was gonna
give him a lot of room.

1662
01:21:41,133 --> 01:21:44,330
- Dee, it is atrocious after
what they've put you through.

1663
01:21:49,941 --> 01:21:51,465
- Mr. Hill,

1664
01:21:51,576 --> 01:21:55,808
if you were Beckett's lawyer,
what would you do?

1665
01:21:55,914 --> 01:21:58,280
- Uh...

1666
01:21:58,383 --> 01:22:02,376
I'd destroy Porter's credibility
right from the start.

1667
01:22:02,487 --> 01:22:03,476
I mean, he's nuts.

1668
01:22:03,588 --> 01:22:05,317
Nothing he says
can be believed,

1669
01:22:05,424 --> 01:22:07,255
and he's our
only source of information

1670
01:22:07,359 --> 01:22:10,021
as to what really went on.

1671
01:22:10,128 --> 01:22:12,460
I'd argue that having the police
rely on him as an informant

1672
01:22:12,564 --> 01:22:15,089
was a mistake
but an honest one.

1673
01:22:15,200 --> 01:22:17,225
- All right,
what about the numbers?

1674
01:22:17,335 --> 01:22:19,064
All white cops,
all black targets.

1675
01:22:19,171 --> 01:22:20,502
- Coincidence.

1676
01:22:20,605 --> 01:22:23,506
It's a result of the drug
they chose to go after,

1677
01:22:23,608 --> 01:22:25,303
crack cocaine.

1678
01:22:25,410 --> 01:22:28,277
Feds target it.
Why can't the task force?

1679
01:22:29,347 --> 01:22:33,113
And, Dee,
I'd go after you.

1680
01:22:33,218 --> 01:22:36,517
I mean,
really work on you,

1681
01:22:36,621 --> 01:22:39,181
suggest that you're
just a desperate crack mother

1682
01:22:39,291 --> 01:22:42,522
trying to score
a monetary judgment

1683
01:22:42,627 --> 01:22:43,821
by playing the race card

1684
01:22:43,929 --> 01:22:47,456
against a hardworking group
of public servants.

1685
01:22:47,566 --> 01:22:49,295
The police
made some mistakes.

1686
01:22:49,401 --> 01:22:50,663
They have a tough job.

1687
01:22:50,769 --> 01:22:52,236
Occasionally,
they'll make mistakes.

1688
01:22:52,337 --> 01:22:54,066
They're only human.

1689
01:22:54,172 --> 01:22:57,608
Should we really punish them
for trying to protect us?

1690
01:22:58,944 --> 01:23:01,742
- Well, there you have it.

1691
01:23:01,847 --> 01:23:04,042
It'll work too.

1692
01:23:04,149 --> 01:23:05,980
We'll never
get anywhere with Belmont

1693
01:23:06,084 --> 01:23:08,518
by criticizing the cops.

1694
01:23:08,620 --> 01:23:12,454
We have to prove that Beckett
was motivated by racist intent.

1695
01:23:19,231 --> 01:23:22,962
- How can you prove
racist intent?

1696
01:23:27,139 --> 01:23:29,164
- You look
at a person's history.

1697
01:23:29,274 --> 01:23:31,242
You interview his coworkers,
his family,

1698
01:23:31,343 --> 01:23:32,935
people who know him well.

1699
01:23:33,044 --> 01:23:35,171
But we've tried everyone.

1700
01:23:35,280 --> 01:23:37,874
No one is gonna
say anything about Beckett.

1701
01:23:42,053 --> 01:23:43,680
- There's Julie's car.

1702
01:23:46,625 --> 01:23:49,185
She's a regular
at the coffee shop.

1703
01:24:04,843 --> 01:24:06,276
Thank you, Julie.

1704
01:24:06,378 --> 01:24:08,869
- It's about time
somebody said something.

1705
01:24:12,384 --> 01:24:15,046
- Just a second now.

1706
01:24:18,356 --> 01:24:19,345
- Okay?

1707
01:24:19,457 --> 01:24:20,981
- We're good.

1708
01:24:21,092 --> 01:24:25,961
- Are you ready,
Mrs. Beckett?

1709
01:24:26,064 --> 01:24:28,055
- Yes.

1710
01:24:28,166 --> 01:24:29,258
- All right,

1711
01:24:29,367 --> 01:24:31,028
now, this one's gonna be
a little bit harder.

1712
01:24:31,136 --> 01:24:33,229
- Used fractions...

1713
01:24:33,338 --> 01:24:36,205
[pounding on door]

1714
01:24:36,308 --> 01:24:38,401
- Come on, it's me!

1715
01:24:38,510 --> 01:24:39,499
Open up the door, Dee.

1716
01:24:39,611 --> 01:24:40,600
I know you in there.
Come on.

1717
01:24:40,712 --> 01:24:41,906
[Pounding on door]

1718
01:24:42,013 --> 01:24:43,503
- Darrell, go home.

1719
01:24:43,615 --> 01:24:44,604
- Dee, open the door.

1720
01:24:44,716 --> 01:24:45,808
Come on.

1721
01:24:45,917 --> 01:24:47,942
[Pounding on door]

1722
01:24:48,053 --> 01:24:49,953
- Stop knocking on my door,
come on.

1723
01:24:50,055 --> 01:24:52,216
Stay there, Sherice.

1724
01:24:52,324 --> 01:24:53,313
- Hey.

1725
01:24:53,425 --> 01:24:55,916
- You drunk.

1726
01:24:56,027 --> 01:24:57,995
- I came
to get the girls.

1727
01:24:58,096 --> 01:24:59,120
They need
their father too.

1728
01:24:59,231 --> 01:25:00,562
- Look, you heard
what the man said.

1729
01:25:00,665 --> 01:25:01,859
They need
to be with their mother.

1730
01:25:01,967 --> 01:25:03,958
Mm-mm. Go home.
Good night.

1731
01:25:04,069 --> 01:25:06,162
- Come on now,
listen to me.

1732
01:25:06,271 --> 01:25:08,466
Look, think about it.
Hear me out.

1733
01:25:08,573 --> 01:25:09,938
If we got back together,

1734
01:25:10,041 --> 01:25:13,408
then they could have us both.

1735
01:25:13,511 --> 01:25:15,240
- Mm-mm.

1736
01:25:15,347 --> 01:25:17,406
No, we been through this
already, Darrell.

1737
01:25:17,515 --> 01:25:18,504
No.
- It won't be like that.

1738
01:25:18,617 --> 01:25:19,879
- Darrell, go home.

1739
01:25:19,985 --> 01:25:22,044
Darrell!
- Come on!

1740
01:25:22,153 --> 01:25:23,381
Don't come into my-

1741
01:25:23,488 --> 01:25:24,978
Go to your room, Sherice!

1742
01:25:25,090 --> 01:25:26,921
Get to your room right now.

1743
01:25:27,025 --> 01:25:29,118
- Give me
two seconds to talk!

1744
01:25:31,663 --> 01:25:33,631
Give me my girls!

1745
01:25:33,732 --> 01:25:34,858
- 2-4-
- Go ahead, call 'em.

1746
01:25:34,966 --> 01:25:37,400
I don't care.

1747
01:25:37,502 --> 01:25:38,992
Come on, man,
we're getting out of here.

1748
01:25:39,104 --> 01:25:40,628
- Please come
as soon as you can.

1749
01:25:40,739 --> 01:25:41,831
It's an emergency.

1750
01:25:41,940 --> 01:25:43,168
Darrell, please!

1751
01:25:43,275 --> 01:25:44,606
- Let's go.
- Don't do this, Darrell.

1752
01:25:44,709 --> 01:25:45,698
- Come on,
get out my way!

1753
01:25:45,810 --> 01:25:47,607
- I'm not-
- Get off me!

1754
01:25:47,712 --> 01:25:49,407
- Stop it!
Get out my house!

1755
01:25:49,514 --> 01:25:51,311
- Hey, have you lost
your Goddamned mind?

1756
01:25:51,416 --> 01:25:52,781
- Mama!
- Put that baby down!

1757
01:25:52,884 --> 01:25:53,942
- What you gonna
do with that?

1758
01:25:54,052 --> 01:25:55,041
- I will knock you out.

1759
01:25:55,153 --> 01:25:56,484
- Well, hell,
old lady, swing!

1760
01:25:56,588 --> 01:25:57,577
- Come on,
step into it.

1761
01:25:57,689 --> 01:25:58,678
- What you gonna
do with that, huh?

1762
01:25:58,790 --> 01:25:59,779
- I'm gonna
knock your head off!

1763
01:25:59,891 --> 01:26:00,983
- Go ahead, go ahead!

1764
01:26:01,092 --> 01:26:02,423
- Your girls
are looking at you, Darrell.

1765
01:26:02,527 --> 01:26:04,461
- I wish you would.
- Go ahead, swing!

1766
01:26:04,562 --> 01:26:05,859
- I'll knock you out,
Darrell!

1767
01:26:05,964 --> 01:26:07,090
- Get off me!

1768
01:26:07,198 --> 01:26:09,257
- You know Beckett
ain't gonna charge me!

1769
01:26:09,367 --> 01:26:11,858
You know Beckett
ain't gonna charge me!

1770
01:26:11,970 --> 01:26:14,996
You know Beckett
ain't gonna charge me, Dee.

1771
01:26:15,106 --> 01:26:16,130
I'll be back!

1772
01:26:16,241 --> 01:26:17,230
- Come on.

1773
01:26:31,923 --> 01:26:33,584
- I know.

1774
01:26:33,692 --> 01:26:35,956
I know, sweetie.

1775
01:26:36,061 --> 01:26:39,758
I'm here with you.

1776
01:26:39,864 --> 01:26:41,559
I'm here with you.

1777
01:26:49,841 --> 01:26:51,331
- Hey.

1778
01:26:56,181 --> 01:26:57,876
- I'm here with you.

1779
01:27:03,121 --> 01:27:04,850
- Come on, Dee.

1780
01:27:08,860 --> 01:27:12,387
All right,
here we go.

1781
01:27:12,497 --> 01:27:15,125
- So sorry I'm late.

1782
01:27:15,233 --> 01:27:16,359
Had a rough night.

1783
01:27:16,468 --> 01:27:19,198
- It's all right.
Sam's already there.

1784
01:27:19,304 --> 01:27:20,931
- You okay, Dee?

1785
01:27:21,039 --> 01:27:23,405
- I'm fine.

1786
01:27:23,508 --> 01:27:25,533
David,

1787
01:27:25,643 --> 01:27:27,440
I have an idea.

1788
01:27:27,545 --> 01:27:29,342
[Engine turns]

1789
01:27:33,385 --> 01:27:35,580
- Three hours, Sam.

1790
01:27:35,687 --> 01:27:37,678
The judge said
you get three hours with me.

1791
01:27:37,789 --> 01:27:39,256
Nine minutes is over.

1792
01:27:39,357 --> 01:27:40,824
- [Mumbles]

1793
01:27:42,827 --> 01:27:45,921
- Sam, there's no need
to be uncivil, is there?

1794
01:27:46,031 --> 01:27:48,124
After all,
we used to be friends.

1795
01:27:48,233 --> 01:27:52,636
We still have to be together
for 2 hours and 50 minutes.

1796
01:27:56,207 --> 01:27:57,196
- Sorry we're late.

1797
01:28:03,815 --> 01:28:07,945
Mr. Beckett, you're aware
that the videotape we're taping

1798
01:28:08,053 --> 01:28:09,577
will become part
of the public record?

1799
01:28:14,893 --> 01:28:16,827
I'm gonna
take your silence as assent.

1800
01:28:16,928 --> 01:28:19,863
Before we begin,
Mr. Beckett,

1801
01:28:19,964 --> 01:28:22,023
I'd like
to introduce my associate,

1802
01:28:22,133 --> 01:28:24,897
Mr. Byron Hill.

1803
01:28:25,003 --> 01:28:30,600
Mr. Hill will be
conducting your deposition.

1804
01:28:39,484 --> 01:28:41,145
- Good morning.

1805
01:28:41,252 --> 01:28:44,949
Mr. Beckett,
is it your regular practice

1806
01:28:45,056 --> 01:28:47,752
to indict someone based on
the word of a single informant?

1807
01:28:47,859 --> 01:28:50,259
- Regular practice
all across Texas.

1808
01:28:50,361 --> 01:28:52,591
- And is it also your practice
to give the informant

1809
01:28:52,697 --> 01:28:54,597
a list of people
you want to find guilty?

1810
01:28:54,699 --> 01:28:56,030
- Objection.

1811
01:28:56,134 --> 01:28:58,068
Question assumes my client
gave such a list.

1812
01:28:58,169 --> 01:29:00,433
- Mr. Beckett, do you frequently
use informants

1813
01:29:00,538 --> 01:29:03,905
with a history of...

1814
01:29:04,008 --> 01:29:05,168
mental instability?

1815
01:29:05,276 --> 01:29:09,076
- We use informants
that know the drug dealers.

1816
01:29:09,180 --> 01:29:11,512
This list rarely
includes Baptist preachers,

1817
01:29:11,616 --> 01:29:12,878
Jewish rabbis,

1818
01:29:12,984 --> 01:29:15,612
or wise-ass lawyers.

1819
01:29:22,393 --> 01:29:24,759
- Please mark this
as exhibit 5.

1820
01:29:30,902 --> 01:29:33,029
- Mr. Beckett, these are
your drug arrest records

1821
01:29:33,138 --> 01:29:34,765
for the past five years.

1822
01:29:34,873 --> 01:29:38,331
Now, Harmony County
is less than half black.

1823
01:29:38,443 --> 01:29:41,879
Why do you think over 85%
of the task force arrests

1824
01:29:41,980 --> 01:29:43,538
are of black people?

1825
01:29:43,648 --> 01:29:45,639
- Must be that it's them
doing all the drugs.

1826
01:29:48,620 --> 01:29:51,350
40 minutes left, boy.

1827
01:29:57,662 --> 01:29:59,994
- Mr. Beckett,

1828
01:30:00,098 --> 01:30:04,296
even black people
can tell time.

1829
01:30:04,402 --> 01:30:06,768
Calvin...

1830
01:30:06,871 --> 01:30:10,500
You don't mind
if I call you that, do you?

1831
01:30:10,608 --> 01:30:12,633
You seem to have a problem
with us black people.

1832
01:30:12,744 --> 01:30:13,836
- Objection.

1833
01:30:13,945 --> 01:30:15,412
- To what?
That wasn't even a question.

1834
01:30:15,513 --> 01:30:17,413
- You ever call
blacks "niggers"?

1835
01:30:21,553 --> 01:30:22,577
Answer the question.

1836
01:30:25,456 --> 01:30:26,684
Answer the question.

1837
01:30:28,893 --> 01:30:31,123
Mr. Beckett,
you are under oath,

1838
01:30:31,229 --> 01:30:33,424
and you have
an obligation to respond.

1839
01:30:33,531 --> 01:30:34,623
- I don't remember.

1840
01:30:35,833 --> 01:30:38,131
- You never said it?

1841
01:30:38,236 --> 01:30:40,204
- I don't remember
ever saying it.

1842
01:30:43,808 --> 01:30:46,504
- What's your relationship like
with your ex-wife?

1843
01:30:46,611 --> 01:30:48,306
- Don't have
any kind of relationship.

1844
01:30:48,413 --> 01:30:50,711
What the hell
kind of a question is that?

1845
01:30:50,815 --> 01:30:52,942
- She seems to have a better
memory than you do, Calvin.

1846
01:30:56,454 --> 01:30:59,617
- My name
is Elizabeth Beckett.

1847
01:30:59,724 --> 01:31:03,353
And I'm competent
to testify therein.

1848
01:31:03,461 --> 01:31:09,331
- How'd your ex-husband feel
about black people?

1849
01:31:09,434 --> 01:31:10,731
- Oh, he hated them.

1850
01:31:10,835 --> 01:31:13,235
Calvin hated them.

1851
01:31:13,338 --> 01:31:14,396
He even hated the children.

1852
01:31:14,505 --> 01:31:15,938
If they came in our yard,

1853
01:31:16,040 --> 01:31:18,372
he'd go out there
and scream at them.

1854
01:31:18,476 --> 01:31:22,936
- You think his views
affect his behavior as a DA?

1855
01:31:23,047 --> 01:31:25,880
- He thought
that people wanted convictions.

1856
01:31:25,984 --> 01:31:30,387
He thought that
the feds wanted convictions.

1857
01:31:30,488 --> 01:31:33,946
Calvin would say that,

1858
01:31:34,058 --> 01:31:39,860
"Who better to convict
than the lazy-ass niggers?"

1859
01:31:43,501 --> 01:31:47,335
- He referred
to black people as "niggers"?

1860
01:31:47,438 --> 01:31:50,669
- Yes.

1861
01:31:50,775 --> 01:31:52,538
Yes, he did.

1862
01:31:52,644 --> 01:31:53,838
Yes.

1863
01:31:53,945 --> 01:31:58,678
- Now, uh,
you remember her, right?

1864
01:31:58,783 --> 01:31:59,841
Ex-wife?

1865
01:31:59,951 --> 01:32:02,681
That's your ex-wife.

1866
01:32:02,787 --> 01:32:04,448
You want to see
what your daughter has to say,

1867
01:32:04,555 --> 01:32:07,285
or has your memory returned?

1868
01:32:07,392 --> 01:32:09,724
Let's see what
your daughter has to say.

1869
01:32:09,827 --> 01:32:11,055
- My name is Julie Beckett.

1870
01:32:11,162 --> 01:32:15,189
I'm 22, and I'm competent
to testify herein.

1871
01:32:15,300 --> 01:32:17,700
- Right, okay, Julie,

1872
01:32:17,802 --> 01:32:22,068
did your father ever express any
hostility toward black people?

1873
01:32:22,173 --> 01:32:24,801
- Oh, yeah, never even
tried to hide it, you know?

1874
01:32:24,909 --> 01:32:26,206
Him and Jerry Arnold,

1875
01:32:26,311 --> 01:32:29,007
they would, like, sit around
and drink beers and shit.

1876
01:32:29,113 --> 01:32:30,978
And they would always say,

1877
01:32:31,082 --> 01:32:32,549
"The only way
to save our town

1878
01:32:32,650 --> 01:32:35,278
is to blow
Arlington Springs up."

1879
01:32:35,386 --> 01:32:36,853
They would say shit like,

1880
01:32:36,954 --> 01:32:40,856
"Make
the nigger cockroaches burn,"

1881
01:32:40,958 --> 01:32:42,289
shit like that,
you know?

1882
01:32:42,393 --> 01:32:44,918
- So how'd he feel
when he found out

1883
01:32:45,029 --> 01:32:47,088
that you were
dating a black man?

1884
01:32:47,198 --> 01:32:50,497
- Oh, he was-
he was so angry,

1885
01:32:50,601 --> 01:32:52,592
like, crazy angry.

1886
01:32:52,704 --> 01:32:55,070
He started chasing me down,
okay?

1887
01:32:55,173 --> 01:32:56,197
He chased me down,

1888
01:32:56,307 --> 01:32:59,140
and he started whipping me
with his belt.

1889
01:32:59,243 --> 01:33:00,972
I mean, he was
just going crazy, you know,

1890
01:33:01,079 --> 01:33:02,376
like,
saying shit to me like,

1891
01:33:02,480 --> 01:33:05,643
"You're nothing but a dirty
nigger-loving whore,

1892
01:33:05,750 --> 01:33:08,241
dirty nigger-loving whore,
dirty nigger-loving whore."

1893
01:33:12,190 --> 01:33:13,179
- What the fuck are you doing

1894
01:33:13,291 --> 01:33:14,622
when they're
over here whipping me?

1895
01:33:14,726 --> 01:33:17,752
- Mr. Beckett, do you ever
call blacks "niggers"?

1896
01:33:17,862 --> 01:33:19,193
- Oh, of course
I call them niggers,

1897
01:33:19,297 --> 01:33:20,992
you uppity piece of shit.

1898
01:33:21,099 --> 01:33:23,226
Can't think
of any folks down here

1899
01:33:23,334 --> 01:33:24,892
that don't
call you people niggers.

1900
01:33:26,404 --> 01:33:29,567
Yet race has nothing to do
with whom you prosecute as DA?

1901
01:33:59,437 --> 01:34:02,338
- Sam, Byron.

1902
01:34:02,440 --> 01:34:06,171
He practically
ordered them to settle.

1903
01:34:06,277 --> 01:34:07,904
There's no way
he wanted that tape

1904
01:34:08,012 --> 01:34:10,139
played in a Texas courtroom.

1905
01:34:10,248 --> 01:34:11,909
It's over.

[Laughing]

- Oh, my goodness.

- Oh, my gosh,
we did it.

1911

[Laughing]

1912
01:34:24,929 --> 01:34:25,953
- Well?

1913
01:34:26,063 --> 01:34:27,621
- Let's get out of here.

1914
01:34:28,733 --> 01:34:30,564
- I want to go...

1915
01:34:33,671 --> 01:34:34,660
- Hm.

1916
01:34:34,772 --> 01:34:37,138
- Can you believe that?

1917
01:34:37,241 --> 01:34:38,936
Isn't he yours, Dee?

1918
01:34:42,647 --> 01:34:46,276
- They've offered to disband
the drug task force

1919
01:34:46,384 --> 01:34:49,911
and to give each of the accused
a small settlement.

1920
01:34:50,021 --> 01:34:52,387
- What about Gladys?

1921
01:34:52,490 --> 01:34:53,514
- She's no longer a felon,

1922
01:34:53,624 --> 01:34:57,219
so she can move back
into Arlington Springs.

1923
01:34:57,328 --> 01:34:58,352
- And our arrest records?

1924
01:34:58,463 --> 01:34:59,452
- Expunged.

1925
01:35:01,866 --> 01:35:03,561
- And Beckett?

1926
01:35:03,668 --> 01:35:06,569
- Dee, we did
everything we could.

1927
01:35:06,671 --> 01:35:08,298
Beckett
will have to face the voters.

1928
01:35:08,406 --> 01:35:10,533
But that's the best
we could do.

1929
01:35:10,641 --> 01:35:11,869
The judge was firm on that,

1930
01:35:11,976 --> 01:35:14,672
that Beckett's future
be decided by the voters.

1931
01:35:18,716 --> 01:35:19,978
- Will this stop the raids?

1932
01:35:20,084 --> 01:35:22,552
- I think so.

1933
01:35:22,653 --> 01:35:23,677
I really think so.

01:35:57,688 --> 01:36:01,146
- Sam?

1936
01:36:01,259 --> 01:36:02,658
- Yeah.

1937
01:36:02,760 --> 01:36:03,852
- Is everything all right?

1938
01:36:05,530 --> 01:36:06,997
- Yeah, yeah.

1939
01:36:07,098 --> 01:36:09,589
Everything's all right.

1940
01:36:23,247 --> 01:36:24,771
- Now, in our congregation,

1941
01:36:24,882 --> 01:36:30,218
there is a woman
that has struggled

1942
01:36:30,321 --> 01:36:32,619
and suffered

1943
01:36:32,723 --> 01:36:34,714
and prevailed,

1944
01:36:34,825 --> 01:36:37,419
not just for herself

1945
01:36:37,528 --> 01:36:41,897
but for us all.

1946
01:36:41,999 --> 01:36:44,627
Now, I'm gonna have
to call out Dee Roberts.

1947
01:36:44,735 --> 01:36:46,896
Dee Roberts,

1948
01:36:47,004 --> 01:36:49,632
I'm asking you
to stand up

1949
01:36:49,740 --> 01:36:53,437
and accept
our warmest thanks.

1950
01:36:53,544 --> 01:36:54,909
Come on, y'all.

1951
01:36:55,012 --> 01:37:02,441
[Cheers and applause]

1952
01:37:02,553 --> 01:37:03,645
Yeah.

1953
01:37:09,894 --> 01:37:15,059
- I wish
I knew how it would feel

1954
01:37:15,166 --> 01:37:18,192
to be free

1955
01:37:18,302 --> 01:37:21,294
I wish I could break

1956
01:37:21,405 --> 01:37:24,966
all the chains
holding me

1957
01:37:26,043 --> 01:37:29,308
I wish I could say

1958
01:37:29,413 --> 01:37:33,076
all the things
that I should say

1959
01:37:33,184 --> 01:37:35,152
Say 'em loud

1960
01:37:35,252 --> 01:37:37,049
Say 'em clear

1961
01:37:37,154 --> 01:37:41,716
for the whole
round world to hear

1962
01:37:41,826 --> 01:37:44,954
I wish I could share

1963
01:37:45,062 --> 01:37:49,556
All the love
that's in my heart

1964
01:37:49,667 --> 01:37:52,636
Remove all the bars

1965
01:37:52,737 --> 01:37:57,401
that keep us apart

1966
01:37:57,508 --> 01:38:00,568
I wish you could know

1967
01:38:00,678 --> 01:38:04,444
what it means
to be me

1968
01:38:04,548 --> 01:38:08,143
Then you'd see
and agree

1969
01:38:08,252 --> 01:38:13,087
that it ever man
should be free

1970
01:38:13,190 --> 01:38:16,591
I wish I could give

1971
01:38:16,694 --> 01:38:19,356
all I'm longing to give

1972
01:38:20,665 --> 01:38:24,294
I wish I could relive

1973
01:38:24,402 --> 01:38:28,634
like I'm longing to live

1974
01:38:28,739 --> 01:38:31,833
I wish I could do

1975
01:38:31,942 --> 01:38:35,878
all the things
that I can do

1976
01:38:35,980 --> 01:38:40,076
Though I'm way overdue

1977
01:38:40,184 --> 01:38:44,052
I'd be starting anew

1978
01:38:44,155 --> 01:38:47,454
Well, I wish I could be

1979
01:38:47,558 --> 01:38:52,120
like a bird
in the sky

1980
01:38:52,229 --> 01:38:55,630
How sweet it would be

1981
01:38:55,733 --> 01:38:59,794
if I found
I could fly

1982
01:38:59,904 --> 01:39:03,169
Oh, I'd soar
to the sun

1983
01:39:03,274 --> 01:39:07,267
and look down
at the sea

1984
01:39:07,378 --> 01:39:11,439
Then I'd sing
'cause I know, yeah

1985
01:39:11,549 --> 01:39:15,076
not sing
'cause I'm known, yeah

1986
01:39:15,186 --> 01:39:18,246
Then I'd sing
'cause I know

1987
01:39:18,355 --> 01:39:21,381
I know how it feels

1988
01:39:21,492 --> 01:39:24,586
Oh, I know
how it feels

1989
01:39:24,695 --> 01:39:25,787
to be free

1990
01:39:25,896 --> 01:39:27,227
Yeah, yeah

1991
01:39:27,331 --> 01:39:30,300
I know how it feels

1992
01:39:30,401 --> 01:39:33,859
Yes, I know,
oh, I know

1993
01:39:33,971 --> 01:39:36,371
how it feels

1994
01:39:36,474 --> 01:39:38,339
how it feels

1995
01:39:38,442 --> 01:39:39,739
to be free

1996
01:39:39,844 --> 01:39:41,835
Lord, Lord, Lord
