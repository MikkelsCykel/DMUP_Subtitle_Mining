1
00:00:03,753 --> 00:00:05,914
<i>4:22 on a sunny Thursday afternoon...</i>

2
00:00:05,989 --> 00:00:07,820
<i>here in Chicago on K-LITE.</i>

3
00:00:08,258 --> 00:00:10,749
<i>Now here's one
for all you rush-hour rockers.</i>

4
00:00:10,827 --> 00:00:13,660
<i>The Beach Boys, Good Vibrations.</i>

5
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:45,747
<i>Honey, I'm home!</i>

6
00:01:48,792 --> 00:01:49,781
<i>Hi, honey.</i>

7
00:01:50,927 --> 00:01:52,394
Smells good.

8
00:01:52,629 --> 00:01:54,494
<i>- Can I have...
- Don't, don't!</i>

9
00:01:54,564 --> 00:01:56,623
Come in here and gather around!

10
00:01:57,467 --> 00:01:59,560
- I must show you something!
- My new car?

11
00:01:59,969 --> 00:02:01,231
Keep dreaming.

12
00:02:01,437 --> 00:02:03,428
<i>Here, eat these.</i>

13
00:02:07,343 --> 00:02:09,573
- They're chocolate chip.
- They're delicious.

14
00:02:09,746 --> 00:02:10,906
They're four years old.

15
00:02:16,019 --> 00:02:17,577
Anyone for milk?

16
00:02:17,754 --> 00:02:19,187
Eight years old.

17
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:23,421
It's my long-life food preservative.
It's been approved!

18
00:02:23,626 --> 00:02:25,059
I got my big bonus!

19
00:02:27,463 --> 00:02:29,522
- Congratulations.
- Isn't it great?

20
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:31,791
And...

21
00:02:31,968 --> 00:02:33,299
that's not all.

22
00:02:33,469 --> 00:02:35,130
Mr. Turner thinks a guy like...

23
00:02:35,305 --> 00:02:37,569
Clark Griswold deserves a few days off.

24
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:41,471
And Clark Griswold thinks
he should take those days off and...

25
00:02:41,644 --> 00:02:44,909
take his family on a fabulous vacation to...

26
00:02:46,182 --> 00:02:48,844
fantastic Las Vegas!

27
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:54,688
There's nothing to do there.

28
00:02:54,757 --> 00:02:59,319
<i>Clark, I don't think that Las Vegas
is the kind of place you take a family.</i>

29
00:03:00,029 --> 00:03:01,496
<i>Oh, come on.</i>

30
00:03:01,664 --> 00:03:03,996
<i>Las Vegas has changed, Ellen.</i>

31
00:03:04,167 --> 00:03:07,102
It's the number-one family
destination in America.

32
00:03:08,471 --> 00:03:11,406
I'm not going.
The people there are so phony.

33
00:03:11,574 --> 00:03:13,405
Is there legalized prostitution?

34
00:03:13,576 --> 00:03:15,134
Not within the city limits.

35
00:03:15,311 --> 00:03:17,074
But there is...

36
00:03:17,247 --> 00:03:20,307
<i>first-class entertainment,
beautiful scenery...</i>

37
00:03:21,517 --> 00:03:24,850
and all the shrimp cocktail you can eat.

38
00:03:26,656 --> 00:03:27,748
<i>Listen, everybody...</i>

39
00:03:27,924 --> 00:03:31,758
how many more chances will we get
to do something as a family?

40
00:03:31,928 --> 00:03:34,419
Ellen and I are always working.

41
00:03:34,597 --> 00:03:39,091
And you guys are growing up so fast
I hardly recognize you anymore.

42
00:03:41,838 --> 00:03:45,103
Okay. There's one more reason
why you should all go.

43
00:03:49,012 --> 00:03:50,843
I'm remarrying your mom...

44
00:03:51,347 --> 00:03:52,780
if she'll have me.

45
00:03:54,017 --> 00:03:55,678
<i>Really, Sparky?</i>

46
00:03:56,619 --> 00:04:00,020
What do you say? My 20th anniversary.
I could use a best man.

47
00:04:00,857 --> 00:04:02,791
Have a bridesmaid in mind?

48
00:04:02,859 --> 00:04:04,850
- How about Audrey?
- Audrey who?

49
00:04:05,295 --> 00:04:06,284
Dad!

50
00:04:06,362 --> 00:04:08,262
What do you say? Let's do it!

51
00:04:08,364 --> 00:04:11,856
I think this is going to be
the greatest vacation ever.

52
00:04:28,484 --> 00:04:31,214
You know you look
really beautiful right now?

53
00:04:38,227 --> 00:04:39,387
<i>You know, honey...</i>

54
00:04:40,163 --> 00:04:43,655
the guys at work tell me there's
this club we can join if we...

55
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,489
meet in the bathroom.

56
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:50,002
<i>Clark, are you serious?</i>

57
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:52,034
<i>You love me, don't you?</i>

58
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:53,937
<i>I do, but here?</i>

59
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:55,099
Now?

60
00:04:55,945 --> 00:04:58,038
We've been married 20 years.

61
00:05:00,283 --> 00:05:01,272
How do we do it?

62
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:04,212
<i>Go first, I'll be behind you.</i>

63
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:10,048
Are you okay? You look red.

64
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:12,057
Just going to the restroom.

65
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:26,238
Excuse me.

66
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:27,899
Where're you going?

67
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:32,480
Your mother's got something in her eye.
I'm going to...

68
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:34,740
help her get it out.

69
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:21,787
Maybe we should...

70
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:23,192
join...

71
00:06:23,366 --> 00:06:25,800
some other kind of club.

72
00:06:26,536 --> 00:06:28,697
I just want time with you.

73
00:06:29,705 --> 00:06:31,969
I just think there's...

74
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:35,471
- a better time...
- This will be our best one.

75
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:38,972
<i>Foot, foot!</i>

76
00:06:39,148 --> 00:06:41,309
I got it. I got it.

77
00:06:44,387 --> 00:06:46,150
I'll never fly again.

78
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:47,983
The pilot was helpful.

79
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:49,818
The whole plane applauded.

80
00:06:49,992 --> 00:06:52,483
<i>If you want to use these bathrooms,
we'll wait.</i>

81
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:54,254
Is this ours?

82
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:58,323
- A limo?
- We're the Griswolds.

83
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:00,992
<i>Sorry, my pen burst in the altitude.</i>

84
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:02,732
- I'm sorry.
- No problem.

85
00:07:02,905 --> 00:07:04,497
<i>Come this way, please.</i>

86
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:06,665
This is it. This is it.

87
00:07:15,184 --> 00:07:16,344
Look at this.

88
00:07:37,673 --> 00:07:39,732
Wayne Newton.

89
00:08:08,171 --> 00:08:09,536
It's beautiful!

90
00:08:12,708 --> 00:08:14,266
You must see this.

91
00:08:21,884 --> 00:08:23,283
Daddy!

92
00:08:23,986 --> 00:08:24,975
Help!

93
00:08:25,054 --> 00:08:26,453
I'm stuck!

94
00:08:28,558 --> 00:08:31,288
<i>Vegas, Vegas, Vegas.</i>

95
00:08:46,309 --> 00:08:48,573
Look! I think you'll want to see this!

96
00:09:09,765 --> 00:09:10,993
Is this it?

97
00:09:11,267 --> 00:09:13,667
Welcome to the fabulous Mirage.

98
00:09:17,607 --> 00:09:20,770
<i>Don't worry,
it won't leave a permanent line.</i>

99
00:09:21,944 --> 00:09:24,435
<i>Come on, there's a lot to do.</i>

100
00:09:24,614 --> 00:09:26,605
There's a lot to do.

101
00:09:32,288 --> 00:09:34,188
Welcome. Your credit card.

102
00:09:34,357 --> 00:09:35,346
<i>Yes, indeed.</i>

103
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:36,447
<i>Griswold, four.</i>

104
00:09:36,859 --> 00:09:40,351
<i>We have an excellent dry-cleaning service,
if you're so inclined.</i>

105
00:09:40,529 --> 00:09:42,292
It's a birthmark.

106
00:09:45,468 --> 00:09:49,370
<i>To get to your room,
go through the casino, veer to the left.</i>

107
00:09:49,538 --> 00:09:54,202
Take a right at the first palm tree.
You'll see a group of blackjack tables.

108
00:09:54,377 --> 00:09:56,368
<i>Not baccarat, not craps. Blackjack.</i>

109
00:09:56,545 --> 00:09:58,809
Turn right and wind around left.

110
00:09:58,981 --> 00:10:01,381
<i>If you get to the pool, you've gone too far.</i>

111
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:05,646
<i>You'll see elevators.
They aren't yours, stay away from them.</i>

112
00:10:05,821 --> 00:10:09,052
<i>Keep walking, you'll see
more elevators, the gold ones.</i>

113
00:10:09,225 --> 00:10:11,318
Those are yours. Go to the 10th floor.

114
00:10:11,494 --> 00:10:12,893
You'll find your room.

115
00:10:14,664 --> 00:10:16,222
Any questions?

116
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:19,323
<i>No, not really.</i>

117
00:10:20,236 --> 00:10:21,567
Russ!

118
00:10:21,737 --> 00:10:23,500
Did you get that?

119
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,400
<i>Well, let's go then. Thanks.</i>

120
00:10:30,746 --> 00:10:32,179
Good luck!

121
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:45,249
What's this?

122
00:10:48,764 --> 00:10:52,860
Look at these people. Blinded
by glitter and the almighty dollar.

123
00:11:17,393 --> 00:11:18,917
The elevators are there.

124
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:20,756
<i>Hold on, honey.</i>

125
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:24,832
They always put the machines
that pay the most in front.

126
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:26,159
$5?

127
00:11:26,502 --> 00:11:27,491
Here we go!

128
00:11:36,812 --> 00:11:41,146
<i>You see, Las Vegas is already
bringing us closer together.</i>

129
00:11:41,917 --> 00:11:43,748
Let's go to the room.

130
00:11:47,089 --> 00:11:48,989
<i>Honey, call up the kids.</i>

131
00:11:49,492 --> 00:11:51,084
See how they like this.

132
00:11:56,332 --> 00:11:58,926
<i>Rusty and Audrey Griswold, please.</i>

133
00:12:09,445 --> 00:12:11,777
We're right next door.
Can't we get our own rooms?

134
00:12:12,114 --> 00:12:14,514
Please don't spoil your daddy's fun.

135
00:12:14,683 --> 00:12:16,344
<i>Dad, we're too old for this.</i>

136
00:12:21,857 --> 00:12:23,290
Sit down.

137
00:12:24,527 --> 00:12:25,619
Kids...

138
00:12:26,028 --> 00:12:27,859
remember when you were babies?

139
00:12:30,199 --> 00:12:31,962
It was a wonderful time.

140
00:12:33,369 --> 00:12:34,961
We had your cribs right in our room.

141
00:12:35,037 --> 00:12:37,699
We'd wrap you up in little blankets...

142
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:42,136
and roll you back and forth
across the bed into each other.

143
00:12:43,212 --> 00:12:44,201
Those days...

144
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:46,211
they're almost over.

145
00:12:48,651 --> 00:12:49,640
So...

146
00:12:50,219 --> 00:12:54,713
<i>To close out that wonderful chapter,
I got tickets to Siegfried and Roy.</i>

147
00:12:55,558 --> 00:12:56,991
Best show on the planet?

148
00:12:57,159 --> 00:12:58,820
Masters of the impossible?

149
00:12:59,662 --> 00:13:02,324
We're going because we're the Griswolds!

150
00:13:02,498 --> 00:13:05,592
Can't you just wrap me up in a blanket
and roll me across the bed?

151
00:13:06,168 --> 00:13:08,193
<i>No, Russ. Get dressed.</i>

152
00:13:16,745 --> 00:13:18,679
Want to try some blackjack?

153
00:13:19,014 --> 00:13:22,074
<i>What do you know about blackjack, Clark?</i>

154
00:13:22,685 --> 00:13:24,585
You forget I was in the Army.

155
00:13:25,521 --> 00:13:27,682
You weren't in the Army.

156
00:13:27,857 --> 00:13:31,349
<i>Not in the Army, but I have
played cards with men in uniform.</i>

157
00:13:32,928 --> 00:13:35,692
Just don't want you to lose
all your money.

158
00:13:36,599 --> 00:13:40,933
When a man can come to Las Vegas
with a few extra bucks in his pocket...

159
00:13:41,103 --> 00:13:43,594
throw a ten-spot down on a table...

160
00:13:43,772 --> 00:13:46,605
pay an extra dollar
for a steak with his eggs...

161
00:13:46,775 --> 00:13:49,039
that's a happy day for that man.

162
00:13:49,211 --> 00:13:51,270
When his woman is at his side...

163
00:13:53,482 --> 00:13:55,473
Is that Wayne Newton?

164
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:57,814
<i>Why, you want his autograph?</i>

165
00:13:57,987 --> 00:14:00,080
I think he's staring at me.

166
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:04,321
<i>No, no, no. I must be tired.</i>

167
00:14:04,493 --> 00:14:06,484
Maybe I'll go find the kids.

168
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:10,656
I think they want a little time
away from Mama and Papa Bear.

169
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:12,926
Let's let them get in trouble.

170
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:17,270
- I'm asking for $5!
- What'll you do if you win?

171
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:19,836
You're boring to travel with.

172
00:14:20,009 --> 00:14:24,275
<i>Fine, you want $5?
Here, you're a big man. Here's $5.</i>

173
00:14:24,513 --> 00:14:25,775
Get a wallet.

174
00:14:29,184 --> 00:14:30,776
- Hi.
- Good evening.

175
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,681
Would the two of you have any ID?

176
00:14:34,757 --> 00:14:38,249
<i>We left our IDs upstairs, actually.
We're on our honeymoon.</i>

177
00:14:38,427 --> 00:14:41,828
Wait here for two minutes.
I'll go upstairs and get the ID.

178
00:14:41,997 --> 00:14:43,589
I'll be right back.

179
00:14:46,835 --> 00:14:48,097
My friend...

180
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:49,430
$200 in chips.

181
00:14:49,939 --> 00:14:52,430
Good evening. Changing $200!

182
00:14:54,777 --> 00:14:59,441
<i>In blackjack, a smart player has
a mathematical advantage over the house.</i>

183
00:15:01,016 --> 00:15:02,779
Are you a professional?

184
00:15:02,952 --> 00:15:05,113
<i>Me? No, not really.</i>

185
00:15:05,688 --> 00:15:06,677
Are you?

186
00:15:15,531 --> 00:15:16,862
<i>Place your bet, sir.</i>

187
00:15:17,032 --> 00:15:18,522
<i>Yes, the bet.</i>

188
00:15:20,369 --> 00:15:21,358
What the hell.

189
00:15:25,808 --> 00:15:27,708
- Hit me.
- It's a bust!

190
00:15:27,876 --> 00:15:30,470
Las Vegas Fun Police.
Hand over your chips.

191
00:15:30,646 --> 00:15:32,341
- Eddie?
- Twenty-two.

192
00:15:32,548 --> 00:15:33,537
Player busts.

193
00:15:36,485 --> 00:15:39,386
<i>Oh, man, it is a blazer out there.</i>

194
00:15:39,722 --> 00:15:43,385
You're lucky you got air conditioning
in here like mother nature intended.

195
00:15:44,393 --> 00:15:48,159
<i>Clark Griswold, did you think
you could come to Las Vegas...</i>

196
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:50,662
and not see your favorite cousin?

197
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:51,822
Your bet.

198
00:15:52,001 --> 00:15:52,990
There.

199
00:15:53,168 --> 00:15:54,897
Why're you in Las Vegas?

200
00:15:55,337 --> 00:15:58,738
Where else can you wear shorts
24 hours a day?

201
00:16:00,576 --> 00:16:02,567
I am on fire!

202
00:16:02,845 --> 00:16:03,834
What?

203
00:16:03,912 --> 00:16:05,243
Shuffling!

204
00:16:06,015 --> 00:16:07,346
Here's the best part.

205
00:16:07,516 --> 00:16:09,575
Thanks to that defective plate
in my head...

206
00:16:09,752 --> 00:16:13,244
the V.A. Gave me a huge plot of land
just north of town.

207
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:17,525
<i>Every time I belch,
the plate shifts and my legs give out.</i>

208
00:16:17,693 --> 00:16:19,752
But what a view!

209
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:22,522
Nineteen.

210
00:16:23,766 --> 00:16:24,790
Twenty!

211
00:16:24,867 --> 00:16:26,858
<i>Oh, he's good!</i>

212
00:16:27,436 --> 00:16:29,267
He's good!

213
00:16:31,874 --> 00:16:35,037
<i>- Another $100 in chips, please.
- Changing $100!</i>

214
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:36,700
<i>That's it, Clark.</i>

215
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:38,210
Show them who's boss.

216
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:42,441
It's people who blow the family
nest egg here that built this town.

217
00:16:42,618 --> 00:16:44,552
Not this pretty boy.

218
00:16:53,395 --> 00:16:55,295
<i>Oh, gee!</i>

219
00:16:56,131 --> 00:16:57,894
I can't believe it.

220
00:16:58,967 --> 00:17:01,458
I've lost $300 in 15 minutes?

221
00:17:07,743 --> 00:17:09,802
I'm okay. I'm okay.

222
00:18:03,799 --> 00:18:04,857
You're kind.

223
00:18:06,268 --> 00:18:08,259
What a great audience.

224
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:09,803
<i>Yeah, all right.</i>

225
00:18:11,473 --> 00:18:13,031
Terrific!

226
00:18:13,475 --> 00:18:15,375
Where do you come from?

227
00:18:15,544 --> 00:18:17,637
<i>Me? Chicago, Illinois.</i>

228
00:18:17,813 --> 00:18:19,144
- Fantastic.
- Chicago!

229
00:18:20,382 --> 00:18:22,543
Why don't you come on stage?

230
00:18:22,718 --> 00:18:24,049
<i>Come on, it'll be fun.</i>

231
00:18:24,219 --> 00:18:25,811
<i>- Go on!
- Yeah, Dad, do it!</i>

232
00:18:26,555 --> 00:18:28,489
<i>Okay, I'll play along.</i>

233
00:18:32,127 --> 00:18:33,185
Applaud!

234
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:35,852
Good to have you.

235
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:38,431
What's your name?

236
00:18:39,301 --> 00:18:40,598
Clark Griswold.

237
00:18:40,669 --> 00:18:41,658
Marvelous!

238
00:18:41,737 --> 00:18:43,864
Let's do some real magic.

239
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,371
<i>Listen, I know the routine.</i>

240
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:50,205
What's it going to be tonight?
Wires? Mirrors? Trap doors?

241
00:18:51,947 --> 00:18:53,938
I happen to know a little magic myself.

242
00:18:54,149 --> 00:18:56,117
I don't know if you've seen this.

243
00:18:58,153 --> 00:18:59,950
Can you tell it's my thumb?

244
00:19:00,155 --> 00:19:02,214
<i>Looks like it is, but it's not.</i>

245
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:05,290
<i>Whatever, I'll do what you want.</i>

246
00:19:05,661 --> 00:19:06,889
I'm here to help.

247
00:19:08,864 --> 00:19:09,956
Enter.

248
00:19:10,165 --> 00:19:12,065
<i>Okay, I know this one.</i>

249
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:14,168
<i>- Trust me.
- All right, I will.</i>

250
00:19:16,939 --> 00:19:19,430
Is this going up? I'll go with it.

251
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:21,364
Me.

252
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:23,432
Where's Dad?

253
00:20:23,605 --> 00:20:25,766
I haven't got a clue.

254
00:21:00,309 --> 00:21:02,539
How'd you do at the tables?

255
00:21:04,813 --> 00:21:05,802
I'm about even.

256
00:21:09,484 --> 00:21:10,712
Why'd you say we were here?

257
00:21:10,886 --> 00:21:15,482
<i>Oh, come on. How often do I get
to see my cousin Catherine?</i>

258
00:21:16,391 --> 00:21:19,155
<i>Anyway, we're just stopping by for lunch.</i>

259
00:21:19,828 --> 00:21:21,159
I want to gamble.

260
00:21:23,165 --> 00:21:24,223
Russell...

261
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:27,066
I never want to hear you say that again.

262
00:21:27,235 --> 00:21:30,329
Gambling is a very serious business.

263
00:21:30,739 --> 00:21:31,899
Is that clear?

264
00:21:32,574 --> 00:21:34,337
Excuse me a minute.

265
00:21:57,032 --> 00:21:58,260
$50 on black.

266
00:21:58,433 --> 00:21:59,525
No more bets.

267
00:22:01,203 --> 00:22:03,603
Red 25! Red wins!

268
00:22:03,772 --> 00:22:05,603
Jeez!

269
00:22:24,393 --> 00:22:25,724
Shall we?

270
00:23:15,343 --> 00:23:17,174
Remember me?

271
00:23:17,846 --> 00:23:19,279
Yes.

272
00:23:26,288 --> 00:23:27,846
Love you.

273
00:23:39,301 --> 00:23:41,030
Your baby?

274
00:23:56,551 --> 00:23:58,519
Are you watching for an address?

275
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:00,086
What block is this?

276
00:24:00,255 --> 00:24:01,745
<i>Very funny, Russ.</i>

277
00:24:02,023 --> 00:24:03,684
Will you check the map again?

278
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:05,349
Could that be it?

279
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:09,186
Eddie said there was room for a pool.

280
00:24:09,364 --> 00:24:11,264
Get out the sunscreen.

281
00:24:19,474 --> 00:24:21,533
Cousins!

282
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:23,271
What do you think?

283
00:24:24,479 --> 00:24:28,381
Can you believe they tested H-bombs
on this beautiful property?

284
00:24:30,285 --> 00:24:32,116
I missed you so much.

285
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:41,385
Don't you worry about radiation?

286
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:44,565
All I know is my teeth
have never been whiter...

287
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:46,894
and my garden has 50-pound tomatoes.

288
00:24:49,004 --> 00:24:51,063
<i>Denny boy, come on over here!</i>

289
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:53,070
Look at that view.

290
00:24:53,241 --> 00:24:56,904
<i>It's government property around us,
so no one will build.</i>

291
00:24:58,246 --> 00:24:59,304
Look at this one.

292
00:25:01,249 --> 00:25:02,739
They grow up so fast.

293
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:05,818
I tell him he'll pierce
himself shut one day...

294
00:25:06,021 --> 00:25:07,249
but what can you do?

295
00:25:07,422 --> 00:25:09,014
He likes eating through a straw.

296
00:25:09,157 --> 00:25:11,751
They must make their own mistakes.

297
00:25:14,863 --> 00:25:15,852
Does that hurt?

298
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:16,920
It's not bad.

299
00:25:17,165 --> 00:25:18,530
Who's hungry?

300
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:23,036
Need help with the grill?

301
00:25:23,171 --> 00:25:25,765
<i>No, thanks. Don't have one.</i>

302
00:25:33,548 --> 00:25:35,175
I'll get the tongs.

303
00:25:40,555 --> 00:25:43,456
Renewing your wedding vows?

304
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:46,287
<i>Oh, that's so wonderful.</i>

305
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:50,287
I wish Eddie and I had time
for that sort of thing.

306
00:25:50,465 --> 00:25:53,059
But with the constant windstorms...

307
00:25:53,201 --> 00:25:54,964
and flash floods...

308
00:25:55,136 --> 00:25:57,070
oppressive heat and...

309
00:25:57,205 --> 00:25:58,467
home-schooling...

310
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,130
we don't have a minute free.

311
00:26:00,308 --> 00:26:01,969
Can you hand me that mitt?

312
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,643
I love the kitchenette.

313
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:09,147
<i>Oh, thanks.</i>

314
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:12,377
<i>Listen, things could be a lot worse.</i>

315
00:26:12,587 --> 00:26:14,578
<i>Yeah, you could be pregnant again.</i>

316
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:22,224
I've been...

317
00:26:22,397 --> 00:26:25,093
earning money testing fertility drugs.

318
00:26:25,233 --> 00:26:27,167
This one's going to be a winner.

319
00:26:28,403 --> 00:26:30,496
Everyone loves a baby.

320
00:26:33,108 --> 00:26:34,666
<i>Yeah, life is good.</i>

321
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:36,504
My kids are thriving.

322
00:26:36,745 --> 00:26:39,839
Little Ruby-Sue must have grown a foot
since you saw her last.

323
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:42,176
<i>Daddy, I caught another snake.</i>

324
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:43,715
<i>That's good, sweetheart.</i>

325
00:26:43,885 --> 00:26:46,046
Put it in the pit with the others.

326
00:26:46,221 --> 00:26:47,984
And go work on your typing.

327
00:26:52,327 --> 00:26:53,487
Nice kids.

328
00:26:55,563 --> 00:26:57,895
Don't ever pick me up again...

329
00:26:58,066 --> 00:26:59,328
jerk!

330
00:27:03,238 --> 00:27:05,331
Look who's home!

331
00:27:06,074 --> 00:27:08,668
This one here's my pride and joy.

332
00:27:10,845 --> 00:27:14,042
<i>Lord is my witness, I hate this heat!</i>

333
00:27:14,115 --> 00:27:18,176
If it ain't gluing your butt to a seat
it's making you sweat like an animal!

334
00:27:18,353 --> 00:27:20,412
And I want something better!

335
00:27:21,423 --> 00:27:23,186
<i>Hey, everybody.</i>

336
00:27:23,758 --> 00:27:25,749
You remember Vickie?

337
00:27:25,927 --> 00:27:27,861
She's a dancer now.

338
00:27:28,029 --> 00:27:29,360
Her picture's everywhere.

339
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:32,292
<i>Phone booths, men's rooms...</i>

340
00:27:32,367 --> 00:27:33,698
She's famous.

341
00:27:33,868 --> 00:27:37,031
Show them that little move
I taught you there.

342
00:27:48,883 --> 00:27:52,216
Don't think unnatural thoughts
about your cousin.

343
00:27:58,626 --> 00:28:01,789
She's got her mama's looks and
her daddy's sense of balance.

344
00:28:01,996 --> 00:28:04,692
<i>Hose down, kids! Chicken's almost ready!</i>

345
00:28:04,833 --> 00:28:06,596
My chicken's dry as hell.

346
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:08,702
<i>Mine's dry as hell, too.</i>

347
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:12,100
<i>If you want to be with me tonight,
I'll give you my beeper number.</i>

348
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,499
Really? That'd be great.

349
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:18,604
<i>If you're still hungry,
I can get the salad from the dog.</i>

350
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:21,840
<i>As appealing as that sounds,
we really must go.</i>

351
00:28:22,016 --> 00:28:25,383
We have a lot of sightseeing to do
and I added tetanus shot to the list.

352
00:28:25,587 --> 00:28:29,990
Sorry about the tablecloth. Rusty's
never had that reaction to poultry.

353
00:28:30,725 --> 00:28:32,522
He ain't used to home cooking.

354
00:28:32,727 --> 00:28:33,716
Are you?

355
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:36,490
He's sick.

356
00:28:36,731 --> 00:28:37,857
Anyway...

357
00:28:38,366 --> 00:28:39,856
He'll be okay.

358
00:28:40,034 --> 00:28:41,729
I wish you two could come...

359
00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:44,737
<i>but no room for the kids,
so thanks for lunch, and bye.</i>

360
00:28:44,873 --> 00:28:46,465
<i>Not so fast, Clark.</i>

361
00:28:46,641 --> 00:28:48,233
I'll get the babysitter.

362
00:28:52,247 --> 00:28:53,236
<i>Hey, kids...</i>

363
00:28:53,481 --> 00:28:55,745
round-up time!

364
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:02,316
They'll keep busy.

365
00:29:03,491 --> 00:29:04,788
Where are we going?

366
00:29:06,528 --> 00:29:07,620
Hoover Dam!

367
00:29:07,796 --> 00:29:12,028
Over 1000 feet wide and
727 feet to the bottom.

368
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,633
Where can I buy bait?

369
00:29:13,802 --> 00:29:17,704
I love electricity.
Eddie says we'll get some soon.

370
00:29:18,306 --> 00:29:20,467
What a magnificent achievement.

371
00:29:22,277 --> 00:29:25,440
This is a family vacation.
Try to stay with the family.

372
00:29:25,647 --> 00:29:26,636
<i>Sorry, honey.</i>

373
00:29:26,881 --> 00:29:29,975
<i>This way, please.
The tour is about to start.</i>

374
00:29:32,387 --> 00:29:33,877
<i>Welcome, everyone.</i>

375
00:29:34,055 --> 00:29:36,387
<i>I am your dam guide, Arnie.</i>

376
00:29:36,825 --> 00:29:40,989
I'm about to take you through
a fully functioning power plant.

377
00:29:41,396 --> 00:29:42,727
<i>So, please...</i>

378
00:29:42,897 --> 00:29:45,559
no one wander off the dam tour.

379
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,060
<i>Please, take all the dam pictures
you want.</i>

380
00:29:49,504 --> 00:29:51,495
<i>Now, any dam questions?</i>

381
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,174
Where can I get some dam bait?

382
00:29:56,911 --> 00:29:58,674
<i>This way, please.</i>

383
00:30:00,181 --> 00:30:01,512
What'd he say?

384
00:30:01,916 --> 00:30:03,247
This way.

385
00:30:05,253 --> 00:30:08,586
Don't worry about water leaking
through the rocks. It's normal.

386
00:30:08,756 --> 00:30:10,747
<i>Please, keep up with the tour.</i>

387
00:30:14,362 --> 00:30:17,525
This is one of the oldest
dam tunnels we have.

388
00:30:20,768 --> 00:30:21,757
Come here!

389
00:30:23,838 --> 00:30:24,964
Give me your gum.

390
00:30:25,273 --> 00:30:26,433
From my mouth?

391
00:30:26,608 --> 00:30:29,270
Any gum! Look what's happening here!

392
00:30:29,444 --> 00:30:31,105
- Here.
- I'll catch up.

393
00:30:56,571 --> 00:30:57,902
Damn it.

394
00:31:23,765 --> 00:31:26,097
Where is the damn dam tour?

395
00:31:29,003 --> 00:31:31,164
<i>Oh, boy. Oh, boy.</i>

396
00:31:46,788 --> 00:31:51,282
And there are over 100 million tons
of cement in these walls.

397
00:31:55,964 --> 00:31:57,693
Hello. Hello.

398
00:31:58,299 --> 00:31:59,527
Help!

399
00:32:20,655 --> 00:32:22,384
It's not that high.

400
00:32:34,902 --> 00:32:36,494
<i>Okay, here we go.</i>

401
00:32:36,671 --> 00:32:38,229
Let's see if I've still got it.

402
00:32:48,082 --> 00:32:50,016
Nice breeze up here.

403
00:32:52,854 --> 00:32:55,186
That's how a power plant works.

404
00:32:55,690 --> 00:32:56,850
How?

405
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,930
This tour gets better every week.

406
00:33:09,103 --> 00:33:10,593
Fishing's been better.

407
00:33:10,772 --> 00:33:12,763
Remember when I had that puffer fish?

408
00:33:39,967 --> 00:33:42,128
Just like in gym class.

409
00:33:42,303 --> 00:33:43,964
One hand at a time.

410
00:33:49,477 --> 00:33:51,308
Ellen!

411
00:33:52,146 --> 00:33:53,135
What's that?

412
00:34:03,324 --> 00:34:04,814
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

413
00:34:07,095 --> 00:34:09,086
<i>Sorry, honey, I'll be right up.</i>

414
00:34:14,001 --> 00:34:15,263
This is steep.

415
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:16,762
Here we go.

416
00:34:31,385 --> 00:34:32,374
Need help?

417
00:34:32,453 --> 00:34:33,784
<i>No, I got it.</i>

418
00:34:36,524 --> 00:34:40,119
<i>That's a workout there, isn't it?
Climbed all the way up.</i>

419
00:34:42,029 --> 00:34:43,860
I almost lost my tag.

420
00:34:44,465 --> 00:34:46,797
Drinks at the snacketeria on me.

421
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:17,521
I've noticed you're taking more
of an interest in the fairer sex.

422
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:21,195
There's something
your old dad would like to say.

423
00:35:22,069 --> 00:35:23,229
You see...

424
00:35:23,971 --> 00:35:25,666
there comes a time...

425
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:28,504
in every young man's life when he enters...

426
00:35:28,676 --> 00:35:31,668
the fragrant garden of beautiful flowers.

427
00:35:32,246 --> 00:35:35,579
And he wants to enter that garden
with a knowledge and...

428
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:37,081
a mulch...

429
00:35:37,418 --> 00:35:41,411
<i>to let the flowers bloom
more brightly, rather than...</i>

430
00:35:41,989 --> 00:35:43,013
Dad.

431
00:35:43,124 --> 00:35:44,113
What?

432
00:35:44,192 --> 00:35:46,524
<i>If this is about sex, I already know.</i>

433
00:35:47,361 --> 00:35:48,419
You do?

434
00:35:54,869 --> 00:35:56,097
<i>Good talk, son.</i>

435
00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:00,831
So what's it going to be tonight?
"The Amazing Elvis Monkeys"?

436
00:36:01,008 --> 00:36:02,669
"Liberace on Ice"?

437
00:36:02,844 --> 00:36:06,177
<i>Clark, I don't know.
It's been such a long day.</i>

438
00:36:07,014 --> 00:36:11,951
<i>At Hoover Dam the water /eve/
dropped four feet from a f/ood.</i>

439
00:36:12,186 --> 00:36:13,619
Thank you.

440
00:36:14,522 --> 00:36:16,513
<i>And now back to gamb/ing.</i>

441
00:36:16,791 --> 00:36:18,349
Look at this.

442
00:36:18,626 --> 00:36:20,526
Four tickets to Wayne Newton.

443
00:36:21,295 --> 00:36:22,853
Wayne Newton!

444
00:36:25,399 --> 00:36:26,388
Wayne Newton?

445
00:36:26,467 --> 00:36:29,368
<i>That's Las Vegas, they never stop giving!</i>

446
00:36:29,971 --> 00:36:31,370
<i>Hi, for Ellen Griswold?</i>

447
00:36:31,873 --> 00:36:33,807
I'm Mr. Ellen Griswold.

448
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,711
"Please wear this tonight.

449
00:36:47,889 --> 00:36:49,379
"A friend. "

450
00:36:50,725 --> 00:36:51,987
Who's it from?

451
00:36:52,827 --> 00:36:54,886
I don't know.

452
00:36:55,496 --> 00:36:57,555
But it's beautiful.

453
00:37:00,167 --> 00:37:03,568
They really know how to treat
their high rollers around here.

454
00:37:03,738 --> 00:37:05,069
<i>Okay, kids...</i>

455
00:37:05,239 --> 00:37:07,070
inspection in five minutes.

456
00:37:07,575 --> 00:37:09,668
You heard him! Move it!

457
00:37:13,781 --> 00:37:18,218
Wayne Newton just happens to be
one of America's greatest entertainers.

458
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:20,781
He has an effect on women.

459
00:37:20,955 --> 00:37:23,788
<i>Yes, Griswold, Griswold.
Right this way, sir.</i>

460
00:37:26,294 --> 00:37:27,454
Here...

461
00:37:28,296 --> 00:37:29,957
make the seats good.

462
00:37:34,568 --> 00:37:37,298
<i>No gratuity is necessary, sir.</i>

463
00:37:37,471 --> 00:37:39,803
<i>- No, really. Keep it.
- Follow me.</i>

464
00:37:43,144 --> 00:37:44,577
We're in the front row.

465
00:37:44,745 --> 00:37:45,973
I tipped him.

466
00:37:55,089 --> 00:37:56,647
What energy!

467
00:38:01,996 --> 00:38:03,088
Thank you.

468
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:05,596
You're a magical group of people.

469
00:38:06,267 --> 00:38:07,598
<i>And, Greg...</i>

470
00:38:07,768 --> 00:38:10,430
Give me some birds. Let me hear birds.

471
00:38:57,651 --> 00:38:59,312
Mrs. Ellen Griswold.

472
00:39:00,054 --> 00:39:01,487
<i>Ellen, huh?</i>

473
00:39:02,556 --> 00:39:05,992
<i>Holy crap,
Wayne Newton's hitting on Mom.</i>

474
00:39:06,394 --> 00:39:08,328
It's all part of the act.

475
00:39:08,562 --> 00:39:09,551
Now you.

476
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:28,910
I think we know who sent the dress.

477
00:39:32,019 --> 00:39:33,008
You're lucky.

478
00:39:33,087 --> 00:39:36,181
I've been to every Wayne show
for the last 15 years.

479
00:39:36,357 --> 00:39:39,190
I've never seen him do anything like this.

480
00:39:46,934 --> 00:39:50,700
I'm just saying I've never heard you
hit those notes before.

481
00:39:50,871 --> 00:39:52,099
Don't worry.

482
00:39:52,273 --> 00:39:55,367
You have nothing to fear
from Wayne Newton. He's...

483
00:39:55,543 --> 00:39:56,874
unattainable.

484
00:39:57,211 --> 00:39:58,769
Did you see him staring at...

485
00:39:58,946 --> 00:40:00,106
Watch your mouth.

486
00:40:00,281 --> 00:40:03,045
I think I'll go upstairs and take a bath.

487
00:40:03,217 --> 00:40:04,275
Not me.

488
00:40:05,453 --> 00:40:06,715
Anyone for craps?

489
00:40:06,887 --> 00:40:08,286
<i>We're too young, remember?</i>

490
00:40:11,058 --> 00:40:12,719
I remember when I was too young.

491
00:40:13,394 --> 00:40:14,383
Here.

492
00:40:15,396 --> 00:40:16,624
Take $20.

493
00:40:16,797 --> 00:40:18,059
If you need me...

494
00:40:18,232 --> 00:40:20,962
I'll be rolling the dice.

495
00:40:21,902 --> 00:40:22,891
<i>Have fun, kids.</i>

496
00:40:23,571 --> 00:40:25,402
- Have a nice night.
- See you later.

497
00:40:28,976 --> 00:40:31,570
<i>Daddy wants a seven! Let's go, seven!</i>

498
00:40:31,745 --> 00:40:34,145
Seven! A winner!

499
00:40:34,315 --> 00:40:37,148
Place your bets. Lucky roller coming out.

500
00:40:37,318 --> 00:40:38,478
Place your bets.

501
00:40:41,789 --> 00:40:44,952
Let go of me! Let go of me!

502
00:40:45,726 --> 00:40:47,216
There he is. Clark!

503
00:40:47,561 --> 00:40:49,222
<i>See, I told you.</i>

504
00:40:49,663 --> 00:40:51,824
<i>Look out, don't hurt me now.</i>

505
00:40:52,333 --> 00:40:54,324
Nice place for a pearl necklace.

506
00:40:54,602 --> 00:40:56,092
Do you know this person?

507
00:40:56,270 --> 00:40:58,602
<i>Hi, Clark Griswold. Nice to meet you.</i>

508
00:41:00,174 --> 00:41:02,267
Have you ever swam with dolphins?

509
00:41:02,476 --> 00:41:04,910
Them things is hard to catch.

510
00:41:05,079 --> 00:41:07,809
Twelve. Craps. A loser.

511
00:41:08,015 --> 00:41:10,279
Has anyone ever told you before...

512
00:41:11,185 --> 00:41:12,277
you're bad luck?

513
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:15,811
Those were my mother's dying words.

514
00:41:15,990 --> 00:41:19,426
But when you got your body
covered in third-degree burns...

515
00:41:19,593 --> 00:41:22,494
<i>and your foot's in a bear trap,
you start talking crazy.</i>

516
00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:32,605
I've run out of money.
Do you cash checks?

517
00:41:32,773 --> 00:41:34,934
Only if you're staying at the hotel.

518
00:41:35,109 --> 00:41:36,337
Indeed I am.

519
00:41:37,444 --> 00:41:39,173
There we are.

520
00:41:45,186 --> 00:41:46,778
No problem.

521
00:41:54,695 --> 00:41:55,957
Good luck.

522
00:41:56,130 --> 00:41:58,291
<i>Look, Clark, if you're...</i>

523
00:41:58,465 --> 00:42:01,696
<i>thinking about buying me
a Cadillac, forget it.</i>

524
00:42:01,835 --> 00:42:02,824
I won't take it.

525
00:42:02,903 --> 00:42:04,393
I'm just trying to get even.

526
00:42:04,905 --> 00:42:07,169
Now where can I do the most damage?

527
00:42:13,981 --> 00:42:15,881
<i>Shrimp cocktail, 29 cents.</i>

528
00:42:18,519 --> 00:42:19,508
Foxy boxing.

529
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:21,483
Fake IDs.

530
00:42:21,889 --> 00:42:22,913
How'd you know?

531
00:42:22,990 --> 00:42:26,551
When I was your age they needed
a water cannon to keep me away...

532
00:42:26,727 --> 00:42:28,490
from the girls down at the Paramount.

533
00:42:28,662 --> 00:42:30,562
$10. $10! $10!

534
00:42:30,731 --> 00:42:32,062
<i>Shrimp, ladies.</i>

535
00:42:32,233 --> 00:42:33,723
I need the $10.

536
00:42:35,002 --> 00:42:36,333
Here.

537
00:42:36,904 --> 00:42:38,895
<i>Have a good evening, Mr. Morris.</i>

538
00:42:41,108 --> 00:42:42,097
Whatever.

539
00:42:42,176 --> 00:42:44,576
- Another 21!
- You nailed her there.

540
00:42:45,579 --> 00:42:48,104
<i>Let's see. House has 14, and house busts.</i>

541
00:42:48,515 --> 00:42:50,176
<i>Oh, boy!</i>

542
00:42:50,351 --> 00:42:52,080
<i>Wendy, you are my lucky charm.</i>

543
00:42:52,353 --> 00:42:54,844
I don't know what's wrong
with me tonight.

544
00:42:56,023 --> 00:42:57,354
You're rolling.

545
00:42:57,691 --> 00:42:59,522
<i>Good luck, everybody.</i>

546
00:43:02,429 --> 00:43:03,691
<i>Good luck, everybody!</i>

547
00:43:04,698 --> 00:43:05,858
Batter up.

548
00:43:08,936 --> 00:43:11,427
Big bet for a big man!

549
00:43:12,206 --> 00:43:14,936
Sure you don't want to save money
for the buffet?

550
00:43:15,042 --> 00:43:16,031
<i>Okay, wise guy.</i>

551
00:43:16,110 --> 00:43:17,771
Go against three hands.

552
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:22,438
This should be sweet.

553
00:43:22,716 --> 00:43:24,946
Sweet for me. You're finished.

554
00:43:29,723 --> 00:43:30,951
Straw.

555
00:43:32,393 --> 00:43:33,883
I'm trying to concentrate.

556
00:43:36,563 --> 00:43:39,225
That's a bigger fire than the red drink.

557
00:43:47,408 --> 00:43:49,808
Did you come to Las Vegas
to be a showgirl?

558
00:43:50,311 --> 00:43:52,745
<i>No, I'm on vacation with my parents.</i>

559
00:43:55,449 --> 00:43:58,179
<i>Hard to believe we're related, right?</i>

560
00:44:08,696 --> 00:44:09,788
<i>A drink, please.</i>

561
00:44:09,963 --> 00:44:12,022
Welcome. Can I see some ID?

562
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:22,967
I think we have a problem.

563
00:44:28,549 --> 00:44:29,709
Good night.

564
00:44:35,322 --> 00:44:36,983
<i>Hey, why the long face?</i>

565
00:44:37,157 --> 00:44:39,990
You know that crap ID you sold me?
I want my $10 back.

566
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:41,991
Those bums threw you out?

567
00:44:42,563 --> 00:44:45,657
Helicopter rides to the Grand Canyon.
See it as God does.

568
00:44:45,833 --> 00:44:46,993
They tossed me.

569
00:44:49,002 --> 00:44:51,163
Don't they realize what it's like to be:

570
00:44:54,174 --> 00:44:55,402
Give me my money.

571
00:44:55,576 --> 00:44:57,908
I'm not through with you yet. Okay?

572
00:44:58,245 --> 00:45:02,739
<i>You're Nick Pappagiorgio. You're from
Yuma, Arizona. You're into software.</i>

573
00:45:02,916 --> 00:45:05,510
Put your head in the hole
and say "Joey Heatherton. "

574
00:45:05,686 --> 00:45:08,177
<i>- Right here on the Strip?
- Smile, kid.</i>

575
00:45:08,355 --> 00:45:09,344
You're in Vegas!

576
00:45:29,410 --> 00:45:33,073
So you guys have been together
longer than the real Beatles?

577
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:34,238
Great.

578
00:45:34,415 --> 00:45:35,746
Will you excuse me?

579
00:45:43,090 --> 00:45:45,081
You want to dance up here?

580
00:45:45,259 --> 00:45:47,022
<i>No, I don't think so.</i>

581
00:45:47,594 --> 00:45:50,358
<i>Audrey, honey, let me tell you
something I learned.</i>

582
00:45:50,531 --> 00:45:54,365
<i>In this world, you're either
up on stage in the spotlight...</i>

583
00:45:54,535 --> 00:45:56,696
or down in the pit serving drinks.

584
00:45:56,870 --> 00:45:58,269
Go have fun.

585
00:46:25,632 --> 00:46:27,463
What are you doing up there?

586
00:46:28,302 --> 00:46:30,634
I'm starting my vacation!

587
00:46:34,141 --> 00:46:36,473
She's going to break hearts.

588
00:46:36,810 --> 00:46:38,801
She's going to break something.

589
00:47:17,451 --> 00:47:18,850
Congratulations.

590
00:47:19,019 --> 00:47:20,179
You won the car.

591
00:47:21,355 --> 00:47:22,788
May I see some ID?

592
00:47:29,530 --> 00:47:32,294
<i>Where would you like the car sent,
Mr. Pappagiorgio?</i>

593
00:47:39,306 --> 00:47:40,295
Eighteen.

594
00:47:41,808 --> 00:47:42,797
Nineteen.

595
00:47:42,976 --> 00:47:44,204
So close.

596
00:47:47,047 --> 00:47:49,641
I've had enough. Let's get out of here.

597
00:47:50,384 --> 00:47:52,045
<i>Good luck, sir.</i>

598
00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:57,213
Never seen such a beating since
someone stuck a banana in my pants...

599
00:47:57,391 --> 00:47:58,483
and turned a monkey loose.

600
00:47:58,659 --> 00:48:00,388
Thanks for the pick-me-up.

601
00:48:00,561 --> 00:48:03,655
Why don't you just call it a night
and let Ellen lick your wounds?

602
00:48:03,830 --> 00:48:07,231
<i>That sounds great,
but Ellen went to sleep hours ago.</i>

603
00:48:07,401 --> 00:48:09,995
She must be one hell of a sleepwalker.

604
00:48:12,239 --> 00:48:14,173
Did you record that in Germany?

605
00:48:15,409 --> 00:48:16,740
<i>Good night, Eddie.</i>

606
00:48:17,711 --> 00:48:20,202
That's how they got
the title "Danke Schön. "

607
00:48:20,380 --> 00:48:21,608
It means "thank you. "

608
00:48:21,882 --> 00:48:23,440
"Thank you" in German.

609
00:48:27,955 --> 00:48:29,616
I thought you went to bed.

610
00:48:29,790 --> 00:48:31,883
It got late. I got worried.

611
00:48:32,059 --> 00:48:33,617
<i>Clark, Wayne Newton.</i>

612
00:48:34,227 --> 00:48:35,216
Nice to meet you.

613
00:48:35,395 --> 00:48:38,057
You're in food preservatives? What a gas.

614
00:48:40,233 --> 00:48:41,723
I like it.

615
00:48:41,902 --> 00:48:43,301
As I was saying...

616
00:48:43,470 --> 00:48:45,563
You've traveled. We never go anywhere.

617
00:48:45,739 --> 00:48:50,142
We're very boring. Usually Clark falls
asleep in front of the TV each night.

618
00:48:50,310 --> 00:48:53,404
I guess I'll go upstairs and get some sleep.

619
00:48:54,915 --> 00:48:57,816
Let me just tip the piano player.
She was marvelous.

620
00:48:58,051 --> 00:49:01,111
I might have... I've got a chip here.

621
00:49:04,391 --> 00:49:05,380
<i>Danke schön.</i>

622
00:49:06,627 --> 00:49:07,616
Thanks.

623
00:49:07,761 --> 00:49:08,989
Sit down.

624
00:49:11,999 --> 00:49:13,660
Very special lady.

625
00:49:14,434 --> 00:49:17,926
That's why I entered into the sacred bond
of marriage with her.

626
00:49:18,672 --> 00:49:20,003
I hear that.

627
00:49:20,941 --> 00:49:23,171
<i>You know, I love women.</i>

628
00:49:23,343 --> 00:49:25,436
I observe them.

629
00:49:25,612 --> 00:49:27,273
I cherish them.

630
00:49:29,483 --> 00:49:31,474
Don't let that one out of your sight.

631
00:49:40,827 --> 00:49:44,923
Wayne has invited us to Shenandoah
tomorrow for lunch.

632
00:49:45,098 --> 00:49:46,087
That's my home.

633
00:49:46,266 --> 00:49:47,255
Thank you.

634
00:49:47,434 --> 00:49:49,095
But we have a lot of plans.

635
00:49:49,269 --> 00:49:50,258
Don't we?

636
00:49:53,507 --> 00:49:55,771
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

637
00:49:55,942 --> 00:49:58,172
It's Wayne Newton!

638
00:49:59,846 --> 00:50:01,677
<i>I'm a fan, sir.</i>

639
00:50:01,848 --> 00:50:02,837
I'm a fan.

640
00:50:03,016 --> 00:50:04,506
I can believe it!

641
00:50:04,685 --> 00:50:06,676
<i>Take my seat, Eddie.</i>

642
00:50:08,288 --> 00:50:10,188
Thank you for the drink.

643
00:50:10,357 --> 00:50:11,790
<i>Good night, Wayne.</i>

644
00:50:18,865 --> 00:50:20,457
Do you need a bodyguard?

645
00:50:20,634 --> 00:50:22,033
I'd die for you.

646
00:50:29,543 --> 00:50:32,307
<i>Could I play $5 in coins, please?</i>

647
00:50:32,579 --> 00:50:34,513
I'd like to bet $5.

648
00:50:34,748 --> 00:50:35,840
$5.

649
00:50:36,016 --> 00:50:37,005
New roller.

650
00:50:37,184 --> 00:50:39,345
Looks like a shooter. I'm going for it.

651
00:50:39,519 --> 00:50:42,181
- Go for this. Go for this.
- I'm ready.

652
00:50:42,355 --> 00:50:43,344
Come on!

653
00:50:44,191 --> 00:50:45,590
<i>Seven, now!</i>

654
00:50:45,759 --> 00:50:47,021
Seven! A winner.

655
00:50:48,228 --> 00:50:49,217
Way to go!

656
00:50:51,398 --> 00:50:52,387
Press it?

657
00:50:52,566 --> 00:50:53,555
Press it?

658
00:50:53,667 --> 00:50:54,998
I want to press this up.

659
00:50:55,168 --> 00:50:56,100
Press it.

660
00:50:56,169 --> 00:50:57,500
<i>Yeah, press it.</i>

661
00:50:57,671 --> 00:50:59,832
Give him the dice. Come on.

662
00:51:02,342 --> 00:51:03,331
<i>Seven, dice!</i>

663
00:51:04,344 --> 00:51:05,402
Winner.

664
00:51:05,779 --> 00:51:06,768
Fantastic!

665
00:51:06,847 --> 00:51:08,007
He's great!

666
00:51:09,015 --> 00:51:11,677
<i>I'm sorry to bother you, sir.
May I see some ID?</i>

667
00:51:12,686 --> 00:51:14,347
ID? Sure.

668
00:51:16,857 --> 00:51:17,846
Thank you.

669
00:51:22,195 --> 00:51:25,255
<i>Welcome to the Mirage, Mr. Pappagiorgio.</i>

670
00:51:25,432 --> 00:51:28,094
Why do they do that
when we got a hot table?

671
00:51:29,269 --> 00:51:30,429
How's Yuma?

672
00:51:30,604 --> 00:51:31,593
It's great.

673
00:51:31,705 --> 00:51:36,108
<i>My wife and kids are back in Yuma,
where I work in software...</i>

674
00:51:36,276 --> 00:51:37,766
In the software business.

675
00:51:37,944 --> 00:51:39,878
Let him roll the dice.

676
00:51:42,282 --> 00:51:43,442
No glasses tonight?

677
00:51:45,118 --> 00:51:46,779
<i>No, I do not require them.</i>

678
00:51:48,221 --> 00:51:49,449
<i>Good luck, sir.</i>

679
00:51:51,458 --> 00:51:52,618
But you do.

680
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:54,221
- Come on!
- Seven!

681
00:51:54,394 --> 00:51:58,057
Seven again! Seven again!
I can't believe it!

682
00:52:01,902 --> 00:52:03,733
Don't wake them.

683
00:52:11,578 --> 00:52:15,412
<i>Forget craps, forget b/ackjack.
/f you want to make money...</i>

684
00:52:16,650 --> 00:52:20,484
<i>wa/k up to a baccarat tab/e and say,
"/ want to p/ay baccarat. "</i>

685
00:52:21,822 --> 00:52:23,915
<i>Feeling lucky tonight, Sparky?</i>

686
00:52:24,090 --> 00:52:27,651
<i>Not right now, honey.
They're teaching me baccarat.</i>

687
00:52:28,762 --> 00:52:30,320
Bet with the player.

688
00:52:32,432 --> 00:52:35,094
That's not exactly what I had in mind.

689
00:52:35,268 --> 00:52:38,601
Bet with the bank. Bet with the player.

690
00:52:39,172 --> 00:52:40,935
Nine is a natural.

691
00:52:41,107 --> 00:52:42,506
Bet with the bank.

692
00:52:42,676 --> 00:52:45,770
Bet with the player. Nine is a natural.

693
00:52:47,614 --> 00:52:49,275
Bet with the bank.

694
00:52:49,449 --> 00:52:50,848
Bet with the player.

695
00:52:51,017 --> 00:52:52,348
Nine is a natural.

696
00:52:53,353 --> 00:52:55,116
Bet with the bank.

697
00:52:55,288 --> 00:52:56,687
Eight is a winner.

698
00:52:57,958 --> 00:52:59,016
Give me that.

699
00:52:59,192 --> 00:53:01,854
Should we really be doing this
before we get married?

700
00:53:04,297 --> 00:53:06,026
Hard six coming out.

701
00:53:07,133 --> 00:53:08,361
Hit me.

702
00:53:09,703 --> 00:53:10,965
Good night.

703
00:53:15,709 --> 00:53:16,869
Do it again!

704
00:53:17,043 --> 00:53:18,374
Do it again!

705
00:53:18,545 --> 00:53:19,978
I'm coming out. Ready?

706
00:53:22,182 --> 00:53:23,171
Seven out.

707
00:53:23,483 --> 00:53:24,711
God!

708
00:53:26,820 --> 00:53:27,878
Nice roll.

709
00:53:28,221 --> 00:53:29,381
You did good.

710
00:53:30,724 --> 00:53:31,713
Thank you.

711
00:53:31,892 --> 00:53:33,154
Cash me in.

712
00:53:35,996 --> 00:53:38,988
<i>Kid, you made me a lot of money tonight.</i>

713
00:53:39,666 --> 00:53:40,655
Jilly from Philly.

714
00:53:40,734 --> 00:53:42,497
Nick Pappagiorgio from Yuma.

715
00:53:42,669 --> 00:53:45,570
<i>Nick Pappagiorgio from Yuma,
you like getting massaged?</i>

716
00:53:46,006 --> 00:53:46,995
By who?

717
00:53:47,073 --> 00:53:48,165
By me!

718
00:53:48,341 --> 00:53:50,832
Meet us in the spa at 10:00
tomorrow morning.

719
00:53:51,011 --> 00:53:53,912
<i>Randy, this guy is with us.
You take care of him.</i>

720
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:57,846
We're so impressed with your play
we'd like you to stay here.

721
00:53:58,018 --> 00:53:59,076
Follow me.

722
00:54:02,355 --> 00:54:06,416
<i>And if there's anything you need,
don't hesitate to call me.</i>

723
00:54:06,927 --> 00:54:08,189
Thank you!

724
00:54:40,226 --> 00:54:41,557
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

725
00:54:48,101 --> 00:54:50,194
<i>Card counting, Clark?</i>

726
00:54:50,770 --> 00:54:51,862
Is that legal?

727
00:54:52,372 --> 00:54:53,862
Sharpens the player's edge.

728
00:54:56,376 --> 00:54:57,707
Here are the kids.

729
00:54:58,511 --> 00:55:00,843
What happened to you last night?

730
00:55:02,415 --> 00:55:04,906
What are you having for breakfast?

731
00:55:05,018 --> 00:55:05,950
Coffee.

732
00:55:06,019 --> 00:55:06,951
Three.

733
00:55:07,020 --> 00:55:07,952
Four.

734
00:55:08,021 --> 00:55:10,421
<i>- Gang!
- Don't shout, Daddy.</i>

735
00:55:10,590 --> 00:55:14,424
I had an idea. How about an "alone" day...

736
00:55:14,594 --> 00:55:18,587
where each of us Griswolds
goes out and explores Las Vegas...

737
00:55:18,765 --> 00:55:19,925
in their own way?

738
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:22,759
I don't think that's a good idea.

739
00:55:22,936 --> 00:55:24,198
- Great.
- Love you.

740
00:55:24,371 --> 00:55:25,929
Be back at 5:00.

741
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:29,203
You'll have a great time.

742
00:55:29,376 --> 00:55:30,365
Have fun.

743
00:56:03,510 --> 00:56:05,171
Payback time.

744
00:56:10,784 --> 00:56:12,684
$500.

745
00:56:13,453 --> 00:56:15,444
You don't know when to quit.

746
00:56:15,789 --> 00:56:16,778
Chips.

747
00:56:16,856 --> 00:56:18,790
Changing $500!

748
00:56:23,029 --> 00:56:24,519
Here's an idea.

749
00:56:24,697 --> 00:56:28,963
<i>You give me half the money
you're going to bet, we go out back...</i>

750
00:56:29,135 --> 00:56:32,036
I'll kick you in the nuts
and we'll call it a day?

751
00:56:39,646 --> 00:56:41,136
Pappagiorgio...

752
00:56:41,314 --> 00:56:42,645
enjoying the massage?

753
00:56:42,882 --> 00:56:45,146
<i>I'm enjoying it, Jilly. Really.</i>

754
00:56:45,318 --> 00:56:48,549
You know what your problem is?
You're a nervous guy.

755
00:56:49,389 --> 00:56:51,380
You must learn how to relax.

756
00:56:51,558 --> 00:56:53,719
<i>You're right, Jilly, I do.</i>

757
00:56:54,227 --> 00:56:55,888
Harder on the shoulders.

758
00:56:56,062 --> 00:56:57,893
<i>That's it, kid.</i>

759
00:56:58,064 --> 00:57:01,556
<i>Not that you got that,
we must teach you how to dress.</i>

760
00:57:07,173 --> 00:57:09,903
Now aren't you a little slice of pie?

761
00:57:10,076 --> 00:57:11,907
Are you thinking of dancing?

762
00:57:12,912 --> 00:57:14,573
She's got a body for it.

763
00:57:14,747 --> 00:57:16,180
I do? Thanks.

764
00:57:16,349 --> 00:57:19,182
<i>If you're considering it,
do it while you're young and foolish.</i>

765
00:57:19,252 --> 00:57:22,915
I'm going to college but hoping to do
volunteer work in the summer.

766
00:57:23,089 --> 00:57:25,353
Our prime years are few and fast.

767
00:57:25,525 --> 00:57:27,186
<i>Would've, could've, should've.</i>

768
00:57:28,428 --> 00:57:30,862
Show this girl something with a heel.

769
00:57:34,434 --> 00:57:35,423
Hit me!

770
00:57:36,903 --> 00:57:38,234
Yeah! Twenty!

771
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:43,600
It's 20. It's a push.

772
00:57:44,043 --> 00:57:45,101
I didn't lose.

773
00:57:45,778 --> 00:57:49,544
<i>That's it, Griswold, you are freaking dead!</i>

774
00:57:50,216 --> 00:57:52,207
<i>I love you, kid.</i>

775
00:58:25,151 --> 00:58:27,483
Outrageous. Where's the family?

776
00:58:28,087 --> 00:58:29,418
They're busy.

777
00:58:30,990 --> 00:58:33,652
Did I come at a bad time? Because...

778
00:58:33,826 --> 00:58:35,157
I could just...

779
00:58:35,328 --> 00:58:39,765
A singer's body is his instrument and
I believe in keeping it finely tuned.

780
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:42,830
<i>Come in, let's have some fun.</i>

781
00:58:48,441 --> 00:58:49,601
Blackjack.

782
00:58:49,776 --> 00:58:51,107
Blackjack.

783
00:58:51,844 --> 00:58:53,277
Six.

784
00:59:10,363 --> 00:59:11,955
They're not bad.

785
00:59:12,465 --> 00:59:17,368
<i>The boys aren't much to talk to, but if
you need a night away from your cat...</i>

786
00:59:17,537 --> 00:59:19,630
they're more than fine.

787
00:59:58,411 --> 00:59:59,901
What did you say?

788
01:00:00,246 --> 01:00:02,908
<i>I said, "Blackjack!"</i>

789
01:00:09,756 --> 01:00:11,849
<i>Changing $1,600!</i>

790
01:00:14,761 --> 01:00:16,194
Lunch was wonderful.

791
01:00:16,362 --> 01:00:18,592
I hope you enjoyed the company
as much as the food.

792
01:00:20,867 --> 01:00:23,199
<i>Please, madam, chin up.</i>

793
01:00:24,771 --> 01:00:25,863
You know...

794
01:00:26,039 --> 01:00:29,600
I've always felt very blessed
by all the gifts I've been given.

795
01:00:31,044 --> 01:00:34,104
But after meeting you
I realize how truly alone I am.

796
01:00:35,214 --> 01:00:38,206
<i>But, Wayne, you have millions of fans.</i>

797
01:00:38,551 --> 01:00:39,779
Please.

798
01:00:39,952 --> 01:00:41,544
They just love my talent.

799
01:00:42,055 --> 01:00:44,888
I feel so many things right now.

800
01:00:45,124 --> 01:00:47,115
I wish I could spend my life with you.

801
01:00:49,228 --> 01:00:50,559
Well...

802
01:00:50,897 --> 01:00:55,459
<i>we could turn the den into a guest room,
but what about your horses?</i>

803
01:00:55,635 --> 01:00:59,071
Clark pretty much likes the garage
for the car and the lawn mowers.

804
01:01:05,411 --> 01:01:07,140
You're too much.

805
01:01:08,247 --> 01:01:10,078
I have something for you.

806
01:01:20,593 --> 01:01:22,083
It's a lock of my hair.

807
01:01:25,098 --> 01:01:26,429
Gosh!

808
01:01:27,934 --> 01:01:29,834
It's getting late!

809
01:01:30,837 --> 01:01:32,270
I've got to go!

810
01:01:32,438 --> 01:01:33,996
But thank you.

811
01:01:35,441 --> 01:01:36,669
- It's been wonderful.
- Wait.

812
01:01:38,111 --> 01:01:41,103
<i>If you have nothing to do later,
please come back!</i>

813
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:42,941
I'm making pasta!

814
01:01:48,020 --> 01:01:51,251
<i>Come on, you think this sign's here
to hold down the table?</i>

815
01:01:54,293 --> 01:01:55,692
What can I do with $5?

816
01:01:56,362 --> 01:01:57,795
I don't know.

817
01:01:58,197 --> 01:02:00,859
Buy a bullet and rent a gun?

818
01:02:07,340 --> 01:02:08,432
See you.

819
01:02:08,608 --> 01:02:09,597
Have a good time.

820
01:02:19,118 --> 01:02:20,676
<i>Good luck, sir.</i>

821
01:02:21,788 --> 01:02:25,349
I had a fantastic "alone" day.
It was a great idea.

822
01:02:26,292 --> 01:02:27,691
Where'd you get that stuff?

823
01:02:27,860 --> 01:02:29,794
At the men's store. Ask for Caesar.

824
01:02:31,464 --> 01:02:32,396
My God!

825
01:02:32,465 --> 01:02:34,296
Vickie took me to her stylist.

826
01:02:35,535 --> 01:02:38,971
Did you know there were 92 muscles
in the human throat?

827
01:02:39,939 --> 01:02:42,908
All this time I thought I was
unhappy with you and Mom.

828
01:02:42,975 --> 01:02:47,309
<i>But I was dissatisfied with myself.
That's changed, thanks to Las Vegas!</i>

829
01:02:47,713 --> 01:02:51,479
<i>This is Larry, Kurt and Ira.
They're professional entertainers.</i>

830
01:02:51,717 --> 01:02:52,706
Nice to meet you.

831
01:02:53,152 --> 01:02:54,551
You know what drives me crazy?

832
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:56,210
The baccarat tables.

833
01:02:56,389 --> 01:02:59,654
Larry can bend his leg up
over his head. Want to see?

834
01:02:59,725 --> 01:03:00,692
You should.

835
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:01,749
It's after-riding wear.

836
01:03:01,828 --> 01:03:05,161
<i>If those guys weren't bust-outs,
you think they'd be home writing?</i>

837
01:03:05,331 --> 01:03:06,821
Come with me!

838
01:03:06,999 --> 01:03:07,988
Not you!

839
01:03:15,308 --> 01:03:18,607
I know we haven't seen a lot
of each other lately and that's okay...

840
01:03:18,678 --> 01:03:20,168
but we're Griswolds.

841
01:03:20,346 --> 01:03:22,007
We're on vacation.

842
01:03:22,181 --> 01:03:25,241
<i>And starting now, we're going
to have a great time.</i>

843
01:03:25,518 --> 01:03:27,577
<i>But, Dad, we're having a great time.</i>

844
01:03:27,753 --> 01:03:30,244
My sister has the legs of a thoroughbred.

845
01:03:30,456 --> 01:03:31,445
Am I right?

846
01:03:31,524 --> 01:03:32,513
Shut up.

847
01:03:33,025 --> 01:03:35,186
<i>The point is, starting now...</i>

848
01:03:35,361 --> 01:03:37,761
we'll have a great time together!

849
01:03:37,930 --> 01:03:38,919
How?

850
01:03:39,932 --> 01:03:41,092
How?

851
01:03:41,267 --> 01:03:42,427
Well...

852
01:03:42,635 --> 01:03:43,795
How?

853
01:03:47,139 --> 01:03:48,629
We could all...

854
01:03:48,808 --> 01:03:51,299
<i>sit on a bench, as a family...</i>

855
01:03:51,477 --> 01:03:55,140
and watch a Vegas sunset.
Wouldn't that be great?

856
01:04:00,253 --> 01:04:03,745
<i>We could count the bulbs
on the Strip, Audrey.</i>

857
01:04:04,390 --> 01:04:07,382
Larry's taking me to see
the world's largest thermometer.

858
01:04:10,062 --> 01:04:12,121
I got a thing happening downtown.

859
01:04:14,066 --> 01:04:15,556
<i>I mean, you know...</i>

860
01:04:21,073 --> 01:04:22,301
I know.

861
01:04:23,476 --> 01:04:26,240
We can get remarried. Right now.

862
01:04:26,412 --> 01:04:30,473
There's a honeymoon slots tournament
over at the Golden Nugget. And guess?

863
01:04:30,650 --> 01:04:33,141
Newlyweds get in for free.

864
01:04:33,819 --> 01:04:35,912
<i>I've got news for you, Clark.</i>

865
01:04:36,155 --> 01:04:37,918
I haven't said "yes" yet.

866
01:04:42,161 --> 01:04:43,423
If you're too busy...

867
01:04:43,596 --> 01:04:45,496
You hang on a minute!

868
01:04:45,665 --> 01:04:47,929
You brought us on a family vacation...

869
01:04:48,100 --> 01:04:51,934
and we only see you on your way
in or out of the casino!

870
01:04:52,104 --> 01:04:53,093
I've invited you...

871
01:04:53,272 --> 01:04:55,672
You find the Clark Griswold I married...

872
01:04:55,841 --> 01:04:58,435
and tell him I'm at the Mirage!

873
01:04:58,611 --> 01:04:59,600
Come on.

874
01:05:01,948 --> 01:05:06,112
Don't worry about me! I got plenty
I can do on my own in Las Vegas!

875
01:05:15,227 --> 01:05:16,626
<i>Which hand is it in?</i>

876
01:05:19,198 --> 01:05:21,530
Who wants it now? Who wants it?

877
01:05:21,734 --> 01:05:23,668
<i>There you go, you heathens!</i>

878
01:05:24,370 --> 01:05:26,361
Thanks for buying me dinner.

879
01:05:26,539 --> 01:05:29,372
<i>Best $1.49 buffet in town, Clark.</i>

880
01:05:29,642 --> 01:05:32,372
<i>Clark, this is all you can eat.</i>

881
01:05:32,545 --> 01:05:34,376
We only need one plate.

882
01:05:44,190 --> 01:05:45,680
Get me some rolls.

883
01:05:45,858 --> 01:05:47,519
I had that last time. That's good.

884
01:05:47,693 --> 01:05:48,853
Fresh broccoli.

885
01:05:50,696 --> 01:05:51,685
Bless you.

886
01:05:51,764 --> 01:05:52,924
Thank you.

887
01:05:53,099 --> 01:05:56,262
Maybe I'll just replace these
and take a carrot.

888
01:05:56,435 --> 01:05:58,096
How about some macaroni?

889
01:05:58,437 --> 01:06:01,031
- That's good.
- Let's get a little more.

890
01:06:02,942 --> 01:06:05,103
Some of this spaghetti bolognese here.

891
01:06:05,878 --> 01:06:08,369
You're lucky you came on Italian night.

892
01:06:09,448 --> 01:06:10,437
That stuff...

893
01:06:10,783 --> 01:06:12,774
will knock your socks off.

894
01:06:12,952 --> 01:06:14,943
This doesn't look like chicken.

895
01:06:15,287 --> 01:06:16,948
<i>Oh, you're right.</i>

896
01:06:17,123 --> 01:06:19,887
This isn't chicken. This is chicken.

897
01:06:20,059 --> 01:06:21,219
Want some?

898
01:06:22,228 --> 01:06:25,288
<i>Eddie, I think I'll just be over
by the Saltines.</i>

899
01:06:25,464 --> 01:06:27,796
<i>- Here, go ahead.
- Go get us a table.</i>

900
01:06:29,902 --> 01:06:32,063
We'll have some...

901
01:06:32,238 --> 01:06:33,637
of the yellow.

902
01:06:34,807 --> 01:06:37,241
And don't get cheap on me.

903
01:06:44,984 --> 01:06:47,817
This bread pudding's extra runny tonight.

904
01:06:47,987 --> 01:06:51,320
<i>Eddie, when you look at me,
what do you see?</i>

905
01:06:58,764 --> 01:07:00,425
<i>Time's up, Eddie.</i>

906
01:07:01,467 --> 01:07:03,128
I'll tell you what you see.

907
01:07:03,402 --> 01:07:04,664
You see a man...

908
01:07:04,770 --> 01:07:08,672
whose family counted on him
to give them the best vacation ever.

909
01:07:09,175 --> 01:07:11,609
And I can't do it. Because...

910
01:07:13,612 --> 01:07:15,341
You have something on your...

911
01:07:18,350 --> 01:07:19,282
I get it?

912
01:07:19,351 --> 01:07:20,579
You got it.

913
01:07:22,388 --> 01:07:25,050
I've gambled away more money
than you'll ever understand.

914
01:07:25,891 --> 01:07:27,051
Try me.

915
01:07:32,531 --> 01:07:34,465
<i>$22,600.</i>

916
01:07:34,633 --> 01:07:35,622
God!

917
01:07:36,202 --> 01:07:37,294
<i>Oh, God!</i>

918
01:07:37,470 --> 01:07:38,869
<i>Oh, God!</i>

919
01:07:39,305 --> 01:07:40,863
<i>Oh, God!</i>

920
01:07:42,875 --> 01:07:44,206
<i>- Oh, God!
- Please!</i>

921
01:07:49,548 --> 01:07:51,812
I don't know what to tell Ellen.

922
01:07:53,686 --> 01:07:57,452
<i>If I could just get that money back,
I could turn it all around.</i>

923
01:07:59,792 --> 01:08:03,694
You've been so good to Catherine
and me through the years.

924
01:08:03,863 --> 01:08:05,524
I hate to see you down.

925
01:08:06,298 --> 01:08:07,856
I've got some...

926
01:08:20,546 --> 01:08:22,810
money stashed away and...

927
01:08:23,482 --> 01:08:27,646
it'd be my honor to help you
in your time of need.

928
01:08:28,721 --> 01:08:29,983
You mean it?

929
01:08:31,157 --> 01:08:32,886
There's just one problem.

930
01:08:34,059 --> 01:08:36,220
I forgot where I buried it.

931
01:08:38,564 --> 01:08:40,725
Is it safe to be digging like this?

932
01:08:41,834 --> 01:08:43,893
Just watch out for the scorpions.

933
01:08:52,845 --> 01:08:55,405
I got money buried all over this yard.

934
01:08:57,249 --> 01:09:00,184
I used to have quite a little system
for finding it.

935
01:09:00,352 --> 01:09:02,183
<i>Wait, here's something.</i>

936
01:09:05,057 --> 01:09:06,046
$28!

937
01:09:08,828 --> 01:09:09,817
Got one.

938
01:09:09,895 --> 01:09:11,294
Got one. Got one.

939
01:09:16,135 --> 01:09:17,124
$6.

940
01:09:17,303 --> 01:09:21,239
Yuban coffee. You can sprinkle
that stuff on anything.

941
01:09:21,407 --> 01:09:25,810
<i>Ice cream, mashed potatoes, or eat it
right out of the can for a pick-me-up.</i>

942
01:09:28,314 --> 01:09:29,804
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

943
01:09:30,316 --> 01:09:32,648
There must be over $100 in here.

944
01:09:33,485 --> 01:09:36,579
<i>Yeah, that's from when I sold
one of my kidneys.</i>

945
01:09:36,822 --> 01:09:39,313
<i>We didn't need the cash at the time, but...</i>

946
01:09:39,491 --> 01:09:42,255
I figured with all the advances
in modern medicine...

947
01:09:42,428 --> 01:09:45,659
I should sell it while somebody
still wanted to buy it.

948
01:09:45,931 --> 01:09:47,592
The smartest thing I ever did.

949
01:09:48,767 --> 01:09:51,497
Why do you have all this money
buried in the ground?

950
01:09:52,605 --> 01:09:54,596
For a rainy day.

951
01:09:55,341 --> 01:09:57,832
We don't get many of those in the desert.

952
01:10:02,948 --> 01:10:04,677
Where's the nearest casino?

953
01:10:05,284 --> 01:10:07,115
<i>Hello, room service.</i>

954
01:10:07,286 --> 01:10:09,618
I'd like the Crab Rangoon...

955
01:10:09,955 --> 01:10:11,616
chicken fingers...

956
01:10:12,124 --> 01:10:14,024
the Jackpot Burger...

957
01:10:15,027 --> 01:10:17,518
and the Tropical Banana Torte.

958
01:10:20,199 --> 01:10:21,188
No.

959
01:10:21,634 --> 01:10:23,124
Cancel that.

960
01:10:23,469 --> 01:10:24,959
I'm going out.

961
01:10:25,471 --> 01:10:26,961
I must warn you.

962
01:10:27,139 --> 01:10:31,633
They don't play the same games here
as at them regular casinos.

963
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:36,539
<i>Eddie, this place is great.</i>

964
01:10:37,149 --> 01:10:39,049
They don't play this at the Mirage.

965
01:10:39,885 --> 01:10:42,149
Pick a number? I'm great at that.

966
01:10:42,721 --> 01:10:44,154
Coin toss?

967
01:10:44,323 --> 01:10:45,654
These are my games.

968
01:10:45,824 --> 01:10:47,155
Give me $20.

969
01:10:47,326 --> 01:10:48,384
War!

970
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:51,154
Russ and I play this all the time.

971
01:10:51,897 --> 01:10:52,886
I'm in.

972
01:10:52,998 --> 01:10:54,226
Here we go.

973
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:55,728
Mine.

974
01:10:56,235 --> 01:10:57,827
That's fast.

975
01:10:58,003 --> 01:10:59,334
Give me another $20.

976
01:11:02,041 --> 01:11:03,030
<i>War, bet again.</i>

977
01:11:07,913 --> 01:11:09,175
Mine again.

978
01:11:09,515 --> 01:11:12,075
Maybe you should spread it around...

979
01:11:12,351 --> 01:11:14,581
not have all your fun at one table.

980
01:11:19,925 --> 01:11:22,189
Dealer has rock. Pay paper.

981
01:11:25,431 --> 01:11:26,420
Call it.

982
01:11:26,532 --> 01:11:29,933
What say we go home and
bury what's left of my money?

983
01:11:30,102 --> 01:11:31,091
Heads.

984
01:11:32,271 --> 01:11:34,034
<i>I'm sorry, it's tails.</i>

985
01:11:34,606 --> 01:11:36,039
Almost.

986
01:11:46,785 --> 01:11:49,777
<i>No, give me that! Give me that!</i>

987
01:11:49,955 --> 01:11:52,947
<i>He cheated, Eddie!
He switched them, I saw it!</i>

988
01:12:08,340 --> 01:12:10,001
- Four.
- Seven.

989
01:12:13,145 --> 01:12:14,806
What am I doing?

990
01:12:16,148 --> 01:12:18,742
I need to go someplace
where a man can think.

991
01:12:19,585 --> 01:12:21,246
I wouldn't do that here.

992
01:12:21,420 --> 01:12:24,981
These stalls are awfully dirty
and they're backed up.

993
01:12:26,425 --> 01:12:28,086
I need to be alone.

994
01:12:30,496 --> 01:12:31,827
I see.

995
01:12:31,997 --> 01:12:33,089
Want me to come?

996
01:12:34,833 --> 01:12:36,425
All right. Come on.

997
01:12:39,138 --> 01:12:40,537
<i>Come on, Clark.</i>

998
01:12:40,706 --> 01:12:44,972
The night is young. They're giving away
free sandwiches at the blood bank.

999
01:12:45,144 --> 01:12:47,374
I'm not worthy of a sandwich.

1000
01:12:47,546 --> 01:12:50,538
<i>I'm not a father, I'm not a husband,
I'm nothing!</i>

1001
01:12:50,716 --> 01:12:54,152
<i>You may feel like nothing now,
but look on the bright side.</i>

1002
01:12:54,319 --> 01:12:57,880
You used to be something.
Nobody can take that away from you.

1003
01:12:59,491 --> 01:13:00,822
<i>Good-bye, Ellen.</i>

1004
01:13:01,326 --> 01:13:04,159
I'm sure you'll be happy
with Wayne Newton.

1005
01:13:05,397 --> 01:13:07,058
Where am I going to go?

1006
01:13:07,232 --> 01:13:09,894
You can live with us right here in Vegas.

1007
01:13:10,069 --> 01:13:11,559
We'll dig you a room.

1008
01:13:11,737 --> 01:13:13,830
And Rusty and poor Audrey...

1009
01:13:14,006 --> 01:13:16,338
At night you can sit outside...

1010
01:13:16,508 --> 01:13:19,671
and you can tell us how much
more good you used to have it.

1011
01:13:19,912 --> 01:13:22,745
Look at all these happy families.

1012
01:13:23,415 --> 01:13:25,076
Where did I go wrong?

1013
01:13:29,354 --> 01:13:32,016
<i>Without my family,
there is no Clark Griswold.</i>

1014
01:13:32,191 --> 01:13:34,091
We can go into business.

1015
01:13:34,259 --> 01:13:36,921
<i>We can raise more snakes,
open a petting zoo.</i>

1016
01:13:37,096 --> 01:13:39,087
<i>Yeah, that's what we could do.</i>

1017
01:13:39,264 --> 01:13:42,199
<i>We could have a lot of happy,
wonderful times.</i>

1018
01:13:42,534 --> 01:13:44,365
We'll get your money back.

1019
01:13:46,772 --> 01:13:48,763
I'm not worried about my money.

1020
01:13:49,374 --> 01:13:51,205
I don't care about it.

1021
01:13:52,277 --> 01:13:53,767
I must get my family back!

1022
01:13:54,446 --> 01:13:56,107
What about my money?

1023
01:13:56,281 --> 01:13:58,112
<i>Stay here, I'll be back.</i>

1024
01:14:00,219 --> 01:14:01,550
Police emergency.

1025
01:14:06,625 --> 01:14:08,058
Open up!

1026
01:14:09,661 --> 01:14:11,322
<i>Don't be alarmed, he's with me.</i>

1027
01:14:17,769 --> 01:14:19,327
<i>Say, "Cheese. "</i>

1028
01:14:30,015 --> 01:14:31,949
It's Dean Martin's recipe.

1029
01:14:32,117 --> 01:14:34,017
I always make too much.

1030
01:14:34,453 --> 01:14:36,785
Thank you for having me for dinner.

1031
01:14:39,191 --> 01:14:41,182
There's something I must tell you.

1032
01:14:42,861 --> 01:14:43,850
<i>Oh, no.</i>

1033
01:14:45,197 --> 01:14:46,630
<i>Wayne, please, don't.</i>

1034
01:14:46,865 --> 01:14:49,299
I've always been a moral man.

1035
01:14:50,536 --> 01:14:54,302
But my resolve is melting
in the light of your smile.

1036
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:57,040
Maybe you're hungry. More pasta?

1037
01:14:57,209 --> 01:14:58,198
There's Treasure Island.

1038
01:14:58,310 --> 01:15:00,369
There's Harrah's. There's the Mirage.

1039
01:15:00,546 --> 01:15:01,706
<i>Next, Wayne Newton's house.</i>

1040
01:15:04,883 --> 01:15:06,475
<i>Wayne, please.</i>

1041
01:15:07,553 --> 01:15:08,542
Please.

1042
01:15:17,396 --> 01:15:19,330
<i>Don't worry, I'm here.</i>

1043
01:15:19,498 --> 01:15:20,897
Get out of my way.

1044
01:15:21,166 --> 01:15:23,066
Hands off my wife!

1045
01:15:27,072 --> 01:15:29,506
<i>Clark, it's not the way it looks.</i>

1046
01:15:29,675 --> 01:15:31,074
We're having pasta.

1047
01:15:32,144 --> 01:15:33,133
I've been a fool.

1048
01:15:33,245 --> 01:15:37,511
And not a loveable fool who clowns
for the delight of children.

1049
01:15:38,417 --> 01:15:40,009
But a fool who's...

1050
01:15:40,252 --> 01:15:41,913
only fooling himself.

1051
01:15:44,590 --> 01:15:45,750
You're back.

1052
01:15:45,924 --> 01:15:48,586
You have got to be kidding me.

1053
01:15:48,760 --> 01:15:51,024
Why don't you go sing something?

1054
01:15:52,197 --> 01:15:55,360
I've learned that
a family vacation only works...

1055
01:15:55,534 --> 01:15:59,026
when you're with your family.
You and Russ and...

1056
01:15:59,204 --> 01:16:00,262
Audrey.

1057
01:16:00,439 --> 01:16:01,599
Audrey.

1058
01:16:01,773 --> 01:16:02,933
You're my family.

1059
01:16:03,709 --> 01:16:08,373
The most important thing is for us
to get back together before it's too late.

1060
01:16:09,081 --> 01:16:10,070
What do you say?

1061
01:16:10,749 --> 01:16:11,909
I'm with you.

1062
01:16:12,584 --> 01:16:13,608
Let's go get our kids.

1063
01:16:20,359 --> 01:16:21,849
<i>- Is there a charge?
- No, sir.</i>

1064
01:16:22,027 --> 01:16:23,016
Park it.

1065
01:16:28,033 --> 01:16:29,523
Have you seen him?

1066
01:16:29,701 --> 01:16:30,861
Mr. Pappagiorgio.

1067
01:16:31,036 --> 01:16:33,368
- Lanai Six.
- He's my son.

1068
01:16:33,605 --> 01:16:35,698
Mr. Pappagiorgio?

1069
01:16:36,208 --> 01:16:37,607
Let's go.

1070
01:16:38,110 --> 01:16:40,544
<i>Oh, boy. Oh, boy.</i>

1071
01:16:46,785 --> 01:16:48,275
<i>Clark, do something.</i>

1072
01:16:48,453 --> 01:16:49,442
Look out!

1073
01:16:59,798 --> 01:17:02,562
<i>Oh, my little baby boy!</i>

1074
01:17:03,235 --> 01:17:05,795
Excuse me. Excuse me!

1075
01:17:14,813 --> 01:17:15,973
Am I right?

1076
01:17:16,448 --> 01:17:17,437
Am I?

1077
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:24,421
<i>So I says to him, I said,
"Get your own monkey. "</i>

1078
01:17:24,589 --> 01:17:26,921
<i>Oh, my Lord! Rusty!</i>

1079
01:17:27,659 --> 01:17:30,150
You must be lost.
This is Mr. Pappagiorgio.

1080
01:17:30,329 --> 01:17:33,321
<i>His name is not Pappagiorgio,
he's Rusty Griswold!</i>

1081
01:17:33,498 --> 01:17:35,659
<i>He's a C-plus student.
Now, out of the pool!</i>

1082
01:17:35,834 --> 01:17:37,267
<i>Let's go, young man!</i>

1083
01:17:37,436 --> 01:17:39,267
Now! Get dressed!

1084
01:17:43,775 --> 01:17:46,608
I'm looking for this underage kid
named Pappagiorgio.

1085
01:17:46,778 --> 01:17:49,440
<i>Yes, he stole my wallet. He's back there.</i>

1086
01:17:51,450 --> 01:17:52,439
Where's your sister?

1087
01:17:52,517 --> 01:17:54,610
She's with Vickie somewhere.

1088
01:17:54,786 --> 01:17:56,014
Where's Vickie?

1089
01:18:09,201 --> 01:18:12,034
<i>- Mr. Pappagiorgio, your usual table?
- Not tonight.</i>

1090
01:18:12,204 --> 01:18:14,195
<i>You are in deep trouble, my friend.</i>

1091
01:18:15,040 --> 01:18:16,473
Excuse me.

1092
01:18:26,318 --> 01:18:28,149
<i>Hey, everybody!</i>

1093
01:18:28,320 --> 01:18:29,719
Where's Audrey?

1094
01:18:33,158 --> 01:18:34,489
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

1095
01:18:37,829 --> 01:18:39,057
Our baby!

1096
01:18:39,231 --> 01:18:41,995
<i>Hang on, honey,
Daddy's coming to get you!</i>

1097
01:18:44,236 --> 01:18:45,225
Move!

1098
01:18:46,004 --> 01:18:47,733
What do you think you're doing?

1099
01:18:47,906 --> 01:18:50,238
You told me to get a summer job!

1100
01:18:50,509 --> 01:18:53,910
Ten years of tap-dancing lessons
and this is how you repay me?

1101
01:18:54,079 --> 01:18:55,569
Let's go!

1102
01:18:55,747 --> 01:18:58,238
Excuse me! Excuse me!

1103
01:18:58,917 --> 01:19:00,680
<i>Come on, let's go.</i>

1104
01:19:11,062 --> 01:19:14,259
I don't know what I was thinking.
Let's go home now.

1105
01:19:14,366 --> 01:19:15,424
When are we going?

1106
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:17,693
Let's quit while we're ahead.

1107
01:19:17,869 --> 01:19:20,269
<i>Ahead or behind, what does it matter?</i>

1108
01:19:21,039 --> 01:19:22,939
We still have each other.

1109
01:19:25,277 --> 01:19:28,371
<i>When we get home,
even though I've lost most of our money...</i>

1110
01:19:28,547 --> 01:19:29,775
Wait a minute.

1111
01:19:30,115 --> 01:19:32,447
"I've lost most of our money"?

1112
01:19:33,218 --> 01:19:35,118
How much did you lose?

1113
01:19:35,954 --> 01:19:38,388
<i>Well, with the checks
and the credit cards...</i>

1114
01:19:38,557 --> 01:19:41,788
some trips to the ATM
and the plane tickets I cashed in...

1115
01:19:42,294 --> 01:19:43,283
I don't know...

1116
01:19:43,562 --> 01:19:46,963
<i>$22,000, $23,000.</i>

1117
01:19:47,132 --> 01:19:48,121
Somewhere in there.

1118
01:19:48,733 --> 01:19:50,223
What about my tuition?

1119
01:19:50,402 --> 01:19:51,562
And my snowboard?

1120
01:19:51,736 --> 01:19:53,397
We still have our love.

1121
01:19:54,806 --> 01:19:57,070
That's what I've come to realize.

1122
01:19:57,242 --> 01:20:00,734
<i>Clark, how much money
do you have right now?</i>

1123
01:20:03,081 --> 01:20:04,070
I'm broke.

1124
01:20:05,317 --> 01:20:06,249
Rusty?

1125
01:20:06,318 --> 01:20:09,412
I spent it all.
Having an entourage is expensive.

1126
01:20:09,754 --> 01:20:10,914
Audrey?

1127
01:20:11,089 --> 01:20:12,579
No pockets.

1128
01:20:15,494 --> 01:20:17,155
I've got...

1129
01:20:18,663 --> 01:20:19,652
$2.

1130
01:20:23,101 --> 01:20:25,001
Get our money back.

1131
01:20:30,842 --> 01:20:31,934
There.

1132
01:20:35,847 --> 01:20:38,111
This is not the way to do this.

1133
01:20:38,283 --> 01:20:41,013
Can't we just get your parents
to wire us some money?

1134
01:20:43,288 --> 01:20:47,019
<i>Oh, keno. This is easy. I saw this on TV.</i>

1135
01:20:54,132 --> 01:20:56,965
<i>Okay, you've got to pick ten numbers.</i>

1136
01:20:57,202 --> 01:20:59,864
<i>We must play the kids' birthdays.
Sixteen, seven.</i>

1137
01:21:00,038 --> 01:21:01,801
<i>And Dad's football number, 44.</i>

1138
01:21:10,148 --> 01:21:12,639
<i>Excuse me, is that your family?</i>

1139
01:21:14,219 --> 01:21:15,208
You're a lucky man.

1140
01:21:15,654 --> 01:21:17,315
Luckiest guy on earth.

1141
01:21:18,390 --> 01:21:19,880
The grandparents' anniversary.

1142
01:21:21,660 --> 01:21:22,820
I never got married.

1143
01:21:22,994 --> 01:21:24,859
I was afraid to take the risk.

1144
01:21:25,931 --> 01:21:27,023
Beautiful children.

1145
01:21:27,933 --> 01:21:30,868
<i>Oh, thank you. We're very blessed.</i>

1146
01:21:31,603 --> 01:21:33,537
<i>This thing is money, money.</i>

1147
01:21:33,705 --> 01:21:35,195
Let me tell you something.

1148
01:21:35,373 --> 01:21:36,465
Money isn't everything.

1149
01:21:37,409 --> 01:21:39,001
I sit here alone...

1150
01:21:39,210 --> 01:21:40,199
nobody cares.

1151
01:21:40,445 --> 01:21:43,437
<i>If I win, I have nobody to share it with.</i>

1152
01:21:46,217 --> 01:21:47,775
You have your health.

1153
01:21:47,953 --> 01:21:49,614
It seems like you have a hobby.

1154
01:21:49,788 --> 01:21:52,279
<i>Yeah, a hobby I got. My health?</i>

1155
01:21:53,391 --> 01:21:55,791
<i>If I had a family, I'd want it like yours.</i>

1156
01:22:00,065 --> 01:22:02,966
<i>Tonight, consider yourself
part of our family.</i>

1157
01:22:04,803 --> 01:22:05,963
I'll take you up on it.

1158
01:22:07,238 --> 01:22:08,967
<i>Really, thank you.</i>

1159
01:22:09,040 --> 01:22:10,064
Nice of you.

1160
01:22:10,141 --> 01:22:11,165
Good luck.

1161
01:22:11,409 --> 01:22:12,967
The game's almost starting.

1162
01:22:17,382 --> 01:22:18,371
<i>Seven.</i>

1163
01:22:19,050 --> 01:22:20,278
It's seven.

1164
01:22:20,452 --> 01:22:22,386
It's Audrey's birthday!

1165
01:22:22,787 --> 01:22:24,550
We're going to do it!

1166
01:22:24,723 --> 01:22:25,951
<i>Ten.</i>

1167
01:22:30,295 --> 01:22:31,284
<i>Fourteen.</i>

1168
01:22:32,297 --> 01:22:33,286
Doesn't matter.

1169
01:22:33,632 --> 01:22:36,567
<i>Even eight matches wins $15,500.</i>

1170
01:22:37,068 --> 01:22:38,296
<i>Twenty-two.</i>

1171
01:22:41,072 --> 01:22:42,130
<i>Thirty-three.</i>

1172
01:22:45,910 --> 01:22:46,899
<i>Eighty.</i>

1173
01:23:01,159 --> 01:23:02,990
<i>Your fina/ number, 54.</i>

1174
01:23:12,837 --> 01:23:13,929
I won!

1175
01:23:14,105 --> 01:23:15,868
I won! I won!

1176
01:23:16,474 --> 01:23:17,634
I won!

1177
01:23:19,477 --> 01:23:20,808
I won!

1178
01:23:20,979 --> 01:23:22,037
I won!

1179
01:23:22,947 --> 01:23:26,713
All the years I've waited for this!
I've been coming in here for years!

1180
01:23:26,885 --> 01:23:30,377
<i>I've never won, never won once,
and now I won!</i>

1181
01:23:30,555 --> 01:23:35,219
<i>The money is mine. I have the money,
the money is mine. I got it!</i>

1182
01:23:35,393 --> 01:23:38,658
<i>For the first time, I have the...</i>

1183
01:23:45,904 --> 01:23:47,064
Sir...

1184
01:23:47,572 --> 01:23:48,561
are you okay?

1185
01:23:53,578 --> 01:23:55,239
Go get someone.

1186
01:23:57,849 --> 01:23:58,838
Sir.

1187
01:24:03,088 --> 01:24:04,419
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

1188
01:24:05,190 --> 01:24:06,248
I won!

1189
01:24:06,424 --> 01:24:08,915
I won the money! I won!

1190
01:24:09,260 --> 01:24:10,591
Did you hear me?

1191
01:24:10,662 --> 01:24:12,653
<i>It's okay. It's here, right here.</i>

1192
01:24:12,831 --> 01:24:15,391
<i>1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9...</i>

1193
01:24:15,900 --> 01:24:17,492
That's wonderful.

1194
01:24:21,506 --> 01:24:22,905
That's wonderful.

1195
01:25:00,779 --> 01:25:02,110
What did he say?

1196
01:25:02,947 --> 01:25:04,437
<i>He said, "Take the ticket. "</i>

1197
01:25:06,551 --> 01:25:08,951
<i>He said, "Take the ticket"?</i>

1198
01:25:09,287 --> 01:25:10,879
I think he did.

1199
01:25:19,297 --> 01:25:20,559
He's gone.

1200
01:25:20,965 --> 01:25:22,398
There was nothing you could do.

1201
01:25:22,967 --> 01:25:24,298
We don't know his name.

1202
01:25:24,569 --> 01:25:28,232
He was Mr. Ellis.
The loneliest guy I ever saw.

1203
01:25:28,406 --> 01:25:32,069
He would've given anything to have
someone sit with him and be kind.

1204
01:25:44,322 --> 01:25:45,755
Jeez.

1205
01:26:20,358 --> 01:26:24,624
I hope you kids have learned something
about the dangers of gambling.

1206
01:26:24,829 --> 01:26:27,229
<i>No, Sparklet, don't blame the gambling.</i>

1207
01:26:27,498 --> 01:26:29,830
Gambling is what made America great.

1208
01:26:30,068 --> 01:26:31,399
<i>You see, kids...</i>

1209
01:26:31,836 --> 01:26:35,738
when Columbus set sail
on a little rickety boat...

1210
01:26:35,907 --> 01:26:40,344
<i>and let it ride all the way
to the New World, it was a gamble.</i>

1211
01:26:40,912 --> 01:26:42,573
<i>Ben Franklin, Thomas Edison...</i>

1212
01:26:43,181 --> 01:26:45,172
<i>Albert Einstein, all gamblers.</i>

1213
01:26:45,516 --> 01:26:46,915
Wasn't Einstein German?

1214
01:26:47,185 --> 01:26:48,914
Hard to tell from his accent.

1215
01:26:49,354 --> 01:26:51,015
But I do know one thing.

1216
01:26:51,422 --> 01:26:53,856
<i>When a beautiful, young coed...</i>

1217
01:26:54,025 --> 01:26:57,358
took a chance on a gangly boy
of a man named Clark...

1218
01:26:57,929 --> 01:27:00,090
<i>she was taking a gamble, too.</i>

1219
01:27:06,371 --> 01:27:09,363
Ellen Priscilla Ruth Smith Griswold...

1220
01:27:13,778 --> 01:27:16,212
will you remarry me?

1221
01:27:29,127 --> 01:27:32,096
<i>Ellen Griswold, do you promise
to love and honor Clark...</i>

1222
01:27:32,163 --> 01:27:33,721
for as long as you live?

1223
01:27:35,800 --> 01:27:37,563
<i>Oh, God!</i>

1224
01:27:41,005 --> 01:27:41,994
I do.

1225
01:27:42,073 --> 01:27:44,132
Clark Griswold...

1226
01:27:44,409 --> 01:27:46,969
<i>I love you, Eddie.</i>

1227
01:27:49,247 --> 01:27:53,240
Do you promise to love and honor Ellen
for as long as you both shall live?

1228
01:27:53,918 --> 01:27:54,907
I do.

1229
01:27:55,053 --> 01:27:59,114
<i>I don't care if you ruined my life,
I love you!</i>

1230
01:27:59,924 --> 01:28:02,256
By the power vested in me...

1231
01:28:02,427 --> 01:28:07,160
<i>by the Las Vegas Entertainers'
Association, I pronounce you married.</i>

1232
01:28:07,332 --> 01:28:08,924
You may kiss the bride.
