1
00:01:14,641 --> 00:01:17,235
<i>I can't hear you.</i>

2
00:01:17,277 --> 00:01:20,144
<i>It's them bells!</i>

3
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:23,007
<i>I've had them in my</i>
<i>ears for ten hours.</i>

4
00:01:23,117 --> 00:01:26,443
<i>Ding, dong, ding, dong.</i>

5
00:01:27,887 --> 00:01:30,549
<i> Hey, sergeant.</i>
<i>Where's Major Lance?</i>

6
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:33,559
<i> We moved the CP back to</i>
<i>that stone building. The major's there.</i>

7
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:35,356
<i> Get him,</i>
<i>the colonel's here.</i>

8
00:01:36,963 --> 00:01:38,624
<i>Hold it!</i>

9
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:51,241
<i> Colonel! Am I glad to see you!</i>

10
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:55,475
<i> Those bodies...</i>
<i>Get those bodies down!</i>

11
00:01:55,515 --> 00:01:59,212
- <i>What are you doing? Get 'em down!</i>
- <i>Of course. Yes, sir.</i>

12
00:01:59,252 --> 00:02:02,415
- <i>We've been under fire...</i>
- <i>I know you have, but I don't care!</i>

13
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:07,154
<i>Get 'em down! Down!</i>
<i>Don't want those boys left up there.</i>

14
00:02:07,193 --> 00:02:11,254
<i>We're gonna hold this town till</i>
<i>the linkup does come, whenever it is.</i>

15
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:16,291
<i>Today, tomorrow,</i>
<i>till hell freezes over.</i>

16
00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:18,463
<i>For their sake,</i>
<i>if for no other reason.</i>

17
00:02:18,505 --> 00:02:21,201
- <i> Private?</i>
- <i> Yes, sir.</i>

18
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:24,369
- <i> It's a hell of a war.</i>
- <i> A privilege to serve with you.</i>

19
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:29,040
<i>Well, God willing, we'll do</i>
<i>what we came here to do.</i>

20
00:02:29,082 --> 00:02:32,779
- <i>Ready, sir.</i>
- <i>Move out!</i>

21
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:40,115
Pilgrim, we fought
for this country, too.

22
00:02:43,062 --> 00:02:44,825
Five postcard stamps, please.

23
00:02:46,399 --> 00:02:49,095
- Thank you. Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

24
00:02:49,135 --> 00:02:51,626
Thank you so much.
Have a Merry Christmas.

25
00:02:53,306 --> 00:02:55,274
Airmail to Kingston, Jamaica.

26
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:02,041
Stamps only?

27
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:09,512
Twenty-cent stamp, please.

28
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:17,826
Excuse me, sir?
Twenty-cent stamp, please.

29
00:03:28,441 --> 00:03:30,033
- Rodolfo.
- You.

30
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:13,385
- Hey, buddy.
- Um, press.

31
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:15,011
OK.

32
00:04:21,794 --> 00:04:24,786
- Are you Detective Ricci?
- That's my story.

33
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:26,059
I heard about you.

34
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:28,966
Yeah, well,
you oughta change friends then.

35
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:31,903
I'm Tim Boyle. <i>Daily News.</i>

36
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:34,873
- What happened?
- Read about it in the <i>New York Post.</i>

37
00:04:34,907 --> 00:04:38,809
They left here two hours ago along with
<i>The Times, Newsday</i> and every channel

38
00:04:38,845 --> 00:04:42,804
you can get on TV with a wire hanger.
Ain't you ever heard of the early bird?

39
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:45,716
- Christ.
- Go find a wailing wall.

40
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:47,686
- I got lost.
- Comin' here?

41
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,779
Find another way
for a dollar to change pockets.

42
00:04:49,822 --> 00:04:53,223
- It's my first day as a reporter.
- It's probably your last.

43
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:55,921
Welcome to New York.
Be like Governor Rockefeller:

44
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:58,658
- Come and go at the same time.
- Give me some angle.

45
00:04:58,698 --> 00:05:01,758
All I can give you
is an empty feeling, kid.

46
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:04,929
The perp's over at Bellevue,
eighth floor peanut gallery.

47
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:07,405
The victim's deader
than yesterday's beer.

48
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,034
Heard he wasn't special
when he was breathing.

49
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:13,534
My next job's gonna be stuffin'
ballot boxes on Staten Island.

50
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:18,175
Remind me to vote. I live there.
Most cops do. Go home, kid.

51
00:05:18,217 --> 00:05:20,082
- Don't stop for bread.
- Come on.

52
00:05:20,119 --> 00:05:23,555
Gotta be something I can work.
Can I give you a tip on a hot horse?

53
00:05:23,589 --> 00:05:26,353
I'll play Santa at the PA
on Christmas Day. Or I'll...

54
00:05:26,392 --> 00:05:30,385
I'll pay Hong Kong Sue over on Forty
Deuce to blow your noodle like Satchmo.

55
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,557
How about I put a story
in your hip pocket?

56
00:05:32,598 --> 00:05:34,691
"Good Cop Helps Poor Kids."

57
00:05:34,734 --> 00:05:38,465
Honest to Jesus, you get three months
of Saturdays out of it. Come on.

58
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:40,972
I can't go back to scratching out obits.

59
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:45,034
See those guys?
Don't turn around.

60
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:49,174
They're rolling up to Harlem
to sniff around the perp's apartment.

61
00:05:49,215 --> 00:05:53,151
Only case that dynamic duo has cracked
has Schaefer written on the side,

62
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:56,849
but maybe you'll see something.
Don't quote those gumflappers.

63
00:05:56,889 --> 00:05:58,720
- You need a quote, you call me.
- OK.

64
00:05:58,758 --> 00:06:01,249
- Haggerty, Dillard!
- Yeah, what's up?

65
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:05,321
- Take this guy uptown with you.
- Thank you. Thank you.

66
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:07,890
- Come on.
- All right.

67
00:06:19,178 --> 00:06:22,238
We'll start in the living room
and work our way back.

68
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:26,510
Close the door behind you, kid.

69
00:06:49,108 --> 00:06:51,440
This perp is very, very religious.

70
00:06:51,477 --> 00:06:54,913
Nothing wrong with being
in good standing with the Lord.

71
00:06:59,852 --> 00:07:02,377
And a war hero, too.
Look at this, a Purple Heart.

72
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:05,482
Hey, Keith, the Brown Bomber.

73
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:09,359
Muhammad Ali would've knocked
him out. Way too fast for Joe Louis.

74
00:07:09,395 --> 00:07:11,295
He can run, but he can't hide.

75
00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:25,203
Hey, Dan, what the hell is this?

76
00:07:25,244 --> 00:07:28,805
- What you got there?
- I don't know. It's heavy.

77
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:32,807
Whatever this is, it ain't junior-grade.
This thing looks expensive.

78
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:38,620
My wife claws around flea markets
looking for this crap every weekend.

79
00:07:38,658 --> 00:07:40,523
I'm telling you, this ain't normal.

80
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,255
This definitely ain't normal.

81
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:45,162
- Back up, buddy.
- Sorry.

82
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:46,722
No problem.

83
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:49,564
- Professor Brooks?
- Yes.

84
00:07:51,737 --> 00:07:56,572
I get a lot of these things.
Old rocks. Antique specials.

85
00:07:56,609 --> 00:07:59,510
It seems like every
schmuck in the world

86
00:07:59,545 --> 00:08:03,572
who finds a backyard arrowhead
mistakes me for Iris.

87
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:05,049
Put it here.

88
00:08:05,084 --> 00:08:09,748
From Greek mythology.
She is the faithful voice of Zeus.

89
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:14,453
She flies from place to place
and commands respect

90
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:17,895
from mortals and from im...

91
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:21,426
...immortals.

92
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:26,964
- Where the hell'd you get this?
- From a perp's apartment.

93
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:29,270
- It's got this mark...
- Don't touch it.

94
00:08:29,308 --> 00:08:35,008
This is over 450 years old.

95
00:08:35,047 --> 00:08:38,847
It's the missing Primavera
from the Santa Trinita.

96
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:41,353
Is that the <i>Niña,</i> the <i>Pinta</i>
or the <i>Santa Maria?</i>

97
00:08:41,387 --> 00:08:43,446
Oh, for God sakes, detective.

98
00:08:43,489 --> 00:08:46,481
It's the oldest elliptic

99
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:49,893
arch bridge in the world.

100
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:53,456
It's in Florence, Italy.

101
00:08:53,499 --> 00:08:55,763
Built by Ammanati.

102
00:08:55,801 --> 00:08:59,202
This was one of four statues on it.

103
00:08:59,238 --> 00:09:04,073
The Primavera, meaning "spring."

104
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:05,941
This head has been missing

105
00:09:05,978 --> 00:09:10,608
since the Nazis blew up
the bridge in 1944.

106
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:15,883
My God! This is a gold mine!

107
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:18,680
A gold mine!

108
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:24,820
Yo!

109
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:47,482
Merry Christmas. From Tim Boyle.

110
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,613
Oh, wise guy.

111
00:10:18,417 --> 00:10:20,612
Mr. Hector Negron?

112
00:10:55,054 --> 00:10:57,454
Darling, come back to bed.

113
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,980
Please. Enough.

114
00:10:59,025 --> 00:11:01,687
I need a little break, OK, baby?

115
00:11:07,199 --> 00:11:10,100
They say you haven't
spoken or eaten in two days.

116
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:13,162
They'll try to force-feed you.

117
00:11:13,205 --> 00:11:15,503
Make you rise, like Jesus.

118
00:11:21,981 --> 00:11:24,950
Come on. I've hiked all over
New York asking about you.

119
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:27,782
I talked to everybody.
Cops, your sister.

120
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:31,381
Spoke to your cousin in San Juan.
You're clean as a board of health.

121
00:11:31,424 --> 00:11:34,086
You got no kids, no debts, no enemies.

122
00:11:34,126 --> 00:11:36,253
Four years in the service. Purple Heart.

123
00:11:36,295 --> 00:11:38,661
Twenty-five years
of a great marriage,

124
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:41,963
till your wife's heart gave out.

125
00:11:43,569 --> 00:11:47,562
So why you stick a German Luger
in a guy's chest

126
00:11:47,606 --> 00:11:51,940
three months short of your retirement?
Five million dollars.

127
00:11:51,977 --> 00:11:54,946
That's how much that head would
draw on the black market.

128
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:58,677
What's it doin' buried there
on the bottom of your closet?

129
00:12:06,525 --> 00:12:08,925
You're looking at 25 to life, pal.

130
00:12:08,961 --> 00:12:12,453
Unless you can afford a lawyer,
you're gonna swallow happy pills

131
00:12:12,498 --> 00:12:15,296
in this nuthouse the rest of your life.

132
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:20,101
But my story could help you.
And you need help, mac.

133
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:29,106
Enrico, what kind
of art dealer specializes in Nazi art?

134
00:12:29,148 --> 00:12:31,981
Because it's a lucrative business.

135
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:37,189
You Americans love work
more than you love 'love.'

136
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:42,794
My love,
are you ignoring me?

137
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,394
Pina, no.
Don't come over here.

138
00:12:49,668 --> 00:12:52,102
Enrico, you said
you only needed ten minutes.

139
00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:55,005
I gotta catch up. World might've
ended, I wouldn't know

140
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,237
'cause we've been going at it
two days. For crying out loud.

141
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:00,245
The world is still here.

142
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:01,610
You and I are still here.

143
00:13:01,647 --> 00:13:03,342
Baby, not right now.

144
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,975
There you go. Excuse me.

145
00:13:08,154 --> 00:13:09,621
OK?

146
00:13:11,924 --> 00:13:14,654
Oh, God. Oh, that feels good.

147
00:13:19,698 --> 00:13:21,165
You're killing me, baby.

148
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,361
Yes, I love you to death.

149
00:14:15,554 --> 00:14:17,454
I...

150
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:21,883
Hmm? What is it, Mr. Negron?

151
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,130
I... I know.

152
00:14:27,766 --> 00:14:28,892
You know what?

153
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,400
I know who the sleeping man is!

154
00:14:37,443 --> 00:14:41,846
- You know what?
- I know who the sleeping man is.

155
00:15:47,913 --> 00:15:51,940
Mama. I want mama.

156
00:16:15,274 --> 00:16:18,710
Kill me now! Kill me now,
I wanna go home to my mama!

157
00:16:18,744 --> 00:16:22,111
I don't wanna be here.
I wanna go home!

158
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:25,378
Kill me now! Kill me now!

159
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:29,547
Oh, Jesus, I want my mama!
I don't wanna die! I don't wanna die!

160
00:16:29,588 --> 00:16:30,680
Shh!

161
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:34,386
- Hector, shut him the fuck up.
- Yes, sir.

162
00:16:34,426 --> 00:16:37,418
- I don't wanna die!
- Shut the fuck up!

163
00:16:37,463 --> 00:16:42,230
You wanna get us all
killed? That's your mama right now.

164
00:16:42,267 --> 00:16:45,361
- This far enough?
- Keep movin'.

165
00:16:45,404 --> 00:16:50,637
- You doin' fine, big fella.
- Help me, Lord. Help me, Lord.

166
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:53,474
Help me, Lord,
I'm prepared for Thee.

167
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:56,879
- Get off of me, sniper bait!
- Bishop, Train, switch flanks.

168
00:16:56,915 --> 00:16:59,247
Bishop, take outer.
Train, take the inner.

169
00:16:59,284 --> 00:17:01,081
- What's that?
- Take inner flank.

170
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,680
- What's that?
- Come on. Switch places, dummy.

171
00:17:03,722 --> 00:17:05,212
Gimme some room.

172
00:17:09,161 --> 00:17:12,324
Hey, Bishop.
Why we got to cross this river?

173
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:14,628
They sellin' hoecakes
and beer on the other side.

174
00:17:18,804 --> 00:17:22,262
- My good luck charm gives me strength.
- Piece of shit you found

175
00:17:22,307 --> 00:17:24,468
in the gutter in Florence?

176
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:27,502
Couldn't draw a bowl of turtle soup
from Uncle Amos with that.

177
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:28,911
Worth more than a bowl of soup!

178
00:17:28,947 --> 00:17:30,847
Shh!

179
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,851
Train.

180
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:36,753
Hector, you speak Italian.
Cut-off head worth somethin'?

181
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:39,724
- <i>Yo</i> speaky Puerto Rican, man.
- Hey, muzzle that.

182
00:17:39,758 --> 00:17:41,225
Keep moving.

183
00:18:53,198 --> 00:18:56,895
<i> Germany calling,</i>
<i>Germany calling.</i>

184
00:18:56,935 --> 00:18:59,768
<i>Guten morgen,</i> 92nd Division.

185
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:03,707
Buffalo soldiers, welcome to the war.

186
00:19:03,742 --> 00:19:07,508
<i>We've been waiting for you.</i>

187
00:19:07,546 --> 00:19:11,676
<i>Do you know our German</i> Wehrmacht
<i>has been here digging bunkers</i>

188
00:19:11,717 --> 00:19:15,619
<i>for six months on the Gothic Line?</i>
<i>Waiting.</i>

189
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:20,591
<i>Your white commanders</i>
<i>won't tell you that, of course.</i>

190
00:19:20,626 --> 00:19:25,620
<i>Why? Because they</i>
<i>don't care if you die.</i>

191
00:19:26,765 --> 00:19:30,292
<i>But the German people have</i>
<i>nothing against the Negro.</i>

192
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:34,271
That's why I'm warning you now,
with all my heart and soul.

193
00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:36,968
Save yourself, Negro brothers.

194
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:40,308
<i>Why die for a nation</i>
<i>that doesn't want you?</i>

195
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:44,645
<i>A nation that treats you like a slave.</i>

196
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:46,150
<i>Did I say slave?</i>

197
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:48,983
Yes, I did.

198
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:52,286
Why don't they shut her up?

199
00:19:52,324 --> 00:19:54,155
What is she saying?

200
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:57,219
Berlin can afford to pipe
that garbage all the way here

201
00:19:57,262 --> 00:19:59,321
but can't give us potato soup.

202
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:04,427
Individual guns only, on my command.

203
00:20:06,171 --> 00:20:09,629
We have enough ammo
for an hour, maybe two.

204
00:20:09,675 --> 00:20:11,870
<i> Look around you.</i>

205
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:15,846
<i>Do you see any white soldiers</i>
<i>in the river next to you?</i>

206
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:20,477
<i>Are they sending any white</i>
<i>soldiers to die with you today?</i>

207
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:23,579
- <i>Of course not!</i>
- Steady, ya'll. Adolf Hitler.

208
00:20:23,622 --> 00:20:26,614
Spreadin' that nonsense.
Don't believe a word of that!

209
00:20:26,658 --> 00:20:30,253
Lyin' bastard thinks we monkeys,
apes, baboons, subhuman.

210
00:20:31,363 --> 00:20:32,625
Show him who we are.

211
00:20:32,664 --> 00:20:34,598
Think of your poor children,

212
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:38,433
your families suffering at home.

213
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:41,371
<i>The American white man</i>

214
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:44,864
<i>is raping your wives and daughters.</i>

215
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:48,402
<i>Jody is busy right now in your</i>
<i>bedroom, with your wife,</i>

216
00:20:48,447 --> 00:20:53,077
<i>your daughters, even your sons.</i>
<i>And who will stop him if you die today?</i>

217
00:20:53,118 --> 00:20:56,212
<i>Do you think the profitmongers</i>
<i>in Washington, D.C.</i>

218
00:20:56,255 --> 00:21:01,784
<i>care about your children?</i>
<i>They're not thinking of your children!</i>

219
00:21:01,827 --> 00:21:03,852
<i>They're home right now.</i>

220
00:21:03,895 --> 00:21:09,060
Asleep, in a nice warm bed.

221
00:21:10,669 --> 00:21:13,137
<i>Think about the sacrifice</i>
<i>you're making,</i>

222
00:21:13,171 --> 00:21:17,267
<i>just for the privilege of being</i>
<i>second-class citizens back home.</i>

223
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:19,971
<i>Where can you vote?</i>

224
00:21:20,012 --> 00:21:23,448
<i>Come to the winning side</i>

225
00:21:23,482 --> 00:21:27,043
<i>and, please, teach me those dances.</i>

226
00:21:27,085 --> 00:21:30,714
<i>That Lindy Hop and the Black Bottom.</i>

227
00:21:30,756 --> 00:21:33,281
<i>War is folly, boys.</i>

228
00:21:33,325 --> 00:21:37,261
Better to drop your guns,
give up and dance!

229
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:41,926
<i>Come out of that cold water, cats!</i>

230
00:21:42,601 --> 00:21:44,831
You got any more biscuits?

231
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:45,894
No.

232
00:21:45,937 --> 00:21:47,495
- Or anything else?
- Not for you.

233
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:49,666
I'll give you money
for a vitamin biscuit.

234
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:51,369
Go over and beg the Blacks.

235
00:21:53,445 --> 00:21:56,346
What about you?
You a replacement?

236
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:59,079
65th Army Corps.

237
00:21:59,117 --> 00:22:01,847
I thought they were freezing
their asses off in Russia.

238
00:22:01,887 --> 00:22:03,445
- So?
- You got any biscuits?

239
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:04,682
No.

240
00:22:04,723 --> 00:22:07,021
They must have given you something.

241
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:08,720
If I die, you can have all my rations,

242
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,557
but for now,
SHUT THE FUCK UP!!!

243
00:22:10,595 --> 00:22:13,029
I got a hole in my stomach.

244
00:22:13,065 --> 00:22:17,365
<i> Come on over.</i>
<i>Feel the warmth of the German people.</i>

245
00:22:17,402 --> 00:22:21,099
I can't hear a thing
over that damn whore's prattling.

246
00:22:21,139 --> 00:22:25,200
<i> We have hot food,</i>
<i>fried chicken,</i>

247
00:22:25,243 --> 00:22:29,543
<i>greens, candied yams</i>
<i>and even delicious biscuits</i>

248
00:22:29,581 --> 00:22:32,914
<i>straight from the oven,</i>
<i>just like your mama cooks.</i>

249
00:22:32,951 --> 00:22:35,579
Hey, boys.

250
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:40,751
I have two big white biscuits
right here for you.

251
00:22:40,792 --> 00:22:46,697
<i>Buffalo soldiers. Hey, cool cats.</i>

252
00:22:46,732 --> 00:22:49,701
<i>Do I have something</i>
<i>special for you.</i>

253
00:22:49,735 --> 00:22:53,136
<i>And you can have all you want.</i>

254
00:22:53,171 --> 00:22:57,107
That goddamned bitch
is gonna start a race riot.

255
00:22:57,142 --> 00:23:00,407
Is that a white woman, officer?
What's your name, soldier?

256
00:23:00,445 --> 00:23:03,437
- Lieutenant Birdsong, sir.
- Who is that?

257
00:23:03,482 --> 00:23:05,473
- You heard of Tokyo Rose, sir?
- Yeah.

258
00:23:05,517 --> 00:23:09,749
This is the Kraut version. Axis Sally.
She visits us from time to time.

259
00:23:09,788 --> 00:23:11,847
- Is she American?
- Don't know, sir.

260
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:15,519
<i> Have you ever wondered</i>
<i>how it felt to be free?</i>

261
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:21,123
<i>To be your own man?</i>
<i>To stand tall?</i>

262
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:24,727
Need a sniper to splat that nag's
brains all over the Serchio.

263
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:28,228
I can't see a thing outta these.
Roust me up a better set of cans.

264
00:23:28,273 --> 00:23:30,764
Right now, and a drink of water,
on the double.

265
00:23:30,809 --> 00:23:32,401
Yes, sir.

266
00:23:32,444 --> 00:23:35,777
Negative, Abel Six. Stay firm
and await further commands. Over.

267
00:23:35,814 --> 00:23:38,339
What's he gonna do,
give her a smack on the lips?

268
00:23:38,383 --> 00:23:42,547
He sets himself up a mile away with fire
control, then complains he can't see.

269
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:44,987
Oughta be with his men
like a real captain.

270
00:23:45,023 --> 00:23:47,116
He ain't been here
long enough to learn.

271
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:50,617
Yeah, and you won't be here
long neither, listenin' to him.

272
00:23:50,662 --> 00:23:52,254
Stupid white man.

273
00:23:53,999 --> 00:23:57,696
Right now!
Let's go, goddamn it.

274
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:03,237
New cans, fresh H2O, sir.

275
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:06,403
<i> Buffalo soldiers,</i>

276
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:09,608
<i>take the first step, fellas.</i>

277
00:24:09,648 --> 00:24:12,549
<i>We have warm fires. Pretty...</i>

278
00:24:12,584 --> 00:24:15,314
- Hold that.
- Yes, sir.

279
00:24:15,353 --> 00:24:18,550
Next time I want you
to take the caps off.

280
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:19,682
Yes, sir.

281
00:24:19,724 --> 00:24:24,058
German <i>Frauleins</i> like big strong bucks

282
00:24:24,095 --> 00:24:26,495
more than lollipops.

283
00:24:26,531 --> 00:24:29,159
<i>And we love lollipops.</i>

284
00:24:29,201 --> 00:24:31,260
She the one selling
hoecakes and beer?

285
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:33,294
Your brain's had a rough shuffle.

286
00:24:33,338 --> 00:24:36,171
For the last time, muzzle that shit!

287
00:24:36,208 --> 00:24:37,903
Coming down!

288
00:24:37,943 --> 00:24:40,411
- Let's go!
- Suppressing fire!

289
00:24:56,394 --> 00:24:57,986
Withdraw! Withdraw!

290
00:25:14,112 --> 00:25:16,376
Withdraw! Withdraw!

291
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:35,796
Come on, Train! Come on, move!
Go, go, go, go, go!

292
00:25:51,449 --> 00:25:52,575
Fire!

293
00:25:54,686 --> 00:25:56,449
Fire!

294
00:26:02,427 --> 00:26:06,955
George Company. Request artillery
to grids four, seven, nine and 1-6!

295
00:26:06,998 --> 00:26:09,432
- <i>Send the mail!</i>
- Where the hell are you?

296
00:26:09,467 --> 00:26:10,957
- We've crossed!
- You what?

297
00:26:11,002 --> 00:26:12,697
We're with Uncle Jerry!

298
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:16,195
Put smoke, H.A. to grids four,
seven, nine and 1-6!

299
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:19,267
It's impossible to be
on the other side of that river.

300
00:26:19,311 --> 00:26:23,407
- Is that Huggs calling out a grid?
- Huggs! What is your position?

301
00:26:23,448 --> 00:26:27,316
Sir! Huggs is down!
Stamps here! Send the mail!

302
00:26:27,352 --> 00:26:31,118
- Send the mail now!
- Write this name down. Stamps.

303
00:26:31,156 --> 00:26:32,919
Stamps. He's across?

304
00:26:36,461 --> 00:26:38,361
He's lying.

305
00:26:38,396 --> 00:26:41,661
Now, set fire to grids two-three,
two-four and two-five.

306
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:45,568
- That's Rudden, Fox Company.
- George Company? They've crossed?

307
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:48,300
I'm new to this outfit
doesn't mean I gotta argue

308
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:53,141
with goddamn second lieutenants acting
like uppity Negroes. You follow me?

309
00:26:54,579 --> 00:26:56,308
Do you follow me, soldier?

310
00:26:56,348 --> 00:26:59,681
Yes, sir.

311
00:26:59,718 --> 00:27:02,812
Smoke and fire to grids
two-three, two-four, two-five.

312
00:27:02,854 --> 00:27:05,118
- Sir.
- Smoke and fire to grids two-three,

313
00:27:05,156 --> 00:27:08,523
- two-four, two five. Over!
- Smoke and fire to grids two-three,

314
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,790
two-four and two-five!

315
00:27:10,829 --> 00:27:13,297
Adolf Hitler, this is for you.

316
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,131
What the hell!

317
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:21,328
Radio!

318
00:27:21,373 --> 00:27:23,364
- Withdraw!
- Withdrawing!

319
00:27:23,408 --> 00:27:26,639
Cease fire! Cease...

320
00:27:26,678 --> 00:27:29,044
Adjust fire! Adjust fire!

321
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,741
I repeat, adjust fire!

322
00:27:30,782 --> 00:27:35,583
Request artillery to grids four,
seven, nine and 1-6! Send the mail!

323
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:38,417
Fire!

324
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:44,253
Fire!

325
00:27:51,069 --> 00:27:52,730
Incoming!

326
00:28:11,656 --> 00:28:13,385
Get off me!

327
00:28:13,425 --> 00:28:14,915
Help!

328
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:19,721
Help! Help!

329
00:28:39,617 --> 00:28:41,141
Cover me!

330
00:30:43,942 --> 00:30:46,536
Come on. Come on.

331
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:03,551
OK. You and me gotta
get to that tree. OK?

332
00:31:03,595 --> 00:31:05,460
- All right.
- Go!

333
00:31:08,466 --> 00:31:10,991
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

334
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:16,704
Get down, get down, get down!

335
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:28,978
Oh! Oh, Lord!

336
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:32,786
Oh, I'm coming up yonder!
Meet me, Jesus!

337
00:31:32,824 --> 00:31:35,019
- Shut up.
- Oh, Bishop, they got you, too.

338
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:38,256
- No. Listen!
- Is we dead, Bishop? We dead?

339
00:31:38,296 --> 00:31:41,231
No, listen to me. You was dead.
OK? But I brung ya back.

340
00:31:41,266 --> 00:31:45,134
You ain't dyin' till I get my
money. You owe me $1,400.

341
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:53,071
Look here. Go check out that
haystack. That shit is moving.

342
00:31:54,212 --> 00:31:55,736
What in the world?

343
00:32:02,186 --> 00:32:03,346
Arturo!

344
00:32:04,389 --> 00:32:06,380
Arturo, where are you?

345
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:10,360
Arturo!

346
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:14,029
Arturo.

347
00:32:31,983 --> 00:32:34,110
Beautiful.

348
00:32:34,152 --> 00:32:35,779
Where did you find it?

349
00:32:42,427 --> 00:32:44,088
Watch me throw it.

350
00:32:47,098 --> 00:32:49,089
<i> # Little black face</i>

351
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:50,964
<i># Beautiful Abyssinian</i>

352
00:32:51,002 --> 00:32:54,597

356
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:10,185
Arturo! Now, I am nine years old.

357
00:33:22,033 --> 00:33:23,762
Move, sniper bait, go!

358
00:33:36,881 --> 00:33:41,750
Okay,
maybe I'm eight. I'm really only eight.

359
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:05,168
Good God!

360
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:08,372
A Chocolate Giant.

361
00:34:11,582 --> 00:34:13,709
Help me.

362
00:34:13,751 --> 00:34:16,720
I'll give you a banana,
Chocolate Giant.

363
00:34:20,691 --> 00:34:24,559
Sorry, boy. I done gived it
every muscle I got.

364
00:34:24,595 --> 00:34:27,462
Use your tail,
Chocolate Giant.

365
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:35,498
Jesus is waitin' on you, child.

366
00:34:36,808 --> 00:34:39,902
This world ain't worth
a pinch of snuff nohow.

367
00:34:41,546 --> 00:34:44,037
No, please don't leave.

368
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:46,778
Oh, my God, it hurts.

369
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:54,752
Come on. Come on.

370
00:35:20,251 --> 00:35:23,015
Boy! Hey, boy! Hey!

371
00:35:23,054 --> 00:35:25,318
Boy. You breathin'?

372
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:29,988
Giant,
you don't taste like chocolate.

373
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:54,449
Don't shoot. Don't shoot.

374
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:57,052
You can't kill me.

375
00:35:58,022 --> 00:35:59,250
I'm invisible!

376
00:36:40,932 --> 00:36:44,299
Come on, boy. Come on.

377
00:36:44,335 --> 00:36:45,461
Let's go.

378
00:36:54,478 --> 00:36:57,242
Train! Train!

379
00:36:57,281 --> 00:36:59,146
Oh, no.

380
00:37:23,107 --> 00:37:25,974
Where's Train?

381
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:28,376
He ain't...
He ain't make it.

382
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:31,643
That nigger's dumber than a dime.
You sent him over the hill?

383
00:37:31,682 --> 00:37:34,480
- I ain't tell him to risk his life.
- It's nobody's fault.

384
00:37:34,518 --> 00:37:36,543
That boy was born over the hill.

385
00:37:39,323 --> 00:37:41,018
Follow me.

386
00:37:58,476 --> 00:38:01,274
Special delivery for the <i>Führer.</i>

387
00:38:23,701 --> 00:38:25,760
Holy Mother of God.

388
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:06,999
Train!

389
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,341
Train!

390
00:39:11,382 --> 00:39:14,408
Train, you damn fool!
I thought you was dead!

391
00:39:16,787 --> 00:39:18,812
Told you
he was going over the hill.

392
00:39:25,963 --> 00:39:29,296
Oh, no.
The fuck is he...

393
00:39:29,333 --> 00:39:31,801
We wait here till dark,
and then we cross back.

394
00:39:31,836 --> 00:39:33,201
Good.

395
00:39:33,237 --> 00:39:35,535
This shit is heavy as hell.

396
00:39:41,178 --> 00:39:43,339
Bishop!

397
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:46,680
- Where you going?
- Y'all go on back across that river.

398
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:49,686
The only person with any luck
around here is him.

399
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:52,985
Plus, he owe me $1,400.
That's the kind of money

400
00:39:53,023 --> 00:39:55,355
that can set me up
for the rest of my life.

401
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:57,384
Even if the rest of my life is today.

402
00:40:10,674 --> 00:40:12,835
To hell with this.

403
00:40:15,279 --> 00:40:16,678
I'm up shit's creek.

404
00:40:56,921 --> 00:41:00,186
- Jesse Owens!
- Jack Johnson.

405
00:41:00,224 --> 00:41:03,216
You go talk to your wife up there.

406
00:41:22,746 --> 00:41:27,149
I never felt so lonesome
in my whole life, Bishop.

407
00:41:27,184 --> 00:41:31,018
- I been dreaming a lot.
- Yeah.

408
00:41:31,055 --> 00:41:35,958
Nigga, I ain't really interested in your
dreams. I want my motherfucking money.

409
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:39,224
I got something's
worth more than $1,400.

410
00:41:41,031 --> 00:41:43,795
Better than black cat's bones.
Make you invisible.

411
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:45,665
Gives the strength of five people!

412
00:41:45,703 --> 00:41:48,399
I think your cheese
done slid off your biscuit.

413
00:41:48,439 --> 00:41:51,738
You never see me chalk the line
for no white kid like you done.

414
00:41:51,775 --> 00:41:54,573
- You told me to!
- I didn't tell you to get us killed.

415
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:00,746
This uniform don't change nothing for
us. This is a white man's war, Train.

416
00:42:00,784 --> 00:42:05,517
Negroes ain't got nothing to do with
this. This boy ain't got no life nohow.

417
00:42:05,556 --> 00:42:08,650
Why he don't? Hmm?

418
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:12,753
A life of goodness is not what these
white folk has chosen for they children.

419
00:42:12,796 --> 00:42:15,026
Look at me.

420
00:42:16,834 --> 00:42:20,964
Good book says it, Proverbs 22:16.

421
00:42:21,005 --> 00:42:26,033
"Raise up a child the way you want him
to go, and he will not depart from it."

422
00:42:26,076 --> 00:42:28,044
Now, he's trained to hate.

423
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:33,279
Shit, his life ain't worth
a dollar of Chinese money.

424
00:42:33,317 --> 00:42:36,013
Listen here, Bishop.

425
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:39,250
This boy ain't done nothing to you.

426
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:41,087
Mm-hm.

427
00:42:41,125 --> 00:42:43,821
You didn't want him before, did you?

428
00:42:48,966 --> 00:42:52,527
- Where you goin', Sam Train?
- Hey, Stamps, we movin' or not?

429
00:42:57,241 --> 00:43:00,404
We hold here till night.
Me and Bishop'll take first watch.

430
00:43:00,444 --> 00:43:04,278
Hector, you and Train take second.
Give the boy whatever first aid you got.

431
00:43:13,958 --> 00:43:17,553
What'd you get us into now, Diesel?

432
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:22,259
It's always something with you,
big fella. Here, you gonna need these.

433
00:43:22,299 --> 00:43:24,733
Come on, kid.
Eat.

434
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:26,167
Eat.

435
00:43:27,171 --> 00:43:29,162
Come on.

436
00:43:29,206 --> 00:43:31,003
He won't take the medicine.

437
00:43:37,748 --> 00:43:39,807
Go on, give it here.

438
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:42,216
You want some chocolate, boy?

439
00:43:45,322 --> 00:43:48,257
I wouldn't get attached.
He'll be dead in a week.

440
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:53,252
I ain't never been this close
to a white person before, Hec.

441
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:56,528
Never even touched one.
Not even a dead one.

442
00:43:56,567 --> 00:43:59,934
If this one dies, I'll give you
a whistle as a consolation prize.

443
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:02,962
- You really think he'll die?
- Why worry about it?

444
00:44:03,007 --> 00:44:04,998
We could all be dead
in an hour anyway.

445
00:44:11,949 --> 00:44:13,974
Why you always kissing that thing, Hec?

446
00:44:14,018 --> 00:44:18,853
- Reminds me who my father is.
- I don't need help remembering my pa.

447
00:44:18,889 --> 00:44:22,518
His name's Chester.
Chester Train.

448
00:44:22,559 --> 00:44:24,390
Let's give this kid some water.

449
00:44:28,766 --> 00:44:29,790
Water.

450
00:44:33,937 --> 00:44:34,995
Arturo?

451
00:44:35,939 --> 00:44:38,271
Can I ask you something?

452
00:44:38,308 --> 00:44:39,707
What you want, boy?

453
00:44:39,743 --> 00:44:41,643
Can you tell me who I am?

454
00:44:42,846 --> 00:44:45,781
Hector, you speak that Italian?
What's he saying?

455
00:44:45,816 --> 00:44:48,284
He said, "Who am I?"
But who's he talking to?

456
00:44:48,318 --> 00:44:50,343
Lord, I knew it!

457
00:44:50,387 --> 00:44:53,083
I could see it in his face!
Look at him, Hec.

458
00:44:53,123 --> 00:44:54,920
Shh! Quiet down.

459
00:44:54,958 --> 00:44:57,426
Good God!

460
00:44:57,461 --> 00:44:59,361
- He got the power!
- What power?

461
00:44:59,396 --> 00:45:03,423
God knows it. In the olden days,
everything could speak.

462
00:45:03,467 --> 00:45:05,867
- The trees, the birds.
- Shh!

463
00:45:05,903 --> 00:45:10,101
If you could hear them things,
then that mean you had it.

464
00:45:13,644 --> 00:45:18,308
This boy's standing
in the shadow of God, Hector.

465
00:45:18,348 --> 00:45:22,478
Thank you, Jesus! Thank you for standing
on Your holy righteous word, Lord!

466
00:45:22,519 --> 00:45:25,283
Hallelujah! Thank you, Jesus!

467
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:46,967
As you were.

468
00:46:14,371 --> 00:46:18,000
- General Almond.
- Colonel.

469
00:46:18,041 --> 00:46:20,874
I have a photo you should see, sir.

470
00:46:20,911 --> 00:46:25,007
Forget that a minute. How bad
are the numbers from yesterday?

471
00:46:25,048 --> 00:46:27,642
- Bad, sir.
- And Ike gets mad when he gives me

472
00:46:27,684 --> 00:46:30,517
waiters and shoeshine boys
to fight the Krauts with.

473
00:46:30,554 --> 00:46:33,580
Germans are dug in.
And that gun at La Spezia's killing us.

474
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:38,084
Fifteen thousand colored soldiers.
One in four is a casualty.

475
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:41,222
And all I'm hearing about
is one goddamned gun?

476
00:46:41,265 --> 00:46:45,167
We have guns, too, here.
Look, see, colonel? I got one.

477
00:46:45,202 --> 00:46:49,832
This colored division...
This is an experiment, Jack.

478
00:46:49,873 --> 00:46:54,936
An experiment. These are the first lady
Eleanor Roosevelt's niggers. Not ours.

479
00:46:54,978 --> 00:46:59,847
- Sir, I respectfully disagree.
- That's why they sent you here, Jack.

480
00:46:59,883 --> 00:47:02,647
To lead me into the New World.

481
00:47:04,354 --> 00:47:08,120
A gift from the Brits.
Taken at 11,000 feet. See?

482
00:47:08,158 --> 00:47:11,650
That's a German buildup at
Lama Di Sotto. Two or three regiments.

483
00:47:11,695 --> 00:47:14,630
- Surprise attack you worried about?
- I hope not.

484
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:16,462
I got corroboration from a partisan.

485
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:18,991
Anybody crush grapes
with feet can't be trusted.

486
00:47:19,036 --> 00:47:20,936
Get some Krauts to confirm.

487
00:47:20,971 --> 00:47:23,735
Already working on it, sir.
Captain Rudden!

488
00:47:27,077 --> 00:47:30,672
- Good evening, general.
- Come.

489
00:47:30,714 --> 00:47:34,411
Germans may be planning counter-
offensive down the Serchio Valley.

490
00:47:34,451 --> 00:47:37,443
We need a POW to confirm.
You running patrols there?

491
00:47:37,487 --> 00:47:40,320
George Company has a squad
sitting right in that area.

492
00:47:40,357 --> 00:47:42,621
- How?
- They pushed across the Serchio

493
00:47:42,659 --> 00:47:46,356
beyond Hill Maine at the weak point.
I heard them call for artillery.

494
00:47:46,396 --> 00:47:50,594
Might've broken Jerry's hold
on the river. Captain Nokes didn't fire.

495
00:47:50,634 --> 00:47:53,398
- Why not?
- He couldn't see 'em, sir.

496
00:47:53,437 --> 00:47:55,871
Didn't believe they crossed,
they got hung up.

497
00:47:55,906 --> 00:47:59,342
I had Fox Company positioned
down the river from George Company.

498
00:47:59,376 --> 00:48:02,345
Got pretty hot over there.
Four of 'em right up a mountain.

499
00:48:02,379 --> 00:48:04,609
Got weapons and a radio
if they're alive.

500
00:48:04,648 --> 00:48:07,378
- Who are the four men?
- Shouldn't be hard to find out.

501
00:48:07,417 --> 00:48:09,885
One of them's the biggest Negro
you've ever seen in your life.

502
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:11,945
Mmm.

503
00:48:11,989 --> 00:48:15,083
Very well then. Dismissed.

504
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:22,289
My God, I've had it.

505
00:49:22,326 --> 00:49:23,850
Come on, it's enough.

506
00:49:24,995 --> 00:49:26,019
Yeah, let's go.

507
00:49:27,831 --> 00:49:29,298
I need something to eat.

508
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:34,695
The Germans are leaving!

509
00:49:44,448 --> 00:49:48,111
Push it up
or I'll kill it right now.

510
00:49:48,151 --> 00:49:49,982
I'm pushing as hard
as I can.

511
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:51,749
Pull, pull, pull.

512
00:49:51,788 --> 00:49:54,689
My goodness I'm hungry.

513
00:49:54,725 --> 00:49:58,991
Finally something to chew on,
rather than the slime they feed us.

514
00:50:02,933 --> 00:50:05,231
Goodbye meat.
Now there'll be nothing left.

515
00:50:05,268 --> 00:50:07,634
They won't get fat on it.

516
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:09,229
Let's hope they choke on it.

517
00:50:09,272 --> 00:50:11,832
Shut up, the two of you!

518
00:50:11,875 --> 00:50:15,140
Now, let's see if your husband
will come back from Russia.

519
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:24,320
Mary, Joseph, Jesus,

520
00:50:24,354 --> 00:50:27,118
tell us if we'll see him
or never see him again.

521
00:50:27,157 --> 00:50:28,647
Is he still alive?

522
00:50:28,692 --> 00:50:30,660
My eyes aren't
what they used to be.

523
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:32,992
Come on!

524
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:34,327
So, so, so?

525
00:50:34,364 --> 00:50:37,697
We can't even joke? Come on.

526
00:50:39,102 --> 00:50:41,127
That thing is just a stupid kid's game.

527
00:50:41,171 --> 00:50:43,196
You're the usual scoundrel!

528
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:45,640
Just because he carries
the Fascist Party card,

529
00:50:45,675 --> 00:50:46,699
he thinks he can do what he wants.

530
00:50:46,743 --> 00:50:48,210
Oh yes?

531
00:50:48,245 --> 00:50:51,612
Then who was it who took butter
from the Germans the other day?

532
00:50:51,648 --> 00:50:52,740
The Pope?

533
00:50:52,783 --> 00:50:54,842
Maybe, because it wasn't us.

534
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:56,182
And the light?

535
00:50:56,219 --> 00:50:57,777
How did your electricity come back on?

536
00:50:57,821 --> 00:50:58,981
Papa.

537
00:50:59,022 --> 00:51:00,182
Come with me.

538
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:01,247
Come with me.

539
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:03,783
How did the light come back on?

540
00:51:03,827 --> 00:51:06,660
The truth will never
come out of his mouth.

541
00:51:16,139 --> 00:51:18,300
You would think that
after all these years,

542
00:51:18,341 --> 00:51:20,969
you would treat your friends better.

543
00:51:21,011 --> 00:51:23,377
What is wrong with you, Papa?

544
00:51:23,413 --> 00:51:24,505
Would you tell me?

545
00:51:28,952 --> 00:51:30,681
It's Natalina.

546
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:32,153
What did she do?

547
00:51:32,189 --> 00:51:34,054
She put the evil eye on me, that Witch.

548
00:51:34,091 --> 00:51:36,423
You still going on about the same story?

549
00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:39,691
The Germans stole your rabbits, not her.

550
00:51:41,231 --> 00:51:44,098
There's strange things going on.

551
00:51:44,134 --> 00:51:46,602
My electricity returned...

552
00:51:46,636 --> 00:51:48,536
from God knows where
after two and a half years.

553
00:51:48,572 --> 00:51:50,233
I was going to ask you about that.

554
00:51:50,273 --> 00:51:53,970
Now I'm lit up like a carnival...

555
00:51:54,010 --> 00:51:57,741
for every bandit and German to see.

556
00:51:57,781 --> 00:52:01,444
It's Natalina's fault. She wants to see
me dead and buried behind the Church.

557
00:52:01,485 --> 00:52:02,884
What are you talking about?

558
00:52:04,654 --> 00:52:06,451
She prays for you every day.

559
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:09,853
Know what I say?

560
00:52:11,061 --> 00:52:16,158
You go back in there
and apologize to your friends.

561
00:52:16,199 --> 00:52:18,531
Tell everyone that
Mussolini disgusts you,

562
00:52:18,568 --> 00:52:21,298
and that you are not a Fascist anymore.

563
00:52:21,338 --> 00:52:25,502
Il Duce made us a world power again.

564
00:52:25,542 --> 00:52:28,375
His only mistake was to get in bed
with that imbecile Hitler.

565
00:52:28,411 --> 00:52:30,971
Papa, II Duce betrayed Italy.

566
00:52:31,014 --> 00:52:33,778
And now you'll see
how this is going to end.

567
00:52:33,817 --> 00:52:36,115
You are still so young, my child.

568
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:38,053
You don't know the ways of the world.

569
00:52:38,088 --> 00:52:40,579
But you will learn.

570
00:52:40,624 --> 00:52:42,717
And from whom?

571
00:52:42,759 --> 00:52:44,090
From a Fascist like you?

572
00:52:45,095 --> 00:52:47,222
You're just like your mother.

573
00:52:47,264 --> 00:52:48,993
And she used to tell you
that Blackshirts

574
00:52:49,032 --> 00:52:50,932
are only good for hiding dirt.

575
00:52:50,967 --> 00:52:52,127
Okay, let's go.

576
00:52:59,309 --> 00:53:00,674
Germans!!!

577
00:53:02,379 --> 00:53:03,471
It's your house.

578
00:53:14,357 --> 00:53:15,483
Holy Mother of God.

579
00:53:23,233 --> 00:53:24,564
It's okay.

580
00:53:24,601 --> 00:53:26,569
It's okay.

581
00:53:26,603 --> 00:53:27,695
It's okay, it's okay.

582
00:53:30,974 --> 00:53:33,602
Hector, ask who's in charge.
Tell them we're Americans.

583
00:53:37,714 --> 00:53:39,204
Americans?

584
00:53:39,249 --> 00:53:41,274
Me, too. Half.

585
00:53:41,318 --> 00:53:42,580
Half.

586
00:53:42,619 --> 00:53:45,213
Me sister Ida, half.

587
00:53:45,255 --> 00:53:48,019
We called her little Ida,
because she was the baby.

588
00:53:48,058 --> 00:53:50,322
Put us together,
we make one American.

589
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:51,793
Okay, wait. Wait.

590
00:53:51,828 --> 00:53:54,695
Wait. Wait. Wait.

591
00:53:54,731 --> 00:53:55,959
Thank you.

592
00:53:55,999 --> 00:53:57,261
Who's in charge here?

593
00:54:09,145 --> 00:54:11,613
Anybody here speak English?

594
00:54:14,150 --> 00:54:15,412
Where are the Germans?

595
00:54:15,452 --> 00:54:18,683
Everywhere. Boom, boom.

596
00:54:18,722 --> 00:54:21,452
My name is Renata.

597
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:28,263
- Where'd you learn English?
- I was nanny for a British family.

598
00:54:28,298 --> 00:54:32,860
And a jolly good tuck-in-the-bed
tinkerer you must be.

599
00:54:32,902 --> 00:54:36,838
- You can nanny me. Want a Camel?
- Cool it, Bishop.

600
00:54:36,873 --> 00:54:41,037
I'm Staff Sergeant Aubrey Stamps.
We got a boy that needs help.

601
00:54:41,077 --> 00:54:42,806
A boy? He has a boy.

602
00:54:45,015 --> 00:54:46,505
Oh, my God.

603
00:54:47,484 --> 00:54:49,577
Is he alive? Put him here.

604
00:54:49,619 --> 00:54:51,211
Slow. Slowly.

605
00:54:53,323 --> 00:54:55,052
Where did you find him?

606
00:54:55,091 --> 00:54:57,286
On the Mountain.
Do you know him?

607
00:54:57,327 --> 00:54:59,386
No, I don't know him.

608
00:54:59,429 --> 00:55:01,897
But he can stay here
until he gets better.

609
00:55:01,931 --> 00:55:05,128
Tell them we're taking the boy
to a hospital. They can come.

610
00:55:05,168 --> 00:55:08,399
They need to evacuate.
We'll escort them down the mountain.

611
00:55:08,438 --> 00:55:11,202
We're going to a hospital.
You can come with us.

612
00:55:12,075 --> 00:55:14,134
The hospital around the corner?

613
00:55:14,177 --> 00:55:16,372
The Germans are everywhere.

614
00:55:16,413 --> 00:55:18,438
Torrite, Rontano, Mezzana.

615
00:55:18,481 --> 00:55:20,949
All the way to Barga
and down to the Serchio.

616
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:23,782
I don't know how you
got past Vergemoli.

617
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:27,483
The only way to Pietrasanta...

618
00:55:27,524 --> 00:55:29,185
where the Americans might be...

619
00:55:29,225 --> 00:55:30,749
is over that way,

620
00:55:31,761 --> 00:55:33,786
over the Mountain of the Sleeping Man.

621
00:55:35,031 --> 00:55:36,259
Says we're surrounded.

622
00:55:36,299 --> 00:55:38,460
Doesn't know how we got
past German lines,

623
00:55:38,501 --> 00:55:41,732
but the only way we might find
some Americans is up there.

624
00:55:41,771 --> 00:55:44,137
- The Mountain of the Sleeping Man.
- Sleeping Man?

625
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:47,575
- What is that?
- It's a legend.

626
00:55:47,610 --> 00:55:53,571
A shepherd fell in love with a girl
who would not love him back.

627
00:55:53,616 --> 00:55:56,312
So he lays across the Mountain...

628
00:55:56,353 --> 00:55:58,753
to protect her from the wind and rain.

629
00:55:58,788 --> 00:56:02,986
He still lies there today,
to protect us all.

630
00:56:03,026 --> 00:56:07,395
Legend has it that
one day he will awaken.

631
00:56:10,166 --> 00:56:12,726
A legend about a shepherd
that fell in love...

632
00:56:12,769 --> 00:56:15,067
Whatever she's saying,
we gotta rest until sunup.

633
00:56:15,105 --> 00:56:17,369
- OK.
- Stay here? No, no.

634
00:56:17,407 --> 00:56:19,136
Stay here. <i>Si, si.</i>

635
00:56:19,175 --> 00:56:22,167
If they sing to the Krauts,
we will pull a trigger on this

636
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:26,046
and tell the hammer to hurry. Won't be
nothing but powder and steel here.

637
00:56:26,082 --> 00:56:29,643
We are not Germans.
We are Italians.

638
00:56:29,686 --> 00:56:32,052
- Full blood.
- And what are we? Half blood?

639
00:56:34,657 --> 00:56:36,955
We should take him...

640
00:56:36,993 --> 00:56:38,722
and put him to bed.

641
00:56:38,762 --> 00:56:41,993
The boy stays here. He's sick.

642
00:56:59,082 --> 00:57:00,549
<i>Heil</i> Hitler!

643
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:32,809
Catching up on your reading?

644
00:57:32,849 --> 00:57:35,977
Yes, Colonel, I'm informing myself
about the enemy.

645
00:57:36,019 --> 00:57:40,353
The Partisans often take their names
from banned poetry and literature.

646
00:57:40,390 --> 00:57:42,358
This helps us identify them.

647
00:57:42,392 --> 00:57:44,587
Who is the poet?

648
00:57:44,627 --> 00:57:46,356
Giovanni Pascoli.

649
00:57:46,396 --> 00:57:51,857
Do you think it's appropriate
to waste your time reading poetry?

650
00:57:51,901 --> 00:57:57,771
In the past nine months we've seen
a sharp rise in Partisan activity.

651
00:57:57,807 --> 00:58:00,105
What are you planning to do about it?

652
00:58:00,143 --> 00:58:04,204
Colonel, we are down
to shovels and mule shit.

653
00:58:04,247 --> 00:58:05,714
My men are exhausted.

654
00:58:05,748 --> 00:58:07,943
We need ammo and food.

655
00:58:07,984 --> 00:58:10,612
Food? You want food?

656
00:58:10,653 --> 00:58:13,349
You can suck icicles
in Russia...

657
00:58:13,389 --> 00:58:18,725
like you did before your so-called
neck wound brought you back here.

658
00:58:18,761 --> 00:58:22,322
You think you're the first
to command hungry troops?

659
00:58:22,365 --> 00:58:25,528
I mean no disrespect, Colonel.

660
00:58:27,203 --> 00:58:30,502
Good. Listen closely.

661
00:58:30,540 --> 00:58:33,407
I have come too far to repeat myself.

662
00:58:33,443 --> 00:58:37,709
First, there is a peasant, a terrorist.

663
00:58:37,747 --> 00:58:42,480
Named The Great Butterfly.
He's causing many problems.

664
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:45,147
He's hiding in these mountains.
Find him.

665
00:58:45,188 --> 00:58:48,453
When he is found,
issue Directive Bandenbefehl...

666
00:58:48,491 --> 00:58:51,153
to him and his criminal friends.

667
00:58:51,194 --> 00:58:52,252
Bandenbefehl?

668
00:58:52,295 --> 00:58:54,923
Is there an echo out here?

669
00:58:54,964 --> 00:58:59,094
General Kesselring's standing
field order for the Italian Republic.

670
00:58:59,135 --> 00:59:01,626
At a commander's sole discretion,

671
00:59:01,671 --> 00:59:04,469
for every one German soldier killed,

672
00:59:04,507 --> 00:59:06,873
we execute ten Italian civilians.

673
00:59:06,910 --> 00:59:12,439
You should have been capable to execute
that order at least once in nine months.

674
00:59:12,482 --> 00:59:16,111
Colonel, with all due respect,
if I execute this order...

675
00:59:16,152 --> 00:59:18,677
my men would kill innocent civilians.

676
00:59:18,721 --> 00:59:22,350
It would be a violation
of the Geneva Convention.

677
00:59:22,392 --> 00:59:27,159
Partisans are not civilians;
they are terrorists.

678
00:59:27,196 --> 00:59:30,131
They are not protected
under the Geneva Convention.

679
00:59:30,166 --> 00:59:32,532
Bandenbefehl!

680
00:59:32,569 --> 00:59:33,729
Bandenbefehl.

681
00:59:36,072 --> 00:59:39,439
Secondly, the surprise
counterattack is still planned.

682
00:59:39,475 --> 00:59:43,969
I will tighten supply lines
with food and ammunition.

683
00:59:44,013 --> 00:59:46,311
And three:

684
00:59:46,349 --> 00:59:50,217
A delicate intelligence matter
of the utmost priority.

685
00:59:56,159 --> 00:59:59,026
We are missing a Corporal...

686
00:59:59,062 --> 01:00:02,691
from the 35th Regiment,
2nd Battalion, 5th Company.

687
01:00:02,732 --> 01:00:06,725
Name: Hans Brandt,
gone AWOL three weeks ago.

688
01:00:06,769 --> 01:00:09,738
We have some every day.
What's so special about him?

689
01:00:10,673 --> 01:00:13,141
You and I are not here...

690
01:00:13,176 --> 01:00:17,010
to question the Führer's orders.

691
01:00:17,046 --> 01:00:19,606
You are to send out a search party.

692
01:00:19,649 --> 01:00:21,139
Find him.

693
01:00:21,184 --> 01:00:22,879
Don't let him escape.

694
01:00:22,919 --> 01:00:24,910
And when you have him...

695
01:00:25,955 --> 01:00:28,822
get word to me immediately.

696
01:00:37,967 --> 01:00:39,696
Let's go!

697
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:54,275
<i> If I am no longer</i>
<i>that lamp...</i>

698
01:00:54,317 --> 01:00:57,115
<i>which flickers in front</i>
<i>of a sweet Maria.</i>

699
01:00:57,153 --> 01:00:58,620
What does that mean?

700
01:00:59,856 --> 01:01:01,653
God help this poor bastard Brandt.

701
01:01:02,525 --> 01:01:03,924
Whatever he's done,

702
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:06,827
it's no worse than what anyone else
has done in this war.

703
01:01:07,563 --> 01:01:08,928
Mount a search party.

704
01:01:08,965 --> 01:01:10,956
We have to find him first,

705
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,992
hold him and give him a few days...

706
01:01:14,037 --> 01:01:17,131
before Pflueger pulls out
his teeth, one by one.

707
01:01:17,173 --> 01:01:18,197
Yes.

708
01:01:18,641 --> 01:01:21,007
I'll be relieved when this war is over.

709
01:01:21,044 --> 01:01:22,909
I want to return to my family.

710
01:01:51,941 --> 01:01:54,136
I've watched you grow up.

711
01:01:54,177 --> 01:01:56,441
But you haven't become much.

712
01:01:56,479 --> 01:01:57,946
And he can't do much.

713
01:01:57,980 --> 01:01:59,845
- You're laughing at me?
- Of course.

714
01:01:59,882 --> 01:02:02,350
Where did you get that?

715
01:02:02,385 --> 01:02:03,875
So many things you want to know.

716
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:05,012
Here. Take it and eat.

717
01:02:05,054 --> 01:02:06,385
Give me some, too.

718
01:02:06,422 --> 01:02:08,686
Are you afraid you're
not going to get any?

719
01:02:08,725 --> 01:02:09,885
Here. Grow.

720
01:02:09,926 --> 01:02:11,553
Give me a chestnut, too.

721
01:02:13,229 --> 01:02:15,026
My goodness, you stink like a sheep.

722
01:02:15,064 --> 01:02:16,725
Hey, leave me alone.

723
01:02:16,766 --> 01:02:18,700
Aren't you the dandy?

724
01:02:18,735 --> 01:02:20,498
Ah, he's offended.

725
01:02:25,875 --> 01:02:28,503
What the fuck are you doing, Peppi?

726
01:02:28,544 --> 01:02:30,239
You have to be on the lookout.

727
01:02:30,279 --> 01:02:33,510
If I had been a German,
you would all be dead... 1, 2, 3.

728
01:02:33,549 --> 01:02:35,176
I almost choked.

729
01:02:36,219 --> 01:02:37,846
You wait here.

730
01:02:53,069 --> 01:02:54,331
My friend.

731
01:02:54,370 --> 01:02:56,634
The Americans are getting closer.

732
01:02:57,907 --> 01:02:59,898
We have to warn them about
the Germans' counterattack.

733
01:02:59,942 --> 01:03:02,069
They know it already, for sure.

734
01:03:03,146 --> 01:03:05,171
You? How are you?

735
01:03:05,214 --> 01:03:07,444
Me? I'm okay.

736
01:03:07,483 --> 01:03:08,541
You?

737
01:03:08,584 --> 01:03:11,075
I always have Marco's
face in front of my eyes.

738
01:03:14,423 --> 01:03:15,651
Don't worry about that.

739
01:03:15,691 --> 01:03:20,924
My brother is dead.
Nobody cares about him any more.

740
01:03:20,963 --> 01:03:22,089
I care.

741
01:03:22,131 --> 01:03:23,530
In your opinion...

742
01:03:24,433 --> 01:03:25,832
when we will be in front of God,

743
01:03:25,868 --> 01:03:28,701
if we ever get there,

744
01:03:28,738 --> 01:03:31,707
is he going to ask us
for our political card?

745
01:03:31,741 --> 01:03:34,710
Is he going to say,
"Marco, no... Ludovico, no.

746
01:03:34,744 --> 01:03:38,236
You're not allowed in
because you're Fascists."

747
01:03:38,281 --> 01:03:42,877
What's the difference between
us and them in the eyes of God?

748
01:03:42,919 --> 01:03:45,183
You're asking yourself
too many questions.

749
01:03:45,221 --> 01:03:48,816
If you think too much,
it will drive you crazy.

750
01:03:48,858 --> 01:03:51,452
And then who will kill the Germans?

751
01:03:51,494 --> 01:03:52,518
Hey.

752
01:03:54,764 --> 01:03:57,164
Anyway, what's done is done.

753
01:04:05,007 --> 01:04:09,307
George Company to 370,
George Company to 3-7, over.

754
01:04:13,649 --> 01:04:16,243
George Company to 370, over.

755
01:04:40,042 --> 01:04:42,738
Someone tell that
big beast to get out of my room.

756
01:04:42,778 --> 01:04:45,838
Shh! The Boy has a fever.

757
01:04:45,882 --> 01:04:48,510
He needs to eat and get some rest.

758
01:04:48,551 --> 01:04:50,542
Try thinking of others
every once in awhile.

759
01:05:00,463 --> 01:05:01,760
Arturo.

760
01:05:02,832 --> 01:05:05,300
The Chocolate Giant's Castle...

761
01:05:05,334 --> 01:05:07,165
if you could only see it.

762
01:05:07,203 --> 01:05:09,694
It's enormous.

763
01:05:09,739 --> 01:05:11,900
No, even bigger.

764
01:05:12,742 --> 01:05:15,302
Of course I saw it.

765
01:05:15,344 --> 01:05:17,471
It's all made of chocolate.

766
01:05:17,513 --> 01:05:19,481
You break a piece off,

767
01:05:19,515 --> 01:05:21,312
and it grows back.

768
01:05:23,452 --> 01:05:25,716
Yes, I did save a piece for you.

769
01:05:33,195 --> 01:05:34,685
Good heavens.

770
01:05:34,730 --> 01:05:36,220
Something's not right.

771
01:05:36,265 --> 01:05:37,664
Someone put the evil eye on him.

772
01:05:37,700 --> 01:05:39,998
Bewitched or not, he's got to go.

773
01:05:40,036 --> 01:05:42,869
- To where?
- With the Americans.

774
01:05:42,905 --> 01:05:44,566
I think he brings good luck.
The Boy stays.

775
01:05:44,607 --> 01:05:46,234
This is my house.

776
01:05:46,275 --> 01:05:47,640
I have a house too.

777
01:05:48,611 --> 01:05:50,010
Natalina.

778
01:05:50,046 --> 01:05:51,536
What do you think?

779
01:05:51,580 --> 01:05:54,640
I say this Boy is talking to the Devil.

780
01:05:54,684 --> 01:05:56,208
We need a Priest here.

781
01:05:56,252 --> 01:05:58,413
He doesn't need a Priest.
He needs a Doctor.

782
01:05:58,454 --> 01:06:01,321
A Priest can take
the Devil out of him.

783
01:06:01,357 --> 01:06:04,383
Train, get up. We gotta book.

784
01:06:08,898 --> 01:06:10,092
Excuse me.

785
01:06:10,132 --> 01:06:13,568
Hey, boy. Hey.

786
01:06:13,602 --> 01:06:17,663
Time for you
to take your medicine again.

787
01:06:18,474 --> 01:06:20,032
Here it comes. Ready?

788
01:06:23,779 --> 01:06:26,270
There. Thank you.

789
01:06:27,950 --> 01:06:30,009
Get you some of that soup, boy.

790
01:06:31,087 --> 01:06:32,179
Mmm.

791
01:06:36,826 --> 01:06:39,624
- Yes.
- He would not eat before.

792
01:06:42,765 --> 01:06:44,323
Here you go, boy.

793
01:06:46,202 --> 01:06:48,136
It's all over your shirt.

794
01:06:50,873 --> 01:06:54,434
- Come on, boy. Let's go.
- My Chocolate Giant.

795
01:06:54,477 --> 01:06:58,345
- OK, sarge. We ready.
- Oh, hold on, hold on, hold on.

796
01:06:58,381 --> 01:07:01,282
We? Boy, where the hell "we" goin'?

797
01:07:01,317 --> 01:07:03,410
You wasn't chiseling him,
we wouldn't be here.

798
01:07:03,452 --> 01:07:06,080
- You think Nokes is lookin' for us?
- What?

799
01:07:07,656 --> 01:07:10,420
Hector been tryin' to fix that radio
since we got here.

800
01:07:10,459 --> 01:07:12,222
- Shh!
- What?

801
01:07:16,065 --> 01:07:17,657
<i>Arrive- damn-derci.</i>

802
01:07:23,005 --> 01:07:28,375
Hector. We gotta bail. Ask the old man
if he'll show us another way outta here.

803
01:07:28,411 --> 01:07:31,812
- Maybe we can reach the 366.
- We can't get five feet outta here

804
01:07:31,847 --> 01:07:34,645
without being flavor of the week
for the <i>Guten Tags.</i>

805
01:07:34,683 --> 01:07:38,642
These people survived for years
without mortars. Stay with the <i>paisans.</i>

806
01:07:38,687 --> 01:07:41,986
You wanna stay here and play house,
go ahead, but I'm bookin'.

807
01:07:42,024 --> 01:07:45,619
Ask the old man if he'll show us
another way outta these mountains.

808
01:07:45,661 --> 01:07:50,291
Tell him we'll pay him. We got plenty of
that funny money they use around here.

809
01:07:50,332 --> 01:07:52,493
Can you show us a safe path?

810
01:07:52,535 --> 01:07:54,400
There is no safe way.

811
01:07:54,437 --> 01:07:56,064
Germans. Boom! Boom!

812
01:07:56,415 --> 01:07:57,973
You know a way.

813
01:07:58,016 --> 01:08:01,213
Franco was the mailman,
ask him. I'm too old.

814
01:08:01,253 --> 01:08:04,620
Me? I have to deliver the mail.

815
01:08:04,656 --> 01:08:06,715
What mail, you old crazy fool?

816
01:08:06,759 --> 01:08:10,422
Old crazy fool? You're the old crazy,
like your mother and your father.

817
01:08:10,462 --> 01:08:12,692
- I know.
- You know?

818
01:08:12,731 --> 01:08:16,064
I know a way. I take you.

819
01:08:16,101 --> 01:08:17,568
What did you say?

820
01:08:19,838 --> 01:08:22,170
What did my daughter say?

821
01:08:22,207 --> 01:08:25,005
I have
nothing to do with this.

822
01:08:25,043 --> 01:08:27,739
Bishop. What you think?

823
01:08:27,780 --> 01:08:31,580
Little Red Riding Hood
lead us through the woods?

824
01:08:31,617 --> 01:08:34,085
I don't know, sarge.

825
01:08:34,119 --> 01:08:38,419
I mean, she fine. Man, she fine.

826
01:08:38,457 --> 01:08:42,484
I hear that they got
lady Mussolinis, too.

827
01:08:42,528 --> 01:08:44,496
Could be a trap.

828
01:08:47,099 --> 01:08:49,090
Hector.

829
01:08:49,134 --> 01:08:51,534
You the boss, staff sergeant.

830
01:08:51,570 --> 01:08:54,334
No good. No. No good.

831
01:08:55,774 --> 01:08:59,141
All of a sudden the old man
speaks some English, huh?

832
01:09:02,247 --> 01:09:03,737
Are you crazy in the head?

833
01:09:03,782 --> 01:09:05,181
Keep out of this.

834
01:09:06,051 --> 01:09:07,575
I forbid you to go.

835
01:09:07,619 --> 01:09:10,713
I don't need your permission.
Understand?

836
01:09:10,756 --> 01:09:12,951
You're still my daughter.

837
01:09:12,991 --> 01:09:16,950
Look, we'll find a way
outta here. Let's go.

838
01:09:28,907 --> 01:09:31,467
Bye-bye, <i>Americani.</i>

839
01:09:31,510 --> 01:09:33,478
Renata. Come away.

840
01:09:33,512 --> 01:09:34,706
No!

841
01:09:35,981 --> 01:09:38,211
Oh!

842
01:09:38,250 --> 01:09:42,152
Cigarette? Chocolate?

843
01:09:42,187 --> 01:09:43,916
Hell, no!

844
01:09:46,325 --> 01:09:47,849
Shove it up your ass.

845
01:09:49,962 --> 01:09:54,058
Sergeant Stamps out there
fussin' over what side to get back to.

846
01:09:54,099 --> 01:09:57,262
It don't mean nothin', boy.

847
01:09:57,302 --> 01:09:59,770
Me, I ain't got a side.

848
01:10:03,275 --> 01:10:06,972
Arturo said
that if you turn your head...

849
01:10:07,012 --> 01:10:08,604
it will be my birthday.

850
01:10:08,647 --> 01:10:12,708
I'll get toys and lots of candy.

851
01:10:12,751 --> 01:10:15,083
Now, please turn your head.

852
01:10:16,054 --> 01:10:18,045
Please turn your head.

853
01:10:19,658 --> 01:10:23,389
I can't understand your words, boy.

854
01:10:23,428 --> 01:10:25,328
But I don't need to.

855
01:10:25,364 --> 01:10:30,301
You see, everything you touch,
you brings good to it. You do.

856
01:10:31,703 --> 01:10:35,230
See this little thing here?
It'll make you invisible.

857
01:10:35,274 --> 01:10:40,974
Give you the strength of five people.
You ain't got to own nothin'.

858
01:10:41,013 --> 01:10:43,641
Ain't got to be a big somebody.

859
01:10:43,682 --> 01:10:47,277
All you got to do is believe in it, boy.

860
01:10:50,489 --> 01:10:52,480
Go on, boy. Go on.

861
01:10:57,496 --> 01:11:00,260
Can you turn
your head like this? See?

862
01:11:00,299 --> 01:11:03,996
God made this thing here
through man's hand.

863
01:11:04,036 --> 01:11:09,497
But the Lord gived it
shape and purpose.

864
01:11:09,541 --> 01:11:12,009
And through this little thing here,

865
01:11:12,044 --> 01:11:14,945
God gives you somethin' else, boy.

866
01:11:14,980 --> 01:11:18,746
You know what it is?
I'ma tell ya, I'ma tell ya.

867
01:11:18,784 --> 01:11:20,513
It's a secret.

868
01:11:21,620 --> 01:11:23,019
Miracles.

869
01:11:25,924 --> 01:11:27,755
Listen, Chocolate Giant.

870
01:11:27,793 --> 01:11:29,727
You've got to do what I say.

871
01:11:29,761 --> 01:11:32,559
Turn your head
so it will be my birthday.

872
01:11:32,598 --> 01:11:34,793
You want me
to stay eight forever?

873
01:11:36,335 --> 01:11:37,734
Turn your head.

874
01:11:38,937 --> 01:11:40,598
Arturo!

875
01:11:41,273 --> 01:11:43,605
Yes! I did it!

876
01:11:43,642 --> 01:11:45,132
I'm nine years old!

877
01:11:45,177 --> 01:11:47,941
Hey! Yes!

878
01:11:47,980 --> 01:11:49,675
Nine years old!

879
01:11:50,115 --> 01:11:51,707
Hurray!

880
01:11:51,750 --> 01:11:53,217
Nine years old!

881
01:11:53,251 --> 01:11:54,582
Boy, you got the spirit?

882
01:11:54,620 --> 01:11:57,214
I did it! Nine years old!

883
01:11:57,255 --> 01:12:00,713
You know up high, down low?
Gimme five.

884
01:12:00,759 --> 01:12:03,592
Gimme five. All right. All right.

885
01:12:03,629 --> 01:12:05,790
Up high.

886
01:12:07,532 --> 01:12:11,229
Up high, gimme five. OK.

887
01:12:11,269 --> 01:12:14,102
Gimme five. Gimme five.

888
01:12:14,139 --> 01:12:17,438
Up high. Down low.

889
01:12:17,476 --> 01:12:19,671
Down low. Too slow.

890
01:12:23,248 --> 01:12:25,512
You know that one? Gimme five.

891
01:12:25,550 --> 01:12:27,245
Up high.

892
01:12:27,285 --> 01:12:28,809
Down low.

893
01:12:28,854 --> 01:12:30,344
Too slow.

894
01:12:31,623 --> 01:12:33,887
Let's see if I got some chocolate here.

895
01:12:35,894 --> 01:12:37,589
You like chocolate?

896
01:12:39,898 --> 01:12:42,389
Yeah.

897
01:12:42,434 --> 01:12:43,901
How'd I get up here?

898
01:12:43,935 --> 01:12:47,393
The only place where
the Germans would not be

899
01:12:47,439 --> 01:12:50,738
is through the mountain
in Pietrasanta, Lucca.

900
01:12:50,776 --> 01:12:53,745
It's here. See?

901
01:12:53,779 --> 01:12:58,182
And that's where I think you
gonna find your people.

902
01:12:58,216 --> 01:13:01,481
- Here you go, Hector.
- Thanks, Train.

903
01:13:09,428 --> 01:13:10,827
Boy!

904
01:13:15,133 --> 01:13:17,260
How do you know?

905
01:13:17,302 --> 01:13:18,496
Is that true?

906
01:13:19,571 --> 01:13:21,596
Yeah, I know.

907
01:13:21,640 --> 01:13:22,971
Who are you talking to?

908
01:13:23,008 --> 01:13:25,135
- To Arturo.
- Arturo?

909
01:13:25,177 --> 01:13:26,201
Who's Arturo?

910
01:13:26,244 --> 01:13:27,575
My friend.

911
01:13:29,581 --> 01:13:30,980
And where is he?

912
01:13:32,250 --> 01:13:34,275
Over there, do you see?

913
01:13:34,319 --> 01:13:36,378
He's shy in front of other people.

914
01:13:46,698 --> 01:13:47,892
Hey.

915
01:14:16,361 --> 01:14:18,022
Arturo, what do you think?

916
01:14:18,630 --> 01:14:19,858
Shall we help him?

917
01:14:21,399 --> 01:14:23,162
<i>Three-seventy to Stamps.</i>

918
01:14:23,201 --> 01:14:24,828
We did it.

919
01:14:24,870 --> 01:14:27,361
<i>Three-seventy to Stamps.</i>

920
01:14:27,405 --> 01:14:30,374
Three-seventy to Stamps. Over.

921
01:14:34,346 --> 01:14:38,305
Three-seventy, this is Negron,
George Company, over.

922
01:14:38,350 --> 01:14:40,716
Got him, sir. I got the lost squad.

923
01:14:40,752 --> 01:14:42,447
Get up.

924
01:14:42,487 --> 01:14:47,151
- Stamps, you need to get in here!
- Hallelujah.

925
01:14:47,192 --> 01:14:49,592
I think the kid fixed the radio, man.

926
01:14:53,231 --> 01:14:55,927
- Who am I speaking with?
- Staff Sergeant Stamps.

927
01:14:55,967 --> 01:14:59,095
Staff Sergeant Stamps.
Send position, over.

928
01:14:59,137 --> 01:15:02,629
West of Borgo a Mozzano. We can see
the Mountain of the Sleeping Man.

929
01:15:02,674 --> 01:15:05,871
The Mount... The what?
Where's that in relation to here?

930
01:15:05,911 --> 01:15:08,379
West of the Serchio River someplace.
Over.

931
01:15:08,413 --> 01:15:11,382
Don't know how you got there,
we gonna make the most of it.

932
01:15:11,416 --> 01:15:14,214
- Seen any German sons of bitches?
- Have I seen any Krauts?

933
01:15:14,252 --> 01:15:16,880
No, motherfucker, just Cab
Calloway and his orchestra.

934
01:15:16,922 --> 01:15:18,321
Shh!

935
01:15:19,624 --> 01:15:22,058
Negative. But we think we're surrounded.

936
01:15:22,093 --> 01:15:25,460
Good. We want you to capture
a Nazi bastard. That's important.

937
01:15:25,497 --> 01:15:28,125
<i> We need to extract ASAP. Over.</i>

938
01:15:28,166 --> 01:15:32,603
Just get the Jerry and hold tight. That
is a direct order from General Almond.

939
01:15:32,637 --> 01:15:35,868
- <i> Hold tight with what? Over!</i>
- I just gave you an order.

940
01:15:35,907 --> 01:15:37,465
Now, you get that Jerry.

941
01:15:37,509 --> 01:15:42,105
<i>I will radio you</i>
<i>tomorrow at 0400.</i>

942
01:15:42,147 --> 01:15:45,981
And don't get yourself
shot up. Out.

943
01:15:48,119 --> 01:15:51,555
Fine. Bishop, follow me.

944
01:15:51,590 --> 01:15:52,887
Oh, man.

945
01:15:57,863 --> 01:15:59,558
This is a joke.

946
01:15:59,598 --> 01:16:02,590
First, your ace-boon-coon
giant goes off the deep end,

947
01:16:02,634 --> 01:16:05,933
now this God-and-country redneck
wants me to fetch a prisoner.

948
01:16:05,971 --> 01:16:09,338
- Something's cookin' around here.
- Thought you liked Nokes.

949
01:16:09,374 --> 01:16:12,275
- Who said I liked him?
- I seen you shinin' up to him.

950
01:16:12,310 --> 01:16:15,302
I ain't runnin' around
with sleeves cuffing poker cards

951
01:16:15,347 --> 01:16:18,407
don't mean I like Nokes.
Besides, he ain't the worst.

952
01:16:18,450 --> 01:16:21,112
The man left us high
and dry at the Serchio.

953
01:16:21,152 --> 01:16:24,952
Hear you tell it, you told the man
three times to fire that 105,

954
01:16:24,990 --> 01:16:27,356
- and he didn't.
- He ain't the first white man

955
01:16:27,392 --> 01:16:31,385
don't trust colored folks' word.
The knife cuts both ways, Bishop.

956
01:16:31,429 --> 01:16:33,954
Nokes reports to Driscoll.
Driscoll's fair.

957
01:16:33,999 --> 01:16:38,299
Shit, nigga, is you crazy? The only
reason white folks is thinkin' now

958
01:16:38,336 --> 01:16:41,669
about bein' fair in this Army
is Krauts is cuttin' their toenails

959
01:16:41,706 --> 01:16:44,231
too short and they runnin'
outta whites to die.

960
01:16:44,276 --> 01:16:46,574
Don't matter.
They said we couldn't fight.

961
01:16:46,611 --> 01:16:49,944
Had us float balloons, work as
quartermasters, cook and clean.

962
01:16:49,981 --> 01:16:52,916
The 92nd proved we can fight.
This is our country, too.

963
01:16:52,951 --> 01:16:56,352
We helped build it from the ground up.
I'm here for my children

964
01:16:56,388 --> 01:16:59,687
and future grandchildren,
Bishop! This is about progress!

965
01:16:59,724 --> 01:17:03,558
Nigga, please. Prog...

966
01:17:03,595 --> 01:17:05,586
You know what?

967
01:17:06,831 --> 01:17:10,562
Staff Sergeant,
you remember this progress?

968
01:17:12,904 --> 01:17:15,031
Mm-hm.

969
01:17:26,117 --> 01:17:28,881
- Tellin' you. Lena Horne.
- And Satchel Paige?

970
01:17:28,920 --> 01:17:31,286
Satchel Paige owe me $20.

971
01:17:31,323 --> 01:17:34,588
- You know 'em both?
- In and out.

972
01:17:34,626 --> 01:17:37,595
We only got an hour before
we gotta be back for maneuvers.

973
01:17:37,629 --> 01:17:41,463
Colonel Driscoll coming to
watch, too. Bishop, you hear me?

974
01:17:41,499 --> 01:17:43,091
I ain't studyin' Driscoll.

975
01:17:49,007 --> 01:17:50,565
Contest winner right there.

976
01:17:52,844 --> 01:17:55,074
- Afternoon, fellas.
- Howdy.

977
01:17:56,614 --> 01:17:58,844
See we got some
Krauts up in here.

978
01:17:58,883 --> 01:18:00,248
Soon we'll be
going back home.

979
01:18:00,285 --> 01:18:01,809
Nobody believes that.

980
01:18:01,853 --> 01:18:05,448
He just wants to visit
his girlfriend.

981
01:18:05,490 --> 01:18:07,981
- Yep.
- What do you boys want?

982
01:18:08,026 --> 01:18:10,620
No problem. We looking
for some good old ice slops.

983
01:18:10,662 --> 01:18:12,425
Go around back.
I'll get you some.

984
01:18:13,932 --> 01:18:14,956
Train.

985
01:18:17,902 --> 01:18:20,496
They went 'round back, too?

986
01:18:21,573 --> 01:18:23,939
Nigra, who I serve
is my damn business.

987
01:18:23,975 --> 01:18:26,136
Hitler's goose-steppers
you feeding.

988
01:18:26,177 --> 01:18:29,203
Want me to eat out a trough
in the backyard like I'm some pig?

989
01:18:29,247 --> 01:18:31,772
You want me to
shoot you in the head?

990
01:18:32,517 --> 01:18:33,677
Calm down!

991
01:18:33,718 --> 01:18:36,016
Put the goddamn gun down, Herb!

992
01:18:36,054 --> 01:18:39,353
- We're all Americans here.
- Whose side you on? Theirs or ours?

993
01:18:39,391 --> 01:18:42,986
- Respect the uniform.
- I'll tell you what, all right?

994
01:18:43,028 --> 01:18:46,054
- I'll pay for the damn ice slops.
- Whose side are you on?

995
01:18:46,097 --> 01:18:49,066
- You want this whole shop off-limits?
- Wish you'd try.

996
01:18:49,100 --> 01:18:51,330
We got the ice cream, guys.

997
01:18:51,369 --> 01:18:56,272
Suggest you boys find your way
back to base. You understand me?

998
01:18:56,307 --> 01:18:59,037
Get these Jerrys out quick.
Move, goddamn it, move!

999
01:18:59,077 --> 01:19:02,103
Get on your goddamn feet!
<i>Schnell,</i> goddamn it, <i>schnell!</i>

1000
01:19:02,147 --> 01:19:06,015
- I don't have all goddamn day!
- I don't have time for this shit.

1001
01:19:10,321 --> 01:19:12,812
Goddamn it!
Pick up your goddamn feet!

1002
01:19:12,857 --> 01:19:15,826
Didn't your <i>Fuhrer</i> teach
you how to march, boys? Move it!

1003
01:19:17,896 --> 01:19:22,299
What y'all niggers waiting on?
Y'all deaf nigras? Go on.

1004
01:19:22,333 --> 01:19:26,963
It's time for you to go.
Wanna get strung up? Go on!

1005
01:19:27,005 --> 01:19:30,941
It's whites only in here. You tell
your friends they're not welcome here.

1006
01:19:30,975 --> 01:19:34,502
You spread the news.
You big baboon! Go on, git!

1007
01:19:34,546 --> 01:19:36,411
Git!

1008
01:19:38,083 --> 01:19:42,417
- Stamps, what happened?
- Lucky this time.

1009
01:19:42,454 --> 01:19:45,184
Bishop? Where the ice slops?

1010
01:19:50,528 --> 01:19:54,487
There's a lesson for you, son.
That's how you treat these animals.

1011
01:19:54,532 --> 01:19:56,432
Mm-hm.

1012
01:20:52,123 --> 01:20:57,060
Between the nigra in uniform and free
yellow-bellied Japs running around,

1013
01:20:57,095 --> 01:21:00,087
country's gone to
hell in a handbasket.

1014
01:21:09,641 --> 01:21:12,109
- Put 'em down.
- Oh, shit.

1015
01:21:12,143 --> 01:21:16,239
Good afternoon. Look, you
cock-a-doodle-doo Bumfuck, Louisiana

1016
01:21:16,281 --> 01:21:19,944
motherfucker, I want my five
ice slops with a cherry on top.

1017
01:21:19,984 --> 01:21:22,418
Right there where you
served them Jerrys at.

1018
01:21:22,453 --> 01:21:24,546
- Sure.
- Wash your hands 'fore you serve

1019
01:21:24,589 --> 01:21:28,650
since you was likely yanking
those Krauts' cocks all morning.

1020
01:21:28,693 --> 01:21:32,026
Please, I got my wife and my son
here. Please, just take it easy.

1021
01:21:32,063 --> 01:21:34,088
We'll do whatever you like.

1022
01:21:34,132 --> 01:21:37,533
- It's OK.
- Stamps.

1023
01:21:37,569 --> 01:21:39,799
I changed my mind.
Make it to go.

1024
01:21:39,837 --> 01:21:43,204
I wouldn't get caught dead
eatin' in a shithole like this.

1025
01:21:43,241 --> 01:21:45,675
Vera? We got some paper cups
for these gentlemen?

1026
01:21:45,710 --> 01:21:47,678
- Come on, cracker.
- Just a second.

1027
01:21:47,712 --> 01:21:49,509
- Hurry up.
- How many are ya?

1028
01:21:49,547 --> 01:21:51,845
- Five.
- Five on the house.

1029
01:21:51,883 --> 01:21:53,350
Come on, boy, git!

1030
01:21:53,384 --> 01:21:55,909
- Cherries as well?
- I said cherries!

1031
01:21:55,954 --> 01:21:58,184
- Cherries it is.
- Hurry up.

1032
01:21:58,223 --> 01:22:00,783
Get the top
off of that for me.

1033
01:22:00,825 --> 01:22:04,261
- Now, come on, boy.
- As fast as I can here.

1034
01:22:38,096 --> 01:22:41,657
OK, boy. We got to
figure out a way to talk.

1035
01:22:41,699 --> 01:22:46,659
I got a cousin back home, can't
talk. So what he do is tap.

1036
01:22:46,704 --> 01:22:51,141
So what we'll do is tap. OK?

1037
01:22:51,175 --> 01:22:54,042
OK. Now, follow me.

1038
01:22:54,078 --> 01:22:57,878
One tap means "yes."

1039
01:22:57,915 --> 01:23:01,180
Two taps means "no."

1040
01:23:01,219 --> 01:23:07,055
Three taps means...
"try."

1041
01:23:07,925 --> 01:23:10,758
Four taps means...

1042
01:23:13,564 --> 01:23:18,160
...you sleepy.
Five taps means...

1043
01:23:19,437 --> 01:23:21,564
...you got to
take your medicine.

1044
01:23:23,408 --> 01:23:27,538
Six tap, this one
is real important, boy...

1045
01:23:30,615 --> 01:23:33,880
Boom! Boom!

1046
01:23:33,918 --> 01:23:36,580
It's danger. It's bad.
It's trouble.

1047
01:23:36,621 --> 01:23:39,818
- OK. One.
- Si.

1048
01:23:39,857 --> 01:23:43,258
- Two tap?
- No.

1049
01:23:43,294 --> 01:23:45,990
Three tap?

1050
01:23:47,432 --> 01:23:50,993
I don't quite understand, boy,
but I think you got it.

1051
01:23:51,035 --> 01:23:54,562
Four tap.

1052
01:23:54,605 --> 01:23:58,336
Ooh! Five tap.

1053
01:24:00,545 --> 01:24:04,140
OK, boy, it's only one more
left. You ready?

1054
01:24:04,182 --> 01:24:05,672
Six tap.

1055
01:24:07,719 --> 01:24:09,118
Boom! Boom!

1056
01:25:33,471 --> 01:25:35,132
Good. Good.

1057
01:25:35,173 --> 01:25:38,370
- You want to learn <i>italiano?</i>
- I'm trying.

1058
01:25:49,320 --> 01:25:54,053
- Renata, are you married?
- Yes.

1059
01:25:54,091 --> 01:25:58,027
His name is Vittorio.
Soldier like you.

1060
01:26:01,999 --> 01:26:07,699
You, Negroes, you're different
from other Americans.

1061
01:26:07,738 --> 01:26:11,139
Ain't no difference
in us, really.

1062
01:26:11,175 --> 01:26:14,804
No, we're just different
where it counts. That's all.

1063
01:26:14,846 --> 01:26:18,247
- What do you mean?
- Renata, baby,

1064
01:26:18,282 --> 01:26:21,911
let me put it to you this way.
If you ever, ever been colored

1065
01:26:21,953 --> 01:26:26,947
on a Harlem Saturday night, girl,
you wouldn't wanna be nothing else.

1066
01:26:26,991 --> 01:26:28,583
What does that mean?

1067
01:26:29,594 --> 01:26:30,993
Mm-hm.

1068
01:26:31,028 --> 01:26:34,589
- You should let me show you.
- Why you spreading foolishness?

1069
01:26:51,282 --> 01:26:54,445
- Where are you going?
- It smells in here.

1070
01:27:03,461 --> 01:27:05,156
You smoke, baby?

1071
01:27:05,196 --> 01:27:07,596
How about just one?

1072
01:27:08,900 --> 01:27:10,367
They're Camels.

1073
01:27:11,269 --> 01:27:13,635
<i>Americano cigarettos.</i>

1074
01:27:15,072 --> 01:27:16,266
Filterless.

1075
01:27:17,875 --> 01:27:19,638
Smooth taste.

1076
01:27:21,045 --> 01:27:22,512
Great value.

1077
01:27:24,916 --> 01:27:26,144
Go on, girl.

1078
01:27:27,251 --> 01:27:29,242
Should not smoke in church.

1079
01:27:31,722 --> 01:27:33,519
Mm-hm.

1080
01:27:43,234 --> 01:27:45,327
Hey, sarge.

1081
01:27:45,369 --> 01:27:48,896
- Any word from the radio?
- Yep. Snafu.

1082
01:27:48,940 --> 01:27:51,340
"Situation normal,
all fucked up."

1083
01:27:54,712 --> 01:27:58,341
Negroes like Bishop
set the race back 400 years.

1084
01:27:58,382 --> 01:28:03,115
He'd stick his limp,
light-skinned penis in a 88 if he could.

1085
01:28:03,154 --> 01:28:05,349
- He calls me a handkerchief head.
- What?

1086
01:28:05,389 --> 01:28:07,880
- An Uncle Tom.
- Hey, I don't...

1087
01:28:07,925 --> 01:28:10,826
I know. Puerto Ricans ain't
got nothing to do with it.

1088
01:28:10,861 --> 01:28:14,126
No, sir. I mean,
look, Bishop is Bishop.

1089
01:28:14,165 --> 01:28:17,225
For what it's worth,
you're doing a hell of a job out here.

1090
01:28:17,268 --> 01:28:20,203
- Something wrong here.
- Wrong with what?

1091
01:28:20,237 --> 01:28:22,967
Getting to love Italy.
I ain't a nigger here.

1092
01:28:23,007 --> 01:28:26,170
- I'm just me.
- Yeah. Same here.

1093
01:28:26,210 --> 01:28:28,269
These Italians is
catchin' holy hell,

1094
01:28:28,312 --> 01:28:30,678
but ain't studying
how to keep a Negro down.

1095
01:28:30,715 --> 01:28:34,845
I ain't never felt so free in my life.
Makes me feel ashamed to feel more free

1096
01:28:34,885 --> 01:28:37,046
in a foreign country
than I do in my own.

1097
01:28:38,756 --> 01:28:42,123
All my tomorrows was based on America
gettin' better. If it doesn't?

1098
01:28:42,159 --> 01:28:45,185
Just enjoy the night, my friend.

1099
01:28:45,229 --> 01:28:47,197
'Cause tomorrow may never come.

1100
01:28:47,231 --> 01:28:48,926
Hector. Come?

1101
01:28:49,634 --> 01:28:50,658
Sarge?

1102
01:28:55,272 --> 01:28:56,534
Thank you.

1103
01:28:58,209 --> 01:28:59,733
- Wine?
- Certainly.

1104
01:29:49,794 --> 01:29:51,659
What?

1105
01:29:51,696 --> 01:29:54,494
You have never seen
a woman's breasts before?

1106
01:30:01,739 --> 01:30:03,707
Renata, you're beautiful.

1107
01:30:04,875 --> 01:30:06,342
Thank you.

1108
01:30:20,024 --> 01:30:21,082
Who are you?

1109
01:30:21,125 --> 01:30:22,353
Who are you?

1110
01:30:22,393 --> 01:30:23,417
Who the fuck are you?

1111
01:30:23,461 --> 01:30:24,485
Partisans?

1112
01:30:24,528 --> 01:30:25,586
Who are you?

1113
01:30:25,629 --> 01:30:26,755
Partisans?

1114
01:30:31,168 --> 01:30:32,863
Come here! Come here!

1115
01:30:40,377 --> 01:30:41,844
Bastard!

1116
01:30:41,879 --> 01:30:43,107
Go! Go!

1117
01:30:46,183 --> 01:30:47,980
Fucking swine! Go!

1118
01:31:03,434 --> 01:31:05,265
- It's him, isn't it?
- Yes!

1119
01:31:05,302 --> 01:31:06,792
I knew he'd come back.

1120
01:31:09,573 --> 01:31:10,733
Everything's okay.

1121
01:31:10,775 --> 01:31:11,901
Tell them to put down
their arms.

1122
01:31:11,942 --> 01:31:15,241
- What do they want?
- Food.

1123
01:31:15,279 --> 01:31:17,110
- Americans?
- Yes.

1124
01:31:17,148 --> 01:31:20,675
- You know these boys?
- Yes.

1125
01:31:27,091 --> 01:31:28,183
Here's some bread.

1126
01:31:33,631 --> 01:31:35,121
Thank you.

1127
01:31:37,535 --> 01:31:38,832
Peppi.

1128
01:31:38,869 --> 01:31:40,131
Gianni.

1129
01:31:42,273 --> 01:31:43,900
Italo.

1130
01:31:43,941 --> 01:31:46,171
Hector,
where is their papers?

1131
01:31:46,210 --> 01:31:48,144
Your documents.

1132
01:31:51,849 --> 01:31:52,941
Read this.

1133
01:31:52,983 --> 01:31:54,678
We got a wise guy.

1134
01:32:00,891 --> 01:32:03,086
And I was running,
and I jumped...

1135
01:32:03,127 --> 01:32:05,254
Where were you, Train?

1136
01:32:05,296 --> 01:32:07,628
I took the boy out
for some fresh air.

1137
01:32:07,665 --> 01:32:11,226
We got a situation here,
soldier. Grab your rifle.

1138
01:32:13,170 --> 01:32:16,469
- Train, get your rifle now.
- What you want, boy?

1139
01:32:20,110 --> 01:32:21,907
Private, get your rifle!

1140
01:32:21,946 --> 01:32:25,313
We need to skedaddle outta here.
Hector, get on that radio.

1141
01:32:25,349 --> 01:32:28,250
Negative. We sit tight,
wait for Nokes to radio again.

1142
01:32:28,285 --> 01:32:30,753
- What is wrong with you?
- What he said to do.

1143
01:32:30,788 --> 01:32:33,882
No, he said get a Kraut prisoner.
We motherfuckin' got one.

1144
01:32:33,924 --> 01:32:36,859
He's sitting here eating
like a fucking butcher's dog.

1145
01:32:36,894 --> 01:32:39,419
- We gotta wait. His orders.
- You know, Stamps,

1146
01:32:39,463 --> 01:32:42,694
we can't sit with these wops
till one of these <i>signoras</i> decides

1147
01:32:42,733 --> 01:32:46,965
to give you some pussy.
Now, you had your chance last night.

1148
01:32:47,004 --> 01:32:49,199
I got a mind to take this out
and part your head with it.

1149
01:32:49,240 --> 01:32:51,902
Uh-uh. No.

1150
01:32:55,212 --> 01:32:56,474
Please.

1151
01:33:01,318 --> 01:33:02,615
What are they saying?

1152
01:33:02,653 --> 01:33:05,349
Those two have been fighting
since they got here.

1153
01:33:05,389 --> 01:33:09,689
- They want the German.
- We're holding the German, he's ours.

1154
01:33:09,727 --> 01:33:12,594
We'll interrogate him once
we find someone who speaks German.

1155
01:33:12,630 --> 01:33:15,428
He's their prisoner.
They're gonna interrogate,

1156
01:33:15,466 --> 01:33:18,731
- looking for somebody speaks German.
- We got plenty of people

1157
01:33:18,769 --> 01:33:21,465
back at headquarters. Come.
We'll get the job done.

1158
01:33:21,505 --> 01:33:24,770
At headquarters a lot
of people speak German. Let's go.

1159
01:33:24,808 --> 01:33:27,276
First, we ask him questions.

1160
01:33:27,311 --> 01:33:29,006
Then we'll turn him over.

1161
01:33:29,046 --> 01:33:32,641
They want answers, and until
they get 'em, he ain't going nowhere.

1162
01:33:32,683 --> 01:33:37,848
All right. I understand.

1163
01:33:37,888 --> 01:33:38,946
The hell with that!

1164
01:33:42,626 --> 01:33:44,150
Oh, shit!

1165
01:33:49,600 --> 01:33:52,728
Boy! Boy!

1166
01:34:00,110 --> 01:34:01,975
You're alive.

1167
01:34:02,012 --> 01:34:04,776
I told you to run and you made it.

1168
01:34:07,151 --> 01:34:09,381
Such a good Boy.

1169
01:34:10,087 --> 01:34:11,816
Such a good, clever Boy.

1170
01:34:13,657 --> 01:34:15,716
Just like my little brother, Ulrich.

1171
01:34:16,894 --> 01:34:19,328
You even have the same hair.

1172
01:34:20,831 --> 01:34:23,163
You have to listen little brother.

1173
01:34:24,034 --> 01:34:25,228
Listen closely.

1174
01:34:26,737 --> 01:34:28,728
You've got to run again.

1175
01:34:29,773 --> 01:34:31,331
Get away.

1176
01:34:31,375 --> 01:34:34,640
Talking too much.
I told you we should have killed him.

1177
01:34:36,313 --> 01:34:37,905
Do you understand? Run.

1178
01:34:37,948 --> 01:34:39,108
Run again.

1179
01:34:39,149 --> 01:34:40,411
Run as fast as you can.

1180
01:34:40,451 --> 01:34:41,679
Shut up!

1181
01:34:43,187 --> 01:34:45,883
Get on the radio!
We got a German prisoner!

1182
01:34:45,923 --> 01:34:48,983
Three seventy, this is George
Company. We have a German.

1183
01:34:49,026 --> 01:34:51,051
I repeat, we have a German. Over.

1184
01:34:51,095 --> 01:34:54,394
<i> George Company,</i>
<i>stay put. We'll get back to you. Out.</i>

1185
01:34:54,431 --> 01:34:55,796
Roger. Out.

1186
01:34:57,901 --> 01:34:59,766
So, how did you get lights?

1187
01:35:02,539 --> 01:35:03,801
I don't know.

1188
01:35:05,175 --> 01:35:06,699
It was a Miracle.

1189
01:35:06,744 --> 01:35:09,838
Do you know what
the real Miracle is?

1190
01:35:09,880 --> 01:35:11,438
Is that you're still alive.

1191
01:35:43,680 --> 01:35:45,944
Train, Nokes is coming.

1192
01:35:45,983 --> 01:35:48,383
He's comin' himself.

1193
01:35:48,419 --> 01:35:52,480
Something goin' on, Hec.
Something bad.

1194
01:35:53,390 --> 01:35:57,258
Nobody think the boy see nothin'.

1195
01:35:57,294 --> 01:35:59,421
But he sees it all.

1196
01:36:02,166 --> 01:36:04,066
I know, big guy.

1197
01:36:04,101 --> 01:36:06,626
That I know.

1198
01:36:06,670 --> 01:36:09,969
You think I gotta give him back
when the captain comes?

1199
01:36:11,708 --> 01:36:16,372
I know how close you are to him,
Train, but that's not my call.

1200
01:36:16,413 --> 01:36:18,244
I need to talk to him now.

1201
01:36:21,285 --> 01:36:23,685
- Go on.
- Thank you.

1202
01:36:26,290 --> 01:36:28,087
So,

1203
01:36:28,125 --> 01:36:30,093
how are you feeling?

1204
01:36:30,127 --> 01:36:31,151
Want a chocolate?

1205
01:36:32,329 --> 01:36:33,353
It's good.

1206
01:36:37,434 --> 01:36:39,061
I need your help.

1207
01:36:44,441 --> 01:36:47,171
- Train?
- Hey, boy.

1208
01:36:53,984 --> 01:36:55,474
What's your name?

1209
01:36:56,453 --> 01:36:58,944
Angelo. Angelo Torancelli.

1210
01:36:59,923 --> 01:37:02,118
Me, I'm Hector.

1211
01:37:02,893 --> 01:37:04,292
Where are you from?

1212
01:37:04,328 --> 01:37:06,387
From St. Anna di Stazzema.

1213
01:37:07,698 --> 01:37:09,165
Angelo...

1214
01:37:09,199 --> 01:37:10,860
that German...

1215
01:37:10,901 --> 01:37:11,925
do you know him?

1216
01:37:13,137 --> 01:37:16,402
Yes. There were a lot of them.

1217
01:37:17,541 --> 01:37:19,805
What did he tell you just now?

1218
01:37:19,843 --> 01:37:22,539
He told me what he told me before.

1219
01:37:22,579 --> 01:37:25,047
He told me to run as fast as I can.

1220
01:37:25,082 --> 01:37:26,140
When?

1221
01:37:26,183 --> 01:37:29,675
Before. At the fire. At the Church.

1222
01:37:31,421 --> 01:37:33,582
What fire?

1223
01:37:36,160 --> 01:37:37,855
Angelo.

1224
01:37:37,895 --> 01:37:39,795
Your father and your mother...

1225
01:37:39,830 --> 01:37:41,798
Where is your father and your mother?

1226
01:37:47,804 --> 01:37:51,433
- Oh, Hec, leave him be.
- Train, please.

1227
01:37:51,475 --> 01:37:53,306
Just one more thing.

1228
01:37:58,115 --> 01:38:00,049
Why are you
so afraid of him?

1229
01:38:00,083 --> 01:38:02,074
I'm not afraid of him.

1230
01:38:02,119 --> 01:38:03,643
He's my friend.

1231
01:38:03,687 --> 01:38:05,382
I'm afraid of the other one.

1232
01:38:05,422 --> 01:38:06,480
What other one?

1233
01:38:35,419 --> 01:38:36,784
Murderer!

1234
01:38:36,820 --> 01:38:38,014
- Nazi! Dirty pig!
- Burn in hell!

1235
01:38:38,055 --> 01:38:39,579
Send that son of a whore out here!

1236
01:38:39,623 --> 01:38:41,181
Get back!

1237
01:38:41,225 --> 01:38:42,590
We'll rip his eyes out!

1238
01:38:42,626 --> 01:38:44,093
Butterfly!

1239
01:38:48,332 --> 01:38:49,526
Who threw that?

1240
01:38:52,336 --> 01:38:53,462
Give him to us!

1241
01:38:53,503 --> 01:38:54,527
We want him now!

1242
01:39:02,813 --> 01:39:03,973
Go, go, go!

1243
01:39:05,282 --> 01:39:07,614
You have two days. No more. Tell them!

1244
01:39:07,651 --> 01:39:09,448
He says you have two days. No more.

1245
01:39:09,486 --> 01:39:10,885
He'll stay here.

1246
01:39:10,921 --> 01:39:13,412
He will leave his man.

1247
01:39:17,094 --> 01:39:19,528
- Where's he goin'?
- I don't know.

1248
01:39:19,563 --> 01:39:21,793
I need
another pair of eyes.

1249
01:39:21,832 --> 01:39:25,233
- When is Nokes comin'?
- Soon. He's comin' himself.

1250
01:39:25,269 --> 01:39:27,134
- It's time that we all go.
- Where?

1251
01:39:28,405 --> 01:39:30,873
Excuse me.
Can we have a moment?

1252
01:39:33,510 --> 01:39:35,341
Train's kid. All right?

1253
01:39:35,379 --> 01:39:38,871
He's talkin' that he's seen a church,
a fire, the Italian guy.

1254
01:39:38,915 --> 01:39:41,008
Which church, fire? Which Italian guy?

1255
01:39:41,051 --> 01:39:44,145
I don't know. He's seen something bad,
he's definitely seen him.

1256
01:39:44,187 --> 01:39:45,882
I seen him, too. So what?

1257
01:39:45,922 --> 01:39:47,787
The kid hasn't talked in days.

1258
01:39:47,824 --> 01:39:50,122
All of a sudden he sees
him and he's talkin'?

1259
01:39:50,160 --> 01:39:52,628
- It ain't right.
- That's just skippy,

1260
01:39:52,663 --> 01:39:55,427
but I ain't got time
to talk to him right now.

1261
01:39:55,465 --> 01:39:57,399
You, come here.

1262
01:39:57,434 --> 01:40:00,426
Gather who will come,
we'll take 'em down the mountain.

1263
01:40:00,470 --> 01:40:02,267
- We do not come with you.
- Why not?

1264
01:40:02,306 --> 01:40:04,536
- Nazis in all villages.
- Yeah. Boom, boom.

1265
01:40:04,574 --> 01:40:07,065
Sit tight and it'll
be jingle bells real soon.

1266
01:40:07,110 --> 01:40:09,203
The U.S. Army's sittin' in front of you.

1267
01:40:09,246 --> 01:40:12,477
We need Army inside house now!
Three years we've been waiting.

1268
01:40:12,516 --> 01:40:16,179
First the British, then the Americans.
Italy is tired to wait.

1269
01:40:17,187 --> 01:40:20,315
Let's talk to your partisan.

1270
01:40:20,357 --> 01:40:23,417
Ask your friend to climb the
ridge and tell us what he sees.

1271
01:40:23,460 --> 01:40:26,395
He wants you
to go up the Mountain...

1272
01:40:26,430 --> 01:40:27,692
and tell us what you see.

1273
01:40:27,731 --> 01:40:29,164
Come on.

1274
01:40:43,547 --> 01:40:46,744
- I don't trust that guy.
- He's a good man.

1275
01:40:46,783 --> 01:40:49,547
He's a partisan. He's from this valley.

1276
01:40:49,586 --> 01:40:52,453
- She grew up with him.
- Yeah. OK. Great.

1277
01:40:52,489 --> 01:40:56,858
I don't care if he's Frank Sinatra
or Joltin' Joe DiMaggio himself.

1278
01:40:56,893 --> 01:40:59,953
Somethin' about his eyes
I just don't trust.

1279
01:41:14,344 --> 01:41:16,642
Mm-hm.

1280
01:42:04,895 --> 01:42:07,420
G.I. G.I. G.I.

1281
01:42:08,865 --> 01:42:11,425
Hey! Alessio!

1282
01:42:11,468 --> 01:42:15,165
You ring that motherfuckin' bell
you see Hitler!

1283
01:42:15,205 --> 01:42:17,366
I got more of this
Hershey's for ya!

1284
01:42:18,742 --> 01:42:21,734
G.I. G.I. G.I.

1285
01:42:35,292 --> 01:42:36,316
Well?

1286
01:42:37,494 --> 01:42:38,552
Is it safe?

1287
01:42:39,696 --> 01:42:41,630
Yes, it's safe. Yes.

1288
01:42:41,665 --> 01:42:42,723
Good.

1289
01:42:42,766 --> 01:42:45,098
- Is it good?
- It's safe.

1290
01:42:45,135 --> 01:42:46,602
Here, take your Kraut.

1291
01:42:46,636 --> 01:42:48,069
Come with me.

1292
01:42:48,104 --> 01:42:49,662
Go.

1293
01:42:49,706 --> 01:42:52,300
- Hector, watch both of them.
- Gladly.

1294
01:42:52,976 --> 01:42:54,341
After you.

1295
01:42:57,814 --> 01:42:59,509
What's that?

1296
01:42:59,549 --> 01:43:01,540
I don't understand Spanish.

1297
01:43:01,585 --> 01:43:03,109
What is that?

1298
01:43:03,153 --> 01:43:04,211
A cigarette.

1299
01:43:04,254 --> 01:43:06,654
No, that's not a cigarette.

1300
01:43:07,858 --> 01:43:09,257
American cigarettes.

1301
01:43:11,027 --> 01:43:12,654
Good.

1302
01:43:12,696 --> 01:43:13,924
Very good.

1303
01:43:17,767 --> 01:43:19,029
What's your name?

1304
01:43:19,936 --> 01:43:21,096
Rodolfo.

1305
01:43:21,137 --> 01:43:22,764
Hector.

1306
01:43:22,806 --> 01:43:26,503
Men, take a knee and bow.

1307
01:43:28,612 --> 01:43:30,204
God Almighty.

1308
01:43:30,247 --> 01:43:33,114
The tree of life blossoms
beside the shore of still waters.

1309
01:43:33,149 --> 01:43:38,451
The face of Christ is shining,
and it needs no candle, no light...

1310
01:43:38,488 --> 01:43:40,752
Nor Sun.

1311
01:43:40,790 --> 01:43:43,384
There is no suffering in your Kingdom.

1312
01:43:43,426 --> 01:43:46,486
And we ask for your forgiveness
merciful Father...

1313
01:43:46,530 --> 01:43:49,363
that we have not seen
the light before this day.

1314
01:43:49,399 --> 01:43:51,492
For your light reigns forever.

1315
01:43:51,535 --> 01:43:54,163
It is a shining beacon that lights
the path to your heavenly throne.

1316
01:43:54,204 --> 01:43:57,469
I may not be the man
that you want me to be, O Lord.

1317
01:43:57,507 --> 01:44:00,340
I may not be the man that
I should have been, O God.

1318
01:44:00,377 --> 01:44:02,311
But we are your people.

1319
01:44:02,345 --> 01:44:06,975
We ask you, Lord, to walk
with us in our pain and our suffering.

1320
01:44:07,017 --> 01:44:09,850
...as a nation of your children
who glorify your name...

1321
01:44:09,886 --> 01:44:11,444
in victory.

1322
01:44:11,488 --> 01:44:13,718
- Amen.
- Amen.

1323
01:44:13,757 --> 01:44:15,156
Amen.

1324
01:44:25,201 --> 01:44:26,395
Amen.

1325
01:44:31,675 --> 01:44:33,905
Easy, boy.

1326
01:44:33,944 --> 01:44:37,710
Ain't got to go jumpin'
every hank and rustle come along.

1327
01:44:37,747 --> 01:44:39,874
Here. Go on.

1328
01:44:39,916 --> 01:44:41,508
Yeah.

1329
01:44:46,323 --> 01:44:50,020
Hey. You, uh...

1330
01:44:50,060 --> 01:44:54,429
You still tryin' to hump
that piece of shit off on somebody?

1331
01:44:54,464 --> 01:44:57,831
You ought not use them type
of bad words around the boy, Bishop.

1332
01:44:59,469 --> 01:45:01,630
Shit.

1333
01:45:01,671 --> 01:45:03,605
He don't understand.

1334
01:45:05,308 --> 01:45:07,299
Go on inside, boy. Go on.

1335
01:45:11,348 --> 01:45:14,875
How about all that preachin'
you do back home, Bishop?

1336
01:45:14,918 --> 01:45:17,011
Don't you believe in God?

1337
01:45:20,957 --> 01:45:24,085
Well, now, I believes in it
at the time I'm preachin' it.

1338
01:45:25,695 --> 01:45:27,890
Then I don't believe in it no more.

1339
01:45:30,734 --> 01:45:35,103
Hell, now I just believe in the pictures
of old white men on green paper.

1340
01:45:35,138 --> 01:45:37,629
Well, that ain't no way to live.

1341
01:45:37,674 --> 01:45:39,938
You know, God don't like ugly, Bishop.

1342
01:45:39,976 --> 01:45:42,444
He ain't too fond of pretty, either.

1343
01:45:47,951 --> 01:45:50,351
Train, why you think...

1344
01:45:50,387 --> 01:45:54,483
Why you think God allow all this killin'
all over the world to happen?

1345
01:45:54,524 --> 01:45:56,651
Hmm?

1346
01:46:01,898 --> 01:46:04,230
See?

1347
01:46:04,267 --> 01:46:06,758
See, that's why I don't believe in him.

1348
01:46:10,507 --> 01:46:13,908
Well, if you don't believe in
him, Bishop Cummings, then...

1349
01:46:13,943 --> 01:46:17,936
...why you care about whether or not God
the one allowin' all the killin'?

1350
01:46:25,055 --> 01:46:26,613
Man...

1351
01:46:27,924 --> 01:46:30,256
Man, you startin' to sound
like my mama now.

1352
01:46:31,828 --> 01:46:34,194
Your mama alive, Bishop?

1353
01:46:34,230 --> 01:46:39,190
Train, mind your own goddamn business,
boy. You hear me?

1354
01:46:39,235 --> 01:46:42,796
Yeah, I'm sorry, buddy.
I didn't, uh...

1355
01:46:42,839 --> 01:46:45,171
I didn't mean nothin'
by it, Bishop.

1356
01:46:45,208 --> 01:46:49,338
Is your God gonna get us
back home? In one piece?

1357
01:46:49,379 --> 01:46:52,348
Is he?

1358
01:46:54,084 --> 01:46:56,917
If the Lord is willin'
and the creek don't rise.

1359
01:47:02,392 --> 01:47:04,758
Hey, Renata.

1360
01:47:08,932 --> 01:47:12,959
- Where you headed?
- Your boss wants you.

1361
01:47:13,002 --> 01:47:16,733
Nah. Nah, no boss, OK?

1362
01:47:19,776 --> 01:47:22,006
Girl, let me trim your garden.

1363
01:47:24,848 --> 01:47:27,078
What do you mean?

1364
01:47:27,117 --> 01:47:30,518
<i>Signora,</i> shakin' hands with you
is like touchin' a flamethrower.

1365
01:47:32,288 --> 01:47:36,122
You fine as wine and as silk as milk.

1366
01:47:41,231 --> 01:47:45,361
You like dancin'? You like jazz?

1367
01:47:46,736 --> 01:47:50,695
- You ever heard of Count Basie?
- Count of Basie?

1368
01:47:52,542 --> 01:47:53,600
Where is this?

1369
01:47:55,011 --> 01:47:56,876
Mm-hm.

1370
01:48:26,075 --> 01:48:28,305
Want a Camel cigarette?

1371
01:48:30,547 --> 01:48:31,980
Come in.

1372
01:49:16,259 --> 01:49:19,592
You didn't know that the Germans
raised the price on your head.

1373
01:49:19,629 --> 01:49:21,961
From 50,000 lire to 100,000 lire...

1374
01:49:21,998 --> 01:49:23,397
and a bag of salt.

1375
01:49:23,433 --> 01:49:24,832
Not bad!

1376
01:49:26,302 --> 01:49:31,069
But you saw, no one
from the village turned you in.

1377
01:49:32,308 --> 01:49:35,072
Not even
the Fascist Ludovico...

1378
01:49:35,111 --> 01:49:38,342
who's so stingy he keeps his money
in his underpants.

1379
01:49:38,381 --> 01:49:39,507
Not even Ludovico?

1380
01:49:40,617 --> 01:49:41,845
Not even Ludovico.

1381
01:49:41,885 --> 01:49:43,682
If they only knew who I am,

1382
01:49:45,288 --> 01:49:47,085
what I've done,

1383
01:49:49,893 --> 01:49:52,054
they'd pull my heart out of my chest.

1384
01:49:52,762 --> 01:49:53,854
Peppi.

1385
01:49:56,599 --> 01:49:59,227
What's tormenting you so much?

1386
01:49:59,269 --> 01:50:01,396
We surprised a German Patrol...

1387
01:50:01,437 --> 01:50:04,338
My little son Robert loves the rain.

1388
01:50:04,374 --> 01:50:06,308
My little Anna hates it.

1389
01:50:06,342 --> 01:50:07,741
Shut up you two!

1390
01:50:07,777 --> 01:50:08,835
Yes, Sir.

1391
01:50:17,553 --> 01:50:19,384
Where are you going?

1392
01:50:19,422 --> 01:50:20,889
Where are you going?

1393
01:50:25,328 --> 01:50:26,420
I'll slaughter you.

1394
01:50:30,934 --> 01:50:32,401
Do you hear me?

1395
01:50:32,435 --> 01:50:34,528
Do you hear me?
I'll slaughter you.

1396
01:50:38,341 --> 01:50:40,400
How many times do you
want to kill him?

1397
01:50:41,945 --> 01:50:43,640
He's already dead.

1398
01:50:57,126 --> 01:50:58,821
Look what I found.

1399
01:50:59,696 --> 01:51:00,822
Here.

1400
01:51:00,863 --> 01:51:02,660
I'll keep this
for my family.

1401
01:51:02,699 --> 01:51:03,996
My daughter is hungry.

1402
01:51:04,033 --> 01:51:06,092
At least
I can give her food.

1403
01:51:06,135 --> 01:51:07,159
Take this.

1404
01:51:09,572 --> 01:51:11,631
This money is
stained with blood.

1405
01:51:12,809 --> 01:51:14,572
We're suppose
to catch the thieves...

1406
01:51:14,610 --> 01:51:16,237
not become them.

1407
01:51:16,279 --> 01:51:18,213
Let's not start a war
between ourselves.

1408
01:51:18,247 --> 01:51:20,841
What's that got to do with it?

1409
01:51:20,883 --> 01:51:22,475
I gave you
three years of blood.

1410
01:51:22,518 --> 01:51:23,746
To Italy and to him.

1411
01:51:23,786 --> 01:51:25,276
Three years of blood.

1412
01:51:25,321 --> 01:51:28,882
You're a Fascist and you'll
always be one, like Marco.

1413
01:51:28,925 --> 01:51:29,949
Here.

1414
01:51:29,993 --> 01:51:31,893
Take your money and go home.

1415
01:51:31,928 --> 01:51:33,828
I will take it home.

1416
01:51:36,933 --> 01:51:38,332
I will take it.

1417
01:51:39,068 --> 01:51:40,194
Go, go, go.

1418
01:51:40,236 --> 01:51:41,726
Go!

1419
01:51:55,018 --> 01:51:56,451
It's finished here.

1420
01:51:59,288 --> 01:52:01,620
You'll pay for this.

1421
01:52:04,027 --> 01:52:06,154
The Germans were blinded by rage.

1422
01:52:06,195 --> 01:52:08,959
We had been attacking
them for months. They were furious.

1423
01:52:09,999 --> 01:52:12,661
They combed the mountains
looking for us.

1424
01:52:12,702 --> 01:52:13,999
We had to hide.

1425
01:52:14,037 --> 01:52:15,368
We could have starved to death.

1426
01:52:22,712 --> 01:52:25,044
Nobody there.

1427
01:52:25,081 --> 01:52:27,174
A fellow Partisan saved us.

1428
01:52:27,216 --> 01:52:29,081
Paselli was her name.

1429
01:52:49,972 --> 01:52:52,839
She was the one who told me what
happened at St. Anna di Stazzema.

1430
01:52:53,776 --> 01:52:56,074
- Eat.
- Thank you.

1431
01:52:56,112 --> 01:52:57,977
I had sent the others to Serravezza.

1432
01:52:58,014 --> 01:53:01,108
I had to meet one of our men
who had gone to look for supplies.

1433
01:53:03,853 --> 01:53:06,219
But then, because of the storm,
I had to stay in the mountains.

1434
01:53:06,255 --> 01:53:08,985
They marched into St. Anna.

1435
01:53:09,025 --> 01:53:12,324
They gathered hundreds of people,

1436
01:53:12,361 --> 01:53:14,192
- women,
- children,

1437
01:53:14,230 --> 01:53:15,561
children and old people.

1438
01:53:18,434 --> 01:53:19,992
There were also refugees.

1439
01:53:20,036 --> 01:53:22,504
They grouped them in the Square.

1440
01:53:22,538 --> 01:53:23,937
In front of the Church.

1441
01:53:26,943 --> 01:53:29,036
One of you...

1442
01:53:30,947 --> 01:53:32,608
knows...

1443
01:53:32,648 --> 01:53:35,276
where he is.

1444
01:53:36,319 --> 01:53:38,549
One of you...

1445
01:53:40,490 --> 01:53:42,151
has seen...

1446
01:53:42,191 --> 01:53:43,215
him.

1447
01:53:45,061 --> 01:53:46,085
So...

1448
01:53:48,064 --> 01:53:49,429
speak.

1449
01:53:53,369 --> 01:53:54,961
Everyone's quiet.

1450
01:54:00,076 --> 01:54:01,475
They don't know anything.

1451
01:54:01,511 --> 01:54:02,808
They're innocent.

1452
01:54:02,845 --> 01:54:03,971
They don't know anything.

1453
01:54:04,013 --> 01:54:06,481
I gave you fifteen minutes...

1454
01:54:06,516 --> 01:54:07,949
They're innocent.

1455
01:54:07,984 --> 01:54:11,818
to find someone who would tell us...

1456
01:54:11,854 --> 01:54:13,219
They don't know.

1457
01:54:13,256 --> 01:54:16,419
where is the hideout of the Butterfly?

1458
01:54:16,459 --> 01:54:18,017
- They don't know.
- And his Bandits.

1459
01:54:18,060 --> 01:54:19,721
Take only my life.

1460
01:54:19,762 --> 01:54:20,854
I beg you.

1461
01:54:20,897 --> 01:54:23,764
You still have one minute.

1462
01:54:33,109 --> 01:54:34,133
Kneel.

1463
01:54:36,045 --> 01:54:38,240
In the name of the Father...

1464
01:54:38,281 --> 01:54:39,578
And the Son...

1465
01:54:39,615 --> 01:54:41,480
and the Holy Ghost.

1466
01:54:43,286 --> 01:54:45,914
Our Father who art in Heaven,

1467
01:54:45,955 --> 01:54:48,480
hallowed be Thy name,

1468
01:54:48,524 --> 01:54:50,321
Thy Kingdom come,

1469
01:54:50,359 --> 01:54:52,520
Thy will be done,

1470
01:54:54,130 --> 01:54:55,495
On Earth...

1471
01:54:55,531 --> 01:54:57,999
as it is in Heaven.

1472
01:54:58,034 --> 01:55:01,333
Give us this day our daily bread.

1473
01:55:01,370 --> 01:55:04,339
Forgive us for our trespasses,

1474
01:55:04,373 --> 01:55:06,841
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

1475
01:55:07,743 --> 01:55:10,735
Lead us not into temptation.

1476
01:55:10,780 --> 01:55:12,873
But deliver us from Evil.

1477
01:55:13,616 --> 01:55:16,346
- Amen.
- Amen.

1478
01:55:16,385 --> 01:55:17,647
I understand.

1479
01:55:17,687 --> 01:55:19,621
- Is there something?
- Yes, Sir...

1480
01:55:19,655 --> 01:55:22,021
There are orders from headquarters.

1481
01:55:23,059 --> 01:55:24,083
Yes?

1482
01:55:26,062 --> 01:55:27,086
It will be done.

1483
01:55:51,187 --> 01:55:52,245
Father.

1484
01:55:52,989 --> 01:55:54,286
Forgive them...

1485
01:55:54,323 --> 01:55:56,120
for they know not what they do.

1486
01:56:54,684 --> 01:56:55,878
They...

1487
01:56:55,918 --> 01:56:59,820
killed so many,

1488
01:57:01,257 --> 01:57:03,020
that they ran out of ammunition.

1489
01:57:27,717 --> 01:57:29,275
They burnt so many...

1490
01:57:30,319 --> 01:57:33,379
they ran out of fuel.

1491
01:57:36,359 --> 01:57:38,452
What has happened here...

1492
01:57:41,230 --> 01:57:43,460
everything that's happened...

1493
01:57:44,800 --> 01:57:47,166
is your fault.

1494
01:57:47,203 --> 01:57:50,695
You promised to bring The Butterfly.

1495
01:57:50,740 --> 01:57:52,833
- He told me he would be here.
- No. No. I don't care!

1496
01:57:52,875 --> 01:57:54,570
- I know these people.
- You will pay for this!

1497
01:57:54,610 --> 01:57:56,441
They have nothing to do with it.

1498
01:57:56,479 --> 01:57:58,777
Rodolfo, we had a deal.

1499
01:57:58,814 --> 01:58:00,611
No, I kept my deal.

1500
01:58:00,649 --> 01:58:02,310
I brought him here.

1501
01:58:02,351 --> 01:58:06,185
But you promised me,
my dear Rodolfo.

1502
01:58:06,222 --> 01:58:07,780
You Italians don't know
how to keep a deal.

1503
01:58:07,823 --> 01:58:10,417
I betrayed my people.
I'll burn in Hell because of you.

1504
01:58:10,459 --> 01:58:13,895
You worthless Italians.

1505
01:58:13,929 --> 01:58:15,863
You will pay for this!

1506
01:58:15,898 --> 01:58:17,593
All of you Italians will pay for this!

1507
01:58:17,633 --> 01:58:19,601
Mama!

1508
01:58:19,635 --> 01:58:20,761
Mama!

1509
01:58:20,803 --> 01:58:22,134
Mama!

1510
01:58:22,171 --> 01:58:23,798
Arturo! Arturo!

1511
01:58:23,839 --> 01:58:25,067
No!

1512
01:58:25,107 --> 01:58:27,041
No! Stop! Stop!

1513
01:58:27,076 --> 01:58:28,304
Run! Run!

1514
01:58:28,344 --> 01:58:29,368
Run!

1515
01:58:29,412 --> 01:58:30,436
Run!

1516
01:58:31,647 --> 01:58:32,671
Child murderer!

1517
01:58:41,457 --> 01:58:42,947
Bloody traitor!

1518
01:58:44,660 --> 01:58:46,389
Come on!

1519
01:58:46,429 --> 01:58:47,760
Move!

1520
01:58:47,797 --> 01:58:49,196
Move! Move! Move!

1521
01:58:56,138 --> 01:58:57,605
Bring him back!

1522
01:58:59,275 --> 01:59:00,299
Go!

1523
01:59:07,817 --> 01:59:09,284
Finish him!

1524
01:59:09,318 --> 01:59:10,808
Kill him!

1525
01:59:15,024 --> 01:59:17,151
Move, move.
We can't go back without him.

1526
01:59:21,197 --> 01:59:22,459
Where's that swine?

1527
01:59:22,498 --> 01:59:23,522
Over there.

1528
01:59:31,006 --> 01:59:33,531
Even if
I live a hundred years...

1529
01:59:33,576 --> 01:59:35,510
I've been dead from that day on.

1530
01:59:35,544 --> 01:59:36,943
Peppi.

1531
01:59:39,515 --> 01:59:42,245
You need a lot more courage
to live than to die.

1532
01:59:43,519 --> 01:59:46,454
But listen to me.

1533
01:59:46,489 --> 01:59:48,753
You have to accept the truth.

1534
01:59:48,791 --> 01:59:51,760
Someone betrayed you.

1535
01:59:51,794 --> 01:59:54,991
And you have to find the traitor.

1536
01:59:57,066 --> 01:59:58,624
Only thing I know...

1537
02:00:00,603 --> 02:00:04,130
The Germans were wrong
to provoke The Sleeping Man.

1538
02:00:05,774 --> 02:00:07,537
Because, you'll see...

1539
02:00:07,576 --> 02:00:08,668
In the end,

1540
02:00:08,711 --> 02:00:10,338
he'll protect us.

1541
02:00:11,447 --> 02:00:13,142
He'll protect his land.

1542
02:00:23,125 --> 02:00:24,683
I'm done.

1543
02:00:26,262 --> 02:00:28,196
I shit on Hitler's mother.

1544
02:00:32,768 --> 02:00:36,864
If I were in San Juan,
I'd eat a good plate of rice and beans.

1545
02:00:36,906 --> 02:00:38,635
And a sweetie pie for dessert.

1546
02:00:54,356 --> 02:00:55,482
Who is he?

1547
02:00:56,692 --> 02:00:58,717
I'll meet that swine...

1548
02:00:59,261 --> 02:01:01,422
in Hell.

1549
02:01:01,463 --> 02:01:02,862
I don't understand.

1550
02:01:08,137 --> 02:01:09,934
No, no, no. Come on.

1551
02:01:35,998 --> 02:01:38,023
Where's the German?

1552
02:01:38,067 --> 02:01:42,663
The Americans took him
and they kicked me out. I told you so.

1553
02:01:44,974 --> 02:01:47,772
We have to get out of here right away.

1554
02:01:47,810 --> 02:01:51,041
It's full of Germans making their way
down The Sleeping Man.

1555
02:01:51,080 --> 02:01:52,809
The Germans have lost, everyone knows.

1556
02:01:52,848 --> 02:01:55,817
What are you talking about?
He who made the mistake must pay.

1557
02:01:55,851 --> 02:01:56,909
Rodolfo...

1558
02:01:56,952 --> 02:01:59,580
Ludovico's not the traitor anyway.

1559
02:02:00,723 --> 02:02:02,816
We'll find him. Trust me.

1560
02:02:13,636 --> 02:02:16,161
Do you remember the time...

1561
02:02:16,205 --> 02:02:18,469
when Marco spent the week
staring at the Mountain...

1562
02:02:18,507 --> 02:02:21,965
convinced that
The Sleeping Man would awaken?

1563
02:02:23,312 --> 02:02:25,337
And how my mother yelled at him!

1564
02:02:28,050 --> 02:02:29,608
Of course I remember.

1565
02:02:29,652 --> 02:02:31,142
Sleep. Sleep.

1566
02:02:32,855 --> 02:02:34,186
Marco's dead.

1567
02:02:35,691 --> 02:02:37,682
I killed him.

1568
02:02:37,726 --> 02:02:40,251
In a firefight with
his Fascist comrades.

1569
02:02:40,295 --> 02:02:43,162
He would've done the same to me!

1570
02:02:43,198 --> 02:02:45,098
Because we're Partisans.

1571
02:02:46,935 --> 02:02:49,403
There's nothing left to see here.

1572
02:02:53,208 --> 02:02:54,698
Peppi...

1573
02:02:56,078 --> 02:03:00,139
Listen, if someone commits a sin...

1574
02:03:00,182 --> 02:03:02,013
a big sin...

1575
02:03:06,221 --> 02:03:08,121
and then he repents...

1576
02:03:08,791 --> 02:03:10,224
and confesses.

1577
02:03:11,493 --> 02:03:13,757
do you think he'll go to Hell?

1578
02:03:15,330 --> 02:03:17,457
I don't know. I'm not a Priest.

1579
02:03:18,467 --> 02:03:20,025
What have you become?

1580
02:03:20,903 --> 02:03:22,495
I don't recognize you anymore.

1581
02:03:22,538 --> 02:03:25,473
You are here rationalizing.

1582
02:03:25,507 --> 02:03:29,307
Always talking about my dead brother.
What do you want from me?

1583
02:03:30,946 --> 02:03:33,744
Do you want to know
who betrayed you at St. Anna?

1584
02:03:33,782 --> 02:03:36,546
We should have kept the German
instead of giving him to the Americans.

1585
02:03:36,585 --> 02:03:39,053
Maybe we'd have discovered
that he can speak Italian.

1586
02:03:39,088 --> 02:03:40,988
Maybe he would have spoke of you.

1587
02:03:44,960 --> 02:03:48,293
We've known each other a lifetime,
and you think it was me?

1588
02:03:48,330 --> 02:03:50,730
This is war, Peppi.

1589
02:03:50,766 --> 02:03:53,257
And in war people suffer; people die!

1590
02:03:53,302 --> 02:03:56,738
So, do you think the people at St. Anna
had to die because this is war?

1591
02:03:57,806 --> 02:03:59,433
I didn't say that!

1592
02:03:59,475 --> 02:04:00,772
I trusted you.

1593
02:04:00,809 --> 02:04:04,768
It was you that I had
to meet to get supplies.

1594
02:04:04,813 --> 02:04:08,305
It was you who suggested
St. Anna was a safe place.

1595
02:04:08,350 --> 02:04:10,045
What did you want to do?

1596
02:04:11,320 --> 02:04:12,981
Did you want revenge
because I killed your brother?

1597
02:04:13,021 --> 02:04:14,488
For the last time...

1598
02:04:14,523 --> 02:04:15,956
You should've told me,
then I would have let them only kill me.

1599
02:04:15,991 --> 02:04:17,959
Stop talking about my dead brother.

1600
02:04:17,993 --> 02:04:20,154
You killed him!

1601
02:04:20,195 --> 02:04:23,221
Hundreds of innocent people.

1602
02:04:23,265 --> 02:04:24,857
You sent me to Hell...

1603
02:04:48,824 --> 02:04:50,189
Bastard!

1604
02:04:50,225 --> 02:04:51,385
Bastard!

1605
02:05:00,836 --> 02:05:02,269
Stamps!

1606
02:05:03,105 --> 02:05:04,697
Stamps!

1607
02:05:06,074 --> 02:05:08,736
- We got problems.
- Where you been?

1608
02:05:08,777 --> 02:05:09,869
Where's the Jerry?

1609
02:05:09,912 --> 02:05:11,573
That son of a bitch
Rodolfo slit his throat.

1610
02:05:11,613 --> 02:05:13,444
Then he killed Peppi.

1611
02:05:13,482 --> 02:05:16,042
- What happened to your neck?
- He tried to kill me.

1612
02:05:16,084 --> 02:05:18,882
- He was no good.
- Roll before the heavy mail comes.

1613
02:05:18,921 --> 02:05:21,389
Go get a bandage. Go get your radio.

1614
02:05:24,860 --> 02:05:27,226
Bishop! Where's your weapon?

1615
02:05:29,198 --> 02:05:30,631
I'm here.

1616
02:05:32,167 --> 02:05:34,465
- Where's Siegfried?
- The Italian killed him.

1617
02:05:34,503 --> 02:05:35,697
No shit?

1618
02:05:38,006 --> 02:05:39,633
Nokes still comin', ain't he?

1619
02:05:39,675 --> 02:05:42,803
Get your gear, get to
Old Man Loody's house on the double.

1620
02:05:42,845 --> 02:05:45,473
Hadn't sent that doofus over,
we wouldn't be here.

1621
02:05:45,514 --> 02:05:48,074
I ain't send that dense
nigga no place. Bullshit.

1622
02:05:48,116 --> 02:05:51,745
What you done is worse.
Beat the man out of the 1,400 chips.

1623
02:06:42,204 --> 02:06:45,571
That tight pussy was on its own
so long it needed to be adopted.

1624
02:06:45,607 --> 02:06:46,904
Talk!

1625
02:06:58,387 --> 02:06:59,752
I'll kill you!

1626
02:07:08,363 --> 02:07:12,265
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!
I'll make you swallow that gold tooth!

1627
02:07:12,301 --> 02:07:14,098
- Hey! Get off him!
- What?

1628
02:07:14,136 --> 02:07:17,799
I said get off! Nokes is here!

1629
02:07:17,839 --> 02:07:20,899
- Nokes is here!
- Get off me!

1630
02:07:20,943 --> 02:07:23,036
Kill yourselves on your own time.

1631
02:07:49,771 --> 02:07:52,865
Hey, boys. Which one of you's Stamps?

1632
02:07:52,908 --> 02:07:55,741
- Sir.
- Did ya get that goddamn Kraut fucker?

1633
02:07:55,777 --> 02:07:58,337
- Captain...
- I don't wanna hear shit other than

1634
02:07:58,380 --> 02:08:02,783
how the fuck you ended up miles on
the wrong side of this goddamn valley.

1635
02:08:02,818 --> 02:08:04,843
Kraut's around the corner there.

1636
02:08:06,421 --> 02:08:08,616
Birdsong, find out what his problem is

1637
02:08:08,657 --> 02:08:10,784
while I go get the goose-stepper.

1638
02:08:10,826 --> 02:08:13,989
Stamps, you got two minutes
to get your balls out of a sling.

1639
02:08:16,365 --> 02:08:20,324
- Get rid of that kid.
- I've been trying to, sir.

1640
02:08:20,369 --> 02:08:24,032
But I guess he don't wanna let me go.
He's a nice little fella.

1641
02:08:24,072 --> 02:08:27,667
- Ain't he cute?
- I said get rid of him.

1642
02:08:27,709 --> 02:08:32,737
I don't know what to do with him, sir.
I ain't gonna leave him.

1643
02:08:32,781 --> 02:08:35,249
So I figure to take him along.

1644
02:08:35,283 --> 02:08:39,982
He don't talk much, but he do tap.
See here? Watch this here.

1645
02:08:40,022 --> 02:08:43,423
- I do this, and then...
- What the fuck is wrong with you?

1646
02:08:43,458 --> 02:08:46,359
Spent two days risking
our asses gettin' here for you.

1647
02:08:46,395 --> 02:08:49,922
It's good men, white men in this man's
army holding back that attack,

1648
02:08:49,965 --> 02:08:52,798
and you gonna talk to me
about some damn dago wop kid?

1649
02:08:55,504 --> 02:08:58,996
- I feel sorry for him, sir.
- You feel sorry for him?

1650
02:09:00,475 --> 02:09:02,966
OK.

1651
02:09:05,981 --> 02:09:10,645
OK, button up, get in the Jeep,
and let's get the fuck out of here.

1652
02:09:12,454 --> 02:09:15,912
Ain't no cause for that kind of talk
in front of no child, sir.

1653
02:09:15,957 --> 02:09:18,892
You ain't got to make him cry now, sir.

1654
02:09:18,927 --> 02:09:20,792
- No.
- Cool it, Diesel.

1655
02:09:20,829 --> 02:09:23,320
Nobody gonna talk to my boy like that.

1656
02:09:23,365 --> 02:09:27,461
Cussin' and thumpin' and yellin'
and carryin' on. Spittin'.

1657
02:09:27,502 --> 02:09:31,165
- Easy, big fella.
- He's a child, sir.

1658
02:09:31,206 --> 02:09:35,870
Sir. Sir. Train got a mind of his own.

1659
02:09:35,911 --> 02:09:40,211
It was my idea to bring the kid.
We got him down at the Serchio River.

1660
02:09:40,248 --> 02:09:44,446
The fact is the kid won't leave us.
I told Train to take him.

1661
02:09:44,486 --> 02:09:46,420
Mm-hm.

1662
02:09:47,756 --> 02:09:49,485
You handle your men.

1663
02:09:50,992 --> 02:09:52,619
Move.

1664
02:09:52,661 --> 02:09:55,858
- Captain Nokes got a filthy mouth.
- Come here.

1665
02:09:56,998 --> 02:09:59,398
- Renata.
- Come here! Train.

1666
02:09:59,434 --> 02:10:02,335
Give the kid to Loosey-Goosey.
She'll do a fine job.

1667
02:10:02,370 --> 02:10:05,396
- She ain't his mama.
- I know, but you gotta give him up.

1668
02:10:05,440 --> 02:10:09,604
She don't know him good as I do. I got a
granny back home who'll raise him right.

1669
02:10:09,644 --> 02:10:13,273
- Train, give him to me. Please.
- Sarge.

1670
02:10:14,382 --> 02:10:15,849
Come here. Come to me.

1671
02:10:15,884 --> 02:10:18,045
- He don't wanna go.
- Come to me, please.

1672
02:10:18,086 --> 02:10:20,884
This some kind of fuckin' minstrel show?

1673
02:10:28,263 --> 02:10:30,527
Move! Get out of my goddamn way!

1674
02:10:30,565 --> 02:10:34,433
Get out of my goddamn way! Move!

1675
02:10:38,440 --> 02:10:41,773
This Kraut fucker's dead!
From the crew cut down.

1676
02:10:41,810 --> 02:10:43,539
How did he get that way?

1677
02:10:45,780 --> 02:10:47,805
I guess somebody killed him, sir.

1678
02:10:47,849 --> 02:10:51,683
I can see that, Staff Sergeant Stamps.
But how did he get killed?

1679
02:10:51,720 --> 02:10:53,984
- Didn't you put a man on him?
- I did.

1680
02:10:54,022 --> 02:10:56,456
- The Partisan killed him.
- Dropped the ball!

1681
02:10:56,491 --> 02:11:01,087
You dropped the fuckin' ball!
You fucked up big time.

1682
02:11:01,129 --> 02:11:03,962
Now, all four of you
gonna be court-martialed.

1683
02:11:03,999 --> 02:11:07,230
One, two, three and four.

1684
02:11:07,269 --> 02:11:10,136
Sir, we gotta pull out now.

1685
02:11:11,072 --> 02:11:13,199
Now, you load up, soldier.

1686
02:11:15,410 --> 02:11:18,743
About this child? If I could
just get a word with you about...

1687
02:11:18,780 --> 02:11:23,615
For the last time, soldier. I told you
to get in that goddamn Jeep.

1688
02:11:23,652 --> 02:11:26,052
Ain't no need to shoot
the man over no child.

1689
02:11:26,087 --> 02:11:28,385
We can take him to headquarters.
We got room.

1690
02:11:28,423 --> 02:11:30,983
Yeah. Ain't no trouble.
We can take the kid.

1691
02:11:31,026 --> 02:11:34,928
Lieutenant Birdsong,
you take that goddamn kid.

1692
02:11:34,963 --> 02:11:38,228
- Huh?
- You heard me.

1693
02:11:40,268 --> 02:11:42,532
Don't make it tough on me,
big fella.

1694
02:11:42,571 --> 02:11:45,506
You better not
come no closer.

1695
02:11:47,542 --> 02:11:48,941
Wouldn't do that, sir.

1696
02:11:50,812 --> 02:11:53,007
- Choke him, Train!
- Train, for God's sake!

1697
02:11:54,616 --> 02:11:57,244
- Choke that tar.
- Put him down.

1698
02:11:57,285 --> 02:11:58,809
Soldier, put him down!

1699
02:11:58,853 --> 02:12:00,878
He's had enough.
Put him down.

1700
02:12:00,922 --> 02:12:02,913
Choke the shit
out of that fucker!

1701
02:12:02,958 --> 02:12:05,017
Put him down right this second!

1702
02:12:05,060 --> 02:12:07,426
Chocolate Giant!

1703
02:12:07,462 --> 02:12:09,020
The Sleeping Man.

1704
02:12:09,064 --> 02:12:12,625
- Diesel, you're killing 'im.
- Put him down!

1705
02:12:12,667 --> 02:12:14,066
Leave him be, Stamps.

1706
02:12:14,102 --> 02:12:15,467
That's right, big fella.

1707
02:12:15,503 --> 02:12:18,961
- Birdsong! Son, you OK?
- Crazy black bastard!

1708
02:12:19,007 --> 02:12:20,804
- Come here.
- Help me get him.

1709
02:12:20,842 --> 02:12:22,434
Get back. Get back.

1710
02:12:22,477 --> 02:12:24,001
Let me take him.

1711
02:12:25,213 --> 02:12:28,410
- I'll see you again, Stamps.
- I hope so.

1712
02:12:31,720 --> 02:12:33,711
- Come on!
- Let's move out! Let's go!

1713
02:12:36,691 --> 02:12:38,124
Come on. Let's move out.

1714
02:12:49,504 --> 02:12:51,096
It's the Germans!

1715
02:13:05,887 --> 02:13:07,855
Natalina!

1716
02:13:07,889 --> 02:13:10,119
Go! Go! Go!

1717
02:13:10,158 --> 02:13:11,785
Natalina!

1718
02:13:14,496 --> 02:13:16,396
Come away. Come with me.

1719
02:13:27,342 --> 02:13:30,368
Hector! Go get Ludovico! Go!

1720
02:13:33,415 --> 02:13:34,848
Wait!

1721
02:13:38,787 --> 02:13:40,914
Bishop! Cover me!

1722
02:13:40,955 --> 02:13:41,979
Go, go, go!

1723
02:13:48,463 --> 02:13:49,930
Ludovico!

1724
02:13:51,032 --> 02:13:52,795
Natalina!

1725
02:14:01,409 --> 02:14:04,242
<i>Papa! Papa!</i>

1726
02:14:17,659 --> 02:14:20,059
Bishop! Bishop!

1727
02:14:21,396 --> 02:14:22,556
Bishop!

1728
02:14:25,200 --> 02:14:27,794
Bishop! Bishop!

1729
02:14:29,104 --> 02:14:30,196
Train!

1730
02:14:50,925 --> 02:14:52,722
Forward! Forward!

1731
02:14:52,761 --> 02:14:54,194
Spread out!

1732
02:14:54,229 --> 02:14:56,060
Move! Spread out!

1733
02:14:56,097 --> 02:14:58,429
Forward. Be alert.

1734
02:15:10,879 --> 02:15:13,575
Jesus Lord, Bishop,
I can't move my head.

1735
02:15:13,615 --> 02:15:15,742
- Is my boy livin'?
- Yeah.

1736
02:15:15,784 --> 02:15:17,115
Is he livin'?

1737
02:15:17,152 --> 02:15:19,746
He just got a little scratch,
but he gonna be OK.

1738
02:15:19,788 --> 02:15:22,222
That's good. That's good.

1739
02:15:24,959 --> 02:15:27,484
Tell Hector to put that
little old cross on him.

1740
02:15:27,529 --> 02:15:30,896
- Let him know who his daddy is.
- OK.

1741
02:15:30,932 --> 02:15:34,629
Here. Take this.

1742
02:15:42,744 --> 02:15:46,840
Uh-huh. You seen it the whole time,
didn't you, Bishop?

1743
02:15:48,183 --> 02:15:51,846
I knew it. I knew it...

1744
02:15:55,924 --> 02:15:59,724
Train, I'm gonna take this kid,
and I'm gonna come back for you.

1745
02:15:59,761 --> 02:16:01,490
I'm gonna come right back for you.

1746
02:16:01,529 --> 02:16:03,394
All right. I'll be right here.

1747
02:16:07,635 --> 02:16:09,762
Liberty!

1748
02:16:21,783 --> 02:16:23,978
I'm gonna come
right back for you.

1749
02:16:28,790 --> 02:16:30,018
Damn!

1750
02:16:43,404 --> 02:16:44,598
Forward!

1751
02:16:55,550 --> 02:16:56,574
Train.

1752
02:17:09,864 --> 02:17:11,559
Bishop!

1753
02:17:12,901 --> 02:17:16,359
Bishop! Bishop!

1754
02:17:36,658 --> 02:17:38,023
Move, move, move.

1755
02:17:38,626 --> 02:17:41,026
Lock down the village. Move!

1756
02:17:42,797 --> 02:17:44,059
Clear the buildings!

1757
02:17:46,067 --> 02:17:47,728
Come on, kill the Blacks!

1758
02:17:47,769 --> 02:17:49,396
Those pigs. This way.

1759
02:17:49,437 --> 02:17:50,461
Over there.

1760
02:17:56,945 --> 02:17:58,344
Go! Go! Go! Go!

1761
02:18:08,356 --> 02:18:11,018
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

1762
02:18:15,663 --> 02:18:17,096
Move. Move.

1763
02:18:47,228 --> 02:18:50,322
- Go! Go! Go!
- Run! Run!

1764
02:18:51,466 --> 02:18:52,592
Stamps!

1765
02:18:52,634 --> 02:18:53,931
Stamps!

1766
02:18:53,968 --> 02:18:55,333
Stamps!

1767
02:19:01,142 --> 02:19:02,609
Get down!

1768
02:19:02,644 --> 02:19:04,202
We are Fascists!

1769
02:19:04,245 --> 02:19:06,076
Fascists!

1770
02:19:40,081 --> 02:19:41,571
Stamps!

1771
02:20:11,045 --> 02:20:12,205
Angelo.

1772
02:20:12,246 --> 02:20:14,214
Angelo.

1773
02:20:14,248 --> 02:20:15,772
You're not dead anymore.

1774
02:20:15,817 --> 02:20:18,217
Open your eyes.

1775
02:20:18,252 --> 02:20:19,583
Angelo.

1776
02:20:23,558 --> 02:20:25,992
Arturo, where am I?

1777
02:20:26,027 --> 02:20:27,324
It's not important.

1778
02:20:27,361 --> 02:20:29,352
We have to go.

1779
02:20:29,397 --> 02:20:31,024
Am I going to Heaven?

1780
02:20:31,065 --> 02:20:32,794
No, you're going home.

1781
02:20:32,834 --> 02:20:33,926
Where's my home?

1782
02:20:33,968 --> 02:20:35,833
Angelo, I'll show you.

1783
02:20:35,870 --> 02:20:37,201
Who's there?

1784
02:20:37,238 --> 02:20:39,638
Your Papa. Remember him?

1785
02:20:41,008 --> 02:20:42,373
What about my friend...

1786
02:20:42,410 --> 02:20:44,241
the Chocolate Giant?

1787
02:21:00,595 --> 02:21:02,119
You have to remember him,

1788
02:21:02,964 --> 02:21:04,454
me,

1789
02:21:04,499 --> 02:21:06,433
all of this.

1790
02:21:06,467 --> 02:21:08,935
This was our time to be children.

1791
02:21:35,730 --> 02:21:36,754
Come here.

1792
02:22:15,436 --> 02:22:16,903
Prepare to die.

1793
02:22:18,372 --> 02:22:19,862
This is over.

1794
02:22:19,907 --> 02:22:21,636
Gather the wounded...

1795
02:22:21,676 --> 02:22:23,075
and bury our dead.

1796
02:22:23,110 --> 02:22:24,907
Let's go.

1797
02:22:24,946 --> 02:22:26,573
Let's go.

1798
02:22:26,614 --> 02:22:27,672
Let's go.

1799
02:22:41,829 --> 02:22:43,387
Defend yourself.

1800
02:23:12,927 --> 02:23:16,328
- Medic! We need you right now!
- Right here.

1801
02:23:16,364 --> 02:23:17,854
Guys, we need a hand.

1802
02:23:22,870 --> 02:23:25,304
Stand by. Lift!

1803
02:23:37,551 --> 02:23:40,384
Easy, y'all. Real easy.

1804
02:23:40,421 --> 02:23:44,585
It's gonna be OK, Hector. You're going
back home to New York, man.

1805
02:23:53,000 --> 02:23:55,264
Reconnaissance photos
were accurate.

1806
02:23:55,303 --> 02:23:58,363
General Almond wouldn't listen.
Go get those dog tags.

1807
02:23:58,406 --> 02:23:59,703
Yes, sir.

1808
02:23:59,740 --> 02:24:01,935
I need a full report,
on the double.

1809
02:24:03,477 --> 02:24:06,037
- "Stamps, Aubrey."
- Got it.

1810
02:24:08,049 --> 02:24:10,745
- "Cummings, Bishop."
- Check.

1811
02:24:13,821 --> 02:24:16,289
- "Train, Samuel."
- Got it.

1812
02:24:23,698 --> 02:24:26,792
Well done, corporal.
You earned yourself a Purple Heart.

1813
02:24:26,834 --> 02:24:29,268
- Get this man to the aid station.
- Yes, sir!

1814
02:24:29,303 --> 02:24:30,827
Detail.

1815
02:24:38,612 --> 02:24:41,547
Come on, Mr. Negron.
You're clean as a board of health.

1816
02:24:41,582 --> 02:24:47,111
You got no kids, no debts. No enemies.
Four years in the service. Purple Heart.

1817
02:24:47,154 --> 02:24:52,285
Why stick a German Luger in a guy's
chest three months short of retirement?

1818
02:24:53,494 --> 02:24:55,826
You're looking at 25 to life, pal.

1819
02:25:08,542 --> 02:25:11,170
<i>State v. Hector Negron.</i>

1820
02:25:11,212 --> 02:25:16,616
Case 14, dockets 79A and 34B.

1821
02:25:16,650 --> 02:25:20,780
Judge Trinkoff presiding. All rise.

1822
02:25:22,757 --> 02:25:27,490
Peter Hammond, District Attorney,
representing People, State of New York.

1823
02:25:27,528 --> 02:25:30,520
Michael Decker, legal aid for defense.

1824
02:25:31,465 --> 02:25:33,490
It's Zana Wilder.

1825
02:25:33,534 --> 02:25:35,832
Michael, let me handle this.

1826
02:25:35,870 --> 02:25:40,239
Legal aid will be withdrawing. Miss
Wilder will be counsel for defense.

1827
02:25:40,274 --> 02:25:41,866
Say nothing, do nothing.

1828
02:25:41,909 --> 02:25:44,469
Your Honor, we ask
that bail be set at two million.

1829
02:25:44,512 --> 02:25:46,946
Defendant murdered a man in cold blood.

1830
02:25:46,981 --> 02:25:50,883
Also, he was in possession of a famous
missing artifact stolen from Italy.

1831
02:25:50,918 --> 02:25:54,479
The old stolen statue head case.
Whatever happened with that?

1832
02:25:54,522 --> 02:25:56,683
The victim is dead, Your Honor.

1833
02:25:56,724 --> 02:26:01,718
Rudolph Tringali, from St. Anna di...
something or other, in Italy.

1834
02:26:01,762 --> 02:26:04,856
Immigrant textile worker,
lived in the Bronx.

1835
02:26:04,899 --> 02:26:07,094
Not him. The statue head.

1836
02:26:07,134 --> 02:26:10,797
Oh, that was returned
to Florence, Italy, Your Honor.

1837
02:26:10,838 --> 02:26:14,968
Proposed bail at two million.
Defense?

1838
02:26:15,009 --> 02:26:16,738
Defendant will post cash bail.

1839
02:26:20,247 --> 02:26:25,116
- Miss Wilder, approach the bench.
- Yes, Your Honor.

1840
02:26:28,756 --> 02:26:33,193
What are you doing here?
Exxon buying the U.S. Postal Service?

1841
02:26:33,227 --> 02:26:37,357
It's a Christmas pro bono case.
Picked it out of a hat.

1842
02:26:37,398 --> 02:26:40,196
My ass. I smell a rat.

1843
02:26:41,402 --> 02:26:43,029
If you expect to get appointed

1844
02:26:43,070 --> 02:26:45,334
to the appellate court next year,

1845
02:26:45,372 --> 02:26:47,932
I suggest you cover your nose.

1846
02:26:54,115 --> 02:26:57,812
Bail set at two million. Next case.

1847
02:27:01,922 --> 02:27:05,585
- Can I ask you a question, miss?
- Anything you wish, Mr. Negron.

1848
02:27:05,626 --> 02:27:08,595
- Who are you?
- A friend of a friend.

1849
02:27:08,629 --> 02:27:12,030
- Jennifer, let's go.
- Right behind you.

1850
02:27:13,134 --> 02:27:14,795
- Thank you.
- Mm-hm.

1851
02:27:17,204 --> 02:27:20,901
Mr. Negron. Mr. Negron,
who's the Sleeping Man?

1852
02:27:24,345 --> 02:27:26,575
Who is he? Mr. Negron?

1853
02:27:28,916 --> 02:27:30,907
Who's the Sleeping Man?

1854
02:28:04,785 --> 02:28:09,119
- Where are we?
- Rose Island, Nassau, Bahamas.

1855
02:28:09,156 --> 02:28:12,853
- You have a friend who wants to meet.
- No.

1856
02:28:12,893 --> 02:28:16,989
- All my true friends are dead.
- Not this one.

1857
02:28:17,031 --> 02:28:19,693
Your friend has learned
there is no control in life.

1858
02:28:19,733 --> 02:28:22,463
Wherever you go, wherever
you hide, there's risk.

1859
02:28:22,503 --> 02:28:25,597
Your friend understood,
turned knowledge into invention:

1860
02:28:25,639 --> 02:28:31,236
Seat belts, safety devices and so forth.
And your friend made a fortune.

1861
02:28:31,278 --> 02:28:34,770
People pay for control,
even if they have none.

1862
02:28:34,815 --> 02:28:37,010
Safety is the greatest risk of all,

1863
02:28:37,051 --> 02:28:39,747
'cause safety leaves
no room for miracles.

1864
02:28:39,787 --> 02:28:43,052
And miracles are the only
sure thing in life.

1865
02:28:43,090 --> 02:28:47,220
Mister, you talk crazy.
Now, I don't want a miracle.

1866
02:28:47,261 --> 02:28:50,992
I just wanna join my wife,
Lourdes, in the glory of heaven.

1867
02:28:51,031 --> 02:28:52,999
Is that too much to ask for?

1868
02:29:47,388 --> 02:29:49,515
I was the only one left.

1869
02:29:51,358 --> 02:29:54,020
I'm the only one left who knows.

1870
02:29:54,061 --> 02:29:57,258
- I'm the last.
- You're not the last.

1871
02:30:17,451 --> 02:30:19,385
There was a little boy.

1872
02:30:20,954 --> 02:30:23,320
- It is I.
- Angelo?

1873
02:30:23,357 --> 02:30:24,790
Angelo!

1874
02:30:33,100 --> 02:30:34,692
Angelo.

1875
02:30:38,706 --> 02:30:40,537
Angelo.

1876
02:30:45,512 --> 02:30:47,571
Angelo.

1877
