1
00:02:10,854 --> 00:02:13,652
This is a diary of...

2
00:02:15,694 --> 00:02:16,968
hate.

3
00:02:21,854 --> 00:02:24,573
And perhaps I wouldn't
be writing it...

4
00:02:24,774 --> 00:02:29,404
if some devil hadn't made me stop
him that night in the rain.

5
00:02:31,134 --> 00:02:33,170
You want to drown, Henry?

6
00:02:36,334 --> 00:02:38,165
I wanted a bit of air.

7
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:41,252
How nice to see you, Bendrix.

8
00:02:41,854 --> 00:02:43,970
How long has it been? A year?

9
00:02:44,814 --> 00:02:46,691
June 1944.

10
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:48,972
As long as that?

11
00:02:49,454 --> 00:02:51,046
How's Sarah?

12
00:02:51,814 --> 00:02:54,044
She's out and about somewhere.

13
00:02:54,734 --> 00:02:56,372
She at the cinema?

14
00:02:57,134 --> 00:02:59,170
No, she never goes.

15
00:03:01,854 --> 00:03:02,684
Good night, Henry.

16
00:03:03,854 --> 00:03:06,414
You should go home before
you catch your death.

17
00:03:09,774 --> 00:03:11,571
Is something wrong?

18
00:03:15,854 --> 00:03:17,526
Let me take you home, Henry.

19
00:03:20,454 --> 00:03:22,763
Or perhaps I wouldn't
be writing this...

20
00:03:23,014 --> 00:03:25,767
if I had known then who I hated.

21
00:03:25,974 --> 00:03:28,886
Was it Henry?
Was it his wife, Sarah?

22
00:03:30,254 --> 00:03:34,770
Or was it some other, who was
yet to be revealed to me?

23
00:03:36,894 --> 00:03:38,373
Sarah?

24
00:03:44,254 --> 00:03:46,563
See, she's out still.

25
00:03:54,054 --> 00:03:55,772
Come upstairs.

26
00:04:18,214 --> 00:04:20,284
Come in. Let me get you a drink.

27
00:04:20,534 --> 00:04:22,365
Whiskey, thank you.

28
00:04:33,334 --> 00:04:35,564
So what's troubling you, Henry?

29
00:04:37,334 --> 00:04:38,562
Sarah.

30
00:04:50,254 --> 00:04:53,769
She's out for a walk now, Bendrix.

31
00:04:57,174 --> 00:04:58,766
A walk.

32
00:04:59,054 --> 00:05:02,171
Well, she always was a great walker.

33
00:05:16,054 --> 00:05:18,045
Jealousy's a terrible thing.

34
00:05:19,534 --> 00:05:21,570
Well, you know you can
trust me, Henry.

35
00:05:24,254 --> 00:05:27,212
You know, I went so far...

36
00:05:27,454 --> 00:05:30,173
as to get the name
of a private detective.

37
00:05:31,934 --> 00:05:35,370
Do you think she's seeing someone?

38
00:05:35,734 --> 00:05:37,611
- Of course. You think me a fool?
- No.

39
00:05:39,014 --> 00:05:40,766
I don't think you're a fool.

40
00:05:42,254 --> 00:05:44,449
- You mean you think it's possible?
- Of course.

41
00:05:44,814 --> 00:05:46,566
Sarah's human.

42
00:05:49,654 --> 00:05:51,372
I can't sleep.

43
00:05:53,774 --> 00:05:58,609
I keep picking up this wretched card.

44
00:06:01,814 --> 00:06:02,610
Burn it.

45
00:06:02,854 --> 00:06:05,846
- I wish I could.
- Then go see... Who? Savage?

46
00:06:06,254 --> 00:06:08,973
And sit where all the other
jealous husbands sit?

47
00:06:10,654 --> 00:06:12,565
Do you think they have
a waiting room...

48
00:06:12,774 --> 00:06:15,334
where we see each other's
faces as we pass?

49
00:06:15,574 --> 00:06:17,212
Why not let me go, Henry?

50
00:06:18,974 --> 00:06:20,327
- You?
- Yes.

51
00:06:20,614 --> 00:06:23,412
I could pretend to be a jealous lover.

52
00:06:23,654 --> 00:06:26,851
Jealous lovers are less ridiculous
than jealous husbands.

53
00:06:27,054 --> 00:06:29,249
They're supported by
the weight of literature.

54
00:06:29,614 --> 00:06:32,811
Tragic, never comic.
Think of Trollus.

55
00:06:33,054 --> 00:06:36,729
I shan't lose my amour-propre
when I interview Mr. Savage.

56
00:06:38,334 --> 00:06:40,768
It's ridiculous. One's friend
can't spy on one's wife...

57
00:06:40,974 --> 00:06:44,125
...and pretend to be her lover.
- What else are friends for?

58
00:06:44,334 --> 00:06:48,407
You're a good chap, Bendrix. All I
needed was to talk, clear my head.

59
00:06:48,614 --> 00:06:51,367
The name was Savage,
and the address was 3 Vigo Passage.

60
00:06:51,614 --> 00:06:54,970
Forget what I said. Doesn't
make sense. I'll see a doctor.

61
00:06:57,134 --> 00:06:58,692
That was the door.
Sarah's home.

62
00:06:59,934 --> 00:07:02,084
It's the maid.
She's been to the pictures.

63
00:07:02,814 --> 00:07:05,169
No, it was Sarah's step.

64
00:07:08,254 --> 00:07:09,733
Sarah, darling.

65
00:07:14,174 --> 00:07:15,289
You. Is that you?

66
00:07:15,534 --> 00:07:16,603
Been out for a walk?

67
00:07:16,814 --> 00:07:18,725
- Yes.
- It's a filthy night.

68
00:07:18,934 --> 00:07:22,324
You're wet through, Sarah.
You'll catch your death of cold.

69
00:07:23,934 --> 00:07:25,208
Good night.

70
00:07:30,454 --> 00:07:34,606
Their marriage was conventional,
like their well-appointed house.

71
00:07:34,854 --> 00:07:37,846
And I liked them both
the first night we met...

72
00:07:38,054 --> 00:07:41,808
drinking bad South African sherry
because of the war in Spain.

73
00:07:43,174 --> 00:07:44,812
Good evening.
May I take your hat?

74
00:07:45,054 --> 00:07:46,009
Thank you.

75
00:07:46,254 --> 00:07:48,210
Mr. Mlles is upstairs.

76
00:07:55,454 --> 00:07:56,409
Sherry, sir?

77
00:07:56,654 --> 00:07:57,769
Thank you.

78
00:07:58,254 --> 00:08:00,768
She seemed restless.

79
00:08:01,614 --> 00:08:05,846
In the summer of 1939, the whole
of London was restless...

80
00:08:06,054 --> 00:08:07,806
in the face of the coming storm.

81
00:08:24,414 --> 00:08:27,372
Sarah, this is our neighbour,
the novelist chap.

82
00:08:27,614 --> 00:08:29,252
What's a novelist doing here?

83
00:08:29,454 --> 00:08:30,409
- Research.
- On what?

84
00:08:30,614 --> 00:08:31,763
On your husband.

85
00:08:31,974 --> 00:08:35,011
I'm writing a character who
works for the ministry.

86
00:08:35,254 --> 00:08:38,166
I need to know his habits.
What he drinks at bedtime...

87
00:08:38,414 --> 00:08:39,688
- Cocoa.
- And when.

88
00:08:39,934 --> 00:08:40,969
Eleven o'clock.

89
00:08:41,214 --> 00:08:43,091
Unless we're entertaining.

90
00:08:43,334 --> 00:08:45,689
Would you excuse your character?

91
00:08:45,934 --> 00:08:48,767
- The ministry needs him.
- Unfortunately, it does.

92
00:08:50,374 --> 00:08:51,409
- So tell me.
- What?

93
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:52,524
His secrets.

94
00:08:52,734 --> 00:08:54,804
Henry's a good man.
He has no secrets.

95
00:08:55,054 --> 00:08:59,172
I was afraid you'd say that. Goodness
has so little fictional value.

96
00:08:59,374 --> 00:09:00,853
What does have fictional value?

97
00:09:01,454 --> 00:09:04,093
- A minister of home security.
- My husband's fictional?

98
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:07,047
I'm saying he could be.
In the right hands.

99
00:09:07,294 --> 00:09:09,728
Can we head away from
the service for a moment?

100
00:09:09,934 --> 00:09:11,003
Change the subject?

101
00:09:11,254 --> 00:09:14,166
- I meant fresh air actually.
- Of course.

102
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:18,847
- How long have you been married?
- Is your character married?

103
00:09:19,054 --> 00:09:21,568
Yes, he's been married
apply for 10 years.

104
00:09:21,774 --> 00:09:24,368
Henry's a perfect model then.
We've been married 10 years.

105
00:09:24,574 --> 00:09:28,362
You know that happiness is even harder
to write than goodness.

106
00:09:28,574 --> 00:09:31,168
Henry prefers habit to happiness.

107
00:09:35,214 --> 00:09:37,569
We were discussing the house, darling.

108
00:09:39,374 --> 00:09:41,171
Let me fill that for you.

109
00:09:41,854 --> 00:09:44,049
- It's a lovely house.
- My wife found it.

110
00:09:44,294 --> 00:09:45,852
Your wife is charming.

111
00:09:46,054 --> 00:09:48,204
- She's a great help to me.
- Yes, I'm sure.

112
00:09:48,414 --> 00:09:50,803
Haven't they made a picture
of one of your books?

113
00:09:51,014 --> 00:09:54,848
Yes, it's playing at the Rialto.
I'll take you both.

114
00:09:55,054 --> 00:09:57,090
I'm far too busy for pictures,
I'm afraid.

115
00:09:57,334 --> 00:09:58,210
Should I note that?

116
00:09:58,414 --> 00:10:00,723
Make sure your character's
never home before 10.

117
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:03,528
- Come out, Henry. For once?
- I can't, darling.

118
00:10:04,334 --> 00:10:08,407
But you go. Take her, Bendrix.
With Sarah, one has to insist.

119
00:10:19,254 --> 00:10:22,610
- It's not what I wrote, you know.
- You can't keep saying that.

120
00:10:22,854 --> 00:10:24,082
It's true.

121
00:10:24,334 --> 00:10:25,562
I know.

122
00:10:35,534 --> 00:10:37,604
There was one scene you did write.

123
00:10:37,854 --> 00:10:39,003
Describe it.

124
00:10:39,254 --> 00:10:41,529
Where he offered her onions
with her meal.

125
00:10:41,734 --> 00:10:46,364
She refused because her husband didn't
like the smell. And he got angry.

126
00:10:47,934 --> 00:10:49,765
And why did he get angry?

127
00:10:52,654 --> 00:10:55,373
He didn't want to think of her
going home to him.

128
00:11:02,774 --> 00:11:04,253
Does Henry like onions?

129
00:11:05,254 --> 00:11:06,573
No.

130
00:11:30,574 --> 00:11:32,371
I'm in love, you know.

131
00:11:34,534 --> 00:11:35,967
Me too.

132
00:11:42,814 --> 00:11:44,167
Susan?

133
00:12:43,334 --> 00:12:44,972
Come upstairs.

134
00:14:27,174 --> 00:14:28,573
Sarah?

135
00:14:35,934 --> 00:14:37,765
One minute, dear.

136
00:14:40,174 --> 00:14:41,493
What if he heard?

137
00:14:42,654 --> 00:14:44,884
He wouldn't recognize the sound.

138
00:14:59,334 --> 00:15:01,529
- Sarah, been eating onions?
- Sorry, darling.

139
00:15:03,214 --> 00:15:04,693
Bendrix, how was the picture?

140
00:15:05,214 --> 00:15:06,966
Up to scratch?

141
00:15:09,454 --> 00:15:12,332
And, of course,
as she began to love me...

142
00:15:12,574 --> 00:15:15,134
she learnt to deceive Henry.

143
00:15:15,334 --> 00:15:19,247
So why was I upset to find
that two years later...

144
00:15:19,454 --> 00:15:22,014
she was deceiving him again?

145
00:15:32,214 --> 00:15:35,843
Mr. Bendrix, I assume we're
discussing Mrs. Bendrix.

146
00:15:36,054 --> 00:15:39,490
Not exactly.
She's the wife of a friend of mine.

147
00:15:39,694 --> 00:15:42,367
Perhaps you and the lady are intimate?

148
00:15:43,974 --> 00:15:46,886
I've only seen her once since 1944.

149
00:15:47,134 --> 00:15:51,207
I don't understand.
You said this was a watching case.

150
00:15:55,014 --> 00:15:57,972
Can't one love or hate
as long as that?

151
00:15:58,854 --> 00:16:01,687
There's nothing discreditable
about jealousy.

152
00:16:02,734 --> 00:16:05,043
I always salute it as a mark
of true love.

153
00:16:05,254 --> 00:16:08,803
I've come on behalf of the husband.
He thinks she's deceiving him.

154
00:16:09,414 --> 00:16:11,291
She has secrets.

155
00:16:11,494 --> 00:16:12,404
Secrets.

156
00:16:13,574 --> 00:16:15,485
There may be
nothing in it, of course.

157
00:16:15,934 --> 00:16:20,371
In my experience, Mr. Bendrix,
there almost invariably is.

158
00:16:22,254 --> 00:16:24,085
Shall we report to you
or the husband?

159
00:16:24,334 --> 00:16:26,973
To me. He must know nothing about it.

160
00:16:29,854 --> 00:16:31,333
A most interesting case.

161
00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:36,283
All my men use great discretion.
I will put one on it immediately...

162
00:16:36,494 --> 00:16:39,611
and he will do his damnedest
to put your mind at rest.

163
00:16:42,454 --> 00:16:44,046
Or should I say, the husband's?

164
00:17:07,574 --> 00:17:08,404
Good.

165
00:17:08,654 --> 00:17:11,407
Yes, it was good to see you.

166
00:17:11,654 --> 00:17:15,613
Yes, how long has it been?
Two years. As long as that?

167
00:17:15,854 --> 00:17:18,573
You were always better
at anniversaries than me.

168
00:17:19,654 --> 00:17:22,771
You want to meet?
Well, whatever for?

169
00:17:24,774 --> 00:17:27,766
Not tomorrow, no.
I've got this article.

170
00:17:28,574 --> 00:17:31,168
Wednesday? Let me check.

171
00:17:35,974 --> 00:17:37,965
Would Thursday do?

172
00:17:38,854 --> 00:17:41,766
Good. The Park Lane Hotel at 1?

173
00:17:56,254 --> 00:17:59,132
It was odd to think
that during the war...

174
00:17:59,374 --> 00:18:02,127
we could be so totally at peace.

175
00:18:02,934 --> 00:18:06,768
There were nights when I wished
those sirens would never end.

176
00:18:34,254 --> 00:18:35,767
Tell me again.

177
00:18:36,574 --> 00:18:37,973
I love you.

178
00:18:41,374 --> 00:18:43,171
And I always will.

179
00:18:59,774 --> 00:19:03,050
I'm sorry I'm late.
I came by tube, but it was crowded.

180
00:19:03,294 --> 00:19:04,773
Well, taxi's quicker.

181
00:19:04,974 --> 00:19:07,363
I know. Didn't want to be quick.

182
00:19:09,854 --> 00:19:11,526
I booked a table at Palmer's.

183
00:19:16,414 --> 00:19:17,972
Can't we stay here?

184
00:19:18,774 --> 00:19:21,049
Well, it's where we always used to go.

185
00:19:21,854 --> 00:19:24,368
But, you see, I've never
been back there.

186
00:19:25,134 --> 00:19:26,965
It was never
your restaurant, was it?

187
00:19:27,174 --> 00:19:28,402
So you still go there?

188
00:19:28,654 --> 00:19:31,566
Yeah, two or three times a week.
It's convenient.

189
00:19:33,134 --> 00:19:34,567
Let's go.

190
00:19:42,574 --> 00:19:44,292
- Sorry about that.
- It's all right.

191
00:20:05,694 --> 00:20:10,609
A pleasure to see you, sir. It's been
so long, I thought you'd forgotten us.

192
00:20:10,934 --> 00:20:12,128
I was afraid you'd say that.

193
00:20:12,334 --> 00:20:14,643
And you, ma'am.
It's been a long time too.

194
00:20:14,854 --> 00:20:16,765
Two years, Alfred.

195
00:20:20,934 --> 00:20:22,970
- There.
- Thank you.

196
00:20:34,854 --> 00:20:36,412
Why did you lie?

197
00:20:36,654 --> 00:20:39,373
- About my coming here?
- Yes.

198
00:20:39,654 --> 00:20:41,565
Why did you want to meet?

199
00:20:44,214 --> 00:20:46,569
I wanted to ask you about Henry.

200
00:20:49,854 --> 00:20:51,526
I'm worried about him.

201
00:20:51,854 --> 00:20:55,005
How did you find him the other night?
Was he strange at all?

202
00:20:55,214 --> 00:20:57,364
I didn't notice anything wrong.

203
00:20:58,454 --> 00:21:02,003
I wanted to ask you,
but I know you're very busy...

204
00:21:02,254 --> 00:21:05,929
whether you could look him up
occasionally. I think he's lonely.

205
00:21:06,454 --> 00:21:07,773
With you?

206
00:21:08,454 --> 00:21:12,367
You know he's never really noticed me.
Not for years.

207
00:21:14,014 --> 00:21:16,164
Maybe you've given him reason.

208
00:21:17,454 --> 00:21:19,570
What reason could I give?

209
00:21:23,214 --> 00:21:25,364
What reason did you give me?

210
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:30,773
None.

211
00:21:34,054 --> 00:21:35,646
- Are you on a new book?
- Of course.

212
00:21:35,854 --> 00:21:38,527
It's not about us?
The one you threatened to write?

213
00:21:38,734 --> 00:21:42,090
A book takes a year to write.
It's too hard work for revenge.

214
00:21:42,454 --> 00:21:44,490
If you knew how little
you had to revenge.

215
00:21:44,694 --> 00:21:48,164
No, I'm joking.
We had a good time together.

216
00:21:48,374 --> 00:21:51,093
We're adults, and we knew
it had to end sometime.

217
00:21:51,734 --> 00:21:55,170
And now we can lunch
and talk about Henry.

218
00:22:04,494 --> 00:22:05,290
Sorry.

219
00:22:05,534 --> 00:22:08,765
This was stupid.
I really shouldn't have called.

220
00:22:09,254 --> 00:22:10,972
That cough needs attending to.

221
00:22:11,214 --> 00:22:12,442
It's only a cough.

222
00:22:14,134 --> 00:22:15,567
Goodbye, Maurice.

223
00:22:23,414 --> 00:22:24,767
Your menu, sir.

224
00:22:29,974 --> 00:22:31,373
I'm sorry. You have to realize...

225
00:22:31,574 --> 00:22:34,850
I'm jealous of everything that moves.
I'm jealous of the rain.

226
00:22:35,054 --> 00:22:37,568
How can you be jealous of the rain?

227
00:22:55,454 --> 00:22:57,126
Where did you get it?

228
00:22:57,454 --> 00:23:01,367
Spain. That was my war, I'm afraid.

229
00:23:01,574 --> 00:23:03,246
It finished me off for this one.

230
00:23:03,454 --> 00:23:06,366
You were shot. How romantic.

231
00:23:06,574 --> 00:23:09,134
Not really.
They put a pin inside me.

232
00:23:10,014 --> 00:23:13,404
I wondered about the limp.
Could I grow to love it?

233
00:23:13,654 --> 00:23:14,973
And have you?

234
00:23:15,654 --> 00:23:19,329
I have never, ever loved anyone
as much as you.

235
00:23:39,814 --> 00:23:40,769
Yes?

236
00:23:42,534 --> 00:23:44,923
Mr. Parkis to see you, sir.

237
00:23:45,454 --> 00:23:46,409
Show him in.

238
00:23:46,654 --> 00:23:48,372
This way, please.

239
00:23:53,054 --> 00:23:54,612
I'll be with you in a minute, Mr...?

240
00:23:54,854 --> 00:23:56,572
The name's Parkis.

241
00:23:57,374 --> 00:23:59,171
Mr. Savage's man.

242
00:23:59,934 --> 00:24:02,368
Sit down. Take a cigarette.

243
00:24:02,854 --> 00:24:06,608
No, not on duty, sir.
Unless for purposes of concealment.

244
00:24:06,854 --> 00:24:08,651
But you're not on duty now.

245
00:24:08,974 --> 00:24:11,090
Well, in a manner of speaking,
yes, sir.

246
00:24:11,334 --> 00:24:14,167
I've been relieved for half
an hour while I make my report.

247
00:24:16,454 --> 00:24:18,763
So there's something to report?

248
00:24:19,014 --> 00:24:20,686
It's not quite a blank sheet, sir.

249
00:24:23,854 --> 00:24:25,367
Have we met somewhere before?

250
00:24:27,174 --> 00:24:28,573
I don't think so.

251
00:24:35,054 --> 00:24:38,330
Like I say, sir,
it's not quite a blank sheet.

252
00:24:38,854 --> 00:24:40,572
But then it never is.

253
00:24:42,934 --> 00:24:45,129
Me and my boy, we followed...

254
00:24:45,374 --> 00:24:46,693
Your boy?

255
00:24:47,574 --> 00:24:49,166
My son, sir.

256
00:24:50,254 --> 00:24:53,371
I'm teaching him the business.

257
00:24:53,574 --> 00:24:56,964
I mean, a boy can be useful
in all sorts of ways.

258
00:24:57,614 --> 00:25:01,209
On the day in question, the party
went by tube to Piccadilly...

259
00:25:02,454 --> 00:25:04,684
and proceeded to the
Park Lane Hotel.

260
00:25:04,934 --> 00:25:07,767
She seemed quite agitated.

261
00:25:08,734 --> 00:25:11,202
She met a gentleman with whom
she was obviously quite close...

262
00:25:11,454 --> 00:25:15,242
since they greeted each other with
an affectionate lack of ceremony.

263
00:25:15,454 --> 00:25:16,887
And at one point...

264
00:25:17,134 --> 00:25:20,365
although I cannot be certain,
held hands along the bar.

265
00:25:21,774 --> 00:25:22,968
They held hands?

266
00:25:23,214 --> 00:25:26,650
Yes, sir. The gentleman pushed
the lady's glass towards her...

267
00:25:28,574 --> 00:25:32,010
and the hand sort of stayed there
for some time, sir...

268
00:25:32,254 --> 00:25:34,210
which indicates
a squeeze of that nature.

269
00:25:36,654 --> 00:25:40,886
And after a short conversation, they
proceeded to a restaurant called...

270
00:25:41,334 --> 00:25:45,566
Palmer's, which was difficult to gain
access to, with the boy and all.

271
00:25:45,814 --> 00:25:47,611
I observed them through the window.

272
00:25:48,654 --> 00:25:51,452
And after a while, the lady left...

273
00:25:51,654 --> 00:25:55,772
laboring, it seemed to me,
under great emotion.

274
00:25:56,334 --> 00:25:58,973
Great emotion.
You're sure of that?

275
00:25:59,214 --> 00:26:00,363
Without doubt, sir.

276
00:26:00,574 --> 00:26:03,930
Then I followed her down
Charing Cross Road to Maiden Lane...

277
00:26:04,334 --> 00:26:08,964
where she turned into a church
for what I presume was a good cry.

278
00:26:10,054 --> 00:26:12,966
- She's not a Roman, is she, sir?
- No.

279
00:26:13,334 --> 00:26:17,486
Thought not.
She didn't kneel, sir, but sat.

280
00:26:17,734 --> 00:26:21,807
And from the angle of her face,
I could tell tears were an issue.

281
00:26:22,694 --> 00:26:24,127
Forgive the personal touch.

282
00:26:24,414 --> 00:26:25,688
Of course.

283
00:26:27,214 --> 00:26:30,490
You see, I like the lady,
the party in question.

284
00:26:30,934 --> 00:26:33,528
As did I, but you were wrong
about the hands.

285
00:26:33,774 --> 00:26:35,571
The hands, sir?

286
00:26:36,134 --> 00:26:38,694
We never so much as touched hands.

287
00:26:40,774 --> 00:26:41,604
Oh, dear.

288
00:26:41,854 --> 00:26:43,207
I've made a fool of myself.

289
00:26:43,414 --> 00:26:47,965
Well, Sarah has that effect.
Mr. Savage should've introduced us.

290
00:26:48,614 --> 00:26:49,842
Oh, no, sir.

291
00:26:50,654 --> 00:26:51,928
It was up to me.

292
00:26:52,574 --> 00:26:53,609
Well, it's not serious.

293
00:26:53,814 --> 00:26:56,487
If you look at it from the outside,
it's quite funny.

294
00:26:57,054 --> 00:26:58,772
But I'm on the inside, sir.

295
00:27:00,374 --> 00:27:03,730
It's not Mr. Savage I'm worried about
so much. It's my boy, sir.

296
00:27:05,134 --> 00:27:06,852
When I tell him
you're the husband...

297
00:27:07,054 --> 00:27:08,965
But you're wrong.

298
00:27:09,214 --> 00:27:11,250
I'm acting on the husband's behalf.

299
00:27:11,654 --> 00:27:14,043
So you've requested
an investigation of yourself?

300
00:27:14,854 --> 00:27:16,606
It's an interesting paradox.

301
00:27:16,854 --> 00:27:18,606
Who's the wronged party then?

302
00:27:22,374 --> 00:27:23,363
Pardon me, sir.

303
00:27:25,054 --> 00:27:27,170
I am slow in such matters.

304
00:27:27,534 --> 00:27:30,731
You've both been supplanted
in that lady's affections by...

305
00:27:30,974 --> 00:27:32,373
Another?

306
00:27:34,374 --> 00:27:37,172
Try to think of it
the way I do, Mr. Parkis.

307
00:27:38,854 --> 00:27:41,766
Jealousy can only exist with desire.

308
00:27:42,654 --> 00:27:44,963
You are on a hunt for desire.

309
00:27:45,854 --> 00:27:48,322
Just regard yourself as its servant.

310
00:27:49,574 --> 00:27:51,963
Of course, sir. That's my job.

311
00:27:52,854 --> 00:27:54,173
Thank you.

312
00:28:05,174 --> 00:28:07,893
The vicarious lover, Parkis.

313
00:28:08,574 --> 00:28:10,769
- Good night, sir.
- Good night.

314
00:28:18,334 --> 00:28:21,053
I wondered how much of her
he could reclaim for me.

315
00:28:22,374 --> 00:28:24,808
For a moment, I wished I was him...

316
00:28:25,014 --> 00:28:28,290
shining his searchlight
around her world.

317
00:28:34,454 --> 00:28:36,968
I am a jealous man.

318
00:28:50,054 --> 00:28:52,693
- I'm jealous of this stocking.
- Why?

319
00:28:53,534 --> 00:28:55,411
Because it does what I can't.

320
00:28:56,374 --> 00:28:58,365
Kisses your whole leg.

321
00:29:01,414 --> 00:29:04,406
And I'm jealous of this button.

322
00:29:04,654 --> 00:29:06,372
Poor, innocent button.

323
00:29:06,574 --> 00:29:07,848
It's not innocent at all.

324
00:29:09,254 --> 00:29:12,405
It's with you all day. I'm not.

325
00:29:18,134 --> 00:29:20,648
I suppose you're jealous of my shoes.

326
00:29:21,734 --> 00:29:23,292
Why?

327
00:29:24,854 --> 00:29:26,970
Because they'll take you away from me.

328
00:29:28,774 --> 00:29:32,084
I measured love by
the extent of my jealousy.

329
00:29:32,334 --> 00:29:33,608
And as my jealousy was infinite...

330
00:29:33,854 --> 00:29:35,173
Anyone who loves is jealous.

331
00:29:35,414 --> 00:29:37,530
My love should be infinite too.

332
00:29:37,774 --> 00:29:39,253
I hate you being unhappy.

333
00:29:39,454 --> 00:29:42,969
- I don't mind what makes you happy.
- If I slept with someone else?

334
00:29:43,174 --> 00:29:45,813
That's neither here nor there.
I want you to be happy.

335
00:29:46,054 --> 00:29:47,726
Maybe you'd want to do the same.

336
00:29:47,934 --> 00:29:50,050
- I never would.
- But you do.

337
00:29:50,254 --> 00:29:53,007
- Do what?
- Sleep with someone else.

338
00:29:53,254 --> 00:29:55,973
You mean Henry?
How can anyone be jealous of Henry?

339
00:29:56,254 --> 00:29:59,007
He has you. I don't.

340
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:02,411
We inhabit the same house,
that's all. You know that.

341
00:30:02,614 --> 00:30:04,252
I'm the shadow he walks around.

342
00:30:05,054 --> 00:30:05,884
And I love you.

343
00:30:06,134 --> 00:30:08,648
I'd rather see you dead
than with another man.

344
00:30:08,854 --> 00:30:11,573
I will never, ever be
with another man!

345
00:30:12,214 --> 00:30:16,002
You may see me dead, but I will
never be with another man.

346
00:30:16,974 --> 00:30:18,373
We should go to the shelter.

347
00:30:18,614 --> 00:30:20,764
If a bomb hit, think of what
wouldn't happen.

348
00:30:20,974 --> 00:30:25,365
You wouldn't walk back to Henry.
I'd never imagine another lover.

349
00:30:26,054 --> 00:30:29,364
- My jealousy would end.
- Would that make you happy?

350
00:31:57,014 --> 00:31:58,766
Do you believe me now?

351
00:32:05,414 --> 00:32:08,167
But, sadly, I didn't believe her.

352
00:32:08,414 --> 00:32:11,611
There was a devil in my mind
that would never let me.

353
00:32:11,854 --> 00:32:15,767
And now I had Parkis' boy
playing the devil's game.

354
00:33:52,174 --> 00:33:56,133
My boy managed to gain access, sir.
Remarkably useful, he can be.

355
00:33:56,334 --> 00:33:57,813
I call that Exhibit A.

356
00:33:58,014 --> 00:34:02,451
They say a promise is forever, but
I don't know if I can keep this one.

357
00:34:02,694 --> 00:34:05,731
He killed me with jealousy.
You're killing me with love.

358
00:34:05,934 --> 00:34:08,494
So he's got the scent too, Parkis.

359
00:34:09,174 --> 00:34:11,369
- What scent?
- The scent of love.

360
00:34:11,574 --> 00:34:13,804
Stalking it like a retriever.

361
00:34:14,414 --> 00:34:16,644
Well, he's remarkably persistent, sir.

362
00:34:17,574 --> 00:34:21,169
He observed the party in question
in a state of partial undress...

363
00:34:21,374 --> 00:34:23,444
with an unidentified male.

364
00:34:23,654 --> 00:34:25,849
- Where?
- In the bedroom, sir.

365
00:34:26,094 --> 00:34:28,847
The male party closed the door,
and my boy made his exit.

366
00:34:29,054 --> 00:34:33,206
The implication, and I think you would
agree, is that intimacy was...

367
00:34:35,254 --> 00:34:36,448
imminent.

368
00:34:36,814 --> 00:34:38,770
Indeed. Who is he?

369
00:34:38,974 --> 00:34:41,090
Here is where our progress was made.

370
00:34:41,894 --> 00:34:45,011
My boy glanced at the appointment
book in the front hallway.

371
00:34:45,494 --> 00:34:49,282
The party in question had a dental
appointment at 3:30 the following day.

372
00:34:49,494 --> 00:34:54,409
And in fact, she visited, at 3:30,
a premises on 65 Cedar Road...

373
00:34:54,974 --> 00:34:57,534
where no dentist's sign
was in evidence.

374
00:35:14,814 --> 00:35:16,645
A Mr. Smythe owns the premises, sir.

375
00:35:16,894 --> 00:35:19,533
Smythe. With a "Y"?

376
00:35:19,774 --> 00:35:22,607
Yes, sir. S-M-Y-T-H-E.

377
00:35:29,134 --> 00:35:32,251
Though we have no evidence
of intimacy...

378
00:35:32,494 --> 00:35:34,644
the implication is clearly there.

379
00:35:34,974 --> 00:35:36,566
Well, how is it there?

380
00:35:36,774 --> 00:35:38,730
The fictitious dental appointment.

381
00:35:41,614 --> 00:35:43,093
Exhibit B.

382
00:35:43,774 --> 00:35:45,332
My boy took that.

383
00:35:47,214 --> 00:35:49,853
And the party in question
emerged two hours later.

384
00:35:50,374 --> 00:35:54,731
Passage of time being amply sufficient
for intimacy to have taken place.

385
00:35:55,814 --> 00:35:58,123
The courts generally demand
at least an hour, sir.

386
00:35:59,374 --> 00:36:02,684
My boy would have photographed
her re-emergence...

387
00:36:02,894 --> 00:36:06,933
but for the unfortunate occurrence
of him falling asleep.

388
00:36:12,214 --> 00:36:16,810
Luckily, sir, the party in question
mistook him for an abandoned urchin...

389
00:36:17,054 --> 00:36:18,885
and led him
to the tube station.

390
00:36:19,094 --> 00:36:22,006
So the time of re-emergence
is definitely established...

391
00:36:22,254 --> 00:36:25,644
as was an acquaintance, which
may have its uses in the future.

392
00:36:26,694 --> 00:36:29,367
Should I confront him
like an injured husband?

393
00:36:29,614 --> 00:36:32,924
I'm against it, sir.
It complicates things in the courts.

394
00:36:33,534 --> 00:36:34,853
This will never reach court.

395
00:36:35,374 --> 00:36:37,934
- An amicable settlement.
- There's lack of interest.

396
00:36:38,174 --> 00:36:41,211
One can hardly make a fuss
about a man called Smythe.

397
00:36:42,094 --> 00:36:44,130
I'd just like to see him, that's all.

398
00:36:44,334 --> 00:36:47,087
Perhaps Lance can oblige us
next time with a frontal.

399
00:36:47,294 --> 00:36:49,250
- Lance?
- My boy.

400
00:36:50,134 --> 00:36:52,011
Called after Lancelot.
The Round Table.

401
00:36:52,814 --> 00:36:54,406
He found the Holy Grail.

402
00:36:54,614 --> 00:36:57,970
That was Galahad. Lancelot was found
in bed with Guinevere.

403
00:37:00,734 --> 00:37:02,326
I hadn't heard.

404
00:37:15,494 --> 00:37:18,566
I have to say, sir,
I would advise against it.

405
00:37:18,814 --> 00:37:22,602
I'd just like to see what a man
called Smythe looks like.

406
00:37:23,174 --> 00:37:24,926
Will you lend me your boy?

407
00:37:26,174 --> 00:37:29,484
If you'll assure me there'll be
nothing unpleasant.

408
00:37:29,694 --> 00:37:33,767
Well, Sarah isn't there. This scene
will have a universal certificate.

409
00:37:33,974 --> 00:37:35,373
Come with me, young Lancelot.

410
00:37:36,814 --> 00:37:38,133
Go on, Lance.

411
00:37:39,014 --> 00:37:40,527
No need to worry.

412
00:37:41,254 --> 00:37:43,131
You're feeling ill, remember?

413
00:37:43,334 --> 00:37:44,244
How ill, sir?

414
00:37:44,454 --> 00:37:47,446
Ill enough to faint.
Can you act that?

415
00:37:48,014 --> 00:37:49,766
If I hold my breath, I can go pale.

416
00:37:49,974 --> 00:37:51,327
Good.

417
00:38:01,894 --> 00:38:03,964
Excuse me, but does
a Dr. Wilson live here?

418
00:38:04,614 --> 00:38:05,603
I'm afraid he doesn't.

419
00:38:05,854 --> 00:38:09,164
I was given this address,
and my boy's quite ill.

420
00:38:11,094 --> 00:38:12,413
- You all right?
- Come in.

421
00:38:12,614 --> 00:38:16,163
Would you mind? I'm sorry.
He needs to sit down, perhaps.

422
00:38:16,374 --> 00:38:17,727
Thank you.

423
00:38:21,894 --> 00:38:23,725
Can I fetch him a glass of water?

424
00:38:23,934 --> 00:38:25,253
That's very kind.

425
00:38:25,454 --> 00:38:27,172
Or some orange squash?

426
00:38:27,374 --> 00:38:28,568
Water will be fine.

427
00:38:28,814 --> 00:38:29,963
Orange squash, please.

428
00:38:30,614 --> 00:38:32,172
Say thank you, Arthur.

429
00:38:32,374 --> 00:38:33,602
Is his name Arthur?

430
00:38:33,854 --> 00:38:37,290
Yes, Arthur James. His mother
was fond of Tennyson.

431
00:38:37,494 --> 00:38:38,290
Is she...?

432
00:38:38,894 --> 00:38:40,964
Yes, yes. Four years now.

433
00:38:42,774 --> 00:38:44,492
He must be a great comfort to you.

434
00:38:44,694 --> 00:38:45,524
And anxiety.

435
00:38:45,774 --> 00:38:47,924
I ought to introduce myself.

436
00:38:48,174 --> 00:38:50,210
- Bridges.
- My name is Smythe.

437
00:38:50,454 --> 00:38:51,250
With a "Y"?

438
00:38:52,214 --> 00:38:54,967
This is my brother, Richard.
This is Mr. Bridges.

439
00:38:55,214 --> 00:38:56,852
His boy isn't feeling well.

440
00:38:57,054 --> 00:38:59,887
I was given this address
for a Dr. Wilson.

441
00:39:00,094 --> 00:39:01,925
There's no such doctor here.

442
00:39:04,774 --> 00:39:06,730
I've seen your boy before.

443
00:39:07,334 --> 00:39:09,211
Maybe on the common.

444
00:39:14,694 --> 00:39:16,924
What was the real purpose
of your visit?

445
00:39:20,414 --> 00:39:22,530
I told you, a doctor.

446
00:39:26,414 --> 00:39:28,723
No, you're not ill, are you, boy?

447
00:39:35,174 --> 00:39:39,406
People sometimes come to me
and can't explain why.

448
00:39:41,214 --> 00:39:43,125
But if there is a reason...

449
00:39:43,414 --> 00:39:45,052
- My brother often deals with...
- Hush, Susan.

450
00:39:46,214 --> 00:39:48,523
They must ask themselves.

451
00:39:52,574 --> 00:39:55,327
I recognize your boy.
But you...

452
00:39:56,774 --> 00:39:58,526
Who recommended you?

453
00:39:58,894 --> 00:40:00,885
We have a friend in common.

454
00:40:01,094 --> 00:40:02,925
Sarah Mlles.

455
00:40:04,974 --> 00:40:06,532
And your name is?

456
00:40:06,734 --> 00:40:08,326
Bendrix.

457
00:40:15,014 --> 00:40:16,208
I know all about you.

458
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:17,403
I'm sure you do.

459
00:40:17,654 --> 00:40:21,772
But you must enlighten me.
Aren't you bound by vows of chastity?

460
00:40:22,014 --> 00:40:23,732
Oh, my dear.

461
00:40:24,614 --> 00:40:26,127
Go, please.

462
00:40:27,014 --> 00:40:28,333
Would you just go?

463
00:40:29,814 --> 00:40:31,930
Come along, Lancelot.

464
00:40:38,014 --> 00:40:40,847
Poor Sarah. She had committed
nothing but love...

465
00:40:41,054 --> 00:40:44,171
and here were Parkis and his boy
watching her every move.

466
00:40:44,374 --> 00:40:46,012
I would've called the spies off...

467
00:40:46,214 --> 00:40:49,729
had the devil not tugged
at my elbow once more.

468
00:40:51,134 --> 00:40:52,567
Still in the rain?

469
00:40:53,014 --> 00:40:55,926
Walking, Bendrix.
Doctor recommends it.

470
00:40:56,134 --> 00:40:57,852
Well, walk with me.

471
00:40:58,094 --> 00:40:59,925
I recommend a drink.

472
00:41:13,294 --> 00:41:14,727
How's Sarah?

473
00:41:15,814 --> 00:41:17,213
Pretty well.

474
00:41:18,014 --> 00:41:20,733
Did you ever consult
that private detective?

475
00:41:21,894 --> 00:41:23,612
I hoped you'd forgotten that.

476
00:41:24,414 --> 00:41:28,009
I was overworked.
I had Royal Commission brewing.

477
00:41:28,254 --> 00:41:30,131
Don't worry, Henry.
I did it for you.

478
00:41:31,814 --> 00:41:33,008
You had no right.

479
00:41:33,254 --> 00:41:35,893
- I'm paying all the charges.
- It's infernal cheek.

480
00:41:36,774 --> 00:41:38,002
Here's the report, Henry.

481
00:41:38,214 --> 00:41:40,774
His name is Smythe with a "Y."

482
00:41:41,214 --> 00:41:43,569
You've been properly
led up the garden path.

483
00:41:43,774 --> 00:41:44,570
Let me pass.

484
00:41:44,814 --> 00:41:47,772
You don't want them? Photographs,
names, love letters?

485
00:41:57,414 --> 00:41:59,132
Now will you let me go?

486
00:42:02,734 --> 00:42:04,929
I can always get you a carbon copy.

487
00:42:21,374 --> 00:42:25,253
Strange how much dignity
there can be in a hat.

488
00:42:26,134 --> 00:42:30,924
Without it, he seemed one of
the anonymous. The dispossessed.

489
00:42:31,574 --> 00:42:34,566
I had pitied myself
for so long, it was...

490
00:42:34,774 --> 00:42:36,924
odd to pity him.

491
00:42:38,134 --> 00:42:39,931
I'm sorry, Henry.

492
00:42:42,694 --> 00:42:44,127
Sit down.

493
00:42:54,814 --> 00:42:57,123
Were you two lovers, Bendrix?

494
00:43:01,614 --> 00:43:03,730
It's the only explanation.

495
00:43:04,814 --> 00:43:06,532
The only excuse too.

496
00:43:10,814 --> 00:43:15,410
Can't you see that what
you've done is monstrous?

497
00:43:21,894 --> 00:43:24,931
You must think me a fool
not to have guessed.

498
00:43:29,574 --> 00:43:31,530
Why didn't she leave me?

499
00:43:32,214 --> 00:43:34,409
Because you're a habit she's formed.

500
00:43:35,214 --> 00:43:37,125
You're her security.

501
00:43:37,494 --> 00:43:38,643
Why did she leave you?

502
00:43:38,854 --> 00:43:41,368
I became a bore like you.

503
00:43:42,214 --> 00:43:45,923
But I wasn't born one.
You created me.

504
00:43:46,534 --> 00:43:49,492
She wouldn't leave you,
so I bored her with my jealousy.

505
00:43:50,814 --> 00:43:52,088
You can't be jealous of me.

506
00:43:52,294 --> 00:43:53,522
Well, you won, in a way.

507
00:43:54,614 --> 00:43:56,684
We had come to the end of love.

508
00:43:57,814 --> 00:44:00,089
She'd only make love with me...

509
00:44:00,534 --> 00:44:04,004
but she could shop and cook
and fall asleep with you.

510
00:44:05,654 --> 00:44:07,929
She's still very fond of you.

511
00:44:08,134 --> 00:44:11,012
One isn't satisfied with fondness.

512
00:44:12,094 --> 00:44:14,164
- I was.
- Yes, and that made you her pimp.

513
00:44:15,894 --> 00:44:20,172
A husband who knows where his slippers
are but never notices his wife.

514
00:44:20,974 --> 00:44:22,692
But you weren't the only pimp.

515
00:44:23,254 --> 00:44:25,927
The war was the greatest pimp of all.

516
00:44:26,694 --> 00:44:29,572
And the V-1 s never affected us...

517
00:44:30,014 --> 00:44:32,323
until the act of love was over.

518
00:45:01,414 --> 00:45:03,484
So what will you do when it ends?

519
00:45:03,934 --> 00:45:05,606
It won't end, I told you.

520
00:45:05,814 --> 00:45:07,372
I meant the war.

521
00:45:08,894 --> 00:45:10,930
It's the only certain thing.

522
00:45:11,694 --> 00:45:13,252
What do you mean?

523
00:45:13,454 --> 00:45:15,331
That allows me to see you.

524
00:45:17,134 --> 00:45:20,809
You think love ends
when you don't see me?

525
00:45:23,494 --> 00:45:25,724
To be is to be perceived.

526
00:45:27,134 --> 00:45:28,852
Do I exist when you're with Henry?

527
00:45:29,054 --> 00:45:29,964
Yes.

528
00:45:31,214 --> 00:45:35,651
Isn't that why you stay with Henry?
Because you know this will end?

529
00:45:35,854 --> 00:45:36,809
No.

530
00:45:40,334 --> 00:45:42,564
- Let's go to the basement.
- My landlady's there.

531
00:45:42,814 --> 00:45:43,883
- Does it matter?
- To her.

532
00:45:44,294 --> 00:45:46,046
- It's close, Maurice.
- I'll check.

533
00:45:46,254 --> 00:45:49,132
- Let me go with you.
- I'll be one second.

534
00:45:58,534 --> 00:45:59,853
Nobody's there.
It's clear.

535
00:46:51,414 --> 00:46:53,530
I never heard the bang.

536
00:46:54,694 --> 00:46:59,290
I awoke after five minutes
or five seconds...

537
00:47:00,774 --> 00:47:02,924
to a changed world.

538
00:47:07,494 --> 00:47:10,804
For a moment, I was free of feeling...

539
00:47:11,694 --> 00:47:15,528
love, hate, jealousy.

540
00:47:16,414 --> 00:47:19,724
And it all felt like happiness.

541
00:48:26,734 --> 00:48:28,452
Oh, my God.

542
00:48:30,614 --> 00:48:32,127
You're alive?

543
00:48:36,174 --> 00:48:37,892
You sound disappointed.

544
00:48:38,094 --> 00:48:39,812
You're hurt.

545
00:48:44,374 --> 00:48:46,729
I just cut myself, that's all.

546
00:48:58,134 --> 00:49:00,125
What were you doing on the floor?

547
00:49:01,814 --> 00:49:03,327
Praying.

548
00:49:04,174 --> 00:49:05,573
To what?

549
00:49:05,774 --> 00:49:07,844
To anything that might exist.

550
00:49:10,254 --> 00:49:13,291
It'd have been more practical
to have come downstairs.

551
00:49:13,934 --> 00:49:15,162
I did.

552
00:49:19,574 --> 00:49:21,292
Well, why didn't you wake me?

553
00:49:22,694 --> 00:49:24,127
I tried.

554
00:49:25,014 --> 00:49:26,527
You didn't move.

555
00:49:28,294 --> 00:49:29,693
I don't understand.

556
00:49:31,014 --> 00:49:33,323
I knew for certain you were dead.

557
00:49:34,214 --> 00:49:36,967
There wasn't much to pray for
then, was there?

558
00:49:37,214 --> 00:49:38,283
A miracle.

559
00:49:40,614 --> 00:49:43,128
And we don't believe in those.

560
00:49:44,174 --> 00:49:45,527
No.

561
00:49:47,534 --> 00:49:50,128
And that siren means you go.

562
00:49:53,174 --> 00:49:54,573
Yes.

563
00:50:00,334 --> 00:50:01,528
Please don't.

564
00:50:02,414 --> 00:50:05,133
I have to. Henry will...

565
00:50:05,694 --> 00:50:06,763
Forget Henry.

566
00:50:08,734 --> 00:50:10,406
You don't understand.
You were gone.

567
00:50:10,974 --> 00:50:11,804
Now I'm back.

568
00:50:13,014 --> 00:50:15,369
I'm sorry to disappoint you, Sarah.

569
00:50:20,494 --> 00:50:22,883
Love doesn't end...

570
00:50:23,094 --> 00:50:25,164
just because we don't
see each other.

571
00:50:26,094 --> 00:50:27,209
Doesn't it?

572
00:50:27,654 --> 00:50:29,770
People go on loving God, don't they?

573
00:50:30,014 --> 00:50:33,927
All their lives, without seeing Him.

574
00:50:35,414 --> 00:50:37,564
That's not my kind of love.

575
00:50:38,374 --> 00:50:40,729
Maybe there's no other kind.

576
00:50:53,894 --> 00:50:56,533
So I was a disappointment in the end.

577
00:50:56,774 --> 00:51:00,449
I lived. And that was
the end of the affair...

578
00:51:00,814 --> 00:51:04,124
until I met you with that
detective's card in your hand.

579
00:51:05,214 --> 00:51:07,091
I wondered why we hadn't seen you.

580
00:51:10,614 --> 00:51:13,526
You should go home, Henry.
You'll catch your death.

581
00:51:17,414 --> 00:51:18,733
I'm sorry.

582
00:51:39,974 --> 00:51:42,488
It was quite easy, sir.
There was such a crush.

583
00:51:42,814 --> 00:51:45,374
Mrs. Miles thought
I was from the ministry.

584
00:51:45,654 --> 00:51:48,168
Mr. Miles thought
I was one of her friends.

585
00:51:49,294 --> 00:51:51,364
I knew the way to her room
from my boy.

586
00:51:52,294 --> 00:51:54,808
Anybody would've stopped me, I
would've been looking for the toilet.

587
00:51:55,014 --> 00:51:56,333
Of course, nobody did.

588
00:51:56,614 --> 00:51:59,082
Did you think it was
a good cocktail party?

589
00:51:59,294 --> 00:52:01,444
Highly successful, I would say, sir.

590
00:52:01,774 --> 00:52:04,004
But Mrs. Miles looked
a bit out of sorts.

591
00:52:05,374 --> 00:52:06,932
I refer to this...

592
00:52:08,054 --> 00:52:09,328
as Exhibit D.

593
00:52:21,494 --> 00:52:22,813
Did you look at it?

594
00:52:23,054 --> 00:52:25,090
I ascertained its nature, sir.

595
00:52:25,294 --> 00:52:27,444
I judged she wasn't the cautious type.

596
00:52:27,654 --> 00:52:29,770
So happy. M returns today.

597
00:52:29,974 --> 00:52:33,205
My experience of diaries is, they
always give things away, sir.

598
00:52:34,334 --> 00:52:37,007
People invent their little codes.
You see through them.

599
00:52:37,214 --> 00:52:39,205
I woke up and the sun was shining.

600
00:52:39,414 --> 00:52:41,405
This covers several years.

601
00:52:42,294 --> 00:52:43,522
I hope you're satisfied, sir.

602
00:52:43,734 --> 00:52:47,204
Life was going to be happy again,
but last night I dreamt...

603
00:52:47,414 --> 00:52:50,486
I think this may well close
our account, Parkis.

604
00:52:51,574 --> 00:52:53,132
I had a feeling it might, sir.

605
00:52:54,414 --> 00:52:57,008
I have enjoyed our association, sir...

606
00:52:57,214 --> 00:53:00,286
if one can talk of enjoying
under the sad circumstances.

607
00:53:00,494 --> 00:53:01,813
As have I.

608
00:53:02,294 --> 00:53:05,411
So I hope you wouldn't
resent a memento, sir.

609
00:53:11,014 --> 00:53:14,245
There's quite a history with that.
Do you remember the Bolton case?

610
00:53:14,814 --> 00:53:16,167
I can't say I do.

611
00:53:16,374 --> 00:53:18,683
It caused quite a stir
at the time, sir.

612
00:53:18,894 --> 00:53:23,251
Lady Bolton, her maid and the man,
all discovered together.

613
00:53:23,534 --> 00:53:25,843
That ashtray stood
beside the bed, sir.

614
00:53:26,094 --> 00:53:27,812
On the lady's side.

615
00:53:32,414 --> 00:53:34,609
I shall treasure it, Parkis.

616
00:53:35,894 --> 00:53:37,805
If ashtrays could speak, sir.

617
00:53:38,414 --> 00:53:39,813
Indeed.

618
00:53:43,214 --> 00:53:46,206
I'll call later to make sure
there were no loose ends.

619
00:53:46,414 --> 00:53:47,733
Thank you, Parkis.

620
00:53:50,614 --> 00:53:53,003
- Good night, sir.
- Good night.

621
00:54:22,094 --> 00:54:25,882
Sometimes I get tired of trying
to convince him that I love him...

622
00:54:26,094 --> 00:54:28,050
and shall love him forever.

623
00:54:28,254 --> 00:54:31,485
He pounces on my words
like a barrister and twists them.

624
00:54:31,694 --> 00:54:33,650
So what will you do when it ends?

625
00:54:33,934 --> 00:54:37,051
You think love ends
when you don't see me?

626
00:54:39,294 --> 00:54:41,808
To be is to be perceived.

627
00:54:42,654 --> 00:54:44,849
Do I exist when you're with Henry?

628
00:54:45,054 --> 00:54:46,089
Yes.

629
00:54:47,534 --> 00:54:51,925
Isn't that why you stay with Henry?
Because you know this will end?

630
00:54:52,134 --> 00:54:53,169
No.

631
00:54:55,854 --> 00:54:58,209
- Let's go to the basement.
- My landlady's there.

632
00:54:58,414 --> 00:54:59,688
- Does it matter?
- To her.

633
00:54:59,894 --> 00:55:01,646
- It's close, Maurice.
- I'll check.

634
00:55:01,894 --> 00:55:04,613
- Let me go with you.
- I'll be one second.

635
00:55:14,654 --> 00:55:16,133
Nobody's there.
It's clear.

636
00:55:49,734 --> 00:55:52,612
Oh, God.
Oh, God, don't take him.

637
00:56:03,374 --> 00:56:05,012
Oh, God, don't take him.

638
00:56:05,614 --> 00:56:06,888
But you had.

639
00:56:10,494 --> 00:56:14,407
Whatever was him was gone.
You'd taken it.

640
00:56:17,614 --> 00:56:20,003
I'd never believed in prayer.

641
00:56:22,854 --> 00:56:26,563
Oh, God, please bring him back.
Let him live.

642
00:56:26,854 --> 00:56:30,483
I don't believe in you,
but please let him live.

643
00:56:32,574 --> 00:56:34,610
Dear God, please.

644
00:56:51,534 --> 00:56:55,413
Dear God, please, let him live.

645
00:56:57,694 --> 00:57:00,003
Please bring him back.

646
00:57:01,254 --> 00:57:03,814
Please don't take him.

647
00:57:06,294 --> 00:57:11,209
I'll give him up forever.
Only, please let him be alive.

648
00:57:11,934 --> 00:57:13,447
Let him live...

649
00:57:13,694 --> 00:57:17,209
and I promise I'll never
see him again.

650
00:57:24,854 --> 00:57:26,606
Oh, my God.

651
00:57:28,614 --> 00:57:30,206
You're alive?

652
00:57:32,814 --> 00:57:34,452
You sound disappointed.

653
00:57:35,174 --> 00:57:37,051
But if he was alive...

654
00:57:37,294 --> 00:57:39,410
now I was dead.

655
00:57:47,694 --> 00:57:49,605
What were you doing on the floor?

656
00:57:51,494 --> 00:57:52,813
Praying.

657
00:57:53,694 --> 00:57:55,013
To what?

658
00:57:55,374 --> 00:57:57,205
To anything that might exist.

659
00:57:57,654 --> 00:58:01,408
How could I explain to him
what made no sense to me?

660
00:58:01,614 --> 00:58:02,967
You didn't move.

661
00:58:03,614 --> 00:58:06,003
I knew for certain you were dead.

662
00:58:06,574 --> 00:58:08,451
There wasn't much to pray for then?

663
00:58:08,694 --> 00:58:10,047
A miracle.

664
00:58:11,854 --> 00:58:14,004
And we don't believe in that.

665
00:58:14,934 --> 00:58:16,208
No.

666
00:58:18,054 --> 00:58:19,965
And that siren means you go.

667
00:58:22,774 --> 00:58:23,729
Yes.

668
00:58:25,254 --> 00:58:30,169
And I knew that nothing in this world
would make sense to me again.

669
00:58:31,254 --> 00:58:32,369
Sorry to disappoint you.

670
00:58:37,214 --> 00:58:39,011
Love doesn't end...

671
00:58:39,894 --> 00:58:41,646
just because we don't
see each other.

672
00:58:42,774 --> 00:58:44,002
Doesn't it?

673
00:58:44,214 --> 00:58:46,284
People go on loving God, don't they?

674
00:58:46,534 --> 00:58:50,129
All their lives, without seeing Him.

675
00:58:50,334 --> 00:58:53,132
That's not my kind of love.

676
00:58:54,014 --> 00:58:56,209
Maybe there's no other kind.

677
00:59:16,174 --> 00:59:18,529
I can't be held to that promise.

678
00:59:19,094 --> 00:59:21,449
But something told me I would be.

679
00:59:21,894 --> 00:59:26,251
I had tempted fate,
and fate had accepted.

680
00:59:26,974 --> 00:59:31,650
So I was in the desert now,
the desert without him.

681
00:59:33,694 --> 00:59:35,730
I started a tour with Henry.

682
00:59:35,974 --> 00:59:37,930
Civil defence in southern England.

683
00:59:38,894 --> 00:59:43,410
Henry and I sleeping side by side
like figures on tombs.

684
00:59:45,574 --> 00:59:48,452
In the new reinforced shelter
at Bigwell-on-Sea...

685
00:59:48,694 --> 00:59:50,525
the chief warden kissed me.

686
00:59:51,414 --> 00:59:54,804
I allowed him to but felt nothing.

687
00:59:56,054 --> 01:00:00,889
I'm beginning to believe in you, God.
And maybe that's how you work.

688
01:00:01,574 --> 01:00:05,010
You empty me of love,
then fill that emptiness.

689
01:00:05,214 --> 01:00:07,284
They're recommending me for an OBE.

690
01:00:07,534 --> 01:00:11,209
- What's that?
- A step below a CBE.

691
01:00:11,614 --> 01:00:14,765
When I retire,
I'll probably be a KBE.

692
01:00:15,054 --> 01:00:18,490
It's confusing. Couldn't they
stick to the same letters?

693
01:00:19,774 --> 01:00:22,208
Wouldn't you like to be Lady Mlles?

694
01:00:25,694 --> 01:00:28,128
This was the British people's
finest day:

695
01:00:28,374 --> 01:00:31,605
V- E Day, the end of the German war.

696
01:00:34,694 --> 01:00:39,609
A man we have seen before looked down
from a balcony in Whitehall.

697
01:00:51,214 --> 01:00:54,172
The whole of London seemed happy
because there was peace...

698
01:00:54,374 --> 01:00:56,251
and there were no more bombs.

699
01:00:56,894 --> 01:00:59,203
But I'm not sure I liked the peace.

700
01:01:07,294 --> 01:01:09,410
I walked his walks...

701
01:01:12,054 --> 01:01:14,409
tried to think where he'd be.

702
01:01:19,494 --> 01:01:21,007
Then I gave up.

703
01:01:22,814 --> 01:01:25,408
I thought that now
the world is at peace...

704
01:01:26,014 --> 01:01:28,209
maybe I should have some.

705
01:01:40,054 --> 01:01:42,010
I told him it all.

706
01:01:42,214 --> 01:01:46,002
And whoever heard my promise
must have heard it too...

707
01:01:46,774 --> 01:01:49,129
and must have known it already...

708
01:01:49,374 --> 01:01:52,411
since God knows everything.

709
01:01:54,694 --> 01:01:57,208
How cruel that knowledge seemed.

710
01:01:57,854 --> 01:02:01,403
It knew what I would say
before I made that promise.

711
01:02:02,374 --> 01:02:04,604
Knew it would keep me to it.

712
01:02:05,494 --> 01:02:08,213
Knew me the way his hands knew me.

713
01:02:09,054 --> 01:02:11,010
Sarah, darling.

714
01:02:13,574 --> 01:02:14,370
You.

715
01:02:14,574 --> 01:02:17,088
Knew I would meet him
on the stairs.

716
01:02:18,454 --> 01:02:19,523
It's a filthy night.

717
01:02:19,774 --> 01:02:22,493
You're wet through, Sarah. One day
you'll catch your death of cold.

718
01:02:22,694 --> 01:02:23,809
Good night.

719
01:02:24,694 --> 01:02:26,810
Knew he would hate me.

720
01:02:33,054 --> 01:02:36,012
- Wednesday.
- Wednesday. Let me check.

721
01:02:37,654 --> 01:02:39,724
- Would Thursday do?
- Thursday then.

722
01:02:39,974 --> 01:02:42,010
The Park Lane Hotel at 1?

723
01:02:46,494 --> 01:02:50,806
I took my time.
I didn't want to be early.

724
01:02:51,534 --> 01:02:53,206
Why did you want to meet?

725
01:02:53,414 --> 01:02:57,532
I wanted to tell you I'd been dead
for the last two years.

726
01:02:58,094 --> 01:03:00,608
I can't be without you any longer.

727
01:03:02,374 --> 01:03:04,410
But, of course, I didn't.

728
01:03:04,614 --> 01:03:07,731
He's never really noticed me.
Not for years.

729
01:03:09,974 --> 01:03:12,044
Maybe you've given him reason.

730
01:03:12,254 --> 01:03:14,449
What reason could I give?

731
01:03:16,014 --> 01:03:18,005
What reason did you give me?

732
01:03:23,454 --> 01:03:24,284
None.

733
01:03:34,294 --> 01:03:36,649
- Are you on a new book?
- Of course.

734
01:03:37,174 --> 01:03:40,211
It's not about us?
The one you threatened to write?

735
01:03:40,454 --> 01:03:41,967
A book takes a year to write.

736
01:03:42,214 --> 01:03:44,603
It's too hard work for revenge.

737
01:03:44,974 --> 01:03:46,726
If you knew how little
you had to revenge.

738
01:03:46,934 --> 01:03:49,402
No, I'm joking.
We had a good time together.

739
01:03:49,854 --> 01:03:54,405
We're adults, and we knew
it had to end sometime.

740
01:03:54,614 --> 01:03:57,811
And now we can lunch
and talk about Henry.

741
01:04:02,454 --> 01:04:05,207
In the old days,
he would have followed.

742
01:04:05,574 --> 01:04:07,246
We would have made up...

743
01:04:07,494 --> 01:04:09,007
or made love.

744
01:04:26,694 --> 01:04:31,484
I said to God, as I might have
said to my father:

745
01:04:31,694 --> 01:04:34,572
"Dear God, I'm tired.

746
01:04:35,094 --> 01:04:37,813
I'm tired of being without him.

747
01:04:38,654 --> 01:04:41,612
And it's all because of you."

748
01:04:43,294 --> 01:04:47,207
Dr. Gilbert's appointment.
I'd almost forgotten.

749
01:04:47,854 --> 01:04:49,810
He asked me how I felt.

750
01:04:50,774 --> 01:04:53,004
I said I felt nothing.

751
01:04:53,494 --> 01:04:56,406
There was a stone where
my heart should be.

752
01:04:58,574 --> 01:05:00,804
I need help, father.

753
01:05:02,414 --> 01:05:04,052
God granted us free will.

754
01:05:04,294 --> 01:05:07,047
Good. So it's settled.
I'm leaving my husband.

755
01:05:07,294 --> 01:05:08,090
You can't.

756
01:05:08,294 --> 01:05:11,286
Why can't I?
I'm a whore and a liar.

757
01:05:11,694 --> 01:05:14,003
I'm asking Henry for a divorce.

758
01:05:19,694 --> 01:05:22,208
You can't, because you're good.

759
01:05:23,614 --> 01:05:25,809
Better than any person I know.

760
01:05:26,414 --> 01:05:30,089
You're wrong, father.
And you don't know me.

761
01:05:32,054 --> 01:05:34,932
I found a small boy
sleeping on the steps...

762
01:05:35,134 --> 01:05:37,773
with a birthmark
covering his face...

763
01:05:38,054 --> 01:05:41,171
and wondered what kind of God
would give a child that.

764
01:05:41,374 --> 01:05:42,329
Are you lost?

765
01:05:43,374 --> 01:05:45,842
It's all right. It's all right.

766
01:05:46,574 --> 01:05:48,166
Where do you live then?

767
01:05:50,374 --> 01:05:52,285
- You'll be all right now?
- Yes, ma'am.

768
01:05:52,814 --> 01:05:57,012
I kissed his cheek and wished
I could wash it away.

769
01:05:57,494 --> 01:06:02,010
And suddenly, I felt happy again.
I could free myself of this.

770
01:06:03,094 --> 01:06:04,413
I...

771
01:06:05,014 --> 01:06:06,891
am leaving you.

772
01:06:08,494 --> 01:06:10,007
For the last...

773
01:06:10,254 --> 01:06:12,688
five years...

774
01:06:13,454 --> 01:06:17,413
I have been in love...

775
01:06:18,294 --> 01:06:20,410
with Maurice.

776
01:06:20,654 --> 01:06:22,007
I love you.

777
01:06:23,414 --> 01:06:24,813
Know that.

778
01:06:30,294 --> 01:06:31,807
Why now, Henry?

779
01:06:32,894 --> 01:06:34,646
Why do you say that now?

780
01:06:37,774 --> 01:06:39,730
I had a drink with Bendrix.

781
01:06:46,014 --> 01:06:47,811
A horrible drink.

782
01:06:50,094 --> 01:06:52,210
I can't do without you.

783
01:06:53,214 --> 01:06:55,364
"Oh, yes, you can," I thought.

784
01:06:55,574 --> 01:06:59,249
"You changed your newspaper once,
and you soon got used to it."

785
01:06:59,454 --> 01:07:01,331
What's wrong, Henry?

786
01:07:02,094 --> 01:07:04,608
Did Bendrix upset you in some way?

787
01:07:07,294 --> 01:07:09,967
I know I haven't been much
of a husband to you.

788
01:07:10,614 --> 01:07:12,411
We are good friends.

789
01:07:13,454 --> 01:07:15,809
You can do without a friend.

790
01:07:17,414 --> 01:07:19,211
Don't leave me, Sarah.

791
01:07:21,694 --> 01:07:24,003
Stick it out a few more years.

792
01:07:25,214 --> 01:07:26,613
I'll try.

793
01:07:27,054 --> 01:07:28,612
I promise.

794
01:07:33,374 --> 01:07:36,252
Is this coincidence, I wondered?

795
01:07:36,494 --> 01:07:39,008
Or the way life happens?

796
01:07:39,374 --> 01:07:43,162
And if this is life,
am I stuck with it?

797
01:07:44,174 --> 01:07:48,213
But whatever it is,
I can't fight it anymore.

798
01:07:48,974 --> 01:07:52,603
It has won and we have lost.

799
01:08:10,614 --> 01:08:12,411
She's not here.

800
01:08:12,614 --> 01:08:15,412
I know your voice, Sarah.
Talk to me.

801
01:09:02,774 --> 01:09:03,809
Stop here.

802
01:09:05,814 --> 01:09:08,123
- Thank you.
- Thank you very much, guv.

803
01:09:19,094 --> 01:09:20,413
One, please.

804
01:10:14,094 --> 01:10:15,812
How did you get it?

805
01:10:20,454 --> 01:10:23,207
You had a drinks party last week.

806
01:10:24,214 --> 01:10:26,648
- Yes. That small man.
- Yes.

807
01:10:28,054 --> 01:10:29,806
He is my snoop.

808
01:10:31,054 --> 01:10:32,612
Oh, Maurice...

809
01:10:33,054 --> 01:10:35,010
how ridiculous.

810
01:10:36,014 --> 01:10:38,209
It's no more ridiculous than you.

811
01:10:39,414 --> 01:10:40,893
Why didn't you tell me?

812
01:10:41,214 --> 01:10:45,412
I tried. Each time I tried,
something would happen.

813
01:10:46,094 --> 01:10:47,413
That's mumbo-jumbo, Sarah.

814
01:10:47,614 --> 01:10:50,367
No. It doesn't work like that.

815
01:10:50,574 --> 01:10:51,370
Accidents.

816
01:10:52,574 --> 01:10:56,283
Little things.
God is in the details, Maurice.

817
01:10:56,494 --> 01:10:57,813
You can't believe that.

818
01:10:58,374 --> 01:11:00,410
Do you believe in things
you can't see?

819
01:11:03,174 --> 01:11:04,573
- You mean Him?
- I mean you.

820
01:11:07,094 --> 01:11:11,406
You see, I never stopped loving you.
Even though I couldn't see you.

821
01:11:13,974 --> 01:11:16,852
My mother baptized me a Catholic.

822
01:11:17,094 --> 01:11:20,211
My father was Jewish,
so we never practiced.

823
01:11:20,614 --> 01:11:23,412
But she always said
she hoped it would "take".

824
01:11:24,054 --> 01:11:25,772
Like a vaccination.

825
01:11:27,774 --> 01:11:31,403
I've only made two promises
in my life.

826
01:11:32,054 --> 01:11:36,969
One was to marry Henry,
the other to stop seeing you.

827
01:11:39,014 --> 01:11:41,403
And I'm too weak to keep either.

828
01:11:44,814 --> 01:11:46,884
I know you don't believe in Him...

829
01:11:49,214 --> 01:11:51,011
but try to.

830
01:11:51,454 --> 01:11:53,206
Talk to Him.

831
01:11:54,214 --> 01:11:55,203
I can't.

832
01:11:55,454 --> 01:11:57,365
Tell Him I'm sorry.

833
01:11:57,614 --> 01:12:01,209
I'm too human. Too weak.

834
01:12:02,414 --> 01:12:06,009
Tell Him I can't keep my promises.

835
01:12:07,174 --> 01:12:09,813
I'm tired of being without you.

836
01:12:12,894 --> 01:12:15,613
- Let's get you home.
- I don't want to go home.

837
01:12:17,654 --> 01:12:19,007
I know.

838
01:13:01,974 --> 01:13:04,408
So have we broken the spell?

839
01:13:08,174 --> 01:13:09,971
The world didn't end, did it?

840
01:13:10,174 --> 01:13:14,292
It did, in a way.
But then, it always did.

841
01:13:16,494 --> 01:13:18,450
Can I sleep now, Maurice?

842
01:13:19,374 --> 01:13:21,285
Please let me sleep.

843
01:13:47,934 --> 01:13:49,686
- It's Henry.
- Don't answer it.

844
01:13:49,934 --> 01:13:52,494
Why not? We'll have to
tell him sometime.

845
01:13:52,894 --> 01:13:55,124
- Come away with me.
- Where?

846
01:13:55,334 --> 01:13:57,404
Anywhere. Brighton.

847
01:13:58,134 --> 01:14:01,285
I want a few days peace before
the arguments begin.

848
01:14:01,574 --> 01:14:02,723
Well, Henry never argues.

849
01:14:02,974 --> 01:14:04,453
I wasn't talking about Henry.

850
01:14:10,134 --> 01:14:12,284
Pain is easy to write.

851
01:14:13,254 --> 01:14:16,291
In pain, we're all drably individual.

852
01:14:17,494 --> 01:14:20,088
But what can one write
about happiness?

853
01:14:43,574 --> 01:14:45,690
It doesn't suit you. And it's mine.

854
01:14:45,894 --> 01:14:47,373
You want it? There's a price.

855
01:14:47,574 --> 01:14:48,893
How much?

856
01:14:53,494 --> 01:14:55,086
Can I pay again?

857
01:14:58,094 --> 01:14:59,322
I want children, you know.

858
01:14:59,574 --> 01:15:01,087
How many?

859
01:15:01,374 --> 01:15:02,409
We'll start with one.

860
01:15:02,654 --> 01:15:03,882
Only one?

861
01:15:04,574 --> 01:15:06,292
You want to start with two?

862
01:15:07,374 --> 01:15:08,887
Is that a promise?

863
01:15:09,494 --> 01:15:10,688
Yes.

864
01:15:18,734 --> 01:15:20,452
Let's get you back to the hotel.

865
01:15:40,174 --> 01:15:42,404
- It's a bit of a mess, isn't it?
- You're right.

866
01:15:46,574 --> 01:15:48,530
Business going well?

867
01:15:48,974 --> 01:15:52,683
Still on the job, Parkis?
Don't worry. Come with me.

868
01:15:53,134 --> 01:15:54,044
Come.

869
01:15:54,254 --> 01:15:55,926
So where's your boy this time?

870
01:15:56,174 --> 01:15:57,687
I left him at home, sir.

871
01:15:57,974 --> 01:16:01,171
Hardly a wise move. He has
the sense not to get noticed.

872
01:16:01,374 --> 01:16:04,446
You think so? Perhaps I wasn't
cut out for this job.

873
01:16:05,054 --> 01:16:08,012
Tell your employer
the circumstances are unique.

874
01:16:08,254 --> 01:16:11,849
What was your phrase?
The party in question is a writer.

875
01:16:12,094 --> 01:16:13,288
They notice everything.

876
01:16:13,494 --> 01:16:15,485
They certainly seem to, sir.

877
01:16:17,094 --> 01:16:20,484
- So who's hired you this time?
- I'm not at liberty to say, sir.

878
01:16:20,694 --> 01:16:22,889
Let me guess. The jealous husband.

879
01:16:25,734 --> 01:16:27,884
I never expected to be recalled
to this case.

880
01:16:28,094 --> 01:16:29,686
Yours is a secure profession.

881
01:16:29,894 --> 01:16:33,443
As long as fools like us love,
your employment never ends.

882
01:16:33,774 --> 01:16:35,173
You could put it like that.

883
01:16:35,454 --> 01:16:38,093
And love never ends, does it?

884
01:16:39,134 --> 01:16:40,283
It seems not, sir.

885
01:16:40,494 --> 01:16:44,885
So what do you need? Photographs
of us in flagrante delicto?

886
01:16:45,094 --> 01:16:48,006
Copies of hotel bills?
Evidence of soiled sheets?

887
01:16:48,254 --> 01:16:49,323
We'd be happy to oblige.

888
01:16:49,574 --> 01:16:53,726
No. My brief is to follow you.
Inform him as to your whereabouts.

889
01:16:53,934 --> 01:16:55,572
Which, of course, you'll do.

890
01:16:55,774 --> 01:16:58,732
I'm obliged to under the terms
of my employment, posthaste.

891
01:16:58,934 --> 01:17:03,086
Won't you need supplementary evidence?
The divorce courts will demand it.

892
01:17:04,494 --> 01:17:07,964
They generally do, sir,
if it come to that.

893
01:17:09,334 --> 01:17:10,926
Exhibit A.

894
01:17:12,094 --> 01:17:15,370
Receipt for two sandwiches bought
on the train to Brighton.

895
01:17:15,574 --> 01:17:18,532
Mutual sandwiches are evidence
of intimacy, aren't they?

896
01:17:18,774 --> 01:17:20,048
They could be so construed.

897
01:17:20,294 --> 01:17:23,411
Exhibit B.
Two tickets for a Big Dipper.

898
01:17:23,614 --> 01:17:24,967
You seem to be doing my job.

899
01:17:25,174 --> 01:17:29,213
Yes, but we haven't quite gotten there.
What would clinch it for us, Parkis?

900
01:17:29,574 --> 01:17:32,372
What would make divorce a certainty?

901
01:17:37,494 --> 01:17:42,170
Generally, sir, some kind
of photographic evidence of...

902
01:17:44,174 --> 01:17:45,892
Of intimacy.

903
01:17:48,734 --> 01:17:52,568
Would be most useful, sir,
if it came to such a pass.

904
01:17:52,814 --> 01:17:54,486
It will, Parkis.

905
01:17:55,294 --> 01:17:57,091
It certainly will.

906
01:18:26,534 --> 01:18:28,047
Here, here, drink this.

907
01:18:35,174 --> 01:18:36,846
I dreamt we had a child.

908
01:18:37,054 --> 01:18:38,282
We will.

909
01:18:39,134 --> 01:18:43,127
We were on the bed together.
The room filled up with water.

910
01:18:43,374 --> 01:18:44,887
There was a child between us.

911
01:18:45,174 --> 01:18:46,493
Why water?

912
01:18:47,374 --> 01:18:49,490
The sea had come in the window.

913
01:19:06,534 --> 01:19:09,685
So you'll marry me?

914
01:19:12,174 --> 01:19:13,892
That's a promise.

915
01:19:43,374 --> 01:19:47,128
The prince regent began building it
for his mistress, Mrs. Fitzherbert.

916
01:19:47,334 --> 01:19:48,892
Beautiful but flawed.

917
01:19:49,134 --> 01:19:50,362
How was she flawed?

918
01:19:50,574 --> 01:19:51,927
She was Catholic.

919
01:19:52,134 --> 01:19:53,886
Impossible, of course.

920
01:19:54,374 --> 01:19:55,727
So he loved her.

921
01:19:55,934 --> 01:20:00,371
Yes, but he married Princess Caroline
of Brunswick, who was Protestant...

922
01:20:01,254 --> 01:20:02,482
but huge.

923
01:20:02,694 --> 01:20:05,572
And he built this huge
folly to impossibility.

924
01:20:06,694 --> 01:20:09,254
- Not now, Henry.
- Forgive me, Sarah. I had to.

925
01:20:09,774 --> 01:20:13,005
- Oh, God, please. Henry, not now.
- You had to what, Henry?

926
01:20:14,614 --> 01:20:15,410
Talk.

927
01:20:15,654 --> 01:20:18,122
Go back home.
You can't hold on to her forever.

928
01:20:18,374 --> 01:20:19,170
I know that.

929
01:20:19,374 --> 01:20:23,253
It hardly suits you, Henry,
the role of jealous husband.

930
01:20:23,494 --> 01:20:25,371
I don't mean to make a scene.

931
01:20:25,574 --> 01:20:27,485
Henry, go home.

932
01:20:28,574 --> 01:20:30,804
I'm not jealous, Bendrix.

933
01:20:31,894 --> 01:20:33,612
What was it you said?

934
01:20:33,814 --> 01:20:38,012
Lovers are jealous.
Husbands are ridiculous.

935
01:20:39,974 --> 01:20:41,771
I was never her lover.

936
01:20:42,454 --> 01:20:44,285
Not much of a husband either,
I'm afraid.

937
01:20:44,494 --> 01:20:46,405
But you hired our detective.

938
01:20:46,654 --> 01:20:48,724
I had to find out where she was.

939
01:20:48,934 --> 01:20:52,449
So you know.
She wants a divorce.

940
01:20:53,294 --> 01:20:55,649
That won't be possible, old man.

941
01:20:56,654 --> 01:20:58,007
You'll contest it?

942
01:20:58,214 --> 01:21:01,172
No. But it would take
at least three months.

943
01:21:01,374 --> 01:21:05,208
What's three months, Henry,
out of a lifetime?

944
01:21:06,054 --> 01:21:07,089
Half.

945
01:21:08,374 --> 01:21:09,887
Half of what?

946
01:21:10,854 --> 01:21:13,084
Of a lifetime, I'm afraid.

947
01:21:14,974 --> 01:21:17,090
Sarah's dying, Bendrix.

948
01:21:18,054 --> 01:21:20,807
Her doctor called the night
she didn't come back...

949
01:21:21,894 --> 01:21:24,044
...with the result of some tests.

950
01:21:25,854 --> 01:21:27,890
I knocked on your door.

951
01:21:29,454 --> 01:21:31,888
I imagined you were both there.

952
01:21:34,974 --> 01:21:37,442
How oddly we behave at such moments.

953
01:21:53,694 --> 01:21:55,605
You shouldn't get wet, darling.

954
01:21:55,814 --> 01:21:58,248
- Don't you like the rain?
- Yes, dear, but...

955
01:21:58,454 --> 01:22:02,413
You've heard news, Henry.
Is it good?

956
01:22:03,734 --> 01:22:05,008
No, dear.

957
01:22:06,454 --> 01:22:10,891
You see, Maurice, never make
a promise. You may have to keep it.

958
01:22:18,334 --> 01:22:21,531
You should never have been
jealous of me, Bendrix.

959
01:22:26,934 --> 01:22:31,849
I did Sarah a great disservice when
I married her. I realize that now.

960
01:22:33,574 --> 01:22:36,088
I'm not the sort that makes a lover.

961
01:22:38,174 --> 01:22:40,529
She wanted someone like you.

962
01:22:41,454 --> 01:22:43,729
I'm not sure it's as simple as that.

963
01:22:47,774 --> 01:22:49,890
If you don't mind me asking...

964
01:22:51,334 --> 01:22:54,485
I'd like you there
when the time comes.

965
01:22:54,734 --> 01:22:55,849
It may not come, Henry.

966
01:22:58,054 --> 01:23:00,807
You, of all people, don't believe
in miracles, Bendrix.

967
01:23:01,094 --> 01:23:03,688
No, but Sarah does.

968
01:23:06,774 --> 01:23:11,006
You see, I'd always believed that
I'd be the one to die first...

969
01:23:12,134 --> 01:23:14,648
and that Sarah would
know what to do.

970
01:23:18,054 --> 01:23:20,693
Are you at a loss, Henry?

971
01:23:23,934 --> 01:23:26,084
I am quite.

972
01:23:28,694 --> 01:23:32,403
And it would save you a bit
if you moved in with us.

973
01:23:32,734 --> 01:23:37,091
Sarah always said your books weren't
as successful as they should have been.

974
01:23:40,574 --> 01:23:42,326
You could be there...

975
01:23:42,574 --> 01:23:45,930
working in the daytime
while I'm at the ministry.

976
01:23:46,174 --> 01:23:47,892
And at night...

977
01:23:49,054 --> 01:23:50,692
we could both...

978
01:23:57,134 --> 01:24:00,092
And so I moved to the north side
of the common...

979
01:24:00,774 --> 01:24:04,687
and, oddly enough,
I felt instantly at home.

980
01:24:13,894 --> 01:24:15,293
Can I help you, father?

981
01:24:17,254 --> 01:24:19,768
- I've come about Mrs. Mlles.
- She's indisposed.

982
01:24:20,014 --> 01:24:22,733
You mean she's ill.
Don't you?

983
01:24:23,094 --> 01:24:25,085
Yes, I suppose I do.

984
01:24:27,694 --> 01:24:30,891
She's been to see me several times, and
I know she'd like to see me before...

985
01:24:31,094 --> 01:24:33,972
She's left word with me,
she's not to be disturbed.

986
01:24:34,174 --> 01:24:36,051
Is her husband here?

987
01:24:37,454 --> 01:24:38,250
No.

988
01:24:43,854 --> 01:24:45,082
She told me about you.

989
01:24:45,494 --> 01:24:46,927
I know she did.

990
01:24:48,254 --> 01:24:49,892
I'm the lover, father.

991
01:25:03,774 --> 01:25:05,287
Who was that?

992
01:25:12,654 --> 01:25:14,292
The postman.

993
01:25:17,174 --> 01:25:19,085
What did he bring?

994
01:25:21,174 --> 01:25:23,085
He had the wrong address.

995
01:25:27,534 --> 01:25:29,889
How odd for a postman.

996
01:25:40,294 --> 01:25:42,888
You know what happened that day?

997
01:25:45,094 --> 01:25:48,973
You thought I was dead and I wasn't.

998
01:25:51,734 --> 01:25:53,372
No, darling.

999
01:25:54,934 --> 01:25:57,494
Something happened in that room.

1000
01:25:59,134 --> 01:26:02,809
There were the same walls around me...

1001
01:26:03,014 --> 01:26:06,689
the same sunlight coming in
through the window.

1002
01:26:08,374 --> 01:26:11,684
But nothing would ever
be the same again.

1003
01:26:13,174 --> 01:26:15,688
You can't believe this, Sarah.

1004
01:26:17,974 --> 01:26:19,692
But it's true.

1005
01:26:21,534 --> 01:26:24,685
I never loved anyone as I loved you.

1006
01:26:26,054 --> 01:26:29,763
Then when you came through that door
with blood on your face...

1007
01:26:32,134 --> 01:26:35,092
another kind of love came with you.

1008
01:26:36,334 --> 01:26:40,691
And I caught belief like a disease.

1009
01:26:41,534 --> 01:26:43,923
I fell into belief like I'd...

1010
01:26:45,254 --> 01:26:47,484
fallen in love.

1011
01:26:48,574 --> 01:26:50,883
And I tried to fight it...

1012
01:26:53,494 --> 01:26:56,486
but I haven't any fight left.

1013
01:27:17,094 --> 01:27:19,892
It wasn't the postman, was it?

1014
01:27:21,294 --> 01:27:23,489
No, it wasn't.

1015
01:27:25,054 --> 01:27:27,932
Dear Maurice, you can't
go on fighting.

1016
01:27:28,134 --> 01:27:30,694
It's only love, after all.

1017
01:28:05,174 --> 01:28:08,086
So you're taking her.

1018
01:28:08,294 --> 01:28:10,091
But you haven't got me yet.

1019
01:28:10,774 --> 01:28:13,686
I don't want your peace
and your love.

1020
01:28:14,974 --> 01:28:17,488
I wanted Sarah for a lifetime...

1021
01:28:18,054 --> 01:28:20,488
and you're taking her from me.

1022
01:28:21,374 --> 01:28:24,411
So I hate you, God.

1023
01:28:24,894 --> 01:28:28,091
I hate you as though you existed.

1024
01:28:45,494 --> 01:28:48,531
You have to help me, Bendrix.
I can't.

1025
01:28:48,734 --> 01:28:50,247
I will.

1026
01:28:50,454 --> 01:28:53,093
I can't live in a world,
where she's gone.

1027
01:28:56,774 --> 01:28:58,685
I'll help you.

1028
01:29:14,334 --> 01:29:17,849
I would have taken care of all
the arrangements if I'd known.

1029
01:29:18,054 --> 01:29:20,090
Surely you disapprove of cremation?

1030
01:29:20,294 --> 01:29:21,966
I would've arranged a Catholic burial.

1031
01:29:22,254 --> 01:29:24,245
She wasn't a Catholic,
was she, Henry?

1032
01:29:24,534 --> 01:29:26,764
We recognize the baptism of desire.

1033
01:29:28,934 --> 01:29:30,925
She said things that seemed
like prayers.

1034
01:29:31,174 --> 01:29:34,325
We've made the arrangements.
We can't alter things now.

1035
01:29:34,534 --> 01:29:36,764
You don't want talk.
The notice in the Times.

1036
01:29:36,974 --> 01:29:38,043
No. Oh, no.

1037
01:29:39,174 --> 01:29:42,246
If you'd come a little sooner,
father. Please don't think...

1038
01:29:42,494 --> 01:29:44,212
I think nothing bad of you.

1039
01:29:44,494 --> 01:29:45,449
Perhaps me?

1040
01:29:45,654 --> 01:29:49,169
Don't worry, Mr. Bendrix. Nothing
you can do will affect her now.

1041
01:29:53,094 --> 01:29:54,129
She was a good woman.

1042
01:29:54,374 --> 01:29:57,127
She wasn't. She could put
the blinkers on any man.

1043
01:29:57,374 --> 01:30:00,650
She deceived you, her husband and me.
She was a consummate liar.

1044
01:30:00,854 --> 01:30:02,572
- You've no right.
- Let him rave.

1045
01:30:02,774 --> 01:30:05,811
Don't give me your pity!
Keep it for your confessional!

1046
01:30:06,054 --> 01:30:07,612
You can find me when you want me.

1047
01:30:07,854 --> 01:30:09,412
I don't want you.
I'm no Sarah.

1048
01:30:09,614 --> 01:30:10,967
- Sorry, father.
- No need to be.

1049
01:30:12,174 --> 01:30:15,086
You see, I know when a man is in pain.

1050
01:30:16,454 --> 01:30:19,332
I'm not in pain, father.
I'm in hate.

1051
01:30:19,574 --> 01:30:22,566
I hate Sarah because she was a tart
to your mumbo-jumbo.

1052
01:30:22,774 --> 01:30:24,810
I hate Henry because she stuck to him.

1053
01:30:25,014 --> 01:30:26,686
And I hate you
and your imaginary God...

1054
01:30:26,894 --> 01:30:29,283
...because you took her away
from all of us.

1055
01:30:32,174 --> 01:30:33,607
You are a good hater.

1056
01:30:33,854 --> 01:30:35,685
To hell with all of you!

1057
01:31:13,094 --> 01:31:14,686
I'm sorry, Henry.

1058
01:31:21,774 --> 01:31:23,890
The thing is, Bendrix...

1059
01:31:25,654 --> 01:31:27,485
I always knew.

1060
01:31:29,774 --> 01:31:31,890
I knew she was with someone.

1061
01:31:33,854 --> 01:31:36,084
But I never thought you.

1062
01:31:39,374 --> 01:31:41,285
But the odd thing is...

1063
01:31:42,894 --> 01:31:44,885
I'm glad it was.

1064
01:32:03,774 --> 01:32:08,689
It's a sad pleasure to see you here.
Bygones are always bygones.

1065
01:32:09,174 --> 01:32:12,132
Do you always follow your people
as far as this?

1066
01:32:13,334 --> 01:32:15,484
She was a very fine lady, sir.

1067
01:32:15,974 --> 01:32:18,772
At the cocktail party, she handed
me a glass of sherry.

1068
01:32:18,974 --> 01:32:21,090
Was it South African sherry?

1069
01:32:21,334 --> 01:32:22,813
I wouldn't know, sir.

1070
01:32:23,294 --> 01:32:25,091
There weren't many like her.

1071
01:32:25,774 --> 01:32:28,334
My boy, now, he's always
speaking of her.

1072
01:32:28,534 --> 01:32:30,570
How is your boy, Parkis?

1073
01:32:31,414 --> 01:32:35,168
He's exceptionally well, sir,
though he's a bit upset today.

1074
01:32:35,814 --> 01:32:37,850
He imagined she'd be buried
a Catholic.

1075
01:32:38,054 --> 01:32:40,010
And why would he think that?

1076
01:32:40,334 --> 01:32:42,450
Young boys, sir, they get these ideas.

1077
01:32:43,134 --> 01:32:46,126
Though I have to admit, even
I can't explain it.

1078
01:32:46,374 --> 01:32:48,092
Explain what?

1079
01:32:49,134 --> 01:32:53,491
On the day of her assignation,
she walked him to a tube.

1080
01:32:53,894 --> 01:32:57,489
She thought he was lost, gave him
a coin and kissed him on his cheek...

1081
01:32:57,974 --> 01:32:59,566
on his afflicted cheek, sir.

1082
01:33:00,054 --> 01:33:03,888
And over the weeks that followed,
his affliction gradually went away.

1083
01:33:04,334 --> 01:33:07,485
I tried to keep him rational,
but he swears it was because of her.

1084
01:33:09,734 --> 01:33:11,964
Say hello to Mr. Bendrix, Lance.

1085
01:33:29,774 --> 01:33:31,287
Hello, sir.

1086
01:33:42,974 --> 01:33:46,683
I wrote at the start that this
was a diary of hate.

1087
01:33:46,894 --> 01:33:49,692
I hated you as though you existed.

1088
01:33:49,974 --> 01:33:51,965
Now I am tired of hating.

1089
01:33:52,854 --> 01:33:54,731
But you're still there.

1090
01:33:55,254 --> 01:33:58,291
So your cunning is infinite.

1091
01:33:58,894 --> 01:34:02,284
You used my hate to win
my acknowledgment.

1092
01:34:03,174 --> 01:34:05,688
And I've only one prayer left.

1093
01:34:06,734 --> 01:34:09,885
Dear God, forget about me.

1094
01:34:10,534 --> 01:34:13,810
Look after her and Henry.
