23.976

2
00:00:03,045 --> 00:00:05,464
"4.5 inches by 4.0 inches."

3
00:00:05,547 --> 00:00:08,509
And they got it in centimeters or whatever.

4
00:00:12,513 --> 00:00:15,182
It's the same shit on the back. All right?

5
00:00:16,475 --> 00:00:19,102
- Good night.
- Good night, Larry.

6
00:00:22,898 --> 00:00:24,983
- Yeah.
- Thank you very much.

7
00:00:49,341 --> 00:00:51,385
What are your friends like?

8
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:56,598
- I don't really have friends.
- Who do you hang out with?

9
00:00:58,725 --> 00:00:59,852
Nobody.

10
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:05,899
Why do I think you're not exaggerating?

11
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:10,362
I just keep to myself.

12
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:13,365
I go about my business, you know.
Do my work.

13
00:01:14,825 --> 00:01:18,787
A charming, loveable guy like yourself?
You should get out more.

14
00:01:18,954 --> 00:01:22,541
I'm sure there's a ton of straight women
who you could make very happy.

15
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:28,630
Louis wants us to cut the kid's thumb off.

16
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:21,934
I'd like to give shouts to all my homies.

17
00:02:22,434 --> 00:02:24,853
Mrs. Friedman. Lily.

18
00:02:24,937 --> 00:02:27,898
Mr. Mossman
and the man he plays cards with.

19
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:29,775
Forgot his name.

20
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:32,945
And all my peeps at Wilshire Adult Care.

21
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:36,573
Everybody in the cafeteria. Big ups!

22
00:02:37,616 --> 00:02:40,994
What's up to my man Larry. And Ricki.

23
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:43,080
Yo, yo, yo. Peace, G.

24
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:46,124
And the rec room.

25
00:02:50,963 --> 00:02:52,923
I got neighbors, you know.

26
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:56,260
{y:i}Dígame sabrosa.

27
00:02:58,345 --> 00:03:00,639
- What's that?
- It's "español".

28
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:02,891
What does it mean?

29
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:05,477
I don't know.

30
00:03:09,481 --> 00:03:10,774
See that?

31
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,945
Don't be a playa hater, G.

32
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:23,620
- Yeah?
- Who the fuck are you?

33
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:25,998
Who the fuck are you?

34
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:30,586
Excuse me.

35
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:33,672
What a shithole!

36
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:37,301
- Lady, I think you're in the wrong place.
- You are in the wrong place.

37
00:03:37,426 --> 00:03:40,888
All right? You're in the wrong place.
You have no idea.

38
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:44,057
And who the fuck are you?

39
00:03:44,266 --> 00:03:46,685
- You're the fuck are you.
- What?

40
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:51,356
What are you doing here?

41
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:54,651
- I'm stalking you.
- Wait, you know her?

42
00:03:54,693 --> 00:03:57,404
First of all,
do not say my name in this room. All right?

43
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:59,281
Second of all, you're out of line.

44
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:02,659
This is a professional situation
and you have no right to intrude.

45
00:04:02,701 --> 00:04:06,205
What kind of professional situation?
I can't believe this.

46
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:08,248
A fucking man?

47
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:11,251
Okay. I really thought
this was all about Sharon.

48
00:04:11,335 --> 00:04:14,213
- Are you telling people where we are?
- Mind your own business.

49
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:15,964
- Shut the fuck up.
- Blow me.

50
00:04:16,048 --> 00:04:17,549
Listen, both of you shut up.

51
00:04:17,883 --> 00:04:21,470
Look, I haven't told anybody where we are.
And, Robin...

52
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:24,598
this is a professional situation.

53
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:28,185
Our problems
have nothing to do with Sharon...

54
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:30,229
and they have nothing to do with him.

55
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:32,856
- I want you to leave right now! Please.
- No!

56
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,025
I'm not leaving, he's leaving.

57
00:04:35,484 --> 00:04:37,611
What? Who the fuck do you think you are?

58
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:40,572
- I fucking live here. I'm not going anywhere.
- Yeah?

59
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:43,408
Neither am I. Going to be all there is to that.

60
00:04:43,492 --> 00:04:45,744
- Why are you doing this?
- What if I throw you out?

61
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:49,206
What if I roundhouse you upside
your fat head and collapse your skull.

62
00:04:49,248 --> 00:04:53,085
- I don't know. Give it a shot.
- Don't. She knows how to do that stuff.

63
00:04:53,168 --> 00:04:55,087
- Don't be macho.
- I don't give a fuck.

64
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:58,215
This isn't lesbian talk-circle time.
We got something to do.

65
00:04:58,257 --> 00:05:01,927
- You're getting the fuck out. Got it?
- I mean, this? You need this?

66
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:06,056
You need a little freedom or something?
You want to dabble? We can all fuck.

67
00:05:06,098 --> 00:05:08,433
We can all have sex together, that's fine.

68
00:05:09,101 --> 00:05:10,269
What do you say, Hot Rocks?

69
00:05:10,352 --> 00:05:12,312
- Would you like it?
- You're out of your mind.

70
00:05:12,396 --> 00:05:15,607
- You know you want it.
- Our situation has nothing to do with him.

71
00:05:16,567 --> 00:05:17,901
It's over.

72
00:05:19,278 --> 00:05:22,906
- It's not him. It's us, honey.
- Right, it's not you, it's her. Get the...

73
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:25,617
Just shut up for one second! God! Fuck!

74
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:27,828
This has nothing to do with him.

75
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,668
- It's just, we're over.
- No, we're not over.

76
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:38,547
We'll set up together, the three of us,
till you get this out of your system.

77
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:42,551
- Baby, you're not hearing me.
- I'm fucking hearing you. Okay?

78
00:05:44,803 --> 00:05:45,929
God damn it!

79
00:05:46,597 --> 00:05:50,184
See, I'm going to kill myself right now
and you care...

80
00:05:50,976 --> 00:05:53,937
- That's a nice girl.
- Shut the fuck up, all right!

81
00:05:56,565 --> 00:05:58,609
- What the fuck is that?
- What did you...

82
00:05:58,692 --> 00:05:59,902
No.

83
00:06:01,987 --> 00:06:04,072
- What did you do?
- Is this hot enough for you?

84
00:06:04,156 --> 00:06:05,532
- Get away.
- You want some?

85
00:06:05,616 --> 00:06:06,992
Get away. What's wrong with you?

86
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:08,702
- Oh, my God.
- What the fuck is this?

87
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:10,495
Lady, you need some Band-Aids.

88
00:06:15,501 --> 00:06:18,045
This must be Mental-fucking-lllness Week.

89
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:33,685
That woman is fucking beautiful.

90
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:36,522
Yes.

91
00:06:37,356 --> 00:06:39,525
She's like the ones at the Baywatch.

92
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:44,404
They make my penis sneeze.

93
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:51,954
You got a good sense of humor,
you know that?

94
00:06:52,538 --> 00:06:53,664
God bless you.

95
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:58,877
- Thank you.
- No, not you, stupid.

96
00:06:58,961 --> 00:07:01,088
When my penis sneezes,
I say, "God bless you.

97
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:03,006
"God bless you, penis."

98
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:23,402
She's going to be okay.

99
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:25,737
What a relief.

100
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:32,119
Brian, would you excuse us?
I want to talk to Larry for a minute. Okay?

101
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:34,204
- You'll be all right in the car?
- Yeah.

102
00:07:34,246 --> 00:07:35,622
Okay, good.

103
00:07:47,843 --> 00:07:48,927
I just...

104
00:07:49,887 --> 00:07:52,389
I got to tell you,
I'm not up for this thumb deal.

105
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,266
I say we don't do it.

106
00:08:00,606 --> 00:08:02,274
You trying to test me?

107
00:08:02,441 --> 00:08:05,569
Is that it? You wanna see
if I'm gonna do what I'm supposed to do?

108
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:06,653
No.

109
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:11,408
So, what are you,
a contractor with a conscience?

110
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,621
Look, I've done some bad things...

111
00:08:15,787 --> 00:08:19,166
but I didn't sign on to this
to be a brutal street thug.

112
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:23,045
Because, as far as I'm concerned,
that's not the job I took.

113
00:08:27,382 --> 00:08:28,967
How would you get around it?

114
00:08:30,219 --> 00:08:31,595
I'd work it out.

115
00:08:32,304 --> 00:08:35,265
But first I got to know, are you with me?

116
00:08:46,318 --> 00:08:47,277
Sure.

117
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:49,571
Sure or yes?

118
00:08:49,655 --> 00:08:52,366
- That's the same thing.
- No, it's not the same thing.

119
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:56,537
See, if I were to ask you to move my couch
for me you'd probably say, "Sure."

120
00:08:57,329 --> 00:08:59,915
But if I were to ask you
to look deep into my eyes...

121
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,251
and tell me from the bottom of your heart...

122
00:09:02,334 --> 00:09:06,129
if it would give you great pleasure
if I were to suck your cock for 12 hours...

123
00:09:06,547 --> 00:09:09,466
if I may be presumptuous,
you'd probably say, "Yes."

124
00:09:10,801 --> 00:09:13,512
See, it just implies
a different level of commitment.

125
00:09:16,682 --> 00:09:18,267
Ask me the question again.

126
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:21,353
Okay. Are you with me?

127
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,648
Yes.

128
00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:29,987
Yeah? Good.

129
00:09:34,116 --> 00:09:34,366
Isn't this B level?

130
00:09:34,366 --> 00:09:35,367
Isn't this B level?

131
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:37,244
This is D level. You shouldn't be here.

132
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:38,662
I'm looking for B level.

133
00:09:38,704 --> 00:09:42,374
This is a D level and no one is allowed here.
You need to go back to B level.

134
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:45,294
Hold on.
Because you're confusing me, okay?

135
00:09:45,377 --> 00:09:46,503
You're confusing me.

136
00:09:46,545 --> 00:09:49,173
Let's just start from the beginning.
If this isn't B...

137
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:50,883
Oh, my God.

138
00:09:52,217 --> 00:09:54,720
- I am so sorry.
- That's okay.

139
00:09:58,974 --> 00:10:02,019
Just soak that in cold water
and it'll come right out, okay?

140
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:04,563
I promise you. Yes. No, it will.

141
00:10:06,023 --> 00:10:10,027
The thing is, the reason I'm here
is they told me to go around the corner...

142
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:11,695
- Close your eyes.
- What?

143
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:14,865
Close your eyes. Follow me.
Just walk in. Don't look.

144
00:10:15,824 --> 00:10:17,743
Come on. Go. You're fine.

145
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:26,627
- Can I open them?
- No. Stand right here.

146
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:29,713
- It's cold in here.
- Don't look at nothing. All right?

147
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,433
- Can I open them?
- No.

148
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:43,769
Stay turned around.

149
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:46,563
Smells like my grandmother's.

150
00:10:51,109 --> 00:10:53,237
- What was that?
- It's nothing.

151
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:25,394
{y:i}I like big butts and I cannot lie

152
00:11:25,644 --> 00:11:27,521
{y:i}The other brothers can't deny

153
00:11:27,813 --> 00:11:29,982
{y:i}When the girls walk in
{y:i}with an itty-bitty waist

154
00:11:30,065 --> 00:11:34,486
{y:i}And round things in your face
{y:i}You get sprung, wanna pull up tough

155
00:11:34,528 --> 00:11:36,154
{y:i}'Cause you notice that butt was stuffed

156
00:11:36,238 --> 00:11:38,991
{y:i}'Cause I'm long, and I'm strong

157
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:40,701
{y:i}And I'm down to get the friction on

158
00:11:40,784 --> 00:11:42,536
{y:i}So, ladies, yeah

159
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:43,787
{y:i}Ladies, yeah

160
00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:46,373
{y:i}If you wanna roll in my Mercedes
{y:i}Yeah

161
00:11:46,623 --> 00:11:50,794
{y:i}So turn around! Stick it out!
{y:i}Even white boys got to shout

162
00:11:50,836 --> 00:11:52,087
{y:i}Baby got back!

163
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:55,257
{y:i}Baby got back!

164
00:11:58,177 --> 00:12:00,345
That's an old-school song.

165
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,516
You're old-school, too, Larry.

166
00:12:08,145 --> 00:12:11,815
We got an item that we want
to package ourselves and, you know...

167
00:12:11,857 --> 00:12:12,941
- Mail out.
- Okay.

168
00:12:13,025 --> 00:12:15,235
Could we just get an envelope from you?

169
00:12:15,611 --> 00:12:17,070
What size would you like?

170
00:12:17,154 --> 00:12:19,323
- Just the top, right...
- 6 by 9.

171
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:24,745
So all right.

172
00:12:26,121 --> 00:12:27,539
We're done, right?

173
00:12:29,124 --> 00:12:30,209
That's it.

174
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:46,558
Thanks.

175
00:13:03,367 --> 00:13:05,536
Would you like your parcel insured?

176
00:13:08,413 --> 00:13:10,207
No, that's all right.

177
00:13:28,642 --> 00:13:30,394
I'll be right back.

178
00:13:33,063 --> 00:13:34,648
Friend of yours?

179
00:13:35,607 --> 00:13:36,942
Close, personal.

180
00:13:45,909 --> 00:13:49,204
You know something?
You're right. It is sadness.

181
00:13:49,997 --> 00:13:53,542
I'm fucking sad. You got me.
You're a genius.

182
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:58,380
You know why I'm fucking sad?
Because I got this fucking...

183
00:13:59,631 --> 00:14:02,759
beautiful, sexy, gorgeous...

184
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:07,389
heartthrob-o-rama,
fucking smart, amazing bombshell...

185
00:14:07,556 --> 00:14:10,475
17-on-a-fucking-10-scale girl...

186
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:12,728
sleeping in a bed, right next to me.

187
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:15,856
And you know what?

188
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:19,443
She's a stone-cold dyke.

189
00:14:20,068 --> 00:14:22,321
A fucking untouchable...

190
00:14:22,404 --> 00:14:25,449
unhaveable, unattainable brick wall...

191
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:27,576
fucking Dykeasaurus Rexi.

192
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:32,497
So it's sad, okay?
What do you want me to do?

193
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:35,375
I feel fucking sadness about that.

194
00:14:36,293 --> 00:14:38,337
There's nothing I can fucking do.

195
00:14:44,176 --> 00:14:46,678
And not only is she a major babe...

196
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:50,516
but I really like this girl a lot.

197
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:52,601
A lot.

198
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:56,146
She's not like anybody else
I ever knew before...

199
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:58,857
and that's a completely fucking new one
on me.

200
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:04,029
I don't even know her real fucking name.
So there you go.

201
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:07,115
And in case you're interested, my life sucks.

202
00:15:08,534 --> 00:15:11,453
All right? Stick a fork in me, I'm done.

203
00:15:28,637 --> 00:15:32,182
{y:i}Clean the bar all you like.
{y:i}I'm just going to puke on it again.

204
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:34,726
{y:i}- Oh, you got me.
{y:i}- Oh! I got you!

205
00:15:45,112 --> 00:15:47,155
Do you think your fingernails
need trimming?

206
00:15:55,914 --> 00:15:57,416
They're fine.

207
00:16:01,128 --> 00:16:03,505
What? You don't like my fingernails now?

208
00:16:05,841 --> 00:16:10,053
Look, I have no idea if this is true or not,
but I've heard it said...

209
00:16:10,512 --> 00:16:14,892
that those who are balanced
more toward the masculine of either sex...

210
00:16:14,933 --> 00:16:17,060
check their fingernails this way.

211
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:22,274
And those balanced more toward
the feminine check them that way.

212
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:27,070
I had a feeling that even though
you have this tough guy thing going on...

213
00:16:27,154 --> 00:16:30,657
that you are wrestling
with some very strong feminine leanings.

214
00:16:31,283 --> 00:16:32,951
That's fucking bullshit.

215
00:16:33,452 --> 00:16:36,747
I can't see. I'm farsighted.
Nearsighted, whatever it is.

216
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:40,584
So I hold them out here
but I can't see them up close.

217
00:16:41,585 --> 00:16:44,963
To find out how somebody's
balanced toward a masculine, look at me.

218
00:16:45,214 --> 00:16:47,799
I can't see. That's why I hold them far away.

219
00:16:48,133 --> 00:16:50,385
- All right.
- Yeah, it is all right.

220
00:16:50,469 --> 00:16:51,595
No, all right.

221
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,639
I was gonna do this. That's what I wanna do.

222
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,683
But I know I can't see
so I hold them out there to look at them.

223
00:16:56,767 --> 00:16:57,768
All right.

224
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:12,324
Don't give me that look.
I see you looking at me.

225
00:17:15,577 --> 00:17:17,704
- Are you gay?
- What the fuck.

226
00:17:18,163 --> 00:17:20,082
No. I'm not gay!

227
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:23,460
Why do you look at me and think I'm gay?

228
00:17:23,502 --> 00:17:25,003
I'm not fucking gay!

229
00:17:25,045 --> 00:17:27,881
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm fucking sure.

230
00:17:30,092 --> 00:17:32,511
You know what, I bet you're right.

231
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:35,305
- Thank you.
- It wasn't a compliment.

232
00:17:35,389 --> 00:17:39,476
Ricki, whatever your real name is,
all right, this is my eyes.

233
00:17:41,562 --> 00:17:45,315
Look how I'm acting.
You're driving me crazy.

234
00:17:46,108 --> 00:17:49,152
You give me a fucking headache.

235
00:17:50,237 --> 00:17:55,033
I don't even know why I had a crush on you,
back a long time ago when I first met you...

236
00:17:55,659 --> 00:17:57,578
that you really cured me of.

237
00:17:59,621 --> 00:18:01,081
I don't know.

238
00:18:01,373 --> 00:18:04,209
Maybe it's because you know
I can kick your ass.

239
00:18:04,751 --> 00:18:06,712
Maybe that turns you on.

240
00:18:08,046 --> 00:18:09,923
You cannot kick my ass.

241
00:18:30,736 --> 00:18:31,820
What?

242
00:18:36,241 --> 00:18:37,868
You need a woman.

243
00:18:39,453 --> 00:18:40,787
I got one.

244
00:18:41,914 --> 00:18:42,998
Stop.

245
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:46,460
Kiss me again.

246
00:18:49,838 --> 00:18:51,715
I thought you wanted to be my bitch.

247
00:18:53,592 --> 00:18:55,427
This is so fucked up.

248
00:19:18,325 --> 00:19:21,286
- Where you going?
- It's turkey time.

249
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:28,418
Gobble, gobble.

250
00:19:29,962 --> 00:19:31,046
What?

251
00:19:32,631 --> 00:19:34,216
Now, you talk the talk...

252
00:19:34,299 --> 00:19:36,927
you know I'm expecting
you to walk the walk. Come on.

253
00:19:36,969 --> 00:19:39,930
Show me what I've been missing
my whole life.

254
00:19:39,972 --> 00:19:42,182
Lay some of that sweet "heterolingus"
on me.

255
00:19:48,438 --> 00:19:49,773
I think...

256
00:19:50,649 --> 00:19:52,276
to be serious...

257
00:19:53,735 --> 00:19:56,071
I just... You know, I think...

258
00:19:56,655 --> 00:19:59,491
I was thinking, you know,
and you were right...

259
00:19:59,575 --> 00:20:02,452
when you said probably,
actually a woman might know more...

260
00:20:02,494 --> 00:20:06,456
about what feels better to another woman.
She's a woman herself.

261
00:20:06,707 --> 00:20:10,502
A guy might be at a certain disadvantage.
You know, like...

262
00:20:11,837 --> 00:20:15,716
It's like, you need a handicap.
You know, like golf.

263
00:20:18,719 --> 00:20:20,721
Shut up and get over here.

264
00:22:10,622 --> 00:22:12,416
God bless you, penis.

265
00:22:14,334 --> 00:22:15,878
What'd you say?

266
00:22:18,255 --> 00:22:19,506
Nothing.

267
00:22:22,926 --> 00:22:25,721
Every relationship has a bull and a cow?

268
00:22:27,139 --> 00:22:28,640
That's right.

269
00:22:47,159 --> 00:22:49,745
Just to be up front about all this...

270
00:22:51,038 --> 00:22:52,998
when this gig is over...

271
00:22:54,499 --> 00:22:57,586
I want you to know
that I'm going to be leaving.

272
00:23:18,732 --> 00:23:19,775
{y:i}Listen...

273
00:23:19,858 --> 00:23:22,861
you and Trixie over there,
meet me at Beverly and Lomitas.

274
00:23:23,403 --> 00:23:24,863
Louis, what's going on?

275
00:23:25,197 --> 00:23:27,074
And don't bring the thing.

276
00:23:27,616 --> 00:23:30,160
- The what?
{y:i}- The thing. Don't bring it.

277
00:23:30,244 --> 00:23:31,328
What thing?

278
00:23:31,662 --> 00:23:34,289
The thing. Don't bring... Don't bring it.

279
00:23:35,374 --> 00:23:37,668
- You mean the...
{y:i}- Yeah. Don't bring it.

280
00:23:37,709 --> 00:23:40,212
{y:i}You leave it somewhere safe
{y:i}for the time being.

281
00:23:40,379 --> 00:23:42,005
- All right.
- You understand?

282
00:23:42,089 --> 00:23:44,633
{y:i}- Yeah, I understand.
- And hurry up, jackass.

283
00:23:46,552 --> 00:23:47,636
What?

284
00:23:48,637 --> 00:23:50,722
It's Louis. Fucking pissed.

285
00:23:51,849 --> 00:23:54,184
See this? Some cookies in there.

286
00:23:55,269 --> 00:23:56,520
Be back.

287
00:23:57,104 --> 00:23:59,147
- When are you coming back?
- Soon.

288
00:23:59,314 --> 00:24:03,068
- Just relax, eat your breakfast. Okay?
- I'm not hungry, though.

289
00:24:03,193 --> 00:24:06,905
Well, you can't skip breakfast.
It's a very important meal. All right?

290
00:24:06,989 --> 00:24:09,616
Don't go nowhere. Don't touch nothing.

291
00:24:09,992 --> 00:24:13,078
- Don't make phone calls. I'm not kidding.
- All right, Larry.

292
00:24:13,161 --> 00:24:14,872
All right. See you later.

293
00:24:15,038 --> 00:24:16,999
- Bye, Ricki.
- Bye, Brian.

294
00:24:28,635 --> 00:24:30,846
- What?
- Nothing.

295
00:24:39,188 --> 00:24:42,024
You know, I got this fantasy.

296
00:24:43,108 --> 00:24:44,610
About making it with a guy?

297
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,323
No.

298
00:24:50,616 --> 00:24:52,075
That's not it.

299
00:24:54,494 --> 00:24:58,207
Going somewhere, you know,
like, somewhere really...

300
00:25:02,336 --> 00:25:03,504
clean.

301
00:25:05,672 --> 00:25:07,633
- Clean?
- Yeah.

302
00:25:09,009 --> 00:25:13,096
No scumbags telling you what to do.
Nobody yelling at you all the time.

303
00:25:14,097 --> 00:25:16,225
Someplace you could just be.

304
00:25:20,062 --> 00:25:21,480
Be yourself.

305
00:25:24,942 --> 00:25:26,401
No bad stuff.

306
00:25:31,323 --> 00:25:32,950
That sounds good.

307
00:25:48,048 --> 00:25:51,510
- What's up?
- We have a visitor from New York.

308
00:25:53,512 --> 00:25:54,847
Follow me.

309
00:26:05,566 --> 00:26:06,775
Hello.

310
00:26:08,569 --> 00:26:11,905
- Welcome. Nice to meet you.
- Hello, sir.

311
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:13,866
Finally. Nice to meet you, too.

312
00:26:14,157 --> 00:26:16,326
Come. Look at you. Beautiful.

313
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:19,204
Come on in. Here. Grab a couch.

314
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:20,873
Sit, sit.

315
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:24,001
I say everything twice. In, in. Sit, sit.

316
00:26:24,793 --> 00:26:27,212
I'm so glad you could come...

317
00:26:27,796 --> 00:26:31,675
on such a short notice, too.
Thank you, I really appreciate it.

318
00:26:31,717 --> 00:26:36,013
I really... I thank you.
I appreciate it. Here, I've got some stuff.

319
00:26:36,346 --> 00:26:40,809
I'm sorry if I'm a bit of a mess,
but I just got in a few hours ago.

320
00:26:41,643 --> 00:26:45,522
I'm sure Louis told you,
you know, I'm having...

321
00:26:45,898 --> 00:26:49,026
some little legal problems
out here right now.

322
00:26:50,235 --> 00:26:54,698
What are you gonna do? It's a nuisance,
but what are you going to do?

323
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:56,992
I got to fight it, right?

324
00:26:58,076 --> 00:27:01,580
I mean, I can't go to jail.
That just can't happen.

325
00:27:02,581 --> 00:27:04,458
I'm used to the finer things.

326
00:27:04,708 --> 00:27:07,085
- Louis, am I right?
- You are right.

327
00:27:08,587 --> 00:27:11,715
It can't be. So I think we can say...

328
00:27:12,716 --> 00:27:16,094
beyond a shadow of a doubt,
that it's not gonna happen.

329
00:27:21,892 --> 00:27:24,311
Somewhere a mistake has been made.

330
00:27:27,523 --> 00:27:29,024
Did you know...

331
00:27:30,567 --> 00:27:32,653
that apparently some people...

332
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:36,406
do not regard the thumb,
technically, to be a finger?

333
00:27:40,285 --> 00:27:43,163
Curious for myself, I turned to Louis here...

334
00:27:43,455 --> 00:27:47,709
who with his newfound dictionary skills
looked it up for me.

335
00:27:48,293 --> 00:27:50,587
- You know what it said?
- No.

336
00:27:51,755 --> 00:27:53,382
Tell him what it said, Louis.

337
00:27:54,633 --> 00:27:55,884
It said, quote:

338
00:27:55,968 --> 00:28:00,556
"The short, thick, inner digit of the hand
next to the forefinger." Unquote.

339
00:28:00,806 --> 00:28:03,433
Now it said, "digit," not "finger."

340
00:28:03,684 --> 00:28:08,355
So I still don't really know, technically,
if it's considered a finger or not.

341
00:28:08,856 --> 00:28:10,399
- Right?
- Right.

342
00:28:11,733 --> 00:28:13,569
Right. Look at him. I love him.

343
00:28:14,069 --> 00:28:17,906
I love this guy. He eats no matter what.
I love you, Louis.

344
00:28:18,323 --> 00:28:19,741
What's this?

345
00:28:20,325 --> 00:28:22,452
What is this? Louis.

346
00:28:23,662 --> 00:28:25,706
I've been subpoenaed.

347
00:28:27,708 --> 00:28:30,919
I can't be consorting with armed felons.

348
00:28:33,297 --> 00:28:35,591
A little consideration, please.

349
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:40,012
Besides, you think something like this
is necessary...

350
00:28:40,095 --> 00:28:42,222
anyway, to intimidate people?

351
00:28:45,475 --> 00:28:48,020
I say intimidation comes from within.

352
00:28:48,103 --> 00:28:51,481
There are a multitude of qualities
an individual can possess...

353
00:28:51,523 --> 00:28:53,609
that make them intimidating.

354
00:28:53,692 --> 00:28:57,404
Not only this, this is the outside.
Then there's the inside.

355
00:28:58,238 --> 00:29:01,450
But you know
what's the most intimidating quality?

356
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:03,452
Not that you asked.

357
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:06,914
But the absolutely most intimidating
in my opinion?

358
00:29:07,289 --> 00:29:10,209
When an individual just doesn't give a shit.

359
00:29:11,084 --> 00:29:14,713
- Louis, you want to go to medical school?
- Medical school?

360
00:29:17,382 --> 00:29:18,467
Yes!

361
00:29:21,637 --> 00:29:25,682
Students there
can always use something to learn on.

362
00:29:31,313 --> 00:29:33,273
I feel like I'm floating.

363
00:29:35,567 --> 00:29:36,610
I feel...

364
00:29:38,237 --> 00:29:39,530
released.

365
00:29:43,492 --> 00:29:45,244
I don't give a shit.

366
00:29:46,662 --> 00:29:47,871
I don't.

367
00:29:58,215 --> 00:30:00,968
I have no compunctions...

368
00:30:02,261 --> 00:30:04,680
none whatsoever.

369
00:30:08,767 --> 00:30:10,811
And I am very concerned...

370
00:30:12,396 --> 00:30:15,774
about the way things have turned out here.

371
00:30:24,116 --> 00:30:25,951
How was the bleeding?

372
00:30:30,539 --> 00:30:31,790
The bleeding?

373
00:30:32,207 --> 00:30:34,459
No, not him.

374
00:30:36,128 --> 00:30:38,797
The retard, when you cut his thumb off.

375
00:30:39,715 --> 00:30:43,010
Louis told me you were concerned.

376
00:30:49,266 --> 00:30:50,601
Bleeding was fine.

377
00:30:52,644 --> 00:30:53,770
Fine?

378
00:30:54,688 --> 00:30:56,398
It was all right.

379
00:30:59,651 --> 00:31:01,653
Okay. Good.

380
00:31:08,744 --> 00:31:13,373
I didn't need your help, you know.
I could have beaten these charges.

381
00:31:15,626 --> 00:31:17,503
What were you thinking?

382
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:21,048
You were gonna extort a federal prosecutor.

383
00:31:22,424 --> 00:31:24,510
You thought you could say:

384
00:31:26,512 --> 00:31:31,058
"Kidnapped your little brother,
drop all charges," and the guy'd roll over?

385
00:31:33,143 --> 00:31:36,647
You didn't think
all hell wouldn't break loose?

386
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:41,401
You didn't think every fucking fed...

387
00:31:42,194 --> 00:31:44,613
wouldn't drop what they were doing...

388
00:31:44,738 --> 00:31:48,075
and dive in to protect one of their own?

389
00:31:49,993 --> 00:31:52,579
What do you morons think...

390
00:31:53,163 --> 00:31:55,374
this is Little Italy?

391
00:31:57,251 --> 00:31:58,460
Wake up!

392
00:31:58,544 --> 00:32:02,172
This is the twenty-fucking-first century!

393
00:32:16,645 --> 00:32:17,855
So now...

394
00:32:21,608 --> 00:32:23,151
things are bad.

395
00:32:25,571 --> 00:32:28,490
And whether you wanna call a thumb...

396
00:32:28,949 --> 00:32:31,410
a finger or a digit...

397
00:32:31,994 --> 00:32:35,914
for the sake of this discussion,
it doesn't really matter.

398
00:32:36,373 --> 00:32:37,833
You know why?

399
00:32:38,584 --> 00:32:41,837
Because whatever you choose to call it...

400
00:32:43,255 --> 00:32:44,590
a thumb...

401
00:32:45,424 --> 00:32:47,176
has a fingerprint...

402
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:50,888
and the one you sent...

403
00:32:51,847 --> 00:32:55,058
had the wrong fucking one.

404
00:32:58,228 --> 00:33:01,773
- Mr. Starkman...
- I know my fucking name...

405
00:33:02,191 --> 00:33:04,193
you piece of shit!

406
00:33:09,615 --> 00:33:12,242
You don't try to extort...

407
00:33:12,284 --> 00:33:15,829
a federal fucking prosecutor!

408
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:20,250
And if you do...

409
00:33:22,753 --> 00:33:25,923
you don't fuck around!

410
00:33:31,803 --> 00:33:33,138
Fuck this.

411
00:33:33,555 --> 00:33:35,390
Cutting off his thumb was a stupid order.

412
00:33:35,474 --> 00:33:39,436
We would have been derelict
in our responsibilities if we had followed it.

413
00:33:41,146 --> 00:33:42,272
Hello.

414
00:33:42,314 --> 00:33:44,316
How long could we have kept below radar...

415
00:33:44,358 --> 00:33:46,693
with a thumbless, bleeding half-wit?

416
00:33:47,694 --> 00:33:49,696
You see, sometimes...

417
00:33:50,155 --> 00:33:54,117
one has to use
their professional prerogative...

418
00:33:55,077 --> 00:33:57,246
to override a dumb request.

419
00:33:59,373 --> 00:34:01,083
With all due respect...

420
00:34:01,166 --> 00:34:04,253
even at this point if you were to ask us...

421
00:34:04,837 --> 00:34:08,090
to pursue a course of action that would be...

422
00:34:08,632 --> 00:34:12,010
let's say, contrary to your best interests...

423
00:34:12,845 --> 00:34:15,222
then as awkward as it might be...

424
00:34:16,390 --> 00:34:18,225
we would have to take exception.

425
00:34:23,856 --> 00:34:26,316
Aside from those of us in this room...

426
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:29,987
there's only one person, really,
that can link you to this fuckup.

427
00:34:32,114 --> 00:34:34,867
And I feel that we should...

428
00:34:36,535 --> 00:34:39,246
rectify that problem as soon as we can.

429
00:34:42,207 --> 00:34:45,335
I think I'd much prefer just to...

430
00:34:46,962 --> 00:34:48,297
you know...

431
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,508
end it right here.

432
00:34:54,928 --> 00:34:58,223
And that would be
your professional prerogative.

433
00:34:59,099 --> 00:35:02,144
If you think that having
that kid picked up by the authorities...

434
00:35:02,227 --> 00:35:06,565
and telling them all about being kidnapped
in an attempt to save your ass makes sense.

435
00:35:07,941 --> 00:35:11,028
If you think that's the best tactic
to keep you out of jail.

436
00:35:12,029 --> 00:35:15,824
If you think that's any less dumb
than asking to have his finger cut off...

437
00:35:16,617 --> 00:35:20,078
well, then that would be
the thing that you should do.

438
00:35:23,707 --> 00:35:25,417
But if you don't...

439
00:35:26,251 --> 00:35:28,754
then let us take the thorn out of your side.

440
00:35:29,505 --> 00:35:33,926
Let us make sure that kid will never be
able to testify against anybody.

441
00:35:36,845 --> 00:35:39,765
And if after that you're still not happy...

442
00:35:41,099 --> 00:35:43,185
then we can all talk again.

443
00:35:51,485 --> 00:35:54,363
- You were kidding, right?
- What do you think?

444
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:58,116
We'll take Brian back
to where you found him and get out of here.

445
00:35:59,785 --> 00:36:01,286
Are we going to the Baywatch now?

446
00:36:01,954 --> 00:36:05,082
No, we can't go to the Baywatch now.
Take you later.

447
00:36:10,671 --> 00:36:12,631
Maybe this is it. Maybe this is the thing.

448
00:36:12,673 --> 00:36:15,676
Maybe this is a sign coming from nowhere,
from out of the blue...

449
00:36:15,759 --> 00:36:20,138
just telling me it's time. It's time to get out.
It's time to do it.

450
00:36:28,188 --> 00:36:31,233
{y:i}When I'm alone in my room
{y:i}Sometimes I stare at the wall

451
00:36:31,316 --> 00:36:34,194
{y:i}and in the back of my mind
{y:i}I hear my conscience call

452
00:36:34,278 --> 00:36:37,155
{y:i}telling me I need a girl
{y:i}who's as sweet as a dove

453
00:36:37,239 --> 00:36:40,534
{y:i}For the first time in my life I see
{y:i}I need love

454
00:36:40,659 --> 00:36:43,996
{y:i}So if you know who you are
{y:i}why don't you make yourself seen

455
00:36:44,162 --> 00:36:47,499
{y:i}take a chance with my love
{y:i}you'll find out what I mean

456
00:36:47,541 --> 00:36:49,126
{y:i}I need love

457
00:36:54,173 --> 00:36:55,340
{y:i}I need love

458
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:58,427
Let me ask you something.
You got a girlfriend?

459
00:37:02,890 --> 00:37:04,308
No, I don't.

460
00:37:05,392 --> 00:37:06,894
Let me do something for you.

461
00:37:06,977 --> 00:37:10,856
You know, make up for all the problems
I caused you.

462
00:37:12,024 --> 00:37:15,611
Because I see you're a little nervous
around women. Right?

463
00:37:15,861 --> 00:37:19,907
Let me tell you something. You got
no reason to be shy. There's no magic to it.

464
00:37:20,073 --> 00:37:24,953
Let me tell you this thing that I heard,
and I'm starting to believe that it's true.

465
00:37:25,162 --> 00:37:26,455
You know?

466
00:37:26,538 --> 00:37:30,125
It's that the thing
you're most afraid of in life...

467
00:37:30,584 --> 00:37:34,755
if you do it, if you step up,
good things will happen.

468
00:37:35,506 --> 00:37:38,675
You see a girl that you like
that you're scared to talk to...

469
00:37:38,759 --> 00:37:40,469
bro, step up.

470
00:37:41,929 --> 00:37:43,263
Go up to her and say:

471
00:37:43,722 --> 00:37:47,017
"Hi, how are you today?
Nice weather we're having."

472
00:37:47,059 --> 00:37:50,521
Take it from there,
wherever the conversation goes. You try it.

473
00:37:50,604 --> 00:37:53,106
Try it with me. Practice. Go ahead.

474
00:37:53,273 --> 00:37:54,858
Hello, how are you today?

475
00:37:55,984 --> 00:37:58,195
Try it with me. Go ahead. Just say it.

476
00:37:59,404 --> 00:38:01,406
Hello, how are you today?

477
00:38:03,408 --> 00:38:05,410
Come on, Brian. Hello.

478
00:38:09,456 --> 00:38:10,749
How are you today?

479
00:38:12,209 --> 00:38:13,877
"How are you today?"

480
00:38:14,253 --> 00:38:16,296
Nice weather we're having.

481
00:38:19,842 --> 00:38:21,343
"Nice weather we're having."

482
00:38:21,552 --> 00:38:25,430
There you go. You see how he did it?
It's because you stepped up, Brian.

483
00:38:25,472 --> 00:38:29,351
If you're afraid, step up and good things
start to happen. Am I right?

484
00:38:30,894 --> 00:38:33,647
- I stepped up.
- Step it up, pimp.

485
00:38:34,439 --> 00:38:36,692
That's how you move. Step it up.

486
00:38:48,787 --> 00:38:51,748
So, now that we're partners in crime...

487
00:38:52,791 --> 00:38:54,877
how about telling me your real name.

488
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:58,547
The reason that I ask that...

489
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:02,092
is because I don't know
if you gave it any thought since last night...

490
00:39:02,301 --> 00:39:03,677
but I've been thinking about it.

491
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:08,473
And seeing... You know, looks like
now we're both going to be leaving.

492
00:39:09,808 --> 00:39:11,852
So I thought, you know...

493
00:39:12,227 --> 00:39:13,812
All right, look.

494
00:39:13,979 --> 00:39:16,732
I'm gonna lay it all out there for you
right now.

495
00:39:16,815 --> 00:39:20,861
I'm just gonna say it,
because, you know, here I am.

496
00:39:21,987 --> 00:39:23,614
- I think...
- Larry.

497
00:39:25,616 --> 00:39:28,785
You know I haven't done
this kind of thing hardly ever.

498
00:39:28,827 --> 00:39:30,370
The whole man thing...

499
00:39:30,454 --> 00:39:33,707
doesn't really
hold that much for me, usually.

500
00:39:34,499 --> 00:39:35,709
I know.

501
00:39:36,668 --> 00:39:38,795
But somehow you got through.

502
00:39:40,631 --> 00:39:41,840
Somehow.

503
00:39:45,219 --> 00:39:46,845
But in the end...

504
00:39:49,181 --> 00:39:53,685
I don't think
I could ever be what you really want.

505
00:40:08,367 --> 00:40:12,120
- So where do you think you'll go?
- I don't know.

506
00:40:16,792 --> 00:40:18,377
Somewhere clean.

507
00:40:22,714 --> 00:40:25,133
You know, Northern California...

508
00:40:26,301 --> 00:40:27,761
Oregon maybe.

509
00:40:28,846 --> 00:40:31,723
You could just drop me off
near the Pacific Coast Highway...

510
00:40:31,765 --> 00:40:34,726
- and I'll figure it out from there.
- Okay.

511
00:40:36,478 --> 00:40:40,774
After that, Brian,
I think it's gonna be time to go home.

512
00:40:43,861 --> 00:40:46,196
We just left there a little while ago, though.

513
00:40:46,238 --> 00:40:49,616
I don't mean my apartment.
I mean, you know, the place where you live.

514
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:51,285
Where I got you.

515
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:55,956
What, you mean to stay?

516
00:40:57,749 --> 00:40:59,543
Yeah, buddy. To stay.

517
00:41:57,893 --> 00:41:59,269
Oh, my God.

518
00:42:07,819 --> 00:42:10,447
- It's open. Oh, my God.
- What are you doing? Sit down.

519
00:42:10,489 --> 00:42:12,908
- Oh, my God. I'm gonna go.
- Brian, what?

520
00:42:12,991 --> 00:42:14,785
- What's he talking about?
- They're open.

521
00:42:17,496 --> 00:42:20,499
They're open. Oh, my God. The Baywatch.

522
00:42:21,083 --> 00:42:22,334
They're open!

523
00:42:24,044 --> 00:42:25,712
- Cowabunga!
- Oh, my God.

524
00:42:25,796 --> 00:42:27,130
That's the Baywatch?

525
00:42:27,381 --> 00:42:29,258
It's open. It's the Baywatch.

526
00:42:30,425 --> 00:42:31,802
Hello there!

527
00:42:33,762 --> 00:42:35,931
I can't believe this.

528
00:42:36,431 --> 00:42:39,142
- I can't believe. Stop.
- We can't stop now.

529
00:42:39,268 --> 00:42:41,812
No, we have to stop!

530
00:42:41,895 --> 00:42:45,440
No, Larry, no! They're here. We're here.

531
00:42:46,567 --> 00:42:49,653
I know. We can't, though. I'm sorry.
We can't stop.

532
00:42:49,695 --> 00:42:51,488
- We're here. Come on.
- We're here.

533
00:42:51,530 --> 00:42:53,031
- We're right here.
- Brian.

534
00:42:53,115 --> 00:42:55,534
Wait. That's it. We're right here.

535
00:43:00,038 --> 00:43:03,667
Wait a second.
Wait. So turn around now, okay?

536
00:43:17,306 --> 00:43:18,640
All right.

537
00:43:22,811 --> 00:43:24,479
What do you think?

538
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:34,031
- Can I go down there?
- Brian, you can't go down there, no.

539
00:43:36,074 --> 00:43:38,702
I mean, we're not allowed down there.

540
00:43:39,745 --> 00:43:41,496
Plus, we got to go soon.

541
00:43:42,789 --> 00:43:45,876
Please? Please, can I go down there?

542
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:49,171
You know, Brian, I don't even think...

543
00:43:50,756 --> 00:43:54,843
This might not even be the Baywatch.
I think this is probably something else.

544
00:43:58,430 --> 00:44:00,307
Larry, you promised me.

545
00:44:03,101 --> 00:44:04,686
You promised me.

546
00:44:10,734 --> 00:44:13,237
- It's right there.
- I know.

547
00:44:14,530 --> 00:44:16,365
Just for five minutes?

548
00:44:22,371 --> 00:44:24,790
Brian, what's your brother's name?

549
00:44:27,876 --> 00:44:31,421
My brother's name is stinky Jimmy Dorf.
Want to know why?

550
00:44:32,089 --> 00:44:34,216
Yeah, some other time, I do.

551
00:44:34,508 --> 00:44:38,387
Yeah, Los Angeles. The U.S. Courthouse.
The office of a James Dorf.

552
00:44:39,972 --> 00:44:43,600
- Because... Do you want to know why?
- Yeah.

553
00:44:44,643 --> 00:44:46,728
Because sometimes he smells like fish.

554
00:44:47,354 --> 00:44:48,647
No, I don't think so.

555
00:44:48,772 --> 00:44:52,693
Yeah, I'll give you my name.
Give me a minute. Hold on. I forgot it.

556
00:45:06,790 --> 00:45:08,458
Brian, look at me.

557
00:45:10,043 --> 00:45:14,339
I think your brother and his friends
are gonna be here soon to pick you up.

558
00:45:14,381 --> 00:45:15,382
Okay?

559
00:45:19,136 --> 00:45:21,305
I want you to know something.

560
00:45:23,557 --> 00:45:24,808
You're a good kid.

561
00:45:26,935 --> 00:45:29,062
I'm sorry about all the...

562
00:45:32,524 --> 00:45:34,443
I'm sorry for being...

563
00:45:42,618 --> 00:45:43,952
I'm sorry.

564
00:45:49,791 --> 00:45:51,084
I think you're wrong.

565
00:45:53,879 --> 00:45:56,298
I think that is the Baywatch right there.

566
00:46:01,094 --> 00:46:03,013
Who knows. Maybe it is.

567
00:46:05,098 --> 00:46:08,227
I'm a genius, man. I knew it.

568
00:46:11,897 --> 00:46:14,525
You take good care of yourself, Brian.

569
00:46:26,370 --> 00:46:28,789
You take good care of yourself, Larry.

570
00:46:31,667 --> 00:46:32,876
I'll do that.

571
00:46:36,213 --> 00:46:39,842
Brian, let me ask you something.
How do your fingernails look?

572
00:46:41,385 --> 00:46:44,263
- My fingernails?
- Your fingernails, how are they looking?

573
00:46:48,767 --> 00:46:51,478
- Don't say nothing.
- They look very good.

574
00:46:52,354 --> 00:46:54,273
I got A-plus nails.

575
00:46:55,107 --> 00:46:58,193
- I give an A-plus for fingernails.
- Never mind. Okay. Good.

576
00:46:58,694 --> 00:46:59,695
Go ahead.

577
00:47:10,789 --> 00:47:11,957
Go on.

578
00:47:18,797 --> 00:47:22,301
I don't know how you're thinking
about getting out of here or whatever...

579
00:47:22,384 --> 00:47:24,261
what your plans are...

580
00:47:27,681 --> 00:47:29,766
but I think you should take my car.

581
00:47:31,310 --> 00:47:33,437
Go ahead, take it. Take it.

582
00:47:36,648 --> 00:47:38,692
I couldn't do that, Larry.

583
00:47:42,946 --> 00:47:46,033
I'd rather...
You know, I'd prefer if you had it.

584
00:47:46,992 --> 00:47:50,037
It's a good car,
and I want you to be all right.

585
00:47:50,913 --> 00:47:54,625
And I know that
it'll get you wherever you need to go.

586
00:47:54,666 --> 00:47:56,793
So just, you know, take it.

587
00:47:57,002 --> 00:47:59,338
I was thinking
about getting rid of it anyway.

588
00:48:00,506 --> 00:48:02,758
I'm trying to change my image.

589
00:48:07,513 --> 00:48:09,139
Go ahead, take it.

590
00:48:12,809 --> 00:48:13,977
Please.

591
00:48:22,694 --> 00:48:23,820
Okay.

592
00:48:26,031 --> 00:48:28,784
- I will, thank you.
- Don't mention it.

593
00:48:30,285 --> 00:48:32,496
Just do me one favor, though.

594
00:48:34,331 --> 00:48:35,541
Name it.

595
00:48:36,291 --> 00:48:40,254
As far as the lesbian thing goes...

596
00:48:42,297 --> 00:48:43,382
Yeah?

597
00:48:44,883 --> 00:48:47,427
...if you do ever think
about hopping the fence...

598
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:51,557
promise you'll give me a call first.

599
00:49:43,275 --> 00:49:46,153
{y:i}Okay, ladies and gentlemen, listen up.

600
00:49:48,030 --> 00:49:50,365
{y:i}Camera is ready and picture is up.

601
00:49:50,449 --> 00:49:54,077
{y:i}I need all dancers to first position
{y:i}as soon as possible.

602
00:49:54,453 --> 00:49:57,706
{y:i}All dancers to first position
{y:i}as soon as possible. Let's go.

603
00:50:37,079 --> 00:50:41,542
{y:i}Okay, listen up, guys.
{y:i}Can we please finish pairing up, everyone?

604
00:50:41,750 --> 00:50:44,628
{y:i}Come on, guys,
{y:i}it's not like you're mating for life.

605
00:50:44,795 --> 00:50:47,464
{y:i}As the old song goes. ;
{y:i}"just love the one you're with."

606
00:50:47,631 --> 00:50:49,424
{y:i}Find someone to love.

607
00:51:15,909 --> 00:51:18,078
Come on, Brian. Dance with someone.

608
00:51:25,127 --> 00:51:26,628
Nice weather we're having.

609
00:51:28,213 --> 00:51:30,340
Yes, it's very nice.

610
00:51:38,974 --> 00:51:39,975
It is?

611
00:51:41,894 --> 00:51:46,148
Yes. But the weather's always very nice
around here, isn't it?

612
00:51:47,232 --> 00:51:48,275
Yes.

613
00:51:51,236 --> 00:51:54,865
And a 10% chance of precipitation
for low-lying coastal regions...

614
00:51:54,907 --> 00:51:57,826
extending from New South Wales to Victoria.

615
00:52:06,376 --> 00:52:08,003
{y:i}And playback.

616
00:52:09,713 --> 00:52:11,465
{y:i}And action.

617
00:53:40,512 --> 00:53:41,763
Rochelle.

618
00:53:43,515 --> 00:53:44,474
What?

619
00:53:45,517 --> 00:53:48,353
Rochelle. That's my real name.

620
00:54:00,908 --> 00:54:02,868
So, Rochelle...

621
00:54:04,661 --> 00:54:06,997
does this mean
you decided to hop the fence?

622
00:54:07,623 --> 00:54:09,166
I wouldn't go that far.

623
00:54:10,334 --> 00:54:13,712
But I figured
since I helped get you into all this...

624
00:54:14,838 --> 00:54:18,175
the least I could do
is offer you a ride out of town.

625
00:54:20,177 --> 00:54:21,553
Fair enough.

626
00:54:37,194 --> 00:54:38,278
What?

627
00:54:39,571 --> 00:54:42,824
You know,
I bet you'd look awesome in some mascara.

628
00:54:47,704 --> 00:54:50,999
- I'm not sure how to take that.
- It's a compliment.

629
00:54:51,708 --> 00:54:52,793
Yeah?

630
00:54:53,335 --> 00:54:57,214
Like your mother said,
life's not always black-and-white.

631
00:54:58,632 --> 00:55:00,300
Sometimes you just never know.

632
00:55:01,260 --> 00:55:03,220
Are you driving or bullshitting?

633
00:55:05,305 --> 00:55:06,723
I'm driving.

634
00:58:25,172 --> 00:58:28,842
{y:i}I like big butts and I cannot lie

635
00:58:29,092 --> 00:58:31,261
{y:i}The other brothers can't deny

636
00:58:31,303 --> 00:58:33,639
{y:i}When the girls walk in
{y:i}with an itty-bitty waist

637
00:58:33,722 --> 00:58:37,893
{y:i}And round things in your face
{y:i}You get sprung, wanna pull up tough

638
00:58:37,976 --> 00:58:40,103
{y:i}'Cause you noticed that butt was stuffed

639
00:58:40,187 --> 00:58:42,523
{y:i}'Cause I'm long, and I'm strong

640
00:58:42,606 --> 00:58:44,274
{y:i}And I'm down to get the friction on

641
00:58:44,316 --> 00:58:45,984
{y:i}So, ladies, yeah

642
00:58:46,068 --> 00:58:47,069
{y:i}Ladies, yeah

643
00:58:47,152 --> 00:58:50,113
{y:i}If you wanna roll in my Mercedes
{y:i}Yeah

644
00:58:50,197 --> 00:58:54,368
{y:i}So turn around! Stick it out!
{y:i}Even white boys got to shout

645
00:58:54,451 --> 00:58:55,452
{y:i}Baby got back!

646
00:58:57,329 --> 00:58:58,830
{y:i}Baby got back!
