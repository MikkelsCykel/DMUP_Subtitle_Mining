1
00:01:52,114 --> 00:01:56,118
Have you heard about the penguin,
who crossed the Mojave wilderness?

2
00:01:56,243 --> 00:02:01,540
It is a true story. The
would not only cross the wilderness.

3
00:02:01,665 --> 00:02:04,543
It was late summer
in a Pinto from 1976.

4
00:02:04,668 --> 00:02:09,423
Pinto began
that sounds very strange.

5
00:02:09,548 --> 00:02:14,678
Imagine how nervous he was.
"No, no, no, gi, gi, gi."

6
00:02:14,803 --> 00:02:20,475
- Was it the car or the penguin?
- It was a penguin.

7
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:25,522
He tion and title browsing in a row vrksted.
He says to the mechanic:

8
00:02:25,647 --> 00:02:29,151
How do those things, brother?
Can you hjlpe me?

9
00:02:29,276 --> 00:02:36,450
The mechanic says, "Absolutely, obtuse,
but I have a little busy right now. "

10
00:02:36,575 --> 00:02:42,748
"There is an ice cream parlor on the second row
side of the street. "He deg inside.

11
00:02:42,873 --> 00:02:46,168
Jumps up onto a chair and ordering
a bger with vanilla ice cream.

12
00:02:46,293 --> 00:02:50,589
There is a problem.
He has svmmefdder.

13
00:02:50,714 --> 00:02:55,385
He can not stay in one place.
He looks at his ice cream ...

14
00:02:55,510 --> 00:03:01,183
"Shit." He dives into it.
He svmmer around the ice.

15
00:03:01,308 --> 00:03:05,103
He has ice everywhere.
He is famished.

16
00:03:05,228 --> 00:03:08,982
He eats ice
and deg the street to the mechanic.

17
00:03:09,107 --> 00:03:14,196
"What do you think?"
The mechanic looks on him and says:

18
00:03:14,321 --> 00:03:17,324
"It looks like you've sucked
a sl of. "

19
00:03:17,449 --> 00:03:23,705
"No, no, no, it's ice.
It's just ice. "Are you with me?

20
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:30,671
It is a true story.
It is true, but not funny.

21
00:03:34,841 --> 00:03:36,927
Wyatt, we are some streets vk.

22
00:03:37,052 --> 00:03:40,764
Trey and Franco is back.

27
00:04:40,365 --> 00:04:44,077
You could start to open

00:04:44,202 --> 00:04:48,206
Infuriate you not give up.
I, p a dangerous place.

29
00:04:48,332 --> 00:04:51,668
The gr probably not something that
sprger who one opens for.

30
00:04:51,793 --> 00:04:55,964
Now you know. Shut up!

31
00:04:56,089 --> 00:05:00,010
Okay, bitch, you fr what you want.

A cop is shot.

38
00:06:27,764 --> 00:06:33,854
Hold on, Dave.
A cop is shot.

39
00:06:35,105 --> 00:06:39,985

Hold on, Trey. They come.

00:07:56,603 --> 00:08:01,566
Bastards!
I have drbt Reno.

44
00:08:02,984 --> 00:08:06,988
It requires many more of you
to kill me.

45
00:08:11,993 --> 00:08:14,162
Bastards!

46
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:03,628

In addition to them here, we've grandmother
and his mother, younger brother and his sster.

50
00:10:16,326 --> 00:10:20,414
- What is the white powder?
- Fire extinguisher.

51
00:10:20,539 --> 00:10:25,794
This sounds a little absurd, but with
p tanks fire damage -

52
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:31,049
- And powder, it looks as though
they hldte gasoline on him, tndte -

53
00:10:31,174 --> 00:10:37,764
- And s off him. S reiterated
they do it at least twice to.

00:10:39,599 --> 00:10:44,730
- Who owns the place?
- A Malcolm Varanato.

55
00:10:44,855 --> 00:10:50,944
- Do you think Malcolm Varnado?
- Yes, you know him?

56
00:10:51,069 --> 00:10:55,032
He is a journalist p Picayune.
His older brother Weddo -

57
00:10:55,157 --> 00:10:58,035
- Is one of the biggest
narkoslgere in New Orleans.

58
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:05,375
- What does it mean?
- This is a little too big for us.

59
00:11:14,968 --> 00:11:19,806
I lessons might it now, Mike.

60
00:11:19,931 --> 00:11:22,434
Come in.

61
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:27,105
I shit p, what I've heard.
Truth can not be voted out.

62
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:32,319
I am exaggerating? Come over
and join us out p street.

63
00:11:33,278 --> 00:11:38,367
It was sad. Call back
if you will take it up again.

64
00:11:43,705 --> 00:11:51,421
I wish that one day
permit hunting p politicians.

65
00:11:51,546 --> 00:11:55,967
- How do those things, Pete?
- Good. Thank you peeped.

66
00:11:56,093 --> 00:12:00,389

- A couple of things.

68
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:08,563
- Journalist p Picayune.
- Weddos little brother.

69
00:12:08,689 --> 00:12:13,026
He is p rampage.

70
00:12:13,151 --> 00:12:18,407
He takes them fr us, we are fortunate
if we not only find snippets.

71
00:12:20,951 --> 00:12:28,709
It reminds me of the service, yes.
Homicide will have a Crimean from -

72
00:12:28,834 --> 00:12:34,131
- To hjlpe them, and ...
your name was nvnt.

73
00:12:35,757 --> 00:12:40,262
Sure.
That sounds fine.

74
00:12:40,387 --> 00:12:43,890
One more thing.

75
00:12:51,982 --> 00:12:57,154
Johnny Trans lawyer hvder,
that you are attempting to kill him.

76
00:13:00,323 --> 00:13:05,495
I afvbnede him.
He had a scale rows 15 cm.

77
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:08,623
He got off lightly.

78
00:13:08,749 --> 00:13:11,710
I've seen the pictures. It s out
as though a bomb had hit him.

79
00:13:11,835 --> 00:13:15,547
- Is that why I'm here?
- Yes, that's it.

80
00:13:15,672 --> 00:13:20,927
Four complaints a row and a monthly
gunfight. You are about to lose grip.

81
00:13:21,053 --> 00:13:27,100
- You blame me for Dave and Trey?
- No, what happened in the house afterwards?

82
00:13:28,935 --> 00:13:34,524
The internal public interrogation boys.
Do not you think they want to know -

83
00:13:34,649 --> 00:13:39,654
- Who SKD one guy p NRT team
and had an empty weapon in his hand?

84
00:13:40,947 --> 00:13:44,951
It requires not a genius
to understand what happened.

85
00:13:59,216 --> 00:14:04,554
I know what you wrestled with.

86
00:14:06,348 --> 00:14:10,644
I myself have vret there.
You know that.

87
00:14:13,563 --> 00:14:19,486
But you fortstter
p same mde ...

88
00:14:21,029 --> 00:14:24,616
... You will never
get back again.

89
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,963
- Was that all?
- Yes, that was it.

90
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:54,373
Hello. How do those things, brother?

91
00:15:55,248 --> 00:15:59,836
Colin, what the hell are you doing here?

92
00:15:59,961 --> 00:16:03,548
Is it sdan you greet p folks?

93
00:16:03,674 --> 00:16:07,969
How long as you have vret in town?

94
00:16:08,095 --> 00:16:14,101
- Where's the wife and Jacob?
- At her parents.

95
00:16:14,226 --> 00:16:18,563
- Come on, we grab a l.
- It has vret a fierce day.

96
00:16:18,689 --> 00:16:23,694
I deg to kjs.

97
00:16:23,819 --> 00:16:30,701
- Okay, we drink here.
- Wait a minute ... Okay, one drink.

98
00:16:30,826 --> 00:16:33,870
- You provide.
- Sdan, it sounds.

99
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:41,253
Two Jamie, darling.

100
00:16:44,131 --> 00:16:48,760
- Was the storm s really bad?
- Yes, dammit.

101
00:16:48,885 --> 00:16:53,306
How dmningerne burst
it looks like a bomb crater.

102
00:16:53,432 --> 00:16:56,393
Throughout the area is vk.

103
00:16:56,518 --> 00:17:02,399
The worst was seeing people wade
past corpses -

104
00:17:02,524 --> 00:17:05,485
- As if they were not there.

105
00:17:07,904 --> 00:17:15,203
Please know that I vrdstter,
you got my grandfather out.

106
00:17:16,621 --> 00:17:20,792
I krte past a house the other day
which was completely wiped out.

107
00:17:21,668 --> 00:17:25,255
- How is he?
- Good.

108
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:28,592
He has moved in with
its sster in Algiers.

109
00:17:28,717 --> 00:17:33,472
- And you?
- A little here and there, you know.

110
00:17:35,015 --> 00:17:38,935
I said from before you
immediately after Fallujah.

111
00:17:39,061 --> 00:17:42,564
I got a job at a security company.

112
00:17:43,482 --> 00:17:47,652
- Which team?
- Spartan.

113
00:17:48,487 --> 00:17:55,619
- They paid well.
- You must survive for f lnnen.

114
00:17:55,744 --> 00:18:01,124
And it says one who chose
being strmer in town.

115
00:18:01,249 --> 00:18:07,547
This is gonna be soon as Baghdad.
Thank you.

116
00:18:07,673 --> 00:18:12,761
- Why are you now?
- I do not know.

117
00:18:13,762 --> 00:18:18,809
I travel from town again.
I do not know if I come back.

118
00:18:18,934 --> 00:18:22,729
I would see you one last time.

119
00:18:22,854 --> 00:18:28,193
One last time? Where you going?
The big svn?

120
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:33,198
Have you ever done something ...

121
00:18:34,157 --> 00:18:38,370
... Which you really want,
that you could have done about?

122
00:18:38,495 --> 00:18:43,875
- You know that.
- Have you been able gre good again?

123
00:18:44,001 --> 00:18:47,379
No, it can not.

124
00:18:50,632 --> 00:18:53,844
That was what I thought of.

125
00:19:00,434 --> 00:19:04,312
Yes. Now? No, Lewis.

126
00:19:04,438 --> 00:19:07,774
No, it does not work.

127
00:19:07,899 --> 00:19:11,028
We mdes seafront.

128
00:19:14,948 --> 00:19:19,328
I turned on to g.
I have mde no.

129
00:19:19,453 --> 00:19:22,748
Are you saying that kind of
for s just that g?

130
00:19:22,873 --> 00:19:26,960
I was about to forget it. I
a fdselsdagsgave Jacob.

131
00:19:27,085 --> 00:19:31,840
It's the new movie with carat tiger.
I kbte in Bangkok.

132
00:19:31,965 --> 00:19:36,887
- It is not out yet. Watch it.
- Colin!

133
00:19:37,846 --> 00:19:41,933
What foregr there?

134
00:19:42,059 --> 00:19:45,854
- It was good to see you.
- Colin!

135
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:03,997
You said that you would have
a krekort, not a passport.

136
00:20:04,122 --> 00:20:08,460
- Yes, a Californian.
- It's okay.

137
00:20:14,091 --> 00:20:17,052
I lists behind you.

138
00:20:19,221 --> 00:20:24,476
Okay. You grasped it, Lewis?
Gr, and came over here again.

139
00:20:27,229 --> 00:20:31,858
Now it takes just a moment.
Are you ready?

140
00:20:35,028 --> 00:20:37,739
One, two ...

141
00:20:52,004 --> 00:20:53,964
Damn!

142
00:21:12,065 --> 00:21:15,318
It will do little harm.

143
00:21:20,574 --> 00:21:23,327
I have not done anything.

144
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:28,415
I knew him not once.

145
00:21:31,293 --> 00:21:33,670
I have not done anything.

146
00:21:51,355 --> 00:21:54,441
What are you doing? Stop!

147
00:22:39,986 --> 00:22:44,324
Lewis, it's Tom again.
I would just sl p trden.

148
00:22:44,449 --> 00:22:47,911
Sonny asked me to call you -

149
00:22:48,036 --> 00:22:51,707
- To hear if you could look into
the studio s soon as you can.

150
00:22:51,832 --> 00:22:55,293
Hber you are well. See you.

151
00:22:56,962 --> 00:23:00,424
This is ridiculous.

152
00:23:04,136 --> 00:23:07,305
Crowe!

153
00:23:13,186 --> 00:23:17,816
I do not think it succeeds.
He jumps not row it.

154
00:23:20,277 --> 00:23:25,699
Let me get some guys and see
what I can dig up.

155
00:23:25,824 --> 00:23:30,704
What do you say, Renko?
Come on. See you, boss.

156
00:23:57,189 --> 00:24:03,528
You know what, Sonny?
I was suddenly a mrkelig insight.

157
00:24:03,653 --> 00:24:07,491
You and I resemble each other enough
more than you thought.

158
00:24:07,616 --> 00:24:12,037
Hr here. We are both artists.

159
00:24:12,162 --> 00:24:17,668
We may well have chosen
working with different media ...

160
00:24:17,793 --> 00:24:21,004
... Or lrreder if you like.

161
00:24:21,129 --> 00:24:24,758
But we want both the same.

162
00:24:24,883 --> 00:24:31,264
We will communicate our innermost
thoughts and flelser.

163
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:33,975
Not true? What?

164
00:24:35,018 --> 00:24:37,229
Not true?

165
00:24:37,354 --> 00:24:45,612
Say it again, Sonny. Where were
your friend Lewis mde him?

166
00:24:45,737 --> 00:24:52,244
He should recover a GLD.
He brides VRE back now.

167
00:24:52,369 --> 00:24:56,999
- Where is he now?

00:26:12,157 --> 00:26:17,788
Try to track them. It gives
probably nothing, but you never know.

191
00:27:58,805 --> 00:28:03,685
- Can Weddo VRE involved?
- Think of you differently?

192
00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:06,730
I think not.

193
00:28:06,855 --> 00:28:11,610
But I do not know anyone who would
dare stte up against him.

194
00:28:11,735 --> 00:28:16,657

00:28:27,292 --> 00:28:32,339
Has this guy and Lewis

198
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:37,719
It sounds silly
but you should have mdt dog.

199
00:28:37,844 --> 00:28:42,057
It was like poodles movie star.
Just like Lassie.

00:39:20,278 --> 00:39:22,614

All are dead, Crowe.
Renko, Cole. The whole gang.

- Yes, no?

332
00:43:46,545 --> 00:43:50,048
Is there a mrs. Riley?

333
00:43:50,173 --> 00:43:54,469
- Yes, sometime.
- Any children?

334
00:43:54,594 --> 00:43:58,223
We had a son. His name was Jacob.

335
00:43:59,641 --> 00:44:07,399
He was six when he got leukmi.
Eighteen years later he died.

336
00:44:08,984 --> 00:44:12,279
She left me behind.

337
00:44:12,404 --> 00:44:17,701
She could probably not endure,
I reminded her of him.

338
00:44:19,828 --> 00:44:23,415
- I apologize.
- No, let VRE with it.

339
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:31,631
Normally, I find p something
to escape doing really pathetic.

340
00:44:32,716 --> 00:44:37,137
I said for the rest,
the wonderful family I have?

341
00:44:37,262 --> 00:44:40,807
Isr your little princess.

342
00:44:40,932 --> 00:44:45,771

Come on, champ.

343
00:44:46,646 --> 00:44:51,526

This benefits you receive?
Now we find a fireman's uniform.

345
00:44:57,908 --> 00:45:00,744
Thank you.

346
00:45:03,288 --> 00:45:07,542
It's a nice neighborhood.

347
00:45:09,670 --> 00:45:14,925
- What is it?
- I'm sorry.

348
00:45:15,050 --> 00:45:20,347
- I let you down.
- Nonsense.

349
00:45:20,472 --> 00:45:25,602
You responded that all
others would have done.

350
00:45:25,727 --> 00:45:29,106
You went p them as if
you had the odds on your side.

351
00:45:29,231 --> 00:45:33,318
It is not the same.
There is a difference.

352
00:45:36,905 --> 00:45:42,536
When you came on hjrnet today
s not you tell me.

353
00:45:42,661 --> 00:45:48,542
You s not mndene with weapon.
You s only your happy family.

354
00:45:49,334 --> 00:45:55,507
I do not have it to lose.
It's the difference.

355
00:45:59,428 --> 00:46:03,807
There is a blessing in everything.

356
00:46:03,932 --> 00:46:08,020
My father was a preacher.

357
00:46:09,229 --> 00:46:14,276
Was there something he lrte, s it was
that everything had a meaning.

358
00:46:14,401 --> 00:46:17,404
Do you think that p?

359
00:46:17,529 --> 00:46:24,870
What sense is there in
to a 4-rich suffer for two r?

360
00:46:24,995 --> 00:46:29,207
- Is there a sense in that?
- Consider the what happened today.

361
00:46:29,333 --> 00:46:33,462
If it was get different
s l i dd p street now.

362
00:46:33,587 --> 00:46:38,258
- It was intended that I should live.
- It's easy to say now.

363
00:46:38,383 --> 00:46:42,012
Are they not possible,
that what happened with your family -

364
00:46:42,137 --> 00:46:44,639
- Not only was
a an arbitrary accident?

365
00:46:44,765 --> 00:46:50,354
- There is perhaps a brain think?
- What do you mean?

366
00:46:50,479 --> 00:46:54,650
I do not think p miracles.
I'm not a saint.

367
00:46:54,775 --> 00:46:59,905
Today you were a saint
for me and my family.

368
00:47:01,698 --> 00:47:05,327
Okay, it's late.

369
00:47:05,452 --> 00:47:09,164
You m believe p, whatever you want,
s p I think what I want.

370
00:47:09,289 --> 00:47:12,834
- It's okay.

371
00:47:12,959 --> 00:47:17,214
What kind of a mine?
Want slbe me in church?

372
00:47:17,339 --> 00:47:21,718
- What about p Sunday?
- No.

373
00:47:22,844 --> 00:47:28,016
It's late. I gotta get
my ngler and you must sleep.

374
00:47:56,920 --> 00:48:01,591
Yes. No problems.
What happens?

375
00:48:02,926 --> 00:48:05,387
Where?

376
00:48:06,179 --> 00:48:09,391
I'm p road.

377
00:48:32,039 --> 00:48:37,294
- Hey, how do those things?
- Are you sure that it is her?

378
00:48:37,419 --> 00:48:43,717
You see, what that means? It
is not about Weddo, but about Colin.

379
00:48:43,842 --> 00:48:47,179
Could I track the other numbers
p Sonnys mobile?

380
00:48:47,304 --> 00:48:50,807
CreditCards p fupadresser.

381
00:48:50,932 --> 00:48:56,938
Look at the journalist's conversation lists on
same number pops up somewhere.

382
00:48:57,064 --> 00:49:02,194
- Do you think it's Colin?
- I m LBE.

383
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:12,079
- What have we here, Sean?
- It does not look good.

384
00:49:12,204 --> 00:49:15,916
- Do we know who it is?
- Her name is Stacey.

385
00:49:16,041 --> 00:49:22,214
We forhrte her gr She can
VRE associated with a possible mistnkt.

386
00:49:22,339 --> 00:49:30,180
A possible? S
suspicion degree heart now, huh?

387
00:49:30,305 --> 00:49:34,559
I'm sorry to say this, but I
was called by management.

391

Until tomorrow.

00:49:57,124 --> 00:50:00,794
- Are there other meetings?
- I think not.

393
00:50:00,919 --> 00:50:04,006
Damn.
I need your HJLP.

394
00:50:04,131 --> 00:50:08,593
Do you think that the techniques can accelerate
identification of the exchange of fire?

395
00:50:10,012 --> 00:50:13,682
- Sean ...
- Come on, Pete.

396
00:50:13,807 --> 00:50:17,436
I will do what I can.

397
00:50:24,401 --> 00:50:30,198

Someone killed my family.

411
00:53:21,870 --> 00:53:24,790
Grilled my brother alive.

412
00:53:24,915 --> 00:53:32,464
It took the only good,
the only pure, I've had.

413
00:53:33,298 --> 00:53:37,344
We do not know a damn thing.

414
00:53:37,469 --> 00:53:41,515
Wait. You have misforstet it.

415
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:45,686
- It's not about you.
- It's not about Malcolm.

416
00:53:45,811 --> 00:53:50,023
No, but on his job.

417
00:53:50,148 --> 00:53:55,112
Your brother was in the wrong place p
p the wrong time.

418
00:53:55,237 --> 00:54:01,702
I know what you want. I had done
the same, but it is not solutions.

419
00:54:01,827 --> 00:54:08,333
- What is a good solution enabling?
- Let us perform our work.

420
00:54:08,458 --> 00:54:15,048
Tracking people is what we are good at.
We find the bastard.

421
00:54:15,173 --> 00:54:21,680
He is right. We are your best bet
to convict them before leaving.

422
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:28,895
Okay ...

423
00:54:29,021 --> 00:54:36,403
We follows the rejection your rules, but I will
VRE a shadow that waits.

424
00:54:36,528 --> 00:54:43,076
This will not just blow over.
The bugger must both for it.

430
00:55:19,446 --> 00:55:23,241

- Lewis was Sonny guy.

431
00:55:23,367 --> 00:55:27,537
- And these?
- It's a little mrkeligt.

432
00:55:27,663 --> 00:55:33,043
All ID-papers are fake.

433
00:55:33,168 --> 00:55:39,216
No internet nonsense. Things of hj
quality. I thought they were genuine.

434
00:55:39,341 --> 00:55:43,470
Look at p beautiful over here.

435
00:55:44,388 --> 00:55:48,392
It is here you will find interesting.

436
00:55:48,517 --> 00:55:53,397
They dug them out of the shoulder.
They thought it was kulrester.

437
00:55:56,942 --> 00:56:00,570
- What is it?
- Shrapnel.

438
00:56:00,696 --> 00:56:07,327
I thought so also.
Watch it here.

439
00:56:13,959 --> 00:56:17,087
Techniques think it is from
a 3-0-8 or even larger.

440
00:56:17,212 --> 00:56:21,758
One of klerummet have a
Cyrillic tattoo needle arm -

441
00:56:21,883 --> 00:56:27,472
- And something resembling forbrndinger
from white phosphorus p whole back.

442
00:56:27,597 --> 00:56:31,435
- War injuries.
- It looks sdan out.

443
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:35,314
That explains a lot.

444
00:56:35,439 --> 00:56:41,153
In deg during the shooting.
Their weapon, tactics ...

445
00:56:41,278 --> 00:56:48,869
- Former. soldiers?
- More than that. They are professionals.

446
00:56:50,412 --> 00:56:55,625
- It's great.
- What foregr there?

447
00:56:55,751 --> 00:57:00,047
What are you entangled?

448
00:57:07,054 --> 00:57:11,808
Colin attempting
contact Weddos little brother.

449
00:57:11,933 --> 00:57:16,229
Those who are after Colin, finds him
first. Colin finds out.

450
00:57:16,355 --> 00:57:20,901
S he freak out and look
ndsaget to disappear.

451
00:57:21,026 --> 00:57:24,571
But without ID
get fairly close.

452
00:57:24,696 --> 00:57:27,741
S he contacts Sonny.
That they go also.

453
00:57:27,866 --> 00:57:32,412
How they found out
whom Colin had to contact?

454
00:57:32,537 --> 00:57:36,833
- They can see his interview lists.
- How?

455
00:57:36,958 --> 00:57:41,838
You said they are good. He committed
maybe a mistake when he kbte phone.

456
00:57:41,963 --> 00:57:46,218
The credit card he used,
or an alias, they've been addressed in.

457
00:57:46,343 --> 00:57:49,638
They found at least out of it.

458
00:57:49,763 --> 00:57:54,434
It took us from the Australian
p parking lot.

459
00:57:56,103 --> 00:58:01,942
Hvornr genbnede Rays? The club
've vret closed since the storm.

460

I worked with a murder opposite

461
00:58:07,948 --> 00:58:10,200
Wait a minute.

What you think of p,
No you hear my name?

463
00:58:17,541 --> 00:58:22,045
I thought of it enough. Was that why
you are not told about your son?

464
00:58:22,170 --> 00:58:26,008
Or whether that Renee had left you?

465
00:58:26,133 --> 00:58:32,431
I'm very sorry. I would
desire that I could have stttet you.

466
00:58:33,432 --> 00:58:40,647

467
00:58:40,772 --> 00:58:47,029
I never helped you.
I've never gengldt you.

00:58:47,154 --> 00:58:51,575
- Surrender yourself to me.
- Forget it, Sean.

00:58:51,700 --> 00:58:56,163
You can not save me this time.

A friend says she worked
as a dancer here last week.

484
01:00:22,749 --> 01:00:26,586
Did she? It was mrkeligt.

485
01:00:26,712 --> 01:00:30,757
As you see, we build on
and we have no employees.

486
01:00:30,882 --> 01:00:34,302
Is she in trouble?

487
01:00:35,971 --> 01:00:39,016
It may well say.

488
01:00:44,730 --> 01:00:49,359
You fr excuse me.
I have much to do.

489
01:00:49,484 --> 01:00:53,238
I know you're busy
with the renovation -

490
01:00:53,363 --> 01:00:57,617
- But I can tie her
to this nightclub.

491
01:00:58,535 --> 01:01:03,040
I Fri just my job.

Yes, and I seeks to make mine.
Enlarge you?

01:01:10,005 --> 01:01:14,468
Makes it something
if I give you a rd?

494
01:01:14,593 --> 01:01:22,100
If I were you, I'd VRE
very careful with this stuff.

I think I made them angry?

506
01:02:39,845 --> 01:02:44,016
Is it your plan to excite
assassins?

507
01:02:44,141 --> 01:02:48,895
Fine. I stand by.
I will be the grandfather sometime.

508
01:02:49,021 --> 01:02:55,235
Well, damn ...

01:03:30,687 --> 01:03:33,607

Colin, can you hear me?
That's me.

01:03:59,633 --> 01:04:02,761
Colin?

516
01:04:02,886 --> 01:04:04,805
Col?

517
01:04:08,850 --> 01:04:12,562
Rr you do not.
Do not blink once.

518
01:04:14,690 --> 01:04:18,944
Turn you on. Slowly.

519
01:04:19,069 --> 01:04:23,448
Colin, that's me.
What are you doing?

520
01:04:24,866 --> 01:04:28,662
- Who is he?
- My partner. Forget him.

522
01:04:34,501 --> 01:04:38,046
I thought you had grasped it.

I asked you the tray out.
Listening not, m you take flgerne.

524
01:04:46,596 --> 01:04:51,643
G to hell!
Everything here is your responsibility.

525
01:04:51,768 --> 01:04:56,440
- Will you arrest me?
- You're lucky if I do not do those things.

526
01:04:56,565 --> 01:04:59,985
They would love it. Ls me inside
in a cage and make it easy for them.

527
01:05:00,110 --> 01:05:05,782
- Who are you talking about?
- Dukkefreren that last trdene.

528
01:05:05,907 --> 01:05:10,787
These substances have hrget you
s you can not see clearly lngere.

529
01:05:10,912 --> 01:05:13,832
I just need ... Damn.

530
01:05:15,292 --> 01:05:18,795
I m just disappear from here.

531
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:22,424
If you do not shut me in,
I can not assist you.

532
01:05:24,468 --> 01:05:27,804
The company I work for -

533
01:05:27,929 --> 01:05:31,183
- Let me work hard for
a mysterious client based in LA.

534
01:05:32,684 --> 01:05:36,563
A loathsome task.

535
01:05:37,356 --> 01:05:42,027
It was totally crazy.
You can not imagine it.

536
01:05:44,279 --> 01:05:49,534
The last job knkkede me.

537
01:05:49,660 --> 01:05:56,792
The mysterious client would ensure
some interest in a war zone.

538
01:05:56,917 --> 01:06:02,464
It was not a dangerous operation,
and p. .. names.

539
01:06:02,589 --> 01:06:07,135
- What would the OPN with it?
- For God's sake!

540
01:06:07,260 --> 01:06:12,265
They do not want,
the war ends.

541
01:06:16,478 --> 01:06:22,859
Colin, what have you needle them?

542
01:06:22,985 --> 01:06:27,447
- What do you have?
- I have a videobnd.

543
01:06:29,491 --> 01:06:34,037
I stole it. I overvgnings-
Movies matches and interrogation.

544
01:06:34,162 --> 01:06:39,584
I have things that can be descending upon all
who have met with Spartan to do.

545
01:06:39,710 --> 01:06:44,381
Do away with it.
Lg it on the internet.

546
01:06:44,506 --> 01:06:48,885
Are you stupid in the head?
It is my only chance.

547
01:06:49,011 --> 01:06:53,557
That is my only security.
So I went to the journalist.

548
01:06:53,682 --> 01:06:59,438
He knew the one from the Justice Department,
which was to arrest me.

549
01:06:59,563 --> 01:07:06,862
It's just that you want
save yourself. You are skidedum.

550
01:07:06,987 --> 01:07:11,283
Do you know what you've done?
Do You Know?

551
01:07:11,408 --> 01:07:16,955
- I took a copy, if ...
- A lot of innocent people are dead.

552
01:07:17,080 --> 01:07:22,085
I have not forced anyone
for anything. Everyone knew the risks.

553
01:07:22,210 --> 01:07:27,174
Stacey did it?
The drbte her.

554
01:07:27,299 --> 01:07:31,303
The drbte your girl.
The brndte her alive.

555
01:07:31,428 --> 01:07:34,389
What the hell are you talking about?

556
01:07:38,602 --> 01:07:41,897
You're lying.

557
01:07:42,022 --> 01:07:46,193
Sean, you're lying about her!
She does not fail anything.

558
01:07:46,318 --> 01:07:48,904
You lie!

559
01:07:55,535 --> 01:08:00,290
Crowe is with p bndet, right?
He works for Spartan.

560
01:08:00,415 --> 01:08:04,169
Crowe is not with p bndet?

561
01:08:06,963 --> 01:08:13,387
How do you know that name?
Say where you saw and heard the name.

562
01:08:24,022 --> 01:08:26,525
Come on!

563
01:08:42,791 --> 01:08:45,460
Charger.

564
01:09:02,561 --> 01:09:05,397
Captured!

565
01:09:27,002 --> 01:09:29,838
There is a window in the cuisine behind me.

566
01:09:48,065 --> 01:09:51,401
Out the window all together.
Come on!

567
01:09:54,905 --> 01:09:58,533
Colin, what do we do?

568
01:10:03,538 --> 01:10:07,376

571
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:51,461
- I talked all about a reserve plan.

01:10:51,586 --> 01:10:56,466
Hurry s vk much as possible.

Where is videobndet?

574
01:11:53,899 --> 01:11:57,319
It's here.

575
01:12:50,956 --> 01:12:54,126
The explosion destroyed
house completely.

576
01:12:54,251 --> 01:12:57,671
The authorities have
No comments at the moment.

577
01:12:57,796 --> 01:13:02,175
Sources say there were soldiers
p spot fr brandvsenet arrived.

578
01:13:02,300 --> 01:13:04,845
We do not know
if there was anyone in the house.

579
01:13:04,970 --> 01:13:07,764
Police have spoken with neighbors -

580
01:13:07,889 --> 01:13:11,977
- To find out what happened

Yes, it was Colin's grandfather's house.

592

If they want korsfste me

01:17:40,620 --> 01:17:45,751

01:18:04,478 --> 01:18:10,442
- What do you mean?
- What do you think?

621
01:18:10,567 --> 01:18:14,363
You know why I'm here?

622
01:18:14,488 --> 01:18:17,991
Will you arrest me?

623
01:18:19,868 --> 01:18:25,707
- Let me finish this.
- I know how to end things.

624
01:18:28,377 --> 01:18:32,130
Do not you think
that pigs deserve it?

625
01:18:32,255 --> 01:18:39,554
It is precisely the case.
This is not the pipe piece.

626
01:18:42,766 --> 01:18:45,894
You are finished with this case.

627
01:19:11,920 --> 01:19:14,965
Do you remember me?

628
01:19:23,140 --> 01:19:29,146
Look at all this.
I'm impressed.

629
01:19:29,271 --> 01:19:32,858
This is Tora Bora, right?

630
01:19:37,738 --> 01:19:45,120
I vret with mr. Dekker
and Cole. They were inseparable.

631
01:19:45,245 --> 01:19:48,081
Can you remember the Cole?

632
01:19:51,168 --> 01:19:57,049
We found it here. Thank you.

633
01:19:57,174 --> 01:20:02,512
- I want to know if there are copies.
- Connector Bare yourself up!

634
01:20:04,222 --> 01:20:09,728
What a language. I got a glimpse
Your last mental status.

635
01:20:11,229 --> 01:20:15,359
I read that everything about you and your son.

636
01:20:15,484 --> 01:20:22,949
Terrible. Wrestled you still
with to visit his grave?

637
01:20:23,075 --> 01:20:27,871
I was actually stirred,
when I read that about it.

638
01:20:29,790 --> 01:20:33,126
I slr you fucking killed.

639
01:20:34,920 --> 01:20:37,005
All of you.

640
01:20:40,801 --> 01:20:45,681
We are wasting time here. I want to see if
Griff was more fortunate with the other.

641
01:21:02,030 --> 01:21:07,536
- He wake up. Beautiful knife.
- Fuck off.

642
01:21:12,874 --> 01:21:19,506
It is a sd boy.
It is he really.

643
01:21:20,799 --> 01:21:25,345
Or should I say "was".

644
01:21:25,470 --> 01:21:27,931
This m VRE old.

645
01:21:28,724 --> 01:21:32,477
Taken before becoming dull
and lost hret.

646
01:21:33,478 --> 01:21:39,609
Before the cancer d him up.
Grd him much?

647
01:21:41,194 --> 01:21:47,993
He did so safely.
He wept enough both day and night.

648
01:21:49,703 --> 01:21:52,289
- Yes.
- What?

649
01:21:55,125 --> 01:21:59,171
Yes, he wept constantly.

650
01:22:04,801 --> 01:22:08,639
You know why I was
s proud of him?

651
01:22:10,098 --> 01:22:13,143
He never begged for his life.

652
01:22:13,268 --> 01:22:19,066
Not once. That is more
than I can say about your friend Cole.

653
01:22:21,943 --> 01:22:25,739
A real tough guy.

654
01:22:25,864 --> 01:22:31,286
He begged for his life and pissed in
pants before I drbte him.

655
01:23:02,067 --> 01:23:04,486
Come on, you bastard.

656
01:24:06,715 --> 01:24:12,220
Hello? Is that you, Sean?
Where's Will?

657
01:24:12,346 --> 01:24:16,642

- Someone raided the place.

658
01:24:16,767 --> 01:24:19,770
- What happened?
- There has not been anything to him.

659
01:24:19,895 --> 01:24:24,524
- What happens? Here's blood.
- Nothing happens.

660
01:24:24,650 --> 01:24:29,529
Say the hell not sdan to me!
What happened to him?

01:25:22,207 --> 01:25:25,585
Baba Yaga was a witch.

She flj around on his broom and
looking for disobedient boys and girls.
