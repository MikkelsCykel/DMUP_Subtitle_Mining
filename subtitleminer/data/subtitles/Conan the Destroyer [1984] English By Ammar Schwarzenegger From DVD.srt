01:53:24,408 --> 01:53:27,707
Between the years when the oceans
drank Atlantis...

2
01:53:27,945 --> 01:53:30,743
...and the rise
of the Sons of Aryus...

3
01:53:30,981 --> 01:53:33,279
... there was an age undreamed of...

4
01:53:33,517 --> 01:53:37,317
...when shining kingdoms
lay spread across the world.

5
01:53:37,554 --> 01:53:41,650
Hither came Conan,
the Cimmerian, sword in hand.

6
01:53:41,892 --> 01:53:45,828
It is I, his chronicler,
who knows well his saga.

7
01:53:46,096 --> 01:53:50,499
Now, let me tell you
of the days of high adventure.

8
01:57:17,574 --> 01:57:20,873
-We angered the merchant.
-You're surprised?

9
01:57:21,278 --> 01:57:24,714
-We didn't steal all he had.
-We didn't have time.

10
01:58:19,669 --> 01:58:21,728
Why aren't they killing us?

11
01:58:21,938 --> 01:58:25,874
Maybe they want to capture us
and torture us to death.

12
01:59:04,881 --> 01:59:06,576
Conan, help!

13
02:00:36,940 --> 02:00:39,431
-Do you know who l am?
-Taramis.

14
02:00:39,910 --> 02:00:42,811
-Queen Taramis.
-Not my queen.

15
02:00:43,380 --> 02:00:46,941
You have a queen?
But you are a Cimmerian.

16
02:00:47,384 --> 02:00:49,545
Cimmerians have no rulers.

17
02:00:49,786 --> 02:00:52,550
You're a barbarian. You live free.

18
02:00:52,789 --> 02:00:56,316
You owe allegiance to no one.
ls that not so?

19
02:00:56,593 --> 02:00:58,527
lt is and it always will be.

20
02:00:58,962 --> 02:01:01,396
-What do you want?
-l need your help.

21
02:01:01,865 --> 02:01:03,492
-No!
-No?

22
02:01:03,967 --> 02:01:08,461
-You don't know what l'd give you.
-You have nothing that l want.

23
02:01:11,474 --> 02:01:15,308
You were praying, Conan.
What were you praying for?

24
02:01:19,683 --> 02:01:21,480
Look at the shrine.

25
02:01:22,819 --> 02:01:25,287
See what you were praying for.

26
02:01:27,457 --> 02:01:29,448
What is there, Conan?

27
02:01:30,293 --> 02:01:31,419
Think.

28
02:01:36,766 --> 02:01:40,634
Show me the desire
in your deepest heart.

29
02:02:05,462 --> 02:02:06,724
Valeria.

30
02:02:07,464 --> 02:02:09,364
Where is this Valeria?

31
02:02:09,799 --> 02:02:13,291
-With Crom.
-Your god?

32
02:02:13,503 --> 02:02:15,801
She sits by the side of my god.

33
02:02:19,576 --> 02:02:22,602
What l want, you cannot give me.

34
02:02:23,647 --> 02:02:24,614
Yes, l can.

35
02:02:25,515 --> 02:02:29,781
-You can bring back the dead?
-Do as l ask of you...

36
02:02:30,020 --> 02:02:31,544
...and l will.

37
02:02:34,891 --> 02:02:36,324
Wake.

38
02:02:41,097 --> 02:02:42,462
And remember.

39
02:02:43,066 --> 02:02:45,000
Tell me what l must do.

40
02:02:46,369 --> 02:02:47,768
Soon.

41
02:03:27,444 --> 02:03:29,105
-Conan!
-Look!

42
02:04:02,879 --> 02:04:05,439
Doesn't that animal look familiar?

43
02:04:07,917 --> 02:04:12,547
l think it does. l'm sorry about
what happened the last time.

44
02:04:25,969 --> 02:04:27,459
They love us.

45
02:05:26,996 --> 02:05:28,657
We will drink to Dagoth...

46
02:05:29,399 --> 02:05:31,367
...the Dreaming God.

47
02:05:36,473 --> 02:05:40,569
-What do you want me to do?
-To bring back the woman you love?

48
02:05:40,910 --> 02:05:42,343
Yes.

49
02:05:45,448 --> 02:05:48,679
lt is written
in the Scrolls of Skelos...

50
02:05:48,885 --> 02:05:52,912
...that a girl born with a mark
must make a perilous journey.

51
02:05:53,156 --> 02:05:54,987
lt is her destiny.

52
02:05:58,962 --> 02:06:01,726
My niece, Jehnna, has such a mark.

53
02:06:02,632 --> 02:06:05,863
-You will take her on that journey.
-To where?

54
02:06:06,402 --> 02:06:08,302
Jehnna will show you.

55
02:06:10,073 --> 02:06:13,770
Ever since she was born
she's been prepared for this.

56
02:06:14,544 --> 02:06:19,072
There is a key she must find,
a key only she can touch...

57
02:06:19,616 --> 02:06:23,052
...as it was written
in the Scrolls of Skelos.

58
02:06:23,853 --> 02:06:27,118
-Where is it?
-ln a castle.

59
02:06:27,724 --> 02:06:31,626
-Guarded?
-By a wizard called Toth-Amon.

60
02:06:31,995 --> 02:06:35,089
-By a wizard?
-That frightens you.

61
02:06:35,832 --> 02:06:37,493
You're afraid of magic.

62
02:06:39,035 --> 02:06:41,560
And you will have to deal with it.

63
02:06:43,039 --> 02:06:45,633
What good is a sword against sorcery?

64
02:06:45,875 --> 02:06:50,471
-Then you're afraid to go?
-No. l will find a way.

65
02:06:51,114 --> 02:06:53,139
What does this key unlock?

66
02:06:53,516 --> 02:06:55,006
A treasure.

67
02:06:58,821 --> 02:07:02,382
A jeweled horn.
Only she can procure it.

68
02:07:03,092 --> 02:07:05,560
Only she can lead you to it.

69
02:07:07,830 --> 02:07:12,096
And when she has it,
you'll bring her back to me.

70
02:07:12,802 --> 02:07:14,963
Then you will have your reward.

71
02:07:18,541 --> 02:07:21,305
We shall both have everything we want.

72
02:07:22,045 --> 02:07:23,103
Through magic.

73
02:07:28,418 --> 02:07:31,046
lt's all right. Don't be afraid.

74
02:07:31,421 --> 02:07:34,754
-lt's only a dream. Only a dream.
-No, l saw--

75
02:07:34,958 --> 02:07:38,325
-A dream. lt was only a dream.
-l saw--

76
02:07:38,528 --> 02:07:42,055
-Be still. Lie down.
-l saw it!

77
02:07:42,432 --> 02:07:43,990
-No--
-l saw it again!

78
02:07:44,367 --> 02:07:48,030
-You saw nothing! A nightmare.
-l did! l did!

79
02:07:48,404 --> 02:07:52,465
-Go back to sleep.
-l saw it again.

80
02:07:53,443 --> 02:07:56,776
l saw it! l did, l saw it.

81
02:07:57,614 --> 02:08:01,744
Tomorrow, you start your journey.
You need all your strength.

82
02:08:01,951 --> 02:08:03,680
Your destiny's at hand.

83
02:08:04,687 --> 02:08:07,315
Now, sleep.

84
02:08:10,560 --> 02:08:11,720
Sleep.

85
02:08:13,630 --> 02:08:17,896
All our destinies are at hand.
Even Conan's. He doesn't know it.

86
02:08:18,835 --> 02:08:20,427
We don't need him.

87
02:08:20,837 --> 02:08:25,934
l don't need the captain of the guard
to steal a key. l need a thief.

88
02:08:26,175 --> 02:08:29,736
What you need to do
is make sure this dear child...

89
02:08:29,979 --> 02:08:31,947
...returns safely to the palace...

90
02:08:32,181 --> 02:08:35,810
...with both the treasure
and her virginity intact.

91
02:08:36,185 --> 02:08:37,914
l will protect them both.

92
02:08:40,523 --> 02:08:42,514
You better, my friend...

93
02:08:43,092 --> 02:08:47,995
...for she must be a virgin when she's
returned to be properly sacrificed.

94
02:08:53,503 --> 02:08:55,471
One other thing, Bombaata.

95
02:08:55,705 --> 02:08:59,004
We can't have the King of Thieves
near the treasure.

96
02:08:59,375 --> 02:09:03,277
So when the key is
in my niece's hand, kill Conan.

97
02:09:03,880 --> 02:09:07,475
Have the Elite Guard follow.
They will help you.

98
02:09:07,950 --> 02:09:09,679
Conan must die.

99
02:09:19,595 --> 02:09:21,586
Do you think he's handsome?

100
02:09:23,566 --> 02:09:24,794
Very ugly.

101
02:09:26,002 --> 02:09:29,096
No, not him. Conan.

102
02:09:31,607 --> 02:09:36,010
-Can't you judge for yourself?
-But how can l?

103
02:09:36,612 --> 02:09:40,912
How many times have l seen a man?
A real man.

104
02:09:42,118 --> 02:09:44,143
All l've seen is you.

105
02:09:48,825 --> 02:09:51,419
Meaning no insult to you, Bombaata.

106
02:09:52,128 --> 02:09:55,120
Yes, he is handsome.

107
02:10:34,537 --> 02:10:37,631
Conan, wait! We must go this way.

108
02:10:37,940 --> 02:10:40,932
-Not yet.
-But you have to obey me.

109
02:10:41,744 --> 02:10:45,077
Weren't you told?
There are rules to every game.

110
02:10:45,748 --> 02:10:50,913
But there's magic in this game.
l'll have to fight it with magic.

111
02:10:51,654 --> 02:10:52,586
Akiro.

112
02:11:30,760 --> 02:11:33,558
-What are they going to do?
-Have lunch.

113
02:11:52,782 --> 02:11:56,479
Those savages would
have a terrible stomach ache.

114
02:11:56,686 --> 02:12:00,019
Why would they eat someone
so old and sour as you?

115
02:12:00,623 --> 02:12:04,753
They thought if they ate me,
my magic would be in their blood.

116
02:12:04,961 --> 02:12:07,725
At least they could've
washed you first.

117
02:12:30,019 --> 02:12:31,008
l need you.

118
02:12:31,654 --> 02:12:33,087
l'm yours.

119
02:12:42,765 --> 02:12:46,861
-Tell me more about this key.
-Oh, it's not an ordinary key.

120
02:12:47,403 --> 02:12:49,166
-lt's a jewel.
-A jewel?

121
02:12:49,538 --> 02:12:52,701
Yes. The Heart of Ahriman.

122
02:12:54,143 --> 02:12:55,974
Well, can it be worn?

123
02:12:56,178 --> 02:12:59,579
Only by me. No one else dare touch it.

124
02:13:59,842 --> 02:14:03,744
lf there is anything you like here,
try not to take it.

125
02:14:03,946 --> 02:14:07,814
l know when to steal and when not to.

126
02:14:34,977 --> 02:14:37,946
-Get her. Get her!
-What did she do?

127
02:14:38,147 --> 02:14:39,978
She came with the bandits.

128
02:14:40,182 --> 02:14:45,518
The others are dead. Now it's
her turn. After we have our fun.

129
02:14:46,889 --> 02:14:48,948
Don't kill her too soon.

130
02:14:49,225 --> 02:14:50,954
Save her!

131
02:14:51,227 --> 02:14:53,957
Thieves should be hanged.

132
02:14:56,932 --> 02:15:00,800
Conan, there are six
of them against her.

133
02:15:01,203 --> 02:15:04,969
One, two, three....
l think you're right.

134
02:15:05,174 --> 02:15:09,804
And she's tied to the stake!
Do something!

135
02:17:32,521 --> 02:17:33,749
Stop!

136
02:17:44,700 --> 02:17:48,602
-l think we made a friend.
-Wait here.

137
02:18:08,958 --> 02:18:10,585
What do you want?

138
02:18:11,193 --> 02:18:13,388
-To come with you.
-Be off!

139
02:18:15,764 --> 02:18:17,493
Let me speak to Conan.

140
02:18:17,967 --> 02:18:19,958
l said, be off!

141
02:19:30,472 --> 02:19:31,564
Stop!

142
02:19:37,012 --> 02:19:38,479
Leave.

143
02:19:40,249 --> 02:19:45,152
l swear that if Conan let me ride
with him, l will give my life for him.

144
02:19:50,726 --> 02:19:51,715
We shall see.

145
02:20:30,099 --> 02:20:34,229
The castle of Toth-Amon.
lt holds the key.

146
02:20:49,752 --> 02:20:51,879
Come bring her, Conan.

147
02:20:55,524 --> 02:20:58,186
-We leave now.
-ln the morning.

148
02:21:00,829 --> 02:21:04,993
-l'm the leader.
-Lead in the morning. lt'll be better.

149
02:21:05,200 --> 02:21:09,034
-We must rest.
-My thinking exactly.

150
02:23:10,192 --> 02:23:11,716
Sleep.

151
02:23:14,796 --> 02:23:18,129
ln the morning you'll touch
The Heart of Ahriman.

152
02:23:18,834 --> 02:23:21,997
The first to do so
in 1 000 years.

153
02:23:50,999 --> 02:23:52,159
Look!

154
02:23:58,006 --> 02:23:59,268
Jehnna?

155
02:24:13,555 --> 02:24:15,750
Akiro, where is she?

156
02:24:19,962 --> 02:24:20,894
ln there!

157
02:24:24,600 --> 02:24:29,560
-Who took her?
-A giant bird. A bird of smoke.

158
02:24:32,841 --> 02:24:33,933
lnto the boat!

159
02:24:36,011 --> 02:24:38,980
-Somebody should watch the horses.
-Malak!

160
02:24:40,782 --> 02:24:42,613
l didn't mean me!

161
02:24:45,921 --> 02:24:47,548
l'm rowing!

162
02:25:18,086 --> 02:25:19,781
Too late, my friends.

163
02:25:21,657 --> 02:25:22,954
But come.

164
02:25:23,925 --> 02:25:25,756
Come anyway.

165
02:26:20,749 --> 02:26:24,617
How do we get in?
ls there another entrance?

166
02:26:35,831 --> 02:26:38,265
Under here is a way in.

167
02:26:39,067 --> 02:26:41,001
You mean under the water?

168
02:26:41,636 --> 02:26:43,831
You can stay here if you like.

169
02:26:46,875 --> 02:26:48,570
Alone?

170
02:27:10,332 --> 02:27:11,560
They need me!

171
02:29:16,791 --> 02:29:19,021
-Be careful.
-Oh, hold on!

172
02:29:44,286 --> 02:29:45,844
Bombaata.

173
02:31:34,329 --> 02:31:36,126
Wizard it open.

174
02:32:03,258 --> 02:32:07,126
Fine magician you are.
Go back to juggling apples.

175
02:33:08,690 --> 02:33:10,658
Get up! Get him!

176
02:35:42,977 --> 02:35:45,605
That's exactly what l'd have done.

177
02:36:30,758 --> 02:36:34,785
There are two left, Wizard,
and you're behind one of them.

178
02:36:36,364 --> 02:36:38,059
Which one?

179
02:36:39,167 --> 02:36:42,364
-No! Not here!
-Not this one!

180
02:38:01,015 --> 02:38:02,312
l need you!

181
02:38:08,923 --> 02:38:10,322
lt's all right.

182
02:39:08,850 --> 02:39:10,249
Crom!

183
02:39:30,972 --> 02:39:33,634
Out! Out of here!

184
02:39:33,841 --> 02:39:35,206
Hurry! Hurry!

185
02:40:45,680 --> 02:40:47,739
All an illusion.

186
02:41:23,618 --> 02:41:24,607
Help!

187
02:41:25,186 --> 02:41:30,021
Bombaata! Help me!
Bombaata, where are you?

188
02:41:30,291 --> 02:41:33,192
Put me down! Do you hear me?
Put me down!

189
02:41:34,362 --> 02:41:35,989
Look out, you fool!

190
02:44:37,978 --> 02:44:39,104
Bombaata, stop!

191
02:44:42,883 --> 02:44:43,850
Why?

192
02:44:44,385 --> 02:44:47,013
l thought you were going to hurt her.

193
02:44:57,798 --> 02:45:00,232
This is one of the queen's guards.

194
02:45:00,434 --> 02:45:04,165
-Why did they attack us?
-Not by her order.

195
02:45:48,282 --> 02:45:51,012
Wait, wait. This is much better.

196
02:45:51,218 --> 02:45:55,882
Akiro's own magic mixture.
Let me help you.

197
02:46:21,782 --> 02:46:26,048
-What do you think you're doing?
-Covering your wound.

198
02:46:26,287 --> 02:46:28,346
My wound is lower.

199
02:46:28,756 --> 02:46:31,691
We don't want an infection to spread.

200
02:46:31,892 --> 02:46:34,884
l'll spread your head open.

201
02:46:39,199 --> 02:46:41,759
This is what the world has come to.

202
02:46:42,436 --> 02:46:44,404
You try to help somebody...

203
02:46:44,805 --> 02:46:47,797
...and what do you get
instead of thanks?

204
02:46:49,009 --> 02:46:50,374
Threats.

205
02:47:02,089 --> 02:47:04,216
Now yell if it hurts.

206
02:47:11,732 --> 02:47:13,996
l suppose nothing hurts you.

207
02:47:14,201 --> 02:47:15,429
Only pain.

208
02:47:17,805 --> 02:47:20,103
After we return to Shadizar...

209
02:47:21,141 --> 02:47:22,972
...what will you do?

210
02:47:23,377 --> 02:47:28,474
l'll find my kingdom
and a queen to sit beside me.

211
02:47:32,086 --> 02:47:33,747
What kingdom?

212
02:47:34,321 --> 02:47:37,154
The promise l was kingdomed.

213
02:47:39,827 --> 02:47:43,263
The kingdom l was promised.

214
02:47:49,236 --> 02:47:50,430
What queen?

215
02:47:51,271 --> 02:47:52,329
Valeria.

216
02:48:01,715 --> 02:48:05,947
What is she like, this Valeria?

217
02:48:09,189 --> 02:48:11,817
Do you see this woman over there?

218
02:48:14,461 --> 02:48:17,760
-Zula?
-Valeria is like her.

219
02:48:18,732 --> 02:48:20,757
She doesn't look like her...

220
02:48:21,502 --> 02:48:24,733
...but she has the same spirit.

221
02:48:26,140 --> 02:48:27,767
The same....

222
02:48:28,709 --> 02:48:30,370
The same....

223
02:48:31,078 --> 02:48:32,045
Strengths?

224
02:48:34,281 --> 02:48:35,942
Strength.

225
02:48:36,850 --> 02:48:38,909
And she's a warrior too?

226
02:48:39,119 --> 02:48:41,087
A great warrior.

227
02:48:42,956 --> 02:48:44,082
A great woman.

228
02:48:45,159 --> 02:48:46,990
Could there ever be...

229
02:48:47,861 --> 02:48:50,762
...anyone else but her?

230
02:48:50,964 --> 02:48:52,989
Another queen?

231
02:48:53,834 --> 02:48:55,199
Lot on your knife.

232
02:48:58,172 --> 02:49:00,936
Not on your life.

233
02:49:06,713 --> 02:49:08,112
Excuse me.

234
02:49:09,049 --> 02:49:10,983
l must get up now.

235
02:49:30,170 --> 02:49:31,865
How do you feel?

236
02:49:33,173 --> 02:49:34,333
Welcome.

237
02:49:36,210 --> 02:49:38,110
You are welcome.

238
02:49:41,048 --> 02:49:43,710
l didn't know women could be warriors.

239
02:49:43,951 --> 02:49:46,215
All my tribe are warriors.

240
02:49:48,422 --> 02:49:51,391
lt seems that men like women warriors.

241
02:49:51,792 --> 02:49:52,781
Some.

242
02:49:55,796 --> 02:49:57,889
Think l could ever be one?

243
02:50:00,067 --> 02:50:03,002
l could teach you how to use this.

244
02:50:06,740 --> 02:50:07,672
Please.

245
02:50:11,712 --> 02:50:14,237
Now, the power is in the wrists.

246
02:50:14,515 --> 02:50:15,914
Oh, l see.

247
02:50:16,116 --> 02:50:18,050
-Like this?
-That's right.

248
02:50:18,285 --> 02:50:20,685
They've got to stay loose.

249
02:50:21,121 --> 02:50:24,090
lt takes practice and strength.

250
02:50:25,092 --> 02:50:26,286
Wait!

251
02:50:30,764 --> 02:50:32,163
Hold on.

252
02:50:33,867 --> 02:50:38,133
lf you're gonna learn to fight,
then learn with a real weapon.

253
02:50:38,805 --> 02:50:40,397
Not with a toothpick.

254
02:50:42,309 --> 02:50:44,903
Here, l'll show you.

255
02:50:45,112 --> 02:50:47,239
Stand like this.

256
02:50:51,985 --> 02:50:53,418
You do it. Try it.

257
02:50:53,787 --> 02:50:56,255
And then swing it over your head.

258
02:50:57,824 --> 02:51:00,190
l'll help you. Swing over your head.

259
02:51:02,429 --> 02:51:03,657
Good.

260
02:51:06,099 --> 02:51:09,068
Now you're ready to take on anybody.

261
02:51:34,061 --> 02:51:36,188
How do you attract a man?

262
02:51:37,931 --> 02:51:39,728
What l mean is...

263
02:51:40,033 --> 02:51:43,196
...suppose you set your heart
on somebody.

264
02:51:44,338 --> 02:51:47,796
-What would you do to get him?
-Grab him.

265
02:51:48,442 --> 02:51:50,137
And take him!

266
02:51:50,344 --> 02:51:53,871
You'd grab him and take him?

267
02:51:54,081 --> 02:51:55,878
Take him!

268
02:51:56,216 --> 02:51:57,342
Like that!

269
02:52:05,726 --> 02:52:08,695
-What did she mean?
-What did she say?

270
02:52:08,895 --> 02:52:12,456
Well, she said
that if she wanted a man...

271
02:52:12,833 --> 02:52:15,358
...she'd reach out and take him.

272
02:52:15,769 --> 02:52:17,327
Good idea.

273
02:52:18,138 --> 02:52:19,833
But then what?

274
02:52:20,040 --> 02:52:23,669
l mean, you've got him.
What do you do with him?

275
02:52:24,378 --> 02:52:27,438
That's easy. You see, you just--

276
02:52:28,282 --> 02:52:29,749
You....

277
02:52:31,285 --> 02:52:35,779
You see, in order for a man
to really know a woman...

278
02:52:37,257 --> 02:52:41,318
...and for her to know him,
they have to....

279
02:52:42,362 --> 02:52:44,956
They have to join.

280
02:52:46,500 --> 02:52:48,024
Join?

281
02:52:52,472 --> 02:52:53,496
Get together.

282
02:52:56,443 --> 02:52:58,377
He has to take his...

283
02:53:01,882 --> 02:53:03,816
...incredible by the--

284
02:53:06,353 --> 02:53:08,446
There you are, joined.

285
02:53:08,822 --> 02:53:11,791
l mean, how do you think flowers grow?

286
02:53:20,567 --> 02:53:21,534
Through this?

287
02:53:23,937 --> 02:53:25,928
ls this the only way?

288
02:53:27,407 --> 02:53:31,503
-We can't go around it?
-l go where l feel myself led.

289
02:53:31,912 --> 02:53:33,436
So l've noticed.

290
02:55:31,364 --> 02:55:33,229
That way.

291
02:57:01,454 --> 02:57:05,015
Shouldn't one of us go back
and stand guard?

292
02:57:58,278 --> 02:57:59,768
Together.

293
02:58:35,348 --> 02:58:37,578
Here, let me help.

294
02:58:40,420 --> 02:58:43,446
Malak, go inside
and see if there's a lock.

295
02:58:44,124 --> 02:58:46,354
-You mean in there?
-Go!

296
02:59:04,477 --> 02:59:06,104
l found something.

297
02:59:06,312 --> 02:59:08,507
Let go. Easy.

298
03:00:27,260 --> 03:00:31,492
''lt is written
in the Scrolls of Skelos...

299
03:00:31,865 --> 03:00:36,825
...that the horn will be found
by a woman-child.

300
03:00:37,036 --> 03:00:41,996
A virgin who will have
a mark upon her.

301
03:00:54,254 --> 03:00:57,519
And when the horn
is placed once more...

302
03:00:57,857 --> 03:01:02,385
...in the forehead
of the Dreaming God...

303
03:01:03,463 --> 03:01:05,897
...Dagoth will arise.

304
03:01:06,132 --> 03:01:09,431
Then let man fear...

305
03:01:10,436 --> 03:01:12,927
...death to the world.

306
03:01:16,476 --> 03:01:19,001
The woman-child will be sacrificed.''

307
03:01:58,184 --> 03:02:01,244
-Stop her! Don't let--
-Be silent!

308
03:02:38,625 --> 03:02:40,217
Crom!

309
03:03:50,063 --> 03:03:52,031
''Death to the world.''

310
03:03:52,465 --> 03:03:54,023
Life for Valeria.

311
03:04:00,606 --> 03:04:05,976
-Her destiny isn't only to deliver it.
-lt's just writing on a wall.

312
03:04:06,179 --> 03:04:08,943
She is to be killed! Sacrificed!

313
03:04:09,649 --> 03:04:10,616
We shall see.

314
03:04:11,985 --> 03:04:14,112
Destiny or not.

315
03:04:15,254 --> 03:04:17,154
Everybody out!

316
03:04:17,857 --> 03:04:18,915
Out!

317
03:04:21,227 --> 03:04:24,094
Wait! lt's worth a fortune!

318
03:05:02,068 --> 03:05:03,467
We come in peace.

319
03:05:03,669 --> 03:05:06,160
Then let us go in peace.

320
03:05:07,340 --> 03:05:12,073
Let the girl come forward.
We've waited for her all our lives.

321
03:05:13,346 --> 03:05:17,305
We are the keepers of the horn.
lt belongs to us.

322
03:05:18,151 --> 03:05:19,618
No longer.

323
03:05:20,086 --> 03:05:22,179
-Who are you?
-Conan.

324
03:05:22,422 --> 03:05:24,014
l have heard of you.

325
03:05:33,399 --> 03:05:36,425
You know the legend
written on the crypt wall?

326
03:05:36,669 --> 03:05:38,432
From the day of my birth.

327
03:05:38,671 --> 03:05:40,502
Then you know what happens...

328
03:05:40,706 --> 03:05:44,608
...if the horn is placed back
in the forehead of Dagoth.

329
03:05:45,378 --> 03:05:47,471
The god will live again.

330
03:05:47,713 --> 03:05:51,149
And we who give him life
will stand by his side...

331
03:05:51,384 --> 03:05:53,614
...and rule the world with him.

332
03:05:53,986 --> 03:05:58,013
You'll die in the great evil
that will come from his rebirth!

333
03:05:58,224 --> 03:06:02,320
-We will control him.
-No one is able to control him!

334
03:06:02,528 --> 03:06:05,861
His power and his evil are too great!

335
03:06:06,065 --> 03:06:08,397
Give us the girl or we'll take her!

336
03:06:08,601 --> 03:06:09,568
Enough talk!

337
03:06:40,967 --> 03:06:42,298
Back to the crypt!

338
03:07:33,486 --> 03:07:35,511
Bombaata, get out!

339
03:07:37,023 --> 03:07:39,651
Out! Let's get out of here!

340
03:08:14,894 --> 03:08:18,625
Behind the dragon is a tunnel.
lt's our only way out.

341
03:08:18,998 --> 03:08:21,023
The jewel! Take the jewel!

342
03:08:22,034 --> 03:08:23,831
Hurry, hurry.

343
03:08:28,507 --> 03:08:30,065
That way.

344
03:08:36,048 --> 03:08:36,980
Malak!

345
03:08:38,985 --> 03:08:40,145
Come on!

346
03:09:18,257 --> 03:09:21,192
lt's the leader. He's a wizard.

347
03:09:30,536 --> 03:09:32,470
He's forcing the mouth open.

348
03:09:32,672 --> 03:09:35,436
Well, stop him! Kill him or something.

349
03:09:37,076 --> 03:09:42,275
-My dagger's gone. You kill him.
-lt's bad luck to kill a wizard.

350
03:09:42,481 --> 03:09:46,611
Wait. There's a better way
to take care of a wizard.

351
03:10:20,553 --> 03:10:22,384
Well done, Akiro.

352
03:10:23,956 --> 03:10:25,856
lnto the tunnel.

353
03:10:41,107 --> 03:10:44,099
Don't stop! Hurry! Hurry!

354
03:12:29,315 --> 03:12:31,215
Run! Run!

355
03:12:38,724 --> 03:12:42,216
-Where are the others?
-They're coming. Don't worry.

356
03:13:21,400 --> 03:13:23,960
-They've gone.
-Taken their horses.

357
03:13:24,169 --> 03:13:27,570
-Or been captured. Let's flee.
-Wait.

358
03:13:28,741 --> 03:13:30,641
Bombaata took her.

359
03:13:33,112 --> 03:13:35,672
Taramis planned it from the beginning.

360
03:13:36,048 --> 03:13:39,745
We get the horn,
her guards will kill us.

361
03:13:40,152 --> 03:13:42,950
Bombaata takes them both back to her.

362
03:13:43,489 --> 03:13:45,548
And her promise to you?

363
03:13:46,158 --> 03:13:47,750
A lie.

364
03:13:54,500 --> 03:13:57,560
-Where are we going?
-To Shadizar!

365
03:13:58,470 --> 03:14:01,337
-What for?
-To stop Jehnna's sacrifice.

366
03:14:01,540 --> 03:14:04,998
But it's her destiny.
lt can't be stopped.

367
03:14:05,511 --> 03:14:07,342
You don't have to come.

368
03:14:07,546 --> 03:14:08,672
-l will.
-l will.

369
03:14:09,081 --> 03:14:10,548
l won't!

370
03:14:10,749 --> 03:14:13,479
l mean, what's in it for us?

371
03:14:14,420 --> 03:14:18,151
We're not some charitable
institution! We're thieves!

372
03:14:18,624 --> 03:14:21,650
Go! l won't help!

373
03:14:34,073 --> 03:14:35,597
Hey, wait for me!

374
03:14:35,975 --> 03:14:38,466
You know you can't do without me.

375
03:14:38,677 --> 03:14:41,043
Wait, Conan, wait!

376
03:15:02,368 --> 03:15:04,427
Do you have the treasure?

377
03:15:17,149 --> 03:15:18,480
Bring it to me.

378
03:15:38,137 --> 03:15:40,162
Reserves, to guard the palace.

379
03:15:40,406 --> 03:15:44,172
There must be hundreds.
We can't get in there.

380
03:15:44,376 --> 03:15:47,243
Well, you can't say we didn't try.

381
03:15:48,013 --> 03:15:52,507
-The front can't be the only entrance.
-Oh, it isn't--

382
03:16:05,330 --> 03:16:08,322
Behind the waterfall
there's an entrance.

383
03:16:08,567 --> 03:16:12,435
My cousin's sister's brother
dug his way out there...

384
03:16:12,638 --> 03:16:15,903
...when he was a prisoner of Shadizar.

385
03:16:37,763 --> 03:16:39,492
Today is your birthday.

386
03:16:39,698 --> 03:16:42,292
All of Shadizar is celebrating.

387
03:16:43,535 --> 03:16:44,467
Drink.

388
03:16:50,175 --> 03:16:52,666
To life. To Dagoth.

389
03:16:53,679 --> 03:16:55,340
To Dagoth.

390
03:17:29,281 --> 03:17:31,044
Oh, Dagoth.

391
03:17:31,250 --> 03:17:32,615
God of gods.

392
03:17:41,660 --> 03:17:45,596
My cousin's sister's brother
never mentioned bars.

393
03:17:45,798 --> 03:17:47,459
How do we get back up?

394
03:17:47,666 --> 03:17:51,762
They were put up after your
sister's brother's cousin escaped.

395
03:17:52,137 --> 03:17:55,664
Cousin's sister's brother!
l keep telling you!

396
03:17:56,041 --> 03:17:57,508
You said your sister's--

397
03:17:57,709 --> 03:18:01,042
Who cares whose
brother's sister's cousin it is!

398
03:18:01,246 --> 03:18:04,079
What difference does it make?!

399
03:18:29,608 --> 03:18:34,307
At the first sign of life in our god,
the girl must be sacrificed.

400
03:18:34,513 --> 03:18:39,644
Or as the Scrolls of Skelos say,
''A catastrophe will befall us.''

401
03:19:25,130 --> 03:19:28,622
Oh, Dagoth, God of gods...

402
03:19:29,001 --> 03:19:32,300
...power above all power.

403
03:21:21,613 --> 03:21:23,205
Kill her!

404
03:21:25,584 --> 03:21:26,551
Save the girl!

405
03:22:14,199 --> 03:22:17,396
Kill her! Kill her!
She must be sacrificed!

406
03:23:17,395 --> 03:23:18,487
Get back!

407
03:23:40,519 --> 03:23:42,544
Down the steps!

408
03:24:43,782 --> 03:24:45,249
Run!

409
03:25:25,323 --> 03:25:29,555
His horn is his life!
Tear out the horn!

410
03:27:41,292 --> 03:27:42,224
Zula?

411
03:27:55,106 --> 03:27:59,634
l need a captain of the guards.
l see no reason why a woman...

412
03:28:00,044 --> 03:28:02,274
...wouldn't do as well as a man.

413
03:28:18,430 --> 03:28:19,362
You!

414
03:28:20,131 --> 03:28:21,359
Me?

415
03:28:21,633 --> 03:28:22,725
Come here.

416
03:28:29,774 --> 03:28:33,175
l understand that every queen
must have a fool.

417
03:28:36,748 --> 03:28:40,184
-Do l qualify?
-More than qualify.

418
03:28:51,896 --> 03:28:55,730
Will the world's greatest wizard
come forward, please?

419
03:29:00,438 --> 03:29:01,735
At your service.

420
03:29:04,642 --> 03:29:06,667
One can't rule without wisdom.

421
03:29:07,645 --> 03:29:11,137
-Let me instruct you in the mystical--
-Later.

422
03:29:43,214 --> 03:29:45,182
Rule Shadizar with me.

423
03:29:45,850 --> 03:29:49,479
l will have my own kingdom,
my own queen.

424
03:30:34,666 --> 03:30:39,069
So it was that Conan
mourned his lost Valeria.

425
03:30:39,470 --> 03:30:42,803
At length he sought adventure
in distant lands...

426
03:30:43,174 --> 03:30:45,608
...and trod the jeweled thrones...

427
03:30:45,843 --> 03:30:48,641
...beneath his sandaled feet.

428
03:30:48,880 --> 03:30:53,317
Until at last,
he found his own kingdom...

429
03:30:53,518 --> 03:30:57,079
...and wore his crown
upon a troubled brow.

430
03:30:58,079 --> 03:31:08,079
