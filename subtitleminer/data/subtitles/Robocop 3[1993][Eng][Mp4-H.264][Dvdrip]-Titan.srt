<i>Imagine an end to crime...</i>

2
00:00:42,189 --> 00:00:44,350
<i>...an end to poverty.</i>

3
00:00:44,758 --> 00:00:50,094
<i>Imagine 2 million good jobs
waiting to be filled.</i>

4
00:00:50,497 --> 00:00:53,330
<i>Sounds like a dream, doesn't it?</i>

5
00:00:54,134 --> 00:00:58,537
<i>Well, sometimes dreams come true.</i>

6
00:00:58,772 --> 00:01:00,467
<i>Delta City.</i>

7
00:01:00,841 --> 00:01:02,775
<i>For our children.</i>

<i>Good evening, I'm Casey Wong.
Our top story tonight:</i>

10
00:01:17,391 --> 00:01:21,384
<i>Motor City goes Japanese as the
Omni Consumer Products Corporation...</i>

11
00:01:21,562 --> 00:01:25,157
<i>...ended months of speculation today
by announcing its takeover...</i>

12
00:01:25,365 --> 00:01:28,630
<i>...by the multinational
Kanemitsu Corporation.</i>

13
00:01:28,802 --> 00:01:32,863
Come on, honey, hurry up with your
calculus. It's almost time for bed.

14
00:01:33,807 --> 00:01:35,866
I'm watching Media Break.

15
00:01:36,176 --> 00:01:39,668
<i>- the first private corporation
to completely own and operate a major city.</i>

16
00:01:39,846 --> 00:01:42,246
<i>Company spokesmen
express special interest...</i>

17
00:01:42,382 --> 00:01:44,475
<i>...in the issues of urban resettlement...</i>

18
00:01:44,651 --> 00:01:49,748
<i>...and a crime wave in Detroit that
many citizens are calling a war zone.</i>

19
00:01:53,327 --> 00:01:55,522
<i>But as usual, OCP has an answer.</i>

20
00:01:56,263 --> 00:01:59,824
<i>Meet the Rehabs, Urban
rehabilitation officers.</i>

21
00:02:00,167 --> 00:02:02,328
<i>From the blazing fields
of the Amazon War...</i>

22
00:02:02,502 --> 00:02:05,733
<i>...comes state-of-the-art
urban pacification.</i>

23
00:02:06,073 --> 00:02:10,772
<i>We're here to help the people, augment the
police force and deal with the gang problem.</i>

24
00:02:11,111 --> 00:02:13,602
<i>What about reports you're
actually evicting people...</i>

25
00:02:13,814 --> 00:02:16,442
<i>...to make way for
construction of Delta City?</i>

26
00:02:16,817 --> 00:02:19,308
Nikko, you heard your mom.
Go on.

27
00:02:20,287 --> 00:02:21,845
Oh, man.

28
00:02:24,625 --> 00:02:26,320
<i>- And the homeless?
- What a gyp.</i>

29
00:02:26,526 --> 00:02:30,155
<i>Some buildings have to come down
before Delta can go up.</i>

30
00:02:30,564 --> 00:02:33,465
<i>I won't deny we're serving
an eviction notice or two...</i>

31
00:02:33,634 --> 00:02:38,469
<i>...but most of these people have already
taken their urine tests and placement exams.</i>

32
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:41,335
<i>They've got new jobs waiting for them.</i>

33
00:02:41,541 --> 00:02:44,442
<i>We're just helping them
make the transition, that's all.</i>

34
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:48,746
<i>- We're cops, nothing more.
- Nothing more?</i>

35
00:02:49,149 --> 00:02:51,640
<i>Well, we're not robots,
if that's what you mean.</i>

36
00:03:18,412 --> 00:03:19,709
Hey, Dad?

37
00:03:25,185 --> 00:03:26,880
You're supposed to be asleep.

38
00:03:27,321 --> 00:03:31,257
Is it true what the Tv said?

39
00:03:31,792 --> 00:03:33,657
That it's a war zone outside?

40
00:03:33,894 --> 00:03:38,126
Don't listen to what the Tv says.
This is your home, you hear me?

41
00:03:38,298 --> 00:03:40,129
And you're safe here.

42
00:03:47,341 --> 00:03:50,435
<i>I'll buy that for a dollar!</i>

43
00:03:51,278 --> 00:03:53,872
Get out, get out, get out!

44
00:04:01,455 --> 00:04:04,754
This neighborhood is the
property of omni Consumer Products.

45
00:04:31,752 --> 00:04:35,688
- For God's sake, help us!
- That's what we're here for, ma'am.

46
00:04:39,493 --> 00:04:41,552
Just get on the bus.

47
00:04:42,162 --> 00:04:45,359
Where are they taking us, Dad?
What's happening?

48
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,601
Don't believe them! They'll throw us
into the streets to die like rats!

49
00:04:51,772 --> 00:04:54,502
Nazi sons of bitches!

50
00:04:59,413 --> 00:05:01,643
Shoot her if you must,
but get her out of here.

51
00:05:01,815 --> 00:05:03,282
Yes, sir.

52
00:05:04,084 --> 00:05:06,484
Let's go. Come on.

53
00:05:06,686 --> 00:05:09,416
I think it's going rather well,
don't you?

54
00:05:09,623 --> 00:05:10,783
Yes, sir.

55
00:05:11,224 --> 00:05:13,852
Come on, I said, move! Move!

56
00:05:14,194 --> 00:05:17,652
- Manandle an old lady, would you?
- Shut up!

57
00:05:20,167 --> 00:05:21,862
- Move, move!
- Get up there!

58
00:05:22,269 --> 00:05:24,169
I said, get up!

59
00:05:25,238 --> 00:05:29,072
What are you doing down there?
Piece of slime!

60
00:05:29,676 --> 00:05:31,268
Can you hear me?

61
00:05:32,546 --> 00:05:35,106
I said, get up, you drunken cow!

62
00:05:38,318 --> 00:05:41,253
Get back! The crane's gonna blow!

63
00:05:52,766 --> 00:05:56,065
Listen to me, people!
These buses are going nowhere!

64
00:05:56,570 --> 00:06:01,269
Stay here! Fight for your homes!
There is no silver lining!

65
00:06:01,441 --> 00:06:06,208
Only corporate scumbags
who want to line their pockets!

66
00:06:13,253 --> 00:06:15,414
Nikko! Nikko!

67
00:06:15,589 --> 00:06:19,491
Mom! Mom! Dad!

68
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:25,298
Nikko! No! That's my baby!
Nikko, Nikko!

69
00:06:27,334 --> 00:06:31,100
Mom! Dad! Dad!

70
00:06:31,338 --> 00:06:33,101
Mom, Dad!

71
00:06:37,611 --> 00:06:39,476
Mom!

72
00:06:51,424 --> 00:06:53,358
Mom!

73
00:06:54,294 --> 00:06:55,693
Dad?!

74
00:06:58,198 --> 00:07:00,098
Mom!

75
00:07:11,745 --> 00:07:14,305
You! Stay where you are!

76
00:07:36,536 --> 00:07:41,166
<i>Repeat: The rehabilitation
officers are here to assist you.</i>

77
00:07:49,115 --> 00:07:52,778
It's okay, it's okay.
You're with us now.

78
00:07:53,687 --> 00:07:54,676
Is he gone?

79
00:07:55,689 --> 00:07:57,418
Are we clear?

80
00:07:57,591 --> 00:07:58,649
Clear!

81
00:07:59,726 --> 00:08:01,717
Okay, let's do it.

82
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:14,529
Okay, Moreno.

83
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:15,697
<i>Cover your ears.</i>

84
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:20,778
Rock 'r roll.

85
00:08:32,359 --> 00:08:34,327
<i>All clear. Let's go.</i>

86
00:08:48,742 --> 00:08:50,300
Jesus!

87
00:08:52,412 --> 00:08:54,880
- ED 209!
- He wasrt in the recon photo!

88
00:08:57,884 --> 00:09:01,547
Freeze! You are trespassing
on police property.

89
00:09:01,721 --> 00:09:03,313
Please surrender your weapons.

90
00:09:03,523 --> 00:09:05,354
- What the hell?
- Is she crazy?

91
00:09:05,525 --> 00:09:07,390
You have 20 seconds to comply.

92
00:09:07,594 --> 00:09:11,257
- Hey, kid, come back here!
- You're gonna get us all killed!

93
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,390
What the hell is she doing?

94
00:09:14,567 --> 00:09:18,663
You are in direct violation
of penal code 114, section 3.

95
00:09:18,838 --> 00:09:22,137
I am authorized to use physical force.

96
00:09:22,342 --> 00:09:25,311
You now have 10 seconds to comply.

97
00:09:26,379 --> 00:09:29,746
You won't believe this.
He'll be loyal as a puppy.

98
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:33,244
You have five seconds.
Four seconds.

99
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:38,086
Three seconds.
You have one second to comply.

100
00:09:38,258 --> 00:09:40,658
I am now authorized to...

101
00:09:41,661 --> 00:09:44,186
...be loyal as a puppy.

102
00:09:44,631 --> 00:09:45,757
Damn!

103
00:09:54,441 --> 00:09:55,430
Will it work?

104
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:58,610
Stole it off a dead cop.

105
00:10:06,119 --> 00:10:08,246
Holy shit! That's the police armory!

106
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:14,723
- They deleted the access signature.
- Let's get out of here!

107
00:10:15,228 --> 00:10:18,527
They'll be a few minutes. Let's
figure out how to open that door!

108
00:10:18,698 --> 00:10:19,858
Are you kidding me?

109
00:11:02,242 --> 00:11:04,073
One-stop shopping.

110
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:13,381
- Let's go! Gotta get out of here!
- He's right. Let's ride.

111
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:20,216
- What are you, picking out drapes?
- Coming!

112
00:11:25,598 --> 00:11:27,190
- Get that.
- Why?

113
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,459
It looks expensive.

114
00:11:35,842 --> 00:11:37,776
Come on! Come on, let's go!

115
00:11:43,817 --> 00:11:45,182
Drop your weapons now!

116
00:11:45,585 --> 00:11:47,280
Do it! Drop them!

117
00:11:53,726 --> 00:11:56,854
Freeze! You're trespassing
on police property.

118
00:11:58,364 --> 00:12:00,127
Eat lead, suckers!

119
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:12,441
Nikko, get in! Come on!

120
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:52,147
What can I do for you?

121
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,151
Nobody move!

122
00:12:56,322 --> 00:12:58,586
Everything in the register!
Now! Do it!

123
00:13:07,467 --> 00:13:10,300
What's it like
being a rocket scientist?

124
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:15,100
<i>All units, we have a B and E involving
police property, please respond.</i>

125
00:13:15,275 --> 00:13:17,607
<i>Repeat, all units, we have a...</i>

126
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:20,677
Hey, Donnelly, it's your turn.

127
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,714
- No way. We went last time.
- No, it's Lewis' turn.

128
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,644
Lewis, you're up.

129
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:33,450
Lewis! Lewis! Lewis!

130
00:13:35,161 --> 00:13:38,153
Isn't anybody gonna arrest me,
or what?!

131
00:13:38,531 --> 00:13:41,591
- Where's your friend Murphy?
- He's not big on doughnuts.

132
00:13:41,768 --> 00:13:43,827
- He's not big on doughnuts.
- I knew that.

133
00:13:44,237 --> 00:13:47,729
<i>All units, repeat,
that is a battered yellow van.</i>

134
00:13:48,107 --> 00:13:50,507
<i>No plates.
Tracking shows southbound...</i>

135
00:13:51,377 --> 00:13:54,574
- That's a battered yellow van.
- No shit, Sherlock.

136
00:14:05,692 --> 00:14:07,626
Moreno, company's coming!

137
00:14:11,564 --> 00:14:13,088
Hold on. Here we go.

138
00:14:19,672 --> 00:14:23,472
Unit 477 in pursuit,
eastbound, Esposito.

139
00:14:32,752 --> 00:14:33,776
Watch it!

140
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,485
I'm watching it!

141
00:14:58,411 --> 00:14:59,400
Jesus!

142
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:15,727
They're still on our tail.

143
00:15:16,229 --> 00:15:17,753
Don't sweat it.

144
00:15:18,097 --> 00:15:20,065
Hey, kid. Watch this.

145
00:16:01,407 --> 00:16:03,272
Hold the champagne.

146
00:16:13,686 --> 00:16:15,677
You stopped in the middle
of the street!

147
00:16:15,855 --> 00:16:18,483
- That was my light!
- You idiot!

148
00:16:18,658 --> 00:16:21,684
- Is everybody okay?
- Okay? What are you, a comedian?

149
00:16:21,894 --> 00:16:25,261
I traded in a brand new SUX
for this classic. Now look at it!

150
00:16:25,431 --> 00:16:27,865
It's garbage. It's going to the junkyard.

151
00:16:28,234 --> 00:16:33,262
What is this, fellas? You give a broad
a badge and she gets delusions of gander.

152
00:16:33,439 --> 00:16:36,169
It's "grandeur," dumbshit.

153
00:16:39,745 --> 00:16:42,441
This new guy is making me nervous.

154
00:16:43,349 --> 00:16:45,613
I don't think this is exactly a guy.

155
00:16:45,785 --> 00:16:47,446
You think it's him?

156
00:16:53,359 --> 00:16:55,122
Unit 477 to dispatch.

157
00:16:55,294 --> 00:16:58,525
This is 477 to dispatch.
Come in, dispatch.

158
00:16:58,698 --> 00:17:00,598
We could use some backup out here.

159
00:17:00,766 --> 00:17:04,634
Hello, dispatch. Come in.
This is 477 to dispatch.

160
00:17:05,505 --> 00:17:06,597
Lewis.

161
00:17:12,445 --> 00:17:13,844
Splatterpunks.

162
00:17:16,315 --> 00:17:19,546
Wait a second, what do you need
the shotgun for?

163
00:17:19,719 --> 00:17:21,653
Shit, we're all gonna die.

164
00:17:21,854 --> 00:17:24,550
- Sit tight, people. Backup's coming.
- Sit tight?

165
00:17:24,724 --> 00:17:29,252
If it wasrt for you, I wouldn't
even be here, you dumb broad.

166
00:17:29,428 --> 00:17:33,592
I'll make you a deal, tough guy.
You want to eat the tie, keep it up.

167
00:17:33,799 --> 00:17:36,359
Take it easy. My brother's a cop.

168
00:18:19,111 --> 00:18:23,844
<i>477 to dispatch, code 3! We're low
on ammo and need immediate backup!</i>

169
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:25,139
<i>Right now!</i>

170
00:18:34,894 --> 00:18:36,225
Sergeant Reed.

171
00:18:36,729 --> 00:18:38,663
I got Murphy's cruiser on the grid.

172
00:18:38,864 --> 00:18:41,264
- He just turned around.
- He what?!

173
00:19:04,757 --> 00:19:06,725
Murphy, this is Reed.

174
00:19:06,892 --> 00:19:09,793
I have three other vehicles
en route to Lewis.

175
00:19:10,429 --> 00:19:15,492
Murphy, continue pursuit! That is a
direct order! Do I make myself clear?

176
00:19:15,668 --> 00:19:17,260
<i>Murphy, are you listen...?</i>

177
00:20:26,572 --> 00:20:29,336
Police officer. No loitering.

178
00:20:45,725 --> 00:20:47,124
You called for backup?

179
00:20:52,465 --> 00:20:54,797
Thanks for dropping by, Murphy.

180
00:20:55,634 --> 00:20:57,363
Are they gone?

181
00:20:58,137 --> 00:21:00,196
I'm still scanning three.

182
00:21:08,414 --> 00:21:10,473
Make that two.

183
00:21:16,756 --> 00:21:19,156
Block it! Megazone invasion!

184
00:21:19,325 --> 00:21:22,624
Pop a tranq, hypo-head.
Splatterville's ours.

185
00:21:23,362 --> 00:21:25,227
Shoot him in the mouth.

186
00:21:25,464 --> 00:21:27,295
Cyborg eats bullets, Jock.

187
00:21:28,067 --> 00:21:29,364
Not tonight he don't.

188
00:22:20,786 --> 00:22:22,151
Hit him in the mouth!

189
00:22:22,354 --> 00:22:24,254
- Shut up!
- Do it! Do it!

190
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:26,381
- Do it! Do it!
- Shut up!

191
00:22:31,297 --> 00:22:33,060
Nice try, creeps.

192
00:22:33,232 --> 00:22:34,221
Give me it!

193
00:22:35,668 --> 00:22:38,102
You have the right to remain silent.

194
00:22:47,446 --> 00:22:48,879
Down there.

195
00:22:55,087 --> 00:22:56,816
Jesus, Murphy, are you okay?

196
00:22:57,156 --> 00:22:58,851
I'm fine, Anne.

197
00:22:59,191 --> 00:23:00,624
Thank you for asking.

198
00:23:02,661 --> 00:23:04,253
Come on, come on!

199
00:23:19,778 --> 00:23:22,747
Let's go! Everything
will be all right.

200
00:23:26,085 --> 00:23:27,575
Get your damn hands off me!

201
00:23:32,791 --> 00:23:34,190
Stupid kid.

202
00:23:44,403 --> 00:23:47,634
- Come here. Come on.
- Would you forget the stupid kid already?!

203
00:24:28,647 --> 00:24:30,547
Kanemitsu-san...

204
00:24:30,716 --> 00:24:33,344
...I realize we've had setbacks...

205
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:38,479
...but we've done everything possible
to get Delta City back on schedule.

206
00:24:52,237 --> 00:24:53,363
Gentlemen...

207
00:24:55,674 --> 00:24:58,609
...you are now looking at a company...

208
00:24:58,777 --> 00:25:00,267
...in transition.

209
00:25:01,146 --> 00:25:05,549
Needless to say, this has resulted in
the implementation of certain...

210
00:25:05,718 --> 00:25:07,151
...well...

211
00:25:07,319 --> 00:25:08,786
...let's call them...

212
00:25:09,521 --> 00:25:11,250
..."cutbacks. "

213
00:25:11,423 --> 00:25:14,483
But who can put a price tag
on a dream?

214
00:25:16,261 --> 00:25:19,389
Our esteemed former chairman
had a dream.

215
00:25:19,565 --> 00:25:21,328
He called it Delta City.

216
00:25:22,401 --> 00:25:23,868
Knock it off, Johnson.

217
00:25:27,506 --> 00:25:31,875
The great city of Detroit represents
an important precedent, gentlemen.

218
00:25:32,444 --> 00:25:35,072
There's only one small problem.

219
00:25:35,514 --> 00:25:37,778
It's turning into a war zone!

220
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:39,777
It's just a small resistance group.

221
00:25:40,119 --> 00:25:43,111
There's no reason to believe they
pose a significant threat.

222
00:25:43,355 --> 00:25:44,822
I'd consider...

223
00:25:45,157 --> 00:25:49,355
...a deficit of 350 million dollars
a significant threat.

224
00:25:49,561 --> 00:25:51,085
Wouldrt you?

225
00:25:52,765 --> 00:25:54,528
- Fleck!
- Sir.

226
00:25:54,667 --> 00:25:56,794
You're in charge of Security Concepts.

227
00:25:57,102 --> 00:26:00,128
Where's that Robocop
we spent so much money on?

228
00:26:00,305 --> 00:26:04,241
The police had a problem
with the unit. I'm dealing with it personally.

229
00:26:04,410 --> 00:26:05,809
You do that.

230
00:26:06,412 --> 00:26:08,073
Get him to the Rehab Team...

231
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:12,740
...and maybe we won't have to worry
about a "small resistance group. "

232
00:26:13,085 --> 00:26:15,315
Get the hell out of here, all of you!

233
00:26:15,487 --> 00:26:16,749
You take your time.

234
00:26:17,089 --> 00:26:19,250
And for God's sake, Fleck...

235
00:26:19,425 --> 00:26:22,326
...try to get the police on our side.

236
00:26:27,433 --> 00:26:30,425
What if I don't want
a robot on my team?

237
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:34,498
You've got 4 days, McDaggett.

238
00:26:35,074 --> 00:26:38,566
If Cadillac Heights isn't cleared
for demolition Friday midnight...

239
00:26:38,777 --> 00:26:42,770
...our loans will be called in.
OCP will be ruined.

240
00:26:43,148 --> 00:26:44,877
We made a deal, didn't we, chum.

241
00:26:45,884 --> 00:26:48,182
Oh, by the way...

242
00:26:49,188 --> 00:26:53,852
...if you're just figuring out the
line between big business and war...

243
00:26:54,193 --> 00:26:56,354
...is a little blurry...

244
00:26:56,562 --> 00:26:59,326
...then you're further over the hill
than they say.

245
00:27:52,351 --> 00:27:56,151
This is entrapment! My client was
visiting close friends in that motel.

246
00:27:56,321 --> 00:27:59,415
Hey, buddy. Your client's friends...

247
00:27:59,591 --> 00:28:02,651
...were a non-union video crew
and a German shepherd.

248
00:28:02,861 --> 00:28:04,260
That's prejudicial.

249
00:28:04,429 --> 00:28:08,195
Did the arresting officer
ask to see their union cards?

250
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:11,767
Come get this crap.
Will someone answer the damn phone?!

251
00:28:12,137 --> 00:28:16,096
Metro West. No, ma'am,
we're not on strike.

252
00:28:16,275 --> 00:28:19,733
You could have fooled me.
I'll deal with those looters myself.

253
00:28:20,078 --> 00:28:22,774
Get me a baseball bat
with some nails in it.

254
00:28:31,523 --> 00:28:33,150
How are you feeling?

255
00:28:34,693 --> 00:28:36,320
I've been better.

256
00:28:37,296 --> 00:28:41,426
To be honest, it looks like you just
made friends with a Mack truck.

257
00:28:43,402 --> 00:28:45,131
I don't have many...

258
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:46,328
...friends.

259
00:28:57,516 --> 00:28:58,505
Dr. Lazarus.

260
00:29:00,485 --> 00:29:05,445
- You want to tell me what happened?
- Atlanta beat the Pistons last night.

261
00:29:05,624 --> 00:29:09,617
- That's cute. I meant with glory boy.
- Oh, him.

262
00:29:10,362 --> 00:29:13,263
He got shot to hell and set on fire.

263
00:29:13,432 --> 00:29:17,061
You know what I'm talking about.
He disobeyed a direct order. Why?

264
00:29:17,236 --> 00:29:20,797
- My real opinion?
- No, lie. Make up a story.

265
00:29:22,074 --> 00:29:23,701
Well, Mr. Fleck...

266
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:26,607
...offhand...

267
00:29:26,778 --> 00:29:30,714
...I'd say the only reason
he'd disobey an order is if...

268
00:29:30,883 --> 00:29:32,714
...he didn't agree with it.

269
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,109
Excuse me?

270
00:29:37,422 --> 00:29:39,322
He made a decision.

271
00:29:39,625 --> 00:29:43,561
His friend was in trouble, he made
a judgment call. Cops do that.

272
00:29:43,729 --> 00:29:46,789
Human cops. What do you mean,
"his friend"? It's a machine.

273
00:29:47,099 --> 00:29:51,365
Look, if oCP just wanted a robot, why'd
they put Murphy in there in the first place?

274
00:29:51,503 --> 00:29:53,801
Murphy's dead, sweetheart,
that's on record.

275
00:29:54,139 --> 00:29:56,607
Mr. Fleck, this is Murphy!

276
00:29:56,775 --> 00:29:59,471
What's left of his face,
his cerebrum, his cerebellum.

277
00:29:59,645 --> 00:30:01,875
Human tissue that's still alive.

278
00:30:02,214 --> 00:30:04,273
How can you interface human
and machine...

279
00:30:04,449 --> 00:30:07,145
...then complain
when the human part makes a decision?

280
00:30:10,289 --> 00:30:13,781
So not only did we get Murphy's
years of training...

281
00:30:14,092 --> 00:30:17,619
...and his law-enforcement skills,
we also inerited...

282
00:30:17,796 --> 00:30:21,698
...his memories, his feelings,
his emotional baggage?

283
00:30:22,067 --> 00:30:27,300
Well, I'd call it his humanity,
but I don't think you know that word.

284
00:30:28,307 --> 00:30:29,467
I see.

285
00:30:31,276 --> 00:30:34,370
You talked me into it.
His emotions: Get rid of them.

286
00:30:35,647 --> 00:30:39,777
Find their location and erase them.
If it wipes out his memory, too bad.

287
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:45,383
We could cut out
the appropriate circuits by...

288
00:30:46,358 --> 00:30:49,691
...implanting a micro-neuro-barrier.

289
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,158
Do it.

290
00:30:58,437 --> 00:31:01,406
I got news for you.
I don't give a shit how smart you are.

291
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:05,567
OCP owns the cops. That means they
own him, and they own your cute little ass.

292
00:31:06,244 --> 00:31:08,109
Nobody owns me.

293
00:31:08,714 --> 00:31:10,079
Fine.

294
00:31:10,315 --> 00:31:14,081
We want him on the Rehab Team.

295
00:31:14,353 --> 00:31:18,255
That means you make him predictable,
or look for a new job, sweet cheeks.

296
00:31:25,163 --> 00:31:26,755
I think I'm in love.

297
00:31:42,247 --> 00:31:44,511
What's going through your head?

298
00:32:01,833 --> 00:32:03,232
That's his family.

299
00:32:04,069 --> 00:32:06,697
Want me to install
the neuro-barrier, doctor?

300
00:32:07,072 --> 00:32:08,869
No, I can do it.

301
00:32:16,181 --> 00:32:19,082
I think I'd like to be alone with him,
if it's all right.

302
00:32:47,879 --> 00:32:50,871
<i>Alex, I thought
you'd never get home.</i>

303
00:32:56,354 --> 00:33:00,586
Don't let the fact that these people
are homeless sway you.

304
00:33:02,227 --> 00:33:04,821
They're terrorists, pure and simple.

305
00:33:06,164 --> 00:33:10,191
On the screens
are suspected rebel locations.

306
00:33:10,402 --> 00:33:14,395
If these locations appear
on your regular beat, check it out.

307
00:33:14,573 --> 00:33:18,634
Make sure you report
any unusual findings...

308
00:33:20,779 --> 00:33:22,406
Hear what they did to Murphy?

309
00:34:08,393 --> 00:34:09,655
Murphy.

310
00:34:32,751 --> 00:34:34,810
Lewis, you want your body armor?

311
00:34:35,187 --> 00:34:37,815
What? No, I'm off duty.

312
00:34:40,792 --> 00:34:42,521
What's up, anyway?

313
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:44,488
Do you have family?

314
00:34:45,330 --> 00:34:49,562
Yeah, I have a brother in Pittsburgh,
the one who never calls. You know that.

315
00:34:51,336 --> 00:34:53,099
Robo, are you okay?

316
00:34:53,405 --> 00:34:54,838
I'm fine.

317
00:34:56,441 --> 00:34:58,102
And call me Murphy.

318
00:36:03,775 --> 00:36:05,265
Murphy?

319
00:36:10,782 --> 00:36:12,716
<i>Step out of the building.</i>

320
00:36:34,372 --> 00:36:36,465
Stay right there.

321
00:36:36,875 --> 00:36:38,775
We're police officers.

322
00:36:39,110 --> 00:36:40,236
We don't want you.

323
00:36:40,445 --> 00:36:44,176
We believe there are squatters in there.
Now step away from the door.

324
00:36:44,349 --> 00:36:47,443
They're civilians.
They're just trying to stay warm!

325
00:36:47,652 --> 00:36:50,712
Those people belong
in the nearest rehabilitation center.

326
00:36:54,125 --> 00:36:58,858
Some are terrorists. Step away or you
will be cited for obstructing justice.

327
00:37:04,069 --> 00:37:06,299
I'm not going to ask politely next time.

328
00:37:06,471 --> 00:37:07,870
Step away from the door.

329
00:37:11,409 --> 00:37:13,741
This is your final warning.

330
00:37:27,092 --> 00:37:29,492
You are making a mistake.

331
00:37:33,164 --> 00:37:37,191
- Back off, or there'll be trouble.
- Now you're talking, Murphy.

332
00:37:37,402 --> 00:37:41,236
We're not budging. If you wanna get in,
you'll have to shoot through us.

333
00:37:42,741 --> 00:37:45,539
I don't have a huge problem with that.

334
00:38:13,405 --> 00:38:14,497
Cease fire!

335
00:38:29,187 --> 00:38:30,484
Robocop.

336
00:38:36,394 --> 00:38:38,453
Come on, come on, come on!

337
00:38:44,135 --> 00:38:45,261
Come with us!

338
00:38:46,871 --> 00:38:48,168
Cover me.

339
00:39:27,345 --> 00:39:30,746
Some tough cop I am. Huh, partner?

340
00:39:36,221 --> 00:39:38,485
I'm scared.

341
00:39:39,824 --> 00:39:41,382
Don't be.

342
00:39:41,559 --> 00:39:43,550
It won't hurt long.

343
00:39:45,864 --> 00:39:47,729
Get them for me.

344
00:39:48,733 --> 00:39:50,291
Promise me.

345
00:39:50,468 --> 00:39:52,766
I promise.

346
00:39:55,773 --> 00:39:57,365
Murphy.

347
00:40:07,252 --> 00:40:09,083
Officer down.

348
00:40:19,063 --> 00:40:20,257
Move it!

349
00:40:20,398 --> 00:40:22,832
We don't have much time.

350
00:40:23,535 --> 00:40:24,593
Nikko, let's go.

351
00:40:24,769 --> 00:40:27,237
Come on. Come with us.

352
00:40:27,705 --> 00:40:30,071
Is she crazy?
He's a cop! He's one of them!

353
00:40:31,342 --> 00:40:33,173
He's on our side now.

354
00:40:33,344 --> 00:40:35,403
She's right. You saw what he did.

355
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:38,071
You'll let a stupid kid
make our decisions?

356
00:40:38,249 --> 00:40:41,741
- We're at war. We can use his help.
- Are you kidding me? Look at him!

357
00:40:42,086 --> 00:40:43,576
He is totaled, man!

358
00:40:43,755 --> 00:40:46,315
People, come on.
We don't have time for this shit.

359
00:40:49,594 --> 00:40:50,561
He's right.

360
00:40:52,263 --> 00:40:53,389
We should go.

361
00:41:09,514 --> 00:41:12,312
Five-meter spread.
Search the perimeter.

362
00:41:14,819 --> 00:41:15,877
Damn.

363
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:20,520
- We're tracking him, sir. He's moving.
- Impossible. The building is surrounded.

364
00:41:21,259 --> 00:41:23,227
He's gone underground.

365
00:41:23,394 --> 00:41:24,827
Find a manole.

366
00:41:48,853 --> 00:41:50,821
We got a little held up.

367
00:42:01,699 --> 00:42:03,326
Rats?

368
00:42:06,137 --> 00:42:07,126
One or two.

369
00:42:13,077 --> 00:42:13,873
Go on through.

370
00:42:24,389 --> 00:42:25,617
Are you okay?

371
00:42:29,661 --> 00:42:31,629
I'm fine.

372
00:42:33,364 --> 00:42:34,490
Hey!

373
00:42:35,566 --> 00:42:37,261
You guys!

374
00:42:41,539 --> 00:42:43,200
Oh, man!

375
00:42:43,441 --> 00:42:45,568
I told you it was a mistake to bring him.

376
00:42:45,777 --> 00:42:47,369
I bet he weighs a ton.

377
00:42:50,381 --> 00:42:52,315
Watch your step.

378
00:42:52,450 --> 00:42:53,508
All right.

379
00:42:54,786 --> 00:42:56,447
Clear the way.

380
00:42:56,621 --> 00:42:58,885
- Get out of the way.
- Hold up your side.

381
00:43:05,530 --> 00:43:06,519
He don't look good.

382
00:43:06,698 --> 00:43:10,657
You wouldn't look so good either
if you took a grenade in your chest.

383
00:43:11,135 --> 00:43:12,602
Tracking.

384
00:43:13,371 --> 00:43:14,804
- Beacon.
- Tracking?

385
00:43:16,674 --> 00:43:18,403
He'll lead them right to us!

386
00:43:18,609 --> 00:43:20,372
Shut up, Coontz!

387
00:43:20,545 --> 00:43:21,773
What's he talking about?

388
00:43:37,261 --> 00:43:40,628
- Did he booby-trap the 8th Street entrance?
- Maybe.

389
00:44:09,894 --> 00:44:12,294
Better get mobilized, folks.

390
00:44:12,797 --> 00:44:15,823
They got a little too close
to home that time.

391
00:44:17,268 --> 00:44:18,792
It's not won'th it.

392
00:44:19,137 --> 00:44:20,832
It's not won'th this shit!

393
00:44:22,507 --> 00:44:25,271
You better take
a real deep breath right now, Coontz.

394
00:44:25,443 --> 00:44:27,775
Because if you don't think
it's won'th it...

395
00:44:28,112 --> 00:44:31,548
...then you're nothing but excess baggage.
Do you hear me?!

396
00:44:33,584 --> 00:44:35,779
You get it together, Coontz.

397
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:39,817
Cadillac Heights may not be much,
but it's our home.

398
00:44:40,158 --> 00:44:41,819
It's all we got.

399
00:44:42,493 --> 00:44:46,793
If you don't think our homes is won'th
it, then tell me what the hell is.

400
00:44:53,805 --> 00:44:56,399
This is Bertha to Base op.
We're coming in.

401
00:44:56,607 --> 00:44:58,575
Set an extra place.

402
00:44:58,776 --> 00:45:00,835
We're bringing in a friend.

403
00:45:07,885 --> 00:45:10,149
<i>Incoming caller.</i>

404
00:45:16,394 --> 00:45:17,361
What do you want?

405
00:45:18,062 --> 00:45:19,654
<i>Nice work, dollface.</i>

406
00:45:19,831 --> 00:45:21,355
What you talking about?

407
00:45:21,532 --> 00:45:23,864
<i>You haven't heard?</i>

408
00:45:24,235 --> 00:45:26,362
<i>You might want to turn on Media Break.</i>

409
00:45:27,605 --> 00:45:30,073
Tv on, channel 378.

410
00:45:30,241 --> 00:45:34,200
<i>Witness to the tragic shooting
was Rehab Commander, Paul McDaggett.</i>

411
00:45:36,147 --> 00:45:40,675
<i>All I can say is it's a terrible loss
of a fine public servant.</i>

412
00:45:41,285 --> 00:45:45,187
<i>It's hard to believe that she was
gunned down by her own partner.</i>

413
00:45:46,224 --> 00:45:48,192
<i>An OCP spokesperson has confirmed...</i>

414
00:45:48,326 --> 00:45:51,454
<i>...that Robocop has joined
the terrorist rebel forces.</i>

415
00:45:51,629 --> 00:45:55,622
<i>He is heavily armed and should be
considered extremely dangerous.</i>

416
00:45:56,234 --> 00:45:57,565
Tv off.

417
00:45:57,735 --> 00:46:01,865
<i>Congratulations, sweet cheeks.
Now listen up. I want your legendary ass...</i>

418
00:46:02,206 --> 00:46:04,606
<i>...and your corporate I.D. Card
in my office...</i>

419
00:46:04,742 --> 00:46:08,769
<i>...by 7:00 a. m. Tomorrow. And maybe
you won't be brought up on charges.</i>

420
00:46:09,113 --> 00:46:12,378
<i>Meantime, you might want to decide
whose side you're on.</i>

421
00:46:13,851 --> 00:46:15,648
<i>Sleep tight.</i>

422
00:46:24,662 --> 00:46:28,291
- He what?
- Shot at Rehabs and went underground.

423
00:46:28,466 --> 00:46:32,527
- There goes our P.R. Budget.
- Company line is he's gone renegade.

424
00:46:32,737 --> 00:46:35,205
- How'd the CEo take it?
- How do you think?

425
00:46:35,373 --> 00:46:38,570
Between me and you,
I think the CEo's losing it.

426
00:46:38,743 --> 00:46:41,109
I mean, take a look around, will you?

427
00:46:41,279 --> 00:46:43,304
It's the Fall of Rome around here.

428
00:46:43,481 --> 00:46:46,177
It's Darwin time,
you know what I'm saying?

429
00:46:46,350 --> 00:46:48,477
Survival of the least expendable.

430
00:46:48,653 --> 00:46:52,612
Remember the old man.
Everyone's expendable.

431
00:46:54,191 --> 00:46:57,160
<i>It can't be that bad.</i>

432
00:46:57,361 --> 00:46:59,329
<i>Honey, can you hear me?</i>

433
00:47:00,131 --> 00:47:01,530
<i>Are you there?</i>

434
00:47:03,267 --> 00:47:07,203
<i>Every corporation
goes through this sort of thing.</i>

435
00:47:27,391 --> 00:47:29,689
Oh, my God, what happened?

436
00:47:31,829 --> 00:47:32,796
What's happening?

437
00:47:33,164 --> 00:47:34,756
Arnott just went out the window.

438
00:47:35,099 --> 00:47:37,829
- That's the fourth one this month.
- Chickenshit.

439
00:47:38,202 --> 00:47:40,670
I'd eat a bullet myself.

440
00:47:40,838 --> 00:47:42,396
Less showy.

441
00:47:45,242 --> 00:47:48,109
The writing was on the wall
the minute we hopped...

442
00:47:48,279 --> 00:47:51,510
...in the sack with that shitty
Kanemitsu corporation.

443
00:47:57,088 --> 00:47:58,316
As I was saying...

444
00:48:00,291 --> 00:48:03,260
...we have a warrant out
for Robocop's arrest.

445
00:48:03,427 --> 00:48:08,091
If we can eliminate him, then we'll
find that the squatters are more...

446
00:48:08,265 --> 00:48:11,098
...let's say, easily persuaded.

447
00:48:24,115 --> 00:48:27,084
Fleck. A word with you, son.

448
00:48:27,251 --> 00:48:29,742
I'm sorry for the intrusion, sir.

449
00:48:30,087 --> 00:48:32,180
Anything Security Concepts can do?

450
00:48:32,690 --> 00:48:37,184
Security Concepts can kiss
my freckled butt. You're fired.

451
00:48:38,362 --> 00:48:41,854
You heard me!
You're fired. Get out of here.

452
00:48:50,775 --> 00:48:52,743
Three days until disaster.

453
00:48:53,110 --> 00:48:55,772
What the hell
will I tell my shareholders?

454
00:48:56,814 --> 00:48:58,611
What about more Rehabs, sir?

455
00:48:58,816 --> 00:49:02,343
We could recruit them
out of the Police Department.

456
00:49:03,287 --> 00:49:05,380
It would be cheaper than mercenaries...

457
00:49:05,523 --> 00:49:09,152
...and we could use the Metro West facility
as a staging area.

458
00:49:10,594 --> 00:49:13,188
Give them a nominal raise
for an incentive.

459
00:49:13,364 --> 00:49:15,389
You're a good man, Johnson.

460
00:49:15,566 --> 00:49:18,399
I knew there was a reason
I made you a vice president.

461
00:49:18,569 --> 00:49:19,627
Thank you, sir.

462
00:49:19,804 --> 00:49:21,772
I really...

463
00:50:04,248 --> 00:50:06,216
Heads up!

464
00:50:08,152 --> 00:50:10,382
Come on, let's go. We're gonna be late!

465
00:51:02,306 --> 00:51:03,330
Well?

466
00:51:03,507 --> 00:51:04,735
Can you fix him?

467
00:51:06,677 --> 00:51:09,168
This isn't a valve job on a Chevy.

468
00:51:10,381 --> 00:51:13,179
I never worked
on a damn Robocop before.

469
00:51:13,350 --> 00:51:15,875
- I can do the body work, but...
- Look...

470
00:51:16,220 --> 00:51:19,212
...we gotta hang on to the Heights
for three more days.

471
00:51:20,324 --> 00:51:23,816
- He can hold out till then, can't he?
- Are you listening to me?!

472
00:51:25,663 --> 00:51:28,393
He's messed up.
We don't have the equipment.

473
00:51:28,566 --> 00:51:30,193
Who the hell does?!

474
00:51:31,769 --> 00:51:32,827
Lazarus.

475
00:51:37,408 --> 00:51:40,400
Find doctor...

476
00:51:41,845 --> 00:51:43,073
...Lazarus.

477
00:52:17,548 --> 00:52:19,311
Who are you?

478
00:52:19,483 --> 00:52:21,508
I'm friends with Robocop.

479
00:52:25,222 --> 00:52:27,315
Well, he's not here. I'm sorry.

480
00:52:27,658 --> 00:52:29,091
You don't believe me.

481
00:52:35,599 --> 00:52:38,466
To tell you the truth,
I don't know what to believe anymore.

482
00:52:38,736 --> 00:52:40,670
He had a message for you.

483
00:52:42,072 --> 00:52:46,532
He said to thank you for not
taking his memories away.

484
00:53:07,598 --> 00:53:09,862
Well, well, well.

485
00:53:11,235 --> 00:53:13,396
Afraid you're a little late, pal.

486
00:53:15,639 --> 00:53:18,802
You must be one of Kanemitsu's boys.

487
00:53:19,410 --> 00:53:20,775
I'm impressed.

488
00:53:21,578 --> 00:53:23,102
Trouble is...

489
00:53:26,350 --> 00:53:27,544
...your boss...

490
00:53:29,153 --> 00:53:31,417
...he kind of owns oCP.

491
00:53:31,588 --> 00:53:34,682
And oCP's kind of on our shitlist
with a bullet!

492
00:54:15,766 --> 00:54:18,860
So you want to know
where the rebels are?

493
00:54:19,870 --> 00:54:23,203
You can tell your bosses
to kiss my ass!

494
00:55:03,147 --> 00:55:05,081
A vehicle is approaching.

495
00:56:01,538 --> 00:56:03,165
How you doing, Murphy?

496
00:56:03,674 --> 00:56:05,232
I've been better.

497
00:56:05,609 --> 00:56:08,407
- Give me a status scan.
- Organics intact.

498
00:56:09,146 --> 00:56:12,638
Systems efficiency: 23 percent.

499
00:56:14,151 --> 00:56:16,278
Looks like a direct hit to the heart.

500
00:56:16,653 --> 00:56:19,121
We have to recalibrate
the pneumatic system.

501
00:56:19,289 --> 00:56:20,813
Is he gonna die?

502
00:56:22,860 --> 00:56:24,657
Not if I can help it.

503
00:56:25,596 --> 00:56:28,190
Let's get everything hooked up
to the generator.

504
00:56:28,699 --> 00:56:30,189
We've got work to do.

505
00:56:33,737 --> 00:56:35,227
I'm going to unplug you
for a little while.

506
00:56:36,607 --> 00:56:39,303
Don't worry,
everything's gonna be okay.

507
00:56:45,449 --> 00:56:46,575
Here you go.

508
00:56:48,185 --> 00:56:50,119
I got that heart you wanted.

509
00:56:50,754 --> 00:56:52,813
I said a Nissan. That's a Kanemitsu.

510
00:56:53,390 --> 00:56:56,484
Zack, we need that sealant! Zack!

511
00:56:56,660 --> 00:56:58,651
Marie! Marie! Look!

512
00:56:58,862 --> 00:57:00,489
Oh, shit.

513
00:57:02,699 --> 00:57:04,758
Bring me that chest plate over here.

514
00:57:09,239 --> 00:57:11,400
You wait, man.

515
00:57:11,608 --> 00:57:14,099
You are gonna be so cherry.

516
00:57:14,778 --> 00:57:16,837
Moreno, watch out for the...

517
00:57:17,614 --> 00:57:19,377
What the hell are you doing?

518
00:57:19,550 --> 00:57:22,383
I didn't know that thing was there!

519
00:57:22,553 --> 00:57:25,181
- Don't yell at me!
- Well, don't do it.

520
00:57:41,738 --> 00:57:42,796
Murphy.

521
00:57:43,340 --> 00:57:44,602
It's you.

522
00:57:51,315 --> 00:57:53,840
Alex, I thought you'd never get home.

523
00:58:22,312 --> 00:58:23,870
Welcome home, Murphy.

524
00:58:52,275 --> 00:58:53,299
I couldn't sleep.

525
00:58:53,710 --> 00:58:55,109
How are you feeling?

526
00:58:55,512 --> 00:58:57,878
My efficiency rate is 93 percent.

527
00:58:59,816 --> 00:59:02,216
Anything above 90
is considered normal.

528
00:59:04,221 --> 00:59:06,121
I heard Marie call you Murphy.

529
00:59:07,224 --> 00:59:08,589
Is that your real name?

530
00:59:09,693 --> 00:59:10,785
It was...

531
00:59:11,695 --> 00:59:12,821
...before...

532
00:59:14,431 --> 00:59:15,591
Before what?

533
00:59:28,812 --> 00:59:30,404
So...

534
00:59:33,583 --> 00:59:37,212
Now that you're better, will you stay?

535
00:59:37,387 --> 00:59:38,684
Will you help us?

536
00:59:39,656 --> 00:59:44,116
You know what Bertha says. If we hold
back the Rehabs for two more days...

537
00:59:44,294 --> 00:59:46,125
...they can't make us move.

538
00:59:46,296 --> 00:59:50,858
And they'll have to let my parents go.
We'll all be together like family again.

539
00:59:53,236 --> 00:59:54,567
Your parents?

540
01:00:17,728 --> 01:00:20,094
Murphy? You okay?

541
01:00:20,731 --> 01:00:23,825
Your parents, you miss them?

542
01:00:27,237 --> 01:00:28,363
Yeah.

543
01:00:31,341 --> 01:00:32,330
But...

544
01:00:32,876 --> 01:00:34,275
...you remember them.

545
01:00:36,346 --> 01:00:37,404
Because...

546
01:00:38,548 --> 01:00:40,413
...if you remember them...

547
01:00:41,585 --> 01:00:43,280
...they're never really gone.

548
01:01:04,875 --> 01:01:06,365
Hey, Murphy...

549
01:01:07,744 --> 01:01:10,372
...I'm glad your new heart works.

550
01:01:16,853 --> 01:01:17,842
I heard voices.

551
01:01:24,094 --> 01:01:25,652
She should be in bed.

552
01:01:30,834 --> 01:01:32,392
Could you leave her...

553
01:01:33,470 --> 01:01:34,801
...just a moment?

554
01:01:39,242 --> 01:01:40,231
Of course.

555
01:02:06,803 --> 01:02:08,703
You gotta pay for that.

556
01:02:16,179 --> 01:02:17,737
What are you, deaf?

557
01:02:18,081 --> 01:02:19,173
Son of a...

558
01:02:39,769 --> 01:02:41,498
That's not what we said.

559
01:02:41,671 --> 01:02:44,504
It's not what we said
we were gonna do!

560
01:02:44,674 --> 01:02:47,074
Bertha, you said
to relocate the weapons...

561
01:02:47,244 --> 01:02:49,474
...but where do you want this thing?

562
01:02:51,448 --> 01:02:53,348
Oh, my God.

563
01:02:55,218 --> 01:02:56,742
How did you get this?

564
01:02:57,320 --> 01:02:59,754
We stole it from the police depot. Why?

565
01:03:00,090 --> 01:03:02,854
This looks like the exhaust
system from an F-27.

566
01:03:03,193 --> 01:03:05,559
No. It's the prototype
for Robo's flight pack.

567
01:03:05,729 --> 01:03:09,256
The funding ran out
before we got a chance to test it.

568
01:03:09,399 --> 01:03:12,596
- How do you know so much about it?
- I designed it.

569
01:03:15,238 --> 01:03:19,197
Well, looks like the odds
on the home team just went up.

570
01:03:36,726 --> 01:03:39,354
What I've done
is programmed the command system...

571
01:03:39,529 --> 01:03:42,225
...to take its cues from your hard drive.

572
01:03:42,799 --> 01:03:45,734
I've also rigged it to work as
an auxiliary power unit.

573
01:03:46,069 --> 01:03:49,061
So if you ever have a power drain
like yesterday...

574
01:03:49,239 --> 01:03:53,437
...just interface with the flight pack
and recharge whether you fly or not.

575
01:03:54,210 --> 01:03:56,337
Nikko, see those resistors over there?

576
01:03:56,513 --> 01:03:58,276
Get them for me, will you?

577
01:03:58,448 --> 01:03:59,608
<i>Get them for me, will you?</i>

578
01:04:04,854 --> 01:04:06,651
<i>Get them for me.</i>

579
01:04:07,791 --> 01:04:09,383
<i>Promise me.</i>

580
01:04:11,828 --> 01:04:13,386
<i>Get them for me.</i>

581
01:04:14,864 --> 01:04:16,491
<i>Promise me.</i>

582
01:04:28,211 --> 01:04:29,542
What's going on?

583
01:04:30,146 --> 01:04:31,272
Excuse me.

584
01:04:34,484 --> 01:04:35,712
Hey, where you going?

585
01:04:37,220 --> 01:04:39,313
Unfinished business.

586
01:04:45,462 --> 01:04:47,293
It's okay. He'll be back.

587
01:04:47,464 --> 01:04:49,125
He needs us too.

588
01:04:50,333 --> 01:04:51,425
Where's he going?

589
01:04:53,336 --> 01:04:54,803
To keep a promise.

590
01:04:56,072 --> 01:04:59,132
You got a Robocop.
You got an alien cop?

591
01:04:59,609 --> 01:05:02,169
- Got a ghost cop?
- I don't have time for...

592
01:05:02,345 --> 01:05:03,744
You got a vampire cop?

593
01:05:09,352 --> 01:05:12,344
- Murphy.
- Good evening, Sergeant Reed.

594
01:05:12,689 --> 01:05:15,487
Do you know there's a warrant
out for your arrest?

595
01:05:15,725 --> 01:05:16,749
Yes.

596
01:05:17,060 --> 01:05:19,620
I was just checking.
What can I do for you?

597
01:05:19,796 --> 01:05:22,822
Please direct me
to the Rehab Staging Area.

598
01:05:23,166 --> 01:05:26,067
It's down the hall.
You can't miss it.

599
01:05:26,736 --> 01:05:27,703
Thank you.

600
01:05:32,675 --> 01:05:35,235
You may want to call
the fire department.

601
01:05:46,356 --> 01:05:48,153
- You got a light?
- Sure, man.

602
01:05:48,324 --> 01:05:49,882
Allow me, scum.

603
01:06:21,791 --> 01:06:22,780
Oh, shit.

604
01:06:39,342 --> 01:06:40,707
Where's McDaggett?

605
01:06:56,826 --> 01:06:59,454
<i>That does not look like
a police station.</i>

606
01:06:59,629 --> 01:07:02,154
You're damn right
I'm not at the station.

607
01:07:02,332 --> 01:07:05,529
If my spy hadrt warned me,
I'd be dead now.

608
01:07:06,169 --> 01:07:09,627
I thought your damn ninja was
supposed to take care of Robocop.

609
01:07:09,806 --> 01:07:14,266
That's the deal. I clear the area,
he keeps the robot off my back.

610
01:07:14,844 --> 01:07:18,109
<i>You have the device I sent you?</i>

611
01:07:22,318 --> 01:07:25,344
It hasn't come to that yet.
And it won't. Relax.

612
01:07:25,522 --> 01:07:29,822
<i>It is difficult for me to continue
our business relationship...</i>

613
01:07:30,126 --> 01:07:32,287
<i>...when I don't know your methods.</i>

614
01:07:32,629 --> 01:07:35,120
You don't need to know my methods.

615
01:07:35,298 --> 01:07:38,665
I said I'll clear the area
and I'll clear it.

616
01:07:39,636 --> 01:07:43,265
Just get the robot cop off my back.

617
01:07:55,785 --> 01:08:00,415
I understand you're willing to pay good
money to know where the rebel base is.

618
01:08:00,590 --> 01:08:01,579
Yes, well...

619
01:08:03,693 --> 01:08:05,217
...the money's good...

620
01:08:06,696 --> 01:08:07,822
...if the tip's good.

621
01:08:13,770 --> 01:08:16,864
The last tip saved your ass,
didn't it?

622
01:08:34,490 --> 01:08:36,151
What do we have here?

623
01:08:37,126 --> 01:08:38,616
You don't like men in uniform?

624
01:08:38,795 --> 01:08:41,662
My dad lost his job.
I just need some money.

625
01:08:41,831 --> 01:08:45,198
- We've got lots of money, honey.
- Don't.

626
01:08:45,768 --> 01:08:48,168
- No!
- She said, "No. "

627
01:08:50,773 --> 01:08:53,071
Maybe you have a hearing problem?

628
01:08:58,147 --> 01:08:59,444
Go home, young lady.

629
01:09:00,717 --> 01:09:02,685
You are in violation of curfew.

630
01:09:14,230 --> 01:09:15,527
Where's McDaggett?

631
01:09:19,068 --> 01:09:20,365
Room 212.

632
01:09:20,570 --> 01:09:21,628
Thank you.

633
01:09:22,739 --> 01:09:24,570
I hope you are insured.

634
01:09:26,276 --> 01:09:27,766
Elevator door sticks!

635
01:09:48,431 --> 01:09:49,455
Don't.

636
01:10:02,145 --> 01:10:04,705
I have a message from officer Lewis.

637
01:10:20,797 --> 01:10:22,094
Stop!

638
01:10:24,567 --> 01:10:25,693
Drive!

639
01:10:26,436 --> 01:10:28,301
I said, drive, goddamn it, drive!

640
01:10:37,413 --> 01:10:41,372
My time, my money. I told you
and won't tell you again, understand?

641
01:10:41,551 --> 01:10:44,850
I must commandeer your vehicle
for police use.

642
01:10:45,188 --> 01:10:47,315
What is your problem, sucker?

643
01:10:50,159 --> 01:10:51,820
I mean, officer.

644
01:12:02,698 --> 01:12:03,665
Cover me.

645
01:12:56,219 --> 01:12:57,618
Commander!

646
01:13:20,476 --> 01:13:22,569
What's the deal?

647
01:13:34,390 --> 01:13:36,688
Where the hell is Robocop?

648
01:13:38,394 --> 01:13:41,488
We could drive around
and listen for explosions.

649
01:13:49,238 --> 01:13:50,227
Are you doing that?

650
01:13:50,406 --> 01:13:53,603
I got tired of splicing wires,
so I put in a pulse tach decoder.

651
01:13:53,776 --> 01:13:55,607
- Telemetric?
- No.

652
01:13:55,778 --> 01:13:59,077
- Smart ass.
- I know you are, but what am I?

653
01:13:59,749 --> 01:14:01,273
Here, let me try.

654
01:14:12,194 --> 01:14:14,287
Thanks for the heart attack.

655
01:14:14,463 --> 01:14:17,830
I believe I will go
and send out a recon team.

656
01:14:18,367 --> 01:14:20,096
I got a better idea.

657
01:14:20,870 --> 01:14:23,464
Why don't we just all have a seat.

658
01:14:24,273 --> 01:14:25,501
And relax.

659
01:14:26,075 --> 01:14:28,373
It'll all be over in a few minutes.

660
01:14:28,711 --> 01:14:31,077
You son of a bitch.

661
01:14:31,314 --> 01:14:33,714
Watch the language,
there's children present.

662
01:14:37,653 --> 01:14:39,245
Drop it, Coontz.

663
01:14:41,624 --> 01:14:44,491
I'm not going to ask twice.

664
01:14:49,832 --> 01:14:53,097
What do you mean, "it'll all be over
in a few minutes"?

665
01:14:56,172 --> 01:14:58,402
Get the kids out of here! Now!

666
01:15:12,688 --> 01:15:14,280
Bertha!

667
01:15:19,161 --> 01:15:20,128
Go.

668
01:15:23,699 --> 01:15:25,690
- Got to get her.
- Go!

669
01:15:27,436 --> 01:15:29,131
Come on, let's go! Come on!

670
01:15:49,358 --> 01:15:50,586
Come on.

671
01:15:55,398 --> 01:15:57,389
Come on! Get in! Come on!

672
01:15:59,869 --> 01:16:00,836
Come on!

673
01:16:04,473 --> 01:16:05,462
Okay, now go!

674
01:16:06,242 --> 01:16:09,268
- Go on!
- No, it's happening again!

675
01:16:09,445 --> 01:16:11,345
Don't let them take you away.

676
01:16:17,653 --> 01:16:19,314
I said, go! Get out of here!

677
01:16:35,504 --> 01:16:36,630
Where is he?

678
01:16:39,275 --> 01:16:40,264
Go to hell.

679
01:16:40,676 --> 01:16:42,405
Take her to headquarters.

680
01:16:42,611 --> 01:16:45,546
I promise my men won't leave
a mark on you.

681
01:16:51,187 --> 01:16:54,384
Sir. What about our friend Coontz?

682
01:16:55,524 --> 01:16:58,550
If we'd let him live,
we'd have to have paid him.

683
01:17:08,170 --> 01:17:11,469
We're talking about hundreds
of thousands of dollars in damage.

684
01:17:11,640 --> 01:17:14,666
- Murphy can be rough on properties.
- Yeah. Well...

685
01:17:14,844 --> 01:17:18,211
...every cent of it will be coming out
of your salaries.

686
01:17:18,581 --> 01:17:20,640
Hey! You built him!

687
01:17:28,691 --> 01:17:30,352
We're taking Cadillac Heights.

688
01:17:31,060 --> 01:17:35,258
I'll need 50 of your men armed and in full
body armor in one hour. Johnson...

689
01:17:35,464 --> 01:17:40,163
...tell the CEo the demolition crews will
have access at 0600 hours tomorrow.

690
01:17:40,336 --> 01:17:43,772
Hey, we don't do that kind of work.

691
01:17:44,073 --> 01:17:46,234
That was a direct order, sergeant.

692
01:17:46,442 --> 01:17:49,775
Driving people out of their homes
is no work for a cop!

693
01:17:50,112 --> 01:17:51,272
Now, sergeant.

694
01:17:52,648 --> 01:17:56,277
Fifteen years on the force
is quite an investment.

695
01:17:56,485 --> 01:17:58,248
Your job, your pension.

696
01:17:58,554 --> 01:18:03,150
Maybe instead of worrying about these
squatters, think about your own family.

697
01:18:04,293 --> 01:18:05,487
I am.

698
01:18:14,503 --> 01:18:17,370
I'm thinking I have to go home
and face them.

699
01:18:33,689 --> 01:18:35,316
You can't do this.

700
01:18:38,360 --> 01:18:41,158
You are employees of oCP!

701
01:18:41,330 --> 01:18:42,524
Now remember that.

702
01:18:44,433 --> 01:18:47,402
You're jeopardizing
your retirement benefits!

703
01:19:00,416 --> 01:19:01,474
Stop that man.

704
01:19:07,256 --> 01:19:10,225
How would you and your friends
like to make some money?

705
01:19:22,705 --> 01:19:23,637
<i>- It's...
- Johnny...</i>

706
01:19:23,806 --> 01:19:25,171
<i>- Rehab!
- Hurray!</i>

707
01:19:40,189 --> 01:19:44,148
<i>Johnny Rehab action figures, parts
and accessories all sold separately.</i>

708
01:19:45,194 --> 01:19:47,389
<i>Three nuns and five clergy are dead...</i>

709
01:19:47,563 --> 01:19:51,761
<i>...in what is believed to be the latest
atrocity by the killer cyborg, Robocop.</i>

710
01:19:52,201 --> 01:19:54,260
<i>The OCP claim the former police unit...</i>

711
01:19:54,436 --> 01:19:57,303
<i>...is responsible for a spree
of terrorism...</i>

712
01:19:57,473 --> 01:20:01,307
<i>...in the Cadillac Heights section
of Old Detroit.</i>

713
01:20:02,211 --> 01:20:04,236
<i>I'm sorry, I can't even read this.</i>

714
01:20:05,347 --> 01:20:07,747
<i>This is bullshit!
Are you buying this?</i>

715
01:20:08,884 --> 01:20:12,217
Are you kidding me? Robocop?

716
01:21:14,183 --> 01:21:15,480
Marie.

717
01:21:28,697 --> 01:21:30,289
Lousy sons of bitches!

718
01:21:31,200 --> 01:21:34,601
<i>- OCP bastards!
- Nobody is listening to you, sweetheart.</i>

719
01:21:37,740 --> 01:21:39,207
<i>We are in position.</i>

720
01:21:39,375 --> 01:21:43,311
This is Big Stick. You have a green.
Arm and proceed to strike zone.

721
01:21:44,079 --> 01:21:46,274
<i>All teams, we have a green.</i>

722
01:21:46,482 --> 01:21:49,110
<i>All teams, we have a green.</i>

723
01:21:50,152 --> 01:21:51,551
Hey, take it easy.

724
01:22:15,811 --> 01:22:18,803
- So what now?
- What now?

725
01:22:19,214 --> 01:22:22,706
- Game's over, Moreno. Just shut up.
- What about Bertha's plan?

726
01:22:23,352 --> 01:22:25,377
Damn it! Bertha's dead!

727
01:22:28,690 --> 01:22:30,317
I'm sorry.

728
01:22:54,283 --> 01:22:56,581
Folks, in about 45 minutes...

729
01:22:56,718 --> 01:23:00,085
...the Rehabs are coming
to blow you out of your neighborhood.

730
01:23:00,255 --> 01:23:01,654
I want you to take your kids...

731
01:23:01,857 --> 01:23:05,315
...and anybody who shouldn't be fighting
to the basement!

732
01:23:06,061 --> 01:23:10,191
The rest of you are hereby deputized
by the Detroit Police Department.

733
01:23:12,167 --> 01:23:15,068
It's time to show
how real cops kick ass.

734
01:24:31,313 --> 01:24:34,578
Detroit Police! Identify yourself.

735
01:24:39,788 --> 01:24:42,484
You are under arrest
for assaulting an officer.

736
01:24:53,468 --> 01:24:56,164
And destruction of police property.

737
01:25:37,312 --> 01:25:38,370
Quiet!

738
01:25:38,547 --> 01:25:39,741
Quiet!

739
01:25:43,619 --> 01:25:47,851
Hold your fire
until absolutely necessary.

740
01:27:15,277 --> 01:27:16,301
Commander...

741
01:27:16,478 --> 01:27:19,709
...Detroit Police are out there, sir.
They're fighting against us.

742
01:27:19,881 --> 01:27:22,714
So? We have a schedule to keep.

743
01:27:22,884 --> 01:27:26,581
We don't fire on police officers!
You're out of line, McDaggett.

744
01:27:26,755 --> 01:27:29,189
I'm in charge here. I'm pulling the plug.

745
01:27:29,591 --> 01:27:30,717
Sit down.

746
01:27:31,093 --> 01:27:32,492
Have you gone war-wacky?

747
01:27:36,164 --> 01:27:39,327
I said, sit down.

748
01:27:42,070 --> 01:27:43,196
Good idea.

749
01:27:50,245 --> 01:27:51,735
How are we getting out of here anyway?

750
01:27:56,118 --> 01:27:58,177
How'd you get...? Never mind.

751
01:27:58,353 --> 01:28:00,082
Is there a transmission dish outside?

752
01:28:00,255 --> 01:28:03,656
Yeah, and I was just watching
the Media Break guy pick his nose.

753
01:28:03,825 --> 01:28:05,759
Do you have your computer with you?

754
01:28:10,465 --> 01:28:11,796
<i>People of Detroit...</i>

755
01:28:12,200 --> 01:28:15,692
<i>...this is an illegal broadcast.
It may be cut off at any time.</i>

756
01:28:15,871 --> 01:28:17,532
<i>So listen to me.</i>

757
01:28:17,706 --> 01:28:19,640
<i>OCP is lying to you.</i>

758
01:28:19,808 --> 01:28:22,368
<i>They're destroying people's lives

759
01:28:26,815 --> 01:28:28,442
<i>Those Rehabs you see on TV...</i>

760
01:28:28,650 --> 01:28:33,178
<i>...they're mercenaries hired by OCP
to throw people out of their homes.</i>

761
01:28:41,830 --> 01:28:43,730
<i>You've got to believe me.</i>

762
01:28:44,466 --> 01:28:47,401
<i>I'm speaking for all the homeless

763
01:28:47,569 --> 01:28:51,733
<i>...and every city like it run by
heartless capitalist scumbags...</i>

764

OCP cares about...</i>

unless you fight back now.</i>

766

<i>Time's running out. OCP's the enemy.</i>

767
01:29:18,400 --> 01:29:23,360
<i>I repeat. Time is running out.
OCP is the enemy.</i>

768
01:29:23,772 --> 01:29:26,206
<i>Help us. Innocent people are dying.</i>

769
01:29:56,071 --> 01:29:58,096
- More ammo!
- More ammo!

770
01:30:19,761 --> 01:30:20,750
Zack's hit!

771
01:30:26,835 --> 01:30:29,360
They're winning, aren't they, sergeant?

772
01:30:40,849 --> 01:30:42,578
What in the name...?

773
01:31:12,147 --> 01:31:13,409
Sir?

774
01:31:27,495 --> 01:31:30,089
Splatter that, you sons of bitches!

775
01:31:49,084 --> 01:31:50,483
<i>Come in, Big Stick.</i>

776
01:31:54,623 --> 01:31:57,114
All right, Mr. Robocop.

777
01:31:57,359 --> 01:31:58,656
Come and get me.

778
01:32:02,831 --> 01:32:04,355
Get away from the door.

779
01:32:18,713 --> 01:32:20,237
Think it over.

780
01:32:22,250 --> 01:32:25,276
Oh, my God, Johnson,
our stock has dropped to nothing.

781
01:32:25,553 --> 01:32:26,645
We're ruined.

782
01:32:45,640 --> 01:32:47,733
How may I help you, officer?

783
01:32:48,243 --> 01:32:49,870
By resisting arrest.

784
01:32:50,211 --> 01:32:52,111
Don't count on it, chum.

785
01:32:52,514 --> 01:32:54,414
Anyway, what's the charge?

786
01:32:54,582 --> 01:32:57,244
The murder of Anne Lewis.

787
01:32:59,187 --> 01:33:01,712
Dead or alive, you're coming with me.

788
01:33:28,883 --> 01:33:33,843
McDaggett, you can have oCP.
It's all yours. Sayonara.

789
01:33:34,189 --> 01:33:35,679
Where're you going?

790
01:33:35,857 --> 01:33:37,791
You're gonna miss all the fun.

791
01:34:25,740 --> 01:34:28,607
No flashy bravery, tin man.

792
01:34:28,777 --> 01:34:30,836
Or the two cuties say, "Bye-bye. "

793
01:34:31,379 --> 01:34:33,142
What are you doing?

794
01:34:33,314 --> 01:34:34,713
What are you doing?

795
01:34:42,857 --> 01:34:45,189
Stop them! Stop them!

796
01:34:54,836 --> 01:34:57,066
Stupid fools!

797
01:34:57,238 --> 01:34:59,729
Don't you know what you've done to us?!

798
01:35:00,775 --> 01:35:04,074
Those androids are programmed
with a thermal fail-safe device.

799
01:35:05,713 --> 01:35:07,442
You mean to self-destruct?

800
01:35:07,649 --> 01:35:10,277
In 15 seconds,
everything within 20 yards...

801
01:35:10,451 --> 01:35:12,851
...of where we're standing
will be atomized.

802
01:35:13,188 --> 01:35:15,554
We're dead, you stupid slag.

803
01:35:15,723 --> 01:35:18,191
Don't count on it, chum.

804
01:35:27,435 --> 01:35:29,164
Hang on.

805
01:35:52,827 --> 01:35:56,126
- Come on.
- Let me give you a hand.

806
01:36:23,691 --> 01:36:26,159
Kanemitsu-san...

807
01:36:26,361 --> 01:36:28,329
...I realize that it looks bad...

808
01:36:28,496 --> 01:36:31,363
...but maybe our plans were
over-ambitious.

809
01:36:31,532 --> 01:36:34,092
Let's start a skoshy bit smaller.

810
01:36:34,269 --> 01:36:37,864
Let's gentrify this neighborhood.
Build strip malls.

811
01:36:38,206 --> 01:36:42,199
Fast-food chains. Lots of popular
entertainment. What do you think?

812
01:36:48,182 --> 01:36:49,672
- What did he say?
- You're fired.

813
01:37:19,480 --> 01:37:21,505
I got to hand it to you.

814
01:37:22,684 --> 01:37:24,276
What do they call you?

815
01:37:24,752 --> 01:37:26,720
Murphy, is it?

816
01:37:26,788 --> 01:37:29,086
My friends call me Murphy.

817
01:37:32,360 --> 01:37:33,759
You call me...

818
01:37:34,062 --> 01:37:35,393
...Robocop.

819
01:37:36,393 --> 01:37:46,393
