1
00:01:07,931 --> 00:01:10,709
They call it the Dragon Age...

2
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:15,564
a time of political strife,
savage beasts and powerful magic...

3
00:01:15,565 --> 00:01:20,582
but also a time of faith...
faith in the Chantry of Andraste,

4
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:26,144
a dominant religious order led
by her holiness, the Divine...

5
00:01:26,145 --> 00:01:29,994
Her Templar knights exert
harsh control over the Mages,

6
00:01:29,995 --> 00:01:32,071
restricting the
practice of the arcane

7
00:01:32,072 --> 00:01:34,146
magical arts they believe
have the potential

8
00:01:34,147 --> 00:01:36,924
to unleash a blight upon the world...

9
00:01:36,925 --> 00:01:40,439
The most dangerous of these are
the Blood Mages who continue

10
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:45,457
to perform their dark rituals in secret...
in defiance of the Chantry.

11
00:01:45,564 --> 00:01:48,609
Determined to neutralize
this threat at any cost,

12
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:52,928
the Templar's methods become
more brutal and their suspicions rise,

13
00:01:52,929 --> 00:01:56,812
even extending to the
loyal Circle of Magi...

14
00:01:56,813 --> 00:02:01,633
Corruption infects the Templar ranks
as the leadership sees their role shift

15
00:02:01,634 --> 00:02:04,880
from control and protection...
to suppression.

16
00:02:04,881 --> 00:02:09,467
As tensions boil within the Chantry,
the balance of power has been maintained

17
00:02:09,468 --> 00:02:13,686
by the Seekers, the finest
and most loyal of the Templars

18
00:02:13,687 --> 00:02:16,565
Handpicked by the Divine herself...

19
00:02:16,566 --> 00:02:21,454
these defenders of truth root out
corruption, wherever it may be found,

20
00:02:21,455 --> 00:02:25,940
be it from rogue Mages, or within
the halls of the Chantry itself.

21
00:02:25,941 --> 00:02:29,389
Now the Ten Year
"Gathering of the Faithful" looms,

22
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:31,898
and pilgrims from all corners
of the world journey

23
00:02:31,899 --> 00:02:34,407
to the Orlaisian Empire
to pray for peace...

24
00:02:35,081 --> 00:02:40,070
A peace that those in the
shadows are plotting to shatter.

25
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:06,940
Brothers!

26
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:11,940
A new era for Mages everywhere is about to begin!

27
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:24,970
Now, Avexis, the time has come to join our cause.

28
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:08,320
Keep your focus, Cassandra.

29
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,240
Don't let your fury run away with you again.

30
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:14,930
I know, Byron.

31
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:17,040
Trust in the Maker.

32
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:29,180
It's useless to resist, Avexis.

33
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:31,950
Drink.. Drink your destiny...

34
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:33,590
Brother Frenic...

35
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:36,230
If she drinks any more, it will kill her..

36
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:42,980
I will decide when she's had enough. Is that understood?!

37
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:50,380
For the Chantry!

38
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:53,450
For the Chantry!

39
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:11,180
Ha!

40
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:44,660
Now, release it!

41
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:06,350
Enough, Cassandra! Gather your wits. We have work to do.

42
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:14,830
I'll draw its eye. Don't keep me waiting!

43
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:18,700
Hey!

44
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:22,610
That's right! Come on! Come and get me!

45
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,650
There's nowhere left to run, Mage.

46
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:56,000
Release the girl and submit!

47
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:00,940
Make way!

48
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:10,010
You're from one of the dragon-hunting clans.

49
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:12,180
It seems I'm outmatched...

50
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:22,000
Spineless Blood Mage!

51
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:53,410
You may rise.

52
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:58,740
We applaud your recent efforts, High Seeker.

53
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:03,080
However, your report also raises many concerns.

54
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:07,760
To think this is all happening so close to the Ten Year Gathering...

55
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,030
Surely it is not a coincidence.

56
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:15,670
We're already taking extra precautions, Most Holy.

57
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:18,550
So you managed to bring back a little Blood Mage girl?

58
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:23,210
Avexis is not a Blood Mage, Your Grace.

59
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:26,220
She was taken from the Circle of Magi.

60
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:32,760
It's true. She went missing from the Circle a few weeks ago.

61
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:36,970
Presumably kidnapped. We've been searching for her since.

62
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:41,700
I am most grateful for her rescue, High Seeker.

63
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,810
We will come for her soon.

64
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:48,080
I'm afraid I cannot allow that, First Enchanter.

65
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,380
And why not?

66
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:52,980
She was the focus of the ritual,

67
00:09:52,837 --> 00:09:57,024
and is obviously vital to whatever
the Blood Mages are planning.

68
00:09:57,025 --> 00:10:02,016
She will remain in my custody
until we get to the bottom of this.

69
00:10:09,394 --> 00:10:12,976
Did the Seekers really bring down a drake?

70
00:10:12,977 --> 00:10:16,664
Yes, Your Reverence. It was Cassandra.

71
00:10:17,764 --> 00:10:21,312
You are to be commended
for your exceptional bravery.

72
00:10:21,313 --> 00:10:23,756
I would expect nothing
less from a Pentaghast.

73
00:10:23,757 --> 00:10:26,473
Your family's dragon-hunting
skills are legendary.

74
00:10:27,539 --> 00:10:32,556
You honor us, Grand Cleric.
We are proud to serve the Chantry.

75
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:37,983
You have my praise as well, High Seeker.

76
00:10:37,984 --> 00:10:42,608
Another notable success
by your loyal order.

77
00:10:44,076 --> 00:10:46,584
However, it seems rather
reckless to risk your

78
00:10:46,585 --> 00:10:49,093
small numbers against
Blood Mage ceremonies.

79
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:56,305
Perhaps if you shared your intelligence,
my Templars could better assist you.

80
00:10:57,501 --> 00:11:03,129
There are times when stealth and
discretion are more valuable than numbers.

81
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:08,514
Are you implying you don't
trust us to act with discretion?

82
00:11:08,515 --> 00:11:12,029
Ensuring that you do is one of our duties.

83
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:14,138
Or have you forgotten, Knight Commander?

84
00:11:18,335 --> 00:11:21,576
Gentlemen, remember where you are.

85
00:11:23,569 --> 00:11:26,568
My deepest apologies, Your Holiness.

86
00:11:26,569 --> 00:11:31,447
With your permission, we shall take our
leave and return to our investigation.

87
00:11:58,177 --> 00:12:01,951
Such violence before
bed will give you nightmares.

88
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:13,921
Let's see what you've got!

89
00:13:04,457 --> 00:13:07,590
There's nothing left for me
to teach you about swordplay.

90
00:13:07,591 --> 00:13:10,524
I know no man tougher
than you with a blade.

91
00:13:10,525 --> 00:13:13,391
But you just bested me.

92
00:13:13,392 --> 00:13:17,359
Yes, but you weren't fighting
with everything you have, were you?

93
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:22,356
Perhaps, but you had me completely
at your mercy with that final move.

94
00:13:22,761 --> 00:13:27,637
Sometimes your blade becomes your shield
and your shield becomes your blade.

95
00:13:30,363 --> 00:13:33,729
Your prejudice misleads
yourjudgment, Cassandra.

96
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:37,529
To see the truth, you must look
through the eyes of your heart,

97
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:39,897
and not just the ones in your head.

98
00:13:39,898 --> 00:13:43,307
Not everything is what it
appears on the surface.

99
00:13:44,898 --> 00:13:49,894
Sorry, I must sound just
like a father lecturing his child.

100
00:13:50,466 --> 00:13:53,071
I'd be proud to have you as a father.

101
00:13:55,034 --> 00:13:56,910
Good night, Byron.

102
00:14:15,372 --> 00:14:19,871
One of the Circle of Magi dogs
was able to sniff out our ritual.

103
00:14:19,872 --> 00:14:23,272
However, its purpose still eludes them.

104
00:14:23,273 --> 00:14:28,582
As long as we get Avexis back,
we can proceed as planned.

105
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:32,949
It's far too dangerous to
continue meeting like this.

106
00:14:35,476 --> 00:14:40,472
Here. This is a rare Elven Stone
you can use to communicate with me.

107
00:14:40,977 --> 00:14:43,442
Keep it on your person at all times.

108
00:14:43,443 --> 00:14:45,877
Should you discover any
more useful information,

109
00:14:45,878 --> 00:14:49,745
my Mages and I will be ready to act.

110
00:14:49,746 --> 00:14:53,379
Victory will be ours.

111
00:15:56,793 --> 00:15:59,325
Byron! What are you doing?

112
00:15:59,326 --> 00:16:01,092
There's no time to explain.

113
00:16:01,093 --> 00:16:03,293
Go back to your quarters
and forget what you've seen here.

114
00:16:03,294 --> 00:16:05,893
That's not what you trained me to do.

115
00:16:05,894 --> 00:16:09,794
I trained you to follow orders. Now go!

116
00:16:09,795 --> 00:16:11,398
Byron;

117
00:16:20,664 --> 00:16:22,764
Tell me where you're taking her.

118
00:16:22,765 --> 00:16:24,598
I can't say.

119
00:16:24,599 --> 00:16:26,731
I'm on an important mission.

120
00:16:26,732 --> 00:16:28,399
What is it?

121
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,673
I don't want to involve you in this.

122
00:16:33,834 --> 00:16:36,833
Raise the alarm! Men down!
There's been an intruder!

123
00:16:36,834 --> 00:16:39,300
Someone has taken the girl!
...Search the grounds!

124
00:16:39,301 --> 00:16:41,644
Find her!
...They can't have gotten far!

125
00:16:43,735 --> 00:16:45,679
Come on.

126
00:17:19,443 --> 00:17:21,909
Byron and Cassandra
have taken the girl!

127
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:24,143
Inform the High Seeker.

128
00:17:24,144 --> 00:17:26,777
The rest of you, follow me!

129
00:17:26,778 --> 00:17:29,484
Hya!

130
00:17:50,149 --> 00:17:51,753
We'll wait here.

131
00:17:56,351 --> 00:17:59,351
For what?

132
00:17:59,352 --> 00:18:01,785
Byron;

133
00:18:01,786 --> 00:18:06,585
Yes... I suppose
you're a part of this now...

134
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:11,582
I don't know all the details yet,
but I've been investigating a conspiracy.

135
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:15,365
That's how I found out about
the Blood Mage ceremony.

136
00:18:16,423 --> 00:18:19,655
Is the High Seeker aware of this?

137
00:18:19,656 --> 00:18:24,652
No... I fear the conspiracy goes
all the way to the Chantry.

138
00:18:24,857 --> 00:18:27,923
And you suspect the High Seeker?!

139
00:18:27,924 --> 00:18:31,590
I'm a Seeker.
I'm trained to suspect everyone.

140
00:18:31,591 --> 00:18:34,160
Do you even know
what you are suggesting?!

141
00:18:35,292 --> 00:18:37,658
<i>To doubt the High Seeker is...</i>

142
00:18:40,427 --> 00:18:44,460
This elf girl supposedly has
the ability to control wild beasts.

143
00:18:44,461 --> 00:18:47,027
That's why the Blood Mages wanted her.

144
00:18:47,028 --> 00:18:51,262
That's a rare power, but what
does it have to do with the conspiracy?

145
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:55,462
I don't know yet. But I'm convinced
she's the key to all of it.

146
00:18:55,463 --> 00:18:57,328
And because the High Seeker refused

147
00:18:57,329 --> 00:19:00,296
to return her to the Circle,
you think that means...?

148
00:19:00,297 --> 00:19:03,997
I'm not sure what
to think about any of it!

149
00:19:03,998 --> 00:19:07,532
For now, I'm taking Avexis
to a friend I know I can trust.

150
00:19:07,533 --> 00:19:11,376
Who? Tell me!

151
00:19:39,505 --> 00:19:42,439
Are these the friends you were waiting for?

152
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:47,442
We can't take on these numbers
and protect the girl. We must retreat.

153
00:19:52,675 --> 00:19:53,808
Go!

154
00:19:54,054 --> 00:19:55,722
Cassandra, wait!

155
00:19:58,059 --> 00:19:59,060
Hya!

156
00:20:32,143 --> 00:20:33,748
Behind you!

157
00:20:34,913 --> 00:20:36,655
Byron!

158
00:20:45,295 --> 00:20:48,099
I'll be taking what is mine, Seeker.

159
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:51,371
No... Avexis...

160
00:20:57,046 --> 00:20:59,618
Release her! Now!

161
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,290
Seeker reinforcements are approaching...

162
00:21:07,562 --> 00:21:11,068
Your comrades are
too late, Dragon Hunter...

163
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:16,312
This round... belongs to me...

164
00:21:20,714 --> 00:21:21,883
Byron;

165
00:21:33,067 --> 00:21:35,001
Go after them...

166
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:37,406
We must get Avexis back...

167
00:21:37,407 --> 00:21:39,409
The Chantry is in peril...

168
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:41,789
I should have listened to you...

169
00:21:43,348 --> 00:21:44,953
Cassandra...

170
00:21:46,587 --> 00:21:51,095
Hate can only breed more hate...

171
00:21:54,065 --> 00:21:55,636
Byron;

172
00:22:22,908 --> 00:22:25,075
Filthy murdering Mage!

173
00:22:25,076 --> 00:22:26,778
I-I'm not the one you want!

174
00:22:29,951 --> 00:22:32,922
Where did your
accomplices take Avexis?!

175
00:22:32,923 --> 00:22:35,659
Stop! You have the wrong person!

176
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:37,127
Silence, Blood Mage!

177
00:22:38,765 --> 00:22:41,199
No, I'm a Circle Mage,
not a Blood Mage!

178
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,511
A Mage is a Mage!

179
00:22:56,023 --> 00:22:57,390
There they are!

180
00:22:57,391 --> 00:23:01,205
Stand down! Lower your weapon, Cassandra!

181
00:23:04,669 --> 00:23:07,305
You have some explaining to do.

182
00:23:07,306 --> 00:23:08,808
He's dead!

183
00:23:08,809 --> 00:23:11,178
What?! What happened here? Talk!

184
00:23:11,178 --> 00:23:13,513
These Blood Mages killed Byron.

185
00:23:13,514 --> 00:23:16,184
I'm telling you, I had no
part in this, I swear it!

186
00:23:16,185 --> 00:23:17,686
Where's the girl?

187
00:23:17,687 --> 00:23:18,723
They took her.

188
00:23:18,724 --> 00:23:20,657
Or perhaps you gave her to them!

189
00:23:20,658 --> 00:23:24,163
Why did you and Byron
remove her from her guard?

190
00:23:24,164 --> 00:23:25,906
Talk, Cassandra!

191
00:23:27,102 --> 00:23:30,873
So be it. Take her into
custody! And the Mage as well!

192
00:23:30,874 --> 00:23:33,177
What?!

193
00:23:33,178 --> 00:23:35,681
Listen, we have to get Avexis
back as soon as possible.

194
00:23:35,682 --> 00:23:37,250
In danger!

195
00:23:37,251 --> 00:23:40,562
You had your chance.
Save it for the High Seeker.

196
00:23:54,476 --> 00:23:56,644
Byron came here to meet me.

197
00:23:56,645 --> 00:23:59,388
I promised him that I'd
take Avexis to a safe place.

198
00:24:05,626 --> 00:24:09,063
There's no way those Blood Mages
could've known to follow you here tonight.

199
00:24:09,064 --> 00:24:11,102
Not without spies on the inside.

200
00:24:14,906 --> 00:24:19,077
Byron suspected that someone within
the Chantry is behind a conspiracy.

201
00:24:19,078 --> 00:24:21,314
If he was right, and we let
these Seekers take us back,

202
00:24:21,315 --> 00:24:24,252
there's a good chance
we will be "silenced."

203
00:24:24,253 --> 00:24:26,022
Shut up, Mage!

204
00:24:26,023 --> 00:24:27,764
There a problem?

205
00:24:29,627 --> 00:24:31,768
Keep it down back there.

206
00:24:35,036 --> 00:24:38,273
Circle Mages have pledged
their allegiance to the Chantry.

207
00:24:38,274 --> 00:24:40,776
It's Blood Mages who are the opposition.

208
00:24:40,777 --> 00:24:45,024
Please don't assume I'm one of them,
but I can find out where they are.

209
00:24:48,857 --> 00:24:51,358
You said yourself
that if we don't get

210
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:53,859
Avexis back, something
terrible will happen.

211
00:24:54,297 --> 00:24:57,178
And Byron will have then
lost his life for nothing.

212
00:25:00,241 --> 00:25:03,313
Are you sure you know a way to find Avexis?

213
00:25:11,423 --> 00:25:14,527
Byron risked defying our
Order to protect her.

214
00:25:14,528 --> 00:25:18,843
It seems that if I am to discover
the truth, I will have to do the same.

215
00:25:23,373 --> 00:25:25,276
This man has a knife!

216
00:25:25,277 --> 00:25:27,179
What?!

217
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:30,583
Hm?
...What's going on over there?

218
00:25:30,584 --> 00:25:35,191
We told you to surrender
your weapons, Mage. Where is it?!

219
00:25:35,192 --> 00:25:37,360
No sudden moves! Search him!

220
00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:48,947
Impressive...

221
00:26:09,108 --> 00:26:11,613
Wait! They aren't pursuing us.

222
00:26:13,082 --> 00:26:15,250
You're pathetic!

223
00:26:16,953 --> 00:26:17,953
Whoa!

224
00:26:23,097 --> 00:26:24,599
Get off of me!

225
00:26:26,935 --> 00:26:28,637
Prefer the top, do you?

226
00:26:28,638 --> 00:26:30,338
Ah! Ah...

227
00:26:30,339 --> 00:26:32,183
Shut up!

228
00:26:37,183 --> 00:26:38,351
No! Wait!

229
00:26:40,454 --> 00:26:45,133
If you were of no use to me,
I'd cut you down here and now, Mage.

230
00:26:55,176 --> 00:26:56,911
But I forget my manners.

231
00:26:56,912 --> 00:26:59,414
Here I've rolled in the
bushes with a pretty

232
00:26:59,415 --> 00:27:01,914
young lady and I haven't
introduced myself.

233
00:27:02,154 --> 00:27:04,424
I am Regalyan d'Marcall.

234
00:27:04,425 --> 00:27:06,496
My friends call me Galyan.

235
00:27:14,004 --> 00:27:15,848
Well, "friend"...

236
00:27:17,776 --> 00:27:22,779
If you value your life, you will take me
to the Blood Mage that murdered Byron.

237
00:27:28,092 --> 00:27:31,871
That is all we
know at this time, Most Holy.

238
00:27:33,139 --> 00:27:35,147
This is unbelievable...

239
00:27:37,156 --> 00:27:39,575
A traitor amongst the Seekers?

240
00:27:40,702 --> 00:27:44,183
We are currently reviewing
all the facts, Your Reverence.

241
00:27:44,184 --> 00:27:45,789
It's unthinkable!

242
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:50,805
The Seekers are the most pure among us, yet
two of your own have betrayed the Chantry.

243
00:27:51,313 --> 00:27:54,558
A Seeker would never go
against the Chantry.

244
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:58,280
I assure you that their
actions can be explained.

245
00:27:59,947 --> 00:28:03,829
I have a company
of knights standing at the ready.

246
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:07,288
Permission to pursue the
traitors at once, Your Eminence.

247
00:28:08,515 --> 00:28:13,502
Perhaps the Seekers would be hesitant
to hunt down one of their own.

248
00:28:18,356 --> 00:28:21,702
Dispatch yourTemplars immediately.

249
00:28:21,703 --> 00:28:25,450
These renegades must be brought tojustice.

250
00:28:38,671 --> 00:28:41,113
There.

251
00:28:41,114 --> 00:28:43,423
Is this the Blood Mage hideout?

252
00:28:43,424 --> 00:28:45,935
A Circle safe house.

253
00:28:49,448 --> 00:28:51,389
A trap?!

254
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:54,506
Will you quit waving that thing around?

255
00:28:56,678 --> 00:28:59,522
My intelligence-gathering
associates meet here.

256
00:28:59,523 --> 00:29:02,233
If anyone can find where
the Blood Mages are, they can.

257
00:29:02,234 --> 00:29:04,341
More Mages just mean more trouble!

258
00:29:04,342 --> 00:29:06,350
You expect me to trust you?!

259
00:29:06,351 --> 00:29:08,965
Well, Byron trusted me!

260
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:13,879
Byron and I were friends.

261
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:17,304
I was the one who told him where the
Blood Mage ceremony would be held.

262
00:29:19,136 --> 00:29:23,452
The First Enchanter sent me to investigate
suspicious Blood Mage activities.

263
00:29:23,453 --> 00:29:27,703
It's thanks to the intelligence we gathered
that Byron was able to rescue Avexis.

264
00:29:27,704 --> 00:29:32,292
However, the plan fell apart when the High
Seeker did not return her to the Circle.

265
00:29:35,803 --> 00:29:37,643
I'm not sure the reason behind it,

266
00:29:37,644 --> 00:29:42,429
but that was when Byron started to
question the High Seeker's true intentions.

267
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:46,512
So Byron brought Avexis into the
forest tonight to give her to you...

268
00:29:46,513 --> 00:29:49,021
Yes.
She is a uniquely gifted girl.

269
00:29:49,022 --> 00:29:51,529
That's why I think the
Blood Mages abducted her.

270
00:29:51,903 --> 00:29:54,278
Byron and I planned on
hiding her here to keep her safe

271
00:29:54,279 --> 00:29:57,423
until we could get to the
bottom of the conspiracy.

272
00:29:57,424 --> 00:30:00,302
What?

273
00:30:00,303 --> 00:30:02,586
The horses are uneasy.

274
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:36,291
By the Maker...

275
00:30:43,009 --> 00:30:46,757
You knew these men?

276
00:30:46,758 --> 00:30:48,607
Loki...

277
00:31:06,671 --> 00:31:08,179
Haydn

278
00:31:09,717 --> 00:31:12,628
What happened? Who did this?!

279
00:31:12,629 --> 00:31:15,072
Blood Mages...

280
00:31:15,073 --> 00:31:20,088
They caught us just as we
returned from Lazarro's...

281
00:31:22,234 --> 00:31:23,776
Haydn

282
00:31:28,092 --> 00:31:30,101
Be at peace, my friend...

283
00:31:31,673 --> 00:31:33,352
Who's Lazarro?

284
00:31:36,626 --> 00:31:40,307
An information trader from a
village just outside of Montfort.

285
00:31:40,308 --> 00:31:42,985
He's the one who told me
about the dragon ceremony.

286
00:31:42,986 --> 00:31:44,527
Take me to him.

287
00:31:49,178 --> 00:31:51,461
We'll find out everything he knows!

288
00:31:52,927 --> 00:31:55,779
The Blood Mages may already
be waiting for us, you know.

289
00:31:57,913 --> 00:32:00,663
They've been one step ahead of us this far.

290
00:32:02,766 --> 00:32:04,306
Hyah!

291
00:32:06,248 --> 00:32:07,856
Be ready.

292
00:32:12,338 --> 00:32:14,781
You work close
to the edge of Chantry law,

293
00:32:14,782 --> 00:32:17,291
but still claim you are
loyal to the Circle?

294
00:32:17,292 --> 00:32:21,140
Contrary to common belief, not all
Mages wish to see the Chantry deposed.

295
00:32:21,141 --> 00:32:25,524
Those of us within the Circle seek only to
be treated with equal dignity and respect.

296
00:32:25,525 --> 00:32:29,842
I do my part to help ensure our efforts
are not undermined by the actions of a few.

297
00:32:29,843 --> 00:32:33,925
So you formed a network
to keep tabs on rogue Mages?

298
00:32:33,926 --> 00:32:36,469
Apostates like those in
this blood cult we're dealing with

299
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:38,477
might claim to act in the cause of freedom,

300
00:32:38,478 --> 00:32:41,891
but more often their only aim
is seizing power for themselves.

301
00:32:41,892 --> 00:32:45,438
I'd think it would benefit
the Circle to have Mages in power.

302
00:32:45,439 --> 00:32:48,954
Not like these.
That wouldn't be good for anyone.

303
00:32:56,618 --> 00:32:58,725
Search teams one and two have reported in.

304
00:32:58,726 --> 00:33:02,881
There's been no sign of Cassandra
or the Mage in the lgrecia Forest, sir.

305
00:33:09,077 --> 00:33:11,218
Has there been any word from Galyan?

306
00:33:11,219 --> 00:33:13,427
I'm afraid not, First Enchanter.

307
00:33:13,428 --> 00:33:17,275
We must find him
before the Seekers orTemplars do...

308
00:33:17,276 --> 00:33:19,686
Understood. I will take
charge of the search myself.

309
00:33:19,687 --> 00:33:21,962
I leave it to you, then.

310
00:33:21,963 --> 00:33:24,781
I only pray we are not too late.

311
00:33:39,173 --> 00:33:43,421
You can't see it from here, but Lazarro's
house is halfway up this cliff.

312
00:33:43,422 --> 00:33:47,371
He's an elf recluse.
Half-mad, but he hears things.

313
00:33:47,372 --> 00:33:50,282
No one knows how.

314
00:33:50,283 --> 00:33:52,491
He's also quite paranoid.

315
00:33:52,492 --> 00:33:55,001
How can we get in?

316
00:33:55,002 --> 00:33:58,186
Well, you could always try
asking to send down a ladder.

317
00:34:23,117 --> 00:34:25,124
Lazarro!

318
00:34:25,125 --> 00:34:26,734
It's me, Ga lya n!

319
00:34:28,372 --> 00:34:30,585
Lazarro! Are you there?

320
00:34:51,666 --> 00:34:53,339
Laza rro, ca I m down!

321
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:55,017
Wejust need some information!

322
00:35:01,204 --> 00:35:06,123
If you cooperate and tell us what you know,
I'll let you keep your filthy head!

323
00:35:06,124 --> 00:35:09,135
I know nothing! I'm not involved!

324
00:35:09,136 --> 00:35:11,580
Cassandra! Please...

325
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,733
Where is the girl?

326
00:35:16,734 --> 00:35:18,900
What? What girl?

327
00:35:18,901 --> 00:35:23,336
Perhaps you can't hear well.
Let me clear your ears for you.

328
00:35:24,938 --> 00:35:26,971
Frenic! Frenic has her!

329
00:35:26,972 --> 00:35:28,104
Who's Frenic?

330
00:35:28,105 --> 00:35:32,007
The leader of the Blood Mages.
He needs her... Needs her power!

331
00:35:32,008 --> 00:35:34,111
For what? What is he planning to do?!

332
00:35:35,576 --> 00:35:39,977
Attack... T-Ten Year...

333
00:35:39,978 --> 00:35:42,778
Frenic is going to attack
the Ten Year Gathering?

334
00:35:42,779 --> 00:35:45,179
Who is his accomplice in the Chantry?

335
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:46,446
Someone high up...!

336
00:35:46,447 --> 00:35:47,980
What's their name?

337
00:35:47,981 --> 00:35:50,815
I don't know!
...Who is it?! Talk!

338
00:35:52,184 --> 00:35:54,649
I am only going
to ask you one more time.

339
00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:58,451
Give me the name. Now!

340
00:35:58,452 --> 00:36:00,021
No, you don't!

341
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:04,086
This is a vial of Nesium Suspension.

342
00:36:04,087 --> 00:36:06,123
It emits a bright flash when shattered.

343
00:36:08,122 --> 00:36:11,257
So you think you can escape
using mere parlor tricks?!

344
00:36:11,258 --> 00:36:13,091
They'll kill me!

345
00:36:13,092 --> 00:36:14,959
"They"? You mean the Blood Mages?

346
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,492
I was to alert them if you showed up!

347
00:36:17,493 --> 00:36:20,361
Sorry, we can't let you do that.

348
00:36:20,362 --> 00:36:22,128
It's too late.

349
00:36:28,699 --> 00:36:31,432
What is that?

350
00:36:31,433 --> 00:36:33,640
I'm not sure I want to know...

351
00:37:01,813 --> 00:37:02,812
Hya!

352
00:37:39,329 --> 00:37:40,328
You all right?

353
00:37:40,329 --> 00:37:41,896
Of course I am.

354
00:38:00,572 --> 00:38:02,414
Oh, sod!

355
00:38:04,072 --> 00:38:06,711
The eyes...
Their minds are being controlled.

356
00:38:37,054 --> 00:38:38,691
There's too many!

357
00:39:13,237 --> 00:39:14,839
Yah!

358
00:39:20,006 --> 00:39:21,847
Not good...

359
00:39:24,908 --> 00:39:26,708
Thanks, Lazarro.

360
00:39:26,709 --> 00:39:31,122
Now... let's just hope this is
actually more than a parlor trick!

361
00:39:54,688 --> 00:39:57,854
I should be able to handle this pain!

362
00:39:57,855 --> 00:40:00,623
We need to get to a safe place
where I can treat your wound.

363
00:40:00,624 --> 00:40:02,728
I don't need your magic...!

364
00:40:04,091 --> 00:40:05,627
Are you all right?

365
00:40:09,293 --> 00:40:11,033
Sorry...

366
00:40:15,797 --> 00:40:19,963
It's hard for me to admit
I'm in your debt, Mage.

367
00:40:19,964 --> 00:40:23,240
My name isn't "Mage." It's Galyan.

368
00:40:26,301 --> 00:40:27,300
There they are!

369
00:40:35,772 --> 00:40:37,751
Why are You here?!

370
00:40:38,873 --> 00:40:39,872
<i>Hm.</i>

371
00:40:39,873 --> 00:40:42,443
After them! Arrest those traitors!

372
00:40:47,944 --> 00:40:49,651
Whoa!

373
00:40:52,778 --> 00:40:54,917
Get up! Don't let them escape!

374
00:41:11,821 --> 00:41:13,787
Oh, my.

375
00:41:15,055 --> 00:41:17,159
There's nowhere to run!

376
00:41:23,326 --> 00:41:26,960
Now surrender. Nice and easy.

377
00:41:26,961 --> 00:41:30,295
It seems we're out of options here...

378
00:41:30,296 --> 00:41:32,328
Not entirely...

379
00:41:32,329 --> 00:41:34,396
We can make it.

380
00:41:35,998 --> 00:41:40,066
Don't be a fool.
You'll never survive the jump.

381
00:41:40,067 --> 00:41:42,800
That's for the Maker to decide.

382
00:41:42,801 --> 00:41:44,676
Not a Templar!

383
00:41:49,070 --> 00:41:50,837
Get ready.

384
00:41:50,838 --> 00:41:53,839
Don't I get a say in this?

385
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:28,320
If I hadn't been here,
you would have been fish food.

386
00:42:52,228 --> 00:42:56,204
Preparations for the Ten Year Gathering
are proceeding without delay.

387
00:42:58,909 --> 00:43:02,316
You have done
a superb job, as always.

388
00:43:02,317 --> 00:43:07,323
I shudder to think what I would do
without your selfless service.

389
00:43:07,328 --> 00:43:09,567
You need never worry about that.

390
00:43:09,568 --> 00:43:11,906
Since the day I entered
the Chantry as a girl,

391
00:43:11,907 --> 00:43:15,084
I have wished only to be
the Right Hand of the Divine.

392
00:43:17,318 --> 00:43:22,325
And that you are.
More than I could ever ask.

393
00:43:22,664 --> 00:43:26,880
It will be a great day
for the Chantry, the Maker willing.

394
00:43:31,017 --> 00:43:36,023
No matter what happens,
we must continue with the ceremony.

395
00:43:36,997 --> 00:43:41,246
The Knight Commander has assured me
the Templars can handle Chantry security.

396
00:43:48,146 --> 00:43:50,881
Come on. Just a little farther.

397
00:43:50,882 --> 00:43:52,953
We can rest here for a while.

398
00:43:55,787 --> 00:44:00,457
Now then... Let there be light.

399
00:44:13,338 --> 00:44:17,308
Cassandra, please...
let me treat your wound.

400
00:44:23,681 --> 00:44:26,115
Ah, that is a nasty scrape.

401
00:44:26,116 --> 00:44:27,618
Fortunately...

402
00:44:29,586 --> 00:44:31,964
I happen to have just the thing for it.

403
00:44:32,957 --> 00:44:34,994
Now this will hurt a bit.

404
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:38,203
Sorry.

405
00:44:41,965 --> 00:44:46,710
My battle magic is mediocre,
but I am excellent at healing spells.

406
00:45:04,122 --> 00:45:07,035
You should be able to
move it normally in a day or so.

407
00:45:09,627 --> 00:45:12,896
My elder brother knew all
about healing herbs.

408
00:45:12,897 --> 00:45:15,631
Ah. Was he a Mage?

409
00:45:17,701 --> 00:45:20,409
It's merely a jest.

410
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:26,218
He was murdered by Mages.

411
00:45:27,844 --> 00:45:32,844
Blood Mages... When I was a child,

412
00:45:33,216 --> 00:45:36,552
my brother was cut down
right in front of me...

413
00:45:36,553 --> 00:45:41,023
They needed fresh dragon
blood for their rituals...

414
00:45:41,024 --> 00:45:46,024
So they came looking for the legendary
dragon-hunting families of Nevarra,

415
00:45:46,163 --> 00:45:49,167
to capture a dragon for them.

416
00:45:54,503 --> 00:45:57,273
My brother was the best in our family.

417
00:45:57,274 --> 00:46:00,242
His skills and honor were unmatched.

418
00:46:00,243 --> 00:46:04,680
He wouldn't sacrifice a
dragon for their corrupted magic.

419
00:46:04,681 --> 00:46:08,751
The Blood Mages killed
all those who refused them.

420
00:46:15,792 --> 00:46:17,738
Uncle!!

421
00:46:29,773 --> 00:46:32,073
Anthony...!

422
00:46:50,426 --> 00:46:55,426
My brother was strong... kind...
and I loved him dearly...

423
00:46:56,466 --> 00:46:59,334
I've hated Mages ever since...

424
00:46:59,335 --> 00:47:03,338
Blood or Circle Mages...
They all seemed the same to me.

425
00:47:03,339 --> 00:47:07,345
No different from the Mage
who murdered my brother...

426
00:47:10,413 --> 00:47:12,984
I'm so sorry, Cassandra.

427
00:47:17,287 --> 00:47:22,287
It is true that both Circle
and Blood Mages are Mages...

428
00:47:22,458 --> 00:47:24,025
Our methods may differ,

429
00:47:24,026 --> 00:47:27,030
but there is no denying
we practice a common art...

430
00:47:28,697 --> 00:47:32,467
And as a Mage, I would
like to express my sorrow.

431
00:47:32,468 --> 00:47:36,644
What happened to your brother
was truly something horrendous.

432
00:48:33,662 --> 00:48:35,164
Move in.

433
00:48:45,341 --> 00:48:46,241
They're gone!

434
00:48:46,242 --> 00:48:48,778
They couldn't have gotten far.

435
00:48:50,613 --> 00:48:51,880
Find them!

436
00:48:51,881 --> 00:48:53,622
Sir!

437
00:49:07,696 --> 00:49:10,197
Cassandra and the Mage
have disappeared, Frenic...

438
00:49:10,198 --> 00:49:14,044
They must be eliminated
before the Ten Year Gathering" Oh!

439
00:49:17,373 --> 00:49:19,648
You were saying, Commander?

440
00:49:29,050 --> 00:49:30,620
What have we here?

441
00:49:31,619 --> 00:49:35,328
This is an Elven Stone. He was
sending a message to someone.

442
00:49:36,558 --> 00:49:39,259
"Understood, Knight Commander.
I will commence the search

443
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:43,402
for Cassandra and Galyan's
whereabouts immediately. Frenic."

444
00:49:48,570 --> 00:49:53,273
So, then... you are in league with Frenic.

445
00:49:53,274 --> 00:49:56,109
That's how you
found us so quickly!

446
00:49:56,110 --> 00:49:59,580
You'll pay for your
betrayal of the Chantry!

447
00:50:09,691 --> 00:50:13,365
The wound still hurts,
doesn't it, Cassandra?

448
00:50:16,863 --> 00:50:20,434
You both know too much...

449
00:50:35,315 --> 00:50:38,051
Filthy traitor...

450
00:50:38,052 --> 00:50:41,721
Byron is dead because of you...

451
00:51:07,081 --> 00:51:09,048
No! This is not finished!

452
00:51:09,049 --> 00:51:12,818
Cassandra, protecting the Circle
and Chantry is more important than revenge.

453
00:51:12,819 --> 00:51:14,755
I owe it to Byron!

454
00:51:14,756 --> 00:51:17,759
We must show this
stone to the Chantry at once!

455
00:51:18,759 --> 00:51:20,761
Cassandra!

456
00:51:47,954 --> 00:51:50,628
The conversion is complete...

457
00:51:54,561 --> 00:51:59,561
Behold! The terror we
shall soon unleash upon the Chantry!

458
00:52:00,934 --> 00:52:04,136
Now Avexis... Make them fly!

459
00:52:15,749 --> 00:52:20,749
Let our cries for vengeance
be carried forth on wings of fire...

460
00:52:23,724 --> 00:52:25,491
Good...

461
00:52:29,730 --> 00:52:32,904
Good...

462
00:52:38,138 --> 00:52:43,138
[Iswishing, thwacking noises]

463
00:52:46,145 --> 00:52:49,648
Go now. Safe journey, my friend.

464
00:52:55,188 --> 00:52:56,791
This is it!

465
00:52:58,425 --> 00:53:02,627
[Icreaking, groaning noise]

466
00:53:02,628 --> 00:53:04,196
Give me a hand.

467
00:53:04,197 --> 00:53:05,664
[Icreaking, groaning noise]

468
00:53:08,869 --> 00:53:12,213
The High Seeker's Office is through here.

469
00:53:18,944 --> 00:53:22,447
And you're sure that the
front door is out of the question?

470
00:53:22,448 --> 00:53:24,325
Just come on.

471
00:53:32,825 --> 00:53:35,126
Suddenly I get the
sense that sneaking in like this

472
00:53:35,127 --> 00:53:37,369
isn't going to help our case...

473
00:53:56,148 --> 00:53:58,924
I rather liked that cabinet.

474
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:02,887
High Seeker?

475
00:54:02,888 --> 00:54:06,089
I've been waiting for
your report, Cassandra...

476
00:54:06,090 --> 00:54:08,893
I feared you were captured.

477
00:54:08,894 --> 00:54:12,096
Feared? lthought
you were hunting me.

478
00:54:12,097 --> 00:54:16,934
I assumed you had your reasons
and that you would report in eventually.

479
00:54:16,935 --> 00:54:18,236
So...?

480
00:54:18,237 --> 00:54:20,114
<i>Where do I start...?</i>

481
00:54:28,013 --> 00:54:29,924
Hm...

482
00:54:31,883 --> 00:54:35,352
While the Knight Commander
and I have had our differences,

483
00:54:35,353 --> 00:54:39,456
I can't believe that he would go
so far as to subvert the Chantry.

484
00:54:39,457 --> 00:54:42,026
Then perhaps you should look at this.

485
00:54:42,027 --> 00:54:44,405
It's evidence of our claims.

486
00:54:47,533 --> 00:54:49,634
Interesting...

487
00:54:49,635 --> 00:54:52,203
I must show this to the Divine at once.

488
00:54:52,204 --> 00:54:53,972
So you believe me?

489
00:54:53,973 --> 00:54:57,908
You've risked your life and
honor in pursuit of the truth.

490
00:54:57,909 --> 00:55:00,445
How could I doubt?

491
00:55:00,446 --> 00:55:05,292
You have the heart of a true Seeker,
Cassandra... As did Byron.

492
00:55:06,985 --> 00:55:08,659
Thank you, Sir...

493
00:55:10,155 --> 00:55:13,223
Wait here until my return.

494
00:55:13,224 --> 00:55:15,994
But there is still so much to be done...

495
00:55:15,995 --> 00:55:20,131
Leave this to me...
and get some rest, Cassandra.

496
00:55:20,132 --> 00:55:22,236
Yes, High Seeker.

497
00:55:49,460 --> 00:55:51,133
High Seeker!

498
00:55:52,697 --> 00:55:54,031
You...!

499
00:55:54,032 --> 00:55:57,868
Isn't this yours? You left it in the cave.

500
00:55:57,869 --> 00:56:00,145
Allow me to return it.

501
00:56:04,342 --> 00:56:06,009
Seekers!

502
00:56:08,513 --> 00:56:09,513
High Seeker...!

503
00:56:09,514 --> 00:56:11,050
My liege!

504
00:56:12,717 --> 00:56:16,153
The fugitives murdered
the High Seeker. Arrest them!

505
00:56:16,154 --> 00:56:17,487
No!
...Hold her!

506
00:56:17,488 --> 00:56:19,798
Silence, traitor!
...He's lying!

507
00:56:20,892 --> 00:56:22,626
It was him!

508
00:56:22,627 --> 00:56:24,971
He's the murderer!

509
00:56:25,964 --> 00:56:28,638
He's the murderer!

510
00:57:01,832 --> 00:57:06,703
Confess before the Maker
and be absolved of your sins.

511
00:57:06,704 --> 00:57:09,606
I just murdered the High Seeker

512
00:57:09,607 --> 00:57:13,209
and framed Cassandra
and the fugitive Mage.

513
00:57:13,210 --> 00:57:15,845
They have been branded as traitors.

514
00:57:15,846 --> 00:57:20,522
And soon, they will be
executed for their crimes.

515
00:57:52,315 --> 00:57:55,418
Frenic and the girl are ready.

516
00:57:55,419 --> 00:57:57,987
A new era is upon us.

517
00:57:57,988 --> 00:58:02,334
The day where you may be
called "Divine" is imminent.

518
00:58:06,296 --> 00:58:08,397
And once the plan comes to fruition,

519
00:58:08,398 --> 00:58:12,501
I will personally ensure
that Frenic's mouth is sealed.

520
00:58:12,502 --> 00:58:15,604
Pitiful Blood Mage...

521
00:58:15,605 --> 00:58:19,246
I am looking forward
to the Ten Year Gathering.

522
00:58:31,021 --> 00:58:35,958
I don't understand it.
He was such a great man.

523
00:58:35,959 --> 00:58:38,769
Why would Cassandra do this?

524
00:58:40,831 --> 00:58:43,998
One can never fathom the
purpose of evil, Your Grace...

525
00:58:43,999 --> 00:58:47,811
But rest assured, they will
get theirjust reward.

526
00:58:52,508 --> 00:58:55,511
All of Orlais shares your pain, Most Holy,

527
00:58:55,512 --> 00:58:59,550
but in your own words, we must
proceed with the Ten Year Gathering.

528
00:59:00,950 --> 00:59:02,885
The Grand Clerics have assembled,

529
00:59:02,886 --> 00:59:06,155
and the congregation has
gathered in the courtyard.

530
00:59:06,156 --> 00:59:08,693
They eagerly await your blessing.

531
00:59:12,796 --> 00:59:17,796
I fear that great evil has
gathered amongst the good today...

532
00:59:17,801 --> 00:59:21,044
Pray that the Maker can
bring us all together.

533
00:59:40,923 --> 00:59:45,923
Byron and the High Seeker believed
in me... and now they're dead.

534
00:59:46,729 --> 00:59:50,233
I should've let you finish the Knight
Commander when we had the chance.

535
00:59:59,175 --> 01:00:01,576
Well, well, well...

536
01:00:08,017 --> 01:00:13,523
After all your efforts,
in the end, it came to this...

537
01:00:16,959 --> 01:00:21,529
You've landed your heads on the
chopping block, and we still have Avexis.

538
01:00:21,530 --> 01:00:23,364
What are you doing with her?

539
01:00:24,533 --> 01:00:26,568
You mean you don't know?

540
01:00:26,569 --> 01:00:29,304
The whole point of Frenic's
blood ritual was to give him

541
01:00:29,305 --> 01:00:32,606
complete control of
the girl and her abilities.

542
01:00:32,608 --> 01:00:34,986
Control her for what purpose?

543
01:00:36,445 --> 01:00:40,381
Frenic will use her powers to
summon dragons to the Chantry...

544
01:00:40,382 --> 01:00:43,251
They should be en route any moment.

545
01:00:43,252 --> 01:00:46,053
Is that even possible...?

546
01:00:46,054 --> 01:00:48,489
You're going after the Divine?!

547
01:00:48,490 --> 01:00:53,490
Yes, then a new era will unfold!
A new era where we rule...

548
01:00:55,396 --> 01:00:57,999
Even if you succeed in
murdering the Divine,

549
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,741
the Seekers will never let you seize power!

550
01:01:02,304 --> 01:01:04,283
Oh, really?

551
01:01:06,408 --> 01:01:09,355
You're right, they wouldn't...
Not him, at least.

552
01:01:10,411 --> 01:01:11,912
But a Cleric...?

553
01:01:11,913 --> 01:01:16,259
There's a reason they've chosen dragons
to carry out their assassination plot.

554
01:01:18,853 --> 01:01:21,521
The Divine and all the candidates
next in line to succeed her

555
01:01:21,522 --> 01:01:25,629
are attending the Ten Year Gathering,
and they will all be wiped out.

556
01:01:29,031 --> 01:01:32,666
This will be done publicly as
if it were a natural disaster,

557
01:01:32,667 --> 01:01:36,604
and whoever is left standing
will be the next Divine.

558
01:01:36,605 --> 01:01:40,677
But who is it? Who's the
traitor amongst the clerics?!

559
01:01:42,543 --> 01:01:47,014
I have no time to participate in
wild speculations with the likes of you.

560
01:01:47,015 --> 01:01:49,894
Who is the traitor...?! Who?!

561
01:01:50,551 --> 01:01:54,222
My orders are to execute you
before the start of the Gathering.

562
01:01:54,223 --> 01:01:59,399
You'll have to continue this conversation
with Byron and the High Seeker.

563
01:02:02,497 --> 01:02:05,569
Who?! Who is the traitor?!

564
01:02:07,068 --> 01:02:09,903
Templars! Prepare for the execution!

565
01:02:09,904 --> 01:02:13,840
Tell me! Come back here!

566
01:02:28,856 --> 01:02:32,059
Yes, take it all in, Avexis...

567
01:02:32,060 --> 01:02:36,696
We are witness to the final
moments of a dying age...

568
01:02:36,697 --> 01:02:39,399
And you shall bring about its demise.

569
01:03:28,783 --> 01:03:30,149
Oh, Maker above!

570
01:03:30,150 --> 01:03:32,151
Shine down your light and save me!

571
01:03:32,152 --> 01:03:33,723
Silence, prisoner.

572
01:03:39,293 --> 01:03:40,795
Wait!

573
01:03:47,802 --> 01:03:52,079
I'll dispatch this fallen Seeker myself.

574
01:03:59,413 --> 01:04:02,690
Hmph. Your bravery is commendable...

575
01:04:09,423 --> 01:04:10,960
Ahhhh!

576
01:04:26,106 --> 01:04:27,606
Galyan!

577
01:04:27,607 --> 01:04:29,109
Are you all right?

578
01:04:30,377 --> 01:04:32,678
Galyan.. We got your message...

579
01:04:32,679 --> 01:04:34,680
Sorry we had to cut things so close!

580
01:04:36,817 --> 01:04:39,318
I sent a message with a
bird to the Circle of Magi...

581
01:04:39,319 --> 01:04:41,453
Thank the Maker it arrived...

582
01:04:54,568 --> 01:04:56,302
After you were captured, we trailed

583
01:04:56,303 --> 01:05:00,873
the Knight Commander and learned
some very interesting information...

584
01:05:00,874 --> 01:05:04,876
He has been conspiring
with the Grand Cleric of Orlais.

585
01:05:04,877 --> 01:05:06,745
The Grand Cleric?!

586
01:05:06,746 --> 01:05:10,922
Yes.They have been
meeting secretly for months.

587
01:05:37,710 --> 01:05:39,280
Hyaargh!

588
01:05:42,615 --> 01:05:44,390
Cassandra!

589
01:05:47,254 --> 01:05:49,454
I know about the Grand Cleric.

590
01:05:49,455 --> 01:05:52,390
You have both turned
your backs on the Chantry!

591
01:05:52,391 --> 01:05:57,229
Ha! On the contrary, we are
ushering in a new era for the Chantry...

592
01:05:57,230 --> 01:06:00,733
One where events like
Kirkwall will not be tolerated!

593
01:06:00,734 --> 01:06:03,969
We won't allow your plan to succeed!

594
01:06:40,105 --> 01:06:42,339
"Hate can only breed more hate."

595
01:06:42,340 --> 01:06:45,686
Those were Byron's last words to me.

596
01:06:46,812 --> 01:06:49,647
Cassandra...

597
01:06:49,648 --> 01:06:53,185
Tie him up. He will answer for his crimes.

598
01:06:54,986 --> 01:06:56,796
You heard her. Up!

599
01:07:16,442 --> 01:07:20,143
In the end, it came to this...

600
01:07:24,048 --> 01:07:25,892
It's the start of the Gathering.

601
01:07:34,126 --> 01:07:39,126
Citizens of Orlais,
honored faithful from lands beyond,

602
01:07:39,497 --> 01:07:44,497
today we gather to honor the
Maker and his greatest gift to us...

603
01:07:45,069 --> 01:07:50,069
his wife of the spirit,
Andraste, our beloved prophet

604
01:07:50,809 --> 01:07:54,811
<i>who gave her life so that
the Chantry might live...</i>

605
01:07:54,812 --> 01:07:59,812
This day, each decade,
marks the beginning of a new life.

606
01:08:01,252 --> 01:08:04,688
A day when the Maker's
benediction brings greatjoy and...

607
01:08:38,690 --> 01:08:43,366
Go on! Good! Crush them all!

608
01:08:53,905 --> 01:08:58,911
[Iscreaming, frantic cries of the clerics]

609
01:09:00,911 --> 01:09:05,418
Maker's wrath! He sends
dragons to punish our sins!

610
01:09:17,795 --> 01:09:19,730
Protect the Divine!

611
01:09:19,731 --> 01:09:21,301
Come on!

612
01:09:30,074 --> 01:09:31,073
Most Holy...

613
01:09:31,074 --> 01:09:33,076
<i>No... She's cut off...</i>

614
01:09:45,088 --> 01:09:47,156
<i>We're too late...</i>

615
01:09:47,157 --> 01:09:49,492
Frenic and Avexis should be close by!

616
01:09:49,493 --> 01:09:52,133
I'll find them!

617
01:10:36,706 --> 01:10:41,712
[Ipained, gradually weakening roars]

618
01:11:26,790 --> 01:11:29,794
Dragon Hunter...

619
01:11:33,296 --> 01:11:35,468
Call the High Dragon!

620
01:12:13,569 --> 01:12:18,273
Finish her! Yes! Yes!! Hahahaha!

621
01:12:18,274 --> 01:12:21,255
She's done enough of your bidding, Frenic.

622
01:12:22,278 --> 01:12:24,815
You'll never harm this girl again!

623
01:12:27,316 --> 01:12:30,126
It's over. All of it.

624
01:13:26,507 --> 01:13:28,647
<i>No... No!!</i>

625
01:13:43,825 --> 01:13:45,669
Are you all right, your grace?

626
01:13:50,999 --> 01:13:52,332
Your Holiness!

627
01:13:54,169 --> 01:13:55,402
Most Holy!

628
01:13:55,403 --> 01:13:56,837
Quickly. Help her down.

629
01:13:56,838 --> 01:13:59,206
Your Holiness!
...Right, we've got her.

630
01:13:59,207 --> 01:14:02,076
Thank you, Cassandra...
Come, Your Holiness.

631
01:14:02,077 --> 01:14:03,919
The Maker be with you!

632
01:14:05,547 --> 01:14:08,415
Heh, heh, heh...

633
01:14:08,416 --> 01:14:13,416
Fool... Do you really
think I will surrender so easily?

634
01:14:30,538 --> 01:14:31,642
Hyargh!

635
01:14:38,046 --> 01:14:39,581
Together, men!

636
01:14:46,954 --> 01:14:48,456
<i>Frenic...</i>

637
01:14:53,895 --> 01:14:55,728
There is no one coming to help you.

638
01:14:55,729 --> 01:14:57,903
The Knight Commander is dead.

639
01:15:05,573 --> 01:15:08,816
Do you hear? Your plan failed, Mage.

640
01:15:31,765 --> 01:15:36,303
You are no longer of any use to me!

641
01:15:36,304 --> 01:15:38,105
This was never about her.

642
01:15:38,106 --> 01:15:41,173
I merely exploited her ambition
as a means to free us

643
01:15:41,174 --> 01:15:48,320
from the oppressive binds of the Chantry,
and create a new world controlled by Mages!

644
01:15:50,618 --> 01:15:55,154
As a fellow Mage, you should understand.

645
01:15:55,155 --> 01:15:57,499
You and I are not the same.

646
01:15:58,492 --> 01:16:02,964
Then I will destroy you all,
along with the Chantry!

647
01:16:06,032 --> 01:16:07,705
Hwa!

648
01:16:17,577 --> 01:16:20,547
<i>Eh... heh heh heh...</i>

649
01:16:20,548 --> 01:16:23,048
Yaaa!

650
01:16:23,049 --> 01:16:27,419
[Iripping, crunching sounds]

651
01:16:48,875 --> 01:16:51,616
Now, men! Everything you've got!

652
01:17:21,741 --> 01:17:26,741
Avexis! Wake up! Avexis! Please!

653
01:17:26,779 --> 01:17:28,747
We need you, Avexis! Wake up!

654
01:17:40,961 --> 01:17:42,667
Aaaaaghg

655
01:18:04,184 --> 01:18:06,518
Thank you, Avexis...

656
01:18:30,142 --> 01:18:31,815
Come on!

657
01:19:23,228 --> 01:19:28,439
The righteous stand before the darkness
and the Maker shall guide their hands.

658
01:19:34,439 --> 01:19:36,248
Cassandra...!

659
01:20:16,948 --> 01:20:19,224
For the Chantry!

660
01:20:20,551 --> 01:20:22,387
For the Chantry!

661
01:20:22,388 --> 01:20:25,288
For the Chantry!

662
01:20:25,289 --> 01:20:27,557
Yeeeahyg

663
01:20:57,255 --> 01:21:01,625
What do you think...?
Not bad, huh?

664
01:21:05,762 --> 01:21:07,597
Cassandra...

665
01:21:07,598 --> 01:21:12,169
You are the bravest person I have
ever met, and the most beautiful...

666
01:21:12,170 --> 01:21:15,014
This isn't the time or the place!

667
01:21:17,442 --> 01:21:19,046
You fool.

668
01:21:28,051 --> 01:21:33,051
Galyan, you've helped me win
back more than just my honor.

669
01:21:33,858 --> 01:21:37,395
Suddenly, the world is
different for me now.

670
01:21:41,332 --> 01:21:44,336
Thank you, for everything.

671
01:22:18,035 --> 01:22:23,035
For risking her life to protect the
Chantry against the darkest of evil,

672
01:22:25,076 --> 01:22:30,075
I hereby proclaim Cassandra
Pentaghast the Hero of Orlais.

673
01:22:33,216 --> 01:22:37,387
And the Chantry also
wishes to express its appreciation...

674
01:22:37,388 --> 01:22:42,387
of the heroic Mage that fought
beside her, Regalyan d'Marcall.

675
01:22:57,807 --> 01:23:02,610
And for upholding the highest
standards of the Order of Seekers

676
01:23:02,612 --> 01:23:07,612
and demonstrating
unwavering faith to the Chantry,

677
01:23:07,751 --> 01:23:12,751
Cassandra Pentaghast shall from this day
forward be the Right Hand of the Divine.

678
01:23:30,073 --> 01:23:31,949
Come forth, child.

679
01:24:27,029 --> 01:24:28,804
Your Holiness...

680
01:24:30,367 --> 01:24:32,073
Cassandra...

681
01:24:33,903 --> 01:24:36,137
You seem troubled.

682
01:24:36,138 --> 01:24:40,208
This attack... It is only the beginning.

683
01:24:40,209 --> 01:24:45,522
There is a storm coming, child.
We must be prepared.

684
01:24:49,585 --> 01:24:51,690
How may I serve?
