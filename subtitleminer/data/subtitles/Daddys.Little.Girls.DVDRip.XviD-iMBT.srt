00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:40,664
- Morning, Ms. Rita.
- Morning, Monty.

2
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:43,270
- Hey, Maya.
- Hey, Monty.

3
00:02:43,372 --> 00:02:44,532
Hey, baby.

4
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,403
- What up, Willie?
- What's up, young blood?

5
00:02:46,508 --> 00:02:49,306
- How are you?
- Old and tired, man.

6
00:02:50,579 --> 00:02:54,845
- That woman say this engine won't start.
- Yeah. Well, it won't.

7
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:56,941
You know, Monty,
he was supposed to fix it.

8
00:02:57,052 --> 00:02:58,713
He never did.

9
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:01,050
He don't know what he doing.
That fool can't even see.

10
00:03:01,156 --> 00:03:03,249
I saw your mama the night you was made.

11
00:03:03,358 --> 00:03:06,521
What you say to me?
Don't make me put this baby down.

12
00:03:06,628 --> 00:03:07,993
And that ain't no way to talk to me.

13
00:03:08,096 --> 00:03:10,064
I gave this car service
one of its best clients.

14
00:03:10,165 --> 00:03:12,292
- Yeah. You never let me forget it, neither.
- That's right.

15
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:14,062
- Maya, I'll look at it for you, baby.
- Thank you.

16
00:03:14,169 --> 00:03:15,466
Take a seat.

17
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:16,594
You all right?

18
00:03:16,705 --> 00:03:18,764
And you better do something,
you know Chico quit.

19
00:03:18,874 --> 00:03:21,274
You're gonna lose my boss as a client.

20
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:25,243
- Here you go, boy.
- How much is here?

21
00:03:25,347 --> 00:03:28,544
Well, not enough, but I'll get it to you.
I promise, okay?

22
00:03:31,486 --> 00:03:35,013
Hey, man, look,
I just lost one of my drivers.

23
00:03:35,123 --> 00:03:38,456
He was the only one classy enough to drive
one of them corporate types, you know.

24
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,652
Now, listen to me.

25
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:42,389
No, no, no, Willie. You know
I can't stand them stuck-up types.

26
00:03:42,497 --> 00:03:43,930
Hear me out. It pays good.

27
00:03:44,032 --> 00:03:45,522
Oh, come on now.

28
00:03:45,634 --> 00:03:48,467
It will help you make more
of a down payment for this place.

29
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:50,470
Man, Willie, you know
I'm better under the hood

30
00:03:50,572 --> 00:03:51,903
than I am behind the wheel, man.

31
00:03:52,007 --> 00:03:55,067
Do you really wanna buy this place?
Now this is a start.

32
00:03:55,177 --> 00:03:57,304
Pay is good. Now she's a good client.

33
00:03:57,412 --> 00:03:59,073
And she pays well. I don't want to lose her.

34
00:03:59,181 --> 00:04:00,739
- I'll think about it.
- You'll think what?

35
00:04:00,849 --> 00:04:02,544
- I'll think about it.
- What?

36
00:04:02,651 --> 00:04:04,676
- Watch it, old man.
- You watch it.

37
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:06,515
Maya, turn the key.

38
00:04:12,594 --> 00:04:15,654
- Thank you, Monty.
- All right, baby.

39
00:04:16,531 --> 00:04:19,295
You know, this should really be your place.

40
00:04:19,401 --> 00:04:22,336
Oh, it will be soon, baby. All right.

41
00:05:03,578 --> 00:05:06,444
- Hey, boy. How you been?
- What up, Kevin?

42
00:05:06,547 --> 00:05:07,980
You all right?

43
00:05:08,082 --> 00:05:09,982
Amen, amen.

44
00:05:10,084 --> 00:05:13,520
Wilbert, get up.

45
00:05:13,621 --> 00:05:14,952
- Hey, Monty.
- Hey, Ms. Rochelle.

46
00:05:15,055 --> 00:05:16,420
You got people stepping all over you.

47
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:17,650
- Get up.
- He at it again?

48
00:05:17,758 --> 00:05:19,521
Always. Always.

49
00:05:19,627 --> 00:05:21,424
Hi, Monty.

50
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:24,293
Wilbert. Get up, boy.

51
00:05:24,398 --> 00:05:25,865
Anybody home?

52
00:05:25,966 --> 00:05:28,298
Sierra, get the door.

53
00:05:35,276 --> 00:05:38,302
- Who is it?
- Who is it? It's your daddy. Open up.

54
00:05:38,412 --> 00:05:40,607
- Hey, y'all. It's Daddy.
- Daddy.

55
00:05:40,748 --> 00:05:43,148
Come on, y'all. Hurry up.

56
00:05:44,418 --> 00:05:47,683
What up? Come here.
Come here. Come here.

57
00:05:47,788 --> 00:05:50,279
What's going on? Can I get in?

58
00:05:51,292 --> 00:05:52,953
Hey, Ms. Katheryn.

59
00:05:53,961 --> 00:05:56,987
- Hey, Daddy. What did you bring us?
- Now, is that all I'm good for?

60
00:05:57,097 --> 00:05:59,531
- No, Daddy.
- Can I get some love?

61
00:06:00,801 --> 00:06:03,326
Daddy, you know
I got a B on my class project?

62
00:06:03,437 --> 00:06:05,632
- Thanks for helping me.
- What did I tell you?

63
00:06:05,739 --> 00:06:08,264
That I was gonna get a good grade
and I did.

64
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:10,741
Hey, Daddy, will you take us
to the movies this weekend?

65
00:06:10,845 --> 00:06:11,869
No.

66
00:06:13,147 --> 00:06:14,478
Okay.

67
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:16,243
I'll take you out to the movies.

68
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:19,046
You know Saturday
is Daddy-daughter day, so...

69
00:06:19,153 --> 00:06:22,452
- Okay. So, Daddy, what did you bring us?
- Just some food, baby.

70
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:26,392
That always comes in handy.

71
00:06:27,294 --> 00:06:29,455
You girls go in the room.
Let me to talk to your daddy.

72
00:06:29,563 --> 00:06:31,394
Yeah, get in there.
Don't let me come in there.

73
00:06:31,499 --> 00:06:33,763
What y'all doing? Playing checkers, huh?

74
00:06:33,868 --> 00:06:35,859
Y'all been playing something.

75
00:06:37,471 --> 00:06:39,063
Thanks, Katheryn.

76
00:06:39,173 --> 00:06:41,801
$200, this week.

77
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:44,741
I'll bring the rest to you.

78
00:06:46,614 --> 00:06:49,105
You know, Ms. Kat, you know
you got to take care of that cough.

79
00:06:49,216 --> 00:06:53,380
I mean, it sounds like it's getting worse
every time I come up in here.

80
00:06:53,487 --> 00:06:54,545
Yeah.

81
00:06:55,723 --> 00:06:58,851
- Jenny been by?
- That daughter of mine?

82
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:02,623
No, only time I see her
is when she's driving by.

83
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:06,029
She ain't been here
to see these girls in months.

84
00:07:06,133 --> 00:07:10,160
So happy you're here, or they wouldn't
know they had a daddy or a mama.

85
00:07:12,506 --> 00:07:14,997
Monty, listen.

86
00:07:15,409 --> 00:07:16,706
Sit down.

87
00:07:17,111 --> 00:07:18,476
What's wrong?

88
00:07:23,117 --> 00:07:26,917
I need you to go down
to family court with me right away

89
00:07:27,021 --> 00:07:29,751
so you can tell them
that you're taking the girls.

90
00:07:29,857 --> 00:07:31,688
I need you to raise them.

91
00:07:31,792 --> 00:07:34,386
Ms. Kat, you know I love my kids,
but I can't take them full time.

92
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:36,520
Well, then they're gonna have to stay
with their mama.

93
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:39,064
- Now, you know I don't want that.
- Neither do I.

94
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:43,125
Especially since she living with that Joe,
the biggest drug dealer in the area.

95
00:07:43,237 --> 00:07:47,071
Sitting up there in that window
staring down at all of us like he's God.

96
00:07:48,108 --> 00:07:50,269
And she's right there with him.

97
00:07:50,878 --> 00:07:53,506
She don't care about nobody but herself.

98
00:07:53,614 --> 00:07:57,573
Do you know what'll happen to them girls
if they have to live with their mama, huh?

99
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:00,186
God forbid.

100
00:08:01,322 --> 00:08:04,291
- Monty, please.
- Ms. Kat, I...

101
00:08:04,391 --> 00:08:06,325
I have lung cancer.

102
00:08:08,729 --> 00:08:11,163
I am dying, Monty.

103
00:08:11,265 --> 00:08:15,634
I've been hanging in there for them girls
as long as I can, but I'm tired.

104
00:08:17,004 --> 00:08:18,335
I'm tired.

105
00:08:23,277 --> 00:08:26,371
Why didn't you say something?
Why didn't you tell me this?

106
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:38,590
Ms. Kat, it's gonna be all right.

107
00:08:38,692 --> 00:08:41,058
It is not gonna be all right.

108
00:09:16,163 --> 00:09:17,994
Why didn't y'all call me?

109
00:09:18,098 --> 00:09:19,656
- Mommy!
- Don't look at her.

110
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:21,291
No, wait.
Wait, where do you think you're going?

111
00:09:21,402 --> 00:09:24,633
These are my kids.
Stop. Stop. Get into the car, baby.

112
00:09:24,738 --> 00:09:27,002
- Stop. Quit it.
- No, you get off of me.

113
00:09:27,107 --> 00:09:29,473
Stop it, Jenny. Stop it.

114
00:09:29,576 --> 00:09:32,443
- Everything all right, baby?
- No, you get my kids out of this car.

115
00:09:32,546 --> 00:09:34,980
Jenny, stop it now. Jenny, stop. Stop.

116
00:09:35,082 --> 00:09:37,175
You have not been
to see these kids in months.

117
00:09:37,284 --> 00:09:39,479
- You want to come take them now?
- Get your hands off of me.

118
00:09:39,586 --> 00:09:40,951
You got to be crazy. Get out of here.

119
00:09:41,055 --> 00:09:44,081
- Now, you need back up, son.
- Yo, do me a favor, shut up.

120
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:47,319
- Do me a favor, dawg, just hold it.
- Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

121
00:09:47,428 --> 00:09:49,521
Go ahead, baby. Go ahead.
Put your seatbelt on. It's okay.

122
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:51,154
This is your mother's funeral.

123
00:09:51,265 --> 00:09:54,234
And you know
she wanted these girls to go with him.

124
00:09:54,334 --> 00:09:56,198
Jennifer, you know it.

125
00:09:56,302 --> 00:09:58,293
You out whoring around with these thugs.

126
00:09:58,404 --> 00:10:00,895
She didn't want these girls
around all of this foolishness.

127
00:10:01,007 --> 00:10:02,668
Let me tell you something, Aunt Rita.

128
00:10:02,775 --> 00:10:05,938
All right, these are my kids.
Do you hear me?

129
00:10:06,045 --> 00:10:08,445
You ain't just gonna take them from me.

130
00:10:08,548 --> 00:10:11,176
And let me tell you,
you go make your mechanic money,

131
00:10:11,284 --> 00:10:14,310
you save it 'cause we going to court.
You hear me?

132
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:17,548
Give me my kids back.
You're gonna give them back to me.

133
00:10:20,326 --> 00:10:22,055
You stay out of my way.

134
00:10:22,161 --> 00:10:24,493
- What are you doing?
- Think you gonna let my mama die?

135
00:10:24,597 --> 00:10:25,928
Calm down. Come on, calm down.

136
00:10:26,032 --> 00:10:29,263
You gonna let them bury my mama
and you don't tell me, Wilbert?

137
00:10:29,368 --> 00:10:31,097
- You should've been there for your mama.
- That's right.

138
00:10:31,204 --> 00:10:33,172
- You know it ain't right.
- It's too late now.

139
00:10:35,374 --> 00:10:37,569
Daddy, you know this place
is too small for all of us.

140
00:10:37,677 --> 00:10:40,043
- We don't have anywhere else to go.
- We can go live with Mama.

141
00:10:40,146 --> 00:10:42,637
China, Mama don't want us. She never did.

142
00:10:42,749 --> 00:10:45,650
- That is not true.
- It is true.

143
00:10:45,752 --> 00:10:48,482
- Is that true, Daddy?
- I'll tell you what is true.

144
00:10:48,588 --> 00:10:50,886
I want you all to come stay with me.

145
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:52,548
Where are we gonna sleep?

146
00:10:52,658 --> 00:10:55,855
Well, I'm gonna sleep on the couch
and you guys,

147
00:10:55,962 --> 00:10:58,487
I mean girls,
are gonna sleep in the bedroom.

148
00:11:00,466 --> 00:11:02,195
I fixed it up.

149
00:11:02,301 --> 00:11:04,166
How bad was it before?

150
00:11:06,005 --> 00:11:08,166
Daddy, China pees in the bed.

151
00:11:08,274 --> 00:11:09,901
And I ain't sleeping with her.

152
00:11:10,009 --> 00:11:11,101
I do not.

153
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:13,405
Why I got to put up
with being insulted like that?

154
00:11:13,513 --> 00:11:15,037
- What's wrong with you?
- Whatever.

155
00:11:15,148 --> 00:11:17,844
We need some separate beds
or some bunk beds or something

156
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:20,248
- 'cause this ain't gonna work.
- Well, I'll work on it, okay?

157
00:11:20,353 --> 00:11:23,151
Well, while you work on it,
how about feeding us?

158
00:11:23,256 --> 00:11:25,884
And getting all three of us some food?
'Cause all three of us are hungry.

159
00:11:25,992 --> 00:11:27,892
You know what?
You got a mouth like your mama.

160
00:11:27,994 --> 00:11:31,725
You need to put your clothes
in them drawers right here. Thank you.

161
00:11:31,831 --> 00:11:33,594
I like this bedroom.

162
00:11:48,681 --> 00:11:50,410
Lord, how am I gonna do this?

163
00:12:02,829 --> 00:12:05,491
Man, I can't believe I'm doing this.

164
00:12:05,598 --> 00:12:07,759
You waiting for Ms. Rossmore?

165
00:12:10,503 --> 00:12:13,233
Yeah. Rossmore. Julia Rossmore.

166
00:12:15,174 --> 00:12:16,471
Good luck.

167
00:12:17,143 --> 00:12:19,270
What do you mean, "Good luck"?

168
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:24,005
- Good day, Ms. Rossmore.
- Good morning.

169
00:12:31,157 --> 00:12:34,923
- You gonna open the door?
- Yeah. Yeah.

170
00:12:40,867 --> 00:12:43,131
- Can you close the door?
- Yeah.

171
00:12:47,206 --> 00:12:48,969
What you laughing at?

172
00:12:56,249 --> 00:12:59,309
Tell him to meet me there.
Tell him to wait then.

173
00:13:00,519 --> 00:13:03,750
I'm surprised
the jury has returned so soon, myself.

174
00:13:03,856 --> 00:13:07,883
No, it's a great thing. Yeah, definitely.
All right, see you in a second.

175
00:13:09,128 --> 00:13:11,494
Did they tell you I need you to be on call?

176
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:17,102
- Oh, you talking to me?
- You're the only other person in the car.

177
00:13:17,203 --> 00:13:20,263
Oh, no. You know what? I thought
you were still on the phone, you know.

178
00:13:20,373 --> 00:13:25,242
Well, basically, all I need you to do
is get me to the office and get me to court.

179
00:13:25,344 --> 00:13:26,538
Sometimes I work late.

180
00:13:26,646 --> 00:13:29,080
And sometimes I entertain clients
after work, that sort of thing.

181
00:13:29,181 --> 00:13:32,378
You know what, Ms. Rossmore? Right now
I need all the overtime I can get so...

182
00:13:32,485 --> 00:13:34,385
- I'm sorry. What's your name?
- Monty.

183
00:13:34,487 --> 00:13:38,184
Monty. Look, I don't like to fraternize so
let's keep this strictly professional. Okay?

184
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:39,952
- Yes, ma'am.
- Fabulous.

185
00:13:50,002 --> 00:13:51,299
Excuse me.

186
00:13:52,171 --> 00:13:53,934
I'm sorry about that.

187
00:14:05,451 --> 00:14:07,783
Are you... Am I getting punked?

188
00:14:08,721 --> 00:14:11,212
No, you're not getting punked, ma'am.

189
00:14:11,324 --> 00:14:13,519
I just, you know,
thought you might want the radio on.

190
00:14:13,626 --> 00:14:15,560
- No, I like silence.
- Yes, ma'am.

191
00:14:15,661 --> 00:14:16,821
Silence.

192
00:14:16,929 --> 00:14:19,295
You've missed your turn.
I asked you to take the freeway.

193
00:14:19,398 --> 00:14:20,831
Well, you know what?
This way is much faster.

194
00:14:20,933 --> 00:14:21,991
Excuse me?

195
00:14:22,101 --> 00:14:24,365
Yeah. You seem like you're in a rush
and this way is faster, so...

196
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:26,495
Yeah, I am in a rush and I know this city!

197
00:14:26,605 --> 00:14:29,369
The freeway would have bypassed
all of this lunchtime traffic.

198
00:14:29,475 --> 00:14:30,874
I cannot believe this.

199
00:14:30,977 --> 00:14:34,504
- Why are you stopping?
- Because we're here now.

200
00:14:40,987 --> 00:14:43,751
- Next time follow my instructions, okay?
- Yes, ma'am.

201
00:14:50,028 --> 00:14:51,188
Ms. Rossmore.

202
00:14:51,296 --> 00:14:54,060
The jury has a question
that they need answered.

203
00:14:54,165 --> 00:14:56,827
They want to know if
the damage award can be higher

204
00:14:56,935 --> 00:14:59,597
- than what was previously requested.
- Well, Your Honor...

205
00:14:59,704 --> 00:15:01,535
How's the driving going?

206
00:15:01,639 --> 00:15:04,130
Oh, look, she is something else.

207
00:15:04,242 --> 00:15:06,767
I know. I've worked for her four years.

208
00:15:06,878 --> 00:15:10,871
She's good though. She wins every case.
And this is a big one.

209
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:13,283
Settlement.

210
00:15:14,219 --> 00:15:16,619
That means she just won a grip of money.

211
00:15:16,721 --> 00:15:18,382
She's that good?

212
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:20,287
My client's willing to talk.

213
00:15:20,392 --> 00:15:23,793
Oh, and she's also impatient.
So you might want to get out to the car.

214
00:15:37,642 --> 00:15:39,473
Sorry about that.

215
00:15:43,114 --> 00:15:45,344
Your Honor, the people have no evidence.

216
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:47,418
- We have evidence.
- That is not admissible.

217
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:50,750
The search warrant gave them the right
to search the house not the car.

218
00:15:50,855 --> 00:15:52,186
- He's right.
- Your Honor...

219
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:54,815
The evidence of the drugs is inadmissible.

220
00:15:54,926 --> 00:15:57,986
In that case, Your Honor, we immediately
ask that all the charges be dropped

221
00:15:58,096 --> 00:15:59,723
and that the case be dismissed
with prejudice.

222
00:15:59,831 --> 00:16:02,561
Your Honor, we need to get him
out of the neighborhood.

223
00:16:02,667 --> 00:16:04,760
Then your officers
should have been more careful.

224
00:16:04,869 --> 00:16:08,430
- Where is your eyewitness?
- He has intimidated the entire community.

225
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:10,872
Then your office
has its work cut out for them.

226
00:16:10,975 --> 00:16:13,273
I'm dismissing all the charges.

227
00:16:13,378 --> 00:16:14,777
Adjourned.

228
00:16:19,084 --> 00:16:20,984
They can't hold me, baby.

229
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:23,853
- You're the man.
- Thank you.

230
00:16:23,955 --> 00:16:27,118
You want some pizza?
All right, I'm gonna bring some for you.

231
00:16:27,225 --> 00:16:29,090
All right, I'll there soon.

232
00:16:29,194 --> 00:16:30,718
I love you.

233
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:37,898
- Well, do you see this?
- Yeah, I see it.

234
00:16:39,204 --> 00:16:40,501
I see it.

235
00:16:40,605 --> 00:16:42,539
You looking like a little massa boy.

236
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:45,131
Wow. So, you had to get yourself
another job, huh?

237
00:16:45,243 --> 00:16:47,803
Yeah, I know feeding them girls
ain't easy, huh?

238
00:16:47,912 --> 00:16:50,847
Here. Let me help you out.
Let me see what I got in here.

239
00:16:50,949 --> 00:16:53,349
Oh, look at that. Here. Take it.

240
00:16:53,451 --> 00:16:54,941
- Stop it.
- Take it.

241
00:16:55,053 --> 00:16:57,317
Oh, so, what, you Mr. Do the Right Thing?

242
00:16:57,422 --> 00:17:00,482
Oh, so, you don't want this money.
It's okay. I'll take it back.

243
00:17:00,592 --> 00:17:03,527
- You gonna leave me alone?
- What you gonna do, baby?

244
00:17:05,163 --> 00:17:07,791
You see that brother right there?

245
00:17:07,899 --> 00:17:12,029
If I even break a nail,
he will shut you down.

246
00:17:12,137 --> 00:17:14,435
And I'm coming for my daughters.

247
00:17:15,173 --> 00:17:19,200
You don't even want your kids. Huh?
Now, why would you do all this?

248
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:23,110
You tried to turn my mama against me,
huh?

249
00:17:23,214 --> 00:17:27,344
You tried to turn my kids against me?
It ain't gonna happen, baby.

250
00:17:27,452 --> 00:17:31,183
Yeah, I'm gonna make your life hell,
little punk.

251
00:17:31,289 --> 00:17:34,816
Look at him, Joe. I think he getting mad.

252
00:17:34,926 --> 00:17:38,157
He ain't gonna do nothing.
He's so scared to go back to jail.

253
00:17:38,263 --> 00:17:41,198
Yeah. Go on, looking like a slave.

254
00:17:41,299 --> 00:17:44,132
Go on, son. Mosey on down.

255
00:17:44,235 --> 00:17:46,260
- Go on and drive the car.
- Come on, now, baby.

256
00:17:46,371 --> 00:17:48,601
Let Stepin Fetchit get back to work now.

257
00:17:48,706 --> 00:17:51,072
- Hey, man. Nice suit.
- Stepin Fetchit!

258
00:17:51,176 --> 00:17:54,475
Look at you.
Looking just like a broke-down slave.

259
00:17:54,579 --> 00:17:57,980
I must've been a fool
having three babies by you.

260
00:17:58,116 --> 00:18:01,779
Oh, please. Yuck.
I'm just disgusted with myself.

261
00:18:04,789 --> 00:18:07,417
- Do you think that's him?
- I think that's him.

262
00:18:08,259 --> 00:18:09,920
- Hi.
- Excuse me.

263
00:18:10,028 --> 00:18:11,723
Is this Ms. Rossmore's car?

264
00:18:11,829 --> 00:18:14,059
- Who's asking?
- Yeah, this is it.

265
00:18:14,165 --> 00:18:15,393
- Excuse us. It's okay.
- Excuse us.

266
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,933
- No, we got it.
- We know her.

267
00:18:17,035 --> 00:18:18,127
- Thank you.
- Okay.

268
00:18:18,236 --> 00:18:19,931
- Thank you.
- Okay.

269
00:18:20,038 --> 00:18:21,471
Oh, goodness.

270
00:18:30,048 --> 00:18:32,915
- Ms. Rossmore, you got somebody...
- You gonna open my door?

271
00:18:33,017 --> 00:18:35,713
- You got...
- Are you going to open my door?

272
00:18:38,389 --> 00:18:40,550
What are you doing in my car?

273
00:18:44,629 --> 00:18:45,994
It's that time.

274
00:18:46,097 --> 00:18:47,223
- No, no.
- Yes.

275
00:18:47,332 --> 00:18:49,630
I just want to celebrate
winning this case, okay?

276
00:18:49,734 --> 00:18:53,170
- 3rd and Peachtree, please.
- I'm gonna have to pass on the blind date.

277
00:18:53,271 --> 00:18:55,000
I knew she was gonna say that.
Didn't I tell you that?

278
00:18:55,106 --> 00:18:56,937
- You're going out.
- I can't.

279
00:18:57,041 --> 00:18:59,669
Do you know what your associates
are saying about you at the office?

280
00:18:59,777 --> 00:19:00,801
I don't care.

281
00:19:00,912 --> 00:19:02,709
They're saying that you need a man, okay?

282
00:19:02,814 --> 00:19:05,374
And that you're taking it out
on everyone at the office.

283
00:19:05,483 --> 00:19:08,384
And they also say that you would be
a nicer person if you just got laid.

284
00:19:08,486 --> 00:19:09,578
I agree.

285
00:19:09,687 --> 00:19:13,817
I don't need to get laid,
as you so eloquently put it.

286
00:19:13,925 --> 00:19:14,914
Yes, you do.

287
00:19:15,026 --> 00:19:17,358
Look, we have been your friends
since college. We know what you need.

288
00:19:17,462 --> 00:19:20,226
Well, if you know me so well,
you'd know that I don't like blind dates.

289
00:19:20,331 --> 00:19:22,765
- They all end in disaster.
- Julia!

290
00:19:22,867 --> 00:19:26,667
First of all, I have a very, very good feeling
about this one. I do.

291
00:19:32,377 --> 00:19:36,108
Hey, so, Julia, I heard
you was like a lawyer and stuff.

292
00:19:36,214 --> 00:19:38,978
- I am.
- Yeah, so you got this then?

293
00:19:41,518 --> 00:19:43,452
- The bill?
- Yes.

294
00:19:46,023 --> 00:19:48,423
No, I'm serious, though.
This is a nice place.

295
00:19:48,525 --> 00:19:52,256
I like this environment.
You know, it's gangster.

296
00:19:52,362 --> 00:19:55,490
I feel like, you know,
you could do some things in here.

297
00:19:58,035 --> 00:20:00,094
You know what else is nice?

298
00:20:02,172 --> 00:20:04,504
You got some sexy-ass lips.

299
00:20:05,876 --> 00:20:07,741
I just wanna bite them.

300
00:20:09,646 --> 00:20:13,707
Suck on them. Suck your lips off your face.

301
00:20:16,386 --> 00:20:17,683
Yeah.

302
00:20:17,788 --> 00:20:20,348
I'm gonna kill Cynthia.

303
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:23,255
You don't wanna mess
with your boy right here.

304
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,123
I mean, if you like pleasure.

305
00:20:25,228 --> 00:20:26,752
Hey! Hey!

306
00:20:26,863 --> 00:20:27,921
Hey!

307
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,858
Hey! Hey, come here, player.

308
00:20:30,967 --> 00:20:32,229
Yes, sir.

309
00:20:32,336 --> 00:20:35,931
What kind of fish is this filet mignon?

310
00:20:38,942 --> 00:20:41,706
- I'm sorry.
- Y'all got Chinese food?

311
00:20:41,812 --> 00:20:44,303
I'm sorry. We don't, sir,
but how can I help you?

312
00:20:44,414 --> 00:20:46,405
You know what,
just give me some scrimps, man,

313
00:20:46,516 --> 00:20:50,213
and some hot sauce and some fries with it.

314
00:20:51,088 --> 00:20:52,612
- And for the lady?
- Yeah. You know what?

315
00:20:52,723 --> 00:20:54,987
This water is gonna be just fine.

316
00:20:55,092 --> 00:20:57,617
So we can just speed it along?

317
00:20:57,728 --> 00:20:59,252
- I understand.
- I bet you do.

318
00:20:59,363 --> 00:21:00,955
And your scrimps will come out
right away, sir.

319
00:21:01,064 --> 00:21:02,292
Thank you.

320
00:21:03,133 --> 00:21:05,499
Can we get some bread, man?
We're the only table without bread.

321
00:21:05,602 --> 00:21:07,297
- All the white people got bread.
- I apologize, sir.

322
00:21:07,404 --> 00:21:08,803
- I'll get that to you right away.
- Thank you.

323
00:21:11,508 --> 00:21:13,408
That's a lot of hot sauce.

324
00:21:16,446 --> 00:21:19,813
Well, what do you do for a living?

325
00:21:19,916 --> 00:21:23,750
Well, right now, I'm between jobs.
So I decided I'm gonna be a rapper.

326
00:21:27,124 --> 00:21:29,456
- A rapper?
- Yeah.

327
00:21:29,559 --> 00:21:32,187
- That's something.
- Straight up. Check it out. Look.

328
00:21:50,313 --> 00:21:51,837
You feel me?

329
00:21:55,952 --> 00:21:57,817
Man, I be feeling that 'cause like I just...

330
00:21:57,921 --> 00:22:00,446
- I'm sorry. How old are you?
- Forty, shorty.

331
00:22:00,557 --> 00:22:01,751
- Forty?
- Yeah.

332
00:22:01,858 --> 00:22:05,021
You don't think that's too old
to start a rap career?

333
00:22:05,695 --> 00:22:07,424
Why everybody keep saying that?

334
00:22:07,531 --> 00:22:11,558
I mean, yeah. But, you know, I'm good.
And I got a gimmick.

335
00:22:11,668 --> 00:22:13,602
You got to have a gimmick in this game.

336
00:22:13,703 --> 00:22:15,364
- You heard of 50 Cent?
- Yes.

337
00:22:15,472 --> 00:22:17,406
They call me 40 Percent.

338
00:22:17,507 --> 00:22:19,566
- Check, please. Check.
- They call me 40 P.

339
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:23,946
No, it's official.
No, this is my proclamation, Cynthia.

340
00:22:24,047 --> 00:22:25,605
<i>- I'm giving up on men.
- Why?</i>

341
00:22:25,715 --> 00:22:28,513
<i>'Cause I'm 31. I've never been married.
I don't have any kids.</i>

342
00:22:28,618 --> 00:22:30,518
I don't even have a cat to curl up with.

343
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:34,818
And because I make six figures,
I can't find a decent man to save my life.

344
00:22:34,925 --> 00:22:36,859
<i>- What was wrong with this guy?
- Are you kidding me?</i>

345
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,724
That man had no class, Cyn.
No, he had no class.

346
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:42,924
He was screaming across the restaurant
for some scrimps.

347
00:22:43,033 --> 00:22:46,127
Yeah, scrimps.
I don't even know how to spell "scrimps."

348
00:22:46,236 --> 00:22:48,670
Am I being unreasonable?

349
00:22:48,772 --> 00:22:51,332
All I want is a man
who knows when to hold me,

350
00:22:51,441 --> 00:22:54,239
and rub my feet, and make me feel safe.

351
00:22:54,344 --> 00:22:56,073
Is that too much to ask?

352
00:22:56,179 --> 00:22:59,307
No, sweetie, it's all possible if you
just relax your standards a little bit.

353
00:22:59,416 --> 00:23:00,508
<i>Girl, whatever.</i>

354
00:23:00,617 --> 00:23:03,142
And what's up with the black men
all trying to be down?

355
00:23:03,253 --> 00:23:06,222
All of a sudden,
everybody's got to be down.

356
00:23:06,323 --> 00:23:08,985
<i>Like speaking correct English
is somehow uncool.</i>

357
00:23:09,092 --> 00:23:13,028
Like verb-noun agreement is just too much.

358
00:23:13,129 --> 00:23:16,257
And if I see another black man over 30
in a throwback jersey,

359
00:23:16,366 --> 00:23:18,197
girl, I'm gonna scream.

360
00:23:24,541 --> 00:23:27,271
- What was that?
- I just saw one.

361
00:23:27,377 --> 00:23:31,404
Julia, I just think you're too hard
on some of these guys, okay?

362
00:23:31,515 --> 00:23:34,040
<i>- You just need to relax a little bit.
- Excuse me.</i>

363
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:35,378
I have standards.

364
00:23:35,485 --> 00:23:38,454
Yeah. Well, the Pope
can't meet your standards, okay?

365
00:23:38,555 --> 00:23:43,322
And I don't mean to be rude, sweetie,
but I got a man waiting for me.

366
00:23:43,426 --> 00:23:45,519
I gots to go.

367
00:23:45,629 --> 00:23:48,564
No, go. No, go. It's cool.

368
00:23:48,665 --> 00:23:51,657
- Don't hate.
- I'm not hating, Cyn.

369
00:23:51,768 --> 00:23:54,669
<i>- All right. I'm just saying.
- No, my battery is dying anyway.</i>

370
00:23:54,771 --> 00:23:57,672
<i>- Wait, I can't... I can't hear you.
- Hello?</i>

371
00:24:00,377 --> 00:24:02,504
- You got to be kidding me.
- I am so sorry.

372
00:24:02,612 --> 00:24:05,172
- You got to be kidding me.
- I'm sorry.

373
00:24:06,449 --> 00:24:09,213
- You're gonna answer it?
- You know what? I got to get this one.

374
00:24:09,319 --> 00:24:12,220
It's my neighbor and she got my kids.
Excuse me.

375
00:24:12,322 --> 00:24:14,449
- Unbelievable.
- Hold on.

376
00:24:16,259 --> 00:24:17,658
You're on company time.

377
00:24:17,761 --> 00:24:19,752
You're not supposed
to be taking personal calls.

378
00:24:19,863 --> 00:24:22,161
What happened? Yeah, I know where it is.
I'm on my way.

379
00:24:22,265 --> 00:24:24,756
Whoa. Whoa. Where are you taking me?

380
00:24:24,868 --> 00:24:25,960
- Lady.
- I'm being kidnapped.

381
00:24:26,069 --> 00:24:28,560
- I'm being kidnapped! Somebody help!
- Lady, stop. Stop.

382
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:31,698
- You stop 'cause you're in big trouble, pal.
- Look, lady. Look, I'm sorry.

383
00:24:31,808 --> 00:24:33,240
No, no, no. You're gonna be sorry.

384
00:24:33,342 --> 00:24:36,334
You have a big problem
because you're fired. Fired.

385
00:24:36,445 --> 00:24:37,776
I have a problem right now

386
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:41,748
and I am so tired of your stuck-up ass
giving me a hard time.

387
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:45,616
Now, do me a favor.
Sit back, shut up and ride, okay?

388
00:24:45,721 --> 00:24:47,052
Thank you.

389
00:25:15,384 --> 00:25:18,410
I do not believe this.

390
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:22,183
No way. No way. No. No, he didn't do this.

391
00:25:22,291 --> 00:25:25,488
Excuse me. I'm Monty James.
You have my kids here?

392
00:25:25,594 --> 00:25:28,222
Have a seat.
Someone will be with you in a minute.

393
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:29,729
- Yeah, I'm still here.
- Are they here?

394
00:25:29,832 --> 00:25:31,766
Excuse me. Are they all right?

395
00:25:31,867 --> 00:25:34,563
- Have a seat, sir.
- Where are they?

396
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:37,468
Excuse me. Excuse me. Where are they?

397
00:25:37,573 --> 00:25:39,200
Have a seat, sir.

398
00:25:45,547 --> 00:25:48,675
Did he take the keys?
He took the keys. He took the keys.

399
00:25:48,817 --> 00:25:51,081
Fabulous. Fabulous.

400
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:56,220
I'm just gonna call... Who can I call?
My battery's dead. Great.

401
00:25:58,027 --> 00:26:02,191
No, no. Julia, no. You're in control here.

402
00:26:02,297 --> 00:26:06,461
And you're just gonna walk in there
and demand he take you home.

403
00:26:06,568 --> 00:26:09,867
"Take me home, wodey."
No, do they say that?

404
00:26:09,972 --> 00:26:12,736
No. "Take me home, brother."

405
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:15,534
Yes.

406
00:26:37,466 --> 00:26:40,594
Hey. Look, I try to support
black-owned businesses,

407
00:26:40,703 --> 00:26:43,536
but this is absolutely ridiculous.
Take me home now.

408
00:26:43,639 --> 00:26:44,970
Monty.

409
00:26:45,074 --> 00:26:47,008
- Ms. Rossmore.
- Maya, what are you doing here?

410
00:26:47,109 --> 00:26:49,577
I live next door to Monty, your driver.

411
00:26:49,678 --> 00:26:52,203
Well, he's not my driver after tonight.
Thank you very much.

412
00:26:52,314 --> 00:26:55,408
The next time you wanna recommend
a little car service to me, Maya,

413
00:26:55,517 --> 00:26:58,042
make sure it's not one of your buddies
from the hood, okay?

414
00:26:58,153 --> 00:27:00,781
- Maya, what happened?
- Well, there was a fire and then...

415
00:27:00,889 --> 00:27:04,416
- Jennifer Jackson, Monty James?
- Yeah.

416
00:27:04,526 --> 00:27:08,189
- Laurie Bell, Department of Social Services.
- Are my kids all right? Where are they at?

417
00:27:08,297 --> 00:27:11,733
They're fine. They're being looked after.
Mr. James, this could have been really bad.

418
00:27:11,834 --> 00:27:14,564
I know. I know. I had to work tonight.

419
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:17,605
And the oldest one, she old enough
to look after the little ones.

420
00:27:17,706 --> 00:27:19,503
- And I live right next door.
- This is my neighbor.

421
00:27:19,608 --> 00:27:21,667
Well, your daughter started a fire.

422
00:27:21,777 --> 00:27:24,302
Now, I'm sure it was an accident,
and the fire wasn't that bad,

423
00:27:24,413 --> 00:27:26,779
but if your neighbor had not
broken down the door,

424
00:27:26,882 --> 00:27:28,816
your daughters could have died
of smoke inhalation.

425
00:27:28,917 --> 00:27:31,886
Now we're gonna have to look after
your daughters for a little while.

426
00:27:31,987 --> 00:27:33,284
No, no, no. No, it's a mistake.

427
00:27:33,388 --> 00:27:35,879
It's a mistake that could have
gotten them killed, Mr. James.

428
00:27:35,991 --> 00:27:38,152
Now, you'll get a call about visitation,

429
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:40,228
but for now,
they're in custody of their mother.

430
00:27:40,329 --> 00:27:43,162
No, ma'am. No, no. No.

431
00:27:45,467 --> 00:27:47,628
Let me talk to the little one, please?

432
00:27:47,736 --> 00:27:50,569
- Mr. James. Mr. James. I'm sorry.
- Look. All right. All right. Look.

433
00:27:50,672 --> 00:27:52,799
- Go get my kids. Just go get my kids.
- Come on, Ms. Jackson.

434
00:27:52,908 --> 00:27:54,034
Hold on. Ms. Bell.

435
00:27:54,143 --> 00:27:57,704
And my mother had the nerve to think
that you would do a better job than me.

436
00:27:57,813 --> 00:28:00,782
So I guess this, right here, is a better job?

437
00:28:00,883 --> 00:28:02,851
- Almost killing my kids?
- Just go get them.

438
00:28:02,951 --> 00:28:04,646
No, go get nothing.

439
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:11,016
You know we gonna get custody now,
right?

440
00:28:11,126 --> 00:28:13,321
- I'm gonna enjoy raising your little girls.
- Monty!

441
00:28:13,428 --> 00:28:16,226
- You wanna start with me, Monty?
- Give me a reason!

442
00:28:16,331 --> 00:28:18,128
- You wanna start with me, Monty?
- Monty!

443
00:28:18,233 --> 00:28:20,167
You picked the wrong person to mess with.

444
00:28:22,171 --> 00:28:25,538
All right. Just let me get my kids, man.
Just let me get my kids, man.

445
00:28:25,641 --> 00:28:27,108
Got you, player.

446
00:28:27,209 --> 00:28:29,074
- What did you say?
- Monty.

447
00:28:50,532 --> 00:28:52,022
Is he gonna take me home?

448
00:29:00,876 --> 00:29:02,741
How old are your girls?

449
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,914
Five, seven and 12.

450
00:29:09,818 --> 00:29:12,810
Look, I'm sorry about before.

451
00:29:12,921 --> 00:29:14,616
Are they gonna be okay?

452
00:29:17,993 --> 00:29:21,121
If you don't mind,
I don't want to talk about it.

453
00:29:22,798 --> 00:29:24,163
I'm sorry.

454
00:30:14,615 --> 00:30:17,106
Yeah. He's walking in right now.

455
00:30:18,786 --> 00:30:21,186
I promise you I'll take care of it myself.

456
00:30:21,289 --> 00:30:25,055
Please. Please, forgive him.
Thank you for your business.

457
00:30:28,396 --> 00:30:31,365
What? I told you I couldn't do it.

458
00:30:31,465 --> 00:30:34,366
I told you, man.
I'm glad she called and fired me.

459
00:30:34,468 --> 00:30:36,629
You feel sorry for them girls.

460
00:30:36,737 --> 00:30:40,730
- Did you get that court date yet?
- Custody hearing is in seven days.

461
00:30:40,841 --> 00:30:43,867
I called like nine lawyers this morning.

462
00:30:43,978 --> 00:30:46,845
They all said the same thing,
they need more money and more time.

463
00:30:46,948 --> 00:30:48,006
Don't look at me.

464
00:30:48,115 --> 00:30:50,345
I just feel like, you know,
I make two steps forward,

465
00:30:50,451 --> 00:30:52,112
I gotta make four steps back.

466
00:30:52,219 --> 00:30:54,653
All Ms. Kat asked me to do
was raise them kids

467
00:30:56,390 --> 00:30:57,880
and I can't even do that.

468
00:30:57,992 --> 00:31:00,654
You know, Jennifer and that crack dealer?

469
00:31:00,761 --> 00:31:02,490
They got long money.

470
00:31:03,965 --> 00:31:08,459
You gonna need some help from God
and two more white people to fight them.

471
00:31:11,572 --> 00:31:16,600
<i>So my assignment today is to encourage
your faith by using what Paul said.</i>

472
00:31:16,711 --> 00:31:20,807
<i>He says, "And let us not grow weary
in well doing. "</i>

473
00:31:20,915 --> 00:31:26,649
<i>He said, "For in due season you
shall reap, if you faint not. "</i>

474
00:31:26,754 --> 00:31:32,124
<i>Now what I'm trying to tell you
is that God is faithful.</i>

475
00:31:32,259 --> 00:31:36,753
<i>And in his faithfulness,
he reminds us that in doing good,</i>

476
00:31:36,864 --> 00:31:38,263
<i>you shall get weary.</i>

477
00:31:38,366 --> 00:31:41,733
<i>There's no sin in getting weary.
The sin is giving up.</i>

478
00:31:41,836 --> 00:31:43,269
<i>Because I'm here to announce to you</i>

479
00:31:43,371 --> 00:31:46,499
<i>you're so close to your due season,
you're about to taste it.</i>

480
00:31:46,607 --> 00:31:50,873
<i>There's about to be
a manifestation of God in your life</i>

481
00:31:50,978 --> 00:31:54,744
<i>and it's not time to throw in the towel.</i>

482
00:31:54,849 --> 00:31:59,411
<i>It's time to lift up your head because
something's about to happen in your life,</i>

483
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,579
<i>and God's gonna ensure it.</i>

484
00:32:01,689 --> 00:32:05,056
<i>The evidence that you're so close
to your breakthrough,</i>

485
00:32:05,159 --> 00:32:09,027
<i>the evidence that you're so close
to your payday and your reward</i>

486
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:12,190
<i>for walking righteous,
is that you will feel like...</i>

487
00:32:12,299 --> 00:32:14,290
<i>You better hear this,
I'm telling you something.</i>

488
00:32:14,402 --> 00:32:17,200
<i>You will feel like you're about to faint.</i>

489
00:32:17,304 --> 00:32:21,468
<i>And when you feel like
you're about to faint, don't faint.</i>

490
00:32:21,575 --> 00:32:25,067
<i>Because that says
that I'm right there next to my miracle.</i>

491
00:32:25,179 --> 00:32:29,081
<i>I'm right there,
right at the door of my due season.</i>

492
00:32:29,183 --> 00:32:32,118
<i>I'm talking to those
that walked into this church today</i>

493
00:32:32,219 --> 00:32:33,982
<i>with their head kind of hung down,</i>

494
00:32:34,088 --> 00:32:37,353
<i>and just about to give up
and about to lose your faith.</i>

495
00:32:37,458 --> 00:32:39,824
<i>I'm encouraging you, keep the faith.</i>

496
00:32:39,927 --> 00:32:42,760
<i>Stay right there. Don't faint. Hold on.</i>

497
00:32:42,863 --> 00:32:46,390
<i>God is about to bring your due season.</i>

498
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:49,731
<i>And you need to give him praise,
you need to bless his name,</i>

499
00:32:49,837 --> 00:32:52,499
<i>you need to tell him, "I'm still holding on."</i>

500
00:32:52,606 --> 00:32:56,098
<i>God bless you. God bless you.
And God bless you.</i>

501
00:33:09,323 --> 00:33:12,156
You know how you're working
my man's nerve with that whining?

502
00:33:12,259 --> 00:33:14,887
You think I'm gonna let you
come in between me and my man

503
00:33:14,995 --> 00:33:17,054
with all that mess? You're gonna stop that.

504
00:33:17,164 --> 00:33:21,601
- I want my daddy.
- Well, you ain't going back to your daddy.

505
00:33:21,702 --> 00:33:24,000
- Why?
- Because I said so, that's why.

506
00:33:24,105 --> 00:33:26,596
You're gonna stay right here with me.

507
00:33:27,575 --> 00:33:29,008
And you're going...

508
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:32,637
China, you gonna stop that whining.
China, get in there. Get in there.

509
00:33:32,746 --> 00:33:35,214
You gonna stay here with me.
You ain't going back to your daddy.

510
00:33:35,316 --> 00:33:38,683
Now you get in there
until you figure that out. Get in there.

511
00:33:40,488 --> 00:33:43,821
Lauryn, go in there with her.
Go talk to your sister.

512
00:33:46,293 --> 00:33:47,851
I gotta tell you something now.

513
00:33:47,962 --> 00:33:50,624
Y'all better be glad I know Jesus.

514
00:33:51,465 --> 00:33:53,490
How y'all get on my nerves.

515
00:34:40,547 --> 00:34:42,014
Really beautiful.

516
00:34:43,483 --> 00:34:47,044
Selling drugs right out here
in front of this holy place.

517
00:34:47,954 --> 00:34:51,082
Oh, my goodness.
You know what, they need to be stopped.

518
00:34:51,191 --> 00:34:55,127
Janice's son got caught selling at school,
he said he got it from him.

519
00:34:55,228 --> 00:34:59,062
He comes to school and recruits the kids.
Babies, Monty.

520
00:34:59,165 --> 00:35:00,928
And then he sends them to go sell it.

521
00:35:01,034 --> 00:35:03,867
You know, Monty, you really need to come
to this community meeting.

522
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:06,336
Monty, a lot of people respect you
in this neighborhood.

523
00:35:06,439 --> 00:35:08,634
And they still remember.

524
00:35:08,741 --> 00:35:11,710
- You should come to one of the meetings.
- I know.

525
00:35:11,811 --> 00:35:15,269
I'm praying for you,
and for you to get your girls back.

526
00:35:16,249 --> 00:35:19,116
- I'll babysit any time I can.
- I'll babysit, too.

527
00:35:19,219 --> 00:35:23,246
Honey, the Devil never wins,
unless you don't fight.

528
00:35:23,356 --> 00:35:25,119
Yeah. You're right.

529
00:35:25,225 --> 00:35:28,126
- All right, well, I'll see y'all later.
- Okay, baby.

530
00:35:29,963 --> 00:35:32,557
I'm going back in for a piece of cake.

531
00:35:36,202 --> 00:35:40,161
Now, you know, baby. You're old enough
to understand some things. Okay?

532
00:35:40,273 --> 00:35:42,002
All right?

533
00:35:42,108 --> 00:35:47,171
Now, you ain't gonna just be
sitting around here living off of me.

534
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,747
You got that?

535
00:35:50,149 --> 00:35:52,913
Hey, look at me while I'm talking to you.

536
00:35:53,486 --> 00:35:56,785
Look at me while I'm talking to you, I said.

537
00:35:56,889 --> 00:35:59,653
Don't you dare not look at me.

538
00:36:03,096 --> 00:36:05,894
- It's time for you to start your own hustle.
- No.

539
00:36:05,999 --> 00:36:07,626
What do you mean, "No"?

540
00:36:08,868 --> 00:36:10,426
- Are you telling me...
- I'm not a hustler.

541
00:36:10,536 --> 00:36:13,733
No, you gonna be
whatever I tell you you gonna be.

542
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:17,003
I'm trying to teach you how never
to be broke another day in your life.

543
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:19,772
The number one rule to the game

544
00:36:19,879 --> 00:36:22,643
is never get caught.

545
00:36:23,683 --> 00:36:25,082
You got that?

546
00:36:29,756 --> 00:36:31,951
Now, I'm about to go get a drink.

547
00:36:32,792 --> 00:36:34,259
You want one?

548
00:36:39,699 --> 00:36:42,361
Willie's Garage. Can I help you?

549
00:36:42,468 --> 00:36:45,631
- Hold on. Monty, telephone.
- Yo.

550
00:36:51,978 --> 00:36:53,036
Yeah.

551
00:36:54,981 --> 00:36:56,005
What?

552
00:36:59,652 --> 00:37:01,916
We called her mother
but no one answered.

553
00:37:02,021 --> 00:37:04,581
This kind of thing is frowned upon,
Mr. James.

554
00:37:05,525 --> 00:37:06,719
Yes, sir.

555
00:37:07,694 --> 00:37:10,686
Sisi, where did you get this from? Huh?

556
00:37:11,631 --> 00:37:14,464
- Go ahead and answer me.
- Joe.

557
00:37:14,567 --> 00:37:15,727
Joe gave you this?

558
00:37:15,835 --> 00:37:18,565
- Who is Joe?
- Joe's her mother's boyfriend.

559
00:37:18,671 --> 00:37:20,901
What is wrong with you, Sisi?

560
00:37:21,007 --> 00:37:24,135
- Did you lose your mind?
- I don't want you to die.

561
00:37:24,243 --> 00:37:25,972
What are you talking about?

562
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:30,311
He said if I didn't do it, he was going
to get one of his boys to take you out.

563
00:37:30,416 --> 00:37:33,385
And Joe crazy, Daddy.
He'll do it. I know he will.

564
00:37:33,486 --> 00:37:34,783
It's okay.

565
00:37:35,655 --> 00:37:38,089
Hey, didn't I tell you not to call him?
These are my kids.

566
00:37:38,191 --> 00:37:40,591
- Please.
- He has no right to my kids.

567
00:37:40,693 --> 00:37:42,627
Did you give this to my daughter to sell?

568
00:37:42,729 --> 00:37:44,560
- Is this punk talking to me?
- No, I don't think so.

569
00:37:44,664 --> 00:37:46,256
I'll take that as a yes. Look, man...

570
00:37:46,366 --> 00:37:47,958
Daddy!

571
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:51,664
Look at him, you git.

572
00:37:51,771 --> 00:37:53,238
- Security, get up here.
- You wanna play?

573
00:37:53,339 --> 00:37:56,240
- Daddy!
- Now. Right away, to the Principal's office.

574
00:37:56,342 --> 00:37:58,333
- Let him go!
- I run this, man.

575
00:37:58,444 --> 00:38:00,412
Ain't nothing you can do about it.
These are my streets.

576
00:38:00,513 --> 00:38:01,605
It's okay, baby.

577
00:38:01,714 --> 00:38:04,239
Do yourself a favor, Monty, live.

578
00:38:04,350 --> 00:38:07,911
'Cause if you keep coming at me
the way you coming at me,

579
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:11,353
we won't need a custody hearing.
You heard me?

580
00:38:11,457 --> 00:38:13,482
- Stop it, Sierra.
- Let go. Come here.

581
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:16,927
Daddy's all right. Daddy's all right.

582
00:38:17,029 --> 00:38:19,589
- Daddy, please, can we go with you?
- Sierra, come on.

583
00:38:19,699 --> 00:38:20,791
- Sierra.
- Please.

584
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:23,494
It's gonna be all right.
It's gonna be all right.

585
00:38:23,603 --> 00:38:25,867
- Sierra, come on.
- Let me go!

586
00:38:25,972 --> 00:38:27,872
Stop it. Both of you.

587
00:38:28,875 --> 00:38:31,309
- Stop grabbing her like that.
- What you doing, Sierra?

588
00:38:31,411 --> 00:38:33,379
It's gonna be all right, Sisi. All right?

589
00:38:33,479 --> 00:38:35,947
Why you gotta come up in here...

590
00:38:36,048 --> 00:38:37,606
If you come up in front of me again,

591
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:40,878
I swear to God, you'll never see
another daylight in your life.

592
00:39:02,008 --> 00:39:03,635
- Morning.
- Hi.

593
00:39:06,279 --> 00:39:07,576
Excuse me.

594
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:11,048
...and your 8:00 appointment's all set.
- Okay.

595
00:39:11,149 --> 00:39:12,207
Mr. Farnberg called.

596
00:39:12,317 --> 00:39:15,480
Oh, and I was able to reschedule
your hair appointment for next Tuesday.

597
00:39:15,587 --> 00:39:16,986
Also...

598
00:39:17,088 --> 00:39:19,886
- Hey, what are you doing in here?
- I needed to talk to you.

599
00:39:19,991 --> 00:39:21,982
That's what I was trying to tell you.
Mr. James is here.

600
00:39:22,093 --> 00:39:24,323
Yeah, obviously.
Did you just let him in my office?

601
00:39:24,429 --> 00:39:26,989
Well, he said he's here to drive you home.

602
00:39:27,098 --> 00:39:29,532
- Call security.
- No, you ain't gotta call security.

603
00:39:29,634 --> 00:39:32,000
I don't know what I was thinking
coming here talking to you.

604
00:39:32,103 --> 00:39:34,094
I'll just leave. I'm going.

605
00:39:34,206 --> 00:39:36,174
What do you want from me?

606
00:39:37,609 --> 00:39:40,077
I gotta talk to you about my kids.

607
00:39:44,249 --> 00:39:47,480
- Maya, can you give us a second, please?
- Yes, ma'am.

608
00:39:50,789 --> 00:39:53,485
I gotta get my girls back.

609
00:39:53,625 --> 00:39:56,150
Okay, what you need
is a family law attorney.

610
00:39:56,261 --> 00:39:58,525
Okay? And if you can't afford one,
the court will appoint one.

611
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:00,222
I can't walk in there with a public lawyer.

612
00:40:00,332 --> 00:40:02,323
Their mama's spending
a lot of money on a lawyer.

613
00:40:02,434 --> 00:40:05,369
And I need a bulldog like you. No offense.

614
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:09,305
Look, our firm charges $500 an hour.
Can you afford that?

615
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:11,875
- I got $1,200 to my name.
- Look, Mr...

616
00:40:11,977 --> 00:40:14,275
No, no, just call me Monty.
Look, sister, I'm trying to get...

617
00:40:14,379 --> 00:40:16,347
Typical. Typical.

618
00:40:16,448 --> 00:40:19,679
I thought more of you, but it's real
typical. I'm not your sister, okay?

619
00:40:19,784 --> 00:40:23,743
I don't appreciate you coming
into my office asking for favors,

620
00:40:23,855 --> 00:40:25,322
playing the race thing.

621
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:27,152
It's sad and it's pathetic.

622
00:40:28,727 --> 00:40:31,161
- What are you getting out of this?
- What?

623
00:40:31,263 --> 00:40:33,356
Why do you want your daughters back
so badly?

624
00:40:33,465 --> 00:40:37,526
You getting a check for them
or some sort of government assistance?

625
00:40:37,636 --> 00:40:38,830
Go to hell.

626
00:40:38,937 --> 00:40:42,395
Well, that, my friend, is exactly
how you get what you want.

627
00:40:42,507 --> 00:40:46,637
Insult me. Great strategy.
I see why you're so successful.

628
00:40:48,013 --> 00:40:49,844
Get a man. Get a life.

629
00:40:51,283 --> 00:40:52,580
Thank you.

630
00:40:59,324 --> 00:41:00,985
Excuse me, are any of you ladies
named Julia?

631
00:41:01,092 --> 00:41:02,184
- No.
- No.

632
00:41:02,294 --> 00:41:03,761
Sorry to bother you.

633
00:41:09,568 --> 00:41:10,796
Julia.

634
00:41:10,902 --> 00:41:12,631
- Christopher?
- Yes.

635
00:41:12,737 --> 00:41:14,830
- Please, call me Chris.
- Sure.

636
00:41:15,774 --> 00:41:17,708
- May I?
- Oh, please. Sorry.

637
00:41:24,082 --> 00:41:25,674
I'm sorry for staring.

638
00:41:25,784 --> 00:41:28,844
It's just that you're more beautiful
than your friend said.

639
00:41:28,954 --> 00:41:32,014
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

640
00:41:32,123 --> 00:41:35,024
- So you're a lawyer?
- Yes, I am.

641
00:41:35,126 --> 00:41:37,651
- Me, too.
- Really? Wow.

642
00:41:37,762 --> 00:41:41,220
Mostly corporate stuff, tax stuff.
It's pretty boring. What about you?

643
00:41:41,333 --> 00:41:44,427
Our firm handles some criminal, some civil.

644
00:41:44,536 --> 00:41:47,130
- Okay. What firm?
- Rossmore & Blake.

645
00:41:47,238 --> 00:41:48,262
Oh.

646
00:41:49,874 --> 00:41:52,240
- What?
- I applied for a job there.

647
00:41:52,344 --> 00:41:54,642
They turned me down.

648
00:41:54,746 --> 00:41:57,237
Said that my resume
was a little bit shallow.

649
00:41:57,349 --> 00:41:59,579
That's what the old fart said.

650
00:42:00,819 --> 00:42:05,279
- What's he... How's he doing these days?
- He retired to Florida.

651
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:09,258
- Oh, you keep up with him?
- He's my father, the fart.

652
00:42:11,796 --> 00:42:13,491
Check, please.

653
00:42:14,232 --> 00:42:17,395
- I'm sorry. That was embarrassing.
- Don't worry about it.

654
00:42:17,502 --> 00:42:20,767
He can be a little tough on people
he doesn't know that well.

655
00:42:20,872 --> 00:42:23,636
Oh, it must be big wingtips to fill.

656
00:42:23,742 --> 00:42:26,711
Actually I try to fill my own stilettos.

657
00:42:27,846 --> 00:42:30,644
Touch. And I will try to keep
my foot out of my mouth

658
00:42:30,749 --> 00:42:32,114
for the rest of this conversation.

659
00:42:32,217 --> 00:42:34,344
It's cute. You should leave it there.

660
00:42:34,452 --> 00:42:37,751
- Well, if it's what the lady likes, then I will.
- Oh, I like.

661
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:43,054
- Would you like anything to drink?
- A latte would be great.

662
00:42:43,161 --> 00:42:45,095
Okay. Coming right up.

663
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:50,864
Thank you, Jesus.

664
00:42:54,773 --> 00:42:57,003
So, I had an amazing time.

665
00:42:57,108 --> 00:43:00,703
This was one of the best dates
I've ever been on.

666
00:43:00,812 --> 00:43:02,006
Me, too.

667
00:43:02,647 --> 00:43:06,105
- I would like to see you again.
- Yeah? I'd like that.

668
00:43:09,654 --> 00:43:11,781
Who the hell is this, Chris?

669
00:43:17,028 --> 00:43:18,757
This is...

670
00:43:18,863 --> 00:43:20,228
Baby, you were supposed...

671
00:43:20,331 --> 00:43:23,789
- Who are you?
- I was just saying goodbye, ma'am.

672
00:43:23,902 --> 00:43:27,565
Yeah, you better go, slut.
You see, right now, this is his family.

673
00:43:28,239 --> 00:43:31,174
- Get away from my daddy, tramp.
- Junior!

674
00:43:31,276 --> 00:43:33,767
Excuse me, you're trying
to be playing player, huh?

675
00:43:33,878 --> 00:43:37,837
Where is your wedding ring?
That is so tired. Get into the car.

676
00:43:42,954 --> 00:43:45,787
- Where's your lawyer?
- Sir, I can't afford one.

677
00:43:45,890 --> 00:43:48,188
But I do have all my paperwork,
Your Honor.

678
00:43:48,293 --> 00:43:51,524
- Are you ready to begin?
- Yes, sir.

679
00:43:52,397 --> 00:43:54,627
- My kids were taken for...
- The court is aware of that,

680
00:43:54,733 --> 00:43:57,293
but first I'd like to hear about
the incident that happened at school.

681
00:43:57,402 --> 00:44:00,132
Your Honor, he gave my daughter weed
to sell in school

682
00:44:00,238 --> 00:44:01,636
so, you know, I had to handle that.

683
00:44:01,739 --> 00:44:04,902
Mr. James has no evidence
to support that allegation.

684
00:44:05,008 --> 00:44:07,602
However, we have documentation
that demonstrates

685
00:44:07,711 --> 00:44:10,839
that Mr. James has a history
of violent behavior.

686
00:44:10,948 --> 00:44:13,712
Your Honor, look, I'm caught between
a rock and a hard place here.

687
00:44:13,817 --> 00:44:16,615
You know, the courts won't help me.
My daughters are living with this man.

688
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:18,312
You know,
what am I supposed to do right here?

689
00:44:18,422 --> 00:44:22,119
Your Honor, not only are we requesting
full custody with no visitation,

690
00:44:22,226 --> 00:44:24,956
but also a restraining order
against Mr. James.

691
00:44:25,062 --> 00:44:27,155
He assaulted my client
and threatened bodily injury.

692
00:44:27,264 --> 00:44:29,391
You Honor, this man
is giving drugs to my kids.

693
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:31,400
- What proof of that do you have?
- Absolutely none.

694
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:33,766
- Your Honor.
- Ms. Rossmore?

695
00:44:33,871 --> 00:44:36,203
I'll be representing Mr. James.

696
00:44:36,306 --> 00:44:38,604
I'd like to request a continuance
at this time

697
00:44:38,709 --> 00:44:40,006
so I might be brought up to speed.

698
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:43,739
Your Honor, this has gone on long enough.
My client is ready to put this behind her.

699
00:44:43,847 --> 00:44:46,111
Perhaps counsel might want
to remind his client

700
00:44:46,216 --> 00:44:48,844
that in family court it's not
what's best for the parent,

701
00:44:48,952 --> 00:44:50,977
but rather what's
in the best interest of the child.

702
00:44:51,088 --> 00:44:52,749
That being said,

703
00:44:52,856 --> 00:44:55,518
I think these children
need effective counsel.

704
00:44:55,626 --> 00:44:59,858
Ms. Rossmore, you are appointed
by the court as guardian for the children.

705
00:44:59,963 --> 00:45:03,626
When I hear this case on the reset date,
I want evidence,

706
00:45:03,734 --> 00:45:07,397
not just accusations and speculation.

707
00:45:07,504 --> 00:45:09,267
This case is continued for 30 days.

708
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:11,364
Your Honor,
during that time we'd like to request

709
00:45:11,475 --> 00:45:12,840
full custody be granted to the father.

710
00:45:12,943 --> 00:45:14,638
You're pushing your luck.

711
00:45:14,745 --> 00:45:16,736
Full custody remains with the mother.

712
00:45:16,847 --> 00:45:20,248
Father will have visitation one day a week.
Adjourned.

713
00:45:23,754 --> 00:45:26,655
You have really interesting taste in women.

714
00:45:28,492 --> 00:45:31,518
No, that's not the girl I met in high school.

715
00:45:31,628 --> 00:45:32,890
Nope, she's changed.

716
00:45:32,996 --> 00:45:36,693
I think the hood has a way of bringing out
the best and the worst in people.

717
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:39,826
That's not just the hood, Monty. That's life.

718
00:45:39,937 --> 00:45:41,905
Yeah, maybe you're right.

719
00:45:42,005 --> 00:45:44,803
We had big dreams, though. Big dreams.

720
00:45:44,908 --> 00:45:47,274
Then I guess, you know, reality set in.

721
00:45:47,377 --> 00:45:50,437
Really? What kind of dreams did you have?

722
00:45:50,547 --> 00:45:53,983
I'm a mechanic and, you know,
I wanted to open my own shop.

723
00:45:54,084 --> 00:45:56,678
I'm good with cars, you know.
So that's my hustle.

724
00:45:56,787 --> 00:45:58,550
You should open that shop one day.

725
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:02,022
Well, I had to use the money
that I had saved on my kids.

726
00:46:02,125 --> 00:46:04,093
- Oh.
- It was worth it, though.

727
00:46:04,194 --> 00:46:05,889
You know, I think that parents sometimes,

728
00:46:05,996 --> 00:46:09,625
they gotta give up their dreams
so their kids can have one.

729
00:46:14,738 --> 00:46:16,205
Thank you.

730
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:18,474
- Thank you so much...
- All right.

731
00:46:18,575 --> 00:46:20,805
...for giving me hope. Thank you.

732
00:46:23,313 --> 00:46:24,940
Great. Cool. Okay.

733
00:46:32,089 --> 00:46:35,354
Come by tomorrow evening after work. We're
gonna have to do all this after-hours.

734
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:37,222
- Okay.
- And if you could bring any receipt

735
00:46:37,327 --> 00:46:40,592
that pertains to the kids' expenses
or anything else you can possibly think of

736
00:46:40,697 --> 00:46:42,927
- that can help us win the case.
- Thank you.

737
00:46:51,408 --> 00:46:53,137
No, no, no. This needs to be addressed.

738
00:46:53,243 --> 00:46:55,837
He is the councilman.
He needs to know what the real issues are.

739
00:46:55,946 --> 00:46:58,039
You the one we elected.
You supposed to do something.

740
00:46:58,148 --> 00:46:59,410
- That's what.
- That's right.

741
00:46:59,516 --> 00:47:03,145
Quiet, quiet, please.
One at a time. One at a time.

742
00:47:03,253 --> 00:47:04,914
Yes, you, ma'am.

743
00:47:05,022 --> 00:47:09,391
I'm scared to go to the mailbox on
the first because they be watching me.

744
00:47:12,262 --> 00:47:13,524
Yes, sir.

745
00:47:14,231 --> 00:47:17,632
That Joe boy's been selling drugs
on this block for years.

746
00:47:17,734 --> 00:47:21,033
- Why haven't you called the police?
- What good would that do?

747
00:47:21,138 --> 00:47:24,665
He's been arrested five times
and he keeps coming back.

748
00:47:25,442 --> 00:47:28,138
- You gotta do something.
- That's right.

749
00:47:28,245 --> 00:47:30,577
What did I miss?

750
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:33,115
More of the same. Still complaining.

751
00:47:33,216 --> 00:47:36,379
Let me tell you why
he's gonna keep getting off.

752
00:47:36,486 --> 00:47:40,718
Because none of you in this neighborhood
will testify against him.

753
00:47:43,894 --> 00:47:48,092
What if we did?
I mean, what if we did testify?

754
00:47:48,198 --> 00:47:50,063
Who's gonna protect us?

755
00:47:52,636 --> 00:47:57,369
Police don't come when you call them
in this neighborhood half the time.

756
00:47:57,474 --> 00:47:59,669
- May I say something, please?
- Yes, sir.

757
00:47:59,776 --> 00:48:02,745
I've been in this neighborhood
for almost 67 years.

758
00:48:02,846 --> 00:48:07,476
I've watched Dr. King walk this very street
to go to the barbershop.

759
00:48:07,584 --> 00:48:09,381
I remember Billie Holiday

760
00:48:09,486 --> 00:48:13,616
who checked into what used to be
the only hotel in the South

761
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:18,354
that would allow black people,
right here on Auburn Avenue.

762
00:48:18,462 --> 00:48:23,229
What I remember most is we used to be a
people that would take care of ourselves.

763
00:48:23,333 --> 00:48:27,326
Nobody never gave us nothing.
We all earned it.

764
00:48:27,437 --> 00:48:31,464
We look at these politicians and ask
that they help. It ain't up to them.

765
00:48:31,575 --> 00:48:33,406
It's up to us.

766
00:48:33,510 --> 00:48:37,571
And if we all stand up together,
then maybe they'll come and help us.

767
00:48:37,681 --> 00:48:40,275
That's the history of us as a people.

768
00:48:42,219 --> 00:48:44,653
We have to get our neighborhood back.

769
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:49,923
I can see my whole neighborhood up here.

770
00:48:50,861 --> 00:48:52,954
It ain't but five, ten blocks

771
00:48:54,397 --> 00:48:57,264
but it's a whole different world out there.

772
00:48:57,666 --> 00:49:00,658
- And the highway running right through it.
- Monty, I have a question.

773
00:49:00,770 --> 00:49:01,896
Yeah.

774
00:49:02,004 --> 00:49:04,905
When did you and their grandmother
file this with the family court?

775
00:49:05,007 --> 00:49:09,535
Oh, pardon me.
It was like a month before the fire.

776
00:49:09,645 --> 00:49:12,705
- There, see the date?
- Thank you.

777
00:49:14,216 --> 00:49:17,208
So you've been supporting
these children their whole lives?

778
00:49:17,319 --> 00:49:18,377
Yeah.

779
00:49:20,823 --> 00:49:23,553
- What?
- Nothing, you should be proud of that.

780
00:49:23,659 --> 00:49:25,593
That's all I'm saying,
you should be proud of that.

781
00:49:25,694 --> 00:49:29,460
Judging from these past years' tax returns
and how much you spend on them,

782
00:49:29,565 --> 00:49:32,033
- it's commendable.
- Don't be surprised.

783
00:49:32,134 --> 00:49:34,193
I mean, I know the world
will have you thinking that,

784
00:49:34,303 --> 00:49:38,205
you know, brothers in the hood
don't look after their kids but...

785
00:49:38,307 --> 00:49:40,832
I know there are some that don't, but I do.

786
00:49:40,943 --> 00:49:43,639
I love my kids. I want them back.

787
00:49:46,482 --> 00:49:48,950
Oh, well, you know, I think...

788
00:49:49,051 --> 00:49:53,988
I think we have enough info here to begin
preparing a really, really solid case.

789
00:49:54,090 --> 00:49:56,456
You know, there is something
I have to ask, though.

790
00:49:56,559 --> 00:49:57,548
Yeah.

791
00:49:57,660 --> 00:50:00,686
Are there any surprises in your past
that I should know about?

792
00:50:03,766 --> 00:50:05,427
Sorry. I'm sorry.

793
00:50:06,635 --> 00:50:07,727
Yes.

794
00:50:08,671 --> 00:50:12,573
Cynthia, no. No, no, no.
I know it's 6:30. I'm not going.

795
00:50:13,809 --> 00:50:16,972
'Cause I don't want to go
on any more blind dates.

796
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:22,016
He was a 40-year-old rapper.
No, I didn't hear his demo tape.

797
00:50:22,118 --> 00:50:24,678
Bye. Bye. Thank you, bye.

798
00:50:26,222 --> 00:50:27,314
Sorry.

799
00:50:27,423 --> 00:50:30,586
Why do you...
Why do you go on them dates?

800
00:50:32,061 --> 00:50:34,552
- Why do you go on them blind dates?
- Excuse me.

801
00:50:34,663 --> 00:50:38,224
When I was driving you, you know, you had
your homegirl set you up on a blind date.

802
00:50:38,334 --> 00:50:42,270
And I'm like,
"Why you need that? You're so beautiful."

803
00:50:42,404 --> 00:50:44,872
You really want to know?

804
00:50:44,974 --> 00:50:47,807
I need... I mean, I need to know. I mean...

805
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:55,113
Because it's really hard
to meet a nice black man.

806
00:50:55,217 --> 00:50:57,117
It is. It is.

807
00:50:57,219 --> 00:50:59,517
And when you're in corporate America,
like me,

808
00:50:59,622 --> 00:51:01,487
the people you work with
don't look like you.

809
00:51:01,590 --> 00:51:04,252
And if you're a black woman
that wants to actually date a black man,

810
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:05,884
kind of difficult.

811
00:51:05,995 --> 00:51:09,453
No, seriously, and if you want a black man
that has good credit,

812
00:51:09,565 --> 00:51:12,625
actually wants to date a black woman

813
00:51:12,735 --> 00:51:16,068
and doesn't play video games.

814
00:51:16,172 --> 00:51:19,164
- Good luck.
- I love me some black women.

815
00:51:31,654 --> 00:51:33,246
Where's my money?

816
00:51:34,423 --> 00:51:37,221
- I don't have it.
- We can see that.

817
00:51:37,326 --> 00:51:39,760
That's $700, kid.

818
00:51:39,862 --> 00:51:43,491
See, now, the problem is
that comes from queen bee's account.

819
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:46,727
And as you can see,
she's a little pissed off about it.

820
00:51:48,103 --> 00:51:50,970
Baby, you want to call this one?

821
00:51:51,073 --> 00:51:53,667
- Oh, baby, you're going to let me do it?
- Oh, for sure.

822
00:51:53,776 --> 00:51:55,505
Go do what you do.

823
00:51:58,147 --> 00:51:59,409
Now, kick his ass.

824
00:52:01,150 --> 00:52:02,447
$150.

825
00:52:03,352 --> 00:52:04,785
$275.

826
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:07,714
- That's a good $350 right there.
- Stop it!

827
00:52:08,958 --> 00:52:10,289
Stop it!

828
00:52:10,392 --> 00:52:11,882
Get him up out of here.
Get him up out of here.

829
00:52:11,994 --> 00:52:13,256
Get him up out of here.

830
00:52:13,362 --> 00:52:16,297
Yo, light up my blowtorch.
I'll be down in about 20 minutes.

831
00:52:17,132 --> 00:52:18,929
What you laughing for? That ain't funny.

832
00:52:19,034 --> 00:52:22,868
I'm laughing at you 'cause...

833
00:52:22,972 --> 00:52:25,873
Baby, he deserves to be beat, okay?

834
00:52:25,975 --> 00:52:29,138
It's a tough world out here
and I'm getting you ready for it.

835
00:52:29,245 --> 00:52:33,238
Ain't nothing given to you, girl.
No, you got to take it.

836
00:52:33,349 --> 00:52:36,944
Now, I'm gonna wipe those
little sweet dreams out of your head,

837
00:52:37,052 --> 00:52:39,782
okay, baby,
if it's not the last thing that I do.

838
00:52:39,888 --> 00:52:43,119
Now, get your little black ass
back in that bedroom

839
00:52:43,225 --> 00:52:45,386
before I have to smack it.

840
00:52:45,494 --> 00:52:49,123
Oh, I'm about to come in there in a minute.
I got a big belt.

841
00:52:49,231 --> 00:52:51,665
Okay, I think that's enough for tonight.

842
00:52:51,767 --> 00:52:55,032
- So, how's it looking?
- Good, good. I think we're gonna do well.

843
00:52:56,839 --> 00:52:59,603
- Come on, I'll walk you to your car.
- Thank you.

844
00:53:00,976 --> 00:53:04,275
You know what?
I forgot, I let my driver go home early.

845
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:06,541
Oh, well, you know, I'll take you home.

846
00:53:07,650 --> 00:53:09,117
Thank you.

847
00:53:09,218 --> 00:53:11,778
- Is this how you're spending your birthday?
- It's just another day.

848
00:53:11,887 --> 00:53:13,650
Wow, how old are you?

849
00:53:14,523 --> 00:53:17,890
- You don't ask a woman that.
- I just did. How old are you?

850
00:53:17,993 --> 00:53:20,188
- How old are you?
- Thirty-four.

851
00:53:23,232 --> 00:53:24,494
Twenty-twelve.

852
00:53:26,435 --> 00:53:28,426
Okay. Happy birthday.

853
00:53:32,908 --> 00:53:35,103
What are you going home to do?

854
00:53:36,378 --> 00:53:39,711
I got some paperwork
I got to catch up on, stuff like that.

855
00:53:41,550 --> 00:53:45,451
I mean, that ain't how you're
supposed to spend your birthday.

856
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:48,582
You need to get out and have some fun.

857
00:53:49,290 --> 00:53:52,953
What's fun? I don't even know what that is.

858
00:53:53,061 --> 00:53:54,995
All I do is work.

859
00:53:55,096 --> 00:53:57,656
Fun is where you make it.

860
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:01,761
Come on, I'll show you some fun.

861
00:54:27,128 --> 00:54:29,153
You know, I don't think
this is gonna be a good idea.

862
00:54:29,263 --> 00:54:30,628
Sure it is.

863
00:54:31,632 --> 00:54:32,929
Is it safe?

864
00:54:33,735 --> 00:54:36,397
You're always safe with me. Come on.

865
00:54:37,472 --> 00:54:38,666
Come on.

866
00:54:39,941 --> 00:54:41,340
What's up, man?

867
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:14,340
Hey, Karen.

868
00:55:14,442 --> 00:55:17,570
- Did you buy that garage yet?
- I'm still working on it, you know that.

869
00:55:17,678 --> 00:55:19,839
- This is my friend Julia. Julia, Karen.
- Hey.

870
00:55:19,947 --> 00:55:22,313
- Hey.
- And she need a drink, okay?

871
00:55:24,051 --> 00:55:26,076
You ain't lying.

872
00:55:26,187 --> 00:55:27,711
I know just the thing.

873
00:56:36,991 --> 00:56:38,458
You all right?

874
00:57:01,148 --> 00:57:02,877
Y'all have a good time.

875
00:57:03,718 --> 00:57:05,185
Monty.

876
00:57:06,454 --> 00:57:09,116
- This is my friend Julia.
- Hello, pretty lady.

877
00:57:09,223 --> 00:57:10,554
- How are you doing?
- Fine.

878
00:57:10,658 --> 00:57:13,650
Good to see you. She looks scared.

879
00:57:13,761 --> 00:57:16,059
No, I'm fine. No, really, I'm fine.

880
00:57:16,163 --> 00:57:17,858
It's all right, baby.
We're gonna make you comfortable.

881
00:57:17,965 --> 00:57:19,990
Karen, get us a couple
of them down South brews, please.

882
00:57:20,101 --> 00:57:21,568
By the way, it's her birthday today.

883
00:57:21,669 --> 00:57:24,832
Well, that's a reason to drink.
Happy birthday.

884
00:57:24,939 --> 00:57:26,065
Yeah.

885
00:57:27,241 --> 00:57:30,176
- Take that to you.
- What is it?

886
00:57:30,278 --> 00:57:32,838
Oh, no, no.
Just hold your nose and swallow.

887
00:57:33,814 --> 00:57:36,510
Unless you're scared.
If you're scared, let me take that for you.

888
00:57:36,617 --> 00:57:37,914
No.

889
00:57:38,286 --> 00:57:39,480
Sure?

890
00:57:47,161 --> 00:57:49,755
- Wait now, wait a second. Wait.
- Happy birthday.

891
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,195
- Happy birthday.
- Happy birthday, baby.

892
00:57:55,303 --> 00:57:58,136
- Happy birthday.
- Are you all right?

893
00:57:58,239 --> 00:58:00,469
There's water right here.

894
00:58:00,575 --> 00:58:03,135
Give me another one.
I'm trying to catch up with her.

895
00:58:07,214 --> 00:58:09,978
- Please, do. Please, do.
- Seems like a nice girl.

896
00:58:10,084 --> 00:58:12,985
Yeah, she a little too white bread for me.

897
00:58:13,087 --> 00:58:16,022
- Where did you meet her?
- I was her driver.

898
00:58:18,059 --> 00:58:19,253
Be careful.

899
00:58:25,132 --> 00:58:27,327
- You all right?
- Dance with me.

900
00:58:28,936 --> 00:58:30,028
Sure.

901
00:59:31,965 --> 00:59:34,627
All right, have you got the keys?
No, let me help you with that.

902
00:59:34,734 --> 00:59:37,669
Wait, wait, wait.
Are you sure you live here?

903
00:59:45,345 --> 00:59:48,041
Who put this couch here?

904
00:59:48,148 --> 00:59:51,845
It was a bad boy. It was a bad boy.

905
00:59:51,951 --> 00:59:54,419
Okay, Julia, where the kitchen at?

906
00:59:55,388 --> 00:59:56,582
That way?

907
00:59:58,224 --> 00:59:59,486
Yeah.

908
01:00:03,163 --> 01:00:04,130
What?

909
01:00:04,230 --> 01:00:06,994
I told you
you was gonna have some fun, right?

910
01:00:18,978 --> 01:00:20,912
I got something for you.

911
01:00:27,554 --> 01:00:28,680
Julia.

912
01:00:30,390 --> 01:00:32,051
Where's she go?

913
01:00:37,997 --> 01:00:39,123
Julia.

914
01:00:51,511 --> 01:00:52,978
Oh, okay.

915
01:00:53,980 --> 01:00:56,278
You knocked out, ain't you?

916
01:00:59,352 --> 01:01:00,376
Hey.

917
01:01:02,622 --> 01:01:06,888
You got some aspirin, something like that?

918
01:01:06,993 --> 01:01:08,585
Okay.

919
01:01:08,695 --> 01:01:10,458
Let me set you up.

920
01:01:29,983 --> 01:01:31,541
Oh, man.

921
01:01:43,730 --> 01:01:45,061
Here, baby.

922
01:01:46,166 --> 01:01:48,293
- Come here.
- Come here.

923
01:01:48,401 --> 01:01:49,595
I have to leave.

924
01:01:49,702 --> 01:01:51,363
- Come here.
- Take that.

925
01:01:58,077 --> 01:02:01,740
- It'll make you feel better, okay?
- You make me feel better.

926
01:02:01,848 --> 01:02:04,783
- I do?
- You make me feel way better.

927
01:02:05,451 --> 01:02:06,884
Stay the night.

928
01:02:08,054 --> 01:02:09,521
- Stay with me.
- You're drunk.

929
01:02:09,622 --> 01:02:11,112
- I know.
- You know?

930
01:02:11,224 --> 01:02:12,521
- I know.
- Oh.

931
01:02:13,526 --> 01:02:14,925
Stay the night.

932
01:02:18,031 --> 01:02:21,057
I don't need ibuprofen. I need you.

933
01:02:21,167 --> 01:02:22,725
- You need me?
- I need you.

934
01:02:22,836 --> 01:02:24,269
All right, come here.

935
01:02:33,446 --> 01:02:36,176
Oh, wait. Wait a second. Yo.

936
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:41,782
You all right?

937
01:02:51,898 --> 01:02:55,629
- Baby, you want... You need...
- No. Go home, please.

938
01:02:55,735 --> 01:02:56,963
I'm okay.

939
01:02:57,937 --> 01:02:59,131
Go home?

940
01:03:00,807 --> 01:03:02,399
I'll see you tomorrow.

941
01:03:05,511 --> 01:03:08,139
- Okay.
- I had a good time. It was great jazz.

942
01:03:08,248 --> 01:03:09,840
- You had a good time? Okay.
- Great jazz.

943
01:03:09,949 --> 01:03:11,314
Me, too.

944
01:03:11,417 --> 01:03:12,475
Bye.

945
01:03:15,355 --> 01:03:18,119
Okay, I'm gonna call you tomorrow.

946
01:03:18,258 --> 01:03:20,192
I had a good time.

947
01:03:32,537 --> 01:03:34,767
Hey, sorry I'm late.

948
01:03:34,873 --> 01:03:38,036
Where have you been?
We've been calling you for days.

949
01:03:38,143 --> 01:03:41,078
- I called you twice yesterday.
- I know, I've been busy.

950
01:03:41,179 --> 01:03:44,410
- Excuse me. Coffee, ma'am?
- Yes, decaf, please. Thanks.

951
01:03:51,023 --> 01:03:53,890
- What?
- Oh, hell, no.

952
01:03:54,826 --> 01:03:56,760
What are you talking about?

953
01:03:56,862 --> 01:03:58,887
Only good sex
can make you smile like that.

954
01:03:58,997 --> 01:04:01,022
- Who is he?
- We did not have sex.

955
01:04:01,133 --> 01:04:02,691
But there's someone.

956
01:04:06,271 --> 01:04:07,738
- Who is it?
- She's glowing.

957
01:04:07,839 --> 01:04:09,636
Come on. Give up the goods, girl.

958
01:04:09,741 --> 01:04:12,335
No, no, no.
Because you're just gonna judge me.

959
01:04:12,444 --> 01:04:15,311
- 'Cause you two are judgmental.
- Oh, God.

960
01:04:16,348 --> 01:04:19,977
- Is he married?
- He's not married. I'm not a hooker.

961
01:04:20,085 --> 01:04:22,713
- Oh, well, then who is he?
- Then tell us.

962
01:04:23,422 --> 01:04:24,946
Come on.

963
01:04:25,057 --> 01:04:27,525
- His name is Monty.
- Monty.

964
01:04:27,993 --> 01:04:32,430
Oh! Oh, that guy you introduced us to.
He's the new associate. He was so fine.

965
01:04:32,531 --> 01:04:35,432
- No, no, no. His name was Brian.
- How do you know his name?

966
01:04:35,534 --> 01:04:37,729
You know, he's not an associate.

967
01:04:37,836 --> 01:04:39,565
- Do we know him?
- Monty.

968
01:04:39,671 --> 01:04:42,538
Monty. Come on.
We know him. We know Monty.

969
01:04:42,641 --> 01:04:43,972
The driver?

970
01:04:44,943 --> 01:04:47,503
- The driver?
- The driver?

971
01:04:48,246 --> 01:04:49,577
The driver?

972
01:04:50,449 --> 01:04:53,646
Oh, hell, no. Are you out of your mind?

973
01:04:53,752 --> 01:04:57,051
Okay, he's supposed to be driving you,
not you riding him.

974
01:04:57,155 --> 01:05:00,886
Wasn't it you two ladies who told me,
"Relax your standards, Julia"?

975
01:05:00,993 --> 01:05:03,723
Yeah, to relax them, honey,
not lay them down by the riverside.

976
01:05:03,829 --> 01:05:06,423
- I don't know about this.
- Where does he live?

977
01:05:08,633 --> 01:05:11,124
- Edgewood.
- Edgewood.

978
01:05:11,236 --> 01:05:12,464
- Edgewood.
- Edgewood.

979
01:05:12,571 --> 01:05:15,802
What does your lvy League background
know about Edgewood?

980
01:05:15,907 --> 01:05:16,931
Nothing.

981
01:05:17,042 --> 01:05:19,272
And what do you know about Edgewood?
Nothing.

982
01:05:19,378 --> 01:05:21,039
What could you two
possibly have to talk about?

983
01:05:21,146 --> 01:05:22,238
They ain't gonna be talking.

984
01:05:22,381 --> 01:05:23,643
- Cynthia.
- What?

985
01:05:23,749 --> 01:05:26,411
Your client's last settlement,
his baby-mama drama.

986
01:05:26,518 --> 01:05:27,951
- How do you know he has kids?
- Because.

987
01:05:28,053 --> 01:05:30,613
Are you kidding me?
It is not if he has kids, it's how many.

988
01:05:30,722 --> 01:05:32,815
- Does he have kids?
- How many?

989
01:05:32,924 --> 01:05:35,188
- Three.
- He has three children?

990
01:05:35,293 --> 01:05:36,851
I'm so disappointed.

991
01:05:36,962 --> 01:05:40,329
- Are they all by the same mother?
- Probably not.

992
01:05:40,432 --> 01:05:44,630
Yes, they all have the same mother,
I think, but it doesn't matter.

993
01:05:45,971 --> 01:05:47,700
Just be careful, don't fall for this guy.

994
01:05:47,806 --> 01:05:49,603
I'm telling you, he will run up your credit,

995
01:05:49,708 --> 01:05:52,302
have you in the SWATs wearing
knock-off Gucci before...

996
01:05:52,411 --> 01:05:55,471
Brenda, relax, all right. She's not married.

997
01:05:56,281 --> 01:05:57,771
She's just having fun.

998
01:05:57,883 --> 01:05:59,680
Right? You're having fun,
you're not falling in love.

999
01:05:59,785 --> 01:06:02,185
And she needs to have some fun.
Girl, you need to take the edge off.

1000
01:06:02,287 --> 01:06:03,379
You do.

1001
01:06:10,762 --> 01:06:12,320
- Hi.
- Whoa.

1002
01:06:12,431 --> 01:06:13,728
- Hey, hey.
- You all right?

1003
01:06:13,832 --> 01:06:15,231
- Feeling good?
- Yeah, yeah.

1004
01:06:15,333 --> 01:06:17,528
You had fun last night except for the...

1005
01:06:20,839 --> 01:06:22,329
Yeah, I'm fine.

1006
01:06:23,175 --> 01:06:24,574
What are you doing here?

1007
01:06:24,676 --> 01:06:26,940
Well, you know, I just thought
I'd come check up on you.

1008
01:06:27,045 --> 01:06:31,038
And I realized, you know, you're doing
all this work but you haven't met the girls.

1009
01:06:31,149 --> 01:06:33,777
I have them tonight so maybe
you want to come by and meet them?

1010
01:06:33,885 --> 01:06:38,447
- Great. Sounds good.
- My place ain't as fly as yours, but...

1011
01:06:38,557 --> 01:06:40,548
- How's 7:00?
- That sounds great.

1012
01:06:40,659 --> 01:06:42,092
That's great.

1013
01:06:42,194 --> 01:06:44,992
What's wrong with you? You still feel sick?

1014
01:06:45,097 --> 01:06:48,032
No. Maya, do you knock?

1015
01:06:48,533 --> 01:06:50,194
Well, I thought I did.

1016
01:06:50,302 --> 01:06:52,702
- I have the files you asked for.
- Great. Okay, thank you.

1017
01:06:52,804 --> 01:06:54,863
- I'll get those later. Thank you, Maya.
- Well, you just...

1018
01:06:54,973 --> 01:06:56,065
Thank you.

1019
01:06:59,411 --> 01:07:01,276
What is wrong with you?

1020
01:07:03,048 --> 01:07:06,279
I thought we agreed
that we would work after-hours.

1021
01:07:06,551 --> 01:07:09,042
Oh. Oh, I'm sorry.

1022
01:07:09,154 --> 01:07:10,951
You know,
you can't just come up to my office.

1023
01:07:11,056 --> 01:07:13,718
You know, it's a lot of nosey people and...

1024
01:07:13,825 --> 01:07:16,817
My bad. You know, I just
thought last night me and you...

1025
01:07:16,928 --> 01:07:20,489
- No, no, I hope you're not offended.
- No, I should have called you.

1026
01:07:22,901 --> 01:07:24,732
- You understand, right?
- Yeah.

1027
01:07:26,905 --> 01:07:29,567
- Great. Okay.
- All right, cool.

1028
01:07:29,674 --> 01:07:32,302
- Great.
- All right, so, yeah.

1029
01:07:32,410 --> 01:07:33,843
- Okay.
- You look good.

1030
01:07:33,945 --> 01:07:35,344
Thank you for that.

1031
01:07:40,085 --> 01:07:41,245
Damn it.

1032
01:08:01,806 --> 01:08:04,775
- So, your dad went to go get dinner?
- Yes.

1033
01:08:06,711 --> 01:08:08,736
Is it... Is it far?

1034
01:08:11,583 --> 01:08:12,709
Maybe.

1035
01:08:15,654 --> 01:08:19,715
- So, you have to be...
- Don't come up in here like you know us.

1036
01:08:20,492 --> 01:08:21,822
Oh, goodness.

1037
01:08:23,127 --> 01:08:26,460
I'm Lauryn and these are my sisters,
Sierra and China.

1038
01:08:28,132 --> 01:08:30,259
- Where did you meet my daddy at?
- We met at work.

1039
01:08:30,367 --> 01:08:34,428
I think you guys saw me in court
the other day. Remember?

1040
01:08:34,538 --> 01:08:37,632
- Oh, court? That was you?
- Yeah.

1041
01:08:37,741 --> 01:08:39,766
You look so much older.

1042
01:08:43,214 --> 01:08:46,650
- What did you say your name was again?
- Julia.

1043
01:08:47,451 --> 01:08:50,511
- Ain't that a white-girl name?
- Okay, now, we're supposed to be nice...

1044
01:08:50,621 --> 01:08:51,713
China.

1045
01:08:51,822 --> 01:08:54,552
...and say thank you for helping my daddy
try to get custody of us.

1046
01:08:54,658 --> 01:08:56,216
Oh, it's no problem, really.

1047
01:08:56,327 --> 01:08:58,659
Well, you could try a little harder.

1048
01:08:58,762 --> 01:09:01,196
I've been having migraines
since I've been living there.

1049
01:09:01,298 --> 01:09:02,765
- Migraines?
- Bad migraines.

1050
01:09:02,866 --> 01:09:04,697
- I'm sorry. I'm trying.
- Really bad migraines.

1051
01:09:04,802 --> 01:09:06,167
- Hey.
- Hey, you made it.

1052
01:09:06,270 --> 01:09:07,999
- Yeah.
- Hey, Daddy.

1053
01:09:10,674 --> 01:09:12,972
Yeah, your kids
are certainly gonna be lawyers

1054
01:09:13,110 --> 01:09:15,101
'cause they sure as heck
grilled the hell out of me.

1055
01:09:15,212 --> 01:09:17,009
I bet they did.

1056
01:09:17,114 --> 01:09:19,844
- Hi, girls. What you doing?
- Nothing.

1057
01:09:22,853 --> 01:09:26,084
And she's at school,
but she is not a nice girl at all.

1058
01:09:26,190 --> 01:09:27,521
- No?
- No.

1059
01:09:27,625 --> 01:09:30,025
- Are you a nice lady?
- I try to be.

1060
01:09:31,228 --> 01:09:33,753
I like your hair. Don't you, Sisi?

1061
01:09:35,165 --> 01:09:36,462
It's all right.

1062
01:09:36,934 --> 01:09:38,765
Looks like a weave to me.

1063
01:09:39,737 --> 01:09:41,136
- No, it's not.
- Sierra.

1064
01:09:41,238 --> 01:09:42,967
- What?
- So rude.

1065
01:09:43,073 --> 01:09:45,098
She's so rude. Are you okay, Daddy?

1066
01:09:45,209 --> 01:09:47,700
- I think it's time for y'all to go to bed.
- No, please.

1067
01:09:47,811 --> 01:09:50,075
- Not yet.
- Just five more minutes, not yet.

1068
01:09:50,180 --> 01:09:51,374
- Good night.
- No.

1069
01:09:51,482 --> 01:09:53,575
- Please, I want to talk to Ms. Julia.
- Say good night.

1070
01:09:53,684 --> 01:09:55,345
- Good night, Ms. Julia.
- Thank you.

1071
01:09:55,452 --> 01:09:57,079
Good night.

1072
01:09:57,187 --> 01:09:59,246
- Good night.
- Sierra.

1073
01:10:01,258 --> 01:10:02,282
Bye.

1074
01:10:03,694 --> 01:10:04,718
Bye.

1075
01:10:06,030 --> 01:10:07,554
Tell me what you know.

1076
01:10:07,665 --> 01:10:11,533
You know what?
I'll tell you what I do know.

1077
01:10:11,635 --> 01:10:16,504
I know that you, you're feeling me,
but you won't let yourself go there

1078
01:10:16,607 --> 01:10:20,236
because you care more about what
people think than your own happiness.

1079
01:10:20,344 --> 01:10:21,333
Am I right?

1080
01:10:21,445 --> 01:10:24,073
We could both act like, you know,
the other night never happened.

1081
01:10:24,181 --> 01:10:26,115
- But we both know it did.
- I was drunk.

1082
01:10:26,216 --> 01:10:27,649
- No, no.
- No, I was drunk.

1083
01:10:27,751 --> 01:10:31,744
You was being yourself and like my
mama used to say, God rest her soul,

1084
01:10:31,855 --> 01:10:34,153
"A drunk man never tells no tales."

1085
01:10:35,659 --> 01:10:36,717
What?

1086
01:10:38,162 --> 01:10:39,459
- Touch.
- Yeah.

1087
01:10:41,265 --> 01:10:43,859
- So your mom passed?
- Yeah.

1088
01:10:44,768 --> 01:10:47,464
- My mom passed.
- I'm sorry to hear that.

1089
01:10:50,407 --> 01:10:52,170
- What about your dad?
- Who?

1090
01:10:52,276 --> 01:10:55,541
- Your dad?
- My dad, I don't know my dad.

1091
01:10:55,646 --> 01:10:59,480
I got a whole bunch of brothers and
sisters that I don't know, but that's cool.

1092
01:11:01,285 --> 01:11:03,651
It's funny how life works out.

1093
01:11:03,754 --> 01:11:07,815
You never knew your dad,
but my dad would have killed for a boy.

1094
01:11:07,925 --> 01:11:09,256
- For a boy?
- For a boy.

1095
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:11,453
- Didn't get one.
- I know the feeling.

1096
01:11:12,463 --> 01:11:15,023
That man pushed me so hard, God.

1097
01:11:18,135 --> 01:11:21,627
I made partner in the firm before I was 28.

1098
01:11:21,739 --> 01:11:24,173
My parents have retired to South Beach.

1099
01:11:26,343 --> 01:11:28,208
I don't know, Ms. Julia. You know what?

1100
01:11:28,312 --> 01:11:31,611
You and I,
we come from two different worlds but...

1101
01:11:32,282 --> 01:11:34,512
Well, there is something
going on here, right?

1102
01:11:42,259 --> 01:11:43,692
- You want me to stop?
- No.

1103
01:11:43,794 --> 01:11:45,056
- No?
- No.

1104
01:11:52,169 --> 01:11:56,265
- Oh, you're on time today.
- Well, he's on time all right.

1105
01:11:56,373 --> 01:11:57,704
Oh, my God!

1106
01:12:00,411 --> 01:12:04,643
- What happened to you?
- Some thugs tried to break in here.

1107
01:12:05,616 --> 01:12:08,949
I fought them out.
Before that happened one of them cut me.

1108
01:12:09,052 --> 01:12:10,713
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm all right.

1109
01:12:10,821 --> 01:12:12,220
Did you catch them?

1110
01:12:12,322 --> 01:12:16,088
No, it was just some crackhead
trying to get some stuff.

1111
01:12:17,461 --> 01:12:21,227
Yeah, I'm getting too old for this, man.
I'm tired of it.

1112
01:12:21,331 --> 01:12:22,593
They win!

1113
01:12:24,501 --> 01:12:26,628
You know, I was thinking.

1114
01:12:28,972 --> 01:12:32,931
I gotta get rid of this place.
I gotta leave this neighborhood.

1115
01:12:33,977 --> 01:12:37,640
So if you can get together what you can
for a down payment,

1116
01:12:37,748 --> 01:12:41,275
and then you hit me up once a month

1117
01:12:41,385 --> 01:12:43,785
until we reach 10, plus interest

1118
01:12:45,355 --> 01:12:48,256
you can have this place.
Would you do that?

1119
01:12:48,358 --> 01:12:51,759
I mean, sure. What are you saying?
Are you serious, man?

1120
01:12:51,862 --> 01:12:55,491
Yeah, this place is officially yours.

1121
01:12:57,334 --> 01:13:00,269
- I mean, I didn't want it like this.
- Me, neither.

1122
01:13:03,407 --> 01:13:07,503
But you gotta let me come back
and help you from time to time.

1123
01:13:07,611 --> 01:13:09,636
Any time you're ready, man.

1124
01:13:11,949 --> 01:13:13,177
All right.

1125
01:13:13,283 --> 01:13:14,772
Oh, man.

1126
01:13:23,059 --> 01:13:24,686
Congratulations.

1127
01:13:27,029 --> 01:13:30,430
- Is he gonna be all right?
- He'll be fine.

1128
01:13:34,437 --> 01:13:35,870
You see that?

1129
01:13:39,809 --> 01:13:41,174
I see it. Oh, look at that.

1130
01:13:41,277 --> 01:13:44,576
- Can you see it, Ms. Julia?
- I do. Wow.

1131
01:13:46,682 --> 01:13:49,651
So, you know, I'm mad excited.

1132
01:13:50,219 --> 01:13:52,153
I'm gonna get my sign for my new garage.

1133
01:13:52,255 --> 01:13:53,483
- I know.
- I know.

1134
01:13:53,589 --> 01:13:56,888
- Sounds great.
- I know. I'm really excited about that.

1135
01:13:57,927 --> 01:13:59,258
Congratulations.

1136
01:14:00,563 --> 01:14:02,622
- Julia?
- Hey.

1137
01:14:02,732 --> 01:14:05,064
Hey. What are you doing here?

1138
01:14:06,669 --> 01:14:09,103
- Nothing, we were just...
- I'm Monty.

1139
01:14:09,906 --> 01:14:12,500
- I remember you.
- Okay.

1140
01:14:12,608 --> 01:14:16,339
- Can I talk to you for a sec?
- Yeah.

1141
01:14:17,813 --> 01:14:20,907
- What are you doing with this man?
- What? We're just hanging out.

1142
01:14:21,017 --> 01:14:23,884
Are you serious? You like him?

1143
01:14:23,986 --> 01:14:27,717
- He's a nice guy.
- Snap out of it, Julia.

1144
01:14:27,823 --> 01:14:31,088
You are a partner at your firm,
the only black woman at that level.

1145
01:14:31,193 --> 01:14:33,286
What do you think your partners
would think if they knew

1146
01:14:33,396 --> 01:14:35,796
you were sleeping around with the help?

1147
01:14:35,898 --> 01:14:38,264
Are you trying to ruin your life?

1148
01:14:39,702 --> 01:14:41,727
- Hey, Julia, how you doing?
- Good, how you doing?

1149
01:14:41,837 --> 01:14:43,964
- Hey, baby, you ready?
- Yeah.

1150
01:14:52,882 --> 01:14:54,372
Come on, guys.

1151
01:15:07,663 --> 01:15:12,327
I think there'll be some people
who are disappointed in me behind this.

1152
01:15:15,805 --> 01:15:18,865
I mean, you know who I am.
I'm from the streets.

1153
01:15:20,009 --> 01:15:22,705
- I can't change that.
- I'm not trying to change you.

1154
01:15:22,812 --> 01:15:24,575
- Do I embarrass you?
- No!

1155
01:15:24,680 --> 01:15:27,513
I mean, it's obvious that I do.
And that's okay. That's okay.

1156
01:15:27,617 --> 01:15:29,778
You just gotta tell me that.

1157
01:15:31,187 --> 01:15:33,678
Tell me the truth,
so that way I know how to deal with it.

1158
01:15:33,789 --> 01:15:36,758
Look, I don't know how I feel. Okay?

1159
01:15:36,859 --> 01:15:38,486
But I can't sit here and lie to you,

1160
01:15:38,594 --> 01:15:42,587
and say that I don't think about
who you are and what you have.

1161
01:15:42,698 --> 01:15:43,995
I do.

1162
01:15:44,100 --> 01:15:46,227
You have three daughters,

1163
01:15:46,335 --> 01:15:48,701
one of whom is almost as big as I am.

1164
01:15:50,106 --> 01:15:54,270
This is new for me, Monty,
and it's different, and I'm trying.

1165
01:15:54,877 --> 01:15:58,040
I am trying
and you gotta give me credit for that.

1166
01:16:02,785 --> 01:16:05,652
Can we finish this conversation? Come on.

1167
01:16:06,255 --> 01:16:09,156
- No.
- No? What are you... What...

1168
01:16:09,258 --> 01:16:11,123
I got my girls for like two more hours,

1169
01:16:11,227 --> 01:16:13,661
and I'm not gonna waste my time
dealing with this.

1170
01:16:13,763 --> 01:16:15,958
But I will tell you something.

1171
01:16:17,733 --> 01:16:20,065
You don't have three girls in your life.

1172
01:16:20,169 --> 01:16:22,535
- It's just you.
- Monty. Monty.

1173
01:16:23,139 --> 01:16:25,198
- Monty.
- Big guy, ain't he?

1174
01:16:25,741 --> 01:16:27,470
- He's so pretty.
- Pretty?

1175
01:16:31,080 --> 01:16:34,379
- Look at that one.
- That one's bigger than all of them.

1176
01:16:35,317 --> 01:16:36,579
Yeah.

1177
01:16:49,932 --> 01:16:52,992
I told him,
"Do not bring this chick to my house."

1178
01:16:58,974 --> 01:17:01,602
- Watch the seatbelt. Come on.
- I love you, Daddy.

1179
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:07,110
- See you later.
- Come on, y'all. Hurry up.

1180
01:17:07,216 --> 01:17:09,946
- Bye, Ms. Julia.
- All right.

1181
01:17:14,356 --> 01:17:18,452
I love y'all. Okay? Y'all be good, okay?

1182
01:17:18,561 --> 01:17:21,223
- Little butterfly. Go ahead.
- Come on, y'all.

1183
01:17:27,002 --> 01:17:28,128
Come on, y'all. Hurry up.

1184
01:17:28,237 --> 01:17:30,865
Shoot, I've been standing out here
all night. I'm tired, too.

1185
01:17:30,973 --> 01:17:33,567
Y'all think y'all the only ones tired? Shoot.

1186
01:17:40,082 --> 01:17:43,574
Just let me explain, Monty.

1187
01:17:48,724 --> 01:17:53,184
The last man that I loved,
he hurt me to my soul.

1188
01:17:55,064 --> 01:17:57,123
We were together six years,

1189
01:17:59,135 --> 01:18:02,400
and he told me it was over
two days before his wedding.

1190
01:18:03,506 --> 01:18:06,474
I trusted him with everything.

1191
01:18:07,742 --> 01:18:13,442
And I've never felt so low
and stupid and humiliated in my life.

1192
01:18:14,182 --> 01:18:18,812
And so I told myself
not to think about you.

1193
01:18:20,789 --> 01:18:23,485
But I couldn't 'cause I do all the time.

1194
01:18:26,094 --> 01:18:27,721
So what are you saying?

1195
01:18:27,829 --> 01:18:31,492
I'm saying that I've been running
from something that already happened.

1196
01:18:31,599 --> 01:18:34,659
And I'm saying that
I fell in love with you, Monty James.

1197
01:18:34,769 --> 01:18:37,260
And I'm saying
that I hope I'm not in this alone.

1198
01:18:37,372 --> 01:18:38,703
You're not.

1199
01:18:39,340 --> 01:18:40,967
You're not alone.

1200
01:18:45,146 --> 01:18:46,443
Come here.

1201
01:18:55,490 --> 01:18:57,014
Your Honor,
the children's own grandmother,

1202
01:18:57,125 --> 01:19:00,322
their maternal grandmother at that,
went down to Child Welfare

1203
01:19:00,428 --> 01:19:01,725
and prepared a written statement

1204
01:19:01,830 --> 01:19:03,991
as to why the children
should be placed with their father.

1205
01:19:04,098 --> 01:19:05,963
Let me see that.

1206
01:19:06,067 --> 01:19:08,433
- Did you know about this?
- Look, I don't know nothing about this.

1207
01:19:08,536 --> 01:19:10,231
I don't know
what they're trying to pull now.

1208
01:19:10,338 --> 01:19:13,307
Your Honor, my client has the means
to take care of these girls.

1209
01:19:13,408 --> 01:19:14,636
And she wants to take care...

1210
01:19:14,742 --> 01:19:17,609
It says here that her mother thought
the means were ill-gotten.

1211
01:19:17,712 --> 01:19:20,681
- Well, that's pure...
- What do you do for a living, Ms. Jackson?

1212
01:19:20,782 --> 01:19:24,513
Well, I don't work, Your Honor,
but my boyfriend does.

1213
01:19:24,619 --> 01:19:25,813
What does he do?

1214
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:28,411
You know, I mean,
he owns his own businesses.

1215
01:19:28,523 --> 01:19:30,423
And where are the tax returns?

1216
01:19:30,525 --> 01:19:32,220
Well, you know,
we was working on getting them.

1217
01:19:32,327 --> 01:19:34,818
And you know what, Your Honor,
you keep asking me about my stuff,

1218
01:19:34,929 --> 01:19:37,159
you need to be asking Monty
about some of his secrets

1219
01:19:37,265 --> 01:19:38,527
'cause he got a whole lot of them.

1220
01:19:38,633 --> 01:19:40,260
What is she talking about?

1221
01:19:40,368 --> 01:19:45,931
Your Honor, Mr. James was convicted of the
rape of a 16-year-old girl 16 years ago.

1222
01:19:46,040 --> 01:19:48,372
And we're afraid
for the safety of the children.

1223
01:19:48,476 --> 01:19:51,309
Counselor,
what do you have to say about this?

1224
01:19:53,248 --> 01:19:55,239
I wasn't aware, Your Honor.

1225
01:19:55,350 --> 01:19:58,581
It's right here in black and white.
Yeah, he was sentenced to eight years.

1226
01:19:58,686 --> 01:20:01,621
He's been on probation
ever since his release.

1227
01:20:01,723 --> 01:20:03,588
I'll take this matter under advisement.

1228
01:20:03,691 --> 01:20:06,421
I need to review
the circumstances of this case.

1229
01:20:06,527 --> 01:20:07,824
Adjourned.

1230
01:20:11,532 --> 01:20:15,935
So how long has he been screwing you?
Huh? 'Cause I know he can't afford you.

1231
01:20:16,604 --> 01:20:18,731
- Move, move.
- Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1232
01:20:18,840 --> 01:20:20,569
I'll have to tap that ass.

1233
01:20:20,675 --> 01:20:22,472
Let me explain. Let me explain something.

1234
01:20:22,577 --> 01:20:23,805
- Get away from me.
- Hold on.

1235
01:20:23,912 --> 01:20:25,311
- Let me...
- Get you hands off of me.

1236
01:20:25,413 --> 01:20:26,903
- Wait, let me explain.
- You know what, shut up.

1237
01:20:27,015 --> 01:20:29,984
Shut the hell up. I can't even
stand to look at you, right now.

1238
01:20:30,084 --> 01:20:33,178
I asked you if there were any surprises.
You said no.

1239
01:20:33,288 --> 01:20:34,346
You're a rapist.

1240
01:20:34,455 --> 01:20:36,480
You don't think that's something
that I should have known about?

1241
01:20:36,591 --> 01:20:38,422
- Let me explain.
- Don't you touch me.

1242
01:20:38,559 --> 01:20:40,527
Julia, look. Look. Look.

1243
01:20:40,628 --> 01:20:43,791
Let me ask you a question. Did you
or did you not go to jail for rape?

1244
01:20:43,898 --> 01:20:46,025
- Julia, look. Julia, look.
- Did you go to jail?

1245
01:20:46,134 --> 01:20:48,068
- Did you go to jail for rape, Monty?
- Yes.

1246
01:20:48,202 --> 01:20:49,260
That's all I need to know.

1247
01:20:49,370 --> 01:20:52,168
Do you know what, it doesn't even matter
'cause you're a liar, Monty.

1248
01:20:52,273 --> 01:20:55,800
You're a filthy... God, you're a filthy liar.

1249
01:20:55,910 --> 01:21:00,609
This case is over. Maya will call you and
tell you when to return for the ruling.

1250
01:21:00,715 --> 01:21:04,617
You don't need me anymore, Monty,
and I certainly don't need you.

1251
01:21:14,629 --> 01:21:16,688
So, you like him that much?

1252
01:21:17,799 --> 01:21:20,233
- I fell in love with him.
- Oh, Julia.

1253
01:21:21,369 --> 01:21:25,271
Sweetie, this was supposed to be
a fun thing, not a love thing.

1254
01:21:25,807 --> 01:21:26,967
I know.

1255
01:21:28,343 --> 01:21:30,208
Go ahead, Bren, tell me, "I told you so."

1256
01:21:30,311 --> 01:21:33,678
Oh, girl, you know I'm not gonna do that.

1257
01:21:33,781 --> 01:21:36,511
It's just good that you found out now.

1258
01:21:36,617 --> 01:21:38,482
I'm with Brenda on this.

1259
01:21:39,320 --> 01:21:42,414
Julia, this guy was probably
just after your money.

1260
01:21:42,523 --> 01:21:44,718
He wasn't even like that.

1261
01:21:44,826 --> 01:21:49,889
You know, you guys, he was a hard worker.
And he treated...

1262
01:21:49,998 --> 01:21:52,899
God, he treats those girls
like they are princesses.

1263
01:21:53,001 --> 01:21:55,629
Well, let's not forget he has a record.

1264
01:21:57,205 --> 01:21:59,264
How did I not know he was lying?

1265
01:21:59,374 --> 01:22:03,367
Because he's probably really good at it.
They all are.

1266
01:22:05,847 --> 01:22:11,513
It's like I'm hearing it, you guys,
and I'm trying to understand, but I just...

1267
01:22:11,619 --> 01:22:13,780
It doesn't make sense.

1268
01:22:15,156 --> 01:22:16,418
You know?

1269
01:22:17,558 --> 01:22:21,187
And I can't make my brain believe
that it was all a lie.

1270
01:22:26,567 --> 01:22:28,558
Is it as bad as it sounds?

1271
01:22:30,138 --> 01:22:33,630
Honey, it's as bad as it sounds.

1272
01:22:35,309 --> 01:22:39,040
Jules, just do yourself a favor.

1273
01:22:39,147 --> 01:22:41,479
Forget about this guy.

1274
01:22:41,582 --> 01:22:44,176
He just sounds like a lot of trouble.

1275
01:22:46,788 --> 01:22:47,846
Okay?

1276
01:23:14,147 --> 01:23:15,842
I just want to say...

1277
01:23:34,501 --> 01:23:35,866
It was like that.

1278
01:23:37,571 --> 01:23:40,199
<i>Hi, this is Julia. Leave a message.</i>

1279
01:23:48,682 --> 01:23:50,047
Who that?

1280
01:24:03,063 --> 01:24:04,928
What y'all doing here?

1281
01:24:05,932 --> 01:24:07,524
What y'all doing here?

1282
01:24:08,869 --> 01:24:10,530
Where your mama at?

1283
01:24:11,571 --> 01:24:13,937
What happened, Sisi? What happened?

1284
01:24:15,542 --> 01:24:18,602
Daddy, we don't really care
what the judge says.

1285
01:24:19,579 --> 01:24:21,672
We just want to be with you.

1286
01:24:21,815 --> 01:24:23,248
I'm staying here.

1287
01:24:25,519 --> 01:24:27,510
- How did y'all get here?
- We walked.

1288
01:24:27,621 --> 01:24:29,521
Y'all walked at 3:00 in the morning?

1289
01:24:29,623 --> 01:24:32,353
We can't stay there anymore, Daddy.
I'm sorry.

1290
01:24:32,459 --> 01:24:34,586
- What you talking about?
- Daddy.

1291
01:24:34,694 --> 01:24:36,992
- What happened?
- Joe...

1292
01:24:37,797 --> 01:24:41,824
Joe what? Sisi you can talk to me.
You tell me, what happened?

1293
01:24:43,003 --> 01:24:45,062
- Joe keeps...
- He keeps what?

1294
01:24:45,839 --> 01:24:47,830
Joe keeps hitting China.

1295
01:24:47,941 --> 01:24:49,033
What?

1296
01:24:50,911 --> 01:24:52,469
- Where? Come here. Where?
- On my back.

1297
01:24:52,579 --> 01:24:54,046
On your back?

1298
01:24:55,148 --> 01:24:58,447
Mama was sitting right there.
She didn't even say anything.

1299
01:25:02,722 --> 01:25:06,522
Hold on. Hold on a second.
Come here. He hit you?

1300
01:25:06,626 --> 01:25:09,356
He hit me because I wouldn't stop crying.

1301
01:25:09,462 --> 01:25:12,226
- Daddy, I was so sad.
- Okay.

1302
01:25:12,332 --> 01:25:14,698
Okay, come here. Come here.

1303
01:25:18,171 --> 01:25:20,935
Grandma told me.
Grandma told me to look after y'all.

1304
01:25:21,041 --> 01:25:23,635
I got to look after y'all.

1305
01:25:23,743 --> 01:25:26,007
So y'all gonna stay with me now.

1306
01:25:30,417 --> 01:25:32,817
Y'all gonna stay with me now. Okay?

1307
01:25:32,919 --> 01:25:34,284
Okay?

1308
01:25:34,387 --> 01:25:37,686
Sisi, I'm so sorry. I am so sorry.

1309
01:25:42,429 --> 01:25:46,024
Okay, you gotta stay with me.
It's gonna be all right.

1310
01:25:51,271 --> 01:25:52,602
It's gonna be all right.

1311
01:27:20,427 --> 01:27:22,327
Wait, hold up.

1312
01:27:22,429 --> 01:27:25,865
Monty, Monty. Man, come on.

1313
01:27:25,965 --> 01:27:27,865
<i>Some girls up in here, man.</i>

1314
01:27:27,967 --> 01:27:30,595
Monty, what are you doing, man?

1315
01:27:30,704 --> 01:27:33,104
Come on. What's taking you so long?

1316
01:27:33,206 --> 01:27:35,436
- I'm Monty.
- We know who you are.

1317
01:27:35,542 --> 01:27:36,770
You beat our team.

1318
01:27:36,876 --> 01:27:38,036
- How old are you?
- Eighteen.

1319
01:27:38,144 --> 01:27:39,839
You know, this sure is a nice place
you have here.

1320
01:27:39,946 --> 01:27:41,208
You want to see my room?

1321
01:27:41,314 --> 01:27:42,906
- So you gonna call me?
- Probably not.

1322
01:27:43,016 --> 01:27:45,246
You're just like all the other guys.

1323
01:27:45,352 --> 01:27:47,081
Mandy, what are you doing?
Did he force you?

1324
01:27:47,187 --> 01:27:48,882
- No way. Tell him.
- Mandy.

1325
01:27:50,322 --> 01:27:51,550
- Yes, Daddy.
- What?

1326
01:27:51,657 --> 01:27:53,215
- Sir, I didn't do anything.
- Shut up.

1327
01:27:53,325 --> 01:27:55,953
- I didn't do anything. It was her idea.
- Shut up, superstar.

1328
01:27:56,061 --> 01:27:57,824
- Tell him, I didn't do anything.
- Call the police.

1329
01:27:57,930 --> 01:28:00,330
Tell him, Amanda.
If you don't tell the truth, I'm going to jail.

1330
01:28:00,432 --> 01:28:02,195
- Tell him the truth.
- You're ball days are over.

1331
01:28:02,301 --> 01:28:03,791
- You got me?
- I didn't do nothing.

1332
01:28:03,902 --> 01:28:05,870
<i>- Shut up!
- I didn't do nothing.</i>

1333
01:28:05,971 --> 01:28:07,302
<i>- Shut up!
- I didn't do...</i>

1334
01:28:07,406 --> 01:28:09,704
<i>Get you hands off of me.
I can't even stand to look at you.</i>

1335
01:28:09,808 --> 01:28:11,537
<i>You're a rapist.</i>

1336
01:28:34,466 --> 01:28:36,730
I bet you
he won't ever take our money again.

1337
01:28:36,835 --> 01:28:40,703
I know, that's right.
Got to keep it straight, Jen.

1338
01:28:40,806 --> 01:28:43,001
You know I got your back, right, baby?

1339
01:28:43,108 --> 01:28:45,303
That's why you my girl.

1340
01:28:45,411 --> 01:28:48,380
You know, I want to go see that movie
with the dude with the ax.

1341
01:28:48,480 --> 01:28:50,072
No, no, no, it's the chain saw.

1342
01:28:50,182 --> 01:28:52,673
Baby, you know
if we went to see that movie...

1343
01:29:05,130 --> 01:29:06,597
Check it out.

1344
01:29:07,099 --> 01:29:09,397
Oh, snap. Load up. Load up.

1345
01:30:14,099 --> 01:30:15,293
Stop it!

1346
01:30:44,997 --> 01:30:47,192
<i>There was a near riot today
in the Edgewood community.</i>

1347
01:30:47,299 --> 01:30:49,859
<i>Police officers were called in
to break up a fight</i>

1348
01:30:49,968 --> 01:30:53,665
<i>between local gang members
and residents who had had enough.</i>

1349
01:30:53,772 --> 01:30:56,400
<i>Among those arrested was Monty James.</i>

1350
01:30:56,508 --> 01:30:59,534
<i>You may remember Monty James,
a high school basketball star,</i>

1351
01:30:59,645 --> 01:31:02,409
<i>who was falsely convicted in 1990</i>

1352
01:31:02,514 --> 01:31:06,507
<i>for allegedly having non-consensual sex
with a 17-year-old girl.</i>

1353
01:31:07,219 --> 01:31:09,813
I'm assuming you have
admissible evidence this time.

1354
01:31:09,922 --> 01:31:11,048
Yes, Your Honor.

1355
01:31:11,156 --> 01:31:13,716
The police seized
several pounds of marijuana,

1356
01:31:13,825 --> 01:31:15,417
hidden in the defendant's vehicle.

1357
01:31:15,527 --> 01:31:16,824
Subsequent search of the residence

1358
01:31:16,929 --> 01:31:19,830
turned up several kilograms
of crack cocaine.

1359
01:31:19,932 --> 01:31:21,763
This time, Your Honor,
we have a valid warrant.

1360
01:31:21,867 --> 01:31:24,927
Your Honor, even though
they served a search warrant,

1361
01:31:25,037 --> 01:31:27,198
they still have no witnesses.

1362
01:31:31,143 --> 01:31:33,839
Your Honor, I'll testify.

1363
01:31:57,069 --> 01:32:00,561
Congratulations,
it looks like you have a case.

1364
01:32:00,672 --> 01:32:04,665
Take them into custody.
There will be no bond.

1365
01:32:04,776 --> 01:32:06,505
- Next case.
- Wait, get your hands off of me.

1366
01:32:06,612 --> 01:32:09,479
The State of Georgia versus Monty James.

1367
01:32:12,384 --> 01:32:17,447
Order. Order in this court! All of
you, quiet, or I'll have you removed.

1368
01:32:17,823 --> 01:32:19,882
I will have order.

1369
01:32:22,227 --> 01:32:23,751
Order.

1370
01:32:23,862 --> 01:32:25,352
Order.

1371
01:32:25,464 --> 01:32:27,159
I said order!

1372
01:32:28,400 --> 01:32:31,426
- Who's here for the defense?
- I am, Your Honor.

1373
01:32:32,371 --> 01:32:33,998
Ms. Rossmore.

1374
01:32:34,106 --> 01:32:36,506
May I take a second, please?

1375
01:32:36,608 --> 01:32:38,303
What you doing here?

1376
01:32:38,410 --> 01:32:40,708
I'm sorry, I didn't give
you a chance to explain,

1377
01:32:40,812 --> 01:32:44,577
and if you don't ever want to speak
to me again, I completely understand.

1378
01:32:44,682 --> 01:32:46,240
Let me help you.

1379
01:32:47,251 --> 01:32:48,684
Monty, just let me help you.

1380
01:32:48,786 --> 01:32:50,777
Just get me back to my kids.

1381
01:32:52,423 --> 01:32:53,981
Ms. Rossmore?

1382
01:32:55,826 --> 01:32:59,057
Your Honor, there's no evidence
my client committed any criminal act.

1383
01:32:59,163 --> 01:33:01,028
The State has no case against him.

1384
01:33:01,132 --> 01:33:02,463
We demand a preliminary hearing

1385
01:33:02,566 --> 01:33:04,500
and request the State be required
to show probable cause.

1386
01:33:04,602 --> 01:33:07,571
Your Honor, I'm sure that one of these
witnesses can attest to the fact

1387
01:33:07,672 --> 01:33:11,005
that Mr. James drove his vehicle
into the previous defendant's vehicle.

1388
01:33:11,108 --> 01:33:12,507
It was an accident.

1389
01:33:12,610 --> 01:33:15,704
I'm sure that the subsequent fistfight
was an accident also there, Counselor.

1390
01:33:15,813 --> 01:33:17,007
Where are the witnesses?

1391
01:33:17,114 --> 01:33:19,014
Your Honor,
the entire neighborhood saw this.

1392
01:33:19,116 --> 01:33:20,310
I'm sure we have a witness.

1393
01:33:20,418 --> 01:33:23,819
May I have one of the witnesses
please stand at this time?

1394
01:33:36,033 --> 01:33:38,365
- Your Honor...
- I'm dismissing the case.

1395
01:33:54,618 --> 01:33:55,949
I love you,

1396
01:33:58,289 --> 01:34:00,450
and I'm sorry for everything.

1397
01:34:28,352 --> 01:34:31,947
Oh, man. Come on, man.
I can't believe this.

1398
01:34:33,190 --> 01:34:35,215
The whole neighborhood remembered.

1399
01:34:35,326 --> 01:34:36,520
- Daddy!
- Daddy!

1400
01:34:57,581 --> 01:34:59,071
Come here, baby.

1401
01:35:04,722 --> 01:35:08,180
- It's all on you now, boy.
- I love you, man. I appreciate it.

1402
01:35:08,292 --> 01:35:09,554
Bye, babies.

1403
01:35:10,554 --> 01:35:20,554
