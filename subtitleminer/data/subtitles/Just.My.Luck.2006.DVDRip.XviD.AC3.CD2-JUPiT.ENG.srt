It's okay.

2
00:00:10,669 --> 00:00:12,569
Oh—

3
00:00:14,139 --> 00:00:16,369
Did you just put that
back in your eye?

4
00:00:16,475 --> 00:00:20,036
- It was my last one, guys.
- That's really gross.

5
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:21,373
Ow! My eye!

6
00:00:26,885 --> 00:00:29,183
But, you see,
l— I'm on the list. I'm "plus one."

7
00:00:29,288 --> 00:00:30,755
David Pennington, plus one.

8
00:00:34,493 --> 00:00:37,394
- Hi, David.
- There he is. See? There he is.

9
00:00:38,864 --> 00:00:41,594
- Oh, hey.
- David Pennington. There.

10
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,430
No, no, no. There.
She's— She's with me.

11
00:00:44,536 --> 00:00:46,970
Thank you. Oh!

12
00:00:47,072 --> 00:00:49,131
Ooh.

13
00:00:49,241 --> 00:00:52,039
I'm okay. Fine.

14
00:00:52,144 --> 00:00:55,079
Come on.
I got a surprise for you.

15
00:00:58,917 --> 00:01:00,908
Oh, my God.

16
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:03,988
<i>Would you look at that big, ugly...</i>

17
00:01:04,089 --> 00:01:05,989
- brown pile of—
- Uh, Ashley—

18
00:01:06,091 --> 00:01:09,458
It looked like it came out of the rear end
of an elephant.

19
00:01:09,561 --> 00:01:11,756
- Ashley.
- Huh?

20
00:01:11,864 --> 00:01:15,061
Uh—
Meet my mother, the artist.

21
00:01:15,167 --> 00:01:17,727
- Hmm.
- The artist.

22
00:01:17,836 --> 00:01:20,669
Hi, Mrs. Pennington.

23
00:01:20,773 --> 00:01:23,765
You know, you look
so much younger in person.

24
00:01:23,876 --> 00:01:26,606
Not that I mean
you're old or anything.

25
00:01:26,712 --> 00:01:29,840
David, if I'm going to listen to this,
I'll need vodka.

26
00:01:29,948 --> 00:01:31,848
Good idea.

27
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:33,508
<i>- Waiter.</i>
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>

28
00:01:37,122 --> 00:01:39,613
Sure. Hmm?

29
00:01:39,725 --> 00:01:41,522
No, thank you.

30
00:01:41,627 --> 00:01:46,087
David, darling, that awful man
from the <i>Times</i> is here.

31
00:01:46,198 --> 00:01:48,996
It's him.

32
00:01:49,101 --> 00:01:50,591
- That son of a—
- Excuse me.

33
00:01:50,702 --> 00:01:54,001
Yeah? Oh, um, the waiter.
He was just—

34
00:01:54,106 --> 00:01:57,041
- More your type? I totally agree.
- Wha—

35
00:01:57,142 --> 00:02:01,670
- Mother, please.
- Um, if you two don't mind,
I'm gonna run to the ladies' room.

36
00:02:05,918 --> 00:02:08,478
You! Finally.

37
00:02:08,587 --> 00:02:11,647
- Excuse me?
- You're gonna keep your tongue
in your mouth at all times...

38
00:02:11,757 --> 00:02:14,351
- 'cause this is strictly business.
- What?

39
00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:16,518
- Give me back my luck. Come here.
- What the—

40
00:02:16,628 --> 00:02:18,391
- Let go of me.
- Just— Uh-oh.

41

<i> From the bowels of this</i>

- Let me up! I'm in the show!

43
00:02:27,472 --> 00:02:30,964
<i>- I am a mud man.</i>
<i>- I am a mud woman.</i>

<i>He's not breathing!</i>

48
00:02:45,457 --> 00:02:47,322
He's totally breathing!

49
00:02:47,426 --> 00:02:49,917
No, he's not.
It's a cardiac reflex thing.

50
00:02:50,028 --> 00:02:53,828
- I need to give him mouth-to-mouth.
- I can't breathe.

51
00:02:58,871 --> 00:03:00,600
Mmm.

52
00:03:00,706 --> 00:03:03,573
He's gonna be okay.

53
00:03:13,385 --> 00:03:16,149
- Sorry.
- Lucky you were here.

54
00:03:16,255 --> 00:03:18,280
Lucky you know C.P.R.

55
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:20,688
Yeah. You know what?
That's me. Lucky.

56
00:03:20,792 --> 00:03:22,692
You know, I'm feeling
kind of— Oh!

57
00:03:26,698 --> 00:03:28,928
<i>Oh.</i>

58
00:03:29,034 --> 00:03:30,934
<i>Irreplaceable!</i>

59
00:03:31,036 --> 00:03:32,628
<i>It's ruined.</i>

60
00:03:36,141 --> 00:03:38,974
This is ridiculous. It was just mud.

61
00:03:45,984 --> 00:03:49,283
You must have met my twin sister.
She was in here the other night.

62

<i>She's the bitch.</i>
<i>I'm the nice one.</i>

- What can I get you?
- Um, can I just have a glass of water?

64
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:31,427
No buy, no sit. See?

65
00:04:34,366 --> 00:04:36,891
Can I use the bathroom?

66
00:04:37,002 --> 00:04:39,596
N- No buy, no bathroom!

67
00:04:40,973 --> 00:04:43,237
Okay. Great. Fine. Fine.
I'm leaving.

68
00:04:43,342 --> 00:04:46,641
I'm leaving. Oh, are you all
enjoying the show?

69
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:49,077
You know, the real me
doesn't have days like this.

70
00:04:49,181 --> 00:04:51,672
As a matter of fact,
maybe I'm not even here right now.

71
00:04:51,783 --> 00:04:54,650
<i>This is all probably</i>
<i>a</i>—<i>a dream that I'm having...</i>

72
00:04:54,753 --> 00:04:57,051
induced by a—
a deep-tissue massage.

73
00:04:57,155 --> 00:05:00,989
<i>- Yes. A massage that I won at a charity raffle.</i>
<i>- Shut up.</i>

74
00:05:01,093 --> 00:05:02,890
<i>That looks good.</i>
<i>Are you done with that?</i>

75
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:06,856
No. That was a joke.
I'm not gonna eat your scraps.

76
00:05:06,965 --> 00:05:09,399
Gosh! Maybe just some bacon.

77
00:05:10,836 --> 00:05:14,294
Mmm! Mmm!

78
00:05:14,406 --> 00:05:16,499
I don't know what she's doing.

79
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:18,838
Mmm! Mmm!

80
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:22,913
Oh, my God.
I'm like a coyote.

81
00:05:27,586 --> 00:05:29,213
Perfect.

82
00:05:29,321 --> 00:05:31,516
Oh, not the salt.

83
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:34,057
Just so everyone knows...

84
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:38,186
<i>I think what I'm about to do is completely</i>
<i>ridiculous, but it can't hurt, can it?</i>

85
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:40,196
<i>Come on.</i>

86
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:42,425
- My eye!
- Oh, my God!

87
00:05:42,534 --> 00:05:45,094
Oh! Oh, my—

88
00:05:45,203 --> 00:05:48,331
- It was an accident. I'm sorry.
- Miss, I think it's, uh...

89
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,374
<i>- time to go now.</i>
- Oh, my God. All right.

90
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:53,239
I'm sorry.
It was an accident.

91
00:05:55,347 --> 00:05:59,147
<i>- I think we're clear.</i>
<i>- Thanks for that. Sorry.</i>

92
00:05:59,251 --> 00:06:02,243
- I couldn't help but overhear your, uh—
- Oh, meltdown?

93
00:06:02,354 --> 00:06:06,051
- Yeah. Broke. Jobless.
And I just ate <i>lejambon d'étranger.</i>

94
00:06:06,158 --> 00:06:08,956
- What?
- A stranger's bacon. I thought
it would sound better in French.

95
00:06:09,061 --> 00:06:11,552
- Oh.
- Guess not.

96
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:15,224
You looked a little hungry. I thought you
could use this. Turkey on rye, extra mustard.

97
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,893
Oh. Yes. Thank you.

98
00:06:18,003 --> 00:06:21,871
- Thanks. Um, nice to meet you.
- Okay. Yeah.

99
00:06:21,973 --> 00:06:23,941
I'm gonna—

100
00:06:30,549 --> 00:06:33,279
Look. I know of a job—
if you're looking for one.

101
00:06:33,385 --> 00:06:35,319
Really? What's the scam?

102
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:38,480
- No scam.
- Well, do you want me to
join your religion or something?

103
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:41,787
No. No religion stuff.

104
00:06:41,893 --> 00:06:45,090
It's just a job. You know, a bad job.
Crummy pay for crummy hours.

105
00:06:45,197 --> 00:06:47,631
That still doesn't answer
my question. What's the scam?

106
00:06:47,732 --> 00:06:50,826
Let's just say I know
what it's like to be S.O.L.

107
00:06:50,936 --> 00:06:54,463
- S.O.L.?
- "Shit out of luck."

108
00:06:54,573 --> 00:06:58,441
What makes you think I'm S.O.L.?
Just because I spilt the salt back there?

109
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:00,135
Yeah.

110
00:07:00,245 --> 00:07:02,475
Oh!

111
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:06,775
Look. Where you are right now,
I've been there.

112
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:09,854
Been there? I lived there.
I was kind of the mayor of there.

113
00:07:12,257 --> 00:07:13,986
I'm Jake.

114
00:07:14,092 --> 00:07:16,322
Ashley.

115
00:07:16,428 --> 00:07:18,396
- Oh, God.
- Yeah, yeah. No, you got it.

116
00:07:18,497 --> 00:07:20,431
- Oh, my gosh.
- Looks great on you.

117
00:07:20,532 --> 00:07:23,330
Can anything else—
I mean, to be honest...

118
00:07:23,435 --> 00:07:25,960
I'm not really dressed for
a job interview right now.

119
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:27,868
For this one
I think you'll be fine.

120
00:07:27,973 --> 00:07:29,941
- Okay.
- Wanna check it out?

121
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:33,101
- Why are you so nice?
- Why—Just— Look. I mean...

122
00:07:33,211 --> 00:07:35,873
shit out of luck—
That's my thing.

123
00:07:35,981 --> 00:07:38,006
<i>...</i>put me in this position.
- You're gonna love her.

124
00:07:38,116 --> 00:07:40,084
- This is not fair. Listen.
- She's great.

125
00:07:40,185 --> 00:07:43,586
- I don't need another loser waitress here.
- Okay, Mac. Okay.

126
00:07:43,688 --> 00:07:46,748
You won't be sorry.

127
00:07:46,858 --> 00:07:50,555
- I didn't get it.
- No, no, no, no, no. No, no. It's not that.

128
00:07:50,662 --> 00:07:53,654
You can have the job,
but it's my old job.

129
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:55,562
So?

130
00:07:55,667 --> 00:07:58,966
Well, see, l— I'd hoped he would hire you
as a waitress or something.

131
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:04,133
My old gig was kind of a— like a janitor,
food delivery person, toilet attendant.

132
00:08:05,944 --> 00:08:07,844
I'll take it. I'll take it.

133
00:08:23,795 --> 00:08:26,355
Whoa! God!

134
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:28,694

Oh!

00:09:52,517 --> 00:09:55,179
What the—

146
00:09:59,024 --> 00:10:01,720
I'll clean that up.

147
00:10:10,535 --> 00:10:14,096
Come on, boys.
Move it or lose it. Let's go.

148
00:10:24,082 --> 00:10:26,016
There we go.

00:10:47,238 --> 00:10:49,570
- No way!
- That's it! That's it!

155
00:10:52,277 --> 00:10:54,404
Let's celebrate.
Burgers and fries on me.

156
00:10:54,512 --> 00:10:56,036
All right.

157
00:10:56,147 --> 00:11:00,550
Hey, sweetie. You, uh, scamper up
that ladder and— and fix that light.

158
00:11:00,652 --> 00:11:03,177
- Well, I'm not so good with—
- Thanks.

159
00:11:03,288 --> 00:11:05,188
Heights.

160
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:07,758
<i> That's McFly,</i>
<i>a new British invasion band</i>—

161
00:11:07,859 --> 00:11:12,421
Phillips will tell us tonight. In the meantime,
we have to focus on fine-tuning—

162
00:11:15,266 --> 00:11:16,927
Whoa.

163
00:11:17,035 --> 00:11:19,230
Track—
See, that's not good.

164
00:11:20,872 --> 00:11:23,204
<i>She should have gone up</i>
<i>without the bulb...</i>

165
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:25,868
then brought down the old one,
because now she's gonna be juggling—

166
00:11:27,445 --> 00:11:29,072
Eh! Hey!

167
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:31,705
- You know where the broom is.
- Yeah. I'll—

168
00:11:35,453 --> 00:11:39,116
And she should have turned off the light
first because now she's gonna be—

169
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:42,786
Electrocuted.

170
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:47,130
- Oh, my God.
- Hi.

171
00:11:47,232 --> 00:11:49,132
Hi.

172
00:11:49,234 --> 00:11:52,692
So, other than, uh, you know,
getting zapped, how's the job working out?

173
00:11:52,804 --> 00:11:54,704
- Oh, I can't complain.
<i>- That's good.</i>

174
00:11:54,806 --> 00:11:58,469
No. I mean I'm literally not allowed
to complain. I had to sign something.

175
00:11:58,576 --> 00:12:00,567
Oh. I remember that.

176
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:04,136
- This is cold, so it'll help.
- You're very handy with this stuff.

177
00:12:04,249 --> 00:12:07,412
- Thanks.
- Ah, that feels good.

178
00:12:10,321 --> 00:12:15,554
- Is that toothpaste?
- Yeah. It's an ancient Chinese
remedy for burned fingers.

179
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:18,754
Yeah. It pays to be prepared.

180
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:20,763
I've got everything in this backpack.

181
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:23,299
I have first aid, extra socks.

182
00:12:23,401 --> 00:12:26,859
- Isn't that a bit defeatist?
- No, it's being a realist. You've been out there.

183
00:12:26,971 --> 00:12:29,269
Hey. Let me see your cell phone.

184
00:12:29,374 --> 00:12:31,274
Why?

185
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:34,903
- What the—What is this?
- Oh. Flip it like that.

186
00:12:35,013 --> 00:12:36,913
Like that.

187
00:12:37,015 --> 00:12:39,142
Address book.

188
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:41,218
"Bergdorf's, Bendel's and sushi."

189
00:12:41,319 --> 00:12:45,585
Are you nuts?
Unlucky people need hospitals.

190
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:48,215
<i>Also, never call 911.</i>
<i>They take forever.</i>

191
00:12:48,326 --> 00:12:50,920
Fire responds. They're great.

192
00:12:51,029 --> 00:12:53,497
National Poison Control Center.
Ask for Lou. He's very good.

193
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:00,995
You know what? Um...

194
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:04,940
this backpack has seen me through
just about everything.

195
00:13:05,043 --> 00:13:06,476
<i>And...</i>

196
00:13:06,578 --> 00:13:08,944
I think it's time to pass it on.

197
00:13:09,047 --> 00:13:12,642
- Oh. No, no, no. I couldn't.
- No. No. Honestly, I think you should have it.

198
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:15,548
- Please. You need it more than I do.
- Thank you.

199
00:13:21,593 --> 00:13:23,993
Uh, I better take this.

200
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:29,032
- Oh, yeah. Sure. Of course.
- Hey, Katy. How's my girl? What?

201
00:13:29,133 --> 00:13:32,068
Your key? You checked the doormat?

202
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:36,038
Um, okay. What—What if I pick you up,
take you to the new place?

203
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:38,404
Yeah. You'll love it.
It's huge.

204
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:41,070
<i>Okay. We'll have pizza.</i>
<i>It'll be fun.</i>

205
00:13:41,179 --> 00:13:44,910
- I gotta run.
- Okay. Uh, yeah.

206
00:13:45,016 --> 00:13:48,850
<i>See ya, Ashley. Uh, it's just a</i>—
<i>It's a girl. Yeah. No.</i>

207
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:21,209
Hey. Guys. Guys. Guys. Come on.

208
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:24,117
- Hey, guys. Sounds good.
- How you doing? Thank you.

209
00:14:24,222 --> 00:14:27,191
- What's going on?
- Look, Jake. The Knitting Factory fell through.

210
00:14:27,292 --> 00:14:29,522
- What?
- Oh, you're joking.

211
00:14:29,627 --> 00:14:32,892
- That sucks.
- But "Five Colours" has been
gettin' great radio play...

212
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:37,434
<i>so I decided to book our boys</i>
<i>at the new Hard Rock Cafe Times Square.</i>

213
00:14:37,535 --> 00:14:39,059
No way!

214
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:41,934
- Who's your boy, huh? This is big!
<i>- Beauty!</i>

215
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:45,976
This is—This is big. How's my follow-up coming?

216
00:14:46,077 --> 00:14:48,238
We're—We're working on it.

217
00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:51,440
- Uh—
- All right. That's good. Don't let me stop you.

218
00:14:51,549 --> 00:14:54,780
- Sounds good, guys. Congratulations.
- All right. Have a good one.

219
00:14:54,886 --> 00:14:59,118
So, um, Jake, when are we gonna
hear this amazing follow-up?

220
00:14:59,223 --> 00:15:02,283
- When you guys write it.
- Right.

221
00:15:03,494 --> 00:15:05,655
Hey, Jake.
You got a delivery.

222
00:15:07,098 --> 00:15:08,827
Over there.

223
00:15:08,933 --> 00:15:11,458
<i> Hey. Isn't that that bird</i>
<i>from the bowling alley?</i>

224
00:15:11,569 --> 00:15:14,003
<i>- Yeah. The electrocuted one.</i>
<i>- Hey, Jakey.</i>

225
00:15:14,105 --> 00:15:16,539
Danny, let's work on your vocals
for "Too Close for Comfort."

226
00:15:16,641 --> 00:15:19,633
I think we're on the right track.
Just tighten it up a little bit.

227
00:15:19,744 --> 00:15:22,338
Okay. We're—We're gonna take it
from the second verse.

228
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:27,250
- Hey.
- Hey.

229
00:15:27,352 --> 00:15:29,843
- Oh! I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

230
00:15:29,954 --> 00:15:33,219
- Thanks. Oh!
- I got it. I got it. I got it.

231
00:15:35,793 --> 00:15:38,785
- I'm— I'm sorry about—
- No. Don't worry about it.

232
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:40,955
Come on in.
Check out this song.

233
00:15:43,434 --> 00:15:46,232
Sounds great, Tim.

234
00:15:49,974 --> 00:15:52,340
- They sound good.
- Yeah. Yeah. They do, don't they?

235
00:15:52,443 --> 00:15:55,276
- Yeah.
- So, did you hear we're playing
the new Hard Rock?

236
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:58,543
- Wow. That's great.
- Yeah. Well, besides the fact
that it's a huge space...

237
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:00,777
I'm probably not gonna
be able to fill it...

238
00:16:00,885 --> 00:16:03,649
- and I'm kind of dead.
- It's tough, but not impossible.

239
00:16:14,165 --> 00:16:17,692
So, you think maybe, uh,
you'd want to go to coffee later...

240
00:16:17,802 --> 00:16:20,270
or something maybe?

241
00:16:20,371 --> 00:16:23,568
Yeah, um—
That'd be nice.

242
00:16:29,447 --> 00:16:31,847
Oh. There she is.

243
00:16:35,486 --> 00:16:38,250
- Oh. Is— Is that Katy?
- Yeah.

244
00:16:38,356 --> 00:16:40,688
She's cute, huh?
She picked out this jacket.

245
00:16:40,792 --> 00:16:43,420
- Oh. Nice.
- Yeah.

246
00:16:45,697 --> 00:16:47,858
- Looks like a tramp.
- What?

247
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:52,061
What? Camp. Camp. She looks
like someone I went to camp with.

248
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:54,070
- Yeah.
- Strange.

249
00:16:54,172 --> 00:16:56,072
Weird.

250
00:16:56,174 --> 00:16:59,769
You know, l— I better get going.
Uh, Mac wants me to reset the rat trap.

251
00:16:59,877 --> 00:17:01,777
So, should I call you tonight?

252
00:17:01,879 --> 00:17:04,541
Um, yeah, about that—
Oh, geez.

253
00:17:04,649 --> 00:17:08,415
Um, yeah. Some other time maybe.
I have other plans.

254
00:17:08,519 --> 00:17:11,682
<i>- If that's cool. Sorry about that again.</i>
- That's okay.

255
00:17:11,789 --> 00:17:13,689
- Bye.
- Bye.

256
00:17:18,496 --> 00:17:20,691
Oh!

257
00:17:32,276 --> 00:17:34,801
- Thanks for the ride, Jake.
- Yeah. Hold up one second.

258
00:17:36,714 --> 00:17:38,682
Um, so I'll see you later?

259
00:17:38,783 --> 00:17:42,082
Tell Aunt Martha I'm gonna send
Bernie with the car to pick you up.
Don't forget your homework.

260
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:44,814
- Yeah, yeah. I hear ya. Later.
- All right. See ya.

261
00:17:53,264 --> 00:17:55,289
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Don't do that.

262
00:17:55,399 --> 00:17:58,095
Don't open the umbrella.
Not inside.

263
00:17:58,202 --> 00:17:59,760
Very unlucky.

264
00:18:17,355 --> 00:18:19,346
- Bernie.
<i>- Yes, sir?</i>

265
00:18:19,457 --> 00:18:21,948
Back it up, will ya?

266
00:18:28,933 --> 00:18:30,901
Oh, God.

267
00:18:35,706 --> 00:18:37,936
You know, there's a poncho
in that backpack.

268
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:41,938
I didn't even think to— to look.

269
00:18:42,046 --> 00:18:44,173
Can I give you a ride?

270
00:18:44,282 --> 00:18:47,342
I only live 29 blocks from here.

271
00:18:48,452 --> 00:18:50,886
Uh, at least take my umbrella.

272
00:18:50,988 --> 00:18:53,479
I already have one.

273
00:18:53,591 --> 00:18:56,788
You know,
I got a washer-dryer, uh...

274
00:18:56,894 --> 00:19:00,295
microwave popcorn,
satellite TV.

275
00:19:00,398 --> 00:19:03,834
No. L— l—
I really shouldn't.

276
00:19:03,935 --> 00:19:07,336
Look. I don't do this
for just anybody, but...

277
00:19:07,438 --> 00:19:10,839
I'll even throw in some hot chocolate
with those little tiny marshmallows.

278
00:19:14,212 --> 00:19:16,180
I love the tiny marshmallows.

279
00:19:17,849 --> 00:19:20,750
How about you toss
the lightning rod and get in?

280
00:19:20,852 --> 00:19:22,820
Oh.

281
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:26,757
Thank you.

282
00:19:47,211 --> 00:19:49,111
- Nice place.
- Yeah. Um—

283
00:19:49,213 --> 00:19:51,943
We should get you some dry clothes.
Here. Let me get this.

284
00:19:52,049 --> 00:19:54,950
- Oh, thank you.
- Laundry room's that way.
Bathroom's right over there.

285
00:19:55,052 --> 00:19:58,112
Uh, kitchen's right here. Go whichever way
you think you should go.

286
00:19:58,222 --> 00:20:00,190
- Thanks.
- Yeah. Sure.

287
00:20:05,029 --> 00:20:08,123
Mind if I throw some of my clothes
in with yours?

288
00:20:08,232 --> 00:20:11,065
No. Not at all. Wow.
Laundry room in your apartment.

289
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:15,264
- As far as I'm concerned,
that's when you know you've arrived.
- Yeah. It's pretty cool.

290
00:20:15,373 --> 00:20:18,399
You know what?
I should wash this too. Hold on.

291
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:21,478
Okay.

292
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:34,451
Oh. Oh, shoot.

293
00:20:34,558 --> 00:20:38,085
- Toss this in for me, will ya?
- Um, yeah. Sure.

294
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:40,095
Thanks.

295
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:43,633
- Oh. I should get this. I'll be right back.
- Okay. I'll be in here.

296
00:20:47,238 --> 00:20:49,638
Since when does a washing machine
need an L.C.D. Screen?

297
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:52,140
Okay.

298
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:09,791
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.
What is going on?

299
00:21:09,894 --> 00:21:12,192
Oh, my gosh.

300
00:21:12,296 --> 00:21:14,526
Oh, no!

301
00:21:14,632 --> 00:21:17,795
Stop! Please stop! Stop!

302
00:21:17,902 --> 00:21:21,303
Um, off.

303
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:22,872
Off!

304
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:26,342
What are you, possessed? Oh!

305
00:21:26,444 --> 00:21:31,108
- Everything okay in there?
- Yeah! Everything's fine.

306
00:21:31,215 --> 00:21:33,183
- Okay.
<i>- Oh!</i>

307
00:21:35,086 --> 00:21:38,522
What is going on?
Okay. Water off.

308
00:21:38,622 --> 00:21:40,715
Water off! Oh!

309
00:21:40,825 --> 00:21:43,350
Oh, God!

310
00:21:43,461 --> 00:21:45,520
Off! Off!

311
00:21:45,629 --> 00:21:47,324
No, not spin!

312
00:21:49,066 --> 00:21:51,125
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

313
00:21:51,235 --> 00:21:53,135
Hello?

314
00:21:57,074 --> 00:21:59,702
Oh, my God. Oh!

315
00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:02,506
<i>- Stop! Please stop!</i>
<i>- Okay. Uh</i>—

316
00:22:02,613 --> 00:22:04,513
I'm sorry.

317
00:22:04,615 --> 00:22:06,344
I'm so sorry.

318
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:09,010
I got it. I got it. I got—

319
00:22:12,623 --> 00:22:14,818
How'd you do that?

320
00:22:14,925 --> 00:22:17,655
Uh, there's a— there's an off button
on the L.C.D. Screen.

321
00:22:19,397 --> 00:22:24,198
What can I say? I am a pathetic
disaster, and I give up.

322
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:27,395
- You give up?
- I give up. I don't care anymore.

323
00:22:27,505 --> 00:22:29,769
You know what?
It feels great.

324
00:22:32,343 --> 00:22:36,473
You know what? I gave up years ago.
It's my secret to happiness.

325
00:22:38,949 --> 00:22:42,009
Oh! Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

326
00:22:42,119 --> 00:22:44,349
- Play fair.
- Oh.

327
00:22:44,455 --> 00:22:45,922
- Ow.
- Oh, no.

328
00:22:46,023 --> 00:22:47,115
- Oh, man.
- Your eye?

329
00:22:47,224 --> 00:22:48,623
- You're done.
- I'm sorry.

330
00:22:48,726 --> 00:22:50,626
No.

331
00:22:53,164 --> 00:22:56,224
Oh, cool!

332
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:59,063
Oh, am I interrupting something?

333
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:01,536
- Hi, Katy.
- Hi.

334
00:23:01,639 --> 00:23:05,871
- Wait. You're Katy?
- Last time I checked.

335
00:23:07,144 --> 00:23:09,044
Hi. I'm Ashley.

336
00:23:11,916 --> 00:23:14,817
<i>No. No, that's not a problem.</i>
<i>I'm on it. Yeah.</i>

337
00:23:14,919 --> 00:23:17,410
So, Jake tells me you're a loser.

338
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:19,785
What? I'm not a loser.

339
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:21,619
That's cool.
I'm a loser too.

340
00:23:21,725 --> 00:23:25,388
Anyway, it's just like a term of affection,
not a permanent condition.

341
00:23:25,496 --> 00:23:27,987
- Oh.
- You just haven't had any good luck. That's all.

342
00:23:28,099 --> 00:23:29,623
No, no. It's great.

343
00:23:29,733 --> 00:23:31,462
I love these
little marshmallow things.

344
00:23:31,569 --> 00:23:33,867
So do I.

345
00:23:33,971 --> 00:23:37,065
Okay. Yeah. Yeah.
We'll talk later. All right, sir. Bye.

346
00:23:37,174 --> 00:23:39,074
<i>- Oh, my God.</i>
- Hot.

347
00:23:39,176 --> 00:23:43,738
- What's the problem?
- Oh, Phillips wants the new
song ready before the concert.

348
00:23:43,848 --> 00:23:46,112
- And?
- And we don't have shit.

349
00:23:48,519 --> 00:23:50,851
I mean shoot.
We don't have shoot.

350
00:23:50,955 --> 00:23:53,788
<i>We don't have to tell Aunt Martha</i>
<i>about this, do we?</i>

351
00:23:53,891 --> 00:23:56,485
<i>Don't stress it.</i>
<i>I'll write you a kick-ass song.</i>

352
00:23:56,594 --> 00:23:59,324
<i>Oh, so you're a</i>—<i>you're a songwriter now?</i>
<i>Very funny.</i>

353
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:01,330
- You could be more supportive.
- This is serious.

354
00:24:01,432 --> 00:24:03,332
- This is my life we're—
- Guy— Guys—

355
00:24:03,434 --> 00:24:05,334
- No shoot.
- No shoot. That—

356
00:24:05,436 --> 00:24:07,961
Uh— I think I can help you out.

357
00:24:08,072 --> 00:24:09,664
What do you have in mind?

358
00:24:09,773 --> 00:24:12,264
Well, I have this friend—

359
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:34,624
What a song.

360
00:24:36,967 --> 00:24:40,061
I totally understand. If you don't
want to use it, it's cool.

361
00:24:40,171 --> 00:24:42,036
No. No, it's great.

362
00:24:42,139 --> 00:24:44,232
<i>Just a few little adjustments.</i>

363
00:24:44,341 --> 00:24:46,332
Hey, Harry.
Double the tempo.

364
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:49,742
Danny, Tom, why don't you
kick it off tight and rough it up a bit?

365
00:25:08,465 --> 00:25:11,366
- Ashley.
- Yeah?

366
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:15,063
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

367
00:25:34,458 --> 00:25:36,358
Hey.

368
00:25:37,394 --> 00:25:40,056
So I hear a rumor that, uh,
you have another hit for me.

369
00:25:40,164 --> 00:25:43,395
Well, it's, uh— it's rough,
but I got a good feeling, sir. Yeah.

370
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:46,492
Sounds good. Positivity.
That's what I like.

371
00:25:46,604 --> 00:25:48,970
Oh, yeah. Congratulations
on, uh, selling out.

372
00:25:49,073 --> 00:25:51,041
Selling out?

373
00:25:51,141 --> 00:25:54,008
You mean the Hard Rock?
We sold out the Hard Rock?

374
00:25:54,111 --> 00:25:56,045
- I BlackBerried you.
- I don't have a BlackBerry.

375
00:25:56,146 --> 00:25:58,046
- Tiffany, get him a BlackBerry.
- Yes.

376
00:25:58,148 --> 00:26:01,584
- There's a line around the corner
of people just hoping to get in.
- Ah?

377
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:04,279
Hey, hey, hey. I don't hug people,
but, look, bro.

378
00:26:04,388 --> 00:26:07,755
You saved my life twice. Once
at the masquerade bash and— and now.

379
00:26:07,858 --> 00:26:09,826
<i>L</i>— <i>It was</i>
<i>a great night for me too.</i>

380
00:26:09,927 --> 00:26:13,226
I mean, ever since then I've been
about the luckiest guy in the worid.

381
00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:16,788
Look. Come by my office later.

382
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:18,800
- It can't be.
<i>- I got some ideas.</i>

383
00:26:18,902 --> 00:26:21,166
<i>- Okay.</i>
<i>- Geez.</i>

384
00:26:21,272 --> 00:26:23,900
Jake. Jake is the guy I kissed
at the masquerade bash.

385
00:26:24,008 --> 00:26:25,305
- Uh-uh.
- Yes.

386
00:26:25,409 --> 00:26:26,603
- No.
- Yes.

387
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:28,109
- No.
- Yes.

388
00:26:28,212 --> 00:26:31,613
Yes! That's great. He's hot.

389
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:33,649
You don't understand.
If I kiss Jake...

390
00:26:33,751 --> 00:26:36,982
it's hello,
fabulous carefree life.

391
00:26:37,087 --> 00:26:39,578
And that's a problem?

392
00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:42,682
- Well—
- Go.

393
00:27:04,214 --> 00:27:06,114
- Ashley.
- No, no, no.

394
00:27:06,216 --> 00:27:08,150
Um, I have to go now.

395
00:27:08,252 --> 00:27:11,983
Uh, now?

396
00:27:21,665 --> 00:27:23,292
- Whoa!
<i>- Oh, my God.</i>

397
00:27:32,643 --> 00:27:35,510
Taxi!

398
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:38,479
Sorry. I was just
checking something.

399
00:27:43,987 --> 00:27:46,649
Five dollars. Yes.

400
00:27:46,757 --> 00:27:48,691
- Thank you, luck.
- Ashley?

401
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:50,726
Miss Braden.

402
00:27:50,828 --> 00:27:53,388
Listen. I am so sorry for—

403
00:27:53,497 --> 00:27:55,658
- Antonio?
- Hey, Ash.

404
00:27:55,766 --> 00:27:58,326
- Hi.
- How lucky that we ran into you.

405
00:27:58,435 --> 00:28:01,097
I feel just horrible about
those things I said to you.

406
00:28:01,205 --> 00:28:03,571
No. Stop. You were right
to blame it all on me.

407
00:28:03,674 --> 00:28:09,237
Then let me blame you for bringing this sweet,
wonderful, iron-tushed man into my life.

408
00:28:09,346 --> 00:28:11,371
Yes. We're getting married, baby.

409
00:28:11,482 --> 00:28:14,110
- No way!
- It's true. I bought him the ring.

410
00:28:14,218 --> 00:28:17,949
- Well, good for you guys. Congratulations.
<i>- Ashley...</i>

411
00:28:18,055 --> 00:28:20,250
I want you to come back
to work for me.

412
00:28:22,025 --> 00:28:25,688
- Are you kidding?
- I can't lose you. You are my good luck charm.

413
00:28:25,796 --> 00:28:27,423
L— I don't know what to say.

414
00:28:27,531 --> 00:28:31,092
Well, we have a huge pitch tonight.
St. Regis at 8:00.

415
00:28:31,201 --> 00:28:33,669
So, say you'll be by my side...

416
00:28:33,771 --> 00:28:37,298
and say you'll be wearing something
appropriate to your new vice president title.

417
00:28:37,408 --> 00:28:41,071
Oh, my gosh. Yes. Yes.
Thank you.

418
00:28:41,178 --> 00:28:43,078
- Bye.
- Bye.

419
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:45,774
Oh! Yes! My luck is back!

420
00:28:45,883 --> 00:28:47,783
Oh, my God.

421
00:28:49,553 --> 00:28:51,817
- Hello.
<i>- Ash?</i>

422
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:54,824
Anyone want some late lunch?

423
00:28:54,925 --> 00:28:56,859
<i>- Hi.</i>
<i>- Hi.</i>

424
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,292
Hey. I have some surprises.

425
00:28:59,396 --> 00:29:03,389
Ta-da! Last one in stock,
and just my size. Lucky, huh?

426
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:06,333
- Yeah.
- And I went to Miyakami
and got two orders of everything...

427
00:29:06,437 --> 00:29:08,962
'cause I thought we could use
a little celebration.

428
00:29:09,072 --> 00:29:12,235
- That's nice.
- Oh. Yeah.

429
00:29:12,342 --> 00:29:14,105
What's wrong?

430
00:29:14,211 --> 00:29:16,805
The band isn't
gonna do Maggie's song.

431
00:29:16,914 --> 00:29:18,575
What? Why not?

432
00:29:18,682 --> 00:29:21,173
Phillips is superstitious.

433
00:29:21,285 --> 00:29:23,014
- Come on.
<i>- He thinks that new groups...</i>

434
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,850
should only perform music
that they've written themselves.

435
00:29:25,956 --> 00:29:28,584
- That's crazy.
- No. It's just bad luck.

436
00:29:28,692 --> 00:29:31,991
<i>Look. I'm sorry this is happening.</i>
<i>I didn't have anything to do with</i>—

437
00:29:32,095 --> 00:29:35,929
Ashley, stop. It's not your fault.
It's life. Right?

438
00:29:36,033 --> 00:29:40,527
Come on. We gotta get going. We gotta get
there before they go on. I want to wish them luck.

439
00:29:40,637 --> 00:29:45,006
- You're still going?
- Oh, yeah. We have V.I.P.
Tickets. Why waste 'em? You?

440
00:29:45,108 --> 00:29:49,340
Um, actually, I'm not. I have, um, a meeting.

441
00:29:49,446 --> 00:29:52,313
- Job interview?
- Actually, it's a funny story.

442
00:29:52,416 --> 00:29:56,318
- Um, Peggy rehired me.
<i>- Ashley!</i>

443
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:58,547
I am so proud of you.

444
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:03,025
You totally stuck it out,
and it all got better.

445
00:30:03,126 --> 00:30:05,219
Are you sure
you're gonna be okay?

446
00:30:05,329 --> 00:30:07,229
Of course.
What choice do I have?

447
00:30:07,331 --> 00:30:09,561
If you dwell on
all the bad things in life...

448
00:30:09,666 --> 00:30:12,157
- you miss out on all the good things.
- It's getting late.

449
00:30:12,269 --> 00:30:14,965
- Well, have fun.
- Good luck on your meeting, Ashley.

450
00:30:15,072 --> 00:30:17,063
Thanks.

451
00:30:18,108 --> 00:30:20,167
<i>Bye.</i>

452
00:31:01,552 --> 00:31:03,486
Cool!

453
00:31:03,587 --> 00:31:06,420

All right. Guys, guys. Final touches.
Dressing room now. Come on.

464
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:38,582
<i> Thank you.</i>
<i>That would be great.</i>

465
00:31:38,689 --> 00:31:41,283
<i>The monitors hot</i>

466
00:31:41,391 --> 00:31:43,552
<i>- The input for the reverb</i>

<i>- Two and three.</i>

467
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:46,493
<i>Good. Andjust remember.</i>
<i>The switch-outs at three, five and nine.</i>

468
00:31:46,597 --> 00:31:49,896
- Right. Right.
- Someone could fall down
in this. I'm gonna shut it.

469
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,729
Whoa!

470
00:31:51,835 --> 00:31:53,894
<i>Hello?</i>

471
00:31:54,004 --> 00:31:55,733
Jake? Guys?

472
00:31:55,839 --> 00:31:58,603
Cab! Taxi!

473
00:31:58,709 --> 00:32:01,507
- Oy!
- We're never gonna get a cab at this hour.

474
00:32:01,612 --> 00:32:04,581
Think positive.

475
00:32:04,681 --> 00:32:07,343
Hey. Guys.
Jump in. Come on.

476
00:32:07,451 --> 00:32:09,646
Ashley.

477
00:32:11,455 --> 00:32:14,185
- Let's go. We don't have much time.
- What are you doing?

478
00:32:15,792 --> 00:32:17,919
I can't stop sweatin'.

479
00:32:18,028 --> 00:32:19,928
<i> Shocking!</i>

480
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:21,930

- Yeah. Stoked.

481
00:32:22,032 --> 00:32:23,795
Yeah. Born ready.

482

00:32:26,603 --> 00:32:28,468
<i>Danny, look at me.</i>
<i>You can see, right?</i>

484
00:32:28,572 --> 00:32:30,540
See, please?

485
00:32:30,641 --> 00:32:32,541
Two minutes, you guys.
Good luck.

<i>Two minutes?</i>
<i>L</i>— <i>I need some ice. I need some ice.</i>

487
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:42,414
Hello!

488
00:32:42,519 --> 00:32:45,010
Guys, I'm here!

489
00:32:45,122 --> 00:32:48,353
Okay. Look. I know you guys
are nervous. That's fine. Just—

490
00:32:48,458 --> 00:32:50,289
Hold that thought.

491
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:57,464
Good idea.

492
00:32:57,567 --> 00:33:01,298
- Whoo!
- Air fre—Air freshener.

493
00:33:01,405 --> 00:33:03,498
Oh, by the way, have you seen
Harry anywhere?

494
00:33:06,276 --> 00:33:08,335
He's— He's not here?

495
00:33:11,548 --> 00:33:13,539
Hello?

496
00:33:16,653 --> 00:33:18,848
- Okay, guys. Spread out, find him.
- All right.

497
00:33:18,955 --> 00:33:20,855
- Nick. Nick.
- Harry.

498
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:22,891
- Yeah.
- Uh, have you seen— have you seen Harry?

499
00:33:22,993 --> 00:33:24,961
- Who?
- Harry the drummer.

500
00:33:25,062 --> 00:33:28,054
- Who?
- Uh— Harry!

501
00:33:28,165 --> 00:33:30,395
Harry!

502
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:32,400
Harry.

503
00:33:32,502 --> 00:33:34,402
- Harry.
<i>- Get out of here!</i>

504
00:33:34,504 --> 00:33:36,062
<i>- Pervert!</i>
- Sorry.

505
00:33:42,212 --> 00:33:45,113
D.M.R.'s got the money, baby!

506
00:33:46,983 --> 00:33:50,384
Excuse me, sir. Could you make a left
up ahead? Union Square's always a mess.

507
00:33:50,487 --> 00:33:52,387
I can't believe
you blew off Peggy Braden.

508
00:33:52,489 --> 00:33:55,424
She'll get over it. If Jake's bad luck
is half as bad as mine was...

509
00:33:55,525 --> 00:33:57,493
then we don't have much time.

510
00:33:59,963 --> 00:34:02,796
Harry. Harry, are you in here?

511
00:34:02,899 --> 00:34:04,799
- Hey. Has anyone seen Harry?
- No.

512
00:34:04,901 --> 00:34:07,802
- Excuse me. Has anyone
seen Harry? The drummer.
- No.

513
00:34:07,904 --> 00:34:10,896
- Harry!
- Has— Has anybody got a 20 on the drummer?

514
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:12,907
What's he look like?

515
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:15,409
Yeah. I don't know.
They all look alike to me.

516
00:34:17,948 --> 00:34:20,280
Harry!

517
00:34:22,619 --> 00:34:24,587
Harry.

518
00:34:26,423 --> 00:34:28,448
- Harry.
<i>- Start the show!</i>

519
00:34:28,558 --> 00:34:30,526
Harry.

520
00:34:30,627 --> 00:34:32,857
- He's not here.
<i>- We want McFly!</i>

521
00:34:32,963 --> 00:34:34,988
He's not here either.

522
00:34:37,734 --> 00:34:42,262
Ah, but then— No, no. No, no, no.

523
00:34:42,372 --> 00:34:44,272
- Jake, baby!
- Hey!

524
00:34:44,374 --> 00:34:47,468
I understand the drill— keep 'em waiting—
but the natives are gettin' restless.

525
00:34:47,577 --> 00:34:50,603
- We thought it was normal
to go up a half hour late.
<i>- Jake.</i>

526
00:34:50,714 --> 00:34:53,274
Jake, we can't find Harry anywhere.
He's not upstairs. He's gone.

527
00:34:53,383 --> 00:34:55,476
- Checked the loos. He's not in men's or women's.
- No.

528
00:34:55,585 --> 00:34:57,746
There something
you want to tell me, Jake?

529
00:34:58,955 --> 00:35:00,923
We—We have a problem.

530
00:35:05,462 --> 00:35:08,693
Hello?
What the hell is that?

531
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:19,268
- Oh! We're so late. Come on! Come on!
- Oh, my gosh!

532
00:35:19,376 --> 00:35:22,607
Thank you! Wait. You guys.
You guys. Backstage is this way.

533
00:35:22,712 --> 00:35:25,237
Come on. Hi. Excuse me.
Watch out, buddy.

534
00:35:25,348 --> 00:35:27,441
- Come on!
- Hold on a second, giris.

535
00:35:27,551 --> 00:35:29,542
Catch up, Dana.
You got the passes.

536
00:35:29,653 --> 00:35:31,382
<i>Let's go!</i>

537
00:35:31,488 --> 00:35:33,718
Hello.

<i>Hello.</i>

539
00:35:38,128 --> 00:35:40,028
And I, for one...

540
00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:44,726
am not looking forward to going
out here and telling this angry crowd...

541
00:35:44,835 --> 00:35:47,463
that the band decided
not to play.

542
00:35:47,571 --> 00:35:49,903
Oh. That won't be me.

543
00:35:50,006 --> 00:35:51,906
That's gonna be you.

544
00:35:52,008 --> 00:35:55,307
<i>Unless you get your boys</i>
<i>out there now!</i>

545
00:35:55,412 --> 00:35:57,312
<i>Mr. Phillips,</i>
<i>without a</i>—<i>a drummer?</i>

546
00:35:57,414 --> 00:35:59,314
- No way.
- It won't work.

547
00:35:59,416 --> 00:36:04,718
<i>Hey, guys. I used to be the, uh, backup</i>
<i>drummer for, uh, Whitesnake.</i>

548
00:36:04,821 --> 00:36:07,381
<i>- Whitesnake? Hell, yeah!</i>

549
00:36:07,490 --> 00:36:09,685
- There you go. Here's your drummer.
- Wait a minute.

550
00:36:09,793 --> 00:36:12,921
<i>- We're not gonna go out there without Harry.</i>
<i>- It's not gonna happen.</i>

551
00:36:13,029 --> 00:36:14,929
McFly doesn't play...

552
00:36:15,031 --> 00:36:16,931
you'll be lucky enough
to manage...

553
00:36:17,033 --> 00:36:18,557
- a high school marching band.
<i>- Jake.</i>

554
00:36:18,668 --> 00:36:21,193
- Get out of the way.
- We got a problem. We need a new band.

555
00:36:21,304 --> 00:36:24,569
<i>- Cancel the limo.</i>
- Get out of the way, please. All right. Now go.

556
00:36:24,674 --> 00:36:26,574
Ashley, now's not a—

557
00:36:26,676 --> 00:36:29,270
- What the hell is this?
- Shh!

558
00:36:36,086 --> 00:36:40,887
And in nine, eight, seven—

559
00:36:41,892 --> 00:36:45,020
- Oh, no.
- Who hit the smoke?

560
00:36:45,128 --> 00:36:48,962
Five, four, three—

561
00:36:50,066 --> 00:36:52,296
Whoa.

562
00:36:52,402 --> 00:36:54,267
Two—

563
00:36:57,908 --> 00:36:59,273
Whoa.

564
00:36:59,376 --> 00:37:01,071
Is that— Is that Harry?

565
00:37:04,981 --> 00:37:08,041
<i>Get started, baby!</i>

566
00:37:08,151 --> 00:37:10,381
We're on. We're on.

567
00:37:10,487 --> 00:37:13,820
No way. The freak went on without us.

568
00:37:13,924 --> 00:37:16,290
I don't believe it.

569
00:37:20,330 --> 00:37:22,764
Hey. Do me a favor.

570
00:37:22,866 --> 00:37:25,892
- Play Maggie's song.
- Absolutely.

571
00:37:26,002 --> 00:37:28,027
Hey. Let's kick it off
with "I've Got You."

572
00:37:28,138 --> 00:37:30,072
Yeah. Definitely.
Come on. Let's go.

573

<i>- Who cares?</i>

574
00:37:38,581 --> 00:37:41,948
Harry. Harry, we're playing
"I've Got You."

575
00:37:48,224 --> 00:37:50,522
Ashley. Thank you.

576
00:37:50,627 --> 00:37:53,323
You're welcome.

577
00:37:59,803 --> 00:38:02,829
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. Yeah. I'm okay.

578
00:38:02,939 --> 00:38:04,998
Oh, I'm proud of you.

579
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:34,528
- Katy!
- Yes!

580
00:38:34,637 --> 00:38:36,730
- They're great!
- It's good!

581
00:38:48,084 --> 00:38:49,813
Danny! Whoo!

582
00:38:51,121 --> 00:38:53,589
I thought I told you
not to play this song.

583
00:38:54,758 --> 00:38:57,727
Well, I guess
I'm not superstitious.

584
00:38:57,827 --> 00:39:00,318
But I am.

585
00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:02,830
I should fire you, Jake.

586
00:39:02,932 --> 00:39:05,696
But it works.

587
00:39:05,802 --> 00:39:08,270
It works. Good job.

588
00:39:09,506 --> 00:39:11,030
Thank you.

589
00:39:18,982 --> 00:39:21,246
They're playing my song!

590
00:39:42,572 --> 00:39:45,598
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

591
00:39:47,310 --> 00:39:49,210
Is that the sound
of them clapping...

592
00:39:49,312 --> 00:39:51,473
- or my nervous system shutting down?
- No. They're clapping.

593
00:39:51,581 --> 00:39:53,446
Hello, Times Square!

- Hey. Um, not now.

607
00:41:03,219 --> 00:41:05,119
What's wrong with you?
You look miserable.

608
00:41:07,257 --> 00:41:09,885
Maggie,
I think I've fallen for him.

609
00:41:11,928 --> 00:41:16,126
That's great.
What's the matter with that?

610
00:41:16,232 --> 00:41:22,137
I don't know. I mean, the feelings
I have generally lead toward kissing.

611
00:41:22,238 --> 00:41:24,832
So kiss him. Kiss him!

612
00:41:24,941 --> 00:41:27,375
I can't.

613
00:41:27,477 --> 00:41:29,445
Oh, Ash.

614
00:41:29,546 --> 00:41:32,709
Please don't tell me
you still believe in that stuff.

615
00:41:32,815 --> 00:41:35,249
More than ever.

616
00:41:35,351 --> 00:41:37,649
And I can't not kiss him.

617
00:41:41,624 --> 00:41:43,751
- I gotta go.
- What? Where are you going?

618
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:45,384
Grand Central.

619
00:41:45,495 --> 00:41:48,953
<i>I'm gonna visit</i>
<i>my parents for a bit.</i>

620
00:41:49,065 --> 00:41:52,831
I have to sort things out.
Give me a hug, you.

621
00:41:52,936 --> 00:41:55,404
Have fun, okay?
And be careful.

622
00:41:55,505 --> 00:41:57,405
Okay.

623
00:41:59,108 --> 00:42:01,008
Bye.

624
00:42:04,681 --> 00:42:07,115
Gather round. Gather round.

625
00:42:21,898 --> 00:42:23,957
Of course.

626
00:42:24,067 --> 00:42:26,592
<i>You waitin'for a train?</i>

627
00:42:26,703 --> 00:42:30,070
I'm just saying if you are,
you might as well give up now.

628
00:42:30,173 --> 00:42:32,073
- Jake, please.
<i>- With your luck...</i>

629
00:42:32,175 --> 00:42:35,372
there's gonna be an announcement
that due to some freak accident
all trains have been canceled.

630
00:42:35,478 --> 00:42:37,639
<i>Then you're gonna go outside</i>
<i>and wait for the bus...</i>

631
00:42:37,747 --> 00:42:41,444
at which point the acid rain will commence—
perhaps even acid hail.

632
00:42:41,551 --> 00:42:45,112
Listen, Jake. I can't see you.
Okay? It's for your own good.

633
00:42:45,221 --> 00:42:47,382
Luck changes, Ashley.

634
00:42:47,490 --> 00:42:49,048
You know?

635
00:42:49,158 --> 00:42:53,458
You know, l— I kissed this amazing girl
at this masquerade party.

636
00:42:53,563 --> 00:42:56,896
No. Listen. I swear I'm not crazy, okay?
Our luck did get switched.

637
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,993
And it still is.
Here. I dare you not to win.

638
00:43:01,104 --> 00:43:04,403
So you think meeting me
was unlucky?

639
00:43:04,507 --> 00:43:08,273
No. God, I'm lucky
to have met you.

640
00:43:08,378 --> 00:43:10,437
Okay?
But you deserve my luck.

641
00:43:10,546 --> 00:43:14,448
- You put it to better use than I ever did.
- Well, I don't want it anymore.

642
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:16,916
- Are you crazy?
- I want you to have it.

643
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:20,148
- No. Go away.
- It's been great...

644
00:43:20,256 --> 00:43:22,224
but I'll be fine without it.

645
00:43:24,861 --> 00:43:27,091
How do you know that?

646
00:43:27,196 --> 00:43:29,664
Because I'll have you in my life.

647
00:43:29,766 --> 00:43:34,100
A few bumps and bruises along the way
are a small price to pay.

648
00:43:47,884 --> 00:43:49,852
Tag. You're it.

649
00:43:54,924 --> 00:43:58,519
Oh, no. You're not
gettin' away with it that easy.

650
00:44:01,964 --> 00:44:04,558
- Oh, yeah?
- Not a chance.

651
00:44:08,004 --> 00:44:10,472
So now who?

652
00:44:10,573 --> 00:44:12,541
Who cares?

653
00:44:16,145 --> 00:44:18,204
Ew! Gross!

654
00:44:18,314 --> 00:44:21,078
<i>You leave a kid sitting in a limo</i>
<i>so you can make out?</i>

655
00:44:21,184 --> 00:44:24,085
You take me from a perfectly good party
with really cute rock stars...

656
00:44:24,187 --> 00:44:26,087
I pop a shoelace,
swallow my gum...

657
00:44:26,189 --> 00:44:30,353
<i>and now I'm stuck here</i>
<i>watching you two play tonsil hockey.</i>

658
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:32,826
<i>- Good grief!</i>
- Katy.

659
00:44:35,031 --> 00:44:37,261
I am so glad you're here.

660
00:44:38,835 --> 00:44:41,531
Why are you guys
looking at me like this?

661
00:44:41,637 --> 00:44:44,731
Hold still. Mmm! Mmm! Mmm!

662
00:44:44,841 --> 00:44:47,969
Oh, I've been slimed!

663
00:44:48,077 --> 00:44:51,012
- Try this. You'll like it.
- It's fun.

664
00:44:51,114 --> 00:44:53,082
Cool.

665
00:44:56,285 --> 00:44:59,254
So, where were we just, like—

666
00:44:59,355 --> 00:45:00,583
- Ow.
- Ow.

667
00:45:00,690 --> 00:45:04,091
<i>Twenty-five bucks?</i>
<i>No freakin'way. I'm rich!</i>

668
00:45:04,193 --> 00:45:06,286
Oh, yeah! I'm rich!

669
00:45:06,396 --> 00:45:09,627
I'm taking the limo, okay?
This I gotta show Grams.

670
00:45:09,732 --> 00:45:12,428
I definitely hit the jackpot.

671
00:45:12,535 --> 00:45:15,902
<i>- Hey, Bernie!</i>
- Thank you.

672
00:45:17,673 --> 00:45:19,607
She deserves it.

673
00:45:19,709 --> 00:45:22,075
- Pizza?
- You're on.

674
00:45:24,313 --> 00:45:26,907
So, you think you can
adjust to life without luck?

675
00:45:27,016 --> 00:45:29,484
- Right now I've never felt luckier.
- Me too.

676
00:45:29,585 --> 00:45:32,019
- Do you believe in karma?
- Karma? Ash, you kidding me?

677
00:45:32,121 --> 00:45:36,057
One time I helped an old lady across the street.
Next day, I found a hundred-dollar bill.

678
00:45:36,159 --> 00:45:37,717
- Ash, that's luck.
- Karma.

679
00:45:37,827 --> 00:45:39,385
- It's luck.
- Karma, karma, karma.

680
00:45:39,495 --> 00:45:40,826
- Luck, luck, luck.
- It's karma.

681
00:45:40,930 --> 00:45:42,227
- It's luck.
- Get the door.

682
00:45:42,331 --> 00:45:46,267
Why, thank you.

683
00:45:46,369 --> 00:45:48,633
Hey.
Quarter.

684
00:45:48,738 --> 00:45:50,672
Hmm. Seems we still
have our luck.

685
00:45:50,773 --> 00:45:53,241
- Who cares?
- Absolutely.

686
00:45:55,845 --> 00:45:58,405
Hey! Shut the valve!
The pipe is broken.

687
00:45:59,405 --> 00:46:09,405
