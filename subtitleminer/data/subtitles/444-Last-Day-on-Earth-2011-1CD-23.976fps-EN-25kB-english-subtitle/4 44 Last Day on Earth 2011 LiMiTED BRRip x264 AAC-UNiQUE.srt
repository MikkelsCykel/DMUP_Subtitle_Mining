327
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:49,046
I don't want to leave you.

328
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:00,849
These guys chopped down

329
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:05,312
every fucking tree
on the island

330
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:07,356
to make a statue.

331
00:26:07,357 --> 00:26:08,691
Fuck.

332
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:13,862
And they don't have anything
to build a boat to get the fish.

333
00:26:16,616 --> 00:26:18,450
At least they were doing-

334
00:26:18,451 --> 00:26:20,744
worshipping God-
the fucking-

335
00:26:23,206 --> 00:26:25,082
I shouldn't be saying that.

336

Fuck that book!

00:26:55,405 --> 00:26:57,573
What is wrong with you people?

340
00:26:57,574 --> 00:26:59,908
Leave that man alone!

341
00:26:59,909 --> 00:27:01,910
What is wrong with you?

342
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:07,916
- Baby.

343
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:09,335
- Come on.

344
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:15,090
Come on.
What are we waiting for?

345
00:27:15,091 --> 00:27:17,676
- I'm waiting for you
to come down.

346
00:27:17,677 --> 00:27:18,886
Come on.

347
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:21,180
- What are we waiting for?

348
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:23,515
A couple hours' difference?
- Get down, Cisco.

00:27:23,516 --> 00:27:25,225
Come on.

350
00:27:25,226 --> 00:27:30,230
Get down.

Hey.

357
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:24,868
- What?

358
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:25,994
- Come on.

359
00:28:25,995 --> 00:28:27,329
It's gonna be okay.

360
00:28:31,334 --> 00:28:32,418
- You're so sweet.

361
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:34,211
- It's gonna be okay.

362
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:42,177
- I don't know
what to do.

363
00:28:42,178 --> 00:28:44,555
- Just be with me.

364
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:45,723
- I know.

365
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:49,143
I am.

366
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:55,107
You want to fly?

367
00:28:55,108 --> 00:28:56,191
- Yes.

368
00:28:58,361 --> 00:29:00,821
Yes.
- Yes?

369
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:02,865
You'd like that?

370
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:03,866
- Shoes off!

371
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:08,370
- Now, that I can do.

372
00:29:08,371 --> 00:29:10,038
- Grab my wrists.

373
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:12,040
- Ah-ya!

374
00:29:15,044 --> 00:29:16,962
Must have been the gaff tape.

375
00:29:16,963 --> 00:29:18,881
- What happened to your legs?

376
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:21,300
- Okay.
- Spaghetti legs.

377
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:22,676
- Okay.

Okay.

- We're going together up.

- Where are we going?

- Isn't it beautiful up here?

390
00:29:45,241 --> 00:29:46,533
- Too beautiful.

391
00:29:46,534 --> 00:29:48,368
I pissed my pants.

00:29:57,962 --> 00:29:59,838
- Who's that?

396
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:09,431
Yeah?
Yeah?

397
00:30:09,432 --> 00:30:10,599
- Delivery.

398
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:13,018
- Yeah, come on up.

399
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:15,062
Yeah, I was wrong.

400
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:16,772
- You're kidding me.

401
00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:18,440
- No.

00:30:18,441 --> 00:30:19,650
Come on.

404
00:30:20,693 --> 00:30:22,945
- Yeah.

405
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:25,030
Not again!

[bell dings]

- Hi.
Come on in.

408
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:46,969
Thank you very much.

409
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,811
What's your name?

410
00:30:55,812 --> 00:30:59,147
You've been here, like,
a thousand times,

411
00:30:59,148 --> 00:31:02,067
but I don't even know
your name.

412
00:31:02,068 --> 00:31:03,569
- Chung.

413
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:05,988
- How are you doing?

414
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:07,322
You know what's going on,

415
00:31:07,323 --> 00:31:10,367
or don't you give a shit?

416
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:17,666
Hey, kid.

417
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:19,710
Hey, you want some food?

418
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:21,628
Oh, I doubt it, huh?

419
00:31:21,629 --> 00:31:24,298
You've probably had
plenty of this stuff.

420
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:25,591
Oh.

421
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:32,681
Keep the change.

422
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:37,185

[chuckles]

424
00:31:47,655 --> 00:31:50,032
Is there anything
I can do for you?

425
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:53,911
Can I get you anything?

426
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:54,912
- Skypey.

427
00:31:56,205 --> 00:31:59,750
Skypey.

428
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:00,876
- Oh, yeah, Skype.

429
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:04,755
Yeah, I can do that for you.

430
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:06,757
I just got to get my computer.

431
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:16,934
Okay.

432
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:24,107
Okay, you just go ahead.

433
00:32:28,071 --> 00:32:29,071
It's just...

434
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:31,073
You know how to do it, right?

435
00:32:33,868 --> 00:32:35,619
Just-

436
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:36,912
yeah, there you go.

437
00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:42,292

438
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:43,377
Come and get it.

439
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:44,419
- Is it ready?

440
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:45,462
- Well, yeah.

00:33:32,635 --> 00:33:35,053
That's Vietnam he's calling.

[computerized bubble pops]

449
00:35:04,894 --> 00:35:06,853
- Chung?

450
00:35:08,189 --> 00:35:10,065
Thank you.

451
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:11,942
I'm so glad I've known you.

452
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:14,861
Chung.

453
00:35:14,862 --> 00:35:16,530
Thank you.

454
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:39,094
- We human beings are the-

455
00:35:39,095 --> 00:35:43,598
almost like
a creator of the world

456
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:45,267
or the controller of the world.

457
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:47,227
Through technology,
through science,

458
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:51,356
we can do anything, everything.

459
00:35:51,357 --> 00:35:55,861
We do not run nature.

460
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:58,780
I think we human beings
something above nature.

461
00:35:58,781 --> 00:36:00,407
I think that's wrong.

462
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:03,201
After all, we are part
of the nature.

463
00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:07,622
Uh, so through that way,

464
00:36:07,623 --> 00:36:11,585
it become clear, you see,
we have the responsibility

465
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:13,753
to take care
of the environment,

466
00:36:13,754 --> 00:36:15,213
of the nature,

467
00:36:15,214 --> 00:36:17,883
because ultimately,
we are part of the nature.

468
00:36:17,884 --> 00:36:20,677
So the nature balance
dramatically change,

469
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:21,970
we will suffer,

470
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:23,471
the entire humanity.

471
00:36:23,472 --> 00:36:25,390
Then, this will,

472
00:36:25,391 --> 00:36:27,142
what-what were instinct
will disappear.

473
00:36:27,143 --> 00:36:29,978
So that's either one,
one force.

474
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:32,814
Then another, I think,
I think,

475
00:36:32,815 --> 00:36:37,694
every human...requirement
or meaningful life,

476
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:39,196
we need to seek internal,

477
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:42,282
sort of inner
spiritual development.

478
00:36:42,283 --> 00:36:45,243
Now, here, when l say
it's a spiritual-spirituality,

479
00:36:45,244 --> 00:36:47,370
not necessarily
religious faith.

480
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:50,040
But even without
religious faith,

481
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:54,502
still there are such-

482
00:36:54,503 --> 00:36:56,254
a sense of caring
one another,

483
00:36:56,255 --> 00:36:57,672
sense of sharing one another.

484
00:36:57,673 --> 00:36:59,257
There's a sense of community.

485
00:36:59,258 --> 00:37:02,052
These are the basic
human good qualities.

486
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:05,013
These are
our fabled spirituality.

487
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:08,099
Without that,
you can't be happy person.

488
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:12,812
- One says that money
is the source of all evil.

489
00:37:12,813 --> 00:37:13,855
Is that true?

490
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:15,357
- Yes.

491
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:17,692
- No
- Yes.

492
00:37:17,693 --> 00:37:23,156
- Of course, if we, uh,
just become slave to money...

493
00:37:23,157 --> 00:37:24,491
- Eh.

494
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:28,703
- Then all our energy
or mind, this is-

495
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:31,039
concentrate on money.

496
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:34,334
And then, uh, the greed,

497
00:37:34,335 --> 00:37:35,877

We were walking home
from this meeting,

and I see the light on, right?

00:54:33,603 --> 00:54:36,355
And I'm like, "I wonder
if these guys are still here."

00:54:36,356 --> 00:54:38,232
Haven't thought of them
in fucking years, man.

00:54:38,233 --> 00:54:39,275
This used to be my family.

This was like, you know,
my brother,

868

I saw the lights on.

870
00:54:43,613 --> 00:54:44,655
So I ring the buzzer,

871
00:54:44,656 --> 00:54:46,073
and Javi answers
the fucking door,

872
00:54:46,074 --> 00:54:47,366
and they're right
in the chairs

00:54:47,367 --> 00:54:48,826
where I fucking left them,
you know?

874
00:54:48,827 --> 00:54:51,829
And so come to be
of service over there,

875
00:54:51,830 --> 00:54:53,080

whatever.

If some idiot comes in
and needs another idiot,

878
00:54:56,167 --> 00:54:57,251
I figured I'd be here.

879
00:54:57,252 --> 00:54:58,502
And who walks in?

880
00:54:58,503 --> 00:54:59,586
- You're that idiot.

881
00:54:59,587 --> 00:55:01,422
