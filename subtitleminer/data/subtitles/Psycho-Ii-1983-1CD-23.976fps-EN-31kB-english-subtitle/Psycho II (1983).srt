1
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:25,900
Oh! No!

2
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,700
No, no!

3
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:42,000
Mother! Oh, God, Mother!

4
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:44,100
Blood! Blood!

5
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:13,700
<i>Are you stating, Counsel,</i>

6
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:16,200
<i>you're not gonna offer any
contradictory psychiatric testimony?</i>

7
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,100
<i>Yes, Your Honor.</i>

8
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,300
On the basis
of this staff report,

9
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:22,900
Norman Bates is judged
restored to sanity

10
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,300
and is ordered released
forthwith.

11
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,400
What about his victims?

12
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,700
Don't they have any say?
Can you restore them?

13
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,700
Madam, please sit down.

14
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,100
This matter
is being represented

15
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,200
by the District Attorney.

16
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,900
Your Honor, my name
is Mrs. Lila Loomis.

17
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:41,700
I have a petition here
signed by 743 people

18
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,400
against Norman Bates' release,

19
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,900
including the relatives

20
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,600
of the seven people
he murdered.

21
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,500
Doesn't that give me
the right to speak out?

22
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,700
Has the District Attorney
advised Mrs. Loomis

23
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,100
about her rights
in this matter?

24
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Yes, Your Honor.

25
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,400
I explained that her petition

26
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,800
had no effect
on these proceedings.

27
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,800
Did you explain to her
that this hearing...

28
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,400
Why are you people
just sitting here?

29
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,900
Don't you realize they're going
to release a homicidal maniac?

30
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:04,200
I must ask you to sit down
or I'll have the bailiff

31
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,500
remove you
from this courtroom.

32
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,900
If you've
any further questions,

33
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,900
please discuss them
with the District Attorney

34
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,000
after this hearing.

35
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,300
Why bother?

36
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,700
It's all too obvious,

37
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,400
our courts
protect the criminals,

38
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,900
not their victims.

39
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:20,900
Congratulations, Norman.

40
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,800
Turning now
to calendar number 71143.

41
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,100
Is that all there is
to it?

42
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,900
That's all there is
to it. Let's go.

43
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,200
Let the record reflect

44
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,100
that the defendant
is present with counsel.

45
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,900
Just like I said,
they let him go.

46
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,600
I'll call you later.

47
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,900
Are you satisfied,
Doctor?

48
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:40,100
Turning a murderer loose
on an innocent public?

49
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,400
Mrs. Loomis, Norman was
not convicted of murder.

50
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,400
He was found "not guilty"
by reason of insanity.

51
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,500
And since he is
no longer...

52
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,300
That is just
legal hocus-pocus

53
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,400
and when he
murders again,

54
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,700
you will be
directly responsible.

55
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,100
Well, this belongs
to Mr. Toomey

56
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,100
who runs the motel.

57
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,900
Want me to find him?
I'll introduce you.

58
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,900
No, no. It'll... lt'll wait.

59
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,800
What's the matter?

60
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,900
Uh, I saw someone.

61
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,700
Where?

62
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,500
L-ln that window.

63
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,300
They haven't had a tenant
in the house for years.

64
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:59,900
I guess
I'm just nervous.

65
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:04,300
Well, that's understandable
under the circumstances.

66
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,100
Yeah.

67
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:25,200
Well, this is it.

68
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,500
Yeah.

69
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,000
You don't have to
stay here, you know.

70
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:32,200
I could find you
a place in town.

71
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:35,000
No, no.
L... I want to stay here.

72
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,400
Then as long
as you realize

73
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:42,800
that the memories are
more likely to reoccur here...

74
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:46,000
But you know how to handle
that now, don't you?

75
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,100
Sure.

76
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,000
You start work at noon today.
Don't forget.

77
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,400
No, I won't.

78
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,400
I don't suppose you will.

79
00:07:58,700 --> 00:07:59,900
What's wrong?

80
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,000
Oh, nothing, really.

81
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,300
I just wish there hadn't been
all those cutbacks,

82
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,700
there'd be
a trained social worker

83
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,700
looking in on you
from time to time.

84
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,200
Well, I have you,
don't I?

85
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,800
Damn right you do.

86
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,600
I had the phone
reconnected.

87
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,300
Any trouble, use it.

88
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,600
Okay.

89
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,900
Thanks, Doctor,
for everything.

90
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:19,900
Mother?

91
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,100
<i>Norman.</i>

92
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:36,700
<i>Norman, what did you put
in my tea?</i>

93
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:41,100
<i>I'm gonna get you
for this, Norman.</i>

94
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:44,200
<i>I'm gonna show you
what happens</i>

95
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:48,300
<i>to bad little boys
who poison their mothers.</i>

96
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:53,000
<i>I'm going to kill you!</i>

97
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,700
Can I help you?

98
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,000
I'm Norman. Norman Bates.

99
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,600
The new cook's helper.

100
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,400
Oh, yes.
Doctor what's-his-name

101
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,700
called about you.
Raymond.

102
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,100
I'm the one
who urged Mr. Statler

103
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,200
to give you the job.

104
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,600
I think
it's very Christian

105
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,100
to forgive and forget,
don't you?

106
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I sure do.

107
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:56,800
So do I. Myrna.
This is Norman Bates.

108
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,400
That's Myrna, Norman.

109
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,300
Come on, I'll introduce you
to Mr. Statler.

110
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,600
He's in the back.

111
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,800
Ralph, this is Norman Bates.

112
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:07,000
You have to tell me what.
Just give me...

113
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:09,800
Ralph, this is Norman Bates,
your new helper.

114
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,500
Hi. Get him an apron,
will you, Mrs. Spool?

115
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,800
Scott, we have to talk
about it sometime.

116
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,400
Step on it, would you, girl?

117
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,700
You're being paid to wait on
tables, not gab on the phone.

118
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,700
Look, I'll call you
back later. We'll talk then.

119
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,100
We're getting ready
for rush hour.

120
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:24,300
He's really very nice
once he catches his breath.

121
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:26,700
Hey, Queen for a Day,
wanna try being a waitress?

122
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,600
Mary, this is Norman.

123
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,700
He's gonna be working
back here.

124
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:31,700
Hi.

125
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,300
Boyfriend troubles,
poor child.

126
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:37,400
Heart of gold
but head of wood.

127
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:40,000
Let's get that apron
for you, shall we?

128
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,500
Here you go.

129
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,500
Jesus Christ, girl,

130
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,200
what have you broken
this time?

131
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,800
It wasn't her fault,
Mr. Statler.

132
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,500
It was me.
L... l... I did it.

133
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,900
Well, let her pick up
and you get back here

134
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,900
before you do
any more damage.

135
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:03,900
Thanks.

136
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,400
Here, Bates.

137
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,200
Here, put these up there under the
hot lights and read the orders off.

138
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,000
On the wheel. On the wheel.

139
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,900
Oh.

140
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:32,100
Uh, two meatloaf sandwiches and
one mashed potato with gravy.

141
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,900
And one baked potato.

142
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:38,100
Okay, go ahead, go ahead,
do it. See if I care.

143
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,100
No, no, Scott. I didn't
mean it. Listen to me.

144
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Hello?

145
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,400
Hello?

146
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,300
Bastard.

147
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,400
You all right?

148
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,000
Of course I'm all right.

149
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,200
Where you going?
Into town.

150
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,800
Will you
please leave me alone?

151
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:59,100
If you're going into town, you're
heading in the wrong direction.

152
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,300
Look, l... I don't know
what happened,

153
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,400
but, uh, why don't you
let me call you a cab?

154
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,300
Why?

155
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:12,600
Why? So you can
get home safely.

156
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:15,700
I don't have a home.

157
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,200
No home?

158
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,500
I've been living with my
boyfriend for over a year.

159
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,400
And all of a sudden,
he tells me we're through.

160
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:25,100
And then I just phoned him to ask
him why and he wouldn't tell me.

161
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:28,500
All he'd say is that I couldn't
come back to our apartment.

162
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,500
Well, what're you...
What... What're you gonna do?

163
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:32,100
Call a friend in town,
I guess.

164
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,500
See if somebody'll let me
crash with them for the night.

165
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,500
What about your parents?

166
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,800
Uh, couldn't you
stay with them?

167
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,400
They're in Portland.

168
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,400
And they don't care
what happens to me, anyway.

169
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:45,200
Oh, uh, I own a motel
not too far from here.

170
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,300
And you'd be welcome
to spend the night

171
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,200
in one of the empty rooms
if you'd like.

172
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,400
F-FOC, of course.

173
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,200
What?

174
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,900
Free of charge.

175
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,200
Oh.

176
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:00,500
But no, that's very nice of
you but I don't wanna impose.

177
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,400
You wouldn't be imposing.

178
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:05,700
Co-workers ought to help each
other out, don't you think?

179
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:09,600
You know what, you covered for me
today when I broke that pie plate.

180
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:10,900
Yeah.

181
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:13,700
I figured you'd get into more
trouble for it than I would.

182
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,800
You're not kidding.

183
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:18,600
I've been working there four days and
I've broken a dozen dishes already.

184
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,100
You sure it's all right
if I stay at your motel?

185
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,300
Absolutely.

186
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:26,400
Come on, let's get going.
It looks like rain.

187
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,900
Well, we almost made it.

188
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,200
You didn't get
too wet, did you?

189
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:48,300
No, I'm all right.

190
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:49,300
Oh.

191
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:50,700
Do you own all this?

192
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:53,600
Oh, yeah.
Well, it isn't much,

193
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,900
but I'll get it
fixed up eventually.

194
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:58,500
Well, let me
get you a room key.

195
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,000
Mr. Toomey.

196
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:22,200
Why don't you wait here
while I check the room?

197
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,900
Uh, just to make sure
the linen's fresh.

198
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,400
What you thinking about
stealing something?

199
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:48,100
There's no reason to be scared,
sweetheart. I manage this dump.

200
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,800
What do you want, a room?

201
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,600
Norman's already
getting me one, thank you.

202
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,000
You're with Bates?

203
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,800
Well, uh, you must be
Norman Bates.

204
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,700
I'm Warren Toomey.

205
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:08,100
Mary, why don't you
go up to the house?

206
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,200
The... The front door
is open.

207
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,000
Is something wrong
with the room?

208
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:15,700
No. Just... Just... Just... Just...
Just go up and wait for me, okay?

209
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,600
Look,
it doesn't matter...

210
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,600
Look, just do
as I say, okay?

211
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:26,300
She's pretty cute.
Where'd you find her?

212
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,000
What's this stuff?

213
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,800
I'd say it was drugs.

214
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,000
What about
the occupied cabins?

215
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:37,000
Is that what's going on
in there, too?

216
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,200
Yeah.

217
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,400
Boy, this town.

218
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,400
If it isn't the parents,
it's the kids.

219
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,400
I caught a couple of them
screwin' in the basement

220
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,000
of your house up there
last week.

221
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,500
Of course,
I threw them right out.

222
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,400
Can you believe that?

223
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:51,300
What kind of a motel
are you running here?

224
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,200
The kind that makes money.

225
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,500
People come here to party.

226
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,500
They stay a few hours
and then they leave.

227
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,500
What more can you ask from a motel
so far from the beaten track, huh?

228
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,900
You're fired.

229
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,700
Hey, you can't fire me.

230
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,300
I was hired by the hospital.

231
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:14,400
This State has no claim on me
or my property anymore.

232
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,600
And neither do you.

233
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,400
I want you
out of here tomorrow.

234
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:20,900
Yeah, well, why don't you try
putting me out, Mr. Whacko, hmm?

235
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,100
I'd like to see that.

236
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,400
I won't have to.
I'll just go to the police.

237
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,800
I'm sure they'd be very
interested in what's going on here,

238
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,600
especially the drugs.

239
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,600
Tomorrow, Mr. Toomey.

240
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:35,200
And don't rent out any more
rooms in this motel. No more.

241
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:44,200
At least my customers
have a good time.

242
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:46,100
What'd yours get,
Bates, huh?

243
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,400
Dead, that's what
they got!

244
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,900
Dead! Murdered by you,
you loony!

245
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,700
Hi!

246
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,300
What was all
the yelling about?

247
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:04,400
Oh.

248
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:08,200
My motel manager
and I just had a fight.

249
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:11,100
Wasn't because of me,
was it?

250
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,100
No.

251
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,800
Why are you sitting
in the dark?

252
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:18,900
I was just thinking
about Scott.

253
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,800
Maybe if I hadn't
blown up at him so quick,

254
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,100
we would've
worked things out.

255
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:26,600
Yeah, maybe.
L... I don't know.

256
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,700
Is that, uh, better?

257
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,200
Do you think I should call
him and talk to him again?

258
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,600
Oh, sure.

259
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,000
Hi, Scott?

260
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,300
Are you all right?

261
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,200
What were you talking about?

262
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:06,700
Listen, I didn't mean it.

263
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,700
Are you still
mad at me?

264
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,900
Yeah, I'm fine.

265
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,600
I'm at this motel.

266
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,100
No, I didn't get wet.

267
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,200
I got here just
before the storm started.

268
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,300
Look, I can take care
of myself.

269
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,300
No, of course not.

270
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,400
Look, I can't talk any longer.
I got to go.

271
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,800
Uh, oh.

272
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,800
How did it go?

273
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,900
Terrible. I found out why he
didn't want me to come home tonight.

274
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,200
Oh, well, why?

275
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,400
He's got somebody new.

276
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,300
He's moved her in
already.

277
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,400
Well, that's no good.

278
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:05,100
Oh, well.

279
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,900
Think how it would've been if
I'd married him and then found out

280
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,800
what sort of guy he was.

281
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,900
He asked me to, you know?

282
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:14,100
Sure. L... I mean,
I'm sure he did.

283
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:17,200
Oh, uh, have... have...
have you had dinner yet?

284
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,100
No.

285
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:19,800
Well, let... let's have it
together.

286
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,500
I was just about to
sit down.

287
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,600
It's just, uh,
sandwiches and milk,

288
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,800
but you're more than welcome to share it.

289
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:26,900
I really
don't think that...

290
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,500
No, no, no, do it. Do it... Do
it for my sake. Starving yourself

291
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,800
isn't going to make
anything any better, either.

292
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,200
All right.

293
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,200
But this is yours.

294
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:39,500
No, go ahead, you... you
have it. I'll make another.

295
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,200
Do you have a knife?

296
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,700
No, I'm afraid I don't.

297
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:49,200
L... I just moved back here
after being many years away.

298
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:52,600
I forgot to bring
any cu-cutlery.

299
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:54,700
That's odd.

300
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,300
People usually
leave something,

301
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:58,500
even if it is only
an old butter knife.

302
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,600
Oh, there.

303
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,100
Is something wrong, Norman?

304
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,400
Um,

305
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:31,800
aren't you going to eat?

306
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:35,000
No. L... l... l... I just
suddenly lost my appetite,

307
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,600
but you... you... you
go ahead.

308
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,800
Enjoy it.

309
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,700
I guess I'm like you. L... I
suddenly lost my appetite, too.

310
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,700
Oh, w-w-would you like
something else?

311
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,100
There're cookies for dessert.

312
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:55,100
Oh, no, no, th-thank you.

313
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,700
Uh, can I use
your phone again?

314
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:57,800
Sure.

315
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,000
Who you gonna call?

316
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,100
Um, I just remembered this
girlfriend I have in town.

317
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:04,200
L... I mean, she's kind of
a girlfriend, and, uh,

318
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:06,600
maybe she'd let me
spend the night with her.

319
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,600
Well, huh, I thought
you were gonna stay here.

320
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,200
There's a spare room
upstairs

321
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,500
and you're
more than welcome to it.

322
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,900
Uh, l... I don't think
that's such a good idea.

323
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,100
Why?

324
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:22,000
I don't mean to hurt
your feelings or anything,

325
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,800
but Myrna was talking about
you at the diner today.

326
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:27,400
Mrs. Spool kept on telling
her to shush but she wouldn't.

327
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,400
She said you'd been
locked up.

328
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:35,500
Did she say why?
Well, I'll tell you.

329
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:39,800
When I was 12,
my mother went mad,

330
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:43,100
so I put some poison
in her tea.

331
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,600
You know? Just...

332
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,700
I'm all right now.

333
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:48,600
You sure?

334
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,600
Sure.

335
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:53,000
Otherwise they wouldn't have given
me a job in a diner, would they?

336
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:55,500
I don't know.
It takes a nut to work there.

337
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:59,100
Oh, boy!

338
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:02,800
Look, I-I-I'm sorry,
but I don't want to...

339
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:06,500
What if I told you
that I needed you to stay?

340
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,100
Why would you need me?

341
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:10,600
Because this is
the first night

342
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:13,900
I've spent in this house
in years, much less alone.

343
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,400
A lot of my troubles

344
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,300
had to do
with this house.

345
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:22,800
So you see, I'm as scared as you
are, just for different reasons.

346
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,200
I-I'm sorry,
but l... l...

347
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:26,300
Please.

348
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,100
That bad, huh?

349
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,700
No. Not... Not... Not that one.

350
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,700
This one over there.

351
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,600
What's wrong
with this one?

352
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:54,800
Well, that, uh, used
to belong to my mother.

353
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,900
But she's dead,
isn't she?

354
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,500
Yeah.

355
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,900
Is this the room where
you had your troubles?

356
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,400
One of them, yeah.

357
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,800
Well, I don't know what
happened to you in the past,

358
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:08,200
but you're never gonna get
over it, not unless you face it.

359
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:20,800
See? No ghosts.

360
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,300
No.

361
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,900
I could sleep here.

362
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:30,800
No, I'd, uh...

363
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,200
Why not?

364
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,200
I'd just rather
you didn't.

365
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:38,300
What happened in here
that scared you so?

366
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,900
Let me show you the room
across the hall, okay?

367
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:57,100
You'll be, uh,
just fine in here.

368
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,400
Well, the, uh...

369
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,700
The bathroom?

370
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:02,600
L-ls, uh,
right over there.

371
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,800
Uh, well,

372
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,100
I guess it's time to, uh,
to go to sleep.

373
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:10,000
Okay.

374
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,100
Good night, Mary.

375
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:25,500
About time, girl.

376
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,500
Sorry.

377
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:27,700
Hi.
Hi.

378
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:30,400
I'm sorry I missed you
this morning.

379
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,100
I got up early and went into
town to see my girlfriend.

380
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:35,700
You know, the one
I was telling you about.

381
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:37,500
Guess what?

382
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,600
What?

383
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,800
We're going to
room together.

384
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:44,100
Well, y-y-y-you... you're more than
welcome to stay with me, you know.

385
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:46,500
Thanks, but I'd really
rather live in town.

386
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,200
Oh, in town, yeah.

387
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:51,300
Uh, my... my place is
a lot closer to work.

388
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:54,300
No, l... I really don't think
that's a good idea.

389
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,300
Okay. Well,
if you change your mind.

390
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:59,300
Hey, girl, I gave you the
morning off, not the afternoon.

391
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:00,300
Hop to it.

392
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:01,800
Charming, isn't he?

393
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:06,100
Chop up some more lettuce,
will you, Norman?

394
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:27,800
Hey, Ralph, so, uh, how's
your new helper doing?

395
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,300
Hi, Warren.
Just fine, thanks.

396
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:35,700
Yeah, well, I hope he washes
dishes better than he runs a motel.

397
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:58,200
Hey, can I get a little service
around here or what, huh?

398
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,200
Okay.

399
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:01,200
Hey, cutie! Come here.

400
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,500
Oh, hello,
what would you like?

401
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:07,900
I'd like some of what
Norman got last night.

402
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,800
Pardon?

403
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:12,800
You heard me, sweetheart.

404
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:16,100
Why don't you look at a
menu and I'll be right back?

405
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,800
What happened between you
and that man last night?

406
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:21,700
I fired him.

407
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:24,200
Oh, great,
he's on my station.

408
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,000
What did he say?

409
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,900
Nothing nice and I
think he's been drinking.

410
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:29,700
He sure smells like it.

411
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:31,700
Hey, you do have
other tables, honey,

412
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:33,900
or do you want me to
wait on those, too?

413
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:36,400
Talk about the customers
being nasty.

414
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,800
Excuse me,
do you still work here?

415
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:41,800
Yeah.

416
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:44,100
Then can I please
have my orders?

417
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:10,700
What was it like?

418
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,400
What's what like?

419
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,200
Screwin' a psycho?

420
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,700
Would you mind
removing your foot?

421
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,500
Next.

422
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:25,200
Two turkey sandwiches
on whole wheat toast.

423
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,700
One BLT, hold the mayo.

424
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:29,200
I'll get the tomatoes,
Mr. Statler.

425
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:35,000
Hey, I suppose
you didn't spend last night

426
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:36,500
alone with him
in that house, huh?

427
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:39,000
You got strange tastes
in men, honey.

428
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:41,500
Just because two people
sleep under the same roof

429
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:43,600
doesn't necessarily mean
they've made love.

430
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,000
Since when, huh?

431
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Or are you the kind that
doesn't, uh, kiss and tell?

432
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:53,400
You really want to know
what Norman's like?

433
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,500
Yeah.

434
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,200
Better than
you'll ever be, fat boy.

435
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:05,000
Cut it out, Toomey!

436
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Norman?

437
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,800
Are you talkin'
to me, whacko?

438
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:09,100
Come on.

439
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:14,300
Come on. Come on! Huh?

440
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:15,600
What's wrong?

441
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,500
Oh. Oh, that's... that's beautiful.
Go on, psycho, pick it up.

442
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,200
Come on, pick it up!

443
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,400
What's the matter,
you lose your nerve, huh?

444
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,400
Or do you only
attack women, huh?

445
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,700
Go on, pick it up!

446
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:33,400
Show us what
you're really like.

447
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,400
Come... Come on, loony.

448
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:44,500
Oh, look, not only is he
crazy, he's chicken shit, too.

449
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:48,900
What's the trouble, Warren?

450
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:51,400
The trouble is
that psycho you hired.

451
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:55,700
This is the last time
I eat here.

452
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,800
You're sweating all over.

453
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:03,100
Can I get you
something?

454
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:04,300
A glass of water, maybe?

455
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:05,200
No.

456
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:07,100
What the hell did you
do out there?

457
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:08,700
That man, Mr. Toomey,
he was trying...

458
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,000
I'm not talkin'
to you, girl.

459
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Well?

460
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,000
He was bothering Mary, and
then he slipped me a note.

461
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,100
What note?

462
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:18,000
It's there on the wheel.

463
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,800
There's nothing here.

464
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:33,200
Look, Norman, you're tired.

465
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:35,400
Why don't you take the
rest of the afternoon off?

466
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:37,300
I'm telling you,
it was right there.

467
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,900
Sure it was.

468
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,200
Don't humor me.

469
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,100
I'm telling you there
was a note on that wheel

470
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,500
from my dead mother.

471
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:03,800
Okay, everybody,
business as usual.

472
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,400
Hi.

473
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:26,100
Is that offer to room
with you still open?

474
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,900
Oh, sure.

475
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,200
Great.

476
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,900
Well, w-what happened?

477
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:32,100
Oh,

478
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,900
you know my girlfriend,
the one I told you about?

479
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:36,300
Yeah.
Well,

480
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:39,000
her boyfriend sleeps over
almost every night.

481
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:42,000
Do you know what it's like trying
to sleep in a one-room apartment

482
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:45,100
when a couple's making love
five feet from you?

483
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,300
Noisy?

484
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:49,100
You're not kidding.

485
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,900
Well, I thought you were
wonderful today.

486
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Why?

487
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,500
The way you handled
that Toomey guy.

488
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:55,800
What an asshole.

489
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:57,900
I could've killed him
and you were so cool.

490
00:32:57,900 --> 00:33:00,400
No, I don't kill
people anymore, remember?

491
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:03,400
Oh, here.

492
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,000
What's this?
Fudge.

493
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,100
My grandmother sent it to
me. She makes great fudge.

494
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:12,900
Well, thank you.

495
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,400
What about that note?
You figure out who sent it?

496
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:19,600
That was just
a practical joke.

497
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:21,700
Yeah, I guess so.

498
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,400
Oh, oh, oh, l-let me
take that.

499
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,300
No, no, no, that's all right. I can manage.

500
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:26,200
Uh...

501
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:28,100
Did you... Did you
have dinner yet?

502
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:29,000
Yes.

503
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:32,200
And I'm exhausted. I'm going to
bed right after I take a shower.

504
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
If that's all right
with you.

505
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,600
Oh, oh, sure.

506
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:10,400
Hey, wake up!

507
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,900
Hey, you nut guys there?

508
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,200
Hey!

509
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:19,600
Psycho!
Hey, hello, psycho!

510
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:22,700
I just want you to know
I'm moving out! Huh?

511
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,100
Hello?

512
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:45,500
W-What? Who is this?

513
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:51,000
My mother is dead.

514
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:57,700
Mr. Toomey, if this is you,
you're sicker than I ever was.

515
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,000
Bastard.

516
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,000
Bill!

517
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:15,100
Hi, Bill. I wasn't
expecting you till tomorrow.

518
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:17,900
Hi, Norman.

519
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,300
I got a call
from Mr. Statler.

520
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:21,100
He said you quit your job
at the diner.

521
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:24,300
Yeah. Well, I just figured I could
make more money with the motel.

522
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:28,000
You know, once I get... once I
get it back into condition that is.

523
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:30,100
What does Mr. Toomey think
about your plans?

524
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:32,100
Him? You know,
I fired him.

525
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,900
Y-Y-You know,
he was turning this place

526
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:37,000
into what I think
they call an "adult motel."

527
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,000
Oh, I see.

528
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:44,200
Well, there've been an awful lot of
changes in the week you've been back.

529
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:45,400
Yeah, yeah.

530
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,800
Any more notes
or phone calls?

531
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:49,300
Oh, no, no, no.

532
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:50,900
Who's that?

533
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:51,900
Where?

534
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:53,900
There, in the top window?

535
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:55,300
In the attic?

536
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,300
It looked like a woman.

537
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:59,200
Oh, oh, oh,
that must've been Mary.

538
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,200
Mary, who?

539
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:02,600
Oh, Mary. She works with me
at the diner.

540
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:06,000
She's been staying here, too.

541
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:07,200
Hmm?

542
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:09,800
Oh, it's nothing like that.
We're just, uh,

543
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:11,500
we're just friends.

544
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:59,800
Mary.

545
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:12,700
Hi, Mary. You look great.

546
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:15,200
Look, this is, uh,
this is Dr. Raymond.

547
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,700
He was my psychiatrist
in the institution.

548
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:20,900
Hello.
Hi.

549
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:22,700
Well, what do you think?

550
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:23,700
About what?

551
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:26,600
What Norman's doing. Has he
told you his plans for the place?

552
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:28,100
Some of them.

553
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:30,600
Well, I have to be going
to work.

554
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:32,400
Can I give you a lift?

555
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:34,200
Go ahead.

556
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,000
See you tonight.

557
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:03,500
So, what can I do
for you, Doctor?

558
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:06,200
Oh, thank you.

559
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,300
Are you familiar
with the Norman Bates case?

560
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:11,900
Very. I was deputy here

561
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:15,000
when Sheriff Chambers
arrested him years ago.

562
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,800
I re-read the file when I
found out he'd been released.

563
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:19,100
So, what's the trouble?

564
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,700
Bates dressing up
as his mother again?

565
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:23,200
No, nothing like that.

566
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:26,200
Although, Norman says that
somebody has been leaving notes

567
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:28,800
and making phone calls
claiming to be his mother.

568
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:31,500
Well, people. So, what do
you want me to do about it?

569
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:32,800
Put a tap on his phone.

570
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,600
Sorry, Doc,
I can't do that.

571
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:37,300
This is Fairvale, California,
not Washington, DC.

572
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:41,300
But I can check around and see who might
hate Norman enough to do something like that.

573
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:42,400
Anything else?

574
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:43,900
You could keep
an eye on Norman.

575
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:45,500
I have been.

576
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:50,000
All right, Sheriff,
here's my card,

577
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:52,100
in case you should need me.

578
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,500
Oh, there is
one other thing.

579
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,400
Why, of course, what?

580
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:57,200
He's got a girl
living with him.

581
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:59,100
Uh, Mary Samuels.

582
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:01,300
She works at the diner.

583
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:02,900
Then I'll check on her, too.

584
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,100
Thank you, Sheriff.

585
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:05,400
Any time.

586
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:55,500
Slut?

587
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:16,800
Are you sure
this is safe?

588
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:18,700
It always has been.

589
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:21,800
Come on.

590
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,900
Oh, I don't need
any more.

591
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:31,400
What's that?

592
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:32,600
What?

593
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:34,900
That sound
in the next room.

594
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:37,200
You're just stoned.

595
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:42,100
I'm not.

596
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:57,600
Jesus.

597
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,100
What is it?

598
00:48:59,100 --> 00:49:00,100
Shh.

599
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,900
Let's get out of here.

600
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:17,100
Shh.

601
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,400
Come on, hurry!

602
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:32,900
Come on!

603
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:35,800
Look out, behind you!

604
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:03,000
Norman?

605
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:05,400
Norman?

606
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:07,000
Norman?

607
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:10,100
Mary, up here.

608
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:15,800
What are you doing
up here?

609
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:17,900
L... I was locked in.

610
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:22,400
You couldn't have been.
There's no key in the lock.

611
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:25,600
Someone unlocked it
while I was asleep.

612
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:27,500
Who?

613
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:30,100
Whoever's been pretending
to be my mother.

614
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:32,100
Norman, what are you
talking about?

615
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:33,500
I saw her in the window.

616
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:34,500
And just look
in the room.

617
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:36,600
It's all been fixed up
and her stuff's inside.

618
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:38,300
There's another note, too.

619
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:39,800
I'm going to check
the back stairs,

620
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:41,600
maybe they went down
that way.

621
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:44,600
Norman?

622
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:45,700
What?

623
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:47,900
There's no note in there.

624
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:51,600
What do you mean
it's not there?

625
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:57,800
No, th-this isn't
how it was.

626
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:00,600
It was all fixed up.

627
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:03,000
It wasn't like this.

628
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:06,900
The... The note.

629
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,600
This...
The dresses are...

630
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:14,900
Who's that?

631
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:19,900
Norman, you better
answer the door.

632
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,000
Yeah.

633
00:51:31,100 --> 00:51:32,100
Norman,

634
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:35,700
whatever you do, don't
tell them about the bedroom.

635
00:51:38,100 --> 00:51:39,300
Hello, Norman,
Well?

636
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:41,700
I'm Sheriff Hunt.
How are you?

637
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:43,200
This is Deputy Pool.

638
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:45,200
Can we come in?

639
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:46,700
Sure, yes. Yes.

640
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:48,400
Uh, this is...

641
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:50,000
I know. Mary Samuels.

642
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:54,300
What can we do for you?

643
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:56,600
There hasn't been
any trouble, has there?

644
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:58,100
Yes, there has.

645
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:00,600
What sort?

646
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:02,300
The old sort.

647
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:05,300
There's a girl sitting down
in my squad car below.

648
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:06,700
Too scared to come
into this house.

649
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:07,600
Why?

650
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:09,500
She claims that
she saw her boyfriend

651
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:11,200
murdered in your
fruit cellar today

652
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:13,600
by a large woman
dressed in black.

653
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:16,400
That's just how
your mother used to look,

654
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:18,000
isn't it, Norman?

655
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
Well, what...
what were they doing

656
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:21,400
in the cellar, anyway?

657
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:23,200
Oh, what kids do today,
I guess.

658
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:25,400
Smoking dope,
messin' around.

659
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:28,600
Do you know anything
about that, Norman?

660
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:30,600
No.

661
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:34,700
Do you mind if we look
in the fruit cellar?

662
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:37,000
No.

663
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:50,200
Looks clean to me.

664
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:51,900
Yeah, doesn't it?

665
00:53:00,700 --> 00:53:02,800
You've been straightening up
down here?

666
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:04,000
No, sir.

667
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:06,100
This is the first time
I've been inside this room

668
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:07,800
s-s-since I came home.

669
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:12,100
Then who did it?

670
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:13,300
I did.

671
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:14,900
Several days ago.

672
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,600
Hey, Norman?

673
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:20,200
I just hate a dirty house,
don't you?

674
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:25,700
Why is this open?

675
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:27,700
I don't know.

676
00:53:28,300 --> 00:53:29,500
You better put a padlock
on it

677
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:31,600
before someone
robs you blind.

678
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:39,200
You know why Norman doesn't
come down here, don't you?

679
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:40,600
No, I don't.

680
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:44,300
He used to keep
his mother's corpse down here.

681
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:46,200
Stole it from the grave.

682
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:49,100
Talked to himself
in her voice,

683
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:50,700
answering in his own.

684
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:52,500
What do you think of that?

685
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:53,700
It's horrible.

686
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:55,700
That's right, it was.

687
00:53:56,100 --> 00:53:58,000
Now, let me ask you again.

688
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:01,300
Are you positive
you cleaned up down here?

689
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:03,900
Yes.

690
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:07,000
All right.

691
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:09,500
Mike?

692
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:10,500
Yeah?

693
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:11,700
Let's go.

694
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:18,900
Are you sure
that neither one of you

695
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:21,500
heard anything this afternoon
between 4:00 and 5:00?

696
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:22,500
I don't know.
But I was...

697
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:23,800
He was with me
all afternoon.

698
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:25,900
We were walking
in the fields.

699
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:28,800
Goodbye.

700
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:31,500
Nice to see you again,
Norman.

701
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:39,600
Why did you do that?

702
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:40,600
Do what?

703
00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:41,800
Lie to the Sheriff?

704
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:43,300
You weren't with me
this afternoon.

705
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:44,200
I had to do something.

706
00:54:44,300 --> 00:54:46,200
He was going to arrest you.

707
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,000
Norman.

708
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:55,300
It's starting again.

709
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:03,600
Sheriff Hunt?

710
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:04,600
Yes.

711
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:06,200
I-I'm Lila Loomis.

712
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:08,400
I used to be Lila Crane.

713
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:12,300
Oh, yes, of course.
What a coincidence.

714
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,600
I was just thinkin'
about you and Sam.

715
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:15,500
How is he?

716
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:17,100
My husband is dead.

717
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:19,500
I'm sorry.

718
00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:22,200
Well, what brings you
back to Fairvale

719
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:23,400
after all these years?

720
00:55:23,300 --> 00:55:26,200
Norman Bates.
Where is he?

721
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:29,800
He's out at his motel,
I suppose.

722
00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:31,300
Why haven't you
arrested him?

723
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:32,300
What for?

724
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:33,700
For murder.

725
00:55:33,700 --> 00:55:36,300
It's all over town
what he did to that boy.

726
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:39,100
Mrs. Loomis, I can't arrest
a man without proof.

727
00:55:39,100 --> 00:55:41,000
Especially one
with an alibi.

728
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,300
What alibi?

729
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:45,000
There's a girl staying
out there with him

730
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,800
and she says
that he was with her

731
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:48,500
at the time
the murder took place

732
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:50,400
if there was a murder.

733
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:53,400
Oh, well, what do you mean
"if there was a murder"?

734
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:56,000
Well, what I mean is
that I am not convinced

735
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,300
that anybody was killed.

736
00:55:57,400 --> 00:55:59,800
There's no body.
No corpus delicti.

737
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:01,800
So let's just wait
and see

738
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:03,700
if the boy
comes home tonight.

739
00:56:03,700 --> 00:56:05,100
Have you dragged
the swamp yet?

740
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,000
What?

741
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,000
The swamp?

742
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,200
That's where he dumped
his victims the last time.

743
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:10,600
Have you dragged it yet?

744
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:11,700
No, ma'am.

745
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,900
Well, then I suggest
you start,

746
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,600
before there
are more murders.

747
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:16,600
Unless, of course,

748
00:56:16,700 --> 00:56:18,800
you want it
on your conscience.

749
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:25,000
What's her problem?

750
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:26,800
I don't know.

751
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:29,600
But if Norman Bates
is crazy,

752
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:31,500
there are a whole lot
of people around here

753
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:32,700
runnin' him
a close second.

754
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:38,100
Are you sure
you're all right?

755
00:56:38,100 --> 00:56:39,400
Yeah. I'm fine.

756
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:42,000
What you need is one of
my special Irish coffees.

757
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,100
Is there any brandy
in the house?

758
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:45,600
I don't know.

759
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
My mother
doesn't allow liquor.

760
00:56:49,100 --> 00:56:50,600
Mr. Toomey was a drinker,
wasn't he?

761
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:53,000
Did he leave a bottle
in the office?

762
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,800
I don't know.
I didn't look.

763
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:58,000
I'll be right back.
You rest here.

764
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:23,400
Hello?

765
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:38,000
Why did you lie
to the Sheriff

766
00:57:38,100 --> 00:57:40,000
and say Bates was with you
this afternoon?

767
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:42,400
Mother. What are you
doing here?

768
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:44,400
Go back to the hotel
before you ruin everything.

769
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:46,800
Answer my question?
Why did you alibi Bates?

770
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:48,000
I didn't alibi him.

771
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,500
Don't lie to me.
I talked to the Sheriff.

772
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,400
Why did you do it?

773
00:57:57,500 --> 00:58:00,100
Because Norman couldn't have
murdered that boy.

774
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:01,300
Why not?

775
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:07,900
He saw me in the window
like we planned,

776
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:10,700
then he went in to the room
and saw the stuff.

777
00:58:11,300 --> 00:58:12,800
Then when he went
looking for her,

778
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:14,700
I locked the attic door
behind him.

779
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:16,200
He was trapped in there
for hours

780
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:19,000
while I took everything
down the back stairs.

781
00:58:19,700 --> 00:58:22,300
So, you see,
he couldn't have done it.

782
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:25,000
What difference
does it make?

783
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:28,100
We want him re-committed.
This would have done it.

784
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,800
Mother, he's innocent.

785
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:33,300
Innocent? He killed
your aunt, didn't he?

786
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:35,500
Not to mention
the six other people.

787
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:38,300
Mother, that was 22 years ago.

788
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:41,900
Mary, people don't change.

789
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
He must have
gotten out somehow.

790
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,700
Mother, I was wrong.

791
00:58:46,300 --> 00:58:47,900
I don't think
he drilled that hole

792
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:48,800
in the bathroom wall.

793
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:50,200
Of course he did.

794
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:51,700
Mother, listen to me.

795
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,400
I think there's someone else
in the house.

796
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:55,500
Don't be stupid.

797
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:57,900
It's just Bates
up to his old tricks again.

798
00:58:57,900 --> 00:59:00,500
It can't be Norman.
He isn't like that anymore.

799
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:03,500
Maybe if you knew him now.

800
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:06,400
It's just that
he's trying so very hard

801
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:08,700
to do what's right
to keep his sanity.

802
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:10,100
And that hardly
seems fair for us

803
00:59:10,100 --> 00:59:12,000
to be doing
what we're doing to him.

804
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:14,200
You're as crazy as he is.

805
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:17,700
We'll talk later.
Norman needs me.

806
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,600
Norman needs you?

807
00:59:19,700 --> 00:59:21,900
A psychopath needs you?

808
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:25,100
Look, go back to your hotel.
We'll talk later.

809
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:27,500
He'll kill you.
You know that, don't you?

810
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:30,400
He'll murder you just like
he did all the others.

811
01:00:13,300 --> 01:00:14,300
Mary!

812
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:19,300
My God, what happened?

813
01:00:19,300 --> 01:00:20,800
I don't know.

814
01:00:27,700 --> 01:00:30,100
Jesus. How did that
get in there?

815
01:00:31,300 --> 01:00:33,700
After I killed that kid
in the cellar,

816
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:36,100
I used it
to clean up the mess

817
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:38,600
and then, then I flushed it
down there.

818
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:41,100
You didn't kill anybody.
You were locked in the attic.

819
01:00:41,100 --> 01:00:44,000
It wasn't locked.
You said so yourself.

820
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:45,300
Norman,
stop talking nonsense.

821
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:47,100
I told you,
you didn't kill anybody.

822
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,100
Then how do you
explain this?

823
01:00:49,700 --> 01:00:50,700
Well?

824
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:52,300
I can't.

825
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:57,500
Did you clean up the cellar
the way you told the Sheriff?

826
01:00:57,700 --> 01:00:58,700
No.

827
01:00:58,600 --> 01:00:59,800
Somebody did.

828
01:01:00,300 --> 01:01:03,600
And with that towel,
after they killed that kid.

829
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:06,400
Norman,
it couldn't have been you.

830
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:09,200
How can you be so sure?
Even I don't know.

831
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:10,700
I always used black out
when l...

832
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:11,900
Because you couldn't.

833
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,600
You don't have it in you,
not anymore.

834
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:21,000
Norman, look,
why don't you go downstairs

835
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:24,100
and make us a drink, okay?
And I'll clean this up.

836
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:02,400
Norman.

837
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:06,400
Yes.

838
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
Uh, the tea kettle's boiling.

839
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:13,900
Oh.

840
01:02:14,300 --> 01:02:15,300
Okay.

841
01:04:42,500 --> 01:04:43,800
What happened?

842
01:04:43,900 --> 01:04:46,500
Up there.
I saw someone staring at me.

843
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:49,400
There's no one there now.

844
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:51,300
Someone was watching me
through that hole.

845
01:04:51,300 --> 01:04:52,500
They're in the house
right now.

846
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:53,700
Where'd you get
that thing?

847
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:54,900
L... I had it
in my purse.

848
01:04:54,900 --> 01:04:56,300
My mother gave it me
when I was...

849
01:04:56,300 --> 01:04:57,300
Oh.

850
01:04:58,800 --> 01:04:59,900
Come on.

851
01:05:00,100 --> 01:05:01,100
Uh...

852
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:03,800
You take the downstairs,
I'll check up here.

853
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:05,400
Well, shouldn't we
stick together?

854
01:05:05,500 --> 01:05:07,400
Don't worry,
I've got this.

855
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:13,100
It's because of me, isn't it?
That's why you have it.

856
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:14,700
Of course not.

857
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:19,200
Hurry up,
they'll get away.

858
01:05:36,900 --> 01:05:39,100
Mrs. Lila Loomis,
Room 15, please.

859
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:44,300
You're sure
she hasn't come back?

860
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:47,700
There'll be no message,
thank you.

861
01:05:48,300 --> 01:05:50,400
Okay, Mother,
where are you?

862
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:20,700
Norman.

863
01:06:38,900 --> 01:06:40,200
What is it?

864
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:45,800
It's my mother.

865
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:48,100
She's downstairs.

866
01:06:49,100 --> 01:06:50,400
Did you see her?

867
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:55,200
You're sure you heard her?

868
01:06:55,900 --> 01:06:56,900
Come on.

869
01:06:57,200 --> 01:06:58,200
No.

870
01:06:59,100 --> 01:07:00,600
She'll kill you.

871
01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:02,500
I know she will.

872
01:07:02,900 --> 01:07:04,900
Norman, your mother's dead.

873
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:07,600
You killed her.
You told me so yourself.

874
01:07:07,700 --> 01:07:08,800
I was wrong.

875
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:11,000
She survived.

876
01:07:11,700 --> 01:07:12,800
And now,

877
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:15,000
she's downstairs,

878
01:07:15,700 --> 01:07:17,300
waiting for you.

879
01:07:17,300 --> 01:07:19,000
Norman, it couldn't
be your mother.

880
01:07:19,100 --> 01:07:20,100
No.

881
01:07:20,500 --> 01:07:22,700
No, it... it had to be
someone else.

882
01:07:22,700 --> 01:07:25,600
Whoever it is that's trying
to drive you crazy again.

883
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:26,600
Yeah?

884
01:07:26,900 --> 01:07:27,900
Yes.

885
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:29,700
So, let's go downstairs
and find...

886
01:07:29,700 --> 01:07:30,700
No!

887
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:34,500
It's too dangerous.

888
01:07:35,500 --> 01:07:37,200
Let's wait till morning.

889
01:07:37,500 --> 01:07:39,300
What are we gonna do
until then?

890
01:07:39,300 --> 01:07:40,800
I'll protect you.

891
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:43,100
You'll be okay.

892
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:46,300
I'll... I'll be fine right here.

893
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:51,600
It was always safe here

894
01:07:52,300 --> 01:07:53,500
at night.

895
01:07:56,500 --> 01:07:57,500
Norman, listen...

896
01:07:57,500 --> 01:07:58,500
No!

897
01:07:59,900 --> 01:08:01,000
Okay.

898
01:08:02,300 --> 01:08:04,300
We'll spend the night
in here.

899
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:06,700
You can
use the sleeping bag.

900
01:08:55,900 --> 01:08:57,900
What are you doing, Norman?

901
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:00,600
Norman, put the knife down.

902
01:09:00,600 --> 01:09:02,300
Nobody's gonna come
in the door.

903
01:09:02,300 --> 01:09:03,200
They're not?

904
01:09:03,300 --> 01:09:04,400
No.

905
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:07,700
Okay.

906
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:12,600
Mary.

907
01:09:13,500 --> 01:09:14,500
Yes.

908
01:09:14,500 --> 01:09:15,900
I'm becoming

909
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:18,700
confused again, aren't I?

910
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,500
Of course not.

911
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,500
Don't lie to me. Not you.

912
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:35,000
Yes, Norman, you are
becoming confused again.

913
01:09:45,500 --> 01:09:46,500
Just

914
01:09:47,900 --> 01:09:51,500
don't let them take me back
to the institution, all right?

915
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:06,400
Don't worry, Norman.
I won't.

916
01:10:09,300 --> 01:10:10,700
You smell good.

917
01:10:10,900 --> 01:10:11,900
I do?

918
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:12,900
Yeah.

919
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:15,200
What do I smell like?

920
01:10:16,500 --> 01:10:19,900
You smell like, like the
toasted cheese sandwiches...

921
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:20,800
What?

922
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:22,700
...that my mother
used to bring me

923
01:10:22,700 --> 01:10:24,900
when I was in bed
with a temperature.

924
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:27,600
She used to do lots
of nice things for me

925
01:10:27,500 --> 01:10:28,800
before she went...

926
01:10:28,900 --> 01:10:30,000
Before she became...

927
01:10:29,900 --> 01:10:30,900
Shh.

928
01:10:31,500 --> 01:10:33,700
Just remember the good things
she did for you.

929
01:10:33,700 --> 01:10:35,200
Only the good things.

930
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:38,200
I can't.
They're not there anymore.

931
01:10:38,300 --> 01:10:40,100
Of course they're there.

932
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:42,900
No, the doctors
took them all away.

933
01:10:43,500 --> 01:10:45,500
Along with everything else.

934
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:47,600
Except,

935
01:10:49,100 --> 01:10:50,700
except those sandwiches.

936
01:10:50,700 --> 01:10:52,100
Shh.

937
01:10:55,400 --> 01:10:56,700
Just sleep.

938
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:17,900
Oh, good morning, Doctor.

939
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:19,500
Good morning, Norman.

940
01:11:19,500 --> 01:11:20,500
I called your office.

941
01:11:20,500 --> 01:11:22,300
They said you were on your way
over here.

942
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:23,600
Where's Mary?

943
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:26,000
She's gone in to town.

944
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:28,300
Oh. What for?

945
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:29,500
I don't know.

946
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:31,100
She didn't tell me.

947
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:33,000
Some tea?

948
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:34,800
Coffee, if you have it.
Thank you.

949
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:36,800
Sure.

950
01:11:47,900 --> 01:11:49,000
Norman.

951
01:11:50,300 --> 01:11:52,300
Do you remember
Lila Loomis?

952
01:11:54,100 --> 01:11:55,100
Yes.

953
01:11:55,500 --> 01:11:57,100
She's staying in town.

954
01:11:57,900 --> 01:11:58,900
She is?

955
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:05,500
She's Mary's mother.

956
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:09,500
That's why Mary went in
to town. To see her.

957
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,500
Do you realize
what this means, Norman?

958
01:12:17,900 --> 01:12:18,800
What?

959
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:21,600
They're the ones
who've been leaving the notes

960
01:12:21,500 --> 01:12:23,400
and making
the phone calls.

961
01:12:24,700 --> 01:12:25,700
Why would they do that?

962
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:27,400
Because they hate you.

963
01:12:28,600 --> 01:12:30,600
Mary, Mary doesn't hate me.

964
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:32,200
Come on, Norman.

965
01:12:32,200 --> 01:12:33,400
Like mother
like daughter.

966
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:35,600
You know how Lila Loomis
feels about you.

967
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:38,400
She can't wait see you
re-institutionalized.

968
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:41,000
That's why all this
is happening to you.

969
01:12:41,500 --> 01:12:42,900
They want to destabilize you,

970
01:12:42,900 --> 01:12:45,100
undermine your sense
of reality.

971
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:47,700
They can't do that.

972
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:50,000
Good. Glad to hear you
say that.

973
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:51,600
But...

974
01:12:52,900 --> 01:12:54,700
It isn't them, anyway.

975
01:12:54,700 --> 01:12:56,600
It isn't?
Who is it?

976
01:13:00,900 --> 01:13:02,300
It's my mother.

977
01:13:03,400 --> 01:13:06,200
She's not dead.

978
01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:11,900
How do you know that?

979
01:13:13,700 --> 01:13:15,800
I've seen her,
up in the window.

980
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:17,500
You saw her, too.

981
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:20,300
That was Mary Loomis

982
01:13:20,300 --> 01:13:23,700
or Lila Loomis dressed up
to look like your mother.

983
01:13:24,100 --> 01:13:26,100
What about the phone calls?

984
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:27,700
Mary Loomis again.

985
01:13:28,900 --> 01:13:31,500
But she's been with me
when the phone rang.

986
01:13:31,900 --> 01:13:33,700
Then it was her mother.

987
01:13:44,500 --> 01:13:46,900
My mother spoke to me.
Downstairs.

988
01:13:51,400 --> 01:13:52,500
Norman.

989
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,800
Do you remember now our
discussions about your mother?

990
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:02,200
Once you accepted the fact
that you murdered her,

991
01:14:02,100 --> 01:14:04,700
her memory would have
no hold over you.

992
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:14,500
Room 15, please.

993
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,300
I want you
to stop calling Norman.

994
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:19,500
What are you
doing here?

995
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:21,500
You heard me.
Stop calling Norman.

996
01:14:21,500 --> 01:14:22,500
I haven't called him.

997
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:24,600
Don't lie to me.
You called him this morning.

998
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:27,100
For God's sake,
keep your voice down.

999
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:33,100
All right,
so what if I did call him?

1000
01:14:33,200 --> 01:14:35,000
He's slipping
into insanity again,

1001
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:36,600
I can hear it in his voice.

1002
01:14:36,700 --> 01:14:38,600
There's nothing anyone
can do about it,

1003
01:14:38,500 --> 01:14:39,600
not even you.

1004
01:14:39,500 --> 01:14:41,600
You could stop stuffing
bloody towels down toilets

1005
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:43,300
and peering through
peepholes in walls.

1006
01:14:43,300 --> 01:14:44,400
That would be a help.
What?

1007
01:14:44,300 --> 01:14:45,600
What are you talking about?

1008
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:47,100
About what you're doing
to Norman.

1009
01:14:47,100 --> 01:14:48,600
You were in that house
last night.

1010
01:14:48,700 --> 01:14:49,700
I was not.

1011
01:14:49,700 --> 01:14:51,700
I came right back here
after I saw you.

1012
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:52,700
Don't lie to me.

1013
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:54,000
I'm not lying.

1014
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:55,700
Why weren't you
in your room last night

1015
01:14:55,700 --> 01:14:56,700
when I called?

1016
01:14:56,700 --> 01:14:59,000
What, did you have me paged?
I was probably down here.

1017
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,400
Mother, stop lying to me,
please.

1018
01:15:01,400 --> 01:15:03,600
What happened in that house
last night?

1019
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:05,000
Goodbye, Mother.

1020
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:09,400
He's about to go
over the edge, isn't he?

1021
01:15:09,300 --> 01:15:10,700
Listen. Now listen.

1022
01:15:10,700 --> 01:15:12,300
Just dress up
in his mother's clothes

1023
01:15:12,300 --> 01:15:14,300
one more time.
That's all it's going to take.

1024
01:15:14,300 --> 01:15:15,800
I'll have the police
and the doctor

1025
01:15:15,800 --> 01:15:16,800
before you are in danger.

1026
01:15:16,900 --> 01:15:18,800
Then they'll have to act
on our petition.

1027
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:20,700
Mother, I signed
all your petitions.

1028
01:15:20,700 --> 01:15:22,200
I've been to
all your meetings,

1029
01:15:22,200 --> 01:15:23,900
done everything
you've asked for years.

1030
01:15:23,900 --> 01:15:25,900
But I am not going to
hurt Norman anymore.

1031
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:27,300
Well, if you won't do it
for me,

1032
01:15:27,300 --> 01:15:28,600
at least do it
for your father.

1033
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:30,800
I'm not living for dead people
anymore, Mother.

1034
01:15:30,900 --> 01:15:32,800
Not for your sister,
or my father,

1035
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:34,500
not even for you.
I'm going.

1036
01:15:34,500 --> 01:15:36,400
Now, wait a minute.

1037
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:38,900
Mother, let go,
you're hurting me.

1038
01:15:41,800 --> 01:15:42,900
Mom, don't.

1039
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:43,900
No.

1040
01:15:48,900 --> 01:15:52,000
Listen to me! If you go near that
house, you're going to be sorry.

1041
01:15:53,300 --> 01:15:54,300
Yeah.

1042
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:56,200
I don't see
what all the rush is for.

1043
01:15:56,100 --> 01:15:57,200
The Sheriff's concerned.

1044
01:15:57,200 --> 01:15:59,600
And he thought we might
bend the rules.

1045
01:15:59,900 --> 01:16:00,900
I don't like it.

1046
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,800
You're supposed to have
an order from the coroner.

1047
01:16:17,800 --> 01:16:19,700
Now do you believe me?

1048
01:16:20,900 --> 01:16:22,500
Yes. She's dead.

1049
01:16:24,600 --> 01:16:27,500
Then she's not coming back
to life again, is she?

1050
01:16:29,100 --> 01:16:30,300
Back to life?

1051
01:16:33,400 --> 01:16:34,400
No.

1052
01:16:38,100 --> 01:16:39,400
Shall we go?

1053
01:16:56,900 --> 01:16:58,000
Mary.

1054
01:16:57,900 --> 01:16:59,500
Back here.

1055
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:08,300
I was just about
to have some lunch.

1056
01:17:08,300 --> 01:17:09,300
You want some?

1057
01:17:09,300 --> 01:17:10,200
No.

1058
01:17:11,100 --> 01:17:12,600
Where have you been?

1059
01:17:13,100 --> 01:17:14,500
At the cemetery.

1060
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,800
Dr. Raymond had them open up
my mother's coffin.

1061
01:17:17,700 --> 01:17:18,700
Oh.

1062
01:17:19,100 --> 01:17:20,100
Yes.

1063
01:17:20,500 --> 01:17:22,000
That proves that
she's not the one

1064
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:23,800
who's been
torturing me.

1065
01:17:23,800 --> 01:17:26,600
Not unless
she's a ghost.

1066
01:17:27,200 --> 01:17:28,200
No.

1067
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:30,300
No. He says,

1068
01:17:30,700 --> 01:17:32,800
he says it's you
and your mother.

1069
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:35,700
He says your last name
is Loomis.

1070
01:17:36,300 --> 01:17:37,700
Is that true, Mary?

1071
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:45,000
I wonder
who that could be.

1072
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:47,100
I don't know.

1073
01:17:48,300 --> 01:17:49,600
Don't you?

1074
01:17:55,200 --> 01:17:57,700
Hello, Mrs. Loomis?
How are you this...

1075
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,800
I'm... I'm sorry, Mother.

1076
01:18:06,700 --> 01:18:08,800
I didn't mean to insult you.

1077
01:18:09,500 --> 01:18:12,400
Norman, stop it.
This is not your mother.

1078
01:18:12,700 --> 01:18:16,200
Hello. Hello, Lila?
Lila, are you there?

1079
01:18:17,800 --> 01:18:19,600
There's no one on the line.

1080
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:22,400
Hello?

1081
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:26,300
Yes, Mother, I'm sorry
we were interrupted.

1082
01:18:27,400 --> 01:18:29,000
Norman, there's no one there.

1083
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:30,200
Yes, Mother.

1084
01:18:37,900 --> 01:18:39,000
Yes, Mother.

1085
01:18:40,700 --> 01:18:41,700
<i>Hello?</i>

1086
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:44,200
Hello, Norman?
This is your mother.

1087
01:18:44,200 --> 01:18:45,300
<i>It doesn't sound like her.</i>

1088
01:18:45,300 --> 01:18:47,300
It is, Norman,
and I want you to hang up.

1089
01:18:47,400 --> 01:18:49,600
Do you understand? Hang up.

1090
01:18:51,800 --> 01:18:53,000
All right.

1091
01:18:53,200 --> 01:18:54,900
Do it, Norman, now.

1092
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:57,400
<i>Hang up.</i>

1093
01:19:15,100 --> 01:19:16,600
I was so worried.

1094
01:19:17,900 --> 01:19:19,000
About what?

1095
01:19:19,100 --> 01:19:21,400
Well, that all the things
that have been happening to me

1096
01:19:21,400 --> 01:19:23,000
were because of you
and your mother.

1097
01:19:22,900 --> 01:19:25,300
When Dr. Raymond showed me
Mrs. Bates' corpse,

1098
01:19:25,300 --> 01:19:27,500
I knew she was dead for sure.

1099
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:29,600
But now,

1100
01:19:29,900 --> 01:19:32,200
now I know it's somebody
completely different.

1101
01:19:32,200 --> 01:19:33,400
Who is it?

1102
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:36,300
My real mother.

1103
01:19:37,700 --> 01:19:39,800
Who is your real mother,
Norman?

1104
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:43,200
I don't know.

1105
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:44,700
She won't tell me.

1106
01:19:44,700 --> 01:19:45,800
Your mother is dead.

1107
01:19:45,900 --> 01:19:47,300
Mrs. Bates
was your real mother

1108
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:48,600
and she's dead.

1109
01:19:49,400 --> 01:19:51,600
Then who was that
on the phone?

1110
01:19:53,400 --> 01:19:54,600
My mother.

1111
01:19:56,700 --> 01:19:59,200
Dr. Raymond was right
about both of us.

1112
01:19:59,900 --> 01:20:02,800
Lila and I were trying
to drive you crazy again.

1113
01:20:03,800 --> 01:20:06,100
But then I stopped,
only she won't,

1114
01:20:06,100 --> 01:20:08,300
and she's the one
who's calling.

1115
01:20:16,900 --> 01:20:18,400
Well, why did you stop?

1116
01:20:18,500 --> 01:20:20,000
It wasn't fair for us
to be doing

1117
01:20:19,900 --> 01:20:21,900
what we were doing to you.

1118
01:20:21,900 --> 01:20:23,600
Is that the only reason?

1119
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:25,400
What do you mean?

1120
01:20:25,700 --> 01:20:27,200
You know what I mean.

1121
01:20:45,400 --> 01:20:46,400
Ma'am?

1122
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:48,000
Norman?

1123
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:51,300
The Sheriff would like
to see you out at the swamp.

1124
01:21:13,300 --> 01:21:14,200
Hey, Sam.

1125
01:21:14,300 --> 01:21:15,500
Yeah?

1126
01:21:16,100 --> 01:21:17,400
Scotch it is.

1127
01:21:18,300 --> 01:21:19,800
There you go.

1128
01:21:59,700 --> 01:22:01,600
All right.
Spread that line away.

1129
01:22:01,700 --> 01:22:04,900
We're gonna send the divers
down here in a minute.

1130
01:22:12,900 --> 01:22:14,000
Hello, Norman.

1131
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:15,100
Hi, Sheriff.

1132
01:22:15,100 --> 01:22:17,300
What is... What is
going on here?

1133
01:22:17,300 --> 01:22:19,000
Have you
seen this before?

1134
01:22:19,100 --> 01:22:21,300
No. Did you... Did you find it
in the swamp?

1135
01:22:21,300 --> 01:22:22,300
Yes.

1136
01:22:23,200 --> 01:22:25,300
How about any of this stuff?

1137
01:22:27,100 --> 01:22:28,600
This is Mr. Toomey's.

1138
01:22:28,600 --> 01:22:29,600
Who?

1139
01:22:30,300 --> 01:22:33,200
Norman's motel manager,
before he fired him, that is.

1140
01:22:33,200 --> 01:22:34,900
Have you seen him since?

1141
01:22:35,100 --> 01:22:37,300
No, I told him
to get packing and he left.

1142
01:22:37,300 --> 01:22:38,900
That's all I know.

1143
01:22:38,900 --> 01:22:39,900
You sure?

1144
01:22:40,300 --> 01:22:41,400
Y-Yeah.

1145
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:45,500
Well, that's about it then.
You can leave.

1146
01:22:47,400 --> 01:22:49,000
Just you, Norman,
not the young lady.

1147
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:50,500
Okay. But shouldn't I wait?

1148
01:22:50,600 --> 01:22:51,700
Don't worry.

1149
01:22:51,700 --> 01:22:53,800
I'll have her
along presently.

1150
01:22:54,100 --> 01:22:56,100
Oh, forget the marker.
Get on in there.

1151
01:22:56,100 --> 01:22:58,400
Sheriff, I've been
wanting talk to you.

1152
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:00,200
Yeah.

1153
01:23:00,300 --> 01:23:01,800
Someone has been
phoning Norman

1154
01:23:01,800 --> 01:23:03,300
claiming to be his mother.

1155
01:23:03,200 --> 01:23:06,000
And not the dead Mrs. Bates,
his real mother.

1156
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:06,900
So?

1157
01:23:08,200 --> 01:23:09,300
So I've been wondering

1158
01:23:09,300 --> 01:23:11,700
if it's possible
that he was adopted?

1159
01:23:12,900 --> 01:23:14,400
Not that I've ever heard of,

1160
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:17,500
and I've lived my entire life
here, Miss Loomis.

1161
01:23:19,300 --> 01:23:21,000
How did you find out
who I was?

1162
01:23:21,100 --> 01:23:24,000
We're a tad slow
around here, young lady,

1163
01:23:23,900 --> 01:23:25,300
but not incompetent.

1164
01:23:25,400 --> 01:23:26,400
Now,

1165
01:23:26,700 --> 01:23:28,500
I've got a question for you.

1166
01:23:28,700 --> 01:23:31,300
Either you or your mother
know anything about this?

1167
01:23:31,300 --> 01:23:32,300
No.

1168
01:23:32,900 --> 01:23:34,900
I don't see any point in
either of you stayin' around

1169
01:23:34,900 --> 01:23:36,600
Fairvale any longer, do you?

1170
01:23:36,600 --> 01:23:38,500
Have we broken some law?

1171
01:23:41,800 --> 01:23:43,600
None that are on the books,

1172
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:46,100
but a whole hell
of a lot of them that aren't.

1173
01:23:46,100 --> 01:23:48,900
Like all the ones having to do
with right or wrong.

1174
01:23:49,100 --> 01:23:50,800
I'd say you and your mother
just about

1175
01:23:50,700 --> 01:23:52,900
broken every one of those,
wouldn't you?

1176
01:23:52,900 --> 01:23:54,200
I didn't mean to.

1177
01:23:54,200 --> 01:23:56,500
Well, that's what
Norman said 20 years ago.

1178
01:23:56,400 --> 01:23:58,000
Only he was crazy.

1179
01:23:57,900 --> 01:23:59,800
Now, what's your excuse?

1180
01:24:01,300 --> 01:24:03,300
I guess I don't have one.

1181
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:06,100
Well, I'll just say goodbye
to you now then.

1182
01:24:06,100 --> 01:24:07,600
I expect it to be
for the last time.

1183
01:24:07,700 --> 01:24:08,900
Sheriff.

1184
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:10,900
I said goodbye,
Miss Loomis.

1185
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:13,600
Sheriff, there's a car
down here.

1186
01:24:13,600 --> 01:24:14,700
Anybody in it?

1187
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:16,300
I can't tell.
It's stuck in the mud.

1188
01:24:16,300 --> 01:24:19,700
Well, get a winch line down
to it and get it out of there.

1189
01:24:19,800 --> 01:24:21,900
All right,
we found a car.

1190
01:27:24,700 --> 01:27:25,700
Doctor?

1191
01:27:26,700 --> 01:27:28,700
What are you doing here?

1192
01:27:30,900 --> 01:27:34,500
I followed Lila Loomis
from her hotel to your house.

1193
01:27:35,300 --> 01:27:36,800
She came down here.

1194
01:27:37,300 --> 01:27:38,300
Oh.

1195
01:27:40,100 --> 01:27:41,600
Where is she?

1196
01:27:42,200 --> 01:27:43,700
I don't know.

1197
01:27:45,700 --> 01:27:47,200
But she was here.

1198
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:52,000
It proves she was the one

1199
01:27:52,100 --> 01:27:54,400
that was dressing up
as your mother.

1200
01:27:54,400 --> 01:27:55,500
How?

1201
01:27:57,400 --> 01:27:59,200
If she wasn't
gonna do it again,

1202
01:27:59,200 --> 01:28:01,200
why would she sneak
into your house?

1203
01:28:01,200 --> 01:28:03,200
But she wasn't the woman
I saw in the window.

1204
01:28:03,100 --> 01:28:04,300
She wasn't?

1205
01:28:04,500 --> 01:28:05,400
No.

1206
01:28:05,400 --> 01:28:06,600
Then who was?

1207
01:28:07,200 --> 01:28:08,700
That was my mother.

1208
01:28:08,600 --> 01:28:11,000
Norman, your mother's dead.

1209
01:28:12,200 --> 01:28:14,200
Remember the open coffin?

1210
01:28:14,500 --> 01:28:16,800
Mrs. Bates only
took care of me.

1211
01:28:16,800 --> 01:28:20,300
My real mother is somebody
completely different.

1212
01:28:22,200 --> 01:28:23,700
How do you
know this, Norman?

1213
01:28:23,700 --> 01:28:25,900
She told me on the phone.

1214
01:28:28,200 --> 01:28:29,700
Norman, I've already
proved to you

1215
01:28:29,700 --> 01:28:31,400
that Mary and Lila Loomis
were the ones

1216
01:28:31,400 --> 01:28:32,800
who were calling you.

1217
01:28:32,900 --> 01:28:34,700
Would you accept the fact

1218
01:28:34,600 --> 01:28:37,600
that you have no other mother
than Mrs. Bates?

1219
01:28:39,800 --> 01:28:40,900
Of course.

1220
01:28:41,700 --> 01:28:43,600
Then that's what I'll do.

1221
01:28:47,800 --> 01:28:49,400
It would be a great load
off my mind.

1222
01:28:54,400 --> 01:28:56,300
Okay, everybody stand back.

1223
01:28:57,700 --> 01:28:59,000
That's it.

1224
01:29:00,400 --> 01:29:01,700
Keep it comin'.

1225
01:29:03,300 --> 01:29:05,400
Looks like Toomey's car,
doesn't it?

1226
01:29:05,500 --> 01:29:07,400
That's it, a little more.

1227
01:29:07,300 --> 01:29:09,700
We'll check inside
before we open the trunk.

1228
01:29:09,700 --> 01:29:10,800
All right.

1229
01:29:11,100 --> 01:29:12,600
That's it.

1230
01:29:12,800 --> 01:29:13,900
Do you recognize it?

1231
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:15,500
Okay, hold it right there.

1232
01:29:15,500 --> 01:29:16,700
Well?

1233
01:29:20,100 --> 01:29:21,800
Sheriff, it's empty.

1234
01:29:23,500 --> 01:29:26,000
Don't you have
some place else to go?

1235
01:29:28,400 --> 01:29:30,100
Open the trunk.

1236
01:29:31,700 --> 01:29:33,100
Watch out,
Mike.

1237
01:29:34,300 --> 01:29:35,600
Oh, Jesus.

1238
01:29:47,200 --> 01:29:49,500
Norman. Norman!

1239
01:29:49,400 --> 01:29:50,300
What is it?

1240
01:29:50,300 --> 01:29:51,600
They found a car
in the swamp.

1241
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:53,200
Who? I don't know who it is.

1242
01:29:53,200 --> 01:29:55,600
They just found a car.
Isn't that enough? For what?

1243
01:29:55,600 --> 01:29:57,500
For them to arrest you!
I'll get your jacket!

1244
01:29:57,500 --> 01:29:58,900
Come on.
We're getting out of here.

1245
01:29:59,000 --> 01:29:59,900
How?

1246
01:30:00,900 --> 01:30:03,600
I don't know. We'll hitch
a ride until we get a car.

1247
01:30:03,500 --> 01:30:04,900
Where would we go?

1248
01:30:04,900 --> 01:30:06,100
Somewhere,
anywhere, Norman.

1249
01:30:06,200 --> 01:30:07,600
Please hurry.

1250
01:30:07,800 --> 01:30:09,300
They'd catch us.

1251
01:30:11,100 --> 01:30:12,000
You're right.

1252
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:13,800
So what's the point
of going?

1253
01:30:14,100 --> 01:30:16,000
Because it's my fault.

1254
01:30:17,200 --> 01:30:18,800
If my mother and I
had left you alone,

1255
01:30:18,800 --> 01:30:20,400
you would've been fine.

1256
01:30:20,400 --> 01:30:21,500
Nobody'd be dead,

1257
01:30:21,500 --> 01:30:23,000
and I'd just be
a dumb psych student

1258
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:24,900
with nothing on mind
but having a good time.

1259
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:26,400
It's not your fault.

1260
01:30:26,400 --> 01:30:28,100
Then whose fault is it?

1261
01:30:28,100 --> 01:30:29,000
My mother's.

1262
01:30:29,100 --> 01:30:30,900
She's the one
who's been doing the killing

1263
01:30:30,900 --> 01:30:33,100
to protect me.
She told me so herself.

1264
01:30:33,100 --> 01:30:34,400
Oh, Norman.

1265
01:30:35,600 --> 01:30:37,200
You're mad,
don't you know that?

1266
01:30:37,200 --> 01:30:39,000
You're mad as a hatter.

1267
01:30:41,300 --> 01:30:42,800
Should I answer it?

1268
01:30:42,800 --> 01:30:44,100
Why bother?

1269
01:30:44,300 --> 01:30:46,400
It's only my mother,
poor thing.

1270
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:48,000
She shouldn't be calling.

1271
01:30:48,100 --> 01:30:50,400
She should be sitting back
and gloating.

1272
01:30:50,900 --> 01:30:52,500
I better answer it.

1273
01:31:01,100 --> 01:31:02,100
Hello?

1274
01:31:02,400 --> 01:31:03,900
Norman, this is Dr. Raymond.

1275
01:31:03,900 --> 01:31:06,400
I just found Lila Loomis' car
parked down the road.

1276
01:31:06,400 --> 01:31:08,200
I'm calling you
from the motel parlor.

1277
01:31:08,100 --> 01:31:09,800
The calls that
you've been receiving

1278
01:31:09,800 --> 01:31:11,200
from your fictitious mother

1279
01:31:11,200 --> 01:31:12,500
have been placed
right here.

1280
01:31:12,500 --> 01:31:15,000
Lila Loomis has used
this phone to call your house.

1281
01:31:15,600 --> 01:31:16,600
Yes.

1282
01:31:18,100 --> 01:31:19,500
L... I understand.

1283
01:31:19,800 --> 01:31:20,800
Mother?

1284
01:31:21,100 --> 01:31:23,500
Norman,
this is Dr. Raymond.

1285
01:31:25,200 --> 01:31:27,500
I've been waiting
for your call, Mother.

1286
01:31:30,800 --> 01:31:31,900
Hello. Lila?

1287
01:31:32,500 --> 01:31:33,800
<i>Lila...</i>

1288
01:31:36,500 --> 01:31:37,800
She's hung up.

1289
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,200
No, Mother.
Mary's still here with me.

1290
01:31:48,200 --> 01:31:49,500
I like her.

1291
01:31:51,800 --> 01:31:52,800
No.

1292
01:31:53,200 --> 01:31:55,700
No, of course not.
Not as much as you.

1293
01:31:59,100 --> 01:32:00,200
No, I...

1294
01:32:01,500 --> 01:32:03,000
I won't do that.

1295
01:32:04,600 --> 01:32:06,100
You can't make me

1296
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:10,700
kill her.

1297
01:32:11,600 --> 01:32:14,200
Do I have to, Mother?

1298
01:32:15,800 --> 01:32:17,000
But why?

1299
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:18,800
Why do I
have to kill her?

1300
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,200
Oh, no, Mother, please.

1301
01:32:54,200 --> 01:32:55,800
Please don't make me...

1302
01:32:58,000 --> 01:32:58,900
Oh, Mother,

1303
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,200
How can you even think
such a thing?

1304
01:33:01,100 --> 01:33:03,300
I can never do
anything like that.

1305
01:33:04,200 --> 01:33:06,900
I don't think you understand
about Mary, Mother.

1306
01:33:07,700 --> 01:33:09,600
She's really very kind.

1307
01:33:11,100 --> 01:33:12,200
I trust her.

1308
01:33:12,200 --> 01:33:13,900
She would never do anything
to hurt me.

1309
01:33:13,900 --> 01:33:16,100
Norman? Norman.

1310
01:33:17,700 --> 01:33:20,400
Do you recognize me?
It's me, your mother.

1311
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:22,100
Yes, Mother.

1312
01:33:22,100 --> 01:33:24,100
And since I'm standing here
in front of you,

1313
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,700
I can't very well be
on the phone, can I?

1314
01:33:27,100 --> 01:33:30,000
So hang up the phone,
Norman. Hang up.

1315
01:33:31,100 --> 01:33:32,400
Yes, Mother.

1316
01:33:33,200 --> 01:33:35,800
Norman, put the phone down
this instant!

1317
01:33:44,300 --> 01:33:46,100
Norman, this is your mother.

1318
01:33:47,300 --> 01:33:49,200
Norman, can you hear me?

1319
01:33:51,900 --> 01:33:52,900
Norman.

1320
01:33:55,300 --> 01:33:57,000
Norman, are you there?

1321
01:34:03,300 --> 01:34:05,700
Norman, please say something.

1322
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:12,300
Norman.

1323
01:34:15,600 --> 01:34:16,900
Norman.

1324
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:18,000
Got you!

1325
01:34:17,900 --> 01:34:19,500
Norman!

1326
01:34:37,900 --> 01:34:39,400
Norman, I...

1327
01:34:40,900 --> 01:34:42,600
I didn't mean to do it. L... I...

1328
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:45,700
I thought he was you.

1329
01:34:45,800 --> 01:34:47,300
It's all right, Mother.

1330
01:34:47,400 --> 01:34:49,300
Norman, I'm not your mother.

1331
01:34:49,900 --> 01:34:51,200
It's all right.

1332
01:34:51,300 --> 01:34:53,500
Norman, I am not your mother.
I am Mary.

1333
01:34:53,400 --> 01:34:54,900
How many times
have you killed?

1334
01:34:54,800 --> 01:34:56,300
How many times
have I told you...

1335
01:34:56,300 --> 01:34:58,000
Norman, look,
I am Mary.

1336
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,500
They're gonna come for you,
Mother, just like they did before.

1337
01:35:00,500 --> 01:35:02,100
Stay away from me.

1338
01:35:05,500 --> 01:35:07,000
And I'll cover up for you.

1339
01:35:06,900 --> 01:35:07,900
Now give me the knife.

1340
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:09,200
Stay away.

1341
01:35:09,500 --> 01:35:12,100
I always have,
because I'm your dutiful son.

1342
01:35:12,100 --> 01:35:13,700
Stay away.

1343
01:35:13,700 --> 01:35:15,300
And you're my loving mother.

1344
01:35:15,400 --> 01:35:17,500
So, please give me the knife.

1345
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:23,300
It's time to go to the fruit
cellar now, Mother.

1346
01:35:23,100 --> 01:35:24,600
Norman, stay away.

1347
01:35:24,700 --> 01:35:27,800
Mother, I don't want to...

1348
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:30,100
Norman, now, look.

1349
01:35:31,400 --> 01:35:33,000
I don't want
to hurt you, Mother.

1350
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:34,300
You're coming.

1351
01:35:36,900 --> 01:35:39,300
In there, Mother, hurry.

1352
01:35:39,200 --> 01:35:41,000
Norman, please stop.

1353
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:43,000
You... You need help.
You're losing blood.

1354
01:35:59,400 --> 01:36:00,800
You did it.

1355
01:36:03,500 --> 01:36:06,400
They're here.
Let me help you.

1356
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:07,600
You killed them all.

1357
01:36:07,600 --> 01:36:08,800
Freeze!

1358
01:36:16,100 --> 01:36:17,300
The County Sheriff
and the DA

1359
01:36:17,300 --> 01:36:18,600
have come down
from Bakersfield

1360
01:36:18,700 --> 01:36:20,200
to confer with Sheriff Hunt.

1361
01:36:20,200 --> 01:36:21,600
Is that loud enough, guys?

1362
01:36:21,600 --> 01:36:24,200
Yeah, that... that's good.
Move over to your left.

1363
01:36:24,200 --> 01:36:26,800
I'll get the City Hall
in the background.

1364
01:36:27,300 --> 01:36:28,600
Okay, we'll go in

1365
01:36:28,600 --> 01:36:31,400
Five, four, three...

1366
01:36:43,800 --> 01:36:45,000
You want to read
through this

1367
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:47,600
and make sure
it's exactly what you said.

1368
01:36:48,900 --> 01:36:50,500
Yeah, that's...
No, wait a minute.

1369
01:36:50,500 --> 01:36:51,400
She didn't say that.

1370
01:36:51,500 --> 01:36:52,900
She said
if she didn't stay away,

1371
01:36:52,900 --> 01:36:54,200
she'd be sorry.
Sorry.

1372
01:36:54,100 --> 01:36:55,100
Not that
she'd kill him?

1373
01:36:55,200 --> 01:36:57,100
Can I get a cup of coffee? In a minute.

1374
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:59,200
Everybody's getting
coffee around here.

1375
01:37:02,400 --> 01:37:03,500
...the suspect,

1376
01:37:03,500 --> 01:37:05,600
uh, wielding a big knife...

1377
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,100
...the victim.
I drew myself...

1378
01:37:10,100 --> 01:37:12,300
So, she and her mother
were trying to put Norman

1379
01:37:12,300 --> 01:37:13,700
back in the asylum.

1380
01:37:14,200 --> 01:37:16,300
Well, that much
we know for sure.

1381
01:37:16,300 --> 01:37:18,200
Then somethin' went wrong
between them.

1382
01:37:18,200 --> 01:37:19,100
What?

1383
01:37:19,200 --> 01:37:20,500
They had a fight.

1384
01:37:20,500 --> 01:37:22,200
She wanted Lila
to leave Norman alone,

1385
01:37:22,200 --> 01:37:23,600
but she wouldn't.

1386
01:37:23,800 --> 01:37:25,800
We have a witness
that heard the whole thing.

1387
01:37:25,800 --> 01:37:28,300
So she murdered
her own mother over Norman?

1388
01:37:28,300 --> 01:37:29,500
Looks like it.

1389
01:37:29,900 --> 01:37:31,500
What about the bodies
in the swamp?

1390
01:37:31,500 --> 01:37:33,100
The boy
and that motel manager?

1391
01:37:33,200 --> 01:37:35,000
Mary and Lila Loomis did it.

1392
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:37,200
They tried to blame
the murders on Norman.

1393
01:37:37,100 --> 01:37:39,300
Or maybe only the daughter
did it.

1394
01:37:40,300 --> 01:37:42,300
She definitely
killed Dr. Raymond.

1395
01:37:42,300 --> 01:37:44,500
I'll tell you, If you had seen
Mary Loomis at the end,

1396
01:37:44,500 --> 01:37:45,800
you wouldn't
have questioned it.

1397
01:37:45,800 --> 01:37:47,200
She'd gone mad.

1398
01:37:47,200 --> 01:37:50,100
Dressed up in Norman's
mother's clothes and a wig,

1399
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:51,100
trying to kill Norman,

1400
01:37:51,100 --> 01:37:53,900
and him hardly even able
to defend himself any longer.

1401
01:37:53,900 --> 01:37:55,400
Right till the end,
she kept saying

1402
01:37:55,400 --> 01:37:57,500
Norman was the one
who was crazy.

1403
01:37:57,600 --> 01:37:59,000
It was horrible.

1404
01:38:08,200 --> 01:38:09,200
What about it, Norman?

1405
01:38:09,200 --> 01:38:10,600
Are you ready to go home?

1406
01:38:11,600 --> 01:38:14,500
Lt'll all be in my report
tomorrow, gentlemen.

1407
01:38:19,700 --> 01:38:21,600
Uh, let's go out
the back.

1408
01:40:56,800 --> 01:40:57,900
Mrs. Spool.

1409
01:40:57,900 --> 01:40:58,900
Hello, Norman.

1410
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:00,100
Come in.

1411
01:41:03,400 --> 01:41:05,500
I was just having
some supper.

1412
01:41:05,500 --> 01:41:07,400
Nothing much,
but would you like

1413
01:41:07,400 --> 01:41:09,500
to share my
toasted cheese sandwich?

1414
01:41:09,500 --> 01:41:11,200
Oh, no, thank you.

1415
01:41:16,100 --> 01:41:18,900
It's, uh,
Miss Spool, actually.

1416
01:41:18,800 --> 01:41:19,800
Oh.

1417
01:41:21,800 --> 01:41:23,800
You were expecting me.

1418
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,600
Well, I was...
I was expecting someone.

1419
01:41:26,600 --> 01:41:28,400
I just wasn't sure of when.

1420
01:41:29,800 --> 01:41:30,700
Tea?

1421
01:41:30,700 --> 01:41:31,700
Please.

1422
01:41:43,700 --> 01:41:44,700
Milk and sugar?

1423
01:41:44,700 --> 01:41:46,200
That would be nice.

1424
01:41:47,900 --> 01:41:48,900
So,

1425
01:41:49,500 --> 01:41:51,300
are you really my mother?

1426
01:41:52,400 --> 01:41:54,900
The name Spool doesn't mean
anything to you?

1427
01:41:54,900 --> 01:41:56,200
No. Should it?

1428
01:41:56,300 --> 01:41:58,300
It was Norma Bates'
maiden name.

1429
01:41:58,400 --> 01:42:01,200
The woman you thought
was your mother was my sister.

1430
01:42:02,400 --> 01:42:05,300
I had you when I was
very young out of wedlock.

1431
01:42:06,400 --> 01:42:08,600
I couldn't handle
a brand-new baby,

1432
01:42:08,600 --> 01:42:11,300
especially, uh,
being by myself.

1433
01:42:13,200 --> 01:42:14,300
I had some trouble

1434
01:42:14,400 --> 01:42:16,800
and the State put me away
for a while.

1435
01:42:17,900 --> 01:42:20,000
That's when
Norma took you in.

1436
01:42:20,800 --> 01:42:23,000
You were less
than a year old.

1437
01:42:23,700 --> 01:42:25,700
Too young to remember me.

1438
01:42:26,600 --> 01:42:28,700
She never mentioned me,
did she?

1439
01:42:28,800 --> 01:42:31,500
No, she, uh,
she didn't.

1440
01:42:33,300 --> 01:42:34,800
I guess she didn't
want you to know

1441
01:42:34,800 --> 01:42:37,900
that you had a mother
who wasn't quite right.

1442
01:42:41,400 --> 01:42:45,800
But we know all about that,
don't we, Norman?

1443
01:42:45,900 --> 01:42:46,800
Mmm-hmm.

1444
01:42:47,200 --> 01:42:49,600
After I got out, you'd already
had your troubles

1445
01:42:49,600 --> 01:42:51,000
and been committed.

1446
01:42:51,400 --> 01:42:53,200
I decided to wait for you.

1447
01:42:53,300 --> 01:42:55,400
Then when I saw
what they were trying to do

1448
01:42:55,400 --> 01:42:58,100
to my poor little boy,
I couldn't stand it.

1449
01:42:58,400 --> 01:43:00,000
So I followed them,

1450
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:02,600
and one by one...

1451
01:43:03,900 --> 01:43:05,200
After all,

1452
01:43:06,200 --> 01:43:08,500
you're all I have
in this world.

1453
01:43:20,200 --> 01:43:22,500
You're sure you won't
have a sandwich?

1454
01:43:23,900 --> 01:43:25,000
Pardon?

1455
01:44:10,100 --> 01:44:11,600
I know how it is, Mother.

1456
01:44:11,700 --> 01:44:14,300
You've had a long day.
You must be tired.

1457
01:44:14,500 --> 01:44:17,600
I'll just put you to bed
and tuck you in for the night.

1458
01:44:17,600 --> 01:44:19,900
I'll even say your prayers
for you.

1459
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:21,500
Would you like that?

1460
01:44:26,900 --> 01:44:28,900
<i>I'm not sleepy.</i>

1461
01:44:29,500 --> 01:44:31,500
<i>Put me in my chair.</i>

1462
01:44:31,700 --> 01:44:33,300
Yes, Mother.

1463
01:44:33,200 --> 01:44:35,900
<i>And now,
turn me to the window.</i>

1464
01:44:35,800 --> 01:44:38,300
<i>I want to keep my eyes
on you.</i>

1465
01:44:38,400 --> 01:44:40,200
<i>Make sure
you don't start playing</i>

1466
01:44:40,200 --> 01:44:43,100
<i>with filthy girls again.</i>

1467
01:44:43,100 --> 01:44:44,100
Yes, Mother.

1468
01:44:44,200 --> 01:44:45,200
<i>Good.</i>

1469
01:44:46,200 --> 01:44:48,500
<i>Well, what are you
gawking at?</i>

1470
01:44:48,600 --> 01:44:50,700
<i>Go downstairs
and open the motel.</i>

1471
01:44:50,700 --> 01:44:52,900
<i>What do you expect us
to live on, hope?</i>

1472
01:44:52,900 --> 01:44:54,200
No, Mother.

1473
01:44:54,400 --> 01:44:56,000
<i>Remember, Norman,</i>

1474
01:44:56,100 --> 01:44:58,600
<i>I'm the only who loves you.</i>

1475
01:44:58,600 --> 01:45:02,200
<i>Only your mother
truly loves you.</i>
