We like to think of ourselves
as being ahead of the curve.

168
00:08:52,823 --> 00:08:56,117
One teacher for each subject.

169
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:59,704
I guess that makes you
our very own Ms. Math.

to lighten up the decor,

173

- You made a mistake.

174
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:20,725
I'm not a teacher.

175
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:21,768
I...

176
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:23,019
- There's an old saying:

177
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:26,398
"No one is a teacher
until they're a teacher."

178
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:35,949
- I had math in this room
with Mr. Jones.

179
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:41,788

Who can tell me the next number
in this pattern?

Miss Gray?

184
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:58,972
- 34.

185
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:03,310
- You are correct!

186
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:10,150
- I never saw him without
a wax number around his neck.

187
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:19,909
The numbers varied
according to his mood.

188
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:22,370
He'd go higher
in a better mood,

189
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:24,706
lower if he felt lower.

190
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:35,133
I wondered if he had
the numbers my dad needed.

191
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:38,720
To the world,
they were just numbers.

192
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:42,849
But to us,
they were invisible signs.

193
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:57,405
Mr. Jones quit teaching
and opened a hardware store.

194
00:10:57,531 --> 00:11:01,034
And I was the only one
who understood why.

195
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,244
He was trying
to get his numbers up.

196
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:14,297
We don't talk anymore.

197
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:18,426

I like the 9 a lot.

- Danny O'Mazzi.

- Danny, you can't shoot people
in the head,

234
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:22,008
so go stand in the corner
and face the wall.

It's supposed to be
a punishment.

that Ellen always pees

no, 7.

- And what's the total
of Levan and Lisa?

- 8.

- That's right.

271
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:48,928
- The bugs in her gross hair
gave her the answer.

272
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:51,389
- I don't have bugs in my hair.

00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:52,640
- Ann's in a bad mood

274
00:14:52,766 --> 00:14:54,559
because her parents
are getting divorced.

275

My mom is her mom's attorney.

276

- They're not getting divorced!

They're getting
legally separated.

278

confidentiality is confidential.

00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:05,653
Shh.

280
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:08,448
All right, who wants
to be the 8?

281
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:09,532

the plus sign?

How about, uh...

291
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:52,533

00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:55,995
make numbers out of nature?

293
00:15:56,121 --> 00:16:00,833
One of you will bring in
a number

every Friday,

295

kind of like a show-and-tell

an epidemic.

- What's your location?

- What about chicken pox?
Rickets?

You know, you could do...
- Excuse me, miss?

676
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:06,079
- You could do malaria next week

if you do a really good
consumption today.

What do you think?

00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
- Wait.
What are my symptoms?

680
00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:11,543
- Fatigue, cough.
Let me hear a cough.

- It's a 7.

- That's not a 7.
That's an ax.

- It's a 7.

- Teacher's big fat pet.

- That's enough, Ann!

her dad has a girlfriend.

And my mom,
who's Ann's mom's attorney,

- It's a bird's beak.

Get in that corner!

So let's pretend it's a mouth,

and the mouth is always hungry.

737

And 179 is less than 255.

The mouth always wants
to eat the greater number.

The mouth eats 5,556

This is called
"greater than" and "less than."

- No, it isn't.

are made, man.

No person is any greater

You're the greatest teacher

Lisa seems to be happy

You must be creating

Did you ever hear
of such a thing?

- No.
Why don't you back off?

810

- Why don't you back off?
We're here.

811
00:42:50,025 --> 00:42:51,401
We should see
all of Ann's teachers.

812
00:42:51,527 --> 00:42:52,944
- Well, let's see
the math teacher last.

813
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:54,904
Ann said she's
a weirdo-bizarro.

814
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:02,078
- Hi.

815
00:43:02,204 --> 00:43:05,248
You must be the math teacher.

816

I'm Lisa's aunt.

817
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:10,920
- Lisa's one
of my brightest students.

818
00:43:11,046 --> 00:43:13,172
- I always hated math,
you know?

819
00:43:13,299 --> 00:43:16,134
But Lisa's a strange kid.

820
00:43:17,177 --> 00:43:21,055
- Well, you know,
it must not be easy for her

821
00:43:21,181 --> 00:43:22,682
right now.

822
00:43:22,808 --> 00:43:24,017
- Mm.

823
00:43:24,143 --> 00:43:26,853
What about me?

824
00:43:26,979 --> 00:43:29,772
You know, I drove
halfway across the country

825
00:43:29,898 --> 00:43:31,941
to take care of her and...

826
00:43:32,067 --> 00:43:36,029
haven't gotten so much
as a "thank you" from anyone.

827
00:43:36,155 --> 00:43:39,532
You know, I was gonna get
my real estate license,

828
00:43:39,658 --> 00:43:41,492
maybe go back to school.

829
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:44,954
Now I can't do anything.

830
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:47,248
- Well, maybe when her mother
recovers...

831
00:43:47,374 --> 00:43:49,083

who leaves his victims

then stuffs their insides
with money,

I don't know where he is.

And I found these

He's been hiding them,

he's not taking them.

- Is that your father?

I've been trying
to get him to move,

And they'll poison my body.

01:18:23,824 --> 01:18:25,074
- Get out of my bedroom.

1328
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:26,575
- Who is this girl?

1329
01:18:26,702 --> 01:18:27,660
- Mona Gray.

1330
01:18:27,786 --> 01:18:29,995
- Mona Gray,
will you please get out?

1331
01:18:30,122 --> 01:18:32,331
- Should I call the police?
- No.

1332
01:18:32,457 --> 01:18:35,251
- But you need your numbers.

1333
01:18:35,377 --> 01:18:36,502
How are you gonna know

1334
01:18:36,628 --> 01:18:38,295
how you feel or who you are
without them?

1335
01:18:38,422 --> 01:18:40,965
- Andrea, I'll be right back.

1336
01:18:41,091 --> 01:18:42,091
I'm sorry.

1337
01:18:46,596 --> 01:18:50,349
- So why don't you need
your numbers anymore?

1338
01:18:50,475 --> 01:18:51,600
- Why do you care?

1339
01:18:51,727 --> 01:18:54,770
- I care because
you're the reason I love math.

1340
01:18:54,896 --> 01:18:56,605
You taught me
numbers were everything.

1341
01:18:56,732 --> 01:18:57,940
And I noticed your numbers,

1342
01:18:58,066 --> 01:18:59,775
and I used to keep
a vertical bar graph

1343
01:18:59,901 --> 01:19:02,737
measuring them
against your moods.

1344
01:19:04,406 --> 01:19:06,949
- You made a graph?

1345
01:19:11,997 --> 01:19:13,706
Would you like to sit?

1346
01:19:15,834 --> 01:19:19,545
I left the store open,
I sold my car,

1347
01:19:19,671 --> 01:19:21,547
all because of 42.

1348
01:19:23,717 --> 01:19:25,551
Who gives a damn
about anything else

1349
01:19:25,677 --> 01:19:28,679
when you're wearing a 42?

1350
01:19:28,805 --> 01:19:30,556
- I saw you that day.

1351
01:19:30,682 --> 01:19:31,974
- A marvelous day,

1352
01:19:32,100 --> 01:19:34,810
the tops I've ever been.

1353
01:19:34,936 --> 01:19:37,938
- How did you get to be 42?

1354
01:19:40,609 --> 01:19:45,780
- And I realized if I don't have
to be a number,

1355
01:19:45,906 --> 01:19:48,282
I can be anything.

1356
01:19:52,162 --> 01:19:55,873
I don't understand
why you're suddenly interested.

1357
01:19:55,999 --> 01:19:58,501
You were the meanest
little girl I ever knew.

1358
01:19:58,627 --> 01:20:01,629
You egged my car
every Halloween.

1359
01:20:01,755 --> 01:20:02,671
- [Chuckles]

1360
01:20:02,798 --> 01:20:04,006
You knew that was me?

1361
01:20:04,132 --> 01:20:05,758
- Of course.

1362
01:20:05,884 --> 01:20:11,764
What I don't know
was why you would do that.

1363
01:20:14,976 --> 01:20:17,853
- Because you ignored me.

1364
01:20:17,979 --> 01:20:20,397
And you ignored my father.

1365
01:20:23,777 --> 01:20:25,694
- What?

1366
01:20:25,821 --> 01:20:28,781
- You never asked
about him once.

1367
01:20:28,907 --> 01:20:30,783
- Yes, I did.

1368
01:20:30,909 --> 01:20:33,369
- No, you didn't.

1369
01:20:33,495 --> 01:20:38,499
- One day, you were...
you were playing in the yard,

1370
01:20:38,625 --> 01:20:42,670
and I asked you
what happened to your dad.

1371
01:20:42,796 --> 01:20:44,672
He seems faded.

1372
01:20:47,300 --> 01:20:50,177
- Uh-uh.
- I did! I most certainly did.

1373
01:20:50,303 --> 01:20:52,012
You were standing right there

1374
01:20:52,138 --> 01:20:54,682
wearing your green rubber boots,

1375
01:20:54,808 --> 01:20:56,934
throwing rocks at that tree.

1376
01:20:57,060 --> 01:21:00,062
I asked about your dad,
and you said to me,

1377
01:21:00,188 --> 01:21:01,856
"Shut up, Mr. Jones."

1378
01:21:37,809 --> 01:21:39,768
I should have asked you again.

1379
01:21:42,355 --> 01:21:43,772
I'm sorry.

1380
01:21:46,276 --> 01:21:50,821
Maybe that day,
you just weren't yourself.

1381
01:21:56,661 --> 01:22:00,247
- I don't think
I've ever been myself.

1382
01:22:04,961 --> 01:22:07,880
- So what is wrong
with your dad?

1383
01:22:11,092 --> 01:22:14,637
- He thinks he's about to die.

1384
01:22:14,763 --> 01:22:18,474
- Do you think
he's about to die?

1385
01:22:38,036 --> 01:22:39,787
- Do you miss running?

1386
01:22:48,004 --> 01:22:51,215
Do you want to know
how I hurt my leg?

1387
01:22:51,341 --> 01:22:53,258
You never asked.

1388
01:22:53,385 --> 01:22:54,426
- I'm sorry.

1389
01:22:54,552 --> 01:22:56,303
I've been thinking about

1390
01:22:56,429 --> 01:23:00,516
cutting another shape of health
into the backyard

1391
01:23:00,642 --> 01:23:02,851
but this time
with a larger radius,

1392
01:23:02,978 --> 01:23:04,561
because the last one
was too small,

1393
01:23:04,688 --> 01:23:08,524
but I'm thinking about trying
one with a bigger range.

1394
01:23:12,028 --> 01:23:14,405
What do you think?

1395
01:23:14,531 --> 01:23:18,993
- I don't think I can
keep you company anymore.

1396
01:23:19,119 --> 01:23:20,953
- My beautiful child.

1397
01:23:21,079 --> 01:23:22,329
It's perfectly fine with me

1398
01:23:22,455 --> 01:23:24,289
if you just want
to wait in the car.

I thought it was
a little wordy.

1404

- I didn't know
what else to say.

1405
01:24:24,350 --> 01:24:29,271
- Lisa insisted that I
come see you.

- How is she?

I will be
your bathroom monitor.

a bathroom monitor.

- You don't?

1423

I didn't mean
to just barge in like that.

against Ann DiGanno's family
as well as the school district.

You could be looking
at a large settlement.

only one thing I want.

in exchange for your job back,
