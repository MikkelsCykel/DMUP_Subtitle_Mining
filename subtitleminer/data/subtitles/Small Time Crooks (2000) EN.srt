I'm looking for a box of chocolates.
Something fancy, if you have it.

13
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:29,600
- Is it for a gift?
- Yeah. I want something fancy...

14
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:34,340
and not too rich because she tends
to put on a little blubber, the wife.

15
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:36,350
- Uh-huh.
- Around the thighs.

16
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:39,680
What about this one?
It's really nice. It's kind of rich.

17
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:42,220
- It's from Belgium.
- From Belgium?

18
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:44,220
- It's very pretty.
- Yeah.

- I'm watching Princess Diana.

23
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,430
Not again! How many times
you gonna do that?

24
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,440
Look at those clothes.

25
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:06,410
I told you time and again,
she got all that stuff discount.

buy retail? It's a known...

- here, I got you some chocolates.
- Chocolates?

28
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,710
You heard of chocolates?
I got you chocolates.

29
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:21,810
- How come?
- What do you mean, "how come?"

30
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:25,090
These are from Belgium.
They're handmade by "Belgiumites. "

Tell it to the marines!
You're up to something.

You get caught
hitting on a waitress?

33
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:34,600
In 25 years of marriage,
have I ever hit on anybody but you?

34
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:38,330
I don't buy it, Ray.
You got a scheme. You got a scheme!

35
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:41,240
Forget it! Get me dinner.
They're not for you.

36
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:43,800
- I got you nothing. Just get me dinner.
- Fine.

37
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:47,650
I want my dinner right now,
and hurry up.

38
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:50,550
Before you make dinner,
I gotta talk to you about something.

<i>What did I tell you?
Here comes the commercial.</i>

40
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:57,620
<i>- Frenchy, I need our 6,000 bucks.
- What?</i>

41
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:01,130
<i>- I gotta have our six G's.
- That's our whole savings.</i>

42
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,360
- Don't get dramatic about it.
- Ray, six G's. That's all we got, right?

43
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,230
I got a brilliant idea.
I'm gonna make us rich.

44
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:10,900
How you gonna make us rich?
Rob a bank?

45
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:12,460
How'd you know that?
How'd you guess that?

46
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:13,870
What?

47
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:16,340
First shot out of the box,
you got it.

48
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:19,810
Is that why Tommy Beal's coming over?
And Denny?

49
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,610
What would you say
if I told you...

50
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:25,420
that you were married
to a very brilliant man?

51
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:29,820
- I'd say I'd have to be a bigamist.
- This is foolproof.

52
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:32,050
You told me you were finished
with that life.

53
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:34,150
I've been finished with it.
But look at me.

54
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:36,390
I kick around
from stupid job to job.

55
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:39,560
- You like the way we're living?
- It beats your former residence.

56
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:42,370
Think I like spending our anniversary
staring at you through glass,

57
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,370
talking over a phone?

58
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:48,470
Frenchy, you stood by me.
Granted, you stood by me.

59
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:52,040
Two years in the joint I waited for you.
And what did I get for it?

60
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:55,570
You got Belgian chocolates.
What's wrong with that?

61
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:59,110
God, I've got an idea
and this is so incredible.

62
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:04,530
But we need seed money for this plan.
We need 18,000 bucks.

63
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:08,390
Denny's kickin' in six, Tommy's kickin'
in six, and I gotta put in my six.

64
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:10,210
- Where are those bums
gonna get that kind of stake?

65
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:11,370
They're not bums.

66
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:13,370
- Maybe they didn't go to harvard.
- Harvard?

67
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,430
They never completed kindergarten
because they were drafted.

68
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:18,440
<i>You're such a snob, Frenchy.</i>

69
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:21,600
<i>For God's sakes! Denny's not
stupid 'cause he drives a truck.</i>

70
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,650
No, he's stupid because he has
a low I.Q. Come on, out of the way.

71
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:27,810
- Oh, I'd like to just flatten you once!
- Oh, yeah.

72
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,880
Tommy's got street smarts.

73
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:31,650

77
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:41,950
I got my end.
I told you I could match you.

78
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:44,730
<i>You overmatched him.
He can't get his end.</i>

79
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,890
Frenchy,
I've gotta have that money!

80
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:49,870
For a heist? Pass. Maybe
if you needed a quadruple bypass.

81
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:53,500
- This is a brilliant thing!
- No, Ray really is a genius!

82
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:57,210
- Compared to you this chair is a genius.
- This is a plan of a great mind.

83
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:01,380
This is precise, mathematical. It's hard
to believe you're just a dishwasher.

84
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:03,390
Thank you.

85
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:07,010
I don't get your "agreeance" on this, I
count to three, there's gonna be trouble.

86
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:11,290
You can count to 53! I did a lot of
nails for that money, and it's all we got.

87
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,380
- That's what you want to
do all your life? Nails?

88
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,730
Take a hike, okay?

89
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,530
- I'm telling you, I'm countin'.
- Oh, yeah?

90
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,400
- If I lose it, you're gone.
- Oh, I'm quaking in my panty hose.

91
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:24,530
<i>- [Doorbell Buzzing]
- You're embarrassing me in front of my friends.</i>

92
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:26,540
- Who said you could have my cookies?
- I can't have a cookie?

93
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:29,080
<i>- [Tommy] What's up?
- Did you get your share?</i>

94
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:32,010
My share of what?
Yeah, I got it. I sold some stuff.

95
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,020
<i>- [Denny] What'd you sell?
- A rented car.</i>

96
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,520
<i>- He can't get his end. She won't give it to him.
- I can get my end!</i>

97
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:40,320
The candy didn't work? You said you'd
have her eatin' out of your hand.

98
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:42,320
Will you shut up?

99
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:45,950
All that's missing from this guy
is a piece of velvet and a pet mouse.

100
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:48,120
Frenchy, gimme the money.

101
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,790
I wouldn't invest our last six thou
if you had a legit idea...

102
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:54,200
much less something that's gonna land
the three of you jerks back in stir.

103
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:57,070
You said you called the shots
around here.

104
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:59,070
Will you knock it off!

105
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:01,770
Frenchy, that money's mine.

106
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:04,540
It's mine. I earned it,
and I'm saving it for an emergency.

107
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:07,080
- But I'm your husband.
- Oh, take a hike.

108
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:10,280
Frenchy,
I'm gonna get violent!

109
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:12,950
Please! With your hernia?

110
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:15,820
Fellas, I can't do it.
It's over. Forget it.

111
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:17,830
You said you're the boss.

112
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:21,260
Stop telling me what I said,
for crying out loud!

113
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:25,060
It's over. Let the bank lay there.
Let someone else do it.

114
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:28,230
- I gotta get some air. I'm going up on the roof.
- Don't jump!

115
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:32,430
- You're too valuable as a dishwasher.
- Ah, knock it off!

116
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:34,530
<i>- Frenchy, can I have another cookie?
- No!</i>

117
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:35,970
I want one.

118
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,980
[Sighs]
All right, tell me your idea.

119
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:50,350
I told you my idea.
You shot it down.

120
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:53,950
- You gonna tell me, or are you gonna have a tantrum?
- For God's sakes!

121
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:57,890
For some reason you're always
shooting down my dreams.

122
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,260
Because you get
the kind of dreams people get...

123
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:02,270
after putting opium
in their brownies.

124
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:05,200
Can I for one minute
tell you about this bank?

125
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:07,200
You're not a bank robber.

126
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:09,260
You got a two-year mandatory
vacation that proved that.

127
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:12,280
What I'm not is a stickup man.
That's all we proved.

128
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:16,110
When I hit that bank that time,
we were inexperienced.

129
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:19,120
The whole group of us
put on rubber masks.

130
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:21,380
They were all Ronald Reagan masks.
It was confusing.

131
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:23,390
I didn't know who was who.

132
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:25,720
<i>You're lucky your lawyer
knew the judge.</i>

133
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:28,090
Can I please tell you
my idea, Frenchy?

134
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:32,650
<i>[Ray's Voice] I noticed a few weeks
ago, a couple doors down from the bank,</i>

135
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:34,930
<i>there's a pizza joint
that folded.</i>

136
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,270
<i>A little hole in the wall. And it's
for rent, Frenchy. It's for rent.</i>

137
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:43,530
Then it hits me.
And, believe me, I'm no genius.

138
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:45,700
You don't have to sell me.

139
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:48,680
What I figure is,
we tunnel under.

140
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:52,550
We take the pizza joint, tunnel under,
we come up under the vault of the bank.

141
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:56,310
I know the layout 'cause I used to
know a guard. I got diagrams!

142
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:59,080
We clean out the vault,
we go to Florida.

143
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,420
Ray, we're poor
but we're happy, ain't we?

144
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:04,220
We're not happy.
You're always complaining.

145

Are you happy doing cuticles? Is that
the way you want to spend your life?

146
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:12,770
My mother told me. She said, " Don't get
involved with a guy from the rackets. "

147
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:16,970
What's wrong with you? We had dreams.
I don't know what's gotten into you.

148
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,170
- Did we not have dreams when I first met you?
- Yeah.

149
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,440
Yes, granted, I was in the rackets.
I was running numbers.

150

You were an exotic dancer. We fell
in love, your parents didn't approve.

151

I tried to go legit. I couldn't
make a go of the pet cemetery.

152

What do you want me to do?
But, but...

That's where you come in.
You front the place.

156
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:48,300
- What?
- You front it. You make pizzas.

157
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:50,310
With what?
I can't cook pizzas.

158
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:52,600
Cook cookies!
What's the difference?

159
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:57,310
Or you tell fortunes. You look like
a Gypsy. Or make it a travel agency.

160
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:01,110
You work there, and we'll
tunnel under into the bank.

161
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:03,590
- God.
- Frenchy, come here, come here.

162
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:05,710
- See this? See how beautiful this is?
- Yeah.

163
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:08,920
See what you're seeing there?
It's not just New Jersey.

164
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:13,450
When we first met, there was a sunset
just like this. Remember that?

165
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:17,730
Yeah. In New Jersey. But in Columbia
there was an earthquake.

166
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,930
Sorry, but the location
was taken by someone else.

167
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:22,440
What?

168
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:26,910
They made a deal yesterday.
I told you, if you waited too long...

169
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:30,340
Who did?
Who took the place?

170
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:32,610
Gimme...
You got the name?

171
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:35,210
Mrs. Nettie Goldberg.

172
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:37,480
Jesus! For what?

173
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:39,920
I believe a flower shop.

174

A flower shop!
[Sighs]

175
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,900
It's a little old lady.

176
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:49,830
Her husband died, and she wants to
make the joint into a flower shop.

177
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:53,200
- That don't make no difference. Somebody's got to get to her.
- To get to her and what?

178
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:55,400
Beg her, con her, trick her.

179

<i>[Tommy] I'm gonna go
to her shop and threaten her.</i>

180

- Don't do that.

181
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:04,110
- I gotta figure a way to talk to her.
- And say what?

182
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:06,950
If her husband just died, what
are you gonna say? You need a plan.

183
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:08,450
Right.

184
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:11,250
I gotta figure something.
I'll charm her.

185
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:15,280
- What are you gonna use for charm?
- Knock it off. We're serious.

186
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,690
Some master plan.
You don't even have the lease.

I'm gonna get the lease.
That's what this is about.

The cookies,
they're 85 cents.

290

- Just relax. You're a perfect fit.

291
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:58,660
- Where the hell are the sandbags?
- Just relax!

292
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:02,870
Okay, so we got off
to a shaky start.

293
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:04,870
Yeah,
I'd say it was shaky.

No question about it. So what?</i>

<i>Don't worry. You're gonna get yours,
Frenchy. I promise you.</i>

You're gonna be fine. This time,
a month or two, we'll be in Miami.

300
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:27,630
It'll be great.

301
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:30,490
A patron of the arts.
Doesn't that sound great?

302

- Frenchy...
- Opening night at the opera.

I love you.

all the time, you stand by me.

You know when I first knew
I loved you?

This was a long time ago.

Remember I taught you how to open
a safe by moving the tumblers?

And you got it.

309
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:53,880
You're a very romantic man.
And I'm a lucky woman...

- Right, so it don't make no noise.
- This is efficiency.

- He puts it in the bag.
- It's call efficiency, my friend.

318
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:20,480

- I'm trying to figure this out.

I think, according to this,
we're supposed to take a left turn.

That doesn't mean stop.
Let's go.

Will you give me...
What the hell are you doing?

- You've got your hat on backwards.

328
00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:49,240
So?

329
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:52,280
"So?" The flashlight
goes in the front.

330
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:54,280
It looks cooler like this.

331
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:56,650
Are you a jerk?
What do you mean it looks cooler?

332
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,980
It's more stylish than that.
Look at that.

333
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:02,420
- You think so?
- Yeah. Turn it around.

334

This is chic like this.
Look at that. That's cool.

- I don't got a mirror. That looks good.

How much is my share?

343
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:35,850
I figure it's gotta be
two million, right?

00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:38,120
I'm countin' the jewelry

- What about Frenchy? She's just a front.

347
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:48,030
But without Frenchy we're dead.

348
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:51,200
We can get any broad
to sell cookies. Jeez.

349
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:53,930
I say she gets a share,
but not a full share.

350
00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:55,980
I'd go for that.

351
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:59,480
What if we each get a fourth
and she gets like a third?

when they're diggin'
for gold in the mountains?

They find the gold
and they all get rich.

Then this guy goes nuts and he turns on
his friends. Let's not let that happen here.

Hey, wait a minute.
You know what we could do?

380
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:30,630
We could hire May and
not tell her what we're doin'.

381

'Cause she'll never catch on.
She's got, you know... And, and...

382
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:39,040
- We're making enough dough from the cookies to pay her.
- Absolutely!

383
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:43,140
We give her a small salary. She'll never
figure out or catch wise to anything.

00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,730
for what some people are calling the
most fabulous cookie treat in New York.

433
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,740
What the hell is goin' on here?

434
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:22,140
And you are the heart and soul
of Sunset Cookies.

435
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:24,840
- Miss, uh...
- Frenchy Winkler.

436
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:27,880
My real name's Frances
but everybody calls me Frenchy.

437
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:30,040
As one stands here,
one can inhale the aroma...

438
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,950
My God!
[Laughing]

439
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:36,580
Of hot chocolate, cinnamon, fresh cherries
and a dozen other mouthwatering taste treats.

440
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:41,020
Is it true customers wait on line
for half an hour for a single cookie?

441
00:25:41,090 --> 00:25:44,690
- That you've had to ration sales?
- Yeah, it happened like once.

442
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:47,360
But what're you making
all the fuss about?

443
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:50,300
Tell us. Where did you learn
the rare secret of your baking?

444
00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:52,670
Well, I don't know.
It's the only thing I can cook.

445
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:55,670
- That and linguini with turkey meatballs.
- [Laughing]

446
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:58,800
Sir, how would you describe
your cookie?

447
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,370
Oh, I don't know.
It's baked with nutmeg or something.

448
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:06,750
<i>- I just know it's great.
- And I just want to say that we're expanding.</i>

449
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:10,080
- There are men in the back now tunneling...
- No, no, May! Get back...

450
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:15,220
<i>I can't take this, Frenchy.
We don't want this kind of attention.</i>

451
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:18,790
<i>Don't look at me! I didn't hire
a publicity agent. They just showed up!</i>

452
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:21,560
I know, but it's really
putting us in the toilet.

453
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:25,570
I can't concentrate. There's people
up there. Demanding cookies every day.

454
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:29,540
And today Denny got bit by a rat.
We had to give him rabies shots.

455
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:32,240
- Who, the rat?
- Very funny. You should be on TV.

456
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:34,710
I am! Open your eyes!

457
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:38,980
- Frenchy, I don't like this.
- Come on! You've been digging for weeks!

458
00:26:39,050 --> 00:26:41,540
When you gonna get somewhere?
How much longer is it gonna take?

459
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:44,680
It's complicated!
We keep getting lost.

460
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:47,220
The other day I was deep
in the tunnel, my hat went out.

461
00:26:47,290 --> 00:26:49,590
- That stupid coal miner's hat?
- That's right.

462
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:52,190
It's a lifesaver, that hat.
That bulb.

463
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:56,830
We'd have done better just with
a cookie store. We're making good dough.

464
00:26:56,900 --> 00:27:00,500
"Making good dough. " It's
a cookie store, but we're making dough.

465
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:02,970
That's very... It's a cookie store.
We're making dough...

466
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,240
I get it, I get it.

467
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:38,870
[Benny] I knew we were going
the wrong way. I knew it!

468
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:41,970
- What the hell we doin' in a dress shop?
- Your fault, you got the maps.

469
00:27:42,050 --> 00:27:44,950
At least it's a Sunday. We can
patch this up and get out of here.

470
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:47,650
- How we gonna patch it up?
- We tile it and we get out.

471
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,910
- Hello! I'm not a tiler.
- We don't have any tiles.

472
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:52,650
Where do you get cement
in the middle of a dress shop?

473
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:57,060
<i>Besides, Brain, how are we going
to close the hole and tile it?</i>

474
00:27:57,130 --> 00:28:00,830
We're inside the store.
How do we get out?

475
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:04,530
Well, you tile... he's got a point.
You can't tile this from the other side.

476
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,540
- No kidding.
- No, you can't.

477
00:28:06,610 --> 00:28:09,130
This is very discouraging, guys.

478
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:12,470
<i>- I'm ready to pack this in.
- Everybody freeze!</i>

479
00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:19,320
Hey, Ray, your wife's cousin
talks too much.

480
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:21,650
Sorry to spoil
your expansion plans, fellas.

481
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,650
<i>[Ray]
Officer, listen to me.</i>

482
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:28,130
We didn't do anything yet. Yes,
it's true, we were gonna rob the bank.

483
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:32,130
But we screwed up everything,
except for the cookie shop.

484
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:35,720
The cookie shop's doing great
for some reason. You like the cookies.

485
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:40,530
Let us forget everything we were gonna
do and concentrate on the cookie store.

486
00:28:40,610 --> 00:28:44,470
Look, I'm not here trying to ruin
anybody's life, okay?

487
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:46,740
Then give us a break.

488
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:49,580
Think I could get
a little piece of the action?

489
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:52,480
Yeah. I'm not opposed
to paying off the cops.

490
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:54,540
It's a standard
business expense.

491
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:57,780
<i>That's the thing. I don't want you
to think of it as a payoff.</i>

492
00:28:57,860 --> 00:29:00,590
<i>I think I'm qualified
to make what I believe...</i>

493
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:03,290
is a major contribution
to this enterprise.

494
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,560
My brother-in-law
majored in business.

495
00:29:05,630 --> 00:29:07,830
Let us hear this contribution,
all right?

496
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:12,100
- One word.
- Yeah? And that word is?

497
00:29:13,370 --> 00:29:15,310
Franchise.

498
00:29:22,890 --> 00:29:24,890
<i>[Ray]
We got about 600 trucks.</i>

499
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:30,300
<i>And, you know,
we're all over the country, and Canada.</i>

500
00:29:30,370 --> 00:29:34,430
<i>We make a lot of different cookies. Whatever
you want. We got pistachio, pretzels.</i>

501
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:38,600
<i>We make chicken chip cookies,
tuna mint.</i>

502
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:41,580
<i>[TVNewsman] Virtually overnight,
the Winklers and their associates...</i>

503
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:45,550
<i>have gone from a small, modest
mom and pop cookie shop...</i>

504
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:48,240
<i>to something approaching
a baking empire.</i>

505
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:51,290
This is where
we package everything.

506
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:54,020
And what we do is...

507
00:29:54,090 --> 00:29:57,460
The cookies have
a wonderful smell, a fresh smell.

508
00:29:57,530 --> 00:30:01,260
And that's all put on with
a chemical spray. We do that over here.

509
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:04,360
There's no denying that he's
refreshingly down to Earth...

510
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,490
for a corporate executive.

511
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:08,700
So offbeat, in fact,
that Sunset Farms...

512
00:30:08,770 --> 00:30:12,400
has captured the imagination
of the public and the industry.

513
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,910
We wanted to find out
what the competition thinks.

514
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:18,310
So we went to Paul Milton
of American Cookies.

515
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:21,320
The bottom line is,
they make a really great product.

516
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:25,380
You have what the public wants, and
everything else takes care of itself.

517
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:29,220
- This is your office?
- This is pretty much where I operate.

518
00:30:29,290 --> 00:30:31,820
Frenchy decorated this place.
You can tell.

519
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:34,630
She's got, uh,
all her stuff here.

520
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:37,830
This is an antique,
you know.

521
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:42,270
She says it's, like,
Louis XIV or Louis XV.

522
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:45,830
It's, uh... I don't know how high
the Louises go, actually.

523
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:48,900
But it's a top Louis.
It's one of the...

524
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:53,540
Frenchy stuck a TV in it,
you know, because she's got a creative...

525
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:56,180
- She's a creative decorator.
- It's very original.

526
00:30:56,250 --> 00:31:00,310
- Um, how much are you worth?
- Oh, plenty, plenty.

527
00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:03,160
- I mean, how much? Just between you and me.
- A lot.

528
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:06,530
We're worth a lot of dough.
Whatever you see is antiques.

529
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:09,070
This thing here.
This if from...

530
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:12,800
I don't remember exactly. It think it's the
Renaissance or the Magna Carta or something.

531
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:14,800
But that's where it's from.

532
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:18,000
Why did you decide to go
into baking so late in life?

533
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:21,370
Well, Frenchy, we found out,
can make cookies.

534
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:23,380
<i>[Newsman]
The Frenchy they're talking about,</i>

535
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:26,080
<i>- and reigning culinary genius of Sunset,
- hello.</i>

536
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:29,920
<i>Is Frances Fox, who happens
to be the wife of the C.E. O.</i>

537
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:31,920
<i>So you made cookies
your whole life,</i>

538
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:34,360
<i>and everybody told you
how delicious they were.</i>

539
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:37,120
<i>- Yeah. I thought they were "B.S. Ing" me, you know?
- Really?</i>

540
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:40,990
Yeah. Somebody gives you something they
cooked, you always say you enjoyed it...

541
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:45,300
even if it makes you throw up
afterwards, so, you know...

542
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:48,930
In a day and age where everyone seems
to have public relations handlers,

543
00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:51,270
it's hard to imagine
a corporate brain trust...

544
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:55,610
that is more direct and less image conscious
than the group here at Sunset Farms.

545
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:59,620
In fact, each person we met seemed
to be more eccentric than the last.

546
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,810
Like Tommy Walker,
the chairman of the board.

547
00:32:01,890 --> 00:32:05,790
Frenchy makes the best cookies in the
world. We're very proud of her cookies.

548
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:08,480
<i>What are your duties
as chairman of the board?</i>

549
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:13,000
The board meets once or twice a week,
and we take up important issues.

550
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:15,230
<i>- Issues?
- Yeah. Facts, problems.</i>

551
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:17,230
Things like that.
Normal stuff.

552
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:20,960
What kind of problems does an overnight
success like Sunset Farms face?

553
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:24,970
What kind of problems? Last week the
toilet on the fourth floor wouldn't flush.

554
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:28,100
It flushed, but the water
kept coming to the top.

555
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:31,010
So the board voted
on getting a plumber.

556
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:35,450
One of the architects of Sunset Farms's
unorthodox marketing strategy...

557
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:39,580
is the head of advertising, Denny Doyle,
a former truck driver.

558
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:42,630
Was it you who came up with
the idea to advertise baked goods...

559
00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:45,090
<i>in Playboy, Penthouse
and Hustler Magazine?</i>

560
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:48,560
I figured if a guy's staring
at a naked piece of tail,

561
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:51,860
and he sees the breasts and legs,
he's gonna start to salivate.

562
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:54,460
It's human nature.
So if he's salivating,

563
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:56,700
he turns the page and
comes across a picture of, say,

564
00:32:56,770 --> 00:32:58,710
our pistachio cream cookies.

565
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:01,900
He thinks maybe that's why
he's drooling. You understand?

566
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,910
It's psychology.
It's science.

567
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:08,150
It's like Pablo's Theory, you know,
with the dog when he feeds him?

568
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:10,850
<i>- Pablo?
- Pablo, with the dogs.</i>

569
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:13,520
<i>[Newsman] Then there's
ex-police officer Ken Deloach,</i>

570
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:16,390
<i>vice president
in charge of distribution.</i>

571
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:20,490
<i>And Benjamin Borkowski, vice president
in charge of plant safety.</i>

572
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:23,660
First thing I did was make sure
the building was fireproof.

573
00:33:23,730 --> 00:33:27,170
<i>[Newsman] And lest they be accused
of being a mostly male club,</i>

574
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:31,680
<i>May Sloan is in charge of public
relations and also physical therapy.</i>

575
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:34,140
<i>I understand
public relations.</i>

576
00:33:34,210 --> 00:33:36,510
<i>But physical therapy?</i>

577
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:39,610
All the chocolate chips
are put in the cookies by hand.

578
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:45,020
And that's really hard on the back
and leg muscles. I do deep massage.

579
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:48,180
By the way,
she's also a vice president.

580
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:51,130
So there you have it. A brief glimpse
into a corporate culture...

581
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,650
that has industry leaders and management
analysts all over the country...

582
00:33:54,730 --> 00:33:59,670
scratching their heads, trying to figure
out what Sunset Farms might try next.

583
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:04,470
It may be as simple as what Paul Milton,
the Winklers' chief competitor said:

584
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:07,240
"If you've got something
the American public wants,

585
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:09,440
everything else
falls into place. "

586
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:11,780
Or as we in television
might say,

587
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:14,410
"There's no accounting
for the public's taste. "

588
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:23,820
Okay, keep coming through
with this stuff.

589
00:34:23,890 --> 00:34:25,830
It's better the way I had it.

590
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:28,520
Darling, could you put the doll
by the ceramic zebra?

591
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,530
<i>- [Man] Mrs. Winkler? Excuse me.
- Yes?</i>

592
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,540
<i>- You wanted to check the menu.
- Right.</i>

593
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:35,630
Stevens, could you bring that piece
downstairs that Mr. Winkler hates?

594
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:37,940
Try it again
next to the fireplace.

595
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:40,440
I want a lot of nuts
and "crude-ites. "

596
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:43,310
What did we say for openers?
Oh, yes. Snails.

597
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:46,320
Escargots, yes.
Then the potato and truffle salad.

598
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:49,440
Yes. Truffles, by all means.
But I hate those thin pieces.

599
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:52,490
When you shave it, go, go.
Lay it on big time.

600
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:55,420
Truffles are always shaved
really finely.

601
00:34:55,490 --> 00:34:58,480
<i>- Naturally, I didn't mean to suggest anything overdone.
- Right.</i>

602
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:01,400
<i>[Chef] Then we have
poached sea bass in phyllo.</i>

603
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:05,160
<i>And spinach souffle,
and salad, and dessert.</i>

604
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:09,170
- Oh, and finger bowls.
- There's nothing being served that requires finger bowls.

605
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:12,900
Well have 'em, 'cause you can never predict
whose fingers will need a washing. Okay?

606
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:16,610
<i>- Did you rearrange this place again?
- All right, hold your water.</i>

607
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,610
Don't tell me to hold my water.

608
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:20,840
Every night it's like walking
into a strange house.

609
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:23,440
What is this thing?
Did I tell you to get rid of this?

610
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:26,010
It's a harp.
You got no flair, Ray.

611
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:28,920
Don't tell me I got no flair.
Nobody plays the harp.

612
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:31,330
What's it doing in
the middle of the living room?

613
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,730
I like the visual sweep.

614
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:36,820
I don't know what's
gotten into your head.

615
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:38,840
You're so hoity-toity
all of a sudden.

616
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:42,810
My cookies pay for this,
so turn it off.

617
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:44,810
What's for dinner?

618
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:48,140
And don't tell me it's sparrows
on a bed of lettuce again.

619
00:35:48,210 --> 00:35:51,010
'Cause I wouldn't care if I had anything
on a bed of lettuce anymore.

620
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:54,480
- They're pheasants, and you ate 'em last week.
- And I got BB's.

621
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:57,380
Remember I got BB's in the mouth?
I almost choked on a BB.

622
00:35:57,450 --> 00:36:00,150
Can I get a cheeseburger?
Is that possible?

623
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:02,160
It's the dinner party tonight!

624
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:04,960
Oh! Great!

625
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:08,050
- Just when I got a lot on my mind.
- Your mind don't hold a lot.

626
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:10,670
Get dressed.
And don't forget, it's tuxedo.

627
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:14,710
- I'm hungry. I don't wanna get dressed now.
- You want a snail?

628
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:17,150
You nuts?
I'm gonna have a snail?

629
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:19,190
Come on! You eat steamers.

630
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:23,190
A snail leaves a trail of scum
in the yard when it walks.

631
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:25,820
- Not in France they don't.
- Oh, Jesus.

632
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:30,060
What happened to the turkey meatballs
and spaghetti? That's what I like.

633
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:34,270
Have a potato and truffle thing.
That'll hold you till the company comes.

634
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:37,330
I don't want truffles.
Truffles got no flavor!

635
00:36:37,410 --> 00:36:40,810
They're subtle.
Only pigs can find them.

636
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:44,040
You're thinking of pearls. They come
in oysters. That's what that is.

637
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:46,050
<i>Take a hike.</i>

638
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:49,090
You're such an ignoramus.
That's what I love about you.

639
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:52,780
- Pearls come in oysters.
- Ray, Ray, Ray.

640
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:57,060
- Please, don't spoil my big night.
- What's so big about tonight?

641
00:36:57,130 --> 00:36:59,060
There's important people
coming from the arts,

642
00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:00,830
and I want to get on
some of those boards.

643
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:03,770
Hey, we donate,
you'll be on the boards.

644
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:07,800
- But I wanna be a patron.
- What you wanna be is a socialite.

645
00:37:07,870 --> 00:37:10,270
<i>So what?
Is that so terrible?</i>

646
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:13,540
You know, when we talked about
making it, we were gonna hit it big,

647
00:37:13,610 --> 00:37:17,380
move to Florida, we were gonna swim,
eat stone crabs.

648
00:37:17,450 --> 00:37:19,850
Well, we can get a place
at Palm Beach.

649
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:23,480
Palm Beach is ritzy.
I wanna go to Miami.

650
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:25,990
I wanna be at the dog track
every day.

651
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:29,260
I just know I wanna be
as far away from Frenchy Fox,

652
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:31,520
the topless wonder,
as I can be.

653
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:34,830
Hey, you were beautiful
as Frenchy Fox.

654
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:37,340
You'd come out.
Remember "Night Train"?

655
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:41,030
- You'd give it a little of this, a little of that.
- Those days are over, Ray.

656
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:44,700
Our accountants want us to expand.
We're gonna be twice as big next year.

657
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:49,110
What good is being twice as big if I can't
get a cheeseburger? What's it all mean?

658
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:51,740
Ray, please,
be charming tonight.

659
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:56,020
I've seen you when you want
to turn on the charm. You sparkle.

660
00:37:56,090 --> 00:37:58,580
All right?
[Chuckles]

661
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:00,180
<i>I gotta go take a shower.</i>

662

<i>§[Classical]</i>

663
00:38:12,910 --> 00:38:17,040
Good evening. Good evening.
Welcome to our humble abode.

664
00:38:17,110 --> 00:38:21,100
- Charles Bailey. This is my wife Emily.
- How you doin'?

665
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:24,210
- David Perret.
- Linda Rhinelander.

666
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:28,380
- Can I get you drinks?
- Just some Evian. Unless you have Perrier?

667
00:38:28,450 --> 00:38:30,950
- Certainly.
- We got anything you want. Whatever you want, you can have.

668
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:34,690
I usually take tap water 'cause the
fluoride keeps your teeth from rotting.

669
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:38,560
Otherwise, they'll drop right out
on you, honey. Hey, look at this!

670
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:40,570
Hello!

671
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:43,930
So glad you could attend
our humble abode.

672
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,270
<i>We just got back from Caneel Bay.
Didn't want to miss the new Traviata.</i>

673
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:49,970
- Have you seen it?
- No, not yet.

674
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:52,510
Nor have I.
Exactly what is it?

675
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:55,670
Ray, why are we standing around
in the hallway?

676
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:59,580
Please, let's retire
to the living room.

677
00:38:59,650 --> 00:39:03,180
I gather you're a big fan
of the ballet, Mrs. Winkler.

678
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:05,820
- Her? Are you kiddin'?
- I used to be a dancer.

679
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:10,120
Please, call me French...
Uh, Frances. Frances Fox Winkler.

680
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,130
The Foxes from Saratoga?

681
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:14,500
I don't know.
I never checked my pedigree.

682
00:39:14,570 --> 00:39:18,370
- [Laughing]
- Can we change the music, please?

683
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:22,000
- I feel like I should be wearing a wig.
- You will in a couple years.

684
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:24,010
Did you do the place yourself?

685
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:26,740
Yes. They say I have a flair
for decorating.

686
00:39:26,810 --> 00:39:29,370
- You know, this rug lights up?
- It lights?

687
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:32,250
Yeah. It's made of what?
The fiber optics.

688
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,250
I'll turn it on later.

<i>- Stevens, what's with the snails?
- [Doorbells Rings]</i>

Oh, why don't I get
the, the...

691
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:43,290
And you show them
your collection of leather pigs.

692
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:45,300
Right. Go.

693
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:49,560
- Do you play the harp, Frances?
- Oh, no. It's a visual, honey.

694
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:52,730
The sweep kills me.
Oh, finally. Girls.

695
00:39:54,910 --> 00:39:57,340
Hey, how you doin'?
Come on in.

696
00:39:57,410 --> 00:39:59,810
Hold it. Right there.
All the action... hey, honey.

They're in the other room.

- What?
- Garth Steinway.

700
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:10,590
- I'm Anthony Gwynne.
- On, no kidding?

701
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:14,180
Tony Gwynne,
the outfielder with the Padres?

702
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:17,200
Our goal is to raise
$2 million by April.

703
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:19,560
Then the company can tour the West Coast
and include the new opera,

704
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:22,260
<i>- which has gotten such good notices.
- Right.</i>

705
00:40:22,330 --> 00:40:25,570
Count me in.
I love serious music.

706
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:29,230
Ray, on the other hand,
opera freaks him. [Laughs]

707
00:40:29,310 --> 00:40:31,940
Have you tried your finger bowl?

708
00:40:32,010 --> 00:40:35,570
The guy says to him,
"What do you do for a living?"

709
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:37,910
He says, "I'm a momback. "

710
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:40,140
"What's a momback?"

711
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:45,420
He says, "I stand behind a truck.
I say, momback, momback. "

712
00:40:45,490 --> 00:40:49,690
He stands behind the truck
and goes, "Momback, momback. "

713
00:40:51,630 --> 00:40:54,900
He says... I think
it's too fast for her.

714
00:40:54,970 --> 00:40:57,730
"Momback. "
He says, "Momback. "

715
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:01,400
I'm afraid I do think
they overpaid for the Picasso.

716
00:41:01,470 --> 00:41:05,040
For me it was unusually mediocre,
don't you think?

717
00:41:05,110 --> 00:41:07,050
- I agree completely.
- Banal.

718
00:41:07,110 --> 00:41:10,110
Excuse me.
I have to find my wife.

719
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:15,680
I saw a beautiful painting of fruit
at the, uh, Met or the Whitney.

720
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:17,980
It might have been
the holocaust.

721
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:22,260
- Are you affiliated with any of the museums?
- No, I'm a private dealer.

722
00:41:22,330 --> 00:41:24,520
Oh. We have
one or two paintings,

723
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:28,690
but I haven't really gotten around
to building a collection yet.

724
00:41:28,770 --> 00:41:32,530
Uh-huh. So what are you interested in?
What's your...

725
00:41:32,610 --> 00:41:36,740
Rembrandt. Picasso.
Michelangelo.

726
00:41:36,810 --> 00:41:39,870
- You know, the boys.
- Yeah, yeah.

727
00:41:39,950 --> 00:41:42,610
I might be out of Michelangelos
at the moment.

728
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:47,080
But I did recently come into possession
of an incredible Damon Dexter...

729
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:49,450
that someone's trying to sell.

730
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,680
I don't think
I'm aware of him.

731
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:54,990
No. Well, he's new,
you know.

732
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:59,790
I have to say, your wine
is absolutely delicious. Really.

733
00:41:59,870 --> 00:42:02,800
It was chosen by the same chef
who did the finger bowls.

734
00:42:02,870 --> 00:42:04,890
Have you rinsed?

735
00:42:04,970 --> 00:42:08,430
David used to be part owner
of a vineyard, so he's a tough audience.

736
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:13,080
Did you study art at school?

737
00:42:13,150 --> 00:42:18,340
No, I didn't. I often think
I should have. I studied literature.

738
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:21,820
Then inevitably wound up
as a stockbroker.

739
00:42:21,890 --> 00:42:25,850
Then I dropped out, went toJapan,
became a Buddhist, blah, blah, blah.

740
00:42:25,930 --> 00:42:29,360
And then, yeah, I did teach art
at Amherst for a bit.

741
00:42:29,430 --> 00:42:31,450
And then the vineyard.

742
00:42:31,530 --> 00:42:34,900
[Laughs] My God, what a life!
And you're still so young.

743
00:42:34,970 --> 00:42:37,160
Yes, well...
Don't let the face fool you.

744
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:40,300
Somewhere in a closet
there's a portrait of me aging.

745
00:42:40,370 --> 00:42:44,310
In the closet?
Why would it be in...

746
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:48,810
Oh! How droll.
[Laughs]

747
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:51,250
You hear about
the Polish car pool?

748
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:53,840
Every day
they'd meet at work.

749
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:57,220
- I can't believe this room.
- I don't know...

750
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:59,790
This takes bad taste
to new heights.

751
00:42:59,870 --> 00:43:03,300
<i>- [Emily] This is excruciating.
- [Charles Mumbling]</i>

752
00:43:03,370 --> 00:43:06,430
<i>[Charles] Can you believe the two
of them? I can't keep a straight face.</i>

753
00:43:06,510 --> 00:43:08,980
<i>[Garth] And what she's done
with this apartment?</i>

754
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:10,980
<i>The sheer flawless vulgarity
of it all!</i>

755
00:43:11,050 --> 00:43:13,340
<i>- [Emily] She must've been frightened by a leopard.
- [Charles] Don't knock it.</i>

756
00:43:13,410 --> 00:43:16,980
<i>They plan on being very generous,
and for that we must be thankful.</i>

757
00:43:17,050 --> 00:43:18,990
<i>[Garth] Really?
And what about the harp?</i>

758
00:43:19,050 --> 00:43:22,420
<i>- Not to mention the way she wears her clothes.
- The definition of bad taste.</i>

759
00:43:22,490 --> 00:43:24,650
<i>[Emily]
Oh, I'd say so.</i>

760
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,930
<i>[Ray]
I never saw so much jewelry.</i>

761
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:33,960
It makes me sad, Frenchy, that I don't
have to steal anymore. Really.

762
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:36,600
What's the matter?
You've been quiet all night.

763
00:43:36,670 --> 00:43:38,610
What is bothering you?

764
00:43:38,670 --> 00:43:41,870
<i>What's bothering me is
we got no class.</i>

765
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:44,570
Speak for yourself.
I was very charming tonight.

766
00:43:44,650 --> 00:43:46,770
I was killin' them
with jokes.

767
00:43:46,850 --> 00:43:50,220
I got a little drunk from the wine,
so I went to sit down in the bar.

768
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:52,510
Some of them were in there
talking about us.

769
00:43:52,590 --> 00:43:55,450
You should've heard 'em.
And they were right.

770
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:58,420
Stop it! We got more dough
than all of'em put together.

771
00:43:58,490 --> 00:44:02,020
Well, it ain't dough.
It's knowing the finer things.

772
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:04,030
<i>Like what? Opera?</i>

773
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:06,790
Like food and wine,
and painting, and books.

774
00:44:06,870 --> 00:44:09,670
Stop it, will ya?
I'm unimpressed.

775
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:13,000
All my life I've been ignorant.
I could never afford to learn anything.

776
00:44:13,070 --> 00:44:16,670
There was always some emergency,
and I was a good student.

777
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:20,910
I was a lousy student and I always
hated school. And I don't care about it.

778
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:23,510
If I could find my school principal
today, now that I got some dough,

779
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:25,880
I'd put a contract out on her.

780
00:44:25,950 --> 00:44:29,290
<i>Class is something
you can't fake and you can't buy.</i>

781
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:32,660
I got more class in my little finger
than they all got combined.

782
00:44:32,730 --> 00:44:36,660
No. We came into a couple of bucks,
but we're phonies.

783
00:44:36,730 --> 00:44:38,960
- We're trying to act like big shots.
- Not me!

784
00:44:39,030 --> 00:44:41,370
Well, me. But it's over.

785
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:44,670
The time has come to use our dough
to amount to something.

786
00:44:44,740 --> 00:44:48,140
- Like what?
- To change our lives.

787
00:44:48,210 --> 00:44:50,970
I'm too busy to change my life.

788
00:44:51,050 --> 00:44:53,510
Doin' what?
Playing pinball?

789
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:56,180
I don't wanna wear a tux anymore.
I don't like it.

790
00:44:56,250 --> 00:44:59,740
- I wanna go to Florida and swim.
- I wanna be the real thing!

791
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:03,190
And you better wise up, 'cause if I grow
and you stay as stupid as you are,

792
00:45:03,260 --> 00:45:06,590
we're gonna have
big problems, Ray.

793
00:45:15,970 --> 00:45:19,130
<i>- Smarten you up. Is that what you said?
- Yeah.</i>

794
00:45:19,210 --> 00:45:24,140
You said you were a teacher.
You know art, opera, books, wine.

795
00:45:24,210 --> 00:45:26,980
We wanna learn it all,
don't we, Ray?

796
00:45:27,050 --> 00:45:30,350
I'm incredibly flattered
that you'd think I was capable of...

797
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:33,980
Turning two slugs like us
into classy items? [Laughing]

798
00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:36,790
No homework. I'm not doing any.
I never did homework when I was young.

799
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:40,790
I'm not doing anything
that's got homework to it.

800
00:45:40,860 --> 00:45:44,590
Naturally, we would make it
very worth your while, David.

801
00:45:44,670 --> 00:45:48,730
No, it's absolutely not about money.
I suppose it's just...

802
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:51,830
I don't know. I've never been asked
to do anything like this before,

803
00:45:51,910 --> 00:45:54,140
and I'm not sure
I'd know where to start.

804
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:57,440
I know I gotta get
a better vocabulary.

805
00:45:57,510 --> 00:45:59,950
Have you ever thought about
enrolling in college?

806
00:46:00,010 --> 00:46:01,570
<i>College?</i>

807
00:46:01,650 --> 00:46:05,110
I didn't go to high school. What
the hell am I gonna go to college for?

808
00:46:05,190 --> 00:46:08,640
That takes four years.
We want a private crash course.

809
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:11,520
- Lessons in life. Right, Ray?
- Am I crazy?

810
00:46:11,590 --> 00:46:14,390
She's nuts.
Tell her she's nuts.

811
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:17,900
What? I'm gonna learn
about life suddenly?

812
00:46:17,970 --> 00:46:21,370
I must say, Frenchy,
Ray has a point.

813
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:26,840
He could probably teach me a lot more
about life than I could ever teach you.

814
00:46:26,910 --> 00:46:30,070
What the hell is he gonna teach you?
I can figure the point spread.

815
00:46:30,140 --> 00:46:33,810
- I know how to count cards at a blackjack table.
- Would you close your bazoo?

816
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:36,110
- I can count four jacks...
- Close your bazoo!

817
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:39,580
<i>I don't want to be discouraging because
what you're proposing is admirable.</i>

818
00:46:39,650 --> 00:46:41,590
<i>It's amazing.</i>

819
00:46:41,660 --> 00:46:45,060
The one thing I would like. I would like
to learn how to spell Connecticut.

820
00:46:45,130 --> 00:46:48,560
Don't ask me why.
I never knew how to spell Connecticut.

821
00:46:48,630 --> 00:46:52,690
<i>- Fair enough. Great! You could teach him that, right?
- Yeah.</i>

822
00:46:52,770 --> 00:46:56,260
I heard you telling somebody this
is a very slow period in the art market.

823
00:46:56,340 --> 00:46:58,570
And we would take
very good care of you, right?

824
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:00,570
<i>Like I say,</i>

825
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:04,440
I absolutely don't want
to discourage you.

826
00:47:04,510 --> 00:47:07,170
I suppose I just have to think
about it a bit. I haven't...

827
00:47:07,250 --> 00:47:10,680
If I could envisage a plan,
some kind of starting point...

828
00:47:10,750 --> 00:47:14,310
We could start by building
our art collection.

829
00:47:14,390 --> 00:47:18,190
That way you'd make a few bucks,
and we can learn something.

830
00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:20,820
But no museums.
I'm not goin' to museums.

831
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:23,330
The pictures...
spook me out.

832
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:27,490
- The virgins...
- [Laughing]

833
00:47:27,570 --> 00:47:30,370
- What are you laughin' at?
- Spooked by the virgins.

834
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:32,460
[Laughing]
I'm sorry.

835
00:47:32,540 --> 00:47:35,570
Work on the laugh, Frenchy.

836
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:39,040
<i>[David] So, you can see the difference
between this Tintoretto...</i>

837
00:47:39,110 --> 00:47:43,980
and the earlier Byzantine
painting we looked at.

838
00:47:44,050 --> 00:47:48,180
What would you say is the most
significant difference?

839
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:52,620
Me? I would say that
the frame's bigger here.

840
00:47:52,690 --> 00:47:55,560
Mm-hmm.
Well, it is bigger.

841
00:47:55,630 --> 00:48:00,070
But there's also a difference in
the paintings themselves, isn't there?

842
00:48:00,130 --> 00:48:03,100
And it's an important difference
because it characterizes...

843
00:48:03,170 --> 00:48:08,110
the great technical leap from
the ancient into the modern world.

844
00:48:08,180 --> 00:48:11,840
You remember how those saints
had very flat faces...

845
00:48:11,910 --> 00:48:14,680
and the background was
on the same plane as the foreground?

846
00:48:14,750 --> 00:48:18,210
- Perspective.
- Right, perspective. That's it.

847
00:48:18,290 --> 00:48:23,220
Let me show you another
very good example of that.

848
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:29,190
"The frame on this one is bigger"?
Boy, you are a dummy.

849
00:48:29,260 --> 00:48:33,890
Don't give me "perspective. "
Take a hike. Take a hike.

harryJames the trumpeter.

863
00:49:20,050 --> 00:49:21,980
HenryJames married to Grable.

864
00:49:22,050 --> 00:49:24,750
- HenryJames, the author. Yeah?
- Oh.

865
00:49:24,820 --> 00:49:28,350
This is where he lived
and where he worked, and...

866
00:49:28,420 --> 00:49:31,320
Where did he eat? I'm hungry.
I don't care where he lived.

867
00:49:31,390 --> 00:49:34,830
<i>I remember.
The Hair-ess, right?</i>

868
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:38,560
- The "h" is silent.
- Oh, did he write that too?

869
00:49:42,190 --> 00:49:45,690
Oh, gee.
Frenchy, I'm still sick.

870
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:48,790
I'm weak. I'm weak.
I can't go.

871
00:49:48,870 --> 00:49:52,430
You're gonna miss a very interesting
"Great Books" discussion.

872
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:55,200
I know. It kills me.
It just kills me.

873
00:49:55,270 --> 00:49:59,340
But I'm just gonna lay here.
I'll see you when you come back.

874
00:50:14,990 --> 00:50:17,830
- How are you?
- Hello.

875
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:20,460
Ray's got a cold.

876
00:50:22,270 --> 00:50:24,530
- I bet 500.
- Five hundred?

877
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:28,200
- See your five, raise you 500.
- I'm outta here.

878
00:50:28,270 --> 00:50:31,370
I see the five...
and a thou.

879
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:33,640
What'd you think
of the book?

880
00:50:33,710 --> 00:50:37,440
Well, I thought
it was very romantic.

881
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:42,080
I mean, he loved her
but their backgrounds were so different.

882
00:50:42,150 --> 00:50:46,720
Right. So, what? You thought
he was doomed from the start?

883
00:50:46,790 --> 00:50:48,820
I guess,
'cause he wound up dead.

884
00:50:48,890 --> 00:50:54,530
But, uh, I think that two people from
different backgrounds can make it...

885
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:58,470
if, uh, the juice is there.

886
00:50:58,540 --> 00:51:03,170
- Right. Sorry. Juice is...
- You know, the hots.

887
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:05,900
Right.

888
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:07,910
Wine.
Would you like some wine?

889
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:11,280
I brought over a bottle
of Chateau Margaux.

890
00:51:11,350 --> 00:51:14,510
<i>Ah, that's brilliant, because we can
compare that to my Clos de la Roche...</i>

891
00:51:14,590 --> 00:51:18,040
and you can see the difference
between a Bordeaux and a Burgundy.

892
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:21,020
I've got two other Burgundies
of the same vintage...

893
00:51:21,090 --> 00:51:23,560
that I thought might be fun
for us to try.

894
00:51:23,630 --> 00:51:26,790
I'll see your five
and raise you a thou.

895
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:31,570
I'll see it and
raise you a thousand more.

896
00:51:32,970 --> 00:51:35,740
And a thousand.

897
00:51:35,810 --> 00:51:38,240
<i>- And a thousand.
- Okay. Call.</i>

898
00:51:38,310 --> 00:51:40,900
<i>Read 'em and weep.
Apair of threes.</i>

899
00:51:40,980 --> 00:51:44,180
Oh, good.
I thought you were bluffing.

900
00:51:44,250 --> 00:51:46,410
What do you want
to play now?

901
00:51:46,490 --> 00:51:49,180
What about Indian poker?

902
00:51:49,250 --> 00:51:51,810
Seven cards.
You hold your cards over your head.

903
00:51:51,890 --> 00:51:54,620
Nobody sees their hand.
We bet on each other's hand.

904
00:51:54,690 --> 00:51:58,030
High-low, maybe some wild cards.
All the reds.

905
00:51:58,100 --> 00:52:00,030
Wanna sit down, May?

906
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:03,070
<i>[Benny] How about Old Maid?
Do you play Old Maid?</i>

907
00:52:03,140 --> 00:52:06,590
So, um... try this one.

908
00:52:06,670 --> 00:52:08,610
Okay.

909
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:13,940
[Sniffs]
Nice nose.

910
00:52:14,010 --> 00:52:16,070
Yeah. The bouquet
is very special.

911
00:52:16,150 --> 00:52:19,610
No, no. I mean
you got a nice nose.

912
00:52:19,690 --> 00:52:22,650
- Me?
- [Giggling] Yeah.

913
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:25,950
I don't know how to describe it.
It's like, kinda...

914
00:52:26,020 --> 00:52:29,650
- It's just any old nose, I think.
- Aquiline.

915
00:52:29,730 --> 00:52:34,430
Um, talking of which,
how is your vocabulary coming along?

916
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:38,660
Oh, very good. I'm almost through
all the "A" words in the dictionary.

917
00:52:38,740 --> 00:52:42,800
Right, right. The thing is,
I'm not 100 percent convinced...

918
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:47,310
that memorizing the dictionary is
the best way to improve your vocabulary.

919
00:52:47,380 --> 00:52:49,400
Hmm.

920
00:52:51,450 --> 00:52:54,890
<i>[Man] I can't believe you found
a buyer for the Damon Dexter so fast.</i>

921
00:52:54,950 --> 00:52:58,650
<i>And at such a good price. It'll really
take a bite out of our debts.</i>

922
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:03,590
Oliver, it's dawning on me that
the opportunity has arisen...

923
00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:07,290
for me to become
quite obscenely rich.

924
00:53:07,370 --> 00:53:09,430
How serious are they about
building an art collection?

925
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:11,440
That would be peanuts.

926
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:13,870
What, then?

927
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:16,460
Well, I think that she
might be falling for me.

928
00:53:16,540 --> 00:53:18,480
Frenchy Winkler?

929
00:53:18,540 --> 00:53:21,670
How much do you think
she's worth, roughly?

930
00:53:21,750 --> 00:53:24,840
- Her husband you mean.
- No, it's all in her name.

931
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:27,350
She's the cookie mogul.

932
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:31,910
- What are you saying?
- I don't know. I suppose I'm saying...

933
00:53:31,990 --> 00:53:35,520
people grow
and marriages sadly break up.

934
00:53:35,590 --> 00:53:38,390
And women remarry,
you know?

935
00:53:38,460 --> 00:53:42,420
Fortunes,
they change hands.

936
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:47,130
<i>- What is this?
- It's a Damon Dexter, a discovery of David's.</i>

937
00:53:47,210 --> 00:53:49,170
<i>I say it's depressing.</i>

938
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:52,680
Knock it off. You wouldn't know
a masterpiece if it bit you in the ass.

939
00:53:52,740 --> 00:53:56,310
- I refuse to look at this, Frenchy.
- What is that supposed to mean?

940
00:53:56,380 --> 00:54:00,110
It means as long as this is on
that wall, I don't look at that wall.

941
00:54:00,190 --> 00:54:03,420
- You're a head case!
- I'll bet David made a big profit on this.

942
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:06,080
Hey, whose cookies
pay the rent, huh?

943
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:08,960
I think he's making a fool outta you.
Stevens, come here.

944
00:54:09,030 --> 00:54:12,120
Tell me what time it is.
I no longer look at this wall.

945
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:15,060
- 11:00 a. m., sir.
- Thank you very much.

946
00:54:27,350 --> 00:54:32,680
- David, what's this?
- Oh, well, that's a citrine necklace.

947
00:54:32,750 --> 00:54:34,690
- You know about citrines?
- No.

948
00:54:34,750 --> 00:54:37,020
They're not one of
the precious stones.

949
00:54:37,090 --> 00:54:40,080
But the luster's always been considered
very special and unique.

950
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:42,960
- And that? Look!
- Ah, yeah.

951
00:54:43,030 --> 00:54:45,360
Well, if we're talking
about luster,

952
00:54:45,430 --> 00:54:49,890
this is something very special
and I'd imagine very, very expensive.

953
00:54:49,970 --> 00:54:53,900
<i>It's a cigarette case encrusted with
diamonds that belonged to the Duke of Windsor.</i>

954
00:54:53,970 --> 00:54:57,070
- I know the Duke of Windsor!
- Yeah?

955
00:54:57,140 --> 00:55:00,370
He also married
beneath his station, right?

956
00:55:00,450 --> 00:55:03,380
- He did, like our friend henry higgins.
- Yeah, yeah.

957
00:55:03,450 --> 00:55:05,510
Oh, my God,
the Duke and Duchess.

958
00:55:05,580 --> 00:55:08,350
It was such a romantic story.
I saw it on television.

959
00:55:08,420 --> 00:55:09,850
Uh-huh?

960
00:55:22,370 --> 00:55:25,200
Ray? Ray!

961
00:55:25,270 --> 00:55:27,570
What are you doin' here?

962
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:32,440
I'm havin' Chinese food. That's what
they serve in a Chinese restaurant.

963
00:55:32,510 --> 00:55:34,500
You want some company?

964
00:55:34,580 --> 00:55:36,010
Who?

965
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:38,810
What do you mean?
Me. Who's talkin' to you?

966
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:40,820
Well, where's Frenchy?

967
00:55:40,890 --> 00:55:43,720
Frenchy's at some piano concert
with a guy.

968
00:55:43,790 --> 00:55:46,310
Oh. Well, they...

969
00:55:46,390 --> 00:55:49,830
They have takeout here, but I don't
think they'll deliver to a concert.

970
00:55:49,900 --> 00:55:51,890
Don't worry about it, May.
Frenchy'll eat.

Dinner was so great! You know?

973
00:56:09,730 --> 00:56:14,360
All that M.S.G. And the grease.
It was... What a treat!

974
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:17,930
I'm so sick of continental food
every night.

975
00:56:18,010 --> 00:56:20,640
Frenchy eats frogs' legs!

976
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:23,810
- It's supposed to taste like chicken.
- Rabbit.

977
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:28,250
- Rabbit tastes like frogs' legs?
- No. Forget it.

978
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:31,010
Are you happy being rich?

979
00:56:31,090 --> 00:56:35,860
It's okay. I got a lot of charge
accounts and a really nice apartment.

980
00:56:35,930 --> 00:56:39,120
I got a maid.
I'm still a little lonely, though.

981
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:41,130
Yeah? How come?

982
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:43,130
That guy I was seeing left me...

983
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:45,930
because he just was
so embarrassed about being poor.

984
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,130
And he hated that I'd pay
for everything.

985
00:56:48,210 --> 00:56:51,970
So then I stopped paying.
And actually, that's when he left me.

986
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:56,340
- I can understand your...
- You enjoy being rich?

987
00:56:56,410 --> 00:56:58,350
- I hate it!
- You're kidding?

988
00:56:58,420 --> 00:57:01,280
No, I hate it. I'm telling you.
I hate the life.

989
00:57:01,350 --> 00:57:04,750
- And it's causin' me to lose Frenchy.
- What do you mean?

990
00:57:04,820 --> 00:57:07,920
I mean, she's outgrowing me.
That's just what she said.

991
00:57:07,990 --> 00:57:10,050
She's like
a different person now.

992
00:57:10,130 --> 00:57:13,030
I think she's developing a crush
on her teacher David.

993
00:57:13,100 --> 00:57:15,960
Yeah. Well, you know,
he's very good-looking,

994
00:57:16,030 --> 00:57:19,800
and he's bright and very charming
and very elegant.

995
00:57:19,870 --> 00:57:22,360
Okay, May, I got the picture.
It's all right.

996
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:25,430
You know, my God, you really know
how to make a guy feel good.

997
00:57:25,510 --> 00:57:29,470
- Well, when you're right, you're right.
- Thank you.

998
00:57:29,550 --> 00:57:31,670
<i>[David]
What did you think of her playing?</i>

999
00:57:31,750 --> 00:57:35,550
I just gotta tell ya, I thought
the whole evening was apocalyptic.

1000
00:57:35,620 --> 00:57:39,110
- Apocalyptic? Really?
- Yes! I really was agog.

1001
00:57:39,190 --> 00:57:41,250
Well, me too.
I mean, she's fabulous.

1002
00:57:41,330 --> 00:57:46,660
She's fabulous and I have to
asseverate, she deserves accolades.

1003
00:57:46,730 --> 00:57:50,190
- Frances, you've been memorizing the dictionary.
- Yeah, I got the "A's. "

1004
00:57:50,270 --> 00:57:52,200
Next week the "B's. "
Right?

1005
00:57:52,270 --> 00:57:54,640
How do I look?

1006
00:57:54,710 --> 00:57:58,540
I have to say that that dress
is just... gorgeous on you.

1007
00:57:58,610 --> 00:58:01,810
See? Your influence.
Low key, right?

1008
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:04,580
That's a very
flattering thing to say.

1009
00:58:04,650 --> 00:58:08,520
<i>- Ray thinks it's dullsville.
- [Woman] David?</i>

1010
00:58:08,590 --> 00:58:11,550
<i>- Page!
- Wasn't her choice of the Rachmaninoff inspired?</i>

1011
00:58:11,620 --> 00:58:15,460
- Wasn't it? We loved it.
- At first I thought it might incur my animadversion.

1012
00:58:15,530 --> 00:58:20,550
- But soon I realized it was apposite.
- Aha, I think I see drinks.

1013
00:58:20,630 --> 00:58:23,830
- Good to see you, David.
- Nice meeting you.

1014
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:26,460
<i>- [David] Thank you very much.
- I love your friends, David.</i>

1015
00:58:26,540 --> 00:58:30,560
They're so bright and cultured
and refined. It's another world.

1016
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:33,770
Well, it's a world
I know you'd love to belong to.

1017
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:36,840
- Ah, this looks a lot more civilized.
- Beautiful.

1018
00:58:36,910 --> 00:58:39,510
Let's take a seat over here.

1019
00:58:39,580 --> 00:58:43,610
Anything we get,
Cody's in for his full share.

1020
00:58:43,690 --> 00:58:45,780
That's how it is.

1021
00:58:45,860 --> 00:58:49,260
<i>- [May] You know why I respect CodyJarrett?
- Why?</i>

1022
00:58:49,330 --> 00:58:53,230
<i>- Because he loves his mother.
- I can understand that, May.</i>

1023
00:58:53,300 --> 00:58:56,660
<i>Because even though he's a vicious,
coldblooded, psychopathic killer,</i>

1024
00:58:56,730 --> 00:58:59,630
and she encourages him,
still it's sweet.

1025
00:58:59,700 --> 00:59:02,040
Yeah, has a sweetness.
I wish I had a mother like that.

1026
00:59:02,110 --> 00:59:04,570
- More Pepsi?
- Yeah, please.

1027
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:08,980
And this is the best part, isn't it?
I love this part.

1028
00:59:09,050 --> 00:59:11,710
Will you pass me
the CrackerJack?

1029
00:59:14,580 --> 00:59:17,110
What is it?
What are you looking at?

1030
00:59:17,190 --> 00:59:20,850
I happen to be noticing you. I was
looking at you a couple of times tonight,

1031
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:23,520
'cause for the first time
I had the thought...

1032
00:59:23,590 --> 00:59:28,790
that in a very strange way,
you got a sweet face.

1033
00:59:28,870 --> 00:59:32,630
It's offbeat, you know,
in a kind of bizarre, you know...

1034
00:59:32,700 --> 00:59:37,730
It's... I don't know how to explain it
exactly, but it's right up there.

1035
00:59:37,810 --> 00:59:39,740
What do you mean?

1036
00:59:39,810 --> 00:59:42,780
I mean it as a compliment.
I'm sayin' a nice thing to you.

1037
00:59:42,850 --> 00:59:45,180
'Cause you being a relative
of Frenchy,

1038
00:59:45,250 --> 00:59:50,120
I never before classified you as a,
you know, a human-type female, so...

1039
00:59:50,190 --> 00:59:52,120
I was married.

1040
00:59:52,190 --> 00:59:54,210
I know, I know.
This was a long time ago, right?

1041
00:59:54,290 --> 00:59:56,450
It was a really tragic story.

1042
00:59:56,530 --> 00:59:58,890
My husband, Otto,
was dyslexic,

1043
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:01,830
and the only thing he could
spell correctly was his name.

1044
01:00:01,900 --> 01:00:04,960
Oh! That is... That's...

1045
01:00:07,300 --> 01:00:10,030
There's no doubt about it.
The Burgundy really goes to my head.

1046
01:00:10,110 --> 01:00:13,300
- [Chuckles] Yeah.
- What did you want to talk to me about?

1047
01:00:14,950 --> 01:00:19,610
I've, um, I've got
a little present for you.

1048
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:22,050
- For me?
- Yeah. Here.

1049
01:00:22,120 --> 01:00:26,890
Ohh! Pretty!
I love leather books.

1050
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:30,790
<i>Oh, Pygmalion!
I love that story, David.</i>

1051
01:00:30,860 --> 01:00:33,090
There's, um...
You see a little inscription there?

1052
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:37,220
"To my favorite Eliza, from your
Professor higgins. Love, David. "

1053
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:40,460
- Gee, I got a confession to make.
- What?

1054
01:00:40,540 --> 01:00:42,440
I got you a present too.

1055
01:00:42,510 --> 01:00:44,840
Oh, no. Oh, no.
No, you didn't have to do that.

1056
01:00:44,910 --> 01:00:48,340
It's in appreciation of all the stuff
you've been doin' for me,

1057
01:00:48,410 --> 01:00:51,280
- 'cause I know it's a hard job.
- Oh, my God!

1058
01:00:51,350 --> 01:00:54,080
Oh, my God! Frenchy!
This is...

1059
01:00:54,150 --> 01:00:57,590
- Frances!
- Frances, this is...

1060
01:00:57,650 --> 01:01:00,950
It must've cost you a fortune.

1061
01:01:01,020 --> 01:01:03,960
What good's having dough
unless you spend it, huh?

1062
01:01:04,030 --> 01:01:07,660
Well, I know,
but this is so extravagant.

1063
01:01:07,730 --> 01:01:09,820
I'm embarrassed.

1064
01:01:09,900 --> 01:01:12,430
I'm not suggesting you take up smoking,
but I figured, you know,

1065
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:15,560
what's good enough
for the Duke of Windsor, right?

1066
01:01:15,640 --> 01:01:17,800
Well, I'm really overwhelmed.

1067
01:01:17,870 --> 01:01:20,340
And I feel, you know,
my little pathetic Bernard Shaw...

1068
01:01:20,410 --> 01:01:23,310
- is so insignificant by comparison to this.
- No!

1069
01:01:23,380 --> 01:01:27,040
But you see,
I just wanted you to know...

1070
01:01:27,120 --> 01:01:30,610
- how unbelievably proud I am of you.
- This is not insignificant.

1071
01:01:30,690 --> 01:01:35,280
Maybe I'm talking out
of turn here, but...

1072
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:40,560
you've just developed so much,
and I just feel, you know,

1073
01:01:40,630 --> 01:01:44,690
you belong in a world
of society and high culture now.

1074
01:01:44,770 --> 01:01:47,900
It's frustrating, because you
should continue growing, you know.

1075
01:01:47,970 --> 01:01:50,670
You should be branching out,
you should be traveling.

1076
01:01:50,740 --> 01:01:55,140
There's Paris and Rome and the great
opera houses and the museums, you know.

1077
01:01:55,210 --> 01:01:59,550
You should be in a position
to cultivate the right kinds of friends.

1078
01:01:59,620 --> 01:02:02,410
Anyway, I'm, you know, bif.

1079
01:02:02,490 --> 01:02:05,050
It's hard, you know,
'cause Ray's not like that.

1080
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:09,020
He likes to watch TV
in his underwear, suckin' a Bud.

1081
01:02:09,090 --> 01:02:14,220
Yeah. Well, that... I don't know
what to say. I can't comment on that.

1082
01:02:15,870 --> 01:02:19,700
- Can I be frank, David?
- Mm-hmm.

1083
01:02:19,770 --> 01:02:23,500
[Sighs]
Sometimes I think I've outgrown him.

1084
01:02:38,590 --> 01:02:42,290
- Pretty late.
- Yeah, you too. What did you do?

1085
01:02:42,360 --> 01:02:45,260
I, you know, I worked late...

1086
01:02:45,330 --> 01:02:48,790
and then May and me
had some Chinese food.

1087
01:02:48,870 --> 01:02:51,630
You and May! What'd you talk about
over dinner? Cartoons?

1088
01:02:51,700 --> 01:02:54,330
Are you kiddin'?
We went up to her apartment.

1089
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:57,070
<i>- We watched White Heat on television.
- Till 3:00 a. m.?</i>

1090
01:02:57,140 --> 01:02:59,510
No. Then we went out
and we got a pizza.

1091
01:02:59,580 --> 01:03:01,740
Chinese food and a pizza?

1092
01:03:01,810 --> 01:03:03,750
With your stomach,
I'm surprised you weren't shot...

1093
01:03:03,810 --> 01:03:05,840
breaking into
the Pepto-Bismol factory.

1094
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:09,940
<i>No, Frenchy, I had fun. It was the first
time in a long time I had a good time.</i>

1095
01:03:11,720 --> 01:03:14,590
- I want to talk to you, Ray.
- Now?

1096
01:03:14,660 --> 01:03:16,680
David's going over
to Europe for a month.

1097
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:19,920
I thought we might go along,
see some sights.

1098
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,930
What kind of sights?

1099
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:25,430
<i>You know, churches,
opera houses, ruins.</i>

1100
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:27,440
What are you, a stroke victim?

1101
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:30,340
I'm gonna fly 3,000 miles
to see opera houses and ruins?

1102
01:03:30,410 --> 01:03:33,140
- Well, I wanna go.
- What do you mean, you wanna go?

1103
01:03:33,210 --> 01:03:36,410
- It's part of my cultural development.
- Will you knock it off?

1104
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:39,410
You're Frenchy Fox from New Jersey.
Stop puttin' on airs.

1105
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:41,750
David thinks that it would be good
for me to travel through Europe.

1106
01:03:41,820 --> 01:03:43,750
<i>I get a bad vibe about this guy.</i>

1107
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:46,290
Because you're a crook,
so you think everybody is.

1108
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:49,660
<i>I wish I still was a crook, then
I'd feel like an actual person again.</i>

1109
01:03:49,730 --> 01:03:52,720
I warned you that this would happen
if you didn't grow along with me.

1110
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:57,030
The only thing that's grown about you is
your rear end from too much French food.

1111
01:03:57,100 --> 01:03:59,470
I'm sorry, Ray,
but I wanna go to Europe.

1112
01:03:59,540 --> 01:04:03,370
What do you mean? We're married.
You can't just go to Europe with David.

1113
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:05,370
<i>I asked you to come.</i>

1114
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:08,100
'Cause you knew I'd say no.
That's why you asked me.

1115
01:04:08,180 --> 01:04:12,510
My idea of fun is not goin' to operas
and ruins. I get enough sleep at home.

1116
01:04:12,580 --> 01:04:14,610
<i>I never thought I'd be
saying this to you, Ray,</i>

1117
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:18,250
but maybe the time has come
to reevaluate our marriage.

1118
01:04:18,320 --> 01:04:20,260
<i>If you go to Europe
with David,</i>

1119
01:04:20,320 --> 01:04:22,290
you're gonna have
to reevaluate it big time.

1120
01:04:22,360 --> 01:04:24,690
I'm going! I won't be
held back mentally...

1121
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:26,920
by some overaged
juvenile delinquent.

1122
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:30,830
<i>- Then you better go get yourself a lawyer.
- We don't need lawyers.</i>

1123
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:34,200
I'll go fifty-fifty with you
even though it's all in my name.

1124
01:04:34,270 --> 01:04:37,000
You're right. We don't need lawyers.
Exactly right, because...

1125
01:04:37,070 --> 01:04:39,130
You don't have to go fifty-fifty.
I don't want anything.

1126
01:04:39,210 --> 01:04:43,150
You can have the house, the business,
custody of all the chocolate chips.

1127
01:04:43,210 --> 01:04:45,440
I just want out.

1128
01:05:20,510 --> 01:05:24,540
[Ray] You know, May, it was on a boat
that I first proposed to Frenchy.

1129
01:05:24,620 --> 01:05:26,550
[May]
Yeah, I know.

1130
01:05:26,620 --> 01:05:30,280
All of a sudden, I'm not her type
after all these years.

1131
01:05:30,350 --> 01:05:34,880
- May I tell you something?
- What?

1132
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:37,320
You're not my type either.

1133
01:05:37,390 --> 01:05:40,450
What does that mean?
What the hell does that mean?

1134
01:05:40,530 --> 01:05:42,690
It means that maybe Frenchy...

1135
01:05:42,770 --> 01:05:45,290
wasn't so wrong to try
and make something out of herself.

1136
01:05:45,370 --> 01:05:49,100
- Frenchy was nuts! Frenchy overdid everything.
- You underdo everything!

1137
01:05:49,170 --> 01:05:53,440
You know, there's more to life
than turkey meatballs.

1138
01:05:53,510 --> 01:05:57,310
I don't know what to say, May.
I get a bad vibe about this guy, David.

1139
01:05:57,380 --> 01:06:00,610
It's my street instinct,
but I just don't trust him.

1140
01:06:00,680 --> 01:06:02,620
Yeah, I know why.

1141
01:06:02,690 --> 01:06:05,710
Because he's younger than you are,
handsomer than you are,

1142
01:06:05,790 --> 01:06:09,380
he's much taller than you are,
he's smarter than you are,

1143
01:06:09,460 --> 01:06:11,390
he's much more exciting
than you are...

1144
01:06:11,460 --> 01:06:15,800
May, don't feel obligated to pull
any punches with me. I can take it.

1145
01:06:15,870 --> 01:06:21,270
You know, women like a little elegance.
It's more romantic.

1146
01:06:21,340 --> 01:06:24,870
So if I had it to do over again,
I would do some things differently.

1147
01:06:24,940 --> 01:06:28,170
Maybe I'd sit through a couple
of more operas with Frenchy,

1148
01:06:28,250 --> 01:06:31,740
especially now since they got
the new Sony Walkmans.

1149
01:06:31,820 --> 01:06:35,550
Now that you split up with Frenchy,
you don't even work.

1150
01:06:35,620 --> 01:06:40,060
No, I don't work, May,
but I got an idea for something,

1151
01:06:40,120 --> 01:06:42,590
and I wanna talk to you
about it.

1152
01:06:42,660 --> 01:06:44,990
Really?

1153
01:06:55,410 --> 01:06:57,600
<i>[May]
Wow! What a place!</i>

1154
01:06:57,670 --> 01:07:00,010
That's the home of Chi Chi Potter,
the socialite.

1155
01:07:00,080 --> 01:07:02,240
Chi Chi Valezquez Potter.

1156
01:07:02,310 --> 01:07:04,470
Now, Chi Chi's got a necklace.

1157
01:07:04,550 --> 01:07:08,480
It's all emeralds with diamonds
around it. It's a very famous necklace.

1158
01:07:08,550 --> 01:07:11,250
Maybe you saw it in a magazine.
They photograph it all the time.

1159
01:07:11,320 --> 01:07:14,980
- Would it have been on television?
- L-I don't know.

1160
01:07:15,060 --> 01:07:18,520
But it's been in magazines. It's
a famous necklace. I wanna go in there.

1161
01:07:18,600 --> 01:07:22,330
I could live off that necklace
if I fence it for the rest of my life.

1162
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:25,390
But you gotta remember what happened
when you tunneled into the bank.

1163
01:07:25,470 --> 01:07:28,770
But that's the beauty part.
We don't have to tunnel anymore.

1164
01:07:28,840 --> 01:07:31,870
Now, Frenchy and I,
we're patrons of the arts.

1165
01:07:31,940 --> 01:07:35,070
So Chi Chi invited us to a big party
there in a couple of weeks.

1166
01:07:35,150 --> 01:07:39,010
Frenchy's out of town.
You come with me, we get the necklace.

1167
01:07:39,080 --> 01:07:41,920
Oh, uh, see, I never
heisted anything before.

1168
01:07:41,990 --> 01:07:44,180
There's nothing to it.
I know where the safe is.

1169

<i>[Ray's Voice] Because this
has been on my mind for a while.</i>

1170

and I excused myself.</i>

1171
01:07:49,230 --> 01:07:52,630
<i>I was very crafty. I went upstairs,
and I checked out the place.</i>

1172
01:07:52,700 --> 01:07:55,290
<i>I scoped it all out,
and I found the safe.</i>

1173
01:07:55,370 --> 01:08:00,860
<i>I got the whole layout in my mind
up there, so I know we can do this.</i>

1174
01:08:23,530 --> 01:08:27,430
I don't wanna wind up in jail. If this
is... Wait. If this is such a big item,

1175
01:08:27,500 --> 01:08:30,800
then they're gonna be turning the town
upside down looking for it.

1176
01:08:30,870 --> 01:08:34,200
No. That's why you're dealing with
a particularly shrewd mentality.

1177
01:08:34,270 --> 01:08:36,260
I got a connection
in Chinatown.

1178
01:08:36,340 --> 01:08:39,900
I bring in a picture that I got
from a magazine of the necklace.

1179
01:08:39,980 --> 01:08:42,840
He makes me an exact duplicate.
I switch.

1180
01:08:42,910 --> 01:08:44,880
She never knows what happened.
She's, you know...

1181
01:08:44,950 --> 01:08:49,080
Chi Chi's a dumb, flighty
society dame. She's crazy.

1182
01:08:49,150 --> 01:08:53,110
By the time she figures out there's a
switch, two years from now or something,

1183
01:08:53,190 --> 01:08:55,660
I'll be in Florida
or The Cayman Islands.

- Quite a substantial loan.
- Get to the point.

<i>What did you say?</i>

1247
01:13:01,030 --> 01:13:03,290
Suddenly it turns out
I got people I owe.

1248
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:06,200

01:16:22,130 --> 01:16:24,890
<i>- Do you play golf?
- Golf? No.</i>

1294
01:16:24,970 --> 01:16:27,160
I was just gonna make
a phone call upstairs.

1295
01:16:27,230 --> 01:16:32,470
- I guess I was misdirected.
- Yes, well, I was gonna use the phone.

1296
01:16:32,540 --> 01:16:36,340
I'm sorry. I wanted a match on Sunday,
but I'll get somebody else.

1297
01:16:36,410 --> 01:16:38,640
I would've looked
forward to it.

1298
01:18:05,430 --> 01:18:09,390
There'll be rain over the tristate area
and increasing fog.

1299
01:18:09,470 --> 01:18:13,410
Temperatures will hover
in the low 60s till Tuesday.

1300
01:18:13,470 --> 01:18:17,740
[Chuckling]
I must say, you are most amusing.

1301
01:18:17,810 --> 01:18:20,470
Would you like a canape?
Those are shrimp.

1302
01:18:20,550 --> 01:18:23,310
These are quail eggs.

1303
01:18:23,380 --> 01:18:25,320
I don't have any idea
what they are.

1304
01:18:25,390 --> 01:18:29,950
Thank you. I hate anything with
a toothpick. They lodge in your throat.

1305
01:18:30,020 --> 01:18:34,460
I'm George Blint, mutual funds.
And you?

1306
01:18:34,530 --> 01:18:37,860
May Sloan. I'm a lookout.

1307
01:18:37,930 --> 01:18:42,390
I noticed the way you walked and
carried yourself from across the room.

1308
01:18:42,470 --> 01:18:46,410
You remind me of my wonderful,
departed wife.

1309
01:18:46,470 --> 01:18:51,710
You can't carry yourself across
the room. That's physically impossible.

1310
01:18:51,780 --> 01:18:54,870
[Laughing]
You're charming.

1311
01:18:54,950 --> 01:18:59,180
You're the first woman I've met since
helen died that I could say that about.

1312
01:18:59,250 --> 01:19:02,620
Was helen your wife,
or just a woman who died?

1313
01:19:09,630 --> 01:19:12,660
Hi. Where's Mr. Winkler?
I want to talk to him.

1314
01:19:12,730 --> 01:19:15,060
Oh, he's around mingling.

1315
01:19:15,140 --> 01:19:19,540
Cloudy today, wasn't it? With a chance
of light sprinkles followed by sunshine.

1316
01:19:19,610 --> 01:19:22,940
Right. Chi Chi, would you get
those photographs from the bedroom?

1317
01:19:23,010 --> 01:19:26,270
I wanna show Mr. Winkler the property in
Aspen where we're gonna build the theater.

1318
01:19:26,350 --> 01:19:28,640
Yes. I just wanna talk
to Dr. Henske.

1319
01:19:28,720 --> 01:19:32,380
He would be perfect to do
Beth Kramer's face work...

1320
01:19:32,450 --> 01:19:36,820
after the unbelievable job he did
on Mrs. Morton's buttocks.

1321
01:19:36,890 --> 01:19:42,200
Oh, I'm gonna be right back.
Will you just...

1322
01:19:47,270 --> 01:19:50,070
<i>[Door Opens]</i>

1323
01:19:54,280 --> 01:19:56,220
[Whispering]
Ray?

1324
01:19:56,280 --> 01:19:59,950
Jesus! You scared me.
For God's sakes!

1325
01:20:00,020 --> 01:20:04,480
I came to warn you.
Mrs. Potter's gonna come up here...

1326
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:06,920
to get some pictures
that Mr. Potter wants you to see.

1327
01:20:06,990 --> 01:20:10,020
- She's lookin' for you.
- Now, I closed the safe!

1328
01:20:10,100 --> 01:20:13,460
This is a tough safe!
I'm outta practice. I can't...

1329
01:20:13,530 --> 01:20:17,770
- Did they see you come up here?
- I, I don't think so.

1330
01:20:17,840 --> 01:20:20,140
Get out there and stand watch.

1331
01:20:20,210 --> 01:20:23,340
I'm gonna do this again.

1332
01:20:23,410 --> 01:20:25,340
Are you okay?

1333
01:20:25,410 --> 01:20:27,680
I'm fine, I'm fine.
Get out! Get out!

1334
01:20:27,750 --> 01:20:32,280
If you could fit it into your schedule,
it would mean so much to Beth.

1335
01:20:32,350 --> 01:20:35,150
She's been so down
since the divorce.

1336
01:20:35,220 --> 01:20:39,750
And don't you think...
he got custody of the polo ponies.

1337
01:20:39,830 --> 01:20:42,450
Chi Chi, don't forget
those photographs for Mr. Winkler.

1338
01:20:42,530 --> 01:20:44,830
- Where'd he go?
- I'll get them.

1339
01:20:44,900 --> 01:20:47,590
- So, you will try?
- I'll do my best.

1340
01:20:47,670 --> 01:20:51,190
Kiss, kiss. Whoops!

1341
01:21:02,750 --> 01:21:05,120
Mrs. Potter is coming.

1342
01:21:25,040 --> 01:21:27,530
- She's gone.
- [Whispering] Shh, not so loud.

1343
01:21:27,610 --> 01:21:30,170
[Whispering]
But she's gone. She's gone.

1344
01:21:30,240 --> 01:21:33,180
Thank you, dear.
I want to show those to Mr. Winkler.

1345
01:21:33,250 --> 01:21:36,770
- He wouldn't leave without saying good-bye,
would he? - I don't know, he's not upstairs.

1346
01:21:36,850 --> 01:21:40,950
- Jesus.
- I met a wonderful man downstairs.

1347
01:21:41,020 --> 01:21:45,650
He seemed to like me. He said I
reminded him of his wife who's dead.

1348
01:21:45,730 --> 01:21:48,850
But I assume he meant
when she was alive.

1349
01:21:48,930 --> 01:21:53,030
May, can you stop talking to me
while I'm doing this?

1350
01:21:53,100 --> 01:21:57,370
Little short fellow.
Bright yellow shirt, unbelievable tie.

1351
01:21:57,440 --> 01:22:00,030
Oh, yes. I think I know
the gentleman you mean.

1352
01:22:00,110 --> 01:22:02,970
He was going
up the stairs before.

1353
01:22:03,040 --> 01:22:06,640
- Are you sure?
- Yes. Mr. Winkler.

1354
01:22:15,620 --> 01:22:18,090
Ray, I hear something.

1355
01:22:20,630 --> 01:22:22,060
Oh!

1356
01:22:22,130 --> 01:22:24,260
<i>She's not feeling well.
I took her up here.</i>

1357
01:22:24,330 --> 01:22:27,600
- Yes, she's had one of her spells.
- Spells?

1358
01:22:27,670 --> 01:22:30,400
- Yes, she gets spells.
- How extraordinary. We have a doctor right here.

1359
01:22:30,470 --> 01:22:34,030
- No, not necessary. She gets these spells.
- I'm a hemophiliac.

1360
01:22:34,110 --> 01:22:37,240
- Oh, dear God! Are you bleeding?
- Why would I be bleeding?

1361
01:22:37,310 --> 01:22:39,440
No, she... her neck.
Wasn't your neck...

1362
01:22:39,510 --> 01:22:42,380
It is, but my nasal passages
are clearing up now.

1363
01:22:42,450 --> 01:22:45,280
I handle all this. On weekends,
I do this for a little hobby.

1364
01:22:45,350 --> 01:22:48,840
- She had champagne.
- Poor darling. I'll go get Dr. Henske.

1365
01:22:48,920 --> 01:22:52,790
Really, I'm... Ray, you have
my cortisone pills.

1366
01:22:52,860 --> 01:22:54,790
- Me?
- My medication?

1367
01:22:54,860 --> 01:22:58,190
I will feel a whole lot better
if I let Dr. Henske take a look at her.

1368
01:22:58,270 --> 01:23:03,170
No, no, you just relax, put your
feet up, and I'll go get Dr. Henske.

1369
01:23:03,240 --> 01:23:07,200
A hemophiliac? Cortisone? Where
did you come up with these things?

1370
01:23:07,270 --> 01:23:11,040
- It's on TV.
- The weather's on TV. I said stay with the weather.

1371
01:23:11,110 --> 01:23:13,170
I thought I did some
really quick thinking.

1372
01:23:13,250 --> 01:23:15,770
Yes, very quick. Meanwhile,
you're gonna be examined now.

1373
01:23:15,850 --> 01:23:18,040
Why?
I just had a checkup.

1374
01:23:18,120 --> 01:23:23,180
Jesus! I got no time to work here.
They'll be back in seconds.

1375
01:23:29,660 --> 01:23:31,720
I can't tell the difference
between these.

1376
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:34,160
<i>God! Then you better
take 'em both.</i>

1377
01:23:34,230 --> 01:23:37,860
I can't take 'em both. If they come back
and don't find any necklace here,

1378
01:23:37,940 --> 01:23:40,370
we've been suspiciously seen
in the bedroom.

1379
01:23:40,440 --> 01:23:44,210
- I'll go right to jail.
- Especially with your D.N.A.

1380
01:23:44,280 --> 01:23:47,370
What does my D.N.A. Got
to do with it?

1381
01:23:47,450 --> 01:23:50,680
You better make a choice,
'cause they're gonna be back any minute.

1382
01:24:03,960 --> 01:24:06,560
<i>Ray, let's go!</i>

1383
01:24:12,740 --> 01:24:16,270
All I know
is what I told you, Doctor.

1384
01:24:16,340 --> 01:24:19,070
She's right in here.
Come along.

1385
01:24:19,150 --> 01:24:21,440
Here's Dr. Henske.

1386
01:24:21,510 --> 01:24:23,510
Now, what seems
to be the trouble?

1387
01:24:23,580 --> 01:24:25,980
False alarm.
It was a hot flash.

1388
01:24:26,050 --> 01:24:29,350
<i>I think it was a menopausal thing.
I've seen it before.</i>

1389
01:24:29,420 --> 01:24:32,550
- I'm given to occasional spells.
- Spells?

1390
01:24:32,630 --> 01:24:35,250
Well, not spells, but, you know,
she was drinkin' booze...

1391
01:24:35,330 --> 01:24:39,820
No, no, sometimes for no good reason
I get hot and cold flashes.

1392
01:24:39,900 --> 01:24:45,530
The room will begin to spin, then spots
before my eyes, a ringing in my ears.

1393
01:24:45,610 --> 01:24:48,730
You're making too much of it.
We should go.

1394
01:24:48,810 --> 01:24:52,740
Little pinpoints of light and my tongue
turns black, and I can't swallow.

1395
01:24:52,810 --> 01:24:55,870
- Really?
- They diagnosed it as Parkinson's.

1396
01:24:55,950 --> 01:24:59,250
But they think it could be
the Ebola virus or Mad Cow Disease.

1397
01:24:59,320 --> 01:25:02,650
We gotta get her out of here because,
you know, it's a false positive.

1398
01:25:02,720 --> 01:25:04,950
Come, sweetheart,
we're due, we're due.

1399
01:25:05,030 --> 01:25:06,990
<i>I do hope you feel better.</i>

1400
01:25:07,060 --> 01:25:11,190
And not to worry, Mr. Winkler, the
theater in Aspen will just have to wait.

1401
01:25:11,260 --> 01:25:14,200
The Ebola virus or Mad Cow.

1402
01:25:14,270 --> 01:25:18,070
- I just said the first thing that came into my mouth.
- Great.

1403
01:25:18,140 --> 01:25:20,070
- I tried to do my best...
- hello again!

1404
01:25:20,140 --> 01:25:24,340
George! Do I still remind you
of your wife?

1405
01:25:24,410 --> 01:25:26,350
You kill me.
You're great.

1406
01:25:26,410 --> 01:25:30,650
You're not feeling well. I'm taking
her home. She's not feeling well.

1407
01:25:30,720 --> 01:25:33,880
I'm in the book. May Sloan.
I'll, I'll be better.

1408
01:25:33,950 --> 01:25:36,350
Oh!
Well, I'll call you.

1409
01:25:43,960 --> 01:25:47,870
- Ray, I just got the news about Frenchy.
- Frenchy?

1410
01:25:47,930 --> 01:25:50,130
Didn't you hear?
Sunset's gone under.

1411
01:25:50,200 --> 01:25:52,970
She was defrauded out of every penny
she owns and then some.

1412
01:25:53,040 --> 01:25:56,170
And I know you're out of there,
but I figured you'd know.

1413
01:25:56,240 --> 01:25:59,700
Yeah, sure, I do know.
I, I, I...

1414
01:26:12,590 --> 01:26:15,720
<i>[Ray]
I came as soon as I heard.</i>

1415
01:26:17,130 --> 01:26:20,020
I got exactly what I deserved.

1416
01:26:20,150 --> 01:26:22,680
I really missed you, Frenchy.

1417
01:26:22,750 --> 01:26:25,880
<i>I'm sorry I blew
our cookie company,</i>

1418
01:26:25,960 --> 01:26:29,250
<i>but I'm even more sorry
I blew our marriage, Ray.</i>

1419
01:26:29,330 --> 01:26:32,820
What do you do? Everybody makes
mistakes, you know what I mean?

1420
01:26:32,900 --> 01:26:35,590
The important thing is
I still love you.

1421
01:26:35,670 --> 01:26:38,360
I don't deserve it.
I behaved badly.

1422
01:26:38,430 --> 01:26:42,270
You behaved like an ass, but that's one
of those "A" words you used to practice.

1423
01:26:42,340 --> 01:26:43,900
Ass.

1424
01:26:43,970 --> 01:26:48,540
But I'm not the easiest guy to
get along with. I'm not Mr. Sensitive.

1425
01:26:48,610 --> 01:26:52,740
There's a lot of things
I could've done differently, maybe.

1426
01:26:52,820 --> 01:26:57,120
We stayed in separate rooms
the whole trip, Ray. That's the truth.

1427
01:26:57,190 --> 01:27:00,050
So where's David now?

1428
01:27:00,120 --> 01:27:03,850
- He split the second I went bust.
- No! I don't believe it.

1429
01:27:03,930 --> 01:27:07,390
- He was hustling me for the dough. Sure.
- Oh, jeez.

1430
01:27:07,460 --> 01:27:10,190
So now we gotta all
begin again, you know.

1431
01:27:10,270 --> 01:27:13,200
And in more ways than one.

1432
01:27:13,270 --> 01:27:16,170
- You still want me?
- Still want you? I'm...

1433
01:27:16,240 --> 01:27:19,500
Frenchy, you gotta ask a question
like that? I'm crazy about you.

1434
01:27:19,580 --> 01:27:21,510
I'm crazy about you too.

1435
01:27:21,580 --> 01:27:23,670
You're a goddess to me.
I'm nuts for you.

1436
01:27:23,750 --> 01:27:25,810
You got...
Of course I want you.

1437
01:27:25,880 --> 01:27:28,080
But we're broke, you know.
We haven't got a dime.

1438
01:27:28,150 --> 01:27:31,310
We don't even own a stick
of this furniture we're sittin' on.

1439
01:27:31,390 --> 01:27:34,650
Can I show you something? Will you
sit here? May I show you one thing?

1440
01:27:34,720 --> 01:27:37,190
- Can I show you... Just let me show you something.
- Okay.

1441
01:27:39,630 --> 01:27:42,150
I think you're gonna be
very, very proud of me.

1442
01:27:42,230 --> 01:27:44,170
<i>What?</i>

1443
01:27:44,230 --> 01:27:49,300
<i>- That's Chi Chi Potter's.
- Was. Was Chi Chi... Was.</i>

1444
01:27:49,370 --> 01:27:53,100
Keyword. Was. I'm tellin' you,
I never felt so great.

1445
01:27:53,180 --> 01:27:56,080
I was back in action again.
I felt alive, you know.

1446
01:27:56,150 --> 01:27:58,710
'Cause I always felt that you were
keeping me with this whole cookie thing.

1447
01:27:58,780 --> 01:28:02,620
- Hey, this is glass.
- What are you talking about, glass? How's it glass?

1448
01:28:02,690 --> 01:28:06,250
- It's fake.
- What do you mean, fake? How the hell would you know?

1449
01:28:06,320 --> 01:28:09,050
I can tell fake from real.
This ain't even good fake.

1450
01:28:09,130 --> 01:28:11,920
What are you talking about?
What do you mean, it's fake?

1451
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:15,830
You know, it might fool some idiot
with no eye or no brains,

1452
01:28:15,900 --> 01:28:18,890
but it'd never pass
with a normal person.

1453
01:28:18,970 --> 01:28:21,700
What are you... You're telling me
that I got the phony one?

1454
01:28:21,770 --> 01:28:25,570
- I came away with the wrong thing?
- That sounds like your M.O.

1455
01:28:25,640 --> 01:28:28,700
- You're nuts! I was in the room.
- Yeah.

1456
01:28:28,780 --> 01:28:32,210
And I was gonna substitute
the glass one for the real one.

1457
01:28:32,280 --> 01:28:34,220
Then everything got confusing.

1458
01:28:34,280 --> 01:28:37,310
It's good to see you got
the same great instincts.

1459
01:28:37,390 --> 01:28:39,980
- You're so wrong.
- It really is.

1460
01:28:40,060 --> 01:28:43,550
- You take all those lessons, you think you got taste.
- Wait a minute.

1461
01:28:43,630 --> 01:28:45,590
I'm gonna show you something.

1462
01:28:45,660 --> 01:28:49,830
You think you learn class and taste,
but you know nothing about jewelry.

1463
01:28:49,900 --> 01:28:53,840
We take this and fence it.
We go to Florida. It's the goods.

1464
01:28:53,900 --> 01:28:57,860
That ain't gonna get us on the subway,
much less to Florida.

1465
01:28:57,940 --> 01:29:00,030
What? You know,
you're such a know-everything.

1466
01:29:00,110 --> 01:29:04,310
You don't have to be a rocket scientist
to spot a clinker like this.

1467
01:29:04,380 --> 01:29:07,280
Whoever made it for you,
you overpaid.

1468
01:29:07,350 --> 01:29:09,750
What can I do if you're wrong?
What can I do?

1469
01:29:09,820 --> 01:29:12,980
Can I take your nose and twist it
till you turn blue?

1470
01:29:13,060 --> 01:29:16,180
<i>Sure.</i>

1471
01:29:24,930 --> 01:29:29,030
<i>Gee, you broke it.</i>

1472
01:29:29,110 --> 01:29:31,840
It's glass, Ray.

1473
01:29:31,910 --> 01:29:35,740
I know, but it's...

1474
01:29:35,810 --> 01:29:38,250
Well, Frenchy,
I'm not cleaning it up.

1475
01:29:38,310 --> 01:29:41,310
You broke it.
You got glass over everything.

1476
01:29:41,380 --> 01:29:45,290
It's dangerous.
You... Jesus, I'm...

1477
01:29:45,360 --> 01:29:47,820
I don't know what you see in me.
I'm such a screwup.

1478
01:29:47,890 --> 01:29:50,880
It's glass! Don't you understand?
I got the glass one.

1479
01:29:50,960 --> 01:29:53,360
All that matters
is that we have each other.

1480
01:29:53,430 --> 01:29:58,560
We didn't there for a while and it
made me realize how much I need you.

1481
01:29:58,630 --> 01:30:01,540
- Yeah, but you're married to such a loser, Frenchy.
- No.

1482
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:04,160
<i>- It's glass!
- I'm the luckiest woman in the world.</i>

1483
01:30:04,240 --> 01:30:07,440
<i>And the brokest. I'm topped out.
We got nothing.</i>

1484
01:30:07,510 --> 01:30:10,140
<i>As usual, I come up empty.</i>

1485
01:30:10,210 --> 01:30:12,310
We could pawn this.

1486
01:30:12,380 --> 01:30:14,320
<i>What is this?</i>

1487
01:30:14,380 --> 01:30:18,050
What is this thing?
Who? Who-Who?

1488
01:30:18,120 --> 01:30:20,110
I don't understand.
Who's the Duke of Windsor?

1489
01:30:20,190 --> 01:30:22,380
<i>Actually, we could probably
auction it.</i>

1490
01:30:22,460 --> 01:30:25,150
<i>- Where'd you get this? It looks...
- From David.</i>

1491
01:30:25,230 --> 01:30:28,790
- David gave you this?
- Well, he doesn't know it yet.

1492
01:30:28,870 --> 01:30:30,990
I don't get it.
What do you mean?

1493
01:30:31,070 --> 01:30:35,400
Hey, it was you who taught me
how to open a safe.

1494
01:30:35,470 --> 01:30:40,880
L... That was one of my fondest
memories of our time together.

1495
01:30:40,940 --> 01:30:43,940
What are you saying?
You boosted this from David's safe?

1496
01:30:44,010 --> 01:30:46,480
That...
Frenchy, that's stealing.

1497
01:30:46,550 --> 01:30:50,080
Not exactly.
Look, it's a long story, Ray.

1498
01:30:50,150 --> 01:30:54,090
Let's sell it, and I'll fill you in
on the flight to Miami.

1499
01:31:00,160 --> 01:31:04,900
- Sweetheart, you are the greatest.
- Yeah.

1500
