1
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:33,807
I pledge allegiance to the flag
of the United States ofAmerica.

2
00:00:33,969 --> 00:00:36,563
And to the republic,
for which it stands.

3
00:00:36,729 --> 00:00:40,244
One nation under God,
indivisible, with liberty -

4
00:00:40,409 --> 00:00:42,127
and justice forall.

5
00:03:47,009 --> 00:03:48,488
Take your wig off.

6
00:03:49,529 --> 00:03:51,201
Take your wig off.

7
00:03:57,049 --> 00:03:59,119
Turn and face the wall.

8
00:04:00,009 --> 00:04:02,045
Turn and face the wall.

9
00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:04,120
Face the wall.

10
00:04:05,969 --> 00:04:07,846
All right, that's it.

11
00:04:13,689 --> 00:04:18,524
- Are you a natural blonde?
- Chicken Delight! He delivers!

12
00:04:18,689 --> 00:04:21,601
Don't put that in here.
She ain't my type.

13
00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:26,479
That's my wife you're talking about.
She's here for our conjugal visit.

14
00:04:26,649 --> 00:04:30,119
Come, let daddy show you
what he's got in his pants for you.

15
00:04:30,289 --> 00:04:34,885
She's got the same thing under her skirt
that you've got in your pants.

16
00:04:35,049 --> 00:04:37,483
Come on, you guys,
we've got a lady here.

17
00:04:37,649 --> 00:04:41,005
Have you got any concealed weapons
they didn't find up front?

18
00:04:41,169 --> 00:04:45,287
- You've got something concealed...
- But it ain't no weapon.

19
00:04:45,449 --> 00:04:48,043
Let's see you strip
just to make sure.

20
00:05:05,569 --> 00:05:07,799
A star is born!

21
00:05:11,009 --> 00:05:12,840
Kirkland, watch your hands.

22
00:05:18,569 --> 00:05:20,719
Come on, Kirkland. Let's go.

23
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:29,048
Can you make a phone call for me?

24
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:45,000
Where the hell is he?

25
00:05:46,569 --> 00:05:49,163
What do you mean, he's in jail?

26
00:05:49,529 --> 00:05:51,565
My lawyer's in jail?

27
00:05:52,609 --> 00:05:54,327
Contempt of court?

28
00:05:54,609 --> 00:05:58,568
He's too goddamn emotional.
Get him. I've had a car accident.

29
00:05:58,729 --> 00:06:02,244
I haven't left the scene
of the accident, I'm in it!

30
00:06:04,569 --> 00:06:07,447
Can't you hear the confusion?
Do you hear this noise?

31
00:06:07,609 --> 00:06:11,158
They're trying to get me out ofthe car.
I'm trapped because some prick...

32
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:13,206
Could you move back,
so we can get you out?

33
00:06:13,369 --> 00:06:16,884
Can't you see I'm on the phone?
Keep it down!

34
00:06:17,049 --> 00:06:18,960
I'm trying... Goddammit!

35
00:06:19,169 --> 00:06:23,481
Tell Arthur to get over here.
I'm on Eager Street. Where are we?

36
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:27,562
Eager Street... Just tell him to
get over here. You can't miss it.

37
00:06:28,609 --> 00:06:32,727
I understand you took a swing
at Judge Fleming. Is that true?

38
00:06:33,049 --> 00:06:37,964
Kiley, why not do something about
that kid? Put him someplace else.

39
00:06:38,329 --> 00:06:41,127
They're just having some fun
with him, that's all.

40
00:06:41,289 --> 00:06:44,167
- Fun?
- Sometimes the boys get bored.

41
00:06:45,529 --> 00:06:48,282
For you,
it's still new and exciting.

42
00:06:48,729 --> 00:06:50,048
Sign here.

43
00:06:52,569 --> 00:06:55,129
Why don't you ease up on the judge?

44
00:06:56,849 --> 00:06:58,601
He's your kind of guy, huh?

45
00:06:59,609 --> 00:07:04,046
Yeah, Fleming's a tough man.
Hates scum almost as much as we do.

46
00:07:07,769 --> 00:07:09,805
Good morning, Mr Kirkland.

47
00:07:31,809 --> 00:07:33,037
Carl!

48
00:07:36,369 --> 00:07:38,439
Come on. Here. Are you all right?

49
00:07:38,609 --> 00:07:44,445
Sue the son of a bitch who did this
for every cent he's got. Every nickel.

50
00:07:44,689 --> 00:07:47,362
- Carl, are you all right?
- Disappear.

51
00:07:47,929 --> 00:07:50,841
- Miss, why don't you...
- She's not hurt. Nothing to report.

52
00:07:51,009 --> 00:07:54,479
- Wait in the car.
- There's no need for the wife to know.

53
00:07:54,649 --> 00:07:59,484
After all I was your first client,
Arthur. You broke cherry on me.

54
00:07:59,649 --> 00:08:04,439
Not the time to go down memory lane.
Let's just get you to the hospital.

55
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:07,965
You're the best, Arthur.
Get every nickel and put him away.

56
00:08:08,129 --> 00:08:12,088
- I'll see he gets the death penalty.
- Death is okay too.

57
00:08:12,529 --> 00:08:16,078
- You stink. Did somebody piss on you?
- Get him out of here.

58
00:08:16,249 --> 00:08:20,959
Let nobody use my car phone. I'm in
the hospital and some jerk calls Rome.

59
00:08:21,129 --> 00:08:23,279
You son of a bitch! You lunatic!

60
00:08:23,489 --> 00:08:25,878
Carl, you're gonna have a stroke.

61
00:08:26,049 --> 00:08:28,438
You'll have to deal with my lawyer.

62
00:08:28,609 --> 00:08:33,239
- You'll die for this! He's the best!
- It's not even my car.

63
00:08:33,569 --> 00:08:36,208
Be calm, Carl. Be calm.

64
00:08:37,489 --> 00:08:42,119
- I have a terrible headache.
- You'll be all right. I'll call you.

65
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:46,245
- What about this guy here?
- He says he's all right.

66
00:08:48,689 --> 00:08:52,045
It's a friend's car.
I just borrowed it for the night.

67
00:08:52,249 --> 00:08:55,321
- How am I gonna tell him?
- You should go to the hospital.

68
00:08:55,489 --> 00:08:59,118
- I'm okay, but the car...
- Let me take you to the hospital.

69
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:03,521
My horoscope said it would be a great
day and look what happened. Shit!

70
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:29,447
It's not going to
be that way this time.

71
00:09:30,009 --> 00:09:34,241
We should request a postponement.
That would put us into January.

72
00:09:34,409 --> 00:09:36,161
Look at me when I'm talking to you!

73
00:09:36,329 --> 00:09:40,925
- The DA is willing to go two years.
- That's a lot of fucking time, man.

74
00:09:42,889 --> 00:09:45,847
- I ain't kissing nobody's ass.
- I'm not asking you to.

75
00:09:46,009 --> 00:09:48,364
Just give it a little pat.

76
00:09:48,929 --> 00:09:51,204
Arthur. Arthur.

77
00:09:51,729 --> 00:09:54,368
Excuse me. Hold it, Wenke.

78
00:09:54,889 --> 00:09:56,845
- Where are you going?
- The bathroom.

79
00:09:57,009 --> 00:09:59,762
Go home and change.
You look like shit.

80
00:09:59,929 --> 00:10:03,239
What would you say if I walked
into court looking like that?

81
00:10:03,409 --> 00:10:04,842
What would you say?

82
00:10:07,009 --> 00:10:09,318
I don't wanna
keep harping on this, -

83
00:10:09,489 --> 00:10:14,517
- but the Ethics Committee is checking
up on everyone. You've gotta watch it.

84
00:10:14,689 --> 00:10:17,157
Last week two lawyers were
disbarred on minor charges.

85
00:10:17,329 --> 00:10:19,718
You get thrown in jail
on contempt of court.

86
00:10:19,889 --> 00:10:21,402
Fleming got me crazy.

87
00:10:21,569 --> 00:10:25,926
Push him on that McCullaugh thing
and there will be big trouble.

88
00:10:26,089 --> 00:10:30,958
McCullaugh's innocent
and Fleming won't look at the evidence.

89
00:10:31,129 --> 00:10:35,361
- What do you want me to do?
- You don't threaten a judge!

90
00:10:43,569 --> 00:10:46,959
Will you do me a personal favour?
Put this on.

91
00:10:52,889 --> 00:10:55,608
I got Fleming
first thing this morning.

92
00:10:55,769 --> 00:10:57,600
Give him my love.

93
00:10:58,929 --> 00:11:01,238
The tie, I like it.

94
00:11:01,649 --> 00:11:04,209
It's Fleming's favourite colour.

95
00:11:08,849 --> 00:11:13,001
All rise. Criminal Court of
Baltimore City is now in session.

96
00:11:13,169 --> 00:11:16,286
The Honourable
Henry T. Fleming presiding.

97
00:11:17,089 --> 00:11:18,647
Be seated.

98
00:11:18,809 --> 00:11:20,959
If Your Honour please,
for the first matter -

99
00:11:21,129 --> 00:11:27,079
- the State would call case number
57746898, State versus Robert Wenke.

100
00:11:27,249 --> 00:11:30,685
Mr Wenke, may I ask you
to step forward, please.

101
00:11:35,929 --> 00:11:39,046
How many times have you been
before the bench, Mr Wenke?

102
00:11:39,209 --> 00:11:41,439
Three times, Your Honour.

103
00:11:42,689 --> 00:11:46,602
Once for assault, once for arson,
once for grand larceny.

104
00:11:46,769 --> 00:11:49,488
And now indecent exposure.

105
00:11:50,089 --> 00:11:54,367
What's the matter? Can't you decide
what you wanna be when you grow up?

106
00:11:54,849 --> 00:11:56,965
Anything to say?

107
00:12:00,609 --> 00:12:03,840
Yes, Your Honour.
I'm a loyal Colts fan.

108
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:15,204
You are also a revolting,
despicable scum of the earth -

109
00:12:15,369 --> 00:12:17,883
- who should be
squashed like a cockroach.

110
00:12:18,049 --> 00:12:20,688
I object. My client has not
been found guilty yet.

111
00:12:20,849 --> 00:12:23,204
You're absolutely right, Counsellor.

112
00:12:23,369 --> 00:12:27,647
It's now 9:40.
At 9:41 he will be guilty.

113
00:12:32,369 --> 00:12:36,442
I find the defendant guilty.
Sentence to be imposed later.

114
00:12:38,369 --> 00:12:41,247
I would like Mr Wenke's bail
to be continued.

115
00:12:41,409 --> 00:12:43,400
- Bail is revoked.
- Thank you.

116
00:12:43,569 --> 00:12:48,518
The State will now call
number 57746899.

117
00:12:48,689 --> 00:12:50,725
That was very good work.

118
00:12:51,529 --> 00:12:54,839
Very nice. Colts fan.
I need Colts? Terrific, Wenke.

119
00:12:55,529 --> 00:12:57,167
Then you do know?

120
00:12:57,329 --> 00:12:59,160
The big white house?

121
00:12:59,329 --> 00:13:02,765
With the fat columns out in front
on Greenway Avenue?

122
00:13:04,049 --> 00:13:06,802
Guess how much that house is worth.

123
00:13:06,969 --> 00:13:09,642
- I don't know.
- Take a guess.

124
00:13:10,449 --> 00:13:12,440
Seven million.

125
00:13:12,609 --> 00:13:17,205
243,000 dollars.
Now that's some nut I've got, huh?

126
00:13:18,889 --> 00:13:23,963
I just need some more accident cases.
I ought to throw banana peels around.

127
00:13:24,129 --> 00:13:28,281
Recess is almost over,
and I only have this lottery case...

128
00:13:28,449 --> 00:13:31,998
Did you knowthere's a guy
eating something off your table?

129
00:13:32,169 --> 00:13:36,003
The guy you're prosecuting.
He's eating the lottery tickets.

130
00:13:38,449 --> 00:13:41,486
Holy shit!
Gibson, get the hell away!

131
00:13:44,049 --> 00:13:47,962
- Don't swallow, you son of a bitch!
- That's my client!

132
00:13:48,449 --> 00:13:50,246
Don't swallow!

133
00:14:06,449 --> 00:14:10,522
Gentlemen, need I remind you
you are in a court of law?

134
00:14:20,769 --> 00:14:23,727
Now let's proceed
in an orderly fashion.

135
00:14:31,569 --> 00:14:33,799
What the hell are you doing?

136
00:14:41,689 --> 00:14:44,567
Does the defence have
anything to add?

137
00:14:45,569 --> 00:14:47,480
Your Honour...

138
00:14:48,609 --> 00:14:51,442
I guess I should request a recess -

139
00:14:51,609 --> 00:14:55,841
- so my client could get something
to eat. He's obviously very hungry.

140
00:15:01,129 --> 00:15:04,485
My client, McCullaugh.
Could I see him for a minute?

141
00:15:04,649 --> 00:15:06,446
Sure, Mr Kirkland.

142
00:15:06,889 --> 00:15:08,527
Stick your hand out.

143
00:15:09,689 --> 00:15:11,361
Mr Kirkland, what happened?

144
00:15:11,529 --> 00:15:15,363
I just want to reaffirm what I said
yesterday. We'll get you out.

145
00:15:15,529 --> 00:15:18,999
I knowyou're trying,
but this is crazy, you know?.

146
00:15:19,169 --> 00:15:20,204
I know it.

147
00:15:20,369 --> 00:15:24,157
You said you had evidence
that proves I'm innocent.

148
00:15:24,329 --> 00:15:27,639
- Yes, you're innocent.
- And Judge Fleming agrees, right?

149
00:15:27,809 --> 00:15:31,119
If everyone agrees I'm innocent,
why am I going back to jail?

150
00:15:31,289 --> 00:15:34,964
There's enough proof,
but the court won't accept it.

151
00:15:35,129 --> 00:15:37,927
- Why not?
- Well, there's a law...

152
00:15:38,169 --> 00:15:43,687
It says that evidence must be submitted
within a certain time period.

153
00:15:43,929 --> 00:15:46,363
And ours came in three days late.

154
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:50,966
What difference does that make?
Even if it came in three years late.

155
00:15:51,129 --> 00:15:54,883
They've got the proofthey need.
They should let me go.

156
00:15:55,129 --> 00:15:59,202
The judge sends me to jail and he knows
I'm innocent. What's going on?

157
00:15:59,369 --> 00:16:02,600
It's gonna take more time.
Any otherjudge would let you out.

158
00:16:02,769 --> 00:16:06,318
But Fleming goes
by the letter ofthe law.

159
00:16:06,489 --> 00:16:10,084
Jeff, I promise I'll get you out.
I promise.

160
00:16:10,249 --> 00:16:13,047
He promises to get you out.
Don't worry.

161
00:16:24,249 --> 00:16:26,001
Judge Fleming.

162
00:16:27,489 --> 00:16:31,687
I want to apologise for my behaviour
in the courtroom the other day.

163
00:16:31,849 --> 00:16:35,444
I don't want to hear it.
I don't want to hear anything.

164
00:16:35,649 --> 00:16:37,958
That's understandable, sir.

165
00:16:38,129 --> 00:16:41,326
But I thought maybe we could
discuss this McCullaugh case.

166
00:16:41,489 --> 00:16:44,049
You and l, man to man.
Off the record.

167
00:16:44,249 --> 00:16:47,764
Ifyou try to make a deal with me,
you might wind up back in jail.

168
00:16:48,089 --> 00:16:51,365
A deal? No, sir.
I'm not trying to make a deal.

169
00:16:51,529 --> 00:16:54,441
I understand your strict
enforcement of the statute.

170
00:16:54,609 --> 00:16:59,000
But my client's constitutional rights
are being denied.

171
00:16:59,169 --> 00:17:03,367
- My client is innocent.
- I don't give a shit about your client.

172
00:17:22,169 --> 00:17:23,488
Hi, Sherry.

173
00:17:24,169 --> 00:17:27,047
- Hi, Mr Kirkland.
- Mrs Tate, how are you?

174
00:17:27,209 --> 00:17:28,608
He'll be right with you.

175
00:17:29,289 --> 00:17:32,087
- Boy, do you look tired.
- Coffee, please.

176
00:17:32,249 --> 00:17:37,369
Mrs Tate wants to talk. Her son broke
his leg again. Neighbour's driveway.

177
00:17:37,529 --> 00:17:42,125
And Bricker wants to know ifyour client
will settle for 60,000 dollars.

178
00:17:42,289 --> 00:17:43,961
Coffee, please.

179
00:17:44,129 --> 00:17:48,407
You have three new clients today.
One's a whiplash, one's divorce.

180
00:17:48,569 --> 00:17:52,687
And the third has to do with amnesia.
I don't know what it is.

181
00:17:53,049 --> 00:17:54,926
What are you doing?

182
00:17:56,049 --> 00:17:59,359
- No foam.
- That's because it's deodorant.

183
00:17:59,529 --> 00:18:02,248
Don't forget to visit
your grandfather today.

184
00:18:02,409 --> 00:18:05,924
- And be in court at two fifteen.
- Coffee, please.

185
00:18:06,849 --> 00:18:08,760
Do you want some coffee?

186
00:18:09,889 --> 00:18:13,677
Sherry, stay with me today, dear.
I need you today.

187
00:18:19,889 --> 00:18:21,288
Arthur.

188
00:18:21,729 --> 00:18:24,004
Arthur, come here.

189
00:18:25,969 --> 00:18:27,527
Hi, Judge.

190
00:18:27,809 --> 00:18:30,323
Are we gonna get together
this weekend?

191
00:18:30,489 --> 00:18:34,846
I don't know. You're the only one
I've been dating these days.

192
00:18:35,009 --> 00:18:37,682
You promised
you'd go flying with me.

193
00:18:37,849 --> 00:18:39,328
I gotta tell you...

194
00:18:39,489 --> 00:18:43,926
I'm not too fond of anything
that takes place off the ground.

195
00:18:44,089 --> 00:18:47,525
I don't know.
I've got a thing about heights.

196
00:18:47,689 --> 00:18:51,443
- This is flying. It's different.
- How high up do you go?

197
00:18:51,809 --> 00:18:55,768
How high do you wanna go?
Come on, it'll be good for you.

198
00:18:56,489 --> 00:19:00,607
- Besides, it gets lonesome up there.
- Why don't you take your wife?

199
00:19:00,769 --> 00:19:03,442
The last thing we did together
was get married.

200
00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:06,362
Come on, Arthur. You promised me.

201
00:19:06,529 --> 00:19:10,317
- All right. What time?
- Sunday morning. Ten o'clock.

202
00:19:10,529 --> 00:19:13,362
Do you always carry
that thing with you?

203
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:17,244
There's law and there's order.
And that's order.

204
00:19:18,249 --> 00:19:20,046
Do you like egg rolls?

205
00:19:20,209 --> 00:19:22,200
- Yeah.
- Good.

206
00:19:22,729 --> 00:19:27,041
Come on, let's get out of here.
Easy, easy, easy. You got it.

207
00:19:27,769 --> 00:19:29,088
You son of a gun.

208
00:19:57,609 --> 00:20:00,123
So, it's another week already?

209
00:20:00,729 --> 00:20:03,562
Another week.
I don't know where time goes.

210
00:20:03,729 --> 00:20:06,880
No problems, Grandpa?
Everything all right?

211
00:20:07,489 --> 00:20:12,882
See this one? Wonderful woman. I went
to her husband's funeral. Fine man.

212
00:20:14,209 --> 00:20:15,847
Gitel?

213
00:20:17,689 --> 00:20:19,839
Hello, Sam.

214
00:20:20,129 --> 00:20:21,767
How are you?

215
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:24,443
This is my grandson, Arthur.

216
00:20:24,609 --> 00:20:26,645
- I'm pleased to meet you.
- Good to meet you.

217
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:29,721
- He goes to law school.
- I'm a lawyer.

218
00:20:30,209 --> 00:20:33,087
Take my advice.
Don't be in a hurry.

219
00:20:35,289 --> 00:20:37,519
He's a nice-looking boy.

220
00:20:37,689 --> 00:20:40,681
- My grandson.
- Yes...

221
00:20:46,529 --> 00:20:49,965
- Good to meet you.
- Pleased to have met you too.

222
00:20:53,209 --> 00:20:55,484
So, it's been a week.

223
00:20:55,649 --> 00:21:00,769
Yeah, it's been a week. Last week we
went for a ride in the car. Remember?

224
00:21:02,209 --> 00:21:04,404
That's a good machine.

225
00:21:05,449 --> 00:21:08,282
Always give signals when you turn.

226
00:21:09,049 --> 00:21:11,244
Right. Left.

227
00:21:20,569 --> 00:21:22,048
So...

228
00:21:26,449 --> 00:21:30,806
Are you a good lawyer?
Are you honest?

229
00:21:31,969 --> 00:21:34,324
Well, I don't know.

230
00:21:34,489 --> 00:21:38,880
Being honest doesn't have much to do
with being a lawyer, Grandpa.

231
00:21:39,049 --> 00:21:42,246
Ifyou're not honest,
you've got nothing.

232
00:21:44,289 --> 00:21:47,087
Your parents should see you now.

233
00:21:48,529 --> 00:21:50,963
To hell with them.

234
00:21:51,329 --> 00:21:55,083
They never cared before.
Why should they care now?

235
00:21:55,529 --> 00:21:58,282
- They're still your parents.
- No.

236
00:21:59,809 --> 00:22:04,200
You raised me. You're the one
who put me through law school.

237
00:22:04,369 --> 00:22:08,487
You're a wonderful man, Grandpa.
But your son, he's a shit.

238
00:22:11,769 --> 00:22:14,602
He was born with colic.

239
00:22:16,129 --> 00:22:18,324
Sam, I love you.

240
00:22:22,769 --> 00:22:26,444
Look at you.
Filled out, like a man.

241
00:22:27,569 --> 00:22:32,199
Soon you'll look like a lawyer
and you'll be a lawyer.

242
00:22:33,409 --> 00:22:38,244
I am a lawyer, Sam.
I've been a lawyer for twelve years.

243
00:22:50,329 --> 00:22:53,241
So, it's another week already.

244
00:22:58,649 --> 00:23:01,004
- Do you know Jules Stouffer?
- Yes, I do.

245
00:23:01,169 --> 00:23:03,603
- He was a client ofyours, right?
- Yes.

246
00:23:03,929 --> 00:23:07,285
Wasn't he originally
represented by Alvin Burton?

247
00:23:07,449 --> 00:23:10,566
- Yes, that is correct.
- Why did he change representation?

248
00:23:10,729 --> 00:23:15,519
I handled him on an assault charge.
That's my area, not Burton's.

249
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:19,762
Did Stouffer express
dissatisfaction with Mr Burton?

250
00:23:19,929 --> 00:23:23,968
Not at all. Burton's an excellent
lawyer. Are you going after him?

251
00:23:24,289 --> 00:23:28,123
- We're not going after anyone.
- Do you know David Crebbs?

252
00:23:28,289 --> 00:23:31,918
We're reviewing certain accusations
to determine if they're true -

253
00:23:32,089 --> 00:23:34,398
and to clean our own house.

254
00:23:34,689 --> 00:23:39,604
So please do not overdramatize this.
It's not the McCarthy hearings.

255
00:23:39,769 --> 00:23:42,283
Oh, that's a relief.

256
00:23:42,569 --> 00:23:47,199
So you're not gonna ask me: "Are you
now or have you ever been a lawyer?"

257
00:23:49,209 --> 00:23:52,679
- That wasn't amusing, Mr Kirkland.
- Do you know David Crebbs?

258
00:23:52,849 --> 00:23:55,317
No, it wasn't, Miss...?

259
00:23:57,329 --> 00:24:03,199
Packer. This isn't amusing. It is
ridiculous. Yes, I know David Crebbs.

260
00:24:03,369 --> 00:24:05,929
Have you ever seen...
Is this mike working?

261
00:24:08,089 --> 00:24:11,718
- Do you know David Crebbs?
- Why are we using microphones?

262
00:24:11,889 --> 00:24:16,724
- Why don't we just talk to each other?
- This is a hearing, Mr Kirkland.

263
00:24:17,129 --> 00:24:19,802
Yes. It's a hearing.

264
00:24:20,089 --> 00:24:23,604
- Do you know Jules Stouffer?
- We've already asked that.

265
00:24:23,769 --> 00:24:27,125
Are we through with Stouffer?
How about Alvin Burton?

266
00:24:27,289 --> 00:24:29,598
- Do you know David Crebbs?
- I've already asked that.

267
00:24:29,769 --> 00:24:32,363
- What did he say?
- He said yes.

268
00:24:32,529 --> 00:24:35,089
Have you ever seen him
intoxicated in court?

269
00:24:35,409 --> 00:24:41,439
David Crebbs has a speech impediment.
Check your records. It's in there.

270
00:24:42,129 --> 00:24:46,884
As answer to your question:
No, he doesn't drink. Not at all.

271
00:24:47,089 --> 00:24:50,240
At this point
I would just like to say -

272
00:24:50,409 --> 00:24:55,324
- that what this committee is doing
in theory is highly commendable.

273
00:24:55,569 --> 00:24:59,357
However, in practice it sucks.

274
00:25:00,169 --> 00:25:03,923
And I am not going to answer
any more questions.

275
00:25:11,809 --> 00:25:14,846
What do you think
we're trying to do in there?

276
00:25:15,689 --> 00:25:17,520
- Want a drink?
- No.

277
00:25:17,689 --> 00:25:22,683
Whatever you may think, we're not
conducting some kind of witch-hunt.

278
00:25:22,849 --> 00:25:24,601
What are you doing then?

279
00:25:24,809 --> 00:25:26,606
You might not be aware ofthis, -

280
00:25:26,769 --> 00:25:30,728
- but there's a lot of corruption
that nobody's doing anything about.

281
00:25:30,889 --> 00:25:34,086
- Do you think you're doing something?
- Yes, I do.

282
00:25:34,249 --> 00:25:37,798
That committee is
a very dangerous farce.

283
00:25:38,689 --> 00:25:41,601
Whoa, Mr Kirkland.

284
00:25:42,289 --> 00:25:44,883
I spend fourteen hours a day
on that committee.

285
00:25:45,049 --> 00:25:47,722
I don't do it to get
a few good laughs.

286
00:25:47,889 --> 00:25:51,404
You could spend the rest ofyour life.
You'll wind up a cop.

287
00:25:51,569 --> 00:25:56,324
Maybe ruining the careers of a few guys
who wiped their ass the wrong way.

288
00:25:56,489 --> 00:25:58,445
Other than that, nothing.

289
00:26:04,009 --> 00:26:05,727
So what do you think?

290
00:26:06,129 --> 00:26:07,687
About what?

291
00:26:08,049 --> 00:26:12,281
About me. What do you think?
Think I'm kind of interesting?

292
00:26:12,769 --> 00:26:15,237
Somebody you'd like
to have a drink with?

293
00:26:15,409 --> 00:26:17,684
I think that you're crazy.

294
00:26:18,769 --> 00:26:22,762
What about Daniel's?
Say, around seven thirty?

295
00:26:25,769 --> 00:26:27,487
I don't think so.

296
00:26:27,969 --> 00:26:29,482
Eight?

297
00:26:32,489 --> 00:26:34,400
Eight thirty.

298
00:26:43,529 --> 00:26:45,087
All right.

299
00:26:55,569 --> 00:26:58,242
I'm Arthur Kirkland.
You wanted to see me?

300
00:26:59,649 --> 00:27:01,128
Yeah.

301
00:27:06,249 --> 00:27:11,039
My man, Bambi,
he recommended you real highly.

302
00:27:11,209 --> 00:27:14,884
He said, Arthur Kirkland
was the man to see.

303
00:27:15,049 --> 00:27:17,483
Okay, Ralph,
tell me what happened.

304
00:27:17,649 --> 00:27:20,641
It says here
you were involved in a robbery.

305
00:27:20,809 --> 00:27:22,765
No, sir.

306
00:27:22,929 --> 00:27:26,842
What happened is, it was time
to come down on a nigger.

307
00:27:27,209 --> 00:27:31,964
It's like smoking. They've got to
have a nigger every twenty minutes.

308
00:27:32,169 --> 00:27:34,205
What happened is...

309
00:27:34,449 --> 00:27:37,600
I was in an alley, petting my dog,
when they came down on me.

310
00:27:37,769 --> 00:27:40,966
It states here
the dog was attacking you -

311
00:27:41,129 --> 00:27:43,927
when you were seen in the alley.

312
00:27:44,089 --> 00:27:46,887
Well, my dog, he gets like that.

313
00:27:47,049 --> 00:27:51,201
It also states that the dog
belonged to a Mrs B. Jackson.

314
00:27:52,889 --> 00:27:57,599
He sure looked like my dog.
He had that little...

315
00:27:57,769 --> 00:28:03,241
It also states that when asked
what you were doing you replied:

316
00:28:03,609 --> 00:28:06,646
"I don't know nothing
about that taxi cab."

317
00:28:06,809 --> 00:28:09,084
That's true. I don't.

318
00:28:09,249 --> 00:28:13,561
- How did you knowthere was one?
- Mr Kirkland, there's always one.

319
00:28:13,729 --> 00:28:19,440
Ralph, tell me the truth or get another
lawyer. I don't need the bullshit.

320
00:28:20,969 --> 00:28:22,527
Okay.

321
00:28:23,249 --> 00:28:25,524
I was in that cab,
but I didn't rob it.

322
00:28:25,689 --> 00:28:30,285
It was my cousin's idea.
I didn't know nothing. He's crazy.

323
00:28:33,129 --> 00:28:37,247
- What's your cousin's name?
- I don't know. I mean...

324
00:28:37,409 --> 00:28:41,118
- He lives over on Hillsdale.
- You don't know your cousin's name?

325
00:28:41,289 --> 00:28:46,124
Who do you think you're talking to?
Do you think I'm an idiot?

326
00:28:46,289 --> 00:28:50,362
I read a report, I can tell
if somebody's bullshitting me.

327
00:28:50,529 --> 00:28:53,646
Give me straight answers
or get another lawyer.

328
00:28:53,809 --> 00:28:57,279
I don't have time to listen to
some jive-ass put-me-on.

329
00:28:58,609 --> 00:29:00,122
Okay.

330
00:29:01,689 --> 00:29:06,444
It wasn't my idea,
but I did knowwhat was coming down.

331
00:29:07,489 --> 00:29:12,358
See me and my cousin Royce...
Royce Shavers.

332
00:29:15,009 --> 00:29:19,366
He figures that
since I am the way I am...

333
00:29:21,689 --> 00:29:26,399
Mr Kirkland,
I can look really fine sometimes.

334
00:29:28,169 --> 00:29:29,727
I'm sure you can.

335
00:29:31,969 --> 00:29:36,838
Royce figures we can be a couple.
You know, a man and a woman couple.

336
00:29:37,009 --> 00:29:42,083
A cab driver will pick up a couple
faster than he will two nigger men.

337
00:29:46,809 --> 00:29:50,438
We got into a cab
on Garrison Boulevard.

338
00:29:52,009 --> 00:29:57,242
And we asked him to take us down to
the harbour like we were tourists.

339
00:30:03,849 --> 00:30:07,159
I can't go to jail, man.

340
00:30:07,329 --> 00:30:10,526
I just can't do it.
I can't go to that place.

341
00:30:11,689 --> 00:30:15,364
Please, Mr Kirkland,
you've got to help me.

342
00:30:18,489 --> 00:30:20,320
Please...

343
00:30:21,689 --> 00:30:25,443
Okay, I'll help you, Ralph.
Just don't lie to me.

344
00:30:26,409 --> 00:30:28,604
- Okay?
- Yes, sir.

345
00:30:31,969 --> 00:30:35,359
- Don't lie to me, okay?
- Yes, sir.

346
00:30:35,729 --> 00:30:37,401
Thank you.

347
00:30:45,289 --> 00:30:48,201
Thanks for bringing me home, Gail.

348
00:30:50,449 --> 00:30:52,167
Oh, God.

349
00:30:52,729 --> 00:30:57,439
You really take renting an unfurnished
apartment literally, don't you?

350
00:30:57,689 --> 00:31:00,283
It doesn't have to stay this way.

351
00:31:02,729 --> 00:31:06,961
What happened? Did your wife
take you in the divorce settlement?

352
00:31:07,369 --> 00:31:09,360
She had a better lawyer.

353
00:31:11,529 --> 00:31:13,804
Do you get to see your kids much?

354
00:31:14,249 --> 00:31:17,685
They're in California.
Phone calls, holidays.

355
00:31:19,129 --> 00:31:21,882
Put the food out.
I'll get the plates.

356
00:31:22,049 --> 00:31:25,086
I guess I was lucky.
We never had any kids.

357
00:31:25,889 --> 00:31:28,961
- How long were you married?
- Three years.

358
00:31:29,249 --> 00:31:31,888
- Were you in love?
- No...

359
00:31:33,049 --> 00:31:35,279
I was in love with the law.

360
00:31:36,049 --> 00:31:38,165
You knowwhat I mean?

361
00:31:39,809 --> 00:31:41,925
You got a serving spoon?

362
00:31:42,849 --> 00:31:44,521
Serving spoon.

363
00:31:45,689 --> 00:31:47,327
Thank you.

364
00:31:49,009 --> 00:31:51,477
So, do you eat out a lot?

365
00:31:51,849 --> 00:31:54,238
- Yeah. Do you?
- Yeah.

366
00:31:55,009 --> 00:31:58,240
The committee works
just about every night.

367
00:31:59,649 --> 00:32:02,561
How did you feel when you
walked out on the committee?

368
00:32:02,729 --> 00:32:07,439
- Did you feel daggers in your back?
- That's a very dangerous group.

369
00:32:08,049 --> 00:32:10,563
Jesus, here we go...

370
00:32:10,969 --> 00:32:15,645
Arthur, why do you feel
it's dangerous?

371
00:32:16,169 --> 00:32:20,447
You con the public to think
you're doing something, and you're not.

372
00:32:20,609 --> 00:32:25,603
We are doing something. Protecting
the public from corrupt lawyers.

373
00:32:27,089 --> 00:32:31,685
You're skimming the surface.
You're not going after real power.

374
00:32:32,649 --> 00:32:36,562
Wow, that's scary.
What real power, Arthur?

375
00:32:36,729 --> 00:32:38,765
- You don't know?
- No. Tell me.

376
00:32:38,969 --> 00:32:42,245
Well, now we know
they're definitely safe.

377
00:32:45,849 --> 00:32:49,319
What makes you think
you know so goddamn much?

378
00:32:49,929 --> 00:32:52,159
- I don't know so much.
- No, tell me.

379
00:32:52,329 --> 00:32:55,287
What makes you
the great voice of authority?

380
00:32:56,089 --> 00:32:59,161
I don't pretend to be
a voice of authority.

381
00:33:03,889 --> 00:33:06,801
I just don't think
you knowwhat you're doing.

382
00:33:06,969 --> 00:33:08,846
Oh, I see.

383
00:33:11,969 --> 00:33:14,608
This is nice, don't you think?

384
00:33:14,769 --> 00:33:18,603
No, I don't find this
particularly nice, Arthur.

385
00:33:21,929 --> 00:33:26,081
I'm angry again, you know.
I don't like being angry.

386
00:33:26,249 --> 00:33:30,686
- It's not very pleasant.
- Why do you criticize me for what I do?

387
00:33:31,049 --> 00:33:35,122
I'm not criticizing you.
You're taking it too personally.

388
00:33:35,289 --> 00:33:38,281
The committee is doing something
about what's going on.

389
00:33:38,449 --> 00:33:43,159
We're not sitting in jail at nights
because of contempt of court.

390
00:33:43,409 --> 00:33:48,278
- Do you know what that's about?
- Yeah. You punched Judge Fleming.

391
00:33:48,529 --> 00:33:51,327
- You knowwhy?
- I have no idea. Tell me.

392
00:33:52,169 --> 00:33:56,162
I have a client who's in jail
because of a faulty tail light.

393
00:33:56,329 --> 00:33:59,048
- And I can't get him out.
- What do you mean?

394
00:33:59,609 --> 00:34:04,000
Do you want to hear a story about
our wonderful judicial system?

395
00:34:04,449 --> 00:34:05,928
Sure.

396
00:34:06,729 --> 00:34:11,245
A guy named Jeff McCullaugh
is going down a highway one night.

397
00:34:11,929 --> 00:34:16,002
And the cops stop him
because his tail light isn't working.

398
00:34:16,169 --> 00:34:20,048
They run a make on him.
The computer kicks back -

399
00:34:20,209 --> 00:34:24,885
- that a Jeff McCullaugh is wanted
for assault with a deadly weapon.

400
00:34:25,049 --> 00:34:27,085
- Was it the same guy?
- No.

401
00:34:27,249 --> 00:34:30,366
But he fits the description,
so they arrest him.

402
00:34:30,529 --> 00:34:32,406
Did he tell them
they had the wrong person?

403
00:34:32,569 --> 00:34:35,959
He tried.
He told the public defender.

404
00:34:36,129 --> 00:34:38,962
But he was too busy.
He never bothered to check.

405
00:34:39,129 --> 00:34:42,804
- Are you serious?
- Wait, it gets better.

406
00:34:43,329 --> 00:34:47,481
While Jeff is in jail,
a guard is stabbed -

407
00:34:48,449 --> 00:34:51,168
- and the knife is planted
in Jeff's cell.

408
00:34:51,329 --> 00:34:56,847
And Jeff is trialled on a new charge:
Assaulting a guard with a deadly weapon.

409
00:34:57,009 --> 00:35:02,447
And a trial date is set. Six months
from the time he was first picked up.

410
00:35:04,569 --> 00:35:07,527
I'll make a long story short.
Six months go by -

411
00:35:07,689 --> 00:35:11,602
- and a very shaky, very crazy
Jeff McCullaugh goes to court.

412
00:35:11,769 --> 00:35:17,605
The public defender tells Jeff
that he can get him off -

413
00:35:18,209 --> 00:35:21,997
- if he pleads guilty.
He'll make a deal with the judge.

414
00:35:22,169 --> 00:35:26,128
So he pleads guilty
even though he's innocent. Right.

415
00:35:26,289 --> 00:35:29,042
The deal was made
with a Judge Callahan.

416
00:35:29,249 --> 00:35:33,208
The day ofthe trial
Judge Callahan cannot be found.

417
00:35:34,049 --> 00:35:38,167
Fleming is in his place.
Fleming doesn't know about the deal.

418
00:35:40,449 --> 00:35:42,440
Jeff pleads guilty.

419
00:35:42,609 --> 00:35:46,488
Fleming sentences Jeff
to five years in prison.

420
00:35:49,849 --> 00:35:53,762
So, one little guy
has already spent -

421
00:35:53,929 --> 00:35:57,968
- a year and a half in jail
because his lights didn't work.

422
00:35:58,209 --> 00:36:02,964
I've spent the last year gathering
evidence to prove he's innocent.

423
00:36:03,129 --> 00:36:07,042
And I prove it.
I bring it all into Fleming's court -

424
00:36:07,209 --> 00:36:09,439
and he throws it out.

425
00:36:09,609 --> 00:36:12,681
- Why?
- It came in three days late.

426
00:36:16,289 --> 00:36:18,405
Holy shit!

427
00:36:20,289 --> 00:36:22,280
That's incredible.

428
00:36:22,449 --> 00:36:25,805
It's not incredible. It's Fleming.

429
00:36:28,529 --> 00:36:30,440
No, Arthur.

430
00:36:30,609 --> 00:36:34,124
That's the law.
You can't fault Fleming legally.

431
00:36:34,449 --> 00:36:37,964
Because he was going by
the letter ofthe law.

432
00:36:44,289 --> 00:36:46,644
- Are you kidding?
- No, I'm not.

433
00:36:46,809 --> 00:36:50,643
You talk to me like that
you won't get me into bed, dear.

434
00:36:52,129 --> 00:36:54,040
Yes, I will.

435
00:36:55,249 --> 00:36:57,763
I've had tougher cases.

436
00:36:59,529 --> 00:37:02,999
- You're so easy.
- You knew that, huh?

437
00:37:03,369 --> 00:37:06,964
That's why you went out with me.
Finish your egg roll.

438
00:37:11,329 --> 00:37:13,001
Arthur! Arthur!

439
00:37:13,289 --> 00:37:15,757
You'll never guess
who the police just grabbed.

440
00:37:15,929 --> 00:37:18,238
- Take a guess.
- Warren, please...

441
00:37:18,409 --> 00:37:22,482
This may sound crazy,
but Judge Fleming was just taken away.

442
00:37:22,649 --> 00:37:25,641
- What do you mean, taken away?
- Arrested.

443
00:37:27,049 --> 00:37:28,448
Come on.

444
00:37:28,609 --> 00:37:32,841
I'm telling you. They just arrested
your very own favourite judge.

445
00:37:33,009 --> 00:37:35,045
- Judge Fleming?
- Judge Fleming.

446
00:37:35,209 --> 00:37:38,565
What's the joke, Warren?
There's a joke connected to this.

447
00:37:38,729 --> 00:37:41,402
There is no joke.
I don't know what it's about.

448
00:37:41,569 --> 00:37:45,881
They're sitting on this very hard.
I can't get anything from anybody.

449
00:37:46,849 --> 00:37:48,521
Warren...

450
00:37:48,769 --> 00:37:50,805
Let me knowthe...

451
00:38:04,529 --> 00:38:08,442
- Judge, we're ready to reconvene.
- I'll be right there.

452
00:38:28,849 --> 00:38:30,965
Congratulations, Counsel.

453
00:38:31,129 --> 00:38:33,643
Thank you very much.
What did I do?

454
00:38:36,009 --> 00:38:38,045
Come here, come here.

455
00:38:43,889 --> 00:38:45,880
Judge Fleming.

456
00:38:46,049 --> 00:38:49,325
I was right. He was arrested
this morning and booked.

457
00:38:49,489 --> 00:38:52,322
- We know that.
- You'll never guess what for.

458
00:38:52,489 --> 00:38:54,605
- Take a guess.
- What for?

459
00:38:54,769 --> 00:38:59,285
Rape.
Fleming was booked on a rape.

460
00:38:59,449 --> 00:39:02,964
- I can't stand it.
- Isn't that the best?

461
00:39:03,689 --> 00:39:06,249
- Rape!
- I don't believe it.

462
00:39:06,409 --> 00:39:08,320
That's not the best.

463
00:39:08,849 --> 00:39:12,637
Oh, no. I'm gonna tell you
the punchline.

464
00:39:13,449 --> 00:39:16,964
You're gonna love this.
His people just called.

465
00:39:17,129 --> 00:39:21,281
Mr Fleming would like you
to represent him.

466
00:39:24,089 --> 00:39:25,363
Me?

467
00:39:29,089 --> 00:39:30,841
Me?

468
00:39:33,209 --> 00:39:34,927
Why me?

469
00:39:40,329 --> 00:39:42,126
I hate the son of a bitch.

470
00:39:46,049 --> 00:39:48,688
I'm going crazy!

471
00:39:53,609 --> 00:39:56,840
Mr Kirkland,
as you undoubtedly know, -

472
00:39:57,009 --> 00:40:00,558
- Judge Fleming has been accused,
falsely I might add, -

473
00:40:00,729 --> 00:40:05,120
- of sexually assaulting a young lady.
He wants you to represent him.

474
00:40:14,969 --> 00:40:16,288
Excuse me.

475
00:40:17,729 --> 00:40:21,119
- What, may I ask, is so funny?
- I just think it's...

476
00:40:21,649 --> 00:40:23,924
It's just crazy.

477
00:40:24,569 --> 00:40:26,639
I don't think it's so crazy.

478
00:40:27,209 --> 00:40:31,361
Two lawyers up in the third-floor
men's room think differently.

479
00:40:31,529 --> 00:40:37,161
Right now one ofthem is laughing
so hard he's choking in the sink.

480
00:40:38,129 --> 00:40:42,088
I'm aware that I'm not
particularly well liked.

481
00:40:42,329 --> 00:40:47,403
But the fact is that I'm innocent
and I will have that proven in court.

482
00:40:48,609 --> 00:40:51,487
Mr Bates and I feel,
in this particular situation, -

483
00:40:51,649 --> 00:40:54,846
- you would be perfect
to handle my defence.

484
00:40:55,049 --> 00:40:59,645
What is this? The two of you got
together and came up with that one.

485
00:40:59,809 --> 00:41:01,686
That's a beauty.

486
00:41:02,529 --> 00:41:06,761
The real question is: Why?
Why me, fellas?

487
00:41:07,809 --> 00:41:10,164
We need you for political reasons.

488
00:41:11,089 --> 00:41:14,877
Political reasons? What kind?

489
00:41:15,129 --> 00:41:18,883
This case will create
a lot of media coverage.

490
00:41:19,049 --> 00:41:24,567
The animosity between you and the judge
is well known. But we can use that.

491
00:41:24,729 --> 00:41:27,721
Why else defend a man
you dislike so much -

492
00:41:27,889 --> 00:41:31,802
- unless he was truly innocent?
And he is, you know.

493
00:41:32,129 --> 00:41:36,042
Remarkable. Remarkable.

494
00:41:36,729 --> 00:41:41,086
But personally
I don't give a shit.

495
00:41:44,409 --> 00:41:47,128
You smug son of a bitch!

496
00:41:47,369 --> 00:41:49,041
Henry! Henry!

497
00:41:51,289 --> 00:41:54,167
I've never committed a crime
in my life.

498
00:42:04,769 --> 00:42:09,479
Judge, ifyou're innocent,
truly innocent, -

499
00:42:09,929 --> 00:42:13,842
- you don't need me.
Get yourself another lawyer.

500
00:42:32,329 --> 00:42:34,365
What are you laughing at?

501
00:42:36,489 --> 00:42:39,003
I really hate
to tell you this, but -

502
00:42:39,929 --> 00:42:42,966
- you remind me a little
of my ex-husband.

503
00:42:50,369 --> 00:42:52,200
In what way?

504
00:42:53,169 --> 00:42:57,799
Because, during sex,
he would always say:

505
00:42:59,169 --> 00:43:01,922
"Go! Go!"

506
00:43:03,769 --> 00:43:05,282
"Go"?

507
00:43:06,769 --> 00:43:08,487
I don't say "go".

508
00:43:08,649 --> 00:43:12,278
- I heard you say "go".
- No, I don't say "go".

509
00:43:12,449 --> 00:43:14,963
"Go" is dumb.

510
00:43:16,489 --> 00:43:18,366
I say "God".

511
00:43:18,529 --> 00:43:20,997
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.

512
00:43:21,169 --> 00:43:24,445
I could have sworn
I heard a couple of go's.

513
00:43:24,609 --> 00:43:26,247
That was "God".

514
00:43:26,409 --> 00:43:29,446
I said "Ooooh..."
It sounded like "go".

515
00:43:29,689 --> 00:43:34,922
And then I said "God".
"Ooooh, God".

516
00:43:38,249 --> 00:43:39,841
Oh, God...

517
00:43:41,369 --> 00:43:44,008
Yeah? Who is it?

518
00:43:45,809 --> 00:43:48,118
Arthur, it's Jay!

519
00:43:49,729 --> 00:43:52,289
- Jay?
- What the hell...?

520
00:43:52,529 --> 00:43:54,247
It's my partner.

521
00:43:56,529 --> 00:43:59,327
Jay. Jay?

522
00:44:00,609 --> 00:44:02,486
All right, all right.

523
00:44:05,569 --> 00:44:10,006
What do you say?
Hell of a night tonight.

524
00:44:10,569 --> 00:44:14,960
- It's two o'clock in the morning.
- I know. The bars just closed.

525
00:44:15,129 --> 00:44:17,165
So, what are you doing here?

526
00:44:17,489 --> 00:44:20,799
- I came to ask you a question.
- Oh, yeah? What?

527
00:44:21,209 --> 00:44:24,042
- I'm a good lawyer, right?
- Right.

528
00:44:24,889 --> 00:44:29,804
- I got Earl Soames off, right?
- What are you talking about?

529
00:44:29,969 --> 00:44:33,803
I got Earl Soames...

530
00:44:33,969 --> 00:44:38,167
- Yeah, you got him off.
- I didn'tjust get him off.

531
00:44:38,729 --> 00:44:44,486
I got him off on murder.
And we all know Mr Soames did it.

532
00:44:44,769 --> 00:44:48,364
Right, he did it.
He was guilty. We all know that.

533
00:44:48,529 --> 00:44:51,362
Brilliant defence. Brilliant.

534
00:44:52,529 --> 00:44:55,646
- Brilliant defence, Arthur.
- Right.

535
00:44:55,809 --> 00:44:59,006
Brilliant. Brilliant!

536
00:44:59,289 --> 00:45:04,522
Brilliant!
I got him off on a technicality.

537
00:45:05,089 --> 00:45:07,967
I know, Jay. Right. Good.

538
00:45:11,449 --> 00:45:14,805
- Mr Soames did it again.
- What do you mean?

539
00:45:16,049 --> 00:45:19,564
At twelve o'clock tonight
he killed two kids.

540
00:45:20,929 --> 00:45:22,681
Oh, Jesus.

541
00:45:27,929 --> 00:45:31,046
He killed kids, you see.

542
00:45:31,889 --> 00:45:33,686
Oh, Jay...

543
00:45:38,249 --> 00:45:41,321
- I gotta take a piss.
- Jay...

544
00:45:46,369 --> 00:45:47,802
My partner.

545
00:45:47,969 --> 00:45:50,722
- There's women in here.
- Hello.

546
00:45:55,649 --> 00:45:57,765
Arthur, what's going on?

547
00:46:10,809 --> 00:46:15,360
Come on, it won't hurt you. Just duck.
You've got about three feet.

548
00:46:17,169 --> 00:46:19,364
For Christ's sake, get in.

549
00:46:20,529 --> 00:46:22,884
How are you feeling? Ready to go?

550
00:46:23,049 --> 00:46:27,008
I thought you flew planes.
With wings.

551
00:46:27,169 --> 00:46:31,208
I've been flying helicopters
ever since Korea. Get in.

552
00:46:37,049 --> 00:46:39,279
Button up. Close the door.

553
00:46:46,929 --> 00:46:52,049
I gotta tell you, Judge.
I'm not too happy about this.

554
00:46:53,049 --> 00:46:55,404
Just relax, Arthur.

555
00:46:59,929 --> 00:47:05,799
Could we maybe just go out a bit?
Kind ofjust go and hover?

556
00:47:06,049 --> 00:47:10,679
We'll do any goddamn thing you want.
Now hold on to your cojones.

557
00:47:14,929 --> 00:47:17,921
This is what it's all about!

558
00:47:26,809 --> 00:47:29,084
Pretty, isn't it?

559
00:47:30,489 --> 00:47:32,605
I don't want to talk.

560
00:47:35,969 --> 00:47:37,402
What?

561
00:47:38,209 --> 00:47:39,722
I don't want to talk.

562
00:47:42,929 --> 00:47:44,806
Did you ever skydive?

563
00:47:45,489 --> 00:47:48,606
- Did you ever skydive?
- No! Why?

564
00:47:49,649 --> 00:47:53,483
You oughta try it.
You might learn something.

565
00:47:53,969 --> 00:47:58,121
I was skydiving once
and my main chute didn't open.

566
00:47:58,289 --> 00:48:02,407
My reserve didn't open either.
There I was, plunging to the earth.

567
00:48:02,569 --> 00:48:05,402
As I hit the treetops
I discovered the meaning of life.

568
00:48:06,089 --> 00:48:10,719
- Which is?
- It sucks, Arthur. It really sucks.

569
00:48:16,209 --> 00:48:18,848
They used to keep
Native Dancer down there.

570
00:48:19,009 --> 00:48:22,684
Native Dancer, the horse.
They kept him down there.

571
00:48:23,609 --> 00:48:25,520
Beautiful animal.

572
00:48:27,689 --> 00:48:31,443
- Where are we going?
- Do you have any place in mind?

573
00:48:31,649 --> 00:48:34,402
Down. I would prefer to go down.

574
00:48:34,969 --> 00:48:40,805
Just relax and enjoy it, Arthur.
The old Chinese proverb.

575
00:48:49,649 --> 00:48:50,684
Great, isn't it?

576
00:48:52,689 --> 00:48:54,680
Oh, my!

577
00:48:55,129 --> 00:48:57,085
Let me showyou something.

578
00:49:01,809 --> 00:49:03,162
Look at that.

579
00:49:03,969 --> 00:49:05,925
Wild, isn't it?

580
00:49:15,809 --> 00:49:18,881
- We've hit it.
- Hit what? What did we hit?

581
00:49:19,689 --> 00:49:22,999
The halfway point.
There's a little game I play.

582
00:49:23,169 --> 00:49:28,641
I always calculate how far I can go
on the fuel I have and still get back.

583
00:49:29,729 --> 00:49:34,598
Then I figure out the halfway point
and I go just a little beyond it.

584
00:49:36,729 --> 00:49:40,199
You mean
we're beyond the halfway point?

585
00:49:43,769 --> 00:49:46,647
You mean
we're not gonna make it back?

586
00:49:47,649 --> 00:49:49,526
Maybe, maybe not.

587
00:49:49,689 --> 00:49:52,965
Well, land.
Land! Put it down!

588
00:49:53,329 --> 00:49:55,320
Come on, we're all right.

589
00:49:55,489 --> 00:50:00,119
Ifwe're beyond the halfway point
we're not all right. Land!

590
00:50:00,329 --> 00:50:03,241
Here we go! Heading back.

591
00:50:08,689 --> 00:50:12,762
Sixteen years of marriage and my wife
still won't eat Chinese food.

592
00:50:12,929 --> 00:50:17,207
It's crazy. Especially since
we met in a Chinese restaurant.

593
00:50:17,369 --> 00:50:19,087
How are we doing?

594
00:50:20,009 --> 00:50:22,887
Where are we? Are we back yet?

595
00:50:23,489 --> 00:50:25,207
Trust me, Arthur.

596
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:29,079
It's a protest. She relates
Chinese food to our marriage.

597
00:50:29,369 --> 00:50:32,839
We're not gonna make it back!

598
00:50:33,009 --> 00:50:37,480
I knew it! I knew it!
We're not gonna make it back!

599
00:50:39,049 --> 00:50:41,324
Arthur, look at that.

600
00:50:41,529 --> 00:50:44,760
I told you I had good instincts.

601
00:50:48,169 --> 00:50:51,605
Hang on, Arthur. Hang on now.
Hang on...

602
00:50:52,049 --> 00:50:56,247
Hang on, Arthur. We'll make it.
Hang on!

603
00:50:56,609 --> 00:50:59,840
Oh, God! Oh, God!

604
00:51:02,489 --> 00:51:05,367
Hang on! Hang on!

605
00:51:15,049 --> 00:51:16,721
Home free.

606
00:51:18,089 --> 00:51:20,808
We almost made it
right on the button.

607
00:51:21,449 --> 00:51:23,679
Another ninety feet.

608
00:51:24,609 --> 00:51:27,328
I told you I had good instincts.

609
00:51:28,889 --> 00:51:31,562
Come on, let's go ashore.

610
00:51:48,209 --> 00:51:50,598
Shit, my wheel.

611
00:51:57,489 --> 00:51:59,127
Come on, Arthur.

612
00:52:03,969 --> 00:52:07,439
It's easier when you
take the belt off. That's it.

613
00:52:12,529 --> 00:52:14,326
Are you all right?

614
00:52:14,489 --> 00:52:17,083
Come on, let's get some coffee.

615
00:52:21,849 --> 00:52:25,922
You'll be all right.
Your adrenaline's still charged.

616
00:52:26,809 --> 00:52:30,358
You have to admit
it makes you feel alive, vital.

617
00:52:32,809 --> 00:52:37,519
When I think
that we could be dead right now...

618
00:52:38,329 --> 00:52:42,322
Listen, why is everyone
so preoccupied with death?

619
00:52:43,169 --> 00:52:49,119
I'm not usually preoccupied with it,
but this seems like a valid time.

620
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:54,967
Another chicken salad sandwich.
Arthur?

621
00:52:55,489 --> 00:52:56,922
No.

622
00:52:58,369 --> 00:53:00,678
Let's get back to Fleming.

623
00:53:01,649 --> 00:53:05,688
- You won't consider taking his case?
- Nope. Not interested.

624
00:53:07,009 --> 00:53:09,239
You'd better be interested.

625
00:53:09,489 --> 00:53:13,607
There are some very powerful people
who can ruin your career.

626
00:53:15,489 --> 00:53:18,765
Ruin my career? What do you mean?

627
00:53:19,729 --> 00:53:22,880
For one they can have you disbarred.

628
00:53:24,609 --> 00:53:26,918
Do you want some more coffee?

629
00:53:28,969 --> 00:53:32,086
Disbarred?
What are you talking about?

630
00:53:32,649 --> 00:53:35,925
Did you ever have a client
named Ernest Drago?

631
00:53:36,089 --> 00:53:38,887
Drago, yeah. What about him?

632
00:53:39,209 --> 00:53:43,168
You gave the police information
that led to his conviction.

633
00:53:43,449 --> 00:53:47,761
Drago was a nut. Drago was insane.

634
00:53:48,249 --> 00:53:53,164
He sat in my office and rattled off
the most grotesque fantasies imaginable.

635
00:53:53,329 --> 00:53:57,527
I handled him on a burglary charge
and I heard that stuff every day.

636
00:53:57,689 --> 00:53:59,919
His favourite fantasy was:

637
00:54:00,089 --> 00:54:05,163
What would happen if he stuck
a firecracker in somebody's mouth?

638
00:54:05,329 --> 00:54:09,481
So, I read in the newspapers
that there was this nut -

639
00:54:09,649 --> 00:54:14,006
- who held people at gunpoint and
forced cherry bombs in their mouths.

640
00:54:14,169 --> 00:54:16,888
I knew it was Drago,
so I told the police.

641
00:54:17,769 --> 00:54:20,886
You didn't prevent a crime.
You betrayed a client.

642
00:54:21,129 --> 00:54:24,678
- You violated the code of ethics.
- What are you talking about?

643
00:54:24,849 --> 00:54:27,363
- What's going on?
- Arthur, they want you.

644
00:54:28,089 --> 00:54:32,287
You're a very principled lawyer
with no political ties.

645
00:54:35,849 --> 00:54:37,487
I tell ya...

646
00:54:37,689 --> 00:54:42,080
They want me to defend Fleming
because of my moral integrity.

647
00:54:42,249 --> 00:54:46,959
And if I don't defend him
I'll be disbarred for being unethical.

648
00:54:48,609 --> 00:54:54,047
Look, Arthur. Put aside your
personal feelings. Take the case.

649
00:54:54,689 --> 00:54:59,968
You've worked too hard.
Don't throw your career away.

650
00:55:01,609 --> 00:55:05,284
I can't believe this.
I just don't believe it.

651
00:55:11,929 --> 00:55:15,808
- Judge, I want McCullaugh freed.
- Nothing can be done.

652
00:55:16,009 --> 00:55:21,003
I don't buy that, Judge.
Just reopen the case.

653
00:55:21,169 --> 00:55:24,798
Reopen the case
and I'll get him acquitted.

654
00:55:25,049 --> 00:55:29,804
Now look. You are in no position
to ask for anything.

655
00:55:31,089 --> 00:55:34,923
But I'll see what I can do to help.

656
00:55:35,329 --> 00:55:38,685
Perhaps there's
an exception to the statute.

657
00:55:43,249 --> 00:55:44,841
Okay.

658
00:55:46,089 --> 00:55:49,968
Okay. So, why don't you
tell me about the girl?

659
00:55:51,009 --> 00:55:55,048
This Leah Shephard.
Can you tell me anything about her?

660
00:55:56,689 --> 00:56:01,479
What do you want to know? I saw her
a few times. She works at City Hall.

661
00:56:01,809 --> 00:56:06,087
- Did you have sex on the first date?
- Yes. First and second time.

662
00:56:06,249 --> 00:56:11,084
- That's why this makes no sense.
- What do you think happened to her?

663
00:56:12,809 --> 00:56:15,801
I assure you I did not rape her,
but...

664
00:56:16,169 --> 00:56:20,481
I really don't know. Maybe an angry
boyfriend showed up after I left.

665
00:56:20,649 --> 00:56:24,847
Angry boyfriend?
That's a little mild, don't you think?

666
00:56:25,129 --> 00:56:29,998
She wasn'tjust raped, she was
sadistically beaten and sodomized.

667
00:56:30,169 --> 00:56:32,683
That's a bit beyond angry boyfriend.

668
00:56:33,809 --> 00:56:36,198
You're right. I'm sorry.

669
00:56:39,889 --> 00:56:45,521
How did I get into this? I've been
involved in the law for thirty years.

670
00:56:45,689 --> 00:56:51,798
And I can't find five people
who'll believe I'm innocent.

671
00:56:52,089 --> 00:56:57,322
- Will you take a lie detector test?
- Why? It's not admissible evidence.

672
00:56:57,489 --> 00:57:00,959
I know. I would like you
to do it for me.

673
00:57:01,369 --> 00:57:03,280
- I'll think about it.
- No, no...

674
00:57:03,489 --> 00:57:07,277
- I said, I would think about it.
- You can't do this.

675
00:57:07,529 --> 00:57:11,363
I need a polygraph
to prepare your case.

676
00:57:11,569 --> 00:57:15,278
- If I'm going to be your lawyer...
- Ifyou're going to be?

677
00:57:16,929 --> 00:57:21,764
- Mr Kirkland, you are my lawyer.
- I know. I'm your lawyer.

678
00:57:21,929 --> 00:57:25,001
And as your lawyer
there are certain demands...

679
00:57:25,169 --> 00:57:30,197
As I said to you before,
you don't demand anything.

680
00:57:32,129 --> 00:57:35,166
Now sit down.
I have a lot ofwork to do.

681
00:57:37,929 --> 00:57:39,726
I said, sit down.

682
00:58:22,369 --> 00:58:24,041
Leave it out here.

683
00:58:53,689 --> 00:58:57,602
- Jeff, what happened to you?
- Somebody beat me up.

684
00:58:59,729 --> 00:59:02,801
- What for?
- I don't know. I didn't ask.

685
00:59:07,329 --> 00:59:09,923
Listen, I talked to Fleming.

686
00:59:10,089 --> 00:59:13,525
We'll work something out.
We'll get you out of here.

687
00:59:13,689 --> 00:59:15,247
When?

688
00:59:15,769 --> 00:59:21,048
It's gonna take maybe three weeks.
I promise I'll get you out by then.

689
00:59:22,209 --> 00:59:24,677
- Three weeks?
- That's the best I can do.

690
00:59:26,169 --> 00:59:28,888
- You must be kidding.
- It's the best I can do.

691
00:59:29,049 --> 00:59:33,281
- What am I supposed to do?
- You're gonna have to hang in there.

692
00:59:33,449 --> 00:59:36,282
- Just take care ofyourself.
- Take care?

693
00:59:36,449 --> 00:59:42,922
I got myself locked up in solitary to
get away from some guys. I can't fight.
