1
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,320
My sister Kate learned to swim

2
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:22,560
when most babies were still
in their playpens.

3
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,200
I adore her. Everybody does.

4
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,000
I wanted to name her after Saint Gobnet
the virgin beekeeper.

5
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,720
But mother, Mrs. Flax,
though I was a little peculiar.

6
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,280
I don't agree.

7
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,840
Mrs. Flax doesn't believe
in ritual or tradition.

8
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:26,800
Maybe.

9
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:32,760
I think so.

10
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:36,560
I'd wanted to repent since
I saw a girl with ashes on her forehead

11
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,360
cross herself and chant Hail Marys
before a spelling bee.

12
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:46,000
Charlotte, we're Jewish.

13
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,800
What's this?

14
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,280
Cheeseball pick-me-ups
and miniature franks.

15
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,120
And for desert, marshmallow-kabobs.

16
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,920
A word about Mrs. Flax and food.
The word is hors d'oeuvres.

17
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,000
"Fun Finger Foods"
is her main source book.

18
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,080
That's all she cooks.

19
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,880
Anything more, she says,
is too big a commitment.

20
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,560
It's Fred. How do I look?

21
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,640
Like a woman about to sin.

22
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:30,440
Good. Exactly the look I was hoping for

23
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:35,200
Don't wait up.

24
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:39,040
Mrs. Flax is dating her boss.

25
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,680
That means we'll be moving soon.

26
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,480
Wait a minute.

27
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:07,600
Not only am I not going on this trip
but you're taking another woman?

28
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,920
Honey, she's not just another woman.
She's my wife.

29
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:18,160
We've moved 18 times.

30
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,160
It gets easy to read the signs.

31
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,840
The lightning of
his terrible swft sword

32
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,040
This goose is marching on

33
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:29,880
Glory...

34
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,480
I feel I've wasted half my life in cars

35
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:45,320
I try to be charitable, looking
after Kate and not killing mother.

36
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:50,040
But who ever heard the word of God

37
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:04,040
President Kennedy arrived
in Hyannis Port today from Washington.

38
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:07,880
There to geet him
as his helicopter touched down

39
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,000
I don't think
He wanted those gifts they gave Him.

40
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,600
Frankenstein and birds?

41
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,280
No, sweetheart,
the 3 wise men brought the baby

42
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:26,120
Jesus Frankincense and Myrrh.

43
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:30,320
I know about these thing
but I choose to believe something else.

44
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,400
I have an idea. How about some fudge?

45
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,600
Do you want to make fudge?

46
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,400
I can't do anything until
I have everything the way it was.

47
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,760
The point of moving
is so things can be different.

48
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:46,520
I hate waking up
and not knowing where I am.

49
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:49,040
I'll put a sign above your bed saying:

50
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:52,480
"Good morning. You're in East Port.
Have a nice day."

51
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,920
I liked living in Oklahoma.

52
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:57,600
You'll love it here
when you got used to it.

53
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,920
And when you get used to it,
we'll move again.

54
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,160
Life is change.

55
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,960
Death is dwelling on the past
or staying in one place too long.

56
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,720
Remind me to get you
a decent pair of shoes.

57
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,960
I don't want any.

58
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:14,640
Don't be ridiculous.

59
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,880
All women want new shoes.

60
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,360
But those are from him.

61
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,720
Him? Oh, him.

62
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,800
Charlotte says he'll visit one day.

63
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,880
How will he know we're here?

64
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,080
The one thing
you can rely on about your father

65
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:30,920
is that he can't be relied on.

66
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:35,560
I only have one memory of my father.

67
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:39,400
At least, I think it was my father.

68
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:52,760
Honey, it's an eclipse. Put these on.

69
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:09,160
One day he'll come back.
I just hope he can find us.

70
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,680
Dear God, please
don't let us be leaving right away.

71
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,600
Please let me stop lying all the time.

72
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,960
Please don't let me fall
in love so much.

73
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,840
Please let someone fall in love back.

74
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,680
And please send me a sign.

75
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:28,520
Amen.

76
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:53,080
"Maintenance man
for apartment house or hotel."

77
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,200
"Experienced mechanic.
Sheet metal worker."

78
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,400
You drive like old people make love.

79
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:06,000
Mom, I'm only fifteen. I get nervous.

80
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,800
Driving is one of a woman's
most important skills.

81
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,120
You're lucky I taught you early.

82
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,600
This sounds good.

83
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:18,080
"Bright, personable,
cheerful, young secretary

84
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,080
required by small law firm."

85
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,040
Why are you signaling?

86
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:25,880
The turn is 2 miles away.
Just pull over here.

87
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,400
Step on it!

88
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:31,240
Blow it out your ear!

89
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,480
Johnny Angel

90
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,680
Johnny Angel

91
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,480
You're an angel to me

92
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:56,720
I just wondered
if you got moved in all right.

93
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,040
Yeah, we moved in fine.

94
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:03,200
I'm Joe Peretti. I work up the hill.

95
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,040
So if you need anything done, ma'am...

96
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,120
"Ma'am?"

97
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,440
What exactly is up the hill,
Mr. Peretti?

98
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:18,280
The convent.
Protectors of the Blessed Souls.

99
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:22,160
This is a sign. Thank you, God.
This is a real sign.

100
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,560
Our nearest neighbours are nuns?

101
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:29,400
I suppose you think
this is divine providence.

102
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:33,040
You know, there is one small thing.

103
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,560
That porch swing up there.

104
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,560
I can't reach it.

105
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:40,360
Okay. I'll take a look.

106
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:53,560
So, Joe, how old did you say you were?

107
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,880
26 and cute as a button.

108
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,720
Too bad you want to be a nun.

109
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:07,480
I think you might be old enough
for a boyfriend now.

110
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:10,640
If I'm old enough,
maybe you're too old.

111
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:14,480
Don't be ridiculous.
A real woman is never too old.

112
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:39,640
Please, God, don't let me fall in love
and want to do disgusting things.

113
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:51,080
Dear God, I love the way he throws.

114
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:08,320
Come on.

115
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,960
I'm taking my fiancee to lunch.

116
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:17,920
I expect you to be here when I return.

117
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:21,080
How are those depositions coming?

118
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:24,920
They'll be ready.

119
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:30,480
Assholes.

120
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,120
Do you like your new boss?

121
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,400
No, I don't. Did you make the list?

122
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:47,680
Kate needs a swimsuit,
I need notebooks, pens and underwear.

123
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,200
I have 30 minutes for lunch.

124
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:53,000
After we get the shoes,
I'll give you money to buy the rest.

125
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,280
I want red ones. Bright red ones.

126
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,640
With a red strap.

127
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:59,280
I don't need any.

128
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:03,120
Charlotte, you're starting school
on Monday and those boots aren't.

129
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,720
What's wrong with them?
Everything.

130
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,440
I'll be right with you.

131
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:20,280
Hail Mary, full of grace.

132
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,800
You must be Mrs. Flax.

133
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,640
Joseph told us that a nice
Jewish family were our new neighbours.

134
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,600
Welcome to East Port.

135
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,720
Oh, God, please
let Mrs. Flax control herself.

136
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,440
You're still a perfect seven,
Reverend Mother.

137
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,480
You know, most women's feet get bigger.

138
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,040
Only if they marry.

139
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,960
Your feet swell.

140
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:53,200
During pergnancy your feet swell.

141
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,160
How could she?

142
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:58,320
Mine got swollen during pregnancy.

143
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:02,160
Mother, how could you say that?
She's a holy vessel.

144
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,600
What a lovely red shoe.

145
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:09,360
Thank you.

146
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,280
Where are you from?

147
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:14,880
I used to live in South Dakota myself.

148
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,720
Can you imagine trying to keep kosher
in South Dakota?

149
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:23,200
I can't imagine keeping kosher anywhere

150
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,800
Will that be all, Reverend Mother?
Only one new addition?

151
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,440
Every year, fewer and fewer of us now.

152
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:36,120
Nice to meet you, Mrs. Flax.

153
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:39,520
I hope you enjoy living in East Port.

154
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,920
Yes, dear?

155
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:44,760
I wanted to ask what color her bra was
and if she always had pure thoughts.

156
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:51,920
Good-bye.

157
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:18,560
She's got a pair she likes.
What about you?

158
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:22,400
I don't need any.

159
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,840
Nice boots.

160
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,200
Maybe we'll meet at
Parent/Teacher night.

161
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:39,040
Maybe we will.

162
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:43,640
I'd like that.

163
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,960
Come on, Miss Katydid,
you'll be late for registration.

164
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:04,760
'Bye, Sergeant.
'Bye, fish head.

165
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:14,360
Well, well,
look who's driving the school bus.

166
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:23,120
Why, Charlotte,
I believe you're blushing.

167
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,840
Come on.
Don't make such a big deal about it.

168
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:49,440
Put it in your mouth and smoke it.

169
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,880
I'll throw up all over.

170
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,840
How was your date
with Scott Jones, Mary?

171
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,680
He's an animal.

172
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,160
So, you had a good time?

173
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,760
We had oral sex by the railway trestle.

174
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:04,240
I love it when they groan. Don't you?

175
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,520
You're going get into trouble.

176
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:10,360
I know. I can't wait.

177
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:16,560
The bell rang five minutes ago.

178
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:20,400
If she tells my mother, I'm dead.

179
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:45,600
Noree?
Here.

180
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,440
We have a new student today,
Charlotte Flax.

181
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,360
I'm sure you'll do your best
to make her feel welcome.

182
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:58,200
Charlotte, right down there.

183
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,800
Charlotte... Flax, right?

184
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,320
Talk to me, Joe. Please, talk to me.

185
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:26,040
So, how do you like the house?

186
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:29,880
Sorry?

187
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,320
How do you like the house?

188
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,480
I hate the house.

189
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,000
I was born there.

190
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,400
I love that house.
You were?

191
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,800
Under the kitchen table.

192
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:46,160
God strike me down,
that's as good as a manger.

193
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:50,000
Give me strength not to sit on his lap.

194
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:55,560
So was that you who carved
"Red Sox" on the door?

195
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,640
That was my room.

196
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,520
I'm in his room.

197
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:04,320
When my mother died, I sat on my bed
for two days holding her seater.

198
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:08,200
I didn't care about anything,
not even the Red Sox.

199
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,200
I'm going to burn in hell for sure.

200
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:14,040
He's talking about his dead mother
and I'm wishing he was undoing my dress

201
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:26,280
That'll be Carrie. She sells cosmetics.

202
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:30,440
She's going to love my mom.

203
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:40,320
I was wondering...

204
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:44,160
What do people do here on the weekends?

205
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:49,280
Sunday's my day off.
Sometimes I go fishing.

206
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,840
Really?

207
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,000
I love to fish.

208
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,840
Well, sometimes
I just sit by the water and think.

209
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:03,600
That sounds great too.

210
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,320
Maybe you and your sister...

211
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:10,160
Well, Kate's actually scared
of the water.

212
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,280
But I'd love to.

213
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:21,120
Well, I drive right by here
on my way to the cliff so...

214
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,600
What time?

215
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,800
Seven.

216
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,040
Okay. That sounds great.

217
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:30,880
Okay, I'll wait for you.

218
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,520
Know your colors and your fabrics.

219
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:45,200
That's what I tell all my little girls.

220
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,760
Honey, I would kill to have your hair.

221
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:51,480
Swimming's fine for you figure,
but it damages your hair.

222
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,480
Got anything for sharks and jellyfish?

223
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,520
She means body grease.

224
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,320
She's going to swim the English Channel

225
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:02,120
Well, I'm not sure I have exactly
what you're looking for... but try this.

226
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:09,880
It was meant for crow's-feet,
but it never caught on.

227
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:13,800
You are finished.

228
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:17,640
Try the other side.

229
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,680
Tell me about
that caretaker at the convent.

230
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:25,280
You mean Joey?
Is he handsome or is he handsome?

231
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,160
In high school...

232
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:29,840
no one could touch the golden boy
on a football field.

233
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:33,360
Then in the middle of
his senior year he lost it.

234
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,840
He couldn't run to save his life.

235
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:39,680
His girlfriend had just left town,
kind of sudden.

236
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:44,640
My theory? I believe there's a little
Joey Junior walking around.

237
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:48,640
I'd chase him myself if
I wasn't married to a real son-of-a-gun

238
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:54,160
Joey, Joey, Joey, entering a convent
for the sin of getting a girl pregnant.

239
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,920
A penitent man.
Makes me love you even more.

240
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:01,760
You have very special eyes.

241
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:06,600
Only you and Liz Taylor
can get away with those eyebrows.

242
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:10,440
Let's put some color on you.

243
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:15,280
This one's planning to be a nun.

244
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:26,440
A difficult age.
All Charlotte's ages are difficult.

245
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:34,160
What's so special about
this Parent/Teacher night?

246
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,720
You read the invitation.

247
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:39,120
Community begins in the classroom.
I am your mother.

248
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,960
It is my job o supervise your education

249
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,840
There's so little of it left.
What took you so long?

250
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,600
We going to play my favorite game?

251
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,000
Who's the worst mother in the world?

252
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,400
Don't tell me. Let's me guess.

253
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:55,200
Who could it be? Me?!

254
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:59,160
Okay, I'll make you a deal.

255
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:02,680
You stop being a little bitch
for an hour or two

256
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:06,000
and I won't knock the religion
of your choice for a week.

257
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,840
Deal.

258
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:13,240
Who's that?
My history teacher. He's nice.

259
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,040
He's an asshole.

260
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:17,040
You haven't spoken to him yet.

261
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:19,760
I don't need to speak to him.

262
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:23,560
He's driving an Edsel, for Chris sake.

263
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:32,920
We can't beat Stockton's Little League
if you don't release him.

264
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:36,760
Agendas are here and refreshments are

265
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:42,600
Hi. I'm glad you came tonight.

266
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:46,400
You have 2 weeks, I need one day.
I'll think about it.

267
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:50,280
Hi. Is your mom here?

268
00:24:56,920 --> 00:25:00,760
How are you?
Good. I'm even better now.

269
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,080
Are any of these yours?

270
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:06,880
No. Mine are grown and long gone.

271
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:12,040
Where's Mrs. Landsky tonight?

272
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,720
She's long gone too.

273
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:16,200
Oh, you're a widower.

274
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:20,040
No, she's just gone.

275
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:23,600
Some punch?

276
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:27,440
She just up and left one day right
in the middle of vacuuming.

277
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:31,680
Didn't even switch the damn thing off.

278
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,280
Is there a Mr. Flax?

279
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:45,160
No. He too made a rather sudden
and unexpected departure.

280
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,320
Was he vacuuming?

281
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,240
No. I was in labor with Charlotte.

282
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,120
Yeah, and to add insult to injury

283
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:54,720
the son-of-a-bitch stole
my car to leave in.

284
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:58,240
A red Buick convertible
with white sidewall tires.

285
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,320
It still pisses me off.

286
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,560
It's obvious it means a lot to you.

287
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,360
The first time

288
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:07,120
I got behind the wheel of that car
I thought, "This is heaven."

289
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,080
Cars mean freedom.

290
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:11,920
If you hate a place, you can get in
your car, poof, you're gone.

291
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:16,000
So your first love was a Buick.

292
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,840
Yeah, before I met my husband.

293
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,840
Big mistake. One of many.

294
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:23,240
Are we talking cars or men?

295
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:27,040
I don't know.
Both have taken me for a ride.

296
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:35,520
I try not to get too involved with
women before the World Series starts

297
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:43,960
but for you I'd make an exception.

298
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,640
Is that a compliment?

299
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:50,480
Oh, yes. I would really
like to know you a whole lot better.

300
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:54,040
So call me Lou.

301
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:57,880
So, Lou, call me.

302
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:01,480
How about Sunday? I'm free all day.

303
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:04,400
How about breakfast?

304
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,440
Great.

305
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:08,280
I'll bring bagels.

306
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:12,120
I'll be there.
So will I.

307
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:15,120
Do you see that woman?

308
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,400
That's my mom.

309
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:21,240
But when I grow up
I want to be just like yours.

310
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:28,040
Mary, you already are.

311
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,760
I'll make real sandwiches.

312
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:39,560
Big ones a man can sink his teeth into
and use both hands to hold them.

313
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:45,680
He's late.
Oh, God, please don't let him forget.

314
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:48,120
Be as patient as Saint Bridget,

315
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:50,680
lady in waiting to
Queen Blanche of Namur.

316
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:54,280
It's after seven, Charlotte. He's late.

317
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:56,400
I won't start the day with an argument.

318
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:59,440
I'll tally up my evil thoughts
for the week and ignore her.

319
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:03,240
When a man's late,
it's time to clear the decks.

320
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:28,040
What?!

321
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:35,600
Forget it! Never mind!

322
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:47,400
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

323
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:52,400
Or don't do anything I would.

324
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:13,000
Rachel Flax.

325
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,880
I want to scream
out the window like a maniac.

326
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:30,840
"I'm running away
with the caretaker man!"

327
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:34,120
My speedometer is broken.
I'm trying not to drive too fast.

328
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:37,920
After my mom nothing seems fast.

329
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:41,200
Now my lips are touching his.

330
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,400
She seems like a nice person.

331
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:47,200
Oh, yeah, she is. And a wonderful mom.

332
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:01,120
Gott in Himmel.

333
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,920
I never saw anybody
treat a bagel this way.

334
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,320
Where were you raised?

335
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:09,160
Believe it or not,
my parents owned a kosher bakery.

336
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:11,080
They made me crazy, of course.

337
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:14,000
The night that I ran away
I stood in the kitchen

338
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,520
cigarette in one hand,
ham sandwich in another.

339
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,840
Why were you running away?

340
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:22,680
I had my high school diploma,
my first pay check. Why stay?

341
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,200
Hi. 'Bye.

342
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,000
Wait a minute.

343
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,840
'Bye, Mom.

344
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,840
Where'd you meet your husband?

345
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:40,640
In a writing class. He liked my poems.

346
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,600
So we moved into a one-room apartment.

347
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:48,440
It was a dump, but standing
on a chair you could see Lake Michigan.

348
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,120
It must have been tough when he left,
raising a kid on your own.

349
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:55,960
I coped.

350
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,760
Who was Kate's father?

351
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:04,480
Are you always this nosy?

352
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,920
Small-twon boy.

353
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:08,720
I like to know other people's business.
Do you mind?

354
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:12,160
No. When I mind, you'll know.
It'll be obvious.

355
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:14,240
So who was he?

356
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,560
I never caught his name.

357
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:20,360
He was in St. Louis for a swim meet.
He had Olympic aspirations.

358
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,640
You were on the same team?

359
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:25,600
No, I was the maid in his hotel.

360
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:29,440
One night...
I delivered more than his towels.

361
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,760
You're a hell of a woman.

362
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,920
I know.

363
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:41,560
It's been a memorable breakfast.
I'm glad you like it.

364
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:45,400
I didn't say I liked it.
But I'll never forget it.

365
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:49,760
I'm sorry. No offense.
None taken.

366
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:55,680
What do you want to do?
We've got all day.

367
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:04,560
You want to go out?

368
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:17,880
Do you want to go out?

369
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:22,320
Not really. No.

370
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,960
Do you want to go out?

371
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:28,800
I'm fine.

372
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:33,240
Tell me about the nuns in the convent.

373
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,960
Do they wear underwear in the shower?

374
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,920
I don't believe I said that.

375
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:40,440
I'm always too embarrassed
to take a shower after gym.

376
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:44,280
Mary O'Brien dances naked, screaming
about her boyfriend's quivering loins.

377
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:49,240
Shut up, Charlotte. Shut up.

378
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:53,080
The boat's down there.

379
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,760
Please, God,
let him throw me on the ground

380
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:59,600
and make another Joey, Junior.

381
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,120
You okay?

382
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:07,960
I'm fine, thanks.

383
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:18,960
I do want to be good and virtuous,
but it isn't easy.

384
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,720
Do you want to bait your hook
or shall I do it?

385
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:48,520
Mary, Mother of God,
he still wants to fish.

386
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:57,680
What's funny?
You're a sexy guy.

387
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,440
Do you have to look surprised?

388
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,920
I am surprised.

389
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:05,360
Sometimes age his its compensations.

390
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:08,360
Well, I wouldn't go that far.

391
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:12,080
It's been ages since I've felt his good

392
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,440
How long?

393
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,920
Too long.

394
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:17,600
You haven't been with other women?

395
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,960
You're lying.

396
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,880
I am?
Trust me, I know about these things.

397
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:24,360
Okay.

398
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,960
I'm lying

399
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,360
I don't care.

400
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,960
Well, that's a shame.

401
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:32,240
Lying's my main thing. I'll miss it.

402
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:33,840
In my experience...

403
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:36,000
Which is considerable.

404
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,480
Men lie about everyhign.
But women don't.

405
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:42,320
I don't know about women, but I don't.

406
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:45,880
But from me you expect it.
Absolutely.

407
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:49,720
Well, when you expect the worst
from people they usually deliver.

408
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:52,960
Are you always aggressive after sex?

409
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:56,800
You call this aggressive?

410
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:00,640
Oh, yeah. Hey, this is fun.

411
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:04,880
Can we do it again Friday?
You don't waste time do you?

412
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:05,920
Life's too short.

413
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,720
I'm sorry I got old before I noticed.

414
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:11,120
I'm never growing old.

415
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:13,160
Time catches up. What can you do?

416
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:16,960
Keep moving.

417
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,960
I had a good time.

418
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:34,400
Me too.

419
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:38,240
Kiss me, Joe. Please kiss me.

420
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:43,680
Good night.

421
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,480
How was your date?

422
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:25,280
Fine.

423
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,040
We had a good time.

424
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:29,120
So did we.

425
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,400
I hate when she does that.

426
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,320
She wants to break the world's record.

427
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:37,120
If she's not up in 10 seconds,
call an ambulance.

428
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,400
When will you see him again?

429
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,600
I don't know.

430
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,960
If I were you, I'd go easy.

431
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:46,120
I know you help on a celibate life,

432
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:49,920
but that might be tough
with half my genes.

433
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:54,200
Yuck! Five seconds off.

434
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,560
I must stop having impure thoughts.

435
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:16,360
I don't take the bus to school anymore,
but that doesn't help.

436
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:21,120
Maybe if I discover why I love him,
the sick feeling will go away.

437
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:23,920
I love him.
He has the most beautiful skin.

438
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,880
He wears moccaasins in winter

439
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:30,720
even though his feet must feel like ice

440
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:43,200
Trick or treat!

441
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:48,920
Yes, I've got wonderful prizes for you.

442
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,960
Toothpaste?!

443
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:54,040
All right, it's magic toothpaste.

444
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:56,400
Magic toothpaste.

445
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:00,240
Wait, wait! Miss Kate! In the house.

446
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:03,400
Come on, Mom!
Put your goldfish lips in the house.

447
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:07,200
'Bye!

448
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:16,040
They're big.

449
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:21,360
All right, team! Yeah!

450
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:31,160
Swimmers meet! Quiet please!

451
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:34,640
Swimmers on the block.

452
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:38,440
Take your marks.

453
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:43,800
An Esther Williams!

454
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,680
What do I have?
Soap?

455
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:49,480
Mrs. Flax! Coach Parker.
It's so nice to meet you!

456
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,160
We are so proud of Kate.

457
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,480
I think she has Olympic potential.

458
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,880
That probably doesn't surprise you.
Not at all.

459
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,880
Did she get it from you?
Not at all.

460
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:02,720
Nice job.
Thanks, Coach.

461
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:05,280
Hi, Mrs. Crain! 'Bye, coach!

462
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:08,880
'Bye, dear!

463
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:12,560
They're terrible.

464
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:16,160
I said painting was my passion,
not that I was good.

465
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,880
Girls, back me up here.

466
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:22,720
Did either of you hear me
tell your mother I had talent?

467
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:26,800
I rest my case.

468
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:30,640
Now stop being a pain in the ass critic
and pose for me.

469
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,200
If you paint me like that, you're dead.

470
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,800
Trust me.

471
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,320
Girls, follow me.

472
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:41,120
Already I feel inspired.

473
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:45,160
I'll show you where you're sleeping.

474
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,600
Forgive my abruptness,

475
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:58,120
but when the Muse calls,
the artist must jump.

476
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:00,640
Good night.

477
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:04,480
He's nuts-o.

478
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,600
I did Sophia from memory.

479
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:23,440
I never worked with a live one before.

480
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:25,960
This is fun.

481
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:29,760
Don't you think this is fun?

482
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:32,440
Oh, Cleo, baby.

483
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:36,280
That is not very regal.

484
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:26,640
Sometimes I feel like you're the child
and I'm the grownup.

485
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:32,640
I can't imagine being inside you.

486
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,800
I can't imagine being anywhere

487
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:39,640
you'd let me stay
for nine straight months.

488
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,640
What's wrong with this picture?

489
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,600
Compliments of Mrs. Landsky.

490
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:07,320
It seems she froze Lou's meals
for the next decade.

491
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:08,360
Good morning.

492
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:10,800
Good morning.

493
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,120
What a morning!

494
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:14,640
This is for you
Thank you.

495
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,920
How are you? Did you weather the storm?

496
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:20,760
Yeah. Fine, thanks.

497
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:28,080
This is how you normally eat?

498
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:45,520
The time is autumn, 1621.

499
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:49,360
The place is Plymouth Plantation:
An English colony in Massachusetts.

500
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:55,720
This is a harvest feast; a thanksgiving

501
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:00,240
The Englishmen have invited
their neighbors, the Indians

502
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:03,120
Oh, God.

503
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:06,000
For games and contests of skill.

504
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,520
Oh, dear God.

505
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:13,080
What is it? What happened?

506
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:16,840
The President's been shot!

507
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:20,280
The President's been shot!

508
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:24,120
Benny, turn that off!

509
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:30,480
Governor Connelly
was struck in the chest.

510
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:34,280
Unconfirmed reports say the President
was hit in the head.

511
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:35,800
That's an unconfirmed report.

512
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:39,600
The President's wife was not hurt.

513
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:43,440
She entered the hospital
at Kennedy's side.

514
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:47,280
A newsman said he was riding behind
the President in the parade.

515
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:49,120
After the shots were fired,

516
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:52,960
he looked up at the 6th floor
of the Texas Book Depository.

517
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,200
He saw the rifle pulled back in.

518
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:57,520
I want my father.

519
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:00,560
Please God, I want to talk to my father

520
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:03,240
20 feet away when it happened.

521
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:06,960
Tell us exactly what you saw, sir.

522
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:08,080
He was coming down the street.

523
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:11,880
My 5-year-old and myself
were by ourselves on Palmer Street.

524
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,920
I waved, and the m...

525
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:16,080
The man...

526
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:18,000
That's all right.

527
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,760
Go ahead.

528
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:22,160
As he was waving, a shot rang out.

529
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:23,360
He slumped down.

530
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:25,520
His wife reached up toward him.

531
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:27,600
He was slumping down

532
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:31,120
and the second shot went off
and knocked him down.

533
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:32,640
Two shots?

534
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:33,360
Did you see who...

535
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:34,040
I did not see the man who did it.

536
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:37,880
I'm sorry.

537
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:42,000
I can't help more, but I won't forget.

538
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,880
Here is a flash
from the Associated Press.

539
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:46,160
Dateline: Dallas.

540
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:49,520
Two priests who were
with the President say

541
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:50,960
he is dead of bullet wounds.

542
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:52,480
There is no confirmation.

543
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:56,320
This is what we have on a flash basis
from the Associated Press.

544
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:59,080
We have two men...

545
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:02,600
who administered the last rites
of the Catholic Church to the President

546
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:06,400
President Kennedy
has been assassinated. It's official.

547
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:09,320
The President is dead.

548
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:12,480
Women here in shock. Some have fainted.

549
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:15,440
Two Secret Servicemen,
standing by the Emergency Room

550
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:18,120
tears streaming down their faces.

551
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:21,920
There's only one word to describe
the picture here and that's grief.

552
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:28,400
It's official. It just came in:

553
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:32,200
The President
of the United States is dead.

554
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:37,600
It feels like there isn't a single
adult left on the entire planet.

555
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:46,080
Oh, God, what are you doing?

556
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:49,920
How could you let this happen?

557
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:55,720
I miss my father.

558
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:58,480
Is he watching television?

559
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:02,320
Maybe he's in Brazil
and doesn't know what's happened.

560
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:42,600
The old man who did this job
before me had Indian ways.

561
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:50,000
He could stand so quiet.

562
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,800
His heels together like a little dancer

563
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,800
The world's gone crazy.

564
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:54,520
My Father, who art in Heaven...

565
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:56,400
Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done...

566
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:57,880
Forgive us our trespasses

567
00:47:57,880 --> 00:47:59,600
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

568
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:03,440
Lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil. Amen.

569
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:09,080
In 1990 the space age will enter
it's 2nd phase

570
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:14,520
and our hopes in it
to preserve the peace

571
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:16,400
to make sure
that in this great new sea

572
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:20,240
as on earth,
the United States is second to none.

573
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:30,000
Everyone's crying about the President.

574
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,080
I've become a fallen woman
and no one can tell.

575
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:35,200
I've been as bad as I can be.

576
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:39,040
I should be burned at the stake.

577
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:45,200
Bless me, for I have sinned.

578
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:47,080
And in a holy place.

579
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:48,560
I kissed him.

580
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:49,640
I will starve myself

581
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:53,440
until I purge every sinful thought
about Joe from my soul.

582
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:05,840
The saints never go unpunished.

583
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:07,680
Joan of Arc burned at the stake.

584
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:10,640
So what will you do to me, Lord?

585
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:13,520
Flagellation? Mutilation?

586
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:17,360
I bumped into Mr. Crain
leaving Sammy's house.

587
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:19,120
That witch?

588
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:20,000
Dinner!

589
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
Think about it. Get back to me.

590
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:22,760
He's wants a baby.

591
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:26,560
I bet he's trying a love potion.

592
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,520
I wish I had trouble conceiving.

593
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:31,360
I get pregnant
if I hang my clothes near a man's suit.

594
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:35,200
Oh, Lord, no. Anything but that.

595
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:46,920
No more fasting.
You're driving me crazy.

596
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:48,080
I'm pregnant.

597
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:50,960
Lord, how could you be so strict?

598
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:54,240
Are you okay?

599
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:58,080
Eat and get some rest
and we'll talk about this tomorrow.

600
00:50:02,625 --> 00:50:06,065
Mary didn't even kiss Joseph
and look what happened.

601
00:50:06,065 --> 00:50:09,865
Oh, Lord, what have I done?

602
00:50:20,665 --> 00:50:24,505
Can I talk to you?
Sure.

603
00:50:29,785 --> 00:50:33,585
Well?

604
00:50:40,745 --> 00:50:44,465
Hello? Is there anybody there?

605
00:50:44,465 --> 00:50:47,705
Just give me a second. I'm trying.

606
00:50:47,705 --> 00:50:49,865
I want to tell you.

607
00:50:49,865 --> 00:50:53,465
I may be pregnant
with the next Jewish-Italian messiah.

608
00:50:53,465 --> 00:50:56,105
Nothing.

609
00:50:56,105 --> 00:50:58,585
What is the matter with you?

610
00:50:58,585 --> 00:51:00,425
What is happening in your brain

611
00:51:00,425 --> 00:51:03,185
when you just sit there,
not moving, not speaking?

612
00:51:03,185 --> 00:51:06,985
What? What?

613
00:51:11,065 --> 00:51:14,745
Dad, you're the only one who can help
and you're never here.

614
00:51:14,745 --> 00:51:18,585
Where are you?

615
00:51:40,385 --> 00:51:41,545
Joe doesn't know where she is.

616
00:51:41,545 --> 00:51:45,385
She's angry. That's okay.
Blowing off steam, that's okay.

617
00:51:46,105 --> 00:51:47,785
Taking my car is not okay.

618
00:51:47,785 --> 00:51:49,865
That's going too far.

619
00:51:49,865 --> 00:51:52,705
Did she say
that anything was bothering her?

620
00:51:52,705 --> 00:51:53,705
I'm her mother.

621
00:51:53,705 --> 00:51:57,545
If something bothers her,
I'm the last person she'll tell.

622
00:51:57,785 --> 00:52:01,465
She's a teenager.
I'm amazed she talks at all.

623
00:52:01,465 --> 00:52:03,185
Where is she?

624
00:52:03,185 --> 00:52:06,425
Onward Christian soldiers

625
00:52:06,425 --> 00:52:10,225
I want to lead a violent
and exciting life!

626
00:53:14,465 --> 00:53:18,305
Excuse me.
I seem to be having engine trouble.

627
00:53:18,585 --> 00:53:22,145
Who is it?
It's just a young girl.

628
00:53:22,145 --> 00:53:25,265
I'm a shepherd who's lost my flock.

629
00:53:25,265 --> 00:53:27,265
Your folks know where you are?

630
00:53:27,265 --> 00:53:29,345
They know exactly where I am.

631
00:53:29,345 --> 00:53:33,105
Especially my dad.
He's that kind of guy.

632
00:53:33,105 --> 00:53:36,825
Charlotte,
you're talking like a crazy person.

633
00:53:36,825 --> 00:53:40,345
I'm glad you're here,
but you don't need to stay.

634
00:53:40,345 --> 00:53:42,425
I'll always be here for you.

635
00:53:42,425 --> 00:53:45,625
Okay, I won't always be here for you.
Just sometimes.

636
00:53:45,625 --> 00:53:48,065
If I feel like it,
or if I'm in the neighborhood.

637
00:53:48,065 --> 00:53:50,825
She's doing this to turn my hair white.

638
00:53:50,825 --> 00:53:54,665
She has a problem
and she's too frightened to tell you.

639
00:53:54,905 --> 00:53:56,625
Why would she be frightened?

640
00:53:56,625 --> 00:53:59,545
Rachel, you can be a little abrasive!

641
00:53:59,545 --> 00:54:02,425
Even I'm scared
to talk to you sometimes!

642
00:54:02,425 --> 00:54:05,185
She's a kid! Don't ride her too hard.

643
00:54:05,185 --> 00:54:06,425
Don't lecture me on parenting!

644
00:54:06,425 --> 00:54:09,505
When she comes, I'm leaving.

645
00:54:09,505 --> 00:54:12,825
You wonder why she runs away?
Listen to yourself!

646
00:54:12,825 --> 00:54:13,465
Are we fighting?

647
00:54:13,465 --> 00:54:17,265
Why?!
It relieves the tension!

648
00:54:19,105 --> 00:54:21,465
The discotheques, which are nightclubs

649
00:54:21,465 --> 00:54:25,305
have been very popular
in Europe and South America for years.

650
00:54:25,785 --> 00:54:28,185
Paris has about 100 of them.

651
00:54:28,185 --> 00:54:31,985
This is the frug a combination twist
and hitchhike.

652
00:54:32,025 --> 00:54:35,225
That's Killer Joe,
society's favorite dancing teacher.

653
00:54:35,225 --> 00:54:39,025
Killer Joe is also available
as a party stimulator.

654
00:54:48,425 --> 00:54:52,265
Do you like pancakes?

655
00:54:54,585 --> 00:54:58,425
A real, live father actually living in
the same house as his wife and kids.

656
00:54:59,105 --> 00:55:02,945
They're perfect. This is like TV.

657
00:55:03,985 --> 00:55:07,705
Maybe they'll adopt me.

658
00:55:07,705 --> 00:55:11,545
Do you like bacon?

659
00:55:11,825 --> 00:55:15,625
How about sausage?

660
00:55:16,505 --> 00:55:20,345
Toast?
I love toast.

661
00:55:20,345 --> 00:55:23,345
What's your name?
Sal.

662
00:55:23,345 --> 00:55:26,825
How could you lie?
They're being so nice.

663
00:55:26,825 --> 00:55:28,585
Sal, what?

664
00:55:28,585 --> 00:55:32,145
Val. Sal Val.

665
00:55:32,145 --> 00:55:33,985
My parents love rhymes.

666
00:55:33,985 --> 00:55:36,465
We stay up late at night
to think of new ones.

667
00:55:36,465 --> 00:55:40,265
Me, Mom, Dad,
Sis and my big brother, Al.

668
00:55:57,665 --> 00:56:01,425
She's all right. She's in New Haven.

669
00:56:01,425 --> 00:56:04,705
Could you give me
that address again, please?

670
00:56:04,705 --> 00:56:08,265
When I was little, we lived in Brazil
and owned a diamond mine.

671
00:56:08,265 --> 00:56:10,505
My father would always dance with me.

672
00:56:10,505 --> 00:56:14,345
We would dance and dance
in the middle of the jungle.

673
00:56:14,345 --> 00:56:18,185
And me and my sister,
she has these beautiful long, red curls

674
00:56:18,305 --> 00:56:21,425
and she wears
a jewelled crown on her head...

675
00:56:21,425 --> 00:56:24,905
What we would do is
we would make this pear wine.

676
00:56:24,905 --> 00:56:28,545
We'd take the bottles
and hang them from tree branches

677
00:56:28,545 --> 00:56:32,385
and write on them with diamond dust.

678
00:57:41,465 --> 00:57:45,305
Do you have any idea
what you've just put me through?

679
00:57:46,105 --> 00:57:47,905
I thought you were kidnapped!

680
00:57:47,905 --> 00:57:49,825
I thought you were dead!

681
00:57:49,825 --> 00:57:53,225
I thought you were chopped
into a million pieces.

682
00:57:53,225 --> 00:57:54,945
Go to your room! I can't talk to you.

683
00:57:54,945 --> 00:57:58,785
If I talk to you I'll kill you.

684
00:58:07,385 --> 00:58:11,225
I've had a little scotch. I'm real calm

685
00:58:15,385 --> 00:58:19,225
So, tell me, Charlotte, what's going on

686
00:58:20,105 --> 00:58:23,385
You don't get it, Mom.
I think I'm pregnant.

687
00:58:23,385 --> 00:58:26,305
It may be God's child.
Are you trying to make me crazy?

688
00:58:26,305 --> 00:58:27,865
You wouldn't understand.

689
00:58:27,865 --> 00:58:31,025
You don't believe in religion,
or anything!

690
00:58:31,025 --> 00:58:32,625
Why were you running?

691
00:58:32,625 --> 00:58:35,065
Running away doesn't solve anything.

692
00:58:35,065 --> 00:58:38,705
No, I'm a grownup.
I don't run away. I move on.

693
00:58:38,705 --> 00:58:40,825
If something's bothering you, tell me!

694
00:58:40,825 --> 00:58:44,625
Maybe I can help. How bad can it be?

695
00:58:45,185 --> 00:58:49,025
Look, I'm really tired.
I just want to go to sleep, okay?

696
00:58:56,905 --> 00:58:58,465
Let me tell you something.

697
00:58:58,465 --> 00:59:01,145
Sometimes being the mother
really stinks.

698
00:59:01,145 --> 00:59:03,185
I don't always know what to do.

699
00:59:03,185 --> 00:59:06,985
You and Kate didn't come
with a book of instructions.

700
00:59:07,225 --> 00:59:10,585
If I can help you, tell me!

701
00:59:10,585 --> 00:59:14,385
I'll give it my best shot.
But that's all I can do.

702
00:59:28,865 --> 00:59:30,785
Where's Charlotte?
In her room.

703
00:59:30,785 --> 00:59:32,705
Somewhere on Mars.

704
00:59:32,705 --> 00:59:35,705
What did she tell you?
Nothing.

705
00:59:35,705 --> 00:59:37,265
Maybe her school counselor...

706
00:59:37,265 --> 00:59:39,505
Mrs Crain? Are you kidding?

707
00:59:39,505 --> 00:59:42,145
She couldn't find her ass
with both hands.

708
00:59:42,145 --> 00:59:44,425
Has she ever done anything this strange

709
00:59:44,425 --> 00:59:47,825
She did get sent home
from school once before.

710
00:59:47,825 --> 00:59:50,185
For licking chalk off a blackboard.

711
00:59:50,185 --> 00:59:52,585
Good,
her tongue was yellow for a week.

712
00:59:52,585 --> 00:59:53,745
Why did she do that?

713
00:59:53,745 --> 00:59:54,545
I don't know.

714
00:59:54,545 --> 00:59:58,345
She read in a book that a Saint had
a vision after licking a wall.

715
00:59:59,985 --> 01:00:03,785
The teacher sent home a note saying
Charlotte had psychological problems.

716
01:00:05,145 --> 01:00:08,985
What did you do?
We moved.

717
01:00:26,865 --> 01:00:28,625
I heard you ran away.

718
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:32,425
You okay?

719
01:00:33,265 --> 01:00:36,345
You want to talk about it?

720
01:00:36,345 --> 01:00:40,145
It's kind of complicated.

721
01:00:42,545 --> 01:00:46,345
I was worried.

722
01:00:50,585 --> 01:00:54,425
Joe, tell me about your girlfriend.

723
01:00:54,465 --> 01:00:57,505
My girlfriend?

724
01:00:57,505 --> 01:01:00,225
There's nothing to tell.

725
01:01:00,225 --> 01:01:02,305
Did you love her?

726
01:01:02,305 --> 01:01:04,985
Yes, I did.

727
01:01:04,985 --> 01:01:08,785
But her family moved away
and I never saw her again.

728
01:01:10,745 --> 01:01:11,745
People in town talk

729
01:01:11,745 --> 01:01:15,585
as if something happened
between us, but it didn't.

730
01:01:20,545 --> 01:01:22,865
Joe, do you like babies?

731
01:01:22,865 --> 01:01:24,825
Babies?

732
01:01:24,825 --> 01:01:27,785
Sure. I love babies.

733
01:01:27,785 --> 01:01:31,625
Some day I hope to have a whole bunch.

734
01:01:41,785 --> 01:01:45,585
Joan Ark?

735
01:01:51,785 --> 01:01:52,985
Hi, I'm Dr. Reynolds.

736
01:01:52,985 --> 01:01:55,905
How do you do? I just have...
First time here?

737
01:01:55,905 --> 01:01:57,145
Yes, I just had a question.

738
01:01:57,145 --> 01:01:58,465
How's school?

739
01:01:58,465 --> 01:02:02,305
It's great.
I wish we had it on weekends.

740
01:02:03,825 --> 01:02:07,625
How old are you, Joan?
What? Eighteen.

741
01:02:08,385 --> 01:02:12,225
Is everything okay?
Is there anything inside me?

742
01:02:13,505 --> 01:02:17,345
Just get dressed
and come into my office.

743
01:02:30,385 --> 01:02:34,185
Joan, has your mother
even talked to you about sex?

744
01:02:35,105 --> 01:02:37,905
Please, God, I want to die!

745
01:02:37,905 --> 01:02:40,825
Yeah, all the time.

746
01:02:40,825 --> 01:02:44,665
You know how babies are conceived?

747
01:02:45,585 --> 01:02:49,425
Oh, yeah. We talk about everything.
She's a wonderful mother.

748
01:02:52,305 --> 01:02:56,145
Then why do you think you're pregnant?
You're a virgin.

749
01:02:58,305 --> 01:03:02,145
I want to die, right now.

750
01:03:05,945 --> 01:03:09,145
So it's crazy to think
one kiss could get you pregnant.

751
01:03:09,145 --> 01:03:10,585
But how would I know?

752
01:03:10,585 --> 01:03:11,865
What about the Virgin Mary?

753
01:03:11,865 --> 01:03:13,785
Look at Saint Perpetua?

754
01:03:13,785 --> 01:03:15,185
She transformed into a man,

755
01:03:15,185 --> 01:03:17,585
fought with the devil
and walked on his head.

756
01:03:17,585 --> 01:03:20,985
Weird things happen.

757
01:03:20,985 --> 01:03:24,825
Can you do me a favor?

758
01:03:26,785 --> 01:03:29,305
I need to go to Boston
on a jerk errand for my boss.

759
01:03:29,305 --> 01:03:31,665
Can you give the girls dinner?

760
01:03:31,665 --> 01:03:35,505
Yes! I got a great pot roast
in the freezer that Sophia left.

761
01:03:35,545 --> 01:03:36,345
Sound good?

762
01:03:36,345 --> 01:03:39,505
Antyhing hot and not shaped
like a star sounds good.

763
01:03:39,505 --> 01:03:41,385
Very funny. You know what?

764
01:03:41,385 --> 01:03:44,625
Your mouth sounds like your sister's.
I'm not pleased about that.

765
01:03:44,625 --> 01:03:47,825
The Crains
are having a party for New Year.

766
01:03:47,825 --> 01:03:49,385
Did you get an invitation?

767
01:03:49,385 --> 01:03:53,225
I'm going. Will you be there?
It's a costume party.

768
01:03:53,545 --> 01:03:55,505
What do you think?
Go.

769
01:03:55,505 --> 01:03:58,945
As what?
A goldfish!

770
01:03:58,945 --> 01:04:02,785
Well, you're a big help.

771
01:04:06,265 --> 01:04:10,105
As always, it was a pleasure.

772
01:04:10,345 --> 01:04:12,945
Oklahoma

773
01:04:12,945 --> 01:04:15,745
When the wind comes
sweeping down the plains

774
01:04:15,745 --> 01:04:19,105
And the waving wheat
can sure smell sweet

775
01:04:19,105 --> 01:04:22,705
When the wind
comes right behind the rain

776
01:04:22,705 --> 01:04:25,345
Oklahoma

777
01:04:25,345 --> 01:04:29,185
Every night my honey lamb and I...

778
01:04:56,465 --> 01:04:58,145
Where is everybody?

779
01:04:58,145 --> 01:04:59,545
In here!

780
01:04:59,545 --> 01:05:03,385
Well, where's here... What is this?

781
01:05:04,665 --> 01:05:06,065
Hey, what's going on in here?

782
01:05:06,065 --> 01:05:07,105
Young Esther Williams

783
01:05:07,105 --> 01:05:10,705
wanted to know what sleeping under
the sea would be like.

784
01:05:10,705 --> 01:05:13,225
Her wish being my command, hey, presto!

785
01:05:13,225 --> 01:05:15,305
Wall-to-wall ocean.

786
01:05:15,305 --> 01:05:17,625
You're certifiable, you know that?

787
01:05:17,625 --> 01:05:19,985
Then I'm with the right family.

788
01:05:19,985 --> 01:05:23,305
Let's show her.

789
01:05:23,305 --> 01:05:27,145
I'll do it.

790
01:05:27,705 --> 01:05:30,225
Oh, that is so neat.

791
01:05:30,225 --> 01:05:34,025
It's beautiful.

792
01:05:34,105 --> 01:05:36,625
So how's that? Sitting under the ocean.

793
01:05:36,625 --> 01:05:39,905
Flying fish and everything.

794
01:05:39,905 --> 01:05:43,145
It's good.

795
01:05:43,145 --> 01:05:45,185
Oh, dinner's ready!

796
01:05:45,185 --> 01:05:49,025
Let's eat. I'm so hungry.

797
01:06:04,465 --> 01:06:07,345
You did all that
in one evening and cooked too?

798
01:06:07,345 --> 01:06:10,385
Charlotte we have to thank for dinner.

799
01:06:10,385 --> 01:06:12,745
A feast to put Sophia to shame.

800
01:06:12,745 --> 01:06:16,345
Where did you learn how to do this?
Home Economics.

801
01:06:16,345 --> 01:06:20,145
If the way to a man's heart is through
his stomach, there's hope for you yet.

802
01:06:20,905 --> 01:06:24,745
Personally, I don't think that's true.

803
01:06:24,785 --> 01:06:26,465
What do men care about?

804
01:06:26,465 --> 01:06:28,225
Astroturf.

805
01:06:28,225 --> 01:06:30,265
According to Lou, it'll ruin baseball.

806
01:06:30,265 --> 01:06:31,745
Not to mention the civilized world.

807
01:06:31,745 --> 01:06:35,585
If you want a boyfriend,
you better start caring about it too.

808
01:06:37,025 --> 01:06:40,585
If you marry Lou, he can be our dad.

809
01:06:40,585 --> 01:06:41,745
We have a dad.

810
01:06:41,745 --> 01:06:44,665
I've never seen him.
He wouldn't make me an ocean.

811
01:06:44,665 --> 01:06:45,625
Can we sleep over?

812
01:06:45,625 --> 01:06:47,905
Please?
No!

813
01:06:47,905 --> 01:06:51,745
I'll think about it.

814
01:06:55,505 --> 01:06:57,265
Actually, you should have 2 forks.
Why?

815
01:06:57,265 --> 01:06:59,185
You know what happened

816
01:06:59,185 --> 01:07:01,145
if we used the wrong fork
when I was a kid?

817
01:07:01,145 --> 01:07:04,065
We had to stick them in the ground.

818
01:07:04,065 --> 01:07:06,145
Even if the ground was frozen.

819
01:07:06,145 --> 01:07:09,385
We called it the hardware garden.
Believe that?

820
01:07:09,385 --> 01:07:13,225
That's nothing. This kid's uncle died
and got sprinkled in the garden.

821
01:07:13,785 --> 01:07:14,825
That's nothing.

822
01:07:14,825 --> 01:07:18,665
St. Maragaret of Antioch got eaten
by a dragon. And it burst!

823
01:07:19,265 --> 01:07:21,105
When I die,
I want to be sprinkled in the ocean.

824
01:07:21,105 --> 01:07:24,865
I could live inside a whale, like Jonah

825
01:07:24,865 --> 01:07:28,145
What if the whale
doesn't have a living room

826
01:07:28,145 --> 01:07:30,785
and you end up in a tuna fish sandwich?

827
01:07:30,785 --> 01:07:31,865
Who are they?

828
01:07:31,865 --> 01:07:33,585
Once a man ate
at our table without his shirt.

829
01:07:33,585 --> 01:07:35,825
Like we were nudists!

830
01:07:35,825 --> 01:07:38,785
Oh, yeah! He yanked quarters
out of your ears!

831
01:07:38,785 --> 01:07:40,705
Why'd he do that?

832
01:07:40,705 --> 01:07:44,025
I think so he wouldn't spill
his dinner on it.

833
01:07:44,025 --> 01:07:45,945
Cranberry sauce, please
Some chicken?

834
01:07:45,945 --> 01:07:47,865
What's happening?

835
01:07:47,865 --> 01:07:51,705
What usually happens when families
sit down to eat together. They talk!

836
01:07:52,385 --> 01:07:55,025
Cranberry sauce?
Chicken, anyone?

837
01:07:55,025 --> 01:07:58,825
I do!
I'd love some!

838
01:08:05,185 --> 01:08:06,465
Wait.

839
01:08:06,465 --> 01:08:09,945
I never said you could do this.

840
01:08:09,945 --> 01:08:12,505
Let Kate get so attached.

841
01:08:12,505 --> 01:08:14,105
Is that terrible?

842
01:08:14,105 --> 01:08:16,625
This is not your family.

843
01:08:16,625 --> 01:08:18,705
If you want to be close, dial direct.

844
01:08:18,705 --> 01:08:22,505
But don't do it through my kids.

845
01:08:30,225 --> 01:08:34,065
Never in my life have I wanted to hit
a woman as much as I do you.

846
01:08:42,865 --> 01:08:46,705
When you are wrong
you're so wrong, it's scary!

847
01:08:59,025 --> 01:09:02,865
You've never done something
just to make somebody happy?!

848
01:09:03,385 --> 01:09:05,065
What do you want?

849
01:09:05,065 --> 01:09:07,465
A little trust would be nice!

850
01:09:07,465 --> 01:09:11,105
And if you care about us,
would it kill you to show it?!

851
01:09:11,105 --> 01:09:12,785
What do you mean, us?

852
01:09:12,785 --> 01:09:16,185
Since when did you
and my kids become us?

853
01:09:16,185 --> 01:09:17,465
You're just you, Lou.

854
01:09:17,465 --> 01:09:21,305
Me and the girls, that's us!

855
01:09:24,945 --> 01:09:28,785
I was talking about you and me.

856
01:09:42,505 --> 01:09:44,985
If you don't hurry,
it'll be New Year's Day!

857
01:09:44,985 --> 01:09:46,345
You'll miss the party!

858
01:09:46,345 --> 01:09:48,825
Here's a little something.

859
01:09:48,825 --> 01:09:49,745
An arm!

860
01:09:49,745 --> 01:09:50,785
This year, Mom!

861
01:09:50,785 --> 01:09:53,025
All right. Here's a little more!

862
01:09:53,025 --> 01:09:55,585
Are you ready?
This is boring!

863
01:09:55,585 --> 01:09:58,105
One, two, three, here I am!

864
01:09:58,105 --> 01:09:59,625
You're a mermaid!

865
01:09:59,625 --> 01:10:03,465
No, I'm a lumberjack! A salesman!
You're beautiful!

866
01:10:04,145 --> 01:10:04,785
What do you think?

867
01:10:04,785 --> 01:10:06,505
If I'd had this when you were little

868
01:10:06,505 --> 01:10:10,345
I'd have done my ironing
and the diapers in it.

869
01:10:15,185 --> 01:10:18,065
Is this the mermaid bus?

870
01:10:18,065 --> 01:10:21,705
I can see it's mermaid time
to get into my mermaid car

871
01:10:21,705 --> 01:10:22,705
and hit the mermaid road.

872
01:10:22,705 --> 01:10:25,465
Get the mermaid out of here.
Get my mermaid coat.

873
01:10:25,465 --> 01:10:27,425
Get my mermaid keys.

874
01:10:27,425 --> 01:10:29,705
Oh, my God.

875
01:10:29,705 --> 01:10:33,425
I don't think
I'll be fresh for the party.

876
01:10:33,425 --> 01:10:36,345
'Bye, Mom! Have fun!

877
01:10:36,345 --> 01:10:39,185
Have a good time!
I will!

878
01:10:39,185 --> 01:10:43,025
Good-bye, Mrs. Mermaid!
Good-bye, Junior Mermaids!

879
01:11:01,705 --> 01:11:04,785
Where's that handsome hunk of
a husband of yours?

880
01:11:04,785 --> 01:11:07,505
Out front talking baseball.

881
01:11:07,505 --> 01:11:11,305
He bet $20 they couldn't name 3
players that batted over.400.

882
01:11:11,625 --> 01:11:15,225
Be right back.

883
01:11:15,225 --> 01:11:19,065
Ty Cobb, Joe Jackson, Naps Lajoie!
You owe me twenty bucks.

884
01:11:20,585 --> 01:11:24,265
Last day ever, every of this year.

885
01:11:24,265 --> 01:11:26,825
Want to make some resolutions?

886
01:11:26,825 --> 01:11:28,945
What are resolutions?

887
01:11:28,945 --> 01:11:31,585
They're sort of like wishes.

888
01:11:31,585 --> 01:11:35,425
I wish I could swim forever.

889
01:11:36,385 --> 01:11:39,425
I wish I'd known Anne Frank.

890
01:11:39,425 --> 01:11:43,265
And that I didn't lust
after Joe so much.

891
01:11:46,505 --> 01:11:50,345
Put that right here. We can use that.

892
01:11:50,465 --> 01:11:54,305
Why don't you stay and have a drink?
It's almost midnight.

893
01:11:57,185 --> 01:11:58,665
Hi, handsome.

894
01:11:58,665 --> 01:12:00,465
Nice caretaker's costume.

895
01:12:00,465 --> 01:12:04,265
You look nice.

896
01:12:04,425 --> 01:12:08,265
It's time you and I had a little dance.

897
01:12:11,425 --> 01:12:12,905
Little Bo Peep.

898
01:12:12,905 --> 01:12:16,745
Can you help with these?

899
01:12:17,985 --> 01:12:20,465
Now, spin me.

900
01:12:20,465 --> 01:12:22,585
Watch my tail.
Sorry.

901
01:12:22,585 --> 01:12:25,545
I'm on pins and needles.
Did you win the $20?

902
01:12:25,545 --> 01:12:29,065
What do you think?
I'm planning a pilgrimage.

903
01:12:29,065 --> 01:12:30,785
To Lourdes?
No, Cooperstown.

904
01:12:30,785 --> 01:12:32,425
Ask why.

905
01:12:32,425 --> 01:12:33,425
I'll tell you.

906
01:12:33,425 --> 01:12:36,985
I thought so.

907
01:12:36,985 --> 01:12:38,705
The Baseball Hall of Fame.

908
01:12:38,705 --> 01:12:42,545
Before I die,
there's 3 things I want from life.

909
01:12:43,985 --> 01:12:45,865
To touch Lou Gehrig's glove.

910
01:12:45,865 --> 01:12:49,705
To be in Florida for Spring Training.

911
01:12:49,705 --> 01:12:51,825
And to take you with me.

912
01:12:51,825 --> 01:12:54,425
Two out of three's not bad.

913
01:12:54,425 --> 01:12:56,185
Ask me in a couple months.

914
01:12:56,185 --> 01:12:57,585
If you're still here.
Exactly.

915
01:12:57,585 --> 01:12:59,185
Two minutes everybody!

916
01:12:59,185 --> 01:13:02,985
Turn up the TV.

917
01:13:10,385 --> 01:13:12,985
What are we going to do?
About what?

918
01:13:12,985 --> 01:13:15,745
This relationship.
What's wrong with it?

919
01:13:15,745 --> 01:13:19,065
It's stuck.
It has to move or it has to end.

920
01:13:19,065 --> 01:13:21,305
It can't just stay the same.

921
01:13:21,305 --> 01:13:24,345
Ultimatums
don't sit really well with me.

922
01:13:24,345 --> 01:13:28,185
Noisemakers?

923
01:13:29,785 --> 01:13:32,425
What if I asked you to marry me?

924
01:13:32,425 --> 01:13:33,945
I'd remind you
that you're still married.

925
01:13:33,945 --> 01:13:37,785
Then, I'd write. From New Mexico.

926
01:13:38,865 --> 01:13:42,705
Live with me.

927
01:13:43,705 --> 01:13:47,545
Seven... six... five... four...
three... two... one!

928
01:14:15,425 --> 01:14:19,265
Well, so far, 1964's a big drag.

929
01:14:19,625 --> 01:14:23,465
Are you coming home with me?

930
01:14:24,505 --> 01:14:27,825
Another night.

931
01:14:27,825 --> 01:14:31,665
Happy New Year's.

932
01:14:51,505 --> 01:14:55,305
I think my car's dead.

933
01:14:55,425 --> 01:14:59,265
Think so?

934
01:15:00,305 --> 01:15:03,065
Can you help me?

935
01:15:03,065 --> 01:15:06,905
Good.

936
01:15:23,505 --> 01:15:26,065
Thanks for the ride, Joe.

937
01:15:26,065 --> 01:15:29,905
You bet.

938
01:15:40,425 --> 01:15:43,105
Sorry.

939
01:15:43,105 --> 01:15:44,585
Could you help me?

940
01:15:44,585 --> 01:15:48,425
I'm having trouble with this tail.

941
01:15:49,745 --> 01:15:53,545
Happy New Year.

942
01:16:00,785 --> 01:16:02,945
You kissed him?

943
01:16:02,945 --> 01:16:06,665
You kissed him?! How could you do that?

944
01:16:06,665 --> 01:16:08,105
You let her?!

945
01:16:08,105 --> 01:16:10,985
It was just a New Year's Eve kiss!

946
01:16:10,985 --> 01:16:14,745
You don't believe in New Year's.
I know.

947
01:16:14,745 --> 01:16:16,345
What are you guys fighting about?

948
01:16:16,345 --> 01:16:18,505
Nothing.
Everything.

949
01:16:18,505 --> 01:16:21,665
Get inside
before you freeze your butt off.

950
01:16:21,665 --> 01:16:23,825
Is Charlotte going to run away again?

951
01:16:23,825 --> 01:16:25,945
God willing. Just kidding.

952
01:16:25,945 --> 01:16:28,625
Did you have a nice time?
Lovely, thank you.

953
01:16:28,625 --> 01:16:32,345
Staying there all night,
Miss Poopy Face?

954
01:16:32,345 --> 01:16:34,225
Why did you let her?!

955
01:16:34,225 --> 01:16:36,865
She kisses everybody,
don't you know that?!

956
01:16:36,865 --> 01:16:39,225
It doesn't mean you're special!

957
01:16:39,225 --> 01:16:43,065
It doesn't mean
she likes you or anything!

958
01:16:43,505 --> 01:16:47,345
She doesn't like anybody!

959
01:17:15,865 --> 01:17:19,705
Okay, Mom, you want to drive Lou away,
that's your business.

960
01:17:20,705 --> 01:17:24,545
You want Joe, that's war.

961
01:17:34,825 --> 01:17:38,665
You give me fever

962
01:17:41,505 --> 01:17:44,945
Fever

963
01:17:44,945 --> 01:17:47,025
Care to dance, Mrs. Flax?

964
01:17:47,025 --> 01:17:50,865
Mrs. Polka Flax.

965
01:17:52,865 --> 01:17:55,065
She'll kill you if you wear that.

966
01:17:55,065 --> 01:17:58,905
Go back to your rocks.

967
01:18:07,185 --> 01:18:10,465
Act your age, not your shoe size.

968
01:18:10,465 --> 01:18:12,025
Who's this?

969
01:18:12,025 --> 01:18:13,945
Know your colors and your fabrics.

970
01:18:13,945 --> 01:18:17,785
That's what I tell all my little girls.

971
01:18:21,905 --> 01:18:25,425
Shall I tell you a secret?

972
01:18:25,425 --> 01:18:27,385
I'm in love with Joe.

973
01:18:27,385 --> 01:18:28,825
Do you kiss each other?

974
01:18:28,825 --> 01:18:31,065
On the lips?

975
01:18:31,065 --> 01:18:33,345
Like Superman and Lois Lane?

976
01:18:33,345 --> 01:18:37,185
What's it like?

977
01:18:37,745 --> 01:18:40,665
Sometimes when you kiss a person,
nothing happens.

978
01:18:40,665 --> 01:18:43,545
It's like kissing your hand
or yourself in the mirror.

979
01:18:43,545 --> 01:18:46,065
But when you love someone...

980
01:18:46,065 --> 01:18:48,465
I know. Chemicals.

981
01:18:48,465 --> 01:18:50,385
You mean chemistry, fish head.

982
01:18:50,385 --> 01:18:52,305
How do I look?

983
01:18:52,305 --> 01:18:55,985
Like someone drew all over you.

984
01:18:55,985 --> 01:18:58,865
Let's celebrate.
Cool.

985
01:18:58,865 --> 01:19:02,705
Never knew how much something... I care

986
01:19:07,665 --> 01:19:09,105
What are you doing?

987
01:19:09,105 --> 01:19:12,425
Sucking out the pimentos.
They give me hernias.

988
01:19:12,425 --> 01:19:15,345
You mean hives, fish head.

989
01:19:15,345 --> 01:19:17,745
Hit me, sergeant!

990
01:19:17,745 --> 01:19:21,585
Okay, but you can only have one.
And you have to sip it.

991
01:19:24,385 --> 01:19:28,225
Fever

992
01:19:29,585 --> 01:19:33,425
You're giving me fever

993
01:19:35,985 --> 01:19:38,865
Tell me about when I was born.

994
01:19:38,865 --> 01:19:42,665
Aren't you sick of hearing this story?

995
01:19:44,905 --> 01:19:47,025
You were born

996
01:19:47,025 --> 01:19:50,825
in a hospital in Minneapolis
on a cold winter's day.

997
01:19:51,025 --> 01:19:54,825
When Mrs. Flax brought you home
I pretended you were mine.

998
01:19:55,825 --> 01:19:58,825
Where was Pop?

999
01:19:58,825 --> 01:20:02,665
I don't know.

1000
01:20:09,265 --> 01:20:13,105
Come on, I'll show you the convent.

1001
01:20:22,865 --> 01:20:24,825
Finish the story.

1002
01:20:24,825 --> 01:20:28,665
I'll show you the tower.
You've never seen it.

1003
01:20:59,985 --> 01:21:01,265
There it is!

1004
01:21:01,265 --> 01:21:03,345
Isn't it neat?

1005
01:21:03,345 --> 01:21:06,065
I want to go up. I'm going.

1006
01:21:06,065 --> 01:21:09,905
Not me. I'll fall off.
No you won't.

1007
01:21:10,345 --> 01:21:12,545
How can you go in those shoes?

1008
01:21:12,545 --> 01:21:14,785
I'll manage.

1009
01:21:14,785 --> 01:21:16,625
I'll go get rocks.

1010
01:21:16,625 --> 01:21:20,425
I'll be right back. Don't go anywhere.

1011
01:23:11,345 --> 01:23:13,945
Oh, God. This is real.

1012
01:23:13,945 --> 01:23:17,785
This is really real.

1013
01:24:04,785 --> 01:24:08,585
Get her inside.

1014
01:24:16,345 --> 01:24:20,185
Joseph, get an ambulance.

1015
01:24:20,785 --> 01:24:24,585
Katie, please don't die. Please.

1016
01:24:58,385 --> 01:25:02,185
Take Charlotte home.
We'll call when there's news. Tell Lou.

1017
01:27:17,585 --> 01:27:21,425
Katydid.

1018
01:27:22,585 --> 01:27:26,425
You were born in a hospital
in Minneapolis on a cold winter day.

1019
01:27:28,825 --> 01:27:32,665
I brought you home
and Charlotte pretended you were hers.

1020
01:27:34,705 --> 01:27:38,545
She even tried to make you call her Mom

1021
01:27:40,785 --> 01:27:44,585
We tickled your ears
and we watched you sleep.

1022
01:27:49,145 --> 01:27:51,785
And the only thing...

1023
01:27:51,785 --> 01:27:55,625
The only thing we ever agreed on
was that you were... a wonderful child.

1024
01:28:47,825 --> 01:28:49,745
She'll be all right.

1025
01:28:49,745 --> 01:28:53,585
They're keeping her in one more night
for observation.

1026
01:28:55,665 --> 01:28:59,505
Your mother's on her way home.

1027
01:29:15,185 --> 01:29:19,025
She's okay.

1028
01:29:21,105 --> 01:29:24,905
She's okay.

1029
01:29:41,345 --> 01:29:45,185
You look different.

1030
01:29:45,265 --> 01:29:49,105
You look beautiful.

1031
01:29:56,225 --> 01:29:57,705
Take care.

1032
01:29:57,705 --> 01:30:01,545
You too.

1033
01:31:04,745 --> 01:31:08,585
Be smart and stay away from me.

1034
01:31:22,065 --> 01:31:25,865
I mean it.

1035
01:31:33,985 --> 01:31:36,585
Want to take the book for her?

1036
01:31:36,585 --> 01:31:39,585
What were you doing? She could've died!

1037
01:31:39,585 --> 01:31:42,625
You were supposed to watch her.
She could've died!

1038
01:31:42,625 --> 01:31:44,065
What the hell were you doing up there?!

1039
01:31:44,065 --> 01:31:45,145
I know what you were doing.

1040
01:31:45,145 --> 01:31:48,985
The whole goddamn town knows
what you were doing!

1041
01:31:51,025 --> 01:31:54,865
I'm warning you! I'm crazy angry!

1042
01:31:59,425 --> 01:32:02,705
Don't walk away!
Don't walk away from me!

1043
01:32:02,705 --> 01:32:04,625
I ma not invisible!

1044
01:32:04,625 --> 01:32:08,425
Talk to me!

1045
01:32:08,545 --> 01:32:10,225
Yes, I made a mistake!

1046
01:32:10,225 --> 01:32:13,985
Yes, I am really sorry!
It was a big mistake!!

1047
01:32:13,985 --> 01:32:16,025
I know that!

1048
01:32:16,025 --> 01:32:19,225
You're always screwing up
and we always pay for it!

1049
01:32:19,225 --> 01:32:22,345
Every time you get dumped
or dump on somebody.

1050
01:32:22,345 --> 01:32:24,825
It's not fair!

1051
01:32:24,825 --> 01:32:28,665
It is not fair!

1052
01:32:41,625 --> 01:32:44,945
I'm tired of being judged by you!
You're a kid!

1053
01:32:44,945 --> 01:32:47,385
When you're an adult, live how you awnt

1054
01:32:47,385 --> 01:32:51,225
Until then,
we will live my life, my way!

1055
01:32:54,265 --> 01:32:58,105
Pack!

1056
01:32:58,545 --> 01:32:59,465
This move is on you!

1057
01:32:59,465 --> 01:33:01,825
If loverboy doesn't like it, too bad!

1058
01:33:01,825 --> 01:33:04,265
This is not about him, it's about me.

1059
01:33:04,265 --> 01:33:06,065
That's over! He's left!

1060
01:33:06,065 --> 01:33:08,945
Surprise!
It's not like that!

1061
01:33:08,945 --> 01:33:11,665
Maybe your life works for you
but it doesn't work for me!

1062
01:33:11,665 --> 01:33:12,785
I'm staying.

1063
01:33:12,785 --> 01:33:14,545
And do what?
Finish high school.

1064
01:33:14,545 --> 01:33:16,865
What's your major? Town tramp?

1065
01:33:16,865 --> 01:33:20,705
No, Mom. The town already has one.

1066
01:33:53,145 --> 01:33:56,985
You're just one year younger
than I was when I had you.

1067
01:33:59,025 --> 01:34:00,345
If you hate my life so much,

1068
01:34:00,345 --> 01:34:04,185
why are you trying so hard
to make the same mistakes?

1069
01:34:11,985 --> 01:34:15,825
How do you feel about this guy?

1070
01:34:16,305 --> 01:34:18,505
I thought I loved him.

1071
01:34:18,505 --> 01:34:21,865
Sounds familiar.

1072
01:34:21,865 --> 01:34:25,705
I thought you would take him away.

1073
01:34:37,385 --> 01:34:39,185
Did you love my father?

1074
01:34:39,185 --> 01:34:42,985
Yeah, I did.

1075
01:34:46,705 --> 01:34:50,545
What was he like?

1076
01:34:51,665 --> 01:34:54,545
He was charming and...

1077
01:34:54,545 --> 01:34:58,345
he made me feel really special
for about a minute and a half.

1078
01:34:59,025 --> 01:35:02,825
Then he was gone.

1079
01:35:03,945 --> 01:35:07,785
What did he look like?
Like you, only taller.

1080
01:35:08,945 --> 01:35:10,865
I don't have any pictures.

1081
01:35:10,865 --> 01:35:14,705
We took pictures at the wedding
and they didn't come out.

1082
01:35:14,945 --> 01:35:18,145
I guess I should have known then.

1083
01:35:18,145 --> 01:35:19,985
He's never coming back, is he?

1084
01:35:19,985 --> 01:35:23,785
No.

1085
01:35:25,025 --> 01:35:26,905
Has he ever seen me?

1086
01:35:26,905 --> 01:35:30,745
He did once. You were about 4.

1087
01:35:31,865 --> 01:35:33,185
He wanted us back?

1088
01:35:33,185 --> 01:35:37,025
No. He met another woman
and he wanted to get married.

1089
01:35:42,225 --> 01:35:46,065
How do you feel about Joe leaving?

1090
01:35:50,065 --> 01:35:53,865
It's fine.

1091
01:35:55,105 --> 01:35:58,945
I guess it's too later for our birds
and bees talk, isn't it?

1092
01:36:03,385 --> 01:36:07,225
Mom, can we please stay?

1093
01:36:12,265 --> 01:36:14,385
I don't know.
There's going to be so much talk.

1094
01:36:14,385 --> 01:36:16,785
It's a small town.

1095
01:36:16,785 --> 01:36:20,585
There's always talk.
It's just usually about you.

1096
01:36:22,025 --> 01:36:25,865
I'm sorry.

1097
01:36:30,465 --> 01:36:34,305
Just for a year. Give it a year.

1098
01:36:40,145 --> 01:36:43,985
I don't know.

1099
01:36:51,185 --> 01:36:54,985
Mrs. Flax promised
she'd try and stay put.

1100
01:36:55,265 --> 01:36:59,105
I knew that would be hard for her.

1101
01:37:10,425 --> 01:37:14,265
But 3 months later
she and Lou were still sparring.

1102
01:37:15,825 --> 01:37:19,305
He took us to the Baseball Hall of Fame
His heaven.

1103
01:37:19,305 --> 01:37:23,145
Mom was bored
but we thought she hid it quite well.

1104
01:37:27,025 --> 01:37:30,865
This is Lou Gehrig's glove.
You see that?

1105
01:37:30,905 --> 01:37:33,385
Okay, you touched it. All right, guys.

1106
01:37:33,385 --> 01:37:37,225
What's for lunch?

1107
01:37:45,265 --> 01:37:47,825
If they squeeze your toes,
chew it awhile.

1108
01:37:47,825 --> 01:37:49,465
Is softens them.

1109
01:37:49,465 --> 01:37:52,825
You don't believe me.
Eskimos do it all the time.

1110
01:37:52,825 --> 01:37:55,785
The wives do it.
Would you do it for your old man?

1111
01:37:55,785 --> 01:37:59,625
I don't think so. 'Bye.

1112
01:38:01,425 --> 01:38:03,265
Give me a break!

1113
01:38:03,265 --> 01:38:06,145
I'm a nice old man.
I'd watch it, Lou.

1114
01:38:06,145 --> 01:38:08,625
I might decide to move to a real city.

1115
01:38:08,625 --> 01:38:12,425
I hate all these trees and weather.

1116
01:38:13,225 --> 01:38:17,065
She won't admit it,
but they get along real well.

1117
01:38:19,505 --> 01:38:23,305
Trees and weather can get to a person.

1118
01:38:40,145 --> 01:38:42,905
I got quite a reputation for awhile.

1119
01:38:42,905 --> 01:38:45,545
Even Mary O'Brien was impressed.

1120
01:38:45,545 --> 01:38:49,385
It's not easy, but I'm trying
to keep romance on the back burner.

1121
01:38:58,225 --> 01:39:00,945
Joe moved to California
and opened a nursery.

1122
01:39:00,945 --> 01:39:04,745
We write. He sends me funny postcards
